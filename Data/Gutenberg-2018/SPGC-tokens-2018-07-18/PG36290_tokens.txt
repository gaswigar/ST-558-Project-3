chapter
i
on
leaving
ormond
house
constantia
was
met
by
that
gentleman
he
saw
her
as
she
came
out
and
was
charmed
with
the
simplicity
of
her
appearance
on
entering
he
interrogated
the
servant
as
to
the
business
that
brought
her
thither
so
said
he
as
he
entered
the
where
craig
was
seated
you
have
had
a
visitant
she
came
it
seems
on
a
pressing
occasion
and
would
be
put
off
with
nothing
but
a
letter
craig
had
not
expected
this
address
but
it
only
precipitated
the
execution
of
a
design
that
he
had
formed
being
aware
of
this
or
similar
accidents
he
had
constructed
and
related
on
a
previous
occasion
to
ormond
a
story
suitable
to
his
purpose
ay
said
he
in
a
tone
of
affected
compassion
it
is
a
sad
affair
enough
i
am
sorry
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
help
the
poor
girl
she
is
wrong
in
imputing
her
father
misfortunes
to
me
but
i
know
the
source
of
her
mistake
would
to
heaven
it
was
in
my
flower
to
repair
the
wrongs
they
have
suffered
not
from
me
but
from
one
whose
relationship
is
a
disgrace
to
me
perhaps
replied
the
other
you
are
willing
to
explain
this
affair
yes
i
wish
to
explain
it
i
was
afraid
of
some
such
accident
as
this
an
explanation
is
due
to
my
character
i
have
already
told
you
my
story
i
mentioned
to
you
a
brother
of
mine
there
is
scarcely
thirteen
months
difference
in
our
ages
there
is
a
strong
resemblance
between
him
and
me
in
our
exterior
though
i
hope
there
is
none
at
all
in
our
minds
this
brother
was
a
partner
of
a
gentleman
the
father
of
this
girl
at
new
york
he
was
a
long
time
nothing
better
than
an
apprentice
to
dudley
but
he
advanced
so
much
in
the
good
graces
of
his
master
that
he
finally
took
him
into
partnership
i
did
not
know
till
i
arrived
on
the
continent
the
whole
of
his
misconduct
it
appears
that
he
embezzled
the
property
of
the
house
and
fled
away
with
it
and
the
consequence
was
that
his
quondam
master
was
ruined
i
am
often
mistaken
for
my
brother
to
my
no
small
inconvenience
but
all
this
i
told
you
formerly
see
what
a
letter
i
just
now
received
from
this
girl
craig
was
one
of
the
most
plausible
of
men
his
character
was
a
standing
proof
of
the
vanity
of
physiognomy
there
were
few
men
who
could
refuse
their
confidence
to
his
open
and
ingenuous
aspect
to
this
circumstance
perhaps
he
owed
his
ruin
his
temptations
to
deceive
were
stronger
than
what
are
incident
to
most
other
men
deception
was
so
easy
a
task
that
the
difficulty
lay
not
in
infusing
false
opinions
respecting
him
but
in
preventing
them
from
being
spontaneously
imbibed
he
contracted
habits
of
imposture
imperceptibly
in
proportion
as
he
deviated
from
the
practice
of
truth
he
discerned
the
necessity
of
extending
and
systematizing
his
efforts
and
of
augmenting
the
original
benignity
and
attractiveness
of
his
looks
by
studied
additions
the
further
he
proceeded
the
more
difficult
it
was
to
return
experience
and
habit
added
daily
to
his
speciousness
till
at
length
the
world
perhaps
might
have
been
searched
in
vain
for
his
competitor
he
had
been
introduced
to
ormond
under
the
most
favourable
auspices
he
had
provided
against
a
danger
which
he
knew
to
be
imminent
by
relating
his
own
story
as
if
it
were
his
brother
he
had
however
made
various
additions
to
it
serving
to
aggravate
the
heinousness
of
his
guilt
this
arose
partly
from
policy
and
partly
from
the
habit
of
lying
which
was
prompted
by
a
fertile
invention
and
rendered
inveterate
by
incessant
exercise
he
interwove
in
his
tale
an
intrigue
between
miss
dudley
and
his
brother
the
former
was
seduced
and
this
man
had
employed
his
skill
in
chirographical
imitation
in
composing
letters
from
miss
dudley
to
his
brother
which
sufficiently
attested
her
dishonour
he
and
his
brother
he
related
to
have
met
in
jamaica
where
the
latter
died
by
which
meant
his
personal
property
and
papers
came
into
his
possession
ormond
read
the
letter
which
his
companion
presented
to
him
on
this
occasion
the
papers
which
craig
had
formerly
permitted
him
to
inspect
had
made
him
familiar
with
her
handwriting
the
penmanship
was
indeed
similar
yet
this
was
written
in
a
spirit
not
quite
congenial
with
that
which
had
dictated
her
letters
to
her
lover
but
he
reflected
that
the
emergency
was
extraordinary
and
that
the
new
scenes
through
which
she
had
passed
had
perhaps
enabled
her
to
retrieve
her
virtue
and
enforce
it
the
picture
which
she
drew
of
her
father
distresses
affected
him
and
his
companion
very
differently
he
pondered
on
it
for
some
time
in
silence
he
then
looked
up
and
with
his
usual
abruptness
said
i
suppose
you
gave
her
something
no
i
was
extremely
sorry
that
it
was
not
in
my
power
i
have
nothing
but
a
little
trifling
silver
about
me
i
i
have
no
more
at
home
than
will
barely
suffice
to
pay
my
board
here
and
my
expenses
to
baltimore
till
i
reach
there
i
can
not
expect
a
supply
i
was
less
uneasy
i
confess
on
this
account
because
i
knew
you
to
be
equally
willing
and
much
more
able
to
afford
the
relief
she
asks
this
ormond
had
predetermined
to
do
he
paused
only
to
deliberate
in
what
manner
it
could
with
most
propriety
be
done
he
was
always
willing
when
he
conferred
benefits
to
conceal
the
author
he
was
not
displeased
when
gratitude
was
misplaced
and
readily
allowed
his
instruments
to
act
as
if
they
were
principals
he
questioned
not
the
veracity
of
craig
and
was
therefore
desirous
to
free
him
from
the
molestation
that
was
threatened
in
the
way
which
had
been
prescribed
he
put
a
note
of
one
hundred
dollars
into
his
hand
and
enjoined
him
to
send
it
to
the
dudleys
that
evening
or
early
the
next
morning
i
am
pleased
he
added
with
the
style
of
this
letter
it
can
be
of
no
service
to
you
leave
it
in
my
possession
craig
would
much
rather
have
thrown
it
into
the
fire
but
he
knew
the
character
of
his
companion
and
was
afraid
to
make
any
objection
to
his
request
he
promised
to
send
or
carry
the
note
the
next
morning
before
he
set
out
on
his
intended
journey
this
journey
was
to
baltimore
and
was
undertaken
so
soon
merely
to
oblige
his
friend
who
was
desirous
of
remitting
to
baltimore
a
considerable
sum
in
english
guineas
and
who
had
been
for
some
time
in
search
of
one
who
might
execute
this
commission
with
fidelity
the
offer
of
craig
had
been
joyfully
accepted
and
next
morning
had
been
the
time
fixed
for
his
departure
a
period
the
most
opportune
for
craig
designs
that
could
be
imagined
to
return
to
miss
dudley
the
sum
that
remained
to
her
after
the
discharge
of
her
debts
would
quickly
be
expended
it
was
no
argument
of
wisdom
to
lose
sight
of
the
future
in
the
oblivion
of
present
care
the
time
would
inevitably
come
when
new
resources
would
be
necessary
every
hour
brought
nearer
the
period
without
facilitating
the
discovery
of
new
expedients
she
related
the
recent
adventure
to
her
father
he
acquiesced
in
the
propriety
of
her
measures
but
the
succour
that
she
had
thus
obtained
consoled
him
but
little
he
saw
how
speedily
it
would
again
be
required
and
was
hopeless
of
a
like
fortunate
occurrence
some
days
had
elapsed
and
constantia
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
procure
some
employment
she
was
thus
engaged
in
the
evening
when
they
were
surprised
by
a
visit
from
their
landlord
this
was
an
occurrence
that
foreboded
them
no
good
he
entered
with
abruptness
and
scarcely
noticed
the
salutations
that
he
received
his
bosom
swelled
with
discontent
which
seemed
ready
to
be
poured
out
upon
his
two
companions
to
the
inquiry
as
to
the
condition
of
his
health
and
that
of
his
family
he
surlily
answered
never
mind
how
i
am
none
the
better
for
my
tenants
i
think
never
was
a
man
so
much
plagued
as
i
have
been
what
with
one
putting
me
off
from
time
to
time
what
with
another
quarrelling
about
terms
and
denying
his
agreement
and
another
running
away
in
my
debt
i
expect
nothing
but
to
come
to
poverty
god
help
me
at
last
but
this
was
the
worst
of
all
i
was
never
before
treated
so
in
all
my
life
i
do
know
what
or
when
i
shall
get
to
the
end
of
my
troubles
to
be
fobbed
out
of
my
rent
and
dollars
into
the
bargain
it
is
very
strange
treatment
i
assure
you
mr
dudley
what
is
it
you
mean
replied
that
gentleman
you
have
received
your
dues
and
received
my
dues
indeed
high
enough
too
i
have
received
none
of
my
dues
i
have
been
imposed
upon
i
have
been
put
to
very
great
trouble
and
expect
some
compensation
there
is
no
knowing
the
character
of
tenants
there
is
nothing
but
knavery
in
the
world
one
would
think
sure
no
man
has
suffered
more
by
bad
tenants
than
i
have
but
this
is
the
strangest
treatment
i
ever
met
with
very
strange
indeed
dudley
and
i
must
be
paid
without
delay
to
lose
my
rent
and
dollars
into
the
bargain
is
too
hard
i
never
met
with
the
equal
of
it
not
i
besides
i
be
put
to
all
this
trouble
for
twice
the
sum
what
does
all
this
mean
you
seem
inclined
to
scold
but
i
can
not
conceive
why
you
came
here
for
that
purpose
this
behaviour
is
improper
no
it
is
very
proper
and
i
want
payment
of
my
money
fifty
dollars
you
owe
me
miss
comes
to
pay
me
my
rent
as
i
thought
she
brings
me
a
note
i
changes
it
for
her
for
i
thought
to
be
sure
i
was
quite
safe
but
behold
when
i
sends
it
to
the
bank
to
get
the
money
they
sends
me
back
word
that
it
forged
and
calls
on
me
before
a
magistrate
to
tell
them
where
i
got
it
from
i
sure
i
never
was
so
flustered
in
my
life
i
would
not
have
such
a
thing
for
ten
times
the
sum
he
proceeded
to
descant
on
his
loss
without
any
interruption
from
his
auditors
whom
this
intelligence
had
struck
dumb
dudley
instantly
saw
the
origin
and
full
extent
of
this
misfortune
he
was
nevertheless
calm
and
indulged
in
no
invectives
against
craig
it
is
all
of
a
piece
said
he
our
ruin
is
inevitable
well
then
let
it
come
after
had
railed
himself
weary
he
flung
out
of
the
house
warning
them
that
next
morning
he
should
distrain
for
his
rent
and
at
the
same
time
sue
them
for
the
money
that
constantia
had
received
in
exchange
for
her
note
miss
dudley
was
unable
to
pursue
her
task
she
laid
down
her
needle
and
fixed
her
eyes
upon
her
father
they
had
been
engaged
in
earnest
discourse
when
their
landlord
entered
now
there
was
a
pause
of
profound
silence
till
the
affectionate
lucy
who
sufficiently
comprehended
this
scene
gave
vent
to
her
affliction
in
sobs
her
mistress
turned
to
her
cheer
up
my
lucy
we
shall
do
well
enough
my
girl
our
state
is
bad
enough
without
doubt
but
despair
will
make
it
worse
the
anxiety
that
occupied
her
mind
related
less
to
herself
than
to
her
father
he
indeed
in
the
present
instance
was
exposed
to
prosecution
it
was
he
who
was
answerable
for
the
debt
and
whose
person
would
be
thrown
into
durance
by
the
suit
that
was
menaced
the
horrors
of
a
prison
had
not
hitherto
been
experienced
or
anticipated
the
worst
evil
that
she
had
imagined
was
inexpressibly
inferior
to
this
the
idea
had
in
it
something
of
terrific
and
loathsome
the
mere
supposition
of
its
being
possible
was
not
to
be
endured
if
all
other
expedients
should
fail
she
thought
of
nothing
less
than
desperate
resistance
no
it
was
better
to
die
than
to
go
to
prison
for
a
time
she
was
deserted
of
her
admirable
equanimity
this
no
doubt
was
the
result
of
surprise
she
had
not
yet
obtained
the
calmness
necessary
to
deliberation
during
this
gloomy
interval
she
would
perhaps
have
adapted
any
scheme
however
dismal
and
atrocious
which
her
father
despair
might
suggest
she
would
not
refuse
to
terminate
her
own
and
her
father
unfortunate
existence
by
poison
or
the
cord
this
confusion
of
mind
could
not
exist
long
it
gradually
gave
place
to
cheerful
prospects
the
evil
perhaps
was
not
without
its
timely
remedy
the
person
whom
she
had
set
out
to
visit
when
her
course
was
diverted
by
craig
she
once
more
resolved
to
apply
to
to
lay
before
him
without
reserve
her
father
situation
to
entreat
pecuniary
succour
and
to
offer
herself
as
a
servant
in
his
family
or
in
that
of
any
of
his
friends
who
stood
in
need
of
one
this
resolution
in
a
slight
degree
consoled
her
but
her
mind
had
been
too
thoroughly
disturbed
to
allow
her
any
sleep
during
that
night
she
equipped
herself
betimes
and
proceeded
with
a
doubting
heart
to
the
house
of
melbourne
she
was
informed
that
he
had
risen
but
was
never
to
be
seen
at
so
early
an
hour
at
nine
he
would
be
disengaged
and
she
would
be
admitted
in
the
present
state
of
her
affairs
this
delay
was
peculiarly
unwelcome
at
breakfast
her
suspense
and
anxieties
would
not
allow
her
to
eat
a
morsel
and
when
the
hour
approached
she
prepared
herself
for
a
new
attempt
as
she
went
out
she
met
at
the
door
a
person
whom
she
recognized
and
whose
office
she
knew
to
be
that
of
a
constable
constantia
had
exercised
in
her
present
narrow
sphere
that
beneficence
which
she
had
formerly
exerted
in
a
larger
there
was
nothing
consistent
with
her
slender
means
that
she
did
not
willingly
perform
for
the
service
of
others
she
had
not
been
sparing
of
consolation
and
personal
aid
in
many
cases
of
personal
distress
that
had
occurred
in
her
neighbourhood
hence
as
far
as
she
was
known
he
was
reverenced
the
wife
of
their
present
visitant
had
experienced
her
succour
and
sympathy
on
occasion
of
the
death
of
a
favourite
child
the
man
notwithstanding
his
office
was
not
of
a
rugged
or
ungrateful
temper
the
task
that
was
now
imposed
upon
him
he
undertook
with
extreme
reluctance
he
was
somewhat
reconciled
to
it
by
the
reflection
that
another
might
not
perform
it
with
that
gentleness
and
lenity
which
he
found
in
himself
a
disposition
to
exercise
on
all
occasions
but
particularly
on
the
present
she
easily
guessed
at
his
business
and
having
greeted
him
with
the
utmost
friendliness
returned
with
him
into
the
house
she
endeavoured
to
remove
the
embarrassment
that
hung
about
him
but
in
vain
having
levied
what
the
law
very
properly
calls
a
distress
he
proceeded
after
much
hesitation
to
inform
dudley
that
he
was
charged
with
a
message
from
a
magistrate
summoning
him
to
come
forthwith
and
account
for
having
a
forged
banknote
in
his
possession
had
given
no
intimation
of
this
the
painful
surprise
that
it
produced
soon
yielded
to
a
just
view
of
this
affair
temporary
inconvenience
and
vexation
was
all
that
could
be
dreaded
from
it
dudley
hated
to
be
seen
or
known
he
usually
walked
out
in
the
dusk
of
evening
but
limited
his
perambulations
to
a
short
space
at
all
other
times
he
was
obstinately
recluse
he
was
easily
persuaded
by
his
daughter
to
allow
her
to
perform
this
unwelcome
office
in
his
stead
he
had
not
received
nor
even
seen
the
note
he
would
have
willingly
spared
her
the
mortification
of
a
judicial
examination
but
he
knew
that
this
was
unavoidable
should
he
comply
with
this
summons
himself
his
daughter
presence
would
be
equally
necessary
influenced
by
these
considerations
he
was
willing
that
his
daughter
should
accompany
the
messenger
who
was
content
that
they
should
consult
their
mutual
convenience
in
this
respect
this
interview
was
to
her
not
without
its
terrors
but
she
cherished
the
hope
that
it
might
ultimately
conduce
to
good
she
did
not
foresee
the
means
by
which
this
would
be
effected
but
her
heart
was
lightened
by
a
secret
and
inexplicable
faith
in
the
propitiousness
of
some
event
that
was
yet
to
occur
this
faith
was
powerfully
enforced
when
she
reached
the
magistrate
door
and
found
that
he
was
no
other
than
melbourne
whose
succour
she
intended
to
solicit
she
was
speedily
ushered
not
into
his
office
but
into
a
private
apartment
where
he
received
her
alone
he
had
been
favourably
prepossessed
with
regard
to
her
character
by
the
report
of
the
officer
who
on
being
charged
with
the
message
had
accounted
for
the
regret
which
he
manifested
by
dwelling
on
the
merits
of
miss
dudley
he
behaved
with
grave
civility
requested
her
to
be
seated
and
accurately
scrutinized
her
appearance
she
found
herself
not
deceived
in
her
preconceptions
of
this
gentleman
character
and
drew
a
favourable
omen
as
to
the
event
of
this
interview
by
what
had
already
taken
place
he
viewed
her
in
silence
for
some
time
and
then
in
a
conciliating
tone
said
it
seems
to
me
madam
as
if
i
had
seen
you
before
your
face
indeed
is
of
that
kind
which
when
once
seen
is
not
easily
forgotten
i
know
it
is
a
long
time
since
but
i
can
not
tell
when
or
where
if
you
will
not
deem
me
impertinent
i
will
venture
to
ask
you
to
assist
my
conjectures
your
name
as
i
am
informed
is
acworth
i
ought
to
have
mentioned
that
dudley
on
his
removal
from
new
york
among
other
expedients
to
obliterate
the
memory
of
his
former
condition
and
conceal
his
poverty
from
the
world
had
made
this
change
in
his
name
that
indeed
said
the
lady
is
the
name
which
my
father
at
present
bears
his
real
name
is
dudley
his
abode
was
formerly
in
queen
street
new
york
your
conjecture
sir
is
not
erroneous
this
is
not
the
first
time
we
have
seen
each
other
i
well
recollect
your
having
been
at
my
father
house
in
the
days
of
his
prosperity
is
it
possible
exclaimed
melbourne
starting
from
his
seat
in
the
first
impulse
of
his
astonishment
are
you
the
daughter
of
my
friend
dudley
by
whom
i
have
so
often
been
hospitably
entertained
i
have
heard
of
his
misfortunes
but
knew
not
that
he
was
alive
or
in
what
part
of
the
world
he
resided
you
are
summoned
on
a
very
disagreeable
affair
but
i
doubt
not
you
will
easily
exculpate
your
father
i
am
told
that
he
is
blind
and
that
his
situation
is
by
no
means
as
comfortable
as
might
be
wished
i
am
grieved
that
he
did
not
confide
in
the
friendship
of
those
that
knew
him
what
could
prompt
him
to
conceal
himself
my
father
has
a
proud
spirit
it
is
not
yet
broken
by
adversity
he
disdains
but
i
must
now
assume
for
his
sake
i
came
hither
this
morning
to
lay
before
you
his
situation
and
to
entreat
your
assistance
to
save
him
from
a
prison
he
can
not
pay
for
the
poor
tenement
he
occupies
and
our
few
goods
are
already
under
distress
he
has
likewise
contracted
a
debt
he
is
i
suppose
already
sued
on
this
account
and
must
go
to
gaol
unless
saved
by
the
interposition
of
some
friend
it
is
true
said
melbourne
i
yesterday
granted
a
warrant
against
him
at
the
suit
of
malcolm
little
did
i
think
that
the
defendant
was
stephen
dudley
but
you
may
dismiss
all
apprehensions
on
that
score
that
affair
shall
be
settled
to
your
father
satisfaction
meanwhile
we
will
if
you
please
despatch
this
unpleasant
business
respecting
a
counterfeit
note
received
in
payment
from
you
by
this
miss
dudley
satisfactorily
explained
that
affair
she
stated
the
relation
in
which
craig
had
formerly
stood
to
her
father
and
the
acts
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
she
slightly
touched
on
the
distresses
which
the
family
had
undergone
during
their
abode
in
this
city
and
the
means
by
which
she
had
been
able
to
preserve
her
father
from
want
she
mentioned
the
circumstances
which
compelled
her
to
seek
his
charity
as
the
last
resource
and
the
casual
encounter
with
craig
by
which
she
was
for
the
present
diverted
from
that
design
she
laid
before
him
a
copy
of
the
letter
she
had
written
and
explained
the
result
in
the
gift
of
the
note
which
now
appeared
to
be
a
counterfeit
she
concluded
with
stating
her
present
views
and
soliciting
him
to
receive
her
into
his
family
in
quality
of
a
servant
or
use
his
interest
with
some
of
his
friends
to
procure
a
provision
of
this
kind
this
tale
was
calculated
deeply
to
affect
a
man
of
melbourne
humanity
no
said
he
i
can
not
listen
to
such
a
request
my
inclination
is
bounded
by
my
means
these
will
not
allow
me
to
place
you
in
an
independent
situation
but
i
will
do
what
i
can
with
your
leave
i
will
introduce
you
to
my
wife
in
your
true
character
her
good
sense
will
teach
her
to
set
a
just
value
on
your
friendship
there
is
no
disgrace
in
earning
your
subsistence
by
your
own
industry
she
and
her
friends
will
furnish
you
with
plenty
of
materials
but
if
there
ever
be
a
deficiency
look
to
them
for
a
supply
constantia
heart
overflowed
at
this
declaration
her
silence
was
more
eloquent
than
any
words
could
have
been
she
declined
an
immediate
introduction
to
his
wife
and
withdrew
but
not
till
her
new
friend
had
forced
her
to
accept
some
money
place
it
to
account
said
he
it
is
merely
paying
you
before
hand
and
discharging
a
debt
at
the
time
when
it
happens
to
be
most
useful
to
the
creditor
to
what
entire
and
incredible
reverses
is
the
tenor
of
human
life
subject
a
short
minute
shall
effect
a
transition
from
a
state
utterly
destitute
of
hope
to
a
condition
where
all
is
serene
and
abundant
the
path
which
we
employ
all
our
exertions
to
shun
is
often
found
upon
trial
to
be
the
true
road
to
prosperity
constantia
retired
from
this
interview
with
a
heart
bounding
with
exultation
she
related
to
her
father
all
that
had
happened
he
was
pleased
on
her
account
but
the
detection
of
his
poverty
by
melbourne
was
the
parent
of
new
mortification
his
only
remaining
hope
relative
to
himself
was
that
he
should
die
in
his
obscurity
whereas
it
was
probable
that
his
old
acquaintance
would
trace
him
to
his
covert
this
prognostic
filled
him
with
the
deepest
inquietude
and
all
the
reasonings
of
his
daughter
were
insufficient
to
appease
him
melbourne
made
his
appearance
in
the
afternoon
he
was
introduced
by
constantia
to
her
father
dudley
figure
was
emaciated
and
his
features
corroded
by
his
ceaseless
melancholy
his
blindness
produced
in
them
a
woeful
and
wildering
expression
his
dress
betokened
his
penury
and
was
in
unison
with
the
meanness
of
his
habitation
and
furniture
the
visitant
was
struck
with
the
melancholy
contrast
which
these
appearances
exhibited
to
the
joyousness
and
splendour
that
he
had
formerly
witnessed
dudley
received
the
salutations
of
his
guest
with
an
air
of
embarrassment
and
dejection
he
resigned
to
his
daughter
the
task
of
sustaining
the
conversation
and
excused
himself
from
complying
with
the
urgent
invitations
of
melbourne
while
at
the
same
time
he
studiously
forebore
all
expressions
tending
to
encourage
any
kind
of
intercourse
between
them
the
guest
came
with
a
message
from
his
wife
who
entreated
miss
company
to
tea
with
her
that
evening
adding
that
she
should
be
entirely
alone
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
compliance
with
this
request
she
cheerfully
assented
and
in
the
evening
was
introduced
to
melbourne
by
her
husband
constantia
found
in
this
lady
nothing
that
called
for
reverence
or
admiration
though
she
could
not
deny
her
some
portion
of
esteem
the
impression
which
her
own
appearance
and
conversation
made
upon
her
entertainer
was
much
more
powerful
and
favourable
a
consciousness
of
her
own
worth
and
disdain
of
the
malevolence
of
fortune
perpetually
shone
forth
in
her
behaviour
it
was
modelled
by
a
sort
of
mean
between
presumption
on
the
one
hand
and
humility
on
the
other
she
claimed
no
more
than
what
was
justly
due
to
her
but
she
claimed
no
less
she
did
not
soothe
our
vanity
nor
fascinate
our
pity
by
diffident
reserves
and
fluttering
neither
did
she
disgust
by
arrogant
negligence
and
uncircumspect
loquacity
at
parting
she
received
commissions
in
the
way
of
her
profession
which
supplied
her
with
abundant
and
profitable
employment
she
abridged
her
visit
on
her
father
account
and
parted
from
her
new
friend
just
early
enough
to
avoid
meeting
with
ormond
who
entered
the
house
a
few
minutes
after
she
had
left
it
what
pity
said
melbourne
to
him
you
did
not
come
a
little
sooner
you
pretend
to
be
a
judge
of
beauty
i
should
like
to
have
heard
your
opinion
of
a
face
that
has
just
left
us
describe
it
said
the
other
that
is
beyond
my
capacity
complexion
and
hair
and
eyebrows
may
be
painted
but
these
are
of
no
great
value
in
the
present
case
it
is
in
the
putting
them
together
that
nature
has
here
shown
her
skill
and
not
in
the
structure
of
each
of
the
parts
individually
considered
perhaps
you
may
at
some
time
meet
each
other
here
if
a
lofty
fellow
like
you
now
would
mix
a
little
common
sense
with
his
science
this
girl
might
hope
for
a
husband
and
her
father
for
a
natural
protector
are
they
ill
search
of
one
or
the
other
i
can
not
say
they
are
nay
i
imagine
they
would
hear
any
imputation
with
more
patience
than
that
but
certain
i
am
they
stand
in
need
of
them
how
much
would
it
be
to
the
honour
of
a
man
like
you
rioting
in
wealth
to
divide
it
with
one
lovely
and
accomplished
as
this
girl
is
and
struggling
with
indigence
melbourne
then
related
the
adventure
of
the
morning
it
was
easy
for
ormond
to
perceive
that
this
was
the
same
person
of
whom
he
already
had
some
knowledge
but
there
were
some
particulars
in
the
narrative
that
excited
surprise
a
note
had
been
received
from
craig
at
the
first
visit
in
the
evening
and
this
note
was
for
no
more
than
fifty
dollars
this
did
not
exactly
tally
with
the
information
received
from
craig
but
this
note
was
forged
might
not
this
girl
mix
a
little
imposture
with
her
truth
who
knows
her
temptations
to
hypocrisy
it
might
have
been
a
present
from
another
quarter
and
accompanied
with
no
very
honourable
conditions
exquisite
wretch
those
whom
honesty
will
not
let
live
must
be
knaves
such
is
the
alternative
offered
by
the
wisdom
of
society
he
listened
to
the
tale
with
apparent
indifference
he
speedily
shifted
the
conversation
to
new
topics
and
put
an
end
to
his
visit
sooner
than
ordinary
chapter
ii
i
know
no
task
more
arduous
than
a
just
delineation
of
the
character
of
ormond
to
scrutinize
and
ascertain
our
own
principles
is
abundantly
difficult
to
exhibit
these
principles
to
the
world
with
absolute
sincerity
can
hardly
be
expected
we
are
prompted
to
conceal
and
to
feign
by
a
thousand
motives
but
truly
to
portray
the
motives
and
relate
the
actions
of
another
appears
utterly
impossible
the
attempt
however
if
made
with
fidelity
and
diligence
is
not
without
its
use
to
comprehend
the
whole
truth
with
regard
to
the
character
and
conduct
of
another
may
be
denied
to
any
human
being
but
different
observers
will
have
in
their
pictures
a
greater
or
less
portion
of
this
truth
no
representation
will
be
wholly
false
and
some
though
not
perfectly
may
yet
be
considerably
exempt
from
error
ormond
was
of
all
mankind
the
being
most
difficult
and
most
deserving
to
be
studied
a
fortunate
concurrence
of
incidents
has
unveiled
his
actions
to
me
with
more
distinctness
than
to
any
other
my
knowledge
is
far
from
being
absolute
but
i
am
conscious
of
a
kind
of
duty
first
to
my
friend
and
secondly
to
mankind
to
impart
the
knowledge
i
possess
i
shall
omit
to
mention
the
means
by
which
i
became
acquainted
with
his
character
nor
shall
i
enter
at
this
time
into
every
part
of
it
his
political
projects
are
likely
to
possess
an
extensive
influence
on
the
future
condition
of
this
western
world
i
do
not
conceive
myself
authorized
to
communicate
a
knowledge
of
his
schemes
which
i
gained
in
some
sort
surreptitiously
or
at
least
by
means
of
which
he
was
not
apprised
i
shall
merely
explain
the
maxims
by
which
he
was
accustomed
to
regulate
his
private
deportment
no
one
could
entertain
loftier
conceptions
of
human
capacity
than
ormond
but
he
carefully
distinguished
between
men
in
the
abstract
and
men
as
they
are
the
former
were
beings
to
be
impelled
by
the
breath
of
accident
in
a
right
or
a
wrong
road
but
whatever
direction
they
should
receive
it
was
the
property
of
their
nature
to
persist
in
it
now
this
impulse
had
been
given
no
single
being
could
rectify
the
error
it
was
the
business
of
the
wise
man
to
form
a
just
estimate
of
things
but
not
to
attempt
by
individual
efforts
so
chimerical
an
enterprise
as
that
of
promoting
the
happiness
of
mankind
their
condition
was
out
of
the
reach
of
a
member
of
a
corrupt
society
to
control
a
mortal
poison
pervaded
the
whole
system
by
means
of
which
every
thing
received
was
converted
into
bane
and
purulence
efforts
designed
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
an
individual
were
sure
of
answering
a
contrary
purpose
the
principles
of
the
social
machine
must
be
rectified
before
men
can
be
beneficially
active
our
motives
may
be
neutral
or
beneficent
but
our
actions
tend
merely
to
the
production
of
evil
the
idea
of
total
forbearance
was
not
less
delusive
man
could
not
be
otherwise
than
a
cause
of
perpetual
operation
and
efficacy
he
was
part
of
a
machine
and
as
such
had
not
power
to
withhold
his
agency
contiguousness
to
other
parts
that
is
to
other
men
was
all
that
was
necessary
to
render
him
a
powerful
concurrent
what
then
was
the
conduct
incumbent
on
him
whether
he
went
forward
or
stood
still
whether
his
motives
were
malignant
or
kind
or
indifferent
the
mass
of
evil
was
equally
and
necessarily
augmented
it
did
not
follow
from
these
preliminaries
that
virtue
and
duty
were
terms
without
a
meaning
but
they
require
us
to
promote
our
own
happiness
and
not
the
happiness
of
others
not
because
the
former
end
is
intrinsically
preferable
not
because
the
happiness
of
others
is
unworthy
of
primary
consideration
but
because
it
is
not
to
be
attained
our
power
in
the
present
state
of
things
is
subjected
to
certain
limits
a
man
may
reasonably
hope
to
accomplish
his
end
when
he
proposes
nothing
but
his
own
good
any
other
point
is
inaccessible
he
must
not
part
with
benevolent
desire
this
is
a
constituent
of
happiness
he
sees
the
value
of
general
and
particular
felicity
he
sometimes
paints
it
to
his
fancy
but
if
this
be
rarely
done
it
is
in
consequence
of
virtuous
sensibility
which
is
afflicted
on
observing
that
his
pictures
are
reversed
in
the
real
state
of
mankind
a
wise
man
will
relinquish
the
pursuit
of
general
benefit
but
not
the
desire
of
that
benefit
or
the
perception
of
that
in
which
this
benefit
consists
because
these
are
among
the
ingredients
of
virtue
and
the
sources
of
his
happiness
principles
in
the
looser
sense
of
that
term
have
little
influence
on
practice
ormond
was
for
the
most
part
governed
like
others
by
the
influences
of
education
and
present
circumstances
it
required
a
vigilant
discernment
to
distinguish
whether
the
stream
of
his
actions
flowed
from
one
or
the
other
his
income
was
large
and
he
managed
it
nearly
on
the
same
principles
as
other
men
he
thought
himself
entitled
to
all
the
splendour
and
ease
which
it
would
purchase
but
his
taste
was
elaborate
and
correct
he
gratified
his
love
of
the
beautiful
because
the
sensations
it
afforded
were
pleasing
but
made
no
sacrifices
to
the
love
of
distinction
he
gave
no
expensive
entertainments
for
the
sake
of
exciting
the
admiration
of
stupid
gazers
or
the
flattery
or
envy
of
those
who
shared
them
pompous
equipage
and
retinue
were
modes
of
appropriating
the
esteem
of
mankind
which
he
held
in
profound
contempt
the
garb
of
his
attendants
was
fashioned
after
the
model
suggested
by
his
imagination
and
not
in
compliance
with
the
dictates
of
custom
he
treated
with
systematic
negligence
the
etiquette
that
regulates
the
intercourse
of
persons
of
a
certain
class
he
every
where
acted
in
this
respect
as
if
he
were
alone
or
among
familiar
associates
the
very
appellations
of
sir
and
madam
and
mister
were
in
his
apprehension
servile
and
ridiculous
and
as
custom
or
law
had
annexed
no
penalty
to
the
neglect
of
these
he
conformed
to
his
own
opinions
it
was
easier
for
him
to
reduce
his
notions
of
equality
to
practice
than
for
most
others
to
level
himself
with
others
was
an
act
of
condescension
and
not
of
arrogance
it
was
of
requisite
to
descend
rather
than
to
risk
a
task
the
most
easy
if
we
regard
the
obstacle
flowing
from
the
prejudice
of
mankind
but
far
most
difficult
if
the
motive
of
the
agent
be
considered
that
in
which
he
chiefly
placed
his
boast
was
his
sincerity
to
this
he
refused
no
sacrifice
in
consequence
of
this
his
deportment
was
disgusting
to
weak
minds
by
a
certain
air
of
ferocity
and
haughty
negligence
he
was
without
the
attractions
of
candour
because
he
regarded
not
the
happiness
of
others
but
in
subservience
to
his
sincerity
hence
it
was
natural
to
suppose
that
the
character
of
this
man
was
easily
understood
he
affected
to
conceal
nothing
no
one
appeared
more
exempt
from
the
instigations
of
vanity
he
set
light
by
the
good
opinions
of
others
had
no
compassion
for
their
prejudices
and
hazarded
assertions
in
their
presence
which
he
knew
would
be
in
the
highest
degree
shocking
to
their
previous
notions
they
might
take
it
he
would
say
as
they
list
such
were
his
conceptions
and
the
last
thing
he
would
give
up
was
the
use
of
his
tongue
it
was
his
way
to
give
utterance
to
the
suggestions
of
his
understanding
if
they
were
disadvantageous
to
him
the
opinions
of
others
it
was
well
he
did
not
want
to
be
regarded
in
any
light
but
the
true
one
he
was
contented
to
be
rated
by
the
world
at
his
just
value
if
they
esteemed
him
for
qualities
which
he
did
not
possess
was
he
wrong
in
rectifying
their
mistake
but
in
reality
if
they
valued
him
for
that
to
which
he
had
no
claim
and
which
he
himself
considered
as
contemptible
he
must
naturally
desire
to
show
them
their
error
and
forfeit
that
praise
which
in
his
own
opinion
was
a
badge
of
infamy
in
listening
to
his
discourse
no
one
claim
to
sincerity
appeared
less
questionable
a
somewhat
different
conclusion
would
be
suggested
by
a
survey
of
his
actions
in
early
youth
he
discovered
in
himself
a
remarkable
facility
in
imitating
the
voice
and
gestures
of
others
his
memory
was
eloquently
retentive
and
these
qualities
would
have
rendered
his
career
in
the
theatrical
profession
illustrious
had
not
his
condition
raised
him
above
it
his
talents
were
occasionally
exerted
for
the
entertainment
of
convivial
parties
and
private
circles
but
he
gradually
withdrew
from
such
scenes
as
he
advanced
in
age
and
devoted
his
abilities
to
higher
purposes
his
aversion
to
duplicity
had
flowed
from
experience
of
its
evils
he
had
frequently
been
made
its
victim
inconsequence
of
this
his
temper
had
become
suspicious
and
he
was
apt
to
impute
deceit
on
occasions
when
others
of
no
inconsiderable
sagacity
were
abundantly
disposed
to
confidence
one
transaction
had
occurred
in
his
life
in
which
the
consequences
of
being
misled
by
false
appearances
were
of
the
utmost
moment
to
his
honour
and
safety
the
usual
mode
of
salving
his
doubt
he
deeded
insufficient
and
the
eagerness
of
his
curiosity
tempted
him
for
the
first
time
to
employ
for
this
end
his
talent
at
imitation
he
therefore
assumed
a
borrowed
character
and
guise
and
performed
his
part
with
so
much
skill
as
fully
to
accomplish
life
design
he
whose
mask
would
have
secured
him
from
all
other
attempts
was
thus
taken
through
an
avenue
which
his
caution
had
overlooked
and
the
hypocrisy
of
his
pretensions
unquestionably
ascertained
perhaps
in
a
comprehensive
view
the
success
of
this
expedient
was
unfortunate
it
served
to
recommend
this
method
of
encountering
deceit
and
informed
him
of
the
extent
of
those
powers
which
are
so
liable
to
be
abused
a
subtlety
much
inferior
to
ormond
would
suffice
to
recommend
this
mode
of
action
it
was
defensible
on
no
other
principle
than
necessity
the
treachery
of
mankind
compelled
him
to
resort
to
it
if
they
should
deal
in
a
manner
as
upright
and
explicit
as
himself
it
would
be
superfluous
but
since
they
were
in
the
perpetual
use
of
stratagems
and
artifices
it
was
allowable
he
thought
to
wield
the
same
arms
it
was
easy
to
perceive
however
that
this
practice
was
recommended
to
him
by
other
considerations
he
was
delighted
with
the
power
it
conferred
it
enabled
him
to
gain
access
as
if
by
supernatural
means
to
the
privacy
of
others
and
baffle
their
profoundest
contrivances
to
hide
themselves
from
his
view
it
flattered
him
with
the
possession
of
something
like
omniscience
it
was
besides
an
art
in
which
as
in
others
every
accession
of
skill
was
a
source
of
new
gratification
compared
with
this
the
performance
of
the
actor
is
the
sport
of
children
this
profession
he
was
accustomed
to
treat
with
merciless
ridicule
and
no
doubt
some
of
his
contempt
arose
from
a
secret
comparison
between
the
theatrical
species
of
imitation
and
his
own
he
blended
in
his
own
person
the
functions
of
poet
and
actor
and
his
dramas
were
not
fictitious
but
real
the
end
that
he
proposed
was
not
the
amusement
of
a
playhouse
mob
his
were
scenes
in
which
hope
and
fear
exercised
a
genuine
influence
and
in
which
was
maintained
that
resemblance
to
truth
so
audaciously
and
grossly
violated
on
the
stage
it
is
obvious
how
many
singular
conjunctures
must
have
grown
out
of
this
propensity
a
mind
of
uncommon
energy
like
ormond
which
had
occupied
a
wide
sphere
of
action
and
which
could
not
fail
of
confederating
its
efforts
with
those
of
minds
like
itself
must
have
given
birth
to
innumerable
incidents
not
unworthy
to
be
exhibited
by
the
most
eloquent
historian
it
is
not
my
business
to
relate
any
of
these
the
fate
of
miss
dudley
is
intimately
connected
with
him
what
influence
he
obtained
over
her
destiny
in
consequence
of
this
dexterity
will
appear
in
the
sequel
it
arose
from
these
circumstances
that
no
one
was
more
impenetrable
than
ormond
though
no
one
real
character
seemed
more
easily
discerned
the
projects
that
occupied
his
attention
were
diffused
over
an
ample
space
and
his
instruments
and
coadjutors
were
culled
from
a
field
whose
bounds
were
those
of
the
civilized
world
to
the
vulgar
eye
therefore
he
appeared
a
man
of
speculation
and
seclusion
and
was
equally
inscrutable
in
his
real
and
assumed
characters
in
his
real
his
intents
were
too
lofty
and
comprehensive
as
well
as
too
assiduously
shrouded
from
profane
inspection
for
them
to
scan
in
the
latter
appearances
were
merely
calculated
to
mislead
and
not
to
enlighten
in
his
youth
he
had
been
guilty
of
the
usual
excesses
incident
to
his
age
and
character
these
had
disappeared
and
yielded
place
to
a
more
regular
and
circumspect
system
of
action
in
the
choice
of
his
pleasures
he
still
exposed
himself
to
the
censure
of
the
world
yet
there
was
more
of
grossness
and
licentiousness
in
the
expression
of
his
tenets
than
in
the
tenets
themselves
so
far
as
temporance
regards
the
maintenance
of
health
no
man
adhered
to
its
precepts
with
more
fidelity
but
he
esteemed
some
species
of
connection
with
the
other
sex
as
venial
which
mankind
in
general
are
vehement
in
condemning
in
his
intercourse
with
women
he
deemed
himself
superior
to
the
allurements
of
what
is
called
love
his
inferences
were
drawn
from
a
consideration
of
the
physical
propensities
of
a
human
being
in
his
scale
of
enjoyments
the
gratifications
which
belonged
to
these
were
placed
at
the
bottom
yet
he
did
not
entirely
disdain
them
and
when
they
could
be
purchased
without
the
sacrifice
of
superior
advantages
they
were
sufficiently
acceptable
his
mistake
on
this
head
was
the
result
of
his
ignorance
he
had
not
hitherto
met
with
a
female
worthy
of
his
confidence
their
views
were
limited
and
superficial
or
their
understandings
were
betrayed
by
the
tenderness
of
their
hearts
he
found
in
them
no
intellectual
energy
no
superiority
to
what
he
accounted
vulgar
prejudice
and
no
affinity
with
the
sentiments
which
he
cherished
with
most
devotion
their
presence
had
been
capable
of
exciting
no
emotion
which
he
did
not
quickly
discover
to
be
vague
and
sensual
and
the
uniformity
of
his
experience
at
length
instilled
into
him
a
belief
that
the
intellectual
constitution
of
females
was
essentially
defective
he
denied
the
reality
of
that
passion
which
claimed
a
similitude
or
sympathy
of
minds
as
one
of
its
ingredients
chapter
iii
he
resided
in
new
york
some
time
before
he
took
up
his
abode
in
philadelphia
he
had
some
pecuniary
concerns
with
a
merchant
of
that
place
he
occasionally
frequented
his
house
finding
in
the
society
which
it
afforded
him
scope
for
amusing
speculation
and
opportunities
of
gaining
a
species
of
knowledge
of
which
at
that
time
he
stood
in
need
there
was
one
daughter
of
the
family
who
of
course
constituted
a
member
of
the
domestic
circle
helena
cleves
was
endowed
with
every
feminine
and
fascinating
quality
her
features
were
modified
by
the
most
transient
sentiments
and
were
the
seat
of
a
softness
at
all
times
blushful
and
bewitching
all
those
graces
of
symmetry
smoothness
and
lustre
which
assemble
in
the
imagination
of
the
painter
when
he
calls
from
the
bosom
of
her
natal
deep
the
paphian
divinity
blended
their
perfections
in
the
shape
complexion
and
hair
of
this
lady
her
voice
was
naturally
thrilling
and
melodious
and
her
utterance
clear
and
distinct
a
musical
education
had
added
to
all
these
advantages
the
improvements
of
art
and
no
one
could
swim
in
the
dance
with
such
airy
and
transporting
elegance
it
is
obvious
to
inquire
whether
her
mental
were
in
any
degree
on
a
level
with
her
exterior
accomplishments
should
you
listen
to
her
talk
you
would
be
liable
to
be
deceived
in
this
respect
her
utterance
was
so
just
her
phrases
so
happy
and
her
language
so
copious
and
correct
that
the
hearer
was
apt
to
be
impressed
with
an
ardent
veneration
of
her
abilities
but
the
truth
is
she
was
calculated
to
excite
emotions
more
voluptuous
than
dignified
her
presence
produced
a
trance
of
the
senses
rather
than
an
illumination
of
the
soul
it
was
a
topic
of
wonder
how
she
should
have
so
carefully
separated
the
husk
from
the
kernel
and
he
so
absolute
a
mistress
of
the
vehicle
of
knowledge
with
so
slender
means
of
supplying
it
yet
it
is
difficult
to
judge
but
from
comparison
to
say
that
helena
cleves
was
silly
or
ignorant
would
be
hatefully
unjust
her
understanding
bore
no
disadvantageous
comparison
with
that
of
the
majority
of
her
sex
but
when
placed
in
competition
with
that
of
some
eminent
females
or
of
ormond
it
was
exposed
to
the
risk
of
contempt
this
lady
and
ormond
were
exposed
to
mutual
examination
the
latter
was
not
unaffected
by
the
radiance
that
environed
this
girl
but
her
true
character
was
easily
discovered
and
he
was
accustomed
to
regard
her
merely
as
an
object
charming
to
the
senses
his
attention
to
her
was
dictated
by
this
principle
when
she
sung
or
talked
it
was
not
unworthy
of
the
strongest
mind
to
be
captivated
with
her
music
and
her
elocution
but
these
were
the
limits
which
he
set
to
his
gratifications
that
sensations
of
a
different
kind
never
ruffled
his
tranquillity
must
not
be
supposed
but
he
too
accurately
estimated
their
consequences
to
permit
himself
to
indulge
them
unhappily
the
lady
did
not
exercise
equal
fortitude
during
a
certain
interval
ormond
visits
were
frequent
and
the
insensibly
contracted
for
him
somewhat
more
than
reverence
the
tenor
of
his
discourse
was
little
adapted
to
cherish
her
hopes
in
the
declaration
of
his
opinions
he
was
never
withheld
by
scruples
of
decorum
or
a
selfish
regard
to
his
own
interest
his
matrimonial
tenets
were
harsh
and
repulsive
a
woman
of
keener
penetration
would
have
predicted
from
them
the
disappointment
of
her
wishes
but
helena
mind
was
uninured
to
the
discussion
of
logical
points
and
the
tracing
of
remote
consequences
his
presence
inspired
feelings
which
would
not
permit
her
to
bestow
an
impartial
attention
on
his
arguments
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
his
reasonings
failed
to
convince
her
the
combined
influence
of
passion
and
an
unenlightened
understanding
hindered
her
from
fully
comprehending
them
all
she
gathered
was
a
vague
conception
of
something
magnificent
and
vast
in
his
character
helena
was
destined
to
experience
the
vicissitudes
of
fortune
her
father
died
suddenly
and
left
her
without
provision
she
was
compelled
to
accept
the
invitations
of
a
kinswoman
and
live
in
some
sort
a
life
of
dependence
she
was
not
qualified
to
sustain
this
reverse
of
fortune
in
a
graceful
manner
she
could
not
bear
the
diminution
of
her
customary
indulgences
and
to
these
privations
were
added
the
inquietudes
of
a
passion
which
now
began
to
look
with
an
aspect
of
hopelessness
these
events
happened
in
the
absence
of
ormond
on
his
return
he
made
himself
acquainted
with
them
he
saw
the
extent
of
this
misfortune
to
a
woman
of
helena
character
but
knew
not
in
what
manner
it
might
be
effectually
obviated
he
esteemed
it
incumbent
on
him
to
pay
her
a
visit
in
her
new
abode
this
token
at
least
of
respect
or
remembrance
his
duty
appeared
to
prescribe
this
visit
was
unexpected
by
the
lady
surprise
is
the
enemy
of
concealment
she
was
oppressed
with
a
sense
of
her
desolate
situation
she
was
sitting
in
her
own
apartment
in
a
museful
posture
her
fancy
was
occupied
with
the
image
of
ormond
and
her
tears
were
flowing
at
the
thought
of
their
eternal
separation
when
he
entered
softly
and
unperceived
by
her
a
tap
upon
the
shoulder
was
the
first
signal
of
his
presence
so
critical
an
interview
could
not
fail
of
unveiling
the
true
state
of
the
lady
heart
ormond
suspicions
were
excited
and
these
suspicions
speedily
led
to
an
explanation
ormond
retired
to
ruminate
on
this
discovery
i
have
already
mentioned
his
sentiments
respecting
love
his
feelings
relative
to
helena
did
not
contradict
his
principles
yet
the
image
which
had
formerly
been
exquisite
in
loveliness
had
now
suddenly
gained
unspeakable
attractions
this
discovery
had
set
the
question
in
a
new
light
it
was
of
sufficient
importance
to
make
him
deliberate
he
reasoned
somewhat
in
the
following
manner
marriage
is
absurd
this
flows
from
the
general
and
incurable
imperfection
of
the
female
character
no
woman
can
possess
that
worth
which
would
induce
me
to
enter
into
this
contract
and
bind
myself
without
power
of
revoking
the
decree
to
her
society
this
opinion
may
possibly
be
erroneous
but
it
is
undoubtedly
true
with
respect
to
helena
and
the
uncertainty
of
the
position
in
general
will
increase
the
necessity
of
caution
in
the
present
case
that
woman
may
exist
whom
i
should
not
fear
to
espouse
this
is
not
her
some
accident
may
cause
our
meeting
shall
i
then
disable
myself
by
an
irrevocable
obligation
from
profiting
by
so
auspicious
an
occurrence
this
girl
society
was
to
be
enjoyed
in
one
of
two
ways
should
he
consult
his
inclination
there
was
little
room
for
doubt
he
had
never
met
with
one
more
highly
qualified
for
that
species
of
intercourse
which
he
esteemed
rational
no
man
more
abhorred
the
votaries
of
licentiousness
nothing
was
more
detectable
to
him
than
a
mercenary
alliance
personal
fidelity
and
the
existence
of
that
passion
of
which
he
had
in
the
present
case
the
good
fortune
to
be
the
object
were
indispensable
in
his
scheme
the
union
was
indebted
for
its
value
on
the
voluntariness
with
which
it
was
formed
and
the
entire
acquiescence
of
the
judgement
of
both
parties
in
its
rectitude
dissimulation
and
artifice
were
wholly
foreign
to
the
success
of
his
project
if
the
lady
thought
proper
to
assent
to
his
proposal
it
was
well
she
did
so
because
assent
was
more
eligible
than
refusal
she
would
no
doubt
prefer
marriage
she
would
deem
it
more
conducive
to
happiness
this
was
an
error
this
was
an
opinion
his
reasons
for
which
he
was
at
liberty
to
state
to
her
at
least
it
was
justifiable
in
refusing
to
subject
himself
to
loathsome
and
impracticable
obligations
certain
inconveniences
attended
women
who
set
aside
on
these
occasions
the
sanction
of
law
but
these
were
imaginary
they
owed
their
force
to
the
errors
of
the
sufferer
to
annihilate
them
it
was
only
necessary
to
reason
justly
but
allowing
these
inconveniences
their
full
weight
and
an
indestructible
existence
it
was
but
a
choice
of
evils
were
they
worse
in
this
lady
apprehension
than
an
eternal
and
hopeless
separation
perhaps
they
were
if
so
she
would
make
her
election
accordingly
he
did
nothing
but
lay
the
conditions
before
her
if
his
scheme
should
obtain
the
concurrence
of
her
unbiased
judgement
he
should
rejoice
if
not
her
conduct
should
be
influenced
by
him
whatever
way
she
should
decide
he
would
assist
her
in
adhering
to
her
decision
but
would
meanwhile
furnish
her
with
the
materials
of
a
right
decision
this
determination
was
singular
many
will
regard
it
as
incredible
no
man
it
will
be
thought
can
put
this
deception
on
himself
and
imagine
that
there
was
genuine
beneficence
in
a
scheme
like
this
would
the
lady
more
consult
her
happiness
by
adopting
than
by
rejecting
it
there
can
be
but
one
answer
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
ormond
in
stating
this
proposal
acted
with
all
the
impartiality
that
he
pretended
that
he
did
not
employ
fallacious
exaggerations
and
ambiguous
expedients
that
he
did
not
seize
every
opportunity
of
triumphing
over
her
weakness
and
building
his
success
rather
on
the
illusions
of
her
heart
than
the
convictions
of
her
understanding
his
conclusions
were
specious
but
delusive
and
were
not
uninfluenced
by
improper
biases
but
of
this
he
himself
was
scarcely
conscious
and
it
must
be
at
least
admitted
that
he
acted
with
scrupulous
sincerity
an
uncommon
degree
of
skill
was
required
to
introduce
this
topic
so
as
to
avoid
the
imputation
of
an
insult
this
scheme
was
little
in
unison
with
all
her
preconceived
notions
no
doubt
the
irksomeness
of
her
present
situation
the
allurements
of
luxury
and
ease
which
ormond
had
to
bestow
and
the
revival
of
her
ancient
independence
and
security
had
some
share
in
dictating
her
assent
her
concurrence
was
by
no
means
cordial
and
unhesitating
remorse
and
the
sense
of
dishonour
pursued
her
to
her
retreat
though
chosen
with
a
view
of
shunning
their
intrusions
and
it
was
only
when
the
reasonings
and
blandishments
of
her
lover
were
exhibited
that
she
was
lulled
into
temporary
tranquillity
she
removed
to
philadelphia
here
she
enjoyed
all
the
consolations
of
opulence
she
was
mistress
of
a
small
but
elegant
mansion
she
possessed
all
the
means
of
solitary
amusement
and
frequently
enjoyed
the
company
of
ormond
these
however
were
insufficient
to
render
her
happy
certain
reflections
might
for
a
time
be
repressed
as
divested
of
their
sting
but
they
insinuated
themselves
at
every
interval
and
imparted
to
her
mind
a
hue
of
rejection
from
which
she
could
not
entirely
relieve
herself
she
endeavoured
to
acquire
a
relish
for
the
pursuits
of
literature
by
which
her
lonely
hours
might
be
cheered
but
of
this
even
in
the
blithsomeness
and
serenity
of
her
former
days
she
was
incapable
much
more
so
now
when
she
was
the
prey
of
perpetual
inquietude
ormond
perceived
this
change
not
without
uneasiness
all
his
efforts
to
reconcile
her
to
her
present
situation
were
fruitless
they
produced
a
momentary
effect
upon
her
the
softness
of
her
temper
and
her
attachment
to
him
would
at
his
bidding
restore
her
to
vivacity
and
ease
but
the
illumination
seldom
endured
longer
than
his
presence
and
the
novelty
of
some
amusement
with
which
he
had
furnished
her
at
his
next
visit
perhaps
he
would
find
that
a
new
task
awaited
him
she
indulged
herself
in
no
recriminations
or
invectives
she
could
not
complain
that
her
lover
had
deceived
her
she
had
voluntarily
and
deliberately
accepted
the
conditions
prescribed
she
regarded
her
own
disposition
to
repine
as
a
species
of
injustice
she
laid
no
claim
to
an
increase
of
tenderness
she
hinted
not
a
wish
for
a
change
of
situation
yet
she
was
unhappy
tears
stole
into
her
eyes
and
her
thoughts
wandered
into
gloomy
reverie
at
moments
when
least
aware
of
their
reproach
and
least
willing
to
indulge
them
was
a
change
to
be
desired
yes
provided
that
change
was
equally
agreeable
to
ormond
and
should
be
seriously
proposed
by
him
of
this
she
had
no
hope
as
long
as
his
accents
rung
in
her
ears
she
even
doubted
whether
it
were
to
be
wished
at
any
rate
it
was
impossible
to
gain
his
approbation
to
it
her
destiny
was
fixed
it
was
better
than
the
cessation
of
all
intercourse
yet
her
heart
was
a
stranger
to
all
permanent
tranquillity
her
manners
were
artless
and
ingenuous
in
company
with
ormond
her
heart
was
perfectly
unveiled
he
was
her
divinity
to
whom
every
sentiment
was
visible
and
to
whom
she
spontaneously
uttered
what
she
thought
because
the
employment
was
pleasing
because
he
listened
with
apparent
satisfaction
and
because
in
fine
it
was
the
same
thing
to
speak
and
to
think
in
his
presence
there
was
no
inducement
to
conceal
from
him
the
most
evanescent
and
fugitive
ideas
ormond
was
not
an
inattentive
or
indifferent
spectator
of
those
appearances
his
friend
was
unhappy
she
shrunk
aghast
from
her
own
reproaches
and
the
censure
of
the
world
this
morbid
sensibility
he
had
endeavoured
to
cure
but
hitherto
in
vain
what
was
the
amount
of
her
unhappiness
her
spirits
had
formerly
been
gay
but
her
gaiety
was
capable
of
yielding
place
to
and
solemn
tenderness
after
sedateness
was
at
those
times
the
offspring
not
of
reflection
but
of
passion
there
still
remained
much
of
her
former
self
he
was
seldom
permitted
to
witness
more
than
the
traces
of
sorrow
in
answer
to
his
inquiries
she
for
the
most
part
described
sensations
that
were
gone
and
which
she
flattered
herself
and
him
would
never
return
but
this
hope
was
always
doomed
to
disappointment
solitude
infallibly
conjured
up
the
ghost
which
had
been
laid
and
it
was
plain
that
argument
was
no
adequate
remedy
for
this
disease
how
far
would
time
alleviate
its
evils
when
the
novelty
of
her
condition
should
disappear
would
she
not
regard
it
with
other
eyes
by
being
familiar
with
contempt
it
will
lose
its
sting
but
is
that
to
be
wished
must
not
the
character
be
thoroughly
depraved
before
the
scorn
of
our
neighbours
shall
become
indifferent
indifference
flowing
from
a
sense
of
justice
and
a
persuasion
that
our
treatment
is
unmerited
is
characteristic
of
the
noblest
minds
but
indifference
to
obloquy
because
we
are
habituated
to
it
is
a
token
of
peculiar
baseness
this
therefore
was
a
remedy
to
be
ardently
deprecated
he
had
egregiously
overrated
the
influence
of
truth
and
his
own
influence
he
had
hoped
that
his
victory
was
permanent
in
order
to
the
success
of
truth
he
was
apt
to
imagine
that
nothing
was
needful
but
opportunities
for
a
complete
exhibition
of
it
they
that
inquire
and
reason
with
sufficient
deliberateness
and
caution
must
inevitably
accomplish
their
end
these
maxims
were
confuted
in
the
present
case
he
had
formed
no
advantageous
conceptions
of
helena
capacity
his
aversion
to
matrimony
arose
from
those
conceptions
but
experience
had
shown
him
that
his
conclusions
unfavourable
as
they
were
had
fallen
short
of
the
truth
convictions
which
he
had
conceived
her
mind
to
be
sufficiently
strong
to
receive
and
retain
were
proved
to
have
made
no
other
than
a
momentary
impression
hence
his
objections
to
ally
himself
to
a
mind
inferior
to
his
own
were
strengthened
rather
than
diminished
but
he
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
being
instrumental
to
her
misery
marriage
was
an
efficacious
remedy
but
he
could
not
as
yet
bring
himself
to
regard
the
aptitude
of
this
cure
as
a
subject
of
doubt
the
idea
of
separation
sometimes
occurred
to
him
he
was
not
unapprehensive
of
the
influence
of
time
and
absence
in
curing
the
most
vehement
passion
but
to
this
expedient
the
lady
could
not
be
reconciled
he
knew
her
too
well
to
believe
that
she
would
willingly
adopt
it
but
the
only
obstacle
to
this
scheme
did
not
flow
from
the
lady
opposition
he
would
probably
have
found
upon
experiment
as
strong
an
aversion
to
adopt
it
in
himself
as
in
her
it
was
easy
to
see
the
motives
by
which
he
would
be
likely
to
be
swayed
into
a
change
of
principles
if
marriage
were
the
only
remedy
the
frequent
repetition
of
this
truth
must
bring
him
insensibly
to
doubt
the
rectitude
of
his
determinations
against
it
he
deeply
reflected
on
the
consequences
which
marriage
involves
he
scrutinised
with
the
utmost
accuracy
the
character
of
his
friend
and
surveyed
it
in
all
its
parts
inclination
could
not
fail
of
having
some
influence
on
his
opinions
the
charms
of
this
favourite
object
tended
to
impair
the
clearness
of
his
view
and
extenuate
or
conceal
her
defects
he
entered
on
the
enumeration
of
her
errors
with
reluctance
her
happiness
had
it
been
wholly
disconnected
with
his
own
might
have
had
less
weight
in
the
balance
but
now
every
time
the
scales
were
suspended
this
consideration
acquired
new
weight
most
men
are
influenced
in
the
formation
of
this
contract
by
regards
purely
physical
they
are
incapable
of
higher
views
they
regard
with
indifference
every
tie
that
binds
them
to
their
contemporaries
or
to
posterity
mind
has
no
part
in
the
motives
that
guide
them
they
choose
a
wife
as
they
choose
any
household
movable
and
when
the
irritation
of
the
senses
has
subsided
the
attachment
that
remains
is
the
offspring
of
habit
such
were
not
ormond
modes
of
thinking
his
creed
was
of
too
extraordinary
a
kind
not
to
merit
explication
the
terms
of
this
contract
were
in
his
eyes
iniquitous
and
absurd
he
could
not
think
with
patience
of
a
promise
which
no
time
could
annul
which
pretended
to
ascertain
contingencies
and
regulate
the
future
to
forego
the
liberty
of
choosing
his
companion
and
bind
himself
to
associate
with
one
whom
he
despised
to
raise
to
his
own
level
whom
nature
had
irretrievably
degraded
to
avow
and
persist
in
his
adherence
to
a
falsehood
palpable
and
loathsome
to
his
understanding
to
affirm
that
he
was
blind
when
in
full
possession
of
his
senses
to
shut
his
eyes
and
grope
in
the
dark
and
call
upon
the
compassion
of
mankind
on
his
infirmity
when
his
organs
were
in
no
degree
impaired
and
the
scene
around
him
was
luminous
and
beautiful
was
an
height
of
infatuation
that
he
could
never
attain
and
why
should
he
be
thus
why
should
he
take
a
laborious
circuit
to
reach
a
point
which
when
attained
was
trivial
and
to
which
reason
had
pointed
out
a
road
short
and
direct
a
wife
is
generally
nothing
more
than
a
household
superintendent
this
function
could
not
be
more
wisely
vested
than
it
was
at
present
every
thing
in
his
domestic
system
was
fashioned
on
strict
and
inflexible
principles
he
wanted
instruments
and
not
partakers
of
his
authority
one
whose
mind
was
equal
and
not
superior
to
the
cogent
apprehension
and
punctual
performance
of
his
will
one
whose
character
was
squared
with
mathematical
exactness
to
his
situation
helena
with
all
her
faults
did
not
merit
to
be
regarded
in
this
light
her
introduction
would
destroy
the
harmony
of
his
scheme
and
be
with
respect
to
herself
a
genuine
debasement
a
genuine
evil
would
thus
be
substituted
for
one
that
was
purely
imaginary
helena
intellectual
deficiencies
could
not
be
concealed
she
was
a
proficient
in
the
elements
of
no
science
the
doctrine
of
lines
and
surfaces
was
as
disproportionate
with
her
intellects
as
with
those
of
the
she
had
not
reasoned
on
the
principles
of
human
action
nor
examined
the
structure
of
society
she
was
ignorant
of
the
past
or
present
condition
of
mankind
history
had
not
informed
her
of
the
one
nor
the
narratives
of
voyagers
nor
the
deductions
of
geography
of
the
other
the
heights
of
eloquence
and
poetry
were
shut
out
from
her
view
she
could
not
commune
in
their
native
dialect
with
the
sages
of
rome
and
athens
to
her
those
perennial
fountains
of
wisdom
and
refinement
were
sealed
the
constitution
of
nature
the
attributes
of
its
author
the
arrangement
of
the
parts
of
the
external
universe
and
the
substance
modes
of
operation
and
ultimate
destiny
of
human
intelligence
were
enigmas
unsolved
and
insoluble
by
her
but
this
was
not
all
the
superstructure
could
for
the
present
be
spared
nay
it
was
desirable
that
the
province
of
rearing
it
should
be
reserved
for
him
all
he
wanted
was
a
suitable
foundation
but
this
helena
did
not
possess
he
had
not
hitherto
been
able
to
create
in
her
the
inclination
or
the
power
she
had
listened
to
his
precepts
with
docility
she
had
diligently
conned
the
lessons
which
he
had
prescribed
but
the
impressions
were
as
fleeting
as
if
they
had
been
made
on
water
nature
seemed
to
have
set
impassable
limits
to
her
attainments
this
indeed
was
an
unwelcome
belief
he
struggled
to
invalidate
it
he
reflected
on
the
immaturity
of
her
age
what
but
crude
and
hasty
views
was
it
reasonable
to
expect
at
so
early
a
period
if
her
mind
had
not
been
awakened
it
had
proceeded
perhaps
from
the
injudiciousness
of
his
plans
or
merely
from
their
not
having
been
persisted
in
what
was
wanting
but
the
ornaments
of
mind
to
render
this
being
all
that
poets
have
feigned
of
angelic
nature
when
he
indulged
himself
in
imaging
the
union
of
capacious
understanding
with
her
personal
loveliness
his
conceptions
swelled
to
a
pitch
of
enthusiasm
and
it
seemed
as
if
no
labour
was
too
great
to
be
employed
in
the
production
of
such
a
creature
and
yet
in
the
midst
of
his
glowings
he
would
sink
into
sudden
dejection
at
the
recollection
of
that
which
passion
had
for
a
time
excluded
to
make
her
wise
it
would
be
requisite
to
change
her
sex
he
had
forgotten
that
his
pupil
was
a
female
and
her
capacity
therefore
limited
by
nature
this
mortifying
thought
was
outbalanced
by
nature
her
attainments
indeed
were
suitable
to
the
imbecility
of
her
sex
but
did
she
not
surpass
in
those
attainments
the
ordinary
rate
of
women
they
must
not
be
condemned
because
they
are
outshone
by
qualities
that
are
necessarily
male
births
her
accomplishments
formed
a
much
more
attractive
theme
he
overlooked
no
article
in
the
catalogue
he
was
confounded
at
one
time
and
encouraged
at
another
on
remarking
the
contradictions
that
seemed
to
be
included
in
her
character
it
was
difficult
to
conceive
the
impossibility
of
passing
that
barrier
which
yet
she
was
able
to
touch
she
was
no
poet
she
listened
to
the
rehearsal
without
emotion
or
was
moved
not
by
the
substance
of
the
passage
by
the
dazzling
image
or
the
magic
sympathy
but
by
something
adscititious
yet
usher
her
upon
the
stage
and
no
poet
could
wish
for
a
more
powerful
organ
of
his
conceptions
in
assuming
this
office
she
appeared
to
have
drank
in
the
very
soul
of
the
dramatist
what
was
wanting
in
judgement
was
supplied
by
memory
in
the
tenaciousness
of
which
she
has
seldom
been
rivalled
her
sentiments
were
trite
and
undigested
but
were
decorated
with
all
the
fluences
and
melodies
of
elocution
her
musical
instructor
had
been
a
sicilian
who
had
formed
her
style
after
the
italian
model
this
man
had
likewise
taught
her
his
own
language
he
had
supplied
her
chiefly
with
sicilian
compositions
both
in
poetry
and
melody
and
was
content
to
be
unclassical
for
the
sake
of
the
feminine
and
voluptuous
graces
of
his
native
dialect
ormond
was
an
accurate
judge
of
the
proficiency
of
helena
and
of
the
felicity
with
which
these
accomplishments
were
suited
to
her
character
when
his
pupil
personated
the
victims
of
anger
and
grief
and
poured
forth
the
fiery
indignation
of
calista
or
the
maternal
despair
of
constantia
or
the
of
ipsipile
he
could
not
deny
the
homage
which
her
talents
might
claim
her
sicilian
tutor
had
found
her
no
less
tractable
as
a
votary
of
painting
she
needed
only
the
education
of
angelica
to
exercise
as
potent
and
prolific
a
pencil
this
was
incompatible
with
her
condition
which
limited
her
attainments
to
the
element
of
this
art
it
was
otherwise
with
music
here
there
was
no
obstacle
to
skill
and
here
the
assiduities
of
many
years
in
addition
to
a
prompt
and
ardent
genius
set
her
beyond
the
hopes
of
rivalship
ormond
had
often
amused
his
fancy
with
calling
up
images
of
excellences
in
this
art
he
saw
no
bounds
to
the
influence
of
habit
in
augmenting
the
speed
and
multiplying
the
divisions
of
muscular
motion
the
fingers
by
their
form
and
size
were
qualified
to
outrun
and
elude
the
most
vigilant
eye
the
sensibility
of
keys
and
wires
had
limits
but
these
limits
depended
on
the
structure
of
the
instrument
and
the
perfection
of
its
structure
was
proportioned
to
the
skill
of
the
artist
on
keys
and
strings
was
it
possible
to
carry
diversities
of
movement
and
pressure
too
far
how
far
they
could
be
carried
was
mere
theme
of
conjecture
until
it
was
his
fate
to
listen
to
the
magical
performances
of
helena
whose
volant
finger
seemed
to
be
her
touches
were
creative
of
a
thousand
forms
of
and
of
numberless
transitions
from
grave
to
quick
perceptible
only
to
ears
like
her
own
in
the
selection
and
arrangement
of
notes
there
are
no
limits
to
luxuriance
and
celerity
helena
had
long
relinquished
the
drudgery
of
imitation
she
never
played
but
when
there
were
motives
to
fervour
and
when
she
was
likely
to
ascend
without
impediment
and
to
maintain
for
a
suitable
period
her
elevation
to
the
element
of
new
ideas
the
lyrics
of
milton
and
of
metastasio
she
sung
with
accompaniments
that
never
tired
because
they
were
never
repeated
her
harp
and
clavichord
supplied
her
with
endless
combinations
and
these
in
the
opinion
of
ormond
were
not
inferior
to
the
happiest
exertions
of
handel
and
arne
chess
was
his
favourite
amusement
this
was
the
only
game
which
he
allowed
himself
to
play
he
had
studied
it
with
so
much
zeal
and
success
that
there
were
few
with
whom
he
deigned
to
contend
he
was
prone
to
consider
it
as
a
sort
of
criterion
of
human
capacity
he
who
had
acquired
skill
in
this
could
not
be
infirm
in
mind
and
yet
he
found
in
helena
a
competitor
not
unworthy
of
all
his
energies
many
hours
were
consumed
in
this
employment
and
here
the
lady
was
sedate
considerate
extensive
in
foresight
and
fertile
in
expedients
her
deportment
was
graceful
inasmuch
as
it
flowed
from
a
consciousness
of
her
defects
she
was
devoid
of
arrogance
and
vanity
neither
imagining
herself
better
than
she
was
and
setting
light
by
those
qualifications
which
she
unquestionably
possessed
such
was
the
mixed
character
of
this
woman
ormond
was
occupied
with
schemes
of
a
rugged
and
arduous
nature
his
intimate
associates
and
the
partakers
of
his
confidence
were
imbued
with
the
same
zeal
and
ardent
in
the
same
pursuits
helena
could
lay
no
claim
to
be
exalted
to
this
rank
that
one
destitute
of
this
claim
should
enjoy
the
privileges
of
his
wife
was
still
a
supposition
truly
monstrous
yet
the
image
of
helena
fondly
loving
him
and
a
model
as
he
conceived
of
tenderness
and
constancy
devoured
by
secret
remorse
and
pursued
by
the
scorn
of
mankind
a
mark
for
slander
to
shoot
at
and
an
outcast
of
society
did
not
visit
his
meditations
in
vain
the
rigour
of
his
principles
began
now
to
relent
he
considered
that
various
occupations
are
incident
to
every
man
he
can
not
be
invariably
employed
in
the
promotion
of
one
purpose
he
must
occasionally
unbend
if
he
desires
that
the
springs
of
his
mind
should
retain
their
full
vigour
suppose
his
life
were
divided
between
business
and
amusement
this
was
a
necessary
distribution
and
sufficiently
congenial
with
his
temper
it
became
him
to
select
with
skill
his
sources
of
amusement
it
is
true
that
helena
was
unable
to
participate
in
his
graver
occupations
what
then
in
whom
were
blended
so
many
pleasurable
attributes
in
her
were
assembled
an
exquisite
and
delicious
variety
as
it
was
he
was
daily
in
her
company
he
should
scarcely
be
more
so
if
marriage
should
take
place
in
that
case
no
change
in
their
mode
of
life
would
be
necessary
there
was
no
need
of
dwelling
under
the
same
roof
his
revenue
was
equal
to
the
support
of
many
household
establishments
his
personal
independence
would
remain
equally
inviolable
no
time
he
thought
would
diminish
his
influence
over
the
mind
of
helena
and
it
was
not
to
be
forgotten
that
the
transition
would
to
her
be
happy
it
would
reinstate
her
in
the
esteem
of
the
world
and
dispel
those
phantoms
of
remorse
and
shame
by
which
she
was
at
present
persecuted
these
were
plausible
considerations
they
tended
at
least
to
shake
his
resolutions
time
would
probably
have
completed
the
conquest
of
his
pride
had
not
a
new
incident
set
the
question
in
a
new
light
chapter
iv
the
narrative
of
melbourne
made
a
deeper
impression
on
the
mind
of
his
guest
than
was
at
first
apparent
this
man
conduct
was
directed
by
the
present
impulse
and
however
elaborate
his
abstract
notions
he
seldom
stopped
to
settle
the
agreement
between
his
principles
and
actions
the
use
of
money
was
a
science
like
every
other
branch
of
benevolence
not
reducible
to
any
fixed
principles
no
man
in
the
disbursement
of
money
could
say
whether
he
was
conferring
a
benefit
or
injury
the
visible
and
immediate
effects
might
be
good
but
evil
was
its
ultimate
and
general
tendency
to
be
governed
by
a
view
to
the
present
rather
than
the
future
was
a
human
infirmity
from
which
he
did
not
pretend
to
be
exempt
this
though
an
insufficient
apology
for
the
conduct
of
a
rational
being
was
suitable
to
his
indolence
and
he
was
content
in
all
cases
to
employ
it
it
was
thus
that
he
reconciled
himself
to
beneficent
acts
and
humourously
held
himself
up
as
an
object
of
censure
on
occasions
when
most
entitled
to
applause
he
easily
procured
information
as
to
the
character
and
situation
of
the
dudleys
neighbours
are
always
inquisitive
and
happily
in
this
case
were
enabled
to
make
no
unfavourable
report
he
resolved
without
hesitation
to
supply
their
wants
this
he
performed
in
a
manner
truly
characteristic
there
was
a
method
of
gaining
access
to
families
and
marking
them
in
their
unguarded
attitudes
more
easy
and
effectual
than
any
other
it
required
least
preparation
and
cost
least
pains
the
disguise
also
was
of
the
most
impenetrable
kind
he
had
served
a
sort
of
occasional
apprenticeship
to
the
art
and
executed
its
functions
with
perfect
ease
it
was
the
most
entire
and
grotesque
metamorphosis
imaginable
it
was
stepping
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
rank
in
society
and
shifting
himself
into
a
form
as
remote
from
his
own
as
those
recorded
by
ovid
in
a
word
it
was
sometimes
his
practice
to
exchange
his
complexion
and
habiliments
for
those
of
a
negro
and
a
and
to
call
at
certain
doors
for
employment
this
he
generally
secured
by
importunities
and
the
cheapness
of
his
services
when
the
loftiness
of
his
port
and
the
punctiliousness
of
his
nicety
were
considered
we
should
never
have
believed
what
yet
could
be
truly
asserted
that
he
had
frequently
swept
his
own
chimneys
without
the
knowledge
of
his
own
servants
it
was
likewise
true
though
equally
incredible
that
he
had
played
at
romps
with
his
scullion
and
listened
with
patience
to
a
thousand
slanders
on
his
own
character
similar
exploits
are
related
of
count
de
la
lippe
and
wortley
montague
in
this
disguise
he
visited
the
house
of
dudley
it
was
nine
in
the
morning
he
remarked
with
critical
eyes
the
minutest
circumstance
in
the
appearance
and
demeanour
of
his
customers
and
glanced
curiously
at
the
house
and
furniture
every
thing
was
new
and
every
thing
pleased
the
walls
though
broken
into
roughness
by
carelessness
or
time
were
adorned
with
glistening
white
the
floor
though
loose
and
uneven
and
with
gaping
seams
had
received
all
the
improvements
which
cloth
and
brush
could
give
the
pine
tables
rush
chairs
and
uncurtained
bed
had
been
purchased
at
half
price
at
vendue
and
exhibited
various
tokens
of
decay
but
care
and
neatness
and
order
were
displayed
in
their
condition
and
arrangement
the
lower
apartment
was
the
eating
and
sitting
room
it
was
likewise
dudley
bed
chamber
the
upper
room
was
occupied
by
constantia
and
lucy
ormond
viewed
every
thing
with
the
accuracy
of
an
artist
and
carried
away
with
him
a
catalogue
of
every
thing
visible
the
faded
form
of
dudley
that
still
retained
its
dignity
the
sedateness
graceful
condescension
and
personal
elegance
of
constantia
were
new
to
the
apprehension
of
ormond
the
contrast
between
the
house
and
its
inhabitants
rendered
the
appearance
more
striking
when
he
had
finished
his
task
he
retired
but
returning
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
presented
a
letter
to
the
young
lady
he
behaved
as
if
by
no
means
desirous
of
eluding
her
interrogatories
and
when
she
desired
him
to
stay
readily
complied
the
letter
unsigned
and
without
superscription
was
to
this
effect
the
writer
of
this
is
acquainted
with
the
transaction
between
thomas
craig
and
dudley
the
former
is
debtor
to
dudley
in
a
large
sum
i
have
undertaken
to
pay
as
much
of
this
debt
and
at
such
times
as
suits
my
convenience
i
have
had
pecuniary
engagements
with
craig
i
hold
myself
in
the
sum
enclosed
discharging
so
much
of
his
debt
the
future
payments
are
uncertain
but
i
hope
they
will
contribute
to
relieve
the
necessities
of
mr
dudley
ormond
had
calculated
the
amount
of
what
would
be
necessary
for
the
annual
subsistence
of
this
family
on
the
present
frugal
plan
he
had
regulated
his
disbursements
accordingly
it
was
natural
to
feel
curiosity
as
to
the
writer
of
this
epistle
the
bearer
displayed
a
prompt
and
talkative
disposition
he
had
a
staring
eye
and
a
grin
of
vivacity
forever
at
command
when
questioned
by
constantia
he
answered
that
the
gentleman
had
forbidden
him
to
mention
his
name
or
the
place
where
he
lived
had
he
ever
met
with
the
same
person
before
o
yes
he
had
lived
with
him
from
a
child
his
mother
lived
with
him
still
and
his
brothers
his
master
had
nothing
for
him
to
do
at
home
so
he
sent
him
out
sweeping
chimneys
taking
from
him
only
half
the
money
that
he
earned
that
way
he
was
a
very
good
master
then
the
gentleman
had
been
a
long
time
in
the
city
o
yes
all
his
life
he
reckoned
ho
used
to
live
in
walnut
street
but
now
he
moved
down
town
here
he
checked
himself
and
added
but
i
forgets
i
must
not
tell
where
he
livest
he
told
me
i
he
has
a
family
and
children
i
suppose
o
yes
why
do
you
know
miss
hetty
and
miss
betsy
there
again
i
was
going
to
tell
the
name
that
he
said
i
must
not
tell
constantia
saw
that
the
secret
might
be
easily
discovered
but
she
forbore
she
disdained
to
take
advantage
of
this
messenger
imagined
simplicity
she
dismissed
him
with
some
small
addition
to
his
demand
and
with
a
promise
always
to
employ
him
in
this
way
by
this
mode
ormond
had
effectually
concealed
himself
the
conjectures
founded
on
this
delusive
information
necessarily
wandered
widely
from
the
truth
the
observations
that
he
had
made
during
this
visit
afforded
his
mind
considerable
employment
the
manner
in
which
this
lady
had
sustained
so
cruel
a
reverse
of
fortune
the
cheerfulness
with
which
she
appeared
to
forego
all
the
gratifications
of
affluence
the
skill
with
which
she
selected
her
path
of
humble
industry
and
the
steadiness
with
which
she
pursued
it
were
proofs
of
a
moral
constitution
from
which
he
supposed
the
female
sex
to
be
debarred
the
comparison
was
obvious
between
constantia
and
helena
and
the
result
was
by
no
means
advantageous
to
the
latter
was
it
possible
that
such
a
one
descended
to
the
level
of
her
father
apprentice
that
she
sacrificed
her
honour
to
a
wretch
like
that
this
reflection
tended
to
repress
the
inclination
he
would
otherwise
have
felt
for
cultivating
her
society
but
it
did
not
indispose
him
to
benefit
her
in
a
certain
way
on
his
next
visit
to
his
bella
siciliana
as
he
called
her
he
questioned
her
as
to
the
need
in
which
she
might
stand
of
the
services
of
a
seamstress
and
being
informed
that
they
were
sometimes
wanted
he
recommended
miss
acworth
to
her
patronage
he
said
that
he
had
heard
her
spoken
of
in
favourable
terms
by
the
gossips
at
melbourne
they
represented
her
as
a
good
girl
slenderly
provided
for
and
he
wished
that
helena
would
prefer
her
to
all
others
his
recommendation
was
sufficient
the
wishes
of
ormond
as
soon
as
they
became
known
became
hers
her
temper
made
her
always
diligent
in
search
of
novelty
it
was
easy
to
make
work
for
the
needle
in
short
she
resolved
to
send
for
her
the
next
day
the
interview
accordingly
took
place
on
the
ensuing
morning
not
without
mutual
surprise
and
on
the
part
of
the
fair
sicilian
not
without
considerable
embarrassment
this
circumstance
arose
from
their
having
changed
their
respective
names
though
from
motives
of
a
very
different
kind
they
were
not
strangers
to
each
other
though
no
intimacy
had
ever
subsisted
between
them
each
was
merely
acquainted
with
the
name
person
and
general
character
of
the
other
no
circumstance
in
constantia
situation
tended
to
embarrass
her
her
mind
had
attained
a
state
of
serene
composure
incapable
of
being
ruffled
by
an
incident
of
this
kind
she
merely
derived
pleasure
from
the
sight
of
her
old
acquaintance
the
aspect
of
things
around
her
was
splendid
and
gay
she
seemed
the
mistress
of
the
mansion
and
her
name
was
changed
hence
it
was
unavoidable
to
conclude
that
she
was
married
helena
was
conscious
that
appearances
were
calculated
to
suggest
this
conclusion
the
idea
was
a
painful
one
she
sorrowed
to
think
that
this
conclusion
was
fallacious
the
consciousness
that
her
true
condition
was
unknown
to
her
visitant
and
the
ignominiousness
of
that
truth
gave
an
air
of
constraint
to
her
behaviour
which
constantia
ascribed
to
a
principle
of
delicacy
in
the
midst
of
reflections
relative
to
herself
she
admitted
some
share
of
surprise
at
the
discovery
of
constantia
in
a
situation
so
inferior
to
that
in
which
she
had
formerly
known
her
she
had
heard
in
general
terms
of
the
misfortunes
of
mr
dudley
but
was
unacquainted
with
particulars
but
this
surprise
and
the
difficulty
of
adapting
her
behaviour
to
circumstances
was
only
in
part
the
source
of
her
embarrassment
though
by
her
companion
it
was
wholly
attributed
to
this
cause
constantia
thought
it
her
duty
to
remove
it
by
open
and
unaffected
manners
she
therefore
said
in
a
sedate
and
cheerful
tone
you
see
me
madam
in
a
situation
somewhat
unlike
that
in
which
i
formerly
was
placed
you
will
probably
regard
the
change
as
an
unhappy
one
but
i
assure
you
i
have
found
it
far
less
so
than
i
expected
i
am
thus
reduced
not
by
my
own
fault
it
is
this
reflection
that
enables
me
to
conform
to
it
without
a
murmur
i
shall
rejoice
to
know
that
eden
is
as
happy
as
i
am
helena
was
pleased
with
this
address
and
returned
an
answer
full
of
sweetness
she
had
not
in
her
compassion
for
the
fallen
a
particle
of
pride
she
thought
of
nothing
but
the
contrast
between
the
former
situation
of
her
visitant
and
the
present
the
fame
of
her
great
qualities
had
formerly
excited
veneration
and
that
reverence
was
by
no
means
diminished
by
a
nearer
scrutiny
the
consciousness
of
her
own
frailty
meanwhile
diffused
over
the
behaviour
of
helena
a
timidity
and
dubiousness
uncommonly
fascinating
she
solicited
friendship
in
a
manner
that
showed
she
was
afraid
of
nothing
but
denial
an
assent
was
eagerly
given
and
thenceforth
a
cordial
intercourse
was
established
between
them
the
real
situation
of
helena
was
easily
discovered
the
officious
person
who
communicated
this
information
at
the
same
time
cautioned
constantia
against
associating
with
one
of
tainted
reputation
this
information
threw
some
light
upon
appearances
it
accounted
for
that
melancholy
which
helena
was
unable
to
conceal
it
explained
that
solitude
in
which
she
lived
and
which
constantia
had
ascribed
to
the
death
or
absence
of
her
husband
it
justified
the
solicitous
silence
she
had
hitherto
maintained
respecting
her
own
affairs
and
which
her
friend
good
sense
forbade
her
to
employ
any
sinister
means
of
eluding
no
long
time
was
necessary
to
make
her
mistress
of
helena
character
she
loved
her
with
uncommon
warmth
though
by
no
means
blind
to
her
defects
she
formed
no
expectations
from
the
knowledge
of
her
character
to
which
this
intelligence
operated
as
a
disappointment
it
merely
excited
her
pity
and
made
her
thoughtful
how
she
might
assist
her
in
repairing
this
deplorable
error
this
design
was
of
no
ordinary
magnitude
she
saw
that
it
was
previously
necessary
to
obtain
the
confidence
of
helena
this
was
a
task
of
easy
performance
she
knew
the
purity
of
her
own
motives
and
the
extent
of
her
powers
and
embarked
in
this
undertaking
with
full
confidence
of
success
she
had
only
to
profit
by
a
private
interview
to
acquaint
her
friend
with
what
she
knew
to
solicit
a
complete
and
satisfactory
disclosure
to
explain
the
impressions
which
her
intelligence
produced
and
to
offer
her
disinterested
advice
no
one
knew
better
how
to
couch
her
ideas
in
words
suitable
to
the
end
proposed
by
her
in
imparting
them
helena
was
at
first
terrified
but
the
benevolence
of
her
friend
quickly
entitled
her
to
confidence
and
gratitude
that
knew
no
limits
she
had
been
deterred
from
unveiling
her
heart
by
the
fear
of
exciting
contempt
or
abhorrence
but
when
she
found
that
all
due
allowances
were
made
that
her
conduct
was
treated
as
erroneous
in
no
atrocious
or
inexpiable
degree
and
as
far
front
being
insusceptible
of
remedy
that
the
obloquy
with
which
she
had
been
treated
found
no
vindicator
or
participator
in
her
friend
her
heart
was
considerably
relieved
she
had
been
long
a
stranger
to
the
sympathy
and
intercourse
of
her
own
sex
now
this
good
in
its
most
precious
form
was
conferred
upon
her
and
she
experienced
an
increase
rather
than
diminution
of
tenderness
in
consequence
of
her
true
situation
being
known
she
made
no
secret
of
any
part
of
her
history
she
did
full
justice
to
the
integrity
of
her
lover
and
explained
the
unforced
conditions
on
which
she
had
consented
to
live
with
him
this
relation
exhibited
the
character
of
ormond
in
a
very
uncommon
light
his
asperities
wounded
and
his
sternness
chilled
what
unauthorised
conceptions
of
matrimonial
and
political
equality
did
he
entertain
he
had
fashioned
his
treatment
of
helena
on
sullen
and
ferocious
principles
yet
he
was
able
it
seemed
to
mould
her
by
means
of
them
nearly
into
the
creature
that
he
wished
she
knew
too
little
of
the
man
justly
to
estimate
his
character
it
remained
to
be
ascertained
whether
his
purposes
were
consistent
and
upright
or
were
those
of
a
villain
and
betrayer
meanwhile
what
was
to
be
done
by
helena
marriage
had
been
refused
op
plausible
pretences
her
unenlightened
understanding
made
her
no
match
for
her
lover
she
would
never
maintain
her
claim
to
nuptial
privileges
in
his
presence
or
if
she
did
she
would
never
convince
him
of
their
validity
were
they
indeed
valid
was
not
the
disparity
between
them
incurable
a
marriage
of
minds
so
dissimilar
could
only
be
productive
of
misery
immediately
to
him
and
by
a
reflex
operation
to
herself
she
could
not
be
happy
in
a
union
that
was
the
source
of
regret
to
her
husband
marriage
therefore
was
not
possible
or
if
possible
was
not
perhaps
to
be
wished
but
what
was
the
choice
that
remained
to
continue
in
her
present
situation
was
not
to
be
endured
disgrace
was
a
dæmon
that
would
blast
every
hope
of
happiness
she
was
excluded
from
all
society
but
that
of
the
depraved
her
situation
was
eminently
critical
it
depended
perhaps
on
the
resolution
she
should
now
form
whether
she
would
be
enrolled
among
the
worst
of
mankind
infamy
is
the
worst
of
evils
it
creates
innumerable
obstructions
in
the
paths
of
virtue
it
manacles
the
hand
and
entangles
the
feet
that
are
active
only
to
good
to
the
weak
it
is
an
evil
of
much
greater
magnitude
it
determines
their
destiny
and
they
hasten
to
merit
that
reproach
which
at
first
it
may
be
they
did
not
deserve
this
connection
is
intrinsically
flagitious
helena
is
subjected
by
it
to
the
worst
ills
that
are
incident
to
humanity
the
general
contempt
of
mankind
and
the
reproaches
of
her
own
conscience
from
these
there
is
but
one
method
from
which
she
can
hope
to
be
relieved
the
intercourse
must
cease
it
wad
easier
to
see
the
propriety
of
separation
than
to
project
means
for
accomplishing
it
it
was
true
that
helena
loved
but
what
quarter
was
due
to
this
passion
when
divorced
from
integrity
is
it
not
in
every
bosom
a
perishable
sentiment
whatever
be
her
warmth
absence
will
congeal
it
place
her
in
new
scenes
and
supply
her
with
new
associates
her
accomplishments
will
not
fail
to
attract
votaries
from
these
she
may
select
a
conjugal
companion
suitable
to
her
mediocrity
of
talents
but
alas
what
power
on
earth
can
prevail
on
her
to
renounce
ormond
others
may
justly
entertain
this
prospect
but
it
must
be
invisible
to
her
besides
is
it
absolutely
certain
that
either
her
peace
of
mind
or
her
reputation
will
be
restored
by
this
means
in
the
opinion
of
the
world
her
offences
can
not
by
any
perseverance
in
penitence
be
expiated
she
will
never
believe
that
separation
will
exterminate
her
passion
certain
it
is
that
it
will
avail
nothing
to
the
of
her
fame
but
if
it
were
conducive
to
these
ends
how
chimerical
to
suppose
that
she
will
ever
voluntarily
adopt
it
if
ormond
refuse
his
concurrence
there
is
absolutely
an
end
to
hope
and
what
power
on
earth
is
able
to
sway
his
determinations
at
least
what
influence
was
it
possible
for
her
to
obtain
over
them
should
they
separate
whither
should
she
retire
what
mode
of
subsistence
should
she
adopt
she
has
never
been
accustomed
to
think
beyond
the
day
she
has
eaten
and
drank
but
another
has
provided
the
means
she
scarcely
comprehends
the
principle
that
governs
the
world
and
in
consequence
of
which
nothing
can
be
gained
but
by
giving
something
in
exchange
for
it
she
is
ignorant
and
helpless
as
a
child
on
every
topic
that
relates
to
the
procuring
of
subsistence
her
education
has
disabled
her
from
standing
alone
but
this
was
not
all
she
must
not
only
be
supplied
by
others
but
sustained
in
the
enjoyment
of
a
luxurious
existence
would
you
bereave
her
of
the
gratifications
of
opulence
you
had
better
take
away
her
life
nay
it
would
ultimately
amount
to
this
she
can
live
but
in
one
way
at
present
she
is
lovely
and
to
a
certain
degree
innocent
but
expose
her
to
the
urgencies
and
temptations
of
want
let
personal
pollution
be
the
price
set
upon
the
voluptuous
affluences
of
her
present
condition
and
it
is
to
be
feared
there
is
nothing
in
the
contexture
of
her
mind
to
hinder
her
from
making
the
purchase
in
every
respect
therefore
the
prospect
was
an
hopeless
one
so
hopeless
that
her
mind
insensibly
returned
to
the
question
which
she
had
at
first
dismissed
with
very
slight
examination
the
question
relative
to
the
advantages
and
probabilities
of
marriage
a
more
accurate
review
convinced
her
that
this
was
the
most
eligible
alternative
it
was
likewise
most
easily
effected
the
lady
of
course
would
be
its
fervent
advocate
there
did
not
want
reasons
why
ormond
should
finally
embrace
it
in
what
manner
appeals
to
his
reason
of
his
passion
might
most
effectually
be
made
she
knew
not
helena
was
not
qualified
to
be
her
own
advocate
her
unhappiness
could
not
but
be
visible
to
ormond
he
had
shown
himself
attentive
and
affectionate
was
it
impossible
that
in
time
he
should
reason
himself
into
a
spontaneous
adoption
of
this
scheme
this
indeed
was
a
slender
foundation
for
hope
but
there
was
no
other
on
which
she
could
build
such
were
the
meditations
of
constantia
on
this
topic
she
was
deeply
solicitous
for
the
happiness
of
her
friend
they
spent
much
of
their
time
together
the
consolations
of
her
society
were
earnestly
sought
by
helena
but
to
enjoy
them
she
was
for
the
most
part
obliged
to
visit
the
former
at
her
own
dwelling
for
this
arrangement
constantia
apologized
by
saying
you
will
pardon
my
requesting
you
to
favour
me
with
your
visits
rather
than
allowing
you
mine
every
thing
is
airy
and
brilliant
within
these
walls
there
is
besides
an
air
of
seclusion
and
security
about
you
that
is
delightful
in
comparison
my
dwelling
is
bleak
comfortless
and
unretired
but
my
father
is
entitled
to
all
my
care
his
infirmity
prevents
him
from
amusing
himself
and
his
heart
is
cheered
by
the
mere
sound
of
my
voice
though
not
addressed
to
him
the
mere
belief
of
my
presence
seems
to
operate
as
an
antidote
to
the
dreariness
of
solitude
and
now
you
know
my
motives
i
am
sure
you
will
not
only
forgive
but
approve
of
my
request
chapter
when
once
the
subject
had
been
introduced
helena
was
prone
to
descant
upon
her
own
situation
and
listened
with
deference
to
the
remarks
and
admonitions
of
her
companion
constantia
did
not
conceal
from
her
any
of
her
sentiments
she
enabled
her
to
view
her
own
condition
in
its
true
light
and
set
before
her
the
indispensable
advantages
of
marriage
while
she
at
the
same
time
afforded
her
the
best
directions
as
to
the
conduct
she
ought
to
pursue
in
order
to
effect
her
purpose
the
mind
of
helena
was
thus
kept
in
a
state
of
perpetual
and
uneasy
fluctuation
while
absent
from
ormond
or
listening
to
her
remonstrances
the
deplorableness
of
her
condition
arose
in
its
most
disastrous
hues
before
her
imagination
but
the
spectre
seldom
failed
to
vanish
at
the
approach
of
ormond
his
voice
dissipated
every
inquietude
she
was
not
insensible
of
this
inconstancy
she
perceived
and
lamented
her
own
weakness
she
was
destitute
of
all
confidence
in
her
own
exertions
she
could
not
be
in
the
perpetual
enjoyment
of
his
company
her
intervals
of
tranquillity
therefore
were
short
while
those
of
anxiety
and
dejection
were
insupportably
tedious
she
revered
but
believed
herself
incapable
to
emulate
the
magnanimity
of
her
monitor
the
consciousness
of
inferiority
especially
in
a
case
like
this
in
which
her
happiness
so
much
depended
on
her
own
exertions
excited
in
her
the
most
humiliating
sensations
while
indulging
in
fruitless
melancholy
the
thought
one
day
occurred
to
her
why
may
not
constantia
be
prevailed
upon
to
plead
my
cause
her
capacity
and
courage
are
equal
to
any
undertaking
the
reasonings
that
are
so
powerful
in
my
eyes
would
they
he
trivial
and
futile
in
those
of
ormond
i
can
not
have
a
more
pathetic
and
disinterested
advocate
this
idea
was
cherished
with
uncommon
ardour
she
seized
the
first
opportunity
that
offered
itself
to
impart
it
to
her
friend
it
was
a
wild
and
singular
proposal
and
was
rejected
at
the
first
glance
this
scheme
so
romantic
and
impracticable
as
it
at
first
seemed
appeared
to
helena
in
the
most
plausible
colours
she
could
not
bear
to
relinquish
her
hopes
she
saw
no
valid
objection
to
it
every
thing
was
easy
to
her
friend
provided
her
sense
of
duty
and
her
zeal
could
be
awakened
the
subject
was
frequently
suggested
to
reflections
perceiving
the
sanguineness
of
her
friend
confidence
and
fully
impressed
with
the
value
of
the
end
to
be
accomplished
she
insensibly
veered
to
the
same
opinion
at
least
the
scheme
was
worthy
of
a
candid
discussion
before
it
was
rejected
ormond
was
a
stranger
to
her
his
manners
were
repulsive
and
austere
she
was
a
mere
girl
her
personal
attachment
to
helena
was
all
that
she
could
plead
in
excuse
for
taking
part
in
her
concerns
the
subject
was
delicate
a
blunt
and
irregular
character
like
ormond
might
throw
an
air
of
ridicule
over
the
scene
she
shrunk
from
the
encounter
of
a
boisterous
and
manlike
spirit
but
were
not
these
scruples
effeminate
and
puerile
had
she
studied
so
long
in
the
school
of
adversity
without
conviction
of
the
duty
of
a
virtuous
independence
was
she
not
a
rational
being
fully
imbued
with
the
justice
of
her
cause
was
it
not
ignoble
to
refuse
the
province
of
a
vindicator
of
the
injured
before
any
tribunal
however
tremendous
or
unjust
and
who
was
ormond
that
his
eye
should
inspire
terror
the
father
or
brother
of
helena
might
assume
the
office
without
indecorum
nay
a
mother
or
sister
might
not
be
debarred
from
it
why
then
should
she
who
was
actuated
by
equal
zeal
and
was
engaged
by
ties
stronger
than
consanguinity
in
the
promotion
of
her
happiness
it
is
true
she
did
not
view
the
subject
in
the
light
in
which
it
was
commonly
viewed
by
brothers
and
parents
it
was
not
a
gust
of
rage
that
should
transport
her
into
his
presence
she
did
not
go
to
awaken
his
slumbering
conscience
and
to
abash
him
in
the
pride
of
guilty
triumph
but
to
rectify
deliberate
errors
and
to
change
his
course
by
the
change
of
his
principles
it
was
her
business
to
point
out
to
him
the
road
of
duty
and
happiness
from
which
he
had
strayed
with
no
sinister
intentions
this
was
to
be
done
without
raving
and
fury
but
with
amicable
soberness
and
in
the
way
of
calm
and
rational
remonstrance
yet
there
were
scruples
that
would
not
be
shut
out
and
continually
whispered
to
her
what
an
office
is
this
for
a
girl
and
a
stranger
to
assume
in
what
manner
should
it
be
performed
should
an
interview
be
sought
and
her
ideas
be
explained
without
confusion
or
faltering
undismayed
by
ludicrous
airs
or
insolent
frowns
but
this
was
a
point
to
be
examined
was
ormond
capable
of
such
behaviour
if
he
were
it
would
be
useless
to
attempt
the
reformation
of
his
errors
such
a
man
is
incurable
and
obdurate
such
a
man
is
not
to
be
sought
as
the
husband
of
helena
but
this
surely
is
a
different
being
the
medium
through
which
she
had
viewed
his
character
was
an
ample
one
but
might
not
be
very
accurate
the
treatment
which
helena
had
received
from
him
exclusive
of
his
fundamental
error
betokened
a
mind
to
which
she
did
not
disdain
to
be
allied
in
spite
of
his
defects
she
saw
that
their
elements
were
more
congenial
and
the
points
of
contact
between
this
person
and
herself
more
numerous
than
between
her
and
helena
whose
voluptuous
sweetness
of
temper
and
mediocrity
of
understanding
excited
in
her
bosom
no
genuine
sympathy
every
thing
is
progressive
in
the
human
mind
when
there
is
leisure
to
reflect
ideas
will
succeed
each
other
in
a
long
train
before
the
ultimate
point
be
gained
the
attention
must
shift
from
one
side
to
the
other
of
a
given
question
many
times
before
it
settles
constantia
did
not
form
her
resolutions
in
haste
but
when
once
formed
they
were
exempt
from
fluctuation
she
reflected
before
she
acted
and
therefore
acted
with
consistency
and
vigour
she
did
not
apprize
her
friend
of
her
intention
she
was
willing
that
she
should
benefit
by
her
interposition
before
she
knew
it
was
employed
she
sent
her
lucy
with
a
note
to
ormond
house
it
was
couched
in
these
terms
constantia
dudley
requests
an
interview
with
ormond
her
business
being
of
some
moment
she
wishes
him
to
name
an
hour
when
most
disengaged
an
answer
was
immediately
returned
that
at
three
in
the
afternoon
he
should
be
glad
to
see
her
this
message
produced
no
small
surprise
in
ormond
he
had
not
withdrawn
his
notice
from
constantia
and
had
marked
with
curiosity
and
approbation
the
progress
of
the
connexion
between
the
two
women
the
impressions
which
he
had
received
from
the
report
of
helena
were
not
dissimilar
to
those
which
constantia
had
imbibed
from
the
same
quarter
respecting
himself
but
he
gathered
from
them
no
suspicion
of
the
purpose
of
a
visit
he
recollected
his
connection
with
craig
this
lady
had
had
an
opportunity
of
knowing
that
some
connection
subsisted
between
them
he
concluded
that
some
information
or
inquiry
respecting
craig
might
occasion
this
event
as
it
was
it
gave
him
considerable
satisfaction
it
would
enable
him
more
closely
to
examine
one
with
respect
to
whom
he
entertained
great
curiosity
ormond
conjecture
was
partly
right
constantia
did
not
forget
her
having
traced
craig
to
this
habitation
she
designed
to
profit
by
the
occasion
which
this
circumstance
afforded
her
of
making
some
inquiry
respecting
craig
in
order
to
introduce
by
suitable
degrees
a
more
important
subject
the
appointed
hour
having
arrived
he
received
her
in
his
he
knew
what
was
due
to
his
guest
he
loved
to
mortify
by
his
negligence
the
pride
of
his
equals
and
superiors
but
a
lower
class
had
nothing
to
fear
from
his
insolence
constantia
took
the
seat
that
was
offered
to
her
without
speaking
she
had
made
suitable
preparations
for
this
interview
and
her
composure
was
invincible
the
manners
of
her
host
were
by
no
means
calculated
to
disconcert
her
his
air
was
conciliating
and
attentive
she
began
with
naming
craig
as
one
known
to
ormond
and
desired
to
be
informed
of
his
place
of
abode
she
was
proceeding
to
apologise
for
this
request
by
explaining
in
general
terms
that
her
father
infirmities
prevented
him
from
acting
for
himself
that
craig
was
his
debtor
to
a
large
amount
that
he
stood
in
need
of
all
that
justly
belonged
to
him
and
was
in
pursuit
of
some
means
of
tracing
craig
to
his
retreat
ormond
interrupted
her
examining
at
the
same
time
with
a
vigilance
somewhat
too
unsparing
the
effects
which
his
words
should
produce
upon
her
you
may
spare
yourself
the
trouble
of
explaining
i
am
acquainted
with
the
whole
affair
between
craig
and
your
family
he
has
concealed
from
me
nothing
i
know
that
has
passed
between
you
in
saying
this
ormond
intended
that
his
looks
and
emphasis
should
convey
his
full
meaning
in
the
style
of
her
comments
he
saw
none
of
those
corroborating
symptoms
that
he
expected
indeed
he
has
been
very
liberal
of
his
confidence
confession
is
a
token
of
penitence
but
alas
i
fear
he
has
deceived
you
to
be
sincere
was
doubtless
his
true
interest
but
he
is
too
much
in
the
habit
of
judging
superficially
if
he
has
told
you
all
there
is
indeed
no
need
of
explanation
this
visit
is
in
that
case
sufficiently
accounted
for
is
it
in
your
power
sir
to
inform
us
whither
he
has
gone
for
what
end
should
i
tell
you
i
promise
you
you
will
not
follow
him
take
my
word
for
it
he
is
totally
unworthy
of
you
let
the
past
be
no
precedent
for
the
future
if
you
have
not
made
that
discovery
yourself
i
have
made
it
for
you
i
expect
at
least
to
be
thanked
for
my
trouble
this
speech
was
unintelligible
to
constantia
her
looks
betokened
a
perplexity
unmingled
with
fear
or
shame
it
is
my
way
continued
he
to
say
what
i
think
i
care
little
for
consequences
i
have
said
that
i
know
this
will
excuse
me
for
being
perfectly
explicit
that
i
am
mistaken
is
very
possible
but
i
am
inclined
to
place
that
matter
beyond
the
reach
of
a
doubt
listen
to
me
and
confirm
me
in
the
opinion
i
have
already
formed
of
your
good
sense
by
viewing
in
a
just
light
the
unreservedness
with
which
you
are
treated
i
have
something
to
tell
which
if
you
are
wise
you
will
not
be
offended
at
my
telling
so
roundly
on
the
contrary
you
will
thank
me
and
perceive
that
my
conduct
is
a
proof
of
my
respect
for
you
the
person
whom
you
met
here
is
named
craig
but
as
he
tells
me
is
not
the
man
you
look
for
this
man
brother
the
partner
of
your
father
and
as
he
assured
me
your
own
accepted
and
lover
is
dead
these
words
were
uttered
without
any
extenuating
hesitation
or
depression
of
tone
on
the
contrary
the
most
offensive
terms
were
drawn
out
in
the
most
deliberate
and
emphatic
manner
constantia
cheeks
glowed
and
her
eyes
sparkled
with
indignation
but
she
forbore
to
interrupt
the
looks
with
which
she
listened
to
the
remainder
of
the
speech
showed
that
she
fully
comprehended
the
scene
and
enabled
him
to
comprehend
it
he
proceeded
this
man
is
a
brother
of
that
their
resemblance
in
figure
occasioned
your
mistake
your
father
debtor
died
it
seems
on
his
arrival
at
jamaica
there
he
met
with
this
brother
and
bequeathed
to
him
his
property
and
papers
some
of
these
papers
are
in
my
possession
they
are
letters
from
constantia
dudley
and
are
parts
of
an
intrigue
which
considering
the
character
of
the
man
was
not
much
to
her
honour
such
was
this
man
narrative
told
to
me
some
time
before
your
meeting
with
him
at
his
house
i
have
right
to
judge
in
this
affair
that
is
i
have
a
right
to
my
opinion
if
i
mistake
and
i
half
suspect
myself
you
are
able
perhaps
to
rectify
my
error
and
in
a
case
like
this
doubtless
you
will
not
want
the
inclination
perhaps
if
the
countenance
of
this
man
had
not
been
characterized
by
the
keenest
intelligence
and
a
sort
of
careless
and
overflowing
this
speech
might
have
produced
different
effects
she
was
prepared
though
imperfectly
for
entering
into
his
character
he
waited
for
an
answer
which
she
gave
without
emotion
you
were
deceived
i
am
sorry
for
your
own
sake
that
you
are
he
must
have
had
some
end
in
view
in
imposing
these
falsehoods
upon
you
which
perhaps
they
have
enabled
him
to
accomplish
as
to
myself
this
man
can
do
me
no
injury
i
willingly
make
you
my
judge
the
letters
you
speak
of
will
alone
suffice
to
my
vindication
they
never
were
received
from
me
and
are
forgeries
that
man
always
persisted
till
he
made
himself
the
dupe
of
his
own
artifices
that
incident
in
his
plot
on
the
introduction
of
which
he
probably
the
most
applauded
himself
will
most
powerfully
operate
to
defeat
it
those
letters
never
were
received
from
me
and
are
forgeries
his
skill
in
imitation
extended
no
farther
in
the
present
case
than
my
handwriting
my
model
of
thinking
and
expression
were
beyond
the
reach
of
his
mimicry
when
she
had
finished
osmond
spent
a
moment
in
ruminating
i
perceive
you
are
right
said
he
i
suppose
he
has
purloined
from
me
two
hundred
guineas
which
i
entrusted
to
his
fidelity
and
yet
i
received
a
letter
but
that
may
likewise
be
a
forgery
by
my
soul
continued
he
in
a
tone
that
had
more
of
satisfaction
than
disappointment
in
it
this
fellow
was
an
adept
at
his
trade
i
do
not
repine
i
have
bought
the
exhibition
at
a
cheap
rate
the
pains
that
he
took
did
not
merit
a
less
recompense
i
am
glad
that
he
was
contented
with
so
little
had
he
persisted
he
might
have
raised
the
price
far
above
its
value
be
lamentable
if
he
receive
more
than
he
stipulated
for
if
in
his
last
purchase
the
gallows
should
be
thrown
into
the
bargain
may
he
have
the
wisdom
to
see
that
a
halter
though
not
included
in
his
terms
is
only
a
new
instance
of
his
good
fortune
but
his
cunning
will
hardly
carry
him
thus
far
his
stupidity
will
no
doubt
prefer
a
lingering
to
a
sudden
exit
but
this
man
and
his
destiny
are
trifles
let
us
leave
them
to
themselves
your
name
is
constantia
was
given
you
i
suppose
that
you
might
be
known
by
it
constantia
was
this
the
only
purpose
that
brought
you
hither
if
it
were
it
has
received
as
ample
a
discussion
as
it
merits
you
for
this
end
but
will
remain
i
hope
for
a
better
one
haying
dismissed
craig
and
his
plots
let
us
now
talk
of
each
other
i
confess
said
the
lady
with
an
hesitation
she
could
not
subdue
this
was
not
my
only
purpose
one
much
more
important
has
produced
this
visit
indeed
pray
let
me
know
it
i
am
glad
that
so
trivial
an
object
as
craig
did
not
occupy
the
first
place
in
your
thoughts
proceed
i
beseech
you
it
is
a
subject
on
which
i
can
not
enter
without
hesitation
a
hesitation
unworthy
of
me
stop
cried
ormond
rising
and
touching
the
bell
nothing
like
time
to
make
a
conquest
of
embarrassment
we
will
defer
this
conference
six
minutes
just
while
we
eat
our
dinner
at
the
same
moment
a
servant
entered
with
two
plates
and
the
usual
apparatus
for
dinner
on
seeing
this
she
rose
in
some
hurry
to
depart
i
thought
sir
you
were
disengaged
i
call
at
some
other
hour
he
seized
her
hand
and
held
her
from
going
but
with
an
air
by
no
means
disrespectful
nay
said
he
what
is
it
that
scares
you
away
are
you
terrified
at
the
mention
of
victuals
you
must
have
fasted
long
when
it
comes
to
that
i
told
you
true
i
am
disengaged
but
not
from
the
obligation
of
eating
and
drinking
no
doubt
have
dined
no
reason
why
should
go
without
my
dinner
if
you
do
not
choose
to
partake
with
me
so
much
the
better
your
temperance
ought
to
dispense
with
two
meals
in
an
hour
be
a
or
if
that
will
not
do
retire
into
my
library
where
in
six
minutes
i
will
be
with
you
and
lend
you
my
aid
in
the
arduous
task
of
telling
me
what
you
came
with
an
intention
of
telling
this
singular
address
disconcerted
and
abashed
her
she
was
contented
to
follow
the
servant
silently
into
an
adjoining
apartment
here
she
reflected
with
no
small
surprise
on
the
behaviour
of
this
man
though
ruffled
she
was
not
heartily
displeased
with
it
she
had
scarcely
time
to
collect
herself
when
he
entered
he
immediately
seated
her
and
himself
opposite
to
her
he
fixed
his
eyes
without
scruple
on
her
face
his
gaze
was
steadfast
but
not
insolent
or
oppressive
he
surveyed
her
with
the
looks
with
which
he
would
have
eyed
a
charming
portrait
his
attention
was
occupied
with
what
he
saw
as
that
of
an
artist
is
occupied
when
viewing
a
madonna
of
rafaello
at
length
he
broke
silence
at
dinner
i
was
busy
in
thinking
what
it
was
you
had
to
disclose
i
will
not
fatigue
you
with
my
guesses
they
would
he
impertinent
as
long
as
the
truth
is
going
to
be
disclosed
he
paused
and
then
continued
but
i
see
you
can
not
dispense
with
my
aid
perhaps
your
business
relates
to
helena
she
has
done
wrong
and
you
wish
me
to
rebuke
the
girl
constantia
profited
by
this
opening
and
said
yes
she
has
done
wrong
it
is
true
my
business
relates
to
her
i
came
hither
as
a
suppliant
in
her
behalf
will
you
not
assist
her
in
recovering
the
path
from
which
she
has
deviated
she
left
it
from
confiding
more
in
the
judgement
of
her
guide
than
her
own
there
is
one
method
of
repairing
the
evil
it
lies
with
you
to
repair
that
evil
during
this
address
the
gaiety
of
ormond
disappeared
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
constantia
with
new
and
even
pathetic
earnestness
i
guessed
as
much
said
he
i
have
often
been
deceived
in
my
judgement
of
characters
perhaps
i
do
not
comprehend
yours
yet
it
is
not
little
that
i
have
heard
respecting
you
something
i
have
seen
i
begin
to
suspect
a
material
error
in
my
theory
of
human
nature
happy
will
it
be
for
helena
if
my
suspicions
be
groundless
you
are
helena
friend
be
mine
also
and
advise
me
shall
i
marry
this
girl
or
not
you
know
on
what
terms
we
live
are
they
suitable
to
our
respective
characters
shall
i
wed
this
girl
or
shall
things
remain
as
they
are
i
have
an
irreconcilable
aversion
to
a
sad
brow
and
a
sick
bed
helena
is
grieved
because
her
neighbours
sneer
and
point
at
her
so
far
she
is
a
fool
but
that
is
a
folly
of
which
she
never
will
be
cured
marriage
it
seems
will
set
all
right
answer
me
constantia
shall
i
marry
there
was
something
in
the
tone
but
more
in
the
tenor
of
this
address
that
startled
her
there
was
nothing
in
this
man
but
what
came
upon
her
unaware
this
sudden
effusion
of
confidence
was
particularly
unexpected
and
embarrassing
she
scarcely
knew
whether
to
regard
it
as
serious
or
a
jest
on
observing
her
indisposed
to
speak
he
continued
away
with
these
impertinent
circuities
and
scruples
i
know
your
meaning
why
should
i
pretend
ignorance
and
put
you
to
the
trouble
of
explanation
you
came
hither
with
no
other
view
than
to
exact
this
question
and
furnish
an
answer
why
should
not
we
come
at
once
to
the
point
i
have
for
some
time
been
dubious
on
this
head
there
is
something
wanting
to
determine
the
balance
if
you
have
that
something
throw
it
into
the
proper
scale
you
err
if
you
think
this
manner
of
addressing
you
is
wild
or
improper
this
girl
is
the
subject
of
discourse
if
she
was
not
to
be
so
why
did
you
favour
me
with
this
visit
you
have
sought
me
and
introduced
yourself
i
have
in
like
manner
overlooked
ordinary
forms
a
negligence
that
has
been
systematic
with
me
but
in
the
present
case
particularly
justifiable
by
your
example
shame
upon
you
presumptuous
girl
to
suppose
yourself
the
only
rational
being
among
mankind
and
yet
if
you
thought
so
why
did
you
thus
unceremoniously
intrude
upon
my
retirements
this
act
is
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
it
shows
you
to
be
one
whose
existence
i
did
not
believe
possible
take
care
you
know
not
what
you
have
done
you
came
hither
as
friend
perhaps
time
may
show
that
in
this
visit
you
have
performed
the
behest
of
her
bitterest
enemy
but
that
is
out
of
season
this
girl
is
our
mutual
property
you
are
her
friend
i
am
her
lover
her
happiness
is
precious
in
my
eyes
and
in
yours
to
the
rest
of
mankind
she
is
a
noisome
weed
that
can
not
be
shunned
too
cautiously
nor
trampled
on
too
much
if
we
forsake
her
infamy
that
is
now
kept
at
bay
will
seize
upon
her
and
while
it
mangles
her
form
will
tear
from
her
her
innocence
she
has
no
arms
with
which
to
contend
against
that
foe
marriage
will
place
her
at
once
in
security
shall
it
be
you
have
an
exact
knowledge
of
her
strength
and
her
weakness
of
me
you
know
little
perhaps
before
that
question
can
be
satisfactorily
answered
it
is
requisite
to
know
the
qualities
of
her
husband
be
my
character
henceforth
the
subject
of
your
study
i
will
furnish
you
with
all
the
light
in
my
power
be
not
hasty
in
deciding
but
when
your
decision
is
formed
let
me
know
it
he
waited
for
an
answer
which
she
at
length
summoned
resolution
enough
to
give
you
have
come
to
the
chief
point
which
i
had
in
view
in
making
this
visit
to
say
truth
i
came
hither
to
remonstrate
with
you
on
withholding
that
which
helena
may
justly
claim
from
you
her
happiness
will
be
unquestionably
restored
and
increased
by
it
yours
will
not
be
impaired
matrimony
will
not
produce
any
essential
change
in
your
situation
it
will
produce
no
greater
or
different
intercourse
than
now
exists
helena
is
on
the
brink
of
a
gulf
which
i
shudder
to
look
upon
i
believe
that
you
will
not
injure
yourself
by
snatching
her
from
it
i
am
sure
that
you
will
confer
an
inexpressible
benefit
upon
her
let
me
then
persuade
you
to
do
her
and
yourself
justice
no
persuasion
said
ormond
after
recovering
from
a
fit
of
thoughtfulness
is
needful
for
this
end
i
only
want
to
be
convinced
you
have
decided
but
i
fear
hastily
by
what
inscrutable
influences
are
our
steps
guided
come
proceed
in
your
exhortations
argue
with
the
utmost
clearness
and
cogency
arm
yourself
with
all
the
irresistibles
of
eloquence
yet
you
are
building
nothing
you
are
only
demolishing
your
argument
is
one
thing
its
tendency
is
another
and
is
the
reverse
of
all
you
expect
and
desire
my
assent
will
be
refused
with
an
obstinacy
proportioned
to
the
force
that
you
exert
to
obtain
it
and
to
the
just
application
of
that
force
i
see
replied
the
lady
smiling
and
leaving
her
seat
you
can
talk
in
riddles
as
well
as
other
people
this
visit
has
been
too
long
i
shall
indeed
be
sorry
if
my
interference
instead
of
serving
my
friend
has
injured
her
i
have
acted
an
uncommon
and
as
it
may
seem
an
ambiguous
part
i
shall
be
contented
with
construing
my
motives
in
my
own
way
i
wish
you
a
good
evening
is
false
cried
he
sternly
you
do
not
wish
it
how
exclaimed
the
astonished
constantia
i
will
put
your
sincerity
to
the
test
allow
me
to
spend
this
evening
in
your
company
then
it
will
be
well
spent
and
i
shall
believe
your
wishes
sincere
else
continued
he
changing
his
affected
austerity
into
a
smile
constantia
is
a
liar
you
are
a
singular
man
i
hardly
know
how
to
understand
you
well
words
are
made
to
carry
meanings
you
shall
have
them
in
abundance
your
house
is
your
citadel
i
will
not
enter
it
without
leave
permit
me
to
visit
it
when
i
please
but
that
is
too
much
it
is
more
than
i
would
allow
you
when
will
you
permit
me
to
visit
you
i
can
not
answer
when
i
do
not
understand
you
clothe
your
thoughts
in
a
garb
so
uncouth
that
i
know
not
in
what
light
they
are
to
be
viewed
well
now
i
thought
you
understood
my
language
and
were
an
englishwoman
but
i
will
use
another
shall
i
have
the
honour
bowing
with
a
courtly
air
of
supplication
of
occasionally
paying
my
respects
to
you
at
your
own
dwelling
it
would
be
cruel
to
condemn
those
who
have
the
happiness
of
knowing
miss
dudley
to
fashionable
restraints
at
what
hour
will
she
be
least
incommoded
by
a
visitant
i
am
as
little
pleased
with
formalities
replied
the
lady
as
you
are
my
friends
i
can
not
see
too
often
they
need
to
consult
merely
their
own
convenience
those
who
are
not
my
friends
i
can
not
see
too
seldom
you
have
only
to
establish
your
title
to
that
name
and
your
welcome
at
all
times
is
sure
till
then
you
must
not
look
for
it
chapter
vi
here
ended
this
conference
she
had
by
no
means
suspected
the
manner
in
which
it
would
be
conducted
all
punctilios
were
trampled
under
foot
by
the
impetuosity
of
ormond
things
were
at
once
and
without
delay
placed
upon
a
certain
footing
the
point
which
ordinary
persons
would
have
employed
months
in
attaining
was
reached
in
a
moment
while
these
incidents
were
fresh
in
her
memory
they
were
accompanied
with
a
sort
of
trepidation
the
offspring
at
once
of
pleasure
and
surprise
ormond
had
not
deceived
her
expectations
but
hearsay
and
personal
examination
however
uniform
their
testimony
may
be
produce
a
very
different
impression
in
her
present
reflections
helena
and
her
lover
approached
to
the
front
of
the
stage
and
were
viewed
with
equal
perspicuity
one
consequence
of
this
was
that
their
characters
were
more
powerfully
contrasted
with
each
other
and
the
eligibility
of
marriage
appeared
not
quite
so
incontestable
as
before
was
not
equality
implied
in
this
compact
marriage
is
an
instrument
of
pleasure
or
pain
in
proportion
as
this
equality
is
more
or
less
what
but
the
fascination
of
his
senses
is
it
that
ties
ormond
to
helena
is
this
a
basis
en
which
marriage
may
properly
be
built
if
things
had
not
gone
thus
far
the
impropriety
of
marriage
could
not
be
doubted
but
at
present
there
is
a
choice
of
evils
and
that
may
now
be
desirable
which
at
a
former
period
and
in
different
circumstances
would
have
been
clearly
otherwise
the
evils
of
the
present
connection
are
known
those
of
marriage
are
future
and
contingent
helena
can
not
be
the
object
of
a
genuine
and
lasting
passion
another
may
this
is
not
merely
possible
nothing
is
more
likely
to
happen
this
event
therefore
ought
to
be
included
in
our
calculation
there
would
be
a
material
deficiency
without
it
what
was
the
amount
of
the
misery
that
would
in
this
case
ensue
constantia
was
qualified
beyond
most
others
to
form
an
adequate
conception
of
this
misery
one
of
the
ingredients
in
her
character
was
a
mild
and
steadfast
enthusiasm
her
sensibilities
to
social
pleasure
and
her
conceptions
of
the
benefits
to
flow
from
the
conformity
and
concurrence
of
intentions
and
wishes
heightening
and
refining
the
sensual
passion
were
exquisite
there
indeed
were
evils
the
foresight
of
which
tended
to
prevent
them
but
was
there
wisdom
in
creating
obstacles
in
the
way
of
a
suitable
alliance
before
we
act
we
must
consider
not
only
the
misery
produced
but
the
happiness
precluded
by
our
measures
in
no
case
perhaps
is
the
decision
of
a
human
being
impartial
or
totally
uninfluenced
by
sinister
and
selfish
motives
if
constantia
surpassed
others
it
was
not
because
her
motives
were
pure
but
because
they
possessed
more
of
purity
than
those
of
others
sinister
considerations
flow
in
upon
us
through
imperceptible
channels
and
modify
our
thoughts
in
numberless
ways
without
our
being
truly
conscious
of
their
presence
constantia
was
young
and
her
heart
was
open
at
a
thousand
pores
to
the
love
of
excellence
the
image
of
ormond
occupied
the
chief
place
in
her
fancy
and
was
endowed
with
attractive
and
venerable
qualities
a
bias
was
hence
created
that
swayed
her
thoughts
though
she
knew
not
that
they
were
swayed
to
this
might
justly
be
imputed
some
part
of
that
reluctance
which
she
now
felt
to
give
ormond
to
helena
but
this
was
not
sufficient
to
turn
the
scale
that
which
had
previously
mounted
was
indeed
heavier
than
before
but
this
addition
did
not
enable
it
to
outweigh
its
opposite
marriage
was
still
the
best
upon
the
whole
but
her
heart
was
tortured
to
think
that
best
as
it
was
it
abounded
with
so
many
evils
on
the
evening
of
the
next
day
ormond
entered
with
careless
abruptness
constantia
he
was
introduced
to
her
father
a
general
and
unrestrained
conversation
immediately
took
place
ormond
addressed
dudley
with
the
familiarity
of
an
old
acquaintance
in
three
minutes
all
embarrassment
was
discarded
the
lady
and
her
visitant
were
accurate
observers
of
each
other
in
the
remarks
of
the
latter
and
his
vein
was
an
abundant
one
there
was
a
freedom
and
originality
altogether
new
to
his
hearers
in
his
easiest
and
sprightliest
sallies
were
tokens
of
a
mind
habituated
to
profound
and
extensive
views
his
associations
were
forced
on
a
comprehensive
scale
he
pretended
to
nothing
and
studied
the
concealments
of
ambiguity
more
in
reality
than
in
appearance
constantia
however
discovered
a
sufficient
resemblance
between
their
theories
of
virtue
and
duty
the
difference
between
them
lay
in
the
inferences
arbitrarily
deduced
and
in
which
two
persons
may
vary
without
end
and
yet
never
be
repugnant
constantia
delighted
her
companions
by
the
facility
with
which
she
entered
into
his
meaning
the
sagacity
she
displayed
in
drawing
out
his
hints
circumscribing
his
conjectures
and
thwarting
or
qualifying
his
maxims
the
scene
was
generally
replete
with
ardour
and
contention
and
yet
the
impression
left
on
the
mind
of
ormond
was
full
of
harmony
her
discourse
tended
to
rouse
him
from
his
lethargy
to
furnish
him
with
powerful
excitements
and
the
time
spent
in
her
company
seemed
like
a
doubling
of
existence
the
comparison
could
not
but
suggest
itself
between
this
scene
and
that
exhibited
by
helena
with
the
latter
voluptuous
blandishments
musical
prattle
and
silent
but
expressive
homage
composed
a
banquet
delicious
fur
awhile
but
whose
sweetness
now
began
to
pall
upon
his
taste
it
supplied
him
with
no
new
ideas
and
hindered
him
by
the
lulling
sensations
it
inspired
from
profiting
by
his
former
acquisitions
helena
was
beautiful
apply
the
scale
and
not
a
member
was
found
inelegantly
disposed
or
negligently
moulded
not
a
curve
that
was
blemished
by
an
angle
or
ruffled
by
asperities
the
irradiations
of
her
eyes
were
able
to
dissolve
the
knottiest
fibres
and
their
azure
was
serene
beyond
any
that
nature
had
elsewhere
exhibited
over
the
rest
of
her
form
the
glistening
and
rosy
hues
were
diffused
with
prodigal
luxuriance
and
mingled
in
endless
and
wanton
variety
yet
this
image
had
fewer
attractions
even
to
the
senses
than
that
of
constantia
so
great
is
the
difference
between
forms
animated
by
different
degrees
of
intelligence
the
interviews
of
ormond
and
constantia
grew
more
frequent
the
progress
which
they
made
in
acknowledgement
of
each
other
was
rapid
two
positions
that
were
favourite
ones
with
him
were
quickly
subverted
he
was
suddenly
changed
from
being
one
of
the
calumniators
of
the
female
sex
to
one
of
its
warmest
eulogists
this
was
a
point
on
which
constantia
had
ever
been
a
vigorous
disputant
but
her
arguments
in
their
direct
tendency
would
never
have
made
a
convert
of
this
man
their
force
intrinsically
considered
was
nothing
he
drew
his
conclusions
from
incidental
circumstances
her
reasonings
might
be
fallacious
or
valid
but
they
were
composed
arranged
and
delivered
were
drawn
from
such
sources
and
accompanied
with
such
illustrations
as
plainly
testified
a
manlike
energy
in
the
reasoner
in
this
indirect
and
circuitous
way
her
point
was
unanswerably
established
your
reasoning
is
bad
he
would
say
every
one
of
your
conclusions
is
false
not
a
single
allegation
but
may
be
easily
confuted
and
yet
i
allow
that
your
position
is
incontrovertibly
proved
by
them
how
bewildered
is
that
man
who
never
thinks
for
himself
who
rejects
a
principle
merely
because
the
arguments
brought
in
support
of
it
are
insufficient
i
must
not
reject
the
truth
because
another
has
unjustifiably
adopted
it
i
want
to
reach
a
certain
another
has
reached
it
before
me
but
the
ladder
he
used
is
too
weak
to
bear
me
what
then
am
i
to
stay
below
on
that
account
no
i
have
only
to
construct
one
suitable
to
the
purpose
and
of
strength
sufficient
a
second
maxim
had
never
been
confuted
till
now
it
inculcated
the
insignificance
and
hollowness
of
love
no
pleasure
he
thought
was
to
be
despised
for
its
own
sake
every
thing
was
good
in
its
place
but
amorous
gratifications
were
to
be
degraded
to
the
bottom
of
the
catalogue
the
enjoyments
of
music
and
landscape
were
of
a
much
higher
order
epicurism
itself
was
entitled
to
more
respect
love
in
itself
was
in
his
opinion
of
little
worth
and
only
of
importance
as
the
source
of
the
most
terrible
of
intellectual
maladies
sexual
sensations
associating
themselves
in
a
certain
way
with
our
ideas
beget
a
disease
which
has
indeed
found
no
place
in
the
catalogue
but
is
a
case
of
more
entire
subversion
and
confusion
of
mind
than
any
other
the
victim
is
callous
to
the
sentiments
of
honour
and
shame
insensible
to
the
most
palpable
distinctions
of
right
and
wrong
a
systematic
opponent
of
testimony
and
obstinate
perverter
of
truth
ormond
was
partly
right
madness
like
death
can
be
averted
by
no
foresight
or
previous
contrivance
this
probably
is
one
of
its
characteristics
he
that
witnesses
its
influence
on
another
with
most
horror
and
most
fervently
deprecates
its
ravages
is
not
therefore
more
safe
this
circumstance
was
realized
in
the
history
of
ormond
this
infatuation
if
it
may
so
be
called
was
gradual
in
its
progress
the
sensations
which
helena
was
now
able
to
excite
were
of
a
new
kind
her
power
was
not
merely
weakened
but
her
endeavours
counteracted
their
own
end
her
fondness
was
rejected
with
disdain
or
borne
with
reluctance
the
lady
was
not
slow
in
perceiving
this
change
the
stroke
of
death
would
have
been
more
acceptable
his
own
reflections
were
too
tormenting
to
make
him
willing
to
discuss
them
in
words
he
was
not
aware
of
the
effects
produced
by
this
change
in
his
demeanour
till
informed
of
it
by
herself
one
evening
he
displayed
symptoms
of
uncommon
dissatisfaction
her
tenderness
was
unable
to
dispel
it
he
complained
of
want
of
sleep
this
afforded
a
hint
which
she
drew
forth
in
one
of
her
enchanting
ditties
habit
had
almost
conferred
upon
her
the
power
of
spontaneous
poesy
and
while
she
pressed
his
forehead
to
her
bosom
she
warbled
forth
a
strain
airy
and
exuberant
in
numbers
tender
and
ecstatic
in
its
imagery
sleep
extend
thy
downy
pinion
hasten
from
thy
cell
with
speed
spread
around
thy
soft
dominion
much
those
brows
thy
balmy
presence
need
wave
thy
wand
of
slumberous
power
moistened
in
lethean
dews
to
charm
the
busy
spirits
of
the
hour
and
brighten
memory
malignant
hues
thy
mantle
dark
and
starless
cast
over
my
selected
youth
bury
in
thy
womb
the
mournful
past
and
soften
with
thy
dreams
th
asperities
of
truth
the
changeful
hues
of
his
impassioned
sleep
my
office
it
shall
be
to
watch
the
while
with
thee
my
love
when
fancy
prompts
to
weep
and
when
thou
to
smile
but
sleep
i
charge
thee
visit
not
these
eyes
nor
raise
thy
dark
pavilion
here
morrow
from
the
cave
of
ocean
arise
and
whisper
tuneful
joy
in
nature
ear
but
mutely
let
me
lie
and
sateless
gaze
at
all
the
soul
that
in
his
visage
sits
while
spirits
of
harmonious
air
here
her
voice
sunk
and
the
line
terminated
in
a
sigh
her
museful
ardours
were
chilled
by
the
looks
of
ormond
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
he
appeared
scarcely
to
attend
to
this
strain
his
sternness
was
proof
against
her
accustomed
fascinations
at
length
she
pathetically
complained
of
his
coldness
and
insinuated
her
suspicions
that
his
affection
was
transferred
to
another
object
he
started
from
her
embrace
and
after
two
or
three
turns
across
the
room
he
stood
before
her
his
large
eyes
were
steadfastly
fixed
upon
her
face
aye
said
he
thou
hast
guessed
right
the
love
poor
as
it
was
that
i
had
for
thee
is
gone
henceforth
thou
art
desolate
indeed
would
to
god
thou
wert
wise
thy
woes
are
but
beginning
i
fear
they
will
terminate
fatally
if
so
the
catastrophe
can
not
come
too
quickly
i
disdain
to
appeal
to
thy
justice
helena
to
remind
thee
of
conditions
solemnly
and
explicitly
assumed
shall
thy
blood
be
upon
thy
own
head
no
i
will
bear
it
myself
though
the
load
would
crush
a
mountain
i
will
bear
it
i
can
not
help
it
i
make
not
myself
i
am
moulded
by
circumstances
whether
i
shall
love
thee
or
not
is
no
longer
in
my
own
choice
marriage
if
indeed
still
in
my
power
i
may
give
thee
any
name
and
share
with
thee
my
fortune
will
these
content
thee
thou
canst
not
partake
of
my
love
thou
canst
have
no
part
in
my
tenderness
these
are
reserved
for
another
more
worthy
than
thou
but
no
thy
state
is
to
the
last
degree
forlorn
even
marriage
is
denied
thee
thou
wast
contented
to
take
me
without
it
to
dispense
with
the
name
of
wife
but
the
being
who
has
displaced
thy
image
in
thy
heart
is
of
a
different
class
she
will
be
to
me
a
wife
or
nothing
and
i
must
be
her
husband
or
perish
do
not
deceive
thyself
helena
i
know
what
it
is
in
which
thou
hast
placed
thy
felicity
life
is
worth
retaining
by
thee
but
on
one
condition
i
know
the
incurableness
of
thy
infirmity
but
be
not
deceived
thy
happiness
is
ravished
from
thee
the
condition
on
which
thou
consentedst
to
live
is
annulled
i
love
thee
no
longer
no
truth
was
ever
more
delicious
none
was
ever
more
detestable
i
fight
against
conviction
and
i
cling
to
it
that
i
love
thee
no
longer
is
at
once
a
subject
of
joy
and
of
mourning
i
struggle
to
believe
thee
superior
to
this
shock
that
thou
wilt
be
happy
though
deserted
by
me
whatever
be
thy
destiny
my
reason
will
not
allow
me
to
be
miserable
on
that
account
yet
i
would
give
the
world
i
would
forfeit
every
claim
but
that
which
i
hope
upon
the
heart
of
constantia
to
be
sure
that
thy
tranquillity
will
survive
this
stroke
but
let
come
what
will
look
no
longer
to
me
for
offices
of
love
henceforth
all
intercourse
of
tenderness
ceases
perhaps
all
personal
intercourse
whatever
but
though
this
good
be
refused
thou
art
sure
of
independence
i
will
guard
thy
ease
and
thy
honour
with
a
scrupulousness
would
to
heaven
a
sister
could
be
created
by
adoption
i
am
willing
for
thy
sake
to
be
an
impostor
i
will
own
thee
to
the
world
for
my
sister
and
carry
thee
whither
the
cheat
shall
never
be
detected
i
would
devote
my
whole
life
to
prevarication
and
falsehood
for
thy
sake
if
that
would
suffice
to
make
thee
happy
to
this
speech
helena
had
nothing
to
answer
her
sobs
and
tears
choked
all
utterance
she
hid
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
and
sat
powerless
and
overwhelmed
with
despair
ormond
traversed
the
room
uneasily
sometimes
moving
to
and
fro
with
quick
steps
sometimes
standing
and
eyeing
her
with
looks
of
compassion
at
length
he
spoke
it
is
time
to
leave
you
this
is
the
first
night
that
you
will
spend
in
dreary
solitude
i
know
it
will
be
sleepless
and
full
of
agony
but
the
sentence
can
not
be
recalled
henceforth
regard
me
as
a
brother
i
will
prove
myself
one
all
other
claims
are
swallowed
up
in
a
superior
affection
in
saying
this
he
left
the
house
and
almost
without
intending
it
found
himself
in
a
few
minutes
at
dudley
door
chapter
vii
the
politeness
of
melbourne
had
somewhat
abated
dudley
aversion
to
society
he
allowed
himself
sometimes
to
comply
with
urgent
invitations
on
this
evening
he
happened
to
be
at
the
house
of
that
gentleman
ormond
entered
and
found
constantia
alone
an
interview
of
this
kind
was
seldom
enjoyed
though
earnestly
wished
for
by
constantia
who
was
eager
to
renew
the
subject
of
her
first
conversation
with
ormond
i
have
already
explained
the
situation
of
her
mind
all
her
wishes
were
concentred
in
the
marriage
of
helena
the
eligibility
of
this
scheme
in
every
view
which
she
took
of
it
appeared
in
a
stronger
light
she
was
not
aware
that
any
new
obstacle
had
arisen
she
was
free
from
the
consciousness
of
any
secret
bias
much
less
did
her
modesty
suspect
that
she
herself
would
prove
an
insuperable
impediment
to
this
plan
there
was
more
than
usual
solemnity
in
ormond
demeanour
after
he
was
seated
he
continued
contrary
to
his
custom
to
be
silent
these
singularities
were
not
unobserved
by
constantia
they
did
not
however
divert
her
from
her
purpose
i
am
glad
to
see
you
said
she
we
so
seldom
enjoy
the
advantage
of
a
private
interview
i
have
much
to
say
to
you
you
authorize
me
to
deliberate
on
your
actions
and
in
some
measure
to
prescribe
to
you
this
is
a
province
which
i
hope
to
discharge
with
integrity
and
diligence
i
am
convinced
that
helena
happiness
and
your
own
can
be
secured
in
one
way
only
i
will
emulate
your
candour
and
come
at
once
to
the
point
why
have
you
delayed
so
long
the
justice
that
is
due
to
this
helpless
and
lovely
girl
there
are
a
thousand
reasons
why
you
should
think
of
no
other
alternative
you
have
been
pleased
to
repose
some
degree
of
confidence
in
my
judgement
hear
my
full
and
deliberate
opinion
make
helena
your
wife
this
is
the
unequivocal
prescription
of
your
duty
this
address
was
heard
by
ormond
without
surprise
but
his
countenance
betrayed
the
acuteness
of
his
feelings
the
bitterness
that
overflowed
his
heart
was
perceptible
in
his
tone
when
he
spoke
most
egregiously
are
you
deceived
such
is
the
line
with
which
human
capacity
presumes
to
fathom
futurity
with
all
your
discernment
you
do
not
see
that
marriage
would
effectually
destroy
me
you
do
not
see
that
whether
beneficial
or
otherwise
in
its
effects
marriage
is
impossible
you
are
merely
prompting
me
to
suicide
but
how
shall
i
inflict
the
wound
where
is
the
weapon
see
you
not
that
i
am
powerless
leap
say
you
into
the
flames
see
you
not
that
i
am
fettered
will
a
mountain
move
at
your
bidding
sooner
than
i
in
the
path
which
you
prescribe
to
me
this
speech
was
inexplicable
she
pressed
him
to
speak
less
enigmatically
had
he
formed
his
resolution
if
so
arguments
and
remonstrances
were
superfluous
without
noticing
her
interrogatories
he
continued
i
am
too
hasty
in
condemning
you
you
judge
not
against
but
without
knowledge
when
sufficiently
informed
your
decision
will
be
right
yet
how
can
you
be
ignorant
can
you
for
a
moment
contemplate
yourself
and
me
and
not
perceive
an
insuperable
bar
to
this
union
you
place
me
said
constantia
in
a
very
disagreeable
predicament
i
have
not
deserved
this
treatment
from
you
this
is
an
unjustifiable
deviation
from
plain
dealing
of
what
impediment
do
you
speak
i
can
safely
say
that
i
know
of
none
well
resumed
he
with
augmented
eagerness
i
must
supply
you
with
knowledge
i
repeat
that
i
perfectly
rely
on
the
rectitude
of
your
judgement
summon
all
your
sagacity
and
disinterestedness
and
choose
for
me
you
know
in
what
light
helena
has
been
viewed
by
me
i
have
ceased
to
view
her
in
this
light
she
has
become
an
object
of
indifference
nay
i
am
not
certain
that
i
do
not
hate
her
not
indeed
for
her
own
sake
but
because
i
love
another
shall
i
marry
her
whom
i
hate
when
there
exists
one
whom
i
love
with
unconquerable
ardour
constantia
was
thunderstruck
with
this
intelligence
she
looked
at
him
with
some
expression
of
doubt
how
is
this
said
she
why
did
you
not
tell
me
this
before
when
i
last
talked
with
you
on
this
subject
i
knew
it
not
myself
it
has
occurred
since
i
have
seized
the
first
occasion
that
has
offered
to
inform
you
of
it
say
now
since
such
is
my
condition
ought
helena
to
be
my
wife
constantia
was
silent
her
heart
bled
for
what
she
foresaw
would
be
the
sufferings
and
forlorn
destiny
of
helena
she
had
not
courage
to
inquire
further
into
this
new
engagement
i
wait
for
your
answer
constantia
shall
i
defraud
myself
of
all
the
happiness
which
would
accrue
from
a
match
of
inclination
shall
i
put
fetters
on
my
usefulness
this
is
the
style
in
which
you
speak
shall
i
preclude
all
the
good
to
others
that
would
flow
from
a
suitable
alliance
shall
i
abjure
the
woman
i
love
and
marry
her
whom
i
hate
hatred
replied
the
lady
is
a
harsh
word
helena
has
not
deserved
that
you
should
hate
her
i
own
this
is
a
perplexing
circumstance
it
would
be
wrong
to
determine
hastily
suppose
you
give
yourself
to
helena
will
more
than
yourself
be
injured
by
it
who
is
this
lady
will
she
be
rendered
unhappy
by
a
determination
in
favour
of
another
this
is
a
point
of
the
utmost
importance
at
these
words
ormond
forsook
his
seat
and
advanced
close
up
to
constantia
you
say
true
this
is
a
point
of
inexpressible
importance
it
would
be
presumption
in
me
to
decide
that
is
the
lady
own
province
and
now
say
truly
are
you
willing
to
accept
ormond
with
all
his
faults
who
but
yourself
could
be
mistress
of
all
the
springs
of
my
soul
i
know
the
sternness
of
your
probity
this
discovery
will
only
make
you
more
strenuously
the
friend
of
helena
yet
why
should
you
not
shun
either
extreme
lay
yourself
out
of
view
and
yet
perhaps
the
happiness
of
constantia
is
not
unconcerned
in
this
question
is
there
no
part
of
me
in
which
you
discover
your
own
likeness
am
i
deceived
or
is
it
an
incontrollable
destiny
that
unites
us
this
declaration
was
truly
unexpected
by
constantia
she
gathered
from
it
nothing
but
excitements
of
grief
after
some
pause
she
said
this
appeal
to
me
has
made
no
change
in
my
opinion
i
still
think
that
justice
requires
you
to
become
the
husband
of
helena
as
to
me
do
you
think
my
happiness
rests
upon
so
slight
a
foundation
i
can
not
love
but
when
my
understanding
points
out
to
me
the
propriety
of
love
ever
since
i
have
known
you
i
have
looked
upon
you
as
rightfully
belonging
to
another
love
could
not
take
place
in
my
circumstances
yet
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
my
sentiments
i
am
not
sure
that
in
different
circumstances
i
should
not
have
loved
i
am
acquainted
with
your
worth
i
do
not
look
for
a
faultless
man
i
have
met
with
none
whose
blemishes
were
fewer
it
matters
not
however
what
i
should
have
been
i
can
not
interfere
in
this
case
with
the
claims
of
my
friend
i
have
no
passion
to
struggle
with
i
hope
in
every
vicissitude
to
enjoy
your
esteem
and
nothing
more
there
is
but
one
way
in
which
mine
can
be
secured
and
that
is
by
espousing
this
unhappy
girl
no
exclaimed
ormond
require
not
impossibilities
helena
can
never
be
any
thing
to
me
i
should
with
unspeakably
more
willingness
assail
my
own
life
what
said
the
lady
will
helena
think
of
this
sudden
and
dreadful
change
i
can
not
bear
to
think
upon
the
feelings
that
this
information
will
excite
she
knows
it
already
i
have
this
moment
left
her
i
explained
to
her
in
a
few
words
my
motives
and
assured
her
of
my
unalterable
resolution
i
have
vowed
never
to
see
her
more
but
as
a
brother
and
this
vow
she
has
just
heard
constantia
could
not
suppress
her
astonishment
and
compassion
at
this
intelligence
no
surely
you
could
not
be
so
cruel
and
this
was
done
with
your
usual
abruptness
i
suppose
precipitate
and
implacable
man
can
not
you
foresee
the
effects
of
this
madness
you
have
planted
a
dagger
in
her
heart
you
have
disappointed
me
i
did
not
think
you
could
act
so
inhumanly
nay
beloved
constantia
be
not
so
liberal
of
your
reproaches
would
you
have
me
deceive
her
she
must
shortly
have
known
it
could
the
truth
be
told
too
soon
much
too
soon
replied
the
lady
fervently
i
have
always
condemned
the
maxims
by
which
you
act
your
scheme
is
headlong
and
barbarous
could
not
you
regard
with
some
little
compassion
that
love
that
sacrificed
for
your
unworthy
sake
honest
fame
and
the
peace
of
virtue
is
she
not
a
poor
outcast
goaded
by
compunction
and
hooted
at
by
a
malignant
and
misjudging
world
and
who
was
it
that
reduced
her
to
this
deplorable
condition
for
whose
sake
did
she
willingly
consent
to
brave
evils
by
which
the
stoutest
heart
is
appalled
did
this
argue
no
greatness
of
mind
who
ever
surpassed
her
in
fidelity
and
tenderness
but
thus
has
she
been
rewarded
i
shudder
to
think
what
may
be
the
event
her
courage
can
not
possibly
support
her
against
treatment
so
harsh
so
perversely
and
wantonly
cruel
heaven
grant
that
you
are
not
shortly
made
bitterly
to
lament
this
rashness
ormond
was
penetrated
with
these
reproaches
they
persuaded
him
for
a
moment
that
his
deed
was
wrong
that
he
had
not
unfolded
his
intentions
to
helena
with
a
suitable
degree
of
gentleness
and
caution
little
more
was
said
on
this
occasion
constantia
exhorted
him
in
the
most
earnest
and
pathetic
manner
to
return
and
recant
or
extenuate
his
former
declarations
he
could
not
be
brought
to
promise
compliance
when
he
parted
from
her
however
he
was
half
resolved
to
act
as
she
advised
solitary
reflection
made
him
change
this
resolution
and
he
returned
to
his
own
house
during
the
night
he
did
little
else
than
ruminate
on
the
events
of
the
preceding
evening
he
entertained
little
doubt
of
his
ultimate
success
with
constantia
she
gratified
him
in
nothing
but
left
him
every
thing
to
hope
she
had
hitherto
it
seems
regarded
him
with
indifference
but
this
had
been
sufficiently
explained
that
conduct
would
be
pursued
and
that
passion
be
entertained
which
her
judgement
should
previously
approve
what
then
was
the
obstacle
it
originated
in
the
claims
of
helena
but
what
were
these
claims
it
was
fully
ascertained
that
he
should
never
be
united
to
this
girl
if
so
the
end
contemplated
by
constantia
and
for
the
sake
of
which
only
his
application
was
rejected
could
never
be
obtained
unless
her
rejection
of
him
could
procure
a
husband
for
her
friend
it
would
on
her
own
principles
be
improper
and
superfluous
what
was
to
be
done
with
helena
it
was
a
terrible
alternative
to
which
he
was
reduced
to
marry
her
or
see
her
perish
but
was
this
alternative
quite
sure
could
not
she
by
time
or
by
judicious
treatment
be
reconciled
to
her
lot
it
was
to
be
feared
that
he
had
not
made
a
suitable
beginning
and
yet
perhaps
it
was
most
expedient
that
a
hasty
and
abrupt
sentence
should
be
succeeded
by
forbearance
and
lenity
he
regretted
his
precipitation
and
though
unused
to
the
melting
mood
tears
were
wrung
from
him
by
the
idea
of
the
misery
which
he
had
probably
occasioned
he
was
determined
to
repair
his
misconduct
as
speedily
as
possible
and
to
pay
her
a
conciliating
visit
the
next
morning
he
went
early
to
her
house
he
was
informed
by
the
servant
that
her
mistress
had
not
yet
risen
was
it
usual
he
asked
for
her
to
lie
so
late
no
he
was
answered
she
never
knew
it
happen
before
but
she
supposed
her
mistress
was
not
well
she
was
just
going
into
her
chamber
to
see
what
was
the
matter
why
said
ormond
do
you
suppose
that
she
is
sick
she
was
poorly
last
night
about
nine
she
sent
out
for
some
physic
to
make
her
sleep
to
make
her
sleep
exclaimed
ormond
in
a
fettering
and
affrighted
accent
yes
she
said
she
wanted
it
for
that
so
i
went
to
the
when
i
came
back
she
was
very
poorly
indeed
i
asked
her
if
i
might
not
sit
up
with
her
she
said
do
not
want
anybody
you
may
go
to
bed
as
soon
as
you
please
and
tell
fabian
to
do
the
same
i
shall
not
want
you
again
what
did
you
buy
some
kind
of
water
i
think
they
call
it
she
wrote
it
down
and
i
carried
the
paper
to
eckhart
and
he
gave
it
to
me
in
a
bottle
and
i
gave
it
to
my
mistress
is
well
retire
i
will
see
how
she
is
myself
ormond
had
conceived
himself
fortified
against
every
disaster
he
looked
for
nothing
but
evil
and
therefore
in
ordinary
cases
regarded
its
approach
without
fear
or
surprise
now
however
he
found
that
his
tremors
would
not
be
stilled
his
perturbations
increased
with
every
step
that
brought
him
nearer
to
her
chamber
he
knocked
but
no
answer
was
returned
he
opened
the
door
advanced
to
the
bed
side
and
drew
back
the
curtains
he
shrunk
from
the
spectacle
that
presented
itself
was
this
the
helena
that
a
few
hours
before
was
blithesome
with
health
and
radiant
with
beauty
her
visage
was
serene
but
sunken
and
pale
death
was
in
every
line
of
it
to
his
tremulous
and
hurried
scrutiny
every
limb
was
rigid
and
cold
the
habits
of
ormond
tended
to
obscure
the
appearances
if
not
to
deaden
the
emotions
of
sorrow
he
was
so
much
accustomed
to
the
frustration
of
efforts
and
confided
so
much
in
his
own
integrity
that
he
was
not
easily
disconcerted
he
had
merely
to
advert
on
this
occasion
to
the
tumultuous
state
of
his
feelings
in
order
to
banish
their
confusion
and
restore
himself
to
calm
well
said
he
as
he
dropped
the
curtain
and
turned
towards
another
part
of
the
room
this
without
doubt
is
a
rueful
spectacle
can
it
be
helped
is
there
in
man
the
power
of
recalling
her
there
is
none
such
in
me
she
is
gone
well
then
she
gone
if
she
were
fool
enough
to
die
i
am
not
fool
enough
to
follow
her
i
am
determined
to
live
and
be
happy
notwithstanding
why
not
yet
this
is
a
piteous
night
what
is
impossible
to
undo
might
be
easily
prevented
a
piteous
spectacle
but
what
else
on
an
ampler
scale
is
the
universe
nature
is
a
theatre
of
suffering
what
corner
is
unvisited
by
calamity
and
pain
i
have
chosen
as
became
me
i
would
rather
precede
thee
to
the
grave
than
live
to
be
thy
husband
thou
hast
done
my
work
for
me
thou
hast
saved
thyself
and
me
from
a
thousand
evils
thou
hast
acted
as
seemed
to
thee
best
and
i
am
satisfied
hast
thou
decided
erroneously
they
that
know
thee
need
not
marvel
at
that
endless
have
been
the
proofs
of
thy
frailty
in
favour
of
this
last
act
something
may
be
said
it
is
the
last
thou
wilt
ever
commit
others
only
will
experience
its
effects
thou
hast
at
least
provided
for
thy
own
safety
but
what
is
here
a
letter
for
me
had
thy
understanding
been
as
prompt
as
thy
fingers
i
could
have
borne
with
thee
i
can
easily
divine
the
contents
of
this
epistle
he
opened
it
and
found
the
tenor
to
be
as
follows
you
did
not
use
my
dear
friend
to
part
with
me
in
this
manner
you
never
before
treated
me
so
roughly
i
am
sorry
indeed
i
am
that
i
ever
offended
you
could
you
suppose
that
i
intended
it
and
if
you
knew
that
i
meant
not
offence
why
did
you
take
offence
i
very
unhappy
for
i
have
lost
you
my
friend
you
will
never
see
me
more
you
say
that
is
very
hard
i
have
deserved
it
but
i
do
not
know
how
it
has
happened
nobody
more
desired
to
please
than
i
have
done
morning
noon
night
it
was
my
only
study
but
you
will
love
me
no
more
you
will
see
me
no
more
forgive
me
my
friend
but
i
must
say
it
is
very
hard
you
said
rightly
i
do
not
wish
to
live
without
my
friend
i
have
spent
my
life
happily
heretofore
is
true
these
have
been
transient
uneasinesses
but
your
love
was
a
reward
and
a
cure
for
every
thing
i
desired
nothing
better
in
this
world
did
you
ever
hear
me
murmur
no
i
was
not
so
unjust
my
lot
was
happy
infinitely
beyond
my
deserving
i
merited
not
to
be
loved
by
you
oh
that
i
had
suitable
words
to
express
my
gratitude
for
your
kindness
but
this
last
meeting
how
different
from
that
which
went
before
yet
even
then
there
was
something
on
your
brow
like
discontent
which
i
could
not
warble
nor
whisper
away
as
i
used
to
do
but
sad
as
this
was
it
was
nothing
like
the
last
could
ormond
be
so
stern
and
so
terrible
you
knew
that
i
would
die
but
you
need
not
have
talked
as
if
i
were
in
the
way
and
as
if
you
had
rather
i
should
die
than
live
but
one
thing
i
rejoice
at
i
am
a
poor
silly
girl
but
constantia
is
a
noble
and
accomplished
one
most
joyfully
do
i
resign
you
to
her
my
dear
friend
you
say
you
love
her
she
need
not
be
afraid
of
accepting
you
there
will
be
no
danger
of
your
preferring
another
to
her
it
was
very
natural
and
very
right
for
you
to
prefer
her
to
me
she
and
you
will
be
happy
in
each
other
it
is
this
that
sweetens
the
cup
i
am
going
to
drink
never
did
i
go
to
sleep
with
more
than
i
now
go
to
death
fare
you
well
my
dear
friend
this
letter
was
calculated
to
make
a
deeper
impression
on
ormond
than
even
the
sight
of
helena
corpse
it
was
in
vain
for
some
time
that
he
endeavoured
to
reconcile
himself
to
this
event
it
was
seldom
that
he
was
able
to
forget
it
he
was
obliged
to
exert
all
his
energies
to
enable
him
to
support
the
remembrance
the
task
was
of
course
rendered
easier
by
time
it
was
immediately
requisite
to
attend
to
the
disposal
of
the
corpse
he
felt
himself
unfit
for
this
mournful
office
he
was
willing
to
relieve
himself
from
it
by
any
expedient
helena
next
neighbour
was
an
old
lady
whose
scruples
made
her
shun
all
direct
intercourse
with
this
unhappy
girl
yet
she
had
performed
many
acts
of
neighbourly
kindness
she
readily
obeyed
the
summons
of
ormond
on
this
occasion
to
take
charge
of
affairs
till
another
should
assert
it
ormond
returned
home
and
sent
the
following
note
to
constantia
you
have
predicted
aright
helena
is
dead
in
a
mind
like
every
grief
will
be
suspended
and
every
regard
absorbed
in
the
attention
due
to
the
remains
of
this
unfortunate
girl
can
not
attend
to
them
constantia
was
extremely
shocked
by
this
intelligence
but
she
was
not
unmindful
of
her
duty
she
prepared
herself
with
mournful
alacrity
for
the
performance
of
it
every
thing
that
the
occasion
demanded
was
done
with
diligence
and
care
till
this
was
accomplished
ormond
could
not
prevail
upon
himself
to
appear
upon
the
stage
he
was
informed
of
this
by
a
note
from
constantia
who
requested
him
to
take
possession
of
the
unoccupied
dwelling
and
its
furniture
among
the
terms
of
his
contract
with
helena
ormond
had
voluntarily
inserted
the
exclusive
property
of
a
house
and
its
furniture
in
this
city
with
funds
adequate
to
her
plentiful
maintenance
these
he
had
purchased
and
transferred
to
her
to
this
he
had
afterwards
added
a
rural
retreat
in
the
midst
of
spacious
and
fields
three
miles
from
and
seated
on
the
right
bank
of
the
sound
it
is
proper
to
mention
that
this
farm
was
formerly
the
property
of
dudley
had
been
fitted
up
by
him
and
used
as
his
summer
abode
during
his
prosperity
in
the
division
of
his
property
it
had
fallen
to
one
of
his
creditors
from
whom
it
had
been
purchased
by
ormond
this
circumstance
in
conjunction
with
the
love
which
she
bore
to
constantia
had
suggested
to
helena
a
scheme
which
her
want
of
foresight
would
in
different
circumstances
have
occasioned
her
to
overlook
it
was
that
of
making
her
testament
by
which
she
bequeathed
all
that
she
possessed
to
her
friend
this
was
not
done
without
the
knowledge
and
cheerful
concurrence
of
ormond
who
together
with
melbourne
and
another
respectable
citizen
were
named
executors
melbourne
and
his
friend
were
induced
by
their
respect
for
constantia
to
consent
to
this
nomination
this
had
taken
place
before
ormond
and
constantia
had
been
introduced
to
each
other
after
this
event
ormond
had
sometimes
been
employed
in
contriving
means
for
securing
to
his
new
friend
and
her
father
a
subsistence
more
certain
than
the
will
of
helena
could
afford
her
death
he
considered
as
an
event
equally
remote
and
undesirable
this
event
however
unexpectedly
had
now
happened
and
precluded
the
necessity
of
further
consideration
on
this
head
constantia
could
not
but
accept
this
bequest
had
it
been
her
wish
to
decline
it
it
was
not
in
her
power
but
she
justly
regarded
the
leisure
and
independence
thus
conferred
upon
her
as
inestimable
benefits
it
was
a
source
of
unbounded
satisfaction
on
her
account
who
was
once
more
seated
in
the
bosom
of
affluence
perhaps
in
a
rational
estimate
one
of
the
most
fortunate
events
that
could
have
befallen
those
persons
was
that
period
of
adversity
through
which
they
had
been
doomed
to
pass
most
of
the
defects
that
adhered
to
the
character
of
dudley
had
by
this
means
been
exterminated
he
was
now
cured
of
those
prejudices
which
his
early
prosperity
had
instilled
and
which
had
flowed
from
luxurious
indigencies
he
had
learned
to
estimate
himself
at
his
true
value
and
to
sympathize
with
sufferings
which
he
himself
had
partaken
it
was
easy
to
perceive
in
what
light
constantia
was
regarded
by
her
father
he
never
reflected
on
his
relation
to
her
without
rapture
her
qualities
were
the
objects
of
his
adoration
he
resigned
himself
with
pleasure
to
her
guidance
the
chain
of
subordination
and
duties
was
reversed
by
the
ascendancy
of
her
genius
and
wisdom
the
province
of
protection
and
the
tribute
of
homage
had
devolved
upon
her
this
had
resulted
from
incessant
experience
of
the
wisdom
of
her
measures
and
the
spectacle
of
her
fortitude
and
skill
in
every
emergency
it
seemed
as
if
but
one
evil
adhered
to
the
condition
of
this
man
his
blindness
was
an
impediment
to
knowledge
and
enjoyment
of
which
the
utmost
to
be
hoped
was
that
he
should
regard
it
without
pungent
regret
and
that
he
should
sometimes
forget
it
that
his
mind
should
occasionally
stray
into
foreign
paths
and
lose
itself
in
sprightly
conversations
or
benign
reveries
this
evil
however
was
by
no
means
remediless
a
surgeon
of
uncommon
skill
had
lately
arrived
from
europe
he
was
one
of
the
numerous
agents
and
dependants
of
ormond
and
had
been
engaged
to
abdicate
his
native
country
for
purposes
widely
remote
from
his
profession
the
first
use
that
was
made
of
him
was
to
introduce
him
to
dudley
the
diseased
organs
were
critically
examined
and
the
patient
was
with
considerable
difficulty
prevailed
upon
to
undergo
the
necessary
operation
his
success
corresponded
with
constantia
wishes
and
her
father
was
once
more
restored
to
the
enjoyment
of
light
these
were
auspicious
events
constantia
held
herself
amply
repaid
by
them
for
all
that
she
had
suffered
these
sufferings
had
indeed
been
light
when
compared
with
the
effects
usually
experienced
by
others
in
a
similar
condition
her
wisdom
had
extracted
its
sting
from
adversity
and
without
allowing
herself
to
feel
much
of
the
evils
of
its
reign
had
employed
it
as
an
instrument
by
which
the
sum
of
her
present
happiness
was
increased
few
suffered
less
in
the
midst
of
poverty
than
she
no
one
ever
extracted
more
felicity
from
the
prosperous
reverse
chapter
viii
when
time
had
somewhat
mitigated
the
memory
of
the
late
disaster
the
intercourse
between
ormond
and
constantia
was
renewed
the
lady
did
not
overlook
her
obligations
to
her
friend
it
was
to
him
that
she
was
indebted
for
her
father
restoration
to
sight
and
to
whom
both
owed
essentially
though
indirectly
their
present
affluence
in
her
mind
gratitude
was
no
perverse
or
ignoble
principle
she
viewed
this
man
as
the
author
of
extensive
benefits
of
which
her
situation
enabled
her
to
judge
with
more
accuracy
than
others
it
created
no
bias
on
her
judgement
or
at
least
none
of
which
she
was
sensible
her
equity
was
perfectly
unfettered
and
she
decided
in
a
way
contrary
to
his
inclination
with
as
little
scruple
as
if
the
benefits
had
been
received
not
by
herself
but
by
him
she
indeed
intended
his
benefit
though
she
thwarted
his
inclinations
she
had
few
visitants
beside
himself
their
interviews
were
daily
and
unformal
the
fate
of
helena
never
produced
any
reproaches
on
her
part
she
saw
the
uselessness
of
recrimination
not
only
because
she
desired
to
produce
emotions
different
from
those
which
infective
is
adapted
to
excite
but
because
it
was
more
just
to
soothe
than
to
exasperate
the
inquietudes
which
haunted
him
she
now
enjoyed
leisure
she
had
always
been
solicitous
for
mental
improvement
any
means
subservient
to
this
end
were
valuable
the
conversation
of
ormond
was
an
inexhaustible
fund
by
the
variety
of
topics
and
the
excitement
to
reflection
it
supplied
a
more
plenteous
influx
of
knowledge
was
produced
than
could
have
flowed
from
any
other
source
there
was
no
end
to
the
detailing
of
facts
and
the
canvassing
of
theories
i
have
already
said
that
ormond
was
engaged
in
schemes
of
an
arduous
and
elevated
nature
these
were
the
topics
of
epistolary
discussion
between
him
and
a
certain
number
of
coadjutors
in
different
parts
of
the
world
in
general
discourse
it
was
proper
to
maintain
a
uniform
silence
respecting
these
not
only
because
they
involved
principles
and
views
remote
from
vulgar
apprehension
but
because
their
success
in
some
measure
depended
on
their
secrecy
he
could
not
give
a
stronger
proof
of
his
confidence
in
the
sagacity
and
steadiness
of
constantia
than
he
now
gave
by
imparting
to
her
his
schemes
and
requesting
her
advice
and
assistance
in
the
progress
of
them
his
disclosures
however
were
imperfect
what
knowledge
was
imparted
instead
of
appeasing
only
tended
to
inflame
her
curiosity
his
answers
to
her
inquiries
were
prompt
and
at
first
sight
sufficiently
explicit
but
upon
reconsideration
an
obscurity
seemed
to
gather
round
them
to
be
dispelled
by
new
interrogatories
these
in
like
manner
effected
a
momentary
purpose
but
were
sure
speedily
to
lead
into
new
conjectures
and
reimmerse
her
in
doubts
the
task
was
always
new
was
always
on
the
point
of
being
finished
and
always
to
be
recommenced
ormond
aspired
to
nothing
more
ardently
than
to
hold
the
reins
of
opinion
to
exercise
absolute
power
over
the
conduct
of
others
not
by
constraining
their
limbs
or
by
exacting
obedience
to
his
authority
but
in
a
way
of
which
his
subjects
should
be
scarcely
conscious
he
desired
that
his
guidance
should
control
their
steps
but
that
his
agency
when
most
effectual
should
be
least
suspected
if
he
were
solicitous
to
govern
the
thoughts
of
constantia
or
to
regulate
her
condition
the
mode
which
he
pursued
had
hitherto
been
admirably
conducive
to
that
end
to
have
found
her
friendless
and
indigent
accorded
with
the
most
fortunate
exactness
with
his
views
that
she
should
have
descended
to
this
depth
from
a
prosperous
height
and
therefore
be
a
stranger
to
the
torpor
which
attends
hereditary
poverty
and
be
qualified
rightly
to
estimate
and
use
the
competence
to
which
by
this
means
she
was
now
restored
was
all
that
his
providence
would
have
prescribed
her
thoughts
were
equally
obsequious
to
his
direction
the
novelty
and
grandeur
of
his
schemes
could
not
fail
to
transport
a
mind
ardent
and
capacious
as
that
of
constantia
here
his
fortune
had
been
no
less
propitious
he
did
not
fail
to
discover
and
was
not
slow
to
seize
the
advantages
flowing
thence
by
explaining
his
plans
opportunity
was
furnished
to
lead
and
to
confine
her
meditations
to
the
desirable
tract
by
adding
fictitious
embellishments
he
adapted
it
with
more
exactness
to
his
purpose
by
piecemeal
and
imperfect
disclosures
her
curiosity
was
kept
alive
i
have
described
ormond
at
having
contracted
a
passion
for
constantia
this
passion
certainly
existed
in
his
heart
but
it
must
not
be
conceived
to
be
immutable
or
to
operate
independently
of
all
those
impulses
and
habits
which
time
had
interwoven
in
his
character
the
person
and
affections
of
this
woman
were
the
objects
sought
by
him
and
which
it
was
the
dearest
purpose
of
his
existence
to
gain
this
was
his
supreme
good
though
the
motives
to
which
it
was
indebted
for
its
in
his
imagination
were
numerous
and
complex
i
have
enumerated
his
opinions
on
the
subject
of
wedlock
the
question
will
obviously
occur
whether
constantia
was
sought
by
him
with
upright
or
flagitious
views
his
sentiments
and
resolution
on
this
head
had
for
a
time
fluctuated
but
were
now
steadfast
marriage
was
in
his
eyes
hateful
and
absurd
as
ever
constantia
was
to
be
obtained
by
any
means
if
other
terms
were
rejected
he
was
willing
for
the
sake
of
this
good
to
accept
her
as
a
wife
but
this
was
a
choice
to
be
made
only
when
every
expedient
was
exhausted
for
reconciling
her
to
a
compact
of
a
different
kind
for
this
end
he
prescribed
to
himself
a
path
suited
to
the
character
of
this
lady
he
made
no
secret
of
his
sentiments
and
views
he
avowed
his
love
and
described
without
scruple
the
scope
of
his
wishes
he
challenged
her
to
confute
his
principles
and
promised
a
candid
audience
and
profound
consideration
to
her
arguments
her
present
opinions
he
knew
to
be
adverse
to
his
own
but
he
hoped
to
change
them
by
subtlety
and
perseverance
his
further
hopes
and
designs
he
concealed
from
her
she
was
unaware
that
if
he
were
unable
to
effect
a
change
in
her
creed
he
was
determined
to
adopt
a
system
of
imposture
to
assume
the
guise
of
a
convert
to
her
doctrines
and
appear
as
devout
as
herself
in
his
notions
of
the
sanctity
of
marriage
perhaps
it
was
not
difficult
to
have
foreseen
the
consequence
of
these
projects
constantia
peril
was
imminent
this
arose
not
only
from
the
talents
and
address
of
ormond
but
from
the
community
of
sentiment
which
already
existed
between
them
she
was
unguarded
in
a
point
where
if
not
her
whole
yet
doubtless
her
principal
security
and
strongest
bulwark
would
have
existed
she
was
unacquainted
with
religion
she
was
unhabituated
to
conform
herself
to
any
standard
but
that
connected
with
the
present
life
matrimonial
as
well
as
every
other
human
duty
was
disconnected
in
her
mind
with
any
awful
or
divine
sanction
she
formed
her
estimate
of
good
and
evil
on
nothing
but
terrestrial
and
visible
consequences
this
defect
in
her
character
she
owed
to
her
father
system
of
education
dudley
was
an
adherent
to
what
he
conceived
to
be
true
religion
no
man
was
more
passionate
in
his
eulogy
of
his
own
form
of
devotion
and
belief
or
in
his
invectives
against
atheistical
dogmas
but
he
reflected
that
religion
assumed
many
forms
one
only
of
which
is
salutary
or
true
and
that
truth
in
this
respect
is
incompatible
with
infantile
and
premature
instruction
to
this
subject
it
was
requisite
to
apply
the
force
of
a
mature
and
unfettered
understanding
for
this
end
he
laboured
to
lead
away
the
juvenile
reflections
of
constantia
from
religious
topics
to
detain
them
in
the
paths
of
history
and
eloquence
to
accustom
her
to
the
accuracy
of
geometrical
deduction
and
to
the
view
of
those
evils
that
have
flowed
in
all
ages
from
mistaken
piety
in
consequence
of
this
scheme
her
habits
rather
than
her
opinions
were
undevout
religion
was
regarded
by
her
not
with
disbelief
but
with
absolute
indifference
her
good
sense
forbade
her
to
decide
before
inquiry
but
her
modes
of
study
and
reflection
were
foreign
to
and
unfitted
her
for
this
species
of
discussion
her
mind
was
seldom
called
to
meditate
on
this
subject
and
when
it
occurred
her
perceptions
were
vague
and
obscure
no
objects
in
the
sphere
which
she
occupied
were
calculated
to
suggest
to
her
the
importance
of
investigation
and
certainty
it
becomes
me
to
confess
however
reluctantly
thus
much
concerning
my
friend
however
abundantly
endowed
in
other
respects
she
was
a
stranger
to
the
felicity
and
excellence
flowing
from
religion
in
her
struggles
with
misfortune
she
was
supported
and
cheered
by
the
sense
of
no
approbation
but
her
own
a
defect
of
this
nature
will
perhaps
be
regarded
as
of
less
moment
when
her
extreme
youth
is
remembered
all
opinion
in
her
mind
were
mutable
inasmuch
as
the
progress
of
her
understanding
was
incessant
it
was
otherwise
with
ormond
his
disbelief
was
at
once
unchangeable
and
strenuous
the
universe
was
to
him
a
series
of
events
connected
by
an
undesigning
and
inscrutable
necessity
and
an
assemblage
of
forms
to
which
no
beginning
or
end
can
be
conceived
instead
of
transient
views
and
vague
ideas
his
meditations
on
religious
points
had
been
intense
enthusiasm
was
added
to
disbelief
and
he
not
only
dissented
but
abhorred
he
deemed
it
prudent
however
to
disguise
sentiments
which
if
unfolded
in
their
full
force
would
wear
to
her
the
appearance
of
insanity
but
he
saw
and
was
eager
to
improve
the
advantage
which
his
creed
derived
from
the
unsettled
state
of
her
opinions
he
was
not
unaware
likewise
of
the
auspicious
and
indispensable
of
love
if
this
advocate
were
wanting
in
her
bosom
all
his
efforts
would
be
in
vain
if
this
pleader
were
engaged
in
his
behalf
he
entertained
no
doubts
of
his
ultimate
success
he
conceived
that
her
present
situation
all
whose
comforts
were
the
fruits
of
his
beneficence
and
which
afforded
her
no
other
subject
of
contemplation
than
himself
was
as
favourable
as
possible
to
the
growth
of
this
passion
constantia
was
acquainted
with
his
wishes
she
could
not
fail
to
see
that
she
might
speedily
be
called
upon
to
determine
a
momentous
question
her
own
sensations
and
the
character
of
ormond
were
therefore
scrutinized
with
suspicious
attention
marriage
could
be
justified
in
her
eyes
only
by
community
of
affections
and
opinions
she
might
love
without
the
sanction
of
her
judgement
but
while
destitute
of
that
sanction
she
would
never
suffer
it
to
sway
her
conduct
ormond
was
imperfectly
known
what
knowledge
she
had
gained
flowed
chiefly
from
his
own
lips
and
was
therefore
unattended
with
certainty
what
portion
of
deceit
or
disguise
was
mixed
with
his
conversation
could
be
known
only
by
witnessing
his
actions
with
her
own
eyes
and
comparing
his
testimony
with
that
of
others
he
had
embraced
a
multitude
of
opinions
which
appeared
to
her
erroneous
till
these
were
rectified
and
their
conclusions
were
made
to
correspond
wedlock
was
improper
some
of
these
obscurities
might
be
dispelled
and
some
of
these
discords
be
resolved
into
harmony
by
time
meanwhile
it
was
proper
to
guard
the
avenues
to
her
heart
and
screen
herself
from
there
was
no
motive
to
conceal
her
reflections
on
this
topic
from
her
father
dudley
discovered
without
her
assistance
the
views
of
ormond
his
daughter
happiness
was
blended
with
his
own
he
lived
but
in
the
consciousness
of
her
tranquillity
her
image
was
seldom
absent
from
his
eyes
and
never
from
his
thoughts
the
emotions
which
it
excited
sprung
but
in
part
from
the
relationship
of
father
it
was
gratitude
and
veneration
which
she
claimed
from
him
and
which
filled
him
with
rapture
he
ruminated
deeply
on
the
character
of
ormond
the
political
and
tenets
of
this
man
were
regarded
not
merely
with
disapprobation
but
antipathy
he
was
not
ungrateful
for
the
benefits
which
had
been
conferred
upon
him
ormond
peculiarities
of
sentiment
excited
no
impatience
as
long
as
he
was
regarded
merely
as
a
visitant
it
was
only
as
one
claiming
to
possess
his
daughter
that
his
presence
excited
in
dudley
trepidation
and
loathing
ormond
was
unacquainted
with
what
was
passing
in
the
mind
of
dudley
the
latter
conceived
his
own
benefactor
and
his
daughter
friend
to
be
entitled
to
the
most
scrupulous
and
affable
urbanity
his
objections
to
a
nearer
alliance
were
urged
with
frequent
and
pathetic
vehemence
only
in
his
private
interviews
with
constantia
ormond
and
he
seldom
met
dudley
as
soon
as
his
sight
was
perfectly
retrieved
betook
himself
with
eagerness
to
painting
an
amusement
which
his
late
privations
had
only
contributed
to
endear
to
him
things
remained
nearly
on
their
present
footing
for
some
months
at
the
end
of
this
period
some
engagement
obliged
ormond
to
leave
the
city
he
promised
to
return
with
as
much
speed
as
circumstances
would
admit
meanwhile
his
letters
supplied
her
with
topics
of
reflection
these
were
frequently
received
and
were
models
of
that
energy
of
style
which
results
from
simplicity
of
structure
from
picturesque
epithets
and
from
the
compression
of
much
meaning
into
few
words
his
arguments
seldom
imparted
conviction
but
delight
never
failed
to
flow
from
their
lucid
order
and
cogent
brevity
his
narratives
were
unequalled
for
rapidity
and
comprehensiveness
every
sentence
was
a
treasury
to
moralists
and
painters
chapter
ix
domestic
and
studious
occupations
did
not
wholly
engross
the
attention
of
constantia
social
pleasures
were
precious
to
her
heart
and
she
was
not
backward
to
form
fellowships
and
friendships
with
those
around
her
hitherto
she
had
met
with
no
one
entitled
to
an
uncommon
portion
of
regard
or
worthy
to
supply
the
place
of
the
friend
of
her
infancy
her
visits
were
rare
and
as
yet
chiefly
confined
to
the
family
of
melbourne
here
she
was
treated
with
flattering
distinctions
and
enjoyed
opportunities
of
extending
as
far
as
she
pleased
her
connections
with
the
gay
and
opulent
to
this
she
felt
herself
by
no
means
inclined
and
her
life
was
still
eminently
distinguished
by
love
of
privacy
and
habits
of
seclusion
one
morning
feeling
an
indisposition
to
abstraction
she
determined
to
drop
in
for
an
hour
on
melbourne
finding
parlour
unoccupied
she
proceeded
unceremoniously
to
an
apartment
on
the
second
floor
where
that
lady
was
accustomed
to
sit
she
entered
but
this
room
was
likewise
empty
here
she
cast
her
eyes
on
a
collection
of
prints
copied
from
the
farnese
collection
and
employed
herself
for
some
minutes
in
comparing
the
forms
of
titiano
and
the
caracchi
suddenly
notes
of
peculiar
sweetness
were
wafted
to
her
ear
from
without
she
listened
with
surprise
for
the
tones
of
her
father
lute
were
distinctly
recognized
she
hied
to
the
window
which
chanced
to
look
into
a
back
court
the
music
was
perceived
to
come
from
the
window
of
the
next
house
she
recollected
her
interview
with
the
purchaser
of
her
instrument
at
the
music
shop
and
the
powerful
impression
which
the
stranger
countenance
had
made
upon
her
the
first
use
she
had
made
of
her
recent
change
of
fortune
was
to
endeavour
to
recover
this
instrument
the
music
dealer
when
reminded
of
the
purchase
and
interrogated
as
to
the
practicability
of
regaining
the
lute
for
which
she
was
willing
to
give
treble
the
price
answered
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
foreign
lady
beyond
what
was
gained
at
the
interview
which
took
place
in
constantia
presence
of
her
name
residence
and
condition
he
knew
nothing
and
had
endeavoured
in
vain
to
acquire
knowledge
now
this
incident
seemed
to
have
furnished
her
with
the
information
she
had
so
earnestly
sought
this
performer
was
probably
the
stranger
herself
her
residence
so
near
the
melbournes
and
in
a
house
which
was
the
property
of
the
magistrate
might
be
means
of
information
as
to
her
condition
and
perhaps
of
introduction
to
a
personal
acquaintance
while
engaged
in
these
reflections
melbourne
entered
the
apartment
constantia
related
this
incident
to
her
friend
and
stated
the
motives
of
her
present
curiosity
her
friend
willingly
imparted
what
knowledge
she
possessed
relative
to
this
subject
this
was
the
sum
this
house
had
been
hired
previously
to
the
appearance
of
the
yellow
fever
by
an
english
family
who
left
their
native
soil
with
a
view
to
a
permanent
abode
in
the
new
world
they
had
scarcely
taken
possession
of
the
dwelling
when
they
were
terrified
by
the
progress
of
the
epidemic
they
had
fled
from
the
danger
but
this
circumstance
in
addition
to
some
others
induced
them
to
change
their
scheme
an
evil
so
unwonted
as
pestilence
impressed
them
with
a
belief
of
perpetual
danger
as
long
as
they
remained
on
this
side
of
the
ocean
they
prepared
for
an
immediate
return
to
england
for
this
end
their
house
was
relinquished
and
their
splendid
furniture
destined
to
be
sold
by
auction
before
this
event
could
take
place
application
was
made
to
melbourne
by
a
lady
whom
his
description
showed
to
be
the
same
person
of
whom
constantia
was
in
search
she
not
only
rented
the
house
but
negotiated
by
means
of
her
landlord
for
the
purchase
of
the
furniture
her
servants
were
blacks
and
all
but
one
who
officiated
as
steward
unacquainted
with
the
english
language
some
accident
had
proved
her
name
to
be
beauvais
she
had
no
visitants
very
rarely
walked
abroad
and
then
only
in
the
evening
with
a
female
servant
in
attendance
her
hours
appeared
to
be
divided
between
the
lute
and
the
pen
as
to
her
previous
history
or
her
present
sources
of
subsistence
melbourne
curiosity
had
not
been
idle
but
no
consistent
information
was
obtainable
some
incidents
had
given
birth
to
the
conjecture
that
she
was
wife
or
daughter
or
sister
of
beauvais
the
partizan
of
brissot
whom
the
faction
of
marat
had
lately
consigned
to
the
scaffold
but
this
conjecture
was
unsupported
by
suitable
evidence
this
tale
by
no
means
diminished
constantia
desire
of
personal
intercourse
she
saw
no
means
of
effecting
her
purpose
melbourne
was
unqualified
to
introduce
her
having
been
discouraged
in
all
the
advances
she
had
made
towards
a
more
friendly
intercourse
constantia
reflected
that
her
motives
to
seclusion
would
probably
induce
this
lady
to
treat
others
as
her
friend
had
been
treated
it
was
possible
however
to
gain
access
to
her
if
not
as
a
friend
yet
as
the
original
proprietor
of
the
lute
she
determined
to
employ
the
agency
of
roseveldt
the
for
the
purpose
of
rebuying
this
instrument
to
enforce
her
application
she
commissioned
this
person
whose
obliging
temper
entitled
him
to
confidence
to
state
her
inducements
for
originally
offering
it
for
sale
and
her
motives
for
desiring
the
repossession
on
any
terms
which
the
lady
thought
proper
to
dictate
roseveldt
fixed
an
hour
in
which
it
was
convenient
for
him
to
execute
her
commission
this
hour
having
passed
constantia
who
was
anxious
respecting
his
success
hastened
to
his
house
roseveldt
delivered
the
instrument
which
the
lady
having
listened
to
his
pleas
and
offers
directed
to
be
gratuitously
restored
to
constantia
at
first
she
had
expressed
her
resolution
to
part
with
it
on
no
account
and
at
no
price
its
music
was
her
only
recreation
and
this
instrument
surpassed
any
she
had
ever
before
seen
in
the
costliness
and
delicacy
of
its
workmanship
but
roseveldt
representations
produced
an
instant
change
of
resolution
and
she
not
only
eagerly
consented
to
restore
it
but
refused
to
receive
any
thing
in
payment
constantia
was
deeply
affected
by
this
unexpected
generosity
it
was
not
her
custom
to
be
outstripped
in
this
career
she
now
condemned
herself
for
her
eagerness
to
regain
this
instrument
during
her
blindness
it
was
a
powerful
because
the
only
solace
of
his
melancholy
now
he
had
no
longer
the
same
anxieties
to
encounter
and
books
and
the
pencil
were
means
of
gratification
always
at
hand
the
lute
therefore
she
imagined
could
be
easily
dispensed
with
by
dudley
whereas
its
power
of
consoling
might
be
as
useful
to
the
unknown
lady
as
it
had
formerly
been
to
her
father
she
readily
perceived
in
what
manner
it
became
her
to
act
roseveldt
was
commissioned
to
redeliver
the
lute
and
to
entreat
the
lady
acceptance
of
it
the
tender
was
received
without
hesitation
and
roseveldt
dismissed
without
any
inquiry
relative
to
constantia
these
transactions
were
reflected
on
by
constantia
with
considerable
earnestness
the
conduct
of
the
stranger
her
affluent
and
lonely
slate
her
conjectural
relationship
to
the
actors
in
the
great
theatre
of
europe
were
mingled
together
in
the
fancy
of
constantia
and
embellished
with
the
conceptions
of
her
beauty
derived
from
their
casual
meeting
at
roseveldt
she
forgot
not
their
similitude
in
age
and
sex
and
delighted
to
prolong
the
dream
of
future
confidence
and
friendship
to
take
place
between
them
her
heart
sighed
for
a
companion
fitted
to
partake
in
all
her
sympathies
this
strain
by
being
connected
with
the
image
of
a
being
like
herself
who
had
grown
up
with
her
from
childhood
who
had
been
entwined
with
her
earliest
affections
but
from
whom
she
had
been
severed
from
the
period
at
which
her
father
misfortunes
commenced
and
of
whose
present
condition
she
was
wholly
ignorant
was
productive
of
the
deepest
melancholy
it
filled
her
with
excruciating
and
for
a
time
irremediable
sadness
it
formed
a
kind
of
paroxysm
which
like
some
febrile
affections
approach
and
retire
without
warning
and
against
the
most
vehement
struggles
in
this
mood
her
fancy
was
thronged
with
recollections
of
scenes
in
which
her
friend
had
sustained
a
part
their
last
interview
was
commonly
revived
in
her
remembrance
so
forcibly
as
almost
to
produce
a
lunatic
conception
of
its
reality
a
ditty
which
they
sung
together
on
that
occasion
flowed
to
her
lips
if
ever
human
tones
were
qualified
to
convey
the
whole
soul
they
were
those
of
constantia
when
she
sang
the
breeze
awakes
the
bark
prepares
to
waft
me
to
a
distant
shore
but
far
beyond
this
world
of
cares
we
meet
again
to
part
no
more
these
fits
were
accustomed
to
approach
and
to
vanish
by
degrees
they
were
transitory
but
not
unfrequent
and
were
pregnant
with
such
agonizing
tenderness
such
sighs
and
a
flow
of
such
bitter
yet
delicious
tears
that
it
were
not
easily
decided
whether
the
pleasure
or
the
pain
surmounted
when
symptoms
of
their
coming
were
felt
she
hastened
into
solitude
that
the
progress
of
her
feelings
might
endure
no
restraint
on
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
the
lute
had
been
sent
to
the
foreign
lady
constantia
was
alone
in
her
chamber
immersed
in
desponding
thoughts
from
these
she
was
recalled
by
fabian
her
black
servant
who
announced
a
guest
she
was
loath
to
break
off
the
thread
of
her
present
meditations
and
inquired
with
a
tone
of
some
impatience
who
was
the
guest
the
servant
was
unable
to
tell
it
was
a
young
lady
whom
he
had
never
before
seen
she
had
opened
the
door
herself
and
entered
the
parlour
without
previous
notice
constantia
paused
at
this
relation
her
thoughts
had
recently
been
fixed
upon
sophia
westwyn
since
their
parting
four
years
before
she
had
heard
no
tidings
of
this
woman
her
fears
imagined
no
more
probable
cause
of
her
friend
silence
than
her
death
this
however
was
uncertain
the
question
now
occurred
and
brought
with
it
sensations
that
left
her
no
power
to
move
was
this
the
guest
her
doubts
were
quickly
dispelled
for
the
stranger
taking
a
light
from
the
table
and
not
brooking
the
servant
delays
followed
fabian
to
the
chamber
of
his
mistress
she
entered
with
careless
freedom
and
presented
to
the
astonished
eyes
of
constantia
the
figure
she
had
met
at
roseveldt
and
the
purchaser
of
her
lute
the
stranger
advanced
towards
her
with
quick
steps
and
mingling
tones
of
benignity
and
sprightliness
said
i
have
come
to
perform
a
duty
i
have
received
from
you
a
lute
that
i
valued
almost
as
my
best
friend
to
find
another
in
america
would
not
perhaps
be
possible
but
certainly
none
equally
superb
and
exquisite
as
this
can
be
found
to
show
how
highly
i
esteem
the
gift
i
have
come
in
person
to
thank
you
for
it
there
she
stopped
constantia
could
not
suddenly
recover
from
the
extreme
surprise
into
which
the
unexpectedness
of
this
meeting
had
thrown
her
she
could
scarcely
sufficiently
suppress
this
confusion
to
enable
her
to
reply
to
these
rapid
effusions
of
her
visitant
who
resumed
with
augmented
freedom
i
came
as
i
said
to
thank
you
but
to
say
the
truth
that
was
not
all
i
came
likewise
to
see
you
having
done
my
errand
i
suppose
i
must
go
i
would
fain
stay
longer
and
talk
to
you
a
little
will
you
give
me
leave
constantia
scarcely
retrieving
her
composure
stammered
out
a
polite
assent
they
seated
themselves
and
the
visitant
pressing
the
hand
she
had
taken
proceeded
in
a
strain
so
smooth
so
flowing
sliding
from
grave
to
gay
blending
vivacity
with
tenderness
interpreting
constantia
silence
with
such
keen
sagacity
and
accounting
for
the
singularities
of
her
own
deportment
in
a
way
so
respectful
to
her
companion
and
so
worthy
of
a
steadfast
and
pure
mind
in
herself
that
every
embarrassment
and
scruple
were
quickly
banished
from
their
interview
in
an
hour
the
guest
took
her
leave
no
promise
of
repeating
her
visit
and
no
request
that
constantia
would
repay
it
was
made
their
parting
seemed
to
be
the
last
whatever
purpose
having
been
contemplated
appeared
to
be
accomplished
by
this
transient
meeting
it
was
of
a
nature
deeply
to
interest
the
mind
of
constantia
this
was
the
lady
who
talked
with
roseveldt
and
bargained
with
melbourne
and
they
had
been
induced
by
appearances
to
suppose
her
ignorant
of
any
language
but
french
but
her
discourse
on
the
present
occasion
was
in
english
and
was
distinguished
by
unrivalled
fluency
her
phrases
and
habits
of
pronouncing
were
untinctured
by
any
foreign
mixture
and
bespoke
the
perfect
knowledge
of
a
native
of
america
on
the
next
evening
while
constantia
was
reviewing
this
transaction
calling
up
and
weighing
the
sentiments
which
the
stranger
had
uttered
and
indulging
some
regret
at
the
unlikelihood
of
their
again
meeting
martinette
for
i
will
henceforth
call
her
by
her
true
name
entered
the
apartment
as
abruptly
as
before
she
accounted
for
the
visit
merely
by
the
pleasure
it
afforded
her
and
proceeded
in
a
strain
even
more
versatile
and
brilliant
than
before
this
interview
ended
like
the
first
without
any
tokens
on
the
part
of
the
guest
of
resolution
or
desire
to
renew
it
but
a
third
interview
took
place
on
the
ensuing
day
henceforth
martinette
became
a
frequent
but
hasty
visitant
and
constantia
became
daily
more
enamoured
of
her
new
acquaintance
she
did
not
overlook
peculiarities
in
the
conversation
and
deportment
of
this
woman
these
exhibited
no
tendencies
to
confidence
or
traces
of
sympathy
they
merely
denoted
large
experience
vigorous
faculties
and
masculine
attainments
herself
was
never
introduced
except
as
an
observer
but
her
observations
on
government
and
manners
were
profound
and
critical
her
education
seemed
not
widely
different
from
that
which
constantia
had
received
it
was
classical
and
mathematical
but
to
this
was
added
a
knowledge
of
political
and
military
transactions
in
europe
during
the
present
age
which
implied
the
possession
of
better
means
of
information
than
books
she
depicted
scenes
and
characters
with
the
accuracy
of
one
who
had
partaken
and
witnessed
them
herself
constantia
attention
had
been
chiefly
occupied
by
personal
concerns
her
youth
had
passed
in
contention
with
misfortune
or
in
the
quietudes
of
study
she
could
not
be
unapprised
of
contemporary
revolutions
and
wars
but
her
ideas
concerning
them
were
indefinite
and
vague
her
views
and
her
inferences
on
this
head
were
general
and
speculative
her
acquaintance
with
history
was
exact
and
circumstantial
in
proportion
as
she
retired
backward
from
her
own
age
she
knew
more
of
the
siege
of
mutina
than
that
of
lisle
more
of
the
machinations
of
cataline
and
the
tumults
of
clodius
than
of
the
prostration
of
the
bastile
and
the
proscriptions
of
marat
she
listened
therefore
with
unspeakable
eagerness
to
this
reciter
who
detailed
to
her
as
the
occasion
suggested
the
progress
of
action
and
opinion
on
the
theatre
of
france
and
poland
conceived
and
rehearsed
as
this
was
with
the
energy
and
copiousness
of
one
who
sustained
a
part
in
the
scene
the
mind
of
constantia
was
always
kept
at
the
pitch
of
curiosity
and
wonder
but
while
this
historian
described
the
features
personal
deportment
and
domestic
character
of
antoinette
mirabeau
and
robespierre
an
impenetrable
veil
was
drawn
over
her
own
condition
there
was
a
warmth
and
freedom
in
her
details
which
bespoke
her
own
in
these
events
but
was
unattended
by
transports
of
indignation
or
sorrow
or
by
pauses
of
abstraction
such
as
were
likely
to
occur
in
one
whose
hopes
and
fears
had
been
intimately
blended
with
public
events
constantia
could
not
but
derive
humiliation
from
comparing
her
own
slender
acquirements
with
those
of
her
companion
she
was
sensible
that
all
the
differences
between
them
arose
from
diversities
of
situation
she
was
eager
to
discover
in
what
particulars
this
diversity
consisted
she
was
for
a
time
withheld
by
scruples
not
easily
explained
from
disclosing
her
wishes
an
accident
however
occurred
to
remove
these
impediments
one
evening
this
unceremonious
visitant
discovered
constantia
busily
surveying
a
chart
of
the
mediterranean
sea
this
circumstance
led
the
discourse
to
the
present
state
of
syria
and
cyprus
martinette
was
copious
in
her
details
constantia
listened
for
a
time
and
when
a
pause
ensued
questioned
her
companion
as
to
the
means
she
possessed
of
acquiring
so
much
knowledge
this
question
was
proposed
with
diffidence
and
prefaced
by
apologies
instead
of
being
offended
by
your
question
replied
the
guest
i
only
wonder
that
it
never
before
occurred
to
you
travellers
tell
us
much
volney
and
mariti
would
have
told
you
nearly
all
that
i
have
told
with
these
i
have
conversed
personally
as
well
as
read
their
books
but
my
knowledge
is
in
truth
a
species
of
patrimony
i
inherit
it
will
you
be
good
enough
said
constantia
to
explain
yourself
my
mother
was
a
greek
of
cyprus
my
father
was
a
slavonian
of
ragusa
and
i
was
born
in
a
garden
at
aleppo
that
was
a
singular
concurrence
how
singular
that
a
nautical
vagrant
like
my
father
should
sometimes
anchor
in
the
bay
of
naples
that
a
cyprian
merchant
should
carry
his
property
and
daughter
beyond
the
reach
of
a
turkish
sangjack
and
seek
an
asylum
so
commodious
as
napoli
that
my
father
should
have
dealings
with
this
merchant
see
love
and
marry
his
daughter
and
afterwards
procure
from
the
french
government
a
consular
commission
to
aleppo
that
the
union
should
in
due
time
be
productive
of
a
son
and
daughter
are
events
far
from
being
singular
they
happen
daily
and
may
i
venture
to
ask
if
this
be
your
history
the
history
of
my
parents
i
hope
you
do
not
consider
the
place
of
my
birth
as
the
sole
or
the
most
important
circumstance
of
my
life
nothing
would
please
me
more
than
to
be
enabled
to
compare
it
with
other
incidents
i
am
apt
to
think
that
your
life
is
a
tissue
of
surprising
events
that
the
daughter
of
a
ragusan
and
greek
should
have
seen
and
known
so
much
that
she
should
talk
english
with
equal
fluency
and
more
correctness
than
a
native
that
i
should
now
be
conversing
with
her
in
a
corner
so
remote
from
cyprus
and
sicily
are
events
more
wonderful
than
any
which
i
have
known
wonderful
pish
thy
ignorance
thy
miscalculation
of
probabilities
is
far
more
so
my
father
talked
to
me
in
slavonic
my
mother
and
her
maids
talked
to
me
in
greek
my
neighbours
talked
to
me
in
a
medley
of
arabic
syriac
and
turkish
my
father
secretary
was
a
scholar
he
was
as
well
versed
in
lysias
and
xenophon
as
any
of
their
contemporaries
he
laboured
for
ten
years
to
enable
me
to
read
a
language
essentially
the
same
with
that
i
used
daily
to
my
nurse
and
mother
is
it
wonderful
then
that
i
should
be
skilful
in
slavonic
greek
and
the
jargon
of
aleppo
to
have
refrained
from
learning
was
impossible
suppose
a
girl
prompt
diligent
inquisitive
to
spend
ten
years
of
her
life
partly
in
spain
partly
in
tuscany
partly
in
france
and
partly
in
england
with
her
versatile
curiosity
and
flexible
organs
would
it
be
possible
for
her
to
remain
ignorant
of
each
of
these
languages
latin
is
the
mother
of
them
all
and
presents
itself
of
course
to
her
studious
attention
i
can
not
easily
conceive
motives
which
should
lead
you
before
the
age
of
twenty
through
so
many
scenes
can
you
not
you
grew
and
flourished
like
a
frail
mimosa
in
the
spot
where
destiny
had
planted
you
thank
my
stars
i
am
somewhat
better
than
a
vegetable
necessity
it
is
true
and
not
choice
set
me
in
motion
but
i
am
not
sorry
for
the
consequences
is
it
too
much
said
constantia
with
some
hesitation
to
request
a
detail
of
your
youthful
adventures
too
much
to
give
perhaps
at
a
short
notice
to
such
as
you
my
tale
might
abound
with
novelty
while
to
others
more
acquainted
with
vicissitudes
it
would
be
tedious
and
flat
i
must
be
gone
in
a
few
minutes
for
that
and
for
better
reasons
i
must
not
be
minute
a
summary
at
present
will
enable
you
to
judge
how
far
a
more
copious
narrative
is
suited
to
instruct
or
to
please
you
end
of
vol
ii
