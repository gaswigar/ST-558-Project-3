preface
the
term
taboo
is
one
of
the
very
few
words
which
the
english
language
has
borrowed
from
the
speech
of
savages
in
the
polynesian
tongue
from
which
we
have
adopted
it
the
word
designates
a
remarkable
system
which
has
deeply
influenced
the
religious
social
and
political
life
of
the
oceanic
islanders
both
polynesians
and
melanesians
particularly
by
inculcating
a
superstitious
veneration
for
the
persons
of
nobles
and
the
rights
of
private
property
when
about
the
year
my
friend
william
robertson
smith
asked
me
to
write
an
article
on
taboo
for
the
ninth
edition
of
the
i
shared
what
i
believe
to
have
been
at
the
time
the
current
view
of
anthropologists
that
the
institution
in
question
was
confined
to
the
brown
and
black
races
of
the
pacific
but
an
attentive
study
of
the
accounts
given
of
taboo
by
observers
who
wrote
while
it
still
flourished
in
polynesia
soon
led
me
to
modify
that
view
the
analogies
which
the
system
presents
to
the
superstitions
not
only
of
savages
elsewhere
but
of
the
civilised
races
of
antiquity
were
too
numerous
and
too
striking
to
be
overlooked
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
taboo
is
only
one
of
a
number
of
similar
systems
of
superstition
which
among
many
perhaps
among
all
races
of
men
have
contributed
in
large
measure
under
many
different
names
and
with
many
variations
of
detail
to
build
up
the
complex
fabric
of
society
in
all
the
various
sides
or
elements
of
it
which
we
describe
as
religious
social
political
moral
and
economic
this
conclusion
i
briefly
indicated
in
my
article
my
general
views
on
the
subject
were
accepted
by
my
friend
robertson
smith
and
applied
by
him
in
his
celebrated
to
the
elucidation
of
some
aspects
of
semitic
religion
since
then
the
importance
of
taboo
and
of
systems
like
it
in
the
evolution
of
religion
and
morality
of
government
and
property
has
been
generally
recognised
and
has
indeed
become
a
commonplace
of
anthropology
the
present
volume
is
merely
an
expansion
of
the
corresponding
chapter
in
the
first
edition
of
golden
it
treats
of
the
principles
of
taboo
in
their
special
application
to
sacred
personages
such
as
kings
and
priests
who
are
the
proper
theme
of
the
book
it
does
not
profess
to
handle
the
subject
as
a
whole
to
pursue
it
into
all
its
ramifications
to
trace
the
manifold
influences
which
systems
of
this
sort
have
exerted
in
moulding
the
multitudinous
forms
of
human
society
a
treatise
which
should
adequately
discuss
these
topics
would
far
exceed
the
limits
which
i
have
prescribed
for
myself
in
golden
for
example
i
have
barely
touched
in
passing
on
the
part
which
these
superstitions
have
played
in
shaping
the
moral
ideas
and
directing
the
moral
practice
of
mankind
a
profound
subject
fraught
perhaps
with
momentous
issues
for
the
time
when
men
shall
seriously
set
themselves
to
revise
their
ethical
code
in
the
light
of
its
origin
for
that
the
ethical
like
the
legal
code
of
a
people
stands
in
need
of
constant
revision
will
hardly
be
disputed
by
any
attentive
and
dispassionate
observer
the
old
view
that
the
principles
of
right
and
wrong
are
immutable
and
eternal
is
no
longer
tenable
the
moral
world
is
as
little
exempt
as
the
physical
world
from
the
law
of
ceaseless
change
of
perpetual
flux
contemplate
the
diversities
the
inconsistencies
the
contradictions
of
the
ethical
ideas
and
the
ethical
practice
not
merely
of
different
peoples
in
different
countries
but
of
the
same
people
in
the
same
country
in
different
ages
then
say
whether
the
foundations
of
morality
are
eternally
fixed
and
unchanging
if
they
seem
so
to
us
as
they
have
probably
seemed
to
men
in
all
ages
who
did
not
extend
their
views
beyond
the
narrow
limits
of
their
time
and
country
it
is
in
all
likelihood
merely
because
the
rate
of
change
is
commonly
so
slow
that
it
is
imperceptible
at
any
moment
and
can
only
be
detected
by
a
comparison
of
accurate
observations
extending
over
long
periods
of
time
such
a
comparison
could
we
make
it
would
probably
convince
us
that
if
we
speak
of
the
moral
law
as
immutable
and
eternal
it
can
only
be
in
the
relative
or
figurative
sense
in
which
we
apply
the
same
words
to
the
outlines
of
the
great
mountains
by
comparison
with
the
generations
of
men
the
mountains
too
are
passing
away
though
we
do
not
see
it
nothing
is
stable
and
abiding
under
or
above
the
sun
we
can
as
little
arrest
the
process
of
moral
evolution
as
we
can
stay
the
sweep
of
the
tides
or
the
courses
of
the
stars
therefore
whether
we
like
it
or
not
the
moral
code
by
which
we
regulate
our
conduct
is
being
constantly
revised
and
altered
old
rules
are
being
silently
expunged
and
new
rules
silently
inscribed
in
the
palimpsest
by
the
busy
the
unresting
hand
of
an
invisible
scribe
for
unlike
the
public
and
formal
revision
of
a
legal
code
the
revision
of
the
moral
code
is
always
private
tacit
and
informal
the
legislators
who
make
and
the
judges
who
administer
it
are
not
clad
in
ermine
and
scarlet
their
edicts
are
not
proclaimed
with
the
blare
of
trumpets
and
the
pomp
of
heraldry
we
ourselves
are
the
lawgivers
and
the
judges
it
is
the
whole
people
who
make
and
alter
the
ethical
standard
and
judge
every
case
by
reference
to
it
we
sit
in
the
highest
court
of
appeal
judging
offenders
daily
and
we
can
not
if
we
would
rid
ourselves
of
the
responsibility
all
that
we
can
do
is
to
take
as
clear
and
comprehensive
a
view
as
possible
of
the
evidence
lest
from
too
narrow
and
partial
a
view
we
should
do
injustice
perhaps
gross
and
irreparable
injustice
to
the
prisoners
at
the
bar
few
things
perhaps
can
better
guard
us
from
narrowness
and
illiberality
in
our
moral
judgments
than
a
survey
of
the
amazing
diversities
of
ethical
theory
and
practice
which
have
been
recorded
among
the
various
races
of
mankind
in
different
ages
and
accordingly
the
comparative
method
applied
to
the
study
of
ethical
phenomena
may
be
expected
to
do
for
morality
what
the
same
method
applied
to
religious
phenomena
is
now
doing
for
religion
by
enlarging
our
mental
horizon
extending
the
boundaries
of
knowledge
throwing
light
on
the
origin
of
current
beliefs
and
practices
and
thereby
directly
assisting
us
to
replace
what
is
effete
by
what
is
vigorous
and
what
is
false
by
what
is
true
the
facts
which
i
have
put
together
in
this
volume
as
well
as
in
some
of
my
other
writings
may
perhaps
serve
as
materials
for
a
future
science
of
comparative
ethics
they
are
rough
stones
which
await
the
rude
sketches
which
more
cunning
hands
than
mine
may
hereafter
work
up

i
the
burden
of
royalty
royal
and
priestly
taboos
at
a
certain
stage
of
early
society
the
king
or
priest
is
often
thought
to
be
endowed
with
supernatural
powers
or
to
be
an
incarnation
of
a
deity
and
consistently
with
this
belief
the
course
of
nature
is
supposed
to
be
more
or
less
under
his
control
and
he
is
held
responsible
for
bad
weather
failure
of
the
crops
and
similar
calamities
to
some
extent
it
appears
to
be
assumed
that
the
king
s
power
over
nature
like
that
over
his
subjects
and
slaves
is
exerted
through
definite
acts
of
will
and
therefore
if
drought
famine
pestilence
or
storms
arise
the
people
attribute
the
misfortune
to
the
negligence
or
guilt
of
their
king
and
punish
him
accordingly
with
stripes
and
bonds
or
if
he
remains
obdurate
with
deposition
and
death
sometimes
however
the
course
of
nature
while
regarded
as
dependent
on
the
king
is
supposed
to
be
partly
independent
of
his
will
his
person
is
considered
if
we
may
express
it
so
as
the
dynamical
centre
of
the
universe
from
which
lines
of
force
radiate
to
all
quarters
of
the
heaven
so
that
any
motion
of
turning
of
his
head
the
lifting
of
his
affects
and
may
seriously
disturb
some
part
of
nature
he
is
the
point
of
support
on
which
hangs
the
balance
of
the
world
and
the
slightest
irregularity
on
his
part
may
overthrow
the
delicate
equipoise
the
greatest
care
must
therefore
be
taken
both
by
and
of
him
and
his
whole
life
down
to
its
minutest
details
must
be
so
regulated
that
no
act
of
his
voluntary
or
involuntary
may
disarrange
or
upset
the
established
order
of
nature
of
this
class
of
monarchs
the
mikado
or
dairi
the
spiritual
emperor
of
japan
is
or
rather
used
to
be
a
typical
example
he
is
an
incarnation
of
the
sun
goddess
the
deity
who
rules
the
universe
gods
and
men
included
once
a
year
all
the
gods
wait
upon
him
and
spend
a
month
at
his
court
during
that
month
the
name
of
which
means
without
gods
no
one
frequents
the
temples
for
they
are
believed
to
be
deserted
the
mikado
receives
from
his
people
and
assumes
in
his
official
proclamations
and
decrees
the
title
of
manifest
or
incarnate
deity
and
he
claims
a
general
authority
over
the
gods
of
japan
for
example
in
an
official
decree
of
the
year
the
emperor
is
described
as
the
incarnate
god
who
governs
the
the
following
description
of
the
mikado
s
mode
of
life
was
written
about
two
hundred
years
ago
even
to
this
day
the
princes
descended
of
this
family
more
particularly
those
who
sit
on
the
throne
are
looked
upon
as
persons
most
holy
in
themselves
and
as
popes
by
birth
and
in
order
to
preserve
these
advantageous
notions
in
the
minds
of
their
subjects
they
are
obliged
to
take
an
uncommon
care
of
their
sacred
persons
and
to
do
such
things
which
examined
according
to
the
customs
of
other
nations
would
be
thought
ridiculous
and
impertinent
it
will
not
be
improper
to
give
a
few
instances
of
it
he
thinks
that
it
would
be
very
prejudicial
to
his
dignity
and
holiness
to
touch
the
ground
with
his
feet
for
this
reason
when
he
intends
to
go
anywhere
he
must
be
carried
thither
on
men
s
shoulders
much
less
will
they
suffer
that
he
should
expose
his
sacred
person
to
the
open
air
and
the
sun
is
not
thought
worthy
to
shine
on
his
head
there
is
such
a
holiness
ascribed
to
all
the
parts
of
his
body
that
he
dares
to
cut
off
neither
his
hair
nor
his
beard
nor
his
nails
however
lest
he
should
grow
too
dirty
they
may
clean
him
in
the
night
when
he
is
asleep
because
they
say
that
which
is
taken
from
his
body
at
that
time
hath
been
stolen
from
him
and
that
such
a
theft
doth
not
prejudice
his
holiness
or
dignity
in
ancient
times
he
was
obliged
to
sit
on
the
throne
for
some
hours
every
morning
with
the
imperial
crown
on
his
head
but
to
sit
altogether
like
a
statue
without
stirring
either
hands
or
feet
head
or
eyes
nor
indeed
any
part
of
his
body
because
by
this
means
it
was
thought
that
he
could
preserve
peace
and
tranquillity
in
his
empire
for
if
unfortunately
he
turned
himself
on
one
side
or
the
other
or
if
he
looked
a
good
while
towards
any
part
of
his
dominions
it
was
apprehended
that
war
famine
fire
or
some
other
great
misfortune
was
near
at
hand
to
desolate
the
country
but
it
having
been
afterwards
discovered
that
the
imperial
crown
was
the
palladium
which
by
its
immobility
could
preserve
peace
in
the
empire
it
was
thought
expedient
to
deliver
his
imperial
person
consecrated
only
to
idleness
and
pleasures
from
this
burthensome
duty
and
therefore
the
crown
is
at
present
placed
on
the
throne
for
some
hours
every
morning
his
victuals
must
be
dressed
every
time
in
new
pots
and
served
at
table
in
new
dishes
both
are
very
clean
and
neat
but
made
only
of
common
clay
that
without
any
considerable
expense
they
may
be
laid
aside
or
broke
after
they
have
served
once
they
are
generally
broke
for
fear
they
should
come
into
the
hands
of
laymen
for
they
believe
religiously
that
if
any
layman
should
presume
to
eat
his
food
out
of
these
sacred
dishes
it
would
swell
and
inflame
his
mouth
and
throat
the
like
ill
effect
is
dreaded
from
the
dairi
s
sacred
habits
for
they
believe
that
if
a
layman
should
wear
them
without
the
emperor
s
express
leave
or
command
they
would
occasion
swellings
and
pains
in
all
parts
of
his
to
the
same
effect
an
earlier
account
of
the
mikado
says
it
was
considered
as
a
shameful
degradation
for
him
even
to
touch
the
ground
with
his
foot
the
sun
and
moon
were
not
even
permitted
to
shine
upon
his
head
none
of
the
superfluities
of
the
body
were
ever
taken
from
him
neither
his
hair
his
beard
nor
his
nails
were
cut
whatever
he
eat
was
dressed

there

called
bagba
who
is
of
great
importance
for
the
whole
of
the
surrounding
country
the
power
of
giving

ascribed
to

he
is

priest
dwells
in

on
the
highest
peak
of
the
mountain
where
he
keeps
the
winds
bottled
up
in
huge
jars
applications
for
rain
too
are
made
to
him
and
he
does
a
good
business
in
amulets
which
consist
of
the
teeth
and
claws
of
leopards
yet
though
his
power
is
great
and
he
is
indeed
the
real
chief
of
the
land
the
rule
of
the
fetish
forbids
him
ever
to
leave

must
spend

whole
of
his
life
on
its
summit
only
once
a

come
down
to
make

in

but
even
then
he
may
not

in

the
same
day
the
business
of
government
in
the
villages
is
conducted
by
subordinate
chiefs
who
are
appointed
by
him
in
the
west
african
kingdom
of
congo
there
was
a
supreme
pontiff
called
chitomé
or
chitombé
whom
the
negroes
regarded
as
a
god
on
earth
and
in
heaven
hence
before
they
would
taste
the
new
crops
they
offered
him
the
fearing
that
manifold
misfortunes
would
befall
them
if
they
broke
this
rule
when
he
left
his
residence
to
visit
other
places
within
his
jurisdiction
all
married
people
had
to
observe
strict
continence
the
whole
time
he
was
out
for
it
was
supposed
that
any
act
of
incontinence
would
prove
fatal
to
him
and
if
he
were
to
die
a
natural
death
they
thought
that
the
world
would
perish
and
the
earth
which
he
alone
sustained
by
his
power
and
merit
would
immediately
be
annihilated
similarly
in
humbe
a
kingdom
of
angola
the
incontinence
of
young
people
under
the
age
of
puberty
used
to
be
a
capital
crime
because
it
was
believed
to
entail
the
death
of
the
king
within
the
year
of
late
the
death
penalty
has
been
commuted
for
a
fine
of
ten
oxen
inflicted
on
each
of
the
culprits
this
commutation
has
attracted
thousands
of
dissolute
youth
to
humbe
from
the
neighbouring
tribes
among
whom
the
old
penalty
is
still
rigorously
exacted
amongst
the
nations
of
the
new
world
at
the
date
of
the
spanish
conquest
there
were
found
hierarchies
or
theocracies
like
those
of
japan
in
particular
the
high
pontiff
of
the
zapotecs
in
southern
mexico
appears
to
have
presented
a
close
parallel
to
the
mikado
a
powerful
rival
to
the
king
himself
this
spiritual
lord
governed
yopaa
one
of
the
chief
cities
of
the
kingdom
with
absolute
dominion
it
is
impossible
we
are
told
to
overrate
the
reverence
in
which
he
was
held
he
was
looked
on
as
a
god
whom
the
earth
was
not
worthy
to
hold
nor
the
sun
to
shine
upon
he
profaned
his
sanctity
if
he
even
touched
the
ground
with
his
foot
the
officers
who
bore
his
palanquin
on
their
shoulders
were
members
of
the
highest
families
he
hardly
deigned
to
look
on
anything
around
him
and
all
who
met
him
fell
with
their
faces
to
the
earth
fearing
that
death
would
overtake
them
if
they
saw
even
his
shadow
a
rule
of
continence
was
regularly
imposed
on
the
zapotec
priests
especially
upon
the
high
pontiff
but
on
certain
days
in
each
year
which
were
generally
celebrated
with
feasts
and
dances
it
was
customary
for
the
high
priest
to
become
drunk
while
in
this
state
seeming
to
belong
neither
to
heaven
nor
to
earth
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
virgins
consecrated
to
the
service
of
the
gods
was
brought
to
if
the
child
she
bore
him
was
a
son
he
was
brought
up
as
a
prince
of
the
blood
and
the
eldest
son
succeeded
his
father
on
the
pontifical
throne
the
supernatural
powers
attributed
to
this
pontiff
are
not
specified
but
probably
they
resembled
those
of
the
mikado
and
chitomé
wherever
as
in
japan
and
west
africa
it
is
supposed
that
the
order
of
nature
and
even
the
existence
of
the
world
is
bound
up
with
the
life
of
the
king
or
priest
it
is
clear
that
he
must
be
regarded
by
his
subjects
as
a
source
both
of
infinite
blessing
and
of
infinite
danger
on
the
one
hand
the
people
have
to
thank
him
for
the
rain
and
sunshine
which
foster
the
fruits
of
the
earth
for
the
wind
which
brings
ships
to
their
coasts
and
even
for
the
solid
ground
beneath
their
feet
but
what
he
gives
he
can
refuse
and
so
close
is
the
dependence
of
nature
on
his
person
so
delicate
the
balance
of
the
system
of
forces
whereof
he
is
the
centre
that
the
least
irregularity
on
his
part
may
set
up
a
tremor
which
shall
shake
the
earth
to
its
foundations
and
if
nature
may
be
disturbed
by
the
slightest
involuntary
act
of
the
king
it
is
easy
to
conceive
the
convulsion
which
his
death
might
provoke
the
natural
death
of
the
chitomé
as
we
have
seen
was
thought
to
entail
the
destruction
of
all
things
clearly
therefore
out
of
a
regard
for
their
own
safety
which
might
be
imperilled
by
any
rash
act
of
the
king
and
still
more
by
his
death
the
people
will
exact
of
their
king
or
priest
a
strict
conformity
to
those
rules
the
observance
of
which
is
deemed
necessary
for
his
own
preservation
and
consequently
for
the
preservation
of
his
people
and
the
world
the
idea
that
early
kingdoms
are
despotisms
in
which
the
people
exist
only
for
the
sovereign
is
wholly
inapplicable
to
the
monarchies
we
are
considering
on
the
contrary
the
sovereign
in
them
exists
only
for
his
subjects
his
life
is
only
valuable
so
long
as
he
discharges
the
duties
of
his
position
by
ordering
the
course
of
nature
for
his
people
s
benefit
so
soon
as
he
fails
to
do
so
the
care
the
devotion
the
religious
homage
which
they
had
hitherto
lavished
on
him
cease
and
are
changed
into
hatred
and
contempt
he
is
dismissed
ignominiously
and
may
be
thankful
if
he
escapes
with
his
life
worshipped
as
a
god
one
day
he
is
killed
as
a
criminal
the
next
but
in
this
changed
behaviour
of
the
people
there
is
nothing
capricious
or
inconsistent
on
the
contrary
their
conduct
is
entirely
of
a
piece
if
their
king
is
their
god
he
is
or
should
be
also
their
preserver
and
if
he
will
not
preserve
them
he
must
make
room
for
another
who
will
so
long
however
as
he
answers
their
expectations
there
is
no
limit
to
the
care
which
they
take
of
him
and
which
they
compel
him
to
take
of
himself
a
king
of
this
sort
lives
hedged
in
by
a
ceremonious
etiquette
a
network
of
prohibitions
and
observances
of
which
the
intention
is
not
to
contribute
to
his
dignity
much
less
to
his
comfort
but
to
restrain
him
from
conduct
which
by
disturbing
the
harmony
of
nature
might
involve
himself
his
people
and
the
universe
in
one
common
catastrophe
far
from
adding
to
his
comfort
these
observances
by
trammelling
his
every
act
annihilate
his
freedom
and
often
render
the
very
life
which
it
is
their
object
to
preserve
a
burden
and
sorrow
to
him
of
the
supernaturally
endowed
kings
of
loango
it
is
said
that
the
more
powerful
a
king
is
the
more
taboos
is
he
bound
to
observe
they
regulate
all
his
actions
his
walking
and
his
standing
his
eating
and
drinking
his
sleeping
and
waking
to
these
restraints
the
heir
to
the
throne
is
subject
from
infancy
but
as
he
advances
in
life
the
number
of
abstinences
and
ceremonies
which
he
must
observe
increases
until
at
the
moment
that
he
ascends
the
throne
he
is
lost
in
the
ocean
of
rites
and
in
the
crater
of
an
extinct
volcano
enclosed
on
all
sides
by
grassy
slopes
lie
the
scattered
huts
and
of
riabba
the
capital
of
the
native
king
of
fernando
po
this
mysterious
being
lives
in
the
lowest
depths
of
the
crater
surrounded
by
a
harem
of
forty
women
and
covered
it
is
said
with
old
silver
coins
naked
savage
as
he
is
he
yet
exercises
far
more
influence
in
the
island
than
the
spanish
governor
at
santa
isabel
in
him
the
conservative
spirit
of
the
boobies
or
aboriginal
inhabitants
of
the
island
is
as
it
were
incorporate
he
has
never
seen
a
white
man
and
according
to
the
firm
conviction
of
all
the
boobies
the
sight
of
a
pale
face
would
cause
his
instant
death
he
can
not
bear
to
look
upon
the
sea
indeed
it
is
said
that
he
may
never
see
it
even
in
the
distance
and
that
therefore
he
wears
away
his
life
with
shackles
on
his
legs
in
the
dim
twilight
of
his
hut
certain
it
is
that
he
has
never
set
foot
on
the
beach
with
the
exception
of
his
musket
and
knife
he
uses
nothing
that
comes
from
the
whites
european
cloth
never
touches
his
person
and
he
scorns
tobacco
rum
and
even
salt
among
the
peoples
of
the
slave
coast
in
west
africa
the
king
is
at
the
same
time
high
priest
in
this
quality
he
was
particularly
in
former
times
unapproachable
by
his
subjects
only
by
night
was
he
allowed
to
quit
his
dwelling
in
order
to
bathe
and
so
forth
none
but
his
representative
the
visible
king
with
three
chosen
elders
might
converse
with
him
and
even
they
had
to
sit
on
an
with
their
backs
turned
to
him
he
might
not
see
any
european
nor
any
horse
nor
might
he
look
upon
the
sea
for
which
reason
he
was
not
allowed
to
quit
his
capital
even
for
a
few
moments
these
rules
have
been
disregarded
in
recent
the
king
of
dahomey
himself
is
subject
to
the
prohibition
of
beholding
the
sea
and
so
are
the
kings
of
loango
and
great
ardra
in
guinea
the
sea
is
the
fetish
of
the
eyeos
to
the
of
dahomey
and
they
and
their
king
are
threatened
with
death
by
their
priests
if
ever
they
dare
to
look
on
it
it
is
believed
that
the
king
of
cayor
in
senegal
would
infallibly
die
within
the
year
if
he
were
to
cross
a
river
or
an
arm
of
the
sea
in
mashonaland
down
to
recent
times
the
chiefs
would
not
cross
certain
rivers
particularly
the
rurikwi
and
the
nyadiri
and
the
custom
was
still
strictly
observed
by
at
least
one
chief
within
the
last
few
years
on
no
account
will
the
chief
cross
the
river
if
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
him
to
do
so
he
is
blindfolded
and
carried
across
with
shouting
and
singing
should
he
walk
across
he
will
go
blind
or
die
and
certainly
lose
the
so
among
the
mahafalys
and
sakalavas
in
the
south
of
madagascar
some
kings
are
forbidden
to
sail
on
the
sea
or
to
cross
certain
rivers
the
horror
of
the
sea
is
not
peculiar
to
kings
the
basutos
are
said
to
share
it
instinctively
though
they
have
never
seen
salt
water
and
live
hundreds
of
miles
from
the
indian
ocean
the
egyptian
priests
loathed
the
sea
and
called
it
the
foam
of
typhon
they
were
forbidden
to
set
salt
on
their
table
and
they
would
not
speak
to
pilots
because
they
got
their
living
by
the
sea
hence
too
they
would
not
eat
fish
and
the
hieroglyphic
symbol
for
hatred
was
a
fish
when
the
indians
of
the
peruvian
andes
were
sent
by
the
spaniards
to
work
in
the
hot
valleys
of
the
coast
the
vast
ocean
which
they
saw
before
them
as
they
descended
the
cordillera
was
dreaded
by
them
as
a
cause
of
disease
hence
they
prayed
to
it
that
they
might
not
fall
ill
this
they
all
did
without
exception
even
the
little
children
similarly
the
inland
people
of
lampong
in
sumatra
are
said
to
pay
a
kind
of
adoration
to
the
sea
and
to
make
it
an
offering
of
cakes
and
sweetmeats
when
they
behold
it
for
the
first
time
deprecating
its
power
of
doing
them
mischief
among
the
sakalavas
of
southern
madagascar
the
chief
is
regarded
as
a
sacred
being
but
he
is
held
in
leash
by
a
crowd
of
restrictions
which
regulate
his
behaviour
like
that
of
the
emperor
of
china
he
can
undertake
nothing
whatever
unless
the
sorcerers
have
declared
the
omens
favourable
he
may
not
eat
warm
food
on
certain
days
he
may
not
quit
his
hut
and
so
among
some
of
the
hill
tribes
of
assam
both
the
headman
and
his
wife
have
to
observe
many
taboos
in
respect
of
food
thus
they
may
not
eat
buffalo
pork
dog
fowl
or
tomatoes
the
headman
must
be
chaste
the
husband
of
one
wife
and
he
must
separate
himself
from
her
on
the
eve
of
a
general
or
public
observance
of
taboo
in
one
group
of
tribes
the
headman
is
forbidden
to
eat
in
a
strange
village
and
under
no
provocation
whatever
may
he
utter
a
word
of
abuse
apparently
the
people
imagine
that
the
violation
of
any
of
these
taboos
by
a
headman
would
bring
down
misfortune
on
the
whole
village
the
ancient
kings
of
ireland
as
well
as
the
kings
of
the
four
provinces
of
leinster
munster
connaught
and
ulster
were
subject
to
certain
quaint
prohibitions
or
taboos
on
the
due
observance
of
which
the
prosperity
of
the
people
and
the
country
as
well
as
their
own
was
supposed
to
depend
thus
for
example
the
sun
might
not
rise
on
the
king
of
ireland
in
his
bed
at
tara
the
old
capital
of

he

to

between
two
darknesses
if
the
kings
of
ireland
strictly
observed
these
and
many
other
customs
which
were
enjoined
by
immemorial
usage
it
was
believed
that
they
would
never
meet
with
mischance
or
misfortune
and
would
live
for
ninety
years
without
experiencing
the
decay
of
old
age
that
no
epidemic
or
mortality
would
occur
during
their
reigns
and
that
the
seasons
would
be
favourable
and
the
earth
yield
its
fruit
in
abundance
whereas
if
they
set
the
ancient
usages
at
naught
the
country
would
be
visited
with
plague
famine
and
bad
weather
the
kings
of
egypt
were
worshipped
as
gods
and
the
routine
of
their
daily
life
was
regulated
in
every
detail
by
precise
and
unvarying
rules
the
life
of
the
kings
of
egypt
says
diodorus
was
not
like
that
of
other
monarchs
who
are
irresponsible
and
may
do
just
what
they
choose
on
the
contrary
everything
was
fixed
for
them
by
law
not
only
their
official
duties
but
even
the
details
of
their
daily
life
the
hours
both
of
day
and
night
were
arranged
at
which
the
king
had
to
do
not
what
he
pleased
but
what
was
prescribed
for
him
for
not
only
were
the
times
appointed
at
which
he
should
transact
public
business
or
sit
in
judgment
but
the
very
hours
for
his
walking
and
bathing
and
sleeping
with
his
wife
and
in
short
performing
every
act
of
life
were
all
settled
custom
enjoined
a
simple
diet
the
only
flesh
he
might
eat
was
veal
and
goose
and
he
might
only
drink
a
prescribed
quantity
of
however
there
is
reason
to
think
that
these
rules
were
observed
not
by
the
ancient
pharaohs
but
by
the
priestly
kings
who
reigned
at
thebes
and
in
ethiopia
at
the
close
of
the
twentieth
dynasty
among
the
of
upper
burma
a
chief
attains
his
position
not
by
hereditary
right
but
on
account
of
his
habit
of
abstaining
from
rice
and
liquor
the
mother
too
of
a
candidate
for
the
chieftainship
must
have
eschewed
these
things
and
lived
solely
on
yams
and
potatoes
so
long
as
she
was
with
child
during
that
time
she
may
not
eat
any
meat
nor
drink
water
from
a
common
well
and
if
her
son
is
to
be
qualified
for
the
office
of
chief
he
must
continue
to
observe
these
habits
of
the
taboos
imposed
on
priests
we
may
see
a
striking
example
in
the
rules
of
life
prescribed
for
the
flamen
dialis
at
rome
who
has
been
interpreted
as
a
living
image
of
jupiter
or
a
human
embodiment
of
the
they
were
such
as
the
following
flamen
dialis
might
not
ride
or
even
touch
a
horse
nor
see
an
army
under
arms
nor
wear
a
ring
which
was
not
broken
nor
have
a
knot
on
any
part
of
his
garments
no
fire
except
a
sacred
fire
might
be
taken
out
of
his
house
he
might
not
touch
wheaten
flour
or
leavened
bread
he
might
not
touch
or
even
name
a
goat
a
dog
raw
meat
beans
and
ivy
he
might
not
walk
under
a
vine
the
feet
of
his
bed
had
to
be
daubed
with
mud
his
hair
could
be
cut
only
by
a
free
man
and
with
a
bronze
knife
and
his
hair
and
nails
when
cut
had
to
be
buried
under
a
lucky
tree
he
might
not
touch
a
dead
body
nor
enter
a
place
where
one
was
burned
he
might
not
see
work
being
done
on
holy
days
he
might
not
be
uncovered
in
the
open
air
if
a
man
in
bonds
were
taken
into
his
house
the
captive
had
to
be
unbound
and
the
cords
had
to
be
drawn
up
through
a
hole
in
the
roof
and
so
let
down
into
the
street
his
wife
the
flaminica
had
to
observe
nearly
the
same
rules
and
others
of
her
own
besides
she
might
not
ascend
more
than
three
steps
of
the
kind
of
staircase
called
greek
at
a
certain
festival
she
might
not
comb
her
hair
the
leather
of
her
shoes
might
not
be
made
from
a
beast
that
had
died
a
natural
death
but
only
from
one
that
had
been
slain
or
sacrificed
if
she
heard
thunder
she
was
tabooed
till
she
had
offered
an
expiatory
sacrifice
among
the
grebo
people
of
sierra
leone
there
is
a
pontiff
who
bears
the
title
of
bodia
and
has
been
compared
on
somewhat
slender
grounds
to
the
high
priest
of
the
jews
he
is
appointed
in
accordance
with
the
behest
of
an
oracle
at
an
elaborate
ceremony
of
installation
he
is
anointed
a
ring
is
put
on
his
ankle
as
a
badge
of
office
and
the
of
his
house
are
sprinkled
with
the
blood
of
a
sacrificed
goat
he
has
charge
of
the
public
talismans
and
idols
which
he
feeds
with
rice
and
oil
every
new
moon
and
he
sacrifices
on
behalf
of
the
town
to
the
dead
and
to
demons
nominally
his
power
is
very
great
but
in
practice
it
is
very
limited
for
he
dare
not
defy
public
opinion
and
he
is
held
responsible
even
with
his
life
for
any
adversity
that
befalls
the
country
it
is
expected
of
him
that
he
should
cause
the
earth
to
bring
forth
abundantly
the
people
to
be
healthy
war
to
be
driven
far
away
and
witchcraft
to
be
kept
in
abeyance
his
life
is
trammelled
by
the
observance
of
certain
restrictions
or
taboos
thus
he
may
not
sleep
in
any
house
but
his
own
official
residence
which
is
called
the
anointed
house
with
reference
to
the
ceremony
of
anointing
him
at
inauguration
he
may
not
drink
water
on
the
highway
he
may
not
eat
while
a
corpse
is
in
the
town
and
he
may
not
mourn
for
the
dead
if
he
dies
while
in
office
he
must
be
buried
at
dead
of
night
few
may
hear
of
his
burial
and
none
may
mourn
for
him
when
his
death
is
made
public
should
he
have
fallen
a
victim
to
the
poison
ordeal
by
drinking
a
decoction
of
sassywood
as
it
is
called
he
must
be
buried
under
a
running
stream
of
water
among
the
todas
of
southern
india
the
holy
milkman
who
acts
as
priest
of
the
sacred
dairy
is
subject
to
a
variety
of
irksome
and
burdensome
restrictions
during
the
whole
time
of
his
incumbency
which
may
last
many
years
thus
he
must
live
at
the
sacred
dairy
and
may
never
visit
his
home
or
any
ordinary
village
he
must
be
celibate
if
he
is
married
he
must
leave
his
wife
on
no
account
may
any
ordinary
person
touch
the
holy
milkman
or
the
holy
dairy
such
a
touch
would
so
defile
his
holiness
that
he
would
forfeit
his
office
it
is
only
on
two
days
a
week
namely
mondays
and
thursdays
that
a
mere
layman
may
even
approach
the
milkman
on
other
days
if
he
has
any
business
with
him
he
must
stand
at
a
distance
some
say
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
shout
his
message
across
the
intervening
space
further
the
holy
milkman
never
cuts
his
hair
or
pares
his
nails
so
long
as
he
holds
office
he
never
crosses
a
river
by
a
bridge
but
wades
through
a
ford
and
only
certain
fords
if
a
death
occurs
in
his
clan
he
may
not
attend
any
of
the
funeral
ceremonies
unless
he
first
resigns
his
office
and
descends
from
the
exalted
rank
of
milkman
to
that
of
a
mere
common
mortal
indeed
it
appears
that
in
old
days
he
had
to
resign
the
seals
or
rather
the
pails
of
office
whenever
any
member
of
his
clan
departed
this
life
however
these
heavy
restraints
are
laid
in
their
entirety
only
on
milkmen
of
the
very
highest
class
among
the
todas
there
are
milkmen
and
milkmen
and
some
of
them
get
off
more
lightly
in
consideration
of
their
humbler
station
in
life
still
apart
from
the
dignity
they
enjoy
the
lot
even
of
these
other
milkmen
is
not
altogether
a
happy
one
thus
for
example
at
a
place
called
kanodrs
there
is
a
of
a
conical
form
the
milkman
who
has
charge
of
it
must
be
celibate
during
the
tenure
of
his
office
he
must
sleep
in
the
calves
house
a
very
flimsy
structure
with
an
open
door
and
a
that
gives
little
heat
he
may
wear
only
one
very
scanty
garment
he
must
take
his
meals
sitting
on
the
outer
wall
which
surrounds
the
dairy
in
eating
he
may
not
put
his
hand
to
his
lips
but
must
throw
the
food
into
his
mouth
and
in
drinking
he
may
not
put
to
his
lips
the
leaf
which
serves
as
a
cup
he
must
tilt
his
head
back
and
pour
the
liquid
into
his
mouth
in
a
jet
from
above
with
the
exception
of
a
single
layman
who
is
allowed
to
bear
the
milkman
company
but
who
is
also
bound
to
celibacy
and
has
a
bed
rigged
up
for
him
in
the
calves
house
no
other
person
is
allowed
to
go
near
this
very
sacred
dairy
under
any
pretext
whatever
no
wonder
that
some
years
ago
the
dairy
was
unoccupied
and
the
office
of
milkman
stood
vacant
at
the
present
time
says
rivers
a
dairyman
is
appointed
about
once
a
year
and
holds
office
for
thirty
or
forty
days
only
so
far
as
i
could
ascertain
the
failure
to
occupy
the
dairy
constantly
is
due
to
the
very
considerable
hardships
and
restrictions
which
have
to
be
endured
by
the
holder
of
the
office
of
dairyman
and
the
time
is
probably
not
far
distant
when
this
dairy
one
of
the
most
sacred
among
the
todas
will
cease
altogether
to
be
divorce
of
the
spiritual
from
the
temporal
power
the
burdensome
observances
attached
to
the
royal
or
priestly
office
produced
their
natural
effect
either
men
refused
to
accept
the
office
which
hence
tended
to
fall
into
abeyance
or
accepting
it
they
sank
under
its
weight
into
spiritless
creatures
cloistered
recluses
from
whose
nerveless
fingers
the
reins
of
government
slipped
into
the
firmer
grasp
of
men
who
were
often
content
to
wield
the
reality
of
sovereignty
without
its
name
in
some
countries
this
rift
in
the
supreme
power
deepened
into
a
total
and
permanent
separation
of
the
spiritual
and
temporal
powers
the
old
royal
house
retaining
their
purely
religious
functions
while
the
civil
government
passed
into
the
hands
of
a
younger
and
more
vigorous
race
to
take
examples
in
a
previous
part
of
this
work
we
saw
that
in
cambodia
it
is
often
necessary
to
force
the
kingships
of
fire
and
water
upon
the
reluctant
successors
and
that
in
savage
island
the
monarchy
actually
came
to
an
end
because
at
last
no
one
could
be
induced
to
accept
the
dangerous
distinction
in
some
parts
of
west
africa
when
the
king
dies
a
family
council
is
secretly
held
to
determine
his
successor
he
on
whom
the
choice
falls
is
suddenly
seized
bound
and
thrown
into
the
where
he
is
kept
in
durance
till
he
consents
to
accept
the
crown
sometimes
the
heir
finds
means
of
evading
the
honour
which
it
is
sought
to
thrust
upon
him
a
ferocious
chief
has
been
known
to
go
about
constantly
armed
resolute
to
resist
by
force
any
attempt
to
set
him
on
the
throne
the
savage
timmes
of
sierra
leone
who
elect
their
king
reserve
to
themselves
the
right
of
beating
him
on
the
eve
of
his
coronation
and
they
avail
themselves
of
this
constitutional
privilege
with
such
hearty
goodwill
that
sometimes
the
unhappy
monarch
does
not
long
survive
his
elevation
to
the
throne
hence
when
the
leading
chiefs
have
a
spite
at
a
man
and
wish
to
rid
themselves
of
him
they
elect
him
king
formerly
before
a
man
was
proclaimed
king
of
sierra
leone
it
used
to
be
the
custom
to
load
him
with
chains
and
thrash
him
then
the
fetters
were
knocked
off
the
kingly
robe
was
placed
on
him
and
he
received
in
his
hands
the
symbol
of
royal
dignity
which
was
nothing
but
the
axe
of
the
executioner
it
is
not
therefore
surprising
to
read
that
in
sierra
leone
where
such
customs
have
prevailed
except
among
the
mandingoes
and
suzees
few
kings
are
natives
of
the
countries
they
govern
so
different
are
their
ideas
from
ours
that
very
few
are
solicitous
of
the
honour
and
competition
is
very
seldom
heard
another
writer
on
sierra
leone
tells
us
that
the
honour
of
reigning
so
much
coveted
in
europe
is
very
frequently
rejected
in
africa
on
account
of
the
expense
attached
to
it
which
sometimes
greatly
exceeds
the
revenues
of
the
a
reluctance
to
accept
the
sovereignty
in
the
ethiopian
kingdom
of
gingiro
was
simulated
if
not
really
felt
as
we
learn
from
the
old
jesuit
missionaries
they
wrap
up
the
dead
king
s
body
in
costly
garments
and
killing
a
cow
put
it
into
the
hide
then
all
those
who
hope
to
succeed
him
being
his
sons
or
others
of
the
royal
blood
flying
from
the
honour
they
covet
abscond
and
hide
themselves
in
the
woods
this
done
the
electors
who
are
all
great
sorcerers
agree
among
themselves
who
shall
be
king
and
go
out
to
seek
him
when
entering
the
woods
by
means
of
their
enchantments
they
say
a
large
bird
called
as
big
as
an
eagle
comes
down
with
mighty
cries
over
the
place
where
he
is
hid
and
they
find
him
encompass
d
by
lyons
tygers
snakes
and
other
creatures
gather
d
about
him
by
witchcraft
the
elect
as
fierce
as
those
beasts
rushes
out
upon
those
who
seek
him
wounding
and
sometimes
killing
some
of
them
to
prevent
being
seiz
d
they
take
all
in
good
part
defending
themselves
the
best
they
can
till
they
have
seiz
d
him
thus
they
carry
him
away
by
force
he
still
struggling
and
seeming
to
refuse
taking
upon
him
the
burthen
of
government
all
which
is
mere
cheat
and
the
mikados
of
japan
seem
early
to
have
resorted
to
the
expedient
of
transferring
the
honours
and
burdens
of
supreme
power
to
their
infant
children
and
the
rise
of
the
tycoons
long
the
temporal
sovereigns
of
the
country
is
traced
to
the
abdication
of
a
certain
mikado
in
favour
of
his
son
the
sovereignty
having
been
wrested
by
a
usurper
from
the
infant
prince
the
cause
of
the
mikado
was
championed
by
yoritomo
a
man
of
spirit
and
conduct
who
overthrew
the
usurper
and
restored
to
the
mikado
the
shadow
while
he
retained
for
himself
the
substance
of
power
he
bequeathed
to
his
descendants
the
dignity
he
had
won
and
thus
became
the
founder
of
the
line
of
tycoons
down
to
the
latter
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
tycoons
were
active
and
efficient
rulers
but
the
same
fate
overtook
them
which
had
befallen
the
mikados
immeshed
in
the
same
inextricable
web
of
custom
and
law
they
degenerated
into
mere
puppets
hardly
stirring
from
their
palaces
and
occupied
in
a
perpetual
round
of
empty
ceremonies
while
the
real
business
of
government
was
managed
by
the
council
of
state
in
tonquin
the
monarchy
ran
a
similar
course
living
like
his
predecessors
in
effeminacy
and
sloth
the
king
was
driven
from
the
throne
by
an
ambitious
adventurer
named
mack
who
from
a
fisherman
had
risen
to
be
grand
mandarin
but
the
king
s
brother
tring
put
down
the
usurper
and
restored
the
king
retaining
however
for
himself
and
his
descendants
the
dignity
of
general
of
all
the
forces
thenceforward
the
kings
or
though
invested
with
the
title
and
pomp
of
sovereignty
ceased
to
govern
while
they
lived
secluded
in
their
palaces
all
real
political
power
was
wielded
by
the
hereditary
generals
or
the
present
king
of
sikhim
like
most
of
his
predecessors
in
the
kingship
is
a
mere
puppet
in
the
hands
of
his
crafty
priests
who
have
made
a
sort
of
of
him
they
encourage
him
by
every
means
in
their
power
to
leave
the
government
to
them
whilst
he
devotes
all
his
time
to
the
degrading
rites
of
and
the
ceaseless
muttering
of
meaningless
jargon
of
which
the
tibetan
form
of
buddhism
chiefly
consists
they
declare
that
he
is
a
saint
by
birth
that
he
is
the
direct
descendant
of
the
greatest
king
of
tibet
the
canonised
srongtsan
gampo
who
was
a
contemporary
of
mahomed
in
the
seventh
century
and
who
first
introduced
buddhism
to
this
saintly
lineage
which
secures
for
the
king
s
person
popular
homage
amounting
to
worship
is
probably
however
a
mere
invention
of
the
priests
to
glorify
their
for
their
own
sordid
ends
such
devices
are
common
in
the
the
custom
regularly
observed
by
the
tahitian
kings
of
abdicating
on
the
birth
of
a
son
who
was
immediately
proclaimed
sovereign
and
received
his
father
s
homage
may
perhaps
have
originated
like
the
similar
custom
occasionally
practised
by
the
mikados
in
a
wish
to
shift
to
other
shoulders
the
irksome
burden
of
royalty
for
in
tahiti
as
elsewhere
the
sovereign
was
subjected
to
a
system
of
vexatious
restrictions
in
mangaia
another
polynesian
island
religious
and
civil
authority
were
lodged
in
separate
hands
spiritual
functions
being
discharged
by
a
line
of
hereditary
kings
while
the
temporal
government
was
entrusted
from
time
to
time
to
a
victorious
whose
investiture
however
had
to
be
completed
by
the
king
to
the
latter
were
assigned
the
best
lands
and
he
received
daily
offerings
of
the
choicest
food
the
mikado
and
tycoon
of
japan
had
their
counterparts
in
the
roko
tui
and
vunivalu
of
fiji
the
roko
tui

the

all
power
in
his
own
hands
but
in
a
neighbouring
kingdom
the
real
ruler
was
the
sacred
king
similarly
in
tonga
besides
the
civil
king
or
whose
right
to
the
throne
was
partly
hereditary
and
partly
derived
from
his
warlike
reputation
and
the
number
of
his
fighting
men
there
was
a
great
divine
chief
called
or
chief
of
tonga
who
ranked
above
the
king
and
the
other
chiefs
in
virtue
of
his
supposed
descent
from
one
of
the
chief
gods
once
a
year
the
of
the
ground
were
offered
to
him
at
a
solemn
ceremony
and
it
was
believed
that
if
these
offerings
were
not
made
the
vengeance
of
the
gods
would
fall
in
a
signal
manner
on
the
people
peculiar
forms
of
speech
such
as
were
applied
to
no
one
else
were
used
in
speaking
of
him
and
everything
that
he
chanced
to
touch
became
sacred
or
tabooed
when
he
and
the
king
met
the
monarch
had
to
sit
down
on
the
ground
in
token
of
respect
until
his
holiness
had
passed
by
yet
though
he
enjoyed
the
highest
veneration
by
reason
of
his
divine
origin
this
sacred
personage
possessed
no
political
authority
and
if
he
ventured
to
meddle
with
affairs
of
state
it
was
at
the
risk
of
receiving
a
rebuff
from
the
king
to
whom
the
real
power
belonged
and
who
finally
succeeded
in
ridding
himself
of
his
spiritual
rival
the
king
of
the
getae
regularly
shared
his
power
with
a
priest
whom
his
subjects
called
a
god
this
divine
man
led
a
solitary
life
in
a
cave
on
a
holy
mountain
seeing
few
people
but
the
king
and
his
attendants
his
counsels
added
much
to
the
king
s
influence
with
his
subjects
who
believed
that
he
was
thereby
enabled
to
impart
to
them
the
commands
and
admonitions
of
the
gods
at
athens
the
kings
degenerated
into
little
more
than
sacred
functionaries
and
it
is
said
that
the
institution
of
the
new
office
of
polemarch
or
war
lord
was
rendered
necessary
by
their
growing
effeminacy
american
examples
of
the
partition
of
authority
between
a
king
and
a
pope
have
already
been
cited
from
the
early
history
of
mexico
and
colombia
in
some
parts
of
western
africa
two
kings
reign
side
by
side
a
fetish
or
religious
king
and
a
civil
king
but
the
fetish
king
is
really
supreme
he
controls
the
weather
and
so
forth
and
can
put
a
stop
to
everything
when
he
lays
his
red
staff
on
the
ground
no
one
may
pass
that
way
this
division
of
power
between
a
sacred
and
a
secular
ruler
is
to
be
met
with
wherever
the
true
negro
culture
has
been
left
unmolested
but
where
the
negro
form
of
society
has
been
disturbed
as
in
dahomey
and
ashantee
there
is
a
tendency
to
consolidate
the
two
powers
in
a
single
king
thus
for
example
there
used
to
be
a
fetish
king
at
new
calabar
who
ranked
above
the
ordinary
king
in
all
native
matters
whether
religious
or
civil
and
always
walked
in
front
of
him
on
public
occasions
attended
by
a
slave
who
held
an
umbrella
over
his
head
his
opinion
carried
great
weight
the
office
and
the
causes
which
led
to
its
extinction
are
thus
described
by
a
missionary
who
spent
many
years
in
calabar
the
worship
of
the
people
is
now
given
especially
to
their
various
one
of
which
called
ndem
efik
is
a
sort
of
tutelary
deity
of
the
country
an
individual
was
appointed
to
take
charge
of
this
object
of
worship
who
bore
the
name
of
king
calabar
and
likely
in
bypast
times
possessed
the
power
indicated
by
the
title
being
both
king
and
priest
he
had
as
a
tribute
the
skins
of
all
leopards
killed
and
should
a
slave
take
refuge
in
his
shrine
he
belonged
to
ndem
efik
the
office
however
imposed
certain
restrictions
on
its
occupant
he
for
instance
could
not
partake
of
food
in
the
presence
of
any
one
and
he
was
prohibited
from
engaging
in
traffic
on
account
of
these
and
other
disabilities
when
the
last
holder
of
the
office
died
a
poor
old
man
of
the
cobham
family
no
successor
was
found
for
him
and
the
priesthood
has
become
one
of
the
practical
inconveniences
of
such
an
office
is
that
the
house
of
the
fetish
king
enjoys
the
right
of
sanctuary
and
so
tends
to
become
little
better
than
a
rookery
of
bad
characters
thus
on
the
grain
coast
of
west
africa
the
fetish
king
or
bodio
as
he
is
called
exercises
the
functions
of
a
and
is
regarded
as
protector
of
the
whole
nation
he
lives
in
a
house
provided
for
him
by
the
people
and
takes
care
of
the
national
fetiches
he
enjoys
some
immunities
in
virtue
of
his
office
but
is
subject
to
certain
restrictions
which
more
than
counterbalance
his
privileges
his
house
is
a
sanctum
to
which
culprits
may
betake
themselves
without
the
danger
of
being
removed
by
any
one
except
by
the
bodio
one
of
these
bodios
resigned
office
because
of
the
sort
of
people
who
quartered
themselves
on
him
the
cost
of
feeding
them
and
the
squabbles
they
had
among
themselves
he
led
a
life
with
them
for
three
years
then
there
came
a
man
with
homicidal
mania
varied
by
epileptic
fits
and
soon
afterwards
the
spiritual
shepherd
retired
into
private
life
but
not
before
he
had
lost
an
ear
and
sustained
other
bodily
injury
in
a
personal
conflict
with
this
very
black
sheep
at
porto
novo
there
used
to
be
in
addition
to
the
ordinary
monarch
a
king
of
the
night
who
reigned
during
the
hours
of
darkness
from
sunset
to
sunrise
he
might
not
shew
himself
in
the
street
after
the
sun
was
up
his
duty
was
to
patrol
the
streets
with
his
satellites
and
to
arrest
all
whom
he
found
abroad
after
a
certain
hour
each
band
of
his
catchpoles
was
led
by
a
man
who
went
about
concealed
from
head
to
foot
under
a
conical
casing
of
straw
and
blew
blasts
on
a
shell
which
caused
every
one
that
heard
it
to
shudder
the
king
of
the
night
never
met
the
ordinary
king
except
on
the
first
and
last
days
of
their
respective
reign
for
each
of
them
invested
the
other
with
office
and
paid
him
the
last
honours
at
death
with
this
king
of
the
night
at
porto
novo
we
may
compare
a
certain
king
of
hawaii
who
was
so
very
sacred
that
no
man
might
see
him
even
accidentally
by
day
under
pain
of
death
he
only
shewed
himself
by
night
in
some
parts
of
the
east
indian
island
of
timor
we
meet
with
a
partition
of
power
like
that
which
is
represented
by
the
civil
king
and
the
fetish
king
of
western
africa
some
of
the
timorese
tribes
recognise
two
rajahs
the
ordinary
or
civil
rajah
who
governs
the
people
and
the
fetish
or
taboo
rajah
who
is
charged
with
the
control
of
everything
that
concerns
the
earth
and
its
products
this
latter
ruler
has
the
right
of
declaring
anything
taboo
his
permission
must
be
obtained
before
new
land
may
be
brought
under
cultivation
and
he
must
perform
certain
necessary
ceremonies
when
the
work
is
being
carried
out
if
drought
or
blight
threatens
the
crops
his
help
is
invoked
to
save
them
though
he
ranks
below
the
civil
rajah
he
exercises
a
momentous
influence
on
the
course
of
events
for
his
secular
colleague
is
bound
to
consult
him
in
all
important
matters
in
some
of
the
neighbouring
islands
such
as
rotti
and
eastern
flores
a
spiritual
ruler
of
the
same
sort
is
recognised
under
various
native
names
which
all
mean
lord
of
the
similarly
in
the
mekeo
district
of
british
new
guinea
there
is
a
double
chieftainship
the
people
are
divided
into
two
groups
according
to
families
and
each
of
the
groups
has
its
chief
one
of
the
two
is
the
war
chief
the
other
is
the
taboo
chief
the
office
of
the
latter
is
hereditary
his
duty
is
to
impose
a
taboo
on
any
of
the
crops
such
as
the
and
areca
nuts
whenever
he
thinks
it
desirable
to
prohibit
their
use
in
his
office
we
may
perhaps
detect
the
beginning
of
a
priestly
dynasty
but
as
yet
his
functions
appear
to
be
more
magical
than
religious
being
concerned
with
the
control
of
the
harvests
rather
than
with
the
propitiation
of
higher
powers
the
members
of
another
family
are
bound
to
see
to
it
that
the
taboo
imposed
by
the
chief
is
strictly
observed
for
this
purpose
some
fourteen
or
fifteen
men
of
the
family
form
a
sort
of
constabulary
every
evening
they
go
round
the
village
armed
with
clubs
and
disguised
with
masks
or
leaves
all
the
time
they
are
in
office
they
are
forbidden
to
live
with
their
wives
and
even
to
look
at
a
woman
hence
women
may
not
quit
their
houses
while
the
men
are
going
their
rounds
further
the
constables
on
duty
are
prohibited
from
chewing
betel
nut
and
drinking
water
lest
the
areca
and
should
not
grow
when
there
is
a
good
show
of
nuts
the
taboo
chief
proclaims
that
on
a
certain
day
the
restriction
will
come
to
an
end
in
ponape
one
of
the
caroline
islands
the
kingship
is
elective
within
the
limits
of
the
blood
royal
which
runs
in
the
female
line
so
that
the
sovereignty
passes
backwards
and
forwards
between
families
which
we
reckoning
descent
in
the
male
line
should
regard
as
distinct
the
chosen
monarch
must
be
in
possession
of
certain
secrets
he
must
know
the
places
where
the
sacred
stones
are
kept
on
which
he
has
to
seat
himself
he
must
understand
the
holy
words
and
prayers
of
the
liturgy
and
after
his
election
he
must
recite
them
at
the
place
of
the
sacred
stones
but
he
enjoys
only
the
honours
of
his
office
the
real
powers
of
government
are
in
the
hands
of
his
or
vizier
chapter
ii
the
perils
of
the
soul
the
soul
as
a
mannikin
the
foregoing
examples
have
taught
us
that
the
office
of
a
sacred
king
or
priest
is
often
hedged
in
by
a
series
of
burdensome
restrictions
or
taboos
of
which
a
principal
purpose
appears
to
be
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
divine
man
for
the
good
of
his
people
but
if
the
object
of
the
taboos
is
to
save
his
life
the
question
arises
how
is
their
observance
supposed
to
effect
this
end
to
understand
this
we
must
know
the
nature
of
the
danger
which
threatens
the
king
s
life
and
which
it
is
the
intention
of
these
curious
restrictions
to
guard
against
we
must
therefore
ask
what
does
early
man
understand
by
death
to
what
causes
does
he
attribute
it
and
how
does
he
think
it
may
be
guarded
against
as
the
savage
commonly
explains
the
processes
of
inanimate
nature
by
supposing
that
they
are
produced
by
living
beings
working
in
or
behind
the
phenomena
so
he
explains
the
phenomena
of
life
itself
if
an
animal
lives
and
moves
it
can
only
be
he
thinks
because
there
is
a
little
animal
inside
which
moves
it
if
a
man
lives
and
moves
it
can
only
be
because
he
has
a
little
man
or
animal
inside
who
moves
him
the
animal
inside
the
animal
the
man
inside
the
man
is
the
soul
and
as
the
activity
of
an
animal
or
man
is
explained
by
the
presence
of
the
soul
so
the
repose
of
sleep
or
death
is
explained
by
its
absence
sleep
or
trance
being
the
temporary
death
being
the
permanent
absence
of
the
soul
hence
if
death
be
the
permanent
absence
of
the
soul
the
way
to
guard
against
it
is
either
to
prevent
the
soul
from
leaving
the
body
or
if
it
does
depart
to
ensure
that
it
shall
return
the
precautions
adopted
by
savages
to
secure
one
or
other
of
these
ends
take
the
form
of
certain
prohibitions
or
taboos
which
are
nothing
but
rules
intended
to
ensure
either
the
continued
presence
or
the
return
of
the
soul
in
short
they
are
or
these
general
statements
will
now
be
illustrated
by
examples
addressing
some
australian
blacks
a
european
missionary
said
i
am
not
one
as
you
think
but
upon
this
they
laughed
you
may
laugh
as
much
as
you
like
continued
the
missionary
i
tell
you
that
i
am
two
in
one
this
great
body
that
you
see
is
one
within
that
there
is
another
little
one
which
is
not
visible
the
great
body
dies
and
is
buried
but
the
little
body
flies
away
when
the
great
one
to
this
some
of
the
blacks
replied
yes
yes
we
also
are
two
we
also
have
a
little
body
within
the
on
being
asked
where
the
little
body
went
after
death
some
said
it
went
behind
the
bush
others
said
it
went
into
the
sea
and
some
said
they
did
not
know
the
hurons
thought
that
the
soul
had
a
head
and
body
arms
and
legs
in
short
that
it
was
a
complete
little
model
of
the
man
himself
the
esquimaux
believe
that
the
soul
exhibits
the
same
shape
as
the
body
it
belongs
to
but
is
of
a
more
subtle
and
ethereal
according
to
the
nootkas
of
british
columbia
the
soul
has
the
shape
of
a
tiny
man
its
seat
is
the
crown
of
the
head
so
long
as
it
stands
erect
its
owner
is
hale
and
hearty
but
when
from
any
cause
it
loses
its
upright
position
he
loses
his
senses
among
the
indian
tribes
of
the
lower
fraser
river
man
is
held
to
have
four
souls
of
which
the
principal
one
has
the
form
of
a
mannikin
while
the
other
three
are
shadows
of
it
the
malays
conceive
the
human
soul
as
a
little
man
mostly
invisible
and
of
the
bigness
of
a
thumb
who
corresponds
exactly
in
shape
proportion
and
even
in
complexion
to
the
man
in
whose
body
he
resides
this
mannikin
is
of
a
thin
unsubstantial
nature
though
not
so
impalpable
but
that
it
may
cause
displacement
on
entering
a
physical
object
and
it
can
flit
quickly
from
place
to
place
it
is
temporarily
absent
from
the
body
in
sleep
trance
and
disease
and
permanently
absent
after
death
the
ancient
egyptians
believed
that
every
man
has
a
soul
which
is
his
exact
counterpart
or
double
with
the
same
features
the
same
gait
even
the
same
dress
as
the
man
himself
many
of
the
monuments
dating
from
the
eighteenth
century
onwards
represent
various
kings
appearing
before
divinities
while
behind
the
king
stands
his
soul
or
double
portrayed
as
a
little
man
with
the
king
s
features
some
of
the
reliefs
in
the
temple
at
luxor
illustrate
the
birth
of
king
amenophis
iii
while
the
is
being
tended
by
two
goddesses
acting
as
midwives
two
other
goddesses
are
bringing
away
two
figures
of
children
only
one
of
which
is
supposed
to
be
a
child
of
flesh
and
blood
the
inscriptions
engraved
above
their
heads
shew
that
while
the
first
is
amenophis
the
second
is
his
soul
or
double
and
as
with
kings
and
queens
so
it
was
with
common
men
and
women
whenever
a
child
was
born
there
was
born
with
him
a
double
which
followed
him
through
the
various
stages
of
life
young
while
he
was
young
it
grew
to
maturity
and
declined
along
with
him
and
not
only
human
beings
but
gods
and
animals
stones
and
trees
natural
and
artificial
objects
everybody
and
everything
had
its
own
soul
or
double
the
doubles
of
oxen
and
sheep
were
the
duplicates
of
the
original
oxen
or
sheep
the
doubles
of
linen
or
beds
of
chairs
or
knives
had
the
same
form
as
the
real
linen
beds
chairs
and
knives
so
thin
and
subtle
was
the
stuff
so
fine
and
delicate
the
texture
of
these
doubles
that
they
made
no
impression
on
ordinary
eyes
only
certain
classes
of
priests
or
seers
were
enabled
by
natural
gifts
or
special
training
to
perceive
the
doubles
of
the
gods
and
to
win
from
them
a
knowledge
of
the
past
and
the
future
the
doubles
of
men
and
things
were
hidden
from
sight
in
the
ordinary
course
of
life
still
they
sometimes
flew
out
of
the
body
endowed
with
colour
and
voice
left
it
in
a
kind
of
trance
and
departed
to
manifest
themselves
at
a
distance
so
exact
is
the
resemblance
of
the
mannikin
to
the
man
in
other
words
of
the
soul
to
the
body
that
as
there
are
fat
bodies
and
thin
bodies
so
there
are
fat
souls
and
thin
souls
as
there
are
heavy
bodies
and
light
bodies
long
bodies
and
short
bodies
so
there
are
heavy
souls
and
light
souls
long
souls
and
short
souls
the
people
of
nias
an
island
to
the
west
of
sumatra
think
that
every
man
before
he
is
born
is
asked
how
long
or
how
heavy
a
soul
he
would
like
and
a
soul
of
the
desired
weight
or
length
is
measured
out
to
him
the
heaviest
soul
ever
given
out
weighs
about
ten
grammes
the
length
of
a
man
s
life
is
proportioned
to
the
length
of
his
soul
children
who
die
young
had
short
souls
the
fijian
conception
of
the
soul
as
a
tiny
human
being
comes
clearly
out
in
the
customs
observed
at
the
death
of
a
chief
among
the
nakelo
tribe
when
a
chief
dies
certain
men
who
are
the
hereditary
undertakers
call
him
as
he
lies
oiled
and
ornamented
on
fine
mats
saying
rise
sir
the
chief
and
let
us
be
going
the
day
has
come
over
the
then
they
conduct
him
to
the
river
side
where
the
ghostly
ferryman
comes
to
ferry
nakelo
ghosts
across
the
stream
as
they
thus
attend
the
chief
on
his
last
journey
they
hold
their
great
fans
close
to
the
ground
to
shelter
him
because
as
one
of
them
explained
to
a
missionary
his
soul
is
only
a
little
people
in
the
punjaub
who
tattoo
themselves
believe
that
at
death
the
soul
the
little
entire
man
or
woman
inside
the
mortal
frame
will
go
to
heaven
blazoned
with
the
same
tattoo
patterns
which
adorned
the
body
in
life
sometimes
however
as
we
shall
see
the
human
soul
is
conceived
not
in
human
but
in
animal
form
absence
and
recall
of
the
soul
the
soul
is
commonly
supposed
to
escape
by
the
natural
openings
of
the
body
especially
the
mouth
and
nostrils
hence
in
celebes
they
sometimes
fasten
fishhooks
to
a
sick
man
s
nose
navel
and
feet
so
that
if
his
soul
should
try
to
escape
it
may
be
hooked
and
held
fast
a
turik
on
the
baram
river
in
borneo
refused
to
part
with
some
stones
because
they
as
it
were
hooked
his
soul
to
his
body
and
so
prevented
the
spiritual
portion
of
him
from
becoming
detached
from
the
material
when
a
sea
dyak
sorcerer
or
is
initiated
his
fingers
are
supposed
to
be
furnished
with
with
which
he
will
thereafter
clutch
the
human
soul
in
the
act
of
flying
away
and
restore
it
to
the
body
of
the
sufferer
but
hooks
it
is
plain
may
be
used
to
catch
the
souls
of
enemies
as
well
as
of
friends
acting
on
this
principle
in
borneo
hang
wooden
hooks
beside
the
skulls
of
their
slain
enemies
in
the
belief
that
this
helps
them
on
their
forays
to
hook
in
fresh
heads
when
an
epidemic
is
raging
the
goajiro
indians
of
colombia
attribute
it
to
an
evil
spirit
it
may
be
the
prowling
ghost
of
an
enemy
so
they
hang
strings
furnished
with
hooks
from
the
roofs
of
their
huts
and
from
all
the
trees
in
the
neighbourhood
in
order
that
the
demon
or
ghost
may
be
caught
on
a
hook
and
thus
rendered
powerless
to
harm
them
similarly
the
calchaquis
indians
to
the
west
of
paraguay
used
to
plant
arrows
in
the
ground
about
a
sick
man
to
keep
death
from
getting
at
him
one
of
the
implements
of
a
haida
is
a
hollow
bone
in
which
he
bottles
up
departing
souls
and
so
restores
them
to
their
owners
when
any
one
yawns
in
their
presence
the
hindoos
always
snap
their
thumbs
believing
that
this
will
hinder
the
soul
from
issuing
through
the
open
mouth
the
marquesans
used
to
hold
the
mouth
and
nose
of
a
dying
man
in
order
to
keep
him
in
life
by
preventing
his
soul
from
escaping
the
same
custom
is
reported
of
the
new
caledonians
and
with
the
like
intention
the
bagobos
of
the
philippine
islands
put
rings
of
brass
wire
on
the
wrists
or
ankles
of
their
sick
on
the
other
hand
the
itonamas
in
south
america
seal
up
the
eyes
nose
and
mouth
of
a
dying
person
in
case
his
ghost
should
get
out
and
carry
off
others
and
for
a
similar
reason
the
people
of
nias
who
fear
the
spirits
of
the
recently
deceased
and
identify
them
with
the
breath
seek
to
confine
the
vagrant
soul
in
its
earthly
tabernacle
by
bunging
up
the
nose
or
tying
up
the
jaws
of
the
corpse
before
leaving
a
corpse
the
wakelbura
in
australia
used
to
place
hot
coals
in
its
ears
in
order
to
keep
the
ghost
in
the
body
until
they
had
got
such
a
good
start
that
he
could
not
overtake
them
esquimaux
mourners
plug
their
nostrils
with
deerskin
hair
or
hay
for
several
days
probably
to
prevent
their
souls
from
following
that
of
their
departed
friend
the
custom
is
especially
incumbent
on
the
persons
who
dress
the
corpse
in
southern
celebes
to
hinder
the
escape
of
a
woman
s
soul
at
childbirth
the
nurse
ties
a
band
as
tightly
as
possible
round
the
body
of
the
expectant
mother
the
minangkabauers
of
sumatra
observe
a
similar
custom
a
skein
of
thread
or
a
string
is
sometimes
fastened
round
the
wrist
or
loins
of
a
woman
in
childbed
so
that
when
her
soul
seeks
to
depart
in
her
hour
of
travail
it
may
find
the
egress
barred
among
the
kayans
of
borneo
illness
is
attributed
to
the
absence
of
the
soul
so
when
a
man
has
been
ill
and
is
well
again
he
attempts
to
prevent
his
soul
from
departing
afresh
for
this
purpose
he
ties
the
truant
into
his
body
by
fastening
round
his
wrist
a
piece
of
string
on
which
a
or
antique
bead
is
threaded
for
a
magical
virtue
appears
to
be
ascribed
to
such
beads
but
lest
the
string
and
the
bead
should
be
broken
and
lost
he
will
sometimes
tattoo
the
pattern
of
the
bead
on
his
wrist
and
this
is
found
to
answer
the
purpose
of
tethering
his
soul
quite
as
well
again
the
koryak
of
asia
fancy
that
if
there
are
two
sick
people
in
a
house
and
one
of
them
is
at
the
last
extremity
the
soul
of
the
other
is
apt
to
be
lured
away
by
the
soul
of
the
dying
man
hence
in
order
to
hinder
its
departure
they
tie
the
patient
s
neck
by
a
string
to
the
bands
of
the
and
recite
a
charm
over
the
string
so
that
it
may
be
sure
to
detain
the
soul
and
lest
the
soul
of
a
babe
should
escape
and
be
lost
as
soon
as
it
is
born
the
alfoors
of
celebes
when
a
birth
is
about
to
take
place
are
careful
to
close
every
opening
in
the
house
even
the
keyhole
and
they
stop
up
every
chink
and
cranny
in
the
walls
also
they
tie
up
the
mouths
of
all
animals
inside
and
outside
the
house
for
fear
one
of
them
might
swallow
the
child
s
soul
for
a
similar
reason
all
persons
present
in
the
house
even
the
mother
herself
are
obliged
to
keep
their
mouths
shut
the
whole
time
the
birth
is
taking
place
when
the
question
was
put
why
they
did
not
hold
their
noses
also
lest
the
child
s
soul
should
get
into
one
of
them
the
answer
was
that
breath
being
exhaled
as
well
as
inhaled
through
the
nostrils
the
soul
would
be
expelled
before
it
could
have
time
to
settle
down
popular
expressions
in
the
language
of
civilised
peoples
such
as
to
have
one
s
heart
in
one
s
mouth
or
the
soul
on
the
lips
or
in
the
nose
shew
how
natural
is
the
idea
that
the
life
or
soul
may
escape
by
the
mouth
or
nostrils
often
the
soul
is
conceived
as
a
bird
ready
to
take
flight
this
conception
has
probably
left
traces
in
most
languages
and
it
lingers
as
a
metaphor
in
poetry
but
what
is
metaphor
to
a
modern
european
poet
was
sober
earnest
to
his
savage
ancestor
and
is
still
so
to
many
people
the
bororos
of
brazil
fancy
that
the
human
soul
has
the
shape
of
a
bird
and
passes
in
that
shape
out
of
the
body
in
dreams
according
to
the
bilqula
or
bella
coola
indians
of
british
columbia
the
soul
dwells
in
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
resembles
a
bird
enclosed
in
an
egg
if
the
shell
breaks
and
the
soul
flies
away
the
man
must
die
if
he
swoons
or
becomes
crazed
it
is
because
his
soul
has
flown
away
without
breaking
its
shell
the
shaman
can
hear
the
buzzing
of
its
wings
like
the
buzz
of
a
mosquito
as
the
soul
flits
past
and
he
may
catch
and
replace
it
in
the
nape
of
its
owner
s
neck
a
melanesian
wizard
in
lepers
island
has
been
known
to
send
out
his
soul
in
the
form
of
an
eagle
to
pursue
a
ship
and
learn
the
fortunes
of
some
natives
who
were
being
carried
off
in
it
the
soul
of
aristeas
of
proconnesus
was
seen
to
issue
from
his
mouth
in
the
shape
of
a
raven
there
is
a
popular
opinion
in
bohemia
that
the
parting
soul
comes
forth
from
the
mouth
like
a
white
bird
the
malays
carry
out
the
conception
of
the
in
a
number
of
odd
ways
if
the
soul
is
a
bird
on
the
wing
it
may
be
attracted
by
rice
and
so
either
prevented
from
taking
wing
or
lured
back
again
from
its
perilous
flight
thus
in
java
when
a
child
is
placed
on
the
ground
for
the
first
time
a
moment
which
uncultured
people
seem
to
regard
as
especially
dangerous
it
is
put
in
a
and
the
mother
makes
a
clucking
sound
as
if
she
were
calling
hens
amongst
the
battas
of
sumatra
when
a
man
returns
from
a
dangerous
enterprise
grains
of
rice
are
placed
on
his
head
and
these
grains
are
called
that
is
means
to
make
the
soul
stay
at
in
java
also
rice
is
placed
on
the
head
of
persons
who
have
escaped
a
great
danger
or
have
returned
home
unexpectedly
after
it
had
been
supposed
that
they
were
lost
similarly
in
the
district
of
sintang
in
west
borneo
if
any
one
has
had
a
great
fright
or
escaped
a
serious
peril
or
comes
back
after
a
long
and
dangerous
journey
or
has
taken
a
solemn
oath
the
first
thing
that
his
relations
or
friends
do
is
to
strew
yellow
rice
on
his
head
mumbling
cluck
cluck
soul
koer
and
when
a
person
whether
man
woman
or
child
has
fallen
out
of
a
house
or
off
a
tree
and
has
been
brought
home
his
wife
or
other
kinswoman
goes
as
speedily
as
possible
to
the
spot
where
the
accident
happened
and
there
strews
rice
which
has
been
coloured
yellow
while
she
utters
the
words
cluck
cluck
soul
is
in
his
house
again
cluck
cluck
soul
then
she
gathers
up
the
rice
in
a
basket
carries
it
to
the
sufferer
and
drops
the
grains
from
her
hand
on
his
head
saying
again
cluck
cluck
soul
here
the
intention
clearly
is
to
decoy
back
the
loitering
and
replace
it
in
the
head
of
its
owner
in
southern
celebes
they
think
that
a
bridegroom
s
soul
is
apt
to
fly
away
at
marriage
so
coloured
rice
is
scattered
over
him
to
induce
it
to
stay
and
in
general
at
festivals
in
south
celebes
rice
is
strewed
on
the
head
of
the
person
in
whose
honour
the
festival
is
held
with
the
object
of
detaining
his
soul
which
at
such
times
is
in
especial
danger
of
being
lured
away
by
envious
demons
for
example
after
a
successful
war
the
welcome
to
the
victorious
prince
takes
the
form
of
strewing
him
with
roasted
and
coloured
rice
to
prevent
his
as
if
it
were
a
bird
from
flying
out
of
his
body
in
consequence
of
the
envy
of
evil
in
central
celebes
when
a
party
of
returns
from
a
successful
expedition
a
woman
scatters
rice
on
their
heads
for
a
similar
purpose
among
the
minangkabauers
of
sumatra
the
old
rude
notions
of
the
soul
seem
to
be
dying
out
nowadays
most
of
the
people
hold
that
the
soul
being
immaterial
has
no
shape
or
form
but
some
of
the
sorcerers
assert
that
the
soul
goes
and
comes
in
the
shape
of
a
tiny
man
others
are
of
opinion
that
it
does
so
in
the
form
of
a
fly
hence
they
make
food
ready
to
induce
the
absent
soul
to
come
back
and
the
first
fly
that
settles
on
the
food
is
regarded
as
the
returning
truant
but
in
native
poetry
and
popular
expressions
there
are
traces
of
the
belief
that
the
soul
quits
the
body
in
the
form
of
a
bird
the
soul
of
a
sleeper
is
supposed
to
wander
away
from
his
body
and
actually
to
visit
the
places
to
see
the
persons
and
to
perform
the
acts
of
which
he
dreams
for
example
when
an
indian
of
brazil
or
guiana
wakes
up
from
a
sound
sleep
he
is
firmly
convinced
that
his
soul
has
really
been
away
hunting
fishing
felling
trees
or
whatever
else
he
has
dreamed
of
doing
while
all
the
time
his
body
has
been
lying
motionless
in
his
hammock
a
whole
bororo
village
has
been
thrown
into
a
panic
and
nearly
deserted
because
somebody
had
dreamed
that
he
saw
enemies
stealthily
approaching
it
a
macusi
indian
in
weak
health
who
dreamed
that
his
employer
had
made
him
haul
the
canoe
up
a
series
of
difficult
cataracts
bitterly
reproached
his
master
next
morning
for
his
want
of
consideration
in
thus
making
a
poor
invalid
go
out
and
toil
during
the
night
the
indians
of
the
gran
chaco
are
often
heard
to
relate
the
most
incredible
stories
as
things
which
they
have
themselves
seen
and
heard
hence
strangers
who
do
not
know
them
intimately
say
in
their
haste
that
these
indians
are
liars
in
point
of
fact
the
indians
are
firmly
convinced
of
the
truth
of
what
they
relate
for
these
wonderful
adventures
are
simply
their
dreams
which
they
do
not
distinguish
from
waking
realities
now
the
absence
of
the
soul
in
sleep
has
its
dangers
for
if
from
any
cause
the
soul
should
be
permanently
detained
away
from
the
body
the
person
thus
deprived
of
the
vital
principle
must
die
there
is
a
german
belief
that
the
soul
escapes
from
a
sleeper
s
mouth
in
the
form
of
a
white
mouse
or
a
little
bird
and
that
to
prevent
the
return
of
the
bird
or
animal
would
be
fatal
to
the
sleeper
hence
in
transylvania
they
say
that
you
should
not
let
a
child
sleep
with
its
mouth
open
or
its
soul
will
slip
out
in
the
shape
of
a
mouse
and
the
child
will
never
wake
many
causes
may
detain
the
sleeper
s
soul
thus
his
soul
may
meet
the
soul
of
another
sleeper
and
the
two
souls
may
fight
if
a
guinea
negro
wakens
with
sore
bones
in
the
morning
he
thinks
that
his
soul
has
been
thrashed
by
another
soul
in
sleep
or
it
may
meet
the
soul
of
a
person
just
deceased
and
be
carried
off
by
it
hence
in
the
aru
islands
the
inmates
of
a
house
will
not
sleep
the
night
after
a
death
has
taken
place
in
it
because
the
soul
of
the
deceased
is
supposed
to
be
still
in
the
house
and
they
fear
to
meet
it
in
a
dream
similarly
among
the
upper
thompson
indians
of
british
columbia
the
friends
and
neighbours
who
gathered
in
a
house
after
a
death
and
remained
there
till
the
burial
was

allowed
to
sleep
lest
their
souls
should
be
drawn
away
by
the
ghost
of
the
deceased
or
by
his
guardian
spirit
the
lengua
indians
of
the
gran
chaco
hold
that
the
vagrant
spirits
of
the
dead
may
come
to
life
again
if
only
they
can
take
possession
of
a
sleeper
s
body
during
the
absence
of
his
soul
in
dreams
hence
when
the
shades
of
night
have
fallen
the
ghosts
of
the
departed
gather
round
the
villages
watching
for
a
chance
to
pounce
on
the
bodies
of
dreamers
and
to
enter
into
them
through
the
gateway
of
the
breast
again
the
soul
of
the
sleeper
may
be
prevented
by
an
accident
or
by
physical
force
from
returning
to
his
body
when
a
dyak
dreams
of
falling
into
the
water
he
supposes
that
this
accident
has
really
befallen
his
spirit
and
he
sends
for
a
wizard
who
fishes
for
the
spirit
with
a
in
a
basin
of
water
till
he
catches
it
and
restores
it
to
its
owner
the
santals
tell
how
a
man
fell
asleep
and
growing
very
thirsty
his
soul
in
the
form
of
a
lizard
left
his
body
and
entered
a
pitcher
of
water
to
drink
just
then
the
owner
of
the
pitcher
happened
to
cover
it
so
the
soul
could
not
return
to
the
body
and
the
man
died
while
his
friends
were
preparing
to
burn
the
body
some
one
uncovered
the
pitcher
to
get
water
the
lizard
thus
escaped
and
returned
to
the
body
which
immediately
revived
so
the
man
rose
up
and
asked
his
friends
why
they
were
weeping
they
told
him
they
thought
he
was
dead
and
were
about
to
burn
his
body
he
said
he
had
been
down
a
well
to
get
water
but
had
found
it
hard
to
get
out
and
had
just
returned
so
they
saw
it
all
a
similar
story
is
reported
from
transylvania
as
follows
in
the
account
of
a
witch
s
trial
at
mühlbach
in
the
eighteenth
century
it
is
said
that
a
woman
had
engaged
two
men
to
work
in
her
vineyard
after
noon
they
all
lay
down
to
rest
as
usual
an
hour
later
the
men
got
up
and
tried
to
waken
the
woman
but
could
not
she
lay
motionless
with
her
mouth
wide
open
they
came
back
at
sunset
and
still
she
lay
like
a
corpse
just
at
that
moment
a
big
fly
came
buzzing
past
which
one
of
the
men
caught
and
shut
up
in
his
leathern
pouch
then
they
tried
again
to
waken
the
woman
but
could
not
afterwards
they
let
out
the
fly
it
flew
straight
into
the
woman
s
mouth
and
she
awoke
on
seeing
this
the
men
had
no
further
doubt
that
she
was
a
witch
it
is
a
common
rule
with
primitive
people
not
to
waken
a
sleeper
because
his
soul
is
away
and
might
not
have
time
to
get
back
so
if
the
man
wakened
without
his
soul
he
would
fall
sick
if
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
rouse
a
sleeper
it
must
be
done
very
gradually
to
allow
the
soul
time
to
return
a
fijian
in
matuku
suddenly
wakened
from
a
nap
by
somebody
treading
on
his
foot
has
been
heard
bawling
after
his
soul
and
imploring
it
to
return
he
had
just
been
dreaming
that
he
was
far
away
in
tonga
and
great
was
his
alarm
on
suddenly
wakening
to
find
his
body
in
matuku
death
stared
him
in
the
face
unless
his
soul
could
be
induced
to
speed
at
once
across
the
sea
and
reanimate
its
deserted
tenement
the
man
would
probably
have
died
of
fright
if
a
missionary
had
not
been
at
hand
to
allay
his
terror
some
brazilian
indians
explain
the
headache
from
which
a
man
sometimes
suffers
after
a
broken
sleep
by
saying
that
his
soul
is
tired
with
the
exertions
it
made
to
return
quickly
to
the
body
a
highland
story
told
to
hugh
miller
on
the
picturesque
shores
of
loch
shin
well
illustrates
the
haste
made
by
the
soul
to
regain
its
body
when
the
sleeper
has
been
prematurely
roused
by
an
indiscreet
friend
two
young
men
had
been
spending
the
early
part
of
a
warm
summer
day
in
the
open
air
and
sat
down
on
a
mossy
bank
to
rest
hard
by
was
an
ancient
ruin
separated
from
the
bank
on
which
they
sat
only
by
a
slender
runnel
across
which
there
lay
immediately
over
a
miniature
cascade
a
few
withered
stalks
of
grass
overcome
by
the
heat
of
the
day
one
of
the
young
men
fell
asleep
his
companion
watched
drowsily
beside
him
when
all
at
once
the
watcher
was
aroused
to
attention
by
seeing
a
little
indistinct
form
scarce
larger
than
a
issue
from
the
mouth
of
the
sleeping
man
and
leaping
upon
the
moss
move
downwards
to
the
runnel
which
it
crossed
along
the
withered
grass
stalks
and
then
disappeared
among
the
interstices
of
the
ruin
alarmed
by
what
he
saw
the
watcher
hastily
shook
his
companion
by
the
shoulder
and
awoke
him
though
with
all
his
haste
the
little
creature
still
more
rapid
in
its
movements
issued
from
the
interstice
into
which
it
had
gone
and
flying
across
the
runnel
instead
of
creeping
along
the
grass
stalks
and
over
the
sward
as
before
it
the
mouth
of
the
sleeper
just
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
awakening
what
is
the
matter
with
you
said
the
watcher
greatly
alarmed
what
ails
you
nothing
ails
me
replied
the
other
but
you
have
robbed
me
of
a
most
delightful
dream
i
dreamed
i
was
walking
through
a
fine
rich
country
and
came
at
length
to
the
shores
of
a
noble
river
and
just
where
the
clear
water
went
thundering
down
a
precipice
there
was
a
bridge
all
of
silver
which
i
crossed
and
then
entering
a
noble
palace
on
the
opposite
side
i
saw
great
heaps
of
gold
and
jewels
and
i
was
just
going
to
load
myself
with
treasure
when
you
rudely
awoke
me
and
i
lost
still
more
dangerous
is
it
in
the
opinion
of
primitive
man
to
move
a
sleeper
or
alter
his
appearance
for
if
this
were
done
the
soul
on
its
return
might
not
be
able
to
find
or
recognise
its
body
and
so
the
person
would
die
the
minangkabauers
of
sumatra
deem
it
highly
improper
to
blacken
or
dirty
the
face
of
a
sleeper
lest
the
absent
soul
should
shrink
from
a
body
thus
disfigured
patani
malays
fancy
that
if
a
person
s
face
be
painted
while
he
sleeps
the
soul
which
has
gone
out
of
him
will
not
recognise
him
and
he
will
sleep
on
till
his
face
is
washed
in
bombay
it
is
thought
equivalent
to
murder
to
change
the
aspect
of
a
sleeper
as
by
painting
his
face
in
fantastic
colours
or
giving
moustaches
to
a
sleeping
woman
for
when
the
soul
returns
it
will
not
know
its
own
body
and
the
person
will
die
the
coreans
are
of
opinion
that
in
sleep
the
soul
goes
out
of
the
body
and
that
if
a
piece
of
paper
is
put
over
the
face
of
the
sleeper
he
will
surely
die
for
his
soul
can
not
find
its
way
back
into
him
the
servians
believe
that
the
soul
of
a
sleeping
witch
often
leaves
her
body
in
the
form
of
a
butterfly
if
during
its
absence
her
body
be
turned
round
so
that
her
feet
are
placed
where
her
head
was
before
the
butterfly
soul
will
not
find
its
way
back
into
her
body
through
the
mouth
and
the
witch
will
die
the
esthonians
of
the
island
of
oesel
think
that
the
gusts
which
sweep
up
all
kinds
of
trifles
from
the
ground
and
whirl
them
along
are
the
souls
of
old
women
who
have
gone
out
in
this
shape
to
seek
what
they
can
find
meantime
the
beldame
s
body
lies
as
still
as
a
stone
and
if
you
turn
it
round
her
soul
will
never
be
able
to
enter
it
again
until
you
have
replaced
the
body
in
its
original
position
you
can
hear
the
soul
whining
and
whimpering
till
it
has
found
the
right
aperture
similarly
in
livonia
they
think
that
when
the
soul
of
a
is
out
on
his
hateful
business
his
body
lies
like
dead
and
if
meanwhile
the
body
were
accidentally
moved
the
soul
would
never
more
find
its
way
into
it
but
would
remain
in
the
body
of
a
wolf
till
death
in
the
picturesque
but
little
known
black
mountain
of
southern
france
which
forms
a
sort
of
link
between
the
pyrenees
and
the
cevennes
they
tell
how
a
woman
who
had
long
been
suspected
of
being
a
witch
one
day
fell
asleep
at
noon
among
the
reapers
in
the
field
resolved
to
put
her
to
the
test
the
reapers
carried
her
while
she
slept
to
another
part
of
the
field
leaving
a
large
pitcher
on
the
spot
from
which
they
had
moved
her
when
her
soul
returned
it
entered
the
pitcher
and
cunningly
rolled
it
over
and
over
till
the
vessel
lay
beside
her
body
of
which
the
soul
thereupon
took
possession
but
in
order
that
a
man
s
soul
should
quit
his
body
it
is
not
necessary
that
he
should
be
asleep
it
may
quit
him
in
his
waking
hours
and
then
sickness
insanity
or
death
will
be
the
result
thus
a
man
of
the
wurunjeri
tribe
in
victoria
lay
at
his
last
gasp
because
his
spirit
had
departed
from
him
a
went
in
pursuit
and
caught
the
spirit
by
the
middle
just
as
it
was
about
to
plunge
into
the
sunset
glow
which
is
the
light
cast
by
the
souls
of
the
dead
as
they
pass
in
and
out
of
the
underworld
where
the
sun
goes
to
rest
having
captured
the
vagrant
spirit
the
doctor
brought
it
back
under
his
opossum
rug
laid
himself
down
on
the
dying
man
and
put
the
soul
back
into
him
so
that
after
a
time
he
revived
the
karens
of
burma
are
perpetually
anxious
about
their
souls
lest
these
should
go
roving
from
their
bodies
leaving
the
owners
to
die
when
a
man
has
reason
to
fear
that
his
soul
is
about
to
take
this
fatal
step
a
ceremony
is
performed
to
retain
or
recall
it
in
which
the
whole
family
must
take
part
a
meal
is
prepared
consisting
of
a
cock
and
hen
a
special
kind
of
rice
and
a
bunch
of
bananas
then
the
head
of
the
family
takes
the
bowl
which
is
used
to
skim
rice
and
knocking
with
it
thrice
on
the
top
of
the
says
come
back
soul
do
not
tarry
outside
if
it
rains
you
will
be
wet
if
the
sun
shines
you
will
be
hot
the
gnats
will
sting
you
the
leeches
will
bite
you
the
tigers
will
devour
you
the
thunder
will
crush
you
come
back
soul
here
it
will
be
well
with
you
you
shall
want
for
nothing
come
and
eat
under
shelter
from
the
wind
and
the
after
that
the
family
partakes
of
the
meal
and
the
ceremony
ends
with
everybody
tying
their
right
wrist
with
a
string
which
has
been
charmed
by
a
sorcerer
similarly
the
lolos
an
aboriginal
tribe
of
western
china
believe
that
the
soul
leaves
the
body
in
chronic
illness
in
that
case
they
read
a
sort
of
elaborate
litany
calling
on
the
soul
by
name
and
beseeching
it
to
return
from
the
hills
the
vales
the
rivers
the
forests
the
fields
or
from
wherever
it
may
be
straying
at
the
same
time
cups
of
water
wine
and
rice
are
set
at
the
door
for
the
refreshment
of
the
weary
wandering
spirit
when
the
ceremony
is
over
they
tie
a
red
cord
round
the
arm
of
the
sick
man
to
tether
the
soul
and
this
cord
is
worn
by
him
until
it
decays
and
drops
off
so
among
the
kenyahs
of
sarawak
a
has
been
known
to
recall
the
stray
soul
of
a
child
and
to
fasten
it
firmly
in
its
body
by
tying
a
string
round
the
child
s
right
wrist
and
smearing
its
little
arm
with
the
blood
of
a
fowl
the
ilocanes
of
luzon
think
that
a
man
may
lose
his
soul
in
the
woods
or
gardens
and
that
he
who
has
thus
lost
his
soul
loses
also
his
senses
hence
before
they
quit
the
woods
or
the
fields
they
call
to
their
soul
let
us
go
let
us
go
lest
it
should
loiter
behind
or
go
astray
and
when
a
man
becomes
crazed
or
mad
they
take
him
to
the
place
where
he
is
supposed
to
have
lost
his
soul
and
invite
the
truant
spirit
to
return
to
his
body
the
mongols
sometimes
explain
sickness
by
supposing
that
the
patient
s
soul
is
absent
and
either
does
not
care
to
return
to
its
body
or
can
not
find
the
way
back
to
secure
the
return
of
the
soul
it
is
therefore
necessary
on
the
one
hand
to
make
its
body
as
attractive
as
possible
and
on
the
other
hand
to
shew
the
soul
the
way
home
to
make
the
body
attractive
all
the
sick
man
s
best
clothes
and
most
valued
possessions
are
placed
beside
him
he
is
washed
incensed
and
made
as
comfortable
as
may
be
and
all
his
friends
march
thrice
round
the
hut
calling
out
the
sick
man
s
name
and
coaxing
his
soul
to
return
to
help
the
wanderer
to
find
its
way
back
a
coloured
cord
is
stretched
from
the
patient
s
head
to
the
door
of
the
hut
the
priest
in
his
robes
reads
a
list
of
the
horrors
of
hell
and
the
dangers
incurred
by
souls
which
wilfully
absent
themselves
from
their
bodies
then
turning
to
the
assembled
friends
and
the
patient
he
asks
is
it
come
all
answer
yes
and
bowing
to
the
returning
soul
throw
seed
over
the
sick
man
the
cord
which
guided
the
soul
back
is
then
rolled
up
and
placed
round
the
patient
s
neck
who
must
wear
it
for
seven
days
without
taking
it
off
no
one
may
frighten
or
hurt
him
lest
his
soul
not
yet
familiar
with
its
body
should
again
take
flight
some
of
the
congo
tribes
believe
that
when
a
man
is
ill
his
soul
has
left
his
body
and
is
wandering
at
large
the
aid
of
the
sorcerer
is
then
called
in
to
capture
the
vagrant
spirit
and
restore
it
to
the
invalid
generally
the
physician
declares
that
he
has
successfully
chased
the
soul
into
the
branch
of
a
tree
the
whole
town
thereupon
turns
out
and
accompanies
the
doctor
to
the
tree
where
the
strongest
men
are
deputed
to
break
off
the
branch
in
which
the
soul
of
the
sick
man
is
supposed
to
be
lodged
this
they
do
and
carry
the
branch
back
to
the
town
insinuating
by
their
gestures
that
the
burden
is
heavy
and
hard
to
bear
when
the
branch
has
been
brought
to
the
sick
man
s
hut
he
is
placed
in
an
upright
position
by
its
side
and
the
sorcerer
performs
the
enchantments
by
which
the
soul
is
believed
to
be
restored
to
its
owner
the
soul
or
shade
of
a
déné
or
tinneh
indian
in
the
old
days
generally
remained
invisible
but
appeared
wandering
about
in
one
form
or
another
whenever
disease
or
death
was
imminent
all
the
efforts
of
the
sufferer
s
friends
were
therefore
concentrated
on
catching
the
roving
shade
the
method
adopted
was
simple
they
stuffed
the
patient
s
moccasins
with
down
and
hung
them
up
if
next
morning
the
down
was
warm
they
made
sure
that
the
lost
soul
was
in
the
boots
with
which
accordingly
they
carefully
and
silently
shod
their
suffering
friend
nothing
more
could
reasonably
be
demanded
for
a
perfect
cure
an
ottawa
has
been
known
to
catch
a
stray
soul
in
a
little
box
which
he
brought
back
and
inserted
in
the
patient
s
mouth
pining
sickness
great
fright
and
death
are
ascribed
by
the
battas
or
bataks
of
sumatra
to
the
absence
of
the
soul
from
the
body
at
first
they
try
to
beckon
the
wanderer
back

the

sometimes
the
means
adopted
by
the
battas
to
procure
the
return
of
a
sick
person

are
more
elaborate
a
procession
sets
out
from
the
village
to
the
tuck
of
drum
to
find
and
bring
home
the
strayed
soul
first
goes
a
person
bearing
a
basket
which
contains
cakes
of
rice
dyed
yellow
and
a
boiled
fowl
s
egg
the
sorcerer
follows
carrying
a
chicken
and
behind
him
walks
a
man
with
a
black
red
and
white
flag
a
crowd
of
sympathisers
brings
up
the
rear
on
reaching
the
spot
where
the
lost
soul
is
supposed
to
tarry
they
set
up
a
small
bamboo
altar
and
the
sorcerer
offers
on
it
the
chicken
to
the
spirit
of
the
place
the
drums
beating
all
the
time
then
waving
his
shawl
to
attract
the
soul
of
the
sick
man
he
says
come
hither
thou
soul
of
whether
thou
sittest
among
the
stones
or
in
the
mud
in
the
house
is
thy
place
we
have
besought
the
spirit
to
let
thee
after
that
the
procession
reforms
and
marches
back
to
the
village
to
the
roll
of
drums
and
the
clash
of
cymbals
on
reaching
the
door
of
the
house
the
sorcerer
calls
out
to
the
inmates
has
it
come
and
a
voice
from
within
answers
it
is
here
good
at
evening
the
drums
beat
again
a
number
of
plants
including
rice
a
species
of
fig
and
garlic
are
supposed
by
the
battas
to
possess
virtue
and
are
accordingly
made
use
of
by
them
in
rites
for
the
recovery
of
lost
souls
when
a
child
is
sick
the
mother
commonly
waves
a
cloth
to
beckon
home
its
wandering
spirit
and
when
a
cock
crows
or
a
hen
cackles
in
the
yard
she
knows
that
the
prodigal
has
returned
if
the
little
sufferer
persists
in
being
ill
in
spite
of
these
favourable
omens
the
mother
will
hang
a
bag
of
rice
at
the
head
of
her
bed
when
she
goes
to
sleep
and
next
morning
on
getting
up
she
measures
the
rice
if
the
rice
has
increased
in
volume
during
the
night
as
it
may
do
in
a
atmosphere
she
is
confident
that
the
lost
soul
has
indeed
come
home
to
stay
the
kayans
of
borneo
fasten
packets
of
rice
flesh
and
fish
to
the
window
in
the
roof
through
which
the
wandering
soul
of
a
sick
man
is
expected
to
return
home
the
doctor
sits
on
a
mat
under
the
open
window
with
a
display
of
pretty
things
spread
out
temptingly
before
him
as
baits
to
entice
the
spirit
back
to
its
deserted
tabernacle
from
the
window
hangs
a
string
of
precious
corals
or
pearls
to
serve
the
returning
prodigal
as
a
ladder
and
so
facilitate
his
descent
into
the
house
the
lower
end
of
the
string
is
attached
to
a
bundle
composed
of
wooden
hooks
a
fowl
s
feather
little
packets
of
rice
and
so
forth
chanting
his
spells
the
doctor
strokes
the
soul
down
the
string
into
the
bundle
which
he
then
deposits
in
a
basket
and
hides
in
a
corner
till
the
dusk
of
the
evening
when
darkness
has
fallen
he
blows
the
captured
soul
back
into
the
patient
s
head
and
strokes
the
sufferer
s
arm
downwards
with
the
point
of
an
old
spear
in
order
to
settle
the
soul
firmly
in
his
body
once
when
a
popular
traveller
was
leaving
a
kayan
village
the
mothers
fearing
that
their
children
s
souls
might
follow
him
on
his
journey
brought
him
the
boards
on
which
they
carry
their
infants
and
begged
him
to
pray
that
the
souls
of
the
little
ones
would
return
to
the
familiar
boards
and
not
go
away
with
him
into
the
far
country
to
each
board
was
fastened
a
looped
string
for
the
purpose
of
tethering
the
vagrant
spirits
and
through
the
loop
each
baby
was
made
to
pass
a
chubby
finger
to
make
sure
that
its
tiny
soul
would
not
wander
away
when
a
dyak
is
dangerously
ill
the
may
say
that
his
soul
has
escaped
far
away
perhaps
to
the
river
then
they
will
wave
a
garment
or
cloth
about
to
imitate
the
casting
of
a
net
signifying
thereby
that
they
are
catching
the
soul
like
a
fish
in
a
net
or
they
may
give
out
that
the
soul
has
escaped
into
the
jungle
and
then
they
will
rush
out
of
the
house
to
circumvent
and
secure
it
there
or
again
they
may
allege
that
it
has
been
carried
away
over
seas
to
some
unknown
land
and
then
they
will
play
at
paddling
a
boat
to
follow
it
across
the
great
water
but
more
commonly
their
mode
of
treatment
is
as
follows
a
spear
is
set
up
in
the
middle
of
the
verandah
with
a
few
leaves
tied
to
it
and
the
of
the
laid
at
its
foot
round
this
the
doctors
run
at
full
speed
chanting
the
while
till
one
of
them
falls
down
and
lies
motionless
the
bystanders
cover
him
with
a
blanket
and
wait
while
his
spirit
hies
away
after
the
errant
soul
and
brings
it
back
presently
he
comes
to
himself
stares
vacantly
about
like
a
man
awaking
from
sleep
and
then
rises
holding
the
soul
in
his
clenched
right
hand
he
then
returns
it
to
the
patient
through
the
crown
of
his
head
while
he
mutters
a
spell
among
the
dyaks
of
the
kayan
and
lower
melawie
districts
you
will
often
see
in
houses
where
there
are
children
a
basket
of
a
peculiar
shape
with
shells
and
dried
fruits
attached
to
it
these
shells
contain
the
remains
of
the
children
s
and
the
basket
to
which
they
are
fastened
is
commonly
hung
beside
the
place
where
the
children
sleep
when
a
child
is
frightened
for
example
by
being
bathed
or
by
the
bursting
of
a
thunderstorm
its
soul
flees
from
its
body
and
nestles
beside
its
old
familiar
friend
the
in
the
basket
from
which
the
mother
easily
induces
it
to
return
by
shaking
the
basket
and
pressing
it
to
the
child
s
body
the
toboongkoos
of
central
celebes
believe
that
sickness
in
general
is
caused
by
the
departure
of
the
soul
to
recover
the
wanderer
a
priest
will
set
out
food
in
the
courtyard
of
the
sufferer
s
house
and
then
invoke
the
soul
promising
it
many
fine
things
if
it
will
only
come
back
when
he
thinks
it
has
complied
with
his
request
he
catches
it
in
a
cloth
which
he
keeps
ready
for
the
purpose
this
cloth
he
afterwards
claps
on
the
sick
man
s
head
thereby
restoring
to
him
his
lost
soul
in
an
indian
story
a
king
conveys
his
soul
into
the
dead
body
of
a
brahman
and
a
hunchback
conveys
his
soul
into
the
deserted
body
of
the
king
the
hunchback
is
now
king
and
the
king
is
a
brahman
however
the
hunchback
is
induced
to
shew
his
skill
by
transferring
his
soul
to
the
dead
body
of
a
parrot
and
the
king
seizes
the
opportunity
to
regain
possession
of
his
own
body
a
tale
of
the
same
type
with
variations
of
detail
reappears
among
the
malays
a
king
has
incautiously
transferred
his
soul
to
an
ape
upon
which
the
vizier
adroitly
inserts
his
own
soul
into
the
king
s
body
and
so
takes
possession
of
the
queen
and
the
kingdom
while
the
true
king
languishes
at
court
in
the
outward
semblance
of
an
ape
but
one
day
the
false
king
who
played
for
high
stakes
was
watching
a
combat
of
rams
and
it
happened
that
the
animal
on
which
he
had
laid
his
money
fell
down
dead
all
efforts
to
restore
animation
proved
unavailing
till
the
false
king
with
the
instinct
of
a
true
sportsman
transferred
his
own
soul
to
the
body
of
the
deceased
ram
and
thus
renewed
the
fray
the
real
king
in
the
body
of
the
ape
saw
his
chance
and
with
great
presence
of
mind
darted
back
into
his
own
body
which
the
vizier
had
rashly
vacated
so
he
came
to
his
own
again
and
the
usurper
in
the
ram
s
body
met
with
the
fate
he
richly
deserved
in
another
indian
story
a
brahman
reanimates
the
dead
body
of
a
king
by
conveying
his
own
soul
into
it
meantime
the
brahman
s
body
has
been
burnt
and
his
soul
is
obliged
to
remain
in
the
body
of
the
king
in
a
chinese
story
we
read
of
a
monk
in
a
buddhist
monastery
who
used
from
time
to
time
to
send
his
soul
away
out
of
himself
whenever
he
was
thus
absent
from
the
body
he
took
the
precaution
of
locking
the
door
of
his
cell
on
one
of
these
occasions
an
envoy
from
the
north
arrived
and
put
up
at
the
monastery
but
there
was
no
cell
for
him
to
pass
the
night
in
then
he
looked
into
the
cell
of
the
brother
whose
soul
was
not
at
home
and
seeing
his
body
lying
there
motionless
he
battered
the
door
in
and
said
i
will
lodge
here
the
man
is
dead
take
the
body
and
burn
his
servants
obeyed
his
orders
the
monks
being
powerless
to
interfere
that
very
night
the
soul
came
back
only
to
find
its
body
reduced
to
ashes
every
night
it
could
be
heard
crying
where
shall
i
settle
those
who
knew
him
then
opened
their
windows
saying
here
i
so
the
soul
came
in
and
united
itself
with
their
body
and
the
result
was
that
they
became
much
cleverer
than
before
similarly
the
greeks
told
how
the
soul
of
hermotimus
of
clazomenae
used
to
quit
his
body
and
roam
far
and
wide
bringing
back
intelligence
of
what
he
had
seen
on
his
rambles
to
his
friends
at
home
until
one
day
when
his
spirit
was
abroad
his
enemies
contrived
to
seize
his
deserted
body
and
committed
it
to
the
flames
it
is
said
that
during
the
last
seven
years
of
his
life
sultan
bayazid
ate
nothing
that
had
life
and
blood
in
it
one
day
being
seized
with
a
great
longing
for
sheep
s
trotters
he
struggled
long
in
this
glorious
contest
with
his
soul
until
at
last
a
savoury
dish
of
trotters
being
set
before
him
he
said
unto
his
soul
my
soul
the
trotters
are
before
thee
if
thou
wishest
to
enjoy
them
leave
the
body
and
feed
on
hardly
had
he
uttered
these
words
when
a
living
creature
was
seen
to
issue
from
his
mouth
and
drink
of
the
juice
in
the
dish
after
which
it
endeavoured
to
return
whence
it
came
but
the
austere
sultan
determined
to
mortify
his
carnal
appetite
prevented
it
with
his
hand
from
entering
his
mouth
and
when
it
fell
to
the
ground
commanded
that
it
should
be
beaten
the
pages
kicked
it
to
death
and
after
this
murder
of
his
soul
the
sultan
remained
in
gloomy
seclusion
taking
no
part
or
interest
in
the
affairs
of
government
the
departure
of
the
soul
is
not
always
voluntary
it
may
be
extracted
from
the
body
against
its
will
by
ghosts
demons
or
sorcerers
hence
when
a
funeral
is
passing
the
house
the
karens
of
burma
tie
their
children
with
a
special
kind
of
string
to
a
particular
part
of
the
house
lest
the
souls
of
the
children
should
leave
their
bodies
and
go
into
the
corpse
which
is
passing
the
children
are
kept
tied
in
this
way
until
the
corpse
is
out
of
sight
and
after
the
corpse
has
been
laid
in
the
grave
but
before
the
earth
has
been
shovelled
in
the
mourners
and
friends
range
themselves
round
the
grave
each
with
a
bamboo
split
lengthwise
in
one
hand
and
a
little
stick
in
the
other
each
man
thrusts
his
bamboo
into
the
grave
and
drawing
the
stick
along
the
groove
of
the
bamboo
points
out
to
his
soul
that
in
this
way
it
may
easily
climb
up
out
of
the
tomb
while
the
earth
is
being
shovelled
in
the
bamboos
are
kept
out
of
the
way
lest
the
souls
should
be
in
them
and
so
should
be
inadvertently
buried
with
the
earth
as
it
is
being
thrown
into
the
grave
and
when
the
people
leave
the
spot
they
carry
away
the
bamboos
begging
their
souls
to
come
with
them
further
on
returning
from
the
grave
each
karen
provides
himself
with
three
little
hooks
made
of
branches
of
trees
and
calling
his
spirit
to
follow
him
at
short
intervals
as
he
returns
he
makes
a
motion
as
if
hooking
it
and
then
thrusts
the
hook
into
the
ground
this
is
done
to
prevent
the
soul
of
the
living
from
staying
behind
with
the
soul
of
the
dead
on
the
return
of
a
burmese
or
shan
family
from
a
burial
old
men
tie
up
the
wrists
of
each
member
of
the
family
with
string
to
prevent
his
or
her
butterfly
or
soul
from
escaping
and
this
string
remains
till
it
is
worn
out
and
falls
off
when
a
mother
dies
leaving
a
young
baby
the
burmese
think
that
the
butterfly
or
soul
of
the
baby
follows
that
of
the
mother
and
that
if
it
is
not
recovered
the
child
must
die
so
a
wise
woman
is
called
in
to
get
back
the
baby
s
soul
she
places
a
mirror
near
the
corpse
and
on
the
mirror
a
piece
of
feathery
cotton
down
holding
a
cloth
in
her
open
hands
at
the
foot
of
the
mirror
she
with
wild
words
entreats
the
mother
not
to
take
with
her
the
butterfly
or
soul
of
her
child
but
to
send
it
back
as
the
gossamer
down
slips
from
the
face
of
the
mirror
she
catches
it
in
the
cloth
and
tenderly
places
it
on
the
baby
s
breast
the
same
ceremony
is
sometimes
observed
when
one
of
two
children
that
have
played
together
dies
and
is
thought
to
be
luring
away
the
soul
of
its
playmate
to
the
it
is
sometimes
performed
also
for
a
bereaved
husband
or
wife
the
bahnars
of
eastern
think
that
when
a
man
is
sick
of
a
fever
his
soul
has
gone
away
with
the
ghosts
to
the
tombs
at
sunset
a
sorcerer
attempts
to
lure
the
soul
back
by
offering
it
bananas
and
other
fruits
while
he
sings
an
incantation
inviting
the
wanderer
to
return
from
among
the
dead
to
the
land
of
the
living
he
pretends
to
catch
the
truant
soul
in
a
piece
of
cotton
which
he
then
lays
on
the
patient
s
head
when
the
of
sumatra
have
buried
somebody
and
are
filling
in
the
grave
a
sorceress
runs
about
beating
the
air
with
a
stick
this
she
does
in
order
to
drive
away
the
souls
of
the
survivors
for
if
one
of
these
souls
happened
to
slip
into
the
grave
and
to
be
covered
up
with
earth
its
owner
would
die
among
some
of
the
dyak
tribes
of
borneo
as
soon
as
the
coffin
is
carried
to
the
place
of
burial
the
house
in
which
the
death
occurred
is
sprinkled
with
water
and
the
father
of
the
family
calls
out
the
names
of
all
his
children
and
the
other
members
of
his
household
for
they
think
that
the
ghost
loves
to
decoy
away
the
souls
of
his
kinsfolk
but
that
his
designs
upon
them
can
be
defeated
by
calling
out
their
names
which
has
the
effect
of
bringing
back
the
souls
to
their
owners
the
same
ceremony
is
repeated
on
the
return
from
the
burial
it
is
a
rule
with
the
kwakiutl
indians
of
british
columbia
that
a
corpse
must
not
be
coffined
in
the
house
or
the
souls
of
the
other
inmates
would
enter
the
coffin
and
they
too
would
die
the
body
is
taken
out
either
through
the
roof
or
through
a
hole
made
in
one
of
the
walls
and
is
then
coffined
outside
the
house
in
the
east
indian
island
of
keisar
it
is
deemed
imprudent
to
go
near
a
grave
at
night
lest
the
ghosts
should
catch
and
keep
the
soul
of
the
the
kei
islanders
believe
that
the
spirits
of
their
forefathers
angry
at
not
receiving
food
make
people
sick
by
detaining
their
souls
so
they
lay
offerings
of
food
on
the
grave
and
beg
their
ancestors
to
allow
the
soul
of
the
sick
to
return
or
to
drive
it
home
speedily
if
it
should
be
lingering
by
the
way
in
bolang
mongondo
a
district
in
the
west
of
celebes
all
sickness
is
ascribed
to
the
ancestral
spirits
who
have
carried
off
the
patient
s
soul
the
object
therefore
is
to
bring
back
the
soul
of
the
sufferer
and
restore
it
to
him
an
has
thus
described
the
attempted
cure
of
a
sick
boy
the
priestesses
who
acted
as
physicians
made
a
doll
of
cloth
and
fastened
it
to
the
point
of
a
spear
which
an
old
woman
held
upright
round
this
doll
the
priestesses
danced
uttering
charms
and
chirruping
as
when
one
calls
a
dog
then
the
old
woman
lowered
the
point
of
the
spear
a
little
so
that
the
priestesses
could
reach
the
doll
by
this
time
the
soul
of
the
sick
boy
was
supposed
to
be
in
the
doll
having
been
brought
into
it
by
the
incantations
so
the
priestesses
approached
it
cautiously
on
tiptoe
and
caught
the
soul
in
the
cloths
which
they
had
been
waving
in
the
air
then
they
laid
the
soul
on
the
boy
s
head
that
is
they
wrapped
his
head
in
the
cloth
in
which
the
soul
was
supposed
to
be
and
stood
still
for
some
moments
with
great
gravity
holding
their
hands
on
the
patient
s
head
suddenly
there
was
a
jerk
the
priestesses
whispered
and
shook
their
heads
and
the
cloth
was
taken
soul
had
escaped
the
priestesses
gave
chase
to
it
running
round
and
round
the
house
clucking
and
gesticulating
as
if
they
were
driving
hens
into
a
at
last
they
recaptured
the
soul
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
and
restored
it
to
its
owner
as
before
much
in
the
same
way
an
australian
will
sometimes
bring
the
lost
soul
of
a
sick
man
into
a
puppet
and
restore
it
to
the
patient
by
pressing
the
puppet
to
his
breast
in
uea
one
of
the
loyalty
islands
the
souls
of
the
dead
seem
to
have
been
credited
with
the
power
of
stealing
the
souls
of
the
living
for
when
a
man
was
sick
the
would
go
with
a
large
troop
of
men
and
women
to
the
graveyard
here
the
men
played
on
flutes
and
the
women
whistled
softly
to
lure
the
soul
home
after
this
had
gone
on
for
some
time
they
formed
in
procession
and
moved
homewards
the
flutes
playing
and
the
women
whistling
all
the
way
while
they
led
back
the
wandering
soul
and
drove
it
gently
along
with
open
palms
on
entering
the
patient
s
dwelling
they
commanded
the
soul
in
a
loud
voice
to
enter
his
body
in
madagascar
when
a
man
was
sick
or
lunatic
in
consequence
of
the
loss
of
his
soul
his
friends
despatched
a
wizard
in
haste
to
fetch
him
a
soul
from
the
graveyard
the
emissary
repaired
by
night
to
the
spot
and
having
made
a
hole
in
the
wooden
house
which
served
as
a
tomb
begged
the
spirit
of
the
patient
s
father
to
bestow
a
soul
on
his
son
or
daughter
who
had
none
so
saying
he
applied
a
bonnet
to
the
hole
then
folded
it
up
and
rushed
back
to
the
house
of
the
sufferer
saying
he
had
a
soul
for
him
with
that
he
clapped
the
bonnet
on
the
head
of
the
invalid
who
at
once
said
he
felt
much
better
and
had
recovered
the
soul
which
he
had
lost
when
a
dyak
or
malay
of
some
of
the
western
tribes
or
districts
of
borneo
is
taken
ill
with
vomiting
and
profuse
sweating
as
the
only
symptoms
he
thinks
that
one
of
his
deceased
kinsfolk
or
ancestors
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
to
discover
which
of
them
is
the
culprit
a
wise
man
or
woman
pulls
a
lock
of
hair
on
the
crown
of
the
sufferer
s
head
calling
out
the
names
of
all
his
dead
relations
the
name
at
which
the
lock
gives
forth
a
sound
is
the
name
of
the
guilty
party
if
the
patient
s
hair
is
too
short
to
be
tugged
with
effect
he
knocks
his
forehead
seven
times
against
the
forehead
of
a
kinsman
who
has
long
hair
the
hair
of
the
latter
is
then
tugged
instead
of
that
of
the
patient
and
answers
to
the
test
quite
as
well
when
the
blame
has
thus
been
satisfactorily
laid
at
the
door
of
the
ghost
who
is
responsible
for
the
sickness
the
physician
who
as
in
other
countries
is
often
an
old
woman
remonstrates
with
him
on
his
ill
behaviour
go
back
says
she
to
your
grave
what
do
you
come
here
for
the
soul
of
the
sick
man
does
not
choose
to
be
called
by
you
and
will
remain
yet
a
long
time
in
its
then
she
puts
some
ashes
from
the
hearth
in
a
winnowing
fan
and
moulds
out
of
them
a
small
figure
or
image
in
human
likeness
seven
times
she
moves
the
basket
with
the
little
ashen
figure
up
and
down
before
the
patient
taking
care
not
to
obliterate
the
figure
while
at
the
same
time
she
says
sickness
settle
in
the
head
belly
hands
etc
then
quickly
pass
into
the
corresponding
part
of
the
image
whereupon
the
patient
spits
on
the
ashen
image
and
pushes
it
from
him
with
his
left
hand
next
the
beldame
lights
a
candle
and
goes
to
the
grave
of
the
person
whose
ghost
is
doing
all
the
mischief
on
the
grave
she
throws
the
figure
of
ashes
calling
out
ghost
plague
the
sick
man
no
longer
and
stay
in
your
grave
that
he
may
see
you
no
on
her
return
she
asks
the
anxious
relations
in
the
house
has
his
soul
come
back
and
they
must
answer
quickly
yes
the
soul
of
the
sick
man
has
come
then
she
stands
beside
the
patient
blows
out
the
candle
which
had
lighted
the
returning
soul
on
its
way
and
strews
rice
on
the
head
of
the
convalescent
saying
cluck
soul
cluck
soul
cluck
soul
last
of
all
she
fastens
on
his
right
wrist
a
bracelet
or
ring
which
he
must
wear
for
three
days
in
this
case
we
see
that
the
saving
of
the
soul
is
combined
with
a
vicarious
sacrifice
to
the
ghost
who
receives
a
puppet
on
which
to
work
his
will
instead
of
on
the
poor
soul
in
san
cristoval
one
of
the
melanesian
islands
the
vicarious
sacrifice
takes
the
form
of
a
pig
or
a
fish
a
malignant
ghost
of
the
name
of
tapia
is
supposed
to
have
seized
on
the
sick
man
s
soul
and
tied
it
up
to
a
accordingly
a
man
who
has
influence
with
tapia
takes
a
pig
or
fish
to
the
holy
place
where
the
ghost
resides
and
offers
it
to
him
saying
this
is
for
you
to
eat
in
place
of
that
man
eat
this
don
t
kill
this
satisfies
the
ghost
the
soul
is
loosed
from
the
tree
and
carried
back
to
the
sufferer
who
naturally
recovers
a
regular
part
of
the
of
a
dyak
is
a
crystal
into
which
he
gazes
to
detect
the
of
a
lost
soul
or
to
identify
the
demon
who
is
causing
the
sickness
in
one
of
the
new
hebrides
a
ghost
will
sometimes
impound
the
souls
of
trespassers
within
a
magic
fence
in
his
garden
and
will
only
consent
to
pull
up
the
fence
and
let
the
souls
out
on
receiving
an
unqualified
apology
and
a
satisfactory
assurance
that
no
personal
disrespect
was
intended
in
motlav
another
melanesian
island
it
is
enough
to
call
out
the
sick
man
s
name
in
the
sacred
place
where
he
rashly
intruded
and
then
when
the
cry
of
the
kingfisher
or
some
other
bird
is
heard
to
shout
come
back
to
the
soul
of
the
sick
man
and
run
back
with
it
to
the
house
it
is
a
comparatively
easy
matter
to
save
a
soul
which
is
merely
tied
up
to
a
tree
or
detained
as
a
vagrant
in
a
pound
but
it
is
a
far
harder
task
to
fetch
it
up
from
the
nether
world
if
it
once
gets
down
there
when
a
buryat
shaman
is
called
in
to
attend
a
patient
the
first
thing
he
does
is
to
ascertain
where
exactly
the
soul
of
the
invalid
is
for
it
may
have
strayed
or
been
stolen
or
be
languishing
in
the
prison
of
the
gloomy
erlik
lord
of
the
world
below
if
it
is
anywhere
in
the
neighbourhood
the
shaman
soon
catches
and
replaces
it
in
the
patient
s
body
if
it
is
far
away
he
searches
the
wide
world
till
he
finds
it
ransacking
the
deep
woods
the
lonely
steppes
and
the
bottom
of
the
sea
not
to
be
thrown
off
the
scent
even
though
the
cunning
soul
runs
to
the
in
the
hope
that
its
footprints
will
be
lost
among
the
tracks
of
the
sheep
but
when
the
whole
world
has
been
searched
in
vain
for
the
errant
soul
the
shaman
knows
that
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
down
to
hell
and
seek
the
lost
one
among
the
spirits
in
prison
at
the
stern
call
of
duty
he
does
not
flinch
though
he
knows
that
the
journey
is
toilsome
and
that
the
travelling
expenses
which
are
naturally
defrayed
by
the
patient
are
very
heavy
sometimes
the
lord
of
the
infernal
regions
will
only
agree
to
release
the
soul
on
condition
of
receiving
another
in
its
stead
and
that
one
the
soul
of
the
sick
man
s
dearest
friend
if
the
patient
consents
to
the
substitution
the
shaman
turns
himself
into
a
hawk
pounces
upon
the
soul
of
the
friend
as
it
soars
from
his
slumbering
body
in
the
form
of
a
lark
and
hands
over
the
fluttering
struggling
thing
to
the
grim
warden
of
the
dead
who
thereupon
sets
the
soul
of
the
sick
man
at
liberty
so
the
sick
man
recovers
and
his
friend
dies
when
a
shaman
declares
that
the
soul
of
a
sick
thompson
indian
has
been
carried
off
by
the
dead
the
good
physician
who
is
the
shaman
himself
puts
on
a
conical
mask
and
sets
off
in
pursuit
he
now
acts
as
if
on
a
journey
jumping
rivers
and
such
like
obstacles
searching
talking
and
sometimes
engaging
in
a
tussle
for
the
possession
of
the
soul
his
first
step
is
to
repair
to
the
old
trail
by
which
the
souls
of
heathen
thompsons
went
to
the
for
nowadays
the
souls
of
christian
thompsons
travel
by
a
new
road
if
he
fails
to
find
the
tracks
of
the
lost
soul
there
he
searches
all
the
graveyards
one
after
the
other
and
almost
always
discovers
it
in
one
of
them
sometimes
he
succeeds
in
heading
off
the
departing
soul
by
taking
a
short
cut
to
the
other
world
a
shaman
can
only
stay
a
short
time
there
so
as
soon
as
he
lays
hands
on
the
soul
he
is
after
he
bolts
with
it
the
other
souls
give
chase
but
he
stamps
with
his
foot
on
which
he
wears
a
rattle
made
of
deer
s
hoofs
at
the
rattle
of
the
hoofs
the
ghosts
retreat
and
he
hurries
on
a
bolder
shaman
will
sometimes
ask
the
ghosts
for
the
soul
and
if
they
refuse
to
give
it
he
will
wrest
it
from
them
they
attack
him
but
he
clubs
them
and
brings
away
the
soul
by
force
when
he
comes
back
to
the
world
he
takes
off
his
mask
and
shews
his
club
all
bloody
then
the
people
know
he
had
a
desperate
struggle
if
he
foresees
that
the
harrowing
of
hell
is
likely
to
prove
a
tough
job
he
increases
the
number
of
wooden
pins
in
his
mask
the
rescued
soul
is
placed
by
him
on
the
patient
s
head
and
so
returned
to
his
body
among
the
twana
indians
of
washington
state
the
descent
of
the
into
the
nether
world
to
rescue
lost
souls
is
represented
in
pantomime
before
the
eyes
of
the
spectators
who
include
women
and
children
as
well
as
men
the
surface
of
the
ground
is
often
broken
to
facilitate
the
descent
of
the
rescue
party
when
the
adventurous
band
is
supposed
to
have
reached
the
bottom
they
journey
along
cross
at
least
one
stream
and
travel
till
they
come
to
the
abode
of
the
spirits
these
they
surprise
and
after
a
desperate
struggle
sustained
with
great
ardour
and
a
prodigious
noise
they
succeed
in
rescuing
the
poor
souls
and
so
wrapping
them
up
in
cloth
they
make
the
best
of
their
way
back
to
the
upper
world
and
restore
the
recovered
souls
to
their
owners
who
have
been
seen
to
cry
heartily
for
joy
at
receiving
them
back
often
the
abduction
of
a
man
s
soul
is
set
down
to
demons
the
annamites
believe
that
when
a
man
meets
a
demon
and
speaks
to
him
the
demon
inhales
the
man
s
breath
and
soul
the
souls
of
the
bahnars
of
eastern
are
apt
to
be
carried
off
by
evil
spirits
and
the
modes
of
recovering
them
are
various
if
a
man
suffers
from
a
colic
the
sorcerer
may
say
that
in
planting
maize
or
he
has
pierced
the
stomach
of
a
certain
god
who
lives
like
a
mole
in
the
ground
and
that
the
injured
deity
has
punished
him
by
abstracting
his
soul
and
burying
it
under
a
plant
hence
the
cure
for
the
colic
is
to
pull
up
the
plant
and
water
the
hole
with
millet
wine
and
the
blood
of
a
fowl
a
goat
or
a
pig
again
if
a
child
falls
ill
in
the
forest
or
the
fields
it
is
because
some
devil
has
made
off
with
its
soul
to
retrieve
this
spiritual
loss
the
sorcerer
constructs
an
apparatus
which
comprises
an
in
an
a
little
waxen
image
of
the
sick
child
and
a
small
bamboo
full
of
millet
wine
this
apparatus
he
sets
up
at
a
praying
the
devil
to
drink
the
wine
and
surrender
the
stolen
soul
by
depositing
it
in
the
then
he
returns
to
the
house
and
putting
a
little
cotton
to
the
child
s
head
restores
the
soul
to
its
owner
sometimes
the
sorcerer
lays
a
trap
for
the
thievish
demon
the
bait
consisting
of
the
liver
of
a
pig
or
a
fowl
and
the
handle
of
a
little
mattock
at
nightfall
he
sets
the
trap
at
a
and
lies
in
wait
hard
by
while
the
devil
is
licking
the
blood
and
munching
the
liver
the
artful
sorcerer
pounces
out
on
him
and
after
a
severe
struggle
wrests
the
soul
from
his
clutches
returning
to
the
village
victorious
but
breathless
and
bleeding
from
his
terrific
encounter
with
the
enemy
of
souls
fits
and
convulsions
are
generally
set
down
by
the
chinese
to
the
agency
of
certain
mischievous
spirits
who
love
to
draw
men
s
souls
out
of
their
bodies
at
amoy
the
spirits
who
serve
babies
and
children
in
this
way
rejoice
in
the
titles
of
celestial
agencies
bestriding
galloping
horses
and
literary
graduates
residing
halfway
up
in
the
when
an
infant
is
writhing
in
convulsions
the
frightened
mother
hastens
to
the
roof
of
the
house
and
waving
about
a
bamboo
pole
to
which
one
of
the
child
s
garments
is
attached
cries
out
several
times
my
child
come
back
return
home
meantime
another
inmate
of
the
house
bangs
away
at
a
gong
in
the
hope
of
attracting
the
attention
of
the
strayed
soul
which
is
supposed
to
recognise
the
familiar
garment
and
to
slip
into
it
the
garment
containing
the
soul
is
then
placed
on
or
beside
the
child
and
if
the
child
does
not
die
recovery
is
sure
to
follow
sooner
or
later
similarly
we
saw
that
some
indians
catch
a
man
s
lost
soul
in
his
boots
and
restore
it
to
his
body
by
putting
his
feet
into
them
if
galelareese
mariners
are
sailing
past
certain
rocks
or
come
to
a
river
where
they
never
were
before
they
must
wash
their
faces
for
otherwise
the
spirits
of
the
rocks
or
the
river
would
snatch
away
their
souls
when
a
dyak
is
about
to
leave
a
forest
through
which
he
has
been
walking
alone
he
never
forgets
to
ask
the
demons
to
give
him
back
his
soul
for
it
may
be
that
some
has
carried
it
off
for
the
abduction
of
a
soul
may
take
place
without
its
owner
being
aware
of
his
loss
and
it
may
happen
either
while
he
is
awake
or
asleep
the
papuans
of
geelvink
bay
in
new
guinea
are
apt
to
think
that
the
mists
which
sometimes
hang
about
the
tops
of
tall
trees
in
their
tropical
forests
envelop
a
spirit
or
god
called
narbrooi
who
draws
away
the
breath
or
soul
of
those
whom
he
loves
thus
causing
them
to
languish
and
die
accordingly
when
a
man
lies
sick
a
friend
or
relation
will
go
to
one
of
these
trees
and
endeavour
to
recover
the
lost
soul
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
he
makes
a
peculiar
sound
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
spirit
and
lights
a
cigar
in
its
curling
smoke
his
fancy
discerns
the
fair
and
youthful
form
of
narbrooi
himself
who
decked
with
flowers
appears
and
informs
the
anxious
enquirer
whether
the
soul
of
his
sick
friend
is
with
him
or
not
if
it
is
the
man
asks
has
he
done
any
wrong
oh
no
the
spirit
answers
i
love
him
and
therefore
i
have
taken
him
to
so
the
man
lays
down
an
offering
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
goes
home
with
the
soul
of
the
sufferer
in
a
straw
bag
arrived
at
the
house
he
empties
the
bag
with
its
precious
contents
over
the
sick
man
s
head
rubs
his
arms
and
hands
with
which
he
had
first
chewed
small
and
then
ties
a
bandage
round
one
of
the
patient
s
wrists
if
the
bandage
bursts
it
is
a
sign
that
narbrooi
has
repented
of
his
bargain
and
is
drawing
away
the
sufferer
once
more
to
himself
in
the
moluccas
when
a
man
is
unwell
it
is
thought
that
some
devil
has
carried
away
his
soul
to
the
tree
mountain
or
hill
where
he
the
devil
resides
a
sorcerer
having
pointed
out
the
devil
s
abode
the
friends
of
the
patient
carry
thither
cooked
rice
fruit
fish
raw
eggs
a
hen
a
chicken
a
silken
robe
gold
armlets
and
so
forth
having
set
out
the
food
in
order
they
pray
saying
we
come
to
offer
to
you
o
devil
this
offering
of
food
clothes
gold
and
so
on
take
it
and
release
the
soul
of
the
patient
for
whom
we
pray
let
it
return
to
his
body
and
he
who
now
is
sick
shall
be
made
then
they
eat
a
little
and
let
the
hen
loose
as
a
ransom
for
the
soul
of
the
patient
also
they
put
down
the
raw
eggs
but
the
silken
robe
the
gold
and
the
armlets
they
take
home
with
them
as
soon
as
they
are
come
to
the
house
they
place
a
flat
bowl
containing
the
offerings
which
have
been
brought
back
at
the
sick
man
s
head
and
say
to
him
now
is
your
soul
released
and
you
shall
fare
well
and
live
to
grey
hairs
on
the
a
more
modern
account
from
the
same
region
describes
how
the
friend
of
the
patient
after
depositing
his
offerings
on
the
spot
where
the
missing
soul
is
supposed
to
be
calls
out
thrice
the
name
of
the
sick
person
adding
come
with
me
come
with
then
he
returns
making
a
motion
with
a
cloth
as
if
he
had
caught
the
soul
in
it
he
must
not
look
to
right
or
left
or
speak
a
word
to
any
one
he
meets
but
must
go
straight
to
the
patient
s
house
at
the
door
he
stands
and
calling
out
the
sick
person
s
name
asks
whether
he
is
returned
being
answered
from
within
that
he
is
returned
he
enters
and
lays
the
cloth
in
which
he
has
caught
the
soul
on
the
patient
s
throat
saying
now
you
are
returned
to
the
sometimes
a
substitute
is
provided
a
doll
dressed
up
in
gay
clothing
and
tinsel
is
offered
to
the
demon
in
exchange
for
the
patient
s
soul
with
these
words
give
us
back
the
ugly
one
which
you
have
taken
away
and
receive
this
pretty
one
among
the
alfoors
or
toradjas
of
poso
in
central
celebes
a
wooden
puppet
is
offered
to
the
demon
as
a
substitute
for
the
soul
which
he
has
abstracted
and
the
patient
must
touch
the
puppet
in
order
to
identify
himself
with
it
the
effigy
is
then
hung
on
a
bamboo
pole
which
is
planted
at
the
place
of
sacrifice
outside
of
the
house
here
too
are
deposited
offerings
of
rice
an
egg
a
little
wood
which
is
afterwards
kindled
a
sherd
of
a
broken
and
so
forth
a
long
rattan
extends
from
the
place
of
sacrifice
to
the
sufferer
who
grasps
one
end
of
it
firmly
for
along
it
his
lost
soul
will
return
when
the
devil
has
kindly
released
it
all
being
ready
the
priestess
informs
the
demon
that
he
has
come
to
the
wrong
place
and
that
there
are
no
doubt
much
better
quarters
where
he
could
reside
then
the
father
of
the
patient
standing
beside
the
offerings
takes
up
his
parable
as
follows
o
demon
we
forgot
to
sacrifice
to
you
you
have
visited
us
with
this
sickness
will
you
now
go
away
from
us
to
some
other
place
we
have
made
ready
provisions
for
you
on
the
journey
see
here
is
a
here
are
rice
fire
and
a
fowl
o
demon
go
away
from
with
that
the
priestess
strews
rice
towards
the
to
lure
back
the
wandering
soul
and
the
fowl
promised
to
the
devil
is
thrown
in
the
same
direction
but
is
instantly
jerked
back
again
by
a
string
which
in
a
spirit
of
intelligent
economy
has
been
previously
attached
to
its
leg
the
demon
is
now
supposed
to
accept
the
puppet
which
hangs
from
the
pole
and
to
release
the
soul
which
sliding
down
the
pole
and
along
the
rattan
returns
to
its
proper
owner
and
lest
the
evil
spirit
should
repent
of
the
barter
which
has
just
been
effected
all
communication
with
him
is
broken
off
by
cutting
down
the
pole
similarly
the
mongols
make
up
a
horse
of
and
a
doll
and
invite
the
demon
to
take
the
doll
instead
of
the
patient
and
to
ride
away
on
the
horse
a
yakut
shaman
rigged
out
in
his
professional
costume
with
his
drum
in
his
hand
will
boldly
descend
into
the
lower
world
and
haggle
with
the
demon
who
has
carried
off
a
sick
man
s
soul
not
uncommonly
the
demon
proves
amenable
to
reason
and
in
consideration
of
the
narrow
circumstances
of
the
patient
s
family
will
accept
a
more
moderate
ransom
than
he
at
first
demanded
for
instance
he
may
be
brought
to
put
up
with
the
skin
of
an
arctic
hare
or
arctic
fox
instead
of
a
foal
or
a
steer
the
bargain
being
struck
the
shaman
hurries
back
to
the
sufferer
s
bedside
from
which
to
the
merely
carnal
eye
he
has
never
stirred
and
informs
the
anxious
relatives
of
the
success
of
his
mission
they
in
turn
gladly
hasten
to
provide
the
ransom
demons
are
especially
feared
by
persons
who
have
just
entered
a
new
house
hence
at
a
among
the
alfoors
of
minahassa
in
celebes
the
priest
performs
a
ceremony
for
the
purpose
of
restoring
their
souls
to
the
inmates
he
hangs
up
a
bag
at
the
place
of
sacrifice
and
then
goes
through
a
list
of
the
gods
there
are
so
many
of
them
that
this
takes
him
the
whole
night
through
without
stopping
in
the
morning
he
offers
the
gods
an
egg
and
some
rice
by
this
time
the
souls
of
the
household
are
supposed
to
be
gathered
in
the
bag
so
the
priest
takes
the
bag
and
holding
it
on
the
head
of
the
master
of
the
house
says
here
you
have
your
soul
go
soul
away
he
then
does
the
same
saying
the
same
words
to
the
housewife
and
all
the
other
members
of
the
family
amongst
the
same
alfoors
one
way
of
recovering
a
sick
man
s
soul
is
to
let
down
a
bowl
by
a
belt
out
of
a
window
and
fish
for
the
soul
till
it
is
caught
in
the
bowl
and
hauled
up
and
among
the
same
people
when
a
priest
is
bringing
back
a
sick
man
s
soul
which
he
has
caught
in
a
cloth
he
is
preceded
by
a
girl
holding
the
large
leaf
of
a
certain
palm
over
his
head
as
an
umbrella
to
keep
him
and
the
soul
from
getting
wet
in
case
it
should
rain
and
he
is
followed
by
a
man
brandishing
a
sword
to
deter
other
souls
from
any
attempt
at
rescuing
the
captured
spirit
in
nias
when
a
man
dreams
that
a
pig
is
fastened
under
a
neighbour
s
house
it
is
a
sign
that
some
one
in
that
house
will
die
they
think
that
the
is
drawing
away
the
shadows
or
souls
of
that
household
from
this
world
of
shadows
to
his
own
bright
world
of
radiant
light
and
a
ceremony
must
needs
be
performed
to
win
back
these
passing
souls
to
earth
accordingly
while
it
is
still
night
the
priest
begins
to
drum
and
pray
and
he
continues
his
orisons
till
about
nine
o
clock
next
morning
then
he
takes
his
stand
at
an
opening
in
the
roof
through
which
he
can
behold
the
sun
and
spreading
out
a
cloth
waits
till
the
beams
of
the
morning
sun
fall
full
upon
it
in
the
sunbeams
he
thinks
the
wandering
souls
have
come
back
again
so
he
wraps
the
cloth
up
tightly
and
quitting
the
opening
in
the
roof
hastens
with
his
precious
charge
to
the
expectant
household
before
each
member
of
it
he
stops
and
dipping
his
fingers
into
the
cloth
takes
out
his
or
her
soul
and
restores
it
to
the
owner
by
touching
the
person
on
the
forehead
the
thompson
indians
of
british
columbia
think
that
the
setting
sun
draws
the
souls
of
men
away
towards
it
hence
they
will
never
sleep
with
their
heads
to
the
sunset
the
samoans
tell
how
two
young
wizards
passing
a
house
where
a
chief
lay
very
sick
saw
a
company
of
gods
from
the
mountain
sitting
in
the
doorway
they
were
handing
from
one
to
another
the
soul
of
the
dying
chief
it
was
wrapt
in
a
leaf
and
had
been
passed
from
the
gods
inside
the
house
to
those
sitting
in
the
doorway
one
of
the
gods
handed
the
soul
to
one
of
the
wizards
taking
him
for
a
god
in
the
dark
for
it
was
night
then
all
the
gods
rose
up
and
went
away
but
the
wizard
kept
the
chief
s
soul
in
the
morning
some
women
went
with
a
present
of
fine
mats
to
fetch
a
famous
physician
the
wizards
were
sitting
on
the
shore
as
the
women
passed
and
they
said
to
the
women
give
us
the
mats
and
we
will
heal
so
they
went
to
the
chief
s
house
he
was
very
ill
his
jaw
hung
down
and
his
end
seemed
near
but
the
wizards
undid
the
leaf
and
let
the
soul
into
him
again
and
forthwith
he
brightened
up
and
lived
the
battas
or
bataks
of
sumatra
believe
that
the
soul
of
a
living
man
may
transmigrate
into
the
body
of
an
animal
hence
for
example
the
doctor
is
sometimes
desired
to
extract
the
patient
s
soul
from
the
body
of
a
fowl
in
which
it
has
been
hidden
away
by
an
evil
spirit
sometimes
the
lost
soul
is
brought
back
in
a
visible
shape
in
melanesia
a
woman
knowing
that
a
neighbour
was
at
the
point
of
death
heard
a
rustling
in
her
house
as
of
a
moth
fluttering
just
at
the
moment
when
a
noise
of
weeping
and
lamentation
told
her
that
the
soul
was
flown
she
caught
the
fluttering
thing
between
her
hands
and
ran
with
it
crying
out
that
she
had
caught
the
soul
but
though
she
opened
her
hands
above
the
mouth
of
the
corpse
it
did
not
revive
in
lepers
island
one
of
the
new
hebrides
for
ten
days
after
a
birth
the
father
is
careful
not
to
exert
himself
or
the
baby
would
suffer
for
it
if
during
this
time
he
goes
away
to
any
distance
he
will
bring
back
with
him
on
his
return
a
little
stone
representing
the
infant
s
soul
arrived
at
home
he
cries
come
hither
and
puts
down
the
stone
in
the
house
then
he
waits
till
the
child
sneezes
at
which
he
cries
here
it
is
for
now
he
knows
that
the
little
soul
has
not
been
lost
after
all
the
salish
or
flathead
indians
of
oregon
believe
that
a
man
s
soul
may
be
separated
for
a
time
from
his
body
without
causing
death
and
without
the
man
being
aware
of
his
loss
it
is
necessary
however
that
the
lost
soul
should
be
soon
found
and
restored
to
its
owner
or
he
will
die
the
name
of
the
man
who
has
lost
his
soul
is
revealed
in
a
dream
to
the
who
hastens
to
inform
the
sufferer
of
his
loss
generally
a
number
of
men
have
sustained
a
like
loss
at
the
same
time
all
their
names
are
revealed
to
the
and
all
employ
him
to
recover
their
souls
the
whole
night
long
these
soulless
men
go
about
the
village
from
lodge
to
lodge
dancing
and
singing
towards
daybreak
they
go
into
a
separate
lodge
which
is
closed
up
so
as
to
be
totally
dark
a
small
hole
is
then
made
in
the
roof
through
which
the
with
a
bunch
of
feathers
brushes
in
the
souls
in
the
shape
of
bits
of
bone
and
the
like
which
he
receives
on
a
piece
of
matting
a
fire
is
next
kindled
by
the
light
of
which
the
sorts
out
the
souls
first
he
puts
aside
the
souls
of
dead
people
of
which
there
are
usually
several
for
if
he
were
to
give
the
soul
of
a
dead
person
to
a
living
man
the
man
would
die
instantly
next
he
picks
out
the
souls
of
all
the
persons
present
and
making
them
all
to
sit
down
before
him
he
takes
the
soul
of
each
in
the
shape
of
a
splinter
of
bone
wood
or
shell
and
placing
it
on
the
owner
s
head
pats
it
with
many
prayers
and
contortions
till
it
descends
into
the
heart
and
so
resumes
its
proper
place
in
amboyna
the
sorcerer
to
recover
a
soul
detained
by
demons
plucks
a
branch
from
a
tree
and
waving
it
to
and
fro
as
if
to
catch
something
calls
out
the
sick
man
s
name
returning
he
strikes
the
patient
over
the
head
and
body
with
the
branch
into
which
the
lost
soul
is
supposed
to
have
passed
and
from
which
it
returns
to
the
patient
in
the
babar
islands
offerings
for
evil
spirits
are
laid
at
the
root
of
a
great
tree
from
which
a
leaf
is
plucked
and
pressed
on
the
patient
s
forehead
and
breast
the
lost
soul
which
is
in
the
leaf
is
thus
restored
to
its
owner
in
some
other
islands
of
the
same
seas
when
a
man
returns
ill
and
speechless
from
the
forest
it
is
inferred
that
the
evil
spirits
which
dwell
in
the
great
trees
have
caught
and
kept
his
soul
offerings
of
food
are
therefore
left
under
a
tree
and
the
soul
is
brought
home
in
a
piece
of
wax
amongst
the
dyaks
of
sarawak
the
priest
conjures
the
lost
soul
into
a
cup
where
it
is
seen
by
the
uninitiated
as
a
lock
of
hair
but
by
the
initiated
as
a
miniature
human
being
this
the
priest
pokes
back
into
the
patient
s
body
through
an
invisible
hole
in
his
skull
in
nias
the
sick
man
s
soul
is
restored
to
him
in
the
shape
of
a
firefly
visible
only
to
the
sorcerer
who
catches
it
in
a
cloth
and
places
it
on
the
forehead
of
the
patient
amongst
the
indians
of
santiago
tepehuacan
if
a
child
has
fallen
from
the
arms
of
its
bearer
and
an
illness
has
resulted
from
the
fall
the
parents
will
take
the
child
s
shirt
stretch
it
out
on
the
spot
where
the
little
one
fell
and
say
come
come
come
back
to
the
then
they
bring
back
a
little
of
the
earth
wrapped
up
in
the
shirt
and
put
the
shirt
on
the
child
they
say
that
in
this
manner
the
spirit
is
replaced
in
the
child
s
body
and
that
he
will
recover
with
this
we
may
compare
an
irish
custom
reported
by
camden
when
any
one
happens
to
fall
he
springs
up
again
and
turning
round
thrice
to
the
right
digs
the
earth
with
a
sword
or
knife
and
takes
up
a
turf
because
they
say
the
earth
restores
his
shade
to
him
but
if
he
falls
sick
within
two
or
three
days
thereafter
a
woman
skilled
in
these
matters
is
sent
to
the
spot
and
there
says
i
call
thee
from
the
east
and
west
from
the
south
and
north
from
the
groves
woods
rivers
marshes
fairies
white
red
and
black
and
so
forth
after
uttering
certain
short
prayers
she
returns
home
to
the
sick
person
and
whispering
in
his
ear
another
prayer
along
with
a
puts
some
burning
coals
into
a
cup
of
clean
water
and
so
decides
whether
the
distemper
has
been
inflicted
by
the
fairies
here
though
camden
is
not
very
explicit
and
he
probably
did
not
quite
understand
the
custom
he
describes
it
seems
plain
that
the
shade
or
soul
of
a
man
who
has
fallen
is
conceived
as
adhering
to
the
ground
where
he
fell
accordingly
he
seeks
to
regain
possession
of
it
by
digging
up
the
earth
but
if
he
fails
to
recover
it
he
sends
a
wise
woman
to
the
spot
to
win
back
his
soul
from
the
fairies
who
are
detaining
it
the
ancient
egyptians
held
that
a
dead
man
is
not
in
a
state
to
enter
on
the
life
hereafter
until
his
soul
has
been
found
and
restored
to
his
mummified
body
the
vital
spark
had
been
commonly
devoured
by
the
malignant
god
sit
who
concealed
his
true
form
in
the
likeness
of
a
horned
beast
such
as
an
ox
or
a
gazelle
so
the
priests
went
in
quest
of
the
missing
spirit
slaughtered
the
animal
which
had
devoured
it
and
cutting
open
the
carcase
found
the
soul
still
undigested
in
its
stomach
afterwards
the
son
of
the
deceased
embraced
the
mummy
or
the
image
of
his
father
in
order
to
restore
his
soul
to
him
formerly
it
was
customary
to
place
the
skin
of
the
slain
beast
on
the
dead
man
for
the
purpose
of
recruiting
his
strength
with
that
of
the
animal
again
souls
may
be
extracted
from
their
bodies
or
detained
on
their
wanderings
not
only
by
ghosts
and
demons
but
also
by
men
especially
by
sorcerers
in
fiji
if
a
criminal
refused
to
confess
the
chief
sent
for
a
scarf
with
which
to
catch
away
the
soul
of
the
at
the
sight
or
even
at
the
mention
of
the
scarf
the
culprit
generally
made
a
clean
breast
for
if
he
did
not
the
scarf
would
be
waved
over
his
head
till
his
soul
was
caught
in
it
when
it
would
be
carefully
folded
up
and
nailed
to
the
end
of
a
chief
s
canoe
and
for
want
of
his
soul
the
criminal
would
pine
and
die
the
sorcerers
of
danger
island
used
to
set
snares
for
souls
the
snares
were
made
of
stout
cinet
about
fifteen
to
thirty
feet
long
with
loops
on
either
side
of
different
sizes
to
suit
the
different
sizes
of
souls
for
fat
souls
there
were
large
loops
for
thin
souls
there
were
small
ones
when
a
man
was
sick
against
whom
the
sorcerers
had
a
grudge
they
set
up
these
near
his
house
and
watched
for
the
flight
of
his
soul
if
in
the
shape
of
a
bird
or
an
insect
it
was
caught
in
the
snare
the
man
would
infallibly
die
when
a
polynesian
mother
desired
that
the
child
in
her
womb
should
grow
up
to
be
a
great
warrior
or
a
great
thief
she
repaired
to
the
temple
of
the
oro
or
of
the
hiro
there
the
priest
obligingly
caught
the
spirit
of
the
god
in
a
snare
made
of
fibre
and
then
infused
it
into
the
woman
when
the
child
was
born
the
mother
took
it
to
the
temple
and
dedicated
it
to
the
god
with
whose
divine
spirit
the
infant
was
already
possessed
the
algonquin
indians
also
used
nets
to
catch
souls
but
only
as
a
measure
of
defence
they
feared
lest
passing
souls
which
had
just
quitted
the
bodies
of
dying
people
should
enter
their
huts
and
carry
off
the
souls
of
the
inmates
to
deadland
so
they
spread
nets
about
their
houses
to
catch
and
entangle
these
ghostly
intruders
in
the
meshes
among
the
sereres
of
senegambia
when
a
man
wishes
to
revenge
himself
on
his
enemy
he
goes
to
the
chief
and
priest
in
one
and
prevails
on
him
by
presents
to
conjure
the
soul
of
his
enemy
into
a
large
jar
of
red
earthenware
which
is
then
deposited
under
a
consecrated
tree
the
man
whose
soul
is
shut
up
in
the
jar
soon
dies
among
the
baoules
of
the
ivory
coast
it
happened
once
that
a
chief
s
soul
was
extracted
by
the
magic
of
an
enemy
who
succeeded
in
shutting
it
up
in
a
box
to
recover
it
two
men
held
a
garment
of
the
sick
man
while
a
witch
performed
certain
enchantments
after
a
time
she
declared
that
the
soul
was
now
in
the
garment
which
was
accordingly
rolled
up
and
hastily
wrapped
about
the
invalid
for
the
purpose
of
restoring
his
spirit
to
him
some
of
the
congo
negroes
think
that
enchanters
can
get
possession
of
human
souls
and
enclosing
them
in
tusks
of
ivory
sell
them
to
the
white
man
who
makes
them
work
for
him
in
his
country
under
the
sea
it
is
believed
that
very
many
of
the
coast
labourers
are
men
thus
obtained
so
when
these
people
go
to
trade
they
often
look
anxiously
about
for
their
dead
relations
the
man
whose
soul
is
thus
sold
into
slavery
will
die
in
due
course
if
not
at
the
in
some
parts
of
west
africa
indeed
wizards
are
continually
setting
traps
to
catch
souls
that
wander
from
their
bodies
in
sleep
and
when
they
have
caught
one
they
tie
it
up
over
the
fire
and
as
it
shrivels
in
the
heat
the
owner
sickens
this
is
done
not
out
of
any
grudge
towards
the
sufferer
but
purely
as
a
matter
of
business
the
wizard
does
not
care
whose
soul
he
has
captured
and
will
readily
restore
it
to
its
owner
if
only
he
is
paid
for
doing
so
some
sorcerers
keep
regular
asylums
for
strayed
souls
and
anybody
who
has
lost
or
mislaid
his
own
soul
can
always
have
another
one
from
the
asylum
on
payment
of
the
usual
fee
no
blame
whatever
attaches
to
men
who
keep
these
private
asylums
or
set
traps
for
passing
souls
it
is
their
profession
and
in
the
exercise
of
it
they
are
actuated
by
no
harsh
or
unkindly
feelings
but
there
are
also
wretches
who
from
pure
spite
or
for
the
sake
of
lucre
set
and
bait
traps
with
the
deliberate
purpose
of
catching
the
soul
of
a
particular
man
and
in
the
bottom
of
the
pot
hidden
by
the
bait
are
knives
and
sharp
hooks
which
tear
and
rend
the
poor
soul
either
killing
it
outright
or
mauling
it
so
as
to
impair
the
health
of
its
owner
when
it
succeeds
in
escaping
and
returning
to
him
miss
kingsley
knew
a
kruman
who
became
very
anxious
about
his
soul
because
for
several
nights
he
had
smelt
in
his
dreams
the
savoury
smell
of
smoked
crawfish
seasoned
with
red
pepper
clearly
some
had
set
a
trap
baited
with
this
dainty
for
his
intending
to
do
him
grievous
bodily
or
rather
spiritual
harm
and
for
the
next
few
nights
great
pains
were
taken
to
keep
his
soul
from
straying
abroad
in
his
sleep
in
the
sweltering
heat
of
the
tropical
night
he
lay
sweating
and
snorting
under
a
blanket
his
nose
and
mouth
tied
up
with
a
handkerchief
to
prevent
the
escape
of
his
precious
soul
when
dyaks
of
the
upper
melawie
are
about
to
go
out
they
take
the
precaution
of
securing
the
souls
of
their
enemies
before
they
attempt
to
kill
their
bodies
calculating
apparently
that
mere
bodily
death
will
soon
follow
the
spiritual
death
or
capture
of
the
soul
with
this
intention
they
clear
a
small
space
in
the
underwood
of
the
forest
and
set
up
in
the
clearing
one
of
those
miniature
houses
in
which
it
is
customary
to
deposit
the
ashes
of
the
dead
food
is
placed
in
the
little
house
which
though
raised
on
four
posts
is
connected
with
the
ground
by
a
tiny
inverted
ladder
of
the
sort
up
which
spirits
are
believed
to
swarm
when
these
preparations
have
been
completed
the
leader
of
the
expedition
comes
and
sits
down
a
little
way
from
the
miniature
house
and
addressing
the
spirits
of
kinsmen
who
had
the
misfortune
to
be
beheaded
by
their
enemies
he
says
o
ghosts
of
come
speedily
back
to
our
village
we
have
rice
in
abundance
our
trees
all
bear
ripe
fruit
our
baskets
are
full
to
the
brim
o
ghosts
come
swiftly
back
and
forget
not
to
bring
your
new
friends
and
acquaintances
with
but
by
the
new
friends
and
acquaintances
of
the
ghosts
he
means
the
souls
of
the
enemies
against
whom
he
is
about
to
lead
the
expedition
meantime
the
other
warriors
have
hidden
themselves
close
by
behind
trees
and
bushes
and
are
listening
with
all
their
ears
when
the
cry
of
an
animal
is
heard
in
the
forest
or
a
humming
sound
seems
to
issue
from
the
little
house
it
is
a
sign
that
the
ghosts
of
their
friends
have
come
bringing
with
them
the
souls
of
their
enemies
which
are
accordingly
at
their
mercy
at
that
the
lurking
warriors
leap
forth
from
their
ambush
and
with
brandished
blades
hew
and
slash
at
the
souls
of
their
foemen
swarming
unseen
in
the
air
taken
completely
by
surprise
the
souls
flee
in
all
directions
and
are
fain
to
hide
under
every
leaf
and
stone
on
the
ground
but
even
here
their
retreat
is
cut
off
for
now
the
leader
of
the
expedition
is
hard
at
work
grubbing
up
with
his
hands
every
stone
and
leaf
to
right
and
left
and
thrusting
them
with
feverish
haste
into
the
basket
which
he
at
once
ties
up
securely
he
now
flatters
himself
that
he
has
the
souls
of
the
enemy
safe
in
his
possession
and
when
in
the
course
of
the
expedition
the
heads
of
the
foe
are
severed
from
their
bodies
he
will
pack
them
into
the
same
basket
in
which
their
souls
are
already
languishing
in
captivity
in
hawaii
there
were
sorcerers
who
caught
souls
of
living
people
shut
them
up
in
calabashes
and
gave
them
to
people
to
eat
by
squeezing
a
captured
soul
in
their
hands
they
discovered
the
place
where
people
had
been
secretly
buried
amongst
the
canadian
indians
when
a
wizard
wished
to
kill
a
man
he
sent
out
his
familiar
spirits
who
brought
him
the
victim
s
soul
in
the
shape
of
a
stone
or
the
like
the
wizard
struck
the
soul
with
a
sword
or
an
axe
till
it
bled
profusely
and
as
it
bled
the
man
to
whom
it
belonged
fell
ill
and
died
in
amboyna
if
a
doctor
is
convinced
that
a
patient
s
soul
has
been
carried
away
by
a
demon
beyond
recovery
he
seeks
to
supply
its
place
with
a
soul
abstracted
from
another
man
for
this
purpose
he
goes
by
night
to
a
house
and
asks
who
s
there
if
an
inmate
is
incautious
enough
to
answer
the
doctor
takes
up
from
before
the
door
a
clod
of
earth
into
which
the
soul
of
the
person
who
replied
is
thought
to
have
passed
this
clod
the
doctor
lays
under
the
sick
man
s
pillow
and
performs
certain
ceremonies
by
which
the
stolen
soul
is
conveyed
into
the
patient
s
body
then
as
he
goes
home
the
doctor
fires
two
shots
to
frighten
the
soul
from
returning
to
its
proper
owner
a
karen
wizard
will
catch
the
wandering
soul
of
a
sleeper
and
transfer
it
to
the
body
of
a
dead
man
the
latter
therefore
comes
to
life
as
the
former
dies
but
the
friends
of
the
sleeper
in
turn
engage
a
wizard
to
steal
the
soul
of
another
sleeper
who
dies
as
the
first
sleeper
comes
to
life
in
this
way
an
indefinite
succession
of
deaths
and
resurrections
is
supposed
to
take
place
nowhere
perhaps
is
the
art
of
abducting
human
souls
more
carefully
cultivated
or
carried
to
higher
perfection
than
in
the
malay
peninsula
here
the
methods
by
which
the
wizard
works
his
will
are
various
and
so
too
are
his
motives
sometimes
he
desires
to
destroy
an
enemy
sometimes
to
win
the
love
of
a
cold
or
bashful
beauty
some
of
the
charms
operate
entirely
without
contact
in
others
the
receptacle
into
which
the
soul
is
to
be
lured
has
formed
part
of
or
at
least
touched
the
person
of
the
victim
thus
to
take
an
instance
of
the
latter
sort
of
charm
the
following
are
the
directions
given
for
securing
the
soul
of
one
whom
you
wish
to
render
distraught
take
soil
from
the
middle
of
his
footprint
wrap
it
up
in
pieces
of
red
black
and
yellow
cloth
taking
care
to
keep
the
yellow
outside
and
hang
it
from
the
centre
of
your
mosquito
curtain
with
thread
it
will
then
become
your
victim
s
soul
to
complete
the
transubstantiation
however
it
is
needful
to
switch
the
packet
with
a
birch
composed
of
seven
from
a
green
do
this
seven
times
at
sunset
at
midnight
and
at
sunrise
saying
it
is
not
earth
that
i
switch
but
the
heart
of
then
bury
it
in
the
middle
of
a
path
where
your
victim
is
sure
to
step
over
it
and
he
will
unquestionably
become
distraught
another
way
is
to
scrape
the
wood
of
the
floor
where
your
intended
victim
has
been
sitting
mix
the
scrapings
with
earth
from
his
or
her
footprint
and
knead
the
whole
with
wax
from
a
deserted
bees
comb
into
a
likeness
of
him
or
her
then
fumigate
the
figure
with
incense
and
beckon
to
the
soul
every
night
for
three
nights
successively
by
waving
a
cloth
while
you
recite
the
appropriate
spell
in
the
following
cases
the
charm
takes
effect
without
any
contact
whatever
whether
direct
or
indirect
with
the
victim
when
the
moon
just
risen
looks
red
above
the
eastern
horizon
go
out
and
standing
in
the
moonlight
with
the
big
toe
of
your
right
foot
on
the
big
toe
of
your
left
make
a
of
your
right
hand
and
recite
through
it
the
following
words
i
loose
my
shaft
i
loose
it
and
the
moon
clouds
over
loose
it
and
the
sun
is
loose
it
and
the
stars
burn
it
is
not
the
sun
moon
and
stars
that
i
shoot
at
is
the
stalk
of
the
heart
of
that
child
of
the
congregation
cluck
soul
of
come
and
walk
with
me
and
sit
with
me
and
sleep
and
share
my
cluck
repeat
this
thrice
and
after
every
repetition
blow
through
your
hollow
fist
or
you
may
catch
the
soul
in
your
turban
thus
go
out
on
the
night
of
the
full
moon
and
the

but
the
soul
of
perhaps
the
magical
ceremonies
just
described
may
help
to
explain
a
curious
rite
of
immemorial
antiquity
which
was
performed
on
a
very
solemn
occasion
at
athens
on
the
eve
of
the
sailing
of
the
fleet
for
syracuse
when
all
hearts
beat
high
with
hope
and
visions
of
empire
dazzled
all
eyes
consternation
suddenly
fell
on
the
people
one
may
morning
when
they
rose
and
found
that
most
of
the
images
of
hermes
in
the
city
had
been
mysteriously
mutilated
in
the
night
the
impious
perpetrators
of
the
sacrilege
were
unknown
but
whoever
they
were
the
priests
and
priestesses
solemnly
cursed
them
according
to
the
ancient
ritual
standing
with
their
faces
to
the
west
and
shaking
red
cloths
up
and
down
perhaps
in
these
cloths
they
were
catching
the
souls
of
those
at
whom
their
curses
were
levelled
just
as
we
have
seen
that
fijian
chiefs
used
to
catch
the
souls
of
criminals
in
scarves
and
nail
them
to
canoes
the
indians
of
the
nass
river
in
british
columbia
are
impressed
with
a
belief
that
a
physician
may
swallow
his
patient
s
soul
by
mistake
a
doctor
who
is
believed
to
have
done
so
is
made
by
the
other
members
of
the
faculty
to
stand
over
the
patient
while
one
of
them
thrusts
his
fingers
down
the
doctor
s
throat
another
kneads
him
in
the
stomach
with
his
knuckles
and
a
third
slaps
him
on
the
back
if
the
soul
is
not
in
him
after
all
and
if
the
same
process
has
been
repeated
upon
all
the
medical
men
without
success
it
is
concluded
that
the
soul
must
be
in
the
s
box
a
party
of
doctors
therefore
waits
upon
him
at
his
house
and
requests
him
to
produce
his
box
when
he
has
done
so
and
arranged
its
contents
on
a
new
mat
they
take
the
votary
of
aesculapius
and
hold
him
up
by
the
heels
with
his
head
in
a
hole
in
the
floor
in
this
position
they
wash
his
head
and
any
water
remaining
from
the
ablution
is
taken
and
poured
upon
the
sick
man
s
among
the
kwakiutl
indians
of
british
columbia
it
is
forbidden
to
pass
behind
the
back
of
a
shaman
while
he
is
eating
lest
the
shaman
should
inadvertently
swallow
the
soul
of
the
when
that
happens
both
the
shaman
and
the
person
whose
soul
he
has
swallowed
fall
down
in
a
swoon
blood
flows
from
the
shaman
s
mouth
because
the
soul
is
too
large
for
him
and
is
tearing
his
inside
then
the
clan
of
the
person
whose
soul
is
doing
this
mischief
must
assemble
and
sing
the
song
of
the
shaman
in
time
the
suffering
sorcerer
vomits
out
the
soul
which
he
exhibits
in
the
shape
of
a
small
bloody
ball
in
the
open
palms
of
his
hands
he
restores
it
to
its
owner
who
is
lying
prostrate
on
a
mat
by
throwing
it
at
him
and
then
blowing
on
his
head
the
man
whose
soul
was
swallowed
has
very
naturally
to
pay
for
the
damage
he
did
to
the
shaman
as
well
as
for
his
own
cure
the
soul
as
a
shadow
and
a
reflection
but
the
spiritual
dangers
i
have
enumerated
are
not
the
only
ones
which
beset
the
savage
often
he
regards
his
shadow
or
reflection
as
his
soul
or
at
all
events
as
a
vital
part
of
himself
and
as
such
it
is
necessarily
a
source
of
danger
to
him
for
if
it
is
trampled
upon
struck
or
stabbed
he
will
feel
the
injury
as
if
it
were
done
to
his
person
and
if
it
is
detached
from
him
entirely
as
he
believes
that
it
may
be
he
will
die
in
the
island
of
wetar
there
are
magicians
who
can
make
a
man
ill
by
stabbing
his
shadow
with
a
pike
or
hacking
it
with
a
sword
after
sankara
had
destroyed
the
buddhists
in
india
it
is
said
that
he
journeyed
to
nepaul
where
he
had
some
difference
of
opinion
with
the
grand
lama
to
prove
his
supernatural
powers
he
soared
into
the
air
but
as
he
mounted
up
the
grand
lama
perceiving
his
shadow
swaying
and
wavering
on
the
ground
struck
his
knife
into
it
and
down
fell
sankara
and
broke
his
neck
in
the
babar
islands
the
demons
get
power
over
a
man
s
soul
by
holding
fast
his
shadow
or
by
striking
and
wounding
it
among
the
tolindoos
of
central
celebes
to
tread
on
a
man
s
shadow
is
an
offence
because
it
is
supposed
to
make
the
owner
sick
and
for
the
same
reason
the
toboongkoos
of
that
region
forbid
their
children
to
play
with
their
shadows
the
ottawa
indians
thought
they
could
kill
a
man
by
making
certain
figures
on
his
shadow
the
baganda
of
central
africa
regarded
a
man
s
shadow
as
his
ghost
hence
they
used
to
kill
or
injure
their
enemies
by
stabbing
or
treading
on
their
shadows
among
the
bavili
of
west
africa
it
used
to
be
considered
a
crime
to
trample
on
or
even
to
cross
the
shadow
of
another
especially
if
the
shadow
were
that
of
a
married
woman
some
caffres
are
very
unwilling
to
let
anybody
stand
on
their
shadow
believing
that
they
can
be
influenced
for
evil
through
it
they
think
that
a
sick
man
s
shadow
dwindles
in
intensity
when
he
is
about
to
die
for
it
has
such
an
intimate
relation
to
the
man
that
it
suffers
with
the
tribes
of
kavirondo
to
the
east
of
lake
victoria
nyanza
tell
of
the
ancestor
of
all
men
apodtho
by
name
who
descended
to
earth
from
above
bringing
with
him
cattle
fowls
and
seeds
when
he
was
old
the
plotted
to
kill
him
but
for
a
long
time
they
did
not
dare
to
attack
him
at
last
hearing
that
he
was
sick
they
thought
their
chance
had
come
and
sent
a
girl
to
see
how
he
was
she
took
a
small
horn
used
for
cupping
blood
in
her
hand
and
while
she
talked
with
him
she
placed
the
on
his
shadow
to
her
surprise
it
drew
blood
so
she
returned
and
told
her
friends
that
if
they
wished
to
kill
apodtho
they
must
not
touch
his
body
but
spear
his
shadow
they
did
so
and
he
died
and
turned
into
a
rock
which
has
ever
since
possessed
the
property
of
sharpening
spears
unusually
well
in
a
chinese
book
we
read
of
a
sage
who
examined
human
shadows
by
lamplight
in
order
to
discover
the
fate
of
their
owners
a
man
s
shadow
he
said
ought
to
be
deep
for
if
so
he
will
attain
honourable
positions
and
a
great
age
shadows
are
averse
to
being
reflected
in
water
or
in
wells
or
in
it
was
on
such
grounds
that
the
ancients
avoided
shadows
and
that
in
old
days
and
other
vermin
caused
injury
by
hitting
the
shadows
of
men
in
recent
times
there
have
been
men
versed
in
the
art
of
cauterizing
the
shadows
of
their
another
sapient
chinese
writer
observes
i
have
heard
that
if
the
shadow
of
a
bird
is
hit
with
a
piece
of
wood
that
was
struck
by
thunder
the
bird
falls
to
the
ground
immediately
i
never
tried
it
but
on
account
of
the
matter
stated
above
i
consider
the
thing
the
natives
of
nias
tremble
at
the
sight
of
a
rainbow
because
they
think
it
is
a
net
spread
by
a
powerful
spirit
to
catch
their
shadows
in
the
banks
islands
melanesia
there
are
certain
stones
of
a
remarkably
long
shape
which
go
by
the
name
of
or
eating
ghosts
because
certain
powerful
and
dangerous
ghosts
are
believed
to
lodge
in
them
if
a
man
s
shadow
falls
on
one
of
these
stones
the
ghost
will
draw
his
soul
out
from
him
so
that
he
will
die
such
stones
therefore
are
set
in
a
house
to
guard
it
and
a
messenger
sent
to
a
house
by
the
absent
owner
will
call
out
the
name
of
the
sender
lest
the
watchful
ghost
in
the
stone
should
fancy
that
he
came
with
evil
intent
and
should
do
him
a
mischief
in
florida
one
of
the
solomon
islands
there
are
places
sacred
to
ghosts
some
in
the
village
some
in
the
gardens
and
some
in
the
bush
no
man
would
pass
one
of
these
places
when
the
sun
was
so
low
as
to
cast
his
shadow
into
it
for
then
the
ghost
would
draw
it
from
him
the
indian
tribes
of
the
lower
fraser
river
believe
that
man
has
four
souls
of
which
the
shadow
is
one
though
not
the
principal
and
that
sickness
is
caused
by
the
absence
of
one
of
the
souls
hence
no
one
will
let
his
shadow
fall
on
a
sick
shaman
lest
the
latter
should
purloin
it
to
replace
his
own
lost
soul
at
a
funeral
in
china
when
the
lid
is
about
to
be
placed
on
the
coffin
most
of
the
bystanders
with
the
exception
of
the
nearest
kin
retire
a
few
steps
or
even
retreat
to
another
room
for
a
person
s
health
is
believed
to
be
endangered
by
allowing
his
shadow
to
be
enclosed
in
a
coffin
and
when
the
coffin
is
about
to
be
lowered
into
the
grave
most
of
the
spectators
recoil
to
a
little
distance
lest
their
shadows
should
fall
into
the
grave
and
harm
should
thus
be
done
to
their
persons
the
geomancer
and
his
assistants
stand
on
the
side
of
the
grave
which
is
turned
away
from
the
sun
and
the
and
attach
their
shadows
firmly
to
their
persons
by
tying
a
strip
of
cloth
tightly
round
their
waists
in
the
nicobar
islands
burial
usually
takes
place
at
sundown
before
midnight
or
at
early
dawn
in
no
case
can
an
interment
be
carried
out
at
noon
or
within
an
hour
of
it
lest
the
shadows
of
the
bearers
who
lower
the
body
into
the
earth
or
of
the
mourners
taking
their
last
look
at
the
shrouded
figure
should
fall
into
the
grave
for
that
would
cause
them
to
be
sick
or
die
and
when
the
dead
has
been
laid
in
his
last
home
but
before
the
earth
is
shovelled
in
upon
him
the
leaves
of
a
certain
jungle
tree
are
waved
over
the
grave
and
a
lighted
torch
is
brandished
inside
it
to
disperse
any
souls
of
the
sorrowing
bystanders
that
may
be
lingering
with
their
departed
friend
in
his
narrow
bed
then
the
signal
is
given
and
the
earth
or
sand
is
rapidly
shovelled
in
by
a
party
of
young
men
who
have
been
standing
in
readiness
to
perform
the
duty
when
the
malays
are
building
a
house
and
the
central
post
is
being
set
up
the
greatest
precautions
are
taken
to
prevent
the
shadow
of
any
of
the
workers
from
falling
either
on
the
post
or
on
the
hole
dug
to
receive
it
for
otherwise
they
think
that
sickness
and
trouble
will
be
sure
to
follow
when
members
of
some
victorian
tribes
were
performing
magical
ceremonies
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
disease
and
misfortune
on
their
enemies
they
took
care
not
to
let
their
shadows
fall
on
the
object
by
which
the
evil
influence
was
supposed
to
be
wafted
to
the
foe
in
darfur
people
think
that
they
can
do
an
enemy
to
death
by
burying
a
certain
root
in
the
earth
on
the
spot
where
the
shadow
of
his
head
happens
to
fall
the
man
whose
shadow
is
thus
tampered
with
loses
consciousness
at
once
and
will
die
if
the
proper
antidote
be
not
administered
in
like
manner
they
can
paralyse
any
limb
as
a
hand
or
leg
by
planting
a
particular
root
in
the
earth
in
the
shadow
of
the
limb
they
desire
to
maim
nor
is
it
human
beings
alone
who
are
thus
liable
to
be
injured
by
means
of
their
shadows
animals
are
to
some
extent
in
the
same
predicament
a
small
snail
which
frequents
the
neighbourhood
of
the
limestone
hills
in
perak
is
believed
to
suck
the
blood
of
cattle
through
their
shadows
hence
the
beasts
grow
lean
and
sometimes
die
from
loss
of
blood
the
ancients
supposed
that
in
arabia
if
a
hyæna
trod
on
a
man
s
shadow
it
deprived
him
of
the
power
of
speech
and
motion
and
that
if
a
dog
standing
on
a
roof
in
the
moonlight
cast
a
shadow
on
the
ground
and
a
hyæna
trod
on
it
the
dog
would
fall
down
as
if
dragged
with
a
rope
clearly
in
these
cases
the
shadow
if
not
equivalent
to
the
soul
is
at
least
regarded
as
a
living
part
of
the
man
or
the
animal
so
that
injury
done
to
the
shadow
is
felt
by
the
person
or
animal
as
if
it
were
done
to
his
body
even
the
shadows
of
trees
are
supposed
by
the
caffres
to
be
sensitive
hence
when
a
caffre
doctor
seeks
to
pluck
the
leaves
of
a
tree
for
medicinal
purposes
he
takes
care
to
run
up
quickly
and
to
avoid
touching
the
shadow
lest
it
should
inform
the
tree
of
the
danger
and
so
give
the
tree
time
to
withdraw
the
medicinal
properties
from
its
extremities
into
the
safety
of
the
inaccessible
trunk
the
shadow
of
the
tree
is
said
to
feel
the
touch
of
the
man
s
conversely
if
the
shadow
is
a
vital
part
of
a
man
or
an
animal
it
may
under
certain
circumstances
be
as
hazardous
to
be
touched
by
it
as
it
would
be
to
come
into
contact
with
the
person
or
animal
thus
in
the
provinces
of
india
people
believe
that
if
the
shadow
of
the
bird
falls
on
an
ox
or
a
cow
but
especially
on
a
cow
buffalo
the
beast
will
soon
die
the
remedy
is
for
some
one
to
kill
the
bird
rub
his
hands
or
a
stick
in
the
blood
and
then
wave
the
stick
over
the
animal
there
are
certain
men
who
are
noted
for
their
powers
in
this
respect
all
over
the
district
the
kaitish
of
central
australia
hold
that
if
the
shadow
of
a
brown
hawk
falls
on
the
breast
of
a
woman
who
is
suckling
a
child
the
breast
will
swell
up
and
burst
hence
if
a
woman
sees
one
of
these
birds
in
these
circumstances
she
runs
away
in
fear
in
the
central
provinces
of
india
a
pregnant
woman
avoids
the
shadow
of
a
man
believing
that
if
it
fell
on
her
the
child
would
take
after
him
in
features
though
not
in
character
in
shoa
any
obstinate
disorder
for
which
no
remedy
is
known
such
as
insanity
epilepsy
delirium
hysteria
and
vitus
s
dance
is
traced
either
to
possession
by
a
demon
or
to
the
shadow
of
an
enemy
which
has
fallen
on
the
sufferer
the
bushman
is
most
careful
not
to
let
his
shadow
fall
on
the
dead
game
as
he
thinks
this
would
bring
bad
luck
amongst
the
caffres
to
overshadow
the
king
by
standing
in
his
presence
was
an
offence
worthy
of
instant
death
and
it
is
a
caffre
superstition
that
if
the
shadow
of
a
man
who
is
protected
by
a
certain
charm
falls
on
the
shadow
of
a
man
who
is
not
so
protected
the
unprotected
person
will
fall
down
overcome
by
the
power
of
the
charm
which
is
transmitted
through
the
shadow
in
the
punjaub
some
people
believe
that
if
the
shadow
of
a
pregnant
woman
fell
on
a
snake
it
would
blind
the
creature
instantly
hence
the
savage
makes
it
a
rule
to
shun
the
shadow
of
certain
persons
whom
for
various
reasons
he
regards
as
sources
of
dangerous
influence
amongst
the
dangerous
classes
he
commonly
ranks
mourners
and
women
in
general
but
especially
his
the
shuswap
indians
of
british
columbia
think
that
the
shadow
of
a
mourner
falling
upon
a
person
would
make
him
sick
amongst
the
kurnai
tribe
of
victoria
novices
at
initiation
were
cautioned
not
to
let
a
woman
s
shadow
fall
across
them
as
this
would
make
them
thin
lazy
and
stupid
an
australian
native
is
said
to
have
once
nearly
died
of
fright
because
the
shadow
of
his
fell
on
his
legs
as
he
lay
asleep
under
a
tree
the
awe
and
dread
with
which
the
untutored
savage
contemplates
his
are
amongst
the
most
familiar
facts
of
anthropology
in
the
yuin
tribes
of
new
south
wales
the
rule
which
forbade
a
man
to
hold
any
communication
with
his
wife
s
mother
was
very
strict
he
might
not
look
at
her
or
even
in
her
direction
it
was
a
ground
of
divorce
if
his
shadow
happened
to
fall
on
his
in
that
case
he
had
to
leave
his
wife
and
she
returned
to
her
parents
in
the
hunter
river
tribes
of
new
south
wales
it
was
formerly
death
for
a
man
to
speak
to
his
however
in
later
times
the
wretch
who
had
committed
this
heinous
crime
was
suffered
to
live
but
he
was
severely
reprimanded
and
banished
for
a
time
from
the
camp
in
the
kulin
tribe
it
was
thought
that
if
a
woman
looked
at
or
spoke
to
her
or
even
his
brother
her
hair
would
turn
white
the
same
result
it
was
supposed
would
follow
if
she
ate
of
game
which
had
been
presented
to
her
husband
by
her
but
she
could
obviate
this
ill
consequence
by
blackening
her
face
and
especially
her
mouth
with
charcoal
for
then
her
hair
would
not
turn
white
similarly
in
the
kurnai
tribe
of
victoria
a
woman
is
not
permitted
to
see
her
daughter
s
husband
in
camp
or
elsewhere
when
he
is
present
she
keeps
her
head
covered
with
an
opossum
rug
the
camp
of
the
faces
in
a
different
direction
to
that
of
her
a
screen
of
high
bushes
is
erected
between
both
huts
so
that
no
one
can
see
over
from
either
when
the
goes
for
firewood
she
crouches
down
as
she
goes
out
or
in
with
her
head
covered
in
uganda
a
man
may
not
see
his
nor
speak
to
her
face
to
face
should
they
meet
by
accident
she
must
turn
aside
and
cover
her
head
with
her
clothes
or
if
her
garments
are
too
scanty
for
that
she
may
squat
on
her
haunches
and
hide
her
face
in
her
hands
if
he
wishes
to
hold
any
communication
with
her
it
must
be
done
through
a
third
person
or
through
a
wall
or
closed
door
were
he
to
break
these
rules
he
would
certainly
be
seized
with
a
shaking
of
the
hands
and
general
debility
among
some
tribes
of
eastern
africa
which
formerly
acknowledged
the
suzerainty
of
the
sultan
of
zanzibar
before
a
young
couple
had
children
they
might
meet
neither
their
nor
their
to
avoid
them
they
must
take
a
long
roundabout
but
if
they
could
not
do
that
they
must
throw
themselves
on
the
ground
and
hide
their
faces
till
the
or
had
passed
by
among
the
basutos
a
man
may
never
meet
his
wife
s
mother
nor
speak
to
her
nor
see
her
if
his
wife
is
ill
and
her
mother
comes
to
nurse
her
he
must
flee
the
house
so
long
as
she
is
in
it
sentinels
are
posted
to
warn
him
of
her
departure
in
new
britain
the
native
imagination
fails
to
conceive
the
extent
and
nature
of
the
calamities
which
would
result
from
a
man
s
accidentally
speaking
to
his
wife
s
mother
suicide
of
one
or
both
would
probably
be
the
only
course
open
to
them
the
most
solemn
form
of
oath
a
new
briton
can
take
is
sir
if
i
am
not
telling
the
truth
i
hope
i
may
shake
hands
with
my
at
vanua
lava
in
the
banks
islands
a
man
would
not
so
much
as
follow
his
along
the
beach
until
the
rising
tide
had
washed
out
her
footprints
in
the
sand
to
avoid
meeting
his
face
to
face
a
very
desperate
apache
indian
one
of
the
bravest
of
the
brave
has
been
seen
to
clamber
along
the
brink
of
a
precipice
at
the
risk
of
his
life
hanging
on
to
rocks
from
which
had
he
fallen
he
would
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
or
at
least
have
broken
several
of
his
limbs
still
more
curious
and
difficult
to
explain
is
the
rule
which
forbids
certain
african
kings
after
the
coronation
ceremonies
have
been
completed
ever
to
see
their
own
mothers
again
this
restriction
was
imposed
on
the
kings
of
benin
and
uganda
yet
the
lived
in
regal
state
with
a
court
and
lands
of
their
own
in
uganda
it
was
thought
that
if
the
king
were
to
see
his
mother
again
some
evil
and
probably
death
would
surely
befall
him
where
the
shadow
is
regarded
as
so
intimately
bound
up
with
the
life
of
the
man
that
its
loss
entails
debility
or
death
it
is
natural
to
expect
that
its
diminution
should
be
regarded
with
solicitude
and
apprehension
as
betokening
a
corresponding
decrease
in
the
vital
energy
of
its
owner
an
elegant
greek
rhetorician
has
compared
the
man
who
lives
only
for
fame
to
one
who
should
set
all
his
heart
on
his
shadow
puffed
up
and
boastful
when
it
lengthened
sad
and
dejected
when
it
shortened
wasting
and
pining
away
when
it
dwindled
to
nothing
the
spirits
of
such
an
one
he
goes
on
would
necessarily
be
volatile
since
they
must
rise
or
fall
with
every
passing
hour
of
the
day
in
the
morning
when
the
level
sun
just
risen
above
the
eastern
horizon
stretched
out
his
shadow
to
enormous
length
rivalling
the
shadows
cast
by
the
cypresses
and
the
towers
on
the
city
wall
how
blithe
and
exultant
would
he
be
fancying
that
in
stature
he
had
become
a
match
for
the
fabled
giants
of
old
with
what
a
lofty
port
he
would
then
strut
and
shew
himself
in
the
streets
and
the
and
wherever
men
congregated
that
he
might
be
seen
and
admired
of
all
but
as
the
day
wore
on
his
countenance
would
change
and
he
would
slink
back
crestfallen
to
his
house
at
noon
when
his
once
towering
shadow
had
shrunk
to
his
feet
he
would
shut
himself
up
and
refuse
to
stir
abroad
ashamed
to
look
his
in
the
face
but
in
the
afternoon
his
drooping
spirits
would
revive
and
as
the
day
declined
his
joy
and
pride
would
swell
again
with
the
length
of
the
evening
shadows
the
rhetorician
who
thus
sought
to
expose
the
vanity
of
fame
as
an
object
of
human
ambition
by
likening
it
to
an
shadow
little
dreamed
that
in
real
life
there
were
men
who
set
almost
as
much
store
by
their
shadows
as
the
fool
whom
he
had
conjured
up
in
his
imagination
to
point
a
moral
so
hard
is
it
for
the
straining
wings
of
fancy
to
outstrip
the
folly
of
mankind
in
amboyna
and
uliase
two
islands
near
the
equator
where
necessarily
there
is
little
or
no
shadow
cast
at
noon
the
people
make
it
a
rule
not
to
go
out
of
the
house
at
because
they
fancy
that
by
doing
so
a
man
may
lose
the
shadow
of
his
soul
the
mangaians
tell
of
a
mighty
warrior
tukaitawa
whose
strength
waxed
and
waned
with
the
length
of
his
shadow
in
the
morning
when
his
shadow
fell
longest
his
strength
was
greatest
but
as
the
shadow
shortened
towards
noon
his
strength
ebbed
with
it
till
exactly
at
noon
it
reached
its
lowest
point
then
as
the
shadow
stretched
out
in
the
afternoon
his
strength
returned
a
certain
hero
discovered
the
secret
of
tukaitawa
s
strength
and
slew
him
at
noon
the
savage
besisis
of
the
malay
peninsula
fear
to
bury
their
dead
at
noon
because
they
fancy
that
the
shortness
of
their
shadows
at
that
hour
would
sympathetically
shorten
their
own
lives
the
baganda
of
central
africa
used
to
judge
of
a
man
s
health
by
the
length
of
his
shadow
they
said
is
going
to
die
his
shadow
is
very
small
or
he
is
in
good
health
his
shadow
is
similarly
the
caffres
of
south
africa
think
that
a
man
s
shadow
grows
very
small
or
vanishes
at
death
when
her
husband
is
away
at
the
wars
a
woman
hangs
up
his
if
the
shadow
grows
less
she
says
her
husband
is
killed
if
it
remains
unchanged
she
says
he
is
unscathed
it
is
possible
that
even
in
lands
outside
the
tropics
the
observation
of
the
diminished
shadow
at
noon
may
have
contributed
even
if
it
did
not
give
rise
to
the
superstitious
dread
with
which
that
hour
has
been
viewed
by
many
peoples
as
by
the
greeks
ancient
and
modern
the
bretons
the
russians
the
roumanians
of
transylvania
and
the
indians
of
santiago
tepehuacan
in
this
observation
too
we
may
perhaps
detect
the
reason
why
noon
was
chosen
by
the
greeks
as
the
hour
for
sacrificing
to
the
shadowless
dead
the
loss
of
the
shadow
real
or
apparent
has
often
been
regarded
as
a
cause
or
precursor
of
death
whoever
entered
the
sanctuary
of
zeus
on
mount
lycaeus
in
arcadia
was
believed
to
lose
his
shadow
and
to
die
within
the
year
in
lower
austria
on
the
evening
of
sylvester
s
last
day
of
the
company
seated
round
the
table
mark
whose
shadow
is
not
cast
on
the
wall
and
believe
that
the
seemingly
shadowless
person
will
die
next
year
similar
presages
are
drawn
in
germany
both
on
sylvester
s
day
and
on
christmas
eve
the
galelareese
fancy
that
if
a
child
resembles
his
father
they
will
not
both
live
long
for
the
child
has
taken
away
his
father
s
likeness
or
shadow
and
consequently
the
father
must
soon
die
similarly
among
some
tribes
of
the
lower
congo
if
the
child
is
like
its
mother
father
or
uncle
they
think
it
has
the
spirit
of
the
person
it
resembles
and
that
that
person
will
soon
die
hence
a
parent
will
resent
it
if
you
say
that
the
baby
is
like
him
or
nowhere
perhaps
does
the
equivalence
of
the
shadow
to
the
life
or
soul
come
out
more
clearly
than
in
some
customs
practised
to
this
day
in
europe
in
modern
greece
when
the
foundation
of
a
new
building
is
being
laid
it
is
the
custom
to
kill
a
cock
a
ram
or
a
lamb
and
to
let
its
blood
flow
on
the
under
which
the
animal
is
afterwards
buried
the
object
of
the
sacrifice
is
to
give
strength
and
stability
to
the
building
but
sometimes
instead
of
killing
an
animal
the
builder
entices
a
man
to
the
secretly
measures
his
body
or
a
part
of
it
or
his
shadow
and
buries
the
measure
under
the
or
he
lays
the
upon
the
man
s
shadow
it
is
believed
that
the
man
will
die
within
the
year
in
the
island
of
lesbos
it
is
deemed
enough
if
the
builder
merely
casts
a
stone
at
the
shadow
of
a
the
man
whose
shadow
is
thus
struck
will
die
but
the
building
will
be
solid
a
bulgarian
mason
measures
the
shadow
of
a
man
with
a
string
places
the
string
in
a
box
and
then
builds
the
box
into
the
wall
of
the
edifice
within
forty
days
thereafter
the
man
whose
shadow
was
measured
will
be
dead
and
his
soul
will
be
in
the
box
beside
the
string
but
often
it
will
come
forth
and
appear
in
its
former
shape
to
persons
who
were
born
on
a
saturday
if
a
bulgarian
builder
can
not
obtain
a
human
shadow
for
this
purpose
he
will
content
himself
with
measuring
the
shadow
of
the
first
animal
that
comes
that
way
the
roumanians
of
transylvania
think
that
he
whose
shadow
is
thus
immured
will
die
within
forty
days
so
persons
passing
by
a
building
which
is
in
course
of
erection
may
hear
a
warning
cry
beware
lest
they
take
thy
shadow
not
long
ago
there
were
still
whose
business
it
was
to
provide
architects
with
the
shadows
necessary
for
securing
their
walls
in
these
cases
the
measure
of
the
shadow
is
looked
on
as
equivalent
to
the
shadow
itself
and
to
bury
it
is
to
bury
the
life
or
soul
of
the
man
who
deprived
of
it
must
die
thus
the
custom
is
a
substitute
for
the
old
practice
of
immuring
a
living
person
in
the
walls
or
crushing
him
under
the
of
a
new
building
in
order
to
give
strength
and
durability
to
the
structure
or
more
definitely
in
order
that
the
angry
ghost
may
haunt
the
place
and
guard
it
against
the
intrusion
of
enemies
thus
when
a
new
gate
was
made
or
an
old
gate
was
repaired
in
the
walls
of
bangkok
it
used
to
be
customary
to
crush
three
men
to
death
under
an
enormous
beam
in
a
pit
at
the
gateway
before
they
were
led
to
their
doom
they
were
regaled
at
a
splendid
banquet
the
whole
court
came
to
salute
them
and
the
king
himself
charged
them
straitly
to
guard
well
the
gate
that
was
to
be
committed
to
their
care
and
to
warn
him
if
enemies
or
rebels
came
to
assault
the
city
the
next
moment
the
ropes
were
cut
and
the
beam
descended
on
them
the
siamese
believed
that
these
unfortunates
were
transformed
into
the
genii
which
they
called
it
is
said
that
when
the
massive
teak
posts
of
the
gateways
of
mandalay
were
set
up
a
man
was
bound
and
placed
under
each
post
and
crushed
to
death
the
burmese
believe
that
men
who
die
a
violent
death
turn
into
or
demons
and
haunt
the
spot
where
they
were
killed
doing
a
mischief
to
such
as
attempt
to
molest
the
place
thus
their
spirits
become
guardians
of
the
gates
this
theory
would
explain
why
such
sacrifices
appear
to
be
offered
most
commonly
at
thoroughfares
such
as
gates
and
bridges
where
ghostly
warders
may
be
deemed
especially
serviceable
in
keeping
watch
on
the
multitudes
that
go
to
and
fro
in
bima
a
district
of
the
east
indian
island
of
sambawa
the
custom
is
marked
by
some
peculiar
features
which
deserve
to
be
mentioned
when
a
new
is
set
up
at
the
sultan
s
palace
a
woman
is
crushed
to
death
under
it
but
she
must
be
pregnant
if
the
destined
victim
should
be
brought
to
bed
before
her
execution
she
goes
free
the
notion
may
be
that
the
ghost
of
such
a
woman
would
be
more
than
usually
fierce
and
vigilant
again
when
the
wooden
doors
are
set
up
at
the
palace
it
is
customary
to
bury
a
child
under
each
of
the
for
these
purposes
officers
are
sent
to
scour
the
country
for
a
pregnant
woman
or
little
children
as
the
case
may
be
and
if
they
come
back
they
must
give
up
their
own
wives
or
children
to
serve
as
victims
when
the
gates
are
set
up
the
children
are
killed
their
bodies
stript
of
flesh
and
their
bones
laid
in
the
holes
in
which
the
are
erected
then
the
flesh
is
boiled
with
horse
s
flesh
and
served
up
to
the
officers
any
officer
who
refuses
to
eat
of
it
is
at
once
cut
down
the
intention
of
this
last
practice
is
perhaps
to
secure
the
fidelity
of
the
officers
by
compelling
them
to
enter
into
a
covenant
of
the
most
solemn
and
binding
nature
with
the
ghosts
of
the
murdered
children
who
are

guard

gates
the
practice
of
burying
the
measure
of
a
man
s
shadow
as
a
substitute
for
the
man
himself
under
the
of
a
building
may
perhaps
throw
light
on
the
singular
deity
whom
the
people
of
kisser
an
east
indian
island
choose
to
guard
their
houses
and
villages
the
god
in
question
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
which
was
used
to
measure
the
foundations
of
the
house
or
of
the
village
temple
after
it
has
served
this
useful
purpose
the
tape
is
wound
about
a
stick
shaped
like
a
paddle
and
is
then
deposited
in
the
thatch
of
the
roof
of
the
house
where
food
is
offered
to
it
on
all
special
occasions
the
deified
of
the
whole
village
is
that
which
was
used
to
measure
the
foundations
of
the
first
house
or
of
the
village
temple
the
handle
of
the
stick
on
which
it
is
wound
is
carved
into
the
figure
of
a
person
squatting
in
the
usual
posture
and
the
whole
is
kept
in
a
rough
wooden
box
along
with
one
or
two
figures
to
act
as
its
guards
it
is
possible
though
perhaps
hardly
probable
that
these
tapes
may
be
thought
to
contain
the
souls
of
men
whose
shadows
they
measured
at
the
foundation
ceremony
as
some
peoples
believe
a
man
s
soul
to
be
in
his
shadow
so
other
or
the
same
peoples
believe
it
to
be
in
his
reflection
in
water
or
a
mirror
thus
the
andamanese
do
not
regard
their
shadows
but
their
reflections
in
any
mirror
as
their
according
to
one
account
some
of
the
fijians
thought
that
man
has
two
souls
a
light
one
and
a
dark
one
the
dark
one
goes
to
hades
the
light
one
is
his
reflection
in
water
or
a
mirror
when
the
motumotu
of
new
guinea
first
saw
their
likenesses
in
a
they
thought
that
their
reflections
were
their
souls
in
new
caledonia
the
old
men
are
of
opinion
that
a
person
s
reflection
in
water
or
a
mirror
is
his
soul
but
the
younger
men
taught
by
the
catholic
priests
maintain
that
it
is
a
reflection
and
nothing
more
just
like
the
reflection
of
in
the
water
the
being
external
to
the
man
is
exposed
to
much
the
same
dangers
as
the
among
the
galelareese
lads
and
girls
may
not
look
at
themselves
in
a
mirror
for
they
say
that
the
mirror
takes
away
their
bloom
and
leaves
them
ugly
and
as
the
shadow
may
be
stabbed
so
may
the
reflection
hence
an
aztec
mode
of
keeping
sorcerers
from
the
house
was
to
leave
a
vessel
of
water
with
a
knife
in
it
behind
the
door
when
a
sorcerer
entered
he
was
so
much
alarmed
at
seeing
his
reflection
in
the
water
transfixed
by
a
knife
that
he
turned
and
fled
in
corrèze
a
district
of
the
auvergne
a
cow
s
milk
had
dried
up
through
the
maleficent
spells
of
a
neighbouring
witch
so
a
sorcerer
was
called
in
to
help
he
made
the
woman
whose
cow
was
bewitched
sit
in
front
of
a
pail
of
water
with
a
knife
in
her
hand
till
she
thought
she
saw
the
image
of
the
witch
in
the
water
whereupon
he
made
her
stab
the
image
with
the
knife
they
say
that
if
the
knife
strikes
the
image
fair
in
the
eye
the
person
whose
likeness
it
is
will
suffer
a
corresponding
injury
in
his
or
her
eye
this
procedure
we
are
informed
has
been
successful
in
restoring
milk
to
the
udders
of
a
cow
when
even
holy
water
had
been
tried
in
vain
the
zulus
will
not
look
into
a
dark
pool
because
they
think
there
is
a
beast
in
it
which
will
take
away
their
reflections
so
that
they
die
the
basutos
say
that
crocodiles
have
the
power
of
thus
killing
a
man
by
dragging
his
reflection
under
water
when
one
of
them
dies
suddenly
and
from
no
apparent
cause
his
relatives
will
allege
that
a
crocodile
must
have
taken
his
shadow
some
time
when
he
crossed
a
stream
in
saddle
island
melanesia
there
is
a
pool
into
which
if
any
one
looks
he
dies
the
malignant
spirit
takes
hold
upon
his
life
by
means
of
his
reflection
on
the
we
can
now
understand
why
it
was
a
maxim
both
in
ancient
india
and
ancient
greece
not
to
look
at
one
s
reflection
in
water
and
why
the
greeks
regarded
it
as
an
omen
of
death
if
a
man
dreamed
of
seeing
himself
so
reflected
they
feared
that
the
would
drag
the
person
s
reflection
or
soul
under
water
leaving
him
soulless
to
perish
this
was
probably
the
origin
of
the
classical
story
of
the
beautiful
narcissus
who
languished
and
died
through
seeing
his
reflection
in
the
water
the
explanation
that
he
died
for
love
of
his
own
fair
image
was
probably
devised
later
after
the
old
meaning
of
the
story
was
forgotten
the
same
ancient
belief
lingers
in
a
faded
form
in
the
english
superstition
that
whoever
sees
a
water
fairy
must
pine
and
die
the
moon
should
ever
show
what
man
should
never
see
saw
a
maiden
on
a
stream
fair
was
she
staid
to
watch
a
little
space
parted
lips
if
she
would
sing
waters
closed
above
her
many
a
know
my
life
will
fade
away
know
that
i
must
vainly
pine
i
am
made
of
mortal
clay
she
s
divine
further
we
can
now
explain
the
widespread
custom
of
covering
up
mirrors
or
turning
them
to
the
wall
after
a
death
has
taken
place
in
the
house
it
is
feared
that
the
soul
projected
out
of
the
person
in
the
shape
of
his
reflection
in
the
mirror
may
be
carried
off
by
the
ghost
of
the
departed
which
is
commonly
supposed
to
linger
about
the
house
till
the
burial
the
custom
is
thus
exactly
parallel
to
the
aru
custom
of
not
sleeping
in
a
house
after
a
death
for
fear
that
the
soul
projected
out
of
the
body
in
a
dream
may
meet
the
ghost
and
be
carried
off
by
it
in
oldenburg
it
is
thought
that
if
a
person
sees
his
image
in
a
mirror
after
a
death
he
will
die
himself
so
all
the
mirrors
in
the
house
are
covered
up
with
white
cloth
in
some
parts
of
germany
and
belgium
after
a
death
not
only
the
mirrors
but
everything
that
shines
or
glitters
windows
clocks
etc
is
covered
up
doubtless
because
they
might
reflect
a
person
s
image
the
same
custom
of
covering
up
mirrors
or
turning
them
to
the
wall
after
a
death
prevails
in
england
scotland
madagascar
and
among
the
karaits
a
jewish
sect
in
the
crimea
the
suni
mohammedans
of
bombay
cover
with
a
cloth
the
mirror
in
the
room
of
a
dying
man
and
do
not
remove
it
until
the
corpse
is
carried
out
for
burial
they
also
cover
the
in
their
bedrooms
before
retiring
to
rest
at
night
the
reason
why
sick
people
should
not
see
themselves
in
a
mirror
and
why
the
mirror
in
a
is
therefore
covered
up
is
also
plain
in
time
of
sickness
when
the
soul
might
take
flight
so
easily
it
is
particularly
dangerous
to
project
it
out
of
the
body
by
means
of
the
reflection
in
a
mirror
the
rule
is
therefore
precisely
parallel
to
the
rule
observed
by
some
peoples
of
not
allowing
sick
people
to
sleep
for
in
sleep
the
soul
is
projected
out
of
the
body
and
there
is
always
a
risk
that
it
may
not
return
in
the
opinion
of
the
raskolniks
a
mirror
is
an
accursed
thing
invented
by
the
devil
perhaps
on
account
of
the
mirror
s
supposed
power
of
drawing
out
the
soul
in
the
reflection
and
so
facilitating
its
capture
as
with
shadows
and
reflections
so
with
portraits
they
are
often
believed
to
contain
the
soul
of
the
person
portrayed
people
who
hold
this
belief
are
naturally
loth
to
have
their
likenesses
taken
for
if
the
portrait
is
the
soul
or
at
least
a
vital
part
of
the
person
portrayed
whoever
possesses
the
portrait
will
be
able
to
exercise
a
fatal
influence
over
the
original
of
it
thus
the
esquimaux
of
bering
strait
believe
that
persons
dealing
in
witchcraft
have
the
power
of
stealing
a
person
s
or
shade
so
that
without
it
he
will
pine
away
and
die
once
at
a
village
on
the
lower
yukon
river
an
explorer
had
set
up
his
camera
to
get
a
picture
of
the
people
as
they
were
moving
about
among
their
houses
while
he
was
focusing
the
instrument
the
headman
of
the
village
came
up
and
insisted
on
peeping
under
the
cloth
being
allowed
to
do
so
he
gazed
intently
for
a
minute
at
the
moving
figures
on
the
ground
glass
then
suddenly
withdrew
his
head
and
bawled
at
the
top
of
his
voice
to
the
people
he
has
all
of
your
shades
in
this
a
panic
ensued
among
the
group
and
in
an
instant
they
disappeared
into
their
houses
the
dacotas
hold
that
every
man
has
several
or
apparitions
of
which
after
death
one
remains
at
the
grave
while
another
goes
to
the
place
of
the
departed
for
many
years
no
yankton
dacota
would
consent
to
have
his
picture
taken
lest
one
of
his
apparitions
should
remain
after
death
in
the
picture
instead
of
going
to
the
an
indian
whose
portrait
the
prince
of
wied
wished
to
get
refused
to
let
himself
be
drawn
because
he
believed
it
would
cause
his
death
the
mandan
indians
also
thought
that
they
would
soon
die
if
their
portraits
were
in
the
hands
of
another
they
wished
at
least
to
have
the
artist
s
picture
as
a
kind
of
hostage
the
tepehuanes
of
mexico
stood
in
mortal
terror
of
the
camera
and
five
days
persuasion
was
necessary
to
induce
them
to
pose
for
it
when
at
last
they
consented
they
looked
like
criminals
about
to
be
executed
they
believed
that
by
photographing
people
the
artist
could
carry
off
their
souls
and
devour
them
at
his
leisure
moments
they
said
that
when
the
pictures
reached
his
country
they
would
die
or
some
other
evil
would
befall
them
the
canelos
indians
of
ecuador
think
that
their
soul
is
carried
away
in
their
picture
two
of
them
who
had
been
photographed
were
so
alarmed
that
they
came
back
next
day
on
purpose
to
ask
if
it
were
really
true
that
their
souls
had
been
taken
away
similar
notions
are
entertained
by
the
aymara
indians
of
peru
and
bolivia
the
araucanians
of
chili
are
unwilling
to
have
their
portraits
drawn
for
they
fancy
that
he
who
has
their
portraits
in
his
possession
could
by
means
of
magic
injure
or
destroy
themselves
the
yaos
a
tribe
of
british
central
africa
in
the
neighbourhood
of
lake
nyassa
believe
that
every
human
being
has
a
a
soul
shade
or
spirit
which
they
appear
to
associate
with
the
shadow
or
picture
of
the
person
some
of
them
have
been
known
to
refuse
to
enter
a
room
where
pictures
were
hung
on
the
walls
because
of
the
souls
in
the
camera
was
at
first
an
object
of
dread
to
them
and
when
it
was
turned
on
a
group
of
natives
they
scattered
in
all
directions
with
shrieks
of
terror
they
said
that
the
european
was
about
to
take
away
their
shadows
and
that
they
would
die
the
transference
of
the
shadow
or
portrait
for
the
yao
word
for
the
two
is
the
same
to
wit
to
the
photographic
plate
would
involve
the
disease
or
death
of
the
shadeless
body
a
yao
chief
after
much
difficulty
allowed
himself
to
be
photographed
on
condition
that
the
picture
should
be
shewn
to
none
of
his
subjects
but
sent
out
of
the
country
as
soon
as
possible
he
feared
lest
some
might
use
it
to
bewitch
him
some
time
afterwards
he
fell
ill
and
his
attendants
attributed
the
illness
to
some
accident
which
had
befallen
the
photographic
plate
in
england
the
ngoni
of
the
same
region
entertain
a
similar
belief
and
formerly
exhibited
a
similar
dread
of
sitting
to
a
photographer
lest
by
so
doing
they
should
yield
up
their
shades
or
spirits
to
him
and
they
should
die
when
joseph
thomson
attempted
to
photograph
some
of
the
in
eastern
africa
they
imagined
that
he
was
a
magician
trying
to
obtain
possession
of
their
souls
and
that
if
he
got
their
likenesses
they
themselves
would
be
entirely
at
his
mercy
when
catat
and
some
companions
were
exploring
the
bara
country
on
the
west
coast
of
madagascar
the
people
suddenly
became
hostile
the
day
before
the
travellers
not
without
difficulty
had
photographed
the
royal
family
and
now
found
themselves
accused
of
taking
the
souls
of
the
natives
for
the
purpose
of
selling
them
when
they
returned
to
france
denial
was
vain
in
compliance
with
the
custom
of
the
country
they
were
obliged
to
catch
the
souls
which
were
then
put
into
a
basket
and
ordered
by
catat
to
return
to
their
respective
owners
some
villagers
in
sikhim
betrayed
a
lively
horror
and
hid
away
whenever
the
lens
of
a
camera
or
the
evil
eye
of
the
box
as
they
called
it
was
turned
on
them
they
thought
it
took
away
their
souls
with
their
pictures
and
so
put
it
in
the
power
of
the
owner
of
the
pictures
to
cast
spells
on
them
and
they
alleged
that
a
photograph
of
the
scenery
blighted
the
landscape
until
the
reign
of
the
late
king
of
siam
no
siamese
coins
were
ever
stamped
with
the
image
of
the
king
for
at
that
time
there
was
a
strong
prejudice
against
the
making
of
portraits
in
any
medium
europeans
who
travel
into
the
jungle
have
even
at
the
present
time
only
to
point
a
camera
at
a
crowd
to
procure
its
instant
dispersion
when
a
copy
of
the
face
of
a
person
is
made
and
taken
away
from
him
a
portion
of
his
life
goes
with
the
picture
unless
the
sovereign
had
been
blessed
with
the
years
of
a
methusaleh
he
could
scarcely
have
permitted
his
life
to
be
distributed
in
small
pieces
together
with
the
coins
of
the
similarly
in
corea
the
effigy
of
the
king
is
not
struck
on
the
coins
only
a
few
chinese
characters
are
put
on
them
they
would
deem
it
an
insult
to
the
king
to
put
his
sacred
face
on
objects
which
pass
into
the
most
vulgar
hands
and
often
roll
on
the
ground
in
the
dust
or
the
mud
when
the
french
ships
arrived
for
the
first
time
in
corea
the
mandarin
who
was
sent
on
board
to
communicate
with
them
was
dreadfully
shocked
to
see
the
levity
with
which
these
western
barbarians
treated
the
face
of
their
sovereign
reproduced
on
the
coins
and
the
recklessness
with
which
they
put
it
in
the
hands
of
the
first
comer
without
troubling
themselves
in
the
least
whether
or
not
he
would
shew
it
due
in
minahassa
a
district
of
celebes
many
chiefs
are
reluctant
to
be
photographed
believing
that
if
that
were
done
they
would
soon
die
for
they
imagine
that
were
the
photograph
lost
by
its
owner
and
found
by
somebody
else
whatever
injury
the
finder
chose
to
do
to
the
portrait
would
equally
affect
the
person
whom
it
represented
mortal
terror
was
depicted
on
the
faces
of
the
battas
upon
whom
von
brenner
turned
the
lens
of
his
camera
they
thought
he
wished
to
carry
off
their
shadows
or
spirits
in
a
little
box
when
nieuwenhuis
attempted
to
photograph
the
kayans
or
bahaus
of
central
borneo
they
were
much
alarmed
fearing
that
their
souls
would
follow
their
photographs
into
the
far
country
and
that
their
deserted
bodies
would
fall
sick
further
they
imagined
that
possessing
their
likenesses
the
explorer
would
be
able
by
magic
art
to
work
on
the
originals
at
a
distance
beliefs
of
the
same
sort
still
linger
in
various
parts
of
europe
not
very
many
years
ago
some
old
women
in
the
greek
island
of
carpathus
were
very
angry
at
having
their
likenesses
drawn
thinking
that
in
consequence
they
would
pine
and
die

tabooed
acts
taboos
on
intercourse
with
strangers
so
much
for
the
primitive
conceptions
of
the
soul
and
the
dangers
to
which
it
is
exposed
these
conceptions
are
not
limited
to
one
people
or
country
with
variations
of
detail
they
are
found
all
over
the
world
and
survive
as
we
have
seen
in
modern
europe
beliefs
so
and
so
widespread
must
necessarily
have
contributed
to
shape
the
mould
in
which
the
early
kingship
was
cast
for
if
every
person
was
at
such
pains
to
save
his
own
soul
from
the
perils
which
threatened
it
on
so
many
sides
how
much
more
carefully
must
have
been
guarded
upon
whose
life
hung
the
welfare
and
even
the
existence
of
the
whole
people
and
whom
therefore
it
was
the
common
interest
of
all
to
preserve
therefore
we
should
expect
to
find
the
king
s
life
protected
by
a
system
of
precautions
or
safeguards
still
more
numerous
and
minute
than
those
which
in
primitive
society
every
man
adopts
for
the
safety
of
his
own
soul
now
in
point
of
fact
the
life
of
the
early
kings
is
regulated
as
we
have
seen
and
shall
see
more
fully
presently
by
a
very
exact
code
of
rules
may
we
not
then
conjecture
that
these
rules
are
in
fact
the
very
safeguards
which
we
should
expect
to
find
adopted
for
the
protection
of
the
king
s
life
an
examination
of
the
rules
themselves
confirms
this
conjecture
for
from
this
it
appears
that
some
of
the
rules
observed
by
the
kings
are
identical
with
those
observed
by
private
persons
out
of
regard
for
the
safety
of
their
souls
and
even
of
those
which
seem
peculiar
to
the
king
many
if
not
all
are
most
readily
explained
on
the
hypothesis
that
they
are
nothing
but
safeguards
or
lifeguards
of
the
king
i
will
now
enumerate
some
of
these
royal
rules
or
taboos
offering
on
each
of
them
such
comments
and
explanations
as
may
serve
to
set
the
original
intention
of
the
rule
in
its
proper
light
as
the
object
of
the
royal
taboos
is
to
isolate
the
king
from
all
sources
of
danger
their
general
effect
is
to
compel
him
to
live
in
a
state
of
seclusion
more
or
less
complete
according
to
the
number
and
stringency
of
the
rules
he
observes
now
of
all
sources
of
danger
none
are
more
dreaded
by
the
savage
than
magic
and
witchcraft
and
he
suspects
all
strangers
of
practising
these
black
arts
to
guard
against
the
baneful
influence
exerted
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
by
strangers
is
therefore
an
elementary
dictate
of
savage
prudence
hence
before
strangers
are
allowed
to
enter
a
district
or
at
least
before
they
are
permitted
to
mingle
freely
with
the
inhabitants
certain
ceremonies
are
often
performed
by
the
natives
of
the
country
for
the
purpose
of
disarming
the
strangers
of
their
magical
powers
of
counteracting
the
baneful
influence
which
is
believed
to
emanate
from
them
or
of
disinfecting
so
to
speak
the
tainted
atmosphere
by
which
they
are
supposed
to
be
surrounded
thus
when
the
ambassadors
sent
by
justin
emperor
of
the
east
to
conclude
a
peace
with
the
turks
had
reached
their
destination
they
were
received
by
shamans
who
subjected
them
to
a
ceremonial
purification
for
the
purpose
of
exorcising
all
harmful
influence
having
deposited
the
goods
brought
by
the
ambassadors
in
an
open
place
these
wizards
carried
burning
branches
of
incense
round
them
while
they
rang
a
bell
and
beat
on
a
tambourine
snorting
and
falling
into
a
state
of
frenzy
in
their
efforts
to
dispel
the
powers
of
evil
afterwards
they
purified
the
ambassadors
themselves
by
leading
them
through
the
flames
in
the
island
of
nanumea
south
pacific
strangers
from
ships
or
from
other
islands
were
not
allowed
to
communicate
with
the
people
until
they
all
or
a
few
as
representatives
of
the
rest
had
been
taken
to
each
of
the
four
temples
in
the
island
and
prayers
offered
that
the
god
would
avert
any
disease
or
treachery
which
these
strangers
might
have
brought
with
them
meat
offerings
were
also
laid
upon
the
altars
accompanied
by
songs
and
dances
in
honour
of
the
god
while
these
ceremonies
were
going
on
all
the
people
except
the
priests
and
their
attendants
kept
out
of
sight
on
returning
from
an
attempted
ascent
of
the
great
african
mountain
kilimanjaro
which
is
believed
by
the
neighbouring
tribes
to
be
tenanted
by
dangerous
demons
new
and
his
party
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
border
of
the
inhabited
country
were
disenchanted
by
the
inhabitants
being
sprinkled
with
a
professionally
prepared
liquor
supposed
to
possess
the
potency
of
neutralising
evil
influences
and
removing
the
spell
of
wicked
in
the
interior
of
yoruba
west
africa
the
sentinels
at
the
gates
of
towns
often
oblige
european
travellers
to
wait
till
nightfall
before
they
admit
them
fearing
that
if
the
strangers
were
admitted
by
day
the
devil
would
enter
behind
them
the
whole
mahafaly
country
in
madagascar
used
to
be
tabooed
to
strangers
of
the
white
race
the
natives
imagining
that
the
intrusion
of
a
white
man
would
immediately
cause
the
death
of
their
king
the
traveller
bastard
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
overcoming
the
reluctance
of
the
natives
to
allow
him
to
enter
their
land
and
especially
to
visit
their
holy
city
amongst
the
ot
danoms
of
borneo
it
is
the
custom
that
strangers
entering
the
territory
should
pay
to
the
natives
a
certain
sum
which
is
spent
in
the
sacrifice
of
buffaloes
or
pigs
to
the
spirits
of
the
land
and
water
in
order
to
reconcile
them
to
the
presence
of
the
strangers
and
to
induce
them
not
to
withdraw
their
favour
from
the
people
of
the
country
but
to
bless
the
and
so
forth
the
men
of
a
certain
district
in
borneo
fearing
to
look
upon
a
european
traveller
lest
he
should
make
them
ill
warned
their
wives
and
children
not
to
go
near
him
those
who
could
not
restrain
their
curiosity
killed
fowls
to
appease
the
evil
spirits
and
smeared
themselves
with
the
blood
more
dreaded
says
a
traveller
in
central
borneo
than
the
evil
spirits
of
the
neighbourhood
are
the
evil
spirits
from
a
distance
which
accompany
travellers
when
a
company
from
the
middle
mahakam
river
visited
me
among
the
kayans
in
the
year
no
woman
shewed
herself
outside
her
house
without
a
burning
bundle
of
bark
the
stinking
smoke
of
which
drives
away
evil
in
laos
before
a
stranger
can
be
accorded
hospitality
the
master
of
the
house
must
offer
sacrifice
to
the
ancestral
spirits
otherwise
the
spirits
would
be
offended
and
would
send
disease
on
the
inmates
when
madame
pfeiffer
arrived
at
the
village
of
among
the
battas
of
sumatra
a
buffalo
was
killed
and
the
liver
offered
to
her
then
a
ceremony
was
performed
to
propitiate
the
evil
spirits
two
young
men
danced
and
one
of
them
in
dancing
sprinkled
water
from
a
buffalo
s
horn
on
the
visitor
and
the
spectators
in
the
mentawei
islands
when
a
stranger
enters
a
house
where
there
are
children
the
father
or
other
member
of
the
family
takes
the
ornament
which
the
children
wear
in
their
hair
and
hands
it
to
the
stranger
who
holds
it
in
his
hands
for
a
while
and
then
gives
it
back
to
him
this
is
thought
to
protect
the
children
from
the
evil
effect
which
the
sight
of
a
stranger
might
have
upon
them
when
a
dutch
steamship
was
approaching
their
villages
the
people
of
biak
an
island
off
the
north
coast
of
new
guinea
shook
and
knocked
their
idols
about
in
order
to
ward
off
at
shepherd
s
isle
captain
moresby
had
to
be
disenchanted
before
he
was
allowed
to
land
his
boat
s
crew
when
he
leaped
ashore
a
seized
his
right
hand
and
waved
a
bunch
of
palm
leaves
over
the
captain
s
head
then
he
placed
the
leaves
in
my
left
hand
putting
a
small
green
twig
into
his
mouth
still
holding
me
fast
and
then
as
if
with
great
effort
drew
the
twig
from
his
was
extracting
the
evil
which
he
blew
violently
as
if
to
speed
it
away
i
now
held
a
twig
between
my
teeth
and
he
went
through
the
same
then
the
two
raced
round
a
couple
of
sticks
fixed
in
the
ground
and
bent
to
an
angle
at
the
top
which
had
leaves
tied
to
it
after
some
more
ceremonies
the
concluded
by
leaping
to
the
level
of
captain
moresby
s
shoulders
his
hands
resting
on
the
captain
s
shoulders
several
times
as
if
to
show
that
he
had
conquered
the
devil
and
was
now
trampling
him
into
the
north
american
indians
have
an
idea
that
strangers
particularly
white
strangers
are
ofttimes
accompanied
by
evil
spirits
of
these
they
have
great
dread
as
creating
and
delighting
in
mischief
one
of
the
duties
of
the
medicine
chief
is
to
exorcise
these
spirits
i
have
sometimes
ridden
into
or
through
a
camp
where
i
was
unknown
or
unexpected
to
be
confronted
by
a
tall
savage
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
circle
of
lodges
and
yelling
in
a
nasal
tone
a
string
of
unintelligible
when
crevaux
was
travelling
in
south
america
he
entered
a
village
of
the
apalai
indians
a
few
moments
after
his
arrival
some
of
the
indians
brought
him
a
number
of
large
black
ants
of
a
species
whose
bite
is
painful
fastened
on
palm
leaves
then
all
the
people
of
the
village
without
distinction
of
age
or
sex
presented
themselves
to
him
and
he
had
to
sting
them
all
with
the
ants
on
their
faces
thighs
and
other
parts
of
their
bodies
sometimes
when
he
applied
the
ants
too
tenderly
they
called
out
more
more
and
were
not
satisfied
till
their
skin
was
thickly
studded
with
tiny
swellings
like
what
might
have
been
produced
by
whipping
them
with
nettles
the
object
of
this
ceremony
is
made
plain
by
the
custom
observed
in
amboyna
and
uliase
of
sprinkling
sick
people
with
pungent
spices
such
as
ginger
and
cloves
chewed
fine
in
order
by
the
prickling
sensation
to
drive
away
the
demon
of
disease
which
may
be
clinging
to
their
persons
in
java
a
popular
cure
for
gout
or
rheumatism
is
to
rub
spanish
pepper
into
the
nails
of
the
fingers
and
toes
of
the
sufferer
the
pungency
of
the
pepper
is
supposed
to
be
too
much
for
the
gout
or
rheumatism
who
accordingly
departs
in
haste
so
on
the
slave
coast
of
africa
the
mother
of
a
sick
child
sometimes
believes
that
an
evil
spirit
has
taken
possession
of
the
child
s
body
and
in
order
to
drive
him
out
she
makes
small
cuts
in
the
body
of
the
little
sufferer
and
inserts
green
peppers
or
spices
in
the
wounds
believing
that
she
will
thereby
hurt
the
evil
spirit
and
force
him
to
be
gone
the
poor
child
naturally
screams
with
pain
but
the
mother
hardens
her
heart
in
the
belief
that
the
demon
is
suffering
equally
in
hawaii
a
patient
is
sometimes
pricked
with
bamboo
needles
for
the
sake
of
hurting
and
expelling
a
refractory
demon
who
is
lurking
in
the
sufferer
s
body
and
making
him
dyak
sorceresses
in
borneo
will
sometimes
slash
the
body
of
a
sick
man
with
sharp
knives
in
order
it
is
said
to
allow
the
demon
of
disease
to
escape
through
the
cuts
but
perhaps
the
notion
rather
is
to
make
the
present
quarters
of
the
spirit
too
hot
for
him
with
a
similar
intention
some
of
the
natives
of
borneo
and
celebes
sprinkle
rice
upon
the
head
or
body
of
a
person
supposed
to
be
infested
by
dangerous
spirits
a
fowl
is
then
brought
which
by
picking
up
the
rice
from
the
person
s
head
or
body
removes
along
with
it
the
spirit
or
ghost
which
is
clinging
like
a
burr
to
his
skin
this
is
done
for
example
to
persons
who
have
attended
a
funeral
and
who
may
therefore
be
supposed
to
be
infested
by
the
ghost
of
the
deceased
similarly
basutos
who
have
carried
a
corpse
to
the
grave
have
their
hands
scratched
with
a
knife
from
the
tip
of
the
thumb
to
the
tip
of
the
forefinger
and
magic
stuff
is
rubbed
into
the
wound
for
the
purpose
no
doubt
of
removing
the
ghost
which
may
be
adhering
to
their
skin
among
the
barotse
of
africa
a
few
days
after
a
funeral
the
sorcerer
makes
an
incision
in
the
forehead
of
each
surviving
member
of
the
family
and
fills
it
with
medicine
in
order
to
ward
off
contagion
and
the
effect
of
the
sorcery
which
caused
the
when
in
east
africa
have
killed
an
elephant
they
get
upon
its
carcase
make
little
cuts
in
their
toes
and
rub
gunpowder
into
the
cuts
this
is
done
with
the
double
intention
of
counteracting
any
evil
influence
that
may
emanate
from
the
dead
elephant
and
of
acquiring
thereby
the
fleetness
of
foot
possessed
by
the
animal
in
its
life
the
people
of
nias
carefully
scrub
and
scour
the
weapons
and
clothes
which
they
buy
in
order
to
efface
all
connexion
between
the
things
and
the
persons
from
whom
they
bought
them
it
is
probable
that
the
same
dread
of
strangers
rather
than
any
desire
to
do
them
honour
is
the
motive
of
certain
ceremonies
which
are
sometimes
observed
at
their
reception
but
of
which
the
intention
is
not
directly
stated
in
the
ongtong
java
islands
which
are
inhabited
by
polynesians
and
lie
a
little
to
the
north
of
the
solomon
islands
the
priests
or
sorcerers
seem
to
wield
great
influence
their
main
business
is
to
summon
or
exorcise
spirits
for
the
purpose
of
averting
or
dispelling
sickness
and
of
procuring
favourable
winds
a
good
catch
of
fish
and
so
on
when
strangers
land
on
the
islands
they
are
first
of
all
received
by
the
sorcerers
sprinkled
with
water
anointed
with
oil
and
girt
with
dried
pandanus
leaves
at
the
same
time
sand
and
water
are
freely
thrown
about
in
all
directions
and
the
newcomer
and
his
boat
are
wiped
with
green
leaves
after
this
ceremony
the
strangers
are
introduced
by
the
sorcerers
to
the
chief
in
afghanistan
and
in
some
parts
of

the

before
he
enters

frequently
received
with

of

or
of

and
incense
the

mission
in
passing
by
villages
in

was
often
met
with
fire
and
incense
sometimes
a
tray
of

embers
is
thrown
under
the
hoofs
of
the

custom
compelled
them
to
have
their
feet
washed
sometimes
the
ceremony
was
performed
in
a
sacred
place
amongst
the
esquimaux
of
cumberland
inlet
when
a
stranger
arrives
at
an
encampment
the
sorcerer
goes
out
to
meet
him
the
stranger
folds
his
arms
and
inclines
his
head
to
one
side
so
as
to
expose
his
cheek
upon
which
the
magician
deals
a
terrible
blow
sometimes
felling
him
to
the
ground
next
the
sorcerer
in
his
turn
presents
his
cheek
to
the
smiter
and
receives
a
buffet
from
the
stranger
then
they
kiss
each
other
the
ceremony
is
over
and
the
stranger
is
hospitably
received
by
all
sometimes
the
dread
of
strangers
and
their
magic
is
too
great
to
allow
of
their
reception
on
any
terms
thus
when
speke
arrived
at
a
certain
village
the
natives
shut
their
doors
against
him
because
they
had
never
before
seen
a
white
man
nor
the
tin
boxes
that
the
men
were
carrying
who
knows
they
said
but
that
these
very
boxes
are
the
plundering
watuta
transformed
and
come
to
kill
us
you
can
not
be
no
persuasion
could
avail
with
them
and
the
party
had
to
proceed
to
the
next
the
fear
thus
entertained
of
alien
visitors
is
often
mutual
entering
a
strange
land
the
savage
feels
that
he
is
treading
enchanted
ground
and
he
takes
steps
to
guard
against
the
demons
that
haunt
it
and
the
magical
arts
of
its
inhabitants
thus
on
going
to
a
strange
land
the
maoris
performed
certain
ceremonies
to
make
it
common
lest
it
might
have
been
previously
sacred
when
baron
was
approaching
a
village
on
the
maclay
coast
of
new
guinea
one
of
the
natives
who
accompanied
him
broke
a
branch
from
a
tree
and
going
aside
whispered
to
it
for
a
while
then
stepping
up
to
each
member
of
the
party
one
after
another
he
spat
something
upon
his
back
and
gave
him
some
blows
with
the
branch
lastly
he
went
into
the
forest
and
buried
the
branch
under
withered
leaves
in
the
thickest
part
of
the
jungle
this
ceremony
was
believed
to
protect
the
party
against
all
treachery
and
danger
in
the
village
they
were
approaching
the
idea
probably
was
that
the
malignant
influences
were
drawn
off
from
the
persons
into
the
branch
and
buried
with
it
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
before
stuhlmann
and
his
companions
entered
the
territory
of
the
wanyamwesi
in
central
africa
one
of
his
men
killed
a
white
cock
and
buried
it
in
a
pot
just
at
the
boundary
in
australia
when
a
strange
tribe
has
been
invited
into
a
district
and
is
approaching
the
encampment
of
the
tribe
which
owns
the
land
the
strangers
carry
lighted
bark
or
burning
sticks
in
their
hands
for
the
purpose
they
say
of
clearing
and
purifying
the
on
the
coast
of
victoria
there
is
a
tract
of
country
between
the
la
trobe
river
and
the
yarra
river
which
some
of
the
aborigines
called
the
bad
country
it
was
supposed
to
act
injuriously
on
strangers
hence
when
a
man
of
another
clan
entered
it
he
needed
some
one
of
the
natives
to
look
after
him
and
if
his
guardian
went
away
from
the
camp
he
deputed
another
to
take
his
place
during
his
first
visit
before
he
became
as
it
were
acclimatised
the
visitor
did
nothing
for
himself
as
to
food
or
lodging
he
was
painted
with
a
band
of
white
across
the
face
below
the
eyes
and
had
to
learn
the
nulit
language
before
going
further
he
slept
on
a
thick
layer
of
leaves
so
that
he
should
not
touch
the
ground
and
he
was
fed
with
from
the
point
of
a
burnt
stick
which
he
removed
with
his
teeth
not
with
his
lips
his
was
drawn
from
a
small
hole
in
the
ground
by
his
entertainers
and
they
made
it
muddy
by
stirring
it
with
a
stick
he
might
only
take
three
mouthfuls
at
a
time
each
of
which
he
had
to
let
slowly
trickle
down
his
throat
if
he
did
otherwise
his
throat
would
close
up
the
kayans
and
kenyahs
of
borneo
think
it
well
to
conciliate
the
spirit
of
the
land
when
they
enter
a
strange
country
the
old
men
indeed
trusting
to
the
protection
afforded
by
omens
are
in
little
need
of
further
aid
but
when
young
boys
are
brought
into
a
new
river
of
importance
the
hospitality
of
the
local
demons
is
invoked
the
kayans
make
an
offering
of
fowls
eggs
which
must
not
be
bought
on
the
spot
but
are
carried
from
the
house
sometimes
for
distances
so
long
that
the
devotion
of
the
travellers
is
more
apparent
than
their
presents
to
the
spirits
of
the
land
each
boy
takes
an
egg
and
puts
it
in
a
bamboo
split
at
the
end
into
four
while
one
of
the
older
men
calls
upon
the
hills
rocks
trees
and
streams
to
hear
him
and
to
witness
the
offering
careful
to
disguise
the
true
nature
of
the
gift
he
speaks
of
it
as
a
yam
using
a
form
of
words
fixed
by
usage
omen
bird
he
shouts
into
the
air
we
have
brought
you
these
boys
it
is
on
their
account
only
that
we
have
prepared
this
feast
harm
them
not
make
things
go
pleasantly
and
they
give
you
the
usual
offering
of
a
yam
i
give
this
to
the
the
little
ceremony
is
performed
behind
the
hut
where
the
night
is
spent
and
the
boys
wait
about
for
the
charm
to
take
effect
the
custom
of
the
kenyahs
shows
the
same
feeling
for
the
unknown
and
unseen
spirits
that
are
supposed
to
abound
a
fowl
s
feathers
one
for
each
boy
are
held
by
an
old
man
while
the
youngsters
touch
his
arm
the
invocation
is
quite
a
powerful
example
of
native
rhetoric
smooth
away
trouble
ye
mystic
mountains
hills
valleys
soil
rocks
trees
shield
the
lives
of
the
children
who
have
come
when
the
toradjas
of
central
celebes
are
on
a
expedition
and
have
entered
the
enemy
s
country
they
may
not
eat
any
fruits
which
the
foe
has
planted
nor
any
animal
which
he
has
reared
until
they
have
first
committed
an
act
of
hostility
as
by
burning
a
house
or
killing
a
man
they
think
that
if
they
broke
this
rule
they
would
receive
something
of
the
soul
or
spiritual
essence
of
the
enemy
into
themselves
which
would
destroy
the
mystic
virtue
of
their
talismans
it
is
said
that
just
before
greek
armies
advanced
to
the
shock
of
battle
a
man
bearing
a
lighted
torch
stepped
out
from
either
side
and
threw
his
torch
into
the
space
between
the
hosts
then
they
retired
unmolested
for
they
were
thought
to
be
sacred
to
ares
and
inviolable
now
some
peoples
fancy
that
when
they
advance
to
battle
the
spirits
of
their
fathers
hover
in
the
van
hence
fire
thrown
out
in
front
of
the
line
of
battle
may
be
meant
to
disperse
these
shadowy
combatants
leaving
the
issue
of
the
fight
to
be
determined
by
more
substantial
weapons
than
ghosts
can
wield
similarly
the
fire
which
is
sometimes
borne
at
the
head
of
an
army
is
perhaps
in
some
cases
intended
to
dissipate
the
evil
influences
whether
magical
or
spiritual
with
which
the
air
of
the
enemy
s
country
may
be
conceived
to
teem
again
it
is
thought
that
a
man
who
has
been
on
a
journey
may
have
contracted
some
magic
evil
from
the
strangers
with
whom
he
has
been
brought
into
contact
hence
on
returning
home
before
he
is
readmitted
to
the
society
of
his
tribe
and
friends
he
has
to
undergo
certain
purificatory
ceremonies
thus
the
bechuanas
cleanse
or
purify
themselves
after
journeys
by
shaving
their
heads
lest
they
should
have
contracted
from
strangers
some
evil
by
witchcraft
or
in
some
parts
of
western
africa
when
a
man
returns
home
after
a
long
absence
before
he
is
allowed
to
visit
his
wife
he
must
wash
his
person
with
a
particular
fluid
and
receive
from
the
sorcerer
a
certain
mark
on
his
forehead
in
order
to
counteract
any
magic
spell
which
a
stranger
woman
may
have
cast
on
him
in
his
absence
and
which
might
be
communicated
through
him
to
the
women
of
his
village
every
year
about
of
the
men
of
the
wanyamwesi
tribe
make
journeys
to
the
east
coast
of
africa
either
as
porters
or
as
traffickers
before
he
sets
out
the
husband
smears
his
cheeks
with
a
sort
of
and
during
his
absence
his
wife
may
eat
no
flesh
and
must
keep
for
him
the
sediment
of
the
porridge
in
the
pot
on
their
return
from
the
coast
the
men
sprinkle
meal
every
day
on
all
the
paths
leading
to
the
camp
for
the
purpose
it
is
supposed
of
keeping
evil
spirits
off
and
when
they
reach
their
homes
the
men
again
smear
porridge
on
their
faces
while
the
women
who
have
stayed
at
home
strew
ashes
on
their
heads
in
uganda
when
a
man
returns
from
a
journey
his
wife
takes
some
of
the
bark
cloths
from
the
bed
of
one
of
his
children
and
lays
them
on
her
husband
s
bed
and
as
he
enters
the
house
he
jumps
over
one
of
his
wives
who
has
children
by
him
or
over
one
of
his
children
if
he
neglects
to
do
this
one
of
his
children
or
one
of
his
wives
will
die
when
damaras
return
home
after
a
long
absence
they
are
given
a
small
portion
of
the
fat
of
particular
animals
which
is
supposed
to
possess
certain
virtues
a
story
is
told
of
a
navajo
indian
who
after
long
wanderings
returned
to
his
own
people
when
he
came
within
sight
of
his
house
his
people
made
him
stop
and
told
him
not
to
approach
nearer
till
they
had
summoned
a
shaman
when
the
shaman
was
come
ceremonies
were
performed
over
the
returned
wanderer
and
he
was
washed
from
head
to
foot
and
dried
with
for
thus
do
the
navajo
treat
all
who
return
to
their
homes
from
captivity
with
another
tribe
in
order
that
all
alien
substances
and
influences
may
be
removed
from
them
when
he
had
been
thus
purified
he
entered
the
house
and
his
people
embraced
him
and
wept
over
two
hindoo
ambassadors
who
had
been
sent
to
england
by
a
native
prince
and
had
returned
to
india
were
considered
to
have
so
polluted
themselves
by
contact
with
strangers
that
nothing
but
being
born
again
could
restore
them
to
purity
for
the
purpose
of
regeneration
it
is
directed
to
make
an
image
of
pure
gold
of
the
female
power
of
nature
in
the
shape
either
of
a
woman
or
of
a
cow
in
this
statue
the
person
to
be
regenerated
is
enclosed
and
dragged
through
the
usual
channel
as
a
statue
of
pure
gold
and
of
proper
dimensions
would
be
too
expensive
it
is
sufficient
to
make
an
image
of
the
sacred
through
which
the
person
to
be
regenerated
is
to
such
an
image
of
pure
gold
was
made
at
the
prince
s
command
and
his
ambassadors
were
born
again
by
being
dragged
through
it
in
some
of
the
moluccas
when
a
brother
or
young
returns
from
a
long
journey
a
young
girl
awaits
him
at
the
door
with
a
leaf
in
her
hand
and
water
in
the
leaf
she
throws
the
water
over
his
face
and
bids
him
welcome
among
the
kayans
of
borneo
men
who
have
been
absent
on
a
long
journey
are
secluded
for
four
days
in
a
small
hut
made
specially
for
the
purpose
before
they
are
allowed
to
enter
their
own
house
the
natives
of
savage
island
south
pacific
invariably
killed
not
only
all
strangers
in
distress
who
were
drifted
to
their
shores
but
also
any
of
their
own
people
who
had
gone
away
in
a
ship
and
returned
home
this
was
done
out
of
dread
of
disease
long
after
they
began
to
venture
out
to
ships
they
would
not
immediately
use
the
things
they
obtained
from
them
but
hung
them
up
in
quarantine
for
weeks
in
the
bush
when
precautions
like
these
are
taken
on
behalf
of
the
people
in
general
against
the
malignant
influence
supposed
to
be
exercised
by
strangers
it
is
no
wonder
that
special
measures
are
adopted
to
protect
the
king
from
the
same
insidious
danger
in
the
middle
ages
the
envoys
who
visited
a
tartar
khan
were
obliged
to
pass
between
two
fires
before
they
were
admitted
to
his
presence
and
the
gifts
they
brought
were
also
carried
between
the
fires
the
reason
assigned
for
the
custom
was
that
the
fire
purged
away
any
magic
influence
which
the
strangers
might
mean
to
exercise
over
the
khan
when
subject
chiefs
come
with
their
retinues
to
visit
kalamba
the
most
powerful
chief
of
the
bashilange
in
the
congo
basin
for
the
first
time
or
after
being
rebellious
they
have
to
bathe
men
and
women
together
in
two
brooks
on
two
successive
days
passing
the
nights
under
the
open
sky
in
the
after
the
second
bath
they
proceed
entirely
naked
to
the
house
of
kalamba
who
makes
a
long
white
mark
on
the
breast
and
forehead
of
each
of
them
then
they
return
to
the
and
dress
after
which
they
undergo
the
pepper
ordeal
pepper
is
dropped
into
the
eyes
of
each
of
them
and
while
this
is
being
done
the
sufferer
has
to
make
a
confession
of
all
his
sins
to
answer
all
questions
that
may
be
put
to
him
and
to
take
certain
vows
this
ends
the
ceremony
and
the
strangers
are
now
free
to
take
up
their
quarters
in
the
town
for
as
long
as
they
choose
to
remain
before
strangers
were
admitted
to
the
presence
of
lobengula
king
of
the
matebeles
they
had
to
be
treated
with
a
sticky
green
medicine
which
was
profusely
sprinkled
over
them
by
means
of
a
cow
s
tail
at
kilema
in
eastern
africa
when
a
stranger
arrives
a
medicine
is
made
out
of
a
certain
plant
or
a
tree
fetched
from
a
distance
mixed
with
the
blood
of
a
sheep
or
goat
with
this
mixture
the
stranger
is
besmeared
or
besprinkled
before
he
is
admitted
to
the
presence
of
the
king
the
king
of
monomotapa
in
africa
might
not
wear
any
foreign
stuffs
for
fear
of
their
being
poisoned
the
king
of
cacongo
in
west
africa
might
not
possess
or
even
touch
european
goods
except
metals
arms
and
articles
made
of
wood
and
ivory
persons
wearing
foreign
stuffs
were
very
careful
to
keep
at
a
distance
from
his
person
lest
they
should
touch
him
the
king
of
loango
might
not
look
upon
the
house
of
a
white
man
we
have
already
seen
how
the
native
king
of
fernando
po
dwells
secluded
from
all
contact
with
the
whites
in
the
depths
of
an
extinct
volcano
shunning
the
very
sight
of
a
pale
face
which
in
the
belief
of
his
subjects
would
be
instantly
fatal
to
him
in
a
wild
mountainous
district
of
java
to
the
south
of
bantam
there
exists
a
small
aboriginal
race
who
have
been
described
as
a
living
antiquity
these
are
the
baduwis
who
about
the
year
fled
from
bantam
to
escape
conversion
to
islam
and
in
their
mountain
fastnesses
holding
aloof
from
their
neighbours
still
cleave
to
the
quaint
and
primitive
ways
of
their
heathen
forefathers
their
villages
are
perched
in
spots
which
deep
ravines
lofty
precipices
raging
torrents
and
impenetrable
forests
combine
to
render
almost
inaccessible
their
hereditary
ruler
bears
the
title
of
and
unites
in
his
hands
the
temporal
and
spiritual
power
he
must
never
quit
the
capital
and
none
even
of
his
subjects
who
live
outside
the
town
are
ever
allowed
to
see
him
were
an
alien
to
set
foot
in
his
dwelling
the
place
would
be
desecrated
and
abandoned
in
former
times
the
representatives
of
the
dutch
government
and
the
regent
of
java
once
paid
a
visit
to
the
capital
of
the
baduwis
that
very
night
all
the
people
fled
the
place
and
never
returned
taboos
on
eating
and
drinking
in
the
opinion
of
savages
the
acts
of
eating
and
drinking
are
attended
with
special
danger
for
at
these
times
the
soul
may
escape
from
the
mouth
or
be
extracted
by
the
magic
arts
of
an
enemy
present
among
the
peoples
of
the
slave
coast
the
common
belief
seems
to
be
that
the
indwelling
spirit
leaves
the
body
and
returns
to
it
through
the
mouth
hence
should
it
have
gone
out
it
behoves
a
man
to
be
careful
about
opening
his
mouth
lest
a
homeless
spirit
should
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
and
enter
his
body
this
it
appears
is
considered
most
likely
to
take
place
while
the
man
is
precautions
are
therefore
taken
to
guard
against
these
dangers
thus
of
the
battas
of
sumatra
it
is
said
that
since
the
soul
can
leave
the
body
they
always
take
care
to
prevent
their
soul
from
straying
on
occasions
when
they
have
most
need
of
it
but
it
is
only
possible
to
prevent
the
soul
from
straying
when
one
is
in
the
house
at
feasts
one
may
find
the
whole
house
shut
up
in
order
that
the
soul
may
stay
and
enjoy
the
good
things
set
before
the
zafimanelo
in
madagascar
lock
their
doors
when
they
eat
and
hardly
any
one
ever
sees
them
eating
in
shoa
one
of
the
southern
provinces
of
abyssinia
the
doors
of
the
house
are
scrupulously
barred
at
meals
to
exclude
the
evil
eye
and
a
fire
is
invariably
lighted
else
devils
would
enter
and
there
would
be
no
blessing
on
the
meat
every
time
that
an
abyssinian
of
rank
drinks
a
servant
holds
a
cloth
before
his
master
to
guard
him
from
the
evil
eye
the
warua
will
not
allow
any
one
to
see
them
eating
and
drinking
being
doubly
particular
that
no
person
of
the
opposite
sex
shall
see
them
doing
so
i
had
to
pay
a
man
to
let
me
see
him
drink
i
could
not
make
a
man
let
a
woman
see
him
when
offered
a
drink
of
they
often
ask
that
a
cloth
may
be
held
up
to
hide
them
whilst
drinking
further
every
man
and
woman
must
cook
for
themselves
each
person
must
have
his
own
fire
the
tuaregs
of
the
sahara
never
eat
or
drink
in
presence
of
any
one
else
the
thompson
indians
of
british
columbia
thought
that
a
shaman
could
bewitch
them
most
easily
when
they
were
eating
drinking
or
smoking
hence
they
avoided
doing
any
of
these
things
in
presence
of
an
unknown
shaman
in
fiji
persons
who
suspected
others
of
plotting
against
them
avoided
eating
in
their
presence
or
were
careful
to
leave
no
fragment
of
food
behind
if
these
are
the
ordinary
precautions
taken
by
common
people
the
precautions
taken
by
kings
are
extraordinary
the
king
of
loango
may
not
be
seen
eating
or
drinking
by
man
or
beast
under
pain
of
death
a
favourite
dog
having
broken
into
the
room
where
the
king
was
dining
the
king
ordered
it
to
be
killed
on
the
spot
once
the
king
s
own
son
a
boy
of
twelve
years
old
inadvertently
saw
the
king
drink
immediately
the
king
ordered
him
to
be
finely
apparelled
and
feasted
after
which
he
commanded
him
to
be
cut
in
quarters
and
carried
about
the
city
with
a
proclamation
that
he
had
seen
the
king
drink
when
the
king
has
a
mind
to
drink
he
has
a
cup
of
wine
brought
he
that
brings
it
has
a
bell
in
his
hand
and
as
soon
as
he
has
delivered
the
cup
to
the
king
he
turns
his
face
from
him
and
rings
the
bell
on
which
all
present
fall
down
with
their
faces
to
the
ground
and
continue
so
till
the
king
has
drank
his
eating
is
much
in
the
same
style
for
which
he
has
a
house
on
purpose
where
his
victuals
are
set
upon
a
bensa
or
table
which
he
goes
to
and
shuts
the
door
when
he
has
done
he
knocks
and
comes
out
so
that
none
ever
see
the
king
eat
or
drink
for
it
is
believed
that
if
any
one
should
the
king
shall
immediately
the
remnants
of
his
food
are
buried
doubtless
to
prevent
them
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
sorcerers
who
by
means
of
these
fragments
might
cast
a
fatal
spell
over
the
monarch
the
rules
observed
by
the
neighbouring
king
of
cacongo
were
similar
it
was
thought
that
the
king
would
die
if
any
of
his
subjects
were
to
see
him
drink
it
is
a
capital
offence
to
see
the
king
of
dahomey
at
his
meals
when
he
drinks
in
public
as
he
does
on
extraordinary
occasions
he
hides
himself
behind
a
curtain
or
handkerchiefs
are
held
up
round
his
head
and
all
the
people
throw
themselves
with
their
faces
to
the
earth
any
one
who
saw
the
muata
jamwo
a
great
potentate
in
the
congo
basin
eating
or
drinking
would
certainly
be
put
to
death
when
the
king
of
cazembe
raises
his
glass
to
his
mouth
to
drink
all
who
are
present
prostrate
themselves
and
avert
their
faces
in
such
a
manner
as
not
to
see
him
drinking
at
asaba
on
the
lower
niger
where
the
kings
or
chiefs
number
fully
four
hundred
no
one
is
allowed
to
prepare
the
royal
dishes
the
chiefs
act
as
their
own
cooks
and
eat
in
the
strictest
privacy
the
king
and
royal
family
of
walo
on
the
senegal
never
take
their
meals
in
public
it
is
expressly
forbidden
to
see
them
eating
among
the
monbutto
of
central
africa
the
king
invariably
takes
his
meals
in
private
no
one
may
see
the
contents
of
his
dish
and
all
that
he
leaves
is
carefully
thrown
into
a
pit
set
apart
for
that
purpose
everything
that
the
king
has
handled
is
held
sacred
and
may
not
be
touched
when
the
king
of
unyoro
in
central
africa
went
to
drink
milk
in
the
dairy
every
man
must
leave
the
royal
enclosure
and
all
the
women
had
to
cover
their
heads
till
the
king
returned
no
one
might
see
him
drink
one
wife
accompanied
him
to
the
dairy
and
handed
him
the
but
she
turned
away
her
face
while
he
drained
it
the
king
of
susa
a
region
to
the
south
of
abyssinia
presides
daily
at
the
feast
in
the
long
but
is
hidden
from
the
gaze
of
his
subjects
by
a
curtain
among
the
peoples
of
the
slave
coast
the
person
of
the
king
is
sacred
and
if
he
drinks
in
public
every
one
must
turn
away
the
head
so
as
not
to
see
him
while
some
of
the
women
of
the
court
hold
up
a
cloth
before
him
as
a
screen
he
never
eats
in
public
and
the
people
pretend
to
believe
that
he
neither
eats
nor
sleeps
it
is
criminal
to
say
the
contrary
when
the
king
of
tonga
ate
all
the
people
turned
their
backs
to
him
in
the
palace
of
the
persian
kings
there
were
two
opposite
each
other
in
one
of
them
the
king
dined
in
the
other
his
guests
he
could
see
them
through
a
curtain
on
the
door
but
they
could
not
see
him
generally
the
king
took
his
meals
alone
but
sometimes
his
wife
or
some
of
his
sons
dined
with
him
taboos
on
shewing
the
face
in
some
of
the
preceding
cases
the
intention
of
eating
and
drinking
in
strict
seclusion
may
perhaps
be
to
hinder
evil
influences
from
entering
the
body
rather
than
to
prevent
the
escape
of
the
soul
this
certainly
is
the
motive
of
some
drinking
customs
observed
by
natives
of
the
congo
region
thus
we
are
told
of
these
people
that
there
is
hardly
a
native
who
would
dare
to
swallow
a
liquid
without
first
conjuring
the
spirits
one
of
them
rings
a
bell
all
the
time
he
is
drinking
another
crouches
down
and
places
his
left
hand
on
the
earth
another
veils
his
head
another
puts
a
stalk
of
grass
or
a
leaf
in
his
hair
or
marks
his
forehead
with
a
line
of
clay
this
fetish
custom
assumes
very
varied
forms
to
explain
them
the
black
is
satisfied
to
say
that
they
are
an
energetic
mode
of
conjuring
in
this
part
of
the
world
a
chief
will
commonly
ring
a
bell
at
each
draught
of
beer
which
he
swallows
and
at
the
same
moment
a
lad
stationed
in
front
of
him
brandishes
a
spear
to
keep
at
bay
the
spirits
which
might
try
to
sneak
into
the
old
chief
s
body
by
the
same
road
as
the
beer
the
same
motive
of
warding
off
evil
spirits
probably
explains
the
custom
observed
by
some
african
sultans
of
veiling
their
faces
the
sultan
of
darfur
wraps
up
his
face
with
a
piece
of
white
muslin
which
goes
round
his
head
several
times
covering
his
mouth
and
nose
first
and
then
his
forehead
so
that
only
his
eyes
are
visible
the
same
custom
of
veiling
the
face
as
a
mark
of
sovereignty
is
said
to
be
observed
in
other
parts
of
central
africa
the
sultan
of
wadai
always
speaks
from
behind
a
curtain
no
one
sees
his
face
except
his
intimates
and
a
few
favoured
persons
similarly
the
sultan
of
bornu
never
shewed
himself
to
his
people
and
only
spoke
to
them
from
behind
a
curtain
the
king
of
chonga
a
town
on
the
right
bank
of
the
niger
above
egga
may
not
be
seen
by
his
subjects
nor
by
strangers
at
an
interview
he
sits
in
his
palace
concealed
by
a
mat
which
hangs
like
a
curtain
and
from
behind
it
he
converses
with
his
visitor
the
muysca
indians
of
colombia
had
such
a
respect
for
their
chiefs
that
they
dared
not
lift
their
eyes
on
them
but
always
turned
their
backs
when
they
had
to
address
them
if
a
thief
after
repeated
punishments
proved
incorrigible
they
took
him
to
the
chief
and
one
of
the
nobles
turning
the
culprit
round
said
to
him
since
you
think
yourself
so
great
a
lord
that
you
have
the
right
to
break
the
laws
you
have
the
right
to
look
at
the
from
that
moment
the
criminal
was
regarded
as
infamous
nobody
would
have
anything
to
do
with
him
or
even
speak
to
him
and
he
died
an
outcast
montezuma
was
revered
by
his
subjects
as
a
god
and
he
set
so
much
store
on
their
reverence
that
if
on
going
out
of
the
city
he
saw
a
man
lift
up
his
eyes
on
him
he
had
the
rash
gazer
put
to
death
he
generally
lived
in
the
retirement
of
his
palace
seldom
shewing
himself
on
the
days
when
he
went
to
visit
his
gardens
he
was
carried
in
a
litter
through
a
street
which
was
enclosed
by
walls
none
but
his
bearers
had
the
right
to
pass
along
that
street
it
was
a
law
of
the
medes
that
their
king
should
be
seen
by
nobody
the
king
of
jebu
on
the
slave
coast
of
west
africa
is
surrounded
by
a
great
deal
of
mystery
until
lately
his
face
might
not
be
seen
even
by
his
own
subjects
and
if
circumstances
compelled
him
to
communicate
with
them
he
did
so
through
a
screen
which
concealed
him
from
view
now
though
his
face
may
be
seen
it
is
customary
to
hide
his
body
and
at
audiences
a
cloth
is
held
before
him
so
as
to
conceal
him
from
the
neck
downwards
and
it
is
raised
so
as
to
cover
him
altogether
whenever
he
coughs
sneezes
spits
or
takes
snuff
his
face
is
partially
hidden
by
a
conical
cap
with
hanging
strings
of
beads
amongst
the
tuaregs
of
the
sahara
all
the
men
but
not
the
women
keep
the
lower
part
of
their
face
especially
the
mouth
veiled
constantly
the
veil
is
never
put
off
not
even
in
eating
or
sleeping
among
the
arabs
men
remarkable
for
their
good
looks
have
been
known
to
veil
their
faces
especially
at
festivals
and
markets
in
order
to
protect
themselves
against
the
evil
eye
the
same
reason
may
explain
the
custom
of
muffling
their
faces
which
has
been
observed
by
arab
women
from
the
earliest
times
and
by
the
women
of
boeotian
thebes
in
antiquity
in
samoa
a
man
whose
family
god
was
the
turtle
might
not
eat
a
turtle
and
if
he
helped
a
neighbour
to
cut
up
and
cook
one
he
had
to
wear
a
bandage
tied
over
his
mouth
lest
an
embryo
turtle
should
slip
down
his
throat
grow
up
and
be
his
death
in
west
timor
a
speaker
holds
his
right
hand
before
his
mouth
in
speaking
lest
a
demon
should
enter
his
body
and
lest
the
person
with
whom
he
converses
should
harm
the
speaker
s
soul
by
magic
in
new
south
wales
for
some
time
after
his
initiation
into
the
tribal
mysteries
a
young
blackfellow
whose
soul
at
this
time
is
in
a
critical
state
must
always
cover
his
mouth
with
a
rug
when
a
woman
is
present
we
have
already
seen
how
common
is
the
notion
that
the
life
or
soul
may
escape
by
the
mouth
or
nostrils
taboos
on
quitting
the
house
by
an
extension
of
the
like
precaution
kings
are
sometimes
forbidden
ever
to
leave
their
palaces
or
if
they
are
allowed
to
do
so
their
subjects
are
forbidden
to
see
them
abroad
we
have
seen
that
the
priestly
king
at
shark
point
west
africa
may
never
quit
his
house
or
even
his
chair
in
which
he
is
obliged
to
sleep
sitting
and
that
the
king
of
fernando
po
whom
no
white
man
may
see
is
reported
to
be
confined
to
his
house
with
shackles
on
his
legs
the
fetish
king
of
benin
who
was
worshipped
as
a
deity
by
his
subjects
might
not
quit
his
palace
after
his
coronation
the
king
of
loango
is
confined
to
his
palace
which
he
may
not
leave
the
king
of
onitsha
on
the
niger
does
not
step
out
of
his
house
into
the
town
unless
a
human
sacrifice
is
made
to
propitiate
the
gods
on
this
account
he
never
goes
out
beyond
the
precincts
of
his
indeed
we
are
told
that
he
may
not
quit
his
palace
under
pain
of
death
or
of
giving
up
one
or
more
slaves
to
be
executed
in
his
presence
as
the
wealth
of
the
country
is
measured
in
slaves
the
king
takes
good
care
not
to
infringe
the
law
one
day
the
monarch
charmed
by
some
presents
which
he
had
received
from
a
french
officer
politely
attended
his
visitor
to
the
gate
and
in
a
moment
of
forgetfulness
was
about
to
break
bounds
when
his
chamberlain
seizing
his
majesty
by
his
legs
and
his
wives
friends
and
servants
rushing
up
prevented
him
from
taking
so
fatal
a
step
yet
once
a
year
at
the
feast
of
yams
the
king
is
allowed
and
even
required
by
custom
to
dance
before
his
people
outside
the
high
mud
wall
of
the
palace
in
dancing
he
carries
a
great
weight
generally
a
sack
of
earth
on
his
back
to
prove
that
he
is
still
able
to
support
the
burden
and
cares
of
state
were
he
unable
to
discharge
this
duty
he
would
be

be
confined
for
years

narrow

often
looked
upon
as
half
divine

to

power

they
require
it
and
of
bringing
them
good

in
antiquity
a
rude
and
warlike
people
named
the
mosyni
or
mosynoeci
through
whose
rugged
country
the
ten
thousand
marched
on
their
famous
retreat
from
asia
to
europe
these
barbarians
kept
their
king
in
close
custody
at
the
top
of
a
high
tower
from
which
after
his
election
he
was
never
more
allowed
to
descend
here
he
dispensed
justice
to
his
people
but
if
he
offended
them
they
punished
him
by
stopping
his
rations
for
a
whole
day
or
even
starving
him
to
death
the
kings
of
sabaea
or
sheba
the
spice
country
of
arabia
were
not
allowed
to
go
out
of
their
palaces
if
they
did
so
the
mob
stoned
them
to
death
but
at
the
top
of
the
palace
there
was
a
window
with
a
chain
attached
to
it
if
any
man
deemed
he
had
suffered
wrong
he
pulled
the
chain
and
the
king
perceived
him
and
called
him
in
and
gave
judgment
so
down
to
recent
times
the
kings
of
corea
whose
persons
were
sacred
and
received
honours
almost
divine
were
shut
up
in
their
palace
from
the
age
of
twelve
or
fifteen
and
if
a
suitor
wished
to
obtain
justice
of
the
king
he
sometimes
lit
a
great
bonfire
on
a
mountain
facing
the
palace
the
king
saw
the
fire
and
informed
himself
of
the
case
the
emperor
of
china
seldom
quits
his
palace
and
when
he
does
so
no
one
may
look
at
him
even
the
guards
who
line
the
road
must
turn
their
backs
the
king
of
tonquin
was
permitted
to
appear
abroad
twice
or
thrice
a
year
for
the
performance
of
certain
religious
ceremonies
but
the
people
were
not
allowed
to
look
at
him
the
day
before
he
came
forth
notice
was
given
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
and
country
to
keep
from
the
way
the
king
was
to
go
the
women
were
obliged
to
remain
in
their
houses
and
durst
not
shew
themselves
under
pain
of
death
a
penalty
which
was
carried
out
on
the
spot
if
any
one
disobeyed
the
order
even
through
ignorance
thus
the
king
was
invisible
to
all
but
his
troops
and
the
officers
of
his
suite
in
mandalay
a
stout
six
feet
high
and
carefully
kept
in
repair
lined
every
street
in
the
walled
city
and
all
those
streets
in
the
suburbs
through
which
the
king
was
likely
at
any
time
to
pass
behind
this
paling
which
stood
two
feet
or
so
from
the
houses
all
the
people
had
to
stay
when
the
king
or
any
of
the
queens
went
out
any
one
who
was
caught
outside
it
by
the
beadles
after
the
procession
had
started
was
severely
handled
and
might
think
himself
lucky
if
he
got
off
with
a
beating
nobody
was
supposed
to
peep
through
the
holes
in
the
which
were
besides
partly
stopped
up

magic
mischief
may
be
wrought
upon
a

through
the
remains
of
the
food
he
has
partaken
of
or
the
dishes
out
of
which
he
has
eaten
on
the
principles
of
sympathetic
magic
a
real
connexion
continues
to
subsist
between
the
food
which
a
man
has
in
his
stomach
and
the
refuse
of
it
which
he
has
left
untouched
and
hence
by
injuring
the
refuse
you
can
simultaneously
injure
the
eater
among
the
narrinyeri
of
south
australia
every
adult
is
constantly
on
the
for
bones
of
beasts
birds
or
fish
of
which
the
flesh
has
been
eaten
by
somebody
in
order
to
construct
a
deadly
charm
out
of
them
every
one
is
therefore
careful
to
burn
the
bones
of
the
animals
which
he
has
eaten
lest
they
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
a
sorcerer
too
often
however
the
sorcerer
succeeds
in
getting
hold
of
such
a
bone
and
when
he
does
so
he
believes
that
he
has
the
power
of
life
and
death
over
the
man
woman
or
child
who
ate
the
flesh
of
the
animal
to
put
the
charm
in
operation
he
makes
a
paste
of
red
ochre
and
fish
oil
inserts
in
it
the
eye
of
a
cod
and
a
small
piece
of
the
flesh
of
a
corpse
and
having
rolled
the
compound
into
a
ball
sticks
it
on
the
top
of
the
bone
after
being
left
for
some
time
in
the
bosom
of
a
dead
body
in
order
that
it
may
derive
a
deadly
potency
by
contact
with
corruption
the
magical
implement
is
set
up
in
the
ground
near
the
fire
and
as
the
ball
melts
so
the
person
against
whom
the
charm
is
directed
wastes
with
disease
if
the
ball
is
melted
quite
away
the
victim
will
die
when
the
bewitched
man
learns
of
the
spell
that
is
being
cast
upon
him
he
endeavours
to
buy
the
bone
from
the
sorcerer
and
if
he
obtains
it
he
breaks
the
charm
by
throwing
the
bone
into
a
river
or
lake
further
the
narrinyeri
think
that
if
a
man
eats
of
the
totem
animal
of
his
tribe
and
an
enemy
obtains
a
portion
of
the
flesh
the
latter
can
make
it
grow
in
the
inside
of
the
eater
and
so
cause
his
death
therefore
when
a
man
partakes
of
his
totem
he
is
careful
either
to
eat
it
all
or
else
to
conceal
or
destroy
the
refuse
in
the
encounter
bay
tribe
of
south
australia
when
a
man
can
not
get
the
bone
of
an
animal
which
his
enemy
has
eaten
he
cooks
a
bird
beast
or
fish
and
keeping
back
one
of
the
creature
s
bones
offers
the
rest
under
the
guise
of
friendship
to
his
enemy
if
the
man
is
simple
enough
to
partake
of
the
proffered
food
he
is
at
the
mercy
of
his
perfidious
foe
who
can
kill
him
by
placing
the
abstracted
bone
near
the
fire
ideas
and
practices
of
the
same
sort
prevail
or
used
to
prevail
in
melanesia
all
that
was
needed
to
injure
a
man
was
to
bring
the
leavings
of
his
food
into
contact
with
a
malignant
ghost
or
spirit
hence
in
the
island
of
florida
when
a
scrap
of
an
enemy
s
dinner
was
secreted
and
thrown
into
a
haunted
place
the
man
was
supposed
to
fall
ill
and
in
the
new
hebrides
if
a
snake
of
a
certain
sort
carried
away
a
fragment
of
food
to
a
spot
sacred
to
a
spirit
the
man
who
had
eaten
the
food
would
sicken
as
the
fragment
decayed
in
aurora
the
refuse
is
made
up
by
the
wizard
with
certain
leaves
as
these
rot
and
stink
the
man
dies
hence
it
is
or
was
a
constant
care
with
the
melanesians
to
prevent
the
remains
of
their
meals
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
persons
who
bore
them
a
grudge
for
this
reason
they
regularly
gave
the
refuse
of
food
to
the
pigs
in
tana
one
of
the
new
hebrides
people
bury
or
throw
into
the
sea
the
leavings
of
their
food
lest
these
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
for
if
a
finds
the
remnants
of
a
meal
say
the
skin
of
a
banana
he
picks
it
up
and
burns
it
slowly
in
the
fire
as
it
burns
the
person
who
ate
the
banana
falls
ill
and
sends
to
the
offering
him
presents
if
he
will
stop
burning
the
banana
skin
in
german
new
guinea
the
natives
take
the
utmost
care
to
destroy
or
conceal
the
husks
and
other
remains
of
their
food
lest
these
should
be
found
by
their
enemies
and
used
by
them
for
the
injury
or
destruction
of
the
eaters
hence
they
burn
their
leavings
throw
them
into
the
sea
or
otherwise
put
them
out
of
harm
s
way
to
such
an
extent
does
this
fear
influence
them
that
many
people
dare
not
stir
beyond
the
territory
of
their
own
village
lest
they
should
leave
behind
them
on
the
land
of
their
neighbours
something
by
means
of
which
a
hostile
sorcerer
might
do
them
a
mischief
similar
fears
have
led
to
similar
customs
in
new
britain
and
the
other
islands
of
what
is
now
called
the
bismarck
archipelago
off
the
north
coast
of
new
guinea
there
also
the
natives
bury
burn
or
throw
into
the
sea
the
remains
of
their
meals
to
prevent
them
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
magicians
there
also
the
more
superstitious
of
them
will
not
eat
in
another
village
because
they
dread
the
use
which
a
sorcerer
might
make
of
their
leavings
when
their
back
is
turned
this
theory
has
led
to
an
odd
practical
result
all
the
cats
in
the
islands
of
the
archipelago
go
about
with
stumpy
tails
the
reason
of
the
peculiarity
is
this
the
natives
sometimes
roast
and
eat
their
cats
and
unscrupulous
persons
might
be
tempted
to
steal
a
neighbour
s
cat
in
order
to
furnish
a
meal
accordingly
in
the
interests
of
the
higher
morality
people
remove
this
from
the
path
of
their
weaker
brothers
by
docking
their
cats
of
a
piece
of
their
tails
and
keeping
the
severed
portions
in
a
secret
place
if
now
a
cat
is
stolen
and
eaten
the
lawful
owner
of
the
animal
has
it
in
his
power
to
avenge
the
crime
he
need
only
bury
the
piece
of
tail
with
certain
spells
in
the
ground
and
the
thief
will
fall
ill
hence
a
man
will
hardly
dare
to
steal
and
eat
a
cat
with
a
stumpy
tail
knowing
the
righteous
retribution
that
would
sooner
or
later
overtake
him
for
so
doing
from
a
like
fear
no
doubt
of
sorcery
no
one
may
touch
the
food
which
the
king
of
loango
leaves
upon
his
plate
it
is
buried
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
no
one
may
drink
out
of
the
king
s
vessel
similarly
no
man
may
drink
out
of
the
same
cup
or
glass
with
the
king
of
fida
whydah
in
guinea
he
hath
always
one
kept
particularly
for
himself
and
that
which
hath
but
once
touched
another
s
lips
he
never
uses
more
though
it
be
made
of
metal
that
may
be
cleansed
by
amongst
the
alfoors
of
celebes
there
is
a
priest
called
the
whose
duty
appears
to
be
to
make
the
rice
grow
his
functions
begin
about
a
month
before
the
rice
is
sown
and
end
after
the
crop
is
housed
during
this
time
he
has
to
observe
certain
taboos
amongst
others
he
may
not
eat
or
drink
with
any
one
else
and
he
may
drink
out
of
no
vessel
but
his
own
an
ancient
indian
way
of
injuring
an
enemy
was
to
offer
him
a
meal
of
rice
and
afterwards
throw
the
remains
of
the
rice
into
a
fishpond
if
the
fish
swam
up
in
large
numbers
to
devour
the
grains
the
man
s
fate
was
sealed
in
antiquity
the
romans
used
immediately
to
break
the
shells
of
eggs
and
of
snails
which
they
had
eaten
in
order
to
prevent
enemies
from
making
magic
with
them
the
common
practice
still
observed
among
us
of
breaking
after
the
eggs
have
been
eaten
may
very
well
have
originated
in
the
same
superstition
the
superstitious
fear
of
the
magic
that
may
be
wrought
on
a
man
through
the
leavings
of
his
food
has
had
the
beneficial
effect
of
inducing
many
savages
to
destroy
refuse
which
if
left
to
rot
might
through
its
corruption
have
proved
a
real
not
a
merely
imaginary
source
of
disease
and
death
nor
is
it
only
the
sanitary
condition
of
a
tribe
which
has
benefited
by
this
superstition
curiously
enough
the
same
baseless
dread
the
same
false
notion
of
causation
has
indirectly
strengthened
the
moral
bonds
of
hospitality
honour
and
good
faith
among
men
who
entertain
it
for
it
is
obvious
that
no
one
who
intends
to
harm
a
man
by
working
magic
on
the
refuse
of
his
food
will
himself
partake
of
that
food
because
if
he
did
so
he
would
on
the
principles
of
sympathetic
magic
suffer
equally
with
his
enemy
from
any
injury
done
to
the
refuse
this
is
the
idea
which
in
primitive
society
lends
sanctity
to
the
bond
produced
by
eating
together
by
participation
in
the
same
food
two
men
give
as
it
were
hostages
for
their
good
behaviour
each
guarantees
the
other
that
he
will
devise
no
mischief
against
him
since
being
physically
united
with
him
by
the
common
food
in
their
stomachs
any
harm
he
might
do
to
his
fellow
would
recoil
on
his
own
head
with
precisely
the
same
force
with
which
it
fell
on
the
head
of
his
victim
in
strict
logic
however
the
sympathetic
bond
lasts
only
so
long
as
the
food
is
in
the
stomach
of
each
of
the
parties
hence
the
covenant
formed
by
eating
together
is
less
solemn
and
durable
than
the
covenant
formed
by
transfusing
the
blood
of
the
covenanting
parties
into
each
other
s
veins
for
this
transfusion
seems
to
knit
them
together
for
life
chapter
iv
tabooed
persons
chiefs
and
kings
tabooed
we
have
seen
that
the
mikado
s
food
was
cooked
every
day
in
new
pots
and
served
up
in
new
dishes
both
pots
and
dishes
were
of
common
clay
in
order
that
they
might
be
broken
or
laid
aside
after
they
had
been
once
used
they
were
generally
broken
for
it
was
believed
that
if
any
one
else
ate
his
food
out
of
these
sacred
dishes
his
mouth
and
throat
would
become
swollen
and
inflamed
the
same
ill
effect
was
thought
to
be
experienced
by
any
one
who
should
wear
the
mikado
s
clothes
without
his
leave
he
would
have
swellings
and
pains
all
over
his
body
in
fiji
there
is
a
special
name
for
the
disease
supposed
to
be
caused
by
eating
out
of
a
chief
s
dishes
or
wearing
his
clothes
the
throat
and
body
swell
and
the
impious
person
dies
i
had
a
fine
mat
given
to
me
by
a
man
who
durst
not
use
it
because
thakambau
s
eldest
son
had
sat
upon
it
there
was
always
a
family
or
clan
of
commoners
who
were
exempt
from
this
danger
i
was
talking
about
this
once
to
thakambau
oh
yes
said
he
here
come
and
scratch
my
the
man
scratched
he
was
one
of
those
who
could
do
it
with
the
name
of
the
men
thus
highly
privileged
was
nduka
or
the
dirt
of

in
the
evil
effects
thus
supposed
to
follow
upon
the
use
of
the
vessels
or
clothes
of
the
mikado
and
a
fijian
chief
we
see
that
other
side
of
the
s
character
to
which
attention
has
been
already
called
the
divine
person
is
a
source
of
danger
as
well
as
of
blessing
he
must
not
only
be
guarded
he
must
also
be
guarded
against
his
sacred
organism
so
delicate
that
a
touch
may
disorder
it
is
also
as
it
were
electrically
charged
with
a
powerful
magical
or
spiritual
force
which
may
discharge
itself
with
fatal
effect
on
whatever
comes
in
contact
with
it
accordingly
the
isolation
of
the
is
quite
as
necessary
for
the
safety
of
others
as
for
his
own
his
magical
virtue
is
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
word
contagious
his
divinity
is
a
fire
which
under
proper
restraints
confers
endless
blessings
but
if
rashly
touched
or
allowed
to
break
bounds
burns
and
destroys
what
it
touches
hence
the
disastrous
effects
supposed
to
attend
a
breach
of
taboo
the
offender
has
thrust
his
hand
into
the
divine
fire
which
shrivels
up
and
consumes
him
on
the
spot
the
nubas
for
example
who
inhabit
the
wooded
and
fertile
range
of
jebel
nuba
in
eastern
africa
believe
that
they
would
die
if
they
entered
the
house
of
their
priestly
king
however
they
can
evade
the
penalty
of
their
intrusion
by
baring
the
left
shoulder
and
getting
the
king
to
lay
his
hand
on
it
and
were
any
man
to
sit
on
a
stone
which
the
king
has
consecrated
to
his
own
use
the
transgressor
would
die
within
the
year
the
cazembes
in
the
interior
of
angola
regard
their
king
the
or
as
so
holy
that
no
one
can
touch
him
without
being
killed
by
the
magical
power
which
pervades
his
sacred
person
but
since
contact
with
him
is
sometimes
unavoidable
they
have
devised
a
means
whereby
the
sinner
can
escape
with
his
life
kneeling
down
before
the
king
he
touches
the
back
of
the
royal
hand
with
the
back
of
his
own
then
snaps
his
fingers
afterwards
he
lays
the
palm
of
his
hand
on
the
palm
of
the
king
s
hand
then
snaps
his
fingers
again
this
ceremony
is
repeated
four
or
five
times
and
averts
the
imminent
danger
of
death
in
tonga
it
was
believed
that
if
any
one
fed
himself
with
his
own
hands
after
touching
the
sacred
person
of
a
superior
chief
or
anything
that
belonged
to
him
he
would
swell
up
and
die
the
sanctity
of
the
chief
like
a
virulent
poison
infected
the
hands
of
his
inferior
and
being
communicated
through
them
to
the
food
proved
fatal
to
the
eater
a
commoner
who
had
incurred
this
danger
could
disinfect
himself
by
performing
a
certain
ceremony
which
consisted
in
touching
the
sole
of
a
chief
s
foot
with
the
palm
and
back
of
each
of
his
hands
and
afterwards
rinsing
his
hands
in
water
if
there
was
no
water
near
he
rubbed
his
hands
with
the
juicy
stem
of
a
plantain
or
banana
after
that
he
was
free
to
feed
himself
with
his
own
hands
without
danger
of
being
attacked
by
the
malady
which
would
otherwise
follow
from
eating
with
tabooed
or
sanctified
hands
but
until
the
ceremony
of
expiation
or
disinfection
had
been
performed
if
he
wished
to
eat
he
had
either
to
get
some
one
to
feed
him
or
else
to
go
down
on
his
knees
and
pick
up
the
food
from
the
ground
with
his
mouth
like
a
beast
he
might
not
even
use
a
toothpick
himself
but
might
guide
the
hand
of
another
person
holding
the
toothpick
the
tongans
were
subject
to
induration
of
the
liver
and
certain
forms
of
scrofula
which
they
often
attributed
to
a
failure
to
perform
the
requisite
expiation
after
having
inadvertently
touched
a
chief
or
his
belongings
hence
they
often
went
through
the
ceremony
as
a
precaution
without
knowing
that
they
had
done
anything
to
call
for
it
the
king
of
tonga
could
not
refuse
to
play
his
part
in
the
rite
by
presenting
his
foot
to
such
as
desired
to
touch
it
even
when
they
applied
to
him
at
an
inconvenient
time
a
fat
unwieldy
king
who
perceived
his
subjects
approaching
with
this
intention
while
he
chanced
to
be
taking
his
walks
abroad
has
been
sometimes
seen
to
waddle
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
out
of
their
way
in
order
to
escape
the
importunate
and
not
wholly
disinterested
expression
of
their
homage
if
any
one
fancied
he
might
have
already
unwittingly
eaten
with
tabooed
hands
he
sat
down
before
the
chief
and
taking
the
chief
s
foot
pressed
it
against
his
own
stomach
that
the
food
in
his
belly
might
not
injure
him
and
that
he
might
not
swell
up
and
die
since
scrofula
was
regarded
by
the
tongans
as
a
result
of
eating
with
tabooed
hands
we
may
conjecture
that
persons
who
suffered
from
it
among
them
often
resorted
to
the
touch
or
pressure
of
the
king
s
foot
as
a
cure
for
their
malady
the
analogy
of
the
custom
with
the
old
english
practice
of
bringing
scrofulous
patients
to
the
king
to
be
healed
by
his
touch
is
sufficiently
obvious
and
suggests
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
elsewhere
that
among
our
own
remote
ancestors
scrofula
may
have
obtained
its
name
of
the
king
s
evil
from
a
belief
like
that
of
the
tongans
that
it
was
caused
as
well
as
cured
by
contact
with
the
divine
majesty
of
kings
in
new
zealand
the
dread
of
the
sanctity
of
chiefs
was
at
least
as
great
as
in
tonga
their
ghostly
power
derived
from
an
ancestral
spirit
or
diffused
itself
by
contagion
over
everything
they
touched
and
could
strike
dead
all
who
rashly
or
unwittingly
meddled
with
it
for
instance
it
once
happened
that
a
new
zealand
chief
of
high
rank
and
great
sanctity
had
left
the
remains
of
his
dinner
by
the
wayside
a
slave
a
stout
hungry
fellow
coming
up
after
the
chief
had
gone
saw
the
unfinished
dinner
and
ate
it
up
without
asking
questions
hardly
had
he
finished
when
he
was
informed
by
a
spectator
that
the
food
of
which
he
had
eaten
was
the
chief
s
i
knew
the
unfortunate
delinquent
well
he
was
remarkable
for
courage
and
had
signalised
himself
in
the
wars
of
the
tribe
but
no
sooner
did
he
hear
the
fatal
news
than
he
was
seized
by
the
most
extraordinary
convulsions
and
cramp
in
the
stomach
which
never
ceased
till
he
died
about
sundown
the
same
day
he
was
a
strong
man
in
the
prime
of
life
and
if
any
pakeha
european
freethinker
should
have
said
he
was
not
killed
by
the
of
the
chief
which
had
been
communicated
to
the
food
by
contact
he
would
have
been
listened
to
with
feelings
of
contempt
for
his
ignorance
and
inability
to
understand
plain
and
direct
this
is
not
a
solitary
case
a
maori
woman
having
eaten
of
some
fruit
and
being
afterwards
told
that
the
fruit
had
been
taken
from
a
tabooed
place
exclaimed
that
the
spirit
of
the
chief
whose
sanctity
had
been
thus
profaned
would
kill
her
this
was
in
the
afternoon
and
next
day
by
twelve
o
clock
she
was
dead
an
observer
who
knows
the
maoris
well
says
tapu
taboo
is
an
awful
weapon
i
have
seen
a
strong
young
man
die
the
same
day
he
was
tapued
the
victims
die
under
it
as
though
their
strength
ran
out
as
a
maori
chief
s
was
once
the
means
of
killing
several
persons
for
having
been
lost
by
him
and
found
by
some
men
who
used
it
to
light
their
pipes
they
died
of
fright
on
learning
to
whom
it
had
belonged
so
too
the
garments
of
a
high
new
zealand
chief
will
kill
any
one
else
who
wears
them
a
chief
was
observed
by
a
missionary
to
throw
down
a
precipice
a
blanket
which
he
found
too
heavy
to
carry
being
asked
by
the
missionary
why
he
did
not
leave
it
on
a
tree
for
the
use
of
a
future
traveller
the
chief
replied
that
it
was
the
fear
of
its
being
taken
by
another
which
caused
him
to
throw
it
where
he
did
for
if
it
were
worn
his
tapu
that
is
his
spiritual
power
communicated
by
contact
to
the
blanket
and
through
the
blanket
to
the
man
would
kill
the
for
a
similar
reason
a
maori
chief
would
not
blow
a
fire
with
his
mouth
for
his
sacred
breath
would
communicate
its
sanctity
to
the
fire
which
would
pass
it
on
to
the
pot
on
the
fire
which
would
pass
it
on
to
the
meat
in
the
pot
which
would
pass
it
on
to
the
man
who
ate
the
meat
which
was
in
the
pot
which
stood
on
the
fire
which
was
breathed
on
by
the
chief
so
that
the
eater
infected
by
the
chief
s
breath
conveyed
through
these
intermediaries
would
surely
die
thus
in
the
polynesian
race
to
which
the
maoris
belong
superstition
erected
round
the
persons
of
sacred
chiefs
a
real
though
at
the
same
time
purely
imaginary
barrier
to
transgress
which
actually
entailed
the
death
of
the
transgressor
whenever
he
became
aware
of
what
he
had
done
this
fatal
power
of
the
imagination
working
through
superstitious
terrors
is
by
no
means
confined
to
one
race
it
appears
to
be
common
among
savages
for
example
among
the
aborigines
of
australia
a
native
will
die
after
the
infliction
of
even
the
most
superficial
wound
if
only
he
believes
that
the
weapon
which
inflicted
the
wound
had
been
sung
over
and
thus
endowed
with
magical
virtue
he
simply
lies
down
refuses
food
and
pines
away
similarly
among
some
of
the
indian
tribes
of
brazil
if
the
predicted
the
death
of
any
one
who
had
offended
him
the
wretch
took
to
his
hammock
instantly
in
such
full
expectation
of
dying
that
he
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
and
the
prediction
was
a
sentence
which
faith
effectually
speaking
of
certain
african
races
major
leonard
observes
i
have
seen
more
than
one
hardened
old
haussa
soldier
dying
steadily
and
by
inches
because
he
believed
himself
to
be
bewitched
so
that
no
nourishment
or
medicines
that
were
given
to
him
had
the
slightest
effect
either
to
check
the
mischief
or
to
improve
his
condition
in
any
way
and
nothing
was
able
to
divert
him
from
a
fate
which
he
considered
inevitable
in
the
same
way
and
under
very
similar
conditions
i
have
seen
and
others
die
in
spite
of
every
effort
that
was
made
to
save
them
simply
because
they
had
made
up
their
minds
not
as
we
thought
at
the
time
to
die
but
that
being
in
the
clutch
of
malignant
demons
they
were
bound
to
the
capuchin
missionary
merolla
da
sorrento
who
travelled
in
the
west
african
kingdom
of
congo
in
the
latter
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
has
described
a
remarkable
case
of
death
wrought
purely
by
superstitious
fear
he
says
it
is
a
custom
that
either
the
parents
or
the
wizards
give
certain
rules
to
be
inviolably
observed
by
the
young
people
and
which
they
call
these
are
to
abstain
from
eating
either
some
sorts
of
poultry
the
flesh
of
some
kinds
of
wild
beasts
such
and
such
fruits
roots
either
raw
or
boiled
after
this
or
another
manner
with
several
other
ridiculous
injunctions
of
the
like
nature
too
many
to
be
enumerated
here
you
would
wonder
with
what
religious
observance
these
commands
are
obeyed
these
young
people
would
sooner
chuse
to
fast
several
days
together
than
to
taste
the
least
bit
of
what
has
been
forbidden
them
and
if
it
sometimes
happen
that
the
has
been
neglected
to
have
been
given
them
by
their
parents
they
think
they
shall
presently
die
unless
they
go
immediately
to
receive
it
from
the
wizards
a
certain
young
negro
being
upon
a
journey
lodged
in
a
friend
s
house
by
the
way
his
friend
before
he
went
out
the
next
morning
had
got
a
wild
hen
ready
for
his
breakfast
they
being
much
better
than
the
tame
ones
the
negro
hereupon
demanded
if
it
were
a
wild
hen
his
host
answered
no
then
he
fell
on
heartily
and
afterwards
proceeded
on
his
journey
about
four
years
after
these
two
met
together
again
and
the
aforesaid
negro
being
not
yet
married
his
old
friend
asked
him
if
he
would
eat
a
wild
hen
to
which
he
answered
that
he
had
received
the
and
therefore
could
hereat
the
host
began
immediately
to
laugh
enquiring
of
him
what
made
him
refuse
it
now
when
he
had
eaten
one
at
his
table
about
four
years
ago
at
the
hearing
of
this
the
negro
immediately
fell
a
trembling
and
suffered
himself
to
be
so
far
possessed
with
the
effects
of
imagination
that
he
died
in
less
than
hours
mourners
tabooed
thus
regarding
his
sacred
chiefs
and
kings
as
charged
with
a
mysterious
spiritual
force
which
so
to
say
explodes
at
contact
the
savage
naturally
ranks
them
among
the
dangerous
classes
of
society
and
imposes
upon
them
the
same
sort
of
restraints
that
he
lays
on
manslayers
menstruous
women
and
other
persons
whom
he
looks
upon
with
a
certain
fear
and
horror
for
example
sacred
kings
and
priests
in
polynesia
were
not
allowed
to
touch
food
with
their
hands
and
had
therefore
to
be
fed
by
others
and
as
we
have
just
seen
their
vessels
garments
and
other
property
might
not
be
used
by
others
on
pain
of
disease
and
death
now
precisely
the
same
observances
are
exacted
by
some
savages
from
girls
at
their
first
menstruation
women
after
childbirth
homicides
mourners
and
all
persons
who
have
come
into
contact
with
the
dead
thus
for
example
to
begin
with
the
last
class
of
persons
among
the
maoris
any
one
who
had
handled
a
corpse
helped
to
convey
it
to
the
grave
or
touched
a
dead
man
s
bones
was
cut
off
from
all
intercourse
and
almost
all
communication
with
mankind
he
could
not
enter
any
house
or
come
into
contact
with
any
person
or
thing
without
utterly
bedevilling
them
he
might
not
even
touch
food
with
his
hands
which
had
become
so
frightfully
tabooed
or
unclean
as
to
be
quite
useless
food
would
be
set
for
him
on
the
ground
and
he
would
then
sit
or
kneel
down
and
with
his
hands
carefully
held
behind
his
back
would
gnaw
at
it
as
best
he
could
in
some
cases
he
would
be
fed
by
another
person
who
with
outstretched
arm
contrived
to
do
it
without
touching
the
tabooed
man
but
the
feeder
was
himself
subjected
to
many
severe
restrictions
little
less
onerous
than
those
which
were
imposed
upon
the
other
in
almost
every
populous
village
there
lived
a
degraded
wretch
the
lowest
of
the
low
who
earned
a
sorry
pittance
by
thus
waiting
upon
the
defiled
clad
in
rags
daubed
from
head
to
foot
with
red
ochre
and
stinking
shark
oil
always
solitary
and
silent
generally
old
haggard
and
wizened
often
half
crazed
he
might
be
seen
sitting
motionless
all
day
apart
from
the
common
path
or
thoroughfare
of
the
village
gazing
with
eyes
on
the
busy
doings
in
which
he
might
never
take
a
part
twice
a
day
a
dole
of
food
would
be
thrown
on
the
ground
before
him
to
munch
as
well
as
he
could
without
the
use
of
his
hands
and
at
night
huddling
his
greasy
tatters
about
him
he
would
crawl
into
some
miserable
lair
of
leaves
and
refuse
where
dirty
cold
and
hungry
he
passed
in
broken
slumbers
a
wretched
night
as
a
prelude
to
another
wretched
day
such
was
the
only
human
being
deemed
fit
to
associate
at
arm
s
length
with
one
who
had
paid
the
last
offices
of
respect
and
friendship
to
the
dead
and
when
the
dismal
term
of
his
seclusion
being
over
the
mourner
was
about
to
mix
with
his
fellows
once
more
all
the
dishes
he
had
used
in
his
seclusion
were
diligently
smashed
and
all
the
garments
he
had
worn
were
carefully
thrown
away
lest
they
should
spread
the
contagion
of
his
defilement
among
others
just
as
the
vessels
and
clothes
of
sacred
kings
and
chiefs
are
destroyed
or
cast
away
for
a
similar
reason
so
complete
in
these
respects
is
the
analogy
which
the
savage
traces
between
the
spiritual
influences
that
emanate
from
divinities
and
from
the
dead
between
the
odour
of
sanctity
and
the
stench
of
corruption
the
rule
which
forbids
persons
who
have
been
in
contact
with
the
dead
to
touch
food
with
their
hands
would
seem
to
have
been
universal
in
polynesia
thus
in
samoa
those
who
attended
the
deceased
were
most
careful
not
to
handle
food
and
for
days
were
fed
by
others
as
if
they
were
helpless
infants
baldness
and
the
loss
of
teeth
were
supposed
to
be
the
punishment
inflicted
by
the
household
god
if
they
violated
the
again
in
tonga
no
person
can
touch
a
dead
chief
without
being
taboo
d
for
ten
lunar
months
except
chiefs
who
are
only
taboo
d
for
three
four
or
five
months
according
to
the
superiority
of
the
dead
chief
except
again
it
be
the
body
of
tooitonga
the
great
divine
chief
and
then
even
the
greatest
chief
would
be
taboo
d
ten
months
as
was
the
case
with
finow
s
wife
above
mentioned
during
the
time
a
man
is
taboo
d
he
must
not
feed
himself
with
his
own
hands
but
must
be
fed
by
somebody
else
he
must
not
even
use
a
toothpick
himself
but
must
guide
another
person
s
hand
holding
the
toothpick
if
he
is
hungry
and
there
is
no
one
to
feed
him
he
must
go
down
upon
his
hands
and
knees
and
pick
up
his
victuals
with
his
mouth
and
if
he
infringes
upon
any
of
these
rules
it
is
firmly
expected
that
he
will
swell
up
and
die
and
this
belief
is
so
strong
that
mariner
thinks
no
native
ever
made
an
experiment
to
prove
the
contrary
they
often
saw
him
feed
himself
with
his
hands
after
having
touched
dead
chiefs
and
not
observing
his
health
to
decline
they
attributed
it
to
his
being
a
foreigner
and
being
governed
by
different
again
in
wallis
island
contact
with
a
corpse
subjects
the
hands
to
the
law
of
taboo
till
they
are
washed
which
is
not
done
for
several
weeks
until
that
purification
has
taken
place
the
tabooed
persons
may
not
themselves
put
food
to
their
mouths
other
people
render
them
that
a
rule
of
the
same
sort
is
or
was
observed
in
various
parts
of
melanesia
thus
in
fiji
the
taboo
for
handling
a
dead
chief
lasted
from
one
to
ten
months
according
to
his
rank
for
a
commoner
it
lasted
not
more
than
four
days
it
was
commonly
resorted
to
by
the
lazy
and
idle
for
during
the
time
of
their
seclusion
they
were
not
only
provided
with
food
but
were
actually
fed
by
attendants
or
ate
their
food
from
the
ground
similarly
in
the
motu
tribe
of
new
guinea
a
man
is
tabooed
generally
for
three
days
after
handling
a
corpse
and
while
the
taboo
lasts
he
may
not
touch
food
with
his
hands
at
the
end
of
the
time
he
bathes
and
the
taboo
is
over
so
in
new
caledonia
the
two
men
who
are
charged
with
the
duty
of
burying
and
guarding
a
corpse
have
to
remain
in
seclusion
and
observe
a
number
of
rules
of
abstinence
they
live
apart
from
their
wives
they
may
not
shave
or
cut
their
hair
their
food
is
laid
for
them
on
leaves
and
they
take
it
up
with
their
mouth
or
a
stick
but
oftener
an
attendant
feeds
them
just
as
he
might
feed
a
man
whose
limbs
were
palsied
so
among
the
nandi
of
british
east
africa
persons
who
have
handled
a
corpse
bathe
in
a
river
anoint
their
bodies
with
fat
partially
shave
their
heads
and
live
in
the
hut
of
the
deceased
for
four
days
all
these
days
they
may
not
be
seen
by
boys
or
women
they
may
not
drink
milk
and
they
may
not
touch
food
with
their
hands
but
must
eat
it
with
the
help
of
a
potsherd
or
chip
of
a
gourd
similarly
in
the
and
tribes
of
south
africa
men
who
have
dug
a
grave
may
not
touch
food
with
their
fingers
till
the
rites
of
their
purification
are
accomplished
meantime
they
eat
with
the
help
of
special
spoons
if
they
broke
this
rule
it
is
thought
that
they
would
be
consumptive
so
in
the
ngarigo
tribe
of
new
south
wales
a
novice
who
has
just
passed
through
the
ceremony
of
initiation
has
to
go
away
to
the
mountains
and
stay
there
for
a
while
sometimes
for
more
than
six
months
under
the
charge
of
one
or
more
old
men
and
all
the
time
of
his
absence
among
the
mountains
he
may
not
touch
cooked
food
with
his
hands
the
food
is
put
into
his
mouth
by
the
man
who
looks
after
him
among
the
shuswap
of
british
columbia
widows
and
widowers
in
mourning
are
secluded
and
forbidden
to
touch
their
own
head
or
body
the
cups
and
which
they
use
may
be
used
by
no
one
else
they
must
build
a
beside
a
creek
sweat
there
all
night
and
bathe
regularly
after
which
they
must
rub
their
bodies
with
branches
of
spruce
the
branches
may
not
be
used
more
than
once
and
when
they
have
served
their
purpose
they
are
stuck
into
the
ground
all
round
the
hut
no
hunter
would
come
near
such
mourners
for
their
presence
is
unlucky
if
their
shadow
were
to
fall
on
any
one
he
would
be
taken
ill
at
once
they
employ
thorn
bushes
for
bed
and
pillow
in
order
to
keep
away
the
ghost
of
the
deceased
and
thorn
bushes
are
also
laid
all
around
their
beds
this
last
precaution
shews
clearly
what
the
spiritual
danger
is
which
leads
to
the
exclusion
of
such
persons
from
ordinary
society
it
is
simply
a
fear
of
the
ghost
who
is
supposed
to
be
hovering
near
them
among
the
thompson
indians
of
british
columbia
the
persons
who
handled
a
corpse
and
dug
the
grave
were
secluded
for
four
days
they
fasted
until
the
body
was
buried
after
which
they
were
given
food
apart
from
the
other
people
they
would
not
touch
the
food
with
their
hands
but
must
put
it
into
their
mouths
with
sticks
they
ate
off
a
small
mat
and
drank
out
of
cups
which
together
with
the
mat
were
thrown
away
at
the
end
of
the
four
days
the
first
four
mouthfuls
of
food
as
well
as
of
water
had
to
be
spit
into
the
fire
during
their
seclusion
they
bathed
in
a
stream
and
might
not
sleep
with
their
wives
widows
and
widowers
were
obliged
to
observe
rules
of
a
similar
kind
immediately
after
the
death
they
went
out
and
passed
through
a
patch
of
four
times
probably
in
order
to
rid
themselves
of
the
ghost
who
might
be
supposed
to
stick
on
a
thorn
for
a
year
they
had
to
sleep
on
a
bed
of
on
which
sticks
of
were
laid
many
wore
twigs
of
and
juniper
in
a
piece
of
buckskin
on
their
persons
the
first
four
days
they
might
not
touch
their
food
but
ate
with
sticks
and
spat
out
the
first
four
mouthfuls
of
each
meal
and
the
first
four
of
water
into
the
fire
a
widower
might
not
fish
at
another
man
s
or
with
another
man
s
net
if
he
did
it
would
make
the
place
and
the
net
useless
for
the
season
if
he
transplanted
a
trout
into
another
lake
before
releasing
it
he
blew
on
the
head
of
the
fish
and
after
chewing
he
spat
some
of
the
grease
on
its
head
in
order
to
remove
the
baneful
effect
of
his
touch
then
he
let
the
trout
go
bidding
it
farewell
and
asking
it
to
propagate
its
kind
in
plenty
any
grass
or
branches
that
a
widow
or
widower
sat
or
lay
down
on
withered
up
if
a
widow
should
break
sticks
or
boughs
her
hands
or
arms
would
also
break
she
might
not
pick
berries
for
a
year
else
the
whole
crop
of
berries
would
fall
off
the
bushes
or
wither
up
she
might
not
cook
food
or
fetch
water
for
her
children
nor
let
them
lie
down
on
her
bed
nor
should
she
lie
or
sit
where
they
slept
sometimes
a
widow
would
wear
a
made
of
dry
for
several
days
to
prevent
her
husband
s
ghost
from
having
intercourse
with
her
among
the
tinneh
or
déné
indians
of
america
all
who
have
handled
a
corpse
are
subject
to
many
restrictions
and
taboos
they
are
debarred
for
a
certain
period
from
eating
any
fresh
meat
they
may
never
use
a
knife
to
cut
their
food
but
must
tear
it
with
their
teeth
they
may
not
drink
out
of
a
vessel
in
common
use
but
must
employ
a
gourd
which
they
carry
about
for
the
purpose
and
they
wear
peeled
willow
wands
about
their
arms
and
necks
or
carry
them
in
their
hands
as
disinfectants
to
annul
the
evil
consequences
which
are
supposed
to
follow
from
handling
the
dead
among
the
indian
tribes
of
queen
charlotte
sound
a
widow
or
widower
goes
into
special
mourning
for
a
month
among
the
koskimos
the
period
of
mourning
is
four
months
during
this
time
he
or
she
lives
apart
in
a
very
small
hut
behind
the
house
eating
and
drinking
alone
and
using
for
that
purpose
dishes
which
are
not
employed
by
other
members
of
the
tribe
among
the
agutainos
who
inhabit
palawan
one
of
the
philippine
islands
a
widow
may
not
leave
her
hut
for
seven
or
eight
days
after
the
death
and
even
then
she
may
only
go
out
at
an
hour
when
she
is
not
likely
to
meet
anybody
for
whoever
looks
upon
her
dies
a
sudden
death
to
prevent
this
fatal
catastrophe
the
widow
knocks
with
a
wooden
peg
on
the
trees
as
she
goes
along
thus
warning
people
of
her
dangerous
proximity
and
the
very
trees
on
which
she
knocks
soon
die
so
poisonous
is
the
atmosphere
of
death
that
surrounds
those
to
whom
the
ghost
of
the
departed
may
be
thought
to
cleave
in
the
mekeo
district
of
british
new
guinea
a
widower
loses
all
his
civil
rights
and
becomes
a
social
outcast
an
object
of
fear
and
horror
shunned
by
all
he
may
not
cultivate
a
garden
nor
shew
himself
in
public
nor
traverse
the
village
nor
walk
on
the
roads
and
paths
like
a
wild
beast
he
must
skulk
in
the
long
grass
and
the
bushes
and
if
he
sees
or
hears
any
one
coming
especially
a
woman
he
must
hide
behind
a
tree
or
a
thicket
if
he
wishes
to
fish
or
hunt
he
must
do
it
alone
and
at
night
if
he
would
consult
any
one
even
the
missionary
he
does
so
by
stealth
and
at
night
he
seems
to
have
lost
his
voice
and
speaks
only
in
whispers
were
he
to
join
a
party
of
fishers
or
hunters
his
presence
would
bring
misfortune
on
them
the
ghost
of
his
dead
wife
would
frighten
away
the
fish
or
the
game
he
goes
about
everywhere
and
at
all
times
armed
with
a
tomahawk
to
defend
himself
not
only
against
wild
boars
in
the
jungle
but
against
the
dreaded
spirit
of
his
departed
spouse
who
would
do
him
an
ill
turn
if
she
could
for
all
the
souls
of
the
dead
are
malignant
and
their
only
delight
is
to
harm
the
living
women
tabooed
at
menstruation
and
childbirth
in
general
we
may
say
that
the
prohibition
to
use
the
vessels
garments
and
so
on
of
certain
persons
and
the
effects
supposed
to
follow
an
infraction
of
the
rule
are
exactly
the
same
whether
the
persons
to
whom
the
things
belong
are
sacred
or
what
we
might
call
unclean
and
polluted
as
the
garments
which
have
been
touched
by
a
sacred
chief
kill
those
who
handle
them
so
do
the
things
which
have
been
touched
by
a
menstruous
woman
an
australian
blackfellow
who
discovered
that
his
wife
had
lain
on
his
blanket
at
her
menstrual
period
killed
her
and
died
of
terror
himself
within
a
fortnight
hence
australian
women
at
these
times
are
forbidden
under
pain
of
death
to
touch
anything
that
men
use
or
even
to
walk
on
a
path
that
any
man
frequents
they
are
also
secluded
at
childbirth
and
all
vessels
used
by
them
during
their
seclusion
are
burned
in
uganda
the
pots
which
a
woman
touches
while
the
impurity
of
childbirth
or
of
menstruation
is
on
her
should
be
destroyed
spears
and
shields
defiled
by
her
touch
are
not
destroyed
but
only
purified
no
esquimaux
of
alaska
will
willingly
drink
out
of
the
same
cup
or
eat
out
of
the
same
dish
that
has
been
used
by
a
woman
at
her
confinement
until
it
has
been
purified
by
certain
incantations
amongst
some
of
the
indians
of
north
america
women
at
menstruation
are
forbidden
to
touch
men
s
utensils
which
would
be
so
defiled
by
their
touch
that
their
subsequent
use
would
be
attended
by
certain
mischief
or
misfortune
for
instance
in
some
of
the
tinneh
or
déné
tribes
girls
verging
on
maturity
take
care
that
the
dishes
out
of
which
they
eat
are
used
by
no
one
else
when
their
first
periodical
sickness
comes
on
they
are
fed
by
their
mothers
or
nearest
kinswomen
and
will
on
no
account
touch
their
food
with
their
own
hands
at
the
same
time
they
abstain
from
touching
their
heads
with
their
hands
and
keep
a
small
stick
to
scratch
their
heads
with
when
they
itch
they
remain
outside
the
house
in
a
hut
built
for
the
purpose
and
wear
a
made
of
skin
to
fit
very
tight
which
they
never
lay
aside
till
the
first
monthly
infirmity
is
over
a
fringe
of
shells
bones
and
so
on
hangs
down
from
their
forehead
so
as
to
cover
their
eyes
lest
any
malicious
sorcerer
should
harm
them
during
this
critical
period
among
all
the
déné
and
most
other
american
tribes
hardly
any
other
being
was
the
object
of
so
much
dread
as
a
menstruating
woman
as
soon
as
signs
of
that
condition
made
themselves
apparent
in
a
young
girl
she
was
carefully
segregated
from
all
but
female
company
and
had
to
live
by
herself
in
a
small
hut
away
from
the
gaze
of
the
villagers
or
of
the
male
members
of
the
roving
band
while
in
that
awful
state
she
had
to
abstain
from
touching
anything
belonging
to
man
or
the
spoils
of
any
venison
or
other
animal
lest
she
would
thereby
pollute
the
same
and
condemn
the
hunters
to
failure
owing
to
the
anger
of
the
game
thus
slighted
dried
fish
formed
her
diet
and
cold
water
absorbed
through
a
drinking
tube
was
her
only
beverage
moreover
as
the
very
sight
of
her
was
dangerous
to
society
a
special
skin
bonnet
with
fringes
falling
over
her
face
down
to
her
breast
hid
her
from
the
public
gaze
even
some
time
after
she
had
recovered
her
normal
among
the
bribri
indians
of
costa
rica
a
menstruous
woman
is
regarded
as
unclean
the
only
plates
she
may
use
for
her
food
are
banana
leaves
which
when
she
has
done
with
them
she
throws
away
in
some
sequestered
spot
for
were
a
cow
to
find
them
and
eat
them
the
animal
would
waste
away
and
perish
and
she
drinks
out
of
a
special
vessel
for
a
like
reason
because
if
any
one
drank
out
of
the
same
cup
after
her
he
would
surely
die
in
the
islands
of
mabuiag
and
saibai
in
torres
straits
girls
at
their
first
menstruation
are
strictly
secluded
from
the
sight
of
men
in
mabuiag
the
seclusion
lasts
three
months
in
saibai
about
a
fortnight
during
the
time
of
her
separation
the
girl
is
forbidden
to
feed
herself
or
to
handle
food
which
is
put
into
her
mouth
by
women
or
girls
told
off
to
wait
on
her
among
many
peoples
similar
restrictions
are
imposed
on
women
in
childbed
and
apparently
for
similar
reasons
at
such
periods
women
are
supposed
to
be
in
a
dangerous
condition
which
would
infect
any
person
or
thing
they
might
touch
hence
they
are
put
into
quarantine
until
with
the
recovery
of
their
health
and
strength
the
imaginary
danger
has
passed
away
thus
in
tahiti
a
woman
after
childbirth
was
secluded
for
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
in
a
temporary
hut
erected
on
sacred
ground
during
the
time
of
her
seclusion
she
was
debarred
from
touching
provisions
and
had
to
be
fed
by
another
further
if
any
one
else
touched
the
child
at
this
period
he
was
subjected
to
the
same
restrictions
as
the
mother
until
the
ceremony
of
her
purification
had
been
performed
similarly
in
manahiki
an
island
of
the
southern
pacific
for
ten
days
after
her
delivery
a
woman
was
not
allowed
to
handle
food
and
had
to
be
fed
by
some
other
person
in
the
sinaugolo
tribe
of
british
new
guinea
for
about
a
month
after
her
confinement
a
woman
may
not
prepare
or
handle
food
she
may
not
even
cook
for
herself
and
when
she
is
eating
the
food
made
ready
for
her
by
her
friends
she
must
use
a
sharpened
stick
to
transfer
it
to
her
mouth
similarly
in
the
roro
and
mekeo
districts
of
british
new
guinea
a
woman
after
childbirth
becomes
for
a
time
taboo
and
any
person
or
thing
she
may
chance
to
touch
becomes
taboo
also
accordingly
during
this
time
she
abstains
from
cooking
for
were
she
to
cook
food
not
only
the
victuals
themselves
but
the
pot
and
the
fire
would
be
tabooed
so
that
nobody
could
eat
the
victuals
or
use
the
pot
or
warm
himself
at
the
fire
further
at
meals
she
may
not
dip
her
hand
into
the
dish
and
help
herself
as
the
natives
commonly
do
she
must
use
for
the
purpose
a
long
fork
with
which
she
takes
up
the
bananas
sweet
potatoes
yams
and
so
forth
in
order
not
to
contaminate
the
rest
of
the
food
in
the
vessel
by
the
touch
of
her
fingers
if
she
wishes
to
drink
a
gourd
is
set
before
her
and
wrapping
up
her
hands
in
a
cloth
or
fibre
she
pours
the
water
into
a
small
calabash
for
her
use
or
she
may
pour
the
water
directly
into
her
mouth
without
letting
the
gourd
touch
her
lips
if
anything
has
to
be
handed
to
her
it
is
not
given
from
hand
to
hand
but
reached
to
her
at
the
end
of
a
long
stick
similarly
in
the
island
of
kadiak
off
alaska
a
woman
about
to
be
delivered
retires
to
a
miserable
low
hovel
built
of
reeds
where
she
must
remain
for
twenty
days
after
the
birth
of
her
child
whatever
the
season
may
be
and
she
is
considered
so
unclean
that
no
one
will
touch
her
and
food
is
reached
to
her
on
sticks
in
the
and
tribes
of
south
africa
a
woman
in
childbed
may
not
touch
her
food
with
her
hands
all
the
time
of
her
seclusion
she
must
eat
with
the
help
of
a
wooden
spoon
they
think
that
if
she
touched
her
victuals
she
might
infect
them
with
her
bloody
flux
and
that
having
partaken
of
such
tainted
food
she
would
fall
into
a
consumption
the
bribri
indians
regard
the
pollution
of
childbed
as
much
more
dangerous
even
than
that
of
menstruation
when
a
woman
feels
her
time
approaching
she
informs
her
husband
who
makes
haste
to
build
a
hut
for
her
in
a
lonely
spot
there
she
must
live
alone
holding
no
converse
with
anybody
save
her
mother
or
another
woman
after
her
delivery
the
purifies
her
by
breathing
on
her
and
laying
an
animal
it
matters
not
what
upon
her
but
even
this
ceremony
only
mitigates
her
uncleanness
into
a
state
considered
to
be
equivalent
to
that
of
a
menstruous
woman
and
for
a
full
lunar
month
she
must
live
apart
from
her
housemates
observing
the
same
rules
with
regard
to
eating
and
drinking
as
at
her
monthly
periods
the
case
is
still
worse
the
pollution
is
still
more
deadly
if
she
has
had
a
miscarriage
or
has
been
delivered
of
a
stillborn
child
in
that
case
she
may
not
go
near
a
living
soul
the
mere
contact
with
things
she
has
used
is
exceedingly
dangerous
her
food
is
handed
to
her
at
the
end
of
a
long
stick
this
lasts
generally
for
three
weeks
after
which
she
may
go
home
subject
only
to
the
restrictions
incident
to
an
ordinary
confinement
among
the
adivi
or
forest
gollas
of
southern
india
when
a
woman
feels
the
first
pains
of
labour
she
is
turned
clean
out
of
the
village
and
must
take
up
her
quarters
in
a
little
hut
made
of
leaves
or
mats
about
two
hundred
yards
away
in
this
hut
she
must
bring
forth
her
offspring
unaided
unless
a
midwife
can
be
fetched
in
time
to
be
with
her
before
the
child
is
born
if
the
midwife
arrives
after
the
birth
has
taken
place
she
may
not
go
near
the
woman
for
ninety
days
the
mother
lives
in
the
hut
by
herself
if
any
one
touches
her
he
or
she
becomes
like
the
mother
herself
an
outcast
and
is
expelled
from
the
village
for
three
months
the
woman
s
husband
generally
makes
a
little
hut
about
fifty
yards
from
hers
and
stays
in
it
sometimes
to
watch
over
her
but
he
may
not
go
near
her
on
pain
of
being
an
outcast
for
three
months
food
is
placed
on
the
ground
near
the
woman
s
hut
and
she
takes
it
on
the
fourth
day
after
the
birth
a
woman
of
the
village
goes
to
her
and
pours
water
on
her
but
may
not
come
into
contact
with
her
on
the
fifth
day
the
villagers
clear
away
the
stones
and
thorny
bushes
from
a
patch
of
ground
about
ten
yards
on
the
village
side
of
the
hut
and
to
this
clearing
the
woman
removes
her
hut
unaided
no
one
may
help
her
to
do
so
on
the
ninth
fifteenth
and
thirtieth
days
she
again
shifts
her
hut
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
village
and
again
once
in
each
of
the
two
following
months
she
brings
her
hut
still
nearer
on
the
ninetieth
day
of
her
seclusion
the
woman
is
called
out
from
her
hut
washed
clad
in
clean
clothes
and
after
being
taken
to
the
village
temple
is
conducted
to
her
own
house
by
a
man
of
the
caste
who
performs
purificatory
ceremonies
these
customs
shew
that
in
the
opinion
of
some
primitive
peoples
a
woman
at
and
after
childbirth
is
pervaded
by
a
certain
dangerous
influence
which
can
infect
anything
and
anybody
she
touches
so
that
in
the
interest
of
the
community
it
becomes
necessary
to
seclude
her
from
society
for
a
while
until
the
virulence
of
the
infection
has
passed
away
when
after
submitting
to
certain
rites
of
purification
she
is
again
free
to
mingle
with
her
fellows
this
dread
of
women
appears
to
be
widespread
for
the
practice
of
shutting
them
up
at
such
times
in
lonely
huts
away
from
the
rest
of
the
people
is
very
common
sometimes
the
nature
of
the
danger
which
is
apprehended
from
them
is
explicitly
stated
thus
in
the
island
of
tumleo
off
german
new
guinea
after
the
birth
of
her
first
child
a
woman
is
shut
up
with
her
infant
for
five
to
eight
days
during
which
no
man
not
even
her
husband
may
see
her
for
the
men
think
that
were
they
to
see
her
their
bodies
would
swell
up
and
they
would
die
apparently
their
notion
is
that
the
sight
of
a
woman
who
has
just
been
big
with
child
will
on
the
principles
of
homoeopathic
magic
make
their
bodies
big
also
to
bursting
the
sulka
of
new
britain
imagine
that
when
a
woman
has
been
delivered
of
a
child
the
men
become
cowardly
weapons
lose
their
force
and
the
slips
which
are
to
be
planted
out
are
deprived
of
their
power
of
germinating
hence
they
perform
a
ceremony
which
is
intended
to
counteract
this
mysterious
influence
on
men
and
plants
as
soon
as
it
is
known
that
a
woman
has
been
brought
to
bed
all
the
male
population
of
the
village
assembles
in
the
men
s
clubhouse
branches
of
a
tree
are
fetched
the
twigs
are
broken
off
the
leaves
stripped
off
and
put
on
the
fire
all
the
men
present
then
seize
branches
with
young
buds
one
of
them
holds
ginger
in
his
hand
which
after
reciting
a
spell
over
it
he
distributes
to
the
others
they
chew
it
and
spit
it
out
on
the
twigs
and
these
twigs
are
afterwards
laid
on
the
shields
and
other
weapons
in
the
house
and
also
on
the
slips
which
are
to
be
planted
moreover
they
are
fastened
on
the
roofs
and
over
the
doorways
of
the
houses
in
this
way
they
seek
to
annul
the
noxious
infection
of
childbirth
among
the
yabim
of
german
new
guinea
when
a
birth
has
taken
place
in
the
village
all
the
inhabitants
remain
at
home
next
morning
in
order
that
the
fruits
of
the
field
may
not
be
apparently
they
fear
that
if
they
went
out
to
their
fields
and
gardens
immediately
after
a
woman
had
been
brought
to
bed
they
would
carry
with
them
a
dangerous
contagion
which
might
blight
the
crops
when
a
herero
woman
has
given
birth
to
a
child
her
female
companions
hastily
construct
a
special
hut
for
her
to
which
she
is
transferred
both
the
hut
and
the
woman
are
sacred
and
for
this
reason
the
men
are
not
allowed
to
see
the
woman
until
the
navel
string
has
separated
from
the
child
otherwise
they
would
become
weaklings
and
when
later
they
that
is
go
to
war
with
spear
and
bow
they
would
be
thus
the
herero
like
the
sulka
appear
to
imagine
that
the
weakness
of
a
woman
can
on
the
principles
of
homoeopathic
magic
infect
any
men
who
may
chance
to
see
her
among
the
saragacos
indians
of
eastern
ecuador
as
soon
as
a
woman
feels
the
beginning
she
retires
into
the
forest
to
a
distance
of
three
or
four
leagues
from
her
home
where
she
takes
up
her
abode
in
a
hut
of
leaves
which
has
been
already
prepared
for
her
this
banishment
we
are
told
is
the
fruit
of
the
superstition
of
these
indians
who
are
persuaded
that
the
spirit
of
evil
would
attach
himself
to
their
house
if
the
women
were
brought
to
bed
in
the
esquimaux
of
baffin
land
think
that
the
body
of
a
woman
exhales
a
vapour
which
would
adhere
to
the
souls
of
seals
if
she
ate
the
flesh
of
any
seals
except
such
as
have
been
caught
by
her
husband
by
a
boy
or
by
an
aged
man
cases
of
premature
birth
require
particularly
careful
treatment
the
event
must
be
announced
publicly
else
dire
results
will
follow
if
a
woman
should
conceal
from
the
other
people
that
she
has
had
a
premature
birth
they
might
come
near
her
or
even
eat
in
her
hut
of
the
seals
procured
by
her
husband
the
vapor
arising
from
her
would
thus
affect
them
and
they
would
be
avoided
by
the
seals
the
transgression
would
also
become
attached
to
the
soul
of
the
seal
which
would
take
it
down
to
sedna
the
mythical
mother
of
the
who
lives
in
the
lower
world
and
controls
the
destinies
of
mankind
some
bantu
tribes
of
south
africa
entertain
even
more
exaggerated
notions
of
the
virulent
infection
spread
by
a
woman
who
has
had
a
miscarriage
and
has
concealed
it
an
experienced
observer
of
these
people
tells
us
that
the
blood
of
childbirth
appears
to
the
eyes
of
the
south
africans
to
be
tainted
with
a
pollution
still
more
dangerous
than
that
of
the
menstrual
fluid
the
husband
is
excluded
from
the
hut
for
eight
days
of
the
period
chiefly
from
fear
that
he
might
be
contaminated
by
this
secretion
he
dare
not
take
his
child
in
his
arms
for
the
three
first
months
after
the
birth
but
the
secretion
of
childbed
is
particularly
terrible
when
it
is
the
product
of
a
miscarriage
especially
concealed
in
this
case
it
is
not
merely
the
man
who
is
threatened
or
killed
it
is
the
whole
country
it
is
the
sky
itself
which
suffers
by
a
curious
association
of
ideas
a
physiological
fact
causes
cosmic
troubles
thus
for
example
the
believe
that
a
woman
who
has
procured
abortion
can
kill
a
man
merely
by
lying
with
him
her
victim
is
poisoned
shrivels
up
and
dies
within
a
week
as
for
the
disastrous
effect
which
a
miscarriage
may
have
on
the
whole
country
i
will
quote
the
words
of
a
and
of
the
tribe
when
a
woman
has
had
a
miscarriage
when
she
has
allowed
her
blood
to
flow
and
has
hidden
the
child
it
is
enough
to
cause
the
burning
winds
to
blow
and
to
parch
the
country
with
heat
the
rain
no
longer
falls
for
the
country
is
no
longer
in
order
when
the
rain
approaches
the
place
where
the
blood
is
it
will
not
dare
to
approach
it
will
fear
and
remain
at
a
distance
that
woman
has
committed
a
great
fault
she
has
spoiled
the
country
of
the
chief
for
she
has
hidden
blood
which
had
not
yet
been
well
congealed
to
fashion
a
man
that
blood
is
taboo
it
should
never
drip
on
the
road
the
chief
will
assemble
his
men
and
say
to
them
are
you
in
order
in
your
villages
some
one
will
answer
such
and
such
a
woman
was
pregnant
and
we
have
not
yet
seen
the
child
which
she
has
given
birth
then
they
go
and
arrest
the
woman
they
say
to
her
shew
us
where
you
have
hidden
they
go
and
dig
at
the
spot
they
sprinkle
the
hole
with
a
decoction
of
and
two
sorts
of
roots
prepared
in
a
special
pot
they
take
a
little
of
the
earth
of
this
grave
they
throw
it
into
the
river
then
they
bring
back
water
from
the
river
and
sprinkle
it
where
she
shed
her
blood
she
herself
must
wash
every
day
with
the
medicine
then
the
country
will
be
moistened
again
by
rain
further
we
summon
the
women
of
the
country
we
tell
them
to
prepare
a
ball
of
the
earth
which
contains
the
blood
they
bring
it
to
us
one
morning
if
we
wish
to
prepare
medicine
with
which
to
sprinkle
the
whole
country
we
crumble
this
earth
to
powder
at
the
end
of
five
days
we
send
little
boys
and
little
girls
girls
that
yet
know
nothing
of
women
s
affairs
and
have
not
yet
had
relations
with
men
we
put
the
medicine
in
the
horns
of
oxen
and
these
children
go
to
all
the
fords
to
all
the
entrances
of
the
country
a
little
girl
turns
up
the
soil
with
her
mattock
the
others
dip
a
branch
in
the
horn
and
sprinkle
the
inside
of
the
hole
saying
rain
rain
so
we
remove
the
misfortune
which
the
women
have
brought
on
the
roads
the
rain
will
be
able
to
come
the
country
is
purified
similarly
the
another
bantu
tribe
of
south
africa
in
the
valley
of
the
limpopo
river
attribute
severe
droughts
to
the
concealment
of
miscarriages
by
women
and
they
perform
the
following
rites
to
remove
the
pollution
and
procure
rain
a
small
clearing
is
made
in
a
thick
and
thorny
wood
and
here
a
pot
is
buried
in
the
ground
so
that
its
mouth
is
flush
with
the
surface
from
the
pot
four
channels
run
in
the
form
of
a
cross
to
the
four
cardinal
points
of
the
horizon
then
a
black
ox
or
a
black
ram
without
a
speck
of
white
on
it
is
killed
and
the
pot
is
stuffed
with
the
grass
found
in
the
animal
s
stomach
next
little
girls
still
in
the
age
of
innocence
are
sent
to
draw
water
which
they
pour
into
the
pot
till
it
overflows
into
the
four
channels
after
that
the
women
assemble
strip
off
their
clothes
and
covering
their
nakedness
only
with
a
scanty
petticoat
of
grass
they
dance
leap
and
sing
rain
fall
then
they
go
and
dig
up
the
remains
of
the
prematurely
born
infants
and
of
twins
buried
in
dry
ground
on
a
hill
these
they
collect
in
one
place
no
man
may
approach
the
spot
the
women
would
beat
any
male
who
might
be
so
indiscreet
as
to
intrude
on
their
privacy
and
they
would
put
riddles
to
him
which
he
would
have
to
answer
in
the
most
filthy
language
borrowed
from
the
circumcision
ceremonies
for
obscene
words
which
are
usually
forbidden
are
customary
and
legitimate
on
these
occasions
the
women
pour
water
on
the
graves
of
the
infants
and
of
twins
in
order
to
extinguish
them
as
the
natives
phrase
it
which
seems
to
imply
that
the
graves
are
thought
to
be
the
source
of
the
scorching
heat
which
is
blasting
the
country
at
the
fall
of
evening
they
bury
all
the
remains
they
have
discovered
poking
them
away
in
the
mud
near
a
stream
then
the
rain
will
be
free
to
fall
in
these
ceremonies
the
pouring
of
water
into
channels
which
run
in
the
direction
of
the
four
quarters
of
the
heaven
is
clearly
a
charm
based
on
the
principles
of
homoeopathic
magic
to
procure
rain
the
supposed
influence
of
twins
over
the
waters
of
heaven
and
the
use
of
foul
language
at
ceremonies
have
been
illustrated
in
another
part
of
this
work
among
the
natives
of
the
nguôn
so
n
valley
in
annam
during
the
first
month
after
a
woman
has
been
delivered
of
a
child
all
the
persons
of
the
house
are
supposed
to
be
affected
with
an
evil
destiny
or
ill
luck
called
if
a
member
of
such
a
household
enters
another
house
the
inmates
never
fail
to
say
to
him
you
bring
me
the
should
a
member
of
a
family
in
which
somebody
is
seriously
ill
have
to
enter
a
house
infected
by
the
on
returning
home
he
always
fumigates
himself
with
tea
leaves
or
some
other
plant
in
order
to
rid
himself
of
the
infection
which
he
has
contracted
for
they
fear
that
the
blood
of
the
woman
who
has
been
brought
to
bed
may
harm
the
patient
all
the
time
a
house
is
tainted
with
the
a
branch
of
cactus
or
pandanus
is
hung
at
the
door
the
same
thing
is
done
to
a
house
infected
by
it
is
a
danger
signal
to
warn
people
off
the
only
disappears
when
the
woman
has
gone
to
market
for
the
first
time
after
her
delivery
a
trace
of
a
similar
belief
in
the
dangerous
infection
of
childbirth
may
be
seen
in
the
rule
of
ancient
greek
religion
which
forbade
persons
who
had
handled
a
corpse
or
been
in
contact
with
a
woman
to
enter
a
temple
or
approach
an
altar
for
a
certain
time
sometimes
for
two
days
restrictions
and
taboos
like
those
laid
on
menstruous
and
women
are
imposed
by
some
savages
on
lads
at
the
initiatory
rites
which
celebrate
the
attainment
of
puberty
hence
we
may
infer
that
at
such
times
young
men
are
supposed
to
be
in
a
state
like
that
of
women
at
menstruation
and
in
childbed
thus
among
the
creek
indians
a
lad
at
initiation
had
to
abstain
for
twelve
moons
from
picking
his
ears
or
scratching
his
head
with
his
fingers
he
had
to
use
a
small
stick
for
these
purposes
for
four
moons
he
must
have
a
fire
of
his
own
to
cook
his
food
at
and
a
little
girl
a
virgin
might
cook
for
him
during
the
fifth
moon
any
person
might
cook
for
him
but
he
must
serve
himself
first
and
use
one
spoon
and
pan
on
the
fifth
day
of
the
twelfth
moon
he
gathered
corn
cobs
burned
them
to
ashes
and
with
the
ashes
rubbed
his
body
all
over
at
the
end
of
the
twelfth
moon
he
sweated
under
blankets
and
then
bathed
in
water
which
ended
the
ceremony
while
the
ceremonies
lasted
he
might
touch
no
one
but
lads
who
were
undergoing
a
like
course
of
initiation
caffre
boys
at
circumcision
live
secluded
in
a
special
hut
they
are
smeared
from
head
to
foot
with
white
clay
they
wear
tall
with
projections
and
short
skirts
like
those
of
when
their
wounds
are
healed
all
the
vessels
which
they
had
used
during
their
seclusion
and
the
boyish
mantles
which
they
had
hitherto
worn
are
burned
together
with
the
hut
and
the
boys
rush
away
from
the
burning
hut
without
looking
back
lest
a
fearful
curse
should
cling
to
after
that
they
are
bathed
anointed
and
clad
in
new
garments
warriors
tabooed
once
more
warriors
are
conceived
by
the
savage
to
move
so
to
say
in
an
atmosphere
of
spiritual
danger
which
constrains
them
to
practise
a
variety
of
superstitious
observances
quite
different
in
their
nature
from
those
rational
precautions
which
as
a
matter
of
course
they
adopt
against
foes
of
flesh
and
blood
the
general
effect
of
these
observances
is
to
place
the
warrior
both
before
and
after
victory
in
the
same
state
of
seclusion
or
spiritual
quarantine
in
which
for
his
own
safety
primitive
man
puts
his
human
gods
and
other
dangerous
characters
thus
when
the
maoris
went
out
on
the
they
were
sacred
or
taboo
in
the
highest
degree
and
they
and
their
friends
at
home
had
to
observe
strictly
many
curious
customs
over
and
above
the
numerous
taboos
of
ordinary
life
they
became
in
the
irreverent
language
of
europeans
who
knew
them
in
the
old
fighting
days
tabooed
an
inch
thick
and
as
for
the
leader
of
the
expedition
he
was
quite
unapproachable
similarly
when
the
israelites
marched
forth
to
war
they
were
bound
by
certain
rules
of
ceremonial
purity
identical
with
rules
observed
by
maoris
and
australian
blackfellows
on
the
the
vessels
they
used
were
sacred
and
they
had
to
practise
continence
and
a
custom
of
personal
cleanliness
of
which
the
original
motive
if
we
may
judge
from
the
avowed
motive
of
savages
who
conform
to
the
same
custom
was
a
fear
lest
the
enemy
should
obtain
the
refuse
of
their
persons
and
thus
be
enabled
to
work
their
destruction
by
magic
among
some
indian
tribes
of
north
america
a
young
warrior
in
his
first
campaign
had
to
conform
to
certain
customs
of
which
two
were
identical
with
the
observances
imposed
by
the
same
indians
on
girls
at
their
first
menstruation
the
vessels
he
ate
and
drank
out
of
might
be
touched
by
no
other
person
and
he
was
forbidden
to
scratch
his
head
or
any
other
part
of
his
body
with
his
fingers
if
he
could
not
help
scratching
himself
he
had
to
do
it
with
a
stick
the
latter
rule
like
the
one
which
forbids
a
tabooed
person
to
feed
himself
with
his
own
fingers
seems
to
rest
on
the
supposed
sanctity
or
pollution
whichever
we
choose
to
call
it
of
the
tabooed
hands
moreover
among
these
indian
tribes
the
men
on
the
had
always
to
sleep
at
night
with
their
faces
turned
towards
their
own
country
however
uneasy
the
posture
they
might
not
change
it
they
might
not
sit
upon
the
bare
ground
nor
wet
their
feet
nor
walk
on
a
beaten
path
if
they
could
help
it
when
they
had
no
choice
but
to
walk
on
a
path
they
sought
to
counteract
the
ill
effect
of
doing
so
by
doctoring
their
legs
with
certain
medicines
or
charms
which
they
carried
with
them
for
the
purpose
no
member
of
the
party
was
permitted
to
step
over
the
legs
hands
or
body
of
any
other
member
who
chanced
to
be
sitting
or
lying
on
the
ground
and
it
was
equally
forbidden
to
step
over
his
blanket
gun
tomahawk
or
anything
that
belonged
to
him
if
this
rule
was
inadvertently
broken
it
became
the
duty
of
the
member
whose
person
or
property
had
been
stepped
over
to
knock
the
other
member
down
and
it
was
similarly
the
duty
of
that
other
to
be
knocked
down
peaceably
and
without
resistance
the
vessels
out
of
which
the
warriors
ate
their
food
were
commonly
small
bowls
of
wood
or
birch
bark
with
marks
to
distinguish
the
two
sides
in
marching
from
home
the
indians
invariably
drank
out
of
one
side
of
the
bowl
and
in
returning
they
drank
out
of
the
other
when
on
their
way
home
they
came
within
a
day
s
march
of
the
village
they
hung
up
all
their
bowls
on
trees
or
threw
them
away
on
the
prairie
doubtless
to
prevent
their
sanctity
or
defilement
from
being
communicated
with
disastrous
effects
to
their
friends
just
as
we
have
seen
that
the
vessels
and
clothes
of
the
sacred
mikado
of
women
at
childbirth
and
menstruation
of
boys
at
circumcision
and
of
persons
defiled
by
contact
with
the
dead
are
destroyed
or
laid
aside
for
a
similar
reason
the
first
four
times
that
an
apache
indian
goes
out
on
the
he
is
bound
to
refrain
from
scratching
his
head
with
his
fingers
and
from
letting
water
touch
his
lips
hence
he
scratches
his
head
with
a
stick
and
drinks
through
a
hollow
reed
or
cane
stick
and
reed
are
attached
to
the
warrior
s
belt
and
to
each
other
by
a
leathern
thong
the
rule
not
to
scratch
their
heads
with
their
fingers
but
to
use
a
stick
for
the
purpose
instead
was
regularly
observed
by
ojebways
on
the
for
three
or
four
weeks
before
they
went
on
a
warlike
expedition
the
nootka
indians
made
it
an
invariable
rule
to
go
into
the
water
five
or
six
times
a
day
when
they
washed
and
scrubbed
themselves
from
head
to
foot
with
bushes
intermixed
with
briars
so
that
their
bodies
and
faces
were
often
entirely
covered
with
blood
during
this
severe
exercise
they
continually
exclaimed
good
or
great
god
let
me
live
not
be
sick
find
the
enemy
not
fear
him
find
him
asleep
and
kill
a
great
many
of
all
this
time
they
had
no
intercourse
with
their
women
and
for
a
week
before
setting
out
abstained
from
feasting
and
every
kind
of
merriment
for
the
last
three
days
they
were
almost
constantly
in
the
water
scrubbing
and
lacerating
themselves
in
a
terrible
manner
they
believed
that
this
hardened
their
skin
so
that
the
weapons
of
the
enemy
could
not
pierce
them
before
they
went
out
on
the
the
arikaras
and
the
big
belly
indians
observe
a
rigorous
fast
or
rather
abstain
from
every
kind
of
food
for
four
days
in
this
interval
their
imagination
is
exalted
to
delirium
whether
it
be
through
bodily
weakness
or
the
natural
effect
of
the
warlike
plans
they
cherish
they
pretend
to
have
strange
visions
the
elders
and
sages
of
the
tribe
being
called
upon
to
interpret
these
dreams
draw
from
them
omens
more
or
less
favourable
to
the
success
of
the
enterprise
and
their
explanations
are
received
as
oracles
by
which
the
expedition
will
be
faithfully
regulated
so
long
as
the
preparatory
fast
continues
the
warriors
make
incisions
in
their
bodies
insert
pieces
of
wood
in
the
flesh
and
having
fastened
leather
thongs
to
them
cause
themselves
to
be
hung
from
a
beam
which
is
fixed
horizontally
above
an
abyss
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
deep
often
indeed
they
cut
off
one
or
two
fingers
which
they
offer
in
sacrifice
to
the
great
spirit
in
order
that
they
may
come
back
laden
with
it
is
hard
to
conceive
any
course
of
training
which
could
more
effectually
incapacitate
men
for
the
business
of
war
than
that
which
these
foolish
indians
actually
adopted
with
regard
to
the
creek
indians
and
kindred
tribes
we
are
told
they
will
not
cohabit
with
women
while
they
are
out
at
war
they
religiously
abstain
from
every
kind
of
intercourse
even
with
their
own
wives
for
the
space
of
three
days
and
nights
before
they
go
to
war
and
so
after
they
return
home
because
they
are
to
sanctify
and
as
a
preparation
for
attacking
the
enemy
they
go
to
the
aforesaid
winter
house
and
there
drink
a
warm
decoction
of
their
supposed
holy
consecrated
herbs
and
roots
for
three
days
and
nights
sometimes
without
any
other
refreshment
this
is
to
induce
the
deity
to
guard
and
prosper
them
amidst
their
impending
dangers
in
the
most
promising
appearance
of
things
they
are
not
to
take
the
least
nourishment
of
food
nor
so
much
as
to
sit
down
during
that
time
of
sanctifying
themselves
till
after
sunset
while
on
their
expedition
they
are
not
allowed
to
lean
themselves
against
a
tree
though
they
may
be
exceedingly
fatigued
after
a
sharp
day
s
march
nor
must
they
lie
by
a
whole
day
to
refresh
themselves
or
kill
and
barbicue
deer
and
bear
for
their
war
journey
the
more
virtuous
they
are
they
reckon
the
greater
will
be
their
success
against
the
enemy
by
the
bountiful
smiles
of
the
deity
to
gain
that
favourite
point
some
of
the
aged
warriors
narrowly
watch
the
young
men
who
are
newly
initiated
lest
they
should
prove
irreligious
and
prophane
the
holy
fast
and
bring
misfortunes
on
the
camp
a
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
in
his
youthful
days
observed
one
of
their
religious
fasts
but
under
the
greatest
suspicion
of
his
virtue
in
this
respect
though
he
had
often
headed
them
against
the
common
enemy
during
their
three
days
purification
he
was
not
allowed
to
go
out
of
the
sanctified
ground
without
a
trusty
guard
lest
hunger
should
have
tempted
him
to
violate
their
old
martial
law
and
by
that
means
have
raised
the
burning
wrath
of
the
holy
fire
against
the
whole
every
war
captain
chuses
a
noted
warrior
to
attend
on
him
and
the
company
he
is
called
or
the
everything
they
eat
or
drink
during
their
journey
he
gives
them
out
of
his
hand
by
a
rigid
abstemious
rule
each
carries
on
his
back
all
his
travelling
conveniencies
wrapt
in
a
deer
skin
yet
they
are
so
bigoted
in
their
religious
customs
in
war
that
none
though
prompted
by
sharp
hunger
or
burning
thirst
dares
relieve
himself
they
are
contented
with
such
trifling
allowance
as
the
religious
waiter
distributes
to
them
even
with
a
scanty
hand
such
a
regimen
would
be
too
mortifying
to
any
of
the
white
people
let
their
opinion
of
its
violation
be
ever
so
dangerous
when
i
roved
the
woods
in
a
war
party
with
the
indians
though
i
carried
no
scrip
nor
bottle
nor
staff
i
kept
a
large
hollow
cane
well
corked
at
each
end
and
used
to
sheer
off
now
and
then
to
drink
while
they
suffered
greatly
by
thirst
the
constancy
of
the
savages
in
mortifying
their
bodies
to
gain
the
divine
favour
is
astonishing
from
the
very
time
they
beat
to
arms
till
they
return
from
their
campaign
all
the
while
they
are
out
they
are
prohibited
by
ancient
custom
the
leaning
against
a
tree
either
sitting
or
standing
nor
are
they
allowed
to
sit
in
the
under
the
shade
of
trees
if
it
can
be
avoided
nor
on
the
ground
during
the
whole
journey
but
on
such
rocks
stones
or
fallen
wood
as
their
ark
of
war
rests
upon
by
the
attention
they
invariably
pay
to
those
severe
rules
of
living
they
weaken
themselves
much
more
than
by
the
unavoidable
fatigues
of
war
but
it
is
fruitless
to
endeavour
to
dissuade
them
from
those
things
which
they
have
by
tradition
as
the
appointed
means
to
move
the
deity
to
grant
them
success
against
the
enemy
and
a
safe
return
an
indian
intending
to
go
to
war
will
commence
by
blacking
his
face
permitting
his
hair
to
grow
long
and
neglecting
his
personal
appearance
and
also
will
frequently
fast
sometimes
for
two
or
three
days
together
and
refrain
from
all
intercourse
with
the
other
sex
if
his
dreams
are
favorable
he
thinks
that
the
great
spirit
will
give
him
among
the
and
tribes
of
south
africa
not
only
have
the
warriors
to
abstain
from
women
but
the
people
left
behind
in
the
villages
are
also
bound
to
continence
they
think
that
any
incontinence
on
their
part
would
cause
thorns
to
grow
on
the
ground
traversed
by
the
warriors
and
that
success
would
not
attend
the
expedition
when
we
observe
what
pains
these
misguided
savages
took
to
unfit
themselves
for
the
business
of
war
by
abstaining
from
food
denying
themselves
rest
and
lacerating
their
bodies
we
shall
probably
not
be
disposed
to
attribute
their
practice
of
continence
in
war
to
a
rational
fear
of
dissipating
their
bodily
energies
by
indulgence
in
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
on
the
contrary
we
can
scarcely
doubt
that
the
motive
which
impelled
them
to
observe
chastity
on
a
campaign
was
just
as
frivolous
as
the
motive
which
led
them
simultaneously
to
fritter
away
their
strength
by
severe
fasts
gratuitous
fatigue
and
voluntary
wounds
at
the
very
moment
when
prudence
called
most
loudly
for
a
precisely
opposite
regimen
why
exactly
so
many
savages
have
made
it
a
rule
to
refrain
from
women
in
time
of
war
we
can
not
say
for
certain
but
we
may
conjecture
that
their
motive
was
a
superstitious
fear
lest
on
the
principles
of
sympathetic
magic
close
contact
with
women
should
infect
them
with
feminine
weakness
and
cowardice
similarly
some
savages
imagine
that
contact
with
a
woman
in
childbed
enervates
warriors
and
enfeebles
their
weapons
indeed
the
kayans
of
central
borneo
go
so
far
as
to
hold
that
to
touch
a
loom
or
women
s
clothes
would
so
weaken
a
man
that
he
would
have
no
success
in
hunting
fishing
and
war
hence
it
is
not
merely
sexual
intercourse
with
women
that
the
savage
warrior
sometimes
shuns
he
is
careful
to
avoid
the
sex
altogether
thus
among
the
hill
tribes
of
assam
not
only
are
men
forbidden
to
cohabit
with
their
wives
during
or
after
a
raid
but
they
may
not
eat
food
cooked
by
a
woman
nay
they
should
not
address
a
word
even
to
their
own
wives
once
a
woman
who
unwittingly
broke
the
rule
by
speaking
to
her
husband
while
he
was
under
the
war
taboo
sickened
and
died
when
she
learned
the
awful
crime
she
had
committed
manslayers
tabooed
if
the
reader
still
doubts
whether
the
rules
of
conduct
which
we
have
just
been
considering
are
based
on
superstitious
fears
or
dictated
by
a
rational
prudence
his
doubts
will
probably
be
dissipated
when
he
learns
that
rules
of
the
same
sort
are
often
imposed
even
more
stringently
on
warriors
after
the
victory
has
been
won
and
when
all
fear
of
the
living
corporeal
foe
is
at
an
end
in
such
cases
one
motive
for
the
inconvenient
restrictions
laid
on
the
victors
in
their
hour
of
triumph
is
probably
a
dread
of
the
angry
ghosts
of
the
slain
and
that
the
fear
of
the
vengeful
ghosts
does
influence
the
behaviour
of
the
slayers
is
often
expressly
affirmed
the
general
effect
of
the
taboos
laid
on
sacred
chiefs
mourners
women
at
childbirth
men
on
the
and
so
on
is
to
seclude
or
isolate
the
tabooed
persons
from
ordinary
society
this
effect
being
attained
by
a
variety
of
rules
which
oblige
the
men
or
women
to
live
in
separate
huts
or
in
the
open
air
to
shun
the
commerce
of
the
sexes
to
avoid
the
use
of
vessels
employed
by
others
and
so
forth
now
the
same
effect
is
produced
by
similar
means
in
the
case
of
victorious
warriors
particularly
such
as
have
actually
shed
the
blood
of
their
enemies
in
the
island
of
timor
when
a
warlike
expedition
has
returned
in
triumph
bringing
the
heads
of
the
vanquished
foe
the
leader
of
the
expedition
is
forbidden
by
religion
and
custom
to
return
at
once
to
his
own
house
a
special
hut
is
prepared
for
him
in
which
he
has
to
reside
for
two
months
undergoing
bodily
and
spiritual
purification
during
this
time
he
may
not
go
to
his
wife
nor
feed
himself
the
food
must
be
put
into
his
mouth
by
another
person
that
these
observances
are
dictated
by
fear
of
the
ghosts
of
the
slain
seems
certain
for
from
another
account
of
the
ceremonies
performed
on
the
return
of
a
successful
in
the
same
island
we
learn
that
sacrifices
are
offered
on
this
occasion
to
appease
the
soul
of
the
man
whose
head
has
been
taken
the
people
think
that
some
misfortune
would
befall
the
victor
were
such
offerings
omitted
moreover
a
part
of
the
ceremony
consists
of
a
dance
accompanied
by
a
song
in
which
the
death
of
the
slain
man
is
lamented
and
his
forgiveness
is
entreated
be
not
angry
they
say
because
your
head
is
here
with
us
had
we
been
less
lucky
our
heads
might
now
have
been
exposed
in
your
village
we
have
offered
the
sacrifice
to
appease
you
your
spirit
may
now
rest
and
leave
us
at
peace
why
were
you
our
enemy
would
it
not
have
been
better
that
we
should
remain
friends
then
your
blood
would
not
have
been
spilt
and
your
head
would
not
have
been
cut
the
people
of
paloo
in
central
celebes
take
the
heads
of
their
enemies
in
war
and
afterwards
propitiate
the
souls
of
the
slain
in
the
temple
in
some
dyak
tribes
men
on
returning
from
an
expedition
in
which
they
have
taken
human
heads
are
obliged
to
keep
by
themselves
and
abstain
from
a
variety
of
things
for
several
days
they
may
not
touch
iron
nor
eat
salt
or
fish
with
bones
and
they
may
have
no

an
island
off

shut
themselves
up
for
about
a
week
in
their
houses
they

not
touch
food
with
their
hands
they
may
eat
vegetable
food
only
which
is
brought
to
them
cooked

special
pots
the
intention
of
these
restrictions
is
to
guard
the
men
against
the
smell
of
the
blood
of
the
slain
for
it
is
believed
that
if
they
smelt
the
blood
they
would
fall
ill
and
die
in
the
toaripi
or
motumotu
tribe
of
new

a

who
has
killed
another
may
not
go
near
his

and
may
not
touch
food
with
his
fingers
he
is
fed
by
others
and
only
with
certain
kinds
of
food
these
observances
last
till
the
new
moon
among
the
tribes
at
the
mouth
of
the
wanigela
river
in
new
guinea
a
man
who
has
taken
life
is
considered
to
be
impure
until
he
has
undergone
certain
ceremonies
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
deed
he
cleanses
himself
and
his
weapon
this
satisfactorily
accomplished
he
repairs
to
his
village
and
seats
himself
on
the
logs
of
sacrificial
staging
no
one
approaches
him
or
takes
any
notice
whatever
of
him
a
house
is
prepared
for
him
which
is
put
in
charge
of
two
or
three
small
boys
as
servants
he
may
eat
only
toasted
bananas
and
only
the
centre
portion
of
ends
being
thrown
away
on
the
third
day
of
his
seclusion
a
small
feast
is
prepared
by
his
friends
who
also
fashion
some
new
perineal
bands
for
him
this
is
called
the
next
day
the
man
dons
all
his
best
ornaments
and
badges
for
taking
life
and
sallies
forth
fully
armed
and
parades
the
village
the
next
day
a
hunt
is
organised
and
a
kangaroo
selected
from
the
game
captured
it
is
cut
open
and
the
spleen
and
liver
rubbed
over
the
back
of
the
man
he
then
walks
solemnly
down
to
the
nearest
water
and
standing
in
it
washes
himself
all
the
young
untried
warriors
swim
between
his
legs
this
is
supposed
to
impart
courage
and
strength
to
them
the
following
day
at
early
dawn
he
dashes
out
of
his
house
fully
armed
and
calls
aloud
the
name
of
his
victim
having
satisfied
himself
that
he
has
thoroughly
scared
the
ghost
of
the
dead
man
he
returns
to
his
house
the
beating
of
and
the
lighting
of
fires
is
also
a
certain
method
of
scaring
the
ghost
a
day
later
his
purification
is
finished
he
can
then
enter

among

homicides
were
secluded
in
the
warriors
clubhouse
they
had
to
pass
the
night
in
the
building
but
during
the
day
they
might
paint
and
decorate
themselves
and
dance
in
front
of
it
for
some
time
they
might
not
eat
much
food
nor
touch
it
with
their
hands
but
were
obliged
to
pick
it
up
on
a
bone
fork
the
heft
of
which
was
wrapped
in
a
banana
leaf
after
a
while
they
bathed
in
the
sea
and
thence
forward
for
a
period
of
about
a
month
though
they
had
still
to
sleep
in
the
warriors
clubhouse
they
were
free
to
eat
as
much
food
as
they
pleased
and
to
pick
it
up
with
their
bare
hands
finally
those
warriors
who
had
never
killed
a
man
before
assumed
a
beautiful
ornament
made
of
fretted
turtle
shell
which
none
but
homicides
were
allowed
to
flaunt
in
their
then
came
a
dance
and
that
same
night
the
men
who
wore
the
honourable
badge
of
homicide
for
the
first
time
were
chased
about
the
village
embers
were
thrown
at
them
and
firebrands
waved
in
order
apparently
to
drive
away
the
souls
of
the
dead
enemies
who
seem
to
be
conceived
as
immanent
in
some
way
in
the
headgear
of
their
slayers
again
among
the
koita
of
british
new
guinea
when
a
man
had
killed
another
whether
the
victim
were
male
or
female
he
did
not
wash
the
blood
off
the
spear
or
club
but
carefully
allowed
it
to
dry
on
the
weapon
on
his
way
home
he
bathed
in
fresh
or
salt
water
and
on
reaching
his
village
went
straight
to
his
own
house
where
he
remained
in
seclusion
for
about
a
week
he
was
taboo
he
might
not
approach
women
and
he
lifted
his
food
to
his
mouth
with
a
bone
fork
his
were
not
obliged
to
leave
the
house
but
they
might
not
come
near
him
at
the
end
of
a
week
he
built
a
rough
shelter
in
the
forest
where
he
lived
for
a
few
days
during
this
time
he
made
a
new
which
he
wore
on
his
return
to
the
village
a
man
who
has
slain
another
is
supposed
to
grow
thin
and
emaciated
because
he
had
been
splashed
with
the
blood
of
his
victim
and
as
the
corpse
rotted
he
wasted
away
among
the
southern
massim
of
british
new
guinea
a
warrior
who
has
taken
a
prisoner
or
slain
a
man
remains
secluded
in
his
house
for
six
days
during
the
first
three
days
he
may
eat
only
roasted
food
and
must
cook
it
for
himself
then
he
bathes
and
blackens
his
face
for
the
remaining
three
days
among
the
monumbos
of
german
new
guinea
any
one
who
has
slain
a
foe
in
war
becomes
thereby
unclean
and
they
apply
the
same
term
unclean
to
menstruous
and
women
and
also
to
everything
that
has
come
into
contact
with
a
corpse
which
shews
that
all
these
classes
of
persons
and
things
are
closely
associated
in
their
minds
the
unclean
man
who
has
killed
an
enemy
in
battle
must
remain
a
long
time
in
the
men
s
clubhouse
while
the
villagers
gather
round
him
and
celebrate
his
victory
with
dance
and
song
he
may
touch
nobody
not
even
his
own
wife
and
children
if
he
were
to
touch
them
it
is
believed
that
they
would
be
covered
with
sores
he
becomes
clean
again
by
washing
and
using
other
modes
of
purification
in
windessi
dutch
new
guinea
when
a
party
of
has
been
successful
and
they
are
nearing
home
they
announce
their
approach
and
success
by
blowing
on
triton
shells
their
canoes
are
also
decked
with
branches
the
faces
of
the
men
who
have
taken
a
head
are
blackened
with
charcoal
if
several
have
taken
part
in
killing
the
same
victim
his
head
is
divided
among
them
they
always
time
their
arrival
so
as
to
reach
home
in
the
early
morning
they
come
rowing
to
the
village
with
a
great
noise
and
the
women
stand
ready
to
dance
in
the
verandahs
of
the
houses
the
canoes
row
past
the
or
house
where
the
young
men
live
and
as
they
pass
the
murderers
throw
as
many
pointed
sticks
or
bamboos
at
the
wall
or
the
roof
as
there
were
enemies
killed
the
day
is
spent
very
quietly
now
and
then
they
drum
or
blow
on
the
conch
at
other
times
they
beat
the
walls
of
the
houses
with
loud
shouts
to
drive
away
the
ghosts
of
the
slain
similarly
in
the
doreh
district
of
dutch
new
guinea
if
a
murder
has
taken
place
in
the
village
the
inhabitants
assemble
for
several
evenings
in
succession
and
utter
frightful
yells
to
drive
away
the
ghost
of
the
victim
in
case
he
should
be
minded
to
hang
about
the
village
so
the
yabim
of
german
new
guinea
believe
that
the
spirit
of
a
murdered
man
pursues
his
murderer
and
seeks
to
do
him
a
mischief
hence
they
drive
away
the
spirit
with
shouts
and
the
beating
of
drums
when
the
fijians
had
buried
a
man
alive
as
they
often
did
they
used
at
nightfall
to
make
a
great
uproar
by
means
of
bamboos
and
so
forth
for
the
purpose
of
frightening
away
his
ghost
lest
he
should
attempt
to
return
to
his
old
home
and
to
render
his
house
unattractive
to
him
they
dismantled
it
and
clothed
it
with
everything
that
to
their
ideas
seemed
most
repulsive
on
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
they
had
tortured
a
prisoner
to
death
the
american
indians
were
wont
to
run
through
the
village
with
hideous
yells
beating
with
sticks
on
the
furniture
the
walls
and
the
roofs
of
the
huts
to
prevent
the
angry
ghost
of
their
victim
from
settling
there
and
taking
vengeance
for
the
torments
that
his
body
had
endured
at
their
hands
once
says
a
traveller
on
approaching
in
the
night
a
village
of
ottawas
i
found
all
the
inhabitants
in
confusion
they
were
all
busily
engaged
in
raising
noises
of
the
loudest
and
most
inharmonious
kind
upon
inquiry
i
found
that
a
battle
had
been
lately
fought
between
the
ottawas
and
the
kickapoos
and
that
the
object
of
all
this
noise
was
to
prevent
the
ghosts
of
the
departed
combatants
from
entering
the
the
executioner
at
porto
novo
on
the
coast
of
guinea
used
to
decorate
his
walls
with
the
jawbones
of
the
persons
on
whom
he
had
operated
in
the
course
of
business
but
for
this
simple
precaution
their
ghosts
would
unquestionably
have
come
at
night
to
knock
with
sobs
and
groans
in
an
insufferable
manner
at
the
door
of
the
room
where
he
slept
the
sleep
of
the
just
the
temper
of
a
man
who
has
just
been
executed
is
naturally
somewhat
short
and
in
a
burst
of
vexation
his
ghost
is
apt
to
fall
foul
of
the
first
person
he
comes
across
without
discriminating
between
the
objects
of
his
wrath
with
that
nicety
of
judgment
which
in
calmer
moments
he
may
be
expected
to
display
hence
in
china
it
is
or
used
to
be
customary
for
the
spectators
of
an
execution
to
shew
a
clean
pair
of
heels
to
the
ghosts
as
soon
as
the
last
head
was
off
the
same
fear
of
the
spirits
of
his
victims
leads
the
executioner
sometimes
to
live
in
seclusion
for
some
time
after
he
has
discharged
his
office
thus
an
old
writer
speaking
of
issini
on
the
gold
coast
of
west
africa
tells
us
that
the
executioners
being
reckoned
impure
for
three
days
they
build
them
a
separate
hut
at
a
distance
from
the
village
meantime
these
fellows
run
like
madmen
through
the
place
seizing
all
they
can
lay
hands
on
poultry
sheep
bread
and
oil
everything
they
can
touch
is
theirs
being
deemed
so
polluted
that
the
owners
willingly
give
it
up
they
continue
three
days
confined
to
their
hut
their
friends
bringing
them
victuals
this
time
expired
they
take
their
hut
in
pieces
which
they
bundle
up
not
leaving
so
much
as
the
ashes
of
their
fire
the
first
executioner
having
a
pot
on
his
head
leads
them
to
the
place
where
the
criminal
suffered
there
they
all
call
him
thrice
by
his
name
the
first
executioner
breaks
his
pot
and
leaving
their
old
rags
and
bundles
they
all
scamper
here
the
invocation
of
the
victim
by
name
gives
the
clue
to
the
rest
of
the
observances
all
of
them
are
probably
intended
to
ward
off
the
angry
ghost
of
the
slain
man
or
to
give
him
the
slip
among
the
basutos
ablution
is
specially
performed
on
return
from
battle
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
the
warriors
should
rid
themselves
as
soon
as
possible
of
the
blood
they
have
shed
or
the
shades
of
their
victims
would
pursue
them
incessantly
and
disturb
their
slumbers
they
go
in
a
procession
and
in
full
armour
to
the
nearest
stream
at
the
moment
they
enter
the
water
a
diviner
placed
higher
up
throws
some
purifying
substances
into
the
current
this
is
however
not
strictly
necessary
the
javelins
and
also
undergo
the
process
of
according
to
another
account
of
the
basuto
custom
warriors
who
have
killed
an
enemy
are
purified
the
chief
has
to
wash
them
sacrificing
an
ox
in
presence
of
the
whole
army
they
are
also
anointed
with
the
gall
of
the
animal
which
prevents
the
ghost
of
the
enemy
from
pursuing
them
any
among
the
bechuanas
a
man
who
has
killed
another
whether
in
war
or
in
single
combat
is
not
allowed
to
enter
the
village
until
he
has
been
purified
the
ceremony
takes
place
in
the
evening
an
ox
is
slaughtered
and
a
hole
having
been
made
through
the
middle
of
the
carcase
with
a
spear
the
manslayer
has
to
force
himself
through
the
animal
while
two
men
hold
its
stomach
open
sometimes
instead
of
being
obliged
to
squeeze
through
the
carcase
of
an
ox
the
manslayer
is
merely
smeared
with
the
contents
of
its
stomach
the
ceremony
has
been
described
as
follows
in
the
purification
of
warriors
too
the
ox
takes
a
conspicuous
part
the
warrior
who
has
slain
a
man
in
the
battle
is
unclean
and
must
on
no
account
enter
his
own
courtyard
for
it
would
be
a
serious
thing
if
even
his
shadow
were
to
fall
upon
his
children
he
studiously
keeps
himself
apart
from
the
civil
life
of
the
town
until
he
is
purified
the
purification
ceremony
is
significant
having
bathed
himself
in
running
water
or
if
that
is
not
convenient
in
water
that
has
been
appropriately
medicated
he
is
smeared
by
the
doctor
with
the
contents
of
the
stomach
of
an
ox
into
which
certain
powdered
roots
have
been
already
mixed
and
then
the
doctor
strikes
him
on
the
back
sides
and
belly
with
the
large
bowel
of
an
ox
a
doctor
takes
a
piece
of
roasted
beef
and
cuts
it
into
small
lumps
of
about
the
size
of
a
walnut
laying
them
carefully
on
a
large
wooden
trencher
he
has
already
prepared
charcoal
by
roasting
the
root
of
certain
trees
in
an
old
cracked
pot
and
this
he
grinds
down
and
sprinkles
on
the
lumps
of
meat
on
the
trencher
then
the
army
surrounds
the
trencher
and
every
one
who
has
slain
a
foe
in
the
battle
steps
forth
kneels
down
before
the
trencher
and
takes
out
a
piece
of
meat
with
his
mouth
taking
care
not
to
touch
it
or
the
trencher
with
his
hands
as
he
takes
the
meat
the
doctor
gives
him
a
smart
cut
with
a
switch
and
when
he
has
eaten
that
lump
of
meat
his
purification
is
complete
this
ceremony
is
called
alafsha
or
the
purification
of
the
the
writer
to
whom
we
owe
this
description
adds
this
taking
of
meat
from
the
trencher
without
using
the
hands
is
evidently
a
matter
of
the
observation
is
correct
here
as
in
so
many
cases
persons
ceremonially
unclean
are
forbidden
to
touch
food
with
defiled
hands
until
their
uncleanness
has
been
purged
away
the
same
taboo
is
laid
on
the
manslayer
by
the
bageshu
of
british
east
africa
among
them
a
man
who
has
killed
another
may
not
return
to
his
own
house
on
the
same
day
though
he
may
enter
the
village
and
spend
the
night
in
a
friend
s
house
he
kills
a
sheep
and
smears
his
chest
his
right
arm
and
his
head
with
the
contents
of
the
animal
s
stomach
his
children
are
brought
to
him
and
he
smears
them
in
like
manner
then
he
smears
each
side
of
the
doorway
with
the
tripe
and
entrails
and
finally
throws
the
rest
of
the
stomach
on
the
roof
of
his
house
for
a
whole
day
he
may
not
touch
food
with
his
hands
but
picks
it
up
with
two
sticks
and
so
conveys
it
to
his
mouth
his
wife
is
not
under
any
such
restrictions
she
may
even
go
to
mourn
for
the
man
whom
her
husband
has
killed
if
she
wishes
to
do
so
in
some
bechuana
tribes
the
victorious
warrior
is
obliged
to
eat
a
piece
of
the
skin
of
the
man
he
killed
the
skin
is
taken
from
about
the
navel
of
his
victim
and
without
it
he
may
not
enter
the
cattle
pen
moreover
the
makes
a
gash
with
a
spear
in
the
warrior
s
thigh
for
every
man
he
has
killed
among
the
angoni
a
zulu
tribe
settled
to
the
north
of
the
zambesi
warriors
who
have
slain
foes
on
an
expedition
smear
their
bodies
and
faces
with
ashes
hang
garments
of
their
victims
on
their
persons
and
tie
bark
ropes
round
their
necks
so
that
the
ends
hang
down
over
their
shoulders
or
breasts
this
costume
they
wear
for
three
days
after
their
return
and
rising
at
break
of
day
they
run
through
the
village
uttering
frightful
yells
to
drive
away
the
ghosts
of
the
slain
which
if
they
were
not
thus
banished
from
the
houses
might
bring
sickness
and
misfortune
on
the
inmates
in
some
caffre
tribes
of
south
africa
men
who
have
been
wounded
or
killed
an
enemy
in
fight
may
not
see
the
king
nor
drink
milk
till
they
have
been
purified
an
ox
is
killed
and
its
gall
intestines
and
other
parts
are
boiled
with
roots
of
this
decoction
the
men
have
to
take
three
gulps
and
the
rest
is
sprinkled
on
their
bodies
the
wounded
man
has
then
to
take
a
stick
spit
on
it
thrice
point
it
thrice
at
the
enemy
and
then
throw
it
in
his
direction
after
that
he
takes
an
emetic
and
is
declared
clean
in
some
of
these
accounts
nothing
is
said
of
an
enforced
seclusion
at
least
after
the
ceremonial
cleansing
but
some
south
african
tribes
certainly
require
the
slayer
of
a
very
gallant
foe
in
war
to
keep
apart
from
his
wife
and
family
for
ten
days
after
he
has
washed
his
body
in
running
water
he
also
receives
from
the
tribal
doctor
a
medicine
which
he
chews
with
his
food
when
a
nandi
of
british
east
africa
has
killed
a
member
of
another
tribe
he
paints
one
side
of
his
body
spear
and
sword
red
and
the
other
side
white
for
four
days
after
the
slaughter
he
is
considered
unclean
and
may
not
go
home
he
has
to
build
a
small
shelter
by
a
river
and
live
there
he
may
not
associate
with
his
wife
or
sweetheart
and
he
may
eat
nothing
but
porridge
beef
and
goat
s
flesh
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
day
he
must
purify
himself
by
taking
a
strong
purge
made
from
the
bark
of
the
tree
and
by
drinking
goat
s
milk
mixed
with
blood
among
the
akikuya
of
british
east
africa
all
who
have
shed
human
blood
must
be
purified
the
elders
assemble
and
one
of
them
cuts
a
strip
of
hair
from
above
both
ears
of
each
manslayer
after
that
the
warriors
rub
themselves
with
the
dung
taken
from
the
stomach
of
a
sheep
which
has
been
slaughtered
for
the
occasion
finally
their
bodies
are
cleansed
with
water
all
the
hair
remaining
on
their
heads
is
subsequently
shaved
off
by
their
wives
for
a
month
after
the
shedding
of
blood
they
may
have
no
contact
with
women
on
the
contrary
when
a
ketosh
warrior
of
british
east
africa
who
has
killed
a
foe
in
battle
returns
home
it
is
considered
essential
that
he
should
have
connection
with
his
wife
as
soon
as
convenient
this
is
believed
to
prevent
the
spirit
of
his
dead
enemy
from
haunting
and
bewitching
an
angoni
who
has
killed
a
man
in
battle
is
obliged
to
perform
certain
purificatory
ceremonies
before
he
may
return
to
ordinary
life
amongst
other
things
he
must
be
sure
to
make
an
incision
in
the
corpse
of
his
slain
foe
in
order
to
let
the
gases
escape
and
so
prevent
the
body
from
swelling
if
he
fails
to
do
so
his
own
body
will
swell
in
proportion
as
the
corpse
becomes
inflated
among
the
ovambos
of
southern
africa
when
the
warriors
return
to
their
villages
those
who
have
killed
an
enemy
pass
the
first
night
in
the
open
fields
and
may
not
enter
their
houses
until
they
have
been
cleansed
of
the
guilt
of
blood
by
an
older
man
who
smears
them
for
this
purpose
with
a
kind
of
porridge
herero
warriors
on
their
return
from
battle
may
not
approach
the
sacred
hearth
until
they
have
been
purified
from
the
guilt
of
bloodshed
they
crouch
in
a
circle
round
the
hearth
but
at
some
distance
from
it
while
the
chief
besprinkles
their
brows
and
temples
with
water
in
which
branches
of
a
holy
bush
have
been
placed
again
ancient
herero
custom
requires
that
he
who
has
killed
a
man
or
a
lion
should
have
blood
drawn
from
his
breast
and
upper
arm
so
as
to
trickle
on
the
ground
a
special
name
is
given
to
the
cuts
thus
made
they
must
be
made
with
a
flint
not
with
an
iron
tool
among
the
bantu
tribes
of
kavirondo
in
eastern
africa
when
a
man
has
killed
an
enemy
in
warfare
he
shaves
his
head
on
his
return
home
and
his
friends
rub
a
medicine
which
generally
consists
of
goat
s
dung
over
his
body
to
prevent
the
spirit
of
the
slain
man
from
troubling
him
exactly
the
same
custom
is
practised
for
the
same
reason
by
the
wageia
of
german
east
africa
with
the
of
kavirondo
the
custom
is
somewhat
different
three
days
after
his
return
from
the
fight
the
warrior
shaves
his
head
but
before
he
may
enter
his
village
he
has
to
hang
a
live
fowl
head
uppermost
round
his
neck
then
the
bird
is
decapitated
and
its
head
left
hanging
round
his
neck
soon
after
his
return
a
feast
is
made
for
the
slain
man
in
order
that
his
ghost
may
not
haunt
his
slayer
after
the
slaughter
of
the
midianites
the
israelitish
warriors
were
obliged
to
remain
outside
the
camp
for
seven
days
whoever
had
killed
a
man
or
touched
the
slain
had
to
purify
himself
and
his
captive
the
spoil
taken
from
the
enemy
had
also
to
be
purified
according
to
its
nature
either
by
fire
or
water
similarly
among
the
basutos
cattle
taken
from
the
enemy
are
fumigated
with
bundles
of
lighted
branches
before
they
are
allowed
to
mingle
with
the
herds
of
the
tribe
the
arunta
of
central
australia
believe
that
when
a
party
of
men
has
been
out
against
the
enemy
and
taken
a
life
the
spirit
of
the
slain
man
follows
the
party
on
its
return
and
is
constantly
on
the
watch
to
do
a
mischief
to
those
of
the
band
who
actually
shed
the
blood
it
takes
the
form
of
a
little
bird
called
the
and
may
be
heard
crying
like
a
child
in
the
distance
as
it
flies
if
any
of
the
slayers
should
fail
to
hear
its
cry
he
would
become
paralysed
in
his
right
arm
and
shoulder
at
especially
when
the
bird
is
flying
over
the
camp
the
slayers
have
to
lie
awake
and
keep
the
right
arm
and
shoulder
carefully
hidden
lest
the
bird
should
look
down
upon
and
harm
them
when
once
they
have
heard
its
cry
their
minds
are
at
ease
because
the
spirit
of
the
dead
then
recognises
that
he
has
been
detected
and
can
therefore
do
no
mischief
on
their
return
to
their
friends
as
soon
as
they
come
in
sight
of
the
main
camp
they
begin
to
perform
an
excited
approaching
in
the
form
of
a
square
and
moving
their
shields
as
if
to
ward
off
something
which
was
being
thrown
at
them
this
action
is
intended
to
repel
the
angry
spirit
of
the
dead
man
who
is
striving
to
attack
them
next
the
men
who
did
the
deed
of
blood
separate
themselves
from
the
others
and
forming
a
line
with
spears
at
rest
and
shields
held
out
in
front
stand
silent
and
motionless
like
statues
a
number
of
old
women
now
approach
with
a
sort
of
exulting
skip
and
strike
the
shields
of
the
manslayers
with
till
they
ring
again
they
are
followed
by
men
who
smite
the
shields
with
boomerangs
this
striking
of
the
shields
is
supposed
to
be
a
very
effective
way
of
frightening
away
the
spirit
of
the
dead
man
the
natives
listen
anxiously
to
the
sounds
emitted
by
the
shields
when
they
are
struck
for
if
any
man
s
shield
gives
forth
a
hollow
sound
under
the
blow
that
man
will
not
live
long
but
if
it
rings
sharp
and
clear
he
is
safe
for
some
days
after
their
return
the
slayers
will
not
speak
of
what
they
have
done
and
continue
to
paint
themselves
all
over
with
powdered
charcoal
and
to
decorate
their
foreheads
and
noses
with
green
twigs
finally
they
paint
their
bodies
and
faces
with
bright
colours
and
become
free
to
talk
about
the
affair
but
still
of
nights
they
must
lie
awake
listening
for
the
plaintive
cry
of
the
bird
in
which
they
fancy
they
hear
the
voice
of
their
victim
in
the
washington
group
of
the
marquesas
islands
the
man
who
has
slain
an
enemy
in
battle
becomes
tabooed
for
ten
days
during
which
he
may
hold
no
intercourse
with
his
wife
and
may
not
meddle
with
fire
hence
another
has
to
make
fire
and
to
cook
for
him
nevertheless
he
is
treated
with
marked
distinction
and
receives
presents
of
pigs
in
fiji
any
one
who
had
clubbed
a
human
being
to
death
in
war
was
consecrated
or
tabooed
he
was
smeared
red
by
the
king
with
turmeric
from
the
roots
of
his
hair
to
his
heels
a
hut
was
built
and
in
it
he
had
to
pass
the
next
three
nights
during
which
he
might
not
lie
down
but
must
sleep
as
he
sat
till
the
three
nights
had
elapsed
he
might
not
change
his
garment
nor
remove
the
turmeric
nor
enter
a
house
in
which
there
was
a
woman
in
the
pelew
islands
when
the
men
return
from
a
warlike
expedition
in
which
they
have
taken
a
life
the
young
warriors
who
have
been
out
fighting
for
the
first
time
and
all
who
handled
the
slain
are
shut
up
in
the
large
and
become
tabooed
they
may
not
quit
the
edifice
nor
bathe
nor
touch
a
woman
nor
eat
fish
their
food
is
limited
to
and
syrup
they
rub
themselves
with
charmed
leaves
and
chew
charmed
betel
after
three
days
they
go
together
to
bathe
as
near
as
possible
to
the
spot
where
the
man
was
killed
when
the
tupi
indians
of
brazil
had
made
a
prisoner
in
war
they
used
to
bring
him
home
amid
great
rejoicings
decked
with
the
gorgeous
plumage
of
tropical
birds
in
the
village
he
was
well
treated
he
received
a
house
and
furniture
and
was
married
to
a
wife
when
he
was
thus
comfortably
installed
the
relations
and
friends
of
his
captor
who
had
the
first
pick
came
and
examined
him
and
decided
which
of
his
limbs
and
joints
they
proposed
to
eat
and
according
to
their
choice
they
were
bound
to
provide
him
with
victuals
thus
he
might
live
for
months
or
years
treated
like
a
king
supplied
with
all
the
delicacies
of
the
country
and
rearing
a
family
of
children
who
when
they
were
big
might
or
might
not
be
eaten
with
their
father
while
he
was
thus
being
fattened
like
a
capon
for
the
slaughter
he
wore
a
necklace
of
fruit
or
of
strung
on
a
cotton
thread
this
was
the
measure
of
his
life
for
every
fruit
or
every
bone
on
the
string
he
had
a
month
to
live
and
as
each
moon
waned
and
vanished
they
took
a
fruit
or
a
bone
from
the
necklace
when
only
one
remained
they
sent
out
invitations
to
friends
and
neighbours
far
and
near
who
flocked
in
sometimes
to
the
number
of
ten
or
twelve
thousand
to
witness
the
spectacle
and
partake
of
the
feast
for
often
a
number
of
prisoners
were
to
die
the
same
day
father
mother
and
children
all
together
as
a
rule
they
shewed
a
remarkable
stolidity
and
indifference
to
death
the
club
with
which
they
were
to
be
despatched
was
elaborately
prepared
by
the
women
who
adorned
it
with
tassels
of
feathers
smeared
it
with
the
pounded
shells
of
a
macaw
s
eggs
and
traced
lines
on
the
powder
then
they
hung
it
to
a
pole
above
the
ground
in
an
empty
hut
and
sang
around
it
all
night
the
executioner
who
was
painted
grey
with
ashes
and
his
whole
body
covered
with
the
beautiful
feathers
of
parrots
and
other
birds
of
gay
plumage
performed
his
office
by
striking
the
victim
on
the
head
from
behind
and
dashing
out
his
brains
no
sooner
had
he
despatched
the
prisoner
than
he
retired
to
his
house
where
he
had
to
stay
all
that
day
without
eating
or
drinking
while
the
rest
of
the
people
feasted
on
the
body
of
the
victim
or
victims
and
for
three
days
he
was
obliged
to
fast
and
remain
in
seclusion
all
this
time
he
lay
in
his
hammock
and
might
not
set
foot
on
the
ground
if
he
had
to
go
anywhere
he
was
carried
by
bearers
they
thought
that
were
he
to
break
this
rule
some
disaster
would
befall
him
or
he
would
die
meantime
he
was
given
a
small
bow
and
passed
his
time
in
shooting
arrows
into
wax
this
he
did
in
order
to
keep
his
hand
and
aim
steady
in
some
of
the
tribes
they
rubbed
the
pulse
of
the
executioner
with
one
of
the
eyes
of
his
victim
and
hung
the
mouth
of
the
murdered
man
like
a
bracelet
on
his
arm
afterwards
he
made
incisions
in
his
breast
arms
and
legs
and
other
parts
of
his
body
with
a
saw
made
of
the
teeth
of
an
animal
an
ointment
and
a
black
powder
were
then
rubbed
into
the
wounds
which
left
ineffaceable
scars
so
artistically
arranged
that
they
presented
the
appearance
of
a
garment
it
was
believed
that
he
would
die
if
he
did
not
thus
draw
blood
from
his
own
body
after
slaughtering
the
captive
we
may
conjecture
that
the
original
intention
of
these
customs
was
to
guard
the
executioner
against
the
angry
and
dangerous
ghosts
of
his
victims
among
the
natchez
of
north
america
young
braves
who
had
taken
their
first
scalps
were
obliged
to
observe
certain
rules
of
abstinence
for
six
months
they
might
not
sleep
with
their
wives
nor
eat
flesh
their
only
food
was
fish
and
if
they
broke
these
rules
they
believed
that
the
soul
of
the
man
they
had
killed
would
work
their
death
by
magic
that
they
would
gain
no
more
successes
over
the
enemy
and
that
the
least
wound
inflicted
on
them
would
prove
mortal
when
a
choctaw
had
killed
an
enemy
and
taken
his
scalp
he
went
into
mourning
for
a
month
during
which
he
might
not
comb
his
hair
and
if
his
head
itched
he
might
not
scratch
it
except
with
a
little
stick
which
he
wore
fastened
to
his
wrist
for
the
purpose
this
ceremonial
mourning
for
the
enemies
they
had
slain
was
not
uncommon
among
the
north
american
indians
thus
the
dacotas
when
they
had
killed
a
foe
unbraided
their
hair
blackened
themselves
all
over
and
wore
a
small
knot
of
swan
s
down
on
the
top
of
the
head
they
dress
as
mourners
yet
a
thompson
river
indian
of
british
columbia
who
had
slain
an
enemy
used
to
blacken
his
own
face
lest
his
victim
s
ghost
should
blind
him
when
the
osages
have
mourned
over
their
own
dead
they
will
mourn
for
the
foe
just
as
if
he
was
a
from
observing
the
great
respect
paid
by
the
indians
to
the
scalps
they
had
taken
and
listening
to
the
mournful
songs
which
they
howled
to
the
shades
of
their
victims
catlin
was
convinced
that
they
have
a
superstitious
dread
of
the
spirits
of
their
slain
enemies
and
many
conciliatory
offices
to
perform
to
ensure
their
own
when
a
pima
indian
has
killed
an
apache
he
must
undergo
purification
sixteen
days
he
fasts
and
only
after
the
fourth
day
is
he
allowed
to
drink
a
little
pinole
during
the
whole
time
he
may
not
touch
meat
nor
salt
nor
look
on
a
blazing
fire
nor
speak
to
a
human
being
he
lives
alone
in
the
woods
waited
on
by
an
old
woman
who
brings
him
his
scanty
dole
of
food
he
bathes
often
in
a
river
and
keeps
his
head
covered
almost
the
whole
time
with
a
plaster
of
mud
on
the
seventeenth
day
a
large
space
is
cleared
near
the
village
and
a
fire
lit
in
the
middle
of
it
the
men
of
the
tribe
form
a
circle
round
the
fire
and
outside
of
it
sit
all
the
warriors
who
have
just
been
purified
each
in
a
small
excavation
some
of
the
old
men
then
take
the
weapons
of
the
purified
and
dance
with
them
in
the
circle
after
which
both
the
slayer
and
his
weapon
are
considered
clean
but
not
until
four
days
later
is
the
man
allowed
to
return
to
his
family
no
doubt
the
peace
enforced
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
along
with
tribal
warfare
abolished
also
these
quaint
customs
a
fuller
account
of
them
has
been
given
by
a
recent
writer
and
it
deserves
to
be
quoted
at
length
there
was
no
law
among
the
pimas
he
says
observed
with
greater
strictness
than
that
which
required
purification
and
expiation
for
the
deed
that
was
at
the
same
time
the
most
killing
of
an
enemy
for
sixteen
days
the
warrior
fasted
in
seclusion
and
observed
meanwhile
a
number
of
tabus
attended
by
an
old
man
the
warrior
who
had
to
expiate
the
crime
of
blood
guilt
retired
to
the
groves
along
the
river
bottom
at
some
distance
from
the
villages
or
wandered
about
the
adjoining
hills
during
the
period
of
sixteen
days
he
was
not
allowed
to
touch
his
head
with
his
fingers
or
his
hair
would
turn
white
if
he
touched
his
face
it
would
become
wrinkled
he
kept
a
stick
to
scratch
his
head
with
and
at
the
end
of
every
four
days
this
stick
was
buried
at
the
root
and
on
the
west
side
of
a
cat
s
claw
tree
and
a
new
stick
was
made
of
greasewood
arrow
bush
or
any
other
convenient
shrub
he
then
bathed
in
the
river
no
matter
how
cold
the
temperature
the
feast
of
victory
which
his
friends
were
observing
in
the
meantime
at
the
village
lasted
eight
days
at
the
end
of
that
time
or
when
his
period
of
retirement
was
the
warrior
might
go
to
his
home
to
get
a
fetish
made
from
the
hair
of
the
apache
whom
he
had
killed
the
hair
was
wrapped
in
eagle
down
and
tied
with
a
cotton
string
and
kept
in
a
long
medicine
basket
he
drank
no
water
for
the
first
two
days
and
fasted
for
the
first
four
after
that
time
he
was
supplied
with
pinole
by
his
attendant
who
also
instructed
him
as
to
his
future
conduct
telling
him
that
he
must
henceforth
stand
back
until
all
others
were
served
when
partaking
of
food
and
drink
if
he
was
a
married
man
his
wife
was
not
allowed
to
eat
salt
during
his
retirement
else
she
would
suffer
from
the
owl
disease
which
causes
stiff
limbs
the
explanation
offered
for
the
observance
of
this
law
of
lustration
is
that
if
it
is
not
obeyed
the
warrior
s
limbs
will
become
stiffened
or
the
apaches
the
enemies
of
the
pimas
purify
themselves
for
the
slaughter
of
their
foes
by
means
of
baths
in
the
singing
and
other
rites
these
ceremonies
they
perform
for
all
the
dead
simultaneously
after
their
return
home
but
the
pimas
more
punctilious
on
this
point
resort
to
their
elaborate
ceremonies
of
purification
the
moment
a
single
one
of
their
own
band
or
of
the
enemy
has
been
laid
low
how
heavily
these
religious
scruples
must
have
told
against
the
pimas
in
their
wars
with
their
ferocious
enemies
is
obvious
enough
this
long
period
of
retirement
immediately
after
a
battle
says
an
american
writer
greatly
diminished
the
value
of
the
pimas
as
scouts
and
allies
for
the
united
states
troops
operating
against
the
apaches
the
bravery
of
the
pimas
was
praised
by
all
army
officers
having
any
experience
with
them
but
captain
bourke
and
others
have
complained
of
their
unreliability
due
solely
to
their
rigid
observance
of
this
religious
in
nothing
perhaps
is
the
penalty
which
superstition
sooner
or
later
entails
on
its
devotees
more
prompt
and
crushing
than
in
the
operations
of
war
far
away
from
the
torrid
home
of
the
pima
and
apaches
an
old
traveller
witnessed
ceremonies
of
the
same
sort
practised
near
the
arctic
circle
by
some
indians
who
had
surprised
and
brutally
massacred
an
unoffending
and
helpless
party
of
esquimaux
his
description
is
so
interesting
that
i
will
quote
it
in
full
among
the
various
superstitious
customs
of
those
people
it
is
worth
remarking
and
ought
to
have
been
mentioned
in
its
proper
place
that
immediately
after
my
companions
had
killed
the
esquimaux
at
the
copper
river
they
considered
themselves
in
a
state
of
uncleanness
which
induced
them
to
practise
some
very
curious
and
unusual
ceremonies
in
the
first
place
all
who
were
absolutely
concerned
in
the
murder
were
prohibited
from
cooking
any
kind
of
victuals
either
for
themselves
or
others
as
luckily
there
were
two
in
company
who
had
not
shed
blood
they
were
employed
always
as
cooks
till
we
joined
the
women
this
circumstance
was
exceedingly
favourable
on
my
side
for
had
there
been
no
persons
of
the
above
description
in
company
that
task
i
was
told
would
have
fallen
on
me
which
would
have
been
no
less
fatiguing
and
troublesome
than
humiliating
and
vexatious
when
the
victuals
were
cooked
all
the
murderers
took
a
kind
of
red
earth
or
oker
and
painted
all
the
space
between
the
nose
and
chin
as
well
as
the
greater
part
of
their
cheeks
almost
to
the
ears
before
they
would
taste
a
bit
and
would
not
drink
out
of
any
other
dish
or
smoke
out
of
any
other
pipe
but
their
own
and
none
of
the
others
seemed
willing
to
drink
or
smoke
out
of
theirs
we
had
no
sooner
joined
the
women
at
our
return
from
the
expedition
than
there
seemed
to
be
an
universal
spirit
of
emulation
among
them
vying
who
should
first
make
a
suit
of
ornaments
for
their
husbands
which
consisted
of
bracelets
for
the
wrists
and
a
band
for
the
forehead
composed
of
porcupine
quills
and
curiously
wrought
on
leather
the
custom
of
painting
the
mouth
and
part
of
the
cheeks
before
each
meal
and
drinking
and
smoking
out
of
their
own
utensils
was
strictly
and
invariably
observed
till
the
winter
began
to
set
in
and
during
the
whole
of
that
time
they
would
never
kiss
any
of
their
wives
or
children
they
refrained
also
from
eating
many
parts
of
the
deer
and
other
animals
particularly
the
head
entrails
and
blood
and
during
their
uncleanness
their
victuals
were
never
sodden
in
water
but
dried
in
the
sun
eaten
quite
raw
or
broiled
when
a
fire
fit
for
the
purpose
could
be
procured
when
the
time
arrived
that
was
to
put
an
end
to
these
ceremonies
the
men
without
a
female
being
present
made
a
fire
at
some
distance
from
the
tents
into
which
they
threw
all
their
ornaments
and
dishes
which
were
soon
consumed
to
ashes
after
which
a
feast
was
prepared
consisting
of
such
articles
as
they
had
long
been
prohibited
from
eating
and
when
all
was
over
each
man
was
at
liberty
to
eat
drink
and
smoke
as
he
pleased
and
also
to
kiss
his
wives
and
children
at
discretion
which
they
seemed
to
do
with
more
raptures
than
i
had
ever
known
them
do
it
either
before
or
thus
we
see
that
warriors
who
have
taken
the
life
of
a
foe
in
battle
are
temporarily
cut
off
from
free
intercourse
with
their
fellows
and
especially
with
their
wives
and
must
undergo
certain
rites
of
purification
before
they
are
readmitted
to
society
now
if
the
purpose
of
their
seclusion
and
of
the
expiatory
rites
which
they
have
to
perform
is
as
we
have
been
led
to
believe
no
other
than
to
shake
off
frighten
or
appease
the
angry
spirit
of
the
slain
man
we
may
safely
conjecture
that
the
similar
purification
of
homicides
and
murderers
who
have
imbrued
their
hands
in
the
blood
of
a
had
at
first
the
same
significance
and
that
the
idea
of
a
moral
or
spiritual
regeneration
symbolised
by
the
washing
the
fasting
and
so
on
was
merely
a
later
interpretation
put
upon
the
old
custom
by
men
who
had
outgrown
the
primitive
modes
of
thought
in
which
the
custom
originated
the
conjecture
will
be
confirmed
if
we
can
shew
that
savages
have
actually
imposed
certain
restrictions
on
the
murderer
of
a
from
a
definite
fear
that
he
is
haunted
by
the
ghost
of
his
victim
this
we
can
do
with
regard
to
the
omahas
a
tribe
of
the
siouan
stock
in
north
america
among
these
indians
the
kinsmen
of
a
murdered
man
had
the
right
to
put
the
murderer
to
death
but
sometimes
they
waived
their
right
in
consideration
of
presents
which
they
consented
to
accept
when
the
life
of
the
murderer
was
spared
he
had
to
observe
certain
stringent
rules
for
a
period
which
varied
from
two
to
four
years
he
must
walk
barefoot
and
he
might
eat
no
warm
food
nor
raise
his
voice
nor
look
around
he
was
compelled
to
pull
his
robe
about
him
and
to
have
it
tied
at
the
neck
even
in
hot
weather
he
might
not
let
it
hang
loose
or
fly
open
he
might
not
move
his
hands
about
but
had
to
keep
them
close
to
his
body
he
might
not
comb
his
hair
and
it
might
not
be
blown
about
by
the
wind
when
the
tribe
went
out
hunting
he
was
obliged
to
pitch
his
tent
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
rest
of
the
people
lest
the
ghost
of
his
victim
should
raise
a
high
wind
which
might
cause
only
one
of
his
kindred
was
allowed
to
remain
with
him
at
his
tent
no
one
wished
to
eat
with
him
for
they
said
if
we
eat
with
him
whom
wakanda
hates
wakanda
will
hate
sometimes
he
wandered
at
night
crying
and
lamenting
his
offence
at
the
end
of
his
long
isolation
the
kinsmen
of
the
murdered
man
heard
his
crying
and
said
it
is
enough
begone
and
walk
among
the
crowd
put
on
moccasins
and
wear
a
good
here
the
reason
alleged
for
keeping
the
murderer
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
hunters
gives
the
clue
to
all
the
other
restrictions
laid
on
him
he
was
haunted
and
therefore
dangerous
the
ancient
greeks
believed
that
the
soul
of
a
man
who
had
just
been
killed
was
wroth
with
his
slayer
and
troubled
him
wherefore
it
was
needful
even
for
the
involuntary
homicide
to
depart
from
his
country
for
a
year
until
the
anger
of
the
dead
man
had
cooled
down
nor
might
the
slayer
return
until
sacrifice
had
been
offered
and
ceremonies
of
purification
performed
if
his
victim
chanced
to
be
a
foreigner
the
homicide
had
to
shun
the
native
country
of
the
dead
man
as
well
as
his
own
the
legend
of
the
matricide
orestes
how
he
roamed
from
place
to
place
pursued
by
the
furies
of
his
murdered
mother
and
none
would
sit
at
meat
with
him
or
take
him
in
till
he
had
been
purified
reflects
faithfully
the
real
greek
dread
of
such
as
were
still
haunted
by
an
angry
ghost
when
the
turbulent
people
of
cynaetha
after
perpetrating
an
atrocious
massacre
sent
an
embassy
to
sparta
every
arcadian
town
through
which
the
envoys
passed
on
their
journey
ordered
them
out
of
its
walls
at
once
and
the
mantineans
after
the
embassy
had
departed
even
instituted
a
solemn
purification
of
the
city
and
its
territory
by
carrying
sacrificial
victims
round
them
both
among
the
kwakiutl
indians
of
british
columbia
men
who
have
partaken
of
human
flesh
as
a
ceremonial
rite
are
subject
for
a
long
time
afterwards
to
many
restrictions
or
taboos
of
the
sort
we
have
been
dealing
with
they
may
not
touch
their
wives
for
a
whole
year
and
during
the
same
time
they
are
forbidden
to
work
or
gamble
for
four
months
they
must
live
alone
in
their
bedrooms
and
when
they
are
obliged
to
quit
the
house
for
a
necessary
purpose
they
may
not
go
out
at
the
ordinary
door
but
must
use
only
the
secret
door
in
the
rear
of
the
house
on
such
occasions
each
of
them
is
attended
by
all
the
rest
carrying
small
sticks
they
must
all
sit
down
together
on
a
long
log
then
get
up
then
sit
down
again
repeating
this
three
times
before
they
are
allowed
to
remain
seated
before
they
rise
they
must
turn
round
four
times
then
they
go
back
to
the
house
before
entering
they
must
raise
their
feet
four
times
with
the
fourth
step
they
really
pass
the
door
taking
care
to
enter
with
the
right
foot
foremost
in
the
doorway
they
turn
four
times
and
walk
slowly
into
the
house
they
are
not
permitted
to
look
back
during
the
four
months
of
their
seclusion
each
man
in
eating
must
use
a
spoon
dish
and
kettle
of
his
own
which
are
thrown
away
at
the
end
of
the
period
before
he
draws
water
from
a
bucket
or
a
brook
he
must
dip
his
cup
into
it
thrice
and
he
may
not
take
more
than
four
mouthfuls
at
one
time
he
must
carry
a
of
an
eagle
and
drink
through
it
for
his
lips
may
not
touch
the
brim
of
his
cup
also
he
keeps
a
copper
nail
to
scratch
his
head
with
for
were
his
own
nails
to
touch
his
own
skin
they
would
drop
off
for
sixteen
days
after
he
has
partaken
of
human
flesh
he
may
not
eat
any
warm
food
and
for
the
whole
of
the
four
months
he
is
forbidden
to
cool
hot
food
by
blowing
on
it
with
his
breath
at
the
end
of
winter
when
the
season
of
ceremonies
is
over
he
feigns
to
have
forgotten
the
ordinary
ways
of
men
and
has
to
learn
everything
anew
the
reason
for
these
remarkable
restrictions
imposed
on
men
who
have
eaten
human
flesh
is
not
stated
but
we
may
surmise
that
fear
of
the
ghost
of
the
man
whose
body
was
eaten
has
at
least
a
good
deal
to
do
with
them
we
are
confirmed
in
our
conjecture
by
observing
that
though
these
cannibals
sometimes
content
themselves
with
taking
bites
out
of
living
people
the
rules
in
question
are
especially
obligatory
on
them
after
they
have
devoured
a
corpse
moreover
the
careful
treatment
of
the
bones
of
the
victim
points
to
the
same
conclusion
for
during
the
four
months
of
seclusion
observed
by
the
cannibals
the
bones
of
the
person
on
whom
they
feasted
are
kept
alternately
for
four
days
at
a
time
under
rocks
in
the
sea
and
in
their
bedrooms
on
the
north
side
of
the
house
where
the
sun
can
not
shine
on
them
finally
the
bones
are
taken
out
of
the
house
tied
up
weighted
with
a
stone
and
thrown
into
deep
water
because
it
is
believed
that
if
they
were
buried
they
would
come
back
and
take
their
master
s
this
seems
to
mean
that
if
the
bones
of
the
victim
were
buried
his
ghost
would
come
back
and
fetch
away
the
souls
of
the
men
who
had
eaten
his
body
the
gebars
a
cannibal
tribe
in
the
north
of
new
guinea
are
much
afraid
of
the
spirit
of
a
slain
man
or
woman
among
them
persons
who
have
partaken
of
human
flesh
for
the
first
time
reside
for
a
month
afterwards
in
a
small
hut
and
may
not
enter
the
hunters
and
fishers
tabooed
in
savage
society
the
hunter
and
the
fisherman
have
often
to
observe
rules
of
abstinence
and
to
submit
to
ceremonies
of
purification
of
the
same
sort
as
those
which
are
obligatory
on
the
warrior
and
the
manslayer
and
though
we
can
not
in
all
cases
perceive
the
exact
purpose
which
these
rules
and
ceremonies
are
supposed
to
serve
we
may
with
some
probability
assume
that
just
as
the
dread
of
the
spirits
of
his
enemies
is
the
main
motive
for
the
seclusion
and
purification
of
the
warrior
who
hopes
to
take
or
has
already
taken
their
lives
so
the
huntsman
or
fisherman
who
complies
with
similar
customs
is
principally
actuated
by
a
fear
of
the
spirits
of
the
beasts
birds
or
fish
which
he
has
killed
or
intends
to
kill
for
the
savage
commonly
conceives
animals
to
be
endowed
with
souls
and
intelligences
like
his
own
and
hence
he
naturally
treats
them
with
similar
respect
just
as
he
attempts
to
appease
the
ghosts
of
the
men
he
has
slain
so
he
essays
to
propitiate
the
spirits
of
the
animals
he
has
killed
these
ceremonies
of
propitiation
will
be
described
later
on
in
this
work
here
we
have
to
deal
first
with
the
taboos
observed
by
the
hunter
and
the
fisherman
before
or
during
the
hunting
and
fishing
seasons
and
second
with
the
ceremonies
of
purification
which
have
to
be
practised
by
these
men
on
returning
with
their
booty
from
a
successful
chase
while
the
savage
respects
more
or
less
the
souls
of
all
animals
he
treats
with
particular
deference
the
spirits
of
such
as
are
either
especially
useful
to
him
or
formidable
on
account
of
their
size
strength
or
ferocity
accordingly
the
hunting
and
killing
of
these
valuable
or
dangerous
beasts
are
subject
to
more
elaborate
rules
and
ceremonies
than
the
slaughter
of
comparatively
useless
and
insignificant
creatures
thus
the
indians
of
nootka
sound
prepared
themselves
for
catching
whales
by
observing
a
fast
for
a
week
during
which
they
ate
very
little
bathed
in
the
water
several
times
a
day
sang
and
rubbed
their
bodies
limbs
and
faces
with
shells
and
bushes
till
they
looked
as
if
they
had
been
severely
torn
with
briars
they
were
likewise
required
to
abstain
from
any
commerce
with
their
women
for
the
like
period
this
last
condition
being
considered
indispensable
to
their
success
a
chief
who
failed
to
catch
a
whale
has
been
known
to
attribute
his
failure
to
a
breach
of
chastity
on
the
part
of
his
men
it
should
be
remarked
that
the
conduct
thus
prescribed
as
a
preparation
for
whaling
is
precisely
that
which
in
the
same
tribe
of
indians
was
required
of
men
about
to
go
on
the
rules
of
the
same
sort
are
or
were
formerly
observed
by
malagasy
whalers
for
eight
days
before
they
went
to
sea
the
crew
of
a
whaler
used
to
fast
abstaining
from
women
and
liquor
and
confessing
their
most
secret
faults
to
each
other
and
if
any
man
was
found
to
have
sinned
deeply
he
was
forbidden
to
share
in
the
expedition
in
the
island
of
kadiak
off
the
south
coast
of
alaska
whalers
were
reckoned
unclean
during
the
fishing
season
and
nobody
would
eat
out
of
the
same
dish
with
them
or
even
come
near
them
yet
we
are
told
that
great
respect
was
paid
to
them
and
that
they
were
regarded
as
the
purveyors
of
their
country
though
it
is
not
expressly
said
it
seems
to
be
implied
and
on
the
strength
of
analogy
we
may
assume
that
these
kadiak
whalers
had
to
remain
chaste
so
long
as
the
whaling
season
lasted
in
the
island
of
mabuiag
continence
was
imposed
on
the
people
both
before
they
went
to
hunt
the
dugong
and
while
the
turtles
were
pairing
the
lasts
during
parts
of
october
and
november
and
if
at
that
time
unmarried
persons
had
sexual
intercourse
with
each
other
it
was
believed
that
when
the
canoe
approached
the
floating
turtle
the
male
would
separate
from
the
female
and
both
would
dive
down
in
different
directions
so
at
mowat
in
new
guinea
men
have
no
relation
with
women
when
the
turtle
are
coupling
though
there
is
considerable
laxity
of
morals
at
other
times
among
the
motu
of
port
moresby
in
new
guinea
chastity
is
enjoined
before
fishing
and
they
believe
that
men
who
have
been
unchaste
will
be
unable
to
catch
the
fish
and
the
wallabies
which
will
turn
round
and
jeer
at
their
pursuers
among
the
tribes
about
the
mouth
of
the
wanigela
river
in
new
guinea
the
preparations
for
fishing
turtle
and
dugong
are
most
elaborate
they
begin
two
months
before
the
fishing
a
headman
is
appointed
who
becomes
holy
on
his
strict
observance
of
the
laws
of
the
dugong
net
depends
the
success
of
the
season
while
the
men
of
the
village
are
making
the
nets
this
sanctified
leader
lives
entirely
secluded
from
his
family
and
may
only
eat
a
roasted
banana
or
two
after
the
sun
has
gone
down
every
evening
at
sundown
he
goes
ashore
and
stripping
himself
of
all
his
ornaments
which
he
is
never
allowed
to
doff
at
other
times
bathes
near
where
the
dugongs
feed
as
he
does
so
he
throws
scraped
and
scented
herbs
and
gums
into
the
water
to
charm
the
dugong
among
the
tribes
of
british
new
guinea
the
magician
who
performs
ceremonies
for
the
success
of
a
wallaby
hunt
must
abstain
from
intercourse
with
his
wife
for
a
month
before
the
hunt
takes
place
and
he
may
not
eat
food
cooked
by
his
wife
or
by
any
other
woman
in
the
island
of
uap
one
of
the
caroline
group
every
fisherman
plying
his
craft
lies
under
a
most
strict
taboo
during
the
whole
of
the
fishing
season
which
lasts
for
six
or
eight
weeks
whenever
he
is
on
shore
he
must
spend
all
his
time
in
the
men
s
clubhouse
and
under
no
pretext
whatever
may
he
visit
his
own
house
or
so
much
as
look
upon
the
faces
of
his
wife
and
womenkind
were
he
but
to
steal
a
glance
at
them
they
think
that
flying
fish
must
inevitably
bore
out
his
eyes
at
night
if
his
wife
mother
or
daughter
brings
any
gift
for
him
or
wishes
to
talk
with
him
she
must
stand
down
towards
the
shore
with
her
back
turned
to
the
men
s
clubhouse
then
the
fisherman
may
go
out
and
speak
to
her
or
with
his
back
turned
to
her
he
may
receive
what
she
has
brought
him
after
which
he
must
return
at
once
to
his
rigorous
confinement
indeed
the
fishermen
may
not
even
join
in
dance
and
song
with
the
other
men
of
the
clubhouse
in
the
evening
they
must
keep
to
themselves
and
be
silent
in
the
pelew
islands
also
which
belong
to
the
caroline
group
fishermen
are
likewise
debarred
from
intercourse
with
women
since
it
is
believed
that
any
such
intercourse
would
infallibly
have
a
prejudicial
effect
on
the
fishing
the
same
taboo
is
said
to
be
observed
in
all
the
other
islands
of
the
south
sea
in
mirzapur
when
the
seed
of
the
silkworm
is
brought
into
the
house
the
kol
or
bhuiyar
puts
it
in
a
place
which
has
been
carefully
plastered
with
holy
to
bring
good
luck
from
that
time
the
owner
must
be
careful
to
avoid
ceremonial
impurity
he
must
give
up
cohabitation
with
his
wife
he
may
not
sleep
on
a
bed
nor
shave
himself
nor
cut
his
nails
nor
anoint
himself
with
oil
nor
eat
food
cooked
with
butter
nor
tell
lies
nor
do
anything
else
that
he
deems
wrong
he
vows
to
singarmati
devi
that
if
the
worms
are
duly
born
he
will
make
her
an
offering
when
the
cocoons
open
and
the
worms
appear
he
assembles
the
women
of
the
house
and
they
sing
the
same
song
as
at
the
birth
of
a
baby
and
red
lead
is
smeared
on
the
parting
of
the
hair
of
all
the
married
women
of
the
neighbourhood
when
the
worms
pair
rejoicings
are
made
as
at
a
marriage
thus
the
silkworms
are
treated
as
far
as
possible
like
human
beings
hence
the
custom
which
prohibits
the
commerce
of
the
sexes
while
the
worms
are
hatching
may
be
only
an
extension
by
analogy
of
the
rule
which
is
observed
by
many
races
that
the
husband
may
not
cohabit
with
his
wife
during
pregnancy
and
lactation
on
lake
victoria
nyanza
the
baganda
fishermen
use
a
long
stout
line
which
is
supported
on
the
surface
of
the
water
by
wooden
floats
while
short
lines
with
baited
hooks
attached
to
them
depend
from
it
at
frequent
intervals
the
place
where
the
fisherman
makes
his
line
whether
in
his
hut
or
his
garden
is
tabooed
people
may
not
step
over
his
cords
or
tools
and
he
himself
has
to
observe
a
number
of
restrictions
he
may
not
go
near
his
wife
or
any
other
woman
he
eats
alone
works
alone
sleeps
alone
he
may
not
wash
except
in
the
lake
he
may
not
eat
salt
or
meat
or
butter
he
may
not
smear
any
fat
on
his
body
when
the
line
is
ready
he
goes
to
the
god
asks
his
blessing
on
it
and
offers
him
a
pot
of
beer
in
return
he
receives
from
the
deity
a
stick
or
bit
of
wood
to
fasten
to
the
line
and
also
some
medicine
of
herbs
to
smoke
and
blow
over
the
water
in
order
that
the
fish
may
come
to
the
line
and
be
caught
then
he
carries
the
line
to
the
lake
if
in
going
thither
he
should
stumble
over
a
stone
or
a
he
takes
it
with
him
and
he
does
the
same
with
any
that
may
stick
to
his
clothes
these
stones
roots
and
seeds
he
puts
on
the
line
believing
that
just
as
he
stumbled
over
them
and
they
stuck
to
him
so
the
fish
will
also
stumble
over
them
and
stick
to
the
line
the
taboo
lasts
till
he
has
caught
his
first
fish
if
his
wife
has
kept
the
taboo
he
eats
the
fish
with
her
but
if
she
has
broken
it
she
may
not
partake
of
the
fish
after
that
if
he
wishes
to
go
in
to
his
wife
he
must
take
his
line
out
of
the
water
and
place
it
in
a
tree
or
some
other
place
of
safety
he
is
then
free
to
be
with
her
but
so
long
as
the
line
is
in
the
water
he
must
keep
apart
from
women
or
the
fish
would
at
once
leave
the
shore
any
breach
of
this
taboo
renders
the
line
useless
to
him
he
must
sell
it
and
make
a
new
one
and
offer
an
expiatory
offering
to
the
god
again
in
uganda
the
fisherman
offers
fish
to
his
canoe
believing
that
if
he
neglected
to
make
this
offering
more
than
twice
his
net
would
catch
nothing
the
fish
thus
offered
to
the
canoe
is
eaten
by
the
fishermen
but
if
at
the
time
of
emptying
the
traps
there
is
any
man
in
the
canoe
who
has
committed
adultery
eaten
flesh
or
salt
or
rubbed
his
body
with
butter
or
fat
that
man
is
not
allowed
to
partake
of
the
fish
offered
to
the
canoe
and
if
the
sinner
has
not
confessed
his
fault
to
the
priest
and
been
purified
the
catch
will
be
small
when
the
adulterer
has
confessed
his
sin
the
priest
calls
the
husband
of
the
guilty
woman
and
tells
him
of
her
crime
her
paramour
has
to
wear
a
sign
to
shew
that
he
is
doing
penance
and
he
makes
a
feast
for
the
injured
husband
which
the
latter
is
obliged
to
accept
in
token
of
reconciliation
after
that
the
husband
may
not
punish
either
of
the
erring
couple
the
sin
is
atoned
for
and
they
are
able
to
catch
fish
again
among
the
bangala
of
the
upper
congo
while
fishermen
are
making
their
traps
they
must
observe
strict
continence
and
the
restriction
lasts
until
the
traps
have
caught
fish
and
the
fish
have
been
eaten
similarly
bangala
hunters
may
have
no
sexual
intercourse
from
the
time
they
made
their
traps
till
they
have
caught
game
and
eaten
it
it
is
believed
that
any
hunter
who
broke
this
rule
of
chastity
would
have
bad
luck
in
the
chase
in
the
island
of
nias
the
hunters
sometimes
dig
pits
cover
them
lightly
over
with
twigs
grass
and
leaves
and
then
drive
the
game
into
them
while
they
are
engaged
in
digging
the
pits
they
have
to
observe
a
number
of
taboos
they
may
not
spit
or
the
game
would
turn
back
in
disgust
from
the
pits
they
may
not
laugh
or
the
sides
of
the
pit
would
fall
in
they
may
eat
no
salt
prepare
no
fodder
for
swine
and
in
the
pit
they
may
not
scratch
themselves
for
if
they
did
the
earth
would
be
loosened
and
would
collapse
and
the
night
after
digging
the
pit
they
may
have
no
intercourse
with
a
woman
or
all
their
labour
would
be
in
vain
this
practice
of
observing
strict
chastity
as
a
condition
of
success
in
hunting
and
fishing
is
very
common
among
rude
races
and
the
instances
of
it
which
have
been
cited
render
it
probable
that
the
rule
is
always
based
on
a
superstition
rather
than
on
a
consideration
of
the
temporary
weakness
which
a
breach
of
the
custom
may
entail
on
the
hunter
or
fisherman
in
general
it
appears
to
be
supposed
that
the
evil
effect
of
incontinence
is
not
so
much
that
it
weakens
him
as
that
for
some
reason
or
other
it
offends
the
animals
who
in
consequence
will
not
suffer
themselves
to
be
caught
in
the
motumotu
tribe
of
new
guinea
a
man
will
not
see
his
wife
the
night
before
he
starts
on
a
great
fishing
or
hunting
expedition
if
he
did
he
would
have
no
luck
in
the
motu
tribe
he
is
regarded
as
holy
that
night
and
in
the
morning
no
one
may
speak
to
him
or
call
out
his
name
in
german
east
africa
elephant
hunters
must
refrain
from
women
for
several
days
before
they
set
out
for
the
chase
we
have
seen
that
in
the
same
region
a
wife
s
infidelity
during
the
hunter
s
absence
is
believed
to
give
the
elephant
power
over
him
so
as
to
kill
or
wound
him
as
this
belief
is
clearly
a
superstition
based
on
sympathetic
magic
so
doubtless
is
the
practice
of
chastity
before
the
hunt
the
pygmies
of
the
great
african
forest
are
also
reported
to
observe
strict
continence
the
night
before
an
important
hunt
it
is
said
that
at
this
time
they
propitiate
their
ancestors
by
rubbing
their
skulls
which
they
keep
in
boxes
with
palm
oil
and
with
water
in
which
the
ashes
of
the
bark
and
leaves
of
a
certain
tree
have
been
mixed
the
huichol
indians
of
mexico
think
that
only
the
pure
of
heart
should
hunt
the
deer
the
deer
would
never
enter
a
snare
put
up
by
a
man
in
love
it
would
only
look
at
it
snort
pooh
pooh
and
go
back
the
way
it
came
good
luck
in
love
means
bad
luck
in
but
even
those
who
have
been
abstinent
must
invoke
the
aid
of
the
fire
to
burn
the
last
taint
or
blemish
out
of
them
so
the
night
before
they
set
out
for
the
chase
they
gather
round
the
fire
and
pray
aloud
all
trying
to
get
as
near
as
they
can
to
the
flaming
god
and
turning
every
side
of
their
bodies
to
his
blessed
influence
they
hold
out
their
open
hands
to
it
warm
the
palms
spit
on
them
and
then
rub
them
quickly
over
their
joints
legs
and
shoulders
as
the
shamans
do
in
curing
a
sick
man
in
order
that
their
limbs
and
sinews
may
be
as
strong
as
their
hearts
are
pure
for
the
task
of
the
morrow
a
carrier
indian
of
british
columbia
used
to
separate
from
his
wife
for
a
full
month
before
he
set
traps
for
bears
and
during
this
time
he
might
not
drink
from
the
same
vessel
as
his
wife
but
had
to
use
a
special
cup
made
of
birch
bark
the
neglect
of
these
precautions
would
cause
the
game
to
escape
after
it
had
been
snared
but
when
he
was
about
to
snare
martens
the
period
of
continence
was
cut
down
to
ten
days
the
sia
a
tribe
of
pueblo
indians
observe
chastity
for
four
days
before
a
hunt
as
well
as
the
whole
time
that
it
lasts
even
if
the
game
be
only
rabbits
among
the
tsetsaut
indians
of
british
columbia
hunters
who
desire
to
secure
good
luck
fast
and
wash
their
bodies
with
for
three
or
four
days
and
do
not
touch
a
woman
for
two
or
three
months
a
shuswap
indian
who
intends
to
go
out
hunting
must
also
keep
away
from
his
wife
or
he
would
have
no
luck
among
the
thompson
indians
the
hunter
must
abstain
from
sexual
intercourse
for
some
time
before
he
went
forth
to
hunt
these
indians
believe
that
bears
always
hear
what
is
said
of
them
hence
a
man
who
intends
to
go
must
be
very
careful
what
he
says
about
the
beasts
or
about
his
preparations
for
killing
them
or
they
will
get
wind
of
it
and
keep
out
of
his
way
in
the
same
tribe
of
indians
some
trappers
and
hunters
who
were
very
particular
would
not
eat
with
other
people
when
they
were
engaged
or
about
to
be
engaged
in
hunting
or
trapping
neither
would
they
eat
food
cooked
by
any
woman
unless
she
were
old
they
drank
cold
water
in
which
mountain
juniper
or
wild
rhubarb
had
been
soaked
using
a
cup
of
their
own
which
no
one
else
might
touch
hunters
seldom
combed
their
hair
when
they
were
on
an
expedition
but
waited
to
do
so
till
their
return
the
reason
for
this
last
rule
is
certainly
not
that
at
such
seasons
they
have
no
time
to
attend
to
their
persons
the
custom
is
probably
based
on
that
superstitious
objection
to
touch
the
heads
of
tabooed
persons
of
which
some
examples
have
already
been
given
and
of
which
more
will
be
adduced
shortly
in
the
late
autumn
or
early
winter
a
few
families
of
the
hidatsa
indians
seek
some
quiet
spot
in
the
forest
and
pitch
their
camp
there
to
catch
eagles
after
setting
up
their
tents
they
build
a
small
where
the
ceremonies
supposed
to
be
indispensable
for
trapping
the
eagles
are
performed
no
woman
may
enter
it
the
traps
are
set
on
high
places
among
the
neighbouring
hills
when
some
of
the
men
wish
to
take
part
in
the
trapping
they
fast
and
then
go
by
day
to
the
there
they
continue
without
food
until
about
midnight
when
they
partake
of
a
little
nourishment
and
fall
asleep
they
get
up
just
before
dawn
or
when
the
has
risen
and
go
to
their
traps
there
they
sit
all
day
without
food
or
drink
watching
for
their
prey
and
struggling
it
may
be
from
time
to
time
with
a
captive
eagle
for
they
always
take
the
birds
alive
they
return
to
the
camp
at
sunset
as
they
approach
every
one
rushes
into
his
tent
for
the
hunter
may
neither
see
nor
be
seen
by
any
of
his
until
he
enters
the
they
spend
the
night
in
the
lodge
and
about
midnight
eat
and
drink
for
the
first
time
since
the
previous
midnight
then
they
lie
down
to
sleep
only
to
rise
again
before
dawn
and
repair
anew
to
the
traps
if
any
one
of
them
has
caught
nothing
during
the
day
he
may
not
sleep
at
night
but
must
spend
his
time
in
loud
lamentation
and
prayer
this
routine
has
to
be
observed
by
each
hunter
for
four
days
and
four
nights
after
which
he
returns
to
his
own
tent
hungry
thirsty
and
tired
and
follows
his
ordinary
pursuits
till
he
feels
able
to
go
again
to
the
during
the
four
days
of
the
trapping
he
sees
none
of
his
family
and
speaks
to
none
of
his
friends
except
those
who
are
engaged
in
the
trapping
at
the
same
time
they
believe
that
if
any
hunter
fails
to
perform
all
these
rites
the
captive
eagle
will
get
one
of
his
claws
loose
and
tear
his
captor
s
hands
there
are
men
in
the
tribe
who
have
had
their
hands
crippled
for
life
in
that
way
it
is
obvious
that
the
severe
fasting
coupled
with
the
short
sleep
or
even
the
total
sleeplessness
of
these
can
only
impair
their
physical
vigour
and
so
far
tend
to
incapacitate
them
for
capturing
the
eagles
the
motive
of
their
behaviour
in
these
respects
is
purely
superstitious
not
rational
and
so
we
may
safely
conclude
is
the
custom
which
simultaneously
cuts
them
off
from
all
intercourse
with
their
wives
and
families
an
examination
of
all
the
many
cases
in
which
the
savage
bridles
his
passions
and
remains
chaste
from
motives
of
superstition
would
be
instructive
but
i
can
not
attempt
it
now
i
will
only
add
a
few
miscellaneous
examples
of
the
custom
before
passing
to
the
ceremonies
of
purification
which
are
observed
by
the
hunter
and
fisherman
after
the
chase
and
the
fishing
are
over
the
workers
in
the
near
siphoum
in
laos
must
abstain
from
all
sexual
relations
at
the
place
where
they
are
at
work
and
they
may
not
cover
their
heads
nor
shelter
themselves
under
an
umbrella
from
the
burning
rays
of
the
sun
among
the
kachins
of
burma
the
ferment
used
in
making
beer
is
prepared
by
two
women
chosen
by
lot
who
during
the
three
days
that
the
process
lasts
may
eat
nothing
acid
and
may
have
no
conjugal
relations
with
their
husbands
otherwise
it
is
supposed
that
the
beer
would
be
sour
among
the
masai
is
brewed
by
a
man
and
a
woman
who
live
in
a
hut
set
apart
for
them
till
the
wine
is
ready
for
drinking
but
they
are
strictly
forbidden
to
have
sexual
intercourse
with
each
other
during
this
time
it
is
deemed
essential
that
they
should
be
chaste
for
two
days
before
they
begin
to
brew
and
for
the
whole
of
the
six
days
that
the
brewing
lasts
the
masai
believe
that
were
the
couple
to
commit
a
breach
of
chastity
not
only
would
the
wine
be
undrinkable
but
the
bees
which
made
the
honey
would
fly
away
similarly
they
require
that
a
man
who
is
making
poison
should
sleep
alone
and
observe
other
taboos
which
render
him
almost
an
outcast
the
wandorobbo
a
tribe
of
the
same
region
as
the
masai
believe
that
the
mere
presence
of
a
woman
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
man
who
is
brewing
poison
would
deprive
the
poison
of
its
venom
and
that
the
same
thing
would
happen
if
the
wife
of
the
were
to
commit
adultery
while
her
husband
was
brewing
the
poison
in
this
last
case
it
is
obvious
that
a
rationalistic
explanation
of
the
taboo
is
impossible
how
could
the
loss
of
virtue
in
the
poison
be
a
physical
consequence
of
the
loss
of
virtue
in
the
s
wife
clearly
the
effect
which
the
wife
s
adultery
is
supposed
to
have
on
the
poison
is
a
case
of
sympathetic
magic
her
misconduct
sympathetically
affects
her
husband
and
his
work
at
a
distance
we
may
accordingly
infer
with
some
confidence
that
the
rule
of
continence
imposed
on
the
himself
is
also
a
simple
case
of
sympathetic
magic
and
not
as
a
civilised
reader
might
be
disposed
to
conjecture
a
wise
precaution
designed
to
prevent
him
from
accidentally
poisoning
his
wife
again
to
take
other
instances
in
the
east
indian
island
of
buru
people
smear
their
bodies
with
oil
as
a
protection
against
demons
but
in
order
that
the
charm
may
be
effective
the
oil
must
have
been
made
by
young
unmarried
girls
in
the
seranglao
and
gorong
archipelagoes
the
same
oil
is
regarded
as
an
antidote
to
poison
but
it
only
possesses
this
virtue
if
the
nuts
have
been
gathered
on
a
friday
by
a
youth
who
has
never
known
a
woman
and
if
the
oil
has
been
extracted
by
a
pure
maiden
while
a
priest
recited
the
appropriate
spells
so
in
the
marquesas
islands
when
a
woman
was
making
oil
she
was
tabooed
for
four
or
five
or
more
days
during
which
she
might
have
no
intercourse
with
her
husband
if
she
broke
this
rule
it
was
believed
that
she
would
obtain
no
oil
in
the
same
islands
when
a
man
had
placed
a
dish
of
bananas
and
in
an
oven
of
hot
stones
to
bake
over
night
he
might
not
go
in
to
his
wife
or
the
food
would
not
be
found
baked
in
the
morning
in
ancient
mexico
the
men
who
distilled
the
wine
known
as
from
the
sap
of
the
great
aloe
might
not
touch
a
woman
for
four
days
if
they
were
unchaste
they
thought
the
wine
would
be
sour
and
putrid
among
the
and
tribes
of
south
africa
when
the
site
of
a
new
village
has
been
chosen
and
the
houses
are
building
all
the
married
people
are
forbidden
to
have
conjugal
relations
with
each
other
if
it
were
discovered
that
any
couple
had
broken
this
rule
the
work
of
building
would
immediately
be
stopped
and
another
site
chosen
for
the
village
for
they
think
that
a
breach
of
chastity
would
spoil
the
village
which
was
growing
up
that
the
chief
would
grow
lean
and
perhaps
die
and
that
the
guilty
woman
would
never
bear
another
child
among
the
chams
of
when
a
dam
is
made
or
repaired
on
a
river
for
the
sake
of
irrigation
the
chief
who
offers
the
traditional
sacrifices
and
implores
the
protection
of
the
deities
on
the
work
has
to
stay
all
the
time
in
a
wretched
hovel
of
straw
taking
no
part
in
the
labour
and
observing
the
strictest
continence
for
the
people
believe
that
a
breach
of
his
chastity
would
entail
a
breach
of
the
dam
here
it
is
plain
there
can
be
no
idea
of
maintaining
the
mere
bodily
vigour
of
the
chief
for
the
accomplishment
of
a
task
in
which
he
does
not
even
bear
a
hand
in
new
caledonia
the
wizard
who
performs
certain
superstitious
ceremonies
at
the
building
and
launching
of
a
large
canoe
is
bound
to
the
most
rigorous
chastity
the
whole
time
that
the
vessel
is
on
the
stocks
among
the
natives
of
the
gazelle
peninsula
in
new
britain
men
who
are
engaged
in
making
avoid
women
and
observe
strict
continence
they
believe
that
if
a
woman
were
even
to
touch
a
it
would
catch
nothing
here
therefore
the
rule
of
continence
probably
springs
from
a
fear
of
infecting
sympathetically
the
traps
with
feminine
weakness
or
perhaps
with
menstrual
pollution
every
year
at
the
end
of
september
or
the
beginning
of
october
when
the
monsoon
is
near
an
end
a
fleet
of
large
sailing
canoes
leaves
port
moresby
and
the
neighbouring
motu
villages
of
new
guinea
on
a
trading
voyage
to
the
deltas
of
the
rivers
which
flow
into
the
papuan
gulf
the
canoes
are
laden
with
a
cargo
of
earthenware
pots
and
after
about
three
months
they
return
sailing
before
the
monsoon
and
bringing
back
a
cargo
of
sago
which
they
have
obtained
by
barter
for
their
crockery
it
is
about
the
beginning
of
the
monsoon
that
is
in
april
or
may
that
the
skippers
who
are
leading
men
in
the
villages
make
up
their
minds
to
go
on
these
trading
voyages
when
their
resolution
is
taken
they
communicate
it
to
their
wives
and
from
about
that
time
husband
and
wife
cease
to
cohabit
the
same
custom
of
conjugal
separation
is
observed
by
what
we
may
call
the
mate
or
second
in
command
of
each
vessel
but
it
is
not
till
the
month
of
august
that
the
work
of
preparing
the
canoes
for
sea
by
overhauling
and
caulking
them
is
taken
seriously
in
hand
from
that
time
both
skipper
and
mate
become
particularly
sacred
or
taboo
and
consequently
they
keep
apart
from
their
wives
more
than
ever
husband
and
wife
indeed
sleep
in
the
same
house
but
on
opposite
sides
of
it
in
speaking
of
his
wife
he
calls
her
maiden
and
she
calls
him
they
have
no
direct
conversation
or
dealings
with
each
other
if
he
wishes
to
communicate
with
her
he
does
so
through
a
third
person
usually
a
relative
of
one
of
them
both
refrain
from
washing
themselves
and
he
from
combing
his
hair
the
wife
s
position
indeed
becomes
very
much
like
that
of
a
when
the
canoe
has
been
launched
skipper
mate
and
crew
are
all
forbidden
to
touch
their
food
with
their
fingers
they
must
always
handle
it
and
convey
it
to
their
mouths
with
a
bone
fork
a
briefer
account
of
the
custom
and
superstition
had
previously
been
given
by
a
native
pastor
settled
in
the
neighbourhood
of
port
moresby
he
says
here
is
a
custom
of
parties
it
is
arranged
to
go
westward
to
procure
arrowroot
the
leader
of
the
party
sleeps
apart
from
his
wife
for
the
time
being
and
on
until
the
return
from
the
expedition
which
is
sometimes
a
term
of
five
months
they
say
if
this
is
not
done
the
canoe
of
the
chief
will
be
sunk
on
the
return
voyage
all
the
arrowroot
lost
in
the
sea
and
he
himself
covered
with
shame
he
however
who
observes
the
rule
of
returns
laden
with
arrowroot
has
not
a
drop
of
salt
water
to
injure
his
cargo
and
so
is
praised
by
his
companions
and
the
akamba
and
akikuyu
of
eastern
africa
refrain
from
the
commerce
of
the
sexes
on
a
journey
even
if
their
wives
are
with
them
in
the
caravan
and
they
observe
the
same
rule
of
chastity
so
long
as
the
cattle
are
at
pasture
that
is
from
the
time
the
herds
are
driven
out
to
graze
in
the
morning
till
they
come
back
in
the
evening
why
the
rule
should
be
in
force
just
while
the
cattle
are
at
pasture
is
not
said
but
we
may
conjecture
that
any
act
of
incontinence
at
that
time
is
somehow
supposed
on
the
principles
of
sympathetic
magic
to
affect
the
animals
injuriously
the
conjecture
is
confirmed
by
the
observation
that
among
the
akikuyu
for
eight
days
after
the
quarterly
festivals
which
they
hold
for
the
sake
of
securing
god
s
blessing
on
their
flocks
and
herds
no
commerce
is
permitted
between
the
sexes
they
think
that
any
breach
of
continence
in
these
eight
days
would
be
followed
by
a
mortality
among
the
flocks
if
the
taboos
or
abstinences
observed
by
hunters
and
fishermen
before
and
during
the
chase
are
dictated
as
we
have
seen
reason
to
believe
by
superstitious
motives
and
chiefly
by
a
dread
of
offending
or
frightening
the
spirits
of
the
creatures
whom
it
is
proposed
to
kill
we
may
expect
that
the
restraints
imposed
after
the
slaughter
has
been
perpetrated
will
be
at
least
as
stringent
the
slayer
and
his
friends
having
now
the
added
fear
of
the
angry
ghosts
of
his
victims
before
their
eyes
whereas
on
the
hypothesis
that
the
abstinences
in
question
including
those
from
food
drink
and
sleep
are
merely
salutary
precautions
for
maintaining
the
men
in
health
and
strength
to
do
their
work
it
is
obvious
that
the
observance
of
these
abstinences
or
taboos
after
the
work
is
done
that
is
when
the
game
is
killed
and
the
fish
caught
must
be
wholly
superfluous
absurd
and
inexplicable
but
as
i
shall
now
shew
these
taboos
often
continue
to
be
enforced
or
even
increased
in
stringency
after
the
death
of
the
animals
in
other
words
after
the
hunter
or
fisher
has
accomplished
his
object
by
making
his
bag
or
landing
his
fish
the
rationalistic
theory
of
them
therefore
breaks
down
entirely
the
hypothesis
of
superstition
is
clearly
the
only
one
open
to
us
among
the
inuit
or
esquimaux
of
bering
strait
the
dead
bodies
of
various
animals
must
be
treated
very
carefully
by
the
hunter
who
obtains
them
so
that
their
shades
may
not
be
offended
and
bring
bad
luck
or
even
death
upon
him
or
his
hence
the
unalit
hunter
who
has
had
a
hand
in
the
killing
of
a
white
whale
or
even
has
helped
to
take
one
from
the
net
is
not
allowed
to
do
any
work
for
the
next
four
days
that
being
the
time
during
which
the
shade
or
ghost
of
the
whale
is
supposed
to
stay
with
its
body
at
the
same
time
no
one
in
the
village
may
use
any
sharp
or
pointed
instrument
for
fear
of
wounding
the
whale
s
shade
which
is
believed
to
be
hovering
invisible
in
the
neighbourhood
and
no
loud
noise
may
be
made
lest
it
should
frighten
or
offend
the
ghost
whoever
cuts
a
whale
s
body
with
an
iron
axe
will
die
indeed
the
use
of
all
iron
instruments
is
forbidden
in
the
village
during
these
four
days
these
inuit
have
a
special
name
for
a
spot
of
ground
where
certain
things
are
tabooed
or
where
there
is
to
be
feared
any
evil
influence
caused
by
the
presence
of
offended
shades
of
men
or
animals
or
through
the
influence
of
other
supernatural
means
this
ground
is
sometimes
considered
unclean
and
to
go
upon
it
would
bring
misfortune
to
the
offender
producing
sickness
death
or
lack
of
success
in
hunting
or
fishing
the
same
term
is
also
applied
to
ground
where
certain
animals
have
been
killed
or
have
in
the
latter
case
the
ground
is
thought
to
be
dangerous
only
to
him
who
there
performs
some
forbidden
act
for
example
the
shore
where
a
dead
white
whale
has
been
beached
is
so
regarded
at
such
a
place
and
time
to
chop
wood
with
an
iron
axe
is
supposed
to
be
fatal
to
the
imprudent
person
who
chops
death
too
is
supposed
to
result
from
cutting
wood
with
an
iron
axe
where
salmon
are
being
dressed
an
old
man
at
michael
told
nelson
of
a
melancholy
case
of
this
kind
which
had
fallen
within
the
scope
of
his
own
observation
a
man
began
to
chop
a
log
near
a
woman
who
was
splitting
salmon
both
of
them
died
soon
afterwards
the
reason
of
this
disaster
as
the
old
man
explained
was
that
the
shade
or
ghost
of
the
salmon
and
the
spirit
or
mystery
of
the
ground
were
incensed
at
the
proceeding
such
offences
are
indeed
fatal
to
every
person
who
may
be
present
at
the
desecrated
spot
dogs
are
regarded
as
very
unclean
and
offensive
to
the
shades
of
game
animals
and
great
care
is
taken
that
no
dog
shall
get
at
the
bones
of
a
white
whale
should
a
dog
touch
one
of
them
the
hunter
might
lose
his
luck
his
nets
would
break
or
be
shunned
by
the
whales
and
his
spears
would
not
strike
but
in
addition
to
the
state
of
uncleanness
or
taboo
which
arises
from
the
presence
of
the
shades
of
men
or
animals
these
esquimaux
believe
in
uncleanness
of
another
sort
which
though
not
so
serious
nevertheless
produces
sickness
or
bad
luck
in
hunting
it
consists
we
are
told
of
a
kind
of
invisible
impalpable
vapour
which
may
attach
itself
to
a
person
from
some
contamination
a
hunter
infected
by
such
a
vapour
is
much
more
than
usually
visible
to
game
so
that
his
luck
in
the
chase
is
gone
until
he
succeeds
in
cleansing
himself
once
more
that
is
why
hunters
must
avoid
menstruous
women
if
they
do
not
they
will
be
unable
to
catch
game
these
same
esquimaux
of
bering
strait
celebrate
a
great
annual
festival
in
december
when
the
bladders
of
all
the
seals
whales
walrus
and
white
bears
that
have
been
killed
in
the
year
are
taken
into
the
of
the
village
they
remain
there
for
several
days
and
so
long
as
they
do
so
the
hunters
avoid
all
intercourse
with
women
saying
that
if
they
failed
in
that
respect
the
shades
of
the
dead
animals
would
be
offended
similarly
among
the
aleuts
of
alaska
the
hunter
who
had
struck
a
whale
with
a
charmed
spear
would
not
throw
again
but
returned
at
once
to
his
home
and
separated
himself
from
his
people
in
a
hut
specially
constructed
for
the
purpose
where
he
stayed
for
three
days
without
food
or
drink
and
without
touching
or
looking
upon
a
woman
during
this
time
of
seclusion
he
snorted
occasionally
in
imitation
of
the
wounded
and
dying
whale
in
order
to
prevent
the
whale
which
he
had
struck
from
leaving
the
coast
on
the
fourth
day
he
emerged
from
his
seclusion
and
bathed
in
the
sea
shrieking
in
a
hoarse
voice
and
beating
the
water
with
his
hands
then
taking
with
him
a
companion
he
repaired
to
that
part
of
the
shore
where
he
expected
to
find
the
whale
stranded
if
the
beast
was
dead
he
at
once
cut
out
the
place
where
the
had
been
inflicted
if
the
whale
was
not
dead
he
again
returned
to
his
home
and
continued
washing
himself
until
the
whale
died
here
the
hunter
s
imitation
of
the
wounded
whale
is
probably
intended
by
means
of
homoeopathic
magic
to
make
the
beast
die
in
earnest
among
the
kaniagmuts
of
alaska
the
men
who
attacked
the
whale
were
considered
by
their
countrymen
as
unclean
during
the
fishing
season
though
otherwise
they
were
held
in
high
honour
the
central
esquimaux
of
baffin
land
and
hudson
bay
think
that
whales
ground
seals
and
common
seals
originated
in
the
severed
fingers
of
the
goddess
sedna
hence
an
esquimau
of
these
regions
must
make
atonement
for
each
of
these
animals
that
he
kills
and
must
observe
strictly
certain
taboos
after
their
slaughter
some
of
the
rules
of
conduct
thus
enjoined
are
identical
with
those
which
are
in
force
after
the
death
of
a
human
being
thus
after
the
killing
of
one
of
these
as
after
the
decease
of
a
person
it
is
forbidden
to
scrape
the
frost
from
the
window
to
shake
the
bed
or
to
disturb
the
shrubs
under
the
bed
to
remove
the
drippings
of
oil
from
under
the
lamp
to
scrape
hair
from
skins
to
cut
snow
for
the
purpose
of
melting
it
to
work
on
iron
wood
stone
or
ivory
furthermore
women
are
forbidden
to
comb
their
hair
to
wash
their
faces
and
to
dry
their
boots
and
stockings
all
these
regulations
must
be
kept
with
the
greatest
care
after
a
ground
seal
has
been
killed
because
the
transgression
of
taboos
that
refer
to
this
animal
makes
the
hands
of
sedna
very
sore
when
a
seal
is
brought
into
the
hut
the
women
must
stop
working
until
it
is
cut
up
after
the
capture
of
a
ground
seal
walrus
or
whale
they
must
rest
for
three
days
not
all
kinds
of
work
however
are
forbidden
they
may
mend
articles
made
of
sealskin
but
they
may
not
make
anything
new
working
on
the
new
skins
of
caribou
the
american
reindeer
is
strictly
prohibited
for
a
series
of
rules
forbids
all
contact
between
that
animal
and
the
thus
obtained
in
summer
may
not
be
prepared
before
the
ice
has
formed
and
the
first
seal
is
caught
with
the
harpoon
later
as
soon
as
the
first
walrus
has
been
killed
the
work
must
stop
again
until
the
next
autumn
hence
everybody
is
eager
to
have
his
ready
as
quickly
as
possible
for
until
that
is
done
the
walrus
season
will
not
begin
when
the
first
walrus
has
been
killed
a
messenger
goes
from
village
to
village
and
announces
the
news
whereupon
all
work
on
immediately
ceases
on
the
other
hand
when
the
season
for
hunting
the
reindeer
begins
all
the
winter
clothing
and
the
winter
tents
that
had
been
in
use
during
the
walrus
hunting
season
become
tabooed
and
are
buried
under
stones
they
may
not
be
used
again
till
the
next
walrus
hunting
season
comes
round
no
or
thongs
made
of
such
hide
may
be
taken
inland
where
the
reindeer
live
venison
may
not
be
put
in
the
same
boat
with
nor
yet
with
salmon
if
venison
or
the
antlers
of
the
reindeer
were
in
a
boat
which
goes
the
boat
would
be
liable
to
be
broken
by
the
walrus
the
esquimaux
are
not
allowed
to
eat
venison
and
walrus
on
the
same
day
unless
they
first
strip
naked
or
put
on
clothing
of
that
has
never
been
worn
in
hunting
walrus
the
transgression
of
these
taboos
gives
umbrage
to
the
souls
of
walrus
and
a
myth
is
told
to
account
for
the
mutual
aversion
of
the
walrus
and
the
reindeer
and
in
general
the
esquimaux
say
that
sedna
dislikes
the
reindeer
wherefore
they
may
not
bring
the
beast
into
contact
with
her
favourites
the
hence
the
meat
of
the
whale
and
the
seal
as
well
as
of
the
walrus
may
not
be
eaten
on
the
same
day
with
venison
it
is
not
permitted
that
both
sorts
of
meat
lie
on
the
floor
of
the
hut
or
behind
the
lamps
at
the
same
time
if
a
man
who
has
eaten
venison
in
the
morning
happens
to
enter
a
hut
in
which
seal
meat
is
being
cooked
he
is
allowed
to
eat
venison
on
the
bed
but
it
must
be
wrapped
up
before
it
is
carried
into
the
hut
and
he
must
take
care
to
keep
clear
of
the
floor
before
they
change
from
one
food
to
the
other
the
esquimaux
must
wash
themselves
but
even
among
the
themselves
there
are
rules
of
mutual
avoidance
which
these
central
esquimaux
must
observe
thus
a
person
who
has
been
eating
or
hunting
walrus
must
strip
naked
or
change
his
clothes
before
he
eats
seal
otherwise
the
transgression
will
become
fastened
to
the
soul
of
the
walrus
in
a
manner
which
will
be
explained
presently
again
the
soul
of
a
salmon
is
very
powerful
and
its
body
may
not
be
eaten
on
the
same
day
with
walrus
or
venison
salmon
may
not
be
cooked
in
a
pot
that
has
been
used
to
boil
any
other
kind
of
meat
and
it
must
always
be
cooked
at
some
distance
from
the
hut
the
is
not
allowed
to
wear
boots
that
have
been
used
in
hunting
walrus
and
no
work
may
be
done
on
till
the
first
salmon
has
been
caught
and
put
on
a
once
more
the
soul
of
the
grim
polar
bear
is
offended
if
the
taboos
which
concern
him
are
not
observed
his
soul
tarries
for
three
days
near
the
spot
where
it
left
his
body
and
during
these
days
the
esquimaux
are
particularly
careful
to
conform
rigidly
to
the
laws
of
taboo
because
they
believe
that
punishment
overtakes
the
transgressor
who
sins
against
the
soul
of
a
bear
far
more
speedily
than
him
who
sins
against
the
souls
of
the
the
native
explanation
of
the
taboos
thus
enjoined
on
hunters
among
the
central
esquimaux
has
been
given
us
by
the
eminent
american
ethnologist
franz
boas
as
it
sets
what
may
be
called
the
spiritual
basis
of
taboo
in
the
clearest
light
it
deserves
to
be
studied
with
attention
the
goddess
sedna
he
tells
us
the
mother
of
the
may
be
considered
to
be
the
chief
deity
of
the
central
esquimaux
she
is
supposed
to
bear
supreme
sway
over
the
destinies
of
mankind
and
almost
all
the
observances
of
these
tribes
have
for
their
object
to
retain
her
good
will
or
appease
her
anger
her
home
is
in
the
lower
world
where
she
dwells
in
a
house
built
of
stone
and
the
souls
of
seals
ground
seals
and
whales
are
believed
to
proceed
from
her
house
after
one
of
these
animals
has
been
killed
its
soul
stays
with
the
body
for
three
days
then
it
goes
back
to
sedna
s
abode
to
be
sent
forth
again
by
her
if
during
the
three
days
that
the
soul
stays
with
the
body
any
taboo
or
proscribed
custom
is
violated
the
violation
becomes
attached
to
the
animal
s
soul
and
causes
it
pain
the
soul
strives
in
vain
to
free
itself
of
these
attachments
but
is
compelled
to
take
them
down
to
sedna
the
attachments
in
some
manner
not
explained
make
her
hands
sore
and
she
punishes
the
people
who
are
the
cause
of
her
pains
by
sending
to
them
sickness
bad
weather
and
starvation
if
on
the
other
hand
all
taboos
have
been
observed
the
will
allow
themselves
to
be
caught
they
will
even
come
to
meet
the
hunter
the
object
of
the
innumerable
taboos
that
are
in
force
after
the
killing
of
these
therefore
is
to
keep
their
souls
free
from
attachments
that
would
hurt
their
souls
as
well
as
sedna
the
souls
of
the
are
endowed
with
greater
powers
than
those
of
ordinary
human
beings
they
can
see
the
effect
of
contact
with
a
corpse
which
causes
objects
touched
by
it
to
appear
dark
in
colour
and
they
can
see
the
effect
of
flowing
human
blood
from
which
a
vapour
rises
that
surrounds
the
bleeding
person
and
is
communicated
to
every
one
and
every
thing
that
comes
in
contact
with
such
a
person
this
vapour
and
the
dark
colour
of
death
are
exceedingly
unpleasant
to
the
souls
of
the
that
will
not
come
near
a
hunter
thus
affected
the
hunter
must
therefore
avoid
contact
with
people
who
have
touched
a
body
or
with
those
who
are
bleeding
more
particularly
with
menstruating
women
or
with
those
who
have
recently
given
birth
the
hands
of
menstruating
women
appear
red
to
the
if
any
one
who
has
touched
a
body
or
who
is
bleeding
should
allow
others
to
come
in
contact
with
him
he
would
cause
them
to
become
distasteful
to
the
seals
and
therefore
to
sedna
as
well
for
this
reason
custom
demands
that
every
person
must
at
once
announce
if
he
has
touched
a
body
and
that
women
must
make
known
when
they
are
menstruating
or
when
they
have
had
a
miscarriage
if
they
do
not
do
so
they
will
bring
to
all
the
hunters
these
ideas
have
given
rise
to
the
belief
that
it
is
necessary
to
announce
the
transgression
of
any
taboo
the
transgressor
of
a
custom
is
distasteful
to
sedna
and
to
the
animals
and
those
who
abide
with
him
will
become
equally
distasteful
through
contact
with
him
for
this
reason
it
has
come
to
be
an
act
required
by
custom
and
morals
to
confess
any
and
every
transgression
of
a
taboo
in
order
to
protect
the
community
from
the
evil
influence
of
contact
with
the
the
descriptions
of
eskimo
life
given
by
many
observers
contain
records
of
starvation
which
according
to
the
belief
of
the
natives
was
brought
about
by
some
one
transgressing
a
law
and
not
announcing
what
he
had
done
i
presume
the
importance
of
the
confession
of
a
transgression
with
a
view
to
warning
others
to
keep
at
a
distance
from
the
transgressor
has
gradually
led
to
the
idea
that
a
transgression
or
we
might
say
a
sin
can
be
atoned
for
by
confession
this
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
traits
among
the
religious
beliefs
of
the
central
eskimo
there
are
innumerable
tales
of
starvation
brought
about
by
the
transgression
of
a
taboo
in
vain
the
hunters
try
to
supply
their
families
with
food
gales
and
drifting
snow
make
their
endeavours
fruitless
finally
the
help
of
the
is
invoked
and
he
discovers
that
the
cause
of
the
misfortune
of
the
people
is
due
to
the
transgression
of
a
taboo
then
the
guilty
one
is
searched
for
if
he
confesses
all
is
well
the
weather
moderates
and
the
seals
allow
themselves
to
be
caught
but
if
he
obstinately
maintains
his
innocence
his
death
alone
will
soothe
the
wrath
of
the
offended
deity
the
transgressions
of
taboos
do
not
affect
the
souls
of
game
alone
it
has
already
been
stated
that
the
see
their
effect
upon
man
also
who
appears
to
them
of
a
dark
colour
or
surrounded
by
a
vapour
which
is
invisible
to
ordinary
man
this
means
of
course
that
the
transgression
also
affects
the
soul
of
the
it
becomes
attached
to
it
and
makes
him
sick
the
is
able
to
see
these
attachments
with
the
help
of
his
guardian
spirit
and
is
able
to
free
the
soul
from
them
if
this
is
not
done
the
person
must
die
in
many
cases
the
transgressions
become
fastened
also
to
persons
who
come
in
contact
with
the
this
is
especially
true
of
children
to
whose
souls
the
sins
of
their
parents
and
particularly
of
their
mothers
become
readily
attached
therefore
when
a
child
is
sick
the
first
of
all
asks
its
mother
if
she
has
transgressed
any
taboos
the
attachment
seems
to
have
a
different
appearance
according
to
the
taboo
that
has
been
violated
a
black
attachment
is
due
to
removing
from
under
the
lamp
a
piece
of
represents
the
scrapings
removed
from
a
at
a
time
when
such
work
was
forbidden
as
soon
as
the
mother
acknowledges
the
transgression
of
a
taboo
the
attachment
leaves
the
child
s
soul
and
the
child
recovers
a
number
of
customs
may
be
explained
by
the
endeavours
of
the
natives
to
keep
the
free
from
contaminating
influences
all
the
clothing
of
a
dead
person
the
tent
in
which
he
died
and
the
skins
obtained
by
him
must
be
discarded
for
if
a
hunter
should
wear
clothing
made
of
skins
that
had
been
in
contact
with
the
deceased
these
would
appear
dark
and
the
seal
would
avoid
him
neither
would
a
seal
allow
itself
to
be
taken
into
a
hut
darkened
by
a
dead
body
and
all
those
who
entered
such
a
hut
would
appear
dark
to
it
and
would
be
avoided
while
it
is
customary
for
a
successful
hunter
to
invite
all
the
men
of
the
village
to
eat
of
the
seal
that
he
has
caught
they
must
not
take
any
of
the
out
of
the
hut
because
it
might
come
in
contact
with
persons
who
are
under
taboo
and
thus
the
hunter
might
incur
the
displeasure
of
the
seal
and
of
sedna
this
is
particularly
strictly
forbidden
in
the
case
of
the
first
seal
of
the
season
a
woman
who
has
a
child
and
who
has
not
quite
recovered
must
eat
only
of
seals
caught
by
her
husband
by
a
boy
or
by
an
aged
man
else
the
vapour
arising
from
her
body
would
become
attached
to
the
souls
of
other
seals
which
would
take
the
transgression
down
to
sedna
thus
making
her
hands
sore
cases
of
premature
birth
require
particularly
careful
treatment
the
event
must
be
announced
publicly
else
dire
results
will
follow
if
a
woman
should
conceal
from
the
other
people
that
she
has
had
a
premature
birth
they
might
come
near
her
or
even
eat
in
her
hut
of
the
seals
procured
by
her
husband
the
vapour
arising
from
her
would
thus
affect
them
and
they
would
be
avoided
by
the
seals
the
transgression
would
also
become
attached
to
the
soul
of
the
seal
which
would
take
it
down
to
in
these
elaborate
taboos
so
well
described
by
boas
we
seem
to
see
a
system
of
animism
in
the
act
of
passing
into
religion
the
rules
themselves
bear
the
clearest
traces
of
having
originated
in
a
doctrine
of
souls
and
of
being
determined
by
the
supposed
likes
and
dislikes
sympathies
and
antipathies
of
the
various
classes
of
spirits
toward
each
other
but
above
and
behind
the
souls
of
men
and
animals
has
grown
up
the
overshadowing
conception
of
a
powerful
goddess
who
rules
them
all
so
that
the
taboos
come
more
and
more
to
be
viewed
as
a
means
of
propitiating
her
rather
than
as
merely
adapted
to
suit
the
tastes
of
the
souls
themselves
thus
the
standard
of
conduct
is
shifted
from
a
natural
to
a
supernatural
basis
the
supposed
wish
of
the
deity
or
as
we
commonly
put
it
the
will
of
god
tends
to
supersede
the
wishes
real
or
imaginative
of
purely
natural
beings
as
the
measure
of
right
and
wrong
the
old
savage
taboos
resting
on
a
theory
of
the
direct
relations
of
living
creatures
to
each
other
remain
in
substance
unchanged
but
they
are
outwardly
transformed
into
ethical
precepts
with
a
religious
or
supernatural
sanction
in
this
gradual
passage
of
a
rude
philosophy
into
an
elementary
religion
the
place
occupied
by
confession
as
a
moral
purgative
is
particularly
interesting
i
can
hardly
agree
with
boas
that
among
these
esquimaux
the
confession
of
sins
was
in
its
origin
no
more
than
a
means
of
warning
others
against
the
dangerous
contagion
of
the
sinner
in
other
words
that
its
saving
efficacy
consisted
merely
in
preventing
the
innocent
from
suffering
with
the
guilty
and
that
it
had
no
healing
virtue
no
purifying
influence
for
the
himself
it
seems
more
probable
that
originally
the
violation
of
taboo
in
other
words
the
sin
was
conceived
as
something
almost
physical
a
sort
of
morbid
substance
lurking
in
the
sinner
s
body
from
which
it
could
be
expelled
by
confession
as
by
a
sort
of
spiritual
purge
or
emetic
this
is
confirmed
by
the
form
of
auricular
confession
which
is
practised
by
the
akikuyu
of
british
east
africa
amongst
them
we
are
told
sin
is
essentially
remissable
it
suffices
to
confess
it
usually
this
is
done
to
the
sorcerer
who
expels
the
sin
by
a
ceremony
of
which
the
principal
rite
is
a
pretended
emetic
derived
from
to
thus
among
these
savages
the
confession
and
absolution
of
sins
is
so
to
say
a
purely
physical
process
of
relieving
a
sufferer
of
a
burden
which
sits
heavy
on
his
stomach
rather
than
on
his
conscience
this
view
of
the
matter
is
again
confirmed
by
the
observation
that
these
same
akikuyu
resort
to
another
physical
mode
of
expelling
sin
from
a
sinner
and
that
is
by
the
employment
of
a
scapegoat
which
by
them
as
by
the
jews
and
many
other
people
has
been
employed
as
a
vehicle
for
carting
away
moral
rubbish
and
dumping
it
somewhere
else
for
example
if
a
kikuyu
man
has
committed
incest
which
would
naturally
entail
his
death
he
produces
a
substitute
in
the
shape
of
a
to
which
by
an
ignoble
ceremony
he
transfers
his
guilt
then
the
throat
of
the
animal
is
cut
and
the
human
culprit
is
thereby
purged
of
his
sin
hence
we
may
suspect
that
the
primary
motive
of
the
confession
of
sins
among
savages
was
in
other
words
the
intention
was
rather
to
benefit
the
sinner
himself
than
to
safeguard
others
by
warning
them
of
the
danger
they
would
incur
by
coming
into
contact
with
him
this
view
is
borne
out
by
the
observation
that
confession
is
sometimes
used
as
a
means
of
healing
the
sick
transgressor
himself
who
is
supposed
to
recover
as
soon
as
he
has
made
a
clean
breast
of
his
transgression
thus
when
the
carriers
are
severely
sick
they
often
think
that
they
shall
not
recover
unless
they
divulge
to
a
priest
or
magician
every
crime
which
they
may
have
committed
which
has
hitherto
been
kept
secret
in
such
a
case
they
will
make
a
full
confession
and
then
they
expect
that
their
lives
will
be
spared
for
a
time
longer
but
should
they
keep
back
a
single
crime
they
as
firmly
believe
that
they
shall
suffer
almost
instant
again
the
aurohuaca
indians
who
under
the
tropical
sun
of
south
america
inhabit
a
chilly
region
bordering
on
the
perpetual
snows
of
the
sierra
nevada
in
colombia
believe
that
all
sickness
is
a
punishment
for
sin
so
when
one
of
their
is
summoned
to
a
sick
bed
he
does
not
enquire
after
the
patient
s
symptoms
but
makes
strange
passes
over
him
and
asks
in
a
sepulchral
voice
whether
he
will
confess
his
sins
if
the
sick
man
persists
in
drawing
a
veil
of
silence
over
his
frailties
the
doctor
will
not
attempt
to
treat
him
but
will
turn
on
his
heel
and
leave
the
house
on
the
other
hand
if
a
satisfactory
confession
has
been
made
the
leech
directs
the
patient
s
friends
to
procure
certain
bits
of
stone
or
shell
to
which
the
sins
of
the
sufferer
may
be
transferred
for
when
that
is
done
he
will
be
made
whole
for
this
purpose
the
stones
or
shells
are
carried
high
up
into
the
mountains
and
laid
in
some
spot
where
the
first
beams
of
the
sun
rising
in
clear
or
clouded
majesty
above
the
long
white
slopes
or
the
towering
crags
of
the
sierra
nevada
will
strike
down
on
them
driving
sin
and
sickness
far
away
by
their
radiant
influence
here
again
we
see
that
sin
is
regarded
as
something
almost
material
which
by
confession
can
be
removed
from
the
body
of
the
patient
and
laid
on
stones
or
shells
further
the
confession
of
sins
has
been
resorted
to
by
some
people
as
a
means
of
accelerating
the
birth
of
a
child
when
the
mother
was
in
hard
labour
thus
among
the
indians
of
guatemala
in
the
time
of
their
idolatry
when
a
woman
was
in
labour
the
midwife
ordered
her
to
confess
her
sins
and
if
she
was
not
delivered
the
husband
was
to
confess
his
and
if
that
did
not
do
they
took
off
his
clouts
and
put
them
about
his
wife
s
loins
if
still
she
could
not
be
delivered
the
midwife
drew
blood
from
herself
and
sprinkled
it
towards
the
four
quarters
of
heaven
with
some
invocations
and
in
these
attempts
of
the
indians
to
accelerate
the
birth
of
the
child
it
seems
clear
that
the
confession
of
sins
on
the
part
first
of
the
wife
and
afterwards
of
the
husband
is
nothing
but
a
magical
ceremony
like
the
putting
of
the
husband
s
clothes
on
the
suffering
woman
or
the
sprinkling
of
the
midwife
s
blood
towards
the
four
quarters
of
the
heaven
amongst
the
antambahoaka
a
savage
tribe
of
madagascar
when
a
woman
is
in
hard
labour
a
sorcerer
is
called
in
to
her
aid
after
making
some
magical
signs
and
uttering
some
incantations
he
generally
declares
that
the
patient
can
not
be
delivered
until
she
has
publicly
confessed
a
secret
fault
which
she
has
committed
in
such
a
case
a
woman
has
been
known
to
confess
to
incest
with
her
brother
and
immediately
after
her
confession
the
child
was
born
in
these
cases
the
confession
of
sins
is
clearly
not
a
mode
of
warning
people
to
keep
clear
of
the
sinner
it
is
a
magical
ceremony
primarily
intended
to
benefit
the
sinner
himself
or
herself
and
no
other
the
same
thing
may
perhaps
be
said
of
a
confession
which
was
prescribed
in
a
certain
case
by
ancient
hindoo
ritual
at
a
great
festival
of
varuna
which
fell
at
the
beginning
of
the
rainy
season
the
priest
asked
the
wife
of
the
sacrificer
to
name
her
paramour
or
paramours
and
she
had
to
mention
their
names
or
at
least
to
take
up
as
many
as
she
had
lovers
now
when
a
woman
who
belongs
to
one
man
carries
on
intercourse
with
another
she
undoubtedly
commits
a
sin
against
varuna
he
therefore
thus
asks
her
lest
she
should
sacrifice
with
a
secret
pang
in
her
mind
for
when
confessed
the
sin
becomes
less
since
it
becomes
truth
this
is
why
he
thus
asks
her
and
whatever
connection
she
confesses
not
that
indeed
will
turn
out
injurious
to
her
in
this
passage
of
the
confession
of
sin
is
said
to
diminish
the
sin
just
as
if
the
mere
utterance
of
the
words
ejected
or
expelled
some
morbid
matter
from
the
person
of
the
sinner
thereby
relieving
her
of
its
burden
and
benefiting
also
her
relatives
who
would
suffer
through
any
sin
which
she
might
not
have
confessed
thus
at
an
early
stage
of
culture
the
confession
of
sins
wears
the
aspect
of
a
bodily
rather
than
of
a
moral
and
spiritual
purgation
it
is
a
magical
rather
than
a
religious
rite
and
as
such
it
resembles
the
ceremonies
of
washing
scouring
fumigation
and
so
forth
which
in
like
manner
are
applied
by
many
primitive
peoples
to
the
purification
of
what
we
should
regard
as
moral
guilt
but
what
they
consider
rather
as
a
corporeal
pollution
or
infection
which
can
be
removed
by
the
physical
agencies
of
fire
water
fasts
purgatives
abrasion
scarification
and
so
forth
but
when
the
guilt
of
sin
ceases
to
be
regarded
as
something
material
a
sort
of
clinging
vapour
of
death
and
is
conceived
as
the
transgression
of
the
will
of
a
wise
and
good
god
it
is
obvious
that
the
observance
of
these
outward
rites
of
purification
becomes
superfluous
and
absurd
a
vain
show
which
can
not
appease
the
anger
of
the
offended
deity
the
only
means
of
turning
away
his
wrath
and
averting
the
fatal
consequences
of
sin
is
now
believed
to
be
the
humble
confession
and
true
repentance
of
the
sinner
at
this
stage
of
ethical
evolution
the
practice
of
confession
loses
its
old
magical
character
as
a
bodily
purge
and
assumes
the
new
aspect
of
a
purely
religious
rite
the
propitiation
of
a
great
supernatural
and
moral
being
who
by
a
simple
fiat
can
cancel
the
transgression
and
restore
the
transgressor
to
a
state
of
pristine
innocence
this
comfortable
doctrine
teaches
us
that
in
order
to
blot
out
the
effects
of
our
misdeeds
we
have
only
to
acknowledge
and
confess
them
with
a
lowly
and
penitent
heart
whereupon
a
merciful
god
will
graciously
pardon
our
sin
and
absolve
us
and
ours
from
its
consequences
it
might
indeed
be
well
for
the
world
if
we
could
thus
easily
undo
the
past
if
we
could
recall
the
words
that
have
been
spoken
amiss
if
we
could
arrest
the
long
train
that
follows
like
a
flight
of
avenging
furies
on
every
evil
action
but
this
we
can
not
do
our
words
and
acts
good
and
bad
have
their
natural
their
inevitable
consequences
god
may
pardon
sin
but
nature
can
not
it
seems
not
improbable
that
in
our
own
rules
of
conduct
in
what
we
call
the
common
decencies
of
life
as
well
as
in
the
weightier
matters
of
morality
there
may
survive
not
a
few
old
savage
taboos
which
masquerading
as
an
expression
of
the
divine
will
or
draped
in
the
flowing
robes
of
a
false
philosophy
have
maintained
their
credit
long
after
the
crude
ideas
out
of
which
they
sprang
have
been
discarded
by
the
progress
of
thought
and
knowledge
while
on
the
other
hand
many
ethical
precepts
and
social
laws
which
now
rest
firmly
on
a
solid
basis
of
utility
may
at
first
have
drawn
some
portion
of
their
sanctity
from
the
same
ancient
system
of
superstition
for
example
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
in
primitive
society
the
crime
of
murder
derived
much
of
its
horror
from
a
fear
of
the
angry
ghost
of
the
murdered
man
thus
superstition
may
serve
as
a
convenient
crutch
to
morality
till
she
is
strong
enough
to
throw
away
the
crutch
and
walk
alone
to
judge
by
the
legislation
of
the
pentateuch
the
ancient
semites
appear
to
have
passed
through
a
course
of
moral
evolution
not
unlike
that
which
we
can
still
detect
in
process
among
the
esquimaux
of
baffin
land
some
of
the
old
laws
of
israel
are
clearly
savage
taboos
of
a
familiar
type
thinly
disguised
as
commands
of
the
deity
this
disguise
is
indeed
a
good
deal
more
perfect
in
palestine
than
in
baffin
land
but
in
substance
it
is
the
same
among
the
esquimaux
it
is
the
will
of
sedna
among
the
israelites
it
is
the
will
of
jehovah
but
it
is
time
to
return
to
our
immediate
subject
to
wit
the
rules
of
conduct
observed
by
hunters
after
the
slaughter
of
the
game
when
the
kayans
or
bahaus
of
central
borneo
have
shot
one
of
the
dreaded
bornean
panthers
they
are
very
anxious
about
the
safety
of
their
souls
for
they
think
that
the
soul
of
a
panther
is
almost
more
powerful
than
their
own
hence
they
step
eight
times
over
the
carcase
of
the
dead
beast
reciting
the
spell
panther
thy
soul
under
my
on
returning
home
they
smear
themselves
their
dogs
and
their
weapons
with
the
blood
of
fowls
in
order
to
calm
their
souls
and
hinder
them
from
fleeing
away
for
being
themselves
fond
of
the
flesh
of
fowls
they
ascribe
the
same
taste
to
their
souls
for
eight
days
afterwards
they
must
bathe
by
day
and
by
night
before
going
out
again
to
the
chase
after
killing
an
animal
some
indian
hunters
used
to
purify
themselves
in
water
as
a
religious
rite
when
a
damara
hunter
returns
from
a
successful
chase
he
takes
water
in
his
mouth
and
ejects
it
three
times
over
his
feet
and
also
into
the
fire
on
his
own
hearth
amongst
the
caffres
of
south
africa
the
slaughter
of
a
lion
however
honourable
it
is
esteemed
is
nevertheless
associated
with
an
idea
of
moral
uncleanness
and
is
followed
by
a
very
strange
ceremony
when
the
hunters
approach
the
village
on
their
return
the
man
who
gave
the
lion
the
first
wound
is
hidden
from
every
eye
by
the
shields
which
his
comrades
hold
up
before
him
one
of
the
hunters
steps
forward
and
leaping
and
bounding
in
a
strange
manner
praises
the
courage
of
the
then
he
rejoins
the
band
and
the
same
performance
is
repeated
by
another
all
the
rest
meanwhile
keep
up
a
ceaseless
shouting
rattling
with
their
clubs
on
their
shields
this
goes
on
till
they
have
reached
the
village
then
a
mean
hut
is
run
up
not
far
from
the
village
and
in
this
hut
the
because
he
is
unclean
must
remain
four
days
cut
off
from
all
association
with
the
tribe
there
he
dyes
his
body
all
over
with
white
paint
and
lads
who
have
not
yet
been
circumcised
and
are
therefore
in
respect
to
uncleanness
in
the
same
state
as
himself
bring
him
a
calf
to
eat
and
wait
upon
him
when
the
four
days
are
over
the
unclean
man
washes
himself
paints
himself
with
red
paint
in
the
usual
manner
and
is
escorted
back
to
the
village
by
the
head
chief
attended
with
a
guard
of
honour
lastly
a
second
calf
is
killed
and
the
uncleanness
being
now
at
an
end
every
one
is
free
to
eat
of
the
calf
with
among
the
hottentots
when
a
man
has
killed
a
lion
leopard
elephant
or
rhinoceros
he
is
esteemed
a
great
hero
but
he
is
deluged
with
urine
by
the
and
has
to
remain
at
home
quite
idle
for
three
days
during
which
his
wife
may
not
come
near
him
she
is
also
enjoined
to
restrict
herself
to
a
poor
diet
and
to
eat
no
more
than
is
barely
necessary
to
keep
her
in
health
similarly
the
lapps
deem
it
the
height
of
glory
to
kill
a
bear
which
they
consider
the
king
of
beasts
nevertheless
all
the
men
who
take
part
in
the
slaughter
are
regarded
as
unclean
and
must
live
by
themselves
for
three
days
in
a
hut
or
tent
made
specially
for
them
where
they
cut
up
and
cook
the
bear
s
carcase
the
reindeer
which
brought
in
the
carcase
on
a
sledge
may
not
be
driven
by
a
woman
for
a
whole
year
indeed
according
to
one
account
it
may
not
be
used
by
anybody
for
that
period
before
the
men
go
into
the
tent
where
they
are
to
be
secluded
they
strip
themselves
of
the
garments
they
had
worn
in
killing
the
bear
and
their
wives
spit
the
red
juice
of
alder
bark
in
their
faces
they
enter
the
tent
not
by
the
ordinary
door
but
by
an
opening
at
the
back
when
the
bear
s
flesh
has
been
cooked
a
portion
of
it
is
sent
by
the
hands
of
two
men
to
the
women
who
may
not
approach
the
men
s
tent
while
the
cooking
is
going
on
the
men
who
convey
the
flesh
to
the
women
pretend
to
be
strangers
bringing
presents
from
a
foreign
land
the
women
keep
up
the
pretence
and
promise
to
tie
red
threads
round
the
legs
of
the
strangers
the
bear
s
flesh
may
not
be
passed
in
to
the
women
through
the
door
of
their
tent
but
must
be
thrust
in
at
a
special
opening
made
by
lifting
up
the
hem
of
the
when
the
three
days
seclusion
is
over
and
the
men
are
at
liberty
to
return
to
their
wives
they
run
one
after
the
other
round
the
fire
holding
the
chain
by
which
pots
are
suspended
over
it
this
is
regarded
as
a
form
of
purification
they
may
now
leave
the
tent
by
the
ordinary
door
and
rejoin
the
women
but
the
leader
of
the
party
must
still
abstain
from
cohabitation
with
his
wife
for
two
days
more
again
the
caffres
are
said
to
dread
greatly
the
or
an
enormous
serpent
resembling
it
and
being
influenced
by
certain
superstitious
notions
they
even
fear
to
kill
it
the
man
who
happened
to
put
it
to
death
whether
in
or
otherwise
was
formerly
required
to
lie
in
a
running
stream
of
water
during
the
day
for
several
weeks
together
and
no
beast
whatever
was
allowed
to
be
slaughtered
at
the
hamlet
to
which
he
belonged
until
this
duty
had
been
fully
performed
the
body
of
the
snake
was
then
taken
and
carefully
buried
in
a
trench
dug
close
to
the
where
its
remains
like
those
of
a
chief
were
henceforward
kept
perfectly
undisturbed
the
period
of
penance
as
in
the
case
of
mourning
for
the
dead
is
now
happily
reduced
to
a
few
amongst
the
peoples
of
the
slave
coast
who
worship
the
python
a
native
who
killed
one
of
these
serpents
used
to
be
burned
alive
but
for
some
time
past
though
a
semblance
of
carrying
out
the
old
penalty
is
preserved
the
culprit
is
allowed
to
escape
with
his
life
but
he
has
to
pay
a
heavy
fine
a
small
hut
of
dry
faggots
and
grass
is
set
up
generally
near
the
lagoon
at
whydah
if
the
crime
has
been
perpetrated
there
the
guilty
man
is
thrust
inside
the
door
of
plaited
grass
is
shut
on
him
and
the
hut
is
set
on
fire
sometimes
a
dog
a
kid
and
two
fowls
are
enclosed
along
with
him
and
he
is
drenched
with
and
yeast
probably
to
render
him
the
more
combustible
as
he
is
unbound
he
easily
breaks
out
of
the
frail
hut
before
the
flames
consume
him
but
he
has
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
angry
who
belabour
the
murderer
of
their
god
with
sticks
and
pelt
him
with
clods
until
he
reaches
water
and
plunges
into
it
which
is
supposed
to
wash
away
his
sin
thirteen
days
later
a
commemoration
service
is
held
in
honour
of
the
deceased
python
in
madras
it
is
considered
a
great
sin
to
kill
a
cobra
when
this
has
happened
the
people
generally
burn
the
body
of
the
serpent
just
as
they
burn
the
bodies
of
human
beings
the
murderer
deems
himself
polluted
for
three
days
on
the
second
day
milk
is
poured
on
the
remains
of
the
cobra
on
the
third
day
the
guilty
wretch
is
free
from
pollution
under
native
rule
we
may
suspect
he
would
not
get
off
so
lightly
in
these
last
cases
the
animal
whose
slaughter
has
to
be
atoned
for
is
sacred
that
is
it
is
one
whose
life
is
commonly
spared
from
motives
of
superstition
yet
the
treatment
of
the
sacrilegious
slayer
seems
to
resemble
so
closely
the
treatment
of
hunters
and
fishermen
who
have
killed
animals
for
food
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
that
the
ideas
on
which
both
sets
of
customs
are
based
may
be
assumed
to
be
substantially
the
same
those
ideas
if
i
am
right
are
the
respect
which
the
savage
feels
for
the
souls
of
beasts
especially
valuable
or
formidable
beasts
and
the
dread
which
he
entertains
of
their
vengeful
ghosts
some
confirmation
of
this
view
may
be
drawn
from
the
ceremonies
observed
by
fishermen
of
annam
when
the
carcase
of
a
whale
is
washed
ashore
these
fisherfolk
we
are
told
worship
the
whale
on
account
of
the
benefits
they
derive
from
it
there
is
hardly
a
village
on
the
which
has
not
its
small
pagoda
containing
the
bones
more
or
less
authentic
of
a
whale
when
a
dead
whale
is
washed
ashore
the
people
accord
it
a
solemn
burial
the
man
who
first
caught
sight
of
it
acts
as
chief
mourner
performing
the
rites
which
as
chief
mourner
and
heir
he
would
perform
for
a
human
kinsman
he
puts
on
all
the
garb
of
woe
the
straw
hat
the
white
robe
with
long
sleeves
turned
inside
out
and
the
other
paraphernalia
of
full
mourning
as
next
of
kin
to
the
deceased
he
presides
over
the
funeral
rites
perfumes
are
burned
sticks
of
incense
kindled
leaves
of
gold
and
silver
scattered
crackers
let
off
when
the
flesh
has
been
cut
off
and
the
oil
extracted
the
remains
of
the
carcase
are
buried
in
the
sand
afterwards
a
shed
is
set
up
and
offerings
are
made
in
it
usually
some
time
after
the
burial
the
spirit
of
the
dead
whale
takes
possession
of
some
person
in
the
village
and
declares
by
his
mouth
whether
he
is
a
male
or
a
female
chapter
tabooed
things
the
meaning
of
taboo
thus
in
primitive
society
the
rules
of
ceremonial
purity
observed
by
divine
kings
chiefs
and
priests
agree
in
many
respects
with
the
rules
observed
by
homicides
mourners
women
in
childbed
girls
at
puberty
hunters
and
fishermen
and
so
on
to
us
these
various
classes
of
persons
appear
to
differ
totally
in
character
and
condition
some
of
them
we
should
call
holy
others
we
might
pronounce
unclean
and
polluted
but
the
savage
makes
no
such
moral
distinction
between
them
the
conceptions
of
holiness
and
pollution
are
not
yet
differentiated
in
his
mind
to
him
the
common
feature
of
all
these
persons
is
that
they
are
dangerous
and
in
danger
and
the
danger
in
which
they
stand
and
to
which
they
expose
others
is
what
we
should
call
spiritual
or
ghostly
and
therefore
imaginary
the
danger
however
is
not
less
real
because
it
is
imaginary
imagination
acts
upon
man
as
really
as
does
gravitation
and
may
kill
him
as
certainly
as
a
dose
of
prussic
acid
to
seclude
these
persons
from
the
rest
of
the
world
so
that
the
dreaded
spiritual
danger
shall
neither
reach
them
nor
spread
from
them
is
the
object
of
the
taboos
which
they
have
to
observe
these
taboos
act
so
to
say
as
electrical
insulators
to
preserve
the
spiritual
force
with
which
these
persons
are
charged
from
suffering
or
inflicting
harm
by
contact
with
the
outer
world
to
the
illustrations
of
these
general
principles
which
have
been
already
given
i
shall
now
add
some
more
drawing
my
examples
first
from
the
class
of
tabooed
things
and
second
from
the
class
of
tabooed
words
for
in
the
opinion
of
the
savage
both
things
and
words
may
like
persons
be
charged
or
electrified
either
temporarily
or
permanently
with
the
mysterious
virtue
of
taboo
and
may
therefore
require
to
be
banished
for
a
longer
or
shorter
time
from
the
familiar
usage
of
common
life
and
the
examples
will
be
chosen
with
special
reference
to
those
sacred
chiefs
kings
and
priests
who
more
than
anybody
else
live
fenced
about
by
taboo
as
by
a
wall
tabooed
things
will
be
illustrated
in
the
present
chapter
and
tabooed
words
in
the
next
iron
tabooed
in
the
first
place
we
may
observe
that
the
awful
sanctity
of
kings
naturally
leads
to
a
prohibition
to
touch
their
sacred
persons
thus
it
was
unlawful
to
lay
hands
on
the
person
of
a
spartan
king
no
one
might
touch
the
body
of
the
king
or
queen
of
tahiti
it
is
forbidden
to
touch
the
person
of
the
king
of
siam
under
pain
of
death
and
no
one
may
touch
the
king
of
cambodia
for
any
purpose
whatever
without
his
express
command
in
july
the
king
was
thrown
from
his
carriage
and
lay
insensible
on
the
ground
but
not
one
of
his
suite
dared
to
touch
him
a
european
coming
to
the
spot
carried
the
injured
monarch
to
his
palace
formerly
no
one
might
touch
the
king
of
corea
and
if
he
deigned
to
touch
a
subject
the
spot
touched
became
sacred
and
the
person
thus
honoured
had
to
wear
a
visible
mark
generally
a
cord
of
red
silk
for
the
rest
of
his
life
above
all
no
iron
might
touch
the
king
s
body
in
king
died
of
a
tumour
in
the
back
no
one
dreaming
of
employing
the
lancet
which
would
probably
have
saved
his
life
it
is
said
that
one
king
suffered
terribly
from
an
abscess
in
the
lip
till
his
physician
called
in
a
jester
whose
pranks
made
the
king
laugh
heartily
and
so
the
abscess
burst
roman
and
sabine
priests
might
not
be
shaved
with
iron
but
only
with
bronze
razors
or
shears
and
whenever
an
iron
was
brought
into
the
sacred
grove
of
the
arval
brothers
at
rome
for
the
purpose
of
cutting
an
inscription
in
stone
an
expiatory
sacrifice
of
a
lamb
and
a
pig
must
be
offered
which
was
repeated
when
the
was
removed
from
the
grove
as
a
general
rule
iron
might
not
be
brought
into
greek
sanctuaries
in
crete
sacrifices
were
offered
to
menedemus
without
the
use
of
iron
because
the
legend
ran
that
menedemus
had
been
killed
by
an
iron
weapon
in
the
trojan
war
the
archon
of
plataea
might
not
touch
iron
but
once
a
year
at
the
annual
commemoration
of
the
men
who
fell
at
the
battle
of
plataea
he
was
allowed
to
carry
a
sword
wherewith
to
sacrifice
a
bull
to
this
day
a
hottentot
priest
never
uses
an
iron
knife
but
always
a
sharp
splint
of
quartz
in
sacrificing
an
animal
or
circumcising
a
lad
among
the
ovambo
of
africa
custom
requires
that
lads
should
be
circumcised
with
a
sharp
flint
if
none
is
to
hand
the
operation
may
be
performed
with
iron
but
the
iron
must
afterwards
be
buried
the
antandroy
and
tanala
of
madagascar
cut
the
of
their
children
with
sharp
wood
or
with
a
thread
but
never
with
an
iron
knife
in
uap

of
the
caroline

of
the

was
used
to

after

they
still
employed
them
to
slay

human

we
have
seen
that
among
the
esquimaux
of
bering
strait
the
use
of
iron
implements
is
forbidden
for
four
days
after
the
slaughter
of
a
white
whale
and
that
the
use
of
an
iron
axe
at
a
place
where
salmon
are
being
dressed
is
believed
by
these
people
to
be
a
fatal
imprudence
they
hold
a
festival
in
the
of
the
village
while
the
bladders
of
the
slain
beasts
are
hanging
there
and
during
its
celebration
no
wood
may
be
cut
with
an
iron
axe
if
it
is
necessary
to
split
firewood
this
may
be
done
with
wedges
of
bone
at
kushunuk
near
cape
vancouver
it
happened
that
nelson
and
his
party
entered
an
of
these
esquimaux
while
the
festival
of
the
bladders
was
in
progress
when
our
camping
outfit
was
brought
in
from
the
sledges
two
men
took
drums
and
as
the
clothing
and
goods
of
the
traders
who
were
with
me
were
brought
in
the
drums
were
beaten
softly
and
a
song
was
sung
in
a
low
humming
tone
but
when
our
guns
and
some
steel
traps
were
brought
in
with
other
articles
of
iron
the
drums
were
beaten
loudly
and
the
songs
raised
in
proportion
this
was
done
that
the
shades
of
the
animals
present
in
the
bladders
might
not
be
the
esquimaux
on
the
western
coast
of
hudson
bay
may
not
work
on
iron
during
the
season
for
hunting
which
falls
in
march
and
no
such
work
may
be
done
by
them
until
the
seals
have
their
pups
negroes
of
the
gold
coast
remove
all
iron
or
steel
from
their
person
when
they
consult
their
fetish
the
men
who
made
the
in
scotland
had
to
divest
themselves
of
all
metal
there
was
hardly
any
belief
we
are
told
that
had
a
stronger
hold
on
the
mind
of
a
scottish
highlander
than
that
on
no
account
whatever
should
iron
be
put
in
the
ground
on
good
friday
hence
no
grave
was
dug
and
no
field
ploughed
on
that
day
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
belief
was
based
on
that
rooted
aversion
to
iron
which
fairies
are
known
to
feel
these
touchy
beings
live
underground
and
might
resent
having
the
roof
pulled
from
over
their
heads
on
the
hallowed
day
again
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
the
of
sheep
are
employed
in
divination
being
consulted
as
to
future
marriages
births
deaths
and
funerals
but
the
forecasts
thus
made
will
not
be
accurate
unless
the
flesh
has
been
removed
from
the
bones
without
the
use
of
any
iron
in
making
the
a
kind
of
at
burghead
no
hammer
may
be
used
the
hammering
must
be
done
with
a
stone
amongst
the
jews
no
iron
tool
was
used
in
building
the
temple
at
jerusalem
or
in
making
an
altar
the
old
wooden
bridge
at
rome
which
was
considered
sacred
was
made
and
had
to
be
kept
in
repair
without
the
use
of
iron
or
bronze
it
was
expressly
provided
by
law
that
the
temple
of
jupiter
liber
at
furfo
might
be
repaired
with
iron
tools
the
council
chamber
at
cyzicus
was
constructed
of
wood
without
any
iron
nails
the
beams
being
so
arranged
that
they
could
be
taken
out
and
replaced
the
late
rajah
vijyanagram
a
member
of
the
viceroy
s
council
and
described
as
one
of
the
most
enlightened
and
estimable
of
hindoo
princes
would
not
allow
iron
to
be
used
in
the
construction
of
buildings
within
his
territory
believing
that
its
use
would
inevitably
be
followed
by
and
other
epidemics
this
superstitious
objection
to
iron
perhaps
dates
from
that
early
time
in
the
history
of
society
when
iron
was
still
a
novelty
and
as
such
was
viewed
by
many
with
suspicion
and
dislike
for
everything
new
is
apt
to
excite
the
awe
and
dread
of
the
savage
it
is
a
curious
superstition
says
a
pioneer
in
borneo
this
of
the
dusuns
to
attribute
good
or
bad
lucky
or
happens
to
them
to
something
novel
which
has
arrived
in
their
country
for
instance
my
living
in
kindram
has
caused
the
intensely
hot
weather
we
have
experienced
of
some
years
ago
a
harmless
naturalist
was
collecting
plants
among
the
high
mountains
on
the
borders
of
china
and
tibet
from
the
summit
of
a
pass
he
gazed
with
delight
down
a
long
valley
which
stretching
away
as
far
as
eye
could
reach
to
the
south
resembled
a
sea
of
bloom
for
everywhere
the
forest
was
ablaze
with
the
gorgeous
hues
of
the
rhododendron
and
azalea
in
flower
in
this
earthly
paradise
the
votary
of
science
hastened
to
install
himself
beside
a
lake
but
hardly
had
he
done
so
when
alas
the
weather
changed
though
the
season
was
early
june
the
cold
became
intense
snow
fell
heavily
and
the
bloom
of
the
rhododendrons
was
cut
off
the
inhabitants
of
a
neighbouring
village
at
once
set
down
the
unusual
severity
of
the
weather
to
the
presence
of
a
stranger
in
the
forest
and
a
signed
by
them
unanimously
was
forwarded
to
the
nearest
mandarin
setting
forth
that
the
snow
which
had
blocked
the
road
and
the
hail
which
was
blasting
their
crops
were
alike
caused
by
the
intruder
and
that
all
sorts
of
disturbances
would
follow
if
he
were
allowed
to
remain
in
these
circumstances
the
naturalist
who
had
intended
to
spend
most
of
the
summer
among
the
mountains
was
forced
to
decamp
collecting
in
this
country
he
adds
pathetically
is
not
an
easy
the
unusually
heavy
rains
which
happened
to
follow
the
english
survey
of
the
nicobar
islands
in
the
winter
of
were
imputed
by
the
alarmed
natives
to
the
wrath
of
the
spirits
at
the
theodolites
and
other
strange
instruments
which
had
been
set
up
in
so
many
of
their
favourite
haunts
and
some
of
them
proposed
to
soothe
the
anger
of
the
spirits
by
sacrificing
a
pig
when
the
german
hans
stade
was
a
captive
in
a
cannibal
tribe
of
brazilian
indians
it
happened
that
shortly
before
a
prisoner
was
to
be
eaten
a
great
wind
arose
and
blew
away
part
of
the
roofs
of
the
huts
the
savages
were
angry
with
stade
and
said
he
had
made
the
wind
to
come
by
looking
into
his
by
which
they
meant
a
book
he
had
been
reading
in
order
to
save
the
prisoner
who
was
a
friend
of
his
from
their
stomachs
so
the
pious
german
prayed
to
god
and
god
mercifully
heard
his
prayer
for
next
morning
the
weather
was
beautifully
fine
and
his
friend
was
butchered
carved
and
eaten
in
the
most
perfect
comfort
according
to
the
orotchis
of
eastern
siberia
misfortunes
have
multiplied
on
them
with
the
coming
of
europeans
they
even
go
so
far
as
to
lay
the
appearance
of
phenomena
like
thunder
at
the
door
of
the
in
the
seventeenth
century
a
succession
of
bad
seasons
excited
a
revolt
among
the
esthonian
peasantry
who
traced
the
origin
of
the
evil
to
a
which
put
a
stream
to
some
inconvenience
by
checking
its
flow
the
first
introduction
of
iron
ploughshares
into
poland
having
been
followed
by
a
succession
of
bad
harvests
the
farmers
attributed
the
badness
of
the
crops
to
the
iron
ploughshares
and
discarded
them
for
the
old
wooden
ones
to
this
day
the
primitive
baduwis
of
java
who
live
chiefly
by
husbandry
will
use
no
iron
tools
in
tilling
their
fields
the
general
dislike
of
innovation
which
always
makes
itself
strongly
felt
in
the
sphere
of
religion
is
sufficient
by
itself
to
account
for
the
superstitious
aversion
to
iron
entertained
by
kings
and
priests
and
attributed
by
them
to
the
gods
possibly
this
aversion
may
have
been
intensified
in
places
by
some
such
accidental
cause
as
the
series
of
bad
seasons
which
cast
discredit
on
iron
ploughshares
in
poland
but
the
disfavour
in
which
iron
is
held
by
the
gods
and
their
ministers
has
another
side
their
antipathy
to
the
metal
furnishes
men
with
a
weapon
which
may
be
turned
against
the
spirits
when
occasion
serves
as
their
dislike
of
iron
is
supposed
to
be
so
great
that
they
will
not
approach
persons
and
things
protected
by
the
obnoxious
metal
iron
may
obviously
be
employed
as
a
charm
for
banning
ghosts
and
other
dangerous
spirits
and
often
it
is
so
used
thus
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
the
great
safeguard
against
the
elfin
race
is
iron
or
better
yet
steel
the
metal
in
any
form
whether
as
a
sword
a
knife
a
or
what
not
is
for
this
purpose
whenever
you
enter
a
fairy
dwelling
you
should
always
remember
to
stick
a
piece
of
steel
such
as
a
knife
a
needle
or
a
in
the
door
for
then
the
elves
will
not
be
able
to
shut
the
door
till
you
come
out
again
so
too
when
you
have
shot
a
deer
and
are
bringing
it
home
at
night
be
sure
to
thrust
a
knife
into
the
carcase
for
that
keeps
the
fairies
from
laying
their
weight
on
it
a
knife
or
a
nail
in
your
pocket
is
quite
enough
to
prevent
the
fairies
from
lifting
you
up
at
night
nails
in
the
front
of
a
bed
ward
off
elves
from
women
in
the
straw
and
from
their
babes
but
to
make
quite
sure
it
is
better
to
put
the
under
the
bed
and
the
in
the
window
if
a
bull
has
fallen
over
a
rock
and
been
killed
a
nail
stuck
into
it
will
preserve
the
flesh
from
the
fairies
music
discoursed
on
that
melodious
instrument
a
jew
s
harp
keeps
the
elfin
women
away
from
the
hunter
because
the
tongue
of
the
instrument
is
of
steel
again
when
scotch
fishermen
were
at
sea
and
one
of
them
happened
to
take
the
name
of
god
in
vain
the
first
man
who
heard
him
called
out
cauld
airn
at
which
every
man
of
the
crew
grasped
the
nearest
bit
of
iron
and
held
it
between
his
hands
for
a
while
so
too
when
he
hears
the
unlucky
word
pig
mentioned
a
scotch
fisherman
will
feel
for
the
nails
in
his
boots
and
mutter
cauld

same
magic
words
are
even
whispered
in
the
churches
of
scotch
when
the
clergyman
reads
the
passage
about
the
gadarene
swine
in
morocco
iron
is
considered
a
great
protection
against
demons

it
is
usual
to
place
a
knife
or
dagger
under
a
sick
man

pillow

singhalese
believe
that
they
are
constantly
surrounded
by
evil
spirits

do

peasant
would
not
dare
to
carry
good
food
such
as
cakes
or
roast
meat
from
one
place
to
another
without
putting
an
iron
nail
on
it
to
prevent
a
demon
from
taking
possession
of
the
viands
and
so
making
the
eater
no
sick
person
whether
man
or
woman
would
venture
out
of
the
house
without
a
bunch
of
keys
or
a
knife
in
his
hand
for
without
such
a
talisman
he
would
fear
that
some
devil
might
take
advantage
of
his
weak
state
to
slip
into
his
body
and
if
a
man
has
a
large
sore
on
his
body
he
tries
to
keep
a
morsel
of

on
it
as
a
protection
against

touch
a

who
has
on
him
anything
made
of
iron
or

particularly
a

or
a
nail
of
which
the
spirit
stands
in
great
fear
nor
will
he
meddle
with

shape
to

or
which
they
may

people
attribute
cholera
to
a
goddess
who
visits
the
afflicted
family
but
they
think
that
she
may
be
kept
off
by
iron
hence
during
an
epidemic
of
cholera
people
go
about
with
axes
or
sickles
in
their
hands
their
horses
are
not
shod
otherwise
they
might
possibly
nail
to
the
door
but
their
belief
is
more
primitive
for
with
them
iron
does
not
good
luck
but
it
the
evil
spirits
so
when
a
man
has
had
an
epileptic
fit
he
will
wear
an
iron
bracelet
to
keep
away
the
evil
spirit
which
was
supposed
to
have
possessed
the
annamites
imagine
that
a
child
is
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
evil
spirits
to
protect
the
infant
from
these
malignant
beings
the
parents
sometimes
sell
the
child
to
the
village
smith
who
makes
a
small
ring
or
circlet
of

and
puts

chain
the

have

power
over
him
after

has

and
the
danger
is
over
the
parents
ask
the
smith
to
break
the
iron
ring
and
thank
him
for
his
services
no
metal
but
iron
will
serve
the
purpose
on
the
slave
coast
of
africa
when
a
mother
sees
her
child
gradually
wasting
away
she
concludes
that
a
demon
has
entered
into
the
child
and
takes
her
measures
accordingly
to
lure
the
demon
out
of
the
body
of
her
offspring
she
offers
a
sacrifice
of
food
and
while
the
devil
is
bolting
it
she
attaches
iron
rings
and
small
bells
to
her
child
s
ankles
and
hangs
iron
chains
round
his
neck
the
jingling
of
the
iron
and
the
tinkling
of
the
bells
are
supposed
to
prevent
the
demon
when
he
has
concluded
his
repast
from
entering
again
into
the
body
of
the
little
sufferer
hence
many
children
may

part
of
africa
weighed
down
with
iron
ornaments
the
use
of
iron
as
a
means
to
exorcise
demons
was
forbidden
by
the
coptic
church
in
india
the
mourner
who
performs
the
ceremony
of
putting
fire
into
the
dead
person
s
mouth
carries
with
him
a
piece
of
iron
it
may
be
a
key
or
a
knife
or
a
simple
piece
of
iron
and
during
the
whole
time
of
his
separation
for
he
is
unclean
for
a
certain
time
and
no
one
will
either
touch
him
or
eat
or
drink
with
him
neither
can
he
change
his
clothes
he
carries
the
piece
of
iron
about
with
him
to
keep
off
the
evil
spirit
in
calcutta
the
bengali
clerks
in
the
government
offices
used
to
wear
a
small
key
on
one
of
their
fingers
when
they
had
been
chief
when
a
woman
dies
in
childbed
in
the
island
of
salsette
they
put
a
nail
or
other
piece
of
iron
in
the
folds
of
her
dress
this
is
done
especially
if
the
child
survives
her
the
intention
plainly
is
to
prevent
her
spirit
from
coming
back
for
they
believe
that
a
dead
mother
haunts
the
house
and
seeks
to
carry
away
her
child
in
the
of
scotland
immediately
after
a
death
had
taken
place
a
piece

as
a

or
a
used
to
be
stuck
into
all
the
meal
butter
cheese
flesh
and
whisky
in
the
house
to
prevent
death
from
entering
the
neglect
of
this
salutary
precaution
is
said
to
have
been
closely
followed
by
the
corruption
of
the
food
and
drink
the
whisky
has
been
known
to
become
as
white
as
milk
when
iron
is
used
as
a
protective
charm
after
a
death
as
in
these
hindoo
and
scotch
customs
the
spirit
against
which
it
is
directed
is
the
ghost
of
the
deceased
sharp
weapons
tabooed
there
is
a
priestly
king
to
the
north
of
zengwih
in
burma
revered
by
the
sotih
as
the
highest
spiritual
and
temporal
authority
into
whose
house
no
weapon
or
cutting
instrument
may
be
brought
this
rule
may
perhaps
be
explained
by
a
custom
observed
by
various
peoples
after
a
death
they
refrain
from
the
use
of
sharp
instruments
so
long
as
the
ghost
of
the
deceased
is
supposed
to
be
near
lest
they
should
wound
it
thus
among
the
esquimaux
of
bering
strait
during
the
day
on
which
a
person
dies
in
the
village
no
one
is
permitted
to
work
and
the
relatives
must
perform
no
labour
during
the
three
following
days
it
is
especially
forbidden
during
this
period
to
cut
with
any
edged
instrument
such
as
a
knife
or
an
axe
and
the
use
of
pointed
instruments
like
needles
or
bodkins
is
also
forbidden
this
is
said
to
be
done
to
avoid
cutting
or
injuring
the
shade
which
may
be
present
at
any
time
during
this
period
and
if
accidentally
injured
by
any
of
these
things
it
would
become
very
angry
and
bring
sickness
or
death
to
the
people
the
relatives
must
also
be
very
careful
at
this
time
not
to
make
any
loud
or
harsh
noises
that
may
startle
or
anger
the
we
have
seen
that
in
like
manner
after
killing
a
white
whale
these
esquimaux
abstain
from
the
use
of
cutting
or
pointed
instruments
for
four
days
lest
they
should
unwittingly
cut
or
stab
the
whale
s
ghost
the
same
taboo
is
sometimes
observed
by
them
when
there
is
a
sick
person
in
the
village
probably
from
a
fear
of
injuring
his
shade
which
may
be
hovering
outside
of
his
body
after
a
death
the
roumanians
of
transylvania
are
careful
not
to
leave
a
knife
lying
with
the
sharp
edge
uppermost
as
long
as
the
corpse
remains
in
the
house
or
else
the
soul
will
be
forced
to
ride
on
the
for
seven
days
after
a
death
the
corpse
being
still
in
the
house
the
chinese
abstain
from
the
use
of
knives
and
needles
and
even
of
chopsticks
eating
their
food
with
their
fingers
on
the
third
sixth
ninth
and
fortieth
days
after
the
funeral
the
old
prussians
and
lithuanians
used
to
prepare
a
meal
to
which
standing
at
the
door
they
invited
the
soul
of
the
deceased
at
these
meals
they
sat
silent
round
the
table
and
used
no
knives
and
the
women
who
served
up
the
food
were
also
without
knives
if
any
morsels
fell
from
the
table
they
were
left
lying
there
for
the
lonely
souls
that
had
no
living
relations
or
friends
to
feed
them
when
the
meal
was
over
the
priest
took
a
broom
and
swept
the
souls
out
of
the
house
saying
dear
souls
ye
have
eaten
and
drunk
go
forth
go
in
cutting
the
nails
and
combing
the
hair
of
a
dead
prince
in
south
celebes
only
the
back
of
the
knife
and
of
the
comb
may
be
used
the
germans
say
that
a
knife
should
not
be
left
edge
upwards
because
god
and
the
spirits
dwell
there
or
because
it
will
cut
the
face
of
god
and
the
angels
among
the
monumbos
of
new
guinea
a
pregnant
woman
may
not
use
sharp
instruments
for
example
she
may
not
sew
if
she
used
such
instruments
they
think
that
she
would
thereby
stab
the
child
in
her
womb
among
the
kayans
of
borneo
when
the
begin
all
men
leave
the
room
and
all
cutting
weapons
and
iron
are
also
removed
perhaps
in
order
not
to
frighten
the
child
says
the
writer
who
reports
the
custom
the
reason
may
rather
be
a
fear
of
injuring
the
flitting
soul
of
mother
or
babe
in
uganda
when
the
hour
of
a
woman
s
delivery
is
at
hand
her
husband
carries
all
spears
and
weapons
out
of
the
house
doubtless
in
order
that
they
may
not
hurt
the
tender
soul
of
the
child
early
in
the
period
of
the
ming
dynasty
a
professor
of
geomancy
made
the
alarming
discovery
that
the
spiritual
atmosphere
of
a
city
near
nanking
was
in
a
truly
deplorable
condition
through
the
intrusion
of
an
evil
spirit
the
chinese
emperor
with
paternal
solicitude
directed
that
the
north
gate
by
which
the
devil
had
effected
his
entrance
should
be
built
up
solid
and
that
for
the
future
the
population
of
the
city
should
devote
their
energies
to
the
pursuits
of
and
the
shaving
of
because
as
he
sagaciously
perceived
all
these
professions
call
for
the
use
of
instruments
which
could
not
fail
to
keep
the
demon
at
bay
we
can
now
understand
why
no
cutting
instrument
may
be
taken
into
the
house
of
the
burmese
pontiff
like
so
many
priestly
kings
he
is
probably
regarded
as
divine
and
it
is
therefore
right
that
his
sacred
spirit
should
not
be
exposed
to
the
risk
of
being
cut
or
wounded
whenever
it
quits
his
body
to
hover
invisible
in
the
air
or
to
fly
on
some
distant
mission
blood
tabooed
we
have
seen
that
the
flamen
dialis
was
forbidden
to
touch
or
even
name
raw
flesh
at
certain
times
a
brahman
teacher
is
enjoined
not
to
look
on
raw
flesh
blood
or
persons
whose
hands
have
been
cut
off
in
uganda
the
father
of
twins
is
in
a
state
of
taboo
for
some
time
after
the
birth
among
other
rules
he
is
forbidden
to
kill
anything
or
to
see
blood
in
the
pelew
islands
when
a
raid
has
been
made
on
a
village
and
a
head
carried
off
the
relations
of
the
slain
man
are
tabooed
and
have
to
submit
to
certain
observances
in
order
to
escape
the
wrath
of
his
ghost
they
are
shut
up
in
the
house
touch
no
raw
flesh
and
chew
betel
over
which
an
incantation
has
been
uttered
by
the
exorcist
after
this
the
ghost
of
the
slaughtered
man
goes
away
to
the
enemy
s
country
in
pursuit
of
his
murderer
the
taboo
is
probably
based
on
the
common
belief
that
the
soul
or
spirit
of
the
animal
is
in
the
blood
as
tabooed
persons
are
believed
to
be
in
a
perilous
example
the
relations
of
the
slain
man
are
liable
to
the
attacks
of
his
indignant
is
especially
necessary
to
isolate
them
from
contact
with
spirits
hence
the
prohibition
to
touch
raw
meat
but
as
usual
the
taboo
is
only
the
special
enforcement
of
a
general
precept
in
other
words
its
observance
is
particularly
enjoined
in
circumstances
which
seem
urgently
to
call
for
its
application
but
apart
from
such
circumstances
the
prohibition
is
also
observed
though
less
strictly
as
a
common
rule
of
life
thus
some
of
the
esthonians
will
not
taste
blood
because
they
believe
that
it
contains
the
animal
s
soul
which
would
enter
the
body
of
the
person
who
tasted
the
blood
some
indian
tribes
of
north
america
through
a
strong
principle
of
religion
abstain
in
the
strictest
manner
from
eating
the
blood
of
any
animal
as
it
contains
the
life
and
spirit
of
the
these
indians
commonly
pull
their
venison
before
they
dress
it
several
times
through
the
smoke
and
flame
of
the
fire
both
by
the
way
of
a
sacrifice
and
to
consume
the
blood
life
or
animal
spirits
of
the
beast
which
with
them
would
be
a
most
horrid
abomination
to
among
the
western
dénés
or
tinneh
indians
of
british
columbia
until
lately
no
woman
would
partake
of
blood
and
both
men
and
women
abhorred
the
flesh
of
a
beaver
which
had
been
caught
and
died
in
a
trap
and
of
a
bear
strangled
to
death
in
a
snare
because
the
blood
remained
in
the
many
of
the
slave
hare
and
dogrib
indians
scruple
to
taste
the
blood
of
game
hunters
of
the
former
tribes
collect
the
blood
in
the
animal
s
paunch
and
bury
it
in
the
snow
the
malepa
a
bantu
tribe
in
the
north
of
the
transvaal
will
taste
no
blood
hence
they
cut
the
throats
of
the
cattle
they
slaughter
and
let
the
blood
drain
out
of
the
carcase
before
they
will
eat
it
and
they
do
the
same
with
game
jewish
hunters
poured
out
the
blood
of
the
game
they
had
killed
and
covered
it
up
with
dust
they
would
not
taste
the
blood
believing
that
the
soul
or
life
of
the
animal
was
in
the
blood
or
actually
was
the
blood
the
same
belief
was
held
by
the
romans
and
is
shared
by
the
arabs
by
chinese
medical
writers
and
by
some
of
the
papuan
tribes
of
new
guinea
it
is
a
common
rule
that
royal
blood
may
not
be
shed
upon
the
ground
hence
when
a
king
or
one
of
his
family
is
to
be
put
to
death
a
mode
of
execution
is
devised
by
which
the
royal
blood
shall
not
be
spilt
upon
the
earth
about
the
year
the
generalissimo
of
the
army
rebelled
against
the
king
of
siam
and
put
him
to
death
after
the
manner
of
royal
criminals
or
as
princes
of
the
blood
are
treated
when
convicted
of
capital
crimes
which
is
by
putting
them
into
a
large
iron
caldron
and
pounding
them
to
pieces
with
wooden
pestles
because
none
of
their
royal
blood
must
be
spilt
on
the
ground
it
being
by
their
religion
thought
great
impiety
to
contaminate
the
divine
blood
by
mixing
it
with
other
siamese
modes
of
executing
a
royal
person
are
starvation
suffocation
stretching
him
on
a
scarlet
cloth
and
thrusting
a
billet
of
fragrant
into
his
stomach
or
lastly
sewing
him
up
in
a
leather
sack
with
a
large
stone
and
throwing
him
into
the
river
sometimes
the
sufferer
s
neck
is
broken
with
clubs
before
he
is
thrown
into
the
water
when
kublai
khan
defeated
and
took
his
uncle
nayan
who
had
rebelled
against
him
he
caused
nayan
to
be
put
to
death
by
being
wrapt
in
a
carpet
and
tossed
to
and
fro
till
he
died
because
he
would
not
have
the
blood
of
his
line
imperial
spilt
upon
the
ground
or
exposed
in
the
eye
of
heaven
and
before
the
friar
ricold
mentions
the
tartar
maxim
one
khan
will
put
another
to
death
to
get
possession
of
the
throne
but
he
takes
great
care
that
the
blood
be
not
spilt
for
they
say
that
it
is
highly
improper
that
the
blood
of
the
great
khan
should
be
spilt
upon
the
ground
so
they
cause
the
victim
to
be
smothered
somehow
or
the
like
feeling
prevails
at
the
court
of
burma
where
a
peculiar
mode
of
execution
without
bloodshed
is
reserved
for
princes
of
the
another
writer
on
burma
observes
that
according
to
mongolian
tradition
it
is
considered
improper
to
spill
the
blood
of
any
member
of
the
royal
race
princes
of
the
blood
are
executed
by
a
blow
or
blows
of
a
bludgeon
inflicted
on
the
back
of
the
neck
the
corpse
is
placed
in
a
red
velvet
sack
which
is
fixed
between
two
large
perforated
jars
and
then
sunk
in
the
river
irawadi
princesses
are
executed
in
a
similar
manner
with
the
exception
that
they
are
put
to
death
by
a
blow
in
front
instead
of
the
back

relations
of

king
of
burma
were
despatched
by
being
beaten
across
the
throat
with
a
bamboo
in
tonquin
the
ordinary
mode
of
execution
is
beheading
but
persons
of
the
blood
royal
are
strangled
in
ashantee
the
blood
of
none
of
the
royal
family
may
be
shed
if
one
of
them
is
guilty
of
a
great
crime
he
is
drowned
in
the
river
dah
as
the
blood
royal
of
dahomey
may
not
be
spilled
offenders
of
the
royal
family
are
drowned
or
strangled
commonly
they
are
bound
hand
and
foot
carried
out
to
sea
in
a
canoe
and
thrown
overboard
when
a
king
of
benin
came
to
the
throne
he
used
to
put
his
brothers
to
death
but
as
no
one
might
lay
hands
on
a
prince
of
the
blood
the
king
commanded
his
brothers
to
hang
themselves
after
which
he
buried
their
bodies
with
great
pomp
in
madagascar
the
blood
of
nobles
might
not
be
shed
hence
when
four
christians
of
that
class
were
to
be
executed
they
were
burned
alive
in
uganda
no
one
may
shed
royal
blood
on
any
account
not
even
when
ordered
by
the
king
to
slay
one
of
the
royal
house
royalty
may
only
be
starved
or
burned
to
formerly
when
a
young
king
of
uganda
came
of
age
all
his
brothers
were
burnt
except
two
or
three
who
were
preserved
to
keep
up
the
succession
or
a
space
of
ground
having
been
fenced
in
with
a
high
paling
and
a
deep
ditch
the
doomed
men
were
led
into
the
enclosure
and
left
there
till
they
died
while
guards
kept
watch
outside
to
prevent
their
escape
among
the
bawenda
of
southern
africa
dangerous
princes
are
strangled
for
their
blood
may
not
be
shed
the
reluctance
to
spill
royal
blood
seems
to
be
only
a
particular
case
of
a
general
unwillingness
to
shed
blood
or
at
least
to
allow
it
to
fall
on
the
ground
marco
polo
tells
us
that
in
his
day
persons
caught
in
the
streets
of
cambaluc
peking
at
unseasonable
hours
were
arrested
and
if
found
guilty
of
a
misdemeanour
were
beaten
with
a
stick
under
this
punishment
people
sometimes
die
but
they
adopt
it
in
order
to
eschew
bloodshed
for
their
say
that
it
is
an
evil
thing
to
shed
man
s
when
captain
christian
was
shot
by
the
manx
government
at
the
restoration
in
the
spot
on
which
he
stood
was
covered
with
white
blankets
that
his
blood
might
not
fall
on
the
ground
in
west
sussex
people
believe
that
the
ground
on
which
human
blood
has
been
shed
is
accursed
and
will
remain
barren
for
ever
among
some
primitive
peoples
when
the
blood
of
a
tribesman
has
to
be
spilt
it
is
not
suffered
to
fall
upon
the
ground
but
is
received
upon
the
bodies
of
his
thus
in
some
australian
tribes
boys
who
are
being
circumcised
are
laid
on
a
platform
formed
by
the
living
bodies
of
the
tribesmen
and
when
a
boy
s
tooth
is
knocked
out
as
an
initiatory
ceremony
he
is
seated
on
the
shoulders
of
a
man
on
whose
breast
the
blood
flows
and
may
not
be
wiped
away
when
australian
blacks
bleed
each
other
as
a
cure
for
headache
and
other
ailments
they
are
very
careful
not
to
spill
any
of
the
blood
on
the
ground
but
sprinkle
it
on
each
other
we
have
already
seen
that
in
the
australian
ceremony
for
making
rain
the
blood
which
is
supposed
to
imitate
the
rain
is
received
upon
the
bodies
of
the
tribesmen
also
the
gauls
used
to
drink
their
enemies
blood
and
paint
themselves
therewith
so
also
they
write
that
the
old
irish
were
wont
and
so
have
i
seen
some
of
the
irish
do
but
not
their
enemies
but
friends
blood
as
namely
at
the
execution
of
a
notable
traitor
at
limerick
called
murrogh
o
brien
i
saw
an
old
woman
which
was
his
take
up
his
head
whilst
he
was
quartered
and
suck
up
all
the
blood
that
ran
thereout
saying
that
the
earth
was
not
worthy
to
drink
it
and
therewith
also
steeped
her
face
and
breast
and
tore
her
hair
crying
out
and
shrieking
most
after
a
battle
in
horne
island
south
pacific
it
was
found
that
the
brother
of
the
vanquished
king
was
among
the
wounded
it
was
sad
to
see
his
wife
collect
in
her
hands
the
blood
which

from
his
wounds
and
throw
it
on
to
her
head
while
she
uttered
piercing
cries
all
the
relatives
of
the
wounded
collected
in
the
same
manner
the
blood
which
had
flowed
from
them
down
even
to
the
last
drop
and
they
even
applied
their
lips
to
the
leaves
of
the
shrubs
and
licked
it
all
up
to
the
last
in
the
marquesas
islands
the
persons
who
helped
a
woman
at
childbirth
received
on
their
heads
the
blood
which
flowed
at
the
cutting
of
the
for
the
blood
might
not
touch
anything
but
a
sacred
object
and
in
polynesia
the
head
is
sacred
in
a
high
degree
in
south
celebes
at
childbirth
a
female
slave
stands
under
the
house
the
houses
being
raised
on
posts
above
the
ground
and
receives
in
a
basin
on
her
head
the
blood
which
trickles
through
the
bamboo
floor
among
the
latuka
of
central
africa
the
earth
on
which
a
drop
of
blood
has
fallen
at
childbirth
is
carefully
scraped
up
with
an
iron
shovel
put
into
a
pot
along
with
the
water
used
in
washing
the
mother
and
buried
tolerably
deep
outside
the
house
on
the
side
in
west
africa
if
a
drop
of
your
blood
has
fallen
on
the
ground
you
must
carefully
cover
it
up
rub
and
stamp
it
into
the
soil
if
it
has
fallen
on
the
side
of
a
canoe
or
a
tree
the
place
is
cut
out
and
the
chip
destroyed
the
caffres
we
are
told
have
a
great
horror
of
blood
and
must
purify
themselves
from
the
pollution
if
they
have
shed
it
and
been
bespattered
by
it
hence
warriors
on
the
return
from
battle
purge
themselves
with
emetics
and
that
so
violently
that
some
of
them
give
up
the
ghost
a
caffre
would
never
allow
even
a
drop
of
blood
from
his
nose
or
a
wound
to
lie
uncovered
but
huddles
it
over
with
earth
that
his
feet
may
not
be
defiled
by
it
one
motive
of
these
african
customs
may
be
a
wish
to
prevent
the
blood
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
magicians
who
might
make
an
evil
use
of
it
that
is
admittedly
the
reason
why
people
in
west
africa
stamp
out
any
blood
of
theirs
which
has
fallen
on
the
ground
or
cut
out
any
wood
that
has
been
soaked
with
it
from
a
like
dread
of
sorcery
natives
of
new
guinea
are
careful
to
burn
any
sticks
leaves
or
rags
which
are
stained
with
their
blood
and
if
the
blood
has
dripped
on
the
ground
they
turn
up
the
soil
and
if
possible
light
a
fire
on
the
spot
the
same
fear
explains
the
curious
duties
discharged
by
a
class
of
men
called
or
blue
blood
among
the
betsileo
of
madagascar
it
is
their
business
to
eat
all
the
and
to
lick
up
all
the
spilt
blood
of
the
nobles
when
the
nobles
pare
their
nails
the
parings
are
collected
to
the
last
scrap
and
swallowed
by
these
if
the
parings
are
too
large
they
are
minced
small
and
so
gulped
down
again
should
a
nobleman
wound
himself
say
in
cutting
his
nails
or
treading
on
something
the
lick
it
up
as
fast
as
possible
nobles
of
high
rank
hardly
go
anywhere
without
these
humble
attendants
but
if
it
should
happen
that
there
are
none
of
them
present
the
cut
nails
and
the
spilt
blood
are
carefully
collected
to
be
afterwards
swallowed
by
the
there
is
scarcely
a
nobleman
of
any
pretensions
who
does
not
strictly
observe
this
custom
the
intention
of
which
probably
is
to
prevent
these
parts
of
his
person
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
sorcerers
who
on
the
principles
of
contagious
magic
could
work
him
harm
thereby
the
tribes
of
the
white
nile
are
said
never
to
shed
human
blood
in
their
villages
because
they
think
the
sight
of
it
would
render
women
barren
or
bring
misfortune
on
their
children
hence
executions
and
murders
commonly
take
place
on
the
roads
or
in
the
forest
the
unwillingness
to
shed
blood
is
extended
by
some
peoples
to
the
blood
of
animals
thus
when
the
caffres
offer
an
ox
to
the
spirits
the
blood
of
the
beast
must
be
carefully
caught
in
a
calabash
and
none
of
it
may
fall
on
the
ground
when
the
wanika
in
eastern
africa
kill
their
cattle
for
food
they
either
stone
or
beat
the
animal
to
death
so
as
not
to
shed
the
amongst
the
damaras
cattle
killed
for
food
are
suffocated
but
when
sacrificed
they
are
speared
to
death
but
like
most
pastoral
tribes
in
africa
both
the
wanika
and
damaras
very
seldom
kill
their
cattle
which
are
indeed
commonly
invested
with
a
kind
of
sanctity
some
of
the
negroes
of
togoland
in
west
africa
celebrate
a
festival
in
honour
of
the
earth
at
which
it
is
unlawful
to
shed
blood
on
the
ground
hence
the
fowls
which
are
sacrificed
on
these
occasions
have
their
necks
wrung
not
their
throats
cut
in
killing
an
animal
for
food
the
easter
islanders
do
not
shed
its
blood
but
stun
it
or
suffocate
it
in
smoke
when
the
natives
of
san
cristoval
one
of
the
solomon
islands
sacrifice
a
pig
to
a
ghost
in
a
sacred
place
they
take
great
care
that
the
blood
shall
not
fall
on
the
ground
so
they
place
the
animal
in
a
large
bowl
and
cut
it
up
there
it
is
said
that
in
ancient
india
the
sacrificial
victims
were
not
slaughtered
but
strangled
the
general
explanation
of
the
reluctance
to
shed
blood
on
the
ground
is
probably
to
be
found
in
the
belief
that
the
soul
is
in
the
blood
and
that
therefore
any
ground
on
which
it
may
fall
necessarily
becomes
taboo
or
sacred
in
new
zealand
anything
upon
which
even
a
drop
of
a
high
chief
s
blood
chances
to
fall
becomes
taboo
or
sacred
to
him
for
instance
a
party
of
natives
having
come
to
visit
a
chief
in
a
fine
new
canoe
the
chief
got
into
it
but
in
doing
so
a
splinter
entered
his
foot
and
the
blood
trickled
on
the
canoe
which
at
once
became
sacred
to
him
the
owner
jumped
out
dragged
the
canoe
ashore
opposite
the
chief
s
house
and
left
it
there
again
a
chief
in
entering
a
missionary
s
house
knocked
his
head
against
a
beam
and
the
blood
flowed
the
natives
said
that
in
former
times
the
house
would
have
belonged
to
the
chief
as
usually
happens
with
taboos
of
universal
application
the
prohibition
to
spill
the
blood
of
a
tribesman
on
the
ground
applies
with
peculiar
stringency
to
chiefs
and
kings
and
is
observed
in
their
case
long
after
it
has
ceased
to
be
observed
in
the
case
of
others
we
have
seen
that
the
flamen
dialis
was
not
allowed
to
walk
under
a
trellised
vine
the
reason
for
this
prohibition
was
perhaps
as
follows
it
has
been
shewn
that
plants
are
considered
as
animate
beings
which
bleed
when
cut
the
red
juice
which
exudes
from
some
of
them
being
regarded
as
the
blood
of
the
plant
the
juice
of
the
grape
is
therefore
naturally
conceived
as
the
blood
of
the
vine
and
since
as
we
have
just
seen
the
soul
is
often
believed
to
be
in
the
blood
the
juice
of
the
grape
is
regarded
as
the
soul
or
as
containing
the
soul
of
the
vine
this
belief
is
strengthened
by
the
intoxicating
effects
of
wine
for
according
to
primitive
notions
all
abnormal
mental
states
such
as
intoxication
or
madness
are
caused
by
the
entrance
of
a
spirit
into
the
person
such
mental
states
in
other
words
are
accounted
forms
of
possession
or
inspiration
wine
therefore
is
considered
on
two
distinct
grounds
as
a
spirit
or
containing
a
spirit
first
because
as
a
red
juice
it
is
identified
with
the
blood
of
the
plant
and
second
because
it
intoxicates
or
inspires
therefore
if
the
flamen
dialis
had
walked
under
a
trellised
vine
the
spirit
of
the
vine
embodied
in
the
clusters
of
grapes
would
have
been
immediately
over
his
head
and
might
have
touched
it
which
for
a
person
like
him
in
a
state
of
permanent
taboo
would
have
been
highly
dangerous
this
interpretation
of
the
prohibition
will
be
made
probable
if
we
can
shew
first
that
wine
has
been
actually
viewed
by
some
peoples
as
blood
and
intoxication
as
inspiration
produced
by
drinking
the
blood
and
second
that
it
is
often
considered
dangerous
especially
for
tabooed
persons
to
have
either
blood
or
a
living
person
over
their
heads
with
regard
to
the
first
point
we
are
informed
by
plutarch
that
of
old
the
egyptian
kings
neither
drank
wine
nor
offered
it
in
libations
to
the
gods
because
they
held
it
to
be
the
blood
of
beings
who
had
once
fought
against
the
gods
the
vine
having
sprung
from
their
rotting
bodies
and
the
frenzy
of
intoxication
was
explained
by
the
supposition
that
the
drunken
man
was
filled
with
the
blood
of
the
enemies
of
the
gods
the
aztecs
regarded
or
the
wine
of
the
country
as
bad
on
account
of
the
wild
deeds
which
men
did
under
its
influence
but
these
wild
deeds
were
believed
to
be
the
acts
not
of
the
drunken
man
but
of
the
by
whom
he
was
possessed
and
inspired
and
so
seriously
was
this
theory
of
inspiration
held
that
if
any
one
spoke
ill
of
or
insulted
a
tipsy
man
he
was
liable
to
be
punished
for
disrespect
to
the
incarnate
in
his
votary
hence
says
sahagun
it
was
believed
not
without
ground
that
the
indians
intoxicated
themselves
on
purpose
to
commit
with
impunity
crimes
for
which
they
would
certainly
have
been
punished
if
they
had
committed
them
sober
thus
it
appears
that
on
the
primitive
view
intoxication
or
the
inspiration
produced
by
wine
is
exactly
parallel
to
the
inspiration
produced
by
drinking
the
blood
of
animals
the
soul
or
life
is
in
the
blood
and
wine
is
the
blood
of
the
vine
hence
whoever
drinks
the
blood
of
an
animal
is
inspired
with
the
soul
of
the
animal
or
of
the
god
who
as
we
have
seen
is
often
supposed
to
enter
into
the
animal
before
it
is
slain
and
whoever
drinks
wine
drinks
the
blood
and
so
receives
into
himself
the
soul
or
spirit
of
the
god
of
the
vine
with
regard
to
the
second
point
the
fear
of
passing
under
blood
or
under
a
living
person
we
are
told
that
some
of
the
australian
blacks
have
a
dread
of
passing
under
a
leaning
tree
or
even
under
the
rails
of
a
fence
the
reason
they
give
is
that
a
woman
may
have
been
upon
the
tree
or
fence
and
some
blood
from
her
may
have
fallen
on
it
and
might
fall
from
it
on
them
in
ugi
one
of
the
solomon
islands
a
man
will
never
if
he
can
help
it
pass
under
a
tree
which
has
fallen
across
the
path
for
the
reason
that
a
woman
may
have
stepped
over
it
before
him
amongst
the
karens
of
burma
going
under
a
house
especially
if
there
are
females
within
is
avoided
as
is
also
the
passing
under
trees
of
which
the
branches
extend
downwards
in
a
particular
direction
and
the
of
fallen
trees
the
siamese
think
it
unlucky
to
pass
under
a
rope
on
which
women
s
clothes
are
hung
and
to
avert
evil
consequences
the
person
who
has
done
so
must
build
a
chapel
to
the
probably
in
all
such
cases
the
rule
is
based
on
a
fear
of
being
brought
into
contact
with
blood
especially
the
blood
of
women
from
a
like
fear
a
maori
will
never
lean
his
back
against
the
wall
of
a
native
house
for
the
blood
of
women
is
supposed
to
have
disastrous
effects
upon
males
the
arunta
of
central
australia
believe
that
a
draught
of
woman
s
blood
would
kill
the
strongest
man
in
the
encounter
bay
tribe
of
south
australia
boys
are
warned
that
if
they
see
the
blood
of
women
they
will
early
become
and
their
strength
will
fail
prematurely
men
of
the
booandik
tribe
in
south
australia
think
that
if
they
see
the
blood
of
their
women
they
will
not
be
able
to
fight
against
their
enemies
and
will
be
killed
if
the
sun
dazzles
their
eyes
at
a
fight
the
first
woman
they
afterwards
meet
is
sure
to
get
a
blow
from
their
club
in
the
island
of
wetar
it
is
thought
that
if
a
man
or
a
lad
comes
upon
a
woman
s
blood
he
will
be
unfortunate
in
war
and
other
undertakings
and
that
any
precautions
he
may
take
to
avoid
the
misfortune
will
be
vain
the
people
of
ceram
also
believe
that
men
who
see
women
s
blood
will
be
wounded
in
battle
it
is
an
esthonian
belief
that
men
who
see
women
s
blood
will
suffer
from
an
eruption
on
the
skin
a
fan
negro
told
miss
kingsley
that
a
young
man
in
his
village
who
was
so
weak
that
he
could
hardly
crawl
about
had
fallen
into
this
state
through
seeing
the
blood
of
a
woman
who
had
been
killed
by
a
falling
tree
the
underlying
idea
regarding
blood
is
of
course
the
old
one
that
the
blood
is
the
life
the
life
in
africa
means
a
spirit
hence
the
liberated
blood
is
the
liberated
spirit
and
liberated
spirits
are
always
whipping
into
people
who
do
not
want
them
in
the
case
of
the
young
fan
the
opinion
held
was
that
the
weak
spirit
of
the
woman
had
got
into
the
head
tabooed
again
the
reason
for
not
passing
under
dangerous
objects
like
a
vine
or
women
s
blood
is
a
fear
that
they
may
come
in
contact
with
the
head
for
among
many
peoples
the
head
is
peculiarly
sacred
the
special
sanctity
attributed
to
it
is
sometimes
explained
by
a
belief
that
it
is
the
seat
of
a
spirit
which
is
very
sensitive
to
injury
or
disrespect
thus
the
yorubas
of
the
slave
coast
hold
that
every
man
has
three
spiritual
inmates
of
whom
the
first
called
olori
dwells
in
the
head
and
is
the
man
s
protector
guardian
and
guide
offerings
are
made
to
this
spirit
chiefly
of
fowls
and
some
of
the
blood
mixed
with
is
rubbed
on
the
forehead
the
karens
of
burma
suppose
that
a
being
called
the
resides
in
the
upper
part
of
the
head
and
while
it
retains
its
seat
no
harm
can
befall
the
person
from
the
efforts
of
the
seven
or
personified
passions
but
if
the
becomes
heedless
or
weak
certain
evil
to
the
person
is
the
result
hence
the
head
is
carefully
attended
to
and
all
possible
pains
are
taken
to
provide
such
dress
and
attire
as
will
be
pleasing
to
the
the
siamese
think
that
a
spirit
called
or
dwells
in
the
human
head
of
which
it
is
the
guardian
spirit
the
spirit
must
be
carefully
protected
from
injury
of
every
kind
hence
the
act
of
shaving
or
cutting
the
hair
is
accompanied
with
many
ceremonies
the
is
very
sensitive
on
points
of
honour
and
would
feel
mortally
insulted
if
the
head
in
which
he
resides
were
touched
by
the
hand
of
a
stranger
when
bastian
in
conversation
with
a
brother
of
the
king
of
siam
raised
his
hand
to
touch
the
prince
s
skull
in
order
to
illustrate
some
medical
remarks
he
was
making
a
sullen
and
threatening
murmur
bursting
from
the
lips
of
the
crouching
courtiers
warned
him
of
the
breach
of
etiquette
he
had
committed
for
in
siam
there
is
no
greater
insult
to
a
man
of
rank
than
to
touch
his
head
if
a
siamese
touch
the
head
of
another
with
his
foot
both
of
them
must
build
chapels
to
the
to
avert
the
omen
nor
does
the
guardian
spirit
of
the
head
like
to
have
the
hair
washed
too
often
it
might
injure
or
incommode
him
it
was
a
grand
solemnity
when
the
king
of
burma
s
head
was
washed
with
water
drawn
from
the
middle
of
the
river
whenever
the
native
professor
from
whom
bastian
took
lessons
in
burmese
at
mandalay
had
his
head
washed
which
took
place
as
a
rule
once
a
month
he
was
generally
absent
for
three
days
together
that
time
being
consumed
in
preparing
for
and
recovering
from
the
operation
of
bastian
s
custom
of
washing
his
head
daily
gave
rise
to
much
remark
the
head
of
the
king
of
persia
was
cleaned
only
once
a
year
on
his
birthday
roman
women
washed
their
heads
annually
on
the
thirteenth
of
august
diana
s
day
the
indians
of
peru
fancied
they
could
rid
themselves
of
their
sins
by
scrubbing
their
heads
with
a
small
stone
and
then
washing
them
in
a
stream
again
the
burmese
think
it
an
indignity
to
have
any
one
especially
a
woman
over
their
heads
and
for
this
reason
burmese
houses
have
never
more
than
one
story
the
houses
are
raised
on
posts
above
the
ground
and
whenever
anything
fell
through
the
floor
bastian
had
always
difficulty
in
persuading
a
servant
to
fetch
it
from
under
the
house
in
rangoon
a
priest
summoned
to
the
bedside
of
a
sick
man
climbed
up
a
ladder
and
got
in
at
the
window
rather
than
ascend
the
staircase
to
reach
which
he
must
have
passed
under
a
gallery
a
pious
burman
of
rangoon
finding
some
images
of
buddha
in
a
ship
s
cabin
offered
a
high
price
for
them
that
they
might
not
be
degraded
by
sailors
walking
over
them
on
the
deck
formerly
in
siam
no
person
might
cross
a
bridge
while
his
superior
in
rank
was
passing
underneath
nor
might
he
walk
in
a
room
above
one
in
which
his
superior
was
sitting
or
lying
the
cambodians
esteem
it
a
grave
offence
to
touch
a
man
s
head
some
of
them
will
not
enter
a
place
where
anything
whatever
is
suspended
over
their
heads
and
the
meanest
cambodian
would
never
consent
to
live
under
an
inhabited
room
hence
the
houses
are
built
of
one
story
only
and
even
the
government
respects
the
prejudice
by
never
placing
a
prisoner
in
the
stocks
under
the
floor
of
a
house
though
the
houses
are
raised
high
above
the
ground
the
same
superstition
exists
amongst
the
malays
for
an
early
traveller
reports
that
in
java
people
wear
nothing
on
their
heads
and
say
that
nothing
must
be
on
their
heads
and
if
any
person
were
to
put
his
hand
upon
their
head
they
would
kill
him
and
they
do
not
build
houses
with
storeys
in
order
that
they
may
not
walk
over
each
other
s
in
uganda
no
person
belonging
to
the
king
s
totem
clan
was
allowed
to
get
on
the
top
of
the
palace
to
roof
it
for
that
would
have
been
regarded
as
equivalent
to
getting
on
the
top
of
the
king
hence
the
palace
had
to
be
roofed
by
men
of
a
different
clan
from
the
king
the
same
superstition
as
to
the
head
is
found
in
full
force
throughout
polynesia
thus
of
gattanewa
a
marquesan
chief
it
is
said
that
to
touch
the
top
of
his
head
or
anything
which
had
been
on
his
head
was
sacrilege
to
pass
over
his
head
was
an
indignity
never
to
be
forgotten
gattanewa
nay
all
his
family
scorned
to
pass
a
gateway
which
is
ever
closed
or
a
house
with
a
door
all
must
be
as
open
and
free
as
their
unrestrained
manners
he
would
pass
under
nothing
that
had
been
raised
by
the
hand
of
man
if
there
was
a
possibility
of
getting
round
or
over
it
often
have
i
seen
him
walk
the
whole
length
of
our
barrier
in
preference
to
passing
between
our
and
at
the
risk
of
his
life
scramble
over
the
loose
stones
of
a
wall
rather
than
go
through
the
marquesan
women
have
been
known
to
refuse
to
go
on
the
decks
of
ships
for
fear
of
passing
over
the
heads
of
chiefs
who
might
be
below
the
son
of
a
marquesan
high
priest
has
been
seen
to
roll
on
the
ground
in
an
agony
of
rage
and
despair
begging
for
death
because
some
one
had
desecrated
his
head
and
deprived
him
of
his
divinity
by
sprinkling
a
few
drops
of
water
on
his
hair
but
it
was
not
the
marquesan
chiefs
only
whose
heads
were
sacred
the
head
of
every
marquesan
was
taboo
and
might
neither
be
touched
nor
stepped
over
by
another
even
a
father
might
not
step
over
the
head
of
his
sleeping
child
women
were
forbidden
to
carry
or
touch
anything
that
had
been
in
contact
with
or
had
merely
hung
over
the
head
of
their
husband
or
father
no
one
was
allowed
to
be
over
the
head
of
the
king
of
tonga
in
hawaii
the
sandwich
islands
if
a
man
climbed
upon
a
chiefs
house
or
upon
the
wall
of
his
yard
he
was
put
to
death
if
his
shadow
fell
on
a
chief
he
was
put
to
death
if
he
walked
in
the
shadow
of
a
chiefs
house
with
his
head
painted
white
or
decked
with
a
garland
or
wetted
with
water
he
was
put
to
death
in
tahiti
any
one
who
stood
over
the
king
or
queen
or
passed
his
hand
over
their
heads
might
be
put
to
death
until
certain
rites
were
performed
over
it
a
tahitian
infant
was
especially
taboo
whatever
touched
the
child
s
head
while
it
was
in
this
state
became
sacred
and
was
deposited
in
a
consecrated
place
railed
in
for
the
purpose
at
the
child
s
house
if
a
branch
of
a
tree
touched
the
child
s
head
the
tree
was
cut
down
and
if
in
its
fall
it
injured
another
tree
so
as
to
penetrate
the
bark
that
tree
also
was
cut
down
as
unclean
and
unfit
for
use
after
the
rites
were
performed
these
special
taboos
ceased
but
the
head
of
a
tahitian
was
always
sacred
he
never
carried
anything
on
it
and
to
touch
it
was
an
offence
in
new
zealand
the
heads
of
the
chiefs
were
always
tabooed
hence
they
could
not
pass
or
sit
under
food
hung
up
or
carry
food
as
others
on
their
backs
neither
would
they
eat
a
meal
in
a
house
nor
touch
a
calabash
of
water
in
drinking
no
one
could
touch
their
head
nor
indeed
commonly
speak
of
it
or
allude
to
it
to
do
so
offensively
was
one
of
their
heaviest
curses
and
grossest
insults
only
to
be
wiped
out
with
so
sacred
was
the
head
of
a
maori
chief
that
if
he
only
touched
it
with
his
fingers
he
was
obliged
immediately
to
apply
them
to
his
nose
and
snuff
up
the
sanctity
which
they
had
acquired
by
the
touch
and
thus
restore
it
to
the
part
from
whence
it
was
on
account
of
the
sacredness
of
his
head
a
maori
chief
could
not
blow
the
fire
with
his
mouth
for
the
breath
being
sacred
communicated
his
sanctity
to
it
and
a
brand
might
be
taken
by
a
slave
or
a
man
of
another
tribe
or
the
fire
might
be
used
for
other
purposes
such
as
cooking
and
so
cause
his
it
is
a
crime
for
a
sacred
person
in
new
zealand
to
leave
his
comb
or
anything
else
which
has
touched
his
head
in
a
place
where
food
has
been
cooked
or
to
suffer
another
person
to
drink
out
of
any
vessel
which
has
touched
his
lips
hence
when
a
chief
wishes
to
drink
he
never
puts
his
lips
to
the
vessel
but
holds
his
hands
close
to
his
mouth
so
as
to
form
a
hollow
into
which
water
is
poured
by
another
person
and
thence
is
allowed
to
flow
into
his
mouth
if
a
light
is
needed
for
his
pipe
the
burning
ember
taken
from
the
fire
must
be
thrown
away
as
soon
as
it
is
used
for
the
pipe
becomes
sacred
because
it
has
touched
his
mouth
the
coal
becomes
sacred
because
it
has
touched
the
pipe
and
if
a
particle
of
the
sacred
cinder
were
replaced
on
the
common
fire
the
fire
would
also
become
sacred
and
could
no
longer
be
used
for
cooking
some
maori
chiefs
like
other
polynesians
object
to
go
down
into
a
ship
s
cabin
from
fear
of
people
passing
over
their
heads
dire
misfortune
was
thought
by
the
maoris
to
await
those
who
entered
a
house
where
any
article
of
animal
food
was
suspended
over
their
heads
a
dead
pigeon
or
a
piece
of
pork
hung
from
the
roof
was
a
better
protection
from
molestation
than
a
if
i
am
right
the
reason
for
the
special
objection
to
having
animal
food
over
the
head
is
the
fear
of
bringing
the
sacred
head
into
contact
with
the
spirit
of
the
animal
just
as
the
reason
why
the
flamen
dialis
might
not
walk
under
a
vine
was
the
fear
of
bringing
his
sacred
head
into
contact
with
the
spirit
of
the
vine
similarly
king
darius
would
not
pass
through
a
gate
over
which
there
was
a
tomb
because
in
doing
so
he
would
have
had
a
corpse
above
his
head
among
the
awuna
tribes
of
the
gold
coast
west
africa
the
worshippers
of
hebesio
the
god
of
thunder
believe
that
their
heads
are
sacred
being
associated
in
some
mysterious
way
with
the
presence
of
the
protective
spirit
of
their
god
which
has
passed
into
them
through
this
channel
at
baptism
hence
they
carefully
guard
their
heads
against
injury
especially
against
any
wound
that
might
draw
blood
for
they
think
that
such
a
wound
would
entail
the
loss
of
reason
on
the
sufferer
and
that
it
would
bring
down
the
wrath
of
the
thundering
god
and
of
his
the
fetish
priest
on
the
impious
smiter
hair
tabooed
when
the
head
was
considered
so
sacred
that
it
might
not
even
be
touched
without
grave
offence
it
is
obvious
that
the
cutting
of
the
hair
must
have
been
a
delicate
and
difficult
operation
the
difficulties
and
dangers
which
on
the
primitive
view
beset
the
operation
are
of
two
kinds
there
is
first
the
danger
of
disturbing
the
spirit
of
the
head
which
may
be
injured
in
the
process
and
may
revenge
itself
upon
the
person
who
molests
him
secondly
there
is
the
difficulty
of
disposing
of
the
shorn
locks
for
the
savage
believes
that
the
sympathetic
connexion
which
exists
between
himself
and
every
part
of
his
body
continues
to
exist
even
after
the
physical
connexion
has
been
broken
and
that
therefore
he
will
suffer
from
any
harm
that
may
befall
the
severed
parts
of
his
body
such
as
the
clippings
of
his
hair
or
the
parings
of
his
nails
accordingly
he
takes
care
that
these
severed
portions
of
himself
shall
not
be
left
in
places
where
they
might
either
be
exposed
to
accidental
injury
or
fall
into
the
hands
of
malicious
persons
who
might
work
magic
on
them
to
his
detriment
or
death
such
dangers
are
common
to
all
but
sacred
persons
have
more
to
fear
from
them
than
ordinary
people
so
the
precautions
taken
by
them
are
proportionately
stringent
the
simplest
way
of
evading
the
peril
is
not
to
cut
the
hair
at
all
and
this
is
the
expedient
adopted
where
the
risk
is
thought
to
be
more
than
usually
great
the
frankish
kings
were
never
allowed
to
crop
their
hair
from
their
childhood
upwards
they
had
to
keep
it
unshorn
to
poll
the
long
locks
that
floated
on
their
shoulders
would
have
been
to
renounce
their
right
to
the
throne
when
the
wicked
brothers
clotaire
and
childebert
coveted
the
kingdom
of
their
dead
brother
clodomir
they
inveigled
into
their
power
their
little
nephews
the
two
sons
of
clodomir
and
having
done
so
they
sent
a
messenger
bearing
scissors
and
a
naked
sword
to
the
children
s
grandmother
queen
clotilde
at
paris
the
envoy
shewed
the
scissors
and
the
sword
to
clotilde
and
bade
her
choose
whether
the
children
should
be
shorn
and
live
or
remain
unshorn
and
die
the
proud
queen
replied
that
if
her
grandchildren
were
not
to
come
to
the
throne
she
would
rather
see
them
dead
than
shorn
and
murdered
they
were
by
their
ruthless
uncle
clotaire
with
his
own
hand
the
king
of
ponape
one
of
the
caroline
islands

wear
his
hair
long
and
so
must
his
grandees
the
hair
of
the
aztec
priests
hung
down
to
their
hams
so
that
the
weight
of
it
became
very
troublesome
for
they
might
never
poll
it
so
long
as
they
lived
or
at
least
until
they
had
been
relieved
of
their
office

from
a
journey
his
first
duty
was
to
visit
the
rabba
and
poll
his
achilles
kept
unshorn
his
yellow
hair
because
his
father
had
vowed
to
offer
it
to
the
river
sperchius
if
ever
his
son
came
home
from
the
wars
beyond
the
sea
formerly
when
dyak
warriors
returned
with
the
heads
of
their
enemies
each
man
cut
off
a
lock
from
the
front
of
his
head
and
threw
it
into
the
river
as
a
mode
of
ending
the
taboo
to
which
they
had
been
subjected
during
the
expedition
bechuanas
after
a
battle
had
their
hair
shorn
by
their
mothers
in
order
that
new
hair
might
grow
and
that
all
which
was
old
and
polluted
might
disappear
and
be
no
again
men
who
have
taken
a
vow
of
vengeance
sometimes
keep
their
hair
unshorn
till
they
have
fulfilled
their
vow
thus
of
the
marquesans
we
are
told
that
occasionally
they
have
their
head
entirely
shaved
except
one
lock
on
the
crown
which
is
worn
loose
or
put
up
in
a
knot
but
the
latter
mode
of
wearing
the
hair
is
only
adopted
by
them
when
they
have
a
solemn
vow
as
to
revenge
the
death
of
some
near
relation
etc
in
such
case
the
lock
is
never
cut
off
until
they
have
fulfilled
their
a
similar
custom
was
sometimes
observed
by
the
ancient
germans
among
the
chatti
the
young
warriors
never
clipped
their
hair
or
their
beard
till
they
had
slain
an
enemy
six
thousand
saxons
once
swore
that
they
would
not
poll
their
hair
nor
shave
their
beards
until
they
had
taken
vengeance
on
their
foes
on
one
occasion
a
hawaiian
taboo
is
said
to
have
lasted
thirty
years
during
which
the
men
were
not
allowed
to
trim
their
beards
while
his
vow
lasted
a
nazarite
might
not
have
his
hair
cut
all
the
days
of
the
vow
of
his
separation
there
shall
no
razor
come
upon
his
possibly
in
this
case
there
was
a
special
objection
to
touching
the
tabooed
man
s
head
with
iron
the
roman
priests
as
we
have
seen
were
shorn
with
bronze
knives
the
same
feeling
perhaps
gave
rise
to
the
european
rule
that
a
child
s
nails
should
not
be
pared
during
the
first
year
but
that
if
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
shorten
them
they
should
be
bitten
off
by
the
mother
or
nurse
for
in
all
parts
of
the
world
a
young
child
is
believed
to
be
especially
exposed
to
supernatural
dangers
and
particular
precautions
are
taken
to
guard
it
against
them
in
other
words
the
child
is
under
a
number
of
taboos
of
which
the
rule
just
mentioned
is
one
among
hindus
the
usual
custom
seems
to
be
that
the
nails
of
a
child
are
cut
at
the
age
of
six
months
with
other
children
a
year
or
two
is
allowed
to
the
slave
hare
and
dogrib
indians
of
america
do
not
pare
the
nails
of
female
children
till
they
are
four
years
of
age
in
uganda
a
child
s
hair
may
not
be
cut
until
the
child
has
received
a
name
should
any
of
it
be
rubbed
or
plucked
off
accidentally
it
is
refastened
to
the
child
s
head
with
string
or
by
being
knotted
to
the
other
hair
amongst
the
ewe
negroes
of
the
slave
coast
a
mother
sometimes
vows
a
sacrifice
to
the
fetish
if
her
infant
should
live
she
then
leaves
the
child
unshorn
till
its
fourth
or
sixth
year
when
she
fulfils
her
vow
and
has
the
child
s
hair
cut
by
a
priest
to
this
day
a
syrian
mother
will
sometimes
like
hannah
devote
her
little
one
to
god
when
the
child
reaches
a
certain
age
its
hair
is
cut
and
weighed
and
money
is
paid
in
proportion
to
the
weight
if
the
boy
thus
dedicated
is
a
moslem
he
becomes
in
time
a
dervish
if
he
is
a
christian
he
becomes
a
monk
among
the
toradjas
of
central
celebes
when
a
child
s
hair
is
cut
to
rid
it
of
vermin
some
locks
are
allowed
to
remain
on
the
crown
of
the
head
as
a
refuge
for
one
of
the
child
s
souls
otherwise
the
soul
would
have
no
place
in
which
to
settle
and
the
child
would
sicken
the
of
sumatra
are
much
afraid
of
frightening
away
the
soul
of
a
child
hence
when
they
cut
its
hair
they
always
leave
a
patch
unshorn
to
which
the
soul
can
retreat
before
the
shears
usually
this
lock
remains
unshorn
all
through
life
or
at
least
up
till
manhood
in
some
parts
of
germany
it
is
thought
that
if
a
child
s
hair
is
combed
in
its
first
year
the
child
will
be
unlucky
or
that
if
a
boy
s
hair
is
cut
before
his
seventh
year
he
will
have
no
courage
ceremonies
at
but
when
it
becomes
necessary
to
crop
the
hair
measures
are
taken
to
lessen
the
dangers
which
are
supposed
to
attend
the
operation
the
chief
of
namosi
in
fiji
always
ate
a
man
by
way
of
precaution
when
he
had
had
his
hair
cut
there
was
a
certain
clan
that
had
to
provide
the
victim
and
they
used
to
sit
in
solemn
council
among
themselves
to
choose
him
it
was
a
sacrificial
feast
to
avert
evil
from
the
this
remarkable
custom
has
been
described
more
fully
by
another
observer
the
old
heathen
temple
at
namosi
is
called
rukunitambua
and
round
about
it
are
hundreds
of
stones
each
of
which
tells
a
fearful
tale
a
subject
tribe
whose
town
was
some
little
distance
from
namosi
had
committed
an
unpardonable
offence
and
were
condemned
to
a
frightful
doom
the
on
which
their
temple
had
stood
was
planted
with
the
mountain
arum
and
when
the
crop
was
ripe
the
poor
wretches
had
to
carry
it
down
to
namosi
and
give
at
least
one
of
their
number
to
be
killed
and
eaten
by
the
chief
he
used
to
take
advantage
of
these
occasions
to
have
his
hair
cut
for
the
human
sacrifice
was
supposed
to
avert
all
danger
of
witchcraft
if
any
got
hold
of
the
cuttings
of
his
hair
human
hair
being
the
most
dangerous
channel
for
the
deadliest
spells
of
the
sorcerers
the
stones
round
rukunitambua
represented
these
and
other
victims
who
had
been
killed
and
eaten
at
namosi
each
stone
was
the
record
of
a
murder
succeeded
by
a
cannibal
amongst
the
maoris
many
spells
were
uttered
at
one
for
example
was
spoken
to
consecrate
the
obsidian
knife
with
which
the
hair
was
cut
another
was
pronounced
to
avert
the
thunder
and
lightning
which
was
believed
to
cause
he
who
has
had
his
hair
cut
is
in
immediate
charge
of
the
atua
spirit
he
is
removed
from
the
contact
and
society
of
his
family
and
his
tribe
he
dare
not
touch
his
food
himself
it
is
put
into
his
mouth
by
another
person
nor
can
he
for
some
days
resume
his
accustomed
occupations
or
associate
with
his
the
person
who
cuts
the
hair
is
also
tabooed
his
hands
having
been
in
contact
with
a
sacred
head
he
may
not
touch
food
with
them
or
engage
in
any
other
employment
he
is
fed
by
another
person
with
food
cooked
over
a
sacred
fire
he
can
not
be
released
from
the
taboo
before
the
following
day
when
he
rubs
his
hands
with
potato
or
fern
root
which
has
been
cooked
on
a
sacred
fire
and
this
food
having
been
taken
to
the
head
of
the
family
in
the
female
line
and
eaten
by
her
his
hands
are
freed
from
the
taboo
in
some
parts
of
new
zealand
the
most
sacred
day
of
the
year
was
that
appointed
for
the
people
assembled
in
large
numbers
on
that
day
from
all
the
neighbourhood
sometimes
a
maori
chief
s
hair
was
shorn
by
his
wife
who
was
then
tabooed
for
a
week
as
a
consequence
of
having
touched
his
sacred
locks
it
is
an
affair
of
state
when
the
king
of
cambodia
s
hair
is
cropped
the
priests
place
on
the
barber
s
fingers
certain
old
rings
set
with
large
stones
which
are
supposed
to
contain
spirits
favourable
to
the
kings
and
during
the
operation
the
brahmans
keep
up
a
noisy
music
to
drive
away
the
evil
spirits
the
hair
and
nails
of
the
mikado
could
only
be
cut
while
he
was
asleep
perhaps
because
his
soul
being
then
absent
from
his
body
there
was
less
chance
of
injuring
it
with
the
shears
from
their
earliest
days
little
siamese
children
have
the
crown
of
the
head
clean
shorn
with
the
exception
of
a
single
small
tuft
of
hair
which
is
daily
combed
twisted
oiled
and
tied
in
a
little
knot
until
the
day
when
it
is
finally
removed
with
great
pomp
and
ceremony
the
ceremony
of
shaving
the
takes
place
before
the
child
has
reached
puberty
and
great
anxiety
is
felt
at
this
time
lest
the
or
who
commonly
resides
in
the
body
and
especially
the
head
of
every
siamese
should
be
so
disturbed
by
the
tonsure
as
to
depart
and
leave
the
child
a
hopeless
wreck
for
life
great
pains
are
therefore
taken
to
recall
this
mysterious
being
in
case
he
should
have
fled
and
to
fix
him
securely
in
the
child
this
is
the
object
of
an
elaborate
ceremony
performed
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
when
the
has
been
cut
a
miniature
pagoda
is
erected
and
on
it
are
placed
several
kinds
of
food
known
to
be
favourites
of
the
spirit
when
the
has
arrived
and
is
feasting
on
these
dainties
he
is
caught
and
held
fast
under
a
cloth
thrown
over
the
food
the
child
is
now
placed
near
the
pagoda
and
all
the
family
and
friends
form
a
circle
with
the
child
the
captured
spirit
and
the
brahman
priests
in
the
middle
hereupon
the
priests
address
the
spirit
earnestly
entreating
him
to
enter
into
the
child
they
amuse
him
with
tales
and
coax
and
wheedle
him
with
flattery
jest
and
song
the
gongs
ring
out
their
loudest
the
people
cheer
and
only
a
of
the
sourest
and
most
obdurate
disposition
could
resist
the
combined
appeal
the
last
sentences
of
the
formal
invocation
run
as
follows
benignant
thou
fickle
being
who
art
wont
to
wander
and
dally
about
from
the
moment
that
the
child
was
conceived
in
the
womb
thou
hast
enjoyed
every
pleasure
until
ten
lunar
months
having
elapsed
and
the
time
of
delivery
arrived
thou
hast
suffered
and
run
the
risk
of
perishing
by
being
born
alive
into
the
world
gracious
thou
wast
at
that
time
so
tender
delicate
and
wavering
as
to
cause
great
anxiety
concerning
thy
fate
thou
was
exactly
like
a
child
youthful
innocent
and
inexperienced
the
least
trifle
frightened
thee
and
made
thee
shudder
in
thy
infantile
playfulness
thou
wast
wont
to
frolic
and
wander
to
no
purpose
as
thou
didst
commence
to
learn
to
sit
and
unassisted
to
crawl
totteringly
on
all
fours
thou
wast
ever
falling
flat
on
thy
face
or
on
thy
back
as
thou
didst
grow
up
in
years
and
couldst
move
thy
steps
firmly
thou
didst
begin
to
run
and
sport
thoughtlessly
and
rashly
all
round
the
rooms
the
terrace
and
bridging
planks
of
travelling
boat
or
floating
house
and
at
times
thou
didst
fall
into
the
stream
creek
or
pond
among
the
floating
to
the
utter
dismay
of
those
to
whom
thy
existence
was
most
dear
o
gentle
come
into
thy
corporeal
abode
do
not
delay
this
auspicious
rite
thou
art
now
and
dost
form
everybody
s
delight
and
admiration
let
all
the
tiny
particles
of
that
have
fallen
on
land
or
water
assemble
and
take
permanent
abode
in
this
darling
little
child
let
them
all
hurry
to
the
site
of
this
auspicious
ceremony
and
admire
the
magnificent
preparations
made
for
them
in
this
the
brocaded
cloth
from
the
pagoda
under
which
lurks
the
captive
spirit
is
now
rolled
up
tightly
and
handed
to
the
child
who
is
told
to
clasp
it
firmly
to
his
breast
and
not
let
the
escape
further
the
child
drinks
the
milk
of
the
which
had
been
offered
to
the
spirit
and
by
thus
absorbing
the
food
of
the
ensures
the
presence
of
that
precious
spirit
in
his
body
a
magic
cord
is
tied
round
his
wrist
to
keep
off
the
wicked
spirits
who
would
lure
the
away
from
home
and
for
three
nights
he
sleeps
with
the
embroidered
cloth
from
the
pagoda
fast
clasped
in
his
arms
disposal
of
cut
hair
and
nails
but
even
when
the
hair
and
nails
have
been
safely
cut
there
remains
the
difficulty
of
disposing
of
them
for
their
owner
believes
himself
liable
to
suffer
from
any
harm
that
may
befall
them
the
notion
that
a
man
may
be
bewitched
by
means
of
the
clippings
of
his
hair
the
parings
of
his
nails
or
any
other
severed
portion
of
his
person
is
almost
and
attested
by
evidence
too
ample
too
familiar
and
too
tedious
in
its
uniformity
to
be
here
analysed
at
length
the
general
idea
on
which
the
superstition
rests
is
that
of
the
sympathetic
connexion
supposed
to
persist
between
a
person
and
everything
that
has
once
been
part
of
his
body
or
in
any
way
closely
related
to
him
a
very
few
examples
must
suffice
they
belong
to
that
branch
of
sympathetic
magic
which
may
be
called
contagious
thus
when
the
chilote
indians
inhabiting
the
wild
deeply
indented
coasts
and
dark
forests
of
southern
chili
get
possession
of
the
hair
of
an
enemy
they
drop
it
from
a
high
tree
or
tie
it
to
a
piece
of
seaweed
and
fling
it
into
the
surf
for
they
think
that
the
shock
of
the
fall
or
the
blows
of
the
waves
as
the
tress
is
tossed
to
and
fro
on
the
heaving
billows
will
be
transmitted
through
the
hair
to
the
person
from
whose
head
it
was
cut
dread
of
sorcery
we
are
told
formed
one
of
the
most
salient
characteristics
of
the
marquesan
islanders
in
the
old
days
the
sorcerer
took
some
of
the
hair
spittle
or
other
bodily
refuse
of
the
man
he
wished
to
injure
wrapped
it
up
in
a
leaf
and
placed
the
packet
in
a
bag
woven
of
threads
or
fibres
which
were
knotted
in
an
intricate
way
the
whole
was
then
buried
with
certain
rites
and
thereupon
the
victim
wasted
away
of
a
languishing
sickness
which
lasted
twenty
days
his
life
however
might
be
saved
by
discovering
and
digging
up
the
buried
hair
spittle
or
what
not
for
as
soon
as
this
was
done
the
power
of
the
charm
ceased
a
marquesan
chief
told
lieutenant
gamble
that
he
was
extremely
ill
the
happah
tribe
having
stolen
a
lock
of
his
hair
and
buried
it
in
a
plantain
leaf
for
the
purpose
of
taking
his
life
lieutenant
gamble
argued
with
him
but
in
vain
die
he
must
unless
the
hair
and
the
plantain
leaf
were
brought
back
to
him
and
to
obtain
them
he
had
offered
the
happahs
the
greater
part
of
his
property
he
complained
of
excessive
pain
in
the
head
breast
and
sides
a
maori
sorcerer
intent
on
bewitching
somebody
sought
to
get
a
tress
of
his
victim
s
hair
the
parings
of
his
nails
some
of
his
spittle
or
a
shred
of
his
garment
having
obtained
the
object
whatever
it
was
he
chanted
certain
spells
and
curses
over
it
in
a
falsetto
voice
and
buried
it
in
the
ground
as
the
thing
decayed
the
person
to
whom
it
had
belonged
was
supposed
to
waste
away
again
an
australian
girl
sick
of
a
fever
laid
the
blame
of
her
illness
on
a
young
man
who
had
come
behind
her
and
cut
off
a
lock
of
her
hair
she
was
sure
he
had
buried
it
and
that
it
was
rotting
her
hair
she
said
was
rotting
somewhere
and
her
kidney
fat
was
wasting
away
and
when
her
hair
had
completely
rotted
she
would
when
an
australian
blackfellow
wishes
to
get
rid
of
his
wife
he
cuts
off
a
lock
of
her
hair
in
her
sleep
ties
it
to
his
and
goes
with
it
to
a

his

fire
and
when
it
falls

it

a

that

the
way
in
which
the

operates
was
explained
to

by
a

man
you

he
said
when
a

doctor
gets
hold
of
something
belonging
to
a

and
roasts
it
with
things
and
sings
over
it
the

the

and
that
settles
the

a
slightly
different
form
of
the
charm
as
practised
in
australia
is
to
fasten
the
enemy
s
hair
with
wax
to
the
pinion
bone
of
a
hawk
and
set
the
bone
in
a
small
circle
of

according
as
the

desires
the
death
or
only
the
sickness
of
his
victim
he
leaves
the
bone
in
the

of
the
fire
or
removes
it
and
lays
it
in
the
sun
when
he
thinks
he
has
done
his

enough
harm
he
places
the

the
enchantment
lucian
describes
how
a
syrian
witch
professed
to
bring
back
a
faithless
lover
to
his
forsaken
fair
one
by
means
of
a
lock
of
his
hair
his
shoes
his
garments
or
something
of
that
sort
she
hung
the
hair
or
whatever
it
was
on
a
peg
and
fumigated
it
with
brimstone
sprinkling
salt
on
the
fire
and
mentioning
the
names
of
the
lover
and
his
lass
then
she
drew
a
magic
wheel
from
her
bosom
and
set
it
spinning
while
she
gabbled
a
spell
full
of
barbarous
and
fearsome
words
this
soon
brought
the
false
lover
back
to
the
feet
of
his
charmer
apuleius
tells
how
an
amorous
thessalian
witch
essayed
to
win
the
affections
of
a
handsome
boeotian
youth
by
similar
means
as
darkness
fell
she
mounted
the
roof
and
there
surrounded
by
a
hellish
array
of
dead
men
s
bones
she
knotted
the
severed
tresses
of
auburn
hair
and
threw
them
on
the
glowing
embers
of
a
perfumed
fire
but
her
cunning
handmaid
had
outwitted
her
the
hair
was
only
goat
s
hair
and
all
her
enchantments
ended
in
dismal
and
ludicrous
failure
the
huzuls
of
the
carpathians
imagine
that
if
mice
get
a
person
s
shorn
hair
and
make
a
nest
of
it
the
person
will
suffer
from
headache
or
even
become
idiotic
similarly
in
germany
it
is
a
common
notion
that
if
birds
find
a
person
s
cut
hair
and
build
their
nests
with
it
the
person
will
suffer
from
headache
sometimes
it
is
thought
that
he
will
have
an
eruption
on
the
head
the
same
superstition
prevails
or
used
to
prevail
in
west
sussex
i
knew
how
it
would
be
exclaimed
a
maidservant
one
day
when
i
saw
that
bird
fly
off
with
a
bit
of
my
hair
in
its
beak
that
blew
out
of
the
window
this
morning
when
i
was
dressing
i
knew
i
should
have
a
clapping
headache
and
so
i
in
like
manner
the
scottish
highlanders
believe
that
if
cut
or
loose
hair
is
allowed
to
blow
away
with
the
wind
and
it
passes
over
an
empty
nest
or
a
bird
takes
it
to
its
nest
the
head
from
which
it
came
will
ache
the
todas
of
southern
india
hide
their
clipped
hair
in
bushes
or
hollows
in
the
rocks
in
order
that
it
may
not
be
found
by
crows
and
they
bury
the
parings
of
their
nails
lest
they
should
be
eaten
by
buffaloes
with
whom
it
is
believed
they
would
disagree
again
it
is
thought
that
cut
or
hair
may
disturb
the
weather
by
producing
rain
and
hail
thunder
and
lightning
we
have
seen
that
in
new
zealand
a
spell
was
uttered
at
to
avert
thunder
and
lightning
in
the
tyrol
witches
are
supposed
to
use
cut
or
hair
to
make
hailstones
or
thunderstorms
with
thlinkeet
indians
have
been
known
to
attribute
stormy
weather
to
the
rash
act
of
a
girl
who
had
combed
her
hair
outside
of
the
house
the
romans
seem
to
have
held
similar
views
for
it
was
a
maxim
with
them
that
no
one
on
shipboard
should
cut
his
hair
or
nails
except
in
a
storm
that
is
when
the
mischief
was
already
done
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
it
is
said
that
no
sister
should
comb
her
hair
at
night
if
she
have
a
brother
at
sea
in
west
africa
when
the
mani
of
chitombe
or
jumba
died
the
people
used
to
run
in
crowds
to
the
corpse
and
tear
out
his
hair
teeth
and
nails
which
they
kept
as
a
believing
that
otherwise
no
rain
would
fall
the
makoko
of
the
anzikos
begged
the
missionaries
to
give
him
half
their
beards
as
a
when
du
chaillu
had
his
hair
cut
among
the
ashira
of
west
africa
the
people
scuffled
and
fought
for
the
clippings
of
his
hair
even
the
aged
king
himself
taking
part
in
the
scrimmage
every
one
who
succeeded
in
getting
some
of
the
hairs
wrapped
them
up
carefully
and
went
off
in
triumph
when
the
traveller
who
was
regarded
as
a
spirit
by
these
folk
asked
the
king
what
use
the
clippings
could
be
to
him
his
sable
majesty
replied
oh
spirit
these
hairs
are
very
precious
we
shall
make
fetiches
of
them
and
they
will
bring
other
white
men
to
us
and
bring
us
great
good
luck
and
riches
since
you
have
come
to
us
oh
spirit
we
have
wished
to
have
some
of
your
hair
but
did
not
dare
to
ask
for
it
not
knowing
that
it
could
be
the
wabondei
of
eastern
africa
preserve
the
hair
and
nails
of
their
dead
chiefs
and
use
them
both
for
the
making
of
rain
and
the
healing
of
the
sick
the
hair
beard
and
nails
of
their
deceased
chiefs
are
the
most
sacred
possession
the
most
precious
treasure
of
the
baronga
of
africa
preserved
in
pellets
of
wrapt
round
with
leathern
thongs
they
are
kept
in
a
special
hut
under
the
charge
of
a
high
priest
who
offers
sacrifices
and
prayers
at
certain
seasons
and
has
to
observe
strict
continence
for
a
month
before
he
handles
these
holy
relics
in
the
offices
of
religion
a
terrible
drought
was
once
the
result
of
this
palladium
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
in
some
victorian
tribes
the
sorcerer
used
to
burn
human
hair
in
time
of
drought
it
was
never
burned
at
other
times
for
fear
of
causing
a
deluge
of
rain
also
when
the
river
was
low
the
sorcerer
would
place
human
hair
in
the
stream
to
increase
the
supply
of
water
if
cut
hair
and
nails
remain
in
sympathetic
connexion
with
the
person
from
whose
body
they
have
been
severed
it
is
clear
that
they
can
be
used
as
hostages
for
his
good
behaviour
by
any
one
who
may
chance
to
possess
them
for
on
the
principles
of
contagious
magic
he
has
only
to
injure
the
hair
or
nails
in
order
to
hurt
simultaneously
their
original
owner
hence
when
the
nandi
have
taken
a
prisoner
they
shave
his
head
and
keep
the
shorn
hair
as
a
surety
that
he
will
not
attempt
to
escape
but
when
the
captive
is
ransomed
they
return
his
shorn
hair
with
him
to
his
own
people
for
a
similar
reason
perhaps
when
the
tiaha
an
arab
tribe
of
moab
have
taken
a
prisoner
whom
they
do
not
wish
to
put
to
death
they
shave
one
corner
of
his
head
above
his
temples
and
let
him
go
so
too
an
arab
of
moab
who
pardons
a
murderer
will
sometimes
cut
off
the
man
s
hair
and
shave
his
chin
before
releasing
him
again
when
two
moabite
arabs
had
got
hold
of
a
traitor
who
had
revealed
their
plan
of
campaign
to
the
enemy
they
contented
themselves
with
shaving
completely
one
side
of
his
head
and
his
moustache
on
the
other
after
which
they
set
him
at
liberty
we
can
now
perhaps
understand
why
hanun
king
of
ammon
shaved
off
of
the
beards
of
king
david
s
messengers
and
cut
off
half
their
garments
before
he
sent
them
back
to
their
master
his
intention
we
may
conjecture
was
not
simply
to
put
a
gross
affront
on
the
envoys
he
distrusted
the
ambitious
designs
of
king
david
and
wished
to
have
some
guarantee
of
the
maintenance
of
peace
and
friendly
relations
between
the
two
countries
that
guarantee
he
may
have
imagined
that
he
possessed
in
half
of
the
beards
and
garments
of
the
ambassadors
and
if
that
was
so
we
may
suppose
that
when
the
indignant
david
set
the
army
of
israel
in
motion
against
ammon
and
the
fords
of
jordan
were
alive
with
the
passage
of
his
troops
the
wizards
of
ammon
were
busy
in
the
strong
keep
of
rabbah
muttering
their
weird
spells
and
performing
their
quaint
enchantments
over
the
shorn
hair
and
severed
skirts
in
order
to
dispel
the
thundercloud
of
war
that
was
gathering
black
about
their
country
vain
hopes
the
city
fell
and
from
the
gates
the
sad
inhabitants
trooped
forth
in
thousands
to
be
laid
in
long
lines
on
the
ground
and
sawed
asunder
or
ripped
up
with
harrows
or
to
walk
into
the
red
glow
of
the
burning
brick
kilns
again
the
parings
of
nails
may
serve
the
same
purpose
as
the
clippings
of
hair
they
too
may
be
treated
as
bail
for
the
good
behaviour
of
the
persons
from
whose
fingers
they
have
been
cut
it
is
apparently
on
this
principle
that
when
the
of
the
congo
valley
cement
a
peace
the
chiefs
of
the
two
tribes
meet
and
eat
a
cake
which
contains
some
of
their
as
a
pledge
of
the
maintenance
of
the
treaty
they
believe
that
he
who
breaks
an
engagement
contracted
in
this
solemn
manner
will
die
each
of
the
high
contracting
parties
has
in
fact
given
hostages
to
fortune
in
the
shape
of
the
which
are
lodged
in
the
other
man
s
stomach
to
preserve
the
cut
hair
and
nails
from
injury
and
from
the
dangerous
uses
to
which
they
may
be
put
by
sorcerers
it
is
necessary
to
deposit
them
in
some
safe
place
hence
the
natives
of
the
maldives
carefully
keep
the
cuttings
of
their
hair
and
nails
and
bury
them
with
a
little
water
in
the
cemeteries
for
they
would
not
for
the
world
tread
upon
them
nor
cast
them
in
the
fire
for
they
say
that
they
are
part
of
their
body
and
demand
burial
as
it
does
and
indeed
they
fold
them
neatly
in
cotton
and
most
of
them
like
to
be
shaved
at
the
gates
of
temples
and
in
new
zealand
the
severed
hair
was
deposited
on
some
sacred
spot
of
ground
to
protect
it
from
being
touched
accidentally
or
designedly
by
any
the
shorn
locks
of
a
chief
were
gathered
with
much
care
and
placed
in
an
adjoining
cemetery
the
tahitians
buried
the
cuttings
of
their
hair
at
the
temples
in
the
streets
of
soku
west
africa
a
modern
traveller
observed
cairns
of
large
stones
piled
against
walls
with
tufts
of
human
hair
inserted
in
the
crevices
on
asking
the
meaning
of
this
he
was
told
that
when
any
native
of
the
place
polled
his
hair
he
carefully
gathered
up
the
clippings
and
deposited
them
in
one
of
these
cairns
all
of
which
were
sacred
to
the
fetish
and
therefore
inviolable
these
cairns
of
sacred
stones
he
further
learned
were
simply
a
precaution
against
witchcraft
for
if
a
man
were
not
thus
careful
in
disposing
of
his
hair
some
of
it
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
who
would
by
means
of
it
be
able
to
cast
spells
over
him
and
so
compass
his
destruction
when
the
of
a
siamese
child
has
been
cut
with
great
ceremony
the
short
hairs
are
put
into
a
little
vessel
made
of
plantain
leaves
and
set
adrift
on
the
nearest
river
or
canal
as
they
float
away
all
that
was
wrong
or
harmful
in
the
child
s
disposition
is
believed
to
depart
with
them
the
long
hairs
are
kept
till
the
child
makes
a
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
footprint
of
buddha
on
the
sacred
hill
at
prabat
they
are
then
presented
to
the
priests
who
are
supposed
to
make
them
into
brushes
with
which
they
sweep
the
footprint
but
in
fact
so
much
hair
is
thus
offered
every
year
that
the
priests
can
not
use
it
all
so
they
quietly
burn
the
superfluity
as
soon
as
the
pilgrims
backs
are
turned
the
cut
hair
and
nails
of
the
flamen
dialis
were
buried
under
a
lucky
tree
the
shorn
tresses
of
the
vestal
virgins
were
hung
on
an
ancient
in
morocco
women
often
hang
their
cut
hair
on
a
tree
that
grows
on
or
near
the
grave
of
a
saint
for
they
think
thus
to
rid
themselves
of
headache
or
to
guard
against
it
in
germany
the
clippings
of
hair
used
often
to
be
buried
under
an
in
oldenburg
cut
hair
and
nails
are
wrapt
in
a
cloth
which
is
deposited
in
a
hole
in
an
three
days
before
the
new
moon
the
hole
is
then
plugged
up
in
the
west
of
northumberland
it
is
thought
that
if
the
first
parings
of
a
child
s
nails
are
buried
under
an
the
child
will
turn
out
a
fine
singer
in
amboyna
before
a
child
may
taste
for
the
first
time
the
father
cuts
off
a
lock
of
the
infant
s
hair
which
he
buries
under
a
in
the
aru
islands
when
a
child
is
able
to
run
alone
a
female
relation
shears
a
lock
of
its
hair
and
deposits
it
on
a
in
the
island
of
rotti
it
is
thought
that
the
first
hair
which
a
child
gets
is
not
his
own
and
that
if
it
is
not
cut
off
it
will
make
him
weak
and
ill
hence
when
the
child
is
about
a
month
old
his
hair
is
polled
with
much
ceremony
as
each
of
the
friends
who
are
invited
to
the
ceremony
enters
the
house
he
goes
up
to
the
child
snips
off
a
little
of
its
hair
and
drops
it
into
a
shell
full
of
water
afterwards
the
father
or
another
relation
takes
the
hair
and
packs
it
into
a
little
bag
made
of
leaves
which
he
fastens
to
the
top
of
a
then
he
gives
the
leaves
of
the
palm
a
good
shaking
climbs
down
and
goes
home
without
speaking
to
any
one
indians
of
the
yukon
territory
alaska
do
not
throw
away
their
cut
hair
and
nails
but
tie
them
up
in
little
bundles
and
place
them
in
the
crotches
of
trees
or
wherever
they
are
not
likely
to
be
disturbed
by
beasts
for
they
have
a
superstition
that
disease
will
follow
the
disturbance
of
such
remains
by
often
the
clipped
hair
and
nails
are
stowed
away
in
any
secret
place
not
necessarily
in
a
temple
or
cemetery
or
at
a
tree
as
in
the
cases
already
mentioned
thus
in
swabia
you
are
recommended
to
deposit
your
clipped
hair
in
some
spot
where
neither
sun
nor
moon
can
shine
on
it
for
example
in
the
earth
or
under
a
stone
in
danzig
it
is
buried
in
a
bag
under
the
threshold
in
ugi
one
of
the
solomon
islands
men
bury
their
hair
lest
it
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
an
enemy
who
would
make
magic
with
it
and
so
bring
sickness
or
calamity
on
them
the
same
fear
seems
to
be
general
in
melanesia
and
has
led
to
a
regular
practice
of
hiding
cut
hair
and
nails
in
fiji
the
shorn
hair
is
concealed
in
the
thatch
of
the
house
most
burmese
and
shans
tie
the
combings
of
their
hair
and
the
parings
of
their
nails
to
a
stone
and
sink
them
in
deep
water
or
bury
them
in
the
ground
the
directs
that
the
clippings
of
hair
and
the
parings
of
nails
shall
be
placed
in
separate
holes
and
that
three
six
or
nine
furrows
shall
be
drawn
round
each
hole
with
a
metal
knife
in
the
it
is
provided
that
the
hair
cut
from
a

the
are
careful

collect
and
bury
both
their

and

in
safe
places
the
same
practice
prevails
among
many
tribes
of
south
africa
from
a
fear
lest
wizards
should
get
hold
of
the
severed
particles
and
work
evil
with
them
the
caffres
carry
still
further
this
dread
of
allowing
any
portion
of
themselves
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
an
enemy
for
not
only
do
they
bury
their
cut
hair
and
nails
in
a
secret
spot
but
when
one
of
them
cleans
the
head
of
another
he
preserves
the
vermin
which
he
catches
carefully
delivering
them
to
the
person
to
whom
they
originally
appertained
supposing
according
to
their
theory
that
as
they
derived
their
support
from
the
blood
of
the
man
from
whom
they
were
taken
should
they
be
killed
by
another
the

of
his

be
in
his
possession
thus
placing
in
his
hands
the
power
of
some
superhuman
amongst
the
wanyoro
of
central
africa
all
cuttings
of
the
hair
and
nails
are
carefully
stored
under
the
bed
and
afterwards
strewed
about
among
the
tall
grass
similarly
the
wahoko
of

take
pains
to
collect
their
cut
hair
and

and
scatter
them
in

hide
the

the
parings

throw
them
away
far
from
the
kraal
lest
a
sorcerer
should
get
hold
of
them
and
make
their
original
owners
ill
by
his
magic
in
north
guinea
the
parings
of
the
and
the
shorn
locks
of
the
head
are
scrupulously
concealed
lest
they
be
converted
into
a
charm
for
the
destruction
of
the
person
to
whom
they
belong
for
the
same
reason
the
clipped
hair
and
of
chiefs
in
southern
nigeria
are
secretly
buried
among
the
thompson
indians
of
british
columbia
loose
hair
was
buried
hidden
or
thrown
into
the
water
because
if
an
enemy
got
hold
of
it
he
might
bewitch
the
owner
in
bolang
mongondo
a
district
of
western
celebes
the
first
hair
cut
from
a
child
s
head
is
kept
in
a
young
which
is
commonly
hung
on
the
front
of
the
house
under
the
roof
to
spit
upon
the
hair
before
throwing
it
away
is
thought
in
some
parts
of
europe
to
be
a
sufficient
safeguard
against
its
use
by
witches
spitting
as
a
protective
charm
is
well
known
sometimes
the
severed
hair
and
nails
are
preserved
not
to
prevent
them
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
a
magician
but
that
the
owner
may
have
them
at
the
resurrection
of
the
body
to
which
some
races
look
forward
thus
the
incas
of
peru
took
extreme
care
to
preserve
the
and
the
hairs
that
were
shorn
off
or
torn
out
with
a
comb
placing
them
in
holes
or
niches
in
the
walls
and
if
they
fell
out
any
other
indian
that
saw
them
picked
them
up
and
put
them
in
their
places
again
i
very
often
asked
different
indians
at
various
times
why
they
did
this
in
order
to
see
what
they
would
say
and
they
all
replied
in
the
same
words
saying
know
that
all
persons
who
are
born
must
return
to
life
they
have
no
word
to
express
resuscitation
and
the
souls
must
rise
out
of
their
tombs
with
all
that
belonged
to
their
bodies
we
therefore
in
order
that
we
may
not
have
to
search
for
our
hair
and
nails
at
a
time
when
there
will
be
much
hurry
and
confusion
place
them
in
one
place
that
they
may
be
brought
together
more
conveniently
and
whenever
it
is
possible
we
are
also
careful
to
spit
in
one
in
chili
this
custom
of
stuffing
the
shorn
hair
into
holes
in
the
wall
is
still
observed
it
being
thought
the
height
of
imprudence
to
throw
the
hair
away
similarly
the
turks
never
throw
away
the
parings
of
their
nails
but
carefully
stow
them
in
cracks
of
the
walls
or
of
the
boards
in
the
belief
that
they
will
be
needed
at
the
resurrection
the
armenians
do
not
throw
away
their
cut
hair
and
nails
and
extracted
teeth
but
hide
them
in
places
that
are
esteemed
holy
such
as
a
crack
in
the
church
wall
a
pillar
of
the
house
or
a
hollow
tree
they
think
that
all
these
severed
portions
of
themselves
will
be
wanted
at
the
resurrection
and
that
he
who
has
not
stowed
them
away
in
a
safe
place
will
have
to
hunt
about
for
them
on
the
great
day
with
the
same
intention
the
macedonians
bury
the
parings
of
their
nails
in
a
hole
and
devout
moslems
in
morocco
hide
them
in
a
secret
place
similarly
the
arabs
of
moab
bestow
the
parings
of
their
nails
in
the
crannies
of
walls
where
they
are
sanguine
enough
to
expect
to
find
them
when
they
appear
before
their
maker
some
of
the
esthonians
keep
the
parings
of
their
finger
and
toe
nails
in
their
bosom
in
order
to
have
them
at
hand
when
they
are
asked
for
them
at
the
day
of
judgment
in
a
like
spirit
peasants
of
the
vosges
will
sometimes
bury
their
extracted
teeth
secretly
marking
the
spot
well
so
that
they
may
be
able
to
walk
straight
to
it
on
the
resurrection
day
in
the
village
of
drumconrath
near
abbeyleix
in
ireland
there
used
to
be
some
old
women
who
having
ascertained
from
scripture
that
the
hairs
of
their
heads
were
all
numbered
by
the
almighty
expected
to
have
to
account
for
them
at
the
day
of
judgment
in
order
to
be
able
to
do
so
they
stuffed
the
severed
hair
away
in
the
thatch
of
their
cottages
in
abyssinia
men
who
have
had
their
hands
or
feet
cut
off
are
careful
to
dry
the
severed
limbs
over
a
fire
and
preserve
them
in
butter
for
the
purpose
of
being
buried
with
them
in
the
grave
thus
they
expect
to
get
up
with
all
their
limbs
complete
at
the
general
rising
the
pains
taken
by
the
chinese
to
preserve
corpses
entire
and
free
from
decay
seems
to
rest
on
a
firm
belief
in
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
hence
it
is
natural
to
find
their
ancient
books
laying
down
a
rule
that
the
hair
nails
and
teeth
which
have
fallen
out
during
life
should
be
buried
with
the
dead
in
the
coffin
or
at
least
in
the
grave
the
fors
of

africa
object
to
cut
any
one
else
s
nails
for
should
the
part
cut
off
be
lost
and
not
delivered
into
its
owner
s
hands
it
will
have
to
be
made
up
to
him
somehow
or
other
after
death
the
parings
are
buried
in
the
ground
some
people
burn
their
loose
hair
to
save
it
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
sorcerers
this
is
done
by
the
patagonians
and
some
of
the
victorian
tribes
in
the
upper
vosges
they
say
that
you
should
never
leave
the
clippings
of
your
hair
and
nails
lying
about
but
burn
them
to
hinder
the
sorcerers
from
using
them
against
you
for
the
same
reason
italian
women
either
burn
their
loose
hairs
or
throw
them
into
a
place
where
no
one
is
likely
to
look
for
them
the
almost
universal
dread
of
witchcraft
induces
the
west
african
negroes
the
makololo
of
south
africa
and
the
tahitians
to
burn
or
bury
their
shorn
hair
for
the
same
reason
the
natives
of
uap
one
of
the
caroline
islands
either
burn
or
throw
into
the
sea
the
clippings
of
their
hair
and
the
parings
of
their
nails
one
of
the
pygmies
who
roam
through
the
gloomy
depths
of
the
vast
central
african
forests
has
been
seen
to
collect
carefully
the
clippings
of
his
hair
in
a
packet
of
banana
leaves
and
keep
them
till
next
morning
when
the
camp
breaking
up
for
the
day
s
march
he
threw
them
into
the
hot
ashes
of
the
abandoned
fire
australian
aborigines
of
the
proserpine
river
in
queensland
burn
a
woman
s
cut
hair
to
prevent
it
from
getting
into
a
man
s
bag
for
if
it
did
the
woman
would
fall
when
an
english
officer
had
cut
off
a
lock
of
hair
of
a
fuegian
woman
the
men
of
her
party
were
angry
and
one
of
them
taking
the
lock
away
threw
half
of
it
into
the
fire
and
swallowed
the
rest
immediately
afterwards
placing
his
hands
to
the
fire
as
if
to
warm
them
and
looking
upwards
he
uttered
a
few
words
apparently
of
invocation
then
looking
at
us
pointed
upwards
and
exclaimed
with
a
tone
and
gesture
of
explanation
after
which
they
cut
off
some
hair
from
several
of
the
officers
who
were
present
and
repeated
a
similar
the
thompson
indians
used
to
burn
the
parings
of
their
nails
because
if
an
enemy
got
possession
of
the
parings
he
might
bewitch
the
person
to
whom
they
belonged
in
the
tyrol
many
people
burn
their
hair
lest
the
witches
should
use
it
to
raise
thunderstorms
others
burn
or
bury
it
to
prevent
the
birds
from
lining
their
nests
with
it
which
would
cause
the
heads
from
which
the
hair
came
to
ache
cut
and
hair
is
burned
in
pomerania
and
sometimes
in
belgium
in
norway
the
parings
of
nails
are
either
burned
or
buried
lest
the
elves
or
the
finns
should
find
them
and
make
them
into
bullets
wherewith
to
shoot
the
cattle
in
corea
all
the
clippings
and
combings
of
the
hair
of
a
whole
family
are
carefully
preserved
throughout
the
year
and
then
burned
in
potsherds
outside
the
house
on
the
evening
of
new
year
s
day
at
such
seasons
the
streets
of
seoul
the
capital
present
a
weird
spectacle
they
are
for
the
most
part
silent
and
deserted
sometimes
muffled
deep
in
snow
but
through
the
dusk
of
twilight
red
lights
glimmer
at
every
door
where
little
groups
are
busy
tending
tiny
fires
whose
flickering
flames
cast
a
ruddy
fitful
glow
on
the
moving
figures
the
burning
of
the
hair
in
these
fires
is
thought
to
exclude
demons
from
the
house
for
a
year
but
coupled
with
this
belief
may
well
be
or
once
have
been
a
wish
to
put
these
relics
out
of
the
reach
of
witches
and
wizards
this
destruction
of
the
hair
and
nails
plainly
involves
an
inconsistency
of
thought
the
object
of
the
destruction
is
avowedly
to
prevent
these
severed
portions
of
the
body
from
being
used
by
sorcerers
but
the
possibility
of
their
being
so
used
depends
upon
the
supposed
sympathetic
connexion
between
them
and
the
man
from
whom
they
were
severed
and
if
this
sympathetic
connexion
still
exists
clearly
these
severed
portions
can
not
be
destroyed
without
injury
to
the
man
before
leaving
this
subject
on
which
i
have
perhaps
dwelt
too
long
it
may
be
well
to
call
attention
to
the
motive
assigned
for
cutting
a
young
child
s
hair
in
rotti
in
that
island
the
first
hair
is
regarded
as
a
danger
to
the
child
and
its
removal
is
intended
to
avert
the
danger
the
reason
of
this
may
be
that
as
a
young
child
is
almost
universally
supposed
to
be
in
a
tabooed
or
dangerous
state
it
is
necessary
in
removing
the
taboo
to
remove
also
the
separable
parts
of
the
child
s
body
because
they
are
infected
so
to
say
by
the
virus
of
taboo
and
as
such
are
dangerous
the
cutting
of
the
child
s
hair
would
thus
be
exactly
parallel
to
the
destruction
of
the
vessels
which
have
been
used
by
a
tabooed
person
this
view
is
borne
out
by
a
practice
observed
by
some
australians
of
burning
off
part
of
a
woman
s
hair
after
childbirth
as
well
as
burning
every
vessel
which
has
been
used
by
her
during
her
seclusion
here
the
burning
of
the
woman
s
hair
seems
plainly
intended
to
serve
the
same
purpose
as
the
burning
of
the
vessels
used
by
her
and
as
the
vessels
are
burned
because
they
are
believed
to
be
tainted
with
a
dangerous
infection
so
we
must
suppose
is
also
the
hair
similarly
among
the
latuka
of
central
africa
a
woman
is
secluded
for
fourteen
days
after
the
birth
of
her
child
and
at
the
end
of
her
seclusion
her
hair
is
shaved
off
and
burnt
again
we
have
seen
that
girls
at
puberty
are
strongly
infected
with
taboo
hence
it
is
not
surprising
to
find
that
the
ticunas
of
brazil
tear
out
all
the
hair
of
girls
at
that
period
once
more
the
father
of
twins
in
uganda
is
tabooed
for
some
time
after
the
birth
of
the
children
and
during
that
time
he
may
not
dress
his
hair
nor
cut
his
finger
nails
this
state
of
taboo
lasts
until
the
next
war
breaks
out
when
the
army
is
under
orders
to
march
the
father
of
twins
has
the
whole
of
his
body
shaved
and
his
nails
cut
the
shorn
hair
and
the
cut
nails
are
then
tied
up
in
a
ball
which
the
man
takes
with
him
to
the
war
together
with
the
bark
cloth
he
wore
at
the
ceremonial
dances
after
the
birth
of
the
twins
when
he
has
killed
a
foe
he
crams
the
ball
into
the
dead
man
s
mouth
ties
the
bark
cloth
round
the
neck
of
the
corpse
and
leaves
them
there
on
the
battlefield
the
ceremony
appears
to
be
intended
to
rid
the
man
of
the
taint
of
taboo
which
may
be
supposed
to
adhere
to
his
hair
nails
and
the
garment
he
wore
hence
we
can
understand
the
importance
attached
by
many
peoples
to
the
first
cutting
of
a
child
s
hair
and
the
elaborate
ceremonies
by
which
the
operation
is
accompanied
again
we
can
understand
why
a
man
should
poll
his
head
after
a
journey
for
we
have
seen
that
a
traveller
is
often
believed
to
contract
a
dangerous
infection
from
strangers
and
that
therefore
on
his
return
home
he
is
obliged
to
submit
to
various
purificatory
ceremonies
before
he
is
allowed
to
mingle
freely
with
his
own
people
on
my
hypothesis
the
polling
of
the
hair
is
simply
one
of
these
purificatory
or
disinfectant
ceremonies
certainly
this
explanation
applies
to
the
custom
as
practised
by
the
bechuanas
for
we
are
expressly
told
that
they
cleanse
or
purify
themselves
after
journeys
by
shaving
their
heads
lest
they
should
have
contracted
from
strangers
some
evil
by
witchcraft
or
the
cutting
of
the
hair
after
a
vow
may
have
the
same
meaning
it
is
a
way
of
ridding
the
man
of
what
has
been
infected
by
the
dangerous
state
whether
we
call
it
taboo
sanctity
or
uncleanness
for
all
these
are
only
different
expressions
for
the
same
primitive
conception
under
which
he
laboured
during
the
continuance
of
the
vow
still
more
clearly
does
the
meaning
of
the
practice
come
out
in
the
case
of
mourners
who
cut
their
hair
and
nails
and
use
new
vessels
when
the
period
of
their
mourning
is
at
an
end
this
was
done
in
ancient
india
obviously
for
the
purpose
of
purifying
such
persons
from
the
dangerous
influence
of
death
and
the
ghost
to
which
for
a
time
they
had
been
exposed
among
the
bodos
and
dhimals
of
assam
when
a
death
has
occurred
the
family
of
the
deceased
is
reckoned
unclean
for
three
days
at
the
end
of
that
time
they
bathe
shave
and
are
sprinkled
with
holy

the

has
led
so
many

the

on

a

in

will

away
as

smoke
or
he
will
put
the
spittle
in
a
frog
and
throw
the
animal
into
an
inaccessible
unnavigable
river
which
will
make
the
victim
quake
and
shake
with
ague
when
a
cherokee
sorcerer
desires
to

he
gathers
up
his
victim
s
spittle
on
a
stick
and
puts
it
in

of
wild
parsnip
together
with
seven
earthworms
beaten
to
a
paste
and
several
splinters
from
a

he
then
goes
into

digs
a

at

foot
of
a

which
has
been
struck
by
lightning
and
deposits
in
the
hole
the
joint
of
wild
parsnip
with
its
contents
further
he
lays
seven
yellow
stones
in
the
hole
then
fills
in
the
earth
and
makes
a
fire
over
the
spot
to
destroy
all
traces
of
his
work
if
the
ceremony
has
been
properly
carried
out
the
man
whose
spittle
has
thus
been
treated
begins
to
feel
ill
at
once
his
soul
shrivels
up
and
dwindles
and
within
seven
days
he
is
a
dead
man
in
the
east
indian
island
of
siaoo
or
siauw
one
of
the

group
there
are
witches
who
by
means
of
hellish
charms
compounded
from
the
roots
of
plants
can
change
their
shape
and
bring
sickness
and
misfortune
on
other
folk
these
hags
also
crawl
under
the
houses
which
are
raised
above
the
ground
on
posts
and
there
gathering
up
the
spittle
of
the
inmates
cause
them
to
fall

a

sorcerer
can
not
get
the

of
his
foe
a
shred
of
his
rug
or
something
else
that
belongs
to
the
man
he
will
watch
till
he
sees
him
spit
when
he
will
carefully
pick
up
the
spittle
with
a
stick
and
use
it
for
the
destruction
of
the
careless
spitter
the
natives
of
urewera
a
district
in
the
north
island
of
new
zealand
enjoyed
a
high
reputation
for
their
skill
in
magic
it
was
said
that
they
made
use
of
people
s
spittle
to
bewitch
them
hence
visitors
were
careful
to
conceal
their
spittle
lest
they
should
furnish
these
wizards
with
a
handle
for
working
them
harm
similarly
among
some
tribes
of
south
africa
no
man
will
spit
when
an
enemy
is
near
lest
his
foe
should
find
the
spittle
and
give
it
to
a
wizard
who
would
then
mix
it
with
magical
ingredients
so
as
to
injure
the
person
from
whom
it
fell
even
in
a
man
s
own
house
his
saliva
is
carefully
swept
away
and
obliterated
for
a
similar
reason
for
a
like
reason
no
doubt
the
natives
of
the
marianne
islands
use
great
precautions
in
spitting
and
take
care
never
to
expectorate
near
somebody
else
s
house
negroes
of
senegal
the
bissagos
archipelago
and
some
of
the
west
indian
islands
such
as
guadeloupe
and
martinique
are
also
careful
to
efface
their
spittle
by
pressing
it
into
the
ground
with
their
feet
lest
a
sorcerer
should
use
it
to
their
hurt
natives
of
astrolabe
bay
in
german
new
guinea
wipe
out
their
spittle
for
the
same
reason
and
a
like
dread
of
sorcery
prevents
some
natives
of
german
new
guinea
from
spitting
on
the
ground
in
presence
of
others
the
telugus
say
that
if
a
man
rinsing
his
teeth
with
charcoal
in
the
mornings
spits
on
the
road
and
somebody
else
treads
on
his
spittle
the
spitter
will
be
laid
up
with
a
sharp
attack
of
fever
for
two
or
three
days
hence
all
who
wish
to
avoid
the
ailment
should
at
once
efface
their
spittle
by
sprinkling
water
on
it
if
common
folk
are
thus
cautious
it
is
natural
that
kings
and
chiefs
should
be
doubly
so
in
the
sandwich
islands
chiefs
were
attended
by
a
confidential
servant
bearing
a
portable
spittoon
and
the
deposit
was
carefully
buried
every
morning
to
put
it
out
of
the
reach
of
sorcerers
on
the
slave
coast
of
africa
for
the
same
reason
whenever
a
king
or
chief
expectorates
the
saliva
is
scrupulously
gathered
up
and
hidden
or
buried
the
same
precautions
are
taken
for
the
same
reason
with
the
spittle
of
the
chief
of
tabali
in
southern
nigeria
at
bulebane
in
senegambia
a
french
traveller
observed
a
captive
engaged
with
an
air
of
great
importance
in
covering
over
with
sand
all
the
spittle
that
fell
from
the
lips
of
a
native
dignitary
the
man
used
a
small
stick
for
the
purpose
who
carry
tails
of
elephants
hasten
to
sweep
up
or
cover
with
sand
the
spittle
of
the
king
of
ashantee
an
attendant
used
to
perform
a
similar
service
for
the
king
of
congo
and
a
custom
of
the
same
sort
prevails
or
used
to
prevail
at
the
court
of
the
muata
jamwo
in
the
interior
of
angola
in
yap
one
of
the
caroline
islands
there
are
two
great
wizards
the
head
of
all
the
magicians
whose
exalted
dignity
compels
them
to
lead
a
very
strict
life
they
may
eat
fruit
only
from
plants
or
trees
which
are
grown
specially
for
them
when
one
of
them
goes
abroad
the
other
must
stay
at
home
for
if
they
were
to
meet
each
other
on
the
road
some
direful
calamity
would
surely
follow
though
they
may
not
smoke
tobacco
they
are
allowed
to
chew
a
quid
of
betel
but
that
which
they
expectorate
is
carefully
gathered
up
carried
away
and
burned
in
a
special
manner
lest
any
person
should
get
possession
of
the
spittle
and
do
their
reverences
a
mischief
by
uttering
a
curse
over
it
among
the
guaycurus
and
payaguas
of
brazil
when
a
chief
spat
the
persons
about
him
received
his
saliva
on
their
hands
probably
in
order
to
prevent
it
from
being
misused
by
magicians
the
magical
use
to
which
spittle
may
be
put
marks
it
out
like
blood
or
as
a
suitable
material
basis
for
a
covenant
since
by
exchanging
their
saliva
the
covenanting
parties
give
each
other
a
guarantee
of
good
faith
if
either
of
them
afterwards
forswears
himself
the
other
can
punish
his
perfidy
by
a
magical
treatment
of
the
perjurer
s
spittle
which
he
has
in
his
custody
thus
when
the
wajagga
of
east
africa
desire
to
make
a
covenant
the
two
parties
will
sometimes
sit
down
with
a
bowl
of
milk
or
beer
between
them
and
after
uttering
an
incantation
over
the
beverage
they
each
take
a
mouthful
of
the
milk
or
beer
and
spit
it
into
the
other
s
mouth
in
urgent
cases
when
there
is
no
time
to
stand
on
ceremony
the
two
will
simply
spit
into
each
other
s
mouth
which
seals
the
covenant
just
as
well
foods
tabooed
as
might
have
been
expected
the
superstitions
of
the
savage
cluster
thick
about
the
subject
of
food
and
he
abstains
from
eating
many
animals
and
plants
wholesome
enough
in
themselves
which
for
one
reason
or
another
he
fancies
would
prove
dangerous
or
fatal
to
the
eater
examples
of
such
abstinence
are
too
familiar
and
far
too
numerous
to
quote
but
if
the
ordinary
man
is
thus
deterred
by
superstitious
fear
from
partaking
of
various
foods
the
restraints
of
this
kind
which
are
laid
upon
sacred
or
tabooed
persons
such
as
kings
and
priests
are
still
more
numerous
and
stringent
we
have
already
seen
that
the
flamen
dialis
was
forbidden
to
eat
or
even
name
several
plants
and
animals
and
that
the
flesh
diet
of
egyptian
kings
was
restricted
to
veal
and
goose
in
antiquity
many
priests
and
many
kings
of
barbarous
peoples
abstained
wholly
from
a
flesh
diet
the
or
fetish
priests
of
the
loango
coast
are
forbidden
to
eat
or
even
see
a
variety
of
animals
and
fish
in
consequence
of
which
their
flesh
diet
is
extremely
limited
often
they
live
only
on
herbs
and
roots
though
they
may
drink
fresh
blood
the
heir
to
the
throne
of
loango
is
forbidden
from
infancy
to
eat
pork
from
early
childhood
he
is
interdicted
the
use
of
the
fruit
in
company
at
puberty
he
is
taught
by
a
priest
not
to
partake
of
fowls
except
such
as
he
has
himself
killed
and
cooked
and
so
the
number
of
taboos
goes
on
increasing
with
his
years
in
fernando
po
the
king
after
installation
is
forbidden
to
eat
deer
and
porcupine
which
are
the
ordinary
foods
of
the
people
the
head
chief
of
the
masai
may
eat
nothing
but
milk
honey
and
the
roasted
livers
of
goats
for
if
he
partook
of
any
other
food
he
would
lose
his
power
of
soothsaying
and
of
compounding
charms
the
diet
of
the
king
of
unyoro
in
central
africa
was
strictly
regulated
by
immemorial
custom
he
might
never
eat
vegetables
but
must
live
on
milk
and
beef
mutton
he
might
not
touch
the
beef
he
ate
must
be
that
of
young
animals
not
more
than
one
year
old
and
it
must
be
spitted
and
roasted
before
a
wood
fire
but
he
might
not
drink
milk
and
eat
beef
at
the
same
meal
he
drank
milk
thrice
a
day
in
the
dairy
and
the
milk
was
always
drawn
from
a
sacred
herd
which
was
kept
for
his
exclusive
use
nine
cows
neither
more
nor
less
were
daily
brought
from
pasture
to
the
royal
enclosure
to
be
milked
for
the
king
the
herding
and
the
milking
of
the
sacred
animals
were
performed
according
to
certain
rules
prescribed
by
ancient
custom
amongst
the
murrams
of
manipur
a
district
of
eastern
india
on
the
border
of
burma
there
are
many
prohibitions
in
regard
to
the
food
both
animal
and
vegetable
which
the
chief
should
eat
and
the
murrams
say
the
chief
s
post
must
be
a
very
uncomfortable
among
the
hill
tribes
of
manipur
the
scale
of
diet
allowed
by
custom
to
the
or
religious
head
of
a
village
is
always
extremely
limited
the
savoury
dog
the
tomato
the
are
forbidden
to
him
if
a
man
in
one
of
these
tribes
is
wealthy
enough
to
feast
his
whole
village
and
to
erect
a
memorial
stone
he
is
entitled
to
become
subject
to
the
same
ordinances
as
the
he
wears
the
same
special
clothes
and
for
the
space
of
a
year
at
least
he
may
not
use
a
drinking
horn
but
must
drink
from
a
bamboo
cup
among
the
karennis
or
red
karens
of
burma
a
chief
attains
his
position
not
by
hereditary
right
but
in
virtue
of
the
observance
of
taboo
he
must
abstain
from
rice
and
liquor
his
mother
too
must
have
eschewed
these
things
and
lived
only
on
yams
and
potatoes
while
she
was
with
child
during
that
time
she
might
neither
eat
meat
nor
drink
water
from
a
common
well
and
in
order
to
be
duly
qualified
for
a
chiefship
her
son
must
continue
these
habits
among
the
pshaws
and
chewsurs
of
the
caucasus
whose
nominal
christianity
has
degenerated
into
superstition
and
polytheism
there
is
an
annual
office
which
entails
a
number
of
taboos
on
the
holder
or
as
he
is
called
he
must
live
the
whole
year
in
the
temple
without
going
to
his
house
or
visiting
his
wife
indeed
he
may
not
speak
to
any
one
except
the
priests
for
fear
of
defiling
himself
once
a
week
he
must
bathe
in
the
river
whatever
the
weather
may
be
using
for
the
purpose
a
ladder
on
which
no
one
else
may
set
foot
his
only
nourishment
is
bread
and
water
in
the
temple
he
superintends
the
brewing
of
the
beer
for
the
festivals
in
the
village
of
tomil
in
yap
one
of
the
caroline
islands
the
year
consists
of
months
and
there
are
five
men
who
for
a
hundred
days
of
the
year
may
eat
only
fish
and
taro
may
not
chew
betel
and
must
observe
strict
continence
the
reason
assigned
by
them
for
submitting
to
these
restraints
is
that
if
they
did
not
act
thus
the
immature
girls
would
attain
to
puberty
too
soon
to
explain
the
ultimate
reason
why
any
particular
food
is
prohibited
to
a
whole
tribe
or
to
certain
of
its
members
would
commonly
require
a
far
more
intimate
knowledge
of
the
history
and
beliefs
of
the
tribe
than
we
possess
the
general
motive
of
such
prohibitions
is
doubtless
the
same
which
underlies
the
whole
taboo
system
namely
the
conservation
of
the
tribe
and
the
individual
knots
and
rings
tabooed
we
have
seen
that
among
the
many
taboos
which
the
flamen
dialis
at
rome
had
to
observe
there
was
one
that
forbade
him
to
have
a
knot
on
any
part
of
his
garments
and
another
that
obliged
him
to
wear
no
ring
unless
it
were
broken
in
like
manner
moslem
pilgrims
to
mecca
are
in
a
state
of
sanctity
or
taboo
and
may
wear
on
their
persons
neither
knots
nor
rings
these
rules
are
probably
of
kindred
significance
and
may
conveniently
be
considered
together
to
begin
with
knots
many
people
in
different
parts
of
the
world
entertain
a
strong
objection
to
having
any
knot
about
their
person
at
certain
critical
seasons
particularly
childbirth
marriage
and
death
thus
among
the
saxons
of
transylvania
when
a
woman
is
in
travail
all
knots
on
her
garments
are
untied
because
it
is
believed
that
this
will
facilitate
her
delivery
and
with
the
same
intention
all
the
locks
in
the
house
whether
on
doors
or
boxes
are
unlocked
the
lapps
think
that
a
woman
should
have
no
knot
on
her
garments
because
a
knot
would
have
the
effect
of
making
the
delivery
difficult
and
painful
in
ancient
india
it
was
a
rule
to
untie
all
knots
in
a
house
at
the
moment
of
childbirth
roman
religion
required
that
women
who
took
part
in
the
rites
of
juno
lucina
the
goddess
of
childbirth
should
have
no
knot
tied
on
their
persons
in
the
east
indies
this
superstition
is
extended
to
the
whole
time
of
pregnancy
the
people
believe
that
if
a
pregnant
woman
were
to
tie
knots
or
braid
or
make
anything
fast
the
child
would
thereby
be
constricted
or
the
woman
would
herself
be
tied
up
when
her
time
came
nay
some
of
them
enforce
the
observance
of
the
rule
on
the
father
as
well
as
the
mother
of
the
unborn
child
among
the
sea
dyaks
neither
of
the
parents
may
bind
up
anything
with
string
or
make
anything
fast
during
the
wife
s
pregnancy
among
the
land
dyaks
the
husband
of
the
expectant
mother
is
bound
to
refrain
from
tying
things
together
with
rattans
until
after
her
delivery
in
the
toumbuluh
tribe
of
north
celebes
a
ceremony
is
performed
in
the
fourth
or
fifth
month
of
a
woman
s
pregnancy
and
after
it
her
husband
is
forbidden
among
many
other
things
to
tie
any
fast
knots
and
to
sit
with
his
legs
crossed
over
each
other
in
the
kaitish
tribe
of
central
australia
the
father
of
a
newborn
child
goes
out
into
the
scrub
for
three
days
away
from
his
camp
leaving
his
girdle
and
behind
him
so
that
he
has
nothing
tied
tightly
round
any
part
of
his
body
this
freedom
from
constriction
is
supposed
to
benefit
his
wife
in
all
these
cases
the
idea
seems
to
be
that
the
tying
of
a
knot
would
as
they
say
in
the
east
indies
tie
up
the
woman
in
other
words
impede
and
perhaps
prevent
her
delivery
or
delay
her
convalescence
after
the
birth
on
the
principles
of
homoeopathic
or
imitative
magic
the
physical
obstacle
or
impediment
of
a
knot
on
a
cord
would
create
a
corresponding
obstacle
or
impediment
in
the
body
of
the
woman
that
this
is
really
the
explanation
of
the
rule
appears
from
a
custom
observed
by
the
hos
of
togoland
in
west
africa
at
a
difficult
birth
when
a
woman
is
in
hard
labour
and
can
not
bring
forth
they
call
in
a
magician
to
her
aid
he
looks
at
her
and
says
the
child
is
bound
in
the
womb
that
is
why
she
can
not
be
on
the
entreaties
of
her
female
relations
he
then
promises
to
loose
the
bond
so
that
she
may
bring
forth
for
that
purpose
he
orders
them
to
fetch
a
tough
creeper
from
the
forest
and
with
it
he
binds
the
hands
and
feet
of
the
sufferer
on
her
back
then
he
takes
a
knife
and
calls
out
the
woman
s
name
and
when
she
answers
he
cuts
through
the
creeper
with
a
knife
saying
i
cut
through
thy
bonds
and
thy
child
s
after
that
he
chops
up
the
creeper
small
puts
the
bits
in
a
vessel
of
water
and
bathes
the
woman
with
the
water
here
the
cutting
of
the
creeper
with
which
the
woman
s
hands
and
feet
are
bound
is
a
simple
piece
of
homoeopathic
or
imitative
magic
by
releasing
her
limbs
from
their
bonds
the
magician
imagines
that
he
simultaneously
releases
the
child
in
her
womb
from
the
trammels
which
impede
its
birth
for
a
similar
reason
no
doubt
among
the
same
people
a
priest
ties
up
the
limbs
of
a
pregnant
woman
with
grass
and
then
unties
the
knots
saying
i
will
now
open
after
that
the
woman
has
to
partake
of
some
in
which
a
ring
made
of
a
magic
cord
had
been
previously
placed
by
the
priest
the
intention
of
this
ceremony
is
probably
on
the
principles
of
homoeopathic
magic
to
ensure
for
the
woman
an
easy
delivery
by
releasing
her
from
the
bonds
of
grass
the
same
train
of
thought
underlies
a
practice
observed
by
some
peoples
of
opening
all
locks
doors
and
so
on
while
a
birth
is
taking
place
in
the
house
we
have
seen
that
at
such
a
time
the
germans
of
transylvania
open
all
the
locks
and
the
same
thing
is
done
also
in
voigtland
and
mecklenburg
in
argyllshire
superstitious
people
used
to
open
every
lock
in
the
house
at
childbirth
the
old
roman
custom
of
presenting
women
with
a
key
as
a
symbol
of
an
easy
delivery
perhaps
points
to
the
observance
of
a
similar
custom
in
the
island
of
salsette
near
bombay
when
a
woman
is
in
hard
labour
all
locks
of
doors
or
drawers
are
opened
with
a
key
to
facilitate
her
delivery
among
the
mandelings
of
sumatra
the
lids
of
all
chests
boxes
pans
and
so
forth
are
opened
and
if
this
does
not
produce
the
desired
effect
the
anxious
husband
has
to
strike
the
projecting
ends
of
some
of
the
in
order
to
loosen
them
for
they
think
that
everything
must
be
open
and
loose
to
facilitate
the
at
a
difficult
birth
the
battas
of
sumatra
make
a
search
through
the
possessions
of
husband
and
wife
and
untie
everything
that
is
tied
up
in
a
bundle
in
some
parts
of
java
when
a
woman
is
in
travail
everything
in
the
house
that
was
shut
is
opened
in
order
that
the
birth
may
not
be
impeded
not
only
are
doors
opened
and
the
lids
of
chests
boxes
and
lifted
up
but
even
swords
are
unsheathed
and
spears
drawn
out
of
their
cases
customs
of
the
same
sort
are
practised
with
the
same
intention
in
other
parts
of
the
east
indies
in
chittagong
when
a
woman
can
not
bring
her
child
to
the
birth
the
midwife
gives
orders
to
throw
all
doors
and
windows
wide
open
to
uncork
all
bottles
to
remove
the
bungs
from
all
casks
to
unloose
the
cows
in
the
stall
the
horses
in
the
stable
the
watchdog
in
his
kennel
to
set
free
sheep
fowls
ducks
and
so
forth
this
universal
liberty
accorded
to
the
animals
and
even
to
inanimate
things
is
according
to
the
people
an
infallible
means
of
ensuring
the
woman
s
delivery
and
allowing
the
babe
to
be
born
at
the
moment
of
childbirth
the
chams
of
hasten
to
open
the
stall
of
the
buffaloes
and
to
unyoke
the
plough
doubtless
with
the
intention
of
aiding
the
woman
in
travail
though
the
writer
who
reports
the
custom
is
unable
to
explain
it
among
the
singhalese
a
few
hours
before
a
birth
is
expected
to
take
place
all
the
cupboards
in
the
house
are
unlocked
with
the
express
purpose
of
facilitating
the
delivery
in
the
island
of
saghalien
when
a
woman
is
in
labour
her
husband
undoes
everything
that
can
be
undone
he
loosens
the
plaits
of
his
hair
and
the
laces
of
his
shoes
then
he
unties
whatever
is
tied
in
the
house
or
its
vicinity
in
the
courtyard
he
takes
the
axe
out
of
the
log
in
which
it
is
stuck
he
unfastens
the
boat
if
it
is
moored
to
a
tree
he
withdraws
the
cartridges
from
his
gun
and
the
arrows
from
his
crossbow
in
bilaspore
a
woman
s
hair
is
never
allowed
to
remain
knotted
while
she
is
in
the
act
of
giving
birth
to
a
child
among
some
modern
jews
of
roumania
it
is
customary
for
the
unmarried
girls
of
a
household
to
unbraid
their
hair
and
let
it
hang
loose
on
their
shoulders
while
a
woman
is
in
hard
labour
in
the
house
again
we
have
seen
that
a
toumbuluh
man
abstains
not
only
from
tying
knots
but
also
from
sitting
with
crossed
legs
during
his
wife
s
pregnancy
the
train
of
thought
is
the
same
in
both
cases
whether
you
cross
threads
in
tying
a
knot
or
only
cross
your
legs
in
sitting
at
your
ease
you
are
equally
on
the
principles
of
homoeopathic
magic
crossing
or
thwarting
the
free
course
of
things
and
your
action
can
not
but
check
and
impede
whatever
may
be
going
forward
in
your
neighbourhood
of
this
important
truth
the
romans
were
fully
aware
to
sit
beside
a
pregnant
woman
or
a
patient
under
medical
treatment
with
clasped
hands
says
the
grave
pliny
is
to
cast
a
malignant
spell
over
the
person
and
it
is
worse
still
if
you
nurse
your
leg
or
legs
with
your
clasped
hands
or
lay
one
leg
over
the
other
such
postures
were
regarded
by
the
old
romans
as
a
let
and
hindrance
to
business
of
every
sort
and
at
a
council
of
war
or
a
meeting
of
magistrates
at
prayers
and
sacrifices
no
man
was
suffered
to
cross
his
legs
or
clasp
his
hands
the
stock
instance
of
the
dreadful
consequences
that
might
flow
from
doing
one
or
the
other
was
that
of
alcmena
who
travailed
with
hercules
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights
because
the
goddess
lucina
sat
in
front
of
the
house
with
clasped
hands
and
crossed
legs
and
the
child
could
not
be
born
until
the
goddess
had
been
beguiled
into
changing
her
attitude
it
is
a
bulgarian
superstition
that
if
a
pregnant
woman
is
in
the
habit
of
sitting
with
crossed
legs
she
will
suffer
much
in
childbed
in
some
parts
of
bavaria
when
conversation
comes
to
a
standstill
and
silence
ensues
they
say
surely
somebody
has
crossed
his
the
magical
effect
of
knots
in
trammelling
and
obstructing
human
activity
was
believed
to
be
manifested
at
marriage
not
less
than
at
birth
during
the
middle
ages
and
down
to
the
eighteenth
century
it
seems
to
have
been
commonly
held
in
europe
that
the
consummation
of
marriage
could
be
prevented
by
any
one
who
while
the
wedding
ceremony
was
taking
place
either
locked
a
lock
or
tied
a
knot
in
a
cord
and
then
threw
the
lock
or
the
cord
away
the
lock
or
the
knotted
cord
had
to
be
flung
into
water
and
until
it
had
been
found
and
unlocked
or
untied
no
real
union
of
the
married
pair
was
possible
hence
it
was
a
grave
offence
not
only
to
cast
such
a
spell
but
also
to
steal
or
make
away
with
the
material
instrument
of
it
whether
lock
or
knotted
cord
in
the
year
the
parliament
of
bordeaux
sentenced
some
one
to
be
burned
alive
for
having
spread
desolation
through
a
whole
family
by
means
of
knotted
cords
and
in
two
persons
were
condemned
to
death
in
scotland
for
stealing
certain
charmed
knots
which
a
woman
had
made
in
order
thereby
to
mar
the
wedded
happiness
of
spalding
of
ashintilly
the
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
these
charms
appears
to
have
lingered
in
the
highlands
of
perthshire
down
to
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
for
at
that
time
it
was
still
customary
in
the
beautiful
parish
of
logierait
between
the
river
tummel
and
the
river
tay
to
unloose
carefully
every
knot
in
the
clothes
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
before
the
celebration
of
the
marriage
ceremony
when
the
ceremony
was
over
and
the
bridal
party
had
left
the
church
the
bridegroom
immediately
retired
one
way
with
some
young
men
to
tie
the
knots
that
had
been
loosed
a
little
before
and
the
bride
in
like
manner
withdrew
somewhere
else
to
adjust
the
disorder
of
her
dress
in
some
parts
of
the
highlands
it
was
deemed
enough
that
the
bridegroom
s
left
shoe
should
be
without
buckle
or
latchet
to
prevent
witches
from
depriving
him
on
the
nuptial
night
of
the
power
of
loosening
the
virgin
we
meet
with
the
same
superstition
and
the
same
custom
at
the
present
day
in
syria
the
persons
who
help
a
syrian
bridegroom
to
don
his
wedding
garments
take
care
that
no
knot
is
tied
on
them
and
no
button
buttoned
for
they
believe
that
a
button
buttoned
or
a
knot
tied
would
put
it
within
the
power
of
his
enemies
to
deprive
him
of
his
nuptial
rights
by
magical
means
in
lesbos
the
malignant
person
who
would
thus
injure
a
bridegroom
on
his
wedding
day
ties
a
thread
to
a
bush
while
he
utters
imprecations
but
the
bridegroom
can
defeat
the
spell
by
wearing
at
his
girdle
a
piece
of
an
old
net
or
of
an
old
mantilla
belonging
to
the
bride
in
which
knots
have
been
tied
the
fear
of
such
charms
is
diffused
all
over
north
africa
at
the
present
day
to
render
a
bridegroom
impotent
the
enchanter
has
only
to
tie
a
knot
in
a
handkerchief
which
he
had
previously
placed
quietly
on
some
part
of
the
bridegroom
s
body
when
he
was
mounted
on
horseback
ready
to
fetch
his
bride
so
long
as
the
knot
in
the
handkerchief
remains
tied
so
long
will
the
bridegroom
remain
powerless
to
consummate
the
marriage
another
way
of
effecting
the
same
object
is
to
stand
behind
the
bridegroom
when
he
is
on
horseback
with
an
open
or
pair
of
scissors
in
your
hand
and
to
call
out
his
name
if
he
imprudently
answers
you
at
once
shut
the
or
the
pair
of
scissors
with
a
snap
and
that
makes
him
impotent
to
guard
against
this
malignant
spell
the
bridegroom
s
mother
will
sometimes
buy
a
penknife
on
the
eve
of
the
marriage
shut
it
up
and
then
open
it
just
at
the
moment
when
her
son
is
about
to
enter
the
bridal
chamber
a
curious
use
is
made
of
knots
at
marriage
in
the
little
east
indian
island
of
rotti
when
a
man
has
paid
the
price
of
his
bride
a
cord
is
fastened
round
her
waist
if
she
is
a
maid
but
not
otherwise
nine
knots
are
tied
in
the
cord
and
in
order
to
make
them
harder
to
unloose
they
are
smeared
with
wax
bride
and
bridegroom
are
then
secluded
in
a
chamber
where
he
has
to
untie
the
knots
with
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
only
it
may
be
from
one
to
twelve
months
before
he
succeeds
in
undoing
them
all
until
he
has
done
so
he
may
not
look
on
the
woman
as
his
wife
in
no
case
may
the
cord
be
broken
or
the
bridegroom
would
render
himself
liable
to
any
fine
that
the
bride
s
father
might
choose
to
impose
when
all
the
knots
are
loosed
the
woman
is
his
wife
and
he
shews
the
cord
to
her
father
and
generally
presents
his
wife
with
a
golden
or
silver
necklace
instead
of
the
cord
the
meaning
of
this
custom
is
not
clear
but
we
may
conjecture
that
the
nine
knots
refer
to
the
nine
months
of
pregnancy
and
that
miscarriage
would
be
the
supposed
result
of
leaving
a
single
knot
untied
the
maleficent
power
of
knots
may
also
be
manifested
in
the
infliction
of
sickness
disease
and
all
kinds
of
misfortune
thus
among
the
hos
of
togoland
a
sorcerer
will
sometimes
curse
his
enemy
and
tie
a
knot
in
a
stalk
of
grass
saying
i
have
tied
up
in
this
knot
may
all
evil
light
upon
him
when
he
goes
into
the
field
may
a
snake
sting
him
when
he
goes
to
the
chase
may
a
ravening
beast
attack
him
and
when
he
steps
into
a
river
may
the
water
sweep
him
away
when
it
rains
may
the
lightning
strike
him
may
evil
nights
be
his
it
is
believed
that
in
the
knot
the
sorcerer
has
bound
up
the
life
of
his
enemy
babylonian
witches
and
wizards
of
old
used
to
strangle
their
victim
seal
his
mouth
wrack
his
limbs
and
tear
his
entrails
by
merely
tying
knots
in
a
cord
while
at
each
knot
they
muttered
a
spell
but
happily
the
evil
could
be
undone
by
simply
undoing
the
knots
we
hear
of
a
man
in
one
of
the
orkney
islands
who
was
utterly
ruined
by
nine
knots
cast
on
a
blue
thread
and
it
would
seem
that
sick
people
in
scotland
sometimes
prayed
to
the
devil
to
restore
them
to
health
by
loosing
the
secret
knot
that
was
doing
all
the
mischief
in
the
koran
there
is
an
allusion
to
the
mischief
of
those
who
puff
into
the
knots
and
an
arab
commentator
on
the
passage
explains
that
the
words
refer
to
women
who
practise
magic
by
tying
knots
in
cords
and
then
blowing
and
spitting
upon
them
he
goes
on
to
relate
how
once
upon
a
time
a
wicked
jew
bewitched
the
prophet
mohammed
himself
by
tying
nine
knots
on
a
string
which
he
then
hid
in
a
well
so
the
prophet
fell
ill
and
nobody
knows
what
might
have
happened
if
the
archangel
gabriel
had
not
opportunely
revealed
to
the
holy
man
the
place
where
the
knotted
cord
was
concealed
the
trusty
ali
soon
fetched
the
baleful
thing
from
the
well
and
the
prophet
recited
over
it
certain
charms
which
were
specially
revealed
to
him
for
the
purpose
at
every
verse
of
the
charms
a
knot
untied
itself
and
the
prophet
experienced
a
certain
relief
it
will
hardly
be
disputed
that
by
tying
knots
on
the
string
the
pestilent
hebrew
contrived
if
i
may
say
so
to
constrict
or
astringe
or
in
short
to
tie
up
some
vital
organ
or
organs
in
the
prophet
s
stomach
at
least
we
are
informed
that
something
of
this
sort
is
done
by
australian
blackfellows
at
the
present
day
and
if
so
why
should
it
not
have
been
done
by
arabs
in
the
time
of
mohammed
the
australian
mode
of
operation
is
as
follows
when
a
blackfellow
wishes
to
settle
old
scores
with
another
blackfellow
he
ties
a
rope
of
fibre
or
bark
so
tightly
round
the
neck
of
his
slumbering
friend
as
partially
to
choke
him
having
done
this
he
takes
out
the
man
s
from
under
his
short
rib
ties
up
his
inside
carefully
with
string
replaces
the
skin
and
having
effaced
all
external
marks
of
the
wound
makes
off
with
the
stolen
fat
the
victim
on
awakening
feels
no
inconvenience
but
sooner
or
later
sometimes
months
afterwards
while
he
is
hunting
or
exerting
himself
violently
in
some
other
way
he
will
feel
the
string
snap
in
his
inside
hallo
says
he
somebody
has
tied
me
up
inside
with
string
and
he
goes
home
to
the
camp
and
dies
on
the
spot
who
can
doubt
but
that
in
this
lucid
diagnosis
we
have
the
true
key
to
the
prophet
s
malady
and
that
he
too
might
have
succumbed
to
the
wiles
of
his
insidious
foe
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
timely
intervention
of
the
archangel
gabriel
if
knots
are
supposed
to
kill
they
are
also
supposed
to
cure
this
follows
from
the
belief
that
to
undo
the
knots
which
are
causing
sickness
will
bring
the
sufferer
relief
but
apart
from
this
negative
virtue
of
maleficent
knots
there
are
certain
beneficent
knots
to
which
a
positive
power
of
healing
is
ascribed
pliny
tells
us
that
some
folk
cured
diseases
of
the
groin
by
taking
a
thread
from
a
web
tying
seven
or
nine
knots
on
it
and
then
fastening
it
to
the
patient
s
groin
but
to
make
the
cure
effectual
it
was
necessary
to
name
some
widow
as
each
knot
was
tied
the
ancient
assyrians
seem
to
have
made
much
use
of
knotted
cords
as
a
remedy
for
ailments
and
disease
the
cord
with
its
knots
which
were
sometimes
twice
seven
in
number
was
tied
round
the
head
neck
or
limbs
of
the
patient
and
then
after
a
time
cut
off
and
thrown
away
carrying
with
it
as
was
apparently
supposed
the
aches
and
pains
of
the
sufferer
sometimes
the
magic
cord
which
was
used
for
this
beneficent
purpose
consisted
of
a
double
strand
of
black
and
white
wool
sometimes
it
was
woven
of
the
hair
of
a
virgin
kid
a
modern
arab
cure
for
fever
reported
from
the
ruins
of
nineveh
is
to
tie
a
cotton
thread
with
seven
knots
on
it
round
the
wrist
of
the
patient
who
must
wear
it
for
seven
or
eight
days
or
till
such
time
as
the
fever
passes
after
which
he
may
throw
it
away
o
donovan
describes
a
similar
remedy
for
fever
employed
among
the
turcomans
the
enchanter
takes
some
camel
hair
and
spins
it
into
a
stout
thread
droning
a
spell
the
while
next
he
ties
seven
knots
on
the
thread
blowing
on
each
knot
before
he
pulls
it
tight
this
knotted
thread
is
then
worn
as
a
bracelet
on
his
wrist
by
the
patient
every
day
one
of
the
knots
is
untied
and
blown
upon
and
when
the
seventh
knot
is
undone
the
whole
thread
is
rolled
up
into
a
ball
and
thrown
into
a
river
bearing
away
as
they
imagine
the
fever
with
it
the
hos

in
like
manner
tie
strings
round
a
sick
man
s
neck
arms
or
legs
according
to
the
nature
of
the
malady
some
of
the
strings
are
intended
to
guard
him
against
the
influence
of
the
evil
mouth
others
are
a
protection
against
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
in
argyleshire
threads
with
three
knots
on
them
are
still
used
to
cure
the
internal
ailments
of

and
beast
the
witch

the
sick
person
or
cow
with
the
knotted
thread

two
of
the
knots
in
the
fire
saying
i
put
the
disease
and
the
sickness
on
the
top
of
the
fire
and
ties
the
rest
of
the
thread
with
the
single
knot
round
the
neck
of
the
person
or
the
tail
of
the
cow
but
always
so
that
it
may
not
be
seen
a
scotch
cure
for
a
sprained
leg
or
arm
is
to
cast
nine
knots
in
a
black
thread
and
then
tie
the
thread
round
the
suffering
limb
while
you

if
a

takes
seven

threads
goes
to
a
place
where
an
owl
is
hooting

ties
a
knot
at
each
hoot
and
fastens
the
knotted
thread
round
the
right
arm
of
a
man
sick
of
the
fever
the
malady
will
leave
him
again
knots
may
be
used
by
an
enchantress
to
win
a
lover
and
attach
him
firmly
to
herself
thus
the
maid
in
virgil
seeks
to
draw
daphnis
to
her
from
the
city
by
spells
and
by
tying
three
knots
on
each
of
three
strings
of
different
colours
so
an
arab
maiden
who
had
lost
her
heart
to
a
certain
man
tried
to
gain
his
love
and
bind
him
to
herself
by
tying
knots
in
his
whip
but
her
jealous
rival
undid
the
knots
on
the
same
principle
magic
knots
may
be
employed
to
stop
a
runaway
in
swazieland
you
may
often
see
grass
tied
in
knots
at
the
side
of
the
footpaths
every
one
of
these
knots
tells
of
a
domestic
tragedy
a
wife
has
run
away
from
her
husband
and
he
and
his
friends
have
gone
in
pursuit
binding
up
the
paths
as
they
call
it
in
this
fashion
to
prevent
the
fugitive
from
doubling
back
over
them
when
a
swaheli
wishes
to
capture
a
runaway
slave
he
will
sometimes
take
a
string
of
fibre
to
a
wise
man
and
get
him
to
recite
a
passage
of
the
koran
seven
times
over
it
while
at
each
reading
the
wizard
ties
a
knot
in
the
string
then
the
armed
with
the
knotted
string
takes
his
stand
in
the
door
of
the
house
and
calls
on
his
slave
seven
times
by
name
after
which
he
hangs
the
string
over
the
door
the
obstructive
power
of
knots
and
locks
as
means
of
barring
out
evil
manifests
itself
in
many
ways
thus
on
the
principle
that
prevention
is
better
than
cure
zulu
hunters
immediately
tie
a
knot
in
the
tail
of
any
animal
they
have
killed
because
they
believe
that
this
will
hinder
the
meat
from
giving
them
pains
in
their
stomachs
an
ancient
hindoo
book
recommends
that
travellers
on
a
dangerous
road
should
tie
knots
in
the
skirts
of
their
garments
for
this
will
cause
their
journey
to
prosper
similarly
among
some
caffre
tribes
when
a
man
is
going
on
a
doubtful
journey
he
knots
a
few
blades
of
grass
together
that
the
journey
may
turn
out
well
in
laos
hunters
fancy
that
they
can
throw
a
spell
over
a
forest
so
as
to
prevent
any
one
else
from
hunting
there
successfully
having
killed
game
of
any
kind
they
utter
certain
magical
words
while
they
knot
together
some
stalks
of
grass
adding
as
i
knot
this
grass
so
let
no
hunter
be
lucky
the
virtue
of
this
spell
will
last
as
usually
happens
in
such
cases
so
long
as
the
stalks
remain
knotted
together
the
yabims
of
german
new
guinea
lay
a
knot
in
a
that
is
not
ready
for
sea
in
order
that
a
certain
being
called
balum
may
not
embark
in
it
for
he
has
the
power
of
taking
away
the
fish
and
weighing
down

amulets
often
derive
their
protective
virtue
in
great
measure
from
knots
here
for
example
is
a
spell
which
will
warrant
its
employer
against
all
risk
of
being

that

the
mighty
strength
of
the
a
net
from
its
affluence
of
knots
has
always
been
considered
in
russia
very
efficacious
against
sorcerers
hence
in
some
places
when
a
bride
is
being
dressed
in
her
wedding
attire
a
is
flung
over
her
to
keep
her
out
of
harm
s

for
a
similar
purpose
the
bridegroom
and
his
companions
are
often
girt
with
pieces
of
net
or
at
least
with
girdles
for
before
a
wizard
can
begin
to
injure
them
he
must
undo
all
the
knots
in
the
net
or
take
off
the
girdles
but
often
a
russian
amulet
is
merely
a
knotted
thread
a
skein
of
red
wool
wound
about

arms
and
legs
is
thought
to
ward
off
agues
and

deemed
a
preservative
against

thrice
round

the
mouths
of

the

to
lock
up

the
bulgarians
have
a
similar
mode
of
guarding
their
cattle
against
wild
beasts
a

takes
a
needle
and

after
dark
and
sews
together
the
skirt
of

a

asks
her
what
she

she
tells
him
that
she
is

eyes
and
jaws
of
the
wolves
so
that
they
may
not
hear
see
or
bite

pigs
similarly
in
antiquity
a
witch
fancied
that
she
could
shut
the
mouths
of
her
enemies
by
sewing
up
the
mouth
of
a
fish
with
a
bronze
needle
and
farmers
attempted
to
ward
off
hail
from
their
crops
by
tying

the
armenians
essay
to
lock
the
jaws
of
wolves
by
uttering
a
spell
tying
seven
knots
in
a
and
placing
the

between
the
teeth
of
a
which
are
probably
taken
to
represent
the

to
guard
them
against
those
evil
influences
to
which
at
this
crisis
of
life
they
are
especially
exposed
the
following
mode
of
keeping
an
epidemic
from
a
village
is
known
to
have
been
practised
among
the
balkan
slavs
two
old
women
proceed
to
a
spot
outside
the
village
the
one
with
a
copper
kettle
full
of
water
the
other
with
a
and
key
the
old
dame
with
the
kettle
asks
the
other
whither
away
the
one
with
the
lock
answers
i
came
to
lock
the
village
against
mishap
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
words
she
locks
the
lock
and
throws
it
together
with
the
key
into
the
kettle
of
water
then
she
strides
thrice
round
the
village
each
time
repeating
the
performance
with
the
lock
and
kettle
to
this
day
a
transylvanian
sower
thinks
he
can
keep
birds
from
the
corn
by
carrying
a
lock
in
the
such
magical
uses
of
locks
and
keys
are
clearly
parallel
to
the
magical
use
of
knots
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
in
ceylon
the
singhalese
observe
a
curious
custom
of
the
called
goigote
tying
of
the
cultivator
s
knot
when
a
sheaf
of
corn
has
been
threshed
out
before
it
is
removed
the
grain
is
heaped
up
and
the
threshers
generally
six
in
number
sit
round
it
and
taking
a
few
stalks
with
the
ears
of
corn
attached
jointly
tie
a
knot
and
bury
it
in
the
heap
it
is
left
there
until
all
the
sheaves
have
been
threshed
and
the
corn
winnowed
and
measured
the
object
of
this
ceremony
is
to
prevent
the
devils
from
diminishing
the
quantity
of
corn
in
the
knots
and
locks
may
serve
to
avert
not
only
devils
but
death
itself
when
they
brought
a
woman
to
the
stake
at
andrews
in
to
burn
her
alive
for
a
witch
they
found
on
her
a
white
cloth
like
a
collar
with
strings
and
many
knots
on
the
strings
they
took
it
from
her
sorely
against
her
will
for
she
seemed
to
think
that
she
could
not
die
in
the
fire
if
only
the
cloth
with
the
knotted
strings
was
on
her
when
it
was
taken
away
she
said
now
i
have
no
hope
of
in
many
parts
of
england
it
is
thought
that
a
person
can
not
die
so
long
as
any
locks
are
locked
or
bolts
shot
in
the
house
it
is
therefore
a
very
common
practice
to
undo
all
locks
and
bolts
when
the
sufferer
is
plainly
near
his
end
in
order
that
his
agony
may
not
be
unduly
prolonged
for
example
in
the
year
at
taunton
a
child
lay
sick
of
scarlatina
and
death
seemed
inevitable
a
jury
of
matrons
was
as
it
were
empanelled
and
to
prevent
the
child
dying
hard
all
the
doors
in
the
house
all
the
drawers
all
the
boxes
all
the
cupboards
were
thrown
wide
open
the
keys
taken
out
and
the
body
of
the
child
placed
under
a
beam
whereby
a
sure
certain
and
easy
passage
into
eternity
could
be
strange
to
say
the
child
declined
to
avail
itself
of
the
facilities
for
dying
so
obligingly
placed
at
its
disposal
by
the
sagacity
and
experience
of
the
british
matrons
of
taunton
it
preferred
to
live
rather
than
give
up
the
ghost
just
then
a
masai
man
whose
sons
have
gone
out
to

will
take
a
hair
and
tie
a
knot
in
it
for
each
of
his
absent
sons
praying
god
to
keep
their
bodies
and
souls
as
firmly
fastened
together
as
these
knots
the
precise
mode
in
which
the
virtue
of
the
knot
is
supposed
to
take
effect
in
some
of
these
instances
does
not
clearly
appear
but
in
general
we
may
say
that
in
all
the
cases
we
have
been
considering
the
leading
characteristic
of
the
magic
knot
or
lock
is
that
in
strict
accordance
with
its
physical
nature
it
always
acts
as
an
impediment
hindrance
or
obstacle
and
that
its
influence
is
maleficent
or
beneficent
according
as
the
thing
which
it
impedes
or
hinders
is
good
or
evil
the
obstructive
tendency
attributed
to
the
knot
in
spiritual
matters
appears
in
a
swiss
superstition
that
if
in
sewing
a
corpse
into
its
shroud
you
make
a
knot
on
the
thread
it
will
hinder
the
soul
of
the
deceased
on
its
passage
to
eternity
in
coffining
a
corpse
the
highlanders
of
scotland
used
to
untie
or
cut
every
string
in
the
shroud
else
the
spirit
could
not
rest
the
germans
of
transylvania
place
a
little
pillow
with
the
dead
in
the
coffin
but
in
sewing
it
they
take
great
care
not
to
make
any
knot
on
the
thread
for
they
say
that
to
do
so
would
hinder
the
dead
man
from
resting
in
the
grave
and
his
widow
from
marrying
again
among
the
pidhireanes
a
ruthenian
people
on
the
hem
of
the
carpathians
when
a
widow
wishes
to
marry
again
soon
she
unties
the
knots
on
her
dead
husband
s
before
the
coffin
is
shut
down
on
him
this
removes
all
impediments
to
her
future
marriage
a
nandi
who
is
starting
on
a
journey
will
tie
a
knot
in
grass
by
the
wayside
as
he
believes
that
by
so
doing
he
will
prevent
the
people
whom
he
is
going
to
visit
from
taking
their
meal
till
he
arrives
or
at
all
events
he
will
ensure
that
they
leave
enough
food
over
for
him
the
rule
which
prescribes
that
at
certain
magical
and
religious
ceremonies
the
hair
should
hang
loose
and
the
feet
should
be
bare
is
probably
based
on
the
same
fear
of
trammelling
and
impeding
the
action
in
hand
whatever
it
may
be
by
the
presence
of
any
knot
or
constriction
whether
on
the
head
or
on
the
feet
of
the
performer
this
connexion
of
ideas
comes
out
clearly
in
a
passage
of
ovid
who
bids
a
pregnant
woman
loosen
her
hair
before
she
prays
to
the
goddess
of
childbirth
in
order
that
the
goddess
may
gently
loose
her
teeming
womb
it
is
less
easy
to
say
why
on
certain
solemn
occasions
it
appears
to
have
been
customary
with
some
people
to
go
with
one
shoe
off
and
one
shoe
on
the
forlorn
hope
of
two
hundred
men
who
on
a
dark
and
stormy
night
stole
out
of
plataea
broke
through
the
lines
of
the
besieging
spartans
and
escaped
from
the
doomed
city
were
shod
on
the
left
foot
only
the
historian
who
records
the
fact
assumes
that
the
intention
was
to
prevent
their
feet
from
slipping
in
the
mud
but
if
so
why
were
not
both
feet
unshod
or
shod
what
is
good
for
the
one
foot
is
surely
good
for
the
other
the
peculiar
attire
of
the
plataeans
on
this
occasion
had
probably
nothing
to
do
with
the
particular
state
of
the
ground
and
the
weather
at
the
time
when
they
made
their
desperate
sally
but
was
an
old
custom
a
form
of
consecration
or
devotion
observed
by
men
in
any
great
hazard
or
grave
emergency
certainly
the
costume
appears
to
have
been
regularly
worn
by
some
fighting
races
in
antiquity
at
least
when
they
went
forth
to
battle
thus
we
are
told
that
all
the
aetolians
were
shod
only
on
one
foot
because
they
were
so
warlike
and
virgil
represents
some
of
the
rustic
militia
of
ancient
latium
as
marching
to
war
their
right
feet
shod
in
boots
of
raw
hide
while
their
left
feet
were
bare
an
oracle
warned
pelias
king
of
iolcus
to
beware
of
the
man
with
one
sandal
and
when
jason
arrived
with
a
sandal
on
his
right
foot
but
with
his
left
foot
bare
the
king
recognised
the
hand
of
fate
the
common
story
that
jason
had
lost
one
of
his
sandals
in
fording
a
river
was
probably
invented
when
the
real
motive
of
the
costume
was
forgotten
again
according
to
one
legend
perseus
seems
to
have
worn
only
one
shoe
when
he
went
on
his
perilous
enterprise
to
cut
off
the
gorgon
s
head
in
certain
forms
of
purification
greek
ritual
appears
to
have
required
that
the
person
to
be
cleansed
should
wear
a
rough
shoe
on
one
foot
while
the
other
was
unshod
the
rule
is
not
mentioned
by
ancient
writers
but
may
be
inferred
from
a
scene
painted
on
a
greek
vase
where
a
man
naked
except
for
a
fillet
round
his
head
is
seen
crouching
on
the
skin
of
a
sacrificial
victim
his
bare
right
foot
resting
on
the
skin
while
his
left
foot
shod
in
a
rough
boot
is
planted
on
the
ground
in
front
of
him
round
about
women
with
torches
and
vessels
are
engaged
in
performing
ceremonies
of
purification
over
him
when
dido
in
virgil
deserted
by
aeneas
has
resolved
to
die
she
feigns
to
perform
certain
magical
rites
which
will
either
win
back
her
false
lover
or
bring
relief
to
her
wounded
heart
in
appealing
to
the
gods
and
the
stars
she
stands
by
the
altar
with
her
dress
loosened
and
with
one
foot
bare
among
the
heathen
arabs
the
cursing
of
an
enemy
was
a
public
act
the
maledictions
were
often
couched
in
the
form
of
a
satirical
poem
which
the
poet
himself
recited
with
certain
solemn
formalities
thus
when
the
young
lebid
appeared
at
the
court
of
norman
to
denounce
the
absites
he
anointed
the
hair
of
his
head
on
one
side
only
let
his
garment
hang
down
loosely
and
wore
but
one
shoe
this
we
are
told
was
the
costume
regularly
adopted
by
certain
poets
on
such
occasions
thus
various
peoples
seem
to
be
of
opinion
that
it
stands
a
man
in
good
stead
to
go
with
one
foot
shod
and
one
foot
bare
on
certain
momentous
occasions
but
why
the
explanation
must
apparently
be
sought
in
the
magical
virtue
attributed
to
knots
for
down
to
recent
times
we
may
take
it
shoes
have
been
universally
tied
to
the
feet
by
latchets
now
the
magical
action
of
a
knot
as
we
have
seen
is
supposed
to
be
to
bind
and
restrain
not
merely
the
body
but
the
soul
and
this
action
is
beneficial
or
harmful
according
as
the
thing
which
is
bound
and
restrained
is
evil
or
good
it
is
a
necessary
corollary
of
this
doctrine
that
to
be
without
knots
is
to
be
free
and
untrammelled
which
by
the
way
may
be
the
reason
why
the
augur
s
staff
at
rome
had
to
be
made
from
a
piece
of
wood
in
which
there
was
no
knot
it
would
never
do
for
a
divining
rod
to
be
hence
we
may
suppose
that
the
intention
of
going
with
one
shoe
on
and
one
shoe
off
is
both
to
restrain
and
to
set
at
liberty
to
bind
and
to
unbind
but
to
bind
or
unbind
whom
or
what
perhaps
the
notion
is
to
rid
the
man
himself
of
magical
restraint
but
to
lay
it
on
his
foe
or
at
all
events
on
his
foe
s
magic
in
short
to
bind
his
enemy
by
a
spell
while
he
himself
goes
free
this
is
substantially
the
explanation
which
the
acute
and
learned
servius
gives
of
dido
s
costume
he
says
that
she
went
with
one
shoe
on
and
one
shoe
off
in
order
that
aeneas
might
be
entangled
and
herself
released
an
analogous
explanation
would
obviously
apply
to
all
the
other
cases
we
have
considered
for
in
all
of
them
the
man
who
wears
this
peculiar
costume
is
confronted
with
hostile
powers
whether
human
or
supernatural
which
it
must
be
his
object
to
lay
under
a
ban
a
similar
power
to
bind
and
hamper
spiritual
as
well
as
bodily
activities
is
ascribed
by
some
people
to
rings
thus
in
the
greek
island
of
carpathus
people
never
button
the
clothes
they
put
upon
a
dead
body
and
they
are
careful
to
remove
all
rings
from
it
for
the
spirit
they
say
can
even
be
detained
in
the
little
finger
and
can
not
here
it
is
plain
that
even
if
the
soul
is
not
definitely
supposed
to
issue
at
death
from
the
yet
the
ring
is
conceived
to
exercise
a
certain
constrictive
influence
which
detains
and
imprisons
the
immortal
spirit
in
spite
of
its
efforts
to
escape
from
the
tabernacle
of
clay
in
short
the
ring
like
the
knot
acts
as
a
spiritual
fetter
this
may
have
been
the
reason
of
an
ancient
greek
maxim
attributed
to
pythagoras
which
forbade
people
to
wear
rings
nobody
might
enter
the
ancient
arcadian
sanctuary
of
the
mistress
at
lycosura
with
a
ring
on
his
or
her
finger
persons
who
consulted
the
oracle
of
faunus
had
to
be
chaste
to
eat
no
flesh
and
to
wear
no
rings
on
the
other
hand
the
same
constriction
which
hinders
the
egress
of
the
soul
may
prevent
the
entrance
of
evil
spirits
hence
we
find
rings
used
as
amulets
against
demons
witches
and
ghosts
in
the
tyrol
it
is
said
that
a
woman
in
childbed
should
never
take
off
her
or
spirits
and
witches
will
have
power
over
her
among
the
lapps
the
person
who
is
about
to
place
a
corpse
in
the
coffin
receives
from
the
husband
wife
or
children
of
the
deceased
a
brass
ring
which
he
must
wear
fastened
to
his
right
arm
until
the
corpse
is
safely
deposited
in
the
grave
the
ring
is
believed
to
serve
the
person
as
an
amulet
against
any
harm
which
the
ghost
might
do
to
him

the
carpathians

iron
rings
are
often
worn
as
an
amulet
against
disease
or
to
counteract
the
malignant
influence
of
the

a

ring
is
used
in
gujarat
to

off

baleful
influence

touch

copper
ring

of

masai
men
also
wear
on

middle
finger
of
the
right
hand
a
ring
made
out
of
the
hide
of
a
sacrificial
victim
it
is
supposed
to
protect
the
wearer
from
witchcraft
and
disease
of
every
kind
we
have
seen
that
magic
cords
are
fastened
round
the
wrists
of
siamese
children
to
keep
off
evil
spirits
that
some
people
tie
strings
round
the
wrists
of
women
in
childbed
of
convalescents
after
sickness
and
of
mourners
after
a
funeral
in
order
to
prevent
the
escape
of
their
souls
at
these
critical
seasons
and
that
with
the
same
intention
the
bagobos
put
brass
rings
on
the
wrists
or
ankles
of
the
sick
this
use
of
bracelets
and
anklets
as
amulets
to
keep
the
soul
in
the
body
is
exactly
parallel
to
the
use
of
which
we
are
here
considering
the
placing
of
these
spiritual
fetters
on
the
wrists
is
especially
appropriate
because
some
people
fancy
that
a
soul
resides
wherever
a
pulse
is
felt
beating
how
far
the
custom
of
wearing
bracelets
and
anklets
may
have
been
influenced
by
or
even
have
sprung
from
a
belief
in
their
efficacy
as
amulets
to
keep
the
soul
in
the
body
or
demons
out
of
it
is
a
question
which
seems
worth
considering
here
we
are
only
concerned
with
the
belief
in
so
far
as
it
seems
to
throw
light
on
the
rule
that
the
flamen
dialis
might
not
wear
a
ring
unless
it
were
broken
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
rule
which
forbade
him
to
have
a
knot
on
his
garments
it
points
to
a
fear
that
the
powerful
spirit
embodied
in
him
might
be
trammelled
and
hampered
in
its
and
by
such
corporeal
and
spiritual
fetters
as
rings
and
knots
the
same
fear
probably
dictated
the
rule
that
if
a
man
in
bonds
were
taken
into
the
house
of
the
flamen
dialis
the
captive
was
to
be
unbound
and
the
cords
to
be
drawn
up
through
a
hole
in
the
roof
and
so
let
down
into
the
street
further
we
may
conjecture
that
the
custom
of
releasing
prisoners
at
a
festival
may
have
originated
in
the
same
train
of
thought
it
might
be
imagined
that
their
fetters
would
impede
the
flow
of
the
divine
grace
the
custom
was
observed
at
the
greek
festival
of
the
thesmophoria
and
at
the
athenian
festival
of
dionysus
in
the
city
at
the
great
festival
of
the
dassera
celebrated
in
october
by
the
goorkhas
of
nepaul
all
the
law
courts
are
closed
and
all
prisoners
in
gaol
are
removed
from
the
precincts
of
the
city
but
those
who
are
imprisoned
outside
the
city
do
not
have
to
change
their
place
of
confinement
at
the
time
of
the
dassera
this
nepaulese
custom
appears
strongly
to
support
the
explanation
here
suggested
of
such
for
observe
that
the
prisoners
are
not
released
but
merely
removed
from
the
city
the
intention
is
therefore
not
to
allow
them
to
share
the
general
happiness
but
merely
to
rid
the
city
of
their
inopportune
presence
at
the
festival
before
quitting
the
subject
of
knots
i
may
be
allowed
to
hazard
a
conjecture
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
famous
gordian
knot
which
alexander
the
great
failing
in
his
efforts
to
untie
it
cut
through
with
his
sword
in
gordium
the
ancient
capital
of
the
kings
of
phrygia
there
was
preserved
a
waggon
of
which
the
yoke
was
fastened
to
the
pole
by
a
strip
of
or
a
twisted
and
tied
in
an
intricate
knot
tradition
ran
that
the
waggon
had
been
dedicated
by
midas
the
first
king
of
the
dynasty
and
that
whoever
untied
the
knot
would
be
ruler
of
asia
perhaps
the
knot
was
a
talisman
with
which
the
fate
of
the
dynasty
was
believed
to
be
bound
up
in
such
a
way
that
whenever
the
knot
was
loosed
the
reign
of
the
dynasty
would
come
to
an
end
we
have
seen
that
the
magic
virtue
ascribed
to
knots
is
naturally
enough
supposed
to
last
only
so
long
as
they
remain
untied
if
the
gordian
knot
was
the
talisman
of
the
phrygian
kings
the
local
fame
it
enjoyed
as
guaranteeing
to
them
the
rule
of
phrygia
might
easily
be
exaggerated
by
distant
rumour
into
a
report
that
the
sceptre
of
asia
itself
would
fall
to
him
who
should
undo
the
wondrous
knot
chapter
vi
tabooed

unable
to
discriminate
clearly
between

and

the
savage
commonly
fancies
that
the
link
between
a
name
and
the
person
or
thing
denominated
by
it
is
not
a
mere
arbitrary
and
ideal
association
but
a
real
and
substantial
bond
which
unites
the
two
in
such
a
way
that
magic
may
be
wrought
on
a
man
just
as
easily
through
his
name
as
through
his
hair
his
nails
or
any
other
material
part
of
his
person
in
fact
primitive
man
regards
his
name
as
a
vital
portion
of
himself
and
takes
care
of
it
accordingly
thus
for
example
the
north
american
indian
regards
his
name
not
as
a
mere
label
but
as
a
distinct
part
of
his
personality
just
as
much
as
are
his
eyes
or
his
teeth
and
believes
that
injury
will
result
as
surely
from
the
malicious
handling
of
his
name
as
from
a
wound
inflicted
on
any
part
of
his
physical
organism
this
belief
was
found
among
the
various
tribes
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
and
has
occasioned
a
number
of
curious
regulations
in

to
the
concealment
and
change
of
names
it
may
be
on
this
account
that
both
powhatan
and
pocahontas
are
known
in
history
under
assumed
appellations
their
true
names
having
been
concealed
from
the
whites
until
the
pseudonyms
were
too
firmly
established
to
be
supplanted
should
his
prayers
have
no
apparent
effect
when
treating
a
patient
for
some
serious
illness
the
shaman
sometimes
concludes
that
the
name
is
affected
and
accordingly
goes
to
water
with
appropriate
ceremonies
and
christens
the
patient
with
a
new
name
by
which
he
is
henceforth
to
be
known
he
then
begins
afresh
repeating
the
formulas
with
the
new
name
selected
for
the
patient
in
the
confident
hope
that
his
efforts
will
be
crowned
with
some
esquimaux
take
new
names
when
they
are
old
hoping
thereby
to
get
a
new
lease
of
life
the
tolampoos
of
central
celebes
believe
that
if
you
write
a
man
s
name
down
you
can
carry
off
his
soul
along
with
it
on
that
account
the
headman
of
a
village
appeared
uneasy
when
kruijt
wrote
down
his
name
he
entreated
the
missionary
to
erase
it
and
was
only
reassured
on
being
told
that
it
was
not
his
real
name
but
merely
his
second
name
that
had
been
put
on
paper
again
when
the
same
missionary
took
down
the
names
of
villages
from
the
lips
of
a
woman
she
asked
him
anxiously
if
he
would
not
thereby
take
away
the
soul
of
the
villages
and
so
cause
the
inhabitants
to
fall
sick
if
we
may
judge
from
the
evidence
of
language
this
crude
conception
of
the
relation
of
names
to
persons
was
widely
prevalent
if
not
universal
among
the
forefathers
of
the
aryan
race
for
an
analysis
of
the
words
for
name
in
the
various
languages
of
that
great
family
of
speech
points
to
the
conclusion
that
the
celts
and
certain
other
widely
separated
aryans
unless
we
should
rather
say
the
whole
aryan
family
believed
at
one
time
not
only
that
the
name
was
a
part
of
the
man
but
that
it
was
that
part
of
him
which
is
termed
the
soul
the
breath
of
life
or
whatever
you
may
choose
to
define
it
as
however
this
may
have
been
among
the
primitive
aryans
it
is
quite
certain
that
many
savages
at
the
present
day
regard
their
names
as
vital
parts
of
themselves
and
therefore
take
great
pains
to
conceal
their
real
names
lest
these
should
give
to
persons
a
handle
by
which
to
injure
their
owners
thus
to
begin
with
the
savages
who
rank
at
the
bottom
of
the
social
scale
we
are
told
that
the
secrecy
with
which
among
the
australian
aborigines
personal
names
are
often
kept
from
general
knowledge
arises
in
great
measure
from
the
belief
that
an
enemy
who
knows
your
name
has
in
it
something
which
he
can
use
magically
to
your
an
australian
black
says
another
writer
is
always
very
unwilling
to
tell
his
real
name
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
reluctance
is
due
to
the
fear
that
through
his
name
he
may
be
injured
by
on
herbert
river
in
queensland
the
wizards
in
order
to
practise
their
arts
against
some
one
need
only
to
know
the
name
of
the
person
in
question
and
for
this
reason
they
rarely
use
their
proper
names
in
addressing
or
speaking
of
each
other
but
simply
their
class
in
the
tribes
of
australia
when
the
new
name
is
given
at
initiation
the
child
s
name
becomes
secret
not
to
be
revealed
to
strangers
or
to
be
mentioned
by
friends
the
reason
appears
to
be
that
a
name
is
part
of
a
person
and
therefore
can
be
made
use
of
to
that
person
s
detriment
by
any
who
wish
to
catch
him
by
evil
thus
among
the
yuin
of
new
south
wales
the
totem
name
is
said
to
have
been
something
magical
rather
than
a
mere
name
in
our
sense
and
it
was
kept
secret
lest
an
enemy
should
injure
its
bearer
by
sorcery
the
name
was
revealed
to
a
youth
by
his
father
at
initiation
but
very
few
other
people
knew
it
another
writer
who
knew
the
australians
well
observes
that
in
many
tribes
the
belief
prevails
that
the
life
of
an
enemy
may
be
taken
by
the
use
of
his
name
in
incantations
the
consequence
of
this
idea
is
that
in
the
tribes
in
which
it
obtains
the
name
of
the
male
is
given
up
for
ever
at
the
time
when
he
undergoes
the
first
of
a
series
of
ceremonies
which
end
in
conferring
the
rights
of
manhood
in
such
tribes
a
man
has
no
name
and
when
a
man
desires
to
attract
the
attention
of
any
male
of
his
tribe
who
is
out
of
his
boyhood
instead
of
calling
him
by
name
he
addresses
him
as
brother
nephew
or
cousin
as
the
case
may
be
or
by
the
name
of
the
class
to
which
he
belongs
i
used
to
notice
when
i
lived
amongst
the
bangerang
that
the
names
which
the
males
bore
in
infancy
were
soon
almost
forgotten
by
the
it
may
be
questioned
however
whether
the
writer
whom
i
have
just
quoted
was
not
deceived
in
thinking
that
among
these
tribes
men
gave
up
their
individual
names
on
passing
through
the
ceremony
of
initiation
into
manhood
it
is
more
in
harmony
with
savage
beliefs
and
practices
to
suppose
either
that
the
old
names
were
retained
but
dropped
out
of
use
in
daily
life
or
that
new
names
were
given
at
initiation
and
sedulously
concealed
from
fear
of
sorcery
a
missionary
who
resided
among
the
aborigines
at
lake
tyers
in
victoria
informs
us
that
the
blacks
have
great
objections
to
speak
of
a
person
by
name
in
speaking
to
each
other
they
address
the
person
spoken
to
as
brother
cousin
friend
or
whatever
relation
the
person
spoken
to
bears
sometimes
a
black
bears
a
name
which
we
would
term
merely
a
nickname
as
the
or
the
or
the
little
man
they
would
speak
of
a
person
by
this
name
while
living
but
they
would
never
mention
the
proper
name
i
found
great
difficulty
in
collecting
the
native
names
of
the
blacks
here
i
found
afterwards
that
they
had
given
me
wrong
names
and
on
asking
the
reason
why
was
informed
they
had
two
or
three
names
but
they
never
mentioned
their
right
name
for
fear
any
one
got
it
then
they
would
amongst
the
tribes
of
central
australia
every
man
woman
and
child
has
besides
a
personal
name
which
is
in
common
use
a
secret
or
sacred
name
which
is
bestowed
by
the
older
men
upon
him
or
her
soon
after
birth
and
which
is
known
to
none
but
the
fully
initiated
members
of
the
group
this
secret
name
is
never
mentioned
except
upon
the
most
solemn
occasions
to
utter
it
in
the
hearing
of
women
or
of
men
of
another
group
would
be
a
most
serious
breach
of
tribal
custom
as
serious
as
the
most
flagrant
case
of
sacrilege
among
ourselves
when
mentioned
at
all
the
name
is
spoken
only
in
a
whisper
and
not
until
the
most
elaborate
precautions
have
been
taken
that
it
shall
be
heard
by
no
one
but
members
of
the
group
the
native
thinks
that
a
stranger
knowing
his
secret
name
would
have
special
power
to
work
him
ill
by
means
of
the
same
fear
seems
to
have
led
to
a
custom
of
the
same
sort
amongst
the
ancient
egyptians
whose
comparatively
high
civilisation
was
strangely
dashed
and
chequered
with
relics
of
the
lowest
savagery
every
egyptian
received
two
names
which
were
known
respectively
as
the
true
name
and
the
good
name
or
the
great
name
and
the
little
name
and
while
the
good
or
little
name
was
made
public
the
true
or
great
name
appears
to
have
been
carefully
concealed
similarly
in
abyssinia
at
the
present
day
it
is
customary
to
conceal
the
real
name
which
a
person
receives
at
baptism
and
to
call
him
only
by
a
sort
of
nickname
which
his
mother
gives
him
on
leaving
the
church
the
reason
for
this
concealment
is
that
a
sorcerer
can
not
act
upon
a
person
whose
real
name
he
does
not
know
but
if
he
has
ascertained
his
victim
s
real
name
the
magician
takes
a
particular
kind
of
straw
and
muttering
something
over
it
bends
it
into
a
circle
and
places
it
under
a
stone
the
person
aimed
at
is
taken
ill
at
the
very
moment
of
the
bending
of
the
straw
and
if
the
straw
snaps
he
dies
a
brahman
child
receives
two
names
one
for
common
use
the
other
a
secret
name
which
none
but
his
father
and
mother
should
know
the
latter
is
only
used
at
ceremonies
such
as
marriage
the
custom
is
intended
to
protect
the
person
against
magic
since
a
charm
only
becomes
effectual
in
combination
with
the
real
name
amongst
the
kru
negroes
of
west
africa
a
man
s
real
name
is
always
concealed
from
all
but
his
nearest
relations
to
other
people
he
is
known
only
under
an
assumed
name
the
people
of
the
slave
coast
believe
that
there
is
a
real
and
material
connexion
between
a
man
and
his
name
and
that
by
means
of
the
name
injury
may
be
done
to
the
man
an
illustration
of
this
has
been
given
in
the
case
of
the
that
is
beaten
with
a
stone
to
compass
the
death
of
an
enemy
for
the
name
of
that
enemy
is
not
pronounced
solely
with
the
object
of
informing
the
animating
principle
of
the
stump
who
it
is
whose
death
is
desired
but
through
a
belief
that
by
pronouncing
the
name
the
personality
of
the
man
who
bears
it
is
in
some
way
brought
to
the
the
wolofs
of
senegambia
are
very
much
annoyed
if
any
one
calls
them
in
a
loud
voice
even
by
day
for
they
say
that
their
name
will
be
remembered
by
an
evil
spirit
and
made
use
of
by
him
to
do
them
a
mischief
at
night
similarly
the
natives
of
nias
believe
that
harm
may
be
done
to
a
person
by
the
demons
who
hear
his
name
pronounced
hence
the
names
of
infants
who
are
especially
exposed
to
the
assaults
of
evil
spirits
are
never
spoken
and
often
in
haunted
spots
such
as
the
gloomy
depths
of
the
forest
the
banks
of
a
river
or
beside
a
bubbling
spring
men
will
abstain
from
calling
each
other
by
their
names
for
a
like
reason
among
the
hill
tribes
of
assam
each
individual
has
a
private
name
which
may
not
be
revealed
should
any
one
imprudently
allow
his
private
name
to
be
known
the
whole
village
is
tabooed
for
two
days
and
a
feast
is
provided
at
the
expense
of
the
culprit
a
manegre
of
the
upper
valley
of
the
amoor
will
never
mention
his
own
name
nor
that
of
one
of
his
fellows
only
the
names
of
children
are
an
exception
to
this
rule
a
bagobo
man
of
mindanao
one
of
the
philippine
islands
never
utters
his
own
name
from
fear
of
being
turned
into
a
raven
because
the
raven
croaks
out
its
own
name
the
natives
of
the
east
indian
island
of
buru
and
the
manggarais
of
west
flores
are
forbidden
by
custom
to
mention
their
own
names
when
fafnir
had
received
his
from
sigurd
he
asked
his
slayer
what
his
name
was
but
the
cunning
sigurd
concealed
his
real
name
and
mentioned
a
false
one
because
he
well
knew
how
potent
are
the
words
of
a
dying
man
when
he
curses
his
enemy
by
name
the
indians
of
chiloe
a
large
island
off
the
southern
coast
of
chili
keep
their
names
secret
and
do
not
like
to
have
them
uttered
aloud
for
they
say
that
there
are
fairies
or
imps
on
the
mainland
or
neighbouring
islands
who
if
they
knew
folk
s
names
would
do
them
an
injury
but
so
long
as
they
do
not
know
the
names
these
mischievous
sprites
are
powerless
the
araucanians
who
inhabit
the
mainland
of
chili
to
the
north
of
chiloe
will
hardly
ever
tell
a
stranger
their
names
because
they
fear
that
he
would
thereby
acquire
some
supernatural
power
over
themselves
asked
his
name
by
a
stranger
who
is
ignorant
of
their
superstitions
an
araucanian
will
answer
i
have
names
taken
from
plants
birds
or
other
natural
objects
are
bestowed
on
the
indians
of
guiana
at
their
birth
by
their
parents
or
the
but
these
names
seem
of
little
use
in
that
owners
have
a
very
strong
objection
to
telling
or
using
them
apparently
on
the
ground
that
the
name
is
part
of
the
man
and
that
he
who
knows
the
name
has
part
of
the
owner
of
that
name
in
his
power
to
avoid
any
danger
of
spreading
knowledge
of
their
names
one
indian
therefore
generally
addresses
another
only
according
to
the
relationship
of
the
caller
and
the
called
as
brother
sister
father
mother
and
so
on
or
when
there
is
no
relationship
as
boy
girl
companion
and
so
on
these
terms
therefore
practically
form
the
names
actually
used
by
indians
amongst
amongst
the
indians
of
the
goajira
peninsula
in
colombia
it
is
a
punishable
offence
to
mention
a
man
s
name
in
aggravated
cases
heavy
compensation
is
demanded
the
indians
of
darien
never
tell
their
names
and
when
one
of
them
is
asked
what
is
your
name
he
answers
i
have
for
example
the
guami
of
panama
like
the
greater
part
of
the
american
indians
has
several
names
but
that
under
which
he
is
known
to
his
relations
and
friends
is
never
mentioned
to
a
stranger
according
to
their
ideas
a
stranger
who
should
learn
a
man
s
name
would
obtain
a
secret
power
over
him
as
to
the
girls
they
generally
have
no
name
of
their
own
up
to
the
age
of
among
the
tepehuanes
of
mexico
a
name
is
a
sacred
thing
and
they
never
tell
their
real
native
names
in
north
america
superstitions
of
the
same
sort
are
current
names
bestowed
with
ceremony
in
childhood
says
schoolcraft
are
deemed
sacred
and
are
seldom
pronounced
out
of
respect
it
would
seem
to
the
spirits
under
whose
favour
they
are
supposed
to
have
been
selected
children
are
usually
called
in
the
family
by
some
name
which
can
be
familiarly
the
navajoes
of
new
mexico
are
most
unwilling
to
reveal
their
own
indian
names
or
those
of
their
friends
they
generally
go
by
some
mexican
names
which
they
have
received
from
the
whites
no
apache
will
give
his
name
to
a
stranger
fearing
some
hidden
power
may
thus
be
placed
in
the
stranger
s
hand
to
his
the
tonkawe
indians
of
texas
will
give
their
children
comanche
and
english
names
in
addition
to
their
native
names
which
they
are
unwilling
to
communicate
to
others
for
they
believe
that
when
somebody
calls
a
person
by
his
or
her
native
name
after
death
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
may
hear
it
and
may
be
prompted
to
take
revenge
on
such
as
disturbed
his
rest
whereas
if
the
spirit
be
called
by
a
name
drawn
from
another
language
it
will
pay
no
heed
speaking
of
the
californian
indians
and
especially
of
the
nishinam
tribe
a
writer
observes
one
can
very
seldom
learn
an
indian
s
and
never
a
squaw
s
indian
name
though
they
will
tell
their
american
titles
readily
enough
no
squaw
will
reveal
her
own
name
but
she
will
tell
all
her
neighbors
that
she
can
think
of
for
the
reason
above
given
many
people
believe
that
half
the
squaws
have
no
names
at
all
so
far
is
this
from
the
truth
that
every
one
possesses
at
least
one
and
sometimes
two
or
blackfoot
indians
believe
that
they
would
be
unfortunate
in
all
their
undertakings
if
they
were
to
speak
their
names
when
the
canadian
indians
were
asked
their
names
they
used
to
hang
their
heads
in
silence
or
answer
that
they
did
not
know
when
an
ojebway
is
asked
his
name
he
will
look
at
some
bystander
and
ask
him
to
answer
this
reluctance
arises
from
an
impression
they
receive
when
young
that
if
they
repeat
their
own
names
it
will
prevent
their
growth
and
they
will
be
small
in
stature
on
account
of
this
unwillingness
to
tell
their
names
many
strangers
have
fancied
that
they
either
have
no
names
or
have
forgotten
in
this
last
case
no
scruple
seems
to
be
felt
about
communicating
a
man
s
name
to
strangers
and
no
ill
effects
appear
to
be
dreaded
as
a
consequence
of
divulging
it
harm
is
only
done
when
a
name
is
spoken
by
its
owner
why
is
this
and
why
in
particular
should
a
man
be
thought
to
stunt
his
growth
by
uttering
his
own
name
we
may
conjecture
that
to
savages
who
act
and
think
thus
a
person
s
name
only
seems
to
be
a
part
of
himself
when
it
is
uttered
with
his
own
breath
uttered
by
the
breath
of
others
it
has
no
vital
connexion
with
him
and
no
harm
can
come
to
him
through
it
whereas
so
these
primitive
philosophers
may
have
argued
when
a
man
lets
his
own
name
pass
his
lips
he
is
parting
with
a
living
piece
of
himself
and
if
he
persists
in
so
reckless
a
course
he
must
certainly
end
by
dissipating
his
energy
and
shattering
his
constitution
many
a
debauchee
many
a
feeble
frame
wasted
with
disease
may
have
been
pointed
out
by
these
simple
moralists
to
their
disciples
as
a
fearful
example
of
the
fate
that
must
sooner
or
later
overtake
the
profligate
who
indulges
immoderately
in
the
seductive
habit
of
mentioning
his
own
name
however
we
may
explain
it
the
fact
is
certain
that
many
a
savage
evinces
the
strongest
reluctance
to
pronounce
his
own
name
while
at
the
same
time
he
makes
no
objection
at
all
to
other
people
pronouncing
it
and
will
even
invite
them
to
do
so
for
him
in
order
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
an
inquisitive
stranger
thus
in
some
parts
of
madagascar
it
is
or
taboo
for
a
person
to
tell
his
own
name
but
a
slave
or
attendant
will
answer
for
him
chatting
with
an
old
sakalava
while
the
men
were
packing
up
we
happened
to
ask
him
his
name
whereupon
he
politely
requested
us
to
ask
one
of
his
servants
standing
by
on
expressing
our
astonishment
that
he
should
have
forgotten
this
he
told
us
that
it
was
tabooed
for
one
of
his
tribe
to
pronounce
his
own
name
we
found
this
was
perfectly
true
in
that
district
but
it
is
not
the
case
with
the
sakalava
a
few
days
farther
down
the
the
same
curious
inconsistency
as
it
may
seem
to
us
is
recorded
of
some
tribes
of
american
indians
thus
we
are
told
that
the
name
of
an
american
indian
is
a
sacred
thing
not
to
be
divulged
by
the
owner
himself
without
due
consideration
one
may
ask
a
warrior
of
any
tribe
to
give
his
name
and
the
question
will
be
met
with
either
a
refusal
or
the
more
diplomatic
evasion
that
he
can
not
understand
what
is
wanted
of
him
the
moment
a
friend
approaches
the
warrior
first
interrogated
will
whisper
what
is
wanted
and
the
friend
can
tell
the
name
receiving
a
reciprocation
of
the
courtesy
from
the
this
general
statement
applies
for
example
to
the
indian
tribes
of
british
columbia
as
to
whom
it
is
said
that
one
of
their
strangest
prejudices
which
appears
to
pervade
all
tribes
alike
is
a
dislike
to
telling
their
you
never
get
a
man
s
right
name
from
himself
but
they
will
tell
each
other
s
names
without
though
it
is
considered
very
rude
for
a
stranger
to
ask
an
apache
his
name
and
the
apache
will
never
mention
it
himself
he
will
allow
his
friend
at
his
side
to
mention
it
for
him
the
abipones
of
south
america
thought
it
a
sin
in
a
man
to
utter
his
own
name
but
they
would
tell
each
other
s
names
freely
when
father
dobrizhoffer
asked
a
stranger
indian
his
name
the
man
would
nudge
his
neighbour
with
his
elbow
as
a
sign
that
his
companion
should
answer
the
question
some
of
the
malemut
esquimaux
of
bering
strait
dislike
very
much
to
pronounce
their
own
names
if
a
man
be
asked
his
name
he
will
appear
confused
and
will
generally
turn
to
a
bystander
and
request
him
to
mention
it
for
him
in
the
whole
of
the
east
indian
archipelago
the
etiquette
is
the
same
as
a
general
rule
no
one
will
utter
his
own
name
to
enquire
what
is
your
name
is
a
very
indelicate
question
in
native
society
when
in
the
course
of
administrative
or
judicial
business
a
native
is
asked
his
name
instead
of
replying
he
will
look
at
his
comrade
to
indicate
that
he
is
to
answer
for
him
or
he
will
say
straight
out
ask
the
superstition
is
current
all
over
the
east
indies
without
exception
and
it
is
found
also
among
the
motu
and
motumotu
tribes
of
british
new
guinea
the
papuans
of
finsch
haven
in
german
new
guinea
the
nufoors
of
dutch
new
guinea
and
the
melanesians
of
the
bismarck
archipelago
among
many
tribes
of
south
africa
men
and
women
never
mention
their
names
if
they
can
get
any
one
else
to
do
it
for
them
but
they
do
not
absolutely
refuse
when
it
can
not
be
avoided
no
warua
will
tell
his
name
but
he
does
not
object
to
being
addressed
by
it
among
the
masai
when
a
man
is
called
or
spoken
to
he
is
addressed
by
his
father
s
name
and
his
own
name
is
only
used
when
speaking
to
his
mother
it
is
considered
unlucky
for
a
man
to
be
addressed
by
name
the
methods
employed
in
finding
out
what
an
individual
is
called
seem
apt
to
lead
to
confusion
if
a
man
is
asked
his
name
he
replies
by
giving
that
of
his
father
and
to
arrive
at
his
own
name
it
is
necessary
to
ask
a
third
person
or
to
ask
him
what
is
the
name
of
his
mother
there
is
no
objection
to
another
person
mentioning
his
name
even
in
his
we
are
told
that
the
wanyamwesi
almost
always
address
each
other
as
mate
or
friend
and
a
man
sometimes
quite
forgets
his
own
name
and
has
to
be
reminded
of
it
by
another
the
writer
who
makes
this
statement
was
probably
unaware
of
the
reluctance
of
many
savages
to
utter
their
own
names
and
hence
he
mistook
that
reluctance
for
forgetfulness
in
uganda
no
one
will
mention
his
totem
if
it
is
necessary
that
it
should
be
known
he
will
ask
a
bystander
to
mention
it
for
him
the
in
the
congo
region
are
unwilling
to
pronounce
the
name
of
their
tribe
if
they
are
pressed
on
the
subject
they
will
call
on
some
foreigner
to
give
the
required
information
sometimes
the
embargo
laid
on
personal
names
is
not
permanent
it
is
conditional
on
circumstances
and
when
these
change
it
ceases
to
operate
thus
when
the
nandi
men
are
away
on
a
foray
nobody
at
home
may
pronounce
the
names
of
the
absent
warriors
they
must
be
referred
to
as
birds
should
a
child
so
far
forget
itself
as
to
mention
one
of
the
distant
ones
by
name
the
mother
would
rebuke
it
saying
don
t
talk
of
the
birds
who
are
in
the
among
the
bangala
of
the
upper
congo
while
a
man
is
fishing
and
when
he
returns
with
his
catch
his
proper
name
is
in
abeyance
and
nobody
may
mention
it
whatever
the
fisherman
s
real
name
may
be
he
is
called
without
distinction
the
reason
is
that
the
river
is
full
of
spirits
who
if
they
heard
the
fisherman
s
real
name
might
so
work
against
him
that
he
would
catch
little
or
nothing
even
when
he
has
caught
his
fish
and
landed
with
them
the
buyer
must
still
not
address
him
by
his
proper
name
but
must
only
call
him
for
even
then
if
the
spirits
were
to
hear
his
proper
name
they
would
either
bear
it
in
mind
and
serve
him
out
another
day
or
they
might
so
mar
the
fish
he
had
caught
that
he
would
get
very
little
for
them
hence
the
fisherman
can
extract
heavy
damages
from
anybody
who
mentions
his
name
or
can
compel
the
thoughtless
speaker
to
relieve
him
of
the
fish
at
a
good
price
so
as
to
restore
his
luck
when
the
sulka
of
new
britain
are
near
the
territory
of
their
enemies
the
gaktei
they
take
care
not
to
mention
them
by
their
proper
name
believing
that
were
they
to
do
so
their
foes
would
attack
and
slay
them
hence
in
these
circumstances
they
speak
of
the
gaktei
as
that
is
the
rotten
and
they
imagine
that
by
calling
them
that
they
make
the
limbs
of
their
dreaded
enemies
ponderous
and
clumsy
like
logs
this
example
illustrates
the
extremely
materialistic
view
which
these
savages
take
of
the
nature
of
words
they
suppose
that
the
mere
utterance
of
an
expression
signifying
clumsiness
will
homoeopathically
affect
with
clumsiness
the
limbs
of
their
distant
foemen
another
illustration
of
this
curious
misconception
is
furnished
by
a
caffre
superstition
that
the
character
of
a
young
thief
can
be
reformed
by
shouting
his
name
over
a
boiling
kettle
of
medicated
water
then
clapping
a
lid
on
the
kettle
and
leaving
the
name
to
steep
in
the
water
for
several
days
it
is
not
in
the
least
necessary
that
the
thief
should
be
aware
of
the
use
that
is
being
made
of
his
name
behind
his
back
the
moral
reformation
will
be
effected
without
his
knowledge
when
it
is
deemed
necessary
that
a
man
s
real
name
should
be
kept
secret
it
is
often
customary
as
we
have
seen
to
call
him
by
a
surname
or
nickname
as
distinguished
from
the
real
or
primary
names
these
secondary
names
are
apparently
held
to
be
no
part
of
the
man
himself
so
that
they
may
be
freely
used
and
divulged
to
everybody
without
endangering
his
safety
thereby
sometimes
in
order
to
avoid
the
use
of
his
own
name
a
man
will
be
called
after
his
child
thus
we
are
informed
that
the
gippsland
blacks
objected
strongly
to
let
any
one
outside
the
tribe
know
their
names
lest
their
enemies
learning
them
should
make
them
vehicles
of
incantation
and
so
charm
their
lives
away
as
children
were
not
thought
to
have
enemies
they
used
to
speak
of
a
man
as
the
father
uncle
or
cousin
of
naming
a
child
but
on
all
occasions
abstained
from
mentioning
the
name
of
a
similarly
among
the
nufoors
of
dutch
new
guinea
persons
who
are
related
by
marriage
may
not
mention
each
other
s
names
but
it
is
lawful
to
mention
the
names
of
children
hence
in
order
to
designate
a
person
whose
name
they
may
not
pronounce
they
will
speak
of
him
or
her
as
the
father
or
mother
of
the
alfoors
of
poso
in
celebes
will
not
pronounce
their
own
names
among
them
accordingly
if
you
wish
to
ascertain
a
person
s
name
you
ought
not
to
ask
the
man
himself
but
should
enquire
of
others
but
if
this
is
impossible
for
example
when
there
is
no
one
else
near
you
should
ask
him
his
child
s
name
and
then
address
him
as
the
father
of
nay
these
alfoors
are
shy
of
uttering
the
names
even
of
children
so
when
a
boy
or
girl
has
a
nephew
or
niece
he
or
she
is
addressed
as
uncle
of
or
aunt
of
in
pure
malay
society
we
are
told
a
man
is
never
asked
his
name
and
the
custom
of
naming
parents
after
their
children
is
adopted
only
as
a
means
of
avoiding
the
use
of
the
parents
own
names
the
writer
who
makes
this
statement
adds
in
confirmation
of
it
that
childless
persons
are
named
after
their
younger
brothers
among
the
land
dyaks
of
northern
borneo
children
as
they
grow
up
are
called
according
to
their
sex
the
father
or
mother
of
a
child
of
their
father
s
or
mother
s
younger
brother
or
sister
that
is
they
are
called
the
father
or
mother
of
what
we
should
call
their
first
cousin
the
caffres
used
to
think
it
discourteous
to
call
a
bride
by
her
own
name
so
they
would
call
her
the
mother
of
even
when
she
was
only
betrothed
far
less
a
wife
and
a
mother
among
the
kukis
and
zemis
or
kacha
nagas
of
assam
parents
drop
their
own
names
after
the
birth
of
a
child
and
are
named
father
and
mother
of
childless
couples
go
by
the
names
of
the
childless
father
the
childless
mother
the
father
of
no
child
the
mother
of
no
a
zulu
woman
may
not
utter
her
husband
s
name
if
she
speaks
to
or
of
him
she
says
father
of
mentioning
the
name
of
one
of
his
children
a
hindoo
woman
will
not
name
her
husband
if
she
has
to
refer
to
him
she
will
designate
him
as
the
father
of
her
child
or
by
some
other
periphrasis
the
widespread
custom
of
naming
a
father
after
his
child
has
sometimes
been
supposed
to
spring
from
a
desire
on
the
father
s
part
to
assert
his
paternity
apparently
as
a
means
of
obtaining
those
rights
over
his
children
which
had
previously
under
a
system
of
been
possessed
by
the
mother
but
this
explanation
does
not
account
for
the
parallel
custom
of
naming
the
mother
after
her
child
which
seems
commonly
to
with
the
practice
of
naming
the
father
after
the
child
still
less
if
possible
does
it
apply
to
the
customs
of
calling
childless
couples
the
father
and
mother
of
children
which
do
not
exist
of
naming
people
after
their
younger
brothers
and
of
designating
children
as
the
uncles
and
aunts
of
or
as
the
fathers
and
mothers
of
their
first
cousins
but
all
these
practices
are
explained
in
a
simple
and
natural
way
if
we
suppose
that
they
originate
in
a
reluctance
to
utter
the
real
names
of
persons
addressed
or
directly
referred
to
that
reluctance
is
probably
based
partly
on
a
fear
of
attracting
the
notice
of
evil
spirits
partly
on
a
dread
of
revealing
the
name
to
sorcerers
who
would
thereby
obtain
a
handle
for
injuring
the
owner
of
the
name
names
of
relations
tabooed
it
might
naturally
be
expected
that
the
reserve
so
commonly
maintained
with
regard
to
personal
names
would
be
dropped
or
at
least
relaxed
among
relations
and
friends
but
the
reverse
of
this
is
often
the
case
it
is
precisely
the
persons
most
intimately
connected
by
blood
and
especially
by
marriage
to
whom
the
rule
applies
with
the
greatest
stringency
such
people
are
often
forbidden
not
only
to
pronounce
each
other
s
names
but
even
to
utter
ordinary
words
which
resemble
or
have
a
single
syllable
in
common
with
these
names
the
persons
who
are
thus
mutually
debarred
from
mentioning
each
other
s
names
are
especially
husbands
and
wives
a
man
and
his
wife
s
parents
and
a
woman
and
her
husband
s
father
for
example
among
the
caffres
of
south
africa
a
woman
may
not
publicly
pronounce
the
of
her
husband
or
of
any
of
his
brothers
nor
may
she
use
the
interdicted
word
in
its
ordinary
sense
if
her
husband
for
instance
be
called
from
a
small
feline
animal
she
must
speak
of
that
beast
by
some
other
name
further
a
caffre
wife
is
forbidden
to
pronounce
even
mentally
the
names
of
her
and
of
all
her
husband
s
male
relations
in
the
ascending
line
and
whenever
the
emphatic
syllable
of
any
of
their
names
occurs
in
another
word
she
must
avoid
it
by
substituting
either
an
entirely
new
word
or
at
least
another
syllable
in
its
place
hence
this
custom
has
given
rise
to
an
almost
distinct
language
among
the
women
which
the
caffres
call
or
women
s
the
interpretation
of
this
women
s
speech
is
naturally
very
difficult
for
no
definite
rules
can
be
given
for
the
formation
of
these
substituted
words
nor
is
it
possible
to
form
a
dictionary
of
them
their
number
being
so
there
may
be
many
women
even
in
the
same
tribe
who
would
be
no

on

said
that

have
been

by
no

provocation
than
the

or
bataks
of
sumatra
display
a
great
aversion
to
mentioning
their
own
names
and
a
still
greater
aversion
to
mentioning
the
names
of
their
parents
grandparents
or
elder
politeness
forbids
the
putting
of
direct
questions
on
this
subject
so
that
the
investigation
of
personal
identity
becomes
difficult
and
laborious
when
a
batta
expects
to
be
questioned
as
to
his
relations
he
will
usually
provide
himself
with
a
friend
to
answer
for
him
a
batak
man
may
never
mention
the
names
of
his
wife
his
and
of
his
a
woman
is
most
particularly
forbidden
to
mention
the
name
of
the
man
who
has
married
her
daughter
among
the
the
forbidden
names
are
those
of
parents
uncles
aunts
brothers
and
sisters
and
especially
grandparents
among
the
dyaks
a
child
never
pronounces
the
names
of
his
parents
and
is
angry
if
any
one
else
does
so
in
his
presence
a
husband
never
calls
his
wife
by
her
name
and
she
never
calls
him
by
his
if
they
have
children
they
name
each
other
after
them
father
of
and
mother
of
if
they
have
no
children
they
use
the
pronouns
he
and
she
or
an
expression
such
as
he
or
she
whom
i
love
and
in
general
members
of
a
dyak
family
do
not
mention
each
other
s
names
moreover
when
the
personal
names
happen
also
as
they
often
do
to
be
names
of
common
objects
the
dyak
is
debarred
from
designating
these
objects
by
their
ordinary
names
for
instance
if
a
man
or
one
of
his
family
is
called
bintang
which
means
star
he
must
not
call
a
star
a
star
he
must
call
it
a
if
he
or
a
member
of
his
domestic
circle
bears
the
name
of
bulan
which
means
moon
he
may
not
speak
of
the
moon
as
the
moon
he
must
call
it
hence
it
comes
about
that
in
the
dyak
language
there
are
two
sets
of
distinct
names
for
many
objects
among
the
sea
dyaks
of
sarawak
a
man
may
not
pronounce
the
name
of
his
or
without
incurring
the
wrath
of
the
spirits
and
since
he
reckons
as
his
and
not
only
the
father
and
mother
of
his
own
wife
but
also
the
fathers
and
mothers
of
his
brothers
wives
and
sisters
husbands
and
likewise
the
fathers
and
mothers
of
all
his
cousins
the
number
of
tabooed
names
may
be
very
considerable
and
the
opportunities
of
error
correspondingly
numerous
to
make
confusion
worse
confounded
the
names
of
persons
are
often
the
names
of
common
things
such
as
moon
bridge
barley
cobra
leopard
so
that
when
any
of
a
man
s
many
and
are
called
by
such
names
these
common
words
may
not
pass
his
lips
among
the
dyaks
of
landak
and
tajan
it
is
forbidden
to
mention
the
names
of
parents
and
grandparents
sometimes
also
of
whether
they
are
alive
or
dead
among
the
alfoors
or
toradjas
of
poso
in
central
celebes
you
may
not
pronounce
the
names
of
your
father
mother
grandparents
and
other
near
relations
but
the
strictest
taboo
is
on
the
names
of
a
and
a
may
not
only
never
mention
the
names
of
their
but
if
the
names
happen
to
be
ordinary
words
of
the
language
they
may
never
allow
the
words
in
their
common
significance
to
pass
their
lips
for
example
if
my
father
is
called
njara
horse
i
may
not
speak
of
him
by
that
name
but
in
speaking
of
the
animal
i
am
free
to
use
the
word
horse
but
if
my
is
called
njara
the
case
is
different
for
then
not
only
may
i
not
refer
to
him
by
his
name
but
i
may
not
even
call
a
horse
a
horse
in
speaking
of
the
animal
i
must
use
some
other
word
the
missionary
who
reports
the
custom
is
acquainted
with
a
man
whose
rejoices
in
the
name
of
ringgi
rixdollar
when
this
man
has
occasion
to
refer
to
real
rixdollars
he
alludes
to
them
delicately
as
large
guilders
another
man
may
not
use
the
ordinary
word
for
water
in
speaking
of
water
he
employs
a
word
taken
from
a
different
dialect
indeed
among
these
alfoors
it
is
the
common
practice
in
such
cases
to
replace
the
forbidden
word
by
a
kindred
word
of
the
same
significance
borrowed
from
another
dialect
in
this
way
many
fresh
terms
or
new
forms
of
an
old
word
pass
into
general
circulation
among
the
alfoors
of
minahassa
in
northern
celebes
the
custom
is
carried
still
further
so
as
to
forbid
the
use
even
of
words
which
merely
resemble
the
personal
names
in
sound
it
is
especially
the
name
of
a
which
is
thus
laid
under
an
interdict
if
he
for
example
is
called
kalala
his
may
not
speak
of
a
horse
by
its
common
name
he
must
call
it
a
so
among
the
alfoors
of
the
island
of
buru
it
is
taboo
to
mention
the
names
of
parents
and
or
even
to
speak
of
common
objects
by
words
which
resemble
these
names
in
sound
thus
if
your
is
called
dalu
which
means
betel
you
may
not
ask
for
betel
by
its
ordinary
name
you
must
ask
for
red
mouth
if
you
want
you
may
not
say
you
must
say
in
the
same
island
it
is
also
taboo
to
mention
the
name
of
an
elder
brother
in
his
presence
transgressions
of
these
rules
are
punished
with
fines
in
bolang
mongondo
a
district
in
the
west
of
celebes
the
unmentionable
names
are
those
of
parents
uncles
and
aunts
among
the
alfoors
of
halmahera
a
may
never
use
his
s
name
in
speaking
to
him
he
must
simply
address
him
as
in
sunda
it
is
thought
that
a
particular
crop
would
be
spoilt
if
a
man
were
to
mention
the
names
of
his
father
and
mother
among
the
nufoors
as
we
have
seen
persons
who
are
related
to
each
other
by
marriage
are
forbidden
to
mention
each
other
s
names
among
the
connexions
whose
names
are
thus
tabooed
are
wife
your
wife
s
uncles
and
aunts
and
also
her
and
and
the
whole
of
your
wife
s
or
your
husband
s
family
in
the
same
generation
as
yourself
except
that
men
may
mention
the
names
of
their
though
women
may
not
the
taboo
comes
into
operation
as
soon
as
the
betrothal
has
taken
place
and
before
the
marriage
has
been
celebrated
families
thus
connected
by
the
betrothal
of
two
of
their
members
are
not
only
forbidden
to
pronounce
each
other
s
names
they
may
not
even
look
at
each
other
and
the
rule
gives
rise
to
the
most
comical
scenes
when
they
happen
to
meet
unexpectedly
and
not
merely
the
names
themselves
but
any
words
that
sound
like
them
are
scrupulously
avoided
and
other
words
used
in
their
place
if
it
should
chance
that
a
person
has
inadvertently
uttered
a
forbidden
name
he
must
at
once
throw
himself
on
the
floor
and
say
i
have
mentioned
a
wrong
name
i
throw
it
through
the
chinks
of
the
floor
in
order
that
i
may
eat
in
german
new
guinea
near
relations
by
marriage
particularly
and
and
as
well
as
and
must
see
as
little
of
each
other
as
possible
they
may
not
converse
together
and
they
may
not
mention
each
other
s
names
not
even
when
these
names
have
passed
to
younger
members
of
the
family
thus
if
a
child
is
called
after
its
deceased
paternal
grandfather
the
mother
may
not
call
her
child
by
its
name
but
must
employ
another
name
for
the
purpose
among
the
yabim
for
example
on
the
coast
of
german
new
guinea
may
neither
be
touched
nor
named
even
when
their
names
are
borne
by
other
people
or
are
the
ordinary
names
of
common
objects
they
may
not
pass
the
lips
of
their
and
among
the
western
tribes
of
british
new
guinea
the
principal
taboo
or
as
it
is
there
called
concerns
the
names
of
relatives
by
marriage
a
man
may
not
mention
the
name
of
his
wife
s
father
mother
elder
sister
or
elder
brother
nor
the
name
of
any
male
or
female
relative
of
her
father
or
mother
so
long
as
the
relative
in
question
is
a
member
of
the
same
tribe
as
the
speaker
the
names
of
his
wife
s
younger
brothers
and
sisters
are
not
tabooed
to
him
the
same
law
applies
to
a
woman
with
reference
to
the
names
of
her
husband
s
relatives
as
a
general
rule
this
taboo
does
not
extend
outside
the
tribal
boundaries
hence
when
a
man
or
woman
marries
out
of
his
or
her
tribe
the
taboo
is
usually
not
applied
and
when
members
of
one
tribe
who
may
not
pronounce
each
other
s
names
at
home
are
away
from
their
own
territory
they
are
no
longer
strictly
bound
to
observe
the
prohibition
a
breach
of
the
taboo
has
to
be
atoned
for
by
the
offender
paying
a
fine
to
the
person
whose
name
he
has
taken
in
vain
until
that
has
been
done
neither
of
the
parties
concerned
if
they
are
males
may
enter
the
men
s
in
the
old
times
the
offended
party
might
recover
his
social
standing
by
cutting
off
somebody
else
s
head
in
the
western
islands
of
torres
straits
a
man
never
mentioned
the
personal
names
of
his
and
and
a
woman
was
subject
to
the
same
restrictions
a
might
be
spoken
of
as
the
husband
or
brother
of
some
one
whose
name
it
was
lawful
to
mention
and
similarly
a
might
be
called
the
wife
of
if
a
man
by
chance
used
the
personal
name
of
his
he
was
ashamed
and
hung
his
head
his
shame
was
only
relieved
when
he
had
made
a
present
as
compensation
to
the
man
whose
name
he
had
taken
in
vain
the
same
compensation
was
made
to
a
a
and
a
for
the
accidental
mention
of
their
names
this
disability
to
use
the
personal
names
of
relatives
by
marriage
was
associated
with
the
custom
so
common
throughout
the
world
that
a
man
or
woman
is
not
allowed
to
speak
to
these
relatives
if
a
man
wished
to
communicate
with
his
or
he
spoke
to
his
wife
and
she
spoke
to
her
parent
when
direct
communication
became
absolutely
necessary
it
was
said
that
a
man
might
talk
to
his
or
a
very
little
in
a
low
voice
the
behaviour
towards
a
was
the
same
similar
taboos
on
the
names
of
persons
connected
by

in
force
in
new
britain
and
new
ireland
among
the
natives
who
inhabit
the
coast
of
the
gazelle
peninsula
in
new
britain
to
mention
the
name
of
a
is
the
grossest
possible
affront
you
can
offer
to
him
it
is
a
crime
punishable
with
death
in
the
santa
cruz
and
reef
islands
a
man
is
forbidden
to
pronounce
the
name
of

he
may
never
see
her
face
so
long
as
he
lives
she
on
her
side
lies
under
similar
restrictions
in

to
him
further
a
man
is
prohibited
from
mentioning
the
name
of
his
though
he
is
allowed
to
look
at
him
and
if
a
husband
has
paid
money
for
his
wife
to
several
men
none
of
these
men
may
ever
utter
his
name
or
look
him
in
the
face
if
one
of
them
did
by
chance
look
at
him
the
offended
husband
would
destroy
some
of
the

property
in

caledonia
a

may
not
mention
his

name
and
she
may

rule
is
observed
by

in
the

melanesia
the
taboos
laid
on
the
names
of

are
very
strict
a

will
not
mention
the

much
less
the

nor
may
he
name
his

nothing

a

her
two

forbidden

to

and
when
that
was
not
understood
went
and
touched
it
with
his
hand
to
shew
what
he
meant
a
difficulty
being
still
made
he
looked
round
to
be
sure
that
no
one
was
near
and
whispered
not
the
name
of
his
son
s
wife
but
the
respectful
substitute
for
her
name
she
who
was
with
his
son
and
whose
name
was
tuwarina
again
we
hear
of
a
native
of
these
islands
who
might
not
use
the
common
words
for
pig
and
to
die
because
these
words
occurred
in
the
polysyllabic
name
of
his
and
we
are
told
of
another
unfortunate
who
might
not
pronounce
the
everyday
words
for
hand
and
hot
on
account
of
his
wife
s
brother
s
name
and
who
was
even
debarred
from
mentioning
the
number
one
because
the
word
for
one
formed
part
of
the
name
of
his
wife
s
cousin
it
might
be
expected
that
similar
taboos
on
the
names
of
relations
and
on
words
resembling
them
would
commonly
occur
among
the
aborigines
of
australia
and
that
some
light
might
be
thrown
on
their
origin
and
meaning
by
the
primitive
modes
of
thought
and
forms
of
society
prevalent
among
these
savages
yet
this
expectation
can
scarcely
be
said
to
be
fulfilled
for
the
evidence
of
the
observance
of
such
customs
in
australia
is
scanty
and
hardly
of
a
nature
to
explain
their
origin
we
are
told
that
there
are
instances
in
which
the
names
of
natives
are
never
allowed
to
be
spoken
as
those
of
a
father
or
of
a
and
some
cases
arising
from
a
connection
with
each
other
s
among
some
victorian
tribes
a
man
never
at
any
time
mentioned
the
name
of
his
and
from
the
time
of
his
betrothal
to
his
death
neither
she
nor
her
sisters
might
ever
look
at
or
speak
to
him
he
might
not
go
within
fifty
yards
of
their
habitation
and
when
he
met
them
on
a
path
they
immediately
left
it
clapped
their
hands
and
covering
up
their
heads
with
their
rugs
walked
in
a
stooping
posture
and
spoke
in
whispers
until
he
had
gone
by
they
might
not
talk
with
him
and
when
he
and
they
spoke
to
other
people
in
each
other
s
presence
they
used
a
special
form
of
speech
which
went
by
the
name
of
turn
this
was
not
done
with
any
intention
of
concealing
their
meaning
for
turn
tongue
was
understood
by
everybody
a
writer
who
enjoyed
unusually
favourable
opportunities
of
learning
the
language
and
customs
of
the
victorian
aborigines
informs
us
that
a
stupid
custom
existed
among
them
which
they
called
whenever
a
female
child
was
promised
in
marriage
to
any
man
from
that
very
hour
neither
he
nor
the
child
s
mother
were
permitted
to
look
upon
or
hear
each
other
speak
nor
hear
their
names
mentioned
by
others
for
if
they
did
they
would
immediately
grow
prematurely
old
and
among
the
gudangs
of
cape
york
in
queensland
and
the
kowraregas
of
the
prince
of
wales
islands
a
man
carefully
avoids
speaking
to
or
even
mentioning
the
name
of
his
and
his
wife
acts
similarly
with
regard
to
her
thus
the
mother
of
a
person
called
means
obliged
to
call
water
by
another
in
the
booandik
tribe
of
south
australia
persons
connected
by
marriage
except
husbands
and
wives
spoke
to
each
other
in
a
low
whining
voice
and
employed
words
different
from
those
in
common
use
another
writer
speaking
of
the
same
tribe
says
and
studiously
avoid
each
other
a
converses
with
his
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
and
in
a
phraseology
differing
somewhat
from
the
ordinary
it
will
perhaps
occur
to
the
reader
that
customs
of
this
latter
sort
may
possibly
have
originated
in
the
intermarriage
of
tribes
speaking
different
languages
and
there
are
some
australian
facts
which
seem
at
first
sight
to
favour
this
supposition
thus
with
regard
to
the
natives
of
south
australia
we
are
told
that
the
principal
mark
of
distinction
between
the
tribes
is
difference
of
language
or
dialect
where
the
tribes
intermix
greatly
no
inconvenience
is
experienced
on
this
account
as
every
person
understands
in
addition
to
his
own
dialect
that
of
the
neighbouring
tribe
the
consequence
is
that
two
persons
commonly
converse
in
two
languages
just
as
an
englishman
and
german
would
hold
a
conversation
each
person
speaking
his
own
language
but
understanding
that
of
the
other
as
well
as
his
own
this
peculiarity
will
often
occur
in
one
family
through
intermarriages
neither
party
ever
thinking
of
changing
his
or
her
dialect
for
that
of
the
other
children
do
not
always
adopt
the
language
of
the
mother
but
that
of
the
tribe
among
whom
they
among
some
tribes
of
western
victoria
a
man
was
actually
forbidden
to
marry
a
wife
who
spoke
the
same
dialect
as
himself
and
during
the
preliminary
visit
which
each
paid
to
the
tribe
of
the
other
neither
was
permitted
to
speak
the
language
of
the
tribe
which
he
or
she
was
visiting
the
children
spoke
the
language
of
their
father
and
might
never
mix
it
with
any
other
to
her
children
the
mother
spoke
in
their
father
s
language
but
to
her
husband
she
spoke
in
her
own
and
he
answered
her
in
his
so
that
all
conversation
is
carried
on
between
husband
and
wife
in
the
same
way
as
between
an
englishman
and
a
frenchwoman
each
speaking
his
or
her
own
language
this
very
remarkable
law
explains
the
preservation
of
so
many
distinct
dialects
within
so
limited
a
space
even
where
there
are
no
physical
obstacles
to
ready
and
frequent
communication
between
the
so
amongst
the
sakais
an
aboriginal
race
of
the
malay
peninsula
a
man
goes
to
a
considerable
distance
for
a
wife
generally
to
a
tribe
who
speak
quite
a
different
dialect
the
indian
tribes
of
french
guiana
have
each
their
own
dialect
and
would
hardly
be
able
to
understand
each
other
were
it
not
that
almost
every
person
marries
a
wife
or
a
husband
of
a
different
tribe
and
thus
the
newcomers
serve
as
interpreters
between
the
tribe
in
which
they
live
and
that
in
which
they
were
born
and
brought
up
it
is
well
known
that
the
carib
women
spoke
a
language
which
differed
in
some
respects
from
that
of
the
men
and
the
explanation
generally
given
of
the
difference
is
that
the
women
preserved
the
language
of
a
race
of
whom
the
men
had
been
exterminated
and
the
women
married
by
the
caribs
this
explanation
is
not
as
some
seem
to
suppose
a
mere
hypothesis
of
the
learned
devised
to
clear
up
a
curious
discrepancy
it
was
a
tradition
current
among
the
caribs
themselves
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
as
such
it
deserves
serious
attention
but
there
are
other
facts
which
seem
to
point
to
a
different
explanation
among
the
carayahis
a
tribe
of
brazilian
indians
on
the
rio
grande
or
araguaya
river
the
dialect
of
the
women
differs
from
that
of
the
men
for
the
most
part
the
differences
are
limited
to
the
form
and
sound
of
the
words
only
a
few
words
seem
to
be
quite
distinct
in
the
two
dialects
the
speech
of
the
women
appears
to
preserve
older
and
fuller
forms
than
that
of
the
men
for
instance
girl
is
in
the
female
speech
but
in
the
male
nail
is
in
the
mouth
of
a
woman
but
in
the
mouth
of
a
man
however
such
remarkable
differences
are
to
be
explained
a
little
reflection
will
probably
convince
us
that
a
mere
intermixture
of
races
speaking
different
tongues
could
scarcely
account
for
the
phenomena
of
language
under
consideration
for
the
reluctance
to
mention
the
names
or
even
syllables
of
the
names
of
persons
connected
with
the
speaker
by
marriage
can
hardly
be
separated
from
the
reluctance
evinced
by
so
many
people
to
utter
their
own
names
or
the
names
of
the
dead
or
of
chiefs
and
kings
and
if
the
reticence
as
to
these
latter
names
springs
mainly
from
superstition
we
may
infer
that
the
reticence
as
to
the
former
has
no
better
foundation
that
the
savage
s
unwillingness
to
mention
his
own
name
is
based
at
least
in
part
on
a
superstitious
fear
of
the
ill
use
that
might
be
made
of
it
by
his
foes
whether
human
or
spiritual
has
already
been
shewn
it
remains
to
examine
the
similar
usage
in
regard
to
the
names
of
the
dead
and
of
royal
personages
names
of
the
dead
tabooed
the
custom
of
abstaining
from
all
mention
of
the
names
of
the
dead
was
observed
in
antiquity
by
the
albanians
of
the
caucasus
and
at
the
present
day
it
is
in
full
force
among
many
savage
tribes
thus
we
are
told
that
one
of
the
customs
most
rigidly
observed
and
enforced
amongst
the
australian
aborigines
is
never
to
mention
the
name
of
a
deceased
person
whether
male
or
female
to
name
aloud
one
who
has
departed
this
life
would
be
a
gross
violation
of
their
most
sacred
prejudices
and
they
carefully
abstain
from
it
the
chief
motive
for
this
abstinence
appears
to
be
a
fear
of
evoking
the
ghost
although
the
natural
unwillingness
to
revive
past
sorrows
undoubtedly
operates
also
to
draw
the
veil
of
oblivion
over
the
names
of
the
dead
once
oldfield
so
terrified
a
native
by
shouting
out
the
name
of
a
deceased
person
that
the
man
fairly
took
to
his
heels
and
did
not
venture
to
shew
himself
again
for
several
days
at
their
next
meeting
he
bitterly
reproached
the
rash
white
man
for
his
indiscretion
nor
could
i
adds
oldfield
induce
him
by
any
means
to
utter
the
awful
sound
of
a
dead
man
s
name
for
by
so
doing
he
would
have
placed
himself
in
the
power
of
the
malign
on
another
occasion
a
watchandie
woman
having
mentioned
the
name
of
a
certain
man
was
informed
that
he
had
long
been
dead
at
that
she
became
greatly
excited
and
spat
thrice
to
counteract
the
evil
effect
of
having
taken
a
dead
man
s
name
into
her
lips
this
custom
of
spitting
thrice
as
oldfield
afterwards
learned
was
the
regular
charm
whereby
the
natives
freed
themselves
from
the
power
of
the
dangerous
spirits
whom
they
had
provoked
by
such
a
rash
act
among
the
aborigines
of
victoria
the
dead
were
very
rarely
spoken
of
and
then
never
by
their
names
they
were
referred
to
in
a
subdued
voice
as
the
lost
one
or
the
poor
fellow
that
is
no
to
speak
of
them
by
name
would
it
was
supposed
excite
the
malignity
of
the
spirit
of
the
departed
which
hovers
on
earth
for
a
time
before
it
departs
for
ever
towards
the
setting
sun
once
when
a
kurnai
man
was
spoken
to
about
a
dead
friend
soon
after
the
decease
he
looked
round
uneasily
and
said
do
not
do
that
he
might
hear
you
and
kill
me
if
a
kaiabara
black
dies
his
never
mention
his
name
but
call
him
the
dead
and
in
order
to
explain
who
it
is
that
has
died
they
speak
of
his
father
mother
brothers
and
so
forth
of
the
tribes
on
the
lower
murray
river
we
are
told
that
when
a
person
dies
they
carefully
avoid
mentioning
his
name
but
if
compelled
to
do
so
they
pronounce
it
in
a
very
low
whisper
so
faint
that
they
imagine
the
spirit
can
not
hear
their
amongst
the
tribes
of
central
australia
no
one
may
utter
the
name
of
the
deceased
during
the
period
of
mourning
unless
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
do
so
and
then
it
is
only
done
in
a
whisper
for
fear
of
disturbing
and
annoying
the
man
s
spirit
which
is
walking
about
in
ghostly
form
if
the
ghost
hears
his
name
mentioned
he
concludes
that
his
kinsfolk
are
not
mourning
for
him
properly
if
their
grief
were
genuine
they
could
not
bear
to
bandy
his
name
about
touched
to
the
quick
by
their
indifference
the
indignant
ghost
will
come
and
trouble
them
in
dreams
in
these
tribes
no
woman
may
ever
again
mention
the
name
of
a
dead
person
but
the
restriction
on
the
male
sex
is
not
so
absolute
for
the
name
may
be
mentioned
by
men
of
the
two
subclasses
to
which
the
wife
s
father
and
wife
s
brother
of
the
deceased
belong
among
some
tribes
of
australia
a
dead
man
s
name
is
never
mentioned
after
his
burial
and
he
is
only
spoken
of
as
that
one
otherwise
they
think
that
he
would
return
and
frighten
them
at
night
in
camp
the
same
reluctance
to
utter
the
names
of
the
dead
appears
to
prevail
among
all
the
indian
tribes
of
america
from
hudson
s
bay
territory
to
patagonia
among
the
iroquois
for
example
the
name
of
the
deceased
was
never
mentioned
after
the
period
of
mourning
had
expired
the
same
rule
was
rigidly
observed
by
the
indians
of
california
and
oregon
its
transgression
might
be
punished
with
a
heavy
fine
or
even
with
death
thus
among
the
karok
of
california
we
are
told
that
the
highest
crime
one
can
commit
is
the
the
mere
mention
of
the
dead
relative
s
name
it
is
a
deadly
insult
to
the
survivors
and
can
be
atoned
for
only
by
the
same
amount
of
paid
for
wilful
murder
in
default
of
that
they
will
have
the
villain
s
amongst
the
wintun
also
of
california
if
some
one
in
a
group
of
merry
talkers
inadvertently
mentions
the
name
of
a
deceased
person
straightway
there
falls
upon
all
an
awful
silence
no
words
can
describe
the
shuddering
and
terror
which
seizes
upon
them
at
the
utterance
of
that
fearful
among
the
goajiros
of
colombia
to
mention
the
dead
before
his
kinsmen
is
a
dreadful
offence
which
is
often
punished
with
death
for
if
it
happen
on
the
of
the
deceased
in
presence
of
his
nephew
or
uncle
they
will
assuredly
kill
the
offender
on
the
spot
if
they
can
but
if
he
escapes
the
penalty
resolves
itself
into
a
heavy
fine
usually
of
two
or
more
oxen
so
among
the
abipones
of
paraguay
to
mention
the
departed
by
name
was
a
serious
crime
which
often
led
to
blows
and
bloodshed
when
it
was
needful
to
refer
to
such
an
one
it
was
done
by
means
of
a
general
phrase
such
as
he
who
is
no
more
eked
out
with
particulars
which
served
to
identify
the
person
meant
a
similar
reluctance
to
mention
the
names
of
the
dead
is
reported
of
peoples
so
widely
separated
from
each
other
as
the
samoyeds
of
siberia
and
the
todas
of
southern
india
the
mongols
of
tartary
and
the
tuaregs
of
the
sahara
the
ainos
of
japan
and
the
akamba
and
nandi
of
central
africa
the
tinguianes
of
the
philippines
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
nicobar
islands
of
borneo
of
madagascar
and
of
tasmania
in
all
cases
even
where
it
is
not
expressly
stated
the
fundamental
reason
for
this
avoidance
is
probably
the
fear
of
the
ghost
that
this
is
the
real
motive
with
the
tuaregs
of
the
sahara
we
are
positively
informed
they
dread
the
return
of
the
dead
man
s
spirit
and
do
all
they
can
to
avoid
it
by
shifting
their
camp
after
a
death
ceasing
for
ever
to
pronounce
the
name
of
the
departed
and
eschewing
everything
that
might
be
regarded
as
an
evocation
or
recall
of
his
soul
hence
they
do
not
like
the
arabs
designate
individuals
by
adding
to
their
personal
names
the
names
of
their
fathers
they
never
speak
of
son
of
they
give
to
every
man
a
name
which
will
live
and
die
with
him
so
among
some
of
the
victorian
tribes
in
australia
personal
names
were
rarely
perpetuated
because
the
natives
believed
that
any
one
who
adopted
the
name
of
a
deceased
person
would
not
live
long
probably
his
ghostly
namesake
was
supposed
to
come
and
fetch
him
away
to
the
the
yabims
of
german
new
guinea
who
believe
that
the
spirits
of
the
dead
pass
their
time
in
the
forest
eating
unpalatable
fruits
are
unwilling
to
mention
the
names
of
the
deceased
lest
their
ghosts
should
suspend
their
habitual
occupation
to
come
and
trouble
the
living
in
logea
one
of
the
samarai
archipelago
off
the
end
of
new
guinea
no
custom
is
observed
so
strictly
as
the
one
which
forbids
the
naming
of
the
dead
in
presence
of
their
relations
to
say
to
a
person
your
fathers
are
dead
is
considered
a
direct
challenge
to
fight
it
is
an
insult
which
must
be
avenged
either
by
the
death
of
the
man
who
pronounced
these
awful
words
or
by
the
death
of
one
of
his
relatives
or
friends
the
uttering
of
the
names
of
the
dead
is
along
with
homicide
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
war
in
the
island
when
it
is
necessary
to
refer
to
a
dead
man
they
designate
him
by
such
a
phrase
as
the
father
of
or
the
brother
of
thus
the
fear
of
mentioning
the
names
of
the
dead
gives
rise
to
circumlocutions
of
precisely
the
same
sort
as
those
which
originate
in
a
reluctance
to
name
living
people
among
the
klallam
indians
of
washington
state
no
person
may
bear
the
name
of
his
deceased
father
grandfather
or
any
other
direct
ancestor
in
the
paternal
line
the
masai
of
eastern
africa
are
said
to
resort
to
a
simple
device
which
enables
them
to
speak
of
the
dead
freely
without
risk
of
the
inopportune
appearance
of
the
ghost
as
soon
as
a
man
or
woman
dies
they
change
his
or
her
name
and
henceforth
always
speak
of
him
or
her
by
the
new
name
while
the
old
name
falls
into
oblivion
and
to
utter
it
in
the
presence
of
a
kinsman
of
the
deceased
is
an
insult
which
calls
for
vengeance
they
assume
that
the
dead
man
will
not
know
his
new
name
and
so
will
not
answer
to
it
when
he
hears
it
pronounced
ghosts
are
notoriously
nothing
is
easier
than
to
dupe
them
however
according
to
another
and
more
probable
account
the
name
of
a
masai
is
not
changed
after
his
death
it
is
merely
suppressed
and
he
or
she
is
referred
to
by
a
descriptive
phrase
such
as
my
brother
my
uncle
my
to
call
a
dead
man
by
his
name
is
deemed
most
unlucky
and
is
never
done
except
with
the
intention
of
doing
harm
to
his
surviving
family
who
make
great
lamentations
on
such
an
occasion
the
same
fear
of
the
ghost
which
moves
people
to
suppress
his
old
name
naturally
leads
all
persons
who
bear
a
similar
name
to
exchange
it
for
another
lest
its
utterance
should
attract
the
attention
of
the
ghost
who
can
not
reasonably
be
expected
to
discriminate
between
all
the
different
applications
of
the
same
name
thus
we
are
told
that
in
the
adelaide
and
encounter
bay
tribes
of
south
australia
the
repugnance
to
mentioning
the
names
of
those
who
have
died
lately
is
carried
so
far
that
persons
who
bear
the
same
name
as
the
deceased
abandon
it
and
either
adopt
temporary
names
or
are
known
by
any
others
that
happen
to
belong
to
them
the
same
practice
was
observed
by
the
aborigines
of
new
south
wales
and
is
said
to
be
observed
by
the
tribes
of
the
lower
murray
river
and
of
king
george
s
sound
in
western
australia
a
similar
custom
prevails
among
some
of
the
queensland
tribes
but
the
prohibition
to
use
the
names
of
the
dead
is
not
permanent
though
it
may
last
for
many
years
on
the
bloomfield
river
when
a
namesake
dies
the
survivor
is
called
tanyu
a
word
whose
meaning
is
unknown
or
else
he
or
she
receives
a
name
which
refers
to
the
corpse
with
the
syllable
wau
prefixed
to
it
for
example
he
may
be
called
with
reference
to
the
place
where
the
man
was
buried
or
burnt
with
reference
to
the
cremation
of
the
body
and
if
there
should
be
several
people
in
camp
all
bearing
one
of
these
allusive
designations
they
are
distinguished
from
each
other
by
the
mention
of
the
names
of
their
mothers
or
other
relatives
even
though
these
last
have
long
been
dead
and
gone
whenever
roth
to
whom
we
owe
this
information
could
obtain
an
explanation
of
the
custom
the
reason
invariably
assigned
was
a
fear
that
the
ghost
hearing
himself
called
by
name
might
return
and
cause
mischief
in
some
australian
tribes
the
change
of
name
thus
brought
about
is
permanent
the
old
name
is
laid
aside
for
ever
and
the
man
is
known
by
his
new
name
for
the
rest
of
his
life
or
at
least
until
he
is
obliged
to
change
it
again
for
a
like
reason
among
the
north
american
indians
all
persons
whether
men
or
women
who
bore
the
name
of
one
who
had
just
died
were
obliged
to
abandon
it
and
to
adopt
other
names
which
was
formally
done
at
the
first
ceremony
of
mourning
for
the
dead
in
some
tribes
to
the
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
this
change
of
name
lasted
only
during
the
season
of
mourning
but
in
other
tribes
on
the
pacific
coast
of
north
america
it
seems
to
have
been
permanent
amongst
the
masai
also
when
two
men
of
the
same
tribe
bear
the
same
name
and
one
of
them
dies
the
survivor
changes
his
name
sometimes
by
an
extension
of
the
same
reasoning
all
the
near
relations
of
the
deceased
change
their
names
whatever
they
may
happen
to
be
doubtless
from
a
fear
that
the
sound
of
the
familiar
names
might
lure
back
the
vagrant
spirit
to
its
old
home
thus
in
some
victorian
tribes
the
ordinary
names
of
all
the
next
of
kin
were
disused
during
the
period
of
mourning
and
certain
general
terms
prescribed
by
custom
were
substituted
for
them
to
call
a
mourner
by
his
own
name
was
considered
an
insult
to
the
departed
and
often
led
to
fighting
and
bloodshed
among
indian
tribes
of
america
near
relations
of
the
deceased
often
change
their
names
under
an
impression
that
spirits
will
be
attracted
back
to
earth
if
they
hear
familiar
names
often
among
the
kiowa
indians
the
name
of
the
dead
is
never
spoken
in
the
presence
of
the
relatives
and
on
the
death
of
any
member
of
a
family
all
the
others
take
new
names
this
custom
was
noted
by
raleigh
s
colonists
on
roanoke
island
more
than
three
centuries
ago
among
the
lengua
indians
of
the
gran
chaco
in
south
america
not
only
is
a
dead
man
s
name
never
mentioned
but
all
the
survivors
change
their
names
also
they
say
that
death
has
been
among
them
and
has
carried
off
a
list
of
the
living
and
that
he
will
soon
come
back
for
more
victims
hence
in
order
to
defeat
his
fell
purpose
they
change
their
names
believing
that
on
his
return
death
though
he
has
got
them
all
on
his
list
will
not
be
able
to
identify
them
under
their
new
names
and
will
depart
to
pursue
the
search
elsewhere
so
among
the
guaycurus
of
the
gran
chaco
when
a
death
had
taken
place
the
chief
used
to
change
the
names
of
every
person
in
the
tribe
man
and
woman
young
and
old
and
it
is
said
to
have
been
wonderful
to
observe
how
from
that
moment
everybody
remembered
his
new
name
just
as
if
he
had
borne
it
all
his
life
nicobarese
mourners
take
new
names
in
order
to
escape
the
unwelcome
attentions
of
the
ghost
and
for
the
same
purpose
they
disguise
themselves
by
shaving
their
heads
so
that
the
ghost
is
unable
to
recognise
them
the
chukchees
of
bering
strait
believe
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
turn
into
malignant
spirits
who
seek
to
harm
the
living
hence
when
a
mother
dies
the
name
of
her
youngest
and
dearest
child
is
changed
in
order
that
her
ghost
may
not
know
the
child
further
when
the
name
of
the
deceased
happens
to
be
that
of
some
common
object
such
as
an
animal
or
plant
or
fire
or
water
it
is
sometimes
considered
necessary
to
drop
that
word
in
ordinary
speech
and
replace
it
by
another
a
custom
of
this
sort
it
is
plain
may
easily
be
a
potent
agent
of
change
in
language
for
where
it
prevails
to
any
considerable
extent
many
words
must
constantly
become
obsolete
and
new
ones
spring
up
and
this
tendency
has
been
remarked
by
observers
who
have
recorded
the
custom
in
australia
america
and
elsewhere
for
example
with
regard
to
the
australian
aborigines
it
has
been
noted
that
the
dialects
change
with
almost
every
tribe
some
tribes
name
their
children
after
natural
objects
and
when
the
person
so
named
dies
the
word
is
never
again
mentioned
another
word
has
therefore
to
be
invented
for
the
object
after
which
the
child
was
the
writer
gives
as
an
instance
the
case
of
a
man
whose
name
karla
signified
fire
when
karla
died
a
new
word
for
fire
had
to
be
introduced
hence
adds
the
writer
the
language
is
always
in
the
moorunde
tribe
the
name
for
teal
used
to
be
but
when
a
boy
called
torpool
died
a
new
name
was
given
to
the
bird
and
the
old
name
dropped
out
altogether
from
the
language
of
the
tribe
sometimes
however
such
substitutes
for
common
words
were
only
in
vogue
for
a
limited
time
after
the
death
and
were
then
discarded
in
favour
of
the
old
words
thus
among
the
kowraregas
of
the
prince
of
wales
islands
and
the
gudangs
of
cape
york
in
queensland
the
names
of
the
dead
are
never
mentioned
without
great
reluctance
so
that
for
example
when
a
man
named
us
or
quartz
died
the
name
of
the
stone
was
changed
to
the
thing
which
is
a
namesake
but
the
original
word
would
gradually
return
to
common
use
again
a
missionary
who
lived
among
the
victorian
aborigines
remarks
that
it
is
customary
among
these
blacks
to
disuse
a
word
when
a
person
has
died
whose
name
was
the
same
or
even
of
the
same
sound
i
find
great
difficulty
in
getting
blacks
to
repeat
such
words
i
believe
this
custom
is
common
to
all
the
victorian
tribes
though
in
course
of
time
the
word
is
resumed
again
i
have
seen
among
the
murray
blacks
the
dead
freely
spoken
of
when
they
have
been
dead
some
again
in
the
encounter
bay
tribe
of
south
australia
if
a
man
of
the
name
of
ngnke
which
means
water
were
to
die
the
whole
tribe
would
be
obliged
to
use
some
other
word
to
express
water
for
a
considerable
time
after
his
decease
the
writer
who
records
this
custom
surmises
that
it
may
explain
the
presence
of
a
number
of
synonyms
in
the
language
of
the
tribe
this
conjecture
is
confirmed
by
what
we
know
of
some
victorian
tribes
whose
speech
comprised
a
regular
set
of
synonyms
to
be
used
instead
of
the
common
terms
by
all
members
of
a
tribe
in
times
of
mourning
for
instance
if
a
man
called
waa
crow
departed
this
life
during
the
period
of
mourning
for
him
nobody
might
call
a
crow
a
everybody
had
to
speak
of
the
bird
as
a
when
a
person
who
rejoiced
in
the
title
of
ringtail
opossum
had
gone
the
way
of
all
flesh
his
sorrowing
relations
and
the
tribe
at
large
were
bound
for
a
time
to
refer
to
ringtail
opossums
by
the
more
sonorous
name
of
if
the
community
were
plunged
in
grief
for
the
loss
of
a
respected
female
who
bore
the
honourable
name
of
turkey
bustard
the
proper
name
for
turkey
bustards
which
was
went
out
and
came
in
and
so
with
the
names
of
black
cockatoo
grey
duck
gigantic
crane
kangaroo
eagle
dingo
and
the
rest
a
similar
custom
used
to
be
constantly
transforming
the
language
of
the
abipones
of
paraguay
amongst
whom
however
a
word
once
abolished
seems
never
to
have
been
revived
new
words
says
the
missionary
dobrizhoffer
sprang
up
every
year
like
mushrooms
in
a
night
because
all
words
that
resembled
the
names
of
the
dead
were
abolished
by
proclamation
and
others
coined
in
their
place
the
mint
of
words
was
in
the
hands
of
the
old
women
of
the
tribe
and
whatever
term
they
stamped
with
their
approval
and
put
in
circulation
was
immediately
accepted
without
a
murmur
by
high
and
low
alike
and
spread
like
wildfire
through
every
camp
and
settlement
of
the
tribe
you
would
be
astonished
says
the
same
missionary
to
see
how
meekly
the
whole
nation
acquiesces
in
the
decision
of
a
withered
old
hag
and
how
completely
the
old
familiar
words
fall
instantly
out
of
use
and
are
never
repeated
either
through
force
of
habit
or
forgetfulness
in
the
seven
years
that
dobrizhoffer
spent
among
these
indians
the
native
word
for
jaguar
was
changed
thrice
and
the
words
for
crocodile
thorn
and
the
slaughter
of
cattle
underwent
similar
though
less
varied
vicissitudes
as
a
result
of
this
habit
the
vocabularies
of
the
missionaries
teemed
with
erasures
old
words
having
constantly
to
be
struck
out
as
obsolete
and
new
ones
inserted
in
their
place
similarly
a
peculiar
feature
of
the
comanche
language
is
that
a
portion
of
the
vocabulary
is
continually
changing
if
for
example
a
person
called
eagle
or
bison
dies
a
new
name
is
invented
for
the
bird
or
beast
because
it
is
forbidden
to
mention
the
name
of
any
one
who
is
dead
so
amongst
the
kiowa
indians
all
words
that
suggest
the
name
of
a
deceased
person
are
dropped
for
a
term
of
years
and
other
words
are
substituted
for
them
the
old
word
may
after
the
lapse
of
years
be
restored
but
it
often
happens
that
the
new
one
keeps
its
place
and
the
original
word
is
entirely
forgotten
old
men
sometimes
remember
as
many
as
three
different
names
which
have
been
successively
used
for
the
same
thing
the
new
word
is
commonly
a
novel
combination
of
existing
roots
or
a
novel
use
of
a
current
word
rather
than
a
deliberately
invented
term
the
basagala
a
people
to
the
west
of
uganda
cease
to
use
a
word
if
it
was
the
name
of
an
influential
person
who
has
died
for
example
after
the
death
of
a
chief
named
mwenda
which
means
nine
the
name
for
the
numeral
was
changed
on
the
death
of
a
child
or
a
warrior
or
a
woman
amongst
the
masai
the
body
is
thrown
away
and
the
person
s
name
is
buried
it
is
never
again
mentioned
by
the
family
should
there
be
anything
which
is
called
by
that
name
it
is
given
another
name
which
is
not
like
that
of
the
deceased
for
instance
if
an
unimportant
person
called
he
who
is
soft
or
weak
or
gentle
were
to
die
gentleness
would
not
be
called
in
that
kraal
but
it
would
be
called
by
another
name
such
as
it
is
smooth
if
an
elder
dies
leaving
children
his
name
is
not
buried
for
his
descendants
are
named
after
from
this
statement
which
is
translated
from
a
native
account
in
the
masai
language
we
may
perhaps
infer
that
among
the
masai
it
is
as
a
rule
only
the
childless
dead
whose
names
are
avoided
in
the
island
of
buru
it
is
unlawful
to
mention
the
names
of
the
dead
or
any
words
that
resemble
them
in
sound
in
many
tribes
of
british
new
guinea
the
names
of
persons
are
also
the
names
of
common
things
the
people
believe
that
if
the
name
of
a
deceased
person
is
pronounced
his
spirit
will
return
and
as
they
have
no
wish
to
see
it
back
among
them
the
mention
of
his
name
is
tabooed
and
a
new
word
is
created
to
take
its
place
whenever
the
name
happens
to
be
a
common
term
of
the
language
thus
at
near
the
extremity
of
new
guinea
the
names
of
the
dead
become
taboo
immediately
after
death
and
if
they
are
as
generally
happens
the
names
of
common
objects
new
words
must
be
adopted
for
these
things
and
the
old
words
are
dropped
from
the
language
so
long
at
least
as
the
memory
of
the
dead
survives
for
example
when
a
man
died
whose
name
binama
meant
hornbill
a
new
name
literally
the
plasterer
was
adopted
for
the
bird
consequently
many
words
are
permanently
lost
or
revived
with
modified
or
new
meanings
the
frequent
changes
of
vocabulary
caused
by
this
custom
are
very
inconvenient
and
nowadays
the
practice
of
using
foreign
words
as
substitutes
is
coming
more
and
more
into
vogue
english
profanity
now
contributes
its
share
to
the
language
of
these
savages
in
the
caroline
islands
the
ordinary
name
for
pig
is
but
in
the
paliker
district
of
ponape
the
pig
is
called
not
but
or
the
animal
that
grubs
in
the
soil
for
the
word
was
there
tabooed
after
the
death
of
a
man
named
puik
this
is
a
living
instance
showing
how
under
our
very
eyes
old
words
are
dropping
out
of
use
in
these
isolated
dialects
and
new
ones
are
taking
their
in
the
nicobar
islands
a
similar
practice
has
similarly
affected
the
speech
of
the
natives
a
most
singular
custom
says
de
roepstorff
prevails
among
them
which
one
would
suppose
must
most
effectually
hinder
the
making
of
history
or
at
any
rate
the
transmission
of
historical
narrative
by
a
strict
rule
which
has
all
the
sanction
of
nicobar
superstition
no
man
s
name
may
be
mentioned
after
his
death
to
such
a
length
is
this
carried
that
when
as
very
frequently
happens
the
man
rejoiced
in
the
name
of
fowl
hat
fire
road
in
its
nicobarese
equivalent
the
use
of
these
words
is
carefully
eschewed
for
the
future
not
only
as
being
the
personal
designation
of
the
deceased
but
even
as
the
names
of
the
common
things
they
represent
the
words
die
out
of
the
language
and
either
new
vocables
are
coined
to
express
the
thing
intended
or
a
substitute
for
the
disused
word
is
found
in
other
nicobarese
dialects
or
in
some
foreign
tongue
this
extraordinary
custom
not
only
adds
an
element
of
instability
to
the
language
but
destroys
the
continuity
of
political
life
and
renders
the
record
of
past
events
precarious
and
vague
if
not
that
a
superstition
which
suppresses
the
names
of
the
dead
must
cut
at
the
very
root
of
historical
tradition
has
been
remarked
by
other
workers
in
this
field
the
klamath
people
observes
gatschet
possess
no
historic
traditions
going
further
back
in
time
than
a
century
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
was
a
strict
law
prohibiting
the
mention
of
the
person
or
acts
of
a
deceased
individual
by
his
this
law
was
rigidly
observed
among
the
californians
no
less
than
among
the
oregonians
and
on
its
transgression
the
death
penalty
could
be
inflicted
this
is
certainly
enough
to
suppress
all
historical
knowledge
within
a
people
how
can
history
be
written
without
names
among
some
of
the
tribes
of
new
south
wales
the
simple
ditties
never
more
than
two
lines
long
to
which
the
natives
dance
are
never
transmitted
from
one
generation
to
another
because
when
the
rude
poet
dies
all
the
songs
of
which
he
was
author
are
as
it
were
buried
with
him
inasmuch
as
they
in
common
with
his
very
name
are
studiously
ignored
from
thenceforward
consequently
they
are
quite
forgotten
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
indeed
this
custom
of
endeavouring
persistently
to
forget
everything
which
had
been
in
any
way
connected
with
the
dead
entirely
precludes
the
possibility
of
anything
of
an
historical
nature
having
existence
amongst
them
in
fact
the
most
vital
occurrence
if
only
dating
a
single
generation
back
is
quite
forgotten
that
is
to
say
if
the
recounting
thereof
should
necessitate
the
mention
of
a
defunct
aboriginal
s
thus
among
these
simple
savages
even
a
sacred
bard
could
not
avail
to
rescue
an
australian
agamemnon
from
the
long
night
of
oblivion
in
many
tribes
however
the
power
of
this
superstition
to
blot
out
the
memory
of
the
past
is
to
some
extent
weakened
and
impaired
by
a
natural
tendency
of
the
human
mind
time
which
wears
out
the
deepest
impressions
inevitably
dulls
if
it
does
not
wholly
efface
the
print
left
on
the
savage
mind
by
the
mystery
and
horror
of
death
sooner
or
later
as
the
memory
of
his
loved
ones
fades
slowly
away
he
becomes
more
willing
to
speak
of
them
and
thus
their
rude
names
may
sometimes
be
rescued
by
the
philosophic
enquirer
before
they
have
vanished
like
autumn
leaves
or
winter
snows
into
the
vast
undistinguished
limbo
of
the
past
this
was
sir
george
grey
s
experience
when
he
attempted
to
trace
the
intricate
system
of
kinship
prevalent
among
the
natives
of
western
australia
he
says
it
is
impossible
for
any
person
not
well
acquainted
with
the
language
of
the
natives
and
who
does
not
possess
great
personal
influence
over
them
to
pursue
an
inquiry
of
this
nature
for
one
of
the
customs
most
rigidly
observed
and
enforced
amongst
them
is
never
to
mention
the
name
of
a
deceased
person
male
or
female
in
an
inquiry
therefore
which
principally
turns
upon
the
names
of
their
ancestors
this
prejudice
must
be
every
moment
violated
and
a
very
great
difficulty
encountered
in
the
outset
the
only
circumstance
which
at
all
enabled
me
to
overcome
this
was
that
the
longer
a
person
has
been
dead
the
less
repugnance
do
they
evince
in
uttering
his
name
i
therefore
in
the
first
instance
endeavoured
to
ascertain
only
the
oldest
names
on
record
and
on
subsequent
occasions
when
i
found
a
native
alone
and
in
a
loquacious
humour
i
succeeded
in
filling
up
some
of
the
blanks
occasionally
round
their
fires
at
night
i
managed
to
involve
them
in
disputes
regarding
their
ancestors
and
on
these
occasions
gleaned
much
of
the
information
of
which
i
was
in
in
some
of
the
victorian
tribes
the
prohibition
to
mention
the
names
of
the
dead
remained
in
force
only
during
the
period
of
mourning
in
the
port
lincoln
tribe
of
south
australia
it
lasted
many
years
among
the
chinook
indians
of
north
america
custom
forbids
the
mention
of
a
dead
man
s
name
at
least
till
many
years
have
elapsed
after
the
in
the
twana
chemakum
and
klallam
tribes
of
washington
state
the
names
of
deceased
members
may
be
mentioned
two
or
three
years
after
their
death
among
the
puyallup
indians
the
observance
of
the
taboo
is
relaxed
after
several
years
when
the
mourners
have
forgotten
their
grief
and
if
the
deceased
was
a
famous
warrior
one
of
his
descendants
for
instance
a
may
be
named
after
him
in
this
tribe
the
taboo
is
not
much
observed
at
any
time
except
by
the
relations
of
the
dead
similarly
the
jesuit
missionary
lafitau
tells
us
that
the
name
of
the
departed
and
the
similar
names
of
the
survivors
were
so
to
say
buried
with
the
corpse
until
the
poignancy
of
their
grief
being
abated
it
pleased
the
relations
to
lift
up
the
tree
and
raise
the
by
raising
the
dead
they
meant
bestowing
the
name
of
the
departed
upon
some
one
else
who
thus
became
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
reincarnation
of
the
deceased
since
on
the
principles
of
savage
philosophy
the
name
is
a
vital
part
if
not
the
soul
of
the
man
when
father
lafitau
arrived
at
louis
to
begin
work
among
the
iroquois
his
colleagues
decided
that
in
order
to
make
a
favourable
impression
on
his
flock
the
new
shepherd
should
assume
the
native
name
of
his
deceased
predecessor
father
brüyas
the
celebrated
missionary
who
had
lived
many
years
among
the
indians
and
enjoyed
their
high
esteem
but
father
brüyas
had
been
called
from
his
earthly
labours
to
his
heavenly
rest
only
four
short
months
before
and
it
was
too
soon
in
the
phraseology
of
the
iroquois
to
raise
up
the
however
raised
up
it
was
in
spite
of
them
and
though
some
bolder
spirits
protested
that
their
new
pastor
had
wronged
them
by
taking
the
name
of
his
predecessor
nevertheless
says
father
lafitau
they
did
not
fail
to
regard
me
as
himself
in
another
form
autre
since
i
had
entered
into
all
his
the
same
mode
of
bringing
a
dead
man
to
life
again
by
bestowing
his
name
upon
a
living
person
was
practised
by
the
hurons
and
other
indian
tribes
of
canada
an
early
french
traveller
in
canada
has
described
the
ceremony
of
resurrection
as
it
was
observed
by
a
tribe
whom
he
calls
the
attiuoindarons
he
says
the
attiuoindarons
practise
resurrections
of
the
dead
principally
of
persons
who
have
deserved
well
of
their
country
by
their
remarkable
services
so
that
the
memory
of
illustrious
and
valiant
men
revives
in
a
certain
way
in
others
accordingly
they
call
assemblies
for
this
purpose
and
hold
councils
at
which
they
choose
one
of
them
who
has
the
same
virtues
and
qualities
if
possible
as
he
had
whom
they
wish
to
resuscitate
or
at
least
he
must
be
of
irreproachable
life
judged
by
the
standard
of
a
savage
people
wishing
then
to
proceed
to
the
resurrection
they
all
stand
up
except
him
who
is
to
be
resuscitated
to
whom
they
give
the
name
of
the
deceased
and
all
letting
their
hands
down
very
low
they
pretend
to
lift
him
up
from
the
earth
intending
by
that
to
signify
that
they
draw
the
great
personage
deceased
from
the
grave
and
restore
him
to
life
in
the
person
of
this
other
who
stands
up
and
after
great
acclamations
of
the
people
receives
the
presents
which
the
bystanders
offer
him
they
further
hold
several
feasts
in
his
honour
and
regard
him
thenceforth
as
the
deceased
whom
he
represents
and
by
this
means
the
memory
of
virtuous
men
and
of
good
and
valiant
captains
never
dies
among
among
the
hurons
the
ceremony
took
place
between
the
death
and
the
great
festival
of
the
dead
which
was
usually
celebrated
at
intervals
of
twelve
years
when
it
was
resolved
to
resuscitate
a
departed
warrior
the
members
of
his
family
met
and
decided
which
of
them
was
to
be
regarded
as
an
incarnation
of
the
deceased
if
the
dead
man
had
been
a
famous
chief
and
leader
in
war
his
living
representative
and
namesake
succeeded
to
his
functions
presents
were
made
to
him
and
he
entertained
the
whole
tribe
at
a
magnificent
banquet
his
old
robes
were
taken
from
him
and
he
was
clad
in
richer
raiment
thereupon
a
herald
proclaimed
aloud
the
mystery
of
the
incarnation
let
all
the
people
he
said
remain
silent
open
your
ears
and
shut
your
mouths
that
which
i
am
about
to
say
is
of
importance
our
business
is
to
resuscitate
a
dead
man
and
to
bring
a
great
captain
to
life
with
that
he
named
the
dead
man
and
all
his
posterity
and
reminded
his
hearers
of
the
place
and
manner
of
his
death
then
turning
to
him
who
was
to
succeed
the
departed
he
lifted
up
his
voice
behold
him
he
cried
clad
in
this
beautiful
robe
it
is
not
he
whom
you
saw
these
past
days
who
was
called
nehap
he
has
given
his
name
to
another
and
he
himself
is
now
called
etouait
the
name
of
the
defunct
look
on
him
as
the
true
captain
of
this
nation
it
is
he
whom
you
are
bound
to
obey
it
is
he
whom
you
are
bound
to
listen
to
it
is
he
whom
you
are
bound
to
the
new
incarnation
meanwhile
maintained
a
dignified
silence
and
afterwards
led
the
young
braves
out
to
war
in
order
to
prove
that
he
had
inherited
the
courage
and
virtues
as
well
as
the
name
of
the
dead
chief
the
carrier
indians
of
british
columbia
firmly
believe
that
a
departed
soul
can
if
it
pleases
come
back
to
the
earth
in
a
human
shape
or
body
in
order
to
see
his
friends
who
are
still
alive
therefore
as
they
are
about
to
set
fire
to
the
pile
of
wood
on
which
a
corpse
is
laid
a
relation
of
the
deceased
person
stands
at
his
feet
and
asks
him
if
he
will
ever
come
back
among
them
then
the
priest
or
magician
with
a
grave
countenance
stands
at
the
head
of
the
corpse
and
looks
through
both
his
hands
on
its
naked
breast
and
then
raises
them
toward
heaven
and
blows
through
them
as
they
say
the
soul
of
the
deceased
that
it
may
go
and
find
and
enter
into
a
relative
or
if
any
relative
is
present
the
priest
will
hold
both
his
hands
on
the
head
of
this
person
and
blow
through
them
that
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
may
enter
into
him
or
her
and
then
as
they
affirm
the
first
child
which
this
person
has
will
possess
the
soul
of
the
deceased
the
writer
does
not
say
that
the
infant
took
the
name
of
the
deceased
who
was
born
again
in
it
but
probably
it
did
for
sometimes
the
priest
would
transfer
the
soul
from
a
dead
to
a
living
person
who
in
that
case
took
the
name
of
the
departed
in
addition
to
his
own
among
the
lapps
when
a
woman
was
with
child
and
near
the
time
of
her
delivery
a
deceased
ancestor
or
relation
known
as
a
used
to
appear
to
her
in
a
dream
and
inform
her
what
dead
person
was
to
be
born
again
in
her
infant
and
whose
name
the
child
was
therefore
to
bear
if
the
woman
had
no
such
dream
it
fell
to
the
father
or
the
relatives
to
determine
the
name
by
divination
or
by
consulting
a
wizard
among
the
khonds
a
birth
is
celebrated
on
the
seventh
day
after
the
event
by
a
feast
given
to
the
priest
and
to
the
whole
village
to
determine
the
child
s
name
the
priest
drops
grains
of
rice
into
a
cup
of
water
naming
with
each
grain
a
deceased
ancestor
from
the
movements
of
the
seed
in
the
water
and
from
observations
made
on
the
person
of
the
infant
he
pronounces
which
of
his
progenitors
has
reappeared
in
him
and
the
child
generally
at
least
among
the
northern
tribes
receives
the
name
of
that
ancestor
among
the
peoples
of
togo
in
west
africa
when
a
woman
is
in
hard
labour
a
fetish
priest
or
priestess
is
called
in
to
disclose
the
name
of
the
deceased
relative
who
has
just
been
born
again
into
the
world
in
the
person
of
the
infant
the
name
of
that
relative
is
bestowed
on
the
child
among
the
yorubas
soon
after
a
child
has
been
born
a
priest
of
ifa
the
god
of
divination
appears
on
the
scene
to
ascertain
what
ancestral
soul
has
been
reborn
in
the
infant
as
soon
as
this
has
been
decided
the
parents
are
told
that
the
child
must
conform
in
all
respects
to
the
manner
of
life
of
the
ancestor
who
now
animates
him
or
her
and
if
as
often
happens
they
profess
ignorance
the
priest
supplies
the
necessary
information
the
child
usually
receives
the
name
of
the
ancestor
who
has
been
born
again
in
him
in
uganda
a
child
is
named
with
much
ceremony
by
its
grandfather
who
bestows
on
it
the
name
of
one
of
its
ancestors
but
never
the
name
of
its
father
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
namesake
then
enters
the
child
and
assists
him
through
life
here
the
reincarnation
of
the
ancestor
appears
to
be
effected
by
giving
his
name
and
with
it
his
soul
to
his
descendant
the
same
idea
seems
to
explain
a
curious
ceremony
observed
by
the
makalaka
of
south
africa
at
the
naming
of
a
child
the
spirit
of
the
ancestor
whose
name
the
child
is
to
bear
is
represented
by
an
elderly
kinsman
or
kinswoman
according
as
the
little
one
is
a
boy
or
a
girl
a
pretence
is
made
of
catching
the
representative
of
the
spirit
and
dragging
him
or
her
to
the
hut
of
the
child
s
parents
outside
the
hut
the
pretended
spirit
takes
his
seat
and
the
skin
of
an
animal
is
thrown
over
him
he
then
washes
his
hands
in
a
vessel
of
water
eats
some
and
washes
it
down
with
beer
meantime
the
women
and
girls
dance
gleefully
round
him
screaming
or
singing
and
throw
copper
rings
beads
and
so
forth
as
presents
into
the
vessel
of
water
the
men
do
the
same
but
without
dancing
after
that
they
enter
the
hut
to
partake
of
a
feast
the
representative
of
the
ancestral
spirit
now
vanishes
and
the
child
thenceforth
bears
his
or
her
name
this
ceremony
may
be
intended
to
represent
the
reincarnation
of
the
ancestral
spirit
in
the
child
in
the
nicobar
islands
the
names
of
dead
relatives
are
tabooed
for
a
generation
but
when
both
their
parents
are
dead
men
and
women
are
bound
to
assume
the
names
of
their
deceased
grandfathers
or
grandmothers
respectively
perhaps
with
the
names
they
may
be
thought
to
inherit
the
spirits
of
their
ancestors
among
the
tartars
in
the
middle
ages
the
names
of
the
dead
might
not
be
uttered
till
the
third
generation
among
the
gilyaks
of
saghalien
no
two
persons
in
the
same
tribe
may
bear
the
same
name
at
the
same
time
for
they
think
that
if
a
child
were
to
receive
the
name
of
a
living
man
either
the
child
or
the
man
would
die
within
the
year
when
a
man
dies
his
name
may
not
be
uttered
until
after
the
celebration
of
the
festival
at
which
they
sacrifice
a
bear
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
plenty
of
game
and
fish
at
that
festival
they
call
out
the
name
of
the
deceased
while
they
beat
the
skin
of
the
bear
thenceforth
the
name
may
be
pronounced
by
every
one
and
it
will
be
bestowed
on
a
child
who
shall
afterwards
be
born
these
customs
suggest
that
the
gilyaks
like
other
peoples
suppose
the
namesake
of
a
deceased
person
to
be
his
or
her
reincarnation
for
their
objection
to
let
two
living
persons
bear
the
same
name
seems
to
imply
a
belief
that
the
soul
goes
with
the
name
and
therefore
can
not
be
shared
by
two
people
at
the
same
time
among
the
esquimaux
of
bering
strait
the
first
child
born
in
a
village
after
some
one
has
died
receives
the
dead
person
s
name
and
must
represent
him
in
subsequent
festivals
which
are
given
in
his
honour
the
day
before
the
great
feast
of
the
dead
the
nearest
male
relative
of
the
deceased
goes
to
the
grave
and
plants
before
it
a
stake
bearing
the
crest
or
badge
of
the
departed
this
is
the
notice
served
to
the
ghost
to
attend
the
festival
accordingly
he
returns
from
the
to
the
grave
afterwards
a
song
is
sung
at
the
grave
inviting
the
ghost
to
repair
to
the
where
the
people
are
gathered
to
celebrate
the
festival
the
shade
accepts
the
invitation
and
takes
his
place
with
the
other
ghosts
in
the
under
the
floor
of
the
all
the
time
of
the
festival
which
lasts
for
several
days
lamps
filled
with
are
kept
burning
day
and
night
in
the
in
order
to
light
up
the
path
to
the
and
enable
the
ghosts
to
find
their
way
back
to
their
old
haunts
on
earth
when
the
spirits
of
the
dead
are
gathered
in
the
pit
and
the
proper
moment
has
come
they
all
rise
up
through
the
floor
and
enter
the
bodies
of
their
living
namesakes
offerings
of
food
drink
and
clothes
are
now
made
to
these
namesakes
who
eat
and
drink
and
wear
the
clothes
on
behalf
of
the
ghosts
finally
the
shades
refreshed
and
strengthened
by
the
banquet
are
sent
away
back
to
their
graves
thinly
clad
in
the
spiritual
essence
of
the
clothes
while
the
gross
material
substance
of
the
garments
is
retained
by
their
namesakes
here
the
reincarnation
of
the
dead
in
the
living
is
not
permanent
but
merely
occasional
and
temporary
still
a
special
connexion
may
well
be
thought
to
subsist
at
all
times
between
the
deceased
and
the
living
person
who
bears
his
or
her
name
the
foregoing
facts
seem
to
render
it
probable
that
even
where
a
belief
in
the
reincarnation
of
ancestors
either
is
not
expressly
attested
or
has
long
ceased
to
form
part
of
the
popular
creed
many
of
the
solemnities
which
attend
the
naming
of
children
may
have
sprung
originally
from
the
widespread
notion
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
come
to
life
again
in
their
namesakes
in
some
cases
the
period
during
which
the
name
of
the
deceased
may
not
be
pronounced
seems
to
bear
a
close
relation
to
the
time
during
which
his
mortal
remains
may
be
supposed
still
to
hold
together
thus
of
some
indian
tribes
on
the
coast
of
america
it
is
said
that
they
may
not
speak
the
name
of
a
dead
person
until
the
bones
are
finally
disposed
among
the
narrinyeri
of
south
australia
the
name
might
not
be
uttered
until
the
corpse
had
decayed
in
the
encounter
bay
tribe
of
the
same
country
the
dead
body
is
dried
over
a
fire
packed
up
in
mats
and
carried
about
for
several
months
among
the
scenes
which
had
been
familiar
to
the
deceased
in
his
life
next
it
is
placed
on
a
platform
of
sticks
and
left
there
till
it
has
completely
decayed
whereupon
the
next
of
kin
takes
the
skull
and
uses
it
as
a
after
that
the
name
of
the
departed
may
be
uttered
without
offence
were
it
pronounced
sooner
his
kinsmen
would
be
deeply
offended
and
a
war
might
be
the
result
the
rule
that
the
name
of
the
dead
may
not
be
spoken
until
his
body
has
mouldered
away
seems
to
point
to
a
belief
that
the
spirit
continues
to
exist
only
so
long
as
the
body
does
so
and
that
when
the
material
frame
is
dissolved
the
spiritual
part
of
the
man
perishes
with
it
or
goes
away
or
at
least
becomes
so
feeble
and
incapable
of
mischief
that
his
name
may
be
bandied
about
with
impunity
this
view
is
to
some
extent
confirmed
by
the
practice
of
the
arunta
tribe
in
central
australia
we
have
seen
that
among
them
no
one
may
mention
the
name
of
the
deceased
during
the
period
of
mourning
for
fear
of
disturbing
and
annoying
the
ghost
who
is
believed
to
be
walking
about
at
large
some
of
the
relations
of
the
dead
man
it
is
true
such
as
his
parents
elder
brothers
and
sisters
paternal
aunts
and
all
his
whether
actual
or
possible
are
debarred
all
their
lives
from
taking
his
name
into
their
lips
but
other
people
including
his
wife
children
grandchildren
grandparents
younger
brothers
and
sisters
and
are
free
to
name
him
so
soon
as
he
has
ceased
to
walk
the
earth
and
hence
to
be
dangerous
some
twelve
or
eighteen
months
after
his
death
the
people
seem
to
think
that
the
dead
man
has
enjoyed
his
liberty
long
enough
and
that
it
is
time
to
confine
his
restless
spirit
within
narrower
bounds
accordingly
a
grand
battue
or
brings
the
days
of
mourning
to
an
end
the
favourite
haunt
of
the
deceased
is
believed
to
be
the
burnt
and
deserted
camp
where
he
died
here
therefore
on
a
certain
day
a
band
of
men
and
women
the
men
armed
with
shields
and
assemble
and
begin
dancing
round
the
charred
and
blackened
remains
of
the
camp
shouting
and
beating
the
air
with
their
weapons
and
hands
in
order
to
drive
away
the
lingering
spirit
from
the
spot
he
loves
too
well
when
the
dancing
is
over
the
whole
party
proceed
to
the
grave
at
a
run
chasing
the
ghost
before
them
it
is
in
vain
that
the
unhappy
ghost
makes
a
last
bid
for
freedom
and
breaking
away
from
the
beaters
doubles
back
towards
the
camp
the
leader
of
the
party
is
prepared
for
this
manœuvre
and
by
making
a
long
circuit
adroitly
cuts
off
the
retreat
of
the
fugitive
finally
having
run
him
to
earth
they
trample
him
down
into
the
grave
dancing
and
stamping
on
the
soil
while
with
downward
thrusts
through
the
air
they
beat
and
force
him
under
ground
there
lying
in
his
narrow
house
flattened
and
prostrate
under
a
load
of
earth
the
poor
ghost
sees
his
widow
wearing
the
gay
feathers
of
the
parrot
in
her
hair
and
he
knows
that
the
time
of
her
mourning
for
him
is
over
the
loud
shouts
of
the
men
and
women
shew
him
that
they
are
not
to
be
frightened
and
bullied
by
him
any
more
and
that
he
had
better
lie
quiet
but
he
may
still
watch
over
his
friends
and
guard
them
from
harm
and
visit
them
in
dreams
names
of
kings
and
other
sacred
persons
tabooed
when
we
see
that
in
primitive
society
the
names
of
mere
commoners
whether
alive
or
dead
are
matters
of
such
anxious
care
we
need
not
be
surprised
that
great
precautions
should
be
taken
to
guard
from
harm
the
names
of
sacred
kings
and
priests
thus
the
name
of
the
king
of
dahomey
is
always
kept
secret
lest
the
knowledge
of
it
should
enable
some
person
to
do
him
a
mischief
the
appellations
by
which
the
different
kings
of
dahomey
have
been
known
to
europeans
are
not
their
true
names
but
mere
titles
or
what
the
natives
call
strong
names
as
a
rule
these
strong
names
are
the
first
words
of
sentences
descriptive
of
certain
qualities
thus
agaja
the
name
by
which
the
fourth
king
of
the
dynasty
was
known
was
part
of
a
sentence
meaning
a
spreading
tree
must
be
lopped
before
it
can
be
cast
into
the
fire
and
tegbwesun
the
name
of
the
fifth
king
formed
the
first
word
of
a
sentence
which
signified
no
one
can
take
the
cloth
off
the
neck
of
a
wild
the
natives
seem
to
think
that
no
harm
comes
of
such
titles
being
known
since
they
are
not
like
the
vitally
connected
with
their
owners
in
the
galla
kingdom
of
ghera
the
of
the
sovereign
may
not
be
pronounced
by
a
subject
under
pain
of
death
and
common
words
which
resemble
it
in
sound
are
changed
for
others
thus
when
a
queen
named
carre
reigned
over
the
kingdom
the
word
which
means
smoke
was
exchanged
for
further
ass
was
replaced
by
and
potato
was
dropped
and
substituted
for
it
among
the
bahima
of
central
africa
when
the
king
dies
his
name
is
abolished
from
the
language
and
if
his
name
was
that
of
an
animal
a
new
appellation
must
be
found
for
the
creature
at
once
for
example
the
king
is
often
called
a
lion
hence
at
the
death
of
a
king
named
lion
a
new
name
for
lions
in
general
has
to
be
coined
thus
in
the
language
of
the
bahima
the
word
for
lion
some
years
ago
was
but
when
a
prominent
chief
of
that
name
died
the
word
for
lion
was
changed
to
again
in
the
bahima
language
the
word
for
nine
used
to
be
a
word
which
occurs
with
the
same
meaning
but
dialectical
variations
in
the
languages
of
other
tribes
of
central
and
eastern
africa
but
when
a
chief
who
bore
the
name
mwenda
died
the
old
name
for
nine
had
to
be
changed
and
accordingly
the
word
has
been
substituted
for
it
in
siam
it
used
to
be
difficult
to
ascertain
the
king
s
real
name
since
it
was
carefully
kept
secret
from
fear
of
sorcery
any
one
who
mentioned
it
was
clapped
into
gaol
the
king
might
only
be
referred
to
under
certain
titles
such
as
the
august
the
perfect
the
supreme
the
great
emperor
descendant
of
the
angels
and
so
on
in
burma
it
was
accounted
an
impiety
of
the
deepest
dye
to
mention
the
name
of
the
reigning
sovereign
burmese
subjects
even
when
they
were
far
from
their
country
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
do
so
after
his
accession
to
the
throne
the
king
was
known
by
his
royal
titles
only
the
proper
name
of
the
emperor
of
china
may
neither
be
pronounced
nor
written
by
any
of
his
subjects
coreans
were
formerly
forbidden
under
severe
penalties
to
utter
the
king
s
name
which
indeed
was
seldom
known
when
a
prince
ascends
the
throne
of
cambodia
he
ceases
to
be
designated
by
his
real
name
and
if
that
name
happens
to
be
a
common
word
in
the
language
the
word
is
often
changed
thus
for
example
since
the
reign
of
king
ang
duong
the
word
which
meant
a
small
coin
has
been
replaced
by
in
the
island
of
sunda
it
is
taboo
to
utter
any
word
which
coincides
with
the
name
of
a
prince
or
chief
the
name
of
the
rajah
of
bolang
mongondo
a
district
in
the
west
of
celebes
is
never
mentioned
except
in
case
of
urgent
necessity
and
even
then
his
pardon
must
be
asked
repeatedly
before
the
liberty
is
taken
in
the
island
of
sumba
people
do
not
mention
the
real
name
of
a
prince
but
refer
to
him
by
the
name
of
the
first
slave
whom
in
his
youth
he
became
master
of
this
slave
is
regarded
by
the
chief
as
his
second
self
and
he
enjoys
practical
impunity
for
any
misdeeds
he
may
commit
among
the
zulus
no
man
will
mention
the
name
of
the
chief
of
his
tribe
or
the
names
of
the
progenitors
of
the
chief
so
far
as
he
can
remember
them
nor
will
he
utter
common
words
which
coincide
with
or
merely
resemble
in
sound
tabooed
names
as
for
instance
the
zungu
tribe
say
for
water
and
for
grass
and
for
assegai
and
for
path
because
their
present
chief
is
inhlela
his
father
was
manzini
his
grandfather
imkondo
and
one
before
him
in
the
tribe
of
the
dwandwes
there
was
a
chief
called
langa
which
means
the
sun
hence
the
name
of
the
sun
was
changed
from
to
and
so
remains
to
this
day
though
langa
died
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
once
more
in
the
xnumayo
tribe
the
word
meaning
to
herd
cattle
was
changed
from
or
to
because
was
the
name
of
the
chief
besides
these
taboos
which
were
observed
by
each
tribe
separately
all
the
zulu
tribes
united
in
tabooing
the
name
of
the
king
who
reigned
over
the
whole
nation
hence
for
example
when
panda
was
king
of
zululand
the
word
for
a
root
of
a
tree
which
is
was
changed
to
again
the
word
for
lies
or
slander
was
altered
from
to
because
contains
a
syllable
of
the
name
of
the
famous
king
cetchwayo
these
substitutions
are
not
however
carried
so
far
by
the
men
as
by
the
women
who
omit
every
sound
even
remotely
resembling
one
that
occurs
in
a
tabooed
name
at
the
king
s
kraal
indeed
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
understand
the
speech
of
the
royal
wives
as
they
treat
in
this
fashion
the
names
not
only
of
the
king
and
his
forefathers
but
even
of
his
and
their
brothers
back
for
generations
when
to
these
tribal
and
national
taboos
we
add
those
family
taboos
on
the
names
of
connexions
by
marriage
which
have
been
already
described
we
can
easily
understand
how
it
comes
about
that
in
zululand
every
tribe
has
words
peculiar
to
itself
and
that
the
women
have
a
considerable
vocabulary
of
their
own
members
too
of
one
family
may
be
debarred
from
using
words
employed
by
those
of
another
the
women
of
one
kraal
for
instance
may
call
a
hyaena
by
its
ordinary
name
those
of
the
next
may
use
the
common
substitute
while
in
a
third
the
substitute
may
also
be
unlawful
and
another
term
may
have
to
be
invented
to
supply
its
place
hence
the
zulu
language
at
the
present
day
almost
presents
the
appearance
of
being
a
double
one
indeed
for
multitudes
of
things
it
possesses
three
or
four
synonyms
which
through
the
blending
of
tribes
are
known
all
over
zululand
in
madagascar
a
similar
custom
everywhere
prevails
and
has
resulted
as
among
the
zulus
in
producing
certain
dialectic
differences
in
the
speech
of
the
various
tribes
there
are
no
family
names
in
madagascar
and
almost
every
personal
name
is
drawn
from
the
language
of
daily
life
and
signifies
some
common
object
or
action
or
quality
such
as
a
bird
a
beast
a
tree
a
plant
a
colour
and
so
on
now
whenever
one
of
these
common
words
forms
the
name
or
part
of
the
name
of
the
chief
of
the
tribe
it
becomes
sacred
and
may
no
longer
be
used
in
its
ordinary
signification
as
the
name
of
a
tree
an
insect
or
what
not
hence
a
new
name
for
the
object
must
be
invented
to
replace
the
one
which
has
been
discarded
often
the
new
name
consists
of
a
descriptive
epithet
or
a
periphrasis
thus
when
the
princess
rabodo
became
queen
in
she
took
the
name
of
rasoherina
now
was
the
word
for
the
silkworm
moth
but
having
been
assumed
as
the
name
of
the
sovereign
it
could
no
longer
be
applied
to
the
insect
which
ever
since
has
been
called
offspring
of
so
again
if
a
chief
had
or
took
the
name
of
an
animal
say
of
the
dog
and
was
known
as
ramboa
the
animal
would
henceforth
be
called
by
another
name
probably
a
descriptive
one
such
as
the
barker
or
the
driver
away
etc
in
the
western
part
of
imerina
there
was
a
chief
called
but
was
one
of
the
names
of
the
crocodile
so
the
chiefs
subjects
might
not
call
the
reptile
by
that
name
and
were
always
scrupulous
to
use
another
it
is
easy
to
conceive
what
confusion
and
uncertainty
may
thus
be
introduced
into
a
language
when
it
is
spoken
by
many
little
local
tribes
each
ruled
by
a
petty
chief
with
his
own
sacred
name
yet
there
are
tribes
and
people
who
submit
to
this
tyranny
of
words
as
their
fathers
did
before
them
from
time
immemorial
the
inconvenient
results
of
the
custom
are
especially
marked
on
the
western
coast
of
the
island
where
on
account
of
the
large
number
of
independent
chieftains
the
names
of
things
places
and
rivers
have
suffered
so
many
changes
that
confusion
often
arises
for
when
once
common
words
have
been
banned
by
the
chiefs
the
natives
will
not
acknowledge
to
have
ever
known
them
in
their
old
sense
but
it
is
not
merely
the
names
of
living
kings
and
chiefs
which
are
tabooed
in
madagascar
the
names
of
dead
sovereigns
are
equally
under
a
ban
at
least
in
some
parts
of
the
island
thus
among
the
sakalavas
when
a
king
has
died
the
nobles
and
people
meet
in
council
round
the
dead
body
and
solemnly
choose
a
new
name
by
which
the
deceased
monarch
shall
be
henceforth
known
the
new
name
always
begins
with
lord
and
ends
with
thousand
to
signify
that
the
late
king
ruled
over
a
numerous
nation
the
body
of
the
name
is
composed
of
an
epithet
or
phrase
descriptive
of
the
deceased
or
of
his
reign
after
the
new
name
has
been
adopted
the
old
name
by
which
the
king
was
known
during
his
life
becomes
sacred
and
may
not
be
pronounced
under
pain
of
death
further
words
in
the
common
language
which
bear
any
resemblance
to
the
forbidden
name
also
become
sacred
and
have
to
be
replaced
by
others
for
example
after
the
death
of
king
makka
the
word
which
meant
a
canoe
was
abandoned
and
the
word
substituted
for
it
when
taoussi
died
the
word
signifying
beautiful
was
replaced
by
for
similar
reasons
the
word
old
was
changed
for
which
properly
means
ripe
the
word
castrated
was
dropped
and
cut
adopted
in
its
place
and
the
word
for
island
was
changed
into
which
signifies
strictly
a
place
where
there
is
again
when
a
sakalava
king
named
marentoetsa
died
two
words
fell
into
disuse
namely
the
word
or
meaning
true
and
the
word
meaning
persons
who
uttered
these
forbidden
words
were
looked
on
not
only
as
grossly
rude
but
even
as
felons
they
had
committed
a
capital
crime
however
these
changes
of
vocabulary
are
confined
to
the
district
over
which
the
deceased
king
reigned
in
the
neighbouring
districts
the
old
words
continue
to
be
employed
in
the
old
sense
again
among
the
bara
another
tribe
of
madagascar
the
memory
of
their
deceased
kings
is
held
in
the
very
highest
respect
the
name
of
such
kings
is
considered
sacred
indeed
for
utterance
and
no
one
is
allowed
to
pronounce
it
to
such
a
length
is
this
absurdity
carried
that
the
name
of
any
person
or
thing
whatsoever
if
it
bear
a
resemblance
to
the
name
of
the
deceased
king
is
no
longer
used
but
some
other
designation
is
given
for
instance
there
was
a
king
named
andriamasoandro
after
his
decease
the
word
was
no
longer
employed
as
the
name
of
the
sun
but
was
substituted
for
an
eminent
authority
on
madagascar
has
observed
a
curious
fact
which
has
had
a
very
marked
influence
on
the
malagasy
language
is
the
custom
of
no
longer
pronouncing
the
name
of
a
dead
person
nor
even
the
words
which
resemble
it
in
their
conclusions
the
name
is
replaced
by
another
king
ramitra
since
his
decease
has
been
called
mahatenatenarivou
the
prince
who
has
conquered
a
thousand
foes
and
a
malagasy
who
should
utter
his
old
name
would
be
regarded
as
the
murderer
of
the
prince
and
would
therefore
be
liable
to
the
confiscation
of
his
property
or
even
to
the
penalty
of
death
it
is
easy
accordingly
to
understand
how
the
malagasy
language
one
in
its
origin
has
been
corrupted
and
how
it
comes
about
that
at
the
present
day
there
are
discrepancies
between
the
various
dialects
in
menabe
since
the
death
of
king
vinany
the
word
meaning
a
pot
has
been
replaced
by
cooking
vessel
whereas
the
old
word
continues
in
use
in
the
rest
of
madagascar
these
changes
it
is
true
hardly
take
place
except
for
kings
and
great
the
sanctity
attributed
to
the
persons
of
chiefs
in
polynesia
naturally
extended
also
to
their
names
which
on
the
primitive
view
are
hardly
separable
from
the
personality
of
their
owners
hence
in
polynesia
we
find
the
same
systematic
prohibition
to
utter
the
names
of
chiefs
or
of
common
words
resembling
them
which
we
have
already
met
with
in
zululand
and
madagascar
thus
in
new
zealand
the
name
of
a
chief
is
held
so
sacred
that
when
it
happens
to
be
a
common
word
it
may
not
be
used
in
the
language
and
another
has
to
be
found
to
replace
it
for
example
a
chief
to
the
southward
of
east
cape
bore
the
name
of
maripi
which
signified
a
knife
hence
a
new
word
for
knife
was
introduced
and
the
old
one
became
obsolete
elsewhere
the
word
for
water
had
to
be
changed
because
it
chanced
to
be
the
name
of
the
chief
and
would
have
been
desecrated
by
being
applied
to
the
vulgar
fluid
as
well
as
to
his
sacred
person
this
taboo
naturally
produced
a
plentiful
crop
of
synonyms
in
the
maori
language
and
travellers
newly
arrived
in
the
country
were
sometimes
puzzled
at
finding
the
same
things
called
by
quite
different
names
in
neighbouring
tribes
when
a
king
comes
to
the
throne
in
tahiti
any
words
in
the
language
that
resemble
his
name
in
sound
must
be
changed
for
others
in
former
times
if
any
man
were
so
rash
as
to
disregard
this
custom
and
to
use
the
forbidden
words
not
only
he
but
all
his
relations
were
immediately
put
to
death
on
the
accession
of
king
otoo
which
happened
before
vancouver
s
visit
to
tahiti
the
proper
names
of
all
the
chiefs
were
changed
as
well
as
forty
or
fifty
of
the
commonest
words
in
the
language
and
every
native
was
obliged
to
adopt
the
new
terms
for
any
neglect
to
do
so
was
punished
with
the
greatest
severity
when
a
certain
king
named
tu
came
to
the
throne
of
tahiti
the
word
which
means
to
stand
was
changed
to
a
star
became
to
strike
was
turned
into
and
so
on
sometimes
as
in
these
instances
the
new
names
were
formed
by
merely
changing
or
dropping
some
letter
or
letters
of
the
original
words
in
other
cases
the
substituted
terms
were
entirely
different
words
whether
chosen
for
their
similarity
of
meaning
though
not
of
sound
or
adopted
from
another
dialect
or
arbitrarily
invented
but
the
changes
thus
introduced
were
only
temporary
on
the
death
of
the
king
the
new
words
fell
into
disuse
and
the
original
ones
were
revived
similarly
in
samoa
when
the
name
of
a
sacred
chief
was
that
of
an
animal
or
bird
the
name
of
the
animal
or
bird
was
at
once
changed
for
another
and
the
old
one
might
never
again
be
uttered
in
that
chief
s
district
for
example
a
sacred
samoan
chief
was
named
pe
a
which
means
hence
in
his
district
a
was
no
longer
called
a
but
a
bird
of
heaven
in
ancient
greece
the
names
of
the
priests
and
other
high
officials
who
had
to
do
with
the
performances
of
the
eleusinian
mysteries
might
not
be
uttered
in
their
lifetime
to
pronounce
them
was
a
legal
offence
the
pedant
in
lucian
tells
how
he
fell
in
with
these
august
personages
hailing
along
to
the
police
court
a
ribald
fellow
who
had
dared
to
name
them
though
well
he
knew
that
ever
since
their
consecration
it
was
unlawful
to
do
so
because
they
had
become
anonymous
having
lost
their
old
names
and
acquired
new
and
sacred
titles
from
two
inscriptions
found
at
eleusis
it
appears
that
the
names
of
the
priests
were
committed
to
the
depths
of
the
sea
probably
they
were
engraved
on
tablets
of
bronze
or
lead
which
were
then
thrown
into
deep
water
in
the
gulf
of
salamis
the
intention
doubtless
was
to
keep
the
names
a
profound
secret
and
how
could
that
be
done
more
surely
than
by
sinking
them
in
the
sea
what
human
vision
could
spy
them
glimmering
far
down
in
the
dim
depths
of
the
green
water
a
clearer
illustration
of
the
confusion
between
the
incorporeal
and
the
corporeal
between
the
name
and
its
material
embodiment
could
hardly
be
found
than
in
this
practice
of
civilised
greece
in
togo
a
district
of
west
africa
a
secret
religious
society
flourishes
under
the
name
of
the
yewe
order
both
men
and
women
are
admitted
to
it
the
teaching
and
practice
of
the
order
are
lewd
and
licentious
murderers
and
debtors
join
it
for
the
sake
of
escaping
from
justice
for
the
members
are
not
amenable
to
the
laws
on
being
initiated
every
one
receives
a
new
name
and
thenceforth
his
or
her
old
name
may
never
be
mentioned
by
anybody
under
penalty
of
a
heavy
fine
should
the
old
name
be
uttered
in
a
quarrel
by
an
uninitiated
person
the
aggrieved
party
who
seems
to
be
oftener
a
woman
than
a
man
pretends
to
fall
into
a
frenzy
and
in
this
state
rushes
into
the
house
of
the
offender
smashes
his
pots
destroys
the
grass
roof
and
tears
down
the
fence
then
she
runs
away
into
the
forest
where
the
simple
people
believe
that
she
is
changed
into
a
leopard
in
truth
she
slinks
by
night
into
the
conventual
buildings
of
the
order
and
is
there
secretly
kept
in
comfort
till
the
business
is
settled
at
last
she
is
publicly
brought
back
by
the
society
with
great
pomp
her
body
smeared
with
red
earth
and
adorned
with
an
artificial
tail
in
order
to
make
the
ignorant
think
that
she
has
really
been
turned
into
a
leopard
when
the
name
is
held
to
be
a
vital
part
of
the
person
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
the
mightier
the
person
the
more
potent
must
be
his
name
hence
the
names
of
supernatural
beings
such
as
gods
and
spirits
are
commonly
believed
to
be
endowed
with
marvellous
virtues
and
the
mere
utterance
of
them
may
work
wonders
and
disturb
the
course
of
nature
the
warramunga
of
central
australia
believe
in
a
formidable
but
mythical
snake
called
the
wollunqua
which
lives
in
a
pool
when
they
speak
of
it
amongst
themselves
they
designate
it
by
another
name
because
they
say
that
were
they
to
call
the
snake
too
often
by
its
real
name
they
would
lose
control
over
the
creature
and
it
would
come
out
of
the
water
and
eat
them
all
up
for
this
reason
too
the
sacred
books
of
the
mongols
which
narrate
the
miraculous
deeds
of
the
divinities
are
allowed
to
be
read
only
in
spring
or
summer
because
at
other
seasons
the
reading
of
them
would
bring
on
tempests
or
snow
when
campbell
was
travelling
with
some
bechuanas
he
asked
them
one
morning
after
breakfast
to
tell
him
some
of
their
stories
but
they
informed
him
that
were
they
to
do
so
before
sunset
the
clouds
would
fall
from
the
heavens
upon
their
heads
the
sulka
of
new
britain
believe
in
a
certain
hostile
spirit
named
kot
to
whose
wrath
they
attribute
earthquakes
thunder
and
lightning
among
the
things
which
provoke
his
vengeance
is
the
telling
of
tales
and
legends
by
day
stories
should
be
told
only
at
evening
or
night
most
of
the
rites
of
the
navajo
indians
may
be
celebrated
only
in
winter
when
the
thunder
is
silent
and
the
rattlesnakes
are
hibernating
were
they
to
tell
of
their
chief
gods
or
narrate
the
myths
of
the
days
of
old
at
any
other
time
the
indians
believe
that
they
would
soon
be
killed
by
lightning
or
when
washington
matthews
was
in
new
mexico
he
often
employed
as
his
guide
and
informant
a
member
of
the
tribe
who
had
lived
with
americans
and
mexicans
and
seemed
to
be
free
from
the
superstitions
of
his
fellows
on
one
occasion
says
matthews
during
the
month
of
august
in
the
height
of
the
rainy
season
i
had
him
in
my
study
conversing
with
him
in
an
unguarded
moment
on
his
part
i
led
him
into
a
discussion
about
the
gods
of
his
people
and
neither
of
us
had
noticed
a
heavy
storm
coming
over
the
crest
of
the
zuñi
mountains
close
by
we
were
just
talking
of
estsanatlehi
the
goddess
of
the
west
when
the
house
was
shaken
by
a
terrific
peal
of
thunder
he
rose
at
once
pale
and
evidently
agitated
and
whispering
hoarsely
wait
till
christmas
they
are
angry
he
hurried
away
i
have
seen
many
such
evidences
of
the
deep
influence
of
this
superstition
on
among
the
iroquois
the
rehearsal
of
tales
of
wonder
formed
the
chief
entertainment
at
the
fireside
in
winter
but
all
the
summer
long
from
the
time
when
the
trees
began
to
bud
in
spring
till
the
red
leaves
of
autumn
began
to
fall
these
marvellous
stories
were
hushed
and
historical
traditions
took
their
place
other
indian
tribes
also
will
only
tell
their
mythic
tales
in
winter
when
the
snow
lies
like
a
pall
on
the
ground
and
lakes
and
rivers
are
covered
with
sheets
of
ice
for
then
the
spirits
underground
can
not
hear
the
stories
in
which
their
names
are
made
free
with
by
merry
groups
gathered
round
the
fire
the
yabims
of
german
new
guinea
tell
their
magical
tales
especially
at
the
time
when
the
yams
have
been
gathered
and
are
stored
in
the
houses
such
tales
are
told
at
evening
by
the
light
of
the
fire
to
a
circle
of
eager
listeners
the
narrative
being
broken
from
time
to
time
with
a
song
in
which
the
hearers
join
the
telling
of
these
stories
is
believed
to
promote
the
growth
of
the
crops
hence
each
tale
ends
with
a
wish
that
there
may
be
many
yams
that
the
taro
may
be
big
the
thick
and
the
bananas
long
among
the
kwakiutl
indians
of
british
columbia
the
superstition
about
names
has
affected
in
a
very
curious
way
the
social
structure
of
the
tribe
the
nobles
have
two
different
sets
of
names
one
for
use
in
winter
and
the
other
in
summer
their
winter
names
are
those
which
were
given
them
at
initiation
by
their
guardian
spirits
and
as
these
spirits
appear
to
their
devotees
only
in
winter
the
names
which
they
bestowed
on
the
indians
may
not
be
pronounced
in
summer
conversely
the
summer
names
may
not
be
used
in
winter
the
change
from
summer
to
winter
names
takes
place
from
the
moment
when
the
spirits
are
supposed
to
be
present
and
it
involves
a
complete
transformation
of
the
social
system
for
whereas
during
summer
the
people
are
grouped
in
clans
in
winter
they
are
grouped
in
societies
each
society
consisting
of
all
persons
who
have
been
initiated
by
the
same
spirit
and
have
received
from
him
the
same
magical
powers
thus
among
these
indians
the
fundamental
constitution
of
society
changes
with
the
seasons
in
summer
it
is
organised
on
a
basis
of
kin
in
winter
on
a
basis
of
spiritual
affinity
for
one
half
the
year
it
is
civil
for
the
other
half
religious
names
of
gods
tabooed
primitive
man
creates
his
gods
in
his
own
image
xenophanes
remarked
long
ago
that
the
complexion
of
negro
gods
was
black
and
their
noses
flat
that
thracian
gods
were
ruddy
and
and
that
if
horses
oxen
and
lions
only
believed
in
gods
and
had
hands
wherewith
to
portray
them
they
would
doubtless
fashion
their
deities
in
the
form
of
horses
and
oxen
and
lions
hence
just
as
the
furtive
savage
conceals
his
real
name
because
he
fears
that
sorcerers
might
make
an
evil
use
of
it
so
he
fancies
that
his
gods
must
likewise
keep
their
true
names
secret
lest
other
gods
or
even
men
should
learn
the
mystic
sounds
and
thus
be
able
to
conjure
with
them
nowhere
was
this
crude
conception
of
the
secrecy
and
magical
virtue
of
the
divine
name
more
firmly
held
or
more
fully
developed
than
in
ancient
egypt
where
the
superstitions
of
a
dateless
past
were
embalmed
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
hardly
less
effectually
than
the
bodies
of
cats
and
crocodiles
and
the
rest
of
the
divine
menagerie
in
their
tombs
the
conception
is
well
illustrated
by
a
story
which
tells
how
the
subtle
isis
wormed
his
secret
name
from
ra
the
great
egyptian
god
of
the
sun
isis
so
runs
the
tale
was
a
woman
mighty
in
words
and
she
was
weary
of
the
world
of
men
and
yearned
after
the
world
of
the
gods
and
she
meditated
in
her
heart
saying
can
not
i
by
virtue
of
the
great
name
of
ra
make
myself
a
goddess
and
reign
like
him
in
heaven
and
earth
for
ra
had
many
names
but
the
great
name
which
gave
him
all
power
over
gods
and
men
was
known
to
none
but
himself
now
the
god
was
by
this
time
grown
old
he
slobbered
at
the
mouth
and
his
spittle
fell
upon
the
ground
so
isis
gathered
up
the
spittle
and
the
earth
with
it
and
kneaded
thereof
a
serpent
and
laid
it
in
the
path
where
the
great
god
passed
every
day
to
his
double
kingdom
after
his
heart
s
desire
and
when
he
came
forth
according
to
his
wont
attended
by
all
his
company
of
gods
the
sacred
serpent
stung
him
and
the
god
opened
his
mouth
and
cried
and
his
cry
went
up
to
heaven
and
the
company
of
gods
cried
what
aileth
thee
and
the
gods
shouted
lo
and
behold
but
he
could
not
answer
his
jaws
rattled
his
limbs
shook
the
poison
ran
through
his
flesh
as
the
nile
floweth
over
the
land
when
the
great
god
had
stilled
his
heart
he
cried
to
his
followers
come
to
me
o
my
children
offspring
of
my
body
i
am
a
prince
the
son
of
a
prince
the
divine
seed
of
a
god
my
father
devised
my
name
my
father
and
my
mother
gave
me
my
name
and
it
remained
hidden
in
my
body
since
my
birth
that
no
magician
might
have
magic
power
over
me
i
went
out
to
behold
that
which
i
have
made
i
walked
in
the
two
lands
which
i
have
created
and
lo
something
stung
me
what
it
was
i
know
not
was
it
fire
was
it
water
my
heart
is
on
fire
my
flesh
trembleth
all
my
limbs
do
quake
bring
me
the
children
of
the
gods
with
healing
words
and
understanding
lips
whose
power
reacheth
to
then
came
to
him
the
children
of
the
gods
and
they
were
very
sorrowful
and
isis
came
with
her
craft
whose
mouth
is
full
of
the
breath
of
life
whose
spells
chase
pain
away
whose
word
maketh
the
dead
to
live
she
said
what
is
it
divine
father
what
is
it
the
holy
god
opened
his
mouth
he
spake
and
said
i
went
upon
my
way
i
walked
after
my
heart
s
desire
in
the
two
regions
which
i
have
made
to
behold
that
which
i
have
created
and
lo
a
serpent
that
i
saw
not
stung
me
is
it
fire
is
it
water
i
am
colder
than
water
i
am
hotter
than
fire
all
my
limbs
sweat
i
tremble
mine
eye
is
not
steadfast
i
behold
not
the
sky
the
moisture
bedeweth
my
face
as
in
then
spake
isis
tell
me
thy
name
divine
father
for
the
man
shall
live
who
is
called
by
his
then
answered
ra
i
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
i
ordered
the
mountains
i
made
the
great
and
wide
sea
i
stretched
out
the
two
horizons
like
a
curtain
i
am
he
who
openeth
his
eyes
and
it
is
light
and
who
shutteth
them
and
it
is
dark
at
his
command
the
nile
riseth
but
the
gods
know
not
his
name
i
am
khepera
in
the
morning
i
am
ra
at
noon
i
am
tum
at
but
the
poison
was
not
taken
away
from
him
it
pierced
deeper
and
the
great
god
could
no
longer
walk
then
said
isis
to
him
that
was
not
thy
name
that
thou
spakest
unto
me
oh
tell
it
me
that
the
poison
may
depart
for
he
shall
live
whose
name
is
now
the
poison
burned
like
fire
it
was
hotter
than
the
flame
of
fire
the
god
said
i
consent
that
isis
shall
search
into
me
and
that
my
name
shall
pass
from
my
breast
into
then
the
god
hid
himself
from
the
gods
and
his
place
in
the
ship
of
eternity
was
empty
thus
was
the
name
of
the
great
god
taken
from
him
and
isis
the
witch
spake
flow
away
poison
depart
from
ra
it
is
i
even
i
who
overcome
the
poison
and
cast
it
to
the
earth
for
the
name
of
the
great
god
hath
been
taken
away
from
him
let
ra
live
and
let
the
poison
thus
spake
great
isis
the
queen
of
the
gods
she
who
knows
ra
and
his
true
name
thus
we
see
that
the
real
name
of
the
god
with
which
his
power
was
inextricably
bound
up
was
supposed
to
be
lodged
in
an
almost
physical
sense
somewhere
in
his
breast
from
which
it
could
be
extracted
by
a
sort
of
surgical
operation
and
transferred
with
all
its
supernatural
powers
to
the
breast
of
another
in
egypt
attempts
like
that
of
isis
to
appropriate
the
power
of
a
high
god
by
possessing
herself
of
his
name
were
not
mere
legends
told
of
the
mythical
beings
of
a
remote
past
every
egyptian
magician
aspired
to
wield
like
powers
by
similar
means
for
it
was
believed
that
he
who
possessed
the
true
name
possessed
the
very
being
of
god
or
man
and
could
force
even
a
deity
to
obey
him
as
a
slave
obeys
his
master
thus
the
art
of
the
magician
consisted
in
obtaining
from
the
gods
a
revelation
of
their
sacred
names
and
he
left
no
stone
unturned
to
accomplish
his
end
when
once
a
god
in
a
moment
of
weakness
or
forgetfulness
had
imparted
to
the
wizard
the
wondrous
lore
the
deity
had
no
choice
but
to
submit
humbly
to
the
man
or
pay
the
penalty
of
his
contumacy
in
one
papyrus
we
find
the
god
typhon
thus
adjured
i
invoke
thee
by
thy
true
names
in
virtue
of
which
thou
canst
not
refuse
to
hear
me
and
in
another
the
magician
threatens
osiris
that
if
the
god
does
not
do
his
bidding
he
will
name
him
aloud
in
the
port
of
busiris
so
in
the
lucan
the
thessalian
witch
whom
sextus
pompeius
consulted
before
the
battle
of
pharsalia
threatens
to
call
up
the
furies
by
their
real
names
if
they
will
not
do
her
bidding
in
modern
egypt
the
magician
still
works
his
old
enchantments
by
the
same
ancient
means
only
the
name
of
the
god
by
which
he
conjures
is
different
the
man
who
knows
the
most
great
name
of
god
can
we
are
told
by
the
mere
utterance
of
it
kill
the
living
raise
the
dead
transport
himself
instantly
wherever
he
pleases
and
perform
any
other
miracle
similarly
among
the
arabs
of
north
africa
at
the
present
day
the
power
of
the
name
is
such
that
when
one
knows
the
proper
names
the
jinn
can
scarcely
help
answering
the
call
and
obeying
they
are
the
servants
of
the
magical
names
in
this
case
the
incantation
has
a
constraining
quality
which
is
for
the
most
part
very
strongly
marked
when
ibn
el
hâdjdj
relates
how
the
jinn
yielded
up
their
secrets
to
him
he
says
i
once
met
the
seven
kings
of
the
jinn
in
a
cave
and
i
asked
them
to
teach
me
the
way
in
which
they
attack
men
and
women
causing
them
to
fall
sick
smiting
them
paralysing
them
and
the
like
they
all
answered
me
if
it
were
anybody
but
you
we
would
teach
that
to
nobody
but
you
have
discovered
the
bonds
the
spells
and
the
names
which
compel
us
were
it
not
for
the
names
by
which
you
have
constrained
us
we
would
not
have
answered
to
your
so
too
the
chinese
of
ancient
times
were
dominated
by
the
notion
that
beings
are
intimately
associated
with
their
names
so
that
a
man
s
knowledge
of
the
name
of
a
spectre
might
enable
him
to
exert
power
over
the
latter
and
to
bend
it
to
his
the
belief
in
the
magic
virtue
of
divine
names
was
shared
by
the
romans
when
they
sat
down
before
a
city
the
priests
addressed
the
guardian
deity
of
the
place
in
a
set
form
of
prayer
or
incantation
inviting
him
to
abandon
the
beleaguered
city
and
come
over
to
the
romans
who
would
treat
him
as
well
as
or
better
than
he
had
ever
been
treated
in
his
old
home
hence
the
name
of
the
guardian
deity
of
rome
was
kept
a
profound
secret
lest
the
enemies
of
the
republic
might
lure
him
away
even
as
the
romans
themselves
had
induced
many
gods
to
desert
like
rats
the
falling
fortunes
of
cities
that
had
sheltered
them
in
happier
days
nay
the
real
name
not
merely
of
its
guardian
deity
but
of
the
city
itself
was
wrapt
in
mystery
and
might
never
be
uttered
not
even
in
the
sacred
rites
a
certain
valerius
soranus
who
dared
to
divulge
the
priceless
secret
was
put
to
death
or
came
to
a
bad
end
in
like
manner
it
seems
the
ancient
assyrians
were
forbidden
to
mention
the
mystic
names
of
their
cities
and
down
to
modern
times
the
cheremiss
of
the
caucasus
keep
the
names
of
their
communal
villages
secret
from
motives
of
superstition
if
the
reader
has
had
the
patience
to
follow
this
long
and
perhaps
tedious
examination
of
the
superstitions
attaching
to
personal
names
he
will
probably
agree
that
the
mystery
in
which
the
names
of
royal
personages
are
so
often
shrouded
is
no
isolated
phenomenon
no
arbitrary
expression
of
courtly
servility
and
adulation
but
merely
the
particular
application
of
a
general
law
of
primitive
thought
which
includes
within
its
scope
common
folk
and
gods
as
well
as
kings
and
priests
common
words
tabooed
but
personal
names
are
not
the
only
words
which
superstitious
fears
have
banished
from
everyday
use
in
many
cases
similar
motives
forbid
certain
persons
at
certain
times
to
call
common
things
by
common
names
thus
obliging
them
either
to
refrain
from
mentioning
these
things
altogether
or
to
designate
them
by
special
terms
or
phrases
reserved
for
such
occasions
a
consideration
of
these
cases
follows
naturally
on
an
examination
of
the
taboos
imposed
upon
personal
names
for
personal
names
are
themselves
very
often
ordinary
terms
of
the
language
so
that
an
embargo
laid
on
them
necessarily
extends
to
many
expressions
current
in
the
commerce
of
daily
life
and
though
a
survey
of
some
of
the
interdicts
on
common
words
is
not
strictly
necessary
for
our
immediate
purpose
it
may
serve
usefully
to
complete
our
view
of
the
transforming
influence
which
superstition
has
exercised
on
language
i
shall
make
no
attempt
to
subject
the
examples
to
a
searching
analysis
or
a
rigid
classification
but
will
set
them
down
as
they
come
in
a
rough
geographical
order
and
since
my
native
land
furnishes
as
apt
instances
of
the
superstition
as
any
other
we
may
start
on
our
round
from
scotland
in
the
atlantic
ocean
about
six
leagues
to
the
west
of
gallon
head
in
the
lewis
lies
a
small
group
of
rocky
islets
known
as
the
flannan
islands
sheep
and
wild
fowl
are
now
their
only
inhabitants
but
remains
of
what
are
described
as
druidical
temples
and
the
title
of
the
sacred
isles
given
them
by
buchanan
suggest
that
in
days
gone
by
piety
or
superstition
may
have
found
a
safe
retreat
from
the
turmoil
of
the
world
in
these
remote
solitudes
where
the
dashing
of
the
waves
and
the
strident
scream
of
the
are
almost
the
only
sounds
that
break
the
silence
once
a
year
in
the
inhabitants
of
the
adjacent
lands
of
the
lewis
who
have
a
right
to
these
islands
cross
over
to
them
to
fleece
their
sheep
and
kill
the
wild
fowl
for
the
sake
both
of
their
flesh
and
their
feathers
they
regard
the
islands
as
invested
with
a
certain
sanctity
and
have
been
heard
to
say
that
none
ever
yet
landed
in
them
but
found
himself
more
disposed
to
devotion
there
than
anywhere
else
accordingly
the
fowlers
who
go
thither
are
bound
during
the
whole
of
the
time
that
they
ply
their
business
to
observe
very
punctiliously
certain
quaint
customs
the
transgression
of
which
would
be
sure
in
their
opinion
to
entail
some
serious
inconvenience
when
they
have
landed
and
fastened
their
boat
to
the
side
of
a
rock
they
clamber
up
into
the
island
by
a
wooden
ladder
and
no
sooner
are
they
got
to
the
top
than
they
all
uncover
their
heads
and
make
a
turn
round
about
thanking
god
for
their
safety
on
the
biggest
of
the
islands
are
the
ruins
of
a
chapel
dedicated
to
flannan
when
the
men
come
within
about
twenty
paces
of
the
altar
they
all
strip
themselves
of
their
upper
garments
at
once
and
betake
themselves
to
their
devotions
praying
thrice
before
they
begin
fowling
on
the
first
day
the
first
prayer
is
offered
as
they
advance
towards
the
chapel
on
their
knees
the
second
is
said
as
they
go
round
the
chapel
and
the
third
is
said
in
or
hard
by
the
ruins
they
also
pray
thrice
every
evening
and
account
it
unlawful
to
kill
a
fowl
after
evening
prayers
as
also
to
kill
a
fowl
at
any
time
with
a
stone
another
ancient
custom
forbids
the
crew
to
carry
home
in
the
boat
any
suet
of
the
sheep
they
slaughter
in
the
islands
however
many
they
may
kill
but
what
here
chiefly
concerns
us
is
that
so
long
as
they
stay
on
the
islands
they
are
strictly
forbidden
to
use
certain
common
words
and
are
obliged
to
substitute
others
for
them
thus
it
is
absolutely
unlawful
to
call
the
island
of
kilda
which
lies
thirty
leagues
to
the
southward
by
its
proper
gaelic
name
of
hirt
they
must
call
it
only
the
high
they
may
not
so
much
as
once
name
the
islands
in
which
they
are
fowling
by
the
ordinary
name
of
flannan
they
must
speak
only
of
the
there
are
several
other
things
that
must
not
be
called
by
their
common
names
which
in
the
language
of
the
natives
signifies
water
they
call
burn
a
rock
which
in
their
language
is
must
here
be
called
hard
shore
in
their
language
expressed
by
must
here
be
called
a
cave
sour
in
their
language
is
expressed
but
must
here
be
called
sharp
slippery
which
is
expressed
must
be
called
soft
and
several
other
things
to
this
when
highlanders
were
in
a
boat
at
sea
whether
sailing
or
fishing
they
were
forbidden
to
call
things
by
the
names
by
which
they
were
known
on
land
thus
the
should
not

this
practice
now
prevails
much
more
on
the
east
coast
than
on
the
west
where
it
may
be
said
to
be
generally
extinct
it
is
reported
to
be
carefully
observed
by
the
fishermen
about
the
cromarty
firth
among
the
words
tabooed
by
fishermen
in
the
north
of
scotland
when
they
are
at
sea
are

rabbit
rat
pig
and
porpoise
at
the
present
day
if
some
of
the
boats
that
come
to
the
at
wick
should
meet
a
from
reay
in
caithness
the
will
not
speak
to
nor
even
look
at
the
when
shetland
fishermen
are
at
sea
they
employ
a
nomenclature
peculiar
to
the
occasion
and
hardly
anything
may
be
mentioned
by
its
usual
name
the
substituted
terms
are
mostly
of
norwegian
origin
for
the
norway
men
were
reported
to
be
good
fishers
in
setting
their
lines
the
shetland
fishermen
are
bound
to
refer
to
certain
objects
only
by
some
special
words
or
phrases
thus
a
knife
is
then
called
a
or
a
church
becomes
or
a
minister
is
or
or
the
devil
is
auld
health
or
black
a
cat
is
or
on
the
coast
of
scotland
there
are
some
villages
of
which
the
inhabitants
never
pronounce
certain
words
and
family
names
when
they
are
at
sea
each
village
has
its
peculiar
aversion
to
one
or
more
of
these
words
among
which
are
minister
kirk
swine
salmon
trout
and
when
a
church
has
to
be
referred
to
as
often
happens
since
some
of
the
churches
serve
as
to
the
fishermen
at
sea
it
is
spoken
of
as
the
instead
of
the
a
minister
is
called
the
man
wi
the
black
it
is
particularly
unlucky
to
utter
the
word
sow
or
swine
or
pig
while
the
line
is
being
baited
if
any
one
is
foolish
enough
to
do
so
the
line
is
sure
to
be
lost
in
some
villages
on
the
coast
of
fife
a
fisherman
who
hears
the
word
spoken
will
cry
out
cold
in
the
village
of
buckie
there
are
some
family
names
especially
ross
and
in
a
less
degree
coull
which
no
fisherman
will
pronounce
if
one
of
these
names
be
mentioned
in
the
hearing
of
a
fisherman
he
spits
or
as
he
calls
it
any
one
who
bears
the
dreaded
name
is
called
a
and
is
referred
to
only
by
a
circumlocution
such
as
the
man
it
diz
so
in
so
or
the
laad
it
lives
at
such
and
such
a
during
the
men
who
are
unlucky
enough
to
inherit
the
tabooed
names
have
little
chance
of
being
hired
in
the
and
sometimes
if
they
have
been
hired
before
their
names
were
known
they
have
been
refused
their
wages
at
the
end
of
the
season
because
the
boat
in
which
they
sailed
had
not
been
successful
and
the
bad
luck
was
set
down
to
their
presence
in
it
although
in
scotland
superstitions
of
this
kind
appear
to
be
specially
incident
to
the
callings
of
fishermen
and
fowlers
other
occupations
are
not
exempt
from
them
thus
in
the
outer
hebrides
the
fire
of
a
kiln
is
not
called
fire
but
such
a
fire
it
is
said
is
a
dangerous
thing
and
ought
not
to
be
referred
to
except
by
a
euphemism
evil
be
to
him
who
called
it
fire
or
who
named
fire
in
the
kiln
it
was
considered
the
next
thing
to
setting
it
on
again
in
some
districts
of
scotland
a
brewer
would
have
resented
the
use
of
the
word
water
in
reference
to
the
work
in
which
he
was
engaged
water
be
your
part
of
it
was
the
common
retort
it
was
supposed
that
the
use
of
the
word
would
spoil
the
brewing
the
highlanders
say
that
when
you
meet
a
hobgoblin
and
the
fiend
asks
what
is
the
name
of
your
dirk
you
should
not
call
it
a
dirk
but
my
father
s
sister
m
or
my
grandmother
s
sister
mo
or
by
some
similar
title
if
you
do
not
observe
this
precaution
the
goblin
will
lay
such
an
enchantment
on
the
blade
that
you
will
be
unable
to
stab
him
with
it
the
dirk
will
merely
make
a
tinkling
noise
against
the
soft
impalpable
body
of
the
fiend
manx
fishermen
think
it
unlucky
to
mention
a
horse
or
a
mouse
on
board
a
the
fishermen
of
dieppe
on
board
their
boats
will
not
speak
of
several
things
for
instance
priests
and
cats
german
huntsmen
from
motives
of
superstition
call
everything
by
names
different
from
those
in
common
use
in
some
parts
of
bavaria
the
farmer
will
not
mention
a
fox
by
its
proper
name
lest
his
should
suffer
from
the
ravages
of
the
animal
so
instead
of
he
calls
the
beast
or
in
prussia
and
lithuania
they
say
that
in
the
month
of
december
you
should
not
call
a
wolf
a
wolf
but
the
vermin
otherwise
you
will
be
torn
in
pieces
by
the
werewolves
in
various
parts
of
germany
it
is
a
rule
that
certain
animals
may
not
be
mentioned
by
their
proper
names
in
the
mystic
season
between
christmas
and
twelfth
night
thus
in
thüringen
they
say
that
if
you
would
be
spared
by
the
wolves
you
must
not
mention
their
name
at
this
time
in
mecklenburg
people
think
that
were
they
to
name
a
wolf
on
one
of
these
days
the
animal
would
appear
a
shepherd
would
rather
mention
the
devil
than
the
wolf
at
this
season
and
we
read
of
a
farmer
who
had
a
bailiff
named
wolf
but
did
not
dare
to
call
the
man
by
his
name
between
christmas
and
twelfth
night
referring
to
him
instead
as
herr
undeert
monster
in
quatzow
a
village
of
mecklenburg
there
are
many
animals
whose
common
names
are
disused
at
this
season
and
replaced
by
others
thus
a
fox
is
called
and
a
mouse
any
person
who
disregards
the
custom
has
to
pay
a
fine
in
the
mark
of
brandenburg
they
say
that
between
christmas
and
twelfth
night
you
should
not
speak
of
mice
as
mice
but
as
otherwise
the
would
multiply
excessively
according
to
the
swedish
popular
belief
there
are
certain
animals
which
should
never
be
spoken
of
by
their
proper
names
but
must
always
be
signified
by
euphemisms
and
kind
allusions
to
their
character
thus
if
you
speak
slightingly
of
the
cat
or
beat
her
you
must
be
sure
not
to
mention
her
name
for
she
belongs
to
the
hellish
crew
and
is
a
friend
of
the
mountain
troll
whom
she
often
visits
great
caution
is
also
needed
in
talking
of
the
cuckoo
the
owl
and
the
magpie
for
they
are
birds
of
witchery
the
fox
must
be
called
or
he
that
goes
in
the
forest
and
rats
are
the
mice
the
small
grey
and
the
seal
brother
swedish
again
believe
that
if
the
wolf
and
the
bear
be
called
by
other
than
their
proper
and
legitimate
names
they
will
not
attack
the
herd
hence
they
give
these
brutes
names
which
they
fancy
will
not
hurt
their
feelings
the
number
of
endearing
appellations
lavished
by
them
on
the
wolf
is
legion
they
call
him
golden
tooth
the
silent
one
grey
legs
and
so
on
while
the
bear
is
referred
to
by
the
respectful
titles
of
the
old
man
grandfather
twelve
men
s
strength
golden
feet
and
more
of
the
same
sort
even
inanimate
things
are
not
always
to
be
called
by
their
usual
names
for
instance
fire
is
sometimes
to
be
called
heat
not
or
water
for
brewing
must
be
called
or
not
else
the
beer
would
not
turn
out
so
well
the
huzuls
of
the
carpathians
a
pastoral
people
who
dread
the
ravages
of
wild
beasts
on
their
flocks
and
herds
are
unwilling
to
mention
the
bear
by
his
proper
name
so
they
call
him
respectfully
the
little
uncle
or
the
big
in
like
manner
and
for
similar
reasons
they
name
the
wolf
the
little
one
and
the
serpent
the
long
they
may
not
say
that
wool
is
scalded
or
in
the
heat
of
summer
the
sheep
would
rub
themselves
till
their
sides
were
raw
so
they
merely
say
that
the
wool
is
warmed
the
lapps
fear
to
call
the
bear
by
his
true
name
lest
he
should
ravage
their
herds
so
they
speak
of
him
as
the
old
man
with
the
coat
of
skin
and
in
cooking
his
flesh
to
furnish
a
meal
they
may
not
refer
to
the
work
they
are
engaged
in
as
cooking
but
must
designate
it
by
a
special
term
the
finns
speak
of
the
bear
as
the
apple
of
the
wood
beautiful
the
pride
of
the
thicket
the
old
man
and
so
on
and
in
general
a
finnish
hunter
thinks
that
he
will
have
poor
sport
if
he
calls
animals
by
their
real
names
the
beasts
resent
it
the
fox
and
the
hare
are
only
spoken
of
as
game
and
the
lynx
is
termed
the
forest
cat
lest
it
should
devour
the
sheep
esthonian
peasants
are
very
loth
to
mention
wild
beasts
by
their
proper
names
for
they
believe
that
the
creatures
will
not
do
so
much
harm
if
only
they
are
called
by
other
names
than
their
own
hence
they
speak
of
the
bear
as
broad
foot
and
the
wolf
as
grey
the
natives
of
siberia
are
unwilling
to
call
a
bear
a
bear
they
speak
of
him
as
the
little
old
man
the
master
of
the
forest
the
sage
the
respected
some
who
are
more
familiar
style
him
my
the
kamtchatkans
reverence
the
whale
the
bear
and
the
wolf
from
fear
and
never
mention
their
names
when
they
meet
them
believing
that
they
understand
human
speech
further
they
think
that
mice
also
understand
the
kamtchatkan
language
so
in
autumn
when
they
rob
the
of
the
bulbs
which
these
little
creatures
have
laid
up
in
their
burrows
as
a
store
against
winter
they
call
everything
by
names
different
from
the
ordinary
ones
lest
the
mice
should
know
what
they
were
saying
moreover
they
leave
odds
and
ends
such
as
old
rags
broken
needles
and
so
forth
in
the
burrows
to
make
the
mice
think
that
the
transaction
has
been
not
a
robbery
but
a
fair
exchange
if
they
did
not
do
that
they
fancy
that
the
mice
would
go
and
drown
or
hang
themselves
out
of
pure
vexation
and
then
what
would
the
kamtchatkans
do
without
the
mice
to
gather
the
bulbs
for
them
they
also
speak
kindly
to
the
animals
and
beg
them
not
to
take
it
ill
explaining
that
what
they
do
is
done
out
of
pure
friendship
the
cherokee
indians
regard
the
rattlesnake
as
a
superior
being
and
take
great
pains
not
to
offend
him
they
never
say
that
a
man
has
been
bitten
by
a
snake
but
that
he
has
been
scratched
by
a
in
like
manner
when
an
eagle
has
been
shot
for
a
ceremonial
dance
it
is
announced
that
a
snowbird
has
been
the
purpose
is
to
deceive
the
spirits
of
rattlesnakes
or
eagles
which
might
be
listening
the
esquimaux
of
bering
strait
think
that
some
animals
can
hear
and
understand
what
is
said
of
them
at
a
distance
hence
when
a
hunter
is
going
out
to
kill
bears
he
will
speak
of
them
with
the
greatest
respect
and
give
out
that
he
is
going
to
hunt
some
other
beast
thus
the
bears
will
be
deceived
and
taken
unawares
among
the
esquimaux
of
baffin
land
women
in
mourning
may
not
mention
the
names
of
any
animals
among
the
thompson
indians
of
british
columbia
children
may
not
name
the
coyote
or
prairie
wolf
in
winter
lest
he
should
turn
on
his
back
and
so
bring
cold
weather
the
arabs
call
a
man
who
has
been
bitten
by
a
snake
the
sound
one
leprosy
or
the
scab
they
designate
the
blessed
disease
the
left
side
they
name
the
lucky
side
they
will
not
speak
of
a
lion
by
his
right
name
but
refer
to
him
as
for
example
the
in
africa
the
lion
is
alluded
to
with
the
same
ceremonious
respect
as
the
wolf
and
the
bear
in
northern
europe
and
asia
the
arabs
of
algeria
who
hunt
the
lion
speak
of
him
as
john
johnson
because
he
has
the
noblest
qualities
of
man
and
understands
all
languages
hence
too
the
first
huntsman
to
catch
sight
of
the
beast
points
at
him
with
his
finger
and
says
he
is
not
there
for
if
he
were
to
say
he
is
there
the
lion
would
eat
him
up
except
under
dire
necessity
the
waziguas
of
eastern
africa
never
mention
the
name
of
the
lion
from
fear
of
attracting
him
they
call
him
the
owner
of
the
land
or
the
great
the
negroes
of
angola
always
use
the
word
sir
in
speaking
of
the
same
noble
animal
because
they
think
that
he
is
fetish
and
would
not
fail
to
punish
them
for
disrespect
if
they
omitted
to
do
so
bushmen
and
bechuanas
both
deem
it
unlucky
to
speak
of
the
lion
by
his
proper
name
the
bechuanas
call
him
the
boy
with
the
during
an
epidemic
of
smallpox
in
mombasa
british
east
africa
it
was
noticed
that
the
people
were
unwilling
to
mention
the
native
name
of
the
disease
they
referred
to
it
either
as
grains
of
corn
or
simply
as
the
bad
so
the
chinese
of
amoy
are
averse
to
speak
of
fever
by
its
proper
name
they
prefer
to
call
it
beggar
s
disease
hoping
thereby
to
make
the
demons
of
fever
imagine
that
they
despise
it
and
that
therefore
it
would
be
useless
to
attack
them
some
of
the
natives
of
nigeria
dread
the
owl
as
a
bird
of
ill
omen
and
are
loth
to
mention
its
name
preferring
to
speak
of
it
by
means
of
a
circumlocution
such
as
the
bird
that
makes
one
the
herero
think
that
if
they
see
a
snake
and
call
it
by
its
name
the
reptile
will
sting
them
but
that
if
they
call
it
a
strap
it
will
lie
still
when
nandi
warriors
are
out
on
an
expedition
they
may
not
call
a
knife
a
knife
they
must
call
it
an
arrow
for
bleeding
cattle
and
none
of
the
party
may
utter
the
usual
word
employed
in
greeting
males
in
madagascar
there
seems
to
be
an
aversion
to
pronouncing
the
word
for
lightning
the
word
for
mud
is
sometimes
substituted
for
it
again
it
is
strictly
forbidden
to
mention
the
word
for
crocodile
near
some
rivers
of
madagascar
and
if
clothes
should
be
wetted
in
certain
other
rivers
of
the
island
you
may
not
say
that
they
are
wet
you
must
say
that
they
are
on
fire
or
that
they
are
drinking
water
a
certain
spirit
who
used
to
inhabit
a
lake
in
madagascar
entertained
a
rooted
aversion
to
salt
so
that
whenever
the
thing
was
carried
past
the
lake
in
which
he
resided
it
had
to
be
called
by
another
name
or
it
would
all
have
been
dissolved
and
lost
the
persons
whom
he
inspired
had
to
veil
their
references
to
the
obnoxious
article
under
the
disguise
of
sweet
in
a
west
african
story
we
read
of
a
man
who
was
told
that
he
would
die
if
ever
the
word
for
salt
was
pronounced
in
his
hearing
the
fatal
word
was
pronounced
and
die
he
did
sure
enough
but
he
soon
came
to
life
again
with
the
help
of
a
magical
wooden
pestle
of
which
he
was
the
lucky
possessor
in
india
the
animals
whose
names
are
most
commonly
tabooed
are
the
snake
and
the
tiger
but
the
same
tribute
of
respect
is
paid
to
other
beasts
also
sayids
and
mussulmans
of
high
rank
in
northern
india
say
that
you
should
never
call
a
snake
by
its
proper
name
but
always
describe
it
either
as
a
tiger
or
a
string
in
telingana
the
euphemistic
name
for
a
snake
which
should
always
be
employed
is
worm
or
insect
if
you
call
a

ignorant
bengalee
women
will
not
mention

might

to

they
call

the

when
they

they
say
the

they
say
that
if
a

bites

you
should
not
mention
its

but
merely
observe
a

natives
of
travancore
are
careful
not
to
speak
disrespectfully
of
serpents
a
cobra
is
called
the
good
lord
or
the
good
snake
while
the
malayalies
of
the
shervaray
hills
are
hunting
the
tiger
they
speak
of
the
beast
only
as
the
the
canarese
of
southern
india
call
the
tiger
either
the
dog
or
the
jackal
they
think
that
if
they
called
him
by
his
proper
name
he
would
be
sure
to
carry
off
one
of
them
the
jungle
people
of
northern
india
who
meet
the
tiger
in
his
native
haunts
will
not
pronounce
his
name
but
speak
of
him
as
the
jackal
or
the
beast
or
use
some
other
euphemistic
term
in
some
places
they
treat
the
wolf
and
the
bear
in
the
same
fashion
the
pankas
of
south
mirzapur
will
not
name
the
tiger
bear
camel
or
donkey
by
their
proper
names
the
camel
they
call
long
other
tribes
of
the
same
district
only
scruple
to
mention
certain
animals
in
the
morning
thus
the
kharwars
a
dravidian
tribe
will
not
name
a
pig
squirrel
hare
jackal
bear
monkey
or
donkey
in
the
morning
hours
if
they
have
to
allude
to
these
animals
at
that
time
they
call
them
by
special
names
for
instance
they
call
the
hare
the
one
or
he
that
hides
in
the
rocks
while
they
speak
of
the
bear
as
which
being
interpreted
means
he
with
the
liver
of
if
the
bhuiyars
are
absolutely
obliged
to
refer
to
a
monkey
or
a
bear
in
the
morning
they
speak
of
the
monkey
as
the
and
the
bear
as
the
eater
of
white
they
would
not
mention
a
crocodile
among
the
pataris
the
matutinal
title
of
the
bear
is
the
hairy
the
kols
a
dravidian
race
of
northern
india
will
not
speak
of
death
or
beasts
of
prey
by
their
proper
names
in
the
morning
their
name
for
the
tiger
at
that
time
of
day
is
he
with
the
claws
and
for
the
elephant
he
with
the
the
forests
of
the
sundarbans
the
district
at
the
mouth
of
the
ganges
are
full
of
tigers
and
the
annual
loss
of
life
among
the
woodcutters
is
heavy
here
accordingly
the
ferocious
animal
is
not
called
a
tiger
but
a
jackal
in
annam
the
fear
inspired
by
tigers
elephants
and
other
wild
animals
induces
the
people
to
address
these
creatures
with
the
greatest
respect
as
lord
or
grandfather
lest
the
beasts
should
take
umbrage
and
attack
them
the
tiger
reigns
supreme
in
the
forests
of
tonquin
and
and
the
peasants
honour
him
as
a
maleficent
deity
in
talking
of
him
they
always
call
him
which
means
monsieur
or
grandfather
they
are
convinced
that
if
they
dared
to
speak
of
him
disrespectfully
he
would
avenge
the
insult
in
siam
there
are
many
people
who
would
never
venture
to
utter
the
words
tiger
or
crocodile
in
a
spot
where
these
terrible
creatures
might
be
in
hiding
lest
the
sound
of
their
names
should
attract
the
attention
of
the
beasts
towards
the
speakers
when
the
malays
of
patani
bay
in
siam
are
in
the
jungle
and
think
there
is
a
tiger
near
they
will
either
speak
of
him
in
complimentary
terms
as
the
grandfather
of
the
woods
or
only
mention
him
in
a
whisper
in
laos
while
a
man
is
out
hunting
elephants
he
is
obliged
to
give
conventional
names
to
all
common
objects
which
creates
a
sort
of
special
language
for
so
when
the
chams
and
of
are
searching
for
the
precious
in
the
forest
they
must
employ
an
artificial
jargon
to
designate
most
objects
of
everyday
life
thus
for
example
fire
is
called
the
red
a
becomes
a
spider
and
so
on
some
of
the
terms
which
compose
the
jargon
are
borrowed
from
the
dialects
of
neighbouring
tribes
when
the
mentras
or
aborigines
of
malacca
are
searching
for
what
they
call
they
are
obliged
to
use
a
special
language
avoiding
the
words
in
ordinary
use
at
such
times
they
call
by
the
name
of
and
they
speak
of
a
snake
as
the
long
animal
and
of
the
elephant
as
the
great
they
have
also
to
observe
a
number
of
other
taboos
particularly
in
the
matter
of
diet
if
a
man
has
found
a
promising
tree
and
on
going
home
dreams
that
the
guardian
spirit
of
the
tree
demands
a
human
victim
as
the
price
of
his
property
the
dreamer
will
try
next
day
to
catch
somebody
asleep
and
to
smear
his
forehead
with
lime
this
is
a
sign
to
the
guardian
spirit
of
the
tree
who
accordingly
carries
away
the
soul
of
the
sleeper
to
the
land
of
the
dead
by
means
of
a
fever
or
other
ailment
whereas
the
original
dreamer
gets
a
good
supply
of
aloes
wood
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
parties
of
jakuns
and
binuas
go
out
to
seek
for
camphor
in
the
luxuriant
forests
of
their
native
country
which
is
the
narrow
southern
extremity
of
the
malay
peninsula
the
land
s
end
of
asia
they
are
absent
for
three
or
four
months
together
and
during
the
whole
of
this
time
the
use
of
the
ordinary
malay
language
is
forbidden
to
them
and
they
have
to
speak
a
special
language
called
by
them
the
camphor
language
or
indeed
not
only
have
the
searchers
to
employ
this
peculiar
language
but
even
the
men
and
women
who
stay
at
home
in
the
villages
are
obliged
to
speak
it
while
the
others
are
away
looking
for
the
camphor
they
believe
that
a
spirit
presides
over
the
camphor
trees
and
that
without
propitiating
him
they
could
not
obtain
the
precious
gum
the
shrill
cry
of
a
species
of
cicada
heard
at
night
is
supposed
to
be
the
voice
of
the
spirit
if
they
failed
to
employ
the
camphor
language
they
think
that
they
would
have
great
difficulty
in
finding
the
camphor
trees
and
that
even
when
they
did
find
them
the
camphor
would
not
yield
itself
up
to
the
collector
the
camphor
language
consists
in
great
part
of
words
which
are
either
malayan
or
of
malay
origin
but
it
also
contains
many
words
which
are
not
malayan
but
are
presumed
to
be
remains
of
the
original
jakun
dialects
now
almost
extinct
in
these
districts
the
words
derived
from
malayan
are
formed
in
many
cases
by
merely
substituting
a
descriptive
phrase
for
the
common
term
thus
instead
of
rice
they
say
grass
fruit
instead
of
gun
they
say
far
sounding
the
epithet
is
substituted
for
hog
hair
is
referred
to
as
leaves
and
so
on
so
when
the
battas
or
bataks
of
sumatra
have
gone
out
to
search
for
camphor
they
must
abandon
the
speech
of
daily
life
as
soon
as
they
reach
the
camphor
forest
for
example
if
they
wish
to
speak
of
the
forest
they
may
not
use
the
ordinary
word
for
it
but
must
call
it
when
they
have
fixed
on
a
spot
in
which
to
try
their
luck
they
set
up
a
booth
and
clear
a
space
in
front
of
it
to
serve
as
a
place
of
sacrifice
here
after
summoning
the
camphor
spirit
ni
by
playing
on
a
flute
they
offer
sacrifice
to
him
repeatedly
then
they
lie
down
to
dream
of
the
place
where
camphor
is
to
be
found
if
this
succeeds
the
leader
goes
and
chooses
the
tree
when
it
has
been
cut
down
to
the
accompaniment
of
certain
spells
or
incantations
one
of
the
men
runs
and
wraps
the
top
of
the
fallen
tree
in
a
garment
to
prevent
the
camphor
from
escaping
from
the
trunk
before
they
have
secured
it
then
the
tree
is
cleft
and
split
up
in
the
search
for
the
camphor
crystals
which
are
to
be
found
in
the
fibres
of
the
wood
similarly
when
the
kayans
of
borneo
are
searching
for
camphor
they
talk
a
language
invented
solely
for
their
use
at
this
time
the
camphor
itself
is
never
mentioned
by
its
proper
name
but
is
always
referred
to
as
the
thing
that
smells
and
all
the
tools
employed
in
collecting
the
drug
receive
fanciful
names
unless
they
conform
to
this
rule
they
suppose
that
the
camphor
crystals
which
are
found
only
in
the
crevices
of
the
wood
will
elude
them
the
malanau
tribes
of
borneo
observe
the
same
custom
very
strictly
believing
that
the
crystals
would
immediately
dissolve
if
they
spoke
anything
but
the
camphor
language
for
example
the
common
malanau
word
for
return
is
but
in
presence
of
a
camphor
tree
they
say
again
to
hide
is
in
the
malanau
language
but
when
they
are
looking
for
camphor
they
say
in
like
manner
all
common
names
for
implements
and
food
are
exchanged
for
others
in
some
tribes
the
may
never
mention
the
names
of
chiefs
and
influential
men
if
they
broke
this
rule
they
would
find
no
camphor
in
the
trees
in
the
western
states
of
the
malay
peninsula
the
chief
industry
is
and
odd
ideas
prevail
among
the
natives
as
to
the
nature
and
properties
of
the
ore
they
regard
it
as
alive
and
growing
sometimes
in
the
shape
of
a
buffalo
which
makes
its
way
from
place
to
place
underground
ore
of
inferior
quality
is
excused
on
the
score
of
its
tender
years
it
will
no
doubt
improve
as
it
grows
older
not
only
is
the
tin
believed
to
be
under
the
protection
and
command
of
certain
spirits
who
must
be
propitiated
but
it
is
even
supposed
to
have
its
own
special
likes
and
dislikes
for
certain
persons
and
things
hence
the
malays
deem
it
advisable
to
treat
tin
ore
with
respect
to
consult
its
convenience
nay
to
conduct
the
business
of
mining
in
such
a
way
that
the
ore
may
as
it
were
be
extracted
without
its
own
knowledge
when
such
are
their
ideas
about
the
mineral
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
miners
scruple
to
employ
certain
words
in
the
mines
and
replace
them
by
others
which
are
less
likely
to
give
offence
to
the
ore
or
its
guardian
spirits
thus
for
example
the
elephant
must
not
be
called
an
elephant
but
the
tall
one
who
turns
himself
about
and
in
like
manner
special
words
different
from
those
in
common
use
are
employed
by
the
miners
to
designate
the
cat
the
buffalo
the
snake
the
centipede
tin
sand
metallic
tin
and
lemons
lemons
are
particularly
distasteful
to
the
spirits

the
mines

the

everything
in

on

scale

far
at

can
make
it
so
the
very
nooses
destined

be
slipped
over

necks
or

of

dignified
by

again
the
on

their

in
scotland
are
reluctant
to
mention
the
names
of
birds
or
beasts
while
they
are
at
sea
all
animals
then
go
by
the
name
of
a
meaningless
word
which
is
believed
not
to
be
understood
by
the
creatures
to
whom
it
refers
particular
kinds
of
animals
are
distinguished
by
appropriate
epithets
the
pig
is
the
grunting
the
buffalo
is
the
that
says
the
snipe
is
the
that
cries
and
so
on
in
this
respect
the
fishermen
of
patani
bay
class
together
sea
spirits
buddhist
monks
beasts
and
reptiles
these
are
all
and
their
common
names
may
not
be
mentioned
at
sea
but
curiously
enough
they
lay
no
such
embargo
on
the
names
of
fish
and
birds
except
the
vulture
and
domestic
fowls
and
ducks
at
sea
the
vulture
is
named
bald
head
the
tiger
striped
the
snake
weaver
s
sword
the
horse
fast
and
a
species
of
monkey
long
the
human
foot
is
called
tortoise
and
a
buddhist
monk
yellow
on
account
of
the
colour
of
his
robe
these
malay
fishermen
are
at
least
as
unwilling
to
speak
of
a
buddhist
monk
at
sea
as
scotch
fishermen
are
to
mention
a
minister
in
similar
circumstances
if
one
of
them
mentions
a
monk
his
mates
will
fall
on
him
and
beat
him
whereas
for
other
slips
of
the
tongue
they
think
it
enough
to
throw
a
little
over
the
back
of
the
transgressor
and
to
say
may
the
be
dismissed
the
use
of
this
special
language
is
even
more
obligatory
by
night
than
by
day
on
shore
the
fishermen
make
very
merry
over
those
lubberly
landsmen
who
can
not
talk
correctly
at
sea
in
like
manner
achinese
fishermen
in
northern
sumatra
employ
a
special
vocabulary
when
they
are
at
sea
thus
they
may
not
call
a
mountain
a
mountain
or
billows
would
swamp
the
boat
they
refer
to
it
as
high
they
may
not
speak
of
an
elephant
by
its
proper
name
of
but
must
call
it
if
a
man
wishes
to
say
that
something
is
clear
he
must
not
use
the
ordinary
word
for
clear
because
it
bears
the
meaning
also
of
free
loose
and
the
utterance
of
such
a
word
might
enable
the
fish
to
get
free
from
the
net
and
escape
instead
of
he
must
therefore
employ
the
less
dangerous
synonym
in
like
manner
we
are
told
among
the
fishermen
of
the
north
coast
of
java
whole
lists
of
words
might
be
compiled
which
are
tabooed
at
sea
and
must
be
replaced
by
others
in
sumatra
the
spirits
of
the
gold
mines
are
treated
with
as
much
deference
as
the
spirits
of
the
in
the
malay
peninsula
tin
ivory
and
the
like
may
not
be
brought
by
the
miners
to
the
scene
of
their
operations
for
at
the
scent
of
such
things
the
spirits
of
the
mine
would
cause
the
gold
to
vanish
for
the
same
reason
it
is
forbidden
to
refer
to
certain
things
by
their
proper
names
and
in
speaking
of
them
the
miners
must
use
other
words
in
some
cases
for
example
in
removing
the
grains
of
the
gold
a
deep
silence
must
be
observed
no
commands
may
be
given
or
questions
asked
probably
because
the
removal
of
the
precious
metal
is
regarded
as
a
theft
which
the
spirits
would
punish
if
they
caught
the
thieves
in
the
act
certainly
the
dyaks
believe
that
gold
has
a
soul
which
seeks
to
avenge
itself
on
men
who
dig
the
precious
metal
but
the
angry
spirit
is
powerless
to
harm
miners
who
observe
certain
precautions
such
as
never
to
bathe
in
a
river
with
their
faces
turned
up
stream
never
to
sit
with
their
legs
dangling
and
never
to
tie
up
their
hair
again
a
sumatran
who
fancies
that
there
is
a
tiger

a
crocodile
in
his
neighbourhood
will
speak
of
the
animal
by
the
honourable
title
of
grandfather
for
the
purpose
of
propitiating
the
creature
in
the
forest
a

to
a
tiger
as
grandfather
to
whom
the
wood
belongs
he
with
the
striped
coat
or
the
roving
among
the
gayos
of
sumatra
it
is
forbidden
to
mention
the
name
of
in
the
house
of
a
man
who
is
suffering
from
the
disease
and
the
words
for
ugly
red
stinking
unlucky
and
so
forth
are
forbidden
under
the
same
circumstances
the
disease
is
referred
to
under
the
title
of
prince
of
the
averters
of
so
long
as
the
hunting
season
lasts
the
natives
of
nias
may
not
name
the
eye
the
hammer
stones
and
in
some
places
the
sun
by
their
true
names
no
smith
may
ply
his
trade
in
the
village
and
no
person
may
go
from
one
village
to
another
to
have
smith
s
work
done
for
him
all
this
with
the
exception
of
the
rule
about
not
naming
the
eye
and
the
sun
is
done
to
prevent
the
dogs
from
growing
stiff
and
so
losing
the
power
of
running
down
the
game
during
the
in
nias
the
reapers
seldom
speak
to
each
other
and
when
they
do
so
it
is
only
in
whispers
outside
the
field
they
must
speak
of
everything
by
names
different
from
those
in
common
use
which
gives
rise
to
a
special
dialect
or
jargon
known
as
field
it
has
been
observed
that
some
of
the
words
in
this
jargon
resemble
words
in
the
language
of
the
battas
of
sumatra
while
these
of
nias
are
at
work
they
may
not
address
each
other
by
their
names
they
must
use
only
such
general
terms
as
man
woman
girl
old
man
and
old
the
word
for
fire
may
not
pass
their
lips
instead
of
it
they
must
use
the
word
for
other
words
tabooed
to
them
during
the
harvest
are
the
words
for
smoke
and
if
a
reaper
wishes
to
ask
another
for
his
whetstone
to
sharpen
his
knife
he
must
speak
of
it
as
a
fowl
s
in
java
when
people
suspect
that
a
tiger
or
crocodile
is
near
they
avoid
the
use
of
the
proper
name
of
the
beast
and
refer
to
him
as
the
old
lord
or
similarly
men
who
are
watching
a
plantation
to
protect
it
from
wild
boars
speak
of
these
animals
as
handsome
men
when
after
harvest
the
unhusked
rice
is
to
be
brought
into
the
barn
the
barn
is
not
called
a
barn
but
the
dark
serious
epidemics
may
not
be
mentioned
by
their
true
names
thus
smallpox
is
called
the
pretty
girl
the
javanese
are
particularly
careful
to
eschew
certain
common
words
at
evening
or
night
thus
the
snake
is
then
called
a
the
venomous
centipede
is
referred
to
as
the
red
ant
oil
is
spoken
of
as
water
and
so
forth
and
when
leaves
and
herbs
are
being
gathered
for
use
in
medicine
they
are
regularly
designated
by
other
than
their
ordinary
names
the
alfoors
or
toradjas
of
poso
in
celebes
are
forbidden
by
custom
to
speak
the
ordinary
language
when
they
are
at
work
in
the
at
such
times
they
employ
a
secret
language
which
is
said
to
agree
with
the
ordinary
one
only
in
this
that
in
it
some
things
are
designated
by
words
usually
applied
in
a
different
sense
or
by
descriptive
phrases
or
circumlocutions
thus
instead
of
run
they
say
limp
instead
of
hand
they
say
that
with
which
one
reaches
instead
of
foot
they
say
that
with
which
one
limps
and
instead
of
ear
they
say
that
with
which
one
again
in
the
to
drink
becomes
to
thrust
forward
the
mouth
to
pass
by
is
expressed
by
to
nod
with
the
head
a
gun
is
a
and
wood
is
that
which
is
carried
on
the
the
writer
who
reports
the
custom
was
formerly
of
opinion
that
this
secret
language
was
designed
to
avoid
attracting
the
attention
of
evil
spirits
to
the
ripe
rice
but
further
enquiry
has
satisfied
him
that
the
real
reason
for
adopting
it
is
a
wish
not
to
frighten
the
soul
of
the
rice
by
revealing
to
it
the
alarming
truth
that
it
is
about
to
be
cut
carried
home
boiled
and
eaten
it
is
just
the
words
referring
to
these
actions
he
tells
us
which
are
especially
tabooed
and
replaced
by
others
beginning
with
a
rule
of
avoiding
a
certain
number
of
common
words
the
custom
has
grown
among
people
of
the
malay
stock
till
it
has
produced
a
complete
language
for
use
in
the
fields
in
minahassa
also
this
secret
consists
in
part
of
phrases
or
circumlocutions
of
which
many
are
said
to
be
very
poetical
but
it
is
not
only
on
the
harvest
field
that
the
toradja
resorts
to
the
use
of
a
secret
language
from
superstitious
motives
in
the
great
primaeval
forest
he
feels
ill
at
ease
for
well
he
knows
the
choleric
temper
of
the
spirits
who
inhabit
the
giant
trees
of
the
wood
and
that
were
he
to
excite
their
wrath
they
would
assuredly
pay
him
out
in
one
way
or
other
it
might
be
by
carrying
off
his
soul
and
so
making
him
ill
it
might
be
by
crushing
him
flat
under
a
falling
tree
these
touchy
beings
particularly
dislike
to
hear
certain
words
pronounced
and
accordingly
on
his
way
through
the
forest
the
toradja
takes
care
to
avoid
the
offensive
terms
and
to
substitute
others
for
them
thus
he
will
not
call
a
dog
a
dog
but
refers
to
it
as
the
hairy
one
a
buffalo
is
spoken
of
as
thick
hide
a
cooking
pot
becomes
that
which
is
set
down
the
hair
of
the
head
is
alluded
to
as
betel
goats
and
pigs
are
the
folk
under
the
house
a
horse
is
long
nose
and
deer
are
denizens
of
the
if
he
is
rash
or
careless
enough
to
utter
a
forbidden
word
in
the
forest
a
will
fetch
him
such
a
bang
on
the
head
that
the
blood
will
spout
from
his
nose
and
mouth
again
when
the
weather
is
fine
and
the
toradja
wishes
it
to
continue
so
he
is
careful
not
to
utter
the
word
rain
for
if
he
did
so
the
rain
would
fancy
he
was
called
for
and
would
obligingly
present
himself
indeed
in
the
district
of
pakambia
which
is
frequently
visited
by
heavy
storms
the
word
rain
may
not
be
mentioned
throughout
the
year
lest
it
should
provoke
a
tempest
the
unmentionable
thing
is
there
delicately
alluded
to
as
when
a
bugineese
or
macassar
man
is
at
sea
and
sailing
past
a
place
which
he
believes
to
be
haunted
by
evil
spirits
he
keeps
as
quiet
as
he
can
but
if
he
is
obliged
to
speak
he
designates
common
things
and
actions
such
as
water
wind
fire
cooking
eating
the
and
so
forth
by
peculiar
terms
which
are
neither
bugineese
nor
macassar
and
therefore
can
not
be
understood
by
the
evil
spirits
whose
knowledge
of
languages
is
limited
to
these
two
tongues
however
according
to
another
and
later
account
given
by
the
same
authority
it
appears
that
many
of
the
substituted
terms
are
merely
figurative
expressions
or
descriptive
phrases
borrowed
from
the
ordinary
language
thus
the
word
for
water
is
replaced
by
a
rare
word
meaning
rain
a
is
called
a
black
man
boiled
rice
is
one
who
is
eaten
a
fish
is
a
a
fowl
is
one
who
lives
in
a
poultry
hatch
and
an
ape
is
a
natives
of
the
island
of
saleyer
which
lies
off
the
south
coast
of
celebes
will
not
mention
the
name
of
their
island
when
they
are
making
a
certain
and
in
sailing
they
will
never
speak
of
a
fair
wind
by
its
proper
name
the
reason
in
both
cases
is
a
fear
of
disturbing
the
evil
spirits
when
natives
of
the
sapoodi
archipelago
to
the
of
java
are
at
sea
they
will
never
say
that
they
are
near
the
island
of
sapoodi
for
if
they
did
so
they
would
be
carried
away
from
it
by
a
head
wind
or
by
some
other
mishap
when
galelareese
sailors
are
crossing
over
to
a
land
that
is
some
way
off
say
one
or
two
days
sail
they
do
not
remark
on
any
vessels
that
may
heave
in
sight
or
any
birds
that
may
fly
past
for
they
believe
that
were
they
to
do
so
they
would
be
driven
out
of
their
course
and
not
reach
the
land
they
are
making
for
moreover
they
may
not
mention
their
own
ship
or
any
part
of
it
if
they
have
to
speak
of
the
bow
for
example
they
say
the
beak
of
the
bird
starboard
is
named
sword
and
larboard
the
inhabitants
of
ternate
and
of
the
sangi
islands
deem
it
very
dangerous
to
point
at
distant
objects
or
to
name
them
while
they
are
at
sea
once
while
sailing
with
a
crew
of
ternate
men
a
european
asked
one
of
them
the
name
of
certain
small
islands
which
they
had
passed
the
man
had
been
talkative
before
but
the
question
reduced
him
to
silence
sir
he
said
that
is
a
great
taboo
if
i
told
you
we
should
at
once
have
wind
and
tide
against
us
and
perhaps
suffer
a
great
calamity
as
soon
as
we
come
to
anchor
i
will
tell
you
the
name
of
the
the
sangi
islanders
have
besides
the
ordinary
language
an
ancient
one
which
is
only
partly
understood
by
some
of
the
people
this
old
language
is
often
used
by
them
at
sea
as
well
as
in
popular
songs
and
certain
heathen
rites
the
reason
for
resorting
to
it
on
shipboard
is
to
hinder
the
evil
spirits
from
overhearing
and
so
frustrating
the
plans
of
the
voyagers
the
nufoors
of
dutch
new
guinea
believe
that
if
they
were
to
mention
the
name
of
an
island
to
which
the
bow
of
their
vessel
was
pointing
they
would
be
met
by
storm
rain
or
mist
which
would
drive
them
from
their
course
in
some
parts
of
sunda
it
is
taboo
or
forbidden
to
call
a
goat
a
goat
it
must
be
called
a
deer
under
the
a
tiger
may
not
be
spoken
of
as
a
tiger
he
must
be
referred
to
as
the
supple
one
the
one
there
the
honourable
the
whiskered
one
and
so
on
neither
a
wild
boar
nor
a
mouse
may
be
mentioned
by
its
proper
name
a
boar
must
be
called
the
beautiful
one
masculine
and
the
mouse
the
beautiful
one
feminine
when
the
people
are
asked
what
would
be
the
consequence
of
breaking
a
taboo
they
generally
say
that
the
person
or
thing
would
suffer
for
it
either
by
meeting
with
a
mishap
or
by
falling
ill
but
some
say
they
do
not
so
much
fear
a
misfortune
as
experience
an
indefinite
feeling
half
fear
half
reverence
towards
an
institution
of
their
forefathers
others
can
assign
no
reason
for
observing
the
taboos
and
cut
enquiry
short
by
saying
that
it
is
so
because
it
is
when
the
kenyahs
of
borneo
are
about
to
poison
the
fish
of
a
section
of
the
river
with
the
root
they
always
speak
of
the
matter
as
little
as
possible
and
use
the
most
indirect
and
fanciful
modes
of
expression
thus
they
will
say
there
are
many
leaves
fallen
here
meaning
that
there
are
many
fish
in
the
river
and
they
will
not
breathe
the
name
of
the
root
if
they
must
refer
to
it
they
call
it
where
is
the
name
of
a
root
something
like
and
means
to
agree
upon
so
that
signifies
what
we
have
agreed
to
call
this
concealment
of
the
truth
deceives
all
the
bats
birds
and
insects
which
might
otherwise
overhear
the
talk
of
the
men
and
inform
the
fish
of
the
plot
against
them
these
kenyahs
also
fear
the
crocodile
and
do
not
like
to
mention
it
by
name
especially
if
one
be
in
sight
they
refer
to
the
beast
as
the
old
when
invades
a
village
of
the
sakarang
dyaks
in
borneo
the
people
desert
the
place
and
take
refuge
in
the
jungle
in
the
daytime
they
do
not
dare
to
stir
or
to
speak
above
a
whisper
lest
the
spirits
should
see
or
hear
them
they
do
not
call
the
by
its
proper
name
but
speak
of
it
as
jungle
leaves
or
fruit
or
the
chief
and
ask
the
sufferer
has
he
left
you
and
the
question
is
put
in
a
whisper
lest
the
spirit
should
hear
natives
of
the
philippines
were
formerly
prohibited
from
speaking
of
the
chase
in
the
house
of
a
fisherman
and
from
speaking
of
fishing
in
the
house
of
a
hunter
journeying
by
land
they
might
not
talk
of
marine
matters
and
sailing
on
the
sea
they
might
not
talk
of
terrestrial
matters
when
we
survey
the
instances
of
this
superstition
which
have
now
been
enumerated
we
can
hardly
fail
to
be
struck
by
the
number
of
cases
in
which
a
fear
of
spirits
or
of
other
beings
regarded
as
spiritual
and
intelligent
is
assigned
as
the
reason
for
abstaining
in
certain
circumstances
from
the
use
of
certain
words
the
speaker
imagines
himself
to
be
overheard
and
understood
by
spirits
or
animals
or
other
beings
whom
his
fancy
endows
with
human
intelligence
and
hence
he
avoids
certain
words
and
substitutes
others
in
their
stead
either
from
a
desire
to
soothe
and
propitiate
these
beings
by
speaking
well
of
them
or
from
a
dread
that
they
may
understand
his
speech
and
know
what
he
is
about
when
he
happens
to
be
engaged
in
that
which
if
they
knew
of
it
would
excite
their
anger
or
their
fear
hence
the
substituted
terms
fall
into
two
classes
according
as
they
are
complimentary
or
enigmatic
and
these
expressions
are
employed
according
to
circumstances
for
different
and
even
opposite
reasons
the
complimentary
because
they
will
be
understood
and
appreciated
and
the
enigmatic
because
they
will
not
we
can
now
see
why
persons
engaged
in
occupations
like
fishing
fowling
hunting
mining
reaping
and
sailing
the
sea
should
abstain
from
the
use
of
the
common
language
and
veil
their
meaning
in
strange
words
and
dark
phrases
for
they
have
this
in
common
that
all
of
them
are
encroaching
on
the
domain
of
the
elemental
beings
the
creatures
who
whether
visible
or
invisible
whether
clothed
in
fur
or
scales
or
feathers
whether
manifesting
themselves
in
tree
or
stone
or
running
stream
or
breaking
wave
or
hovering
unseen
in
the
air
may
be
thought
to
have
the
first
right
to
those
regions
of
earth
and
sea
and
sky
into
which
man
intrudes
only
to
plunder
and
destroy
thus
deeply
imbued
with
a
sense
of
the
life
and
intelligence
of
nature
man
at
a
certain
stage
of
his
intellectual
development
can
not
but
be
visited
with
fear
or
compunction
whether
he
is
killing
wild
fowl
among
the
stormy
hebrides
or
snaring
doves
in
the
sultry
thickets
of
the
malay
peninsula
whether
he
is
hunting
the
bear
in
lapland
snows
or
the
tiger
in
indian
jungles
or
hauling
in
the
dripping
net
laden
with
silvery
herring
on
the
coast
of
scotland
whether
he
is
searching
for
the
camphor
crystals
in
the
shade
of
the
tropical
forest
or
extracting
the
red
gold
from
the
darksome
mine
or
laying
low
with
a
sweep
of
his
sickle
the
yellow
ears
on
the
harvest
field
in
all
these
his
depredations
on
nature
man
s
first
endeavour
apparently
is
by
quietness
and
silence
to
escape
the
notice
of
the
beings
whom
he
dreads
but
if
that
can
not
be
he
puts
the
best
face
he
can
on
the
matter
by
dissembling
his
foul
designs
under
a
fair
exterior
by
flattering
the
creatures
whom
he
proposes
to
betray
and
by
so
guarding
his
lips
that
though
his
dark
ambiguous
words
are
understood
well
enough
by
his
fellows
they
are
wholly
unintelligible
to
his
victims
he
pretends
to
be
what
he
is
not
and
to
be
doing
something
quite
different
from
the
real
business
in
hand
he
is
not
for
example
a
fowler
catching
pigeons
in
the
forest
he
is

prince
or
king
solomon
himself
inviting
fair
princesses
into
his
palace
tower
or
ivory
hall
such
childish
pretences
suffice
to
cheat
the
guileless
creatures
whom
the
savage
intends
to
rob
or
kill
perhaps
they
even
impose
to
some
extent
upon
himself
for
we
can
hardly
dissever
them
wholly
from
those
forms
of
sympathetic
magic
in
which
primitive
man
seeks
to
effect
his
purpose
by
imitating
the
thing
he
desires
to
produce
or
even
by
assimilating
himself
to
it
it
is
hard
indeed
for
us
to
realise
the
mental
state
of
a
malay
wizard
masquerading
before
wild
pigeons
in
the
character
of
king
solomon
yet
perhaps
the
of
children
and
of
the
stage
where
we
see
the
players
daily
forgetting
their
real
selves
in
their
passionate
impersonation
of
the
shadowy
realm
of
fancy
may
afford
us
some
glimpse
into
the
workings
of
that
instinct
of
imitation
or
mimicry
which
is
deeply
implanted
in
the
constitution
of
the
human
mind
chapter

our
debt
to
the
savage
it
would
be
easy
to
extend
the
list
of
royal
and
priestly
taboos
but
the
instances
collected
in
the
preceding
pages
may
suffice
as
specimens
to
conclude
this
part
of
our
subject
it
only
remains
to
state
summarily
the
general
conclusions
to
which
our
enquiries
have
thus
far
conducted
us
we
have
seen
that
in
savage
or
barbarous
society
there
are
often
found
men
to
whom
the
superstition
of
their
fellows
ascribes
a
controlling
influence
over
the
general
course
of
nature
such
men
are
accordingly
adored
and
treated
as
gods
whether
these
human
divinities
also
hold
temporal
sway
over
the
lives
and
fortunes
of
their
adorers
or
whether
their
functions
are
purely
spiritual
and
supernatural
in
other
words
whether
they
are
kings
as
well
as
gods
or
only
the
latter
is
a
distinction
which
hardly
concerns
us
here
their
supposed
divinity
is
the
essential
fact
with
which
we
have
to
deal
in
virtue
of
it
they
are
a
pledge
and
guarantee
to
their
worshippers
of
the
continuance
and
orderly
succession
of
those
physical
phenomena
upon
which
mankind
depends
for
subsistence
naturally
therefore
the
life
and
health
of
such
a
are
matters
of
anxious
concern
to
the
people
whose
welfare
and
even
existence
are
bound
up
with
his
naturally
he
is
constrained
by
them
to
conform
to
such
rules
as
the
wit
of
early
man
has
devised
for
averting
the
ills
to
which
flesh
is
heir
including
the
last
ill
death
these
rules
as
an
examination
of
them
has
shewn
are
nothing
but
the
maxims
with
which
on
the
primitive
view
every
man
of
common
prudence
must
comply
if
he
would
live
long
in
the
land
but
while
in
the
case
of
ordinary
men
the
observance
of
the
rules
is
left
to
the
choice
of
the
individual
in
the
case
of
the
it
is
enforced
under
penalty
of
dismissal
from
his
high
station
or
even
of
death
for
his
worshippers
have
far
too
great
a
stake
in
his
life
to
allow
him
to
play
fast
and
loose
with
it
therefore
all
the
quaint
superstitions
the
maxims
the
venerable
saws
which
the
ingenuity
of
savage
philosophers
elaborated
long
ago
and
which
old
women
at
chimney
corners
still
impart
as
treasures
of
great
price
to
their
descendants
gathered
round
the
cottage
fire
on
winter
these
antique
fancies
clustered
all
these
cobwebs
of
the
brain
were
spun
about
the
path
of
the
old
king
the
human
god
who
immeshed
in
them
like
a
fly
in
the
toils
of
a
spider
could
hardly
stir
a
limb
for
the
threads
of
custom
light
as
air
but
strong
as
links
of
iron
that
crossing
and
recrossing
each
other
in
an
endless
maze
bound
him
fast
within
a
network
of
observances
from
which
death
or
deposition
alone
could
release
him
thus
to
students
of
the
past
the
life
of
the
old
kings
and
priests
teems
with
instruction
in
it
was
summed
up
all
that
passed
for
wisdom
when
the
world
was
young
it
was
the
perfect
pattern
after
which
every
man
strove
to
shape
his
life
a
faultless
model
constructed
with
rigorous
accuracy
upon
the
lines
laid
down
by
a
barbarous
philosophy
crude
and
false
as
that
philosophy
may
seem
to
us
it
would
be
unjust
to
deny
it
the
merit
of
logical
consistency
starting
from
a
conception
of
the
vital
principle
as
a
tiny
being
or
soul
existing
in
but
distinct
and
separable
from
the
living
being
it
deduces
for
the
practical
guidance
of
life
a
system
of
rules
which
in
general
hangs
well
together
and
forms
a
fairly
complete
and
harmonious
whole
the
it
is
a
fatal
the
system
lies
not
in
its
reasoning
but
in
its
premises
in
its
conception
of
the
nature
of
life
not
in
any
irrelevancy
of
the
conclusions
which
it
draws
from
that
conception
but
to
stigmatise
these
premises
as
ridiculous
because
we
can
easily
detect
their
falseness
would
be
ungrateful
as
well
as
unphilosophical
we
stand
upon
the
foundation
reared
by
the
generations
that
have
gone
before
and
we
can
but
dimly
realise
the
painful
and
prolonged
efforts
which
it
has
cost
humanity
to
struggle
up
to
the
point
no
very
exalted
one
after
all
which
we
have
reached
our
gratitude
is
due
to
the
nameless
and
forgotten
toilers
whose
patient
thought
and
active
exertions
have
largely
made
us
what
we
are
the
amount
of
new
knowledge
which
one
age
certainly
which
one
man
can
add
to
the
common
store
is
small
and
it
argues
stupidity
or
dishonesty
besides
ingratitude
to
ignore
the
heap
while
vaunting
the
few
grains
which
it
may
have
been
our
privilege
to
add
to
it
there
is
indeed
little
danger
at
present
of
undervaluing
the
contributions
which
modern
times
and
even
classical
antiquity
have
made
to
the
general
advancement
of
our
race
but
when
we
pass
these
limits
the
case
is
different
contempt
and
ridicule
or
abhorrence
and
denunciation
are
too
often
the
only
recognition
vouchsafed
to
the
savage
and
his
ways
yet
of
the
benefactors
whom
we
are
bound
thankfully
to
commemorate
many
perhaps
most
were
savages
for
when
all
is
said
and
done
our
resemblances
to
the
savage
are
still
far
more
numerous
than
our
differences
from
him
and
what
we
have
in
common
with
him
and
deliberately
retain
as
true
and
useful
we
owe
to
our
savage
forefathers
who
slowly
acquired
by
experience
and
transmitted
to
us
by
inheritance
those
seemingly
fundamental
ideas
which
we
are
apt
to
regard
as
original
and
intuitive
we
are
like
heirs
to
a
fortune
which
has
been
handed
down
for
so
many
ages
that
the
memory
of
those
who
built
it
up
is
lost
and
its
possessors
for
the
time
being
regard
it
as
having
been
an
original
and
unalterable
possession
of
their
race
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
but
reflection
and
enquiry
should
satisfy
us
that
to
our
predecessors
we
are
indebted
for
much
of
what
we
thought
most
our
own
and
that
their
errors
were
not
wilful
extravagances
or
the
ravings
of
insanity
but
simply
hypotheses
justifiable
as
such
at
the
time
when
they
were
propounded
but
which
a
fuller
experience
has
proved
to
be
inadequate
it
is
only
by
the
successive
testing
of
hypotheses
and
rejection
of
the
false
that
truth
is
at
last
elicited
after
all
what
we
call
truth
is
only
the
hypothesis
which
is
found
to
work
best
therefore
in
reviewing
the
opinions
and
practices
of
ruder
ages
and
races
we
shall
do
well
to
look
with
leniency
upon
their
errors
as
inevitable
slips
made
in
the
search
for
truth
and
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
that
indulgence
which
we
ourselves
may
one
day
stand
in
need
of
excusatione
itaque
veteres

note
not
to
step
over
persons
and
things
the
superstition
that
harm
is
done
to
a
person
or
thing
by
stepping
over
him
or
it
is
very
widely
spread
thus
the
galelareese
think
that
if
a
man
steps
over
your
or
your
arrow
the
fish
will
not
bite
when
you
fish
with
that
rod
and
the
game
will
not
be
hit
by
that
arrow
when
you
shoot
it
they
say
it
is
as
if
the
implements
merely
skimmed
past
the
fish
or
the
game
similarly
if
a
highland
sportsman
saw
a
person
stepping
over
his
gun
or
he
presumed
but
little
on
that
day
s
diversion
when
a
dacota
had
bad
luck
in
hunting
he
would
say
that
a
woman
had
been
stepping
over
some
part
of
the
animal
which
he
revered
amongst
many
south
african
tribes
it
is
considered
highly
improper
to
step
over
a
sleeper
if
a
wife
steps
over
her
husband
he
can
not
hit
his
enemy
in
war
if
she
steps
over
his
assegais
they
are
from
that
time
useless
and
are
given
to
boys

that
if

steps
over

they
will
not

the

hold
that
to

over

snare
or

is
to
court
death
and

be
avoided
at
all
risks
further
they
are
of
opinion
that
if
a
man
were
to
step
over
a
pot
he
would
fall
to
pieces
whenever
the
pot
were
broken
the
people
of
the
lower
congo
deem
that
to
step
over
a
person
s
body
or
legs
will
cause
to
that
person
and
they
are
careful
not
to
do
so
especially
in
passing

are
holding

such
times

will
shuffle
his

that

was
titular
rather
than
real
and
he
adds
i
am
not
aware
that
any
specific
miraculous
powers
were
authoritatively
claimed
for
them
no
doubt
it
is
very
difficult
for
the
western
mind
to
put
itself
at
the
point
of
view
of
the
oriental
and
to
seize
the
precise
point
if
it
can
be
said
to
exist
where
the
divine
fades
into
the
human
or
the
human
brightens
into
the
divine
in
translating
as
we
must
do
the
vague
thought
of
a
crude
theology
into
the
comparatively
exact
language
of
civilised
europe
we
must
allow
for
a
considerable
want
of
correspondence
between
the
two
we
must
leave
between
them

that

peoples
was
based

motive
to
convince
us

this
it
is
enough
to
remark
that
the
rule
is
often

victorious
return

also
by
the
persons
left

cases
the
observance
of
the
rule

does
not
admit
of

rational
explanation

could
hardly
indeed
be

native
explanation
of
these
esquimau
taboos
the
object
of
the
taboos
observed
after
killing
is
to
prevent
the
souls
of
the
slain
animals
from
contracting
certain
attachments
which
would
hurt
not
only
them
but
also
the
great
goddess
sedna
in
whose
house
the
disembodied
souls
of
the
reside
the
souls
of
the
have
a
great
aversion
to
the
dark
colour
of
death
and
to
the
vapour
that
arises
from
flowing
blood
and
they
avoid
persons
who
are
affected
by
these
things
the
transgresser
of
a
taboo
must
announce
his
transgression
in
order
that
other
people
may
shun
him
hence
the
central
esquimaux
have
come
to
think
that
sin
can
be
atoned
for
by
confession
that
is
the
wizard
or
sorcerer
the
transgression
of
taboos
affects
the
soul
of
the
transgressor
becoming
attached
to
it
and
making
him
sick
if
the
attachment
is
not
removed
by
the
wizard
the
man
will
die
that
is
the
wizard

the
esquimaux

to
keep
the

the

struck
most
europeans

the

greek
inscription
discovered
some
years
ago
we
learn
that
no
person
might
enter
the
sanctuary
of
the
mistress
at
lycosura
wearing
golden
trinkets
unless
for
the
purpose
of
dedicating
them
to
the
goddess
and
if
any
one
did
enter
the
holy
place
with
such
ornaments
on
his
body
but
no
such
pious
intention
in
his
mind
the
trinkets
were
forfeited
to
the
use
of
religion
see
ἐφημερὶς

no
the
similar
rule
that
in
the
procession
at
the
mysteries
of
andania
no
woman
might
wear
golden
ornaments
dittenberger
no
was
probably
subject
to
a
similar
exception
and
enforced
by
a
similar
penalty
once
more
if
the
maidens
who
served
athena
on
the
acropolis
at
athens
put
on
gold
ornaments
the
ornaments
became
sacred
in
other
words
the
property
of
the
goddess
harpocration

vol
ed
dindorf
thus
it
appears
that
the
pious
scruple
about
gold
was
concerned
rather
with
its
exit
from
than
with
its
entrance
into
the
sacred
edifice
at
the
sacrifice
to
the
sun
in
ancient
egypt
worshippers
were
forbidden
to
wear
golden
trinkets

that

the
case
is
not
clear
but
both
the
evidence
and
the
probability
seem
to
me
in
favour
of
the
view
that
it
was
rather
the
old
everyday
name
of
the
priest
or
priestess
which
was
put
away
at
his
or
her
consecration
if
as
is
not
improbable
these
sacred
personages
had
to
act
the
parts
of
gods
and
goddesses
at
the
mysteries
it
might
well
be
deemed
indecorous
and
even
blasphemous
to
recall
the
vulgar
names
by
which
they
had
been
known
in
the
familiar
intercourse
of
daily
life
if
our
clergy
to
suppose
an
analogous
case
had
to
personate
the
most
exalted
beings
of

history
it
would
surely
be
grossly
irreverent

address

the

if
as
the
people
of

believe
all
nature

teeming
with

some
spiritual
weapon
is
necessary

against

now
the
chief
and
most

weapon
of
the
malay

the
tiger

symbol

oppression
still
he
is

must
not

human

whom
the

community
is
believed
to

are
obliged
to
observe
many
rules
to
ensure
their
own
safety
and
that
of

a
study
of
these
rules
affords
us
an
insight
into
the
philosophy
of
the
savage
our
debt
to
our
savage
forefathers
the
mind
of
the
savage
is
not
a
blank
and
when
one
becomes
familiar
with
his
beliefs
and
superstitions
and
the
complicated
nature
of
his
laws
and
customs
preconceived
notions
of
his
simplicity
of
thought
go
to
the
winds
i
have
yet
to
find
that
most
apocryphal
of
beings
described
as
the
unsophisticated
we
laugh
at
and
ridicule
his
fetishes
and
superstitions
but
we
fail
to
follow
the
succession
of
ideas
and
effort
of
mind
which
have
created
these
things
after
most
careful
observations
extending
over
nineteen
years
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
customs
and
fetishes
of
the
african
which
does
not
represent
a
definite
course
of
reasoning

the
study
of
primitive
peoples
is
extremely
curious
and
full
of
surprises
it
is
twenty
years
since
i
undertook
it
among
the
thonga
and
pedi
tribes
of
south
africa
and
the
further

advance
the
more
i
am
astonished
at
the
great
number
the
complexity
and
the
profundity
of
the
rites
of
these
savages
only
a
superficial
observer
could
accuse
their
individual
or
tribal
life
of
superficiality
if
we
take
the
trouble
to
seek
the
reason
of
these
strange
customs
we
perceive
that
at
their
base
there
are
secret
obscure
reasons
principles
hard
to
grasp
even
though
the
most
fervent
adepts
of
the
rite
can
give
no
account
of
it
to
discover
these
principles
and
so
to
give
a
true
explanation
of
the
rites
is
the
supreme
task
of
the
ethnographer
task
in
the
highest
degree
delicate
for
it
is
impossible
to
perform
it
if
we
do
not
lay
aside
our
personal
ideas
to
saturate
ourselves

these
weighty
words
the
fruit
of
ripe
experience
deserve
to
be
pondered
by
those
who
fancy
that
the
elaborate
system
of
savage
custom
can
have
grown
up
instinctively
without
a
correspondingly
elaborate
process
of
reasoning
in
the
minds
of
its
founders
we
may
not
indeed
always
be
able
to
discover
the
reason
for
which
a
particular
custom
or
rite
was
instituted
for
we
are
only
beginning
to
understand
the
mind
of
uncivilised
man
but
all
that
we
know
of
him
tends
to
shew
that
his
practice
however
absurd
it
may
seem
to
us
originated
in
a
definite
train
of
thought
and
for
a
definite
and
