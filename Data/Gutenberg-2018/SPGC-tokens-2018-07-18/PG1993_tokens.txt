a
personal
explanation
my
own
story
introductory
it
was
christmas
eve
i
begin
this
way
because
it
is
the
proper
orthodox
respectable
way
to
begin
and
i
have
been
brought
up
in
a
proper
orthodox
respectable
way
and
taught
to
always
do
the
proper
orthodox
respectable
thing
and
the
habit
clings
to
me
of
course
as
a
mere
matter
of
information
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
mention
the
date
at
all
the
experienced
reader
knows
it
was
christmas
eve
without
my
telling
him
it
always
is
christmas
eve
in
a
ghost
story
christmas
eve
is
the
ghosts
great
gala
night
on
christmas
eve
they
hold
their
annual
fete
on
christmas
eve
everybody
in
ghostland
who
is
anybody
or
rather
speaking
of
ghosts
one
should
say
i
suppose
every
nobody
who
is
any
nobody
comes
out
to
show
himself
or
herself
to
see
and
to
be
seen
to
promenade
about
and
display
their
and
to
each
other
to
criticise
one
another
style
and
sneer
at
one
complexion
christmas
eve
parade
as
i
expect
they
themselves
term
it
is
a
function
doubtless
eagerly
prepared
for
and
looked
forward
to
throughout
ghostland
especially
the
swagger
set
such
as
the
murdered
barons
the
countesses
and
the
earls
who
came
over
with
the
conqueror
and
assassinated
their
relatives
and
died
raving
mad
hollow
moans
and
fiendish
grins
are
one
may
be
sure
energetically
practised
up
shrieks
and
gestures
are
probably
rehearsed
for
weeks
beforehand
rusty
chains
and
gory
daggers
are
and
put
into
good
working
order
and
sheets
and
shrouds
laid
carefully
by
from
the
previous
show
are
taken
down
and
shaken
out
and
mended
and
aired
oh
it
is
a
stirring
night
in
ghostland
the
night
of
december
the
ghosts
never
come
out
on
christmas
night
itself
you
may
have
noticed
christmas
eve
we
suspect
has
been
too
much
for
them
they
are
not
used
to
excitement
for
about
a
week
after
christmas
eve
the
gentlemen
ghosts
no
doubt
feel
as
if
they
were
all
head
and
go
about
making
solemn
resolutions
to
themselves
that
they
will
stop
in
next
christmas
eve
while
lady
spectres
are
contradictory
and
snappish
and
liable
to
burst
into
tears
and
leave
the
room
hurriedly
on
being
spoken
to
for
no
perceptible
cause
whatever
ghosts
with
no
position
to
maintain
mere
ghosts
occasionally
i
believe
do
a
little
haunting
on
on
eve
and
at
midsummer
and
some
will
even
run
up
for
a
mere
local
event
to
celebrate
for
instance
the
anniversary
of
the
hanging
of
somebody
grandfather
or
to
prophesy
a
misfortune
he
does
love
prophesying
a
misfortune
does
the
average
british
ghost
send
him
out
to
prognosticate
trouble
to
somebody
and
he
is
happy
let
him
force
his
way
into
a
peaceful
home
and
turn
the
whole
house
upside
down
by
foretelling
a
funeral
or
predicting
a
bankruptcy
or
hinting
at
a
coming
disgrace
or
some
other
terrible
disaster
about
which
nobody
in
their
senses
would
want
to
know
sooner
than
they
could
possibly
help
and
the
prior
knowledge
of
which
can
serve
no
useful
purpose
whatsoever
and
he
feels
that
he
is
combining
duty
with
pleasure
he
would
never
forgive
himself
if
anybody
in
his
family
had
a
trouble
and
he
had
not
been
there
for
a
couple
of
months
beforehand
doing
silly
tricks
on
the
lawn
or
balancing
himself
on
somebody
then
there
are
besides
the
very
young
or
very
conscientious
ghosts
with
a
lost
will
or
an
undiscovered
number
weighing
heavy
on
their
minds
who
will
haunt
steadily
all
the
year
round
and
also
the
fussy
ghost
who
is
indignant
at
having
been
buried
in
the
or
in
the
village
pond
and
who
never
gives
the
parish
a
single
night
quiet
until
somebody
has
paid
for
a
funeral
for
him
but
these
are
the
exceptions
as
i
have
said
the
average
orthodox
ghost
does
his
one
turn
a
year
on
christmas
eve
and
is
satisfied
why
on
christmas
eve
of
all
nights
in
the
year
i
never
could
myself
understand
it
is
invariably
one
of
the
most
dismal
of
nights
to
be
out
in
cold
muddy
and
wet
and
besides
at
christmas
time
everybody
has
quite
enough
to
put
up
with
in
the
way
of
a
houseful
of
living
relations
without
wanting
the
ghosts
of
any
dead
ones
mooning
about
the
place
i
am
sure
there
must
be
something
ghostly
in
the
air
of
christmas
something
about
the
close
muggy
atmosphere
that
draws
up
the
ghosts
like
the
dampness
of
the
summer
rains
brings
out
the
frogs
and
snails
and
not
only
do
the
ghosts
themselves
always
walk
on
christmas
eve
but
live
people
always
sit
and
talk
about
them
on
christmas
eve
whenever
five
or
six
people
meet
round
a
fire
on
christmas
eve
they
start
telling
each
other
ghost
stories
nothing
satisfies
us
on
christmas
eve
but
to
hear
each
other
tell
authentic
anecdotes
about
spectres
it
is
a
genial
festive
season
and
we
love
to
muse
upon
graves
and
dead
bodies
and
murders
and
blood
there
is
a
good
deal
of
similarity
about
our
ghostly
experiences
but
this
of
course
is
not
our
fault
but
the
fault
of
ghosts
who
never
will
try
any
new
performances
but
always
will
keep
steadily
to
old
safe
business
the
consequence
is
that
when
you
have
been
at
one
christmas
eve
party
and
heard
six
people
relate
their
adventures
with
spirits
you
do
not
require
to
hear
any
more
ghost
stories
to
listen
to
any
further
ghost
stories
after
that
would
be
like
sitting
out
two
farcical
comedies
or
taking
in
two
comic
journals
the
repetition
would
become
wearisome
there
is
always
the
young
man
who
was
one
year
spending
the
christmas
at
a
country
house
and
on
christmas
eve
they
put
him
to
sleep
in
the
west
wing
then
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
room
door
quietly
opens
and
somebody
generally
a
lady
in
her
walks
slowly
in
and
comes
and
sits
on
the
bed
the
young
man
thinks
it
must
be
one
of
the
visitors
or
some
relative
of
the
family
though
he
does
not
remember
having
previously
seen
her
who
unable
to
go
to
sleep
and
feeling
lonesome
all
by
herself
has
come
into
his
room
for
a
chat
he
has
no
idea
it
is
a
ghost
he
is
so
unsuspicious
she
does
not
speak
however
and
when
he
looks
again
she
is
gone
the
young
man
relates
the
circumstance
at
the
next
morning
and
asks
each
of
the
ladies
present
if
it
were
she
who
was
his
visitor
but
they
all
assure
him
that
it
was
not
and
the
host
who
has
grown
deadly
pale
begs
him
to
say
no
more
about
the
matter
which
strikes
the
young
man
as
a
singularly
strange
request
after
breakfast
the
host
takes
the
young
man
into
a
corner
and
explains
to
him
that
what
he
saw
was
the
ghost
of
a
lady
who
had
been
murdered
in
that
very
bed
or
who
had
murdered
somebody
else
there
it
does
not
really
matter
which
you
can
be
a
ghost
by
murdering
somebody
else
or
by
being
murdered
yourself
whichever
you
prefer
the
murdered
ghost
is
perhaps
the
more
popular
but
on
the
other
hand
you
can
frighten
people
better
if
you
are
the
murdered
one
because
then
you
can
show
your
wounds
and
do
groans
then
there
is
the
sceptical
guest
it
is
always
guest
who
gets
let
in
for
this
sort
of
thing
a
ghost
never
thinks
much
of
his
own
family
it
is
guest
he
likes
to
haunt
who
after
listening
to
the
host
ghost
story
on
christmas
eve
laughs
at
it
and
says
that
he
does
not
believe
there
are
such
things
as
ghosts
at
all
and
that
he
will
sleep
in
the
haunted
chamber
that
very
night
if
they
will
let
him
everybody
urges
him
not
to
be
reckless
but
he
persists
in
his
foolhardiness
and
goes
up
to
the
yellow
chamber
or
whatever
colour
the
haunted
room
may
be
with
a
light
heart
and
a
candle
and
wishes
them
all
and
shuts
the
door
next
morning
he
has
got
hair
he
does
not
tell
anybody
what
he
has
seen
it
is
too
awful
there
is
also
the
plucky
guest
who
sees
a
ghost
and
knows
it
is
a
ghost
and
watches
it
as
it
comes
into
the
room
and
disappears
through
the
wainscot
after
which
as
the
ghost
does
not
seem
to
be
coming
back
and
there
is
nothing
consequently
to
be
gained
by
stopping
awake
he
goes
to
sleep
he
does
not
mention
having
seen
the
ghost
to
anybody
for
fear
of
frightening
them
some
people
are
so
nervous
about
ghosts
but
determines
to
wait
for
the
next
night
and
see
if
the
apparition
appears
again
it
does
appear
again
and
this
time
he
gets
out
of
bed
dresses
himself
and
does
his
hair
and
follows
it
and
then
discovers
a
secret
passage
leading
from
the
bedroom
down
into
the
passage
which
no
doubt
was
not
unfrequently
made
use
of
in
the
bad
old
days
of
yore
after
him
comes
the
young
man
who
woke
up
with
a
strange
sensation
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
found
his
rich
bachelor
uncle
standing
by
his
bedside
the
rich
uncle
smiled
a
weird
sort
of
smile
and
vanished
the
young
man
immediately
got
up
and
looked
at
his
watch
it
had
stopped
at
four
he
having
forgotten
to
wind
it
he
made
inquiries
the
next
day
and
found
that
strangely
enough
his
rich
uncle
whose
only
nephew
he
was
had
married
a
widow
with
eleven
children
at
exactly
a
quarter
to
twelve
only
two
days
ago
the
young
man
does
not
attempt
to
explain
the
circumstance
all
he
does
is
to
vouch
for
the
truth
of
his
narrative
and
to
mention
another
case
there
is
the
gentleman
who
is
returning
home
late
at
night
from
a
freemasons
dinner
and
who
noticing
a
light
issuing
from
a
ruined
abbey
creeps
up
and
looks
through
the
keyhole
he
sees
the
ghost
of
a
sister
kissing
the
ghost
of
a
brown
monk
and
is
so
inexpressibly
shocked
and
frightened
that
he
faints
on
the
spot
and
is
discovered
there
the
next
morning
lying
in
a
heap
against
the
door
still
speechless
and
with
his
faithful
clasped
tightly
in
his
hand
all
these
things
happen
on
christmas
eve
they
are
all
told
of
on
christmas
eve
for
ghost
stories
to
be
told
on
any
other
evening
than
the
evening
of
the
of
december
would
be
impossible
in
english
society
as
at
present
regulated
therefore
in
introducing
the
sad
but
authentic
ghost
stories
that
follow
hereafter
i
feel
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
inform
the
student
of
literature
that
the
date
on
which
they
were
told
and
on
which
the
incidents
took
place
was
christmas
eve
nevertheless
i
do
so
now
the
stories
came
to
be
told
it
was
christmas
eve
christmas
eve
at
my
uncle
john
christmas
eve
there
is
too
much
eve
about
this
book
i
can
see
that
myself
it
is
beginning
to
get
monotonous
even
to
me
but
i
do
see
how
to
avoid
it
now
at
no
laburnham
grove
tooting
christmas
eve
in
the
there
was
a
on
front
parlour
where
the
flickering
threw
strange
shadows
on
the
highly
coloured
while
without
in
the
wild
street
the
storm
raged
pitilessly
and
the
wind
like
some
unquiet
spirit
flew
moaning
across
the
square
and
passed
wailing
with
a
troubled
cry
round
by
the
we
had
had
supper
and
were
sitting
round
talking
and
smoking
we
had
had
a
very
good
supper
a
very
good
supper
indeed
unpleasantness
has
occurred
since
in
our
family
in
connection
with
this
party
rumours
have
been
put
about
in
our
family
concerning
the
matter
generally
but
more
particularly
concerning
my
own
share
in
it
and
remarks
have
been
passed
which
have
not
so
much
surprised
me
because
i
know
what
our
family
are
but
which
have
pained
me
very
much
as
for
my
aunt
maria
i
do
not
know
when
i
shall
care
to
see
her
again
i
should
have
thought
aunt
maria
might
have
known
me
better
but
although
injustice
gross
injustice
as
i
shall
explain
later
on
has
been
done
to
myself
that
shall
not
deter
me
from
doing
justice
to
others
even
to
those
who
have
made
unfeeling
insinuations
i
will
do
justice
to
aunt
maria
hot
veal
pasties
and
toasted
lobsters
followed
by
her
own
special
make
of
cheesecakes
warm
there
is
no
sense
to
my
thinking
in
cold
cheesecakes
you
lose
half
the
flavour
and
washed
down
by
uncle
john
own
particular
old
ale
and
acknowledge
that
they
were
most
tasty
i
did
justice
to
them
then
aunt
maria
herself
could
not
but
admit
that
after
supper
uncle
brewed
some
i
did
justice
to
that
also
uncle
john
himself
said
so
he
said
he
was
glad
to
notice
that
i
liked
it
aunt
went
to
bed
soon
after
supper
leaving
the
local
curate
old
scrubbles
samuel
coombes
our
member
of
the
county
council
teddy
biffles
and
myself
to
keep
uncle
company
we
agreed
that
it
was
too
early
to
give
in
for
some
time
yet
so
uncle
brewed
another
bowl
of
punch
and
i
think
we
all
did
justice
to
that
at
least
i
know
i
did
it
is
a
passion
with
me
is
the
desire
to
do
justice
we
sat
up
for
a
long
while
and
the
doctor
brewed
some
later
on
for
a
change
though
i
could
not
taste
much
difference
myself
but
it
was
all
good
and
we
were
very
happy
everybody
was
so
kind
uncle
john
told
us
a
very
funny
story
in
the
course
of
the
evening
oh
it
was
a
funny
story
i
forget
what
it
was
about
now
but
i
know
it
amused
me
very
much
at
the
time
i
do
not
think
i
ever
laughed
so
much
in
all
my
life
it
is
strange
that
i
can
not
recollect
that
story
too
because
he
told
it
us
four
times
and
it
was
entirely
our
own
fault
that
he
did
not
tell
it
us
a
fifth
after
that
the
doctor
sang
a
very
clever
song
in
the
course
of
which
he
imitated
all
the
different
animals
in
a
farmyard
he
did
mix
them
a
bit
he
brayed
for
the
bantam
cock
and
crowed
for
the
pig
but
we
knew
what
he
meant
all
right
i
started
relating
a
most
interesting
anecdote
but
was
somewhat
surprised
to
observe
as
i
went
on
that
nobody
was
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
me
whatever
i
thought
this
rather
rude
of
them
at
first
until
it
dawned
upon
me
that
i
was
talking
to
myself
all
the
time
instead
of
out
aloud
so
that
of
course
they
did
not
know
that
i
was
telling
them
a
tale
at
all
and
were
probably
puzzled
to
understand
the
meaning
of
my
animated
expression
and
eloquent
gestures
it
was
a
most
curious
mistake
for
any
one
to
make
i
never
knew
such
a
thing
happen
to
me
before
later
on
our
curate
did
tricks
with
cards
he
asked
us
if
we
had
ever
seen
a
game
called
the
three
card
trick
he
said
it
was
an
artifice
by
means
of
which
low
unscrupulous
men
frequenters
of
and
such
like
haunts
swindled
foolish
young
fellows
out
of
their
money
he
said
it
was
a
very
simple
trick
to
do
it
all
depended
on
the
quickness
of
the
hand
it
was
the
quickness
of
the
hand
deceived
the
eye
he
said
he
would
show
us
the
imposture
so
that
we
might
be
warned
against
it
and
not
be
taken
in
by
it
and
he
fetched
uncle
pack
of
cards
from
the
and
selecting
three
cards
from
the
pack
two
plain
cards
and
one
picture
card
sat
down
on
the
hearthrug
and
explained
to
us
what
he
was
going
to
do
he
said
now
i
shall
take
these
three
cards
in
my
hand
so
and
let
you
all
see
them
and
then
i
shall
quietly
lay
them
down
on
the
rug
with
the
backs
uppermost
and
ask
you
to
pick
out
the
picture
card
and
you
think
you
know
which
one
it
is
and
he
did
it
old
coombes
who
is
also
one
of
our
churchwardens
said
it
was
the
middle
card
you
fancy
you
saw
it
said
our
curate
smiling
i
do
anything
at
all
about
it
replied
coombes
i
tell
you
it
the
middle
card
i
bet
you
half
a
dollar
it
the
middle
card
there
you
are
that
just
what
i
was
explaining
to
you
said
our
curate
turning
to
the
rest
of
us
that
the
way
these
foolish
young
fellows
that
i
was
speaking
of
are
lured
on
to
lose
their
money
they
make
sure
they
know
the
card
they
fancy
they
saw
it
they
do
grasp
the
idea
that
it
is
the
quickness
of
the
hand
that
has
deceived
their
eye
he
said
he
had
known
young
men
go
off
to
a
boat
race
or
a
cricket
match
with
pounds
in
their
pocket
and
come
home
early
in
the
afternoon
stone
broke
having
lost
all
their
money
at
this
demoralising
game
he
said
he
should
take
coombes
because
it
would
teach
coombes
a
very
useful
lesson
and
probably
be
the
means
of
saving
coombes
money
in
the
future
and
he
should
give
the
to
the
blanket
fund
do
you
worry
about
that
retorted
old
coombes
do
you
take
the
out
of
the
blanket
fund
that
all
and
he
put
his
money
on
the
middle
card
and
turned
it
up
sure
enough
it
really
was
the
queen
we
were
all
very
much
surprised
especially
the
curate
he
said
that
it
did
sometimes
happen
that
way
though
that
a
man
did
sometimes
lay
on
the
right
card
by
accident
our
curate
said
it
was
however
the
most
unfortunate
thing
a
man
could
do
for
himself
if
he
only
knew
it
because
when
a
man
tried
and
won
it
gave
him
a
taste
for
the
sport
and
it
lured
him
on
into
risking
again
and
again
until
he
had
to
retire
from
the
contest
a
broken
and
ruined
man
then
he
did
the
trick
again
coombes
said
it
was
the
card
next
the
this
time
and
wanted
to
put
five
shillings
on
it
we
laughed
at
him
and
tried
to
persuade
him
against
it
he
would
listen
to
no
advice
however
but
insisted
on
plunging
our
curate
said
very
well
then
he
had
warned
him
and
that
was
all
that
he
could
do
if
he
coombes
was
determined
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
he
coombes
must
do
so
our
curate
said
he
should
take
the
five
shillings
and
that
would
put
things
right
again
with
the
blanket
fund
so
coombes
put
two
on
the
card
next
the
scuttle
and
turned
it
up
sure
enough
it
was
the
queen
again
after
that
uncle
john
had
a
florin
on
and
he
won
and
then
we
all
played
at
it
and
we
all
won
all
except
the
curate
that
is
he
had
a
very
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
i
never
knew
a
man
have
such
hard
luck
at
cards
he
lost
every
time
we
had
some
more
punch
after
that
and
uncle
made
such
a
funny
mistake
in
brewing
it
he
left
out
the
whisky
oh
we
did
laugh
at
him
and
we
made
him
put
in
double
quantity
afterwards
as
a
forfeit
oh
we
did
have
such
fun
that
evening
and
then
somehow
or
other
we
must
have
got
on
to
ghosts
because
the
next
recollection
i
have
is
that
we
were
telling
ghost
stories
to
each
other
teddy
biffles
story
teddy
biffles
told
the
first
story
i
will
let
him
repeat
it
here
in
his
own
words
do
not
ask
me
how
it
is
that
i
recollect
his
own
exact
words
whether
i
took
them
down
in
shorthand
at
the
time
or
whether
he
had
the
story
written
out
and
handed
me
the
afterwards
for
publication
in
this
book
because
i
should
not
tell
you
if
you
did
it
is
a
trade
secret
biffles
called
his
story
johnson
and
emily
or
the
faithful
ghost
teddy
biffles
story
i
was
little
more
than
a
lad
when
i
first
met
with
johnson
i
was
home
for
the
christmas
holidays
and
it
being
christmas
eve
i
had
been
allowed
to
sit
up
very
late
on
opening
the
door
of
my
little
bedroom
to
go
in
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
johnson
who
was
coming
out
it
passed
through
me
and
uttering
a
long
low
wail
of
misery
disappeared
out
of
the
staircase
window
i
was
startled
for
the
moment
i
was
only
a
schoolboy
at
the
time
and
had
never
seen
a
ghost
before
and
felt
a
little
nervous
about
going
to
bed
but
on
reflection
i
remembered
that
it
was
only
sinful
people
that
spirits
could
do
any
harm
to
and
so
tucked
myself
up
and
went
to
sleep
in
the
morning
i
told
the
pater
what
i
had
seen
oh
yes
that
was
old
johnson
he
answered
do
you
be
frightened
of
that
he
lives
here
and
then
he
told
me
the
poor
thing
history
it
seemed
that
johnson
when
it
was
alive
had
loved
in
early
life
the
daughter
of
a
former
lessee
of
our
house
a
very
beautiful
girl
whose
christian
name
had
been
emily
father
did
not
know
her
other
name
johnson
was
too
poor
to
marry
the
girl
so
he
kissed
her
told
her
he
would
soon
be
back
and
went
off
to
australia
to
make
his
fortune
but
australia
was
not
then
what
it
became
later
on
travellers
through
the
bush
were
few
and
far
between
in
those
early
days
and
even
when
one
was
caught
the
portable
property
found
upon
the
body
was
often
of
hardly
sufficiently
negotiable
value
to
pay
the
simple
funeral
expenses
rendered
necessary
so
that
it
took
johnson
nearly
twenty
years
to
make
his
fortune
the
task
was
accomplished
at
last
however
and
then
having
successfully
eluded
the
police
and
got
clear
out
of
the
colony
he
returned
to
england
full
of
hope
and
joy
to
claim
his
bride
he
reached
the
house
to
find
it
silent
and
deserted
all
that
the
neighbours
could
tell
him
was
that
soon
after
his
own
departure
the
family
had
on
one
foggy
night
unostentatiously
disappeared
and
that
nobody
had
ever
seen
or
heard
anything
of
them
since
although
the
landlord
and
most
of
the
local
tradesmen
had
made
searching
inquiries
poor
johnson
frenzied
with
grief
sought
his
lost
love
all
over
the
world
but
he
never
found
her
and
after
years
of
fruitless
effort
he
returned
to
end
his
lonely
life
in
the
very
house
where
in
the
happy
bygone
days
he
and
his
beloved
emily
had
passed
so
many
blissful
hours
he
had
lived
there
quite
alone
wandering
about
the
empty
rooms
weeping
and
calling
to
his
emily
to
come
back
to
him
and
when
the
poor
old
fellow
died
his
ghost
still
kept
the
business
on
it
was
there
the
pater
said
when
he
took
the
house
and
the
agent
had
knocked
ten
pounds
a
year
off
the
rent
in
consequence
after
that
i
was
continually
meeting
johnson
about
the
place
at
all
times
of
the
night
and
so
indeed
were
we
all
we
used
to
walk
round
it
and
stand
aside
to
let
it
pass
at
first
but
when
we
grew
at
home
with
it
and
there
seemed
no
necessity
for
so
much
ceremony
we
used
to
walk
straight
through
it
you
could
not
say
it
was
ever
much
in
the
way
it
was
a
gentle
harmless
old
ghost
too
and
we
all
felt
very
sorry
for
it
and
pitied
it
the
women
folk
indeed
made
quite
a
pet
of
it
for
a
while
its
faithfulness
touched
them
so
but
as
time
went
on
it
grew
to
be
a
bit
of
a
bore
you
see
it
was
full
of
sadness
there
was
nothing
cheerful
or
genial
about
it
you
felt
sorry
for
it
but
it
irritated
you
it
would
sit
on
the
stairs
and
cry
for
hours
at
a
stretch
and
whenever
we
woke
up
in
the
night
one
was
sure
to
hear
it
pottering
about
the
passages
and
in
and
out
of
the
different
rooms
moaning
and
sighing
so
that
we
could
not
get
to
sleep
again
very
easily
and
when
we
had
a
party
on
it
would
come
and
sit
outside
the
door
and
sob
all
the
time
it
did
not
do
anybody
any
harm
exactly
but
it
cast
a
gloom
over
the
whole
affair
oh
i
getting
sick
of
this
old
fool
said
the
pater
one
evening
the
dad
can
be
very
blunt
when
he
is
put
out
as
you
know
after
johnson
had
been
more
of
a
nuisance
than
usual
and
had
spoiled
a
good
game
of
whist
by
sitting
up
the
chimney
and
groaning
till
nobody
knew
what
were
trumps
or
what
suit
had
been
led
even
we
shall
have
to
get
rid
of
him
somehow
or
other
i
wish
i
knew
how
to
do
it
well
said
the
mater
depend
upon
it
you
never
see
the
last
of
him
until
he
found
emily
grave
that
what
he
is
after
you
find
emily
grave
and
put
him
on
to
that
and
he
stop
there
that
the
only
thing
to
do
you
mark
my
words
the
idea
seemed
reasonable
but
the
difficulty
in
the
way
was
that
we
none
of
us
knew
where
emily
grave
was
any
more
than
the
ghost
of
johnson
himself
did
the
governor
suggested
palming
off
some
other
emily
grave
upon
the
poor
thing
but
as
luck
would
have
it
there
did
not
seem
to
have
been
an
emily
of
any
sort
buried
anywhere
for
miles
round
i
never
came
across
a
neighbourhood
so
utterly
destitute
of
dead
emilies
i
thought
for
a
bit
and
then
i
hazarded
a
suggestion
myself
could
we
fake
up
something
for
the
old
chap
i
queried
he
seems
a
old
sort
he
might
take
it
in
anyhow
we
could
but
try
by
jove
so
we
will
exclaimed
my
father
and
the
very
next
morning
we
had
the
workmen
in
and
fixed
up
a
little
mound
at
the
bottom
of
the
orchard
with
a
tombstone
over
it
bearing
the
following
inscription
sacred
to
the
memory
of
emily
her
last
words
were
tell
johnson
i
love
him
that
ought
to
fetch
him
mused
the
dad
as
he
surveyed
the
work
when
finished
i
am
sure
i
hope
it
does
it
did
we
lured
him
down
there
that
very
night
and
well
there
it
was
one
of
the
most
pathetic
things
i
have
ever
seen
the
way
johnson
sprang
upon
that
tombstone
and
wept
dad
and
old
squibbins
the
gardener
cried
like
children
when
they
saw
it
johnson
has
never
troubled
us
any
more
in
the
house
since
then
it
spends
every
night
now
sobbing
on
the
grave
and
seems
quite
happy
there
still
oh
yes
i
take
you
fellows
down
and
show
you
it
next
time
you
come
to
our
place
to
are
its
general
hours
to
on
saturdays
interlude
the
doctor
story
it
made
me
cry
very
much
that
story
young
biffles
told
it
with
so
much
feeling
we
were
all
a
little
thoughtful
after
it
and
i
noticed
even
the
old
doctor
covertly
wipe
away
a
tear
uncle
john
brewed
another
bowl
of
punch
however
and
we
gradually
grew
more
resigned
the
doctor
indeed
after
a
while
became
almost
cheerful
and
told
us
about
the
ghost
of
one
of
his
patients
i
can
not
give
you
his
story
i
wish
i
could
they
all
said
afterwards
that
it
was
the
best
of
the
lot
the
most
ghastly
and
terrible
but
i
could
not
make
any
sense
of
it
myself
it
seemed
so
incomplete
he
began
all
right
and
then
something
seemed
to
happen
and
then
he
was
finishing
it
i
can
not
make
out
what
he
did
with
the
middle
of
the
story
it
ended
up
i
know
however
with
somebody
finding
something
and
that
put
coombes
in
mind
of
a
very
curious
affair
that
took
place
at
an
old
mill
once
kept
by
his
coombes
said
he
would
tell
us
his
story
and
before
anybody
could
stop
him
he
had
begun
mr
coombes
said
the
story
was
called
the
haunted
mill
or
the
ruined
home
coombes
story
well
you
all
know
my
parkins
began
coombes
taking
the
long
clay
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
putting
it
behind
his
ear
we
did
not
know
his
but
we
said
we
did
so
as
to
save
time
and
you
know
of
course
that
he
once
took
a
lease
of
an
old
mill
in
surrey
and
went
to
live
there
now
you
must
know
that
years
ago
this
very
mill
had
been
occupied
by
a
wicked
old
miser
who
died
there
leaving
so
it
was
his
money
hidden
somewhere
about
the
place
naturally
enough
every
one
who
had
since
come
to
live
at
the
mill
had
tried
to
find
the
treasure
but
none
had
ever
succeeded
and
the
local
wiseacres
said
that
nobody
ever
would
unless
the
ghost
of
the
miserly
miller
should
one
day
take
a
fancy
to
one
of
the
tenants
and
disclose
to
him
the
secret
of
the
my
did
not
attach
much
importance
to
the
story
regarding
it
as
an
old
woman
tale
and
unlike
his
predecessors
made
no
attempt
whatever
to
discover
the
hidden
gold
unless
business
was
very
different
then
from
what
it
is
now
said
my
i
do
see
how
a
miller
could
very
well
have
saved
anything
however
much
of
a
miser
he
might
have
been
at
all
events
not
enough
to
make
it
worth
the
trouble
of
looking
for
it
still
he
could
not
altogether
get
rid
of
the
idea
of
that
treasure
one
night
he
went
to
bed
there
was
nothing
very
extraordinary
about
that
i
admit
he
often
did
go
to
bed
of
a
night
what
was
remarkable
however
was
that
exactly
as
the
clock
of
the
village
church
chimed
the
last
stroke
of
twelve
my
woke
up
with
a
start
and
felt
himself
quite
unable
to
go
to
sleep
again
joe
his
christian
name
was
joe
sat
up
in
bed
and
looked
around
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
something
stood
very
still
wrapped
in
shadow
it
moved
into
the
moonlight
and
then
my
saw
that
it
was
the
figure
of
a
wizened
little
old
man
in
and
a
in
an
instant
the
story
of
the
hidden
treasure
and
the
old
miser
flashed
across
his
mind
he
come
to
show
me
where
it
hid
thought
my
and
he
resolved
that
he
would
not
spend
all
this
money
on
himself
but
would
devote
a
small
percentage
of
it
towards
doing
good
to
others
the
apparition
moved
towards
the
door
my
put
on
his
trousers
and
followed
it
the
ghost
went
downstairs
into
the
kitchen
glided
over
and
stood
in
front
of
the
hearth
sighed
and
disappeared
next
morning
joe
had
a
couple
of
bricklayers
in
and
made
them
haul
out
the
stove
and
pull
down
the
chimney
while
he
stood
behind
with
a
in
which
to
put
the
gold
they
knocked
down
half
the
wall
and
never
found
so
much
as
a
penny
bit
my
did
not
know
what
to
think
the
next
night
the
old
man
appeared
again
and
again
led
the
way
into
the
kitchen
this
time
however
instead
of
going
to
the
fireplace
it
stood
more
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
sighed
there
oh
i
see
what
he
means
now
said
my
to
himself
it
under
the
floor
why
did
the
old
idiot
go
and
stand
up
against
the
stove
so
as
to
make
me
think
it
was
up
the
chimney
they
spent
the
next
day
in
taking
up
the
kitchen
floor
but
the
only
thing
they
found
was
a
fork
and
the
handle
of
that
was
broken
on
the
third
night
the
ghost
reappeared
quite
unabashed
and
for
a
third
time
made
for
the
kitchen
arrived
there
it
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
and
vanished
umph
he
do
seem
to
have
learned
much
sense
where
he
been
to
muttered
joe
as
he
trotted
back
to
bed
i
should
have
thought
he
might
have
done
that
at
first
still
there
seemed
no
doubt
now
where
the
treasure
lay
and
the
first
thing
after
breakfast
they
started
pulling
down
the
ceiling
they
got
every
inch
of
the
ceiling
down
and
they
took
up
the
boards
of
the
room
above
they
discovered
about
as
much
treasure
as
you
would
expect
to
find
in
an
empty
on
the
fourth
night
when
the
ghost
appeared
as
usual
my
was
so
wild
that
he
threw
his
boots
at
it
and
the
boots
passed
through
the
body
and
broke
a
on
the
fifth
night
when
joe
awoke
as
he
always
did
now
at
twelve
the
ghost
was
standing
in
a
dejected
attitude
looking
very
miserable
there
was
an
appealing
look
in
its
large
sad
eyes
that
quite
touched
my
after
all
he
thought
perhaps
the
silly
chap
doing
his
best
maybe
he
has
forgotten
where
he
really
did
put
it
and
is
trying
to
remember
i
give
him
another
chance
the
ghost
appeared
grateful
and
delighted
at
seeing
joe
prepare
to
follow
him
and
led
the
way
into
the
attic
pointed
to
the
ceiling
and
vanished
well
he
hit
it
this
time
i
do
hope
said
my
and
next
day
they
set
to
work
to
take
the
roof
off
the
place
it
took
them
three
days
to
get
the
roof
thoroughly
off
and
all
they
found
was
a
bird
nest
after
securing
which
they
covered
up
the
house
with
tarpaulins
to
keep
it
dry
you
might
have
thought
that
would
have
cured
the
poor
fellow
of
looking
for
treasure
but
it
did
he
said
there
must
be
something
in
it
all
or
the
ghost
would
never
keep
on
coming
as
it
did
and
that
having
gone
so
far
he
would
go
on
to
the
end
and
solve
the
mystery
cost
what
it
might
night
after
night
he
would
get
out
of
his
bed
and
follow
that
spectral
old
fraud
about
the
house
each
night
the
old
man
would
indicate
a
different
place
and
on
each
following
day
my
would
proceed
to
break
up
the
mill
at
the
point
indicated
and
look
for
the
treasure
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
there
was
not
a
room
in
the
mill
fit
to
live
in
every
wall
had
been
pulled
down
every
floor
had
been
taken
up
every
ceiling
had
had
a
hole
knocked
in
it
and
then
as
suddenly
as
they
had
begun
the
ghost
visits
ceased
and
my
was
left
in
peace
to
rebuild
the
place
at
his
leisure
what
induced
the
old
image
to
play
such
a
silly
trick
upon
a
family
man
and
a
ratepayer
ah
that
just
what
i
can
not
tell
you
some
said
that
the
ghost
of
the
wicked
old
man
had
done
it
to
punish
my
for
not
believing
in
him
at
first
while
others
held
that
the
apparition
was
probably
that
of
some
deceased
local
plumber
and
glazier
who
would
naturally
take
an
interest
in
seeing
a
house
knocked
about
and
spoilt
but
nobody
knew
anything
for
certain
interlude
we
had
some
more
punch
and
then
the
curate
told
us
a
story
i
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
the
curate
story
so
i
can
not
retail
it
to
you
we
none
of
us
could
make
head
or
tail
of
that
story
it
was
a
good
story
enough
so
far
as
material
went
there
seemed
to
be
an
enormous
amount
of
plot
and
enough
incident
to
have
made
a
dozen
novels
i
never
before
heard
a
story
containing
so
much
incident
nor
one
dealing
with
so
many
varied
characters
i
should
say
that
every
human
being
our
curate
had
ever
known
or
met
or
heard
of
was
brought
into
that
story
there
were
simply
hundreds
of
them
every
five
seconds
he
would
introduce
into
the
tale
a
completely
fresh
collection
of
characters
accompanied
by
a
brand
new
set
of
incidents
this
was
the
sort
of
story
it
was
well
then
my
uncle
went
into
the
garden
and
got
his
gun
but
of
course
it
was
there
and
scroggins
said
he
did
believe
it
did
believe
what
who
scroggins
scroggins
oh
why
he
was
the
other
man
you
know
it
was
his
wife
what
was
his
wife
what
she
got
to
do
with
it
why
that
what
i
telling
you
it
was
she
that
found
the
hat
she
come
up
with
her
cousin
to
london
her
cousin
was
my
and
the
other
niece
had
married
a
man
named
evans
and
evans
after
it
was
all
over
had
taken
the
box
round
to
jacobs
because
jacobs
father
had
seen
the
man
when
he
was
alive
and
when
he
was
dead
joseph
now
look
here
never
you
mind
evans
and
the
box
what
become
of
your
uncle
and
the
gun
the
gun
what
gun
why
the
gun
that
your
uncle
used
to
keep
in
the
garden
and
that
was
there
what
did
he
do
with
it
did
he
kill
any
of
these
people
with
it
these
jacobses
and
evanses
and
scrogginses
and
josephses
because
if
so
it
was
a
good
and
useful
work
and
we
should
enjoy
hearing
about
it
no
oh
no
how
could
he
he
had
been
built
up
alive
in
the
wall
you
know
and
when
edward
iv
spoke
to
the
abbot
about
it
my
sister
said
that
in
her
then
state
of
health
she
could
not
and
would
not
as
it
was
endangering
the
child
life
so
they
christened
it
horatio
after
her
own
son
who
had
been
killed
at
waterloo
before
he
was
born
and
lord
napier
himself
said
look
here
do
you
know
what
you
are
talking
about
we
asked
him
at
this
point
he
said
no
but
he
knew
it
was
every
word
of
it
true
because
his
aunt
had
seen
it
herself
whereupon
we
covered
him
over
with
the
tablecloth
and
he
went
to
sleep
and
then
uncle
told
us
a
story
uncle
said
his
was
a
real
story
the
ghost
of
the
blue
chamber
my
uncle
story
i
do
want
to
make
you
fellows
nervous
began
my
uncle
in
a
peculiarly
impressive
not
to
say
tone
of
voice
and
if
you
would
rather
that
i
did
not
mention
it
i
wo
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
very
house
in
which
we
are
now
sitting
is
haunted
you
do
say
that
exclaimed
coombes
what
the
use
of
your
saying
i
do
say
it
when
i
have
just
said
it
retorted
my
uncle
somewhat
pettishly
you
do
talk
so
foolishly
i
tell
you
the
house
is
haunted
regularly
on
christmas
eve
the
blue
chamber
they
called
the
room
next
to
the
nursery
the
chamber
at
my
uncle
most
of
the
toilet
service
being
of
that
shade
is
haunted
by
the
ghost
of
a
sinful
man
a
man
who
once
killed
a
christmas
wait
with
a
lump
of
coal
how
did
he
do
it
asked
coombes
with
eager
anxiousness
was
it
difficult
i
do
not
know
how
he
did
it
replied
my
uncle
he
did
not
explain
the
process
the
wait
had
taken
up
a
position
just
inside
the
front
gate
and
was
singing
a
ballad
it
is
presumed
that
when
he
opened
his
mouth
for
b
flat
the
lump
of
coal
was
thrown
by
the
sinful
man
from
one
of
the
windows
and
that
it
went
down
the
wait
throat
and
choked
him
you
want
to
be
a
good
shot
but
it
is
certainly
worth
trying
murmured
coombes
thoughtfully
but
that
was
not
his
only
crime
alas
added
my
uncle
prior
to
that
he
had
killed
a
solo
no
is
that
really
a
fact
exclaimed
coombes
of
course
it
a
fact
answered
my
uncle
testily
at
all
events
as
much
a
fact
as
you
can
expect
to
get
in
a
case
of
this
sort
how
very
captious
you
are
this
evening
the
circumstantial
evidence
was
overwhelming
the
poor
fellow
the
had
been
in
the
neighbourhood
barely
a
month
old
bishop
who
kept
the
sand
boys
at
the
time
and
from
whom
i
had
the
story
said
he
had
never
known
a
more
and
energetic
solo
he
the
only
knew
two
tunes
but
bishop
said
that
the
man
could
not
have
played
with
more
vigour
or
for
more
hours
in
a
day
if
he
had
known
forty
the
two
tunes
he
did
play
were
annie
laurie
and
home
sweet
home
and
as
regarded
his
performance
of
the
former
melody
bishop
said
that
a
mere
child
could
have
told
what
it
was
meant
for
this
musician
this
poor
friendless
artist
used
to
come
regularly
and
play
in
this
street
just
opposite
for
two
hours
every
evening
one
evening
he
was
seen
evidently
in
response
to
an
invitation
going
into
this
very
house
but
was
never
seen
coming
out
of
it
did
the
townsfolk
try
offering
any
reward
for
his
recovery
asked
coombes
not
a
replied
my
uncle
another
summer
continued
my
uncle
a
german
band
visited
here
intending
so
they
announced
on
their
arrival
to
stay
till
the
autumn
on
the
second
day
from
their
arrival
the
whole
company
as
fine
and
healthy
a
body
of
men
as
one
could
wish
to
see
were
invited
to
dinner
by
this
sinful
man
and
after
spending
the
whole
of
the
next
hours
in
bed
left
the
town
a
broken
and
dyspeptic
crew
the
parish
doctor
who
had
attended
them
giving
it
as
his
opinion
that
it
was
doubtful
if
they
would
any
of
them
be
fit
to
play
an
air
again
you
you
do
know
the
recipe
do
you
asked
coombes
unfortunately
i
do
not
replied
my
uncle
but
the
chief
ingredient
was
said
to
have
been
railway
i
forget
the
man
other
crimes
my
uncle
went
on
i
used
to
know
them
all
at
one
time
but
my
memory
is
not
what
it
was
i
do
not
however
believe
i
am
doing
his
memory
an
injustice
in
believing
that
he
was
not
entirely
unconnected
with
the
death
and
subsequent
burial
of
a
gentleman
who
used
to
play
the
harp
with
his
toes
and
that
neither
was
he
altogether
unresponsible
for
the
lonely
grave
of
an
unknown
stranger
who
had
once
visited
the
neighbourhood
an
italian
peasant
lad
a
performer
upon
the
organ
every
christmas
eve
said
my
uncle
cleaving
with
low
impressive
tones
the
strange
awed
silence
that
like
a
shadow
seemed
to
have
slowly
stolen
into
and
settled
down
upon
the
room
the
ghost
of
this
sinful
man
haunts
the
blue
chamber
in
this
very
house
there
from
midnight
until
amid
wild
muffled
shrieks
and
groans
and
mocking
laughter
and
the
ghostly
sound
of
horrid
blows
it
does
fierce
phantom
fight
with
the
spirits
of
the
solo
player
and
the
murdered
wait
assisted
at
intervals
by
the
shades
of
the
german
band
while
the
ghost
of
the
strangled
harpist
plays
mad
ghostly
melodies
with
ghostly
toes
on
the
ghost
of
a
broken
harp
uncle
said
the
blue
chamber
was
comparatively
useless
as
a
on
christmas
eve
hark
said
uncle
raising
a
warning
hand
towards
the
ceiling
while
we
held
our
breath
and
listened
hark
i
believe
they
are
at
it
now
in
the
blue
chamber
the
blue
chamber
i
rose
up
and
said
that
i
would
sleep
in
the
blue
chamber
before
i
tell
you
my
own
story
however
the
story
of
what
happened
in
the
blue
chamber
i
would
wish
to
preface
it
with
a
personal
explanation
i
feel
a
good
deal
of
hesitation
about
telling
you
this
story
of
my
own
you
see
it
is
not
a
story
like
the
other
stories
that
i
have
been
telling
you
or
rather
that
teddy
biffles
coombes
and
my
uncle
have
been
telling
you
it
is
a
true
story
it
is
not
a
story
told
by
a
person
sitting
round
a
fire
on
christmas
eve
drinking
whisky
punch
it
is
a
record
of
events
that
actually
happened
indeed
it
is
not
a
at
all
in
the
commonly
accepted
meaning
of
the
word
it
is
a
report
it
is
i
feel
almost
out
of
place
in
a
book
of
this
kind
it
is
more
suitable
to
a
biography
or
an
english
history
there
is
another
thing
that
makes
it
difficult
for
me
to
tell
you
this
story
and
that
is
that
it
is
all
about
myself
in
telling
you
this
story
i
shall
have
to
keep
on
talking
about
myself
and
talking
about
ourselves
is
what
we
authors
have
a
strong
objection
to
doing
if
we
literary
men
of
the
new
school
have
one
praiseworthy
yearning
more
ever
present
to
our
minds
than
another
it
is
the
yearning
never
to
appear
in
the
slightest
degree
egotistical
i
myself
so
i
am
told
carry
this
coyness
this
shrinking
reticence
concerning
anything
connected
with
my
own
personality
almost
too
far
and
people
grumble
at
me
because
of
it
people
come
to
me
and
say
well
now
why
do
you
talk
about
yourself
a
bit
that
what
we
want
to
read
about
tell
us
something
about
yourself
but
i
have
always
replied
no
it
is
not
that
i
do
not
think
the
subject
an
interesting
one
i
can
not
myself
conceive
of
any
topic
more
likely
to
prove
fascinating
to
the
world
as
a
whole
or
at
all
events
to
the
cultured
portion
of
it
but
i
will
not
do
it
on
principle
it
is
inartistic
and
it
sets
a
bad
example
to
the
younger
men
other
writers
a
few
of
them
do
it
i
know
but
i
will
not
not
as
a
rule
under
ordinary
circumstances
therefore
i
should
not
tell
you
this
story
at
all
i
should
say
to
myself
no
it
is
a
good
story
it
is
a
moral
story
it
is
a
strange
weird
enthralling
sort
of
a
story
and
the
public
i
know
would
like
to
hear
it
and
i
should
like
to
tell
it
to
them
but
it
is
all
about
myself
about
what
i
said
and
what
i
saw
and
what
i
did
and
i
can
not
do
it
my
retiring
nature
will
not
permit
me
to
talk
in
this
way
about
myself
but
the
circumstances
surrounding
this
story
are
not
ordinary
and
there
are
reasons
prompting
me
in
spite
of
my
modesty
to
rather
welcome
the
opportunity
of
relating
it
as
i
stated
at
the
beginning
there
has
been
unpleasantness
in
our
family
over
this
party
of
ours
and
as
regards
myself
in
particular
and
my
share
in
the
events
i
am
now
about
to
set
forth
gross
injustice
has
been
done
me
as
a
means
of
replacing
my
character
in
its
proper
light
of
dispelling
the
clouds
of
calumny
and
misconception
with
which
it
has
been
darkened
i
feel
that
my
best
course
is
to
give
a
simple
dignified
narration
of
the
plain
facts
and
allow
the
unprejudiced
to
judge
for
themselves
my
chief
object
i
candidly
confess
is
to
clear
myself
from
unjust
aspersion
spurred
by
this
motive
and
i
think
it
is
an
honourable
and
a
right
motive
i
find
i
am
enabled
to
overcome
my
usual
repugnance
to
talking
about
myself
and
can
thus
tell
my
own
story
as
soon
as
my
uncle
had
finished
his
story
i
as
i
have
already
told
you
rose
up
and
said
that
would
sleep
in
the
blue
chamber
that
very
night
never
cried
my
uncle
springing
up
you
shall
not
put
yourself
in
this
deadly
peril
besides
the
bed
is
not
made
never
mind
the
bed
i
replied
i
have
lived
in
furnished
apartments
for
gentlemen
and
have
been
accustomed
to
sleep
on
beds
that
have
never
been
made
from
one
year
end
to
the
other
do
not
thwart
me
in
my
resolve
i
am
young
and
have
had
a
clear
conscience
now
for
over
a
month
the
spirits
will
not
harm
me
i
may
even
do
them
some
little
good
and
induce
them
to
be
quiet
and
go
away
besides
i
should
like
to
see
the
show
saying
which
i
sat
down
again
how
coombes
came
to
be
in
my
chair
instead
of
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
where
he
had
been
all
the
evening
and
why
he
never
offered
to
apologise
when
i
sat
right
down
on
top
of
him
and
why
young
biffles
should
have
tried
to
palm
himself
off
upon
me
as
my
uncle
john
and
induced
me
under
that
erroneous
impression
to
shake
him
by
the
hand
for
nearly
three
minutes
and
tell
him
that
i
had
always
regarded
him
as
father
are
matters
that
to
this
day
i
have
never
been
able
to
fully
understand
they
tried
to
dissuade
me
from
what
they
termed
my
foolhardy
enterprise
but
i
remained
firm
and
claimed
my
privilege
i
was
guest
guest
always
sleeps
in
the
haunted
chamber
on
christmas
eve
it
is
his
perquisite
they
said
that
if
i
put
it
on
that
footing
they
had
of
course
no
answer
and
they
lighted
a
candle
for
me
and
accompanied
me
upstairs
in
a
body
whether
elevated
by
the
feeling
that
i
was
doing
a
noble
action
or
animated
by
a
mere
general
consciousness
of
rectitude
is
not
for
me
to
say
but
i
went
upstairs
that
night
with
remarkable
buoyancy
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
stop
at
the
landing
when
i
came
to
it
i
felt
i
wanted
to
go
on
up
to
the
roof
but
with
the
help
of
the
banisters
i
restrained
my
ambition
wished
them
all
night
and
went
in
and
shut
the
door
things
began
to
go
wrong
with
me
from
the
very
first
the
candle
tumbled
out
of
the
candlestick
before
my
hand
was
off
the
lock
it
kept
on
tumbling
out
of
the
candlestick
and
every
time
i
picked
put
it
up
and
put
it
in
it
tumbled
out
again
i
never
saw
such
a
slippery
candle
i
gave
up
attempting
to
use
the
candlestick
at
last
and
carried
the
candle
about
in
my
hand
and
even
then
it
would
not
keep
upright
so
i
got
wild
and
threw
it
out
of
window
and
undressed
and
went
to
bed
in
the
dark
i
did
not
go
to
sleep
i
did
not
feel
sleepy
at
all
i
lay
on
my
back
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
and
thinking
of
things
i
wish
i
could
remember
some
of
the
ideas
that
came
to
me
as
i
lay
there
because
they
were
so
amusing
i
laughed
at
them
myself
till
the
bed
shook
i
had
been
lying
like
this
for
half
an
hour
or
so
and
had
forgotten
all
about
the
ghost
when
on
casually
casting
my
eyes
round
the
room
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
a
singularly
phantom
sitting
in
the
by
the
fire
smoking
the
ghost
of
a
long
clay
pipe
i
fancied
for
the
moment
as
most
people
would
under
similar
circumstances
that
i
must
be
dreaming
i
sat
up
and
rubbed
my
eyes
no
it
was
a
ghost
clear
enough
i
could
see
the
back
of
the
chair
through
his
body
he
looked
over
towards
me
took
the
shadowy
pipe
from
his
lips
and
nodded
the
most
surprising
part
of
the
whole
thing
to
me
was
that
i
did
not
feel
in
the
least
alarmed
if
anything
i
was
rather
pleased
to
see
him
it
was
company
i
said
good
evening
it
been
a
cold
day
he
said
he
had
not
noticed
it
himself
but
dared
say
i
was
right
we
remained
silent
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
wishing
to
put
it
pleasantly
i
said
i
believe
i
have
the
honour
of
addressing
the
ghost
of
the
gentleman
who
had
the
accident
with
the
wait
he
smiled
and
said
it
was
very
good
of
me
to
remember
it
one
wait
was
not
much
to
boast
of
but
still
every
little
helped
i
was
somewhat
staggered
at
his
answer
i
had
expected
a
groan
of
remorse
the
ghost
appeared
on
the
contrary
to
be
rather
conceited
over
the
business
i
thought
that
as
he
had
taken
my
reference
to
the
wait
so
quietly
perhaps
he
would
not
be
offended
if
i
questioned
him
about
the
i
felt
curious
about
that
poor
boy
is
it
true
i
asked
that
you
had
a
hand
in
the
death
of
that
italian
peasant
lad
who
came
to
the
town
once
with
a
that
played
nothing
but
scotch
airs
he
quite
fired
up
had
a
hand
in
it
he
exclaimed
indignantly
who
has
dared
to
pretend
that
he
assisted
me
i
murdered
the
youth
myself
nobody
helped
me
alone
i
did
it
show
me
the
man
who
says
i
did
i
calmed
him
i
assured
him
that
i
had
never
in
my
own
mind
doubted
that
he
was
the
real
and
only
assassin
and
i
went
on
and
asked
him
what
he
had
done
with
the
body
of
the
he
had
killed
he
said
to
which
one
may
you
be
alluding
oh
were
there
any
more
then
i
inquired
he
smiled
and
gave
a
little
cough
he
said
he
did
not
like
to
appear
to
be
boasting
but
that
counting
trombones
there
were
seven
dear
me
i
replied
you
must
have
had
quite
a
busy
time
of
it
one
way
and
another
he
said
that
perhaps
he
ought
not
to
be
the
one
to
say
so
but
that
really
speaking
of
ordinary
he
thought
there
were
few
ghosts
who
could
look
back
upon
a
life
of
more
sustained
usefulness
he
puffed
away
in
silence
for
a
few
seconds
while
i
sat
watching
him
i
had
never
seen
a
ghost
smoking
a
pipe
before
that
i
could
remember
and
it
interested
me
i
asked
him
what
tobacco
he
used
and
he
replied
the
ghost
of
cut
cavendish
as
a
rule
he
explained
that
the
ghost
of
all
the
tobacco
that
a
man
smoked
in
life
belonged
to
him
when
he
became
dead
he
said
he
himself
had
smoked
a
good
deal
of
cut
cavendish
when
he
was
alive
so
that
he
was
well
supplied
with
the
ghost
of
it
now
i
observed
that
it
was
a
useful
thing
to
know
that
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
smoke
as
much
tobacco
as
ever
i
could
before
i
died
i
thought
i
might
as
well
start
at
once
so
i
said
i
would
join
him
in
a
pipe
and
he
said
do
old
man
and
i
reached
over
and
got
out
the
necessary
paraphernalia
from
my
coat
pocket
and
lit
up
we
grew
quite
chummy
after
that
and
he
told
me
all
his
crimes
he
said
he
had
lived
next
door
once
to
a
young
lady
who
was
learning
to
play
the
guitar
while
a
gentleman
who
practised
on
the
viol
lived
opposite
and
he
with
fiendish
cunning
had
introduced
these
two
unsuspecting
young
people
to
one
another
and
had
persuaded
them
to
elope
with
each
other
against
their
wishes
and
take
their
musical
instruments
with
them
and
they
had
done
so
and
before
the
honeymoon
was
over
she
had
broken
his
head
with
the
and
he
had
tried
to
cram
the
guitar
down
her
throat
and
had
injured
her
for
life
my
friend
said
he
used
to
lure
into
the
passage
and
then
stuff
them
with
their
own
wares
till
they
burst
and
died
he
said
he
had
quieted
eighteen
that
way
young
men
and
women
who
recited
long
and
dreary
poems
at
evening
parties
and
callow
youths
who
walked
about
the
streets
late
at
night
playing
concertinas
he
used
to
get
together
and
poison
in
batches
of
ten
so
as
to
save
expense
and
park
orators
and
temperance
lecturers
he
used
to
shut
up
six
in
a
small
room
with
a
glass
of
water
and
a
apiece
and
let
them
talk
each
other
to
death
it
did
one
good
to
listen
to
him
i
asked
him
when
he
expected
the
other
ghosts
the
ghosts
of
the
wait
and
the
and
the
german
band
that
uncle
john
had
mentioned
he
smiled
and
said
they
would
never
come
again
any
of
them
i
said
why
is
it
true
then
that
they
meet
you
here
every
christmas
eve
for
a
row
he
replied
that
it
was
true
every
christmas
eve
for
years
had
he
and
they
fought
in
that
room
but
they
would
never
trouble
him
nor
anybody
else
again
one
by
one
had
he
laid
them
out
spoilt
and
utterly
useless
for
all
haunting
purposes
he
had
finished
off
the
last
ghost
that
very
evening
just
before
i
came
upstairs
and
had
thrown
what
was
left
of
it
out
through
the
slit
between
the
he
said
it
would
never
be
worth
calling
a
ghost
again
i
suppose
you
will
still
come
yourself
as
usual
i
said
they
would
be
sorry
to
miss
you
i
know
oh
i
do
know
he
replied
there
nothing
much
to
come
for
now
unless
he
added
kindly
you
are
going
to
be
here
come
if
you
will
sleep
here
next
christmas
eve
i
have
taken
a
liking
to
you
he
continued
you
do
fly
off
screeching
when
you
see
a
party
and
your
hair
does
stand
on
end
you
no
idea
he
said
how
sick
i
am
of
seeing
hair
standing
on
end
he
said
it
irritated
him
just
then
a
slight
noise
reached
us
from
the
yard
below
and
he
started
and
turned
deathly
black
you
are
ill
i
cried
springing
towards
him
tell
me
the
best
thing
to
do
for
you
shall
i
drink
some
brandy
and
give
you
the
ghost
of
it
he
remained
silent
listening
intently
for
a
moment
and
then
he
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
the
shade
came
back
to
his
cheek
it
all
right
he
murmured
i
was
afraid
it
was
the
cock
oh
it
too
early
for
that
i
said
why
it
only
the
middle
of
the
night
oh
that
does
make
any
difference
to
those
cursed
chickens
he
replied
bitterly
they
would
just
as
soon
crow
in
the
middle
of
the
night
as
at
any
other
time
sooner
if
they
thought
it
would
spoil
a
chap
evening
out
i
believe
they
do
it
on
purpose
he
said
a
friend
of
his
the
ghost
of
a
man
who
had
killed
a
rate
collector
used
to
haunt
a
house
in
long
acre
where
they
kept
fowls
in
the
cellar
and
every
time
a
policeman
went
by
and
flashed
his
down
the
grating
the
old
cock
there
would
fancy
it
was
the
sun
and
start
crowing
like
mad
when
of
course
the
poor
ghost
had
to
dissolve
and
it
would
in
consequence
get
back
home
sometimes
as
early
as
one
in
the
morning
swearing
fearfully
because
it
had
only
been
out
for
an
hour
i
agreed
that
it
seemed
very
unfair
oh
it
an
absurd
arrangement
altogether
he
continued
quite
angrily
i
ca
imagine
what
our
old
man
could
have
been
thinking
of
when
he
made
it
as
i
have
said
to
him
over
and
over
again
a
fixed
time
and
let
everybody
stick
to
it
say
four
in
summer
and
six
in
winter
then
one
would
know
what
one
was
about
how
do
you
manage
when
there
is
any
cock
handy
i
inquired
he
was
on
the
point
of
replying
when
again
he
started
and
listened
this
time
i
distinctly
heard
bowles
cock
next
door
crow
twice
there
you
are
he
said
rising
and
reaching
for
his
hat
the
sort
of
thing
we
have
to
put
up
with
what
is
the
time
i
looked
at
my
watch
and
found
it
was
three
i
thought
as
much
he
muttered
i
wring
that
blessed
neck
if
i
get
hold
of
it
and
he
prepared
to
go
if
you
can
wait
half
a
minute
i
said
getting
out
of
bed
go
a
bit
of
the
way
with
you
it
very
good
of
you
he
rejoined
pausing
but
it
seems
unkind
to
drag
you
out
not
at
all
i
replied
i
shall
like
a
walk
and
i
partially
dressed
myself
and
took
my
umbrella
and
he
put
his
arm
through
mine
and
we
went
out
together
just
by
the
gate
we
met
jones
one
of
the
local
constables
jones
i
said
i
always
feel
affable
at
time
sir
answered
the
man
a
little
gruffly
i
thought
may
i
ask
what
you
of
oh
it
all
right
i
responded
with
a
wave
of
my
umbrella
just
seeing
my
friend
part
of
the
way
home
he
said
what
friend
oh
ah
of
course
i
laughed
i
forgot
he
invisible
to
you
he
is
the
ghost
of
the
gentleman
that
killed
the
wait
i
just
going
to
the
corner
with
him
ah
i
do
think
i
would
if
i
was
you
sir
said
jones
severely
if
you
take
my
advice
you
say
to
your
friend
here
and
go
back
indoors
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
that
you
are
walking
about
with
nothing
on
but
a
and
a
pair
of
boots
and
an
where
your
trousers
i
did
not
like
the
man
manner
at
all
i
said
jones
i
wish
to
have
to
report
you
but
it
seems
to
me
you
been
drinking
my
trousers
are
where
a
man
trousers
ought
to
be
on
his
legs
i
distinctly
remember
putting
them
on
well
you
have
got
them
on
now
he
retorted
i
beg
your
pardon
i
replied
i
tell
you
i
have
i
think
i
ought
to
know
i
think
so
too
he
answered
but
you
evidently
do
now
you
come
along
indoors
with
me
and
do
let
have
any
more
of
it
uncle
john
came
to
the
door
at
this
point
having
been
awaked
i
suppose
by
the
altercation
and
at
the
same
moment
aunt
maria
appeared
at
the
window
in
her
nightcap
i
explained
the
constable
mistake
to
them
treating
the
matter
as
lightly
as
i
could
so
as
not
to
get
the
man
into
trouble
and
i
turned
for
confirmation
to
the
ghost
he
was
gone
he
had
left
me
without
a
word
without
even
saying
it
struck
me
as
so
unkind
his
having
gone
off
in
that
way
that
i
burst
into
tears
and
uncle
john
came
out
and
led
me
back
into
the
house
on
reaching
my
room
i
discovered
that
jones
was
right
i
had
not
put
on
my
trousers
after
all
they
were
still
hanging
over
the
i
suppose
in
my
anxiety
not
to
keep
the
ghost
waiting
i
must
have
forgotten
them
such
are
the
plain
facts
of
the
case
out
of
which
it
must
doubtless
to
the
healthy
charitable
mind
appear
impossible
that
calumny
could
spring
but
it
has
persons
i
say
have
professed
themselves
unable
to
understand
the
simple
circumstances
herein
narrated
except
in
the
light
of
explanations
at
once
misleading
and
insulting
slurs
have
been
cast
and
aspersions
made
on
me
by
those
of
my
own
flesh
and
blood
but
i
bear
no
i
merely
as
i
have
said
set
forth
this
statement
for
the
purpose
of
clearing
my
character
from
injurious
suspicion
