a
mummer
tale
chapter
i
the
scene
was
an
actress
at
the
odéon
félicie
nanteuil
her
hair
powdered
with
blue
on
her
eyelids
rouge
on
her
cheeks
and
ears
and
white
on
her
neck
and
shoulders
was
holding
out
her
foot
to
madame
michon
the
dresser
who
was
fitting
on
a
pair
of
little
black
slippers
with
red
heels
trublet
the
physician
attached
to
the
theatre
and
a
friend
of
the
actress
was
resting
his
bald
cranium
on
a
cushion
of
the
divan
his
hands
folded
upon
his
stomach
and
his
short
legs
crossed
what
else
my
dear
he
inquired
of
her
oh
i
do
know
fits
of
suffocation
giddiness
and
all
of
a
sudden
an
agonizing
pain
as
if
i
were
going
to
die
that
the
worst
of
all
do
you
sometimes
feel
as
though
you
must
laugh
or
cry
for
no
apparent
reason
about
nothing
at
all
that
i
can
not
tell
you
for
in
this
life
one
has
so
many
reasons
for
laughing
or
crying
are
you
subject
to
attacks
of
dizziness
no
but
just
think
doctor
at
night
i
see
an
imaginary
cat
under
the
chairs
or
the
table
gazing
at
me
with
fiery
eyes
try
not
to
dream
of
cats
any
more
said
madame
michon
because
a
bad
omen
to
see
a
cat
is
a
sign
that
you
be
betrayed
by
friends
or
deceived
by
a
woman
but
it
is
not
in
my
dreams
that
i
see
a
cat
it
when
i
wide
awake
trublet
who
was
in
attendance
at
the
odéon
once
a
month
only
was
given
to
looking
in
as
a
friend
almost
every
evening
he
was
fond
of
the
actresses
delighted
in
chatting
with
them
gave
them
good
advice
and
listened
with
delicacy
to
their
confidences
he
promised
félicie
that
he
would
write
her
a
prescription
at
once
we
attend
to
the
stomach
my
dear
child
and
you
see
no
more
cats
under
the
chairs
and
tables
madame
michon
was
adjusting
the
actress
stays
the
doctor
suddenly
gloomy
watched
her
tugging
at
the
laces
do
scowl
said
félicie
i
am
never
with
my
waist
i
should
surely
be
a
fool
if
i
were
and
she
added
thinking
of
her
best
friend
in
the
theatre
it
all
very
well
for
fagette
who
has
no
shoulders
and
no
hips
she
simply
straight
up
and
down
michon
you
can
pull
a
little
tighter
still
i
know
you
are
no
lover
of
waists
doctor
nevertheless
i
can
not
wear
swaddling
bands
like
those
æsthetic
creatures
just
slip
your
hand
into
my
stays
and
you
see
that
i
do
squeeze
myself
too
tight
he
denied
that
he
was
inimical
to
stays
he
only
condemned
them
when
too
tightly
laced
he
deplored
the
fact
that
women
should
have
no
sense
of
the
harmony
of
line
that
they
should
associate
with
smallness
of
the
waist
an
idea
of
grace
and
beauty
not
realizing
that
their
beauty
resided
wholly
in
those
modulations
through
which
the
body
having
displayed
the
superb
expansion
of
chest
and
bosom
tapers
off
gradually
below
the
thorax
to
glorify
itself
in
the
calm
and
generous
width
of
the
flanks
the
waist
he
said
the
waist
since
one
has
to
make
use
of
that
hideous
word
should
be
a
gradual
imperceptible
gentle
transition
from
one
to
another
of
woman
two
glories
her
bosom
and
her
womb
and
you
stupidly
strangle
it
you
stave
in
the
thorax
which
involves
the
breasts
in
its
ruin
you
flatten
your
lower
ribs
and
you
plough
a
horrible
furrow
above
the
navel
the
negresses
who
file
their
teeth
down
to
a
point
and
split
their
lips
in
order
to
insert
a
wooden
disc
disfigure
themselves
in
a
less
barbarous
fashion
for
after
all
some
feminine
splendour
still
remains
to
a
creature
who
wears
rings
in
the
cartilage
of
her
nose
and
whose
lip
is
distended
by
a
circular
disc
of
mahogany
as
big
as
this
pomade
pot
but
the
devastation
is
complete
when
woman
carries
her
ravages
into
the
sacred
centre
of
her
empire
dwelling
upon
a
favourite
subject
he
enumerated
one
by
one
the
deformities
of
the
bones
and
muscles
caused
by
the
wearing
of
stays
in
terms
now
fanciful
now
precise
now
droll
now
lugubrious
nanteuil
laughed
as
she
listened
she
laughed
because
being
a
woman
she
felt
an
inclination
to
laugh
at
physical
uncomeliness
or
poverty
because
referring
everything
to
her
own
little
world
of
actors
and
actresses
each
and
every
deformity
described
by
the
doctor
reminded
her
of
some
comrade
of
the
boards
stamping
itself
on
her
mind
like
a
caricature
knowing
that
she
herself
had
a
good
figure
she
delighted
in
her
own
young
body
as
she
pictured
to
herself
all
these
indignities
of
the
flesh
with
a
ringing
laugh
she
crossed
the
towards
the
doctor
dragging
with
her
madame
michon
who
was
holding
on
to
her
as
though
they
were
reins
with
the
look
of
a
sorceress
being
whisked
away
to
a
witches
sabbath
do
be
afraid
she
said
and
she
objected
that
peasant
women
who
never
wore
stays
had
far
worse
figures
than
women
the
doctor
bitterly
inveighed
against
the
western
civilizations
because
of
their
contempt
for
and
ignorance
of
natural
beauty
trublet
born
within
the
shadow
of
had
gone
as
a
young
man
to
practise
in
cairo
he
brought
back
from
that
city
a
little
money
a
liver
complaint
and
a
knowledge
of
the
various
customs
of
humanity
when
at
a
ripe
age
he
returned
to
his
own
country
he
rarely
strayed
from
his
ancient
rue
de
seine
thoroughly
enjoying
his
life
save
that
it
depressed
him
a
trifle
to
see
how
little
able
his
contemporaries
were
to
realize
the
deplorable
misunderstandings
which
for
eighteen
centuries
had
kept
humanity
at
with
nature
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
it
only
me
exclaimed
a
woman
voice
in
the
passage
félicie
slipping
on
her
pink
petticoat
begged
the
doctor
to
open
the
door
enter
madame
doulce
a
lady
who
was
allowing
her
massive
person
to
run
to
seed
although
she
had
long
contrived
to
hold
it
together
on
the
boards
compelling
it
to
assume
the
dignity
proper
to
aristocratic
mothers
well
my
dear
d
doctor
félicie
you
know
i
am
not
one
to
pay
compliments
nevertheless
i
saw
you
the
day
before
yesterday
and
i
assure
you
that
in
the
second
of
mère
you
put
in
some
excellent
touches
which
are
far
from
easy
to
bring
off
nanteuil
with
smiling
eyes
waited
as
is
always
the
case
when
one
has
received
a
compliment
for
another
madame
doulce
thus
invited
by
nanteuil
silence
murmured
some
additional
words
of
praise
excellent
touches
genuinely
individual
business
you
really
think
so
madame
doulce
glad
to
hear
it
for
i
do
feel
the
part
and
then
that
great
perrin
woman
upsets
me
altogether
it
is
a
fact
when
i
sit
on
the
creature
knees
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
you
do
know
all
the
horrors
that
she
whispers
into
my
ear
while
we
are
on
the
stage
she
crazy
i
understand
everything
but
there
are
some
things
which
disgust
me
michon
do
my
stays
crease
at
the
back
on
the
right
my
dear
child
cried
trublet
with
enthusiasm
you
have
just
said
something
that
is
really
admirable
what
inquired
nanteuil
simply
you
said
understand
everything
but
there
are
some
things
which
disgust
me
you
understand
everything
the
thoughts
and
actions
of
men
appear
to
you
as
particular
instances
of
the
universal
mechanics
but
in
respect
of
them
you
cherish
neither
hatred
nor
anger
but
there
are
things
which
disgust
you
you
have
a
fastidious
taste
and
it
is
profoundly
true
that
morals
are
a
matter
of
taste
my
child
i
could
wish
that
the
academy
of
moral
science
thought
as
sanely
as
you
yes
you
are
quite
right
as
regards
the
instincts
which
you
attribute
to
your
it
is
as
futile
to
blame
her
for
them
as
to
blame
lactic
acid
for
being
an
acid
possessing
mixed
properties
what
are
you
talking
about
i
am
saying
that
we
can
no
longer
assign
praise
or
blame
to
any
human
thought
or
action
once
the
inevitable
nature
of
such
thoughts
and
actions
has
been
proved
for
us
so
you
approve
of
the
morals
of
that
gawk
of
a
perrin
do
you
you
a
member
of
the
legion
of
honour
a
nice
thing
to
be
sure
the
doctor
heaved
himself
up
my
child
he
said
give
me
a
moment
attention
i
am
going
to
tell
you
an
instructive
story
in
times
gone
by
human
nature
was
other
than
it
is
there
were
then
not
men
and
women
only
but
also
hermaphrodites
in
other
words
beings
in
whom
the
two
sexes
were
combined
these
three
kinds
of
human
beings
possessed
four
arms
four
legs
and
two
faces
they
were
robust
and
rotated
rapidly
on
their
own
axes
just
like
wheels
their
strength
inspired
them
with
audacity
to
war
with
the
gods
therein
following
the
example
of
the
giants
jupiter
unable
to
brook
such
insolence
michon
does
my
petticoat
hang
too
low
on
the
left
asked
nanteuil
resolved
continued
the
doctor
to
render
them
less
strong
and
less
daring
he
divided
each
into
two
so
that
they
had
now
but
two
arms
two
legs
and
one
head
apiece
and
thenceforward
the
human
race
became
what
it
is
consequently
each
of
us
is
only
the
half
of
a
human
being
divided
from
the
other
half
just
as
one
divides
a
sole
into
two
portions
these
halves
are
ever
seeking
their
other
halves
the
love
which
we
experience
for
one
another
is
nothing
but
an
invisible
force
impelling
us
to
reunite
our
two
halves
in
order
to
ourselves
in
our
pristine
perfection
those
men
who
result
from
the
divisions
of
hermaphrodites
love
women
those
women
who
have
a
similar
origin
love
men
but
the
women
who
proceed
from
the
division
of
primitive
women
do
not
bestow
much
attention
upon
men
but
are
drawn
toward
their
own
sex
so
do
not
be
astonished
when
you
see
did
you
invent
that
precious
story
doctor
inquired
nanteuil
pinning
a
rose
in
her
bodice
the
doctor
protested
that
he
had
not
invented
a
word
of
it
on
the
contrary
he
had
he
said
left
out
part
of
the
story
so
much
the
better
exclaimed
nanteuil
for
i
must
tell
you
that
the
person
who
did
invent
it
is
not
particularly
brilliant
he
is
dead
remarked
trublet
nanteuil
once
more
expressed
her
disgust
of
her
but
madame
doulce
who
was
prudent
and
occasionally
took
with
jeanne
perrin
changed
the
subject
well
my
darling
so
you
got
the
part
of
angélique
only
remember
what
i
told
you
your
gestures
should
be
somewhat
restrained
and
you
yourself
a
little
stiff
that
is
the
secret
of
the
beware
of
your
charming
natural
suppleness
young
girls
in
a
piece
ought
to
be
just
a
trifle
it
good
form
the
costume
requires
it
you
see
félicie
what
you
must
do
above
all
when
you
are
playing
in
mère
which
is
a
delightful
play
oh
interrupted
félicie
so
long
as
i
have
a
good
part
i
do
care
a
fig
for
the
play
besides
i
am
not
particularly
in
love
with
marivaux
what
are
you
laughing
at
doctor
have
i
put
my
foot
in
it
is
mère
by
marivaux
to
be
sure
it
is
well
then
you
are
always
trying
to
muddle
me
i
was
saying
that
angélique
gets
on
my
nerves
i
should
prefer
a
part
with
more
meat
in
it
something
out
of
the
ordinary
this
evenings
especially
the
part
gives
me
the
creeps
all
the
more
likely
that
you
do
well
in
it
my
pet
said
madame
doulce
we
never
enter
more
thoroughly
into
our
parts
than
when
we
do
so
by
main
force
and
in
spite
of
ourselves
i
could
give
you
many
examples
i
myself
in
vivandière
staggered
the
house
by
my
gaiety
of
tone
when
i
had
just
been
informed
that
my
doulce
so
great
an
artist
and
so
good
a
husband
had
had
an
epileptic
fit
in
the
orchestra
at
the
odéon
just
as
he
was
picking
up
his
cornet
why
do
they
insist
on
my
being
nothing
but
an
inquired
nanteuil
who
wanted
to
play
the
woman
in
love
the
brilliant
coquette
and
every
part
a
woman
could
play
that
is
quite
natural
persisted
madame
doulce
comedy
is
an
imitative
art
and
you
imitate
an
art
all
the
better
for
not
feeling
it
yourself
do
not
delude
yourself
my
child
said
the
doctor
to
félicie
once
an
always
an
you
are
born
an
angélique
or
a
dorine
a
célimène
or
a
madame
pernelle
on
the
stage
some
women
are
always
twenty
others
are
always
thirty
others
again
are
always
sixty
as
for
you
mademoiselle
nanteuil
you
will
always
be
eighteen
and
you
will
always
be
an
i
am
quite
content
with
my
work
replied
nanteuil
but
you
can
not
expect
me
to
play
all
with
the
same
pleasure
there
is
one
part
for
example
which
i
long
to
play
and
that
is
agnès
in
des
at
the
mere
mention
of
the
name
of
agnès
the
doctor
murmured
delightedly
from
among
his
cushions
mes
yeux
du
mal
pour
en
donner
au
monde
agnès
that
a
part
if
you
like
exclaimed
nanteuil
i
have
asked
pradel
to
give
it
me
pradel
the
manager
of
the
theatre
was
an
a
wideawake
genial
fellow
who
had
got
rid
of
his
illusions
and
nourished
no
exaggerated
hopes
he
loved
peace
books
and
women
nanteuil
had
every
reason
to
speak
well
of
pradel
and
she
referred
to
him
without
any
feeling
of
ill
will
and
with
frank
directness
it
was
shameful
disgusting
rotten
of
him
she
said
he
would
let
me
play
agnès
and
gave
the
part
to
falempin
i
must
say
though
that
when
i
asked
him
i
did
go
the
right
way
about
it
while
she
knows
how
to
tackle
him
if
you
like
but
what
do
i
care
if
pradel
does
let
me
play
agnès
he
can
go
to
the
deuce
and
his
dirty
punch
and
judy
show
too
madame
doulce
continued
to
lavish
her
unheeded
precepts
she
was
an
actress
of
merits
but
she
was
old
and
worn
out
and
no
longer
obtained
any
engagements
she
gave
advice
to
beginners
wrote
their
letters
for
them
and
thus
in
the
morning
or
evenings
earned
what
was
almost
every
day
her
only
meal
doctor
asked
félicie
while
madame
michon
was
fastening
a
black
velvet
ribbon
round
her
neck
you
say
that
my
fits
of
dizziness
are
due
to
my
stomach
are
you
sure
of
that
before
trublet
could
answer
madame
doulce
exclaimed
that
fits
of
dizziness
always
proceeded
from
the
stomach
and
that
two
or
three
hours
after
meals
she
experienced
a
feeling
of
distension
in
hers
and
she
thereupon
asked
the
doctor
for
a
remedy
félicie
however
was
thinking
for
she
was
capable
of
thought
doctor
she
said
suddenly
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
which
you
may
possibly
think
a
droll
one
but
i
do
really
want
to
know
whether
considering
that
you
know
just
what
there
is
in
the
human
body
and
that
you
have
seen
all
the
things
we
have
inside
us
it
does
embarrass
you
at
certain
moments
in
your
dealings
with
women
it
seems
to
me
that
the
idea
of
all
that
must
disgust
you
from
the
depths
of
his
cushions
trublet
wafting
a
kiss
to
félicie
replied
my
dear
child
there
is
no
more
exquisitely
delicate
rich
and
beautiful
tissue
than
the
skin
of
a
pretty
woman
that
is
what
i
was
telling
myself
just
now
while
contemplating
the
back
of
your
neck
and
you
will
readily
understand
that
under
such
an
impression
she
made
a
grimace
at
him
like
that
of
a
disdainful
monkey
you
think
it
witty
i
suppose
to
talk
nonsense
when
anyone
asks
you
a
serious
question
well
then
since
you
wish
it
mademoiselle
you
shall
have
an
instructive
answer
some
twenty
years
ago
we
had
in
the
room
at
the
hôpital
a
drunken
old
watchman
named
daddy
rousseau
who
every
day
at
eleven
used
to
lunch
at
the
end
of
the
table
on
which
the
corpse
was
lying
he
ate
his
lunch
because
he
was
hungry
nothing
prevents
people
who
are
hungry
from
eating
as
soon
as
they
have
got
something
to
eat
only
daddy
rousseau
used
to
say
do
know
whether
it
is
because
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
but
i
must
have
something
fresh
and
appetizing
i
understand
said
félicie
little
are
what
you
want
but
you
must
you
know
and
there
you
are
seated
like
a
turk
and
you
have
written
out
my
prescription
yet
she
cast
an
inquiring
glance
at
him
where
is
the
stomach
exactly
the
door
had
remained
ajar
a
young
man
a
very
pretty
fellow
and
extremely
fashionable
pushed
it
open
and
having
taken
a
couple
of
steps
into
the
inquired
politely
whether
he
might
come
in
oh
it
you
said
nanteuil
and
she
stretched
out
her
hand
which
he
kissed
with
pleasure
ceremony
and
fatuity
how
are
you
doctor
socrates
he
inquired
without
wasting
any
particular
courtesies
on
madame
doulce
trublet
was
often
accosted
in
this
manner
because
of
his
and
his
subtle
speech
pointing
to
nanteuil
he
said
monsieur
de
ligny
you
see
before
you
a
young
lady
who
is
not
quite
sure
whether
she
has
a
stomach
it
is
a
serious
question
we
advise
her
to
refer
for
the
answer
to
the
little
girl
who
ate
too
much
jam
her
mother
said
to
her
will
injure
your
stomach
the
child
replied
only
ladies
who
have
stomachs
little
girls
have
any
heavens
how
silly
you
are
doctor
cried
nanteuil
i
would
you
spoke
the
truth
mademoiselle
silliness
is
the
capacity
for
happiness
it
is
the
sovereign
content
it
is
the
prime
asset
in
a
civilized
society
you
are
paradoxical
my
dear
doctor
remarked
monsieur
de
ligny
but
i
grant
you
that
it
is
better
to
be
silly
as
everybody
is
silly
than
to
be
clever
as
no
one
else
is
clever
it
true
what
robert
says
exclaimed
nanteuil
sincerely
impressed
and
she
added
thoughtfully
at
any
rate
doctor
one
thing
is
certain
it
is
that
stupidity
often
prevents
one
from
doing
stupid
things
i
have
noticed
that
many
a
time
whether
you
take
men
or
women
those
are
not
the
most
stupid
who
act
the
most
stupidly
for
example
there
are
intelligent
women
who
are
stupid
about
men
you
mean
those
who
can
not
do
without
them
there
no
hiding
anything
from
you
my
little
socrates
ah
sighed
the
big
doulce
what
a
terrible
slavery
it
is
every
woman
who
can
not
control
her
senses
is
lost
to
art
nanteuil
shrugged
her
pretty
shoulders
which
still
retained
something
of
the
angularity
of
youth
oh
my
do
try
to
kid
the
youngsters
what
an
idea
in
your
days
did
actresses
control
their
how
did
you
put
it
fiddlesticks
they
did
control
them
a
scrap
noticing
that
nanteuil
temper
was
rising
the
bulky
doulce
retired
with
dignity
and
prudence
once
in
the
passage
she
vouchsafed
a
further
word
of
advice
remember
my
darling
to
play
angélique
as
a
the
part
requires
it
but
nanteuil
her
nerves
on
edge
took
no
notice
really
she
said
sitting
down
before
her
she
makes
me
boil
that
old
doulce
with
her
morality
does
she
think
people
have
forgotten
her
adventures
if
so
she
is
mistaken
madame
ravaud
tells
one
of
them
six
days
out
of
seven
everybody
knows
that
she
reduced
her
husband
the
musician
to
such
a
state
of
exhaustion
that
one
night
he
tumbled
into
his
cornet
as
for
her
lovers
magnificent
men
just
ask
madame
michon
why
in
less
than
two
years
she
made
mere
shadows
of
them
mere
puffs
of
breath
that
the
way
she
controlled
them
and
supposing
anyone
had
told
her
that
she
was
lost
to
art
trublet
extended
his
two
hands
palms
outward
towards
nanteuil
as
though
to
stop
her
do
not
excite
yourself
my
child
madame
doulce
is
sincere
she
used
to
love
men
now
she
loves
god
one
loves
what
one
can
as
one
can
and
with
what
one
has
she
has
become
chaste
and
pious
at
the
fitting
age
she
is
diligent
in
the
practices
of
her
religion
she
goes
to
mass
on
sundays
and
feast
days
she
well
she
is
right
to
go
to
mass
asserted
nanteuil
michon
light
a
candle
for
me
to
heat
my
rouge
i
must
do
my
lips
again
certainly
she
is
quite
right
to
go
to
mass
but
religion
does
not
forbid
one
to
have
a
lover
you
think
not
asked
the
doctor
i
know
my
religion
better
than
you
that
certain
a
lugubrious
bell
sounded
and
the
mournful
voice
of
the
was
heard
in
the
corridors
the
is
over
nanteuil
rose
and
slipped
over
her
wrist
a
velvet
ribbon
ornamented
with
a
steel
medallion
madame
michon
was
on
her
knees
arranging
the
three
watteau
pleats
of
the
pink
dress
and
with
her
mouth
full
of
pins
delivered
herself
from
one
corner
of
her
lips
of
the
following
maxim
there
is
one
good
thing
in
being
old
men
can
not
make
you
suffer
any
more
robert
de
ligny
took
a
cigarette
from
his
case
may
i
and
he
moved
toward
the
lighted
candle
on
the
nanteuil
who
never
took
her
eyes
off
him
saw
beneath
his
moustache
red
and
light
as
flame
his
lips
ruddy
in
the
candlelight
drawing
in
and
puffing
out
the
smoke
she
felt
a
slight
warmth
in
her
ears
pretending
to
look
among
her
trinkets
she
grazed
ligny
neck
with
her
lips
and
whispered
to
him
wait
for
me
after
the
show
in
a
cab
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
tournon
at
this
moment
the
sound
of
voices
and
footsteps
was
heard
in
the
corridor
the
actors
in
the
were
returning
to
their
doctor
pass
me
your
newspaper
it
is
highly
uninteresting
mademoiselle
never
mind
pass
it
over
she
took
it
and
held
it
like
a
screen
above
her
head
the
light
makes
my
eyes
ache
she
observed
it
was
true
that
a
too
brilliant
light
would
sometimes
give
her
a
headache
but
she
had
just
seen
herself
in
the
glass
with
her
eyelids
her
eyelashes
smeared
with
a
black
paste
her
cheeks
her
lips
tinted
red
in
the
shape
of
a
tiny
heart
it
seemed
to
her
she
looked
like
a
painted
corpse
with
glass
eyes
and
she
did
not
wish
ligny
to
see
her
thus
while
she
was
keeping
her
face
in
the
shadow
of
the
newspaper
a
tall
lean
young
man
entered
the
with
a
swaggering
gait
his
melancholy
eyes
were
deeply
sunken
above
a
nose
like
a
crow
beak
his
mouth
was
set
in
a
petrified
grin
the
adam
apple
of
his
long
throat
made
a
deep
shadow
on
his
stock
he
was
dressed
as
a
stage
bailiff
that
you
chevalier
how
are
you
my
friend
gaily
inquired
trublet
who
was
fond
of
actors
preferred
the
bad
ones
and
had
a
special
liking
for
chevalier
come
in
everybody
cried
nanteuil
this
is
a
it
a
mill
my
respects
none
the
less
mme
miller
replied
chevalier
i
warn
you
there
a
pack
of
idiots
out
in
front
would
you
believe
it
they
shut
me
up
that
no
reason
for
walking
in
without
knocking
replied
nanteuil
snappishly
the
doctor
pointed
out
that
monsieur
de
ligny
had
left
the
door
open
whereupon
nanteuil
turning
to
ligny
said
in
a
tone
of
tender
reproach
did
you
really
leave
the
door
open
but
when
one
comes
into
a
room
one
closes
the
door
on
other
people
it
is
one
of
the
first
things
one
is
taught
she
wrapped
herself
in
a
white
the
summoned
the
players
to
the
stage
she
grasped
the
hand
which
ligny
offered
her
and
exploring
his
wrist
with
her
fingers
dug
her
nail
into
the
spot
close
to
the
veins
where
the
skin
is
tender
then
she
disappeared
into
the
dark
corridor
chapter
ii
chevalier
having
resumed
his
ordinary
clothes
sat
in
a
corner
box
beside
madame
doulce
gazing
at
félicie
a
small
remote
figure
on
the
stage
and
remembering
the
days
when
he
had
held
her
in
his
arms
in
his
attic
in
the
rue
des
martyrs
he
wept
with
grief
and
rage
they
had
met
last
year
at
a
fête
given
under
the
patronage
of
lecureuil
the
deputy
a
benefit
performance
given
in
aid
of
poor
actors
of
the
ninth
he
had
prowled
around
her
dumb
famishing
and
with
blazing
eyes
for
a
whole
fortnight
he
had
pursued
her
incessantly
cold
and
unmoved
she
had
appeared
to
ignore
him
then
suddenly
she
surrendered
so
suddenly
that
when
he
left
her
that
day
still
radiant
and
amazed
he
had
said
a
stupid
thing
he
had
told
her
and
i
took
you
for
a
little
bit
of
china
for
three
whole
months
he
had
tasted
joys
acute
as
pain
then
félicie
had
grown
elusive
remote
and
estranged
she
loved
him
no
longer
he
sought
the
reason
but
could
not
discover
it
it
tortured
him
to
know
that
he
was
no
longer
loved
jealousy
tortured
him
still
more
it
was
true
that
in
the
first
beautiful
hours
of
his
love
he
had
known
that
félicie
had
a
lover
one
girmandel
a
court
bailiff
who
lived
in
the
rue
de
provence
and
he
had
felt
it
deeply
but
as
he
never
saw
him
he
had
formed
so
confused
and
an
idea
of
him
that
his
jealousy
lost
itself
in
uncertainty
félicie
assured
him
that
she
had
never
been
more
than
passive
in
her
intercourse
with
girmandel
that
she
had
not
even
pretended
to
care
for
him
he
believed
her
and
this
belief
gave
him
the
keenest
satisfaction
she
also
told
him
that
for
a
long
time
past
for
months
girmandel
had
been
nothing
more
than
a
friend
and
he
believed
her
in
short
he
was
deceiving
the
bailiff
and
it
was
agreeable
to
him
to
feel
that
he
enjoyed
this
advantage
he
had
learned
also
that
félicie
who
was
just
finishing
her
second
year
at
the
conservatoire
had
not
denied
herself
to
her
professor
but
the
grief
which
he
had
felt
because
of
this
was
softened
by
a
and
venerable
custom
now
robert
de
ligny
was
causing
him
intolerable
suffering
for
some
time
past
he
had
found
him
incessantly
dangling
about
her
he
could
not
doubt
that
she
loved
robert
and
although
he
sometimes
told
himself
that
she
had
not
yet
given
herself
to
this
man
it
was
not
that
he
believed
it
but
merely
that
he
was
fain
sometimes
to
mitigate
the
bitterness
of
his
sufferings
mechanical
applause
broke
out
at
the
back
of
the
theatre
and
a
few
members
of
the
orchestra
murmuring
inaudibly
clapped
their
hands
slowly
and
noiselessly
nanteuil
had
just
given
her
last
reply
to
jeanne
perrin
brava
she
is
delightful
dear
little
woman
sighed
madame
doulce
in
his
jealous
anger
chevalier
was
disloyal
lifting
a
finger
to
his
forehead
he
remarked
she
plays
with
then
placing
his
hand
upon
his
heart
he
added
it
is
with
this
that
one
should
act
thanks
dear
friend
thanks
murmured
madame
doulce
who
read
into
these
maxims
an
obvious
eulogy
of
herself
she
was
indeed
in
the
habit
of
asserting
that
all
good
acting
comes
from
the
heart
she
maintained
that
to
give
full
expression
to
a
passion
it
was
necessary
to
experience
it
and
to
feel
in
one
own
person
the
expressions
that
one
wished
to
represent
she
was
fond
of
referring
to
herself
as
an
example
of
this
when
appearing
as
a
tragedy
queen
after
draining
a
goblet
of
poison
on
the
stage
her
bowels
had
been
on
fire
all
night
nevertheless
she
was
given
to
saying
the
dramatic
art
is
an
imitative
art
and
one
imitates
an
emotion
all
the
better
for
not
having
experienced
it
and
to
illustrate
this
maxim
she
drew
yet
further
examples
from
her
triumphant
career
she
gave
a
deep
sigh
the
child
is
admirably
gifted
but
she
is
to
be
pitied
she
has
been
born
into
a
bad
period
there
is
no
longer
a
public
nowadays
no
critics
no
plays
no
theatres
no
artists
it
is
a
decadence
of
art
chevalier
shook
his
head
no
need
to
pity
her
he
said
she
will
have
all
that
she
can
wish
she
will
succeed
she
will
be
wealthy
she
is
a
selfish
little
jade
and
a
woman
who
is
selfish
can
get
anything
she
likes
but
for
people
with
hearts
there
nothing
left
but
to
hang
a
stone
round
one
neck
and
throw
oneself
into
the
river
but
i
too
i
shall
go
far
i
too
shall
climb
high
i
too
will
be
a
selfish
hound
he
got
up
and
went
out
without
waiting
for
the
end
of
the
play
he
did
not
return
to
félicie
for
fear
of
meeting
ligny
there
the
sight
of
whom
was
insupportable
and
because
by
avoiding
it
he
could
pretend
to
himself
that
ligny
had
not
returned
thither
conscious
of
physical
distress
on
going
away
from
her
he
took
five
or
six
turns
under
the
dark
deserted
arcades
of
the
odéon
went
down
the
steps
into
the
night
and
turned
up
the
rue
de
médicis
coachmen
were
dozing
on
their
boxes
while
waiting
for
the
end
of
the
performance
and
high
over
the
tops
of
the
the
moon
was
racing
through
the
clouds
treasuring
in
his
heart
an
absurd
yet
soothing
remnant
of
hope
he
went
this
night
as
on
other
nights
to
wait
for
félicie
at
her
mother
flat
chapter
iii
madame
nanteuil
lived
with
her
daughter
in
a
little
flat
on
the
fifth
story
of
a
house
in
the
boulevard
whose
windows
opened
upon
the
garden
of
the
luxembourg
she
gave
chevalier
a
friendly
welcome
for
she
thought
kindly
of
him
because
he
loved
félicie
and
because
the
latter
did
not
love
him
in
return
and
ignored
on
principle
the
fact
that
he
had
been
her
daughter
lover
she
made
him
sit
beside
her
in
the
where
a
coke
fire
was
burning
in
the
stove
in
the
lamplight
army
revolvers
and
sabres
with
golden
tassels
on

upon
the
wall
they
were
hung
about
a
woman
cuirass
which
was
provided
with
round
of
a
piece
of
armour
which
félicie
had
worn
last
winter
while
still
a
pupil
at
the
conservatoire
when
taking
the
part
of
joan
of
arc
at
the
house
of
a
spiritualistic
duchess
an
officer
widow
and
the
mother
of
an
actress
madame
nanteuil
whose
real
name
was
nantean
treasured
these
trophies
félicie
is
not
back
yet
monsieur
chevalier
i
do
expect
her
before
midnight
she
is
on
the
stage
till
the
end
of
the
play
i
know
i
was
in
the
first
piece
i
left
the
theatre
after
the
first
act
of
mère
oh
monsieur
chevalier
why
did
you
stay
till
the
end
my
daughter
would
have
been
so
pleased
if
you
had
waited
when
one
is
acting
one
likes
to
have
friends
in
the
house
chevalier
replied
ambiguously
oh
as
to
friends
there
are
plenty
of
those
about
you
are
mistaken
monsieur
chevalier
good
friends
are
scarce
madame
doulce
was
there
of
course
was
she
pleased
with
félicie
and
she
added
with
great
humility
i
should
indeed
be
happy
if
she
could
really
make
a
hit
it
is
so
difficult
to
come
to
the
fore
in
her
profession
for
a
girl
who
is
alone
without
support
without
influence
and
it
is
so
necessary
for
her
to
succeed
poor
child
chevalier
did
not
feel
disposed
to
lavish
any
pity
upon
félicie
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
he
replied
bluntly
no
need
to
worry
about
that
she
get
on
she
is
an
actress
heart
and
soul
she
has
it
in
her
bones
down
to
her
very
legs
madame
nanteuil
indulged
in
a
quiet
smile
poor
child
they
are
not
very
plump
her
legs
félicie
health
is
not
bad
but
she
must
not
overdo
it
she
often
has
fits
of
giddiness
and
sick
headaches
the
servant
came
in
to
place
on
the
table
a
dish
of
fried
sausage
a
bottle
of
wine
and
a
few
plates
meanwhile
chevalier
was
searching
in
his
mind
for
some
appropriate
fashion
of
asking
a
question
which
had
been
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
ever
since
he
had
set
foot
on
the
stairs
he
wanted
to
know
whether
félicie
was
still
meeting
girmandel
whose
name
he
never
heard
mentioned
nowadays
we
are
given
to
conceiving
desires
which
suit
themselves
to
our
condition
now
in
the
misery
of
his
existence
in
the
distress
of
his
heart
he
was
full
of
an
eager
desire
that
félicie
who
loved
him
no
longer
should
love
girmandel
whom
she
loved
but
little
and
he
hoped
with
all
his
heart
that
girmandel
would
keep
her
for
him
would
possess
her
wholly
and
leave
nothing
of
her
for
robert
de
ligny
the
idea
that
the
girl
might
be
with
girmandel
appeased
his
jealousy
and
he
dreaded
to
learn
that
she
had
broken
with
him
of
course
he
would
never
have
allowed
himself
to
question
a
mother
as
to
her
daughter
lovers
but
it
was
permissible
to
speak
of
girmandel
to
madame
nanteuil
who
saw
nothing
that
was
other
than
respectable
in
the
relations
of
her
household
with
the
government
official
who
was
married
and
the
father
of
two
charming
daughters
to
bring
girmandel
name
into
the
conversation
he
had
only
to
resort
to
a
stratagem
chevalier
hit
upon
one
which
he
thought
was
ingenious
by
the
way
he
remarked
i
saw
girmandel
just
now
in
a
carriage
madame
nanteuil
made
no
comment
he
was
driving
down
the
boulevard
in
a
cab
i
certainly
thought
i
recognized
him
i
should
be
greatly
surprised
if
it
he
madame
nanteuil
made
no
comment
his
fair
beard
his
high
colour
he
an
easy
man
to
recognize
girmandel
madame
nanteuil
made
no
comment
you
were
very
friendly
with
him
at
one
time
you
and
félicie
do
you
still
see
him
monsieur
girmandel
oh
yes
we
still
see
him
replied
madame
nanteuil
softly
these
words
made
chevalier
feel
almost
happy
but
she
had
deceived
him
she
had
not
spoken
the
truth
she
had
lied
out
of
and
in
order
not
to
reveal
a
domestic
secret
which
she
regarded
as
derogatory
to
the
honour
of
her
family
the
truth
was
that
being
carried
away
by
her
passion
for
ligny
félicie
had
given
girmandel
the
and
he
being
a
man
of
the
world
had
promptly
cut
off
supplies
madame
nanteuil
despite
her
years
had
resumed
an
old
lover
out
of
her
love
for
her
child
that
she
might
not
want
for
anything
she
had
renewed
her
former
liaison
with
tony
meyer
the
in
the
rue
de
clichy
tony
meyer
was
a
poor
substitute
for
girmandel
he
was
none
too
free
with
his
money
madame
nanteuil
who
was
wise
and
knew
the
value
of
things
did
not
complain
on
that
account
and
she
was
rewarded
for
her
devotion
for
in
the
six
weeks
during
which
she
had
been
loved
anew
she
had
grown
young
again
chevalier
following
up
his
idea
inquired
you
would
hardly
say
that
girmandel
was
still
a
young
man
would
you
he
is
not
old
said
madame
nanteuil
a
man
is
not
old
at
forty
a
bit
used
up
is
he
oh
dear
no
replied
madame
nanteuil
quite
calmly
chevalier
became
thoughtful
and
was
silent
madame
nanteuil
began
to
nod
then
being
aroused
from
her
somnolence
by
the
servant
who
brought
in
the
and
the
she
inquired
and
you
monsieur
chevalier
is
all
well
with
you
no
all
was
not
well
with
him
the
critics
were
out
to
down
him
and
the
proof
that
they
had
combined
against
him
was
that
they
all
said
the
same
thing
they
said
his
face
lacked
expression
my
face
lacking
in
expression
he
cried
indignantly
they
should
have
called
it
a
predestined
face
madame
nanteuil
i
aim
high
and
it
is
that
which
does
me
harm
for
example
in
nuit
du
which
is
being
rehearsed
now
i
am
florentin
i
have
only
six
lines
it
a
washout
but
i
have
increased
the
importance
of
the
character
enormously
durville
is
furious
he
deliberately
crabs
all
my
effects
madame
nanteuil
placid
and
kindly
found
words
to
comfort
him
obstacles
there
were
no
doubt
but
in
the
end
one
overcame
them
her
own
daughter
had
fallen
foul
of
the
of
certain
critics
twelve
said
chevalier
gloomily
félicie
is
late
madame
nanteuil
supposed
that
she
had
been
detained
by
madame
doulce
madame
doulce
as
a
rule
undertakes
to
see
her
home
and
you
know
she
never
hurries
herself
chevalier
rose
as
if
to
take
his
leave
to
show
that
he
remembered
his
manners
madame
nanteuil
begged
him
to
stay
do
go
félicie
wo
be
long
now
she
will
be
pleased
to
find
you
here
you
will
have
supper
with
her
madame
nanteuil
dozed
off
again
in
her
chair
chevalier
sat
gazing
in
silence
at
the
clock
hanging
on
the
wall
and
as
the
hand
travelled
across
the
dial
he
felt
a
burning
wound
in
his
heart
which
grew
bigger
and
bigger
and
each
little
stroke
of
the
pendulum
touched
him
to
the
quick
lending
a
keener
eye
to
his
jealousy
by
recording
the
moments
which
félicie
was
passing
with
ligny
for
he
was
now
convinced
that
they
were
together
the
stillness
of
the
night
interrupted
only
by
the
muffled
sound
of
the
cabs
bowling
along
the
boulevard
gave
reality
to
the
thoughts
and
images
which
tortured
him
he
could
see
them
awakened
with
a
start
by
the
sound
of
singing
on
the
pavement
below
madame
nanteuil
returned
to
the
thought
with
which
she
had
fallen
asleep
that
what
i
am
always
telling
félicie
one
must
be
discouraged
one
should
not
lose
heart
we
all
have
our
ups
and
downs
in
life
chevalier
nodded
acquiescence
but
those
who
suffer
he
said
only
get
what
they
deserve
it
needs
but
a
moment
to
free
oneself
from
all
one
troubles
is
it
so
she
admitted
the
fact
certainly
there
were
such
things
as
sudden
opportunities
especially
on
the
stage
heaven
knows
he
continued
in
a
deep
brooding
voice
it
not
the
stage
i
am
worrying
about
i
know
i
shall
make
a
name
for
myself
one
day
and
a
big
one
but
what
the
good
of
being
a
great
artist
if
one
is
happy
there
are
stupid
worries
which
are
terrible
pains
that
throb
in
your
temples
with
strokes
as
even
and
as
regular
as
the
ticking
of
that
clock
till
they
drive
you
mad
he
ceased
speaking
the
gloomy
gaze
of
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
trophy
hanging
on
the
wall
then
he
continued
these
stupid
worries
these
ridiculous
sufferings
if
one
endures
them
too
long
it
simply
means
that
one
is
a
coward
and
he
felt
the
butt
of
the
revolver
which
he
always
carried
in
his
pocket
madame
nanteuil
listened
to
him
serenely
with
that
gentle
determination
not
to
know
anything
which
had
been
her
one
talent
in
life
another
dreadful
thing
she
observed
is
to
decide
what
to
have
to
eat
félicie
is
sick
of
everything
there
no
knowing
what
to
get
for
her
after
that
the
flagging
conversation
languished
drawn
out
into
detached
phrases
which
had
no
particular
meaning
madame
nanteuil
the
servant
the
coke
fire
the
lamp
the
plate
of
sausage
awaited
félicie
in
depressing
silence
the
clock
struck
one
chevalier
suffering
had
by
this
time
attained
the
serenity
of
a
flood
tide
he
was
now
certain
the
cabs
were
not
so
frequent
and
their
wheels
echoed
more
loudly
along
the
street
the
rumbling
of
one
of
these
cabs
suddenly
ceased
outside
the
house
a
few
seconds
later
he
heard
the
slight
grating
of
a
key
in
the
lock
the
slamming
of
the
door
and
light
footsteps
in
the
outer
room
the
clock
marked
minutes
past
one
he
was
suddenly
full
of
agitation
yet
hopeful
she
had
come
who
could
tell
what
she
would
say
she
might
offer
the
most
natural
explanation
of
her
late
arrival
félicie
entered
the
room
her
hair
in
disorder
her
eyes
shining
her
cheeks
white
her
bruised
lips
a
vivid
red
she
was
tired
indifferent
mute
happy
and
lovely
seeming
to
guard
beneath
her
cloak
which
she
held
wrapped
about
her
with
both
hands
some
remnant
of
warmth
and
voluptuous
pleasure
i
was
beginning
to
be
worried
said
her
mother
are
you
going
to
unfasten
your
cloak
i
hungry
she
replied
she
dropped
into
a
chair
before
the
little
round
table
throwing
her
cloak
over
the
back
of
the
chair
she
revealed
her
slender
figure
in
its
little
black
schoolgirl
dress
and
resting
her
left
elbow
on
the
she
proceeded
to
stick
her
fork
into
the
sliced
sausage
did
everything
go
off
well
asked
madame
nanteuil
quite
well
you
see
chevalier
has
come
to
keep
you
company
it
is
kind
of
him
is
it
oh
chevalier
well
let
him
come
to
the
table
and
without
replying
further
to
her
mother
questions
she
began
to
eat
greedy
and
charming
like
ceres
in
the
old
woman
house
then
she
pushed
aside
her
plate
and
leaning
back
in
her
chair
with
eyes
and
parted
lips
she
smiled
a
smile
that
was
akin
to
a
kiss
madame
nanteuil
having
drunk
her
glass
of
mulled
wine
rose
to
her
feet
you
will
excuse
me
monsieur
chevalier
i
have
my
accounts
to
bring
up
to
date
this
was
the
formula
which
she
usually
employed
to
announce
that
she
was
going
to
bed
left
alone
with
félicie
chevalier
said
to
her
angrily
i
know
i
a
fool
and
a
groveller
but
i
going
mad
for
love
of
you
do
you
hear
félicie
i
should
think
i
do
hear
you
need
shout
like
that
it
ridiculous
is
it
no
it
not
ridiculous
it
she
did
not
complete
the
sentence
he
drew
nearer
to
her
dragging
his
chair
with
him
you
came
in
at
minutes
past
one
it
was
ligny
who
saw
you
home
i
know
it
he
brought
you
back
in
a
cab
i
heard
it
stop
outside
the
house
as
she
did
not
reply
he
continued
deny
it
if
you
can
she
remained
silent
and
he
repeated
in
an
urgent
almost
appealing
tone
tell
me
he
did
had
she
been
so
inclined
she
might
with
a
phrase
with
a
single
word
with
a
tiny
movement
of
head
or
shoulders
have
rendered
him
perfectly
submissive
and
almost
happy
but
she
maintained
a
malicious
silence
with
compressed
lips
and
a
look
in
her
eyes
she
seemed
as
though
lost
in
a
dream
he
sighed
hoarsely
fool
that
i
was
i
did
think
of
that
i
told
myself
you
would
come
home
as
on
other
nights
with
madame
doulce
or
else
alone
if
i
had
only
known
that
you
were
going
to
let
that
fellow
see
you
home
well
what
would
you
have
done
had
you
known
it
i
should
have
followed
you
by
god
she
stared
at
him
with
hard
unnaturally
bright
eyes
that
i
forbid
you
to
do
understand
me
if
i
learn
that
you
have
followed
me
even
once
i
never
see
you
again
to
begin
with
you
have
the
right
to
follow
me
i
suppose
i
am
free
to
do
as
i
like
choking
with
astonishment
and
anger
he
stammered
have
the
right
to
have
the
right
to
you
tell
me
i
have
the
right
no
you
have
the
right
moreover
i
wo
have
it
her
face
assumed
an
expression
of
disgust
it
a
mean
trick
to
spy
on
a
woman
if
you
once
try
to
find
out
where
i
going
i
send
you
about
your
business
and
quickly
at
that
then
he
murmured
thunderstruck
we
are
nothing
to
each
other
i
am
nothing
to
you
we
have
never
belonged
to
each
other
but
see
félicie
remember
but
she
was
losing
patience
well
what
do
you
want
me
to
remember
félicie
remember
that
you
gave
yourself
to
me
my
dear
boy
you
really
ca
expect
me
to
think
of
that
all
day
it
would
be
proper
he
looked
at
her
for
a
while
more
in
curiosity
than
in
anger
and
said
to
her
half
bitterly
half
gently
they
may
well
call
you
a
selfish
little
jade
be
one
félicie
be
one
as
much
as
you
like
what
does
it
matter
since
i
love
you
you
are
mine
i
am
going
to
take
you
back
i
am
going
to
take
you
back
and
keep
you
think
i
ca
go
on
suffering
for
ever
like
a
poor
dumb
beast
listen
i
start
with
a
clean
slate
let
us
begin
to
love
one
another
over
again
and
this
time
it
will
be
all
right
and
you
be
mine
for
good
mine
only
i
am
an
honest
man
you
know
that
you
can
depend
on
me
i
marry
you
as
soon
as
i
got
a
position
she
gazed
at
him
with
disdainful
surprise
he
believed
that
she
had
doubts
as
to
his
dramatic
future
and
in
order
to
banish
them
he
said
erect
on
his
long
legs
do
you
believe
in
my
star
félicie
you
are
wrong
i
can
feel
that
i
am
capable
of
creating
great
parts
let
them
only
give
me
a
part
and
they
see
and
i
have
in
me
not
only
comedy
but
drama
tragedy
yes
tragedy
i
can
deliver
verse
properly
and
that
is
a
talent
which
is
becoming
rare
in
these
days
so
do
imagine
félicie
that
i
am
insulting
you
when
i
offer
you
marriage
far
from
it
we
will
marry
later
on
as
soon
as
it
is
possible
and
suitable
of
course
there
is
no
need
for
hurry
meanwhile
we
will
resume
our
pleasant
habits
of
the
rue
des
martyrs
you
remember
félicie
we
were
so
happy
there
the
bed
was
wide
but
we
used
to
say
that
does
matter
i
have
now
two
fine
rooms
in
the
rue
de
la
behind
your
portrait
hangs
on
every
wall
you
will
find
there
the
little
bed
of
the
rue
des
martyrs
listen
to
me
i
beg
of
you
i
have
suffered
too
much
i
will
not
suffer
any
longer
i
demand
that
you
shall
be
mine
mine
only
while
he
was
speaking
félicie
had
taken
from
the
mantelpiece
the
pack
of
cards
with
which
her
mother
played
every
night
and
was
spreading
them
out
on
the
table
mine
only
you
hear
me
félicie
do
disturb
me
i
am
busy
with
a
game
of
patience
listen
to
me
félicie
i
wo
have
you
receiving
that
fool
in
your
looking
at
her
cards
she
murmured
all
the
blacks
are
at
the
bottom
of
the
pack
i
say
that
fool
he
is
a
diplomatist
and
nowadays
the
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
is
the
refuge
of
incompetents
raising
his
voice
he
continued
félicie
for
your
own
sake
as
well
as
for
mine
listen
to
me
well
do
shout
then
mama
is
asleep
he
continued
in
muffled
tones
just
get
it
into
your
head
that
i
do
intend
that
ligny
shall
be
your
lover
she
raised
her
spiteful
little
face
and
replied
and
if
he
is
my
lover
he
moved
a
step
closer
to
her
raising
his
chair
gazing
at
her
with
the
eye
of
a
madman
and
laughing
a
cracked
laugh
if
he
is
your
lover
he
wo
be
so
for
long
and
he
dropped
the
chair
now
she
was
alarmed
she
forced
herself
to
smile
you
know
very
well
i
joking
she
succeeded
without
much
difficulty
in
making
him
believe
that
she
had
spoken
thus
merely
to
punish
him
because
he
was
getting
unbearable
he
became
calmer
she
then
informed
him
that
she
was
tired
out
that
she
was
dropping
with
sleep
at
last
he
decided
to
go
home
on
the
landing
he
turned
and
said
félicie
i
advise
you
if
you
wish
to
avoid
a
tragedy
not
to
see
ligny
again
she
cried
through
the

that

chapter

in
the
dark
auditorium
large
linen
sheets
protected
the
balcony
and
the
boxes
the
orchestra
was
covered
with
a
huge
which
being
turned
back
at
the
edges
left
room
for
a
few
human
figures
indistinctly
seen
in
the
gloom
actors
costumiers
friends
of
the

mothers
and
lovers
and
actresses
here
and
there
shone
a
pair
of
eyes
from
the
black
recesses
of
the
boxes
they
were
rehearsing
for
the
time
nuit
du
octobre
a
celebrated
drama
dating
twenty
years
back
which
had
not
as
yet
been
performed
in
this
theatre
the
actors
knew
their
parts
and
the
following
day
had
been
chosen
for
that
last
private
rehearsal
which
on
stages
less
austere
than
that
of
the
odéon
is
known
as
the
rehearsal
nanteuil
had
no
part
in
the
play
but
she
had
had
business
at
the
theatre
that
day
and
as
she
had
been
informed
that
was
execrable
in
the
part
of
general
malet
wife
she
had
come
to
have
a
peep
at
her
concealed
in
the
depths
of
a
box
the
great
scene
of
the
second
act
was
about
to
begin
the
stage
setting
represented
an
attic
in
the
private
asylum
where
the
conspirator
was
confined
in
durville
who
filled
the
part
of
general
malet
had
just
made
his
entrance
he
was
rehearsing
in
costume
a
long
blue
with
a
collar
reaching
above
his
ears
and
of
chamois
leather
he
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
make
up
his
face
for
the
part
the
soldierly
face
of
the
general
of
the
empire
ornamented
with
the
whiskers
which
were
handed
down
by
the
victors
of
austerlitz
to
their
sons
the
bourgeois
of
july
standing
erect
his
right
elbow
resting
in
his
left
hand
his
brow
supported
by
his
right
hand
his
deep
voice
and
his
breeches
expressed
his
pride
alone
and
without
funds
from
the
depths
of
a
prison
to
attack
this
colossus
who
commands
a
million
soldiers
and
who
causes
all
the
peoples
and
kings
of
europe
to
tremble
well
this
colossus
shall
fall
crashing
to
the
ground
from
the
back
of
the
stage
old
maury
who
was
playing
the
conspirator
jacquemont
delivered
his
reply
he
may
crush
us
in
his
downfall
suddenly
cries
at
once
plaintive
and
angry
arose
from
the
orchestra
the
author
was
exploding
he
was
a
man
of
seventy
brimming
over
with
youth
what
do
i
see
there
at
the
back
of
the
stage
it
not
an
actor
it
a
we
shall
have
to
send
for
the
bricklayers
the
to
move
it
maury
do
get
a
move
on
confound
you
maury
shifted
his
position
he
may
crush
us
in
his
downfall
i
realize
that
it
will
not
be
your
fault
general
your
proclamation
is
excellent
you
promise
them
a
constitution
liberty
equality
it
is
machiavellian
durville
replied
and
in
the
best
sense
an
incorrigible
breed
they
are
making
ready
to
violate
the
oaths
that
they
have
not
yet
taken
and
because
they
lie
they
believe
themselves
machiavellis
what
will
you
do
with
absolute
power
you
simpletons
the
strident
voice
of
the
author
ground
out
you
are
right
off
the
track
dauville
i
asked
the
astonished
durville
yes
you
dauville
you
do
not
understand
a
word
of
what
you
are
saying
in
order
to
humiliate
them
to
take
them
down
a
peg
this
man
who
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
had
never
forgotten
the
name
of
a
or
a
disdained
to
remember
the
names
of
the
most
illustrious
actors
dauville
my
friend
just
do
that
over
again
for
me
he
could
play
every
part
well
jovial
funereal
violent
tender
impetuous
affectionate
he
assumed
at
will
a
deep
or
a
piping
voice
he
sighed
he
roared
he
laughed
he
wept
he
could
transform
himself
like
the
man
in
the
into
a
flame
a
river
a
woman
a
tiger
in
the
wings
the
actors
exchanged
only
short
and
meaningless
phrases
their
freedom
of
speech
their
easy
morals
the
familiarity
of
their
manners
did
not
prevent
their
retaining
so
much
of
hypocrisy
as
is
needful
in
any
assemblage
of
men
if
people
are
to
look
upon
one
another
without
feelings
of
horror
and
disgust
there
even
prevailed
in
this
workshop
in
full
activity
a
seemly
appearance
of
harmony
and
union
a
oneness
of
feeling
created
by
the
thought
lofty
or
commonplace
of
the
author
a
spirit
of
order
which
compelled
all
rivalries
and
all
illwill
to
transform
themselves
into
goodwill
and
harmonious
nanteuil
sitting
in
her
box
felt
uneasy
at
the
thought
that
chevalier
was
close
at
hand
for
the
last
two
days
since
the
night
on
which
he
had
uttered
his
obscure
threats
she
had
not
seen
him
again
and
the
fear
with
which
he
had
inspired
her
still
possessed
her
félicie
if
you
wish
to
prevent
a
tragedy
i
advise
you
not
to
see
ligny
again
what
did
those
words
portend
she
pondered
deeply
over
chevalier
this
young
fellow
who
only
two
days
earlier
had
seemed
to
her
commonplace
and
insignificant
of
whom
she
had
seen
a
good
deal
too
much
whom
she
knew
by
heart
how
mysterious
and
full
of
secrets
he
now
appeared
to
her
how
suddenly
it
had
dawned
upon
her
that
she
did
not
know
him
of
what
was
he
capable
she
tried
to
guess
what
was
he
going
to
do
probably
nothing
all
men
who
are
thrown
over
by
a
woman
utter
threats
and
do
nothing
but
was
chevalier
a
man
quite
like
all
the
rest
people
did
say
that
he
was
crazy
that
was
mere
talk
but
she
herself
did
not
feel
sure
that
there
might
not
be
a
spark
of
insanity
in
him
she
was
studying
him
now
with
genuine
interest
highly
intelligent
herself
she
had
never
discovered
any
great
signs
of
intelligence
in
him
but
he
had
on
several
occasions
astonished
her
by
the
obstinacy
of
his
will
she
could
remember
his
performing
acts
of
the
fiercest
energy
jealous
by
nature
there
were
yet
certain
matters
which
he
understood
he
knew
what
a
woman
is
compelled
to
do
in
order
to
win
a
place
on
the
stage
or
to
dress
herself
properly
but
he
could
not
endure
to
be
deceived
for
the
sake
of
love
was
he
the
sort
of
man
to
commit
a
crime
to
do
something
dreadful
that
was
what
she
could
not
decide
she
recalled
his
mania
for
handling
firearms
when
she
used
to
visit
him
in
the
rue
des
martyrs
she
always
found
him
in
his
room
taking
an
old
to
pieces
and
cleaning
it
and
yet
he
never
went
shooting
he
boasted
of
being
a
dead
shot
and
carried
a
revolver
on
his
person
but
what
did
that
prove
never
before
had
she
thought
so
much
about
him
nanteuil
was
tormenting
herself
in
this
fashion
in
her
box
when
jenny
fagette
came
to
join
her
there
jenny
fagette
slender
and
fragile
the
incarnation
of
alfred
de
musset
muse
who
at
night
wore
out
her
eyes
of
by
scribbling
society
notes
and
fashion
articles
a
mediocre
actress
but
a
clever
and
wonderfully
energetic
woman
she
was
nanteuil
most
intimate
friend
they
recognized
in
each
other
remarkable
qualities
qualities
which
differed
from
those
which
each
discovered
in
herself
and
they
acted
in
concert
as
the
two
great
powers
of
the
odéon
nevertheless
fagette
was
doing
her
best
to
take
ligny
away
from
her
friend
not
from
inclination
for
she
was
insensible
as
a
stick
and
held
men
in
contempt
but
with
the
idea
that
a
liaison
with
a
diplomatist
would
procure
her
certain
advantages
and
above
all
in
order
not
to
miss
the
opportunity
of
doing
something
scandalous
nanteuil
was
aware
of
this
she
knew
that
all
her
ellen
midi
duvernet
herschell
falempin
stella
were
trying
to
take
ligny
from
her
she
had
seen
louise
dalle
who
dressed
like
a
and
always
had
the
air
of
being
about
to
storm
an
omnibus
and
retained
even
in
her
provocations
and
accidental
contacts
the
appearance
of
incurable
respectability
pursue
ligny
with
her
lanky
legs
and
beset
him
with
the
glances
of
a
pasiphae
she
had
also
surprised
the
oldest
actress
of
the
theatre
their
excellent
mother
ravaud
in
a
corridor
baring
at
ligny
approach
all
that
was
left
to
her
her
magnificent
arms
which
had
been
famous
for
forty
years
fagette
with
disgust
and
the
tip
of
a
gloved
finger
called
attention
to
the
scene
through
which
durville
old
maury
and
were
struggling
just
look
at
those
people
they
look
as
if
they
were
playing
at
the
bottom
of
thirty
fathoms
of
water
it
because
the
top
lights
are
not
lit
not
a
bit
of
it
this
theatre
always
looks
as
if
it
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
to
think
that
i
too
in
a
moment
have
to
enter
that
aquarium
nanteuil
you
must
not
stop
longer
than
one
season
in
this
theatre
one
is
drowned
in
it
but
look
at
them
look
at
them
durville
was
becoming
almost
ventriloqual
in
order
to
seem
more
solemn
and
more
virile
peace
the
abolition
of
the
combined
martial
and
civil
law
and
of
conscription
higher
pay
for
the
troops
in
the
absence
of
funds
a
few
drafts
on
the
bank
a
few
commissions
suitably
distributed
these
are
infallible
means
madame
doulce
entered
the
box
unfastening
her
cloak
with
its
pathetic
lining
of
old
she
produced
a
small
book
they
are
madame
de
sévigné
letters
she
said
you
know
that
next
sunday
i
am
going
to
give
a
reading
of
the
best
of
madame
de
letters
where
asked
fagette
salle
renard
it
must
have
been
some
remote
and
little
known
hall
for
nanteuil
and
fagette
had
not
heard
of
it
i
am
giving
this
reading
for
the
benefit
of
the
three
poor
orphans
left
by
lacour
the
actor
who
died
so
sadly
of
consumption
this
winter
i
am
counting
on
you
my
darlings
to
dispose
of
some
tickets
for
me
all
the
same
she
really
is
ridiculous
said
nanteuil
some
one
scratched
at
the
door
of
the
box
it
was
constantin
marc
the
youthful
author
of
a
play
which
the
odéon
was
going
to
rehearse
immediately
and
constantin
marc
although
a
countryman
living
in
the
forest
could
henceforth
breathe
only
in
the
theatre
nanteuil
was
to
take
the
principal
part
in
the
play
he
gazed
upon
her
with
emotion
as
the
precious
amphora
destined
to
be
the
receptacle
of
his
thought
meanwhile
durville
continued
hoarsely
if
our
france
can
be
saved
only
at
the
price
of
our
life
and
honour
i
shall
say
with
the
man
of
our
memory
fagette
pointed
her
finger
at
a
bloated
youth
who
was
sitting
in
the
orchestra
resting
his
chin
on
his
is
that
baron
deutz
need
you
ask
replied
nanteuil
ellen
midi
is
in
the
cast
she
plays
in
the
fourth
act
baron
deutz
has
come
to
display
himself
just
wait
a
minute
my
children
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
that
cub
he
met
me
yesterday
in
the
place
de
la
concorde
and
he
did
bow
to
me
what
baron
deutz
he
could
have
seen
you
he
saw
me
perfectly
well
but
he
was
with
his
people
i
am
going
to
have
him
on
toast
just
you
watch
my
dears
she
called
him
very
softly
deutz
deutz
the
baron
came
towards
her
smiling
and
with
himself
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
edge
of
the
box
tell
me
monsieur
deutz
when
you
met
me
yesterday
were
you
in
very
bad
company
that
you
did
not
raise
your
hat
to
me
he
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
i
i
was
with
my
sister
oh
on
the
stage
hanging
upon
durville
neck
was
exclaiming
go
victorious
or
defeated
in
good
or
evil
fortune
your
glory
will
be
equally
great
come
what
may
i
shall
know
how
to
show
myself
the
wife
of
a
hero
that
will
do
madame
said
pradel
just
at
that
moment
chevalier
made
his
entry
and
immediately
the
author
tearing
his
hair
let
loose
a
flood
of
imprecations
do
you
call
that
an
entry
it
a
tumble
a
catastrophe
a
cataclysm
ye
gods
a
meteor
an
aerolith
a
bit
of
the
moon
falling
on
to
the
stage
would
be
less
horribly
disastrous
i
will
take
off
my
play
chevalier
come
in
again
my
good
fellow
the
artist
who
had
designed
the
costumes
michel
a
fair
young
man
with
a
mystic
beard
was
seated
in
the
first
row
on
the
arm
of
a
stall
he
leaned
over
and
whispered
into
the
ear
of
roger
the
and
to
think
it
the
time
that
he
dropped
on
chevalier
with
the
same
fury
well
you
know
chevalier
is
rottenly
bad
replied
roger
without
hesitation
it
is
that
he
is
bad
returned
michel
indulgently
but
he
always
seems
to
be
laughing
and
nothing
could
be
worse
for
a
comedy
actor
i
knew
him
when
he
was
quite
a
kid
at
montmartre
at
school
his
masters
used
to
ask
him
are
you
laughing
he
was
not
laughing
he
had
no
desire
to
laugh
he
used
to
get
his
ears
boxed
from
morning
to
night
his
parents
wanted
to
put
him
in
a
chemical
factory
but
he
had
dreams
of
the
stage
and
spent
his
days
on
the
butte
montmartre
in
the
studio
of
the
painter
montalent
montalent
at
that
time
was
working
day
and
night
on
his
of
saint
a
huge
picture
which
was
commissioned
for
the
cathedral
of
carthage
one
day
montalent
said
to
him
a
little
less
noise
shouted
pradel
said
to
him
since
you
have
nothing
to
do
just
sit
for
philippe
the
bold
pleasure
said
chevalier
montalent
told
him
to
assume
the
attitude
of
a
man
bowed
down
with
grief
more
he
stuck
two
tears
as
big
as
spectacle
lenses
on
his
cheeks
he
finished
his
picture
forwarded
it
to
carthage
and
had
half
a
dozen
bottles
of
champagne
sent
up
three
months
later
he
received
from
father
cornemuse
the
head
of
the
french
missions
in
tunis
a
letter
informing
him
that
his
painting
of
the
of
saint
having
been
submitted
to
the
had
been
refused
by
his
eminence
because
of
the
unseemly
expression
on
the
face
of
philippe
the
bold
who
was
laughing
as
he
watched
the
saintly
king
his
father
dying
on
a
bed
of
straw
montalent
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
it
he
was
furious
and
wanted
to
take
proceedings
against
the
his
painting
was
returned
to
him
he
unpacked
it
gazed
at
it
in
gloomy
silence
and
suddenly
shouted
true
philippe
the
bold
appears
to
be
splitting
his
sides
with
laughter
what
a
fool
i
have
been
i
gave
him
the
head
of
chevalier
who
always
seems
to
be
laughing
the
brute
will
you
be
quiet
there
yelled
pradel
and
the
author
exclaimed
pradel
my
dear
boy
just
pitch
all
those
people
into
the
street
indefatigable
he
was
arranging
the
scene

little
farther

more
light
one
ca
see
an
inch
dauville
my
dear
friend
what
are
you
doing
there
in
front
of
the
prompter
box
you
seem
glued
to
it
just
get
into
your
head
once
for
all
that
you
are
not
the
statue
of
general
malet
that
you
are
general
malet
in
person
that
my
play
is
not
a
catalogue
of
figures
but
a
living
moving
tragedy
one
which
brings
the
tears
into
your
eyes
and
words
failed
him
and
he
sobbed
for
a
long
while
into
his
handkerchief
then
he
roared
holy
thunder
pradel
romilly
where
is
romilly
ah
there
he
is
the
villain
romilly
i
told
you
to
put
the
stove
nearer
the
you
have
not
done
so
what
are
you
thinking
of
my
friend
the
rehearsal
was
suddenly
brought
to
a
standstill
by
a
serious
difficulty
chevalier
the
bearer
of
documents
on
which
hung
the
fate
of
the
empire
was
to
escape
from
his
prison
by
the
the
stage
business
had
not
yet
been
settled
it
had
been
impossible
to
do
so
before
the
setting
of
the
stage
was
completed
it
was
now
discovered
that
the
measurements
had
been
wrongly
taken
and
the
was
not
accessible
the
author
leapt
on
to
the
stage
romilly
my
friend
the
stove
is
not
in
the
place
fixed
on
how
can
you
expect
chevalier
to
get
out
through
the
push
the
stove
to
the
right
at
once
i
willing
enough
said
romilly
but
we
shall
be
blocking
up
the
door
what
that
we
shall
be
blocking
up
the
door
precisely
the
manager
of
the
theatre
the
the
stood
examining
the
with
gloomy
attention
while
the
author
held
his
peace
do
worry
master
said
chevalier
there
no
need
to
change
anything
i
shall
be
able
to
jump
out
all
right
climbing
on
to
the
stove
he
did
indeed
succeed
in
grasping
the
sill
of
the
window
and
in
hoisting
himself
up
until
his
elbows
rested
on
it
a
feat
that
had
seemed
impossible
a
murmur
of
admiration
rose
from
the
stage
the
wings
and
the
house
chevalier
had
produced
an
astonishing
impression
by
his
strength
and
agility
splendid
exclaimed
the
author
chevalier
my
friend
that
is
perfect
the
fellow
is
as
nimble
as
a
monkey
i
be
hanged
if
any
of
you
could
do
as
much
if
all
the
parts
were
in
such
good
hands
as
that
of
florentin
the
play
would
be
lauded
to
the
skies
nanteuil
in
her
box
almost
admired
him
for
one
brief
second
he
had
seemed
to
her
more
than
man
both
man
and
gorilla
and
the
fear
with
which
he
had
inspired
her
was
immeasurably
increased
she
did
not
love
him
she
had
never
loved
him
she
did
not
desire
him
it
was
a
long
time
since
she
had
really
wanted
him
and
for
some
days
past
she
had
been
unable
to
imagine
herself
taking
pleasure
in
any
other
than
ligny
but
had
she
at
that
moment
found
herself
alone
with
chevalier
she
would
have
felt
powerless
and
she
would
have
sought
to
appease
him
by
her
submission
as
one
appeases
a
supernatural
power
on
the
stage
while
an
empire
was
being
lowered
from
the
flies
through
all
the
noise
of
the
running
gear
and
the
grounding
of
the
supports
the
author
held
the
whole
of
the
company
as
well
as
all
the
supers
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
at
the
same
time
gave
them
all
advice
or
illustrated
what
he
wanted
of
them
you
the
big
woman
the
madame
ravaud
have
you
ever
heard
the
women
calling
in
the
your
fill
ladies
this
way
for
a
treat
it
is
just
learn
the
tune
by
and
you
just
give
me
your
drum
i
going
to
teach
you
how
to
beat
the
roll
confound
it
fagette
my
child
what
the
mischief
are
you
doing
at
a
ball
given
by
the
minister
of
police
if
you
have
any
stockings
with
golden
clocks
take
off
those
knitted
woollen
stockings
immediately
this
is
the
very
last
play
that
i
shall
produce
in
this
theatre
where
is
the
colonel
of
the
cohort
so
it
you
well
then
my
friend
your
soldiers
march
past
like
so
many
pigs
madame
come
forward
a
little
so
that
i
may
teach
you
how
to
curtsy
he
had
a
hundred
eyes
a
hundred
mouths
and
arms
and
legs
everywhere
in
the
house
romilly
was
shaking
hands
with
monsieur
gombaut
of
the
academy
of
moral
sciences
who
had
dropped
in
as
a
neighbour
you
may
say
what
you
will
monsieur
gombaut
it
is
perhaps
not
accurate
as
far
as
facts
are
concerned
but
it
drama
malet
conspiracy
replied
monsieur
gombaut
remains
and
will
doubtless
remain
for
a
long
time
to
come
an
historical
enigma
the
author
of
this
drama
has
taken
advantage
of
those
points
which
are
obscure
in
order
to
introduce
dramatic
elements
but
what
to
my
thinking
is
beyond
a
doubt
is
that
general
malet
although
associated
with
royalists
was
himself
a
republican
and
was
working
for
the
of
popular
government
in
the
course
of
his
examination
during
the
trial
he
pronounced
a
sublime
and
profound
utterance
when
the
presiding
judge
of
the
asked
him
were
your
accomplices
malet
replied
france
and
you
yourself
had
i
succeeded
leaning
on
the
edge
of
nanteuil
box
an
aged
sculptor
as
venerable
and
as
handsome
as
an
ancient
satyr
was
gazing
with
glistening
eye
and
smiling
lips
at
the
stage
which
at
that
moment
was
in
a
state
of
commotion
and
confusion
are
you
pleased
with
the
play
master
nanteuil
asked
him
and
the
master
who
had
no
eyes
for
anything
but
bones
tendons
and
muscles
replied
yes
indeed
mademoiselle
yes
indeed
i
see
over
there
a
little
creature
little
midi
whose
shoulder
attachment
is
a
jewel
he
outlined
it
with
his
thumb
tears
welled
up
into
his
eyes
chevalier
asked
if
he
might
enter
the
box
he
was
happy
less
on
account
of
his
prodigious
success
than
at
seeing
félicie
he
dreamed
in
his
infatuation
that
she
had
come
for
his
sake
that
she
loved
him
that
she
was
returning
to
him
she
feared
him
and
as
she
was
timid
she
flattered
him
i
congratulate
you
chevalier
you
were
simply
astounding
your
exit
is
a
marvel
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
i
am
not
the
only
one
to
say
so
fagette
thought
you
were
wonderful
really
asked
chevalier
it
was
one
of
the
happiest
moments
of
his
life
a
shrieking
voice
issued
from
the
deserted
heights
of
the
third
galleries
sounding
through
the
house
like
the
whistle
of
a
locomotive
one
ca
hear
a
word
you
say
my
children
speak
louder
and
pronounce
your
words
distinctly
the
author
appeared
infinitely
small
in
the
shadow
of
the
dome
thereupon
the
utterance
of
the
players
who
were
collected
at
the
front
of
the
stage
around
a
naphtha
flare
rose
more
distinctly
the
emperor
will
allow
the
troops
to
rest
for
some
weeks
at
moscow
then
with
the
rapidity
of
an
eagle
he
will
swoop
down
upon
st
petersburg
spades
clubs
trump
two
points
to
me
there
we
shall
spend
the
winter
and
next
spring
we
shall
penetrate
into
india
crossing
persia
and
the
british
power
will
be
a
thing
of
the
past
in
diamonds
and
i
the
four
aces
by
the
way
gentlemen
what
say
you
to
the
imperial
decree
concerning
the
actors
of
paris
dated
from
the
kremlin
there
an
end
of
the
squabbles
between
mademoiselle
mars
and
mademoiselle
leverd
do
look
at
fagette
said
nanteuil
she
is
charming
in
that
blue
dress
trimmed
with
chinchilla
madame
doulce
brought
out
from
under
her
furs
a
stack
of
tickets
already
soiled
through
having
been
too
frequently
offered
master
she
said
addressing
constantin
marc
you
know
that
next
sunday
i
am
to
give
a
reading
with
appropriate
remarks
of
the
best
letters
of
madame
de
sévigné
for
the
benefit
of
the
three
poor
orphans
left
by
lacour
the
actors
who
died
this
winter
in
so
deplorable
a
fashion
had
he
any
talent
asked
constantin
marc
none
whatever
said
nanteuil
well
then
in
what
way
is
his
death
deplorable
oh
master
sighed
madame
doulce
do
not
pretend
to
be
unfeeling
i
am
not
pretending
to
be
unfeeling
but
here
is
something
that
surprises
me
the
value
which
we
set
upon
the
lives
of
those
who
are
not
of
the
slightest
interest
to
us
we
seem
as
though
we
believe
that
life
is
in
itself
something
precious
yet
nature
teaches
us
plainly
enough
that
nothing
is
more
worthless
and
contemptible
in
former
days
people
were
less
besmeared
with
sentimentalism
each
of
us
held
his
own
life
to
be
infinitely
precious
but
he
did
not
profess
any
respect
whatever
for
the
life
of
others
we
were
nearer
to
nature
in
those
days
we
were
created
to
devour
one
another
but
our
debilitated
enervated
hypocritical
race
wallows
in
a
sly
cannibalism
while
we
are
gulping
one
another
down
we
declare
that
life
is
sacred
and
we
no
longer
dare
to
confess
that
life
is
murder
that
life
is
murder
echoed
chevalier
dreamily
without
grasping
the
meaning
of
the
words
then
he
poured
forth
a
string
of
nebulous
ideas
murder
and
bloodshed
that
may
be
but
amusing
bloodshed
and
comical
murder
life
is
a
burlesque
catastrophe
a
terrible
comedy
the
mask
of
carnival
over
cheeks
that
is
what
life
means
to
the
artist
the
artist
on
the
stage
and
the
artist
in
action
nanteuil
uneasily
sought
a
meaning
in
these
confused
phrases
the
actor
continued
excitedly
life
is
yet
another
thing
it
is
the
flower
and
the
knife
it
is
to
see
red
one
day
and
blue
the
next
it
is
hatred
and
love
ravishing
delightful
hatred
cruel
love
monsieur
chevalier
asked
constantin
marc
in
the
quietest
of
tones
does
it
not
seem
to
you
natural
to
be
a
murderer
and
do
you
not
think
that
it
is
merely
the
fear
of
being
killed
that
prevents
us
from
killing
chevalier
replied
in
deep
pensive
tones
most
certainly
not
it
would
not
be
the
fear
of
being
killed
that
would
prevent
me
from
killing
i
have
no
fear
of
death
but
i
feel
a
respect
for
the
life
of
others
i
am
humane
in
spite
of
myself
i
have
for
some
time
past
been
seriously
considering
the
question
which
you
have
just
asked
me
monsieur
constantin
marc
i
have
pondered
over
it
day
and
night
and
i
know
now
that
i
could
not
kill
any
one
at
this
nanteuil
filled
with
joy
cast
upon
him
a
look
of
contempt
she
feared
him
no
longer
and
she
could
not
forgive
him
for
having
alarmed
her
she
rose
good
evening
i
have
a
headache
till
monsieur
constantin
marc
and
she
went
out
briskly
chevalier
ran
after
her
down
the
corridor
descended
the
stage
staircase
behind
her
and
rejoined
her
by
the
stage
doorkeeper
box
félicie
come
and
dine
with
me
at
our
cabaret
i
should
be
so
glad
if
you
would
will
you
good
gracious
no
why
wo
you
leave
me
alone
you
are
bothering
me
she
tried
to
escape
he
detained
her
i
love
you
so
do
be
too
cruel
to
me
taking
a
step
towards
him
her
lips
curling
back
from
her
clenched
teeth
she
hissed
into
his
ear
it
all
over
over
over
you
hear
me
i
am
fed
up
with
you
then
very
gently
and
solemnly
he
said
it
is
the
last
time
that
we
two
shall
speak
together
listen
félicie
before
there
is
a
tragedy
i
ought
to
warn
you
i
can
not
compel
you
to
love
me
but
i
do
not
intend
that
you
shall
love
another
for
the
last
time
i
advise
you
not
to
see
monsieur
de
ligny
again
i
shall
prevent
your
belonging
to
him
you
will
prevent
me
you
my
poor
dear
fellow
in
a
still
more
gentle
tone
he
replied
i
mean
it
i
shall
do
it
a
man
can
get
what
he
wants
only
he
must
pay
the
price
chapter
v
returning
home
félicie
succumbed
to
a
fit
of
tears
she
saw
chevalier
once
more
imploring
her
in
a
despairing
voice
with
the
look
of
a
poor
man
she
had
heard
that
voice
and
seen
that
expression
when
passing
tramps
worn
out
with
fatigue
on
the
high
road
when
her
mother
fearing
that
her
lungs
were
affected
had
taken
her
to
spend
the
winter
at
antibes
with
a
wealthy
aunt
she
despised
chevalier
for
his
gentleness
and
tranquil
manner
but
the
recollection
of
that
face
and
that
voice
disturbed
her
she
could
not
eat
she
felt
as
if
she
were
suffocating
in
the
evening
she
was
attacked
by
such
an
excruciating
internal
pain
that
she
thought
she
must
be
dying
she
thought
this
feeling
of
prostration
was
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
two
days
since
she
had
seen
robert
it
was
only
nine
she
hoped
that
she
might
find
him
still
at
home
and
put
on
her
hat
mamma
i
have
to
go
to
the
theatre
this
evening
i
am
off
out
of
consideration
for
her
mother
she
was
in
the
habit
of
making
such
veiled
explanations
go
my
child
but
do
come
home
too
late
ligny
lived
with
his
parents
he
had
on
the
top
floor
of
the
charming
house
in
the
rue
vernet
a
small
bachelor
flat
lit
by
round
windows
which
he
called
his
félicie
sent
word
by
the
that
a
lady
was
waiting
for
him
in
a
carriage
ligny
did
not
care
for
women
to
look
him
up
too
often
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
his
father
who
was
in
the
diplomatic
service
and
deeply
engrossed
in
the
foreign
interests
of
the
country
remained
in
an
incredible
state
of
ignorance
as
to
what
went
on
in
his
own
house
but
madame
de
ligny
was
determined
that
the
decencies
of
life
should
be
observed
in
her
home
and
her
son
was
careful
to
satisfy
her
requirements
in
the
matter
of
outward
appearances
since
they
never
probed
to
the
bottom
of
things
she
left
him
perfectly
free
to
love
where
he
would
and
only
rarely
in
serious
and
expansive
moments
did
she
hint
that
it
was
to
the
advantage
of
young
men
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
women
of
their
own
class
hence
it
was
that
robert
had
always
dissuaded
félicie
from
coming
to
him
in
the
rue
vernet
he
had
rented
in
the
boulevard
de
villiers
a
small
house
where
they
could
meet
in
absolute
freedom
but
on
the
present
occasion
after
two
days
without
seeing
her
he
was
greatly
pleased
by
her
unexpected
visit
and
he
came
down
immediately
leaning
back
in
the
cab
they
drove
through
the
darkness
and
the
snow
at
the
quiet
pace
of
their
aged
hack
through
the
streets
and
boulevards
while
the
darkness
of
the
night
cloaked
their
at
her
door
having
seen
her
home
he
said
till
yes
boulevard
de
villiers
come
early
she
was
leaning
on
him
preparatory
to
stepping
down
from
the
cab
suddenly
she
started
back
there
there
among
the
trees
he
has
seen
us
he
was
watching
us
who
then
a
man
some
one
i
do
know
she
had
just
recognized
chevalier
she
stepped
out
rang
the
bell
and
nestling
in
robert
fur
coat
waited
trembling
for
the
door
to
open
when
it
was
opened
she
detained
him
robert
see
me
upstairs
i
am
frightened
not
without
some
impatience
he
followed
her
up
the
stairs
chevalier
had
waited
for
félicie
in
the
little
before
the
armour
which
she
had
worn
as
jeanne
together
with
madame
nanteuil
until
one
in
the
morning
he
had
left
at
that
hour
and
had
watched
for
her
on
the
pavement
and
on
seeing
the
cab
stop
in
front
of
the
door
he
had
concealed
himself
behind
a
tree
he
knew
very
well
that
she
would
return
with
ligny
but
when
he
saw
them
together
it
was
as
if
the
earth
had
yawned
beneath
him
and
so
that
he
should
not
fall
to
the
ground
he
had
clutched
the
trunk
of
the
tree
he
remained
until
ligny
had
emerged
from
the
house
he
watched
him
as
wrapped
in
his
fur
coat
he
got
into
the
cab
took
a
couple
of
steps
as
if
to
spring
on
him
stopped
short
and
then
with
long
strides
went
down
the
boulevard
he
went
his
way
driven
by
the
rain
and
wind
feeling
too
hot
he
doffed
his
felt
hat
and
derived
a
certain
pleasure
from
the
sense
of
the
icy
drops
of
water
on
his
forehead
he
was
vaguely
conscious
that
houses
trees
walls
and
lights
went
past
him
indefinitely
he
wandered
on
dreaming
he
found
himself
without
knowing
how
he
had
got
there
on
a
bridge
which
he
hardly
knew
across
it
stood
the
colossal
statue
of
a
woman
his
mind
was
now
at
rest
he
had
formed
a
resolution
it
was
an
old
idea
which
he
had
now
driven
into
his
brain
like
a
nail
which
pierced
it
through
and
through
he
no
longer
examined
it
he
calculated
coldly
the
means
of
carrying
out
the
thing
he
had
determined
to
do
he
walked
straight
ahead
at
random
absorbed
in
thought
and
as
calm
as
a
mathematician
on
the
pont
des
arts
he
became
aware
that
a
dog
was
following
him
he
was
a
big
farm
dog
with
eyes
of
different
colours
which
were
full
of
gentleness
and
an
expression
of
infinite
distress
chevalier
spoke
to
him
you
no
collar
you
are
not
happy
poor
fellow
i
ca
do
anything
for
you
by
four
in
the
morning
he
found
himself
in
the
avenue
de
on
seeing
the
houses
of
the
boulevard
he
experienced
a
painful
impression
and
abruptly
turned
back
toward
the
observatory
the
dog
had
vanished
near
the
monument
of
the
lion
of
belfort
chevalier
stopped
in
front
of
a
deep
trench
which
cut
the
road
in
two
against
the
bank
of
excavated
earth
under
a
tarpaulin
supported
by
four
stakes
an
old
man
was
keeping
vigil
before
a
brazier
the
lappets
of
his
cap
were
down
over
his
ears
his
huge
nose
was
a
flaming
red
he
raised
his
head
his
eyes
which
were
watering
seemed
wholly
white
without
pupils
each
set
in
a
ring
of
fire
and
tears
he
was
stuffing
into
the
bowl
of
his
cutty
a
few
scraps
of
canteen
tobacco
mixed
with
which
did
not
fill
half
the
bowl
of
his
little
pipe
will
you
have
some
tobacco
old
fellow
asked
chevalier
offering
him
his
pouch
the
man
answer
was
slow
in
coming
his
understanding
was
not
quick
and
courtesies
astonished
him
finally
he
opened
a
mouth
which
was
quite
black
and
said
i
wo
say
no
to
that
he
half
rose
from
his
seat
one
of
his
feet
was
shod
in
an
old
slipper
the
other
was
swathed
in
rags
slowly
with
hands
numb
with
the
cold
he
stuffed
his
pipe
it
was
snowing
a
snow
that
melted
as
it
fell
you
will
excuse
me
said
chevalier
and
he
slipped
under
the
tarpaulin
and
seated
himself
beside
the
old
man
from
time
to
time
they
exchanged
a
remark
rotten
weather
it
what
we
expect
at
this
season
winter
hard
summer
better
so
you
look
after
the
job
at
night
old
fellow
the
old
man
answered
readily
when
questioned
before
he
spoke
his
throat
emitted
a
long
very
gentle
murmur
i
do
one
thing
one
day
another
thing
another
odd
jobs
see
you
are
not
a
parisian
no
i
was
born
in
la
creuse
i
used
to
work
as
a
navvy
in
the
vosges
i
left
there
the
year
the
prussians
and
other
foreigners
came
there
were
thousands
of
them
ca
understand
where
they
all
came
from
maybe
you
heard
of
the
war
of
the
prussians
young
man
he
remained
silent
for
a
long
spell
and
then
resumed
so
you
are
out
on
a
spree
my
lad
you
do
feel
like
going
back
to
the
works
yet
i
am
an
actor
replied
chevalier
the
old
man
who
did
not
understand
inquired
where
is
it
your
works
chevalier
was
anxious
to
rouse
the
old
man
admiration
i
play
comedy
parts
in
a
big
theatre
he
said
i
am
one
of
the
principal
actors
at
the
odéon
you
know
the
odéon
the
watchman
shook
his
head
no
he
did
not
know
the
odéon
after
a
prolonged
silence
he
once
more
opened
the
black
cavern
of
his
mouth
and
so
young
man
you
are
on
the
loose
you
do
want
to
go
back
to
the
works
eh
chevalier
replied
read
the
paper
the
day
after
you
will
see
my
name
in
it
the
old
man
tried
to
discover
a
meaning
in
these
words
but
it
was
too
difficult
he
gave
it
up
and
reverted
to
his
familiar
train
of
thought
when
once
one
off
on
the
loose
it
is
sometimes
for
weeks
and
months
at
daybreak
chevalier
resumed
his
wanderings
the
sky
was
milky
heavy
wheels
were
breaking
the
silence
of
the
paved
roads
voices
here
and
there
rang
through
the
keen
air
the
snow
was
no
longer
falling
he
walked
on
at
haphazard
the
spectacle
of
the
city
reviving
life
made
him
feel
almost
cheerful
on
the
pont
des
arts
he
stood
for
a
long
time
watching
the
seine
flow
by
after
which
he
continued
on
his
way
on
the
place
du
havre
he
saw
an
open
café
a
faint
streak
of
dawn
was
reddening
the
front
windows
the
waiters
were
sanding
the
brick
pavement
and
setting
out
the
tables
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
waiter
an
absinthe
chapter
vi
in
the
cab
beyond
the
fortifications
which
were
skirted
by
the
deserted
boulevard
félicie
and
robert
held
one
another
in
a
close
embrace
do
you
love
your
own
félicie
tell
me
does
it
flatter
your
vanity
to
possess
a
little
woman
who
makes
people
cheer
and
clap
her
who
is
written
about
in
the
newspapers
mamma
pastes
all
my
notices
in
her
album
the
album
is
full
already
he
replied
that
he
had
not
waited
for
her
to
succeed
before
discovering
how
charming
she
was
and
in
fact
their
liaison
had
begun
when
she
was
making
an
obscure
first
appearance
at
the
odéon
in
a
revival
which
had
fallen
flat
when
you
told
me
that
you
wanted
me
i
did
keep
you
waiting
did
i
we
did
take
long
about
that
was
i
right
you
are
too
sensible
to
think
badly
of
me
because
i
did
keep
things
dragging
along
when
i
saw
you
for
the
first
time
i
felt
that
i
was
to
be
yours
so
it
worth
while
delaying
i
do
regret
it
do
you
the
cab
stopped
at
a
short
distance
from
the
fortifications
in
front
of
a
garden
railing
this
railing
which
had
not
been
painted
for
a
long
time
stood
on
a
wall
faced
with
pebbles
low
and
broad
enough
to
permit
of
children
perching
themselves
on
it
it
was
screened
up
by
a
sheet
of
iron
with
a
toothed
edge
and
its
rusty
spikes
did
not
rise
more
than
ten
feet
above
the
ground
in
the
centre
between
two
pillars
of
masonry
surmounted
by
vases
the
railing
formed
a
gate
opening
in
the
middle
filled
in
across
its
lower
part
and
furnished
on
the
inside
with
slatted
shutters
they
alighted
from
the
cab
the
trees
of
the
boulevard
in
four
straight
lines
lifted
their
frail
skeletons
in
the
fog
they
heard
through
the
wide
silence
the
diminishing
rattle
of
their
cab
on
its
way
back
to
the
barrier
and
the
trotting
of
a
horse
coming
from
paris
how
dismal
the
country
is
she
said
with
a
shiver
but
my
darling
the
boulevard
de
villiers
is
not
the
country
he
could
not
open
the
gate
and
the
lock
creaked
irritated
by
the
sound
she
said
open
it
do
the
noise
is
getting
on
my
nerves
she
noticed
that
the
cab
which
had
come
from
paris
had
stopped
near
their
house
at
about
the
tenth
tree
from
where
she
stood
she
looked
at
the
thin
steaming
horse
and
the
shabby
driver
and
asked
what
is
that
carriage
it
a
cab
my
pet
why
does
it
stop
here
it
has
not
stopped
here
it
stopping
in
front
of
the
next
house
there
is
no
next
house
there
only
a
vacant
lot
well
then
it
has
stopped
in
front
of
a
vacant
lot
what
more
can
i
tell
you
i
do
see
anyone
getting
out
of
it
the
driver
is
perhaps
waiting
for
a
fare
what
in
front
of
a
vacant
lot
probably
my
dear
this
lock
has
got
rusty
she
crept
along
hiding
herself
behind
the
trees
toward
the
spot
where
the
cab
had
stopped
and
then
returned
to
ligny
who
had
succeeded
in
unlocking
the
gate
robert
the
blinds
of
the
cab
are
down
well
then
there
a
loving
couple
inside
do
you
think
there
something
queer
about
that
cab
it
is
not
a
thing
of
beauty
but
all
cabs
are
ugly
come
in
is
somebody
following
us
whom
do
you
expect
to
follow
us
i
do
know
one
of
your
women
friends
but
she
was
not
saying
what
was
in
her
thoughts
do
come
in
my
darling
when
she
had
entered
the
garden
she
said
be
sure
to
close
the
gate
properly
robert
before
them
stretched
a
small
oval
behind
it
stood
the
house
with
its
flight
of
three
steps
sheltered
by
a
zinc
portico
its
six
windows
and
its
slate
roof
ligny
had
rented
it
for
a
year
from
an
old
merchant
clerk
who
had
wearied
of
it
because
nocturnal
prowlers
used
to
steal
his
fowls
and
rabbits
on
either
side
of
the
a
gravel
path
led
to
the
steps
they
took
the
path
on
the
right
the
gravel
creaked
beneath
their
feet
madame
simonneau
has
forgotten
to
close
the
shutters
again
said
ligny
madame
simonneau
was
a
woman
from
neuilly
who
came
every
morning
to
clean
up
a
large
leaning
to
one
side
and
to
all
appearance
dead
stretched
one
of
its
round
black
branches
as
far
as
the
portico
i
do
quite
like
that
tree
said
félicie
its
branches
are
like
great
snakes
one
of
them
goes
almost
into
our
room
they
went
up
the
three
front
steps
and
while
he
was
looking
through
his
bunch
of
keys
for
the
key
of
the
front
door
she
rested
her
head
on
his
shoulder
félicie
when
unveiling
her
beauty
displayed
a
serene
pride
which
made
her
adorable
she
revealed
such
a
quiet
satisfaction
in
her
nudity
that
her
chemise
when
it
fell
to
her
feet
made
the
onlooker
think
of
a
white
peacock
and
when
robert
saw
her
in
her
nakedness
bright
as
the
streams
or
stars
he
said
at
least
you
do
make
one
badger
you
its
curious
there
are
women
who
even
if
you
do
ask
them
for
anything
surrender
themselves
completely
go
just
as
far
as
it
possible
to
go
yet
all
the
time
they
wo
let
you
see
so
much
as
a
of
skin
why
asked
félicie
playing
with
the
airy
threads
of
her
hair
robert
de
ligny
had
experience
of
women
yet
he
did
not
realize
what
an
insidious
question
this
was
he
had
received
some
training
in
moral
science
and
in
replying
he
derived
inspiration
from
the
professors
whose
classes
he
had
attended
it
is
doubtless
a
matter
of
training
religious
principles
and
an
innate
feeling
which
survives
even
when
this
was
not
at
all
what
he
ought
to
have
replied
for
félicie
shrugging
her
shoulders
and
placing
her
hands
upon
her
smoothly
polished
hips
interrupted
him
sharply
well
you
are
simple
it
because
they
got
bad
figures
training
religion
it
makes
me
boil
to
hear
such
rubbish
have
i
been
brought
up
any
worse
than
other
women
have
i
less
religion
than
they
have
tell
me
robert
how
many
really
women
have
you
ever
seen
just
reckon
them
up
on
your
fingers
yes
there
are
heaps
of
women
who
show
their
shoulders
or
anything
take
fagette
she
wo
let
even
women
see
her
undress
when
she
puts
a
clean
chemise
on
she
holds
the
old
one
between
her
teeth
sure
enough
i
should
do
the
same
if
i
were
built
as
she
is
she
relapsed
into
silence
and
with
quiet
arrogance
slowly
ran
the
palms
of
her
hands
over
her
sides
and
her
loins
observing
proudly
and
the
best
of
it
is
that
there
not
too
much
of
me
anywhere
she
was
conscious
of
the
charm
imparted
to
her
beauty
by
the
graceful
slenderness
of
her
outlines
now
her
head
thrown
back
on
the
pillow
was
bathed
in
the
masses
of
her
golden
tresses
which
lay
streaming
in
all
directions
her
slender
body
slightly
raised
by
a
pillow
slipped
beneath
her
loins
lay
motionless
at
full
length
one
gleaming
leg
was
extended
along
the
edge
of
the
bed
ending
in
a
sharply
chiselled
foot
like
the
point
of
a
sword
the
light
from
the
great
fire
which
had
been
lit
in
the
fireplace
gilded
her
flesh
casting
palpitating
lights
and
shadows
over
her
motionless
body
clothing
it
in
mystery
and
splendour
while
her
outer
clothing
and
her
underlinen
lying
on
the
chairs
and
the
carpet
waited
like
a
docile
flock
she
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
resting
her
cheek
in
her
hand
you
are
the
first
really
you
are
i
am
not
lying
the
others
exist
he
felt
no
jealousy
in
respect
of
the
past
he
had
no
fear
of
comparisons
he
questioned
her
then
the
others
to
begin
with
there
were
only
two
my
professor
and
he
of
course
does
count
and
there
was
the
man
i
told
you
about
a
solid
sort
of
a
person
whom
my
mother
saddled
me
with
no
more
i
swear
it
and
chevalier
chevalier
he
good
gracious
no
you
would
have
had
me
look
at
him
and
the
solid
sort
of
person
found
by
your
mother
he
too
does
not
count
any
more
i
assure
you
that
with
you
i
am
another
woman
it
the
solemn
truth
that
you
are
the
first
to
possess
me
it
queer
all
the
same
directly
i
set
eyes
on
you
i
wanted
you
quite
suddenly
i
felt
i
must
have
you
i
felt
it
somehow
what
i
should
find
it
very
hard
to
say
oh
i
did
stop
to
think
with
your
conventional
stiff
frigid
manners
and
your
appearance
like
a
little
wolf
you
pleased
me
that
was
all
and
now
i
could
not
do
without
you
no
indeed
i
could
he
assured
her
that
on
her
surrender
he
had
been
deliciously
surprised
he
said
all
sorts
of
pretty
caressing
things
all
of
which
had
been
said
before
taking
his
head
in
her
hands
she
said
you
have
really
the
teeth
of
a
wolf
i
think
it
was
your
teeth
that
made
me
want
you
the
first
day
bite
me
he
pressed
her
to
his
bosom
and
felt
her
firm
supple
body
respond
to
his
embrace
suddenly
she
released
herself
do
you
hear
the
gravel
creaking
no
listen
i
can
hear
a
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
path
sitting
upright
her
body
bent
forward
she
strained
her
ears
he
was
disappointed
excited
irritated
and
perhaps
his
was
slightly
hurt
what
has
come
over
you
it
absurd
she
cried
very
sharply
do
hold
your
tongue
she
was
listening
intently
to
a
slight
sound
near
at
hand
as
of
breaking
branches
suddenly
she
leapt
from
the
bed
with
such
instinctive
agility
with
a
movement
so
like
the
rapid
spring
of
a
young
animal
that
ligny
although
by
no
means
of
a
literary
turn
of
mind
thought
of
the
cat
metamorphosed
into
a
woman
are
you
crazy
where
are
you
going
raising
a
corner
of
the
curtain
she
wiped
the
moisture
from
the
corner
of
a
pane
and
peered
out
through
the
window
she
saw
nothing
but
the
night
the
noise
had
ceased
altogether
during
this
time
ligny
lying
moodily
against
the
wall
was
grumbling
as
you
will
but
if
you
catch
a
cold
so
much
the
worse
for
you
she
glided
back
into
bed
at
first
he
remained
somewhat
resentful
but
she
wrapped
him
about
with
the
delicious
freshness
of
her
body
when
they
came
to
themselves
they
were
surprised
to
see
by
one
of
their
watches
that
it
was
seven
ligny
lit
the
lamp
a
paraffin
lamp
supported
on
a
column
with
a
container
inside
which
the
wick
was
curled
up
like
a
félicie
was
very
quick
in
dressing
herself
they
had
to
descend
one
floor
by
a
wooden
staircase
dark
and
narrow
he
went
ahead
carrying
the
lamp
and
halted
in
the
passage
you
go
out
darling
before
i
put
the
lamp
out
she
opened
the
door
and
immediately
recoiled
with
a
loud
shriek
she
had
seen
chevalier
standing
on
the
outer
steps
with
arms
extended
tall
black
erect
as
a
crucifix
his
hand
grasped
a
revolver
the
glint
of
the
weapon
was
not
perceptible
nevertheless
she
saw
it
quite
distinctly
what
the
matter
demanded
ligny
who
was
turning
down
the
wick
of
the
lamp
listen
but
do
come
near
me
cried
chevalier
in
a
loud
voice
i
forbid
you
to
belong
to
one
another
this
is
my
dying
wish
félicie
and
he
slipped
the
barrel
of
the
revolver
into
his
mouth
crouching
against
the
passage
wall
she
closed
her
eyes
when
she
reopened
them
chevalier
was
lying
on
his
side
across
the
doorway
his
eyes
were
wide
open
and
he
seemed
to
be
gazing
at
them
with
a
smile
a
thread
of
blood
was
trickling
from
his
mouth
over
the
flagstones
of
the
porch
a
convulsive
tremor
shook
his
arm
then
he
ceased
to
move
as
he
lay
there
huddled
up
he
seemed
smaller
than
usual
on
hearing
the
report
of
the
revolver
ligny
had
hurriedly
come
forward
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
he
raised
the
body
and
immediately
lowering
it
gently
to
the
ground
he
attempted
to
strike
matches
which
the
wind
promptly
extinguished
at
last
by
the
flare
of
one
of
the
matches
he
saw
that
the
bullet
had
carried
away
part
of
the
skull
that
the
meninges
were
laid
bare
over
an
area
as
large
as
the
palm
of
the
hand
this
area
was
grey
oozing
blood
and
very
irregular
in
shape
its
outlines
reminding
ligny
of
the
map
of
africa
he
was
conscious
of
a
sudden
feeling
of
respect
in
the
presence
of
this
dead
man
placing
his
hands
under
the
armpits
he
dragged
chevalier
with
the
minutest
precautions
into
the
room
at
the
side
leaving
him
there
he
hurried
through
the
house
in
quest
of
félicie
calling
to
her
he
found
her
in
the
bedroom
with
her
head
buried
under
the
of
the
unmade
bed
crying
mamma
mamma
and
repeating
prayers
do
stay
here
félicie
she
went
downstairs
with
him
but
on
reaching
the
hall
she
said
you
know
very
well
that
we
ca
go
out
that
way
he
showed
her
out
by
the
kitchen
door
chapter
vii
left
alone
in
the
silent
house
robert
de
ligny
relit
the
lamp
serious
and
even
somewhat
solemn
voices
were
beginning
to
speak
within
him
moulded
from
childhood
by
the
rules
of
moral
responsibility
he
now
experienced
a
sensation
of
painful
regret
akin
to
remorse
reflecting
that
he
had
caused
the
death
of
this
man
albeit
without
intending
it
or
knowing
it
he
did
not
feel
wholly
innocent
shreds
of
his
philosophic
and
religious
training
came
back
to
him
disturbing
his
conscience
the
phrases
of
moralists
and
preachers
learned
at
school
which
had
sunk
to
the
very
depths
of
his
memory
suddenly
rose
in
his
mind
its
inward
voices
repeated
them
to
him
they
said
quoting
some
old
religious
orator
when
we
abandon
ourselves
to
irregularities
of
conduct
even
to
those
regarded
as
least
culpable
in
the
opinion
of
the
world
we
render
ourselves
liable
to
commit
the
most
reprehensible
actions
we
perceive
from
the
most
frightful
examples
that
voluptuousness
leads
to
crime
these
maxims
upon
which
he
had
never
reflected
suddenly
assumed
for
him
a
precise
and
austere
meaning
he
thought
the
matter
over
seriously
but
since
his
mind
was
not
deeply
religious
and
since
he
was
incapable
of
cherishing
exaggerated
scruples
he
was
conscious
of
only
a
passable
degree
of
edification
which
was
steadily
diminishing
before
long
he
decided
that
such
scruples
were
out
of
place
and
that
they
could
not
possibly
apply
to
the
situation
when
we
abandon
ourselves
to
irregularities
of
conduct
even
to
those
regarded
as
least
culpable
in
the
opinion
of
the
world
we
perceive
from
the
most
frightful
examples
these
phrases
which
only
a
little
while
ago
had
reverberated
through
his
soul
like
a
peal
of
thunder
he
now
heard
in
the
snuffling
and
throaty
voices
of
the
professors
and
priests
who
had
taught
them
to
him
and
he
found
them
somewhat
ridiculous
by
a
natural
association
of
ideas
he
recalled
a
passage
from
an
ancient
roman
history
which
he
had
read
when
in
the
second
form
during
a
certain
course
of
study
and
which
had
impressed
itself
on
his
mind
a
few
lines
concerning
a
lady
who
was
convicted
of
adultery
and
accused
of
having
set
fire
to
rome
so
true
it
is
ran
the
historian
comment
that
a
person
who
violates
the
laws
of
chastity
is
capable
of
any
crime
he
smiled
inwardly
at
this
recollection
reflecting
that
the
moralists
after
all
had
queer
ideas
about
life
the
wick
which
was
charring
gave
an
insufficient
light
he
could
not
manage
to
snuff
it
and
it
was
giving
out
a
horrible
stench
of
paraffin
thinking
of
the
author
of
the
passage
relating
to
the
roman
lady
he
said
to
himself
sure
enough
it
was
a
queer
idea
that
he
got
hold
of
there
he
felt
reassured
as
to
his
innocence
his
slight
feeling
of
remorse
had
entirely
evaporated
and
he
was
unable
to
conceive
how
he
could
for
a
moment
have
believed
himself
responsible
for
chevalier
death
yet
the
affair
troubled
him
suddenly
he
thought
supposing
he
were
still
alive
a
while
ago
for
the
space
of
a
second
by
the
light
of
a
match
blown
out
as
soon
as
it
was
struck
he
had
seen
the
hole
in
the
actor
skull
but
what
if
he
had
seen
incorrectly
what
if
he
had
taken
a
mere
graze
of
the
skin
for
a
serious
lesion
of
the
brain
and
skull
does
a
man
retain
his
powers
of
judgment
in
the
first
moments
of
surprise
and
horror
a
wound
may
be
hideous
without
being
mortal
or
even
particularly
serious
it
had
certainly
seemed
to
him
that
the
man
was
dead
but
was
he
a
medical
man
able
to
judge
with
certainty
he
lost
all
patience
with
the
wick
which
was
still
charring
and
muttered
this
lamp
is
enough
to
poison
one
then
recalling
a
trick
of
speech
habitual
to
socrates
as
to
the
origin
of
which
he
was
ignorant
he
repeated
mentally
this
lamp
stinks
like
of
devils
instances
occurred
to
him
of
several
abortive
attempts
at
suicide
he
remembered
having
read
in
a
newspaper
that
a
married
man
after
killing
his
wife
had
like
chevalier
fired
his
revolver
into
his
mouth
but
had
only
succeeded
in
shattering
his
jaw
he
remembered
that
at
his
club
a
well
known
sportsman
after
a
card
scandal
tried
to
blow
out
his
brains
but
merely
shot
off
an
ear
these
instances
applied
to
chevalier
with
striking
exactitude
supposing
he
were
not
dead
he
wished
and
hoped
against
all
evidence
that
the
unfortunate
man
might
still
be
breathing
that
he
might
be
saved
he
thought
of
fetching
bandages
of
giving
first
aid
intending
to
the
man
lying
in
the
front
room
he
raised
the
lamp
which
was
still
emitting
an
insufficient
light
too
suddenly
and
so
extinguished
it
whereupon
surprised
by
the
sudden
darkness
he
lost
patience
and
exclaimed
confound
the
blasted
thing
while
lighting
it
again
he
flattered
himself
with
the
idea
that
chevalier
once
taken
to
hospital
would
regain
consciousness
and
would
live
and
seeing
him
already
on
his
feet
perched
on
his
long
legs
bawling
clearing
his
throat
sneering
his
desire
for
his
recovery
became
less
eager
he
was
even
beginning
to
cease
to
desire
it
to
regard
it
as
annoying
and
inconsiderate
he
asked
himself
anxiously
with
a
feeling
of
real
uneasiness
what
in
the
world
would
he
do
if
he
came
back
that
dismal
actor
fellow
would
he
return
to
the
odéon
would
he
stroll
through
its
corridors
displaying
his
great
scar
would
he
once
more
have
to
see
him
prowling
round
félicie
he
held
the
lighted
lamp
close
to
the
body
and
recognized
the
livid
bleeding
wound
the
irregular
outline
of
which
reminded
him
of
the
africa
of
his
schoolboy
maps
plainly
death
had
been
instantaneous
and
he
failed
to
understand
how
he
could
for
a
moment
have
doubted
it
he
left
the
house
and
proceeded
to
stride
up
and
down
in
the
garden
the
image
of
the
wound
was
flashing
before
his
eyes
like
the
impression
caused
by
too
bright
a
light
it
moved
away
from
him
increasing
in
size
against
the
black
sky
it
took
the
shape
of
a
pale
continent
whence
he
saw
swarms
of
distracted
little
blacks
pouring
forth
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
he
decided
that
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
fetch
madame
simonneau
who
lived
close
at
hand
in
the
boulevard
bineau
in
the
residential
part
of
the
café
he
closed
the
gate
carefully
and
went
in
search
of
the
housekeeper
once
on
the
boulevard
he
recovered
his
equanimity
he
felt
most
uncomfortable
about
the
accident
he
accepted
the
accomplished
fact
but
he
cavilled
at
fate
in
respect
of
the
circumstances
since
there
had
to
be
a
death
he
gave
his
consent
that
there
should
be
one
but
he
would
have
preferred
another
toward
this
one
he
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
disgust
and
repugnance
he
said
to
himself
vaguely
i
concede
a
suicide
but
what
is
the
good
of
a
ridiculous
and
declamatory
suicide
could
the
fellow
have
killed
himself
at
home
could
he
if
his
determination
was
irrevocable
have
carried
it
out
discreetly
with
proper
pride
that
is
what
a
gentleman
would
have
done
in
his
position
then
one
might
have
pitied
him
and
respected
his
memory
he
recalled
word
for
word
his
conversation
with
félicie
in
the
bedroom
an
hour
before
the
tragedy
he
asked
her
if
she
had
not
for
a
time
been
chevalier
mistress
he
had
asked
her
this
not
because
he
wanted
to
know
for
he
had
very
little
doubt
of
it
but
in
order
to
show
that
he
knew
it
and
she
had
replied
indignantly
chevalier
he
good
gracious
no
you
would
have
had
me
look
at
him
he
did
not
blame
her
for
having
lied
all
women
lie
he
rather
enjoyed
the
graceful
and
easy
manner
with
which
she
had
cast
the
fellow
out
of
her
past
but
he
was
vexed
with
her
for
having
given
herself
to
a
actor
chevalier
spoilt
félicie
for
him
why
did
she
take
lovers
of
that
type
was
she
wanting
in
taste
did
she
not
exercise
a
certain
selection
did
she
behave
like
a
woman
of
the
town
did
she
lack
a
certain
sense
of
niceness
which
warns
women
as
to
what
they
may
or
may
not
do
did
she
know
how
to
behave
well
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
happened
if
women
had
no
breeding
he
blamed
félicie
for
the
accident
that
had
occurred
and
was
relieved
of
a
heavy
incubus
madame
simonneau
was
not
at
home
he
inquired
her
whereabouts
of
the
waiters
in
the
café
the
grocer
assistants
the
girls
at
the
laundry
the
police
and
the
postman
at
last
following
the
direction
of
a
neighbour
he
found
her
poulticing
an
old
lady
for
she
was
a
nurse
her
face
was
purple
and
she
reeked
of
brandy
he
sent
her
to
watch
the
corpse
he
instructed
her
to
cover
it
with
a
sheet
and
to
hold
herself
at
the
disposal
of
the
commissary
and
the
doctor
who
would
come
for
the
particulars
she
replied
somewhat
nettled
that
she
knew
please
god
what
she
had
to
do
she
did
indeed
know
madame
simonneau
was
born
in
a
social
circle
which
is
obsequious
to
the
constituted
authorities
and
respects
the
dead
but
when
having
questioned
monsieur
de
ligny
she
learnt
that
he
had
dragged
the
body
into
the
front
room
she
could
not
conceal
from
him
that
such
behaviour
was
imprudent
and
might
expose
him
to
unpleasantness
you
ought
not
to
have
done
it
she
told
him
when
anyone
has
killed
himself
you
must
never
touch
him
before
the
police
come
ligny
thereupon
went
off
to
notify
the
commissary
the
first
excitement
having
passed
off
he
no
longer
felt
any
surprise
doubtless
because
events
which
considered
from
a
distance
would
seem
strange
when
they
take
place
before
us
appear
quite
natural
as
indeed
they
are
they
unfold
themselves
in
an
ordinary
fashion
falling
into
place
as
a
succession
of
petty
facts
and
eventually
losing
themselves
in
the
everyday
commonplace
of
life
his
mind
was
distracted
from
the
violent
death
of
an
unfortunate
by
the
very
circumstances
of
that
death
by
the
part
which
he
had
played
in
the
affair
and
the
occupation
which
it
had
imposed
upon
him
on
his
way
to
the
he
felt
as
calm
and
as
free
from
mental
care
as
though
he
had
been
on
his
way
to
the
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
to
decipher
despatches
at
nine
in
the
evening
the
police
commissary
entered
the
garden
with
his
secretary
and
a
policeman
the
municipal
physician
monsieur
hibry
arrived
simultaneously
already
thanks
to
the
industry
of
madame
simonneau
who
was
always
interested
in
matters
of
supply
the
house
exhaled
a
violent
smell
of
carbolic
and
was
blazing
with
the
candles
which
she
had
lit
madame
simonneau
was
bustling
to
and
fro
actuated
by
an
urgent
desire
to
procure
a
crucifix
and
a
bough
of
consecrated
for
the
dead
the
doctor
examined
the
corpse
by
the
light
of
a
candle
he
was
a
bulky
man
with
a
ruddy
complexion
he
breathed
noisily
he
had
just
dined
the
bullet
a
large
calibre
bullet
he
said
penetrated
by
way
of
the
palatal
vault
traversed
the
brain
and
finally
fractured
the
left
parietal
bone
carrying
away
a
portion
of
the
cerebral
substance
and
blowing
out
a
piece
of
the
skull
death
was
instantaneous
he
returned
the
candle
to
madame
simonneau
and
continued
splinters
of
the
skull
were
projected
to
a
certain
distance
they
will
probably
be
found
in
the
garden
i
should
conjecture
that
the
bullet
was
a
conical
bullet
would
have
caused
less
destruction
however
the
commissary
monsieur
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
long
grey
moustache
seemed
neither
to
see
nor
to
hear
a
dog
was
howling
outside
the
garden
gate
the
direction
of
the
wound
said
the
doctor
as
well
as
the
fingers
of
the
right
hand
which
are
still
contracted
are
more
than
ample
proof
of
suicide
he
lit
a
cigar
we
are
sufficiently
informed
remarked
the
commissary
i
regret
gentlemen
to
have
disturbed
you
said
robert
de
ligny
and
i
thank
you
for
the
courteous
manner
in
which
you
have
carried
out
your
official
duties
the
secretary
and
the
police
agent
madame
simonneau
showing
the
way
carried
the
body
up
to
the
first
floor
monsieur
was
biting
his
nails
and
looking
into
space
a
tragedy
of
jealousy
he
remarked
nothing
is
more
common
we
have
here
in
neuilly
a
steady
average
of
deaths
out
of
a
hundred
suicides
thirty
are
caused
by
gambling
the
others
are
due
to
disappointment
in
love
poverty
or
incurable
disease
chevalier
inquired
hibry
who
was
a
lover
of
the
theatre
chevalier
wait
a
minute
i
have
seen
him
i
saw
him
at
a
benefit
performance
at
the
variétés
of
course
he
recited
a
monologue
the
dog
howled
outside
the
garden
gate
you
can
not
imagine
resumed
the
commissary
the
disasters
caused
in
this
municipality
by
the
i
am
not
exaggerating
when
i
assert
that
at
least
thirty
per
cent
of
the
suicides
which
i
have
to
look
into
are
caused
by
gambling
everybody
gambles
here
every
hairdresser
shop
is
a
clandestine
betting
agency
no
later
than
last
week
a
concierge
in
the
avenue

was
found
hanging
from
a
tree
in
the
bois

disappear
but
a
man
of
position
an
official
whom
gambling
has
ruined
who
is
overwhelmed
by
clamorous
creditors
threatened
with
distraint
and
on
the
point
of
being
dragged
before
a
court
of
justice
can
not
disappear
what
is
to
become
of
him
i
have
it
exclaimed
the
physician
he
recited
duel
in
the
people
are
rather
tired
of
monologues
but
that
is
very
funny
you
remember
you
fight
with
the
sword
sir
pistol
sir
sabre
the
knife
sir
then
i
see
what
you
want
you
are
not
fastidious
what
you
want
is
a
duel
in
the
prairie
i
agree
we
will
replace
the
prairie
by
a
house
you
are
permitted
to
conceal
yourself
in
the
vegetation
chevalier
used
to
recite
duel
in
the
in
a
very
humorous
manner
he
amused
me
greatly
that
night
it
is
true
that
i
am
not
an
ungrateful
audience
i
worship
the
theatre
the
commissary
was
not
listening
he
was
following
up
his
own
train
of
thought
it
will
never
be
known
how
many
fortunes
and
lives
are
devoured
each
year
by
the
gambling
never
releases
its
victims
when
it
has
despoiled
them
of
everything
it
still
remains
their
only
hope
what
else
indeed
will
permit
them
to
hope
he
ceased
straining
his
ear
to
catch
the
distant
cry
of
a
newsvendor
and
rushed
out
into
the
avenue
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitive
yelping
shadow
hailed
him
and
snatched
from
him
a
sporting
paper
which
he
spread
out
under
the
light
of
a
scanning
its
pages
for
certain
names
of
horses
with
haggard
eyes
trembling
hands
dumbfounded
crushed
he
dropped
the
sheet
his
horse
had
not
won
and
hibry
observing
him
from
a
distance
reflected
that
some
day
in
his
capacity
of
physician
to
the
dead
he
might
well
be
called
upon
to
certify
the
suicide
of
his
commissary
of
police
and
he
made
up
his
mind
in
advance
to
conclude
as
far
as
possible
that
his
death
was
due
to
accidental
causes
suddenly
he
seized
his
umbrella
i
must
be
off
he
said
i
have
been
given
a
seat
for
the
it
would
be
a
pity
to
waste
it
before
leaving
the
house
ligny
asked
madame
simonneau
where
have
you
put
him
in
the
bed
replied
madame
simonneau
it
was
more
decent
he
made
no
objection
and
raising
his
eyes
to
the
front
of
the
house
he
saw
at
the
windows
of
the
bedroom
through
the
muslin
curtains
the
light
of
the
two
candles
which
the
housekeeper
had
placed
on
the
bedside
table
perhaps
he
said
one
might
get
a
nun
to
watch
by
him
it
not
necessary
replied
madame
simonneau
who
had
invited
some
neighbours
of
her
own
sex
and
had
ordered
her
wine
and
meat
it
not
necessary
i
will
watch
by
him
myself
ligny
did
not
press
the
point
the
dog
was
still
howling
outside
the
gate
returning
on
foot
to
the
barrier
he
noticed
over
paris
a
reddish
glow
which
filled
the
whole
sky
above
the
the
factory
chimneys
rose
grotesque
and
black
against
this
fiery
mist
seeming
to
look
down
with
a
ridiculous
familiarity
upon
the
mysterious
conflagration
of
a
world
the
few
whom
he
met
on
the
boulevard
strolled
along
quietly
without
raising
their
heads
although
he
knew
that
when
cities
are
wrapped
in
night
the
moist
atmosphere
often
reflects
the
lights
becoming
tinged
with
this
uniform
glow
which
shines
without
a
flicker
he
fancied
that
he
was
looking
at
the
reflection
of
a
vast
fire
he
accepted
without
reflection
the
idea
that
paris
was
sinking
into
the
abyss
of
a
prodigious
conflagration
he
found
it
natural
that
the
private
catastrophe
in
which
he
had
become
involved
should
be
merged
into
a
public
disaster
and
that
this
same
night
should
be
for
a
whole
population
as
for
him
a
night
of
sinister
happenings
being
extremely
hungry
he
took
a
cab
at
the
barrier
and
had
himself
driven
to
a
restaurant
in
the
rue
royale
in
the
bright
warm
room
he
was
conscious
of
a
sense
of
after
ordering
his
meal
he
opened
an
evening
newspaper
and
saw
in
the
parliamentary
report
that
his
minister
had
delivered
a
speech
on
reading
it
he
smothered
a
slight
laugh
he
remembered
certain
stories
told
at
the
quai
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
was
enamoured
of
madame
de
neuilles
an
elderly
lady
with
a
lurid
past
whom
public
rumour
had
raised
to
the
status
of
adventuress
and
spy
he
was
wont
it
was
whispered
to
try
on
her
the
speeches
which
he
was
to
deliver
in
the
chamber
ligny
who
had
formerly
been
to
a
certain
small
extent
the
lover
of
madame
de
neuilles
pictured
to
himself
the
statesman
in
his
shirt
reciting
to
his
the
following
statement
of
principles
far
be
it
from
me
to
disregard
the
legitimate
susceptibilities
of
the
national
sentiment
resolutely
pacific
but
jealous
of
france
honour
the
government
will
etc
this
vision
put
him
in
a
merry
mood
he
turned
the
page
and
read
at
the
odéon

performance
in
this

at
one
on
the
following
day
was
in
rehearsal
for
the
first
time
in
the
of
the
theatre
a
dismal
light
spread
like
a
pall
over
the
grey
stones
of
the
roof
the
galleries
and
the
columns
in
the
depressing
majesty
of
this
pallid
architecture
beneath
the
statue
of
racine
the
leading
actors
were
reading
before
pradel
the
manager
of
the
house
their
parts
which
they
did
not
yet
know
romilly
the
stage
manager
and
constantine
marc
the
author
of
the
piece
were
all
three
seated
on
a
red
velvet
sofa
while
from
a
bench
set
back
between
two
columns
was
exhaled
the
vigilant
hatred
and
whispered
jealousy
of
the
actresses
left
out
of
the
cast
the
lover
paul
delage
was
with
difficulty
deciphering
a
speech
recognize
the
château
with
its
brick
walls
its
slated
roof
the
park
where
i
have
so
often
entwined
her
initials
and
mine
on
the
bark
of
the
trees
the
pond
whose
slumbering
waters
fagette
rebuked
him
aimeri
lest
the
château
know
you
not
again
lest
the
park
forget
your
name
lest
the
pond
murmur
who
is
this
stranger
but
she
had
a
cold
and
was
reading
from
a
manuscript

full
of
mistakes

nanteuil
came
forward
muffled
up
in
her
furs
her
little
bag
and
her
part
in
her
hand
white
as
a
sheet
her
eyes
sunken
her
legs
nerveless
when
fully
awake
she
had
seen
the
dead
man
enter
her
bedroom
she
inquired
where
do
i
make
my
entrance
from
from
the
right
all
right
and
she
read
i
was
so
happy
when
i
awoke
this
morning
i
do
not
know
why
it
was
can
you
perhaps
tell
me
delage
read
his
reply
may
be
cécile
that
it
was
due
to
a
special
dispensation
of
providence
or
of
fate
the
god
who
loves
you
suffers
you
to
smile
in
the
hour
of
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of
teeth

constantin

no
longer
recognized
his
handiwork
he
could
no
longer
even
hear
the
sound
of
his
beloved
phrases
which
he
had
so
often
repeated
to
himself
in
the
vivarais
woods
dumbfounded
and
dazed
he
held
his
peace
nanteuil
tripped
daintily
across
the
stage
and
resumed
reading
her
part
will
perhaps
think
me
very
foolish
aimeri
in
the
convent
where
i
was
brought
up
i
often
used
to
envy
the
fate
of
the
victims
delage
took
up
his
cue
but
he
had
overlooked
a
page
of
the
manuscript
weather
is
magnificent
already
the
guests
are
strolling
about
the
garden
it
became
necessary
to
start
all
over
again
days
do
you
say
aimeri
and
so
they
proceeded
without
troubling
to
understand
but
careful
to
regulate
their
movements
as
if
studying
the
figures
of
a
dance
in
the
interests
of
the
play
we
shall
have
to
make
some
cuts
said
pradel
to
the
dismayed
author
and
delage
continued
not
blame
me
cécile
i
felt
for
you
a
friendship
dating
from
childhood
one
of
those
fraternal
friendships
which
impart
to
the
love
which
springs
from
them
a
disquieting
appearance
of
incest
incest
shouted
pradel
you
can
not
let
the
word
remain
monsieur
constantin
marc
the
public
has
susceptibilities
of
which
you
have
no
idea
moreover
the
order
of
the
two
speeches
which
follow
must
be
transposed
the
optics
of
the
stage
require
it
the
rehearsal
was
interrupted
romilly
caught
sight
of
durville
who
in
a
recess
was
telling
racy
stories
durville
you
can
go
the
second
act
will
not
be
rehearsed
before
leaving
the
old
actor
went
up
to
nanteuil
to
press
her
hand
judging
that
this
was
the
moment
to
assure
her
of
his
sympathy
he
summoned
up
the
tears
to
his
eyes
as
anyone
condoling
with
her
would
have
done
in
his
place
but
he
did
it
admirably
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
swam
in
their
orbits
like
the
moon
amid
clouds
the
corners
of
his
lips
were
turned
down
in
two
deep
furrows
which
prolonged
them
to
the
bottom
of
his
chin
he
appeared
to
be
genuinely
afflicted
my
poor
darling
he
sighed
i
pity
you
i
do
indeed
to
see
one
for
whom
one
has
experienced
a
feeling
with
whom
one
has
lived
in
intimacy
to
see
him
carried
off
at
a
blow
a
tragic
blow
is
hard
is
terrible
and
he
extended
his
compassionate
hands
nanteuil
completely
unnerved
and
crushing
her
tiny
handkerchief
and
her
part
in
her
hands
turned
her
back
upon
him
and
hissed
between
her
teeth
old
idiot
fagette
passed
her
arm
round
her
waist
and
led
her
gently
aside
to
the
foot
of
racine
statue
where
she
whispered
into
her
ear
listen
to
me
my
dear
this
affair
must
be
completely
hushed
up
everybody
is
talking
about
it
if
you
let
people
talk
they
will
brand
you
for
life
as
chevalier
widow
then
being
something
of
a
talker
she
added
i
know
you
i
am
your
best
friend
i
know
your
value
but
beware
félicie
women
are
held
at
their
own
valuation
every
one
of
fagette
shafts
told
nanteuil
with
fiery
cheeks
held
back
her
tears
too
young
to
possess
or
even
to
desire
the
prudence
which
comes
to
celebrated
actresses
when
of
an
age
to
graduate
as
women
of
the
world
of
fashion
she
was
full
of
and
since
she
had
known
what
it
was
to
love
another
she
was
eager
to
efface
everything
unfashionable
from
her
past
she
felt
that
chevalier
in
killing
himself
for
her
sake
had
behaved
towards
her
publicly
with
a
familiarity
which
made
her
ridiculous
still
unaware
that
all
things
fall
into
oblivion
and
are
lost
in
the
swift
current
of
our
days
that
all
our
actions
flow
like
the
waters
of
a
river
between
banks
that
have
no
memory
she
pondered
irritated
and
dejected
at
the
feet
of
jean
racine
who
understood
her
grief
just
look
at
her
said
madame
to
young
delage
she
wants
to
cry
i
understand
her
a
man
killed
himself
for
me
i
was
greatly
upset
by
it
he
was
a
count
well
begin
again
shouted
pradel
come
now
mademoiselle
nanteuil
your
cue
whereupon
nanteuil
i
was
so
happy
when
i
awoke
this
morning
suddenly
madame
doulce
appeared
ponderous
and
mournful
she
let
fall
the
following
words
i
have
very
sad
news
the
parish
priest
will
not
allow
him
to
enter
his
church
as
chevalier
had
no
relations
left
other
than
a
sister
a
at
pantin
madame
doulce
had
undertaken
to
make
arrangements
for
the
funeral
at
the
expense
of
the
members
of
the
company
they
gathered
round
her
she
continued
the
church
rejects
him
as
though
he
were
accurst
that
dreadful
why
asked
romilly
madame
doulce
replied
in
a
very
low
tone
and
as
if
reluctantly
because
he
committed
suicide
we
must
see
to
this
said
pradel
romilly
displayed
an
eager
desire
to
be
of
service
the
curé
knows
me
he
said
he
is
a
very
decent
fellow
i
just
run
over
to
and
i
be
greatly
surprised
if
madame
doulce
shook
her
head
sadly
all
is
useless
all
the
same
we
must
have
a
religious
service
said
romilly
with
all
the
authority
of
a
quite
so
said
madame
doulce
madame
deeply
exercised
in
her
mind
was
of
opinion
that
the
priests
could
be
compelled
to
say
a
mass
let
us
keep
cool
said
pradel
caressing
his
venerable
beard
under
louis
viii
the
people
broke
in
the
doors
of
which
had
been
closed
to
the
coffin
of
mademoiselle
raucourt
we
live
in
other
times
and
under
different
circumstances
we
must
have
recourse
to
gentler
methods
constantin
marc
seeing
to
his
great
regret
that
his
play
was
abandoned
had
likewise
approached
madame
doulce
he
inquired
of
her
why
should
you
want
chevalier
to
be
blessed
by
the
church
personally
i
am
a
catholic
with
me
it
is
not
a
faith
it
is
a
system
and
i
look
upon
it
as
a
duty
to
participate
in
all
the
external
practices
of
worship
i
am
on
the
side
of
all
authorities
i
am
for
the
judge
the
soldier
the
priest
i
can
not
therefore
be
suspected
of
favouring
civil
burials
but
i
hardly
understand
why
you
persist
in
offering
the
curé
of
a
dead
body
which
he
repudiates
now
why
do
you
want
this
unfortunate
chevalier
to
go
to
church
why
replied
madame
doulce
for
the
salvation
of
his
soul
and
because
it
is
more
seemly
what
would
be
seemly
replied
constantin
marc
would
be
to
obey
the
laws
of
the
church
which
excommunicates
suicides
monsieur
constantin
marc
have
you
read
soirées
de
inquired
pradel
who
was
an
ardent
collector
of
old
books
and
a
great
reader
what
you
have
not
read
soirées
de
by
monsieur
de
fongeray
you
have
missed
something
it
is
a
curious
book
which
can
still
be
met
with
sometimes
on
the
quays
it
is
adorned
by
a
lithograph
of
henry
monnier
which
is
i
do
know
why
a
caricature
of
stendhal
fongeray
is
the
pseudonym
of
two
liberals
of
the
restoration
dittmer
and
cavé
the
work
consists
of
comedies
and
dramas
which
can
not
be
acted
but
which
contain
some
most
interesting
scenes
representing
manners
and
customs
you
will
read
in
it
how
in
the
reign
of
charles
x
a
vicar
of
one
of
the
paris
churches
the
abbé
mouchaud
would
refuse
burial
to
a
pious
lady
and
would
at
all
costs
grant
it
to
an
atheist
madame
was
religious
but
she
held
some
national
property
at
her
death
she
received
the
ministrations
of
a
jansenist
priest
for
this
reason
after
her
death
the
abbé
mouchaud
refused
to
receive
her
into
the
church
in
which
she
had
passed
her
life
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
parish
monsieur
dubourg
a
big
banker
was
good
enough
to
die
in
his
will
he
stipulated
that
he
should
be
borne
straight
to
the
cemetery
is
a
catholic
reflected
the
abbé
mouchaud
belongs
to
us
quickly
making
a
parcel
of
his
stole
and
surplice
he
rushed
off
to
the
dead
man
house
administered
extreme
unction
and
brought
him
into
his
church
well
replied
constantin
marc
that
vicar
was
an
excellent
politician
atheists
are
not
formidable
enemies
of
the
church
they
do
not
count
as
adversaries
they
can
not
raise
a
church
against
her
and
they
do
not
dream
of
doing
so
atheists
have
existed
at
all
times
among
the
heads
and
princes
of
the
church
and
many
of
them
have
rendered
signal
services
to
the
papacy
on
the
other
hand
whoever
does
not
submit
strictly
to
ecclesiastical
discipline
and
breaks
away
from
tradition
upon
a
single
point
whoever
sets
up
a
faith
against
the
faith
an
opinion
a
practices
against
the
accepted
opinion
and
the
common
practice
is
a
factor
of
disorder
a
menace
of
peril
and
must
be
extirpated
this
the
vicar
mouchaud
understood
he
should
have
been
made
a
cardinal
madame
doulce
who
had
been
clever
enough
not
to
tell
everything
in
a
breath
went
on
to
say
i
did
not
allow
myself
to
be
discomfited
by
the
opposition
of
monsieur
le
curé
i
begged
i
entreated
and
his
answer
was
owe
respectful
obedience
to
the
ordinary
go
to
the
archbishop
palace
i
will
do
as
monseigneur
bids
me
there
is
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
follow
this
advice
i
hurrying
off
to
the
archbishop
palace
let
us
get
to
work
said
pradel
romilly
called
to
nanteuil
nanteuil
come
nanteuil
begin
your
whole
scene
over
again
and
nanteuil
said
once
more
i
was
so
happy
when
i
awoke
this
morning
chapter
ix
the
prominence
given
by
the
press
to
the
suicide
of
the
boulevard
de
villiers
rendered
the
negotiations
between
the
stage
and
the
church
all
the
more
difficult
the
reporters
had
given
the
fullest
details
of
the
event
and
it
was
pointed
out
by
the
abbé
mirabelle
the
second
vicar
that
to
open
the
doors
of
the
parish
church
to
chevalier
as
matters
then
stood
was
to
proclaim
that
excommunicated
persons
were
entitled
to
the
prayers
of
the
church
but
for
that
matter
monsieur
mirabelle
himself
who
in
this
affair
displayed
great
wisdom
and
circumspection
paved
the
way
to
a
solution
you
must
fully
understand
he
observed
to
madame
doulce
that
the
opinion
of
the
newspapers
can
not
affect
our
decision
we
are
absolutely
indifferent
to
it
and
we
do
not
disturb
ourselves
in
the
slightest
degree
no
matter
what
fifty
public
sheets
may
say
about
the
unfortunate
young
fellow
whether
the
journalists
have
told
the
truth
or
distorted
it
is
their
affair
not
mine
i
do
not
know
and
i
do
not
wish
to
know
what
they
have
written
but
the
fact
of
the
suicide
is
notorious
you
can
not
dispute
it
it
would
now
be
advisable
to
investigate
closely
and
by
the
light
of
science
the
circumstances
in
which
the
deed
was
committed
do
not
be
surprised
by
my
thus
invoking
the
aid
of
science
science
has
no
better
friend
than
religion
now
medical
science
may
in
the
present
case
be
of
great
assistance
to
us
you
will
understand
in
a
moment
mother
church
ejects
the
suicide
from
her
bosom
only
when
his
act
is
an
act
of
despair
the
madmen
who
attempt
their
own
lives
are
not
those
who
have
lost
all
hope
and
the
church
does
not
deny
them
her
prayers
she
prays
for
all
who
are
unfortunate
now
if
it
could
be
proved
that
this
poor
boy
had
acted
under
the
influence
of
a
high
fever
or
of
a
mental
disorder
if
a
medical
man
were
in
a
position
to
certify
that
the
poor
fellow
was
not
in
possession
of
his
faculties
when
he
slew
himself
with
his
own
hand
there
would
be
no
obstacle
to
the
celebration
of
a
religious
service
having
hearkened
to
the
words
of
monsieur
mirabelle
madame
doulce
hastened
back
to
the
theatre
the
rehearsal
of
was
over
she
found
pradel
in
his
office
with
a
couple
of
young
actresses
one
of
whom
was
soliciting
an
engagement
the
other
leave
of
absence
he
refused
in
conformity
with
his
principle
never
to
grant
a
request
until
he
had
first
refused
it
in
this
way
he
bestowed
a
value
upon
his
most
trifling
concessions
his
glistening
eyes
and
his
patriarchal
beard
his
manner
at
once
amorous
and
paternal
gave
him
a
resemblance
to
lot
as
we
see
him
between
his
two
daughters
in
the
prints
of
the
old
masters
standing
on
the
table
was
an
amphora
of
gilt
pasteboard
which
fostered
this
illusion
it
ca
be
done
he
was
telling
each
of
them
it
really
ca
be
done
my
child
well
after
all
look
in
having
dismissed
them
he
inquired
as
he
signed
some
letters
well
madame
doulce
what
news
do
you
bring
constantin
marc
appearing
with
nanteuil
hastily
exclaimed
what
about
my
scenery
monsieur
pradel
thereupon
he
described
for
the
twentieth
time
the
landscape
upon
which
the
curtain
ought
to
rise
in
the
foreground
an
old
park
the
trunks
of
the
great
trees
on
the
north
side
are
green
with
moss
the
dampness
of
the
soil
must
be
felt
and
the
manager
replied
you
may
rest
assured
that
everything
that
can
be
done
will
be
done
and
that
it
will
be
most
appropriate
well
madame
doulce
what
news
there
is
a
glimmer
of
hope
she
replied
at
the
back
in
a
slight
mist
said
the
author
the
grey
stones
and
the
slate
roofs
of
the
quite
so
pray
be
seated
madame
doulce
you
have
my
attention
i
was
most
courteously
received
at
the
archbishop
palace
said
madame
doulce
monsieur
pradel
it
is
imperative
that
the
walls
of
the
abbaye
should
appear
inscrutable
of
great
thickness
and
yet
subtilized
by
the
mists
of
coming
night
a
sky
monsieur
mirabelle
resumed
madame
doulce
is
a
priest
of
the
highest
distinction
monsieur
marc
are
you
particularly
keen
on
your
sky
inquired
the
stage
manager
go
on
madame
doulce
go
on
i
am
listening
to
you
and
exquisitely
polite
he
made
a
delicate
allusion
to
the
indiscretions
of
the
newspapers
at
this
moment
monsieur
marchegeay
the
stage
manager
burst
into
the
room
his
green
eyes
were
glittering
and
his
red
moustache
was
dancing
like
a
flame
the
words
rolled
off
his
tongue
they
are
at
it
again
lydie
the
little
super
is
screaming
like
a
stoat
on
the
stairs
she
says
delage
tried
to
violate
her
it
at
least
the
tenth
time
in
a
month
that
she
has
come
out
with
that
story
this
is
an
infernal
nuisance
such
conduct
can
not
be
tolerated
in
a
house
like
this
said
pradel
you
have
to
fine
delage
pray
continue
madame
doulce
monsieur
mirabelle
explained
to
me
in
the
clearest
manner
that
suicide
is
an
act
of
despair
but
constantin
marc
was
inquiring
of
pradel
with
interest
whether
lydie
the
little
super
was
pretty
you
have
seen
her
in
nuit
du
she
plays
the
woman
of
the
people
who
in
the
plaine
de
grenelle
is
buying
wafers
of
madame
ravaud
a
very
pretty
girl
to
my
thinking
said
constantin
marc
undoubtedly
responded
pradel
but
she
would
be
still
prettier
if
her
ankles
were
like
stakes
and
constantin
marc
musingly
replied
and
delage
has
outraged
her
that
fellow
possesses
the
sense
of
love
love
is
a
simple
and
primitive
act
it
a
struggle
it
hatred
violence
is
necessary
to
it
love
by
mutual
consent
is
merely
a
tedious
obligation
and
he
cried
greatly
excited
delage
is
prodigious
do
get
yourself
into
a
fix
said
pradel
this
same
little
lydie
entices
my
actors
into
her
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
screams
out
that
she
is
being
outraged
in
order
to
get
out
of
them
it
her
lover
who
has
taught
her
the
trick
and
takes
the
coin
you
were
saying
madame
doulce
after
a
long
and
interesting
conversation
resumed
madame
doulce
monsieur
mirabelle
suggested
a
favourable
solution
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
in
order
to
remove
all
difficulties
it
would
be
sufficient
for
a
physician
to
certify
that
chevalier
was
not
in
full
possession
of
his
faculties
and
that
he
was
not
responsible
for
his
acts
but
observed
pradel
chevalier
was
insane
he
was
in
full
possession
of
his
faculties
it
not
for
us
to
say
replied
madame
doulce
what
do
we
know
about
it
no
said
nanteuil
he
was
not
in
full
possession
of
his
faculties
pradel
shrugged
his
shoulders
after
all
it
possible
insanity
and
reason
it
a
matter
of
appreciation
to
whom
could
we
apply
for
a
certificate
madame
doulce
and
pradel
called
to
mind
three
physicians
in
succession
but
they
were
unable
to
find
the
address
of
the
first
the
second
was
and
it
was
decided
that
the
third
was
dead
nanteuil
suggested
that
they
should
approach
trublet
that
an
idea
exclaimed
pradel
let
us
ask
a
certificate
of
socrates
what
friday
it
his
day
for
consultations
we
shall
find
him
at
home
trublet
lived
in
an
old
house
at
the
top
of
the
rue
de
seine
pradel
took
nanteuil
with
him
with
the
idea
that
socrates
would
refuse
nothing
to
a
pretty
woman
constantin
marc
who
could
not
live
when
in
paris
save
in
the
company
of
theatrical
folk
accompanied
them
the
chevalier
affair
was
beginning
to
amuse
him
he
found
it
theatrical
that
is
appropriate
to
theatrical
performers
although
the
hour
for
consultations
was
over
the
doctor
was
still
full
of
people
in
search
of
healing
trublet
dismissed
them
and
received
his
theatrical
friends
in
his
private
room
he
was
standing
in
front
of
a
table
encumbered
with
books
and
papers
an
adjustable
infirm
and
cynical
displayed
itself
by
the
window
the
director
of
the
odéon
set
forth
the
object
of
his
call
and
ended
by
saying
chevalier
funeral
service
can
not
be
celebrated
in
the
church
unless
you
certify
that
the
unfortunate
young
man
was
not
altogether
sane
trublet
declared
that
chevalier
might
very
well
do
without
a
religious
service
adrienne
lecouvreur
who
was
of
more
account
than
chevalier
did
without
one
mademoiselle
monime
had
no
mass
said
for
her
after
her
death
and
as
you
are
aware
she
was
denied
honour
of
rotting
in
a
nasty
cemetery
in
the
company
of
all
the
beggars
of
the
quarter
she
was
none
the
worse
off
for
that
you
are
not
ignorant
of
the
fact
socrates
replied
pradel
that
actors
and
actresses
are
the
most
religious
of
people
my
company
would
be
deeply
grieved
if
they
could
not
be
present
at
the
celebration
of
a
mass
for
their
colleague
they
have
already
secured
the
of
several
lyric
artists
and
the
music
will
be
very
fine
now
that
a
reason
said
trublet
i
do
not
gainsay
it
charles
monselet
who
was
a
witty
fellow
was
reflecting
only
a
few
hours
before
his
death
on
his
musical
mass
know
a
great
many
singers
at
the
opéra
he
said
shall
have
a
jésu
aux
but
as
on
this
occasion
the
archbishop
does
not
authorize
a
spiritual
concert
it
would
be
more
convenient
to
postpone
it
to
some
other
occasion
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
replied
the
director
i
have
no
religious
belief
but
i
consider
that
the
church
and
the
stage
are
two
great
social
powers
and
that
it
is
beneficial
that
they
should
be
friends
and
allies
for
my
own
part
i
never
lose
an
opportunity
of
sealing
the
alliance
this
coming
lent
i
shall
have
durville
read
one
of
bourdaloue
sermons
i
receive
a
state
subsidy
i
must
observe
the
concordat
moreover
whatever
people
may
say
catholicism
is
the
most
acceptable
form
of
religious
indifference
well
then
objected
constantin
marc
since
you
wish
to
show
deference
to
the
church
why
do
you
foist
upon
her
by
force
or
by
subterfuge
a
coffin
which
she
does
want
the
doctor
spoke
in
a
similar
strain
and
ended
by
saying
my
dear
pradel
do
you
have
anything
more
to
do
with
the
matter
whereupon
nanteuil
her
eyes
blazing
her
voice
sibilant
cried
he
must
go
to
church
doctor
sign
what
is
asked
of
you
write
that
he
was
not
in
possession
of
his
faculties
i
entreat
you
there
was
not
religion
alone
at
the
back
of
this
desire
blended
with
it
was
an
intimate
feeling
an
obscure
background
of
old
beliefs
of
which
she
herself
was
unaware
she
hoped
that
if
he
were
carried
into
the
church
and
sprinkled
with
holy
water
chevalier
would
be
appeased
would
become
one
of
the
peaceful
dead
and
would
no
longer
torment
her
she
feared
on
the
other
hand
that
if
he
were
deprived
of
benediction
and
prayers
he
would
perpetually
hover
about
her
accursed
and
maleficent
and
more
simply
still
in
her
dread
of
seeing
him
again
she
was
anxious
that
the
priests
should
take
good
care
to
bury
him
and
that
everybody
should
attend
the
funeral
so
that
he
should
be
all
the
more
thoroughly
buried
as
thoroughly
buried
in
short
as
it
was
possible
to
be
her
lips
trembled
and
she
wrung
her
hands
trublet
who
had
long
graduated
in
human
nature
watched
her
with
interest
he
understood
and
took
a
special
interest
in
the
female
of
the
human
machine
this
particular
specimen
filled
him
with
joy
his
face
beamed
with
delight
as
he
watched
her
do
be
uneasy
child
there
is
always
a
way
of
coming
to
an
understanding
with
the
church
what
you
are
asking
me
is
not
within
my
powers
i
am
a
lay
doctor
but
we
have
thank
god
religious
physicians
who
send
their
patients
to
the
ecclesiastical
waters
and
whose
special
function
is
to
attest
miraculous
cures
i
know
one
who
lives
in
this
part
of
the
town
i
give
you
his
address
go
and
see
him
the
bishop
will
refuse
him
nothing
he
will
arrange
the
matter
for
you
not
at
all
said
pradel
you
always
attended
poor
chevalier
it
is
for
you
to
give
a
certificate
romilly
agreed
of
course
doctor
you
are
the
physician
to
the
theatre
we
must
wash
our
dirty
linen
at
home
at
the
same
time
nanteuil
turned
upon
socrates
a
gaze
of
entreaty
but
objected
trublet
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
it
very
simple
pradel
replied
say
that
he
was
to
a
certain
extent
irresponsible
you
are
simply
asking
me
to
speak
like
a
police
surgeon
it
expecting
too
much
of
me
you
believe
then
doctor
that
chevalier
was
fully
and
entirely
morally
responsible
quite
the
contrary
i
am
of
opinion
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
responsible
for
his
actions
well
then
but
i
also
consider
that
in
this
respect
he
differed
in
nowise
from
you
myself
and
all
other
men
my
judicial
colleagues
distinguish
between
individual
responsibilities
they
have
procedures
by
which
they
recognize
full
responsibilities
and
those
which
lack
one
or
more
fractional
parts
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
moreover
that
in
order
to
get
a
poor
wretch
condemned
they
always
find
him
fully
responsible
may
we
not
therefore
consider
that
their
own
responsibility
is
full
like
the
moon
and
socrates
proceeded
to
unfold
before
the
astonished
stage
folk
a
comprehensive
theory
of
universal
determinism
he
went
back
to
the
origins
of
life
and
like
the
silenus
of
virgil
who
smeared
with
the
juice
of
mulberries
sang
to
the
shepherds
of
sicily
and
the
naiad
aglaia
of
the
origin
of
the
world
he
broke
out
into
a
flood
of
words
to
call
upon
a
poor
wretch
to
answer
for
his
actions
why
even
when
the
solar
system
was
still
no
more
than
a
pale
nebula
forming
in
the
ether
a
fragile
halo
whose
circumference
was
a
thousand
times
greater
than
the
orbit
of
neptune
we
had
all
of
us
for
ages
past
been
fully
conditioned
determined
and
irrevocably
destined
and
your
responsibility
my
dear
child
my
responsibility
chevalier
and
that
of
all
men
had
been
not
mitigated
but
abolished
beforehand
all
our
movements
the
result
of
previous
movements
of
matter
are
subject
to
the
laws
which
govern
the
cosmic
forces
and
the
human
mechanism
is
merely
a
particular
instance
of
the
universal
mechanism
pointing
to
a
locked
cupboard
he
proceeded
i
have
there
contained
in
bottles
that
which
would
transform
destroy
or
excite
to
frenzy
the
will
of
fifty
thousand
men
would
be
playing
the
game
objected
pradel
i
agree
it
would
be
playing
the
game
but
these
substances
are
not
essentially
laboratory
products
the
laboratory
combines
it
does
not
create
anything
these
substances
are
scattered
throughout
nature
in
their
free
state
they
surround
and
enter
into
us
they
determine
our
will
they
circumscribe
our
freedom
of
device
which
is
merely
the
illusion
engendered
within
us
by
the
ignorance
of
our
determinations
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
asked
pradel
taken
aback
i
mean
that
our
will
is
an
illusion
caused
by
our
ignorance
of
the
causes
which
compel
us
to
exert
our
will
that
which
wills
within
us
is
not
ourselves
but
myriads
of
cells
of
prodigious
activity
of
which
we
know
nothing
which
are
unaware
of
us
which
are
ignorant
of
one
another
but
which
nevertheless
constitute
us
by
means
of
their
restlessness
they
produce
innumerable
currents
which
we
call
our
passions
our
thoughts
our
joys
our
sufferings
our
desires
our
fears
and
our
will
we
believe
that
we
are
our
own
masters
while
a
mere
drop
of
alcohol
stimulates
and
then
benumbs
the
very
elements
by
which
we
feel
and
will
constantin
marc
interrupted
the
physician
excuse
me
since
you
are
speaking
of
the
action
of
alcohol
i
should
like
your
advice
on
the
subject
i
am
in
the
habit
of
drinking
a
small
glass
of
armagnac
brandy
after
each
meal
that
not
too
much
is
it
it
a
great
deal
too
much
alcohol
is
a
poison
if
you
have
a
bottle
of
brandy
at
home
fling
it
out
of
the
window
pradel
was
pondering
he
considered
that
in
suppressing
will
and
responsibility
in
all
human
things
socrates
was
doing
him
a
personal
injury
you
may
say
what
you
like
will
and
responsibility
are
not
illusions
they
are
tangible
and
powerful
realities
i
know
how
the
terms
of
my
contract
bind
me
and
i
impose
my
will
on
others
and
he
added
with
some
bitterness
i
believe
in
the
will
in
moral
responsibility
in
the
distinction
between
good
and
evil
doubtless
these
are
according
to
you
stupid
ideas
they
are
indeed
stupid
ideas
replied
the
physician
but
they
are
very
suitable
to
us
since
we
are
mere
animals
we
are
for
ever
forgetting
this
they
are
stupid
venerable
wholesome
ideas
men
have
felt
that
without
these
ideas
they
would
all
go
mad
they
had
only
the
choice
between
stupidity
and
madness
very
reasonably
they
chose
stupidity
such
is
the
foundation
of
moral
ideas
what
a
paradox
exclaimed
romilly
the
physician
calmly
proceeded
the
distinction
between
good
and
evil
in
human
societies
has
never
emerged
from
the
grossest
empiricism
it
was
constituted
in
a
wholly
practical
spirit
and
as
a
simple
convenience
we
do
not
trouble
ourselves
about
it
where
or
a
tree
is
concerned
we
practise
moral
indifference
with
regard
to
animals
we
practise
it
in
the
case
of
savage
races
this
enables
us
to
exterminate
them
without
remorse
that
what
is
known
as
the
colonial
policy
nor
do
we
find
that
believers
exact
a
high
degree
of
morality
from
their
god
in
the
present
state
of
society
they
would
not
willingly
admit
that
he
was
lecherous
or
compromised
himself
with
women
but
they
do
think
it
fitting
that
he
should
be
vindictive
and
cruel
morality
is
a
mutual
agreement
to
keep
what
we
possess
land
houses
furniture
women
and
our
lives
it
does
not
imply
in
the
case
of
those
who
bow
to
it
any
particular
intelligence
or
character
it
is
instinctive
and
ferocious
written
law
follows
it
closely
and
is
in
more
or
less
harmonious
agreement
with
it
hence
we
see
that
men
or
men
of
brilliant
genius
have
almost
all
been
accused
of
impiety
and
like
socrates
the
son
of
phenaretes
and
benoît
malon
have
been
smitten
by
the
tribunals
of
their
country
and
it
may
be
stated
that
a
man
who
has
not
at
the
very
least
been
sentenced
to
imprisonment
does
little
credit
to
the
land
of
his
fathers
there
are
exceptions
remarked
pradel
few
replied
trublet
but
nanteuil
pursuing
her
idea
remarked
my
little
socrates
you
can
very
well
certify
that
he
was
insane
it
is
the
truth
he
was
not
sane
i
know
it
only
too
well
no
doubt
he
was
mad
my
dear
child
but
it
is
a
question
of
determining
whether
he
was
madder
than
other
men
the
entire
history
of
humanity
replete
with
tortures
ecstasies
and
massacres
is
the
history
of
raving
demented
creatures
doctor
inquired
constantin
marc
are
you
by
chance
one
of
those
who
do
not
admire
war
it
is
nevertheless
a
magnificent
thing
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
the
animals
merely
eat
one
another
men
have
conceived
the
idea
of
beautiful
massacres
they
have
learnt
to
kill
one
another
in
glittering
cuirasses
in
helmets
topped
with
plumes
or
maned
with
scarlet
by
the
use
of
artillery
and
the
art
of
fortification
they
have
introduced
chemistry
and
mathematics
among
the
necessary
means
of
destruction
war
is
a
sublime
invention
and
since
the
extermination
of
human
beings
appears
to
us
the
only
object
of
life
the
wisdom
of
man
resides
in
this
that
he
has
made
this
extermination
a
delight
and
a
splendour
after
all
doctor
you
can
not
deny
that
murder
is
a
law
of
nature
and
that
it
is
consequently
divine
to
which
socrates
replied
we
are
only
miserable
animals
and
yet
we
are
our
own
providence
and
our
own
gods
the
lower
animals
whose
immemorial
reign
preceded
our
own
upon
this
planet
have
transformed
it
by
their
genius
and
their
courage
the
insects
have
traced
roads
excavated
the
soil
hollowed
the
trunks
of
trees
and
rocks
built
dwellings
founded
cities
metamorphosed
the
soil
the
air
and
the
waters
the
labour
of
the
humblest
of
these
that
of
the
madrepores
has
created
islands
and
continents
every
material
change
produces
a
moral
change
since
morals
depend
upon
environment
the
transformation
to
which
man
in
his
turn
has
subjected
the
earth
is
undoubtedly
more
profound
and
more
harmonious
than
the
transformation
wrought
by
other
animals
why
should
not
humanity
succeed
in
changing
nature
to
the
extent
of
making
it
pacific
why
should
not
humanity
miserably
puny
though
it
is
and
will
be
succeed
some
day
in
suppressing
or
at
least
in
controlling
the
struggle
for
life
why
indeed
should
not
humanity
abolish
the
law
of
murder
we
may
expect
a
great
deal
from
chemistry
yet
i
do
not
guarantee
anything
it
is
possible
that
our
race
will
persist
in
melancholy
delirium
mania
dementia
and
stupor
until
its
lamentable
end
amid
ice
and
darkness
this
world
is
perhaps
irremediably
wicked
at
all
events
i
shall
have
got
plenty
of
amusement
out
of
it
it
affords
those
who
are
in
it
an
interesting
spectacle
and
i
am
beginning
to
think
that
chevalier
was
madder
than
the
rest
in
that
he
voluntarily
left
his
seat
nanteuil
took
a
pen
from
the
desk
and
held
it
out
dipped
in
ink
to
the
doctor
he
began
to
write
having
been
called
on
several
occasions
to
attend
he
interrupted
himself
to
ask
chevalier
christian
name
aimé
replied
nanteuil
aimé
chevalier
i
have
noticed
in
his
system
certain
disorders
of
sensibility
vision
and
motor
control
ordinary
indications
of
he
went
to
fetch
a
book
from
a
shelf
of
his
library
it
a
thousand
chances
that
i
shall
find
something
to
confirm
my
diagnosis
in
the
lectures
of
professor
ball
on
mental
diseases
he
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
book
just
see
my
dear
romilly
this
is
what
i
find
to
begin
with
in
the
eighteenth
lecture
page
madmen
are
to
be
met
with
among
actors
this
remark
of
professor
ball
reminds
me
that
the
celebrated
cabanis
one
day
asked
esprit
blanche
whether
the
stage
was
not
a
cause
of
madness
really
asked
romilly
uneasily
not
a
doubt
of
it
replied
trublet
but
listen
to
what
professor
ball
says
on
the
same
page
is
an
incontestable
fact
that
medical
men
are
excessively
predisposed
to
mental
aberration
nothing
is
truer
among
medical
men
those
who
are
more
especially
predestined
to
insanity
are
the
alienists
it
is
often
difficult
to
determine
which
of
the
two
is
the
crazier
the
madman
or
his
doctor
people
say
too
that
men
of
genius
are
prone
to
insanity
that
is
certainly
the
case
still
a
man
is
not
a
reasoning
being
merely
because
he
is
an
idiot
after
glancing
a
little
further
through
the
pages
of
professor
lectures
he
resumed
his
writing
ordinary
indications
of
maniacal
excitement
and
if
it
be
taken
into
consideration
that
the
subject
was
of
a
neuropathic
temperament
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
his
constitution
predisposed
him
to
insanity
which
according
to
the
highest
authorities
is
merely
an
exaggeration
of
the
habitual
temperament
of
the
individual
and
hence
it
is
not
possible
to
credit
him
with
full
moral
responsibility
he
signed
the
sheet
and
handed
it
to
pradel
saying
here
something
that
is
innocuous
and
too
devoid
of
meaning
to
contain
the
slightest
falsehood
pradel
rose
and
said
believe
me
my
dear
doctors
we
should
not
have
asked
you
to
tell
a
lie
why
not
i
am
a
medical
man
i
keep
a
i
relieve
i
console
how
is
it
possible
to
relieve
and
console
without
lying
then
with
a
sympathetic
glance
at
nanteuil
he
added
only
women
and
physicians
know
how
necessary
untruthfulness
is
and
how
beneficial
to
man
and
as
pradel
constantin
mate
and
romilly
were
taking
their
leave
he
said
pray
go
out
by
the
i
just
received
a
small
cask
of
old
armagnac
you
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
nanteuil
had
remained
behind
in
the
doctor
consulting
room
my
little
socrates
i
have
spent
an
awful
night
i
saw
him
during
your
sleep
no
when
wide
awake
you
are
sure
you
were
not
sleeping
quite
sure
he
was
on
the
point
of
asking
her
if
the
apparition
had
spoken
to
her
but
he
left
the
question
unspoken
fearing
lest
he
might
suggest
to
so
sensitive
a
subject
those
hallucinations
of
the
sense
of
hearing
which
by
reason
of
their
imperious
nature
he
dreaded
far
more
than
visual
hallucinations
he
was
familiar
with
the
docility
of
the
sick
in
obeying
orders
given
them
by
voices
abandoning
the
idea
of
questioning
félicie
he
resolved
at
all
hazards
to
remove
any
scruples
of
conscience
which
might
be
troubling
her
at
the
same
time
having
observed
that
generally
speaking
the
sense
of
moral
responsibility
is
weak
in
women
he
made
no
great
effort
in
that
direction
and
contented
himself
with
remarking
lightly
my
dear
child
you
must
not
consider
yourself
responsible
for
the
death
of
that
poor
fellow
a
suicide
inspired
by
passion
is
the
inevitable
termination
of
a
pathological
condition
every
individual
who
commits
suicide
had
to
commit
suicide
you
are
merely
the
incidental
cause
of
an
accident
which
is
of
course
deplorable
but
the
importance
of
which
should
not
be
exaggerated
thinking
that
he
had
said
enough
on
this
score
he
applied
himself
immediately
to
dispersing
the
terrors
which
surrounded
her
he
sought
to
convince
her
by
simple
arguments
that
she
was
beholding
images
which
had
no
reality
mere
reflections
of
her
own
thoughts
in
order
to
illustrate
his
demonstration
he
told
her
a
story
of
a
reassuring
nature
an
english
physician
he
told
her
was
attending
a
lady
like
yourself
highly
intelligent
who
like
yourself
was
in
the
habit
of
seeing
cats
under
her
furniture
and
was
visited
by
phantoms
he
convinced
her
that
these
apparitions
corresponded
to
nothing
in
reality
she
believed
him
and
worried
herself
no
longer
one
fine
day
after
a
long
period
of
retirement
she
reappeared
in
society
and
on
entering
a
she
saw
the
lady
of
the
house
who
pointing
to
an
begged
her
to
be
seated
she
also
saw
seated
in
this
chair
a
old
gentleman
she
argued
to
herself
that
one
of
the
two
persons
was
necessarily
a
creature
of
the
imagination
and
deciding
that
the
gentleman
had
no
real
existence
she
sat
down
on
the
on
touching
the
bottom
she
drew
a
long
breath
from
that
day
onward
she
never
again
set
eyes
on
any
further
phantoms
either
of
man
or
of
beast
when
smothering
the
old
gentleman
she
had
smothered
them
all
fundamentally
félicie
shook
her
head
saying
that
does
not
apply
to
this
case
she
meant
to
say
that
her
own
phantom
was
not
a
grotesque
old
man
on
whom
one
could
sit
but
a
jealous
dead
man
who
did
not
pay
her
visits
without
some
object
but
she
feared
to
speak
of
these
things
and
letting
her
hands
fall
upon
her
knees
she
held
her
peace
seeing
her
thus
dejected
and
crushed
he
pointed
out
that
these
disorders
of
the
vision
were
neither
rare
nor
very
serious
and
that
they
soon
vanished
without
leaving
any
traces
i
myself
he
said
once
had
a
vision
you
yes
i
had
a
vision
some
twenty
years
ago
it
was
in
egypt
he
noticed
that
she
was
looking
at
him
inquiringly
so
he
began
the
story
of
his
hallucination
having
switched
on
all
the
electric
lights
in
order
to
disperse
the
phantoms
of
darkness
in
the
days
when
i
was
practising
in
cairo
i
was
accustomed
in
the
february
of
each
year
to
go
up
the
nile
as
far
as
luxor
and
thence
i
proceeded
in
company
with
some
friends
to
visit
the
tombs
and
temples
in
the
desert
these
trips
across
the
sands
are
made
on
the
last
time
i
went
to
luxor
i
hired
a
young
whose
white
donkey
rameses
was
stronger
than
the
others
this
whose
name
was
selim
was
also
stronger
slenderer
and
better
looking
than
the
other
he
was
fifteen
years
old
his
shy
gentle
eyes
shone
from
behind
a
magnificent
veil
of
long
black
lashes
his
brown
face
was
a
pure
oval
he
tramped
barefoot
through
the
desert
with
a
step
which
made
one
think
of
those
dances
of
warriors
of
which
the
bible
speaks
his
every
movement
was
graceful
his
young
gaiety
was
charming
as
he
prodded
rameses
back
with
the
point
of
his
stick
he
would
chatter
to
me
in
a
limited
vocabulary
in
which
english
french
and
arabic
were
intermingled
he
enjoyed
telling
me
of
the
travellers
whom
he
had
escorted
and
who
he
believed
were
all
princes
or
princesses
but
if
i
asked
him
about
his
relations
or
his
companions
he
remained
silent
and
assumed
an
air
of
indifference
and
boredom
when
cadging
for
a
promise
of
substantial
baksheesh
the
nasal
twang
of
his
voice
assumed
caressing
inflexions
he
thought
out
subtle
stratagems
and
expended
whole
treasuries
of
prayers
in
order
to
obtain
a
cigarette
noticing
that
i
liked
to
see
the
treat
their
beasts
with
kindness
he
used
in
my
presence
to
kiss
rameses
on
the
nostrils
and
when
we
halted
he
would
waltz
with
him
he
often
displayed
real
ingenuity
in
getting
what
he
wanted
but
he
was
far
too
ever
to
show
the
slightest
gratitude
for
what
he
had
obtained
greedy
of
piastres
he
coveted
still
more
eagerly
such
small
glittering
articles
as
one
can
not
keep
covered
gold
rings
or
nickel
and
when
he
saw
a
gold
chain
his
face
would
light
up
with
a
gleam
of
pleasure
the
following
summer
was
the
hardest
time
of
my
life
an
epidemic
of
cholera
had
broken
out
in
lower
egypt
i
was
running
about
the
town
all
day
long
in
a
scorching
atmosphere
cairo
summers
are
overpowering
to
europeans
we
were
going
through
the
hottest
weeks
i
had
ever
known
i
heard
one
day
that
selim
brought
before
the
native
court
of
cairo
had
been
sentenced
to
death
he
had
murdered
the
daughter
of
some
fellaheen
a
little
girl
nine
years
old
in
order
to
rob
her
of
her
and
had
thrown
her
into
a
cistern
the
rings
stained
with
blood
had
been
found
under
a
big
stone
in
the
valley
of
the
kings
they
were
the
crude
jewels
which
the
nubian
nomads
hammer
out
of
shillings
or
pieces
i
was
told
that
selim
would
certainly
be
hanged
because
the
little
girl
mother
refused
the
tendered
now
the
khedive
does
not
enjoy
the
prerogative
of
mercy
and
the
murderer
according
to
moslem
law
can
redeem
his
life
only
if
the
parents
of
the
victim
consent
to
receive
from
him
a
sum
of
money
as
compensation
i
was
too
busy
to
give
thought
to
the
matter
i
could
readily
imagine
that
selim
cunning
but
thoughtless
caressing
yet
unfeeling
had
played
with
the
little
girl
torn
off
her
killed
her
and
hidden
her
body
the
affair
soon
passed
out
of
my
mind
the
epidemic
was
spreading
from
old
cairo
to
the
european
quarters
i
was
visiting
from
thirty
to
forty
sick
persons
daily
practising
venous
injections
in
every
case
i
was
suffering
from
liver
trouble
anæmia
was
playing
havoc
with
me
and
i
was
dropping
with
fatigue
in
order
to
husband
my
strength
i
took
a
little
rest
at
noon
i
was
accustomed
after
luncheon
to
lie
down
in
the
inner
courtyard
of
my
house
and
there
for
an
hour
i
bathed
myself
in
the
african
shade
as
dense
and
cool
as
water
one
day
as
i
was
lying
there
on
a
divan
in
my
courtyard
just
as
i
was
lighting
a
cigarette
i
saw
selim
approaching
with
his
beautiful
bronze
arm
he
lifted
the
and
came
towards
me
in
his
blue
robe
he
did
not
speak
but
smiled
with
his
shy
and
innocent
smile
and
the
deep
red
of
his
lips
disclosed
his
dazzling
teeth
his
eyes
beneath
the
blue
shadow
of
his
eyelashes
shone
with
covetousness
while
gazing
at
my
watch
which
lay
on
the
table
i
thought
he
had
escaped
and
this
surprised
me
not
because
captives
are
strictly
watched
in
oriental
prisons
where
men
women
horses
and
dogs
are
herded
in
imperfectly
closed
courtyards
and
guarded
by
a
soldier
armed
with
a
stick
but
moslems
are
never
tempted
to
flee
from
their
fate
selim
knelt
down
with
an
appealing
grace
and
approached
his
lips
to
my
hand
to
kiss
it
according
to
ancient
custom
i
was
not
asleep
and
i
had
proof
of
it
i
also
had
proof
that
the
apparition
had
been
before
me
only
for
a
short
time
when
selim
had
vanished
i
noticed
that
my
cigarette
which
was
alight
was
not
yet
tipped
with
ash
was
he
dead
when
you
saw
him
asked
nanteuil
not
a
bit
of
it
replied
the
doctor
i
heard
a
few
days
later
that
selim
in
his
jail
wove
little
baskets
or
played
for
hours
at
a
time
with
a
chaplet
of
glass
balls
and
that
he
would
smilingly
beg
a
piastre
of
european
visitors
who
were
surprised
by
the
caressing
softness
of
his
eyes
moslem
justice
is
slow
he
was
hanged
six
months
later
no
one
not
even
he
himself
was
greatly
concerned
about
it
i
was
in
europe
at
the
time
and
since
then
he
has
never
reappeared
never
nanteuil
looked
at
him
disappointed
i
thought
he
had
come
when
he
was
dead
but
since
he
was
in
prison
you
certainly
could
not
have
seen
him
in
your
house
you
only
thought
you
saw
him
the
physician
understanding
what
was
in
félicie
mind
quickly
replied
my
dear
little
nanteuil
believe
what
i
tell
you
the
phantoms
of
the
dead
have
no
more
reality
than
the
phantoms
of
the
living
without
attending
to
what
he
was
saying
she
asked
him
if
it
was
really
because
he
suffered
from
his
liver
that
he
had
a
vision
he
replied
that
he
believed
that
the
bad
state
of
his
digestive
organs
general
fatigue
and
a
tendency
to
congestion
had
all
predisposed
him
to
behold
an
apparition
there
was
i
believe
he
added
a
more
immediate
cause
stretched
out
on
my
divan
my
head
was
very
low
i
raised
it
to
light
a
cigarette
and
let
it
fall
back
immediately
this
attitude
is
particularly
favourable
to
hallucinations
it
is
sometimes
enough
to
lie
down
with
one
head
thrown
back
to
see
and
to
hear
imaginary
shapes
and
sounds
that
is
why
i
advise
you
my
child
to
sleep
with
a
bolster
and
a
fat
pillow
she
began
to
laugh
as
mamma
does
majestically
then
flitting
off
to
another
idea
tell
me
socrates
how
comes
it
that
you
saw
this
sordid
individual
rather
than
another
you
had
hired
a
donkey
from
him
and
you
were
no
longer
thinking
of
him
and
yet
he
came
say
what
you
like
it
queer
you
ask
me
why
it
was
he
rather
than
another
it
would
be
very
hard
for
me
to
tell
you
our
visions
bound
up
with
our
innermost
thoughts
often
present
their
images
to
us
sometimes
there
is
no
connection
between
them
and
they
show
us
an
unexpected
figure
he
once
more
exhorted
her
not
to
allow
herself
to
be
frightened
by
phantoms
the
dead
do
not
return
when
one
of
them
appears
to
you
rest
assured
that
what
you
see
is
a
thing
imagined
by
your
brain
can
you
she
inquired
guarantee
that
there
is
nothing
after
death
my
child
there
is
nothing
after
death
that
could
frighten
you
she
rose
picked
up
her
little
bag
and
her
part
and
held
out
her
hand
to
the
doctor
saying
as
for
you
you
do
believe
in
anything
do
you
old
socrates
he
detained
her
for
a
moment
in
the
warned
her
to
take
good
care
of
herself
to
lead
a
quiet
restful
life
and
to
take
sufficient
rest
do
you
suppose
that
is
easy
in
our
profession
i
have
a
rehearsal
in
the

one
on

and
i
have
to

kissed

turned
towards

to

with

constantin

trublet
was
in
subdued
tones
according
to
his
habit
delivering
his
moral
homilies
observe
he
said
that
they
are
lighting
on

about

in

mounted
on

at

proved
to
defraud
their

by
these
little
deceptions
this
observation
is
not
my
own
it
is
i
believe
renan
the
celebrant
standing
on
the
epistle
side
of
the
altar
was
reciting
in
a
low
voice
nolumus

who
is
taking

inquired
durville
of
romilly
regnard
he
be
no
worse
in
it
than
chevalier
pradel
plucked
trublet
by
the
sleeve
and
said
socrates
i
beg
you
to
tell
me
whether
as
a
scientific
man
as
a
physiologist
you
see
any
serious
objections
to
the
immortality
of
the
soul
he
asked
the
question
as
a
busy
and
practical
man
in
need
of
personal
information
you
are
doubtless
aware
my
dear
friend
replied
trublet
what
cyrano
bird
said
on
this
very
subject
one
day
cyrano
de
bergerac
heard
two
birds
conversing
in
a
tree
one
of
them
said
souls
of
birds
are
immortal
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
replied
the
other
it
is
inconceivable
that
beings
who
possess
neither
bill
nor
feathers
who
have
no
wings
and
walk
on
two
legs
should
believe
that
they
like
the
birds
have
an
immortal
soul
all
the
same
said
pradel
when
i
hear
the
organ
i
am
of
religious
ideas
requiem

the
celebrated
author
of
nuit
du
octobre
appeared
in
the
church
and
no
sooner
had
he
done
so
than
he
was
everywhere
at
one
and
the
same
moment
in
the
nave
under
the
porch
and
in
the
choir
like
the
he
must
bestriding
his
crutch
have
soared
above
the
heads
of
the
congregation
to
pass
as
he
did
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
from
morlot
the
deputy
who
being
a
freethinker
had
remained
in
the
parvis
to
kneeling
at
the
foot
of
the
catafalque
at
one
and
at
the
same
moment
he
whispered
into
the
ears
of
all
a
few
nimble
phrases
pradel
can
you
imagine
this
fellow
going
and
chucking
his
part
an
excellent
part
and
running
off
to
kill
himself
a
fool
blows
out
his
brains
just
two
days
before
the
first
night
compels
us
to
replace
him
and
sets
us
back
a
week
what
an
imbecile
a
rotten
bad
egg
but
we
must
do
him
justice
he
could
jump
and
jump
well
the
animal
well
my
dear
romilly
we
rehearse
the
new
man
at
two
see
to
it
that
regnard
has
the
script
of
his
part
and
that
he
knows
how
to
climb
on
to
the
roof
let
us
hope
he
wo
kick
the
bucket
on
our
hands
like
chevalier
what
if
he
too
were
to
commit
suicide
you
need
laugh
there
an
evil
spell
on
certain
parts
thus
in
my
the
gondolier
sandro
breaks
his
arm
at
the
dress
rehearsal
i
am
given
another
sandro
he
sprains
his
ankle
on
the
first
night
i
am
given
a
third
he
contracts
typhoid
fever
my
little
nanteuil
i
entrust
you
with
a
magnificent
rôle
to
create
when
you
get
to
the
français
but
i
have
sworn
by
the
great
gods
that
i
never
again
have
a
single
play
performed
in
this
theatre
and
immediately
under
the
little
door
which
shuts
off
the
choir
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
altar
showing
his
friends
racine
epitaph
which
is
let
into
the
wall
like
a
parisian
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
antiquities
of
his
city
he
recalled
the
history
of
this
stone
he
told
them
how
the
poet
had
been
buried
in
accordance
with
his
desire
at
at
the
foot
of
monsieur
hamon
grave
and
that
after
the
destruction
of
the
abbey
and
the
violation
of
the
tombs
the
body
of
messire
jean
racine
the
king
secretary
groom
of
the
chamber
had
been
transferred
all
unhonoured
to
and
he
told
how
the
tombstone
bearing
the
inscription
composed
for
boileau
beneath
the
knight
crest
and
the
shield
with
its
swan
argent
and
done
into
latin
by
monsieur
dodart
had
served
as
a
flagstone
in
the
choir
of
the
little
church
of
where
it
had
been
discovered
in
there
it
is
he
added
it
was
broken
in
six
pieces
and
the
name
of
racine
was
effaced
by
the
shoes
of
the
peasants
the
fragments
were
pieced
together
and
the
missing
letters
carved
anew
on
this
subject
he
expatiated
with
his
customary
vivacity
and
diffusiveness
drawing
from
his
prodigious
memory
a
multitude
of
curious
facts
and
amusing
anecdotes
breathing
life
into
history
and
endowing
archæology
with
a
living
interest
his
admiration
and
his
wrath
burst
forth
in
swift
and
violent
alternation
in
the
solemnity
of
the
church
and
amid
the
pomp
of
the
ceremony
i
would
give
something
to
know
for
instance
who
were
the
stupid
bunglers
who
set
this
stone
in
the
wall
jacet
nobilis
vir
johannes
it
is
not
true
they
make
honest
boileau
epitaph
lie
the
body
of
racine
is
not
in
this
spot
it
was
laid
to
rest
in
the
third
chapel
on
the
left
as
you
enter
what
idiots
then
suddenly
calm
he
pointed
to
pascal
tombstone
that
came
here
from
the
museum
of
the
no
praise
can
be
too
great
for
lenoir
who
in
the
days
of
the
revolution
collected
and
preserved
thereupon
he
improvised
a
second
lecture
on
lapidary
archæology
even
more
brilliant
than
the
first
transformed
the
history
of
pascal
life
into
a
terrible
yet
amusing
drama
and
vanished
in
all
he
had
remained
in
the
church
for
the
space
of
ten
minutes
over
those
heads
full
of
worldly
cares
and
profane
desires
the
rumbled
like
a
storm
mors

tell
me
dutil
how
could
that
little
nanteuil
who
is
pretty
and
intelligent
get
herself
mixed
up
with
a
dirty
mummer
like
chevalier
your
ignorance
of
the
feminine
heart
surprises
me
herschell
was
prettier
when
she
was
a
brunette
qui

i
must
be
off
to
lunch
do
you
know
anyone
who
knows
the
minister
durville
is
a
he
blows
like
a
grampus
put
me
in
a
little
paragraph
about
marie
falempin
i
can
tell
you
she
was
simply
delicious
in
trois
inter
oves
locum
presta
et
ab
hædis
me
sequestra
statuens
in
parte
dextra
so
then
it
is
for
nanteuil
sake
that
he
blew
out
his
brains
a
little
ninny
who
is
worth
spanking
the
celebrant
poured
the
wine
and
the
water
into
the
chance
saying
deus
qui
humanæ
substantiæ
dignitatem
mirabiliter
condidisu
is
it
really
true
doctor
that
he
killed
himself
because
nanteuil
would
have
any
more
to
do
with
him
he
killed
himself
replied
trublet
because
she
loved
another
the
obsession
of
genetic
images
frequently
determines
mania
and
melancholia
you
do
understand
actors
socrates
said
pradel
he
killed
himself
to
cause
a
sensation
and
for
no
other
reason
it
not
only
actors
said
constantin
marc
who
suffer
from
an
uncontrollable
desire
to
attract
attention
to
themselves
at
whatever
cost
last
year
in
the
place
where
i
live
while
a
was
at
work
a
boy
shoved
his
arm
into
the
gear
it
was
crushed
up
to
the
shoulder
the
surgeon
who
amputated
it
asked
him
as
he
was
dressing
the
stump
why
he
mutilated
himself
like
that
the
boy
confessed
that
it
was
to
draw
attention
to
himself
meanwhile
nanteuil
with
dry
eyes
and
pursed
lips
had
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
black
cloth
with
which
the
catafalque
was
covered
and
was
impatiently
waiting
until
enough
holy
water
candles
and
latin
prayers
should
be
bestowed
upon
the
dead
man
for
him
to
depart
in
peace
she
had
seen
him
again
the
night
before
and
she
thought
he
had
returned
because
the
priests
had
not
yet
bidden
him
to
rest
in
peace
then
reflecting
that
one
day
she
too
would
die
and
would
like
him
be
laid
in
a
coffin
beneath
a
black
pall
she
shuddered
with
horror
and
closed
her
eyes
the
idea
of
life
was
so
strong
within
her
that
she
pictured
death
as
a
hideous
life
afraid
of
death
she
prayed
for
a
long
life
kneeling
with
bowed
head
the
voluptuous
ashen
cloud
of
her
buoyant
hair
falling
over
her
forehead
she
a
profane
penitent
was
reading
in
her
words
which
reassured
her
although
she
did
not
understand
them
lord
jesus
christ
king
of
glory
deliver
the
souls
of
all
the
faithful
dead
from
the
pains
of
hell
and
from
the
depths
of
the
bottomless
pit
deliver
them
from
the
lion
jaws
let
them
not
be
plunged
into
hell
and
let
them
not
fall
into
the
outer
darkness
but
suffer
that

them
to
the
holy
light
promised
by
thee
to
abraham
and
to
his
posterity
at
the
elevation
of
the
host
the
congregation
permeated
by
a
vague
impression
that
the
mystery
was
becoming
more
sacred
ceased
its
private
conversations
and
assumed
a
certain
appearance
of
reverent
devotion
and
as
the
organ
fell
silent
all
heads
were
bowed
at
the
tinkling
of
a
little
bell
which
was
shaken
by
a
child
then
after
the
last
gospel
when
the
service
being
over
the
priest
attended
by
his
acolytes
approached
the
catafalque
to
the
chanting
of
the
a
sense
of
relief
was
experienced
by
the
crowd
and
they
began
to
jostle
one
another
a
little
in
order
to
file
past
the
coffin
the
women
whose
piety
grief
and
contrition
were
contingent
upon
their
immobility
and
their
kneeling
posture
were
at
once
recalled
to
their
customary
frame
of
mind
by
the
movement
and
the
encounters
of
the
procession
they
exchanged
amongst
themselves
and
with
the
men
remarks
relating
to
their
profession
do
you
know
said
ellen
midi
to
falempin
that
nanteuil
is
going
to
join
the
it
not
possible
the
contract
is
signed
how
did
she
manage
it
not
by
her
acting
you
may
be
sure
replied
ellen
who
proceeded
to
relate
a
highly
scandalous
story
take
care
said
falempin
she
is
just
behind
you
yes
i
see
her
she
got
a
cheek
of
her
own
to
show
herself
here
do
you
think
whispered
an
extraordinary
piece
of
news
into
ear
they
say
he
committed
suicide
well
there
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
he
did
commit
suicide
at
all
and
the
proof
of
it
is
that
he
is
being
buried
with
the
rites
of
the
church
what
then
inquired
durville
monsieur
de
ligny
surprised
him
with
nanteuil
and
killed
him
come
come
i
can
assure
you
that
i
am
accurately
informed
the
conversations
were
becoming
animated
and
familiar
so
you
are
here
you
wicked
old
sinner
the
receipts
are
falling
off
already
stella
has
succeeded
in
getting
herself
proposed
by
seventeen
deputies
nine
of
whom
are
members
of
the
budget
commission
yet
i
told
herschell
little
bocquet
fellow
is
the
man
for
you
what
you
need
is
a
man
of
standing
when
the
bier
borne
by
the
undertaker
men
passed
through
the
west
door
the
delicious
rays
of
a
winter
sun
fell
on
the
faces
of
the
women
and
the
roses
lying
on
the
coffin
grouped
on
either
side
of
the
parvis
a
few
young
men
from
the
great
colleges
sought
the
faces
of
celebrities
the
little
factory
girls
from
the
neighbouring
workshops
standing
in
couples
with
arms
round
each
other
waists
contemplated
the
actresses
dresses
and
standing
against
the
porch
on
their
aching
feet
a
couple
of
tramps
accustomed
to
living
under
the
open
sky
whether
mild
or
sullen
slowly
shifted
their
dejected
gaze
while
a
college
lad
gazed
with
rapture
at
the
fiery
tresses
which
coiled
like
flames
on
the
nape
of
fagette
neck
she
had
stopped
on
the
topmost
step
in
front
of
the
doors
and
was
chatting
with
constantin
marc
and
a
few
journalists
monsieur
de
ligny
he
danced
attendance
upon
me
long
before
he
knew
nanteuil
he
used
to
gaze
upon
me
by
the
hour
with
eager
eyes
without
daring
to
speak
a
word
to
me
i
received
him
willingly
enough
for
his
behaviour
was
perfect
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
his
manners
are
excellent
he
was
as
reserved
as
a
man
could
be
at
last
one
day
he
declared
that
he
was
madly
in
love
with
me
i
told
him
that
as
he
was
speaking
to
me
seriously
i
would
do
the
same
that
i
was
truly
sorry
to
see
him
in
such
a
state
that
every
time
such
a
thing
happened
i
was
greatly
upset
by
it
that
i
was
a
woman
of
standing
i
had
settled
my
life
and
could
do
nothing
for
him
he
was
desperate
he
informed
me
that
he
was
leaving
for
constantinople
that
he
would
never
return
he
could
make
up
his
mind
either
to
remain
or
to
go
away
he
fell
nanteuil
who
thought
i
loved
him
and
wanted
to
keep
him
did
all
in
her
power
to
get
him
away
from
me
she
flung
herself
at
his
head
in
the
craziest
fashion
i
found
her
sometimes
a
trifle
ridiculous
but
as
you
may
imagine
i
did
not
place
any
obstacle
in
her
path
for
his
part
monsieur
de
ligny
with
the
object
of
inspiring
me
with
regret
with
vexation
or
what
not
perhaps
in
the
hope
of
making
me
jealous
responded
very
visibly
to
nanteuil
advances
and
that
is
how
they
came
to
be
together
i
was
delighted
nanteuil
and
i
are
the
best
of
friends
madame
doulce
hedged
in
on
either
side
by
the
onlookers
came
slowly
down
the
steps
indulging
herself
in
the
illusion
that
the
crowd
was
whispering
that
doulce
she
seized
nanteuil
as
she
was
passing
pressed
her
to
her
bosom
and
with
a
beautiful
gesture
of
christian
charity
enveloped
her
in
her
mantle
saying
through
her
sobs
try
to
pray
my
child
and
accept
this
medal
it
has
been
blessed
by
the
pope
a
dominican
father
gave
it
to
me
madame
nanteuil
who
was
a
little
out
of
breath
but
was
growing
young
again
since
she
had
renewed
her
experience
of
love
was
the
last
to
come
out
durville
pressed
her
hand
poor
chevalier
he
murmured
his
was
not
a
bad
character
answered
madame
nanteuil
but
he
showed
a
lack
of
tact
a
man
of
the
world
does
not
commit
suicide
in
such
a
manner
poor
boy
he
had
no
breeding
the
hearse
began
its
journey
in
the
colossal
shadow
of
the
panthéon
and
proceeded
down
the
rue
soufflet
which
is
lined
on
both
sides
with
booksellers
shops
chevalier
the
employés
of
the
theatre
the
director
socrates
constantin
marc
a
few
journalists
and
a
few
inquisitive
onlookers
followed
the
clergy
and
the
actresses
took
their
seats
in
the
mourning
coaches
nanteuil
disregarding
madame
doulce
advice
followed
with
fagette
in
a
hired
coupé
the
weather
was
fine
behind
the
hearse
the
mourners
were
conversing
in
familiar
fashion
the
cemetery
is
the
devil
of
a
way
montparnasse
half
an
hour
at
the
outside
do
you
know
nanteuil
is
engaged
at
the
do
we
rehearse
constantin
marc
inquired
of
romilly
to
be
sure
we
do
at
three
in
the
we
shall
rehearse
till
five
i
am
playing
i
am
playing
on
sunday
i
play
both
afternoon
and
evening
work
is
never
over
for
us
actors
one
is
always
beginning
over
again
always
putting
shoulder
to
the
wheel
adolphe
meunier
the
poet
laying
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
said
everything
going
well
romilly
how
are
you
getting
on
yourself
meunier
always
rolling
the
rock
of
sisyphus
that
would
be
nothing
but
success
does
not
depend
on
us
alone
if
the
play
is
bad
and
falls
flat
all
that
we
have
put
into
it
our
work
our
talent
a
bit
of
our
own
life
collapses
with
it
and
the
number
of
i
seen
how
often
the
play
has
fallen
under
me
like
an
old
hack
and
has
chucked
me
into
the
gutter
ah
if
one
were
punished
only
for
one
own
sins
my
dear
romilly
replied
meunier
sharply
do
you
imagine
that
the
fate
of
dramatic
authors
like
myself
does
not
depend
as
much
upon
the
actors
as
upon
ourselves
do
you
think
it
never
happens
that
actors
by
their
carelessness
or
clumsiness
ruin
a
work
which
was
meant
to
reach
the
heights
and
do
not
we
also
like
cæsar
legionary
become
seized
with
dismay
and
anguish
at
the
thought
that
our
fate
is
not
assured
by
our
own
valour
but
that
it
depends
on
those
who
fight
beside
us
such
is
life
observed
constantin
marc
in
every
undertaking
everywhere
and
always
we
pay
for
the
faults
of
others
that
is
only
too
true
resumed
meunier
who
had
just
seen
his
lyric
drama
et
come
hopelessly
to
grief
but
the
iniquity
of
it
disgusts
us
it
should
not
disgust
us
in
the
least
replied
constantin
marc
there
is
a
sacred
law
which
governs
the
world
which
we
are
forced
to
obey
which
we
are
proud
to
worship
it
is
injustice
holy
injustice
august
injustice
it
is
everywhere
blessed
under
the
name
of
happiness
fortune
genius
and
grace
it
is
a
weakness
not
to
acknowledge
it
and
to
venerate
it
under
its
true
name
that
rather
weird
what
you
have
just
said
remarked
the
gentle
meunier
think
it
over
resumed
constantin
marc
you
too
belong
yourself
to
the
party
of
injustice
for
you
are
striving
for
distinction
and
you
very
reasonably
want
to
throttle
your
competitors
a
natural
unjust
and
legitimate
desire
do
you
know
of
anything
more
stupid
or
more
odious
than
the
sort
of
people
we
have
seen
demanding
justice
public
opinion
which
is
not
however
remarkable
for
its
intelligence
and
common
sense
which
nevertheless
is
not
a
superior
sense
have
felt
that
they
constituted
the
precise
contrary
of
nature
society
and
life
quite
so
said
meunier
but
justice
justice
is
nothing
but
the
dream
of
a
few
simpletons
injustice
is
the
thought
of
god
himself
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
would
alone
suffice
to
make
me
a
christian
while
the
doctrine
of
grace
embodies
all
truths
divine
and
human
then
are
you
a
believer
asked
romilly
respectfully
no
but
i
should
like
to
be
i
regard
faith
as
the
most
precious
possession
which
a
man
can
enjoy
in
this
world
at
i
go
to
mass
every
sunday
and
feast
day
and
i
have
never
once
listened
to
the
exposition
of
the
gospel
by
the
without
saying
to
myself
would
give
all
i
possess
my
house
my
acres
my
woods
to
be
as
stupid
as
that
animal
there
michel
the
young
painter
with
the
mystic
beard
was
saying
to
roget
the
scene
painter
that
poor
chevalier
was
a
man
with
ideas
but
they
were
not
all
good
ones
one
evening
he
walked
into
the
radiant
and
transfigured
sat
himself
beside
us
and
twirling
his
old
felt
hat
between
his
long
red
fingers
he
cried
have
discovered
the
true
manner
of
acting
tragedy
hitherto
no
one
has
realized
how
to
act
tragedy
no
one
you
understand
and
he
told
us
what
his
discovery
was
just
come
from
the
chamber
they
made
me
climb
up
to
the
amphitheatre
i
could
see
the
deputies
swarming
like
black
insects
at
the
bottom
of
a
pit
suddenly
a
stumpy
little
man
mounted
the
tribune
he
looked
as
if
he
were
carrying
a
sack
of
coals
on
his
back
he
threw
out
his
arms
and
clenched
his
fists
by
jove
he
was
comical
he
had
a
southern
accent
and
his
delivery
was
full
of
defects
he
spoke
of
the
workers
of
the
proletariat
of
social
justice
it
was
magnificent
his
voice
his
gestures
gripped
one
very
bowels
the
applause
nearly
brought
the
house
down
i
said
to
myself
what
he
is
doing
i
do
on
the
stage
and
i
do
it
better
i
a
comic
actor
will
play
tragedy
great
tragedy
parts
if
they
are
to
produce
their
true
effect
ought
to
be
played
by
a
comedian
but
he
must
have
a
soul
the
poor
fellow
actually
thought
that
he
had
imagined
a
new
form
of
art
see
he
said
at
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
a
journalist
came
up
to
meunier
and
asked
him
is
it
true
that
robert
de
ligny
was
at
one
time
madly
in
love
with
fagette
if
he
in
love
with
her
he
has
been
so
long
only
a
fortnight
ago
he
asked
me
in
the
theatre
is
that
little
woman
and
he
pointed
to
fagette
i
can
not
understand
said
the
chronicler
of
an
evening
paper
to
a
chronicler
of
a
morning
paper
what
can
be
the
origin
of
our
mania
for
calumniating
humanity
i
am
amazed
on
the
other
hand
by
the
number
of
decent
people
i
come
across
it
is
enough
to
make
one
incline
to
the
belief
that
men
are
ashamed
of
the
good
they
do
and
that
they
conceal
themselves
when
performing
acts
of
devotion
and
generosity
do
you
think
that
is
so
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
replied
the
chronicler
of
the
morning
paper
every
time
i
have
opened
a
door
by
mistake
i
mean
this
both
literally
and
metaphorically
i
have
always
come
across
some
unsuspected
baseness
were
society
suddenly
turned
inside
out
like
a
glove
so
that
one
could
see
the
inside
we
should
all
faint
away
with
horror
and
disgust
some
time
ago
said
roger
to
the
painter
michel
i
used
to
know
chevalier
uncle
on
the
butte
de
montmartre
he
was
a
photographer
who
dressed
like
an
astrologer
a
crazy
old
fellow
always
sending
one
customer
the
portrait
of
another
the
customers
used
to
complain
but
not
all
of
them
there
were
even
some
who
thought
the
portraits
were
a
good
likeness
what
has
become
of
him
he
went
bankrupt
and
hanged
himself
in
the
boulevard
pradel
who
was
walking
beside
trublet
was
still
profiting
by
the
opportunity
of
obtaining
information
as
to
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
the
fate
of
man
after
death
he
obtained
nothing
that
seemed
to
him
sufficiently
positive
and
repeated
i
should
like
to
know
to
which
socrates
replied
men
were
not
made
to
know
men
were
not
made
to
understand
they
do
not
possess
the
necessary
faculties
a
man
brain
is
larger
and
richer
in
convolutions
than
that
of
a
gorilla
but
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
the
two
our
highest
thoughts
and
our
most
comprehensive
systems
will
never
be
anything
more
than
the
magnificent
extension
of
the
ideas
contained
in
the
head
of
a
monkey
we
know
more
about
the
world
than
the
dog
does
and
this
flatters
and
entertains
us
but
it
is
very
little
in
itself
and
our
illusions
increase
with
our
knowledge
but
pradel
was
not
listening
he
was
mentally
rehearsing
the
speech
which
he
had
to
deliver
at
chevalier
grave
when
the
funeral
procession
turned
towards
the
shabby
which
overflow
the
avenue
de
the
out
of
respect
for
the
dead
made
way
for
it
trublet
remarked
upon
this
men
he
said
respect
death
since
they
rightly
believe
that
if
it
is
respectable
to
die
every
one
is
assured
of
being
respectable
in
that
at
least
the
actors
were
excitedly
discussing
chevalier
death
durville
mysteriously
and
in
a
deep
voice
disclosed
the
tragedy
it
is
not
a
case
of
suicide
it
is
a
crime
of
passion
monsieur
de
ligny
surprised
chevalier
with
nanteuil
he
fired
seven
revolver
shots
at
him
two
bullets
struck
our
unfortunate
comrade
in
the
head
and
the
chest
four
went
wide
and
the
fifth
grazed
nanteuil
below
the
left
breast
is
nanteuil
wounded
only
slightly
will
monsieur
de
ligny
be
arrested
the
affair
is
to
be
hushed
up
and
rightly
so
i
have
however
the
best
authority
for
what
i
say
in
the
carriages
too
the
actresses
were
engaged
in
spreading
various
reports
some
felt
sure
it
was
a
case
of
murder
others
one
of
suicide
he
shot
himself
in
the
chest
with
a
revolver
asserted
falempin
but
he
only
succeeded
in
wounding
himself
the
doctor
said
that
if
he
had
been
attended
to
in
time
he
might
have
been
saved
but
they
left
him
lying
on
the
floor
bathed
in
blood
and
madame
doulce
said
to
ellen
midi
it
has
often
been
my
fate
to
stand
beside
a
deathbed
i
always
go
down
on
my
knees
and
pray
i
at
once
feel
myself
invaded
by
a
heavenly
serenity
you
are
indeed
fortunate
replied
ellen
midi
at
the
end
of
the
rue
on
the
wide
grey
boulevards
they
became
conscious
of
the
length
of
the
road
which
they
had
covered
and
the
melancholy
nature
of
the
journey
they
felt
that
while
following
the
coffin
they
had
crossed
the
confines
of
life
and
were
already
in
the
country
of
the
dead
on
their
right
stretched
the
yards
of
the
the
florists
shops
which
supplied
wreaths
for

creaked
in

it
seemed
amid

of

when
he
encountered
those
of

who
were

for

he
joyfully
drew
from

upon

as

as
he
whispered
into

ear
he
felt
excited
infatuated
he
became
sincere
he
really
desired
her
out
of
perverse
curiosity
because
he
wanted
to
do
something
extraordinary
and
was
certain
that
he
would
be
able
to
do
it
perhaps
because
of
his
professional
instinct
as
a
handsome
youth
and
lastly
because
in

saw
him
a

few
days

a
few

i
might
say
bring
an
episodical
character
into
powerful
relief
the
author
of
the

was
struck
by
the
performance

on
the
verge
of
success
the
sacred
flame
was
his
there
are
those
who
have
asked
what
was
the
cause
of
so
cruel
an
end
let
us
not
seek
for
that
cause
chevalier
died
of
his
art
he
died
of
dramatic
fever
he
died
consumed
by
the
flame
which
is
slowly
consuming
all
of
us
alas
the
stage
of
which
the
public
sees
only
the
smiles
and
the
tears
as
sweet
as
the
smiles
is
a
jealous
master
which
demands
of
its
servants
an
absolute
devotion
and
the
most
painful
sacrifices
and
at
times
claims
its
victims

the
name
of
all
your
comrades

farewell
the
handkerchiefs
were
at
work
wiping
away

us

chapter
xi
having
said
her
prayer
nanteuil
without
waiting
to
hear
speech
jumped
into
a
carriage
in
order
to
join
robert
de
ligny
who
was
waiting
for
her
in
front
of
the
montparnasse
railway
station
amid
the
throng
of
they
shook
hands
gazing
at
one
another
without
a
word
more
than
ever
did
they
feel
that
they
were
bound
together
robert
loved
her
he
loved
her
without
knowing
it
she
was
for
him
or
so
he
believed
merely
one
delight
in
the
infinite
series
of
possible
delights
but
delight
had
assumed
for
him
the
form
of
félicie
and
had
he
reflected
more
deeply
upon
the
innumerable
women
whom
he
promised
himself
in
the
vast
remainder
of
his
newly
begun
life
he
would
have
recognized
that
now
they
were
all
félicies
he
might
at
least
have
realized
that
without
having
any
intention
of
being
faithful
to
her
he
did
not
dream
of
being
unfaithful
and
that
since
she
had
given
herself
to
him
he
had
not
desired
any
other
woman
but
he
did
not
realize
it
on
this
occasion
however
standing
in
the
bustling
commonplace
square
on
seeing
her
no
longer
in
the
voluptuous
shadow
of
night
nor
under
the
caressing
glimmer
of
the
alcove
which
gave
her
naked
form
the
delicious
vagueness
of
a
milky
way
but
in
a
harsh
diffused
daylight
by
the
circumstantial
illumination
of
a
sunlight
devoid
of
splendour
and
without
shadows
which
revealed
beneath
her
veil
her
eyelids
that
were
seared
with
tears
her
pearly
cheeks
and
roughened
lips
he
realized
that
he
felt
for
this
woman
flesh
a
profound
and
mysterious
inclination
he
did
not
question
her
they
exchanged
only
tender
trivial
phrases
and
as
she
was
very
hungry
he
took
her
to
lunch
at
a
whose
name
shone
in
letters
of
gold
on
one
of
the
old
houses
in
the
square
they
had
their
meal
served
in
the
whose
rockery
fountain
and
solitary
tree
were
multiplied
by
mirrors
framed
in
a
green
trellis
when
seated
at
the
table
consulting
the
bill
of
fare
they
conversed
with
less
restraint
than
heretofore
he
told
her
that
the
emotions
and
worries
of
the
past
three
days
had
unstrung
his
nerves
but
he
no
longer
thought
about
it
and
it
would
be
absurd
to
worry
about
the
matter
any
further
she
spoke
to
him
of
her
health
complaining
that
she
could
not
sleep
save
for
a
restless
slumber
full
of
dreams
but
she
did
not
tell
him
what
she
saw
in
those
dreams
and
she
avoided
speaking
of
the
dead
man
he
asked
her
if
she
had
not
spent
a
tiring
morning
and
why
she
had
gone
to
the
cemetery
a
useless
proceeding
incapable
of
explaining
to
him
the
depths
of
her
soul
submissive
to
rites
and
propitiatory
ceremonies
and
incantations
she
shook
her
head
as
if
to
say
had
to
while
those
lunching
at
the
adjoining
tables
were
finishing
their
meal
they
talked
for
a
long
time
both
in
subdued
tones
while
waiting
to
be
served
robert
had
promised
himself
had
sworn
indeed
never
to
reproach
félicie
for
having
had
chevalier
for
her
lover
or
even
to
ask
her
a
single
question
in
this
connection
and
yet
moved
by
some
obscure
resentment
by
an
ebullition
of
or
natural
curiosity
and
also
because
he
loved
her
too
deeply
to
control
himself
he
said
to
her
with
bitterness
in
his
voice
you
were
on
intimate
terms
with
him
formerly
she
was
silent
and
did
not
deny
the
fact
not
that
she
felt
that
it
was
henceforth
useless
to
lie
on
the
contrary
she
was
in
the
habit
of
denying
the
obvious
truth
and
she
had
of
course
too
much
knowledge
of
men
to
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
when
in
love
there
is
no
lie
however
clumsy
which
they
can
not
believe
if
they
wish
to
do
so
but
on
this
occasion
contrary
to
her
nature
and
habit
she
refrained
from
lying
she
was
afraid
of
offending
the
dead
she
imagined
that
in
denying
him
she
would
be
doing
him
a
wrong
depriving
him
of
his
share
angering
him
she
held
her
peace
fearing
to
see
him
come
and
rest
his
elbows
on
the
table
with
his
fixed
smile
and
the
hole
in
his
head
and
to
hear
him
say
in
his
plaintive
voice
félicie
you
surely
can
not
have
forgotten
our
little
room
in
the
rue
des
martyrs
what
he
had
become
for
her
since
his
death
she
could
not
have
said
so
alien
was
it
to
her
beliefs
so
contrary
to
her
reason
and
so
antiquated
ridiculous
and
obsolete
did
the
words
which
would
have
expressed
her
feeling
seem
to
her
but
from
some
remote
inherited
instinct
or
more
likely
from
certain
tales
which
she
had
heard
in
her
childhood
she
derived
a
confused
idea
that
he
was
of
the
number
of
those
dead
who
in
the
days
of
old
were
wont
to
torment
the
living
and
were
exorcised
by
the
priests
for
upon
thinking
of
him
she
instinctively
began
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
she
checked
herself
only
that
she
might
not
seem
ridiculous
ligny
seeing
her
melancholy
and
distracted
blamed
himself
for
his
harsh
and
useless
words
while
at
the
very
moment
of
reproaching
himself
for
them
he
followed
them
by
others
equally
harsh
and
equally
useless
and
yet
you
told
me
it
was
not
true
she
replied
fervently
because
do
you
see
i
wanted
it
not
to
be
true
she
added
oh
my
darling
since
i
been
yours
i
swear
to
you
that
i
not
belonged
to
anyone
else
i
do
claim
any
merit
for
this
i
should
have
found
it
impossible
like
the
young
of
animals
she
had
need
of
gaiety
the
wine
which
shone
in
her
glass
like
liquid
amber
was
a
joy
to
her
eyes
and
she
moistened
her
tongue
with
it
with
luxurious
pleasure
she
took
an
interest
in
the
dishes
set
before
her
and
especially
in
the
de
terre
like
golden
blisters
next
she
watched
the
people
lunching
at
the
tables
in
the
attributing
to
them
according
to
their
appearance
ridiculous
opinions
or
grotesque
passions
she
noticed
the
glances
which
the
women
directed
toward
her
and
the
efforts
of
the
men
to
appear
handsome
and
important
and
she
gave
utterance
to
a
general
reflection
robert
have
you
noticed
that
people
are
never
natural
they
do
not
say
a
thing
because
they
think
it
they
say
it
because
they
think
it
is
what
they
ought
to
say
this
habit
makes
them
very
wearisome
and
it
is
extremely
rare
to
find
anyone
who
is
natural
you
you
are
natural
well
i
do
think
i
guilty
of
posing
you
pose
like
the
rest
but
you
pose
in
your
own
character
i
can
see
perfectly
well
when
you
are
trying
to
surprise
and
impress
me
she
spoke
to
him
of
himself
and
led
back
by
an
involuntary
train
of
thought
to
the
tragedy
enacted
at
neuilly
she
inquired
did
your
mother
say
anything
to
you
no
yet
she
must
have
known
it
is
probable
are
you
on
good
terms
with
her
why
yes
they
say
she
is
still
very
beautiful
your
mother
is
it
so
he
did
not
answer
her
and
sought
to
change
the
conversation
he
did
not
like
félicie
to
speak
to
him
of
his
mother
or
to
turn
her
attention
to
his
family
monsieur
and
madame
de
ligny
enjoyed
the
highest
consideration
in
parisian
society
monsieur
de
ligny
a
diplomatist
by
birth
and
by
profession
was
in
himself
a
person
worthy
of
the
greatest
consideration
he
was
so
even
before
his
birth
by
virtue
of
the
diplomatic
services
which
his
ancestors
had
rendered
to
france
his
had
signed
the
surrender
of
pondicherry
to
england
madame
de
ligny
lived
with
her
husband
on
the
most
correct
terms
but
although
she
had
no
money
of
her
own
she
lived
in
great
style
and
her
gowns
were
one
of
the
greatest
glories
of
france
she
received
intimate
visits
from
an
his
age
his
position
his
opinions
his
titles
and
his
great
fortune
made
the
connection
respectable
madame
de
ligny
kept
the
ladies
of
the
republic
at
arm
length
and
when
the
spirit
moved
her
gave
them
lessons
in
decorum
she
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
opinion
of
the
fashionable
world
robert
knew
that
she
was
looked
upon
with
respect
by
people
in
society
but
he
was
continually
dreading
that
in
speaking
of
her
félicie
might
fail
to
do
so
with
all
the
needful
reserve
he
feared
lest
not
being
in
society
she
might
say
that
which
had
better
have
been
left
unsaid
he
was
wrong
félicie
knew
nothing
of
the
private
life
of
madame
de
ligny
moreover
had
she
known
of
it
she
would
not
have
blamed
her
the
lady
inspired
her
with
a
naive
curiosity
and
an
admiration
mingled
with
fear
since
her
lover
was
unwilling
to
speak
to
her
of
his
mother
she
attributed
his
reserve
to
a
certain
aristocratic
arrogance
even
to
a
lack
of
consideration
for
her
at
which
the
pride
of
the
freewoman
and
the
plebeian
was
up
in
arms
she
was
wont
to
say
to
him
tartly
i
perfectly
free
to
speak
of
your
mother
the
first
time
she
had
added
mine
is
just
as
good
as
yours
but
she
had
realized
that
the
remark
was
vulgar
and
she
had
not
repeated
it
the
was
now
empty
she
looked
at
her
watch
and
saw
that
it
was
three
i
must
be
off
she
said
is
being
rehearsed
this
afternoon
constantin
marc
ought
to
be
at
the
theatre
already
another
queer
fellow
for
you
he
boasts
that
when
he
in
the
vivarais
he
ruins
all
the
women
and
yet
he
is
so
shy
that
he
dare
even
talk
to
fagette
and
falempin
i
frighten
him
it
amuses
me
she
was
so
tired
that
she
had
not
the
courage
to
rise
is
it
queer
they
are
saying
everywhere
that
i
engaged
for
the
français
it
not
true
there
not
even
a
question
of
it
of
course
i
ca
remain
indefinitely
where
i
am
in
the
long
run
one
would
get
besotted
there
but
there
is
no
hurry
i
have
a
great
part
to
create
in
we
shall
see
after
that
what
i
want
is
to
play
comedy
i
do
want
to
join
the
français
and
then
to
do
nothing
suddenly
gazing
in
front
of
her
with
eyes
full
of
terror
she
flung
herself
backwards
turned
pale
and
uttered
a
shrill
scream
then
her
eyelids
fluttered
and
she
murmured
that
she
could
not
breathe
robert
loosened
her
jacket
and
moistened
her
temples
with
a
little
water
she
spoke
a
priest
i
saw
a
priest
he
was
in
his
surplice
his
lips
were
moving
but
no
sound
came
from
them
he
looked
at
me
he
tried
to
comfort
her
come
now
my
darling
how
can
you
suppose
that
a
priest
a
priest
in
his
surplice
would
show
himself
in
a
restaurant
she
listened
obediently
and
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
you
are
right
you
are
right
i
know
it
well
enough
in
that
little
head
of
hers
illusions
were
soon
dispelled
she
was
born
two
hundred
and
thirty
years
after
the
death
of
descartes
of
whom
she
had
never
heard
yet
as
socrates
would
have
said
he
had
taught
her
the
use
of
reason
robert
met
her
at
six
after
the
rehearsal
under
the
arcades
of
the
odéon
and
drove
away
with
her
in
a
cab
where
are
we
going
she
inquired
he
hesitated
a
little
you
would
not
care
to
go
back
to
our
house
out
there
she
cried
out
at
the
suggestion
oh
no
i
could
oh
heavens
never
he
replied
that
he
had
thought
as
much
that
he
would
try
to
find
something
else
a
little
flat
in
paris
that
in
the
meantime
just
for
they
would
content
themselves
with
a
chance
abode
she
gazed
at
him
with
fixed
heavy
eyes
drew
him
violently
towards
her
scorching
his
neck
and
ear
with
the
breath
of
her
desire
then
her
arms
fell
away
from
him
and
she
sank
back
beside
him
dejected
and
relaxed
when
the
cab
stopped
she
said
you
will
not
be
vexed
with
me
will
you
my
own
robert
at
what
i
am
going
to
say
not
she
had
considered
it
necessary
to
make
this
sacrifice
to
the
jealous
dead
chapter
xii
on
the
following
day
he
took
her
to
a
furnished
room
commonplace
but
cheerful
which
he
had
selected
on
the
first
floor
of
a
house
facing
the
square
near
the
bibliothèque
nationale
in
the
centre
of
the
square
stood
the
basin
of
a
fountain
supported
by
lusty
nymphs
the
paths
bordered
with
laurel
and
spindlewood
were
deserted
and
from
this
spot
one
heard
the
vast
and
reassuring
hum
of
the
city
the
rehearsal
had
finished
very
late
when
they
entered
the
room
the
night
already
slower
to
arrive
in
this
season
of
melting
snow
was
beginning
to
cast
its
gloom
over
the
hangings
the
large
mirrors
of
the
wardrobe
and
overmantel
were
filling
with
vague
lights
and
shadows
she
took
off
her
fur
coat
went
to
look
out
of
the
window
between
the
curtains
and
said
robert
the
steps
are
wet
he
answered
that
there
was
no
flight
of
steps
only
the
pavement
and
the
road
and
then
another
pavement
and
the
railings
of
the
square
you
are
a
parisian
you
know
this
square
well
in
the
centre
among
the
trees
there
is
a
monumental
fountain
with
enormous
women
whose
breasts
are
not
as
pretty
as
yours
in
his
impatience
he
helped
her
to
undo
her
cloth
frock
but
he
could
not
find
the
hooks
and
scratched
himself
with
the
pins
i
am
clumsy
he
said
she
retorted
laughingly
you
are
certainly
not
so
clever
as
madame
michon
it
not
so
much
clumsiness
but
you
are
afraid
of
getting
pricked
men
are
a
cowardly
race
as
for
women
they
have
to
accustom
themselves
to
suffer
true
to
be
a
woman
is
to
be
nearly
always
ailing
he
did
not
notice
that
she
was
pale
with
dark
rings
round
her
eyes
he
desired
her
so
ardently
he
no
longer
saw
her
they
are
very
sensitive
to
pain
he
said
but
they
are
also
very
sensitive
to
pleasure
do
you
know
claude
bernard
no
he
was
a
great
scientist
he
said
that
he
did
hesitate
to
recognize
woman
supremacy
in
the
domain
of
physical
and
moral
sensibility
nantueil
unhooking
her
stays
replied
if
he
meant
by
that
that
all
women
are
sensitive
he
was
indeed
an
old
greenhorn
he
ought
to
have
seen
fagette
he
would
soon
have
discovered
whether
it
was
easy
to
get
anything
out
of
her
in
the
domain
how
did
he
express
it
of
physical
and
moral
sensibility
and
she
added
with
gentle
pride
do
you
make
any
mistake
robert
there
not
such
a
heap
of
women
like
myself
as
he
was
drawing
her
into
his
arms
she
released
herself
you
are
hindering
me
sitting
down
and
doubling
herself
up
in
order
to
undo
her
boots
she
continued
do
you
know
socrates
told
me
the
other
day
that
he
had
seen
an
apparition
he
saw
a
who
had
murdered
a
little
girl
i
dreamt
of
the
story
last
night
only
in
my
dream
i
could
not
make
out
whether
the
was
a
man
or
a
woman
what
a
the
dream
was
talking
of
socrates
just
guess
whose
lover
he
is
why
the
lady
who
keeps
the
circulating
library
in
the
rue
mazarine
she
is
no
longer
very
young
but
she
is
very
intelligent
do
you
think
he
is
faithful
to
her
i
take
off
my
stockings
it
more
becoming
and
she
went
on
to
tell
him
a
story
of
the
theatre
i
really
do
think
i
shall
remain
at
the
odéon
much
longer
why
you
see
pradel
said
to
me
before
rehearsal
dear
little
nanteuil
there
has
never
been
anything
between
us
it
is
ridiculous
he
was
extremely
decorous
but
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
we
were
in
a
false
position
with
regard
to
one
another
which
could
not
go
on
indefinitely
you
must
know
that
pradel
has
established
a
rule
formerly
he
used
to
pick
and
choose
among
his
he
had
favourites
and
that
caused
an
outcry
nowadays
for
the
better
administration
of
the
theatre
he
takes
them
all
even
those
he
has
no
liking
for
even
those
who
are
distasteful
to
him
there
are
no
more
favourites
everything
goes
splendidly
ah
he
a
director
all
through
is
pradel
as
robert
in
the
bed
listened
in
silence
she
went
up
to
him
and
shook
him
then
it
all
the
same
to
you
if
i
carry
on
with
pradel
no
my
dear
it
would
not
be
all
the
same
to
me
but
nothing
i
might
say
would
prevent
it
bending
over
him
she
caressed
him
ardently
pretending
to
threaten
and
to
punish
him
and
she
cried
then
you
do
really
love
me
that
you
are
not
jealous
i
insist
that
you
shall
be
jealous
then
suddenly
she
moved
away
from
him
and
hitching
over
her
left
shoulder
her
chemise
which
had
slipped
down
under
her
right
breast
she
loitered
in
front
of
the
and
inquired
uneasily
robert
you
have
not
brought
anything
here
from
the
other
room
nothing
thereupon
softly
timidly
she
slipped
into
the
bed
but
hardly
had
she
lain
down
when
she
raised
herself
from
the
pillow
on
her
elbow
and
craning
her
neck
listened
with
parted
lips
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
hear
slight
sounds
of
footsteps
along
the
gravel
path
which
she
had
heard
in
the
house
in
the
boulevard
de
villiers
she
ran
to
the
window
she
saw
the
judas
tree
the
lawn
the
garden
gate
knowing
what
she
was
yet
to
see
she
sought
to
hide
her
face
in
her
hands
but
she
could
not
raise
her
arms
and
chevalier
face
rose
up
before
her
chapter
xiii
she
had
returned
home
in
a
burning
fever
robert
after
dining
had
retired
to
his
attic
his
nerves
were
on
edge
and
he
was
badly
out
of
temper
as
a
result
of
the
manner
in
which
nanteuil
had
left
him
his
shirt
and
his
clothes
laid
out
on
the
bed
by
his
valet
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
him
in
a
domestic
and
obsequious
attitude
he
began
to
dress
himself
with
a
somewhat
alacrity
he
was
impatient
to
leave
the
house
he
opened
his
round
window
listened
to
the
murmur
of
the
city
and
saw
above
the
roofs
the
glow
which
rose
into
the
sky
from
the
city
of
paris
he
scented
from
afar
all
the
amorous
flesh
gathered
on
this
winter
night
in
the
theatres
and
the
great
the
and
the
bars
irritated
by
félicie
denial
of
his
desires
he
had
decided
to
satisfy
them
elsewhere
and
as
he
was
not
conscious
of
any
preference
he
believed
that
his
only
difficulty
would
be
to
make
a
choice
but
he
presently
realized
that
he
had
no
desire
for
any
of
the
women
of
his
acquaintance
nor
did
he
even
feel
any
desire
for
an
unknown
woman
he
closed
his
window
and
seated
himself
before
the
fire
it
was
a
coke
fire
madame
de
ligny
who
wore
cloaks
costing
a
thousand
pounds
was
wont
to
economize
in
the
matter
of
her
table
and
her
fires
she
would
not
allow
wood
to
be
burned
in
her
house
he
reflected
upon
his
own
affairs
to
which
he
had
so
far
given
little
or
no
thought
upon
the
career
he
had
embraced
and
which
he
beheld
obscurely
before
him
the
minister
was
a
great
friend
of
his
family
a
mountaineer
of
the
cévennes
brought
up
on
chestnuts
his
dazzled
eyes
blinked
at
the
tables
of
paris
he
was
too
shrewd
and
too
wily
not
to
retain
his
advantage
over
the
old
aristocracy
which
welcomed
him
to
its
bosom
the
advantage
of
harsh
caprices
and
arrogant
refusals
ligny
knew
him
and
expected
no
favours
at
his
hands
in
this
respect
he
was
more
perspicacious
than
his
mother
who
credited
herself
with
a
certain
power
over
the
dark
hairy
little
man
whom
every
thursday
she
engulfed
in
her
majestic
skirts
on
the
way
from
the
to
the
he
judged
him
to
be
disobliging
and
then
something
had
gone
wrong
between
them
robert
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
had
forestalled
his
minister
in
his
intimacy
with
a
lady
whom
the
latter
loved
to
the
verge
of
absurdity
madame
de
neuilles
a
woman
of
easy
virtue
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
hairy
little
man
suspected
it
and
regarded
him
with
an
unfriendly
eye
and
lastly
the
idea
had
grown
upon
him
at
the
quai
that
ministers
are
neither
able
nor
willing
to
do
very
much
but
he
did
not
exaggerate
matters
and
thought
it
quite
possible
that
he
might
obtain
a
minor
secretaryship
such
had
been
his
wish
hitherto
he
was
most
anxious
not
to
leave
paris
his
mother
on
the
contrary
would
have
preferred
that
he
should
be
sent
to
the
hague
where
a
post
as
third
secretary
was
vacant
now
of
a
sudden
he
decided
in
favour
of
the
hague
i
go
he
said
the
sooner
the
better
having
made
up
his
mind
he
reviewed
his
reasons
in
the
first
place
it
would
be
an
excellent
thing
for
his
future
career
again
the
hague
post
was
a
pleasant
one
a
friend
of
his
who
had
held
it
had
enlarged
upon
the
delightful
hypocrisy
of
the
sleepy
little
capital
where
everything
was
engineered
and
wangled
for
the
comfort
of
the
diplomatic
corps
he
reflected
also
that
the
hague
was
the
august
cradle
of
a
new
international
law
and
finally
went
so
far
as
to
invoke
the
argument
that
he
would
be
giving
pleasure
to
his
mother
after
which
he
realized
that
he
wanted
to
leave
home
solely
on
account
of
félicie
his
thoughts
of
her
were
not
benevolent
he
knew
her
to
be
mendacious
timorous
and
a
malicious
friend
he
had
proof
that
she
was
given
to
falling
in
love
with
actors
of
the
lowest
type
or
at
all
events
that
she
made
shift
with
them
he
was
not
certain
that
she
did
not
deceive
him
not
that
he
had
discovered
anything
suspect
in
the
life
which
she
was
leading
but
because
he
was
properly
distrustful
of
all
women
he
conjured
up
in
his
mind
all
the
evil
that
he
knew
of
her
and
persuaded
himself
that
she
was
a
little
jade
and
being
conscious
that
he
loved
her
he
believed
that
he
loved
her
merely
because
of
her
extreme
prettiness
this
reason
seemed
to
him
a
sound
one
but
on
analysing
it
he
perceived
that
it
explained
nothing
that
he
loved
the
girl
not
because
she
was
exceedingly
pretty
but
because
she
was
pretty
in
a
certain
uncommon
fashion
of
her
own
that
he
loved
her
for
that
which
was
incomparable
and
rare
in
her
because
in
a
word
she
was
a
wonderful
thing
of
art
and
voluptuousness
a
living
gem
of
priceless
value
thereupon
realizing
how
weak
he
was
he
wept
mourning
over
his
lost
freedom
his
captive
mind
his
disordered
soul
the
devotion
of
his
very
flesh
and
blood
to
a
weak
perfidious
little
creature
he
had
scorched
his
eyes
by
gazing
at
the
coke
fire
behind
the
bars
of
the
grate
he
closed
them
in
pain
and
under
his
closed
eyes
he
saw
negroes
leaping
before
him
in
an
obscene
and
bloody
riot
while
he
sought
to
remember
from
what
book
of
travel
read
in
boyhood
these
blacks
emerged
he
saw
them
diminish
resolve
themselves
into
imperceptible
specks
and
disappear
into
a
red
africa
which
little
by
little
came
to
represent
the
wound
seen
by
the
light
of
a
match
on
the
night
of
the
suicide
he
reflected
that
fool
of
a
chevalier
why
i
was
scarcely
thinking
of
the
fellow
suddenly
against
this
background
of
blood
and
flame
appeared
the
slender
form
of
félicie
and
he
felt
lurking
within
him
a
hot
cruel
desire
chapter
xiv
he
went
to
see
her
the
following
day
in
the
little
flat
in
the
boulevard
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
going
thither
he
did
not
particularly
care
to
meet
madame
nanteuil
she
bored
him
and
embarrassed
him
although
she
was
extremely
polite
to
him
even
to
obsequiousness
it
was
she
who
received
him
in
the
little
she
thanked
him
for
his
interest
in
félicie
health
and
informed
him
that
she
had
been
restless
and
unwell
the
night
before
but
was
now
feeling
better
she
is
in
her
bedroom
working
at
her
part
i
will
tell
her
that
you
are
here
she
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
monsieur
de
ligny
she
knows
that
you
are
very
fond
of
her
and
true
friends
are
rare
especially
in
the
theatrical
world
robert
observed
madame
nanteuil
with
an
attention
which
he
had
not
hitherto
bestowed
upon
her
he
was
trying
to
see
in
her
face
the
face
that
would
be
her
daughter
in
years
to
come
when
walking
in
the
street
he
was
fond
of
reading
in
the
faces
of
the
mothers
the
of
the
daughters
and
on
this
occasion
he
assiduously
deciphered
the
features
and
the
figure
of
this
woman
as
an
interesting
prophecy
he
discovered
nothing
either
of
bad
or
good
augury
madame
nanteuil
plump
was
not
unattractive
with
the
sensuous
fullness
of
her
contours
but
her
daughter
did
not
in
the
least
resemble
her
seeing
her
so
collected
and
serene
he
said
to
her
you
yourself
are
not
of
a
nervous
temperament
i
have
never
been
nervous
my
daughter
does
not
take
after
me
she
is
the
living
image
of
her
father
he
was
delicate
although
his
health
was
not
bad
he
died
of
a
fall
from
his
horse
you
take
a
cup
of
tea
wo
you
monsieur
de
ligny
félicie
entered
the
room
her
hair
was
outspread
upon
her
shoulders
she
was
wrapped
in
a
white
woollen
held
very
loosely
at
the
waist
by
a
heavy
embroidered
girdle
and
she
shuffled
along
in
red
slippers
she
looked
a
mere
child
the
friend
of
the
house
tony
meyer
the
picture
dealer
was
wont
when
he
saw
her
in
this
garment
which
was
a
trifle
monkish
in
appearance
to
call
her
brother
ange
de
charolais
because
he
had
discovered
in
her
a
resemblance
to
a
portrait
by
nattier
which
represented
mademoiselle
de
charolais
in
the
franciscan
habit
before
this
little
girl
robert
was
surprised
and
silent
it
kind
of
you
she
said
to
have
come
to
inquire
after
me
i
am
better
thank
you
she
works
very
hard
she
works
too
hard
said
madame
nanteuil
her
part
in
is
tiring
her
oh
no
mother
they
spoke
of
the
theatre
and
the
conversation
languished
during
a
moment
silence
madame
nanteuil
asked
monsieur
de
ligny
if
he
were
still
collecting
old
félicie
and
robert
looked
at
her
without
understanding
they
had
told
her
not
long
before
some
fiction
about
engraved
to
explain
the
meetings
which
they
had
not
been
able
to
conceal
but
they
had
quite
forgotten
the
fact
since
then
a
piece
of
the
moon
as
an
old
author
has
said
had
fallen
into
their
love
madame
nanteuil
alone
in
her
profound
respect
for
fiction
remembered
it
my
daughter
told
me
you
had
a
great
number
of
those
old
engravings
and
that
she
used
to
find
ideas
for
her
costumes
in
them
quite
so
madame
quite
so
come
here
monsieur
de
ligny
said
félicie
i
want
to
show
you
a
design
for
a
costume
for
the
part
of
cécile
de
rochemaure
and
she
carried
him
off
to
her
room
it
was
a
small
room
hung
with
flowered
paper
the
furniture
consisted
of
a
wardrobe
with
a
mirror
a
couple
of
chairs
upholstered
in
horsehairs
and
an
iron
bedstead
with
a
white
counterpane
above
it
was
a
bowl
for
holy
water
and
a
sprig
of
boxwood
she
gave
him
a
long
kiss
on
the
mouth
i
do
love
you
do
you
know
quite
sure
oh
yes
and
you
i
too
i
love
you
i
would
have
believed
that
i
could
love
you
so
then
it
came
afterwards
it
always
comes
afterwards
that
true
what
you
just
said
robert
before
one
does
know
she
shook
her
head
i
was
very
ill
yesterday
have
you
seen
trublet
what
did
he
say
he
told
me
that
i
needed
rest
and
quiet
my
darling
we
must
be
sensible
for
another
fortnight
do
you
mind
i
do
so
do
i
but
what
would
you
have
he
strolled
round
the
room
two
or
three
times
looking
into
every
corner
she
watched
him
with
some
little
uneasiness
dreading
lest
he
should
ask
her
questions
about
her
poor
jewels
and
her
cheap
trinkets
which
were
modest
enough
as
presents
but
she
could
not
in
every
case
explain
how
she
came
to
receive
them
one
may
say
anything
one
pleases
of
course
but
one
may
contradict
oneself
and
get
into
trouble
and
that
assuredly
is
not
worth
while
she
diverted
his
attention
robert
open
my
what
have
you
got
in
your
the
violets
you
gave
me
the
first
time
darling
do
leave
me
go
away
when
i
think
that
from
one
day
to
the
next
you
may
go
to
some
foreign
country
to
london
to
constantinople
i
feel
crazy
he
comforted
her
telling
her
that
there
had
been
some
thought
of
sending
him
to
the
hague
but
he
was
determined
not
to
go
he
would
get
himself
attached
to
the
minister
staff
you
promise
he
gave
the
promise
in
all
sincerity
and
she
became
quite
cheerful
pointing
to
the
little
wardrobe
with
its
she
said
look
darling
it
there
that
i
study
my
part
when
you
came
i
was
working
over
my
scene
in
the
fourth
i
take
advantage
of
being
alone
to
try
for
the
exact
tone
i
seek
a
broad
mellow
effect
if
i
were
to
listen
to
romilly
i
should
mince
my
words
and
the
result
would
be
wretched
i
have
to
say
do
not
fear
you
it
the
great
moment
of
the
part
do
you
know
how
romilly
would
have
me
say
do
not
fear
you
i
show
you
i
am
to
raise
my
hand
to
my
nose
open
my
fingers
and
speak
one
word
to
each
finger
separately
in
a
particular
tone
with
a
special
expression
do
not
fear
you
as
if
i
were
exhibiting
marionettes
it
a
wonder
he
does
not
ask
me
to
put
a
little
paper
hat
on
every
finger
subtle
intellectual
is
it
then
lifting
her
hair
and
uncovering
her
animated
features
she
said
i
show
you
how
i
do
it
suddenly
transfigured
seeming
of
greater
stature
she
spoke
the
words
with
an
air
of
ingenuous
dignity
and
serene
innocence
no
sir
i
do
not
fear
you
why
should
i
fear
you
you
thought
to
ensnare
me
and
you
have
placed
yourself
at
my
mercy
you
are
a
man
of
honour
now
that
i
am
under
the
shelter
of
your
roof
you
shall
tell
me
what
you
told
chevalier
your
enemy
when
he
entered
that
gate
you
shall
tell
me
are
in
your
own
house
i
am
yours
to
command
she
had
the
mysterious
gift
of
changing
her
soul
and
her
very
face
ligny
was
under
the
spell
of
this
beautiful
illusion
you
are
marvellous
listen
i
shall
wear
a
big
lawn
bonnet
with
lappets
one
above
the
other
on
either
side
of
my
face
you
see
in
the
play
i
am
a
young
girl
of
the
revolution
and
it
is
imperative
that
i
should
make
people
feel
it
i
must
have
the
revolution
me
do
you
understand
are
you
well
up
in
the
revolution
of
course
i
am
i
do
know
the
dates
to
be
sure
but
i
have
the
feeling
of
the
period
for
me
the
revolution
means
a
bosom
swelling
with
pride
under
a
crossed
neckerchief
knees
enjoying
full
freedom
in
a
striped
petticoat
and
a
tiny
blaze
of
colour
on
the
there
you
have
it
he
asked
her
questions
about
the
play
and
he
realized
that
she
knew
nothing
about
it
she
did
not
need
to
know
anything
about
it
she
divined
she
found
by
instinct
all
that
she
needed
from
it
at
rehearsals
i
never
give
them
a
hint
as
to
any
of
my
effects
i
keep
them
all
for
the
public
it
will
make
romilly
tear
his
hair
how
stupid
they
all
look
fagette
my
dear
will
make
herself
ill
over
it
she
sat
down
on
a
little
rickety
chair
her
forehead
but
a
moment
before
as
white
as
marble
was
rosy
she
had
once
more
assumed
her
cheeky
flapper
expression
he
drew
near
to
her
gazed
into
the
fascinating
grey
of
her
eyes
and
as
on
the
evening
before
when
he
sat
in
front
of
his
he
reflected
that
she
was
untruthful
and
cowardly
and
toward
her
friends
but
now
the
thought
was
tempered
with
indulgence
he
reflected
that
she
had
with
actors
of
the
lowest
type
or
that
she
at
least
made
shift
with
them
but
the
thought
was
tempered
with
a
gentle
pity
he
recalled
all
the
evil
that
he
knew
of
her
but
without
bitterness
he
felt
that
he
loved
her
less
because
she
was
pretty
than
because
she
was
pretty
in
her
own
fashion
in
a
word
that
he
loved
her
because
she
was
a
gem
endowed
with
life
and
an
incomparable
thing
of
art
and
voluptuousness
he
looked
into
the
fascinating
grey
of
her
eyes
into
their
pupils
where
tiny
astrological
symbols
seemed
to
float
in
a
luminous
tide
he
gazed
at
her
with
a
gaze
so
searching
that
she
felt
it
pierce
right
through
her
and
assured
that
he
had
seen
right
into
her
she
said
to
him
with
her
eyes
on
his
clasping
his
head
between
her
two
hands
oh
yes
i
a
rotten
little
actress
but
i
love
you
and
i
do
care
a
rap
for
money
and
there
are
many
as
good
as
me
and
you
know
it
well
enough
chapter
xv
they
met
daily
at
the
theatre
and
they
went
for
walks
together
nanteuil
was
playing
almost
every
night
and
was
eagerly
working
at
her
part
of
cécile
she
was
gradually
recovering
her
peace
of
mind
her
nights
were
less
disturbed
she
no
longer
made
her
mother
hold
her
hand
while
she
fell
asleep
and
no
longer
found
herself
suffocating
in
nightmares
a
fortnight
went
by
in
this
fashion
then
one
morning
while
sitting
at
her
combing
her
hairs
she
bent
her
head
toward
the
glass
as
the
weather
was
overcast
and
she
saw
in
it
not
her
own
face
but
the
face
of
the
dead
man
a
thread
of
blood
was
trickling
from
one
corner
of
his
mouth
he
was
smiling
and
gazing
at
her
thereupon
she
decided
to
do
what
she
thought
would
be
the
proper
and
efficacious
thing
she
took
a
cab
and
drove
off
to
see
him
going
down
the
boulevard
she
bought
a
bunch
of
roses
at
her
florist
she
took
them
to
him
she
went
down
on
her
knees
before
the
tiny
black
cross
which
marked
the
spot
where
they
had
laid
him
she
spoke
to
him
she
begged
him
to
be
reasonable
to
leave
her
in
peace
she
asked
his
forgiveness
for
having
treated
him
formerly
with
harshness
people
did
not
always
understand
one
another
in
life
but
now
he
ought
to
understand
and
forgive
her
what
good
did
it
do
to
him
to
torment
her
she
asked
no
better
than
to
retain
a
kindly
memory
of
him
she
would
come
and
see
him
from
time
to
time
but
he
must
cease
to
persecute
and
frighten
her
she
sought
to
flatter
and
soothe
him
with
gentle
phrases
i
can
understand
that
you
wanted
to
revenge
yourself
it
was
natural
but
you
are
not
wicked
at
heart
do
be
angry
any
more
do
frighten
me
any
more
do
come
to
see
me
any
more
i
come
to
you
i
come
often
i
bring
you
flowers
she
longed
to
deceive
him
to
soothe
him
with
lying
promises
to
say
to
him
stay
where
you
are
do
not
be
restless
any
longer
stay
where
you
are
and
i
swear
to
you
that
i
will
never
again
do
anything
to
offend
you
i
promise
to
submit
to
your
will
but
she
dared
not
lie
over
a
grave
and
she
was
sure
that
it
would
be
useless
that
the
dead
know
everything
a
little
wearied
she
continued
awhile
more
indolently
her
prayers
and
supplications
and
she
realized
that
she
no
longer
felt
the
horror
with
which
the
tombs
had
formerly
inspired
her
that
she
had
no
fear
of
the
dead
man
she
sought
the
reason
for
this
and
discovered
that
he
did
not
frighten
her
because
he
was
not
there
and
she
mused
he
is
not
there
he
is
never
there
he
is
everywhere
except
where
they
laid
him
he
is
in
the
streets
in
the
houses
in
the
rooms
and
she
rose
to
her
feet
in
despair
feeling
sure
that
henceforth
she
would
meet
him
everywhere
except
in
the
cemetery
chapter
xvi
after
a
fortnight
patience
ligny
urged
her
to
resume
their
former
intercourse
the
period
which
she
herself
had
fixed
had
elapsed
he
would
not
wait
any
longer
she
suffered
as
much
as
he
did
in
refusing
herself
to
him
but
she
dreaded
to
see
the
dead
man
return
she
found
lame
excuses
for
postponing
appointments
at
last
she
confessed
that
she
was
afraid
he
despised
her
for
displaying
so
little
common
sense
and
courage
he
no
longer
felt
that
she
loved
him
and
he
spoke
harshly
to
her
but
he
pursued
her
incessantly
with
his
desire
bitter
days
and
barren
hours
followed
as
she
no
longer
dared
to
seek
the
shelter
of
a
roof
in
his
company
they
used
to
take
a
cab
and
after
driving
for
hours
about
the
outskirts
of
the
city
they
would
alight
in
some
gloomy
avenue
wandering
far
down
it
under
the
bitter
east
wind
walking
swiftly
as
though
chastised
by
the
breath
of
an
unseen
wrath
once
however
the
weather
was
so
mild
that
it
filled
them
with
its
soft
languor
side
by
side
they
trod
the
deserted
paths
of
the
bois
de
boulogne
the
buds
which
were
beginning
to
swell
on
the
tips
of
the
slender
black
branches
dyed
the
violet
under
the
rosy
sky
to
their
left
stretched
the
fields
dotted
with
clumps
of
leafless
trees
and
the
houses
of
auteuil
were
visible
slowly
driven
coupés
with
their
elderly
passengers
crawled
along
the
road
and
the
pushed
their
perambulators
a
broke
the
silence
of
the
bois
with
its
humming
do
you
like
those
machines
asked
félicie
i
find
them
convenient
that
all
it
was
true
that
he
was
no
chauffeur
he
had
no
taste
for
any
kind
of
sport
he
concerned
himself
only
with
women
pointing
to
a
cab
which
had
just
passed
them
she
exclaimed
robert
did
you
see
no
jeanne
perrin
was
in
it
with
a
woman
and
as
he
displayed
a
calm
indifference
she
added
in
a
reproachful
tone
you
are
like
socrates
do
you
think
that
sort
of
thing
natural
the
lake
slept
bright
and
serene
within
its
sombre
walls
of
pines
they
took
the
path
to
their
right
which
skirted
the
bank
where
the
white
geese
and
swans
were
preening
their
feathers
at
their
approach
a
flotilla
of
ducks
like
living
hulls
their
necks
curving
like
prows
set
sail
toward
them
félicie
told
them
in
a
regretful
tone
that
she
had
nothing
to
give
them
when
i
was
little
she
went
on
to
say
papa
used
to
take
me
out
on
sundays
to
feed
the
animals
it
was
my
reward
for
having
learned
my
lessons
well
all
the
week
papa
used
to
delight
in
the
country
he
was
fond
of
dog
horses
all
animals
in
fact
he
was
very
gentle
and
very
clever
he
used
to
work
very
hard
but
life
is
difficult
for
an
officer
who
has
no
money
of
his
own
it
grieved
him
sorely
not
to
be
able
to
do
as
the
wealthy
officers
did
and
then
he
did
hit
it
off
with
mamma
papa
life
was
not
a
happy
one
he
was
often
wretched
he
did
talk
much
but
we
two
understood
one
another
without
speaking
he
was
very
fond
of
me
robert
dearest
later
on
in
the
distant
future
the
very
distant
future
i
shall
have
a
tiny
house
in
the
country
and
when
you
come
there
my
beloved
you
will
find
me
in
a
short
skirt
throwing
corn
to
my
fowls
he
asked
her
what
gave
her
the
idea
of
going
on
the
stage
i
knew
very
well
that
i
never
find
a
husband
since
i
had
no
dowry
and
from
what
i
saw
of
my
older
girl
friends
working
at
or
in
a
telegraph
office
i
was
not
encouraged
to
follow
in
their
steps
when
i
was
quite
a
little
girl
i
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
be
an
actress
i
had
once
acted
at
my
in
a
little
play
on
nicholas
day
i
thought
it
no
end
of
a
lark
the
schoolmistress
said
i
did
act
well
but
that
was
because
mamma
owed
her
for
a
whole
term
from
the
time
i
was
fifteen
i
began
to
think
seriously
about
going
on
the
stage
i
entered
the
conservatoire
i
worked
i
worked
very
hard
it
a
trade
but
success
brings
rest
opposite
the
chalet
on
the
island
they
found
the
moored
to
the
landing
ligny
jumped
into
it
pulling
félicie
after
him
those
tall
trees
are
lovely
even
without
leaves
she
said
but
i
thought
the
chalet
was
closed
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
ferryman
told
them
that
on
fine
winter
days
people
out
for
a
walk
liked
to
visit
the
island
because
they
could
enjoy
quiet
there
and
that
he
had
only
just
ferried
a
couple
of
ladies
across
a
waiter
who
was
living
amid
the
solitude
of
the
island
brought
them
tea
in
a
rustic
furnished
with
a
couple
of
chairs
a
table
a
piano
and
a
sofa
the
panelling
was
mildewed
the
planks
of
the
flooring
had
started
félicie
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
lawn
and
the
tall
trees
what
is
that
she
asked
that
big
dark
ball
on
the
poplar
that
mistletoe
my
pet
one
would
think
it
was
an
animal
rolled
round
the
branch
gnawing
at
it
it
is
nice
to
look
at
she
rested
her
head
on
her
lover
shoulder
saying
in
a
languid
tone
i
love
you
he
drew
her
down
upon
the
sofa
she
felt
him
kneeling
at
her
feet
his
hands
clumsy
with
impatience
gliding
over
her
and
she
suffered
his
attempts
inert
discouraged
foreseeing
that
it
was
useless
her
ears
were
ringing
like
a
little
bell
the
ringing
ceased
and
she
heard
on
her
right
a
strange
clear
glacial
voice
say
i
forbid
you
to
belong
to
one
another
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
voice
spoke
from
above
in
the
glow
of
light
but
she
did
not
dare
to
turn
her
head
it
was
an
unfamiliar
voice
involuntarily
and
despite
herself
she
tried
to
remember
his
voice
and
she
realized
that
she
had
forgotten
its
sound
and
that
she
could
never
again
remember
it
the
thought
came
to
her
perhaps
this
is
the
voice
he
has
now
terrified
she
swiftly
pushed
her
skirt
over
her
knees
but
she
refrained
from
crying
out
and
she
did
not
speak
of
what
she
had
just
heard
lest
she
should
be
taken
for
a
madwoman
and
because
she
realized
somehow
that
it
was
not
real
ligny
drew
away
from
her
if
you
do
want
anything
more
to
do
with
me
say
so
honestly
i
am
not
going
to
take
you
by
force
sitting
upright
with
her
knees
pressed
together
she
told
him
whenever
we
are
in
a
crowd
as
long
as
there
are
people
about
us
i
want
you
i
long
for
you
but
as
soon
as
we
are
by
ourselves
i
am
afraid
he
replied
by
a
cheap
spiteful
sneer
ah
if
you
must
have
a
public
to
stimulate
you
she
rose
and
returned
to
the
window
a
tear
was
running
down
her
cheek
she
wept
for
some
time
in
silence
suddenly
she
called
to
him
look
there
she
pointed
to
jeanne
perrin
who
was
strolling
on
the
lawn
with
a
young
woman
each
had
an
arm
about
the
other
waist
they
were
giving
one
another
violets
to
smell
and
were
smiling
see
that
woman
is
happy
her
mind
at
peace
and
jeanne
perrin
tasting
the
peace
of
habits
strolled
along
satisfied
and
serene
without
even
betraying
any
pride
in
her
strange
preference
félicie
watched
her
with
an
interest
which
she
did
not
confess
to
herself
and
envied
her
her
serenity
she
not
afraid
that
woman
let
her
be
what
harm
is
she
doing
us
and
he
caught
her
violently
by
the
waist
she
freed
herself
with
a
shudder
in
the
end
disappointed
frustrated
humiliated
he
lost
his
temper
called
her
a
silly
fool
and
swore
that
he
would
not
stand
her
ridiculous
way
of
treating
him
any
longer
she
made
no
reply
and
once
more
she
began
to
weep
angered
by
her
tears
he
told
her
harshly
since
you
can
no
longer
give
me
what
i
ask
you
it
is
useless
for
us
to
meet
any
more
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
between
us
besides
i
see
that
you
have
ceased
to
love
me
and
you
would
admit
if
for
once
you
could
speak
the
truth
that
you
have
never
loved
anyone
except
that
wretched
actor
then
her
anger
exploded
and
she
moaned
in
despair
liar
liar
that
an
abominable
thing
to
say
you
see
i
crying
and
you
want
to
make
me
suffer
more
you
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
i
love
you
to
make
me
miserable
it
cowardly
well
no
then
i
love
you
any
longer
go
away
i
do
want
to
see
you
again
go
but
it
true
what
are
we
doing
like
this
are
we
going
to
spend
our
lives
staring
at
each
other
like
this
wild
with
each
other
full
of
despair
and
rage
it
is
not
my
fault
i
ca
i
ca
forgive
me
darling
i
love
you
i
worship
you
i
want
you
only
drive
him
away
you
are
a
man
you
know
what
there
is
to
do
drive
him
away
you
killed
him
not
i
it
was
you
kill
him
altogether
then
oh
god
i
am
going
mad
i
am
going
mad
on
the
following
day
ligny
applied
to
be
sent
as

was
appointed
a
week
later
and
left
at
once
without
having
seen
félicie
again
chapter
xvii
madam
nanteuil
thought
of
nothing
but
her
daughter
welfare
her
liaison
with
tony
meyers
the
in
the
rue
de
clichy
left
her
with
plenty
of
leisure
and
an
unoccupied
heart
she
met
at
the
theatre
a
monsieur
bondois
a
manufacturer
of
electrical
apparatus
he
was
still
young
superior
to
his
trade
and
extremely
he
was
blessed
with
an
amorous
temperament
and
a
bashful
nature
and
as
young
and
beautiful
women
frightened
him
he
had
accustomed
himself
to
desiring
only
women
who
were
not
young
and
beautiful
madame
nanteuil
was
still
a
very
pleasing
woman
but
one
night
when
she
was
badly
dressed
and
did
not
look
her
best
he
made
her
the
offer
of
his
affections
she
accepted
him
as
something
of
a
help
toward
housekeeping
and
so
that
her
daughter
should
want
for
nothing
her
devotion
brought
her
happiness
monsieur
bondois
loved
her
and
courted
her
most
ardently
at
the
outset
this
surprised
her
then
it
brought
her
happiness
and
peace
of
mind
it
seemed
to
her
natural
and
good
to
be
loved
and
she
could
not
believe
that
her
time
for
love
was
past
when
she
was
in
receipt
of
proof
to
the
contrary
she
had
always
displayed
a
kindly
disposition
an
character
and
an
even
temper
but
never
yet
had
she
revealed
in
her
home
so
happy
a
spirit
and
such
gracious
thoughtfulness
kind
to
others
and
to
herself
always
preserving
in
the
lapse
of
changeful
hours
the
smile
that
disclosed
her
beautiful
teeth
and
brought
the
dimples
into
her
plump
cheeks
grateful
to
life
for
what
it
was
giving
her
blooming
expanding
overflowing
she
was
the
joy
and
the
youth
of
the
house
while
madame
nanteuil
conceived
and
gave
expression
to
bright
and
cheerful
ideas
félicie
was
fast
becoming
gloomy
fretful
and
sullen
lines
began
to
show
in
her
pretty
face
her
voice
assumed
a
grating
quality
she
had
at
once
realized
the
position
which
monsieur
bondois
occupied
in
the
household
and
whether
she
would
have
preferred
her
mother
to
live
and
breathe
for
her
alone
whether
her
filial
piety
suffered
because
she
was
forced
to
respect
her
less
whether
she
envied
her
happiness
or
whether
she
merely
felt
the
distress
which
love
affairs
cause
us
when
we
are
brought
into
too
close
contact
with
them
félicie
more
especially
at
and
every
day
bitterly
reproached
madame
nanteuil
in
very
pointed
allusions
and
in
terms
which
were
not
precisely
veiled
in
respect
of
this
new
friend
of
the
family
and
for
monsieur
bondois
himself
whenever
she
met
him
she
exhibited
an
expressive
disgust
and
an
unconcealed
aversion
madame
nanteuil
was
only
moderately
distressed
by
this
and
she
excused
her
daughter
by
reflecting
that
the
young
girl
had
as
yet
no
experience
of
life
and
monsieur
bondois
whom
félicie
inspired
with
a
superhuman
terror
strove
to
placate
her
by
signs
of
respect
and
inconsiderable
presents
she
was
violent
because
she
was
suffering
the
letters
which
she
received
from
the
hague
inflamed
her
love
so
that
it
was
a
pain
to
her
a
prey
to
consuming
visions
she
was
pining
away
when
she
saw
her
absent
friend
too
clearly
her
temples
throbbed
her
heart
beat
violently
and
a
dense
increasing
shadow
would
darken
her
mind
all
the
sensibility
of
her
nerves
all
the
warmth
of
her
blood
all
the
forces
of
her
being
flowed
through
her
sinking
downwards
merging
themselves
in
desire
in
the
very
depths
of
her
flesh
at
such
times
she
had
no
other
thought
than
to
recover
ligny
it
was
ligny
that
she
wanted
only
ligny
and
she
herself
was
surprised
at
the
disgust
which
she
felt
for
all
other
men
for
her
instincts
had
not
always
been
so
exclusive
she
told
herself
that
she
would
go
at
once
to
bondois
ask
him
for
money
and
take
the
train
for
the
hague
and
she
did
not
do
it
what
deterred
her
was
not
so
much
the
idea
of
displeasing
her
lover
who
would
have
looked
upon
such
a
journey
as
bad
form
as
the
vague
fear
of
awakening
the
slumbering
shadow
that
she
had
not
seen
since
ligny
departure
but
perturbing
things
were
happening
within
her
and
around
her
in
the
street
she
was
followed
by
a
which
appealed
and
vanished
suddenly
one
morning
when
she
was
in
bed
her
mother
told
her
i
am
going
to
the
dressmaker
and
went
out
two
or
three
minutes
later
félicie
saw
her
come
back
into
the
room
as
if
she
had
forgotten
something
but
the
apparition
advanced
without
a
look
at
her
without
a
word
without
a
sounds
and
disappeared
as
it
touched
the
bed
she
had
even
more
disturbing
illusions
one
sunday
she
was
acting
in
a
matinée
of
the
part
of
young
zacharias
as
she
had
very
pretty
legs
she
found
the
disguise
not
displeasing
she
was
glad
also
to
show
that
she
knew
how
verse
should
be
spoken
but
she
noticed
that
in
the
orchestra
stalls
there
was
a
priest
wearing
his
cassock
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
an
ecclesiastic
had
been
present
at
an
afternoon
performance
of
this
tragedy
drawn
from
the
scriptures
nevertheless
it
impressed
her
disagreeably
when
she
went
on
the
stage
she
distinctly
saw
louise
dalle
wearing
the
turban
of
jehoshabeath
loading
a
revolver
in
front
of
the
prompter
box
she
had
enough
common
sense
and
presence
of
mind
to
reject
this
absurd
vision
which
disappeared
but
she
spoke
her
first
lines
in
an
inaudible
voice
she
had
burning
pains
in
the
stomach
she
suffered
from
fits
of
suffocation
sometimes
without
apparent
cause
an
unspeakable
agony
gripped
her
bowels
her
heart
beat
madly
and
she
feared
that
she
must
be
dying
dr
trublet
attended
her
with
watchful
prudence
she
often
saw
him
at
the
theatre
and
occasionally
went
to
consult
him
at
his
old
house
in
the
rue
de
seine
she
did
not
go
through
the
the
servant
would
show
her
at
once
into
the
little
where
arab
potteries
glinted
in
the
shadows
and
she
was
always
the
first
to
be
shown
in
one
day
socrates
succeeded
in
making
her
understand
the
manner
in
which
images
are
formed
in
the
brain
and
how
these
images
do
not
always
correspond
with
external
objects
or
at
my
rate
do
not
always
correspond
exactly
hallucinations
he
added
are
more
often
than
not
merely
false
perceptions
one
sees
a
thing
but
one
sees
it
badly
so
that
a
becomes
a
head
of
bristling
locks
a
red
carnation
is
a
beast
open
mouth
and
a
chemise
is
a
ghost
in
its
insignificant
errors
from
these
arguments
she
derived
sufficient
strength
to
despise
and
dispel
her
visions
of
cats
and
dogs
or
of
persons
who
were
living
and
well
known
to
her
yet
she
dreaded
seeing
the
dead
man
again
and
the
mystic
terrors
nestling
in
the
obscure
crannies
of
her
brain
were
more
powerful
than
the
demonstrations
of
science
it
was
useless
to
tell
her
that
the
dead
never
returned
she
knew
very
well
that
they
did
on
this
occasion
socrates
once
more
advised
her
to
find
some
distraction
to
visit
her
friends
and
by
preference
the
more
pleasant
of
her
friends
and
to
avoid
darkness
and
solitude
as
her
two
most
treacherous
enemies
and
he
added
this
prescription
especially
must
you
avoid
persons
and
things
which
may
be
connected
with
the
object
of
your
visions
he
did
not
see
that
this
was
impossible
nor
did
nanteuil
then
you
will
cure
me
dear
old
socrates
she
said
turning
upon
him
her
pretty
grey
eyes
full
of
entreaty
you
will
cure
yourself
my
child
you
will
cure
yourself
because
you
are
sensible
and
courageous
yes
yes
you
are
timid
and
brave
at
the
same
time
you
dread
danger
but
you
have
the
courage
to
live
you
will
be
cured
because
you
are
not
in
sympathy
with
evil
and
suffering
you
will
be
cured
because
you
want
to
be
cured
you
think
then
that
one
can
be
cured
if
one
wills
it
when
one
wills
it
in
a
certain
profound
intimate
fashion
when
it
is
our
cells
that
will
it
within
us
when
it
is
our
unconscious
self
that
wills
it
when
one
wills
it
with
the
secret
abounding
absolute
will
of
the
sturdy
tree
that
wills
itself
to
grow
green
again
in
the
spring
chapter

that
same
night
being
unable
to
sleep
she
turned
over
in
her
bed
and
threw
back
the
she
felt
that
sleep
was
still
far
off
that
it
would
come
with
the
first
rays
full
of
dancing
atoms
of
dust
with
which
morning
pierces
the
chinks
between
the
curtains
the
with
its
tiny
burning
heart
shining
through
its
porcelain
shade
gave
her
a
mystic
and
familiar
companionship
félicie
opened
her
eyes
and
at
a
glance
drank
in
the
white
milky
glimmer
which
brought
her
peace
of
mind
then
closing
them
once
more
she
relapsed
into
the
tumultuous
weariness
of
insomnia
now
and
again
a
few
words
of
her
part
recurred
to
her
memory
words
to
which
she
attached
no
meaning
yet
which
obsessed
her
our
days
are
what
we
make
them
and
her
mind
wearied
itself
by
turning
over
and
over
some
four
or
five
ideas
i
must
go
to
madame
royaumont
to
try
on
my
gown
yesterday
i
went
with
fagette
to
jeanne
perrin
she
was
dressing
and
she
showed
her
hairy
legs
as
if
she
was
proud
of
them
she
not
ugly
jeanne
perrin
indeed
she
has
a
fine
head
but
it
is
her
expression
that
i
dislike
how
does
madame
colbert
make
out
that
i
owe
her
francs
fourteen
and
three
are
seventeen
and
nine
i
owe
her
only
francs
days
are
what
we
make
them
how
hot
i
feel
with
one
swift
movement
of
her
supple
loins
she
turned
over
and
her
bare
arms
opened
to
embrace
the
air
as
though
it
had
been
a
cool
subtle
body
it
seems
a
hundred
years
since
robert
went
away
it
was
cruel
of
him
to
leave
me
alone
i
am
sick
with
longing
for
him
and
curled
up
in
her
bed
she
recollected
intently
the
hours
when
they
held
each
other
in
a
close
embrace
she
called
him
my
little
wolf
and
immediately
the
same
train
of
thoughts
began
once
more
their
fatiguing
procession
through
her
mind
our
days
are
what
we
make
them
our
days
are
what
we
make
them
our
days
fourteen
and
three
seventeen
and
nine
i
could
see
quite
plainly
that
jeanne
perrin
showed
her
long
man
legs
dark
with
hair
on
purpose
is
it
true
what
they
say
that
jeanne
perrin
gives
money
to
women
i
must
try
my
gown
on
at
four
there
one
dreadful
thing
madame
royaumont
never
can
put
in
the
sleeves
properly
how
hot
i
am
socrates
is
a
good
doctor
but
he
does
sometimes
amuse
himself
by
making
you
feel
a
stupid
fool
suddenly
she
thought
of
chevalier
and
she
seemed
to
feel
an
influence
emanating
from
him
which
was
gliding
along
the
walls
of
her
bedroom
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
glimmer
of
the
was
dimmed
by
it
it
was
less
than
a
shadow
and
it
filled
her
with
alarm
the
idea
suddenly
flashed
through
her
mind
that
this
subtle
thing
had
its
origin
in
the
portraits
of
the
dead
man
she
had
not
kept
any
of
them
in
her
bedroom
but
there
were
still
some
in
the
flat
some
that
she
had
not
torn
up
she
carefully
reckoned
them
up
and
discovered
that
there
must
still
be
three
left
the
first
when
he
was
quite
young
showed
him
against
a
cloudy
background
another
laughing
and
at
his
ease
sitting
astride
of
a
chair
a
third
as
don
cæsar
de
bazan
in
her
hurry
to
destroy
every
vestige
of
them
she
sprang
out
of
bed
lit
a
candle
and
in
her
nightgown
shuffled
along
in
her
slippers
into
the
until
she
came
to
the
rosewood
table
surmounted
by
a
phoenix
palm
she
pulled
up
the
tablecloth
and
searched
through
the
drawer
it
contained
sockets
for
candles
a
few
scraps
of
wood
detached
from
the
furniture
two
or
three
lustres
belonging
to
the
chandelier
and
a
few
photographs
among
which
she
found
only
one
of
chevalier
the
earliest
showing
him
standing
against
a
cloudy
background
she
searched
for
the
other
two
in
a
little
piece
of
boule
furniture
which
adorned
the
space
between
the
windows
and
on
which
were
some
chinese
lamps
here
slumbered
of
ground
glass
goblets
ornamented
with
gilt
bronze
a
in
painted
porcelain
flanked
by
a
child
sleeping
against
a
drum
beside
a
dog
books
whose
bindings
were
detached
tattered
musical
scores
a
couple
of
broken
fans
a
flute
and
a
small
heap
of
portraits
there
she
discovered
a
second
chevalier
the
don
cæsar
de
bazan
the
third
was
not
there
she
asked
herself
in
vain
where
it
could
have
been
hidden
away
fruitlessly
she
hunted
through
boxes
bowls
flowerpot
holders
and
the
music
davenport
and
while
she
was
eagerly
searching
for
the
portrait
it
was
growing
in
size
and
distinctness
in
her
imagination
attaining
to
a
man
stature
was
assuming
a
mocking
air
and
defying
her
her
head
was
on
fire
her
feet
were
like
ice
and
she
could
feel
terror
creeping
into
the
pit
of
her
stomach
just
as
she
was
about
to
give
up
the
search
about
to
go
and
bury
her
face
in
her
pillow
she
remembered
that
her
mother
kept
some
photographs
in
her
wardrobe
she
again
took
courage
softly
she
entered
the
room
of
the
sleeping
madame
nanteuil
with
silent
steps
she
crept
over
to
the
wardrobe
opened
it
slowly
and
noiselessly
and
standing
on
a
chair
explored
the
top
shelf
which
was
loaded
with
old
cardboard
boxes
she
came
upon
an
album
which
dated
from
the
second
empire
and
which
had
not
been
opened
for
twenty
years
she
rummaged
among
a
mass
of
letters
of
bundles
of
receipts
and
vouchers
awakened
by
the
light
of
the
candle
and
by
the
noise
made
by
the
seeker
madame
nanteuil
demanded
who
is
there
immediately
perceiving
the
familiar
little
phantom
in
her
long
nightgown
with
a
heavy
plait
of
hair
down
her
back
perched
on
a
chair
she
exclaimed
it
you
félicie
you
are
not
ill
are
you
what
are
you
doing
there
i
am
looking
for
something
in
my
wardrobe
yes
mamma
will
you
kindly
go
back
to
your
bed
you
will
catch
cold
tell
me
at
least
what
you
are
looking
for
if
it
the
chocolate
it
is
on
the
middle
shelf
next
to
the
silver
but
félicie
had
seized
upon
a
packet
of
photographs
which
she
was
rapidly
turning
over
her
impatient
fingers
rejected
madame
doulce
bedecked
with
lace
fagette
radiant
her
hair
dissolving
in
its
own
brilliance
tony
meyer
with
eyes
and
a
nose
drooping
over
his
lips
pradel
with
his
flourishing
beard
trublet
bald
and
monsieur
bondois
with
timorous
eye
and
straight
nose
set
above
a
heavy
moustache
although
not
in
a
mood
to
bestow
any
attention
upon
monsieur
bondois
she
gave
him
a
passing
glance
of
hostility
and
by
chance
let
a
drop
of
disfigure
his
nose
madame
nanteuil
who
was
now
wide
awake
could
make
nothing
of
her
proceedings
félicie
why
on
earth
are
you
poking
about
in
my
wardrobe
like
that
félicie
who
at
last
held
the
photograph
for
which
she
had
sought
so
assiduously
responded
only
by
a
cry
of
fierce
delight
and
flew
from
the
chair
taking
with
her
her
dead
friend
and
inadvertently
monsieur
bondois
as
well
returning
to
the
she
crouched
down
by
the
fireplace
and
made
a
fire
of
paper
into
which
she
cast
chevalier
three
photographs
she
watched
them
blazing
and
when
the
three
bits
of
cardboard
twisted
and
blackened
had
flown
up
the
chimney
and
neither
shape
nor
substance
was
left
she
breathed
freely
she
really
believed
this
time
that
she
had
deprived
the
jealous
dead
man
of
the
material
of
his
apparitions
and
had
freed
herself
from
the
dreaded
obsession
on
picking
up
her
candlestick
she
saw
monsieur
bondois
whose
nose
had
disappeared
beneath
a
round
blob
of
white
wax
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
him
she
threw
him
with
a
laugh
into
the
still
flaming
grate
returning
to
her
room
she
stood
before
the
and
drew
her
nightgown
closely
about
her
in
order
to
emphasize
the
lines
of
her
body
a
thought
which
occasionally
flitted
through
her
mind
tarried
there
this
time
a
little
longer
than
usual
she
was
wont
to
ask
herself
why
is
one
made
like
that
with
a
head
arms
legs
hands
feet
chest
and
abdomen
why
is
one
made
like
that
and
not
otherwise
it
funny
and
at
the
moment
the
human
form
seemed
to
her
arbitrary
fantastic
alien
but
her
astonishment
was
soon
over
and
as
she
looked
at
herself
she
felt
pleased
with
herself
she
was
conscious
of
a
keen
delight
in
herself
she
bared
her
breasts
held
them
delicately
in
the
hollow
of
her
hands
looked
at
them
tenderly
in
the
glass
as
if
they
were
not
a
part
of
herself
but
something
belonging
to
her
like
two
living
creatures
like
a
pair
of
doves
after
smiling
upon
them
she
went
back
to
bed
waking
late
in
the
morning
she
felt
surprised
for
a
moment
at
being
alone
in
her
bed
sometimes
in
a
dream
she
would
divide
herself
into
two
beings
and
feeling
her
own
flesh
she
would
dream
that
she
was
being
caressed
by
a
woman
chapter
xix
the
dress
rehearsal
of
was
called
for
two
as
early
as
one
trublet
had
taken
his
accustomed
place
in
félicie
who
was
being
dressed
by
madame
michon
reproached
her
doctor
with
having
nothing
to
say
to
her
yet
it
was
she
who
preoccupied
her
mind
concentrated
upon
the
part
which
she
was
about
to
play
was
not
listening
to
him
she
gave
orders
that
nobody
should
be
allowed
to
come
into
her
for
all
that
she
received
constantin
visit
with
pleasure
for
she
found
him
sympathetic
he
was
getting
excited
in
order
to
conceal
his
agitation
he
made
a
pretence
of
talking
about
his
woods
in
the
vivarais
and
began
to
tell
shooting
stories
and
peasants
tales
which
he
did
not
finish
i
am
in
a
funk
said
nanteuil
and
you
monsieur
marc
do
you
feel
qualms
in
the
stomach
he
denied
feeling
any
anxiety
she
insisted
now
confess
that
you
wish
it
were
all
over
well
since
you
insist
perhaps
i
would
rather
it
were
over
whereupon
socrates
with
a
simple
expression
and
in
a
quiet
voice
asked
him
the
following
question
do
you
not
believe
that
what
must
be
accomplished
has
already
been
accomplished
and
has
been
accomplished
from
all
time
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
added
if
the
world
phenomena
reach
our
consciousness
in
succession
we
must
not
conclude
from
that
that
they
are
really
successive
and
we
have
still
fewer
reasons
to
believe
that
they
are
produced
at
the
moment
when
we
perceive
them
that
obvious
said
constantin
marc
who
had
not
listened
the
universe
continued
the
doctor
appears
to
us
perpetually
imperfect
and
we
are
all
under
the
illusion
that
it
is
perpetually
completing
itself
since
we
perceive
phenomena
successively
we
actually
believe
that
they
follow
one
another
we
imagine
that
those
which
we
no
longer
see
are
in
the
past
and
those
which
we
do
not
yet
see
are
in
the
future
but
it
is
possible
to
conceive
beings
built
in
such
fashion
that
they
perceive
simultaneously
what
we
regard
as
the
past
and
the
future
we
may
conceive
beings
who
perceive
phenomena
in
a
retrograde
order
and
see
them
unroll
themselves
from
our
future
to
our
past
animals
disposing
of
space
otherwise
than
ourselves
and
able
for
instance
to
move
at
a
speed
greater
than
that
of
light
would
conceive
an
idea
of
the
succession
of
phenomena
which
would
differ
greatly
from
our
own
if
only
durville
is
not
going
to
rag
me
on
the
stage
exclaimed
félicie
while
madame
michon
was
putting
on
her
stockings
under
her
skirt
constantin
marc
assured
her
that
durville
did
not
even
dream
of
any
such
thing
and
begged
her
not
to
be
uneasy
and
socrates
resumed
his
discourse
we
ourselves
of
a
clear
night
when
we
gaze
at
spica
virginis
which
is
throbbing
above
the
top
of
a
poplar
can
see
at
one
and
the
same
time
that
which
was
and
that
which
is
and
it
may
be
said
with
equal
truth
that
we
see
that
which
is
and
that
which
will
be
for
if
the
star
such
as
it
appears
to
us
represents
the
past
as
compared
with
the
tree
the
tree
constitutes
the
future
as
compared
with
the
star
yet
the
star
which
from
afar
shows
us
its
tiny
fiery
countenance
not
as
it
is
but
as
it
was
in
the
time
of
our
youth
perhaps
even
before
our
birth
and
the
whose
young
leaves
are
trembling
in
the
fresh
night
air
come
together
within
us
in
the
same
moment
of
time
and
to
us
are
present
simultaneously
we
say
of
a
thing
that
it
is
in
the
present
when
we
have
a
precise
perception
of
it
we
say
that
it
is
in
the
past
when
we
preserve
but
an
indistinct
image
of
it
a
thing
may
have
been
accomplished
millions
of
years
ago
yet
if
it
makes
the
strongest
possible
impression
upon
us
it
will
not
be
for
us
a
thing
of
the
past
it
will
be
present
the
order
in
which
things
revolve
in
the
depths
of
the
universe
is
unknown
to
us
we
know
only
the
order
of
our
perceptions
to
believe
that
the
future
does
not
exist
because
we
do
not
know
it
is
like
believing
that
a
book
is
not
finished
because
we
have
not
finished
reading
it
the
doctor
paused
for
a
moment
and
nanteuil
in
the
silence
which
followed
heard
the
sound
of
her
heart
beating
she
exclaimed
continue
my
dear
socrates
continue
i
beg
you
if
you
only
knew
how
much
good
you
do
me
by
talking
you
think
that
i
am
not
listening
to
a
word
you
say
but
it
distracts
me
to
hear
you
talking
of
things
it
makes
me
feel
that
there
is
something
else
besides
my
entrance
it
prevents
me
from
giving
way
to
the
blues
talk
about
anything
you
like
but
do
not
stop
the
wise
socrates
who
had
doubtless
anticipated
the
benign
influence
which
his
speech
was
exerting
over
the
actress
resumed
his
lecture
the
universe
is
constructed
inevitably
as
a
triangle
of
which
two
angles
and
one
side
are
given
future
things
are
determined
they
are
from
that
moment
finished
they
are
as
if
they
existed
indeed
they
exist
already
they
exist
to
such
a
degree
that
we
know
them
in
part
and
if
that
part
is
infinitesimal
in
proportion
to
their
immensity
it
is
none
the
less
very
appreciable
in
proportion
to
the
part
of
accomplished
things
of
which
we
can
have
any
knowledge
it
is
permissible
to
say
that
for
us
the
future
is
not
much
more
obscure
than
the
past
we
know
that
generations
will
follow
generations
in
labour
joy
and
suffering
i
look
beyond
the
duration
of
the
human
race
i
see
the
constellations
slowly
changing
in
the
heavens
those
forms
of
theirs
which
seem
immutable
i
see
the
wain
unharnessed
from
its
ancient
team
the
shield
of
orion
broken
in
twain
sirius
extinguished
we
know
that
the
sun
will
rise
and
that
for
a
long
time
to
come
it
will
rise
every
morning
amid
the
dense
clouds
or
in
light
mists
adolphe
meunier
entered
discreetly
on
tiptoe
the
doctor
grasped
his
hand
warmly
good
day
monsieur
meunier
we
can
see
next
month
new
moon
we
do
not
see
her
as
distinctly
as
new
moon
because
we
do
not
know
in
what
grey
or
ruddy
sky
she
will
reveal
her
old
over
my
roof
amid
the
capped
with
pointed
hats
and
romantic
hoods
to
the
gaze
of
the
amorous
cats
but
this
coming
rising
of
the
moon
if
we
were
expert
enough
to
know
it
in
advance
in
its
most
minute
particulars
every
one
of
which
is
essential
we
should
conceive
as
clear
an
idea
of
the
night
whereof
i
speak
as
of
the
night
now
with
us
both
would
be
equally
present
to
us
the
knowledge
that
we
have
of
the
facts
is
the
sole
reason
which
leads
us
to
believe
in
their
reality
we
know
that
certain
facts
are
bound
to
occur
we
must
therefore
believe
them
to
be
real
and
if
they
are
real
they
are
realized
it
is
therefore
credible
my
dear
constantin
marc
that
your
play
has
been
played
a
thousand
years
ago
or
half
an
hour
ago
which
comes
absolutely
to
the
same
thing
it
is
credible
that
we
have
all
been
dead
for
some
time
past
think
it
and
your
mind
will
be
at
rest
constantin
marc
who
had
paid
scant
attention
to
his
remarks
and
who
did
not
perceive
their
relevance
or
their
propriety
answered
in
a
somewhat
irritable
tone
that
all
that
was
to
be
found
in
bossuet
in
bossuet
exclaimed
the
indignant
physician
i
challenge
you
to
show
me
anything
resembling
it
in
his
works
bossuet
knew
nothing
of
philosophy
nanteuil
turned
to
the
doctor
she
was
wearing
a
big
lawn
bonnet
with
a
tall
round
coif
it
was
bound
tightly
upon
her
head
with
a
wide
blue
ribbon
and
its
lappets
one
above
another
fell
on
either
side
of
her
face
shading
her
forehead
and
cheeks
she
had
transformed
herself
into
a
fiery
blonde
hair
fell
in
curls
about
her
shoulders
an
organdie
neckerchief
was
crossed
over
her
bosom
and
held
at
the
waist
by
a
broad
purple
girdle
her
white
and
pink
striped
petticoat
which
flowed
as
though
wet
and
clinging
from
the
somewhat
high
waist
made
her
appear
very
tall
she
looked
like
a
figure
in
a
dream
delage
too
she
said
rags
one
in
the
most
rotten
way
have
you
heard
what
he
did
to
they
were
playing
together
in
femmes
he
put
an
egg
into
her
hand
on
the
stage
she
could
get
rid
of
it
until
the
end
of
the
act
on
hearing
the
call
boy
summons
she
went
downstairs
followed
by
constantin
marc
they
heard
the
roar
of
the
house
the
mutterings
of
the
monster
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
they
were
entering
into
the
flaming
mouth
of
the
apocalyptic
beast
was
favourably
received
coming
at
the
end
of
the
season
with
little
hope
of
a
long
run
it
found
favour
with
all
by
the
middle
of
the
first
act
the
public
were
conscious
of
the
style
the
poetry
and
here
and
there
the
obscurities
of
the
play
thenceforward
they
respected
it
pretended
to
enjoy
it
and
wished
they
could
understand
it
they
forgave
the
play
its
slight
dramatic
value
it
was
literary
and
for
once
the
style
found
acceptance
constantin
marc
as
yet
knew
no
one
in
paris
he
had
invited
to
the
theatre
three
or
four
landed
proprietors
from
the
vivarais
who
sat
blushing
in
the
stalls
in
their
white
ties
rolled
their
round
eyes
and
did
not
dare
to
applaud
as
he
had
no
friends
nobody
dreamt
of
spoiling
his
success
and
even
in
the
corridors
there
were
those
who
set
his
talent
above
that
of
other
dramatists
greatly
excited
nevertheless
he
wandered
from
to
or
collapsed
into
a
chair
at
the
back
of
the
director
he
was
worrying
about
the
critics
set
your
mind
at
rest
romilly
told
him
they
will
say
of
your
play
the
good
or
bad
things
they
think
of
pradel
and
for
the
time
being
they
think
more
ill
than
good
of
him
adolphe
meunier
informed
him
with
a
pale
smile
that
the
house
was
a
good
one
and
that
the
critics
thought
the
play
showed
very
careful
writing
he
expected
in
return
a
few
complimentary
words
concerning
his
et
but
it
did
not
enter
constantin
head
to
vouchsafe
them
romilly
shook
his
head
we
must
look
forward
to
slatings
monsieur
meunier
knows
it
well
the
press
has
shown
itself
ferociously
unjust
to
him
alas
sighed
meunier
they
will
never
say
as
many
hard
things
about
us
as
were
said
of
shakespeare
and
molière
nanteuil
had
a
great
success
which
was
marked
less
by
vociferous
calls
before
the
curtain
than
by
the
deeper
and
more
discreet
approval
of
discriminating
playgoers
she
had
revealed
qualities
with
which
she
had
not
hitherto
been
credited
purity
of
diction
nobility
of
pose
and
a
proud
modest
grace
on
the
stage
during
the
last
interval
the
minister
congratulated
her
in
person
this
was
a
sign
that
the
public
was
favourably
disposed
for
ministers
never
express
individual
opinions
behind
the
grand
master
of
the
university
pressed
a
flattering
crowd
of
public
officials
society
folk
and
dramatic
authors
with
arms
extended
toward
her
like
they
all
simultaneously
assured
her
of
their
admiration
and
madame
doulce
stifled
by
their
numbers
left
on
the
buttons
of
the
men
garments
shreds
of
her
countless
adornments
of
cotton
lace
the
last
act
was
nanteuil
triumph
she
obtained
better
things
from
the
public
than
tears
and
shouts
she
won
from
all
eyes
that
moist
yet
tearless
gaze
from
every
breast
that
deep
yet
almost
silent
murmur
which
beauty
alone
has
power
to
compel
she
felt
that
she
had
grown
immeasurably
in
a
single
instant
and
when
the
curtain
fell
she
whispered
this
time
i
done
it
she
was
unrobing
herself
in
her
which
was
filled
with
baskets
of
orchids
bouquets
of
roses
and
bunches
of
lilac
when
a
telegram
was
brought
to
her
she
tore
it
open
it
was
a
message
from
the
hague
containing
these
words
my
heartfelt
congratulations
on
your
undoubted
success
robert
just
as
she
finished
reading
it
trublet
entered
the
she
flung
her
arms
burning
with
joy
and
fatigue
round
his
neck
she
drew
him
to
her
warm
moist
bosom
and
planted
on
his
meditative
face
a
smacking
kiss
from
her
intoxicated
lips
socrates
who
was
a
wise
man
took
the
kiss
as
a
gift
from
the
gods
knowing
full
well
that
it
was
not
intended
for
him
but
was
dedicated
to
glory
and
to
love
nanteuil
realized
herself
that
in
her
intoxication
she
had
perhaps
charged
her
lips
with
too
ardent
a
breath
for
throwing
her
arms
apart
she
exclaimed
it
ca
be
helped
i
am
so
happy
chapter
xx
at
easter
an
event
of
great
importance
increased
her
joy
she
was
engaged
at
the
for
some
time
past
without
mentioning
the
subject
she
had
been
trying
for
this
engagement
her
mother
had
helped
her
in
the
steps
she
had
taken
madame
nanteuil
was
lovable
now
that
she
was
loved
she
now
wore
straight
corsets
and
petticoats
that
she
could
display
anywhere
she
frequented
the
offices
of
the
ministry
and
it
is
said
that
being
solicited
by
the
of
a
department
in
the
she
had
yielded
with
very
good
grace
at
least
so
pradel
said
he
would
exclaim
joyfully
you
would
recognize
her
now
mother
nanteuil
she
has
become
most
desirable
and
i
like
her
better
than
her
little
vixen
of
a
daughter
she
has
a
better
disposition
like
the
rest
of
them
félicie
had
disdained
despised
disparaged
the
she
had
said
as
all
the
others
did
i
should
hardly
care
to
get
into
that
house
and
no
sooner
did
she
belong
to
it
than
she
was
filled
with
proud
and
joyful
exultation
what
increased
her
pleasure
twofold
was
that
she
was
to
make
her
debut
in
des
she
already
studying
the
part
of
agnès
with
an
obscure
old
professor
monsieur
maxime
of
whom
she
thought
highly
because
he
was
acquainted
with
all
the
traditions
of
the
stage
at
night
she
was
playing
cécile
in
and
she
was
living
in
a
feverish
turmoil
of
work
she
received
a
letter
in
which
robert
de
ligny
informed
her
that
he
was
returning
to
paris
during
his
stay
at
the
hague
he
had
made
certain
experiments
which
had
proved
to
him
the
strength
of
his
love
for
félicie
he
had
had
women
who
were
reported
to
be
pretty
and
pleasing
but
neither
madame
bourmdernoot
of
brussels
tall
and
fresh
looking
nor
the
sisters
van
cruysen
milliners
on
the
vijver
nor
suzette
berger
of
the
then
on
tour
through
northern
europe
had
given
him
a
sense
of
pleasure
in
its
completeness
when
in
their
company
he
had
regretted
félicie
and
had
discovered
that
of
all
women
he
desired
her
alone
had
it
not
been
for
madame
bourmdernoot
the
sisters
van
cruysen
and
suzette
berger
he
would
never
have
known
how
priceless
félicie
nanteuil
was
to
him
if
one
must
be
literal
it
may
be
argued
that
he
was
unfaithful
to
her
that
is
the
correct
expression
there
are
others
which
come
to
the
same
thing
and
which
are
not
such
good
form
but
if
one
looks
into
the
matter
more
closely
he
had
not
deceived
her
he
had
sought
her
he
had
sought
her
out
of
herself
and
had
learned
that
he
would
find
her
in
herself
alone
in
his
futile
wisdom
he
was
almost
angered
and
alarmed
he
was
uneasy
at
having
to
stake
the
multitude
of
his
desires
upon
so
slender
a
substance
in
so
unique
and
fragile
a
vessel
and
he
loved
félicie
all
the
more
because
he
loved
her
with
a
certain
depth
of
rage
and
hatred
on
the
very
day
of
his
arrival
in
paris
he
made
an
appointment
with
her
in
a
bachelor
flat
which
a
rich
colleague
in
the
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
had
placed
at
his
disposal
it
was
situated
in
the
avenue
de
on
the
of
an
house
and
consisted
of
a
couple
of
small
rooms
hung
with
a
design
of
suns
with
brown
hearts
and
golden
rays
which
rose
uniform
peaceful
and
shadowless
on
the
cheerful
wall
the
rooms
were
modern
in
style
the
furniture
was
of
a
pale
green
decorated
with
flowering
branches
its
outlines
followed
the
gentle
curves
of
the
liliaceous
plants
and
assumed
something
of
the
tender
feeling
of
moist
vegetation
the
leant
slightly
forward
in
its
frame
of
bulbous
plants
of
supple
form
terminating
in
closed
corollas
and
in
this
frame
the
mirror
had
the
coolness
of
water
a
white
bearskin
lay
stretched
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
you
you
it
you
was
all
she
could
say
she
saw
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
shining
and
heavy
with
desire
and
while
she
gazed
at
him
a
cloud
gathered
before
her
eyes
the
subtle
fire
of
her
blood
the
burning
of
her
loins
the
warm
breath
of
her
lungs
the
fiery
colour
of
her
face
were
all
blended
in
her
mouth
and
she
pressed
on
her
lover
lips
a
long
long
kiss
a
kiss
pregnant
with
all
these
fires
and
as
fresh
as
a
flower
in
the
dew
they
asked
one
another
twenty
things
at
a
time
and
their
questions
intermingled
were
you
wretched
robert
when
you
were
away
from
me
so
you
are
making
your
début
at
the
comédie
is
the
hague
a
pretty
place
yes
a
quiet
little
town
red
grey
yellow
houses
with
stepped
gables
green
shutters
and
geraniums
at
the
windows
what
did
you
do
there
not
much
i
walked
round
the
vijver
you
did
not
go
with
women
i
should
hope
no
upon
my
word
how
pretty
you
are
my
darling
are
you
well
again
now
yes
i
am
cured
and
in
sudden
entreaty
she
said
robert
i
love
you
do
not
leave
me
if
you
were
to
leave
me
i
know
for
certain
i
could
never
take
another
lover
and
what
would
become
of
me
you
know
that
i
ca
do
without
love
he
replied
brusquely
in
a
harsh
voice
that
he
loved
her
only
too
well
that
he
thought
of
nothing
but
of
her
i
going
crazy
with
it
his
harshness
delighted
and
reassured
her
better
than
the
nerveless
tenderness
of
oaths
and
promises
could
have
done
she
smiled
and
began
to
undress
herself
generously
when
do
you
make
your
début
at
the
comédie
this
very
month
she
opened
her
little
bag
and
took
from
it
together
with
her
her
call
for
the
rehearsal
which
she
held
out
to
robert
it
was
a
source
of
unending
delight
to
her
to
gaze
admiringly
at
this
document
because
it
bore
the
heading
of
the
comédie
with
the
remote
and
date
of
its
foundation
you
see
i
make
my
début
as
agnès
in
des
it
a
fine
part
i
believe
you
and
while
she
was
undressing
the
lines
surged
to
her
lips
and
she
whispered
them
moi
blessé
tout
étonnée
oui
blessé
mais
blessé
tout
de
bon
et
vous
vîtes
au
balcon
las
qui
pourrait
lui
en
avoir
été
cause
sur
lui
sans
y
penser
choir
quelque
chose
you
see
i
have
not
grown
thin
non
vos
yeux
ont
fait
ce
coup
fatal
et
de
leurs
regards
venu
tout
son
mal
if
anything
i
am
a
little
plumper
but
not
too
much
hé
mon
dieu
ma
surprise
est
sans
seconde
mes
yeux
du
mal
pour
en
donner
au
monde
he
listened
to
the
lines
with
pleasure
if
on
the
one
hand
he
did
not
know
much
more
of
the
literature
of
bygone
days
or
of
french
tradition
than
his
youthful
contemporaries
he
had
more
taste
and
more
lively
interests
and
like
all
frenchmen
he
loved
molière
understood
him
and
felt
him
profoundly
it
delightful
he
said
now
come
to
me
she
let
her
chemise
slip
downwards
with
a
calm
and
beneficent
grace
but
because
she
wished
to
make
herself
desired
and
because
she
loved
comedy
she
began
agnès
narrative
sur
le
balcon
à
travailler
au
frais
lorsque
je
vis
passer
sous
les
arbres
un
jeune
homme
bien
fait
qui
rencontrant
ma
vue
he
called
her
and
drew
her
to
him
she
glided
from
his
arms
and
advancing
toward
the
mirror
she
continued
to
recite
and
act
before
the
glass
humble
révérence
aussitôt
me
salue
bending
her
knee
at
first
slightly
then
lower
then
with
her
left
leg
brought
forward
and
her
right
thrown
back
she
curtsied
deeply
moi
pour
ne
point
manquer
à
la
civilité
je
fis
la
révérence
aussi
de
mon
côté
he
called
her
more
urgently
but
she
dropped
a
second
curtsy
the
pauses
of
which
she
accentuated
with
amusing
precision
and
she
went
on
reciting
and
dropping
curtsies
at
the
places
indicated
by
the
text
and
by
the
traditions
of
the
stage
soudain
il
me
refait
une
autre
révérence
moi
refais
de
même
une
autre
en
diligence
et
lui
troisième
aussitôt
repartant
troisième
aussi
repars
à
she
executed
every
detail
of
stage
business
seriously
and
conscientiously
taking
pains
to
give
a
perfect
rendering
her
poses
some
of
which
were
disconcerting
requiring
as
they
did
a
skirt
to
explain
them
were
almost
all
pretty
while
all
were
interesting
inasmuch
as
they
brought
into
relief
the
firm
muscles
under
the
soft
envelope
of
a
young
body
and
revealed
at
every
movement
correspondences
and
harmonies
which
are
not
commonly
observed
when
clothing
her
nudity
with
the
propriety
of
her
attitudes
and
the
ingenuousness
of
her
expressions
she
was
the
incarnation
through
mere
chance
and
caprice
of
a
gem
of
art
an
allegory
of
innocence
in
the
style
of
allegrain
or
clodion
and
the
great
lines
of
the
comedy
rang
out
with
delicious
purity
from
this
animated
figurine
robert
enthralled
in
spite
of
himself
suffered
her
to
go
on
to
the
very
end
what
entertained
him
above
all
was
that
the
most
public
of
all
things
a
stage
scene
should
be
presented
to
him
in
so
private
and
secret
a
fashion
and
while
watching
the
ceremonious
actions
of
this
girl
in
all
her
nudity
he
was
at
the
same
time
revelling
in
the
philosophical
pleasure
of
discovering
how
dignity
is
produced
in
the
best
social
circles
il
passe
vient
repasse
et
toujours
de
plus
belle
me
fait
à
chaque
fois
une
révérence
nouvelle
et
moi
qui
tous
ses
tours
fixement
regardais
nouvelle
révérence
aussi
je
lui
rendais
in
the
meantime
she
admired
in
the
mirror
her
breasts
her
supple
waist
her
arms
a
trifle
slender
round
and
tapering
and
her
smooth
beautiful
knees
and
seeing
all
this
subservient
to
the
fine
art
of
comedy
she
became
animated
and
exalted
a
slight
flush
like
rouge
tinted
her
cheeks
tant
que
si
sur
ce
point
la
nuit
ne
fût
venue
toujours
comme
cela
je
me
serais
tenue
ne
voulaut
point
céder
ni
recevoir
me
pût
estimer
moins
civile
que
lui
he
called
to
her
from
the
bed
where
he
was
lying
on
his
elbow
now
come
whereupon
full
of
animation
and
with
heightened
colour
she
exclaimed
do
you
think
that
i
too
love
you
she
flung
herself
beside
her
lover
supple
and
wholly
surrendered
she
threw
back
her
head
offering
to
his
kisses
her
eyes
veiled
with
shadowy
lashes
and
her
lips
from
which
gleamed
a
moist
flash
of
white
of
a
sudden
she
started
to
her
knees
her
staring
eyes
were
filled
with
unspeakable
terror
a
hoarse
scream
escaped
from
her
throat
followed
by
a
wail
as
long
drawn
out
and
gentle
as
an
organ
note
turning
her
head
she
pointed
to
the
white
fur
spread
out
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
there
there
he
is
lying
there
like
a
crouching
dog
with
a
hole
in
his
head
he
is
looking
at
me
with
the
blood
trickling
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
her
eyes
wide
open
rolled
up
showing
the
whites
her
body
stretched
backward
like
a
bow
and
when
it
had
recovered
its
suppleness
she
fell
as
if
dead
he
bathed
her
temples
with
cold
water
and
brought
her
back
to
consciousness
in
a
childlike
voice
she
whimpered
that
every
joint
in
her
body
was
broken
feeling
a
burning
sensation
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
she
looked
and
saw
that
the
palm
was
cut
and
bleeding
she
said
it
my
nails
they
gone
into
my
hand
see
my
nails
are
full
of
blood
she
thanked
him
tenderly
for
his
ministrations
and
apologized
sweetly
for
causing
him
so
much
trouble
it
was
not
for
that
you
came
was
it
she
tried
to
smile
and
looked
around
her
it
nice
here
her
gaze
met
the
call
to
rehearsal
lying
open
on
the
bedside
table
and
she
sighed
what
is
the
use
of
my
being
a
great
actress
if
i
am
not
happy
without
realizing
it
she
was
repeating
word
for
word
what
chevalier
had
said
when
she
rejected
his
advances
then
raising
her
still
stupefied
head
from
the
pillow
in
which
it
had
lain
buried
she
turned
her
mournful
eyes
toward
her
lover
and
said
to
him
resignedly
we
did
indeed
love
each
other
we
two
it
is
over
we
shall
never
again
belong
to
each
other
no
never

forbids
