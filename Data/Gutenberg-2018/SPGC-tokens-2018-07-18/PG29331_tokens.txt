had

illington
been
part
of
an
empire
instead
of
one
of
the
most
important
cities
in
the
greatest
republic
in
the
world
the
cry
the
king
is
dead
long
live
the
king
might
well
have
resounded
through
its
streets
on
that
bleak
november
morning
when
pennington
lawton
was
found
dead
seated
quietly
in
his
by
the
hearth
in
the
library
where
so
many
vast
deals
of
national
import
had
been
first
conceived
and
the
details
arranged
which
had
carried
them
on
and
on
to
brilliant
consummation
lawton
the
magnate
the
supreme
power
in
the
financial
world
of
the
whole
country
had
been
suddenly
cut
down
in
his
prime
the
news
of
his
passing
traveled
more
quickly
than
the
extras
which
rolled
damp
from
the
presses
could
convey
it
through
the
avenues
and
alleys
of
the
city
whose
wealthiest
citizen
he
had
been
and
through
the
highways
and
byways
of
the
country
which
his
marvelous
mentality
and
finesse
had
so
manifestly
strengthened
in
its
position
as
a
world
power
at
the
banks
and
trust
companies
there
were
directors
meetings
where
men
sat
about
long
mahogany
tables
and
talked
constrainedly
about
the
immediate
future
and
the
vast
changes
which
the
death
of
this
great
man
would
necessarily
bring
in
the
political
clubs
his
passing
was
discussed
with
bated
breath
at
the
hospitals
and
charitable
institutions
which
he
had
so
generously
helped
to
maintain
in
the
art
clubs
and
museums
in
the
cosmopolitan
opera
house
in
the
founding
of
which
he
had
been
leading
spirit
and
unfailingly
thereafter
its
most
generous
contributor
he
was
mourned
with
a
sincerity
no
less
deep
because
of
its
admixture
of
in
aristocratic
there
were
whispers
over
the
the
luck
of
ramon
hamilton
the
rising
young
lawyer
whose
engagement
to
anita
lawton
daughter
and
sole
heiress
of
the
dead
financier
had
just
been
announced
was
remarked
upon
with
the
frankness
of
envy
left
momentarily
unguarded
by
the
sudden
shock
for
three
days
pennington
lawton
lay
in
simple
but
veritable
state
telegrams
poured
in
from
the
highest
representatives
of
state
clergy
and
finance
then
while
the
banks
and
charitable
institutions
momentarily
closed
their
doors
and
flags
throughout
the
city
were
lowered
in
respect
to
the
man
who
had
gone
the
funeral
procession
wound
its
solemn
way
from
the
aristocratic
church
of
james
to
the
graveyard
the
last
extras
were
issued
detailing
the
service
the
last
obituaries
printed
the
final
pæans
of
praise
were
sung
and
the
world
went
on
its
way
during
the
two
days
thereafter
multitudinous
affairs
of
more
imperative
public
import
were
brought
to
light
a
celebrated
murder
was
committed
a
notorious
band
of
criminals
was
rounded
up
a
political
boss
toppled
and
fell
from
his
pedestal
a
diplomatic
scandal
of
effect
was
unearthed
and
in
the
press
of
passing
events
the
fact
that
lawton
had
been
eliminated
from
the
scheme
of
things
faded
into
comparative
insignificance
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
general
public
in
the
great
house
on
belleair
avenue
which
the
man
who
was
gone
had
called
home
a
tall
slender
young
girl
sat
listlessly
conversing
with
a
pompous
little
man
whose
clerical
garb
proclaimed
the
reason
for
his
coming
the
girl
sable
garments
pathetically
betrayed
her
youth
and
in
her
soft
eyes
was
the
pained
and
wounded
look
of
a
child
face
to
face
with
its
first
comprehended
sorrow
the
rev
franklin
laid
an
obsequious
hand
upon
her
arm
the
lord
gave
and
the
lord
hath
taken
away
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
anita
lawton
shivered
slightly
and
raised
a
trembling
protesting
hand
please
she
said
softly
i
know
i
heard
you
say
that
at
james
two
days
ago
i
try
to
believe
to
think
that
in
some
inscrutable
way
god
meant
it
for
the
best
when
he
took
my
father
so
ruthlessly
from
me
with
no
premonition
no
sign
of
warning
it
is
hard
franklin
i
can
not
coordinate
my
thoughts
just
yet
you
must
give
me
a
little
time
the
minister
bent
his
short
body
still
lower
before
her
my
dear
child
do
you
remember
also
a
later
prayer
in
the
same
service
unconsciously
he
assumed
the
full
rich
rounded
pulpit
tones
which
were
habitual
with
him
thou
hast
been
our
refuge
from
one
generation
to
another
before
the
mountains
were
brought
forth
or
ever
the
earth
and
world
were
made
a
low
knocking
upon
the
door
interrupted
him
and
the
butler
appeared
rockamore
and
mallowe
anita
lawton
read
aloud
from
the
cards
he
presented
oh
i
ca
see
them
now
tell
them
wilkes
that
my
minister
is
with
me
and
they
must
forgive
me
for
denying
myself
to
them
the
butler
retired
and
the
rev
franklin
at
the
mention
of
two
of
the
most
prominent
and
influential
men
in
the
city
since
the
death
of
lawton
turned
bulging
inquiring
eyes
upon
the
girl
my
dear
child
is
it
wise
for
you
to
refuse
to
see
two
of
your
father
best
friends
you
will
need
their
help
their
kindness
a
woman
alone
in
the
world
no
matter
how
exalted
her
position
needs
friends
mallowe
is
not
one
of
my
parishioners
but
i
understand
that
as
president
of
the
street
railways
he
was
closely
associated
with
your
dear
father
in
many
affairs
of
finance
rockamore
i
know
to
be
a
man
of
almost
unlimited
power
in
the
world
in
which
lawton
moved
should
you
not
see
them
remember
that
you
are
under
my
protection
in
every
way
of
course
but
since
our
heavenly
father
has
seen
fit
to
take
unto
himself
your
dear
one
i
feel
that
it
would
be
advisable
for
you
to
place
yourself
under
the
temporal
guidance
of
those
whom
he
trusted
at
any
rate
for
the
time
being
oh
i
feel
that
they
were
my
father
friends
but
not
mine
since
mother
and
my
little
sister
and
brother
were
lost
at
sea
so
many
years
ago
i
have
learned
to
depend
wholly
upon
my
father
who
was
more
comrade
than
parent
then
as
you
know
i
met
ramon
hamilton
and
of
course
i
trust
him
as
implicitly
as
i
must
trust
you
but
although
on
many
occasions
i
assisted
my
father
to
receive
his
financial
confrères
on
a
social
basis
i
can
not
feel
at
a
time
like
this
that
i
care
to
talk
with
any
except
those
who
are
nearest
and
dearest
to
me
but
suppose
they
have
come
not
wholly
to
offer
you
consolation
but
to
confer
with
you
upon
some
business
matters
upon
which
it
would
be
advantageous
for
you
to
inform
yourself
your
grief
and
desire
for
seclusion
are
most
natural
under
the
circumstances
but
one
must
sometimes
consider
earthly
things
also
the
minister
evidently
eager
desire
to
be
present
at
an
interview
with
the
great
men
and
to
place
himself
on
a
more
familiar
footing
with
them
was
so
obvious
that
anita
gesture
of
dissent
held
also
something
of
repugnance
i
could
not
franklin
perhaps
later
when
the
first
shock
has
passed
but
not
yet
you
understand
that
i
like
them
both
most
cordially
those
whom
father
trusted
must
be
men
of
sterling
worth
but
just
now
i
feel
as
must
an
animal
which
has
been
beaten
i
want
to
creep
off
into
a
dark
and
silent
place
until
my
misery
dulls
a
little
you
have
borne
up
wonderfully
well
dear
child
under
the
severe
shock
of
this
tragedy
franklin
and
i
have
remarked
upon
it
you
have
exhibited
the
same
and
strength
of
character
which
made
your
father
the
man
he
was
franklin
arose
from
his
chair
with
a
sigh
which
was
not
altogether
perfunctory
think
well
over
what
i
have
said
try
to
realize
that
your
only
consolation
and
strength
in
this
hour
of
your
deepest
sorrow
come
from
on
high
and
believe
that
if
you
take
your
poor
crushed
heart
to
the
throne
of
grace
it
shall
be
healed
that
has
been
promised
us
think
also
of
what
i
have
just
said
to
you
concerning
your
father
associates
and
when
next
they
call
as
they
will
of
course
do
very
shortly
try
to
receive
them
with
your
usual
gracious
charms
and
should
they
offer
you
any
advice
upon
worldly
matters
which
we
must
not
permit
ourselves
to
neglect
send
for
me
i
will
leave
you
now
franklin
will
call
upon
you
try
to
be
brave
and
calm
and
pray
for
the
guidance
which
will
be
vouchsafed
you
should
you
ask
it
frankly
and
freely
anita
lawton
gave
him
her
hand
and
accompanied
him
in
silence
to
the
door
there
with
a
few
gentle
words
she
dismissed
him
and
when
the
sound
of
his
measured
footsteps
had
diminished
she
closed
the
door
with
a
little
gasp
of
half
relief
and
turned
to
the
window
it
had
been
an
effort
to
her
to
see
and
talk
with
her
spiritual
adviser
whose
hypocrisy
she
had
vaguely
felt
if
only
ramon
had
come
ramon
whose
wife
she
would
be
in
so
short
a
time
and
who
must
now
be
father
as
well
as
husband
to
her
she
glanced
at
the
little
french
clock
on
the
mantel
he
was
late
he
had
promised
to
be
there
at
four
as
she
parted
the
heavy
curtains
the
telephone
upon
her
father
desk
in
the
corner
shrilled
sharply
when
she
took
the
receiver
off
the
hook
the
voice
of
her
lover
came
to
the
girl
as
clearly
tenderly
as
if
he
himself
stood
beside
her
anita
dear
may
i
come
to
you
now
oh
please
do
ramon
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
franklin
called
this
afternoon
and
while
he
was
here
with
me
rockamore
and
mallowe
came
but
i
could
not
see
them
there
is
something
i
feel
i
must
talk
over
with
you
she
hung
up
the
receiver
with
a
little
sigh
and
for
the
first
time
in
days
a
faint
suspicion
of
a
smile
lightened
her
face
as
she
turned
away
however
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
great
leather
chair
by
the
hearth
and
her
expression
changed
as
she
gave
an
uncontrollable
shudder
it
was
in
that
chair
her
father
had
been
found
on
that
fateful
morning
about
a
week
ago
clad
still
in
the
of
the
previous
evening
a
faint
introspective
smile
upon
his
keen
inscrutable
face
his
eyes
wide
with
a
politely
inquiring
stare
as
if
he
had
looked
upon
things
which
until
then
had
been
withheld
from
his
vision
she
walked
over
to
the
chair
and
laid
her
hand
where
his
head
had
rested
then
all
at
once
the
tension
within
her
seemed
to
snap
and
she
flung
herself
within
its
capacious
arms
in
a
torrent
of
tears
the
first
she
had
shed
it
was
thus
that
ramon
hamilton
found
her
on
his
arrival
twenty
minutes
later
and
without
ado
he
gathered
her
up
carried
her
to
the
and
made
her
cry
out
her
heart
upon
his
shoulder
when
she
was
somewhat
quieted
he
said
to
her
gently
dearest
why
will
you
insist
upon
coming
to
this
room
of
all
others
at
least
just
for
a
little
time
the
memories
here
will
only
add
to
your
suffering
i
do
know
i
ca
explain
it
that
chair
there
in
which
poor
father
was
found
has
a
peculiar
dreadful
fascination
for
me
i
have
heard
that
murderers
invariably
return
sooner
or
later
to
the
scene
of
their
crime
may
we
not
also
have
the
same
desire
to
stay
close
to
the
place
whence
some
one
we
love
has
departed
you
are
morbid
dear
bring
your
maid
and
come
to
my
mother
house
for
a
little
as
she
has
repeatedly
asked
you
to
do
it
will
make
it
so
much
easier
for
you
perhaps
it
would
your
mother
has
been
so
very
kind
and
yet
i
feel
that
i
must
remain
here
that
there
is
something
for
me
to
do
i
do
understand
what
do
you
mean
dearest
she
turned
swiftly
and
placed
her
hands
upon
his
broad
shoulders
her
childish
eyes
were
steely
with
an
intensity
of
purpose
hitherto
foreign
to
them
ramon
there
is
something
i
have
not
told
you
or
any
one
but
i
feel
that
the
time
has
come
for
me
to
speak
it
is
not
nervousness
or
imagination
it
is
a
fact
which
occurred
on
the
night
of
my
death
why
speak
of
it
anita
he
took
her
hands
from
his
shoulders
and
pressed
them
gently
but
with
quiet
strength
it
is
all
over
now
you
know
we
must
not
dwell
too
much
upon
what
is
past
i
shall
have
to
help
you
to
put
it
all
from
your
mind
not
to
forget
but
to
make
your
memories
tender
and
beautiful
but
i
must
speak
of
it
it
will
be
on
my
mind
day
and
night
until
i
have
told
you
ramon
you
dined
with
us
that
night
the
night
before
did
my
father
seem
ill
to
you
of
course
not
i
had
never
known
him
to
be
in
better
health
and
spirits
ramon
glanced
at
her
in
involuntary
surprise
are
you
sure
why
do
you
ask
me
that
you
know
that
may
attack
one
at
any
time
without
warning
anita
sank
upon
the
again
and
leaned
forward
pensively
her
hands
clasped
over
her
knees
you
will
remember
that
after
you
and
father
had
your
coffee
and
cigars
together
in
the
you
both
joined
me
of
course
you
were
playing
the
piano
ramblingly
as
if
your
thoughts
were
far
away
and
you
seemed
nervous
ill
at
ease
i
wondered
about
it
at
the
time
it
was
because
of
father
to
you
he
appeared
in
the
best
of
spirits
as
you
say
but
i
who
knew
him
better
than
any
one
else
on
earth
realized
that
he
was
forcing
himself
to
be
genial
to
take
an
interest
in
what
we
were
saying
for
days
he
had
been
overwrought
and
depressed
as
you
know
he
has
confided
in
me
absolutely
since
i
have
been
old
enough
to
be
a
real
companion
to
him
i
thought
that
i
knew
all
his
business
affairs
those
of
the
last
two
or
three
years
at
least
but
latterly
his
manner
has
puzzled
and
distressed
me
then
while
you
were
in
the
the
telephone
rang
twice
yes
the
calls
were
for
your
father
when
he
was
summoned
to
the
wire
he
immediately
had
the
connection
given
to
him
on
his
private
line
here
in
the
library
after
he
returned
to
the
he
did
seem
slightly
now
that
i
think
of
it
but
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
there
could
have
been
any
serious
trouble
you
know
dearest
ever
since
the
evening
when
he
promised
to
give
you
to
me
he
has
consulted
me
also
to
a
great
extent
about
his
financial
interests
and
i
think
if
any
difficulty
had
arisen
he
would
have
mentioned
it
still
i
am
convinced
that
something
was
on
his
mind
i
tried
to
approach
him
concerning
it
but
he
was
evasive
and
put
me
off
laughingly
you
know
that
father
was
not
the
sort
of
man
whose
confidence
could
be
forced
even
by
those
dearest
to
him
i
had
been
so
worried
about
him
though
that
i
had
a
nervous
headache
and
after
you
left
ramon
i
retired
at
once
an
hour
or
two
later
father
had
a
visitor
that
fact
as
you
know
the
coroner
elicited
from
the
servants
but
it
had
of
course
no
bearing
on
his
death
since
the
caller
was
rockamore
i
heard
his
voice
when
i
opened
the
door
of
my
room
after
ringing
for
my
maid
to
get
some
lavender
salts
i
could
not
sleep
my
headache
grew
worse
and
while
i
was
struggling
against
it
i
heard
rockamore
depart
and
my
father
voice
in
the
hall
after
the
slamming
of
the
front
door
telling
wilkes
to
retire
that
he
would
need
him
no
more
that
night
i
heard
the
butler
footsteps
pass
down
the
hall
and
then
i
rose
and
opened
my
door
again
i
know
why
but
i
felt
that
i
wanted
to
speak
to
father
when
he
came
up
on
his
way
to
bed
anita
paused
and
ramon
in
spite
of
himself
felt
a
thrill
of
puzzled
wonder
at
her
expression
upon
which
a
dawning
look
almost
of
horror
spread
and
grew
but
he
did
not
come
and
after
a
while
i
stole
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
looked
down
there
was
a
low
light
in
the
hall
and
a
brighter
one
from
the
library
the
door
of
which
was
ajar
i
supposed
that
father
was
working
late
over
some
papers
and
i
knew
that
i
must
not
disturb
him
i
crept
back
to
bed
at
last
with
a
sigh
but
left
my
own
door
slightly
open
so
that
if
i
should
happen
to
be
awake
when
he
passed
i
might
call
to
him
presently
however
i
dozed
off
i
do
know
how
long
i
slept
but
i
awakened
to
hear
voices
angry
voices
my
father
and
another
which
i
did
not
recognize
i
got
up
and
by
the
i
saw
that
the
hands
of
the
little
clock
on
my
dresser
pointed
to
nearly
three
i
could
not
imagine
who
would
call
on
father
so
very
late
at
night
and
i
feared
at
first
it
might
be
a
burglar
but
my
common
sense
assured
me
that
father
would
not
stop
to
parley
with
a
burglar
while
i
stood
wondering
father
raised
his
voice
slightly
and
i
caught
one
word
which
he
uttered
ramon
that
word
sounded
to
me
like
why
what
is
it
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
strangely
she
added
hastily
at
his
uncontrollable
start
i
i
am
not
looking
at
you
strangely
dear
it
is
not
possible
that
you
could
have
heard
aright
it
must
have
been
simply
a
fancy
of
yours
born
of
the
state
of
your
nerves
you
could
not
really
have
understood
but
ramon
hamilton
looked
away
from
her
as
he
spoke
with
a
peculiarly
significant
gleam
in
his
candid
eyes
after
a
slight
pause
he
went
on
no
one
in
the
world
could
have
attempted
to
blackmail
your
father
he
was
the
soul
of
honor
and
integrity
as
no
one
knows
better
than
you
why
his
opinion
was
sought
on
every
public
question
you
remember
hearing
of
some
of
the
political
honors
which
he
repeatedly
refused
but
he
could
had
he
wished
have
held
the
highest
office
at
the
disposal
of
the
people
you
must
have
been
mistaken
anita
there
has
never
been
a
reason
for
the
word
to
cross
your
father
lips
i
know
that
i
was
not
mistaken
for
i
heard
more
enough
to
convince
me
that
i
had
been
right
in
my
surmise
father
was
keeping
something
from
me
dear
little
girl
suppose
he
had
been
nothing
of
course
that
could
possibly
reflect
upon
his
integrity
do
misunderstand
me
but
you
are
only
twenty
you
know
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
you
could
quite
comprehend
the
details
of
all
the
varied
business
interests
of
a
man
who
had
virtually
led
the
finances
of
his
country
for
more
than
twenty
years
perhaps
it
was
a
purely
business
matter
i
tell
you
ramon
that
that
man
whoever
he
was
actually
dared
to
threaten
father
when
i
heard
that
word
in
the
angriest
tones
which
i
had
ever
heard
my
father
use
i
did
something
mean
despicable
which
only
my
culminating
anxiety
could
have
induced
me
to
do
i
slipped
on
my
robe
and
slippers
stole
downstairs
and
listened
deliberately
anita
you
should
not
have
done
that
it
was
not
like
you
to
do
so
if
your
father
had
wished
you
to
know
of
this
interview
do
you
think
he
would
have
told
you
perhaps
he
would
have
but
what
opportunity
was
he
given
a
few
hours
later
he
was
found
dead
in
that
chair
over
there
the
chair
in
which
he
sat
while
he
was
talking
with
his
unknown
visitor
the
young
man
sprang
to
his
feet
you
ca
realize
what
you
are
saying
what
you
are
hinting
it
is
unthinkable
if
you
let
these
morbid
fancies
prey
upon
your
mind
you
will
be
really
his
tones
were
full
of
horror
your
father
died
of
the
doctors
and
the
coroner
established
that
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
you
know
any
other
supposition
is
beyond
the
bounds
of
possibility
of
yes
but
might
not
the
sudden
attack
have
been
brought
on
by
his
altercation
with
this
man
his
sudden
rage
controlled
as
it
was
at
the
insults
hurled
at
him
what
insults
anita
tell
me
what
you
heard
when
you
crept
down
the
stairs
you
know
you
can
trust
me
dear
you
must
trust
me
the
man
was
saying
lawton
be
sensible
half
a
loaf
is
better
than
no
bread
there
is
no
blackmail
about
this
even
if
you
choose
to
call
it
so
it
is
an
ordinary
business
proposition
as
you
have
been
told
a
hundred
times
a
damnable
crooked
scheme
as
i
have
told
you
a
hundred
times
and
i
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
this
is
final
father
tones
rang
out
clearly
and
distinctly
quivering
with
suppressed
fury
hands
are
clean
my
financial
operations
have
been
open
and
there
is
no
stain
upon
my
life
or
character
and
i
can
look
every
man
in
the
face
and
tell
him
to
go
where
you
may
go
now
is
that
so
sneered
the
other
man
loudly
then
his
voice
became
insinuatingly
low
about
poor
herbert
his
tones
were
so
indistinct
that
i
could
not
catch
the
name
then
he
went
on
more
defiantly
wife
he
did
finish
the
sentence
ramon
for
father
groaned
suddenly
terribly
as
if
he
were
in
swift
pain
the
man
gave
a
little
sneering
laugh
and
i
could
hear
him
moving
about
in
the
library
whistling
half
under
his
breath
in
sheer
bravado
i
could
not
bear
to
hear
any
more
i
put
my
hands
over
my
ears
and
fled
back
to
my
room
what
could
it
mean
ramon
what
is
this
about
father
and
some
other
man
and
his
wife
which
the
stranger
dared
to
insinuate
reflected
upon
father
integrity
why
should
he
have
groaned
as
if
the
very
mention
of
these
people
hurt
him
inexpressibly
i
do
know
dear
ramon
hamilton
sat
with
his
honest
eyes
still
turned
from
her
you
must
have
been
mistaken
perhaps
you
even
dreamed
it
all
anita
lawton
gave
an
impatient
gesture
i
am
not
quite
the
child
you
think
me
ramon
could
that
man
have
meant
to
insinuate
that
father
in
his
own
advancement
had
trod
upon
and
ruined
some
one
else
as
financiers
have
always
done
could
he
have
meant
that
father
had
driven
this
man
and
his
wife
to
despair
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
it
i
try
to
thrust
it
from
my
thoughts
a
dozen
times
a
day
but
that
groan
from
father
lips
sounded
so
much
like
one
of
remorse
that
hideous
ideas
come
beating
in
on
my
brain
was
my
father
like
other
rich
men
ramon
he
did
not
live
for
money
although
the
successful
manipulation
of
it
was
almost
a
passion
with
him
he
lived
for
me
always
for
me
and
the
good
that
he
would
be
able
to
do
in
this
world
of
course
he
did
darling
no
one
who
knew
him
could
imagine
otherwise
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
and
then
added
no
one
else
discovered
this
man
presence
in
the
house
that
night
you
have
told
no
one
not
the
doctor
or
the
coroner
or
dr
franklin
oh
no
if
i
had
it
would
have
been
necessary
for
me
to
have
told
what
i
overheard
besides
it
could
have
had
no
direct
bearing
on
daddy
death
that
was
caused
by
as
you
say
but
i
believe
and
i
always
will
believe
that
that
man
killed
father
as
surely
as
inevitably
as
if
he
had
stabbed
or
shot
or
poisoned
him
why
did
he
come
like
a
thief
in
the
night
father
integrity
his
honor
were
known
to
all
the
world
why
did
that
reference
to
this
herbert
and
his
wife
cause
him
such
pain
i
do
know
dear
i
have
no
more
idea
than
you
if
you
really
really
overheard
that
conversation
as
you
seem
convinced
you
did
you
did
well
in
keeping
it
to
yourself
let
that
hour
remain
buried
in
your
thoughts
as
in
your
father
grave
only
rest
assured
that
whatever
it
is
it
casts
no
stain
upon
your
father
good
name
or
his
memory
he
rose
and
gathered
her
into
his
arms
i
must
go
now
anita
i
come
again
you
are
quite
sure
that
you
will
not
accept
my
mother
invitation
i
really
think
it
would
be
better
for
you
she
looked
deeply
into
his
eyes
then
drew
herself
gently
from
his
clasp
not
yet
thank
her
for
me
ramon
with
all
my
heart
but
i
will
not
leave
my
father
house
just
yet
even
for
a
few
days
i
am
sure
that
i
shall
be
happier
here
he
kissed
her
and
left
the
room
she
stood
where
he
had
left
her
until
she
heard
the
heavy
thud
of
the
front
door
then
turning
to
the
window
she
thrust
her
slim
little
hand
between
the
sedately
drawn
curtains
and
waved
him
a
tender
then
with
a
little
sigh
she
dropped
among
the
pillows
of
the
couch
lost
in
thought
whatever
was
meant
by
that
conversation
which
i
overheard
she
murmured
to
herself
ramon
knows
i
read
it
in
his
eyes
the
young
man
as
he
made
his
way
down
the
crowded
avenue
was
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
extraordinary
story
which
the
girl
he
loved
had
told
him
what
could
it
mean
who
could
the
man
have
been
surely
not
herbert
himself
and
yet
oh
why
will
they
not
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
why
must
that
old
scandal
that
one
stain
on
pennington
lawton
past
have
been
brought
again
to
light
and
at
such
a
time
i
pray
god
that
anita
never
mentions
it
to
anyone
else
never
learns
the
truth
by
jove
if
any
complications
arise
from
this
there
will
be
only
one
thing
for
me
to
do
i
must
call
upon
the
master
mind
chapter
ii
revelations
for
two
days
anita
wandered
wraithlike
about
the
great
darkened
house
the
thought
that
ramon
was
keeping
something
from
her
that
he
and
her
dead
father
together
had
kept
a
secret
which
for
some
reason
must
not
be
revealed
to
her
weighed
upon
her
spirits
conjectures
as
to
the
unknown
intruder
on
the
night
of
her
father
death
and
his
possible
purpose
flooded
her
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
in
the
dusk
of
the
winter
afternoon
she
was
lying
on
the
couch
in
her
lost
in
thought
when
ellen
tapping
lightly
at
the
door
interrupted
her
reverie
the
minister
miss
anita
the
rev
franklin
he
is
in
the
oh
anita
gave
a
little
movement
of
dismay
tell
him
that
i
am
suffering
from
a
very
severe
headache
and
gave
orders
that
i
was
not
to
be
disturbed
by
anyone
he
means
well
ellen
of
course
but
he
always
depresses
me
horribly
lately
i
do
feel
like
talking
to
him
this
afternoon
the
maid
retired
but
returned
again
almost
immediately
with
a
surprised
expression
on
her
usually
stolid
face
please
miss
anita
franklin
says
he
must
see
you
and
at
once
he
seems
to
be
excited
and
he
wo
take
no
for
an
answer
ramon
anita
cried
springing
from
the
couch
with
swift
apprehension
something
has
happened
to
ramon
and
franklin
has
come
to
tell
me
he
may
be
injured
dead
ah
god
would
not
do
that
he
would
not
take
him
from
me
too
do
take
on
so
miss
anita
dear
the
faithful
ellen
murmured
as
she
deftly
smoothed
the
girl
hair
and
rearranged
her
gown
the
little
man
acts
more
as
if
he
had
a
fine
piece
of
gossip
to
pass
on
fidgeting
about
like
an
old
woman
he
is
begging
your
pardon
miss
i
know
he
is
the
minister
of
course
and
i
ought
to
show
him
more
respect
but
he
forever
reminds
me
of
a
fat
black
pigeon
the
remarks
of
the
privileged
old
servant
fell
upon
deaf
unheeding
ears
anita
sobbing
softly
beneath
her
breath
flew
down
to
the
where
the
pompous
figure
rose
at
her
entrance
but
was
it
purely
anita
fancy
or
had
some
indefinable
change
actually
taken
place
in
the
manner
of
her
spiritual
adviser
the
rather
eyes
seemed
to
the
girl
to
gleam
somewhat
coldly
upon
her
and
although
he
took
both
her
hands
in
his
in
quick
fatherly
greeting
his
appeared
all
at
once
to
be
lacking
in
warmth
my
poor
child
my
poor
anita
he
began
unctuously
but
she
interrupted
him
what
is
it
franklin
has
something
happened
to
ramon
she
asked
swiftly
please
tell
me
now
without
delay
do
keep
me
in
suspense
i
can
tell
by
your
face
your
manner
that
a
new
misfortune
has
come
to
me
does
it
concern
ramon
oh
no
it
is
not
hamilton
you
need
have
no
fears
for
him
anita
i
have
come
upon
a
business
matter
a
matter
connected
with
your
dear
father
estate
anita
motioned
him
to
a
chair
seating
herself
opposite
she
gazed
at
him
inquiringly
the
settlement
of
the
estate
oh
the
lawyers
are
attending
to
that
i
believe
anita
spoke
a
little
coldly
had
franklin
come
already
to
inquire
about
a
possible
legacy
for
james
she
was
ashamed
of
the
thought
the
next
moment
when
he
said
gently
yes
but
there
is
something
which
i
must
tell
you
it
has
been
requested
that
i
do
so
it
is
a
delicate
matter
to
discuss
with
you
but
surely
no
one
is
more
fitted
to
speak
to
you
than
i
certainly
doctor
i
understand
she
leaned
forward
eagerly
my
dear
you
know
the
whole
country
the
whole
world
at
large
has
always
considered
your
father
to
have
been
a
man
of
great
wealth
yes
my
father
charities
alone
as
you
are
aware
unostentatiously
as
they
were
conducted
would
have
tended
to
give
that
impression
then
his
tremendous
business
interests
anita
at
the
moment
of
your
father
death
he
was
far
from
being
the
king
of
finance
which
the
world
judged
him
to
be
it
is
hard
for
me
to
tell
you
this
but
you
must
know
and
you
must
try
to
believe
that
your
heavenly
father
is
sending
you
this
added
trial
for
some
sure
purpose
of
his
own
your
father
died
a
poor
man
anita
in
fact
a
bankrupt
the
girl
looked
up
with
an
incredulous
smile
franklin
who
could
ever
have
asked
you
to
come
to
me
with
such
an
incredible
assertion
surely
you
must
know
how
preposterous
the
very
idea
is
i
do
not
boast
or
brag
but
it
is
common
knowledge
that
my
father
was
the
richest
man
in
the
city
in
this
entire
part
of
the
country
in
fact
the
thought
of
such
a
thing
is
absurd
who
could
have
attempted
to
perpetrate
such
a
senseless
hoax
a
ridiculous
insult
to
your
intelligence
and
mine
the
minister
shook
his
head
slowly
knowledge
is
alas
not
always
trustworthy
it
is
only
too
true
that
your
father
stood
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
his
entire
fortune
has
been
swept
away
impossible
anita
started
from
her
chair
impressed
in
spite
of
herself
how
could
that
be
who
has
told
you
this
terrible
thing
the
unfortunate
news
was
disclosed
to
me
confidentially
by
your
late
father
truest
friends
and
closest
associates
having
your
best
interests
at
heart
they
feel
that
you
should
know
the
state
of
affairs
at
once
and
came
to
me
as
the
one
best
fitted
to
inform
you
i
can
not
believe
it
anita
lawton
sank
back
with
white
strained
face
i
can
not
believe
that
it
is
true
how
could
such
a
thing
have
happened
they
must
be
mistaken
those
who
gave
you
such
information
father
was
worth
millions
at
least
that
i
know
for
he
told
me
much
of
his
business
affairs
and
up
to
the
last
day
of
his
life
he
was
engaged
in
tremendous
deals
of
almost
national
importance
might
he
not
have
become
so
deeply
involved
in
one
of
them
that
he
could
not
extricate
himself
and
ruin
came
franklin
insinuated
i
know
little
of
finance
of
course
and
those
who
wished
you
to
know
gave
me
none
of
the
details
beyond
the
one
paramount
fact
i
know
of
course
who
were
your
informants
anita
said
no
one
except
my
father
three
closest
associates
had
any
possible
conception
of
how
much
he
possessed
even
approximately
for
he
was
always
secretive
and
conservative
in
his
dealings
only
to
mallowe
rockamore
and
carlis
did
he
ever
divulge
his
plans
to
the
slightest
extent
a
bankrupt
my
father
a
bankrupt
the
very
words
seem
meaningless
to
me
franklin
there
must
be
some
hideous
mistake
unfortunately
it
is
no
mistake
my
poor
child
these
gentlemen
you
mention
i
may
admit
to
you
in
confidence
were
my
informants
you
say
they
gave
you
no
details
beyond
the
paramount
fact
of
my
father
ruin
but
surely
they
must
have
told
you
something
more
i
have
a
right
to
know
franklin
and
i
shall
not
rest
until
i
do
how
did
such
a
catastrophe
come
to
him
there
have
been
no
gigantic
failures
lately
no
panics
which
could
have
swept
him
down
what
terrible
mistake
could
he
have
made
he
whose
judgment
was
almost
infallible
the
minister
hesitated
visibly
and
when
he
spoke
at
last
it
was
as
if
with
a
conscious
effort
he
chose
his
words
i
do
not
think
it
was
any
sudden
collapse
of
some
project
in
which
he
was
engaged
anita
but
a
a
general
series
of
misfortunes
which
culminated
by
forcing
him
just
before
his
death
to
the
brink
of
bankruptcy
you
are
a
mere
child
my
dear
and
could
not
be
supposed
to
understand
matters
of
finance
if
you
will
be
guided
by
me
you
will
accept
the
assurance
of
your
friends
who
truly
have
your
best
interests
at
heart
their
statements
will
be
confirmed
i
know
by
the
lawyers
who
are
engaged
in
settling
up
the
estate
of
your
father
do
not
i
beg
of
you
inquire
too
closely
into
the
details
of
your
father
insolvency
anita
rose
slowly
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
face
of
the
minister
and
with
her
hands
resting
upon
the
as
if
to
steady
herself
she
asked
quietly
why
should
i
not
what
is
there
which
i
his
daughter
should
not
know
franklin
there
is
something
behind
all
this
which
you
are
trying
to
conceal
from
me
i
knew
my
father
to
be
a
you
come
and
tell
me
he
was
a
pauper
instead
a
bankrupt
and
i
am
not
to
ask
how
this
state
of
affairs
came
about
you
have
known
me
since
i
was
a
little
girl
surely
you
understand
me
well
enough
to
realize
that
i
shall
not
rest
under
such
a
condition
until
the
whole
truth
is
revealed
to
me
i
am
your
friend
the
resonance
in
the
minister
voice
deepened
you
will
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
it
would
be
best
for
your
future
for
the
honor
of
your
father
memory
to
place
yourself
without
question
in
the
hands
of
your
true
friends
and
to
ask
no
details
which
are
not
voluntarily
given
you
for
my
future
she
repeated
aghast
the
honor
of
my
father
memory
what
do
you
mean
franklin
you
have
gone
too
far
not
to
speak
plainly
do
you
dare
are
you
insinuating
that
there
was
something
disgraceful
dishonorable
about
my
father
insolvency
you
have
been
my
spiritual
adviser
nearly
all
my
life
and
when
you
tell
me
that
my
father
was
a
bankrupt
that
the
knowledge
comes
to
you
from
his
best
friends
and
will
be
corroborated
by
his
attorneys
i
am
forced
to
believe
you
but
if
you
attempt
to
convince
me
that
my
father
honor
his
good
name
is
involved
then
i
tell
you
that
it
is
not
true
either
a
terrible
mistake
has
been
made
or
a
deliberate
conspiracy
is
on
foot
the
blackest
sort
of
conspiracy
to
defame
the
dead
my
dear
the
minister
raised
his
hands
in
shocked
amazement
you
are
beside
yourself
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
i
have
repeated
to
you
only
that
which
was
told
to
me
and
in
practically
the
same
words
as
to
the
possibility
of
a
conspiracy
you
will
realize
the
absurdity
of
such
an
idea
when
i
deliver
to
you
the
message
with
which
i
was
charged
your
father
partner
in
many
enterprises
the
honorable
bertie
rockamore
together
with
president
mallowe
of
the
street
railways
and
carlis
the
great
politician
promised
some
little
time
ago
that
they
would
stand
in
toward
you
should
your
natural
protector
be
removed
they
desire
me
to
tell
you
that
you
need
have
no
anxiety
for
the
immediate
future
you
will
be
cared
for
and
provided
with
all
that
you
have
been
accustomed
to
just
as
if
your
father
were
alive
indeed
they
are
most
kind
anita
spoke
quietly
enough
but
with
a
curiously
dry
controlled
note
in
her
voice
which
reminded
the
minister
of
her
father
tones
and
for
some
inexplicable
reason
he
felt
vaguely
uncomfortable
please
say
to
them
that
i
do
sincerely
appreciate
their
magnanimity
their
charity
toward
one
who
has
no
right
legal
or
moral
to
claim
protection
or
care
from
them
but
now
franklin
may
i
beg
that
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
retire
the
news
you
have
brought
me
of
course
has
been
a
terrible
shock
i
must
have
time
to
collect
my
thoughts
to
realize
the
sudden
terrible
change
this
revelation
has
made
in
my
whole
life
i
am
deeply
grateful
to
you
to
my
father
three
associates
but
i
can
say
no
more
now
of
course
dear
child
franklin
patted
her
hand
perfunctorily
and
arose
with
relief
that
the
interview
was
at
an
end
he
could
not
understand
her
attitude
of
the
last
few
moments
and
it
troubled
him
vaguely
she
had
received
the
news
of
her
bankruptcy
with
a
girlish
horror
and
incredulousness
which
had
been
only
natural
under
the
circumstances
but
when
it
was
borne
in
upon
her
in
as
delicate
a
way
as
he
could
convey
it
that
dishonor
was
involved
in
the
matter
she
had
after
the
first
outburst
maintained
a
stony
ashen
and
control
that
were
far
from
what
he
had
expected
it
was
the
most
disagreeable
task
he
had
performed
in
many
a
day
and
he
was
heartily
glad
that
it
was
over
only
his
very
great
desire
to
ingratiate
himself
with
these
kings
of
finance
who
had
commissioned
him
to
do
their
bidding
as
well
as
the
inclination
to
be
of
real
service
to
his
young
and
orphaned
parishioner
had
induced
him
to
undertake
the
mission
you
must
rest
and
have
an
opportunity
to
adjust
yourself
to
this
new
unfortunate
state
of
affairs
he
continued
i
will
call
again
if
i
can
be
of
the
slightest
service
to
you
do
not
hesitate
to
let
me
know
it
is
a
sad
trial
but
our
heavenly
father
has
tempered
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lamb
he
has
provided
you
with
a
protector
in
young
hamilton
and
with
kind
true
friends
who
will
see
that
no
harm
or
deprivation
comes
to
you
try
to
feel
that
this
added
grief
and
trouble
will
in
the
end
be
for
the
best
the
alacrity
with
which
he
took
his
departure
was
painfully
obvious
but
anita
scarcely
noticed
it
her
mind
was
busy
with
the
new
hideous
thought
which
had
assailed
her
at
that
first
hint
of
dishonesty
on
the
part
of
her
father
the
thought
that
she
was
being
made
the
victim
of
a
gigantic
conspiracy
as
soon
as
she
found
herself
alone
she
flew
to
the
telephone
main
she
demanded
hamilton
please
is
that
you
ramon
can
you
come
to
me
at
once
i
need
your
advice
and
help
something
has
happened
something
terrible
no
i
can
not
tell
you
over
the
you
will
come
at
once
yes
ramon
dear
she
hung
up
the
receiver
and
paced
the
floor
restlessly
almost
inconceivable
as
it
had
appeared
to
her
consciousness
under
the
first
shock
of
the
announcement
she
might
in
time
have
come
to
accept
the
astounding
fact
of
her
father
insolvency
but
that
disgrace
dishonor
could
have
attached
itself
to
his
name
that
he
the
model
of
uprightness
of
integrity
could
have
been
guilty
of
crooked
dealing
of
something
which
must
for
the
honor
of
his
memory
be
kept
secret
from
the
ears
of
his
she
could
never
bring
herself
to
believe
every
instinct
of
her
nature
revolted
and
underlying
all
her
girlish
unsophistication
a
native
shrewdness
inherited
perhaps
from
her
father
bade
her
distrust
alike
the
worldly
pastor
of
the
church
of
james
and
the
three
friends
who
although
her
father
associates
had
been
his
rivals
and
who
had
offered
with
such
astounding
magnanimity
to
stand
by
her
why
had
they
offered
to
help
her
was
it
really
through
tenderness
and
affection
for
her
father
daughter
or
was
it
to
stay
her
hand
and
close
her
mouth
to
all
queries
why
did
not
ramon
come
surely
he
should
have
been
there
before
this
what
could
be
detaining
him
she
tried
to
be
patient
to
calm
her
seething
brain
while
she
waited
but
it
was
no
use
hours
passed
while
she
paced
the
floor
restlessly
and
the
dusk
settled
into
the
darkness
of
early
winter
wilkes
came
to
turn
on
the
lights
but
she
refused
them
she
could
think
better
in
the
dark
the
came
and
went
and
twice
ellen
knocked
anxiously
upon
the
door
but
anita
torn
with
anxiety
would
pay
no
heed
she
had
telephoned
to
office
only
to
find
that
he
had
left
there
immediately
upon
receiving
her
message
to
his
home
he
had
not
returned
nine
sounded
in
silvery
chimes
from
the
clock
upon
the
mantel
then
ten
and
eleven
and
at
length
just
when
she
felt
that
she
could
endure
no
more
the
front
rang
a
step
sounded
upon
the
stairs
and
ramon
entered
with
a
little
gasp
of
joy
and
relief
she
flung
herself
upon
him
in
the
darkness
but
at
an
involuntary
groan
from
him
she
recoiled
what
is
it
ramon
what
has
happened
to
you
without
waiting
for
a
reply
she
switched
on
the
light
ramon
stood
before
her
his
face
pale
his
eyes
dark
with
pain
one
arm
was
in
a
sling
and
the
thick
hair
upon
his
forehead
barely
concealed
a
long
strip
of
plaster
nothing
really
serious
dear
i
had
a
slight
accident
run
down
by
a
just
after
leaving
the
office
my
head
was
cut
and
i
was
rather
knocked
out
so
they
took
me
to
a
hospital
i
would
have
come
before
but
they
would
not
allow
me
to
leave
i
knew
that
you
would
be
anxious
because
of
my
delay
in
coming
but
i
feared
to
add
to
your
apprehension
by
telephoning
to
you
from
the
hospital
but
your
arm
is
it
sprained
broken
i
had
a
nasty
crash
ca
imagine
how
it
was
that
i
see
the
car
coming
in
time
to
avoid
it
it
was
a
big
limousine
with
several
men
inside
all
singing
and
shouting
riotously
and
the
chauffeur
i
think
must
have
been
drunk
for
he
swerved
the
car
directly
across
the
road
in
my
path
they
never
stopped
after
they
had
bowled
me
over
and
no
one
seemed
to
know
where
they
went
then
the
police
did
not
get
their
number
no
but
they
will
of
course
not
that
i
care
particularly
lucky
to
have
got
off
as
lightly
as
i
did
i
might
have
been
killed
it
was
a
miracle
that
you
were
not
ramon
do
you
know
what
i
believe
i
do
think
it
was
any
accident
but
a
deliberate
attempt
to
assassinate
you
to
keep
you
from
coming
to
me
what
nonsense
dear
they
were
a
wild
hilarious
party
careless
and
irresponsible
such
accidents
happen
every
day
i
am
convinced
that
it
was
no
accident
ramon
i
feel
that
i
am
to
be
the
victim
of
a
conspiracy
that
you
are
the
only
human
being
who
stands
in
the
way
of
my
being
absolutely
in
the
power
of
those
who
would
defraud
me
and
defame
father
name
anita
what
do
you
mean
franklin
called
upon
me
this
afternoon
he
left
just
before
i
telephoned
to
you
he
told
me
an
astonishing
piece
of
news
ramon
would
you
have
considered
my
father
a
rich
man
what
an
absurd
question
dear
of
course
one
of
the
richest
men
in
the
whole
country
as
you
know
you
say
that
he
consulted
you
about
his
business
affairs
and
that
you
knew
of
no
trouble
or
difficulty
which
could
have
caused
him
anxiety
his
securities
in
stocks
and
bonds
his
assets
were
all
sound
certainly
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
my
father
died
a
pauper
that
on
the
word
of
rockamore
mallowe
carlis
and
franklin
he
was
on
the
verge
of
dishonorable
bankruptcy
into
which
i
may
not
inquire
good
heavens
they
must
be
mad
i
am
sure
that
your
father
was
at
the
zenith
of
his
successful
career
and
as
for
dishonor
surely
anita
no
one
who
knew
him
could
credit
that
rockamore
and
the
other
two
who
were
so
closely
associated
with
him
made
a
solemn
promise
to
my
father
shortly
before
his
death
it
seems
that
they
would
care
for
and
provide
for
me
they
sent
franklin
to
me
this
afternoon
to
explain
the
circumstances
to
me
and
to
assure
me
of
their
protection
save
for
you
they
consider
me
absolutely
in
their
hands
and
when
i
sent
for
you
you
were
almost
killed
in
the
attempt
to
come
to
me
ramon
do
you
see
do
you
understand
there
is
some
mystery
on
foot
some
terrible
conspiracy
that
unknown
visitor
my
father
death
so
soon
after
and
now
this
sudden
revelation
of
his
bankruptcy
together
with
this
accident
to
you
ramon
we
must
have
advice
and
help
i
do
not
believe
that
my
father
was
a
pauper
i
know
that
he
has
done
nothing
dishonorable
i
am
convinced
that
the
accident
to
you
was
a
premeditated
attempt
at
murder
my
god
i
ca
believe
it
anita
i
do
know
what
to
think
if
it
turns
out
that
there
really
is
something
crooked
about
it
all
and
rockamore
and
the
others
are
concerned
in
it
it
will
be
the
biggest
conspiracy
that
was
ever
hatched
in
the
world
of
high
finance
you
were
right
dear
bless
your
woman
intuition
we
must
have
help
this
matter
must
be
thoroughly
investigated
there
is
only
one
man
in
america
who
is
capable
of
carrying
it
through
successfully
i
shall
send
at
once
for
the
master
mind

think
father
knew
him
did
he
not
yes
on
one
occasion
he
was
of
inestimable
service
to
your
father
i
will
summon
him
at
once
ramon
went
to
the
telephone
and
by
good
luck
found
the
detective
free
for
the
moment
and
at
his
service
he
returned
to
the
girl
she
noticed
that
he
reeled
slightly
in
his
walk
that
his
lips
were
white
and
set
with
pain
ramon
you
are
ill
suffering
that
cut
on
your
head
and
your
poor
arm
it
is
nothing
i
do
mind
anita
darling
it
will
soon
pass
thank
heavens
i
found
blaine
free
he
will
get
to
the
truth
of
this
matter
for
us
even
if
no
one
else
on
earth
could
he
has
brought
more
notorious
malefactors
to
justice
than
any
detective
of
modern
times
fearlessly
he
has
unearthed
political
scandals
which
lay
dangerously
close
to
the
highest
executives
of
the
land
he
can
not
be
cajoled
bribed
or
intimidated
you
will
be
safe
in
his
hands
from
the
machinations
of
every
scoundrel
who
ever
lived
i
have
read
of
some
of
his
marvelous
exploits
but
what
service
was
it
that
he
rendered
to
my
father
i
i
can
not
tell
you
dearest
it
was
very
long
ago
and
a
matter
which
affected
your
father
solely
perhaps
some
time
you
may
learn
the
truth
of
it
i
may
not
know
i
may
not
know
why
must
i
be
so
hedged
in
why
must
everything
be
kept
from
me
i
feel
as
if
i
were
living
in
a
maze
of
mystery
i
must
know
the
truth
she
wrung
her
hands
hysterically
but
he
soothed
her
and
they
talked
in
low
tones
until
wilkes
suddenly
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
announced
henry
blaine
chapter
iii
henry
blaine
takes
a
hand
a
man
stood
upon
the
threshold
a
man
of
medium
height
with
sandy
hair
and
mustache
slightly
tinged
with
gray
his
face
was
alert
and
keenly
intelligent
his
eyes
shrewd
but
kindly
the
brows
sloping
downward
toward
the
nose
with
the
peculiar
look
of
concentration
of
one
given
to
quick
decisions
and
instant
fearless
action
his
eyes
traveled
quickly
from
the
young
girl
face
to
ramon
hamilton
as
the
latter
advanced
with
outstretched
hand
blaine
it
was
fortunate
that
we
found
you
at
liberty
and
able
to
assist
us
in
a
matter
which
is
of
vital
importance
to
us
both
this
is
miss
anita
lawton
daughter
of
the
late
pennington
lawton
who
desires
your
aid
on
a
most
urgent
matter
miss
lawton
elaine
bowed
over
her
hand
when
they
were
seated
she
said
shyly
i
understand
from
ramon
hamilton
that
you
were
at
one
time
of
great
service
to
my
father
i
trust
that
you
will
be
able
to
help
me
now
for
i
feel
that
i
am
in
the
meshes
of
a
conspiracy
you
know
that
my
father
died
suddenly
almost
a
week
ago
yes
of
course
his
death
was
a
great
loss
to
the
whole
country
miss
lawton
something
occurred
a
few
hours
before
his
death
of
which
even
the
coroner
is
unaware
blaine
i
told
hamilton
what
i
knew
but
he
advised
me
to
say
nothing
of
it
unless
further
developments
ensued
and
they
have
ensued
the
detective
asked
quietly
yes
anita
then
detailed
to
blaine
the
incident
of
her
nocturnal
visitor
as
she
told
him
the
conversation
she
had
overheard
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
eyes
of
the
detective
narrowed
slightly
but
no
other
change
of
expression
betrayed
the
fact
that
the
incident
might
have
held
a
significance
in
his
mind
the
voice
was
entirely
strange
to
you
he
asked
yes
i
have
never
heard
it
before
but
it
made
such
an
impression
upon
me
that
i
think
i
would
recognize
it
instantly
whenever
or
wherever
i
might
happen
to
hear
it
you
caught
no
glimpse
of
the
man
through
the
door
no
i
was
not
far
enough
downstairs
to
see
into
the
room
and
when
you
fled
after
hearing
your
father
groan
you
returned
immediately
to
your
room
yes
i
closed
my
door
and
buried
my
face
deeply
in
the
pillows
on
my
bed
i
did
not
want
to
hear
or
know
any
more
i
was
frightened
i
did
not
know
what
to
think
after
a
time
i
must
have
drifted
off
into
an
uneasy
sort
of
sleep
for
i
knew
nothing
more
until
my
maid
came
to
tell
me
that
wilkes
the
butler
wished
to
speak
to
me
my
father
had
been
found
dead
in
his
chair
no
one
in
the
household
seemed
to
know
of
my
father
late
visitor
for
they
made
no
mention
of
his
coming
i
would
have
told
no
one
except
ramon
but
for
the
fact
that
this
afternoon
my
minister
informed
me
that
my
father
instead
of
being
the
we
had
all
supposed
him
had
in
reality
died
a
bankrupt
the
detective
received
this
information
with
inscrutable
calm
only
by
a
thoughtful
pursing
of
his
lips
did
he
give
indication
that
the
news
had
any
visible
effect
upon
him
anita
continued
giving
him
all
the
details
of
the
minister
visit
and
the
magnanimous
promise
of
her
father
three
associates
to
stand
in
toward
her
it
was
only
when
she
told
of
summoning
her
lover
and
the
accident
which
befell
him
on
his
way
to
her
that
that
peculiar
gleam
returned
again
to
the
eyes
of
blaine
and
they
glanced
narrowly
at
the
young
man
opposite
him
as
i
told
ramon
i
can
not
help
but
feel
that
it
is
not
true
my
father
could
not
have
become
a
pauper
much
less
could
he
the
soul
of
honor
have
been
guilty
of
anything
derogatory
to
his
good
name
until
a
few
days
prior
to
his
death
he
had
been
in
his
usual
excellent
spirits
and
surely
had
there
been
any
financial
difficulties
in
his
path
he
would
have
retrenched
in
some
measure
he
made
no
effort
to
do
so
however
and
in
the
last
few
weeks
has
given
even
more
generously
than
usual
to
the
various
philanthropic
projects
in
which
he
was
so
interested
does
that
look
as
if
he
was
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
he
bought
me
a
string
of
pearls
on
my
birthday
two
months
ago
which
for
their
size
are
considered
by
experts
to
be
the
most
perfectly
matched
in
america
a
fortnight
ago
he
presented
me
with
a
new
car
only
three
days
before
his
death
he
spoke
of
an
ancient
château
in
france
which
he
had
desired
to
purchase
oh
the
whole
affair
is
utterly
inexplicable
to
me
we
will
take
the
matter
up
at
once
miss
lawton
the
main
thing
that
i
must
impress
upon
you
for
the
present
is
to
acquiesce
with
the
utmost
docility
and
unsuspicion
in
every
proposition
made
to
you
by
the
three
men
carlis
mallowe
and
rockamore
in
other
words
place
yourself
absolutely
in
their
hands
but
keep
me
informed
of
every
move
they
make
you
understand
that
the
most
important
factor
in
this
case
is
to
keep
them
absolutely
unsuspecting
of
your
distrust
or
that
you
have
called
me
to
your
assistance
i
must
not
be
seen
coming
here
or
to
hamilton
office
nor
must
you
come
to
mine
i
will
have
a
private
wire
installed
for
you
morning
by
means
of
which
you
can
communicate
with
me
or
one
of
my
operatives
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
in
the
presence
of
anyone
this
telephone
will
connect
only
with
my
office
but
the
number
will
be
supposedly
that
of
your
dressmaker
and
if
you
require
aid
advice
or
the
presence
of
one
of
my
operatives
you
have
merely
to
call
up
the
number
and
say
my
gown
ready
if
it
is
please
send
it
around
immediately
let
me
know
through
this
medium
whatever
occurs
and
take
absolutely
no
one
into
your
confidence
i
understand
blaine
and
i
will
try
to
follow
your
instructions
to
the
letter
oh
by
the
way
there
is
something
i
wish
to
tell
you
which
no
one
not
even
hamilton
knows
much
less
my
friends
or
my
minister
four
years
ago
my
father
financed
a
philanthropic
venture
of
mine
the
anita
lawton
club
for
working
girls
it
is
not
a
purely
charitable
institution
but
a
home
club
where
worthy
young
women
could
live
by
paying
a
nominal
sum
merely
to
preserve
their
and
be
aided
in
obtaining
positions
stenographers
telephone
and
telegraph
operators
clerks
all
find
homes
there
no
one
knew
however
that
under
my
management
the
club
grew
in
less
than
a
year
not
only
to
have
paid
for
itself
but
to
have
yielded
a
small
income
over
and
above
expenses
i
did
not
tell
my
father
i
do
know
why
perhaps
it
was
because
i
inherited
a
little
of
his
business
acumen
but
i
manipulated
the
net
income
in
various
minor
undertakings
even
in
time
buying
small
plots
of
unimproved
meaning
after
a
year
or
two
more
to
surprise
my
father
with
the
result
of
my
venture
but
his
death
intervened
before
i
could
tell
him
about
it
your
father
associates
then
believe
you
to
be
without
funds
or
private
income
of
your
own
the
detective
asked
yes
blaine
and
whatever
money
is
necessary
for
the
investigation
will
of
course
be
forthcoming
from
this
source
let
me
strongly
advise
you
to
make
no
mention
of
it
to
anyone
else
let
these
men
believe
you
to
be
utterly
within
their
power
financially
and
now
miss
lawton
i
will
leave
you
for
i
have
work
to
do
the
detective
rose
the
private
wire
will
be
installed
morning
remember
to
be
absolutely
unsuspicious
to
appear
deeply
grateful
for
the
kindness
offered
you
receive
these
men
and
your
spiritual
adviser
whenever
they
call
and
above
all
keep
me
informed
of
everything
that
occurs
no
matter
how
insignificant
or
irrelevant
it
may
seem
to
you
to
be
keep
me
advised
on
even
the
smallest
details
anything
everything
concerning
you
and
them
thus
it
was
that
when
two
days
later
president
mallowe
of
the
street
railways
called
upon
his
new
ward
she
received
him
with
downcast
eyes
and
a
charmingly
deferential
manner
his
face
with
the
bristling
gray
flushed
darkly
when
she
placed
her
trembling
little
hand
in
his
and
shyly
voiced
her
gratitude
for
his
great
kindness
to
her
my
dear
young
lady
this
has
been
a
most
sad
and
unfortunate
affair
but
i
have
come
to
assure
you
again
of
the
sentiments
of
myself
and
my
associates
toward
you
we
come
your
guardians
we
will
see
that
no
financial
worriments
shall
come
to
you
remember
my
dear
that
i
have
three
married
daughters
of
my
own
and
i
could
not
permit
the
child
of
my
old
friend
to
want
for
anything
you
may
remain
on
here
in
this
house
which
has
been
your
home
indefinitely
and
it
will
be
maintained
for
you
in
the
manner
to
which
you
have
always
been
accustomed
remain
here
in
my
home
anita
stammered
why
it
it
is
my
home
is
it
you
must
consider
it
as
such
i
do
not
like
to
tell
you
this
but
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
know
i
hold
a
mortgage
of
eighty
thousand
dollars
on
the
house
but
i
have
never
recorded
it
because
of
my
friendship
and
close
affiliation
with
your
father
i
shall
not
have
it
recorded
now
of
course
but
there
is
a
slight
condition
purely
a
matter
of
business
which
in
view
of
the
fact
that
through
your
coming
marriage
you
will
have
a
home
of
your
own
rockamore
carlis
and
myself
feel
that
we
should
agree
upon
your
father
has
a
shadowy
interest
in
some
old
bonds
which
have
for
years
been
unremunerative
should
they
prove
of
ultimate
value
we
feel
that
they
should
be
transferred
to
us
as
our
reimbursement
for
the
present
large
sum
which
we
shall
lay
out
for
you
of
course
mallowe
that
would
only
be
just
i
am
glad
that
i
may
perhaps
have
an
opportunity
to
repay
some
of
the
kindness
which
in
your
charity
you
are
now
bestowing
upon
me
i
will
see
that
my
father
attorneys
attend
to
the
matter
as
soon
as
possible
it
may
be
some
little
time
before
the
estate
is
settled
as
of
course
it
must
be
horribly
complicated
and
involved
but
i
will
bring
this
to
their
immediate
attention
you
are
a
very
brave
young
woman
miss
lawton
and
i
am
glad
that
you
are
taking
such
a
view
of
this
double
catastrophe
which
has
come
upon
you
ah
i
had
almost
forgotten
here
is
a
duplicate
of
the
mortgage
which
i
hold
upon
this
house
which
your
father
made
out
to
me
some
months
ago
anita
scarcely
glanced
at
it
but
laid
it
quietly
by
upon
the
table
as
though
it
were
of
small
interest
to
her
mallowe
although
i
understand
that
rockamore
being
a
promoter
was
more
closely
associated
with
my
father
in
various
projects
than
you
i
believe
that
he
always
considered
you
his
best
friend
can
you
tell
me
what
it
was
which
brought
my
father
affairs
to
such
a
pass
as
this
dear
young
lady
do
not
ask
me
it
is
a
painful
subject
to
discuss
and
as
you
are
a
mere
child
you
can
not
be
supposed
to
understand
the
financial
manoeuvres
of
a
man
of
your
father
passion
for
gigantic
operations
years
of
success
had
possibly
made
him
overconfident
and
then
you
know
we
are
none
of
us
infallible
we
are
liable
to
make
mistakes
at
one
time
or
another
your
father
interested
himself
daringly
in
many
schemes
which
we
more
conservative
ones
would
have
hesitated
to
enter
indeed
we
not
only
hesitated
but
repeatedly
declined
when
your
father
placed
the
propositions
before
us
as
you
know
unfortunately
he
was
a
man
who
would
have
resented
any
attempt
at
advice
and
although
for
a
long
time
we
have
seen
his
approaching
financial
downfall
and
have
helped
him
in
every
way
we
could
to
avert
it
he
would
not
relinquish
his
plans
while
there
was
yet
time
do
not
ask
me
to
go
into
any
further
details
it
is
really
most
distressing
your
father
attorneys
will
understand
the
matter
fully
when
the
estate
is
finally
settled
i
can
not
understand
it
anita
murmured
i
thought
my
judgment
almost
infallible
however
mallowe
i
can
not
express
my
gratitude
to
you
and
my
father
other
associates
for
your
great
kindness
toward
me
believe
me
i
am
deeply
affected
by
it
i
shall
never
forget
what
you
have
done
do
not
speak
of
it
dear
miss
lawton
i
only
wish
for
your
sake
that
your
poor
father
had
heeded
poorer
heads
than
his
but
it
is
too
late
to
speak
of
that
now
we
will
do
all
in
our
power
to
aid
you
rest
assured
of
that
should
you
require
anything
you
have
only
to
call
upon
rockamore
carlis
or
myself
when
he
had
bowed
himself
out
anita
flew
to
the
table
seized
the
duplicate
of
the
mortgage
which
he
had
given
her
and
slipped
it
between
the
pages
of
a
book
lying
there
then
she
went
directly
to
her
where
on
a
little
stand
near
her
bed
reposed
a
telephone
instrument
which
had
not
been
there
three
days
previously
grosvenor
she
demanded
and
when
a
voice
replied
to
her
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
she
asked
querulously
is
not
my
new
gown
ready
yet
if
it
is
will
you
kindly
send
it
over
at
once
i
have
also
found
your
last
quarterly
bill
and
i
think
there
is
something
wrong
with
it
i
will
send
it
back
by
the
messenger
who
brings
my
gown
thank
you
she
took
an
envelope
from
the
desk
and
returning
to
the
slipped
the
duplicate
mortgage
within
it
and
sealed
it
carefully
when
a
few
minutes
later
a
tall
dark
young
man
appeared
with
a
large
dressmaker
box
she
placed
the
envelope
in
his
hand
for
blaine
she
whispered
see
that
it
reaches
him
immediately
a
half
hour
afterward
ramon
hamilton
went
to
the
telephone
in
his
office
and
heard
the
detective
voice
over
the
wire
hamilton
have
you
among
the
letters
and
documents
at
your
office
the
signature
of
the
person
we
were
discussing
the
other
day
why
yes
i
think
so
i
will
look
and
see
if
i
have
do
you
wish
me
to
send
it
around
to
you
no
thank
you
a
messenger
boy
will
call
for
it
in
a
few
minutes
wondering
ramon
hamilton
shuffled
hastily
through
the
paper
in
the
of
his
desk
until
he
came
to
a
letter
from
pennington
lawton
he
carefully
tore
off
the
signature
and
when
the
messenger
boy
appeared
gave
it
to
him
he
would
not
have
been
so
puzzled
had
he
seen
the
great
henry
blaine
when
a
few
minutes
had
elapsed
seated
before
the
desk
in
his
office
comparing
the
signature
of
the
torn
slip
which
he
had
sent
with
that
affixed
to
the
duplicate
mortgage
a
long
close
breathless
scrutiny
with
the
most
powerful
magnifying
glasses
and
the
detective
jumped
to
his
feet
that
no
signature
of
pennington
lawton
he
exulted
to
himself
i
thought
i
knew
that
fine
hand
perfectly
as
the
forgery
has
been
done
that
the
work
of
james
brunell
by
the
lord
chapter
iv
the
search
henry
blaine
the
man
of
decision
wasted
no
time
in
vain
thought
instantly
upon
his
discovery
that
the
signature
of
pennington
lawton
had
been
forged
and
that
it
had
been
done
by
an
old
and
offender
he
touched
the
bell
on
his
desk
which
brought
his
confidential
secretary
has
guy
morrow
returned
yet
from
that
blackmail
case
in
denver
yes
sir
he
in
his
private
office
now
making
out
his
report
to
you
a
moment
later
there
entered
a
tall
dark
young
man
strong
and
muscular
in
build
but
not
apparently
heavy
with
a
smooth
face
and
jaw
i
have
finished
my
report
yet
sir
the
report
can
wait
you
remember
james
brunell
the
forger
james
brunell
morrow
repeated
he
was
before
my
time
of
course
but
i
heard
of
him
and
his
exploits
pretty
slick
article
he
i
understand
he
has
been
dead
for
years
at
least
nothing
has
been
heard
of
his
activities
since
i
have
been
in
the
sleuth
game
did
you
ever
hear
of
any
of
his
associates
i
ca
say
that
i
have
sir
except
crimmins
and
dolan
crimmins
died
in
san
quentin
before
his
time
was
up
dolan
after
his
release
went
to
japan
i
want
to
find
brunell
his
closest
associate
was
walter
pennold
i
think
pennold
is
living
somewhere
in
brooklyn
and
through
him
you
may
be
able
to
locate
brunell
morrow
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
retired
crook
in
the
suburbs
that
going
to
take
time
not
the
way
we
work
it
listen
the
next
morning
a
tall
dark
young
man
strong
and
muscular
in
build
with
a
smooth
face
and
jaw
appeared
at
the
bank
of
brooklyn
queens
and
was
immediately
installed
as
a
clerk
after
a
private
interview
with
the
his
fellow
clerks
looked
at
him
askance
at
first
for
they
knew
there
had
been
no
vacancy
and
there
was
a
long
waiting
list
ahead
of
him
but
the
young
man
bore
himself
with
such
a
quiet
modest
air
of
about
him
that
by
the
noon
hour
they
had
quite
accepted
him
as
one
of
themselves
during
the
morning
a
package
came
to
the
bank
and
a
letter
which
read
in
part
i
am
returning
these
securities
to
you
in
the
hope
that
you
may
be
able
to
place
them
in
the
possession
of
jimmy
brunell
they
belong
to
him
and
my
conscience
is
responsible
for
their
return
i
do
know
where
to
find
him
i
do
know
that
at
one
time
he
did
some
banking
at
the
brooklyn
queens
institution
if
he
does
not
do
so
now
kindly
hold
these
securities
for
jimmy
brunell
until
called
for
and
in
the
meantime
see
walter
pennold
of
brooklyn
with
the
package
and
letter
came
a
request
from
henry
blaine
which
those
in
power
at
the
brooklyn
queens
bank
were
only
too
glad
to
accede
to
in
order
to
ingratiate
themselves
with
the
great
investigator
in
accordance
with
this
request
therefore
the
affair
was
made
known
by
the
to
the
clerks
as
a
matter
of
long
standing
which
had
only
just
been
rediscovered
in
an
old
vault
and
the
subordinates
discussed
it
among
themselves
with
the
gusto
of
those
whose
lives
were
bounded
by
gilt
cages
and
circumscribed
by
rules
of
silence
it
was
not
unusual
therefore
that
the
new
clerk
alfred
hicks
should
have
heard
of
it
but
it
was
unusual
that
he
should
find
it
expedient
to
make
a
detour
on
his
way
to
work
the
next
morning
which
would
take
him
to
the
gate
of
walter
pennold
modest
home
perhaps
the
fact
that
alfred
hicks
real
name
was
guy
morrow
and
that
a
letter
received
early
that
morning
from
henry
blaine
office
giving
pennold
address
and
a
single
line
of
instruction
may
have
had
much
to
do
with
his
matutinal
visit
be
that
as
it
may
morrow
the
dapper
young
found
in
the
pennold
household
a
grizzled
man
with
shifty
suspicious
eyes
and
a
moist
behind
him
appeared
a
shrewish
wife
who
eyed
the
intruder
from
the
first
with
animosity
he
smiled
that
frank
winning
smile
which
had
helped
to
land
more
men
behind
the
bars
than
the
astuteness
of
many
of
his
seniors
and
said
i
a
clerk
in
the
brooklyn
queens
bank
pennold
and
we
have
a
box
of
securities
there
evidently
belonging
to
one
jimmy
brunell
no
one
knows
anything
about
it
and
no
note
came
with
it
except
a
line
which
read
for
jim
brunell
see
walter
pennold
of
brooklyn
now
you
the
only
walter
pennold
who
banks
with
the
b
and
i
thought
you
might
like
to
know
about
it
there
are
over
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
securities
and
they
have
evidently
been
left
there
by
somebody
as
you
can
go
to
the
bank
and
see
the
people
about
it
of
course
in
fact
i
understand
they
are
going
to
write
you
a
letter
concerning
it
but
i
thought
you
might
like
to
know
of
it
in
advance
in
case
this
brunell
is
alive
they
will
pay
him
the
money
on
demand
or
if
dead
to
his
heirs
after
him
the
man
with
the
shifty
eyes
spat
cautiously
and
then
rubbing
his
stubby
chin
with
a
hairy
freckled
hand
observed
well
young
man
i
pennold
all
right
i
do
some
business
with
the
brooklyn
queens
people
small
business
of
course
for
we
poor
honest
folk
have
the
money
to
put
in
finance
that
the
big
have
i
do
know
where
you
can
find
this
man
brunell
have
heard
of
him
in
years
but
i
understand
he
went
wrong
that
so
mame
the
woman
nodded
her
head
in
slow
and
thought
pennold
edged
a
little
nearer
his
unknown
guest
and
asked
in
a
tone
of
heartiness
and
what
might
your
name
be
you
a
feller
to
be
a
not
the
stolid
plodding
kind
morrow
chuckled
again
my
name
is
hicks
i
live
at
jefferson
place
it
only
a
little
way
from
here
you
know
he
swung
his
nonchalantly
of
course
do
get
you
anywhere
but
it
steady
such
as
it
is
and
i
go
out
with
the
boys
a
lot
he
added
confidentially
the
ponies
are
still
running
you
know
even
if
the
is
closed
and
there
are
other
ways
he
paused
significantly
i
see
a
sport
eh
pennold
darted
a
quick
glance
at
his
wife
well
do
let
it
get
the
best
of
you
young
feller
remember
what
i
told
you
about
jimmy
brunell
at
least
what
the
report
of
him
was
if
i
hear
anything
of
where
he
is
i
let
the
bank
know
i
be
getting
on
i
late
now
morrow
paused
on
the
bottom
step
of
the
little
porch
and
turned
see
you
again
pennold
and
your
wife
if
you
let
me
i
pass
by
here
often
i
been
boarding
with
lindsay
on
jefferson
place
for
some
time
now
by
the
way
have
you
seen
the
sporting
page
of
the
this
morning
al
goetz
edits
it
you
know
and
he
gives
you
the
straight
dope
there
be
nothing
to
that
fight
they
pulling
off
saturday
night
at
the
zucker
athletic
club
hennessey
put
it
all
over
schnabel
in
the
first
round
if
you
hear
anything
of
this
brunell
be
sure
you
let
me
or
the
bank
know
for
a
long
moment
after
his
buoyant
stride
had
carried
him
out
of
sight
around
the
corner
walter
pennold
and
his
wife
sat
in
thoughtful
silence
then
the
woman
spoke
what
d
think
of
it
all
wally
dunno
the
gentleman
addressed
drew
from
his
pocket
a
blackened
odoriferous
pipe
and
sucked
upon
it
must
be
some
lay
of
course
i
go
up
to
the
bank
and
find
out
what
i
can
but
i
do
think
that
young
feller
hicks
is
in
on
it
i
been
in
the
game
for
forty
years
and
if
i
a
judge
he
no
fool
kid
spendin
he
earns
and
out
for
what
coin
he
can
grab
i
look
up
that
landlady
of
his
too
mame
and
if
he
on
the
level
there
and
at
the
bank
and
if
those
securities
are
at
the
bank
he
ought
to
be
willin
to
come
in
with
us
on
a
share
the
wife
supplemented
shrewdly
but
it
seems
like
some
kind
of
a
gag
to
me
you
knew
all
jimmy
brunell
jobs
till
he
got
religion
or
somethin
and
turned
honest
i
ca
think
of
any
old
crook
who
turn
over
that
money
to
him
two
hundred
thousand
cold
because
his
conscience
hurt
him
can
you
you
know
too
how
decent
and
respectable
jimmy
been
livin
all
these
years
putting
up
a
front
for
the
sake
of
that
daughter
of
his
suppose
this
was
a
game
to
catch
him
what
do
the
bulls
want
him
for
i
ai
no
i
look
up
this
business
of
securities
and
then
if
the
young
feller
talked
straight
we
try
to
work
it
through
him
if
we
can
get
to
him
and
i
guess
we
can
so
long
as
i
ai
lost
the
gift
of
the
gab
in
twenty
years
we
be
as
good
sorrowing
heirs
as
ever
jimmy
brunell
could
find
anywheres
before
walter
pennold
could
reach
the
bank
however
an
unimpeachably
official
letter
arrived
from
that
institution
confirming
the
news
imparted
by
the
concerning
the
securities
left
for
james
brunell
pennold
going
to
the
bank
ostensibly
to
assure
those
in
authority
there
of
his
cordial
willingness
to
assist
in
the
search
for
the
heir
incidentally
assured
himself
of
alfred
hicks
seemingly
legitimate
occupation
a
later
visit
to
lindsay
of
jefferson
place
convinced
him
that
the
young
man
had
lived
there
for
some
months
and
was
as
generous
a
boarder
as
that
excellent
woman
had
ever
taken
into
her
house
just
what
price
was
paid
by
henry
blaine
to
lindsay
for
that
statement
is
immaterial
to
this
narrative
but
it
suffices
that
walter
pennold
returned
to
the
wife
of
his
bosom
with
only
one
obstacle
in
his
thoughts
between
himself
and
a
goodly
share
of
the
coveted
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
that
obstacle
was
an
extremely
healthy
fear
of
jimmy
brunell
it
was
true
that
there
had
been
no
connection
between
them
in
years
but
he
remembered
jimmy
attitude
toward
the
snitcher
as
well
as
toward
the
man
who
held
out
on
his
pals
and
behind
his
cupidity
was
a
lurking
caution
which
was
made
manifest
when
he
walked
into
the
kitchen
and
found
pennold
with
her
shriveled
arms
immersed
in
the
washtub
say
mame
the
young
feller
hicks
is
all
right
and
so
is
the
bank
but
how
about
jimmy
himself
if
i
can
fix
the
young
feller
and
we
can
pull
it
off
with
the
bank
that
all
well
and
good
but
jimmy
should
hear
of
it
know
what
would
happen
to
us
do
you
if
he
ai
heard
of
them
securities
all
this
time
they
been
forgotten
in
the
bank
it
safe
he
wo
hear
of
now
unless
you
tell
him
retorted
his
shrewder
half
dryly
of
course
if
lived
straight
as
he
has
for
near
twenty
years
as
far
as
we
know
and
he
finds
it
out
he
grab
everything
for
himself
why
should
he
but
the
bulls
are
after
him
for
somethin
and
the
as
well
as
us
where
are
we
if
we
mix
up
in
this
tell
me
that
there
another
side
of
it
too
mame
pennold
walked
to
the
window
and
regarded
the
sordid
lines
of
washed
clothes
contemplatively
what
if
jimmy
has
been
up
to
somethin
on
the
quiet
that
the
bulls
ai
on
to
and
this
bunch
of
securities
is
on
the
level
if
i
went
to
him
on
the
square
and
offered
him
a
percentage
to
play
dead
would
he
be
ready
and
willin
to
divide
of
course
he
would
he
no
fool
returned
pennold
shortly
but
let
me
tell
you
wally
i
do
like
the
look
of
that
walter
pennold
of
brooklyn
on
the
note
in
the
bank
they
was
trying
to
trace
him
through
us
you
talkin
like
a
blame
fool
mame
them
securities
has
been
there
for
years
forgotten
everybody
knows
that
me
and
brunell
was
pals
in
the
old
days
but
no
one
got
nothin
on
us
now
and
he
give
up
the
game
years
ago
how
know
he
did
persisted
his
wife
doggedly
that
what
you
better
find
out
but
you
gotter
be
careful
about
it
in
case
this
whole
thing
should
be
a
plant
you
do
have
to
tell
me
pennold
grumbled
i
write
him
first
and
then
wait
a
few
days
and
if
anyone
tailing
me
in
the
meantime
they
have
a
run
for
their
money
write
him
of
course
you
may
have
forgotten
the
old
cipher
but
i
have
you
know
yourself
we
invented
it
jimmy
and
me
and
the
police
tried
their
level
best
to
get
on
to
it
but
failed
you
ca
address
it
in
cipher
and
if
you
tailed
you
wo
get
a
chance
to
mail
it
wally
better
wait
and
try
to
see
him
without
writing
for
answer
pennold
opened
a
drawer
in
the
table
drew
forth
a
grimy
sheet
of
paper
and
an
envelope
and
bent
laboriously
to
his
task
it
was
long
past
dusk
when
he
had
finished
and
tossed
the
paper
across
the
table
for
his
wife
perusal
this
is
what
she
saw
illustration
an
image
of
a
coded
message
is
shown
here
in
the
text
when
she
had
gazed
long
at
the
characters
she
shook
her
head
at
him
and
a
slow
smile
came
over
her
face
you
forgotten
a
little
yourself
wally
you
made
a
mistake
in
the
he
glanced
at
it
and
then
laid
his
huge
rough
hand
on
her
thin
hair
in
the
first
caress
he
had
given
her
in
years
by
god

the
next
morning
alfred
hicks
was
a
little
late
in
getting
to
his
work
at
the
bank
so
late
in
fact
that
he
had
only
time
to
wave
a
cordial
greeting
to
his
new
friends
in
their
cages
as
he
passed
he
paused
however
that
evening
with
a
pot
of
flowering
bloom
for
pennold
dingy
not
and
a
packet
of
tobacco
which
he
shared
generously
with
his
host
he
talked
much
with
the
garrulous
of
youth
but
did
not
mention
the
matter
of
the
securities
and
left
the
crafty
couple
completely
disarmed
neither
on
entering
nor
leaving
did
hicks
appear
to
notice
a
short
swarthy
figure
loitering
in
the
shadow
of
a
ailanthus
tree
near
the
corner
it
would
have
appeared
curious
therefore
that
the
lurking
figure
followed
the
almost
to
his
lodgings
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
just
before
jefferson
place
was
reached
the
figure
sidled
up
to
hicks
side
and
whispered
no
news
yet
morrow
pennold
went
this
morning
to
old
loui
the
grabber
and
tried
to
borrow
money
from
him
but
did
get
it
i
heard
the
whole
talk
then
he
went
to
tanbark
pete
and
got
a
after
that
he
divided
his
time
between
two
saloons
where
he
played
dominoes
and
pinochle
and
his
own
house
i
got
to
report
to
when
i
sure
the
subject
is
safe
for
the
night
have
you
found
anything
yet
only
that
i
got
him
on
the
run
if
he
knows
where
our
man
is
suraci
he
go
after
him
in
a
day
or
two
meantime
tell
in
case
i
do
get
a
chance
to
let
him
know
that
the
securities
stunt
went
all
right
and
my
end
of
it
is
the
next
day
and
the
following
pennold
did
indeed
set
for
the
young
italian
detective
a
swift
pace
he
departed
upon
long
rambles
which
started
briskly
and
ended
aimlessly
he
called
upon
harmless
and
tedious
acquaintances
from
jamaica
to
fordham
he
went
apparently
and
ostentatiously
to
look
for
a
position
as
janitor
to
many
in
lower
manhattan
which
he
invariably
entered
and
left
by
different
doors
in
the
evenings
he
sat
blandly
upon
his
own
stoop
smoking
and
chatting
amiably
if
monosyllabically
with
his
wife
and
their
friend
alfred
hicks
while
his
indefatigable
shadow
glowered
apparently
unnoticed
from
the
gloom
of
the
ailanthus
tree
on
thursday
morning
however
pennold
betook
himself
leisurely
to
the
nearest
subway
station
and
there
the
real
trial
of
strength
between
him
and
his
unseen
antagonist
began
from
the
brooklyn
bridge
station
he
rode
to
the
grand
central
then
with
a
speed
which
belied
his
physical
appearance
he
raced
across
the
bridge
to
the
downtown
platform
and
caught
a
train
for
fourteenth
street
there
he
swiftly
turned
north
to
street
then
to
the
grand
central
again
to
and
so
on
doubling
from
station
to
station
until
finally
he
felt
that
he
must
be
entirely
secure
from
pursuit
he
alighted
at
length
at
a
station
far
up
in
the
bronx
and
after
looking
carefully
about
he
started
off
toward
the
west
where
the
mushroom
growth
of
the
new
city
sprang
up
in
rows
of
rococo
brick
and
stone
houses
with
oases
of
green
fields
and
open
lots
between
he
turned
up
a
little
lane
of
tiny
frame
houses
each
set
in
its
trim
garden
and
stopped
at
the
fourth
cottage
with
a
last
furtive
backward
glance
pennold
mounted
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
nervously
the
door
was
opened
from
within
so
suddenly
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
man
who
faced
his
visitor
on
the
threshold
must
have
been
awaiting
the
summons
he
stepped
quickly
out
shutting
the
door
behind
him
and
for
a
short
space
the
two
stood
talking
in
low
tones
pennold
eagerly
insistently
the
other
man
evasively
slowly
as
if
choosing
his
words
with
care
he
was
as
erect
as
pennold
was
shambling
and
and
although
gray
and
lined
of
features
his
eyes
were
clear
and
more
steady
his
chin
more
firm
his
whole
bearing
more
elastic
and
forceful
he
did
not
invite
his
visitor
to
enter
and
the
colloquy
between
them
was
brief
it
was
significant
that
they
did
not
shake
hands
but
parted
with
a
brief
though
not
unfriendly
nod
the
tall
man
turned
and
his
house
closing
the
door
again
behind
him
while
pennold
scuttled
away
without
a
farewell
glance
it
might
have
been
well
had
he
looked
once
more
over
his
shoulder
for
there
crouching
against
the
veranda
rail
where
he
had
managed
to
overhear
the
last
of
the
conversation
was
that
short
swarthy
figure
which
had
followed
so
indefatigably
on
his
trail
for
three
days
which
had
clung
to
him
closely
but
unseen
through
all
his
devious
journey
of
that
morning
suraci
had
not
failed
he
tailed
pennold
to
his
home
then
went
in
person
with
his
report
to
the
great
blaine
himself
who
heard
him
through
in
silence
and
then
brought
his
mighty
fist
down
upon
his
desk
with
a
blow
which
made
the
massive
bronze
quiver
that
our
man
you
got
him
suraci
good
work
now
wait
a
little
i
want
you
to
take
some
instructions
yourself
over
to
morrow
the
next
day
the
pennolds
missed
the
cheery
greeting
of
their
new
friend
the
since
the
acquaintanceship
had
been
so
recently
formed
it
was
odd
that
they
should
have
been
as
deeply
concerned
over
his
defection
as
they
were
they
said
little
that
evening
but
when
his
absence
continued
the
second
day
pennold
himself
ambled
down
to
the
brooklyn
queens
bank
and
reluctantly
deposited
twenty
dollars
merely
for
the
pleasure
of
a
chat
with
young
hicks
the
latter
cheery
face
failed
to
greet
him
however
within
its
portals
and
a
craftily
worded
inquiry
merely
elicited
the
information
that
he
was
no
longer
connected
with
that
institution
what
do
you
make
of
it
mame
he
asked
anxiously
of
his
wife
when
he
reached
home
his
step
was
more
shambling
than
ever
and
his
hands
clutching
his
trembled
more
than
her
gnarled
palsied
ones
i
tell
you
what
i
think
when
i
been
around
to
this
afternoon
to
jefferson
place
what
you
goin
to
do
there
you
ca
ask
for
him
very
well
objected
her
spouse
do
she
retorted
tartly
what
would
i
do
in
a
look
for
rooms
for
us
of
course
and
inquire
about
the
other
lodgers
to
be
sure
it
respectable
for
a
decent
married
couple
do
you
think
i
goin
lookin
for
a
son
the
life
must
be
gettin
you
at
last
wally
your
head
ai
what
it
used
to
be
but
pennold
vaunted
astuteness
gained
her
little
knowledge
which
could
be
of
value
to
her
in
their
late
acquaintance
lindsay
was
a
enormously
stout
old
lady
with
a
stern
eye
and
commanding
presence
who
looked
as
if
in
her
younger
days
she
might
well
have
been
a
as
indeed
she
had
been
she
had
two
double
rooms
and
a
single
hall
bedroom
to
show
for
inspection
and
she
waxed
surprisingly
voluble
concerning
the
vacancy
of
the
latter
at
the
first
tentative
mention
of
her
other
lodgers
by
her
visitor
as
nice
a
young
man
as
ever
you
wish
to
see
i
do
have
none
but
the
most
refined
people
in
my
house
lived
with
me
a
year
and
a
half
hicks
did
except
for
his
vacation
regular
as
clockwork
in
his
bills
and
free
and
with
his
tips
to
delia
of
course
he
was
just
what
you
might
call
steady
in
his
and
but
there
never
was
nothin
objectionable
in
his
habits
you
know
what
young
men
is
he
had
a
fine
position
in
a
bank
here
in
brooklyn
but
i
do
think
the
company
he
kep
was
all
that
it
might
have
been
kind
of
flashy
and
sporty
his
friends
was
and
i
guess
that
what
got
him
into
trouble
for
trouble
he
was
in
when
he
paid
me
yesterday
in
full
even
to
the
shavin
mug
which
bought
for
his
dresser
and
meant
him
to
keep
for
a
present
and
picked
up
bag
and
baggage
and
left
i
always
did
think
friday
was
an
unlucky
day
he
stood
in
the
vestibule
and
shook
both
my
hands
and
there
was
a
dry
eye
in
his
head
or
mine
lindsay
he
says
to
me
just
like
i
tellin
it
to
you
lindsay
i
ca
stay
here
no
longer
i
wisht
to
heavings
i
could
for
you
given
me
a
real
home
he
says
i
not
at
the
bank
no
more
and
i
going
away
i
in
trouble
he
says
need
tell
you
where
i
goin
for
i
ai
got
a
friend
who
ask
after
me
or
care
but
i
just
want
to
thank
you
for
all
your
kindness
to
me
an
to
ask
you
to
accept
this
present
and
give
this
to
delia
when
she
comes
in
from
the
this
is
what
he
give
me
as
a
present
lindsay
pointed
dramatically
to
a
german
silver
brooch
set
with
a
doubtful
garnet
at
her
throat
and
i
was
so
broke
up
over
it
all
that
i
forgot
and
give
delia
the
whole
dollar
instead
of
just
a
quarter
like
i
done
i
i
ought
to
write
to
his
folks
but
i
do
know
where
they
are
he
comes
from
somewheres
and
i
never
was
one
to
pry
in
a
boarder
letters
or
i
just
worried
sick
about
it
all
lindsay
would
have
made
a
superb
actress
when
the
interview
was
at
an
end
and
pennold
had
rejoined
her
husband
they
discussed
the
disappearance
of
alfred
hicks
from
every
standpoint
and
came
finally
to
the
conclusion
that
the
young
sporting
proclivities
had
brought
him
to
ruin
meanwhile
in
a
modest
cottage
in
meadow
lane
in
the
bronx
a
small
card
reading
room
to
let
had
been
removed
from
the
bay
window
and
just
behind
its
curtains
a
young
man
sat
his
eyes
fastened
upon
the
house
across
the
way
the
fourth
from
the
end
of
the
line
he
was
a
tall
dark
young
man
with
a
smooth
face
and
jaw
and
his
new
knew
him
as
guy
morrow
all
at
once
as
he
sat
watching
the
door
of
the
cottage
opened
and
a
girl
came
out
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
her
she
was
quite
a
common
type
of
girl
slender
not
too
tall
with
a
wealth
of
hair
and
soft
hazel
eyes
yet
there
was
something
about
her
which
made
guy
morrow
catch
his
breath
and
throwing
caution
to
the
winds
he
parted
the
curtains
and
leaned
forward
looking
down
upon
her
as
she
reached
the
gate
his
gaze
drew
hers
and
she
lifted
her
gentle
eyes
and
looked
into
his
then
her
lids
drooped
swiftly
a
faint
flush
tinged
her
delicate
face
and
with
lowered
head
she
walked
quickly
on
guy
morrow
sank
back
in
his
chair
and
after
the
warm
glow
which
had
surged
up
so
suddenly
within
him
a
chill
crept
about
his
heart
what
could
that
slender
girl
be
to
the
man
he
had
been
sent
to
spy
upon
to
jimmy
brunell
the
forger
chapter
v
the
will
henry
blaine
sat
in
his
office
leisurely
turning
over
the
pages
of
a
morning
newspaper
his
attitude
was
one
of
apparent
idleness
but
the
occasional
swift
glances
he
darted
at
the
clock
and
a
slight
lifting
of
his
eyebrows
at
the
least
sound
from
without
betokened
the
fact
that
he
was
waiting
for
some
one
or
something
his
eyes
scanned
the
columns
of
each
page
with
seeming
carelessness
yet
their
keen
glances
missed
not
one
significant
phrase
and
suddenly
his
gaze
was
transfixed
by
a
paragraph
tucked
away
in
a
corner
of
the
second
page
it
was
merely
an
account
of
trouble
between
capital
and
labor
in
a
distant
manufacturing
city
and
a
hint
of
an
organized
strike
which
threatened
for
the
immediate
future
the
great
detective
was
not
at
all
a
politician
and
the
social
and
economic
conditions
of
the
day
held
no
greater
import
for
him
than
for
any
other
conscientious
citizen
of
the
country
yet
he
sat
for
a
long
moment
with
wrinkled
brow
and
pursed
lips
musing
while
the
newspaper
dropped
unheeded
upon
the
desk
his
reverie
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
sharp
insistent
tinkling
of
the
telephone
a
clear
girlish
voice
came
to
him
over
the
wire
is
this
grosvenor
this
is
miss
lawton
speaking
an
alteration
must
be
made
at
once
in
that
last
gown
you
sent
me
and
it
is
imperative
that
i
see
you
in
person
concerning
it
it
will
be
inconvenient
for
me
to
have
you
come
here
this
morning
where
shall
i
see
you
at
your
establishment
or
she
paused
suggestively
and
he
replied
with
a
hurried
question
it
is
absolutely
necessary
miss
lawton
that
you
see
me
in
person
you
are
quite
sure
absolutely
her
voice
held
a
ring
of
earnestness
and
something
more
which
caused
him
to
jump
to
a
decision
very
well
i
will
meet
you
in
twenty
minutes
at
your
working
club
i
am
an
architect
remember
and
you
wish
to
build
a
new
and
more
improved
institution
of
the
same
order
on
another
site
therefore
you
have
met
me
there
to
show
me
over
the
old
building
and
suggest
changes
in
its
plans
for
the
new
one
you
understand
miss
lawton
my
name
is
banks
remember
and
be
a
few
minutes
late
i
understand
perfectly
thank
you
the
receiver
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
clicked
abruptly
and
the
detective
sprang
to
his
feet
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
blaine
presented
himself
at
the
anita
lawton
club
where
a
trim
maid
ushered
him
into
a
tiny
office
there
behind
the
desk
sat
a
girl
and
at
sight
of
her
the
detective
master
of
himself
as
he
was
gave
an
imperceptible
start
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
her
she
was
quite
a
common
type
of
girl
slender
not
too
tall
with
a
wealth
of
hair
and
soft
hazel
eyes
yet
she
reminded
blaine
vaguely
but
insistently
of
some
one
else
some
one
whom
he
had
encountered
in
the
past
he
recovered
himself
at
once
and
presented
the
card
which
announced
him
as
the
senior
member
of
the
firm
of
banks
and
frost
architects
whom
did
you
wish
to
see
sir
the
girl
turned
slowly
about
in
her
swivel
chair
and
regarded
him
respectfully
but
coolly
her
voice
was
low
and
gentle
and
distinctly
feminine
yet
it
brought
to
him
again
that
haunting
sense
of
resemblance
which
the
first
vision
of
her
had
caused
miss
lawton
he
replied
quietly
but
miss
lawton
is
not
here
the
girl
surprise
was
unfeigned
i
have
an
appointment
to
meet
her
here
at
this
time
she
may
perhaps
have
been
detained
she
has
arranged
to
go
over
the
club
building
with
me
as
you
see
by
my
card
i
am
an
architect
and
she
is
planning
more
extensive
work
i
believe
along
the
lines
instituted
here
at
least
that
is
the
impression
she
has
given
my
firm
i
will
wait
a
short
time
if
i
may
you
are
connected
with
the
official
work
of
the
club
i
am
the
secretary
the
girl
paused
and
then
added
i
understand
perfectly
sir
will
you
be
seated
please
miss
lawton
had
not
told
me
of
her
appointment
here
with
you
she
will
without
doubt
arrive
shortly
henry
blaine
seated
himself
and
as
she
started
to
turn
back
to
her
desk
he
asked
quickly
you
must
find
the
work
here
very
interesting
do
you
not
we
our
firm
have
erected
several
philanthropic
institutions
of
learning
and
recreation
but
none
precisely
on
this
order
miss
lawton
has
shown
us
the
plans
of
this
present
club
and
we
consider
the
arrangement
of
the
dormitories
particularly
ingenious
with
regard
to
economy
of
space
and
the
requisite
sunlight
and
air
oh
yes
the
girl
turned
toward
him
swiftly
her
face
suffused
with
interest
miss
lawton
drew
all
the
plans
herself
and
they
were
not
changed
in
the
least
i
do
see
how
they
could
possibly
be
improved
upon
miss
lawton
has
done
splendid
work
here
sir
the
club
has
been
a
wonderful
success
since
it
was
first
opened
it
must
have
been
the
detective
paused
then
added
easily
i
know
that
her
late
father
was
very
proud
of
her
executive
ability
you
er
you
educate
young
women
here
do
you
not
and
train
them
for
positions
we
not
only
train
the
members
of
the
club
but
obtain
positions
for
them
with
reputable
business
firms
the
girl
answered
indeed
blaine
asked
with
apparent
surprise
what
sort
of
positions
do
the
members
of
your
club
fill
whatever
they
are
capable
of
acquiring
a
working
knowledge
of
filing
clerks
stenographers
secretaries
switchboard
operators
telegraphers
even
governesses
we
have
never
had
a
failure
and
i
think
it
is
because
miss
lawton
gives
not
only
her
personal
attention
but
real
love
and
faith
to
each
girl
she
is
wonderful
the
face
of
the
young
woman
was
rapt
as
she
spoke
and
blaine
could
guess
without
further
explanation
that
she
herself
was
a
protégée
of
miss
lawton
and
a
grateful
one
unless
she
were
playing
a
part
if
so
she
was
an
actress
of
transcendent
ability
you
say
that
you
have
never
had
a
failure
that
must
indeed
be
encouraging
blaine
remarked
tentatively
perhaps
we
might
arrange
later
with
you
or
miss
lawton
to
place
one
or
two
of
your
clerks
or
stenographers
we
are
enlarging
our
offices
good
morning
a
fresh
young
voice
interrupted
him
and
anita
lawton
stood
upon
the
threshold
did
banks
come
yet
ah
yes
i
see
how
do
you
do
blaine
arose
and
anita
gave
him
her
hand
cordially
his
quick
eyes
observed
that
in
passing
she
patted
the
shoulder
of
her
secretary
affectionately
and
the
girl
looked
up
at
her
quickly
with
eyes
aglow
the
truth
was
no
longer
concealed
from
his
discernment
the
girl
was
staunch
in
every
fiber
of
her
being
miss
lawton
i
am
sorry
but
i
have
really
not
any
too
much
time
this
morning
if
we
could
proceed
to
business
at
once
certainly
if
you
will
come
this
way
banks
at
the
door
she
paused
and
turned
to
the
secretary
i
will
see
you
later
dear
anita
led
the
detective
swiftly
through
the
wide
clean
halls
and
up
the
stairs
explaining
in
clear
distinct
tones
the
on
the
second
floor
she
opened
the
door
leading
into
a
little
at
the
front
of
the
house
just
over
the
office
and
when
they
were
seated
she
said
quickly
with
rising
excitement
although
her
voice
was
carefully
hushed
bl
banks
i
have
something
to
show
you
my
father
will
it
was
discovered
or
rather
produced
yesterday
the
lawyers
who
have
charge
of
the
estate
anderson
wallace
you
know
seem
to
me
to
be
perfectly
disinterested
and
honest
but
i
am
so
hedged
in
on
every
hand
by
a
stifling
feeling
of
deceit
and
treachery
that
i
feel
i
can
trust
no
one
save
you
and
hamilton
not
even
poor
old
ellen
my
maid
who
has
been
with
me
since
i
was
born
i
quite
understand
miss
lawton
and
i
realize
how
difficult
the
situation
is
for
you
but
i
want
you
to
trust
no
one
at
least
to
the
extent
of
giving
them
your
confidence
now
about
the
will
it
was
produced
by
your
late
father
attorneys
no
by
president
mallowe
of
the
street
railways
it
appears
that
father
left
it
in
his
charge
anderson
drew
it
his
partner
wallace
witnessed
it
and
they
both
assure
me
that
it
is
absolutely
authentic
here
it
is
she
opened
her
bag
and
handed
a
long
envelope
to
him
but
at
first
his
attention
was
held
by
what
she
had
said
and
he
frowned
as
he
repeated
quickly
i
trust
you
did
not
show
any
suspicion
that
you
doubted
for
a
moment
that
it
was
genuine
oh
by
no
means
it
was
anderson
himself
who
took
especial
pains
to
assure
me
of
its
authenticity
blaine
regarded
the
envelope
reflectively
for
a
moment
before
he
raised
the
flap
why
had
the
attorney
considered
it
necessary
to
assure
his
late
client
daughter
that
the
will
which
he
had
himself
drawn
was
genuine
the
will
was
short
and
to
the
point
in
it
pennington
lawton
left
everything
of
which
he
died
possessed
to
his
daughter
unconditionally
and
without
reservation
of
course
miss
lawton
since
you
are
only
twenty
and
your
father
has
named
no
guardian
or
trustee
the
courts
will
at
once
appoint
one
and
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
i
believe
the
guardian
so
appointed
will
be
one
of
your
father
three
associates
presumably
mallowe
however
that
will
make
little
difference
in
our
investigation
and
since
it
is
claimed
that
all
your
father
huge
fortune
is
lost
the
matter
of
a
guardian
can
not
tie
our
hands
in
any
way
now
just
a
moment
please
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
small
but
powerful
magnifying
glass
and
the
slip
of
paper
which
ramon
hamilton
had
sent
him
on
which
was
the
signature
of
the
late
pennington
lawton
through
the
microscope
he
carefully
compared
it
with
that
affixed
to
the
will
and
then
looked
up
reassuringly
it
is
quite
all
right
miss
lawton
in
my
estimation
the
will
is
authentic
and
your
father
signature
genuine
he
folded
the
paper
slipped
it
in
its
envelope
and
returned
it
to
her
there
is
one
thing
now
which
i
must
most
earnestly
caution
you
against
do
not
sign
any
paper
no
matter
who
wishes
it
or
orders
it
no
matter
if
it
is
the
most
trivial
household
receipt
do
not
write
any
letters
yourself
or
notes
to
any
one
even
to
hamilton
you
understand
they
might
be
intercepted
if
anyone
wishes
you
to
sign
a
paper
relating
to
the
matter
of
your
father
estate
say
you
can
not
do
so
until
you
have
shown
it
in
private
to
hamilton
that
you
have
promised
you
will
not
do
so
any
other
papers
you
can
easily
evade
signing
as
for
your
private
correspondence
obtain
a
social
secretary
and
permit
her
to
sign
everything
one
whom
you
can
trust
say
one
of
your
girls
from
here
that
girl
downstairs
for
instance
what
is
her
name
anita
lawton
rose
and
a
peculiar
pained
expression
passed
over
her
features
i
am
sorry
blaine
really
really
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
tell
you
her
name
that
was
one
of
the
conditions
under
which
she
came
to
us
here
that
is
why
i
have
given
her
an
official
position
here
in
the
club
she
is
staunch
and
faithful
and
true
i
know
it
i
feel
it
and
she
is
too
to
pass
under
any
name
not
her
own
i
know
and
am
heartily
in
sympathy
with
the
reason
for
her
secretiveness
you
know
that
i
trust
you
implicitly
but
i
know
you
would
not
have
me
go
back
on
my
word
when
once
it
has
been
given
certainly
not
miss
lawton
i
realize
that
many
of
your
protégées
here
may
come
of
unfortunate
antecedents
if
you
feel
that
you
can
trust
her
use
her
do
you
feel
equally
sure
of
the
other
members
of
your
club
absolutely
i
feel
that
they
all
really
love
me
that
they
would
do
anything
for
me
they
could
in
the
world
and
yet
i
have
done
so
little
for
them
only
given
them
the
little
help
which
i
was
able
to
bestow
which
we
should
all
do
for
those
less
fortunate
than
ourselves
why
did
you
ask
me
blaine
if
i
felt
that
i
could
trust
the
girls
who
have
placed
themselves
under
my
care
because
we
may
have
need
of
them
in
the
future
they
may
be
of
the
most
vital
assistance
to
us
in
this
investigation
should
events
turn
out
as
i
anticipate
and
they
prove
worthy
of
the
charge
it
may
be
necessary
for
me
to
impose
on
them
but
enough
of
that
for
now
if
at
any
time
you
wish
to
see
me
personally
telephone
me
as
you
did
this
morning
and
i
will
meet
you
here
the
detective
left
her
in
the
office
of
the
secretary
and
as
he
made
his
adieus
to
them
both
he
cast
a
last
quick
penetrating
glance
at
the
girl
behind
the
desk
again
that
vague
sense
of
resemblance
possessed
him
with
whom
was
she
connected
why
was
her
name
so
significantly
withheld
in
the
meantime
guy
morrow
from
his
post
of
observation
in
the
window
of
the
little
cottage
on
meadow
lane
had
watched
the
object
of
his
espionage
for
several
fruitless
days
fruitless
because
the
actions
of
the
man
brunell
had
been
so
obviously
those
of
one
who
felt
himself
utterly
beyond
suspicion
the
erect
man
had
come
and
gone
about
his
business
without
the
slightest
attempt
at
concealment
a
few
of
the
simplest
inquiries
of
his
had
elicited
the
fact
that
the
gentleman
opposite
old
brunell
was
a
and
worked
at
his
trade
in
a
little
shop
in
the
nearest
row
of
brick
buildings
just
around
the
corner
that
he
had
lived
in
the
little
cottage
since
it
had
first
been
erected
six
years
before
alone
with
his
daughter
emily
and
before
that
they
had
for
many
years
occupied
a
small
apartment
near
by
in
fact
the
girl
had
grown
up
in
that
neighborhood
he
was
a
quiet
man
not
very
talkative
but
well
liked
by
his
neighbors
and
his
daughter
was
devoted
to
him
according
to
quinlan
guy
morrow
aforesaid
emily
brunell
was
a
dear
sweet
girl
very
popular
among
the
young
people
in
the
neighborhood
but
she
kept
strictly
at
home
in
her
leisure
hours
and
preferred
her
father
companionship
to
that
of
anyone
else
she
was
employed
in
some
business
capacity
downtown
from
nine
until
six
just
what
it
was
quinlan
did
not
know
morrow
kept
well
in
the
background
in
case
pennold
should
put
in
an
appearance
again
but
he
did
not
evidently
that
conversation
overheard
by
suraci
had
been
a
final
one
concerning
the
securities
at
least
and
no
one
else
called
at
the
little
cottage
door
over
the
way
except
a
young
man
to
whom
morrow
took
an
instant
and
inexplicable
dislike
morrow
made
it
a
point
to
visit
and
investigate
the
little
shop
at
an
hour
when
he
knew
brunell
would
not
be
there
and
found
in
the
cursory
examination
possible
at
that
time
that
its
purpose
seemed
to
be
strictly
legitimate
a
boy
of
fifteen
or
thereabout
was
in
charge
and
the
operative
easily
succeeded
in
engaging
his
stolid
attention
elsewhere
while
with
a
bit
of
soft
wax
carefully
palmed
in
his
left
hand
he
succeeded
in
gaining
an
impression
of
the
lock
on
the
flimsy
door
from
this
he
had
a
key
made
in
anticipation
of
orders
from
his
chief
requiring
a
thorough
search
of
the
little
shop
orders
which
for
the
first
time
in
his
career
he
shrank
from
he
made
no
effort
to
scrape
an
acquaintance
with
brunell
himself
but
frequently
encountered
as
if
by
accident
the
daughter
emily
on
her
way
to
and
from
the
subway
station
if
she
recognized
in
him
the
young
lodger
across
the
street
she
made
no
sign
and
as
the
days
passed
morrow
the
man
despaired
of
gaining
her
friendship
save
through
her
father
whom
morrow
the
operative
had
received
orders
not
to
approach
personally
before
he
had
seen
her
had
he
known
that
the
old
forger
possessed
a
daughter
he
would
have
laid
his
plans
to
worm
himself
into
the
confidence
of
the
little
family
through
the
girl
but
having
once
laid
eyes
upon
her
face
in
all
its
gentle
trusting
purity
every
manly
instinct
in
him
revolted
at
the
thought
of
making
her
a
tool
of
her
father
probable
downfall
there
was
a
third
member
of
the
brunell
household
whom
morrow
had
observed
frequently
seated
upon
the
doorstep
or
on
one
of
the
lower
window
sills
a
small
scraggly
black
kitten
with
stiff
outstanding
fur
and
an
absurdly
belligerent
attitude
whenever
a
dog
chanced
to
pass
through
the
lane
it
waited
in
the
doorway
each
night
for
the
return
of
its
mistress
and
in
the
soft
glow
of
the
lamplight
which
streamed
from
within
he
had
seen
her
catch
the
little
creature
up
affectionately
and
cuddle
it
up
against
her
neck
before
the
door
closed
upon
them
one
afternoon
in
the
early
november
twilight
as
morrow
was
returning
to
his
own
door
after
shadowing
brunell
on
an
aimless
and
chilly
walk
he
saw
the
kitten
lying
curled
up
just
outside
its
own
gate
and
an
inspiration
sprang
to
his
ingenious
mind
he
seated
himself
upon
the
steps
of
quinlan
front
porch
and
waited
until
the
darkness
had
deepened
sufficiently
to
cloak
his
nefarious
scheme
then
with
soft
beguiling
tone
and
a
few
remarks
for
he
hated
cats
morrow
began
a
deliberate
attempt
to
entice
the
kitten
across
to
him
come
here
kitty
kitty
he
called
softly
come
pussy
dear
come
here
you
mangy
little
beast
come
cattykins
at
his
first
words
the
kitten
raised
its
head
and
regarded
him
with
yellow
eyes
gleaming
through
the
dusk
in
unconcealed
antagonism
but
at
the
soft
purring
flattery
of
his
voice
the
gleam
softened
to
a
glow
of
pleased
interest
and
the
little
creature
rose
lazily
stretched
itself
and
tripped
lightly
over
to
him
its
tail
erect
in
optimistic
confidence
morrow
picked
it
up
gingerly
by
the
neck
and
tucked
it
beneath
his
coat
stroking
its
head
with
a
reluctant
thumb
while
it
purred
loudly
in
sleepy
content
at
the
warmth
of
its
welcome
the
hour
was
approaching
when
emily
brunell
usually
made
her
appearance
and
he
trusted
to
luck
to
keep
the
little
animal
quiet
until
she
had
entered
her
home
and
discovered
its
loss
but
the
fickle
goddess
failed
him
the
kitten
grew
suddenly
uneasy
as
if
some
intuition
warned
it
of
treachery
and
tried
valiantly
to
escape
from
his
grasp
and
never
did
spartan
boy
with
wolf
concealed
beneath
his
tunic
suffer
more
tortures
than
morrow
with
the
wretched
little
creature
clawing
at
his
hands
would
emily
brunell
never
come
what
could
be
keeping
her
of
all
nights
morrow
gripped
the
soft
elusive
bundle
of
fur
with
desperate
firmness
and
looked
across
the
street
evidently
he
was
not
the
only
one
impatient
for
her
arrival
the
doorway
opposite
had
opened
and
jimmy
brunell
stood
peering
anxiously
forth
into
the
darkness
at
that
moment
the
kitten
emitted
a
fearsome
yowl
which
morrow
smothered
hastily
with
his
coat
he
fancied
that
the
old
man
turned
his
head
quickly
and
glanced
in
his
direction
and
never
had
the
operative
felt
guiltier
brunell
however
retired
within
closing
the
door
after
him
and
the
kitten
struggles
gradually
grew
weaker
and
finally
ceased
morrow
felt
a
horrible
fear
surging
up
within
him
that
he
had
strangled
the
little
beast
and
his
grasp
gradually
relaxed
then
he
opened
his
overcoat
cautiously
and
peered
within
the
kitten
was
sleeping
peacefully
and
he
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
glancing
up
just
in
time
to
see
emily
brunell
pass
quickly
through
her
own
gate
and
up
to
the
door
he
sat
motionless
on
the
steps
of
quinlan
and
his
patience
was
rewarded
when
after
a
few
moments
the
brunell
door
and
he
heard
the
girl
voice
calling
anxiously
kitty
kitty
morrow
rose
with
unfeigned
alacrity
and
crossing
the
road
opened
the
little
gate
without
ceremony
and
mounted
the
steps
of
the
porch
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
blandly
is
this
your
kitten
it
er
wandered
across
the
street
to
me
and
fell
asleep
under
my
coat
i
board
just
over
the
way
you
know
with
quinlan
my
name
is
morrow
the
girl
gave
a
little
cry
of
relieved
anxiety
and
caught
the
kitten
in
her
arms
oh
i
am
so
glad
i
was
afraid
it
was
lost
and
it
is
so
tiny
and
defenseless
to
be
out
all
alone
in
the
cold
and
darkness
thank
you
so
much
morrow
i
suppose
it
was
waiting
for
me
as
it
usually
does
and
grew
restless
at
my
delay
poor
little
thing
it
was
kind
of
you
to
comfort
it
feeling
like
an
utter
brute
morrow
stammered
a
humble
disclaimer
of
her
undeserved
gratitude
and
moved
toward
the
steps
oh
but
it
was
really
kind
of
you
most
men
hate
cats
although
my
father
loves
them
i
should
have
been
home
much
earlier
but
i
was
detained
by
some
extra
work
at
the
club
where
i
am
employed
the
club
he
repeated
stupidly
yes
replied
the
girl
quietly
cuddling
the
kitten
beneath
her
chin
the
anita
lawton
club
for
working
girls
she
caught
herself
up
sharply
even
as
she
spoke
and
a
look
almost
of
apprehension
crossed
her
ingenuous
face
for
a
moment
and
was
gone
thank
you
again

walked
down
the
steps
and
across
to
his
own
lodgings
with
his
brain
awhirl
the
investigation
through
the
medium
of
a
small
black
kitten
had
indeed
taken
an
amazing
turn

chapter
vi
the
first
the
little
paragraph
in
the
newspaper
which
irrelevant
as
it
would
seem
had
caught
the
keenly
discerning
eye
of
henry
blaine
grew
in
length
and
importance
from
day
to
day
until
it
reached
a
position
on
the
first
page
and
then
spread
in
huge
headlines
over
the
entire
sheet
instead
of
relating
merely
the
incidents
of
a
labor
strike
in
a
manufacturing
city
and
that
city
a
one
it
became
speedily
a
sociological
question
of
almost
national
import
the
yellow
journals
were
quick
to
seize
upon
it
at
the
psychological
moment
of
civic
unrest
and
throw
out
hints
vague
but
vast
in
their
significance
of
the
mighty
interests
behind
the
mere
fact
of
the
strike
the
great
financial
question
involved
the
crisis
between
capital
and
labor
the
trusts
and
the
common
people
the
workers
and
the
wasters

the
land
of
the
free
henry
blaine
seated
in
his
office
read
the
and
smiled
his
slow
inscrutable
illuminating
smile
the
smile
which
without
menace
or
rancor
had
struck
terror
to
the
hearts
of
the
greatest
malefactors
of
his
generation
which
without
flattery
or
ingratiation
had
won
for
him
the
friendship
of
the
greatest
men
in
the
country
he
knew
every
move
in
the
gigantic
game
which
was
being
played
solely
for
his
attention
long
before
a
pawn
was
lifted
from
its
place
a
single
counter
changed
he
had
known
it
from
the
moment
that
the
seemingly
unimportant
paragraph
had
met
his
eyes
and
he
also
knew
the
men
who
sat
in
the
game
whose
hands
passed
over
the
great
chessboard
of
current
events
whose
brains
directed
the
moves
and
the
stakes
not
the
welfare
of
the
workingmen
in
that
distant
city
not
the
lifting
of
the
grinding
heel
of
temporal
power
from
the
supine
bodies
of
the
humble
but
the
peace
of
mind
the
honorable
untarnished
name
the
earthly
riches
of
the
slender
girl
who
sat
in
that
great
darkened
house
on
belleair
avenue
hence
blaine
sat
back
quietly
and
waited
for
the
decisive
move
which
he
knew
to
be
forthcoming
waited
and
not
in
vain
the
spectacular
play
to
the
gallery
of
one
was
dramatically
accomplished
it
was
heralded
by
extras
bawled
through
the
midnight
streets
and
display
headlines
in
the
papers
the
next
morning
promptly
on
the
stroke
of
nine
henry
blaine
arrived
at
his
office
and
as
he
expected
found
awaiting
him
an
urgent
telegram
from
the
chief
of
police
of
the
city
where
the
strike
had
assumed
such
colossal
importance
earnestly
asking
him
for
his
immediate
presence
and
assistance
he
sent
a
tentative
refusal
and
waited
still
more
insistent
messages
followed
in
rapid
succession
from
the
mayor
of
that
city
the
governor
of
that
state
even
its
representative
in
the
senate
at
washington
to
all
of
which
he
replied
in
the
same
emphatic
negative
strain
then
late
in
the
afternoon
there
eventuated
that
which
he
had
anticipated
mohammed
came
to
the
mountain
blaine
read
the
card
which
his
confidential
secretary
presented
and
laid
it
down
upon
the
desk
before
him
show
him
in
he
directed
shortly
he
did
not
rise
from
his
chair
nor
indeed
change
his
position
an
iota
but
merely
glanced
up
from
beneath
slightly
raised
eyebrows
when
the
door
opened
again
and
a
bulky
pompous
figure
stood
almost
obsequiously
before
him
come
in
carlis
he
invited
coolly
take
this
chair
what
can
i
do
for
you
it
was
significant
that
neither
man
made
any
move
toward
shaking
hands
although
it
was
obvious
that
they
were
acquainted
at
least
the
great
detective
tone
when
he
greeted
his
visitor
was
as
distinctly
ironical
as
the
latter
was
uneasy
although
he
replied
with
a
mirthless
chuckle
which
was
intended
to
be
airily
nonchalant
nothing
for
me
blaine
that
is
not
one
can
never
tell
in
this
period
of
sudden
changes
and
revolt
when
our
city
may
be
stricken
as
another
was
just
a
few
hours
ago
there
is
no
better
cleaner
more
honestly
prosperous
metropolis
in
these
united
states
than
illington
but
carlis
the
political
boss
who
had
ruled
for
more
than
a
decade
in
almost
undisputed
sway
paused
and
gulped
as
if
his
oratorical
eloquence
stuck
suddenly
in
his
throat
the
detective
watched
him
passively
a
disconcerting
look
of
inquiring
interest
on
his
mobile
face
it
is
because
of
our
stricken
sister
city
that
i
am
here
went
on
the
visitor
i
know
i
will
not
be
in
great
favor
with
you
as
an
advocate
blaine
we
have
had
our
little
tilts
in
the
past
when
you
er
disapproved
of
my
methods
of
conducting
my
civic
office
and
i
distrusted
your
motives
but
that
is
forgotten
now
and
i
come
to
you
merely
as
one
citizen
to
another
the
mayor
of
grafton
has
wired
me
as
has
the
chief
of
police
to
urge
you
to
proceed
there
at
once
and
take
charge
of
the
investigation
into
last
night
bomb
outrages
in
connection
with
the
great
strike
they
inform
me
that
you
have
repeatedly
refused
to
come
to
their
assistance
blaine
nodded
that
is
quite
true
carlis
i
did
decline
the
offers
extended
to
me
but
surely
you
can
not
refuse
good
heavens
man
do
you
realize
what
it
means
if
you
do
it
is
only
that
there
is
a
fortune
in
it
for
you
your
reputation
stands
or
falls
on
your
decision
this
is
a
public
charge
the
people
rely
upon
you
if
you
wo
for
some
reason
of
your
own
come
to
the
rescue
now
when
you
are
publicly
called
upon
you
be
a
ruined
man
the
voice
of
the
boss
ascended
in
a
shrill
falsetto
of
remonstrance
there
may
be
two
opinions
as
to
that
carlis
blaine
returned
quietly
as
far
as
the
financial
argument
goes
i
think
you
discovered
long
ago
that
its
appeal
to
me
is
based
upon
a
different
point
of
view
than
your
own
you
forget
that
i
am
not
a
servant
of
the
public
but
a
private
citizen
free
to
accept
or
decline
such
offers
as
are
made
to
me
in
my
line
of
business
as
i
choose
this
affair
is
not
a
public
charge
but
a
business
proposition
which
i
decline
as
to
my
reputation
depending
upon
it
i
differ
with
you
my
reputation
will
stand
i
think
upon
my
record
in
the
past
even
if
every
yellow
newspaper
in
the
city
is
paid
to
revile
me
carlis
rested
his
plump
hands
upon
his
widespread
knees
and
leaned
as
far
forward
in
his
eager
anxiety
as
his
obese
figure
would
permit
but
why
he
fairly
wailed
his
carefully
rounded
oratorical
tones
forgotten
why
on
earth
do
you
decline
this
offer
blaine
nothing
big
on
hand
now
nothing
your
operatives
ca
attend
to
there
is
a
case
big
enough
for
your
attention
on
the
calendar
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
illington
is
clean
and
that
the
lid
is
on
for
keeps
the
police
are
taking
care
of
the
petty
crimes
and
there
absolutely
nothing
doing
in
your
line
here
at
the
moment
this
is
the
chance
of
your
career
why
on
earth
do
you
refuse
it
well
carlis
let
us
say
for
instance
that
my
health
is
not
quite
as
good
as
it
was
and
i
find
the
air
of
illington
agrees
with
it
better
just
now
than
that
of
grafton
blaine
leaned
back
easily
in
his
chair
and
after
a
slight
pause
he
added
speculatively
with
deliberate
intent
i
did
know
you
had
interests
there
the
boss
purpled
look
here
blaine
he
bellowed
what
mean
by
that
merely
following
a
train
of
thought
carlis
returned
the
detective
imperturbably
i
was
trying
to
figure
out
why
you
were
so
desperately
anxious
to
have
me
go
to
grafton
i
tell
you
i
am
here
at
the
urgent
request
of
the
mayor
and
the
chief
of
police
the
fat
man
protested
but
faintly
as
if
the
unexpected
attack
had
temporarily
winded
him
why
in
h
ll
should
i
want
you
to
go
to
grafton
presumably
because
grafton
is
some
fourteen
hundred
miles
from
illington
remarked
blaine
his
quietly
unemotional
tones
hardening
suddenly
like
tempered
steel
going
to
try
to
pull
off
something
here
in
town
which
you
think
could
be
more
easily
done
if
i
were
away
cards
on
the
table
carlis
you
tried
to
bribe
me
in
a
case
once
and
you
failed
then
you
tried
bullying
me
and
you
found
that
work
either
now
you
come
again
with
your
hook
baited
with
patriotism
public
spirit
the
cry
of
the
people
and
all
the
rest
of
the
guff
the
newspapers
you
control
have
been
handing
out
to
their
readers
since
you
took
them
over
what
the
idea
the
boss
rose
with
what
was
intended
for
an
air
of
injured
dignity
but
his
fat
face
all
at
once
seemed
sagged
and
wrinkled
like
a
pricked
balloon
i
did
not
come
here
to
be
insulted
he
announced
in
his
most
impressive
manner
i
came
as
i
told
you
as
a
citizen
because
the
officials
of
another
city
called
upon
me
to
urge
you
to
aid
them
i
have
failed
in
my
mission
and
i
will
go
i
am
surprised
blaine
at
your
attitude
i
thought
you
were
too
big
a
man
to
permit
your
personal
antagonism
to
me
to
interfere
with
your
duty
for
the
first
time
during
their
interview
blaine
smiled
slightly
have
you
ever
known
me
carlis
to
permit
my
personal
antagonism
to
you
or
any
other
man
to
interfere
with
what
i
conceive
to
be
my
duty
before
he
replied
the
politician
produced
a
voluminous
silk
handkerchief
and
mopped
his
brow
for
some
reason
he
did
not
feel
called
upon
to
make
a
direct
answer
well
what
reason
am
i
to
give
to
the
mayor
of
grafton
and
its
political
leaders
for
your
refusal
that
talk
about
me
trying
to
get
you
out
of
illington
blaine
is
all
bosh
and
you
know
it
running
illington
just
as
i
run
it
for
the
last
ten
years
in
spite
of
your
interference
or
any
other
man
and
i
going
to
stay
right
on
the
job
if
you
wo
give
any
other
reason
for
declining
the
call
to
grafton
than
your
preference
for
the
air
of
illington
then
the
bets
go
as
they
lay
he
jammed
his
hat
upon
his
head
and
strode
from
the
room
with
all
the
ferocity
his
rotund
figure
could
express
the
first
decisive
move
in
the
game
had
failed
the
door
was
scarcely
closed
behind
him
when
blaine
turned
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
anita
lawton
on
the
private
wire
can
you
arrange
to
meet
me
at
once
at
your
working
girls
club
he
asked
i
wish
to
suggest
a
plan
to
be
put
into
immediate
operation
very
well
i
can
be
there
in
fifteen
minutes
when
the
detective
arrived
at
the
club
he
was
ushered
immediately
to
the
small
on
the
second
floor
where
he
found
anita
anxiously
awaiting
him
miss
lawton
he
began
without
further
greeting
than
a
quick
handclasp
you
told
me
the
other
day
that
your
girls
here
were
all
staunch
and
faithful
to
you
your
secretary
downstairs
had
previously
informed
me
that
they
were
trained
to
hold
positions
of
trust
and
that
you
obtained
such
positions
for
them
i
want
you
to
obtain
four
positions
for
four
of
the
girls
in
whom
you
place
the
most
implicit
confidence
why
certainly
blaine
if
i
can
do
you
mean
that
they
are
to
have
something
to
do
with
your
investigation
into
my
affairs
i
want
them
to
play
detective
for
me
miss
lawton
have
you
four
girls
unemployed
at
the
moment
say
for
instance
a
filing
clerk
a
stenographer
a
governess
and
a
switchboard
operator
who
are
sufficiently
intelligent
and
proficient
in
their
various
occupations
to
assume
such
a
trust
why
yes
i
i
think
we
have
i
can
find
out
of
course
where
do
you
wish
to
place
them
that
is
the
most
difficult
part
of
all
miss
lawton
you
must
obtain
the
positions
for
them
these
three
men
who
stand
in
toward
you
as
you
say
and
your
spiritual
adviser
franklin
who
so
obviously
wishes
to
ingratiate
himself
with
them
would
none
of
them
refuse
a
request
of
this
sort
from
you
at
this
stage
of
the
game
particularly
if
they
are
really
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
against
you
go
to
these
four
men
mallowe
first
and
tell
them
that
because
of
the
sudden
complete
loss
of
your
fortune
your
club
must
be
disorganized
and
beg
them
each
to
give
one
of
your
girls
special
protégées
of
yours
a
position
send
your
filing
clerk
to
mallowe
your
most
expert
stenographer
to
rockamore
your
switchboard
operator
to
carlis
and
your
governess
into
the
household
of
your
minister
i
have
learned
that
he
has
three
small
children
and
his
wife
applied
only
yesterday
at
an
agency
for
a
nursery
governess
the
last
proposition
may
be
the
most
difficult
for
you
to
handle
but
i
think
if
you
manage
to
convey
to
the
reverend
franklin
the
fact
that
your
three
guardians
have
each
taken
one
of
your
girls
into
their
employ
in
order
to
help
them
and
that
his
following
their
benevolent
example
would
bring
him
into
closer
with
them
no
objection
will
be
made
provided
of
course
the
young
woman
is
suitable
i
will
try
blaine
but
of
course
i
can
do
nothing
about
that
until
as
it
is
so
late
in
the
afternoon
however
i
can
have
a
talk
with
the
girls
if
they
are
in
now
or
would
you
prefer
to
interview
them
no
you
talk
with
them
first
miss
lawton
and
morning
while
you
are
arranging
for
their
positions
i
will
interview
them
and
instruct
them
in
their
primary
duties
i
will
leave
you
now
remember
that
the
girls
must
be
absolutely
trustworthy
and
the
stenographer
who
will
be
placed
in
the
office
of
rockamore
must
be
particularly
expert
after
the
detective
had
taken
his
departure
anita
lawton
descended
quickly
to
the
office
of
the
secretary
emily
she
asked
is
loretta
murfree
in
or
fifine
déchaussée
i
think
they
both
are
miss
lawton
shall
i
ring
for
them
yes
please
emily
send
them
to
me
one
at
a
time
in
the
and
let
me
know
when
agnes
olson
and
margaret
hefferman
come
in
i
wish
to
talk
with
all
four
of
them
but
separately
loretta
murfree
was
the
first
to
put
in
an
appearance
she
was
a
short
dumpy
girl
of
twenty
and
she
bounced
into
the
room
with
a
flashing
smile
how
are
you
dear
miss
lawton
we
have
missed
you
around
here
so
much
lately
but
of
course
we
knew
that
you
must
be
very
much
occupied
she
stopped
and
a
little
embarrassed
flush
spread
over
her
face
i
have
been
loretta
thank
you
so
much
for
your
kind
note
and
for
your
share
in
the
beautiful
wreath
you
girls
sent
in
memory
of
my
dear
father
sure
we
all
of
us
your
friends
miss
lawton
why
would
we
be
after
all
you
done
for
us
it
is
because
i
feel
that
that
i
wanted
to
have
a
talk
with
you
this
afternoon
loretta
if
a
position
were
offered
to
you
as
filing
clerk
in
the
office
of
a
great
financier
of
this
city
at
a
suitable
salary
would
you
accept
it
if
you
could
be
doing
me
a
great
personal
service
at
the
same
time
would
i
miss
lawton
just
try
me
i
take
it
for
the
experience
alone
without
the
salary
and
jump
at
the
chance
even
if
you
were
concerned
in
it
at
all
but
if
it
would
be
doing
you
a
service
at
the
same
time
i
more
than
glad
thank
you
loretta
the
position
will
be
with
an
associate
of
my
father
i
think
president
mallowe
of
the
street
railways
you
must
attend
faithfully
to
your
duties
if
i
am
able
to
obtain
this
place
for
you
but
i
think
the
main
part
of
your
service
to
me
will
consist
of
keeping
your
eyes
open
morning
a
man
will
come
here
and
interview
you
a
man
in
whom
you
must
place
implicit
confidence
and
trust
and
whose
directions
you
must
follow
to
the
letter
he
will
tell
you
just
what
to
do
for
me
this
man
is
my
friend
he
is
working
in
my
interests
and
if
you
care
for
me
you
must
not
fail
him
indeed
i
wo
miss
lawton
i
do
whatever
he
tells
me
you
said
that
i
was
to
keep
my
eyes
open
does
that
mean
that
there
is
something
you
wish
me
to
find
out
for
you
she
asked
shrewdly
i
can
not
tell
you
exactly
what
you
are
to
do
for
me
loretta
the
gentleman
whom
you
are
to
meet
morning
will
give
you
all
the
details
anita
lawton
approached
the
girl
and
laid
her
hand
on
her
shoulder
i
can
surely
trust
you
you
will
not
fail
me
the
quick
tears
sprang
to
the
irish
girl
eyes
and
for
a
moment
softened
their
rather
hard
brilliance
you
know
that
you
can
trust
me
miss
lawton
i
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
anita
lawton
held
a
similar
conversation
with
each
of
the
three
girls
with
a
like
result
to
fifine
déchaussée
a
tall
refined
girl
with
the
colorless
devout
face
of
a
religieuse
the
probability
of
entering
a
minister
home
as
governess
for
his
children
was
most
welcome
the
young
french
girl
homesick
and
alone
in
a
strange
land
had
found
in
anita
lawton
her
one
friend
and
her
gratitude
for
this
first
opportunity
given
her
seemed
overwhelming
margaret
hefferman
rejoiced
at
the
possible
opportunity
of
becoming
a
stenographer
to
the
great
promoter
rockamore
and
demure
little
agnes
olson
was
equally
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
operating
a
switchboard
in
the
office
of
timothy
carlis
the
politician
meantime
back
in
his
office
henry
blaine
was
receiving
the
personal
report
of
guy
morrow
the
old
man
seems
to
be
strictly
on
the
level
he
was
saying
he
attends
to
his
own
affairs
and
seems
to
be
running
a
legitimate
business
in
his
little
shop
where
he
prints
and
sells
maps
i
went
there
of
course
to
look
it
over
but
i
could
see
anything
crooked
about
it
however
when
i
left
i
took
a
wax
impression
of
the
lock
in
case
you
wanted
me
to
have
a
key
made
and
institute
a
more
thorough
investigation
at
a
time
when
i
would
not
be
disturbed
that
good
morrow
we
may
need
to
do
that
later
at
present
i
want
you
merely
to
keep
an
eye
on
them
and
note
who
their
visitors
are
you
been
talking
with
the
girl
you
say
the
daughter
yes
sir
the
young
man
paused
in
sudden
confusion
she
a
very
quiet
respectable
proud
sort
of
young
woman
blaine
not
at
all
the
kind
you
would
expect
to
find
the
daughter
of
an
old
crook
like
jimmy
brunell
and
by
the
way
here
a
funny
coincidence
she
a
protégée
of
miss
lawton
employed
in
some
philanthropic
home
or
club
as
she
calls
it
which
pennington
lawton
daughter
runs
by
jove
blaine
exclaimed
i
might
have
known
it
i
thought
there
was
something
familiar
about
her
appearance
when
i
first
saw
her
no
wonder
miss
lawton
had
promised
not
to
divulge
her
name
it
a
small
world
morrow
i
have
to
look
into
this
go
back
now
and
keep
your
eye
on
jimmy
very
well
sir
guy
morrow
paused
at
the
door
and
turned
toward
his
chief
have
you
seen
the
late
editions
of
the
evening
papers
blaine
they
all
slamming
you
for
refusing
to
accept
the
call
to
grafton
to
investigate
those
bomb
outrages
last
night
henry
blaine
smiled
there
wo
be
any
more
of
them
he
remarked
quietly
that
strike
will
die
down
as
quickly
as
it
arose
morrow
the
whole
thing
was
a
plant
and
the
labor
leaders
and
factory
owners
themselves
were
merely
tools
in
the
hands
of
the
politicians
that
strike
was
arranged
by
our
friend
timothy
carlis
to
get
me
away
from
illington
on
a
false
mission
you
do
think
sir
that
they
suspect
no
but
they
are
taking
no
chances
on
my
getting
into
the
game
they
do
suspect
yet
but
they
will
soon
because
the
time
has
come
for
us
to
get
busy
chapter
vii
the
letter
the
next
morning
when
ramon
hamilton
presented
himself
at
henry
blaine
office
in
answer
to
the
latter
summons
he
found
the
great
detective
in
a
mood
more
nearly
bordering
upon
excitability
than
he
could
remember
having
witnessed
before
instead
of
being
seated
calmly
at
his
desk
his
thoughts
masked
with
his
usual
inscrutable
imperturbability
blaine
was
pacing
restlessly
back
and
forth
with
the
disquietude
not
of
agitation
but
of
concentrated
ebullient
energy
i
sent
for
you
hamilton
he
began
after
greeting
his
visitor
cordially
and
waving
him
to
a
chair
because
we
must
proceed
actively
with
the
investigation
into
the
alleged
bankruptcy
of
pennington
lawton
we
have
been
passive
long
enough
for
me
to
have
gathered
some
significant
facts
but
we
now
must
make
a
salient
move
the
time
has
yet
come
for
me
to
step
out
into
the
open
when
i
do
it
will
be
a
fight
and
i
must
be
equipped
with
facts
not
theories
i
want
some
particulars
about
lawton
insolvency
and
there
is
no
one
who
could
more
naturally
inquire
into
this
without
arousing
suspicion
than
you
i
do
need
to
tell
you
blaine
how
anxious
i
am
to
do
anything
i
can
to
help
you
for
miss
lawton
sake
ramon
hamilton
replied
eagerly
i
should
like
to
have
looked
into
the
matter
long
ago
indeed
i
felt
that
suspicion
must
have
been
aroused
in
the
minds
of
mallowe
and
his
associates
by
the
fact
that
i
accepted
the
astounding
news
of
the
bankruptcy
as
unquestioningly
as
miss
lawton
herself
unless
they
thought
me
an
addlepated
fool
but
i
did
want
to
go
ahead
without
direct
instructions
from
you
i
did
not
so
direct
you
hamilton
for
a
distinct
purpose
i
wished
the
men
we
believe
to
be
responsible
for
the
present
conditions
to
be
slightly
puzzled
by
your
attitude
so
that
when
the
time
came
for
you
to
begin
your
investigation
they
would
be
more
completely
reassured
in
order
to
make
your
questioning
absolutely
bona
fide
i
want
you
to
go
first
this
morning
to
the
office
of
anderson
wallace
the
late
lawton
attorneys
and
question
them
as
if
having
come
with
miss
lawton
authority
do
suggest
any
suspicion
of
there
being
any
crookedness
at
work
but
merely
inquire
as
fully
as
possible
into
the
details
of
lawton
business
affairs
they
will
in
their
replies
undoubtedly
bring
in
mallowe
rockamore
and
carlis
which
will
give
you
a
cue
to
go
quite
openly
and
frankly
to
one
of
the
three
preferably
mallowe
for
corroboration
knowing
that
you
come
direct
from
the
late
lawton
attorneys
he
will
be
only
too
glad
to
give
you
whatever
information
he
may
possess
or
may
have
concocted
and
so
lay
open
to
you
his
plan
of
defense
defense
you
think
then
blaine
that
they
anticipate
possible
trouble
exposure
even
surely
such
astute
men
as
mallowe
and
rockamore
are
at
least
would
not
have
attempted
such
a
gigantic
fraud
if
they
anticipated
the
possibility
of
being
discovered
carlis
has
weathered
so
many
storms
so
many
attacks
upon
his
reputation
and
civic
honor
that
he
may
have
felt
cocksure
of
his
position
and
gone
into
this
thing
without
thought
for
the
future
but
the
other
two
are
men
of
different
caliber
men
with
everything
in
the
world
to
lose
and
colossal
unearned
wealth
to
gain
do
forget
that
hamilton
men
of
different
caliber
i
grant
you
but
all
three
in
the
same
whirlpool
of
crime
bound
by
thieves
law
to
sink
or
swim
together
it
is
because
they
are
astute
and
that
they
must
inevitably
have
considered
the
possibility
of
exposure
and
safeguarded
themselves
against
it
with
bogus
corroborative
proof
if
that
proof
is
in
tangible
form
and
we
can
lay
our
hands
on
it
we
shall
have
them
where
we
want
them
now
go
back
to
your
office
hamilton
and
dictate
this
letter
to
your
stenographer
having
it
left
open
on
your
desk
for
your
signature
do
wait
for
the
letter
to
be
typed
but
proceed
at
once
to
the
office
of
anderson
wallace
you
as
a
lawyer
will
of
course
know
the
form
of
inquiry
to
use
the
detective
handed
ramon
hamilton
a
typewritten
sheet
of
paper
from
his
desk
and
the
young
man
after
hastily
perusing
it
gazed
with
a
blank
stare
of
amazement
into
blaine
eyes
i
ca
make
this
out
he
objected
who
on
earth
is
alexander
gibbs
and
what
has
he
to
do
with
miss
lawton
case
this
letter
seems
to
inform
one
alexander
gibbs
that
i
have
retained
you
to
recover
for
us
the
last
will
and
testament
of
his
aunt
dorothea
gibbs
i
have
no
such
client
and
i
know
no
one
in
what
the
address
ellenville
sullivan
county
blaine
smiled
of
course
you
do
hamilton
nevertheless
you
will
sign
that
letter
and
your
secretary
will
mail
it
that
is
after
it
has
lain
open
upon
your
desk
for
casual
inspection
for
a
considerable
length
of
time
one
of
my
operatives
will
receive
it
in
ellenville
but
what
has
it
to
do
with
the
matter
in
hand
ramon
asked
everything
i
understand
that
you
employ
quite
an
office
force
for
an
attorney
who
has
so
recently
been
admitted
to
the
bar
and
who
has
necessarily
had
little
time
yet
to
build
up
an
extensive
practice
there
may
be
a
spy
in
your
office
remember
that
as
miss
fiancé
and
her
only
protector
in
this
crisis
you
are
the
one
whom
they
would
safeguard
themselves
against
primarily
when
i
called
you
up
this
morning
to
ask
you
to
come
here
you
very
indiscreetly
mentioned
my
name
over
the
telephone
your
entire
office
force
will
know
that
you
have
been
to
consult
me
this
letter
will
throw
them
off
the
track
should
there
be
a
spy
among
them
and
will
also
give
you
a
legitimate
excuse
to
call
upon
me
frequently
in
the
immediate
future
you
realize
that
we
also
must
safeguard
ourselves
mr
hamilton
the
young
man
reddened
of
course
i
did
not
think
i
called
you
by
name
inadvertently
he
stammered
i
be
more
discreet
in
the
future
mr
blaine
memorize
the
gist
of
the
letter
on
your
way
to
your
office
particularly
the
name
and
address
and
place
it
securely
in
your
vest
pocket
when
you
have
left
your
office
to
go
to
anderson
wallace
destroy
it
carefully
you
had
best
perhaps
stop
in
the
lavatory
of
some
restaurant
or
public
bar
and
burn
it
or
tear
it
into
infinitesimal
pieces
remember
that
everything
depends
upon
you
now
upon
your
discretion
and
diplomacy
hamilton
followed
blaine
instructions
to
the
letter
and
an
hour
after
he
had
left
the
detective
he
was
closeted
with
the
senior
member
of
the
firm
of
anderson
wallace
my
dear
hamilton
we
have
had
so
little
time
anderson
expostulated
remember
that
lawton
death
occurred
little
more
than
a
fortnight
ago
and
even
the
most
cursory
examination
has
shown
us
that
his
affairs
were
in
a
most
chaotic
condition
it
will
take
us
weeks
months
to
settle
up
so
involved
an
estate
at
present
we
can
give
you
little
information
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
lawton
was
an
absolute
bankrupt
we
have
not
yet
assured
ourselves
that
nothing
can
be
saved
from
the
wreckage
you
can
not
imagine
how
aghast
thunderstruck
we
were
when
this
present
state
of
affairs
was
made
known
to
us
we
have
been
attorneys
for
more
than
twenty
years
and
we
thought
that
we
knew
every
detail
of
his
multifarious
transactions
but
for
some
reason
which
we
can
not
fathom
he
saw
fit
within
the
last
two
years
to
change
his
investments
without
taking
us
into
his
confidence
and
with
disastrous
results
lawton
was
always
conservative
he
took
no
one
fully
into
his
confidence
ramon
hamilton
replied
guardedly
you
knew
of
course
that
he
had
ideas
about
the
disposal
of
his
vast
wealth
which
many
other
financiers
would
consider
peculiar
he
would
never
invest
in
real
estate
to
our
knowledge
his
millions
were
placed
entirely
in
stocks
and
bonds
and
for
years
he
had
stated
that
his
object
was
in
the
event
of
his
death
to
save
his
daughter
and
the
trustees
from
unnecessary
trouble
over
matters
this
makes
his
later
conduct
all
the
more
inexplicable
mallowe
has
told
me
that
lawton
made
several
suggestions
to
him
and
to
his
associates
rockamore
and
carlis
to
go
with
him
into
the
unfortunate
speculations
which
ultimately
caused
his
ruin
they
were
enough
to
refuse
just
what
were
these
speculations
mr
anderson
i
ca
tell
you
at
this
moment
you
understand
that
we
do
wish
to
make
any
statement
until
we
can
do
so
definitely
and
we
are
still
as
i
said
quite
at
sea
we
try
to
straighten
everything
out
as
soon
as
possible
and
give
you
and
miss
lawton
a
full
report
in
the
meantime
why
not
consult
mallowe
he
can
give
you
more
explicit
information
concerning
the
late
lawton
speculation
and
final
insolvency
than
we
shall
be
able
to
do
for
some
time
or
possibly
rockamore
or
even
carlis
might
enlighten
you
all
three
seem
to
have
been
more
conversant
with
lawton
affairs
than
we
his
attorneys
the
dignified
old
gentleman
voice
held
a
note
of
pained
resentment
with
which
ramon
hamilton
could
not
help
but
sympathize
i
will
adopt
your
suggestion
anderson
and
call
upon
mallowe
at
once
i
can
no
more
understand
than
you
can
how
it
happens
that
lawton
should
have
confided
to
such
an
extent
in
his
business
associates
to
the
exclusion
of
you
and
wallace
to
say
nothing
of
his
own
daughter
but
doubtless
there
were
financial
reasons
which
we
learn
i
will
take
up
no
more
of
your
valuable
time
but
will
try
to
see
mallowe
immediately
if
i
learn
any
facts
you
not
now
in
possession
of
i
let
you
know
at
once
mallowe
when
approached
over
the
telephone
welcomed
most
cordially
the
proposed
interview
with
miss
lawton
fiancé
when
the
latter
arrived
he
was
greeted
with
a
warm
limp
and
seated
confidentially
close
to
the
president
of
the
street
railways
anderson
did
well
to
suggest
your
coming
to
me
hamilton
the
magnate
remarked
unctuously
i
believe
i
am
in
a
position
to
give
you
a
more
comprehensive
idea
of
the
circumstances
which
brought
about
my
esteemed
friend
unfortunate
financial
collapse
at
the
time
of
his
death
than
my
colleagues
because
i
was
closer
to
him
in
many
ways
and
i
am
confident
that
he
regarded
me
as
his
best
friend
however
i
do
feel
that
i
can
in
honor
violate
the
confidence
of
the
dead
by
giving
any
details
just
now
even
to
you
and
miss
lawton
of
matters
which
have
not
yet
been
fully
substantiated
by
the
attorneys
i
know
only
from
lawton
own
private
statements
that
he
was
interested
to
the
point
one
might
almost
say
of
mania
in
a
gigantic
scheme
from
which
we
his
friends
tried
in
vain
to
dissuade
him
he
urged
me
especially
to
go
in
on
it
with
him
but
because
of
the
very
position
i
hold
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
me
to
consider
it
even
if
my
better
judgment
had
warned
me
against
it
ca
you
give
me
some
idea
of
the
nature
of
this
scheme
ramon
asked
i
ca
believe
any
more
easily
than
miss
lawton
can
that
there
could
have
been
anything
that
was
not
thoroughly
open
and
about
her
father
dealings
surely
there
can
be
no
reason
for
this
extraordinary
secrecy
particularly
as
the
newspapers
had
given
to
the
world
at
large
the
unauthorized
statement
from
a
source
unknown
to
miss
lawton
or
myself
that
pennington
lawton
died
a
bankrupt
the
young
man
drew
himself
up
sharply
as
if
fearful
of
having
said
too
much
and
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
then
mallowe
leaned
back
easily
in
his
chair
and
removing
his
rimmed
eyeglasses
tapped
the
desk
thoughtfully
with
them
as
he
replied
that
was
regrettable
of
course
hamilton
it
must
have
been
distressing
in
the
extreme
to
miss
lawton
coming
just
at
this
time
but
it
would
have
had
to
be
revealed
sooner
or
later
you
know
such
a
stupendous
fact
could
not
be
hidden
there
is
no
extraordinary
secrecy
about
the
matter
when
the
attorneys
have
completed
their
settlement
of
the
estate
everything
will
be
clear
to
you
and
miss
lawton
i
must
naturally
decline
to
give
you
any
explanation
which
would
be
just
now
merely
an
uncorroborated
opinion
i
appreciate
your
feelings
in
this
sudden
almost
overwhelming
trouble
which
has
come
to
miss
lawton
and
i
sympathize
with
both
of
you
most
heartily
but
one
must
have
patience
you
will
pardon
me
but
you
are
both
very
young
and
that
is
the
hardest
lesson
of
all
for
you
to
learn
his
watery
eyes
beamed
in
fatherly
benevolence
upon
ramon
and
fiancé
felt
his
gorge
rising
the
older
man
reminded
him
irresistibly
of
a
cat
licking
its
chops
before
a
canary
cage
and
it
was
with
difficulty
he
restrained
himself
to
remark
coldly
you
told
me
at
the
beginning
of
this
interview
mallowe
that
i
did
well
in
coming
to
you
since
you
could
give
me
a
more
comprehensive
idea
of
the
circumstances
than
anyone
else
yet
you
have
disclosed
nothing
beyond
a
few
vague
suggestions
to
any
other
man
i
should
have
said
insinuations
and
generalities
which
we
were
already
familiar
with
ca
you
give
me
any
real
information
my
dear
boy
i
intend
to
tell
you
all
that
i
know
and
can
verify
the
silky
smoothness
of
the
magnate
tones
had
deepened
in
spite
of
himself
with
a
steely
undernote
i
do
know
when
the
project
which
spelled
his
ruin
was
first
conceived
by
lawton
but
i
believe
that
he
started
to
put
it
into
active
operation
over
three
years
ago
he
went
into
it
with
his
usual
cold
nerve
and
then
when
the
pendulum
did
not
swing
his
way
he
kept
heaping
more
and
more
of
his
securities
on
the
pyre
of
his
ambition
and
pride
in
himself
until
he
was
forced
to
obtain
large
loans
that
he
did
seek
and
obtain
such
loans
i
can
prove
to
you
at
the
present
moment
in
one
instance
at
least
for
it
was
through
me
the
affair
was
negotiated
i
think
he
fully
realized
his
enormous
error
but
refused
to
admit
it
even
to
himself
and
strove
by
sheer
force
of
to
carry
a
hopeless
scheme
to
success
sought
loans
he
pennington
lawton
required
loans
and
obtained
them
through
you
ramon
almost
started
from
his
chair
mallowe
you
will
forgive
me
but
i
can
scarcely
credit
it
i
know
of
course
that
financiers
even
those
who
conduct
their
operations
on
a
far
lesser
scale
than
lawton
frequently
seek
loans
but
your
manner
and
your
speech
just
now
led
me
to
believe
that
you
had
some
other
motive
in
doing
what
you
did
for
lawton
from
what
you
have
told
me
i
gather
that
it
was
owing
more
to
your
friendship
for
him
than
to
your
financial
relations
that
he
called
upon
you
at
that
time
and
it
was
to
my
friendship
at
that
time
that
he
appealed
mr
hamilton
appealed
i
can
not
imagine
pennington
lawton
appealing
to
any
man
why
should
he
appeal
to
you
because
my
dear
boy
he
was
in
a
mighty
bad
fix
when
he
had
need
to
call
upon
me
oh
by
the
way
i
have
the
letter
here
in
my
safe
i
found
it
only
the
other
day
the
letter
what
letter
the
letter
lawton
wrote
me
from
long
bay
asking
me
to
get
moore
help
in
the
matter
here
it
is
mallowe
went
to
his
safe
and
opening
it
withdrew
from
an
inner
drawer
a
paper
which
he
presented
to
the
young
lawyer
after
a
cursory
examination
ramon
placed
it
upon
the
desk
before
him
and
turning
to
mallowe
said
i
am
awfully
sorry
to
have
annoyed
you
with
this
matter
but
you
understand
exactly
how
miss
lawton
and
i
feel
about
it
of
course
hamilton
i
realize
the
situation
fully
i
am
glad
to
have
had
this
opportunity
to
explain
to
you
how
the
matter
stood
as
far
as
i
personally
was
concerned
you
know
i
will
do
anything
that
i
can
for
miss
lawton
and
i
trust
that
you
will
call
upon
me
he
rose
with
ponderous
significance
as
if
to
state
tacitly
that
the
interview
was
at
an
end
but
the
younger
man
did
not
stir
from
his
chair
this
letter
came
to
you
when
did
you
say
mr
mallowe
when
pennington
lawton
and
his
daughter
were
at
the
breakers
at
long
bay
about
two
years
ago
last
august
as
nearly
as
i
can
remember
if
you
still
had
the
envelope
we
could
obtain
the
exact
date
from
the
postmark
ramon
suggested
significantly
the
letter
i
see
is
only
headed
yes
it
is
unfortunate
that
i
did
not
keep
it
the
magnate
retorted
a
little
drily
it
was
by
the
merest
most
fortunate
chance
that
the
letter
itself
came
to
light
however
i
can
not
see
at
this
late
date
what
difference
it
could
possibly
make
when
the
letter
was
mailed
since
it
establishes
beyond
any
possibility
of
doubt
the
fact
that
it
mailed
as
to
the
matter
of
the
negotiation
of
the
loan
i
would
prefer
that
you
apply
to
moore
himself
for
the
particulars
concerning
it
i
am
sure
that
he
will
be
quite
as
glad
as
i
have
been
to
give
you
such
definite
information
as
he
possesses
this
time
the
dismissal
could
not
be
ignored
and
ramon
hamilton
took
his
departure
but
not
before
he
had
marked
well
the
particular
drawer
within
the
safe
from
which
the
letter
had
been
taken
as
he
went
down
the
corridor
a
saucy
young
woman
with
business
briskness
in
her
manner
came
from
an
inner
office
and
smiled
boldly
at
him
she
was
loretta
murfree
the
new
filing
clerk
who
had
been
installed
only
that
morning
in
mallowe
office
had
ramon
known
her
to
be
the
protégée
of
anita
lawton
and
the
spy
of
henry
blaine
he
might
have
glanced
at
her
a
second
time
the
young
man
proceeded
straight
to
the
offices
of
charlton
moore
the
banker
and
found
that
an
interview
was
readily
granted
him
moore
remembered
the
incident
of
the
loan
and
his
private
accounts
showed
that
it
had
been
made
on
the
sixteenth
of
august
two
years
previously
mallowe
arranged
the
matter
with
you
for
lawton
did
he
not
ramon
asked
yes
it
was
a
purely
confidential
affair
carlis
came
with
him
to
interview
me
they
did
not
at
first
tell
me
that
lawton
positively
desired
the
loan
but
they
made
tentative
arrangements
asking
if
i
would
be
in
a
position
to
give
it
to
him
should
he
desire
it
and
they
said
they
came
to
me
at
this
early
date
desiring
to
make
no
definite
statement
lawton
had
told
them
that
once
before
i
had
accommodated
him
by
carrying
a
note
confidentially
at
his
request
of
course
i
did
not
care
to
commit
myself
as
you
can
readily
understand
hamilton
until
i
was
assured
the
proposition
was
bona
fide
mallowe
and
carlis
suggested
that
i
call
lawton
up
on
the
private
wire
in
his
office
but
the
matter
was
so
delicate
that
as
long
as
he
had
not
come
to
me
in
person
i
did
not
care
to
telephone
him
mallowe
showed
me
a
letter
which
he
had
recently
received
from
pennington
lawton
corroborating
his
statement
but
in
the
matter
of
the
amount
desired
we
could
not
definitely
distinguish
the
figures
mallowe
was
sure
that
it
was
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
carlis
was
equally
certain
that
it
was
three
hundred
and
thousand
to
make
certain
of
the
matter
they
called
lawton
up
from
my
office
here
in
my
presence
and
he
stated
that
the
sum
desired
was
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
there
was
only
one
odd
thing
about
the
entire
transaction
and
that
was
a
remark
mallowe
made
as
he
was
leaving
after
the
negotiations
had
been
completed
he
turned
and
said
understand
moore
that
lawton
is
so
careful
so
secretive
that
he
does
not
wish
this
matter
ever
mentioned
to
him
personally
even
if
you
think
yourself
absolutely
alone
with
him
lawton
was
a
very
peculiar
man
in
many
ways
ramon
said
meditatively
his
methods
of
conducting
his
affairs
were
not
always
easily
understood
the
negotiations
were
then
completed
shortly
thereafter
yes
within
a
few
days
i
turned
the
amount
required
over
to
mallowe
and
carlis
and
accepted
lawton
note
i
will
show
it
to
you
if
you
care
to
see
it
that
will
not
be
necessary
moore
but
i
am
going
to
make
a
request
that
may
seem
very
strange
to
you
should
it
be
necessary
would
you
be
willing
to
show
that
note
to
some
one
whom
i
may
bring
here
to
you
some
one
who
may
prefer
not
to
see
you
personally
but
merely
to
be
permitted
to
examine
the
note
in
the
presence
of
some
responsible
people
of
your
own
choosing
certainly
hamilton
i
think
i
can
safely
promise
that
but
what
does
it
mean
is
there
anything
wrong
with
pennington
lawton
note
not
that
i
am
aware
of
moore
ramon
answered
laughing
rather
shortly
i
am
unable
to
explain
just
now
but
i
think
the
name
of
pennington
lawton
carries
with
it
a
sufficient
guarantee
that
the
note
will
be
honored
when
it
is
presented
an
hour
later
at
the
close
of
the
busiest
day
he
had
experienced
since
his
graduation
from
the
law
school
young
hamilton
presented
himself
at
henry
blaine
office
the
detective
listened
in
silence
to
his
story
and
at
its
conclusion
remarked
quietly
you
did
well
hamilton
i
am
going
to
call
one
of
my
operatives
and
ask
you
to
repeat
to
him
in
detail
the
location
of
that
safe
in
mallowe
office
and
the
drawer
which
contains
lawton
letter
from
long
bay
anyone
would
think
you
meant
to
steal
it
mr
blaine
young
hamilton
laugh
was
now
unrestrained
there
could
possibly
be
anything
wrong
with
the
note
or
the
entire
transaction
moore
proved
that
when
he
told
me
how
mallowe
and
carlis
called
up
lawton
in
his
presence
on
his
private
wire
and
discussed
the
negotiations
are
you
sure
that
they
did
mr
hamilton
the
detective
suddenly
leaned
forward
across
his
desk
his
body
tense
his
eyes
alight
with
fervid
animation
are
you
sure
pennington
lawton
ever
received
that
message
he
must
have
according
to
moore
the
two
men
used
private
wire
the
number
of
which
was
known
only
to
a
few
of
his
closest
intimates
and
which
of
course
was
not
listed
but
some
one
who
knew
that
the
telephone
message
was
coming
might
readily
have
been
in
lawton
office
seated
at
his
desk
alone
and
replied
to
it
in
the
financier
name
do
you
understand
hamilton
the
note
may
be
a
forgery
the
letter
may
be
a
forgery
that
we
shall
soon
know
if
it
is
and
the
money
so
obtained
from
moore
has
been
converted
to
the
use
of
the
three
confederates
whom
we
suspect
to
have
formed
a
conspiracy
to
ruin
miss
lawton
then
her
father
entire
fortune
might
have
been
seized
upon
in
virtually
the
same
way
henry
blaine
rose
and
paced
back
and
forth
as
if
almost
oblivious
of
the
other
presence
the
mortgage
of
his
was
forged
we
have
proved
that
he
continued
why
then
should
not
every
other
available
security
have
been
stolen
in
practically
the
same
way
he
continued
but
how
would
anyone
dare
the
whole
thing
is
too
ramon
expostulated
a
man
like
moore
could
not
have
been
imposed
upon
by
a
mere
forgery
but
if
that
note
proves
to
be
a
forgery
hamilton
and
the
letter
as
well
we
shall
have
picked
up
a
tangible
clue
at
last
i
think
i
am
beginning
to
see
daylight
late
that
night
in
the
huge
suite
of
offices
of
president
mallowe
of
the
street
railways
a
very
curious
scene
took
place
the
stolid
watchman
who
had
been
on
uneventful
duty
there
for
twenty
years
had
made
his
rounds
for
the
last
time
with
superb
nonchalance
he
settled
himself
for
his
accustomed
nap
in
his
employer
chair
from
the
stillness
and
gloom
of
the
two
stealthy
figures
descended
swiftly
upon
him
their
feet
sinking
noiselessly
into
the
rich
pile
of
the
rugs
a
short
silent
struggle
a
cloth
saturated
with
chloroform
pressed
heavily
over
his
face
and
the
guardian
of
the
premises
lay
inert
the
shorter
more
stocky
of
the
two
nocturnal
visitors
without
more
ado
switched
on
a
pocket
electric
light
and
made
a
hasty
but
thorough
survey
of
the
room
the
taller
one
shrank
back
inadvertently
from
the
body
in
the
chair
then
resolutely
turned
and
knelt
beside
his
companion
before
the
safe
he
dreaded
to
think
of
what
discovery
might
mean
if
he
ramon
hamilton
were
to
be
caught
in
the
act
of
burglarizing
his
career
as
a
rising
young
lawyer
would
be
at
an
end
the
risk
indeed
was
great
but
he
had
promised
henry
blaine
every
aid
in
his
power
to
help
the
girl
he
loved
after
a
minute
examination
the
operative
proceeded
to
work
upon
the
massive
safe
door
with
the
cunning
of
a
he
manipulated
the
tumblers
ramon
hamilton
his
discomfiture
forgotten
watched
with
breathless
interest
while
the
keen
sensitive
fingers
performed
their
task
soon
the
great
doors
swung
noiselessly
back
and
the
manifold
compartments
within
were
revealed
the
young
lawyer
pointed
out
the
drawer
from
which
he
had
seen
president
mallowe
remove
the
letter
that
morning
and
it
too
yielded
quickly
to
the
of
the
expert
there
on
the
very
top
of
a
pile
of
papers
lay
the
written
page
they
sought
he
be
all
right
we
have
done
for
him
have
we
ramon
hamilton
whispered
anxiously
pointing
to
the
watchman
unconscious
form
as
their
mission
accomplished
they
stole
from
the
room
surest
thing
you
know
he
come
to
in
half
an
hour
none
the
worse
the
operative
responded
we
made
a
good
clean
job
of
it
henry
blaine
could
hardly
suppress
his
elation
when
they
laid
the
letter
before
him
on
their
return
to
his
office
it
a
forgery
just
as
i
suspected
he
exclaimed
with
supreme
satisfaction
look
hamilton
i
show
you
how
it
was
done
it
is
incredible
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
i
know
pennington
lawton
handwriting
as
well
as
i
know
my
own
and
i
could
swear
that
his
fingers
guided
the
pen
his
writing
was
as
distinctive
as
his
character
it
that
very
fact
the
detective
returned
which
would
have
made
it
easier
to
copy
but
as
it
happens
you
are
partially
right
this
was
not
a
forgery
in
the
ordinary
sense
those
are
pennington
own
words
before
you
in
his
own
handwriting
then
how
the
young
lawyer
inquired
in
a
bewildered
tone
henry
blaine
smiled
you
do
not
intend
to
specialize
in
criminal
law
do
you
mr
hamilton
he
remarked
whimsically
if
you
do
you
will
have
to
be
up
in
the
latest
tricks
of
the
trade
the
man
who
forged
this
letter
the
same
man
by
the
way
forged
the
signature
on
that
mortgage
accomplished
it
like
this
he
took
a
bundle
of
old
letters
cut
out
the
actual
words
he
desired
and
pasted
in
their
proper
order
on
the
letter
paper
then
he
photographed
this
composite
and
electrotyped
it
that
is
transferred
it
to
a
copperplate
and
etched
it
then
he
it
and
in
this
way
got
an
actual
photograph
of
a
supposedly
authentic
communication
there
is
only
one
man
in
this
country
who
is
capable
of
such
perfect
work
i
know
who
that
man
is
and
where
to
find
him
then
if
you
can
locate
him
before
he
skips
and
make
him
talk
you
will
have
won
the
victory
ramon
exclaimed
jubilantly
but
the
detective
shook
his
head
the
time
is
not
yet
ripe
for
that
the
man
is
in
my
estimation
a
mere
tool
in
the
hands
of
the
men
higher
up
he
may
not
be
able
to
give
us
any
actual
proof
against
them
and
our
exposure
of
him
will
only
tip
them
off
put
on
their
guard
we
need
show
our
hand
just
yet
what
the
next
move
to
be
then
the
young
lawyer
asked
i
mean
of
course
that
i
wish
to
inquire
into
your
methods
of
handling
the
case
but
have
you
any
further
commissions
for
me
only
to
accompany
me
morning
to
the
office
of
charlton
moore
and
let
me
examine
that
note
which
lawton
presumably
gave
two
years
ago
afterward
i
have
four
little
amateur
detectives
of
mine
to
interview
then
i
think
we
be
able
to
proceed
straight
to
our
goal
the
note
also
as
henry
blaine
had
predicted
proved
to
be
a
forgery
and
to
have
been
executed
by
the
same
hand
as
the
letter
illustration
with
the
cunning
of
a
jimmy
valentine
he
manipulated
the
tumblers
ramon
hamilton
his
discomfiture
forgotten
watched
with
breathless
interest
the
detective
betrayed
to
the
unsuspecting
banker
no
sign
of
his
elation
at
the
discovery
but
following
their
interview
he
returned
to
his
office
and
sent
for
the
four
young
girls
whom
he
had
taken
from
the
anita
lawton
club
and
installed
in
the
offices
of
the
men
he
suspected
the
first
to
respond
was
margaret
hefferman
who
had
been
sent
as
stenographer
to
rockamore
the
promoter
you
followed
my
instructions
miss
hefferman
asked
blaine
you
kept
a
list
for
me
of
rockamore
visitors
yes
sir
i
have
it
here
in
my
bag
i
also
brought
carbon
copies
of
two
letters
which
rockamore
dictated
and
which
i
thought
might
have
some
bearing
on
the
matter
in
which
you
are
interested
although
i
could
not
quite
understand
them
myself
let
me
see
them
please
blaine
took
the
documents
and
list
of
names
scanning
them
quickly
and
sharply
with
a
practised
eye
the
names
were
those
of
the
biggest
men
in
the
city
bankers
brokers
financiers
and
promoters
among
them
that
of
president
mallowe
and
timothy
carlis
appeared
frequently
at
only
one
did
henry
blaine
pause
at
that
of
mark
paddington
he
had
known
the
man
as
an
employee
of
a
somewhat
shady
private
detective
agency
several
years
before
and
had
heard
that
he
had
later
been
connected
in
some
capacity
with
the
city
police
but
had
never
come
into
actual
contact
with
him
what
business
could
a
detective
of
his
caliber
have
to
do
with
bertrand
rockamore
the
letters
were
short
and
cryptic
in
their
meaning
and
significant
only
when
connected
with
those
to
whom
they
were
addressed
the
first
was
to
timothy
carlis
it
read
your
communication
received
we
must
proceed
with
the
utmost
care
in
this
matter
keep
me
advised
of
any
further
contingencies
which
may
arise
should
know
or
be
able
to
find
out
the
affair
is
to
his
interests
as
much
as
ours
the
second
was
addressed
to
paddington
have
learned
from
that
your
assistants
are
under
espionage
what
does
it
mean
learn
all
particulars
at
once
and
advise
you
have
done
well
miss
hefferman
said
blaine
as
he
looked
up
from
the
last
of
the
letters
i
will
keep
these
carbon
copies
and
the
list
let
me
know
how
often
mallowe
and
timothy
carlis
call
and
try
particularly
to
overhear
as
much
as
possible
of
the
man
paddington
conversation
when
he
appears
when
the
young
stenographer
had
departed
fifine
déchaussée
appeared
she
was
the
governess
who
had
been
sent
to
the
home
of
doctor
franklin
ostensibly
to
care
for
his
children
but
in
reality
to
find
if
possible
what
connection
existed
between
carlis
mallowe
rockamore
and
himself
the
young
frenchwoman
report
was
disappointingly
lacking
in
any
definite
result
save
one
fact
the
man
paddington
had
called
twice
upon
the
minister
remaining
the
second
time
closeted
with
him
in
his
study
for
more
than
an
hour
later
he
had
intercepted
her
when
she
was
out
with
the
children
in
the
park
but
she
had
eluded
his
attentions
i
wish
you
had
done
so
if
he
makes
any
further
attempt
to
talk
with
you
mademoiselle
déchaussée
encourage
him
draw
him
out
if
he
tries
to
question
you
about
yourself
and
where
you
came
from
mention
the
anita
lawton
club
but
remember
his
questions
carefully
and
come
and
tell
me
certainly
i
shall
remember
agnes
olson
and
laurette
murfree
the
switchboard
operator
to
carlis
and
filing
clerk
to
mallowe
respectively
added
practically
the
same
information
as
had
the
two
preceding
girls
mark
paddington
the
detective
had
been
in
frequent
communication
with
each
of
their
employers
when
the
young
women
had
concluded
their
reports
and
gone
blaine
telephoned
at
once
to
guy
morrow
his
operative
and
instructed
him
to
watch
for
paddington
appearance
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
little
house
in
the
bronx
where
they
had
located
brunell
the
forger
chapter
viii
guy
morrow
faces
a
problem
morrow
meanwhile
had
slowly
become
aware
that
he
had
a
problem
of
his
own
to
face
the
biggest
of
his
life
should
he
go
on
with
his
work
in
the
event
that
james
brunell
proved
indeed
to
be
guilty
of
the
forgeries
of
which
he
was
suspected
by
the
master
mind
it
would
mean
that
he
morrow
would
have
betrayed
the
father
of
the
girl
he
felt
himself
beginning
to
care
for
dared
he
face
such
a
tremendous
issue
his
acquaintance
with
emily
brunell
had
progressed
rapidly
in
the
few
days
since
his
subterfuge
had
permitted
him
to
speak
to
her
he
had
met
her
father
and
found
himself
liking
the
tall
silent
man
who
went
about
the
simple
affairs
of
his
life
with
such
compelling
dignity
and
courteous
aloofness
brunell
had
even
invited
him
to
his
little
shop
and
shown
him
with
unsuspecting
enthusiasm
his
process
for
making
the
maps
which
were
sold
to
the
public
schools
morrow
had
seen
no
evidence
of
anything
wrong
either
in
the
little
shop
or
the
home
life
of
the
father
and
daughter
nor
had
he
observed
paddington
who
was
well
known
to
him
in
the
neighborhood
even
in
these
few
mornings
it
had
become
a
habit
with
him
to
watch
for
emily
and
walk
with
her
to
her
subway
station
and
as
frequently
as
he
dared
he
would
await
her
arrival
in
the
evening
after
his
last
telephone
conversation
with
blaine
he
called
upon
the
two
in
the
little
house
across
the
way
determined
to
find
out
if
possible
if
the
man
paddington
had
come
into
their
lives
he
felt
instinctively
that
james
brunell
would
prove
a
difficult
subject
to
the
man
seemed
to
be
complete
master
of
himself
and
were
he
guilty
could
never
be
led
into
an
admission
unless
some
influence
more
powerful
than
force
could
be
brought
to
bear
upon
him
but
the
girl
with
her
clear
eyes
and
unsuspecting
inexperienced
mind
could
easily
be
led
to
disclose
whatever
knowledge
she
possessed
particularly
if
her
interest
or
affections
were
aroused
it
seemed
cowardly
in
view
of
his
newly
awakened
feelings
toward
her
but
he
had
committed
far
more
unscrupulous
acts
without
a
qualm
in
the
course
of
his
professional
work
brunell
was
out
when
he
called
but
emily
led
him
into
the
little
and
for
a
time
they
talked
in
a
desultory
fashion
morrow
who
had
brought
so
many
malefactors
to
justice
by
the
winning
snare
of
his
personality
felt
for
once
at
a
loss
as
to
how
to
commence
his
questioning
but
the
girl
herself
guilelessly
gave
him
a
lead
by
beginning
quite
of
her
own
accord
to
talk
of
her
early
life
it
seems
so
strange
she
remarked
confidingly
to
have
been
so
completely
alone
all
of
my
life
except
for
daddy
of
course
you
have
no
brothers
or
sisters
miss
brunell
asked
the
detective
none
and
i
never
knew
my
mother
she
died
when
i
was
born
morrow
sighed
and
involuntarily
his
hand
reached
forward
in
an
expression
of
complete
sympathy
daddy
has
been
mother
and
father
to
me
the
girl
went
on
impulsively
we
have
always
lived
in
this
neighborhood
ever
since
i
can
remember
and
of
course
we
know
everyone
around
here
but
with
my
downtown
position
and
father
work
in
the
shop
we
had
no
time
to
make
real
friends
and
we
have
even
cared
to
before
before
when
he
asked
with
a
kindly
intonation
not
at
all
in
keeping
with
the
purpose
which
had
actuated
him
in
seeking
her
friendship
before
you
brought
my
kitten
back
to
me
she
paused
suddenly
confused
and
shy
then
added
hurriedly
we
have
so
few
guests
you
know
daddy
somehow
does
care
for
people
as
a
rule
that
is
awfully
glad
that
he
has
made
an
exception
with
you
but
surely
you
have
other
friends
for
instance
that
young
fellow
i
noticed
now
and
again
when
he
called
upon
you
morrow
thoughts
had
suddenly
turned
to
that
unknown
visitor
toward
whom
he
had
taken
such
an
unaccountable
dislike
young
fellow
what
young
fellow
emily
brunell
voice
had
changed
slightly
and
a
reserved
little
note
intruded
itself
which
reminded
morrow
all
at
once
of
her
father
i
do
know
who
he
is
i
such
a
newcomer
in
the
neighborhood
you
know
but
i
happened
to
see
him
from
my
window
across
the
way
a
short
young
chap
with
a
small
dark
mustache
oh
man
her
lip
curled
disdainfully
that
charley
pennold
he
no
friend
of
mine
he
just
comes
to
see
father
now
and
again
on
business
i
do
bother
to
talk
to
him
i
do
think
daddy
likes
him
very
much
either
she
caught
her
breath
in
sharply
as
she
spoke
and
looked
away
from
morrow
in
sudden
reserve
he
felt
a
quick
start
of
suspicion
and
searched
her
averted
face
with
a
keen
penetrating
glance
if
this
charley
pennold
whoever
he
might
be
wished
to
see
james
brunell
on
legitimate
business
why
did
he
not
go
to
his
shop
openly
and
in
the
could
he
be
an
emissary
from
some
one
whom
the
old
forger
had
reason
to
evade
if
he
were
did
emily
know
for
what
purpose
he
came
and
was
she
annoyed
at
her
own
error
in
involuntarily
disclosing
his
name
he
is
a
too
leaped
from
morrow
lips
he
is
interested
in
maps
he
gives
daddy
large
orders
for
them
i
believe
emily
spoke
too
hurriedly
and
her
tones
lacked
the
ring
of
sincerity
which
was
habitual
with
them
the
trained
ear
of
the
detective
instantly
sensed
the
difference
and
his
heart
sank
so
she
had
lied
to
him
deliberately
and
her
womanly
instinct
told
her
that
he
knew
it
she
began
to
talk
confusedly
of
trivialities
and
morrow
seeing
that
it
would
be
hopeless
to
attempt
to
draw
her
back
to
her
unguarded
mood
left
her
soon
after
heartsick
and
dejected
should
he
continue
with
his
investigations
or
go
to
henry
blaine
and
confess
that
he
had
failed
him
was
this
girl
charming
and
innocent
as
she
appeared
worth
the
price
of
his
career
this
girl
with
the
blood
of
criminals
in
her
veins
who
would
stoop
to
lies
and
deceit
to
protect
them
yet
had
not
he
been
seeking
deliberately
to
betray
her
and
those
she
loved
under
the
guise
of
friendship
was
he
any
better
than
she
or
her
father
then
too
another
thought
came
to
him
might
she
not
be
the
tool
consciously
or
unconsciously
of
a
nefarious
plot
he
felt
that
he
could
not
rest
until
he
had
brought
his
investigations
to
a
conclusion
which
would
be
satisfactory
to
himself
even
if
he
decided
in
the
end
for
her
sake
never
to
divulge
to
henry
blaine
the
discoveries
he
might
make
a
few
days
later
however
morrow
received
instructions
from
blaine
himself
which
forced
his
hand
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
use
the
which
he
had
had
made
he
must
proceed
that
night
to
investigate
the
little
shop
of
the
and
look
there
for
the
evidence
which
would
incriminate
him
the
photographic
and
electrotyping
apparatus
early
in
the
evening
he
heard
emily
soft
voice
as
she
called
across
the
street
in
pleasant
greeting
to
miss
quinlan
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
go
out
upon
the
little
porch
and
speak
to
her
although
he
did
not
doubt
his
welcome
he
waited
until
all
was
dark
and
still
before
he
started
upon
his
distasteful
errand
it
was
very
cold
and
the
streets
were
deserted
a
fine
dry
snow
was
falling
which
obliterated
his
footprints
almost
as
soon
as
he
made
them
and
he
reached
the
now
familiar
door
of
the
little
shop
without
meeting
a
soul
abroad
save
a
lonely
policeman
dozing
in
a
doorway
he
let
himself
into
the
shop
with
his
key
and
flashed
his
pocket
lamp
about
all
appeared
the
same
as
in
the
the
maps
were
rolled
in
neat
cases
or
fastened
upon
the
wall
the
table
the
press
the
binder
were
each
in
their
proper
place
morrow
went
carefully
over
every
inch
of
the
room
and
the
curtained
recess
back
of
it
but
could
find
no
evidence
such
as
he
sought
at
length
however
just
before
the
little
desk
in
the
corner
where
james
brunell
kept
his
modest
accounts
the
detective
foot
touched
a
metal
ring
in
the
floor
stepping
back
from
it
he
seized
the
ring
and
pulled
it
a
small
square
section
of
the
flooring
yielded
and
the
raising
of
the
narrow
disclosed
a
worn
sanded
stone
stairway
leading
down
into
the
cellar
beneath
blaine
operative
listened
carefully
but
no
sound
came
from
the
depths
below
him
so
after
a
time
with
his
light
carefully
shielded
he
essayed
a
gingerly
descent
on
the
bottom
step
he
paused
there
was
small
need
for
him
to
go
further
he
had
found
what
he
sought
emily
brunell
father
was
a
forger
indeed
chapter
ix
gone
guy
morrow
after
a
sleepless
night
presented
himself
at
henry
blaine
office
the
next
morning
the
great
detective
observing
his
young
subordinate
with
shrewd
kindly
eyes
noted
in
one
swift
glance
his
changed
demeanor
his
pallor
and
the
new
lines
graven
about
the
firm
mouth
which
added
strength
and
maturity
to
his
face
if
he
guessed
the
reason
for
the
metamorphosis
blaine
gave
no
sign
but
listened
without
comment
until
morrow
had
completed
his
report
you
obeyed
my
instructions
he
asked
at
length
when
you
discovered
the
forgery
outfit
in
the
cellar
of
brunell
shop
you
left
everything
just
as
it
had
been
left
no
possible
trace
of
your
presence
yes
sir
there
not
a
sign
left
to
show
any
one
had
disturbed
the
place
i
am
sure
of
that
not
a
in
the
earth
of
the
cellar
steps
no
sir
and
the
outfit
was
there
any
evidence
it
had
been
used
lately
no
everything
was
and
even
rusty
as
if
it
had
not
even
been
touched
in
months
perhaps
years
the
whole
thing
might
be
merely
a
relic
of
jimmy
brunell
past
performances
in
the
life
he
gave
up
long
ago
morrow
spoke
almost
eagerly
as
if
momentarily
off
his
guard
but
blaine
shook
his
head
rather
too
dangerous
a
relic
to
keep
in
one
possession
guy
simply
as
a
souvenir
a
reminder
of
things
the
man
is
trying
to
forget
to
live
down
you
can
depend
on
it
the
outfit
was
there
for
some
more
practical
purpose
you
say
paddington
has
not
appeared
in
the
neighborhood
but
another
man
has
a
man
brunell
daughter
seems
to
dislike
and
fear
yes
sir
there
one
significant
fact
about
him
too
his
name
charley
pennold
it
did
occur
to
me
for
some
time
after
miss
brunell
let
that
slip
that
the
name
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
precious
pair
of
old
crooks
over

a
look
at
that
forgery

to
take
me
off
the
brunell
trail
morrow
astonishment
and
obvious
distaste
for
the
change
of
program
confronting
him
was
but
i
have
to
go
back
and
make
some
sort
of
explanation
for
leaving
so
abruptly
wo
i
will
it
pay
to
arouse
their
suspicions
that
is
sir
unless
you
got
some
special
reason
for
doing
so
blaine
slow
smile
was
very
kindly
and
sympathetic
as
he
eyed
the
anxious
young
man
before
him
no
you
will
go
back
of
course
and
explain
that
you
have
obtained
a
clerkship
which
necessitates
your
moving
downtown

your
peace
with
miss
brunell

you

put
you

on
the
job
there

a
few
days
and
i
know
i
can
depend
on
you
not
to
lose
your
head
she
a
young
girl
and
a
pretty
one
but
do
forget
she
the
daughter
of
jimmy
brunell
the
man
we
trying
to
get
pennington
lawton
had
a
daughter
too
remember
that
and
she
been
defrauded
of
everything
in
the
world
but
her
lover
and
her
faith
in
her
memory
his
voice
had
gradually
grown
deeper
and
more
stern
and
he
added
in
brisk
businesslike
tones
far
removed
from
the
personal
element
now
get
back
to
the
bronx
come
to
me
morning
and
i
have
the
data
in
the
paddington
matter
ready
for
you
the
young
detective
had
scarcely
taken
his
departure
when
ramon
hamilton
appeared
he
was
in
some
excitement
and
glanced
nervously
behind
him
as
he
entered
as
if
almost
in
fear
of
possible
pursuit
blaine
he
began
i
confident
that
we
suspected
here
a
note
that
came
to
me
from
president
mallowe
this
morning
he
asks
if
i
inadvertently
carried
away
with
me
that
letter
of
pennington
written
from
long
bay
two
years
ago
in
which
i
had
shown
such
an
interest
during
our
interview
the
other
day
he
has
been
unable
to
find
it
since
my
departure
that
a
rather
broad
hint
it
seems
to
me
i
should
not
consider
it
as
such
the
detective
responded
guilty
conscience
mr
hamilton
that
not
all
the
young
lawyer
went
on
he
says
that
a
curious
burglary
was
committed
at
his
offices
the
night
after
my
interview
with
him
his
watchman
was
chloroformed
and
the
safe
in
his
private
office
opened
and
rifled
yet
nothing
was
taken
with
the
possible
exception
of
that
letter
mallowe
asks
me
openly
if
i
knew
of
an
ulterior
motive
which
any
one
might
have
possessed
in
acquiring
it
and
even
remarks
that
he
is
thinking
of
putting
you
blaine
on
the
mysterious
attempt
at
robbery
that
would
be
a
joke
would
it
if
it
was
really
in
my
estimation
at
least
a
covert
threat
why
should
he
mallowe
take
me
into
his
confidence
about
an
affair
which
took
place
in
his
private
office
he
did
not
make
the
excuse
of
pretending
to
retain
me
as
his
attorney
i
think
he
was
merely
warning
me
that
he
was
suspicious
of
me
probably
a
mere
coincidence
blaine
observed
easily
i
wonder
if
you
think
so
when
i
tell
you
that
twice
since
yesterday
my
life
has
been
attempted
ramon
spoke
quietly
enough
but
there
was
a
slight
trembling
in
his
tones
what
blaine
started
forward
in
his
chair
then
sank
back
with
an
incredulous
smile
which
none
but
he
could
have
known
was
forced
surely
you
imagine
it
hamilton
since
your
automobile
accident
when
you
were
run
down
and
so
nearly
killed
on
the
evening
you
sent
for
me
to
undertake
miss
lawton
case
you
may
well
be
nervous
as
he
spoke
he
glanced
at
the
other
broken
arm
which
was
still
swathed
in
bandages
but
these
were
no
accidents
blaine
and
i
have
always
doubted
that
the
first
one
was
as
you
know
yesterday
afternoon
a
new
client
case
called
me
down
to
the
sixth
ward
at
four
in
order
to
reach
my
client
address
it
was
necessary
to
pass
through
the
street
in
which
that
shooting
affray
occurred
which
filled
the
papers
last
evening
two
men
darted
out
of
a
house
shot
presumably
at
each
other
then
turned
and
ran
in
opposite
directions
without
waiting
to
see
if
either
of
the
shots
took
effect
you
know
that
usual
with
the
members
of
rival
gangs
down
there
remember
too
blaine
that
it
was
prearranged
for
me
to
walk
alone
through
that
street
at
just
that
psychological
moment
it
seemed
to
me
that
neither
man
shot
at
the
other
but
both
fired
at
me
i
dismissed
the
idea
from
my
mind
as
absurd
the
next
minute
and
would
have
thought
no
more
about
it
beyond
congratulating
myself
on
my
fortunate
escape
had
not
the
second
attempt
been
made
the
sixth
ward
blaine
remarked
meditatively
that
timothy
carlis
stamping
ground
of
course
but
go
on
hamilton
what
was
the
second
incident
late
last
night
i
had
a
telephone
message
from
my
club
that
my
best
friend
gordon
brooke
had
been
taken
suddenly
ill
with
a
serious
attack
of
and
wanted
me
brooke
has
and
he
might
go
off
with
it
at
any
time
so
i
posted
over
immediately
the
club
is
only
a
few
blocks
away
from
my
home
so
i
did
wait
to
call
my
machine
or
a
taxi
but
started
over
just
a
little
way
from
the
club
three
men
sprang
upon
me
and
attempted
to
hold
me
up
i
fought
them
off
and
when
they
came
at
me
again
three
to
one
the
idea
flashed
upon
me
that
this
was
a
fresh
attempt
to
assassinate
me
i
shouted
for
help
and
then
ran
when
i
reached
the
club
i
found
brooke
there
sitting
in
a
poker
game
and
quite
as
well
as
usual
no
telephone
message
had
been
sent
to
me
from
him
i
tried
this
morning
before
i
came
to
you
to
have
the
number
traced
but
without
success
do
you
blame
me
now
blaine
for
believing
after
these
three
manifestations
that
my
life
is
in
actual
danger
i
do
not
the
detective
touched
an
electric
button
on
his
desk
i
think
it
will
be
advisable
for
you
to
have
a
guard
for
the
next
few
days
at
least
a
guard
ramon
repeated
indignantly
i
not
a
coward
any
man
would
be
disturbed
to
put
it
mildly
over
the
conviction
that
his
life
was
threatened
every
hour
but
it
was
of
her
i
was
thinking
of
anita
i
could
not
bear
to
think
of
leaving
her
alone
to
face
the
world
penniless
and
hedged
in
on
all
sides
by
enemies
but
i
want
no
guard
i
can
take
care
of
myself
as
well
as
the
next
man
look
at
the
perils
and
dangers
you
have
faced
in
your
unceasing
warfare
against
malefactors
of
every
grade
it
is
common
knowledge
that
you
have
invariably
refused
to
be
guarded
the
years
during
which
i
have
been
constantly
face
to
face
with
sudden
death
have
made
me
disregard
the
possibility
of
it
but
i
shall
not
insist
in
your
case
hamilton
if
you
do
not
wish
it
and
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
i
admire
your
spirit
however
i
should
like
to
have
you
leave
town
for
a
few
days
if
your
clients
can
spare
you
leave
town
run
away
ramon
started
indignantly
from
his
chair
but
blaine
waved
him
back
with
a
fatherly
hand
not
at
all
on
a
commission
for
me
in
miss
lawton
interests
hamilton
you
have
known
the
lawtons
for
several
years
have
you
not
ever
since
i
can
remember
the
young
lawyer
said
with
renewed
eagerness
two
years
ago
in
august
pennington
lawton
and
his
daughter
were
at
breakers
at
long
bay
were
they
not
yes
anita
and
i
were
engaged
then
and
i
ran
out
myself
for
the
i
want
you
to
run
out
there
for
me
now
the
hotel
will
be
closed
at
this
time
of
year
of
course
but
a
letter
which
i
will
give
you
to
the
proprietor
who
lives
close
at
hand
will
enable
you
to
look
over
the
register
for
an
hour
or
two
in
private
turn
to
the
arrivals
for
august
of
that
year
and
trace
the
names
and
home
addresses
on
each
page
then
bring
it
back
to
me
is
it
something
in
connection
with
that
forged
letter
to
mallowe
asked
ramon
quickly
perhaps
the
detective
admitted
he
shrugged
then
added
leniently
i
think
before
proceeding
any
further
with
that
branch
of
the
investigation
it
would
be
well
to
know
who
obtained
the
notepaper
with
the
hotel
letterhead
and
if
the
paper
itself
was
genuine
bring
me
back
some
of
the
hotel
stationery
also
that
i
may
compare
it
with
that
used
for
the
letter
a
discreet
knock
upon
the
door
heralded
the
coming
of
an
operative
in
response
to
blaine
touch
upon
the
bell
there
has
been
a
slight
disturbance
in
the
outer
office
sir
he
announced
a
man
who
appears
to
be
demented
insists
upon
seeing
you
he
is
one
of
the
ordinary
cranks
or
we
would
have
dealt
with
him
ourselves
he
says
that
if
you
will
read
this
you
will
be
glad
to
assent
to
an
interview
with
him
he
presented
a
card
which
blaine
read
with
every
manifestation
of
surprised
interest
tell
him
i
will
see
him
in
five
minutes
he
said
when
the
operative
had
withdrawn
the
detective
turned
to
ramon
who
do
you
think
is
waiting
outside
the
man
who
threatened
pennington
lawton
life
ten
years
ago
the
man
whose
name
was
mentioned
by
the
unknown
visitor
to
the
library
on
the
night
lawton
met
his
death
herbert
armstrong
good
heavens
ramon
exclaimed
what
brings
him
here
now
i
thought
he
had
disappeared
utterly
do
you
think
it
could
have
been
he
in
the
library
that
night
come
to
take
revenge
for
that
fancied
wrong
at
last
that
is
what
i
going
to
find
out
the
detective
responded
with
a
touch
of
grimness
in
his
tones
but
you
do
mean
it
is
possible
that
lawton
was
murdered
that
he
did
die
of
after
all
i
traced
armstrong
to
the
town
where
he
was
living
in
obscurity
and
followed
his
movements
blaine
reply
seemed
to
be
purposely
irrelevant
i
could
not
however
find
where
he
had
been
on
the
night
of
lawton
death
now
that
he
has
come
to
me
voluntarily
we
shall
discover
if
the
voice
miss
lawton
overheard
in
that
moment
when
she
listened
on
the
stairs
was
his
or
not
come
back
this
afternoon
hamilton
and
i
will
give
you
full
information
and
instructions
about
that
long
bay
errand
in
the
meantime
guard
yourself
well
from
a
possible
attack
although
i
do
not
think
another
attempt
upon
your
life
will
be
made
so
soon
take
this
and
if
you
have
need
of
it
do
not
hesitate
to
use
it
we
can
afford
no
now
shoot
and
shoot
to
kill
he
opened
a
lower
drawer
in
his
massive
desk
and
drawing
from
it
a
looking
revolver
of
large
caliber
presented
it
to
the
lawyer
with
a
warm
he
dismissed
him
and
going
to
the
telephone
called
up
anita
lawton
home
i
want
you
to
attend
carefully
miss
lawton
i
am
speaking
from
my
office
a
man
will
be
here
with
me
in
a
few
minutes
and
i
shall
seat
him
close
to
the
transmitter
of
my
leaving
the
receiver
off
the
hook
please
listen
carefully
to
his
voice
i
only
wish
you
to
hear
a
phrase
or
two
when
i
will
hang
up
the
receiver
and
call
you
up
later
try
to
concentrate
with
all
your
powers
and
tell
me
afterward
if
you
have
ever
heard
that
voice
until
now
if
it
is
the
voice
of
the
man
you
did
not
see
who
was
in
the
library
with
your
father
just
before
he
died
he
heard
her
give
a
quick
gasp
and
then
her
voice
came
to
him
low
and
sweet
and
steady
i
will
listen
carefully
blaine
and
do
my
best
to
tell
you
the
truth
the
detective
pulled
a
large
leather
chair
close
to
the
telephone
and
herbert
armstrong
was
ushered
in
the
man
was
pitiful
in
appearance
but
scarcely
demented
as
the
operative
had
described
him
he
was
tall
and
shabbily
clothed
gaunt
almost
to
the
point
of
emaciation
but
with
no
sign
of
dissipation
his
eyes
though
sunken
were
clear
and
they
gazed
levelly
with
those
of
the
detective
come
in
mr
armstrong
blaine
waved
genially
toward
the
what
can
i
do
for
you
the
man
did
not
offer
to
shake
hands
but
sank
wearily
into
the
chair
assigned
him
do
you
can
stop
hounding
me
henry
blaine
you
and
pennington
lawton
brought
my
tragedy
upon
me
as
surely
as
i
brought
it
upon
myself
and
now
you
will
not
leave
me
alone
with
my
grief
and
ruin
to
drag
my
miserable
life
out
to
the
end
but
you
or
your
men
must
dog
my
every
spy
upon
me
hunt
me
down
like
a
pack
of
wolves
and
why
why
the
man
voice
had
run
its
gamut
in
the
emotion
which
consumed
him
and
from
a
menacing
growl
of
protest
it
had
risen
to
a
shrill
wail
of
weakness
and
despair
henry
blaine
was
satisfied
excuse
me
armstrong
he
said
gently
the
receiver
is
off
my
telephone
here
at
your
elbow
it
would
be
unfortunate
if
we
were
overheard
if
you
will
allow
me
but
he
got
no
further
quick
as
he
was
the
other
man
was
quicker
he
sprang
up
furiously
and
dashed
the
telephone
off
the
desk
is
this
another
of
your
d
d
tricks
he
shouted
if
it
is
whoever
was
listening
may
hear
the
rest
you
and
pennington
lawton
between
you
drove
my
wife
to
suicide
but
you
not
drive
there
ruined
and
broken
and
hopeless
but
i
live
on
live
till
even
do
you
hear
live
till
i
square
with
the
game
his
violence
died
out
as
swiftly
as
it
had
arisen
and
he
sank
down
in
the
chair
his
face
buried
in
his
bony
hands
his
thin
shoulders
shaken
with
sobs
blaine
quietly
replaced
the
telephone
and
receiver
and
seated
himself
come
man
pull
yourself
together
he
said
not
unkindly
i
not
hounding
you
lawton
never
harmed
you
and
now
he
is
dead
he
was
my
client
and
i
was
bound
to
protect
his
interests
but
as
man
to
man
the
fault
was
yours
and
you
know
it
i
tried
to
keep
you
from
making
a
fool
of
yourself
and
wrecking
three
lives
but
i
only
succeeded
in
saving
one
but
your
men
are
hounding
me
following
me
shadowing
me
i
have
come
to
find
out
why
and
i
would
like
to
find
out
where
you
were
on
a
certain
night
last
month
the
ninth
to
be
exact
responded
blaine
quietly
what
affair
is
it
of
yours
the
other
man
asked
wearily
adding
how
should
i
know
now
one
night
is
like
another
to
me
if
you
hate
pennington
lawton
memory
as
you
seem
to
the
ninth
of
november
should
stand
out
in
your
thoughts
in
letters
of
fire
the
detective
went
on
in
even
quiet
tone
that
was
the
night
on
which
lawton
died
lawton
herbert
armstrong
raised
his
haggard
face
the
meaning
of
blaine
remark
utterly
failed
to
pierce
his
consciousness
the
date
does
mean
anything
to
me
but
i
remember
the
night
if
that
what
you
want
to
know
about
although
i
hanged
if
i
can
see
what
it
got
to
do
with
me
i
never
forget
that
night
because
of
the
news
which
reached
me
in
the
morning
that
my
worst
enemy
on
earth
had
passed
away
were
you
in
illington
the
evening
before
asked
blaine
i
was
not
i
was
in
new
harbor
where
i
live
playing
pinochle
all
night
long
with
two
other
like
myself
in
a
cheap
hall
i
herbert
armstrong
who
used
to
play
for
thousands
a
game
in
the
best
clubs
in
illington
and
i
never
knew
that
the
man
who
had
brought
me
to
that
pass
was
gasping
his
life
away
think
of
it
we
played
until
dawn
when
the
extras
cried
in
the
street
below
gave
us
the
news
if
you
will
give
me
the
address
of
this
you
mention
and
the
names
of
your
two
friends
i
can
promise
that
you
will
be
under
no
further
espionage
mr
armstrong
i
do
care
whether
you
know
it
or
not
if
that
all
you
want
the
gaunt
man
shrugged
wearily
i
tired
of
being
hounded
and
i
too
weak
and
too
tired
to
oppose
you
even
if
it
did
matter
he
gave
the
required
names
and
addresses
and
slouched
away
his
animosity
gone
and
only
a
dull
miserable
lethargy
sagging
upon
his
worn
body
when
the
outer
door
of
the
offices
had
closed
upon
him
henry
blaine
again
called
up
anita
lawton
this
time
her
voice
came
to
him
sharpened
by
acute
distress
i
did
not
recognize
the
tones
of
the
person
voice
blaine
only
i
am
quite
quite
sure
that
he
was
not
the
man
in
the
library
with
my
father
the
night
of
his
death
but
oh
what
did
he
mean
by
the
terrible
things
he
said
it
could
not
be
that
my
father
brought
ruin
and
tragedy
upon
any
one
much
less
drove
them
to
suicide
wo
you
tell
me
blaine
ramon
wo
although
i
am
convinced
he
knows
all
about
it
i
must
know
you
shall
miss
lawton
i
think
the
time
has
come
when
you
should
no
longer
be
left
in
the
dark
i
will
tell
hamilton
when
he
comes
to
me
this
afternoon
for
the
interview
we
have
arranged
that
you
must
know
the
whole
story
but
ramon
hamilton
failed
to
appear
for
the
promised
interview
henry
blaine
called
up
his
office
and
his
home
but
was
unable
to
locate
him
then
miss
lawton
began
making
anxious
inquiries
and
finally
the
mother
of
the
young
lawyer
appealed
to
the
detective
but
in
vain
late
that
night
the
truth
was
established
beyond
peradventure
of
a
doubt
ramon
hamilton
had
disappeared
as
if
the
earth
had
opened
and
engulfed
him
chapter
x
margaret
hefferman
failure
the
disappearance
of
ramon
hamilton
coming
so
soon
after
the
sudden
death
of
his
prospective
caused
a
profound
sensation
in
the
small
hours
of
the
night
before
the
press
had
been
apprised
of
the
event
and
when
every
probable
or
possible
place
where
the
young
lawyer
might
be
had
been
communicated
with
in
vain
henry
blaine
set
the
perfect
machinery
of
his
forces
at
work
to
trace
him
it
was
dawn
before
he
could
spare
a
precious
moment
to
go
to
anita
lawton
on
his
arrival
he
found
her
pacing
the
floor
wringing
her
slim
hands
in
anguish
he
is
dead
she
spoke
with
the
dull
hopelessness
of
utter
conviction
i
shall
never
see
him
again
i
feel
it
i
know
it
my
dear
child
blaine
put
his
hands
upon
her
shoulders
in
fatherly
compassion
you
must
put
all
such
morbid
fancies
from
your
mind
he
is
not
dead
and
we
shall
find
him
it
may
be
all
a
mistake
perhaps
some
important
matter
concerning
a
client
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
leave
the
city
over
night
she
shook
her
head
despairingly
no
blaine
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
ramon
is
just
starting
in
his
profession
he
has
no
clients
of
any
prominence
and
my
influence
was
really
all
that
his
rising
reputation
was
being
built
upon
besides
nothing
but
a
serious
accident
or
or
death
would
keep
him
from
me
if
he
had
met
with
any
accident
his
identity
would
have
been
discovered
and
we
would
be
notified
unless
as
in
the
case
when
he
was
run
down
by
that
he
did
not
wish
them
to
let
you
know
for
fear
of
worrying
you
blaine
watched
the
young
girl
narrowly
as
he
spoke
was
she
aware
of
the
two
additional
attempts
only
the
day
before
on
the
life
of
the
man
she
loved
he
merely
followed
a
dear
unselfish
impulse
because
he
knew
that
in
a
few
hours
at
most
he
would
be
with
me
but
now
it
is
morning
the
dawn
of
a
new
day
and
no
word
from
him
those
terrible
people
who
tried
to
kill
him
that
other
time
to
keep
him
from
coming
to
me
in
my
trouble
have
made
away
with
him
i
am
sure
of
it
now
the
detective
breathed
more
freely
evidently
ramon
hamilton
had
had
the
good
sense
to
keep
from
her
his
recent
danger
you
can
be
sure
of
nothing
miss
lawton
save
the
fact
that
hamilton
is
dead
henry
blaine
said
earnestly
you
do
not
realize
perhaps
the
one
salient
fact
that
criminal
experts
who
deal
with
cases
of
disappearance
have
long
since
recognized
the
most
difficult
of
all
things
to
conceal
or
do
away
with
in
a
large
city
is
a
dead
body
anita
shivered
and
clasped
her
hands
convulsively
but
she
did
not
speak
and
after
a
scarcely
perceptible
pause
the
detective
went
on
you
must
not
let
your
mind
dwell
on
the
possibilities
it
will
only
entail
useless
needless
suffering
on
your
part
my
experiences
have
been
many
and
varied
in
just
such
cases
as
this
and
in
not
one
in
fifty
does
serious
harm
come
to
the
subject
of
the
investigation
in
fact
in
this
instance
i
think
it
quite
probable
that
hamilton
has
left
the
city
of
his
own
accord
and
in
your
interests
in
my
interests
anita
repeated
roused
from
her
lethargy
of
sorrow
by
his
words
as
he
had
intended
that
she
should
be
left
the
city
but
why
when
he
called
upon
me
yesterday
morning
i
told
him
of
a
commission
which
i
wished
him
to
execute
for
me
in
connection
with
your
investigation
i
gave
him
some
preliminary
instructions
and
he
was
to
return
to
me
in
the
afternoon
for
a
letter
of
introduction
and
to
learn
some
minor
details
of
the
matter
involved
he
did
not
appear
at
the
hour
of
our
appointment
and
i
concluded
that
he
had
taken
the
affair
into
his
own
hands
and
had
gone
immediately
upon
leaving
my
office
to
fulfill
his
mission
oh
perhaps
he
did
the
young
girl
started
from
her
chair
her
dull
tearless
eyes
suddenly
bright
with
hope
that
would
be
like
ramon
he
is
so
impulsive
so
anxious
to
help
me
in
every
way
where
did
you
send
him
blaine
ca
we
telephone
or
wire
and
find
out
if
he
really
has
gone
to
this
place
please
please
do
i
can
not
endure
this
agony
of
uncertainty
of
suspense
much
longer
unfortunately
we
can
not
do
that
blaine
responded
gravely
to
attempt
to
communicate
with
him
where
i
have
sent
him
would
be
to
show
our
hand
irretrievably
to
the
men
we
are
fighting
and
undo
much
of
the
work
which
has
been
accomplished
he
may
communicate
with
you
or
possibly
with
me
if
he
finds
that
he
can
contrive
to
accomplish
it
safely
safely
then
if
he
has
gone
to
this
place
wherever
it
is
he
is
in
danger
anita
faltered
tremblingly
by
no
means
the
only
danger
is
that
his
identity
and
purpose
may
be
disclosed
and
our
plans
jeopardized
the
detective
reassured
her
smoothly
i
know
it
is
hard
to
wait
for
news
but
one
must
school
oneself
to
patience
under
circumstances
such
as
this
it
may
be
several
days
before
you
hear
from
hamilton
and
you
must
try
not
to
distress
yourself
with
idle
fears
in
the
meantime
but
it
is
not
certain
we
have
no
assurance
that
he
really
did
go
upon
that
mission
the
light
of
hope
died
in
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
and
a
little
sob
rose
in
her
throat
oh
blaine
promise
me
that
you
will
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
find
him
my
dear
child
you
must
trust
in
me
and
have
faith
in
my
long
years
of
experience
i
have
already
as
a
precautionary
measure
started
a
thorough
investigation
into
hamilton
movements
yesterday
and
in
the
event
that
he
has
not
gone
on
the
errand
i
spoke
of
it
can
only
be
a
question
of
hours
before
he
will
be
located
you
did
not
see
him
yesterday
no
he
promised
to
lunch
with
me
but
he
never
came
nor
did
he
telephone
or
send
me
any
word
surely
if
he
had
meant
to
leave
town
he
would
have
let
me
know
not
necessarily
miss
lawton
blaine
voice
deepened
persuasively
he
was
very
much
excited
when
he
left
my
office
interested
heart
and
soul
in
the
mission
i
had
entrusted
to
him
remember
too
that
it
was
all
for
you
for
your
sake
alone
and
i
may
not
know
where
he
has
gone
anita
asked
wistfully
i
think
perhaps
that
is
why
hamilton
did
not
communicate
with
you
before
leaving
town
the
detective
replied
significantly
he
agreed
with
me
that
it
would
be
best
for
you
not
to
know
in
your
own
interests
where
he
was
going
you
must
try
to
believe
that
i
am
doing
all
in
my
power
to
help
you
and
that
my
judgment
is
in
such
matters
better
than
yours
i
do
blaine
indeed
i
do
trust
you
absolutely
you
must
believe
that
she
reached
out
an
impulsive
hand
toward
him
and
his
own
closed
over
it
paternally
for
a
moment
then
he
gently
released
it
anita
sighed
and
sank
back
resignedly
in
her
chair
there
was
a
moment
pause
before
she
added
it
is
hard
to
be
quiescent
when
one
is
so
hedged
in
on
all
sides
by
falsehood
and
deceit
and
the
very
air
breathes
conspiracy
and
intrigue
i
have
no
tangible
reason
to
fear
for
my
own
life
of
course
but
sometimes
i
can
not
help
wondering
why
it
has
not
been
imperiled
surely
it
would
be
easier
for
my
father
enemies
to
do
away
with
me
altogether
than
to
have
conceived
and
carried
out
such
an
elaborate
scheme
to
rob
me
and
defame
my
father
memory
but
i
will
try
not
to
entertain
such
thoughts
i
am
nervous
and
overwrought
but
i
will
regain
my
in
the
meantime
i
shall
do
my
best
to
be
patient
and
wait
for
ramon
return
henry
blaine
felt
a
glow
of
pardonable
elation
but
his
usually
expressive
face
did
not
betray
by
a
single
flicker
of
an
eyelash
that
he
had
gained
his
point
he
knew
that
ramon
hamilton
had
never
started
on
that
mission
to
long
bay
but
if
the
young
health
and
reason
were
to
be
spared
her
anxiety
must
be
allayed
courageous
and
as
she
had
been
through
all
the
grief
and
added
trouble
which
besieged
her
on
every
hand
the
keen
insight
of
the
detective
warned
him
that
she
was
nearing
the
if
she
fully
realized
the
blow
which
threatened
her
in
the
sudden
disappearance
of
her
lover
together
with
the
sinister
events
which
had
immediately
preceded
it
she
would
be
crushed
to
the
earth
you
must
try
to
rest
blaine
rose
and
motioned
toward
the
window
through
which
the
cold
rays
of
the
wintry
sun
were
stealing
and
putting
the
orange
glow
of
the
electric
lights
to
shame
see
it
is
morning
and
you
have
had
no
sleep
but
you
must
not
go
just
yet
blaine
i
can
not
rest
until
i
know
who
that
man
was
whose
voice
i
heard
over
your
telephone
this
morning
what
did
he
mean
he
said
that
his
wife
committed
suicide
that
he
himself
had
been
ruined
and
all
through
my
father
and
you
it
can
not
be
true
of
course
but
i
must
know
to
what
he
referred
i
will
tell
you
it
is
best
that
you
should
know
the
truth
your
father
was
absolutely
innocent
in
the
matter
but
his
enemies
and
yours
might
find
it
expedient
to
spread
fake
reports
which
would
only
add
to
your
sorrow
you
know
you
must
remember
since
your
earliest
childhood
how
every
one
came
to
your
father
with
their
perplexities
and
troubles
and
how
benevolently
they
were
received
how
wisely
advised
how
generously
aided
not
only
bankers
and
financiers
in
the
throes
of
a
panic
but
men
and
women
in
all
walks
of
life
came
to
him
for
counsel
and
relief
i
know
i
know
anita
whispered
with
bowed
head
the
quick
tears
of
tender
memory
starting
in
her
eyes
such
a
one
who
came
to
him
for
advice
in
her
distress
was
the
wife
of
herbert
armstrong
she
was
a
good
woman
but
through
sheer
ignorance
of
evil
she
had
committed
a
slight
indiscretion
nothing
more
than
the
best
of
women
might
be
led
into
at
any
time
we
need
not
go
into
details
it
is
enough
to
tell
you
that
certain
unscrupulous
persons
had
her
in
their
power
and
were
blackmailing
her
she
fell
their
victim
through
the
terror
of
being
misunderstood
and
when
she
could
no
longer
accede
to
their
demands
she
came
to
your
father
her
husband
friend
for
advice
herbert
armstrong
was
insanely
jealous
of
his
wife
and
in
your
father
efforts
to
help
her
he
unfortunately
incurred
the
unjust
suspicions
of
the
man
armstrong
brought
suit
for
divorce
intending
to
name
lawton
as
corespondent
oh
how
could
he
anita
cried
indignantly
the
man
must
have
been
mad
my
father
was
the
soul
of
honor
every
one
the
whole
world
knows
that
besides
his
heart
was
buried
all
that
he
did
not
give
to
me
deep
deep
in
the
sea
where
mother
and
my
little
brother
and
sister
are
lying
he
never
even
looked
at
another
woman
save
perhaps
in
kindness
to
help
and
comfort
those
who
were
in
trouble
but
when
did
you
come
into
the
case
blaine
that
man
whose
voice
i
heard
must
have
been
herbert
armstrong
himself
of
course
why
did
he
say
that
you
as
well
as
my
father
were
responsible
for
his
tragedy
because
when
lawton
became
aware
of
armstrong
ungovernable
jealousy
and
the
terrible
length
to
which
he
meant
to
go
in
his
effort
to
revenge
himself
he
your
father
came
to
me
to
establish
armstrong
innocence
and
his
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
case
although
totally
wrong
from
every
standpoint
was
a
very
strong
one
but
fortunately
i
was
able
to
verify
the
truth
and
was
fully
prepared
to
prove
it
just
on
the
eve
of
the
date
set
for
the
trial
however
a
tragedy
occurred
which
brought
the
affair
to
an
abrupt
and
pathetic
end
a
tragedy
armstrong
suicide
you
mean
asked
anita
in
hushed
tones
how
awful
she
was
deeply
in
love
with
her
husband
his
unjust
accusations
and
the
public
shame
he
was
so
undeservedly
bringing
upon
her
broke
her
heart
i
assured
her
that
she
would
be
vindicated
that
armstrong
would
be
on
his
knees
to
her
at
the
trial
end
your
father
tried
to
infuse
her
with
courage
to
gird
her
for
the
coming
struggle
to
defend
her
own
good
name
but
it
was
all
of
no
use
she
was
too
broken
in
spirit
life
held
nothing
more
for
her
on
the
night
before
the
case
was
to
have
been
called
she
shot
herself
poor
thing
anita
murmured
with
a
sob
running
through
her
soft
voice
poor
persecuted
woman
why
did
she
not
wait
knowing
her
own
innocence
and
loving
her
husband
as
she
did
she
could
have
forgiven
him
for
his
cruel
suspicion
when
it
was
all
over
but
surely
herbert
armstrong
knows
the
truth
now
how
can
he
blame
you
and
my
father
for
the
wreck
which
he
made
of
his
own
life
because
his
mind
has
become
unhinged
he
was
always
excitable
and
erratic
and
his
weeks
of
jealous
wrath
culminating
in
the
shock
of
the
sudden
tragedy
and
the
realization
that
he
had
brought
it
all
on
himself
were
too
much
for
him
he
was
a
broker
and
one
of
the
most
prominent
financiers
in
the
city
but
with
the
divorce
fiasco
and
the
death
of
armstrong
he
began
to
brood
he
shunned
the
friends
who
were
left
to
him
neglected
his
business
and
ultimately
failed
sinking
lower
and
lower
in
the
scale
of
things
he
finally
disappeared
from
illington
you
can
understand
now
why
i
thought
it
best
when
you
told
me
of
the
conversation
you
had
overheard
in
the
library
here
a
few
hours
before
your
father
death
and
of
the
mention
of
herbert
armstrong
name
to
trace
him
and
find
out
if
it
was
he
who
had
come
in
the
heart
of
the
night
and
attempted
to
blackmail
mr
lawton
i
understand
that
was
why
you
wanted
me
to
hear
his
voice
yesterday
and
see
if
i
recognized
it
but
it
was
not
at
all
like
that
of
the
man
in
the
library
on
the
night
of
my
father
death
and
do
you
know
blaine
she
leaned
forward
and
spoke
in
still
lower
tones
when
i
recall
that
voice
it
seems
to
me
sometimes
that
i
have
heard
it
before
there
was
a
certain
timbre
in
it
which
was
oddly
familiar
it
is
as
if
some
one
i
knew
had
spoken
but
in
tones
disguised
by
rage
and
passion
i
shall
recognize
that
voice
when
i
hear
it
again
if
it
holds
that
same
note
and
when
i
do
blaine
darted
a
swift
glance
at
her
from
under
narrowed
brows
but
why
attribute
so
much
importance
to
it
he
asked
to
be
sure
it
may
have
some
bearing
upon
our
investigation
although
at
present
i
can
see
no
connecting
link
you
feel
perhaps
that
the
violent
emotions
superinduced
by
that
secret
interview
added
to
your
indirectly
caused
his
death
anita
again
sank
back
in
her
chair
i
do
know
blaine
i
can
not
explain
it
even
to
myself
but
i
feel
instinctively
that
that
interview
was
of
greater
significance
than
any
one
has
considered
as
yet
that
we
must
leave
to
the
future
the
detective
took
her
hand
and
this
time
anita
rose
and
walked
slowly
with
him
toward
the
door
there
are
matters
of
greater
moment
to
be
investigated
now
remember
my
advice
try
to
be
patient
yours
is
the
hardest
task
of
all
to
sit
idly
by
and
wait
for
events
to
shape
themselves
or
for
me
to
shape
them
but
it
must
be
if
you
can
calm
your
nerves
and
obtain
a
few
hours
sleep
you
will
feel
your
own
brave
self
again
when
i
report
to
you
as
i
shall
do
later
despite
his
night
of
ceaseless
work
henry
blaine
and
alert
of
brain
was
seated
at
his
desk
at
the
stroke
of
nine
when
suraci
was
ushered
in
the
young
detective
who
had
trailed
walter
pennold
from
brooklyn
to
the
quiet
backwater
where
jimmy
brunell
had
sought
in
vain
for
disassociation
from
his
past
shadowy
environment
it
has
become
necessary
through
an
incident
which
occurred
yesterday
for
me
to
change
my
plans
blaine
announced
i
had
intended
to
put
you
on
the
trail
of
a
young
crook
a
relative
of
pennold
but
i
find
i
must
send
you
instead
to
long
bay
to
look
up
a
hotel
register
for
me
and
obtain
some
writing
paper
with
the
engraved
from
that
hotel
you
can
get
a
train
in
an
hour
if
you
look
sharp
try
to
get
back
or
morning
at
the
latest
find
out
anything
you
can
regarding
the
visit
there
two
years
ago
last
august
of
pennington
lawton
and
his
daughter
and
of
other
guests
who
arrived
during
their
stay
here
are
your
instructions
twenty
minutes
conversation
ensued
and
suraci
took
his
departure
he
was
followed
almost
immediately
by
guy
morrow
what
is
the
dope
sir
the
latter
asked
eagerly
as
he
entered
there
an
extra
out
about
the
hamilton
disappearance
do
you
think
paddington
had
a
hand
in
that
i
want
you
to
tail
him
blaine
replied
find
out
anything
you
can
of
his
movements
for
the
past
few
weeks
but
lose
sight
of
him
for
a
minute
until
morning
he
supposed
to
be
working
up
the
evidence
now
for
the
snedecker
divorce
so
it
wo
be
difficult
for
you
to
locate
him
you
know
what
he
looks
like
yes
sir
i
know
the
man
himself
if
you
call
such
a
little
rat
a
man
we
had
a
once
and
it
is
likely
i
forget
him
then
be
careful
to
keep
out
of
his
sight
he
may
be
a
rat
but
as
as
a
ferret
i
rather
put
some
one
on
him
whom
he
did
know
but
we
have
to
chance
it
i
would
trust
this
to
anyone
but
you
guy
the
young
operative
flushed
with
pride
at
this
tribute
from
his
chief
and
after
a
few
more
instructions
he
went
upon
his
way
with
alacrity
once
more
alone
henry
blaine
sat
for
a
long
time
lost
in
thought
an
idea
had
come
to
him
engendered
by
a
few
vague
words
uttered
by
anita
lawton
in
the
early
hours
of
that
morning
an
idea
so
startling
so
tremendous
in
its
import
that
even
he
scarcely
dared
give
it
credence
to
put
it
to
the
test
to
prove
or
disprove
it
would
be
irretrievably
to
show
his
hand
in
the
game
and
that
would
be
suicidal
to
his
investigation
should
his
swift
suspicion
chance
to
be
groundless
the
sharp
ring
of
the
telephone
put
an
end
to
his
cogitations
he
put
the
receiver
to
his
ear
with
a
preoccupied
frown
but
at
the
first
words
which
came
to
him
over
the
wire
his
expression
changed
to
one
of
keenest
concentration
am
i
speaking
to
the
gentleman
who
talked
with
me
at
the
working
girls
club
a
clear
fresh
young
voice
asked
this
is
margaret
hefferman
rockamore
stenographer
that
is
i
was
until
ten
minutes
ago
but
i
have
been
discharged
discharged
blaine
voice
was
eager
and
crisp
as
he
reiterated
her
last
word
on
what
pretext
it
was
not
exactly
a
pretext
the
girl
replied
the
office
boy
accused
me
of
taking
shorthand
notes
of
a
private
conversation
between
my
employer
and
a
visitor
and
i
could
not
convince
rockamore
of
my
innocence
i
i
must
have
been
clumsy
i
afraid
you
have
the
notes
with
you
yes
the
visitor
name
was
paddington
yes
sir
blaine
considered
for
a
moment
then
his
decision
made
he
spoke
rapidly
in
a
clear
undertone
you
know
the
department
store
of
mead
rathbun
meet
me
there
in
the
ladies
in
half
an
hour
where
are
you
now
in
a
booth
in
the
just
around
the
corner
from
the
building
where
rockamore
offices
are
located
very
good
take
as
a
route
as
you
can
to
reach
mead
rathbun
and
see
if
you
are
followed
if
you
are
and
you
find
it
impossible
to
shake
off
your
shadow
do
not
try
to
meet
me
but
go
directly
to
the
club
and
i
will
communicate
with
you
there
later
oh
i
do
think
i
been
followed
but
i
be
very
careful
if
everything
is
all
right
i
will
meet
you
at
the
place
you
named
in
half
an
hour
henry
blaine
paced
the
floor
for
a
time
in
undisguised
perturbation
his
move
in
placing
inexperienced
girls
from
anita
lawton
club
in
responsible
positions
instead
of
using
his
own
trained
operatives
had
been
based
not
upon
impulse
but
on
mature
reflection
the
girls
were
unknown
whereas
his
operatives
would
assuredly
have
been
recognized
sooner
or
later
especially
in
the
offices
of
carlis
and
rockamore
moreover
the
ruse
adopted
to
obtain
positions
for
miss
lawton
protégées
had
appeared
on
the
surface
to
be
a
flawlessly
legitimate
one
he
had
counted
upon
their
loyalty
and
zeal
to
outweigh
their
possible
incompetence
and
lack
of
discretion
but
the
stolid
german
girl
had
apparently
been
so
clumsy
at
her
task
as
to
bring
failure
upon
his
plan
so
much
for
amateurs
he
murmured
to
himself
disgustedly
the
other
three
will
be
discharged
as
soon
as
excuses
for
their
dismissal
can
be
manufactured
now
my
only
hope
from
any
of
them
is
that
french
governess
if
she
will
only
land
paddington
i
do
care
what
suspicions
the
other
three
arouse
margaret
hefferman
placid
face
was
a
little
pale
when
she
greeted
him
in
the
ladies
room
of
the
department
store
a
short
time
later
i
so
sorry
mr
blaine
she
exclaimed
but
in
carefully
lowered
tones
i
could
have
cut
my
right
hand
off
before
i
would
hurt
miss
lawton
after
all
she
has
done
for
me
and
already
the
first
thing
she
asks
i
must
fail
to
do
you
are
sure
you
were
not
followed
asked
the
detective
disregarding
her
lamentations
with
purposeful
brusqueness
for
the
tears
stood
in
her
soft
bovine
eyes
and
he
feared
an
emotional
outburst
which
would
draw
down
upon
them
the
attention
of
the
whole
room
oh
no
i
made
sure
of
that
i
rode
uptown
and
down
again
to
be
certain
and
then
changed
to
the
line
very
well
he
drew
her
to
a
secluded
where
themselves
almost
unseen
they
could
obtain
an
unobstructed
view
of
the
entrance
door
and
of
their
immediate
neighbors
now
tell
me
all
about
it
miss
hefferman
it
was
that
office
boy
billy
she
began
such
sharp
eyes
and
soft
walk
like
a
cat
always
he
is
yawning
and
sleepy
who
would
think
he
was
a
spy
her
tone
was
filled
with
such
contempt
that
involuntarily
the
detective
mobile
lips
twitched
the
girl
had
evidently
quite
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
she
herself
had
occupied
the
very
position
in
the
pseudo
employ
of
bertrand
rockamore
which
she
derided
in
his
office
boy
he
did
not
attempt
to
guide
her
in
her
narrative
of
the
events
observing
that
she
was
too
much
agitated
to
give
him
a
coherent
account
instead
he
waited
patiently
for
her
to
vent
her
indignation
and
tell
him
in
her
own
way
the
substance
of
what
had
occurred
i
had
no
thought
of
being
watched
else
i
should
have
been
more
careful
she
went
on
resentfully
this
morning
only
he
was
late
that
billy
and
i
did
not
report
him
i
was
busy
too
for
there
was
more
correspondence
than
usual
to
attend
to
and
rockamore
was
irritable
and
in
the
midst
of
his
dictation
paddington
came
and
i
was
bundled
out
of
the
room
with
the
letters
and
my
shorthand
book
they
talked
together
behind
the
closed
door
for
several
minutes
and
i
had
no
opportunity
to
hear
a
word
but
presently
rockamore
called
billy
and
sent
him
out
on
an
errand
billy
left
the
door
of
the
inner
office
open
just
a
little
and
that
was
my
chance
i
seated
myself
at
a
desk
close
beside
it
and
took
down
in
shorthand
every
word
which
reached
my
ears
i
was
so
much
occupied
with
the
notes
that
i
did
not
hear
billy
footsteps
until
he
stopped
just
behind
me
and
whistled
right
in
my
ear
i
jumped
and
he
laughed
at
me
and
went
in
to
rockamore
when
he
came
out
he
shut
the
door
tight
behind
him
and
grinned
as
if
he
knew
just
what
i
had
been
up
to
i
did
not
dare
open
the
door
again
and
so
i
heard
no
more
of
the
conversation
but
i
have
enough
blaine
to
interest
you
i
think
she
fumbled
with
her
bag
but
the
detective
laid
a
detaining
hand
on
her
arm
never
mind
the
notes
now
go
on
with
your
story
what
happened
after
the
interview
was
over
that
boy
billy
went
to
rockamore
and
told
him
already
i
have
said
he
was
irritable
this
morning
he
had
seemed
nervous
and
excited
as
if
he
were
angry
or
worried
about
something
but
when
he
sent
for
me
to
discharge
me
he
was
with
rage
never
have
i
been
so
insulted
or
abused
but
that
would
be
nothing
if
only
i
had
not
failed
miss
lawton
for
her
sake
i
tried
to
lie
to
deny
but
it
was
of
no
use
my
people
were
good
lutherans
but
that
does
not
help
one
in
a
business
career
it
is
much
more
a
nuisance
he
could
read
in
my
face
that
i
was
guilty
and
he
demanded
my
shorthand
i
had
to
give
it
to
him
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
but
i
understood
that
you
had
the
notes
with
you
blaine
commented
then
paused
as
a
faint
smile
broke
over
her
face
and
a
demure
dimple
appeared
in
either
cheek
i
gave
to
him
a
she
explained
naïvely
he
was
quite
pleased
i
think
to
get
possession
of
it
no
one
can
read
my
shorthand
but
me
anyway
so
one
book
did
him
as
much
good
as
another
he
tried
to
make
me
tell
him
why
i
had
done
that
why
i
had
taken
down
the
words
of
a
private
conference
of
his
with
a
visitor
i
could
not
think
what
i
should
say
so
i
kept
silent
for
an
hour
he
bullied
and
questioned
me
but
he
could
find
out
nothing
and
so
at
last
he
let
me
go
if
now
i
could
get
my
hands
on
that
billy
never
mind
him
blaine
interrupted
rockamore
did
threaten
you
did
he
he
said
he
would
fix
it
so
that
i
obtained
no
more
positions
in
illington
the
girl
responded
sullenly
he
will
tell
miss
lawton
that
i
am
deceitful
and
treacherous
and
i
should
no
longer
be
welcome
at
the
club
he
said
but
i
will
not
take
up
your
so
valuable
time
by
repeating
his
stupid
threats
miss
lawton
will
understand
shall
not
i
read
the
notes
to
you
i
have
had
no
opportunity
to
transcribe
them
and
indeed
they
are
safer
as
they
are
yes
read
them
by
all
means
miss
hefferman
if
you
have
nothing
more
to
tell
me
i
do
not
think
we
are
being
overheard
by
anyone
but
remember
to
keep
your
voice
lowered
i
will
mr
blaine
the
girl
produced
the
from
her
bag
and
swept
a
practised
eye
down
its
cryptic
pages
here
it
is
these
are
the
first
words
i
heard
through
the
opened
door
they
were
spoken
by
rockamore
and
the
other
paddington
replied
this
is
what
i
heard
do
know
what
the
devil
you
driving
at
i
tell
you
do
you
rockamore
want
me
to
explain
i
go
into
details
if
you
like
hanged
if
i
interested
my
share
in
our
little
business
deal
with
you
was
concluded
some
time
ago
there
an
end
of
that
you
a
clever
enough
man
to
know
the
people
you
doing
business
with
paddington
you
ca
put
anything
over
on
us
not
trying
to
the
deal
you
spoke
of
is
over
and
done
with
and
i
guess
nobody
squeal
we
all
tarred
with
the
same
brush
but
this
is
something
quite
different
we
were
pretty
good
pals
rockamore
so
naturally
when
i
heard
something
about
you
which
might
take
a
lot
of
explaining
to
smooth
over
if
it
got
about
i
kept
my
mouth
shut
i
think
a
good
turn
deserves
another
at
least
among
friends
and
when
i
got
in
a
hole
i
remembered
what
i
did
for
you
and
i
thought
you
be
glad
of
a
chance
to
give
me
a
leg
up
other
words
you
come
here
with
a
vague
threat
and
try
to
blackmail
me
that
it
is
it
is
not
a
very
pleasant
term
rockamore
and
yet
it
is
something
which
even
you
might
attempt
get
me
of
course
the
others
would
be
glad
to
help
me
out
but
i
thought
i
come
to
you
first
since
i
well
i
know
you
better
much
do
you
want
ten
thousand
i
got
a
tip
on
the
market
and
if
i
can
raise
the
coin
before
the
stock
soars
and
buy
on
margin
i
make
a
fine
little
want
to
come
in
on
it
rockamore
to
the
devil
here

the
confidence
of
emily
all
during
that
day
and
the
night
which
followed
it
the
search
for
ramon
hamilton
continued
but
without
result
with
the
announcement
of
his
disappearance
in
the
press
the
police
had
started
a
spectacular
investigation
but
had
been
as
unsuccessful
as
henry
blaine
own
operatives
who
had
been
working
unostentatiously
but
tirelessly
since
the
news
of
the
young
lawyer
evanescence
had
come
no
one
could
be
found
who
had
seen
him
when
he
left
the
offices
of
the
great
detective
on
the
previous
morning
he
seemed
to
have
vanished
into
thin
air
it
was
to
blaine
the
most
baffling
incident
of
all
that
had
occurred
since
this
most
complex
case
had
come
into
his
hands
he
kept
his
word
and
called
to
see
anita
in
the
late
afternoon
he
found
that
she
had
slept
for
some
hours
and
was
calmer
and
more
hopeful
which
was
fortunate
for
he
had
scant
comfort
to
offer
her
beyond
his
vague
but
forceful
reassurances
that
all
would
be
well
early
on
the
following
morning
suraci
returned
from
long
bay
and
presented
himself
at
the
office
of
his
chief
to
report
here
are
the
tracings
from
the
register
of
breakers
which
you
desired
sir
he
began
spreading
some
large
thin
sheets
of
paper
upon
the
desk
the
lawtons
spent
three
weeks
there
at
the
time
you
designated
and
hamilton
went
out
each
from
friday
to
monday
as
you
can
see
here
and
here
they
had
no
other
visitors
and
kept
much
to
themselves
blaine
scanned
the
papers
rapidly
pausing
here
and
there
to
scrutinize
more
closely
a
signature
which
appeared
to
interest
him
at
length
he
pushed
them
aside
with
a
dissatisfied
frown
as
if
he
had
been
looking
for
something
which
he
had
failed
to
find
anything
suspicious
about
the
guests
who
arrived
during
the
stay
he
asked
was
there
any
incident
in
connection
with
them
worthy
of
note
which
the
proprietor
could
recall
no
sir
but
i
found
some
of
the
employees
and
talked
to
them
the
hotel
is
closed
now
for
the
winter
of
course
but
two
or
three
of
the
waiters
and
live
in
the
neighborhood
a
summer
resort
is
a
of
gossip
as
you
know
sir
and
since
lawton
sudden
death
the
servants
have
been
comparing
notes
of
his
visit
there
two
years
ago
i
found
the
waiter
who
served
them
and
two
and
they
each
had
a
curious
incident
to
tell
me
in
connection
with
the
lawtons
the
stories
would
have
held
no
significance
if
it
were
for
the
fact
that
they
all
happened
to
concern
one
person
a
man
who
arrived
on
the
eighth
of
august
this
man
here
suraci
ran
his
finger
down
the
register
page
until
he
came
to
one
name
where
he
stopped
abruptly
albert
addison
baltimore
maryland
read
blaine
then
with
a
sudden
exclamation
he
bent
closer
over
the
paper
a
prolonged
scrutiny
ensued
while
suraci
watched
him
curiously
reaching
into
a
drawer
the
master
detective
drew
out
a
powerful
magnifying
glass
and
examined
each
stroke
of
the
pen
with
minute
care
at
length
he
swung
about
in
his
chair
and
pressed
the
electric
button
on
the
corner
of
the
desk
when
his
secretary
appeared
in
response
to
the
summons
blaine
said
ask
the
filing
clerk
to
look
in
the
drawer
marked
and
bring
me
the
check
drawn
on
the
first
national
bank
signed
while
the
secretary
was
fulfilling
his
task
the
two
waited
in
silence
but
with
the
check
before
him
henry
blaine
gave
it
one
keen
comparing
glance
then
turned
to
the
operative
well
suraci
what
did
you
learn
from
the
hotel
employees
one
of
the
told
me
that
this
man
addison
arrived
with
only
a
bag
announcing
that
his
luggage
would
be
along
later
and
that
he
anticipated
remaining
a
week
or
more
this
boy
noticed
him
particularly
because
he
scanned
the
hotel
register
before
writing
his
own
name
and
insisted
upon
having
one
of
two
special
suites
number
or
the
suite
between
was
occupied
by
lawton
they
were
both
engaged
so
he
was
forced
to
be
content
with
number
just
across
the
hall
the
boy
noticed
that
although
the
new
arrival
did
not
approach
lawton
or
his
daughter
he
hung
about
in
their
immediate
vicinity
all
day
and
appeared
to
be
watching
them
furtively
late
in
the
afternoon
lawton
went
into
the
to
attend
to
some
correspondence
the
boy
passing
through
the
room
on
an
errand
saw
him
stop
in
the
middle
of
a
page
frown
and
tearing
the
paper
across
throw
it
in
the
glancing
about
inadvertently
the
saw
addison
seated
near
by
staring
at
lawton
from
behind
a
newspaper
which
he
held
in
front
of
his
face
as
if
pretending
to
read
the
boy
curiosity
was
aroused
by
the
eager
hungry
expectant
look
on
the
stranger
face
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
hang
around
too
and
see
what
was
doing
he
attended
to
his
errand
and
returned
just
in
time
to
see
lawton
seal
the
flap
of
his
last
envelope
rise
and
stroll
from
the
room
instantly
addison
slipped
into
the
seat
just
vacated
wrote
a
page
crumpled
it
and
threw
it
in
the
same
the
other
man
had
used
then
he
started
another
page
hesitated
and
finally
stopped
and
began
rummaging
in
the
basket
as
if
searching
for
the
paper
he
himself
had
just
dropped
there
the
boy
made
up
his
mind
he
a
sharp
one
sir
he
be
good
for
this
business
that
the
stranger
after
his
own
letter
at
all
but
the
one
lawton
had
torn
across
and
in
a
spirit
of
mischief
he
walked
up
to
the
man
and
offered
to
help
is
your
letter
sir
i
saw
you
crumple
it
up
just
now
that
torn
sheet
of
paper
belongs
to
one
of
the
other
guests
according
to
his
story
he
forced
addison
own
letter
on
him
and
walked
off
with
the
to
empty
it
and
if
looks
could
kill
he
have
been
a
dead
boy
after
one
glance
from
the
stranger
that
was
all
he
had
to
tell
and
he
would
have
remembered
such
a
trifling
incident
for
a
matter
of
two
years
and
more
if
it
had
been
for
something
which
happened
late
that
night
he
did
see
it
being
off
duty
but
another
boy
did
and
the
next
day
they
compared
notes
they
were
undecided
as
to
whether
they
should
go
to
the
manager
of
the
hotel
and
make
a
report
or
not
but
being
only
kids
they
were
afraid
of
getting
into
trouble
themselves
so
they
waited
addison
departed
suddenly
that
morning
however
and
as
lawton
never
gave
any
sign
of
being
aware
of
what
had
taken
place
they
kept
silent
i
located
the
second
boy
and
got
his
story
at
first
hand
his
name
is
johnnie
bradley
and
he
as
stupid
as
the
other
one
is
sharp
johnnie
was
on
all
night
and
about
one
he
was
sent
out
to
the
casino
on
the
pier
just
in
front
of
the
hotel
with
a
message
when
he
was
returning
he
noticed
a
tiny
bright
light
darting
quickly
about
in
lawton
rooms
as
if
some
one
were
carrying
a
candle
through
the
suite
and
moving
rapidly
he
remembered
that
lawton
and
his
daughter
had
motored
off
somewhere
just
after
dinner
to
be
gone
overnight
so
he
went
upstairs
to
investigate
without
mentioning
the
matter
to
the
clerk
who
was
dozing
behind
the
desk
in
the
office
there
was
a
chambermaid
on
night
duty
at
the
end
of
the
hall
but
she
was
asleep
and
as
he
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
johnnie
observed
that
some
one
had
contrary
to
the
rules
extinguished
the
lights
near
lawton
rooms
he
went
softly
down
the
hall
until
he
came
to
the
door
of
number
a
man
was
stooping
before
it
fumbling
with
a
key
but
whether
he
was
locking
or
unlocking
the
door
it
did
not
occur
to
johnnie
to
question
in
his
own
mind
until
later
as
he
approached
the
man
turned
saw
him
and
reeled
against
the
door
as
if
he
had
been
drinking
boy
he
drawled
matter
with
lock
ca
open
door
he
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
as
he
spoke
but
that
too
johnnie
did
not
think
of
until
afterward
is
your
door
sir
those
are
pennington
lawton
rooms
johnnie
told
him
is
the
number
on
your
key
the
man
produced
a
key
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
johnnie
in
a
stupid
dazed
sort
of
way
the
key
was
numbered
your
suite
just
across
the
hall
sir
johnnie
said
he
unlocked
the
door
for
the
newcomer
who
muttered
thickly
about
the
hall
being
d
d
confusing
to
a
stranger
and
gave
him
a
dollar
johnnie
waited
until
the
man
had
lurched
into
his
rooms
then
asked
if
he
wanted
receiving
no
reply
but
a
mumbled
curse
he
withdrew
but
not
before
he
had
seen
the
light
switched
on
and
the
man
cross
to
the
door
and
shut
it
the
stranger
no
longer
lurched
about
but
walked
erectly
and
his
face
had
lost
the
sagged
vapid
drunken
look
and
was
surprisingly
sober
and
keen
and
alert
the
two
boys
decided
the
next
day
that
addison
had
come
to
breakers
with
the
idea
of
robbing
lawton
but
as
i
said
nothing
came
of
the
incident
so
they
kept
it
to
themselves
and
in
all
probability
it
had
quite
passed
from
their
minds
until
the
news
of
lawton
death
recalled
it
to
them
suraci
paused
and
after
a
moment
blaine
suggested
tentatively
you
spoke
of
a
waiter
also
suraci
had
he
anything
to
add
to
what
the
had
told
you
of
this
man
addison
peculiar
behavior
yes
sir
it
is
very
important
but
it
sort
of
confirms
what
the
first
boy
said
about
the
stranger
trying
to
watch
the
lawtons
without
being
noticed
himself
by
them
the
waiter
tim
donohue
says
that
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
addison
was
seated
by
the
head
waiter
at
the
next
table
to
that
occupied
by
lawton
and
directly
facing
him
addison
entered
the
first
ordered
a
big
luncheon
and
was
through
it
when
the
lawtons
entered
no
sooner
were
they
seated
than
he
got
up
precipitately
and
left
the
room
that
night
at
dinner
he
refused
the
table
he
had
occupied
at
the
first
meal
and
insisted
upon
being
seated
at
one
somewhere
back
of
lawton
this
donohue
is
a
genial
soul
and
he
was
a
favorite
with
the
because
he
used
to
save
sweets
and
for
them
from
his
trays
johnnie
and
the
other
boy
told
him
of
their
dilemma
concerning
number
as
they
designated
addison
and
he
in
turn
related
the
incident
of
the
the
boys
told
me
about
him
and
where
he
could
be
found
he
not
a
waiter
any
longer
but
married
to
one
of
the
hotel
and
lives
in
long
bay
running
a
bus
service
to
the
depot
for
a
string
of
the
cheaper
boarding
houses
he
corroborated
the
story
in
every
detail
and
even
gave
me
a
hazy
sort
of
description
of
addison
he
was
small
and
thin
and
dark
clean
shaven
with
a
face
like
an
actor
narrow
shoulders
and
a
sort
of
chest
he
walked
with
a
slight
limp
and
was
a
little
for
the
exclusive
conservative
crowd
that
flock
to
breakers
that
our
man
suraci
that
paddington
to
the
life
blaine
exclaimed
i
knew
it
as
soon
as
i
compared
his
signature
on
this
check
with
the
one
in
the
register
although
he
has
tried
to
disguise
his
hand
as
you
can
see
i
glad
to
have
it
verified
though
by
witnesses
on
whom
we
can
lay
our
hands
at
any
time
should
it
become
necessary
he
left
the
day
after
his
arrival
you
say
the
morning
after
this
boy
johnnie
caught
him
in
front
of
lawton
door
yes
sir
the
do
think
he
came
back
either
they
remember
seeing
him
again
very
well
you
done
splendidly
suraci
i
could
have
conducted
the
investigation
better
myself
do
you
need
any
rest
now
oh
no
sir
i
quite
ready
for
another
job
the
young
eyes
sparkled
eagerly
as
he
spoke
and
his
long
slim
nervous
fingers
clasped
and
unclasped
the
arms
of
his
chair
spasmodically
what
is
it
something
new
come
up
only
that
disappearance
two
days
ago
of
the
young
lawyer
to
whom
miss
lawton
is
engaged
ramon
hamilton
i
want
you
to
go
out
on
that
at
once
and
see
what
you
can
do
i
got
half
a
dozen
of
the
best
men
on
it
already
but
they
have
accomplished
anything
i
give
you
a
single
clue
to
go
upon
except
that
when
he
walked
out
of
this
office
at
eleven
in
the
morning
he
wore
a
black
suit
black
shoes
black
tie
a
black
derby
and
a
gray
overcoat
with
a
mourning
band
on
the
sleeve
for
lawton
of
course
outside
the
door
there
he
vanished
as
if
a
trap
had
opened
and
dropped
him
through
into
space
no
one
has
seen
him
no
one
knows
where
he
went
that
all
the
help
i
can
offer
you
he
not
in
jail
or
the
morgue
or
any
of
the
hospitals
as
yet
that
is
much
but
it
something
here
a
personal
description
of
him
which
the
police
issued
yesterday
it
as
good
as
any
i
could
give
you
and
here
are
two
photographs
of
him
which
i
got
from
his
mother
yesterday
afternoon
take
a
good
look
at
him
suraci
fix
his
face
in
your
mind
and
then
if
you
should
manage
or
happen
to
locate
him
you
ca
go
wrong
i
know
your
memory
for
faces
the
shadow
departed
eagerly
upon
his
quest
and
blaine
settled
down
to
an
hour
deep
reflection
he
held
the
threads
of
the
major
conspiracy
in
his
hands
but
as
yet
he
could
not
connect
them
at
least
in
any
tangible
way
to
present
at
a
court
of
justice
where
everyone
from
the
judge
to
the
policeman
at
the
door
could
and
inevitably
would
be
bought
over
in
advance
to
the
side
of
the
criminals
it
was
a
fight
backed
only
with
the
slender
means
provided
by
a
young
girl
insignificant
financial
ventures
against
the
press
the
public
a
corrupt
political
machine
of
great
power
the
desperate
ingenuity
of
three
clever
unscrupulous
minds
brought
to
bay
and
the
overwhelming
influence
of
colossal
wealth
henry
blaine
felt
that
the
supreme
struggle
of
his
whole
career
was
confronting
him
the
intrepidity
of
conception
the
very
daring
of
the
conspiracy
combined
with
the
prominence
of
the
men
involved
would
brand
any
accusation
even
from
a
man
of
henry
celebrated
international
reputation
as
totally
preposterous
unless
substantiated
and
what
actual
proof
had
he
of
their
criminal
connection
with
the
alleged
bankruptcy
of
pennington
lawton
he
had
established
to
his
own
satisfaction
at
least
that
the
mortgage
on
the
family
home
on
belleair
avenue
had
been
forged
and
by
jimmy
brunell
the
signature
on
the
note
held
by
moore
the
banker
and
the
entire
letter
asking
mallowe
to
negotiate
the
loan
had
been
also
fraudulent
and
manufactured
by
the
same
hand
paddington
the
private
detective
with
perhaps
the
most
unsavory
record
of
any
operating
in
the
city
was
in
close
and
constant
communication
with
the
three
men
blaine
held
under
suspicion
and
probably
also
with
jimmy
brunell
lastly
brunell
himself
was
known
to
be
still
in
possession
of
his
paraphernalia
for
the
pursuit
of
his
old
nefarious
calling
paddington
on
margaret
hefferman
testimony
had
assuredly
succeeded
in
mulcting
the
promoter
rockamore
of
a
large
sum
in
a
clear
case
of
blackmail
but
on
the
face
of
it
there
was
no
proof
that
it
was
connected
with
the
matter
of
pennington
lawton
insolvency
the
mysterious
nocturnal
visitor
on
the
night
the
magnate
met
his
death
was
still
to
be
accounted
for
as
was
the
disappearance
of
ramon
hamilton
and
in
spite
of
his
utmost
efforts
henry
blaine
was
forced
to
admit
to
himself
that
he
was
scarcely
nearer
a
solution
or
rather
a
confirmation
of
his
steadfast
convictions
than
when
he
started
upon
his
investigation
unquestionably
the
man
paddington
held
the
key
to
the
situation
but
how
could
paddington
be
approached
how
could
he
be
made
to
speak
bribery
had
sealed
his
lips
and
only
greed
would
open
them
he
was
shrewd
enough
to
realize
that
the
man
who
had
purchased
his
services
would
pay
him
far
more
to
remain
silent
than
any
client
of
could
to
betray
them
moreover
he
was
in
the
same
boat
and
must
of
necessity
sink
or
swim
with
his
confederates
fear
might
induce
him
to
squeal
where
cupidity
would
fail
but
the
one
sure
means
of
loosening
his
tongue
was
through
passion
if
only
that
french
girl
fifine
déchaussée
would
lead
him
on
if
she
had
less
of
the
saint
and
more
of
the
coquette
in
her
we
might
land
him
the
detective
murmured
to
himself
it
dirty
work
but
we
got
to
use
the
weapons
in
our
hands
i
must
have
another
talk
with
her
before
she
considers
herself
affronted
by
his
attentions
and
throws
him
down
hard
that
is
if
he
making
any
attempt
to
follow
up
his
flirtation
with
her
blaine
soliloquy
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
guy
morrow
whose
face
bore
the
disgusted
look
of
one
sent
to
fish
with
a
bent
pin
for
a
salmon
i
found
paddington
all
right
sir
he
announced
i
tailed
him
until
a
ago
but
i
might
as
well
have
been
asleep
for
all
i
learned
except
one
fact
which
is
the
detective
asked
quickly
that
he
went
to
rockamore
office
yesterday
morning
remained
an
hour
and
came
away
with
a
check
for
ten
thousand
dollars
he
proceeded
to
the
bank
had
it
certified
and
deposited
it
at
once
to
his
own
account
in
the
merchants
and
traders
he
evidently
split
it
up
then
for
he
went
to
three
other
banks
and
opened
accounts
under
three
different
names
here
the
list
i
tailed
him
all
the
way
he
handed
the
master
detective
a
slip
of
paper
which
the
latter
put
carefully
aside
after
a
casual
glance
then
what
did
he
do
wasted
his
own
time
and
mine
the
operative
responded
in
immeasurable
contempt
ate
and
drank
and
gambled
and
loafed
and
philandered
philandered
blaine
repeated
sharply
in
the
park
returned
the
other
spooning
with
a
girl
rotten
cold
it
was
too
and
me
tailing
on
like
a
blamed
chaperon
after
he
made
his
last
deposit
at
the
third
bank
he
went
to
lunch
at
duyon
ate
his
head
off
and
paid
from
a
thick
wad
of
yellowbacks
then
he
dropped
in
at
wiley
and
played
roulette
for
a
couple
of
hours
played
in
luck
too
he
drank
quite
a
little
but
it
only
seemed
to
heighten
his
good
spirits
without
fuddling
him
to
any
extent
when
he
left
wiley
about
five
he
sauntered
along
court
street
until
he
came
to
fraser
the
jeweler
he
stopped
looked
at
the
display
window
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
as
if
on
a
sudden
impulse
turned
and
entered
the
shop
i
tailed
him
inside
and
went
to
the
men
counter
where
i
bought
a
keeping
my
eye
on
him
all
the
time
what
do
you
think
he
got
a
gold
locket
and
chain
a
locket
with
a
chip
diamond
in
the
center
the
eternal
feminine
blaine
commented
and
then
he
added
half
under
his
breath
fifine
déchaussée
on
the
job
what
sir
asked
the
operative
curiously
nothing
guy
merely
an
idle
observation
go
on
with
your
story
paddington
went
straight
from
the
jeweler
to
the
democratic
club
for
an
hour
then
dined
alone
at
rossi
i
was
on
the
for
the
woman
but
none
appeared
and
he
did
act
as
if
he
expected
anybody
after
dinner
he
strolled
down
belleair
avenue
past
the
lawton
residence
and
out
to
fairlawn
park
once
inside
the
gates
he
stopped
for
a
minute
near
a
and
looked
at
his
watch
then
hurried
straight
on
to
hydrangea
path
as
if
he
had
an
appointment
to
keep
i
dropped
back
in
the
shadow
but
tailed
along
she
must
have
been
late
that
girl
for
he
cooled
his
heels
on
a
bench
for
twenty
minutes
growing
more
impatient
all
the
time
finally
she
came
a
slender
wisp
of
a
girl
but
some
queen
plainly
dressed
dark
hair
and
eyes
small
hands
and
feet
and
a
face
like
a
window
they
walked
slowly
up
and
down
talking
very
confidentially
and
once
he
started
to
put
his
arm
about
her
but
she
moved
away
i
walked
up
quickly
and
passed
them
close
enough
to
hear
what
she
was
saying
course
it
is
lonely
for
a
girl
in
a
strange
country
where
she
has
no
friends
that
was
all
i
got
but
i
noticed
that
she
spoke
with
a
decidedly
foreign
accent
french
or
spanish
i
should
say
around
a
bend
in
the
path
i
hid
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
and
waited
until
they
had
passed
then
tailed
them
again
i
saw
him
produce
the
locket
and
chain
at
last
and
offer
them
to
her
she
protested
and
took
a
lot
of
persuading
but
he
prevailed
upon
her
and
she
let
him
clasp
it
about
her
neck
and
kiss
her
after
that
good
lord
they
spooned
for
about
two
hours
and
never
even
noticed
the
snow
which
had
begun
to
fall
while
i
shivered
along
behind
about
ten
they
made
a
and
he
left
her
at
the
park
gates
and
went
on
down
to
his
rooms
i
put
up
for
the
night
at
the
hotel
gaythorne
just
across
the
way
and
kept
a
but
there
were
no
further
developments
until
early
this
morning
at
a
little
after
seven
he
left
his
apartment
house
and
started
up
state
street
as
if
he
meant
business
of
course
i
was
after
him
on
the
jump
he
evidently
did
think
he
was
watched
for
he
never
looked
around
once
but
made
straight
for
a
little
shop
near
the
corner
of
tarleton
place
it
was
a
stationery
and
tobacco
store
and
i
was
right
at
his
heels
when
he
entered
he
leaned
over
the
counter
and
asked
in
a
low
meaning
tone
for
a
box
of
cairo
cigarettes
the
man
gave
him
a
long
searching
glance
then
turned
and
reaching
back
of
a
pile
of
boxes
on
the
first
shelf
drew
out
a
flat
one
the
size
which
holds
twenty
cigarettes
he
passed
it
quickly
over
to
paddington
but
not
before
i
observed
that
it
had
been
opened
and
rather
clumsily
resealed
paddington
handed
over
a
quarter
and
left
the
shop
without
another
word
he
went
directly
to
a
cheap
restaurant
across
the
street
and
ordering
a
cup
of
coffee
he
tore
open
the
cigarette
box
it
contained
only
a
sheet
of
paper
folded
twice
i
was
at
the
next
table
too
far
away
to
read
what
was
written
upon
it
but
whatever
it
was
it
seemed
to
give
him
immense
satisfaction
he
finished
his
coffee
returned
to
his
rooms
changed
his
clothes
and
went
directly
to
the
office
of
snedecker
the
man
whose
divorce
case
he
is
trying
to
trump
up
evidently
he
good
for
a
day
work
on
that
so
i
thought
i
could
safely
leave
him
at
it
and
report
to
you
humph
i
like
to
have
a
glimpse
of
that
communication
in
the
cigarette
box
but
it
is
of
sufficient
importance
on
the
face
of
it
to
show
our
hand
by
having
him
waylaid
or
searching
his
rooms
blaine
cogitated
aloud
i
put
another
man
on
morning
leave
the
address
of
the
tobacconist
with
my
secretary
on
your
way
out
and
if
there
is
another
message
he
get
it
first
you
need
do
anything
more
on
this
paddington
matter
i
think
the
other
end
needs
your
services
more
and
since
you
already
broken
ground
up
there
you
be
able
to
do
better
than
anyone
else
i
want
you
to
return
to
the
bronx
get
back
your
old
room
if
you
can
and
stick
close
to
the
brunells
back
in
his
old
rooms
at
quinlan
guy
sat
in
the
at
dusk
impatiently
awaiting
the
appearance
of
a
slender
figure
the
rain
which
had
set
in
early
in
the
afternoon
had
turned
to
sleet
and
as
the
darkness
deepened
the
rays
from
a
solitary
street
lamp
gleamed
sharply
upon
the
pavement
as
upon
an
unbroken
sheet
of
ice
presently
the
spare
form
of
james
brunell
emerged
from
the
gloom
and
disappeared
within
the
door
of
this
little
house
opposite
morrow
observed
that
the
man
step
lacked
its
accustomed
jauntiness
and
spring
and
he
plodded
along
wearily
as
if
utterly
preoccupied
with
some
depressing
meditation
a
light
sprang
up
in
the
front
room
on
the
ground
floor
but
after
a
few
moments
it
was
suddenly
extinguished
and
brunell
appeared
again
on
the
porch
he
closed
the
door
softly
behind
him
and
strode
quickly
down
the
street
there
was
a
marked
change
in
his
bearing
a
furtiveness
and
eager
haste
which
ill
accorded
with
his
manner
of
a
short
time
before
scarcely
had
brunell
vanished
into
the
encroaching
gloom
when
his
daughter
appeared
she
too
approached
wearily
and
on
reaching
the
little
sagging
gate
she
paused
in
surprised
dismay
at
the
air
of
detached
emptiness
the
house
seemed
to
exude
then
a
little
furry
object
scurried
around
the
porch
corner
and
precipitated
itself
upon
her
she
stooped
swiftly
gathered
up
the
kitten
in
her
arms
and
went
slowly
into
the
house
morrow
ate
his
supper
in
haste
and
as
soon
as
he
decently
could
he
made
his
way
across
the
street
emily
opened
the
door
in
response
to
his
ring
and
greeted
him
with
such
undisguised
pleasure
and
surprise
that
his
honest
heart
quickened
a
beat
or
two
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
voiced
the
plausible
falsehood
concerning
his
loss
of
position
and
return
to
his
former
abode
under
the
light
in
the
little
he
noticed
that
she
looked
pale
and
careworn
and
her
limpid
childlike
eyes
were
veiled
pathetically
with
deep
blue
shadows
as
he
looked
at
her
however
a
warm
tint
dyed
her
cheeks
and
her
head
drooped
while
the
little
smile
still
lingered
about
her
lips
you
are
tired
he
found
himself
asking
solicitously
after
she
had
expressed
her
sympathy
for
his
supposed
ill
fortune
you
found
your
work
difficult
at
the
club
oh
no
she
shook
her
head
slowly
my
position
is
a
mere
sinecure
thanks
to
miss
lawton
wonderful
consideration
i
have
been
a
little
depressed
a
little
worried
that
is
all
worried
morrow
paused
then
added
in
a
lower
tone
the
words
coming
swiftly
ca
you
tell
me
emily
is
there
some
way
in
which
i
can
help
you
what
is
it
that
is
troubling
you
i
i
do
know
a
deeper
painful
flush
spread
for
a
moment
over
her
face
then
ebbed
leaving
her
paler
even
than
before
you
are
very
kind
morrow
but
i
do
not
think
that
i
should
speak
of
it
to
anyone
and
indeed
my
fears
are
so
intangible
so
vague
that
when
i
try
to
formulate
my
thoughts
into
words
even
to
myself
they
are
unconvincing
almost
meaningless
yet
i
feel
instinctively
that
something
is
wrong
wo
you
trust
me
morrow
hand
closed
gently
but
firmly
over
the
girl
slender
one
in
a
clasp
of
compelling
sympathy
and
unconsciously
she
responded
to
it
i
know
that
i
am
comparatively
a
new
friend
you
and
your
father
have
been
kind
enough
to
extend
your
hospitality
to
me
to
accept
me
as
a
friend
you
know
very
little
about
me
yet
i
want
you
to
believe
that
i
am
worthy
of
trust
that
i
want
to
help
you
i
do
emily
more
than
you
realize
more
than
i
can
express
to
you
now
morrow
had
forgotten
the
reason
for
his
presence
there
forgotten
his
profession
his
avowed
purpose
everything
but
the
girl
beside
him
but
her
next
words
brought
him
swiftly
back
to
a
realization
of
the
present
so
swiftly
that
for
a
moment
he
felt
as
if
stunned
by
an
unexpected
blow
oh
i
do
believe
that
you
are
a
friend
i
do
trust
you
voice
thrilled
with
deep
sincerity
and
in
an
impetuous
outburst
of
confidence
she
added
it
is
about
my
father
that
i
am
troubled
something
has
happened
which
i
do
not
understand
there
is
something
he
is
keeping
from
me
which
has
changed
him
he
seems
like
a
different
man
a
stranger
you
are
sure
of
it
morrow
asked
slowly
you
are
sure
that
it
is
just
a
nervous
fancy
your
father
really
has
changed
toward
you
lately
not
only
toward
me
but
to
all
the
world
beside
she
responded
now
that
i
look
back
i
can
see
that
his
present
state
of
mind
has
been
coming
on
gradually
for
several
months
but
it
was
only
a
short
time
ago
that
something
occurred
which
seemed
to
bring
the
matter
whatever
it
is
to
a
i
remember
that
it
was
just
a
few
days
before
you
came
i
mean
before
i
happened
to
see
you
over
at
mrs
quinlan
she
stopped
abruptly
as
if
an
arresting
finger
had
been
laid
across
her
lips
and
after
waiting
a
moment
for
her
to
continue
morrow
asked
quietly
what
was
it
that
occurred
father
received
a
letter
it
came
one
afternoon
when
i
had
returned
from
the
club
earlier
than
usual
i
took
it
from
the
postman
myself
and
as
father
had
not
come
home
yet
from
the
shop
i
placed
it
beside
his
plate
at
the
supper
table
i
noticed
the
postmark
but
it
did
make
any
particular
impression
upon
me
it
was
only
later
when
i
saw
how
it
affected
my
father
that
i
remembered
and
wondered
he
had
scarcely
opened
the
envelope
when
he
rose
trembling
so
that
he
could
hardly
stand
and
coming
into
this
room
he
shut
the
door
after
him
i
waited
as
long
as
i
could
but
he
did
not
return
and
the
supper
was
getting
cold
so
i
came
to
the
door
here
it
was
locked
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
my
father
had
locked
himself
in
from
me
he
would
not
answer
me
at
first
as
i
called
to
him
and
i
was
nearly
frightened
to
death
before
he
spoke
when
he
did
his
voice
sounded
so
harsh
and
strained
that
i
scarcely
recognized
it
he
told
me
that
he
did
want
anything
to
eat
he
had
some
private
business
to
attend
to
and
i
was
not
to
wait
up
for
him
but
to
go
to
bed
when
i
wished
i
crept
away
and
went
to
my
room
at
last
but
i
could
not
sleep
it
was
nearly
morning
when
father
went
to
bed
and
his
step
was
heavy
and
dragging
as
he
passed
my
door
his
room
is
next
to
mine
and
i
heard
him
tossing
restlessly
about
and
once
or
twice
i
fancied
that
he
groaned
as
if
in
pain
he
was
up
in
the
morning
at
his
usual
time
but
he
looked
ill
and
worn
as
if
he
had
aged
years
in
that
one
night
neither
of
us
mentioned
the
letter
then
or
at
any
subsequent
time
but
he
has
never
been
the
same
man
since
and
the
letter
you
never
saw
it
morrow
asked
eagerly
his
detective
instinct
now
thoroughly
aroused
you
do
know
what
that
envelope
postmarked
contained
oh
but
i
do
emily
exclaimed
father
had
thrust
it
in
the
stove
but
the
fire
had
gone
out
without
his
noticing
it
i
found
it
the
next
morning
when
i
raked
down
the
ashes
you
read
it
morrow
carefully
steadied
his
voice
no
she
shook
her
head
with
a
faint
smile
that
the
queer
part
of
it
all
no
one
could
have
read
it
no
one
who
did
not
hold
the
key
to
it
i
mean
it
was
written
in
some
secret
code
or
cipher
with
oddly
shaped
figures
instead
of
letters
dots
and
cubes
and
triangles
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
before
i
could
understand
why
anyone
should
send
such
a
funny
message
to
my
father
instead
of
writing
it
out
properly
what
did
you
do
with
the
letter
did
you
destroy
it
this
time
the
detective
made
no
effort
to
control
the
eagerness
in
his
tones
but
the
girl
was
so
absorbed
in
her
problem
that
she
was
oblivious
to
all
else
i
suppose
i
should
have
but
i
did
i
knew
that
it
was
what
my
father
had
intended
yet
somehow
i
felt
that
it
might
prove
useful
in
the
future
that
i
might
even
be
helping
father
by
keeping
it
against
his
own
judgment
the
envelope
was
partially
scorched
by
the
hot
ashes
but
the
inside
sheet
remained
untouched
i
hid
the
letter
behind
the
mirror
on
my
dresser
and
sometimes
when
i
have
been
quite
alone
i
took
it
out
and
tried
to
solve
it
but
i
could
i
never
was
good
at
puzzles
when
i
was
little
and
i
suppose
i
lack
that
deductive
quality
now
i
was
ashamed
too
it
seemed
so
like
prying
into
things
which
did
concern
me
which
my
father
did
wish
me
to
know
still
i
was
only
doing
it
to
try
to
help
him
morrow
winced
and
drew
a
long
breath
then
resolutely
he
plunged
into
the
task
before
him
emily
do
think
that
i
want
to
pry
either
but
if
i
am
to
help
you
i
must
see
that
letter
if
you
trust
me
and
believe
in
my
friendship
let
me
see
it
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
discover
the
key
in
the
first
word
or
two
and
then
you
can
decipher
it
for
yourself
you
understand
i
do
wish
you
to
show
it
to
me
unless
you
really
have
confidence
in
me
unless
you
are
sure
that
there
is
nothing
in
it
which
one
who
has
your
welfare
and
peace
of
mind
at
heart
should
not
see
he
waited
for
her
reply
with
a
suffocating
feeling
as
if
a
hand
were
clutching
at
his
throat
a
hot
wave
of
shame
of
fierce
repugnance
and
at
the
rôle
he
was
forced
to
play
surged
up
within
him
but
he
could
not
go
back
now
the
die
was
cast
she
looked
at
him
a
long
searching
look
her
childlike
eyes
dark
with
troubled
indecision
at
length
they
cleared
slowly
and
she
smiled
a
faint
pathetic
smile
which
wrung
his
heart
then
she
rose
without
a
word
and
left
the
room
it
seemed
to
him
that
an
interminable
period
of
time
passed
before
he
heard
her
light
returning
footsteps
descending
the
stairs
a
wild
desire
to
flee
assailed
him
to
efface
himself
before
her
innocent
confidence
was
betrayed
emily
brunell
came
straight
to
him
and
placed
the
letter
in
his
hands
there
can
be
nothing
in
this
letter
which
could
harm
my
father
if
all
the
world
read
it
she
said
simply
he
is
good
and
true
he
has
not
an
enemy
on
earth
it
can
be
only
a
private
business
communication
at
the
most
my
father
life
is
an
open
book
no
discredit
could
come
to
him
yet
if
there
was
anything
in
the
cryptic
message
written
here
which
others
not
knowing
him
as
i
do
might
misjudge
i
am
not
afraid
that
you
will
you
see
i
do
believe
in
your
friendship
morrow
i
am
proving
my
faith
in
you
chapter
xii
the
cipher
it
was
a
haggard
young
man
who
presented
himself
at
henry
blaine
office
early
the
next
morning
with
his
report
the
detective
made
no
comment
upon
his
subordinate
changed
appearance
and
manner
but
eyed
him
keenly
as
with
dogged
determination
guy
morrow
told
his
story
through
to
the
end
the
letter
the
cipher
letter
blaine
demanded
curtly
when
the
operative
paused
at
length
you
have
it
with
you
morrow
drew
a
deep
breath
and
unconsciously
he
squared
his
shoulders
no
sir
he
responded
his
voice
significantly
steady
and
controlled
where
is
it
i
gave
it
back
to
her
to
miss
brunell
what
then
you
solved
it
the
detective
leaned
forward
suddenly
the
level
gaze
from
beneath
his
brows
seeming
to
pierce
the
younger
man
impassivity
no
sir
it
was
a
cryptogram
of
course
an
arrangement
of
cabalistic
signs
instead
of
letters
but
i
could
make
nothing
of
it
the
message
whatever
it
is
would
take
hours
of
careful
study
to
decipher
and
even
then
without
the
key
one
might
fail
i
have
seen
nothing
quite
like
it
in
all
my
experience
and
you
gave
it
back
to
her
blaine
exclaimed
with
incredulity
you
actually
had
the
letter
in
your
hands
and
relinquished
it
in
heaven
name
why
miss
brunell
had
shown
it
to
me
in
confidence
it
was
her
property
and
she
trusted
me
since
i
was
unable
to
aid
her
in
solving
it
i
returned
it
to
her
the
chances
are
that
it
is
as
she
said
a
matter
of
private
business
between
her
father
and
another
man
and
it
is
probably
entirely
dissociated
from
this
investigation
you
not
paid
morrow
to
form
opinions
of
your
own
or
decide
the
ethics
social
or
moral
of
a
case
you
put
on
you
paid
to
obey
instructions
collect
data
and
obtain
whatever
evidence
there
may
be
remember
that
confidence
or
no
confidence
girl
or
no
girl
you
go
back
and
get
that
letter
i
do
care
what
means
you
use
short
of
actual
murder
that
cipher
got
to
be
in
my
hands
before
midnight
understand
yes
sir
i
understand
morrow
rose
slowly
and
faced
his
chief
i
sorry
but
i
can
not
do
it
you
ca
that
the
first
time
i
ever
heard
that
word
from
your
lips
guy
henry
blaine
shook
his
head
sadly
affecting
not
to
notice
his
operative
rising
emotion
i
mean
that
i
wo
sir
i
sorry
to
appear
insubordinate
but
i
got
to
refuse
i
simply
must
i
never
shirked
a
duty
before
as
i
think
you
will
admit
blaine
i
have
always
carried
out
the
missions
you
entrusted
to
me
to
the
best
of
my
ability
no
matter
what
the
odds
against
me
and
in
this
case
i
have
gone
ahead
conscientiously
up
to
the
present
moment
but
i
wo
proceed
with
it
any
further
what
are
you
afraid
of
jimmy
brunell
asked
the
detective
significantly
the
insult
brought
a
deep
flush
to
morrow
cheek
but
he
controlled
himself
no
sir
he
responded
quietly
i
not
going
to
betray
the
trust
that
girl
has
reposed
in
me
how
about
the
trust
another
girl
has
placed
in
me
and
through
me
in
you
henry
blaine
rose
also
and
gazed
levelly
into
his
eyes
what
of
anita
lawton
have
you
considered
her
i
ought
to
dismiss
you
guy
at
this
moment
and
i
would
if
it
were
anyone
else
but
i
ca
allow
you
to
fly
off
at
a
tangent
and
ruin
your
whole
career
why
should
you
put
this
girl
emily
brunell
before
everything
in
the
world
your
duty
to
miss
lawton
to
me
to
yourself
she
trusted
me
returned
morrow
with
grim
persistence
so
did
henrietta
goodwin
in
the
case
of
derwenter
diamonds
so
did
the
little
manicure
in
the
verdun
blackmail
affair
so
did
anne
richardson
in
the
balazzi
kidnaping
mystery
you
made
love
to
all
of
them
and
got
their
confessions
and
if
your
scruples
and
remorse
kept
you
awake
nights
afterward
you
certainly
did
show
any
effect
of
it
what
difference
does
it
make
in
this
case
just
this
difference
blaine
morrow
words
came
with
a
rush
as
if
he
was
glad
now
that
the
issue
had
been
raised
to
meet
it
squarely
i
love
emily
brunell
whatever
her
father
is
or
has
done
she
is
guiltless
of
any
complicity
and
i
ca
stand
by
and
see
her
suffer
much
less
be
the
one
to
precipitate
her
grief
by
bringing
her
father
to
justice
i
told
you
the
truth
when
i
said
that
the
cipher
letter
was
an
enigma
to
me
i
could
not
solve
the
cryptogram
nor
will
i
be
the
means
of
bringing
it
to
the
hands
of
those
who
might
solve
it
i
do
want
any
further
connection
with
the
case
in
fact
sir
i
want
to
get
out
of
the
sleuth
game
altogether
it
a
dirty
business
at
best
and
it
leaves
a
bad
taste
in
one
mouth
and
many
a
black
spot
in
one
memory
i
realize
how
petty
and
sordid
and
treacherous
and
generally
despicable
the
whole
game
is
and
i
through
through
henry
blaine
smiled
his
quiet
slow
illuminating
smile
and
walking
around
the
table
laid
his
hand
on
morrow
shoulder
why
boy
you
have
even
commenced
detective
work
is
you
said
because
we
take
every
case
no
matter
how
insignificant
if
it
can
right
a
wrong
you
call
our
profession
because
we
accept
pay
for
the
work
of
our
brains
and
bodies
why
should
we
not
are
we
treacherous
because
we
meet
malefactors
and
fight
them
with
their
own
weapons
and
what
is
there
that
is
about
a
calling
which
betters
mankind
which
protects
the
innocent
and
brings
the
guilty
to
justice
morrow
shook
his
head
slowly
as
if
incapable
of
speech
but
it
was
evident
that
he
was
listening
and
blaine
after
a
moment
pause
followed
up
his
advantage
you
say
that
you
love
miss
brunell
guy
and
because
of
that
you
will
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
an
investigation
which
points
primarily
to
her
father
as
an
accomplice
in
the
crime
do
you
realize
that
if
you
throw
over
the
case
now
i
shall
be
compelled
to
put
another
operative
on
the
trail
with
all
the
information
at
his
disposal
which
you
have
detailed
to
me
you
may
be
sure
the
man
i
have
in
mind
will
have
no
sentimental
scruples
against
pushing
the
matter
to
the
end
without
regard
for
the
cost
to
either
jimmy
brunell
or
his
daughter
naturally
being
in
love
with
the
girl
her
interests
are
paramount
with
you
i
too
desire
heartily
to
do
nothing
to
cause
her
anxiety
or
grief
remember
that
i
have
daughters
of
my
own
as
i
have
told
you
i
firmly
believe
that
the
old
forger
is
merely
a
helpless
tool
in
this
affair
but
my
duty
demands
that
i
obtain
the
whole
truth
if
you
repudiate
the
case
now
give
up
your
career
and
go
to
work
to
attempt
to
protect
her
and
her
father
by
thwarting
my
investigation
you
will
be
doing
her
the
greatest
injury
in
your
power
the
only
way
to
help
them
both
is
to
do
all
that
you
can
to
discover
the
real
facts
in
the
case
when
we
have
succeeded
in
that
we
shall
undoubtedly
find
a
way
to
shield
old
jimmy
from
the
brunt
of
the
blame
do
forget
the
big
interests
political
and
municipal
at
work
in
this
conspiracy
they
would
not
hesitate
to
try
to
make
the
old
offender
a
and
you
know
what
sort
of
treatment
he
would
receive
in
the
hands
of
the
police
play
the
game
guy
stick
to
the
job
i
not
asking
this
of
you
for
my
own
investigation
i
have
a
dozen
a
score
of
operatives
who
could
each
handle
the
branch
you
are
working
up
just
as
well
as
you
i
ask
it
for
the
sake
of
your
career
for
the
girl
herself
and
her
father
i
tell
you
that
instead
of
incriminating
old
jimmy
you
may
be
the
means
of
ultimately
saving
go
back
to
emily
brunell
now
get
that
letter
from
her
by
hook
or
crook
and
bring
it
to
me
the
detective
paused
at
length
and
waited
for
his
answer
it
was
long
in
coming
guy
morrow
stood
leaning
against
his
desk
his
brows
drawn
down
in
a
troubled
frown
blaine
watched
the
outward
signs
of
his
mental
struggle
warily
but
made
no
further
plea
at
last
the
young
operative
raised
his
head
his
eyes
clear
and
resolute
and
held
out
his
hand
i
will
sir
thank
you
for
giving
me
another
chance
i
do
love
the
girl
and
i
want
to
help
her
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
but
i
play
the
game
fairly
you
are
right
of
course
i
can
be
of
more
assistance
to
her
on
the
inside
than
working
in
the
dark
and
it
would
be
better
for
everyone
concerned
if
the
truth
could
be
brought
to
light
i
get
the
letter
and
bring
it
to
you
morrow
was
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
subway
stairs
that
evening
when
emily
appeared
the
crisp
cold
air
had
brought
a
brilliant
flush
to
her
usually
pale
cheeks
and
her
sparkling
eyes
softened
with
tender
surprise
and
happiness
when
they
rested
on
him
he
thought
that
she
had
never
appeared
more
lovely
and
as
they
started
homeward
his
hand
tightened
upon
her
arm
with
an
air
of
unconscious
possession
and
pride
which
she
did
not
resent
may
i
come
over
after
supper
he
asked
softly
as
they
paused
at
her
gate
i
have
something
to
tell
you
to
ask
you
wo
you
come
in
and
have
supper
with
me
she
suggested
shyly
caliban
and
i
will
be
all
alone
my
father
will
not
be
home
until
late
he
telephoned
to
me
at
the
club
and
told
me
that
he
had
closed
the
shop
for
the
day
and
gone
on
business
a
shadow
crossed
her
face
as
she
spoke
the
faint
shadow
of
hidden
trouble
which
he
had
noticed
before
it
was
an
auspicious
moment
and
morrow
seized
upon
it
i
will
gladly
if
you
will
let
me
wash
the
dishes
he
replied
with
alacrity
we
will
do
them
together
the
brightness
which
but
an
instant
before
had
been
blotted
from
her
face
returned
in
a
warm
glow
and
side
by
side
they
entered
the
door
with
caliban
the
black
kitten
upon
his
knees
morrow
watched
as
she
moved
deftly
about
the
cheerful
spotless
kitchen
preparing
the
simple
meal
he
made
no
mention
of
the
subject
which
lay
nearest
his
heart
and
mind
and
they
chattered
as
gaily
and
irresponsibly
as
children
but
when
supper
was
over
and
they
settled
themselves
in
the
little
a
curious
constraint
fell
upon
them
both
she
sat
stroking
the
kitten
which
had
curled
up
beside
her
while
he
gazed
absently
at
the
rosy
gleam
of
the
glowing
coals
behind
the
isinglass
door
of
the
little
stove
and
for
a
long
time
there
was
silence
between
them
at
length
he
turned
to
her
and
spoke
emily
he
began
i
told
you
out
there
by
your
gate
that
i
had
something
to
ask
of
you
something
to
tell
you
i
want
to
tell
you
now
but
i
do
know
how
to
begin
it
something
i
never
told
any
girl
before
her
hands
paused
resting
with
sudden
tenseness
upon
caliban
soft
fur
and
slowly
she
averted
her
face
from
him
he
swallowed
hard
and
then
the
words
came
in
a
swift
tender
rush
dear
i
love
you
i
loved
you
from
the
moment
i
first
saw
you
coming
down
the
street
you
you
know
nothing
of
me
save
the
little
i
have
told
you
and
i
came
here
a
stranger
some
day
i
will
tell
you
everything
and
you
will
understand
you
and
your
father
admitted
me
to
your
friendship
made
me
welcome
in
your
home
and
i
shall
never
forget
it
it
may
be
that
some
time
i
shall
be
able
to
be
of
service
to
you
but
remember
that
whatever
happens
no
matter
how
you
reply
to
me
now
i
shall
never
forget
your
goodness
to
me
and
i
shall
try
to
repay
it
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
i
want
you
to
be
my
wife
dear
i
never
knew
before
that
such
love
could
exist
in
the
world
you
have
your
father
i
know
but
oh
i
want
to
protect
you
and
care
for
you
and
keep
all
harm
from
you
forever
guy
her
voice
was
a
mere
breathless
whisper
and
her
eyes
blurred
with
sudden
tears
but
he
slipped
his
arm
about
her
and
drew
her
close
emily
wo
you
look
at
me
dear
wo
you
tell
me
that
you
care
too
that
at
least
there
is
a
chance
for
me
if
i
have
spoken
too
soon
i
will
await
patiently
and
serve
you
as
jacob
served
for
rebecca
of
old
only
tell
me
that
you
will
try
to
care
and
there
is
nothing
on
this
earth
i
can
not
do
for
you
nothing
i
will
not
do
oh
my
darling
say
that
you
care
just
a
little
there
was
a
pause
and
then
very
softly
a
warm
arm
stole
about
his
neck
and
a
strand
of
rippling
brown
hair
brushed
his
cheek
lightly
as
her
gentle
head
drooped
against
his
shoulder
i
i
do
care
now
she
whispered
i
knew
that
i
cared
when
you
went
away
the
minutes
lengthened
into
an
hour
or
more
while
morrow
in
the
thrall
of
his
exalted
mood
forgot
for
the
second
time
in
the
girl
sweet
presence
his
battle
between
love
and
duty
forgot
the
reason
for
his
coming
the
mission
he
was
bound
to
fulfill
the
letter
he
had
promised
his
employer
to
obtain
for
many
minutes
guy
morrow
and
emily
forgot
all
else
but
the
happiness
of
the
love
they
had
just
confessed
for
each
other
morrow
had
even
forgotten
that
letter
which
after
many
misgivings
he
had
solemnly
promised
his
employer
to
obtain
from
emily
it
was
a
phrase
which
fell
from
her
own
lips
that
recalled
him
to
the
stern
reality
of
the
situation
my
father
she
exclaimed
starting
from
morrow
arms
in
sudden
confusion
what
do
you
suppose
father
will
say
we
will
tell
him
when
he
returns
morrow
spoke
with
reassuring
confidence
but
a
swift
feeling
of
apprehension
came
over
him
what
indeed
would
jimmy
brunell
say
the
thought
of
lying
to
emily
father
was
repugnant
beyond
expression
and
yet
what
account
could
he
give
of
himself
of
his
profession
and
earlier
career
what
credentials
what
proof
of
his
integrity
and
clean
honest
life
could
he
present
to
the
man
whose
daughter
he
sought
to
marry
at
the
first
hint
of
detective
the
old
forger
would
inevitably
suspect
his
motive
and
turn
him
from
the
house
forbidding
emily
to
speak
to
or
even
look
upon
him
again
there
was
an
alternative
and
although
he
shrank
from
it
as
unworthy
of
her
faith
and
trust
in
him
morrow
was
forced
to
accept
it
as
the
only
practicable
solution
to
the
problem
confronting
him
oh
no
do
let
us
tell
him
yet
unconsciously
emily
smoothed
the
way
for
him
i
do
mean
to
deceive
him
of
course
or
keep
anything
from
him
which
it
is
really
necessary
that
he
know
at
once
but
it
seems
too
wonderful
to
discuss
even
with
father
just
now
it
is
like
a
fairy
promise
like
moonshine
which
would
be
dispelled
if
we
breathed
a
word
of
it
to
anyone
of
course
dearest
if
it
is
your
wish
we
will
say
nothing
now
he
returned
slowly
in
his
heart
a
fierce
wave
of
at
his
own
hypocrisy
surged
up
once
more
but
he
forced
it
doggedly
down
he
had
promised
his
chief
to
play
the
game
and
after
all
it
was
for
the
sake
of
the
girl
beside
him
that
he
might
be
able
when
the
inevitable
moment
of
disclosure
came
to
be
of
real
service
to
her
and
her
unfortunate
father
and
to
shield
her
from
the
brunt
of
the
blow
i
should
not
like
your
father
to
think
that
we
deceived
him
but
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
if
we
kept
our
secret
for
a
little
time
later
when
i
have
succeeded
in
landing
a
good
permanent
position
with
a
prospect
of
advancement
i
can
go
to
him
with
greater
assurance
and
ask
him
for
you
poor
father
sighed
emily
with
a
wistful
tremulous
little
smile
we
have
been
inseparable
ever
since
i
can
remember
he
has
lived
only
for
me
and
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
leaving
him
especially
now
when
he
seems
weighed
down
with
some
secret
anxiety
which
he
will
share
with
no
one
not
even
me
i
feel
that
he
needs
me
more
than
ever
before
it
wrings
my
heart
guy
to
see
him
age
before
my
very
eyes
and
to
know
that
he
will
not
confide
in
me
i
may
not
help
him
he
seems
to
lean
upon
me
upon
my
presence
near
him
as
if
somehow
i
gave
him
strength
although
he
maintains
a
steadfast
silence
his
eyes
never
leave
me
and
such
a
sad
hungry
expression
comes
into
them
sometimes
almost
as
if
he
were
going
away
from
me
forever
as
if
he
were
trying
to
say
farewell
to
me
that
i
have
to
turn
away
to
hide
my
tears
from
him
poor
little
girl
it
must
make
you
terribly
unhappy
morrow
paused
and
then
added
as
if
in
afterthought
perhaps
when
we
tell
your
father
that
we
care
for
each
other
that
when
i
have
proved
myself
you
are
going
to
be
my
wife
he
may
confide
in
me
that
is
if
he
is
willing
to
give
you
to
me
you
know
dear
it
is
easier
sometimes
for
a
man
to
talk
to
another
of
his
private
worries
than
to
a
woman
even
the
one
nearest
and
dearest
to
him
in
all
the
world
i
may
possibly
be
of
assistance
to
him
you
told
me
last
night
that
the
change
in
him
had
been
coming
on
gradually
for
several
months
when
did
it
first
occur
to
you
that
he
was
in
trouble
i
do
know
i
ca
remember
you
see
i
did
realize
it
until
that
letter
came
and
then
i
began
to
think
back
and
the
significance
of
little
things
which
i
had
not
noticed
particularly
when
they
occurred
was
borne
in
upon
me
although
i
have
no
reason
for
connecting
the
two
happenings
beyond
the
fact
that
they
coincided
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
pennold
the
young
man
whom
you
have
observed
when
he
called
to
see
my
father
has
something
to
do
with
the
state
of
things
for
it
was
with
his
very
first
appearance
more
than
two
years
ago
that
my
father
became
a
changed
man
tell
me
about
it
morrow
urged
gently
can
you
remember
dear
when
he
first
came
oh
yes
we
have
so
few
visitors
father
does
as
a
rule
encourage
new
acquaintances
you
know
guy
although
he
did
seem
to
like
you
from
the
very
beginning
that
the
reception
of
a
perfect
stranger
into
our
home
as
a
constant
caller
puzzled
me
it
occurred
on
a
sunday
afternoon
in
summer
i
was
sitting
out
on
the
porch
reading
when
a
strange
young
man
came
up
the
path
from
the
gate
and
asked
to
see
my
father
i
called
to
him
he
was
weeding
the
flowerbed
around
the
corner
of
the
house
and
when
he
came
i
went
up
to
my
room
leaving
them
alone
together
i
did
go
though
until
i
had
seen
their
meeting
and
one
thing
about
it
seemed
strange
to
me
even
then
the
stranger
pennold
evidently
did
not
know
my
father
had
never
even
seen
him
before
from
the
way
he
greeted
him
but
when
father
first
caught
sight
of
his
face
his
own
went
deathly
white
and
he
gripped
the
porch
railing
for
a
moment
as
if
for
support
wished
to
see
me
he
said
and
his
voice
sounded
queer
and
hollow
and
dazed
like
a
person
awaking
from
sleep
can
i
do
for
you
is
james
brunell
the
young
man
asked
are
a
i
understand
i
have
come
to
ask
for
your
estimate
on
a
large
contract
for
for
suburban
schools
if
you
can
spare
a
we
can
talk
it
over
now
sir
in
private
i
have
a
letter
of
introduction
to
you
from
an
old
acquaintance
my
name
is
pennold
know
my
father
smiled
as
he
spoke
an
odd
slow
smile
which
somehow
held
no
mirth
or
welcome
noted
the
family
resemblance
at
once
a
relative
of
yours
was
at
one
time
associated
with
me
in
business
the
young
man
laughed
shortly
you
mean
my
uncle
i
guess
he
retired
now
well
brunell
shall
we
get
to
business
i
left
them
then
and
when
i
came
downstairs
from
my
room
the
young
man
had
gone
father
was
standing
in
the
window
over
there
with
a
letter
crushed
in
his
hand
he
turned
when
i
spoke
to
him
and
oh
guy
if
you
had
seen
his
face
at
that
moment
i
almost
cried
out
in
fear
it
was
like
one
of
the
terrible
despairing
faces
in
description
of
the
inferno
he
looked
at
me
blankly
as
if
he
scarcely
recognized
me
then
gradually
that
awful
expression
was
blotted
out
and
his
old
sweet
sunny
smile
took
its
place
little
girl
he
said
sunday
together
was
spoiled
was
it
by
that
young
fellow
intrusion
spoiled
i
replied
he
brought
you
work
the
smile
faded
from
father
face
and
he
responded
very
gravely
with
a
curious
halting
pause
between
the
words
he
has
brought
me
work
i
forgot
all
about
that
episode
in
the
weeks
and
months
which
followed
charley
pennold
called
irregularly
sometimes
he
would
come
three
or
four
times
a
week
then
again
we
would
not
see
him
for
two
or
three
months
father
was
busier
than
ever
in
the
shop
and
charley
pennold
orders
must
have
been
very
profitable
for
we
had
more
money
in
the
last
two
years
than
ever
before
that
i
can
remember
and
yet
father
has
been
melancholy
and
morose
at
times
as
if
he
were
brooding
over
something
and
his
disposition
has
changed
steadily
for
the
worse
although
in
the
last
few
months
the
difference
in
his
moods
has
become
more
marked
then
when
that
letter
came
he
seemed
to
give
himself
wholly
up
to
whatever
it
is
which
has
obsessed
him
emily
will
you
let
me
see
the
letter
again
morrow
asked
suddenly
if
you
really
care
for
me
and
will
be
my
wife
some
day
your
troubles
and
vexations
are
mine
i
want
you
to
let
me
take
the
letter
home
with
me
i
feel
that
if
i
can
study
it
for
a
few
hours
undisturbed
i
shall
be
able
to
read
the
cipher
i
promise
dear
to
bring
it
back
the
very
first
thing
in
the
morning
of
course
you
may
have
it
guy
the
young
girl
rose
impulsively
and
went
to
the
little
desk
in
the
corner
i
hid
it
last
night
after
you
had
gone
among
some
old
receipts
here
it
is
you
need
not
return
it
keep
it
for
several
days
if
you
like
until
you
have
studied
it
thoroughly
i
do
see
how
you
or
any
one
could
solve
it
without
possessing
the
key
but
i
should
feel
as
if
a
load
were
taken
off
my
shoulders
if
you
will
try
she
gave
him
the
letter
and
after
a
long
tender
farewell
he
took
his
departure
going
straight
to
his
room
at
quinlan
he
lighted
the
lamp
so
that
if
emily
chanced
to
look
over
the
way
she
would
fancy
him
at
work
upon
the
cryptogram
morrow
waited
until
the
little
house
opposite
was
plunged
in
darkness
then
very
stealthily
he
crept
down
the
stairs
and
let
himself
out
the
precious
letter
carefully
tucked
into
an
inside
pocket
morrow
proceeded
at
once
to
blaine
office
and
found
his
chief
awaiting
him
here
the
letter
sir
he
announced
as
he
placed
the
single
sheet
of
paper
on
the
desk
before
the
detective
i
ca
make
anything
out
of
it
but
you
probably
will
it
curious
is
it
why
for
instance
are
those
little
dots
placed
near
some
of
the
crazy
figures
and
not
others
blaine
picked
the
letter
up
and
examined
it
with
eager
interest
it
comparatively
simple
he
remarked
as
he
spread
it
flat
upon
the
desk
and
taking
up
pen
and
paper
copied
it
rapidly
symbolic
cryptograms
are
usually
decipherable
with
the
expenditure
of
a
little
time
and
effort
there
is
a
method
which
is
universally
followed
and
has
been
for
ages
for
instance
the
letter
is
recognized
as
being
the
most
frequently
used
in
ordinary
english
of
the
whole
alphabet
after
that
the
vowels
and
consonants
in
an
accepted
rotation
which
i
will
not
take
up
our
valuable
time
in
discussing
with
you
now
since
we
will
not
even
need
to
use
it
in
this
here
take
this
copy
and
see
if
you
can
follow
me
he
passed
the
sheet
of
paper
across
to
his
operative
and
morrow
gazed
again
upon
the
curiously
shaped
characters
which
from
close
scrutiny
had
become
familiar
yet
still
remained
maddeningly
baffling
to
him
illustration
an
image
of
a
coded
message
is
shown
here
in
the
text
now
resumed
blaine
presupposing
that
in
an
ostensibly
friendly
message
beginning
with
a
word
of
four
letters
that
word
is
and
we
two
important
vowels
to
start
with
we
know
the
letter
was
addressed
to
brunell
from
an
old
partner
in
crime
we
will
assume
therefore
that
the
two
words
of
three
letters
each
following
are
either
or
let
us
see
how
it
works
out
the
detective
scribbled
hastily
on
a
pad
for
several
minutes
then
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
it
can
only
be
he
announced
that
gives
us
a
working
start
of
eight
letters
add
to
that
the
fact
that
this
character
is
printed
twice
consecutively
in
three
different
places
he
pointed
to
the
figure
as
he
spoke
which
confirms
the
supposition
that
it
is
and
you
have
this
result
immediately
blaine
handed
the
pad
across
to
morrow
who
read
eagerly
old
old
ore
le
are
yo
o
r
ll
the
operative
started
to
speak
but
checked
himself
and
listened
while
henry
blaine
went
on
slowly
but
steadily
each
letter
gained
helps
us
to
others
you
see
guy
for
instance
must
be
the
character
following
three
times
in
different
places
must
be
the
word
can
only
be
is
is
and
is
that
gives
us
eight
more
letters
and
makes
the
message
read
like
this
blaine
wrote
it
down
and
handed
the
result
to
morrow
who
read
old
money
to
you
from
old
score
left
my
share
for
for
you
no
ll
call
on
you
thursday
at
four
it
looks
easy
now
admitted
morrow
but
i
never
should
have
thought
of
going
about
it
that
way
i
suppose
the
sixth
word
is
that
gives
us
and
right
you
are
blaine
chuckled
knowing
too
that
the
message
came
from
walter
pennold
we
can
safely
assume
that
is
use
your
common
sense
alone
now
and
you
will
find
that
the
message
reads
old
boy
big
money
coming
to
you
from
old
score
left
unpaid
what
is
my
share
for
collecting
for
you
no
risk
will
call
on
you
thursday
at
four
pen
the
word
was
misspelled
evidently
pennold
was
a
little
bit
rusty
in
the
use
of
the
old
code
our
bait
landed
the
fish
all
right
guy
the
money
we
planted
in
the
bank
of
brooklyn
and
queens
certainly
brought
results
no
wonder
poor
old
jimmy
brunell
was
all
broken
up
when
he
received
such
a
message
more
crafty
than
pennold
he
realized
that
it
was
a
trap
and
we
were
on
his
trail
at
last
we
got
him
cinched
now
but
he
only
a
tool
possibly
a
helpless
one
in
the
hands
of
the
master
workmen
we
go
after
them
tooth
and
nail
for
the
happiness
and
stainless
name
of
two
innocent
young
girls
who
trust
in
us
and
we
get
them
guy
we
get
them
if
there
is
any
justice
and
honor
and
truth
left
in
the
world
chapter
xiii
the
empty
house
do
spare
them
now
get
the
truth
at
all
costs
with
the
last
instructions
of
his
chief
ringing
in
his
ears
the
following
morning
guy
morrow
set
out
for
brooklyn
to
interview
his
erstwhile
friends
the
pennolds
in
his
true
colors
mame
pennold
who
was
cleaning
the
dingy
front
room
heard
the
click
of
the
gate
and
peered
with
habitual
caution
from
behind
the
frayed
curtains
of
the
window
the
unexpected
reappearance
of
their
young
banking
acquaintance
sent
her
scurrying
as
fast
as
her
palsied
legs
could
carry
her
back
to
the
kitchen
where
her
husband
sat
luxuriously
smoking
and
toasting
his
feet
at
the
roaring
little
stove
wally
who
think
comin
up
the
walk
that
young
feller
alfred
hicks
who
skipped
from
the
brooklyn
and
queens
bank
good
lord
walter
pennold
took
his
pipe
from
his
lips
and
stared
at
her
what
brought
him
back
think
he
broke
an
wants
a
touch
his
wife
responded
somewhat
doubtfully
he
looked
prosperous
all
right
by
the
flash
i
got
at
him
an
he
real
brisk
and
businesslike
maybe
he
back
on
the
job
likely
not
after
the
way
he
left
his
boarding
place
if
that
lindsay
woman
did
lie
pennold
laid
aside
his
pipe
and
frowned
thoughtfully
as
steps
echoed
from
the
rickety
porch
and
a
knock
sounded
upon
the
door
he
a
lightweight
every
way
you
take
him
he
never
stick
anywhere
maybe
he
come
to
try
an
get
you
into
somethin
mame
suggested
do
you
go
takin
up
with
a
bad
penny
at
your
time
o
life
wally
he
might
know
somethin
an
try
blackmail
if
he
real
up
against
it
well
go
ahead
an
open
the
door
ordered
walter
impatiently
straight
with
the
bank
if
he
workin
there
again
we
ai
got
nothin
to
worry
about
an
if
he
ai
we
got
nothin
against
him
let
him
in
with
obvious
reluctance
mame
shuffled
through
the
hall
and
obeyed
hello
mrs
pennold
guy
greeted
her
heartily
but
without
offering
his
hand
he
brushed
past
her
figure
with
scant
ceremony
and
entered
the
kitchen
hello
pennold
thought
i
might
find
you
home
this
cold
morning
how
goes
it
same
as
usual
pennold
rose
slowly
and
looked
at
his
visitor
with
swiftly
narrowed
eyes
there
was
a
new
note
in
the
young
man
voice
which
the
other
vaguely
recognized
it
was
as
if
a
lantern
had
suddenly
flashed
into
his
face
from
the
darkness
or
an
authoritative
hand
been
laid
upon
his
shoulder
he
motioned
mechanically
toward
a
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
stove
and
added
slowly
to
see
you
al
did
expect
you
be
around
here
again
after
your
workin
once
more
oh
i
right
on
the
job
responded
guy
briskly
he
drew
the
chair
close
to
the
square
deal
table
so
close
that
he
could
have
reached
out
had
he
pleased
and
touched
his
host
sleeve
pennold
seated
himself
again
in
his
old
position
significantly
so
that
when
he
glanced
slyly
at
his
visitor
it
was
over
his
shoulder
in
the
furtive
fashion
of
one
on
guard
ai
back
with
the
brooklyn
and
queens
are
you
he
asked
no
it
got
too
slow
for
me
there
i
found
something
bigger
to
do
mame
pennold
who
had
been
hovering
in
the
background
came
forward
now
and
faced
him
across
the
table
her
shrewd
eyes
fastened
upon
him
must
have
easy
hours
when
you
can
get
off
in
the
morning
like
this
she
observed
did
forget
your
old
friends
did
you
no
of
course
not
i
had
anything
more
important
to
do
this
morning
so
i
thought
i
drop
in
and
see
you
both
his
hand
traveled
to
his
breast
pocket
and
at
the
gesture
gaunt
body
stiffened
suddenly
did
come
to
inquire
about
our
health
did
you
she
shot
at
him
acrimoniously
i
came
to
see
you
about
another
matter
not
on
the
trail
of
old
jimmy
brunell
still
on
that
business
of
the
bonds
found
at
the
bank
walter
voice
was
suddenly
shrill
with
simulated
mirth
nothin
in
that
for
you
al
not
a
nickel
if
what
you
here
for
i
not
on
brunell
trail
i
found
him
morrow
returned
quietly
and
in
the
tense
pause
which
ensued
he
added
dryly
you
led
me
to
him
so
that
what
it
was
a
plant
walter
started
from
his
chair
but
mame
laid
a
trembling
sinewy
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
forced
him
back
what
mean
young
man
she
demanded
what
do
we
know
about
old
brunell
you
wrote
him
a
letter
you
knew
where
to
find
him
i
only
wish

she
ejaculated
we
did
write
him

to
you
from
old
score

unpaid
what
is
my
share

quoted
morrow
adding
i

a
friend
who
is
very
much
interested
in

he
wanted
me
to
ask
you

pennold
his

blaine
mame

shrank
to
a
mere
whisper
and
her
sallow
face
whitened
blaine
henry
blaine
the
guy
they
call
the
master
mind
shaking
voice
rose
to
a
breaking
cry
but
again
his
wife
silenced
him

a
letter

through
the
third
degree
beat
it
now
he
rose
blusteringly
and
advanced
toward
morrow
with
upraised
fist
but
the
other
with
the
table
between
them
drew
from
his
pocket
a
folded
paper
not
so
fast
pennold
i

a
warrant
here

before
he
opened
the
paper
and
spread
it
out
for
them
to
read
walter

perry

scribbler

the
rogues
gallery
first
term

joliet
for

second
at

sing
for
shoving
the
queer
this
warrant
only
holds
you
as
a
suspicious
character
pennold
but
we
can
dig
up
plenty
of
other
things
if
it
necessary
there
a
forger
named
griswold
in
the
tombs
now
awaiting
trial
who
will
snitch
about
that
rochester
check
for
one
thing
do
let
him
bluff
you
wally
mame
faced

from
her
side
they

up
a
thing
that

time

clean
seven
years
an
you
free
from
the
bulls
they
ca
hold
you
i
have
any
warrant
yet
for
you
pennold
observed
morrow
imperturbably
i
admit
that
it
more
than
seven
years
since
every
detective
was
on
the
for
mame
i
believe
you
specialized
in
furs
and
laces
did
you
what
it
to
you
you
ca
lay
a
finger
on
me
now
the
woman
stormed
defiantly
not
for
or
forgery
but
how
about
receiving
stolen
goods
the
shot
found
an
instant
target
walter
pennold
slumped
and
crumpled
down
into
his
chair
his
arms
outspread
upon
the
table
he
laid
his
head
upon
them
and
a
single
dry
shuddering
sob
tore
its
way
from
his
throat
the
woman
backed
slowly
away
and
for
the
first
time
a
shadow
as
of
approaching
terror
crossed
her
hard
challenging
face
stolen
goods
she
repeated
what
are
you
tryin
to
put
over
do
you
think
we
so
green
at
the
game
that
you
can
plant
the
goods
here
an
get
us
put
away
on
the
strength
of
a
past
record
you
a
nothing
like
it
morrow
leaned
forward
impressively
we
do
have
to
do
any
planting
mame
it
a
good
deal
less
than
seven
years
since
the
mortimer
chase
silver
plate
lay
in
your
cellar
silver
plate
in
our
cellar
echoed
mame
in
genuine
amazement
she
stepped
forward
again
her
shrewish
chin
but
walter
pennold
raised
his
face
and
at
sight
of
it
she
stopped
as
if
turned
to
stone
it
no
use
he
cried
brokenly
they
got
me
mame
got
you
they
never
get
you
her
startled
scream
rang
out
wally
know
what
the
next
term
means
it
a
lifer
on
any
count
i
do
know
what
he
means
about
any
silver
plate
but
it
a
bluff
do
let
him
get
your
nerve
is
it
a
bluff
pennold
asked
morrow
with
dominant
insistence
the
broken
figure
huddled
in
the
chair
shuddered
uncontrollably
no
it
ai
he
muttered
i
i
held
out
on
you
mame
i
knew
you
would
risk
it
so
i
did
say
nothin
to
you
about
it
but
the
money
was
too
easy
to
let
get
by
the
old
gang
offered
me
five
hundred
bucks
just
to
keep
it
ten
days
and
pass
it
on
to
jennings
he
came
here
with
a
cart
you
remember
you
wondered
what
i
was
givin
him
an
i
told
you
it
was
some
rolls
of
old
carpet
i
got
from
that
place
i
was
night
watchman
at
in
vandewater
street
i
hid
the
stuff
under
the
coal
shut
up
cried
mame
fiercely
you
do
know
what
you
sayin
wally
hold
your
tongue
for
god
sake
where
your
spirit
are
you
goin
to
break
down
now
like
a
reformatory
brat
you
that
had
all
guessin
for
twenty
years
the
gaunt
woman
had
recovered
from
the
sudden
shock
of
her
unexpected
revelation
and
now
towered
protectingly
over
his
collapsed
form
her
palsied
hands
for
once
steady
and
firm
upon
his
shoulders
while
her
keen
eyes
glittered
shrewdly
at
the
young
operative
confronting
them
look
here
she
said
shortly
if
you
wanted
us
for
receiving
stolen
goods
you
would
come
around
here
with
a
warrant
for
wally
arrest
as
a
suspicious
character
an
you
would
have
worked
that
brunell
plant
what
your
lay
information
responded
morrow
frankly
the
police
do
know
where
the
plate
was
for
those
ten
days
and
there
no
immediate
need
that
they
should
blaine
cleaned
up
that
case
eventually
you
know
recovered
the
plate
and
caught
the
butler
in
southampton
under
the
noses
of
the
scotland
yard
men
i
want
to
know
what
you
can
tell
me
about
brunell
and
about
your
nephew
charley
pennold
walter
opened
his
lips
but
closed
them
without
speech
and
his
wife
replied
for
him
we
no
snitchers
she
said
coldly
there
nothin
we
can
tell
jimmy
brunell
run
straight
for
near
twenty
years
so
far
as
we
know
and
charley
persisted
morrow
it
no
use
mame
walter
pennold
repeated
dully
if
i
go
up
again
it
means
the
end
for
me
charley
got
to
take
his
chance
same
as
the
rest
of
us
god
knows
i
tried
to
do
the
right
thing
by
the
boy
same
as
jimmy
did
by
his
daughter
but
charley
got
the
blood
in
him
it
hell
to
peach
on
your
own
but
it
worse
to
hear
that
iron
door
clank
behind
you
and
to
know
it
for
the
last
time
after
all
there
ai
nothin
in
what
we
can
tell
about
charley
that
a
lot
of
other
people
would
spill
an
nothin
that
could
land
him
behind
the
bars
i
ai
the
man
i
was
or
i
take
my
medicine
without
squealin
but
i
ca
face
it
again
mame
i
ca
i
an
old
man
now
old
before
my
time
perhaps
but
it
been
so
long
since
i
smelled
the
prison
taint
so
long
since
i
had
a
number
instead
of
a
name
that
i
die
now
quick
before
i
rot
in
a
cell
the
terrible
droning
monotone
ceased
and
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
in
the
squalid
little
room
the
woman
face
was
as
impassive
as
morrow
as
she
waited
only
the
tightening
of
her
hands
upon
her
husband
shoulders
until
her
bony
knuckles
showed
white
through
the
drawn
skin
betrayed
the
storm
of
emotion
which
swept
over
her
at
the
memories
evoked
by
the
broken
words
i
not
asking
you
to
snitch
pennold
morrow
said
not
unkindly
we
know
all
we
want
to
about
brunell
life
at
present
his
home
in
the
bronx
and
his
little
shop
and
we
not
trying
to
rake
up
anything
from
the
past
to
hold
over
him
now
it
is
only
some
general
information
i
want
as
to
your
nephew
you
got
to
tell
me
all
you
know
about
him
or
it
all
up
with
you
blaine
wo
give
you
away
if
you
answer
my
questions
frankly
and
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
this
is
your
only
chance
pennold
licked
his
dry
lips
what
do
you
want
to
know
he
asked
at
last
when
did
jimmy
brunell
turn
his
last
trick
years
ago
i
forgotten
how
many
it
no
harm
speakin
of
it
now
for
he
did
his
seven
years
up
the
river
for
it
his
first
and
only
conviction
that
was
the
time
old
cowperthwaite
name
was
forged
to
five
checks
amounting
to
thirty
thousand
all
told
and
jimmy
was
caught
on
the
last
where
was
his
plant
in
a
basement
on
dye
street
the
bulls
never
found
it
he
was
running
a
little
printer
shop
in
front
as
a
blind
oh
he
was
clever
old
jimmy
the
sharpest
in
his
line
what
became
of
his
outfit
when
he
was
sent
up
dunno
it
just
disappeared
some
of
his
old
pals
cribbed
it
i
guess
or
jimmy
may
have
fixed
it
with
them
to
remove
it
he
was
always
and
he
never
would
tell
me
i
knew
where
his
plant
was
of
course
and
i
went
there
myself
after
he
was
sent
up
and
the
coast
was
clear
to
get
the
outfit
to
to
take
care
of
it
for
him
until
he
came
out
oh
i
ai
afraid
to
tell
now
it
so
long
ago
i
could
take
you
to
the
place
but
the
outfit
gone
and
when
he
had
served
his
term
what
happened
he
came
out
to
find
that
his
wife
was
dead
and
emily
the
little
girl
that
was
born
just
after
he
went
up
was
none
too
well
treated
by
the
people
her
mother
had
to
leave
her
with
he
learned
in
the
pen
to
make
maps
an
he
opened
a
little
shop
an
made
up
his
mind
to
live
straight
an
an
so
far
as
i
know
he
has
pennold
faltered
as
if
from
weakness
and
for
a
moment
his
voice
ceased
then
he
went
on
i
ai
seen
him
for
a
long
time
but
we
kept
track
of
each
other
an
when
you
come
with
that
story
about
the
bonds
and
the
bank
backed
you
up
in
it
why
i
i
went
to
see
him
you
wrote
him
first
why
did
you
send
a
cipher
letter
because
i
suspicioned
the
whole
thing
was
a
plant
just
like
it
turned
out
to
be
an
i
did
want
to
get
an
old
pal
into
no
trouble
the
cipher
an
old
one
we
used
years
ago
in
the
gang
an
i
know
he
would
forget
it
i
never
thought
he
squeal
on
me
to
blaine
he
did
the
letter
er
came
into
blaine
possession
and
he
read
it
for
himself
he
did
pennold
looked
up
quickly
with
a
flash
of
interest
on
his
sullen
face
he
a
wonder
that
blaine
if
he
only
got
started
the
other
way
the
way
we
did
what
a
crook
he
would
have
made
as
it
is
i
guess
we
ai
afraid
of
all
the
organized
police
on
earth
combined
as
much
as
we
are
of
him
it
a
queer
thing
he
ai
been
shot
up
or
blown
into
eternity
long
ago
an
yet
they
say
he
never
guarded
he
must
be
a
cool
one
anyhow
i
glad
jimmy
did
squeal
on
me
hate
to
think
it
of
him
when
i
went
to
see
him
about
the
bonds
he
would
have
nothin
to
do
with
them
swore
they
was
a
plant
he
did
an
warned
me
off
he
seemed
real
excited
considerin
he
had
to
worry
about
but
i
took
his
word
for
it
an
beat
it
that
the
last
i
seen
of
him
did
you
send
your
nephew
to
him
me
pennold
tones
quickened
in
surprise
i
ai
seen
him
in
a
long
while
an
i
do
believe
he
even
remembers
old
jimmy
he
was
only
a
kid
when
jimmy
went
up
the
river
what
would
i
send
charley
for
when
i
gone
myself
an
it
had
worked
it
was
evident
to
morrow
that
the
man
he
was
interrogating
was
ignorant
of
brunell
connection
with
the
lawton
case
and
he
changed
his
tactics
tell
me
about
charley
you
say
you
tried
to
do
right
by
him
of
course
i
did
was
he
my
brother
boy
pennold
hunched
over
the
table
and
continued
eagerly
mame
kept
him
clean
an
fed
an
we
sent
him
to
public
school
just
like
any
other
kid
but
it
was
no
use
he
had
it
in
him
to
go
wrong
without
the
wit
to
get
away
with
it
he
was
caught
pinchin
lead
piping
when
he
was
sixteen
an
sent
to
elmira
for
three
years
them
three
years
was
his
finish
when
he
came
out
he
had
what
you
call
a
graduate
course
in
every
form
of
crookedness
under
the
sun
from
fellers
harder
an
cleverer
than
ever
thought
of
bein
an
he
was
bitter
besides
an
desperate
there
was
no
chance
for
him
then
an
he
just
drifted
on
down
the
line
i
never
heard
of
him
turnin
a
real
trick
himself
an
he
never
got
caught
at
nothin
again
but
he
chummed
in
with
the
gang
an
he
always
seemed
to
have
coin
enough
i
ai
seen
him
in
a
year
the
last
i
heard
of
him
he
was
workin
as
a
an
snitcher
for
the
worst
scoundrel
of
the
lot
who
was
that
asked
morrow
pennold
hesitated
and
then
replied
with
dogged
reluctance
i
dunno
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
but
the
feller
name
is
paddington
an
he
the
worst
kind
of
a
crook
a
gone
wrong
at
least
that
what
they
say
about
him
but
i
ai
got
nothin
on
him
i
do
believe
i
ever
seen
the
man
that
i
know
of
he
worked
on
a
lot
of
shady
cases
i
know
that
much
an
he
clever
a
dozen
crooks
are
floatin
around
town
that
would
be
up
the
river
if
he
told
what
he
knew
about
so
naturally
he
owns
body
an
soul
not
that
charley
one
that
go
up
he
only
in
it
for
the
coin
but
rather
see
him
get
pinched
an
do
time
for
pullin
off
somethin
on
his
own
account
than
runnin
around
doin
dirty
work
for
a
man
who
ai
in
his
father
class
or
mine
he
a
disgrace
that
what
charley
is
a
plain
disgrace
pennold
voice
rang
out
in
highly
virtuous
indignation
morrow
forbore
to
smile
at
the
oblique
moral
viewpoint
of
the
old
crook
what
does
he
look
like
he
asked
short
and
slim
is
he
with
a
small
dark
mustache
that
him
ejaculated
pennold
disgustedly
dresses
like
a
dude
an
chases
after
a
bunch
of
skirts
spreads
himself
like
a
ward
politician
when
he
gets
a
chance
he
my
nephew
all
right
but
as
long
as
he
wo
run
straight
same
as
i
doin
now
i
rather
crack
a
crib
than
play
errand
boy
for
a
man
i
would
trust
on
where
does
charley
live
asked
morrow
how
should
i
know
he
hangs
out
at
lafferty
saloon
down
on
sand
street
when
he
ai
off
on
some
steer
or
other
leastways
he
used
to
morrow
folded
the
warrant
slowly
in
the
pause
which
ensued
and
returned
it
to
his
pocket
while
the
couple
watched
him
tensely
all
right
pennold
he
said
at
last
i
guess
i
wo
have
to
use
this
now
if
you
been
square
an
told
me
all
you
know
you
be
bothered
about
that
matter
of
the
mortimer
chase
silver
plate
if
you
kept
anything
back
blaine
will
find
it
out
and
then
to
you
i
ai
returned
pennold
with
tremendous
eagerness
i
told
you
everything
you
asked
an
i
do
savvy
what
you
gettin
at
anyway
if
you
tryin
to
mix
jimmy
brunell
up
in
any
new
case
you
dead
wrong
he
out
of
the
game
for
good
as
for
charley
he
would
know
enough
to
pick
up
a
if
he
saw
one
lyin
on
the
sidewalk
unless
he
was
told
to
well
i
may
as
well
warn
both
of
you
that
you
watched
and
if
you
try
to
make
a
you
be
taken
up
and
it
wo
be
on
suspicion
either
play
fair
with
blaine
and
he
be
square
with
you
but
do
try
to
put
anything
over
on
him
or
it
be
the
worse
for
you
it
ca
be
done
morrow
closed
the
door
behind
him
leaving
the
couple
as
they
had
been
almost
throughout
the
interview
the
woman
erect
and
stony
of
face
the
man
miserable
and
shaken
crouched
dejectedly
over
the
table
but
scarcely
had
he
descended
the
steps
of
the
ramshackle
little
porch
when
the
voice
of
mame
pennold
reached
him
pitched
in
a
shrill
key
of
emotional
exultation
oh
wally
wally
thank
god
you
ai
a
snitcher
thank
god
you
did
tell
the
voice
ceased
suddenly
as
if
a
hand
had
been
laid
across
her
lips
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
morrow
swung
off
down
the
path
conscious
of
at
least
one
pair
of
eyes
watching
him
from
behind
the
soiled
curtains
of
the
front
room
what
had
the
woman
meant
pennold
obviously
had
kept
something
back
but
was
it
of
sufficient
importance
to
warrant
his
returning
and
forcing
a
confession
whether
it
concerned
brunell
or
their
nephew
charley
mattered
little
at
the
moment
he
had
achieved
the
object
of
his
visit
he
knew
that
pennold
himself
had
no
connection
with
the
lawton
forgeries
nor
knowledge
of
them
and
at
the
same
time
he
had
learned
of
charley
affiliation
with
paddington
the
couple
back
there
in
the
little
house
could
tell
him
scarcely
more
which
would
aid
him
in
his
investigation
but
the
dapper
viciously
weak
young
if
he
could
be
located
at
once
might
be
made
to
disclose
enough
to
place
paddington
definitely
within
the
grasp
of
the
law
guy
morrow
boarded
a
sand
street
car
and
behind
the
sporting
page
of
a
newspaper
he
kept
a
sharp
for
lafferty
saloon
he
came
to
it
at
last
a
dingy
resort
with
much
faded
over
the
door
and
posters
of
the
latest
social
function
of
the
district
political
club
showing
dimly
behind
its
unwashed
windows
he
rode
a
block
beyond
then
alighting
turned
back
and
entered
the
bar
it
was
deserted
at
that
hour
of
the
morning
save
for
a
individual
who
leaned
upon
one
ragged
elbow
gazing
mournfully
into
his
empty
whisky
glass
at
the
end
of
the
narrow
varnished
counter
the
bartender
emerged
from
a
door
leading
into
the
back
room
with
a
tall
empty
glass
in
his
hand
and
morrow
asked
for
a
beer
as
he
stood
sipping
it
he
watched
the
bartender
replenish
the
empty
unwashed
glass
he
had
carried
with
a
generous
drink
of
doubtful
looking
absinthe
and
a
squirt
from
a
syphon
bum
drink
on
a
cold
morning
he
observed
tentatively
have
a
whisky
straight
on
me
i
will
that
the
bartender
returned
heartily
this
fairy
stuff
ai
for
me
it
for
a
dame
in
the
back
room
one
of
the
regulars
she
been
hittin
it
up
all
the
morning
but
it
do
seem
to
affect
her
funny
too
for
she
ai
a
boozer
as
a
general
thing
her
guy
gone
back
on
her
an
she
sore
i
be
with
you
in
a
minute
he
vanished
into
the
back
room
with
the
glass
and
before
he
returned
the
disconsolate
individual
had
slunk
out
leaving
morrow
in
sole
possession
if
this
place
was
indeed
the
rendezvous
of
the
gang
of
minor
criminals
with
which
charley
pennold
had
allied
himself
he
had
obviously
come
at
the
wrong
time
to
obtain
any
information
concerning
him
unless
the
voluble
bartender
could
be
made
to
talk
and
that
would
be
a
difficult
matter
look
here
morrow
decided
on
a
bold
move
as
the
bartender
reappeared
and
placed
a
bottle
of
whisky
between
them
he
leaned
forward
after
a
quick
furtive
glance
about
him
and
spoke
rapidly
with
a
disarming
air
of
confidential
frankness
i
in
an
awful
hole
i
new
at
this
game
and
i
got
to
find
a
fellow
i
never
saw
and
find
him
quick
he
hangs
out
here
and
the
big
guy
sent
me
for
him
what
big
guy
the
cordiality
faded
from
the
bartender
ruddy
countenance
and
he
stepped
back
significantly
you
know
pad
morrow
shot
back
on
a
desperate
bluff
the
name
charley
pennold
and
pad
wants
him
right
away
he
did
tell
me
to
ask
you
about
him
but
he
made
it
pretty
plain
to
me
that
got
to
get
him
say
the
bartender
approached
cautiously
he
rested
one
hand
upon
the
counter
keeping
the
other
well
below
it
but
morrow
did
not
flinch
what
your
lay
anything
there
coin
in
returned
the
operative
with
a
knowing
leer
anything
from
planting
divorce
evidence
to
shoving
the
queer
i
been
working
for
a
pal
of
pad
in
louis
for
three
or
four
years
that
why
i
strange
around
here
pad
up
in
the
air
about
something
and
wants
this
right
away
and
he
tells
me
to
look
here
for
him
and
not
come
back
without
him
see
this
is
on
the
level
if
you
know
where
he
is
be
a
good
fellow
and
come
across
will
you
the
bartender
felt
under
the
counter
for
the
shelf
and
then
raised
his
hand
empty
toward
the
bottle
i
guess
you
all
right
he
remarked
anyway
i
take
a
chance
what
your
moniker
guy
the
blinker
returned
morrow
promptly
guess
you
heard
of
me
all
right
i
pulled
off
but
i
have
got
time
to
chin
now
i
got
to
find
this
boy
if
i
want
to
keep
in
with
pad
and
there
coin
in
it
sure
there
is
the
bartender
affirmed
but
he
a
queer
one
the
big
guy
as
you
call
him
what
his
game
why
only
this
morning
he
tipped
charley
off
to
beat
it
and
charley
did
maybe
he
thinks
the
kid
him
morrow
heart
leaped
in
sudden
excitement
at
this
astounding
news
but
he
controlled
himself
and
replied
nonchalantly
search
me
he
told
me
i
find
this
here
that
all
i
know
he
is
talking
for
publication
not
pad
you
bet
not
the
bartender
nodded
then
he
jerked
a
grimy
thumb
in
the
direction
of
the
back
room
why
the
dame
in
there
cryin
into
her
absinthe
is
charley
girl
she
a
queen
straight
as
they
make
if
she
does
work
the
shops
now
and
then
and
charley
was
to
hook
up
with
her
next
month
and
settle
down
now
he
gets
the
office
and
skips
without
a
word
to
her
and
she
all
broke
up
over
it
the
door
at
the
rear
opened
suddenly
and
a
girl
stood
upon
the
threshold
she
was
tall
and
slender
and
her
face
showed
traces
of
positive
beauty
although
it
was
bloated
and
distorted
with
weeping
and
dissipation
and
her
big
black
eyes
glittered
feverishly
what
that
you
sayin
about
charley
she
demanded
he
gone
he
left
me
i
do
believe
pad
gave
him
the
office
and
if
he
did
charley
a
fool
to
beat
it
they
got
nothin
on
him
pad
who
got
to
save
his
own
skin
shut
up
annie
advised
the
bartender
not
unkindly
pad
sent
this
here
feller
for
him
now
then
it
was
a
lie
a
lie
pad
did
tell
him
to
beat
it
he
gone
on
his
own
account
gone
for
good
but
i
find
him
i
the
girl
suddenly
burst
into
a
storm
of
sobs
and
turning
reeled
back
into
the
inner
room
you
see
the
bartender
observed
confidentially
as
the
door
swung
shut
behind
her
she
thinks
he
gone
off
with
another
skirt
the
way
with
women
i
knew
pad
had
given
him
the
office
though
i
got
it
straight
you
right
about
pad
bein
up
in
the
air
he
must
have
bitten
off
more
than
he
can
chew
this
time
i
heard
reddy
thursby
talkin
to
gil
hennessey
about
it
right
where
you
standin
not
two
hours
ago
they
both
pad
men
met
yet
morrow
shook
his
head
not
trusting
himself
to
speak
and
the
loquacious
bartender
went
on
it
was
reddy
brought
the
word
for
charley
to
skip
and
he
dropped
somethin
about
a
raid
on
some
plant
up
in
the
bronx
know
anything
about
it
for
a
moment
the
rows
of
bottles
on
their
shelves
seemed
to
reel
before
morrow
eyes
and
his
heart
stood
still
but
he
forced
himself
to
reply
oh
that
i
know
all
about
it
of
course
was
i
in
on
the
ground
floor
but
that
only
a
fake
steer
this
has
got
anything
to
do
with
it
that
i
know
of
maybe
the
big
guy
thought
he
had
got
out
of
the
way
and
sent
me
to
find
out
no
use
my
hanging
round
here
any
longer
anyhow
i
amble
back
and
tell
pad
he
gone
swell
dame
that
annie
some
queen
eh
let
have
one
more
drink
and
i
blow
with
assurances
of
an
early
return
morrow
contrived
to
beat
a
retreat
without
arousing
the
suspicions
of
the
bartender
but
he
went
out
into
the
pale
wintry
sunlight
with
his
brain
awhirl
to
his
apprehensive
mind
a
raid
on
a
plant
in
the
bronx
could
mean
only
one
place
the
little
shop
of
jimmy
brunell
something
had
happened
in
his
absence
some
one
had
betrayed
the
old
forger
and
emily
what
of
her
morrow
sped
as
fast
as
elevated
and
subway
could
carry
him
to
the
bronx
anxious
as
he
was
about
the
girl
he
loved
he
did
not
go
directly
to
the
house
on
meadow
lane
but
made
a
detour
to
the
little
shop
a
few
blocks
away
morrow
instinct
had
not
misled
him
before
he
had
approached
within
a
hundred
feet
of
the
shop
he
knew
that
his
fears
had
been
justified
the
door
swung
idly
open
on
its
hinges
and
the
single
window
gave
forth
a
vacant
stare
within
everything
was
in
the
wildest
disorder
the
table
which
served
as
a
counter
the
racks
of
maps
the
high
stool
the
printing
apparatus
all
were
overturned
the
trap
door
leading
into
the
cellar
was
open
and
morrow
flung
himself
wildly
down
the
sanded
steps
the
forger
outfit
had
disappeared
what
had
become
of
jimmy
brunell
his
purpose
served
had
paddington
betrayed
him
to
the
police
or
had
some
warning
reached
him
to
flee
before
it
was
too
late
with
mingled
emotions
of
fear
and
dread
morrow
emerged
from
the
little
dismantled
shop
and
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
meadow
lane
the
brunell
cottage
appeared
much
as
usual
as
he
neared
it
and
for
an
instant
hope
surged
up
within
him
emily
would
be
at
the
club
of
course
if
her
father
had
been
arrested
or
had
succeeded
in
getting
away
safely
alone
she
would
not
know
of
it
until
she
came
back
in
the
evening
he
would
wait
for
her
intercept
her
and
tell
her
the
whole
truth
instead
of
entering
his
own
lodgings
he
crossed
the
road
and
paused
at
the
brunells
gate
something
forlorn
and
desolate
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
little
home
seemed
to
clutch
at
his
heart
and
on
a
swift
impulse
he
strode
up
the
path
ascended
the
steps
of
the
porch
and
peered
in
the
window
of
the
everything
in
the
usually
orderly
room
was
and
everywhere
there
was
evidence
of
hurried
flight
from
where
he
stood
the
desk
her
desk
was
plainly
visible
its
ransacked
drawers
pulled
open
the
floor
before
it
strewn
with
torn
and
scattered
papers
its
top
was
bare
amid
the
surrounding
litter
and
even
his
photograph
which
he
had
recently
given
her
and
which
usually
stood
there
in
the
little
frame
she
had
made
for
it
with
her
own
hands
was
gone
a
chill
settled
about
his
heart
had
brunell
been
captured
and
police
detectives
searched
the
house
his
picture
could
hold
no
interest
for
them
had
the
old
forger
fled
alone
he
would
not
have
taken
so
insignificant
an
object
from
among
all
his
household
goods
and
chattels
emily
alone
would
have
paused
to
save
the
photograph
of
the
man
she
loved
from
the
wreckage
of
her
home
emily
too
had
gone
scarcely
knowing
what
he
was
doing
and
caring
less
morrow
rushed
across
the
street
and
descended
upon
quinlan
his
landlady
at
her
post
in
the
kitchen
what
happened
to
the
brunells
he
demanded
breathlessly
land
sakes
but
you
scared
me
mr
morrow
quinlan
turned
from
the
stove
with
a
hurried
start
and
wiped
her
plump
steaming
face
on
her
apron
i
should
like
to
know
what
happened
myself
all
i
do
know
is
that
they
gone
bag
and
baggage
or
as
much
of
it
as
they
could
carry
with
them
and
never
a
word
to
a
soul
except
what
emily
ran
across
to
say
to
me
what
was
it
he
fairly
shouted
at
her
but
there
were
few
interests
in
quinlan
humdrum
existence
and
seldom
did
she
have
an
exciting
incident
to
relate
and
an
eager
audience
to
hang
upon
her
words
she
sat
down
ponderously
and
prepared
to
make
the
most
of
the
present
occasion
i
thought
it
was
funny
to
see
a
man
goin
into
their
yard
at
five
this
mornin
but
my
tooth
was
so
bad
i
forgot
all
about
him
and
it
never
come
into
my
mind
again
until
i
seen
them
goin
away
i
sleep
in
the
room
just
over
yours
you
know
morrow
an
my
tooth
ached
so
bad
i
could
sleep
it
was
five
by
my
clock
when
i
got
up
to
come
down
here
an
get
some
hot
vinegar
an
i
do
know
what
made
me
look
out
my
winder
but
i
did
i
seen
a
man
come
running
down
the
lane
keepin
well
in
the
shaders
an
looking
back
as
if
he
was
afraid
he
was
bein
chased
for
all
the
world
like
a
thief
while
i
looked
he
turned
in
the
brunells
yard
an
instead
of
knocking
on
the
door
he
began
throwin
pebbles
up
at
the
old
man
bedroom
winder
pretty
soon
it
opened
and
brunell
looked
out
then
he
come
down
quick
an
met
the
man
at
the
front
door
they
talked
a
minute
an
the
feller
handed
over
somethin
that
showed
white
in
the
light
of
the
street
lamp
like
a
piece
of
paper
brunell
shut
the
door
an
the
man
ran
off
the
way
he
had
come
i
come
down
an
got
my
hot
vinegar
an
when
i
got
back
to
my
room
i
seen
there
were
lights
in
brunell
room
an
emily
an
one
in
the
too
but
my
tooth
was
jumpin
so
i
went
straight
to
bed
about
half
an
hour
after
you
left
for
business
i
was
shakin
a
rug
out
of
the
front
winder
when
emily
come
runnin
across
the
street
mrs
quinlan

mistaken
i
sorry
to
have
found
him
out
she
burst
out
cryin
again
an
ran
back
as
her
father
called
her
from
the
porch
he
was
bringin
out
a
pile
of
and
and
pretty
soon
a
taxicab
drove
up
with
a
man
inside
i
could
see
his
face
only
his
they
got
in
an
went
off
kitin
an
every
last
thing
i
know
what
she
meant
about
findin
you
out
mr
morrow
he
turned
away
without
reply
and
went
to
his
room
where
he
sat
for
long
sunk
in
a
stupor
of
misery
she
had
found
out
the
truth
before
he
could
tell
her
she
knew
him
for
what
he
was
knew
his
despicable
errand
in
ingratiating
himself
into
her
friendship
and
that
of
her
father
she
believed
that
the
real
love
he
had
professed
for
her
had
been
all
a
mere
part
of
the
game
he
was
playing
and
now
she
had
gone
away
forever
he
would
never
see
her
again
by
god
no
he
cried
aloud
to
himself
in
the
bitterness
of
his
sorrow
i
will
find
her
again
if
i
search
the
ends
of
the
earth
she
shall
know
the
truth
chapter
xiv
in
the
open
guy
morrow
resolve
to
find
emily
brunell
at
all
costs
stirred
him
from
the
apathy
of
despair
into
which
he
had
fallen
and
roused
him
to
instant
action
leaving
the
house
he
went
to
the
nearest
telephone
pay
station
where
he
could
converse
in
comparative
privacy
and
called
up
henry
blaine
office
only
to
discover
that
the
master
detective
had
departed
upon
some
mission
of
his
own
was
not
expected
to
return
until
the
following
morning
and
had
left
no
instructions
for
him
this
unanticipated
left
morrow
without
definite
resource
as
a
forlorn
hope
he
telephoned
to
the
anita
lawton
club
only
to
learn
that
miss
brunell
had
sent
in
her
resignation
as
secretary
early
that
morning
but
told
nothing
of
her
future
plans
except
that
she
was
leaving
town
for
an
indefinite
period
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
learned
by
another
examination
of
the
dismantled
shop
and
the
young
operative
turned
his
steps
reluctantly
homeward
a
sudden
suspicion
had
formed
itself
in
his
mind
that
blaine
himself
and
not
the
police
had
been
responsible
for
the
raid
on
the
forger
little
establishment
that
blaine
had
done
this
without
taking
him
into
his
confidence
and
was
now
purposely
keeping
out
of
his
way
when
the
early
winter
dusk
came
guy
could
endure
it
no
longer
but
left
the
house
drawn
irresistibly
by
his
thoughts
he
crossed
the
road
again
and
entering
the
brunells
gate
he
strolled
around
the
deserted
cottage
to
the
back
at
the
kitchen
door
a
faint
piteous
sound
made
him
pause
it
was
an
insistent
wailing
cry
from
within
the
disconsolate
meowing
of
a
frightened
lonely
kitten
caliban
had
been
left
behind
forgotten
emily
panic
and
haste
must
have
been
great
indeed
to
cause
her
to
forsake
the
pet
she
had
so
tenderly
loved
much
as
he
detested
the
spiteful
little
creature
he
could
not
leave
it
to
starve
for
her
sake
morrow
tried
the
kitchen
door
but
found
it
securely
bolted
from
within
the
catch
on
the
pantry
window
was
loose
however
and
morrow
managed
to
pry
it
open
with
his
jackknife
with
a
hasty
glance
about
to
see
that
he
was
not
observed
he
pushed
up
the
window
and
clambered
in
closing
it
cautiously
after
him
he
stumbled
through
the
and
gloom
into
the
kitchen
instantly
the
piteous
cry
ceased
and
caliban
rose
from
the
cold
hearth
and
bounded
gladly
to
him
purring
and
rubbing
against
his
legs
mechanically
he
stooped
and
stroked
it
then
after
carefully
pulling
down
the
shades
he
lighted
the
lamp
upon
the
littered
table
and
looked
about
him
everything
bore
evidence
as
had
the
of
a
hasty
exodus
the
fire
was
extinguished
in
the
range
and
it
was
filled
to
the
brim
with
flakes
of
light
ashes
evidently
brunell
or
his
daughter
had
paused
long
enough
in
their
flight
to
burn
armfuls
of
old
papers
possibly
incriminating
ones
on
the
table
was
the
débris
of
a
hasty
meal
morrow
poured
some
milk
from
the
pitcher
into
a
saucer
and
placed
it
on
the
floor
for
the
hungry
kitten
then
taking
the
lamp
he
started
on
a
tour
of
inspection
through
the
house
everywhere
the
wildest
confusion
and
disorder
reigned
morrow
turned
aside
from
the
door
of
emily
room
but
entered
her
father
there
save
for
a
few
articles
of
old
clothing
strewn
about
he
found
comparative
order
and
neatness
the
simple
toilet
articles
were
in
their
places
the
narrow
bed
just
as
jimmy
brunell
had
left
it
when
he
sprang
up
to
admit
his
nocturnal
visitor
on
the
floor
near
the
bureau
on
which
the
lamp
stood
something
white
and
crumpled
met
morrow
eye
he
stooped
quickly
and
picked
it
up
it
was
a
large
single
sheet
of
paper
and
as
the
operative
smoothed
it
out
he
realized
that
it
must
be
the
message
which
had
been
hurriedly
brought
to
brunell
in
the
early
hour
before
the
dawn
the
paper
had
lain
just
where
he
had
dropped
it
crushed
from
his
hand
after
reading
the
warning
it
contained
morrow
turned
up
the
wick
of
his
own
lamp
and
stared
curiously
at
the
missive
the
sheet
of
paper
was
ruled
at
intervals
the
lines
and
interstices
filled
with
curious
hieroglyphics
and
at
a
first
glance
it
appeared
to
the
operative
puzzled
eyes
to
be
a
mere
portion
of
a
page
of
music
then
he
observed
that
old
figures
and
letters
totally
foreign
to
the
notes
of
a
printed
score
were
interspersed
between
the
rest
and
moreover
only
the
treble
clef
had
been
used
oh
lord
he
groaned
to
himself
it
another
cryptogram
and
i
do
believe
blaine
himself
will
be
able
to
solve
this
one
he
stared
long
and
uncomprehendingly
at
it
then
with
a
sigh
of
baffled
interest
he
folded
it
carefully
and
placed
it
in
his
pocket
as
he
did
so
there
came
a
sudden
sharp
report
from
outside
the
tinkle
of
a
broken
window
pane
and
a
bullet
whistling
past
his
ear
embedded
itself
in
the
wall
behind
him
instinctively
morrow
flung
himself
flat
upon
the
floor
but
no
second
shot
was
fired
instead
he
heard
the
muffled
receding
of
flying
footsteps
from
the
sidewalk
and
an
excited
cry
or
two
as
neighboring
windows
were
raised
and
curious
heads
were
thrust
out
hastily
extinguishing
the
lamp
morrow
felt
his
way
to
the
kitchen
where
he
pocketed
caliban
with
scant
ceremony
and
departed
swiftly
the
way
he
had
come
through
the
pantry
window
by
scaling
a
wall
or
two
he
found
an
alley
leading
to
the
street
and
making
a
detour
of
several
blocks
he
returned
to
his
lodgings
to
find
quinlan
waiting
in
great
excitement
to
relate
her
version
of
the
revolver
shot
morrow
listened
with
what
patience
he
could
muster
and
then
handed
caliban
over
to
her
mercy
it
miss
brunell
cat
he
explained
you
take
care
of
it
for
a
day
or
two
at
least
wo
you
i
expect
to
hear
from
her
soon
and
i
like
to
be
able
to
restore
it
to
her
well
i
ai
what
you
would
call
crazy
about
cats
the
landlady
returned
somewhat
dubiously
but
i
could
let
it
die
in
this
cold
i
keep
it
of
course
till
you
hear
from
emily
where
did
you
find
it
over
in
their
yard
he
responded
with
prompt
mendacity
i
was
in
the
neighborhood
and
heard
the
shot
fired
so
i
ran
in
to
have
a
look
around
and
see
if
anyone
was
hurt
and
i
came
across
this
poor
little
chap
yowling
on
the
doorstep
i
wo
want
any
supper
quinlan
i
going
out
again
within
the
hour
morrow
presented
himself
at
henry
blaine
office
this
time
he
did
not
wait
to
be
told
that
the
famous
investigator
was
out
but
writing
something
on
a
card
he
sent
it
in
to
the
confidential
secretary
in
a
moment
he
was
admitted
to
find
blaine
seated
imperturbably
behind
his
desk
fingering
the
card
his
young
operative
had
sent
in
to
him
what
is
it
guy
he
asked
not
unkindly
you
say
you
have
a
communication
of
great
importance
i
think
it
is
sir
returned
the
other
stiffly
at
least
i
have
the
message
which
warned
brunell
of
your
raid
upon
his
shop
another
cipher
a
different
one
this
time
indeed
that
good
work
guy
but
how
did
you
know
it
was
a
warning
to
old
jimmy
of
the
raid
could
you
read
it
morrow
shook
his
head
no
and
i
do
see
how
anyone
else
could
it
must
have
been
a
warning
of
some
sort
for
it
was
what
caused
them
both
old
jimmy
and
his
daughter
to
run
away
here
it
is
he
passed
the
cryptogram
over
to
his
chief
who
studied
it
for
a
while
with
a
meditative
frown
then
laid
it
aside
and
listened
in
a
silence
to
his
story
when
the
incidents
of
the
day
had
been
narrated
blaine
said
that
was
a
close
call
guy
that
shot
from
the
darkness
it
must
have
come
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
of
course
from
before
your
own
lodgings
the
bullet
glanced
upward
in
its
course
did
it
no
sir
that
the
funny
part
of
it
the
spot
where
it
is
embedded
in
the
wall
is
very
little
higher
than
the
hole
in
the
window
pane
and
quinlan
where
you
board
is
directly
opposite
yes
it
the
only
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
for
fifty
feet
or
more
on
either
side
then
you
better
look
out
for
trouble
guy
that
shot
came
from
your
own
house
probably
from
the
window
of
your
own
room
if
it
is
the
second
floor
front
as
you
say
there
a
traitor
in
camp
any
new
lodgers
that
you
know
of
no
sir
morrow
replied
startled
at
the
theory
evolved
by
his
chief
but
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
i
distinctly
heard
some
one
running
away
immediately
after
the
shot
was
fired
it
was
probably
a
or
a
decoy
to
draw
investigation
away
from
the
house
had
a
prompt
pursuit
ensued
be
careful
when
you
go
back
guy
and
do
take
any
unnecessary
chances
i
not
going
back
sir
the
younger
man
returned
with
quiet
determination
i
sorry
but
i
through
i
wanted
to
resign
before
to
protect
the
woman
i
love
from
just
this
trouble
which
has
come
upon
her
but
you
overruled
me
and
i
listened
and
played
the
game
fairly
now
i
lost
her
and
nothing
else
matters
under
the
sun
except
that
i
must
find
her
again
and
tell
her
the
truth
and
i
mean
to
find
her
nothing
shall
stand
in
my
way
and
your
duty
asked
blaine
quietly
my
duty
is
to
her
first
last
and
all
the
time
i
know
i
have
no
right
sir
to
ask
that
i
should
be
taken
into
your
confidence
in
regard
to
any
plans
you
make
in
conducting
an
investigation
but
i
think
in
view
of
the
exceptional
conditions
of
this
case
that
i
might
have
been
told
in
advance
of
the
raid
you
intended
so
that
i
might
have
spared
emily
much
of
the
trouble
which
has
come
upon
her
or
at
least
have
told
her
the
truth
and
squared
myself
with
her
and
known
where
she
was
going
i
got
to
find
her
sir
i
can
not
rest
until
i
do
and
you
shall
find
her
guy
i
promise
you
on
my
word
that
if
you
are
patient
all
will
be
well
it
is
not
my
custom
to
explain
my
motives
to
my
subordinates
but
as
you
say
this
case
is
exceptional
and
you
have
been
faithful
to
your
trust
under
peculiarly
trying
circumstances
i
raided
jimmy
little
shop
last
night
and
carried
off
his
forgery
outfit
because
i
had
received
special
information
of
a
confidential
nature
that
paddington
intended
to
make
the
same
move
and
lay
it
to
the
work
of
the
police
not
only
to
scare
poor
old
jimmy
out
of
town
but
to
obtain
possession
of
the
outfit
himself
and
destroy
the
evidence
in
case
the
old
forger
was
caught
and
lost
his
spirit
and
confessed
implicating
him
i
did
not
know
the
raid
would
be
discovered
and
the
warning
take
effect
so
soon
i
had
arranged
to
have
the
brunells
watched
and
tailed
later
in
the
day
but
they
escaped
my
espionage
i
shall
at
once
set
the
wheels
in
motion
to
discover
the
number
of
the
taxicab
in
which
they
went
away
and
i
will
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
find
their
ultimate
destination
and
see
that
no
harm
comes
to
either
of
them
you
may
depend
upon
that
i
do
mind
going
a
little
further
with
this
subject
with
you
now
than
i
have
before
and
i
tell
you
confidentially
that
i
believe
whatever
part
jimmy
played
in
this
conspiracy
in
forging
the
letter
note
and
signatures
was
a
compulsory
one
and
in
the
end
we
shall
be
able
to
clear
him
you
know
that
i
am
a
man
of
my
word
guy
i
want
you
to
go
on
with
this
case
under
my
instructions
and
leave
the
search
for
the
brunells
absolutely
in
my
hands
will
you
do
this
on
my
assurance
that
i
will
find
them
if
i
can
have
your
word
sir
that
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
i
may
go
to
her
to
emily
and
tell
her
the
truth
morrow
replied
earnestly
you
do
know
what
it
means
to
me
to
have
her
feel
that
i
have
been
such
a
dog
as
not
to
mean
a
word
of
all
that
i
said
to
her
to
have
her
believe
that
it
was
all
part
of
a
plan
to
trap
her
into
betraying
her
father
it
drives
me
almost
mad
when
i
think
of
it
this
inaction
the
suspense
of
it
is
intolerable
then
go
home
and
find
out
who
fired
at
you
from
the
window
of
your
own
house
watch
the
brunell
cottage
too
there
will
be
developments
there
if
i
not
mistaken
i
may
want
you
to
go
out
on
another
branch
of
this
investigation
the
search
for
ramon
hamilton
very
good
sir
i
try
morrow
promised
with
obvious
reluctance
i
know
how
busy
you
are
and
how
much
every
day
counts
in
this
matter
just
now
but
for
god
sake
do
what
you
can
to
find
the
brunells
for
me
blaine
repeated
his
assurances
and
morrow
returned
to
the
bronx
with
considerably
lightened
spirits
the
sight
of
the
little
cottage
across
the
way
dark
and
deserted
brought
a
pang
to
his
heart
but
it
also
served
to
remind
him
of
the
duty
which
lay
before
him
he
must
find
out
whose
hand
had
fired
that
shot
at
him
from
the
house
which
had
given
him
shelter
quinlan
had
not
yet
retired
he
found
her
reading
a
newspaper
in
the
kitchen
with
caliban
curled
up
in
drowsy
content
beside
the
stove
cold
out
ai
it
she
observed
i
went
round
to
the
store
an
i
like
to
froze
before
i
got
back
they
said
they
send
the
things
but
they
did
i
go
get
them
for
you
offered
morrow
was
it
the
grocery
to
which
you
went
no
the
drug
store
i
i
got
a
new
lodger
upstairs
at
the
back
an
old
gentleman
who
kind
of
sickly
and
rheumatic
and
he
asked
me
to
get
some
things
for
him
thank
you
just
the
same
morrow
but
there
ai
no
hurry
for
them
quinlan
wide
ingenuous
face
flushed
and
for
a
moment
she
seemed
curiously
embarrassed
could
she
have
guessed
that
the
revolver
shot
which
had
created
so
much
excitement
that
afternoon
had
been
fired
from
beneath
her
roof
a
new
lodger
repeated
morrow
came
did
he
no
yesterday
she
responded
quickly
too
quickly
the
operative
fancied
the
ruddy
flush
had
deepened
on
her
cheek
and
she
added
as
if
unable
to
restrain
the
question
rising
irresistibly
to
her
lips
what
made
you
think
he
came
i
thought
this
afternoon
that
i
heard
furniture
being
moved
about
in
the
room
directly
over
mine
he
returned
with
studied
indifference
oh
you
did
quinlan
affirmed
that
my
room
you
know
i
was
exchanging
my
bureau
for
the
old
gentleman
let
me
see
that
makes
four
lodgers
now
does
it
morrow
remarked
thoughtfully
as
he
toasted
his
back
near
the
stove
peterson
the
shoe
clerk
acker
the
photographer
me
and
now
this
old
gentleman
what
his
name
by
the
way
brown
again
there
was
that
obvious
hesitation
followed
by
a
hasty
rush
of
words
as
if
to
cover
it
yes
my
house
is
full
now
and
i
think
i
mighty
lucky
considering
the
time
of
year
just
think
it
most
christmas
the
winter
just
flyin
along
the
next
morning
from
his
bed
morrow
heard
the
clinking
of
china
on
a
tray
as
quinlan
laboriously
carried
breakfast
upstairs
to
her
new
boarder
guy
rose
quickly
and
dressed
and
when
he
heard
her
descending
again
he
flung
open
his
door
and
met
her
face
to
face
quite
as
if
by
accident
she
started
violently
at
the
sudden
encounter
and
nearly
dropped
the
tray
land
sakes
how
you
scared
me
mr
morrow
she
exclaimed
you
up
earlier
than
usual
i
have
your
breakfast
ready
in
the
in
ten
minutes
she
hurried
on
quickly
but
not
before
the
operative
keen
eyes
had
noted
in
one
lightning
glance
the
contents
of
the
tray
upon
it
was
a
teapot
as
well
as
one
for
coffee
and
service
for
two
peterson
and
acker
had
both
long
since
gone
to
their
usual
day
work
quinlan
had
lied
then
after
all
she
had
two
new
lodgers
instead
of
the
single
rheumatic
old
gentleman
she
had
pictured
two
and
one
of
them
had
entered
his
own
room
and
from
the
window
fired
that
shot
across
the
street
at
him
as
he
bent
over
the
lamp
in
the
brunell
cottage
he
had
one
problematic
advantage
it
was
possible
that
he
had
not
been
recognized
as
the
intruder
in
the
deserted
house
he
must
contrive
by
hook
or
crook
to
obtain
a
glimpse
of
the
mysterious
newcomers
and
learn
the
cause
of
their
interest
in
the
brunells
and
their
affairs
they
were
in
all
probability
emissaries
of
paddington
possibly
one
of
them
was
charley
pennold
himself
at
that
same
moment
henry
blaine
sat
in
his
office
receiving
the
report
of
ross
one
of
his
minor
operatives
i
tried
the
tobacconist
shop
yesterday
morning
sir
but
there
was
any
message
there
for
paddington
and
although
i
waited
around
a
couple
of
hours
he
did
show
up
ross
was
saying
this
morning
however
i
tried
the
same
stunt
and
it
worked
i
was
any
too
quick
about
it
either
for
paddington
was
just
after
me
i
strolled
in
asked
for
a
package
of
cairos
and
gave
the
man
the
office
as
you
told
me
he
handed
it
over
like
a
lamb
and
i
walked
out
with
it
straight
to
that
little
café
across
the
way
i
had
four
of
the
boys
waiting
there
and
my
entrance
was
a
signal
to
them
to
beat
it
over
and
buy
enough
tobacco
to
keep
the
shopkeeper
busy
while
i
made
a
getaway
from
the
place
i
only
went
three
doors
down
to
a
barber
and
while
i
was
waiting
my
turn
there
i
watched
the
street
from
behind
a
newspaper
in
about
ten
minutes
paddington
came
along
walking
as
if
he
was
in
quite
a
hurry
he
went
into
the
tobacconist
but
he
came
out
quicker
than
he
had
entered
and
his
face
was
a
study
purple
with
rage
one
minute
and
white
with
fear
the
next
i
do
believe
he
knows
yet
who
tailing
him
sir
but
he
looks
as
if
he
realized
we
had
him
coming
and
going
he
went
straight
over
to
the
little
restaurant
with
murder
in
his
eye
but
he
only
stayed
a
minute
or
two
i
tailed
him
home
to
his
rooms
and
he
stamped
along
at
first
as
if
he
was
so
mad
he
did
care
whether
he
was
followed
or
not
when
he
got
near
his
own
street
though
he
got
cautious
again
and
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
keep
him
from
catching
me
on
his
trail
he
a
sharp
one
when
he
wants
to
be
and
he
on
his
mettle
now
i
know
the
breed
he
turn
and
fight
like
any
other
rat
if
cornered
but
meanwhile
he
try
at
any
cost
to
get
away
from
us
blaine
responded
you
have
him
well
covered
ross
thorpe
is
waiting
in
a
car
a
few
doors
away
vanner
in
a
taxi
and
daly
is
on
the
job
until
i
get
back
he
wo
take
a
step
without
being
tailed
the
operative
answered
confidently
here
the
cigarette
box
sir
i
opened
it
as
soon
as
i
got
in
the
restaurant
to
see
if
it
was
the
real
goods
and
not
a
plant
as
you
instructed
it
the
straight
tip
all
right
there
were
no
cigarettes
inside
only
this
single
sheet
of
paper
covered
with
little
marks
looks
like
music
only
it
is
i
do
know
much
about
but
some
of
those
figures
could
be
played
on
any
instrument
henry
blaine
opened
the
little
box
and
drew
from
it
the
bit
of
folded
paper
which
he
spread
out
upon
the
desk
before
him
a
glance
was
sufficient
to
show
him
that
it
was
another
cryptic
message
similar
to
that
which
guy
morrow
had
found
in
the
brunells
deserted
cottage
and
which
he
had
vainly
studied
until
far
into
the
night
very
good
ross
get
back
on
the
job
now
and
report
any
developments
as
soon
as
you
have
an
opportunity
when
the
operative
had
gone
blaine
drew
forth
the
cryptogram
received
the
previous
evening
and
compared
the
two
they
were
identical
in
character
although
from
the
formation
of
the
letters
and
figures
the
message
each
conveyed
was
a
different
one
the
first
had
baffled
him
and
he
scrutinized
the
second
with
freshly
awakened
interest
illustration
an
image
of
a
coded
message
is
shown
here
in
the
text
the
three
lines
fascinated
him
by
their
tantalizing
problem
and
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
them
the
musical
notes
could
be
easily
read
in
place
of
letters
of
course
with
the
sign
of
the
treble
clef
as
a
basic
guide
but
the
other
figures
still
puzzled
him
all
at
once
a
word
upon
the
lowest
line
which
explained
itself
caught
his
eye
then
another
and
another
until
the
method
of
deciphering
the
whole
message
burst
upon
his
mind
one
swift
gesture
a
few
eagerly
scrawled
calculations
and
the
truth
was
plain
to
him
calling
his
secretary
he
hastily
dictated
a
letter
i
want
a
copy
of
that
sent
at
once
by
special
delivery
to
every
physician
and
surgeon
in
town
no
matter
how
obscure
see
to
it
that
not
one
is
overlooked
even
those
on
the
staffs
of
the
different
hospitals
must
be
notified
although
they
are
the
least
likely
to
be
called
upon
above
all
do
forget
the
old
retired
one
those
of
shady
professional
reputation
and
the
fledglings
just
out
of
medical
colleges
it
a
large
order
marsh
but
it
bound
to
bring
some
result
in
the
next
hours
with
the
closing
of
the
door
behind
his
secretary
henry
blaine
rose
and
paced
thoughtfully
back
and
forth
the
length
of
his
spacious
office
the
problem
before
him
was
the
most
salient
in
its
importance
of
any
which
had
confronted
him
during
his
investigation
of
the
lawton
mystery
probably
the
weightiest
of
his
entire
career
should
he
dared
he
throw
caution
to
the
winds
and
step
out
into
the
open
in
his
true
colors
at
last
it
was
as
if
he
held
within
his
hands
the
kernel
of
the
mystery
yet
surrounded
still
by
an
invulnerable
shield
of
cunning
and
duplicity
with
which
the
master
criminals
had
so
carefully
their
conspiracy
he
held
it
within
his
hands
and
yet
he
could
not
break
the
shell
of
the
mystery
and
expose
the
kernel
of
truth
to
justice
there
seemed
to
be
no
interstice
no
crevice
into
which
he
might
insert
the
keen
probe
of
his
marvelous
deductive
power
and
yet
his
experience
told
him
that
there
must
be
some
rift
some
hiatus
in
the
scheme
if
only
he
could
discover
that
rift
could
prove
beyond
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
the
facts
which
he
had
circumstantially
established
he
would
not
hesitate
to
lay
his
hands
upon
the
culprits
high
in
power
and
influence
throughout
the
country
as
they
were
and
bring
them
before
any
court
of
justice
however
it
might
be
undermined
by
bribery
and
corruption
he
had
accomplished
much
working
as
a
mole
works
in
the
dark
could
he
not
accomplish
more
by
declaring
himself
could
he
not
by
one
bold
stroke
lay
bare
the
heart
of
the
mystery
seating
himself
again
at
his
desk
he
took
the
telephone
receiver
from
its
hook
and
called
up
anita
lawton
at
her
home
not
upon
the
private
wire
he
had
had
installed
for
her
but
on
the
regular
house
wire
oh
blaine
what
is
it
have
you
found
him
have
you
news
for
me
of
ramon
her
voice
faint
and
with
the
hideous
suspense
of
the
days
just
past
came
to
him
tremulous
with
eagerness
and
an
abiding
hope
no
miss
lawton
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
have
not
yet
found
hamilton
but
i
have
definite
information
that
he
still
lives
at
least
he
returned
i
hope
that
in
a
few
days
at
most
i
may
bring
him
to
you
thank
heaven
for
that
she
responded
fervently
i
have
tried
so
hard
to
believe
to
have
faith
that
he
will
be
restored
to
me
and
yet
the
hideous
doubt
will
return
again
and
again
these
days
and
nights
have
been
one
long
ceaseless
torture
you
have
taken
my
advice
in
regard
to
receiving
your
visitors
oh
yes
blaine
my
three
guardians
have
been
unremitting
in
their
attentions
particularly
rockamore
who
calls
daily
he
has
just
left
me
miss
lawton
i
have
decided
that
the
time
has
come
for
us
to
declare
ourselves
openly
not
in
regard
to
the
mystery
of
your
insolvency
but
concerning
the
disappearance
of
ramon
hamilton
i
want
you
to
call
his
mother
up
on
the
telephone
as
soon
as
i
ring
off
and
tell
her
that
you
have
resolved
to
retain
me
on
your
account
to
find
him
for
you
should
she
put
forward
any
objections
her
and
refuse
to
listen
i
will
be
with
you
in
an
hour
in
the
meantime
should
anyone
call
you
may
tell
them
that
you
have
just
retained
me
to
investigate
the
disappearance
of
your
fiancé
tell
that
to
anyone
and
everyone
the
more
publicity
we
give
to
that
fact
the
better
the
moment
has
arrived
for
us
to
carry
war
into
the
enemy
camp
and
i
know
that
we
shall
win
keep
up
your
courage
miss
lawton
we
done
with
maneuvering
now
you
borne
up
bravely
but
i
believe
your
period
of
suspense
in
regard
to
many
things
is
past
before
this
day
is
done
they
will
know
that
we
are
in
this
to
fight
to
the
finish
and
to
fight
to
win
chapter
xv
checkmate
henry
blaine
was
allowed
scant
opportunity
for
reflection
in
the
hour
which
intervened
between
his
telephone
message
to
anita
and
the
time
of
his
appointment
with
her
scarcely
had
he
hung
up
the
receiver
once
more
when
his
secretary
announced
the
arrival
of
fifine
déchaussée
had
not
blaine
been
already
aware
of
her
success
with
paddington
as
the
scene
in
the
park
an
evening
or
two
previously
denoted
he
would
have
been
instantly
apprised
by
her
manner
that
something
of
vital
import
had
occurred
there
was
an
indefinable
change
a
subtle
metamorphosis
which
was
conveyed
even
in
her
appearance
her
delicate
face
had
lost
its
pallor
and
was
flushed
with
a
faint
exquisite
rose
the
wooden
slightly
vacant
expression
was
gone
she
walked
with
a
lissome
conscious
grace
which
he
had
not
before
observed
and
the
slow
enigmatic
smile
with
which
she
greeted
him
held
much
that
was
significant
behind
it
you
did
not
keep
your
appointment
with
me
yesterday
why
mademoiselle
asked
blaine
quietly
because
it
was
impossible
she
returned
i
could
not
get
away
madame
the
wife
of
franklin
would
not
allow
me
to
leave
the
children
this
is
the
first
opportunity
i
have
had
to
come
and
what
have
you
to
report
he
asked
watching
her
narrowly
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
very
little
blaine
yesterday
the
president
of
the
street
railways
mallowe
called
on
the
minister
and
remained
for
more
than
an
hour
i
could
not
hear
their
conversation
they
were
in
the
library
but
just
as
mallowe
was
taking
his
departure
i
passed
through
the
hall
and
heard
him
say
must
try
to
persuade
her
franklin
you
have
more
influence
over
her
than
anyone
else
even
i
miss
lawton
must
really
go
away
for
a
time
it
is
the
only
thing
that
will
save
her
health
her
reason
she
can
do
nothing
here
to
aid
in
the
search
for
young
hamilton
and
the
suspense
is
killing
her
try
to
get
her
to
take
our
advice
and
go
away
if
only
for
a
few
days
what
did
franklin
reply
i
did
not
hear
it
all
i
could
not
linger
in
the
hall
without
arousing
suspicion
franklin
agreed
that
miss
lawton
was
ill
and
should
go
away
and
he
said
he
would
try
to
induce
her
to
go
that
mallowe
was
undoubtedly
right
and
he
was
delighted
that
he
took
such
an
interest
in
miss
lawton
she
paused
and
after
a
moment
blaine
asked
and
that
is
all
yes
the
french
girl
half
turned
as
if
to
take
her
departure
but
he
stayed
her
by
a
gesture
you
have
nothing
else
to
report
how
about
paddington
he
shot
the
question
at
her
tersely
his
eyes
never
leaving
her
face
but
she
did
not
flinch
paddington
she
repeated
demurely
i
have
nothing
to
tell
you
of
him
you
did
try
then
to
lead
him
on
as
i
suggested
to
get
him
to
talk
about
miss
lawton
or
the
people
who
were
employing
him
you
have
not
seen
him
blaine
i
could
not
do
that
she
cried
ignoring
his
last
question
i
would
do
much
anything
that
i
could
for
miss
lawton
but
she
would
be
the
last
to
ask
of
me
that
i
should
lead
a
man
on
to
to
make
love
to
me
in
order
to
betray
him
i
will
do
anything
that
is
possible
to
find
out
for
miss
lawton
and
for
you
all
that
i
can
by
keeping
my
ears
open
in
the
house
of
the
minister
but
as
to
paddington
i
will
not
play
such
a
rôle
with
any
man
even
to
please
miss
lawton
yet
you
have
been
meeting
him
in
the
park
the
detective
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
and
spoke
gently
as
if
merely
reminding
the
girl
of
some
insignificant
fact
which
she
had
presumably
forgotten
yet
there
was
that
in
his
tone
which
made
her
stiffen
and
she
replied
impulsively
with
a
warning
flash
of
her
eyes
what
do
you
mean
how
do
you
know
i
i
told
you
i
had
nothing
to
report
concerning
paddington
nothing
which
could
be
of
service
to
miss
lawton
and
it
is
quite
true
i
i
did
meet
paddington
in
the
park
but
it
was
simply
an
accident
and
was
the
locket
and
chain
an
accident
too
that
locket
which
you
are
wearing
at
the
present
moment
mademoiselle
the
locket
her
hand
strayed
to
her
neck
and
convulsively
clasped
the
bauble
of
cheap
bright
gold
hanging
there
what
do
you
know
of
my
locket
blaine
i
know
that
paddington
purchased
it
for
you
two
or
three
days
ago
that
he
gave
it
to
you
that
night
in
the
park
and
you
allowed
him
to
take
you
in
his
arms
and
kiss
you
stop
how
can
you
know
that
she
stormed
at
him
stepping
forward
slightly
a
deep
flush
dyeing
her
face
he
did
not
tell
you
you
have
had
me
watched
followed
spied
upon
it
is
intolerable
to
think
that
i
should
be
treated
as
if
i
were
unworthy
of
trust
i
have
been
faithful
loyal
to
miss
lawton
but
this
is
too
much
i
have
not
questioned
paddington
i
know
nothing
of
his
affairs
but
i
like
him
i
i
admire
him
very
much
and
if
i
desire
to
meet
him
to
receive
his
attentions
i
shall
do
so
i
am
not
harming
miss
lawton
who
has
been
my
my
one
friend
in
this
strange
big
country
paddington
does
not
know
that
i
am
working
at
franklin
under
your
instructions
and
i
shall
never
betray
to
him
the
confidence
miss
lawton
has
reposed
in
me
but
i
shall
do
no
more
it
is
finished
that
i
should
be
suspected
but
you
are
not
my
dear
young
woman
interposed
blaine
mildly
it
was
not
you
who
was
followed
spied
upon
as
you
call
it
for
miss
lawton
sake
because
she
is
in
trouble
we
are
interested
just
now
in
paddington
movements
and
naturally
my
operative
was
not
aware
that
it
was
to
meet
you
he
went
to
the
park
fifine
exclaimed
the
color
had
receded
from
her
face
and
a
deathly
white
pallor
had
superseded
it
she
retreated
a
step
or
two
and
continued
defiantly
this
afternoon
i
resign
from
the
service
of
franklin
i
do
not
believe
that
paddington
is
an
enemy
of
miss
lawton
nothing
shall
make
me
believe
that
he
who
is
the
soul
of
honor
of
chivalry
would
harm
her
or
cause
her
any
trouble
and
i
do
not
like
this
work
this
spying
and
treachery
and
deceit
that
is
your
profession
not
mine
i
only
consented
because
miss
lawton
had
been
kind
to
me
and
i
desired
to
aid
her
in
her
trouble
if
i
could
but
that
he
that
i
should
be
suspected
and
watched
and
treated
like
criminals
oh
it
is
insufferable
also
i
leave
the
anita
lawton
club
you
shall
find
some
one
else
to
play
detective
for
you
you
and
miss
lawton
with
an
indignant
swirl
of
her
skirts
she
turned
and
made
for
the
door
in
a
tempest
of
rage
but
on
the
threshold
his
voice
stayed
her
wait
miss
lawton
has
befriended
you
and
now
because
of
a
man
of
whom
you
know
nothing
you
desert
her
cause
is
that
loyalty
mademoiselle
we
shall
not
ask
you
to
remain
at
franklin
any
longer
miss
lawton
does
not
wish
unwilling
service
from
anyone
but
for
your
own
sake
go
back
to
the
club
and
remain
there
until
a
position
is
open
to
you
which
is
to
your
liking
you
are
a
young
girl
in
a
strange
country
as
you
say
and
at
least
you
know
the
club
to
be
a
safe
place
for
you
do
not
trust
this
man
paddington
or
anyone
else
it
is
not
wise
i
shall
not
listen
to
you
she
cried
her
voice
rising
shrill
and
in
her
excitement
you
shall
not
say
such
things
of
paddington
he
is
brave
and
good
while
you
you
are
a
spy
an
eavesdropper
a
delver
into
the
private
affairs
of
others
i
do
not
know
what
this
trouble
may
be
which
miss
lawton
is
in
and
i
am
sorry
for
her
that
she
should
suffer
but
i
shall
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
case
nor
with
you
revoir
whew
breathed
blaine
to
himself
as
the
door
closed
after
her
with
a
slam
what
a
firebrand
she
may
not
have
actually
betrayed
us
to
paddington
in
so
many
words
but
it
is
necessary
to
look
far
for
the
one
who
warned
him
that
he
was
being
watched
and
put
him
on
his
guard
all
unknowingly
that
the
whole
scheme
in
which
he
is
so
deeply
involved
was
in
jeopardy
oh
these
women
let
them
once
lose
their
heads
over
a
man
and
they
upset
all
one
plans
blaine
arrived
promptly
within
the
hour
at
the
house
on
belleair
avenue
anita
lawton
received
him
as
before
in
the
library
he
observed
with
deep
concern
that
she
was
a
mere
shadow
of
her
former
self
the
slenderness
which
had
been
one
of
her
girlish
charms
had
become
almost
emaciation
her
eyes
were
glassily
bright
and
in
the
waxen
pallor
of
her
cheeks
a
feverish
red
spot
burned
she
smiled
wanly
as
he
pressed
her
hand
and
her
pale
lips
trembled
but
no
words
came
my
poor
child
the
great
detective
found
himself
saying
from
the
depths
of
his
fatherly
heart
you
are
positively
ill
this
will
never
do
you
are
not
keeping
your
promise
to
me
i
am
trying
hard
to
mr
blaine
anita
motioned
toward
a
chair
and
sank
into
another
with
a
little
gasp
of
sheer
exhaustion
you
have
never
failed
yet
and
you
have
given
me
your
word
that
you
would
bring
ramon
back
to
me
i
try
to
have
faith
but
with
every
hour
that
passes
hope
dies
within
me
and
i
can
feel
that
my
strength
my
will
to
believe
is
dying
too
i
know
that
you
must
be
doing
your
utmost
exerting
every
effort
and
yet
i
can
not
resist
the
longing
to
urge
you
on
to
try
to
express
to
you
the
torture
of
uncertainty
and
dread
which
consumes
me
unceasingly
that
my
father
fortune
is
gone
means
nothing
to
me
now
only
give
me
back
ramon
alive
and
well
and
i
shall
ask
no
more
i
hope
to
be
able
to
do
that
speedily
blaine
returned
as
i
told
you
over
the
telephone
i
have
positive
proof
that
he
is
alive
and
a
definite
clue
as
to
his
whereabouts
you
must
ask
me
nothing
further
now
only
try
to
find
faith
in
your
heart
for
just
a
few
days
perhaps
hours
longer
you
to
hamilton
as
i
suggested
yes
she
demurred
at
first
dreading
the
notoriety
and
not
not
appearing
to
believe
in
your
ability
as
i
do
but
i
simply
refused
to
listen
to
her
objections
carlis
called
me
up
shortly
afterward
and
wanted
to
know
if
i
would
be
able
to
receive
him
this
afternoon
on
a
matter
connected
with
my
finances
but
i
told
him
i
had
retained
you
to
search
for
ramon
and
was
expecting
you
at
any
moment
he
seemed
greatly
astonished
and
warned
me
of
the
he
called
it
expense
he
begged
me
not
to
be
impatient
to
wait
until
i
had
time
to
think
the
matter
over
and
consult
himself
and
mallowe
saying
that
they
were
both
doing
all
that
could
be
done
to
locate
ramon
and
rockamore
was
also
but
i
told
him
it
was
too
late
that
you
were
on
your
way
here
that
was
right
i
am
glad
you
told
him
the
fact
that
you
have
retained
me
to
search
for
hamilton
will
appear
as
a
scoop
in
every
evening
paper
which
he
controls
now
and
the
more
publicity
given
to
it
the
better
you
told
me
over
the
that
rockamore
calls
upon
you
every
day
yes
i
try
to
be
cordial
to
him
but
for
some
reason
which
i
explain
i
dislike
him
more
than
either
of
the
others
i
do
know
why
he
comes
so
often
for
he
says
very
little
only
sits
and
stares
at
that
chair
the
chair
in
which
my
father
died
until
i
feel
that
i
should
like
to
scream
it
seems
to
exert
the
same
strange
uncanny
influence
over
him
as
it
does
over
me
that
chair
more
than
once
when
he
has
been
announced
i
have
entered
to
find
him
standing
close
beside
it
looking
down
at
it
as
if
my
father
were
seated
there
once
more
and
he
was
talking
to
him
i
do
in
the
least
know
why
but
the
thought
seems
to
prey
on
my
mind
perhaps
because
the
chair
fascinates
me
too
in
a
queer
way
that
is
half
repulsion
you
are
morbid
miss
lawton
you
must
not
allow
such
fancies
to
grow
or
they
will
soon
take
possession
of
you
in
your
weakened
state
and
become
an
obsession
tell
me
have
you
heard
anything
from
the
club
girls
we
established
in
your
guardian
offices
oh
yes
i
had
forgotten
completely
in
my
excitement
and
joy
over
your
news
of
ramon
vague
though
it
is
that
there
was
something
important
which
i
wanted
to
tell
you
since
margaret
dismissal
all
my
girls
have
been
sent
away
from
the
positions
i
obtained
for
them
all
except
fifine
déchaussée
and
she
resigned
not
an
hour
ago
remarked
the
detective
rather
grimly
supplementing
the
fact
with
as
many
details
as
he
thought
necessary
anita
listened
in
silence
until
he
had
finished
poor
girl
poor
fifine
what
a
pity
that
she
should
fancy
herself
in
love
with
such
a
man
as
you
describe
this
paddington
to
be
she
must
be
persuaded
to
remain
in
the
club
of
course
we
can
not
allow
her
to
leave
us
now
i
feel
responsible
for
her
and
especially
so
since
it
was
indirectly
because
of
me
or
while
she
was
in
my
service
at
any
rate
that
she
met
this
man
if
she
is
all
that
you
say
she
could
never
be
happy
if
she
married
him
there
small
chance
of
that
he
has
a
wife
already
she
left
him
years
ago
and
runs
a
somewhere
on
hill
street
i
believe
blaine
replied
i
do
fancy
he
add
bigamy
to
the
rest
of
his
nefarious
acts
but
tell
me
of
the
other
girls
they
did
not
report
to
me
poor
little
agnes
olson
was
dismissed
yesterday
she
is
a
spineless
sort
of
creature
you
know
without
much
or
initiative
and
i
believe
she
had
quite
a
scene
with
carlis
before
she
left
she
was
on
the
switchboard
if
you
remember
and
as
well
as
i
was
able
to
understand
from
her
he
caught
her
listening
in
on
his
private
connection
she
reached
the
club
in
an
hysterical
condition
and
i
told
them
to
put
her
to
bed
and
care
for
her
i
ought
to
be
there
myself
now
at
work
for
i
have
lost
my
best
helper
but
i
am
too
distraught
over
ramon
to
think
of
anything
else
my
secretary
the
girl
you
saw
there
at
the
club
and
asked
me
about
do
you
remember
did
not
appear
yesterday
but
telephoned
her
resignation
saying
she
was
leaving
town
i
can
not
understand
it
for
i
would
have
counted
on
her
faithfulness
before
any
of
the
rest
but
so
many
things
have
happened
lately
which
i
comprehend
so
many
mysteries
and
disappointments
and
anxieties
that
i
can
scarcely
think
or
feel
any
more
it
seems
as
if
i
were
really
dead
as
if
my
emotions
were
all
used
up
i
ca
cry
even
when
i
think
of
ramon
i
can
only
suffer
i
know
i
can
imagine
what
you
must
be
trying
to
endure
just
now
miss
lawton
but
please
believe
that
it
will
not
last
much
longer
and
do
worry
about
your
secretary
emily
brunell
will
be
with
you
again
soon
i
think
emily
brunell
repeated
anita
in
surprise
you
know
then
yes
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
she
is
indirectly
concerned
in
the
conspiracy
against
you
but
innocently
so
you
will
understand
everything
some
day
what
about
the
irish
girl
loretta
murfree
president
mallowe
filing
clerk
he
dismissed
her
only
this
morning
on
a
charge
of
incompetence
he
has
been
systematically
finding
fault
with
her
for
several
days
as
if
trying
to
discover
a
pretext
for
discharging
her
so
she
was
unprepared
she
here
now
having
some
lunch
up
in
my
would
you
like
to
talk
with
her
i
would
indeed
he
assented
nodding
as
anita
pressed
the
bell
she
seemed
the
brightest
and
most
young
woman
of
the
lot
if
anyone
could
have
obtained
information
of
value
to
us
i
fancy
she
could
did
she
have
anything
to
say
to
you
about
mr
mallowe
i
would
rather
she
told
you
herself
anita
replied
hesitatingly
with
the
ghost
of
a
smile
whatever
she
said
about
him
was
strictly
personal
and
of
a
distinctly
uncomplimentary
nature
there
is
nothing
spineless
about
loretta
when
the
young
irish
girl
appeared
in
response
to
anita
summons
her
eyes
and
mouth
opened
wide
in
amazement
at
sight
of
the
detective
oh
sir
it
you
she
exclaimed
i
was
going
down
to
your
office
this
afternoon
to
tell
you
that
i
had
been
discharged
mallowe
himself
turned
me
off
this
morning
i
not
saying
this
to
excuse
myself
but
it
was
honestly
through
no
fault
of
mine
the
old
man
gentleman
has
been
trying
for
days
to
get
rid
of
me
i
knew
it
so
i
been
especially
careful
in
my
work
and
cheerful
and
smiling
whenever
he
appeared
on
the
scene
like
this
she
favored
them
with
a
grimace
which
was
more
like
the
impishly
derisive
grin
of
a
street
urchin
than
a
respectful
smile
and
continued
this
morning
i
caught
him
mixing
up
the
letters
in
the
files
with
his
own
hands
and
when
he
blamed
me
for
it
later
i
saw
that
it
was
no
use
he
was
bound
to
get
rid
of
me
in
some
way
or
another
so
i
tell
him
what
i
thought
of
him
but
came
away
peaceably
which
is
a
lot
to
ask
of
anybody
with
a
drop
of
irish
blood
in
their
veins
in
a
case
like
that
however
i
learned
enough
while
i
was
in
that
office
of
his
manipulations
of
the
street
railway
stock
to
make
me
glad
got
a
profession
and
am
not
sitting
around
waiting
for
dividends
to
be
paid
if
the
people
ever
wake
up
and
the
district
attorney
indicts
him
i
hope
to
goodness
they
put
me
on
the
stand
that
all
why
has
he
tried
to
get
rid
of
you
do
you
think
he
suspected
the
motive
for
your
being
in
his
employ
asked
blaine
when
she
paused
for
breath
no
he
could
for
i
never
gave
him
a
chance
she
responded
a
sly
one
too
padding
around
the
offices
like
a
cat
in
his
soft
slippers
and
he
looks
for
all
the
world
like
a
cat
with
the
sleek
white
whiskers
of
him
excuse
me
miss
lawton
i
do
mean
to
be
disrespectful
but
he
trying
the
old
gentleman
is
i
think
he
got
suspicious
of
me
when
margaret
hefferman
made
such
a
botch
of
her
job
with
rockamore
and
yesterday
afternoon
when
carlis
caught
agnes
olson
listening
in
oh
i
know
all
about
that
too
he
got
desperate
that
why
he
mixed
up
the
files
this
morning
for
an
excuse
to
discharge
me
how
did
you
know
about
agnes
olson
asked
blaine
quickly
did
she
tell
you
no
i
heard
it
from
carlis
himself
returned
loretta
with
a
reminiscent
grin
he
came
right
straight
around
to
mallowe
and
told
him
all
about
it
and
a
towering
rage
he
was
in
too
you
think
the
little
devil
sold
us
he
asked
meaning
no
disrespect
to
you
miss
lawton
it
was
you
he
was
talking
about
for
he
added
gets
her
girls
into
our
offices
on
a
whining
plea
of
charity
and
they
all
turn
out
crooked
spying
and
listening
in
and
taking
notes
remember
rockamore
experience
with
the
one
he
took
do
you
suppose
that
innocent
brat
of
pennington
suspects
us
your
tongue
for
god
sake
old
mallowe
growled
at
him
got
one
of
them
in
there
a
filing
clerk
you
better
get
rid
of
her
before
she
tries
any
tricks
carlis
said
believe
that
girl
is
deeper
than
she
looks
for
all
her
trusting
way
i
always
did
think
she
took
the
news
of
her
father
bankruptcy
too
d
n
calmly
to
be
natural
even
under
the
circumstances
kick
her
protégée
out
mallowe
unless
looking
for
more
trouble
i
not
what
did
mallowe
reply
blaine
asked
i
do
know
his
private
secretary
came
into
the
office
where
i
was
just
then
and
i
had
to
pretend
to
be
busy
to
head
off
any
suspicion
from
him
carlis
left
soon
after
and
i
could
feel
his
eyes
boring
into
the
back
of
my
neck
as
he
passed
through
the
room
mallowe
sent
for
me
almost
immediately
to
find
an
old
letter
for
him
from
one
of
the
files
of
two
years
ago
and
it
was
funny
the
suspicious
worried
way
he
kept
watching
me
there
is
nothing
else
you
can
tell
us
the
detective
inquired
nothing
out
of
the
usual
run
happened
while
you
were
there
nothing
except
that
a
couple
of
days
ago
he
had
an
awful
row
with
a
man
who
called
on
him
it
was
about
money
matters
i
think
and
the
old
gentleman
got
very
much
excited
a
cent
he
kept
repeating
louder
and
louder
until
he
fairly
shouted
one
more
cent
will
you
get
from
me
this
systematic
extortion
of
yours
must
come
to
an
end
here
and
now
i
done
all
i
going
to
and
you
better
understand
that
clearly
then
the
other
man
the
visitor
got
angry
too
and
they
went
at
it
hammer
and
tongs
at
last
mallowe
must
have
lost
his
head
completely
for
he
accused
the
other
man
of
robbing
his
safe
at
that
the
visitor
got
calm
and
cool
as
a
cucumber
all
of
a
sudden
and
began
to
question
mallowe
it
seems
from
what
i
heard
i
ca
recall
the
exact
words
that
not
very
long
ago
the
night
watchman
in
the
offices
was
chloroformed
and
the
safe
ransacked
but
nothing
was
taken
except
a
letter
mad
the
strange
man
said
in
h
l
should
anybody
take
a
letter
and
leave
packets
of
bonds
and
other
securities
lying
about
untouched
the
letter
happens
to
be
one
you
would
very
much
like
to
have
in
your
possession
paddington
the
old
gentleman
said
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
the
visitor
name
was
paddington
but
that
does
matter
does
it
you
know
what
it
was
mallowe
went
on
was
a
certain
letter
which
pennington
lawton
wrote
to
me
from
long
bay
two
years
ago
now
do
you
understand
fool
said
paddington
fool
to
keep
it
you
gave
your
word
that
you
would
destroy
it
why
did
you
i
thought
it
might
come
in
useful
some
day
just
as
it
has
now
the
old
gentleman
fairly
whined
was
good
circumstantial
evidence
fine
paddington
said
with
a
bitter
kind
of
a
laugh
evidence
for
whoever
got
it
now
know
very
well
who
got
it
cried
mallowe
do
pull
the
wool
over
my
eyes
and
i
do
mean
to
buy
it
back
from
you
either
if
that
your
game
you
can
keep
it
for
all
i
care
served
its
purpose
now
and
you
wo
get
another
penny
from
me
well
i
wish
you
could
have
heard
them
then
loretta
continued
with
gusto
they
carried
on
terribly
the
whole
office
could
hear
them
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
the
strange
man
paddington
denying
right
up
to
the
last
that
he
knew
anything
about
the
robbery
and
mallowe
accusing
him
and
threatening
and
bluffing
it
out
for
all
he
was
worth
but
in
the
end
he
paid
the
man
some
money
for
i
remember
he
insisted
on
having
the
check
certified
and
the
secretary
himself
took
it
over
to
the
bank
i
do
know
for
what
amount
it
was
drawn
why
did
you
tell
me
that
before
loretta
asked
anita
reproachfully
i
mean
about
the
the
names
carlis
called
me
and
his
suspicions
i
wish
i
known
it
half
an
hour
ago
when
he
telephoned
to
me
that
just
why
i
did
tell
you
miss
lawton
responded
loretta
with
a
flash
of
her
white
teeth
blaine
told
me
to
report
to
him
this
afternoon
and
i
meant
to
but
he
did
tell
me
to
talk
to
anyone
else
even
you
when
you
asked
me
to
undertake
this
for
you
you
said
i
was
to
do
just
what
blaine
directed
and
i
tried
to
it
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
tell
you
but
i
thought
i
better
not
at
least
until
i
had
seen
blaine
i
was
sure
that
if
i
said
anything
to
you
about
it
you
would
let
carlis
see
your
resentment
the
next
time
he
called
and
then
he
and
old
mallowe
would
get
their
heads
together
and
find
out
that
their
suspicions
of
all
of
us
girls
were
correct
you
want
that
miss
murfree
is
quite
right
blaine
interposed
you
must
be
very
careful
miss
lawton
not
to
allow
carlis
to
discover
that
you
know
anything
whatever
of
that
conversation
at
least
just
yet
i
try
but
it
will
be
difficult
i
am
afraid
anita
murmured
i
am
not
accustomed
to
to
accepting
insults
ah
if
ramon
were
only
here
wilkes
the
butler
appeared
at
the
door
just
then
with
a
card
and
anita
read
it
aloud
mr
mallowe
oh
gracious
let
me
go
miss
lawton
exclaimed
loretta
i
told
you
everything
that
i
can
think
of
and
if
he
sees
me
it
will
spoil
blaine
plans
maybe
yes
he
must
not
find
you
here
the
detective
agreed
hurriedly
i
communicate
with
you
at
the
club
if
i
need
you
again
miss
murfree
you
have
been
of
great
service
to
both
miss
lawton
and
myself
when
they
were
alone
for
the
moment
before
the
president
appeared
blaine
turned
to
anita
you
will
try
to
be
very
courageous
and
follow
whatever
lead
i
give
you
he
asked
this
interview
may
prove
trying
for
you
anita
had
only
time
to
nod
before
mallowe
stood
before
them
he
paused
for
a
moment
glanced
inquiringly
at
blaine
and
then
advanced
to
anita
with
outstretched
hand
if
he
had
ever
seen
the
detective
before
he
gave
no
sign
my
dear
child
he
murmured
unctuously
i
trust
you
are
feeling
a
little
stronger
this
afternoon
a
little
brighter
and
more
hopeful
very
much
more
hopeful
thank
you
mallowe
returned
the
young
girl
steadily
i
have
enlisted
in
my
cause
the
greatest
of
all
investigators
allow
me
to
present
henry
blaine
blaine
mallowe
repeated
bowing
with
supercilious
urbanity
do
i
understand
that
this
is
the
private
detective
of
whom
i
have
heard
so
much
blaine
returned
his
salutation
coolly
but
did
not
speak
and
anita
replied
for
him
yes
mallowe
blaine
is
going
to
find
ramon
for
me
mallowe
shook
his
head
slowly
with
a
mournful
smile
ah
my
dear
he
sighed
i
do
not
want
to
dampen
your
hopes
heaven
knows
but
i
very
much
fear
that
that
will
be
an
impossible
task
even
for
one
of
blaine
unquestioned
renown
still
it
is
always
possible
to
try
the
detective
returned
looking
levelly
into
mallowe
eyes
personally
i
am
very
sanguine
of
success
everything
is
being
done
that
can
be
of
any
use
now
the
other
man
observed
hurriedly
do
i
understand
blaine
that
miss
lawton
has
definitely
retained
you
on
this
case
blaine
nodded
and
mallowe
turned
to
anita
really
my
dear
you
should
have
consulted
me
or
some
other
of
your
father
old
friends
before
taking
such
a
step
he
expostulated
it
will
only
bring
added
notoriety
and
trouble
to
you
i
do
not
mean
to
underestimate
blaine
marvelous
ability
which
is
recognized
everywhere
but
even
he
can
scarcely
succeed
in
locating
hamilton
where
we
with
all
the
resources
at
our
command
have
failed
mark
my
words
my
dear
anita
if
ramon
hamilton
returns
it
will
be
voluntarily
of
his
own
free
will
until
unless
he
so
decides
you
will
never
see
him
it
is
too
bad
to
have
summoned
blaine
here
on
a
useless
errand
but
i
am
sure
he
quite
understands
the
situation
now
i
do
responded
the
detective
quietly
i
have
accepted
the
case
but
surely
you
will
withdraw
the
older
man
voice
rose
cholerically
miss
lawton
is
a
mere
girl
a
minor
in
fact
i
am
over
eighteen
mallowe
interposed
anita
quietly
until
your
proper
guardian
is
appointed
by
the
courts
mallowe
cried
you
are
nominally
under
my
care
mine
and
others
of
your
father
closest
associates
this
is
a
delicate
matter
to
discuss
now
blaine
he
added
in
calmer
tones
turning
to
the
detective
but
since
this
seems
to
be
a
business
interview
we
must
touch
upon
the
question
of
finances
i
know
that
the
fee
you
naturally
require
must
be
a
large
one
and
i
am
in
duty
bound
to
tell
you
that
miss
lawton
has
absolutely
no
funds
at
her
disposal
to
reimburse
you
for
your
time
and
trouble
whatever
fortune
she
may
be
possessed
of
she
can
not
touch
now
miss
lawton
has
already
fully
reimbursed
me
in
advance
returned
henry
blaine
calmly
that
question
need
cause
you
no
further
concern
mallowe
nor
need
you
have
any
doubt
as
to
my
position
in
this
matter
i
on
this
case
and
i
on
it
to
stay
i
going
to
find
ramon
hamilton
chapter
xvi
the
library
chair
paddington
on
the
run
ross
the
operative
announced
to
henry
blaine
the
next
morning
jubilantly
he
left
his
rooms
about
an
hour
after
i
got
back
on
the
job
and
went
to
carlis
office
he
only
stayed
a
short
time
and
came
out
looking
as
black
as
a
i
guess
the
interview
whatever
it
was
did
go
his
way
he
went
straight
from
there
to
rockamore
the
promoter
i
pretended
an
errand
with
rockamore
too
and
so
got
into
the
outer
office
the
heavy
glass
door
was
closed
between
and
i
could
hear
anything
but
a
muffled
growling
from
within
but
they
were
both
angry
enough
all
right
once
the
stenographer
went
in
and
came
out
again
almost
immediately
when
the
door
opened
to
admit
her
i
heard
paddington
fairly
shout
your
own
skin
you
saving
you
fool
as
well
as
mine
if
caught
you
all
go
carlis
thinks
he
can
bluff
it
and
mallowe
a
superannuated
old
goat
he
try
to
stand
on
his
reputation
and
cave
in
like
a
pricked
balloon
when
the
crash
comes
i
know
his
kind
i
hounded
too
many
of
to
the
finish
but
a
man
of
sense
rockamore
and
you
know
you
got
to
help
me
out
of
this
for
your
own
sake
i
tell
you
some
one
on
to
the
whole
game
and
they
just
sitting
back
and
waiting
for
the
right
moment
to
nab
us
they
not
only
learn
every
move
we
make
they
anticipate
them
every
man
for
himself
now
and
i
warn
you
that
if
i
cornered
in
this
your
tongue
rockamore
ordered
you
see
then
the
door
closed
and
i
could
hear
any
more
the
voices
calmed
down
to
a
rumble
and
in
about
twenty
minutes
i
could
hear
them
approaching
the
door
i
decided
i
could
wait
any
longer
and
got
outside
just
in
time
to
give
paddington
a
chance
to
pass
me
he
seemed
in
good
humor
and
i
guess
he
got
what
he
was
after
money
probably
for
he
went
to
his
bank
and
put
through
a
check
then
he
returned
to
his
rooms
and
did
show
up
again
until
late
afternoon
when
he
went
away
up
belleair
avenue
to
the
rectory
of
the
church
of
james
he
did
go
in
just
talked
with
the
sexton
in
the
vestibule
and
when
he
came
down
the
steps
he
looked
dazed
as
if
he
received
a
hard
jolt
of
some
sort
he
could
have
been
trying
to
blackmail
the
minister
too
could
he
hardly
ross
go
on
blaine
responded
what
did
he
do
next
nothing
just
went
back
to
his
rooms
and
stayed
there
it
seemed
as
if
he
was
afraid
to
leave
not
so
much
afraid
to
be
found
but
as
if
he
might
miss
something
if
he
left
he
even
had
his
dinner
sent
in
from
a
restaurant
near
there
knowing
him
i
might
have
known
what
it
was
he
was
waiting
for
he
always
chasing
after
some
girl
or
other
there
was
a
woman
in
it
then
asked
the
detective
quietly
you
can
bet
there
was
very
much
in
it
sir
the
operative
chuckled
she
came
along
while
i
watched
a
tall
slim
girl
plainly
dressed
in
dark
clothes
but
with
an
air
to
her
that
would
make
you
look
at
her
twice
anywhere
she
hesitated
and
looked
uncertainly
about
her
as
if
she
were
unfamiliar
with
the
place
and
a
little
scary
of
her
errand
but
at
last
she
made
up
her
mind
and
plunged
in
the
vestibule
as
if
she
was
afraid
she
would
lose
her
courage
if
she
stopped
to
think
for
a
few
minutes
her
shadow
showed
on
the
beside
paddington
they
stood
close
together
and
from
their
gestures
he
seemed
to
be
arguing
or
pleading
while
she
was
drawing
back
and
refusing
or
at
least
holding
out
against
him
at
last
they
fell
into
a
regular
clinch
it
was
as
good
as
a
movie
after
a
moment
she
drew
herself
out
of
his
arms
and
they
moved
away
from
the
window
in
a
minute
or
two
they
came
out
of
the
house
together
and
i
tailed
them
they
walked
slowly
with
their
heads
very
close
and
i
dare
get
near
enough
to
try
to
hear
what
they
were
discussing
so
earnestly
but
where
do
you
suppose
he
took
her
to
the
anita
lawton
club
for
working
girls
he
left
her
at
the
entrance
and
went
back
to
his
own
rooms
and
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
queer
mood
all
the
way
happy
and
up
in
the
air
one
minute
and
down
in
the
dumps
the
next
he
did
stir
out
again
last
night
but
early
this
morning
he
went
down
to
the
office
of
the
line
and
purchased
two
tickets
to
rotterdam
on
the
sailing
next
saturday
so
i
think
we
have
the
straight
dope
on
him
now
he
means
to
skip
with
the
girl
saturday
two
days
off
mused
blaine
i
think
it
safe
to
give
him
his
head
until
then
but
keep
a
close
watch
on
him
ross
the
purchase
of
those
tickets
may
have
been
just
a
subterfuge
on
his
part
to
throw
any
possible
shadow
off
the
trail
did
you
ascertain
what
name
he
took
them
under
padelford
and
wife
clever
of
him
that
blaine
commented
if
he
really
intends
to
fool
this
girl
with
a
fake
marriage
and
sail
with
her
for
the
other
side
he
can
explain
the
change
of
names
on
the
steamer
to
her
by
telling
her
it
was
a
mistake
on
the
printed
once
at
sea
without
a
chance
of
escape
from
him
he
can
tell
her
the
truth
or
as
much
of
it
as
he
cares
to
and
she
have
to
stick
that
type
of
woman
always
does
she
might
even
come
in
time
to
take
up
his
line
and
become
a
cleverer
crook
than
he
is
but
we
not
going
to
let
that
happen
we
stop
him
right
enough
before
he
goes
too
far
with
her
he
doing
now
walking
in
the
park
with
her
she
met
him
at
the
gates
and
vanner
took
the
job
there
of
tailing
them
while
i
came
on
down
to
report
to
you
good
work
ross
but
go
back
and
take
up
the
trail
now
yourself
if
you
fit
and
here
you
better
take
this
warrant
with
you
i
swore
it
out
against
him
several
days
ago
in
case
he
attempted
to
bolt
if
he
tries
to
get
the
girl
into
a
compromising
situation
arrest
him
let
me
know
if
anything
of
importance
occurs
meanwhile
as
ross
went
out
the
secretary
marsh
appeared
there
an
elderly
gentleman
outside
waiting
to
see
you
sir
he
announced
he
does
not
wish
to
give
his
name
but
says
that
he
is
a
physician
and
is
here
in
answer
to
a
letter
which
he
received
from
you
good
they
pulled
it
off
then
we
were
only
just
in
time
with
those
letters
we
sent
out
yesterday
marsh
show
him
in
at
once
in
a
few
moments
a
tall
spare
figure
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
paused
an
instant
before
entering
he
had
a
keen
ascetic
face
topped
with
a
mass
of
hair
come
in
doctor
invited
the
detective
i
am
henry
blaine
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
in
response
to
my
letter
i
take
it
that
you
have
something
interesting
to
tell
me
the
doctor
entered
and
seated
himself
in
the
chair
indicated
by
blaine
he
carried
with
him
a
worn
black
leather
instrument
case
i
do
not
know
whether
what
i
have
to
tell
you
will
prove
to
have
any
connection
with
the
matter
you
referred
to
in
your
letter
or
not
blaine
indeed
i
hesitated
about
divulging
my
experience
of
last
night
to
you
the
ethics
of
my
profession
my
profession
has
ethics
too
doctor
although
you
may
not
have
conceived
it
the
detective
reminded
him
quietly
even
more
than
doctor
or
priest
a
professional
investigator
must
preserve
inviolate
the
secrets
which
are
imparted
to
him
whether
they
take
the
form
of
a
light
under
a
bushel
or
a
skeleton
in
a
closet
in
the
cause
of
justice
only
may
he
open
his
lips
i
hold
safely
locked
away
in
my
mind
the
keys
to
mysteries
which
were
they
laid
bare
would
disrupt
society
drag
great
statesmen
from
their
pedestals
provoke
international
complications
even
bring
on
wars
if
you
know
anything
pertaining
to
the
matter
of
which
i
wrote
you
justice
and
the
ethics
of
your
profession
require
you
to
speak
i
agree
with
you
sir
as
i
said
i
am
not
certain
that
my
adventure
for
it
was
quite
an
adventure
for
a
retired
man
like
myself
i
assure
you
has
anything
to
do
with
the
case
you
are
investigating
but
we
can
soon
establish
that
do
you
recognize
the
subject
of
this
photograph
the
doctor
drew
from
his
pocket
a
small
square
bit
of
cardboard
and
blaine
took
it
eagerly
from
him
one
glance
at
it
was
sufficient
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
detective
restrained
the
exclamation
of
triumph
which
rose
to
his
lips
upon
the
card
was
mounted
a
tiny
thumbnail
photograph
of
a
face
the
face
of
ramon
hamilton
it
was
more
like
a
than
a
living
countenance
with
its
rigid
features
and
closed
eyes
but
the
likeness
was
indisputable
i
recognize
it
indeed
doctor
that
is
the
man
for
whom
i
am
searching
how
did
it
come
into
your
possession
i
took
it
myself
last
night
the
spare
figure
of
the
elderly
physician
straightened
proudly
in
his
chair
when
your
communication
arrived
i
did
not
attach
much
importance
to
it
because
it
did
not
occur
to
me
for
a
moment
that
i
should
have
been
selected
from
among
all
the
physicians
and
surgeons
of
this
city
for
such
a
case
when
the
summons
came
however
i
remembered
your
warning
but
i
anticipate
since
my
patient
of
last
night
is
your
subject
i
may
as
well
tell
you
my
experiences
from
the
beginning
my
name
is
alwyn
doctor
horatius
alwyn
and
i
live
at
number
maple
avenue
until
my
retirement
seven
years
ago
i
was
a
regular
practising
physician
and
surgeon
but
since
my
i
suffered
a
slight
stroke
i
have
devoted
myself
to
my
books
and
my
camera
always
a
hobby
with
me
well
late
last
night
the
front
rang
it
was
a
little
after
eleven
and
my
wife
and
the
maid
had
retired
but
i
was
developing
some
plates
in
the
and
opened
the
door
myself
three
men
stood
there
but
i
could
see
scarcely
anything
of
their
faces
for
the
collars
of
their
shaggy
motor
coats
were
turned
up
their
caps
pulled
low
over
their
eyes
and
all
three
wore
goggles
alwyn
asked
one
of
the
men
the
burliest
of
the
three
advancing
into
the
hall
want
you
to
come
out
into
the
country
with
me
on
a
hurry
call
it
a
matter
of
life
and
death
and
there
five
thousand
dollars
in
it
for
you
but
the
conditions
attached
to
it
are
somewhat
unusual
may
we
come
into
your
office
and
talk
it
over
i
led
the
way
and
listened
to
their
proposition
briefly
it
was
this
a
young
man
had
fallen
and
injured
his
head
and
was
lying
unconscious
in
a
sanitarium
in
the
suburbs
there
were
reasons
which
could
not
be
explained
to
me
why
the
utmost
secrecy
must
be
maintained
not
only
concerning
the
young
man
identity
but
the
location
of
the
retreat
where
he
was
in
seclusion
they
feared
that
he
had
suffered
a
concussion
of
the
brain
possibly
a
fractured
skull
and
my
diagnosis
was
required
also
should
i
deem
an
operation
necessary
i
must
be
prepared
to
perform
it
at
once
they
would
take
me
to
the
patient
in
the
car
but
when
we
reached
our
destination
i
was
to
be
blindfolded
and
led
to
the
sickroom
where
the
bandage
would
be
removed
from
my
eyes
i
was
to
return
in
the
same
manner
for
this
service
and
of
course
my
secrecy
they
offered
me
five
thousand
dollars
although
that
would
not
have
been
an
exorbitant
sum
for
me
to
obtain
for
such
an
operation
in
the
days
of
my
activities
it
looked
very
large
to
me
now
especially
since
some
south
american
securities
in
which
i
invested
had
declined
but
i
did
not
feel
that
it
would
be
compatible
with
my
dignity
and
standing
to
accept
the
conditions
which
were
imposed
i
was
therefore
upon
the
point
of
indignantly
declining
when
i
suddenly
remembered
your
letter
and
resolved
to
see
the
affair
through
it
occurred
to
me
while
i
was
selecting
the
instruments
to
take
with
me
that
it
would
not
be
a
bad
idea
to
take
also
my
latest
camera
and
if
possible
obtain
a
photograph
of
the
patient
to
show
you
i
managed
to
slip
it
into
my
vest
pocket
unobserved
by
my
visitors
here
it
is
alwyn
took
the
instrument
case
upon
his
knee
and
opening
it
produced
what
looked
like
a
large
watch
of
the
turnip
variety
the
doctor
extended
it
almost
apologetically
you
see
he
observed
it
is
really
more
a
toy
than
a
real
camera
although
it
served
admirably
last
night
i
have
had
a
great
deal
of
amusement
with
it
pretending
to
feel
people
pulses
but
in
reality
snapping
their
photographs
it
takes
very
small
imperfect
pictures
of
course
as
you
can
see
from
the
print
there
on
your
desk
and
only
one
to
each
loading
but
it
can
be
carried
in
the
palm
of
one
hand
and
it
uses
a
peculiarly
sensitive
plate
that
will
register
a
even
by
electric
light
it
had
fortunately
just
been
reloaded
before
the
advent
of
my
mysterious
visitors
and
i
resolved
to
make
use
of
it
if
an
opportunity
offered
the
curtains
were
tightly
drawn
in
the
car
and
as
the
interior
lights
had
been
extinguished
we
sat
in
total
darkness
i
could
not
of
course
tell
in
what
direction
we
were
going
although
the
car
had
been
pointed
south
when
we
left
my
door
we
appeared
to
be
travelling
at
a
terrific
rate
of
speed
and
swung
around
a
confusing
number
of
curves
i
tried
at
first
to
remember
the
turns
and
their
direction
but
there
were
so
many
that
i
very
soon
lost
count
i
think
they
took
me
in
a
way
purposely
to
confuse
me
i
have
no
idea
how
long
we
drove
but
it
must
have
been
well
over
two
hours
at
last
we
struck
a
long
and
one
of
my
companions
announced
that
we
were
almost
there
they
bound
my
eyes
with
a
dark
silk
handkerchief
and
a
moment
later
the
car
swerved
and
turned
abruptly
in
evidently
at
a
gateway
for
we
curved
about
up
a
graveled
driveway
i
could
hear
it
crunching
beneath
the
wheels
and
came
to
a
grinding
stop
before
the
door
they
helped
me
out
of
the
car
up
some
shallow
stone
steps
and
across
the
threshold
i
was
led
down
a
thickly
carpeted
hall
and
up
a
single
long
flight
of
stairs
to
a
door
just
at
its
head
we
entered
the
door
closed
softly
behind
us
and
the
bandage
was
whipped
from
my
eyes
there
was
only
a
low
burning
in
the
room
but
i
made
out
the
outlines
of
the
furniture
there
was
a
great
bed
over
in
the
corner
with
a
motionless
figure
lying
upon
it
your
patient
doc
go
ahead
my
burly
friend
said
and
accordingly
i
approached
the
bed
asking
at
the
same
time
for
more
light
the
young
man
was
unconscious
and
in
answer
to
a
question
of
mine
the
attendant
who
had
sat
at
the
head
of
the
bed
as
we
entered
informed
me
that
he
had
been
in
a
complete
state
of
coma
since
he
had
been
brought
there
several
days
before
i
remembered
the
description
in
your
letter
of
the
subject
for
whom
you
were
searching
and
i
fancied
in
spite
of
the
bandages
which
swathed
his
head
that
i
recognized
him
in
the
young
man
before
me
the
lights
flashed
on
full
in
answer
to
my
request
and
on
a
sudden
decision
i
drew
the
watch
camera
from
my
pocket
took
the
wrist
between
my
thumb
and
finger
as
if
to
ascertain
his
pulse
and
snapped
his
picture
the
result
was
a
fortunate
chance
for
i
did
not
dare
focus
deliberately
with
the
eyes
of
the
attendant
and
the
three
men
who
had
accompanied
me
all
directed
at
my
movements
then
i
gave
the
patient
a
thorough
examination
i
found
a
fracture
at
the
base
of
the
brain
not
necessarily
fatal
unless
cerebral
meningitis
sets
in
but
quite
serious
enough
he
was
still
bleeding
a
little
from
the
nose
and
ears
i
washed
them
out
and
packed
the
ears
with
sterile
gauze
leaving
instructions
that
a
specially
prepared
ice
cap
be
placed
at
once
upon
his
head
and
kept
there
that
was
all
which
could
be
done
at
that
time
but
the
patient
should
have
constant
watchful
attention
he
must
either
have
suffered
a
severe
backward
fall
or
received
a
violent
blow
at
the
base
of
the
skull
to
have
sustained
such
an
injury
when
i
had
finished
they
blindfolded
me
again
led
me
from
the
room
and
conveyed
me
home
in
the
same
manner
in
which
i
had
come
with
the
possible
exception
that
the
car
in
returning
seemed
to
take
a
different
and
more
direct
route
the
journey
appeared
to
be
a
much
shorter
one
with
fewer
twists
and
turns
the
same
three
men
came
back
to
the
house
with
me
and
entered
my
office
where
the
burly
one
turned
over
to
me
ten
bills
they
left
almost
immediately
and
although
it
was
close
on
to
dawn
i
went
into
my
dark
room
and
developed
the
negative
of
the
thumbnail
photograph
i
had
taken
the
events
of
the
night
had
been
so
extraordinary
that
when
i
did
retire
it
was
long
before
i
could
sleep
in
the
morning
i
made
a
couple
of
prints
from
the
negative
then
took
the
five
thousand
dollars
down
and
deposited
it
to
my
account
in
the
bank
when
i
decided
to
come
here
i
ran
over
in
my
mind
every
moment
of
the
previous
night
adventure
to
catalogue
my
impressions
the
habit
of
years
has
made
me
methodical
in
all
things
and
i
jotted
them
down
in
the
order
in
which
they
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
not
forget
to
relate
them
to
you
memory
plays
one
sad
tricks
sometimes
when
one
reaches
my
age
these
notes
may
be
of
no
assistance
to
you
sir
but
they
are
entirely
at
your
service
i
am
eager
to
hear
them
doctor
i
only
wish
all
witnesses
were
like
you
my
tasks
would
be
lightened
by
half
blaine
said
heartily
the
elderly
physician
drew
from
his
pocket
a
paper
at
which
he
peered
painstakingly
i
have
numbered
them
let
me
see
oh
yes
first
the
burly
man
walks
with
a
slight
limp
in
the
right
leg
second
of
the
two
men
with
him
all
i
could
note
was
that
one
spoke
with
a
decided
french
accent
and
had
a
hollow
cough
tuberculous
i
think
the
other
who
scarcely
uttered
a
word
was
short
and
stocky
and
of
enormous
strength
he
fairly
lifted
me
into
and
out
of
the
car
when
i
was
blindfolded
at
the
entrance
of
the
place
they
called
a
sanitarium
third
the
car
had
a
peculiar
horn
i
have
never
heard
one
like
it
before
its
blast
was
sharp
and
wailing
not
like
a
siren
but
more
like
the
howl
of
a
wounded
animal
i
would
know
it
again
anywhere
fourth
there
is
a
railroad
bridge
very
near
the
house
to
which
i
was
taken
i
distinctly
heard
two
trains
thunder
over
the
trestles
while
i
was
attending
my
patient
fifth
i
should
judge
the
place
to
be
more
of
a
retreat
for
alcoholics
or
the
insane
than
for
those
suffering
from
accident
or
any
form
of
physical
injury
a
patient
in
some
remote
part
of
the
house
was
undoubtedly
a
maniac
or
in
the
throes
of
an
attack
of
delirium
tremens
i
heard
his
cries
at
intervals
as
i
worked
until
he
quieted
down
finally
sixth
the
bedroom
where
my
patient
is
lying
is
on
the
second
floor
the
windows
facing
south
and
east
there
was
a
moon
last
night
and
one
of
the
curtains
was
partly
raised
his
door
is
just
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
on
your
right
as
you
go
up
and
the
stairs
are
on
a
straight
line
with
the
front
door
therefore
the
house
faces
south
seventh
when
we
returned
to
my
home
and
were
in
my
office
the
burly
man
had
to
pull
the
glove
off
his
right
hand
to
get
the
wallet
from
his
pocket
in
order
to
pay
me
my
fee
and
i
saw
that
two
fingers
were
missing
they
had
both
been
amputated
at
the
middle
joint
also
when
they
were
leaving
i
heard
the
man
who
spoke
with
an
accent
address
him
as
mac
it
mac
alarney
by
the
lord
blaine
started
from
his
chair
why
did
i
not
think
of
him
before
doctor
you
have
rendered
to
me
and
to
my
client
an
invaluable
service
which
shall
not
be
forgotten
mac
alarney
is
a
retired
in
close
touch
with
all
the
political
crooks
and
grafters
in
the
city
he
runs
a
sort
of
retreat
for
alcoholics
up
near
green
valley
and
bears
a
generally
shady
reputation
are
you
game
to
go
back
with
me
for
another
call
on
your
patient
you
will
be
well
guarded
and
in
no
possible
danger
now
or
for
the
future
i
give
you
my
word
for
that
i
may
need
you
to
verify
some
facts
the
doctor
hesitated
visibly
i
am
not
afraid
he
replied
at
last
but
i
scarcely
feel
that
it
is
conformable
with
the
ethics
of
my
calling
i
was
called
in
in
my
professional
capacity
my
dear
doctor
the
detective
interrupted
him
with
a
trace
of
impatience
in
his
tones
your
patient
is
one
of
the
most
widely
known
young
men
of
this
city
he
was
kidnaped
and
the
police
have
been
searching
for
him
for
days
the
press
of
the
entire
country
has
rung
with
the
story
of
his
mysterious
disappearance
he
is
ramon
hamilton
good
heavens
can
it
be
possible
the
physician
exclaimed
i
assure
you
sir
i
had
no
idea
of
his
identity
he
was
to
have
married
pennington
lawton
daughter
was
he
not
i
have
read
of
his
disappearance
of
course
the
newspapers
have
been
full
of
it
and
he
was
kidnaped
you
say
no
wonder
those
ruffians
maintained
such
secrecy
in
regard
to
their
destination
last
night
blaine
i
will
accompany
you
sir
and
give
you
any
aid
in
my
power
in
rescuing
mr
hamilton
good
i
make
all
the
necessary
arrangements
and
call
for
you
at
eight
meanwhile
keep
a
strict
guard
upon
your
tongue
and
say
nothing
to
anyone
of
what
has
occurred
have
you
told
your
wife
of
your
adventure
no
blaine
i
merely
told
her
i
was
out
on
a
sudden
night
call
i
decided
to
wait
until
i
had
seen
you
before
mentioning
the
extraordinary
features
of
the
case
you
are
a
man
of
discretion
doctor
until
eight
then
you
may
expect
me
without
fail
doctor
alwyn
left
and
blaine
spent
a
busy
making
his
arrangements
for
the
night
raid
scarcely
had
he
completed
them
when
the
telephone
shrilled
the
detective
did
not
at
first
recognize
the
voice
which
came
to
him
over
the
wire
so
changed
was
it
so
fraught
with
horror
and
a
menace
of
tragedy
it
is
you
miss
lawton
he
asked
half
unbelievingly
what
is
the
matter
what
has
happened
i
must
see
you
at
once
blaine
i
have
made
a
discovery
so
unexpected
so
terrible
that
i
am
afraid
to
be
alone
i
am
afraid
of
my
own
thoughts
please
please
come
immediately
i
will
be
with
you
as
soon
as
my
car
can
reach
your
door
he
replied
what
could
the
young
girl
have
discovered
shut
up
there
in
that
great
lonely
house
what
new
developments
could
have
arisen
in
the
case
which
until
this
moment
had
seemed
plain
to
him
to
the
end
he
found
her
awaiting
him
in
the
hall
with
ashen
face
and
trembling
limbs
she
clutched
his
hand
with
her
small
icy
one
and
whispered
come
into
the
library
blaine
i
have
something
to
tell
you
to
show
you
he
followed
her
into
the
huge
somber
silent
room
where
only
a
few
short
weeks
ago
her
father
had
met
with
his
death
coming
from
the
brilliant
sunshine
without
it
was
a
moment
or
two
before
his
eyes
could
penetrate
the
gloom
when
they
did
so
he
saw
the
great
leather
chair
by
the
hearth
which
had
played
so
important
a
part
in
the
tragedy
had
been
overturned
blaine
the
girl
faced
him
her
voice
steadied
and
deepened
portentously
my
father
died
of
did
he
not
the
detective
felt
a
sudden
thrill
almost
of
premonition
at
her
unexpected
question
but
he
controlled
himself
and
replied
quietly
that
was
the
diagnosis
of
the
physician
and
the
coroner
findings
corroborated
him
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
there
might
be
another
and
more
terrible
explanation
of
his
sudden
death
a
detective
must
consider
and
analyze
a
case
from
every
standpoint
you
know
miss
lawton
he
answered
it
did
occur
to
me
that
perhaps
your
father
met
with
foul
play
but
i
put
the
theory
from
me
for
lack
of
evidence
blaine
my
father
was
murdered
murdered
how
do
you
know
what
have
you
discovered
he
was
given
poison
i
have
found
the
bottle
which
contained
it
hidden
deep
in
the
folds
of
his
chair
there
it
was
no
morbid
fancy
of
mine
after
all
my
instinct
was
right
no
wonder
that
chair
has
exerted
such
a
horrible
fascination
for
me
ever
since
my
poor
father
died
in
it
see
with
indescribable
loathing
she
extended
her
left
hand
which
until
now
she
had
held
clenched
behind
her
upon
the
palm
lay
a
tiny
flat
vial
with
a
pale
substance
dried
in
the
bottom
of
it
blaine
took
it
and
drew
the
cork
before
he
had
time
to
place
it
at
his
nostrils
a
faint
but
unmistakable
odor
of
bitter
almonds
floated
out
upon
the
air
and
pervaded
the
room
prussic
acid
he
exclaimed
it
has
the
same
outward
effect
as
an
attack
of
would
produce
to
a
superficial
examination
miss
lawton
how
did
you
discover
this
by
the
merest
accident
i
have
a
habit
of
creeping
in
here
when
i
am
more
deeply
despondent
than
usual
and
sitting
for
a
while
in
my
father
chair
it
calms
and
comforts
me
almost
as
if
he
were
with
me
once
more
i
was
sitting
there
just
before
i
telephoned
you
thinking
over
all
that
had
occurred
in
these
last
weeks
when
i
broke
down
and
cried
i
felt
for
my
handkerchief
but
could
not
find
it
and
thinking
that
i
might
perhaps
have
dropped
it
in
the
chair
i
ran
my
hand
down
deep
in
the
leather
fold
between
the
seat
and
the
side
and
back
my
fingers
encountered
something
flat
and
hard
which
had
been
jammed
away
down
inside
and
i
dug
it
out
it
was
this
bottle
blaine
does
it
mean
that
my
father
was
murdered
by
that
man
whose
voice
i
heard
that
man
who
came
to
him
in
the
night
and
threatened
him
i
afraid
it
does
miss
lawton
henry
blaine
said
slowly
when
you
hear
that
voice
again
and
recognize
it
we
shall
be
able
to
lay
our
hands
upon
the
murderer
of
your
father
chapter
xvii
the
rescue
precisely
at
the
hour
of
eight
that
night
a
huge
limousine
drew
up
at
the
gate
of
number
maple
avenue
down
the
block
well
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
which
gave
to
the
avenue
its
name
two
more
cars
and
a
motor
ambulance
had
halted
doctor
alwyn
who
had
been
excitedly
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
detective
was
out
of
his
door
and
down
the
path
almost
before
the
car
had
pulled
up
at
his
gate
within
it
were
three
men
blaine
himself
and
two
others
whom
the
doctor
did
not
know
henry
blaine
greeted
him
introduced
his
operatives
ross
and
suraci
and
they
started
swiftly
upon
their
journey
the
doctor
was
plainly
nervous
but
something
in
the
grim
silent
determined
air
of
his
companions
imparted
itself
to
him
the
lights
in
the
interior
of
the
car
had
not
been
turned
on
nor
the
shades
lowered
and
after
a
few
tentative
remarks
which
were
not
encouraged
doctor
alwyn
turned
to
the
window
and
watched
the
brightly
lighted
cross
streets
dart
by
with
speed
once
he
glanced
back
and
started
casting
a
perturbed
glance
at
the
immovable
face
of
the
detective
as
he
remarked
blaine
are
you
aware
that
we
are
being
followed
oh
yes
give
yourself
no
uneasiness
on
that
score
doctor
they
are
two
of
my
machines
filled
with
my
men
and
a
walton
ambulance
for
hamilton
we
will
reach
mac
alarney
retreat
in
an
hour
now
there
will
be
a
show
of
trouble
of
course
and
we
may
have
to
use
force
but
i
do
not
anticipate
any
very
strenuous
opposition
to
our
removal
of
your
patient
when
mac
is
convinced
that
the
game
is
up
no
harm
will
come
to
you
at
any
rate
you
will
be
well
guarded
the
doctor
drew
himself
up
with
simple
dignity
quite
free
from
bombast
or
arrogance
i
am
not
afraid
he
replied
quietly
i
am
armed
and
am
fully
prepared
to
help
protect
my
patient
armed
the
detective
asked
sharply
for
answer
doctor
alwyn
drew
from
his
capacious
coat
pocket
a
huge
pistol
and
held
it
out
to
blaine
the
latter
took
it
from
him
without
ceremony
a
grave
mistake
doctor
i
am
glad
you
told
me
in
time
are
unnecessary
for
your
own
protection
and
would
be
a
positive
menace
to
our
plans
for
getting
your
patient
safely
away
is
the
last
thing
we
must
think
of
my
men
will
attend
to
all
that
if
it
comes
to
a
the
doctor
watched
him
in
silence
as
he
slipped
the
pistol
under
one
of
the
side
seats
if
his
confidence
in
the
great
man
beside
him
faltered
for
the
moment
he
gave
no
sign
but
turned
his
attention
again
to
the
window
they
were
now
rapidly
traversing
the
suburbs
where
the
houses
were
widely
separated
by
stretches
of
vacant
lots
and
the
streets
deserted
and
but
dimly
lighted
soon
they
rattled
over
a
narrow
railroad
bridge
and
doctor
alwyn
exclaimed
by
george
this
is
the
way
we
went
last
night
with
all
my
careful
thought
i
forgot
about
that
bridge
until
this
moment
minutes
passed
long
minutes
which
seemed
like
hours
to
the
overstrained
nerves
of
the
doctor
while
they
speeded
through
the
open
country
all
at
once
from
just
behind
them
came
a
hideous
wailing
cry
which
swelled
in
volume
to
a
screech
and
ended
abruptly
doctor
alwyn
grasped
blaine
arm
the
he
gasped
the
car
i
was
in
last
night
the
detective
nodded
shortly
without
speaking
and
leaning
forward
stared
fixedly
out
of
the
window
a
long
limousine
appeared
creeping
slowly
up
inch
by
inch
until
it
was
fairly
abreast
of
them
the
curtain
at
the
window
was
lowered
and
the
chauffeur
sat
immovable
with
his
face
turned
from
them
as
the
two
cars
whirled
side
by
side
along
the
hard
glistening
road
blaine
leaned
forward
and
pressed
the
electric
bell
rapidly
twice
and
there
began
a
curious
game
the
other
car
put
on
extra
speed
and
darted
ahead
their
own
shot
forward
and
kept
abreast
of
it
it
slowed
suddenly
and
made
as
if
to
swerve
in
behind
blaine
driver
slowed
also
until
both
cars
almost
came
to
a
grinding
halt
three
times
these
maneuvers
were
repeated
and
then
there
occurred
what
the
detective
had
evidently
anticipated
the
curtain
in
the
other
car
shot
up
the
window
descended
with
a
bang
and
a
huge
burly
figure
leaned
out
henry
blaine
noiselessly
lowered
their
own
window
and
suddenly
flashed
an
electric
pocket
light
full
in
the
face
empurpled
with
inarticulate
rage
is
that
your
man
he
asked
quickly
the
one
with
the
three
fingers
yes
that
the
man
whispered
the
doctor
hoarsely
that
mac
alarney
blaine
pressed
the
electric
bell
again
and
their
own
car
lunged
forward
in
a
spurt
of
speed
which
left
the
other
hopelessly
behind
although
it
was
manifestly
making
desperate
efforts
to
overtake
and
pass
them
do
you
suppose
he
suspected
our
errand
the
doctor
asked
suspected
lord
bless
you
man
he
knows
he
had
already
passed
the
two
open
cars
full
of
my
men
and
the
ambulance
he
give
ten
years
of
his
life
to
beat
us
out
and
reach
his
place
ahead
of
us
but
he
has
a
chance
in
the
world
unless
we
blow
out
a
tire
and
if
we
do
we
all
go
back
in
the
ambulance
together
what
left
of
us
even
as
he
spoke
there
came
a
swift
change
in
the
even
drone
of
their
engine
a
jarring
discordant
note
slight
but
unmistakable
and
a
series
of
irregular
thudding
knocks
one
of
the
cylinder
missing
sir
ross
turned
to
the
detective
and
spoke
with
eager
anxiety
we
make
it
on
five
the
quiet
confidence
in
blaine
voice
with
its
underlying
note
of
grim
indomitable
determination
seemed
to
communicate
itself
to
the
other
men
and
no
further
word
was
said
although
they
all
heard
the
thunder
of
the
approaching
car
behind
the
doctor
restrained
with
difficulty
the
impulse
to
look
backward
and
instead
kept
his
eyes
sternly
fixed
upon
the
trees
and
flying
past
more
sharply
defined
shadows
in
the
lesser
dark
then
all
at
once
the
shriek
of
a
locomotive
burst
upon
his
ears
and
the
roar
and
rattle
of
a
train
going
over
a
trestle
the
railroad
bridge
he
cried
excitedly
we
there
mr
blaine
the
noise
of
the
passing
train
had
scarcely
died
away
when
from
just
behind
them
the
hideous
shriek
of
mac
alarney
rose
blastingly
three
times
upon
the
night
air
the
last
fainter
than
the
others
as
if
the
pursuing
car
had
dropped
back
he
beaten
he
could
keep
up
the
pace
much
less
better
it
blaine
remarked
those
three
blasts
sounded
a
warning
to
the
guards
of
the
retreat
it
was
probably
a
signal
agreed
upon
in
case
of
danger
we
in
for
it
now
they
swerved
abruptly
between
two
high
stone
gateposts
and
up
a
broad
sweep
of
graveled
driveway
lights
gleamed
suddenly
in
the
windows
of
the
hitherto
darkened
house
which
loomed
up
gaunt
and
squarely
defined
against
the
sullen
sky
your
men
in
the
other
cars
doctor
alwyn
stammered
as
they
came
to
a
crunching
stop
before
the
door
will
they
arrive
in
time
to
be
of
service
mac
alarney
will
reach
here
first
my
men
will
be
at
his
heels
returned
blaine
shortly
they
held
back
purposely
acting
under
my
instructions
come
on
now
he
sprang
from
the
car
and
up
the
steps
and
the
doctor
found
himself
following
with
ross
and
suraci
on
either
side
the
driver
turned
their
car
around
and
ran
it
upon
the
lawn
its
searchlight
trained
on
the
circling
drive
its
engine
throbbing
like
the
throat
of
an
impatient
horse
in
response
to
the
detective
vigorous
ring
the
door
was
opened
by
a
short
stocky
man
at
sight
of
whom
the
doctor
gave
a
start
of
surprise
but
did
not
falter
the
man
was
clad
in
the
white
coat
of
a
hospital
attendant
beneath
which
the
great
bunchy
muscles
of
his
shoulders
and
upper
arms
were
plainly
visible
hello
al
exclaimed
blaine
briskly
the
veins
on
the
thick
bull
neck
seemed
to
swell
but
there
was
no
sign
of
recognition
in
the
stolid
jaw
only
the
lower
lip
protruded
as
the
man
set
his
jaw
and
the
little
porcine
eyes
narrowed
you
were
a
rubber
at
the
hoffmeister
baths
the
last
time
i
saw
you
went
on
the
detective
smoothly
as
he
deftly
inserted
his
foot
between
the
door
and
jamb
you
remember
me
of
course
i
henry
blaine
my
friends
and
i
have
come
here
on
a
confidential
errand
and
i
like
a
word
in
private
with
you
the
man
he
called
al
muttered
something
which
sounded
like
a
disclaimer
then
he
caught
sight
of
the
doctor
face
over
shoulder
and
a
spasm
of
black
rage
seized
him
oh
it
you
is
it
you
snitched
d
n
you
i
do
for
you
for
this
he
lunged
forward
but
blaine
with
a
strength
of
which
the
doctor
would
not
a
moment
before
have
thought
him
possessed
grasped
the
and
flung
him
backward
advancing
into
the
hall
at
the
same
time
while
his
two
operatives
and
the
doctor
crowded
in
behind
him
al
staggered
regained
his
balance
and
came
on
in
a
blind
rush
bull
neck
lowered
long
arms
taut
and
rigid
for
the
first
blow
blaine
set
himself
to
meet
it
but
it
was
never
delivered
at
that
instant
the
whirring
roar
of
a
car
unmuffled
sounded
in
all
their
ears
and
a
second
machine
drew
up
at
the
steps
its
single
passenger
flung
himself
out
and
bounded
up
to
the
door
what
in
h
l
does
this
mean
he
bellowed
did
you
hear
my
horn
he
stopped
abruptly
in
sheer
amazement
for
blaine
had
turned
with
beaming
face
and
outstretched
hand
mac
alarney
he
exclaimed
thank
the
lord
you
come
this
boob
would
give
me
time
for
a
word
and
every
minute
is
precious
come
where
i
can
talk
to
you
quick
then
as
if
catching
sight
of
the
car
in
which
mac
alarney
had
come
for
the
first
time
his
eyes
widened
and
he
seemed
struggling
to
suppress
an
outburst
of
mirth
great
guns
is
that
car
yours
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
it
was
you
i
was
playing
with
back
there
on
the
road
when
i
flashed
the
light
in
your
face
i
was
sure
you
were
donnelley
as
he
uttered
the
name
of
the
chief
of
police
mac
alarney
involuntarily
stepped
backward
and
a
wave
of
startled
apprehension
swept
the
amazement
from
his
face
to
be
succeeded
in
turn
by
the
primitive
craftiness
of
the
brute
instinct
on
guard
and
what
may
you
be
wanting
here
mr
blaine
he
demanded
warily
to
beat
the
police
to
it
blaine
replied
in
a
gruff
whisper
adding
as
he
jerked
his
thumb
in
the
direction
of
the
waiting
al
get
rid
of
him
we
have
got
a
minute
i
tell
you
the
police
repeated
the
other
man
sharply
sure
i
passed
two
cars
full
of
bulls
with
an
ambulance
trailing
them
you
can
go
now
al
without
giving
the
burly
proprietor
of
the
retreat
time
to
discover
him
for
himself
blaine
pulled
the
astonished
doctor
forward
here
doctor
alwyn
whom
you
brought
here
last
night
the
police
trailed
you
and
got
his
number
but
fortunately
when
they
began
to
question
him
he
smelled
a
rat
in
the
whole
business
and
came
to
me
they
told
him
a
man
named
paddington
had
you
but
of
course
i
knew
that
was
all
rot
the
minute
i
doped
it
out
got
a
fortune
under
your
roof
this
minute
and
you
do
know
it
mac
that
the
best
joke
of
all
you
entertaining
an
angel
unawares
say
what
you
gettin
at
mr
blaine
mac
alarney
brows
drew
close
together
and
he
stared
levelly
from
beneath
them
at
the
detective
exultant
face
that
young
man
with
the
fractured
skull
in
the
corner
room
upstairs
the
one
you
brought
doctor
alwyn
to
attend
last
night
when
you
know
who
he
is
you
going
up
in
the
air
i
do
know
who
brought
him
here
or
what
line
of
talk
they
gave
you
but
it
a
wonder
you
have
guessed
from
the
start
who
he
was
with
the
papers
full
of
it
for
days
of
course
they
must
have
given
you
a
lot
of
money
to
get
him
well
and
hush
it
all
up
when
you
were
able
to
pay
the
doctor
here
five
thousand
dollars
but
whatever
they
paid
it
a
drop
in
the
bucket
compared
to
the
reward
they
expected
to
get
mac
it
ramon
hamilton
you
got
upstairs
blaine
stepped
back
himself
as
if
the
better
to
observe
the
effect
of
what
he
manifestly
seemed
to
believe
would
be
astounding
news
and
clumsily
and
cautiously
the
other
tried
to
play
up
to
his
lead
ramon
hamilton
he
echoed
you
crazy
blaine
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
you
better
believe
i
do
see
this
photograph
he
held
the
tiny
thumbnail
picture
before
mac
alarney
amazed
eyes
the
doctor
took
it
last
night
at
the
bedside
of
the
young
man
upstairs
when
you
thought
he
was
feeling
his
pulse
that
watch
of
his
was
in
reality
a
camera
with
a
roar
the
burly
man
turned
upon
the
erect
unshrinking
figure
of
the
doctor
but
blaine
halted
him
not
so
fast
mac
if
it
had
been
for
him
you
be
in
the
hands
of
the
police
now
remember
and
they
only
been
waiting
to
get
something
on
you
as
you
know
you
ca
blame
doctor
alwyn
for
being
suspicious
after
all
the
mysterious
fuss
you
made
bringing
him
here
i
know
ramon
hamilton
well
and
i
recognized
his
face
the
instant
it
was
handed
to
me
i
on
the
case
myself
miss
lawton
the
girl
going
to
marry
engaged
me
i
might
have
come
and
tried
to
take
him
away
from
you
so
as
to
cop
all
the
reward
myself
but
as
it
is
split
unless
the
police
get
here
while
we
wasting
time
talking
man
do
you
see
how
you
been
done
you
can
bet
your
life
i
do
that
is
if
the
young
man
i
got
upstairs
is
the
guy
you
think
he
is
he
added
in
an
afterthought
of
cautious
the
acid
of
the
hint
that
paddington
had
betrayed
him
to
the
police
had
burned
deep
however
as
blaine
had
anticipated
and
he
walked
blindly
into
the
snare
laid
for
him
tell
you
all
about
how
he
come
to
be
here
later
and
i
fix
them
that
tried
to
pull
the
wool
over
my
eyes
now
for
the
love
of
heaven
blaine
tell
me
what
to
do
with
him

outskirts
of

and
i
ordered

to

the
short

asked
mac
alarney
warily

talking
about

demanded
with
contemptuous
impatience

rest

we
go
straight
to
miss
lawton
deliver
the
goods
and
get
the

long
as

at
that

stick
to
the
truth
and
i
right
there
to
back
you
up
in
it
any
fool
could
realize
that
you
have
produced
him
and
claimed
the
reward
if
you
had
known
who
he
actually
was
whoever
brought
him
here

wrong
dope
and

car
and

out
henry
blaine
motioned
to
his
operatives
with
a
curt
wave
of
his
hand
to
follow
mac
alarney
and
turning
he
went
out
of
the
door
and
down
the
steps
to
his
car
with
the
doctor
at
his
heels
you
do
suppose
that
he
saw
through
your
story
do
you
mr
blaine
the
latter
queried
in
an
anxious
whisper
as
they
settled
themselves
to
wait
with
what
patience
they
could
muster
could
that
suggestion
of
his
have
been
merely
a
ruse
to
separate
your
assistants
from
you
the
detective
smiled
hardly
doctor
it
part
of
my
profession
to
have
made
a
study
of
human
nature
and
mac
alarney
type
is
an
open
book
to
me
added
to
that
i
known
the
man
himself
for
years
in
an
offhand
way
got
his
confidence
and
now
that
he
realizes
he
is
in
a
hole
he
a
child
in
my
hands
even
if
he
thinks
for
the
moment
that
as
a
detective
i
about
the
poorest
specimen
in
captivity
steady
now
here
they
come
the
large
double
doors
had
been
thrown
wide
open
and
mac
alarney
the
burly
al
and
the
two
operatives
appeared
bearing
between
them
a
limp
unconscious
form
as
they
eased
it
into
the
back
seat
of
the
limousine
blaine
flashed
his
electric
pocket
light
upon
the
sleeping
face
i
knew
i
was
mistaken
he
whispered
exultantly
to
mac
alarney
and
the
doctor
it
young
hamilton
all
right
now
let
be
off
the
others
crowded
in
and
they
whirled
down
the
drive
and
out
once
more
upon
the
wide
state
road
in
the
opposite
direction
to
that
in
which
they
had
come
a
bare
away
and
they
came
abruptly
upon
the
ambulance
screened
by
the
clump
of
naked
elms
at
the
side
of
the
road
you
get
in
first
doctor
ordered
blaine
significantly
you
got
to
look
after
your
patient
now
as
the
doctor
obeyed
mac
alarney
with
a
shrewd
gleam
in
his
eyes
turned
to
the
detective
i
think
i
better
ride
with
him
too
blaine
he
observed
you
do
know
who
you
can
trust
these
days
your
ambulance
driver
may
give
you
the
slip
all
right
mac
blaine
assented
with
bluff
heartiness
we
both
ride
with
him
did
you
think
i
try
to
you
too
i
blame
you
after
the
rotten
deal
that
been
handed
to
you
but
we
wo
waste
time
arguing
here
the
stretcher
come
on
shove
him
in
the
doctor
had
been
wondering
when
the
dénouement
of
this
adventure
would
be
now
it
came
without
warning
with
a
startling
suddenness
which
left
him
dazed
and
agape
the
inert
body
of
his
patient
was
laid
carefully
beside
him
and
he
glanced
out
of
the
ambulance
door
in
time
to
see
mac
alarney
dismiss
his
burly
assistant
and
turn
to
enter
the
vehicle
his
foot
was
already
upon
the
lowest
step
when
the
doctor
saw
blaine
raise
his
hand
to
his
lips
a
short
sharp
blast
of
a
whistle
pierced
the
air
and
in
an
instant
a
dozen
men
had
sprung
out
of
the
darkness
and
leaped
upon
the
two
surprised
miscreants
then
ensued
a
struggle
brief
but
awful
to
the
onlooker
in
its
silent
grim
ferocity
as
the
two
separate
knots
of
men
battled
each
about
their
central
orbit
the
scuffle
of
many
feet
on
the
road
the
mutter
of
curses
the
dull
thud
of
blows
the
hoarse
strangulated
breathing
of
men
fighting
against
odds
to
the
last
ounce
of
their
strength
came
to
the
doctor
startled
ears
in
a
confused
babel
of
sound
with
the
purring
drone
of
the
two
engines
as
an
undertone
a
minute
and
it
was
all
over
the
al
went
down
like
a
felled
ox
and
mac
alarney
wavered
under
an
avalanche
of
blows
and
crumpled
to
his
knees
handcuffed
and
securely
bound
the
two
were
bundled
into
blaine
waiting
car
paddington
never
me
groaned
mac
alarney
before
the
door
closed
upon
him
but
you
did
blaine
just
as
i
meant
to
get
him
i
get
you
i
fell
for
your
d
d
scheme
and
since
you
got
the
goods
on
me
i
suppose
i
go
up
but
god
help
you
when
i
come
out
i
can
wait
it
be
the
better
when
it
comes
but
the
others
queried
the
doctor
as
he
and
blaine
with
the
injured
man
between
them
settled
down
in
the
ambulance
for
the
slow
careful
journey
back
to
the
city
that
third
man
who
came
for
me
last
night
the
one
with
the
french
accent
and
the
cough
and
the
rest
who
are
in
this
kidnaping
plot
will

get
them
too
ross
and
suraci
are
enough
to
guard
mac
alarney
and
al
on
their
way
to
the
the
detective
responded
quietly

others

go
on
up
to
the
sanitarium
and
clean
the
place

louis

their
just
deserts

is
said
that

have
never
lost

case

doctor
remarked
i
shall
not
lose
this
one
blaine
spoke
with
quiet
confidence
unmixed
with
any
boastfulness
i
can
not
lose
there
is
too
much
at
stake
late
that
night
anita
lawton
was
awakened
from
a
tortured
feverish
dream
by
the
violent
ringing
of
the
telephone
bell
at
her
bedside
the
voice
of
henry
blaine
fraught
with
a
latent
tension
of
suppressed
elation
came
to
her
over
the
wire

lawton

minutes

floor
of

a
fever
of
mingled
hope
and
anxiety

of
hers

him
back
to
the
city
i
have
come
to
take
you
to
him
but
why
why
did
he
not
come
with
you
does
he
not
realize
what
i
have
suffered
that
every
moment
of
suspense
of
waiting
for
him
is
an
added
torture
he
realizes
nothing
blaine
hesitated
and
then
went
on
it
is
best
for
you
to
know
the
truth
at
once
hamilton
has
suffered
a
severe
injury
he
is
lying
almost
at
the
point
of
death
but
the
physicians
say
he
has
a
chance
a
good
chance
for
recovery
now
that
he
is
where
he
can
receive
expert
care
and
attention
how
he
came
by
his
shattered
skull
he
has
a
fracture
at
the
base
of
the
brain
we
shall
not
know
until
he
recovers
sufficient
consciousness
to
tell
us
at
present
he
is
in
a
state
of
coma
recognizing
no
one
nothing
that
goes
on
about
him
he
will
not
rouse
to
hear
your
voice
he
will
not
know
of
your
presence
but
i
thought
that
it
would
comfort
you
to
see
him
to
feel
that
everything
is
being
done
for
him
that
can
be
done
ah
yes
she
sobbed
take
me
to
him
blaine
thank
god
thank
god
that
you
have
found
him
just
to
look
upon
his
dear
face
again
to
touch
him
to
know
that
at
least
he
still
lives
he
must
not
die
now
he
can
not
die
the
god
who
has
permitted
you
to
restore
him
to
me
would
not
allow
that
take
me
to
him
so
it
was
that
a
few
short
minutes
later
henry
blaine
tasted
the
first
real
fruit
of
his
victory
as
he
stood
aside
in
the
quiet
hospital
room
and
with
dimmed
eyes
beheld
the
scene
before
him
the
wide
white
bed
the
silent
motionless
figure
upon
it
the
slender
kneeling
girl
only
that
and
the
echo
of
her
sob
of
love
and
gratitude
his
own
great
fatherly
heart
swelled
with
the
joy
of
work
well
done
of
the
happiness
he
had
brought
to
a
spirit
all
but
broken
and
a
sure
triumphant
premonition
that
the
struggle
still
before
him
would
be
crowned
with
victory

the
trap
you
are
ready
miss
lawton
nerves
steady
enough
for
the
ordeal
asked
blaine
the
following
morning
i
am
ready
anita
voice
was
firm
and
controlled
and
there
was
the
glint
of
a
challenge
in
her
eyes
a
wondrous
change
had
come
over
her
since
the
previous
day
with
the
rescue
of
the
man
she
loved
and
the
certainty
that
he
would
recover
all
the
latent
indomitable
courage
and
fighting
spirit
which
had
come
to
her
as
an
heritage
from
her
father
and
which
had
made
of
him
the
ruler
of
men
and
arbiter
of
events
which
he
had
been
arose
again
within
her
the
most
crushing
weight
upon
her
heart
had
been
lifted
hope
and
love
had
revivified
her
and
she
was
indeed
ready
to
face
the
world
again
to
meet
her
enemies
the
murderers
and
traducers
of
her
father
and
to
give
battle
to
them
on
their
own
ground
in
a
few
moments
a
man
will
enter
this
library
a
man
whom
you
know
well
you
will
be
stationed
behind
the
curtains
at
this
window
here
and
you
must
summon
all
your
to
restrain
yourself
from
giving
any
start
or
uttering
a
sound
of
surprise
which
would
betray
your
presence
while
i
talk
to
him
i
want
you
to
try
with
all
your
might
to
put
from
your
mind
the
fact
that
you
know
him
do
not
let
his
personality
influence
you
in
any
way
or
his
speech
only
listen
to
the
tones
of
his
voice
listen
and
try
to
recall
that
other
voice
which
you
heard
here
on
the
night
of
your
father
death
if
in
his
tones
you
recognize
that
voice
step
from
behind
those
curtains
and
face
him
if
not
and
you
must
be
absolutely
sure
that
you
do
recognize
the
voice
that
you
could
swear
to
it
under
oath
in
a
court
of
justice
realizing
that
it
will
probably
mean
swearing
away
a
life
if
you
are
not
sure
remain
silent
i
understand
blaine
i
will
not
fail
you
i
could
not
be
mistaken
the
voice
which
i
heard
here
that
night
rings
still
in
my
ears
its
echo
seems
yet
to
linger
in
the
room
her
gaze
wandered
to
the
great
leather
chair
which
had
been
replaced
in
its
usual
position
now
that
you
have
restored
ramon
to
me
i
want
only
to
avenge
my
father
and
i
shall
be
content
to
be
murdered
in
his
own
home
poisoned
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
i
shall
not
rest
until
the
coward
who
killed
him
has
been
brought
to
justice
he
will
be
miss
lawton
the
trap
has
been
baited
again
and
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
the
murderer
will
walk
straight
into
there
is
the
bell
i
gave
orders
that
you
were
to
be
at
home
to
no
one
except
the
man
i
expect
and
that
he
was
to
be
ushered
in
here
immediately
upon
his
arrival
without
being
announced
so
take
your
place
now
please
behind
the
curtains
do
not
try
to
watch
the
man
only
listen
with
all
your
ears
and
above
all
do
not
betray
yourself
until
the
proper
moment
comes
for
disclosing
your
presence
without
a
word
anita
disappeared
into
the
and
the
curtains
fell
into
place
behind
her
the
detective
had
only
time
to
step
in
the
shadow
of
a
dark
corner
beside
one
of
the
tall
bookcases
when
the
door
was
thrown
open
a
man
stood
upon
the
threshold
a
tall
fair
man
of
middle
age
with
a
small
blond
mustache
and
a
monocle
dangling
from
a
narrow
black
ribbon
about
his
neck
from
the
very
correct
gardenia
in
his
buttonhole
to
the
very
immaculate
spats
upon
his
feet
he
was
a
careful
prototype
of
the
piccadilly
exquisite
a
little
faded
perhaps
slightly
effete
but
perfect
in
detail
he
halted
for
a
moment
as
if
he
too
were
blinded
by
the
swift
change
from
sunshine
to
gloom
then
advancing
slowly
his
pale
protruding
eyes
wandered
to
the
great
chair
by
the
fireplace
and
lingered
as
if
fascinated
he
approached
it
magnetized
by
some
spell
of
his
own
thoughts
weaving
until
he
could
have
stretched
out
his
hand
and
touched
it
a
pause
and
with
a
sudden
swift
revulsion
of
feeling
he
turned
from
it
in
a
sort
of
horror
and
went
to
the
there
he
stood
for
a
moment
glanced
back
at
the
chair
then
quickly
about
the
room
his
eyes
passing
unseeingly
over
the
shadowy
figure
by
the
bookcase
then
he
darted
back
to
the
chair
and
thrust
his
hand
deep
into
the
fold
between
the
back
and
seat
for
a
minute
he
felt
about
with
frenzied
haste
until
his
fingers
touched
the
object
he
sought
and
with
a
profound
sigh
of
relief
he
drew
it
forth
a
tiny
flat
vial
he
glanced
at
it
casually
his
hand
already
raised
toward
his
then
he
recoiled
with
a
low
involuntary
cry
the
vial
was
filled
with
a
sinister
fluid
at
that
moment
blaine
stepped
from
behind
the
bookcase
and
confronted
him
you
have
succeeded
in
regaining
your
bottle
have
you
mr
rockamore
he
asked
significantly
are
you
surprised
to
find
within
it
the
blood
of
an
innocent
man
rockamore
turned
to
him
slowly
his
dazed
eyes
protruding
more
than
ever
blood
he
repeated
thickly
as
if
scarcely
understanding
then
a
realization
of
the
situation
dawned
upon
him
and
he
demanded
hoarsely
who
are
you
what
are
you
doing
here
my
name
is
blaine
and
i
am
here
to
arrest
the
murderer
of
pennington
lawton
the
detective
replied
his
dominant
tones
ringing
through
the
room
blaine
henry
blaine
rockamore
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
and
a
sneer
curled
his
thin
lips
although
his
face
had
suddenly
paled
i
heard
of
you
of
course
the
international
meddler
what
sort
of
sensation
are
you
trying
to
work
up
now
my
man
by
such
a
ridiculous
assertion
pennington
lawton
murdered
why
all
the
world
knows
that
he
died
of
all
the
world
seldom
knows
the
truth
but
it
shall
in
this
instance
returned
blaine
trenchantly
pennington
lawton
was
murdered
poisoned
by
a
draught
of
prussic
acid
you
mad
rockamore
retorted
insolently
he
tossed
the
incriminating
little
vial
carelessly
on
the
blotter
of
the
and
when
he
turned
again
to
the
detective
his
face
with
its
high
thin
hooked
nose
and
brows
was
in
its
malevolent
intensity
you
do
deserve
serious
consideration
if
you
make
public
such
a
ridiculous
statement
you
only
be
laughed
at
for
your
pains
i
shall
prove
it
the
murderer
midnight
visit
his
secret
conference
with
his
victim
did
not
proceed
unwitnessed
his
motive
is
known
but
his
act
was
futile
it
came
too
late
this
is
all
very
interesting
no
doubt
or
would
be
if
it
could
be
credited
however
i
can
not
understand
why
you
have
elected
to
take
me
into
your
confidence
rockamore
was
livid
but
he
controlled
himself
sufficiently
to
speak
with
a
simulation
of
contemptuous
boredom
i
came
here
to
see
miss
lawton
in
response
to
an
urgent
call
from
her
i
do
know
by
what
authority
you
are
here
but
i
do
know
that
i
do
not
propose
to
be
further
annoyed
by
you
i
am
afraid
that
you
will
find
yourself
very
seriously
annoyed
before
this
affair
comes
to
an
end
rockamore
said
blaine
miss
lawton
butler
summoned
you
this
afternoon
by
my
instructions
and
with
gratifying
promptness
you
came
and
did
just
what
i
expected
you
would
do
betrayed
yourself
irretrievably
in
your
haste
to
recover
the
evidence
which
now
will
hang
you
the
other
man
laughed
harshly
a
discordant
jarring
laugh
which
jangled
on
the
tense
air
your
accusation
is
too
absurd
to
be
resented
i
knew
that
miss
lawton
herself
could
not
have
been
a
party
to
this
melodramatic
hoax
blaine
walked
to
the
desk
before
replying
and
taking
up
the
vial
weighed
it
in
his
hand
you
did
not
find
the
poison
bottle
which
you
yourself
thrust
in
that
chair
the
night
pennington
lawton
died
rockamore
because
his
daughter
discovered
it
and
communicated
with
me
he
said
she
anticipated
you
by
less
than
hours
we
have
known
from
the
beginning
of
your
nocturnal
visit
to
this
room
every
word
of
your
conversation
was
overheard
it
no
use
trying
to
bluff
it
we
got
a
clear
case
against
you
you
and
your
case
be
d
d
the
other
man
cried
his
tones
shaking
with
anger
you
trying
to
bluff
me
my
man
but
it
work
i
do
know
what
the
devil
you
mean
about
a
midnight
visit
to
lawton
the
last
i
saw
of
him
was
at
a
directors
meeting
the
afternoon
before
his
death
then
why
has
that
chair
the
chair
in
which
he
died
exerted
such
a
peculiar
sinister
influence
over
you
why
is
it
that
every
time
you
have
entered
this
room
since
you
have
been
unable
to
keep
away
from
it
why
this
very
hour
when
you
thought
yourself
unobserved
did
you
walk
straight
to
this
chair
and
place
your
hand
deliberately
upon
the
place
where
the
poison
bottle
was
concealed
why
did
you
recoil
why
did
that
cry
rise
from
your
lips
when
you
saw
what
it
contained
i
touched
the
chair
inadvertently
while
i
waited
for
miss
appearance
and
my
hand
coming
accidentally
in
contact
with
a
hard
substance
mere
idle
curiosity
impelled
me
to
draw
it
out
naturally
i
was
startled
for
the
moment
when
i
saw
what
it
was
the
voice
deepened
hoarsely
and
he
gave
vent
to
another
sneering
vicious
laugh
as
its
echo
died
in
the
room
blaine
could
have
sworn
that
he
heard
a
quick
gasp
from
behind
the
curtains
of
the
but
it
did
not
reach
the
ears
of
rockamore
the
latter
continued
his
voice
breaking
suddenly
with
a
rage
at
last
uncontrolled
i
could
not
of
course
know
that
that
bottle
of
red
ink
was
a
cheap
theatrical
trick
of
a
mountebank
a
creature
who
is
the
of
the
press
and
the
public
in
his
idiotic
attempts
to
draw
sensational
notoriety
upon
himself
but
i
do
know
that
this
effort
has
failed
you
have
dared
to
plant
this
outrageous
puerile
trap
to
attempt
to
ensnare
me
you
have
dared
to
strike
blindly
in
your
mad
thirst
for
publicity
at
a
man
infinitely
beyond
your
reach
your
insolence
ceases
to
be
amusing
if
you
try
to
push
this
ridiculous
accusation
i
shall
ruin
you
henry
blaine
no
man
is
beyond
my
reach
who
has
broken
the
law
the
voice
was
quietly
controlled
yet
each
word
pierced
the
silence
like
a
i
have
been
threatened
with
ruin
with
death
many
times
by
criminals
of
all
classes
from
defaulting
financiers
to
petty
thieves
but
i
still
live
and
my
fortunes
have
not
been
materially
impaired
i
do
not
court
publicity
but
i
can
not
shirk
my
duty
because
it
entails
that
and
in
this
case
my
duty
is
plain
you
bertrand
rockamore
came
here
secretly
by
night
to
try
to
persuade
lawton
to
go
in
with
you
on
a
crooked
scheme
to
force
him
to
by
blackmail
if
necessary
on
an
old
score
failing
in
that
you
killed
him
to
prevent
the
nefarious
operations
of
yourself
and
your
companions
from
being
brought
to
light
you
mad
i
tell
you
roared
rockamore
whoever
stuffed
you
with
such
idiotic
rot
as
that
is
making
gammon
of
you
that
conversation
is
a
chimera
of
some
disordered
mind
if
it
is
merely
part
of
a
deliberate
conspiracy
of
yours
against
me
you
suffer
for
this
my
man
i
break
you
if
it
is
the
last
act
of
my
life
such
a
conference
never
took
place
and
you
know
it
lawton
be
sensible
half
a
loaf
is
better
than
no
bread
blaine
quoted
slowly
is
no
blackmail
about
this
it
is
an
ordinary
business
proposition
a
damnable
crooked
scheme
and
i
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
this
is
final
my
hands
are
clean
and
i
can
look
every
man
in
the
face
and
tell
him
to
go
where
you
can
go
now
you
remember
that
do
you
rockamore
blaine
interrupted
himself
to
ask
sharply
do
you
also
recall
your
reply
about
poor
herbert
armstrong
his
wife
it
a
lie
a
d
d
lie
cried
rockamore
i
was
not
in
this
room
that
night
such
a
conversation
never
occurred
who
told
you
of
this
who
dares
accuse
me
i
do
a
clear
voice
resonant
in
its
firmness
rang
out
from
behind
him
as
he
spoke
and
he
wheeled
abruptly
to
find
anita
standing
with
her
slender
form
outlined
against
the
dark
rich
velvet
of
the
curtains
her
head
was
thrown
back
her
eyes
blazing
and
as
she
faced
him
she
slowly
raised
her
arm
and
pointed
a
steady
finger
at
the
recoiling
figure
i
accuse
you
bertrand
rockamore
of
the
murder
of
my
father
it
was
i
who
heard
your
conversation
here
in
this
room
it
was
i
who
found
the
vial
which
contained
the
poison
you
used
when
your
arguments
and
threats
failed
i
am
not
mistaken
i
knew
that
i
could
never
be
mistaken
if
i
heard
that
voice
again
shaken
as
it
was
that
night
with
rage
and
defiance
and
fear
i
knew
that
i
should
hear
it
again
some
time
and
all
these
weeks
i
have
listened
for
it
until
this
moment
blaine
this
is
the
man
illustration
her
head
was
thrown
back
her
eyes
blazing
and
as
she
faced
him
she
slowly
raised
her
arm
and
pointed
a
steady
finger
at
the
recoiling
figure
anita
you
have
lost
your
mind
with
the
shock
of
the
appearance
a
steely
calm
had
come
to
the
englishman
and
although
a
tremor
ran
through
his
tones
he
held
them
well
in
leash
my
poor
child
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
as
for
you
he
turned
and
looked
levelly
into
blaine
eyes
i
am
amazed
that
a
man
of
your
perception
and
experience
should
for
a
moment
entertain
the
idea
that
he
could
make
out
a
case
of
capital
crime
against
a
person
of
my
standing
solely
upon
the
hysterical
of
a
girl
whose
brain
is
overwrought
this
midnight
conference
which
you
so
glibly
quote
is
a
figment
of
her
distraught
mind
or
if
it
actually
occurred
a
fact
of
which
you
have
no
proof
miss
lawton
admits
by
the
words
she
has
just
uttered
that
she
did
not
see
the
mysterious
visitor
but
is
attempting
to
identify
me
as
that
person
merely
by
the
tones
of
my
voice
she
has
made
no
accusation
against
me
until
this
moment
yet
since
her
father
death
she
has
heard
my
voice
almost
daily
for
several
weeks
come
blaine
listen
to
reason
your
case
has
tumbled
about
your
ears
you
can
only
avoid
serious
trouble
for
both
miss
lawton
and
yourself
by
dropping
this
absurd
matter
here
and
now
it
is
true
that
i
did
not
recognize
your
voice
before
but
i
have
not
until
now
heard
it
raised
in
anger
as
it
was
that
night
began
anita
but
blaine
silenced
her
with
a
gesture
and
the
bottle
of
prussic
acid
which
was
found
yesterday
hidden
in
the
chair
where
just
now
you
searched
for
it
he
demanded
sternly
the
incontrovertible
evidence
proved
late
last
night
by
an
autopsy
upon
the
body
of
pennington
lawton
which
shows
that
he
came
to
his
death
by
means
of
that
poison
how
do
you
account
for
these
facts
rockamore
i
do
not
propose
to
account
for
them
whether
they
are
facts
or
not
returned
the
other
man
coolly
since
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
them
they
are
beyond
my
province
unless
you
wish
to
bring
ruin
upon
yourself
and
unwelcome
notoriety
and
possibly
an
official
inquiry
into
her
sanity
upon
miss
lawton
you
will
not
repeat
this
incredible
accusation
only
my
very
real
sympathy
for
her
has
enabled
me
to
listen
with
what
patience
i
have
to
the
unparalleled
insolence
of
this
charge
but
you
are
going
too
far
i
see
no
necessity
for
further
prolonging
this
interview
and
with
your
permission
i
will
withdraw
unless
of
course
he
added
sneeringly
you
have
a
warrant
for
my
arrest
to
anita
astonishment
henry
blaine
stepped
back
with
a
slight
shrug
and
rockamore
still
with
that
sarcastic
leer
upon
his
lips
bowed
low
to
her
and
strode
from
the
room
you
you
let
him
go
mr
blaine
she
gasped
incredulously
you
let
him
escape
he
can
not
escape
blaine
smiled
a
trifle
grimly
i
giving
him
just
a
little
more
rope
that
is
all
to
see
if
he
will
help
us
secure
the
others
his
every
move
is
under
strict
surveillance
for
him
there
is
no
way
out
save
one
and
that
way
asked
anita
the
detective
made
no
reply
in
a
few
minutes
he
took
leave
of
her
and
proceeded
to
his
office
where
he
spent
a
busy
day
sending
cables
in
cipher
detailing
operatives
to
many
new
assignments
and
receiving
reports
late
in
the
afternoon
replies
began
to
come
in
to
his
cablegrams
of
the
morning
whatever
their
import
they
quite
evidently
afforded
him
immense
satisfaction
and
as
the
early
dusk
settled
down
his
eyes
began
to
glow
with
the
light
of
battle
which
those
closest
to
him
in
his
marvelous
work
had
learned
to
recognize
when
victory
was
in
sight
suraci
noted
it
when
he
entered
to
make
his
report
and
the
glint
of
enthusiasm
in
his
own
eyes
brightened
like
burnished
steel
i
relieved
ross
at
noon
as
you
instructed
me
sir
he
began
in
the
vestibule
of
rockamore
apartment
house
it
was
a
good
thing
that
i
had
the
car
handy
for
he
surely
led
me
a
chase
ten
minutes
after
i
went
on
duty
rockamore
came
out
jumped
into
his
automobile
and
after
circling
the
park
he
turned
south
through
side
streets
as
if
to
cut
off
pursuit
he
reached
ferry
but
hovered
about
until
the
gates
were
on
the
point
of
closing
then
his
chauffeur
shot
the
car
forward
but
before
i
could
reach
him
creghan
stepped
up
with
your
warrant
sorry
sir
i
heard
him
say
as
i
came
up
to
use
this
only
in
case
you
insist
on
attempting
to
leave
the
city
sir
orders
rockamore
turned
on
him
in
a
fury
but
thought
better
of
it
and
after
a
minute
he
leaned
forward
with
a
shrug
and
directed
the
chauffeur
north
again
this
time
he
tried
the
great
western
station
but
liebler
was
there
waiting
for
him
then
the
north
illington
branch
depot
schmidt
was
on
hand
as
a
forlorn
hope
he
tried
the
tropic
and
oriental
steamship
line
one
of
their
ships
goes
out
but
norris
intercepted
him
at
last
he
speeded
down
the
boulevard
and
out
on
the
eastern
but
kearney
was
on
the
job
at
the
he
gave
it
up
then
and
went
back
to
his
rooms
and
ross
relieved
me
there
just
now
the
lights
are
flaring
in
the
windows
of
his
rooms
and
you
can
see
his
shadow
he
pacing
up
and
down
like
a
caged
animal
all
right
suraci
go
back
and
tell
ross
to
have
one
of
his
men
telephone
to
me
at
once
if
rockamore
leaves
his
rooms
before
nine
that
will
be
all
for
you
i
got
to
do
the
rest
of
the
work
myself
at
nine
precisely
henry
blaine
presented
himself
at
rockamore
door
as
he
had
anticipated
he
was
admitted
at
once
and
ushered
into
the
englishman
presence
as
if
his
coming
had
been
expected
i
say
blaine
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
this
game
playing
rockamore
demanded
as
he
stood
erect
and
perfectly
poised
upon
the
hearth
and
faced
the
detective
a
faint
sarcastic
smile
curved
his
lips
and
in
his
pale
eyes
there
was
no
hint
of
trouble
or
fear
merely
a
look
of
tolerant
amusement
immaculate
in
his
and
fresh
boutonnière
his
bearing
superb
in
his
ease
and
condescension
he
presented
a
picture
of
elegance
blaine
glanced
about
the
rich
somber
den
before
he
replied
i
not
playing
any
game
rockamore
why
did
you
try
so
desperately
to
leave
the
city
the
englishman
shrugged
a
sudden
whim
i
suppose
would
it
be
divulging
a
secret
of
your
profession
if
you
informed
me
why
one
of
your
men
did
not
arrest
me
since
all
had
warrants
on
the
ridiculous
charge
you
brought
against
me
this
morning
of
murdering
my
oldest
and
closest
friend
i
merely
wanted
to
assure
myself
that
you
would
not
leave
the
city
until
i
had
obtained
sufficient
data
with
which
to
approach
you
the
detective
responded
imperturbably
i
have
come
for
a
little
talk
with
you
rockamore
i
trust
i
am
not
intruding
not
at
all
as
a
matter
of
fact
after
incidents
i
was
rather
expecting
you
rockamore
waved
his
unbidden
guest
to
a
chair
and
produced
a
gold
smoke
you
perhaps
prefer
cigars
no
a
brandy
and
soda
thank
you
no
with
your
permission
i
will
get
right
down
to
business
it
will
simplify
matters
for
both
of
us
if
you
are
willing
to
answer
some
questions
i
wish
to
put
to
you
but
of
course
there
is
no
compulsion
about
it
on
the
other
hand
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
that
anything
you
say
may
be
used
against
you
fire
away
mr
blaine
rockamore
seated
himself
and
stretched
out
his
legs
luxuriously
to
the
open
i
do
fancy
that
anything
i
shall
say
will
militate
against
me
i
was
an
idiot
to
lose
my
temper
this
morning
but
i
hate
being
made
game
of
now
the
whole
situation
merely
amuses
me
but
it
may
become
tiresome
let
get
it
over
rockamore
you
were
born
in
staffordshire
england
were
you
not
near
a
place
called
handsworth
the
unexpected
question
brought
a
meditative
frown
to
the
other
brow
but
he
replied
readily
enough
yes
at
handsworth
castle
to
be
exact
but
i
ca
quite
gather
what
bearing
that
insignificant
fact
has
upon
your
amazing
charge
this
morning
you
are
the
only
son
of
gerald
cecil
rockamore
third
son
of
the
earl
of
stafford
the
detective
did
not
appear
to
have
heard
the
protest
of
the
man
he
was
interrogating
precisely
but
what
there
were
then
four
lives
between
you
and
the
title
blaine
interrupted
tersely
but
two
remain
your
father
and
grandfather
your
uncles
died
both
of
sudden
attacks
of
and
curiously
enough
both
deaths
occurred
while
they
were
visiting
at
handsworth
castle
that
is
quite
true
the
cynical
banter
was
gone
from
tones
and
he
spoke
with
a
peculiar
hushed
evenness
as
if
he
waited
on
guard
for
the
next
thrust
lord
ashfrith
your
father
oldest
brother
and
next
in
line
to
the
old
earl
was
seated
in
the
of
the
castle
sipping
a
brandy
and
soda
and
carving
a
twenty
minutes
before
you
had
brought
the
peaches
in
from
the
garden
and
eaten
them
with
him
he
was
showing
you
how
in
his
boyhood
he
had
carved
a
from
a
and
you
were
close
at
his
side
when
he
suddenly
fell
over
dead
two
years
later
your
uncle
alaric
heir
to
the
earldom
since
his
older
brother
was
out
of
the
way
dropped
dead
at
a
hunt
breakfast
you
were
seated
next
him
are
you
trying
to
insinuate
that
i
had
anything
to
do
with
these
deaths
rockamore
still
spoke
quietly
but
there
was
a
slight
tremor
in
his
tones
and
his
face
looked
suddenly
gray
and
leaden
in
the
glow
of
the
leaping
flames
i
am
recalling
certain
facts
in
your
family
history
when
your
uncle
alaric
died
he
had
just
set
down
his
cordial
glass
which
had
contained
peach
brandy
an
odd
coincidence
was
it
that
both
of
these
men
died
with
the
odor
of
peaches
about
them
an
odor
which
incidentally
you
had
provided
in
both
cases
for
it
was
you
who
suggested
the
peach
brandy
as
a
cordial
at
the
hunt
breakfast
and
induced
your
uncle
to
partake
of
it
it
was
a
coincidence
as
you
say
i
had
not
thought
of
it
before
the
englishman
moistened
his
lips
nervously
as
if
they
suddenly
felt
dry
uncle
alaric
was
a
heavy
man
and
he
had
ridden
hard
that
morning
contrary
to
the
doctor
orders
i
suggested
the
brandy
as
a
bracer
i
remember
an
unfortunate
suggestion
was
it
blaine
asked
significantly
the
other
man
made
no
reply
there
was
another
coincidence
the
detective
pursued
relentlessly
the
which
lord
ashfrith
was
drinking
at
the
moment
of
his
death
was
naturally
a
pale
amber
color
so
was
the
brandy
which
your
uncle
alaric
drank
as
he
died
and
prussic
acid
is
too
rockamore
lord
ashfrith
was
carving
a
when
the
end
came
and
the
odor
of
peaches
clung
to
his
body
your
uncle
alaric
partook
of
peach
brandy
and
the
same
odor
hovered
about
him
in
death
prussic
acid
is
redolent
of
the
odor
of
peaches
rockamore
started
from
his
chair
i
understand
what
you
are
attempting
to
establish
by
the
flimsiest
of
circumstantial
evidence
he
sneered
but
you
are
away
beyond
your
depth
my
man
may
i
ask
where
you
obtained
this
interesting
but
scarcely
valuable
information
from
scotland
yard
by
cable
blaine
rose
also
and
faced
the
other
man
an
investigation
was
started
into
the
second
death
upon
the
earl
request
but
it
was
dropped
for
lack
of
evidence
about
that
time
rockamore
you
decided
rather
suddenly
and
for
no
apparent
reason
to
come
to
america
where
you
have
remained
ever
since
blaine
if
i
were
in
the
mood
to
be
facetious
i
might
employ
your
american
vernacular
and
ask
that
you
tell
me
something
i
know
come
to
the
point
man
you
try
my
patience
in
view
of
recent
developments
i
am
under
the
impression
that
scotland
yard
would
welcome
your
reappearance
on
british
soil
but
i
fear
that
will
be
forever
impossible
blaine
said
slowly
just
as
you
were
beside
your
uncles
when
each
met
with
his
end
so
you
were
beside
pennington
lawton
when
death
came
to
him
that
has
been
proved
just
as
brandy
and
soda
and
peach
brandy
are
so
are
scotch
which
you
and
pennington
lawton
were
drinking
no
odor
of
peaches
lingered
about
the
room
for
miss
lawton
had
lighted
a
handful
of
in
a
vase
upon
the
mantel
earlier
in
the
evening
and
their
pungent
perfume
filled
the
air
but
the
odor
of
peaches
permeated
the
room
when
the
tiny
bottle
which
you
hid
in
the
folds
of
the
chair
was
uncorked
the
odor
of
peaches
rose
above
the
stench
of
mortifying
flesh
when
the
body
of
your
victim
was
exhumed
late
last
night
for
a
belated
autopsy
the
heart
would
have
revealed
the
truth
had
there
been
no
corroborative
evidence
for
it
was
filled
with
arterial
blood
incontrovertible
proof
of
death
by
poisoning
there
was
a
tense
pause
and
then
rockamore
spoke
sharply
his
voice
strained
to
the
breaking
point
if
you
are
so
certain
of
my
guilt
blaine
why
have
you
come
to
me
secretly
here
and
now
what
is
your
price
i
have
no
price
the
great
detective
answered
simply
then
why
did
you
not
arrest
me
at
once
why
this
purposeless
interview
because
blaine
paused
and
when
he
spoke
again
a
solemn
hush
almost
of
pity
had
crept
into
his
tones
you
come
of
a
fine
old
line
rockamore
of
a
splendid
race
your
grandfather
the
aged
earl
is
living
only
in
the
past
proud
of
the
record
of
his
forebears
your
father
is
a
soldier
and
statesman
valuable
to
the
nation
his
younger
brother
cedric
has
achieved
deserved
fame
and
glory
in
the
boer
war
there
remains
only
you
for
the
sake
of
the
innocent
who
must
suffer
with
you
i
have
come
to
you
that
you
may
have
an
opportunity
to
prepare
yourself
in
the
morning
i
must
arrest
you
my
duty
is
plain
as
he
uttered
the
words
the
craven
fear
which
had
struggled
through
the
malicious
sneer
on
the
other
man
face
faded
as
if
an
obliterating
hand
had
passed
across
his
brow
and
a
look
of
indomitable
courage
and
resignation
took
its
place
there
was
something
akin
to
nobility
in
his
expression
as
he
turned
to
the
detective
with
head
proudly
erect
and
shoulders
squared
i
thank
you
blaine
he
said
simply
i
understand
i
shall
not
fail
them
the
others
you
have
been
far
more
generous
to
me
than
i
deserve
and
now
you
will
find
me
here
when
you
come
in
the
morning
but
in
the
morning
henry
blaine
did
not
carry
out
his
expressed
intention
instead
he
sat
at
his
desk
staring
at
the
headlines
in
a
paper
spread
out
before
him
the
honorable
bertrand
rockamore
had
been
found
dead
on
the
floor
of
his
den
with
a
bullet
through
his
head
he
would
never
allow
his
man
to
touch
his
guns
and
had
been
engaged
in
cleaning
one
of
them
as
was
his
custom
in
preparation
for
his
annual
shooting
trip
to
florida
when
in
some
fashion
it
had
been
accidentally
discharged
i
wonder
if
i
did
the
right
thing
mused
blaine
he
had
the
courage
to
do
it
after
all
blood
will
tell
in
the
end
chapter
xix
the
unseen
listener
there
a
man
outside
who
wishes
to
speak
to
you
sir
says
his
name
is
hicks
but
wo
tell
his
business
blaine
looked
up
from
the
paper
never
heard
of
him
what
sort
of
a
man
marsh
old
carries
himself
like
an
old
family
servant
of
some
sort
looks
as
if
he
been
crying
he
trembling
so
he
can
scarcely
stand
and
seems
deeply
affected
by
something
says
he
has
a
message
for
you
and
must
see
you
personally
very
well
show
him
in
thank
you
for
receiving
me
sir
a
quavering
old
voice
sounded
from
the
doorway
a
moment
later
and
blaine
turned
in
his
chair
to
face
the
aged
erect
figure
which
stood
there
come
in
hicks
the
detective
voice
was
kindly
sit
down
here
and
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
you
i
bring
you
a
message
sir
the
man
tottered
to
the
chair
and
sank
into
it
a
message
from
the
dead
blaine
leaned
forward
suddenly
you
were
rockamore
valet
sir
and
his
father
before
him
i
loved
him
as
if
he
were
my
own
son
if
you
will
pardon
the
liberty
i
take
in
saying
so
and
when
he
came
to
this
country
i
accompanied
him
he
was
always
good
to
me
sir
a
kind
young
master
and
a
real
friend
it
was
i
who
found
him
this
morning
his
voice
broke
and
he
bowed
his
head
upon
his
wrinkled
hands
no
tears
came
but
the
thin
shoulders
shook
and
a
dry
sob
tore
its
way
from
the
gaunt
throat
blaine
waited
until
the
paroxysm
had
ceased
and
then
urged
gently
go
on
hicks
you
have
something
to
tell
me
yes
sir
the
coroner
and
the
press
call
it
accidental
death
but
i
may
god
forgive
me
for
saying
it
i
know
better
he
left
word
where
none
could
find
it
but
me
that
you
knew
the
truth
and
he
bade
me
give
you
this
he
produced
a
large
square
envelope
from
an
inner
pocket
and
extended
it
in
his
trembling
hand
to
the
detective
without
glancing
at
it
blaine
laid
it
on
the
desk
before
him
where
did
you
discover
this
there
is
a
flat
oblong
casket
of
old
silver
shaped
somewhat
like
a
humidor
a
family
relic
sir
which
stands
upon
the
in
the
den
whenever
rockamore
had
any
message
to
leave
for
me
in
writing
concerning
his
confidential
business
which
he
did
not
wish
the
other
servants
to
have
access
to
he
always
slipped
it
into
the
casket
after
the
coroner
had
come
and
gone
this
morning
and
some
of
the
excitement
had
died
down
i
went
back
to
the
den
to
straighten
it
i
do
know
why
but
somehow
i
half
suspected
the
truth
perhaps
it
was
the
expression
of
his
face
so
peaceful
and
resigned
with
all
the
hard
sneering
lines
the
years
had
brought
gone
from
it
so
that
he
looked
almost
like
a
boy
again
the
bonny
boy
who
used
to
ride
on
his
pony
through
the
lanes
of
staffordshire
long
ago
the
aged
man
spoke
half
to
himself
and
seemed
to
have
fallen
into
a
reverie
which
blaine
made
no
attempt
to
break
in
upon
at
length
he
roused
himself
with
a
little
start
and
went
on
at
any
rate
when
i
had
the
room
in
order
and
was
standing
by
the
table
taking
a
last
look
about
my
hand
rested
on
the
casket
and
quite
without
thinking
sir
i
raised
the
lid
there
within
it
lay
a
sealed
envelope
with
my
name
on
it
inside
was
a
certified
check
for
two
thousand
pounds
made
out
to
me
he
did
forget
me
even
at
the
last
and
that
letter
for
you
together
with
a
little
note
asking
me
to
to
take
him
home
is
it
true
sir
that
you
do
know
the
whole
truth
i
think
i
do
blaine
responded
gravely
i
did
the
best
i
could
for
your
late
master
hicks
all
that
i
could
do
which
was
compatible
with
my
duty
and
now
my
lips
are
sealed
i
can
not
betray
his
confidence
you
intend
to
accompany
the
body
to
england
of
course
sir
the
old
man
said
simply
it
was
his
last
request
of
me
who
have
never
refused
him
anything
in
all
his
life
when
i
have
seen
him
laid
beside
the
others
of
the
house
of
stafford
i
will
go
back
to
the
castle
to
his
father
and
end
my
days
there
my
course
is
nearly
run
and
this
great
new
country
has
no
place
in
it
for
the
aged
i
i
will
go
now
sir
i
have
much
to
attend
to
and
my
master
is
lying
alone
when
the
old
servant
had
taken
his
departure
henry
blaine
picked
up
the
envelope
it
was
addressed
in
a
firm
unshaken
hand
and
with
a
last
touch
of
the
sardonic
humor
characteristic
of
the
dead
man
it
had
been
stamped
with
the
seal
of
the
renowned
and
honored
house
of
stafford
the
detective
broke
the
seal
and
lifting
the
flap
drew
out
the
folded
letter
page
and
became
immediately
absorbed
in
its
contents
he
read
in
view
of
your
magnanimity
i
feel
that
this
explanation
call
it
a
confession
if
you
will
is
your
due
if
you
consider
it
your
duty
to
give
it
to
the
world
at
large
you
must
do
so
but
for
god
sake
be
as
merciful
as
you
can
to
those
at
home
who
will
suffer
enough
in
all
conscience
as
the
affair
now
stands
your
accusation
was
justified
i
killed
pennington
lawton
in
the
manner
and
for
the
reason
which
you
alleged
i
made
an
appointment
by
telephone
just
after
dinner
to
call
upon
him
late
that
night
i
tried
by
every
means
in
my
power
to
induce
him
to
go
in
on
a
scheme
to
which
unknown
to
him
i
had
already
committed
him
he
steadfastly
refused
his
death
was
the
only
way
for
me
to
obviate
exposure
and
ruin
and
the
disgrace
of
a
prison
sentence
i
anticipated
his
attitude
and
had
come
prepared
during
a
heated
period
of
our
discussion
he
walked
to
the
desk
and
stood
for
a
moment
with
his
shoulder
turned
to
me
searching
for
a
paper
in
his
private
drawer
i
saw
my
chance
and
seized
upon
it
i
was
standing
before
his
chair
i
may
explain
watching
him
over
its
high
back
i
took
the
vial
of
prussic
acid
from
my
pocket
uncorked
it
and
poured
a
few
drops
into
his
glass
i
had
recorked
the
vial
and
was
on
the
point
of
returning
it
to
its
when
he
turned
to
me
had
i
raised
my
hand
to
my
pocket
he
would
have
noticed
the
gesture
as
it
was
the
back
of
the
chair
screened
me
and
on
a
sudden
desperate
impulse
i
thrust
the
vial
deep
in
the
leather
fold
between
the
seat
and
back
lawton
drank
and
died
i
left
the
house
as
i
thought
unnoticed
and
secure
from
detection
on
subsequent
visits
to
the
house
i
endeavored
to
regain
possession
of
the
vial
but
on
each
occasion
i
failed
in
my
purpose
and
at
length
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
anita
lawton
i
have
no
more
to
say
of
earlier
events
at
home
in
england
which
you
and
i
discussed
it
is
better
that
i
remain
silent
you
of
all
men
will
appreciate
my
motive
and
now
blaine
please
accept
my
heartfelt
thanks
for
the
manner
in
which
you
handled
a
most
difficult
situation
you
have
beaten
me
fairly
at
my
own
game
it
may
be
that
we
shall
meet
again
somewhere
some
time
in
all
sincerity
yours
arthur
bertrand
rockamore
the
detective
folded
the
letter
slowly
and
returned
it
to
its
envelope
then
he
sat
for
long
buried
in
thought
rockamore
had
taken
the
solitary
loophole
of
escape
from
overwhelming
disgrace
left
to
him
he
had
as
far
as
in
him
lay
expiated
his
crimes
what
need
then
to
blazon
them
forth
to
a
gaping
world
pennington
lawton
had
died
of
so
said
the
coroner
the
press
had
echoed
him
and
the
public
accepted
that
fact
only
two
living
persons
beside
the
coroner
knew
the
truth
and
blaine
felt
sure
that
the
gentle
spirit
of
anita
lawton
would
be
merciful
her
thirst
for
vengeance
upon
her
father
murderer
sated
by
his
death
to
those
of
his
blood
who
innocent
must
be
dragged
in
the
mire
by
the
disclosure
of
his
infamy
when
henry
blaine
presented
himself
an
hour
later
at
her
home
he
found
anita
inexpressibly
shocked
by
the
tragic
event
of
the
night
he
was
guilty
she
murmured
he
took
his
own
life
to
escape
falling
into
your
hands
that
gunshot
was
no
accident
blaine
he
murdered
my
father
in
cold
blood
but
he
has
paid
i
abhor
his
memory
and
yet
i
can
find
it
in
my
heart
to
be
sorry
for
him
in
silence
the
detective
placed
in
her
hands
the
letter
of
the
dead
man
and
watched
her
face
as
she
slowly
read
it
when
she
looked
up
her
eyes
were
wet
and
a
tiny
red
spot
glowed
in
either
cheek
poor
father
she
moaned
with
all
his
leadership
and
knowledge
of
men
he
was
helpless
and
unsuspecting
in
the
hands
of
that
merciless
fiend
and
yet
even
he
thought
of
his
own
people
at
the
last
and
wanted
to
spare
them
oh
how
i
wish
we
could
if
we
might
only
keep
from
them
forever
the
knowledge
of
his
wickedness
his
crime
we
can
if
you
are
willing
blaine
met
her
look
of
startled
inquiry
and
replied
to
it
with
a
brief
résumé
of
his
interview
of
the
previous
evening
with
rockamore
when
he
added
his
suggestion
that
the
matter
of
the
way
in
which
her
father
came
to
his
death
be
buried
in
oblivion
and
the
public
left
to
believe
the
first
report
she
was
silent
for
a
time
but
the
coroner
who
performed
the
autopsy
night
before
last
she
remarked
at
length
hesitatingly
he
will
make
the
truth
public
will
he
not
not
necessarily
that
depends
upon
you
if
you
wish
it
nothing
will
ever
be
known
i
think
you
are
right
blaine
father
death
has
been
avenged
neither
you
nor
i
can
do
more
the
man
who
killed
him
has
gone
to
his
last
account
further
notoriety
and
scandal
can
not
help
father
or
bring
him
back
to
me
it
would
only
cause
needless
suffering
to
those
who
are
no
more
at
fault
than
we
ourselves
if
the
coroner
can
be
silenced
we
will
keep
our
secret
you
and
i
unless
blaine
voice
was
very
grave
unless
it
becomes
necessary
to
divulge
it
in
order
to
get
the
rest
of
them
within
our
grasp
the
rest
she
looked
up
as
if
she
had
scarcely
heard
mallowe
and
carlis
and
paddington
and
the
horde
of
lesser
conspirators
in
their
hire
we
must
recover
your
father
immense
fortune
and
find
out
how
it
was
possible
for
them
to
divert
it
to
their
own
channels
there
is
hamilton
to
be
thought
of
too
his
injury
his
kidnaping
if
we
can
succeed
in
unraveling
this
mysterious
tangle
of
events
without
recourse
to
the
fact
of
our
knowledge
of
the
murder
well
and
good
if
not
we
must
make
use
of
whatever
has
come
to
our
hand
with
the
rest
of
the
malefactors
brought
to
justice
you
can
afford
to
be
magnanimous
even
to
the
dead
man
who
has
done
you
the
most
grievous
wrong
of
all
it
shall
be
as
you
say
she
broke
off
suddenly
as
her
eyes
looking
beyond
blaine
shoulder
fell
upon
a
silent
figure
in
the
doorway
mr
mallowe
she
cried
when
did
you
come
how
is
it
that
wilkes
failed
to
announce
you
i
arrived
just
at
this
moment
the
smooth
unctuous
tones
floated
out
upon
the
strained
tension
of
the
air
i
told
wilkes
i
would
come
right
up
he
told
me
blaine
was
with
you
and
i
wish
to
congratulate
him
on
his
marvelous
success
surely
you
do
not
mind
the
liberty
i
took
in
announcing
myself
my
dear
child
not
at
all
anita
responded
coldly
to
which
success
of
blaine
do
you
refer
mr
mallowe
why
to
his
discovery
of
ramon
of
course
mallowe
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
them
as
if
nonplused
by
anita
unexpected
attitude
then
he
continued
hurriedly
with
a
show
of
enthusiasm
it
was
wonderful
unprecedented
but
how
did
ramon
come
to
be
in
mac
alarney
retreat
and
so
shockingly
injured
the
same
people
who
ran
him
down
the
day
miss
lawton
sent
for
him
to
come
to
her
aid
the
day
she
learned
of
her
father
insolvency
blaine
spoke
quickly
before
the
girl
had
an
opportunity
to
reply
the
same
people
who
on
two
other
separate
occasions
attempted
his
life
you
can
not
mean
to
tell
me
that
there
is
some
conspiracy
on
foot
against
ramon
hamilton
mallowe
face
was
a
picture
of
shocked
amazement
but
why
he
is
the
most
exemplary
of
young
men
quite
a
model
in
these
days
because
he
is
a
man
and
prepared
to
protect
and
defend
to
the
last
ounce
of
his
strength
the
thing
which
he
loved
better
than
life
itself
the
thing
which
but
for
him
stood
helpless
and
alone
surrounded
by
enemies
and
hopelessly
entangled
in
the
meshes
of
a
gigantic
conspiracy
you
speak
in
riddles
mr
blaine
mallowe
gray
brows
drew
together
riddles
which
will
soon
be
answered
mallowe
miss
natural
protector
her
father
had
been
ruthlessly
removed
by
death
only
hamilton
stood
between
her
and
the
machinations
of
those
who
thought
they
had
her
in
their
power
therefore
hamilton
was
also
removed
temporarily
do
i
make
myself
quite
clear
now
it
is
impossible
incredible
what
enemies
could
this
dear
child
here
have
made
and
who
could
wish
to
harm
her
besides
am
i
not
here
do
not
i
and
my
friends
stand
in
to
her
as
you
doubtless
are
aware
one
of
miss
lawton
at
least
has
involuntarily
resigned
his
wardenship
blaine
remarked
you
refer
to
the
sudden
death
last
night
of
my
associate
mr
rockamore
mallowe
shook
his
head
dolorously
a
terrible
accident
the
news
was
an
inexpressible
shock
to
me
it
was
to
comfort
miss
lawton
for
the
blow
which
the
loss
of
this
devoted
friend
must
be
to
her
that
i
came
i
fancy
the
loss
itself
will
be
consolation
enough
mallowe
the
accident
was
tragic
of
course
it
takes
courage
to
clean
a
gun
sometimes
more
courage
perhaps
than
to
spill
into
a
glass
an
ingredient
not
usually
included
in
a
scotch
highball
let
us
say
blaine
if
you
are
inclined
to
be
facetious
sir
let
me
tell
you
this
is
neither
the
time
nor
place
for
an
attempt
at
a
jest
when
miss
lawton
called
you
in
the
other
day
and
engaged
you
to
search
for
hamilton
oh
she
did
call
me
in
then
mallowe
i
been
on
the
case
from
the
start
all
this
last
month
in
fact
and
in
close
touch
with
miss
lawton
every
day
mallowe
started
back
the
light
of
comprehension
dawning
swiftly
in
his
eyes
only
instantly
to
be
veiled
with
a
film
of
craftiness
what
case
he
asked
ramon
hamilton
has
not
been
missing
for
a
month
the
case
of
the
death
of
pennington
lawton
the
case
of
his
fraudulently
alleged
bankruptcy
the
case
of
the
whole
damnable
conspiracy
to
crush
this
girl
to
the
earth
to
impoverish
her
and
tarnish
the
fair
name
and
honored
memory
of
her
father
it
cards
on
the
table
now
mallowe
and
i
going
to
win
you
must
be
mad
exclaimed
the
older
man
this
talk
of
a
conspiracy
is
ridiculous
absurd
rockamore
called
me
also
yesterday
afternoon
standing
just
where
you
stand
now
mr
mallowe
the
detective
met
the
lowering
eyes
squarely
yet
he
went
home
and
accidentally
shot
himself
a
curiously
opportune
shot
that
miss
lawton
enemies
depended
too
confidently
upon
her
credulity
in
accepting
without
question
the
unsubstantiated
assertion
of
her
father
insolvency
they
did
not
take
into
account
the
possibility
that
their
henchman
paddington
might
fail
or
turn
traitor
that
mac
alarney
might
talk
to
save
his
own
hide
that
jimmy
brunell
forgeries
might
be
traced
to
their
source
that
the
books
in
the
office
of
the
recorder
of
deeds
might
divulge
interesting
items
to
those
sufficiently
concerned
to
delve
into
the
files
of
past
years
you
discharged
your
clerk
on
the
flimsiest
of
excuses
mallowe
but
you
did
not
discharge
her
quite
soon
enough
rockamore
stenographer
and
the
switchboard
operator
in
carlis
office
who
like
your
filing
clerk
came
from
miss
club
were
also
dismissed
too
late
as
i
have
said
my
cards
are
on
the
table
now
are
you
prepared
to
play
yours
for
answer
mallowe
turned
slowly
to
anita
his
face
a
study
of
pained
surprise
and
indignation
my
dear
girl
i
do
not
understand
one
word
of
what
this
person
is
saying
but
he
is
either
mad
or
intoxicated
with
his
success
in
locating
ramon
to
the
extent
that
he
is
endeavoring
to
build
up
a
fictitious
case
on
a
maze
of
lies
any
notoriety
will
bring
him
welcome
publicity
and
that
is
all
he
is
looking
for
i
shall
take
immediate
steps
to
have
his
incomprehensible
and
dangerous
allegation
suppressed
such
a
man
is
a
menace
to
the
community
in
the
meantime
i
must
beg
of
you
to
dismiss
him
at
once
do
not
listen
to
him
do
not
allow
him
to
influence
you
you
are
only
an
impulsive
credulous
girl
and
he
is
using
you
as
a
mere
tool
for
his
own
ends
i
can
not
imagine
how
you
happened
to
fall
into
his
clutches
anita
faced
him
straight
and
slim
and
tall
and
her
soft
eyes
seemed
fairly
to
burn
into
his
i
am
not
so
credulous
as
you
think
mallowe
i
never
for
a
moment
believed
your
assertion
that
my
father
died
a
pauper
and
i
took
immediate
steps
to
disprove
it
doctor
franklin
was
your
tool
when
he
came
to
me
with
your
message
but
not
i
and
i
should
advise
you
to
try
at
this
late
date
to
blaine
many
other
malefactors
have
attempted
it
i
understand
in
the
past
but
i
never
heard
of
any
of
them
meeting
with
conspicuous
success
you
and
my
other
two
guardians
must
have
been
desperate
indeed
to
have
risked
trying
to
hoodwink
me
with
so
ridiculous
and
vague
a
story
as
that
of
the
loss
of
my
father
fortune
this
is
too
much
mallowe
stormed
young
woman
you
forget
yourself
because
of
the
evil
suggestions
the
malevolent
influence
of
this
man
plausible
lies
are
you
such
an
ingrate
as
to
turn
upon
your
only
friends
your
father
intimate
associates
the
people
who
have
from
disinterested
motives
of
the
purest
kindness
and
affection
provided
for
you
comforted
you
and
shielded
you
from
the
world
anita
i
can
not
believe
it
of
you
i
will
leave
you
now
i
am
positively
overcome
with
this
added
shock
of
your
ingratitude
and
willful
deceit
coming
so
soon
after
the
blow
of
my
poor
death
i
trust
you
will
be
in
a
thoroughly
repentant
frame
of
mind
when
next
i
see
you
as
for
you
sir
he
turned
to
the
immovable
figure
of
the
detective
i
will
soon
show
you
what
it
means
to
meddle
with
matters
which
do
not
concern
you
to
pit
yourself
arrogantly
against
the
biggest
power
in
this
country
the
biggest
power
in
this
or
any
other
country
is
the
power
of
justice
blaine
voice
rang
out
trenchantly
when
you
and
your
associates
planned
this
desperate
it
was
as
a
last
resort
you
had
involved
yourselves
too
deeply
you
had
gone
too
far
to
retrace
your
steps
you
were
forced
to
go
on
forward
and
now
your
path
is
closed
with
bars
of
iron
i
will
not
remain
here
any
longer
to
be
insulted
miss
lawton
i
shall
never
cross
the
threshold
of
this
house
again
this
house
which
only
by
my
charity
you
have
been
suffered
to
remain
in
until
you
apologize
for
the
disgraceful
scene
here
this
morning
i
can
only
hope
that
you
will
soon
come
to
your
senses
as
he
strode
indignantly
from
the
room
anita
turned
anxiously
to
henry
blaine
oh
what
will
he
do
she
whispered
he
is
really
a
power
a
you
know
blaine
where
will
he
go
now
straight
to
his
carlis
and
tell
him
that
the
game
is
up
the
detective
spoke
with
brisk
confidence
he
be
tailed
by
my
men
anyway
so
we
shall
soon
have
a
report
do
see
anyone
on
any
pretext
whatsoever
and
do
leave
the
house
miss
lawton
i
will
instruct
wilkes
on
my
way
out
that
you
are
to
be
at
home
to
no
one
i
must
be
getting
back
to
my
office
now
if
i
am
not
mistaken
i
shall
receive
a
visit
without
unnecessary
delay
from
my
old
friend
timothy
carlis
and
i
would
miss
it
for
the
world
blaine
prediction
proved
to
have
been
well
founded
scarcely
an
hour
passed
and
he
was
deep
in
the
study
of
some
of
his
earlier
notes
on
the
case
when
all
at
once
a
hubbub
arose
in
his
outer
office
usually
quiet
and
its
customary
stillness
was
broken
by
a
confused
expostulatory
murmur
of
voices
above
which
rose
a
strident
angry
bellow
like
that
of
a
maddened
wild
beast
then
a
chair
was
violently
overturned
the
sudden
sharp
sound
of
a
scuffle
came
to
the
detective
listening
ears
and
the
door
was
dashed
open
with
a
jar
which
made
the
massive
inkstand
upon
the
desk
quiver
timothy
carlis
stood
upon
the
threshold
timothy
carlis
his
face
empurpled
the
great
veins
upon
his
forehead
standing
out
like
whipcords
his
huge
spatulate
hands
clenched
his
narrow
slit
eyes
gleaming
murderously
so
you
here
after
all
he
roared
those
d
d
fools
out
there
tried
to
give
me
the
wrong
steer
but
i
was
wise
to
you
buffaloed
rockamore
and
that
senile
old
idiot
mallowe
but
you
ca
bluff
me
i
came
here
to
see
you
and
i
usually
get
what
i
go
after
having
seen
me
carlis
will
you
kindly
state
your
business
and
go
this
promises
to
be
one
of
my
busiest
days
what
can
i
do
for
you
blaine
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
a
bland
smile
of
pleased
expectancy
it
ai
what
you
do
it
what
you
to
do
and
no
mistake
about
it
the
other
glowered
you
goin
to
keep
your
mouth
shut
as
tight
as
a
trap
and
your
hands
off
from
now
on
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
right
enough
do
try
to
work
the
surprised
gag
on
me
he
added
the
latter
with
a
coarse
sneer
which
further
distorted
his
inflamed
visage
blaine
with
an
expression
of
sharp
inquiry
had
whirled
around
in
his
swivel
chair
to
face
his
excited
visitor
and
as
he
did
so
his
hand
with
seeming
inadvertence
had
for
an
instant
come
in
contact
with
the
under
ledge
of
his
i
afraid
much
as
i
desire
not
to
prolong
this
unexpected
interview
that
i
must
ask
you
to
explain
just
what
it
is
that
i
must
keep
my
hands
off
of
as
you
say
we
will
go
into
the
wherefore
of
it
later
carlis
glanced
back
of
him
into
the
empty
hallway
then
closed
the
door
and
came
forward
menacingly
what
the
good
of
beating
about
the
bush
he
demanded
in
a
fierce
undertone
you
know
d
n
well
what
i
mean
you
butting
in
on
the
lawton
affair
you
bitten
off
more
than
you
can
chew
and
better
wise
yourself
up
to
that
here
and
now
just
what
is
the
lawton
affair
oh
stow
that
bluff
you
know
too
much
already
and
if
i
followed
my
hunch
i
scrag
you
now
to
play
safe
dead
men
do
blab
as
a
rule
though
one
may
have
last
night
i
came
here
to
be
generous
to
give
you
a
last
chance
i
fought
tooth
and
nail
myself
for
my
place
at
the
top
and
i
like
a
game
scrapper
even
if
he
is
on
the
wrong
side
you
tried
to
get
me
for
years
but
as
i
knew
you
could
i
did
bother
with
you
any
more
than
i
would
with
a
trained
flea
and
i
bear
no
malice
d
d
if
i
do
like
you
blaine
thank
you
the
detective
bowed
in
ironic
acknowledgment
of
the
compliment
your
friendship
would
be
considered
a
valuable
asset
by
many
i
have
no
doubt
but
look
here
the
great
political
boss
had
shed
his
bulldozing
manner
and
a
shade
of
unmistakable
earnestness
not
unmixed
with
anxiety
had
crept
into
his
tones
i
talking
as
man
to
man
and
i
know
i
can
trust
your
word
of
honor
even
if
you
pretend
you
wo
take
mine
is
anyone
listening
have
you
got
any
of
your
infernal
operatives
spying
about
blaine
leaned
forward
and
replied
with
deep
seriousness
i
give
you
my
word
carlis
that
no
human
ear
is
overhearing
our
conversation
then
he
smiled
and
added
with
a
touch
of
mockery
but
what
difference
can
that
make
i
thought
you
came
here
to
issue
instructions
at
least
you
so
announced
yourself
on
your
arrival
because
i
going
to
make
a
proposition
to
you
on
my
own
even
carlis
coarse
face
flushed
darkly
at
the
base
pennington
lawton
died
of
he
paused
and
after
waiting
a
full
minute
blaine
remarked
quietly
but
with
marked
significance
of
course
that
is
is
it
well
then
carlis
stepped
back
with
a
satisfied
grunt
he
have
a
soul
on
earth
dependent
on
him
but
his
daughter
his
great
fortune
is
swept
away
and
that
daughter
left
penniless
but
there
lots
of
girls
in
this
world
worse
off
than
she
ai
she
got
good
friends
that
lookin
out
for
her
and
seein
that
she
want
for
a
thing
ai
she
goin
to
marry
a
young
fellow
that
loves
the
ground
she
walks
on
a
rich
young
fellow
that
give
her
everything
all
her
life
what
more
could
she
want
all
right
but
the
big
money
the
money
lawton
made
by
grinding
down
the
masses
would
you
like
a
slice
of
it
yourself
blaine
a
nice
fat
juicy
slice
how
an
interested
pucker
appeared
suddenly
between
the
expressive
brows
and
carlis
laughed
oh
we
all
in
it
you
may
as
well
be
you
on
the
inside
as
it
is
the
play
got
too
high
for
rockamore
and
he
cashed
in
bluffed
old
mallowe
till
he
looking
up
sailing
dates
for
algiers
but
i
knew
you
be
sensible
when
it
came
to
the
scratch
and
divide
the
pot
rather
than
blow
your
whistle
and
have
the
game
pulled
but
it
was
old
mallowe
blaine
tone
was
puzzled
who
succeeded
in
transferring
all
that
worthless
land
he
acquired
to
lawton
when
lawton
would
come
in
and
help
him
on
that
grab
which
would
have
made
him
practically
sole
owner
of
all
the
suburban
real
estate
around
illington
was
it
sure
it
was
laughed
carlis
ponderously
but
who
made
it
possible
for
mallowe
to
palm
off
those
miles
of
vacant
lots
as
improved
city
property
of
course
on
lawton
without
his
knowledge
and
even
have
them
recorded
in
his
name
but
me
what
am
i
boss
for
if
i
do
own
a
little
man
like
the
recorder
of
deeds
i
see
blaine
tapped
his
together
and
smiled
slowly
in
meditative
appreciation
and
it
was
your
man
also
paddington
who
found
means
to
provide
the
mortgage
letter
of
appeal
for
a
loan
note
for
the
loan
itself
and
so
forth
as
for
rockamore
oh
he
fixed
up
the
dividend
end
watered
the
stock
and
kept
the
whole
thing
going
by
phony
financing
while
there
was
a
chance
of
our
hoodwinking
lawton
into
going
into
it
voluntarily
he
was
one
grand
little
promoter
rockamore
was
pity
he
got
cold
feet
and
promoted
himself
into
another
sphere
all
things
considered
it
may
not
be
such
a
pity
after
all
blaine
rose
suddenly
whirling
his
chair
about
until
it
stood
before
him
and
he
faced
his
amazed
visitor
from
across
it
now
carlis
suppose
you
promote
yourself
from
my
office
it
was
a
mere
toneless
wheeze
but
breathing
deep
of
brute
strength
i
told
you
when
you
first
came
in
that
this
promised
to
be
one
of
my
busiest
days
you
taking
up
my
time
to
be
sure
you
cleared
up
a
few
minor
points
for
me
and
testified
to
them
but
you
really
told
me
anything
i
did
know
the
game
is
up
now
get
out
he
braced
himself
as
he
spoke
to
meet
the
mountain
of
flesh
which
hurled
itself
upon
him
in
a
blind
rush
of
berserk
rage
braced
himself
met
and
countered
it
never
had
that
spacious
office
the
scene
of
so
many
heartrending
appeals
dramatic
climaxes
impassioned
confessions
and
violent
altercations
witnessed
so
terrific
a
struggle
brief
as
it
was
i
kill
you
roared
the
maddened
brute
you
never
leave
your
office
alive
to
repeat
what
i
told
i
kill
you
with
my
bare
hands
first
d
n
you
but
even
as
he
spoke
his
voice
ended
in
a
surprised
scream
of
agony
which
told
of
strained
sinews
and
ripped
tendons
and
he
fell
in
a
twisted
crumpled
heap
of
quivering
inert
flesh
at
the
feet
the
victim
of
a
scientific
hold
and
throw
which
had
not
been
included
in
his
pugilistic
education
instantly
blaine
hand
found
an
electric
bell
in
the
wall
and
almost
simultaneously
the
door
opened
and
three
powerful
figures
sprang
upon
the
huge
recumbent
form
and
bound
him
fast
take
him
away
ordered
the
detective
i
have
the
warrant
ready
for
him
warrant
for
what
spluttered
carlis
through
bruised
and
bleeding
lips
i
did
do
anything
to
you
you
attacked
me
because
i
swear
to
a
false
charge
i
got
a
legal
right
to
try
to
defend
myself
you
convicted
yourself
out
of
your
own
mouth
retorted
blaine
the
other
looked
into
his
eyes
and
quailed
but
blustered
to
the
end
nobody
heard
but
you
and
my
word
goes
in
this
town
what
mean
convicted
myself
for
answer
blaine
again
touched
that
little
spring
in
the
protruding
of
his
desk
and
out
upon
the
trenchant
stillness
broken
only
by
the
rapid
stertorous
breathing
of
the
manacled
man
burst
the
strident
tones
of
that
same
man
voice
just
as
they
had
sounded
a
few
minutes
before
the
big
money
the
money
lawton
made
by
grinding
down
the
masses
would
you
like
a
slice
of
it

for
if

what
is
it
gasped
the
wretched
carlis
in
a
fearful
whisper
when
the
voice
had
ceased
what
is
that
infernal
thing
a
detectaphone
returned
blaine
laconically
you
heard
of
them
have
you
carlis
when
you
asked
me
if
we
were
alone
if
any
of
my
operatives
were
spying
about
i
told
you
that
no
human
ear
overheard
our
conversation
but
this
little
concealed
instrument
this
unseen
listener
recorded
and
bore
witness
to
your
confession
and
this
is
a
recorder
you
do
not
own
and
can
not
buy
chapter
xx
the
crevice
but
i
do
understand
guy
morrow
voice
was
plaintive
and
he
eyed
his
chief
reproachfully
as
he
stood
before
blaine
desk
twisting
his
hat
nervously
why
you
did
nail
him
you
got
the
goods
on
him
all
right
and
now
just
because
you
only
had
him
arrested
on
a
charge
of
assault
with
intent
to
kill
he
gone
and
used
his
influence
and
got
himself
released
under
heavy
bail
oh
why
wo
you
go
heeled
or
guarded
we
ca
afford
to
lose
you
sir
any
of
us
and
now
he
do
for
you
as
sure
as
shooting
who
carlis
blaine
spoke
almost
absently
as
if
the
portentous
scene
of
two
hours
before
had
already
almost
slipped
from
his
memory
oh
he
wo
get
away
and
i
not
afraid
of
him
i
let
him
go
for
the
same
reason
that
i
did
have
mallowe
arrested
this
morning
for
the
same
reason
why
i
have
stopped
paddington
philandering
with
the
french
girl
fifine
because
a
link
is
still
missing
in
the
chain
the
shell
the
exterior
of
the
whole
conspiracy
is
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
but
i
ca
find
the
chink
the
crevice
into
which
to
insert
my
lever
and
split
it
apart
lay
the
whole
dastardly
scheme
irrefutably
open
to
the
light
of
day
i
want
to
complete
my
case
in
other
words
guy
i
want
to
win
and
you
will
sir
you
never
failed
yet
only
i
i
do
have
any
luck
the
young
man
haggard
face
grew
wistful
i
want
emily
brunell
i
need
her
and
i
seem
farther
from
finding
her
than
ever
i
did
know
that
was
your
job
the
detective
objected
with
a
brusqueness
which
was
not
unkind
i
told
you
i
take
care
of
that
in
my
own
way
i
thought
i
assigned
you
to
the
task
of
finding
out
who
fired
at
you
from
the
darkened
window
of
your
own
room
when
you
were
in
brunell
house
across
the
street
also
i
wanted
a
line
on
those
two
mysterious
boarders
of
mrs
quinlan
nothing
doing
on
either
count
sir
morrow
returned
ruefully
i
ca
get
a
glimpse
of
them
or
a
line
on
either
of
them
and
as
for
who
tried
to
plug
me
well
there
is
an
iota
of
evidence
that
i
can
discover
beyond
the
bare
fact
i
did
come
to
report
for
there
nothing
to
say
except
that
i
sticking
at
it
and
if
i
get
a
sight
of
those
two
before
long
i
going
to
burn
a
red
sulphur
light
some
fine
night
and
yell
i
bet
that
bring
the
old
codger
out
for
all
his
rheumatism
not
a
bad
idea
blaine
commented
adding
dryly
what
did
you
come
for
then
guy
to
find
out
if
you
had
any
news
you
were
willing
to
tell
me
yet
sir
of
emily
yes
the
detective
slow
smile
was
quizzical
the
most
significant
news
in
the
world
you
discovered
their
destination
hers
and
her
father
the
young
operative
cried
eagerly
you
traced
their
taxi
of
course
no
then
what
is
it
just
that
guy
that
i
have
been
able
to
trace
the
taxicab
in
which
they
left
their
house
think
it
over
report
to
me
when
got
anything
definite
to
tell
me
with
a
curt
nod
blaine
dismissed
him
but
he
glanced
after
the
dejected
retreating
figure
with
a
very
kindly
affectionate
light
in
his
fatherly
eyes
it
was
dusk
when
he
was
aroused
from
a
deep
study
of
his
carefully
annotated
résumé
of
the
case
by
the
excited
jangle
of
the
telephone
bell
to
hear
guy
morrow
no
less
excited
but
joyous
voice
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
i
found
her
i
found
emily
she
loves
me
she
does
i
made
her
listen
and
she
understands
everything
she
do
mind
a
bit
about
my
hounding
her
father
down
because
she
sees
how
it
all
had
to
be
and
the
old
man
a
regular
brick
about
it
where
it
was
the
kitten
did
it
that
blessed
caliban
and
think
of
it
sir
i
always
hated
cats
ever
since
i
was
a
kid
emily
says
but
how
maybe
if
the
hall
had
been
lighted
but
quinlan
got
that
parsimony
peculiar
to
all
landladies
and
i
trod
on
its
tail
and
it
was
all
up
morrow
are
you
a
driveling
idiot
or
an
operative
are
you
reporting
or
exploding
if
you
called
me
up
to
tell
me
that
you
trod
on
the
tail
of
your
landlady
parsimony
you
do
need
a
job
in
a
detective
bureau
you
need
a
lunacy
commission
blaine
voice
was
vexed
but
little
smiling
lines
crinkled
at
the
corners
of
his
eyes
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
am
almost
crazy
i
think
with
happiness
i
found
jimmy
brunell
and
his
daughter
they
are
the
two
mysterious
boarders
whom
quinlan
has
been
shielding
all
this
time
and
i
never
even
suspected
it
it
was
jimmy
brunell
who
fired
at
me
that
night
of
the
day
they
disappeared
he
did
recognize
me
and
thought
i
was
one
of
his
enemies
one
of
paddington
men
like
young
charley
pennold
you
remember
i
told
you
i
found
the
kitten
in
the
deserted
house
and
brought
it
home
for
quinlan
to
take
care
of
well
she
never
lights
the
gas
until
the
very
last
minute
and
late
this
afternoon
about
half
an
hour
ago
i
was
stumbling
along
the
hallway
to
my
room
in
the
dark
when
i
stepped
on
the
kitten
it
yelled
like
mad
and
emily
heard
it
from
her
room
above
forgetting
caution
and
everything
else
she
opened
the
door
and
called
it
of
course
when
i
heard
her
voice
i
was
upstairs
two
steps
at
a
time
with
the
cat
under
my
arm
clawing
like
a
vixen
she
was
perfectly
freezing
at
first
not
the
cat
it
a
he
i
mean
emily
but
after
i
explained
that
when
i
gotten
to
care
for
her
i
only
tried
to
help
her
she
oh
well
i
going
to
let
her
tell
you
herself
if
you
willing
sir
i
bring
them
both
down
to
you
now
if
you
say
so
she
and
her
father
jimmy
brunell
more
than
anxious
to
see
you
he
wants
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
affair
tell
all
he
knows
about
the
case
and
i
think
what
he
got
to
say
will
astonish
you
and
finish
the
whole
thing
crack
that
nut
you
were
talking
to
me
about
this
afternoon
provide
the
link
in
the
chain
the
crevice
in
the
crime
cube
may
i
bring
them
blaine
acquiesced
and
after
issuing
his
orders
to
the
subordinates
about
him
waited
in
a
fever
of
impatience
which
he
could
scarcely
control
and
which
had
he
stopped
to
think
of
it
would
have
astonished
him
beyond
measure
that
he
who
had
daily
almost
hourly
awaited
unmoved
the
appearance
of
men
famous
and
infamous
illustrious
and
obscure
should
so
agitatedly
view
the
coming
of
this
old
offender
was
incomprehensible
yet
although
he
had
really
learned
little
that
was
conclusive
from
guy
somewhat
incoherent
account
he
felt
in
common
with
his
young
operative
that
the
crux
of
the
matter
lay
here
to
his
hand
that
from
the
lips
of
this
old
would
fall
the
magic
word
which
would
open
to
him
the
inner
door
of
this
mystery
of
mysteries
which
would
prove
as
the
golden
key
of
truth
absolute
and
unassailable
after
what
seemed
an
incredibly
long
period
of
suspense
the
door
opened
and
marsh
ushered
them
in
morrow
his
face
wreathed
in
triumph
and
smiles
a
girl
whom
blaine
remembered
from
his
memorable
interview
with
her
at
the
anita
lawton
club
and
a
tall
grizzled
man
who
held
himself
proudly
erect
as
if
the
weight
of
years
had
fallen
from
his
shoulders
yes
sir
i
brunell
the
latter
announced
when
the
incidental
salutations
were
over
jimmy
brunell
the
forger
i
lived
straight
and
tried
to
keep
the
truth
from
my
little
girl
for
her
own
sake
but
perhaps
it
is
better
as
it
is
she
knows
everything
now
and
has
forgiven
much
because
she
a
woman
like
her
mother
god
bless
her
i
come
of
my
own
free
will
to
tell
you
all
you
want
to
know
and
prove
it
too
sit
down
all
of
you
brunell
you
forged
the
signature
to
the
mortgage
on
pennington
lawton
home
at
paddington
instigation
yes
sir
and
the
signature
on
the
note
given
for
the
loan
from
moore
and
the
whole
letter
supposed
to
be
from
lawton
to
mallowe
asking
him
to
procure
that
loan
for
him
and
all
the
other
crooked
business
which
helped
sweep
lawton
fortune
away
but
i
understand
how
big
the
job
was
nor
just
what
they
were
trying
to
put
over
or
i
would
have
done
it
i
wish
to
heaven
i
had
now
but
it
too
late
for
that
i
can
only
do
what
left
me
to
help
repair
the
damage
i
wish
i
taken
the
consequences
paddington
threatened
me
with
through
charley
pennold
curse
them
both
for
it
was
because
of
the
money
i
did
it
sir
although
what
they
offered
me
was
a
small
fortune
and
would
have
been
a
mighty
hard
temptation
in
the
old
days
it
was
because
if
i
refused
they
were
going
to
strike
at
me
through
my
little
girl
the
one
thing
on
earth
i
got
left
to
love
they
were
going
to
have
me
sent
up
on
an
old
score
which
no
one
else
even
had
suspected
i
been
mixed
up
in
i
did
know
until
just
now
when
this
young
friend
here
morrow
told
me
that
it
had
been
outlawed
long
years
ago
and
i
can
see
that
they
counted
on
my
not
knowing
how
they
found
out
about
it
anyway
is
a
mystery
to
me
but
that
paddington
is
the
devil
himself
however
if
i
did
do
the
trick
for
them
they
have
me
convicted
and
once
out
of
the
way
my
little
girl
would
be
helpless
in
their
hands
they
talked
of
sweatshops
and
worse
the
old
man
broke
down
and
shuddering
covered
his
face
with
his
thin
fingers
but
in
a
moment
before
the
pitying
outstretched
hand
of
his
daughter
could
reach
his
shoulder
he
had
regained
control
of
himself
and
resumed
i
did
what
they
asked
of
me
all
they
asked
but
i
was
suspicious
not
only
because
they
did
take
me
fully
into
their
confidence
but
because
i
knew
paddington
and
his
breed
and
also
miss
lawton
had
been
kind
to
my
little
girl
if
they
meant
any
harm
to
pennington
lawton
daughter
or
if
their
scheme
whatever
kind
of
a
it
was
failed
to
pan
out
as
they
expected
and
they
tried
to
make
me
the
well
i
meant
to
protect
myself
and
lawton
my
word
would
have
to
be
proof
against
theirs
that
they
forced
me
into
what
i
did
but
i
could
fix
it
so
that
i
could
prove
to
anybody
without
any
doubt
that
lawton
never
wrote
that
note
to
mallowe
from
long
bay
about
that
loan
two
years
ago
and
that
would
sort
of
substantiate
my
word
that
the
signatures
were
his
either
how
could
you
prove
such
a
thing
blaine
leaned
forward
tensely
young
morrow
here
tells
me
that
you
got
that
note
the
note
asking
mallowe
to
arrange
the
loan
for
lawton
will
you
get
it
please
sir
i
do
want
to
see
it
i
want
you
to
read
it
to
me
and
then
i
tell
you
something
about
it
they
thought
they
were
clever
the
rascals
but
i
fooled
them
at
their
own
game
i
cut
out
the
words
from
a
bundle
of
lawton
old
letters
which
they
gave
me
and
i
manufactured
the
note
all
right
i
did
it
word
for
word
just
like
they
wanted
me
to
but
i
put
my
private
on
it
that
they
could
discover
so
that
i
could
prove
anywhere
any
time
that
it
was
a
forgery
in
a
concealed
fever
of
excitement
the
detective
produced
the
fateful
note
from
his
private
file
that
looks
like
it
chuckled
old
jimmy
it
dated
august
sixteenth
nineteen
hundred
and
twelve
is
it
now
sir
will
you
read
it
out
loud
please
blaine
unfolded
the
single
sheet
of
hotel
and
looked
once
more
at
the
following
message
my
dear
mallowe
kindly
regard
this
letter
as
strictly
confidential
i
desire
to
negotiate
a
private
loan
immediately
for
a
considerable
amount
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
fact
but
for
obvious
reasons
which
you
as
a
man
of
discretion
and
financial
astuteness
second
to
none
in
this
country
will
readily
understand
a
public
assumption
of
it
by
me
would
be
disastrous
to
a
degree
under
the
prevailing
conditions
ask
moore
if
he
can
arrange
the
matter
for
me
but
feel
him
out
tentatively
first
if
he
does
not
see
his
way
clear
to
it
let
me
know
without
delay
and
i
will
come
to
illington
and
confer
with
you
i
am
prepared
of
course
to
give
him
my
personal
note
for
same
but
do
not
desire
any
direct
dealings
with
him
in
fact
it
would
be
exceedingly
dangerous
to
my
interests
if
he
ever
mentioned
it
to
me
personally
even
when
he
fancied
himself
alone
with
me
impress
this
upon
him
i
will
pay
far
above
the
legal
rate
of
interest
of
course
you
can
arrange
this
with
him
i
will
go
into
the
whole
matter
of
this
contingency
confidentially
with
you
when
i
see
you
in
the
meantime
i
know
that
i
can
rely
upon
you
awaiting
the
earliest
possible
reply
and
thanking
you
for
the
interest
i
know
you
will
take
in
this
affair
sincerely
your
friend
pennington
lawton
after
glancing
at
it
a
moment
blaine
read
the
letter
aloud
in
a
calm
unemotional
voice
which
gave
no
hint
of
the
tumult
within
him
he
had
scarcely
finished
when
jimmy
brunell
greatly
excited
interrupted
triumphantly
that
it
that
the
note
do
see
anything
phony
about
it
do
you
sir
neither
did
they
now
leave
out
the
dear
mallowe
and
beginning
with
the
next
as
the
first
line
count
down
five
lines
the
last
letter
of
the
last
word
on
that
line
is
omit
a
line
and
take
the
last
letter
of
the
next
and
so
on
for
four
letters
that
is
the
last
words
of
the
four
alternate
lines
beginning
with
the
fifth
from
the
top
are
and
and
the
last
letters
of
those
four
spell
a
word
that
word
is
and
so
is
the
note
and
the
whole
infernal
business
from
beginning
to
end
i
put
my
mark
on
it
sir
so
it
could
be
known
for
what
it
is
in
case
of
need
now
the
need
has
come
by
jove
so
it
is
guy
morrow
cried
unable
to
restrain
himself
longer
you
a
wonder
mr
brunell
you
have
rendered
us
a
greater
service
than
you
know
supplemented
blaine
the
while
his
pulses
throbbed
in
time
to
his
leaping
heart
the
crevice
the
rift
in
the
criminal
almost
perfected
scheme
into
which
he
had
succeeded
in
inserting
the
little
silver
probe
of
his
specialized
knowledge
and
disclosed
to
a
gaping
world
the
truth
he
had
found
it
at
last
and
his
work
was
all
but
done
but
what
to
happen
to
me
now
the
exultation
had
died
out
of
his
voice
and
jimmy
brunell
looked
suddenly
pinched
and
gray
and
tired
and
very
very
old
i
do
care
much
what
happens
to
me
but
my
daughter
emily
i
take
care
of
her
whatever
happens
guy
heart
was
in
his
buoyant
voice
but
you
be
all
right
do
you
worry
have
you
got
blaine
on
your
side
i
try
to
see
that
you
do
suffer
for
your
enforced
share
in
the
lawton
conspiracy
brunell
it
seems
to
me
that
you
already
gone
through
trouble
enough
on
that
score
great
as
was
the
damage
you
wrought
blaine
remarked
reassuringly
adding
but
why
did
you
come
forward
before
and
give
your
testimony
there
was
any
court
action
the
old
man
returned
hesitatingly
and
besides
i
was
afraid
to
come
forward
and
tell
what
i
knew
because
of
emily
i
would
have
done
it
though
as
soon
as
i
learned
they
had
robbed
miss
lawton
of
everything
i
was
sure
of
that
you
see
one
thing
more
blaine
pressed
the
bell
which
would
summon
his
secretary
why
if
you
had
reformed
did
you
keep
in
your
possession
all
these
years
your
forging
apparatus
i
had
it
taken
care
of
for
me
while
i
served
my
term
meaning
to
use
it
again
when
i
came
out
i
was
bitter
and
revengeful
and
i
meant
to
do
everybody
up
brown
that
i
could
but
when
i
was
free
and
found
my
my
wife
had
gone
and
left
me
emily
it
seemed
like
a
hostage
from
her
gentle
spirit
given
to
the
world
that
i
would
do
any
more
wrong
i
kept
the
plant
because
i
did
know
how
to
dispose
of
it
so
no
one
else
could
use
it
and
as
the
years
went
by
i
got
more
and
more
scared
at
the
thought
of
it
i
was
afraid
both
ways
afraid
it
would
be
discovered
but
more
afraid
i
be
found
out
if
i
tried
to
get
rid
of
it
so
i
buried
it
in
the
cellar
of
my
little
shop
and
did
my
level
best
to
forget
it
almost
succeeded
when
god
knows
how
paddington
found
me
you
know
the
rest
you
rang
sir
marsh
the
secretary
had
entered
noiselessly
yes
have
these
two
people
this
young
lady
and
her
father
conducted
in
my
own
limousine
to
my
house
and
made
comfortable
there
until
i
give
you
further
directions
as
to
what
i
wish
done
concerning
them
blaine
cut
short
the
old
forger
broken
words
of
gratitude
in
his
brusquely
kind
fashion
but
his
heart
imaged
always
the
light
in
the
girl
soft
eyes
as
she
bent
a
parting
glance
upon
him
like
a
benediction
before
the
door
closed
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
sir
young
morrow
asked
anxiously
when
they
were
alone
henry
blaine
paused
a
moment
before
replying
i
might
let
him
take
his
chance
before
the
court
on
the
strength
of
his
years
and
his
having
turned
state
evidence
voluntarily
guy
but
he
an
old
offender
and
carlis
faction
is
strong
my
racing
car
will
make
ninety
miles
an
hour
easily
and
it
can
do
it
unmolested
with
my
private
sign
on
the
hood
it
can
meet
the
canadian
express
at
branchtown
at
dawn
i
a
little
farm
in
a
nice
community
in
canada
not
too
isolated
and
i
going
to
make
it
over
to
you
as
part
of
your
reward
for
your
work
on
the
lawton
case
no
do
thank
me
i
sworn
on
the
side
of
law
and
order
but
justice
is
stern
and
sometimes
blind
because
she
will
not
see
remember
the
greatest
jurist
himself
recommended
mercy
soon
afterward
as
they
sat
discussing
the
of
the
case
the
subject
of
the
second
set
of
cryptograms
was
broached
and
blaine
smiled
at
morrow
utter
bewilderment
concerning
them
still
puzzling
about
those
guy
they
were
as
simple
as
the
first
one
was
that
of
the
system
of
characters
and
dots
the
later
ones
were
the
more
difficult
because
they
were
of
no
set
system
at
all
i
mean
no
one
system
but
a
primitive
conglomeration
probably
evolved
by
paddington
himself
based
on
script
music
and
also
the
old
childish
trick
of
writing
letters
shaped
like
figures
which
can
be
read
by
reversing
the
paper
and
holding
it
up
to
the
light
just
a
minute
and
we
look
at
the
two
notes
the
one
you
found
in
brunell
room
in
the
deserted
cottage
and
the
other
which
came
to
me
in
the
cigarette
box
meant
for
paddington
from
mac
alarney
then
we
be
able
to
see
how
they
were
worked
out
and
you
see
that
though
they
look
extremely
meaningless
and
confusing
they
are
in
reality
extremely
simple
as
he
spoke
blaine
produced
them
from
his
desk
drawer
and
spread
them
out
before
him
before
you
examine
them
he
went
on
let
me
explain
the
musical
script
idea
on
which
they
are
fundamentally
based
in
case
you
are
unfamiliar
with
it
the
sign
before
a
bar
of
music
means
that
music
is
written
in
the
treble
clef
that
is
all
the
notes
following
it
are
above
the
central
on
the
piano
keyboard
thus
here
he
drew
rapidly
on
a
scrap
of
paper
and
passed
a
scrawled
scale
over
to
the
interested
operative
illustration
an
image
of
a
music
scale
diagram
is
shown
here
in
the
text
the
dot
on
the
line
below
the
five
lines
which
are
joined
together
by
the
sign
of
the
treble
clef
is
the
dot
on
the
space
between
that
and
the
first
of
the
five
lines
is
the
dot
on
the
first
line
is
on
the
next
space
is
and
so
forth
in
their
alphabetical
order
on
the
alternating
lines
and
spaces
do
you
see
how
easily
they
could
be
used
as
the
letters
of
words
in
a
cryptogram
by
any
one
of
an
ingenious
turn
of
mind
of
course
each
bar
that
is
each
section
enclosed
by
lines
running
straight
up
and
down
represents
a
word
now
for
the
rest
of
it
leaving
the
script
music
idea
aside
and
taking
the
characters
not
so
represented
in
the
cryptogram
we
find
that
when
viewed
from
the
under
side
of
the
paper
will
look
very
much
like
an
english
like
like
like
and
so
forth
try
it
here
is
the
first
note
the
one
you
found
puzzle
out
the
musical
notes
by
their
alphabetical
nomenclature
from
the
key
i
just
gave
you
on
the
scrap
of
paper
there
then
hold
the
note
up
to
the
light
and
read
the
other
letters
from
the
under
side
try
it
with
both
notes
and
tell
me
what
you
find
guy
took
the
papers
and
wonderingly
spelled
out
the
letters
represented
by
the
musical
notes
from
the
scale
blaine
had
given
him
then
turning
the
pages
over
he
held
them
up
to
the
light
an
exclamation
of
absorbed
interest
escaping
from
him
the
great
detective
watched
him
in
silence
until
at
last
with
a
glowing
sense
of
achievement
guy
read
it
at
once
you
are
suspected
detective
on
trail
rite
old
address
i
am
sending
funds
as
usual
if
caught
you
get
life
sentence
pad
blaine
nodded
now
the
other
still
unconscious
consultation
necessary
at
once
to
save
life
should
he
die
advise
reddy
what
disposition
to
make
of
body
mac
the
last
cryptogram
proved
the
more
easily
decipherable
and
when
the
young
operative
had
read
it
aloud
he
looked
up
with
a
glowing
face
by
george
it
a
what
put
you
on
the
right
track
the
last
one
i
realized
then
that
they
were
afraid
the
kidnaped
man
ramon
hamilton
who
had
been
grievously
wounded
would
die
on
their
hands
and
that
rather
than
face
the
results
of
such
a
contingency
they
would
attempt
to
obtain
some
obscure
but
experienced
medical
aid
and
in
a
way
which
would
give
the
physician
no
inkling
of
his
patient
identity
or
whereabouts
i
therefore
sent
out
that
circular
letter
to
every
doctor
in
illington
warning
each
one
to
come
to
me
in
the
event
of
his
having
received
a
mysterious
summons
it
worked
as
you
know
and
doctor
alwyn
responded
well
if
you
had
been
able
to
read
the
cryptogram
sir
the
lord
knows
what
would
have
happened
and
if
you
had
trodden
on
the
cat
tail
blaine
suggested
dryly
illustration
an
image
of
a
coded
message
is
shown
here
in
the
text
guy
glanced
at
him
in
sudden
swift
comprehension
why
look
here
sir
i
believe
you
knew
that
emily
and
her
father
were
the
two
mysterious
boarders
at
quinlan
all
the
time
you
said
it
was
significant
that
you
had
been
able
to
trace
the
number
of
the
taxicab
in
which
they
had
run
away
from
the
neighborhood
there
never
was
a
taxicab
in
all
illington
which
could
be
traced
by
its
number
you
knew
of
course
that
that
story
of
quinlan
was
a
fake
and
then
when
i
told
you
of
the
two
concealed
people
there
you
had
it
all
doped
out
oh
why
did
you
tell
me
because
i
did
want
you
to
precipitate
matters
just
then
guy
the
detective
responded
kindly
the
house
was
watched
they
could
get
away
that
a
good
one
young
morrow
looked
his
hire
operatives
on
your
staff
sir
and
then
have
to
set
others
to
tail
them
and
see
that
they
do
get
into
trouble
heavens
what
an
idiot
i
am
i
found
out
one
thing
though
from
those
cryptograms
he
pointed
to
the
cipher
notes
on
the
desk
music
a
cinch
i
can
read
it
already
and
i
going
to
start
in
and
learn
how
to
play
on
something
or
other
the
first
chance
i
get
there
a
fellow
next
door
to
quinlan
with
a
clarinet
he
paused
and
his
face
sobered
as
he
added
but
i
forgot
i
be
there
any
more
before
blaine
could
speak
there
was
a
knock
upon
the
door
and
marsh
entered
with
hurried
circumspection
there
was
a
look
of
latent
shocked
importance
upon
his
usually
impassive
face
and
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
newspaper
which
was
still
damp
from
the
press
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
i
thought
you
would
want
to
know
at
once
there
been
a
murder
paddington
the
private
detective
was
found
in
the
rhododendron
alley
just
off
the
mall
in
the
park
stabbed
to
the
heart
henry
blaine
took
the
paper
and
spread
it
out
upon
the
desk
before
him
as
guy
morrow
with
a
soft
low
whistle
turned
away
the
extra
imparted
little
more
than
the
secretary
announcement
had
done
there
was
no
known
motive
for
the
crime
no
clue
to
the
murderer
when
found
the
man
had
been
dead
for
some
hours
well
sir
observed
guy
at
last
when
the
secretary
had
withdrawn
one
by
one
they
getting
away
from
us
and
by
the
same
route
first
rockamore
now
paddington
blaine
looked
up
with
a
grim
smile
putting
a
woman
wise
to
anything
is
like
lighting
a
faulty
you
never
can
tell
when
you
going
to
get
your
own
fingers
blown
off
but
tell
me
something
guy
what
was
that
tune
you
whistled
a
moment
ago
when
marsh
came
in
with
the
news
it
had
a
vaguely
familiar
ring
oh
that
asked
the
operative
with
a
sheepishly
guileless
air
it
was
just
a
bit
from
an
english
musical
comedy
of
two
or
three
years
back
i
think
it
got
a
name
something
like
a
boat
sails
on
saturday
blaine
wry
smile
broadened
to
a
grin
of
genuine
appreciation
and
rising
he
clapped
the
young
man
heartily
on
the
shoulder
right
you
are
guy
and
it
wo
be
our
job
to
search
the
sailing
lists
you
may
not
always
be
able
to
see
what
lies
under
your
nose
but
your
perspective
is
not
bad
hell
has
only
one
fury
worse
than
a
woman
scorned
that
i
know
of
and
that
is
a
woman
fooled
we
let
it
go
at
that
the
evening
had
already
grown
late
but
that
eventful
day
was
not
to
end
without
one
more
brief
scene
of
vital
import
marsh
presently
reappeared
this
time
bearing
a
card
mallowe
read
blaine
with
a
show
him
in
marsh
and
have
your
men
ready
you
know
what
to
do
no
guy
you
need
go
this
interview
will
not
be
a
private
one
mr
blaine
mallowe
entered
pompously
and
then
paused
glancing
rather
uncertainly
from
the
detective
to
morrow
it
needed
no
keen
observer
to
note
the
change
in
the
man
since
the
scene
of
that
morning
at
miss
lawton
he
had
become
a
mere
shell
of
his
former
self
the
smug
unctuousness
was
gone
the
jaunty
drooped
his
skin
fell
in
flabby
folds
and
his
crafty
eyes
shifted
like
a
hunted
animal
blaine
i
had
hoped
for
a
strictly
confidential
conference
with
you
but
i
presume
this
person
to
be
one
of
your
trusted
assistants
and
it
is
immaterial
now
the
matter
upon
which
i
have
come
is
too
pressing
scandal
notoriety
must
be
averted
at
all
costs
i
find
that
a
frightful
a
hideous
mistake
has
been
made
and
i
am
actually
upon
the
point
of
being
involved
in
a
conspiracy
as
terrible
as
that
of
which
my
poor
friend
pennington
lawton
was
the
victim
and
i
am
as
innocent
as
he
i
swear
it
you
may
as
well
conserve
your
strength
and
your
strategic
ingenuity
for
the
immediate
future
mallowe
you
need
both
blaine
returned
coolly
if
you
come
here
to
make
any
appeal
i
come
to
assert
my
innocence
the
broken
man
cried
with
a
flash
of
his
old
proud
dignity
i
only
learned
this
evening
of
the
truth
and
that
those
scoundrels
carlis
and
rockamore
had
implicated
me
how
a
man
of
your
discernment
and
experience
could
believe
for
a
moment
that
i
was
a
party
to
any
fraudulent
blaine
pressed
the
bell
there
is
no
use
in
prolonging
this
interview
mr
mallowe
he
said
curtly
all
the
evidence
is
in
my
hands
but
allow
me
to
explain
the
flabby
face
grew
more
deathlike
until
the
burning
eyes
seemed
peering
from
the
face
of
a
corpse
two
men
entered
and
at
sight
of
them
the
former
pompous
president
of
the
street
railways
of
illington
plumped
to
his
fat
quaking
knees
for
god
sake
listen
you
must
listen
blaine
he
shrieked
i
am
one
of
the
prominent
men
of
this
country
i
have
three
married
daughters
two
of
them
with
small
children
the
disgrace
the
infamy
of
this
will
kill
them
i
will
make
restitution
i
will
pennington
lawton
had
one
daughter
unmarried
unprovided
for
did
you
think
of
asked
blaine
grimly
i
sorry
for
the
innocent
who
must
suffer
with
you
mallowe
but
in
this
instance
the
law
must
take
its
course
lead
him
away
when
the
wailing
quavering
voice
had
subsided
behind
the
closing
door
henry
blaine
turned
to
young
morrow
with
a
weary
look
of
pain
in
his
eyes
unpleasant
was
it
he
asked
grimly
i
try
to
school
myself
against
it
but
with
all
my
experience
a
scene
like
this
makes
me
sick
at
heart
i
know
the
wretch
deserves
what
is
coming
to
him
just
as
rockamore
knew
when
he
unfalteringly
sped
that
bullet
just
as
carlis
knew
when
he
heard
his
own
voice
repeated
by
the
dictagraph
and
yet
i
who
make
my
living
and
shall
continue
to
make
it
by
unearthing
malefactors
i
who
have
built
my
career
made
my
reputation
proved
myself
to
be
what
i
am
by
the
detection
and
punishment
of
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
before
god
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
crime
in
all
this
fair
green
world
chapter
xxi
cleared
skies
just
as
in
autumn
the
period
of
indian
summer
brings
a
reminiscent
warmth
and
sunshine
so
sometimes
in
late
winter
a
day
will
come
now
and
then
which
is
a
harbinger
of
the
not
springtide
like
a
promise
during
present
storm
and
stress
of
better
things
to
come
such
a
day
balmy
and
gloriously
bright
found
four
people
seated
together
in
the
spacious
sunny
of
a
great
house
on
belleair
avenue
a
young
man
pale
and
wan
as
from
a
long
illness
but
with
a
new
steadiness
and
clarity
born
of
suffering
in
his
eyes
a
girl
slender
and
her
delicate
face
flushing
with
an
exquisite
color
her
eyes
soft
and
misty
and
too
in
their
starry
fulfillment
of
love
that
has
been
tried
and
found
another
figure
but
clerically
frocked
and
portly
and
the
last
a
man
approaching
a
man
with
sandy
hair
and
a
mustache
just
slightly
tinged
with
gray
he
might
from
his
appearance
and
bearing
have
been
a
great
teacher
a
great
philanthropist
a
great
statesman
but
he
was
none
of
these
or
rather
let
us
say
he
was
all
and
more
he
was
the
greatest
factor
for
good
which
the
age
had
produced
because
he
was
the
greatest
instrument
of
justice
the
of
the
century
the
pale
young
man
moved
a
little
in
his
chair
and
the
girl
laid
her
hand
caressingly
upon
his
one
she
was
seated
close
to
him
in
fact
anita
was
never
willing
in
these
later
days
to
be
so
far
from
ramon
that
she
could
not
reach
out
and
touch
him
as
if
to
assure
herself
that
he
was
there
that
he
was
safe
from
the
enemies
who
had
encompassed
them
both
and
that
her
ministering
care
might
shield
him
doctor
franklin
noted
the
movement
slight
as
it
was
and
cleared
his
throat
importantly
of
course
my
dear
children
he
began
impressively
if
it
is
your
earnest
desire
i
will
perform
the
marriage
ceremony
for
you
here
in
this
room
at
noon
but
i
trust
you
have
both
given
the
matter
careful
thought
not
of
course
as
to
the
suitability
of
your
union
but
the
i
may
say
the
manner
of
it
a
ceremony
without
a
social
function
without
the
customary
observances
which
although
worldly
and
filled
with
pomp
and
vanity
nevertheless
are
befitted
by
usage
in
these
mundane
days
to
those
of
your
station
in
life
seems
slightly
unconventional
almost
er
unseemly
but
we
do
care
for
the
pomp
and
vanity
and
the
social
observances
and
all
the
rest
of
it
do
we
ramon
the
girl
asked
ramon
hamilton
smiled
and
his
eyes
met
and
held
hers
we
only
want
each
other
he
said
quietly
but
it
seems
so
very
precipitate
the
clergyman
urged
turning
as
if
for
moral
support
to
the
impassive
figure
of
henry
blaine
so
soon
after
the
shadow
of
tragedy
has
crossed
this
threshold
what
will
people
say
a
little
vagrant
breeze
like
a
lost
unseasonable
butterfly
came
in
at
the
open
window
and
stirred
the
filmy
curtain
bearing
on
its
soft
breath
the
odor
of
narcissus
from
the
oh
doctor
franklin
cried
the
girl
impulsively
do
talk
of
tragedy
just
now
spring
is
so
near
and
we
love
each
other
so
if
he
my
dear
dead
father
can
hear
he
will
understand
and
wish
it
to
be
so
as
you
will
the
minister
rose
i
gave
you
your
name
anita
i
consecrated
your
father
soul
to
heaven
and
his
body
to
the
dust
and
i
will
give
his
daughter
in
marriage
to
the
man
he
chose
for
her
protector
whenever
it
is
your
will
but
blaine
what
do
you
say
you
seem
to
have
more
influence
over
miss
lawton
than
i
although
i
can
scarcely
understand
it
do
you
agree
with
me
that
the
world
will
talk
i
do
responded
henry
blaine
fervently
and
i
say
let
it
it
can
say
of
these
two
children
only
what
i
do
bless
you
both
sorrow
and
suffering
and
tragedy
have
taken
their
quota
of
these
young
lives
now
let
a
little
happiness
and
joy
and
sunshine
and
love
in
upon
the
circumspect
gloom
you
would
still
cast
about
them
you
ministers
are
steeped
in
the
spiritual
misery
of
the
world
the
doctors
in
the
physical
but
we
are
forced
to
drink
of
it
to
its
dregs
physical
mental
moral
spiritual
and
there
is
so
much
in
this
tainted
world
of
ours
that
is
beautiful
and
pure
and
happy
and
holy
if
we
will
but
give
it
a
chance
doctor
franklin
coughed
in
a
severely
condemnatory
fashion
now
that
i
have
learned
your
opinion
in
a
broad
general
way
blaine
i
can
understand
your
point
of
view
in
regard
to
that
young
criminal
charles
pennold
when
at
the
time
of
the
trial
you
used
your
influence
to
have
him
paroled
in
your
custody
instead
of
being
sent
to
prison
where
he
belonged
exactly
blaine
tone
was
dry
i
firmly
believe
that
there
are
many
more
young
boys
and
men
in
our
prisons
who
should
in
reality
be
in
hospitals
or
in
sheltering
uplifting
sympathetic
hands
than
there
are
criminals
unpunished
and
you
with
your
broadly
professionally
charitable
point
of
view
doctor
he
added
with
keen
enjoyment
will
i
am
convinced
be
delighted
to
know
that
charley
pennold
is
doing
splendidly
he
will
develop
in
time
into
one
of
my
most
trusted
capable
operatives
i
have
no
doubt
he
has
the
instinct
the
real
nose
for
crime
but
circumstances
from
his
birth
and
even
before
that
forced
him
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
fence
he
was
if
you
will
pardon
the
vernacular
on
the
outside
looking
in
now
he
on
the
inside
looking
out
i
sincerely
trust
so
the
minister
responded
frigidly
and
turned
to
the
others
i
will
leave
you
now
if
it
is
your
irrevocable
desire
to
have
the
ceremony
at
noon
i
will
make
all
the
necessary
arrangements
in
fact
i
will
telephone
you
later
when
everything
is
settled
oh
thank
you
franklin
i
knew
you
would
fail
us
anita
murmured
do
forget
to
tell
franklin
that
she
will
hear
from
me
she
must
surely
come
you
know
when
the
door
had
closed
on
the
minister
broad
retreating
back
ramon
hamilton
turned
with
a
suspicion
of
a
flush
in
his
wan
cheeks
to
the
detective
if
i
gone
to
any
sunday
school
he
presided
over
when
i
was
a
kiddie
i
have
been
a
now
he
observed
darkly
glad
you
lit
into
him
about
young
pennold
blaine
he
started
it
but
think
of
the
others
anita
lawton
turned
her
face
for
a
moment
to
the
day
outside
mallowe
dead
in
his
cell
from
apoplexy
carlis
imprisoned
for
life
mac
alarney
and
all
the
rest
facing
long
years
behind
gray
walls
and
iron
bars
oh
i
know
it
is
just
i
remember
what
they
did
to
my
father
and
to
me
and
yet
somehow
in
this
glorious
sunshine
and
with
all
the
ages
and
ages
just
as
bright
spreading
before
me
i
can
find
charity
and
mercy
in
my
heart
for
all
the
world
charity
and
mercy
repeated
ramon
soberly
yes
dearest
but
not
liberty
to
continue
their
crimes
to
do
to
others
what
they
did
to
us
a
spasm
of
pain
crossed
his
face
and
she
bent
over
him
solicitously
oh
what
is
it
ramon
speak
to
me
nothing
dear
it
all
right
now
just
a
twinge
of
the
old
pain
those
murdering
fiends
who
made
you
suffer
so
she
cried
and
added
with
feminine
illogicality
i
sorry
after
all
that
in
prison
i
glad
they
got
their
just
deserts
oh
ramon
been
afraid
to
distress
you
by
asking
you
but
did
you
tell
the
truth
at
the
trial
all
the
truth
i
mean
was
that
really
all
you
remember
yes
dear
he
replied
a
trifle
wearily
when
i
left
office
that
day
i
was
hurrying
along
dalrymple
street
when
just
outside
the
colossus
building
a
boy
about
fifteen
that
one
who
is
in
the
reformatory
now
collided
with
me
then
he
looked
up
into
my
face
and
grasped
my
arm
hamilton
are
you
he
gasped
come
quick
sir
ferrand
had
a
stroke
or
something
and
i
was
just
running
to
get
help
you
do
remember
me
i
guess
i
ferrand
new
frankie
allen
you
was
in
to
see
him
about
ten
days
ago
do
you
remember
well
as
i
told
you
dearest
old
ferrand
was
one
of
my
father
best
friends
his
offices
were
in
the
colossus
building
and
i
been
in
to
see
him
about
ten
days
before
so
in
spite
of
blaine
warning
i
was
perfectly
unsuspecting
of
course
i
remember
his
from
adam
but
that
fact
never
occurred
to
me
then
i
went
right
along
with
the
boy
and
he
talked
so
volubly
that
i
did
notice
we
had
gotten
into
the
wrong
elevator
the
express
until
its
first
stop
seven
floors
above
ferrand
they
must
have
staged
the
whole
thing
pretty
well
carlis
and
paddington
and
their
crew
for
when
i
stepped
out
of
the
express
elevator
there
was
no
one
in
sight
that
i
remember
but
the
boy
who
was
with
me
i
pressed
the
button
of
the
local
which
was
just
beside
the
express
there
was
a
buzz
and
whirring
hum
as
if
the
elevator
had
ascended
and
the
door
opened
as
i
stepped
over
its
threshold
i
felt
a
violent
blow
and
terrific
pain
on
the
back
of
my
head
and
seemed
to
fall
into
limitless
space
that
was
all
i
knew
until
i
woke
up
in
the
hospital
where
blaine
had
taken
me
after
discovering
and
rescuing
me
to
see
your
dear
face
bending
over
mine
one
of
paddington
men
was
waiting
and
hit
you
on
the
head
with
a
as
you
stepped
into
the
open
elevator
shaft
blaine
supplemented
it
was
all
a
plant
of
course
you
only
fell
to
the
roof
of
the
elevator
which
was
on
a
level
with
the
floor
below
there
they
carried
you
into
the
office
of
a
fake
company
kept
you
until
closing
time
and
got
you
out
of
the
building
as
a
drunkard
conveying
you
to
mac
alarney
retreat
in
his
own
machine
nobody
employed
in
the
building
was
in
their
pay
but
the
elevator
man
and
he
got
his
along
with
the
rest
paddington
scheme
was
bad
if
he
only
been
on
the
square
he
might
have
made
a
very
brilliant
detective
how
terrible
his
death
was
anita
shuddered
and
how
unexplainable
no
one
ever
found
out
who
stabbed
him
there
in
the
park
did
they
blaine
did
not
reply
he
knew
that
on
the
day
following
the
discovery
of
the
murdered
man
one
franchette
durand
otherwise
fifine
déchaussée
had
sailed
for
havre
on
the
which
had
gone
to
the
bottom
in
with
all
on
board
he
knew
also
that
an
hour
before
the
french
girl
last
tragic
interview
with
paddington
she
had
discovered
the
existence
of
his
wife
for
he
himself
had
seen
to
it
that
the
knowledge
was
imparted
to
her
further
than
that
he
preferred
not
to
conjecture
the
girl
had
taken
her
secret
with
her
to
her
swiftly
retributive
grave
in
the
deep
blaine
rose
somewhat
reluctantly
work
called
him
and
yet
he
loved
to
be
near
them
in
the
high
noon
of
their
happiness
i
be
on
hand
indeed
i
will
he
promised
heartily
in
response
to
their
eager
request
just
think
anita
buried
her
glowing
face
in
her
shoulder
for
an
instant
and
then
looked
up
with
misty
eyes
just
think
if
it
had
been
for
you
blaine
there
would
be
any
i
do
mean
about
your
getting
my
father
money
all
back
for
me
i
grateful
of
course
but
it
does
count
beside
the
greater
thing
you
have
given
us
but
for
you
there
would
have
been
any
that
true
the
young
man
arm
encircled
the
girl
slender
waist
as
they
stood
together
in
the
glowing
sunlight
but
his
other
hand
gripped
the
detective
we
owe
life
our
happiness
the
future
everything
to
you
and
so
henry
blaine
left
them
at
the
door
he
turned
and
glanced
back
and
the
sight
his
eyes
beheld
was
a
goodly
one
for
him
to
carry
away
with
him
into
the
world
a
sight
as
old
as
the
ages
as
new
as
the
hour
as
prescient
as
the
hours
and
ages
to
come
just
a
man
and
a
maid
sunshine
and
happiness
youth
and
love
that
and
the
light
of
undying
gratitude

the
eyes
they
bent
