feel
like
a

this
i
thought
was
adding
insult
to
injury
mother
kept
screaming
through
the
wire
about
my
underwear
a
bill
from
a
restaurant
for
worth
of
past
luncheons
he
missed
the
dirty
whites
but
i
will
never
be
the
same
fire

this
is
designed
to
give
us
physical
poise
liberty
party
of
course
i
played
the
game
no
more
she
was
greatly
delighted
with
the
i
was
so
very
wrong
just
the
slight
difference
between
port
and
present
arms
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
mix
poor
dear
grandfather
a
drink
i
was
tempted
to
shoot
the
cartridge
out
just
to
make
it
lighter
one
fourth
of
the
entire
pelham
field
artillery
passed
over
my
body
the
procedure
of
course
did
not
go
unnoticed
this
war
is
going
to
put
a
lot
of
chinamen
out
of
business
i
stood
thus
decreasing
the
possible
area
of
danger
i
a
sailor
man
who
is
doing
the
best
he
can
to
keep
clean
i
took
him
around
and
introduced
him
to
the
rest
of
the
dogs
and
several
of
the
better
sort
of
goats
i
resumed
my
slumber
but
not
with
much
comfort
i
lost
completely
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
men
fogerty
came
bearing
down
on
me
in
a
cloud
of
dust
for
the
most
part
however
he
sat
quietly
on
my
lap
and
sniffed
i
carried
all
the
flour
that
was
raised
last
year
in
the
southern
section
of
the
state
of
montana
said
tony
thought
this
was
a
restaurant
would
still
remain
in
a
dense
fog
i
gasped
in
a
low
voice
i
came
in
and
i
go
out
biltmore
oswald
diary
of
a
hapless
and
what
asked
the
enlisting
officer
regarding
me
as
if
i
had
insulted
him
his
family
and
his
live
stock
leads
you
to
believe
that
you
are
remotely
qualified
to
join
the
navy
at
this
i
almost
dropped
my
cane
which
in
the
stress
of
my
patriotic
preoccupation
i
had
forgotten
to
leave
home
nothing
i
replied
making
a
hasty
calculation
of
my
numerous
useless
accomplishments
nothing
at
all
sir
that
is
nothing
to
speak
of
of
course
i
passed
a
couple
of
seasons
at
bar
harbor
perhaps
that
bar
harbor
exploded
the
officer
bar
bah
bah
dammit
he
broke
off
i
bleating
yes
sir
said
i
with
becoming
humility
his
hostility
increased
do
you
enlist
for
foreign
service
he
snapped
sure
i
replied
it
will
all
be
foreign
to
me
the
long
line
of
expectant
recruits
began
to
close
in
upon
us
until
a
thirsty
ingratiating
was
formed
around
the
desk
upon
the
multitude
he
glared
bitterly
orderly
why
ca
you
keep
this
line
in
some
sort
of
shape
yes
give
the
old
tosh
some
air
breathed
a
worthy
in
my
ear
as
he
retreated
to
his
proper
place
what
did
you
do
at
bar
harbor
asked
the
officer
fixing
me
with
his
gaze
oh
i
replied
easily
i
occasionally
yachted
on
what
kind
of
a
boat
he
urged
now
for
the
life
of
me
sir
i
ca
quite
recall
i
replied
it
was
a
splendid
boat
though
a
perfect
beauty
handsomely
fitted
up
and
all
i
think
they
called
her
the
wing
these
few
little
remarks
seemed
to
leave
the
officer
flat
he
regarded
me
with
a
pitiful
expression
there
was
pain
in
his
eyes
you
mean
to
say
he
whispered
that
you
do
know
what
kind
of
a
boat
it
was
unfortunately
no
sir
i
replied
feeling
really
sorry
for
the
wounded
man
do
you
recall
what
was
the
nature
of
your
activities
aboard
this
mysterious
craft
he
continued
oh
indeed
i
do
sir
i
replied
i
tended
the
ah
said
he
thoughtfully
sort
of
specialized
on
the
that
it
sir
said
i
feeling
things
taking
a
turn
for
the
better
i
specialized
on
the
what
did
you
do
to
this
he
continued
i
clewed
it
said
i
promptly
dimly
recalling
the
impassioned
instructions
an
enthusiastic
friend
of
mine
had
shunted
at
me
throughout
the
course
of
one
long
hot
horrible
confused
afternoon
of
the
past
summer
my
first
and
as
i
had
hoped
at
the
time
final
sailing
experience
the
officer
seemed
to
be
lost
in
reflection
he
was
probably
weighing
my
last
answer
then
with
a
heavy
sigh
he
took
my
paper
and
wrote
something
mysterious
upon
it
i
going
to
make
an
experiment
of
you
he
said
holding
the
paper
to
me
you
are
going
to
be
a
sort
of
a
test
case
you
the
worst
applicant
i
have
ever
had
if
the
navy
can
make
a
sailor
out
of
you
it
can
make
a
sailor
out
of
anybody
he
paused
for
a
moment
then
added
emphatically
without
exception
thank
you
sir
i
replied
humbly
report
here
monday
for
physical
examination
he
continued
waving
my
thanks
aside
and
now
go
away
illustration
you
enlist
for
foreign
service
he
snapped
i
replied
will
all
be
foreign
to
me
i
accordingly
went
but
as
i
did
so
i
fancied
i
caught
the
reflection
of
a
smile
lurking
guiltily
under
his
mustache
it
was
the
sort
of
a
smile
i
imagined
at
the
time
that
might
flicker
across
the
grim
visage
of
a
lion
in
the
act
of
anticipating
an
approaching
trip
to
a
prosperous
native
village
i
never
fully
appreciated
what
a
truly
democratic
nation
the
united
states
was
until
i
beheld
it
naked
that
is
until
i
beheld
a
number
of
her
sons
in
that
condition
nakedness
is
the
most
democratic
of
all
institutions
warts
and
chilblains
bowlegs
boils
and
are
respecters
of
no
caste
or
creed
but
visit
us
all
alike
these
profound
reflections
came
to
me
as
i
stood
with
a
large
gathering
of
my
fellow
creatures
in
the
offices
of
the
physical
examiner
never
have
i
seen
a
more
unpromising
candidate
in
all
my
past
experience
said
the
doctor
moodily
when
i
presented
myself
before
him
and
thereupon
he
proceeded
to
punch
me
in
the
ribs
with
a
vigor
that
seemed
to
be
more
personal
than
professional
when
thoroughly
exhausted
from
this
he
gave
up
and
led
me
to
the
eye
charts
which
i
read
with
infinite
ease
through
long
practise
in
following
the
world
series
in
front
of
newspaper
buildings
eyes
all
right
he
said
in
a
disappointed
voice
it
must
be
your
feet
these
proved
to
be
faultless
as
were
my
ears
and
teeth
you
baffle
me
said
the
doctor
at
last
thoroughly
discouraged
apparently
you
are
sound
all
over
yet
looking
at
you
i
fail
to
see
how
it
is
possible
i
wondered
vaguely
if
he
was
paid
by
the
rejection
then
for
no
particular
reason
he
suddenly
tired
of
me
and
left
me
with
all
my
golden
youth
and
glory
standing
unnoticed
in
a
corner
from
here
i
observed
an
applicant
being
put
through
his
ear
test
this
game
is
played
as
follows
a
hospital
apprentice
thrusts
one
finger
into
the
victim
ear
while
the
doctor
hurries
down
to
the
end
of
the
room
and
whispers
tragically
words
that
the
applicant
must
repeat
it
a
good
game
but
this
fellow
i
was
watching
evidently
did
know
the
rules
and
he
was
taking
no
chances
now
repeat
what
i
say
said
the
doctor
repeat
what
i
say
quoted
the
recruit
no
no
not
now
cried
the
doctor
wait
till
i
whisper
no
not
now
wait
till
i
whisper
answered
the
recruit
faithfully
accurate
wait
till
i
whisper
you
blockhead
shouted
the
doctor
till
i
whisper
you
blockhead
shouted
the
recruit
with
equal
heat
oh
god
cried
the
doctor
despairingly
god
repeated
the
recruit
in
a
mournful
voice
this
little
drama
of
cross
purposes
might
have
continued
indefinitely
had
not
the
hospital
apprentice
begun
to
punch
the
guy
in
the
ribs
shouting
as
he
did
so
wait
a
minute
ca
you
at
which
the
recruit
a
great
hulk
of
a
fellow
delivered
the
hospital
apprentice
a
resounding
blow
in
the
stomach
and
turned
indignantly
to
the
doctor
that
man
interfering
he
said
in
an
injured
voice
now
that
fair
is
it
doc
you
pass
said
the
doctor
briefly
producing
his
handkerchief
and
mopping
his
brow
well
what
are
you
standing
around
for
he
said
a
moment
later
spying
me
in
my
corner
oh
doctor
i
cried
delighted
i
thought
you
had
forgotten
me
no
said
the
doctor
i
never
forget
you
you
pass
take
your
papers
and
clear
out
i
can
now
feel
with
a
certain
degree
of
security
that
i
am
in
the
navy
i
broke
the
news
to
mother
and
she
took
it
like
a
little
gentleman
only
crying
on
twelve
different
occasions
i
had
estimated
it
much
higher
than
that
after
dinner
she
read
me
a
list
of
the
things
i
was
to
take
with
me
to
camp
among
which
were
several
sorts
of
life
preservers
an
electric
bed
warmer
and
a
pair
of
dancing
pumps
why
not
include
spurs
i
asked
referring
to
the
pumps
i
look
very
crisp
in
spurs
and
they
would
help
me
in
climbing
the
rigging
but
some
officer
might
ask
you
to
a
dance
protested
mother
mother
i
replied
firmly
i
have
decided
to
decline
all
social
engagements
during
my
first
few
weeks
in
camp
you
can
send
the
pumps
when
i
write
for
them
a
card
came
ordering
me
to
report
on
march
consequently
i
am
not
quite
myself
mother
hurried
into
my
room
this
morning
and
started
to
pack
my
trunk
she
had
gotten
five
sweaters
three
helmets
and
two
dozen
pairs
of
socks
into
it
before
i
could
stop
her
when
i
explained
to
her
that
i
was
going
to
take
a
trunk
she
almost
broke
down
but
at
least
she
said
brightening
up
i
can
go
along
with
you
and
see
that
you
are
nice
and
comfortable
in
your
room
you
seem
to
think
that
i
am
going
to
some
swell
boarding
school
mother
i
replied
from
the
bed
you
see
we
do
have
rooms
to
ourselves
i
understand
that
we
sleep
in
bays
do
jest
cried
mother
it
too
horrible
then
i
explained
to
her
that
a
bay
was
a
compartment
of
a
barracks
in
which
eight
human
beings
and
one
petty
officer
not
quite
so
human
were
supposed
to
dwell
in
intimacy
and
as
far
as
possible
concord
this
distressed
poor
mother
dreadfully
but
what
are
you
going
to
take
she
cried
i
going
to
take
a
nap
said
i
turning
over
on
my
pillow
it
will
be
the
last
one
in
a
bed
for
a
long
long
time
at
this
mother
stuffed
a
pair
of
socks
in
her
mouth
and
left
the
room
hastily
polly
came
in
and
i
kissed
her
on
and
off
throughout
the
evening
on
the
strength
of
my
departure
this
infuriated
father
but
mother
thought
it
was
very
pretty
however
before
going
to
bed
he
gave
me
a
handsome
wrist
watch
and
grandfather
pointing
to
his
game
leg
said
remember
the
mexican
war
my
boy
i
fought
and
bled
honorably
in
that
war
by
gad
sir
i
know
for
a
fact
that
the
dear
old
gentleman
has
never
been
further
west
than
the
mississippi
river
on
the
train
i
have
just
gone
through
my
and
taken
out
some
of
mother
last
little
gifts
such
as
toilet
water
a
padded
coat
hanger
one
hot
water
bottle
some
cough
syrup
two
pairs
of
a
paper
vest
and
a
blue
pokerdotted
silk
muffler
she
put
them
in
when
i
was
looking
i
have
hidden
them
under
the
seat
may
the
lord
forgive
me
for
a
faithless
son
the
departure
was
moist
but
i
managed
to
swim
through
i
am
too
excited
to
read
the
paper
and
too
to
think
except
in
terrified
snatches
i
wonder
if
i
look
different
people
seem
to
be
regarding
me
sympathetically
i
recognize
two
faces
on
this
train
one
belongs
to
tony
the
iceman
on
our
block
the
other
belongs
to
one
named
tim
a
barkeep
if
i
recall
rightly
in
a
hotel
i
have
frequently
graced
with
my
presence
i
hope
their
past
friendship
was
not
due
to
professional
reasons
it
would
be
nice
to
talk
over
old
times
with
them
in
camp
for
i
have
frequently
met
the
one
in
the
morning
after
coming
home
from
the
other
illustration
the
departure
was
moist
subjected
myself
to
the
intimate
scrutiny
of
another
doctor
this
morning
i
used
my
very
best
turkish
bath
manners
they
failed
to
impress
him
hospital
apprentice
treated
me
to
a
shot
of
pelham
hop
it
is
taken
in
the
customary
manner
through
the
arm
very
stimulating
a
large
sailor
held
me
by
the
hand
for
fully
fifteen
minutes
very
embarrassing
he
made
pictures
of
my
fingers
and
completely
demolished
my
manicure
from
there
i
passed
on
to
another
room
here
a
number
of
men
threw
clothes
at
me
from
all
directions
the
man
with
the
shoes
was
a
splendid
shot
i
am
now
a
sailor
at
least
superficially
my
trousers
were
built
for
charlie
chaplin
i
feel
like
a
masquerade
illustration
hospital
apprentice
treated
me
to
a
shot
of
pelham
illustration
i
feel
like
a
masquerade
a
gang
of
recruits
shouted
days
at
me
as
i
was
being
led
to
mess
hall
no
the
poor
simps
had
just
come
in
the
day
before
and
had
not
even
washed
their
leggings
yet
i
shall
shout
at
other
recruits
though
the
same
thing
that
they
shouted
at
me
our
is
a
very
terrifying
character
he
is
a
stern
but
just
man
i
take
it
he
can
tie
knots
and
box
the
compass
and
say
pipe
down
and
everything
gee
it
must
be
nice
to
be
a
real
sailor
illustration
this
i
thought
was
adding
insult
to
injury
fell
out
of
my
hammock
last
night
and
momentarily
interrupted
the
snoring
contest
holding
sway
i
was
told
to
pipe
down
in
irish
yiddish
third
avenue
and
bronx
this
i
thought
was
adding
insult
to
injury
but
could
not
make
any
one
take
the
same
view
of
it
i
hope
the
thing
does
not
become
a
habit
with
me
i
form
habits
so
readily
in
connection
with
snoring
i
have
written
the
following
song
which
i
am
going
to
send
home
to
polly
i
wrote
it
in
the
hut
this
afternoon
while
crouching
between
the
feet
of
two
embattled
checker
players
i
going
to
call
it
the
rhyme
of
the
snoring
sailor
it
goes
like
this
i
the
mother
thinks
of
her
sailor
son
as
clutched
in
the
arms
of
war
but
mother
should
listen
as
i
have
done
to
this
same
little
innocent
sailor
son
sprawl
in
his
hammock
and
snore
oh
the
sailor
man
is
a
rugged
man
the
master
of
wind
and
wave
and
poets
sing
till
the
ring
of
his
picturesque
deep
sea
grave
and
they
likewise
write
of
the
storm
at
night
when
the
numerous
north
winds
roar
but
more
profound
is
the
dismal
sound
of
a
sailor
snore
ii
oh
mothers
knit
for
their
sailor
sons
socks
for
their
nautical
toes
but
mothers
should
list
to
the
frightful
noise
made
by
their
innocent
sailor
boys
by
the
wind
they
blow
through
their
nose
oh
life
at
sea
is
wild
and
free
and
greatly
to
be
admired
but
i
would
sleep
both
sound
and
deep
at
night
when
i
feeling
tired

here
we
go
with

iii
oh
mothers
write
to
your
sons
at
sea
write
to
them
i
implore
a
letter
as
earnest
as
it
can
be
containing
a
delicate
motherly
plea
a
plea
for
them
not
to
snore
oh
i
take
much
pride
in
my
trousers
wide
the
ladies
all
think
them
sweet
and
i
must
admit
that
i
love
to
sit
in
a
chair
and
relieve
my
feet
avast
belay
and
we
bound
away
with
our
hearts
lashed
fast
to
the
fore
but
when
mermaids
sleep
in
their
bowers
deep
do
you
think
that
the
sweet
things
snore
our
company
commander
spoke
to
us
this
morning
in
no
uncertain
terms
he
seems
to
be
such
a
serious
man
there
is
a
peculiar
quality
in
his
voice
not
unlike
the
tone
of
a
french
mm
gun
you
can
easily
hear
everything
he
says
miles
away
we
rested
this
afternoon
sunday
a
day
of
rest
for
which
i
gave
in
the
words
of
our
indefatigable
chaplain
three
good
rollicking
cheers
some
folks
are
coming
up
to
see
me
this
afternoon
i
hear
i
must
moo
through
the
fence
at
them
like
a
cow
later
the
folks
have
just
left
mother
kept
screaming
through
the
wire
about
my
underwear
she
seemed
to
have
it
on
her
brain
there
were
several
young
girls
standing
right
next
to
her
i
really
felt
i
was
no
longer
a
bachelor
why
do
mothers
lay
such
tremendous
stress
on
underwear
they
seem
to
believe
that
a
son
sole
duty
to
his
parents
consists
in
publicly
announcing
that
he
is
clad
in
winter
flannels

mother
kept
screaming
through
the
wire
about
my
underwear
polly
drove
up
for
a
moment
with
joe
henderson
i
hope
the
draft
gets
hold
of
that
bird
they
were
going
to
have
tea
at
the
biltmore
when
they
got
back
to
the
city
i
almost
bit
the
end
off
of
a
bayonet
when
i
heard
this
woeful
piece
of
news
liberty
looks
a
long
way
off
i
made
an
attempt
to
write
some
letters
in
the
this
evening
but
gave
up
before
the
combined
assault
of
a
phonograph
a
piano
and
a
flanking
detachment
of
checker
players
several
benches
fell
on
me
and
i
went
to
the
mat
feeling
very
sorry
for
myself
the
morning
broke
badly
i
lashed
my
hand
to
my
hammock
and
was
forced
to
call
on
the
to
extricate
me
he
remarked
with
bitterness
that
i
could
think
of
more
ineffectual
things
to
do
than
any
rookie
it
had
been
his
misfortune
to
meet
i
told
him
that
i
did
have
to
think
of
them
they
just
came
naturally
last
night
i
was
nearly
frightened
out
of
my
hammock
by
awakening
and
gazing
into
the
malevolent
eye
of
my
wrist
watch
i
thought
for
a
moment
that
the
woolworth
tower
had
crawled
into
bed
with
me
it
gave
me
such
a
start
i
must
get
used
to
my
wrist
watch
also
wearing
a
handkerchief
up
my
sleeve
i
feel
like
the
sweet
kid
himself
now
drill
all
day
my
belt
fell
off
and
tripped
me
up
why
do
such
things
always
happen
to
me
somebody
told
us
to
do
squads
left
and
it
looked
as
if
we
were
playing
ring
around
rosie
then
we
performed
a
fiendish
and
complicated
little
quadrille
called
a
company
square
i
found
myself
much
to
my
horror
on
the
inside
of
the
contraption
walking
directly
behind
the
company
commander
it
was
a
very
delicate
situation
for
a
while
i
walked
on
my
so
that
he
hear
me
had
he
looked
around
i
know
i
have
dropped
my
gun
and
lit
out
for
home
and
mother
forgot
to
take
my
hat
off
in
the
mess
room
i
was
reminded
though
by
several
hundred
thoughtful
people
stood
for
half
an
hour
in
the
mail
line
got
one
letter
a
bill
from
a
restaurant
for
eighteen
dollars
worth
of
past
luncheons

have
the
heart
to
write
more

i
almost
put
my
eye
out
at

salute
however
my
bag
looked
very
cute
indeed
and
although
he
did
say
anything
i
feel
sure
the
inspecting
officer
thought
mine
was
the
best
i
had
a
beautiful
embroidered
handkerchief
holder
prominently
displayed
which
i
am
sure
must
have
knocked
him
cold
he
missed
the
dirty

never

my
hammock
came
unlashed
right
in
front
of
a
and
he
asked
me
if
i
was
going
to
sleep
in
it
on
the
spot
it
was
a
very
inspiring
scene
particularly
thrilling
was
the
picture
i
caught
of
a
very
heavy
sailor
picking
on
a
poor
innocent
looking
little
fire
extinguisher
he
ran
the
thing
right
over
my
foot
i
apologized
as
usual
i
discovered
that
i
have
been
putting
half
instead
of
marlin
hitches
in
my
hammock
but
not
before
the
inspecting
officer
did
he
seemed
very
upset
about
it
when
he
asked
me
why
i
only
put
six
hitches
in
my
hammock
instead
of
seven
i
replied
that
my
rope
was
short
his
reply
still
burns
in
my
memory
what
eloquence
what
earnestness
what

life
in
the
navy
is
just
one
round
of
engagements
to
keep
simply
splendid
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
get
up
at
in
the
morning
when
it
is
nice
and
dark
and
play
around
with
the
cutest
little
hammock
imaginable
when
you
have
arrived
at
the
most
interesting
part
of
this
game
the
four
hitch
period
and
you
are
wondering
whether
you
are
going
to
beat
your
previous
record
and
get
six
instead
of
five
the
bugle
blows
and
immediately
throws
you
into
a
state
of
great
indecision
the
problem
is
whether
to
finish
the
hammock
and
be
reported
late
for
muster
or
to
attend
muster
and
be
reported
for
not
having
finished
your
hammock
the
time
spent
in
considering
this
problem
usually
results
in
your
trying
to
do
both
and
in
failing
to
accomplish
either
getting
reported
on
two
counts
any
enlisted
man
is
entitled
to
play
this
game
and
he
is
sure
of
making
a
score
after
running
around
innumerable
miles
of
early
morning
camp
scenery
and
losing
several
buttons
from
your
new
trousers
you
come
back
and
do
greek
dances
for
a
man
who
aspires
to
become
a
second
mordkin
or
a
isadora
duncan
this
is
all
very
sweet
and
i
am
sure
the
boys
play
prettily
together
first
he
dances
then
we
dance
then
he
interprets
a
bird
and
we
all
flutter
back
at
him
this
being
done
to
his
apparent
satisfaction
we
proceed
to
crawl
and
grind
and
weave
and
wave
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
this
is
designed
to
give
us
physical
poise
to
enable
us
to
go
aloft
in
a
graceful
and
pleasing
manner
after
this
dancing
in
the
dew
you
return
for
a
few
more
rounds
with
your
hammock
clean
up
your
bay
and
stand
in
line
for
breakfast
after
breakfast
we
muster
again
and
a
gentleman
talks
to
us
in
a
voice
that
would
lead
you
to
believe
that
he
thought
we
were
all
in
hiding
somewhere
in
new
rochelle
then
there
are
any
number
of
things
to
do
to
divert
our
minds
scrub
hammocks
pick
up
cigarettes
drill
hike
and
attend
lectures
as
a
rule
we
do
all
of
these
things
from
until
if
we
are
unfortunate
enough
not
to
have
a
lecture
party
we
are
free
to
give
ourselves
over
to
the
riotous
joy
of
the
moment
which
consists
of
listening
to
a
phonograph
swear
bitterly
at
a
piano
long
past
its
prime
the
final
act
of
the
drama
of
the
day
is
performed
on
the
hammock
an
animated
little
sketch
of
arms
and
legs
conducted
along
the
lines
of
houdini
getting
into
a
or
does
he
get
out
of
them
i
do
know
perhaps
both
anyway

this
spring
weather
is
bringing
the
birds
out
in
great
quantities
they
bloomed
along
the
fence
today
like
a
ziegfeld
chorus
on
an
outing
one
girl
carried
on
a
coherent
conversation
with
six
different
fellows
at
once
and
left
each
of
them
feeling
that
he
alone
had
been
singled
out
for
her
particular
favor
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
flirting
with
her
all
the
time
and
i
could
tell
by
the
very
way
she
looked
that
she
would
have
much
rather
been
talking
to
me
last
week
i
had
to
convince
mother
that
i
was
wearing
my
flannels
this
week
i
had
to
convince
her
i
still
had
them
on
the
only
way
to
satisfy
her
i
suppose
is
to
appear
before
her
publicly
in
them
poor
dear
mother
she
told
me
she
had
written
the
doctor
up
here
asking
him
not
to
squirt
my
arm
full
of
those
horrid
little
germs
any
more
she
said
i
came
from
a
good
clean
family
and
had
been
bathed
once
a
week
all
my
life
except
the
time
when
i
had
the
measles
and
then
it
was
advisable
i
am
sure
this
must
have
cheered
the
doctor
up
tremendously
she
also
asked
him
to
be
sure
to
see
that
i
got
my
meals
regularly
i
can
see
him
now
taking
me
by
the
hand
and
leading
me
to
the
when
i
suggested
to
mother
that
she
write
president
wilson
asking
him
to
be
sure
to
see
that
my
blankets
fall
off
at
night
she
said
that
i
was
a
sarcastic
ungrateful
boy
there
is
something
decidedly
wrong
with
me
as
a
sailor
i
got
my
pictures
try
as
i
may
i
am
unable
to
locate
the
trouble
there
seems
to
be
some
item
left
out
not
enough
salt
in
the
mixture
perhaps
i
do
know
exactly
what
it
is
but
i
seem
to
be
a
little
too
may
i
say
handsome
or
perhaps
polished
would
be
the
better
word
i
afraid
to
send
the
pictures
away
because
no
one
will
believe
them
they
will
think
i
borrowed
the
clothes
a
funny
thing
happened
last
sunday
that
i
forgot
to
record
a
girl
had
her
foot
on
the
fence
and
when
she
took
it
down
every
one
yelled
as
you
were
sailors
have
such
a
delicate
sense
of
humor
well
that
about
enough
for
we
had
a
lecture
on
boats
the
only
thing
i
know
now
is
how
to
tell
a
bilge
from
a
painter
the
oar
was
easy
it
is
divided
into
three
parts
the
stem
the
lead
and
the
muzzle
i
must
remember
this
it
is
very
important
the
men
are
getting
so
used
to
inoculations
around
here
that
they
complain
when
they
do
get
enough
we
shaping
up
into
a
fine
body
of
men
our
company
commander
told
us
this
morning
and
added
that
if
we
continue
to
pick
up
cigarette
butts
several
more
weeks
we
be
able
to
stack
arms
without
dropping
our
guns
eli
the
goat
seems
unwell
i
attribute
his
unfortunate
condition
to
his
constant
and
unrelenting
efforts
to
keep
the
canteen
clear
of
paper
it
is
my
belief
that
goats
are
not
healthy
because
of
the
fact
that
they
eat
paper
but
in
spite
of
it
and
i
feel
sure
that
if
all
goats
got
together
and
decided
to
cut
out
paper
for
a
while
and
live
on
a
regular
diet
they
would
be
a
much
more
robust
race
the
movies
were
great
i
saw
sidney
drew
left
ear
and
a
mole
on
the
neck
of
the
man
in
front
of
me
a
fellow
in
our
bay
asked
last
night
how
much
an
admiral
pay
was
a
month
and
when
we
told
him
he
yawned
turned
over
on
his
side
and
said
not
enough
he
added
that
he
could
pick
up
that
much
at
a
parade
any
time
we
all
tightened
our
wrist
watches
been
blinking
at
the
blinker
all
evening
ca
make
much
sense
out
of
it
the
bloomin
thing
is
always
two
blinks
ahead
of
me
it
all
very
nice
i
dare
say
but
i
much
rather
get
my
messages
on
scented
paper
i
got
one
she
called
me
her
great
big
cute
little
sailor
boy
those
were
her
exact
words
how
clever
she
is
going
to
marry
her
just
as
soon
as
i
a
junior
lieutenant
wait
a
year
anyway
i
made
up
verses
to
myself
in
my
hammock
last
night
perhaps
i
send
some
of
them
to
the
camp
paper
it
would
be
nice
to
see
your
stuff
in
print
here
one
of
the
poems
unregenerate

i
i
take
my
booze
in
my
overshoes
i
fond
of
the
taste

rubber
i
oil

hair

the
grease

ii
my
dusky
wife
was
a
source
of
strife
so
i
left
her
in
singapore
and
sailed
away
at
the
break
of
day
since
then
i
have
widowed
four
iii
avast
belay
and
that
i
gazed
in
the
eyes
of
beauty
for
in
devious
ways
their
innocent
gaze
has
caused
me
much
extra
duty
iv
i
never
get
past
the
jolly
old
mast
the
skipper
and
i
are
quite
chummy
he
knows
me
by
sight
when
i
sober
or
tight
and
calls
me
a
wicked
old
rummy
a
sort
of
type
i
intend
to
make
him
a
seafaring
man
of
the
old
school
such
as
i
suppose
some
of
the
around
here
were
i
do
imagine
it
was
very
difficult
to
get
a
good
conduct
record
in
the
old
days
because
from
all
the
tales
i
heard
from
this
source
and
that
a
who
did
not
too
openly
boast
of
being
a
bigamist
and
who
limited
his
homicidical
inclinations
to
half
a
dozen
foreigners
when
on
shore
leave
was
considered
a
highly
respectable
character
perhaps
this
is
not
at
all
true
and
i
for
one
can
hardly
believe
it
when
i
look
at
the
virtuous
and
impeccable
exteriors
of
the
few
remaining
representatives
with
whom
i
have
come
in
contact
however
any
one
has
my
permission
to
ask
them
if
it
is
true
or
not
should
they
care
to
find
out
for
themselves
i
refuse
to
be
held
responsible
though
i
think
i
shall
send
this
poem
to
the
paper
soon
it
must
be
wonderful
to
get
your
poems
in
print
all
my
friends
would
be
so
proud
to
know
me
i
wonder
if
the
editors
are
well
disposed
men
illustration
liberty
party
from
all
i
hear
they
must
be
a
hard
lot
probably
they
be
nice
to
me
because
of
my
connections
i
know
so
many
bartenders
next
week
i
rate
liberty
ah
little
book
i
wonder
what
these
pages
will
contain
when
i
come
back
i
hate
to
think
new
york
you
know
is
such
an
interesting
place
man
man
how
i
suffer
i
so
weary
i
could
sleep
on
my
company
commander
breast
and
to
bring
oneself
to
that
one
must
be
considerably
fatigued
so
to
speak
who
invented
liberty
anyway
a
greatly
pastime
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
consisting
of
coming
and
going
with
the
middle
part
omitted
one
man
whispered
to
me
at
muster
this
morning
that
all
he
could
remember
of
his
liberty
was
checking
out
and
checking
in
he
looked
unwell
my
old
pal
spike
kelly
i
hear
was
also
out
of
luck
his
girl
was
the
skipper
of
a
fourteenth
street
crosstown
car
so
he
was
forced
to
spend
most
of
his
time
riding
between
the
two
rivers
he
nickeled
himself
to
death
in
doing
it
he
said
if
shonts
plays
golf
as
no
doubt
he
does
he
has
spike
kelly
to
thank
for
a
nice
new
box
of
golf
balls
and
while
on
the
subject
spike
observes
that
one
of
those
engaging
car
signs
should
read
is
it
gallantry
or
the
advent
of
woman
suffrage
or
the
presence

spike
says
that
his
liberty
was
his
first
actual
touch
with
the
horrors
of
war
another
bird
that
lived
in
some
remote
corner
of
new
york
state
told
me
in
pitiful
tones
that
all
he
had
time
to
do
was
to
walk
down
the
street
of
his
home
town
shake
hands
with
the
postmaster
lean
over
the
fence
and
kiss
his
girl
it
had
to
go
two
ways
hello
and
take
a
package
of
clean
underwear
from
his
mother
as
he
passed
by
and
catch
the
outbound
train
on
the
dead
run
all
he
could
do
was
to
wave
to
the
seven
other
inhabitants
he
thought
the
grand
central
terminal
was
a
swell
dump
though
he
said
there
was
quite
a
lot
of
it
which
is
true
as
for
myself
i
think
it
best
to
pass
lightly
over
most
of
the
incidents
of
my
own
personal
liberty
the
best
part
of
a
diary
is
that
one
can
show
up
one
friends
to
the
exclusion
of
oneself
anyway
why
put
down
the
happenings
of
the
past
hours
they
are
indelibly
stamped
on
my
memory
one
sight
i
vividly
recall
ardy
muggins
the
of
muggins
who
makes
the
automatic
clothes
wranglers
he
was
sitting
in
a
roadster
in
front
of
the
biltmore
and
the
dear
boy
was
dressed
this
wise
ardy
is
a
sailor
too
i
forgot
to
mention
there
was
a
white
hat
on
his
head
covering
and
completely
obliterating
his
liberty
blues
was
a
huge
bearskin
coat
which
when
pulled
up
disclosed
his
leggins
neatly
strapped
over
patent
leather
dancing
pumps
it
was
an
astounding
sight
one
that
filled
me
with
profound
emotion
are
you
a
trifle
out
of
uniform
ardy
i
asked
him
one
has
to
be
so
delicate
with
ardy
he
that
sensitive
why
i
thought
i
might
as
well
embellish
myself
a
bit
says
ardy
you
done
all
of
that
says
i
but
for
heaven
sake
dear
do
keep
away
from
fourteenth
street
there
are
numerous
sailors
down
there
who
might
embellish
you
still
further
my
god
cries
ardy
striving
to
crush
the
wind
out
of
the
horn
i
never
slum
do
says
i
passing
inside
to
shake
hands
with
several
of
my
friends
behind
the
mahogany
shake
hands
alas
was
all
i
did
i
must
speak
about
the
examinations
before
i
forget
it
what
a
clubby
time
we
had
of
it
i
got
in
a
trifle
wrong
at
the
start
on
account
of
my
sociable
nature
you
know
i
thought
it
was
a
sort
of
a
farewell
reception
given
by
the
officers
and
the
to
the
men
departing
after
their
days
in
probation
so
the
first
thing
i
did
when
i
went
in
was
to
shake
hands
with
an
ensign
who
i
thought
was
receiving
he
got
rid
of
my
hand
with
the
same
briskness
that
one
removes
a
live
coal
from
one
person
the
whole
proceeding
struck
me
as
being
a
sort
of
charity
bazaar
people
were
wandering
around
from
booth
to
booth
in
a
pleasant
sociable
manner
passing
a
word
here
and
sitting
down
there
in
the
way
imaginable
leaving
the
ensign
rather
abruptly
i
attached
myself
to
the
throng
and
started
in
search
of
ice
cream
and
cake
this
brought
me
up
at
a
table
where
there
was
a
very
pleasant
looking
holding
sway
and
with
him
i
thought
i
would
hold
a
few
words
what
was
my
horror
on
hearing
him
snap
out
in
a
very
crusty
manner
how
often
do
you
change
your
socks
this
is
a
question
i
allow
no
man
to
ask
me
it
is
particularly
objectionable
why
sir
i
replied
do
you
think
you
are
slightly
overstepping
the
bounds
of
good
taste
one
does
not
even
jest
about
such
totally
personal
matters
ye
know
then
rising
i
was
about
to
walk
away
without
even
waiting
for
his
reply
but
he
called
me
back
and
handed
me
my
paper
on
which
he
had
written
impossible
and
underlined
it
the
next
booth
i
visited
seemed
to
be
a
little
more
hospitable
so
i
sat
down
with
the
rest
of
the
fellows
and
prepared
to
talk
of
the
events
of
the
past
days
how
many
articles
are
there
suddenly
asked
a
who
hitherto
had
escaped
my
attention
twelve
i
replied
promptly
thinking
i
might
just
as
well
play
the
game
too
what
are
they
based
on
he
almost
hissed
but
not
quite
the
constitution
of
these
united
states
i
cried
in
a
loud
voice
at
which
the
choked
and
turned
dangerously
red
it
seems
that
not
only
was
i
not
quite
right
but
that
i
could
have
been
more
wrong
go
he
gasped
before
i
do
you
some
injury
a
very
peculiar
man
i
thought
but
nevertheless
his
heart
seemed
so
set
on
my
going
that
i
thought
it
would
be
best
for
us
to
part
i
am
sure
i
do
not
wish
to
force
myself
upon
you
i
said
icily
as
i
left
the
poor
man
appeared
to
be
on
the
verge
of
having
a
fit
do
you
want
to
tie
some
knots
asked
a
at
the
next
booth
crazy
about
it
says
i
easy
like
then
tie
some
says
he
so
i
tied
a
very
pretty
little
knot
i
had
learned
at
the
kindergarten
some
years
ago
and
showed
it
to
him
what
that
says
he
that
replies
i
coyly
why
that
is
simply
a
true
lover
knot
do
you
like
it
orderly
he
screamed
orderly
remove
this
and
hands
were
laid
upon
me
and
i
was
hurled
into
the
arms
of
a
small
but
ever
so
appearing
chap
who
was
engaged
in
balancing
his
hat
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose
and
at
the
same
time
after
beating
me
over
the
head
several
times
with
the
flags
he
said
i
could
play
with
him
and
he
began
to
send
me
messages
with
rapidity
what
is
it
he
asked
really
i
replied
i
lost
interest
in
your
message
before
you
finished
after
this
my
paper
looked
like
a
million
dollars
with
the
one
knocked
off
what
a
hackamatack
asked
the
next
guy
thinking
he
was
either
kidding
me
or
given
to
using
baby
talk
i
replied
why
it
a
mixture
between
a
thingamabob
and
a
nibleck
his
treatment
of
me
after
this
answer
so
unnerved
me
that
i
dropped
my
gun
at
the
next
booth
and
became
completely
demoralized
the
greatest
disappointment
awaited
me
at
monkey
drill
or
setting
up
exercises
however
i
thought
i
was
going
to
kill
this
i
felt
sure
i
was
going
to
outstrip
all
competitors
but
in
the
middle
of
it
all
the
examiner
yelled
out
in
one
of
those
sarcastic
voices
that
all
rookies
learn
to
fear
are
you
trying
to
flirt
with
me
or
do
you
think
you
a
bloomin
angel
this
so
sickened
me
at
heart
that
i
left
the
place
without
further
ado
whatever
that
might
be
pink
teas
in
the
navy
are
not
unmixed
virtues
my
birthday
and
oh
how
i
do
miss
my
cake
it
the
first
birthday
i
ever
had
without
a
cake
except
two
and
then
i
had
a
bottle
oh
how
well
i
remember
my
last
party
birthday
party
there
was
father
and
the
cake
all
lit
up
in
the
center
of
the
table
i
mean
the
cake
not
father
of
course
and
there
was
gladys
i
always
called
her
glad
she
been
coming
to
my
birthday
parties
for
years
and
years
she
always
came
first
and
left
last
and
ate
the
most
and
got
the
sickest
of
all
the
girls
i
knew
it
was
appalling
how
that
girl
could
eat
but
as
i
was
saying
there
was
father
and
the
cake
and
there
was
mother
and
glad
and
all
the
little
candles
were
twinkling
lighting
up
my
presents
clustered
around
among
them
being
half
a
dozen
maroon
silk
socks
a
box
of
striped
neck
ties
all
perfect
joys
spats
a
lounging
gown
ever
so
many
gloves
and
the
snappiest
little
cane
in
all
the
world
and
what
have
i
around
me
now
a
swab
on
one
side
a
bucket
on
the
other
a
broom
draped
over
my
shoulder
in
front
of
me
behind
me
and
work
all
around
me
oh
what
a
helluvabirthday
i
told
my
company
commander
last
night
that
the
next
day
was
going
to
be
my
birthday
hoping
he
would
do
the
handsome
thing
and
let
me
sleep
a
little
later
in
the
morning
but
did
he
no
the
brute
he
said
i
should
get
up
earlier
so
as
to
enjoy
it
longer
as
far
as
i
can
find
out
the
camp
remains
totally
unmoved
by
the
fact
that
i
am
one
year
older
and
what
a
hubbub
they
used
to
raise
at
home
i
think
the
very
least
they
could
do
up
here
would
be
to
ask
me
to
eat
with
the
officers
these
new
barracks
over
in
the
main
camp
are
too
large
not
nearly
so
nice
as
our
cosey
little
bays
i
really
homesick
for
probation
and
the
sound
of
our
old
company
commander
dulcet
voice
i
met
eli
on
the
street
and
i
almost
broke
down
on
his
neck
and
cried
he
was
the
first
familiar
thing
i
had
seen
since
i
came
over
to
the
main
camp
this
place
is
just
like
the
probation
camp
only
more
so
life
is
one
continual
lecture
trimmed
with
drills
and
hikes
oh
when
will
i
ever
be
an
ensign
with
a
cute
little
submarine
chaser
all
my
own
the
events
of
the
past
few
days
have
so
unnerved
me
that
i
have
fallen
behind
in
my
diary
i
must
try
to
catch
up
for
what
would
posterity
do
should
the
record
of
my
inspiring
career
in
the
service
not
be
faithfully
recorded
for
them
to
read
with
reverence
and
amazement
in
days
to
come
one
of
the
unfortunate
events
arose
from
scraping
a
too
intimate
acquaintance
with
that
horrid
old
push
ball
how
did
it
ever
get
into
camp
anyway
and
who
ever
heard
of
a
ball
being
so
large
it
seem
somehow
right
to
me
out
of
taste
if
you
get
what
i
mean
there
is
a
certain
lack
of
restraint
and
conservatism
about
it
which
all
games
played
among
gentlemen
most
positively
should
possess
but
the
chap
who
pushed
that
great
big
beast
of
a
push
ball
violently
upon
my
unsuspecting
nose
was
certainly
no
gentleman
golly
what
a
resounding
whack
this
fellow
i
suspect
him
of
being
a
german
spy
basing
my
suspicions
upon
his
seeming
disposition
for
atrocities
was
standing
by
looking
morosely
at
this
small
size
planet
when
i
blows
gently
up
and
says
playfully
in
my
most
engaging
voice
i
say
old
dear
you
push
it
to
me
and
i
push
it
to
you
softly
though
chappy
softly
and
with
that
he
flung
himself
upon
the
ball
and
hurled
it
full
upon
my
nose
completely
demolishing
it
now
i
have
always
been
a
little
partial
to
my
nose
my
eyes
i
admit
are
not
quite
as
soulful
as
those
liquid
orbs
of
francis
bushman
but
my
nose
has
been
frequently
admired
and
envied
in
the
best
drawing
rooms
in
new
york
but
it
wo
be
envied
any
more
i
fear
pitied
rather
of
course
i
played
the
game
no
more
i
was
nauseated
by
pain
and
the
sight
of
blood
my
assassin
was
actually
forced
to
sit
down
he
was
so
weak
from
brutal
laughter
i
wonder
if
i
can
ever
be
an
ensign
with
a
nose
like
this
illustration
of
course
i
played
the
game
no
more
on
the
way
back
from
a
little
outing
the
other
day
my
companion
tim
who
in
civil
life
had
been
a
barkeeper
and
a
good
one
at
that
ingratiated
himself
in
the
good
graces
of
a
passing
automobile
party
and
we
consequently
were
asked
in
there
were
two
girls
sisters
i
fancy
and
a
father
and
mother
aboard
and
where
do
you
come
from
young
gentlemen
asked
the
old
man
me
pal
comes
from
san
diego
pipes
up
my
unscrupulous
friend
and
my
home
town
is
san
francisco
i
knew
for
a
fact
that
he
had
never
been
farther
from
home
than
the
polo
grounds
and
as
for
me
i
had
only
the
sketchiest
idea
of
where
my
home
town
was
supposed
to
be
ah
westerners
exclaimed
the
old
lady
i
come
from
the
west
myself
my
family
goes
back
there
every
year
yes
chimed
in
the
girls
we
just
love
san
diego
in
what
section
of
the
town
did
you
live
asked
the
gentleman
and
my
friend
whom
i
was
inwardly
cursing
seeing
my
perplexity
quickly
put
in
for
me
oh
you
would
never
know
it
sir
and
then
lowering
his
voice
in
a
confidential
way
he
added
he
kept
a
barroom
in
the
mexican
part
of
the
town
a
barroom
exclaimed
the
old
lady
fancy
that
she
looked
at
me
with
great
innocent
interest
yes
continued
this
lost
soul
my
father
who
is
a
state
senator
sent
him
to
boarding
school
and
tried
to
do
everything
for
him
but
he
drifted
back
into
the
old
life
just
as
soon
as
he
could
it
gets
a
hold
on
them
you
know
yes
i
know
said
the
old
lady
sadly
my
cook
had
a
son
that
went
the
same
way
he
is
really
vicious
though
added
my
false
friend
with
feigned
loyalty
merely
reckless
well
my
poor
boy
put
in
the
old
gentleman
with
cheery
consideration
i
am
sure
you
must
find
that
navy
life
does
you
a
world
of
good
regular
hours
temperate
living
and
all
that
right
you
are
sport
says
i
bitterly
assuming
my
enforced
role
i
have
slit
a
greaser
throat
since
i
enlisted
we
must
all
make
sacrifices
these
days
sighed
the
old
lady
and
perhaps
you
will
be
able
to
exercise
your
er
er
rather
robust
inclinations
on
the
germans
when
you
meet
them
on
the
high
seas
remarked
the
old
man
who
evidently
thought
to
comfort
me
if
i
can
only
keep
him
out
of
the
brig
said
this
friend
of
mine
i
think
they
might
make
a
mess
hand
out
of
him
at
which
remark
both
of
the
girls
who
up
to
this
moment
had
been
studying
me
silently
exploded
into
loud
peals
of
mirth
and
then
i
knew
where
i
had
met
them
before
at
kitty
van
tassel
coming
out
party
and
i
distinctly
recalled
having
spilled
some
punch
on
the
prettier
one
white
satin
slipper
we
get
out
here
i
said
hoarsely
choking
with
rage
but
exclaimed
the
old
lady
it
the
loneliest
part
of
the
road
however
that
may
be
i
replied
with
fine
firmness
i
must
nevertheless
alight
here
i
have
a
great
many
things
to
do
before
i
return
to
camp
and
lonely
roads
are
well
suited
to
my
purposes
my
homicidal
leanings
are
completely
me
watch
him
closely
said
the
old
lady
to
my
companion
as
the
car
came
to
a
stop
he
will
have
to
i
replied
grimly
as
i
prepared
to
alight
perhaps
oswald
will
mix
us
a
cocktail
some
day
said
one
of
the
sisters
leaning
over
the
side
of
the
car
i
have
heard
that
he
supported
many
bars
at
one
time
but
i
never
knew
he
really
owned
one
what
i
heard
the
old
lady
exclaiming
as
the
car
pulled
away
he
really
is
a
bartender
at
all
well
fancy
that
there
were
a
couple
of
pairs
of
rather
dusty
liberty
blues
in
camp
that
night
yesterday
mother
paid
a
visit
to
camp
and
insisted
upon
me
breaking
out
my
hammock
in
order
for
her
to
see
if
i
had
covers
enough
i
can
never
permit
you
to
sleep
in
that
my
dear
she
said
after
pounding
and
prodding
it
for
a
few
numbers
never
and
i
am
sure
the
commander
will
agree
with
me
after
i
have
explained
to
him
how
delicate
you
have
always
been
later
in
the
afternoon
she
became
a
trifle
mollified
when
i
told
her
that
the
came
around
every
night
and
distributed
extra
blankets
to
every
one
that
felt
cold
be
sure
to
see
that
he
gives
you
enough
coverings
she
said
severely
or
else
put
him
on
report
which
i
faithfully
promised
to
do
she
was
greatly
delighted
with
the
and
the
hostess
committee
here
i
stood
her
up
for
several
bricks
of
ice
cream
and
a
large
quantity
of
cake
my
fourth
attempt
she
refused
however
saying
by
way
of
explanation
to
a
very
pretty
girl
standing
by
it
would
be
good
for
him
my
dear
my
son
has
always
had
such
a
weak
stomach
the
least
little
thing
upsets
him
illustration
she
was
greatly
delighted
with
the
i
believe
you
replied
the
young
lady
sympathetically
as
she
gazed
at
me
i
certainly
looked
upset
at
the
moment
this
was
worse
than
the
underwear
so
that
an
ensign
she
exclaimed
later
in
an
obviously
disappointed
tone
of
voice
well
i
not
so
sure
that
i
want
you
to
become
one
now
the
passing
ensign
could
help
but
hear
her
as
she
had
practically
screamed
in
his
ear
he
turned
and
studied
my
face
carefully
i
think
he
was
making
sure
that
he
could
remember
it
now
take
me
to
your
physician
commanded
mother
resolutely
i
want
to
be
sure
that
he
sees
that
you
take
your
spring
tonic
regularly
mother
i
pleaded
do
you
think
it
is
time
you
were
going
i
have
a
private
lesson
in
sale
embroidery
in
ten
minutes
that
i
would
miss
for
the
world
the
sweetest
man
teaches
it
well
under
the
circumstances
i
wo
keep
you
said
mother
but
i
write
to
the
doctor
just
the
same
yes
do
i
urged
send
it
care
of
me
so
that
he
be
sure
to
get
it
mother
is
not
a
restful
creature
in
camp
say
there
you
with
the
nose
cried
my
company
commander
are
you
with
us
or
are
you
playing
a
little
game
of
your
own
i
was
so
very
wrong
just
the
slight
difference
between
port
and
present
arms
with
you
heart
and
soul
i
replied
hoping
to
make
a
favorable
impression
by
a
smart
retort
that
do
work
in
the
manual
he
replied
use
your
brain
and
ears
unnecessarily
rough
he
was
but
i
do
know
but
what
he
was
right
illustration
i
was
so
very
wrong
just
the
slight
difference
between
port
and
present
arms
i
hear
that
i
am
going
to
be
put
on
the
mess
crew
god
pity
me
poor
wretch
how
shall
i
ever
keep
my
hands
from
becoming
red
what
a
terrible
war
it
is
saw
a
basket
ball
game
the
other
night
never
knew
it
was
so
rough
i
used
to
play
it
with
the
girls
and
we
had
such
sport
there
seemed
to
be
some
reason
for
it
then
there
are
a
couple
of
queer
looking
brothers
on
our
team
who
seem
to
try
utterly
to
demolish
their
opponents
they
remind
me
of
a
couple
of
tough
gentlemen
from
scranton
i
heard
about
in
a
story
once
the
price
of
fags
gee
i
getting
rough
has
gone
up
again
this
war
is
rapidly
cramping
my
style
i
have
been
too
sick
at
heart
to
write
up
my
diary
eli
is
dead
pop
the
found
the
body
and
has
been
promoted
to
chief
it
an
ill
wind
that
blows
no
good
i
do
know
whether
it
was
because
he
found
eli
or
because
he
runs
one
of
the
most
modernly
managed
mess
halls
in
camp
or
because
his
working
parties
are
always
well
attended
that
pop
received
his
appointment
but
whatever
it
was
it
does
my
heart
good
to
see
a
real
seagoing
old
salt
one
of
our
few
remaining
boys
receive
recognition
that
is
so
well
merited
however
i
was
on
much
more
intimate
terms
with
eli
when
i
was
over
in
probation
camp
than
i
was
with
pop
he
almost
had
me
in
his
clutches
once
for
late
hammocks
me
and
eight
other
poor
victims
i
had
led
into
the
trouble
and
he
had
our
wheelbarrows
all
picked
out
for
us
and
a
nice
large
pile
of
sand
for
us
to
play
with
when
fate
interceded
in
our
behalf
the
poor
man
nearly
cried
out
of
sheer
anguish
of
soul
and
i
ca
justly
blame
him
it
hard
lines
to
have
a
nice
fat
extra
duty
party
go
dead
on
your
hands
but
with
eli
it
was
different
when
i
was
a
homeless
rookie
he
took
me
in
and
i
fed
him
cigarette
butts
and
i
honestly
say
that
he
showed
more
genuine
appreciation
than
many
a
flapper
i
have
plied
with
costly
viands
he
was
a
good
goat
eli
not
a
refined
goat
to
be
sure
but
a
good
honest
goat
just
the
same
he
did
his
share
in
policing
the
grounds
never
shirked
a
cigar
end
or
a
bit
of
paper
and
amused
many
a
mess
gear
line
he
was
loyal
to
his
friends
tolerant
with
new
recruits
and
a
credit
to
the
service
in
general
considering
the
environment
in
which
he
lived
i
think
he
deported
himself
with
much
dignity
and
moderation
i
for
one
shall
miss
eli
some
of
the
happier
memories
of
my
rookie
days
die
with
him
he
is
survived
by
numerous
dogs
yesterday
i
wandered
around
probation
camp
in
a
very
patronizing
manner
and
finally
stopped
to
shed
a
tear
on
the
humble
grave
of
eli
poor
sinful
goat
i
thought
sadly
here
you
lie
at
last
in
your
final
resting
place
but
your
phantom
i
wonder
does
it
go
coursing
madly
down
the
milky
way
butting
the
stars
aside
with
its
head
and
sending
swift
gleams
of
light
through
the
heavens
as
its
hoofs
strike
against
an
upturned
planet
your
horns
are
they
tipped
with
fire
and
your
beard
gloriously
aflame
or
has
the
great
evil
spirit
of
wayward
goats
descended
upon
you
and
borne
you
away
to
a
place
where
there
is
never
anything
to
butt
save
unsatisfactorily
yielding
walls
of
padded
cotton
many
changes
have
taken
place
eli
since
you
were
with
us
much
adversity
has
befallen
me
but
the
world
in
the
large
is
very
much
the
same
bill
and
mike
have
been
shipped
to
sea
and
strange
enough
to
say
old
spike
kelly
has
made
the
quartermasters
school
i
alone
of
all
the
gang
remain
unspoken
for
nobody
seems
anxious
to
avail
themselves
of
my
services
my
tapes
are
dirtier
and
my
white
hat
grows
less
every
day
and
even
you
eli
are
being
forgotten
the
company
commander
still
carols
sweetly
in
the
morning
about
barrackses
and
fire
distinguishers
rookies
still
continue
to
rook
about
the
camp
in
their
timid
way
while
sailors
with
unwashed
leggins
delight
their
simple
souls
with
cries
of
days
new
goats
have
sprung
up
to
take
your
place
in
the
life
of
the
camp
and
belittle
your
past
achievements
but
to
me
o
unregenerate
goat
you
shall
ever
remain
a
refreshing
memory
good
butting
o
excellent
ruminant
wherever
thou
should
chance
to
be
i
salute
you
this
soliloquy
brought
me
to
the
verge
of
an
emotional
i
departed
the
spot
in
silence
on
my
way
back
through
probation
i
chanced
upon
a
group
of
rookies
studying
for
their
examinations
and
was
surprised
to
remember
how
much
i
had
contrived
to
forget
nevertheless
i
stopped
one
of
the
students
and
asked
him
what
a
hakamaback
was
and
found
to
my
relief
that
he
did
know
back
to
your
manual
said
i
gloomily
i
fear
you
will
never
be
a
sailor
having
thus
made
heavy
the
heart
of
another
i
continued
on
my
way
feeling
somehow
greatly
cheered
only
to
find
upon
entering
my
barracks
that
my
blankets
were
in
the
lucky
bag
how
did
i
ever
forget
to
place
them
in
my
hammock
it
was
a
natural
omission
though
i
fancy
for
the
so
terrifies
me
in
the
morning
with
his
great
shouts
of
hit
the
deck
sailor
shake
a
leg
rise
an
shine
that
i
am
unnerved
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
life
seems
to
be
composed
of
just
one
parade
after
another
i
am
weary
of
the
plaudits
and
acclamation
of
the
multitude
and
long
for
some
sequestered
spot
on
a
mountain
peak
in
thibet
every
time
i
see
a
street
i
instinctively
start
to
walk
down
the
middle
of
it
last
week
i
was
one
of
the
many
thousands
of
pelham
men
who
marched
along
fifth
avenue
in
the
liberty
loan
parade
i
thought
i
was
doing
particularly
well
and
would
have
made
a
perfect
score
if
one
of
my
leggins
had
come
off
right
in
front
of
the
reviewing
stand
much
to
the
annoyance
of
the
guy
behind
me
because
he
tripped
on
it
and
almost
dropped
his
gun
for
the
remainder
of
the
parade
i
was
subjected
to
a
running
fire
of
abuse
that
fairly
made
my
flesh
crawl
at
the
end
of
the
march
i
ran
into
a
rather
nebulous
sort
of
a
gentleman
soldier
who
was
sitting
on
the
curb
looking
moodily
at
a
manhole
as
if
he
would
like
to
jump
in
it
hello
stranger
says
i
in
a
blustery
seafaring
voice
you
look
as
if
you
been
cursed
at
about
as
much
as
i
have
what
sort
of
an
outfit
do
you
belong
to
he
scrutinized
one
of
his
buttons
with
great
care
and
then
told
me
all
about
himself
i
a
home
guard
you
know
he
added
bitterly
all
we
do
is
to
escort
people
i
escorted
the
blue
devils
the
poilus
the
australians
mothers
of
enlisted
men
mothers
of
men
who
would
have
enlisted
if
they
could
boy
scouts
and
loan
workers
until
my
dogs
are
jolly
well
near
broken
down
on
me
golly
i
wish
i
was
young
enough
to
enjoy
a
quiet
night
sleep
in
the
trenches
for
a
change
later
i
saw
him
gloomily
surveying
the
world
from
the
window
of
a
passing
cab
he
was
evidently
through
for
the
time
being
at
least
i
took
my
pal
home
over
the
last
liberty
it
was
a
mistake
he
admits
it
himself
mother
will
never
have
him
in
the
house
again
mother
could
never
get
him
in
the
house
again
he
fears
her
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
mix
poor
dear
grandfather
a
drink
that
caused
the
old
gentleman
to
forget
his
game
leg
which
had
been
damaged
in
battles
ranging
anywhere
from
the
mexican
to
the
spanish
wars
according
to
grandfather
mood
at
the
time
he
is
telling
the
story
but
which
i
believe
according
to
a
private
theory
of
mine
was
really
caught
in
a
folding
bed
however
it
was
grandfather
forgot
all
about
this
leg
of
his
entirely
and
insisted
on
dancing
with
nora
our
new
maid
mother
of
course
was
horrified
but
not
content
with
that
this
friend
of
mine
concocted
some
strange
beverage
for
the
pater
which
so
delighted
him
that
he
loaned
my
pal
the
ten
spot
i
had
been
intending
to
borrow
the
three
of
them
sat
up
until
all
hours
of
the
night
playing
cards
and
telling
ribald
stories
as
mother
took
me
upstairs
to
bed
she
gazed
down
on
her
and
her
husband
in
the
clutches
of
this
demon
and
remarked
bitterly
to
me
like
father
like
son
and
i
knew
that
she
was
thoroughly
determined
to
make
both
of
them
pay
dearly
for
their
pleasant
interlude
breakfast
the
next
morning
was
a
rather
trying
ordeal
grandfather
once
more
resorted
to
his
game
leg
with
renewed
vigor
referring
several
times
to
the
defense
of
the
alamo
so
i
knew
he
was
pretty
low
in
his
mind
father
withdrew
at
the
sight
of
bacon
mother
laughed
scornfully
as
he
departed
my
friend
ate
a
hearty
breakfast
and
kept
a
sort
of
a
monologue
throughout
its
entire
course
i
took
him
out
walking
afterward
and
forgot
to
bring
him
back
illustration
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
mix
poor
dear
grandfather
a
drink
have
just
come
off
guard
duty
and
feel
quite
exhausted
the
guns
are
altogether
too
heavy
i
can
think
of
about
five
different
things
i
could
remove
from
them
without
greatly
decreasing
their
utility
the
first
would
be
the
barrel
the
artist
who
drew
the
picture
in
the
last
camp
paper
of
dawn
appearing
in
the
form
of
a
beautiful
woman
must
have
had
more
luck
than
i
have
ever
had
i
think
he
would
have
been
closer
to
the
truth
if
he
had
put
her
in
a
speeding
automobile
on
its
way
home
from
a
road
house
it
surely
is
a
proof
of
discipline
to
hear
the
mocking
laughter
of
women
ring
out
in
the
night
only
ten
feet
away
and
not
drop
your
gun
and
follow
it
right
through
the
barbed
wire
after
the
war
i
am
going
to
buy
lots
of
barbed
wire
and
cut
it
up
into
little
bits
just
to
relieve
my
feelings
last
night
i
had
the
fright
of
my
life
some
one
was
fooling
around
the
fence
in
the
darkness
who
there
i
cried
why
i
kaiser
william
came
the
answer
in
a
subdued
voice
well
i
wish
you
go
away
kaiser
william
said
i
nervously
you
busting
the
lights
out
of
rule
number
six
what
that
asks
the
voice
not
to
commit
a
nuisance
with
any
one
except
in
a
military
manner
i
replied
becoming
slightly
involved
that
not
such
a
wonderful
rule
came
back
the
voice
in
complaining
tones
i
could
make
up
a
rule
better
than
that
do
try
to
i
pleaded
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
the
voice
continued
seriously
say
i
not
kaiser
william
really
honest
i
not
well
who
are
you
i
asked
impatiently
why
i
tucks
the
voice
replied
folks
call
me
that
because
i
take
so
many
of
them
in
my
trousers
well
tucks
i
replied
you
better
be
moving
on
i
do
know
what
might
happen
with
this
gun
i
tempted
to
shoot
the
cartridge
out
of
it
just
to
make
it
lighter
oh
you
ca
shoot
me
cried
tucks
i
crazy
i
bet
you
know
that
did
you
i
was
sure
i
answered
oh
i
awfully
crazy
continued
tucks
everybody
says
so
and
i
look
it
too
in
the
daylight
you
must
i
replied
well
good
night
said
tucks
in
the
same
subdued
voice
if
you
find
a
flock
of
pink
liberty
bonds
around
here
remember
i
lost
them
he
departed
in
the
direction
of
city
island
illustration
i
was
tempted
to
shoot
the
cartridge
out
just
to
make
it
lighter
i
visited
the
office
of
the
camp
paper
and
found
it
to
be
an
extremely
hectic
place
in
the
course
of
a
conversation
with
the
chief
i
chanced
to
look
up
and
caught
two
shining
eyes
staring
malevolently
at
me
from
a
darkened
corner
of
the
room
this
creature
blinked
at
me
several
times
very
rapidly
wiggled
its
mustache
and
suddenly
disappeared
into
the
thick
shadows
who
is
that
i
cried
startled
that
our
mad
photographer
said
the
chief
what
do
you
think
of
him
do
you
keep
him
in
there
i
asked
pointing
to
the
room
into
which
this
strange
creature
had
disappeared
yes
said
the
chief
and
he
likes
it
often
he
stays
there
for
days
at
a
time
only
coming
out
for
air
at
this
juncture
there
came
from
the
dark
room
the
sounds
of
breaking
glass
which
was
immediately
followed
by
strange
sounds
as
the
mad
photographer
burst
out
of
his
den
and
proclaimed
to
all
the
world
that
nothing
meant
very
much
in
his
life
and
that
it
would
be
absolutely
immaterial
to
him
if
the
paper
and
its
entire
staff
should
suddenly
be
visited
with
flood
fire
and
famine
after
this
gracious
and
purely
gratuitous
piece
of
information
he
again
withdrew
but
strange
mutterings
still
continued
to
issue
forth
from
his
lair
while
i
was
sitting
in
the
office
the
editor
happened
to
drift
in
from
the
adjacent
room
crisply
attired
in
a
pair
of
ragged
disreputable
trousers
and
a
sleeveless
gray
sweater
which
was
raveling
in
numerous
places
it
was
the
shock
of
my
life
where
our
yeoman
he
grumbled
at
which
the
yeoman
who
somehow
reminded
me
of
some
character
from
one
of
dickens
novels
edged
out
of
the
door
but
he
was
too
late
spying
him
the
editor
launched
forth
on
a
violent
denunciation
in
which
for
no
particular
reason
the
cartoonist
and
sporting
editor
joined
there
they
stood
the
three
of
them
abusing
this
poor
simple
yeoman
in
the
most
unnecessary
manner
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
three
harder
i
have
never
encountered
while
in
the
office
i
came
upon
a
rather
elderly
artist
crouched
over
in
a
corner
writhing
as
if
he
was
in
great
pain
he
was
in
the
throes
of
composition
i
was
told
and
he
looked
it
poor
wretch
he
seemed
to
have
something
on
his
mind
the
only
man
i
saw
who
seemed
to
have
anything
like
a
balanced
mind
was
the
financial
shark
a
little
cuss
whom
i
would
have
trusted
out
of
my
sight
he
was
sitting
with
his
nose
thrust
in
some
dusty
volume
totally
oblivious
of
the
pandemonium
that
reigned
around
him
he
either
has
a
great
mind
or
none
at
all
probably
the
latter
i
fear
i
would
never
make
an
editor
the
atmosphere
is
simply
altogether
too
strenuous
for
me
there
seems
to
be
no
place
in
the
service
for
me
i
can
not
decide
what
rating
to
select
to
be
a
quartermaster
one
must
know
how
to
signal
and
signaling
always
tires
my
arms
one
must
know
how
to
blow
a
horrid
shrill
little
whistle
in
order
to
become
a
boatswain
mate
and
my
ears
could
never
stand
this
to
be
a
yeoman
it
is
necessary
to
know
how
to
rattle
papers
in
an
important
manner
and
disseminate
misinformation
with
a
straight
face
and
this
i
could
never
do
i
fear
the
only
thing
left
for
me
is
to
try
for
a
commission
i
sure
i
would
be
a
valuable
addition
to
any
wardroom
man
the
drags
hey
there
you
camel
stop
galloping
what
are
you
doing
anyway
playing
horses
do
be
ridiculous
i
cried
out
hot
with
rage
and
humiliation
you
know
perfectly
well
i
not
playing
horse
i
realize
as
well
as
you
do
that
this
is
a
serious
at
this
juncture
of
my
brave
retort
a
gun
barrel
stove
in
the
back
of
my
head
some
one
kicked
me
on
the
shin
and
in
some
indescribable
manner
the
butt
of
a
rifle
became
entangled
between
my
feet
and
down
i
went
in
a
cloud
of
dust
and
oaths
of
the
entire
pelham
field
artillery
passed
over
my
body
together
with
its
crew
while
through
the
roar
and
confusion
raised
by
this
horrible
cataclysm
i
could
hear
innumerable
howling
and
blackguarding
me
in
frenzied
tones
and
i
dimly
distinguished
their
forms
dancing
in
rage
amid
descending
billows
of
dust
the
parade
ground
swirled
dizzily
around
me
but
i
had
no
desire
to
arise
and
begin
life
anew
it
would
not
be
worth
while
i
felt
that
i
had
at
the
most
only
a
short
time
to
live
and
that
that
was
too
long
the
world
offered
nothing
but
the
most
horrifying
possibilities
to
me
what
is
the
biltmore
to
a
man
in
uniform
anyway
i
remember
thinking
to
myself
as
i
lay
there
with
my
nose
pressed
flat
to
an
ant
hill
all
the
best
parts
of
it
are
arid
districts
waste
places
limitless
saharas
to
him
death
where
is
thy
sting
i
continued
as
an
outraged
ant
assaulted
my
nose
the
world
came
throbbing
back
i
felt
myself
being
dragged
violently
away
from
my
resting
place
i
was
choking
bidding
farewell
to
the
ants
i
prepared
myself
to
swoon
when
gradually
as
if
from
a
great
distance
i
heard
the
voice
of
my
he
was
almost
crying
take
him
out
he
pleaded
for
gord
sake
take
him
out
he
our
gun
illustration
one
fourth
of
the
entire
pelham
field
artillery
passed
over
my
body
this
remark
gave
me
the
strength
to
rise
but
not
gracefully
my
intention
was
to
address
a
few
handpicked
words
to
this
of
mine
but
fortunately
for
my
future
peace
of
mind
i
was
beyond
utterance
weakly
i
tottered
in
the
direction
of
the
gun
hoping
to
support
myself
upon
it
hey
come
away
from
that
gun
howled
the
do
let
him
touch
it
fellers
he
pleaded
do
let
him
even
go
near
it
he
spoil
it
he
completely
destroy
it
say
buddy
said
the
chief
to
me
and
how
i
hated
the
ignominy
of
the
word
i
guess
i
take
you
out
of
the
game
for
responsible
for
government
property
and
you
are
altogether
too
big
a
risk
what
shall
i
do
i
asked
huskily
where
shall
i
go
do
he
repeated
in
a
thoughtful
voice
go
well
here
where
you
can
go
and
he
told
me
and
this
is
what
you
can
do
when
you
get
there
and
as
i
departed
rather
hastily
he
told
me
this
also
the
entire
parade
ground
heard
him
how
shall
i
ever
be
able
to
hold
up
my
head
again
in
camp
i
departed
the
spot
but
only
under
one
boiler
however
i
made
fair
speed
like
a
soldier
returning
from
a
week
in
the
trenches
i
sought
the
comfort
and
seclusion
of
the
here
i
witnessed
a
checker
contest
of
a
low
order
between
two
unscrupulous
brothers
they
had
a
peculiar
technique
completely
their
own
it
consisted
of
arts
and
dodges
and
an
extravagant
use
of
those
adjectives
one
is
commonly
supposed
to
shun
say
there
a
queen
down
at
the
end
of
the
room
one
of
them
would
suddenly
exclaim
and
while
the
other
brother
was
gazing
eagerly
in
that
direction
he
would
deliberately
remove
several
of
his
men
from
the
board
but
the
other
brother
who
was
not
so
balmy
as
he
looked
would
occasionally
discover
this
slight
irregularity
and
proceed
to
express
his
opinion
of
it
by
word
of
mouth
which
for
sheer
force
of
expression
was
in
the
nature
of
a
revelation
to
me
it
was
appalling
to
sit
there
and
watch
those
two
young
men
who
had
evidently
at
one
time
come
from
a
good
home
sit
in
god
bright
sunshine
and
cheat
each
other
throughout
the
course
of
an
afternoon
and
lie
out
of
it
in
the
most
obvious
manner
the
game
was
finally
discontinued
owing
to
a
shortage
of
checkermen
which
they
had
secreted
in
their
pockets
a
fact
which
each
one
stoutly
denied
with
many
weird
and
rather
indelicate
vows
i
left
them
engaged
in
the
pleasant
game
of
recrimination
which
had
to
do
with
stolen
golf
balls
the
holding
out
of
change
and
kindred
sordid
subjects
in
my
weakened
condition
this
display
of
fraternal
depravity
so
offended
my
instinctive
sense
of
honor
that
i
was
forced
to
retire
behind
the
protecting
pages
of
a
issue
of
the
farmer
wife
indispensable
companion
where
i
managed
to
lose
myself
for
the
time
in
a
rather
complicated
exposition
of
how
to
tell
which
chicken
laid
what
egg
if
any
or
something
to
that
effect
an
article
that
utterly
demolished
the
moral
character
of
the
average
hen
leaving
her
hardly
a
leg
to
roost
on
give
away
said
the
coxswain
when
we
were
struggling
to
get
our
cutter
off
from
the
pier
and
i
gave
away
to
such
an
extent
in
fact
that
i
suddenly
found
myself
balanced
cleverly
on
the
back
of
my
neck
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
so
that
i
experienced
the
rather
odd
sensation
of
feeling
the
hot
sun
on
the
soles
of
my
feet
this
procedure
of
course
did
not
go
unnoticed
nothing
i
do
goes
unnoticed
save
the
good
things
the
coxswain
made
a
few
comments
which
showed
him
to
be
a
thoroughly
person
but
further
than
this
i
was
not
persecuted
after
we
had
rowed
interminable
distances
through
leagues
upon
leagues
of
doggedly
resisting
water
a
man
in
the
bow
remarked
casually
that
he
had
several
friends
in
florida
we
might
call
upon
if
we
kept
it
up
a
little
longer
but
the
coxswain
comfortably
ensconced
upon
the
hackamatack
was
so
deeply
engrossed
in
the
perusal
of
a
vest
pocket
edition
of
the
merchant
of
venice
that
he
failed
to
grasp
the
full
meaning
of
the
remark
i
lifted
my
rapidly
glazing
eyes
with
no
little
effort
from
the
keelson
and
discovered
to
my
horror
that
we
had
hardly
passed
more
than
half
a
mile
of
at
the
most
what
we
had
been
doing
all
the
time
i
was
unable
to
figure
out
i
thought
we
had
been
rowing
i
could
have
sworn
we
had
been
rowing
but
apparently
we
had
not
i
looked
up
from
my
meditation
in
time
to
catch
the
ironical
gaze
of
the
coxswain
upon
me
and
i
involuntarily
braced
myself
to
the
assault
illustration
the
procedure
of
course
did
not
go
unnoticed
say
there
sailor
said
he
with
a
slow
unpleasant
drawl
not
rowing
you
weaving
it
fancy
work
you
doing
blast
yer
eyes
all
who
had
sufficient
strength
left
in
them
laughed
jeeringly
at
this
wise
observation
but
i
retained
a
dignified
silence
that
is
so
far
as
a
man
panting
from
exhaustion
can
be
silent
at
this
moment
we
passed
a
small
boat
being
rowed
briskly
along
by
a
not
unattractive
girl
now
watch
her
said
the
coxswain
helpfully
to
me
study
the
way
that
poor
fragile
girl
that
mere
child
pulls
the
oars
and
try
to
do
likewise
i
observed
in
shamed
silence
my
hands
ached
a
motor
boat
slid
swiftly
by
and
i
distinctly
saw
a
man
drinking
beer
from
the
bottle
hell
is
dark
and
smoky
thought
i
to
myself
hell
is
bright
and
sunny
and
there
is
lots
of
sparkling
water
in
it
and
on
the
sparkling
water
are
innumerable
boats
and
in
these
boats
are
huddled
the
poor
lost
mortals
who
are
forced
to
listen
through
eternity
to
the
wise
cracks
of
coxswains
that
what
hell
is
thought
i
and
i
am
in
my
probation
period
right
now
feather
your
oars
suddenly
screamed
our
master
at
the
straining
crew
feather
me
eye
yelled
back
a
courageous
irishman
what
do
you
think
these
oars
are
anyway
a
flock
of
humming
birds
whoever
heard
of
feathering
a
weight
feather
pike
peak
say
i
just
as
easy
somehow
we
got
back
to
the
pier
but
i
was
almost
delirious
by
this
time
the
last
part
of
the
trip
was
all
one
drab
dull
nightmare
to
me
this
evening
my
hands
were
so
swollen
i
was
forced
to
the
extremity
of
bribing
a
friend
to
hold
the
telephone
receiver
for
me
when
i
called
up
mother
what
have
you
been
doing
she
asked
rowing
came
my
short
answer
what
a
splendid
outing
she
exclaimed
you
had
such
a
lovely
day
for
it
did
you
dear
hang
up
that
receiver
i
shouted
to
my
friend
hang
it
up
or
my
mother
shall
hear
from
the
lips
of
her
son
words
she
should
only
hear
from
her
husband
i
am
just
after
having
been
killed
in
a
sham
battle
and
so
consequently
i
feel
rather
ghastly
i
do
exactly
know
whether
i
was
a
red
or
a
blue
because
i
did
a
deal
of
fighting
on
both
sides
but
always
with
the
same
result
i
was
killed
instantly
and
completely
people
got
sick
of
putting
me
out
of
my
misery
after
a
while
and
i
was
allowed
to
wander
around
at
large
in
a
state
of
great
mystification
and
excitement
shooting
my
blank
bullets
into
the
face
of
nature
in
an
aimless
sort
of
manner
whenever
the
battle
began
to
pall
upon
me
most
of
the
time
i
passed
pleasantly
on
the
soft
fresh
flank
of
a
hill
where
for
a
while
i
slept
until
a
cow
breathed
heavily
in
my
face
and
reminded
me
that
it
was
war
after
all
my
instructions
were
to
keep
away
from
the
guns
and
get
killed
as
soon
as
possible
as
these
instructions
were
not
difficult
to
follow
i
carried
them
out
to
the
letter
i
stayed
away
from
the
guns
and
i
permitted
myself
to
be
killed
several
times
in
order
to
make
sure
it
would
take
after
that
i
became
a
sort
of
composite
camp
follower
deserter
and
straggler
in
my
wandering
i
chanced
upon
an
ancient
enemy
of
many
past
encounters
are
you
red
or
blue
i
asked
preparing
to
die
for
the
fifth
time
no
he
answered
sarcastically
i
what
you
might
call
elephant
ear
gray
are
you
the
guy
the
reporter
for
the
camp
paper
was
referring
to
in
his
last
story
i
asked
him
yes
he
replied
the
slandering
blackguard
you
hit
me
on
the
nose
with
a
said
i
i
do
it
again
said
he
that
reporter
evidently
a
man
of
some
observation
said
you
wash
your
neck
and
that
you
had
the
habits
of
a
camel
but
i
do
wash
my
neck
he
said
stubbornly
and
i
do
know
anything
about
the
habits
of
a
camel
but
whatever
they
might
happen
to
be
i
have
got
yes
i
replied
as
if
to
myself
you
certainly
should
wash
your
neck
that
the
very
least
you
could
do
but
i
tell
you
he
cried
desperately
i
keep
telling
you
that
i
do
wash
my
neck
why
do
you
go
on
talking
about
it
as
if
i
did
i
tell
you
now
once
for
all
time
that
i
do
wash
my
neck
and
that
ends
it
do
talk
any
more
i
want
to
think
we
sat
in
silence
for
a
space
then
i
remarked
casually
almost
inaudibly
and
you
certainly
should
have
the
habits
of
a
camel
the
depraved
creature
stirred
uneasily
i
ai
got
he
said
good
i
cried
heartily
we
understand
each
other
perfectly
in
the
future
you
will
try
to
wash
your
neck
and
cease
from
having
the
habits
of
a
camel
no
compromise
is
necessary
i
know
you
will
keep
your
word
go
away
quickly
he
gasped
searching
around
for
a
stone
to
hurl
at
me
and
discarding
several
because
of
their
small
size
go
away
to
somewhere
else
i
telling
you
now
go
away
or
else
a
special
detail
will
find
your
lifeless
body
here
in
the
bushes
some
time
i
already
been
thoroughly
killed
several
times
i
said
putting
a
tree
between
us
but
do
forget
about
the
camel
and
for
heaven
sake
do
try
to
keep
your
neck
a
stone
hit
the
tree
with
a
resounding
crack
and
i
increased
the
distance
damn
the
torpedoes
i
shouted
back
as
i
disappeared
into
the
pleasant
security
of
the
woods
what
navy
do
you
belong
to
asked
an
ensign
stopping
me
the
chinese
why
do
you
ask
sir
i
replied
saluting
gracefully
of
course
i
do
belong
to
the
chinese
navy
what
your
rating
he
snapped
show
girl
first
class
attached
to
the
good
ship
biff
bang
sir
came
my
prompt
retort
well
put
a
watch
mark
on
your
arm
sailor
and
put
it
there
pronto
or
you
be
needing
an
understudy
to
pinch
hit
for
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
never
put
my
watch
mark
on
for
the
simple
reason
that
i
have
been
rather
expecting
a
rating
at
any
moment
but
it
seems
as
if
my
expectations
were
doomed
to
disappointment
nothing
matters
much
anyway
now
however
for
i
have
been
selected
from
among
all
the
men
in
the
station
to
play
the
part
of
a
show
girl
in
the
coming
magnificent
pelham
production
biff
bang
at
last
i
have
found
the
occupation
to
which
by
training
and
inclination
i
am
naturally
adapted
the
grand
moguls
that
are
running
this
show
came
around
the
barracks
the
other
day
looking
for
material
and
when
they
gazed
upon
me
i
felt
sure
that
their
search
had
not
been
in
vain
why
do
you
write
a
part
for
him
asked
one
of
them
of
the
playwright
as
they
surveyed
me
critically
as
if
i
was
some
rare
specimen
of
bug
life
that
would
never
do
he
answered
real
can
never
play
the
part
on
the
stage
you
got
to
have
a
man
of
intelligence
look
here
i
broke
in
you
got
to
stop
talking
about
me
before
my
face
as
if
i
was
really
present
nuts
i
may
be
but
i
can
still
understand
english
even
when
badly
spoken
and
resent
it
lay
off
that
stuff
or
i
be
constrained
to
introduce
you
to
a
new
brand
of
bang
saying
this
i
struck
an
heroic
attitude
but
it
seemed
to
produce
no
startling
change
in
their
calm
deliberate
examination
of
me
he
do
i
think
as
a
show
girl
the
mused
dreamily
like
a
cabbage
every
one
of
his
features
is
bad
but
the
whole
effect
is
not
revolting
strange
is
it
how
such
things
happen
at
this
point
the
musician
broke
in
he
ai
agoing
to
dance
to
my
music
if
i
know
it
he
ruin
it
at
which
remark
i
executed
a
few
rather
simple
but
nevertheless
neat
steps
i
had
learned
at
the
last
charity
bazaar
to
which
i
had
contributed
my
services
and
these
few
steps
were
sufficient
to
close
the
deal
i
was
signed
up
on
the
spot
as
they
were
leaving
the
barracks
one
excited
young
person
ran
up
and
halted
the
arrogant
thespians
if
i
get
the
doctor
to
remove
my
adam
apple
he
pleaded
wistfully
do
you
think
you
could
take
me
on
as
a
pony
no
said
one
of
them
not
without
a
certain
show
of
kindness
i
fear
not
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
remove
the
greater
part
of
your
map
and
graft
a
couple
of
pounds
on
to
your
sadly
unendowed
limbs
from
that
day
on
my
life
has
become
one
of
unremitting
toil
together
with
the
rest
of
the
show
girls
i
vamp
and
slouch
my
way
around
the
clock
with
ever
increasing
seductiveness
we
are
really
doing
splendidly
the
ponies
come
leaping
lightly
across
the
floor
waving
their
freckled
muscular
arms
from
side
to
side
and
looking
very
unattractive
indeed
in
their
high
shoes
and
sock
supporters
i
can
see
it
all
says
the
director
in
an
enthusiastic
voice
and
if
he
can
i
admit
he
has
some
robust
quality
of
imagination
that
i
fail
to
possess
us
show
girls
of
course
have
to
be
a
little
more
modest
than
the
ponies
so
we
retain
our
white
trousers
these
are
rolled
up
however
in
order
to
afford
the
mosquitoes
who
are
covering
the
show
most
conscientiously
room
to
roost
on
and
sad
to
relate
the
life
is
beginning
to
affect
the
boys
only
yesterday
i
saw
one
of
our
toughest
ponies
vamping
up
the
aisle
of
mess
hall
no
with
his
tray
held
over
his
head
in
the
manner
of
a
persian
slave
girl
the
witnessing
this
strange
sight
dropped
his
jaw
and
forgot
to
lift
it
up
again
sweet
attar
of
roses
he
muttered
what
ever
has
happened
to
our
poor
navy
at
the
door
of
the
mess
hall
the
pony
bowed
low
to
the
deck
and
withdrew
with
a
coy
backward
flirt
of
his
foot
i
ca
express
in
words
the
remarkable
appearance
made
by
some
of
our
seagoing
chorus
girls
when
they
attempt
to
assume
the
light
and
airy
graces
of
the
real
article
some
of
the
men
have
so
deeply
entered
into
their
parts
that
they
have
attained
absolute
with
the
result
that
they
leap
and
preen
about
in
a
manner
quite
startling
to
the
dispassionate
spectator
my
career
so
far
has
not
been
a
personal
triumph
in
the
middle
of
a
number
the
other
night
the
dancing
master
clapped
his
hands
violently
together
a
signal
he
uses
when
he
wants
all
motion
to
cease
take
down
to
the
end
of
the
room
boys
he
said
i
can
tell
three
minutes
ahead
of
time
when
things
are
going
to
go
wrong
that
man
on
the
end
did
have
a
thought
in
his
head
he
would
have
smeared
the
entire
number
i
was
the
man
on
the
end
this
has
not
been
a
particularly
agreeable
day
although
to
a
woman
no
doubt
it
would
have
been
laden
with
moments
of
exquisite
ecstasy
feminine
apparel
for
me
has
lost
for
ever
the
charm
of
mystery
that
formerly
touched
it
with
enchantment
there
is
nothing
i
do
not
know
now
its
innermost
secret
has
been
revealed
and
its
revelation
has
brought
with
it
its
full
burden
of
woe
all
knowledge
is
pain
and
vice
versa
i
have
always
admired
women
whether
so
profoundly
as
they
have
admired
me
i
know
not
however
that
may
be
i
have
always
admired
them
collectively
and
individually
in
the
past
but
after
today
experience
my
admiration
is
tinged
with
pity
the
source
of
these
reflections
lies
in
no
less
an
article
than
a
corset
as
a
show
girl
it
has
been
my
lot
to
be
provided
with
one
of
these
fiendish
devices
of
medieval
days
it
is
too
much
the
corset
must
go
no
woman
could
have
experienced
the
pain
and
discomfort
i
have
been
subjected
to
this
day
without
feeling
entitled
to
the
vote
yet
i
dare
say
there
are
women
who
would
gladly
be
poured
into
a
new
corset
every
day
of
their
lives
they
can
have
mine
for
the
asking
life
at
its
best
presents
a
narrow
enough
outlook
without
resorting
to
cunningly
wrought
devices
such
as
corsets
in
order
further
to
confine
point
of
view
or
abdomen
which
amounts
to
the
same
thing
the
whale
is
a
noble
animal
it
was
a
very
good
idea
the
whale
and
i
love
every
bone
in
its
body
so
long
as
it
keeps
them
there
so
tightly
was
my
body
clutched
in
the
embrace
of
this
vicious
contraption
that
i
found
it
impossible
to
inhale
my
much
needed
cigarette
the
smoke
would
descend
no
further
than
my
throat
the
rest
of
me
was
a
closed
port
a
roadway
blocked
to
traffic
i
have
suffered
but
there
were
also
other
devices
other
soft
seductive
under
strappings
i
know
them
all
to
their
last
most
intimate
detail
i
feel
that
now
i
could
join
a
woman
sewing
circle
and
talk
with
as
much
authority
and
wisdom
as
the
most
veteraned
corset
wearer
present
my
views
would
be
radical
perhaps
but
at
least
they
would
have
the
virtue
of
being
refreshing
however
i
can
see
some
good
coming
out
of
my
unavoidably
acquired
knowledge
of
female
attire
in
future
days
while
my
wife
is
out
purchasing
shirts
and
neckties
for
me
i
can
easily
employ
my
time
to
advantage
in
shopping
around
fifth
avenue
in
search
of
the
correct
thing
in
lingerie
for
her
it
will
be
a
great
help
to
the
household
and
i
am
sure
impress
my
wife
with
the
depth
and
range
of
my
education
which
i
will
be
able
to
tell
her
thank
god
was
innocently
acquired
i
am
slowly
forming
back
into
my
pristine
shape
but
only
after
having
been
freed
from
bondage
for
some
hours
after
several
more
sodas
concoctions
which
up
till
recently
i
have
despised
as
injurious
i
guess
i
will
have
filled
out
to
my
usual
dimensions
around
the
waist
line
but
when
i
consider
the
long
days
of
womanhood
stretched
out
before
me
in
the
future
i
will
admit
it
is
with
a
sinking
not
only
of
the
waist
but
also
of
the
heart
more
indignities
have
been
heaped
upon
me
why
did
i
ever
take
up
the
profession
of
a
show
girl
i
fell
into
the
clutches
of
the
barbers
they
were
not
gentle
clutches
brutal
rather
and
such
an
outspoken
lot
they
were
at
that
what
that
asked
one
of
them
as
i
stood
rather
nervously
before
him
with
bared
chest
why
that
i
replied
a
trifle
disconcerted
that
my
chest
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
then
smiled
a
slow
pitying
smile
hey
tony
he
suddenly
called
to
his
colleague
come
over
here
a
moment
and
see
what
this
bird
claims
to
be
a
chest
all
this
yelled
in
the
faces
of
the
entire
company
it
was
more
inhuman
and
debasing
than
my
first
physical
examination
in
public
the
doctors
on
this
occasion
although
they
had
not
complimented
me
had
at
least
been
comparatively
impersonal
in
despatching
their
offices
but
these
men
were
far
from
being
impersonal
i
perceived
with
horror
that
it
was
their
intention
to
use
my
chest
as
a
means
of
bringing
humor
into
their
drab
existences
tony
came
and
surveyed
me
critically
that
he
drawled
musically
ees
not
a
chest
that
ees
the
bottom
part
of
hees
neck
i
know
it
is
replied
the
other
but
somehow
his
arms
have
gotten
mixed
up
in
the
middle
of
it
tony
shrugged
his
shoulders
eloquently
he
assumed
the
appearance
of
a
man
completely
baffled
honestly
now
young
feller
continued
my
first
tormentor
are
you
serious
when
you
try
to
tell
us
that
that
is
your
chest
he
drew
attention
to
the
highly
disputed
territory
by
poking
me
diligently
with
his
thumb
that
the
part
the
doctor
always
listened
to
whenever
i
had
a
cold
i
replied
as
indifferently
as
possible
the
man
pondered
over
this
for
a
moment
well
he
replied
at
length
probably
the
doctor
was
right
but
to
the
impartial
observer
it
would
seem
to
be
as
my
friend
tony
so
accurately
observed
the
bottom
part
of
your
neck
it
really
does
matter
much
after
all
i
replied
hoping
to
close
the
conversation
you
all
were
not
sent
here
to
establish
the
location
of
the
different
parts
of
my
anatomy
anyway
the
man
appeared
not
to
have
heard
me
i
swear
he
murmured
musingly
standing
back
and
regarding
me
with
tilted
head
i
swear
it
was
his
neck
if
it
war
for
his
arms
he
suddenly
discontinued
his
dreamy
observations
and
became
all
business
well
sir
he
began
briskly
now
that
we
settled
that
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
to
it
why
shave
it
of
course
i
replied
bitterly
that
what
here
for
is
it
all
us
show
girls
have
got
to
have
our
chests
shaved
an
after
i
shaved
your
chest
dear
he
asked
in
a
soothing
voice
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
with
it
with
what
i
replied
enraged
with
my
chest
no
he
answered
easily
not
your
chest
but
that
one
poor
little
pitiful
hair
that
adorns
it
do
you
want
me
to
send
it
home
to
your
ma
all
tied
around
with
a
pink
ribbon
i
saw
no
reason
to
reply
to
this
insult
but
stood
uneasily
and
tried
to
maintain
my
dignity
while
he
lathered
me
with
undue
elaboration
when
it
was
time
for
him
to
produce
his
razor
he
faltered
i
ca
do
it
he
said
brokenly
i
have
the
heart
to
cut
it
down
in
its
prime
it
looks
so
lonely
and
helpless
there
by
itself
he
swept
his
razor
around
several
times
with
a
swoop
of
his
arm
well
here
goes
he
said
shutting
his
eyes
and
approaching
me
tony
turned
away
as
if
unable
to
witness
the
scene
i
was
unnerved
but
i
stood
my
ground
the
deed
was
done
and
i
was
at
last
free
to
depart
that
a
terrible
chest
for
a
show
girl
i
heard
him
to
say
to
tony
as
i
did
so
the
world
has
come
clattering
down
around
my
ears
and
i
am
buried
crushed
and
bruised
beneath
the
debris
there
was
a
dress
rehearsal
and
i
from
the
whole
company
was
singled
out
for
the
wrath
of
the
gods
who
is
that
chorus
girl
on
the
end
acting
frantic
cried
out
one
of
the
directors
in
the
middle
of
a
number
my
name
was
shouted
across
the
stage
until
it
echoed
and
resounded
and
came
bounding
back
in
my
face
from
every
corner
of
the
theater
i
knew
i
was
in
for
it
and
drew
myself
up
majestically
although
i
turned
pale
under
my
war
paint
well
tell
him
he
is
walking
on
stilts
continued
the
director
and
although
it
was
perfectly
unnecessary
i
was
told
that
and
several
other
things
with
brutal
candor
the
dance
went
on
but
i
knew
the
eyes
of
the
director
were
on
me
my
legs
seemed
to
lose
all
proper
coordination
my
arms
became
unmanageable
i
lost
step
and
could
not
pick
it
up
again
yet
as
in
a
nightmare
i
struggled
on
desperately
suddenly
the
director
clapped
his
hands
the
music
ceased
and
i
slowed
down
to
an
uneasy
shuffle
sweetheart
said
the
director
addressing
me
personally
you
not
dancing
you
swimming
that
what
you
doing
as
a
persian
girl
you
would
make
a
first
class
squaw
he
halted
for
a
moment
and
then
bawled
out
in
a
great
voice
understudy
and
i
was
removed
from
the
stage
in
a
fainting
condition
this
evening
i
was
shipped
back
to
camp
a
thoroughly
discredited
show
girl
i
had
labored
long
in
vicious
corsets
and
like
samson
been
shorn
of
my
locks
and
here
i
am
after
all
my
sacrifices
relegated
back
to
the
scrap
heap
why
am
i
always
the
unfortunate
one
i
must
have
a
private
plot
in
the
sky
strewn
with
unlucky
stars
camp
routine
after
the
free
life
of
the
stage
is
unbearably
irksome
my
particular
jimmy
legs
was
so
glad
to
see
me
back
that
he
almost
cried
as
he
thrust
a
broom
and
a
swab
into
my
hands
bear
a
hand
he
said
gleefully
get
to
work
and
stick
to
it
short
of
men
he
added
and
there
is
no
end
of
things
for
you
to
do
i
did
them
all
and
he
was
right
there
surely
is
no
end
to
the
things
he
can
devise
for
me
to
do
i
long
for
the
glamour
and
footlights
of
the
gay
white
way
but
i
have
been
cast
out
and
rejected
as
many
a
show
girl
has
been
before
me
the
morning
papers
say
all
sort
of
nice
things
about
but
i
can
hardly
believe
them
sincere
after
the
treatment
i
received
i
know
for
a
fact
that
the
man
who
took
my
place
was
and
that
the
rest
of
his
figure
could
not
hold
a
candle
to
mine
i
still
feel
convinced
that
lost
one
of
its
most
prepossessing
and
talented
artists
when
i
was
so
unceremoniously
removed
from
the
chorus
i
was
standing
doing
harm
to
no
one
in
a
vague
rather
unfortunate
way
i
have
when
all
of
a
sudden
without
word
or
warning
a
very
competent
looking
sailor
seized
me
by
the
shoulders
and
thrusting
his
face
close
to
mine
cried
out
do
you
want
to
make
a
name
for
yourself
in
the
service
i
left
the
ground
two
feet
below
me
in
my
fright
and
when
i
alighted
there
were
tears
of
eagerness
in
my
eyes
yes
i
replied
breathlessly
oh
sir
yes
then
pick
up
that
he
cried
dramatically
pointing
to
a
cigar
butt
on
the
parade
ground
i
did
wait
for
the
laughter
i
did
have
to
it
was
forthcoming
immediately
huge
peals
of
it
sailors
are
a
very
low
tribe
of
vertebrate
they
seem
to
hang
around
most
of
the
time
waiting
for
something
to
laugh
at
usually
me
it
is
my
belief
that
i
have
been
the
subject
of
more
mirth
since
i
came
to
camp
than
any
other
man
on
the
station
whatever
i
do
i
seem
to
do
it
too
much
or
too
little
there
even
seems
to
be
something
in
my
personal
appearance
which
i
have
always
regarded
hitherto
not
without
a
certain
shade
of
satisfaction
only
the
other
day
i
caught
the
eyes
of
the
gloomiest
sailor
in
camp
studying
me
with
a
puzzled
expression
he
gazed
at
me
for
such
a
long
time
that
i
became
quite
disconcerted
slowly
a
smile
spread
over
his
face
then
a
strange
rusty
laugh
forced
itself
through
his
lips
doggone
if
i
can
solve
it
he
chuckled
turning
away
and
shaking
his
head
it
just
simply
too
much
for
me
he
looked
back
once
clapped
his
hands
over
his
mouth
and
proceeded
merrily
on
his
way
i
am
glad
of
course
to
be
able
to
bring
joy
into
the
lives
of
sailors
but
i
did
not
enlist
for
that
sole
purpose
returning
to
the
cigar
butt
however
i
was
really
quite
disappointed
i
do
so
want
to
make
a
name
for
myself
in
the
service
that
i
would
eagerly
jump
at
the
chance
of
sailing
up
the
kiel
canal
in
a
barnegat
sneak
box
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
sailing
always
makes
me
deathly
sick
i
do
know
why
it
is
but
the
more
i
have
to
do
with
water
the
more
reasons
i
find
for
shunning
it
the
cigar
butt
episode
broke
my
heart
though
i
was
all
keyed
up
for
some
heroic
deed
what
an
i
left
the
spot
in
a
bitter
humiliated
mood
there
is
only
one
comforting
part
about
the
whole
affair
i
did
not
pick
up
that
cigar
butt
he
did
i
bet
though
when
nobody
was
looking
i
do
know
as
i
blame
him
there
were
still
several
healthy
drags
left
in
it
this
war
is
going
to
put
a
lot
of
chinamen
out
of
business
if
it
keeps
up
much
longer
the
first
thing
a
sailor
will
do
after
he
has
been
paid
off
will
be
to
establish
a
laundry
and
he
wo
be
a
slouch
at
the
business
at
that
i
feel
sure
that
i
am
qualified
right
now
to
take
in
family
laundry
and
before
the
end
of
summer
i
guess
i
be
able
to
do
fancy
work
at
present
i
am
what
you
might
call
a
first
class
laundryman
but
i
not
a
fancy
laundryman
yet
since
they
put
us
in
whites
i
go
around
with
the
complaint
most
of
the
time
terrible
shooting
pains
in
my
back
my
sympathy
for
the
downtrodden
is
increasing
by
leaps
and
bounds
i
can
picture
myself
without
any
effort
of
the
imagination
bending
over
a
tub
after
the
war
doing
the
family
washing
while
my
wife
is
out
running
for
alderman
or
pulling
the
wires
to
be
appointed
commissioner
of
the
docks
the
white
clothes
situation
however
is
serious
it
seems
that
every
spare
moment
i
have
i
am
either
washing
or
thinking
of
washing
or
just
after
having
washed
and
to
one
who
possesses
as
i
do
the
uncanny
faculty
of
being
able
to
get
dirtier
in
more
places
in
the
shortest
space
of
time
than
any
ten
street
children
picked
at
random
could
ever
equal

this
war
is
going
to
put
a
lot
of
chinamen
out
of
business
you
boys
look
so
cute
in
your
funny
white
uniforms
a
girl
said
to
me
the
other
day
it
must
be
so
jolly
wearing
them
i
did
strike
her
for
she
was
easily
ten
pounds
heavier
than
i
was
but
i
made
it
easily
apparent
that
our
relations
would
never
progress
further
than
the
weather
vane
i
used
to
affect
white
pajamas
the
same
seeming
to
harmonize
with
the
natural
purity
of
my
nature
but
after
the
war
i
fear
i
shall
be
forced
to
discontinue
the
practise
in
favor
of
more
lurid
attire
however
i
still
believe
that
a
bachelor
should
never
wear
anything
other
than
white
pajamas
or
at
the
most
lavender
but
this
of
course
is
merely
a
personal
opinion
i
have
been
hard
put
the
lord
only
knows
what
trials
and
tribulations
will
be
visited
upon
me
next
at
present
i
am
quite
unnerved
i
was
initiated
into
all
the
horrifying
secrets
and
possibilities
of
the
bayonet
european
style
never
do
i
remember
spending
a
more
unpleasant
half
an
hour
the
instructor
was
a
resourceful
man
possessed
of
a
most
vivid
imagination
before
he
had
finished
with
us
potential
delicatessen
dealers
were
lying
around
as
thick
as
flies
we
were
brushing
them
off
after
several
exhibitions
he
formed
us
into
two
lines
facing
each
other
and
told
us
to
begin
now
lunge
he
said
and
look
as
if
you
meant
business
i
glanced
ingratiatingly
across
at
my
adversary
he
was
simply
glaring
at
me
never
have
i
seen
an
expression
of
greater
ferocity
it
was
too
much
i
knew
for
certain
that
if
he
ever
lunged
at
me
i
never
live
to
draw
another
yellow
slip
mister
officer
i
gasped
pointing
across
at
this
man
do
you
think
that
he
just
a
little
too
close
i
afraid
i
might
hurt
him
by
accident
the
officer
surveyed
the
situation
with
a
swift
practical
eye
oh
i
guess
he
can
take
care
of
himself
all
right
he
replied
that
was
just
what
i
feared
the
man
smiled
grimly
but
does
he
know
that
this
is
only
practise
i
continued
he
certainly
does
look
as
if
he
did
that
the
way
you
should
look
said
the
officer
work
your
own
face
up
a
bit
this
is
a
vampire
scene
do
look
as
if
you
were
going
to
lure
him
you
supposed
to
be
angry
with
your
opponent
when
you
meet
him
in
battle
quite
put
out
in
fact
and
furthermore
you
supposed
to
look
it
i
regarded
my
opponent
but
only
terror
was
written
on
my
face
then
suddenly
we
lunged
and
either
through
fear
or
mismanagement
i
succeeded
only
in
running
my
bayonet
deep
into
the
ground
in
some
strange
manner
the
butt
of
the
gun
jabbed
me
in
the
stomach
and
i
was
completely
winded
my
opponent
was
dancing
and
darting
around
me
like
a
local
but
lightning
storm
i
abandoned
my
gun
and
stood
sideways
thus
decreasing
the
possible
area
of
danger
had
the
exercises
continued
much
longer
i
would
have
had
a
spell
of
something
probably
the
blind
staggers
illustration
i
stood
thus
decreasing
the
possible
area
of
danger
you
not
pole
vaulting
said
the
instructor
to
me
as
he
returned
the
gun
in
a
real
show
you
have
looked
like
a
pin
cushion
by
this
time
i
felt
like
one
then
it
all
started
over
again
and
this
time
i
thought
i
was
doing
a
little
better
when
quite
unexpectedly
the
instructor
shouted
at
me
stop
prancing
around
in
that
silly
manner
he
cried
you
not
doing
a
sword
dance
sonny
he
thinks
he
still
a
show
girl
some
one
chuckled
he
that
seductive
mess
gear
interrupted
our
happy
morning
the
sight
of
a
knife
fairly
sickened
me
last
week
i
caught
a
liberty
a
perfect
and
went
to
spend
it
with
some
cliff
dwelling
friends
of
mine
who
heaven
help
their
wretched
lot
lived
on
the
sixth
and
top
floor
of
one
of
those
famous
new
york
before
shoving
off
there
was
some
slight
misunderstanding
between
the
inspecting
officer
and
myself
relative
to
the
exact
color
of
my
broadly
speaking
whites
fall
out
there
he
said
to
me
you
ca
go
out
on
liberty
in
blues
but
these
sir
i
responded
huskily
are
not
blues
whites
look
like
blues
to
me
he
said
skeptically
fall
out
anyway
too
dirty
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
said
nothing
at
the
right
time
i
just
looked
at
him
there
was
a
dumb
misery
in
my
eyes
a
mute
humble
appeal
such
as
is
practised
with
so
much
success
by
dogs
he
resist
it
probably
he
was
thinking
of
the
days
when
he
too
stood
in
line
waiting
impatiently
for
the
final
formalities
to
be
run
through
before
the
world
was
his
again
turn
around
he
said
brokenly
i
did
so
fall
in
he
ordered
after
having
made
a
prolonged
inspection
of
my
shrinking
back
i
guess
you
do
but
you
are
only
getting
through
on
a
technicality
there
one
white
spot
under
your
collar
officers
are
people
after
all
although
sometimes
it
hard
to
realize
it
this
one
in
imagination
i
anointed
with
oil
and
rare
perfumes
and
costly
gifts
i
laid
at
his
feet
while
in
a
glad
voice
i
called
down
the
blessings
of
john
paul
jones
upon
his
excellent
head
thus
i
departed
with
my
kind
and
never
did
the
odor
of
gasoline
smell
sweeter
in
my
nose
than
did
the
fumes
that
were
being
emitted
by
the
impatient
flivver
that
waited
without
the
gate
and
sweet
too
was
the
fetid
atmosphere
of
the
subway
after
the
clean
bracing
air
of
pelham
sweet
was
the
smell
of
garlic
belonging
to
a
mustache
that
sat
beside
me
and
sweet
were
the
buttery
fingers
of
a
small
child
who
kept
clawing
at
me
while
their
owner
demanded
of
the
whole
car
if
i
was
a
weal
mavy
sailor
boy
i
did
look
it
and
i
did
feel
it
but
i
had
hours
of
freedom
ahead
of
me
so
what
did
i
care
all
went
well
with
me
until
i
essayed
the
six
flight
to
the
cave
of
these
people
when
i
found
that
the
existence
i
had
been
leading
in
the
pelham
bungalows
had
completely
unfitted
me
for
mountain
climbing
as
i
toiled
upward
i
wondered
dimly
how
these
people
ever
managed
to
keep
so
fat
after
having
mounted
to
such
a
great
distance
for
so
long
a
time
somehow
they
had
done
it
not
only
maintained
their
already
acquired
fat
but
added
greatly
thereto
there
would
be
no
refreshing
cup
to
quaff
upon
arriving
only
water
or
at
best
milk
this
i
knew
and
the
knowledge
added
pounds
to
my
already
heavy
feet
my
what
a
dirty
sailor
you
are
to
be
sure
they
said
to
me
from
the
depth
of
their
plump
complacency
quite
so
i
gasped
falling
into
a
chair
i
seem
to
remember
having
heard
the
same
thing
once
before
neither
saturday
nor
sunday
was
a
complete
success
and
for
a
while
saturday
afternoon
assumed
the
proportions
of
a
disaster
after
having
rested
from
my
climb
i
decided
to
wash
my
whites
so
that
i
would
be
arrested
as
a
deserter
or
be
thrown
into
the
brig
upon
checking
in
the
fat
people
on
learning
of
my
intentions
decided
that
the
sight
of
such
labor
would
tire
them
beyond
endurance
so
they
departed
leaving
me
in
solitary
possession
of
their
flat
i
thereupon
removed
my
jumper
humped
my
back
over
the
tub
scrubbed
industriously
until
the
garment
was
white
then
hastened
roofwards
and
arranged
it
prettily
on
the
line
this
accomplished
i
hurried
down
removed
my
trousers
rehumped
my
back
over
the
tub
scrubbed
industriously
until
the
trousers
in
turn
were
white
and
once
more
dashed
roofwards
i
have
always
been
absent
minded
but
never
to
such
an
appalling
extent
as
to
appear
clad
only
in
my
scanty
underwear
in
the
midst
of
a
mixed
throng
of
ladies
gentlemen
and
children
this
i
did
some
venturous
souls
had
claimed
the
roof
as
their
own
during
my
absence
so
that
when
i
sprang
from
the
final
step
to
claim
my
place
in
the
sun
i
found
myself
by
no
means
alone
with
a
cry
of
horror
i
leaped
to
the
other
side
of
the
and
endeavored
to
conceal
myself
behind
an
old
petticoat
or
a
lady
old
petticoat
or
something
of
that
nature
whoever
wore
the
thing
must
have
been
a
very
short
person
indeed
for
the
garment
reached
scarcely
down
to
my
knees
below
which
my
fluttered
in
an
intriguing
manner
sir
thundered
a
pompous
gentleman
have
you
any
explanation
for
your
surprising
conduct
several
i
replied
briskly
from
behind
my
only
claim
on
respectability
in
the
first
place
i
did
expect
an
audience
in
the
second
that
will
do
sir
broke
in
this
heavy
person
in
a
quarterdeck
voice
who
may
i
ask
are
you
you
may
i
replied
i
a
sailor
man
who
is
doing
the
best
he
can
to
keep
nice
and
clean
in
spite
of
the
uncalled
for
intervention
of
a
oaf
of
a
plumber
person
who
should
know
better
than
to
stand
around
watching
him
illustration
i
a
sailor
man
who
is
doing
the
best
he
can
to
keep
clean
do
take
on
so
george
said
one
of
the
women
whom
i
suspected
of
edging
around
in
order
to
get
a
better
view
of
me
the
poor
young
man
is
a
sailor
where
is
your
patriotism
yes
broke
in
the
other
woman
edging
around
on
the
other
side
he
one
of
our
sailor
boys
treat
him
nice
patriotic
i
am
roared
george
wrathfully
but
not
to
the
extent
of
condoning
and
looking
lightly
upon
such
a
flagrant
breach
of
decency
as
this
sailor
has
committed
in
our
midst
if
you
give
me
a
couple
of
thrift
stamps
i
suggested
i
might
be
able
to
come
out
from
behind
this
blooming
barrage
shameless
exploded
the
man
not
at
all
i
replied
in
the
olden
days
it
was
quite
customary
for
young
gentlemen
and
elderly
stout
ones
like
yourself
for
instance
to
drop
in
at
the
best
caves
with
very
much
less
on
than
i
have
without
any
one
considering
their
conduct
in
any
degree
irregular
in
fact
the
ladies
of
this
time
were
no
better
themselves
it
being
deemed
highly
proper
for
them
to
appear
in
some
small
bit
of
stuff
and
nobody
thought
the
worst
of
it
at
all
take
the
early
days
of
the
fifteenth
century
at
this
point
in
my
eloquent
address
a
young
child
who
had
hitherto
escaped
my
attention
took
it
upon
herself
to
swing
on
the
line
with
the
result
that
it
parted
with
a
snap
and
my
last
vestige
of
protection
came
fluttering
to
the
roof
for
one
tense
moment
i
stood
gazing
into
the
dilated
eyes
of
those
before
me
then
with
surprising
presence
of
mind
i
sprang
to
a
ladder
that
led
to
the
water
tank
swarmed
up
it
with
the
agility
of
a
cat
and
lowered
myself
with
a
gasp
of
despair
into
the
cold
cold
water
of
the
tank
from
this
place
of
security
i
gazed
down
on
the
man
who
had
been
responsible
for
my
unfortunate
plight
i
felt
myself
sinned
against
and
the
longer
i
remained
in
that
water
up
to
my
neck
the
more
i
felt
my
wrongs
i
gave
voice
to
them
i
said
bitter
abusive
things
to
the
man
clear
the
quarter
deck
i
shouted
get
aft
or
by
gad
i
come
fluttering
down
there
on
your
flat
bald
head
like
a
blooming
flood
vamoos
hombre
pronto
plenty
quick
and
take
your
brood
with
you
then
i
said
some
more
things
as
my
father
before
me
had
said
them
and
the
man
withdrew
with
his
women
he
a
sailor
he
said
as
he
did
so
hurry
my
dears
this
is
worse
than
nakedness
i
emerged
and
sat
in
a
borrowed
bathrobe
the
rest
of
the
evening
the
next
morning
my
clothes
were
still
damp
now
that
what
i
call
a
stupid
way
to
spend
a
saturday
night
on
liberty
the
fat
people
enjoyed
it
i
met
a
very
pleasant
dog
yesterday
whom
i
called
fogerty
because
of
his
sober
countenance
and
the
benign
but
rather
puzzled
expression
in
his
large
limpid
eyes
which
were
almost
completely
hidden
by
his
bangs
he
was
evidently
a
visitor
in
camp
so
i
took
him
around
and
introduced
him
to
the
rest
of
the
dogs
and
several
of
the
better
sort
of
goats
in
all
of
these
he
displayed
a
friendly
but
dignified
interest
seeming
to
question
them
on
the
life
of
the
camp
how
they
liked
the
navy
and
what
they
thought
were
the
prospects
for
an
early
peace
he
refused
to
be
separated
from
me
however
and
even
broke
into
the
mess
hall
from
which
he
was
unceremoniously
ejected
but
not
before
he
had
gotten
half
of
my
ration
in
some
strange
manner
he
must
have
found
out
from
one
of
the
other
dogs
my
name
and
address
and
exactly
where
i
swung
for
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
awoke
to
hear
a
lonesome
whining
in
the
darkness
beneath
my
hammock
and
then
the
sniff
sniff
of
an
investigating
nose
as
i
know
how
it
feels
to
be
lonely
in
a
big
black
barracks
in
the
dead
of
night
i
carefully
descended
to
the
deck
and
collected
this
animal
it
was
my
old
friend
fogerty
and
he
was
quite
overjoyed
at
having
once
more
found
me
after
licking
my
face
in
gratitude
he
sat
back
on
his
haunches
and
waited
for
me
to
do
something
amusing
i
did
have
the
heart
to
leave
him
there
in
the
darkness
dogs
have
a
certain
way
about
them
that
gets
me
every
time
i
lifted
fogerty
a
huge
hulk
of
a
dog
with
much
care
and
adjusting
of
overlapping
paws
into
my
hammock
and
received
a
kiss
in
the
eye
for
my
trouble
then
i
followed
fogerty
into
the
hammock
and
resumed
my
slumber
but
not
with
much
comfort
fogerty
is
a
large
sprawly
dog
who
evidently
has
been
used
to
sleeping
in
vast
spaces
and
who
sees
no
reason
for
changing
a
lifelong
habit
consequently
he
considered
me
in
the
nature
of
a
piece
of
gratifying
upholstery
he
slept
with
his
hind
legs
on
my
stomach
and
his
front
paws
propped
against
my
chin
when
he
scratched
as
he
not
infrequently
did
what
i
decided
must
be
a
flea
his
hind
leg
beat
upon
the
canvas
and
produced
a
noise
not
unlike
a
drum
thus
we
slept
but
through
some
miscalculation
i
must
have
slept
over
for
it
seems
that
the
a
very
large
and
capable
irishman
came
and
shook
my
hammock
illustration
i
took
him
around
and
introduced
him
to
the
rest
of
the
dogs
and
several
of
the
better
sort
of
goats
hit
the
deck
there
sailor
he
said
shake
a
leg
shake
a
leg
at
this
point
fogerty
took
it
upon
himself
to
peer
over
the
side
of
the
hammock
to
see
who
this
disturber
of
peace
and
quiet
could
be
this
was
just
a
little
out
of
the
line
of
duty
for
the
jimmy
legs
and
i
ca
say
as
i
blame
him
for
his
conduct
under
rather
trying
circumstances
fogerty
has
a
large
shaggy
head
not
unlike
a
lion
and
his
mouth
too
is
quite
large
and
contains
some
very
long
and
sharp
teeth
it
seems
that
fogerty
still
heavy
with
slumber
quite
naturally
yawned
into
the
horrified
face
of
the
who
mistaking
the
operation
for
a
hostile
demonstration
retreated
from
the
barracks
with
admirable
rapidity
for
one
so
large
crying
in
a
distracted
voice
as
he
did
so
by
the
saints
it
a
beast
he
turned
into
during
the
night
sure
it
a
visitation
of
providence
heaven
preserve
us
it
seems
i
have
been
washing
hammocks
ever
since
fogerty
sits
around
and
wonders
what
it
all
about
i
like
fogerty
but
he
gets
me
in
trouble
and
in
this
i
need
no
help
whatsoever
illustration
i
resumed
my
slumber
but
not
with
much
comfort
this
day
i
almost
succeeded
in
sinking
myself
for
the
final
count
the
fishes
around
about
the
environs
of
city
island
were
disappointed
beyond
words
when
i
came
up
for
the
fourth
time
and
stayed
up
in
my
delirium
i
imagined
that
school
had
been
let
out
in
honor
of
my
reception
and
that
all
the
pretty
little
fishes
were
sticking
around
in
expectant
groups
cheering
loudly
at
the
thought
of
the
conclusion
of
their
meatless
days
fortunately
for
the
navy
however
i
cheated
them
and
saved
myself
in
order
to
scrub
many
more
hammocks
and
white
clothes
an
object
to
which
i
seem
to
have
dedicated
my
life
it
all
come
about
as
do
most
drowning
parties
in
quite
an
unexpected
manner
for
some
reason
it
had
been
arranged
that
i
should
take
a
swim
over
at
one
of
the
emporiums
at
city
island
and
as
i
interposed
no
objections
i
accordingly
departed
with
my
faithful
fogerty
tumbling
along
at
my
heels
since
fogerty
involved
me
in
trouble
the
other
day
by
barking
at
the
he
has
endeavored
in
all
possible
ways
to
make
up
for
his
thoughtless
irregularity
for
instance
he
met
me
this
morning
with
an
almost
brand
new
shoe
which
in
some
manner
he
had
managed
to
pick
up
in
his
wanderings
it
fits
perfectly
and
if
he
only
succeeds
in
finding
the
mate
to
it
i
shall
probably
not
look
for
the
owner
as
a
further
proof
of
his
good
will
fogerty
bit
or
attempted
to
bite
a
who
spoke
to
me
roughly
regarding
the
picturesque
way
i
was
holding
my
gun
whose
dog
is
that
demanded
the
silence
in
the
ranks
fogerty
looked
defiantly
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
trotted
deliberately
over
and
sat
down
upon
my
foot
oh
so
he
belongs
to
you
continued
the
in
a
threatening
voice
no
sir
i
faltered
you
see
it
is
that
way
at
all
i
belong
to
mr
fogerty
who
in
who
in
who
is
mr
fogerty
shouted
the
and
how
in
how
in
how
did
happen
to
get
into
the
conversation
why
this
is
fogerty
i
replied
this
dog
here
sitting
on
my
foot
oh
is
that
so
jeered
the
a
man
noted
for
his
quick
retorts
well
you
take
your
silly
looking
dog
away
from
here
and
secure
him
in
some
safe
place
he
ai
no
fit
associate
for
our
camp
dogs
and
furthermore
he
added
the
next
time
fogerty
attempts
to
bite
me
i
going
to
put
you
on
report
savez
fogerty
is
almost
as
much
of
a
comfort
in
camp
as
mother
well
that
another
something
else
again
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
swim
and
approximate
drowning
at
city
island
swimming
has
always
been
one
of
my
strong
points
and
i
have
taken
in
the
past
no
little
pride
in
my
appearance
not
only
in
a
bathing
outfit
but
also
in
the
water
however
the
suit
they
provided
me
with
on
this
occasion
did
not
show
me
up
in
a
very
alluring
light
it
was
quite
large
and
evidently
built
according
to
a
model
of
the
early
victorian
era
i
was
swathed
in
yards
of
cloth
much
in
the
same
manner
as
is
a
very
young
child
it
delighted
fogerty
who
expressed
his
admiration
by
attaching
himself
to
the
lower
half
of
my
attire
and
remaining
there
until
i
had
waded
through
several
colonies
of
barnacles
far
out
into
the
bay
bidding
farewell
to
fogerty
at
this
point
i
gave
myself
over
to
the
joy
of
the
moment
and
went
wallowing
along
giving
a
surprising
imitation
of
the
famous
australian
crawl
far
in
the
distance
i
sighted
an
island
to
which
i
decided
to
swim
this
was
a
very
poor
decision
indeed
because
long
before
i
had
reached
the
spot
i
was
in
a
sinking
condition
owing
to
the
great
heaviness
of
my
suit
and
a
tremendous
slacking
down
of
lung
power
it
was
too
late
to
retreat
to
the
shore
the
island
was
the
nearest
point
and
that
was
near
on
i
gasped
my
mind
teeming
with
cheerless
thoughts
of
the
ocean
bed
waiting
to
receive
me
just
as
i
was
about
to
shake
hands
with
myself
for
the
last
time
i
cleared
the
water
from
my
eyes
and
discovered
that
the
island
though
still
distant
was
not
altogether
impossible
therewith
i
discarded
the
top
part
of
my
suit
and
struck
out
once
more
the
island
was
now
almost
within
my
grasp
life
seemed
to
be
not
such
a
lost
cause
after
all
then
suddenly
quite
clearly
just
as
i
was
about
to
pull
myself
up
on
the
shore
i
saw
a
woman
standing
on
the
bank
and
heard
her
shouting
in
a
very
conventional
voice
private
property
private
property
i
sank
this
was
too
much
as
i
came
up
for
the
first
count
and
just
before
i
sank
back
beneath
the
blue
i
had
time
to
hear
her
repeat
private
property
please
keep
off
i
went
down
very
quickly
this
time
and
very
far
when
i
arose
i
saw
as
though
in
a
dream
another
woman
standing
by
the
first
one
and
seemingly
arguing
with
her
he
drowning
she
said
i
sure
i
ca
help
that
the
other
one
answered
and
then
in
a
loud
imperious
voice
private
property
no
visitors
allowed
the
water
closed
over
my
head
and
stilled
her
hateful
voice
no
she
was
saying
as
i
came
up
for
the
third
time
i
ca
do
it
if
i
make
an
exception
of
one
i
must
make
an
exception
of
all
although
i
hated
to
be
rude
about
it
having
always
disliked
forcing
myself
upon
people
i
decided
on
my
fourth
trip
down
that
unless
i
wanted
to
be
a
dead
sailor
i
had
better
be
taking
steps
it
was
almost
too
late
there
was
enough
wind
left
in
me
to
fatten
a
small
sized
bubble
there
he
is
again
she
cried
in
a
petulant
voice
as
i
once
more
appeared
why
does
he
go
away
he
just
about
to
for
good
said
the
other
lady
with
a
pitiful
yap
i
struck
out
feebly
in
the
general
direction
of
the
shore
it
would
work
my
arms
refused
to
move
then
quite
suddenly
and
deliriously
i
felt
two
soft
cool
arms
enfold
me
and
my
head
sank
back
on
a
delicately
unholstered
shoulder
somehow
it
reminded
me
of
the
old
days
home
james
i
murmured
as
i
was
slowly
towed
to
shore
just
before
closing
my
eyes
i
caught
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
a
young
lady
clad
in
one
of
the
bathing
suits
i
had
ever
seen
she
was
bending
over
me
sympathetically
private
property
cried
my
tormentor
shaking
a
finger
at
me
what
a
pity
i
thought
as
i
closed
my
eyes
and
drifted
off
into
sweet
dreams
in
which
fogerty
my
beautiful
rescuer
and
myself
were
dancing
on
the
parade
ground
to
the
music
of
the
massed
band
much
to
the
edification
of
the
entire
station
assembled
in
review
formation
presently
i
awoke
to
the
hateful
strains
of
this
old
voice
see
what
you
done
she
was
saying
to
the
young
girl
brought
in
a
half
naked
man
and
now
that
he
has
seen
you
in
a
much
worse
condition
than
he
is
we
have
ten
thousand
sailors
swimming
out
to
this
island
in
one
continuous
swarm
oh
wo
that
be
fun
cried
the
girl
and
from
that
time
on
in
spite
of
the
objections
of
her
mother
we
were
fast
friends
when
i
returned
to
shore
it
was
in
a
rowboat
with
this
fair
young
creature
the
faithful
fogerty
was
waiting
on
the
beach
for
me
where
it
later
developed
he
had
been
sleeping
quite
comfortably
on
an
unknown
woman
high
powered
sport
hat
as
is
only
reasonable
mother
got
in
again
there
seems
to
be
no
practical
way
of
keeping
her
out
this
time
she
came
breezing
in
with
a
friend
from
east
aurora
a
large
elderly
woman
of
about
one
hundred
and
ten
summers
and
an
equal
number
of
very
hard
winters
the
first
thing
mother
said
was
to
the
effect
that
she
was
going
to
see
what
she
could
do
about
getting
me
a
rating
she
did
the
very
first
officer
she
saw
she
sailed
up
to
and
buttonholed
much
to
my
horror
why
ca
my
boy
oswald
have
a
pretty
little
eagle
on
his
arm
such
as
i
see
so
many
of
the
young
men
up
here
wearing
about
the
camp
the
abruptness
of
this
question
left
the
officer
momentarily
stunned
but
i
will
say
for
him
that
he
rallied
quickly
and
returned
a
remarkably
diplomatic
reply
to
the
effect
that
the
pretty
little
eagle
although
pleasing
to
gaze
upon
was
not
primarily
intended
to
be
so
much
of
a
decoration
as
means
of
identification
and
that
certain
small
qualifications
were
required
as
a
rule
before
one
was
permitted
to
wear
one
of
the
emblems
in
question
qualifications
he
hastened
to
add
which
he
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
i
failed
to
possess
if
i
was
the
true
son
of
my
mother
but
which
owing
to
fate
and
circumstances
i
had
probably
been
unable
to
exercise
whereupon
he
bid
her
a
very
courteous
returned
my
salute
and
passed
on
but
not
before
the
very
old
lady
accompanying
my
mother
saluted
also
raising
her
hand
to
her
funny
bit
of
a
bonnet
with
unnecessary
snappiness
and
snickering
in
a
senile
manner
this
last
episode
upset
me
completely
but
the
old
lady
was
irrepressible
from
that
time
on
she
punctuated
her
progress
through
the
camp
with
exaggerated
salutes
to
all
the
officers
she
encountered
on
the
way
this
of
course
was
quite
a
startling
and
undignified
performance
for
one
of
her
years
very
embarrassing
to
me
as
well
as
mystifying
to
the
officers
who
hardly
knew
whether
to
hurl
me
into
the
brig
as
vicarious
atonement
or
to
rebuke
the
flighty
old
creature
on
the
grounds
of
undue
levity
most
of
them
passed
by
however
with
averted
eyes
and
a
discountenanced
expression
feeling
i
am
sure
that
i
had
put
her
up
to
it
mother
thought
it
quite
amusing
and
enjoyed
my
discomfiture
hugely
then
for
no
particular
reason
she
began
to
garnish
her
conversation
with
inappropriate
seagoing
expressions
such
as
pipe
down
hit
the
deck
avast
and
hello
buddy
where
she
ever
picked
up
all
this
nonsense
i
am
at
a
loss
to
discover
but
she
continued
to
pull
it
to
the
bitter
end
hello
buddy
was
the
way
she
greeted
the
of
my
barracks
after
i
had
introduced
her
to
him
with
much
elaboration
this
completely
floored
the
poor
lad
and
rendered
him
inarticulate
he
thinks
now
that
i
come
from
either
a
family
of
thugs
or
maniacs
probably
the
latter
i
succeeded
in
shaking
the
old
thing
for
a
while
and
when
i
next
found
her
she
was
demonstrating
the
proper
method
of
washing
whites
to
a
group
of
sailors
assembled
in
the
wash
room
of
one
of
our
most
popular
latrines
she
was
heading
in
the
direction
of
the
shower
baths
when
i
finally
rounded
her
up
she
was
a
game
old
lady
i
have
to
hand
her
that
her
wildest
escapade
was
reserved
for
the
end
of
her
visit
when
i
took
her
over
to
the
of
hut
and
she
challenged
any
sailor
present
to
a
game
of
pool
for
a
quarter
a
ball
when
we
told
her
that
the
sailors
in
the
navy
never
gambled
she
said
that
she
was
completely
off
the
service
and
that
she
thought
it
was
high
time
that
we
learned
to
do
something
useful
instead
of
singing
sentimental
songs
and
weaving
ourselves
into
intricate
figures
this
remark
forced
us
to
it
and
much
against
our
wills
we
proceeded
to
show
the
old
lady
up
at
pool
she
had
been
bluffing
all
along
and
when
it
came
to
a
showdown
we
found
that
she
could
shoot
for
shucks
when
the
news
spread
around
the
hut
the
sailors
crowded
about
her
thick
as
thieves
challenging
her
to
play
she
was
a
wild
unregenerated
old
lady
but
she
was
by
no
means
an
easy
mark
as
it
later
developed
when
she
matched
them
for
the
winnings
got
it
all
back
and
i
am
told
by
some
sailors
that
she
even
left
the
hut
a
little
ahead
of
the
game
i
do
object
to
notoriety
but
there
are
numerous
ways
of
winning
it
that
are
objectionable
and
this
old
lady
was
one
mother
must
have
been
giddier
in
her
youth
than
i
ever
imagined
yesterday
i
lost
my
dog
fogerty
and
did
find
him
until
late
in
the
afternoon
he
was
up
in
front
of
the
first
regiment
mustered
in
with
the
liberty
party
when
he
discovered
my
presence
he
looked
coldly
at
me
as
if
he
had
never
seen
me
before
so
i
knew
that
he
had
a
date
he
just
sat
there
and
shook
his
bangs
over
his
eyes
and
tried
to
appear
as
if
he
were
somewhere
else
when
the
order
come
to
shove
off
he
joined
the
party
and
trotted
off
without
even
looking
back
and
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
him
until
this
morning
when
he
came
drifting
in
rather
unsteadily
and
regarded
me
with
a
shifty
but
insulting
eye
i
am
rapidly
discovering
hitherto
unsuspected
depths
of
depravity
in
fogerty
which
leads
me
to
believe
that
he
is
almost
human
this
has
been
the
doggonest
fourth
of
july
i
ever
spent
and
as
a
result
i
am
in
much
trouble
all
day
long
i
have
been
grooming
myself
to
look
spic
and
span
at
the
review
held
in
honor
of
the
secretary
when
he
opened
the
new
wing
to
the
camp
i
missed
it
i
lost
completely
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
ten
thousand
men
it
seems
hard
to
do
but
the
fact
the
ghastly
fact
remains
that
i
did
it
when
i
dashed
out
of
the
barracks
with
my
newly
washed
splendidly
seagoing
still
damp
white
hat
in
my
hand
my
company
was
gone
and
the
whole
camp
seemed
deserted
far
in
the
distance
i
heard
the
music
of
the
band
fogerty
looked
inquiringly
at
me
and
i
fled
he
fled
after
me
illustration
i
lost
completely
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
men
fogerty
i
gasped
this
is
a
trick
i
have
to
pull
off
alone
not
in
on
this
review
and
for
god
sake
act
reasonable
i
could
bear
the
thought
of
chasing
across
the
parade
ground
with
that
dog
bounding
along
at
my
heels
my
remark
had
no
effect
fogerty
merely
threw
himself
into
high
and
together
we
sped
in
the
direction
of
the
music
it
was
too
late
thousands
of
men
were
swinging
past
in
review
and
in
all
that
mass
of
humanity
there
was
one
small
vacant
place
that
i
was
supposed
to
fill
i
crouched
down
behind
a
tree
and
observed
the
scene
through
stricken
eyes
how
could
i
possibly
have
managed
to
lose
nearly
ten
thousand
men
it
seemed
incredible
and
i
realized
then
that
i
alone
could
have
accomplished
such
a
feat
and
i
had
been
so
nice
and
clean
too
and
i
had
worked
so
hard
to
be
all
of
those
things
i
bowed
my
head
in
misery
and
fogerty
god
bless
his
dissolute
soul
crept
up
to
me
and
tried
to
tell
me
it
was
all
right
and
did
matter
much
anyway
i
looked
down
and
discovered
that
my
snow
white
hat
was
all
muddy
fogerty
sat
on
it
as
a
result
of
my
being
scratched
out
of
the
independence
day
review
i
have
been
tried
out
as
punishment
in
all
sorts
of
disagreeable
positions
all
of
which
i
have
filled
with
an
inefficiency
only
equaled
by
the
bad
temper
of
my
some
of
these
tasks
one
in
particular
was
of
such
a
ridiculous
nature
that
i
refuse
to
enter
it
into
my
diary
for
an
unfeeling
posterity
to
jeer
at
i
am
willing
to
state
however
that
the
accomplishments
of
hercules
that
redoubtable
handy
man
of
mythology
were
trifling
in
comparison
with
mine
to
begin
with
the
coal
pile
is
altogether
too
large
and
my
back
is
altogether
too
refined
there
should
be
individual
coal
piles
provided
for
temperamental
sailors
small
colorful
appetizingly
shaped
mounds
of
nice
clean
glistening
chunks
of
coal
they
should
be
and
the
coal
itself
could
easily
be
made
much
lighter
approaching
if
possible
the
weight
of
feathers
this
would
be
a
task
any
reasonably
inclined
sailor
would
attack
with
relish
particularly
if
his
efforts
were
attended
by
the
strains
of
some
good
snappy
jazz
however
reality
wears
a
graver
face
and
a
sootier
one
long
did
i
labor
and
valiantly
but
to
little
effect
more
coal
fell
off
of
my
shovel
than
remained
on
it
this
was
due
to
the
unfortunate
fact
that
coal
dust
seems
to
affect
me
most
unpleasantly
much
in
the
same
manner
as
daisies
or
golden
rod
affect
hay
fever
sufferers
the
result
was
that
every
time
i
had
my
shovel
poised
in
readiness
to
hurl
its
burden
into
space
a
monolithic
sneeze
overpowered
me
shook
me
to
the
keel
and
all
the
coal
that
i
had
trapped
with
so
much
patience
and
cunning
fell
miserably
around
my
feet
from
whence
it
had
lately
risen
little
things
like
this
become
most
discouraging
when
strung
out
for
a
great
period
of
time
in
this
manner
i
sneezed
and
sweated
throughout
the
course
of
a
sweltering
afternoon
and
just
as
i
was
about
to
call
it
a
day
along
comes
an
evilly
inclined
coal
wagon
and
dumps
practically
in
my
lap
one
hundred
times
more
coal
than
i
had
disturbed
in
the
entire
course
of
my
labors
on
top
of
this
fogerty
who
had
been
loafing
around
all
day
with
his
tongue
out
disporting
himself
on
the
coal
pile
like
a
dog
in
the
first
snow
started
a
landslide
somewhere
above
and
came
bearing
down
on
me
in
a
cloud
of
dust
i
found
myself
buried
beneath
the
delighted
fogerty
and
a
couple
of
tons
of
coal
from
which
i
emerged
unbeamingly
but
not
before
fogerty
had
addressed
his
tongue
to
my
blackened
face
as
an
expression
of
high
good
humor
illustration
fogerty
came
bearing
down
on
me
in
a
cloud
of
dust
take
me
to
the
brig
i
said
walking
over
to
the
i
through
you
can
put
a
service
flag
on
that
coal
pile
for
me
what
consuming
you
buddy
asked
the
in
not
an
unkindly
voice
take
me
to
the
brig
i
repeated
it
too
much
here
i
been
working
diligently
all
day
to
reduce
the
size
of
this
huge
mass
when
up
comes
that
old
wagon
and
humps
its
back
and
belches
forth
its
horrid
contents
all
over
the
place
it
ridiculous
i
surrender
my
shovel
gord
breathed
the
looking
at
me
pityingly
we
do
want
to
go
and
reduce
that
coal
pile
we
want
to
enlarge
it
oh
i
replied
stunned
i
did
quite
understand
i
thought
you
wanted
to
make
it
smaller
so
i
been
trying
to
shovel
it
away
all
afternoon
you
should
oughter
have
done
that
replied
the
as
if
he
were
talking
to
an
idiot
i
suppose
you
been
shoveling
her
down
hill
all
day
i
admitted
that
i
had
you
see
i
added
engagingly
i
began
with
trying
to
shovel
her
up
hill
but
the
old
stuff
kept
on
rolling
down
on
me
so
i
drew
the
natural
conclusion
that
i
better
shovel
her
down
hill
it
seemed
more
reasonable
and
easier
suggested
the
yes
i
agreed
there
was
a
faraway
expression
in
his
eyes
when
he
next
spoke
recommend
you
for
an
ineptitude
discharge
he
said
if
it
was
for
the
fact
that
i
have
more
consideration
for
the
civilian
population
i
gladly
put
you
in
the
brig
for
life
if
i
could
feel
sure
you
would
injure
it
in
some
way
the
only
thing
left
for
me
to
do
is
to
make
you
promise
that
you
keep
away
from
our
coal
pile
and
swear
never
to
lay
violent
hands
on
it
again
you
spoil
it
i
gazed
up
at
the
monumental
mass
of
coal
rearing
itself
like
a
matterhorn
above
my
head
and
swore
fervently
never
to
molest
it
again
go
back
to
your
outfit
and
get
washed
and
tell
your
for
me
that
you
ca
come
here
no
more
and
he
added
as
i
was
about
to
depart
take
that
unusual
looking
bit
of
animal
life
with
you
it
all
wrong
police
his
body
or
he
ruin
some
of
your
pals
white
pants
and
they
would
like
that
at
all
i
feared
they
would
yes
sir
i
replied
in
a
crumpled
voice
much
obliged
sir
please
go
away
now
he
said
quietly
or
i
think
i
might
do
you
an
injury
he
was
fingering
the
shovel
nervously
as
he
spoke
thus
fogerty
and
i
departed
banished
even
from
our
dusky
helena
working
on
the
theory
of
opposites
i
was
next
placed
as
a
waiter
in
the
chief
petty
officer
mess
over
in
the
first
regiment
i
was
so
good
here
it
seems
there
was
something
wrong
with
my
technique
the
coal
pile
had
ruined
me
for
delicate
work
i
continually
kept
mistaking
the
plate
in
my
hand
for
a
shovel
a
mistake
which
led
to
disastrous
results
i
will
say
this
for
the
chiefs
however
they
were
as
a
body
of
men
as
i
have
ever
met
it
was
a
pleasure
to
feed
them
particularly
so
in
the
case
of
one
chief
a
venerable
gentleman
who
seemed
both
by
his
bearing
and
the
number
of
stripes
on
his
sleeve
to
be
the
dean
of
the
mess
he
ate
quietly
composedly
and
to
the
point
and
after
i
had
spilled
a
couple
of
plates
of
rations
on
several
of
the
other
laps
he
suggested
that
i
call
it
a
day
and
be
withdrawn
in
favor
of
one
whose
services
to
his
country
were
not
so
invaluable
as
mine
appreciating
his
delicacy
i
withdrew
but
only
to
be
sent
out
on
another
job
that
defies
description
even
here
i
quickly
demonstrated
my
unfitness
and
have
consequently
been
incorporated
once
more
into
the
body
of
my
regiment
i
had
the
most
terrible
experience
in
mess
when
a
guy
having
eaten
more
rapidly
than
i
attempted
to
take
my
ration
when
i
told
him
he
should
do
it
he
merely
laughed
brutally
and
kicked
me
an
awful
whack
on
the
shin
this
injury
together
with
the
sight
of
witnessing
my
food
about
to
be
crammed
down
his
predatory
maw
succeeded
in
bringing
all
my
latent
patriotism
to
the
fore
and
i
fell
upon
him
with
a
desperation
bred
of
hunger
we
proceeded
to
mill
it
up
in
a
rather
futile
childish
manner
until
the
suggested
in
a
certain
way
he
has
that
we
go
away
to
somewhere
else
hereafter
if
any
one
asks
if
i
did
any
actual
fighting
in
this
war
i
am
going
to
say
yes
i
fought
like
hell
many
hard
and
long
battles
in
camp
for
my
ration
which
will
be
true
say
buddy
said
my
opponent
after
we
had
landed
quite
violently
on
the
exterior
of
the
mess
hall
you
did
git
no
food
at
all
did
yer
no
i
replied
bitterly
at
all
is
right
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
in
a
strange
studying
manner
then
began
laughing
softly
to
himself
i
do
know
what
made
me
do
it
he
said
more
to
himself
than
to
me
i
was
hungry
no
more
i
did
want
it
i
wonder
what
makes
a
guy
brutal
guess
he
sort
of
has
a
feelin
to
experiment
with
himself
and
other
folks
i
wish
you
tried
that
experiment
on
some
one
else
i
replied
thinking
tenderly
of
my
shin
sometimes
i
feel
so
doggon
strong
and
mean
he
continued
i
just
ca
keep
from
doing
things
i
do
naturally
feel
like
doing
i
guess
i
sort
of
an
animal
say
i
asked
him
in
surprise
if
you
keep
talking
about
yourself
that
way
i
wo
be
able
to
call
you
all
the
names
i
am
carefully
preparing
at
this
moment
he
peered
earnestly
down
on
me
for
a
space
does
my
face
make
you
talk
that
way
i
asked
feeling
dimly
and
uncomfortably
that
it
did
yes
he
replied
it
your
face
your
foolish
looking
face
i
help
feeling
sorry
for
it
and
your
funny
empty
little
belly
you
breaking
me
down
i
answered
i
ca
stand
kindness
i
ai
no
bully
he
said
fiercely
as
if
he
was
about
to
strike
me
i
ai
no
bully
he
repeated
i
tell
you
that
no
sir
i
replied
soothingly
keeping
on
the
alert
you
ai
no
bully
here
he
took
me
by
the
arm
and
dragged
me
along
with
him
come
on
buddy
he
said
i
going
to
take
you
to
the
canteen
and
feed
you
i
going
to
do
it
i
swear
to
god
so
he
fed
me
stacks
and
stacks
of
stuff
he
forced
on
me
until
the
flesh
rebelled
after
which
he
put
things
in
my
pockets
repeating
every
little
while
i
ai
no
bully
i
tell
you
that
i
ai
no
bully
he
spent
most
of
his
money
i
reckon
but
i
did
not
try
to
stop
him
he
wanted
to
do
it
and
i
guess
it
made
him
feel
better
after
the
orgy
i
took
him
around
and
let
him
pat
fogerty
he
seemed
to
like
this
fogerty
took
it
in
good
part
there
something
about
wednesday
afternoons
that
appeal
to
me
first
they
make
you
go
away
and
dress
yourself
up
nice
and
clean
and
then
they
look
you
over
and
make
you
feel
nearly
as
childish
as
you
look
then
they
put
a
gun
into
your
hand
that
is
much
too
heavy
for
comfort
and
make
you
do
all
sorts
of
ridiculous
things
with
this
gun
after
which
you
fall
in
with
numerous
thousands
of
other
men
who
have
been
subjected
to
the
same
treatment
and
together
we
all
go
trotting
past
any
number
of
officers
who
look
you
over
with
uncanny
earnestness
through
eyes
that
seem
to
perceive
the
remotest
defect
with
fiendish
accuracy
then
we
all
trot
home
again
and
call
it
a
review
this
is
all
very
well
for
some
people
but
not
for
me
i
a
little
too
i
have
always
the
feeling
that
i
am
the
review
that
it
has
been
staged
particularly
for
my
discomforture
and
that
every
officer
in
camp
is
on
the
lookout
for
any
slight
irregularity
in
my
clothes
or
conduct
in
this
they
have
little
difficulty
i
assist
them
greatly
myself
for
instance
item
one
dropped
my
gun
item
two
talked
in
ranks
i
asked
the
guy
next
to
me
how
he
would
like
to
go
to
a
place
and
he
said
that
he
see
me
there
first
item
three
failed
to
follow
the
guide
item
four
did
mark
time
correctly
item
five
was
in
step
once
now
all
of
these
things
are
trifling
in
themselves
but
taken
en
mass
as
it
were
it
leads
up
to
a
sizable
display
at
least
so
i
was
told
in
words
that
denied
any
other
interpretation
by
my
and
several
pals
of
his
after
the
review
our
regimental
commander
lined
us
up
and
addressed
us
as
follows
about
that
review
he
began
it
was
terrible
long
dramatic
pause
it
was
probably
the
worst
review
i
have
ever
seen
several
glanced
at
me
reproachfully
not
only
that
he
continued
but
it
was
the
worst
review
that
anybody
has
ever
seen
anybody
shouted
without
exception
shouted
awful
review
pause
terrible
we
steadied
in
the
ranks
and
waited
for
our
doom
it
will
never
be
so
again
he
continued
i
see
to
that
drill
ye
myself
if
you
have
to
get
up
at
four
in
the
morning
to
drill
in
order
to
meet
your
classes
i
see
that
ye
do
it
dropping
guns
pause
talking
in
ranks
pause
terrible
pause
marking
time
wrong
everything
wrong
company
commanders
take
away
we
were
took
all
of
those
things
said
my
in
a
trembling
voice
you
did
all
of
now
the
old
man
sore
on
us
and
he
going
to
give
us
hell
and
i
going
to
do
the
same
by
you
shoot
dearie
says
i
with
the
desperate
indifference
of
a
man
who
has
nothing
left
to
lose
i
would
feel
natural
if
you
did
and
in
my
hammock
that
night
i
thought
of
another
thing
i
might
have
said
if
it
had
occurred
to
me
in
time
i
might
have
said
hell
is
the
only
thing
you
know
how
to
give
and
you
generous
with
that
because
it
free
but
i
guess
after
all
it
just
as
well
i
did
fogerty
has
returned
aboard
my
worst
fears
are
realized
for
a
long
time
he
has
been
irritable
and
uncommunicative
with
me
and
has
indulged
in
sly
furtive
little
tricks
unbecoming
to
a
dog
of
the
service
i
have
suspected
that
he
was
concealing
a
love
affair
from
me
this
it
appears
he
has
been
doing
and
his
guilt
is
heavy
upon
him
i
realize
now
for
the
first
time
and
not
without
a
sharp
maternal
pang
that
he
has
reached
an
age
at
which
he
must
make
decisions
for
himself
i
can
no
longer
follow
him
out
into
the
world
upon
his
nocturnal
exploits
his
entire
confidence
is
not
mine
i
must
be
content
to
share
a
part
of
his
heart
instead
of
the
whole
of
it
like
father
like
son
i
suppose
however
i
see
no
reason
for
him
to
put
on
such
airs
on
his
return
from
city
island
this
time
he
had
somehow
contrived
to
get
himself
completely
shaved
up
to
the
shoulders
the
result
is
startling
fogerty
looks
extremely
aristocratic
but
a
trifle
foppish
however
he
seems
to
consider
himself
the
only
real
dog
in
camp
this
is
a
trifle
boring
from
a
dog
who
has
never
hesitated
to
steal
from
the
galley
anything
that
was
a
permanent
fixture
i
ca
help
but
feel
sorry
for
him
though
when
i
see
that
look
in
his
eyes
sad
days
i
fear
are
in
store
for
him
ah
well
we
only
young
once
well
now
son
he
was
saying
mind
me
when
i
tell
yer
that
i
not
claiming
as
to
ever
have
seen
a
mermaid
but
what
i
am
saying
is
this
and
that
is
if
anybody
has
ever
seen
one
of
them
things
i
that
man
i
not
making
no
false
claims
however
none
whatsoever
i
carefully
placed
my
shovel
against
the
wheelbarrow
and
seating
myself
upon
a
stump
prepared
to
listen
to
my
companion
he
was
a
chief
of
many
cruises
and
for
some
unaccountable
reason
had
fixed
on
me
as
being
a
suitable
recipient
for
his
discourse
one
more
hash
mark
on
his
arm
would
have
made
him
look
like
a
convict
i
listened
and
in
the
meanwhile
many
mounds
of
sand
urgently
in
need
of
shoveling
remained
undisturbed
upon
this
sand
i
occasionally
cast
a
reflective
and
apprehensive
eye
the
chief
noticing
this
nudged
me
in
the
ribs
with
an
angular
elbow
do
mind
that
sonny
he
said
i
pump
the
into
the
heart
of
any
what
endeavors
to
disturb
you
trust
me
i
did
now
getting
back
to
this
mermaid
he
began
in
a
confidential
voice
what
i
say
as
i
did
claim
to
have
saw
it
happened
this
way
and
what
i
telling
you
sonny
is
the
plain
unvarnished
facts
of
the
case
take
or
leave
as
you
will
they
happened
and
i
here
to
tell
the
whole
world
so
i
have
every
confidence
in
you
chief
i
replied
mildly
it
is
well
you
have
he
growled
scanning
my
face
suspiciously
it
well
you
have
you
louse
why
chief
i
exclaimed
in
an
aggrieved
voice
is
that
rather
an
unappetizing
word
to
apply
to
a
fellow
creature
mayhap
young
feller
he
replied
mayhap
i
ai
no
deep
sea
dictionary
diver
i
ai
but
all
this
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
what
i
was
about
to
tell
you
it
all
happened
after
this
manner
neither
no
more
nor
no
less
he
cleared
his
throat
and
gazed
with
undisguised
hostility
across
the
parade
ground
thus
he
began
it
was
during
the
summer
of
some
thirty
odd
years
ago
quoth
he
i
was
a
bit
young
then
but
never
such
a
whey
face
as
you
certainly
not
positively
said
i
in
hearty
agreement
at
that
time
he
continued
not
noticing
my
remark
i
was
resting
easy
on
a
soft
job
between
cruises
as
night
watchman
on
one
of
them
docks
at
dover
the
work
war
hard
but
it
was
hard
enough
i
would
never
have
taken
it
had
it
not
been
for
the
unpleasant
fact
that
owing
to
some
little
trouble
i
had
gotten
into
at
one
of
the
pubs
my
wife
was
in
one
of
her
nasty
moods
at
these
times
the
solitude
and
the
stars
together
with
the
grateful
companionship
of
a
couple
of
buckets
of
beer
was
greatly
to
be
preferred
to
my
little
old
home
so
i
took
the
job
and
accordingly
spent
my
nights
sitting
with
my
back
to
a
pile
my
legs
comfortably
stretched
out
along
the
rim
of
the
dock
and
a
bucket
of
beer
within
easy
reach
could
anything
be
fairer
than
that
said
i
nothing
said
he
and
continued
well
one
night
as
i
was
sitting
there
looking
down
in
the
water
as
a
man
does
when
his
mind
is
empty
and
his
body
well
disposed
i
found
myself
gazing
down
into
two
glowing
pools
that
were
the
reflections
of
stars
above
these
two
flecks
of
light
was
perched
a
battered
old
leghorn
hat
after
the
style
affected
in
the
music
halls
of
those
days
floating
out
back
of
this
hat
on
the
water
was
a
long
wavery
coil
of
filmy
hair
the
face
was
shaded
but
two
long
slim
arms
were
thrust
out
of
the
water
toward
me
and
following
these
arms
down
a
bit
i
was
shocked
and
surprised
to
find
that
further
than
the
hat
the
young
lady
below
me
was
apparently
innocent
of
garments
now
i
believe
in
going
out
with
the
boys
when
the
occasion
demands
and
making
a
bit
of
a
time
of
it
but
my
folks
have
always
been
good
honest
church
people
and
believers
in
good
strong
modest
clothing
and
plenty
of
i
have
always
followed
their
example
reluctantly
and
at
a
great
distance
said
i
not
at
all
said
he
and
continued
so
when
i
sees
the
condition
the
young
lady
was
in
i
was
naturally
very
much
put
out
and
i
hesitate
telling
her
so
home
says
i
put
your
clothes
on
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
a
great
big
girl
like
you
pipe
down
old
grizzle
face
says
she
have
you
got
in
the
bucket
and
if
you
will
believe
me
she
began
raising
herself
out
of
the
water
me
some
says
she
i
cries
out
exasperated
where
you
are
you
gone
far
enough
for
shame
come
all
the
way
out
says
she
laughing
you
give
me
some
of
wot
you
got
in
that
bucket
i
repeated
you
got
no
sense
of
decency
wot
so
ever
she
replied
i
awfully
thirsty
gim
me
a
drink
or
out
i
come
now
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
i
could
afford
to
have
a
woman
in
her
sitting
around
with
me
on
the
end
of
a
dock
being
married
as
i
was
and
my
folks
all
good
honest
church
folks
and
bright
moon
shining
in
the
sky
to
boot
so
i
was
just
naturally
forced
to
give
in
to
the
brazen
thing
and
reach
her
down
the
bucket
a
full
one
at
that
it
came
back
empty
and
she
was
forwarder
than
ever
she
cries
out
swimming
around
most
exasperatingly
a
nice
old
party
what
do
your
folks
know
you
by
i
told
her
my
name
was
none
of
her
business
and
that
i
was
a
married
man
and
that
i
wished
she
go
away
and
let
me
go
on
with
my
night
watching
married
too
says
she
in
a
conversational
tone
an
awful
mess
you
pretty
fuzzy
but
i
swap
him
for
you
any
day
come
on
into
the
sea
with
me
and
we
swim
down
to
gold
fish
arms
and
stick
around
until
we
get
a
drink
i
know
lots
of
the
boys
down
there
there
ai
no
liquor
dealers
where
i
come
from
and
with
this
if
you
will
believe
me
she
flips
a
bucket
full
of
water
into
my
lap
with
the
neatest
little
scale
spangled
tail
you
ever
seen
says
i
mind
made
up
i
ai
agoing
to
go
swimming
around
with
no
altogether
nude
mermaid
it
ai
right
it
ai
christian
got
a
hat
says
she
reflectively
i
ai
so
stewed
but
wot
i
ca
swim
wot
do
you
think
of
that
hat
one
of
the
boys
stole
it
from
his
old
woman
and
gave
it
to
me
come
on
let
take
a
swim
says
i
ai
agoing
i
ai
all
dolled
up
in
a
lot
of
clothes
says
she
says
i
partly
because
you
are
a
mermaid
i
agoing
messing
around
through
the
water
with
no
mermaid
i
ai
never
done
it
and
i
ai
agoing
to
begin
it
now
i
get
some
clothes
on
and
dress
all
up
pretty
will
you
go
swimming
with
me
then
she
asks
pleadingly
that
another
thing
says
i
noncommittal
like
right
says
she
gim
me
something
out
of
that
other
bucket
and
i
go
away
come
on
old
sweetheart
and
she
held
up
her
arms
to
me
well
i
gave
her
the
bucket
and
true
to
form
she
emptied
it
then
she
began
to
argue
and
plead
with
me
until
i
nearly
lost
an
ear
i
yells
at
her
ai
agoing
to
spend
the
night
arguing
with
a
drunken
mermaid
go
away
now
you
said
you
would
right
old
love
she
replies
i
see
you
again
some
time
i
ai
ever
going
home
again
i
hate
it
down
there
and
off
she
swims
in
an
unsteady
manner
in
the
direction
of
the
gold
fish
arms
she
was
singing
and
shouting
something
terrible
bury
me
not
on
the
lonesome
prairie
where
the
wild
coyotes
howl
me
was
the
song
she
sang
and
i
wondered
where
she
had
ever
picked
it
up
well
continued
the
chief
to
cast
a
sheep
shank
in
a
long
line
these
visits
kept
up
every
evening
until
i
was
pretty
near
drove
distracted
along
she
come
about
and
stick
around
me
and
drinking
up
all
my
grog
after
a
while
she
began
calling
for
gin
and
kept
threatening
me
until
i
just
had
to
satisfy
her
she
also
made
me
buy
her
a
brush
and
comb
a
mouth
organ
and
a
pair
of
spectacles
together
with
a
lot
of
other
stuff
on
the
strength
of
the
fact
that
if
i
refused
she
would
make
a
scene
in
this
way
that
doggon
mermaid
continually
kept
me
broke
for
my
wage
war
enough
to
make
me
heavy
and
i
had
my
home
to
support
you
ever
go
home
i
asked
her
one
night
she
replied
ai
ever
going
back
home
i
do
like
it
down
there
there
ai
no
liquor
dealers
your
husband
exclaims
i
of
him
know
says
she
i
do
like
him
and
i
off
my
baby
too
it
squints
says
she
all
babies
squint
says
i
should
says
she
ai
right
then
one
night
an
awful
thing
happened
my
wife
came
down
to
the
dock
to
find
out
how
i
spent
all
my
money
it
was
a
bright
night
and
this
lost
soul
of
a
mermaid
was
hanging
around
particularly
jilled
and
entreating
i
was
just
in
the
act
of
passing
her
down
the
gin
flask
and
she
was
saying
to
me
on
down
old
love
you
know
you
crazy
about
me
when
all
of
a
sudden
i
heard
an
infuriated
shriek
behind
me
and
saw
my
wife
leaning
over
the
dock
shaking
an
umbrella
at
this
huzzy
of
a
mermaid
oh
son
broke
off
the
chief
if
you
only
knew
the
uncontrolled
violence
and
fury
of
two
contending
women
nothing
you
meet
on
shipboard
will
ever
equal
it
i
was
speechless
rocked
in
the
surf
of
a
tumult
of
words
and
in
the
midst
of
it
all
what
should
happen
but
the
husband
of
the
mermaid
pops
out
of
the
water
with
a
funny
little
bit
of
a
merbaby
in
his
arms
home
at
once
sir
screams
my
wife
put
on
your
clothes
will
he
shouts
back
my
wife
will
come
along
with
me
he
was
a
weazened
up
little
old
man
with
a
crooked
back
not
very
prepossessing
i
could
hardly
blame
his
wife
that
bit
of
stuff
is
your
wife
is
it
cries
out
my
old
lady
and
with
that
she
began
telling
him
her
past
know
it
says
the
little
old
merman
at
last
almost
crying
know
it
but
i
ai
got
no
control
over
her
whatsoever
i
been
trying
to
get
her
to
come
home
for
the
last
fortnight
but
she
just
wo
leave
off
going
around
with
the
sailors
the
whole
beach
is
ashamed
of
her
it
general
talk
down
below
what
can
i
do
the
little
old
coral
house
is
going
to
wrack
and
ruin
and
the
baby
been
properly
took
care
of
since
she
left
what
am
i
going
to
do
madam
what
am
i
going
to
do
i
well
nigh
distracted
but
his
wife
was
too
taken
up
with
the
gin
bottle
to
pay
much
heed
to
his
pitiful
words
she
just
kept
flirting
around
in
the
water
and
singing
snatches
of
bad
sailor
songs
she
picked
up
around
the
docks
her
home
said
my
wife
her
home
you
weakling
by
force
i
ca
when
she
in
this
condition
i
got
a
child
in
my
arms
me
the
baby
said
my
wife
with
sudden
determination
take
care
of
it
until
night
when
you
can
come
back
here
and
get
it
he
handed
the
flopping
little
thing
up
to
my
wife
and
turned
to
the
mermaid
he
says
to
her
holding
out
his
arms
to
her
will
you
come
home
lil
swims
up
to
him
then
and
takes
him
by
the
arm
and
looks
at
him
for
a
long
time
me
archie
she
says
suddenly
do
mind
if
i
do
and
flipping
a
couple
of
pounds
of
water
upon
the
both
of
us
on
the
pier
she
pulls
him
under
the
water
laughing
and
that
the
last
i
saw
of
either
of
them
now
i
ai
asaying
as
i
have
ever
seen
a
mermaid
mind
you
continued
the
chief
but
what
i
do
say
is
that
if
any
man
has
ever
seen
one
i
the
man
i
understand
perfectly
said
i
and
what
chief
became
of
the
baby
oh
the
baby
said
the
chief
thoughtful
like
the
baby
well
you
see
about
that
baby
he
gazed
searchingly
around
the
landscape
for
a
moment
before
replying
oh
the
baby
he
said
suddenly
as
if
greatly
relieved
well
my
wife
took
the
baby
home
and
kept
it
in
the
bathtub
for
a
couple
of
days
after
which
she
returned
it
in
person
to
its
father
she
made
me
give
up
my
job
it
did
squint
though
said
the
chief
as
he
got
up
to
go
ever
so
little
i
turned
to
my
shovel
but
i
ai
saying
as
i
have
ever
seen
a
mermaid
he
said
turning
back
in
his
tracks
all
i
saying
is
that
i
know
chief
i
said
wearily
i
fully
appreciate
your
delicacy
and
fairness
you
not
the
man
to
make
any
false
claims
no
sir
not
i
he
replied
as
he
walked
slowly
away
in
order
to
distract
fogerty
attention
from
his
love
affair
and
in
a
sort
of
desperate
endeavor
to
win
him
back
to
me
i
took
him
away
on
my
last
liberty
with
me
fogerty
does
come
under
the
heading
of
a
lap
dog
but
through
some
technical
quibble
i
managed
to
smuggle
him
into
the
subway
all
he
did
there
was
to
knock
over
one
elderly
lady
and
lick
her
face
effusively
when
he
had
gotten
her
down
this
resulted
in
a
small
but
complete
panic
for
the
most
part
however
he
sat
quietly
on
my
lap
and
sniffed
at
those
around
him
at
last
we
reached
washington
square
whereupon
i
proceeded
to
take
fogerty
around
and
show
him
off
to
my
friends
he
was
well
received
but
his
heart
was
with
us
it
was
far
away
in
city
island
illustration
for
the
most
part
however
he
sat
quietly
on
my
lap
and
sniffed
at
one
restaurant
we
ran
into
a
female
whose
hair
was
nearly
as
short
as
fogerty
she
was
holding
forth
on
the
silence
of
the
soul
the
love
impulse
the
cabbage
or
some
other
plant
fogerty
listened
to
her
for
a
while
and
then
bit
her
he
did
it
quietly
but
i
thought
it
best
to
take
him
away
after
supper
we
went
up
to
another
place
for
coffee
a
fine
little
place
for
sailormen
situated
on
the
south
side
of
the
square
here
we
were
received
with
winning
cordiality
and
fogerty
was
given
a
fried
egg
a
dish
of
which
he
is
passionately
fond
but
even
here
he
got
into
trouble
by
putting
one
of
his
great
feet
through
a
ukulele
which
is
such
a
terrible
thing
to
do
except
in
certain
places
getting
back
to
the
station
was
a
crisp
little
affair
fogerty
and
myself
rose
at
five
and
went
forth
to
the
shuttle
the
subway
was
a
madhouse
we
shuttled
ourselves
to
death
at
we
were
at
the
times
square
end
of
the
shuttle
at
we
were
at
williams
at
we
had
somehow
managed
to
get
ourselves
on
the
east
side
end
of
the
shuttle
five
minutes
later
we
were
back
at
times
square
ten
minutes
later
we
were
over
on
the
east
side
once
more
at
i
lost
fogerty
at
i
was
back
at
times
square
hello
buddy
said
the
guard
you
back
again
here
your
dog
at
we
were
at
van
cortlandt
park
at
we
were
at
street
found
us
laboring
up
to
the
gate
of
the
camp
with
a
written
list
of
excuses
that
looked
like
the
schedule
of
a
flourishing
railroad
it
was
accepted
much
to
our
surprise
i
have
a
perfectly
splendid
idea
of
course
like
the
rest
of
my
ideas
it
wo
work
but
it
is
a
perfectly
splendid
idea
for
all
that
i
got
it
while
traveling
on
the
ferry
boat
from
new
york
to
staten
island
the
longest
sea
voyage
i
have
had
since
i
joined
the
navy
on
this
trip
strangely
thrilling
to
a
sailor
in
my
situation
but
which
was
suffered
with
bored
indifference
by
the
amphibious
commuters
that
infest
this
island
in
those
waters
i
saw
a
number
of
ships
so
gaudily
and
at
the
same
time
so
carelessly
painted
that
any
skipper
of
the
spanish
main
would
positively
have
refused
to
command
captain
kidd
himself
would
have
blushed
at
the
very
sight
of
this
ribald
fleet
and
turned
away
with
a
devout
imprecation
this
was
my
first
experience
with
camouflage
and
it
impressed
me
most
unfavorably
an
ordinary
ship
on
a
grumbling
ocean
is
difficult
enough
as
it
is
to
establish
friendly
relations
with
but
when
trigged
out
in
this
manner
why
serve
meals
at
all
say
i
nevertheless
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
not
be
a
bad
idea
at
all
to
camouflage
hammock
in
such
a
manner
that
it
took
upon
itself
the
texture
and
appearance
of
the
bulkhead
of
the
barracks
in
which
it
was
swung
in
this
manner
a
sailor
could
sleep
undisturbed
for
three
weeks
if
he
so
desired
and
he
does
without
ever
being
technically
considered
a
deserter
one
could
elaborate
this
idea
still
further
and
make
one
sea
bag
look
like
a
clump
of
poison
ivy
so
that
no
inspecting
officer
would
ever
care
to
become
intimate
with
its
numerous
defects
in
cleanliness
one
might
even
go
so
far
as
to
camouflage
oneself
into
a
writing
desk
so
that
when
visiting
the
y
or
the
and
unexpectedly
required
to
sing
one
would
not
be
forced
to
rise
and
scream
impatiently
and
threateningly
dear
mother
mine
or
break
the
news
to
mother
not
that
these
songs
are
not
things
of
rare
beauty
in
themselves
but
after
a
day
on
the
coal
pile
one
lungs
have
been
sufficiently
exercised
to
warrant
relief
this
is
merely
an
idea
of
mine
and
now
that
everybody
knows
about
it
i
guess
there
is
much
use
in
going
ahead
with
it
this
guide
shouted
the
and
naturally
i
looked
around
to
see
what
had
become
of
the
poor
fellow
keep
your
head
straight
eyes
to
the
front
do
move
whatcha
lookin
at
i
was
looking
for
the
guide
that
was
left
says
i
timidly
it
seems
to
me
that
he
is
always
being
left
company
dismissed
said
the
promptly
showing
a
wonderful
command
of
the
situation
under
rather
trying
circumstances
for
the
that
went
up
from
the
men
after
my
remark
defied
all
restraints
of
discipline
say
biltmore
says
the
to
me
a
moment
later
i
going
to
see
if
i
ca
get
you
shipped
to
siberia
if
you
pull
one
of
them
bum
jokes
again
you
understand
but
i
was
joking
i
replied
innocently
aw
go
on
you
sly
dog
said
he
nudging
me
in
the
ribs
and
for
some
strange
reason
he
departed
in
high
good
humor
leaving
me
in
a
greatly
mystified
frame
of
mind
speaking
of
getting
shipped
i
have
just
written
a
very
sad
song
in
the
style
of
the
old
sentimental
ballads
of
the
spanish
war
days
called
the
sailor
farewell
and
i
think
polly
will
like
it
i
have
polished
it
up
yet
but
here
it
is
as
it
is
a
sailor
to
his
mother
came
and
said
oh
mother
dear
i
got
to
go
away
and
fight
the
war
so
mother
do
you
cry
too
hard
and
do
you
have
no
fear
when
you
find
that
i
not
sticking
no
more
my
boy
the
sweet
old
lady
said
i
hate
to
see
you
go
i
knowed
you
since
when
you
was
but
a
kid
but
if
the
question
you
should
ask
i
tell
the
whole
world
so
it
the
only
decent
thing
you
ever
did
a
tear
she
brushed
aside
and
then
she
sadly
cried
chorus
i
proud
my
boy
a
sailor
man
what
sails
upon
the
sea
i
always
liked
him
pretty
well
although
he
is
so
dumb
for
years
he
stuck
around
the
house
and
disappointed
me
i
thought
that
he
was
going
to
be
a
bum
he
took
her
gently
by
the
hand
and
kissed
her
on
the
bean
and
said
when
i
about
to
fight
the
hun
you
should
talk
to
me
that
way
i
think
it
awfully
mean
i
ai
agoin
to
have
a
lot
of
fun
i
know
my
child
the
mother
said
the
parting
makes
me
sad
but
go
you
must
away
and
fight
the
war
at
least
you
will
not
live
to
drink
as
much
as
did
your
dad
so
here
your
lid
my
lad
and
there
the
door
then
as
he
turned
away
he
heard
her
softly
say
chorus
the
sailors
i
have
ever
loved
i
glad
my
lad
a
gob
although
it
seems
to
me
he
much
too
dumb
but
after
all
perhaps
he
is
such
an
awful
slob
i
always
knew
that
kaiser
was
a
bum
the
best
way
to
make
a
deserter
of
a
man
is
to
give
him
too
much
liberty
for
the
past
week
i
have
been
getting
my
dog
fogerty
on
numerous
liberty
lists
when
he
should
have
been
there
but
not
contented
with
that
he
has
taken
to
going
around
with
a
couple
of
yeomen
and
the
first
thing
i
know
he
will
be
getting
on
a
special
detail
where
the
liberty
is
soft
i
put
nothing
past
that
dog
since
he
lost
his
head
to
some
huzzy
with
a
black
and
tan
reputation
all
day
long
and
a
little
longer
i
have
been
carrying
sacks
of
flour
the
next
time
i
see
a
stalk
of
wheat
i
am
going
to
snarl
at
it
this
new
occupation
is
a
sort
of
special
penance
for
not
having
my
hammock
lashed
in
time
it
seems
that
i
have
been
in
the
service
long
enough
to
know
how
to
do
the
thing
right
by
now
but
the
seventh
hitch
is
a
sly
little
devil
and
always
gets
me
i
need
a
longer
line
or
a
shorter
hammock
but
the
only
way
out
of
it
that
i
can
see
is
to
get
a
commission
and
rate
a
bed
illustration
i
carried
all
the
flour
that
was
raised
last
year
in
the
southern
section
of
the
state
of
montana
i
carried
all
the
flour
that
was
raised
last
year
in
the
southern
section
of
the
state
of
montana
and
i
was
carrying
it
well
and
cheerfully
until
one
of
my
pet
finger
nails
the
one
that
the
manicure
girls
in
the
biltmore
used
to
rave
about
thrust
itself
through
the
sack
and
precipitated
its
contents
upon
myself
and
the
floor
a
commissary
steward
when
thoroughly
aroused
is
a
poisonous
member
of
society
one
would
have
thought
that
i
had
sunk
the
great
fleet
the
way
this
bird
went
on
about
one
little
sack
of
flour
here
hoover
works
hard
night
and
day
all
winter
he
sobs
at
me
and
you
go
spreading
it
around
as
if
you
were
marie
antoinette
i
wondered
what
new
scandal
he
had
about
marie
antoinette
but
i
held
my
peace
my
horror
was
so
great
that
the
real
color
of
my
face
made
the
flour
look
like
a
coat
of
sunburn
in
comparison
there
enough
flour
there
he
continued
reproachfully
pointing
to
the
huge
mound
of
stuff
in
which
i
stood
like
a
lost
explorer
on
a
mountain
peak
and
wishing
heartily
that
i
was
one
there
enough
flour
he
continued
to
keep
a
chief
petty
officer
in
pie
for
hours
just
about
thought
i
to
myself
well
he
cried
irritably
pick
it
up
be
quick
pick
it
up
all
of
it
pick
it
up
i
replied
through
a
cloud
of
mist
you
ca
pick
up
flour
you
can
pick
up
apples
and
pears
and
cabbages
and
cigarette
butts
for
that
matter
but
you
ca
pick
up
flour
the
commissary
steward
suddenly
handed
me
a
piece
of
paper
upon
which
he
had
been
writing
frantically
take
this
to
your
he
said
shrilly
and
take
yourself
along
with
it
a
defect
in
the
sack
i
gasped
departing
and
there
a
defect
in
you
he
shouted
after
me
your
brain
is
exempted
take
this
man
and
kill
him
if
you
can
find
any
slight
technical
excuse
for
it
the
note
ran
and
if
you
ca
kill
him
give
him
an
inaptitude
discharge
with
my
compliments
and
if
you
are
unable
to
do
either
of
these
two
things
at
least
keep
him
away
from
my
outfit
we
do
want
to
see
his
silly
face
around
here
any
more
at
all
the
read
it
to
me
with
great
delight
i
guess
we
have
to
send
you
to
siberia
after
all
he
said
thoughtfully
only
that
country
is
in
far
too
delicate
a
condition
for
you
to
meddle
with
at
present
go
away
to
somewhere
where
i
see
you
he
continued
bitterly
for
i
feel
inclined
to
do
you
an
injury
something
permanent
and
serious
i
went
right
away
mother
has
just
paid
one
of
her
belligerent
visits
to
the
camp
and
as
a
consequence
i
am
on
the
point
of
having
a
flock
of
brainstorms
some
misguided
person
had
been
telling
her
about
the
officer
training
school
up
here
and
she
arrived
fired
with
the
ambition
to
enter
me
into
that
institution
without
further
delay
true
to
form
she
bounded
headlong
into
the
matter
without
consulting
my
feelings
by
accosting
the
very
first
commissioned
officer
she
met
he
happened
to
be
an
ensign
but
he
might
as
well
have
been
a
for
all
mother
cared
tell
me
young
man
she
said
to
this
ensign
going
directly
to
the
point
do
you
see
any
reason
why
my
boy
oswald
should
not
go
to
that
place
where
they
make
all
the
ensigns
yes
said
the
officer
firmly
i
do
oh
you
do
snapped
mother
angrily
and
pray
tell
me
what
that
reason
might
be
your
son
oswald
replied
the
ensign
laconically
what
exclaimed
mother
you
mean
to
say
that
my
oswald
is
not
good
enough
to
go
to
your
silly
old
school
no
replied
the
ensign
weakening
pitifully
before
the
withering
fury
of
an
aroused
mother
but
you
see
my
dear
madam
he
has
not
a
first
class
rating
fiddlesticks
said
mother
crossed
anchors
replied
the
ensign
i
did
mean
that
continued
mother
i
think
the
whole
thing
is
very
mysterious
and
silly
and
i
not
going
to
let
it
stop
here
you
can
trust
me
oswald
she
went
on
soothingly
i
am
going
to
see
the
commander
of
the
station
myself
i
am
going
this
very
instant
but
mother
i
cried
in
desperation
tossing
all
consequences
to
the
wind
the
is
on
the
station
he
got
a
liberty
i
saw
him
check
out
of
the
gate
myself
for
a
moment
the
ensign
jaw
dropped
i
watched
him
anxiously
then
with
perfect
composure
he
turned
to
mother
and
came
through
like
a
little
gentleman
yes
madam
he
stated
your
son
is
right
i
heard
his
name
read
out
with
the
liberty
party
only
a
moment
ago
he
has
shoved
off
by
now
i
could
have
kissed
that
ensign
well
i
sure
said
mother
it
very
funny
that
i
can
never
get
to
the
captain
i
shall
write
him
however
he
must
have
an
interesting
collection
of
your
letters
already
i
suggested
they
would
be
interesting
to
publish
in
book
form
anyway
continued
mother
apparently
not
attending
to
my
remark
i
think
you
would
look
just
as
well
as
this
young
man
in
one
of
those
nice
white
suits
no
doubt
madam
replied
the
ensign
propitiatingly
no
doubt
come
mother
said
i
let
go
to
the
i
need
something
cool
to
steady
my
nerves
how
about
your
underwear
said
mother
coming
back
to
her
mania
in
a
voice
that
invited
all
within
earshot
who
were
interested
in
my
underwear
to
draw
nigh
and
attend
here
eat
this
ice
cream
i
put
in
quickly
almost
feeding
her
it
melting
but
mother
was
not
to
be
decoyed
away
from
her
favorite
topic
i
must
look
it
over
she
continued
firmly
it
seemed
to
me
that
every
eye
in
the
room
was
calmly
penetrating
my
whites
and
carefully
looking
over
the
underwear
in
which
mother
took
such
an
exaggerated
interest
socks
suddenly
exploded
mother
how
are
you
off
for
socks
splendidly
i
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
a
girl
behind
me
snickered
and
have
you
that
liniment
to
rub
on
your
stomach
when
you
have
cramps
she
went
on
ruggedly
enough
to
last
through
the
fall
season
i
replied
in
a
moody
voice
i
did
tell
her
that
tim
the
barkeep
had
tried
to
drink
it
polly
suddenly
exclaimed
mother
polly
why
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
she
said
that
she
would
be
up
this
afternoon
she
must
be
here
now
the
world
swam
around
me
polly
was
my
favorite
sweetie
oh
mother
i
cried
reproachfully
how
could
you
have
forgotten
at
that
moment
i
heard
a
familiar
voice
issuing
from
the
corner
and
turning
around
i
caught
sight
of
the
staff
reporter
of
the
camp
paper
a
notoriously
unscrupulous
sailor
with
predatory
proclivities
he
had
gotten
polly
in
a
corner
and
was
chinning
the
ear
off
of
her
as
i
drew
near
i
heard
him
saying
really
it
an
awful
pity
but
i
distinctly
remember
him
saying
that
he
was
going
away
on
liberty
he
mentioned
some
girl
name
but
it
did
sound
anything
at
all
like
yours
polly
looked
at
him
trustfully
are
you
sure
savanrola
the
lying
wretch
supplied
without
turning
a
hair
are
you
sure
savanrola
that
he
has
left
the
station
saw
him
check
out
with
my
own
eyes
he
said
calmly
i
moved
nearer
my
hands
twitching
now
with
an
honest
old
seafaring
man
like
myself
he
continued
in
a
confidential
voice
it
different
why
if
i
should
wear
all
the
hash
marks
i
rate
i
look
like
a
zebra
so
i
just
do
wear
any
you
know
how
it
is
but
when
i
like
a
girl
i
stick
to
her
now
from
the
very
first
moment
i
laid
eyes
on
you
human
endurance
could
stand
no
more
i
threw
myself
between
them
why
here
oswald
hisself
exclaimed
the
reporter
with
masterfully
feigned
surprise
however
did
you
get
back
so
soon
i
have
never
been
away
anywhere
to
get
back
from
and
you
know
it
i
replied
coldly
strange
he
said
i
could
have
sworn
that
i
saw
you
checking
out
can
i
get
you
some
ice
cream
he
added
smoothly
what
on
i
replied
bitterly
knowing
him
always
to
be
broke
your
mother
must
have
come
said
i
to
polly
leave
this
degraded
creature
to
ply
his
pernicious
trade
alone
i
have
some
very
important
words
to
say
to
you
savanrola
said
polly
until
we
meet
again
answered
the
reporter
with
the
utmost
confidence
it
all
arranged
those
words
i
had
to
say
to
polly
were
not
spoken
in
vain
she
has
promised
to
be
my
permanent
sweetie
of
course
i
have
had
a
number
of
transit
sweeties
in
the
past
but
now
i
going
to
settle
down
to
one
steady
day
in
and
day
out
sweetie
i
told
tim
the
barkeep
about
it
last
night
and
all
he
said
was
what
about
all
those
parties
we
planned
to
have
after
we
were
paid
off
this
sort
of
set
me
back
for
the
moment
the
spell
of
polly
eyes
had
made
me
forget
all
about
tim
well
tim
i
replied
i
have
to
think
about
that
come
on
over
to
the
canteen
and
i
feed
you
some
of
those
honest
upstanding
sandwiches
they
have
over
there
say
says
tim
the
carnal
beast
forgetting
everything
at
the
prospect
of
food
i
feel
as
if
i
could
cover
a
flock
of
them
without
trying
so
together
tim
and
i
had
a
bachelor
dinner
over
the
sandwiches
which
were
worthy
of
that
auspicious
occasion
we
were
standing
on
a
street
corner
of
a
neighboring
town
the
party
consisted
of
tim
the
barkeep
the
spider
an
individual
who
modestly
acknowledged
credit
for
having
brought
relief
to
several
safes
in
the
good
old
civilian
days
tony
who
delivered
ice
in
my
district
also
in
those
aforementioned
days
and
myself
these
gentlemen
for
some
time
had
been
allowing
me
to
exist
in
peace
and
i
had
been
showing
my
gratitude
by
buying
them
whatever
little
dainties
they
desired
but
such
a
comfortable
state
of
affairs
could
not
long
continue
with
that
bunch
suddenly
without
any
previous
consultation
as
if
drawn
together
as
it
were
by
some
fiendish
undercurrent
they
decided
to
make
me
unhappy
me
the
only
guy
that
spoke
unbroken
english
in
the
crowd
this
is
the
way
they
accomplished
their
low
ends
when
the
next
civilian
came
along
they
all
of
them
shouted
at
me
in
tones
that
could
be
heard
by
all
here
comes
a
buddy
he
give
you
a
quarter
do
you
need
some
money
my
boy
said
the
old
gentleman
to
me
in
a
kindly
voice
no
sir
i
stammered
getting
red
all
over
thank
you
very
much
but
i
really
do
need
any
money
ironical
laughter
from
my
friends
in
the
background
oh
no
cries
tim
sarcastically
he
do
need
no
money
just
watch
him
when
he
sees
the
color
of
it
do
hesitate
my
son
continued
the
kind
old
man
if
you
need
anything
i
would
be
glad
to
help
you
out
no
sir
i
replied
turning
away
to
hide
my
mortification
everything
is
all
right
poor
but
proud
hisses
the
spider
the
old
gentleman
passed
on
sorely
perplexed
for
some
time
i
was
a
victim
of
this
crude
plot
when
i
tried
to
move
away
they
followed
me
around
the
streets
crying
after
me
any
will
give
you
a
quarter
go
on
an
ask
them
several
ladies
stopped
and
asked
if
they
could
be
of
any
service
to
me
i
assured
them
that
they
could
but
all
the
time
these
low
sailors
whom
i
had
been
feeding
lavishly
kept
jeering
and
intimating
that
i
was
fooling
and
would
take
any
amount
of
money
offered
me
from
a
dime
up
this
shower
of
conflicting
statements
always
left
the
kindhearted
people
in
a
confused
frame
of
mind
and
broke
me
up
completely
i
had
to
chase
one
man
all
the
way
down
the
street
and
hand
him
back
the
quarter
he
had
thrust
into
my
hand
my
friends
never
forgave
me
for
this
at
length
tiring
of
their
sport
they
desisted
and
stood
gloomily
on
the
curb
as
sailors
do
looking
idly
at
nothing
it
do
look
like
we
was
ever
going
to
get
a
hitch
said
the
spider
after
we
had
abandonedly
offered
ourselves
to
several
automobiles
at
that
moment
a
huge
machine
rolled
heavily
by
there
goes
a
piece
of
junk
said
tim
the
lady
in
the
machine
must
have
heard
him
for
the
car
came
to
and
she
motioned
for
us
to
get
in
going
our
way
she
asked
smiling
at
us
thanks
lady
replies
tim
elbowing
me
aside
as
he
climbed
aboard
dust
your
feet
i
whispered
to
tony
as
he
was
about
to
climb
in
whatta
you
mean
dusta
my
feet
shouted
tony
wrathfully
you
go
head
an
dusta
your
feet
i
look
out
for
my
feet
all
right
what
did
he
want
yer
to
do
tony
asked
tim
in
a
loud
voice
dusta
my
feet
answered
tony
greatly
injured
what
yer
doin
oswald
asks
tim
sarcastically
tryin
to
drag
us
up
i
only
spoke
for
the
best
i
answered
sick
at
heart
ha
ha
grated
tim
guess
you
think
we
ai
never
rode
in
one
of
these
wealthy
wagons
before
ar
you
rather
young
asked
the
lady
soothingly
of
the
spider
who
by
virtue
of
his
mechanical
experience
in
civil
life
had
been
given
a
first
class
rating
ar
you
rather
young
to
have
so
many
things
on
your
arm
yes
answered
the
spider
promptly
but
i
kin
do
a
lot
of
tricks
the
conversation
languished
from
this
point
we
always
take
our
boys
to
dinner
do
we
dear
said
the
lady
to
her
husband
a
little
later
yes
dear
he
answered
meekly
just
like
that
expectant
silence
from
the
four
of
us
have
you
boys
had
dinner
the
lady
asked
certainly
not
we
cried
with
an
earnestness
that
gave
the
lie
to
our
statement
no
dinner
none
at
all
added
tim
thoughtfully
the
automobile
drew
up
at
a
house
that
fairly
made
the
spider
itch
gosh
he
whispered
to
me
looking
at
the
porch
that
would
be
hard
for
me
during
the
dinner
he
kept
sort
of
lifting
and
weighing
the
silver
and
then
looking
at
me
and
winking
in
an
obvious
manner
not
many
people
here
said
tony
from
behind
his
plate
why
there
is
the
usual
number
said
the
husband
in
surprise
my
wife
and
myself
live
alone
oh
said
tony
looking
around
at
the
tremendous
dining
hall
i
thought
this
was
a
restaurant
illustration
said
tony
thought
this
was
a
restaurant
tim
started
laughing
then
and
he
has
stopped
yet
he
so
proud
he
did
make
the
mistake
himself
the
spider
did
open
his
mouth
save
for
the
purpose
of
eating
he
told
me
he
was
afraid
his
teeth
would
chatter
got
a
letter
from
polly
she
says
that
her
finger
is
just
itching
for
the
ring
i
told
the
spider
about
it
and
he
said
that
he
had
several
unset
stones
he
let
me
have
for
next
to
nothing
a
good
burglar
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
friends
a
man
can
possess
i
had
such
a
never
was
i
more
confounded
this
morning
i
received
a
notice
to
report
before
the
examining
board
for
a
first
class
rating
of
course
i
had
been
expecting
some
slight
recognition
of
my
real
worth
for
a
long
time
but
when
the
blow
fell
i
was
hardly
prepared
for
it
hurrying
to
my
blue
jacket
manual
i
succeeded
by
the
aid
of
a
picture
in
getting
firmly
in
my
mind
the
port
and
starboard
side
of
a
ship
and
then
i
presented
myself
before
the
examiners
three
doughty
and
unsmiling
officers
there
were
about
twelve
of
us
up
for
examination
seating
ourselves
before
the
three
gentlemen
we
gazed
upon
them
with
trepidation
one
of
them
called
the
roll
in
a
languid
manner
and
then
without
further
preliminaries
the
battle
began
and
i
received
the
first
shock
of
the
assault
i
do
quite
remember
the
question
that
man
asked
me
it
was
all
too
ghastly
at
the
time
but
i
think
it
was
something
like
this
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
at
the
wheel
in
a
dense
fog
and
you
heard
three
whistles
on
your
port
beam
four
whistles
off
the
starboard
bow
and
a
prolonged
toot
dead
ahead
i
would
still
remain
in
a
dense
fog
i
gasped
in
a
low
voice
speak
up
snapped
the
officer
full
speed
ahead
and
jumps
whispered
a
guy
next
to
me
it
sounded
reasonable
i
seized
upon
it
eagerly
i
put
full
steam
ahead
and
jump
sir
i
replied
are
you
mad
shouted
the
amazed
officer
no
sir
i
hastened
to
assure
him
only
profoundly
perplexed
i
think
sir
that
i
would
go
into
a
conference
under
the
circumstances
the
officer
seemed
to
be
on
the
verge
of
a
breakdown
what
your
name
asked
another
officer
suddenly
i
told
him
initials
i
told
him
he
looked
at
the
paper
for
a
moment
that
explains
it
he
said
with
a
sigh
of
relief
you
not
the
man
there
has
been
some
mistake
orderly
take
this
man
away
and
bring
back
the
right
one
pronto
that
spanish
stuff
sounds
awfully
i
was
taken
away
but
the
officer
had
not
yet
recovered
he
regarded
me
with
an
expression
of
profound
disgust
anyway
i
created
a
sensation
illustration
would
still
remain
in
a
dense
fog
i
gasped
in
a
low
voice
things
have
been
happening
with
overwhelming
rapidity
on
the
strength
of
being
properly
engaged
to
polly
my
permanent
sweetie
i
went
to
my
regimental
commander
this
morning
and
applied
for
a
furlough
he
regarded
me
pityingly
for
a
moment
and
then
carefully
scanned
a
list
of
names
on
the
desk
before
him
i
am
sorry
he
said
finally
but
not
only
am
i
not
able
to
grant
your
request
but
i
have
the
unpleasant
duty
to
inform
you
that
you
are
a
little
less
than
hours
from
the
vicinity
of
ambrose
light
shipped
i
gasped
as
the
world
swam
around
me
your
name
is
on
this
list
said
the
officer
not
unkindly
shipped
i
repeated
in
a
dazed
voice
it
does
seem
ridiculous
i
admit
said
the
officer
smiling
but
you
never
can
tell
what
strange
things
are
going
to
happen
in
the
navy
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
take
advantage
of
this
head
start
i
have
given
you
and
get
my
clothes
and
in
some
sort
of
condition
if
i
remember
rightly
you
have
never
been
able
successfully
to
achieve
this
since
you
been
in
the
service
thank
you
sir
i
gasped
and
bolted
in
my
excitement
i
ran
violently
into
a
flock
of
ensigns
stalking
across
the
parade
ground
i
going
to
be
shipped
i
cried
by
way
of
explanation
to
one
of
them
as
he
arose
wrathfully
you
going
to
be
damned
said
he
and
i
was
too
frantic
to
write
more
all
preparations
have
been
made
tim
tony
and
the
spider
are
going
too
i
have
just
been
listening
to
the
most
disturbing
conversation
it
all
arose
from
our
speculating
as
to
our
probable
destination
and
the
nature
of
our
services
the
who
had
been
sleeping
on
the
hammock
rack
as
only
a
can
permitted
himself
to
remain
awake
long
enough
to
join
in
i
would
be
at
all
surprised
said
he
if
you
were
shipped
to
one
of
these
new
submarine
provokers
what
that
i
asked
uneasily
why
it
a
sort
of
a
said
he
stretching
his
huge
hulk
a
little
unarmed
boat
that
goes
messing
around
in
the
ocean
until
it
finds
a
submarine
and
then
it
provokes
it
how
that
asked
tim
why
you
see
continued
the
it
just
sort
of
steams
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
submarine
just
steams
slowly
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
submarine
until
it
provokes
it
ah
said
i
taking
a
deep
breath
yes
he
continues
cheerfully
and
the
more
you
provoked
the
submarine
why
the
harder
it
shoots
at
you
so
of
course
it
notice
the
real
submarine
sinker
coming
up
behind
it
see
the
tactics
oh
says
i
we
just
provoke
the
submarine
until
it
loses
its
temper
and
the
other
boat
sinks
it
that
it
says
the
you
just
sort
of
steam
back
and
forth
in
front
of
it
slowly
how
slowly
asks
the
spider
very
replied
the
no
guns
at
all
asks
tim
none
says
he
a
regular
little
home
suggests
tony
sure
says
the
nothing
to
do
at
all
but
steam
slowly
back
for
god
sake
do
dwell
on
that
point
any
more
i
cried
we
understand
it
perfectly
a
regular
lil
home
muttered
tim
as
he
began
to
stow
his
bag
later
i
write
these
lines
with
horror
some
one
has
told
me
that
the
navy
needs
powder
tasters
something
i
never
heard
of
before
and
that
perhaps
that
what
we
are
going
to
be
used
for
all
you
have
to
do
this
guy
says
is
to
taste
the
powder
to
see
if
it
damp
or
dry
and
if
it
damp
you
take
it
away
and
bake
it
this
sounds
worse
than
the
submarine
provoker
still
later
rumor
is
rife
the
latest
report
is
that
we
are
going
to
be
mine
openers
what
a
mine
opener
i
asked
my
informant
why
it
a
guy
says
he
that
picks
up
the
mines
floating
around
his
boat
but
only
the
german
mines
of
course
and
opens
them
to
see
if
they
are
as
dangerous
as
they
look
some
are
not
half
as
dangerous
as
they
look
he
continues
easily
some
are
not
quite
so
dangerous
and
of
course
some
are
a
great
deal
more
so
but
they
are
all
dangerous
enough
my
dear
chap
i
replied
turning
away
miserably
a
pinwheel
is
quite
dangerous
enough
for
me
this
is
being
written
from
the
gate
my
bag
and
hammock
are
beside
me
tim
lashed
them
together
for
me
so
they
would
come
undone
we
are
waiting
for
the
truck
tony
in
his
excitable
way
wants
to
kiss
the
guard
the
guard
does
want
him
to
my
last
moments
at
pelham
have
been
hectic
the
doctor
said
i
looked
one
hundred
per
cent
better
than
when
i
came
in
but
that
was
enough
if
you
did
look
at
me
very
closely
you
would
know
that
i
was
such
an
awful
dub
this
is
progress
at
any
rate
the
telephone
wires
between
mother
house
and
the
camp
were
dripping
wet
with
tears
when
i
phoned
her
that
i
was
being
shipped
however
she
braced
up
and
said
she
was
proud
of
me
and
said
she
hoped
i
tell
the
captain
and
thank
him
for
all
he
has
done
i
assured
her
i
would
do
this
or
at
least
leave
a
note
polly
was
a
trump
the
spider
talked
to
her
and
said
that
he
was
going
to
save
the
best
uncut
stone
for
her
that
he
had
ever
bitten
out
of
a
ring
the
spider
has
been
very
valuable
to
us
all
he
seems
to
have
the
uncanny
faculty
of
being
able
to
take
the
cloth
straps
off
other
people
clothes
right
before
their
eyes
consequently
we
are
well
supplied
at
present
he
looking
at
the
handle
of
the
gate
in
a
musing
way
i
think
he
would
like
to
have
it
as
a
souvenir
here
comes
the
truck
pelham
is
about
to
lose
its
most
useless
recruit
i
must
tuck
these
priceless
pages
in
my
money
belt
wish
i
had
a
picture
of
polly
well
here
to
the
high
adventure
but
there
something
about
that
submarine
provoker
i
ca
quite
get
used
to
it
seems
just
a
trifle
one
sided
however
that
is
in
the
lap
of
the
gods
instead
of
a
camp
i
will
soon
have
the
vast
expanses
of
the
ocean
in
which
to
demonstrate
my
tremendous
inability
to
emulate
the
example
of
one
john
paul
jones
bear
a
hand
there
buddy
the
has
just
cried
at
me
buddy

came
in
and
buddy

can
dimly
distinguish

unscrupulous
dog

of
influential
yeomen

your
evil
ways
never
bring
you
to
