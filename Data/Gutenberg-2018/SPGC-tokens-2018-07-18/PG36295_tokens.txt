asked

dremmel
turning
her
pebble
eyes
slowly
from
one
to
the

especially
her
gaze
lingered
on
her
feet
becoming
aware
of
this
ingeborg
tried
to
hide
them
but
these
are
very
wonderful
she
said
taking
up
the
sketches
i
wish
i
were
really
like
that
part
i
chapter
i
on
that
april
afternoon
all
the
wallflowers
of
the
world
seemed
to
her
released
body
to
have
been
piled
up
at
the
top
of
regent
street
so
that
she
should
walk
in
fragrance
she
was
in
this
exalted
mood
the
little
young
lady
slipping
along
southwards
from
harley
street
because
she
had
just
had
a
tooth
out
after
weeks
of
miserable
indifference
she
was
quivering
with
responsiveness
again
feeling
the
relish
of
life
the
tang
of
it
the
jollity
of
all
this
bustle
and
hurrying
past
of
busy
people
and
the
beauty
of
it
the
of
it
she
thought
fighting
a
tendency
to
loiter
in
the
middle
of
the
traffic
to
have
a
good
look
the
beauty
of
the
sky
across
the
roofs
of
the
houses
the
delicacy
of
the
mistiness
that
hung
down
there
over
the
curve
of
the
street
the
loveliness
of
the
lights
beginning
to
shine
in
the
shop
windows
surely
the
colour
of
london
was
an
exquisite
thing
it
was
like
a
pearl
that
late
afternoon
something
very
gentle
and
pale
with
faint
blue
shadows
and
as
for
its
smell
she
doubted
indeed
whether
heaven
itself
could
smell
better
certainly
not
so
interesting
and
anyhow
she
said
to
herself
lifting
her
head
a
moment
in
appreciation
it
ca
possibly
smell
more
she
herself
had
certainly
never
been
more
alive
she
felt
electric
she
would
not
have
been
surprised
if
sparks
had
come
crackling
out
of
the
tips
of
her
sober
gloves
not
only
was
she
suddenly
and
incredibly
relieved
from
acute
pain
but
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
of
years
she
was
alone
this
by
itself
without
the
business
of
the
tooth
was
enough
to
make
a
dutiful
willing
and
hardworked
daughter
tingle
she
would
have
tingled
if
by
some
glorious
chance
a
whole
free
day
had
come
to
her
merely
inside
the
grey
walls
of
the
garden
at
home
but
to
be
free
and
idle
in
london
to
have
them
all
so
far
away
her
family
down
there
in
the
west
to
have
them
so
necessarily
silent
so
oddly
vague
already
and
pallid
in
the
distance
yet
she
had
only
left
them
that
morning
it
was
only
nine
hours
since
her
father
handsome
as
an
archangel
silvery
of
head
and
gaitered
of
leg
had
waved
her
off
from
the
doorstep
with
offended
resignation
and
do
not
return
ingeborg
he
had
called
into
the
fly
where
she
sat
holding
her
face
and
trying
not
to
rock
till
you
are
completely
set
right
even
a
week
even
ten
days
have
them
all
seen
to
for
the
collapse
of
ingeborg
daunted
into
just
a
silent
feverish
thing
of
pain
had
convulsed
the
ordered
life
at
home
her
family
bore
it
for
a
week
with
perfect
manners
and
hardly
a
look
of
reproach
then
they
sent
her
to
the
redchester
dentist
a
hitherto
sufficient
man
who
tortured
her
with
tentative
stoppings
and
turned
what
had
been
dull
and
smooth
into
excitement
and
jerks
then
unable
to
resist
a
feeling
that
would
have
greatly
helped
it
began
to
find
the
etiquette
of
christian
behaviour
which
insisted
on
its
going
on
being
silent
while
she
more
and
more
let
herself
go
irksome
the
bishop
wanted
things
in
vain
three
times
he
had
to
see
himself
off
alone
at
the
station
and
not
be
met
when
he
came
back
buttons
because
they
were
not
tightened
on
in
time
burst
from
his
gaiters
and
did
it
in
remote
places
like
railway
carriages
letters
were
unanswered
important
ones
engagements
vital
ones
through
lack
of
reminders
went
unkept
at
last
it
became
plain
when
she
seemed
not
even
to
wish
to
answer
when
spoken
to
or
to
move
when
called
that
this
apathy
and
creeping
away
to
hide
could
not
further
be
endured
against
all
tradition
against
every
home
principle
they
let
a
young
unmarried
daughter
loose
with
offended
reluctance
they
sent
her
to
london
to
a
celebrity
in
teeth
after
all
it
was
not
as
if
she
had
been
going
just
to
enjoy
herself
and
your
aunt
will
please
forgive
us
said
the
bishop
for
taking
her
in
this
manner
unawares
the
aunt
a
serious
strong
lady
was
engaged
for
political
meetings
in
the
north
and
had
gone
away
to
them
that
very
morning
leaving
a
letter
and
her
house
at
ingeborg
disposal
for
so
long
as
the
dentist
needed
her
the
dentist
being
the
best
that
money
could
buy
hardly
needed
her
at
all
he
pounced
unerringly
and
at
once
on
the
right
tooth
and
pulled
it
out
there
were
no
stoppings
no
delays
no
pain
and
no
aunt
never
was
a
life
more
beautifully
cleared
ingeborg
went
away
down
harley
street
free
and
with
ten
pounds
in
her
pocket
for
the
rest
of
this
one
day
for
an
hour
or
two
morning
before
setting
out
for
paddington
and
home
she
could
do
exactly
as
she
liked
why
there
nothing
to
prevent
me
going
this
evening
she
thought
stopping
dead
as
the
full
glory
of
the
situation
slowly
dawned
on
her
why
i
could
go
out
somewhere
really
grand
to
dinner
just
as
people
do
i
expect
in
all
the
books
i
not
let
read
and
then
i
could
go
to
the
play
nobody
could
prevent
me
why
i
could
go
to
a
if
i
chose
and
nobody
could
prevent
me
audacious
imaginings
that
made
her
laugh
she
had
not
laughed
for
weeks
darted
in
and
out
of
her
busy
brain
she
saw
herself
in
her
dress
reducing
waiters
in
marble
and
gilt
places
to
respect
and
slavery
by
showing
them
her
ten
pounds
she
built
up
lurid
fabrics
of
possible
daring
deeds
and
smiled
at
the
reflection
of
herself
in
shop
windows
as
she
passed
at
the
sobriety
the
irreproachableness
of
the
sheath
containing
these
molten
imaginings
why
she
might
hire
a
car
just
telephone
and
there
you
were
with
it
round
in
five
minutes
and
go
off
in
the
twilight
to
richmond
park
or
windsor
she
had
never
been
to
richmond
park
or
windsor
she
had
never
been
anywhere
but
she
was
sure
there
would
be
bats
and
stars
out
there
and
water
and
the
soft
duskiness
of
trees
and
the
smell
of
wet
earth
and
she
could
drive
about
them
a
little
slowly
so
as
to
it
all
and
then
come
back
and
have
supper
somewhere
have
supper
at
the
ritz
she
thought
of
which
she
had
read
hastily
out
of
the
corner
of
an
eye
between
two
appearances
of
the
bishop
in
the
more
interesting
portions
of
the
just
saunter
in
you
know
or
she
could
have
dinner
first
yes
dinner
first
dinner
at
claridge
no
not
at
claridge
she
had
an
aunt
who
stayed
there
another
one
her
mother
sister
rich
and
powerful
and
it
was
always
best
not
to
stir
up
rich
and
powerful
aunts
dinner
at
the
thackeray
hôtel
perhaps
that
was
where
her
father
relations
stayed
serious
men
who
once
were
curates
and
yet
earlier
good
and
handsome
babies
it
was
near
the
british
museum
she
had
heard
its
name
and
surroundings
suggested
magnificence
of
a
nobler
sort
than
the
ritz
yes
she
would
dine
at
the
thackeray
hôtel
and
be
splendid
here
coming
to
a
window
full
of
food
she
became
aware
that
wonderfully
and
for
the
first
time
for
weeks
she
was
hungry
so
hungry
that
she
did
want
dinner
or
supper
or
anything
future
but
something
now
she
went
in
and
all
her
gilded
visions
of
the
ritz
and
the
thackeray
hôtel
were
swamped
in
one
huge
cup
she
felt
how
legitimate
and
appropriate
a
drink
it
was
for
a
bishop
daughter
without
a
chaperon
and
ordered
the
biggest
size
costing
of
aerated
bread
shop
cocoa
it
was
six
when
she
emerged
amazingly
nourished
from
that
strange
place
where
elderly
men
with
tired
eyes
were
hurriedly
eating
poached
eggs
on
chilly
little
clothless
marble
tables
and
continued
down
regent
street
she
now
felt
strangely
settled
in
her
mind
she
no
longer
wanted
to
go
to
the
ritz
indeed
the
notion
of
dining
anywhere
with
the
cocoa
clothing
her
internally
as
with
a
garment
a
thick
winter
garment
almost
she
thought
like
the
closer
kinds
of
fur
was
revolting
she
still
felt
enterprising
but
a
little
clogged
she
thought
now
more
of
things
like
fresh
air
and
exercise
not
now
for
her
the
heat
and
glitter
of
a
there
was
a
taste
in
that
pure
drink
that
was
irreconcilable
with
a
satisfying
property
in
its
unadulteratedness
its
careful
cleanliness
that
reminded
her
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
bishop
walking
away
from
the
aerated
bread
shop
rather
gravely
she
remembered
that
she
had
a
mother
on
a
sofa
an
only
sister
who
was
so
beautiful
that
it
was
touching
and
a
class
of
boys
once
unruly
and
now
looking
up
to
her
in
fact
that
she
had
a
position
to
keep
up
she
was
still
happy
but
happy
now
in
a
thoroughly
nice
way
and
she
would
probably
have
gone
back
in
this
warmed
and
solaced
condition
to
her
aunt
house
in
bedford
square
and
an
evening
with
a
book
and
an
early
bed
if
her
eye
had
not
been
caught
by
a
poster
outside
an
office
sort
of
place
she
was
passing
a
picture
of
water
and
mountains
with
written
on
it
in
big
letters
a
week
in
lovely
lucerne
seven
days
for
seven
guineas
those
who
intend
to
join
next
trip
inquire
within
now
ingeborg
maternal
grandmother
had
been
a
swede
a
creature
of
toughness
and
skill
on
skis
a
young
woman
when
caught
surprisingly
by
the
english
tourist
ingeborg
grandfather
drenched
in
frank
reading
and
thinking
and
in
the
smell
of
the
abounding
forests
and
in
wood
strawberries
and
sour
cream
she
had
lived
up
to
the
day
when
for
some
quite
undiscoverable
reason
she
allowed
herself
to
be
married
to
the
narrow
stranger
in
the
middle
of
big
beautiful
things
big
stretches
of
water
big
mountains
big
winds
big
lonelinesses
and
ingeborg
who
had
never
been
out
of
england
and
had
spent
years
in
the
soft
and
soppy
west
seeing
the
picture
of
the
great
lake
and
the
great
sky
in
the
window
in
regent
street
felt
a
quick
grip
on
her
heart
it
was
the
fingers
of
her
grandmother
she
stood
staring
at
the
picture
trying
hard
to
remember
quite
something
beautiful
and
elusive
and
remote
that
once
she
had
known
oh
that
once
she
had
known
but
that
she
kept
on
somehow
forgetting
the
urgencies
of
daily
life
in
episcopal
surroundings
the
breathless
pursuit
of
her
duties
the
effort
all
day
long
to
catch
them
up
and
be
even
with
them
the
bishop
buttons
the
bishop
speeches
the
bishop
departures
by
trains
his
when
at
home
his
mass
of
correspondence
when
away
she
is
my
right
hand
he
would
say
in
stately
praise
the
redchester
to
which
her
mother
could
go
because
of
the
sofa
the
county
to
which
judith
had
to
be
taken
the
callers
the
bazaars
the
cathedral
services
the
hurry
the
noise
life
at
home
seemed
the
noisiest
thing
these
had
smothered
and
hidden
beaten
down
put
out
and
silenced
that
highly
important
and
unrecognized
part
of
her
her
little
bit
of
lurking
grandmother
now
however
this
tough
but
impulsive
lady
rose
within
her
in
all
her
might
her
granddaughter
was
in
exactly
the
right
state
for
being
influenced
she
was
standing
there
staring
longing
seething
with
scandinavia
and
presently
arguing
why
should
she
the
bishop
as
she
had
remarked
with
wonder
earlier
in
the
afternoon
seemed
to
have
faded
quite
pallid
that
long
way
off
and
arrangements
had
been
made
he
had
engaged
an
extra
secretary
his
chaplain
had
been
warned
judith
was
going
perhaps
to
do
something
her
mother
would
stay
safely
on
the
sofa
they
did
not
expect
her
back
for
at
least
a
week
and
not
for
as
much
longer
as
her
tooth
might
ache
if
her
tooth
were
still
in
her
mouth
it
be
aching
if
the
dentist
had
decided
to
stop
it
it
would
have
been
a
fortnight
before
such
a
dreadful
ache
as
that
could
be
suppressed
she
was
sure
it
would
and
the
ten
pounds
her
father
had
given
her
for
taxis
and
tips
and
other
odds
and
ends
spread
over
a
fortnight
what
would
have
been
left
of
it
anyhow
besides
he
had
said
and
indeed
the
bishop
desirous
of
taking
no
jot
from
his
generosity
in
the
whole
annoying
business
had
said
it
and
said
it
with
the
strong
flavour
of
scripture
which
hung
about
even
his
mufti
utterances
that
she
might
keep
any
fragments
of
it
that
remained
that
nothing
be
lost
your
father
is
very
good
to
you
said
her
mother
in
whose
prostrate
presence
the
gift
had
been
but
bishops
flashed
across
ingeborg
undisciplined
and
jerky
mind
have
to
be
good
she
caught
the
flash
however
and
choked
it
out
before
it
had
got
you
be
able
to
get
yourself
a
spring
hat
yes
mother
said
ingeborg
holding
her
face
and
i
should
think
a
blouse
as
well
said
her
mother
thoughtfully
yes
mother
my
dear
remember
i
ingeborg
here
said
the
bishop
uneasy
at
this
vision
of
an
indispensable
daughter
delayed
by
blouses
you
will
not
of
course
forget
that
ingeborg
no
father
and
here
she
was
forgetting
it
here
she
was
in
front
of
a
common
poster
forgetting
it
what
the
ritz
and
the
thackeray
hôtel
with
all
their
attractions
had
not
been
able
to
do
that
crude
picture
did
she
forgot
the
bishop
or
rather
he
seemed
at
that
distance
such
a
little
thing
such
a
little
bit
of
a
thing
a
tiny
little
black
figure
with
a
dab
of
white
on
its
top
compared
to
this
vision
of
splendid
earth
and
heaven
that
she
wilfully
would
not
remember
him
she
forgot
her
accumulating
work
she
forgot
that
her
movements
had
all
first
to
be
sanctioned
a
whirl
of
scandinavianism
of
violent
longing
for
freedom
and
adventure
seemed
to
catch
her
and
lift
her
out
of
the
street
and
fling
her
into
a
place
of
maps
and
and
helpful
young
men
framed
in
mahogany
when
when
she
stammered
breathlessly
pointing
to
a
duplicate
of
the
same
poster
hanging
inside
when
does
the
next
trip
start
madam
said
the
young
man
her
question
had
tumbled
on
a
solemnity
fell
upon
her
she
felt
it
was
providence
she
ceased
to
argue
she
did
even
try
to
struggle
i
going
she
announced
and
her
ten
pounds
became
two
pounds
thirteen
and
she
walked
away
conscious
of
nothing
except
that
the
very
next
day
she
would
be
off
chapter
ii
she
was
collected
by
the
official
leader
of
this
particular
excursion
at
charing
cross
the
next
morning
and
swept
into
a
carriage
with
nine
other
excursionists
and
next
door
there
were
more
she
counted
eighteen
of
them
at
one
time
crowding
round
the
leader
asking
him
questions
and
besides
these
there
was
a
crowd
of
ordinary
passengers
bustling
about
with
holiday
expressions
and
several
runaway
couples
and
every
single
person
seemed
like
herself
eager
to
be
off
the
runaway
couples
from
the
ravaged
expressions
on
their
faces
were
being
torn
by
doubts
perhaps
already
by
repentances
but
ingeborg
though
she
was
deceiving
her
father
who
being
a
bishop
should
have
been
peculiarly
inviolate
and
her
mother
who
being
should
have
appealed
to
her
better
nature
and
her
sister
who
being
exquisite
should
have
been
guarded
from
any
shadow
that
might
dim
her
beauty
had
none
she
had
been
frightened
that
morning
while
she
was
packing
and
getting
herself
out
of
her
aunt
house
the
immense
conviction
of
the
servants
that
she
was
going
home
cowed
her
and
she
had
had
to
say
little
things
paddington
for
instance
to
the
taxi
driver
when
she
knew
she
meant
charing
cross
and
had
blushed
when
she
changed
it
through
the
window
but
here
she
was
and
there
was
a
crowd
of
people
doing
exactly
the
same
thing
whose
secure
jollity
except
in
the
case
of
those
odd
sad
couples
was
contagious
and
she
felt
both
safe
and
as
though
she
were
the
most
normal
creature
in
the
world
what
she
thought
her
blood
dancing
as
she
watched
the
swarming
surging
platform
what
often
had
she
been
at
the
redchester
station
in
attendance
on
her
departing
father
but
what
a
getting
off
was
that
compared
with
this
hilarity
there
was
bustle
of
course
because
trains
wo
wait
and
people
wo
get
out
of
the
way
but
the
bishop
bustlings
particularly
when
their
end
was
confirmations
were
conducted
with
a
kind
of
frozen
offendedness
there
was
no
life
in
him
she
thought
remembering
them
he
did
let
himself
go
on
the
other
hand
she
reflected
careful
to
be
fair
you
could
snatch
illicitly
at
things
like
confirmations
in
the
way
you
could
at
a
dent
tour
and
devour
them
in
secret
with
a
fearful
hidden
joy
she
felt
like
a
bulb
must
feel
she
thought
at
the
supreme
moment
when
it
has
nosed
its
little
spear
successfully
up
through
the
mould
it
has
endured
all
the
winter
and
gets
it
suddenly
out
into
the
light
and
splendour
of
the
world
the
freedom
of
it
the
joy
of
getting
the
excursionists
in
the
carriage
struggled
to
reach
the
window
across
her
feet
and
say
things
to
their
friends
outside
they
all
talked
at
once
and
the
carriage
was
full
of
sound
and
gesticulations
the
friends
on
the
platform
could
not
hear
but
they
nodded
and
smiled
sympathetically
and
shouted
at
intervals
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
good
crossing
everybody
was
being
seen
off
except
herself
and
the
runaway
couples
indeed
you
could
know
which
those
were
by
the
gaps
along
the
platform
she
sat
well
back
in
her
place
anxious
to
make
herself
as
convenient
as
possible
and
to
get
her
feet
tucked
out
of
the
way
a
typical
daughter
of
provincial
england
and
a
careful
home
and
the
more
expensive
clergy
inconspicuous
and
grey
her
soft
hat
as
the
fashion
that
spring
still
went
on
decreeing
in
the
west
came
down
well
over
her
eyes
and
ears
and
little
rings
of
cheerful
hair
of
a
scandinavian
colouring
wantoned
beneath
it
her
small
face
was
swallowed
up
in
the
shadow
of
the
hat
you
saw
a
liberal
mouth
with
happy
corners
and
the
nostrils
of
a
selective
nose
and
there
was
an
impression
of
freckles
and
of
a
very
fair
sunny
sort
of
skin
the
square
german
gentleman
opposite
her
knowing
nobody
in
london
and
therefore
being
but
for
a
different
and
honourable
reason
in
her
position
of
not
having
any
one
to
see
him
off
filled
up
the
time
by
staring
entirely
unconscious
that
it
might
be
embarrassing
he
sat
and
stared
with
the
utmost
singleness
of
mind
he
wished
to
see
the
rest
of
her
when
he
would
be
able
to
determine
whether
she
were
pretty
or
not
ingeborg
absorbed
by
the
wild
excitement
on
the
platform
had
not
noticed
him
but
immediately
the
train
started
and
the
other
passengers
had
sorted
themselves
into
their
seats
and
were
beginning
the
furtive
watchfulness
of
one
another
that
was
presently
to
resolve
itself
into
acquaintanceship
she
knew
there
was
something
large
and
steady
opposite
that
was
concentrated
upon
herself
she
looked
up
quickly
to
see
what
it
was
and
for
a
moment
her
polite
intelligent
eyes
returned
his
stare
he
decided
that
she
had
missed
being
pretty
and
with
a
faint
regret
wondered
what
god
was
about
fattened
up
yes
possibly
he
thought
fattened
up
yes
perhaps
and
he
went
on
staring
because
she
happened
to
be
exactly
opposite
and
there
was
nothing
else
except
tunnels
to
look
at
the
other
excursionists
were
all
in
pairs
they
thought
ingeborg
was
too
and
put
her
down
at
first
as
the
german
gentleman
wife
because
he
did
not
speak
to
her
there
were
two
couples
of
young
women
one
of
ladies
of
a
riper
age
and
one
of
earnest
young
men
who
were
mentioning
balzac
to
each
other
almost
before
they
had
got
to
new
cross
indeed
a
surprising
atmosphere
of
culture
pervaded
the
compartment
ingeborg
was
astonished
except
the
riper
ladies
who
persisted
in
talking
about
shoolbred
they
were
all
presently
saying
educated
things
balzac
blake
bernard
shaw
and
florence
barclay
were
bandied
backwards
and
forwards
across
the
carriage
as
lightly
and
familiarly
as
though
they
had
been
balls
in
the
far
corner
browning
was
being
compared
with
tennyson
in
the
middle
dickens
with
thackeray
the
two
elder
ladies
who
kept
to
shoolbred
formed
a
sort
of
dam
between
these
educated
overflowings
and
the
silent
in
which
ingeborg
and
the
german
gentleman
sat
becalmed
presently
owing
to
a
politeness
that
could
not
allow
even
an
outlying
portion
of
any
one
else
clothing
or
belongings
to
be
brushed
against
without
excuse
me
having
been
said
and
mention
it
having
been
answered
acquaintanceships
were
made
chocolates
were
offered
they
introduced
each
other
to
each
other
for
a
brief
space
the
young
men
caps
were
hardly
on
their
heads
and
the
air
was
murmurous
with
gratified
noises
but
the
two
riper
ladies
passionately
preoccupied
by
shoolbred
continued
to
dam
up
ingeborg
and
her
opposite
neighbour
into
a
stagnant
and
unfruitful
isolation
she
tried
to
peep
round
the
lady
next
to
her
who
jutted
out
like
a
mountain
with
mighty
boulders
on
it
so
as
to
see
the
three
people
hidden
in
the
valley
beyond
glimpses
of
their
knees
revealed
that
they
were
just
like
the
ones
on
the
seat
opposite
they
were
neat
knees
a
little
threadbare
not
with
the
delicate
threadbareness
of
her
own
home
in
the
palace
at
redchester
where
splendours
of
carved
stone
and
black
oak
and
ancient
glass
were
kept
from
flaunting
their
pricelessness
too
obviously
in
the
faces
of
the
local
supporters
of
disestablishment
by
a
christian
leanness
in
the
matter
of
carpets
but
knees
that
were
inexpensive
because
they
had
to
be
who
were
these
girls
and
young
men
and
the
two
abundant
ladies
and
the
man
with
the
vast
thick
head
and
unalterable
stare
all
people
who
did
things
she
was
certain
not
just
anything
like
herself
but
regular
things
that
began
and
stopped
at
fixed
times
that
were
paid
for
that
was
why
they
were
able
to
do
frankly
and
honourably
what
she
was
snatching
at
furtively
in
a
corner
for
a
brief
astonishing
instant
she
was
aware
she
liked
the
corner
way
staggered
at
this
for
she
could
in
no
way
reconcile
it
with
the
bishop
the
cathedral
the
home
nor
with
any
of
her
thoughts
down
there
while
enfolded
in
these
three
absorbing
influences
she
tried
to
follow
her
father
advice
and
look
into
herself
but
it
did
not
help
much
she
saw
indeed
that
she
was
doing
an
outrageous
thing
but
then
she
was
very
happy
happier
than
she
had
ever
been
in
redchester
plied
with
legitimate
episcopal
joys
there
was
a
keenness
about
this
joy
the
salt
freshness
of
something
jolly
and
indefensible
done
in
secret
she
did
look
at
penitence
sideways
for
an
instant
but
almost
at
once
decided
that
it
was
a
thing
that
comes
afterwards
first
you
do
your
thing
you
must
of
course
do
your
thing
or
there
could
be
any
penitence
she
sat
up
very
straight
her
face
lit
with
these
thoughts
that
both
amused
and
frightened
her
her
lips
slightly
parted
her
eyes
radiant
ready
for
anything
life
had
to
offer
a
little
fattened
up
thought
the
german
gentleman
a
even
would
probably
suffice
there
was
to
be
a
night
in
paris
no
time
to
see
it
but
you
ca
have
everything
and
paris
is
paris
and
next
morning
into
the
train
again
and
down
down
all
down
the
slope
of
the
map
of
france
to
bâle
the
gate
of
beauty
surely
of
heavenly
beauty
and
then
you
got
there
and
there
were
five
whole
days
of
wonder
and
then
her
thoughts
hesitated
why
then
she
supposed
making
an
effort
you
began
to
come
back
and
then
but
here
she
thought
it
wisest
not
to
go
on
thinking
excuse
me
but
do
you
mind
having
that
window
up
asked
the
lady
on
her
right
oh
no
said
ingeborg
darting
at
the
strap
with
the
readiness
to
help
and
obey
she
had
been
so
carefully
practised
in
it
was
stiff
and
she
fumbled
at
it
wondering
a
little
why
the
man
opposite
just
watched
when
she
had
got
it
up
he
undid
the
woollen
scarf
round
his
neck
and
unbuttoned
the
top
button
of
his
overcoat
at
last
he
said
in
a
voice
of
relief
heaving
an
enormous
sigh
he
looked
at
her
and
smiled
instantly
she
smiled
back
any
shreds
of
she
may
have
had
clinging
to
her
in
her
earlier
days
had
been
finally
scraped
off
when
judith
that
amazing
piece
of
loveliness
came
out
were
you
cold
she
asked
with
the
friendly
interest
of
a
boy
naturally
when
windows
are
open
one
is
always
cold
oh
said
ingeborg
who
had
never
thought
of
that
she
perceived
from
his
speech
that
he
was
a
foreigner
from
the
collar
and
white
tie
beneath
his
opened
scarf
she
also
was
made
aware
that
he
was
a
minister
of
religion
how
they
pursue
me
she
thought
even
here
even
in
a
railway
carriage
reserved
for
excursionists
only
one
of
them
had
filtered
through
she
also
saw
that
he
was
of
a
drab
complexion
and
that
his
hair
drab
too
and
and
thick
seemed
to
be
made
of
beaver
but
that
what
windows
are
she
said
after
reflecting
on
it
no
the
two
large
ladies
let
shoolbred
pause
while
they
looked
at
each
other
they
considered
ingeborg
behaviour
forward
she
ought
not
to
have
spoken
first
impossible
on
a
dent
tour
not
to
make
friends
indeed
the
social
side
of
these
excursions
is
the
most
important
but
there
are
rules
the
other
end
of
the
carriage
had
observed
the
rules
the
two
ladies
hoped
they
had
not
joined
anything
not
quite
the
other
end
had
carried
out
the
rules
with
rigid
had
accidentally
touched
and
trodden
on
had
apologised
had
had
its
apologies
accepted
had
introduced
and
been
introduced
and
so
had
cleared
the
way
to
chocolates
no
repeated
ingeborg
inquiringly
the
aperture
was
there
first
said
the
german
gentleman
of
course
said
ingeborg
seeing
he
waited
for
her
to
admit
it
and
in
the
fulness
of
the
ages
came
man
and
mechanically
shut
it
yes
said
ingeborg
but
consequently
the
function
of
windows
is
to
shut
apertures
yes
but
and
not
to
open
that
which
without
them
was
open
already
but
it
would
be
illogical
said
the
german
gentleman
patiently
to
contend
that
their
function
is
to
open
that
which
without
them
was
open
already
reassured
by
the
word
illogical
which
was
a
nice
word
well
known
to
and
quite
within
the
spirit
of
a
dent
tour
the
two
ladies
went
on
with
shoolbred
where
they
had
left
him
off
the
first
day
i
was
in
england
i
went
about
logically
and
shut
each
single
window
in
my
i
then
discovered
that
this
embittered
the
atmosphere
around
me
it
would
thicken
it
nodded
ingeborg
interested
it
did
and
my
calling
after
all
being
that
of
peace
and
my
visit
so
short
that
whatever
happened
could
be
endured
i
relinquished
logic
and
purchased
in
its
place
a
woollen
scarf
this
one
then
i
gave
myself
up
unrestrictedly
to
their
air
and
did
you
like
it
it
made
me
recollect
with
pleasure
that
i
was
soon
going
home
in
east
prussia
there
are
on
the
one
hand
drawbacks
but
on
the
other
are
double
windows
stoves
and
a
just
proportion
of
feathers
for
each
bed
till
the
draughts
and
blankets
of
the
braced
me
to
enduring
instead
of
enjoying
i
had
thought
my
holiday
too
short
and
when
i
remembered
my
life
and
work
at
home
my
official
life
and
work
it
had
been
appearing
to
me
puny
puny
said
ingeborg
her
eyes
on
his
white
tie
puny
the
draughts
and
blankets
of
the
cured
me
i
am
returning
gladly
my
life
there
i
say
to
myself
may
be
puny
but
it
is
warm
so
he
added
smiling
a
man
learns
content
taught
by
draughts
and
blankets
taught
by
going
away
oh
said
ingeborg
had
providence
then
only
led
her
to
that
poster
in
order
that
she
should
learn
content
were
dent
tours
really
run
educationally
by
providence
but
she
began
and
then
slopped
it
is
necessary
to
go
away
in
order
to
come
back
said
the
german
gentleman
again
with
patience
yes
of
course
but
the
chief
use
of
a
holiday
is
to
make
one
hungry
to
have
finished
with
it
oh
she
protested
the
joy
of
holiday
in
her
voice
ah
you
are
at
the
beginning
the
very
beginning
yet
at
the
end
you
too
will
return
home
reconciled
she
looked
at
him
and
shook
her
head
i
do
think
reconciled
is
quite
the
she
paused
thinking
to
what
she
went
on
to
puniness
too
the
two
ladies
faltered
in
their
conversation
and
glanced
at
ingeborg
and
then
at
each
other
perhaps
not
to
puniness
you
are
not
a
pastor
there
was
a
distinct
holding
of
the
breath
of
the
two
ladies
the
german
gentleman
slow
speech
fell
very
clearly
on
their
sudden
silence
no
said
ingeborg
but
what
has
that
i
am
and
it
is
a
puny
life
ingeborg
felt
a
slight
curdling
she
thought
of
her
father
also
if
you
come
to
that
a
pastor
she
was
sure
there
was
nothing
in
anything
he
ever
did
that
would
strike
him
as
puny
his
life
was
magnificent
and
important
filled
to
bursting
point
with
a
splendid
usefulness
and
with
a
tendency
to
fill
the
lives
of
every
one
who
came
within
his
reach
to
their
several
bursting
points
too
but
he
of
course
was
a
prince
of
the
church
still
he
had
gone
through
the
church
stages
beginning
humbly
yet
she
doubted
whether
at
any
moment
of
his
career
he
had
looked
at
it
and
thought
it
puny
and
was
it
not
indeed
the
highest
career
of
all
however
breathless
and
hurried
it
made
one
female
relations
in
its
upper
reaches
and
drudging
in
its
lower
the
very
highest
but
though
she
was
curdled
she
was
interested
it
might
not
be
amiss
continued
the
pastor
looking
out
of
the
window
at
some
land
they
were
passing
if
it
were
not
for
the
sundays
again
she
was
curdled
but
they
spoil
it
she
was
silent
and
the
silence
of
the
two
ladies
appeared
to
acquire
a
frost
it
is
the
fatal
habit
of
sundays
he
went
on
following
the
disappearing
land
with
his
eyes
to
recur
he
paused
as
if
waiting
for
her
to
agree
she
had
to
because
it
was
a
truth
one
could
not
get
away
from
yes
she
said
reluctantly
of
course
it
their
nature
then
a
wave
of
memories
suddenly
broke
over
her
and
she
added
warmly
oh
they
the
frost
of
the
ladies
seemed
to
settle
down
it
grew
heavy
they
interrupt
one
work
he
said
but
they
your
work
she
said
puzzled
no
she
stared
but
she
began
a
pastor
a
pastor
is
also
a
man
yes
said
ingeborg
but
you
have
no
doubt
observed
that
he
is
invariably
also
a
man
yes
said
ingeborg
but
and
a
man
of
intelligence
i
am
a
man
of
intelligence
can
not
fill
up
his
life
with
the
meagre
materials
offered
by
the
practice
of
the
tenets
of
the
lutheran
church
oh
the
church
said
ingeborg
catching
at
a
straw
any
church
she
was
silent
she
felt
how
immensely
her
father
would
not
have
liked
it
she
felt
it
was
wicked
to
sit
there
and
listen
she
also
felt
strange
and
dreadful
to
observe
refreshed
then
she
began
knitting
her
brows
for
really
this
at
its
best
was
bad
taste
and
bad
taste
she
had
always
been
taught
was
the
very
worst
oh
but
how
nice
it
was
a
little
bit
of
it
after
the
swamps
of
good
taste
one
waded
about
in
in
cathedral
cities
she
knitted
her
brows
aghast
at
her
thoughts
then
what
she
asked
you
fill
your
life
up
with
manure
said
the
german
gentleman
the
ladies
leapt
in
their
places
ma
began
ingeborg
then
stopped
i
am
engaged
in
endeavouring
to
teach
the
peasants
of
my
parish
how
best
to
farm
their
poor
pieces
of
land
oh
really
said
ingeborg
politely
i
do
it
by
example
they
do
not
attend
to
words
i
have
bought
a
few
acres
and
experiment
before
their
eyes
our
soil
is
the
worst
in
germany
it
is
inconceivably
thankless
and
the
peasants
resemble
it
oh
really
said
ingeborg
the
result
of
the
combination
is
poverty
so
then
i
suppose
said
ingeborg
with
memories
of
the
methods
you
preach
patience
patience
i
preach
manure
again
at
the
dreadful
word
the
ladies
leapt
it
is
he
said
solemnly
his
eyes
glistening
with
enthusiasm
the
foundation
of
a
nation
greatness
i
had
thought
of
it
like
that
said
ingeborg
seeing
that
he
waited
but
on
what
then
does
a
state
depend
in
the
last
resort
she
was
afraid
to
say
for
there
seemed
to
be
so
many
possible
answers
naturally
on
its
agriculture
said
the
pastor
with
the
slight
irritation
of
one
obliged
to
linger
over
the
obvious
of
course
said
the
pliable
ingeborg
trained
in
acquiescence
and
on
what
does
agriculture
depend
in
the
last
resort
brilliantly
she
hazarded
manure
for
the
third
time
the
ladies
leapt
and
the
one
next
to
her
drew
away
her
dress
he
showed
his
appreciation
of
her
intelligence
by
nodding
slowly
a
nation
must
be
fed
he
said
and
empty
fields
will
feed
no
one
of
course
not
said
ingeborg
so
that
it
is
the
chief
element
in
all
progress
for
the
root
of
progress
flourishes
only
in
a
filled
stomach
the
ladies
began
to
fan
themselves
violently
nervously
one
with
daily
the
other
with
of
course
said
ingeborg
first
said
the
german
gentleman
you
fill
your
stomach
the
lady
next
to
ingeborg
made
a
sudden
lunge
across
her
at
the
strap
excuse
me
but
do
you
mind
putting
that
window
she
said
in
a
sort
of
burst
the
german
gentleman
stemmed
in
his
speech
used
the
interval
while
ingeborg
opened
the
window
in
buttoning
up
his
overcoat
again
with
care
and
patience
and
readjusting
his
muffler
when
he
had
attended
to
these
things
he
resumed
his
enthusiasm
he
seemed
to
switch
it
on
again
the
infinite
combinations
of
it
he
exclaimed
its
infinite
varieties
kali
kainit
chilisaltpetre
superphosphates
he
rolled
out
the
words
as
though
they
were
the
verse
of
a
psalm
when
i
shut
the
door
on
myself
in
the
little
laboratory
i
have
constructed
i
shut
in
with
me
all
life
all
science
every
possibility
i
analyse
i
synthesize
i
separate
reduce
combine
i
touch
the
stars
i
stir
the
depths
the
daily
world
is
forgotten
i
forget
indeed
everything
except
my
research
and
invariably
at
the
most
profound
the
most
exalted
moments
some
one
knocks
and
tells
me
it
is
sunday
again
and
will
i
come
out
and
preach
illustration
then
why
she
asked
with
the
courage
of
curiosity
are
you
a
pastor
he
looked
at
her
indignantly
demanding
sympathy
preach
he
repeated
then
why
she
asked
with
the
courage
of
curiosity
are
you
a
pastor
because
my
father
made
me
one
but
why
are
you
still
one
because
a
man
must
live
he
ought
to
want
to
said
ingeborg
with
a
faint
flush
for
she
had
been
carefully
trained
to
shyness
when
it
came
to
pronouncing
opinions
the
bishop
called
it
being
womanly
he
ought
to
want
to
at
the
cost
of
his
convictions
nevertheless
said
the
pastor
he
does
yes
said
ingeborg
obliged
to
admit
it
even
at
redchester
cases
were
not
unknown
he
does
she
said
nodding
of
course
he
does
and
unable
not
to
be
at
least
as
honest
as
the
pastor
she
added
and
so
does
a
woman
naturally
said
the
pastor
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
then
said
impulsively
pulling
herself
a
little
forward
towards
him
by
the
window
strap
woman
does
she
doing
it
now
the
two
ladies
exchanged
glances
and
fluttered
their
fans
faster
which
woman
inquired
the
pastor
whose
mastery
of
english
though
ripe
was
not
nimble
this
one
said
ingeborg
pointing
at
herself
me
i
living
at
this
very
moment
i
whirling
along
in
this
train
i
running
away
for
this
holiday
at
the
cost
of
my
convictions
chapter
iii
after
this
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
dent
tour
should
look
favourably
on
either
ingeborg
or
the
german
gentleman
running
away
and
something
happened
at
dover
that
clinched
it
in
its
coldness
the
train
had
slowed
down
and
the
excursionists
had
become
busy
and
were
all
standing
up
expectant
and
swaying
with
their
bags
and
umbrellas
ready
in
their
hands
except
ingeborg
and
the
pastor
the
train
stopped
and
still
the
two
at
the
door
did
not
move
they
were
so
much
interested
in
what
they
were
saying
that
they
went
on
sitting
there
barbarously
corking
up
the
congested
queue
inside
the
carriage
while
streams
of
properly
liberated
passengers
poured
past
the
window
on
their
way
to
the
best
places
on
the
boat
the
queue
heaved
and
waited
holding
on
to
its
good
manners
till
the
last
possible
moment
quite
anxious
with
the
exception
of
the
two
ladies
who
were
driven
to
the
very
verge
of
naturalness
by
the
things
they
had
had
to
listen
to
lest
it
should
be
forced
to
show
what
it
was
feeling
for
what
one
is
feeling
dent
excursionists
had
surprisingly
discovered
is
always
somehow
something
rude
and
seconds
passed
and
still
it
was
kept
there
heaving
then
the
pastor
gazing
with
a
large
unhurried
interest
at
the
people
pushing
by
the
window
people
disfigured
by
haste
and
the
greed
for
the
best
places
on
the
boat
said
in
a
voice
of
mild
but
penetrating
complaint
it
almost
seemed
as
if
in
that
congested
moment
he
saw
only
leisure
for
musing
aloud
but
why
does
the
good
god
make
so
many
ugly
old
women
it
was
when
he
said
this
that
the
mountainous
lady
at
the
head
of
the
queue
flung
behaviour
to
the
winds
and
let
herself
go
uncontrolledly
you
allow
me
to
pass
she
cried
nor
did
she
give
him
another
instant
grace
but
pressed
between
his
and
ingeborg
knees
followed
torrentially
by
the
released
remainder
to
keep
us
all
waiting
there
just
while
he
blasphemed
she
panted
on
the
platform
to
her
friend
and
during
the
rest
of
the
time
the
party
was
together
it
retired
led
by
these
two
ladies
into
an
icy
exclusiveness
outside
which
and
left
together
all
day
long
ingeborg
and
the
pastor
could
not
but
make
friends
they
did
they
talked
and
they
walked
they
climbed
and
they
they
did
everything
dent
had
arranged
going
with
him
but
not
of
him
always
as
it
were
bringing
up
his
rear
equally
careful
being
equally
poor
they
avoided
the
extras
which
seemed
to
lurk
beckoning
at
every
corner
of
the
day
their
frugality
was
flagrant
and
shocked
the
other
excursionists
even
more
than
the
dreadful
things
they
said
such
bad
the
tour
declared
when
on
the
third
day
after
having
provoked
criticism
by
their
negative
attitude
towards
afternoon
tea
and
the
purchase
of
picture
postcards
they
would
not
lighten
its
several
burdens
by
taking
their
share
of
an
unincluded
outing
in
flys
along
the
lake
even
ascough
dent
distracted
representative
thought
them
undesirable
and
especially
could
make
nothing
of
ingeborg
except
that
somehow
she
was
not
dent
sort
and
the
german
gentleman
though
in
appearance
a
more
familiar
type
became
whenever
he
opened
his
mouth
grossly
unfamiliar
was
the
expression
the
largest
lady
had
used
bearing
down
on
ascough
at
dover
to
complain
adding
that
as
she
had
done
all
her
travelling
for
years
with
and
through
dent
she
felt
justified
in
demanding
that
this
man
mouth
should
be
immediately
cleansed
i
not
a
toothbrush
bawn
replied
the
distracted
ascough
engaged
at
that
moment
in
struggling
for
air
and
light
in
the
middle
of
his
clinging
flock
then
i
shall
write
to
dent
himself
said
bawn
indignantly
and
ascough
intimidated
fought
himself
free
and
followed
her
down
the
platform
inquiring
dreadfully
really
he
seemed
to
be
a
person
of
little
refinement
whether
then
the
german
gentleman
conversation
had
been
obscene
i
can
get
rid
of
him
if
it
been
obscene
you
know
said
ascough
was
it
so
that
bawn
incensed
and
baffled
was
obliged
for
the
dignity
of
her
womanhood
to
say
she
was
glad
to
have
to
inform
him
she
did
not
know
what
that
word
meant
but
the
pastor
his
name
was
dremmel
he
told
ingeborg
robert
dremmel
took
everything
that
happened
with
simplicity
they
might
shut
him
out
and
he
would
never
notice
it
they
might
turn
their
backs
and
he
would
never
know
nothing
that
dent
tour
could
do
in
the
way
of
ostracizing
would
have
been
able
to
pierce
through
to
his
consciousness
having
decided
that
the
women
of
it
were
plain
and
the
men
uninteresting
he
thought
of
them
no
more
with
his
customary
he
concentrated
his
attention
at
first
only
on
switzerland
which
was
what
he
was
paying
to
see
and
he
found
it
pleasant
that
the
young
lady
in
grey
should
so
naturally
join
him
in
this
concentration
just
for
a
few
hours
at
the
very
beginning
he
had
thought
her
naturalness
her
ready
friendliness
a
little
unwomanly
she
was
he
thought
a
little
too
productive
of
an
impression
that
she
was
a
kind
of
boy
she
had
no
which
he
had
been
taught
by
his
mother
to
confound
with
modesty
and
no
desire
whatever
apparently
to
please
the
opposite
sex
she
went
to
sleep
for
instance
towards
the
end
of
the
long
journey
right
in
front
of
him
letting
her
mouth
open
if
it
wanted
to
and
not
bothering
at
all
that
he
should
probably
be
looking
at
it
herr
dremmel
who
besides
his
agricultural
researches
prided
himself
on
a
liberal
if
intermittent
interest
in
womanly
charm
regretted
these
shortcomings
but
only
for
a
few
hours
at
the
very
beginning
by
the
end
of
the
first
day
in
lucerne
he
was
finding
it
pleasant
to
pair
off
with
her
womanly
or
unwomanly
he
liked
to
talk
to
her
he
discovered
he
could
talk
to
her
as
he
had
been
unable
to
talk
to
the
few
east
prussian
young
ladies
he
had
met
in
spite
of
the
stiff
intensity
of
their
desire
to
please
him
he
searched
about
for
a
reason
and
concluded
that
it
was
because
she
was
interested
whatever
subject
he
discoursed
upon
she
came
so
it
seemed
running
to
meet
him
she
listened
intelligently
and
with
a
pliability
he
did
not
then
know
about
the
training
rarely
to
be
found
in
combination
with
intelligence
intelligent
persons
are
very
apt
he
remembered
to
argue
and
object
this
young
lady
was
intelligent
without
argument
a
most
comfortable
compound
and
before
a
definite
opinion
had
a
graceful
knack
of
doubling
up
and
if
her
doublings
up
were
at
all
as
they
sometimes
were
delayed
while
she
put
in
but
he
only
needed
repeat
with
patience
to
bring
out
an
admirable
submissive
sunniness
he
could
not
of
course
know
of
her
severe
training
in
sunniness
by
the
end
of
the
second
day
he
had
told
her
more
about
his
life
and
his
home
and
his
work
and
his
ambitions
than
he
had
ever
told
anybody
and
she
had
told
him
only
he
was
unable
to
find
that
so
interesting
about
her
life
and
her
home
and
her
work
she
had
no
ambitions
she
explained
which
he
said
was
well
in
a
woman
he
was
hardly
aware
of
the
bishop
so
lightly
did
she
skim
over
him
by
the
end
of
the
third
day
he
had
observed
what
had
curiously
escaped
him
before
that
she
was
pretty
not
of
course
in
the
abundant
east
prussian
way
the
way
of
generous
curves
and
of
what
he
now
began
to
think
were
after
all
superfluities
but
with
delicacy
and
restraint
he
no
longer
considered
she
would
be
better
fattened
up
and
he
was
noticing
her
clothes
and
after
a
painstaking
comparing
of
them
with
those
of
the
other
ladies
applying
to
them
the
adjective
elegant
by
the
end
of
the
fourth
he
admitted
to
himself
that
very
probably
he
was
soon
going
to
be
in
love
by
the
end
of
the
fifth
he
knew
without
a
doubt
that
the
thing
had
happened
the
to
him
incontrovertible
proof
being
that
on
this
day
switzerland
sank
into
being
just
her
background
even
the
rigi
he
observed
with
interest
was
nothing
to
him
he
walked
up
it
he
who
never
walked
up
anything
because
she
wanted
to
he
toiled
up
panting
and
forgot
how
warmly
he
was
dissolving
inside
his
black
clothes
in
the
pleasure
of
watching
her
on
ahead
glancing
in
and
out
of
the
sunshine
that
fell
clear
and
white
on
her
as
she
fluttered
above
him
among
the
pine
trunks
and
when
he
got
to
the
top
instead
of
looking
at
the
view
he
sat
down
in
the
nearest
seat
and
became
absorbed
in
the
way
the
burning
afternoon
light
seemed
to
get
caught
in
her
hair
as
she
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
plateau
and
made
it
look
the
colour
of
flames
this
was
very
interesting
he
had
never
yet
within
his
recollection
preferred
hair
to
views
a
curious
result
he
reflected
of
his
harmless
holiday
enterprise
he
had
not
intended
to
marry
he
was
and
dedicated
to
his
work
he
felt
it
was
a
noble
work
this
patient
proving
to
ignorance
and
prejudice
of
what
could
be
done
with
barrenness
if
only
you
mixed
it
with
brains
he
was
fairly
comfortable
in
his
housekeeping
having
found
a
woman
who
was
a
widow
and
had
therefore
learned
the
great
lesson
that
only
widows
ever
really
know
that
a
man
must
be
let
alone
he
was
poor
and
what
he
could
spare
by
rigid
economies
went
into
the
few
acres
of
sand
that
were
to
be
the
light
he
had
to
offer
to
lighten
the
gentiles
every
man
he
thought
should
offer
some
light
to
the
abounding
gentiles
before
he
died
some
light
which
however
small
might
be
kept
so
clear
that
they
could
not
choose
but
see
it
a
wife
he
had
felt
when
considering
the
question
from
time
to
time
which
was
each
year
in
the
early
spring
would
come
between
him
and
his
light
she
would
be
a
shadow
and
a
voluminous
shadow
his
church
and
the
business
of
preaching
in
it
were
already
sufficiently
interrupting
but
they
were
weekly
a
wife
would
be
every
day
he
could
lock
her
out
of
the
laboratory
he
would
reflect
and
perhaps
also
out
of
the
when
he
became
aware
that
he
was
earnestly
considering
what
other
rooms
he
could
lock
her
out
of
and
discovered
that
he
would
want
to
lock
her
out
of
nearly
all
he
as
a
wise
and
honest
man
decided
he
had
best
leave
the
virgins
of
the
neighbourhood
alone
the
question
occupied
him
regularly
every
year
in
the
first
warm
days
of
spring
for
the
rest
of
the
year
he
mostly
forgot
it
absorbed
in
his
work
and
here
he
was
on
the
top
of
the
rigi
a
cool
place
almost
wintry
with
it
suddenly
become
so
living
that
compared
to
it
his
fertilizers
seemed
ridiculous
he
examined
this
change
of
attitude
with
care
he
was
proud
of
the
way
he
had
fallen
in
love
he
a
poor
man
doing
it
without
any
knowledge
of
whether
the
young
lady
had
enough
or
indeed
any
money
he
sat
there
and
took
pleasure
in
this
proof
that
though
he
was
he
could
yet
be
reckless
he
was
greatly
pleased
at
finding
himself
so
much
attracted
that
if
it
should
turn
out
that
she
was
penniless
he
would
still
manage
to
marry
her
and
would
make
it
possible
by
a
series
of
masterly
financial
skirmishings
the
chief
of
which
would
be
the
dismissal
of
the
widow
and
the
replacing
of
her
dinginess
her
arrested
effect
of
having
been
nipped
in
the
bud
although
there
was
no
bud
by
this
incorporate
sunshine
the
young
lady
tact
of
which
he
had
seen
several
instances
would
cause
her
to
confine
her
sunshine
to
appropriate
moments
she
would
not
overflow
it
into
his
working
hours
besides
marriage
was
a
great
readjuster
of
values
after
it
he
had
not
a
doubt
his
wife
would
fall
quite
naturally
into
her
place
which
would
though
honourable
be
yet
a
little
lower
than
the
fertilizers
if
it
were
not
so
if
marriage
did
not
readjust
the
upset
incidental
to
its
preliminaries
what
a
disastrous
thing
falling
in
love
would
be
no
serious
man
would
be
able
to
let
himself
do
it
but
how
interesting
it
was
the
way
nature
that
old
hostility
that
ancient
enemy
to
man
thought
did
somehow
manage
to
trip
him
up
sooner
or
later
and
how
still
more
interesting
the
ingenuity
with
which
man
aware
of
this
trick
and
determined
to
avoid
the
disturbance
of
a
duration
of
affection
had
invented
marriage
he
gazed
very
benevolently
at
the
little
figure
on
the
edge
of
the
view
why
not
marry
her
now
and
frugally
convert
the
of
excursion
into
a
honeymoon
with
the
large
simplicity
and
obliviousness
to
banns
and
licences
of
a
man
of
scientific
preoccupations
he
saw
no
reason
against
this
course
it
was
obvious
it
was
desirable
it
would
not
only
save
her
going
back
to
england
first
it
would
save
the
extra
journey
there
for
him
they
would
go
straight
home
to
east
prussia
together
at
the
end
of
the
week
and
as
for
doing
it
without
her
family
knowledge
if
she
could
run
away
from
them
as
she
had
told
him
she
had
done
just
for
the
sake
of
a
jaunt
how
much
more
readily
with
what
increase
of
swiftness
indeed
would
she
run
for
the
sake
of
a
husband
tell
me
little
one
he
said
when
she
rejoined
him
will
you
marry
me
chapter
iv
ingeborg
was
astonished
she
stared
at
him
speechless
the
gulf
between
even
the
warmest
friendliness
and
marriage
she
had
she
knew
been
daily
increasing
in
warm
friendliness
towards
him
characteristically
expecting
nothing
back
that
he
too
should
grow
warm
had
not
remotely
occurred
to
her
nobody
had
ever
grown
warm
to
her
in
that
way
there
had
always
been
judith
that
miracle
of
beauty
to
blot
her
into
plainness
it
is
true
the
senior
curate
of
the
redchester
parish
church
had
said
to
her
once
in
his
exhausted
oxford
voice
you
know
i
do
mind
about
faces
will
you
marry
me
and
she
had
refused
so
gingerly
with
such
fear
of
hurting
his
feelings
that
for
a
week
he
had
supposed
he
was
engaged
but
one
would
not
call
that
warmth
as
the
sun
puts
out
the
light
of
a
candle
so
did
the
radiance
of
judith
extinguish
ingeborg
they
were
so
oddly
alike
and
ingeborg
was
the
pale
diminished
shadow
judith
was
ingeborg
grown
tall
grown
exquisite
ingeborg
wrought
wonderfully
in
ivory
and
gold
no
man
could
possibly
fall
in
love
with
ingeborg
while
there
before
his
very
eyes
was
apparently
exactly
the
same
girl
only
translated
into
loveliness
from
the
first
it
had
been
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
ingeborg
to
be
plain
and
passed
over
judith
was
always
beside
her
whenever
there
was
a
pause
in
her
work
for
her
father
it
was
filled
by
the
chaperoning
of
judith
she
accepted
the
situation
with
complete
philosophy
for
nothing
was
quite
so
evident
as
judith
beauty
and
she
used
in
corners
at
parties
to
keep
herself
awake
by
saying
over
bits
of
the
psalms
on
which
not
being
allowed
to
read
novels
her
literary
enthusiasms
were
concentrated
it
was
then
really
a
very
astonishing
thing
to
a
person
practised
in
this
healthy
and
useful
humility
to
have
some
one
asking
her
to
marry
him
that
it
should
be
herr
dremmel
seemed
to
her
even
more
astonishing
he
did
look
like
somebody
one
married
he
did
even
look
like
somebody
who
wanted
to
marry
one
he
sat
there
his
hands
folded
on
the
knob
of
his
stick
gazing
at
her
with
an
entirely
placid
benevolence
and
asked
her
the
surprising
question
as
though
it
were
a
way
of
making
conversation
it
is
true
he
had
not
called
her
little
one
before
but
that
she
felt
as
she
stood
before
him
considering
this
thing
that
had
happened
to
her
was
pretty
rather
than
impassioned
here
was
an
awkward
and
odd
result
of
her
holiday
enterprise
it
very
unexpected
she
said
lamely
yes
he
agreed
it
is
unexpected
it
has
greatly
surprised
me
i
very
sorry
she
said
about
what
are
you
sorry
little
one
i
ca
accept
your
your
offer
what
there
is
some
one
else
not
sort
of
some
one
but
there
my
father
he
made
a
great
sweep
with
his
arm
fathers
he
said
and
pushed
the
whole
breed
out
of
sight
he
very
important
important
little
one
when
will
you
marry
me
i
ca
leave
him
he
became
patient
it
has
been
laid
down
that
a
woman
shall
leave
father
and
mother
and
any
other
related
obstacle
she
may
have
the
misfortune
to
be
hampered
with
and
cleave
only
to
her
husband
that
was
about
a
man
cleaving
to
his
wife
there
was
anything
said
about
a
woman
besides
she
stopped
she
could
tell
him
that
she
did
want
to
cleave
he
gazed
at
her
a
moment
in
silence
he
had
not
contemplated
a
necessity
for
persuasion
this
he
then
said
with
severity
is
prevarication
she
sat
down
on
the
grass
and
clasped
her
hands
round
her
knees
and
looked
up
at
him
she
had
taken
off
her
hat
when
first
she
got
to
the
top
to
fan
herself
and
had
not
put
it
on
again
as
she
sat
there
with
her
back
to
the
glow
of
the
sky
the
wind
softly
lifted
the
rings
of
her
hair
and
the
sun
shone
through
them
wonderfully
they
seemed
to
flicker
gently
to
and
fro
little
tongues
of
fire
why
said
herr
dremmel
suddenly
leaning
forward
and
staring
you
are
like
a
spirit
this
pleased
her
for
a
moment
her
eyes
danced
like
a
spirit
he
repeated
and
here
am
i
talking
heavily
to
you
as
though
you
were
an
ordinary
woman
little
one
how
does
one
trap
a
spirit
into
marrying
tell
me
for
very
earnestly
do
i
desire
to
be
shown
the
way
one
does
said
ingeborg
ah
do
not
be
difficult
you
have
been
so
easy
of
such
a
comfortable
response
in
all
things
up
to
now
but
this
began
ingeborg
yes
this
i
well
know
he
was
more
stirred
than
he
had
thought
possible
he
was
becoming
almost
eager
but
asked
ingeborg
exploring
this
new
interesting
situation
why
do
you
want
to
want
to
marry
you
yes
because
said
herr
dremmel
immensely
prompt
i
have
had
the
extreme
good
fortune
to
fall
in
love
with
you
again
she
looked
pleased
and
i
do
not
ask
you
he
went
on
to
love
me
or
whether
you
do
love
me
it
would
be
presumption
on
my
part
and
not
if
you
did
very
modest
on
yours
that
is
the
difference
between
a
man
and
a
woman
he
loves
before
marriage
and
she
does
not
love
till
after
oh
said
ingeborg
interested
and
what
does
he
the
woman
continued
herr
dremmel
feels
affection
and
esteem
before
marriage
and
the
man
feels
affection
and
esteem
after
oh
said
ingeborg
reflecting
she
began
to
tear
up
tufts
of
grass
it
seems
chilly
she
said
chilly
he
echoed
he
let
his
stick
drop
and
got
up
and
came
and
sat
down
or
rather
let
himself
down
carefully
on
the
grass
beside
her
chilly
do
you
not
know
that
a
decent
chill
is
a
great
preservative
hot
things
decay
frozen
things
do
not
live
a
just
measure
of
chill
preserves
the
life
of
the
affections
it
is
by
a
very
proper
dispensation
of
nature
provided
before
marriage
by
the
woman
and
afterwards
by
the
man
the
balance
is
in
this
way
nicely
held
and
peace
and
harmony
which
nourish
best
at
a
low
temperature
prevail
she
looked
at
him
and
laughed
there
was
no
one
in
redchester
and
redchester
was
all
she
knew
of
life
in
the
least
like
herr
dremmel
she
stretched
herself
in
the
roomy
difference
happy
free
at
her
ease
but
i
can
not
believe
burst
out
herr
dremmel
with
a
passionate
vigour
that
astonished
him
more
than
anything
in
his
whole
life
as
he
seized
the
hand
that
kept
on
tearing
up
grass
i
can
not
believe
that
you
will
not
marry
me
i
can
not
believe
that
you
will
refuse
a
good
and
loving
husband
that
you
will
prefer
to
remain
with
your
father
and
solidify
into
yet
one
more
frostbitten
virgin
into
a
what
repeated
ingeborg
struck
by
this
image
of
herself
in
the
future
she
began
to
laugh
then
stopped
she
stared
at
him
her
grey
eyes
very
wide
open
she
forgot
herr
dremmel
and
that
he
was
still
clutching
her
hand
and
all
the
grass
in
it
while
her
mind
flashed
over
the
years
that
had
gone
and
the
years
that
were
to
come
they
would
be
alike
they
had
not
been
able
to
frostbite
her
yet
because
she
had
been
too
young
but
they
would
get
her
presently
their
daily
repeated
busy
emptiness
their
rush
of
barren
duties
their
meagre
moments
of
what
when
she
was
younger
used
to
be
happiness
but
had
lately
only
been
relief
those
rare
moments
when
her
father
praised
her
would
settle
down
presently
and
freeze
her
dead
her
face
grew
solemn
it
true
she
said
slowly
i
shall
be
a
frostbitten
virgin
i
doomed
my
father
wo
ever
let
me
marry
you
infinitely
childish
one
he
cried
becoming
angry
when
it
is
well
known
that
all
fathers
wish
to
get
rid
of
all
daughters
you
do
understand
it
different
my
father
why
she
broke
out
i
used
to
dose
myself
secretly
with
cod
liver
oil
so
as
to
keep
up
to
his
level
he
wonderful
when
he
praised
me
i
used
to
sleep
and
if
he
scolded
me
it
seemed
to
send
me
lame
herr
dremmel
sawed
her
hand
up
and
down
in
his
irritation
what
is
this
irrelevant
talk
he
said
i
offer
you
marriage
and
you
respond
with
information
about
cod
liver
oil
i
do
not
believe
the
father
obstacle
i
do
not
recognize
my
honest
little
friend
of
these
last
days
it
is
waste
of
time
not
being
open
would
you
then
if
it
were
not
for
your
father
marry
me
but
ingeborg
flashed
round
at
him
swept
off
her
feet
as
she
so
often
was
by
an
impulse
of
utter
truth
it
of
him
that
i
and
the
instant
she
had
said
it
she
was
shocked
she
stared
at
herr
dremmel
with
contrition
the
disloyalty
of
it
the
ugliness
of
telling
a
stranger
and
a
stranger
with
hair
like
fur
anything
at
all
about
those
closely
related
persons
she
had
been
taught
to
describe
to
herself
as
her
dear
ones
oh
she
cried
dragging
her
hand
away
let
my
hand
go
let
my
hand
she
tried
to
get
on
to
her
feet
but
with
an
energy
he
did
not
know
he
possessed
he
pulled
her
down
again
he
did
not
recognize
any
of
the
things
he
was
feeling
and
doing
the
dremmel
of
his
real
nature
of
those
calm
depths
where
lay
happy
fields
of
future
fertilizers
gazed
at
this
inflamed
conduct
going
on
at
the
top
in
astonishment
no
he
said
with
immense
determination
you
will
sit
here
and
explain
about
your
father
it
a
dreadful
thing
replied
ingeborg
suddenly
discovering
that
of
all
things
she
did
not
like
being
clutched
and
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
her
head
a
little
thrown
back
that
one
ca
leave
home
even
for
a
week
without
getting
into
a
scrape
a
scrape
you
call
it
a
scrape
when
a
good
man
here
a
person
who
goes
away
for
a
little
change
privately
and
before
she
knows
where
she
is
she
being
held
down
on
the
top
of
the
rigi
and
ordered
by
a
strange
man
by
her
future
husband
cried
herr
dremmel
who
was
finding
the
making
of
offers
more
difficult
than
he
had
by
a
strange
man
to
explain
her
father
as
though
anybody
could
ever
explain
their
father
as
though
anybody
could
ever
explain
god
in
heaven
cried
herr
dremmel
do
not
explain
him
then
just
marry
me
and
at
this
moment
the
procession
of
the
rest
of
dent
tour
headed
by
ascough
watch
in
hand
emerged
from
the
hôtel
where
it
had
been
having
tea
on
to
the
plateau
wiping
its
mouths
in
readiness
for
the
sunset
with
the
jerk
of
a
thing
that
has
been
stung
it
swerved
aside
as
it
was
about
almost
to
tread
on
the
two
on
the
grass
ingeborg
sat
very
stiff
and
straight
and
pretended
to
be
staring
intently
at
the
view
forgetting
that
it
was
behind
her
she
flushed
when
she
found
there
was
no
time
to
move
far
enough
from
herr
dremmel
for
a
gap
to
be
visible
between
them
look
at
those
two
now
whispered
the
young
lady
last
in
the
procession
to
the
young
man
brushing
bread
and
butter
out
of
his
tie
who
walked
beside
her
he
looked
and
seemed
inclined
to
linger
she
very
is
she
he
said
oh
do
you
think
so
said
his
companion
i
never
think
pretty
who
is
you
know
what
i
mean
really
you
know
and
she
hurried
him
on
because
she
said
if
he
did
hurry
he
miss
the
sunset
chapter
v
ingeborg
spent
most
of
the
night
on
a
hard
chair
at
her
bedroom
window
earnestly
endeavouring
to
think
it
was
very
unfortunate
but
she
found
an
immense
difficulty
at
all
times
in
thinking
she
could
keep
her
father
affairs
in
the
neatest
order
but
not
her
own
thoughts
there
were
so
many
of
them
and
they
all
seemed
to
jump
about
inside
her
and
want
to
get
thought
first
they
would
not
go
into
ordered
rows
they
had
no
patience
often
she
had
suspected
they
were
not
thoughts
at
all
but
just
feelings
and
that
depressed
her
for
it
made
her
drop
she
feared
to
the
level
of
the
insect
world
and
enter
the
category
of
things
that
were
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
to
heaven
and
to
a
bishop
daughter
this
was
disquieting
most
of
her
thoughts
she
was
immediately
sorry
for
they
were
so
unlike
anything
she
could
with
propriety
say
out
loud
at
home
to
herr
dremmel
she
had
been
able
to
say
them
all
as
far
as
speech
a
limping
vehicle
could
be
made
to
go
and
this
was
another
of
his
refreshing
qualities
she
did
not
of
course
know
of
that
absorbed
man
habit
of
listening
to
her
with
only
one
ear
a
benevolent
ear
but
only
one
while
with
the
other
turned
inwards
he
listened
to
the
working
out
in
his
mind
of
problems
in
chilisaltpetre
and
she
sat
staring
out
of
the
window
at
the
stars
and
her
hands
held
tightly
in
her
lap
and
told
herself
that
the
moment
had
come
for
clear
consecutive
thought
thought
she
repeated
severely
aware
already
of
the
interlaced
dancing
going
on
in
her
brain
what
was
she
going
to
do
about
herr
dremmel
about
going
home
about
oh
about
anything
they
had
come
down
the
rigi
soberly
and
in
the
train
nobody
as
usual
spoke
to
them
and
for
the
first
time
in
their
friendship
neither
had
they
spoken
to
each
other
they
had
had
a
speechless
dinner
he
had
looked
preoccupied
and
when
directly
after
it
she
said
good
night
he
had
drawn
her
out
into
the
passage
and
solemnly
adjured
her
while
the
pretended
he
was
out
of
to
have
done
with
prevarications
what
he
would
suggest
he
said
was
a
comfortable
betrothal
next
day
it
was
too
late
for
one
that
night
he
said
pulling
out
his
watch
but
next
day
and
as
she
retreated
sideways
step
by
step
up
the
stairs
silent
through
an
inability
immediately
to
find
an
answer
that
seemed
tactful
enough
he
had
eyed
her
very
severely
and
inquired
of
her
with
a
raised
voice
what
then
the
ado
was
all
about
she
had
turned
at
that
giving
up
the
search
for
tact
and
had
run
up
the
remaining
stairs
rather
breathlessly
feeling
that
herr
dremmel
on
marriage
had
an
engulfing
quality
and
he
after
a
moment
perplexity
on
the
mat
at
the
bottom
had
gone
to
the
a
baffled
man
now
she
sat
at
the
window
considering
her
journey
home
was
only
two
days
off
and
the
thought
of
what
would
be
said
to
her
when
she
got
there
and
of
what
her
answers
would
be
like
ran
down
the
back
of
her
neck
and
spine
as
though
some
one
were
drawing
a
light
finger
over
the
shrinking
skin
she
had
been
persuading
herself
that
her
little
holiday
was
harmless
and
natural
and
now
this
business
with
herr
dremmel
would
she
felt
do
away
with
all
that
and
justify
a
wrath
in
her
father
that
she
might
else
for
her
private
solace
and
encouragement
have
looked
upon
as
unreasonable
it
is
a
peculiarity
of
parents
reflected
ingeborg
that
they
are
always
being
justified
however
small
and
innocent
what
you
are
doing
may
be
if
they
disapprove
something
turns
up
to
cause
them
to
have
been
altogether
right
she
remembered
little
things
small
occasions
of
her
younger
days
this
was
a
big
occasion
and
what
had
turned
up
on
it
was
herr
dremmel
it
was
a
pity
oh
it
was
a
pity
she
had
considered
before
she
left
london
so
impulsively
whether
when
she
got
back
to
redchester
she
was
going
to
be
untruthful
or
not
she
had
considered
nothing
except
the
acuteness
of
the
joy
of
running
away
now
she
was
faced
by
the
really
awful
question
of
lying
or
not
lying
it
was
ugly
to
lie
at
all
it
was
dreadful
to
lie
to
one
father
but
to
lie
to
a
bishop
raised
the
operation
from
just
a
private
sin
which
god
would
deal
with
kindly
on
being
asked
to
a
crime
you
were
punished
for
if
it
was
a
cathedral
you
did
it
to
a
real
crime
the
crime
of
sacrilege
impossible
to
profane
a
sacred
and
consecrated
object
like
a
bishop
doubly
and
trebly
impossible
if
you
were
that
object
own
daughter
her
tightly
folded
hands
went
cold
as
she
realised
she
was
undoubtedly
going
to
be
truthful
she
was
every
bit
as
valiant
as
her
swedish
grandmother
had
been
that
grandmother
who
was
aware
of
the
dangers
of
the
things
she
did
with
her
mountains
and
her
gusty
lakes
and
defied
them
but
her
grandmother
knew
no
fear
and
ingeborg
knew
it
very
well
hers
was
the
real
courage
found
only
in
the
entirely
terrified
who
terrified
yet
see
the
thing
whatever
it
is
doggedly
through
she
was
faint
yet
pursuing
she
saw
much
terror
in
her
immediate
future
she
dreaded
having
to
be
courageous
she
felt
she
was
too
small
really
for
the
bravely
truthful
answering
of
her
magnificent
father
questions
he
would
have
the
catechism
and
the
confirmation
service
on
his
side
as
well
as
the
laws
of
right
behaviour
and
filial
love
it
did
seem
fair
one
argue
with
a
parent
one
could
answer
back
while
as
for
a
bishop
one
could
do
anything
at
all
with
him
except
hastily
agree
there
was
just
a
possibility
but
how
remote
that
her
father
would
be
too
busy
to
ask
questions
she
sighed
as
she
reflected
how
little
she
could
count
on
that
and
how
the
most
superficial
inquiry
about
her
aunt
or
the
dentist
would
bring
out
the
whole
story
and
here
was
herr
dremmel
who
thought
nothing
at
all
of
him
even
in
regard
to
an
enormous
undertaking
like
his
daughter
marriage
there
was
something
sublime
in
such
detachment
she
felt
the
largeness
of
the
freedom
of
it
blowing
in
her
face
like
a
brisk
invigorating
wind
there
seemed
to
be
no
hedges
round
herr
dremmel
he
was
as
a
person
as
she
had
ever
met
he
cared
nothing
for
other
people
opinion
that
chief
enslavement
of
her
home
and
he
was
an
orphan
sad
to
be
an
orphan
thought
ingeborg
sighing
sad
of
course
not
to
have
any
dear
ones
but
it
did
seem
to
be
a
condition
that
avoided
the
dilemma
whose
horns
were
concealment
by
means
of
untruths
and
the
screwing
up
of
oneself
to
that
clammily
cold
and
forlorn
condition
having
courage
of
course
herr
dremmel
did
know
her
father
he
had
faced
that
impressive
personality
would
he
be
quite
so
detached
and
easily
indifferent
if
he
had
she
thought
with
a
shiver
of
what
such
a
meeting
supposing
just
for
the
sake
of
supposing
that
she
allowed
herself
to
become
engaged
would
be
like
would
herr
dremmel
in
that
setting
of
carefully
subdued
splendour
of
wainscoting
and
oriels
seem
to
her
as
free
and
delightful
as
he
seemed
on
a
tour
of
frugal
backgrounds
would
she
in
the
presence
of
the
bishop
horrified
disapproval
be
able
to
see
him
as
she
had
been
seeing
him
now
she
had
not
explored
very
far
into
her
own
resources
yet
but
she
had
begun
lately
to
perceive
that
she
was
pliable
she
bent
easily
she
felt
and
deplored
having
to
feel
in
the
direction
desired
by
the
persons
she
was
with
and
who
laid
hold
of
her
with
authority
it
is
true
she
sprang
back
again
as
she
had
discovered
so
surprisingly
in
london
the
instant
the
hold
was
relaxed
but
it
seemed
that
she
sprang
only
to
do
as
she
now
with
a
headshake
admitted
things
and
her
training
in
acquiescence
and
distrust
of
herself
was
very
complete
and
back
in
her
home
would
she
not
at
once
bend
into
the
old
curve
again
was
it
possible
would
it
ever
be
possible
in
her
presence
to
disassociate
herself
from
his
points
of
view
what
his
view
of
herr
dremmel
would
be
she
very
exactly
knew
did
she
to
disassociate
herself
from
it
she
pushed
back
her
chair
and
began
to
walk
quickly
up
and
down
the
narrow
little
room
if
she
did
disassociate
herself
it
meant
marriage
and
marriage
in
stark
defiance
of
the
whole
of
her
world
redchester
would
be
appalled
the
diocese
would
grieve
for
its
bishop
the
county
would
discuss
her
antagonistically
at
a
hundred
well
and
while
they
were
doing
it
where
would
she
be
her
blood
began
suddenly
to
dance
she
was
seized
as
she
had
been
in
london
by
that
overwhelming
desire
to
shake
off
old
things
and
set
her
face
towards
the
utterly
new
while
all
these
people
were
nodding
and
whispering
in
their
stuffy
stale
world
she
would
be
safe
in
east
prussia
a
place
that
seemed
infinitely
remote
a
place
herr
dremmel
had
described
to
her
as
full
of
forests
and
water
and
immense
stretches
of
waving
rye
the
lakes
were
fringed
with
rushes
the
forests
came
down
to
their
edges
his
own
garden
ended
in
a
little
path
through
a
lilac
hedge
that
took
you
down
between
the
rye
to
the
rushes
and
the
water
and
the
first
great
pines
oh
she
knew
it
as
though
she
had
seen
it
she
had
lured
him
on
so
often
to
describing
it
to
her
he
thought
nothing
of
it
talked
indeed
of
it
with
disgust
as
a
place
well
it
was
these
places
that
her
body
and
spirit
cried
out
for
space
freedom
quiet
the
wind
ruffling
the
rye
the
water
splashing
softly
against
the
side
of
the
punt
there
was
a
punt
she
had
extracted
the
larks
singing
up
in
the
sunlight
the
shining
clouds
passing
slowly
across
the
blue
she
wanted
to
be
alone
with
these
things
after
the
years
of
deafening
hurry
at
redchester
with
a
longing
that
was
like
she
somehow
that
once
she
used
to
be
with
them
long
ago
far
away
and
there
used
to
be
little
things
when
you
lay
face
downwards
on
the
grass
little
lovely
things
that
smelt
beautiful
leaves
and
a
tiny
aromatic
plant
with
a
white
flower
like
a
star
that
you
rubbed
between
your
fingers
she
stood
still
a
moment
frowning
trying
to
remember
more
it
in
england
but
even
as
she
puzzled
the
vision
slipped
away
from
her
and
was
lost
she
wanted
to
read
and
walk
and
think
she
was
hungry
to
read
at
last
what
she
chose
and
walk
at
last
where
she
chose
and
think
at
last
exactly
what
she
chose
was
the
enough
for
one
in
the
way
of
poetry
and
all
those
mild
novels
her
mother
read
sandwiched
between
the
biographies
of
more
bishops
and
little
books
of
comfort
with
crosses
on
them
that
asked
rude
questions
as
to
whether
you
had
been
greedy
or
dainty
or
had
used
words
with
a
double
meaning
during
the
day
were
they
enough
for
a
soul
that
had
quite
alone
with
no
father
giving
directions
presently
to
face
its
god
her
family
held
strongly
that
for
daughters
to
read
in
the
daytime
was
to
be
idle
well
if
it
was
thought
ingeborg
lifting
her
head
that
head
that
drooped
so
apologetically
at
home
with
the
defiance
that
distance
encourages
then
being
idle
was
a
blessed
thing
and
the
sooner
one
got
away
to
where
one
could
be
it
uninterruptedly
the
better
in
that
parsonage
away
in
east
prussia
for
instance
one
would
be
able
to
read
and
read
herr
dremmel
had
explained
a
hundred
times
about
his
laboratory
and
he
himself
locked
into
it
and
only
asking
to
be
left
locked
surely
that
was
an
admirable
quality
in
a
husband
that
he
kept
himself
locked
up
and
the
parsonage
was
on
the
edge
of
the
village
and
the
little
garden
at
the
back
had
nothing
between
it
and
the
sunset
and
all
god
other
dear
arrangements
except
a
solitary
and
windmill
it
was
about
one
in
the
morning
that
her
courage
however
altogether
ebbed
at
the
prospect
of
going
home
what
would
it
be
like
taking
up
her
filialities
again
and
all
of
them
henceforth
so
terribly
tarnished
she
would
be
a
returning
prodigal
for
whom
no
calf
was
killed
but
who
instead
of
the
succulences
of
a
more
liberal
age
would
be
offered
an
awful
opportunity
of
explaining
her
conduct
to
a
father
who
would
interrupt
her
the
instant
she
began
and
do
the
explaining
himself
how
was
she
going
to
face
it
all
alone
if
only
she
could
have
been
in
love
with
herr
dremmel
with
what
courage
she
would
have
faced
her
family
then
if
she
had
been
in
love
with
him
and
come
to
them
her
hand
in
his
if
only
he
looked
more
like
the
lovers
you
see
in
pictures
like
the
one
in
leighton
wedded
for
instance
a
very
beautiful
picture
ingeborg
thought
but
not
like
any
of
the
wedded
in
redchester
so
that
if
she
could
be
in
love
she
could
at
least
persuade
herself
she
was
if
only
he
had
proper
hair
instead
of
just
beaver
she
liked
him
so
much
she
had
even
at
particular
moments
of
his
conversation
gone
so
far
as
to
delight
in
him
but
marriage
what
was
marriage
why
did
they
never
talk
about
it
at
home
in
the
bishop
palace
it
might
for
all
the
mentioning
it
got
be
one
of
the
seven
deadly
sins
you
talked
there
of
the
married
and
sometimes
but
with
reserve
of
getting
married
but
marriage
itself
and
what
it
was
and
meant
was
never
discussed
she
had
received
the
impression
owing
to
these
silences
that
though
it
was
god
ordinance
as
her
father
in
his
official
capacity
at
weddings
reiterated
it
was
a
reluctant
ordinance
established
apparently
because
there
seemed
no
other
way
of
getting
round
what
appeared
to
be
a
difficulty
what
was
the
difficulty
she
had
never
in
her
busy
life
thought
about
it
marriage
had
not
concerned
her
it
would
not
be
nice
she
had
felt
unconsciously
adopting
the
opinion
of
her
environment
for
a
girl
who
was
not
going
to
marry
to
get
thinking
of
it
and
it
really
had
not
interested
her
she
had
quite
naturally
turned
her
eyes
away
but
now
this
question
of
facing
her
father
this
need
of
being
backed
up
this
longing
to
get
away
from
things
forced
her
to
look
besides
she
would
have
to
give
herr
dremmel
some
sort
of
answer
in
the
morning
and
the
facing
of
herr
dremmel
required
courage
too
of
a
different
kind
but
certainly
courage
she
was
so
reluctant
to
hurt
or
disappoint
it
had
seemed
all
her
life
the
most
beautiful
of
pleasures
to
give
people
what
they
wanted
to
get
them
to
smile
to
see
them
look
content
but
suppose
herr
dremmel
before
he
could
be
got
to
smile
and
look
content
wanted
to
clutch
her
again
as
he
had
clutched
her
on
the
top
of
the
rigi
she
had
very
profoundly
disliked
it
she
had
been
able
to
resent
it
there
and
get
loose
but
if
she
were
married
and
he
clutched
could
she
still
resent
she
greatly
feared
not
she
greatly
suspected
now
she
came
to
a
calm
consideration
of
it
that
that
was
what
was
the
matter
with
marriage
it
was
a
series
of
clutchings
her
father
had
no
doubt
realised
this
as
she
was
realising
it
now
and
very
properly
did
like
it
you
could
expect
him
to
that
was
why
he
talk
about
it
in
this
she
was
entirely
at
one
with
him
but
perhaps
herr
dremmel
did
like
it
either
was
she
rather
jumping
at
conclusions
in
imagining
that
he
did
had
he
after
all
clutched
rather
in
anger
up
there
than
in
anything
else
and
what
about
his
earnest
wish
so
often
explained
to
be
left
all
day
locked
up
in
his
laboratory
and
what
about
his
praise
that
very
afternoon
of
chill
in
human
relationships
at
that
moment
her
eye
was
arrested
by
something
white
appearing
slowly
and
with
difficulty
beneath
her
door
she
sat
up
very
straight
and
stared
at
it
watching
its
efforts
to
get
over
and
past
the
edge
of
her
mat
for
an
instant
she
wondered
whether
it
were
not
a
kind
of
insect
ghost
then
she
saw
as
more
of
it
appeared
that
it
was
a
letter
she
held
her
breath
while
it
struggled
in
nobody
had
ever
pushed
a
letter
under
her
door
before
she
grew
happy
instantly
what
her
heart
beat
quite
fast
with
excitement
while
she
waited
to
hear
footsteps
going
away
before
getting
up
to
fetch
it
herr
dremmel
however
must
have
been
in
his
goloshes
objects
from
which
he
was
seldom
separated
for
she
heard
nothing
and
after
a
few
seconds
of
breathless
listening
she
got
up
with
immense
caution
and
went
on
to
the
letter
and
picked
it
up
why
she
thought
pausing
for
a
moment
with
a
sort
of
solemnity
before
opening
it
i
suppose
this
is
my
first
there
was
nothing
on
the
envelope
and
no
signature
and
this
was
what
it
said
little
one
wish
to
tell
you
that
before
going
to
my
room
i
instructed
the
to
order
a
betrothal
cake
properly
iced
and
with
what
is
customary
in
the
matter
of
silver
leaves
to
be
in
the
small
salon
adjoining
the
morning
at
nine
since
no
man
can
be
betrothed
alone
it
will
be
necessary
that
you
should
be
chapter
vi
it
was
a
perturbed
betrothal
there
were
so
many
people
at
it
seven
ladies
besides
ingeborg
appeared
in
the
small
adjoining
the
next
morning
at
nine
what
herr
dremmel
had
done
being
ignorant
which
was
ingeborg
room
and
after
laborious
thought
deciding
that
to
demand
her
number
of
the
later
than
dusk
might
very
conceivably
cast
a
slur
on
her
reputation
young
ladies
being
as
he
well
knew
of
all
living
creatures
the
most
easily
slurred
was
to
write
as
many
copies
of
the
letter
as
there
were
doors
on
her
landing
and
thrust
them
industriously
one
by
one
beneath
each
door
strong
in
the
knowledge
that
she
would
in
this
manner
inevitably
get
one
of
them
he
was
greatly
pleased
with
this
plan
it
seemed
of
a
beautiful
simplicity
and
effectiveness
being
unaware
of
the
context
he
reasoned
no
lady
except
the
right
one
will
be
able
to
guess
what
the
letter
can
possibly
refer
to
she
will
therefore
throw
it
aside
as
an
obvious
mistake
and
think
no
more
about
it
but
the
ladies
did
think
and
none
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
third
floor
except
ascough
who
never
thought
anything
about
anything
having
discovered
that
if
once
you
begin
to
think
there
is
no
end
to
it
and
a
dried
and
brittle
little
man
lately
pensioned
off
by
the
firm
he
had
been
clerk
to
and
taking
his
first
trip
on
the
continent
in
a
condition
of
profound
uninterestedness
threw
it
aside
these
two
did
but
the
seven
ladies
not
only
did
not
throw
it
aside
they
read
it
many
times
and
instead
of
thinking
no
more
about
it
thought
of
nothing
else
even
bawn
who
had
been
a
widow
for
six
months
and
was
heartily
tired
of
it
was
pleased
she
liked
particularly
being
addressed
as
little
one
there
was
a
blindness
about
this
that
suggested
genuine
feeling
she
had
not
been
so
much
pleased
since
her
dear
bawn
now
half
a
year
in
glory
had
told
her
one
day
before
their
marriage
that
he
did
not
care
what
anybody
said
he
maintained
that
she
was
handsome
they
all
thought
the
letter
very
virile
and
that
nothing
could
be
more
gentlemanly
than
its
restraint
four
of
them
expected
a
different
male
member
of
the
party
to
be
waiting
in
the
small
the
remaining
three
expected
ascough
ascough
had
a
caressing
way
with
pats
of
butter
and
the
closing
of
the
doors
of
filled
flys
that
had
before
now
led
him
on
these
tours
into
misapprehensions
he
was
long
since
married
but
had
omitted
to
mention
it
the
ladies
therefore
when
they
arrived
in
the
small
at
nine
did
not
find
ascough
nor
any
of
the
other
four
friends
they
expected
they
found
surprisingly
each
other
and
standing
thick
and
black
near
a
decorated
table
at
the
window
and
scowling
in
a
fresh
astonishment
every
time
the
door
opened
and
another
lady
came
in
that
very
undesirable
the
german
gentleman
each
one
immediately
knew
it
was
ingeborg
who
had
been
written
to
and
that
the
letter
had
gone
astray
each
one
also
thought
she
knew
that
ingeborg
had
not
got
the
letter
and
would
not
come
but
each
one
except
bawn
was
helped
to
cover
up
her
shock
by
being
sure
the
others
did
not
know
of
it
and
the
custom
of
life
lying
heavy
on
them
they
were
able
after
one
little
start
on
first
seeing
herr
dremmel
to
drift
into
the
corners
of
the
room
and
pretend
that
what
they
had
come
for
was
books
except
bawn
bawn
saw
stared
turned
on
her
heel
and
went
out
again
volcanically
and
the
corridor
shook
to
her
departing
footsteps
and
to
the
angry
unintentional
rhymes
she
was
making
aloud
with
words
like
hoax
and
jokes
with
astonishment
and
disgust
herr
dremmel
saw
the
seven
ladies
accumulate
it
was
most
unfortunate
that
on
that
morning
of
all
mornings
the
small
so
invariably
empty
should
be
visited
his
inexperienced
mind
did
not
connect
their
appearance
with
his
letters
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
his
reasoning
as
to
what
they
would
do
on
receiving
them
could
possibly
be
wrong
nor
did
he
as
he
watched
the
door
open
and
shut
seven
times
and
seven
times
admit
the
wrong
woman
guess
that
their
presence
if
ingeborg
came
would
immensely
help
his
betrothal
the
ladies
fingering
dusty
tauchnitzes
and
magazines
and
eyeing
the
table
in
the
window
with
heads
as
much
averted
as
could
be
combined
with
the
seeing
of
it
gradually
found
the
shock
they
had
had
being
soothed
by
the
interest
they
felt
in
what
herr
dremmel
would
do
when
he
realised
that
that
unladylike
miss
bullivant
all
unaware
of
what
was
waiting
for
her
was
not
coming
now
that
they
were
there
they
might
as
well
stay
and
see
the
end
of
it
it
was
really
very
interesting
in
its
way
so
german
so
unlike
thank
goodness
what
english
people
ever
did
would
he
stand
there
all
day
they
wondered
with
that
really
most
improperly
suggestive
cake
so
very
like
a
christening
cake
one
or
two
of
them
sat
down
squarely
on
the
sofas
behind
magazines
round
whose
edges
they
peeped
making
it
clear
to
the
unhappy
man
that
they
at
least
intended
to
stay
there
and
they
all
coughed
a
little
every
now
and
then
in
the
way
a
waiting
congregation
coughs
in
church
then
the
door
was
pushed
open
with
the
jerk
of
somebody
who
is
either
in
a
hurry
or
has
come
to
a
sudden
determination
and
who
should
appear
but
that
miss
bullivant
a
thrill
ran
through
the
seven
ladies
and
they
instantly
became
behind
their
magazines
stiff
with
excitement
chance
what
a
chance
she
had
chanced
to
look
in
it
was
like
a
play
dear
me
thought
each
of
the
seven
and
ingeborg
who
believed
as
lately
as
the
last
moment
on
the
doormat
outside
that
she
had
only
come
in
order
to
tell
herr
dremmel
she
was
not
coming
when
she
saw
the
cake
very
white
and
bridal
on
a
white
cloth
with
white
flowers
in
pots
round
it
and
on
either
side
of
it
a
bottle
with
a
white
ribbon
about
its
neck
and
on
the
other
for
the
sake
of
symmetry
two
glasses
was
staggered
how
could
she
who
so
much
loved
to
please
to
make
happy
cruelly
hurt
him
spoil
his
little
feast
wipe
out
the
glow
the
immense
relief
that
beamed
from
his
face
when
he
saw
her
she
turned
round
quickly
realising
the
presence
of
the
seven
ladies
amazed
she
stared
at
them
mechanically
counting
them
how
could
she
make
him
ridiculous
humiliate
him
before
all
those
women
hesitating
torn
poised
on
the
tip
of
flight
she
stood
there
her
hand
was
on
the
door
to
open
it
again
and
run
but
herr
dremmel
simplicity
came
to
his
help
more
effectually
than
the
cunningest
plans
he
forgot
the
ladies
and
stepping
forward
took
her
hand
in
his
and
quite
simply
kissed
her
forehead
sealing
her
then
and
there
with
the
perfect
frankness
of
his
countrymen
when
engaged
in
legitimate
courtship
as
his
betrothed
he
then
slipped
a
ring
he
wore
on
his
little
finger
on
to
her
thumb
that
being
the
only
bit
of
her
hand
he
could
find
that
it
would
stay
on
and
he
being
free
from
prejudices
in
the
matter
of
fingers
and
the
thing
at
least
so
he
supposed
was
done
ingeborg
in
her
bewilderment
let
these
things
happen
to
her
her
thoughts
as
she
stood
being
betrothed
were
jerking
themselves
into
a
perfect
tangle
of
knots
she
was
astonished
at
the
tricks
life
stoops
to
a
cake
and
the
eyes
of
seven
women
her
whole
future
being
decided
by
a
cake
and
the
eyes
of
seven
women
oh
no
it
could
be
it
was
only
that
she
could
stop
now
impossible
utterly
to
stop
now
she
had
never
dreamed
she
would
find
him
alone
these
women
were
all
witnesses
he
had
kissed
her
before
them
all
his
methods
were
really
overwhelming
suppose
her
father
could
see
her
but
the
kiss
had
been
administered
very
ceremoniously
it
had
been
quite
cooling
such
a
one
as
even
a
bishop
might
feel
justified
in
applying
to
the
brow
of
a
sick
person
or
a
young
child
later
at
a
more
convenient
time
when
the
pathetic
cake
was
out
of
sight
when
these
women
were
out
of
she
would
tell
him
she
had
meant
amazingly
she
found
herself
advancing
towards
the
cake
with
herr
dremmel
and
standing
in
front
of
it
with
him
hand
in
hand
oh
the
people
got
into
who
came
up
to
london
to
dentists
she
now
saw
what
provincial
dentists
were
for
they
kept
you
in
pain
and
pain
kept
you
out
of
mischief
for
the
first
time
she
understood
what
her
spirit
had
till
then
refused
to
accept
the
teaching
so
popular
with
the
bishop
that
pain
was
a
necessary
part
of
the
scheme
of
things
of
course
you
were
safe
so
long
as
you
were
in
pain
in
that
condition
the
very
nearest
you
could
get
to
the
most
seductive
temptation
was
to
glance
at
it
palely
with
a
sick
distaste
and
you
stayed
at
home
and
were
grateful
for
kindnesses
it
was
only
when
you
had
anything
the
matter
with
you
that
you
ran
away
from
your
family
and
went
to
lucerne
and
took
up
with
a
strange
man
positively
to
the
extent
of
letting
him
promise
to
marry
you
somebody
coughed
so
close
behind
her
that
it
made
her
jump
she
turned
round
nervously
herr
dremmel
still
holding
her
hand
and
beheld
the
seven
ladies
flocked
about
her
for
all
the
world
like
seven
bridesmaids
they
had
hastily
consulted
together
in
whispers
while
she
was
being
led
away
to
the
cake
as
to
whether
they
ought
not
to
congratulate
her
their
hearts
were
touched
by
the
respectful
ceremony
with
which
herr
dremmel
had
conducted
his
betrothal
it
had
had
the
solemn
finality
of
a
marriage
and
what
woman
can
look
on
at
a
marriage
unmoved
they
had
agreed
in
whispers
that
this
was
one
of
those
moments
in
which
one
lets
bygones
be
bygones
the
two
at
the
altar
they
meant
at
the
cake
had
no
doubt
said
many
terrible
and
vulgar
tilings
and
had
behaved
in
a
way
no
lady
and
gentleman
would
the
girl
for
instance
openly
admitting
she
had
run
away
from
home
but
what
they
were
doing
now
at
least
was
beyond
reproach
and
by
uniting
two
blacks
were
after
all
in
spite
of
what
people
said
about
its
not
being
possible
going
to
make
one
white
at
any
rate
it
was
charitable
to
hope
so
so
they
cleared
their
throats
and
wished
her
joy
thank
you
said
ingeborg
a
little
faintly
looking
from
one
to
the
other
it
so
kind
of
you
but
they
then
shook
hands
with
herr
dremmel
and
said
they
were
sure
they
wished
him
joy
too
and
he
thanked
them
with
propriety
and
bows
such
a
thing
has
never
happened
on
a
dent
tour
before
oh
no
never
before
at
all
i
sure
said
the
most
elderly
lady
nervously
with
a
number
of
nods
there
is
time
enough
that
what
i
sometimes
think
said
the
young
lady
who
had
hurried
her
companion
away
to
the
sunset
the
evening
before
what
a
week
and
she
stared
at
the
cake
and
frowned
dent
had
a
funeral
once
said
a
square
small
lady
who
kept
her
hands
plunged
in
the
pockets
of
a
grey
jersey
now
miss
jewks
really
protested
the
elderly
lady
one
mention
well
it
was
their
fault
miss
andrews
they
did
to
have
it
i
sure
it
was
a
gentleman
from
gipsy
hill
what
a
beautiful
er
cake
hastily
interrupted
the
elderly
lady
funny
thing
i
sometimes
think
continued
miss
jewks
to
go
for
a
holiday
and
die
instead
those
silver
leaves
said
the
elderly
lady
raising
her
voice
i
call
them
dainty
it
like
a
is
it
said
the
young
lady
of
the
sunset
peering
close
at
it
with
a
face
of
gloom
will
you
not
ingeborg
said
herr
dremmel
calling
her
for
the
first
time
by
her
name
cut
the
cake
and
perhaps
these
ladies
will
do
us
the
honour
of
tasting
it
illustration
will
you
not
ingeborg
said
herr
dremmel
calling
her
for
the
first
time
by
her
name
cut
the
cake
she
did
not
recognise
him
in
this
persistent
ceremoniousness
every
trace
of
his
usual
lax
behaviour
was
gone
his
ease
and
familiarity
of
speech
and
he
was
as
stiff
and
correct
and
grave
as
if
he
were
laying
a
foundation
stone
or
opening
a
museum
they
were
the
manners
though
she
did
not
know
it
which
all
germans
are
trained
to
produce
on
public
occasions
oh
thank
you
oh
you
really
very
kind
oh
thank
you
very
much
i
sure
there
was
a
murmur
of
awkward
and
reluctant
thanks
the
seven
ladies
were
not
at
all
certain
that
their
cordiality
ought
to
stretch
as
far
as
cake
they
had
been
moved
by
an
impulse
that
did
honour
to
their
womanliness
to
offer
congratulations
but
they
did
not
for
all
that
forget
the
dreadful
things
the
couple
had
constantly
been
heard
talking
about
and
the
many
clear
proofs
it
had
provided
that
it
was
what
tours
were
accustomed
to
describe
as
no
class
and
though
they
all
liked
cake
and
were
getting
steadily
hungrier
as
the
dent
week
drew
to
its
close
they
were
doubtful
as
to
the
social
wisdom
of
eating
it
it
would
be
very
unpleasant
if
these
people
encouraged
were
later
on
to
presume
if
they
were
to
try
to
use
the
eaten
cake
as
a
weapon
for
forcing
their
way
into
english
society
if
in
a
word
when
the
tour
got
back
to
england
they
were
to
want
to
call
so
they
took
the
cake
reluctantly
that
ingeborg
in
a
sort
of
dream
cut
and
offered
them
and
with
even
more
reluctance
they
sipped
the
wine
in
which
the
german
gentleman
requested
them
to
drink
the
newly
betrothed
couple
health
but
said
ingeborg
trying
to
rouse
herself
even
at
this
eleventh
hour
true
there
are
not
enough
glasses
i
will
ring
for
more
was
the
way
herr
dremmel
finished
her
sentence
for
her
the
immense
official
promptness
of
him
she
felt
numbed
and
when
the
glasses
were
brought
there
was
another
ceremony
a
clinking
of
herr
dremmel
glass
with
each
glass
in
turn
his
heels
together
as
in
the
days
of
his
soldiering
his
body
stiff
and
his
face
a
miracle
of
solemnity
and
before
drinking
he
made
a
speech
the
asti
held
high
in
front
of
him
in
which
he
thanked
the
ladies
for
their
good
wishes
on
behalf
of
his
betrothed
miss
ingeborg
bullivant
whose
virtues
he
dwelt
upon
singly
and
at
length
in
resounding
periods
before
proceeding
to
assure
those
present
of
his
firm
resolve
to
prove
by
the
devotion
of
the
rest
of
his
life
the
extremity
of
his
gratitude
for
the
striking
proof
she
had
given
before
them
all
of
her
confidence
in
him
and
every
sentence
seemed
to
set
another
and
a
heavier
seal
on
her
as
a
creature
undoubtedly
bound
to
marry
him
dimly
she
began
to
realise
something
of
the
steely
grip
of
a
german
engagement
she
wondered
whether
there
were
any
more
room
left
on
her
forehead
for
further
seals
she
felt
that
it
must
be
covered
with
great
red
things
scrawled
over
with
the
inscription
dremmel
well
she
was
after
all
not
a
parcel
to
be
picked
up
and
carried
away
by
the
first
person
who
found
her
lying
about
and
the
minute
she
was
alone
with
him
she
would
she
tell
him
that
what
she
had
really
come
down
for
though
appearances
were
certainly
by
this
time
rather
against
her
was
to
refuse
him
she
would
be
as
gentle
as
possible
but
she
would
be
plain
and
firm
the
minute
these
women
left
them
alone
she
would
tell
him
with
a
start
she
saw
that
the
women
were
leaving
them
alone
and
that
the
minute
had
come
she
wanted
them
not
to
go
she
wanted
to
keep
them
there
at
any
cost
she
even
made
a
step
after
them
as
the
last
one
nodding
to
the
end
went
out
and
shut
the
door
but
herr
dremmel
still
had
hold
of
her
hand
when
the
door
had
finally
shut
she
turned
to
him
quickly
her
head
was
thrown
back
her
eyes
were
full
of
a
courage
but
you
know
she
began
determined
to
clear
things
up
however
much
it
might
hurt
them
both
and
again
he
promptly
finished
her
sentence
for
her
this
time
by
enfolding
her
in
his
arms
and
kissing
her
with
a
largeness
and
abundance
which
no
bishop
her
mind
flashed
as
her
body
stood
stiff
with
surprise
and
horror
could
possibly
approve
she
felt
engulfed
she
felt
she
must
be
disappearing
altogether
he
seemed
infinitely
capacious
and
soft
oh
but
i
ca
i
wo
oh
stop
oh
stop
it
a
mistake
she
tried
to
get
out
in
gasps
my
little
wife
was
all
the
notice
herr
dremmel
took
of
that
chapter
vii
it
was
raining
at
redchester
when
ingeborg
got
out
at
the
station
a
week
and
a
day
after
she
left
it
the
soft
persistent
fine
rain
hardly
more
than
a
mist
peculiar
to
that
corner
of
england
the
lawns
in
the
gardens
she
passed
as
her
fly
crawled
up
the
hill
were
incredibly
green
the
leaves
of
the
lilac
bushes
glistened
with
wet
each
tulip
was
a
cup
of
water
the
roads
were
chocolate
and
a
thick
grey
blanket
of
cloud
hung
warm
over
the
town
tucking
it
in
all
round
and
keeping
out
any
draught
that
might
bite
and
sting
the
inhabitants
she
thought
into
real
living
the
porter
told
her
it
was
fine
growing
weather
and
she
wondered
stupidly
why
after
the
years
she
had
had
of
the
sort
of
thing
she
had
had
not
grown
then
more
thoroughly
herself
a
retired
colonel
she
knew
she
knew
all
the
retired
colonels
waved
his
umbrella
and
shouted
a
genial
inquiry
after
her
toothache
and
she
looked
at
him
with
a
dead
ungrateful
eye
a
passing
postman
touched
his
cap
and
she
turned
the
other
way
the
same
sensible
female
figures
she
had
seen
all
her
life
draped
in
the
same
sensible
mackintoshes
bowed
and
smiled
and
she
pretended
she
had
seen
them
everybody
in
fact
behaved
as
though
she
were
still
good
which
was
distressing
embarrassing
and
productive
of
an
overwhelming
desire
to
shut
her
eyes
and
hide
there
were
the
shops
with
the
things
in
the
windows
unchanged
since
she
left
nine
days
ago
the
same
ancient
novelties
nobody
ever
bought
the
same
flies
creeping
over
the
same
buns
there
was
the
her
had
come
from
his
windows
full
of
more
of
them
endless
supplies
for
endless
dieted
daughters
vegetarians
in
literature
she
called
them
to
herself
forcibly
vegetabled
vegetarians
and
there
was
the
silversmith
who
provided
the
bishop
with
the
crosses
after
a
good
florentine
pattern
he
presented
to
those
of
his
confirmation
candidates
who
were
the
daughters
in
the
diocese
of
the
great
the
duke
daughter
had
one
the
daughter
had
one
on
this
principle
ingeborg
herself
had
been
given
one
and
wore
it
continually
night
and
day
as
her
father
expected
under
her
dress
where
it
bruised
her
it
was
pleasant
to
her
father
to
be
able
to
recollect
in
the
stress
and
dust
of
much
in
his
work
that
was
unrefreshing
how
there
was
a
yearly
increasing
though
severely
sifted
number
of
gentle
virgin
blouses
belonging
to
the
best
families
beneath
which
lay
and
rhythmically
heaved
this
silver
reminder
of
the
bishop
and
of
her
god
father
ingeborg
said
after
she
had
worn
hers
for
a
week
may
i
take
my
cross
off
at
night
why
ingeborg
he
had
inquired
adding
quietly
did
our
saviour
no
but
you
see
when
one
turns
round
in
one
sleep
it
sticks
into
one
sticks
ingeborg
the
bishop
said
gently
raising
his
eyebrows
at
such
an
expression
applied
to
such
an
object
yes
and
i
getting
awfully
bruised
she
was
still
in
the
schoolroom
and
still
saying
awfully
by
his
stripes
we
are
healed
said
the
bishop
shutting
up
the
conversation
as
one
shuts
up
a
book
in
spite
of
the
wet
warmth
she
shivered
as
the
silversmith
window
reminded
her
of
this
it
had
happened
years
ago
but
even
farther
back
as
far
back
as
she
could
remember
every
time
she
had
asked
leave
of
her
father
to
do
anything
it
had
been
refused
and
refused
with
bits
of
bible
which
was
so
peculiarly
silencing
and
now
here
she
was
about
to
face
him
covered
with
the
leaves
she
had
not
asked
for
at
all
but
had
so
tremendously
taken
and
going
to
ask
the
most
tremendous
one
of
all
the
leave
to
marry
herr
dremmel
for
that
was
how
the
last
two
days
of
her
dent
tour
had
been
spent
in
being
openly
engaged
to
herr
dremmel
she
had
found
her
attempts
to
explain
that
she
was
not
so
really
availed
nothing
against
his
conviction
that
she
was
and
public
opinion
the
public
opinion
of
the
whole
tour
also
never
doubted
but
that
she
was
had
not
seven
of
its
most
reliable
members
actually
seen
her
in
the
act
of
becoming
it
in
fact
it
not
only
did
not
doubt
it
it
was
sternly
determined
that
she
should
be
engaged
whether
she
liked
it
or
not
it
was
the
least
the
tour
felt
that
she
could
do
so
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
now
but
to
face
the
bishop
she
felt
cold
no
amount
of
the
familiar
moist
stuffiness
could
warm
her
vainly
she
tried
to
sit
up
to
be
proud
and
brave
to
recapture
something
at
least
of
the
courage
that
had
seemed
so
easy
just
at
the
end
in
switzerland
with
herr
dremmel
to
laugh
at
her
doubts
her
head
would
droop
and
her
hands
and
feet
were
like
stones
it
was
the
place
the
place
she
thought
the
hypnotic
effect
of
it
of
her
old
environment
the
whole
of
redchester
was
heavy
with
recollections
of
past
obediences
not
once
had
she
ever
in
redchester
even
dreamt
of
rebellion
she
had
questioned
latterly
in
the
remoter
and
less
filial
corners
of
her
heart
but
she
had
never
so
much
as
thought
of
rebellion
and
the
moment
she
got
away
out
of
sight
and
hearing
of
home
things
she
knew
here
were
wicked
had
appeared
to
be
quite
good
and
extremely
natural
how
strange
that
was
and
how
strange
that
now
she
was
back
everything
was
beginning
to
seem
wicked
again
what
was
a
poor
wretch
to
do
she
asked
herself
with
sudden
passion
confronted
by
these
shuffling
standards
that
behaved
as
if
they
were
dancing
a
quadrille
this
was
the
place
in
which
for
years
her
conscience
had
been
cockered
to
size
and
delicacy
and
though
it
had
become
temporarily
tough
in
herr
dremmel
company
she
felt
it
relapsing
with
every
turn
of
the
wheels
more
and
more
into
its
ancient
softness
yet
she
undoubtedly
and
frightened
or
not
had
to
tell
her
father
what
she
had
done
she
had
got
to
be
brave
and
if
needs
be
she
had
got
to
defy
she
was
bound
to
herr
dremmel
he
had
only
gone
home
to
set
his
house
in
order
and
then
he
announced
she
meanwhile
having
prepared
the
bishop
he
was
coming
to
redchester
to
marry
her
prepared
the
bishop
she
shivered
herr
dremmel
had
tried
to
marry
her
in
lucerne
but
the
swiss
it
seemed
would
not
be
hurried
so
that
here
she
was
and
within
the
next
few
hours
she
was
going
to
have
to
prepare
the
bishop
she
shut
her
eyes
and
thought
of
herr
dremmel
of
robert
as
she
was
was
learning
to
call
him
with
all
her
heart
she
liked
him
and
he
had
been
so
kind
when
he
found
she
really
disliked
being
engulfed
in
embraces
and
had
restricted
his
exhibitions
of
affection
to
the
kissing
of
her
hand
telling
her
he
could
very
well
wait
till
later
on
sure
that
she
would
after
marriage
warm
as
he
had
explained
to
her
on
the
rigi
all
women
did
to
a
just
appreciation
of
the
value
of
the
caresses
of
an
honest
man
he
had
also
produced
a
number
of
german
from
some
hitherto
fallow
corner
of
his
mind
and
garnished
his
conversation
with
them
in
a
way
that
made
her
who
nourished
as
she
had
been
on
the
noble
language
of
the
bible
and
the
was
instantly
responsive
to
the
charm
of
words
laugh
and
glow
with
pleasure
she
was
his
little
heart
his
little
tiny
treasure
his
little
sugar
lamb
a
dozen
little
sweet
diminished
german
things
translated
straight
away
just
as
they
were
into
english
the
freshness
of
it
the
freshness
of
being
admired
and
petted
after
the
economies
in
these
directions
practised
in
her
home
and
his
ring
at
that
very
moment
dangled
beneath
her
dress
on
the
same
chain
as
her
father
cross
yes
she
was
bound
to
him
duty
she
perceived
could
be
a
very
blessed
thing
sometimes
if
it
protected
one
from
some
other
duty
it
was
herr
dremmel
now
who
had
become
her
duty
she
put
up
her
hand
to
get
courage
by
feeling
the
ring
for
her
spirit
was
fainting
within
her
she
had
just
caught
sight
of
the
cathedral
the
ring
had
been
slung
on
the
chain
alongside
the
confirmation
cross
because
it
was
impossible
to
wear
it
on
her
thumb
and
out
there
in
switzerland
where
one
was
simple
it
had
seemed
a
most
natural
and
obvious
place
to
put
it
yet
now
as
the
fly
rattled
over
the
cobbles
of
the
close
and
the
familiar
cathedral
rose
before
her
like
a
menace
she
hung
her
head
and
greatly
doubted
but
what
the
juxtaposition
was
wicked
nobody
was
on
the
doorstep
when
she
arrived
beneath
the
great
cedar
that
spread
its
shade
an
intensified
bit
of
dripping
gloom
where
all
was
gloom
and
dripping
across
from
the
lawn
to
the
palace
entrance
except
the
butler
whose
black
clothes
struck
her
instantly
as
very
neat
and
smooth
and
his
underling
a
youth
kept
carefully
a
little
on
the
side
of
a
suitable
episcopal
shabbiness
she
had
telegraphed
her
train
from
paddington
but
that
of
course
was
no
reason
why
any
one
should
be
on
the
doorstep
it
was
she
whose
business
lay
with
doorsteps
when
people
arrived
or
left
she
was
the
one
who
welcomed
and
who
sped
and
since
she
could
not
welcome
herself
there
was
nobody
there
to
do
it
she
stole
a
nervous
look
at
wilson
as
he
helped
her
out
but
his
face
was
a
blank
the
boy
on
her
other
side
had
an
expression
she
thought
as
though
under
happier
conditions
he
might
have
let
himself
go
in
a
smirk
and
she
turned
her
eyes
away
with
a
little
sick
feeling
did
they
know
already
all
of
them
that
she
had
left
her
aunt
a
week
ago
but
indeed
that
seemed
a
small
thing
now
compared
with
the
things
she
had
done
since
i
a
dead
girl
thought
ingeborg
as
she
passed
beneath
her
porch
the
servants
brought
in
her
luggage
off
which
in
her
newness
at
deceit
she
had
not
thought
to
scrape
the
continental
labels
and
she
crossed
the
hall
treading
on
the
dim
splashes
of
lovely
blurred
colour
that
fell
from
the
vast
stained
glass
windows
on
to
the
stone
flags
of
its
floor
it
was
the
noblest
hall
as
bare
of
stuffs
and
carpets
as
the
cathedral
itself
and
she
looked
more
than
insignificant
going
across
it
to
the
carved
oak
door
that
opened
into
the
wide
panelled
passage
leading
to
the
a
little
figure
braced
to
a
miserable
courage
the
smallest
thing
to
be
going
to
defy
powers
of
which
this
magnificence
was
only
one
of
the
expressions
her
mother
was
as
usual
on
her
sofa
near
a
fire
whose
heat
that
warm
day
was
mitigated
by
the
windows
being
wide
open
beside
her
was
her
own
particular
table
with
the
usual
flowers
needlework
devotional
books
and
biographies
of
good
men
it
was
difficult
to
believe
her
mother
had
got
off
that
sofa
nine
times
to
go
to
bed
had
dressed
and
undressed
and
had
meals
of
them
counted
ingeborg
mechanically
while
she
looked
about
for
the
bishop
if
you
excluded
the
before
breakfast
tea
if
you
did
since
she
saw
her
last
so
immovable
did
she
appear
so
exactly
in
the
same
position
and
composed
into
the
same
lines
as
she
had
been
nine
days
before
the
room
was
full
of
the
singing
of
thrushes
quite
deafeningly
full
as
she
opened
the
door
for
the
windows
gave
straight
into
the
green
and
soppy
garden
and
it
was
a
day
of
many
worms
judith
was
making
tea
as
far
away
from
the
fire
as
she
could
get
and
there
was
no
sign
of
the
bishop
is
that
you
ingeborg
said
her
mother
turning
her
face
grown
pale
with
years
of
being
shut
up
to
the
door
ingeborg
mother
had
found
the
sofa
as
other
people
find
salvation
she
was
not
she
had
simply
discovered
in
it
a
refuge
and
a
very
present
help
in
all
the
troubles
and
turmoil
of
life
and
in
especial
a
shield
and
buckler
when
it
came
to
dealing
with
the
bishop
it
is
not
easy
for
the
married
she
had
found
when
first
casting
about
for
one
to
hit
on
a
refuge
from
each
other
that
shall
be
honourable
to
both
in
a
moment
of
insight
she
perceived
the
sofa
here
was
a
blameless
object
that
would
separate
her
entirely
from
duties
and
responsibilities
of
every
sort
it
was
respectable
it
was
unassailably
effective
it
was
not
included
in
the
commandments
all
she
had
to
do
was
to
cling
to
it
and
nobody
could
make
her
do
or
be
anything
she
accordingly
got
on
to
it
and
had
stayed
there
ever
since
mysteriously
frail
an
object
of
solicitude
and
sympathy
a
being
before
whose
helplessness
the
most
aggressive
or
aggrieved
husband
must
needs
be
helpless
too
and
she
had
gradually
acquired
the
sofa
look
and
was
now
very
definitely
a
slightly
plaintive
but
persistently
patient
christian
lady
is
that
you
ingeborg
she
said
turning
her
head
yes
mother
said
ingeborg
hesitating
in
spite
of
herself
on
the
threshold
she
looked
round
anxiously
but
the
bishop
was
not
lurking
anywhere
in
the
big
room
come
in
dear
and
shut
the
door
you
see
the
windows
are
open
judith
glanced
up
at
her
a
moment
from
her
and
did
not
move
even
in
the
midst
of
her
terrors
ingeborg
was
astonished
after
not
having
seen
it
for
a
while
at
her
loveliness
she
seemed
to
have
taken
the
sodden
greys
of
the
afternoon
the
dulness
and
the
gathering
dusk
and
made
out
of
their
gloom
the
one
perfect
background
for
her
beauty
we
thought
you
would
have
written
said
bullivant
putting
her
cheek
in
a
position
convenient
for
the
kiss
that
was
to
be
applied
to
it
i
i
telegraphed
said
ingeborg
applying
the
kiss
yes
dear
but
only
about
your
train
i
thought
that
was
enough
but
ingeborg
dear
such
a
great
occasion
one
of
great
occasions
of
life
we
did
expect
a
little
notice
did
we
judith
notice
said
ingeborg
faintly
your
father
was
wounded
dear
he
thought
it
showed
so
little
real
love
for
your
parents
and
your
sister
but
said
ingeborg
looking
from
one
to
the
other
we
wrote
to
you
at
once
directly
we
knew
did
we
judith
of
course
said
judith
ingeborg
stood
flushing
and
turning
pale
had
one
of
the
dent
tour
people
somehow
found
out
where
she
lived
and
written
about
her
engagement
and
the
impossible
had
happened
and
they
were
going
to
mind
was
it
possible
did
they
know
and
were
taking
it
like
this
if
only
she
had
called
at
her
aunt
house
on
the
way
to
paddington
and
got
the
letters
what
miserable
hours
of
terror
she
would
have
been
spared
but
she
began
then
the
immense
relief
of
it
suddenly
flooded
her
whole
being
with
a
delicious
warm
softness
they
did
know
somehow
and
a
miracle
had
happened
oh
how
god
was
she
dropped
on
her
knees
by
the
sofa
and
began
to
kiss
her
hand
which
surprised
bullivant
and
indeed
it
is
a
foreign
trick
picked
up
mostly
by
those
who
go
abroad
mother
she
said
are
you
really
pleased
about
it
you
do
mind
then
mind
said
bullivant
oh
how
glad
how
glad
i
am
and
father
what
does
he
say
does
he
does
mind
mind
repeated
bullivant
father
is
very
pleased
i
think
said
judith
with
what
in
one
less
lovely
would
have
been
a
slight
pursing
of
the
lips
and
she
twisted
a
remarkable
diamond
ring
she
was
wearing
straight
father
is
pleased
echoed
ingeborg
quite
by
the
amount
and
quality
of
these
reliefs
i
must
say
i
think
it
is
really
of
your
dear
father
to
be
pleased
when
he
loses
began
bullivant
oh
yes
yes
interrupted
the
overcome
ingeborg
it
a
wonder
a
wonder
of
god
ingeborg
dear
her
mother
gently
rebuked
for
this
was
excess
and
judith
looked
still
more
what
would
have
been
a
little
pursed
in
any
other
woman
when
he
loses
then
resumed
bullivant
with
the
plaintive
determination
of
one
who
considers
it
the
least
she
may
expect
as
a
mother
to
be
allowed
to
finish
her
sentences
so
much
yes
yes
assented
ingeborg
eagerly
whose
appreciation
of
her
parents
attitude
was
so
warm
that
she
almost
felt
she
must
stay
and
bask
in
its
urbanity
forever
and
not
go
away
after
all
to
the
bleak
distance
of
east
prussia
your
father
loses
not
a
daughter
continued
bullivant
but
a
year
of
his
income
would
one
call
it
his
income
inquired
judith
politely
but
yet
if
one
could
suspect
a
being
with
an
angel
face
of
such
a
thing
with
some
slight
annoyance
i
thought
our
grandmother
judith
dear
the
a
year
your
grandmother
left
to
each
of
you
was
only
to
be
yours
when
you
married
explained
bullivant
also
with
some
slight
annoyance
beneath
her
patience
till
you
married
it
was
to
be
mine
your
father
i
mean
of
course
and
if
you
never
did
marry
it
would
have
been
mine
i
mean
his
always
ingeborg
had
heard
of
her
swedish
grandmother
will
but
had
long
ago
forgotten
it
marriage
being
remote
and
money
never
of
any
interest
to
her
who
had
no
occasions
for
spending
now
her
heart
bounded
with
yet
more
thankfulness
what
a
comfort
it
would
be
to
robert
how
it
would
help
him
in
his
research
extraordinary
that
she
should
have
forgotten
it
when
he
told
her
of
his
stipend
of
five
thousand
marks
it
was
in
english
money
he
explained
and
there
was
the
house
and
land
free
most
of
which
went
in
his
experiments
but
what
was
left
being
ample
he
said
for
the
living
purposes
of
reasonable
beings
if
they
approached
it
in
a
proper
spirit
it
all
depending
he
said
on
whether
they
approached
it
in
a
proper
spirit
and
after
all
he
had
added
triumphantly
throwing
out
his
chest
just
as
she
was
about
to
inquire
what
the
proper
spirit
was
no
man
can
call
me
to
think
she
had
forgotten
the
substantial
help
she
was
going
to
be
able
to
bring
him
the
full
splendour
of
her
father
generosity
in
being
pleased
at
her
engagement
was
now
revealed
to
her
the
relief
of
it
the
glad
warm
relief
so
must
one
feel
who
is
born
again
all
new
all
clean
from
old
mistakes
and
fears
she
felt
lifted
up
extraordinarily
happy
extraordinarily
good
more
in
harmony
with
providence
and
the
bible
than
she
had
been
since
childhood
she
would
have
been
willing
and
indeed
found
it
perfectly
natural
to
kneel
down
with
her
mother
and
judith
then
and
there
and
say
prayers
together
out
loud
she
would
have
been
willing
on
the
crest
of
her
wave
of
gratefulness
quite
readily
to
give
up
herr
dremmel
in
return
for
the
family
immense
kindness
in
not
asking
her
to
give
him
up
she
had
felt
nothing
like
this
exaltation
before
in
her
life
this
complete
being
in
harmony
with
the
infinite
this
confidence
in
the
inherent
goodness
of
things
except
on
the
afternoon
her
tooth
was
pulled
out
oh
she
exclaimed
laying
her
cheek
on
her
mother
hand
oh
i
do
you
like
robert
robert
said
bullivant
and
at
the
there
was
a
sudden
silence
among
the
cups
as
though
they
were
holding
their
breath
his
name
robert
said
ingeborg
still
with
her
cheek
on
her
hand
her
eyes
shut
her
face
a
vision
of
snuggest
safest
contentment
what
robert
ingeborg
inquired
bullivant
shifting
her
position
to
stare
down
more
conveniently
at
her
daughter
herr
dremmel
it
his
christian
name
he
got
to
one
you
know
said
ingeborg
still
with
her
eyes
shut
in
the
blissfulness
of
perfect
confidence
herr
who
said
bullivant
a
sharper
note
of
life
in
her
voice
than
there
had
been
for
years
here
your
father
she
added
quickly
hastily
composing
herself
into
the
lines
of
the
unassailable
invalid
again
as
the
door
opened
and
the
bishop
came
in
ingeborg
jumped
up
oh
father
she
cried
running
to
him
with
the
entire
want
of
shyness
one
may
conceive
in
the
newly
washed
and
forgiven
soul
when
it
first
arrives
in
heaven
and
meets
its
maker
and
knows
there
are
going
to
be
no
more
misunderstandings
for
ever
how
been
and
she
kissed
him
so
fervently
in
a
room
gone
so
silent
that
the
kiss
sounded
quite
loud
the
bishop
was
nettled
was
he
then
at
any
time
not
good
his
daughter
excessive
gratitude
really
almost
noisy
gratitude
for
what
after
all
had
been
inevitable
the
permission
to
go
up
to
london
and
place
herself
in
the
hands
of
a
dentist
suggested
that
humaneness
on
his
part
came
to
her
as
a
surprise
he
did
feel
he
had
been
good
to
let
her
go
but
he
also
felt
he
would
have
been
not
good
if
he
had
not
let
her
go
certainly
redchester
opinion
would
have
condemned
him
as
cruel
even
if
he
himself
who
knew
all
the
circumstances
was
not
able
to
think
so
what
had
really
been
cruel
was
the
terrible
muddle
his
papers
and
letters
had
got
into
owing
to
her
prolonged
absence
grave
dislocations
had
taken
place
in
the
joints
of
his
engagements
several
with
results
and
all
because
he
could
not
help
feeling
ingeborg
in
spite
of
precept
and
example
did
not
in
her
earlier
years
use
her
toothbrush
with
regularity
and
conscientiousness
manifestly
she
did
not
or
how
could
she
have
needed
nine
enormous
days
to
be
set
in
repair
he
himself
who
regarded
his
body
as
a
holy
temple
which
was
the
one
solution
of
the
body
question
that
at
all
approached
satisfactoriness
and
had
accordingly
brushed
his
teeth
from
the
point
of
view
of
their
being
pillars
of
a
sacred
edifice
after
every
meal
for
forty
years
had
never
had
a
toothache
in
his
life
let
us
hope
now
ingeborg
he
said
reflecting
on
the
instance
she
had
provided
of
the
modern
inversion
of
the
mosaic
law
which
visited
the
sins
of
the
fathers
on
the
children
the
original
arrangement
the
bishop
felt
being
considerably
healthier
and
gently
putting
her
away
in
order
to
go
over
to
the
where
he
stood
holding
out
his
hand
for
the
cup
judith
hastened
to
place
in
it
let
us
now
hope
now
you
have
had
your
lesson
that
in
future
you
will
remember
cleanliness
is
next
to
godliness
and
this
seemed
to
ingeborg
an
answer
so
surprising
that
she
could
only
stare
at
him
with
her
mouth
fallen
a
little
open
there
where
he
had
left
her
in
the
middle
of
the
carpet
but
the
bishop
had
not
done
he
went
on
to
say
another
thing
that
surprised
her
still
more
nay
smote
her
cold
shook
her
to
her
foundations
he
said
after
a
pause
during
which
the
silence
in
the
room
was
remarkable
his
back
turned
to
her
while
at
the
he
carefully
selected
the
particular
piece
of
bread
and
butter
he
intended
to
eat
and
pray
ingeborg
why
did
you
not
write
the
moment
you
heard
from
us
and
congratulate
your
sister
on
her
engagement
chapter
viii
ingeborg
was
dumb
her
father
question
was
like
a
blow
shocking
her
back
to
consciousness
the
warm
dream
that
all
was
well
that
she
was
understood
that
there
was
love
and
kindliness
for
her
at
home
after
all
and
welcome
and
encouragement
the
warm
feeling
of
stretching
herself
in
her
family
kind
lap
confident
that
it
would
hold
her
up
and
not
spill
her
out
on
to
the
floor
was
gone
in
a
flash
she
was
hit
awake
hit
out
of
her
brief
delicious
sleep
her
family
had
not
got
a
lap
but
it
had
an
entirely
unprepared
mind
and
into
that
unprepared
mind
she
had
tumbled
the
name
of
dremmel
judith
engaged
she
stammered
faintly
on
the
bishop
wheeling
round
cup
in
hand
to
examine
into
the
cause
of
her
prolonged
silence
your
incredulity
is
not
very
flattering
to
your
sister
he
said
and
judith
eyelashes
as
she
concentrated
her
gaze
on
the
teapot
were
alone
sufficiently
lovely
the
curved
soft
things
to
make
incredulity
simply
silly
bullivant
avoided
all
speech
and
clung
to
her
sofa
it
so
sudden
faltered
ingeborg
much
may
happen
in
a
week
said
the
bishop
yes
murmured
ingeborg
who
knew
that
terribly
too
we
never
can
tell
what
a
day
may
bring
forth
said
the
bishop
and
ingeborg
deeply
convinced
drooped
her
head
acquiescent
no
man
began
the
bishop
habit
being
strong
within
him
knoweth
the
hour
when
the
bridegroom
but
he
stopped
recollecting
that
ingeborg
was
not
engaged
and
therefore
could
not
with
propriety
be
talked
to
of
bridegrooms
instead
he
inquired
again
why
she
had
not
written
and
eyeing
her
searchingly
asked
himself
if
it
were
possible
that
a
child
of
his
could
be
base
enough
to
envy
i
did
get
the
letters
said
ingeborg
her
head
drooping
you
did
not
that
is
very
strange
your
mother
wrote
at
once
let
me
see
it
was
on
friday
it
happened
it
friday
was
it
not
judith
ought
to
know
judith
blushed
obediently
and
is
tuesday
ample
time
ample
time
my
dear
he
said
turning
to
his
wife
who
at
once
twitched
into
a
condition
of
yet
further
relaxed
defencelessness
do
you
think
it
possible
your
letter
was
not
posted
quite
herbert
murmured
bullivant
closing
her
eyes
and
endeavouring
to
imagine
herself
unconscious
ah
then
that
it
that
it
wilson
is
growing
careless
this
last
week
there
have
been
repeated
negligences
you
will
make
inquiries
ingeborg
and
tell
him
what
i
have
said
yes
father
and
you
will
discharge
him
if
he
goes
on
like
this
yes
father
unfaithful
servant
unfaithful
servant
he
that
is
unfaithful
in
a
few
things
the
bishop
frowning
at
it
took
a
second
piece
of
bread
and
butter
and
went
over
to
the
hearthrug
where
he
stood
from
force
of
habit
in
spite
of
the
warmth
of
the
day
drinking
his
tea
and
becoming
vaguely
and
increasingly
irritated
by
the
action
of
the
fire
behind
him
then
he
said
looking
at
ingeborg
you
know
nothing
about
it
she
shook
her
head
she
was
the
oddest
figure
in
the
middle
of
the
splendid
old
room
untidy
her
face
white
with
fatigue
her
hat
crooked
judith
glanced
at
her
every
now
and
then
but
it
was
impossible
at
any
time
to
tell
what
the
delicate
white
rose
at
the
was
thinking
so
impossible
that
the
young
men
who
clustered
round
her
like
bees
when
they
first
saw
her
gave
it
up
and
went
on
presently
to
more
communicative
flowers
the
local
duchess
had
hoped
her
would
marry
him
a
creature
so
lovely
so
entirely
respectable
with
that
nice
bishop
for
a
father
and
so
happily
adapted
in
the
perfection
of
her
proportions
for
the
successful
production
of
further
dukes
and
she
pointed
out
various
aspects
of
the
girl
exquisiteness
to
her
son
and
told
him
he
would
have
the
most
beautiful
wife
in
england
but
the
young
man
after
a
reproachful
look
at
his
mother
for
supposing
he
could
have
missed
noticing
even
the
humblest
approach
to
a
pretty
woman
let
alone
judith
bullivant
said
he
did
want
to
marry
a
picture
but
something
that
was
alive
and
anyhow
something
that
talked
she
right
enough
of
course
he
remarked
and
i
like
looking
at
her
i
be
blind
if
i
did
but
lord
dull
the
girl
has
got
a
word
to
say
for
herself
i
never
met
any
woman
who
looked
so
ripping
and
then
somehow
was
she
wo
talk
she
wo
he
almost
wailed
she
ai
got
the
remotest
resemblance
to
anything
approaching
in
her
you
might
end
by
being
thankful
for
that
said
his
mother
he
would
not
however
be
persuaded
and
went
his
way
and
married
as
the
duchess
had
feared
a
young
lady
from
the
halls
a
young
lady
nimble
not
only
of
toes
but
of
wits
nimble
that
is
to
say
as
he
proudly
pointed
out
to
his
mother
at
both
ends
with
whom
he
lived
in
great
contentment
for
she
amused
him
which
is
much
i
have
not
observed
you
offer
any
congratulations
ingeborg
said
the
bishop
becoming
more
and
more
displeased
by
her
strange
behaviour
and
not
at
all
liking
her
crumpled
and
forlorn
appearance
he
again
thought
of
envy
but
that
alone
could
not
crumple
clothes
and
yet
your
sister
he
said
getting
a
little
further
away
from
the
fire
which
had
begun
to
scorch
him
unpleasantly
is
to
be
the
wife
of
the
master
the
master
repeated
ingeborg
stupidly
for
a
moment
her
tormented
brain
supposed
judith
must
be
going
to
be
a
nun
there
is
only
one
master
said
the
bishop
in
his
stateliest
manner
everybody
knows
that
the
master
of
ananias
ingeborg
knew
this
was
a
great
thing
the
master
of
ananias
the
most
celebrated
of
oxford
colleges
was
in
every
way
except
perhaps
that
of
age
desirable
but
what
was
age
when
it
came
to
all
the
other
desirabilities
her
father
had
rebuked
her
once
for
speaking
of
him
as
old
abbot
and
had
informed
her
the
master
was
only
sixty
and
that
everybody
was
sixty
that
is
said
the
bishop
everybody
of
any
sense
he
was
not
a
widower
he
was
pleasant
to
look
at
in
a
shaven
way
he
was
brilliantly
erudite
and
extremely
well
off
apart
from
his
handsome
salary
one
of
the
handsomest
salaries
in
the
gift
of
the
crown
several
years
before
when
judith
was
still
invisible
in
a
pinafore
he
had
stayed
at
the
palace
it
was
then
ingeborg
spoke
of
him
as
old
and
had
been
treated
by
her
father
with
every
attention
and
respect
he
had
on
that
occasion
seemed
glad
to
go
now
it
appeared
he
had
been
again
and
must
have
fallen
immediately
and
overwhelmingly
in
love
with
judith
for
his
short
visit
to
bridge
the
distance
between
a
first
acquaintance
and
an
engagement
who
however
knew
better
than
herself
how
quickly
such
distances
can
be
bridged
she
wanted
to
go
and
kiss
judith
and
say
sweet
things
to
her
but
her
feet
seemed
unable
to
move
she
wanted
to
congratulate
everybody
with
all
her
heart
if
only
they
would
be
kind
and
congratulate
her
a
little
too
for
judith
had
heard
what
she
said
before
her
father
came
in
and
her
mother
had
heard
it
and
the
room
was
heavy
with
the
uttered
name
of
dremmel
she
looked
round
at
them
her
father
waiting
for
her
to
show
at
least
ordinary
decency
and
feeling
judith
so
safe
in
the
family
approval
so
entirely
clear
from
hidden
things
her
mother
lying
with
closed
eyes
and
expressionless
face
and
she
suddenly
felt
intolerably
alone
oh
oh
she
cried
holding
out
her
hands
does
anybody
love
me
this
was
worse
than
her
toothache
her
family
had
endured
much
during
those
days
but
at
least
there
was
a
reason
then
for
the
odder
parts
of
her
behaviour
now
they
were
called
upon
to
endure
the
distressing
spectacle
of
a
hitherto
reserved
relative
letting
herself
go
to
unbridledness
ingeborg
was
going
to
make
a
scene
and
a
scene
was
a
thing
that
had
never
yet
anyhow
not
during
the
entire
bullivant
period
been
made
in
that
house
illustration
but
father
i
been
doing
it
too
bullivant
shut
her
eyes
tighter
and
tried
to
think
she
was
not
there
at
all
judith
turned
red
and
again
became
absorbed
in
the
teapot
the
bishop
after
the
first
cold
shock
natural
to
a
person
called
upon
to
contemplate
nakedness
where
up
to
then
there
had
been
clothes
put
down
his
cup
on
the
nearest
table
and
with
an
exaggerated
calm
stared
they
all
felt
intensely
uncomfortable
as
uncomfortable
as
though
she
had
begun
in
the
middle
of
the
to
remove
her
garments
one
by
one
and
cast
them
from
her
this
is
very
sad
ingeborg
said
the
bishop
is
it
oh
it
was
her
unexpected
answer
tears
in
her
eyes
she
was
so
tired
so
frightened
she
had
been
travelling
hard
since
the
morning
of
the
day
before
she
had
had
nothing
to
eat
for
a
time
that
seemed
infinite
and
yet
this
was
the
moment
just
because
she
had
betrayed
herself
to
her
mother
and
judith
in
which
she
was
going
to
have
to
tell
her
father
what
she
had
done
it
is
the
most
distressing
example
said
the
bishop
i
have
ever
seen
of
that
basest
of
sins
envy
envy
said
ingeborg
oh
no
that
not
what
it
is
oh
if
it
were
only
that
and
i
do
congratulate
judith
judith
i
do
i
do
my
dear
but
father
i
been
doing
it
too
it
was
out
now
and
she
looked
at
him
with
miserable
eyes
prepared
for
the
worst
doing
what
ingeborg
i
engaged
too
engaged
my
dear
ingeborg
the
bishop
was
alarmed
for
her
sanity
she
really
looked
very
strange
had
they
been
giving
her
too
much
gas
his
tone
became
careful
and
humouring
how
can
you
he
said
quietly
have
become
engaged
in
these
few
days
much
may
happen
in
a
week
said
ingeborg
it
jumped
out
she
did
try
not
to
say
it
she
was
unnerved
and
always
when
she
was
unnerved
she
said
the
first
thing
that
came
into
her
head
and
always
it
was
either
unfortunate
or
devastating
the
bishop
became
encased
in
ice
this
was
not
hysteria
it
was
something
immeasurably
worse
be
so
good
as
to
explain
he
said
sharply
and
waves
of
icy
air
seemed
to
issue
from
where
he
stood
and
heave
through
the
room
i
engaged
to
to
somebody
called
dremmel
said
ingeborg
i
do
not
know
the
name
do
you
marion
no
oh
no
breathed
bullivant
her
eyes
shut
robert
dremmel
said
ingeborg
who
are
the
dremmels
ingeborg
there
are
any
there
are
any
i
never
of
any
she
said
twisting
her
fingers
together
we
used
to
talk
about
about
things
like
dremmels
what
is
this
man
a
clergyman
oh
where
is
he
living
in
east
prussia
in
where
ingeborg
east
prussia
it
it
a
place
abroad
thank
you
i
am
aware
of
that
my
education
reaches
as
far
as
and
includes
east
prussia
bullivant
began
to
cry
not
loud
but
tears
that
stole
quietly
down
her
face
from
beneath
her
closed
eyelids
she
did
not
do
anything
to
them
but
lay
with
her
hands
clasped
on
her
breast
and
let
them
steal
what
was
the
use
of
being
a
christian
if
one
were
exposed
to
these
scenes
pray
why
is
he
in
east
prussia
asked
the
bishop
he
belongs
there
again
the
room
seemed
for
an
instant
to
hold
its
breath
am
i
to
understand
that
he
is
a
german
please
father
a
german
pastor
yes
father
not
by
any
chance
attached
in
some
ecclesiastical
capacity
to
the
kaiser
no
father
there
was
a
pause
your
aunt
what
did
she
say
to
this
she
did
say
anything
she
was
there
i
beg
your
pardon
i
have
been
at
my
aunt
judith
my
dear
will
you
kindly
leave
the
room
judith
got
up
and
went
while
she
was
crossing
to
the
door
and
until
she
had
shut
it
behind
her
there
was
silence
now
said
the
bishop
judith
being
safely
out
of
harm
way
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
explain
exactly
what
you
have
been
doing
i
think
i
wish
to
go
to
bed
murmured
bullivant
without
changing
her
attitude
or
opening
her
eyes
will
some
one
please
ring
for
richards
to
come
and
take
me
to
bed
but
neither
the
bishop
nor
ingeborg
heeded
her
i
did
to
do
anything
began
ingeborg
then
she
broke
off
and
said
i
can
explain
better
if
i
sit
down
and
dropped
into
the
chair
nearest
to
her
for
her
knees
felt
very
odd
she
saw
her
father
now
only
through
a
mist
she
was
going
to
have
to
oppose
him
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
and
her
nature
was
one
which
acquiesced
and
did
not
oppose
in
her
wretchedness
a
doubt
stole
across
her
mind
as
to
whether
herr
dremmel
was
worth
this
was
anything
in
fact
worth
fighting
about
and
with
one
father
and
against
whole
was
she
going
to
be
strong
enough
was
it
a
thing
one
ought
to
be
strong
about
would
not
true
strength
rather
lie
in
a
calm
continuation
of
life
at
home
what
when
one
came
to
think
of
it
was
east
prussia
really
to
her
and
those
and
all
that
water
she
wished
she
had
had
at
least
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
she
thought
perhaps
bread
and
butter
would
have
helped
her
not
to
doubt
she
looked
round
vaguely
so
as
not
to
have
to
meet
her
father
eye
for
a
moment
and
her
glance
fell
on
the
i
think
she
said
faintly
getting
up
again
i
have
some
tea
to
the
bishop
this
seemed
outrageous
he
watched
her
in
a
condition
of
icy
indignation
such
as
he
had
not
yet
in
his
life
experienced
his
daughter
his
daughter
for
whom
he
had
done
so
much
the
daughter
he
had
trained
for
years
sparing
no
pains
to
be
a
helpful
efficient
christian
woman
the
daughter
he
had
honoured
with
his
trust
letting
her
share
in
the
most
private
portions
of
his
daily
business
not
a
letter
had
he
received
that
she
had
not
seen
and
been
allowed
to
answer
not
a
step
in
any
direction
had
he
taken
without
permitting
her
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
seldom
he
supposed
bitterly
had
a
child
received
so
much
of
a
father
confidence
his
daughter
that
crumpled
and
disreputable
yes
now
he
knew
what
was
the
matter
with
her
appearance
figure
cynically
pouring
itself
out
tea
while
he
her
father
whom
she
had
been
deceiving
was
left
to
wait
for
her
explanations
until
such
time
as
she
should
have
sated
her
appetite
positively
she
had
succeeded
he
said
to
himself
bitterly
enraged
that
he
should
be
forced
to
be
bitterly
enraged
in
making
him
feel
less
like
a
bishop
should
feel
than
he
had
done
since
he
was
a
boy
it
because
i
had
nothing
to
eat
since
paris
ingeborg
explained
apologetically
holding
the
teapot
in
both
hands
because
one
by
itself
shook
too
much
and
feeling
too
that
the
moment
was
not
exactly
one
for
tea
the
bishop
started
since
where
he
said
paris
said
ingeborg
adding
tremulously
having
quite
lost
her
nerve
and
only
desiring
to
fill
up
the
silence
it
it
a
place
abroad
bullivant
murmured
a
more
definitely
earnest
request
that
richards
might
be
rung
for
to
take
her
to
bed
ingeborg
said
the
bishop
in
a
voice
she
did
not
know
paris
yes
father
last
night
ingeborg
come
here
he
was
pointing
to
a
chair
a
yard
or
two
from
the
hearthrug
on
which
he
stood
and
his
voice
was
very
strange
she
put
down
the
cup
with
a
shaking
hand
and
went
to
him
her
heart
was
in
her
mouth
what
have
you
been
doing
he
said
i
told
you
father
i
engaged
to
herr
how
did
you
get
to
paris
by
train
will
you
answer
me
what
were
you
doing
in
paris
having
dinner
she
was
terrified
her
father
was
talking
quite
loud
she
had
never
in
her
life
seen
him
like
this
she
answered
his
questions
quickly
her
heart
leaping
as
he
rapped
them
out
but
her
answers
seemed
to
make
him
still
angrier
if
only
he
would
let
her
explain
hear
her
out
but
he
hurled
questions
at
her
giving
her
no
time
at
all
father
she
said
hurriedly
seeing
that
after
that
last
answer
of
hers
he
did
for
a
moment
say
nothing
but
stood
looking
at
her
very
extraordinarily
please
let
me
tell
you
how
it
all
happened
it
take
a
minute
it
wo
really
and
then
you
see
you
i
did
mean
to
do
anything
i
really
did
but
the
dentist
pulled
my
tooth
out
so
quickly
that
very
first
day
and
so
instead
of
coming
home
i
went
to
lucerne
to
yes
she
nodded
in
a
frenzy
of
haste
to
get
it
all
said
to
lucerne
i
could
tell
you
why
but
i
did
i
seemed
pushed
there
and
after
a
little
while
i
got
engaged
and
i
did
in
the
least
mean
to
do
that
either
really
i
did
but
somehow
was
there
any
use
trying
to
tell
him
about
the
white
and
silver
cake
and
the
seven
witnesses
and
the
undoubting
kind
herr
dremmel
and
all
the
endless
small
links
in
the
chain
would
he
ever
ever
understand
somehow
i
you
see
she
added
helplessly
looking
up
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
an
appeal
for
comprehension
for
mercy
one
thing
leads
to
another
and
as
he
still
said
nothing
she
added
even
more
helplessly
herr
dremmel
sat
opposite
me
in
the
train
you
picked
him
up
casually
like
any
servant
girl
in
a
train
he
was
one
of
the
party
he
was
there
from
the
beginning
oh
yes
i
forgot
to
tell
you
it
was
one
of
dent
tours
you
went
on
a
dent
tour
yes
and
he
was
one
of
it
too
and
we
all
of
course
always
went
about
together
rather
like
a
school
two
and
two
i
suppose
because
of
the
pavement
she
said
now
saying
in
her
terror
anything
that
came
into
her
head
and
as
he
was
the
other
one
of
my
two
the
half
of
the
couple
i
was
the
other
one
of
you
know
father
we
we
got
engaged
do
you
take
me
for
a
fool
was
the
bishop
comment
ingeborg
heart
stood
still
how
could
her
father
even
oh
father
was
all
she
could
say
to
that
and
she
hung
her
head
in
the
entire
hopelessness
the
uselessness
of
trying
to
tell
him
anything
she
knew
she
had
been
saying
it
ridiculously
tumbling
out
a
confusion
of
what
must
sound
sad
nonsense
but
could
he
not
see
she
was
could
he
not
be
patient
and
help
her
to
make
her
clean
breast
i
stupid
she
said
looking
up
at
him
through
tears
and
suddenly
dropping
into
a
kind
of
nakedness
of
speech
a
speech
entirely
simple
and
entirely
true
stupid
with
fright
do
you
suggest
i
terrorize
you
inquired
the
incensed
bishop
yes
she
said
this
was
terrible
and
it
was
peculiarly
terrible
because
it
made
the
bishop
actually
wish
he
were
not
a
gentleman
then
indeed
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
deal
with
that
small
defying
creature
in
the
chair
when
it
comes
to
women
the
quickest
method
is
after
all
to
be
by
profession
a
navvy
he
shuddered
and
hastily
drew
his
thoughts
back
from
this
abyss
to
what
dread
depths
of
naturalness
was
she
not
by
her
conduct
dragging
him
father
said
ingeborg
who
had
now
got
down
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
very
worst
a
place
where
once
one
has
reached
it
an
awful
sincerity
takes
possession
of
one
tongue
do
you
see
this
look
at
them
and
she
held
up
her
hands
and
showed
him
while
she
herself
watched
them
as
though
they
were
somebody
else
how
they
were
shaking
is
that
being
afraid
look
at
them
it
fear
it
fear
of
you
it
you
making
them
do
that
and
think
of
it
i
a
woman
oh
i
i
but
whether
it
was
a
proper
shame
for
what
she
had
done
or
a
shocking
shame
for
her
compunctions
in
sinning
the
bishop
was
not
permitted
that
afternoon
to
discover
because
when
she
had
got
as
far
as
that
she
was
interrupted
by
being
obliged
to
faint
there
was
a
moment
confusion
while
she
tumbled
out
of
the
chair
and
lay
a
creased
strange
object
on
the
floor
owing
to
having
produced
an
exclamation
and
this
to
the
bishop
after
years
of
not
having
heard
her
more
than
murmur
was
almost
as
disconcerting
as
if
flinging
to
the
winds
she
had
suddenly
produced
fresh
offspring
he
quickly
however
recovered
the
necessary
presence
of
mind
and
the
bell
was
rung
for
richards
who
when
she
came
knelt
down
and
undid
ingeborg
blouse
and
something
on
a
long
chain
fell
out
jingling
it
was
her
father
cross
and
herr
dremmel
ring
metallically
hitting
each
other
the
bishop
left
the
room
without
a
word
chapter
ix
a
pall
descended
on
the
palace
and
enveloped
it
blackly
for
four
awful
days
during
which
bullivant
and
her
daughters
and
the
chaplain
and
the
secretary
and
all
the
servants
did
not
so
much
live
as
feel
their
way
about
with
a
careful
solicitude
for
inconspicuousness
this
pall
was
the
pall
of
the
bishop
wrath
and
there
was
so
much
of
it
that
it
actually
reached
over
into
the
dwellings
of
the
dean
and
chapter
and
blackened
those
white
spots
and
it
got
into
the
hitherto
calm
home
of
the
mayor
who
had
the
misfortune
to
have
business
with
the
bishop
the
very
day
after
ingeborg
return
and
an
edge
of
it
but
quite
enough
to
choke
an
old
man
even
invaded
the
cathedral
where
it
extinguished
the
head
verger
a
sunny
octogenarian
privileged
to
have
his
little
joke
with
the
bishop
and
who
had
it
unfortunately
as
usual
and
was
instantly
muffled
in
murkiness
and
never
joked
again
that
the
bishop
should
have
allowed
his
private
angers
to
overflow
beyond
his
garden
walls
he
who
had
never
been
anything
in
public
but
a
pattern
in
his
personal
beauty
his
lofty
calm
and
his
biblically
flavoured
eloquence
of
what
the
perfect
bishop
should
be
shows
the
extreme
disturbance
of
his
mind
but
it
was
not
that
he
allowed
it
it
was
that
he
could
not
help
it
he
had
thanks
to
his
daughter
lost
his
and
for
that
alone
without
anything
else
she
had
done
he
felt
he
could
never
forgive
her
gone
and
with
it
he
ached
he
positively
ached
during
those
first
four
black
days
in
which
his
natural
man
was
uppermost
a
creature
he
had
forgotten
so
long
was
it
since
he
had
heard
of
him
thoroughly
to
shake
his
daughter
and
the
terribleness
of
that
in
a
bishop
the
terribleness
of
being
aware
that
his
hands
were
twitching
to
shake
hands
which
he
acutely
knew
should
be
laid
on
no
one
except
in
blessing
consecrated
hands
divinely
appointed
to
bless
and
then
dismiss
in
peace
that
small
unimportant
thing
that
small
weak
thing
the
thing
he
had
generously
endowed
with
the
great
gift
of
life
and
along
with
that
gift
the
chance
it
would
never
have
had
except
for
him
of
eternal
blessedness
the
thing
he
had
fed
and
clothed
that
had
eaten
out
of
his
hand
and
been
all
bright
tameness
to
bring
disgrace
on
him
disgrace
outside
before
the
world
and
inside
before
his
abased
and
humiliated
self
and
she
had
brought
it
not
only
on
a
father
but
on
the
bishop
on
the
bench
the
best
known
also
and
most
frequently
mentioned
he
had
sometimes
surmised
with
a
kind
of
high
humility
in
the
how
could
one
put
it
with
sufficient
reverence
holy
gossip
of
the
angels
for
in
his
highest
moods
he
had
humbly
dared
to
believe
he
was
not
altogether
untalked
about
in
heaven
and
here
at
the
moment
of
much
thankfulness
and
legitimate
pride
when
his
other
daughter
was
so
beautifully
betrothed
came
this
one
and
with
impish
sacrilegiousness
dragged
him
her
father
into
the
dust
of
base
and
furious
instincts
the
awful
dust
in
which
those
sad
animal
men
sit
who
wish
to
and
do
beat
their
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
speak
to
her
he
would
not
allow
her
near
him
whatever
her
repentance
might
be
it
could
never
wipe
out
the
memory
of
these
hours
of
being
forced
by
her
to
recognise
what
after
all
the
years
of
careful
climbing
upwards
to
goodness
he
was
still
really
like
inside
terrible
to
be
stirred
not
only
to
unchristianity
but
to
vulgarity
terrible
to
be
made
to
wish
not
only
that
you
were
not
a
christian
but
not
a
gentleman
he
a
prince
of
the
church
was
desiring
to
be
a
navvy
for
a
space
during
which
he
could
be
unconditionally
active
he
a
prince
of
the
church
was
rent
and
distorted
by
feelings
that
would
have
disgraced
a
curate
he
could
never
forgive
her
but
the
darkest
hours
pass
and
just
as
the
concerned
diocese
was
beginning
to
fear
appendicitis
for
him
unable
in
any
other
way
to
account
for
the
way
he
remained
invisible
he
emerged
from
his
first
indignation
into
a
chillier
region
in
which
still
much
locked
in
his
chamber
he
sought
an
outlet
in
prayer
a
bishop
and
indeed
any
truly
good
and
public
man
is
restricted
in
his
outlets
he
can
with
propriety
have
only
two
prayer
and
his
wife
and
in
this
case
the
wife
was
unavailable
because
of
her
sofa
for
the
first
time
the
bishop
definitely
resented
the
sofa
he
told
himself
that
the
wife
of
a
prelate
however
ailing
and
he
believed
with
a
simplicity
on
such
points
that
she
did
ail
had
no
business
to
be
inaccessible
to
real
conversation
with
no
one
else
on
earth
except
his
wife
can
a
prelate
or
any
other
truly
good
and
public
man
have
real
conversation
without
losing
dignity
or
if
the
conversation
should
become
very
real
without
losing
office
that
is
why
most
prelates
are
married
the
best
men
wish
to
be
real
at
times
when
ingeborg
stripped
off
her
deferences
and
after
having
most
scandalously
run
away
and
most
scandalously
entangled
herself
with
an
alien
clerical
rogue
had
the
face
to
hold
up
her
hands
at
him
and
accuse
him
accuse
her
father
of
being
the
cause
of
their
shaking
the
bishop
had
been
as
much
horrified
as
if
his
own
garden
path
on
which
he
had
trodden
pleasantly
for
years
had
rent
itself
asunder
at
his
feet
and
gaped
at
him
he
had
made
the
path
he
had
paid
to
have
it
tidied
and
adorned
and
he
required
of
it
in
return
that
it
should
keep
quiet
and
be
useful
to
have
it
convulsed
into
an
earthquake
and
its
usefulness
interrupted
must
be
somebody
fault
and
his
instinct
very
properly
was
to
go
to
his
wife
and
tell
her
it
was
hers
but
there
was
the
sofa
he
desired
to
converse
with
his
wife
he
had
an
intolerable
desire
for
even
as
few
as
five
minutes
real
conversation
with
her
he
wanted
to
talk
about
the
manner
in
which
ingeborg
must
have
been
brought
up
about
the
amount
of
punishment
she
had
received
in
childhood
he
wished
to
be
informed
as
to
the
exact
nature
of
the
participation
her
mother
had
taken
in
her
moral
education
he
wished
to
discuss
the
responsibility
of
mothers
and
to
explain
his
views
on
the
consequences
of
maternal
neglect
and
he
wanted
too
to
draw
his
wife
attention
to
the
fact
she
easily
apparently
overlooked
that
he
had
bestowed
a
name
grown
celebrated
on
her
and
a
roof
that
through
his
gifts
and
god
mercy
was
not
an
ordinary
but
a
palace
roof
and
that
in
return
the
least
he
might
expect
in
short
he
wanted
to
talk
but
when
driven
by
his
urgencies
he
went
to
her
room
to
break
down
the
barricade
of
the
sofa
he
found
not
only
richards
hovering
there
tactfully
but
the
doctor
for
bullivant
had
foreseen
her
probable
desire
for
conversation
and
the
doctor
a
man
was
in
the
act
of
prescribing
complete
silence
it
was
then
that
thwarted
and
debarred
from
the
outlet
a
man
prefers
he
sought
his
other
outlet
and
laid
all
these
distressful
matters
in
prayer
at
the
feet
of
heaven
on
his
knees
in
his
chamber
he
earnestly
begged
forgiveness
for
his
descent
to
naturalness
and
a
restoration
of
his
without
his
what
would
become
of
him
he
had
lived
with
it
so
intimately
and
long
fervently
he
desired
the
molten
moments
in
which
his
hands
had
twitched
wiped
out
and
forgotten
he
asked
for
help
to
conduct
himself
henceforth
with
calm
he
implored
to
be
given
patience
he
implored
to
be
given
and
presently
after
two
days
of
his
spare
moments
spent
in
this
manner
he
was
sitting
upon
a
chair
and
telling
himself
that
the
main
objection
to
praying
if
one
might
say
so
with
all
due
reverence
is
that
it
is
it
is
a
monologue
said
the
bishop
also
with
all
due
reverence
and
in
troubles
of
the
kind
he
was
in
one
needs
to
be
sure
one
is
being
attended
to
he
did
not
think
he
could
possibly
be
being
attended
to
because
pray
as
he
might
withdraw
and
wrestle
as
he
might
he
continued
to
want
to
shake
his
daughter
for
there
was
the
constant
irritation
going
on
of
the
affairs
of
the
diocese
getting
into
a
more
hopeless
disorder
all
that
time
she
was
away
guiltily
gadding
and
now
all
this
time
she
was
not
away
but
unavailable
till
she
should
have
utterly
repented
his
letters
were
piling
themselves
up
into
confused
heaps
and
his
engagements
were
a
wilderness
in
which
he
wandered
alone
in
the
dark
the
chaplain
and
the
typist
did
what
they
could
but
they
had
not
been
with
him
so
long
as
his
daughter
and
were
not
possessed
of
the
mechanical
brainlessness
that
makes
a
woman
so
satisfactory
as
a
secretary
his
daughter
not
having
what
might
be
called
actual
brains
was
not
troubled
by
thought
the
distresses
of
possible
alternatives
did
not
disturb
her
she
did
not
therefore
disturb
him
by
suggesting
them
she
was
mechanically
meticulous
she
respected
detail
she
remembered
she
knew
not
only
what
had
to
be
done
which
was
easy
but
what
had
to
be
done
exactly
first
and
both
the
chaplain
and
the
typist
were
men
with
ideas
and
instead
of
assisting
him
along
one
straight
and
narrow
path
which
is
the
only
way
of
really
getting
anywhere
including
remembered
the
bishop
to
heaven
they
were
constantly
looking
to
the
right
and
the
left
doubting
weighing
hesitating
the
chaplain
had
as
many
eyes
for
a
question
as
a
fly
and
saw
it
from
as
many
angles
fairness
desirability
the
probable
views
of
the
other
side
their
equal
tightness
these
things
faltered
interminably
round
each
letter
to
be
answered
were
hesitated
over
interminably
in
the
mellow
intonations
of
that
young
man
voice
and
he
was
echoed
and
supported
by
the
typist
who
was
also
from
oxford
and
had
been
given
this
chance
of
nearness
to
the
most
distinguished
of
bishops
at
such
a
youthful
age
that
the
undergraduate
milk
had
not
yet
dried
on
the
corners
of
his
eloquent
and
hesitating
mouth
and
gave
a
peculiarly
sickly
flavour
thought
the
irritated
bishop
to
whatever
came
out
of
it
the
bishop
felt
that
if
this
went
on
much
longer
the
work
of
the
diocese
would
come
to
a
standstill
in
ten
days
the
easter
recess
would
be
over
and
he
was
due
in
the
house
of
lords
where
he
had
been
put
down
for
a
speech
on
the
home
rule
bill
from
the
point
of
view
of
simple
faith
and
how
was
he
to
leave
things
in
this
muddle
at
home
and
how
was
he
to
have
the
peace
of
mind
the
empty
clarity
appropriate
to
a
proper
approach
of
the
measure
if
his
inward
eye
went
roving
away
to
redchester
all
the
time
and
to
the
increasing
confusion
on
his
study
table
the
trail
of
ingeborg
was
over
all
his
day
when
warm
and
ruffled
from
prayer
he
plunged
down
into
his
work
again
he
could
not
do
a
thing
without
being
reminded
she
was
not
there
he
was
forced
to
think
of
her
every
moment
of
his
time
it
was
ignoble
but
without
her
he
was
like
an
actor
who
has
learned
not
his
part
but
to
lean
on
the
prompter
and
who
finds
himself
on
the
stage
with
the
prompter
gone
dead
in
his
box
she
was
dead
to
him
dead
in
obstinate
sin
and
dignity
demanded
she
should
continue
dead
until
she
came
of
her
own
accord
and
told
him
she
had
done
with
that
terrible
affair
of
the
east
prussian
pastor
he
did
not
know
whether
he
would
then
forgive
her
he
would
probably
defer
forgiveness
as
a
disciplinary
measure
after
having
implored
heaven
guidance
but
he
would
allow
a
certain
amount
of
resurrection
sufficient
to
enable
her
to
sit
up
at
her
desk
every
day
and
disentangle
the
confusion
her
wickedness
alone
had
caused
in
the
evenings
she
would
he
thought
at
any
rate
for
a
time
be
best
put
back
in
her
grave
at
this
point
he
began
to
be
able
to
say
poor
girl
and
to
feel
that
he
pitied
her
but
it
was
not
till
the
end
of
the
week
as
sunday
drew
near
that
his
prayers
did
after
all
begin
to
be
answered
and
he
regained
enough
control
of
his
words
if
not
of
his
thoughts
to
be
able
to
reappear
among
his
family
and
show
nothing
less
becoming
than
reserve
he
even
succeeded
though
without
speaking
to
her
in
kissing
forehead
night
and
morning
and
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
her
when
she
went
to
bed
as
he
had
done
from
her
earliest
years
she
seemed
smaller
than
ever
hardly
there
at
all
and
made
him
think
of
an
empty
dress
walking
about
with
a
head
on
it
contemplating
her
when
she
was
not
looking
his
desire
to
shake
her
became
finally
quenched
by
the
perception
that
really
there
would
be
nothing
to
shake
it
would
be
like
shaking
out
mere
clothes
garments
with
the
body
gone
out
of
them
there
would
be
dust
but
little
satisfaction
she
had
evidently
been
feeling
he
was
slightly
soothed
to
observe
for
not
only
was
her
dress
empty
but
her
face
seemed
diminished
and
she
certainly
was
remarkably
pale
she
struck
him
as
very
unattractive
entirely
designed
by
providence
for
a
happy
home
life
and
to
think
that
this
nothing
this
amazing
littleness
well
well
poor
girl
on
the
sunday
afternoon
he
determined
to
help
her
by
getting
into
touch
with
her
from
the
pulpit
on
that
day
he
several
times
assured
himself
before
preaching
that
his
only
feeling
in
the
sad
affair
was
one
of
concern
for
her
and
grief
the
pulpit
he
knew
from
experience
was
a
calm
and
place
when
he
was
in
it
it
was
indeed
his
way
with
a
pulpit
that
had
brought
the
bishop
to
the
pinnacle
of
the
church
on
which
he
found
himself
he
was
at
his
best
in
it
knowing
it
for
a
blessed
spot
free
from
controversy
pure
from
contradiction
a
place
where
personal
emotions
could
find
no
footing
owing
to
the
wise
custom
that
prevented
congregations
from
answering
back
put
into
common
terms
the
terms
of
his
undergraduate
days
he
could
let
himself
rip
in
the
pulpit
and
the
bishop
was
in
a
ripped
condition
altogether
at
his
greatest
he
spoke
that
sunday
specially
to
ingeborg
and
he
told
himself
that
what
had
come
straight
from
his
heart
must
needs
go
straight
to
hers
the
bible
was
very
plain
it
did
not
mince
matters
as
to
the
dangers
she
was
running
the
punishment
for
her
class
of
sin
right
through
it
was
various
and
severe
not
that
the
ravens
of
another
age
and
the
eagles
of
a
different
climate
he
had
taken
as
his
text
that
passage
or
rather
portion
of
a
passage
he
described
it
as
remarkable
in
the
proverbs
the
ravens
of
the
valley
shall
pick
it
out
and
the
young
eagles
shall
eat
it
were
likely
ever
miraculously
to
appear
in
redchester
though
even
on
that
point
the
bishop
held
that
nothing
was
certain
but
there
were
he
explained
spiritual
ravens
and
eagles
provided
by
an
providence
for
requirements
whose
work
was
even
more
thorough
and
destructive
he
earnestly
implored
those
members
of
his
flock
who
knew
themselves
guilty
of
the
particular
sin
the
passage
referred
to
to
seek
forgiveness
of
their
parents
before
heaven
interfered
he
pointed
out
that
what
is
most
needed
if
people
are
to
live
with
any
zest
and
fine
result
at
all
is
encouragement
and
what
encouragement
could
equal
full
and
free
forgiveness
the
bible
he
said
understood
this
very
well
and
the
prodigal
son
father
never
hesitated
in
his
encouragement
it
seemed
difficult
to
suppose
one
could
equal
the
lavishness
of
the
best
robe
the
ring
the
shoes
and
the
fatted
calf
yet
he
felt
certain
he
there
were
fathers
at
that
very
moment
there
in
that
town
nay
in
that
cathedral
ready
with
all
and
more
than
that
who
would
wish
to
punish
his
dear
child
the
soul
given
into
his
hands
to
be
whitened
for
heaven
one
knew
from
one
own
experience
all
who
had
once
been
children
must
know
how
sorry
one
was
for
having
done
wrong
how
one
felt
about
it
and
just
then
just
at
that
moment
of
sorrow
of
heart
blood
was
not
what
one
needed
so
that
one
might
get
on
one
feet
again
quickly
and
do
better
than
ever
not
punishment
but
forgiveness
a
frequent
and
free
forgiveness
said
the
bishop
and
his
voice
was
beautiful
as
he
said
it
was
one
of
the
chief
necessities
of
life
what
poor
children
want
poor
frail
children
so
infinitely
apt
to
fall
so
infinitely
clumsy
at
getting
up
is
a
continual
wiping
out
and
never
thinking
again
of
the
yesterdays
a
daily
presentation
by
authority
to
yesterday
stumblers
of
that
most
bracing
object
the
cleaned
and
empty
slate
why
it
was
as
necessary
he
declared
his
fine
face
aglow
if
one
was
to
work
well
and
add
cheerful
contribution
to
the
world
happiness
as
a
nourishing
and
sufficient
breakfast
the
congregation
thrilled
at
this
homely
touch
and
to
numb
a
human
being
powers
of
cheerful
contribution
by
punishment
was
how
cruel
then
to
force
a
father
by
stubbornness
to
punish
how
cruel
and
how
sinful
to
hinder
him
by
not
seeking
out
at
once
what
he
so
freely
offered
to
hinder
him
from
bringing
forth
his
best
robe
his
ring
his
fatted
calf
what
a
heavy
responsibility
towards
their
fathers
did
children
bear
said
the
bishop
who
had
ceased
himself
being
anybody
child
many
years
before
this
he
said
is
a
sermon
to
children
to
erring
children
to
those
sad
children
who
have
gone
astray
we
are
all
children
here
he
explained
and
if
life
has
been
with
us
so
long
that
we
can
no
longer
find
any
one
we
may
still
with
any
certainty
call
father
we
are
yet
to
the
end
children
of
the
kingdom
but
he
continued
though
every
single
soul
in
this
cathedral
is
necessarily
some
one
child
not
every
single
soul
in
it
is
inevitably
some
one
father
and
he
would
say
a
few
words
to
the
fathers
and
remind
them
of
the
infinite
effect
of
love
to
punish
your
child
is
to
make
its
repentance
go
sour
within
it
do
not
punish
it
love
it
love
it
continuously
generously
if
needs
be
obstinately
smite
its
hardness
as
once
a
rock
was
smitten
with
the
rod
of
generosity
give
it
a
chance
of
gushing
forth
into
living
repentance
generosity
begets
generosity
love
begets
love
show
your
love
show
your
generosity
forgive
freely
magnificently
oh
my
brothers
oh
my
children
my
little
sorry
children
what
could
not
one
what
would
not
one
do
in
return
for
love
the
bishop
face
was
lifted
up
as
he
finished
to
the
light
of
the
west
window
his
voice
was
charged
with
feeling
he
had
forgotten
the
ravens
and
eagles
of
the
beginning
for
he
never
allowed
his
beginnings
to
disturb
his
endings
well
knowing
his
congregation
forgot
them
too
he
was
an
artist
at
reaching
into
the
hearts
of
the
uneducated
everything
helped
him
his
beauty
his
voice
and
the
manifest
way
in
which
his
own
words
moved
him
and
the
typist
as
he
walked
back
to
the
palace
with
the
chaplain
across
the
daisies
of
the
close
was
unable
to
agree
with
the
chaplain
that
a
course
at
oxford
even
now
in
close
reasoning
might
help
the
bishop
the
typist
thought
it
would
spoil
him
and
offered
to
lay
the
chaplain
twenty
to
one
that
redchester
that
afternoon
would
be
full
of
erring
children
upsetting
their
fathers
sunday
by
wanting
to
be
forgiven
it
was
and
ingeborg
was
one
of
them
chapter
x
she
waylaid
him
after
tea
on
the
stairs
father
she
said
timidly
as
he
was
passing
on
in
silence
well
ingeborg
said
the
bishop
pausing
and
gravely
attentive
i
want
to
tell
you
how
sorry
i
am
yes
ingeborg
so
sorry
so
ashamed
that
i
i
went
away
like
that
on
that
tour
it
was
very
wrong
of
me
and
i
went
with
your
money
oh
it
was
ugly
i
hope
you
forgive
me
father
freely
ingeborg
it
would
be
sad
indeed
if
i
lagged
behind
our
great
exemplar
in
the
matter
of
forgiveness
then
i
may
come
back
to
work
when
you
tell
me
you
have
broken
off
your
clandestine
engagement
but
father
there
are
no
buts
ingeborg
but
you
said
in
your
sermon
the
bishop
passed
on
in
her
eagerness
ingeborg
put
her
hand
detainingly
on
his
sleeve
a
familiarity
hitherto
unheard
of
in
that
ordered
and
temperate
household
but
your
sermon
you
said
in
your
sermon
father
why
how
can
free
forgiveness
have
conditions
they
did
do
it
that
way
in
the
bible
this
to
him
who
was
by
the
very
nature
of
his
high
office
a
specialist
in
forgiveness
poor
girl
poor
girl
you
said
yourself
about
the
prodigal
son
his
father
forgave
and
perhaps
he
done
worse
things
even
than
going
to
lucerne
we
are
not
told
ingeborg
of
any
clandestine
engagement
said
the
bishop
pursuing
his
way
hampered
but
as
he
was
glad
to
remember
afterwards
calm
but
you
know
about
it
how
can
it
be
clandestine
when
you
know
about
it
once
more
ingeborg
there
are
no
buts
but
why
should
i
marry
a
good
man
she
was
actually
following
him
up
quite
a
number
of
the
stairs
still
with
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
her
face
so
unattractive
in
its
unwomanly
eagerness
quite
close
to
his
why
should
i
have
to
be
forgiven
for
wanting
to
marry
a
good
man
everybody
marries
good
men
mother
did
and
you
never
told
her
she
was
to
oh
oh
she
went
on
as
his
door
was
quietly
closed
upon
her
that
is
free
forgiveness
at
all
it
is
what
you
it
is
what
you
it
and
her
voice
from
the
doormat
became
quite
a
cry
regardless
of
possible
listening
wilsons
how
glad
he
was
that
he
had
been
able
to
put
her
aside
quietly
and
get
himself
still
controlled
into
his
how
strange
and
new
were
these
reckless
outbreaks
of
unreserve
and
her
reasoning
how
wholly
deplorable
she
wished
unhappy
girl
to
enjoy
the
advantages
and
privileges
of
the
forgiven
state
while
continuing
in
the
sin
that
had
procured
the
forgiveness
she
wished
he
reflected
though
in
educated
language
to
eat
her
cake
and
have
it
too
yet
was
it
not
clear
that
a
free
forgiveness
could
only
be
bestowed
on
an
unlimited
penitence
there
could
be
no
reservations
of
particular
branches
of
sin
all
must
be
lopped
and
the
east
prussian
pastor
was
a
branch
that
must
be
lopped
with
the
cleanest
final
cut
before
real
submission
could
be
said
to
have
set
in
but
the
bishop
in
his
though
he
retained
his
apparent
calm
was
sore
within
him
his
sermon
had
failed
the
girl
must
be
a
stone
it
was
he
thought
profoundly
worried
as
if
he
had
given
her
nearly
a
week
for
undisturbed
thought
and
had
approached
her
that
day
with
all
the
helpfulness
in
his
power
from
the
pulpit
both
these
things
he
had
done
and
she
was
no
nearer
recovery
than
before
was
training
then
nothing
was
environment
nothing
was
blood
nothing
was
the
blood
of
bishops
that
blood
which
of
all
bloods
must
surely
be
most
potent
in
preventing
its
inheritors
in
all
their
doings
nothing
on
the
following
afternoon
there
was
a
party
at
the
palace
arranged
by
bullivant
in
the
confident
days
before
she
knew
what
ingeborg
was
really
like
it
was
a
congratulatory
party
for
judith
and
all
redchester
and
all
the
county
had
been
invited
nothing
could
stop
this
party
but
a
death
in
the
household
any
death
even
richards
might
do
but
nothing
short
of
death
thought
the
afflicted
lady
wondering
how
she
was
to
get
through
the
afternoon
and
as
she
crept
on
to
her
sofa
at
a
quarter
to
four
to
be
put
by
richards
into
the
final
folds
and
knew
that
as
four
struck
a
great
surge
of
friends
would
pour
in
over
her
and
that
for
three
hours
she
would
have
to
be
bright
and
happy
about
judith
and
sympathetically
explanatory
about
ingeborg
who
looked
altogether
too
odd
to
be
explained
only
by
a
long
past
dentist
she
felt
so
very
low
that
she
was
unable
to
stop
herself
from
thinking
it
was
a
pity
people
did
die
a
little
oftener
especially
maids
especially
maids
who
were
being
so
clumsy
with
the
cushions
and
the
master
of
ananias
had
been
there
since
before
luncheon
and
how
exhausting
that
was
she
had
had
to
do
most
of
the
entertaining
of
him
the
bishop
being
unavoidably
absent
from
the
meal
and
ingeborg
who
did
the
conversation
in
that
family
not
being
able
to
now
because
she
was
in
disgrace
and
judith
dear
child
never
saying
much
at
any
time
and
the
master
had
been
very
exuberant
and
his
vitality
delightful
of
course
but
just
a
little
overwhelming
at
his
age
had
reminded
her
that
she
needed
care
how
difficult
it
had
been
to
get
him
out
into
the
garden
to
somewhere
where
she
was
she
had
got
him
there
till
two
by
which
time
he
had
been
vital
without
stopping
since
twelve
and
even
then
she
had
had
to
invent
a
in
full
blossom
that
she
was
at
all
sure
about
and
tell
him
she
had
heard
it
was
a
wonderful
sight
and
ought
not
to
be
missed
but
how
difficult
it
had
been
judith
had
not
seemed
to
want
to
show
him
the
and
he
would
not
go
and
look
at
it
unless
she
went
too
judith
had
gone
at
last
but
with
an
expression
on
her
face
as
though
she
thought
she
was
going
to
have
to
bear
things
and
no
girl
should
show
a
thought
like
that
before
marriage
and
then
there
had
been
an
immense
number
of
small
matters
to
see
to
because
of
the
party
matters
ingeborg
had
always
seen
to
but
could
now
because
she
was
in
disgrace
and
how
difficult
all
that
was
still
bullivant
felt
deeply
if
vaguely
that
nobody
temporarily
evil
should
be
allowed
to
minister
to
anybody
permanently
good
such
persons
she
felt
should
be
put
aside
into
a
place
made
roomy
for
repentance
by
the
clearing
out
of
all
claims
during
the
whole
of
the
week
since
her
daughter
return
she
had
not
let
her
even
pour
out
tea
either
when
the
riven
family
was
by
itself
or
when
congratulatory
callers
came
poor
ingeborg
is
very
well
she
had
murmured
quenching
the
inquisitiveness
natural
to
callers
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
first
evening
when
the
full
horror
of
what
her
daughter
had
done
became
clear
to
her
that
she
would
ask
nothing
of
her
not
even
tea
but
it
did
make
difficulties
she
felt
entirely
low
quite
damp
with
the
exertion
of
meeting
them
when
she
crept
into
position
on
the
sofa
at
a
quarter
to
four
and
waited
with
closed
eyes
for
the
next
wave
of
life
that
would
wash
over
her
and
it
all
happened
as
she
had
feared
she
was
perpetually
having
to
explain
ingeborg
guest
after
guest
came
up
with
the
expressions
of
rejoicing
proper
to
guests
invited
to
rejoice
over
judith
and
the
smiling
laudations
of
what
was
indeed
a
vision
of
beauty
each
ended
with
a
question
about
ingeborg
what
had
she
been
doing
the
awful
innocence
of
the
question
how
perfectly
miserably
seedy
she
looked
poor
little
ingeborg
was
it
really
just
that
tiresome
tooth
bullivant
as
she
murmured
what
she
could
in
reply
to
this
ceaseless
flow
of
sympathy
from
the
retired
officers
and
their
wives
and
daughters
and
the
cathedral
dignitaries
and
their
wives
and
daughters
and
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
county
who
came
without
their
men
because
their
men
would
come
felt
vaguely
but
deeply
that
it
was
somehow
wrong
that
ingeborg
should
both
sin
and
be
sympathised
with
she
had
no
right
her
injured
mother
felt
to
look
so
small
and
stricken
her
family
had
quite
properly
removed
her
outside
the
pale
of
their
affection
till
she
should
announce
her
engagement
to
that
dreadful
german
and
ask
to
be
forgiven
for
ever
having
been
engaged
at
all
but
she
ought
not
to
look
like
somebody
who
is
outside
a
pale
she
seemed
positively
to
be
advertising
the
pale
it
was
bad
taste
it
was
really
the
worst
of
taste
when
you
were
the
sinner
to
look
like
the
sinned
against
to
look
to
droop
openly
yet
never
could
a
girl
who
had
done
such
horrible
such
detestably
deceitful
and
vulgar
things
have
been
treated
so
gently
by
her
family
it
had
been
bullivant
felt
the
only
good
thing
in
a
wretched
affair
the
perfect
breeding
with
which
the
bullivants
had
met
the
situation
not
one
of
them
had
even
remotely
alluded
to
the
scene
she
had
made
the
first
afternoon
no
one
had
questioned
her
no
one
had
troubled
her
in
any
way
she
had
been
left
quite
free
and
no
one
had
exacted
the
smallest
sacrifice
of
her
time
to
any
of
their
needs
her
father
had
given
her
a
complete
holiday
not
allowing
her
at
all
in
his
study
and
whenever
she
had
attempted
to
do
anything
for
her
mother
or
in
the
house
richards
had
been
rung
for
judith
dear
child
seemed
instinctively
to
do
the
right
thing
and
without
a
word
from
her
mother
avoided
ingeborg
she
was
so
delicate
about
it
so
fine
in
her
feeling
that
here
was
something
not
quite
nice
that
she
turned
red
each
time
ingeborg
during
the
first
day
or
two
tried
to
talk
to
her
and
quietly
went
into
another
room
all
the
last
part
of
the
week
ingeborg
had
spent
in
the
garden
quite
free
quite
undisturbed
not
a
claim
on
her
and
yet
here
she
was
standing
about
at
the
party
or
sitting
alone
in
foolish
corners
thin
and
pale
and
unsmiling
like
a
reproach
through
a
gap
in
the
crowd
bullivant
presently
saw
her
being
talked
to
by
one
who
had
once
been
a
general
but
now
in
retirement
wreaked
his
disciplines
on
bees
she
just
had
time
to
notice
how
her
daughter
started
and
flushed
when
this
man
suddenly
addressed
her
such
bad
manners
to
start
and
flush
before
the
crowd
closed
again
she
shut
her
eyes
for
a
moment
and
felt
very
helpless
who
knew
to
what
lengths
ingeborg
bad
manners
might
not
go
and
what
she
might
not
be
saying
to
the
man
what
the
general
was
telling
her
with
the
hearty
kindliness
fathers
of
other
daughters
use
to
daughters
of
other
fathers
will
use
indeed
commented
the
bishop
observing
the
incident
from
afar
and
allowing
himself
the
solace
of
an
instant
bitterness
to
any
created
female
thing
if
only
she
will
oblige
them
by
not
being
their
own
was
that
he
could
have
her
looking
like
this
oh
like
what
asked
ingeborg
quickly
starting
and
flushing
for
her
week
as
an
outcast
had
lowered
her
vitality
to
such
an
extent
that
she
was
morbidly
afraid
her
face
might
somehow
have
become
a
sort
of
awful
crystal
in
which
everybody
would
be
able
to
see
the
rigi
and
herself
being
proposed
to
on
its
top
shocking
white
about
the
gills
said
the
hearty
man
standing
over
her
cup
in
hand
and
on
his
toes
and
heels
because
his
boots
creaked
and
it
gave
him
a
vague
pleasure
to
make
them
go
on
doing
it
you
must
come
round
and
have
a
good
game
of
tennis
with
dorothy
some
afternoon
you
been
shut
up
working
too
hard
at
that
business
that
what
you
been
doing
young
lady
i
wish
i
had
oh
i
wish
i
had
said
ingeborg
pressing
her
hands
together
and
looking
up
at
this
stray
bit
of
kindliness
with
a
quick
gratefulness
we
always
think
of
you
as
sitting
there
writing
writing
the
hearty
man
went
on
more
intent
on
what
he
was
saying
than
on
what
she
was
saying
father
right
hand
mother
indispensable
you
know
i
tell
dorothy
ingeborg
twisted
on
her
chair
oh
she
said
do
tell
dorothy
do
tell
her
tell
her
what
you
do
know
what
i
was
going
to
say
yes
i
do
about
that
how
daughters
ought
to
be
like
and
dorothy
so
good
and
dear
and
would
ever
in
this
world
have
gone
off
to
she
stopped
but
only
just
in
time
and
looked
at
him
frightened
she
had
all
but
said
it
the
general
however
was
staring
at
her
with
kindly
incomprehension
her
head
drooped
a
little
and
she
gazed
vaguely
at
his
toes
as
they
rhythmically
touched
and
were
lifted
up
from
the
carpet
nobody
knows
what
anybody
else
is
really
like
inside
she
finished
forlornly
you
come
up
and
have
some
tennis
he
said
patting
her
on
the
shoulder
and
later
on
to
the
bishop
he
remarked
in
his
hearty
desire
to
have
everything
trim
and
in
its
proper
place
the
young
in
the
fresh
air
older
persons
at
desks
in
studies
white
faces
reserved
for
invalids
roses
blooming
in
the
cheeks
of
girls
that
he
overwork
that
little
daughter
of
his
overwork
exclaimed
the
bishop
full
of
bitter
memories
of
an
empty
week
turn
her
out
into
the
sun
bully
my
boy
said
the
general
whose
fag
the
bishop
had
been
at
eton
into
the
sun
exclaimed
the
bishop
having
for
six
mortal
days
observed
her
from
windows
horribly
idling
in
it
if
you
keep
shut
up
you
ca
expect
girls
any
more
than
you
can
expect
a
decent
bee
to
provide
you
with
honey
honey
exclaimed
the
bishop
that
duchess
who
had
wanted
her
eldest
son
to
marry
judith
tapped
ingeborg
on
the
arm
with
her
umbrella
as
she
passed
her
followed
by
her
daughter
and
said
little
pale
child
little
pale
child
and
shook
her
head
at
her
and
frowned
and
smiled
and
whispered
to
pamela
that
it
looked
very
like
jealousy
and
pamela
said
nonsense
to
that
and
tried
to
linger
and
talk
to
ingeborg
but
her
mother
filled
with
the
passion
for
refreshment
that
seizes
all
persons
who
go
to
parties
dragged
her
along
with
her
to
where
it
could
be
found
and
on
the
way
she
was
seen
by
the
bishop
who
at
once
left
the
old
lady
who
was
talking
to
him
to
enfold
lady
pamela
in
his
care
and
compass
her
about
with
a
cloud
of
little
attentions
chairs
ices
fruit
for
not
only
had
he
confirmed
her
but
he
felt
a
peculiar
interest
in
her
particular
kind
of
intelligent
beauty
of
all
the
confirmation
crosses
he
had
given
away
he
liked
best
to
think
of
lady
pamela
certainly
in
that
soft
cradle
beneath
the
muslin
and
lace
of
propriety
he
could
be
sure
it
would
not
jangle
against
an
illicit
and
alien
ring
you
still
wear
it
he
said
his
beautiful
voice
lowered
to
suit
the
subject
charged
with
feeling
as
with
his
own
hands
he
brought
her
tea
and
he
felt
a
little
checked
a
little
disappointed
when
she
said
smiling
at
him
her
grey
eyes
level
with
his
so
well
grown
was
she
wear
what
and
another
thing
this
young
woman
did
that
afternoon
that
checked
and
disappointed
him
she
showed
a
disposition
to
take
care
of
him
and
no
bishop
of
sixty
or
indeed
any
other
honest
man
of
sixty
likes
that
she
thinks
me
he
thought
with
acute
and
pained
surprise
as
she
charmingly
made
him
sit
down
lest
he
might
be
tired
standing
and
charmingly
shut
a
window
behind
them
lest
he
should
be
in
a
draught
and
charmingly
later
on
when
he
took
her
down
the
garden
to
show
her
the
turned
her
pretty
head
and
asked
him
over
her
shoulder
whether
she
were
walking
too
fast
she
thinks
me
he
thought
and
it
was
an
amazement
to
him
for
only
last
year
he
was
still
still
in
the
fifties
and
the
fifties
once
one
was
used
to
them
were
nothing
at
all
he
became
very
grave
with
lady
pamela
he
felt
that
the
showing
of
the
had
lost
a
good
deal
of
its
savour
he
felt
it
still
more
when
turning
the
bend
in
the
path
that
led
to
the
secluded
corner
that
made
the
popular
as
a
resort
he
perceived
ingeborg
sitting
beneath
it
she
was
alone
why
is
she
always
by
herself
asked
lady
pamela
who
was
the
bishop
could
not
help
thinking
being
rather
steadily
tactless
he
made
no
answer
he
was
too
seriously
nettled
apart
from
everything
else
to
have
one
daughter
cropping
up
ingeborg
called
lady
pamela
waving
her
sunshade
to
attract
her
attention
as
they
walked
on
towards
her
for
ingeborg
under
the
tree
was
sitting
with
her
chin
on
her
hand
looking
at
nothing
and
once
more
advertising
by
her
attitude
bullivant
would
have
considered
that
she
was
outside
the
pale
i
think
said
the
bishop
pausing
we
ought
perhaps
to
go
back
ought
we
oh
why
it
lovely
here
ingeborg
i
think
said
the
bishop
now
altogether
annoyed
at
this
persistent
determination
to
include
his
daughter
as
though
one
could
ever
satisfactorily
include
daughters
in
what
might
have
been
a
poetic
conversation
between
beauty
and
youth
on
the
one
side
and
prestige
and
more
than
common
gifts
on
the
other
beauty
too
if
you
come
to
that
and
as
great
in
its
male
ripe
way
as
hers
in
its
girlishness
i
think
that
i
at
any
rate
must
go
back
my
wife
ingeborg
wake
up
what
are
you
dreaming
about
positively
lady
pamela
was
not
listening
to
him
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
her
to
go
on
waving
her
sunshade
at
his
daughter
if
that
was
what
she
liked
and
went
back
towards
the
house
reflecting
that
women
really
are
quite
sadly
deficient
in
imagination
and
that
it
is
a
great
pity
even
this
one
this
bright
being
was
so
unimaginative
that
she
actually
saw
no
reason
why
a
man
daughter
really
a
deficiency
of
imagination
amounted
to
stupidity
he
hardly
liked
to
have
to
admit
that
lady
pamela
was
stupid
but
anyhow
women
ought
not
to
have
the
vote
he
went
away
back
into
the
main
garden
along
the
path
by
the
great
herbaceous
border
then
in
a
special
splendour
of
tulips
and
all
the
clean
magnificence
of
may
thinking
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
how
different
things
would
have
been
if
when
he
was
a
curate
he
had
been
sane
enough
not
to
marry
the
clearness
now
in
his
life
if
only
he
had
not
done
that
nobody
in
it
no
thwarting
daughters
and
himself
vigorous
distinguished
entirely
desirable
as
a
husband
choosing
with
the
mellow
yet
not
too
mellow
wisdom
of
middle
life
exactly
who
was
best
fitted
to
share
the
advantages
he
had
to
offer
even
lady
pamela
would
not
then
have
been
able
to
think
of
him
as
old
it
was
his
family
that
dated
him
his
wife
his
daughters
the
folly
of
curates
the
black
incurable
folly
of
curates
and
he
forgot
for
a
gloomy
instant
what
he
as
a
rule
with
a
sigh
acknowledged
that
it
had
all
been
providence
even
then
restlessly
at
work
guiding
him
and
that
bullivant
and
the
girls
merely
constituted
one
of
its
many
inscrutable
ends
the
baser
portion
of
the
bishop
brain
was
about
to
substitute
another
word
for
guiding
when
he
was
saved
providentially
the
nobler
portion
of
his
brain
instantly
pointed
out
by
encountering
the
duchess
she
was
coming
slowly
along
examining
the
plants
in
the
border
with
the
interest
of
a
and
pointing
out
by
means
of
her
umbrella
the
various
successes
to
a
man
the
bishop
took
to
be
one
of
her
party
he
was
a
big
man
in
shiny
black
with
something
of
the
air
of
one
of
the
less
reputable
cabinet
ministers
and
was
in
fact
herr
dremmel
but
no
one
except
herr
dremmel
knew
it
he
had
arrived
that
afternoon
a
man
animated
by
a
single
purpose
which
was
to
marry
ingeborg
as
soon
as
possible
and
get
back
quickly
to
his
work
and
he
had
come
straight
from
the
station
to
the
palace
and
walked
in
unquestioned
with
all
the
others
and
after
a
period
of
peering
about
in
the
for
ingeborg
had
drifted
out
into
the
garden
where
he
had
at
once
stumbled
upon
the
duchess
who
was
being
embittered
by
a
prebendary
of
servile
habits
who
insisted
on
agreeing
with
her
as
to
the
latin
name
of
a
patch
of
when
she
knew
all
the
time
she
was
wrong
you
tell
me
she
said
turning
on
herr
dremmel
who
was
peering
at
them
what
shall
i
tell
you
madam
he
inquired
politely
sweeping
off
his
felt
hat
and
bowing
beautifully
this
what
is
its
name
i
forgotten
herr
dremmel
who
took
a
large
interest
in
botany
immediately
told
her
of
course
said
the
duchess
i
knew
it
was
arnebia
even
when
i
said
it
was
something
else
it
a
borage
madam
said
herr
dremmel
peering
closer
a
native
of
armenia
of
course
they
conquer
us
remarked
the
duchess
to
the
prebendary
oh
of
course
he
agreed
though
he
did
not
take
her
meaning
for
he
had
been
a
prebendary
some
time
and
was
a
little
slow
intellectually
at
getting
under
way
then
the
duchess
dropped
him
and
turned
entirely
to
herr
dremmel
who
though
he
had
never
seen
a
herbaceous
border
in
his
life
by
sheer
reasoning
was
able
to
tell
her
very
intimately
what
the
bishop
who
he
supposed
did
the
digging
had
been
doing
to
it
the
previous
autumn
and
the
exact
amount
and
nature
of
the
fertilizers
he
had
put
in
she
was
suggesting
he
should
come
back
with
her
that
afternoon
to
coops
and
stay
there
indefinitely
so
profound
and
attractive
did
his
knowledge
seem
of
what
her
own
garden
and
her
farm
needed
in
the
way
of
a
treatment
he
alluded
to
as
when
he
interrupted
her
a
thing
that
had
never
happened
to
her
before
while
inviting
somebody
to
coops
to
inquire
why
there
were
so
very
many
people
in
the
and
on
the
lawn
the
duchess
stared
it
a
party
she
said
to
celebrate
the
betrothal
do
you
know
i
am
gratified
said
herr
dremmel
to
find
the
parents
so
evidently
pleased
it
adds
a
grace
to
what
was
already
full
of
charm
but
would
it
not
have
been
more
complete
if
they
had
invited
me
i
quite
agree
with
you
said
the
duchess
much
more
complete
well
anyhow
here
you
are
so
you
think
my
soil
wants
nitrogen
certainly
madam
in
the
form
of
rape
cape
and
ammonia
salts
but
combined
with
organic
manure
artificial
manure
alone
will
not
in
hot
weather
who
is
that
he
broke
off
pointing
with
his
umbrella
to
the
bishop
advancing
along
the
path
his
eyes
on
the
ground
sardonically
meditating
what
said
the
duchess
intent
on
the
notes
she
was
making
of
his
recommendations
in
her
that
said
herr
dremmel
the
duchess
looked
up
why
the
bishop
of
course
go
on
about
the
hot
weather
her
father
said
herr
dremmel
and
he
advanced
hat
in
hand
and
the
other
held
out
in
friendliest
greeting
to
meet
him
the
duchess
went
after
him
bishop
she
said
this
is
a
man
who
knows
all
the
things
worth
knowing
and
the
bishop
taking
this
to
be
her
introduction
of
a
friend
cordially
returned
herr
dremmel
handshake
he
was
never
cordial
again
sir
said
herr
dremmel
i
am
greatly
pleased
to
make
your
acquaintance
my
name
is
dremmel
robert
dremmel
the
bishop
had
just
enough
not
to
snatch
his
hand
away
but
to
let
herr
dremmel
continue
to
hold
and
press
it
his
mind
began
to
leap
about
how
to
get
the
duchess
away
how
to
get
herr
dremmel
turned
noiselessly
out
of
the
house
how
to
prevent
ingeborg
coming
at
any
moment
along
the
path
behind
them
with
lady
pamela
we
have
every
reason
sir
said
herr
dremmel
holding
the
hand
in
a
firm
pressure
to
congratulate
each
other
i
you
on
the
possession
of
such
a
daughter
you
me
is
she
a
lovely
girl
said
the
duchess
for
whom
only
judith
existed
in
that
family
would
rape
cake
and
the
other
thing
help
my
flowers
at
all
or
is
it
only
for
the
mangels
mangels
thought
the
bishop
rape
cake
and
swiftly
glanced
behind
him
down
the
path
sir
said
herr
dremmel
desiring
to
be
very
pleasant
to
the
bishop
and
slightly
waving
the
duchess
aside
permit
me
also
to
congratulate
you
you
had
any
tea
inquired
the
bishop
desperately
of
the
duchess
turning
to
her
and
getting
his
hand
away
thank
you
yes
well
dremmel
do
interrupt
him
bishop
interesting
on
the
results
continued
herr
dremmel
to
the
bishop
of
your
autumnal
activities
this
blaze
of
flowers
is
sufficient
witness
to
the
devotion
the
assiduity
you
do
suppose
he
did
it
himself
do
you
said
the
duchess
and
your
costume
sir
said
herr
dremmel
concentrated
on
the
bishop
and
earnestly
desiring
to
please
suggests
a
quite
particular
and
familiar
interest
in
what
this
lady
rightly
calls
the
things
really
worth
knowing
but
he
ca
help
wearing
that
said
the
duchess
again
herr
dremmel
and
with
some
impatience
waved
her
aside
it
is
a
costume
most
appropriate
in
a
garden
he
continued
even
the
gaiters
are
horticultural
and
the
apron
is
pleasantly
reminiscent
of
the
innocence
of
our
first
parents
so
adam
might
have
dressed
oh
but
you
come
to
coops
cried
the
duchess
bishop
he
to
come
back
with
me
sir
said
herr
dremmel
with
something
of
severity
for
he
was
beginning
to
consider
the
duchess
forward
is
this
lady
mrs
bishop
oh
oh
screamed
the
duchess
while
herr
dremmel
watched
her
disapprovingly
and
the
bishop
struggled
not
to
seize
him
by
the
throat
my
dear
bishop
said
the
duchess
wiping
her
eyes
i
never
had
such
a
compliment
paid
me
the
bishop
on
the
come
indoors
he
implored
i
ca
really
let
you
stand
about
like
this
thank
you
i
not
in
the
least
tired
go
on
mr
dremmel
sir
can
i
see
you
alone
said
herr
dremmel
now
without
any
doubt
as
to
the
duchess
forwardness
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
before
we
begin
together
openly
to
rejoice
it
seems
fitting
we
should
first
by
ourselves
unless
this
lady
is
your
daughter
mother
oh
oh
again
screamed
the
duchess
the
bishop
turned
on
him
in
a
kind
of
blaze
quite
uncontrollable
yes
sir
you
can
he
said
come
into
my
study
what
are
you
going
to
take
him
away
from
me
cried
the
duchess
my
dear
duchess
if
he
has
business
with
me
said
the
bishop
take
you
indoors
first
he
said
offering
her
his
arm
this
gentleman
he
glared
at
him
sideways
and
herr
dremmel
all
unused
as
he
was
to
noticing
hostility
yet
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
expression
of
his
face
will
wait
here
no
no
he
wo
he
come
too
for
approaching
round
the
bushes
behind
which
grew
the
the
bishop
had
caught
sight
of
skirts
come
on
sir
but
said
the
duchess
as
the
bishop
drew
her
hand
hastily
through
his
arm
and
began
to
walk
her
off
more
quickly
than
she
had
been
walked
off
for
years
come
on
sir
the
bishop
flung
back
almost
hissed
back
at
herr
dremmel
one
moment
said
herr
dremmel
holding
up
his
hand
his
gaze
fixed
on
what
was
emerging
from
the
bushes
come
sir
cried
the
bishop
i
can
only
see
you
alone
if
you
come
at
once
but
herr
dremmel
did
not
heed
him
he
was
watching
the
bushes
will
you
come
said
the
bishop
pausing
and
stamping
his
foot
while
he
held
the
duchess
tight
in
the
grip
of
his
arm
why
said
herr
dremmel
without
heeding
him
why
yes
why
it
why
here
at
last
appears
the
little
sugar
lamb
the
little
said
the
duchess
resolutely
pulling
out
her
hand
from
the
bishop
arm
and
putting
up
her
eyeglass
heavens
above
us
he
ca
mean
pamela
but
nobody
answered
her
and
indeed
it
was
not
necessary
for
herr
dremmel
gone
down
the
path
with
a
swiftness
amazing
in
one
of
his
appearance
was
already
in
the
sight
of
all
redchester
and
most
of
the
county
enfolding
ingeborg
in
his
arms
of
course
was
the
duchess
comment
to
the
bishop
as
she
watched
the
scene
with
her
eyeglass
up
and
the
placidity
of
relief
of
course
they
will
conquer
us
chapter
xi
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
herr
dremmel
armed
only
with
simplicity
set
aside
the
resistances
of
princes
potentates
and
powers
and
was
married
to
ingeborg
by
her
father
the
bishop
in
his
own
cathedral
and
it
was
done
as
quickly
as
the
law
allowed
not
only
because
herr
dremmel
was
determined
it
should
be
but
because
the
enduring
of
his
daily
arrival
for
courting
purposes
from
coops
where
he
was
staying
became
rapidly
impossible
for
the
bishop
also
there
was
the
master
of
ananias
spurred
to
a
frenzy
of
activity
by
herr
dremmel
success
in
getting
things
hurried
on
insisting
that
he
had
been
engaged
long
enough
and
demanding
to
be
married
on
the
same
day
in
the
end
he
was
and
ingeborg
wedding
being
judith
as
well
was
unavoidably
splendid
all
along
the
line
the
bishop
hand
was
forced
the
very
had
to
be
as
beautiful
for
the
one
as
for
the
other
of
his
daughters
and
absurdly
and
wickedly
he
was
obliged
to
spend
as
much
on
her
trousseau
who
was
going
into
pauperdom
and
obscurity
for
the
rest
of
her
days
as
on
hers
who
would
no
doubt
be
soon
though
of
course
only
in
god
good
time
the
most
magnificent
of
widows
he
never
afterwards
was
able
to
feel
quite
the
same
to
the
duchess
without
knowing
anything
of
the
circumstances
of
the
secret
disgrace
of
the
affair
of
the
blank
undesirability
in
any
case
of
such
a
of
the
extraordinary
inconvenience
and
pecuniary
loss
of
ingeborg
marrying
at
all
she
had
taken
up
herr
dremmel
to
an
extent
that
was
positively
near
making
her
ridiculous
supposing
that
humanly
speaking
were
possible
and
had
rammed
him
down
the
county
throat
till
at
last
it
believed
that
of
the
two
husbands
ingeborg
had
secured
the
better
and
this
gossip
filtered
through
into
the
palace
and
judith
who
never
did
speak
spoke
less
than
ever
but
edging
away
more
and
more
decidedly
from
the
blandishments
of
the
master
who
had
not
been
invited
to
coops
spent
most
of
her
time
in
her
own
room
engaged
in
not
looking
at
her
trousseau
and
the
palace
became
such
an
uncomfortable
place
what
with
one
thing
and
another
and
the
strain
of
remaining
calm
and
becoming
in
conduct
to
the
ducally
protected
herr
dremmel
was
so
great
that
at
last
the
bishop
was
as
eager
as
any
one
to
get
the
wedding
over
and
feverishly
furthered
any
scheme
that
would
by
hastening
it
deliver
him
to
ingeborg
he
never
spoke
but
turned
away
with
the
same
cold
horror
that
came
over
the
rest
of
the
family
when
from
windows
he
or
it
beheld
her
being
courted
with
what
seemed
a
terrible
german
thoroughness
in
places
like
the
middle
of
the
lawn
he
could
no
longer
walk
round
his
own
garden
without
meeting
an
interlaced
couple
and
though
he
suggested
to
herr
dremmel
with
what
he
felt
was
really
admirable
that
these
public
endearments
might
give
rise
to
comment
herr
dremmel
merely
replied
that
as
ingeborg
was
his
it
ought
to
give
rise
to
much
more
comment
even
to
justifiable
complaints
if
his
manner
to
her
were
less
warm
in
england
we
do
not
began
the
bishop
but
broke
off
for
fear
of
losing
his
and
herr
dremmel
and
ingeborg
continuing
to
perambulate
the
garden
slowly
with
a
frequent
readjusting
of
their
steps
to
each
other
for
it
is
a
difficult
method
the
interlaced
one
of
getting
along
a
path
the
bishop
and
bullivant
retreated
for
refreshment
and
comfort
to
the
delicacy
of
judith
to
her
lovely
withdrawals
that
the
master
should
blandish
was
natural
because
a
man
is
natural
but
they
knew
that
a
woman
if
she
is
to
approach
any
ideal
of
true
womanhood
can
not
be
too
carefully
unnatural
and
should
she
be
persuaded
or
betrayed
into
some
expression
of
affection
for
her
lover
some
answering
caress
at
least
she
must
not
like
it
and
there
was
ingeborg
progressing
round
the
garden
as
described
or
in
the
middle
of
the
lawn
openly
having
her
hand
held
and
looking
pleased
it
was
rank
illustration
he
could
no
longer
trail
around
his
own
garden
without
meeting
an
interlaced
couple
ingeborg
in
fact
was
pleased
she
was
more
she
was
extremely
happy
here
she
was
suddenly
no
longer
a
disgraced
and
boycotted
and
wicked
girl
but
that
strangely
encouraging
object
that
odd
restorer
of
faith
in
oneself
a
little
sugar
lamb
the
of
being
a
sugar
lamb
she
had
been
so
very
miserable
she
had
dragged
through
such
cold
anæmic
days
she
had
had
such
a
horrible
holiday
forced
upon
her
on
the
very
scene
of
her
activities
and
had
had
it
brought
home
to
her
so
freezingly
so
blightingly
that
she
had
done
too
dreadful
a
thing
to
be
allowed
apparently
ever
again
to
associate
with
the
decent
and
robert
she
quickly
began
calling
him
that
to
herself
under
the
influence
of
her
family
methods
of
reclaiming
her
had
not
written
a
single
letter
but
he
came
said
herr
dremmel
for
whose
enlightenment
she
was
picturing
the
week
she
had
had
and
her
father
would
not
speak
to
her
at
all
would
not
look
at
her
old
sheep
said
herr
dremmel
and
judith
had
seemed
entirely
horrified
and
used
to
blush
if
she
tried
to
speak
to
her
foolish
turkey
said
herr
dremmel
placidly
but
now
somehow
it
did
seem
as
if
she
need
have
been
quite
so
miserable
and
might
have
had
more
faith
what
ought
the
little
one
to
have
had
more
of
asked
herr
dremmel
for
his
thoughts
had
not
much
time
to
spare
and
he
profitably
employed
them
while
she
talked
in
working
out
the
probable
results
of
say
the
treatment
of
three
acres
of
with
sulphate
of
potash
sulphate
of
ammonia
and
nitrate
of
soda
respectively
all
of
them
receiving
lbs
of
basic
slag
as
well
would
not
sulphate
of
ammonia
be
more
effective
as
a
nitrogenous
manure
than
nitrate
of
soda
in
the
case
of
whose
roots
grew
smaller
and
nearer
the
surface
than
mangels
that
is
what
little
women
should
constantly
have
more
of
he
said
breaking
away
from
to
a
zestful
embracing
for
on
this
occasion
they
were
under
the
a
place
she
seldom
went
to
because
she
had
not
yet
acquired
in
spite
of
his
assurances
that
she
undoubtedly
would
any
real
enthusiasm
for
embracings
keeping
by
preference
to
the
only
immune
place
in
the
garden
which
was
the
middle
of
the
lawn
i
wonder
she
thought
while
it
was
being
done
if
this
will
really
grow
on
me
and
while
it
was
still
being
done
mother
must
have
been
kissed
too
and
she
still
alive
and
presently
while
it
was
still
being
done
but
mother
is
alive
there
the
sofa
perhaps
that
why
well
he
loved
her
somehow
she
did
not
now
care
how
whether
it
was
a
spiritual
affection
or
one
that
would
go
on
requiring
at
frequent
intervals
to
enfold
her
capaciously
did
not
matter
any
more
for
it
was
a
warm
thing
a
warm
human
thing
he
was
offering
her
and
she
had
been
with
cold
what
did
it
matter
if
she
herself
was
not
in
love
it
was
the
dream
of
a
schoolgirl
to
want
to
be
in
love
life
was
not
like
that
life
was
a
thing
full
of
friendliness
and
happy
affection
and
love
anyhow
on
the
woman
side
was
not
a
bit
necessary
the
bishop
would
have
been
surprised
if
he
had
known
how
nearly
she
approached
his
ideal
of
womanhood
she
was
going
to
be
so
good
she
said
to
herself
and
to
herr
dremmel
too
her
heart
full
of
gratitude
and
glad
relief
oh
so
good
she
was
never
going
to
be
dejected
or
beaten
out
of
hope
and
courage
again
she
would
work
over
there
work
hard
at
all
sorts
of
happy
things
in
the
parish
and
among
the
poor
and
sick
and
she
would
help
robert
in
his
work
if
he
would
let
her
and
if
he
would
then
she
help
him
when
he
had
done
help
him
to
play
and
rest
they
would
laugh
together
and
talk
together
and
walk
together
and
he
would
explain
his
experiments
to
her
and
teach
her
to
understand
and
the
first
thing
she
would
do
would
be
to
learn
german
very
thoroughly
so
as
to
be
able
to
write
all
his
letters
for
him
and
even
his
sermons
if
needs
be
and
save
his
precious
time
those
said
herr
dremmel
who
in
the
lush
meadows
of
dalliance
had
forgotten
that
what
had
first
attracted
him
to
her
had
been
a
certain
bright
baldness
of
brain
would
be
pretty
little
nonsense
sermons
the
small
snail
would
produce
you
see
said
ingeborg
confidently
and
she
suddenly
flung
out
her
arms
and
turned
her
face
up
to
the
sun
and
the
blue
through
the
little
leaves
and
all
the
light
and
promise
of
the
world
and
stretched
herself
in
an
immense
contentment
oh
she
sighed
is
it
all
it
all
it
is
agreed
herr
dremmel
but
it
is
nothing
to
how
good
it
will
be
presently
when
we
are
surrounded
by
our
dear
children
children
said
ingeborg
she
dropped
her
arms
and
looked
at
him
she
had
not
thought
of
children
then
indeed
my
little
wife
will
not
wish
to
write
letters
or
compose
sermons
why
said
ingeborg
because
you
will
be
a
happy
mother
but
do
happy
mothers
you
will
be
entirely
engaged
in
adoring
your
children
nothing
else
in
the
world
will
interest
you
ingeborg
stood
looking
at
him
with
a
surprised
face
oh
she
said
shall
i
then
she
added
but
i
never
any
children
it
was
not
to
be
expected
said
herr
dremmel
then
how
do
you
know
nothing
else
in
the
world
will
interest
me
foolish
little
one
he
said
taking
her
in
his
arms
his
eyes
moist
with
tenderness
for
he
knew
that
here
against
his
breast
he
held
in
her
slender
youth
the
mother
of
all
the
dremmels
and
the
knowledge
profoundly
moved
him
foolish
little
one
is
not
throughout
all
nature
every
mother
solely
preoccupied
by
interest
in
her
young
is
she
said
ingeborg
doubtfully
quite
a
number
of
remembered
family
snapshots
dancing
before
her
eyes
still
she
was
very
willing
to
believe
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
thinking
but
she
said
gently
pushing
herself
a
little
way
from
him
both
hands
on
his
chest
but
what
then
small
snail
would
they
be
german
children
undoubtedly
said
herr
dremmel
proudly
all
of
them
all
of
them
he
echoed
it
would
be
like
roman
catholics
and
protestants
marrying
and
half
the
children
be
german
and
half
english
certainly
not
said
herr
dremmel
emphatically
but
robert
continue
little
hare
what
are
german
children
it
was
now
herr
dremmel
turn
to
say
confidently
you
see
a
week
later
they
were
married
and
the
bishop
inscrutably
watching
ingeborg
from
the
doorstep
as
she
was
being
tucked
by
deft
hands
into
the
rugs
of
the
car
that
was
to
take
her
to
the
station
observing
how
cushions
were
put
in
the
right
places
at
her
back
how
a
footstool
was
carefully
inserted
under
her
feet
how
her
least
movement
was
interpreted
and
instantly
attended
to
made
his
farewell
remark
to
his
daughter
the
last
remark
as
it
happened
that
he
ever
did
make
to
her
you
will
miss
wilson
he
said
and
the
palace
a
slightly
comforted
man
she
never
saw
him
again
part
ii
chapter
xii
on
her
honeymoon
which
was
only
as
long
as
it
took
to
get
from
redchester
to
kökensee
except
for
a
day
in
holland
where
a
brief
and
infinitely
respectful
visit
or
rather
waiting
on
was
made
to
the
eminent
de
vries
ingeborg
said
to
herself
at
frequent
intervals
as
she
had
said
to
herself
under
the
in
what
now
seemed
a
remote
past
perhaps
this
will
grow
on
me
but
even
before
they
reached
kökensee
on
the
fourth
day
after
their
marriage
she
was
deciding
though
a
little
reluctantly
for
she
had
always
heard
them
praised
that
probably
she
had
no
gift
for
honeymoons
robert
luckily
was
apparently
liking
his
and
was
quite
happy
and
placid
and
slept
sonorously
in
the
trains
the
meals
were
invariably
cheerful
from
bromberg
on
he
woke
up
and
became
attentive
to
the
country
they
were
passing
through
and
once
in
his
own
part
of
the
world
he
expanded
into
much
talk
pointing
out
and
explaining
the
distinctive
features
of
the
methods
employed
on
the
different
farms
along
the
line
ingeborg
drank
it
in
eagerly
she
was
zealous
to
learn
resolute
to
be
a
helpmeet
had
he
not
delivered
her
from
the
immense
suffocation
of
redchester
she
was
obsequious
with
gratitude
it
was
a
country
of
an
exhilarating
spaciousness
no
hedges
no
shutting
off
of
one
field
from
another
no
shutting
off
indeed
of
the
sky
itself
or
of
the
blue
delicious
distance
by
little
interfering
hills
like
those
they
had
round
redchester
it
was
all
one
great
sweep
one
great
roll
of
earth
up
to
heaven
and
of
heaven
down
to
earth
fresh
and
free
and
with
a
quality
in
the
air
of
clear
bright
hardness
she
thought
adorable
after
the
wadded
effect
of
the
climate
at
home
and
once
when
the
train
pulled
up
in
the
open
she
could
hear
from
far
away
up
in
the
blue
the
cry
of
a
hawk
from
allenstein
they
went
on
by
a
light
railway
with
toy
carriages
and
a
tiny
engine
through
an
infinity
of
and
seemingly
uninhabited
country
to
the
nearest
station
to
kökensee
a
place
called
meuk
of
some
pretension
to
being
a
little
town
with
an
enormous
church
rising
out
of
its
middle
and
containing
among
other
objects
of
interest
explained
herr
dremmel
his
mother
oh
said
ingeborg
surprised
have
you
got
one
for
he
somehow
produced
a
completely
motherless
impression
invariably
my
treasure
said
herr
dremmel
with
patience
do
people
have
mothers
yes
she
said
reaching
down
his
hat
for
him
and
putting
it
carefully
on
his
head
but
then
they
say
so
perhaps
sooner
or
later
i
well
remember
however
informing
you
that
my
father
was
dead
from
that
it
was
possible
to
reason
that
my
mother
was
not
she
is
a
simple
woman
no
longer
young
we
will
visit
her
on
our
way
through
the
town
outside
the
station
a
high
vehicle
drawn
by
two
horses
one
of
which
reached
a
head
and
neck
further
than
the
other
so
that
when
you
looked
at
them
sideways
and
could
not
see
that
they
both
began
at
the
same
place
it
seemed
to
be
perpetually
winning
a
race
was
in
readiness
to
take
them
to
kökensee
this
said
herr
dremmel
introducing
it
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
is
my
carriage
and
this
he
continued
similarly
introducing
the
driver
is
my
faithful
servant
johann
he
has
been
with
me
now
nearly
a
year
ingeborg
shook
johann
hand
when
he
had
carefully
clambered
down
over
the
sacks
of
kainit
that
filled
the
front
part
of
the
carriage
very
politely
do
they
all
stay
as
long
as
that
she
murmured
to
herr
dremmel
all
there
is
but
my
widow
and
she
is
adjusting
her
feathers
for
flight
she
will
wing
her
way
to
some
other
bachelor
nest
as
soon
as
my
little
one
has
been
inducted
but
does
she
like
that
asked
ingeborg
for
she
had
acquired
a
habit
due
to
much
repetition
of
the
litany
of
regarding
widowers
as
brittle
needing
special
care
there
was
an
instant
vision
before
her
eyes
of
this
one
flapping
blackly
athwart
the
fields
of
east
prussia
turned
out
desolate
and
oppressed
and
with
perhaps
some
cackling
trail
of
curses
stridulously
marking
her
course
no
doubt
she
will
feel
it
she
too
has
been
very
faithful
she
has
been
with
me
now
nearly
eight
months
but
if
it
were
less
she
would
still
feel
it
widows
he
continued
abstractedly
peering
among
the
sacks
of
kainit
in
search
of
some
chilisaltpetre
that
was
not
there
are
in
a
constant
condition
of
feeling
johann
explained
he
was
a
shabby
man
grown
grey
and
frayed
ingeborg
supposed
in
service
that
the
previous
stuff
did
not
seem
to
have
caught
its
train
and
herr
dremmel
went
off
to
make
anxious
inquiries
of
the
stationmaster
while
ingeborg
stood
smiling
with
an
excessive
friendliness
at
johann
to
make
up
for
her
want
of
words
and
wondering
how
her
luggage
would
get
on
to
a
carriage
already
so
much
occupied
by
sacks
in
the
end
most
of
it
did
not
and
was
left
at
the
station
till
some
future
time
and
clutching
her
with
one
hand
and
the
iron
rail
of
the
carriage
with
the
other
she
was
rattled
away
over
the
enormous
cobbles
of
meuk
with
a
great
cracking
of
johann
whip
and
barking
of
dogs
and
kickings
of
the
horses
whose
tails
were
long
and
kept
on
getting
over
the
reins
the
planks
of
the
carriage
bottom
heaved
and
yawned
beneath
her
feet
the
horses
shied
in
and
out
of
the
gutters
her
hat
wanted
to
blow
off
and
she
did
not
dare
let
either
of
her
hands
go
free
to
hold
it
she
bent
her
head
to
try
to
keep
it
on
her
skin
pricked
and
tingled
from
the
shaking
she
had
an
impression
of
red
houses
flush
with
the
street
railless
dwellings
giving
straight
on
to
it
of
a
small
shop
or
two
of
people
stopping
to
stare
of
straw
and
paper
and
dust
dancing
together
in
the
wind
herr
dremmel
chose
these
flustered
moments
to
expand
conversationally
and
raising
his
voice
above
the
tumult
explained
in
shouts
that
the
three
sacks
in
front
were
not
so
much
sacks
as
mysterious
stomachs
filled
with
the
future
she
strained
to
catch
what
he
said
but
only
heard
a
word
now
and
then
when
she
bumped
against
him
divine
maws
richly
furnished
banquet
potential
energy
she
found
it
difficult
to
answer
with
any
sort
of
connected
intelligence
more
especially
because
he
kept
on
breaking
off
to
lean
forward
and
hit
the
that
alighted
on
the
back
of
johann
neck
when
he
did
this
johann
started
and
the
horses
kicked
faithful
servant
he
shouted
in
her
ear
nearly
a
year
must
not
be
stung
it
was
a
disorganized
and
breathless
ingeborg
trying
to
rub
things
out
of
her
eyes
who
found
herself
finally
in
the
passage
of
the
elder
frau
dremmel
house
the
door
stood
ajar
and
her
husband
pushed
it
open
and
called
loudly
on
his
mother
to
appear
she
lurks
she
lurks
he
said
impatiently
looking
at
his
watch
and
redoubled
his
cries
does
she
expect
us
asked
ingeborg
at
last
who
was
trying
to
pin
up
her
loosened
hair
she
is
a
simple
woman
he
said
consequently
she
never
expects
anything
and
he
pulled
open
a
door
out
of
which
came
nothing
but
darkness
and
a
great
cold
smell
that
is
not
my
mother
he
said
shutting
it
again
does
she
know
we
coming
home
asked
ingeborg
a
doubt
beginning
to
take
hold
of
her
she
is
a
simple
woman
consequently
she
never
knows
anything
mother
mother
does
she
know
you
married
asked
ingeborg
the
doubt
growing
bigger
she
is
a
simple
woman
consequently
he
broke
off
and
stared
down
at
her
reflecting
is
it
possible
that
i
forgot
to
tell
her
he
said
it
evidently
was
possible
for
at
that
moment
frau
dremmel
came
slowly
up
some
steps
at
the
end
of
the
passage
from
a
lower
region
and
perceiving
her
son
and
a
strange
young
woman
stood
still
and
said
nothing
whatever
mother
this
is
my
wife
said
herr
dremmel
taking
ingeborg
hand
and
leading
her
to
the
motionless
figure
said
frau
dremmel
without
moving
kiss
her
little
one
directed
herr
dremmel
yes
yes
said
ingeborg
blushing
a
vivid
red
and
going
a
convulsive
step
nearer
frau
dremmel
was
regarding
her
with
sombre
unblinking
eyes
eyes
that
had
the
blankness
of
pebbles
from
her
waist
downwards
she
wore
a
big
apron
she
was
entirely
undecorated
her
black
dress
ended
at
the
neck
abruptly
in
its
own
binding
and
a
hook
and
eye
her
hair
was
drawn
back
into
the
smallest
of
knobs
ingeborg
felt
suddenly
that
she
herself
was
a
thing
of
a
showy
thing
bedizened
with
a
white
collar
and
a
hat
she
had
till
then
considered
neat
but
that
she
now
knew
for
a
monstrous
piece
of
frippery
crushed
on
to
insufficiently
hair
you
are
married
to
her
asked
the
elder
frau
dremmel
turning
her
pebble
eyes
slowly
from
one
to
the
other
undoubtedly
said
herr
dremmel
and
to
ingeborg
in
english
kiss
her
little
one
and
we
will
go
on
home
he
himself
put
his
arm
round
his
mother
shoulder
and
gave
her
a
hasty
kiss
my
wife
is
english
he
said
she
does
not
yet
either
speak
or
understand
our
tongue
kiss
her
mother
and
we
will
go
on
home
but
it
did
not
seem
possible
to
get
the
two
women
to
kiss
ingeborg
went
another
shy
step
nearer
frau
dremmel
remained
immobile
this
said
frau
dremmel
moving
her
slow
eyes
over
ingeborg
and
then
fixing
them
on
her
son
is
a
pastor
wife
illustration
you
are
married
to
her
asked
the
elder
frau
dremmel
turning
her
pebble
eyes
slowly
from
one
to
the
other
undoubtedly
i
regret
i
omitted
to
tell
you
mother
but
one
does
occasionally
omit
and
in
english
to
ingeborg
she
is
a
simple
woman
consequently
but
i
heard
said
frau
dremmel
through
your
housekeeper
and
others
thus
i
heard
of
my
only
son
marriage
i
a
widow
ingeborg
not
understanding
stood
smiling
nervously
she
thought
on
such
an
occasion
somebody
ought
to
smile
but
she
did
not
like
doing
it
the
immobility
of
frau
dremmel
who
moved
nothing
but
her
eyes
the
dank
bare
passage
the
rush
of
cold
smell
that
had
escaped
out
of
the
one
door
in
it
the
bleak
air
of
poverty
about
her
poverty
in
some
strange
way
regarding
itself
as
virtuous
for
no
reason
except
that
it
was
poor
did
not
make
her
smiling
easy
but
she
was
a
bride
just
coming
home
just
being
introduced
to
her
husband
people
somebody
she
felt
on
such
an
occasion
must
smile
and
trained
as
she
had
been
by
her
father
to
do
the
things
no
one
else
wanted
to
do
she
provided
all
the
smiling
for
the
entirely
herself
please
robert
tell
your
mother
how
sorry
i
am
i
ca
talk
she
said
do
tell
her
i
wish
i
were
so
dumb
how
much
has
she
frau
dremmel
was
asking
across
this
speech
enough
enough
said
her
son
putting
on
his
hat
and
making
movements
of
departure
ah
i
am
not
to
know
more
secrets
it
is
all
to
go
in
further
unchristian
tampering
with
god
harvests
herr
dremmel
bestowed
a
second
abstracted
kiss
somewhere
on
his
head
he
had
not
listened
to
anything
she
said
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
nothing
for
the
mother
she
went
on
no
no
the
mother
is
only
a
widow
she
is
of
no
account
yet
your
sainted
father
farewell
and
god
be
with
you
said
herr
dremmel
departing
down
the
passage
and
forgetting
in
his
hurry
to
get
his
bride
home
as
quickly
as
possible
to
take
her
with
him
for
a
moment
she
was
left
alone
confronting
her
new
relation
she
made
a
great
plunge
into
filialness
and
swiftly
blushing
picked
up
her
passive
hand
she
had
meant
to
kiss
it
but
looking
into
her
eyes
she
found
kissing
finally
impossible
she
shyly
murmured
an
english
and
got
herself
infinitely
awkwardly
out
of
the
house
one
has
to
have
them
was
herr
dremmel
only
comment
kökensee
lay
three
miles
along
the
highroad
between
meuk
and
wiesenhausen
and
they
could
see
the
spire
of
its
little
church
over
the
fields
on
the
left
the
whole
way
the
road
made
with
as
few
curves
as
possible
undulated
gently
up
and
down
between
it
was
carefully
planted
on
each
side
with
mountain
ashes
on
that
day
in
full
flower
and
was
white
and
hard
as
though
there
had
been
no
rain
for
a
long
while
the
wind
blew
gaily
over
the
rye
the
sky
was
flecked
with
small
white
clouds
ingeborg
could
see
for
miles
and
there
were
dark
lines
of
forest
and
flashes
of
yellow
where
the
broom
grew
and
shining
bits
of
water
and
larks
quivering
out
joy
and
everywhere
on
the
higher
places
busy
windmills
and
the
whole
world
seemed
to
laugh
and
flutter
and
sing
it
beautiful
oh
beautiful
she
said
beautiful
i
tell
you
what
is
beautiful
little
one
the
fat
red
soil
of
your
girlhood
home
the
fat
red
soil
and
the
steady
drip
drip
of
the
heavens
and
he
bent
forward
and
inquired
of
johann
when
it
had
rained
last
and
became
very
gloomy
on
hearing
that
it
was
three
weeks
ago
and
said
things
to
himself
in
german
they
seemed
to
be
unpastoral
things
for
ingeborg
saw
johann
ears
lifted
up
by
what
was
evidently
in
the
front
of
his
face
being
a
grin
a
with
one
bent
arm
pointed
crookedly
down
a
at
right
angles
to
the
road
and
with
a
lurch
and
a
heave
they
tilted
round
the
corner
there
was
an
immediate
ceasing
of
sound
she
could
now
hear
all
sorts
of
little
birds
singing
besides
larks
chaffinches
tits
the
carriage
ploughed
along
slowly
through
the
deep
sand
between
rye
that
grew
more
reluctantly
every
yard
the
horses
were
completely
sobered
and
covered
with
sweat
before
them
on
an
upward
slope
was
kökensee
one
long
straggling
street
of
low
cottages
lying
up
against
the
sunset
its
church
behind
it
and
near
the
church
two
linden
trees
which
were
the
trees
she
knew
for
she
had
often
made
him
tell
her
in
front
of
her
home
ingeborg
felt
a
quick
tug
at
her
heart
here
was
the
place
containing
all
her
future
there
was
nothing
left
to
her
to
feel
she
supposed
that
she
would
not
feel
here
the
years
lay
spread
out
before
her
spacious
untouched
canvases
on
which
she
was
presently
going
to
paint
the
picture
of
her
life
it
was
to
be
a
very
beautiful
picture
she
said
to
herself
with
an
extraordinary
feeling
of
proud
confidence
not
beautiful
because
of
any
gifts
or
skill
of
hers
for
never
was
a
woman
more
giftless
but
because
of
all
the
untiring
little
touches
the
ceaseless
care
for
detail
the
patient
painting
out
of
mistakes
and
every
touch
and
every
detail
was
going
to
be
aglow
with
the
bright
colours
of
happiness
exulting
bits
out
of
the
the
book
she
knew
altogether
best
sang
in
her
ears
up
your
hearts
we
lift
them
up
unto
the
lord
our
oh
the
beautiful
words
the
beautiful
world
the
wonder
and
the
radiance
of
life
when
the
devil
said
herr
dremmel
who
had
been
scanning
the
crops
on
either
side
of
the
track
with
deepening
depression
took
our
saviour
up
on
to
a
high
place
to
tempt
him
with
the
offer
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
he
was
careful
to
hide
kökensee
by
keeping
his
tail
spread
out
over
it
it
was
so
ugly
and
so
undesirable
oh
the
devil
said
ingeborg
shrugging
her
shoulder
in
a
splendid
contempt
her
face
still
shining
with
what
she
had
been
thinking
she
turned
to
him
and
laughed
you
ca
expect
to
know
what
she
said
slipping
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
throwing
up
her
head
in
a
kind
of
proud
glee
he
smiled
down
at
her
little
treasure
he
said
for
a
moment
becoming
conscious
that
this
was
a
very
bright
thing
he
had
got
and
was
bringing
home
with
him
the
carriage
was
hauled
up
through
an
opening
between
two
cottages
out
of
the
sand
on
to
the
stones
of
the
village
street
by
a
supreme
last
effort
of
the
horses
and
was
dragged
in
great
bumps
across
various
defects
through
an
open
gate
on
the
opposite
side
there
was
a
yard
with
sheds
a
plough
a
manure
heap
some
geese
some
hens
a
pig
the
two
linden
trees
and
in
between
the
linden
trees
behind
wire
netting
a
house
like
a
venerable
bungalow
which
herr
dremmel
on
their
drawing
up
in
front
of
it
introduced
to
her
my
house
he
said
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
chapter
xiii
there
followed
a
time
of
surprising
happiness
for
ingeborg
it
was
the
happiness
of
the
child
escaped
from
its
lessons
and
picnicking
gloriously
in
freedom
and
unrebukedness
the
widow
it
is
true
slightly
smudged
the
brightness
of
the
beginning
by
as
it
were
dying
hard
her
body
clung
to
life
the
life
she
had
known
she
lamented
for
eight
long
months
she
was
the
last
she
explained
of
the
herr
pastor
widows
who
reached
back
in
a
rusty
row
to
the
days
when
he
first
came
elastic
with
youth
to
cure
the
souls
of
kökensee
and
as
she
had
stayed
the
longest
it
was
clear
she
must
be
the
best
she
remained
at
the
parsonage
dingily
persistent
for
several
days
on
the
pretext
of
initiating
ingeborg
into
the
ways
of
the
house
and
each
time
herr
dremmel
who
seemed
a
little
shy
of
embarking
on
controversy
with
her
mentioned
trains
she
burst
in
his
presence
into
prayer
and
implored
aloud
on
his
behalf
that
he
might
never
know
what
it
was
to
be
a
widow
she
did
ultimately
however
become
dislodged
and
once
she
was
gone
there
was
nothing
but
contentment
ingeborg
was
young
enough
to
think
the
almost
servantless
housekeeping
a
thing
of
charm
and
humour
herr
dremmel
was
of
the
easiest
unconcern
as
to
what
or
when
or
if
he
ate
it
was
early
summer
and
there
was
only
delight
in
getting
up
at
dawn
and
pottering
about
the
kitchen
before
the
daily
servant
came
a
girl
known
to
kökensee
as
müller
ilse
and
heating
water
and
making
coffee
and
preparing
a
very
clean
little
somewhere
in
the
garden
and
decorating
it
with
freshly
picked
flowers
and
putting
the
butter
on
young
leaves
and
arranging
the
jar
of
honey
so
that
a
shaft
of
sunlight
between
the
branches
shone
straight
through
it
turning
it
into
a
miracle
of
golden
light
it
was
the
sort
of
one
reads
about
in
story
books
and
on
its
fragility
herr
dremmel
would
presently
descend
like
some
great
geological
catastrophe
and
the
whole
in
a
few
convulsed
moments
would
be
just
crumbs
and
coffee
stains
then
he
would
put
on
leggings
and
go
off
with
johann
to
his
experimental
fields
and
she
would
give
herself
up
eagerly
to
the
duties
of
the
day
she
could
not
talk
at
first
to
ilse
a
square
girl
with
surprisingly
thick
legs
because
though
she
went
about
always
with
a
german
grammar
in
one
hand
she
found
that
what
she
had
learned
was
never
what
she
wanted
to
say
ilse
whose
skirt
was
short
did
not
wear
stockings
and
when
ingeborg
by
pointing
and
producing
a
pair
had
conveyed
to
her
that
it
would
be
well
if
she
did
ilse
raised
her
voice
and
said
that
she
had
no
money
to
get
a
husband
with
but
at
least
and
sei
she
had
these
two
fine
legs
and
if
the
frau
pastor
demanded
that
she
should
by
hiding
them
give
up
her
chances
then
the
frau
pastor
had
best
seek
some
girl
on
whom
they
grew
crooked
or
lean
and
who
for
those
reasons
would
only
be
too
glad
to
cover
them
up
ingeborg
not
understanding
a
word
but
apprehending
a
great
objection
smiled
benevolently
and
put
the
stockings
away
and
ilse
legs
went
on
being
bare
they
worked
together
in
great
harmony
for
there
could
be
no
argument
cut
off
from
conversation
they
sang
and
ingeborg
sang
hymns
because
her
memory
was
packed
with
them
and
ilse
sang
long
loud
ballads
going
through
them
slowly
verse
by
verse
in
a
sort
of
steady
howl
the
very
geese
paused
on
their
way
to
the
pond
to
listen
anxiously
dinner
which
ingeborg
found
convenient
to
prepare
entirely
in
one
pot
simmered
placidly
on
the
stove
from
twelve
onwards
anybody
who
was
hungry
went
and
ate
it
you
threw
in
potatoes
and
rice
and
bits
of
meat
and
carrots
and
cabbages
and
fat
and
salt
and
there
you
were
what
are
these
mysterious
difficulties
of
housekeeping
she
asked
herself
that
people
shake
their
heads
over
her
dinners
were
wholesome
always
delicious
if
one
were
hungry
and
quite
amazingly
hot
they
stayed
hot
as
persistently
as
poultices
and
once
when
ilse
had
the
misfortune
to
be
stung
by
a
wasp
on
one
of
her
admirable
legs
ingeborg
with
immense
presence
of
mind
seized
the
dinner
and
emptying
it
into
a
fair
linen
cloth
bound
it
over
the
swollen
place
so
that
when
herr
dremmel
arrived
as
it
happened
hungrily
that
day
about
two
and
asked
for
his
dinner
he
was
told
it
was
on
ilse
leg
and
had
to
eat
sandwiches
he
could
not
but
admire
the
resourcefulness
of
ingeborg
but
it
was
not
until
he
had
eaten
several
sandwiches
that
he
was
able
still
to
say
as
he
patted
her
shoulder
little
treasure
it
was
the
busiest
happiest
time
every
minute
of
the
day
was
full
it
was
life
at
first
hand
not
drained
dry
of
its
elemental
excellences
by
being
squeezed
first
through
the
medium
of
servants
to
have
a
little
kitchen
all
to
yourself
to
be
really
mistress
of
every
corner
of
your
house
to
watch
the
career
of
your
food
from
its
very
beginning
to
run
out
into
the
garden
and
pull
up
anything
you
happened
to
want
to
stand
at
the
back
door
with
your
skirt
full
of
grain
and
call
your
own
chickens
round
you
and
feed
them
to
go
yourself
and
look
for
eggs
to
fill
the
funny
little
dark
rooms
with
flowers
and
measure
the
passage
for
a
drugget
you
would
presently
order
in
the
only
carpet
shop
you
had
faith
in
which
was
the
one
in
redchester
what
pleasures
did
the
world
contain
that
could
possibly
come
up
to
these
things
were
a
little
untidy
but
what
did
that
matter
it
was
possible
to
become
the
slave
of
things
possible
to
miss
life
in
preparation
for
living
and
the
weather
was
so
beautiful
at
least
ingeborg
thought
it
was
there
was
the
hottest
sun
and
the
coolest
wind
and
bright
starry
nights
it
is
true
robert
when
he
scanned
the
naked
heavens
the
last
thing
at
night
and
peered
at
the
thermometer
outside
his
window
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
said
it
was
the
devil
own
weather
and
that
if
there
was
not
soon
some
rain
all
his
fertilizers
all
his
activities
all
his
expenditure
would
be
wasted
but
though
this
would
throw
a
shadow
for
a
moment
across
her
joy
in
each
new
wonderful
morning
she
found
it
impossible
not
to
rejoice
in
the
light
out
in
the
garden
for
instance
down
there
beyond
the
at
the
end
where
you
could
stand
in
the
gap
in
the
lilac
hedge
and
look
straight
out
across
the
the
immense
unending
dipping
and
rising
delicate
grey
delicate
green
shining
in
sunlight
dark
beneath
a
cloud
restlessly
waving
on
and
on
till
over
away
at
the
end
of
things
they
got
to
the
sky
and
were
only
stopped
by
brushing
up
against
it
out
there
with
one
hand
shading
one
eyes
from
the
too
great
brightness
who
could
find
fault
with
anything
who
could
do
anything
but
look
and
see
that
it
was
all
very
good
oh
but
it
good
it
made
one
want
to
sing
the
te
deum
or
the
magnificat
or
still
better
that
hymn
of
exultation
praise
thee
we
bless
thee
we
worship
thee
we
glorify
thee
we
give
thanks
to
thee
for
thy
great
whenever
there
was
a
spare
half
hour
such
as
between
where
dinner
ended
and
tea
began
she
would
run
out
to
the
and
pacing
up
and
down
that
leafy
place
with
the
gooseberry
bushes
and
vegetables
and
straggling
accidental
flowers
of
the
garden
lying
hotly
in
the
sun
between
her
and
the
back
of
the
house
she
learned
german
words
by
heart
she
learned
them
aloud
from
her
grammar
saying
them
over
and
over
again
glibly
mechanically
while
her
thoughts
danced
about
the
future
from
the
immediate
future
of
what
she
would
do
the
future
of
an
afternoon
in
the
punt
among
the
reeds
and
perhaps
paddling
along
to
where
the
forest
began
to
the
more
responsible
vaguer
future
of
further
down
the
months
when
armed
with
german
she
would
begin
among
the
poor
and
go
out
into
the
parish
and
make
friends
with
the
peasants
and
be
a
real
pastor
wife
particularly
she
wished
to
get
nearer
her
it
seemed
to
her
to
be
her
first
duty
to
get
near
her
ceaselessly
she
trotted
up
and
down
repeating
the
german
for
giants
umbrellas
keys
spectacles
wax
fingers
thunder
beards
princes
boats
and
shoulders
ceaselessly
her
lips
moved
while
her
eyes
followed
the
movements
of
the
birds
darting
in
and
out
of
the
lilac
hedge
and
hopping
among
the
crumbs
where
breakfast
had
been
and
through
her
giants
umbrellas
keys
spectacles
and
wax
she
managed
not
to
miss
a
word
the
were
chirping
to
each
other
in
cheerful
strophe
and
antistrophe
little
bit
of
bread
and
no
a
little
bit
of
bread
and
no
at
four
she
would
go
in
and
make
some
coffee
by
the
simple
method
of
uniting
the
coffee
to
hot
water
and
leaving
them
to
settle
down
together
on
the
mat
outside
the
laboratory
locked
door
herr
dremmel
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
once
he
was
in
there
and
she
would
steal
down
the
passage
on
biting
her
in
the
intentness
of
her
care
that
no
rattling
of
the
things
on
the
tray
should
reach
his
ears
when
he
was
in
the
house
all
singing
ceased
she
arranged
that
ilse
should
do
her
outdoor
duties
then
clean
out
the
milk
the
cow
whether
it
wanted
to
be
milked
or
not
and
minister
to
the
pig
johann
was
away
all
day
at
the
experiment
ground
and
ilse
waded
about
the
farmyard
mess
with
her
bare
legs
thoroughly
enjoying
herself
for
no
one
ever
scolded
her
whatever
she
did
and
the
yard
was
separated
from
the
village
street
only
by
a
low
fence
and
the
early
manhood
of
kökensee
as
it
passed
could
pause
and
lean
on
this
and
learn
from
her
manner
of
solacing
the
pig
the
comfortableness
of
the
solacements
awaiting
her
husband
at
seven
ilse
went
home
and
ingeborg
prepared
a
supper
so
much
like
breakfast
that
nobody
could
have
told
it
was
evening
and
not
morning
except
that
the
ray
of
sunshine
fell
through
the
honey
from
the
west
instead
of
the
east
and
there
was
cheese
at
this
meal
herr
dremmel
full
of
his
fertilizers
was
mostly
in
a
profound
abstraction
he
drank
the
coffee
with
which
he
was
becoming
saturated
and
ate
great
slices
of
bread
and
cheese
in
an
impenetrable
silence
ingeborg
sat
throwing
crumbs
to
the
birds
and
watching
the
sky
at
the
edge
of
the
world
grow
first
a
mighty
red
then
fade
then
light
up
into
clear
green
and
long
after
the
shadows
beneath
the
were
black
and
the
stars
and
the
bats
were
out
and
the
frogs
down
in
the
reeds
of
the
lake
and
the
occasional
creaking
of
the
village
pump
were
all
that
one
could
hear
outside
the
immense
stillness
they
would
go
on
sitting
there
herr
dremmel
silently
smoking
ingeborg
silently
making
plans
sometimes
she
would
get
up
and
cross
over
to
him
and
bend
her
face
down
close
to
his
and
try
in
the
dark
to
explore
his
eyes
with
hers
the
you
make
she
would
say
brushing
a
kiss
so
much
used
does
marriage
make
one
to
what
once
has
seemed
impossible
across
the
top
of
his
hair
and
he
would
wake
up
and
smile
and
pat
her
shoulder
and
tell
her
she
was
a
good
little
wife
then
she
felt
proud
it
was
just
what
she
wanted
to
be
a
good
little
wife
she
wanted
to
give
satisfaction
to
be
as
helpful
to
him
as
she
had
been
to
her
father
in
the
days
before
her
disgrace
and
more
helpful
for
he
was
so
much
kinder
he
was
so
dear
for
this
extraordinary
happiness
for
this
delicious
safety
from
disapproval
for
these
free
fearless
wonderful
days
she
would
give
in
return
all
she
had
all
she
was
all
she
could
teach
herself
and
train
herself
to
be
nearly
always
herr
dremmel
went
back
to
his
laboratory
about
ten
and
worked
till
after
midnight
and
she
would
lie
awake
in
the
funny
bare
bedroom
across
the
passage
as
long
as
she
could
so
as
not
to
miss
too
much
of
life
by
being
asleep
smelling
with
the
delight
delicate
sweet
smells
gave
her
the
various
fragrances
of
the
resting
garden
and
the
stars
blinked
in
through
the
open
window
and
she
could
see
the
faint
whiteness
of
a
bush
of
guelder
roses
against
the
curtain
of
the
brooding
night
when
herr
dremmel
came
in
he
shut
the
window
on
sundays
there
was
a
service
at
two
once
a
fortnight
on
the
alternating
sundays
herr
dremmel
was
driven
by
johann
to
another
village
three
miles
distant
which
was
part
of
his
scattered
parish
and
here
he
preached
the
sermon
he
had
preached
to
kökensee
the
sunday
before
he
practised
a
rigorous
economy
in
sermons
and
it
had
this
advantage
that
an
enthusiast
only
there
was
no
enthusiast
by
waiting
a
week
and
walking
three
miles
most
of
which
was
deep
sand
might
hear
again
anything
that
had
struck
him
the
previous
week
by
waiting
a
year
indeed
the
same
enthusiast
supposing
him
there
could
hear
everything
again
for
herr
dremmel
sermons
numbered
and
were
planned
to
begin
on
january
with
the
circumcision
and
leaping
along
through
the
fortnights
of
the
year
ended
handsomely
and
irregularly
with
an
extra
one
at
christmas
however
inattentive
a
member
of
the
congregation
might
be
as
the
years
passed
over
him
he
knew
the
sermons
they
were
sermons
weighty
according
to
the
season
either
with
practical
advice
or
with
wrathful
expositions
of
duty
there
was
one
every
year
when
the
threshing
time
was
at
hand
on
the
text
micah
iv
and
explaining
with
patient
exactitude
the
newest
methods
of
doing
it
there
was
the
annual
harvest
sermon
on
matthew
part
of
verse
after
yet
another
year
of
the
obstinate
indifference
to
chemical
manure
there
was
the
sermon
on
jeremiah
ix
there
no
physician
there
preached
yearly
on
one
of
the
later
sundays
in
trinity
when
the
cold
continuous
rains
of
autumn
were
finding
out
the
weak
spots
in
the
parish
grandparents
and
the
peasants
having
observed
that
once
one
called
in
a
doctor
the
sick
person
got
better
and
one
had
to
pay
the
doctor
into
the
bargain
evaded
calling
him
in
if
they
possibly
could
inquiring
of
each
other
gloomily
how
one
was
to
live
if
death
were
put
a
stop
to
and
there
was
the
advent
sermon
when
the
annual
slaughter
of
pigs
drew
near
on
isaiah
part
of
the
verse
this
sermon
filled
the
church
in
spite
of
the
poor
opinion
of
pigs
in
both
the
old
and
new
testaments
where
herr
dremmel
found
on
searching
for
a
text
they
were
hardly
mentioned
except
as
convenient
receptacles
for
devils
in
his
parishioners
lives
they
provided
the
nearest
indeed
the
only
approach
to
the
finer
emotions
to
gratitude
love
wonder
the
peasant
watching
this
pink
chalice
of
his
future
joys
this
mysterious
moving
crucible
into
which
whatever
dreary
dregs
and
leavings
he
threw
uttermost
dregs
of
uttermost
dregs
that
even
his
lean
dog
would
not
touch
they
still
by
christmas
emerged
as
sausages
could
not
but
feel
at
least
some
affection
at
least
some
little
touch
of
awe
while
his
relations
were
ill
and
having
to
have
either
a
doctor
or
a
funeral
and
sometimes
rousing
him
to
fury
both
or
if
not
ill
were
well
and
requiring
food
and
clothing
his
pig
walked
about
pink
and
naked
giving
no
trouble
needing
no
money
spent
on
it
placidly
transmuting
into
the
fat
of
future
feastings
that
which
without
it
would
have
become
in
heaps
a
source
of
flies
and
corruption
herr
dremmel
on
pigs
was
full
of
intimacy
and
local
warmth
he
was
more
he
was
magnificent
it
was
the
sermon
in
the
year
which
never
failed
to
fill
every
seat
and
it
was
the
one
day
on
which
kökensee
felt
its
pastor
thoroughly
understood
it
ingeborg
went
diligently
to
church
whenever
there
was
church
to
go
to
she
explained
to
herr
dremmel
that
she
held
it
to
be
her
duty
as
the
pastor
wife
to
set
an
example
in
this
matter
and
he
pinched
her
ear
and
replied
that
it
might
possibly
be
good
for
her
german
he
seemed
to
think
nothing
of
her
duty
as
a
pastor
wife
and
when
she
suggested
that
perhaps
she
ought
to
begin
and
go
the
rounds
of
the
cottages
and
not
wait
for
greater
stores
of
language
he
only
remarked
that
little
women
duty
is
to
make
their
husbands
happy
but
do
i
she
asked
confidently
seizing
his
coat
in
both
her
hands
of
course
see
how
sleek
i
become
and
i
can
do
something
besides
that
nothing
so
good
nothing
half
so
good
but
robert
one
thing
does
exclude
herr
dremmel
had
already
however
ceased
to
listen
his
thoughts
had
slid
off
again
she
seemed
to
sit
in
his
mind
on
the
top
of
a
slope
up
which
he
occasionally
clambered
and
caressed
her
eagerly
on
these
visits
she
would
buttonhole
him
with
talk
and
ask
him
questions
so
that
he
might
linger
but
even
while
she
his
gaze
would
become
abstracted
and
off
he
slid
leaving
her
peering
after
him
over
the
edge
filled
with
a
mixture
of
affection
respect
for
his
work
pride
in
him
and
amusement
you
might
as
well
try
she
thought
to
buttonhole
water
and
she
would
laugh
and
go
back
to
whatever
she
was
doing
with
a
blithe
feeling
that
it
was
very
ideal
this
perfect
independence
of
one
another
this
spaciousness
of
freedom
to
do
exactly
what
each
one
liked
the
immense
tracts
of
time
she
had
how
splendid
this
leisure
was
after
the
close
detail
of
every
hour
at
home
in
her
father
study
when
she
had
got
over
the
first
difficulties
of
german
and
need
no
longer
devote
most
of
her
day
to
it
she
would
get
books
from
england
and
read
and
read
all
the
ones
she
had
wanted
to
read
but
had
not
been
allowed
to
oh
the
magnificence
of
marriage
thought
ingeborg
beating
her
hands
together
the
splendour
of
its
liberations
she
would
go
off
in
the
morning
with
the
punt
full
of
books
and
spend
long
glorious
days
away
in
the
forest
lying
on
the
green
springy
carpet
of
whortleberries
reading
she
would
most
diligently
work
at
furnishing
her
empty
mind
she
would
sternly
endeavour
to
train
it
not
to
jump
all
the
books
she
possessed
she
had
brought
with
her
and
spread
over
the
the
which
had
enriched
her
with
hardy
and
meredith
and
kipling
and
tennyson
and
ruskin
and
her
own
books
she
had
had
as
a
girl
these
were
three
the
given
to
her
on
her
confirmation
by
her
father
given
her
on
her
eighteenth
birthday
by
her
mother
and
dumas
given
her
as
a
prize
for
french
because
judith
did
not
know
any
one
summer
when
a
french
governess
was
introduced
thoughtlessly
the
bishop
said
afterwards
into
the
palace
this
lady
had
been
removed
from
the
palace
again
a
little
later
with
care
every
corner
of
her
room
being
scrupulously
disinfected
by
the
searching
of
richards
who
found
however
nothing
except
one
book
in
a
yellow
paper
cover
called
et
lulu
mœurs
du
and
even
this
was
not
in
her
room
at
all
but
in
judith
beneath
some
stockings
herr
dremmel
took
up
one
of
the
wedding
volumes
when
first
he
saw
them
in
the
and
turned
its
pages
it
was
shaving
of
tut
tut
he
said
presently
putting
it
down
why
robert
asked
ingeborg
eager
to
hear
what
he
thought
but
he
patted
her
abstractedly
already
slid
off
again
down
into
regions
of
reality
the
regions
in
which
his
brain
incessantly
worked
out
possible
chemical
combinations
and
forgot
with
a
completeness
that
sometimes
even
surprised
himself
that
he
had
a
wife
invariably
however
he
found
it
pleasant
on
to
remember
her
she
asked
to
be
shown
his
experimental
fields
and
he
took
her
with
him
very
amiably
one
hot
morning
promising
to
explain
them
to
her
but
instantly
on
reaching
them
he
became
absorbed
and
after
she
had
spent
an
hour
sitting
on
a
stone
at
the
edge
of
a
strip
of
lupins
beneath
a
haggard
little
fir
tree
which
gave
the
solitary
bit
of
shade
in
that
burning
desert
watching
him
going
up
and
down
the
different
strips
examining
apparently
every
single
plant
with
johann
she
began
to
think
she
had
better
go
home
and
look
after
the
dinner
and
waving
a
to
him
which
he
did
not
see
she
went
a
day
or
two
later
she
asked
whether
it
would
not
be
good
and
pleasant
that
his
mother
should
come
over
to
tea
with
them
soon
he
replied
amiably
that
it
would
be
neither
good
nor
pleasant
she
asked
whether
it
might
not
be
a
duty
of
theirs
to
invite
her
he
replied
after
consideration
perhaps
she
asked
whether
he
did
not
love
his
mother
he
replied
unhesitatingly
no
she
then
went
and
sat
on
his
knee
and
caught
hold
of
his
ears
and
pulled
his
head
up
so
that
he
should
look
at
her
but
robert
she
said
well
little
sheep
since
their
marriage
he
had
instinctively
left
off
calling
her
a
lamb
the
universe
which
for
a
time
she
had
managed
to
reduce
into
just
a
setting
for
one
little
female
thing
had
arranged
itself
into
its
proper
lines
again
the
lamb
had
become
a
sheep
a
little
one
but
yet
no
longer
and
never
again
a
lamb
he
was
glad
he
had
been
able
to
be
so
thoroughly
in
love
he
was
glad
he
had
so
promptly
applied
the
remedy
of
marriage
his
affection
for
his
wife
was
quite
satisfactory
it
was
calm
it
was
deep
it
interfered
with
nothing
she
held
the
honourable
position
he
had
always
even
at
his
most
enamoured
moments
known
she
would
ultimately
fill
the
position
next
best
in
his
life
after
the
fertilizers
his
house
so
long
murky
with
widows
was
now
a
bright
place
because
of
her
approaching
poetry
he
likened
her
to
a
little
flitting
busy
bird
in
spring
always
he
was
pleased
when
she
came
and
perched
on
his
knee
well
little
sheep
he
said
smiling
at
her
as
she
looked
very
close
into
his
eyes
her
face
seen
so
near
was
charming
in
its
delicate
detail
in
its
young
perfection
of
texture
and
colouring
scrutinizing
her
eyes
he
was
glad
to
notice
once
again
how
intelligent
they
were
presently
there
would
be
sturdy
boys
tumbling
about
the
garden
with
eyes
like
that
grey
and
honest
and
intelligent
his
boys
carrying
on
far
more
efficiently
the
work
he
had
begun
well
little
sheep
he
said
suddenly
moved
one
to
love
one
mother
she
asked
perhaps
but
one
does
not
do
you
oh
poor
mother
said
ingeborg
quickly
her
mother
far
away
was
already
becoming
a
rather
sad
and
a
quite
tender
memory
all
those
days
and
years
on
a
sofa
and
all
the
days
and
years
still
to
come
now
she
knew
better
now
that
she
was
married
herself
what
it
must
have
been
like
to
be
married
to
the
bishop
to
have
twenty
years
of
unadulterated
bishop
she
no
longer
wondered
at
the
sofa
she
was
full
of
understanding
and
pity
one
does
no
doubt
at
the
beginning
said
herr
dremmel
and
then
leaves
off
is
that
all
children
are
born
for
that
they
may
leave
off
loving
us
he
became
cautious
he
talked
of
the
general
and
the
individual
of
many
mothers
and
some
mothers
of
the
mothers
of
the
present
generation
he
called
them
the
and
the
mothers
of
the
generation
to
be
born
he
called
them
the
and
presently
as
she
sat
rather
enigmatically
silent
on
his
knee
he
developed
affection
for
his
mother
explaining
that
no
doubt
it
had
always
been
there
but
like
many
other
good
things
when
life
was
busy
and
a
man
had
little
time
to
go
back
and
stir
them
had
lain
dormant
and
he
now
thought
indeed
he
recognised
that
it
would
be
excellent
to
urge
her
to
come
over
soon
and
spend
an
afternoon
or
still
better
a
morning
but
you
not
here
in
the
morning
said
ingeborg
ah
that
is
true
i
am
present
however
at
dinner
but
nobody
ever
knows
when
i
might
perhaps
arrive
early
in
this
way
the
elder
frau
dremmel
who
had
her
pride
to
consider
as
the
widow
of
her
neglectful
son
traditionally
appreciative
father
and
who
would
consequently
never
have
taken
what
she
called
in
her
broodings
the
first
step
did
about
seven
weeks
after
the
marriage
cross
the
threshold
of
her
home
chapter
xiv
the
visit
was
arranged
to
begin
the
following
friday
at
four
for
ingeborg
thought
the
afternoon
feeling
was
altogether
more
favourable
to
warmth
than
anything
you
were
likely
to
get
before
midday
and
johann
drove
in
to
meuk
to
fetch
frau
dremmel
in
time
for
that
hour
there
was
to
be
tea
out
in
the
garden
the
first
thing
because
tea
lubricates
the
charities
and
then
with
the
aid
of
a
dictionary
conversation
ingeborg
had
had
time
to
think
out
her
and
was
firm
in
her
resolve
that
no
artificial
barrier
such
as
language
should
stand
in
the
way
of
the
building
up
of
affection
if
necessary
she
might
even
weave
the
german
for
giants
umbrellas
keys
and
spectacles
into
a
sentence
as
a
conversational
opening
and
try
her
with
that
and
if
frau
dremmel
showed
the
least
responsiveness
to
either
of
these
subjects
she
might
go
on
to
wax
fingers
thunder
and
beards
and
end
with
princes
boats
and
shoulders
that
would
be
three
sentences
she
could
not
help
thinking
they
would
be
pregnant
with
conversational
possibilities
there
would
be
three
replies
and
frau
dremmel
being
in
her
own
language
would
of
course
enlarge
then
ingeborg
would
open
her
dictionary
and
look
up
the
words
salient
in
the
enlargement
and
when
she
had
found
them
smile
back
brightly
comprehending
and
appreciative
this
including
having
tea
would
take
she
supposed
about
fifty
minutes
then
they
would
walk
a
little
up
and
down
in
the
shade
pointing
out
the
to
each
other
and
that
would
be
another
ten
minutes
perhaps
then
at
five
she
supposed
frau
dremmel
would
ask
for
and
obtain
the
carriage
and
go
away
again
ingeborg
made
up
her
mind
to
kiss
her
at
the
end
when
the
visit
had
reached
the
doorstep
stage
it
would
not
be
difficult
she
thought
the
doorstep
she
well
knew
was
a
place
of
enthusiasms
she
and
ilse
were
immensely
active
the
whole
morning
preparing
both
of
them
imbued
with
much
the
same
spirit
with
which
as
children
they
prepared
parties
for
their
dolls
but
this
was
a
live
doll
who
was
coming
and
they
were
making
real
cakes
which
she
would
actually
eat
the
cakes
were
of
a
variety
of
shapes
or
rather
contortions
the
coffee
was
of
a
festival
potency
sandwiches
meant
to
be
delicate
and
slender
were
cut
but
under
the
very
knife
grew
bulky
it
must
be
the
strong
german
air
ingeborg
thought
watching
them
perplexed
by
this
conduct
and
there
were
the
first
gooseberries
when
the
table
was
set
out
under
the
and
finished
off
with
a
jug
of
roses
she
gazed
at
her
work
in
admiration
and
the
further
she
got
away
from
it
the
more
delightful
it
looked
nearer
it
was
still
attractive
but
more
with
the
delusive
attractiveness
of
tables
at
a
school
treat
perhaps
there
was
too
much
food
she
thought
perhaps
it
was
the
immense
girth
of
the
sandwiches
but
down
from
the
end
of
the
path
it
looked
so
charming
that
she
wished
she
could
paint
it
in
watercolours
the
great
trees
the
tempered
sunlight
the
glimpse
of
the
old
church
at
one
end
the
glimpse
of
the
embosomed
lake
at
the
other
and
in
the
middle
set
out
so
neatly
with
such
a
grace
of
spotlessness
the
table
of
her
first
frau
dremmel
arrived
in
a
black
bonnet
with
a
mauve
flower
in
its
front
to
mark
that
ten
years
had
been
at
work
upon
the
mitigation
of
her
grief
her
son
came
out
of
his
laboratory
when
he
heard
the
crashes
of
the
carriage
among
the
stones
and
holes
of
the
village
street
and
he
was
ready
at
the
door
to
help
her
down
he
was
altogether
silent
for
he
had
been
torn
from
the
middle
of
counting
and
weighing
the
grains
in
samples
of
differently
treated
rye
and
would
have
to
begin
the
last
saucerful
all
over
again
beside
this
brevity
ingeborg
in
a
white
frock
and
wearing
the
buckled
shoes
of
youth
with
the
sun
shining
on
her
freckled
fairness
and
bare
neck
and
her
mouth
framed
into
welcoming
smiles
looked
like
a
child
she
certainly
did
not
look
like
wife
and
the
last
thing
in
the
world
that
she
at
all
resembled
was
the
wife
of
a
german
pastor
again
frau
dremmel
as
she
had
done
that
day
at
meuk
turned
her
eyes
slowly
all
over
her
while
she
was
receiving
her
son
abstracted
kiss
but
she
said
nothing
except
to
her
son
and
passively
submitted
to
ingeborg
shaking
both
her
hands
which
were
clothed
in
the
black
cotton
of
decent
widowhood
do
say
something
robert
murmured
ingeborg
say
how
glad
i
am
say
all
the
things
i
say
if
i
could
say
things
herr
dremmel
gazed
at
his
wife
a
moment
collecting
his
thoughts
why
should
one
say
anything
he
said
she
is
a
simple
woman
no
longer
young
my
wife
he
said
to
his
mother
desires
me
to
welcome
you
on
her
behalf
said
frau
dremmel
ingeborg
began
to
usher
her
along
the
passage
towards
the
back
door
and
the
garden
frau
dremmel
however
turned
aside
down
it
into
the
oh
not
in
there
cried
ingeborg
we
going
to
have
tea
in
the
garden
robert
please
tell
her
but
looking
round
for
help
she
found
robert
had
gone
and
there
was
the
sound
of
a
key
being
turned
in
a
lock
frau
dremmel
continued
to
enter
the
before
she
could
be
stopped
she
had
arranged
herself
firmly
on
its
sofa
but
tea
said
ingeborg
following
her
and
gesticulating
tea
you
know
out
there
in
the
garden
she
pointed
to
the
door
and
she
pointed
to
the
window
frau
dremmel
slowly
took
off
her
gloves
and
rolled
them
together
and
undid
her
bonnet
strings
and
looked
at
the
door
and
at
the
window
and
back
again
at
her
but
did
not
move
then
ingeborg
making
a
great
effort
at
gay
cordiality
and
determined
that
when
words
failed
affectionate
actions
should
fill
up
the
gaps
bent
over
the
figure
on
the
sofa
and
took
its
arm
wo
you
come
she
said
adding
a
sentence
she
had
taken
special
pains
to
get
by
heart
and
smilingly
but
yet
when
it
came
to
touching
her
rather
gingerly
and
certainly
with
her
heart
in
her
mouth
she
gently
pulled
at
her
sleeve
frau
dremmel
stared
up
at
her
without
moving
tea
garden
better
said
ingeborg
still
smiling
but
now
quite
hot
she
could
not
remember
a
single
german
word
except
frau
dremmel
urged
and
encouraged
was
finally
got
out
of
the
house
and
into
the
garden
and
along
between
the
gooseberry
bushes
to
where
the
stood
and
an
armchair
for
her
with
a
cushion
on
it
she
went
with
plain
reluctance
she
did
not
cease
to
stare
at
her
especially
her
gaze
lingered
on
her
feet
becoming
aware
of
this
ingeborg
tried
to
hide
them
but
you
can
not
hide
feet
that
are
being
walked
on
and
when
she
sat
down
to
pour
out
the
coffee
she
found
her
short
skirt
was
incapable
of
hiding
anything
lower
than
above
her
ankles
she
grew
nervous
she
spilt
the
milk
and
dropped
a
spoon
beside
the
rigid
figure
in
the
armchair
she
seemed
and
felt
terribly
fluid
and
uncontrolled
the
cheek
that
was
turned
to
her
flushed
hotly
she
acutely
knew
her
was
observing
this
and
that
made
it
hotter
if
only
thought
ingeborg
she
would
look
at
something
else
or
say
something
over
the
rim
of
her
cup
however
frau
eyes
moved
up
and
down
and
round
and
through
the
strange
creature
her
son
had
married
the
rest
of
her
was
almost
wholly
motionless
ingeborg
had
nervously
swallowed
three
cups
of
the
black
stuff
before
frau
dremmel
was
half
through
one
at
last
a
german
word
flashed
into
her
mind
and
she
flung
herself
on
it
she
cried
waving
her
hands
comprehensively
over
all
the
scenery
for
an
instant
frau
dremmel
removed
her
eyes
from
her
warm
and
quivering
body
to
follow
her
gesture
but
seeing
nothing
soon
got
them
back
again
she
made
no
comment
on
the
scenery
her
face
remained
wholly
impassive
and
ingeborg
realized
that
the
would
be
no
use
as
a
means
of
entertainment
illustration
especially
her
gaze
lingered
on
her
feet
becoming
aware
of
this
ingeborg
tried
to
hide
them
she
could
not
again
say
and
the
meal
went
on
in
silence
frau
dremmel
method
of
eating
it
was
to
begin
a
piece
of
each
of
the
cakes
and
immediately
leave
it
off
this
afflicted
ingeborg
who
had
supposed
them
to
be
very
lovely
cakes
frau
dremmel
place
at
the
table
she
had
pulled
her
chair
close
up
to
it
was
asterisked
with
begun
and
abandoned
cakes
on
the
other
hand
she
ate
many
of
the
sandwiches
and
they
drew
forth
the
only
word
she
said
to
ingeborg
during
the
whole
of
tea
said
frau
dremmel
removing
her
eyes
for
one
moment
from
ingeborg
to
the
sandwiches
that
were
being
offered
her
and
with
a
dingy
investigating
forefinger
lifting
up
that
portion
of
each
sandwich
which
may
be
described
as
its
lid
said
ingeborg
responsively
delighted
at
this
flicker
of
life
it
was
however
the
only
one
after
it
silence
complete
and
impenetrable
settled
down
on
frau
dremmel
she
did
not
even
speak
to
her
son
when
half
an
hour
later
he
came
out
in
search
of
the
coffee
he
had
failed
to
find
on
his
doormat
her
manners
prevented
her
in
his
house
on
this
first
visit
after
his
marriage
from
uttering
the
unmanageable
truths
that
come
so
naturally
from
the
mouths
of
neglected
mothers
and
except
for
those
she
had
nothing
to
say
to
him
herr
dremmel
expected
nothing
his
deeply
engaged
thoughts
left
no
room
in
him
for
anything
but
a
primitive
simplicity
he
was
hungry
and
he
ate
thirsty
and
he
drank
the
silent
figure
at
the
table
of
whose
presence
every
nerve
in
ingeborg
body
was
conscious
produced
no
impression
on
him
whatever
robert
do
tell
your
mother
how
i
really
want
to
talk
to
her
if
only
i
could
said
ingeborg
pressing
her
hands
together
in
her
lap
and
tying
and
untying
her
handkerchief
into
knots
there
were
little
beads
on
her
upper
lip
the
rings
of
hair
on
her
temples
were
quite
damp
he
glanced
at
his
mother
drawn
up
and
taut
in
her
chair
and
immediately
she
turned
her
eyes
on
to
him
and
stared
back
at
him
steadily
little
one
he
said
i
have
told
you
she
is
a
simple
woman
not
used
to
or
capable
of
wielding
the
weapons
of
social
arts
be
simple
too
and
all
will
be
well
but
i
being
simple
protested
ingeborg
i
dumb
i
blank
what
can
i
be
simpler
than
that
then
all
is
well
give
me
coffee
he
ate
and
drank
in
silence
and
got
up
to
go
away
again
frau
dremmel
looked
at
him
and
said
something
is
it
the
carriage
asked
ingeborg
she
wants
to
go
indoors
said
herr
dremmel
indoors
she
says
she
does
not
like
mosquitoes
he
went
away
into
the
house
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
follow
as
they
reached
the
back
door
the
church
clock
struck
five
but
ingeborg
glancing
at
her
impassive
face
saw
this
sound
meant
nothing
to
her
she
followed
her
into
the
and
watched
her
helplessly
as
she
arranged
herself
once
more
on
the
sofa
when
the
clock
struck
five
she
was
still
on
it
she
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
what
was
she
waiting
ingeborg
asked
herself
whose
handkerchief
was
now
rubbed
into
a
hard
ball
between
her
nervous
hands
impossible
either
to
move
her
or
communicate
with
her
rigidly
she
sat
her
eyes
examining
the
room
and
each
object
in
it
but
yet
not
for
an
instant
missing
the
least
of
her
movements
ingeborg
seized
her
dictionary
and
grammar
and
made
a
final
effort
to
build
a
bridge
out
of
them
across
which
their
souls
might
even
now
go
out
to
meet
each
other
but
frau
dremmel
did
not
seem
to
understand
the
nature
of
her
efforts
and
only
stared
with
a
deepened
blankness
when
ingeborg
read
her
out
a
sentence
from
the
grammar
that
dealt
with
weather
they
were
not
that
day
having
what
was
she
waiting
for
seven
struck
and
still
she
waited
the
clock
in
the
room
ticked
through
the
minutes
and
every
half
hour
they
could
hear
the
church
clock
striking
ingeborg
brought
her
a
footstool
brought
her
a
cushion
brought
her
in
extremity
a
glass
of
water
began
to
sew
at
a
torn
duster
left
off
sewing
at
it
fluttered
nervously
among
the
pages
of
her
grammar
pored
in
her
dictionary
and
always
frau
dremmel
watched
her
she
found
herself
struggling
against
a
tendency
to
think
of
her
as
it
at
seven
she
heard
ilse
go
home
singing
happy
ilse
able
to
go
away
soon
afterwards
she
finally
faltered
into
immobility
giving
up
sitting
now
quite
still
herself
in
her
chair
the
flush
faded
from
her
cheek
pale
and
crumpled
it
was
her
and
robert
soon
it
would
be
their
bedtime
quite
soon
it
would
be
and
then
it
would
be
next
week
and
then
there
would
be
winter
coming
on
was
this
visit
never
to
end
at
eight
it
at
last
became
plain
to
her
that
what
frau
dremmel
was
waiting
for
must
be
supper
this
was
terrible
for
there
was
none
at
least
there
was
only
that
repetition
of
tea
and
breakfast
that
made
her
and
robert
lives
so
wholesome
she
had
calculated
the
visit
on
the
basis
of
tea
only
and
had
prepared
only
and
elaborately
for
that
for
half
an
hour
she
sat
on
and
hoped
she
was
mistaken
she
did
not
know
that
in
east
prussia
if
you
are
invited
to
tea
you
also
stay
to
supper
but
at
eight
she
realised
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
and
fetch
it
in
when
the
ruins
of
the
same
meal
that
had
been
offered
her
once
already
were
produced
a
second
time
and
set
out
clumsily
on
the
unaccustomed
table
among
the
merediths
and
kiplings
the
bones
of
this
skeleton
being
slowly
put
together
under
her
very
eyes
and
ingeborg
at
last
by
ceasing
to
go
in
and
out
fetching
things
and
sinking
into
a
chair
indicated
that
that
was
all
frau
dremmel
after
waiting
a
little
longer
opened
her
mouth
and
startled
her
by
speech
said
frau
dremmel
ingeborg
sat
up
quickly
after
the
hours
of
silence
it
was
uncanny
said
frau
dremmel
again
did
you
did
you
speak
said
ingeborg
staring
at
her
said
frau
dremmel
a
third
time
ingeborg
jumped
up
and
ran
across
the
passage
to
the
laboratory
door
robert
robert
she
cried
twisting
the
handle
come
come
quickly
your
mother
she
talking
she
saying
things
there
was
the
same
excitement
and
wonder
in
her
voice
as
there
is
in
that
of
a
parent
whose
baby
has
suddenly
and
for
the
first
time
said
papa
herr
dremmel
came
out
at
once
from
the
sound
of
her
he
felt
something
must
have
happened
she
seized
him
and
pulled
him
into
the
now
listen
she
said
holding
him
there
facing
the
sofa
herr
dremmel
looked
perplexed
what
is
it
little
one
he
asked
listen
she
say
it
again
soon
said
ingeborg
eagerly
what
is
it
mother
he
asked
in
german
frau
dremmel
without
moving
her
head
ran
her
eyes
over
the
table
are
there
not
even
not
even
she
began
but
stopped
she
was
evidently
combating
an
emotion
thunder
of
heaven
said
herr
dremmel
looking
from
one
woman
to
the
other
what
is
it
but
frau
dremmel
was
not
able
after
the
hours
of
waiting
for
a
supper
that
seemed
to
her
in
every
detail
a
studied
insult
on
her
part
to
bear
harshness
from
her
son
drawing
out
a
handkerchief
that
had
no
end
and
that
reached
to
her
eyes
while
yet
remaining
in
her
pocket
she
began
to
cry
ingeborg
was
appalled
she
ran
to
her
and
kneeling
down
begged
her
in
english
to
tell
her
what
was
the
matter
she
called
her
over
and
over
again
she
stroked
her
sleeve
she
patted
her
she
even
laid
her
head
on
her
lap
but
frau
dremmel
for
the
first
time
did
not
notice
her
she
was
saying
detached
things
into
her
handkerchief
and
they
were
all
for
her
son
a
widow
wept
frau
dremmel
a
widow
for
ten
years
when
i
think
of
your
dear
father
how
much
he
thought
of
me
my
first
visit
my
visit
on
your
marriage
treated
as
though
i
were
anybody
forced
to
drink
coffee
out
of
doors
like
a
homeless
animal
no
sofa
no
real
table
flocks
of
mosquitoes
no
supper
no
supper
at
all
nothing
prepared
for
me
for
the
mother
for
your
sainted
father
wife
his
cherished
wife
long
before
you
were
thought
of
if
it
had
not
been
for
me
you
would
not
have
been
here
at
all
nor
she
and
i
am
to
go
home
unfed
uncared
for
not
even
the
least
one
has
a
right
to
expect
given
one
not
even
what
the
poorest
peasant
has
each
night
not
even
again
she
said
the
magic
word
there
there
said
ingeborg
soothingly
stroking
her
anxiously
there
there
robert
what
but
never
mind
never
mind
said
frau
dremmel
wiping
her
eyes
only
to
weep
afresh
soon
i
shall
be
with
him
with
him
again
with
your
dear
father
and
this
this
is
nothing
all
nothing
it
is
only
the
will
of
god
there
there
said
ingeborg
anxiously
stroking
her
chapter
xv
it
was
not
until
some
days
later
that
she
discovered
the
reason
for
her
tears
she
could
get
no
information
from
herr
dremmel
his
thoughts
were
not
to
be
pinned
a
minute
to
such
a
subject
he
swept
her
questionings
away
with
the
wave
of
the
arm
of
one
who
sweeps
his
surroundings
clear
of
rubbish
and
the
most
that
could
be
extracted
from
him
was
a
general
observation
as
to
the
small
amount
of
good
to
be
obtained
from
proximities
but
ingeborg
one
afternoon
walking
longer
than
usual
facing
the
hot
sun
and
the
flies
and
sand
of
the
road
beyond
the
village
to
see
where
it
led
to
instead
of
as
she
generally
did
exploring
footpaths
in
the
forest
came
after
much
heat
and
exertion
to
a
thicket
of
trees
that
were
not
firs
or
pines
but
green
cool
things
oaks
and
acacias
and
silver
birches
and
going
through
them
along
a
road
fanning
herself
with
her
hat
as
she
walked
in
the
pleasant
shade
found
herself
stopped
by
a
white
gate
a
notice
telling
her
she
was
not
to
advance
further
and
a
garden
beyond
the
flower
beds
and
long
untidy
grass
of
this
garden
she
saw
a
big
house
built
high
on
a
terrace
on
the
terrace
a
dog
was
lying
panting
with
its
tongue
out
nothing
else
alive
was
in
sight
and
there
were
no
sounds
except
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
over
her
head
and
such
faint
chirping
as
birds
make
in
july
who
lives
in
that
big
white
house
away
over
there
she
asked
herr
dremmel
when
next
she
saw
him
which
was
not
till
that
evening
at
supper
and
she
nodded
her
head
her
hands
being
full
of
the
coffee
pot
in
the
direction
of
the
north
herr
dremmel
was
ruffled
he
had
been
plunged
in
parish
affairs
since
breakfast
for
it
was
the
day
appointed
by
him
and
recurring
once
a
fortnight
into
which
by
skilful
organizing
he
packed
them
all
the
world
in
consequence
on
every
second
tuesday
appeared
to
him
a
place
of
folly
people
were
born
and
lived
embedded
in
ancient
folly
the
folly
of
their
parents
already
stale
when
they
got
it
was
handed
down
to
them
intact
not
shot
at
all
thought
herr
dremmel
on
these
alternate
tuesdays
with
the
smallest
ray
of
perception
of
different
and
better
things
the
school
children
were
still
learning
about
bismarck
birthday
the
schoolmaster
was
still
laboriously
computing
attendances
and
endeavouring
to
obey
the
difficult
law
which
commanded
him
to
cane
the
absent
the
elders
of
the
church
were
still
refusing
to
repair
the
steeple
in
time
the
confirmation
class
was
still
meeting
explanations
and
exhortations
with
thick
inattention
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
were
still
demanding
detailed
reports
of
progress
when
there
was
not
and
could
not
be
progress
couples
were
still
forgetting
marriage
until
the
last
hurried
moment
and
then
demanding
it
with
insistent
cries
infants
were
still
being
hastily
christened
before
the
same
neglects
that
killed
those
other
infants
who
else
might
have
been
their
proud
and
happy
grandparents
carried
them
off
and
peasants
were
still
slinking
away
at
the
bare
mention
of
intelligence
and
manure
he
was
exceedingly
ruffled
for
while
he
had
been
wrestling
with
these
various
acquiescences
and
evasions
his
real
work
was
lying
neglected
out
there
in
the
sun
in
there
in
the
laboratory
and
a
whole
day
of
twelve
precious
hours
was
gone
for
ever
and
when
ingeborg
said
who
lives
in
that
big
white
house
herr
dremmel
with
his
wasted
day
behind
him
and
the
continued
brassiness
of
the
heavens
above
him
and
the
persistence
in
that
place
of
trees
of
mosquitoes
stared
at
her
a
moment
and
then
said
bringing
his
hand
down
violently
on
the
table
hell
and
devils
who
said
ingeborg
we
must
call
on
them
at
once
what
my
patron
he
will
be
incensed
that
i
have
not
presented
you
sooner
i
forgot
him
that
will
be
another
day
lost
these
claims
these
social
claims
he
got
up
and
took
some
agitated
steps
about
the
table
no
sooner
he
said
frowning
angrily
at
the
path
has
one
settled
one
thing
than
there
appears
another
all
day
the
poor
all
day
the
rich
do
we
call
continuously
all
day
both
equally
obstinate
both
equally
encased
from
head
to
foot
in
the
impenetrable
thick
armour
of
intellectual
sloth
how
he
inquired
turning
to
her
with
all
the
indignant
wrath
of
the
thwarted
worker
is
a
man
to
work
if
he
lives
in
a
constant
social
whirl
ingeborg
sat
regarding
him
with
astonishment
he
ca
she
said
but
do
we
whirl
robert
would
one
call
what
we
do
here
whirling
what
when
my
work
has
been
neglected
all
day
on
behalf
of
the
poor
and
will
be
neglected
all
day
on
behalf
of
the
rich
but
why
will
it
take
us
all
day
a
man
must
prepare
he
can
not
call
as
he
is
he
must
said
herr
dremmel
with
irritable
gloom
and
he
added
with
still
greater
irritation
and
gloom
there
has
to
be
a
clean
shirt
but
began
ingeborg
he
waved
her
into
silence
i
do
not
like
he
said
with
a
magnificent
sweep
of
his
arm
clean
shirts
she
stared
at
him
with
the
parted
lips
of
interest
i
am
not
at
home
in
them
i
am
not
myself
in
a
clean
shirt
for
at
least
the
first
two
hours
do
let
call
said
ingeborg
we
so
happy
as
we
are
nay
said
herr
dremmel
immediately
brought
to
reason
by
his
support
of
his
unreason
but
we
must
call
there
are
duties
no
decent
man
neglects
and
i
am
a
decent
man
i
will
send
a
messenger
to
inquire
if
our
visit
will
be
acceptable
i
will
put
on
my
shirt
early
in
order
to
get
used
to
it
and
i
will
endeavour
by
a
persistent
amiability
so
long
as
the
visit
lasts
to
induce
my
patron
to
forget
that
i
forgot
him
herr
dremmel
had
for
some
time
past
been
practising
forgetting
his
patron
he
had
found
this
course
after
divers
differences
of
opinion
simplest
and
most
convenient
the
patron
baron
glambeck
of
glambeck
was
a
serious
real
christian
who
believed
that
the
poor
should
like
some
vast
pudding
that
will
not
otherwise
turn
out
well
be
constantly
stirred
up
and
he
was
unable
to
approve
of
a
pastor
who
except
in
church
and
on
every
alternate
tuesday
forbore
to
stir
it
was
for
this
forbearance
however
that
herr
dremmel
was
popular
in
the
parish
before
his
time
there
had
been
a
constant
dribble
of
pastor
all
over
it
making
it
never
a
moment
safe
from
intrusion
herr
pastor
dremmel
might
be
fiery
in
the
pulpit
but
he
was
quite
quiet
out
of
it
he
was
like
a
good
watchdog
savage
in
its
kennel
and
indifferent
when
loose
kökensee
had
as
one
man
refused
to
support
the
patron
when
he
had
wished
some
time
before
to
bring
about
herr
dremmel
removal
its
pastor
did
not
go
from
house
to
house
giving
advice
its
pastor
was
invisible
and
absorbed
these
were
great
things
in
a
clergyman
and
should
not
lightly
be
let
go
nothing
could
be
done
in
the
face
of
the
parish
opposition
and
kökensee
kept
its
pastor
but
baron
glambeck
ceased
to
patronise
divine
service
in
kökensee
and
until
herr
dremmel
brought
ingeborg
to
make
his
wedding
call
he
had
had
no
word
with
him
for
three
years
the
dremmels
had
announced
themselves
for
four
and
when
they
drove
up
to
the
house
along
the
shady
grass
road
and
through
the
white
gate
they
were
met
on
the
steps
of
the
terrace
by
a
servant
who
if
he
had
been
in
redchester
would
have
been
wilson
on
the
top
of
the
steps
stood
baron
glambeck
tightly
in
black
formal
grave
further
back
beneath
the
glass
roof
of
the
terrace
stood
his
wife
tightly
in
black
formal
grave
they
were
both
if
ingeborg
had
known
it
extremely
correct
according
to
the
standards
of
their
part
of
the
country
they
were
unadorned
smoothed
out
black
she
abundant
in
her
smoothness
he
spare
in
his
and
they
greeted
ingeborg
with
exactly
the
cordiality
suitable
to
the
reception
of
one
pastor
new
wife
who
ought
to
have
been
brought
to
call
long
ago
but
was
not
in
any
way
responsible
for
those
bygones
which
studded
their
memory
so
disagreeably
in
connection
with
her
husband
a
cordiality
with
the
chill
on
dignity
and
coats
of
arms
pervaded
the
place
monograms
with
coronets
were
embroidered
and
painted
on
everything
one
sat
on
or
touched
the
antlers
of
deer
shot
by
the
baron
with
the
dates
and
places
of
their
shooting
affixed
to
each
bristled
thickly
on
the
walls
they
saw
no
servant
who
was
not
a
man
please
take
your
hat
off
said
the
baroness
in
english
carefully
keeping
her
voice
slightly
on
the
side
of
coldness
ingeborg
was
very
nearly
frightened
she
would
have
been
quite
frightened
if
she
had
been
less
well
trained
by
the
bishop
in
unimportance
she
had
however
owing
to
this
training
left
off
being
shy
years
before
she
had
so
small
an
opinion
of
herself
that
there
was
no
room
in
her
at
all
for
and
she
arrived
at
the
glambecks
in
her
usual
condition
of
excessive
naturalness
ready
to
talk
ready
to
be
pleased
and
interested
but
it
was
conveyed
to
her
instantly
on
seeing
the
baroness
there
was
an
astonishment
in
the
way
she
looked
at
her
that
her
clothes
were
not
right
and
just
the
request
or
suggestion
or
demand
she
did
not
know
which
of
these
it
really
was
that
she
should
take
off
her
hat
made
her
realise
she
was
on
new
ground
in
places
where
the
webs
of
strange
customs
were
thick
about
her
feet
she
was
for
a
moment
very
nearly
frightened
you
will
be
more
comfortable
said
the
baroness
without
your
hat
she
took
it
off
obediently
glancing
beneath
her
eyelashes
as
she
drew
out
the
pins
at
the
baroness
smooth
black
head
and
unwrinkled
black
body
perceiving
with
the
clearness
of
a
revelation
that
that
was
how
she
ought
to
look
herself
skimpier
of
course
for
the
years
had
not
yet
had
their
will
with
her
but
she
ought
to
be
a
version
of
the
effect
done
in
lean
she
resolved
in
her
thirst
after
fulfilled
duty
to
get
a
black
dress
and
practise
she
thought
it
wisest
not
to
think
what
her
hair
must
be
looking
like
when
her
hat
was
off
for
she
had
not
expected
to
be
hatless
and
well
did
she
know
it
by
nature
for
a
straggler
a
thing
inclined
to
wander
from
the
grasp
of
hairpins
and
go
off
on
its
own
account
into
wantonings
and
rings
which
were
all
the
more
conspicuous
because
of
their
lurid
approach
in
colouring
to
the
beards
of
her
ancestors
scandinavians
who
walked
the
earth
in
their
strength
hung
according
to
the
way
the
light
took
them
with
beards
that
were
either
the
colour
of
flames
or
of
apricots
or
of
honey
well
if
they
make
her
take
her
hat
off
by
the
time
she
was
on
the
sofa
she
was
presently
put
on
in
the
inner
hall
she
had
caught
up
with
her
usual
condition
of
naturalness
again
and
sat
on
it
interested
and
forgetful
of
self
the
baroness
eyes
wandered
over
her
and
they
wandered
over
her
with
much
the
same
quality
in
their
look
that
had
been
in
her
and
always
when
they
got
to
her
feet
they
lingered
her
skirt
again
reached
only
to
her
ankles
all
her
outdoor
skirts
did
that
but
i
ca
help
feet
thought
ingeborg
noticing
this
they
were
small
by
nature
and
the
artful
shoes
of
the
london
shoemaker
who
had
shared
in
providing
her
and
judith
trousseau
made
them
seem
still
smaller
she
did
not
try
to
hide
them
as
she
had
tried
when
frau
dremmel
stared
it
was
frau
dremmel
heavy
silence
that
had
unnerved
her
these
people
talked
and
the
baroness
english
was
reassuringly
good
nobody
the
baroness
was
thinking
and
also
simultaneously
the
baron
who
was
fit
to
be
a
pastor
wife
had
feet
like
that
little
incapable
feet
nobody
indeed
who
was
a
really
nice
woman
had
them
one
left
off
having
them
when
one
was
a
child
and
never
had
them
again
the
errands
of
domesticity
on
which
one
ran
the
perpetual
up
and
down
of
stairs
the
hours
standing
on
the
cold
stone
floor
of
servants
quarters
seeing
that
one
was
not
cheated
the
innumerable
honourable
activities
that
beautified
and
dignified
womanhood
necessitated
large
loose
shoes
a
true
wife
feet
should
have
room
to
spread
and
flatten
feet
were
one
of
those
numerous
portions
of
the
body
that
had
been
devised
by
an
creator
for
use
and
not
show
as
for
the
rest
of
the
frau
pastor
appearance
there
were
it
is
true
some
young
ladies
in
the
country
who
dressed
rather
like
that
in
the
summer
but
they
were
ladies
in
the
glambeck
set
ladies
of
family
or
married
into
family
that
the
person
who
had
married
one
pastor
a
man
whose
father
had
been
of
such
obscure
beginnings
and
indeed
continuations
that
even
his
having
been
dead
ten
years
hardly
made
him
respectable
should
dress
in
this
manner
was
a
catastrophe
already
they
had
suffered
too
much
from
the
conduct
of
their
unchristian
pastor
and
now
instead
of
bringing
a
neat
woman
in
black
to
be
presented
to
them
a
neat
woman
with
a
gold
chain
perhaps
round
her
high
black
collar
it
being
a
state
occasion
and
she
after
all
newly
married
but
only
a
very
light
chain
and
inherited
not
bought
and
a
dress
so
sufficient
that
it
reached
beyond
and
enveloped
anything
she
might
possess
in
the
way
of
wrist
or
ankle
or
throat
here
was
the
most
unsuitable
wife
he
could
have
chosen
short
of
course
of
marrying
among
jews
while
as
for
her
hair
when
it
came
to
her
hair
their
thoughts
ceased
to
formulate
that
small
and
flattened
and
disordered
head
like
a
boy
head
run
wild
like
something
on
fire
which
emerged
when
she
took
off
her
hat
coffee
was
served
on
the
big
table
in
front
of
the
sofa
the
baroness
sat
beside
ingeborg
and
the
baron
and
herr
dremmel
drew
up
chairs
opposite
the
coffee
was
good
and
there
was
one
excellent
cake
no
gooseberries
no
flowers
no
unwieldy
sandwiches
just
plainness
and
excellence
the
two
men
talked
to
each
other
not
to
the
women
the
baron
stiffly
and
on
his
guard
herr
dremmel
taking
immense
pains
to
be
amiable
and
not
offend
between
them
hung
the
memories
of
altercations
between
them
also
hung
the
knowledge
of
the
three
years
during
which
the
baron
and
his
wife
as
a
result
of
the
last
and
hottest
difference
of
opinion
had
attended
divine
service
in
a
church
that
did
not
belong
to
them
they
had
altogether
cut
kökensee
for
three
years
their
private
gallery
in
the
church
in
which
their
ancestors
had
once
a
fortnight
feared
god
had
been
a
place
where
mice
enjoyed
themselves
its
chairs
were
covered
with
dust
its
growing
brown
still
lay
open
at
the
place
the
glambecks
had
praised
god
out
of
last
such
a
withdrawal
of
approval
would
have
made
any
other
pastor
life
a
thing
of
chill
and
bleakness
herr
dremmel
hardly
observed
it
he
had
no
vanities
he
was
pleased
that
the
rival
pastor
should
be
gratified
he
cared
nothing
for
comment
and
had
no
eye
for
shrugs
and
smiles
his
eyes
his
thoughts
were
wanted
for
his
work
and
he
found
it
a
relief
a
release
from
at
least
one
interruption
when
his
patron
took
to
leaving
him
frigidly
alone
indeed
when
he
drove
up
to
the
glambecks
house
and
remembered
he
had
not
had
to
go
there
for
three
peaceful
years
he
felt
really
grateful
and
he
showed
his
gratitude
by
performing
immense
feats
of
social
pleasantness
during
the
visit
he
agreed
gigantically
with
everything
the
baron
said
whatever
subject
was
touched
upon
cautiously
for
the
baron
mistrusted
all
subjects
with
herr
dremmel
he
instantly
dragged
it
off
the
dangerous
shoals
of
the
immediate
and
close
up
to
a
cosmic
height
and
distance
a
height
and
distance
so
enormous
that
even
what
the
kaiser
said
last
became
a
negligible
tinkling
and
conscience
and
dogma
quavered
off
into
silence
and
he
explained
to
the
baron
who
guardedly
said
perhaps
that
though
people
opinions
might
and
did
vary
seen
near
if
one
spread
them
out
wide
enough
pushed
them
back
far
enough
took
them
up
high
enough
bored
them
down
deep
enough
got
them
away
from
detail
and
loose
from
foregrounds
one
would
come
at
last
to
the
great
mother
opinion
of
them
all
in
whose
huge
lap
men
curled
themselves
up
contentedly
like
the
happy
identities
they
indeed
were
and
went
after
kissing
each
other
in
placidest
agreement
to
sleep
perhaps
said
the
baron
personalities
immediate
interests
duties
daily
life
were
swamped
in
the
vast
seas
in
which
with
politeness
but
determination
herr
dremmel
took
the
baron
swimming
one
only
needed
he
repeated
warm
with
the
wish
to
keep
in
roomy
regions
to
trace
back
any
two
opinions
however
bitterly
different
they
now
were
far
enough
to
get
at
last
to
the
point
where
they
sweetly
kissed
perhaps
said
the
baron
one
only
needed
went
on
herr
dremmel
making
movements
with
his
arms
but
the
baron
cleared
his
throat
and
began
to
enumerate
contrary
facts
herr
dremmel
agreed
at
once
that
he
was
right
just
there
and
pushed
the
point
of
kissing
back
a
little
further
the
baron
went
after
him
with
more
facts
herr
dremmel
again
agreed
and
went
back
further
in
this
way
they
came
at
last
to
the
garden
of
eden
beyond
which
the
baron
refused
to
budge
alleging
that
further
back
than
that
no
christian
could
go
and
even
in
that
he
repudiated
the
kiss
he
was
convinced
though
he
concealed
it
that
at
no
period
of
human
thought
could
his
and
herr
opinions
for
example
have
kissed
but
it
was
an
amiable
view
and
herr
dremmel
was
extremely
polite
and
was
bent
evidently
on
peace
and
the
baron
recognising
this
became
less
distrustful
he
even
contributed
a
thought
of
his
own
at
last
after
having
been
negatively
occupied
in
dissecting
herr
dremmel
and
said
that
in
his
opinion
it
was
details
that
made
life
difficult
the
baroness
who
loved
him
and
overheard
him
was
anxious
he
should
have
more
coffee
with
plenty
of
milk
in
it
after
this
men
she
explained
to
ingeborg
in
careful
english
as
she
poured
it
out
need
much
nourishment
because
of
all
this
i
suppose
they
do
said
ingeborg
when
i
was
first
married
i
remember
it
was
my
chief
pride
and
joy
that
at
last
i
had
some
one
of
my
very
own
to
nourish
oh
said
ingeborg
it
is
an
instinct
said
the
baroness
who
had
the
air
of
administering
a
lesson
in
a
true
woman
she
wishes
to
nourish
and
naturally
the
joy
of
nourishing
two
is
double
the
joy
of
nourishing
one
i
suppose
it
is
said
ingeborg
who
did
not
quite
follow
when
my
oh
yes
said
ingeborg
glad
to
understand
when
my
was
laid
in
my
arms
i
can
not
express
frau
pastor
what
happiness
i
had
in
being
given
yet
another
human
being
to
nourish
i
suppose
it
was
delightful
said
ingeborg
politely
sympathetic
the
baroness
eyes
drooped
a
moment
inquiringly
from
ingeborg
face
to
her
body
for
six
years
she
went
on
after
a
pause
i
had
fresh
reason
for
happiness
regularly
at
christmas
i
suppose
you
have
the
loveliest
christmases
here
said
ingeborg
like
the
ones
in
books
with
trees
trees
naturally
we
have
trees
but
i
had
babies
as
well
every
christmas
for
six
years
regularly
my
christmas
present
to
my
dear
husband
was
able
to
be
a
baby
what
said
ingeborg
opening
her
eyes
a
fresh
one
naturally
it
was
fresh
one
does
not
have
the
same
baby
twice
no
of
course
not
but
how
did
you
hide
it
till
christmas
day
it
could
not
naturally
said
the
baroness
stiffly
be
as
much
a
surprise
as
a
present
that
was
not
a
baby
would
have
been
but
it
was
for
all
practical
purposes
hidden
till
christmas
on
that
day
it
was
born
oh
but
i
think
that
was
very
wonderful
said
ingeborg
genuinely
pleased
by
such
neatness
she
leaned
forward
in
her
enthusiasm
and
clasped
her
hands
about
her
knees
yes
said
the
baroness
relaxing
a
little
before
this
flattering
appreciation
yes
it
was
some
people
would
call
it
chance
but
we
as
christians
knew
it
was
heaven
but
how
said
ingeborg
admiringly
how
yes
yes
mused
the
baroness
relaxing
still
more
in
the
warm
moisture
of
remembrance
they
were
happy
times
happy
happy
times
one
little
ones
coming
and
going
oh
did
they
go
as
well
as
come
asked
ingeborg
lowering
her
voice
to
condolence
about
one
knees
i
mean
and
the
house
oh
yes
said
ingeborg
relieved
every
year
the
christmas
candles
shining
down
on
an
addition
to
our
treasures
every
year
the
gifts
of
past
christmases
gathered
about
the
tree
again
bigger
and
stronger
instead
of
being
lost
or
broken
as
they
would
have
been
if
they
had
been
any
other
kind
of
gift
but
what
happened
when
there
were
any
more
to
give
then
i
gave
my
husband
oh
after
all
most
women
have
to
do
that
all
their
lives
i
did
not
grumble
when
heaven
ceased
to
provide
me
with
a
present
for
him
i
knew
how
to
bow
my
head
and
went
and
bought
one
there
are
excellent
at
wertheim
in
königsberg
if
you
wish
to
give
one
to
herr
pastor
next
christinas
they
do
not
come
unsewn
at
the
corners
by
july
or
august
in
the
way
those
one
buys
in
other
shops
do
ah
yes
happy
years
happy
happy
years
first
the
six
years
of
great
joy
collecting
my
family
and
then
the
years
of
happiness
bringing
it
up
of
course
you
are
fond
of
children
i
never
had
any
naturally
you
have
not
said
the
baroness
stiffening
again
so
i
do
know
said
ingeborg
but
every
true
woman
loves
little
children
said
the
baroness
but
they
must
be
said
ingeborg
one
has
instincts
said
the
baroness
but
one
must
something
to
practise
them
on
said
ingeborg
a
true
woman
is
all
love
said
the
baroness
in
a
voice
that
sounded
very
like
scolding
i
suppose
she
is
said
ingeborg
who
felt
that
she
never
could
have
met
one
she
had
a
vision
of
something
altogether
soft
and
squelchy
and
humid
and
at
the
same
time
wonderful
are
any
of
your
children
at
home
she
asked
thinking
she
would
like
to
test
her
instincts
on
the
younger
glambecks
they
are
grown
up
and
gone
out
into
the
world
some
far
away
in
other
countries
ah
yes
one
is
lonely
the
baroness
became
loftily
plaintive
it
is
the
lot
of
parents
lonely
lonely
i
had
five
daughters
it
was
a
great
relief
to
get
them
all
married
there
was
naturally
the
danger
where
there
were
so
many
of
some
of
them
staying
with
us
always
but
then
you
would
have
been
lonely
said
ingeborg
but
then
frau
pastor
they
would
not
have
been
married
no
and
then
said
ingeborg
interested
you
would
have
been
able
to
lonely
the
baroness
gazed
at
her
these
things
are
you
know
said
ingeborg
leaning
forward
again
in
her
interest
one
does
it
somehow
being
sad
you
know
and
thinking
how
lonely
one
is
of
course
it
much
more
delicious
to
be
happy
but
not
being
happy
has
its
jollinesses
there
a
perfume
she
sought
about
in
her
mind
it
like
a
wet
day
it
looks
gloomy
and
miserable
compared
to
what
yesterday
was
like
but
there
an
enjoyment
and
things
she
hesitated
groping
things
seem
to
grow
different
ones
yet
they
beautiful
too
but
the
baroness
who
did
not
follow
and
did
not
want
to
for
it
was
not
her
business
to
listen
to
her
pastor
wife
drooped
an
inquiring
eye
again
over
ingeborg
body
and
cut
her
tendency
to
talk
more
than
was
becoming
in
her
position
short
by
remarking
that
she
was
still
very
thin
when
they
had
sat
there
till
the
coffee
was
cold
ingeborg
in
a
pause
of
the
talk
got
up
to
go
the
three
others
stared
at
her
without
moving
even
her
own
robert
stared
uncomprehending
it
seemed
a
lame
thing
to
have
to
explain
that
she
was
now
going
home
but
that
was
what
she
did
at
last
murmur
down
to
the
motionless
and
surprised
baroness
are
you
not
feeling
well
inquired
the
baroness
what
is
it
ingeborg
asked
herr
dremmel
the
baron
went
over
to
a
window
and
opened
it
a
little
faint
no
doubt
he
said
adding
something
about
young
wives
the
baroness
asked
her
if
she
would
like
to
lie
down
herr
dremmel
became
alert
and
interested
what
is
it
little
one
he
asked
again
getting
up
i
think
it
would
be
good
if
the
frau
pastor
rested
a
little
before
supper
said
the
baroness
getting
up
too
certainly
said
herr
dremmel
quite
eagerly
and
with
a
funny
expression
on
his
face
ingeborg
gazed
from
one
to
the
other
but
robert
she
said
wondering
why
he
looked
like
that
ought
we
to
go
home
dear
frau
pastor
said
the
baroness
quite
warmly
you
will
feel
better
presently
believe
me
there
is
an
hour
still
before
supper
come
with
me
and
you
shall
lie
down
and
rest
but
robert
said
ingeborg
astonished
she
was
however
taken
away
it
seemed
a
sort
of
sweeping
of
her
away
through
glass
doors
down
a
carpetless
varnished
passage
into
a
spare
bedroom
and
commanded
to
put
herself
on
the
high
white
bed
with
her
head
a
little
lower
than
her
feet
but
she
said
why
you
will
be
better
by
oh
i
know
all
these
things
said
the
baroness
who
was
opening
windows
and
had
grown
suddenly
friendly
do
you
feel
sick
sick
she
wondered
whether
the
amount
of
cake
she
had
eaten
had
appeared
excessive
she
had
had
two
pieces
perhaps
there
was
a
rigid
local
custom
prescribing
only
one
she
felt
again
that
she
was
in
a
net
of
customs
with
nobody
to
explain
the
baroness
seemed
quite
disappointed
when
she
assured
her
she
did
not
feel
sick
at
all
ought
guests
to
feel
sick
was
it
a
subtle
way
of
drawing
attention
to
the
irresistibleness
of
the
host
food
it
then
occurred
to
her
that
it
might
very
possibly
be
the
custom
in
these
country
places
to
put
callers
to
bed
for
an
hour
in
the
middle
of
their
call
and
that
her
omission
to
put
her
there
was
one
of
the
causes
of
her
tears
next
to
going
home
as
quickly
as
one
did
in
england
she
felt
going
to
bed
was
altogether
the
best
thing
this
thought
that
it
must
be
the
custom
made
her
instantly
pliable
with
every
gesture
of
politeness
she
hastened
to
clamber
up
on
to
the
billows
of
feathers
and
white
quilt
there
was
a
smell
of
naphthalin
as
she
sank
downwards
a
smell
of
careful
warfare
carried
on
incessantly
with
moth
the
baroness
came
away
from
letting
in
floods
of
air
and
looked
at
her
i
am
sure
she
said
you
do
feel
sick
i
think
i
do
a
little
said
ingeborg
anxious
to
give
every
satisfaction
it
was
evidently
the
right
thing
to
say
for
her
hostess
face
lit
up
she
went
out
of
the
room
quickly
and
came
back
with
some
eau
de
cologne
and
a
fan
ingeborg
watched
her
with
bright
alert
eyes
over
the
edge
of
a
billow
of
feathers
while
she
fetched
a
little
table
and
brought
it
to
the
bed
and
arranged
these
things
on
it
how
odd
it
was
she
thought
greatly
interested
was
the
baron
simultaneously
putting
robert
to
bed
in
some
other
room
she
felt
she
had
grown
suddenly
popular
that
she
was
doing
all
the
right
things
at
last
contrasted
with
its
loftiness
during
the
first
part
of
the
call
the
baroness
manner
was
quite
human
and
warm
she
put
the
table
close
to
her
side
and
told
her
the
best
thing
she
could
do
quite
the
best
thing
would
be
to
try
and
sleep
a
little
if
she
wanted
anything
she
was
to
ring
and
the
maid
tina
would
appear
ah
yes
she
said
in
conclusion
standing
for
a
moment
looking
down
at
her
and
heaving
a
great
sigh
that
seemed
to
ingeborg
somehow
to
be
pleasurable
ah
yes
when
one
has
said
a
dear
frau
pastor
one
must
say
ah
yes
and
she
went
out
again
on
softly
closing
the
door
and
leaving
ingeborg
in
a
state
of
extreme
and
active
interest
and
interrogation
when
one
has
said
a
one
must
say
b
why
must
one
and
what
was
b
what
indeed
if
you
came
to
that
was
a
she
listened
a
moment
raised
on
her
elbow
her
bright
head
more
ruffled
than
ever
after
its
descent
into
the
billows
then
she
slid
down
on
to
the
slippery
floor
and
ran
across
in
her
stockings
to
one
of
the
big
open
windows
it
looked
on
to
a
tangle
of
garden
a
sort
of
wilderness
of
lilac
bushes
and
syringa
and
neglected
roses
and
rough
grass
and
hemlock
at
the
back
of
the
house
there
was
nobody
anywhere
to
be
seen
and
she
got
up
on
to
the
sill
and
sat
there
in
great
enjoyment
swinging
her
feet
for
it
all
smelt
very
sweet
at
the
end
of
the
long
hot
day
till
she
thought
the
hour
the
blessed
hour
must
be
nearly
over
then
she
stole
back
and
rearranged
herself
carefully
on
the
bed
but
this
is
way
of
paying
calls
she
thought
pulling
the
quilt
up
tidily
under
her
chin
and
waiting
for
what
would
be
done
to
her
next
chapter
xvi
they
did
not
get
away
till
nine
there
was
supper
at
seven
an
elaborate
meal
and
they
sat
over
it
an
hour
and
a
half
then
came
more
coffee
served
on
the
terrace
by
servants
in
white
cotton
gloves
and
half
an
hour
later
just
before
they
left
tea
and
sandwiches
and
cakes
and
fruit
and
beer
ingeborg
was
now
quite
clear
about
the
reason
for
her
tears
she
saw
very
vividly
how
dreadful
her
behaviour
must
have
seemed
that
groaning
that
piling
up
as
the
end
of
the
visit
drew
near
of
more
food
and
more
and
more
and
the
refreshment
of
bed
in
the
middle
i
shall
invite
her
all
over
again
she
said
suddenly
determined
to
make
amends
when
she
said
this
the
carriage
had
finally
detached
them
from
sight
and
sound
of
the
now
quite
cordial
glambecks
and
was
heaving
through
the
sand
of
the
dark
wooded
road
beyond
their
gate
whom
will
the
little
one
invite
asked
herr
dremmel
bending
down
he
had
got
his
arm
round
her
and
at
the
bigger
joltings
tightened
his
hold
and
lifted
her
a
little
his
voice
was
tender
and
when
he
bent
down
there
was
an
enveloping
smell
of
cigars
and
wine
mixed
with
the
of
his
mackintosh
ingeborg
knew
that
for
some
reason
she
could
not
discover
she
had
made
herself
popular
there
was
the
distinct
consciousness
of
having
suddenly
half
way
through
the
visit
become
a
success
and
she
was
still
going
on
being
a
success
she
felt
but
why
robert
was
extraordinarily
attentive
too
attentive
really
for
oh
what
a
wonderful
night
of
stars
and
warm
scents
it
was
once
they
were
in
the
open
what
a
night
what
a
marvel
of
a
night
and
when
he
bent
over
her
it
was
blotted
out
dear
robert
she
did
love
him
but
away
there
on
that
low
meadow
far
away
over
there
where
a
white
mist
lay
on
the
swampy
places
and
the
leaves
of
the
flags
that
grew
along
the
ditch
stood
up
like
silver
spears
in
the
moonlight
one
could
imagine
the
damp
cool
fragrance
rising
up
as
one
feet
stirred
the
grass
the
perfect
solitariness
and
the
perfect
silence
except
for
the
bittern
there
was
a
bittern
she
had
discovered
in
those
swamps
if
she
were
over
there
now
lying
quite
quiet
on
the
higher
ground
by
the
ditch
quite
quiet
and
alone
she
would
hear
him
presently
solemnly
booming
whom
will
the
little
one
invite
asked
herr
dremmel
bending
down
across
the
whole
of
the
milky
way
and
every
single
one
of
all
the
multitude
of
scents
the
night
was
softly
throwing
against
her
face
he
kissed
her
very
kindly
and
at
unusual
length
it
lasted
so
long
that
she
missed
the
smell
of
an
entire
clover
field
your
mother
said
ingeborg
when
she
again
emerged
heavens
and
earth
said
herr
dremmel
i
know
now
what
i
did
or
rather
did
do
i
know
now
why
she
kept
on
saying
oh
robert
she
must
have
been
she
must
have
thought
i
did
care
a
bit
and
i
did
so
want
her
to
be
happy
why
did
you
tell
me
tell
you
what
little
sheep
about
there
having
to
be
supper
and
about
her
having
to
go
to
bed
to
bed
did
the
baron
put
you
put
me
to
bed
herr
dremmel
bent
down
again
and
looked
a
little
anxiously
at
as
much
of
her
face
as
he
could
see
in
the
moonlight
it
seemed
normal
not
in
the
least
flushed
or
feverish
he
touched
her
cheek
with
his
finger
it
was
cool
little
one
he
said
what
is
this
talk
of
beds
only
that
it
would
save
rather
a
lot
of
awful
things
happening
if
you
would
just
give
me
an
beforehand
of
what
is
expected
it
take
a
minute
i
would
disturb
you
at
your
work
for
anything
but
at
some
odd
time
breakfast
for
instance
or
while
you
shaving
if
you
about
beds
and
things
like
that
one
could
guess
it
you
know
in
redchester
one
did
do
it
you
see
and
it
such
a
really
beautiful
arrangement
oh
she
suddenly
flung
her
arms
round
him
and
held
him
tight
i
glad
i
married
one
of
you
one
of
me
herr
dremmel
again
peered
anxiously
at
her
face
one
of
you
wonderful
people
you
magnificent
spacious
people
in
redchester
we
got
rid
of
difficulties
by
running
away
you
face
them
and
overcome
them
there
is
much
doubt
is
there
which
is
the
finer
he
transferred
his
cigar
to
the
hand
that
was
round
her
shoulder
and
spread
his
right
one
largely
over
her
forehead
it
was
quite
cool
who
went
on
ingeborg
enthusiastically
jerking
her
head
away
from
his
hand
would
have
a
custom
that
makes
calls
last
five
hours
without
rebelling
you
are
too
splendidly
disciplined
to
rebel
you
do
you
just
set
about
finding
some
way
of
making
the
calls
endurable
and
you
hit
on
the
way
i
loved
that
hour
in
bed
if
only
i
known
that
the
other
day
when
your
mother
came
the
relief
of
it
but
my
mother
began
herr
dremmel
in
a
puzzled
voice
then
he
added
with
a
touch
of
severity
your
remarks
my
treasure
are
not
in
your
usual
taste
you
forget
my
mother
is
a
widow
oh
do
widows
do
not
widows
what
go
to
bed
now
kindly
tell
me
he
said
with
an
impatience
he
concealed
beneath
calm
for
he
had
heard
that
a
husband
who
wishes
to
become
successfully
a
father
has
to
accommodate
himself
to
many
moods
what
it
is
you
are
really
talking
about
why
about
your
not
explaining
things
to
me
in
time
what
things
about
your
mother
having
to
go
to
bed
why
should
my
mother
have
to
go
to
bed
oh
robert
because
it
the
custom
it
is
not
why
do
you
suppose
it
is
the
custom
what
when
i
just
been
put
there
and
you
saw
me
go
ingeborg
oh
do
call
me
ingeborg
ingeborg
this
is
levity
i
am
prepared
for
much
accommodating
of
myself
to
whims
in
regard
to
food
and
kindred
matters
but
am
i
to
endure
levity
for
nine
months
she
stared
at
him
you
went
to
bed
because
you
were
ill
he
said
i
was
she
said
indignantly
did
he
too
think
she
did
not
know
how
to
control
herself
in
the
presence
of
cake
what
you
were
not
there
was
a
note
of
such
sharp
disappointment
in
his
voice
that
in
her
turn
she
peered
at
his
face
now
kindly
tell
me
robert
she
said
giving
his
sleeve
a
slight
pull
what
it
is
you
are
talking
about
you
did
not
feel
faint
you
feel
quite
well
you
do
not
feel
ill
after
all
again
the
note
of
astonished
disappointment
but
why
should
i
feel
ill
then
why
did
you
ask
to
be
taken
home
almost
before
we
had
arrived
for
the
first
time
she
heard
anger
in
his
voice
anger
and
a
great
aggrievedness
almost
before
we
arrived
we
been
there
hours
you
had
me
a
call
meant
supper
almighty
heaven
he
cried
am
i
to
dwell
on
every
detail
of
life
am
i
personally
to
conduct
you
over
each
of
the
inches
of
your
steps
do
you
regard
me
as
an
elementary
school
can
you
not
imagine
can
you
not
calculate
probabilities
can
you
not
construct
some
searchlight
of
inference
of
your
own
and
illuminate
with
it
the
outline
of
at
least
the
next
few
hours
she
gazed
at
him
a
moment
in
astonishment
she
said
if
her
father
had
asked
her
only
one
of
these
questions
in
that
sort
of
voice
she
would
have
been
without
an
answer
beaten
down
and
crushed
but
robert
had
not
had
the
steady
continuous
frightening
of
her
from
babyhood
he
could
not
hold
over
her
like
an
awful
rod
that
she
owed
her
very
existence
to
him
he
could
not
claim
perpetual
gratitude
for
this
remote
tremendous
gift
bestowed
on
her
in
the
days
of
her
unconsciousness
he
was
a
kindly
stranger
appointed
by
the
church
to
walk
hand
in
hand
with
her
along
the
path
of
life
he
had
admired
her
and
kissed
her
and
quite
often
during
their
engagement
had
abased
himself
at
her
feet
also
she
had
seen
him
at
moments
such
as
shaving
i
believe
she
said
after
another
astonished
pause
that
scolding
me
and
you
scolding
me
because
you
angry
with
me
and
you
angry
with
me
robert
is
it
possible
you
angry
with
me
because
i
ill
he
threw
away
his
cigar
and
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
began
to
whisper
voluminously
into
her
ear
what
she
kept
on
saying
what
you
tickling
me
what
i
but
she
did
in
the
end
hear
and
drew
herself
a
little
back
from
him
to
look
at
him
with
a
new
interest
it
seemed
the
oddest
thing
that
he
so
busy
so
nearly
always
somewhere
else
in
thought
so
deeply
and
frequently
absent
from
the
surface
of
life
so
entirely
occupied
by
his
work
that
often
he
could
hardly
remember
he
had
a
wife
should
want
to
have
yet
another
object
of
the
kind
added
unto
him
a
child
and
that
she
who
lived
altogether
on
the
surface
who
knew
as
it
were
the
very
taste
of
each
of
the
day
minutes
and
possessed
them
all
who
never
lost
consciousness
of
the
present
and
never
for
an
instant
let
go
of
her
awareness
of
the
visible
and
the
now
should
be
without
any
such
desire
but
she
said
we
so
happy
we
so
happy
as
we
are
it
is
nothing
compared
to
what
we
would
be
but
i
have
even
begun
to
get
used
to
happiness
yet
to
the
one
i
got
you
will
infinitely
prefer
the
one
that
is
yet
to
come
but
robert
do
rush
me
along
do
let
us
rush
past
what
we
got
let
us
love
all
this
thoroughly
he
looked
at
her
very
gravely
we
have
now
been
married
two
months
he
said
i
become
anxious
i
can
not
tell
you
how
glad
i
was
and
then
it
was
nothing
after
all
she
gazed
at
him
with
a
feeling
of
a
new
incumbency
he
had
said
the
last
words
in
a
voice
she
did
not
know
with
a
catch
in
it
robert
she
said
quickly
putting
out
her
hand
and
touching
his
with
a
little
soft
stroking
movement
she
wished
above
all
things
to
make
him
perfectly
happy
always
she
had
loved
making
people
happy
and
she
was
so
grateful
to
him
so
grateful
for
the
freedom
she
had
got
through
him
that
just
her
gratitude
even
if
she
had
not
loved
him
would
have
made
her
try
to
do
and
be
everything
he
wished
but
she
did
love
him
she
certainly
loved
him
and
here
was
something
he
seemed
to
want
beyond
everything
and
that
she
alone
could
provide
him
with
he
turned
his
head
away
and
as
he
did
this
did
she
see
something
actually
glistening
in
his
eyes
glistening
like
something
wet
in
an
instant
she
had
put
her
arms
round
him
of
course
i
do
of
course
i
want
one
she
said
rubbing
her
cheek
up
and
down
his
mackintosh
some
heaps
of
course
we
have
them
everybody
has
them
of
course
i
soon
begin
do
mind
my
not
having
been
ill
i
so
sorry
i
be
ill
dear
robert
i
did
know
i
had
to
be
ill
but
i
will
be
soon
i
sure
i
will
be
i
i
feel
quite
like
being
ill
now
he
patted
her
face
his
face
still
turned
away
good
little
wife
he
said
good
little
wife
she
felt
nearer
to
him
than
she
had
ever
felt
so
close
in
understanding
and
sympathy
she
had
seen
tears
a
man
tears
of
what
tremendous
depths
of
feeling
were
they
not
the
signal
the
sentence
strong
man
floated
up
from
somewhere
and
hung
about
her
mind
she
pressed
him
to
her
in
a
passion
of
desire
to
make
him
altogether
happy
to
protect
him
from
feeling
too
much
she
held
him
like
that
her
cheek
against
his
arm
rubbing
it
up
and
down
every
now
and
then
to
show
how
well
she
understood
till
they
got
home
when
he
lifted
her
down
from
the
carriage
at
their
door
she
slipped
her
hand
round
the
back
of
his
neck
and
kept
it
there
a
moment
with
the
tenderest
lingering
touch
dear
robert
she
whispered
her
lips
on
his
ear
while
he
lifted
her
down
and
implicit
in
the
words
was
the
the
yearning
oh
little
thing
little
man
thing
i
take
of
you
she
hung
about
the
parlour
and
the
passage
while
he
went
as
he
said
for
a
moment
into
his
laboratory
for
a
final
look
round
waiting
for
him
in
a
strangely
warmed
exalted
state
entirely
at
one
with
him
suddenly
very
intimate
sure
that
after
letting
her
see
things
so
sacred
as
tears
he
would
only
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
evening
with
her
being
comforted
and
reassured
held
close
to
her
heart
talking
sweetly
with
her
in
the
quiet
dark
garden
but
there
were
six
saucerfuls
of
differently
treated
last
year
rye
ready
on
the
laboratory
table
for
counting
and
weighing
herr
dremmel
beheld
them
and
forgot
the
world
he
began
to
count
and
weigh
he
continued
to
count
and
weigh
he
ended
by
counting
and
weighing
them
all
and
it
was
dawn
before
satisfied
and
consoled
for
his
lost
afternoon
it
occurred
to
him
that
perhaps
it
might
be
bedtime
chapter
xvii
the
winter
came
before
ingeborg
after
many
false
alarms
due
to
her
extreme
eagerness
to
give
robert
the
happiness
he
wanted
was
able
to
assure
him
with
certainty
that
he
would
presently
become
a
father
and
i
she
said
looking
at
him
with
a
kind
of
surprised
awe
now
that
it
had
really
come
upon
her
i
suppose
i
will
be
a
mother
herr
dremmel
remarked
with
dryness
that
he
supposed
in
that
case
she
would
and
refused
to
become
enthusiastic
until
there
was
more
certainty
he
had
been
disappointed
during
the
summer
so
often
her
zeal
to
meet
his
wishes
made
her
pounce
upon
the
slightest
little
feeling
of
not
being
well
and
run
triumphantly
to
his
laboratory
daring
its
locked
door
defying
its
sacredness
to
tell
him
the
great
news
she
would
stand
there
radiantly
saying
things
that
sounded
like
paraphrases
of
the
scripture
and
almost
the
first
german
she
really
learned
and
used
was
the
german
so
familiar
in
every
household
for
being
of
good
hope
for
being
in
blessed
circumstance
for
some
time
herr
dremmel
greeted
these
tidings
with
emotion
and
excitement
but
as
the
summer
went
on
he
had
become
so
incredulous
that
she
fainted
twice
in
december
before
he
was
convinced
then
indeed
for
nearly
a
whole
day
his
joy
was
touching
one
can
not
however
keep
up
such
joy
and
ingeborg
found
that
things
after
this
brief
upheaval
of
emotion
settled
back
again
into
how
they
were
before
except
that
she
felt
extraordinarily
and
persistently
well
she
had
had
the
most
wonderful
summer
she
had
got
that
anyhow
tucked
away
up
the
sleeve
of
her
memory
and
could
bring
it
out
and
look
at
it
when
the
days
were
wet
and
she
felt
cold
and
sick
the
summer
that
year
in
east
prussia
had
been
a
long
drought
a
long
bath
of
sunshine
and
ingeborg
lived
out
in
it
in
an
ecstasy
of
freedom
her
body
light
and
perfectly
balanced
did
wonders
of
exploration
in
the
mighty
forests
that
began
at
the
north
of
the
kökensee
lake
and
went
on
without
stopping
to
the
sea
she
would
get
robert
dinner
ready
for
him
early
and
then
put
some
bread
and
butter
and
a
cucumber
into
a
knapsack
with
her
german
grammar
and
paddle
the
punt
down
the
lake
tie
it
up
where
the
trees
began
and
start
nothing
seemed
to
tire
her
she
would
walk
for
miles
along
the
endless
forest
tracks
just
as
much
suited
to
her
environment
just
as
harmonious
and
as
much
a
creature
of
air
and
sunshine
as
the
white
butterflies
that
fluttered
among
the
enormous
pine
trunks
every
now
and
then
for
sheer
delight
in
these
things
she
would
throw
herself
down
on
the
springy
delicious
carpet
of
whortleberries
and
lie
still
watching
the
tops
of
the
delicately
swaying
backwards
and
forwards
far
away
over
her
head
against
the
serene
northern
sky
they
made
a
gentle
sighing
noise
in
the
wind
it
was
the
only
sound
except
the
occasional
cry
of
a
woodpecker
or
the
cry
immensely
distant
of
a
hawk
nobody
but
herself
seemed
to
use
the
forests
it
was
the
rarest
thing
that
she
met
a
woodman
or
children
picking
whortleberries
when
she
did
she
was
much
stared
at
the
forests
were
quite
out
of
the
beat
of
tourists
or
foreigners
and
the
indigenous
ladies
were
too
properly
occupied
by
indoor
duties
to
wander
even
if
they
liked
forests
away
from
their
home
anchorage
and
for
those
whose
business
sent
them
into
these
lonely
places
to
come
across
somebody
belonging
to
the
class
that
can
have
dinner
every
day
regularly
in
a
house
if
it
likes
and
to
the
sex
that
ought
to
be
there
cooking
it
was
an
amazement
the
young
lady
however
seemed
so
happy
that
they
all
smiled
at
her
when
she
looked
at
them
they
supposed
she
must
be
some
one
grown
white
in
a
town
and
come
to
stay
the
summer
weeks
with
one
of
the
crown
foresters
that
would
explain
her
detachment
from
duty
her
knapsack
and
the
colour
of
her
skin
anyhow
just
her
passing
made
their
dull
day
interesting
and
they
would
watch
her
glinting
in
and
out
of
the
trees
till
at
last
hardly
distinguishable
from
one
of
the
white
butterflies
the
distance
took
her
when
she
was
quite
hot
she
would
sit
down
in
a
carefully
chosen
spot
where
if
possible
a
deciduous
tree
a
maple
or
a
bird
cherry
splashed
its
vivid
green
exquisitely
against
the
peculiar
misty
bloom
of
pink
and
grey
that
hung
about
the
pine
trunks
a
tree
that
looked
quite
little
down
among
these
giants
hardly
as
if
it
reached
to
their
knees
and
yet
when
she
stood
under
it
it
was
almost
as
big
as
the
in
the
kökensee
garden
she
did
not
sit
in
its
shade
she
went
some
distance
away
where
she
could
look
at
it
quivering
in
the
light
and
leaning
her
back
against
a
she
would
eat
her
bread
and
cucumber
and
feel
utterly
filled
with
the
love
and
glory
of
god
impossible
to
reason
about
this
feeling
it
was
there
it
seemed
in
that
summer
to
go
with
her
she
went
and
whatever
she
did
she
walked
in
blessing
it
was
in
the
light
she
thought
looking
round
her
the
wonderful
light
the
soft
radiance
of
the
forest
it
was
in
the
air
warm
and
fresh
scented
and
pungent
it
was
in
the
feel
of
the
pine
needles
and
the
dry
crisp
last
year
cones
she
crushed
as
she
went
along
it
was
in
the
cushions
of
moss
so
green
and
cool
that
she
stopped
to
pat
them
or
in
the
hot
lichen
that
came
off
in
flakes
when
her
feet
brushed
a
root
it
was
in
being
young
and
healthy
and
having
had
dinner
and
sitting
quiet
and
getting
rested
and
knowing
the
hours
ahead
were
roomy
it
was
in
all
these
things
everywhere
and
in
everything
she
would
pick
up
her
german
grammar
in
a
quick
desire
to
do
something
in
return
something
that
gave
her
real
trouble
shall
one
not
say
somehow
thank
you
and
she
engulfed
huge
tracts
of
it
on
these
expeditions
learning
pages
of
it
by
heart
and
repeating
them
aloud
to
the
and
the
woodpeckers
when
the
sun
began
to
go
down
she
set
out
for
home
sometimes
losing
her
way
for
quite
a
long
while
and
then
she
would
hurry
because
of
supper
and
then
she
would
get
very
hot
and
the
combined
heat
and
hurry
and
cucumber
to
which
presently
was
added
fatigue
would
end
in
one
of
those
triumphal
appearances
later
on
in
his
laboratory
to
which
he
was
growing
so
much
accustomed
in
january
when
she
was
just
a
sick
thing
she
thought
of
these
days
as
something
too
beautiful
to
have
really
happened
there
was
from
the
first
no
shyness
about
her
on
the
subject
of
babies
she
had
not
considered
it
during
her
life
at
home
for
babies
were
never
mentioned
at
the
palace
of
course
she
thought
remembering
this
omission
because
there
were
none
and
it
would
be
as
meaningless
to
talk
about
babies
when
there
were
none
as
it
would
be
in
kökensee
to
talk
about
bishops
when
there
were
none
she
arrived
therefore
at
kökensee
with
her
mind
a
blank
from
prejudice
and
finding
the
atmosphere
thick
with
babies
immediately
with
her
usual
uninquiring
pliability
adopted
the
prevailing
attitude
and
was
not
shy
either
the
neighbourhood
did
not
wait
till
they
were
born
to
talk
about
its
own
children
it
did
not
think
of
its
children
as
unmentionable
until
they
had
been
baptised
into
decency
by
birth
they
were
important
things
the
most
important
of
all
in
the
life
of
the
women
and
it
was
natural
to
discuss
them
thoroughly
the
childless
woman
was
a
pitied
creature
the
woman
who
had
most
children
was
proudest
she
might
be
poor
and
tormented
by
them
but
it
was
something
she
possessed
more
of
than
her
neighbours
ilse
had
early
inquired
which
room
would
be
the
nursery
that
obvious
pattern
of
respectability
baroness
glambeck
talked
of
births
with
a
detail
and
interest
only
second
to
that
with
which
she
talked
of
deaths
it
seemed
to
her
a
most
proper
topic
of
conversation
with
any
young
married
woman
and
on
her
returning
the
dremmel
call
a
fortnight
after
it
had
been
made
she
was
quite
taken
aback
and
annoyed
to
find
it
had
become
irrelevant
owing
to
ingeborg
being
perfectly
well
indeed
this
failure
of
ingeborg
entirely
spoilt
the
visit
the
baroness
who
had
arrived
friendly
withdrew
into
frost
with
the
manner
of
one
who
felt
she
had
been
thawed
on
the
last
occasion
on
false
pretences
impossible
to
meet
one
pastor
wife
and
such
an
and
one
too
with
any
familiarity
except
on
the
christian
footing
of
impending
birth
or
death
a
pastor
wife
belonged
to
the
class
one
is
only
really
pleasant
with
in
suffering
or
guilt
offended
yet
forced
to
continue
the
call
the
baroness
confined
such
conversation
as
she
made
to
questions
that
had
a
flavour
of
hostility
where
was
it
possible
to
get
such
shoes
and
did
the
frau
pastor
think
toes
so
narrow
good
for
the
circulation
and
the
housework
ingeborg
could
not
believe
this
was
the
motherly
lady
who
had
fussed
round
her
bed
that
day
at
glambeck
she
felt
set
away
at
a
great
distance
from
her
on
the
other
side
of
a
gulf
for
the
first
time
it
was
borne
in
upon
her
that
her
marriage
made
a
difference
to
her
socially
that
here
in
germany
the
gulf
was
a
wide
one
she
was
a
pastor
wife
and
when
asked
about
her
family
which
happened
early
and
searchingly
in
the
call
could
only
give
an
impression
of
more
pastors
ah
that
is
the
same
as
what
we
call
superintendent
said
the
baroness
nodding
several
times
slowly
on
learning
that
father
was
a
bishop
and
after
a
series
of
questions
as
to
the
frau
pastor
sister
marriage
nodded
her
head
slowly
several
times
again
and
informed
ingeborg
that
what
her
sister
had
married
was
a
schoolmaster
like
herr
schultz
said
the
baroness
herr
schultz
being
the
village
schoolmaster
there
was
a
photograph
of
judith
on
the
table
that
caught
and
kept
the
baroness
eye
and
also
in
an
even
greater
but
more
careful
degree
the
baron
it
was
judith
dressed
in
evening
beauty
perfect
ingeborg
took
it
up
with
a
natural
pride
in
having
such
a
lovely
thing
for
her
very
own
sister
and
handed
it
to
the
baroness
here
she
is
said
ingeborg
full
of
natural
pride
the
baroness
stared
in
real
consternation
what
she
said
this
is
a
schoolmaster
wife
this
is
our
i
had
thought
she
broke
off
and
with
a
firm
gesture
put
the
photograph
on
the
table
again
and
said
she
could
not
stay
to
supper
since
then
there
had
been
no
intercourse
with
glambeck
and
the
baroness
did
not
know
of
the
satisfactory
turn
things
had
taken
at
the
parsonage
till
on
christmas
eve
from
her
gallery
in
church
to
which
she
and
the
baron
had
decided
to
return
on
the
greater
festivals
as
a
mark
of
their
awareness
that
herr
dremmel
desired
to
make
amends
she
beheld
during
the
verses
of
the
chorale
ingeborg
drop
sideways
on
the
seat
in
her
pew
below
and
remain
motionless
and
bunched
up
her
pushed
crooked
on
the
desk
in
front
of
her
and
her
attitude
one
of
complete
indifference
to
appearances
the
baroness
did
not
nudge
the
baron
because
in
her
position
one
does
not
nudge
but
her
instinct
was
all
for
nudging
herr
dremmel
could
not
see
what
had
happened
custom
concealing
him
during
the
singing
in
a
wooden
box
at
the
foot
of
the
pulpit
where
he
was
busy
imagining
agricultural
experiments
till
he
came
out
the
singing
went
on
and
suppose
thought
the
baroness
he
were
to
forget
to
come
out
once
he
had
forgotten
she
had
heard
and
had
stayed
in
his
box
having
very
unfortunately
been
visited
there
by
a
revelation
concerning
potash
that
caught
him
up
into
oblivion
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
during
which
the
chorale
was
gone
through
with
an
increasing
faintness
fifteen
times
she
knew
about
the
hour
but
did
not
know
it
was
potash
suppose
he
once
again
fell
into
a
meditation
there
was
no
verger
beadle
or
official
person
of
any
sort
to
take
action
the
congregation
would
do
nothing
that
was
outside
the
customary
and
the
prescribed
there
was
no
female
relative
such
as
the
frau
pastor
would
have
had
staying
with
her
over
christmas
if
she
had
been
what
she
ought
to
have
been
and
what
every
other
pastor
wife
so
felicitously
was
a
german
and
for
her
herself
to
descend
and
help
in
the
eyes
of
all
kökensee
would
have
been
too
great
a
condescension
besides
involving
her
in
difficulties
with
the
wife
of
the
forester
and
the
wife
of
the
glambeck
schoolmaster
who
was
also
the
postman
both
of
whom
were
of
the
same
social
standing
as
the
younger
frau
dremmel
and
would
jealously
resent
the
least
mark
of
what
they
would
interpret
as
special
favour
herr
dremmel
however
came
out
punctually
and
went
up
into
the
pulpit
and
opened
his
manuscript
and
read
out
the
text
and
the
congregation
sat
as
nearly
thrilled
as
it
could
be
waiting
for
the
moment
when
his
eye
would
fall
on
to
his
own
pew
and
what
was
in
it
would
he
interrupt
the
service
to
go
down
and
carry
his
wife
out
would
the
congregation
have
to
wait
till
he
came
back
again
or
would
it
be
allowed
to
disperse
to
its
christmas
trees
and
rejoicings
herr
dremmel
read
on
and
on
expounding
the
innocent
christmas
story
describing
its
white
accessories
of
flocks
and
angels
and
virgins
and
stars
with
the
thunderous
vehemence
near
scolding
that
had
become
a
habit
with
him
when
he
preached
his
text
was
on
earth
goodwill
among
and
from
custom
he
hit
his
desk
with
his
clenched
fist
while
he
read
it
out
and
hurled
it
at
his
congregation
as
if
it
were
a
threat
he
did
not
look
in
his
wife
direction
he
was
not
thinking
of
her
at
all
he
wondered
a
little
at
the
stillness
and
attention
of
his
listeners
nobody
coughed
nobody
shuffled
the
school
children
hung
over
the
edge
of
the
organ
loft
motionless
and
intent
baron
glambeck
remained
awake
at
the
end
of
the
service
herr
dremmel
had
to
stay
according
to
custom
in
his
wooden
box
till
every
one
had
gone
and
it
was
not
till
he
came
out
of
that
to
go
through
the
church
to
its
only
door
that
he
perceived
ingeborg
for
a
moment
he
thought
she
was
waiting
for
him
in
an
attitude
of
inappropriately
childish
laxity
and
he
was
about
to
rebuke
her
when
it
flashed
upon
him
that
she
had
fainted
that
it
was
the
second
time
in
ten
days
and
that
he
was
indeed
and
without
any
doubt
at
last
the
happiest
of
men
in
spite
of
the
bitter
wind
that
was
raking
the
churchyard
every
person
who
had
been
inside
the
church
was
waiting
outside
to
see
the
pastor
come
out
the
glambecks
and
elders
of
the
church
would
have
waited
in
any
case
on
christmas
eve
to
wish
him
the
compliments
of
the
season
and
receive
his
in
return
but
on
this
occasion
they
waited
with
pleasure
as
well
as
patience
and
the
rest
of
the
congregation
waited
too
they
were
rewarded
by
seeing
him
presently
appear
in
the
doorway
in
his
gown
and
bands
carrying
the
bundle
that
was
the
still
unconscious
frau
pastor
as
if
she
were
a
baby
his
face
illuminated
with
joy
and
pride
it
was
as
entertaining
as
a
funeral
double
congratulations
were
poured
upon
him
double
and
treble
handshakes
of
the
hand
he
protruded
for
the
purpose
from
beneath
ingeborg
relaxed
body
and
his
spectacles
as
he
responded
were
misty
to
the
immense
gratification
of
the
crowd
with
happy
tears
this
was
the
first
popular
thing
ingeborg
had
done
since
her
arrival
she
could
not
if
she
had
planned
it
out
with
all
her
care
and
wits
have
achieved
anything
more
dramatically
ingratiating
the
day
was
the
most
appropriate
day
in
the
whole
year
it
had
been
well
worth
waiting
thought
her
overjoyed
robert
in
order
to
receive
such
a
christmas
gift
the
baroness
who
with
the
baron
was
most
cordial
felt
flattered
as
if
only
of
course
less
perfectly
for
she
herself
had
produced
her
children
in
actual
time
for
the
tree
her
example
had
been
taken
to
heart
and
followed
the
village
was
deeply
gratified
to
see
an
unconscious
frau
pastor
carried
through
its
midst
and
her
limp
body
had
all
the
prestige
of
a
corpse
everybody
was
moved
and
pleased
and
when
ingeborg
after
much
persuasion
woke
up
to
the
world
again
on
the
sofa
of
the
parsonage
parlour
it
was
to
live
through
the
happiest
day
she
had
yet
had
in
her
life
the
day
of
robert
greatest
joy
in
her
and
devotion
and
care
and
pride
and
petting
once
more
and
for
this
day
she
outstripped
the
fertilizers
in
interest
and
the
laboratory
was
a
place
forgotten
she
was
pampered
she
lay
on
the
sofa
feeling
quite
well
again
but
staying
obediently
on
it
because
he
told
her
to
and
she
loved
him
to
care
watching
him
with
happy
eyes
as
he
tremendously
hovered
he
finished
the
arranging
of
the
tree
for
her
and
fixed
the
candles
on
it
interrupting
himself
every
now
and
then
to
come
and
kiss
her
hands
and
pat
her
beams
seemed
to
proceed
from
him
and
penetrate
into
the
remotest
corners
in
a
land
where
all
homes
were
glowing
that
christmas
night
this
little
home
glowed
the
brightest
the
candles
of
the
tree
shone
down
on
ingeborg
curled
up
in
the
sofa
corner
talking
and
laughing
gaily
but
with
an
infinitely
proud
and
solemn
gladness
in
her
heart
that
at
last
he
believed
that
at
last
she
was
fairly
started
on
the
road
of
the
higher
duty
that
at
last
she
was
going
to
be
able
to
do
something
back
something
in
return
for
all
this
happiness
that
had
come
to
her
through
and
because
of
him
ilse
was
called
in
and
came
very
rosy
and
shining
from
careful
washing
to
be
given
her
presents
there
were
surprises
for
ingeborg
she
had
to
shut
her
eyes
while
they
were
arranged
that
touched
and
astonished
her
so
totally
blind
had
robert
seemed
to
be
for
weeks
past
to
anything
outside
his
work
a
pot
of
hyacinths
twisted
about
with
pink
crinkly
paper
and
satin
bows
that
he
must
have
got
with
immense
difficulty
and
elaborate
precautions
to
prevent
her
seeing
it
a
volume
of
poetry
a
pair
of
fur
gloves
a
silver
curb
bracelet
and
a
smiling
pig
of
marzipan
with
a
label
round
its
neck
bringe
she
not
realising
what
a
german
christmas
meant
had
only
a
for
him
and
when
her
lap
full
of
his
presents
and
her
wrist
decorated
with
the
bracelet
in
which
he
showed
an
honest
pride
carefully
explaining
the
trick
of
its
fastening
and
assuring
her
it
was
real
silver
and
that
little
women
he
well
knew
liked
being
hung
with
these
barbaric
splendours
she
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
apologised
for
her
dreadful
ignorance
of
custom
and
want
of
imagination
and
solitary
unsurprising
miserable
when
she
did
this
with
her
cheek
laid
on
his
furry
head
he
drew
her
very
close
to
him
and
blessed
her
blessed
her
his
little
wife
and
that
greatest
of
gifts
that
she
was
bringing
him
both
of
them
had
wet
eyes
when
this
blessing
solemnly
administered
and
received
was
over
it
was
done
in
the
presence
of
ilse
who
looked
on
benevolently
and
at
the
end
came
and
shook
their
hands
and
joined
to
her
thanks
for
what
she
had
been
given
her
congratulations
on
the
happy
event
of
the
coming
summer
july
said
ilse
after
a
moment
reflection
we
must
furnish
that
room
she
added
ingeborg
felt
as
though
her
very
bones
were
soft
with
love
chapter
xviii
but
these
high
moments
of
swimming
in
warm
emotion
do
not
last
she
found
they
are
not
final
they
are
not
as
she
had
fondly
believed
a
state
of
understanding
and
cloudless
love
at
last
attained
to
and
rested
in
radiantly
she
discovered
that
the
littlest
thing
puts
an
end
to
them
just
such
a
little
thing
as
its
being
bedtime
for
instance
is
enough
and
the
mood
does
not
return
and
not
only
does
it
not
return
but
it
seems
forgotten
she
became
aware
of
this
next
morning
at
breakfast
and
it
caused
at
first
an
immense
surprise
she
had
got
the
coffee
ready
with
the
glow
of
the
evening
before
still
warming
her
rosily
she
was
still
altogether
thinking
robert
and
wondering
her
head
on
one
side
as
she
cut
the
bread
ilse
was
a
little
cross
after
the
marzipan
and
a
smile
on
her
lips
at
the
happiness
the
world
contains
and
when
he
came
in
she
ran
to
him
shiningly
ready
to
take
up
the
mood
at
the
exact
point
where
bedtime
had
broken
it
off
the
night
before
but
herr
dremmel
had
travelled
a
thousand
miles
in
thought
since
then
he
hardly
saw
her
he
kissed
her
mechanically
and
sat
down
to
eat
to
him
she
was
as
everyday
and
usual
again
as
the
bread
and
coffee
of
his
breakfast
she
was
his
wife
who
was
going
presently
to
be
a
mother
it
was
normal
ordinary
and
satisfactory
and
the
matter
being
settled
and
the
proper
first
joy
and
sentiment
felt
he
could
go
on
with
more
concentration
than
ever
with
his
work
for
there
would
not
now
be
the
perturbing
moments
so
frequent
in
the
last
six
months
when
his
condition
or
rather
negation
of
condition
had
thrust
itself
with
the
annoyance
of
an
irrepressible
weed
up
among
his
thinking
the
matter
was
settled
and
he
put
it
aside
as
every
worker
must
put
the
extraneous
aside
just
on
this
morning
he
was
profoundly
concerned
with
the
function
of
potash
in
the
formation
of
carbohydrates
he
had
sat
up
late
long
after
ingeborg
feeling
as
if
she
were
dissolved
in
stars
and
happily
certain
that
robert
felt
just
as
liquidly
starry
had
gone
to
bed
considering
potash
he
wanted
more
starch
in
his
grain
more
in
his
straw
she
was
not
across
the
passage
into
their
bedroom
before
his
mind
had
sprung
back
to
potash
more
starch
in
his
grain
more
in
his
straw
less
fungoid
disease
on
his
mangels
at
breakfast
his
thoughts
were
so
sticky
with
the
glucose
and
cane
sugar
of
digestible
carbohydrates
that
he
could
not
even
get
them
free
for
his
newspaper
but
sat
quite
silently
munching
bread
and
butter
his
eyes
on
his
plate
well
robert
said
ingeborg
smiling
at
him
round
the
coffee
pot
a
smile
in
which
lurked
the
joyful
importance
of
the
evening
before
well
little
one
he
said
absently
not
looking
at
her
well
robert
she
said
again
challengingly
what
is
it
little
one
he
asked
looking
up
with
the
slight
irritation
of
the
interrupted
what
you
not
pleased
any
more
she
asked
pretending
indignation
pleased
about
what
she
stared
at
him
at
this
without
pretending
anything
about
what
she
repeated
her
lips
dropping
apart
he
had
forgotten
she
thought
this
really
very
extraordinary
she
poured
herself
out
a
cup
of
coffee
slowly
thinking
he
had
forgotten
the
thing
he
had
said
so
often
that
he
wanted
most
was
a
thing
he
could
forget
once
he
had
the
certain
promise
of
it
in
a
night
the
candles
on
the
christmas
tree
in
the
corner
were
not
more
burned
out
and
finished
than
his
tender
intensity
of
feeling
of
the
evening
before
well
that
was
robert
that
was
the
way
of
course
of
clever
men
but
the
tears
he
had
felt
enough
for
tears
it
was
without
a
doubt
that
he
had
felt
tremendously
how
wonderful
then
she
thought
slowly
dropping
sugar
into
her
cup
for
even
the
memory
of
it
to
be
wiped
out
well
that
too
was
robert
he
did
not
cling
as
she
did
to
moments
but
passed
on
intelligently
and
she
was
merely
stupid
to
suppose
any
one
with
his
brains
would
linger
would
loiter
about
with
her
indefinitely
gloating
over
their
happiness
she
left
her
coffee
and
got
up
and
went
over
to
him
and
kissed
him
dear
robert
she
murmured
accommodating
herself
to
him
proud
even
now
that
he
could
be
so
deeply
preoccupied
with
profound
thoughts
as
to
forget
an
event
so
really
great
for
after
all
a
child
to
be
born
a
new
life
to
be
launched
was
not
that
something
really
great
yet
his
thoughts
her
husband
thoughts
were
greater
dear
robert
she
murmured
and
kissed
him
proudly
but
the
winter
in
spite
of
these
convictions
of
happiness
and
of
having
every
reason
for
pride
was
a
time
that
she
dragged
through
with
difficulty
she
who
had
never
thought
of
her
body
who
had
found
in
it
the
perfect
instrument
for
carrying
out
her
will
was
forced
to
think
of
it
almost
continuously
it
mastered
her
she
had
endlessly
to
humour
it
before
she
could
use
it
even
a
little
she
seemed
for
ever
to
be
having
to
take
it
to
a
sofa
and
lay
it
down
flat
and
not
make
it
do
anything
she
seemed
for
ever
to
be
trying
to
persuade
it
that
it
did
not
mind
the
smell
of
the
pig
or
the
smell
that
came
across
from
glambeck
when
the
wind
was
that
way
of
potato
spirits
being
made
in
the
distillery
there
when
these
smells
got
through
the
window
chinks
she
would
shut
her
eyes
and
think
hard
of
the
scent
of
roses
and
pinks
and
of
that
lovely
orange
scent
of
the
lupin
she
had
seen
grown
everywhere
in
the
summer
but
sooner
or
later
her
efforts
however
valiant
ended
in
the
creeping
coldness
the
icy
perspiration
of
sick
faintness
as
the
months
went
on
her
body
became
fastidious
even
about
daily
inevitable
smells
such
as
the
roasting
of
coffee
and
the
frying
of
potatoes
which
was
extremely
awkward
when
one
had
to
see
to
these
things
oneself
and
it
often
happened
that
ilse
coming
out
of
the
scullery
or
in
from
the
yard
fresh
and
energetic
with
health
would
find
her
mistress
dropped
on
a
chair
with
her
head
on
the
kitchen
table
in
quite
an
absurd
condition
considering
that
everybody
assured
her
it
was
not
an
illness
at
all
of
feeling
as
though
it
were
one
ilse
would
look
at
her
with
a
kind
of
amused
sympathy
the
frau
pastor
will
be
worse
before
she
is
better
she
would
say
cheerfully
and
if
things
were
very
bad
and
ingeborg
white
and
damp
clung
to
her
in
a
silent
struggle
to
feel
not
white
and
damp
she
used
the
formula
first
heard
on
the
lips
of
baroness
glambeck
and
nodded
encouragingly
though
not
without
a
certain
air
of
something
that
was
a
little
like
pleasure
and
said
those
who
have
said
a
must
also
say
b
when
ingeborg
spirit
was
at
its
lowest
in
these
unequal
combats
she
would
droop
her
head
and
shut
her
eyes
and
feel
she
hated
oh
she
faintly
coldly
sicklily
hated
b
the
fun
of
housekeeping
of
doing
everything
yourself
wore
extremely
thin
during
the
next
few
months
she
no
longer
jumped
out
of
bed
eager
to
get
to
her
duties
again
and
bless
the
beginning
of
each
new
day
by
a
charming
and
cheerful
breakfast
table
for
her
man
she
felt
heavy
reluctant
to
face
the
business
of
dressing
sure
that
no
sooner
would
she
be
on
her
feet
than
she
would
feel
ill
again
she
talked
of
getting
another
servant
a
cook
and
herr
dremmel
who
left
these
arrangements
entirely
to
her
agreed
at
once
but
when
it
came
to
taking
the
necessary
steps
to
advertising
or
journeying
in
to
königsberg
to
an
agency
she
flagged
and
did
nothing
it
was
all
so
difficult
she
might
faint
on
the
way
she
might
be
sick
and
she
could
not
ask
robert
to
help
her
because
she
did
not
know
what
problem
nearing
a
triumphant
solution
she
might
not
disastrously
interrupt
it
seemed
to
her
monstrous
to
take
a
man
off
his
thinking
to
tear
its
threads
perhaps
to
spoil
for
good
that
particular
line
of
thought
with
demands
that
he
should
write
advertisements
for
a
cook
or
go
with
her
in
search
of
one
and
as
no
cook
was
to
be
found
locally
every
wife
and
mother
except
ladies
like
baroness
glambeck
carrying
out
these
higher
domestic
rites
herself
she
did
nothing
she
resigned
herself
to
a
fate
that
was
after
all
everybody
else
in
kökensee
it
was
easier
to
be
resigned
than
to
be
energetic
her
will
grew
very
flabby
once
she
said
prayers
about
cooking
and
asked
that
she
might
never
see
or
smell
it
again
but
she
broke
off
on
realising
suddenly
and
chillily
that
only
death
could
get
her
out
of
the
kitchen
herr
dremmel
was
as
he
had
always
been
good
and
kind
to
her
he
saw
nothing
as
indeed
there
was
nothing
but
the
normal
and
the
satisfactory
in
anything
she
felt
yet
he
did
what
he
could
whenever
he
remembered
to
to
cheer
and
encourage
when
coming
out
of
his
laboratory
to
meals
he
found
her
not
at
the
table
but
on
the
sofa
her
face
turned
to
the
wall
and
buried
in
an
orange
so
that
the
dinner
smell
might
be
in
some
small
measure
dissembled
and
cloaked
he
often
patted
her
before
beginning
to
eat
and
said
poor
little
woman
one
can
not
however
go
on
saying
poor
little
woman
continuously
and
of
necessity
there
were
gaps
in
these
sympathies
but
at
least
twice
he
put
off
his
return
to
work
for
a
few
minutes
in
order
to
hearten
her
by
painting
the
great
happiness
that
was
in
store
for
her
at
the
end
of
these
tiresome
months
the
marvellous
moment
not
equalled
he
was
informed
by
any
other
moment
in
a
human
being
life
when
the
young
mother
first
beheld
her
offspring
i
see
my
little
wife
so
proud
so
happy
he
would
say
and
each
time
the
picture
dimmed
his
eyes
and
brought
him
over
to
her
to
stroke
her
hair
then
she
would
forget
how
sick
she
felt
and
smile
and
be
ashamed
that
she
had
minded
anything
the
highest
good
what
would
not
one
practise
in
the
way
of
being
sick
to
attain
the
highest
good
and
he
be
full
of
brains
like
yours
she
would
say
pulling
down
his
hand
from
her
hair
and
kissing
it
and
looking
up
at
him
smiling
and
i
shall
have
to
double
the
size
of
my
heart
herr
dremmel
would
say
to
take
in
two
loves
then
ingeborg
would
laugh
for
joy
and
for
quite
a
long
while
manage
very
nearly
to
glory
in
feeling
sick
about
march
when
the
snow
that
had
been
heaped
on
either
side
of
the
path
to
the
gate
all
the
winter
began
to
dwindle
dirtily
and
at
midday
the
eaves
dripped
melting
icicles
and
the
sun
had
warmth
in
it
and
great
winds
set
the
world
creaking
things
got
better
she
no
longer
felt
the
grip
of
faintness
on
her
heart
she
left
off
looking
quite
so
plain
and
an
increasing
dignity
attended
her
steps
which
every
week
were
slower
and
heavier
after
months
of
not
being
able
to
look
at
food
she
grew
surprisingly
hungry
she
became
suddenly
voracious
and
ate
and
ate
ilse
amused
interest
continued
her
mother
had
had
fourteen
children
and
was
still
regularly
having
more
and
ilse
was
well
acquainted
with
the
stages
the
frau
pastor
it
is
true
took
the
stages
more
seriously
with
more
difficulty
with
a
greater
stress
on
them
than
ilse
mother
or
other
kökensee
women
but
roughly
it
was
always
the
same
story
it
will
be
easier
next
time
prophesied
ilse
inspiritingly
though
the
thought
of
a
next
time
before
she
had
finished
this
one
depressed
rather
than
inspirited
ingeborg
she
had
written
home
to
redchester
to
tell
her
great
news
and
received
a
letter
from
bullivant
in
return
in
which
there
was
an
extremity
of
absence
of
enthusiasm
indeed
the
coming
baby
was
only
alluded
to
sideways
as
it
were
indirectly
and
if
written
words
could
whisper
in
a
whisper
father
is
the
letter
went
on
getting
away
as
quickly
as
possible
from
matters
of
such
doubtful
decency
as
an
unborn
german
has
too
much
to
do
delicate
as
i
am
i
would
gladly
help
him
with
his
correspondence
if
i
could
but
i
fear
the
strain
would
be
too
much
he
sadly
needs
a
complete
rest
and
change
alas
shorthanded
as
he
is
and
obliged
now
as
we
are
to
retrench
there
is
no
prospect
of
whereupon
ingeborg
impulsively
wrote
suggesting
in
loving
and
enthusiastic
terms
a
visit
to
kökensee
as
the
most
complete
change
she
could
think
of
and
also
as
the
most
economical
the
answer
to
this
when
it
did
come
was
an
extraordinarily
dignified
no
in
april
baroness
glambeck
drove
over
one
fine
afternoon
and
questioned
her
as
to
her
preparations
and
was
astonished
to
find
there
were
none
but
my
dear
frau
pastor
she
cried
holding
up
both
her
yellow
kid
hands
what
ought
there
to
be
asked
ingeborg
who
had
been
too
busy
wrestling
with
her
daily
tasks
in
her
heavily
handicapped
state
to
think
of
further
labours
many
things
necessary
indispensable
things
what
things
asked
ingeborg
faintly
she
had
little
spirit
she
was
more
tired
every
day
just
the
difficulty
of
keeping
even
with
her
housekeeping
of
keeping
herself
tidy
in
dresses
that
seemed
to
shrink
smaller
each
time
she
put
them
on
took
up
what
strength
she
had
there
was
none
left
over
what
things
she
asked
and
her
hands
lying
listlessly
on
her
lap
were
flaccid
and
damp
then
the
baroness
poured
forth
an
endless
and
bewildering
list
with
all
the
gusto
and
interest
of
health
and
leisure
when
her
english
gave
out
she
went
on
in
german
her
list
ended
with
a
midwife
have
you
spoken
with
her
she
asked
no
said
ingeborg
i
did
know
where
is
she
in
our
village
frau
dosch
it
is
lucky
for
you
she
is
not
further
away
sometimes
there
is
none
for
miles
she
is
a
very
good
sort
of
person
a
little
old
now
but
at
least
she
been
very
good
you
ought
to
see
her
at
once
and
arrange
oh
said
ingeborg
who
felt
as
if
the
one
blessedness
in
life
would
be
to
creep
away
somewhere
and
never
arrange
anything
about
anything
for
ever
but
it
did
after
this
become
clear
to
her
that
certain
preparations
would
undoubtedly
have
to
be
made
and
she
braced
herself
to
driving
into
meuk
with
ilse
and
going
by
train
to
königsberg
for
a
shopping
with
sandwiches
in
her
pocket
and
doubt
in
her
heart
she
went
off
to
shop
for
the
first
time
in
german
ilse
full
of
importance
and
dressed
astonishingly
in
stockings
and
new
spring
garments
sat
by
her
side
with
an
eye
to
right
and
left
in
search
of
some
one
to
witness
her
splendour
herr
dremmel
had
laid
many
and
strict
injunctions
on
her
to
take
care
of
her
mistress
and
in
between
these
wandering
glances
she
did
her
best
by
loud
inquiries
as
to
frau
pastor
sensations
frau
pastor
sensations
were
those
of
a
perilously
jolted
woman
she
held
tight
to
the
hand
rail
on
one
side
while
the
meuk
cobbles
lasted
and
to
ilse
arm
on
the
other
and
was
thankful
when
the
station
was
reached
and
she
somehow
with
a
shameful
clumsiness
got
down
out
of
the
high
carriage
incredible
to
remember
that
last
time
she
had
been
at
that
station
she
had
jumped
up
into
the
same
carriage
as
lightly
as
a
bird
she
felt
humiliated
ashamed
of
her
awkward
distorted
body
she
drew
the
foolish
little
cloak
and
scarf
she
had
put
on
anxiously
about
her
people
stared
she
seemed
to
be
the
only
woman
going
to
have
a
child
all
the
others
were
free
unhampered
vigorous
persons
like
ilse
it
was
as
though
she
had
suddenly
grown
old
this
slowness
this
fear
of
not
being
able
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
trucks
and
porters
in
time
in
königsberg
the
noise
in
the
streets
where
the
shops
were
was
deafening
all
the
drays
of
all
the
world
seemed
to
be
spending
that
day
driving
furiously
over
the
stones
and
filled
with
cases
of
empty
beer
bottles
or
empty
milk
cans
or
long
shivering
screaming
iron
laths
while
endless
processions
of
rang
their
bells
at
them
ingeborg
clung
to
ilse
arm
bewildered
after
kökensee
alone
in
its
fields
after
the
dignified
tranquillities
of
redchester
the
noise
hammered
on
her
head
like
showers
of
blows
there
were
not
many
people
about
but
those
there
were
stared
to
the
extent
of
stopping
dead
in
front
of
the
two
women
in
order
not
to
miss
anything
it
was
at
ingeborg
they
stared
ilse
was
a
familiar
figure
just
a
sunburnt
country
girl
with
oiled
hair
in
her
sunday
clothes
but
ingeborg
was
a
foreigner
an
astonishment
men
and
women
stopped
children
loitered
youths
whistled
and
called
out
comments
that
her
slow
german
could
not
follow
she
flushed
and
turned
pale
and
held
on
tighter
to
ilse
she
supposed
she
must
be
looking
more
grotesque
even
than
she
had
feared
she
put
it
all
down
to
her
condition
not
knowing
on
this
her
first
walk
in
a
german
provincial
town
that
it
was
her
being
a
stranger
dressed
a
little
differently
doing
her
hair
a
little
differently
that
caused
the
interest
she
walked
as
quickly
as
she
could
to
get
away
from
these
people
into
a
shop
little
beads
of
effort
round
her
mouth
looking
straight
before
her
fighting
down
a
dreadful
desire
to
cry
and
it
was
with
thankfulness
that
she
sank
on
to
a
chair
in
the
quiet
midday
emptiness
of
berding
and
kühn
drapery
and
linen
establishment
the
young
lady
behind
the
counter
stared
too
but
then
there
was
only
one
of
her
she
very
politely
called
ingeborg
and
inquired
whether
her
child
was
a
boy
or
a
girl
lord
god
cried
ilse
how
should
we
know
but
ingeborg
with
dignity
and
decision
said
it
was
a
boy
then
said
the
young
lady
you
require
blue
ribbons
do
i
said
ingeborg
very
willing
to
believe
her
the
young
lady
sorted
out
small
garments
from
green
calico
boxes
labelled
there
were
little
jackets
little
shirts
little
caps
everything
one
could
need
for
the
upper
portion
of
a
baby
so
said
the
young
lady
pushing
a
pile
of
these
articles
across
the
counter
to
ingeborg
god
god
cried
ilse
in
an
ecstasy
at
such
tininess
thrusting
her
red
thumb
through
one
of
the
diminutive
sleeves
and
holding
it
up
to
show
how
tightly
it
fitted
agreed
the
young
lady
though
without
excitement
but
said
ingeborg
laboriously
searching
out
her
words
the
baby
does
leave
off
there
at
its
middle
it
go
on
it
be
a
whole
baby
it
have
legs
and
things
what
does
one
put
on
the
rest
of
it
the
young
lady
looked
at
ilse
for
enlightenment
it
a
rest
ilse
said
ingeborg
also
appealing
to
her
these
things
are
just
clothes
for
cherubs
said
the
young
lady
visited
by
a
glimmer
of
understanding
and
turning
round
she
dexterously
whipped
down
more
green
boxes
and
taking
off
the
lids
brought
out
squares
of
different
materials
linen
flannel
and
a
soft
white
spongy
stuff
swaddle
she
said
holding
them
up
swaddle
said
ingeborg
swaddle
confirmed
ilse
and
as
ingeborg
only
stared
the
young
lady
gradually
plumbing
her
ignorance
produced
a
small
mattress
in
a
white
and
frilly
linen
bag
and
diving
down
beneath
the
counter
brought
up
a
dusty
doll
which
she
deftly
rolled
up
to
the
armpits
in
the
squares
inserted
it
into
the
bag
with
its
head
out
and
tied
it
firmly
with
tapes
so
she
said
giving
this
neat
object
a
resounding
slap
and
picking
it
up
she
pretended
to
rock
it
fondly
in
her
arms
behold
the
first
born
she
said
after
that
ingeborg
put
herself
entirely
into
these
experienced
hands
she
bought
all
she
was
told
to
she
even
bought
the
doll
to
practise
on
it
will
not
do
of
course
explained
the
young
lady
the
one
thing
she
would
not
buy
was
a
sewing
machine
to
make
her
own
swaddle
with
as
ilse
economically
counselled
the
young
lady
was
against
this
purchase
which
could
only
be
made
in
another
shop
she
said
true
ladies
always
preferred
berding
and
kühn
to
do
such
work
for
them
ilse
said
true
mothers
always
did
it
for
themselves
and
it
was
one
of
the
chief
joys
of
this
blessed
time
ilse
said
seeing
the
house
grow
fuller
and
fuller
of
swaddle
at
this
the
young
lady
pursed
her
lips
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
assumed
an
air
of
waiting
indifference
ilse
resenting
her
attitude
inquired
of
her
heatedly
what
then
she
knew
of
the
young
lady
for
some
reason
was
offended
at
this
though
nothing
was
more
certain
than
that
knowledge
of
would
have
meant
instant
dismissal
from
berding
and
kühn
it
became
a
wrangle
across
the
counter
and
was
only
ended
by
ingeborg
altogether
siding
with
the
young
lady
and
the
interests
of
berding
and
kühn
and
ordering
as
the
baroness
had
directed
ten
dozen
each
of
the
squares
die
if
i
had
to
hem
ten
dozen
of
anything
she
explained
apologetically
to
ilse
and
it
was
very
bitter
to
ilse
who
meant
well
to
see
the
young
lady
look
at
her
with
a
meditative
comprehensiveness
down
her
nose
it
left
no
honourable
course
open
to
her
but
to
sulk
and
in
her
heart
she
would
rather
not
have
sulked
on
this
exciting
and
unusual
excursion
she
was
forced
to
however
by
her
own
public
opinion
and
she
did
it
vigorously
thoroughly
blackly
all
the
rest
of
the
day
all
the
way
home
and
neither
cakes
nor
chocolate
nor
ices
earnestly
and
successively
applied
to
her
by
ingeborg
at
the
pastrycook
were
allowed
to
lighten
the
gloom
but
i
suppose
ingeborg
said
to
herself
as
she
crept
into
her
bed
that
night
in
the
spiritless
mood
called
philosophical
for
ilse
was
her
stay
and
refuge
and
to
have
her
not
speaking
to
her
to
feel
she
had
hurt
her
was
a
grievous
thing
a
thing
when
one
is
weary
very
like
the
last
straw
i
suppose
it
all
really
only
a
part
of
oh
oh
she
added
with
a
sudden
flare
of
rebellion
that
died
out
immediately
in
shame
of
it
i
do
think
i
b
i
do
think
i
b
chapter
xix
there
was
nevertheless
an
absorption
and
an
excitement
about
this
new
strange
business
that
did
not
for
a
moment
allow
her
to
be
dull
she
might
feel
ill
wretched
exhausted
but
she
was
always
interested
a
tremendous
event
was
ahead
of
her
and
all
her
days
were
working
up
to
it
she
lived
in
preparation
each
one
of
her
sensations
was
a
preparation
an
advance
there
was
a
necessity
for
it
something
was
being
made
was
growing
had
to
be
completed
life
was
full
of
meaning
and
of
plain
meaning
she
understood
and
saw
reasons
everywhere
for
what
happened
to
her
things
had
to
be
so
if
one
wanted
the
supreme
crown
and
her
part
of
the
work
was
really
very
easy
it
was
just
to
be
patient
she
was
often
depressed
but
only
because
the
month
seemed
so
endless
and
she
was
so
tired
of
her
discomfort
never
because
she
was
afraid
she
had
no
fears
for
she
had
no
experience
she
contemplated
the
final
part
of
the
adventure
the
part
ilse
alluded
to
cheerfully
as
her
difficult
hour
with
the
perfect
tranquillity
of
ignorance
on
the
whole
she
was
very
free
from
the
moods
herr
dremmel
had
braced
himself
to
bear
and
continued
right
through
not
to
be
exacting
she
had
no
examples
of
more
fussed
over
and
tended
women
before
her
eyes
to
upset
her
contentment
and
saw
for
herself
how
the
village
women
in
like
condition
worked
on
at
their
and
in
the
fields
up
to
the
end
besides
she
had
been
trained
in
a
healthy
she
only
cried
once
but
then
it
was
february
and
enough
to
make
anybody
cry
with
the
sleet
stinging
the
windows
and
the
wind
howling
round
the
dark
little
house
she
put
it
down
to
february
a
month
she
had
never
thought
anything
of
and
hid
from
herself
as
she
hurriedly
wiped
away
her
tears
where
did
they
all
come
from
that
she
was
disgracefully
crying
because
she
had
been
alone
so
long
and
ilse
had
gone
out
somewhere
without
asking
and
robert
had
spoken
to
her
for
days
and
there
was
nobody
to
bring
in
the
lamp
if
she
did
fetch
it
herself
and
she
could
fetch
it
because
she
felt
so
funny
and
might
drop
it
and
what
she
wanted
most
in
the
world
was
a
mother
not
a
mother
somewhere
else
away
in
redchester
but
a
real
soft
warm
mother
sitting
beside
her
in
that
room
with
her
the
mother
arm
under
her
ingeborg
head
and
her
ingeborg
face
against
her
the
mother
bosom
a
mother
with
feathers
all
over
her
like
a
kind
hen
would
be
very
ideal
but
short
of
that
there
was
a
soft
black
dress
she
remembered
her
mother
used
to
wear
with
amiable
old
lace
on
it
that
would
scratch
and
the
comfort
it
would
be
the
if
for
half
an
hour
she
might
put
her
cheek
against
this
and
keep
it
there
and
say
nothing
and
she
cried
more
and
more
and
told
herself
more
and
more
eagerly
with
a
kind
of
rage
that
february
was
no
sort
of
month
at
all
when
herr
dremmel
came
out
of
his
laboratory
to
ask
why
his
lamp
had
not
been
brought
and
found
no
light
anywhere
and
no
ilse
when
he
shouted
he
was
vexed
but
when
he
had
fetched
a
lamp
himself
and
put
it
on
the
table
where
it
shone
on
to
ingeborg
swollen
and
blinking
eyes
he
was
still
more
vexed
this
is
foolish
he
said
staring
down
at
her
a
moment
you
will
only
harm
my
child
she
did
not
cry
again
the
spring
had
dried
up
the
roads
but
she
did
not
for
all
that
take
walks
that
obliged
her
to
pass
through
the
village
instead
she
spent
hours
in
the
budding
garden
up
and
down
on
one
of
the
two
available
paths
the
one
at
the
end
on
the
edge
of
the
which
were
now
the
vividest
green
or
the
one
on
the
east
side
of
the
house
beneath
robert
laboratory
windows
where
the
lilacs
grew
his
table
was
at
right
angles
to
the
end
window
and
she
often
stood
on
the
path
watching
him
his
head
bent
over
his
work
in
an
absorption
that
went
on
hour
after
hour
he
kept
the
windows
shut
because
the
spring
disturbed
him
it
had
a
way
of
coming
in
irrepressibly
and
wantoning
among
his
papers
or
throwing
a
handful
of
lilac
blossoms
into
his
rye
samples
or
sending
an
officious
bee
to
lumber
round
him
ingeborg
walked
up
and
down
up
and
down
on
this
path
every
day
taking
the
exercise
baroness
glambeck
had
recommended
and
for
three
weeks
just
this
path
was
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
world
for
it
was
planted
on
either
side
with
ancient
lilac
bushes
and
they
were
a
revelation
to
her
when
they
came
out
after
the
spare
and
frugal
lilacs
in
the
gardens
at
home
above
their
swaying
scented
loveliness
of
light
and
colour
and
shape
she
could
see
robert
head
inside
the
window
bending
over
his
table
every
time
she
came
to
the
end
of
her
tramp
and
turned
round
again
it
was
the
best
part
of
the
whole
nine
months
these
three
weeks
of
lilacs
and
fine
weather
on
that
scented
path
with
robert
busy
and
content
where
she
could
see
him
she
loved
being
able
to
see
him
it
was
a
companionable
thing
by
june
everything
was
ready
the
nursery
was
furnished
the
cradle
trimmed
a
pale
blue
perambulator
blocked
the
passage
neat
stacks
of
little
clothes
filled
the
cupboards
and
frau
dosch
a
hoary
person
of
unseemly
conversation
interviewed
and
told
to
be
on
the
alert
the
idea
of
arranging
for
a
doctor
to
be
on
the
alert
too
would
not
of
itself
have
entered
ingeborg
head
and
nobody
put
it
there
such
a
being
was
indeed
mentioned
once
by
baroness
glambeck
whose
interest
increasing
with
the
months
brought
her
over
several
times
but
only
vaguely
as
some
one
who
had
to
be
sent
for
when
the
midwife
judged
the
patient
to
have
reached
the
stage
then
apparently
the
law
obliged
the
midwife
to
send
for
a
doctor
there
is
much
difference
however
said
the
baroness
between
thinking
one
is
in
extremity
and
really
being
in
it
and
the
patient
was
apt
to
be
biassed
on
these
occasions
she
explained
and
inclined
rashly
to
jump
to
conclusions
therefore
wisdom
dictated
the
leaving
of
such
a
decision
to
the
midwife
yes
said
ingeborg
placidly
of
course
said
the
baroness
all
this
is
different
from
other
illnesses
because
it
is
not
one
yes
said
ingeborg
placidly
and
when
i
speak
of
the
patient
i
do
not
mean
the
patient
because
without
an
illness
there
can
not
be
a
patient
no
said
ingeborg
placidly
nor
without
a
patient
can
there
be
an
illness
no
said
ingeborg
placidly
she
was
leaning
back
in
a
low
chair
watching
the
sun
shining
on
the
tops
of
the
over
her
head
for
it
was
the
end
of
june
and
they
were
in
the
garden
it
all
seemed
very
satisfactory
nobody
was
ill
nobody
was
going
to
be
ill
there
would
be
rather
a
troublesome
moment
that
would
be
met
and
got
over
with
patience
and
frau
dosch
but
no
illness
just
nature
having
its
way
and
then
it
really
seemed
altogether
too
wonderful
that
then
quite
soon
now
perhaps
in
a
week
or
two
any
day
really
there
would
be
a
baby
and
she
was
going
to
love
it
with
this
passion
of
love
that
only
mothers
know
and
it
was
going
to
fill
her
life
most
beautifully
to
the
brim
and
it
would
make
her
so
happy
that
she
would
never
want
anything
but
just
it
that
is
what
they
had
told
her
on
her
own
account
she
had
added
to
this
that
the
baby
would
be
every
bit
as
clever
as
robert
but
with
more
leisure
that
it
would
have
his
brains
but
not
his
laboratory
that
it
would
be
able
it
would
want
to
get
out
of
its
perambulator
and
go
and
lock
itself
up
away
from
her
and
weigh
rye
grains
and
that
it
would
mind
in
fact
it
would
prefer
being
fetched
out
of
its
thoughts
to
come
and
be
kissed
for
ages
for
years
it
was
going
to
be
her
dear
and
close
companion
her
in
the
lake
her
in
god
woods
her
eyes
were
soft
with
joy
at
the
thought
of
how
soon
now
she
was
going
to
be
able
to
tuck
this
precious
being
under
her
arm
and
take
it
with
her
lightly
and
easily
into
the
garden
restored
to
her
own
slim
nimbleness
again
and
point
out
the
exceeding
beauty
of
the
world
to
its
new
astonished
eyes
she
would
show
it
the
and
the
great
sky
she
would
make
it
acquainted
with
the
frogs
and
introduce
it
to
the
bittern
she
would
draw
its
attention
to
the
delight
of
lying
face
downwards
on
hot
grass
where
tufts
of
thyme
grew
and
watching
the
busy
life
among
the
blades
and
roots
she
would
insist
on
its
observing
the
storks
standing
in
their
nest
on
the
stable
roof
and
how
the
light
lay
along
their
white
wings
and
how
the
red
of
their
legs
was
like
the
red
of
the
pollard
willows
in
march
and
at
night
if
it
were
so
as
not
to
sleep
she
would
pick
it
up
and
take
it
to
the
window
and
impress
its
soft
mind
all
over
with
shining
little
stars
wonderful
to
think
that
before
the
lupins
those
august
glories
had
done
flowering
she
would
be
out
among
them
again
only
with
her
son
this
time
her
flesh
of
her
flesh
and
blood
of
her
blood
her
robertlet
baroness
glambeck
watched
her
face
curiously
as
she
lay
looking
up
at
the
sunny
with
the
amused
smile
of
these
thoughts
on
it
it
was
clear
the
frau
pastor
had
forgotten
her
presence
and
even
her
being
so
near
her
difficult
hour
did
not
explain
or
excuse
a
social
lapse
indeed
the
frau
pastor
received
her
visits
with
an
absence
of
excitement
and
of
realisation
of
the
honour
being
done
her
that
was
almost
beyond
the
limits
of
the
forgivable
always
she
behaved
as
though
she
were
an
equal
and
a
particularly
equal
equal
much
however
could
be
excused
in
a
person
who
was
not
only
english
a
nation
the
baroness
had
heard
described
as
rude
but
so
near
her
first
confinement
when
this
was
over
there
would
be
a
severe
readjustment
of
relationships
but
meanwhile
one
could
not
really
be
angry
with
her
just
her
amazing
and
terrible
ignorance
of
the
simplest
facts
connected
with
made
it
impossible
to
be
angry
with
her
she
reminded
the
baroness
of
a
sheep
going
tranquilly
to
the
slaughter
quite
pleased
with
the
promenade
quite
without
a
thought
of
what
lay
at
the
end
of
it
did
english
mothers
then
all
keep
their
daughters
in
such
darkness
on
the
one
great
subject
for
a
woman
for
some
subtle
reason
the
expression
of
extreme
placidness
on
ingeborg
face
as
she
lay
silently
watching
the
and
planning
what
she
would
do
with
her
baby
annoyed
the
baroness
it
will
hurt
you
know
she
said
ingeborg
brought
her
gaze
slowly
down
to
earth
again
and
looked
at
her
a
moment
what
she
said
it
will
hurt
repeated
the
baroness
oh
yes
said
ingeborg
i
know
but
it
all
natural
certainly
it
is
natural
nevertheless
the
baroness
stopped
grimly
screwed
up
her
mouth
and
shook
her
head
three
times
with
an
awful
suggestiveness
ingeborg
looked
at
her
and
then
suddenly
some
words
out
of
her
days
at
redchester
flashed
into
her
mind
she
had
totally
forgotten
them
and
now
her
memory
began
jerking
them
together
they
came
she
knew
in
the
somewhere
was
it
in
the
litany
no
but
anyhow
they
were
in
that
truthful
book
the
book
of
common
prayer
and
they
were
yes
that
was
it
great
danger
of
yes
and
again
great
pain
and
peril
of
a
quick
flush
came
into
her
face
and
for
the
first
time
a
look
of
fear
into
her
eyes
she
sat
up
leaning
on
both
her
hands
and
stared
at
the
baroness
is
it
so
very
dreadful
she
asked
the
baroness
merely
shook
her
head
it
ca
be
said
ingeborg
watching
the
baroness
expression
in
search
of
agreement
or
there
would
be
any
mothers
left
the
baroness
went
on
screwing
up
her
mouth
and
shaking
her
head
it
must
be
said
ingeborg
again
anxiously
the
baroness
would
not
commit
herself
they
die
you
see
if
it
was
the
mothers
all
would
but
there
seem
her
voice
trembled
a
little
in
her
desire
for
the
agreement
there
seem
to
be
lots
of
mothers
still
about
she
paused
but
the
baroness
continued
not
to
commit
herself
i
can
bear
anything
said
ingeborg
with
a
great
show
of
pride
and
a
voice
that
trembled
if
it
if
it
reasonable
it
is
not
reasonable
said
the
baroness
it
is
the
will
of
god
oh
that
the
same
thing
the
same
thing
said
ingeborg
throwing
herself
back
on
her
cushions
and
nervously
pulling
some
white
pinks
she
had
been
smelling
to
pieces
she
was
ashamed
of
her
terror
but
all
that
evening
she
was
restless
and
nervous
struggling
with
this
new
feeling
of
fear
she
could
not
keep
still
but
walked
about
the
while
robert
ate
his
supper
at
the
table
pressing
her
cold
hands
together
trying
to
reason
herself
into
tranquillity
again
she
stood
still
a
moment
watching
robert
quiet
black
back
as
he
bent
over
his
supper
then
she
went
over
to
him
impulsively
and
rubbed
both
her
hands
quickly
through
his
hair
which
had
not
been
cut
for
some
time
making
it
stand
up
on
ends
there
she
said
now
you
look
sweet
and
she
bent
and
kissed
him
lingeringly
on
the
back
of
his
neck
he
was
near
her
he
was
alive
she
could
hold
on
to
him
for
a
little
before
she
went
alone
into
whatever
it
was
of
icy
and
awful
and
unknown
that
waited
for
her
good
little
wife
he
said
still
going
on
eating
but
putting
his
left
arm
round
her
while
his
right
continued
to
do
what
was
necessary
with
the
supper
and
not
looking
up
his
affection
at
this
time
had
watered
down
into
a
mild
theory
she
was
not
a
wife
to
him
though
he
called
her
so
she
was
a
this
herr
dremmel
told
himself
when
he
too
felt
bored
by
the
length
of
the
months
is
a
most
honourable
creditable
and
respectable
condition
but
no
man
can
feel
warm
towards
a
condition
his
little
sheep
had
disappeared
into
the
immensities
of
the
he
would
be
glad
when
she
was
restored
to
him
the
next
day
she
got
a
letter
from
bullivant
dated
from
the
master
house
ananias
college
oxford
may
interest
you
to
wrote
bullivant
your
sister

a
little
daughter
the
child

born
at
daybreak
this
morning
i
am
worn
out
with
watching
it

a
very
fine
little
girl
and
both
mother
and
child
are
doing
well
i
am
not
doing
well
at
all
we
had
that
excellent
williamson
i
am
thankful
to
say
or
i
do
know
what
would
have
happened
of
course
our
darling
judith
was
mercifully
spared
knowing
anything
about
it
for
she
was
kept
well
under
chloroform
but
i
knew
and
i

very
upset
i
only
wish
i
too
could
have
been
chloroformed
during
those
anxious
hours
as
it
is
i
am
suffering
much
from
shock
and
it
will
be
a
long
while
before
i
recover
williamson
says
that
on
these
occasions
he
always
pities
most
the
mothers
of
the
mothers
your
but
here
ingeborg
let
the
letter
drop
to
the
floor
and
sat
thinking
when
robert
came
in
to
dinner
late
that
day
hot
and
pleased
from
his
fields
which
were
doing
particularly
well
after
the
warm
rains
of
several
admirably
timed
thunderstorms
she
gave
him
his
food
and
waited
till
he
had
eaten
it
and
begun
to
smoke
and
then
asked
him
if
she
were
going
to
have
chloroform
chloroform
he
repeated
gazing
at
her
while
he
fetched
back
his
thoughts
from
their
pleasurable
lingering
among
his
fields
what
for
so
that
i
do
know
about
anything
mother
writes
judith
had
some
she
got
a
little
girl
herr
dremmel
took
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
and
stared
at
her
she
was
leaning
both
elbows
on
the
table
at
her
end
and
with
her
chin
on
her
hands
was
looking
at
him
with
very
bright
eyes
but
this
is
cowardice
he
said
i
some
chloroform
said
ingeborg
it
is
against
nature
said
herr
dremmel
i
some
chloroform
said
ingeborg
you
have
before
you
said
herr
dremmel
endeavouring
to
be
patient
an
entirely
natural
process
as
natural
as
going
to
sleep
at
night
and
waking
up
next
morning
it
may
be
as
natural
said
ingeborg
but
i
do
believe
it
as
nice
i
some
chloroform
what
not
nice
when
it
is
going
to
introduce
you
to
the
supreme
i
know
but
i
i
have
a
feeling
it
going
to
introduce
me
rather
roughly
i
some
chloroform
god
said
herr
dremmel
solemnly
has
arranged
these
introductions
himself
and
it
is
not
for
us
to
criticise
that
the
first
time
said
ingeborg
that
you
talked
like
a
bishop
you
might
be
a
bishop
when
it
comes
to
the
highest
things
said
herr
dremmel
severely
and
this
is
the
holiest
most
exalted
act
a
human
being
can
perpetrate
all
men
are
equally
believers
i
expect
they
are
said
ingeborg
but
the
others
the
ones
who
not
men
they
some
chloroform
no
healthy
normally
built
woman
needs
it
said
herr
dremmel
greatly
irritated
by
this
persistence
no
doctor
would
give
it
besides
there
will
not
be
a
doctor
and
the
midwife
may
not
administer
it
why
i
do
not
recognise
my
little
wife
my
little
intelligent
wife
who
must
know
that
nothing
is
being
required
of
her
but
that
which
is
done
by
other
women
every
day
i
do
see
what
being
intelligent
has
to
do
with
this
said
ingeborg
and
i
some
chloroform
herr
dremmel
looked
at
her
bright
eyes
and
flushed
cheeks
in
astonishment
up
to
now
she
had
rejoiced
in
her
condition
whenever
he
mentioned
it
and
indeed
he
could
see
no
reason
for
any
other
attitude
she
had
apparently
felt
very
little
that
was
not
pleasant
during
the
whole
time
known
none
of
those
distresses
he
had
heard
that
women
sometimes
endure
been
healthily
free
from
complications
there
had
been
moods
it
is
true
and
he
had
occasionally
found
her
lounging
on
sofas
but
then
women
easily
become
lazy
at
these
times
it
had
all
been
normal
and
would
no
doubt
continue
normal
what
then
was
this
shrinking
at
the
eleventh
hour
this
inability
to
be
as
ordinarily
courageous
as
every
peasant
woman
in
the
place
it
was
a
most
unfortunate
unpleasant
whim
the
most
unfortunate
she
could
have
had
he
had
been
prepared
for
whims
but
had
always
supposed
they
would
be
tinned
pine
apples
of
course
he
was
not
going
to
humour
her
too
much
was
at
stake
he
had
heard
anæsthetics
were
harmful
on
these
occasions
harmful
and
entirely
unnecessary
the
best
thing
by
far
for
the
child
was
the
absence
of
everything
except
nature
nature
in
this
matter
should
be
given
a
free
hand
she
was
not
always
wise
he
knew
from
his
experience
with
his
fields
but
in
this
department
he
was
informed
she
should
be
left
completely
to
herself
if
his
wife
was
so
soft
as
not
to
be
able
to
bear
a
little
pain
what
sort
of
sons
was
she
likely
to
give
him
a
breed
of
shrinkers
a
breed
of
hiders
why
he
had
not
asked
for
gas
even
when
he
had
three
teeth
out
at
one
sitting
two
years
before
it
was
the
dentist
who
had
insisted
he
should
have
it
and
that
was
only
teeth
objects
of
no
value
afterwards
but
to
have
one
son
handicapped
at
the
very
beginning
because
his
mother
was
not
unselfish
enough
to
endure
a
little
for
his
sake
ingeborg
got
up
and
came
and
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
whispered
i
frightened
she
breathed
robert
i
frightened
then
he
took
her
to
the
sofa
and
made
her
sit
down
beside
him
while
he
reasoned
with
her
he
reasoned
for
at
least
twenty
minutes
taking
great
pains
and
being
patient
he
told
her
she
was
not
really
frightened
but
that
her
physical
condition
caused
her
to
fancy
she
thought
she
was
ingeborg
was
interested
by
this
and
readily
admitted
that
it
was
possible
he
told
her
about
the
simple
courage
of
the
other
women
in
kökensee
and
ingeborg
agreed
for
she
had
seen
it
herself
he
told
her
how
god
had
arranged
she
should
bring
forth
in
sorrow
but
she
fidgeted
and
began
again
to
talk
of
bishops
he
told
her
it
would
only
be
a
few
hours
suffering
perhaps
less
and
that
in
return
there
was
a
lifetime
joy
for
them
in
their
child
she
listened
attentively
to
this
was
quite
quiet
for
a
few
minutes
then
slid
her
hand
into
his
he
told
her
she
might
by
letting
herself
go
to
fear
hurt
her
child
and
would
she
not
in
that
case
find
difficulty
afterwards
in
forgiving
herself
this
completed
her
cure
an
enormous
courage
took
the
place
of
her
misgivings
she
rose
up
from
the
sofa
so
superfluously
brave
so
glowing
with
enterprise
that
she
wanted
to
begin
at
once
that
she
might
show
how
much
she
could
cheerfully
endure
as
though
she
said
lifting
her
chin
i
could
stand
what
other
women
stand
as
though
i
stand
sooner
than
hurt
my
baby
and
she
flung
back
her
head
in
the
proudest
defiance
of
whatever
might
be
ahead
of
her
her
baby
her
husband
her
happy
home
to
suffer
for
these
would
be
beautiful
if
it
were
not
such
a
little
thing
almost
too
little
to
offer
up
at
their
dear
altar
she
would
have
been
transfigured
by
her
shining
thoughts
if
any
thing
could
have
transfigured
her
but
no
thoughts
however
bright
could
pierce
through
that
sad
body
her
outlines
were
not
the
outlines
for
heroic
attitudes
she
not
only
had
a
double
chin
she
seemed
to
be
doubled
all
over
she
looked
the
queerest
figure
heavy
uncouth
ugly
standing
there
passionately
expressing
her
readiness
to
begin
and
herr
dremmel
unconsciously
seeing
this
and
bored
by
having
had
to
explain
the
obvious
at
such
length
and
spend
a
valuable
half
hour
bringing
a
woman
to
reason
why
could
they
never
go
to
it
by
themselves
wasted
no
more
words
having
got
her
there
but
brushed
a
hasty
kiss
across
her
hair
and
went
away
looking
at
his
watch
and
next
day
just
as
she
was
putting
the
potatoes
into
that
that
so
much
simplified
her
cooking
she
uttered
a
small
exclamation
and
turned
quickly
to
ilse
with
a
look
of
startled
questioning
asked
ilse
pausing
in
the
wiping
dry
of
a
wooden
ladle
i
do
know
said
ingeborg
gasping
a
little
no
she
added
after
a
minute
during
which
they
stood
staring
at
each
other
it
anything
and
she
went
on
with
the
potatoes
but
when
presently
there
was
another
little
fluttering
exclamation
ilse
with
great
decision
laid
down
her
gloomy
and
sought
out
johann
herr
dremmel
not
having
come
in
and
bade
him
harness
the
horses
and
fetch
frau
dosch
the
first
thing
said
frau
dosch
arriving
two
hours
later
surprisingly
brisk
and
considering
her
age
and
the
heat
the
first
thing
is
to
plait
your
hair
in
two
plaits
and
still
later
when
ingeborg
had
left
off
pretending
or
trying
to
be
anything
at
all
when
courage
and
unselfishness
and
stoicism
and
a
desire
to
please
robert
who
was
robert
were
like
toys
for
games
shoved
aside
in
these
grips
with
death
frau
dosch
nodded
her
head
philosophically
while
she
ate
and
drank
from
the
trays
ilse
kept
on
bringing
her
and
said
at
regular
intervals
was
sein
muss
sein
muss
such
were
the
consolations
of
frau
dosch
chapter
xx
these
things
began
on
tuesday
at
midday
and
on
wednesday
night
so
late
that
bats
and
moths
were
busy
in
the
garden
and
often
in
the
room
frau
dosch
grown
very
wispy
about
the
hair
and
abandoned
in
the
dress
dabbed
a
bundle
of
swaddle
with
a
small
red
face
emerging
from
it
down
on
to
the
bed
beside
ingeborg
and
said
tired
but
triumphant
there
the
great
moment
had
come
the
supreme
moment
of
a
woman
life
herr
dremmel
was
present
dishevelled
and
ilse
was
present
glowing
and
hot
it
was
a
boy
a
magnificent
boy
frau
dosch
pronounced
and
the
three
stood
watching
for
the
first
ray
of
the
first
illumination
that
was
to
light
the
face
on
the
pillow
there
said
frau
dosch
but
ingeborg
did
not
open
her
eyes
there
said
frau
dosch
again
picking
up
the
bundle
and
laying
it
slantwise
on
ingeborg
breast
and
addressing
her
very
loudly
frau
pastor
rouse
yourself
behold
your
son
a
splendid
boy
almost
a
man
already
she
took
ingeborg
arm
and
laid
it
round
the
bundle
it
slid
off
and
hung
over
the
edge
of
the
bed
as
before
tut
tut
said
frau
dosch
becoming
scandalised
and
stooping
down
she
shouted
into
ingeborg
ear
frau
pastor
wake
up
look
at
your
son
a
magnificent
fellow
with
a
chest
i
tell
you
oh
but
he
will
break
the
hearts
of
the
maidens
he
will
still
the
blankest
indifference
on
the
face
on
the
pillow
herr
dremmel
knelt
down
so
as
to
be
on
a
level
with
it
and
took
the
limp
damp
hand
hanging
down
in
his
and
patted
it
little
wife
he
said
in
german
it
is
all
over
open
your
eyes
and
rejoice
with
me
in
our
new
happiness
you
have
given
me
a
son
said
frau
dosch
emphatically
you
have
filled
my
cup
with
joy
said
frau
dosch
still
louder
open
your
eyes
and
welcome
him
to
his
mother
heart
said
frau
dosch
indignantly
then
ingeborg
did
slowly
open
her
eyes
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
hardly
lift
their
heavy
lids
and
looked
at
robert
as
though
she
were
looking
at
him
from
an
immense
distance
her
mouth
remained
open
her
face
was
vacant
frau
dosch
seized
the
bundle
and
with
clucking
sounds
jerked
it
up
and
down
between
the
faces
of
the
parents
so
that
its
mother
eyes
must
needs
fall
upon
it
its
red
contents
began
to
cry
ah
there
now
now
we
shall
see
exclaimed
frau
dosch
who
had
been
secretly
perturbed
by
the
newborn
absence
of
comment
while
it
was
being
washed
and
swaddled
the
first
cry
of
our
son
said
herr
dremmel
kissing
ingeborg
hand
with
deep
emotion
we
will
try
said
frau
dosch
once
more
laying
the
baby
on
ingeborg
chest
and
folding
her
arm
round
it
this
time
she
took
the
precaution
to
hold
the
mother
arm
firmly
in
position
herself
oh
the
splendid
fellow
she
exclaimed
frau
pastor
what
do
you
say
to
your
eldest
son
but
frau
pastor
said
nothing
her
eyelids
drooped
over
her
eyes
again
and
shut
the
world
and
all
its
vigours
out
the
sound
of
these
people
round
her
bed
came
to
her
from
far
away
there
was
a
singing
in
her
ears
a
black
remoteness
in
her
soul
somewhere
from
behind
the
vast
sea
of
nothingness
in
which
she
seemed
to
sink
through
the
constant
singing
in
her
ears
came
little
faint
voices
with
words
she
wanted
to
listen
she
wanted
to
listen
why
would
these
people
interrupt
her
the
same
words
over
and
over
again
faintly
throbbing
in
a
rhythm
like
the
rhythm
of
the
wheels
of
the
train
that
had
brought
her
through
the
night
long
ago
across
europe
to
her
german
home
only
very
distant
tiny
muffled
from
battle
and
murder
yes
she
had
caught
that
from
all
women
labouring
with
child
yes
from
all
sick
persons
yes
and
young
children
yes
go
on
good
lord
deliver
us
oh
yes
please
good
lord
deliver
us
please
please
deliver
us
perhaps
a
little
brandy
suggested
herr
dremmel
puzzled
brandy
if
her
own
son
can
not
cheer
her
does
the
herr
pastor
then
not
know
that
one
gives
nothing
at
first
to
a
lady
but
herr
dremmel
feeling
ignorant
let
go
the
idea
of
brandy
her
hand
is
rather
cold
he
said
almost
apologetically
for
who
knew
but
what
it
was
cold
because
it
ought
to
be
frau
dosch
expressed
the
opinion
that
it
was
not
and
that
if
it
were
it
was
not
so
cold
as
her
heart
see
here
she
said
see
this
beautiful
boy
addressing
his
mother
in
the
only
language
he
knows
and
she
not
even
looking
at
him
come
my
little
fellow
come
then
we
are
not
wanted
come
with
aunt
dosch
the
old
aunt
dosch
and
she
took
the
baby
off
ingeborg
passive
chest
and
after
a
few
turns
with
it
up
and
down
the
room
slapping
the
underside
of
its
swaddle
in
a
way
experience
had
taught
choked
out
crying
put
it
in
the
pale
blue
cradle
that
stood
ready
on
two
chairs
well
well
said
herr
dremmel
getting
up
for
his
knees
were
hurting
him
and
looking
at
his
watch
it
is
bedtime
for
all
of
us
it
is
past
midnight
after
a
sleep
my
wife
will
be
herself
again
he
went
towards
the
door
followed
by
ilse
with
one
of
the
two
lamps
that
were
adding
to
the
stifling
heat
in
the
room
then
paused
and
looked
back
ingeborg
was
lying
as
before
you
are
sure
only
he
said
hesitating
is
that
will
that
by
the
time
it
reaches
my
son
nourish
him
for
all
answer
frau
dosch
advanced
heavily
and
shut
the
door
she
was
tired
to
death
she
was
not
at
that
hour
of
the
night
going
to
defend
her
methods
to
a
husband
she
locked
the
door
and
began
pulling
off
her
dress
she
could
hardly
stand
it
had
been
one
of
those
perfectly
normal
births
that
yet
are
endless
and
half
kill
an
honest
midwife
who
is
not
as
young
as
she
used
to
be
before
dropping
on
to
the
bed
provided
for
her
she
took
a
final
look
at
the
object
in
the
cradle
which
was
noiselessly
sleeping
and
then
at
the
other
object
on
the
bed
which
was
lying
as
before
well
if
the
frau
pastor
preferred
behaving
like
a
log
instead
of
a
proud
mother
frau
dosch
shrugged
her
shoulder
put
on
a
coloured
dimity
jacket
over
her
petticoat
kicked
off
her
slippers
and
went
stockinged
and
hairpinned
to
bed
and
to
instant
sleep
but
the
life
in
the
parsonage
puzzled
herr
dremmel
during
the
next
few
weeks
he
had
expected
the
simple
joys
of
realised
family
happiness
to
succeed
the
act
of
birth
it
was
a
reasonable
expectation
it
occurred
in
other
houses
he
had
been
patient
for
nine
months
supported
during
their
interminableness
by
the
thought
that
what
he
bore
would
be
amply
made
up
to
him
at
the
end
of
them
by
a
delighted
young
wife
restored
to
him
in
her
slenderness
and
health
running
singing
about
the
house
with
a
healthy
son
in
her
arms
the
son
was
there
and
seemed
satisfactory
but
where
was
the
healthy
young
wife
and
as
for
running
about
the
house
when
the
fifth
day
came
the
day
on
which
the
other
women
in
the
parish
got
up
and
began
to
be
brisk
again
ingeborg
made
no
sign
of
even
being
aware
it
was
expected
of
her
she
looked
at
him
vaguely
when
he
suggested
it
with
the
same
vagueness
and
want
of
interest
in
anything
with
which
she
lay
for
hours
staring
out
of
the
window
her
mouth
always
a
little
open
her
position
always
the
same
unless
ilse
came
and
changed
it
for
her
frau
dosch
had
left
the
morning
after
the
birth
according
to
the
custom
of
midwives
returning
on
each
of
the
three
following
mornings
to
wash
the
mother
and
child
and
after
that
ilse
had
taken
over
these
duties
and
as
far
as
he
could
see
performed
them
with
zeal
and
vigour
everything
was
done
that
could
be
done
why
then
did
ingeborg
remain
apathetic
and
uninterested
in
bed
and
not
take
the
trouble
even
to
shut
her
mouth
he
was
puzzled
and
disappointed
the
days
passed
and
nothing
was
changed
he
could
not
but
view
these
manifestations
of
want
of
backbone
with
uneasiness
occurring
as
they
did
in
the
mother
of
his
children
the
least
thing
that
was
demanded
of
her
in
the
way
of
exertion
made
her
break
out
into
a
perspiration
she
had
not
yet
so
far
as
he
knew
voluntarily
put
her
arms
once
round
her
son
ilse
had
to
hold
them
round
him
she
had
not
even
said
anything
about
him
he
might
have
been
a
girl
for
any
pride
she
showed
and
that
holiest
function
of
a
mother
the
nursing
of
her
child
instead
of
being
a
recurring
joy
was
a
recurring
and
apparently
increasing
difficulty
he
had
pointed
out
to
her
that
it
was
not
only
the
greatest
privilege
of
a
mother
to
nurse
her
child
but
it
was
an
established
fact
that
it
gave
her
the
deepest
the
holiest
satisfaction
in
all
pictures
where
there
is
a
mother
he
had
reminded
her
she
is
invariably
either
nursing
or
has
just
been
doing
so
and
on
her
face
is
the
satisfied
serenity
that
attends
the
fulfilment
of
natural
functions
she
had
not
answered
and
her
face
remained
turned
away
and
flushed
with
beads
rolling
down
it
ilse
held
the
baby
he
observed
there
was
a
most
regrettable
want
of
hold
in
his
wife
and
she
appeared
to
have
odd
fancies
she
imagined
for
instance
that
the
pieces
of
buttered
bread
ilse
put
on
a
plate
and
laid
beside
her
on
her
bed
at
were
stuck
to
the
plate
he
had
found
her
struggling
one
afternoon
and
becoming
hot
endeavouring
to
lift
one
of
these
pieces
up
off
the
plate
he
had
asked
her
ilse
not
being
in
the
room
what
she
was
doing
as
usual
she
had
whispered
it
was
another
of
her
fancies
that
she
had
lost
her
voice
and
when
he
bent
down
he
found
that
she
was
whispering
the
word
he
had
taken
up
the
piece
to
show
her
she
was
mistaken
and
had
shaken
the
plate
and
made
all
the
pieces
on
it
spring
about
and
she
had
watched
him
and
then
begun
over
again
to
behave
as
if
she
could
not
lift
one
then
she
dropped
her
hands
down
on
to
the
sheet
and
looked
up
at
him
and
began
to
whisper
something
else
she
whispered
but
not
he
was
glad
to
say
without
at
least
some
sort
of
a
slight
smile
indicating
her
awareness
that
she
was
conducting
herself
childishly
and
ilse
coming
in
had
taken
the
bread
and
fed
her
as
if
it
were
she
who
were
the
baby
and
not
his
son
herr
dremmel
therefore
was
both
puzzled
and
worried
he
was
still
more
puzzled
and
worried
when
on
the
very
day
week
after
the
birth
ilse
came
to
him
and
said
that
frau
pastor
was
shaking
her
bed
about
and
that
she
feared
if
she
did
not
soon
stop
the
bed
which
was
enfeebled
as
herr
pastor
knew
by
having
two
mended
legs
among
its
four
might
break
she
had
reminded
frau
pastor
of
this
but
she
did
not
seem
to
care
and
continued
to
shake
it
the
good
bed
said
ilse
the
excellent
bed
the
best
we
have
in
the
house
would
herr
pastor
step
across
herr
pastor
stepped
across
and
found
ingeborg
shivering
with
such
astonishing
energy
that
the
bed
did
as
ilse
had
described
rattle
threateningly
in
reply
to
his
questions
ilse
told
him
for
ingeborg
was
too
busy
shaking
to
explain
that
nothing
had
happened
except
that
frau
pastor
said
she
was
thirsty
and
would
like
a
glass
of
cold
water
and
she
had
fetched
it
fresh
from
the
pump
and
frau
pastor
had
asked
to
be
held
up
to
drink
it
and
had
drunk
it
all
at
one
draught
and
immediately
fallen
back
and
begun
this
shaking
ingeborg
what
is
this
said
herr
dremmel
with
a
show
of
severity
for
he
had
heard
severity
acted
as
a
sedative
on
those
who
for
instance
shake
when
however
ingeborg
instead
of
replying
like
a
reasonable
being
continued
to
shake
and
seem
unaware
of
his
presence
and
when
on
touching
her
he
found
that
in
spite
of
the
shivering
she
was
extremely
hot
he
sent
johann
for
frau
dosch
who
on
seeing
her
could
only
suggest
that
johann
should
drive
on
into
meuk
and
bring
out
the
doctor
and
so
it
was
that
ingeborg
coming
suddenly
out
of
a
thin
high
confusion
in
which
she
seemed
to
have
been
hurrying
since
the
world
began
found
it
was
night
for
lamps
were
alight
and
people
many
people
were
round
her
bed
and
one
was
a
man
she
did
not
know
with
a
short
black
beard
but
she
did
know
him
it
was
the
doctor
it
flashed
across
her
instantly
then
she
had
really
got
to
being
in
extremity
that
woman
had
said
so
that
big
woman
who
used
to
come
and
see
her
in
the
garden
long
ago
and
ilse
that
was
ilse
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
crying
when
one
was
in
extremity
ilse
did
cry
she
found
herself
stroking
the
doctor
beard
and
begging
him
not
to
let
go
of
her
she
was
reminded
that
it
was
unusual
to
stroke
the
doctor
beard
by
his
drawing
back
but
she
thought
it
silly
not
to
let
one
beard
be
stroked
if
somebody
wanted
to
she
heard
herself
saying
do
let
go
of
me
please
do
let
go
of
me
please
but
it
seemed
that
he
could
not
hold
her
for
she
was
caught
away
almost
immediately
again
into
that
thin
hot
hurrying
confusion
high
up
in
the
treble
high
up
at
the
very
top
where
all
the
violins
were
insisting
together
over
and
over
again
on
one
thin
quivering
anxious
note
it
is
impossible
said
the
doctor
a
jew
from
königsberg
lately
married
and
set
up
at
menk
looking
at
frau
dosch
that
this
should
have
happened
and
he
proceeded
to
explain
to
herr
dremmel
that
the
child
in
future
would
have
to
seek
its
nourishment
in
tins
what
exclaimed
herr
dremmel
tins
said
the
doctor
tins
for
my
son
when
there
are
cows
in
the
world
cows
which
at
least
more
closely
resemble
mothers
than
tins
tins
repeated
the
doctor
firmly
herr
pastor
cows
have
moods
just
as
frequently
as
women
they
are
fed
unwisely
and
behold
immediately
a
mood
not
having
the
gift
of
tongues
they
can
not
convey
their
mood
by
speech
and
baffled
at
one
end
they
fall
back
upon
the
other
and
express
their
malignancies
in
milk
herr
dremmel
was
silent
the
complications
and
difficulties
of
family
life
were
being
lit
up
into
a
picture
at
which
he
could
only
gaze
in
dismay
on
the
bed
ingeborg
was
ceaselessly
turning
her
head
from
one
side
to
the
other
and
rubbing
her
hands
weakly
up
and
down
up
and
down
over
the
sheet
while
he
talked
the
doctor
was
watching
her
frau
dosch
stood
looking
on
with
a
mouth
ilse
wept
the
baby
whimpered
the
doctor
said
he
would
send
some
tins
of
patent
food
out
by
johann
on
his
return
journey
if
there
should
be
much
delay
and
the
baby
was
noisy
said
the
doctor
a
little
water
water
my
son
fed
on
water
exclaimed
herr
dremmel
heavens
above
us
what
diet
is
this
for
a
good
german
tins
and
water
in
the
place
of
blood
and
iron
the
doctor
shrugged
his
shoulder
and
gently
putting
down
hand
which
he
had
been
holding
for
a
moment
to
see
if
he
could
quiet
it
prepared
to
go
away
saying
he
would
also
send
out
a
nurse
ahh
said
herr
dremmel
greatly
relieved
you
know
of
a
thoroughly
healthy
wet
one
completely
dry
for
frau
pastor
impossible
to
leave
her
unnursed
there
will
be
bandages
there
must
be
punctuality
and
care
he
looked
at
frau
dosch
cleanliness
efficiency
at
each
word
he
looked
at
frau
dosch
i
will
come
out
perfectly
normal
perfectly
normal
he
said
as
he
got
into
the
carriage
while
herr
dremmel
stood
ruefully
on
the
doorstep
the
illness
went
its
perfectly
normal
course
a
nurse
came
out
from
the
principal
königsberg
hospital
and
the
disordered
house
at
once
became
perfectly
normal
too
ilse
returned
to
her
kitchen
the
baby
was
appeased
by
its
scientific
diet
ingeborg
bed
grew
smooth
and
spotless
her
room
was
quiet
nobody
knocked
any
more
against
the
foot
of
the
bed
in
passing
or
shook
the
floor
and
herself
by
heavy
treading
she
was
no
longer
tended
with
the
same
vigour
that
made
the
kitchen
floor
spotless
and
the
pig
happy
bandages
unguents
and
disinfectants
stood
neatly
in
rows
clean
white
cloths
covered
the
tables
the
windows
were
wide
open
day
and
night
and
lamps
left
off
burning
exactly
where
they
shone
into
her
eyes
everything
was
normal
including
the
behaviour
of
the
abscess
which
went
its
calm
way
unhurried
and
undisturbed
by
anything
the
doctor
tried
to
do
to
it
ripening
reaching
its
perfection
declining
in
an
order
and
obedience
to
causation
that
was
beautiful
for
those
capable
of
appreciating
it
everything
was
normal
except
the
inside
of
ingeborg
mind
there
in
a
black
recess
crouched
fear
she
suspected
life
she
had
lost
on
that
awful
night
and
day
and
night
again
of
birth
confidence
in
it
she
knew
it
now
it
was
all
death
death
and
cruelty
death
and
nameless
horror
death
pretending
death
waiting
waiting
to
be
cruel
again
to
get
her
again
and
get
her
altogether
next
time
what
was
this
talk
of
life
it
was
only
just
death
the
others
did
know
she
knew
she
had
seen
it
and
been
with
it
she
had
been
down
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
it
uncomforted
her
eyes
had
been
wide
open
while
she
went
each
step
of
the
way
was
cut
into
her
memory
they
had
let
her
miss
nothing
she
knew
out
there
in
the
garden
the
rustling
leaves
looked
gay
and
the
sun
looked
cheerful
and
the
flowers
she
had
so
confidently
loved
looked
beautiful
and
kind
they
were
death
dressed
up
oh
she
was
not
to
be
taken
in
any
more
she
knew
the
very
sound
of
him
often
while
she
was
in
that
fever
she
had
heard
him
coming
across
the
yard
up
the
steps
along
the
passage
pausing
just
outside
the
door
going
back
each
time
but
only
for
a
little
while
he
would
come
again
the
horror
of
it
the
horror
of
living
with
that
waiting
the
horror
of
knowing
that
love
ended
in
this
that
new
life
was
only
more
death
fearfully
she
lay
staring
at
the
realities
that
she
alone
in
that
house
could
see
and
she
could
hear
her
heart
beating
if
only
she
have
to
hear
her
heart
beating
it
beat
in
little
irregular
beats
little
flutters
and
then
a
pause
and
then
a
sudden
oh
the
weak
weak
helplessness
nothing
to
hold
on
to
anywhere
in
all
the
world
even
the
bed
had
an
underneath
she
was
always
dropping
downwards
downwards
through
it
away
sometimes
the
nurse
came
and
stood
beside
her
and
with
a
big
wholesome
hand
smoothed
back
the
hair
from
her
absorbed
and
frowning
forehead
what
are
you
thinking
about
she
would
ask
bending
down
and
smiling
but
ingeborg
never
told
to
herr
dremmel
the
nurse
counselled
patience
he
said
he
had
been
having
it
for
ten
months
you
must
have
some
more
said
the
nurse
and
it
will
come
right
and
so
it
gradually
did
slowly
ingeborg
began
to
creep
up
the
curve
of
life
again
it
was
a
long
and
hesitating
creeping
but
there
did
come
a
time
when
there
were
definite
and
widening
gaps
in
her
vision
of
the
realities
the
first
day
she
had
meat
for
dinner
she
lost
sight
of
them
for
several
hours
the
next
day
she
had
meat
she
shut
her
mouth
the
day
after
a
feeling
of
shame
for
her
black
thoughts
crept
into
her
mind
and
stayed
there
the
day
after
that
when
she
not
only
had
meat
but
began
a
new
tonic
she
asked
for
robertlet
and
put
her
arms
round
him
all
by
herself
then
the
nurse
slipped
out
and
called
herr
dremmel
and
he
hurrying
in
and
finding
her
propped
on
pillows
holding
his
baby
and
smiling
down
at
him
just
as
he
had
pictured
she
would
went
down
once
more
on
his
knees
beside
the
bed
and
took
the
whole
group
mother
baby
and
pillows
into
his
arms
and
quite
frankly
and
openly
cried
for
joy
little
sheep
little
sheep
he
kept
on
saying
and
ingeborg
having
reached
that
point
in
convalescence
where
one
never
misses
a
chance
of
crying
at
once
cried
too
and
robertlet
beginning
to
cry
the
nurse
who
laughed
broke
up
the
group
after
that
things
grew
better
every
day
ingeborg
visibly
improved
every
hour
almost
it
was
possible
to
see
some
new
step
made
back
to
her
original
self
she
clung
to
the
nurse
who
stayed
on
long
after
the
carrying
into
the
next
room
stage
had
been
passed
and
who
did
not
leave
her
till
she
was
walking
about
quite
gaily
in
the
garden
and
beginning
to
do
the
things
with
robertlet
that
she
had
planned
she
would
she
seemed
after
the
long
months
of
ugliness
to
be
prettier
than
before
she
was
so
glad
so
grateful
to
be
back
again
and
her
gladness
lit
her
up
it
was
so
wonderful
to
be
back
in
the
bright
world
of
free
movement
to
be
presently
going
to
punt
and
presently
be
off
for
a
day
in
the
forests
to
be
able
to
arrange
to
be
in
clear
possession
of
her
time
and
her
body
the
deliciousness
of
health
the
happiness
of
being
just
normal
made
her
radiant
the
september
that
year
was
one
of
ripe
days
and
glowing
calms
neither
herr
dremmel
nor
ingeborg
had
ever
been
quite
so
happy
he
loved
her
as
warmly
as
before
their
marriage
he
found
himself
noticing
things
like
the
fine
texture
of
her
skin
and
observing
how
pretty
the
back
of
her
neck
was
and
the
way
her
hair
behaved
just
at
that
point
she
was
the
brightest
adornment
and
finish
to
a
man
house
he
said
to
himself
independently
busy
with
her
baby
and
her
housekeeping
not
worrying
him
not
having
to
be
thought
about
in
his
laboratory
when
he
wished
to
work
absorbed
in
womanly
interests
cheerful
affectionate
careful
of
her
child
it
was
delightful
to
have
her
sit
on
his
knee
again
delightful
to
hear
her
talk
the
sweet
and
sometimes
even
amusing
nonsense
with
which
her
head
seemed
full
delightful
to
see
her
sudden
solemnity
when
there
was
anything
to
be
done
for
the
personal
comfort
of
robertlet
are
we
said
ingeborg
one
evening
when
they
were
strolling
after
supper
along
the
path
through
the
all
the
old
fearlessness
and
confidence
in
life
surging
in
her
again
did
you
ever
anything
like
it
it
is
you
my
little
sun
among
sheep
said
herr
dremmel
standing
still
to
kiss
her
as
energetically
as
though
he
had
been
beneath
the
in
the
bishop
garden
it
is
all
you
and
presently
she
said
i
going
to
do
such
things
robert
such
things
first
i
going
to
be
a
proper
pastor
wife
at
last
and
turn
to
in
the
village
thoroughly
and
besides
that
i
going
to
she
stopped
and
flung
out
her
hands
with
a
familiar
gesture
well
little
hare
oh
i
do
know
but
it
fun
being
alive
is
it
i
feel
as
if
only
got
to
stretch
up
my
hands
to
all
those
stars
and
catch
as
many
of
them
as
i
want
to
and
hardly
had
the
nurse
left
and
the
household
had
returned
to
its
normal
arrangements
and
the
parlour
was
no
longer
disfigured
by
herr
dremmel
temporary
bed
and
life
was
clear
again
and
all
one
had
to
do
was
to
go
ahead
praising
the
dear
god
who
had
made
it
so
spacious
and
so
kind
than
she
began
to
have
her
second
child
part
iii
chapter
xxi
there
was
a
little
bay
about
five
minutes
paddle
down
the
lake
round
a
corner
made
by
the
jutting
out
of
reeds
you
took
your
punt
round
the
end
of
an
arm
of
reeds
and
you
found
a
small
beach
of
fine
shells
an
with
roots
overhanging
one
side
of
it
and
a
fringe
of
coarse
grass
along
the
top
on
this
you
sat
and
listened
to
the
faint
wash
of
the
water
at
your
feet
and
watched
the
sun
flashing
off
the
wings
of
innumerable
gulls
you
could
see
kökensee
and
kökensee
could
see
you
and
you
clasped
your
hands
round
your
knees
and
thought
behind
you
were
the
opposite
you
was
the
forest
it
was
a
place
of
gentleness
of
fair
afternoon
light
of
bland
colours
silvers
and
blues
and
the
pale
gold
that
reeds
take
on
in
october
ingeborg
did
not
bring
robertlet
to
this
place
she
decided
after
four
months
close
association
with
him
had
cleared
her
mind
of
misconceptions
that
he
was
too
young
she
would
not
admit
with
all
her
dreams
about
what
she
was
going
to
do
with
him
still
vivid
in
her
memory
that
she
preferred
to
be
alone
she
would
not
admit
that
she
did
anything
but
love
him
ardently
he
was
so
good
he
never
cried
nor
did
he
ever
do
what
she
supposed
must
be
the
converse
of
crying
crow
he
neither
cried
nor
crowed
he
neither
complained
nor
applauded
he
ate
with
appetite
and
he
slept
with
punctuality
he
grew
big
and
round
while
you
looked
at
him
who
would
not
esteem
him
she
did
esteem
him
more
highly
perhaps
than
she
had
ever
esteemed
anybody
but
the
ardent
love
she
had
been
told
a
mother
felt
for
her
was
a
thing
about
which
she
had
to
keep
on
saying
to
herself
of
course
he
was
a
grave
baby
and
she
did
her
best
by
cheery
gesticulations
and
encouraging
humorous
sounds
to
accustom
him
to
mirth
but
her
efforts
were
fruitless
then
one
day
as
she
was
bending
over
him
trying
to
extract
a
smile
by
an
elaborate
tickling
of
his
naked
ribs
she
caught
his
eye
and
instantly
she
jerked
back
and
stared
down
at
him
in
dismay
for
she
had
had
the
sudden
horrid
conviction
that
what
she
was
tickling
was
her
that
was
the
first
time
she
noticed
it
but
the
resemblance
was
unmistakable
was
when
you
had
once
seen
it
overwhelming
there
was
no
trace
now
that
she
tremblingly
examined
him
of
either
robert
or
herself
and
as
for
her
own
family
what
had
become
of
all
that
very
real
beauty
the
beauty
of
the
bishop
the
dazzlingness
of
judith
and
the
sweet
regularities
of
her
mother
robertlet
was
as
much
like
frau
dremmel
as
he
might
have
been
if
frau
dremmel
had
herself
produced
him
in
some
miraculous
manner
entirely
unassisted
the
resemblance
was
flagrant
it
grew
with
every
bottle
he
had
the
same
steady
eyes
he
had
the
same
prolonged
silences
his
nose
was
a
copy
his
head
hairless
was
more
like
frau
dremmel
thought
ingeborg
than
frau
dremmel
could
ever
have
possibly
been
and
if
ever
his
hair
grew
she
said
to
herself
gazing
at
him
it
would
undoubtedly
do
it
from
the
beginning
in
a
knob
gradually
as
the
days
passed
and
the
likeness
appeared
more
and
more
she
came
when
she
tubbed
him
and
powdered
his
many
creases
to
have
a
sensation
of
infinite
indiscretion
and
she
announced
to
herr
dremmel
who
did
not
understand
that
robertlet
first
word
would
certainly
be
why
asked
herr
dremmel
from
the
other
side
of
a
wall
of
thinking
you
see
if
it
is
nodded
ingeborg
with
a
perturbed
face
but
robertlet
first
word
and
for
a
long
time
his
only
one
was
his
next
which
did
not
join
it
till
some
months
later
was
which
is
the
german
for
and
which
he
said
whenever
anybody
arrived
he
is
very
thought
ingeborg
and
remembered
with
a
chill
that
not
once
since
her
marriage
had
her
invited
her
to
her
house
in
meuk
but
she
made
excuses
for
him
immediately
everybody
she
said
to
herself
feels
a
little
stiff
at
to
this
beautiful
corner
of
the
lake
for
it
was
very
beautiful
those
delicate
autumn
afternoons
she
went
during
robertlet
dinner
sleep
to
do
what
she
called
think
things
out
and
she
sat
on
the
little
shells
with
her
hands
round
her
knees
staring
across
the
quiet
water
at
the
line
of
pale
reeds
along
the
other
shore
doing
it
presently
however
she
perceived
that
her
thinking
was
more
a
general
discomfort
of
the
mind
punctuated
irregularly
by
flashes
than
anything
that
could
honestly
be
called
clear
things
would
not
be
thought
out
at
least
they
would
not
be
thought
out
by
her
and
she
was
feeling
sick
again
and
how
she
asked
herself
can
people
who
are
busy
being
sick
be
anything
sick
besides
things
would
bear
thinking
out
her
eyes
grew
bright
with
fear
when
one
of
those
flashes
lit
up
what
was
once
more
ahead
of
her
it
was
like
a
scarlet
spear
of
terror
suddenly
leaping
at
her
heart
no
thought
ingeborg
turning
quickly
away
all
cold
and
trembling
better
not
think
better
just
sit
in
the
sun
and
wonder
what
robertlet
would
look
like
later
on
if
he
persisted
in
being
exactly
like
frau
dremmel
and
yet
in
due
season
had
to
go
into
trousers
and
what
would
happen
if
the
next
one
were
like
frau
dremmel
too
and
whether
she
would
presently
be
teaching
a
row
of
little
its
infant
hymns
the
thought
of
frau
dremmel
become
plural
diminished
into
socks
and
pinafores
standing
neatly
at
her
knee
being
taught
to
lisp
in
numbers
seized
her
with
laughter
she
laughed
and
laughed
and
only
stopped
when
she
discovered
that
what
she
was
really
doing
was
crying
perhaps
it
talking
i
want
more
than
thinking
she
said
to
herr
dremmel
at
last
returning
from
one
of
these
barren
expeditions
in
search
of
understanding
she
said
it
a
little
timidly
for
she
was
already
less
to
him
than
she
had
been
in
that
brief
interval
of
health
and
knew
that
with
every
month
she
would
be
less
and
less
it
was
odd
how
sure
of
him
she
was
when
she
was
not
going
to
have
a
baby
of
what
an
easy
confidence
in
his
love
and
how
he
seemed
to
slip
away
from
her
when
she
was
already
though
she
had
only
just
begun
he
was
miles
away
from
the
loving
mood
in
which
he
folded
her
in
his
arms
and
called
her
his
little
sheep
herr
dremmel
who
was
supping
and
was
not
in
possession
of
the
context
recommended
thinking
he
added
after
a
pause
that
only
a
woman
would
have
suggested
a
distinction
ingeborg
did
not
make
the
obvious
reply
but
said
she
thought
if
she
might
talk
to
somebody
to
robert
for
instance
and
with
her
hand
in
his
rather
in
his
while
she
talked
so
that
she
might
feel
safe
feel
not
quite
so
loose
and
unheld
together
in
an
enormous
awful
world
herr
dremmel
looked
at
his
watch
and
said
perhaps
he
would
have
time
to
hold
her
hand
next
week
a
few
days
later
she
said
equally
without
supplying
him
with
the
context
it
blessing
disguising
itself
that
what
it
is
herr
dremmel
who
again
was
supping
said
nothing
preferring
to
wait
blessing
only
pretending
to
be
cruelty
not
really
cruelty
at
all
herr
dremmel
still
preferred
to
wait
i
thought
at
first
it
was
cruelty
she
said
but
now
i
think
perhaps
perhaps
it
blessing
what
did
you
think
was
cruelty
ingeborg
asked
herr
dremmel
who
disliked
the
repetition
of
such
a
word
having
this
next
baby
so
quickly
without
time
to
forget
her
eyes
grew
bright
cruelty
ingeborg
herr
dremmel
said
one
did
not
when
one
was
a
pastor
wife
call
providence
names
that
what
i
saying
she
said
i
thought
at
first
it
was
cruel
but
now
i
see
it
really
ever
so
much
better
not
to
waste
time
between
one
children
and
then
be
well
for
the
rest
of
one
days
it
it
will
make
the
contrast
afterwards
when
one
has
done
with
pain
so
splendid
she
looked
at
him
and
pressed
her
hands
together
vivid
recollections
lit
her
eyes
but
i
give
up
these
splendid
contrasts
very
she
whispered
her
face
gone
suddenly
herr
dremmel
said
that
family
life
had
always
been
praised
not
only
for
its
beauty
but
for
its
necessity
as
the
foundation
of
the
state
you
told
me
said
ingeborg
who
had
a
trick
which
good
men
sometimes
found
irritating
of
remembering
everything
they
had
ever
said
the
foundation
of
the
state
was
manure
herr
dremmel
said
so
it
was
and
so
was
family
life
he
would
not
he
informed
her
quibble
over
terms
what
he
wished
to
make
clear
was
that
there
could
not
be
family
life
without
a
family
to
have
it
in
and
do
you
call
you
and
me
and
robertlet
a
family
she
asked
one
child
said
herr
dremmel
you
would
limit
the
family
to
one
child
that
is
a
highly
unchristian
line
of
conduct
but
the
christian
lines
of
conduct
seem
to
so
murmured
ingeborg
oh
i
know
there
have
to
be
brothers
and
sisters
she
added
quickly
before
he
could
speak
and
it
best
to
get
it
over
and
have
done
with
it
it
only
when
i
it
only
sometimes
that
i
think
robertlet
would
have
been
enough
family
till
till
i
had
time
to
forget
again
the
light
of
terror
came
into
her
eyes
she
knew
it
was
there
she
looked
down
at
her
plate
to
hide
it
twice
after
that
she
came
back
from
her
thinking
down
by
the
lake
and
attempted
to
talk
to
him
about
questions
of
life
and
death
herr
dremmel
was
bored
by
questions
of
life
and
death
unless
they
were
his
own
ones
he
met
them
however
patiently
she
arrived
panting
for
it
was
uphill
back
to
the
house
desperately
needing
her
vision
rubbed
a
little
clearer
against
his
so
that
she
might
reach
out
to
reassurance
and
courage
and
he
took
on
an
air
of
patience
almost
before
she
had
begun
in
the
presence
of
that
premature
resignation
she
faltered
off
into
silence
also
what
she
had
wanted
to
say
got
tangled
into
the
silliest
sentences
she
heard
them
being
silly
as
they
came
out
no
wonder
he
looked
resigned
she
could
have
wept
with
chagrin
at
her
inarticulateness
her
want
of
real
education
her
incapacity
for
getting
her
thoughts
torn
away
from
their
confusion
and
safely
landed
into
speech
and
there
stood
robert
waiting
with
that
air
of
patience
but
how
odd
it
was
the
difference
between
his
talk
before
she
was
going
to
have
a
baby
and
his
silence
surely
resigned
silence
when
she
was
she
wished
she
knew
more
about
husbands
she
wished
that
during
the
years
at
home
instead
of
writing
all
those
diocesan
letters
she
had
ripely
reflected
on
the
conjugalities
as
the
days
went
by
her
need
of
somebody
to
talk
to
her
dread
of
being
alone
with
her
imagination
and
its
flashes
became
altogether
intolerable
she
went
at
last
driven
by
panic
to
the
village
mothers
asking
anxious
questions
about
how
they
had
felt
how
they
had
managed
going
round
on
days
when
she
was
better
to
the
cottages
where
families
were
longest
but
nothing
came
of
this
the
attitude
everywhere
was
a
dull
acceptance
a
shrug
of
the
shoulder
a
tiredness
then
she
sought
out
the
postman
wife
who
looked
particularly
motherly
and
bright
and
found
that
she
was
childless
then
she
met
the
forester
one
day
in
the
woods
and
was
so
far
gone
in
need
that
she
almost
began
to
ask
him
her
anxious
questions
for
he
looked
more
motherly
even
than
the
postman
wife
then
she
thought
of
baroness
glambeck
who
before
robertlet
birth
had
been
helpful
in
practical
ways
would
she
not
be
helpful
now
in
these
spiritual
stresses
and
she
walked
over
there
with
difficulty
one
afternoon
in
november
through
the
deep
wet
sand
approaching
her
as
one
naked
soul
delivered
by
its
urgencies
from
the
web
of
reticence
and
convention
approaches
another
but
nothing
could
be
less
naked
that
day
than
the
baroness
soul
it
was
dressed
even
to
gloves
and
a
bonnet
it
had
no
urgencies
and
hildebrand
von
glambeck
was
there
the
only
son
in
the
family
of
six
the
member
of
it
who
had
married
most
money
and
his
mother
was
proudly
pouring
out
coffee
for
him
in
festal
silk
it
was
entirely
contrary
to
custom
for
one
pastor
wife
to
walk
in
without
having
first
inquired
whether
her
visit
would
be
acceptable
and
when
the
baroness
perceived
the
sandy
and
disordered
figure
coming
towards
her
down
the
long
room
she
was
not
only
annoyed
but
dismayed
she
had
not
seen
this
dearest
of
her
children
for
six
months
and
it
was
the
first
opportunity
she
had
had
since
his
arrival
the
evening
before
of
being
alone
with
him
for
he
had
brought
a
friend
with
him
from
berlin
and
not
till
after
luncheon
had
the
friend
who
painted
been
satisfactorily
disposed
of
out
of
doors
in
the
park
where
he
announced
his
intention
of
staying
as
long
as
the
sun
stayed
on
a
certain
she
wanted
to
ask
her
boy
questions
she
had
sent
the
baron
out
riding
round
his
farms
so
as
to
be
able
to
ask
questions
she
wanted
to
know
about
his
life
in
berlin
to
her
so
remote
and
so
full
of
drawbacks
that
yet
glittered
a
high
dangerous
less
truly
aristocratic
life
than
this
of
lofty
stagnation
in
god
provinces
but
shone
upon
after
all
by
the
presence
of
her
emperor
and
king
in
her
heart
she
believed
that
the
almighty
had
also
some
years
ago
probably
about
the
time
of
her
marriage
when
she
too
retired
into
them
withdrawn
into
the
provinces
and
there
particularly
presided
over
those
best
of
the
fatherland
nobles
who
stayed
with
a
pure
persistency
in
the
places
where
they
happened
to
have
been
born
on
his
departure
for
the
country
the
baroness
decided
he
had
handed
over
berlin
and
potsdam
to
the
care
of
the
first
of
his
children
her
emperor
and
king
and
so
it
was
that
the
provinces
were
higher
and
more
truly
aristocratic
than
berlin
and
potsdam
and
so
it
was
that
berlin
and
potsdam
nevertheless
ran
them
very
close
and
now
just
as
she
had
so
cleverly
contrived
this
hour
with
hildebrand
for
getting
at
all
those
intimate
details
of
his
life
that
a
mother
loves
but
does
not
care
to
talk
about
before
her
husband
this
hour
for
hearing
about
his
children
his
meals
his
money
his
dear
success
in
society
and
appearances
thanks
to
her
having
married
into
the
nobility
at
court
his
own
health
his
indigestion
that
ancient
tormentor
of
his
peace
and
whether
he
had
seen
or
heard
anything
of
poor
emmi
his
eldest
sister
who
had
miserably
married
six
thousand
marks
a
year
and
lived
impossibly
at
spandau
and
could
not
be
got
to
admit
she
did
not
like
it
just
as
she
was
going
to
be
satisfied
on
all
these
points
came
that
eccentric
and
pushing
frau
pastor
and
spoilt
it
all
also
hildebrand
was
in
the
very
middle
of
one
of
those
sad
stories
of
scandal
that
one
wishes
one
had
not
to
listen
to
but
naturally
wants
to
hear
the
end
of
so
great
was
the
baroness
disappointment
that
she
found
it
impossible
to
stop
herself
from
affecting
inability
to
recognise
the
frau
pastor
till
she
was
actually
touching
the
coffee
table
ah
she
then
said
not
getting
up
but
slowly
putting
out
her
hand
to
take
the
hand
that
was
being
offered
and
staring
as
though
she
were
trying
to
remember
where
and
when
she
had
seen
her
before
ah
frau
pastor
this
is
indeed
an
honour
present
me
mamma
said
hildebrand
who
had
got
on
to
his
feet
the
instant
ingeborg
appeared
in
the
doorway
the
ceremony
performed
he
sank
again
into
his
chair
and
did
nothing
more
at
all
being
waited
on
by
his
mother
and
leaving
it
to
her
to
see
that
the
visitor
was
given
cream
and
sugar
and
cake
until
the
moment
arrived
when
ingeborg
made
abundantly
and
elaborately
aware
that
she
was
interrupting
prepared
to
go
away
again
then
once
more
he
started
up
alert
and
with
his
heels
together
well
and
what
did
her
husband
do
asked
the
baroness
turning
again
to
hildebrand
as
soon
as
ingeborg
had
been
got
quiet
on
a
chair
with
coffee
determined
to
hear
the
end
of
the
story
my
dear
mother
said
hildebrand
shrugging
his
shoulders
up
to
his
ears
what
could
he
do
he
shot
her
of
course
naturally
said
the
baroness
nodding
approval
was
she
killed
no
badly
wounded
but
it
was
enough
his
honour
was
avenged
and
she
will
not
said
the
baroness
grimly
begin
these
tricks
again
ingeborg
roused
herself
with
an
effort
to
say
something
she
was
extraordinarily
disappointed
and
unnerved
by
not
finding
the
baroness
alone
why
did
he
shoot
her
she
asked
it
seemed
to
her
in
her
tiredness
so
very
energetic
of
him
to
have
shot
her
the
baroness
turned
a
cold
eye
on
her
because
frau
pastor
she
said
she
was
his
sinning
wife
oh
said
ingeborg
and
added
an
inquiry
in
a
nervous
desire
to
make
for
a
brief
space
agreeable
small
talk
before
going
away
again
whether
in
germany
they
always
shot
each
other
when
they
sinned
not
each
other
said
the
baroness
severely
at
least
not
if
it
is
a
husband
and
his
wife
he
alone
shoots
oh
said
ingeborg
considering
this
she
was
sitting
inertly
on
her
chair
holding
her
cup
of
coffee
slanting
too
much
dejected
to
drink
it
and
then
does
that
make
her
love
him
again
she
asked
in
her
small
tired
voice
the
baroness
did
not
answer
only
blood
said
hildebrand
can
wipe
out
a
husband
dishonour
how
said
ingeborg
dejectedly
life
seemed
all
blood
she
drooped
over
her
cup
thinking
of
the
cruelty
with
which
things
were
apparently
packed
the
baroness
and
hildebrand
after
a
pregnant
silence
turned
from
her
and
began
to
talk
of
somebody
they
called
poor
emmi
ingeborg
sat
alone
with
her
cup
wondering
how
she
could
get
away
before
she
began
to
cry
dreadful
how
easily
she
cried
now
she
must
buy
some
more
handkerchiefs
they
seemed
lately
to
be
always
at
the
she
roused
herself
again
she
really
must
say
something
as
her
way
was
when
confused
and
unnerved
she
caught
at
the
first
thing
she
found
tumbling
about
in
her
mind
why
was
emmi
poor
she
asked
in
her
small
tired
voice
there
was
another
pregnant
silence
to
shorten
it
ingeborg
asked
whether
emmi
was
the
wife
who
had
been
shot
the
sinning
one
she
explained
as
nobody
answered
the
silence
became
awful
she
looked
up
startled
by
it
from
the
expression
on
their
faces
and
the
general
feel
of
things
she
thought
that
perhaps
they
would
mind
if
she
went
home
now
she
got
up
dropping
the
spoon
out
of
her
saucer
i
think
i
must
be
going
she
said
it
a
long
way
home
it
seems
hardly
worth
while
to
have
come
said
the
baroness
with
extraordinary
chill
to
which
ingeborg
absorbed
in
the
failure
of
her
effort
to
find
help
and
comfort
answered
droopingly
no
outside
the
sun
had
just
dropped
behind
the
forest
line
and
she
would
have
to
walk
fast
if
she
wanted
to
be
home
before
dark
the
mist
was
already
rising
over
the
meadows
beyond
the
trees
of
the
garden
and
beginning
to
mix
with
the
rose
and
lilac
of
the
sky
the
sandy
avenue
she
had
come
along
on
that
hot
july
day
when
first
she
discovered
glambeck
lay
at
her
feet
in
the
still
beauty
of
the
last
of
its
dresses
for
the
year
very
delicate
very
transparent
already
the
leaves
of
the
beeches
almost
all
on
the
ground
making
of
the
road
a
ribbon
of
light
a
november
smell
of
dampness
and
of
peat
smoke
from
cottage
chimneys
filled
the
air
there
was
a
brooding
peace
over
the
world
as
though
in
every
house
in
every
family
brotherly
love
must
needs
in
such
gentleness
continue
she
went
carefully
down
the
steps
for
her
body
was
already
growing
cumbersome
and
along
the
golden
way
of
the
avenue
she
tried
not
to
cry
not
to
smudge
the
beautiful
evening
with
her
own
disappointments
how
foolish
she
had
been
to
suppose
that
because
she
wanted
to
talk
baroness
glambeck
would
want
to
listen
moods
did
not
coincide
so
conveniently
she
walked
along
diligently
stopping
any
stray
tear
with
her
handkerchief
before
it
could
disgrace
her
by
coming
out
on
to
her
cheeks
presently
baroness
glambeck
might
passionately
want
to
listen
it
was
quite
conceivable
and
she
herself
would
not
in
the
least
want
to
talk
how
foolish
it
all
was
one
had
to
stand
on
one
own
feet
it
was
no
good
going
about
calling
out
for
help
it
was
less
than
no
good
crying
some
day
if
she
continued
intrepidly
in
this
career
of
maternity
which
seemed
to
be
marked
out
for
her
she
too
would
be
happily
pouring
out
coffee
for
a
and
successful
all
her
impatiences
and
pangs
long
since
forgotten
you
clearly
have
a
to
love
and
be
proud
of
if
you
had
begun
him
in
time
he
had
at
some
period
or
other
to
be
begun
and
he
had
to
be
begun
in
time
else
one
might
easily
be
too
old
for
acute
appreciation
she
went
as
quickly
as
she
could
down
the
avenue
thinking
on
large
valiant
lines
and
underneath
her
thinking
feeling
altogether
forsaken
it
must
be
nice
a
warm
thing
to
live
where
one
friends
and
relatives
were
within
reach
where
one
could
for
instance
when
one
felt
extra
lonely
go
and
have
tea
with
one
mother
a
man
carrying
what
seemed
to
be
a
great
deal
of
something
indefinite
was
coming
down
the
avenue
towards
her
she
looked
at
him
vaguely
absorbed
in
her
thoughts
it
was
not
the
baron
and
except
for
him
she
knew
nobody
she
was
within
a
yard
or
two
of
him
when
a
quantity
of
sheets
of
paper
long
slender
brushes
odd
articles
she
did
not
recognise
suddenly
seemed
to
burst
out
from
his
person
and
scatter
themselves
over
the
on
the
ground
oh
damn
said
the
man
making
efforts
to
catch
them
ingeborg
always
eager
to
help
began
clumsily
to
pick
up
those
nearest
her
he
had
a
on
one
arm
and
what
appeared
to
be
a
mackintosh
and
was
altogether
greatly
hampered
look
here
do
do
that
he
exclaimed
struggling
with
these
things
which
also
apparently
were
slipping
from
him
oh
but
how
lovely
said
ingeborg
holding
one
of
the
sheets
of
paper
she
had
picked
up
at
arm
length
and
staring
with
her
red
eyes
at
a
on
it
a
celestial
surely
aflame
with
so
great
a
glory
of
light
that
it
could
not
possibly
be
earthly
but
only
the
sort
of
tree
they
have
in
heaven
close
it
was
just
splashes
of
colour
you
had
to
hold
it
away
from
you
to
see
it
at
all
she
blew
away
some
grains
of
sand
that
were
on
it
and
then
held
it
once
more
as
far
from
her
as
her
arm
would
go
oh
but
how
lovely
she
said
again
look
it
of
course
it
shines
that
was
what
it
was
doing
he
said
coming
and
looking
at
the
sketch
over
her
shoulder
a
minute
his
hands
full
of
the
things
he
had
collected
from
the
ground
they
said
they
send
a
servant
for
all
this
and
they
did
i
hate
carrying
things
i
carry
some
said
ingeborg
nonsense
and
you
not
going
there
i
been
but
i
go
back
as
far
as
the
steps
if
you
like
nonsense
i
leave
them
at
the
foot
of
this
tree
he
see
them
all
right
not
this
you
must
leave
this
she
said
still
gazing
at
the
sketch
no
i
take
that
and
i
coming
with
you
a
little
way
because
i
ca
conceive
where
you
can
be
going
to
at
this
time
of
the
day
that
is
to
the
glambecks
and
i
curious
also
because
it
so
funny
of
you
to
be
english
i
think
it
much
funnier
of
you
said
ingeborg
picking
up
a
pencil
out
of
a
rut
in
the
sand
and
adding
it
to
the
pile
he
was
making
against
the
trunk
of
the
nearest
tree
and
i
only
going
home
home
he
undid
the
pile
and
began
again
he
had
got
it
wrong
the
of
course
must
be
the
foundation
then
the
smaller
things
then
neatly
folded
and
tucking
them
all
in
the
mackintosh
she
must
be
an
english
governess
or
superior
nurse
on
a
neighbouring
estate
since
she
talked
of
home
if
so
he
did
not
want
to
go
with
her
nothing
he
could
think
of
seemed
to
him
quite
so
tiresome
as
an
english
governess
or
superior
nurse
he
finished
tucking
in
the
mackintosh
and
turned
round
and
took
the
sketch
from
her
he
was
she
perceived
a
long
man
with
a
short
red
beard
she
was
he
perceived
somebody
in
a
badly
fitting
tweed
coat
and
skirt
a
person
with
a
used
sort
of
nose
and
weak
eyes
now
then
he
said
i
go
with
you
anyhow
to
the
end
of
the
avenue
where
is
home
kökensee
said
ingeborg
trotting
to
keep
up
with
him
it
the
next
village
i
the
pastor
wife
ingram
for
it
was
that
celebrated
artist
then
at
already
known
all
over
europe
as
more
especially
and
letting
alone
his
small
exquisite
things
a
surprising
indeed
a
disturbingly
surprising
painter
of
portraits
glanced
down
at
her
and
stepped
out
more
vigorously
that
an
amusing
thing
to
be
he
said
and
quite
new
it
is
very
new
i
been
it
eighteen
months
why
do
you
think
amusing
it
different
from
anything
else
nobody
was
ever
a
pastor
wife
in
what
did
you
call
it
before
kökensee
kökensee
kökensee
i
like
that
you
unique
to
live
in
kökensee
nobody
else
has
achieved
that
it
was
very
difficult
i
just
stayed
passive
and
was
brought
and
they
did
mind
who
did
your
people
your
father
and
mother
or
are
you
melchisedec
and
never
had
any
why
should
they
mind
coming
so
far
it
rather
the
end
of
the
world
you
right
up
against
the
edge
of
russia
i
wanted
to
of
course
i
did
suppose
you
were
dragged
across
europe
by
your
hair
to
kökensee
i
come
all
the
way
with
you
i
want
to
see
kökensee
do
walk
so
fast
then
said
ingeborg
panting
i
walk
like
that
he
looked
at
her
as
he
went
slower
is
that
the
effect
of
kökensee
he
said
why
ca
you
walk
like
that
you
only
a
girl
i
not
a
girl
at
all
i
a
wife
i
a
mother
i
everything
really
now
except
a
and
a
grandmother
that
all
there
still
left
to
be
i
think
they
rather
dull
things
both
of
them
you
wo
think
so
when
you
got
there
that
the
dreadfullest
part
of
it
it
a
kindly
trick
time
plays
on
us
are
you
a
real
pastor
wife
who
goes
about
her
parish
being
an
example
i
have
yet
but
i
going
to
what
not
begun
in
eighteen
months
but
what
do
you
do
then
all
day
long
first
i
cook
and
then
i
do
cook
they
were
out
in
the
open
on
the
bit
of
road
that
passed
between
meadows
ingram
stopped
and
looked
at
something
over
to
the
left
with
sudden
absorbed
attention
she
followed
his
eyes
but
did
not
see
much
a
wisp
of
mist
along
the
grass
the
top
twigs
of
a
willow
emerging
from
it
and
above
it
the
faint
sky
he
said
nothing
and
presently
went
on
walking
faster
than
ever
go
a
little
slower
begged
ingeborg
her
heart
thumping
with
effort
i
think
you
know
said
ingram
suiting
himself
to
her
you
should
be
able
to
walk
better
than
that
yes
said
ingeborg
i
suppose
that
the
danger
of
places
like
kökensee
one
lets
oneself
get
slack
yes
said
ingeborg
you
must
you
know
imagine
losing
one
lines
just
think
of
the
horrible
indefinite
lines
of
a
fat
woman
yes
said
ingeborg
do
you
paint
much
she
asked
unable
to
endure
this
turn
of
the
conversation
he
looked
at
her
and
laughed
a
good
deal
he
said
then
he
added
i
ingram
is
that
your
name
mine
dremmel
ingram
he
said
looking
at
her
it
was
inconceivable
she
should
not
know
dremmel
she
said
as
though
it
were
a
game
he
was
silent
a
moment
then
he
stopped
with
a
jerk
i
do
think
come
any
farther
he
said
the
glambecks
will
be
wondering
what
has
become
of
me
glambeck
brought
me
down
for
a
couple
of
nights
and
i
ca
be
not
there
all
the
time
but
you
wanted
to
see
kökensee
does
anybody
ever
read
in
kökensee
read
papers
books
reviews
criticisms
what
the
world
doing
in
all
the
million
places
that
are
kökensee
who
everybody
is
what
being
thought
and
created
he
had
an
oddly
nettled
look
robert
takes
in
the
norddeutscheallgemeinezeitung
and
i
been
reading
kipling
kipling
well
but
is
kipling
why
till
i
married
i
had
only
the
litany
what
on
earth
for
that
and
psalms
and
things
i
felt
very
on
the
litany
i
can
imagine
it
i
lose
no
more
time
then
in
furnishing
my
emptiness
oh
do
go
wait
a
moment
it
such
ages
since
i
furnishing
it
how
what
ought
i
read
read
read
everything
you
can
lay
your
hands
on
but
there
anything
to
lay
hands
on
my
dear
lady
have
you
postcards
write
to
london
and
order
the
reviews
to
be
sent
out
to
you
get
some
notion
of
people
and
ideas
oh
but
wo
you
really
come
and
look
at
kökensee
it
a
dark
place
i
afraid
what
i
see
there
would
be
nothing
there
be
more
light
i
going
south
again
with
glambeck
i
only
came
for
a
day
i
was
curious
about
provincial
german
interiors
oh
but
do
my
advice
is
very
sound
you
know
one
ca
shut
one
eyes
and
just
sleep
while
the
procession
of
men
and
women
who
are
making
the
world
goes
past
one
unless
his
eyes
glanced
over
the
want
of
trimness
of
her
figure
the
untidy
way
her
loose
coat
was
fastened
unless
one
does
mind
running
to
seed
but
i
mind
cried
ingeborg
it
the
last
thing
i
want
to
run
to
then
do
he
took
off
his
hat
and
was
already
several
steps
away
from
her
by
the
time
it
was
on
his
head
again
then
he
turned
round
and
called
out
to
the
dejected
little
figure
standing
where
he
had
left
it
in
the
sandy
road
with
the
grey
curtain
of
mist
blurring
it
it
really
is
duty
to
know
at
least
something
of
what
being
done
in
the
world
and
he
jerked
away
into
the
dusk
towards
glambeck
she
stood
a
long
while
looking
at
the
place
where
the
gloom
had
blotted
him
out
wonderful
to
have
met
somebody
who
really
talked
to
one
who
actually
told
one
what
to
do
she
went
home
making
impulsive
resolutions
suddenly
brave
again
her
chin
in
the
air
ill
or
not
ill
she
was
not
going
to
be
beaten
she
was
not
going
to
wait
another
day
before
beginning
to
fill
her
stupid
mind
it
was
monstrous
she
should
be
so
ignorant
so
uneducated
what
was
she
made
of
then
what
poor
cheap
stuff
that
she
could
think
of
nothing
better
than
to
cry
because
she
did
not
feel
as
well
as
she
used
to
were
there
heaps
of
things
to
do
even
when
one
was
ill
had
she
not
herself
heard
of
sick
people
whose
minds
triumphed
so
entirely
over
their
prostrate
flesh
that
from
really
quite
perpetual
beds
they
shed
brightness
on
whole
parishes
she
wrote
that
night
to
mudie
demanding
catalogues
of
him
almost
with
fierceness
and
ordered
as
a
beginning
the
and
both
of
which
at
redchester
had
been
mentioned
in
her
presence
by
prebendaries
when
they
arrived
she
read
them
laboriously
from
cover
to
cover
and
then
ordered
all
the
monthly
reviews
they
advertised
she
subscribed
at
once
to
the
and
to
a
weekly
paper
called
the
because
it
was
alluded
to
in
one
of
the
reviews
she
showered
postcards
on
mudie
for
whatever
books
she
read
about
she
immediately
bought
deciding
that
that
was
as
good
a
way
of
starting
as
any
other
and
she
had
not
been
reading
papers
a
week
before
she
came
across
edward
ingram
name
a
great
light
dawned
on
her
she
said
with
a
little
catch
of
the
breath
turning
hot
and
became
aware
that
she
had
just
been
having
the
most
recognisably
interesting
encounter
of
her
life
chapter
xxii
in
seven
years
ingeborg
had
six
children
she
completely
realised
during
that
period
the
psalmist
ideal
of
a
reward
for
a
good
man
and
was
altogether
the
fruitful
vine
about
the
walls
of
his
house
she
was
uninterruptedly
fruitful
she
rambled
richly
she
saw
herself
at
first
with
an
astonished
chagrin
and
afterwards
with
resignation
swarming
up
to
the
eaves
of
her
little
home
pauseless
gapless
luxuriantly
threatening
choke
the
very
chimneys
at
the
beginning
she
deplored
this
uninterrupted
abundance
for
she
could
not
but
see
that
beneath
it
the
family
roof
grew
a
little
rotten
and
sometimes
though
she
made
feeble
efforts
to
keep
it
out
a
rather
dismal
rain
of
discomfort
soaked
in
and
dimmed
the
brightness
of
things
good
servants
would
not
come
to
such
a
teeming
household
the
children
that
were
there
suffered
because
of
the
children
that
were
soon
going
to
be
there
it
was
a
pity
she
thought
that
when
one
produced
a
new
child
one
could
not
simultaneously
produce
a
new
mother
for
it
so
that
it
should
be
as
well
looked
after
as
first
child
had
been
she
could
mend
their
stockings
because
that
could
be
done
lying
on
a
sofa
but
she
was
never
sure
about
anything
else
that
concerned
them
and
there
were
so
many
things
such
endless
vital
things
to
be
seen
to
if
babies
were
to
flourish
and
when
the
first
ones
grew
bigger
and
she
might
have
begun
those
intimate
expeditions
and
communions
with
them
she
used
to
plan
she
found
that
too
was
impossible
for
she
was
so
deeply
engaged
in
providing
them
with
more
brothers
and
sisters
that
she
was
unable
to
move
the
days
between
her
first
and
second
child
were
the
best
she
was
still
strong
enough
to
tub
robertlet
every
night
and
prepare
his
food
and
keep
a
watchful
eye
on
him
most
of
the
time
also
he
was
only
one
and
easy
to
deal
with
and
he
was
so
exact
and
punctual
in
his
ways
that
he
seemed
like
a
clock
you
wound
up
at
regular
intervals
and
knew
would
then
go
on
by
itself
and
his
clothes
naturally
were
all
new
and
needed
little
mending
and
she
still
had
ilse
who
did
not
marry
till
a
year
later
and
she
had
persuaded
herself
for
one
must
needs
persuade
oneself
of
something
that
after
this
next
baby
there
would
be
a
pause
this
persuasion
and
the
few
admonishments
edward
ingram
had
thrown
at
her
that
afternoon
helped
her
extraordinarily
so
easily
could
she
be
stirred
to
courage
and
enthusiasm
that
she
was
able
to
forget
most
of
her
fears
and
discomforts
in
the
new
business
of
training
her
mind
to
triumph
over
her
body
and
she
got
through
a
surprising
quantity
of
mixed
reading
that
winter
and
spring
and
when
at
last
in
the
following
may
her
hour
had
come
she
marched
off
almost
recklessly
with
her
two
plaits
already
hanging
down
her
back
and
her
head
held
high
and
her
eyes
wide
and
shining
to
the
fatal
bedroom
where
death
she
supposed
but
refused
to
care
sat
waiting
to
see
if
he
could
not
get
her
this
time
so
filled
was
she
with
the
spirit
she
had
been
cultivating
for
six
months
of
proud
determination
not
to
be
beaten
she
was
however
beaten
it
was
the
absence
of
pauses
that
beat
her
she
came
to
be
as
the
german
phrase
put
it
in
a
continual
condition
of
being
blest
she
came
to
be
also
continually
more
bloodless
gradually
sinking
away
more
and
more
from
energy
as
one
child
after
the
other
sapped
her
up
she
left
off
reading
dropping
the
more
difficult
things
first
the
went
almost
at
once
soon
the

at
languidly
and
not
opened
the
gave
her
an
earache
presently
she
was
too
far
gone
even
for
the
the
lasted
longest
but
a
growing
distaste
for
its
tone
caused
it
finally
to
be
abandoned
for
she
was
becoming
definitely
religious
she
was
ceasing
to
criticise
or
to
ask
why
she
would
sit
for
hours
contemplating
the
beauty
of
acquiescence
it
gave
her
a
boneless
satisfaction
the
more
anæmic
she
grew
the
easier
religion
seemed
to
be
it
was
much
the
least
difficult
thing
to
be
passive
to
yield
not
to
think
not
to
decide
never
to
want
explanations
and
everybody
praised
her
how
nice
that
was
baroness
glambeck
approved
frau
dosch
approved
loudly
the
elder
frau
dremmel
came
out
each
year
twice
and
silently
approved
of
a
mother
whose
offspring
was
so
strikingly
like
herself
while
as
for
kökensee
it
regarded
her
with
the
respect
due
to
a
person
becoming
proverbial
it
is
true
robert
seemed
to
love
her
rather
less
than
more
in
spite
of
her
obviously
deserving
to
be
loved
more
than
ever
now
that
she
was
at
one
with
him
about
providence
yet
it
was
hardly
fair
to
say
that
either
for
nobody
could
be
kinder
than
he
was
when
he
was
not
busy
he
was
busy
from
morning
to
night
how
nice
that
was
she
thought
her
hands
folded
she
had
always
thought
it
nice
to
be
busy
of
her
six
children
robertlet
flourished
and
so
did
the
sister
who
came
after
him
the
next
two
died
one
doing
it
boldly
of
mumps
a
thing
that
had
never
been
achieved
before
and
greatly
interested
the
doctor
who
predicted
a
memorable
future
for
him
if
he
had
been
going
to
have
one
and
the
other
more
explicably
by
falling
out
of
the
punt
when
his
very
existence
depended
on
his
keeping
in
it
then
they
took
to
being
born
dead
two
of
them
in
succession
did
this
and
it
was
after
the
second
had
done
it
that
ingeborg
reached
her
lowest
ebb
of
vitality
and
could
hardly
be
got
to
say
a
sentence
that
did
not
include
heaven
when
she
had
been
up
and
dressed
two
months
and
still
lay
about
on
sofas
being
religious
herr
dremmel
who
was
patient
but
slowly
becoming
conscious
that
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
about
his
parlour
on
his
coming
into
it
with
the
innocent
briskness
of
a
good
man
to
his
supper
thought
perhaps
the
meuk
doctor
who
by
now
was
a
familiar
feature
in
his
life
had
better
come
over
and
advise
and
so
it
was
that
ingeborg
went
to
zoppot
that
bracing
and
beautiful
seaside
resort
near
danzig
leaving
her
home
for
the
first
time
since
her
marriage
going
indeed
with
as
much
unwillingness
as
so
a
person
could
possess
but
sent
off
regardless
of
her
moist
opposition
by
the
doctor
who
would
not
even
allow
her
to
take
robertlet
and
ditti
with
her
she
went
in
the
care
of
the
nurse
who
had
helped
her
after
birth
and
she
was
to
stay
there
all
june
and
all
july
and
all
august
and
september
as
well
if
necessary
but
what
will
they
do
without
me
she
kept
on
feebly
asking
and
my
duties
how
can
i
leave
everything
tears
poured
down
her
face
at
her
departure
she
gave
keepsakes
to
both
the
servants
she
sent
for
the
sexton
with
whom
she
had
latterly
grown
friendly
and
tried
to
speak
but
could
not
she
folded
the
impassive
robertlet
and
ditti
to
her
heart
so
many
times
that
they
were
stirred
to
something
almost
approaching
activity
and
resistance
your
prayers
you
wo
forget
what
mummy
taught
you
she
wept
as
though
she
were
taking
leave
of
them
for
ever
dear
robert
she
sobbed
clinging
to
him
with
her
cheek
against
his
on
the
platform
at
meuk
where
he
saw
her
off
do
forgive
me
if
i
been
a
bad
wife
to
you
i
tried
you
wo
forget
will
you
ever
that
i
try
the
nurse
gave
her
a
spoonful
of
brand
meat
jelly
the
journey
was
a
journey
of
jelly
combating
grief
all
the
way
each
relapse
into
woe
was
instantly
interrupted
by
jelly
and
it
was
not
till
the
evening
when
they
reached
the
little
pension
on
the
sands
which
was
to
be
their
home
for
two
months
and
ingeborg
going
to
the
open
window
gave
a
quick
cry
as
the
full
freshness
and
saltness
and
heaving
glancing
beauty
burst
upon
her
that
the
nurse
threw
the
rest
of
the
tin
away
and
put
her
trust
altogether
in
the
sea
herr
dremmel
returned
to
his
wifeless
home
in
a
meditative
frame
of
mind
as
he
jolted
along
in
the
same
carriage
only
grown
more
shaky
in
which
he
had
brought
his
bride
back
seven
years
before
he
indulged
first
in
a
brief
wonder
at
the
ups
and
downs
of
women
from
this
he
passed
to
a
consideration
of
the
superior
reliability
of
chemicals
from
this
again
he
proceeded
to
reflect
that
nevertheless
a
man
life
should
be
decorated
at
the
edges
and
that
the
most
satisfactory
decoration
was
a
wife
and
family
ingeborg
in
spite
of
her
ups
and
downs
had
been
a
good
wife
to
him
and
he
did
not
regret
having
attached
her
to
his
edges
but
then
he
also
had
done
his
part
and
been
a
good
husband
to
her
few
marriages
he
thought
could
have
been
so
harmonious
and
successful
as
theirs
he
loved
her
as
an
honest
man
should
love
his
wife
at
judicious
intervals
always
he
had
affection
for
her
and
liked
being
with
her
when
she
was
feeling
well
her
money
every
wife
should
have
a
little
had
helped
him
much
indeed
had
made
most
of
the
successes
that
had
rewarded
his
labours
possible
and
she
had
given
him
a
child
a
year
which
was
he
was
aware
the
maximum
output
and
rendered
him
civically
satisfactory
that
these
children
should
four
of
them
not
have
succeeded
in
staying
alive
and
that
the
two
who
had
should
bear
so
striking
a
resemblance
to
his
mother
a
person
he
knew
for
unintelligent
were
misfortunes
but
one
did
not
dwell
on
misfortunes
one
turned
one
back
on
them
and
went
away
and
worked
the
central
fact
of
life
its
core
of
splendour
he
said
to
himself
as
arrived
at
home
he
hung
up
his
hat
in
the
passage
and
prepared
to
plunge
with
renewed
appetite
into
his
laboratory
was
work
but
he
added
as
he
passed
the
open
door
of
the
and
was
reminded
by
its
untidiness
of
domesticities
since
one
had
to
withdraw
occasionally
from
the
heat
of
that
great
middle
light
and
refresh
oneself
in
something
cooler
one
needed
a
place
of
relaxation
where
the
interest
was
more
attenuated
a
ring
of
relative
tepidity
round
the
bright
centre
of
one
life
and
this
ring
was
excellently
supplied
by
the
object
commonly
called
the
family
circle
the
harder
he
worked
the
more
hotly
he
pursued
knowledge
the
more
urgent
was
a
man
need
for
intervals
of
tepidity
one
sought
out
one
little
wife
and
rested
brain
one
took
one
son
on
one
knee
one
pulled
perhaps
the
plait
of
one
daughter
life
for
herr
dremmel
was
both
great
and
simple
during
the
seven
years
of
his
marriage
it
had
become
continually
more
so
there
were
times
he
could
remember
previous
to
that
event
when
he
had
lost
sight
of
this
truth
in
a
confused
hankering
periods
during
which
he
had
hankered
persistently
moments
that
astonished
him
afterwards
to
call
to
mind
when
the
lilacs
being
out
in
the
garden
and
the
young
corn
of
the
fields
asprout
in
the
warm
spring
sun
his
laboratory
that
place
of
hopes
and
visions
had
incredibly
appeared
to
him
to
be
mere
bones
marriage
had
banished
these
distortions
of
perception
and
he
had
lived
seven
years
in
the
full
magnificent
consciousness
of
the
greatness
and
simplicity
of
life
he
was
armoured
by
his
singleness
of
purpose
he
never
came
out
of
his
armour
and
was
petty
not
once
while
ingeborg
in
a
distant
corner
of
the
house
was
fearing
that
she
had
hurt
him
or
offended
him
or
had
made
him
think
she
did
not
love
him
had
he
been
hurt
or
offended
or
thinking
anything
of
the
sort
he
was
absorbed
in
great
things
great
interests
great
values
there
was
no
room
in
his
thoughts
for
meditations
on
minor
concerns
the
days
were
not
wide
enough
for
the
bigness
they
had
to
hold
and
it
never
would
have
occurred
to
him
to
devote
any
portion
of
their
already
limited
space
to
inquiring
if
he
had
been
hurt
his
interested
eyes
carefully
examining
and
comparing
and
criticising
phenomena
had
no
time
for
introspection
as
the
years
passed
and
successes
followed
upon
his
patience
his
absorption
and
subjugation
by
his
work
became
increasingly
profound
for
a
man
has
but
a
handful
of
years
and
can
not
during
that
brief
span
live
too
inquisitively
herr
dremmel
was
wringing
more
out
of
nature
who
only
asks
to
be
forced
to
tell
each
year
he
was
accumulating
experiences
and
knowledge
of
an
interest
and
value
so
great
that
everything
else
was
trivial
beside
them
the
passing
day
was
forgotten
in
the
interest
of
the
day
that
was
to
come
the
future
was
what
his
brain
was
perpetually
concerned
with
and
an
eye
ranging
with
growing
keenness
over
a
growingly
splendid
and
detailed
vision
can
not
observe
it
would
be
an
interruption
a
waste
to
observe
the
fluctuations
in
the
moods
of
for
instance
a
family
or
a
parish
wives
children
and
parishes
are
adornments
obligations
and
means
of
livelihood
they
are
what
a
man
has
as
well
but
only
as
well
herr
dremmel
during
these
years
had
trained
his
parish
to
be
unobtrusive
in
return
for
his
own
unobtrusiveness
and
in
spite
of
occasional
restiveness
on
the
part
of
baron
glambeck
who
continued
from
time
to
time
on
the
ground
that
the
parish
was
becoming
heathen
and
displaying
the
smug
contentment
characteristic
of
that
condition
to
endeavour
to
persuade
the
authorities
to
remove
him
somewhere
else
was
more
firmly
established
than
ever
in
the
heart
of
a
flock
that
only
wanted
to
be
left
alone
and
as
for
his
wife
and
children
he
regarded
them
benevolently
as
the
necessary
foundation
of
his
existence
the
airy
cellars
that
kept
the
fabric
above
sweet
and
dry
like
cellars
one
had
to
have
them
and
one
was
glad
when
they
were
good
but
one
did
not
live
in
them
as
a
wise
man
who
wished
to
do
fine
work
before
being
overtaken
by
the
incapacitations
of
death
he
had
contrived
his
life
so
that
it
should
contain
enough
love
to
make
him
able
to
forget
love
it
is
not
he
had
come
to
know
very
well
since
his
marriage
by
doing
without
but
by
having
that
one
can
clear
one
mind
of
wanting
and
it
is
only
the
cleared
mind
that
can
achieve
anything
at
all
in
the
great
work
of
helping
the
world
to
move
more
quickly
on
its
journey
towards
the
light
for
some
weeks
after
ingeborg
departure
he
was
immensely
unaware
of
her
absence
it
was
june
that
crowded
month
for
him
who
has
experimental
fields
and
small
discomforts
at
home
such
as
unpunctual
meals
and
rooms
growing
steadily
less
dusted
at
no
time
attracted
his
notice
he
would
come
out
of
his
laboratory
after
a
good
morning
work
in
much
the
same
spirit
with
which
the
bridegroom
issuing
from
his
chamber
a
person
details
can
not
touch
is
filled
and
would
eat
contentedly
any
food
he
found
lying
about
and
be
off
to
his
fields
almost
before
robertlet
and
ditti
had
done
struggling
with
their
bibs
and
saying
their
preliminary
grace
the
children
however
took
no
base
advantage
of
this
being
left
to
themselves
robertlet
did
not
turn
on
ditti
and
seize
her
dinner
because
she
was
a
girl
ditti
did
not
conceal
more
than
her
share
of
pudding
in
her
pocket
for
comfort
during
the
empty
afternoon
hours
they
sat
in
silence
working
through
the
meal
using
their
knives
to
eat
with
instead
of
their
forks
for
knives
rather
than
forks
were
in
their
blood
and
unmoved
by
the
way
in
which
bits
they
had
carefully
stalked
round
and
round
their
plates
ended
by
tumbling
over
the
edge
on
to
the
tablecloth
they
were
patient
children
and
when
that
happened
they
made
no
comment
but
dropping
their
knives
also
on
the
tablecloth
picked
up
the
bits
in
their
fingers
and
ate
them
at
the
end
ditti
said
the
closing
grace
as
her
mother
had
taught
her
robertlet
having
officiated
at
the
opening
one
and
they
both
stood
behind
their
chairs
with
their
eyes
shut
while
she
expressed
gratitude
in
german
to
the
dear
saviour
who
had
had
the
friendliness
to
be
their
guest
on
that
occasion
and
having
reached
the
amen
in
which
robertlet
joined
they
did
not
fall
upon
each
other
and
fight
as
other
unshepherded
children
filled
with
meat
and
pudding
might
have
done
but
left
the
room
in
a
sober
file
and
went
to
the
kitchen
and
requested
the
servant
rosa
who
was
the
one
who
would
have
been
their
nurse
if
they
had
had
one
to
accompany
them
to
their
bedroom
and
see
that
they
cleaned
their
teeth
they
spent
the
afternoons
in
not
being
naughty
herr
dremmel
accordingly
because
of
this
health
and
sobriety
in
his
children
and
his
own
indifference
to
his
comfort
had
no
domestic
worries
such
as
engulf
other
men
whose
wives
are
away
to
disturb
him
and
it
was
not
till
july
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
a
long
drought
forced
leisure
upon
him
that
ingeborg
image
began
to
obtrude
itself
through
the
chinks
of
his
work
at
first
he
thought
of
her
as
a
mother
as
somebody
heavy
continually
recovering
from
or
preparing
for
illness
but
presently
he
began
to
think
of
her
as
a
wife
as
his
wife
as
his
proper
complement
and
relaxation
from
all
this
toil
shut
up
in
a
dull
laboratory
she
seemed
to
grow
brighter
and
lighter
thought
of
like
that
and
by
the
time
he
received
a
letter
asking
if
she
might
stay
away
another
fortnight
to
complete
what
was
being
a
thorough
cure
she
was
so
brightly
in
his
mind
that
he
felt
extremely
disappointed
he
wrote
giving
the
permission
she
asked
and
made
the
discovery
that
his
house
looked
empty
and
that
a
fortnight
was
long
he
paced
the
garden
in
the
hot
evenings
smoking
beneath
the
where
he
and
she
at
the
beginning
used
so
gaily
to
breakfast
and
forgot
how
slow
of
movement
and
mind
she
had
been
for
several
years
how
little
he
had
really
seen
of
her
how
more
and
more
his
attitude
towards
her
had
been
one
of
patience
and
when
he
went
in
to
his
supper
which
he
suddenly
did
not
like
and
criticised
what
he
found
himself
looking
for
was
not
the
figure
he
had
been
used
to
find
lying
silent
on
the
sofa
but
the
quick
light
flitting
thing
that
laughed
and
pulled
his
ears
the
ingeborg
of
the
beginning
his
little
sheep
on
the
day
she
came
home
although
it
was
the
very
height
of
harvesting
and
the
first
samples
of
the
year
grain
lay
on
his
table
waiting
to
be
examined
he
gave
up
the
afternoon
to
driving
in
to
meuk
to
meet
her
and
waited
on
the
platform
with
an
impatient
expectancy
he
had
not
felt
for
years
it
is
not
good
for
man
to
live
alone
were
his
first
words
as
he
embraced
her
largely
in
the
door
of
the
railway
carriage
while
the
porter
in
a
fever
to
get
out
the
hand
luggage
and
run
and
attend
to
other
passengers
had
to
wait
till
he
had
done
little
sheep
how
could
you
stay
away
so
long
from
the
old
shepherd
she
was
looking
very
well
he
thought
sunburnt
and
with
many
new
freckles
rounder
quite
young
a
sweet
little
wife
for
a
long
solitary
husband
to
have
coming
home
to
him
he
lifted
her
proudly
into
the
carriage
and
drove
through
meuk
with
his
arm
round
her
waving
the
other
one
at
the
doctor
who
rallied
past
them
in
his
own
high
shaky
vehicle
and
shouting
cured
the
doctor
however
seemed
surprised
at
seeing
ingeborg
and
did
not
smile
back
but
looked
inscrutably
at
them
both
she
asked
about
the
welfare
of
the
children
and
whether
their
ears
had
been
properly
washed
ears
exclaimed
herr
dremmel
and
what
pray
have
the
ears
of
others
to
do
with
a
reunited
wedded
couple
she
hoped
a
little
hurriedly
that
rosa
and
the
cook
had
been
good
to
him
rosa
and
the
cook
he
cried
what
talk
is
this
of
rosa
and
the
cook
if
you
are
not
silent
with
your
domesticities
i
will
kiss
you
here
and
now
in
the
middle
of
the
open
highroad
she
said
she
had
never
really
thanked
him
for
letting
her
go
to
zoppot
and
be
there
so
long
too
long
little
one
he
interrupted
drawing
her
closer
almost
had
i
forgotten
what
a
dear
little
wife
i
possess
but
i
going
to
make
up
for
it
all
now
she
said
and
work
harder
than
i
ever
done
in
my
life
at
making
the
good
robert
happy
he
said
pinching
her
ear
and
doing
things
for
the
children
dreadful
to
think
of
them
all
this
time
without
me
were
they
good
good
as
fishes
robert
fishes
they
are
well
little
one
and
happy
that
is
enough
about
the
children
tell
me
rather
about
you
how
you
filled
up
your
days
i
walked
i
sailed
i
bathed
i
lay
in
the
sun
and
i
made
resolutions
excellent
i
shall
await
the
result
with
interest
i
hope
you
like
them
i
know
they
be
very
good
for
the
children
she
had
so
earnest
a
face
that
he
pulled
it
round
by
the
chin
and
peered
at
it
seen
close
she
was
always
prettiest
full
of
delicacy
and
charm
of
soft
fair
skin
and
after
examining
her
a
moment
with
a
pleased
smile
he
stooped
down
and
did
after
all
kiss
her
she
flushed
and
resisted
what
he
said
amused
the
little
wife
growing
virginal
again
you
made
my
hat
crooked
she
said
putting
up
her
hands
to
straighten
it
robert
how
are
the
fields
i
will
not
talk
about
the
fields
i
will
talk
about
you
oh
robert
you
know
she
added
nervously
i
not
well
yet
i
still
got
to
go
on
taking
tiresome
things
that
tonic
you
know
the
doctor
there
said
i
still
anæmic
we
will
feed
her
on
portions
of
the
strongest
ox
so
you
must
mind
if
i
if
i
i
mind
nothing
if
only
i
once
more
have
my
little
wife
at
home
said
herr
dremmel
and
when
he
helped
her
down
on
to
the
parsonage
steps
where
stood
robertlet
and
ditti
in
a
stiff
and
proper
row
waiting
motionless
till
their
mother
should
have
got
near
enough
for
them
to
present
her
with
the
nosegays
they
were
holding
he
kissed
her
again
and
again
pinched
her
ear
and
praised
god
aloud
that
his
widowerhood
was
over
they
had
tea
a
meal
that
had
long
before
been
substituted
for
the
heavier
refreshment
of
coffee
in
a
parlour
filled
with
flowers
by
rosa
and
the
cook
the
very
cake
baked
for
the
occasion
being
strewn
with
them
herr
dremmel
lounged
on
the
sofa
behind
the
table
looking
placidly
content
with
one
arm
round
his
wife
while
robertlet
and
ditti
awed
by
the
splendours
of
the
decorations
for
their
mother
and
their
own
best
clothes
and
spotless
bibs
sat
opposite
being
more
completely
good
than
ever
from
their
side
of
the
table
they
stared
unflinchingly
at
the
two
people
on
the
sofa
at
their
comfortably
reclining
father
whom
they
knew
so
differently
as
a
being
always
hurriedly
going
somewhere
else
at
their
mother
sitting
up
very
straight
with
her
veil
pushed
up
over
her
nose
pouring
out
tea
and
smiling
at
them
and
keeping
on
giving
them
more
jam
and
more
milk
and
more
cake
even
after
aware
from
their
sensations
that
overflowing
could
not
be
far
off
they
had
informed
her
by
anxious
repetitions
of
the
word
which
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
that
they
were
already
in
a
dangerous
condition
and
they
wondered
dimly
why
when
she
poured
out
the
tea
her
hand
shook
and
made
it
spill
i
will
now
said
herr
dremmel
when
the
meal
was
finished
getting
up
and
brushing
crumbs
out
of
the
many
folds
that
were
characteristic
of
his
clothes
retire
for
a
space
into
my
laboratory
he
looked
at
ingeborg
and
smiled
picture
it
he
said
the
only
solace
i
have
now
had
for
two
months
and
a
half
has
been
in
the
bony
arms
of
my
laboratory
i
grow
weary
of
them
it
is
well
to
have
little
wife
home
again
a
man
to
do
his
work
needs
his
life
complete
equipped
in
each
of
its
directions
his
laboratory
seems
bony
to
him
if
he
has
not
also
a
wife
his
wife
would
seem
not
bony
enough
if
he
had
not
also
a
laboratory
bony
and
boneless
bony
and
boneless
it
is
the
swing
of
the
pendulum
of
the
wise
man
life
and
he
bent
over
her
and
lifted
her
face
up
again
by
putting
his
finger
under
her
chin
is
it
not
so
little
one
he
asked
smiling
i
suppose
so
said
ingeborg
suppose
so
he
laughed
and
pulled
an
escaping
tendril
of
her
hair
and
went
away
in
great
contentment
and
immersed
himself
very
happily
in
the
saucers
of
new
grain
waiting
to
be
weighed
and
counted
it
was
a
fine
august
afternoon
and
his
windows
were
open
for
there
was
no
wind
to
blow
his
papers
about
and
he
was
pleased
when
he
presently
became
aware
out
of
the
corner
of
an
eye
withdrawn
an
instant
from
its
work
that
his
wife
had
come
out
on
to
the
path
below
and
was
walking
up
and
down
it
in
the
way
she
used
to
before
the
acuter
period
of
the
sofa
and
the
interest
in
life
beyond
the
grave
had
set
in
he
liked
to
see
her
there
there
was
a
grass
bank
sloping
up
from
the
path
to
beneath
his
windows
and
by
standing
on
on
the
top
of
this
and
stretching
up
an
arm
as
far
as
it
would
go
one
was
just
able
to
tap
against
the
glass
he
remembered
how
she
used
to
do
this
when
first
they
were
married
on
very
fine
days
to
try
to
lure
him
out
from
his
duties
into
dalliance
with
her
among
the
lilacs
it
amused
him
to
find
himself
almost
inclined
to
hope
she
would
do
it
now
for
it
was
long
since
there
had
been
dalliance
and
he
felt
this
was
an
occasion
this
restoration
to
normality
on
which
some
slight
trifling
in
a
garden
would
not
be
inappropriate
but
ingeborg
though
she
loitered
there
nearly
half
an
hour
did
not
even
look
up
she
wandered
up
and
down
in
the
cool
shade
the
house
threw
across
the
path
in
the
afternoon
her
hat
off
apparently
merely
enjoying
the
beauty
of
a
summer
day
bending
towards
its
evening
and
presently
he
forgot
her
in
the
vivid
interest
of
what
he
was
doing
so
that
it
was
the
surprised
expression
of
some
one
who
has
forgotten
and
is
trying
to
recall
that
he
looked
at
her
when
after
a
knock
at
the
door
which
he
had
not
heard
he
saw
her
come
in
and
stand
at
the
corner
of
his
table
waiting
till
he
had
done
counting
a
process
he
conducted
aloud
to
the
end
of
the
row
of
grains
he
was
engaged
upon
his
thoughts
were
still
chiefly
with
them
as
he
looked
up
at
her
when
he
had
done
and
had
written
down
the
result
but
there
was
room
in
them
also
for
a
slight
wonder
that
she
should
be
there
she
had
not
penetrated
into
his
laboratory
for
years
she
had
been
tamed
after
a
period
of
recurring
insurrections
into
respect
for
its
sanctity
but
he
did
not
mind
being
interrupted
on
this
occasion
on
the
contrary
as
soon
as
he
had
fully
returned
to
consciousness
he
was
pleased
there
was
a
large
warmth
pervading
herr
dremmel
that
afternoon
which
made
him
inclined
not
to
mind
anything
well
little
one
he
said
immediately
she
began
to
deliver
what
sounded
like
a
speech
he
gazed
at
her
in
astonishment
she
appeared
to
be
in
a
condition
of
extreme
excitement
she
was
addressing
him
rapidly
in
a
trembling
voice
she
was
much
flushed
and
was
holding
on
to
the
edge
of
the
table
it
was
so
sudden
and
so
headlong
that
it
was
like
nothing
so
much
as
the
gushing
forth
of
the
long
contents
of
an
bottle
and
he
gazed
at
her
in
an
astonishment
that
did
not
for
some
time
permit
him
to
gather
the
drift
of
what
she
was
saying
when
he
did
she
had
already
got
to
the
word
ruins
ruins
repeated
herr
dremmel
ruins
ruins
it
stop
it
go
on
oh
i
saw
it
so
clearly
the
last
part
of
the
time
in
zoppot
i
suppose
it
was
the
sea
wind
blew
me
clear
our
existence
robert
our
decently
happy
existence
in
a
decently
happy
home
with
properly
children
but
interrupted
herr
dremmel
raising
his
hand
one
moment
what
is
it
that
must
stop
oh
do
you
see
all
that
will
be
in
ruins
about
us
but
in
robert
all
our
happy
life
if
i
go
on
in
this
in
this
wild
career
of
of
unbridled
motherhood
herr
dremmel
stared
unbridled
he
began
then
he
repeated
so
deep
was
his
astonishment
wild
career
of
ingeborg
did
you
say
unbridled
motherhood
yes
said
ingeborg
pressing
her
hands
together
evidently
extraordinarily
agitated
i
learned
that
by
heart
at
zoppot
on
purpose
to
say
to
you
i
knew
if
i
did
directly
i
got
into
this
room
forget
everything
i
meant
to
say
i
know
it
sounds
ridiculous
the
way
i
say
it
unbridled
motherhood
repeated
herr
dremmel
but
are
you
not
a
pastor
wife
oh
yes
yes
i
know
i
know
i
know
there
duty
and
providence
but
there
me
too
there
is
me
too
and
robert
wo
you
see
we
shall
be
happy
again
if
i
well
we
shall
be
two
real
people
instead
of
just
one
person
and
a
bit
of
one
you
and
a
battered
thing
on
a
sofa
ingeborg
you
call
a
wife
and
a
mother
engaged
in
carrying
out
her
obligations
a
battered
thing
on
a
sofa
yes
said
ingeborg
hurrying
on
to
the
principal
sentence
of
those
she
had
prepared
at
zoppot
and
learned
by
heart
desperately
clutching
at
it
before
robert
questions
had
undermined
her
courage
and
befogged
the
issues
yes
and
i
come
to
the
conclusion
after
ripe
meditation
after
ripe
yes
the
production
of
the
of
the
yes
of
the
already
extinct
dead
seemed
an
unkind
word
almost
rude
is
wasteful
and
that
and
that
robert
she
cried
flinging
out
her
hands
and
letting
go
all
the
rest
of
the
things
she
had
learned
to
say
do
you
think
this
persistent
parenthood
might
end
now
he
stared
at
her
in
utter
amazement
it
it
with
me
she
said
tears
in
her
voice
and
in
her
anxious
appealing
eyes
am
i
to
under
anyhow
ca
go
on
she
cried
twisting
her
fingers
about
in
an
agony
there
so
little
of
me
to
go
on
i
getting
stupider
every
day
i
got
no
brains
left
i
got
no
anything
why
i
can
hardly
get
together
enough
courage
to
tell
you
this
oh
robert
she
appealed
it
is
as
though
it
made
you
happier
you
really
notice
the
children
when
they
there
it
as
though
it
made
anybody
happier
and
and
i
dreadfully
sorry
but
i
done
and
she
dropped
on
to
the
floor
beside
him
and
put
her
cheek
against
his
sleeve
and
tried
to
make
up
by
kissing
it
and
clinging
to
it
for
her
subversion
of
that
strange
tremendous
combination
of
duty
and
providence
that
so
bestrode
her
life
if
only
you
would
she
kept
on
saying
but
herr
dremmel
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
known
her
was
deeply
offended
deeply
hurt
she
had
pierced
his
armour
at
the
one
vulnerable
spot
his
manhood
was
outraged
his
kindness
his
patience
his
affection
were
forgotten
and
spurned
he
looked
down
at
the
head
against
his
arm
with
a
face
in
which
wounded
pride
wrath
shockedness
at
so
great
a
defiance
of
duty
and
the
amazed
aggrievement
of
him
whose
gifts
and
blessings
are
not
wanted
struggled
together
then
as
she
still
went
on
clinging
and
incoherently
suggesting
that
he
should
not
mind
he
rose
up
took
her
by
the
hand
helped
her
to
her
feet
and
led
her
to
the
door
and
there
after
facing
her
a
moment
in
silence
with
it
opened
in
his
hand
while
she
stood
blinking
up
at
him
with
appealing
eyes
he
said
dreadfully
evidently
you
do
not
and
never
have
loved
me
chapter
xxiii
ingeborg
crept
away
down
the
passage
with
the
sound
in
her
ears
of
the
key
being
turned
in
the
lock
behind
her
she
was
crushed
that
robert
should
think
she
had
never
loved
him
that
he
should
not
even
let
her
tell
him
how
much
she
had
and
did
she
stared
out
of
the
little
window
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
at
the
untidy
vegetables
in
the
garden
this
was
the
quality
of
life
brussels
sprouts
and
a
door
being
locked
behind
one
it
was
all
grey
and
difficult
and
tragic
she
had
hurt
robert
offended
him
he
was
in
there
thinking
she
did
love
him
what
he
had
said
was
peculiarly
shattering
coming
from
a
mouth
that
had
been
always
kind
yet
what
was
there
to
do
but
this
the
alternative
it
seemed
was
somebody
dying
and
if
the
children
did
live
there
would
be
the
death
of
the
spirit
the
decay
of
all
lovely
things
in
the
home
the
darkening
of
all
light
there
would
be
neglect
apathy
an
utter
running
to
seed
but
she
felt
guilty
and
she
was
no
longer
sure
she
was
right
perhaps
it
was
indeed
her
duty
to
go
on
perhaps
she
was
indeed
being
wicked
and
cruel
the
clearness
of
vision
that
had
been
hers
at
zoppot
was
blurred
she
was
confused
infinitely
distressed
yet
through
the
distress
and
confusion
there
kept
on
jabbing
something
like
a
little
spear
of
light
and
always
it
pointed
in
this
one
direction
she
stood
leaning
against
the
wall
by
the
open
window
a
miserable
mixture
of
doubt
and
conviction
remorse
and
determination
all
her
life
she
had
been
servile
servile
with
the
sudden
rare
tremendous
insurrections
that
upheave
certain
natures
brought
up
in
servility
swift
tempests
more
devastating
than
the
steady
fighting
of
systematic
rebels
her
insurrections
were
when
they
occurred
the
destiny
of
an
entire
family
was
changed
fathers
and
husbands
were
not
prepared
for
anything
but
continued
acquiescence
in
one
so
constantly
acquiescent
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
they
felt
they
might
sleep
peacefully
in
their
beds
then
this
obedient
thing
this
pliable
uncontradicting
thing
would
return
for
instance
from
an
illicit
trip
abroad
betrothed
to
an
unknown
foreigner
and
somehow
in
spite
of
violent
opposition
marry
him
or
as
in
this
second
volcanic
upheaval
with
no
preliminaries
whatever
refuse
point
blank
the
final
effect
on
herr
dremmel
mind
of
her
incoherence
was
a
point
blankness
to
live
with
her
husband
as
his
wife
behind
the
locked
door
his
anger
was
as
great
as
her
distressed
confusion
outside
it
she
was
to
be
his
wife
but
not
his
wife
under
his
roof
a
perpetual
irritation
she
had
decreed
this
woman
who
had
nothing
to
decree
that
there
were
to
be
no
more
dremmels
the
indignation
of
the
thwarted
ancestor
was
heavy
upon
him
her
moral
obliquity
shocked
him
her
disregard
for
the
give
and
take
necessary
if
a
civilised
community
is
to
continue
efficient
how
was
he
going
to
work
with
that
constant
reminder
about
his
house
of
his
past
placidities
already
it
had
begun
the
annoyance
the
hindering
for
here
he
was
sitting
in
front
of
his
samples
making
mistakes
in
weighing
adding
up
wrong
forced
by
humiliatingly
different
results
each
time
to
count
the
grains
over
and
over
again
driven
by
the
stress
of
the
situation
to
unfairness
he
remembered
with
a
kind
of
bitter
affection
those
widows
who
had
darkened
his
past
so
soothingly
before
his
marriage
the
emotional
peace
their
bony
dustiness
their
bonneted
dinginess
had
secured
him
they
had
been
he
perceived
like
a
dark
blind
shading
his
eyes
from
the
tormenting
glare
of
too
much
domesticity
the
most
infuriated
of
that
black
and
blessed
band
had
been
better
than
this
threatening
excess
of
relationship
not
one
had
ever
come
between
him
and
his
steady
reaching
forward
not
one
had
even
once
caused
him
to
count
his
grains
twice
over
a
man
who
wishes
to
work
he
told
himself
must
clear
his
life
of
women
of
all
women
that
is
for
there
are
certain
elementary
actions
connected
with
saucepans
and
bedmaking
that
only
women
will
do
except
widows
a
wife
who
is
not
a
wife
and
who
yet
persists
in
looking
as
if
she
were
one
can
be
nothing
but
a
goad
and
a
burden
for
an
honest
man
either
she
should
look
like
some
one
used
up
and
finished
or
she
should
continue
to
discharge
her
honourable
functions
until
such
time
as
she
developed
the
physical
unattractiveness
that
placed
her
definitely
on
the
list
of
women
one
respects
that
ingeborg
should
choose
the
moment
when
she
seemed
younger
and
rounder
than
ever
to
revolt
against
duty
and
providence
appeared
to
him
in
his
first
wrath
deliberately
malicious
he
was
amazed
he
could
not
believe
he
was
being
called
out
of
his
important
and
serious
work
beckoned
out
of
it
just
when
it
was
going
so
well
in
order
to
be
hurt
in
order
to
be
made
acquainted
with
pain
and
by
her
of
all
people
in
the
world
whom
he
used
to
call
surely
he
had
been
kind
his
little
sheep
to
be
hit
by
one
sheep
to
be
hit
violently
by
it
so
that
the
blows
actually
shook
one
at
the
very
moment
of
greatest
affection
for
it
of
rejoicing
over
its
return
of
plunging
one
hands
most
confidently
into
the
comfort
of
its
wool
herr
dremmel
was
amazed
he
stayed
in
his
laboratory
in
this
condition
till
supper
then
during
the
meal
he
carefully
read
a
book
which
he
propped
up
in
front
of
him
against
the
loaf
while
ingeborg
ministering
to
him
with
the
eager
deftness
of
the
watched
for
a
sign
of
forgiveness
out
of
the
corners
of
red
eyes
he
stayed
after
supper
in
his
laboratory
till
past
midnight
still
being
amazed
reduced
indeed
at
last
to
walking
up
and
down
that
calm
temple
of
untiring
attempts
to
nail
down
ultimate
causes
considering
how
best
he
could
bring
his
wife
to
reason
the
business
of
bringing
a
woman
to
reason
had
always
seemed
to
him
quite
the
most
extravagant
way
of
wasting
good
time
to
have
to
discuss
argue
explain
threaten
adjure
only
in
order
to
get
back
to
the
point
from
which
nobody
ought
ever
to
have
started
was
the
silliest
of
all
silly
necessities
again
he
fumed
at
the
thought
of
an
untractable
undutiful
wife
about
him
and
recognised
the
acute
need
to
be
clear
of
feminine
childishness
egotism
unforeseeable
resiliences
if
a
man
would
work
in
his
stirred
stale
it
appeared
altogether
monstrous
that
the
whole
world
should
be
blotted
out
the
great
wide
world
of
magnificent
opportunity
and
spacious
interest
even
for
a
day
even
for
an
hour
by
the
power
to
make
him
uncomfortable
by
the
power
to
make
him
concentrate
his
brains
on
an
irrelevant
situation
of
one
small
woman
he
went
to
their
room
about
twelve
determined
to
have
no
more
of
the
nonsense
he
would
bring
her
then
and
there
by
the
shortest
possible
route
to
reason
he
would
have
it
out
even
to
the
extent
of
severity
and
have
done
with
it
he
was
master
and
if
she
forced
him
to
emphasize
the
fact
he
would
carrying
the
lamp
he
went
to
their
room
with
the
firm
footsteps
of
one
who
has
ceased
to
be
going
to
stand
things
but
the
room
was
empty
it
was
as
chillily
empty
of
wifely
traces
as
it
had
been
since
the
beginning
of
june
this
is
paltry
thought
herr
dremmel
feeling
the
offence
was
now
so
great
as
to
have
become
ridiculous
and
determined
to
discover
into
what
fastness
she
had
withdrawn
and
fetch
her
out
of
it
he
went
lamp
in
hand
doggedly
through
the
house
looking
for
her
beginning
with
the
thorough
patience
of
one
accustomed
to
research
in
the
kitchen
where
shy
cockroaches
peeped
at
him
round
the
legs
of
tables
examining
the
parlour
stuffy
with
the
exhaustion
of
an
ended
day
penetrating
into
a
room
in
which
rosa
and
the
cook
reared
themselves
up
in
their
beds
to
regard
him
with
horror
unspeakable
and
at
last
stumbling
up
the
narrow
staircase
to
where
robertlet
and
ditti
slept
the
sleep
of
the
unvaryingly
just
here
in
a
third
small
bed
of
the
truckle
type
lay
his
defaulting
wife
her
face
to
the
wall
her
body
composed
into
an
excess
of
motionlessness
ingeborg
he
called
holding
the
lamp
high
over
his
head
but
she
did
not
stir
ingeborg
he
called
again
but
never
did
woman
sleep
so
soundly
he
walked
across
to
the
bed
and
bent
over
searching
her
face
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
most
of
it
was
buried
in
the
pillow
but
the
one
eye
visible
was
tightly
shut
more
immensely
asleep
than
any
eye
he
had
ever
seen
the
indifference
that
could
sleep
while
her
outraged
husband
was
looking
for
her
revolted
him
without
making
any
further
attempt
to
wake
her
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
slamming
the
door
behind
him
went
downstairs
again
that
is
thieves
at
last
remarked
ditti
who
had
been
expecting
them
for
years
brought
out
of
her
dreams
good
dreams
by
the
noise
of
the
door
yes
said
robertlet
also
roused
from
dreams
that
did
him
credit
we
must
now
get
under
the
clothes
said
ditti
who
had
settled
long
ago
what
would
be
the
right
thing
to
do
yes
said
robertlet
you
need
said
ingeborg
out
of
the
darkness
they
both
started
they
had
forgotten
she
was
there
it
was
only
papa
put
the
thought
of
papa
coming
up
to
their
room
and
banging
the
door
in
the
middle
of
the
night
filled
them
in
its
strangeness
with
an
even
greater
uneasiness
they
would
have
preferred
thieves
and
after
some
preliminary
lying
quiet
and
being
good
they
one
after
the
other
withdrew
as
silently
as
possible
beneath
the
comfort
of
the
clothes
where
they
waited
in
neat
patience
for
the
next
thing
papa
might
do
until
stifled
but
uncomplaining
they
once
more
fell
asleep
there
followed
some
days
of
strain
in
the
kökensee
parsonage
herr
dremmel
retired
into
an
extremity
of
silence
made
no
allusion
to
these
regrettable
incidents
became
at
meals
a
mere
figure
behind
a
newspaper
and
at
other
times
was
not
there
at
all
he
had
decided
that
he
would
not
waste
his
energies
in
anger
at
the
earliest
opportunity
he
would
drive
in
to
meuk
call
on
the
doctor
and
after
explaining
the
effect
of
zoppot
a
place
which
was
to
have
cured
her
on
his
wife
request
him
now
to
prescribe
a
cure
for
the
cure
it
was
ingeborg
business
to
come
to
her
husband
and
ask
for
forgiveness
and
he
would
give
her
these
few
days
in
which
to
do
it
if
she
did
not
he
would
know
after
consultation
with
the
doctor
what
course
to
take
whether
of
severity
or
whether
setting
aside
his
manhood
it
was
not
rather
an
occasion
on
which
one
ought
to
coax
he
was
after
all
too
humane
to
resort
without
medical
sanction
to
scenes
perhaps
what
she
needed
was
only
a
corrective
to
zoppot
there
was
such
a
thing
as
excess
of
salubriousness
having
made
up
his
mind
he
found
himself
calmer
able
to
work
again
in
the
knowledge
that
in
a
few
days
he
would
be
clear
with
the
aid
of
the
doctor
as
to
what
should
be
done
and
ingeborg
had
nothing
to
complain
of
except
that
he
would
not
speak
several
times
she
tried
to
reopen
the
so
hastily
closed
subject
but
got
no
further
in
the
face
of
his
monumental
silence
than
but
robert
she
took
the
children
for
outings
in
the
forest
and
while
they
did
not
chatter
merrily
together
and
did
not
play
at
games
she
thought
over
all
the
ways
that
were
really
tactful
of
luring
him
to
reasonable
discussion
she
knew
she
had
made
a
lamentable
first
appearance
in
the
of
a
retiring
mother
but
how
difficult
it
was
when
you
felt
overwhelmingly
to
talk
objectively
and
then
there
were
tears
a
woman
cried
and
what
a
handicap
that
was
before
the
first
semicolon
in
any
vital
discourse
with
one
husband
was
reached
one
was
dissolved
in
tears
thought
ingeborg
ashamed
and
resentful
and
robert
grew
so
calm
and
patient
so
disconcertingly
calm
and
patient
when
faced
by
crying
he
sat
there
like
some
large
god
untouched
by
human
distress
waiting
for
the
return
of
reason
it
is
true
he
cried
too
sometimes
but
only
about
odd
things
like
christmas
eves
and
sons
if
they
were
sufficiently
new
born
things
that
came
under
the
category
surely
of
cheerful
at
most
of
cheerfully
touching
but
he
never
cried
about
these
great
important
issues
these
questions
on
which
all
one
happiness
hung
life
would
run
more
easily
she
thought
if
husbands
and
wives
had
the
same
taste
in
tears
four
days
after
her
return
home
she
asked
him
to
forgive
her
it
was
at
the
end
of
supper
and
he
had
just
removed
his
book
from
the
supporting
loaf
and
was
getting
up
to
go
when
she
ran
across
to
him
with
the
quickness
of
despair
and
laid
hold
of
him
by
both
his
sleeves
and
said
forgive
me
he
looked
down
at
her
with
a
gleam
in
his
eye
he
would
not
have
to
go
to
meuk
after
all
do
she
begged
robert
do
you
know
i
love
you
i
so
miserable
to
have
hurt
you
do
let
be
friends
wo
we
friends
echoed
herr
dremmel
drawing
back
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
to
me
oh
do
be
friends
i
ca
bear
this
ingeborg
he
said
with
the
severity
of
disappointment
pulling
his
sleeves
out
of
her
hands
and
going
to
the
door
have
you
then
not
yet
discovered
that
a
true
husband
and
wife
can
never
be
friends
oh
but
how
dreadful
said
ingeborg
dropping
her
hands
by
her
side
and
staring
after
him
as
he
went
out
toward
the
end
of
the
week
when
her
unassisted
meditations
continued
to
produce
no
suggestions
of
any
use
for
removing
the
stain
that
undoubtedly
rested
on
her
she
thought
she
would
go
in
to
meuk
and
seek
the
counsel
of
the
doctor
he
had
always
been
good
to
her
kind
and
understanding
she
would
go
to
him
more
in
the
spirit
of
one
who
goes
to
a
priest
than
to
a
doctor
and
inquire
of
him
earnestly
what
she
should
do
to
be
saved
she
found
the
position
at
home
unendurable
if
the
doctor
told
her
that
it
was
her
duty
to
go
on
having
children
and
that
it
was
mere
chance
the
two
last
had
been
born
dead
she
would
resume
her
career
it
was
a
miserable
career
a
terrible
maimed
thing
but
less
miserable
than
doubt
as
to
whether
one
were
not
being
wicked
and
robert
was
being
utterly
right
not
for
nothing
was
she
the
daughter
of
a
bishop
and
had
enjoyed
for
years
the
privileges
of
a
christian
home
also
she
well
knew
that
the
public
opinion
of
kökensee
and
glambeck
would
be
against
her
in
this
matter
of
rebellion
and
she
felt
too
weak
to
stand
up
alone
against
these
big
things
she
had
never
been
able
to
hold
out
long
against
prolonged
disapproval
nor
had
she
ever
been
able
to
endure
that
people
round
her
should
not
be
happy
by
the
end
of
the
week
she
was
so
wretched
and
so
full
of
doubts
that
she
decided
to
put
her
trust
in
meuk
and
abide
by
the
decision
of
its
doctor
and
so
it
happened
that
she
set
out
on
the
walk
to
it
on
the
same
day
on
which
herr
dremmel
drove
there
he
had
driven
off
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
with
sandwiches
for
himself
and
the
coachman
in
the
direction
of
the
experiment
ground
telling
her
he
would
not
be
in
till
the
evening
so
she
seized
the
favourable
opportunity
and
also
armed
with
sandwiches
started
soon
after
twelve
for
meuk
the
doctor
consulting
hour
was
she
knew
from
two
to
three
and
if
she
were
there
punctually
at
two
she
could
talk
to
him
have
her
fate
decided
and
be
home
again
by
four
she
walked
along
the
edge
of
the
harvested
eating
her
sandwiches
as
she
went
and
refusing
to
think
for
this
brief
hour
and
a
half
of
the
difficulties
of
life
her
mind
was
weary
of
them
she
would
put
them
away
from
her
for
this
one
walk
it
was
the
brightest
of
august
middays
the
world
seemed
filled
with
every
element
of
happiness
some
people
probably
friends
of
the
glambecks
were
shooting
partridges
over
the
stubble
the
lupin
fields
were
in
their
full
glory
and
their
peculiar
orange
scent
met
her
all
along
the
way
there
was
a
mile
of
sandy
track
to
be
waded
through
and
then
came
four
good
miles
of
hard
white
highroad
between
reddening
mountain
ashes
to
meuk
walking
in
that
clear
fresh
warmth
so
bright
with
colour
so
sweet
with
scents
she
could
not
but
begin
gradually
to
glow
and
by
the
time
she
arrived
at
the
doctor
house
however
wan
her
spirits
might
be
the
rest
of
her
was
so
rosy
that
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
tried
to
head
her
off
from
the
to
the
other
end
of
the
passage
persuaded
that
what
she
had
come
for
could
not
be
the
doctor
but
an
animated
call
on
the
doctor
wife
she
entered
the
a
dingy
place
with
much
the
effect
of
a
shaft
of
light
piercing
through
a
fog
and
there
sitting
at
the
table
turning
over
the
fingered
and
aged
piles
of
illustrated
weeklies
she
found
herr
dremmel
for
a
moment
they
stared
at
each
other
there
was
no
one
else
there
through
could
be
heard
the
murmur
of
a
patient
consulting
in
the
next
room
meuk
was
not
usually
a
sick
place
and
nine
times
out
of
ten
the
doctor
read
his
newspaper
undisturbed
from
two
to
three
this
was
the
tenth
time
and
though
it
had
only
just
struck
two
a
patient
was
with
him
already
herr
dremmel
and
ingeborg
stared
at
each
other
for
a
moment
without
speaking
then
he
said
suddenly
angered
by
the
realisation
that
she
had
come
in
to
meuk
without
asking
him
if
she
might
you
did
not
tell
me
you
were
coming
here
no
said
ingeborg
why
have
you
come
she
sat
down
as
inconspicuously
as
she
could
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
in
a
corner
and
clung
to
her
umbrella
it
was
the
awkwardest
thing
meeting
robert
there
i
i
just
thought
i
would
she
murmured
you
do
not
look
you
were
not
ill
this
morning
it
psychological
murmured
ingeborg
unnerved
and
laying
hold
of
the
first
word
that
darted
into
her
undisciplined
brain
psycho
are
ill
robert
she
asked
suddenly
anxious
why
have
come
my
dear
wife
that
is
my
affair
said
herr
dremmel
who
was
particularly
annoyed
and
puzzled
by
her
presence
oh
murmured
ingeborg
she
had
never
yet
heard
herself
called
his
dear
wife
and
felt
the
immensity
of
her
relegation
to
her
proper
place
he
fluttered
the
pages
of
the
she
held
on
tighter
to
what
seemed
to
be
her
only
friend
her
umbrella
did
you
walk
he
asked
presently
letting
off
the
question
at
her
like
a
gun
yes
oh
yes
said
ingeborg
with
hasty
meekness
what
had
she
come
for
thought
herr
dremmel
fluttering
the
pages
faster
ridiculous
to
pretend
she
needed
a
doctor
she
looked
sitting
there
with
her
unusual
pink
cheeks
like
a
flourishing
sixteen
at
most
eighteen
what
had
he
come
for
thought
ingeborg
wishing
life
would
not
deal
so
upsettingly
in
coincidences
and
keeping
her
eyes
carefully
on
the
carpet
then
a
swift
fear
jumped
at
her
heart
suppose
he
were
ill
suppose
he
had
begun
to
have
one
of
those
large
determined
obscure
diseases
that
seem
to
mow
down
men
and
make
the
world
so
much
a
place
of
widows
she
had
observed
that
for
one
widower
in
kökensee
and
the
surrounding
district
there
were
ten
widows
the
women
appeared
to
ail
through
life
constantly
being
smitten
down
by
one
thing
after
the
other
but
at
least
they
stayed
alive
while
the
men
who
went
year
by
year
out
robustly
to
work
died
after
a
single
smiting
perhaps
want
of
practice
in
being
smitten
she
thought
and
looked
anxiously
under
her
eyelashes
at
robert
struggling
with
a
desire
to
go
over
and
implore
him
to
tell
her
what
was
the
matter
in
another
moment
she
would
have
gone
driven
across
by
her
impulses
if
the
had
not
been
thrown
open
and
the
doctor
appeared
bowing
ich
said
the
doctor
to
herr
dremmel
not
perceiving
ingeborg
who
was
shuttered
out
of
sight
by
the
one
half
of
the
door
he
had
opened
ah
it
is
the
herr
pastor
he
added
less
officially
on
recognising
him
and
advanced
holding
out
his
hand
i
hope
my
friend
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
you
herr
dremmel
did
not
answer
but
seizing
his
hat
made
a
movement
of
a
forestalling
character
towards
the
consulting
room
and
the
doctor
turning
to
follow
him
beheld
ingeborg
in
her
corner
behind
the
door
ah
the
frau
pastor
he
said
bowing
again
and
again
advancing
with
an
extended
hand
which
he
added
looking
from
one
to
the
other
is
the
patient
but
herr
dremmel
back
disappearing
with
determination
into
the
next
room
suggested
an
acute
need
of
assistance
not
visible
in
his
retiring
attitude
you
tell
me
the
about
him
wo
you
she
whispered
anxiously
you
wo
hide
things
from
me
the
doctor
looked
grave
is
it
so
serious
he
asked
and
hurried
after
herr
dremmel
and
shut
the
door
ingeborg
sat
and
waited
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
she
heard
much
murmuring
and
often
both
voices
murmured
together
which
puzzled
her
sometimes
indeed
they
ceased
to
be
murmurs
and
rose
to
a
point
at
which
they
became
distinct
you
forget
i
am
a
christian
pastor
she
heard
robert
say
but
they
dropped
again
though
never
into
a
pause
never
into
those
moments
of
silence
during
which
robert
might
be
guessed
to
be
putting
out
his
tongue
or
having
suspect
portions
of
his
person
prodded
she
sat
there
worried
and
anxious
all
her
own
affairs
forgotten
in
this
fear
of
something
amiss
with
him
and
when
at
last
the
door
opened
again
and
both
men
came
out
she
got
up
eagerly
and
said
well
herr
dremmel
was
looking
very
solemn
more
entirely
solemn
than
she
had
ever
seen
him
almost
as
though
he
had
already
attained
to
that
crown
of
a
man
career
that
final
touch
of
all
that
last
gift
to
the
world
a
widow
and
orphans
the
doctor
face
was
a
careful
blank
well
said
ingeborg
again
greatly
alarmed
does
the
frau
pastor
also
wish
to
consult
me
asked
the
doctor
yes
i
did
but
it
does
really
matter
now
robert
herr
dremmel
was
putting
on
his
hat
very
firmly
and
going
towards
the
outer
door
without
saying
to
the
doctor
i
will
wait
for
you
outside
and
drive
you
home
ingeborg
he
said
not
looking
round
she
stared
after
him
is
he
very
ill
she
asked
turning
to
the
doctor
no
no
no
said
the
doctor
with
a
stress
on
it
but
and
you
look
very
well
too
pray
keep
so
it
is
not
necessary
judging
from
your
appearance
to
consult
me
further
i
will
conduct
you
to
your
carriage
but
said
ingeborg
who
found
herself
being
offered
an
arm
and
led
ceremoniously
after
robert
take
your
tonic
be
much
in
the
sun
and
alter
nothing
in
your
present
mode
of
life
said
the
doctor
but
robert
the
herr
pastor
enjoys
excellent
health
and
will
throw
himself
with
more
zeal
than
ever
into
his
work
then
why
and
the
frau
pastor
will
do
her
duty
yes
she
stopped
and
faced
him
yes
she
said
i
going
to
but
what
is
my
duty
my
dear
frau
pastor
there
is
only
one
left
you
have
discharged
all
the
others
your
one
duty
now
is
to
keep
well
in
body
and
mind
provide
your
two
children
with
a
capable
mother
and
your
husband
with
a
companion
possessed
of
the
intelligent
amiability
that
springs
from
good
health
but
robert
he
has
been
consulting
me
about
you
i
will
not
allow
you
to
turn
him
who
deserves
so
well
of
fate
into
that
unhappy
object
a
widower
oh
so
really
he
opened
the
front
door
yes
he
said
really
and
he
handed
her
up
into
the
seat
next
to
herr
dremmel
and
waved
them
off
on
their
homeward
journey
with
friendly
gestures
and
ingeborg
now
aware
that
the
real
cause
of
robert
preternatural
gloom
was
the
dread
of
losing
her
not
the
dread
of
leaving
her
was
deeply
touched
and
full
of
a
desire
to
express
her
appreciation
she
slid
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
spent
the
time
between
meuk
and
kökensee
earnestly
endeavouring
to
reassure
him
he
was
not
after
all
she
eagerly
explained
going
to
be
a
widower
he
bore
her
comforting
in
silence
chapter
xxiv
being
a
wise
man
herr
dremmel
lost
no
time
in
fidgeting
or
lamenting
over
the
inevitable
but
having
heard
the
doctor
summing
up
which
was
expressed
in
the
one
firm
word
repeated
over
and
over
again
like
a
series
of
blows
he
ruled
ingeborg
out
of
his
thoughts
as
a
wife
and
proceeded
to
train
himself
to
contemplate
her
as
a
sister
after
a
short
period
of
solemnity
for
he
was
not
sure
whether
the
training
would
not
be
tormenting
and
grievously
interfere
with
his
work
he
became
serene
again
for
to
his
satisfaction
he
found
it
easy
the
annoyance
of
having
supposed
his
wife
to
be
undutiful
the
pain
of
having
believed
her
to
be
deliberately
hurting
him
was
removed
he
was
faced
by
a
simple
fact
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
personalities
it
was
unfortunate
that
he
should
have
married
some
one
who
was
so
very
he
could
not
help
thinking
easily
killed
but
on
the
other
hand
he
was
less
dependent
on
domestic
joys
than
most
members
of
that
peculiarly
dependent
profession
the
church
for
he
had
his
brains
he
was
surprised
how
easy
once
he
recognised
its
inevitability
the
readjustment
of
the
relationship
was
how
easily
and
comfortably
he
forgot
she
seemed
to
drop
off
him
like
a
leaf
off
a
tree
in
autumn
a
light
thing
whose
detachment
from
the
great
remaining
strength
the
reaching
down
and
reaching
up
was
not
felt
his
mind
became
fitted
with
compartments
he
ceased
he
who
had
feared
these
things
might
come
to
be
an
obsession
so
much
as
to
see
that
she
was
pretty
that
she
was
soft
that
she
was
sweet
just
as
when
first
he
met
her
he
had
been
pleased
and
interested
to
find
he
could
fall
in
love
so
now
he
was
pleased
and
interested
to
find
when
it
was
a
matter
of
reason
and
necessity
he
could
fall
out
again
he
was
it
seemed
master
of
himself
passions
were
his
servants
and
came
only
as
it
were
when
he
rang
the
bell
all
one
had
to
do
then
was
not
to
ring
the
bell
with
satisfaction
he
observed
that
in
a
crisis
of
the
emotions
he
supposed
one
might
fairly
call
it
that
the
training
he
had
bestowed
on
his
reason
the
attention
he
had
given
it
from
his
youth
up
was
bearing
fruit
not
only
abundant
but
ripe
ingeborg
was
transformed
in
his
eyes
with
gratifying
rapidity
into
a
sister
a
gentle
maiden
sister
who
on
the
demise
of
his
wife
had
taken
over
the
housekeeping
and
when
in
the
evenings
he
bade
her
a
kind
he
found
himself
doing
it
quite
naturally
on
her
forehead
he
did
not
tell
her
she
had
become
a
sister
he
merely
rearranged
his
life
on
these
new
lines
and
he
did
as
the
doctor
had
predicted
throw
himself
into
his
work
with
more
zeal
than
ever
and
very
soon
was
once
again
being
pervaded
by
the
blessed
calms
the
serenities
the
unequalled
harmonies
that
are
the
portion
of
him
who
diligently
does
what
he
is
interested
in
but
ingeborg
who
had
neglected
her
reason
in
her
youth
and
whose
mind
consequently
was
strictly
undisciplined
spent
the
first
few
weeks
of
being
a
sister
in
a
condition
of
what
can
only
be
described
as
fluffing
about
she
took
hold
of
an
end
of
life
here
that
seemed
to
be
sticking
out
and
tugged
it
and
of
an
end
of
life
there
that
seemed
to
be
sticking
out
and
tugged
it
and
looked
at
them
inquiringly
and
let
them
go
again
she
did
not
quite
know
so
rich
in
liberty
had
she
suddenly
become
where
to
begin
there
were
so
many
ends
to
life
and
she
was
so
free
to
choose
that
she
blinked
a
little
here
were
her
days
swept
out
and
empty
for
her
at
last
here
she
was
able
to
say
magnificently
next
month
i
do
this
or
that
sure
of
her
months
sure
of
their
being
arrangeable
things
flexible
to
her
will
not
each
just
a
great
black
leaden
weight
holding
her
pinned
down
more
and
more
heavily
to
a
sofa
and
not
only
could
she
say
confidently
what
she
would
do
next
month
but
also
and
this
small
thing
like
many
other
small
things
of
the
sort
seemed
curiously
new
and
delightful
she
could
say
confidently
what
she
would
wear
all
those
dreary
in
which
she
had
trailed
through
the
seven
years
of
her
marriage
dark
garments
whose
sole
function
was
to
hide
were
given
to
ilse
her
first
servant
who
had
married
poverty
and
who
frugally
turned
them
into
trousers
of
assorted
shapes
for
her
husband
embittering
him
permanently
and
from
cupboards
she
got
out
small
neat
frocks
again
portions
of
her
unworn
tremendous
trousseau
short
things
washable
and
tidy
and
was
refreshed
into
respect
for
herself
as
a
decent
human
being
by
the
mere
putting
of
them
on
her
days
at
first
held
any
number
of
these
new
sensations
or
rather
recognitions
of
sensations
that
used
in
her
girlhood
to
be
a
matter
of
course
but
now
were
seen
to
be
extraordinarily
precious
she
spilt
over
like
a
brimming
chalice
of
gratefulness
for
the
great
common
things
of
life
sleep
hunger
power
to
move
about
freedom
from
fear
freedom
from
pain
her
returning
health
ran
through
her
veins
like
some
exquisite
delicate
wine
she
was
now
thirty
and
had
never
felt
so
young
wonderful
to
wake
up
in
the
morning
to
another
day
of
being
well
wonderful
being
allowed
to
be
alive
in
a
world
so
utterly
beautiful
so
full
of
opportunity
she
had
all
the
thankfulness
the
tender
giving
of
herself
up
confidently
to
joy
of
the
convalescent
she
was
happy
just
to
sit
on
fine
mornings
on
the
doorstep
in
the
sun
drinking
things
in
robertlet
and
ditti
had
never
been
so
much
kissed
rosa
and
the
cook
had
never
been
asked
so
often
after
their
ailing
mothers
kökensee
had
never
been
so
near
having
a
series
of
entertainments
arranged
for
it
the
very
cat
was
stroked
with
a
fresh
sense
of
fellowship
the
very
watchdog
at
one
time
suspected
of
surliness
was
loved
anew
and
when
she
passed
through
the
yard
she
did
not
fail
to
pause
and
gaze
with
a
sunny
determined
kindness
at
the
pig
but
though
she
passionately
wanted
to
make
everybody
and
everything
happy
in
return
for
robert
goodness
to
her
in
return
for
the
kind
way
she
thought
he
was
accepting
her
decision
and
not
once
after
that
first
outbreak
reproaching
her
she
had
been
anchored
too
long
to
one
definite
behaviour
not
to
feel
a
little
unsteady
when
first
let
loose
she
hovered
uncertainly
round
the
edges
of
life
fingering
them
trying
to
feel
the
point
where
she
could
best
catch
hold
and
climb
into
its
fulness
again
it
was
oddly
difficult
was
it
that
she
had
been
out
of
things
for
so
many
years
had
she
then
become
a
specialist
as
the
weeks
passed
and
the
first
sheer
delight
in
just
being
well
was
blunted
by
repetition
she
began
to
be
puzzled
everything
began
to
puzzle
her
herself
robert
the
children
the
servants
robert
puzzled
her
extremely
whenever
before
she
had
been
happy
a
cheerful
singing
thing
he
had
loved
her
she
knew
he
had
she
had
only
to
be
in
a
gay
mood
in
the
mood
that
recklessly
did
mind
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
but
sat
on
his
knee
and
insisted
on
his
listening
while
she
talked
half
in
earnest
and
half
amused
about
the
bigger
vaguer
windier
aspects
of
life
for
him
to
come
up
out
of
the
depths
of
his
meditations
and
laugh
and
pet
her
now
nothing
fetched
him
up
he
was
quite
unresponsive
he
seemed
beyond
her
reach
in
some
strange
retreat
where
she
could
not
get
at
him
she
had
never
felt
so
far
away
from
him
he
was
not
angry
evidently
he
was
quite
kind
she
could
not
guess
that
this
steady
unenthusiastic
kindness
was
the
natural
expression
of
a
fraternal
regard
but
he
does
me
she
said
to
herself
altogether
unaware
of
the
smallness
of
the
place
in
the
world
occupied
by
negative
persons
like
sisters
he
does
me
she
said
it
several
times
a
day
hugging
it
to
herself
as
the
weeks
went
on
in
much
the
same
way
that
a
coachman
growing
cold
on
his
box
hugs
his
chest
not
having
anything
else
to
hug
at
intervals
to
keep
his
circulation
going
and
particularly
she
said
it
on
her
way
up
to
the
attic
after
the
administration
of
the
kiss
in
spite
of
this
assurance
she
found
herself
presently
beginning
to
hesitate
before
she
spoke
to
him
or
touched
him
wondering
whether
he
would
like
it
she
tried
to
shake
off
these
increasing
timidities
and
once
or
twice
intrepidly
stroked
his
hair
but
his
head
bent
over
his
dinner
or
his
book
seemed
unconscious
that
she
was
doing
it
and
she
felt
unable
to
go
on
but
he
does
me
she
said
to
herself
it
was
not
long
before
she
perceived
definitely
that
she
had
ceased
to
amuse
him
and
the
moment
she
discovered
this
she
ceased
to
be
amusing
her
gaiety
went
out
like
a
light
but
he
does
me
she
still
said
to
herself
he
called
her
ingeborg
regularly
never
wife
or
little
one
and
it
soon
came
to
be
unthinkable
that
she
should
ever
have
been
his
treasure
snail
or
sheep
he
did
it
however
quite
kindly
with
no
trace
of
the
rebuke
it
used
invariably
to
contain
but
he
does
me
she
still
said
to
herself
puzzled
she
racked
her
brain
to
think
of
ways
to
please
him
and
tried
to
make
his
house
as
comfortably
perfect
for
him
as
possible
performing
every
duty
she
could
find
or
invent
with
a
thoroughness
that
by
eleven
in
the
morning
had
exhausted
the
supply
herr
dremmel
however
was
not
accessible
by
ways
of
order
and
good
food
he
had
never
noticed
their
absence
and
he
did
not
now
notice
their
presence
she
saw
after
a
while
herself
that
his
sum
of
happiness
was
not
in
the
least
increased
by
them
how
could
she
make
him
happy
then
what
could
she
do
to
make
his
life
the
brightest
serene
thing
it
was
a
shock
to
her
an
immense
and
shattering
surprise
the
day
she
realised
that
all
this
time
he
was
in
fact
being
happy
she
walked
in
the
garden
long
that
day
staring
hard
at
this
new
perception
pondering
astonished
but
he
does
she
began
and
stopped
did
he
what
was
the
good
of
saying
he
did
if
he
did
was
everything
with
him
and
perhaps
with
other
husbands
she
knew
so
little
about
husbands
bound
up
with
parenthood
was
it
true
what
he
said
to
her
the
day
she
begged
him
to
be
friends
that
a
husband
and
wife
could
never
be
friends
she
felt
so
entirely
able
to
love
robert
to
love
him
tenderly
and
deeply
without
perpetually
being
somebody
mother
perhaps
wives
could
be
friends
and
husbands
could
she
wished
she
knew
more
about
these
things
she
felt
she
did
not
rightly
understand
and
suspected
walking
up
and
down
the
damp
october
garden
that
being
a
daughter
was
an
inefficient
preparation
for
being
anybody
wife
it
kept
one
mind
muffled
you
were
brought
up
not
to
look
if
you
wanted
to
see
you
had
to
be
furtive
and
peep
at
life
over
the
edge
as
it
were
of
your
which
made
you
feel
wicked
and
did
give
you
any
sort
of
a
view
all
bishops
daughters
she
said
to
herself
walking
fast
for
her
thoughts
became
tumultuous
on
this
subject
ought
to
be
maiden
ladies
or
if
they
could
manage
that
as
paul
would
say
they
should
at
least
only
marry
more
bishops
not
curates
not
vicars
not
mysterious
elusivenesses
like
german
pastors
but
bishops
people
they
were
used
to
people
they
understood
continuations
second
volumes
sequels
aprons
curates
might
have
convulsive
moments
that
would
worry
souls
blanched
white
by
the
keeping
out
of
the
light
souls
like
celery
no
whiter
than
anybody
else
if
left
properly
to
themselves
but
blanched
by
a
continual
banking
up
round
them
of
episcopal
mould
and
even
a
vicar
might
conceivably
sometimes
be
headlong
while
as
for
a
german
pastor
she
flung
out
her
hands
well
robert
was
not
headlong
no
one
could
accuse
him
of
anything
but
the
most
steady
sequence
in
his
steps
but
he
was
she
thought
not
having
the
clue
to
herr
dremmel
conduct
incomprehensible
with
the
simple
faith
of
women
that
faith
that
holds
out
against
so
many
enlightenments
and
whose
artless
mainspring
is
vanity
she
had
believed
quite
firmly
that
every
sweet
and
admiring
assurance
he
had
ever
given
her
would
go
on
changelessly
and
indefinitely
holding
good
she
had
believed
she
knew
and
understood
him
better
than
he
did
himself
and
that
at
any
time
she
wanted
to
she
had
only
to
reach
out
her
hand
to
be
able
to
help
herself
to
more
of
his
love
this
faith
in
herself
and
in
her
power
if
she
really
wished
to
charm
him
she
called
having
faith
in
him
it
took
six
weeks
of
steadily
continued
mild
indifference
on
herr
dremmel
part
of
placid
imperviousness
to
all
approaches
of
an
affectionate
nature
of
the
most
obvious
keen
relish
in
his
work
keener
than
he
had
yet
shown
to
reveal
the
truth
at
last
to
her
and
greatly
was
she
astonished
he
was
happy
and
he
was
happy
without
her
and
that
said
ingeborg
unable
to
resist
the
conclusion
pressed
upon
her
is
love
she
stopped
a
moment
beneath
the
gently
dripping
trees
and
took
off
her
knitted
cap
and
shook
it
dry
for
she
had
inadvertently
brushed
against
an
overhanging
branch
on
which
last
summer
leaves
still
wetly
clung
she
pulled
out
her
handkerchief
and
rubbed
her
cap
thoughtfully
it
had
been
raining
all
the
morning
and
now
late
in
the
afternoon
the
garden
was
a
quiet
grey
place
of
fallen
leaves
and
gathering
dusk
and
occasional
small
shakings
of
wet
off
the
trees
when
a
silent
bird
perched
on
the
sodden
branches
some
drops
fell
on
her
bare
head
while
she
was
drying
her
cap
she
put
up
her
hand
mechanically
and
rubbed
them
off
she
stood
wiping
her
cap
long
after
it
was
dry
absorbed
in
thought
i
do
know
what
it
is
she
said
presently
half
aloud
but
i
do
know
what
it
is
she
put
on
her
cap
again
pulling
it
over
her
ears
with
both
hands
and
much
care
and
staring
while
she
did
it
at
a
slug
in
the
path
in
front
of
her
and
what
it
is
she
said
after
another
interval
shaking
her
head
and
screwing
up
her
face
into
an
expression
of
profoundest
negation
is
love
she
added
deeply
astonished
then
with
a
flash
of
insight
it
because
he
works
then
with
a
quick
desire
to
cover
up
the
wound
to
her
vanity
if
he
did
get
lost
in
his
work
he
he
loves
me
it
only
that
he
then
with
a
white
flare
of
candour
he
a
bigger
thing
than
i
am
then
with
the
old
eagerness
to
help
so
it
my
business
to
see
that
he
can
be
big
in
happy
peace
then
remembrance
smiting
her
with
its
flat
cold
hand
but
he
happy
then
so
where
do
i
come
in
then
with
a
great
frank
acceptance
of
the
truth
i
do
come
in
then
swept
by
swift
indignant
honesty
why
should
i
to
come
in
what
is
all
this
coming
in
oh
she
stamped
her
foot
the
simple
fact
the
naked
fact
when
i
pulled
all
the
silly
clothes
off
is
that
i
only
want
him
to
be
happy
if
it
i
who
make
him
happy
and
nothing
but
a
i
just
a
she
twisted
round
on
her
heels
her
arms
flung
out
in
search
of
the
exact
raw
word
i
nothing
but
just
a
common
tyrant
at
her
condition
can
best
though
yet
imperfectly
be
described
as
chastened
chapter
xxv
nevertheless
though
she
tried
to
face
it
squarely
and
help
herself
by
indignation
at
her
own
selfish
vanity
she
felt
a
great
emptiness
round
her
a
great
chill
it
was
impossible
to
get
used
all
at
once
to
this
new
knowledge
so
astonishing
after
seven
years
of
conviction
that
one
was
loved
and
so
astonishing
when
one
remembered
that
as
recently
as
august
one
could
positively
count
the
days
just
coming
home
again
after
an
absence
had
drawn
forth
from
robert
any
number
of
manifestations
of
it
it
had
the
suddenness
and
completeness
of
the
switching
off
of
light
a
second
before
one
was
illuminated
another
second
and
one
was
groping
in
the
dark
for
she
did
grope
she
was
groping
for
reasons
it
seemed
for
a
long
time
so
incredible
that
her
entire
importance
and
interest
as
a
human
being
should
depend
on
whether
she
was
or
was
not
what
he
called
a
true
wife
that
she
preferred
to
go
on
groping
rather
than
take
hold
of
this
as
an
explanation
she
had
been
so
sure
of
robert
she
had
been
so
familiar
with
him
and
unafraid
when
she
thought
of
her
days
at
home
of
her
abject
fear
of
her
father
of
her
insignificance
she
felt
that
robert
love
and
admiration
had
lifted
her
up
from
being
a
creeping
thing
to
being
a
creature
with
quite
bright
brave
wings
he
had
come
suddenly
into
her
life
and
told
her
she
was
a
and
behold
she
became
a
and
now
he
did
think
her
even
that
any
more
he
had
dropped
her
again
and
she
was
already
falling
back
into
the
old
state
of
timidity
towards
the
man
in
the
house
she
turned
to
the
children
and
the
housekeeping
and
to
a
search
for
something
she
could
do
in
the
parish
so
that
at
least
while
she
was
making
efforts
to
clear
her
confusion
about
robert
she
might
not
be
wasting
time
if
she
was
no
use
to
him
she
might
be
of
use
to
the
less
independent
she
was
entirely
humble
at
this
moment
and
would
have
thanked
a
dog
if
it
had
been
so
kind
as
to
allow
her
to
persuade
it
to
wag
its
tail
it
had
always
been
her
hope
throughout
each
of
her
illnesses
that
presently
when
that
one
was
over
she
would
get
up
and
begin
to
do
good
and
now
here
she
was
finally
up
with
two
children
who
had
not
yet
had
much
mother
two
servants
whose
lives
might
perhaps
be
made
more
interesting
a
whole
field
outside
her
gates
for
practise
in
deeds
of
mercy
and
enormous
tracts
of
time
on
her
hands
all
she
had
to
do
was
to
begin
but
it
was
rather
like
an
resurrection
things
had
filled
up
everybody
seemed
used
to
being
left
alone
and
such
a
thing
as
so
familiar
to
a
person
bred
in
redchester
was
unknown
in
east
prussia
the
wife
of
a
country
pastor
had
as
many
duties
in
her
own
house
as
one
woman
could
perform
in
a
day
and
nobody
expected
to
see
her
going
about
into
other
houses
consoling
and
alleviating
also
the
peasants
thought
why
should
one
be
consoled
and
alleviated
the
social
difference
between
the
peasant
and
the
pastor
was
so
small
and
rested
so
often
only
on
education
that
it
would
have
appeared
equally
natural
if
the
thing
could
from
any
point
of
view
have
been
made
natural
for
the
wife
of
the
peasant
to
go
and
console
and
alleviate
the
parsonage
who
wanted
sympathy
in
kökensee
certainly
not
the
men
and
the
women
were
too
busy
with
family
cares
those
many
crushing
cares
that
yet
kept
them
interested
and
alive
to
have
time
for
consolations
and
those
with
most
cares
most
children
who
died
most
internal
complaints
most
gloom
and
weariness
achieved
just
because
of
these
things
almost
as
much
distinction
and
popularity
in
the
village
as
those
with
most
money
ingeborg
herself
was
popular
so
long
as
her
children
were
drowned
out
of
punts
or
died
of
mumps
or
were
stillborn
but
now
that
nothing
happened
to
her
and
she
went
about
after
having
had
six
of
them
still
straight
and
slender
kökensee
regarded
her
coldly
and
with
distrust
doing
nothing
for
anybody
on
a
sofa
in
an
untidy
black
she
had
been
respected
trim
and
anxious
to
be
of
use
she
was
disapproved
of
when
she
went
round
to
try
to
interest
the
women
in
the
getting
up
of
little
gatherings
that
were
to
brighten
the
parish
once
a
fortnight
during
the
winter
months
they
shook
their
heads
over
their
washtubs
and
told
each
other
after
she
had
gone
that
it
was
because
she
kept
two
servants
who
did
not
do
their
own
work
they
said
shaking
their
heads
with
many
were
sure
to
get
into
mischief
all
they
asked
of
the
pastor
wife
was
that
she
should
attend
to
her
own
business
and
let
them
attend
to
theirs
they
did
not
walk
into
her
why
should
she
walk
into
theirs
they
did
not
want
to
brighten
her
winter
why
should
she
want
to
brighten
theirs
she
should
take
example
from
her
husband
they
said
who
never
visited
anybody
but
a
frau
who
kept
two
servants
and
who
after
six
children
still
wore
skirts
shorter
than
a
confirmation
candidate
ja
das
kommt
and
things
had
filled
up
at
home
rosa
and
the
cook
had
been
used
so
long
to
managing
alone
and
were
so
completely
obsessed
by
the
idea
that
the
frau
pastor
was
half
dead
and
that
her
one
real
function
was
to
lie
down
that
they
regarded
her
suddenly
frequent
appearances
in
the
kitchen
with
the
uneasiness
and
discomfort
with
which
they
would
have
regarded
the
appearances
of
a
ghost
no
more
than
if
she
had
been
a
ghost
did
they
know
what
to
do
with
her
she
did
not
seem
real
separated
from
her
bedroom
and
her
they
could
not
work
with
her
she
would
make
them
jump
when
on
looking
up
they
saw
her
in
their
midst
having
come
in
unheard
with
her
strange
lightness
of
movement
their
nerves
were
shaken
when
they
discovered
her
on
her
knees
in
odd
corners
of
the
house
doing
things
with
dusters
to
see
her
prodding
potatoes
over
the
fire
and
weighing
meat
and
approaching
onions
familiarly
made
them
creep
it
was
like
some
dreadful
miracle
it
was
like
said
rosa
whispering
being
obliged
to
cook
dinners
and
make
beds
with
the
help
of
side
by
side
with
with
what
then
cried
the
cook
pretending
courage
but
catching
fear
from
rosa
face
einem
whispered
rosa
behind
her
hand
the
cook
shrieked
they
did
not
however
give
notice
being
good
girls
and
prepared
to
bear
much
till
they
saw
their
names
in
red
ink
in
one
of
the
squares
ruled
on
a
sheet
of
paper
the
frau
pastor
pinned
up
on
the
wall
above
her
for
a
day
or
two
they
were
filled
with
nameless
horror
because
the
ink
was
red
then
when
they
discovered
what
the
numbers
against
the
square
meant
the
horror
was
swept
away
in
indignation
for
it
was
the
hour
in
the
afternoon
in
which
they
usually
mended
or
knitted
and
gossiped
together
and
it
appeared
that
the
frau
pastor
intended
to
come
and
sit
with
them
during
this
hour
and
read
aloud
nice
books
are
so
so
nice
said
ingeborg
explaining
her
idea
you
think
you
like
nice
books
she
faltered
a
little
because
of
the
expression
on
their
faces
there
is
the
pig
said
the
cook
desperately
the
pig
it
has
to
be
fed
between
three
and
four
oh
but
we
not
going
to
mind
things
like
said
ingeborg
with
a
slightly
laboured
brightness
the
next
day
they
gave
notice
but
the
plan
pinned
up
in
the
parlour
had
nothing
except
during
this
one
hour
to
do
with
rosa
and
the
cook
it
had
been
drawn
up
solely
on
behalf
of
robertlet
and
ditti
ingeborg
had
pored
over
it
for
days
making
careful
squares
with
a
ruler
and
doing
all
the
principal
words
in
red
ink
her
hair
touzled
by
the
stresses
of
thinking
out
and
her
cheeks
flushed
the
winter
was
upon
them
and
already
rain
and
gales
made
being
out
of
doors
impossible
except
for
one
daily
courageous
trudge
after
dinner
with
the
children
in
waterproofs
and
goloshes
and
she
thought
that
with
a
little
arranging
she
might
shorten
and
brighten
the
long
months
to
the
spring
the
children
were
so
passive
they
seemed
hardly
conscious
she
thought
of
the
world
round
them
would
they
enjoy
themselves
more
if
they
could
be
taught
to
look
at
things
their
resemblance
to
the
elder
frau
dremmel
was
remarkable
it
is
true
but
of
course
only
superficial
why
they
were
apathetic
was
because
they
had
had
so
little
mother
in
their
lives
she
had
only
been
able
to
teach
them
their
prayers
and
their
grace
and
beyond
that
had
had
to
leave
them
to
god
now
however
she
could
take
over
her
charge
again
and
teach
them
things
that
would
make
them
lissom
quick
interested
and
gay
what
would
make
robertlet
and
ditti
lissom
quick
interested
and
gay
she
pored
profoundly
over
this
question
and
was
steeped
in
red
ink
and
with
the
end
of
her
pen
bitten
off
and
the
floor
white
with
plans
before
she
had
answered
it
at
the
end
of
the
winter
she
thought
she
could
not
have
answered
it
right
there
was
something
wrong
with
education
the
children
had
been
immensely
patient
they
had
borne
immensely
with
their
mother
yet
by
the
end
of
a
whole
winter
application
of
the
plan
they
knew
only
how
cats
and
dogs
were
spelt
and
the
sole
wonder
that
they
felt
after
six
months
parental
effort
to
stir
them
to
that
important
preliminary
to
knowledge
was
a
dim
surprise
that
such
familiar
beasts
should
need
spelling
it
was
very
unfortunate
but
they
could
not
be
got
for
instance
to
like
the
heavenly
bodies
useless
for
their
mother
to
press
them
upon
their
notice
on
clear
evenings
when
all
the
sky
was
from
first
to
last
they
saw
nothing
in
the
sunsets
that
lit
the
white
winter
world
into
a
vast
cave
of
colour
except
a
sign
that
it
must
be
not
once
could
they
be
induced
to
shudder
at
the
thought
on
great
starry
nights
of
infinite
space
they
were
unmoved
by
the
information
that
they
were
being
hurled
at
an
incredible
speed
through
it
and
they
did
mind
the
moon
being
all
those
miles
away
in
the
dancing
class
it
was
ingeborg
who
danced
in
the
gymnastic
class
it
was
she
who
grew
lissom
the
and
german
owing
to
an
absence
in
robertlet
and
ditti
of
any
of
the
ingredients
of
chat
was
a
monologue
and
for
the
course
on
to
insects
collected
in
the
it
was
ingeborg
who
caught
the
flies
they
were
however
very
good
nothing
to
which
they
were
subjected
altered
that
when
their
mother
in
spite
of
discouragements
went
on
bravely
so
did
they
when
out
of
doors
she
snowballed
them
they
stood
patiently
till
she
had
done
she
showed
them
how
to
make
a
snow
man
and
they
did
not
complain
she
gave
them
little
sledges
at
christmas
and
explained
the
emotions
to
be
extracted
from
these
objects
by
sliding
on
them
swiftly
down
slopes
and
they
bore
her
no
when
having
slid
they
fell
off
but
quietly
preferred
the
level
garden
paths
and
drew
each
other
in
turn
on
one
sledge
up
and
down
them
while
their
mother
on
the
other
sledge
did
the
sorts
of
things
they
had
come
to
expect
from
mothers
and
kept
on
disappearing
over
the
brink
of
the
slope
to
the
frozen
lake
head
first
and
face
downward
it
very
thought
ingeborg
sometimes
as
the
winter
dragged
on
there
she
was
heavy
with
facts
about
flies
and
stars
and
distances
extracted
in
the
evenings
during
her
preparation
hours
from
the
encyclopædia
britannica
which
had
been
procured
from
london
for
the
purpose
the
parsonage
groaned
beneath
it
and
longing
to
unload
them
and
she
was
not
able
to
because
the
two
vessels
which
ought
to
have
received
them
were
fitted
so
impenetrably
with
lids
they
seemed
to
grow
if
anything
more
lidded
quieter
and
quieter
the
hour
at
the
end
of
the
day
marked
on
the
plan
lap
an
hour
she
had
thought
might
easily
become
beautiful
something
her
children
would
remember
years
hence
which
was
to
have
been
all
white
intimacy
with
kisses
and
talks
about
angels
and
the
best
and
quickest
ways
of
getting
to
heaven
while
robertlet
sat
in
the
lap
on
mondays
wednesdays
and
fridays
and
ditti
sat
in
it
on
tuesdays
thursdays
and
saturdays
there
being
scarcity
in
laps
was
from
the
beginning
an
hour
of
for
the
children
of
staring
sleepily
into
the
glow
of
the
stove
resting
while
they
waited
for
what
their
mother
would
do
or
say
next
ingeborg
was
inclined
to
be
disheartened
at
this
hour
it
was
the
last
one
of
the
children
day
and
the
day
had
been
long
there
was
the
firelight
the
mother
lap
and
knee
the
mother
herself
ready
to
kiss
and
be
confided
in
and
more
than
ready
to
confide
in
her
turn
those
discoveries
she
had
made
in
the
regions
of
science
and
nothing
happened
robertlet
and
ditti
either
stared
fixedly
at
the
glow
from
the
open
stove
door
or
at
ingeborg
herself
but
whichever
they
stared
at
they
did
it
in
silence
what
are
you
thinking
of
she
would
ask
them
sometimes
disturbing
their
dreamless
dream
their
happy
freedom
from
thought
and
then
together
they
would
answer
nothing
no
but
tell
me
really
you
ca
think
of
nothing
impossible
nothing
is
she
floundered
is
always
but
the
next
time
she
asked
the
same
question
they
answered
with
one
voice
just
as
before
nothing
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
perhaps
they
were
having
too
much
mother
this
also
happened
in
the
hour
called
lap
a
mother
she
reflected
both
her
arms
round
her
children
according
to
plan
must
often
be
rather
a
nuisance
she
looked
down
with
a
new
sympathy
at
ditti
head
reposing
also
according
to
plan
on
her
shoulder
especially
if
she
a
devoted
mother
she
laid
her
cheek
on
the
black
smooth
hair
parted
and
pigtailed
and
as
unlike
robert
fair
furry
stuff
or
her
own
as
it
was
like
the
elder
frau
dremmel
a
devoted
mother
continued
ingeborg
to
herself
her
eyes
on
the
glowing
heart
of
the
stove
and
her
cheek
on
ditti
head
is
one
who
gives
up
all
her
time
to
trying
to
make
her
children
different
a
devoted
mother
she
added
after
a
pause
in
which
she
had
faced
her
conscience
how
dreadful
she
thought
she
began
to
kiss
ditti
head
very
softly
how
too
dreadful
to
be
in
the
power
of
somebody
different
of
somebody
quick
if
you
not
quick
or
dull
if
you
not
dull
and
anyhow
so
old
so
very
old
compared
to
you
and
have
to
be
made
like
her
how
would
i
like
being
in
my
power
with
years
and
years
for
her
to
work
at
forcing
me
to
be
what
she
think
i
ought
to
be
and
what
she
think
i
ought
to
be
would
be
herself
what
she
tries
to
be
of
course
you
ca
think
outside
yourself
she
drew
the
children
tighter
you
little
things
she
exclaimed
aloud
suddenly
overcome
by
the
vision
of
what
it
must
be
like
to
have
to
put
up
with
a
person
so
fundamentally
alien
through
a
whole
winter
and
she
kissed
them
one
after
the
other
holding
their
faces
close
to
hers
with
her
hands
against
their
cheeks
in
a
passion
of
apology
even
to
that
exclamation
a
quite
new
one
in
a
quite
new
voice
they
said
nothing
but
waited
patiently
for
what
would
no
doubt
happen
next
chapter
xxvi
what
happened
next
was
that
they
went
to
school
just
as
ingeborg
was
beginning
to
ask
herself
rather
shy
questions
for
she
was
very
full
of
respects
about
the
value
of
education
and
the
claims
of
free
development
the
state
stepped
in
and
swept
robertlet
and
ditti
away
from
her
into
its
competent
keeping
in
an
instant
so
it
seemed
to
her
afterward
when
in
the
empty
house
she
had
nothing
to
do
but
put
away
their
traces
she
was
bereft
you
never
told
me
is
what
happens
to
mothers
she
said
to
herr
dremmel
the
day
the
brief
order
from
the
chief
inspector
of
schools
arrived
herr
dremmel
who
was
annoyed
that
he
should
have
forgotten
his
parental
and
civic
duties
and
still
more
annoyed
it
being
april
and
his
fields
needing
much
attention
as
a
infant
or
a
young
woman
one
wishes
impelled
by
amorous
motives
to
marry
that
there
should
be
parental
and
civic
duties
to
forget
was
short
with
her
every
german
of
six
has
to
be
educated
he
said
but
they
being
educated
said
ingeborg
her
mind
weighted
with
all
she
herself
had
learned
he
waved
her
aside
but
robert
my
children
surely
there
some
way
of
educating
them
besides
sending
them
away
from
me
he
continued
to
wave
her
aside
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
the
children
had
to
go
and
they
went
of
the
alternatives
their
being
taught
at
home
by
a
person
with
government
certificates
or
attending
the
village
school
herr
dremmel
would
not
hear
he
was
having
differences
of
a
personal
nature
with
the
village
schoolmaster
who
refused
with
a
steadiness
that
annoyed
herr
dremmel
to
recognise
that
he
was
a
while
herr
dremmel
held
and
patiently
explained
that
a
person
who
is
born
a
should
be
simple
and
frank
about
it
and
not
persist
in
behaving
as
if
he
were
not
one
and
as
for
a
teacher
in
the
house
that
was
altogether
impossible
because
there
was
no
room
there
the
laboratory
said
ingeborg
recklessly
to
whom
anything
seemed
better
than
letting
her
children
go
the
lab
only
to
sleep
in
she
eagerly
explained
just
sleep
in
you
know
the
teacher
need
be
there
at
all
in
the
daytime
for
instance
ingeborg
began
herr
dremmel
then
he
thought
better
of
it
and
merely
held
out
his
cup
for
more
tea
women
were
really
much
to
be
pitied
their
entire
inability
to
reach
even
an
elementary
conception
of
values
the
children
went
to
school
in
meuk
they
lodged
with
their
grandmother
and
were
to
come
home
on
those
vague
sundays
when
the
weather
was
good
and
herr
dremmel
did
not
require
the
horses
ingeborg
could
not
believe
in
such
a
complete
sweep
out
of
her
life
she
loved
robertlet
and
ditti
with
an
extreme
and
odd
tenderness
there
was
in
it
a
passionate
desire
to
protect
it
was
the
love
sometimes
found
in
those
who
have
to
do
all
the
loving
by
themselves
it
was
an
acute
and
quivering
thing
after
her
experiences
in
the
winter
she
had
doubts
whether
education
at
present
was
what
they
wanted
it
was
not
school
they
wanted
she
thought
but
to
run
wild
she
knew
it
would
have
been
perhaps
difficult
to
get
them
to
run
in
this
manner
but
thought
if
she
had
had
them
a
little
longer
and
had
thoroughly
revised
her
plan
purging
it
of
science
and
filling
them
up
instead
with
different
forms
of
wildness
she
might
eventually
have
induced
them
to
there
could
have
been
a
carefully
graduated
course
in
wildness
she
thought
beginning
quietly
with
weeding
paths
and
going
on
by
steps
of
abandonment
to
and
midnight
raids
on
apples
and
while
she
wandered
about
the
deserted
garden
and
was
desolate
robertlet
and
ditti
safe
in
their
grandmother
house
were
having
the
most
beautiful
dumplings
every
day
for
dinner
that
seemed
to
fit
into
each
part
of
them
as
warmly
and
neatly
as
though
they
were
bits
of
their
own
bodies
come
back
after
having
been
artificially
separated
to
fill
them
with
a
delicious
hot
contentment
and
their
grandmother
was
saying
to
them
at
regular
intervals
with
a
raised
forefinger
my
children
never
forget
that
you
are
germans
there
was
now
nothing
left
for
ingeborg
but
as
she
told
herr
dremmel
the
first
sunday
robertlet
and
ditti
had
been
coming
home
and
then
for
some
obscure
reason
did
not
come
thrusting
the
information
tactlessly
at
between
his
attention
and
his
book
her
own
inside
after
all
she
said
as
usual
quite
suddenly
breaking
a
valuable
silence
there
still
me
herr
dremmel
said
nothing
for
it
was
one
of
those
statements
of
fact
that
luckily
do
not
require
an
answer
nobody
said
ingeborg
throwing
her
head
back
a
little
can
take
that
away
herr
dremmel
said
nothing
to
that
either
chiefly
because
he
did
not
want
to
he
had
no
time
nor
desire
to
guess
at
meanings
which
were
no
doubt
after
all
not
there
whatever
happens
she
said
i
still
got
my
own
inside
ingeborg
said
herr
dremmel
i
will
not
ask
you
what
you
mean
in
case
you
should
tell
me
there
was
a
drought
going
on
and
herr
dremmel
who
justly
prided
himself
on
his
sweetness
of
temper
was
not
as
patient
as
usual
so
ingeborg
silenced
went
into
the
garden
where
the
drought
was
making
the
world
glow
and
shimmer
and
reflected
that
on
the
object
she
called
her
inside
alone
now
depended
her
happiness
it
was
useless
to
depend
on
others
it
was
useless
to
depend
as
she
had
done
in
her
ridiculous
vanity
on
others
depending
on
her
after
all
each
year
had
a
may
in
it
and
the
birds
sang
she
would
send
away
the
extra
servant
and
do
the
work
herself
as
she
used
to
at
first
she
would
begin
again
to
develop
her
intelligence
and
write
that
evening
to
london
for
the
something
she
remembered
had
warmed
and
quickened
her
all
those
years
ago
after
her
meeting
with
ingram
was
it
the
she
would
make
plans
she
would
draw
up
plans
in
red
ink
there
were
a
thousand
things
she
might
study
there
were
languages
she
walked
up
and
down
the
garden
if
she
let
herself
be
beaten
back
this
time
into
neglect
of
herself
and
indifference
she
would
be
done
for
there
was
no
one
to
save
her
she
would
lapse
and
lapse
and
not
into
fatnesses
and
peace
like
other
women
in
germany
lopped
of
their
children
and
of
a
class
above
the
class
that
stood
at
that
instrument
of
salvation
its
own
washtub
not
into
afternoon
slumbers
and
benevolences
of
a
woolly
nature
that
kept
one
hand
knitting
while
one
brains
went
to
sleep
till
presently
one
was
dead
but
into
something
fretful
and
nipped
with
a
little
shrivelled
skinny
steadily
dwindling
mind
her
eyes
grew
very
wide
at
this
dreadful
picture
now
was
the
moment
she
thought
turning
away
from
it
quickly
now
that
there
had
come
this
pause
in
her
life
to
go
over
to
england
for
a
visit
and
see
her
relations
and
talk
and
come
back
refreshed
to
a
new
chapter
of
existence
in
kökensee
she
had
not
been
out
of
kökensee
except
to
zoppot
since
her
marriage
and
her
throat
tightened
at
the
thought
of
england
but
the
bishop
had
never
forgiven
her
marriage
and
her
having
had
six
children
had
also
it
seemed
from
her
mother
letters
when
there
used
to
be
letters
made
an
unfavourable
impression
on
him
it
had
in
fact
upset
him
he
had
considered
such
conduct
too
distinctively
german
to
be
passed
over
and
when
she
added
to
the
error
in
taste
of
having
had
them
the
further
error
or
rather
negligence
it
must
have
been
criminal
thought
the
bishop
of
not
being
able
to
keep
them
alive
the
palace
after
having
four
times
with
an
increasing
severity
condoled
withdrew
into
a
disapproval
so
profound
that
it
could
only
express
itself
adequately
by
silence
and
a
stay
with
judith
was
out
of
the
question
one
had
for
a
stay
with
judith
to
have
clothes
and
she
had
no
clothes
at
least
none
newer
than
eight
years
old
her
immense
unworn
trousseau
dogged
her
through
the
years
for
judith
gave
many
parties
at
the
master
lodge
brilliant
gatherings
her
mother
called
them
in
her
rare
letters
where
london
come
down
on
purpose
and
expressed
in
prime
and
other
ministers
as
well
as
in
the
fine
flower
of
the
aristocracy
and
a
few
selected
fragrances
from
the
world
of
literature
and
art
once
her
mother
wrote
that
ingram
the
great
painter
had
been
at
the
last
party
and
was
so
much
enslaved
by
judith
loveliness
that
he
had
asked
as
a
favour
to
be
allowed
to
paint
her
sat
at
judith
feet
no
england
was
not
for
her
her
place
was
in
kökensee
and
her
business
now
was
to
do
what
her
governesses
used
to
call
improve
her
mind
perhaps
if
she
improved
it
enough
robert
would
talk
to
her
again
sometimes
and
this
time
not
on
the
little
treasure
basis
but
on
the
solid
one
of
intellectual
companionship
might
she
not
end
by
being
a
real
helpmeet
to
him
somebody
who
would
gradually
learn
to
be
quiet
and
analytical
and
artful
with
grains
she
went
indoors
and
wrote
then
and
there
to
london
renewing
the
subscriptions
to
the
and
the
rest
she
asked
for
a
catalogue
of
the
newest
publications
that
were
not
novels
her
determination
was
too
serious
just
then
for
novels
ordered
herbert
spencer
first
principles
for
she
felt
she
would
like
to
have
some
principles
especially
first
ones
and
said
she
would
be
glad
of
any
little
hint
the
could
give
her
as
to
what
he
thought
a
married
lady
ought
to
know
and
she
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
and
the
two
following
days
laying
the
foundations
of
intellectual
companionship
by
looking
up
the
article
in
the
encyclopædia
britannica
and
paraphrasing
it
into
conversational
observations
that
sounded
to
her
so
clever
when
she
tried
them
on
herr
dremmel
three
days
later
at
that
she
was
astonished
herself
she
was
still
more
astonished
when
herr
dremmel
having
listened
remarked
that
her
facts
were
wrong
but
they
ca
she
began
then
broke
off
feeling
the
awkwardness
of
a
position
in
which
one
was
unable
to
argue
without
at
once
revealing
the
encyclopædia
chapter
xxvii
this
was
in
may
by
the
end
of
the
following
may
ingeborg
had
read
so
much
that
she
felt
quite
uncomfortable
it
had
been
a
fine
confused
reading
in
which
ruskin
jostled
roger
fry
and
shelley
lingered
as
it
were
in
the
lap
of
masefield
the
who
must
have
lived
chiefly
a
great
many
years
before
steadily
sent
her
mid
early
and
literature
and
she
ordering
on
her
own
account
books
advertised
in
the
weekly
papers
found
herself
as
a
result
one
day
in
the
placid
arms
of
the
lake
poets
and
the
next
being
disciplined
by
marinetti
one
day
ambling
unconcernedly
with
lamb
and
the
next
caught
in
the
exquisite
intricacies
of
henry
james
she
read
books
of
travel
she
learned
poetry
by
heart
she
grew
skilful
at
combining
her
studies
with
her
cooking
and
propping
up
keats
on
the
dresser
could
run
to
him
for
a
fresh
line
in
the
very
middle
of
the
pudding
almost
without
the
pudding
minding
and
since
she
loved
to
hear
the
beautiful
words
she
learned
aloud
and
the
kitchen
was
full
of
a
pleasant
buzzing
a
murmurous
sound
of
sonnets
as
well
as
flies
to
which
the
servant
got
used
in
time
but
though
she
set
about
this
new
life
with
solemnity
for
was
she
not
a
lopped
and
lonely
woman
whose
husband
had
left
off
loving
her
and
whose
children
had
been
taken
away
cheerfulness
kept
on
creeping
in
the
chief
obstacle
to
any
sort
of
continued
gloom
was
that
there
was
a
morning
to
every
day
also
she
had
enthusiasms
those
most
uplifting
and
outlifting
from
oneself
of
spiritual
attitudes
and
developed
a
pretty
talent
for
tingling
she
would
tingle
on
the
least
provocation
with
joy
over
a
poem
with
admiration
over
the
description
of
a
picture
and
thrilled
and
quivered
with
response
to
tales
of
beauty
of
the
beauty
of
the
cathedrals
in
france
miracles
of
coloured
glass
held
together
delicately
by
stone
blown
together
she
could
only
think
from
the
descriptions
in
their
exquisite
fragility
by
the
breath
of
god
rather
than
built
up
slowly
by
men
hands
of
the
beauty
of
places
the
lagoons
round
venice
at
sunrise
the
desert
toward
evening
of
the
beauty
of
love
faithful
splendid
equal
love
of
all
the
beauty
men
made
with
their
hands
little
spuddy
things
running
over
dead
stuff
blocks
of
stone
bits
of
glass
and
canvas
fashioning
and
fashioning
till
at
last
there
was
the
vision
pulled
out
of
a
brain
and
caught
forever
into
the
glory
of
line
and
colour
she
longed
to
talk
about
the
wonderful
and
stirring
and
vivid
things
life
outside
kökensee
seemed
to
flash
with
what
must
it
be
like
to
talk
to
people
who
knew
and
had
seen
what
could
it
be
like
to
see
for
oneself
to
travel
to
go
to
france
and
its
cathedrals
to
go
to
italy
in
the
when
the
jewels
of
the
world
could
be
looked
at
in
a
setting
of
clear
skies
and
generous
flowers
or
in
autumn
when
kökensee
was
grey
and
tortured
with
rainstorms
to
go
away
there
into
serenity
to
where
the
sun
burned
the
chestnuts
golden
all
day
long
and
the
air
smelt
of
ripened
grapes
and
she
had
only
seen
the
rigi
well
that
was
something
and
it
seemed
somehow
appropriate
for
a
pastor
wife
she
turned
again
to
her
books
what
she
had
was
very
good
and
she
had
found
an
old
woman
in
the
village
who
did
not
mind
being
comforted
so
that
added
to
everything
else
was
now
the
joy
of
gratitude
it
seemed
indeed
that
she
was
to
have
a
run
of
joys
that
spring
for
besides
these
came
suddenly
yet
another
the
joy
so
long
dreamed
of
of
having
some
one
to
talk
to
and
such
a
some
one
thought
ingeborg
entirely
dazzled
by
her
good
fortune
for
it
was
ingram
she
was
paddling
the
punt
as
usual
down
the
lake
one
afternoon
a
pile
of
books
at
her
feet
when
passing
the
end
of
the
arm
of
reeds
that
stretched
out
round
her
hidden
bay
she
perceived
that
her
little
beach
was
not
empty
and
pausing
astonished
with
her
paddle
arrested
in
the
air
to
look
she
recognized
in
the
middle
of
a
confusion
of
objects
strewn
round
him
that
no
doubt
had
to
do
with
painting
sitting
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
chin
in
his
hand
ingram
he
was
doing
nothing
just
staring
she
came
from
behind
the
arm
of
reeds
half
drifting
along
noiselessly
out
towards
the
middle
of
the
lake
straight
across
his
line
of
sight
for
an
instant
he
stared
motionless
while
she
holding
her
paddle
out
of
the
water
stared
equally
motionless
at
him
then
he
seized
his
sketching
book
and
began
furiously
to
draw
she
was
out
in
the
sun
and
had
no
hat
on
her
hair
was
the
strangest
colour
against
the
background
of
water
and
sky
more
like
a
larch
in
autumn
than
anything
he
could
think
of
she
seemed
the
vividest
thing
suddenly
cleaving
the
pallors
and
uncertainties
of
reeds
and
water
and
flecked
northern
sky
do
move
he
shouted
in
what
he
supposed
was
german
sketching
violently
so
it
you
she
called
back
in
english
and
her
voice
sang
yes
it
me
all
right
he
said
his
pencil
flying
he
did
not
recognise
her
he
had
seen
too
many
people
in
seven
years
to
keep
the
foggy
figure
of
that
distant
november
evening
in
his
mind
i
coming
in
she
called
digging
her
paddle
into
the
water
sit
still
he
shouted
but
i
want
to
talk
sit
she
sat
still
watching
him
unable
to
believe
her
good
fortune
if
he
were
only
here
again
for
a
single
day
and
she
could
only
talk
to
him
for
a
single
hour
what
a
refreshment
what
a
delight
to
talk
in
english
to
talk
to
some
one
who
had
painted
judith
to
talk
to
some
one
so
wonderful
to
talk
at
she
was
as
little
shy
as
a
person
stranded
on
a
desert
island
would
be
of
anybody
kings
included
who
should
appear
after
years
on
the
solitary
beach
well
she
called
after
sitting
patiently
for
what
she
felt
must
be
half
an
hour
but
which
was
five
minutes
he
did
not
answer
absorbed
in
what
he
was
doing
she
waited
for
what
seemed
another
and
then
turned
the
punt
in
the
direction
of
the
shore
i
coming
in
she
called
and
as
he
did
not
answer
she
paddled
towards
the
bay
he
stared
at
her
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
as
she
came
close
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
asked
seeing
she
was
manoeuvring
the
punt
into
the
corner
under
the
land
said
ingeborg
he
got
up
and
caught
hold
of
the
chain
fastened
to
the
punt
nose
and
dragged
it
up
the
beach
how
do
you
do
she
said
jumping
out
and
holding
out
her
hand
ingram
she
added
looking
up
at
him
her
face
quite
solemn
with
pleasure
well
now
but
who
on
earth
are
you
he
asked
shaking
her
hand
and
staring
her
clothes
now
that
she
was
standing
up
were
the
oddest
things
recalling
back
numbers
of
you
not
staying
at
the
glambecks
and
except
for
the
glambecks
there
is
anywhere
to
stay
but
i
told
you
i
was
the
pastor
wife
you
did
last
time
well
and
i
still
am
but
when
was
last
time
do
you
remember
you
were
staying
with
the
glambecks
then
too
but
i
have
stayed
with
the
glambecks
for
an
eternity
at
least
ten
years
seven
said
ingeborg
seven
and
a
half
it
was
in
november
but
you
must
have
been
in
pinafores
and
you
walked
down
the
avenue
with
me
do
you
remember
no
said
ingram
staring
at
her
and
you
scolded
me
because
i
could
walk
as
fast
as
you
did
you
remember
no
said
ingram
and
you
said
i
run
to
seed
if
i
was
careful
do
you
remember
no
said
ingram
and
i
had
on
my
grey
coat
and
skirt
do
you
remember
no
no
no
said
ingram
smiting
his
forehead
and
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
you
just
making
it
up
look
here
he
said
clearing
away
his
things
to
make
room
for
her
sit
down
and
let
us
talk
are
you
real
yes
and
i
live
at
kökensee
just
round
the
corner
behind
the
reeds
but
i
told
you
that
before
said
ingeborg
you
do
live
he
said
pushing
his
things
aside
you
not
just
a
little
dream
that
will
presently
disappear
again
my
name
dremmel
frau
dremmel
but
i
told
you
that
before
too
the
things
a
man
forgets
he
exclaimed
spreading
a
silk
handkerchief
over
the
coarse
grass
there
sit
on
that
you
laughing
at
me
she
said
sitting
down
and
i
do
mind
a
bit
i
much
too
glad
to
see
you
if
i
laugh
it
with
pleasure
he
said
staring
at
the
effect
of
her
against
the
pale
green
of
the
reeds
where
had
he
seen
just
that
before
that
scandinavian
colouring
that
burning
sort
of
brightness
in
the
hair
it
so
amusing
of
you
to
be
frau
anything
she
smiled
at
him
with
the
frankness
of
a
pleased
boy
you
very
you
know
he
said
smiling
back
you
did
think
so
last
time
you
called
me
your
dear
lady
and
asked
me
if
i
never
read
well
and
did
you
he
said
sitting
down
too
but
a
little
way
off
so
that
he
could
get
her
effect
better
yes
do
sit
down
then
i
sha
be
so
dreadfully
afraid
you
going
why
but
i
only
just
found
you
but
last
time
you
disappeared
almost
at
once
into
the
fog
and
only
just
found
me
then
she
said
her
hands
clasped
round
her
knees
her
face
the
face
of
the
entirely
happy
after
all
i
seem
to
have
made
some
progress
in
seven
years
he
said
i
apparently
could
see
then
no
it
was
me
i
was
very
invisible
invisible
oh
dilapidated
and
i
been
crying
you
look
here
nobody
with
your
kind
of
colouring
should
ever
cry
it
a
sin
it
would
be
most
distressing
seriously
if
you
were
ever
less
white
than
you
are
at
this
moment
see
how
nice
it
is
not
to
be
a
painter
said
ingeborg
i
do
mind
a
bit
if
you
white
or
not
so
long
as
it
you
but
why
should
you
like
it
to
be
me
asked
ingram
to
whom
flattery
used
as
he
was
to
it
was
very
pleasant
and
feeling
the
comfort
of
the
cat
who
is
being
gently
tickled
behind
the
ear
because
said
ingeborg
earnestly
you
somebody
wonderful
oh
but
you
make
me
purr
he
said
and
i
see
your
name
in
the
papers
at
least
once
a
week
she
said
oh
the
glory
and
berlin
got
two
of
your
pictures
bought
for
the
nation
yes
it
has
and
haggled
till
it
got
them
a
dead
bargain
and
you
painted
my
sister
what
he
said
quickly
staring
at
her
again
why
of
course
it
that
who
you
remind
me
of
the
amazing
judith
are
you
such
friends
she
asked
surprised
oh
well
then
the
wife
of
the
master
of
ananias
let
us
give
her
her
honours
she
the
most
entirely
beautiful
woman
i
seen
but
but
what
oh
well
i
did
a
very
good
portrait
of
her
the
old
boy
did
like
it
what
old
boy
the
master
he
tried
to
stop
my
showing
it
and
so
did
the
other
old
boy
what
other
old
boy
the
bishop
but
if
it
was
so
good
it
was
it
was
exact
it
was
the
living
woman
it
was
a
portrait
of
sheer
exquisite
flesh
well
then
said
ingeborg
oh
but
you
know
bishops
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
italy
got
it
now
it
at
venice
the
state
bought
it
you
must
go
and
see
it
next
time
you
there
i
will
she
laughed
the
very
next
time
and
her
laugh
was
the
laugh
of
joyful
amusement
itself
ingram
was
now
forty
three
or
four
and
leaner
than
ever
his
high
shoulders
were
narrow
his
thin
neck
came
a
long
way
out
of
his
collar
at
the
back
and
was
partly
hidden
in
front
by
his
short
red
beard
his
hair
darker
than
his
beard
was
plastered
down
neatly
he
had
very
light
piercing
eyes
and
a
nose
that
ingeborg
liked
she
liked
everything
she
liked
his
tweed
clothes
and
his
big
thin
hands
the
wonderful
hands
that
did
the
wonderful
pictures
and
his
long
thin
nimble
legs
she
liked
the
way
he
fidgeted
and
the
quickness
of
his
movements
and
she
glowed
with
pride
to
think
she
was
sitting
with
a
man
who
was
mentioned
in
the
papers
at
least
once
a
week
and
whose
pictures
were
bought
by
states
and
she
glowed
with
happiness
because
he
did
not
this
time
seem
anxious
to
go
back
to
the
glambecks
at
once
but
most
of
all
she
glowed
with
the
heavenliness
the
absolute
heavenliness
of
being
talked
to
and
you
her
sister
he
said
staring
at
her
now
that
really
is
astonishing
but
everybody
ca
be
beautiful
a
sister
of
hers
here
tucked
away
in
this
desert
it
a
desert
you
know
i
come
to
it
because
i
wanted
a
desert
one
does
sometimes
after
too
much
of
the
opposite
but
i
go
away
again
and
you
live
in
it
what
have
you
been
doing
all
these
years
since
i
was
here
last
oh
i
been
busy
but
not
here
not
all
the
time
here
yes
all
of
it
what
not
away
at
all
i
went
to
zoppot
once
zoppot
where
zoppot
i
never
heard
of
zoppot
i
do
believe
zoppot
any
good
do
you
mean
to
say
you
not
been
to
a
town
to
a
place
where
people
say
things
and
hear
things
and
rub
themselves
alive
against
each
other
since
last
i
was
here
well
but
pastors
wives
do
rub
but
it
incredible
it
like
death
why
did
you
because
i
could
as
though
it
were
possible
to
tear
oneself
free
at
least
every
now
and
then
you
wait
till
you
a
pastor
wife
but
how
do
you
manage
to
be
so
alive
for
you
shine
you
know
when
i
think
of
all
the
things
done
since
i
was
here
last
he
broke
off
and
looked
away
from
her
across
the
lake
oh
well
sickening
things
really
most
of
them
he
finished
wonderful
pictures
said
ingeborg
leaning
forward
and
flushing
with
her
enthusiasm
that
what
you
done
yes
one
paints
and
paints
but
in
between
it
those
in
between
the
that
hash
one
up
what
do
do
in
between
in
between
what
whatever
it
is
you
do
in
the
morning
and
whatever
it
is
you
do
in
the
evening
i
enjoy
myself
yes
yes
that
what
like
to
do
but
do
you
i
ca
what
ca
she
said
but
you
live
in
beauty
you
make
it
you
pour
it
over
the
world
she
stopped
abruptly
hit
by
a
sudden
thought
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
i
do
know
anything
really
perhaps
you
in
mourning
he
looked
at
her
no
he
said
i
not
in
mourning
or
perhaps
no
you
not
and
you
ca
be
poor
well
then
why
in
the
world
do
you
enjoy
yourself
are
you
ever
bored
he
answered
the
days
are
long
enough
he
looked
round
at
the
empty
landscape
and
shuddered
here
in
kökensee
he
said
it
spring
now
but
what
about
the
wet
days
the
howling
days
what
about
unmanageable
months
like
february
why
he
turned
to
her
you
must
be
a
perfect
little
seething
vessel
of
independent
happiness
bubbling
over
with
just
your
own
contentments
i
never
was
called
a
seething
vessel
before
said
ingeborg
hugging
her
knees
her
eyes
dancing
what
an
impression
for
a
respectable
woman
to
produce
what
a
gift
to
possess
you
mean
the
greatest
of
all
to
carry
happiness
about
with
one
but
that
exactly
what
do
are
you
spilling
joy
at
every
step
splashing
it
into
all
the
galleries
of
the
world
leaving
beauty
behind
you
wherever
you
been
he
twisted
himself
round
to
lie
at
full
length
and
look
up
at
her
what
delightful
things
you
say
he
said
i
wish
i
could
think
you
mean
them
mean
them
she
exclaimed
flushing
again
do
you
suppose
i
waste
the
precious
minutes
saying
things
i
do
mean
i
have
talked
to
any
one
really
for
years
not
to
any
one
who
answered
back
and
now
why
it
too
wonderful
as
though
i
waste
a
second
of
it
you
the
queerest
most
surprising
thing
to
find
here
on
the
edge
of
the
world
he
said
gazing
up
at
her
and
there
the
sun
just
got
at
your
hair
through
the
trees
are
you
always
full
of
molten
enthusiasms
for
people
only
for
you
but
what
am
i
to
say
to
these
repeated
pattings
he
cried
you
got
into
my
imagination
that
day
i
met
you
and
you
been
in
it
ever
since
i
was
in
the
stupidest
state
of
dull
giving
in
you
pulled
me
out
he
stared
at
her
his
chin
on
his
hand
imagine
me
pulling
anybody
out
of
anything
he
said
generally
i
pull
them
in
it
true
i
had
relapses
she
said
five
relapses
five
she
nodded
five
since
then
but
here
i
am
seething
as
you
call
it
and
it
you
who
started
me
and
i
believe
i
shall
go
on
now
doing
it
uninterruptedly
for
ever
ingram
put
out
his
hand
with
a
quick
movement
as
though
he
were
going
to
touch
the
edge
of
her
dress
teach
me
how
to
seethe
he
said
that
rather
like
asking
a
worm
to
give
lessons
in
twinkling
to
a
star
wonderful
he
said
softly
after
a
little
pause
to
lie
here
having
sweet
things
said
to
one
why
did
i
find
you
before
i
been
being
bored
at
the
glambecks
for
a
whole
frightful
week
oh
have
you
been
there
a
week
already
she
asked
anxiously
then
you
go
away
soon
i
was
going
that
like
last
time
you
were
just
going
when
i
met
you
but
now
i
going
to
stay
i
going
to
stay
and
paint
you
she
jumped
she
exclaimed
paint
you
and
paint
you
and
paint
you
said
ingram
and
see
if
i
can
catch
some
of
your
happiness
for
myself
get
at
your
secret
find
out
where
it
all
comes
from
but
it
comes
from
you
at
this
moment
it
all
you
it
does
it
inside
you
and
i
want
to
get
as
much
of
it
as
i
can
i
dusty
and
hot
and
sick
of
everything
i
come
and
stay
near
you
and
paint
you
and
you
shall
make
me
clean
and
cool
again
the
stuff
you
talk
she
said
leaning
forward
her
face
full
of
laughter
as
though
i
could
do
anything
for
you
really
making
fun
of
me
the
whole
time
but
i
do
care
i
do
care
about
anything
so
long
as
you
wo
go
away
you
need
be
afraid
i
going
away
i
going
to
have
a
bath
of
remoteness
and
peace
i
chuck
the
glambecks
and
get
a
room
in
your
village
i
come
every
day
and
paint
you
you
like
a
little
golden
leaf
a
beech
leaf
in
autumn
blown
suddenly
from
god
knows
where
across
my
path
now
it
you
making
purr
she
said
you
like
everything
that
clear
and
bright
and
cool
and
fresh
oh
murmured
ingeborg
radiant
and
i
have
even
got
a
tail
to
wag
already
after
only
ten
minutes
of
you
i
feel
as
if
i
were
eating
cold
fresh
very
crisp
lettuce
that
not
nearly
so
nice
i
do
think
i
like
being
lettuce
i
do
care
you
are
and
i
going
to
paint
you
i
going
to
paint
your
soul
tell
me
some
addresses
for
lodgings
he
said
snatching
up
a
sheet
of
paper
and
a
pencil
there
are
any
then
i
must
stay
at
your
vicarage
you
have
to
sleep
with
robert
then
what
who
is
robert
my
husband
oh
yes
but
how
absurd
that
sounds
what
does
your
having
a
husband
i
do
see
how
you
can
help
having
a
husband
if
you
a
wife
no
it
inevitable
but
it
quaint
that
you
should
be
wife
let
alone
a
pastor
here
in
kökensee
she
got
up
impulsively
come
and
see
him
she
said
you
would
last
time
come
now
let
me
make
tea
for
you
let
me
have
the
pride
of
making
tea
for
you
but
not
this
minute
he
begged
as
she
stood
over
him
holding
out
her
hand
to
pull
him
up
yes
yes
he
in
now
he
be
out
in
his
fields
later
he
be
frightfully
pleased
we
tell
him
about
the
picture
oh
but
you
did
it
did
you
she
added
suddenly
anxious
he
got
up
reluctantly
and
grumbling
i
do
want
to
see
robert
why
should
i
see
robert
i
do
believe
i
going
to
like
robert
he
muttered
looking
down
at
her
from
what
seemed
an
immense
height
of
course
i
mean
it
about
the
picture
he
added
in
a
different
voice
quick
and
interested
it
be
a
companion
portrait
to
your
sister
he
laughed
that
would
really
be
very
amusing
he
said
stooping
down
and
neatly
putting
his
scattered
things
together
ingeborg
flushed
but
that
rather
cruel
fun
is
it
that
making
of
me
now
she
murmured
what
he
asked
straightening
himself
to
look
at
her
the
light
had
gone
out
of
her
face
what
why
did
i
tell
you
my
picture
of
you
is
to
be
the
portrait
of
a
spirit
he
pounced
on
his
things
and
gathered
them
up
in
his
arms
come
along
he
said
impatiently
and
be
intelligent
let
me
beg
you
to
be
intelligent
come
along
i
suppose
i
to
go
in
the
punt
in
it
books
by
the
dozen
what
this
eucken
keats
pragmatism
o
lord
why
o
lord
she
asked
getting
in
and
picking
up
the
paddle
while
he
gave
the
punt
a
vigorous
shove
off
and
jumped
on
to
it
as
it
went
she
was
radiant
again
she
was
tingling
with
pride
and
joy
he
really
meant
it
about
the
picture
he
had
made
fun
of
her
on
the
contrary
why
o
lord
she
asked
you
said
that
or
something
like
it
last
time
because
i
read
well
now
i
say
it
because
you
do
he
said
crouching
at
the
opposite
end
watching
her
movements
as
she
paddled
but
that
does
seem
to
have
much
consistency
does
it
she
said
hang
consistency
i
do
want
you
addled
and
you
get
addled
if
you
topple
all
these
different
stuffs
into
your
little
head
together
but
i
rather
be
addled
than
empty
nonsense
if
i
could
i
stop
your
doing
anything
that
may
alter
you
a
hairbreadth
from
what
you
are
at
this
moment
to
that
she
remarked
suspending
her
paddle
in
mid
air
her
face
as
sparkling
as
the
shining
drops
that
flashed
from
it
that
she
really
was
greatly
enjoying
herself
and
they
both
laughed
ingram
waited
in
the
parlour
where
he
stood
taking
in
with
attentive
eyes
the
details
of
that
neglected
almost
snubbed
little
room
while
ingeborg
went
to
the
laboratory
so
happy
and
proud
that
she
forgot
she
was
breaking
rules
to
fetch
as
she
said
robert
robert
however
would
not
be
fetched
he
looked
up
at
her
with
a
great
reproach
on
her
entrance
for
as
invariably
happened
on
the
rare
occasions
when
the
tremendousness
of
what
she
had
to
say
seemed
to
her
to
justify
interrupting
he
thought
he
had
just
arrived
within
reach
after
an
infinite
patient
stalking
of
the
coy
illusive
heart
of
the
problem
ingram
here
she
said
breathlessly
he
gazed
at
her
over
his
spectacles
in
the
parlour
said
ingeborg
he
come
to
tea
is
it
wonderful
he
going
to
paint
who
is
here
ingeborg
ingram
edward
ingram
come
and
talk
to
him
while
i
get
tea
she
had
even
forgotten
to
shut
the
door
in
her
excitement
and
a
puff
of
wind
from
the
open
window
picked
up
herr
dremmel
papers
and
blew
them
into
confusion
he
endeavoured
to
catch
them
and
requested
her
in
a
tone
of
controlled
irritation
to
shut
the
door
oh
how
dreadful
of
me
she
said
hastily
doing
it
but
with
gaiety
i
do
not
know
then
said
herr
dremmel
mastering
his
annoyance
mr
ingram
rut
robert
it
ingram
edward
ingram
the
greatest
artist
there
is
now
the
great
portrait
painter
berlin
has
is
he
a
connection
of
your
family
ingeborg
no
but
he
painted
ju
then
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
interrupt
my
afternoon
on
his
behalf
and
herr
dremmel
bent
his
head
over
his
papers
again
but
robert
he
he
great
herr
dremmel
with
a
wetted
thumb
diligently
rearranged
his
pages
but
why
i
told
him
you
love
to
see
him
what
am
i
to
say
to
him
if
you
do
come
herr
dremmel
his
eye
caught
by
a
sentence
he
had
written
was
reading
with
a
deep
enormous
appetite
tea
said
ingeborg
desperately
there
tea
you
always
come
to
tea
it
be
ready
in
a
minute
he
looked
up
at
her
gathering
her
into
his
consciousness
again
tea
he
said
but
even
as
he
said
it
his
thoughts
fell
off
to
his
problem
and
without
removing
his
eyes
from
hers
he
began
carefully
to
consider
a
new
aspect
of
it
that
in
that
instant
had
occurred
to
him
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
away
so
she
went
chapter
xxviii
ingram
visit
to
the
glambecks
had
in
any
case
been
coming
to
an
end
the
next
day
when
he
was
to
have
gone
to
königsberg
on
his
way
to
the
caucasus
a
place
he
hoped
might
trick
him
by
its
novelty
for
at
least
a
time
out
of
boredom
and
the
baron
and
baroness
were
greatly
surprised
when
he
told
them
he
was
not
going
to
the
caucasus
but
to
kökensee
instead
with
one
voice
they
exclaimed
kökensee
to
paint
the
pastor
wife
hair
said
ingram
the
baron
and
baroness
were
silent
the
explanation
seemed
to
them
beyond
comment
its
disreputableness
robbed
them
of
speech
herr
ingram
of
course
an
artist
of
renown
if
he
had
not
been
of
very
great
renown
they
could
not
have
seen
their
way
to
admitting
him
on
terms
of
equality
into
their
circle
might
paint
whoever
hair
he
pleased
but
was
there
not
some
ecclesiastical
law
forbidding
that
the
hair
of
one
wife
should
be
painted
to
have
one
hair
painted
when
one
was
a
pastor
wife
was
hardly
more
respectable
than
having
it
dyed
people
of
family
were
painted
in
order
to
hand
down
their
portrait
to
succeeding
generations
but
you
had
to
have
generations
you
had
to
have
scions
you
had
to
have
a
noble
stock
for
the
scions
to
spring
from
and
the
painting
was
entered
into
soberly
discreetly
advisedly
in
the
fear
of
god
for
the
delectation
of
children
not
lightly
or
wantonly
not
for
effect
not
as
herr
ingram
had
added
of
frau
pastor
hair
because
any
portion
of
one
person
was
strangely
beautiful
strangely
beautiful
they
looked
at
each
other
and
the
baroness
raised
her
large
and
undulating
white
hands
from
her
black
lap
for
a
moment
and
let
them
drop
on
to
it
again
and
the
baron
slowly
nodded
his
entire
agreement
ingram
had
found
a
room
in
the
village
inn
at
kökensee
a
place
so
sordid
so
entirely
impossible
as
the
next
habitation
after
theirs
for
one
who
had
been
their
guest
that
the
baron
and
baroness
were
concerned
for
what
their
servants
must
think
when
they
heard
him
direct
their
coachman
in
the
presence
of
their
butler
and
footman
as
he
clambered
nimbly
into
the
dogcart
to
take
him
to
it
and
the
baroness
went
in
and
wrote
at
once
to
her
son
hildebrand
in
berlin
who
had
introduced
ingram
to
glambeck
and
told
him
she
did
not
intend
permitting
herr
ingram
to
visit
her
again
please
she
wrote
did
it
but
how
true
it
is
that
these
artists
can
never
rise
beyond
being
artists
i
have
finished
with
outsiders
however
clever
give
me
she
did
not
mention
she
found
she
could
not
mention
the
hair
and
to
the
baron
that
evening
she
expressed
the
hope
that
at
least
the
picture
would
only
be
in
watercolour
watercolour
she
felt
seemed
somehow
nearer
the
commandments
than
oils
it
was
impossible
to
paint
a
serious
picture
of
ingeborg
in
the
dark
little
parlour
at
the
parsonage
and
as
there
was
no
other
room
at
all
that
they
could
use
ingram
began
a
series
of
sketches
of
her
out
of
doors
in
the
garden
in
the
punt
anywhere
and
everywhere
i
must
get
some
idea
of
you
he
said
perceiving
that
a
reason
for
his
coming
every
day
had
to
be
provided
later
on
i
do
the
real
picture
in
a
proper
studio
i
wonder
how
i
get
to
a
proper
studio
smiled
ingeborg
i
got
a
very
good
one
in
venice
you
must
sit
to
me
there
as
though
it
were
round
the
corner
but
these
are
very
wonderful
she
said
taking
up
the
sketches
i
wish
i
were
really
like
that
it
exactly
you
as
you
were
at
the
moment
nonsense
she
said
but
she
glowed
she
knew
it
was
not
true
but
she
loved
to
believe
he
somehow
by
some
miracle
saw
her
so
the
sketches
were
exquisite
little
impressions
of
happy
moments
caught
into
immortality
by
a
master
hardly
ever
did
he
do
more
than
her
head
and
throat
and
sometimes
the
delicate
descent
to
her
shoulder
the
day
she
saw
his
idea
of
the
back
of
her
neck
she
flushed
with
pleasure
it
was
such
a
beautiful
thing
that
not
me
she
murmured
is
it
i
do
believe
anybody
has
ever
explained
to
you
what
like
there
was
any
need
to
i
can
see
for
myself
apparently
that
just
what
you
ca
do
it
was
high
time
i
came
oh
but
was
it
she
agreed
earnestly
he
thought
her
frankness
her
unadorned
way
of
saying
what
she
felt
as
refreshing
and
as
surprising
as
being
splashed
with
clear
cold
shining
mountain
water
he
had
never
met
anything
feminine
that
was
quite
so
near
absolute
simplicity
he
might
call
her
the
most
extravagantly
flattering
things
and
she
appreciated
them
and
savoured
them
with
a
kind
of
objective
delight
that
interested
him
at
first
extraordinarily
then
it
began
to
annoy
him
illustration
but
these
are
very
wonderful
she
said
taking
up
the
sketches
i
wish
i
were
really
like
that
you
as
unselfconscious
he
told
her
one
afternoon
a
little
crossly
when
he
had
been
ransacking
heaven
and
earth
and
most
of
the
poets
for
images
to
compare
her
with
and
she
had
sat
immensely
pleased
and
interested
and
urging
him
at
intervals
to
go
on
as
a
but
what
a
nice
clean
soaped
sort
of
thing
to
be
like
she
said
and
so
much
more
alive
than
lettuces
i
wonder
if
you
alive
he
said
staring
at
her
and
she
looked
at
him
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
told
him
that
if
she
were
not
a
bishop
daughter
and
a
pastor
wife
and
a
child
of
many
prayers
and
trained
from
infancy
to
keep
carefully
within
the
limits
of
the
allowable
in
female
speech
she
would
reply
to
that
you
bet
but
that
only
if
i
were
vulgar
that
i
say
that
she
explained
gentility
is
the
sole
barrier
i
expect
really
between
me
and
excess
you
and
excess
you
little
funny
thing
one
would
as
soon
connect
the
dawn
and
the
fields
before
sunrise
and
small
birds
and
the
greenest
of
green
young
leaves
with
excess
he
was
more
near
being
quite
happy
during
this
first
week
than
he
could
remember
to
have
been
since
that
period
of
pinafore
in
which
the
world
is
all
mother
and
daisies
he
was
enjoying
the
interest
of
complete
contrast
the
freshness
that
lies
about
beginnings
from
this
remoteness
this
queer
intimate
german
setting
he
looked
at
his
usual
life
as
at
something
entirely
foolish
hurried
noisy
and
tiresome
all
those
women
good
heavens
all
those
women
who
collected
and
coagulated
about
his
path
what
terrible
things
they
seemed
from
here
women
he
had
painted
who
rose
up
and
reproached
him
because
his
idea
of
them
and
their
idea
were
different
women
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
or
tried
to
persuade
himself
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
or
tried
to
hope
he
would
presently
be
able
to
persuade
himself
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
women
who
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
and
fluffed
and
flapped
about
him
monsters
of
soft
enveloping
suffocation
women
he
had
wronged
absurd
word
women
who
had
claims
on
him
claims
on
him
on
him
who
belonged
only
to
art
and
the
universe
and
there
was
his
wife
good
heavens
yes
his
wife
from
these
distresses
and
irksomenesses
from
a
shouting
world
from
the
crowds
and
popularity
that
pushed
between
him
and
the
one
thing
that
mattered
his
work
from
the
horrors
of
home
life
the
horrors
of
society
and
vain
repetitions
of
genialities
from
all
the
people
who
talked
about
thought
and
art
and
the
mind
of
the
world
from
jealousies
affections
praises
passions
excitement
boredom
he
felt
very
safe
at
kökensee
to
be
over
there
in
the
middle
of
the
distracting
emptiness
of
london
was
like
having
the
sour
dust
of
a
neglected
blown
into
one
face
to
be
over
here
in
kökensee
was
to
feel
like
a
single
goldfish
in
a
bowl
of
clear
water
ingeborg
was
the
clear
water
kökensee
was
the
bowl
for
a
week
he
swam
with
delight
in
this
new
element
for
a
week
he
felt
so
good
and
innocent
exercising
himself
in
its
cool
translucency
that
almost
did
he
seem
a
goldfish
in
a
bib
then
ingeborg
began
to
annoy
him
and
she
annoyed
him
for
the
precise
reason
that
had
till
then
charmed
him
her
curious
resemblance
to
a
boy
this
frank
affection
this
unconcealed
delight
in
his
society
this
excessive
admiration
were
arresting
at
first
and
amusing
and
delicious
after
the
sham
freshness
the
tricks
the
sham
daring
things
of
the
women
he
had
known
they
were
like
a
bath
at
the
end
of
a
hot
night
like
a
country
platform
at
the
end
of
a
stuffy
railway
journey
but
you
can
not
sit
in
a
bath
all
day
or
stay
permanently
on
a
platform
you
do
want
to
go
on
you
do
want
things
to
develop
ingram
was
nettled
by
ingeborg
apparent
inability
to
develop
it
was
all
very
well
it
was
charming
to
be
like
a
boy
for
a
little
while
but
to
persist
in
it
was
tiresome
nothing
he
could
say
nothing
he
could
apply
to
her
in
the
way
of
warm
and
varied
epithet
brought
the
faintest
trace
of
into
her
eyes
what
can
be
done
he
thought
with
a
woman
who
will
not
be
self
conscious
she
received
his
speeches
with
enthusiasm
she
hailed
them
with
delight
and
laughter
and
what
was
particularly
disconcerting
she
answered
back
answered
back
with
equal
warmth
and
with
equal
variety
sometimes
he
suspected
annoyed
at
being
outdone
in
epithet
with
even
more
to
judge
from
her
talk
she
almost
made
love
to
him
he
would
have
supposed
it
was
quite
making
love
if
he
had
not
known
if
he
had
not
been
so
acutely
aware
that
it
was
not
with
a
face
of
radiance
and
a
voice
of
joy
she
would
say
suddenly
that
god
had
been
very
good
to
her
and
when
he
asked
in
what
way
would
answer
earnestly
in
sending
you
here
and
then
she
would
add
in
that
peculiar
sweet
voice
she
certainly
had
thought
ingram
a
peculiar
sweet
voice
a
little
husky
again
a
little
like
a
but
a
with
a
slight
sore
throat
i
missed
you
dreadfully
all
these
years
i
been
lonely
for
you
and
the
honesty
of
her
the
honest
sincerity
of
her
eyes
when
she
said
these
things
no
older
than
ten
could
look
at
one
with
quite
such
a
straight
simplicity
every
day
punctually
at
two
by
which
time
the
daily
convulsion
of
dinner
and
its
washing
up
was
over
at
the
parsonage
he
walked
across
from
his
inn
while
kökensee
mouths
behind
curtains
and
round
doors
guttered
with
excited
commentary
telling
himself
as
he
gazed
down
the
peaceful
street
that
this
was
the
emptiest
place
in
the
world
to
the
dremmel
gate
and
dodging
the
various
rich
puddles
of
the
yard
passed
round
the
corner
of
the
house
along
the
lilac
path
beneath
the
laboratory
windows
to
where
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
ingeborg
sat
waiting
then
he
would
sketch
her
or
pretend
to
sketch
her
according
as
the
mood
was
on
him
and
they
would
talk
by
the
second
day
he
knew
all
about
her
life
since
her
marriage
her
six
children
they
amazed
and
appalled
him
her
pursuit
started
by
him
of
culture
her
housekeeping
her
pride
in
robert
cleverness
her
solitude
her
thirst
for
some
one
to
talk
to
persons
like
ilse
and
rosa
frau
dremmel
robertlet
and
ditti
became
extraordinarily
real
to
him
he
made
little
drawings
of
them
while
she
talked
up
the
edge
of
his
paper
and
he
also
knew
by
the
second
day
all
about
her
life
in
redchester
its
filial
ardours
its
duties
its
difficulties
when
it
came
to
disentangling
itself
from
the
bishop
and
his
paper
sprawled
up
its
other
edge
with
tiny
bishops
and
unattached
expressive
aprons
the
one
thing
she
concealed
from
him
of
the
larger
happenings
of
her
life
was
lucerne
but
even
that
he
knew
after
a
week
so
you
can
do
things
he
said
looking
at
her
with
a
new
interest
you
can
do
real
live
things
oh
yes
if
i
properly
goaded
i
wonder
what
you
mean
by
properly
goaded
well
i
was
goaded
then
goaded
by
being
kept
in
one
place
uninterruptedly
for
years
that
what
is
happening
to
you
now
oh
but
this
is
different
and
i
been
to
zoppot
zoppot
besides
here
but
i
wo
be
here
for
ever
oh
but
you
be
somewhere
in
the
same
world
as
though
that
were
any
good
of
course
it
is
i
shall
read
about
you
in
the
papers
nonsense
he
said
crossly
the
papers
and
i
shall
curl
up
in
your
memory
as
if
i
were
dead
you
sometimes
really
are
beyond
words
ridiculous
i
expect
it
because
i
had
so
little
education
she
said
meekly
at
almost
every
day
herr
dremmel
joined
them
in
the
garden
and
the
conversation
became
stately
the
sketches
were
produced
and
he
made
polite
comments
he
discussed
art
with
ingram
and
ingram
discussed
fertilizers
with
him
and
as
neither
knew
anything
about
the
specialty
they
discussed
by
force
of
intelligence
ingeborg
poured
out
the
tea
and
listened
full
of
pride
in
them
both
she
thought
how
much
they
must
be
liking
and
admiring
each
other
robert
sound
sense
his
quaint
and
often
majestic
english
his
obviously
notable
scientific
attainments
must
she
felt
sure
deeply
impress
ingram
and
of
course
to
see
and
speak
to
the
great
ingram
every
day
could
not
but
give
immense
gratification
to
robert
now
that
he
had
become
aware
of
who
he
was
she
sat
between
the
two
men
in
her
voluminous
white
frock
looking
from
one
to
the
other
with
eager
pride
while
they
talked
she
did
not
say
anything
herself
out
of
respect
for
such
a
combination
of
brains
but
she
was
all
ears
she
drank
the
words
in
it
was
more
she
felt
even
than
the
ingram
hated
at
the
parsonage
every
day
it
was
more
of
an
effort
to
meet
herr
dremmel
ceremoniousness
appropriately
and
his
scientific
thirst
for
facts
about
art
bored
ingram
intolerably
he
detested
the
large
soft
creases
of
his
clothes
and
the
way
they
buttoned
and
bulged
between
the
buttonings
he
disliked
him
for
having
sleeves
and
trousers
that
were
too
long
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
the
six
children
he
did
not
want
to
hear
about
and
resented
having
regularly
every
afternoon
to
pretend
he
did
and
he
did
want
and
this
became
a
growing
wish
and
a
growing
awkwardness
to
make
love
to
herr
dremmel
wife
herr
dremmel
large
unconsciousness
of
such
a
possibility
annoyed
him
particularly
his
obliviousness
to
the
attractiveness
of
ingeborg
he
would
certainly
deserve
thought
ingram
anything
he
got
it
was
scandalous
not
to
take
more
care
of
a
little
thing
like
that
every
day
at
he
was
enraged
by
this
want
of
care
in
herr
dremmel
and
every
day
before
and
after
tea
he
was
engrossed
if
abortive
efforts
to
philander
can
be
called
so
in
not
taking
care
of
her
himself
you
see
said
ingeborg
when
he
commented
on
the
immense
personal
absences
and
withdrawals
of
herr
dremmel
robert
is
very
wonderful
the
things
he
does
with
just
grains
and
of
course
if
one
is
going
to
achieve
anything
one
has
to
give
up
every
minute
to
it
why
even
when
he
loved
me
he
used
to
even
when
he
loved
you
interrupted
ingram
what
does
he
now
oh
yes
yes
she
said
quickly
flushing
i
meant
of
course
he
does
and
besides
one
always
loves
one
wife
no
one
does
yes
one
does
they
left
it
at
that
at
the
end
of
his
second
week
in
kökensee
ingram
found
himself
increasing
the
number
of
his
adjectives
and
images
and
comparisons
growing
almost
eagerly
poetical
for
the
force
of
proximity
and
want
of
any
one
else
to
talk
to
or
to
think
about
was
beginning
to
work
and
it
was
becoming
the
one
thing
that
seemed
to
him
to
matter
to
get
into
her
frank
eyes
something
besides
or
instead
of
that
glow
of
admiring
friendliness
he
was
now
very
much
attracted
and
almost
equally
exasperated
she
was
after
all
a
woman
and
it
was
absurd
it
was
incredible
that
he
ingram
with
all
these
opportunities
should
not
be
able
to
shake
her
out
of
her
first
position
of
just
wonder
at
him
as
an
artist
and
a
celebrity
she
was
so
warm
and
friendly
and
close
in
one
sense
and
so
nowhere
at
all
in
another
so
responsive
so
quick
so
ready
to
pile
the
sweetest
honey
of
flattery
and
admiration
on
him
and
so
blank
to
the
fact
that
well
that
there
they
were
he
and
she
and
then
she
had
a
sense
of
fun
that
interrupted
a
sense
most
admirable
in
a
woman
at
any
other
time
but
not
when
she
is
being
made
love
to
also
she
was
very
irrelevant
he
could
not
fix
her
she
tumbled
about
mentally
and
that
hindered
progress
too
not
that
he
cared
a
straw
for
her
mentality
except
in
so
far
as
its
quality
was
a
hindrance
it
was
that
other
part
of
her
her
queer
little
soul
that
interested
him
her
happiness
and
zest
of
life
and
of
course
the
graces
and
harmonies
of
her
lines
and
colouring
you
know
i
suppose
he
said
to
her
one
evening
as
they
walked
slowly
back
along
the
path
through
the
and
the
cool
scents
of
the
ended
summer
day
rose
in
their
faces
as
they
walked
that
i
give
a
hundred
days
of
life
in
london
or
paris
for
an
hour
of
this
atmosphere
this
cleanness
that
there
is
about
you
i
do
think
a
hundred
much
i
give
them
to
be
with
you
here
now
in
the
is
it
wonderful
this
evening
is
it
beautiful
did
you
smell
that
she
stopped
and
raised
her
nose
selectingly
just
that
instant
that
convolvulus
you
have
such
faith
in
my
gods
he
went
on
when
he
could
get
her
away
from
the
convolvulus
such
a
bravery
of
belief
such
a
dear
bravery
of
belief
well
but
of
course
she
said
turning
shining
eyes
on
to
him
who
would
believe
in
your
gods
art
love
of
beauty
but
it
is
only
art
my
gods
are
all
sweet
things
and
all
fine
things
said
ingram
convinced
at
the
moment
that
he
had
never
done
anything
but
worship
gods
of
that
particular
flavour
so
thoroughly
was
he
being
purged
by
the
hyssop
of
life
in
kökensee
oh
said
ingeborg
with
an
awed
enthusiasm
how
wonderful
it
is
that
you
should
be
exactly
what
you
are
but
it
of
you
she
added
with
a
little
movement
of
her
hands
smiling
up
at
him
to
be
so
what
you
are
and
do
you
know
what
exactly
you
are
you
the
open
window
in
the
of
my
life
she
held
her
breath
a
moment
how
very
beautiful
she
then
said
how
beautiful
and
how
kind
you
are
to
think
of
me
like
that
but
why
is
it
a
you
of
all
people
it
is
living
you
see
it
existence
in
caricature
over
there
like
dining
perpetually
with
madame
tussaud
waxworks
or
anything
else
totally
unreal
and
incredible
but
i
do
understand
how
a
great
artist
and
you
like
an
open
window
like
the
sky
like
sweet
air
like
freedom
like
secret
light
oh
she
murmured
deprecating
but
enchanted
when
i
with
you
i
feel
an
intolerable
disgust
for
all
the
chatter
and
flatulence
of
that
other
life
and
when
i
with
you
she
said
i
feel
as
if
i
were
stuffed
with
oh
with
stars
he
was
silent
a
moment
then
determined
not
to
be
outdone
he
said
when
i
with
you
i
begin
to
feel
like
a
star
myself
as
though
you
were
always
one
no
it
only
you
till
i
found
you
i
was
just
an
angry
ball
of
mud
but
a
thirsty
man
in
a
stuffy
room
but
an
emptiness
a
wailing
blank
an
eviscerated
thing
a
what
asked
ingeborg
who
had
not
heard
that
word
before
and
you
he
went
on
are
the
cool
water
that
quenches
me
the
scent
of
roses
come
into
the
room
liquid
light
to
my
clay
she
drew
a
deep
breath
it
wonderful
wonderful
she
said
and
it
sounds
so
real
somehow
really
almost
as
though
you
meant
it
oh
i
do
mind
you
making
fun
of
me
a
bit
if
only
you
go
on
saying
lovely
things
like
that
fun
of
you
have
you
no
idea
then
positively
no
idea
how
sweet
you
are
he
bent
down
and
looked
into
her
face
with
little
kisses
in
each
of
your
eyes
he
said
scrutinizing
them
chapter
xxix
in
redchester
nobody
talked
of
kisses
they
were
things
not
mentioned
they
were
things
allowable
only
under
strictly
defined
conditions
if
you
did
not
want
to
kiss
for
instance
and
the
other
person
did
not
like
it
and
confined
in
their
application
to
the
related
like
pews
in
a
parish
church
they
were
reserved
for
families
aunts
might
kiss
freely
especially
if
they
were
bearded
ingeborg
had
an
aunt
with
a
beard
mothers
might
kiss
she
had
seen
her
calm
mother
kiss
a
baby
with
a
sort
of
devouring
a
cannibalism
bishops
might
kiss
within
a
certain
restricted
area
as
for
husbands
they
did
kiss
and
nothing
stopped
them
till
the
day
when
they
suddenly
did
but
no
one
aunts
mothers
bishops
or
husbands
regarded
the
practice
as
a
suitable
basis
for
conversation
how
refreshing
therefore
and
how
altogether
delightful
it
was
that
ingram
should
be
so
natural
and
how
she
loved
to
know
that
though
of
course
he
was
pretending
about
the
little
kisses
in
her
eyes
he
thought
it
worth
while
to
pretend
with
glee
and
pride
and
amusement
she
wondered
what
redchester
would
say
if
it
could
hear
the
great
man
it
too
honoured
being
so
simple
and
at
the
same
time
so
very
kind
for
the
first
time
she
did
not
answer
back
she
was
silent
thinking
amused
and
pleasant
thoughts
and
ingram
walking
beside
her
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
a
gayness
about
his
heels
felt
triumphant
for
he
had
he
thought
got
through
to
her
he
had
got
her
quiet
at
last
not
that
he
did
not
enjoy
the
incense
she
burned
before
him
the
unabashed
expression
of
her
admiration
but
a
man
wants
room
for
his
lovemaking
and
once
he
is
embarked
on
that
pleasant
exercise
he
does
not
want
the
words
taken
out
of
his
mouth
ingeborg
was
always
taking
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
and
then
flinging
them
back
at
him
again
with
as
it
were
a
flower
stuck
behind
their
ear
he
had
known
that
if
once
he
could
pierce
through
to
her
she
would
leave
off
doing
this
she
would
become
aware
that
he
was
a
man
and
she
was
a
woman
she
would
become
passive
she
would
let
go
of
persisting
that
he
was
a
and
she
a
sort
of
humble
or
its
equivalent
in
his
temple
now
apparently
he
had
pierced
through
and
her
silence
as
she
walked
beside
him
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
was
more
sweet
to
him
than
anything
she
had
ever
said
before
however
they
had
reached
the
gap
in
the
lilac
hedge
that
formed
the
simple
entrance
on
that
side
to
the
dremmel
garden
there
she
was
beginning
again
in
she
began
oh
he
interrupted
are
you
going
to
give
me
a
description
of
the
town
and
its
environs
so
as
to
keep
me
from
giving
you
a
description
of
yourself
no
she
laughed
you
know
i
could
listen
to
you
for
ever
the
same
frankness
the
same
shining
look
ingram
wanted
to
kick
i
was
thinking
she
went
on
how
nobody
in
redchester
ever
talked
about
kisses
even
little
ones
so
you
are
shocked
no
what
a
word
i
full
of
wonder
at
the
miracle
of
you
being
so
kind
to
me
saying
such
beautiful
things
thinking
such
beautiful
things
this
trick
of
gratitude
was
really
maddening
tell
me
about
redchester
he
said
shortly
do
they
kiss
each
other
there
oh
yes
but
they
do
have
them
in
their
eyes
he
shuddered
and
people
do
mention
them
unless
it
aunts
and
then
not
like
that
no
aunt
could
ever
possibly
be
of
the
pregnant
parts
needful
for
the
invention
of
a
phrase
like
that
and
if
she
were
i
do
suppose
want
to
listen
you
do
at
least
then
want
to
listen
want
to
are
i
listening
always
to
every
word
you
say
with
both
my
ears
what
a
mercy
she
added
with
thankfulness
what
a
real
mercy
what
an
escape
that
you
an
aunt
you
ca
call
it
exactly
a
hairbreadth
escape
he
said
moodily
i
do
feel
even
the
rough
beginnings
of
an
aunt
anywhere
about
me
he
walked
with
her
through
the
darkness
of
the
avenue
refusing
to
stay
to
supper
why
could
he
not
then
and
there
in
that
solitary
dark
place
catch
her
in
his
arms
and
force
her
to
wake
up
to
leave
off
being
a
a
or
shake
her
one
or
the
other
at
that
moment
he
did
not
much
care
which
but
he
could
not
he
told
himself
that
why
he
could
not
was
because
she
would
be
so
limitlessly
surprised
and
that
for
all
her
surprise
he
would
be
no
nearer
not
an
inch
nearer
to
whatever
it
was
in
her
he
was
now
so
eager
to
reach
she
might
even
indeed
he
felt
certain
she
would
thank
him
profusely
for
such
a
further
mark
of
esteem
for
being
as
she
would
say
so
very
kind
are
you
tired
she
asked
peering
up
at
his
face
in
the
scented
gloom
for
it
was
the
time
of
the
flowering
of
the
on
his
suddenly
stopping
and
saying
good
night
no
you
feeling
quite
well
perfectly
then
she
said
why
go
away
i
in
slack
water
i
have
no
talk
i
bore
you
good
night
the
next
day
having
found
the
morning
quite
intolerably
long
he
approached
her
directly
they
were
alone
on
the
difficult
subject
of
husbands
it
no
good
ingeborg
he
said
yes
i
going
to
call
you
ingeborg
we
fellow
pilgrims
you
and
i
along
this
rocky
ridiculousness
called
life
and
we
soon
be
dead
and
so
my
dear
let
us
be
friends
for
just
this
little
while
oh
but
of
course
of
course
it
no
good
you
know
barring
certain
very
obvious
subjects
because
of
that
idiotic
prepossession
one
has
for
what
is
known
as
good
taste
the
only
really
living
thing
is
bad
taste
all
the
preliminaries
to
real
union
union
of
any
sort
mind
or
body
consist
in
the
chucking
away
of
reticences
and
cautions
and
proprieties
and
each
single
preliminary
is
in
bad
taste
if
we
going
to
be
friends
we
have
to
go
in
for
that
bad
taste
execrable
taste
now
he
stopped
well
she
was
looking
at
him
in
a
kind
of
alarm
this
was
the
longest
speech
by
far
he
had
made
and
she
could
not
imagine
what
was
coming
at
the
end
he
was
busy
as
usual
flinging
her
on
to
paper
the
number
of
his
studies
of
her
was
by
this
time
something
monstrous
and
was
glancing
at
her
swiftly
and
professionally
at
every
sentence
about
husbands
tell
me
what
you
think
about
husbands
about
husbands
but
not
bad
taste
she
said
tell
me
what
you
think
about
them
well
they
people
one
is
very
fond
of
she
said
with
her
hands
clasped
round
her
knees
oh
you
find
that
yes
do
you
i
never
had
one
the
advantages
of
being
a
woman
they
people
one
is
fond
of
once
and
for
all
they
rescue
one
from
redchester
they
good
and
kind
they
help
one
roll
up
great
balls
of
common
memories
and
all
the
memories
grow
somehow
into
tender
things
at
last
and
they
patient
even
when
they
found
out
how
tiresome
one
is
they
still
go
on
being
patient
and
one
loves
them
and
they
love
you
she
flushed
of
course
she
said
you
amusing
with
your
of
courses
and
once
for
alls
really
you
know
there
are
no
such
things
nothing
necessarily
follows
i
mean
not
when
you
get
to
human
beings
ingeborg
fidgeted
too
well
did
she
know
the
dishonesty
of
her
of
course
too
well
did
she
remember
the
sudden
switching
off
after
zoppot
of
robert
love
but
the
rest
was
strictly
true
anyhow
she
thought
she
did
love
him
dear
robert
the
difference
between
him
and
an
amazing
friend
like
ingram
was
she
explained
to
herself
that
she
was
interested
in
ingram
profoundly
interested
and
she
was
not
interested
in
robert
that
she
supposed
was
because
she
loved
robert
perfect
love
she
said
to
herself
watching
with
careful
attention
the
approach
of
a
hairy
and
rather
awful
caterpillar
across
the
path
towards
her
shoes
perfect
love
cast
out
a
lot
of
things
besides
fear
it
cast
out
for
instance
conversation
and
interest
which
one
could
very
well
have
without
conversation
interest
of
course
was
an
altogether
feeling
compared
to
love
and
because
it
was
it
was
noisier
expressing
itself
with
a
copiousness
unnecessary
when
one
got
to
the
higher
stages
of
feeling
one
loved
one
robert
and
one
kept
quiet
far
the
highest
thing
was
to
love
but
she
drew
her
feet
up
quickly
under
her
how
very
interesting
it
was
being
interested
well
he
said
looking
at
her
go
on
well
but
i
ca
go
on
because
i
finished
there
is
any
more
it
a
soon
exhausted
subject
that
because
it
so
simple
and
so
so
dear
you
know
where
you
are
with
husbands
you
mean
you
know
you
not
anywhere
oh
she
said
throwing
back
her
head
and
facing
him
courageously
how
you
do
and
anyhow
she
added
if
that
were
true
it
would
be
a
very
placid
and
restful
state
to
be
in
negation
death
do
you
find
it
placid
and
restful
with
me
no
she
said
quickly
he
put
down
his
brushes
and
stared
at
her
what
a
mercy
he
said
what
a
mercy
i
was
beginning
to
be
afraid
you
did
by
the
end
of
the
third
week
an
odd
thing
had
happened
he
was
no
nearer
piercing
through
her
outer
husk
to
any
emotions
she
might
possess
than
before
but
she
astonishingly
had
pierced
through
his
the
outer
husk
of
ingram
at
this
time
and
for
some
years
previously
was
a
desire
at
all
costs
to
dodge
boredom
to
get
tight
hold
of
anything
that
promised
to
excite
him
squeeze
it
with
diligence
till
the
last
drop
of
entertainment
had
been
extracted
and
then
let
it
go
again
considerably
crumpled
it
was
the
kind
of
husk
that
causes
divergences
of
opinion
with
one
wife
and
behind
it
sat
wrapped
in
flame
the
thing
that
was
with
him
untouchably
first
his
work
he
did
not
know
how
or
why
but
in
that
third
week
ingeborg
got
through
this
husk
and
became
mixed
up
in
a
curious
inextricable
way
with
the
flaming
holy
thing
inside
high
above
immeasurably
above
any
interest
he
had
ever
felt
in
women
was
his
work
the
divers
with
which
his
past
bristled
as
an
ancient
churchyard
bristles
with
battered
tombstones
had
all
been
conducted
as
it
were
on
his
doorstep
he
came
out
to
the
lady
the
lady
destined
so
soon
to
be
a
tombstone
often
with
passion
sometimes
with
illusions
and
always
with
immense
goodwill
to
believe
that
here
was
the
real
thing
at
last
but
she
never
came
in
she
might
and
did
catch
cold
there
for
anything
he
cared
she
should
never
cross
the
threshold
and
start
interfering
delaying
coming
between
in
the
end
she
got
left
out
there
alone
along
with
the
scraper
feeling
chilly
and
here
was
ingeborg
through
the
door
and
not
interfering
not
delaying
but
positively
furthering
the
increasing
beauty
of
his
studies
of
her
first
made
him
suspect
it
their
beauty
began
to
surprise
him
to
take
him
unawares
as
though
it
were
a
thing
outside
and
apart
from
his
own
will
he
had
found
so
few
things
in
humanity
that
seemed
beautiful
and
his
pictures
had
been
pictures
of
resentments
impish
and
wonderful
exposures
by
a
master
of
the
littleness
at
the
back
of
brave
shows
for
a
fortnight
now
he
had
sketched
and
sketched
and
splashed
about
with
colour
just
as
an
excuse
for
staying
on
in
the
desire
to
make
love
to
ingeborg
to
refresh
himself
for
a
space
at
this
unexpectedly
limpid
little
spring
he
had
been
attracted
irritated
increasingly
attracted
greatly
exasperated
greatly
attracted
he
had
grown
eager
determined
almost
anxious
at
last
but
these
various
emotions
had
been
felt
by
him
strictly
on
his
doorstep
she
was
merely
a
substitute
and
at
that
only
a
temporary
substitute
for
the
caucasus
then
in
the
third
week
he
perceived
that
she
had
left
off
being
that
she
was
no
longer
just
an
odd
little
thing
an
attractive
delicious
little
thing
to
him
of
the
colouring
he
best
loved
the
fairness
the
whiteness
a
thing
that
offered
up
incense
before
him
with
unflagging
zeal
a
thing
full
of
contentments
and
generous
ready
friendship
she
still
was
all
that
but
she
was
more
like
adam
when
god
breathed
into
his
nostrils
the
breath
of
life
she
had
become
a
living
soul
and
that
of
which
she
was
the
living
soul
was
his
work
not
only
her
soul
but
his
had
begun
to
get
into
his
studies
of
her
each
successive
study
unveiled
more
of
an
inner
beauty
each
fixed
into
form
and
colour
qualities
in
her
and
qualities
in
him
who
apprehended
them
that
he
had
not
known
were
there
it
was
as
if
he
watched
while
his
hand
was
held
and
guided
sure
swift
touch
by
sure
swift
touch
by
some
one
else
some
one
altogether
greater
some
splendid
master
from
some
splendid
other
world
who
laid
hold
of
him
as
one
lays
hold
of
a
learner
and
showed
him
these
things
and
said
at
each
fresh
stroke
look
this
is
what
she
is
like
the
essence
of
her
the
spirit
and
see
it
is
what
you
are
like
too
for
you
recognise
it
in
that
third
week
late
one
afternoon
they
went
on
the
lake
ingeborg
paddled
slowly
along
the
middle
of
the
quiet
water
towards
the
sunset
and
ingram
sat
at
the
other
end
with
his
back
to
it
and
watched
her
becoming
more
and
more
transfigured
as
the
sun
got
lower
very
early
in
their
acquaintance
he
had
conveyed
to
her
that
she
ought
always
to
wear
white
and
that
hats
were
foolish
and
unnecessary
therefore
she
did
wear
white
and
sat
hatless
in
the
punt
the
light
blinded
her
she
could
see
nothing
of
him
but
a
dark
hunch
against
a
blaze
of
sky
but
when
she
wanted
to
turn
the
punt
towards
the
relief
of
the
shadows
along
the
shore
he
instantly
stopped
her
and
told
her
to
keep
on
straight
into
the
eye
of
the
sun
but
i
ca
see
she
said
but
i
can
it
for
my
picture
it
going
to
be
a
study
of
light
shall
you
be
able
to
do
it
from
the
sketches
no
from
you
why
you
said
you
could
anywhere
here
because
there
was
a
proper
place
there
is
i
going
to
do
it
in
venice
in
my
studio
there
but
can
you
from
memory
no
from
you
she
laughed
how
i
wish
i
could
she
said
i
ache
and
ache
to
see
things
to
go
to
italy
she
sighed
the
vision
of
it
was
unendurably
beautiful
well
you
have
to
not
only
because
it
monstrous
you
should
monstrous
and
shocking
and
unbelievable
that
you
should
be
stuck
in
kökensee
for
years
on
end
and
never
see
or
hear
or
know
any
of
the
big
things
of
life
but
because
you
ca
spoil
my
great
picture
the
greatest
i
shall
ever
have
done
robert
could
never
leave
his
work
i
do
want
robert
to
leave
anything
it
you
i
going
to
paint
and
i
ca
do
without
you
how
very
awkward
she
smiled
because
robert
ca
do
without
me
either
he
plunged
his
arm
into
the
water
with
sudden
extreme
violence
scooped
a
handful
of
it
high
into
the
air
and
dashed
it
back
again
it
had
seemed
to
him
obvious
throughout
his
life
that
when
it
came
to
the
supremest
things
not
only
did
one
give
up
everything
oneself
for
them
but
other
people
were
bound
to
give
up
everything
too
the
world
and
the
centuries
were
to
be
enriched
he
had
a
magnificent
private
faith
in
his
position
as
a
creator
and
it
was
the
duty
of
those
persons
who
were
needful
to
the
process
to
deliver
themselves
their
souls
and
bodies
up
to
him
in
what
he
was
convinced
was
an
entirely
reasonable
sacrifice
if
any
one
were
necessary
to
his
work
even
only
indirectly
by
keeping
him
content
while
he
did
it
so
that
he
could
produce
his
best
it
was
that
person
duty
to
come
to
his
help
a
paramount
duty
passing
the
love
of
home
or
family
he
would
do
as
much
he
was
convinced
for
some
one
else
who
should
instead
of
him
possess
the
gift
here
had
he
been
in
a
state
of
dissatisfaction
and
restlessness
for
years
and
his
work
though
his
reputation
leapt
along
was
he
very
well
knew
not
what
it
could
have
been
boredom
had
seized
him
a
great
disgust
of
humanity
there
had
been
harassing
private
complications
his
wife
had
turned
tiresome
refusing
to
understand
and
now
he
had
found
this
this
thing
he
thought
looking
at
her
in
the
kind
of
fury
that
seized
him
at
the
merest
approach
to
any
thwarting
that
touched
his
work
of
light
and
fire
and
cleanness
this
little
hidden
precious
stone
hidden
for
him
waiting
for
him
to
come
and
make
of
her
a
supreme
work
of
art
and
she
was
putting
forward
obstacles
philistine
difficulties
ludicrous
trivialities
robert
in
short
to
the
achievement
of
it
do
you
realise
he
said
leaning
forward
and
staring
at
her
with
his
strange
pale
eyes
what
it
means
to
be
painted
by
me
my
utter
glorification
she
answered
my
utter
pride
he
waved
his
hand
impatiently
it
means
he
said
and
in
this
case
it
would
supremely
mean
another
one
added
to
the
great
possessions
of
the
world
oh
said
ingeborg
and
then
after
a
slight
holding
of
her
breath
again
oh
she
was
his
voice
came
out
of
the
black
shadow
of
him
at
her
through
clenched
teeth
which
gave
it
a
strange
quality
she
felt
with
the
sunset
blinding
her
and
that
black
figure
in
front
of
her
and
the
intense
clenchedness
of
the
voice
issuing
from
it
in
the
presence
of
immensities
she
wondered
whether
it
would
have
been
any
worse
instantly
she
corrected
the
word
it
had
been
the
merest
slip
of
her
brain
to
more
glorious
to
be
sitting
in
a
punt
with
simultaneously
shakespeare
sophocles
homer
and
the
entire
renaissance
weak
a
thing
though
her
paddle
was
she
pressed
it
tightly
in
her
arms
it
a
great
responsibility
she
said
lamely
of
course
it
is
he
said
still
in
that
clenched
voice
and
it
has
to
be
met
greatly
but
what
have
here
this
picture
i
feel
it
in
me
i
tell
you
i
feel
it
and
know
it
going
to
be
the
crowning
work
of
my
life
going
to
be
a
thing
of
living
beauty
throughout
the
generations
going
to
be
the
portrait
of
a
lady
that
draws
the
world
to
look
at
it
during
all
the
ages
after
we
are
dead
he
broke
off
he
left
off
hurling
the
sentences
at
her
he
began
to
beg
ingeborg
he
said
you
cleaned
me
up
and
glorified
me
like
the
sunshine
during
this
stay
here
without
meaning
to
clean
or
bothering
to
clean
a
bit
you
become
the
eyes
of
the
universe
to
me
and
if
it
were
for
you
now
the
whole
thing
would
be
an
eyeless
monster
and
a
mask
and
a
horror
without
you
why
even
during
the
mornings
here
when
i
may
come
to
you
i
like
a
ship
laid
up
in
an
port
an
aeroplane
without
an
engine
a
book
with
the
first
and
last
pages
lost
the
mornings
are
like
a
realistic
novel
of
gissing
after
a
fairy
tale
the
afternoons
are
like
a
bright
vision
in
a
crystal
like
a
dream
like
one
of
the
drops
into
fairyland
quite
common
people
sometimes
take
you
the
littlest
thing
and
you
leave
the
most
enormous
blank
it
extraordinary
the
of
things
directly
away
from
you
i
did
poor
work
before
i
found
you
poor
i
mean
compared
to
what
i
know
it
might
be
and
i
do
none
at
all
or
mere
ruins
if
i
have
to
work
without
you
now
work
is
everything
to
me
and
i
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
it
if
you
not
there
jeer
at
me
if
you
like
jeer
at
me
for
a
parasite
i
been
an
empty
thing
without
you
all
these
years
you
ca
let
me
go
again
you
ca
let
me
drop
back
into
the
old
angers
into
the
old
falling
short
of
the
highest
you
the
spirit
of
my
inmost
you
my
response
my
reality
my
glorification
my
transmuter
into
a
god
and
the
picture
i
going
to
do
of
you
will
be
the
portrait
of
a
lady
who
gave
him
back
his
soul
chapter
xxx
she
stared
at
his
black
outline
helplessly
she
was
overwhelmed
what
could
a
respectable
pastor
wife
say
to
such
a
speech
it
had
the
genuine
ring
she
did
not
believe
it
all
not
that
is
the
portions
of
it
which
that
back
part
of
her
mind
the
part
that
leapt
about
with
disconcerting
agility
of
irrelevant
questioning
when
it
most
to
called
the
decorations
for
how
could
any
one
like
ingram
really
think
those
wonderful
things
of
any
one
like
her
but
she
no
longer
suspected
him
of
making
fun
he
meant
some
of
it
what
was
underneath
it
he
meant
she
felt
she
was
scared
and
at
the
same
time
caught
up
into
rapture
was
it
possible
that
at
last
she
was
wanted
at
last
she
could
help
some
one
he
wanted
her
he
ingram
of
all
people
in
the
world
and
only
a
few
weeks
ago
she
had
been
going
about
kökensee
so
completely
unwanted
that
if
a
dog
wagged
its
tail
at
her
she
had
been
glad
it
it
a
great
responsibility
she
murmured
a
second
time
while
her
face
was
transfigured
with
more
than
just
the
sunset
it
was
for
there
was
robert
robert
she
felt
even
at
this
moment
in
the
uplifted
state
when
everything
seems
easy
and
possible
would
not
understand
robert
had
no
need
of
her
himself
but
he
would
not
let
her
go
for
all
that
to
venice
robert
had
altogether
not
grasped
ingram
importance
in
the
world
he
could
not
perhaps
be
expected
to
for
he
did
not
like
art
robert
she
was
deadly
certain
would
not
leave
his
work
for
an
hour
to
take
her
anywhere
for
any
purpose
however
high
and
without
him
how
could
she
go
to
venice
people
did
go
to
venice
with
somebody
who
was
their
husband
they
might
go
there
with
a
whole
trainful
of
indifferent
persons
if
they
were
indifferent
directly
you
liked
somebody
directly
it
became
wonderful
to
be
taken
there
to
be
shown
the
way
looked
after
prevented
from
getting
lost
you
did
go
it
simply
as
with
kissing
was
a
matter
of
liking
society
seemed
based
on
hate
you
might
kiss
the
people
you
did
want
to
kiss
you
might
go
to
venice
with
any
amount
of
strangers
because
you
did
like
strangers
and
in
a
case
like
this
oh
in
a
case
like
this
she
suddenly
cried
out
aloud
flinging
the
paddle
into
the
punt
and
twisting
her
hands
together
overcome
by
the
vision
of
the
glories
that
were
going
to
be
missed
when
it
so
important
when
it
so
tremendously
matters
to
be
caught
by
convention
he
had
got
her
the
swift
conviction
flashed
through
him
as
he
jerked
his
feet
out
of
the
way
of
the
paddle
got
her
differently
from
what
he
had
first
aimed
at
perhaps
still
incredibly
without
but
she
would
come
to
venice
she
would
come
and
sit
to
him
he
was
going
to
do
his
masterpiece
and
the
rest
was
inevitable
how
do
you
mean
he
said
his
eyes
on
her
to
think
the
great
picture
never
going
to
be
painted
and
why
because
of
convention
because
of
all
these
mad
rules
she
was
twisting
her
fingers
about
in
the
way
she
did
when
much
stirred
it
doomed
she
said
doomed
and
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
amazement
of
aggrievedness
of
actually
tears
ingeborg
he
began
do
you
know
how
i
longed
to
go
just
to
italy
she
interrupted
with
just
the
same
headlong
impulsiveness
that
had
swept
her
into
travel
bureau
years
before
how
i
read
about
it
and
thought
about
it
till
i
sick
with
longing
why
i
looked
out
trains
and
the
things
i
read
i
know
all
about
its
treasures
oh
not
only
its
treasures
of
art
and
old
histories
but
other
treasures
light
and
colour
and
scent
the
things
i
love
now
the
things
i
know
now
in
pale
mean
little
visions
i
know
all
sorts
of
things
i
know
there
a
great
rush
of
wistaria
along
the
wall
as
you
go
up
to
the
certosa
covering
its
whole
length
with
bunch
upon
bunch
of
flowers
which
certosa
pavia
pavia
and
all
the
open
space
in
front
of
it
is
drenched
in
april
with
that
divinest
smell
and
i
know
about
the
little
red
monthly
roses
scrambling
in
and
out
of
the
campo
santo
above
genoa
in
january
in
january
red
roses
in
january
while
here
and
i
know
about
the
fireflies
in
the
gardens
round
florence
that
may
early
may
while
here
we
still
sit
up
against
the
stoves
and
i
know
about
the
chestnut
woods
real
chestnuts
that
you
eat
afterwards
along
the
steep
sides
of
the
lakes
miles
and
miles
of
them
with
deep
green
moss
underneath
and
i
know
about
the
queer
black
grapes
that
sting
your
tongue
and
fill
the
world
with
a
smell
of
strawberries
in
september
and
what
the
appian
way
looks
like
in
april
when
it
is
still
waving
flowery
grass
burning
in
an
immensity
of
light
and
i
know
the
of
the
houses
in
the
old
parts
of
rome
and
that
the
irises
they
sell
there
in
the
streets
are
like
pale
pink
coral
and
all
one
needs
to
do
to
see
these
things
for
oneself
is
to
catch
a
train
at
meuk
day
one
could
catch
that
train
at
meuk
every
day
it
starts
and
one
is
never
there
and
kökensee
would
roll
back
like
a
curtain
and
the
world
be
changed
like
a
garment
like
an
old
stiff
clayey
garment
like
an
old
shroud
into
all
think
of
it
what
a
background
what
a
background
for
the
painting
of
the
greatest
picture
in
the
world
she
stopped
and
took
up
the
paddle
again
i
wonder
she
said
with
sudden
listlessness
why
i
say
all
this
to
you
because
said
ingram
in
a
low
voice
you
my
sister
and
my
mate
she
dipped
the
paddle
into
the
water
and
turned
the
punt
towards
home
oh
well
she
said
the
enthusiasm
gone
out
of
her
the
water
and
the
sky
and
the
forests
along
the
banks
and
the
spire
of
the
kökensee
church
at
the
end
of
the
lake
looked
dark
and
sad
going
this
way
at
first
she
could
see
nothing
after
the
blinding
light
of
the
other
direction
then
everything
cleared
into
dun
colour
and
bleakness
how
one
talks
she
said
i
say
things
enthusiastic
things
and
you
say
things
beautiful
kind
things
and
it
all
no
good
is
it
not
only
do
we
say
them
but
we
going
to
do
them
coming
with
me
to
venice
my
dear
have
you
read
in
those
travel
books
of
yours
what
the
lagoons
look
like
at
sunset
she
made
an
impatient
movement
ingeborg
let
us
reason
together
i
ca
reason
well
listen
to
me
then
doing
it
by
myself
and
he
proceeded
to
do
it
all
the
way
down
the
lake
he
did
it
and
up
along
the
path
through
the
rye
and
afterwards
in
the
garden
pacing
up
and
down
in
the
gathering
twilight
beneath
the
he
did
it
wonderful
he
thought
in
that
submerged
portion
of
the
back
of
his
mind
where
imps
of
criticism
sat
and
scoffed
the
trouble
one
takes
at
the
beginning
over
a
woman
she
let
him
talk
listening
quite
in
silence
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
her
eyes
observing
every
incident
of
the
pale
summer
path
the
broken
twigs
scattered
on
it
some
withered
she
had
worn
that
afternoon
a
column
of
ants
over
which
she
stepped
carefully
each
time
till
the
stars
came
out
and
the
owls
appeared
he
eagerly
reasoned
he
talked
of
the
folly
of
conventions
of
the
ridiculous
way
people
deliberately
chain
themselves
up
padlock
themselves
to
some
bogey
of
a
theory
of
right
and
wrong
are
so
deeply
in
their
souls
improper
that
they
dare
not
loose
their
chain
one
inch
or
unlock
themselves
an
instant
to
go
on
the
simplest
of
adventures
such
people
he
explained
were
in
their
essence
profoundly
and
incurably
immoral
they
needed
the
straight
waistcoat
and
padded
room
of
principles
their
only
hope
lay
in
chains
with
them
he
said
sane
human
beings
such
as
you
and
i
have
nothing
to
do
but
what
about
the
others
the
free
spirits
increasing
daily
in
number
the
fundamentally
fine
and
clean
who
wanted
no
safeguards
and
were
engaged
in
demonstrating
continually
to
the
world
that
two
friends
man
and
woman
could
very
well
say
travel
together
be
away
seeing
beautiful
things
together
with
the
simplicity
of
children
or
of
a
brother
and
sister
and
return
safe
after
the
longest
absence
with
not
a
memory
between
them
that
they
need
regret
why
there
were
he
instanced
names
ones
of
people
who
he
said
had
gone
and
come
back
openly
frankly
determined
demonstrators
for
the
public
good
of
the
natural
and
then
there
were
he
instanced
more
names
names
of
people
even
ingeborg
had
heard
of
and
finding
this
unexpectedly
impressive
he
went
on
inventing
with
a
growing
recklessness
taking
any
people
enough
to
have
been
heard
of
by
ingeborg
and
sending
them
to
venice
in
twos
in
haphazard
juxtapositions
that
presently
began
to
amuse
him
tremendously
no
doubt
they
had
gone
or
would
go
sooner
or
later
he
thought
greatly
tickled
by
the
vision
of
some
of
his
couples
there
was
lilienkopf
you
know
the
african
millionaire
went
to
venice
with
lady
missenden
he
flung
back
his
head
and
laughed
the
thought
of
lilienkopf
and
lady
missenden
they
too
came
back
without
a
regret
he
said
and
laughed
and
laughed
she
watched
him
gravely
she
knew
neither
lilienkopf
nor
lady
missenden
and
was
not
in
the
mood
for
laughter
even
bishops
go
said
ingram
they
go
for
walking
tours
but
not
to
venice
no
to
shrines
why
cathedral
cities
are
with
secret
pilgrims
but
why
secret
you
said
well
careful
pilgrims
pilgrims
who
make
careful
departures
one
has
to
depart
carefully
you
know
not
because
of
oneself
but
because
of
offending
those
who
are
not
imbued
with
the
pilgrim
spirit
for
instance
robert
oh
robert
i
his
face
if
i
suggested
he
should
let
me
be
a
pilgrim
but
of
course
you
must
suggest
what
she
stood
still
and
looked
up
at
him
just
go
of
course
it
was
what
you
did
when
you
ran
away
to
lucerne
if
suggested
you
never
have
got
there
and
you
did
that
for
merest
fun
while
this
he
looked
at
her
and
the
impishness
died
out
of
his
face
why
this
he
said
after
a
silence
this
is
the
giving
back
to
me
of
my
soul
i
need
you
my
dear
i
need
you
as
a
dark
room
needs
a
lamp
as
a
cold
room
needs
a
fire
my
work
will
be
nothing
without
you
how
can
it
be
with
no
light
to
see
by
it
will
be
empty
dead
it
will
be
like
the
sky
without
the
star
that
makes
it
beautiful
the
hay
without
the
flower
that
scents
it
the
cloak
one
is
given
by
god
to
keep
out
the
cold
and
wickedness
of
life
slipped
off
because
there
was
no
clasp
to
hold
it
tight
over
one
heart
she
began
to
warm
again
she
had
been
a
little
cooled
while
he
laughed
by
himself
over
lady
missenden
unregretted
journeyings
to
go
to
italy
to
go
to
italy
at
all
but
to
go
under
such
conditions
wanted
indispensable
to
the
creation
of
a
great
work
of
art
it
was
the
most
amazing
cluster
of
joys
surely
that
had
ever
been
offered
to
woman
how
long
would
i
have
to
be
away
she
asked
how
long
is
the
shortest
time
one
wants
for
a
picture
he
airily
told
her
a
month
would
be
enough
and
on
her
exclaiming
immediately
reduced
it
to
a
week
but
getting
there
and
coming
back
well
say
ten
days
he
said
surely
you
could
get
away
for
ten
days
to
do
he
added
looking
at
her
some
shopping
in
berlin
but
i
do
want
to
shop
oh
ingeborg
you
relapsing
into
your
condition
again
of
course
you
do
want
to
shop
of
course
you
do
want
to
go
to
berlin
but
it
what
you
say
to
robert
oh
she
said
but
is
that
would
that
be
rather
why
ca
you
be
as
simple
as
when
you
went
to
lucerne
you
wanted
to
go
so
you
went
and
you
were
leaving
your
father
who
tremendously
needed
you
you
were
his
right
hand
here
you
nobody
right
hand
i
not
asking
you
to
do
anything
that
would
hurt
robert
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
arrange
so
that
he
knows
nothing
beyond
berlin
surely
after
these
years
he
can
let
you
go
away
for
ten
days
she
walked
with
him
in
silence
down
the
lilac
path
as
far
as
the
gate
into
the
yard
she
was
exalted
but
her
exaltation
was
shot
with
doubt
what
he
said
sounded
so
entirely
right
so
obviously
right
she
had
no
reasoning
to
put
up
against
it
she
longed
intolerably
to
go
she
was
quite
certain
it
was
a
high
and
beautiful
thing
to
go
and
yet
herr
dremmel
laboratory
windows
were
open
for
the
evening
was
heavy
and
quiet
and
they
could
see
him
in
the
lamplight
with
disregarded
moths
fluttering
round
his
head
bent
over
his
work
good
night
ingram
called
in
at
the
window
with
the
peculiar
cordial
voice
reserved
for
husbands
but
herr
dremmel
was
too
much
engrossed
to
hear
towards
two
there
was
a
thunderstorm
and
sheets
of
rain
and
when
ingeborg
got
up
next
morning
it
was
to
find
the
summer
gone
the
house
was
cold
and
dark
and
mournful
and
it
was
raining
steadily
looking
out
of
the
front
door
at
the
yard
that
had
been
so
bright
and
dusty
for
five
weeks
she
thought
she
had
never
seen
such
a
sudden
desolation
the
rain
rained
on
the
ivy
with
a
dull
dripping
the
pig
standing
solitary
in
the
mud
was
the
wettest
pig
the
puddles
were
all
over
little
buttons
made
of
raindrops
invariably
after
a
thunderstorm
the
weather
broke
up
for
days
sometimes
for
weeks
what
would
she
and
ingram
do
now
she
thought
what
in
the
world
would
they
do
now
shut
up
in
the
dark
little
parlour
he
unable
to
work
and
no
walks
and
no
punting
why
he
go
of
course
and
the
was
at
an
end
a
week
of
this
said
herr
dremmel
coming
out
of
his
laboratory
to
stand
on
the
doorstep
and
rub
his
hands
in
satisfaction
a
week
of
this
will
save
the
situation
which
situation
robert
she
asked
her
mind
as
confused
and
dull
as
the
untidy
grey
sky
he
looked
at
her
oh
yes
she
said
hastily
of
course
the
experiment
fields
yes
i
suppose
this
is
what
they
been
wanting
all
through
that
heavenly
weather
it
was
a
weather
said
herr
dremmel
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
heaven
and
everything
to
do
with
hell
devils
no
doubt
might
grow
in
it
wax
fat
and
big
and
devils
used
to
drought
but
certainly
not
the
kindly
fruits
of
the
earth
and
for
an
instant
he
gave
his
mind
to
reflection
on
how
great
might
be
the
barrier
created
between
two
people
living
together
by
a
different
taste
in
weather
ingram
arrived
at
two
in
a
state
of
extreme
irritation
he
splashed
through
the
farmyard
with
the
collar
of
his
coat
turned
up
and
angrily
holding
an
umbrella
in
his
mood
it
seemed
to
him
entirely
absurd
and
unworthy
to
be
wading
through
an
east
prussian
farmyard
mess
in
pouring
rain
beneath
an
umbrella
in
order
to
sit
with
a
woman
he
wanted
to
be
at
work
he
was
obsessed
by
his
picture
he
was
in
the
fever
to
begin
that
seizes
the
artist
after
idleness
the
fever
to
get
away
to
be
off
back
to
the
real
concern
of
life
the
fierce
fever
of
creation
he
had
not
yet
had
to
come
into
the
house
on
his
daily
visits
and
when
he
got
into
the
passage
he
was
immediately
and
deeply
offended
by
the
smell
that
met
him
of
what
an
hour
before
had
been
a
german
dinner
the
smell
came
out
as
it
were
weighty
with
welcome
it
advanced
it
was
massive
deep
enveloping
the
front
door
stood
open
but
nothing
but
great
space
of
time
could
rid
the
house
in
the
afternoons
of
that
peculiar
and
smell
he
was
shocked
to
think
his
white
and
golden
one
his
little
image
of
living
ivory
and
living
gold
must
needs
on
a
day
like
this
be
swathed
about
in
such
fumes
must
sit
in
them
and
breathe
them
and
that
his
communings
with
her
were
going
to
be
conducted
through
a
heavy
curtain
of
what
seemed
to
be
different
varieties
of
cabbage
and
all
of
them
malignant
the
narrow
gloom
of
the
house
its
unpiercedness
on
that
north
side
by
any
but
the
coldest
light
its
abrupt
ending
almost
at
once
in
the
kitchen
and
servant
part
struck
him
as
incredibly
preposterously
sordid
what
a
place
to
put
a
woman
in
what
a
place
having
put
her
in
it
to
neglect
her
in
the
thought
of
herr
dremmel
neglects
those
neglects
that
had
made
his
own
stay
possible
and
pleasant
infuriated
him
how
dare
he
thought
ingram
angrily
wiping
his
boots
herr
dremmel
kökensee
everything
connected
with
the
place
except
ingeborg
seemed
in
his
changed
mood
ignoble
he
forgot
the
weeks
of
sunshine
there
had
been
the
large
afternoons
in
the
garden
and
forest
and
the
floating
on
great
stretches
of
calm
water
and
just
hated
everything
kökensee
was
distant
alien
ugly
dirty
dripping
ingeborg
herself
when
she
came
running
out
of
the
parlour
to
him
into
the
concentrated
cabbage
of
the
corridor
seemed
less
shining
drabber
than
before
and
so
unfortunately
active
was
his
imagination
so
quick
to
riot
that
almost
he
could
fancy
for
one
dreadful
instant
as
he
looked
at
her
that
there
was
cabbage
in
her
very
hair
ingeborg
he
said
the
moment
he
was
in
the
parlour
i
ca
stand
this
i
ca
endure
sort
of
thing
you
know
he
rubbed
both
his
hands
through
his
hair
and
gnawed
at
a
finger
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
hers
in
a
kind
of
angry
reproach
i
was
afraid
you
would
like
it
she
said
apologetically
feeling
somehow
as
though
the
weather
were
her
fault
like
it
and
i
ca
idle
here
any
more
you
ca
expect
me
to
hang
on
here
any
more
oh
but
i
never
she
interrupted
hastily
surprised
and
distressed
that
she
should
have
produced
any
such
impression
well
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
your
making
difficulties
about
coming
away
your
wanting
such
a
lot
of
persuading
he
stopped
in
his
quick
pacing
of
the
little
room
and
stared
at
her
why
you
giving
me
he
said
in
a
voice
of
high
astonishment
and
as
she
stood
looking
at
him
with
her
lips
fallen
apart
her
eyes
full
of
a
new
and
anxious
questioning
he
began
to
pace
about
again
across
and
round
and
up
and
down
the
unworthy
little
room
god
he
said
swiftly
pacing
how
i
do
hate
and
indeed
it
seemed
to
him
wholly
amazingly
monstrous
that
his
great
new
work
should
be
being
held
up
a
day
by
any
scruples
of
any
sort
whatever
this
grey
headache
of
a
sky
he
said
jerking
himself
for
a
moment
to
the
window
this
mud
this
muggy
chilliness
but
she
began
the
days
here
are
lines
just
length
without
breadth
or
thickness
or
any
substance
but
surely
till
i
feel
in
a
sort
of
well
in
this
place
out
of
sight
of
faith
and
kindliness
you
shutting
them
out
he
turned
on
her
you
deliberately
shutting
them
out
putting
the
lid
on
the
glory
of
light
and
life
being
an
extinguisher
for
the
sake
of
nothing
and
nobody
at
all
just
for
the
sake
of
a
phantom
of
an
idea
about
robert
but
surely
she
said
i
bored
and
bored
here
this
morning
was
a
frightful
thing
i
in
this
state
even
make
a
sketch
of
you
i
spoil
it
it
rain
for
ever
i
ca
stay
in
this
room
i
begin
to
rave
but
of
course
you
ca
stay
in
it
of
course
you
must
go
go
when
i
ca
work
without
you
when
you
so
everything
to
me
that
during
the
hours
i
away
from
you
little
things
you
said
and
done
float
in
my
mind
like
little
shining
phosphorescent
things
in
a
dark
cold
sea
and
i
creep
into
warm
little
thoughts
of
you
like
some
creature
that
shivers
and
gets
back
into
its
nest
i
told
you
i
was
a
parasite
i
told
you
i
depend
on
you
i
told
you
you
make
me
exist
for
myself
how
can
you
let
me
beg
how
can
you
let
beg
they
stood
facing
each
other
in
the
middle
of
the
room
his
light
eyes
blazing
down
into
hers
you
you
sure
i
be
back
in
ten
days
she
said
and
he
had
the
presence
of
mind
not
to
catch
her
to
his
heart
chapter
xxxi
from
the
moment
she
said
she
would
go
ingram
was
a
changed
creature
he
became
brisk
cheerful
not
a
trace
was
left
of
the
exasperated
wet
man
who
had
come
round
through
the
rain
and
there
were
no
more
poetic
images
he
was
reassuringly
like
a
pleased
elder
brother
a
brother
all
alert
contentment
the
table
was
cleared
by
his
swift
hands
of
the
litter
of
her
english
studies
and
the
map
out
of
the
spread
on
it
and
with
the
help
of
an
old
baedeker
his
sharp
eyes
had
noticed
lurking
in
a
corner
he
expounded
to
her
what
she
was
to
do
he
wrote
down
her
train
from
meuk
to
allenstein
and
her
train
from
allenstein
to
berlin
he
told
her
where
she
was
to
stay
the
night
in
berlin
a
city
he
appeared
to
know
intimately
and
he
made
a
drawing
in
pencil
of
the
streets
that
led
to
it
from
the
station
the
dotted
line
he
said
explaining
his
drawing
is
little
footsteps
she
was
to
stay
at
one
of
those
refuges
for
timid
ladies
with
connections
in
the
church
which
are
scattered
about
berlin
and
called
places
where
besides
coffee
and
rolls
there
are
prayers
and
a
harmonium
for
breakfast
she
was
to
meet
him
next
day
at
the
anhalter
station
that
happy
for
the
south
and
he
would
leave
kökensee
at
once
perhaps
that
evening
and
wait
for
her
in
berlin
they
would
proceed
to
venice
intermittently
getting
out
of
the
train
at
various
points
in
order
to
see
certain
things
there
was
a
walk
he
wanted
to
take
her
across
the
hills
of
lake
maggiore
for
instance
but
i
only
ten
days
she
reminded
him
oh
you
see
one
can
do
a
lot
and
there
was
bergamo
he
wanted
to
show
her
she
would
he
assured
her
greatly
love
bergamo
and
certainly
they
would
go
to
pavia
if
only
to
see
if
the
wistaria
were
still
in
flower
her
eyes
danced
the
sight
of
the
map
and
the
was
enough
she
hung
over
him
eagerly
following
his
pointing
finger
as
it
moved
over
mountains
and
lakes
she
was
like
a
schoolboy
watching
the
planning
out
of
his
first
trip
abroad
there
was
no
room
in
her
for
any
thoughts
but
thoughts
of
glee
the
names
were
music
to
her
locarno
cannobio
luino
varese
bergamo
brescia
venice
she
lost
sight
of
the
higher
aspect
of
the
adventure
the
picture
her
position
as
indispensable
assistant
in
the
production
of
a
great
work
her
brain
was
buzzing
with
just
the
idea
of
trains
and
places
and
new
countries
and
utter
fun
after
the
years
of
inaction
in
kökensee
just
to
go
in
a
train
to
berlin
would
have
been
tremendous
enough
to
set
her
blood
pulsing
and
here
she
was
going
on
and
on
farther
and
farther
into
more
and
more
light
more
and
more
colour
and
heat
and
splendour
and
all
new
things
till
actually
at
last
she
would
reach
it
the
heart
of
the
world
and
be
in
italy
oh
she
murmured
but
it
too
to
be
true
and
the
rigi
which
up
to
then
had
been
the
mark
of
her
experience
collapsed
into
a
little
lump
of
pale
indifferent
mould
when
the
tea
began
to
bump
against
the
door
and
she
went
out
to
help
the
servant
ingram
put
every
sign
of
intending
travel
neatly
away
and
by
the
time
herr
dremmel
joined
them
there
was
no
hint
of
anything
anywhere
in
the
room
but
sobriety
except
in
ingeborg
eyes
they
danced
and
danced
she
longed
to
jump
up
and
fling
her
arms
round
robert
neck
and
tell
him
she
was
off
to
italy
she
wanted
him
to
share
her
joy
to
know
how
happy
she
was
she
felt
all
lit
up
and
bright
inside
while
ingram
on
the
contrary
looked
forbiddingly
solemn
he
presently
began
to
make
solemn
comments
on
the
change
in
the
weather
and
after
hearing
herr
dremmel
view
and
sympathising
with
his
gratification
said
that
as
regarded
himself
it
put
an
end
to
his
work
of
preparation
for
the
painting
of
frau
dremmel
portrait
and
therefore
he
was
leaving
the
next
morning
and
would
take
the
opportunity
when
herr
dremmel
presently
retired
to
his
laboratory
of
making
his
farewells
herr
dremmel
expressed
polite
regrets
ingram
politely
thanked
him
ingeborg
felt
suddenly
less
lit
up
and
her
eyes
left
off
dancing
she
wanted
for
some
odd
reason
to
slip
her
hand
into
robert
it
grew
and
grew
on
her
the
desire
to
go
and
sit
very
close
to
robert
if
only
he
would
come
too
if
only
he
would
for
once
take
a
holiday
and
come
and
see
these
beautiful
things
with
her
how
happy
they
would
all
be
it
seemed
a
forlorn
thing
to
leave
him
there
alone
in
the
rain
while
she
went
jaunting
off
to
italy
well
but
he
would
come
he
liked
rain
and
he
would
let
her
go
either
if
she
were
frankly
to
ask
him
to
the
example
of
lady
missenden
or
of
any
of
those
persons
would
not
she
knew
move
him
nor
would
anything
she
could
say
on
the
shameful
absurdity
of
supposing
evil
liberal
though
he
was
and
large
as
were
his
scoffings
at
convention
he
was
not
as
liberal
and
large
she
felt
sure
as
ingram
and
she
suspected
that
the
conventions
he
scoffed
at
were
those
which
did
not
touch
himself
she
could
not
risk
asking
she
must
go
she
must
must
go
yet
she
got
up
impulsively
and
on
the
pretext
of
taking
his
cup
from
him
went
to
him
and
put
her
hand
with
a
little
stroking
movement
on
his
hair
herr
dremmel
did
not
observe
it
but
ingram
did
and
after
tea
and
until
he
left
that
evening
not
to
see
her
again
till
they
met
at
the
anhalter
station
in
berlin
he
was
amazingly
natural
and
ordinary
and
cheery
more
exactly
like
a
brother
than
any
brother
that
had
ever
been
seen
or
imagined
of
course
he
said
quite
at
the
last
turning
back
from
the
doorstep
before
finally
committing
himself
to
the
liquid
masses
of
the
dissolved
farmyard
of
course
i
can
on
you
she
laughed
she
stood
on
the
top
step
with
the
light
of
the
lamp
in
the
passage
behind
her
a
little
torch
of
resolution
and
adventure
and
imagination
well
let
loose
i
going
to
italy
she
said
flinging
out
both
her
arms
as
though
she
would
put
them
round
that
land
of
dreams
and
so
complex
is
man
and
so
simple
in
his
complexity
that
ingram
went
away
in
the
wet
twilight
quite
sincerely
offering
thanks
to
god
but
when
it
came
to
the
moment
of
telling
robert
about
berlin
and
shopping
her
heart
beat
very
uncomfortably
it
was
at
the
next
afternoon
all
day
she
had
been
trying
to
do
it
but
her
tongue
refused
at
breakfast
she
tried
and
at
dinner
she
tried
and
in
between
she
went
twice
to
the
laboratory
door
and
stood
on
the
mat
and
instead
of
going
in
went
away
again
on
the
carefullest
and
there
was
ingram
getting
to
berlin
got
to
berlin
kicking
his
heels
there
waiting
at
after
a
tempestuous
walk
in
the
wet
during
which
as
she
splashed
through
sodden
miles
of
wilderness
she
took
her
gods
to
witness
that
the
thing
should
be
done
that
afternoon
she
did
finally
bring
it
out
she
had
meant
to
say
with
an
immense
naturalness
that
she
wished
to
go
to
berlin
in
order
to
buy
boots
she
had
thought
of
boots
as
simple
objects
quickly
bought
and
resembling
each
other
not
like
hats
or
dresses
which
might
lead
later
on
to
explanations
and
she
needed
boots
she
really
would
buy
them
it
would
she
felt
help
her
to
be
natural
if
what
she
said
so
far
as
it
went
were
true
but
so
greatly
was
she
chagrined
in
her
soul
that
she
should
have
to
talk
of
boots
at
all
instead
of
telling
him
her
robert
her
after
all
robert
with
delight
of
italy
and
of
her
discoveries
in
beautiful
new
feelings
that
when
she
had
gulped
and
cleared
her
throat
and
gulped
again
and
opened
her
mouth
she
found
herself
not
talking
of
boots
nor
yet
of
berlin
but
addressing
him
with
something
of
the
indignant
irrelevance
of
a
suffragette
who
because
she
has
been
forcibly
fed
demands
the
vote
he
had
as
his
custom
was
brought
literature
with
him
and
was
sitting
bent
over
his
cup
with
the
book
propped
against
the
jug
it
was
called
der
and
was
apparently
as
all
the
books
he
brought
to
meals
also
were
apparently
absorbing
the
sound
of
the
dripping
of
the
rain
on
the
ivy
was
unbroken
at
first
except
by
the
sound
of
herr
dremmel
drinking
his
tea
and
the
room
was
so
gloomy
under
the
pall
of
heavy
sky
that
almost
one
needed
a
lamp
you
see
said
ingeborg
most
of
the
blood
in
her
body
surging
up
into
her
face
as
she
suddenly
after
ten
minutes
silent
struggle
leaned
across
the
table
and
plunged
into
the
inevitable
my
feeling
so
uncomfortable
about
a
simple
thing
like
this
is
really
the
measure
of
the
subjection
of
women
herr
dremmel
raised
his
head
but
not
his
eyes
from
his
book
expressing
thereby
both
a
civilised
attentiveness
to
anything
she
might
wish
to
say
and
a
continued
interest
in
the
sentence
he
was
at
when
he
had
finished
it
he
looked
at
her
over
his
spectacles
and
inquired
if
she
had
spoken
why
should
i
not
go
and
come
unquestioned
she
asked
flushed
with
indignation
that
his
prejudices
should
be
forcing
her
to
the
low
cunning
that
substituted
boots
for
italy
do
he
examined
her
impartially
what
do
i
do
ingeborg
he
asked
with
patience
go
away
when
you
want
to
and
come
back
when
you
choose
you
been
quite
far
you
went
once
to
a
place
the
other
side
of
berlin
oh
i
know
it
business
you
go
on
but
i
do
think
that
makes
it
any
better
on
the
contrary
it
is
half
as
good
a
reason
as
going
because
beautiful
to
go
and
fine
and
splendid
and
it
is
as
though
i
even
had
to
ask
you
to
give
me
money
for
it
i
simply
roll
in
that
hundred
a
year
you
allow
me
i
have
spent
a
quarter
of
it
for
years
my
cupboard
upstairs
is
stuffed
with
notes
he
looked
at
her
but
finding
it
impossible
to
discover
any
meaning
in
her
remarks
began
to
read
again
robert
with
patience
he
again
removed
his
eyes
from
his
book
and
looked
at
her
beneath
the
table
she
was
pressing
her
hands
together
twisting
them
about
in
her
lap
well
ingeborg
he
said
do
you
think
it
unworthy
the
way
women
have
to
ask
permission
to
do
things
no
said
herr
dremmel
but
he
was
thinking
of
the
and
it
was
mere
chance
that
he
did
not
say
yes
when
husbands
go
away
they
do
ask
their
wives
permission
and
it
never
would
occur
to
the
wives
that
they
ought
to
so
why
should
the
wives
have
to
ask
the
husbands
herr
dremmel
gazed
at
her
a
moment
and
then
made
a
stately
excluding
but
entirely
kindly
movement
with
his
right
hand
ingeborg
he
said
i
am
not
interested
and
he
began
to
read
again
she
poured
herself
out
some
more
tea
drank
it
hastily
and
hot
and
said
with
a
great
effort
it
nonsense
about
permissions
i
i
going
to
berlin
then
she
waited
with
her
heart
in
her
mouth
and
both
hands
clutching
the
edge
of
the
table
but
nothing
happened
he
read
on
robert
she
said
once
more
he
endeavoured
to
place
his
attention
at
her
disposal
dragging
it
away
reluctantly
from
his
book
yes
ingeborg
he
said
robert
i
going
to
berlin
are
you
ingeborg
he
inquired
with
perfect
mildness
why
i
got
to
get
things
shop
and
why
berlin
ingeborg
is
not
meuk
nearer
boots
she
said
there
are
any
in
meuk
i
never
any
in
meuk
and
in
königsberg
that
also
is
nearer
than
berlin
you
must
have
heard
she
said
laying
hold
because
she
was
afraid
of
the
first
words
that
came
into
her
head
of
berlin
wool
well
the
same
thing
exactly
applies
to
boots
he
stared
at
her
as
one
who
feels
about
for
some
point
of
contact
with
an
alien
intelligence
naturally
if
you
have
to
go
you
must
he
said
yes
for
ten
days
ten
ingeborg
on
account
of
boots
she
nodded
defiantly
her
hands
beneath
the
table
twisted
into
knots
he
adjusted
his
mind
to
the
conception
ten
days
for
boots
ten
ten
she
said
recklessly
prepared
to
brave
any
amount
of
opposition
i
want
to
see
a
few
things
while
i
about
it
the
galleries
for
instance
it
is
going
to
be
boots
i
stirred
from
here
since
our
marriage
except
to
go
to
zoppot
it
time
i
went
it
really
time
i
went
but
said
herr
dremmel
with
the
complete
reasonableness
of
one
who
is
indifferent
and
has
no
desire
whatever
to
argue
but
naturally
of
course
ingeborg
then
you
do
mind
but
why
should
i
mind
you
you
not
even
surprised
but
why
should
i
be
surprised
and
once
again
he
reflected
on
her
apparently
permanent
obtuseness
to
values
she
gazed
at
him
with
the
astonishment
of
a
child
who
has
screwed
itself
up
for
a
beating
and
finds
itself
instead
being
blessed
she
felt
relief
but
a
pained
relief
an
aggrieved
almost
angry
relief
such
as
he
feels
who
putting
his
entire
strength
into
the
effort
to
lift
a
vessel
he
fears
is
too
heavy
for
him
finds
it
light
and
empty
her
soul
as
it
were
tumbled
over
backwards
and
sprawled
how
funny
she
murmured
how
very
funny
and
here
i
been
afraid
to
tell
you
but
once
more
he
had
ceased
to
listen
his
eye
had
been
caught
by
a
statement
on
the
page
in
front
of
him
that
interested
him
acutely
and
he
read
with
avidity
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
then
he
got
up
with
the
book
in
his
hand
and
went
to
the
door
thinking
over
what
he
had
read
she
sat
looking
after
him
i
expect
i
think
i
suppose
i
shall
start
she
said
as
he
opened
the
door
start
he
repeated
absently
why
should
you
start
oh
robert
i
ca
get
there
if
i
do
start
get
where
ingeborg
he
asked
his
eyes
on
hers
but
his
thoughts
in
unimaginable
distances
oh
robert
but
to
berlin
of
course
berlin
yes
very
well
berlin
and
deeply
turning
over
the
new
and
pregnant
possibilities
suggested
to
him
by
what
he
had
just
been
reading
he
went
out
chapter
xxxii
as
though
to
assure
her
of
what
she
already
knew
that
she
was
on
the
threshold
of
the
most
glorious
ten
days
of
her
life
the
world
when
she
looked
out
of
the
window
next
morning
was
radiant
with
sunshine
and
sparkling
with
freshness
far
away
on
the
edge
of
russia
the
great
rain
clouds
that
had
come
up
to
kökensee
from
the
west
and
folded
it
for
two
days
in
a
stupor
of
mist
were
disappearing
in
one
long
purple
line
the
garden
glistened
and
laughed
sweet
fragrances
from
the
responsive
earth
hurried
to
meet
the
sun
like
eager
kisses
if
she
had
needed
reassuring
this
happy
morning
warm
and
scented
would
have
done
it
but
now
that
the
night
was
over
a
time
when
those
who
are
going
to
have
doubts
do
have
them
and
the
dark
sodden
days
when
if
facts
are
going
to
be
blurred
they
are
blurred
she
felt
no
scruples
nor
any
misgivings
she
had
simply
got
to
the
beginning
of
the
most
wonderful
holiday
of
her
life
everything
was
easy
robert
went
away
after
an
early
breakfast
to
his
fields
to
see
the
improvement
hours
soaking
must
have
made
and
obviously
did
not
mind
her
impending
departure
in
the
least
one
of
the
horses
till
lately
lame
was
recovered
karl
told
her
and
able
to
take
her
in
to
meuk
the
servant
klara
seemed
proud
to
be
left
in
sole
charge
the
train
left
meuk
so
conveniently
that
she
would
have
time
to
visit
robertlet
and
ditti
on
the
way
singing
she
packed
her
smallest
trunk
singing
she
thrust
money
from
the
cupboard
where
it
had
so
long
lain
useless
into
her
blouse
one
two
three
ten
blue
german
notes
of
a
hundred
marks
each
while
she
wondered
but
not
much
if
it
would
be
enough
and
wondered
but
equally
not
much
if
it
would
be
too
little
singing
she
pinned
on
unfamiliar
objects
such
as
a
hat
and
veil
and
sought
out
gloves
singing
she
handed
over
the
keys
to
klara
singing
she
stood
on
the
steps
watching
karl
harness
the
horses
all
the
birds
of
kökensee
were
singing
too
and
the
pig
sunning
itself
in
a
thick
ecstasy
of
appreciation
also
sang
according
to
its
lights
and
it
was
not
its
fault
she
thought
excusingly
if
what
happened
when
it
sang
was
that
it
grunted
life
is
really
the
heavenliest
thing
she
said
to
herself
buttoning
her
gloves
her
face
sober
with
excess
of
joy
the
it
has
round
its
corners
the
dear
surprises
of
happiness
and
when
the
buttons
came
off
she
did
mind
but
excused
them
too
on
the
ground
that
they
were
not
used
to
being
buttoned
and
let
her
gloves
happily
dangle
she
would
have
excused
everything
that
day
she
would
have
forgiven
everybody
every
sin
klara
brought
her
out
a
packet
of
sandwiches
with
her
luggage
and
a
little
bunch
of
flowers
how
kind
every
one
is
she
thought
smiling
at
klara
wondering
if
she
would
mind
very
much
if
she
kissed
her
her
heart
one
single
thank
you
that
reached
right
round
the
world
and
then
suddenly
just
as
karl
was
ready
and
the
carriage
was
actually
at
the
door
and
the
little
trunk
being
put
into
it
and
her
umbrella
and
sandwiches
and
flowers
she
ran
back
into
the
house
and
scribbled
a
note
to
robert
and
put
it
on
the
table
in
his
laboratory
where
he
would
not
be
able
to
avoid
seeing
it
when
he
came
in
that
afternoon
i
not
tell
him
was
the
thought
that
had
winged
her
impulse
i
not
tell
the
truth
this
heavenly
day
of
joy
was
true
about
the
she
wrote
inking
her
gloves
too
frantically
hurried
to
take
them
off
going
to
italy
with
ingram
to
venice
it
his
picture
and
of
course
other
things
too
on
the
way
if
you
think
it
over
you
wo
really
mind
i
must
run
or
miss
the
train
ingeborg
and
she
climbed
up
into
the
carriage
and
drove
off
greatly
relieved
and
strong
in
her
faith
if
you
gave
him
time
and
quiet
in
understanding
of
a
thing
so
transparently
reasonable
she
would
write
again
she
said
to
herself
a
real
letter
from
berlin
and
put
her
points
of
view
and
ingram
before
him
of
course
that
was
the
right
thing
to
do
of
course
a
highly
intelligent
man
like
robert
was
bound
ultimately
to
understand
but
her
train
did
not
get
to
berlin
till
eleven
that
night
and
when
she
reached
the
she
found
a
letter
from
ingram
telling
her
she
must
be
at
the
anhalter
station
next
morning
at
nine
and
though
she
meant
to
get
up
early
and
write
she
spent
the
time
being
very
tired
asleep
instead
and
it
was
only
when
the
strains
of
a
harmonium
penetrated
into
her
room
and
wandered
round
her
head
making
slow
lutheran
noises
that
she
woke
up
and
realised
how
nearly
she
was
on
the
verge
of
missing
the
train
to
italy
breakfastless
and
prayerless
and
almost
without
paying
her
bill
she
hurried
forth
from
the
her
clothes
full
of
an
odd
smell
of
naphthalin
and
the
meals
that
had
been
eaten
there
before
she
arrived
the
ancient
meals
of
all
the
yesterdays
from
the
smell
she
concluded
cautiously
and
reluctantly
sniffing
while
she
put
down
both
windows
of
her
cab
that
what
they
had
to
eat
in
the
was
the
chorales
of
the
harmonium
expressed
in
cabbage
and
whether
it
was
the
cab
or
whether
it
was
her
clothes
she
did
not
know
but
there
inside
it
with
her
still
was
cabbage
it
the
odour
of
piety
she
explained
hastily
to
ingram
when
he
on
meeting
her
at
the
station
looked
at
her
with
what
she
thought
a
severe
inquiry
it
that
you
within
an
ace
of
missing
the
train
he
said
catching
hold
of
her
elbow
and
hurrying
her
down
the
platform
to
a
door
that
still
stood
open
with
an
angry
official
glaring
dreadfully
in
spite
of
his
tip
waiting
beside
it
to
shut
it
i
so
sorry
she
said
panting
a
little
as
she
dropped
into
a
corner
of
the
carriage
opposite
him
and
the
train
slipped
away
from
the
station
but
i
could
get
here
any
sooner
why
could
you
he
asked
still
severely
for
he
had
spent
a
distressing
and
turbulent
half
hour
you
only
had
to
get
up
in
time
but
i
could
get
up
because
i
was
asleep
nonsense
ingeborg
you
could
tell
them
to
call
you
well
but
i
did
tell
them
and
why
do
you
button
your
gloves
here
i
button
them
you
ca
there
are
any
buttons
what
no
buttons
they
came
off
but
why
in
heaven
name
did
you
sew
them
on
again
do
buttons
matter
i
was
in
such
a
tremendous
hurry
to
start
and
she
smiled
at
him
a
smile
of
perfect
happiness
to
come
to
me
to
come
to
me
he
said
his
eyes
on
hers
yes
and
italy
italy
well
you
very
nearly
missed
me
what
would
you
have
done
then
oh
gone
to
italy
what
just
the
same
well
italy
italy
is
it
look
at
this
sky
is
it
wonderful
is
it
perfectly
glorious
can
the
sky
in
italy
possibly
be
bluer
than
this
he
made
an
impatient
movement
he
said
and
added
catching
sight
of
her
why
is
your
glove
all
over
ink
because
i
wrote
to
robert
in
it
what
you

truth

sort
of
way
and
you

that

and
i
said
and
he
find
the
letter
when
he
comes
in
yes
he
ca
help
seeing
it
i
put
it
on
his
laboratory
table
right
in
the
middle
ingram
leaned
forward
his
face
flushed
laughter
and
triumph
in
his
eyes
and
caught
hold
of
her
right
hand
in
its
inky
glove
adorable
inkstains
he
said
looking
at
them
and
then
looking
up
at
her
you
little
burner
of
ships
and
as
she
opened
her
mouth
in
what
was
evidently
going
to
be
a
question
he
hurried
her
away
from
it
with
a
string
of
his
phrases
you
are
all
the
happiness
he
said
with
an
energy
of
conviction
astonishing
at
nine
in
the
morning
and
all
the
music
and
all
the
colour
and
all
the
fragrance
there
is
in
the
world
then
you
have
noticed
the
cabbage
she
asked
immensely
relieved
he
let
go
her
hand
what
cabbage
he
asked
shortly
for
it
nettled
him
to
be
interrupted
when
he
was
spinning
images
and
it
more
than
nettled
him
to
be
interrupted
in
the
middle
of
an
emotion
but
when
she
began
vividly
to
describe
the
inner
condition
of
the
he
stopped
her
i
do
want
to
talk
of
anything
ugly
he
said
not
of
all
days
in
my
life
and
he
added
leaning
forward
again
and
looking
into
her
eyes
ingeborg
do
you
know
what
is
thursday
said
ingeborg
the
conductor
it
was
a
corridor
train
and
though
they
had
the
compartment
to
themselves
the
passage
outside
was
busy
with
people
squeezing
past
each
other
and
begging
each
other
pardons
came
in
to
look
at
their
tickets
there
is
a
restaurant
car
on
the
train
he
said
in
german
giving
information
with
prussian
care
a
disciplinary
care
for
the
comfort
of
his
passengers
who
were
to
be
made
comfortable
to
be
forced
to
use
the
means
of
grace
provided
or
the
authorities
would
know
the
reason
why
yes
said
ingram
you
do
not
change
said
the
conductor
with
prussian
determination
that
his
passengers
should
not
even
if
they
wanted
to
and
liked
it
go
astray
no
said
ingram
not
until
basel
said
the
conductor
menacingly
almost
as
if
he
wanted
to
pick
a
quarrel
no
said
ingram
at
basel
you
change
said
the
conductor
eyeing
him
ready
to
leap
on
opposition
yes
said
ingram
you
will
arrive
at
basel
at
said
the
conductor
in
tones
behind
which
hung
do
you
hear
you
just
got
to
yes
said
ingram
at
basel
oh
go
to
said
ingram
suddenly
violently
and
in
his
own
tongue
the
conductor
immediately
put
his
heels
together
and
saluted
from
the
extreme
want
of
control
of
the
gentleman
manner
he
knew
him
at
once
for
an
officer
of
high
rank
disguised
for
travelling
purposes
in
civilian
garments
and
silently
and
deferentially
withdrew
if
there
a
restaurant
car
can
i
have
some
breakfast
asked
ingeborg
have
you
had
any
you
poor
little
thing
come
along
she
followed
him
out
into
the
corridor
he
going
first
to
clear
people
out
of
the
way
and
turning
to
give
her
his
hand
at
the
crossings
from
one
coach
to
the
next
the
restaurant
was
in
the
front
of
the
train
and
it
required
perseverance
and
the
opening
of
many
difficult
doors
to
get
to
it
each
time
he
turned
to
help
her
and
gripped
hold
of
her
hand
as
they
swayed
against
the
sides
and
were
bumped
they
looked
at
each
other
and
laughed
what
fun
it
all
was
she
thought
and
how
entirely
new
and
delicious
being
taken
care
of
as
though
she
were
a
thing
that
mattered
a
precious
thing
he
had
had
breakfast
in
berlin
but
he
sat
watching
her
with
an
alert
interest
that
missed
not
the
smallest
of
her
movements
very
reminiscent
in
his
attitude
and
pleasure
of
a
cat
watching
its
own
dear
mouse
observing
it
with
a
whiskered
relish
its
own
dear
particular
mouse
that
it
has
ached
for
for
years
before
it
ever
met
it
filling
itself
dismally
meanwhile
with
the
wrong
mice
who
disagreed
with
it
its
mouse
that
annexed
and
safely
incorporated
was
going
to
do
it
so
much
good
and
make
it
twice
the
eat
it
was
before
and
he
buttered
her
roll
for
her
and
poured
out
her
tea
and
did
all
the
things
a
cat
would
do
in
such
a
situation
if
it
were
a
man
pleased
that
its
mouse
should
fatten
aware
that
anything
it
ate
and
drank
would
ultimately
so
to
speak
remain
in
the
family
the
splendid
june
morning
the
last
morning
of
june
shone
golden
through
the
long
continuous
windows
of
the
car
the
fields
of
the
mark
lay
bathed
in
light
it
was
early
still
but
it
had
already
begun
to
be
hot
and
haymakers
straightening
themselves
to
watch
the
train
go
by
wiped
their
faces
and
the
prudent
cows
were
gathered
in
the
shade
of
trees
and
in
the
ear
the
ventilator
twirled
and
hummed
and
the
waiter
in
his
white
linen
jacket
who
brought
her
strawberries
each
one
of
which
had
been
examined
and
passed
as
fit
and
sound
by
the
proper
authorities
suitably
housed
in
berlin
in
buildings
erected
for
the
purpose
was
a
credit
to
the
prussian
state
railway
which
decrees
briefly
and
implacably
that
waiters
shall
be
cool
she
pulled
out
one
of
the
blue
german
hundred
mark
notes
from
her
blouse
when
he
brought
the
bill
and
more
of
them
came
out
with
it
what
on
earth
is
all
that
for
ingram
asked
to
pay
with
and
you
must
tell
me
how
much
my
ticket
was
to
was
it
locarno
you
said
we
got
out
at
you
ca
go
about
with
money
loose
like
that
give
it
to
me
i
take
care
of
it
for
you
she
gave
it
to
him
nine
blue
notes
out
of
her
blouse
and
the
change
of
the
tenth
out
of
a
little
bag
she
had
brought
and
was
finding
great
difficulty
so
much
unused
was
she
to
little
bags
in
remembering
i
hope
it
enough
she
said
do
forget
i
got
to
get
back
again
he
laughed
tucking
the
notes
away
into
his
enough
it
a
fortune
you
can
go
to
the
end
of
the
world
with
this
he
said
is
it
all
glorious
is
it
all
too
wonderful
to
be
true
she
said
her
face
radiant
yes
and
the
most
glorious
part
of
it
is
that
you
ca
go
anywhere
now
he
said
putting
the
in
his
breast
pocket
and
patting
it
and
looking
at
her
and
laughing
without
me
but
i
do
want
to
i
much
go
with
you
it
so
extraordinarily
sweet
that
you
want
me
to
you
know
i
never
can
quite
believe
it
he
bent
across
the
table
little
glory
of
my
heart
he
murmured
the
waiter
came
back
with
the
change
i
wish
robert
were
here
said
ingeborg
gazing
round
her
out
of
the
windows
with
immense
contentment
if
only
he
could
have
got
away
i
believe
he
have
loved
it
ingram
pushed
back
his
chair
with
a
jerk
i
do
think
he
have
loved
it
at
all
he
said
and
going
back
through
the
length
of
the
train
to
their
compartment
though
he
helped
her
at
the
difficult
places
it
was
by
putting
out
his
hand
behind
him
for
her
to
clutch
he
did
not
this
time
turn
round
and
look
into
her
eyes
and
laugh
it
grew
very
hot
as
the
day
wore
on
and
extremely
dusty
the
thunderstorm
that
had
deluged
east
prussia
had
not
come
that
way
and
there
had
been
no
rain
from
the
look
of
things
for
a
long
while
the
dust
came
in
in
clouds
and
they
were
obliged
to
shut
the
windows
but
it
still
came
in
through
chinks
and
settled
all
over
them
and
choked
them
and
even
lay
in
the
delicate
details
of
ingeborg
nose
he
had
made
her
take
off
her
hat
and
veil
so
she
had
nothing
to
protect
her
and
he
watched
her
with
a
singular
annoyance
turning
gradually
he
wanted
to
lean
forward
and
dust
her
he
hated
to
see
her
whiteness
being
soiled
it
fidgeted
him
intolerably
he
himself
stood
long
train
journeys
badly
but
though
it
was
so
hot
so
insufferably
hot
she
was
as
active
and
restless
as
a
child
continually
jumping
up
and
running
out
into
the
dreadful
blazing
corridor
to
see
what
there
was
to
see
that
side
they
passed
weimar
and
she
was
of
an
intemperate
zeal
on
the
subject
of
goethe
putting
down
the
window
and
craning
out
to
look
and
quoting
du
das
land
wo
die
citrone
quoting
to
him
who
loathed
quotations
even
in
cool
weather
they
passed
eisenach
and
again
she
displayed
zeal
talking
eagerly
of
luther
and
the
wartburg
and
the
inkpot
and
the
devil
and
of
elizabeth
of
course
he
knew
she
would
get
to
elizabeth
she
told
him
the
legends
told
him
who
knew
all
legends
told
him
who
had
a
headache
and
could
only
keep
alive
by
going
into
the
lavatory
and
plunging
his
head
every
few
minutes
into
cold
water
and
she
did
not
in
the
least
mind
when
she
craned
out
of
the
window
to
look
at
things
that
she
should
come
back
into
the
carriage
again
with
her
hair
in
every
sort
of
direction
and
her
face
not
only
dusty
but
with
smuts
at
the
hottest
moment
of
the
day
he
felt
for
a
lurid
instant
as
if
it
were
not
one
he
was
with
but
the
entire
choir
having
its
summer
treat
and
being
taken
by
him
for
a
long
to
the
crystal
palace
but
that
was
after
luncheon
in
the
restaurant
car
a
luncheon
that
seemed
to
his
fevered
imagination
to
consist
of
bits
of
live
cinder
served
in
sulphur
and
eaten
in
a
heaving
swaying
lake
of
brimstone
even
the
waiter
who
attended
to
their
table
was
in
the
teeth
of
regulations
a
melted
man
and
when
the
inspector
passed
through
looking
about
him
with
the
eye
of
a
prussian
eagle
to
see
that
all
was
in
order
and
the
standard
set
by
law
was
being
reached
of
cool
waiters
and
hot
food
and
tepid
passengers
he
instantly
pounced
on
the
manifestly
melted
waiter
who
unable
to
deny
the
obvious
fact
that
he
was
beaded
put
his
heels
together
and
endeavoured
to
escape
a
fine
by
anxious
explanation
that
he
knew
he
was
in
a
perspiration
but
that
it
was
a
cold
one
they
were
having
tea
when
they
passed
frankfurt
and
dinner
when
they
passed
heidelberg
a
great
full
moon
was
rising
behind
the
castle
at
heidelberg
and
the
neckar
was
a
streak
of
light
the
summer
day
was
coming
to
an
end
in
perfect
calm
the
quiet
roads
leading
away
into
woods
and
through
orchards
were
starred
on
either
side
with
white
flowers
in
the
dusk
it
was
only
the
white
flowers
that
still
shone
the
stitchworts
the
clusters
of
star
of
bethlehem
the
spikes
of
white
helleborine
and
all
the
colours
of
the
day
the
blue
of
the
chickory
and
delicate
lilac
of
dwarf
mallows
the
bright
yellow
of
wood
loosestrife
and
of
campions
were
already
put
out
for
the
night
ingeborg
gazed
through
the
window
with
the
face
of
a
happy
goblin
her
eyes
looked
brighter
than
ever
out
of
their
surrounding
smuts
and
her
hair
was
all
ends
little
upright
ends
that
stirred
in
the
draught
the
dreadful
day
the
hours
and
hours
of
heat
and
choking
airlessness
had
made
no
impression
on
her
apparently
except
to
turn
her
from
clean
to
dirty
while
ingram
lay
back
in
his
corner
a
thing
hardly
human
wanting
nothing
now
in
the
world
but
cold
water
poured
over
him
and
he
to
lie
while
it
was
poured
on
a
slab
of
iced
marble
but
the
sun
was
down
at
last
dew
was
falling
and
quieting
the
dust
and
the
final
journey
to
the
restaurant
car
had
been
made
a
journey
on
which
it
was
ingeborg
who
opened
the
doors
and
nobody
helped
anybody
at
the
crossings
he
had
walked
behind
her
and
had
fretfully
observed
her
dress
and
how
odd
it
was
like
old
back
numbers
of
illustrated
papers
the
sleeves
wrong
the
skirt
wrong
too
much
of
it
in
places
too
little
in
others
but
mostly
there
was
too
much
for
it
was
the
year
when
women
were
skimpy
you
have
to
get
some
clothes
in
italy
he
said
to
her
at
dinner
what
for
she
asked
surprised
what
for
to
put
on
he
said
with
a
limp
acerbity
but
now
at
last
between
strassburg
and
bâle
when
all
glare
had
finally
departed
and
the
lamp
in
their
compartment
was
muffled
into
grateful
gloom
by
the
shade
he
drew
across
it
and
the
windows
were
wide
open
to
the
great
dusky
starry
night
and
a
thousand
dewy
scents
were
stirred
in
the
fields
as
the
train
passed
through
them
he
began
to
feel
better
at
his
suggestion
she
had
gone
out
and
washed
her
face
so
that
he
could
look
at
it
again
delicately
fair
in
the
dusk
with
satisfaction
and
presently
because
of
some
curves
the
rails
took
the
moon
shone
in
on
her
while
he
still
sat
in
shadow
and
her
face
turned
upwards
to
the
stars
with
the
wonder
on
it
of
her
happiness
once
more
seemed
to
him
the
most
spiritual
thing
he
had
yet
found
in
a
woman
unconscious
spirit
exquisitely
independent
and
aloof
he
watched
her
out
of
the
shadow
of
his
corner
for
a
long
time
taking
in
every
curve
and
line
trying
to
fix
her
look
of
serenity
and
clear
content
on
his
memory
the
expression
of
an
inner
tranquillity
of
happy
giving
oneself
up
to
the
moment
that
he
had
not
seen
before
except
in
children
to
watch
her
like
that
soothed
him
gradually
quite
out
of
the
fever
and
fret
of
the
day
as
his
habit
was
he
forgot
his
other
mood
as
if
he
had
never
had
it
growing
cool
and
comfortable
with
the
growing
coolness
of
the
night
his
irritations
and
impatiences
and
desire
it
had
for
several
hours
in
the
afternoon
been
paramount
with
him
for
personal
absence
from
her
were
things
wiped
out
of
recollection
he
forgot
in
the
quiet
of
her
attitude
that
she
had
ever
been
restless
and
in
her
expressive
and
beautiful
silence
that
she
had
ever
quoted
and
watching
her
whiteness
that
she
had
ever
been
drab
she
was
he
thought
considering
her
his
head
very
comfortable
now
on
the
cushions
and
a
most
blessed
draught
deliciously
lifting
his
hair
like
the
soft
breast
of
a
white
bird
she
was
like
diamonds
only
that
she
was
kind
and
gentle
she
was
like
spring
water
on
a
thirsty
day
she
was
like
a
very
clear
delicate
white
wine
yes
but
what
was
it
she
was
most
like
he
searched
about
for
it
in
his
mind
his
eyes
on
her
face
and
presently
he
found
it
and
leaned
forward
out
of
the
shadow
to
tell
her
ingeborg
he
said
and
at
the
moment
he
entirely
meant
it
you
are
like
the
peace
of
god
chapter
xxxiii
at
bâle
there
was
hurry
and
bustle
the
half
hour
they
ought
to
have
had
there
wasted
away
by
some
unaccountable
loosening
of
the
bandages
of
discipline
on
the
german
side
to
four
minutes
the
conductor
when
questioned
said
the
engine
had
gone
wrong
and
explained
with
a
shrug
that
was
to
help
hide
his
shame
in
this
failure
of
the
infallible
that
engines
were
but
human
and
again
there
was
an
undignified
scamper
down
steps
and
up
steps
and
along
platforms
and
they
arrived
panting
pushed
in
by
porters
only
just
in
time
into
a
compartment
studded
round
with
sleeping
swiss
ingram
left
ingeborg
sitting
temporarily
on
the
edge
of
the
seat
clasping
her
umbrella
and
coat
and
little
bag
while
he
walked
through
the
train
in
search
of
more
space
refusing
to
believe
such
a
repulsive
thing
could
happen
to
him
as
that
he
should
be
obliged
to
travel
to
bellinzona
with
four
sleeping
swiss
but
the
train
seemed
to
be
a
popular
one
else
a
national
festival
was
preparing
or
some
other
upheaval
that
caused
people
to
move
about
that
night
in
numbers
and
all
the
compartments
were
full
he
went
back
to
ingeborg
in
a
condition
of
resentful
gloom
the
four
swiss
were
sleeping
in
the
four
corners
and
the
carriage
smelt
of
crumbs
he
opened
the
window
and
there
was
an
immediate
simultaneous
resurrection
of
the
four
swiss
into
angry
life
ingram
fluent
in
french
met
them
with
an
equal
volubility
standing
with
his
back
to
the
open
window
protecting
it
from
their
assaults
while
ingeborg
looked
on
in
alarm
but
the
conductor
when
he
came
pronounced
in
favour
of
the
four
swiss
pacified
they
instantly
fell
asleep
again
and
ingram
at
least
not
taking
care
of
their
legs
strode
out
into
the
corridor
where
he
stood
staring
through
the
open
window
at
midnight
nature
and
cursing
himself
for
not
having
broken
the
journey
at
bâle
while
ingeborg
peeped
anxiously
at
his
back
round
her
coat
and
her
umbrella
from
bâle
to
lucerne
he
was
as
unaware
of
her
as
if
he
had
never
met
her
so
very
angry
was
he
and
so
very
tired
then
at
lucerne
two
of
the
swiss
got
out
and
turning
round
he
saw
her
asleep
in
the
compartment
tumbled
over
a
little
to
one
side
still
holding
her
things
and
once
again
she
filled
his
heart
she
was
utterly
asleep
in
the
most
uncomfortable
position
dropped
away
in
the
middle
of
how
she
happened
to
be
sitting
like
a
child
does
or
a
puppy
and
he
went
in
and
sat
down
beside
her
and
lifted
her
head
very
cautiously
and
gently
on
to
his
arm
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
up
at
him
along
his
sleeve
without
moving
in
a
sort
of
surprise
this
is
lucerne
he
whispered
bending
down
how
soft
she
was
and
how
little
is
it
why
that
where
robert
and
i
but
she
was
asleep
again
she
slept
till
he
woke
her
up
before
bellinzona
and
so
she
never
knew
the
moment
she
had
thrilled
to
think
of
when
they
would
in
the
dawn
of
the
summer
morning
come
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
gothard
into
what
in
spite
of
anything
the
swiss
might
say
was
italy
and
still
half
asleep
mechanically
putting
on
her
hat
and
pausing
to
rub
her
eyes
while
he
urged
her
to
be
quick
she
did
not
realise
where
she
was
when
she
did
and
looked
eagerly
at
the
window
it
was
to
turn
to
him
immediately
in
consternation
she
said
yes
said
ingram
passing
his
hand
quickly
over
his
hair
a
gesture
of
his
when
annoyed
it
was
raining
they
got
out
on
to
what
seemed
the
most
melancholy
platform
in
the
world
a
grey
wet
junction
with
a
grey
level
sky
low
down
over
it
and
over
all
the
country
round
it
the
locarno
train
was
waiting
and
they
went
to
it
in
silence
it
was
a
quarter
to
six
a
difficult
time
of
day
the
train
almost
empty
jogged
slowly
through
the
valley
of
the
ticino
down
the
windows
raindrops
chased
each
other
on
the
road
alongside
the
railway
a
road
bound
also
for
locarno
and
dreary
with
brown
puddles
an
occasional
high
cart
crawled
drawn
by
a
mule
and
driven
by
a
huddled
human
being
beneath
a
vast
umbrella
the
lake
when
they
came
in
sight
of
it
was
a
yawn
of
mist
ingeborg
stared
out
at
these
things
in
silence
it
was
incredible
that
this
should
be
italy
again
in
spite
of
anything
the
swiss
might
say
while
on
the
other
side
of
the
alps
all
germany
including
kökensee
lay
shimmering
in
light
and
colour
ingram
sat
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
carriage
his
hands
thrust
in
his
pockets
his
hat
pulled
over
his
eyes
looking
straight
in
front
of
him
he
was
a
mass
of
varied
and
profound
exasperations
everything
exasperated
him
even
to
the
long
trickle
slowly
creeping
towards
him
down
the
floor
from
ingeborg
wet
umbrella
there
was
nothing
she
could
have
said
or
done
at
that
moment
that
would
not
have
rubbed
his
exasperation
into
a
flame
of
swift
and
devastating
speech
luckily
she
said
and
did
nothing
but
sat
quite
silent
with
her
face
turned
away
towards
the
blurred
window
panes
but
if
she
did
not
speak
or
do
she
yet
was
and
he
was
acutely
conscious
though
he
never
took
his
eyes
off
the
cushions
opposite
of
every
detail
of
her
in
that
grey
and
horrible
light
of
her
crumpled
clothes
her
drooping
smudgedness
her
hat
grown
careless
and
her
hair
in
wisps
he
had
wanted
to
show
her
italy
he
had
extraordinarily
wanted
to
show
her
italy
in
its
summer
magnificence
and
there
was
this
as
a
result
what
he
now
extraordinarily
wanted
was
to
upbraid
her
he
did
not
stop
to
analyse
why
at
the
hôtel
in
locarno
where
they
went
for
baths
and
breakfast
he
had
planned
originally
to
show
her
the
beautiful
walk
from
there
along
the
side
of
the
lake
to
cannobio
but
now
beyond
baths
and
breakfast
he
had
no
plan
a
person
in
shirt
sleeves
and
a
green
apron
who
inadequately
represented
the
for
it
was
not
yet
seven
and
the
was
still
in
bed
unintelligently
and
unfortunately
spoke
to
ingeborg
of
ingram
in
his
hearing
as
votre
this
strangely
annoyed
ingram
it
your
short
skirt
he
said
with
suppressed
sulphur
you
positively
must
get
some
clothes
dressed
like
that
you
suggest
perambulators
but
this
is
my
dress
she
protested
it
quite
new
i
mean
i
never
had
it
on
before
since
it
was
made
and
with
the
easy
tactlessness
of
one
who
has
not
yet
learned
to
be
afraid
she
looked
at
him
and
laughed
why
she
said
this
morning
i
perambulators
and
only
last
night
quite
late
last
night
i
was
the
peace
of
god
to
this
however
he
did
not
trust
himself
to
reply
but
vanished
with
a
kind
of
pounce
into
his
bathroom
he
came
to
breakfast
clean
but
in
a
mood
that
could
bear
nothing
least
of
all
good
temper
ingeborg
was
by
nature
good
tempered
she
sat
there
pleased
and
refreshed
after
all
he
remembered
resentfully
she
had
had
five
hours
sleep
in
the
train
while
he
had
not
had
a
wink
gaily
making
the
best
of
things
she
pointed
out
the
strength
of
the
coffee
and
the
crispness
of
the
rolls
she
asked
him
if
he
did
not
think
it
a
nice
hôtel
she
did
not
agree
when
he
alluded
to
the
waiter
as
blighted
she
predicted
a
break
in
the
weather
at
eleven
and
said
that
it
had
always
come
true
what
her
old
nurse
used
to
tell
her
that
rain
at
seven
meant
fine
at
eleven
he
hated
her
old
nurse
until
he
had
had
some
sleep
a
long
steady
sleep
he
would
he
knew
be
nothing
but
jarred
nerves
when
then
after
breakfast
she
inquired
with
a
cheerful
air
of
being
ready
for
anything
what
they
were
going
to
do
next
he
briefly
announced
that
he
was
going
to
sleep
oh
shall
i
have
to
go
too
she
asked
her
face
falling
of
course
not
then
she
said
eagerly
i
go
out
and
explore
what
in
this
rain
oh
i
got
goloshes
goloshes
he
retreated
into
his
room
it
annoyed
him
intensely
that
she
should
be
not
only
ready
but
pleased
to
go
out
for
her
first
walk
in
italy
without
him
he
threw
himself
angrily
on
the
bed
rang
the
bell
and
bade
the
person
who
answered
it
the
same
young
man
in
shirt
sleeves
and
a
green
apron
who
had
welcomed
them
tell
madame
that
if
he
were
not
awake
by
luncheon
time
she
was
not
to
wait
for
him
but
was
to
have
luncheon
at
the
proper
hour
just
the
same
the
young
man
sought
out
ingeborg
in
her
room
she
was
tugging
on
her
goloshes
one
foot
on
a
chair
her
face
flushed
with
effort
and
expectancy
votre
he
began
pas
mon
said
ingeborg
turning
an
amused
face
to
him
as
she
tugged
votre
certainement
said
ingeborg
who
in
spite
of
her
prize
for
french
was
unacquainted
with
the
refinements
of
that
language
pas
mon
she
said
energetically
repudiating
monsieur
pas
le
mari
de
said
the
young
man
trippingly
said
ingeborg
mari
est
à
la
said
the
young
man
mon
said
ingeborg
tiens
said
the
young
man
and
he
delivered
his
message
with
a
sudden
ease
and
comfort
of
manner
but
though
the
young
man
manner
grew
easy
after
his
report
of
this
brief
dialogue
the
hôtel
manner
grew
stiff
for
on
the
slip
of
paper
presented
to
ingram
to
be
filled
in
with
his
name
he
had
unaware
of
the
things
ingeborg
was
saying
described
himself
and
her
as
and
dobson
and
the
hôtel
in
which
english
church
services
were
held
and
which
was
at
that
moment
though
the
season
was
over
being
stayed
in
by
several
representative
english
spinsters
and
a
clergyman
also
from
england
with
a
wife
and
daughters
most
respectable
nice
ladies
who
all
took
him
out
every
day
twice
once
after
breakfast
and
once
after
tea
for
a
little
walk
the
hôtel
decided
putting
its
heads
together
in
the
manager
office
that
it
would
using
tact
encourage
the
dobsons
to
depart
it
could
do
nothing
however
for
the
moment
for
the
lady
had
disappeared
with
an
umbrella
into
the
wet
and
the
gentleman
it
could
hear
was
sleeping
and
this
condition
of
things
continued
for
many
hours
the
lady
not
coming
into
luncheon
but
remaining
in
the
wet
and
the
gentleman
it
could
hear
going
on
sleeping
then
it
became
aware
that
they
were
both
having
tea
in
a
distant
corner
of
the
slippery
windowed
wilderness
of
bamboo
chairs
and
tables
described
in
its
prospectus
as
the
handsome
palmy
lounge
and
that
they
had
drawn
up
a
second
table
to
the
one
their
tea
was
on
and
piled
it
with
undesirably
dripping
branches
of
the
yellow
broom
that
grew
high
up
in
the
hills
and
that
they
were
being
noticed
with
suspicion
by
the
hôtel
authentic
guests
who
were
used
to
having
their
tea
in
the
silent
stupor
of
the
really
married
because
the
gentleman
contrary
to
the
observed
habits
of
genuine
husbands
was
talking
to
the
lady
instead
of
reading
the
the
hôtel
was
nothing
if
not
competent
it
could
handle
any
sort
of
situation
competently
from
runaway
couples
to
that
most
unpleasant
form
of
guest
of
all
the
kind
that
came
alive
and
went
away
dead
full
of
tact
it
allowed
the
lady
and
gentleman
to
finish
their
tea
undisturbed
then
it
sent
some
one
sleek
to
inform
them
that
most
unfortunately
their
rooms
had
been
engaged
for
weeks
beforehand
for
that
very
night
and
therefore
but
before
this
person
could
even
begin
to
be
competent
the
gentleman
requested
him
to
have
a
carriage
round
in
half
an
hour
as
he
intended
going
on
that
evening
and
thus
the
parting
was
accomplished
as
all
partings
should
be
urbanely
and
the
manager
was
able
to
display
his
doorstep
suavity
and
bow
and
wish
them
a
pleasant
journey
the
dobsons
departed
in
a
gay
mood
with
the
branches
of
yellow
broom
rhythmically
nodding
between
them
over
the
edge
of
the
waterproof
apron
that
buttoned
them
in
ingram
had
slept
soundly
for
seven
hours
and
felt
altogether
renewed
he
was
taking
her
to
cannobio
along
the
road
he
had
hoped
to
walk
with
her
in
sunshine
but
ingeborg
who
had
climbed
hills
till
her
blood
raced
and
glowed
saw
peculiar
beauties
even
in
the
wetness
and
would
not
believe
that
sun
could
make
things
lovelier
outside
locarno
in
that
flat
and
grassy
place
beyond
the
town
where
the
beautiful
small
hills
draw
back
for
a
little
from
the
lake
and
the
daisies
grow
so
big
and
the
roads
are
strewn
white
with
the
blossoms
of
acacias
it
stopped
raining
and
ingram
had
the
hood
put
down
the
mountains
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
were
with
tufts
of
woolly
clouds
lying
along
them
down
near
the
water
the
lake
was
a
steely
black
the
valley
brooded
in
sullen
lushness
and
the
branches
of
broom
they
carried
with
them
in
the
carriage
cut
through
the
sombre
background
like
a
golden
knife
the
one
doubt
i
have
said
ingeborg
breathing
in
the
warm
scented
air
in
long
breaths
is
that
it
all
too
good
to
be
true
it
is
said
ingrain
safely
disentangled
for
a
while
from
the
intricate
effect
on
his
enthusiasms
of
fatigue
and
dirt
and
headaches
it
absolutely
good
and
absolutely
true
but
only
he
said
turning
and
looking
at
her
because
you
here
you
dear
close
sister
of
my
dreams
without
you
it
would
be
nothing
but
grey
empty
space
in
which
i
would
just
hang
horribly
you
would
you
could
not
be
happy
in
this
she
said
gazing
about
her
if
you
were
here
i
would
see
it
said
ingram
firmly
believing
it
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
nothing
ever
escaped
his
acute
vision
i
see
all
this
only
through
you
you
are
my
eyes
without
you
i
go
blind
i
grope
about
with
the
light
gone
out
you
do
know
what
you
are
to
me
you
little
shining
crystal
thing
you
do
begin
to
realise
it
my
dear
my
dear
sweet
and
this
morning
said
ingeborg
smiling
at
him
but
only
with
a
passing
smile
on
her
way
to
all
the
other
things
she
wanted
to
look
at
you
said
i
suggested
perambulators
for
a
space
they
drove
on
in
silence
for
he
deplored
her
trick
of
reminding
him
of
past
moods
but
beyond
ascona
where
the
mountains
come
down
to
the
lake
and
leave
only
just
room
enough
between
them
and
the
water
for
the
road
to
twist
through
he
recovered
again
consoled
by
her
joy
in
the
beauty
of
the
drive
and
unable
to
see
her
happiness
without
feeling
pleased
after
all
what
he
most
loved
in
her
was
that
she
was
so
miraculously
a
child
a
child
with
gleams
of
wisdom
flickering
like
a
lizard
tongue
in
her
mouth
and
who
even
when
she
was
silly
was
silly
also
somehow
in
gleams
gleams
of
silver
and
sunshine
and
always
at
the
back
of
her
far
away
hidden
in
what
he
thought
of
as
depths
of
burning
light
was
that
elusive
thing
by
which
he
was
so
passionately
attracted
the
thing
he
was
going
to
paint
the
thing
his
own
secret
self
crept
to
knowing
that
here
was
warmth
here
was
understanding
her
dear
dear
little
soul
the
evening
at
cannobio
was
unsatisfactory
ingeborg
manifestly
enjoyed
herself
but
it
was
with
an
absorption
in
what
she
was
seeing
and
an
obliviousness
to
himself
that
seemed
to
him
both
excessive
and
tiresome
here
was
everything
to
make
two
people
so
happily
alone
whisper
warmth
dusk
the
broad
shadow
of
unruffled
water
lights
romantically
twinkling
in
corners
the
twanging
of
a
distant
guitar
laughter
and
singing
and
the
glint
of
red
wine
from
the
little
tables
along
the
front
of
the
restaurants
beneath
the
arcade
at
the
back
of
the
piazza
and
he
there
ingram
after
all
a
person
of
real
importance
edward
ingram
at
her
feet
only
asking
to
be
allowed
to
explain
to
her
in
every
variety
of
phrase
how
sweet
she
was
but
she
was
dead
to
her
opportunities
there
was
another
woman
in
europe
he
told
himself
angrily
who
would
not
have
whispered
they
wandered
out
of
their
hôtel
after
dinner
a
square
pink
italian
albergo
facing
the
lake
where
the
town
left
off
and
free
as
indeed
cannobio
altogether
was
from
transitory
english
with
their
awful
eyes
and
they
strolled
about
looking
at
things
he
did
not
look
much
for
he
knew
these
italian
sights
and
sounds
by
heart
and
at
that
moment
only
wanted
to
look
at
her
but
the
least
little
thing
caught
her
attention
away
from
him
absolutely
to
the
exclusion
of
anything
he
might
be
saying
positively
she
even
preferred
to
listen
to
the
throb
of
the
steamer
coming
nearer
from
the
other
end
of
the
lake
than
to
him
and
she
interrupted
him
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
that
intimately
concerned
herself
to
stand
still
in
the
piazza
and
ask
him
what
he
thought
of
the
smells
i
do
think
about
them
at
all
he
said
shortly
oh
but
there
are
such
a
lot
of
them
she
exclaimed
sorting
them
out
with
her
lifted
nose
there
the
smell
of
roses
and
the
smell
of
lake
and
the
smell
of
frying
and
there
more
roses
and
then
garlic
and
then
there
a
quite
dim
one
and
then
there
a
little
puff
of
something
else
i
do
know
what
sheer
italy
i
expect
never
smelt
so
many
smells
she
ended
with
a
gesture
of
astonishment
he
tried
to
get
her
away
from
them
he
led
her
to
a
bench
beneath
a
come
and
sit
by
me
and
i
will
tell
you
things
he
said
luring
her
look
there
the
moon
got
free
from
the
clouds
and
do
you
see
how
the
coloured
lights
of
the
steamer
that
coming
shine
right
down
a
ladder
of
light
into
the
water
and
what
do
you
think
of
the
feel
of
the
air
little
sister
is
it
soft
and
gentle
does
it
remind
you
of
all
kind
and
tender
things
but
much
the
most
wonderful
of
anything
are
these
smells
she
said
absorbed
in
them
there
are
at
least
twelve
different
ones
never
mind
them
i
want
to
talk
but
they
so
amusing
she
said
there
are
interesting
ones
and
exciting
ones
and
beautiful
ones
and
disquieting
ones
and
awful
ones
and
ones
and
they
all
chasing
each
other
up
and
down
and
round
and
round
us
he
lit
a
cigarette
there
he
said
that
will
blot
the
whole
lot
of
them
into
only
one
and
you
talk
to
me
reasonably
let
us
talk
while
we
can
my
dear
in
a
little
time
we
shall
be
dead
to
all
feeling
for
ever
and
ever
yes
we
shall
be
little
shreds
of
rottenness
she
said
placidly
god
who
wastes
a
sunset
every
night
he
said
getting
up
to
stamp
on
the
match
he
had
thrown
away
if
they
were
mine
she
interrupted
i
keep
them
all
in
a
gallery
or
a
portfolio
understands
i
suppose
he
went
on
sitting
down
again
why
such
dear
things
as
this
evening
here
this
time
of
being
alone
together
here
should
end
and
be
forgotten
as
long
as
i
live
she
said
with
earnestness
it
will
not
be
forgotten
all
my
other
memories
will
be
like
a
string
of
oh
just
beads
and
nuts
and
till
i
get
to
this
one
and
then
on
the
string
there
be
suddenly
a
shining
jewel
really
really
he
murmured
stopping
to
look
into
her
eyes
revived
by
this
speech
little
flame
in
my
heart
really
oh
said
ingeborg
dreamily
in
her
husky
soft
voice
but
the
wonderfullest
thing
the
wonderfullest
jewel
my
first
italian
town
cannobio
he
ceased
to
be
revived
he
smoked
in
silence
the
effect
on
her
of
italy
was
as
surprising
as
it
was
unexpected
at
kökensee
she
had
been
entirely
concentrated
on
him
eagerly
listening
only
to
him
drinking
in
only
what
he
said
worshipping
here
she
seemed
possessed
by
a
rage
for
any
sights
and
sounds
merely
because
they
were
new
there
had
been
moments
from
the
very
start
in
berlin
when
he
almost
felt
of
secondary
interest
and
they
appeared
to
be
becoming
permanent
it
was
disturbing
it
was
incredible
it
was
grotesque
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
to
take
her
away
from
the
lakes
from
all
that
part
of
the
country
which
apparently
caught
her
imagination
on
its
most
sensitive
side
perhaps
milan
for
a
while
with
pavements
and
museums
please
will
you
give
me
some
of
that
money
she
asked
across
his
reflections
which
money
he
said
looking
at
her
my
money
what
on
earth
for
i
want
to
send
robert
a
picture
postcard
he
threw
his
cigarette
away
it
would
be
most
improper
he
said
passing
his
hand
rapidly
over
his
hair
highly
improper
improper
she
echoed
staring
at
him
to
send
robert
a
picture
postcard
grossly
it
simply
is
done
what
not
send
robert
but
he
like
to
see
where
we
got
to
for
heaven
sake
do
about
robert
he
exclaimed
getting
up
quickly
the
idea
of
the
picture
postcard
profoundly
shocked
him
not
talk
about
him
she
repeated
staring
at
him
in
astonishment
but
he
my
husband
exactly
that
what
makes
him
so
improper
what
why
i
thought
husbands
were
just
the
very
things
that
never
could
be
improper
ingeborg
he
said
walking
angrily
up
and
down
in
front
of
her
are
you
or
are
you
not
being
taken
care
of
on
this
this
holiday
by
me
are
you
or
are
you
not
travelling
with
me
yes
i
know
but
i
do
see
why
i
should
send
rob
well
then
if
you
do
see
you
must
believe
you
just
got
to
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
certain
things
are
impossible
but
robert
good
heavens
do
of
robert
if
i
beg
you
not
to
if
i
tell
you
it
spoils
things
for
me
if
i
ask
you
as
a
favour
he
stopped
in
front
of
her
my
dear
my
little
mate
my
everything
that
central
and
alive
among
the
husks
of
course
i
wo
then
at
least
i
try
to
remember
not
to
she
said
looking
at
him
with
a
smile
that
had
effort
in
it
as
well
as
surprise
but
i
do
see
why
a
picture
postcard
the
steamer
they
had
seen
for
so
long
the
last
one
of
the
day
from
arona
to
locarno
was
nearing
the
pier
and
the
piazza
suddenly
swarmed
with
busy
groups
preparing
to
go
on
it
or
see
each
other
off
let
come
away
said
ingram
impatiently
let
come
he
repeated
with
a
stamp
of
his
foot
i
hate
this
crowd
she
got
up
and
walked
beside
him
towards
the
hôtel
her
eyes
on
the
ground
i
really
ca
see
why
i
should
send
robert
she
began
oh
damn
robert
he
exclaimed
violently
she
looked
at
him
damn
robert
she
echoed
immensely
surprised
but
do
you
robert
no
said
ingram
no
he
said
even
louder
not
here
not
now
now
do
he
added
in
extreme
irritation
as
he
saw
her
mouth
opening
ask
me
why
do
ask
me
to
explain
go
to
bed
ingeborg
it
time
all
children
under
ten
were
in
bed
and
get
up
early
please
because
going
to
start
the
first
thing
for
anyhow
for
somewhere

chapter
xxxiv
ingram
was
not
only
a
great
painter
he
was
practised
in
minor
accomplishments
and
among
them
was
the
art
of
running
away
he
had
done
it
several
times
and
had
attained
fluency
indeed
so
easy
had
practice
made
it
that
it
grew
to
be
hardly
running
so
much
as
walking
he
walked
away
at
last
quite
leisurely
from
an
uncommenting
wife
to
a
lady
whose
affection
for
him
was
invariably
already
so
great
that
there
was
nothing
left
for
it
to
do
but
to
decline
and
when
it
had
declined
assisted
and
encouraged
in
various
ways
by
him
the
chief
cooling
factor
being
his
expressed
impatience
to
get
to
his
painting
again
undisturbed
by
each
lady
found
it
cooling
to
be
called
a
he
avoided
the
part
that
is
sometimes
a
little
difficult
the
part
in
which
recriminations
are
apt
to
gather
like
clouds
about
a
sunset
the
part
that
lies
round
ends
by
skilful
treatment
by
a
gradual
surrounding
of
her
who
was
now
not
so
much
a
lover
as
a
patient
with
an
atmosphere
of
affection
for
her
home
she
came
by
imperceptible
degrees
to
thirst
for
her
home
she
came
to
thirst
and
such
was
his
skill
that
she
thirsted
healthily
for
her
husband
or
her
father
or
whoever
it
was
she
had
left
for
worries
catastrophes
disgrace
for
anything
so
long
as
it
was
so
obliging
as
not
to
be
love
if
poorer
in
other
ways
she
departed
at
least
richer
in
philosophy
without
a
trace
of
jealousy
of
what
he
might
do
next
not
minding
what
he
did
if
only
she
did
not
have
to
do
it
too
and
he
until
such
time
as
he
again
was
lured
from
paths
of
austerity
and
work
by
the
hope
that
he
had
found
the
one
predestined
mate
enjoyed
the
condition
in
which
he
was
altogether
happiest
the
freedom
of
spirit
that
disdains
love
but
how
different
from
those
comfortable
excursions
as
straightforward
and
as
uneventful
to
him
in
their
transitory
salubrious
warming
as
bread
and
milk
was
this
running
away
it
was
distressingly
different
almost
except
that
he
had
no
desire
to
laugh
ridiculously
different
the
first
step
the
process
of
the
actual
removal
from
kökensee
to
berlin
from
legality
to
illicitness
had
in
its
smoothness
been
positively
glib
and
he
had
supposed
that
once
alone
together
which
was
the
very
marrow
of
running
away
else
why
run
would
follow
with
a
similar
glibness
nothing
however
seemed
less
inclined
to
follow
the
only
things
that
did
follow
were
two
confused
exasperating
days
in
which
his
moods
varied
with
every
hour
almost
at
last
with
everything
she
said
the
capaciousness
of
her
beliefs
and
acceptances
amazed
him
they
were
as
capacious
as
her
enthusiasms
she
believed
so
firmly
what
he
had
told
her
over
there
away
in
kökensee
where
of
course
a
man
had
to
say
things
in
order
to
get
a
beginning
made
about
the
friendly
frequent
journeyings
of
other
people
she
had
so
heartily
accepted
his
assurance
that
it
was
absurd
and
disgraceful
in
its
suggestion
of
not
to
travel
frankly
anywhere
with
anybody
are
we
not
the
children
of
light
you
and
i
he
had
asked
her
the
things
a
man
says
he
thought
but
they
should
not
be
brought
up
against
him
in
this
manner
clad
in
an
invincible
armour
of
acceptance
and
shall
we
be
hindered
in
our
free
comings
and
goings
by
the
dingy
scruples
of
those
heavy
others
the
groping
and
afraid
children
of
darkness
that
plainly
the
idea
that
she
was
doing
anything
even
remotely
wrong
had
not
occurred
to
her
the
basis
of
her
holiday
was
this
belief
in
frank
companionship
she
had
no
difficulty
he
observed
himself
infinitely
fretted
by
this
constant
closeness
to
her
in
being
just
a
frank
companion
she
was
so
carelessly
secure
in
friendship
so
empty
of
any
thought
beside
that
she
could
and
did
say
things
to
him
which
said
by
any
other
woman
in
the
same
situation
would
have
instantly
led
to
lovemaking
but
ingram
who
was
fastidious
could
no
more
make
love
to
her
violently
begin
robustly
stand
no
nonsense
so
long
as
she
was
steeped
in
obliviousness
than
he
could
to
a
child
or
a
chair
there
must
be
some
response
some
consciousness
her
obtuseness
to
the
real
situation
was
so
terribly
healthy
minded
that
it
was
almost
a
disease
the
awful
candour
of
soul
of
bishops
daughters
and
pastors
wives
appalled
him
for
three
days
the
weather
continued
heavy
pressing
down
on
his
eyes
he
did
not
sleep
he
was
all
nerves
in
the
morning
a
time
he
had
not
yet
known
her
in
for
at
kökensee
they
were
together
only
in
the
afternoons
she
produced
the
effect
on
him
of
some
one
different
and
in
some
subtle
annoying
way
strange
was
it
because
she
flickered
more
in
the
mornings
he
could
not
describe
it
better
than
that
she
flickered
she
always
flickered
mentally
her
thoughts
just
giving
each
subject
a
little
lick
and
then
blowing
off
it
to
something
else
but
in
the
afternoons
and
evenings
the
flickering
was
often
beautiful
or
at
those
warmer
more
indulgent
hours
it
seemed
so
and
in
the
morning
it
was
not
a
man
in
the
morning
wants
somebody
pinned
down
for
a
companion
somebody
reasonable
and
fixed
nothing
but
a
rather
silent
reasonableness
and
if
enunciations
are
unavoidable
brief
ones
go
well
with
coffee
and
with
rolls
at
breakfast
he
found
he
could
hardly
speak
to
her
so
exceedingly
then
was
she
on
his
nerves
her
dreadful
healthy
restedness
when
he
had
been
tossing
all
night
her
fearful
readiness
for
the
new
day
when
he
had
not
even
begun
to
recover
from
the
old
one
her
regularity
of
enthusiasm
her
punctual
happiness
and
every
evening
he
was
in
love
with
her
he
was
exasperated
this
being
with
her
among
the
hills
and
lakes
of
italy
that
he
had
thought
of
as
going
to
be
the
sweetest
time
he
had
known
was
sheer
exasperation
for
even
in
the
evenings
when
he
was
in
love
with
her
the
condition
indeed
set
in
at
any
time
from
tea
onwards
and
could
on
occasion
be
induced
before
tea
if
she
happened
to
say
the
right
things
he
was
irritably
in
love
and
hardly
knew
whether
it
would
give
him
more
satisfaction
to
shake
her
or
to
kiss
her
and
annoying
and
perplexing
as
her
untroubled
conscience
was
it
was
yet
not
so
annoying
and
perplexing
as
her
wild
joy
in
italy
who
would
not
be
galled
by
the
discovery
that
he
has
become
a
background
who
would
have
supposed
that
she
who
in
kökensee
thought
him
so
wonderful
so
clearly
realised
who
he
was
who
walked
with
him
there
in
the
and
offered
him
every
sort
of
incense
that
sweet
words
could
invent
would
let
loose
in
italy
take
the
background
he
had
so
carefully
chosen
for
his
lovemaking
and
hug
it
to
her
heart
and
be
absorbed
in
it
and
adore
it
beyond
reason
and
that
he
himself
would
turn
into
the
background
incredible
as
it
seemed
into
just
the
background
of
his
own
background
when
he
took
her
up
into
the
hills
into
solitary
places
where
the
chestnut
woods
went
on
for
miles
and
no
one
ever
came
but
he
was
not
as
it
were
there
when
he
took
her
on
the
lake
in
a
and
they
hung
motionless
on
the
goodwill
of
the
wind
he
was
not
there
either
when
they
rested
after
a
hot
climb
deep
in
some
high
meadow
not
yet
reached
by
the
ascending
haymakers
and
through
the
stalks
of
its
flowers
its
delicate
bending
scabious
and
frail
could
see
little
bits
of
lake
far
below
and
the
white
villages
on
the
mountains
opposite
and
the
whole
world
was
only
asking
to
be
made
a
frame
of
for
love
where
he
inquired
of
himself
in
the
picture
that
was
in
her
mind
and
irradiating
her
eyes
was
he
he
had
not
imagined
so
far
behind
him
were
his
own
discoveries
of
the
new
that
any
one
could
be
so
greedily
absorbed
watching
her
while
she
watched
everything
except
him
he
decided
he
would
take
her
to
milan
he
would
try
something
ugly
milan
this
heavy
hot
weather
ought
to
give
her
back
to
him
if
anything
would
they
would
stay
in
a
street
where
there
were
tramcars
and
noises
and
they
would
frequent
museums
they
would
walk
much
on
pavements
and
have
their
food
in
english
while
the
cure
was
in
progress
she
might
be
getting
herself
some
decent
clothes
for
really
her
clothes
were
distressing
and
when
it
was
accomplished
and
she
was
thoroughly
bored
with
things
and
had
come
back
to
being
aware
of
him
he
would
carry
her
off
to
venice
and
begin
work
work
the
best
thing
in
life
the
one
thing
that
keeps
on
yet
is
never
monotonous
the
supreme
thing
always
new
and
joyful
but
he
was
afraid
of
venice
venice
was
too
beautiful
she
would
not
sit
quiet
there
while
he
painted
her
she
would
want
to
go
out
and
look
impossible
to
take
her
there
until
she
had
learned
to
blot
out
everything
in
the
world
with
his
image
alone
this
blotting
out
he
perceived
would
have
to
be
achieved
in
milan
and
quickly
he
was
starving
for
his
work
so
acute
was
his
hunger
to
begin
the
great
picture
that
right
underneath
all
his
other
emotions
and
wishes
and
moods
was
a
violent
impatience
at
being
kept
from
it
by
what
his
subconsciousness
alluded
to
with
resentful
incorrectness
as
a
parcel
of
women
it
was
the
evening
at
luino
that
he
definitely
decided
on
milan
they
had
walked
that
day
along
the
wooded
paths
that
lead
ultimately
across
to
ponte
tresa
and
she
had
once
again
on
returning
to
luino
and
seeing
a
revolving
column
of
picture
postcards
outside
a
shop
and
catching
sight
of
some
that
showed
the
place
of
rocks
and
falling
water
in
which
they
had
eaten
their
luncheon
wanted
to
send
one
to
robert
she
had
not
said
so
but
she
had
hovered
round
the
column
looking
hungry
picture
postcards
seemed
to
have
a
dreadful
fascination
for
her
and
as
for
ingram
the
mere
sight
of
them
at
this
point
of
their
journey
made
him
see
red
he
had
instantly
observed
her
hungry
hovering
and
had
flared
out
into
a
leaping
rebuke
in
which
there
was
more
of
the
angry
schoolmaster
than
the
lover
he
had
felt
it
himself
and
seen
quick
as
he
was
to
see
a
little
look
of
surprised
and
questioning
fear
for
a
moment
in
her
eyes
well
it
because
you
always
thinking
of
robert
he
flashed
at
her
in
an
attempt
that
caught
fire
on
the
way
to
apologise
not
she
said
hesitatingly
with
a
smile
that
for
the
first
time
was
propitiating
and
the
accidents
of
the
pavement
making
him
walk
for
a
few
yards
in
front
of
her
she
found
herself
looking
at
his
back
his
high
thin
shoulders
and
the
rims
of
his
ears
with
a
startled
feeling
of
entire
strangeness
a
dim
thought
rose
and
disappeared
again
somewhere
in
the
back
of
her
mind
a
whisper
of
a
thought
hardly
breathed
and
gone
again
to
robert
he
took
her
to
milan
next
day
that
loud
and
sweltering
city
was
by
its
hot
dulness
to
bore
her
into
awareness
of
him
to
toss
her
by
sheer
elimination
of
other
interests
to
his
breast
inexorably
he
kept
her
on
the
steamer
and
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
her
prayers
that
they
might
land
when
it
stopped
at
attractive
villages
on
its
journey
down
the
lake
she
thought
this
unreasonable
for
why
come
at
all
to
these
lovely
places
come
so
close
that
one
could
almost
touch
them
and
then
whisk
away
and
hardly
let
one
look
and
she
could
not
help
feeling
after
he
had
been
short
with
her
about
the
borromean
islands
at
one
of
which
unfortunately
the
steamer
touched
that
it
would
be
both
blessed
and
splendid
to
travel
round
here
alone
free
able
to
get
out
at
islands
if
one
wanted
to
yes
those
are
islands
he
said
when
first
they
loomed
on
her
enraptured
gaze
yes
one
can
land
on
them
but
we
not
going
to
yes
yes
beautiful
but
we
got
to
catch
the
train
she
began
to
turn
a
slightly
perplexed
attention
to
him
surely
he
was
different
from
what
he
was
at
kökensee
and
there
were
the
borromean
islands
slipping
away
the
beautiful
islands
there
they
were
being
passed
going
out
of
her
life
it
was
unlikely
she
would
ever
see
them
again
to
ingram
on
that
leaden
afternoon
the
lake
looked
like
a
coffin
and
the
islands
as
dull
and
shabby
as
three
nails
in
it
to
ingeborg
they
looked
like
three
little
miracles
of
god
just
as
he
who
for
the
first
time
goes
abroad
would
give
up
rome
if
he
might
stop
at
calais
so
did
ingeborg
hanker
after
detailed
exploration
of
new
places
she
was
inexorably
whisked
away
from
the
borromean
islands
were
beautiful
but
if
they
had
been
dull
she
still
would
have
hankered
after
them
beautiful
or
dull
they
were
different
from
kökensee
and
when
the
travelled
ingram
put
his
hopes
in
milan
he
did
not
realise
how
great
on
ingeborg
after
her
strictly
cloistered
kökensee
existence
was
the
effect
of
the
merely
different
the
platform
at
arona
the
flat
fields
the
train
presently
lumbered
across
the
factories
and
suburbs
of
milan
the
noisy
streets
throbbing
heavily
with
heat
that
grey
and
lowering
afternoon
the
shapes
of
things
of
dull
things
of
tramcars
and
cabs
and
washerwomen
the
shop
windows
the
behaviour
and
foreign
faces
of
dogs
the
behaviour
of
children
the
italian
eyes
all
turned
to
her
all
staring
at
her
they
fascinated
and
absorbed
her
like
the
development
of
a
vivid
dream
who
were
these
people
what
would
they
all
do
next
what
were
they
feeling
thinking
saying
where
were
they
going
what
had
they
had
for
breakfast
what
were
the
rooms
like
they
had
just
come
out
of
what
sorts
of
things
did
they
keep
in
their
cupboards
if
one
of
them
would
lend
me
a
cupboard
she
exclaimed
to
ingram
and
leave
me
alone
with
what
it
has
got
inside
it
i
believe
i
know
all
italy
by
the
time
i
done
with
it
everything
everything
the
desires
of
its
soul
and
its
body
and
what
it
works
at
and
plays
at
and
eats
and
what
it
hopes
is
going
to
happen
to
it
after
it
is
dead
and
he
had
been
supposing
from
her
silence
as
she
walked
beside
him
that
she
was
finding
milan
dull
hastily
he
led
her
away
from
the
streets
into
an
english
and
made
her
sit
with
her
back
to
the
window
and
gave
her
rusks
but
though
her
childhood
had
been
spent
among
these
objects
which
were
esteemed
at
the
palace
because
falling
just
short
at
the
last
moment
of
quite
sweetness
and
quite
niceness
they
discouraged
sinful
gorging
they
had
none
of
their
ancient
sobering
effect
on
her
there
in
milan
she
ate
them
and
ate
them
and
remained
as
brightly
detached
from
them
as
before
their
dryness
choked
out
none
of
her
lively
interest
their
reminiscent
flavour
did
not
quiet
her
not
even
when
combined
as
it
presently
was
with
the
sound
of
church
bells
floating
across
the
roofs
she
might
have
been
in
redchester
with
those
sunday
bells
ringing
and
all
the
rusks
sitting
opposite
to
her
at
the
table
in
the
deserted
shop
ingram
decided
he
would
give
her
no
meals
more
amusing
than
this
in
milan
so
long
as
she
kept
him
there
she
should
except
breakfast
have
all
her
meals
in
that
one
place
modest
meals
meals
damping
to
the
spirits
and
surely
in
the
long
run
lowering
the
most
inflaming
dish
provided
by
the
being
it
announced
it
on
its
wall
poached
eggs
he
kept
her
there
as
long
as
he
could
long
after
the
tea
was
cold
and
tried
so
deeply
upset
was
he
becoming
by
the
delays
her
curious
immaturity
was
causing
in
the
normal
development
of
running
away
actually
in
that
place
of
buns
to
make
love
to
her
but
how
difficult
it
was
he
too
had
eaten
rusks
he
wanted
to
tell
her
he
adored
her
and
it
reached
her
across
the
teapot
in
the
form
of
comments
on
the
uncertainties
of
her
behaviour
he
wanted
to
tell
her
her
body
was
as
delicate
as
flowers
and
delightful
as
dawn
and
it
came
out
a
criticism
of
the
quality
also
the
quantity
of
her
enthusiasms
he
endeavoured
to
sing
the
praise
of
the
inmost
core
of
her
the
inexpressible
illuminating
understanding
and
wholly
sweet
core
and
instead
he
found
himself
acidly
deprecating
her
clothes
ingeborg
sat
listening
with
half
an
ear
and
eyes
bright
with
longing
to
be
out
in
the
streets
again
she
was
fidgeting
to
get
away
from
the
shop
and
was
sorry
he
should
choose
just
that
moment
to
smoke
so
great
a
number
of
cigarettes
even
the
young
lady
who
guarded
the
cakes
appeared
to
think
the
visit
for
one
based
only
on
tea
and
rusks
had
lasted
long
enough
and
came
and
cleared
away
and
inquired
in
english
it
being
her
native
tongue
whether
she
could
not
now
get
them
anything
else
the
curious
admixture
in
you
said
ingram
starting
out
with
the
intention
of
comparing
her
to
light
in
the
darkness
and
immediately
getting
off
the
rails
the
curious
admixture
in
you
of
streaks
of
childishness
and
spasmodic
maturity
you
are
at
one
moment
so
entirely
impulsive
and
irresponsible
and
a
moment
before
you
were
quite
intelligent
and
reasonable
and
a
moment
afterwards
you
are
splendid
in
courage
and
recklessness
when
was
i
splendid
in
courage
and
recklessness
she
asked
bringing
more
attention
to
bear
on
him
when
you
left
your
home
to
come
to
me
the
start
off
was
splendid
who
could
dream
it
would
fizzle
out
into
well
into
this
but
has
it
fizzled
out
you
not
she
leaned
across
the
table
a
little
anxiously
you
not
scolding
me
on
the
contrary
i
trying
to
tell
you
all
you
are
to
me
oh
said
ingeborg
i
intend
somehow
to
isolate
my
consciousness
of
your
streaks
streaks
as
bees
wax
up
a
dead
invader
oh
a
dead
invader
i
do
you
see
believe
in
the
damning
effect
of
one
specific
outbreak
nor
of
one
or
two
you
not
you
not
scolding
me
she
asked
again
a
little
anxiously
on
the
contrary
i
believing
in
and
clinging
to
your
dear
innermost
oh
said
ingeborg
i
believe
these
streaks
and
patches
and
spots
your
superficial
self
has
may
be
good
in
their
ultimate
effect
may
save
us
by
interrupting
from
those
too
serene
spells
that
love
with
usage
and
carelessness
she
gazed
at
him
her
mouth
a
little
open
he
lit
yet
another
cigarette
but
it
rather
like
he
said
flinging
the
match
away
into
a
corner
whither
the
young
lady
followed
it
and
with
a
pursed
reproachfulness
trod
it
out
it
rather
like
finding
a
crock
of
gold
in
one
garden
and
only
being
able
to
peep
at
it
sometimes
and
having
to
go
away
and
work
very
hard
for
eleven
shillings
a
week
she
went
on
gazing
at
him
in
silence
and
not
even
for
eleven
shillings
said
ingram
reflecting
on
all
he
had
already
endured
work
very
hard
for
nothing
she
leant
across
the
table
again
i
never
to
be
tiresome
she
said
little
star
he
said
stoutly
it
always
involuntary
my
tiresomeness
she
said
addressing
him
earnestly
oh
but
it
so
involuntary
and
the
dull
surfaces
i
know
i
have
and
the
scaly
imperfections
he
knocked
the
ashes
off
his
cigarette
with
unnecessary
vigour
almost
as
though
they
were
bits
of
an
annoying
relative
body
i
warped
and
encrusted
and
blundering
went
on
ingeborg
who
was
always
thorough
when
it
came
to
adjectives
in
his
irritable
state
to
have
her
abjectly
cheapening
herself
vexed
him
as
much
as
everything
else
she
had
done
that
day
had
vexed
him
he
might
under
provocation
point
out
her
weaknesses
but
she
must
not
point
them
out
to
him
he
wanted
to
worship
her
and
she
persisted
in
preventing
him
distressing
to
have
a
god
who
refuses
to
sit
quiet
on
its
pedestal
who
insists
on
skipping
off
it
to
show
you
its
shortcomings
and
beg
your
pardon
how
could
he
make
love
to
her
if
she
talked
like
this
it
would
be
like
trying
to
make
love
to
a
is
it
because
it
is
sunday
he
said
that
you
are
impelled
to
acknowledge
and
confess
your
faults
you
make
me
feel
as
if
a
verger
had
passed
by
and
pushed
me
into
a
pew
well
but
i
warped
and
encrusted
and
blundering
she
persisted
you
are
not
he
said
irritably
have
i
told
you
you
are
my
star
and
my
miracle
yes
but
i
tell
you
he
said
determined
to
believe
it
that
you
are
the
very
bath
of
my
tired
spirit
how
kind
you
are
she
said
you
as
kind
to
me
as
if
you
were
my
brother
sometimes
i
think
you
are
rather
like
my
brother
i
never
a
brother
but
you
very
like
i
think
the
one
i
would
have
had
if
i
had
had
one
she
warmed
to
the
idea
i
feel
as
if
my
brother
she
said
preparing
to
launch
into
enthusiasm
but
he
interrupted
her
by
getting
up
it
seems
waste
he
said
reaching
for
his
hat
to
talk
about
your
brother
as
you
never
had
him
shall
we
go
she
jumped
up
at
once
with
the
air
of
one
released
he
himself
could
not
any
longer
endure
the
or
he
would
have
stayed
in
it
gloomily
he
went
out
with
her
into
the
streets
again
and
noted
that
if
anything
she
seemed
more
active
and
eager
than
before
thoroughly
indeed
rested
and
refreshed
gloomily
he
realised
during
the
next
hour
or
two
that
she
had
an
eye
for
buildings
and
that
they
were
always
the
wrong
ones
gloomily
he
discovered
an
odd
liking
in
her
for
anything
however
bad
that
was
wrought
in
iron
he
could
not
get
her
past
some
of
the
iron
gates
of
the
palaces
he
hated
bad
gates
without
experience
she
could
not
compare
and
did
not
select
and
her
interest
was
indiscriminating
as
a
child
he
took
pains
to
avoid
the
piazza
del
duomo
but
by
some
accident
of
a
twisting
street
and
a
momentary
inattentiveness
he
did
find
himself
at
last
after
much
walking
as
he
had
thought
away
from
it
all
of
a
sudden
facing
it
urging
her
on
by
her
elbow
he
hurried
her
nervously
across
it
hoping
she
would
not
see
the
cathedral
but
the
cathedral
being
difficult
not
to
see
she
did
see
it
and
remained
as
he
had
feared
she
would
rooted
ingeborg
he
exclaimed
if
you
tell
me
you
like
that
oh
let
me
look
let
me
look
she
cried
holding
his
sleeve
while
he
tried
to
get
her
away
it
so
funny
it
so
ingeborg
he
almost
begged
but
from
its
outside
to
its
inside
was
an
inevitable
step
and
that
she
should
gasp
on
first
getting
in
seemed
also
after
she
had
done
it
inevitable
ingram
found
himself
looking
at
windows
following
her
down
vaults
towed
by
beadles
he
rubbed
his
hand
violently
over
his
hair
but
this
is
intolerable
he
cried
aloud
to
himself
i
shall
go
mad
and
he
strode
after
her
and
caught
her
arm
just
as
she
was
disappearing
over
the
brim
of
the
crypt
ingeborg
he
said
his
eyes
blazing
at
her
in
a
bright
astonishment
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
i
shall
not
reach
that
i
not
going
to
get
ever
at
till
i
paint
you
she
turned
in
the
gloom
and
looked
up
at
him
oh
i
know
i
get
you
then
he
went
on
excitedly
while
the
interrupted
beadle
impatiently
rattled
his
keys
nothing
can
hide
you
away
from
me
then
i
do
paint
you
see
by
myself
she
stared
up
at
him
and
all
this
you
doing
all
this
waste
of
running
about
have
you
then
forgotten
the
picture
it
was
as
though
he
had
shaken
her
suddenly
awake
she
stared
at
him
in
a
shock
of
recollection
why
of
course
the
picture
why
incredible
but
she
had
forgotten
it
actually
forgotten
it
in
the
wild
excitement
of
travelling
actually
she
had
been
wanting
to
linger
at
each
new
place
she
who
had
only
ten
days
altogether
she
who
had
come
only
after
all
because
of
the
picture
the
great
picture
the
first
really
great
thing
that
had
touched
her
life
and
here
she
was
with
him
its
waiting
creator
dragging
him
about
who
held
future
beauty
in
his
cunning
guided
hand
among
all
the
mixed
stuff
left
as
a
burden
on
the
generations
by
the
past
curious
about
the
stuff
with
an
uneducated
stupid
curiosity
wasting
time
ridiculously
blocking
the
way
to
something
great
to
the
greatest
of
the
achievements
of
a
great
artist
she
was
sobered
she
was
overcome
by
the
vivid
recognition
of
her
cheap
enthusiasm
oh
she
said
staring
up
at
him
wide
awake
entirely
ashamed
how
you
been
with
me
and
as
he
still
held
her
by
the
arm
his
eyes
blazing
down
at
her
from
the
top
step
of
the
crypt
she
could
find
no
way
of
expressing
her
shame
and
contrition
except
by
bending
her
head
and
laying
her
cheek
on
his
hand
chapter
xxxv
they
stood
there
for
what
seemed
to
the
beadle
at
the
bottom
an
intolerable
time
the
lady
evidently
nobody
certificated
with
her
cheek
on
the
gentleman
hand
and
he
himself
as
honest
a
man
as
ever
wanted
to
get
his
tip
and
be
done
with
it
kept
waiting
with
nothing
to
do
but
curse
and
rattle
his
keys
and
though
it
was
summer
the
crypt
was
cold
and
so
would
his
feet
be
soon
and
what
could
the
world
be
coming
to
when
people
carried
their
caressings
even
into
crypts
becoming
maddened
by
these
delays
the
beadle
cursed
them
both
their
present
past
and
future
roundly
and
thoroughly
and
also
profanely
for
by
the
accident
of
his
calling
he
was
very
perfect
in
profanity
beneath
his
breath
i
so
sorry
so
sorry
ingeborg
was
murmuring
who
did
nothing
by
halves
neither
penitence
nor
humility
nor
gratitude
my
worshipped
child
whispered
ingram
immensely
moved
by
this
swift
change
in
her
and
changed
as
swiftly
himself
by
the
softness
of
her
cheek
against
his
hand
ought
we
to
go
to
venice
she
asked
still
standing
in
that
oddly
touching
attitude
of
apology
not
but
how
can
a
picture
get
painted
in
just
that
little
time
ah
but
you
know
i
good
at
pictures
but
i
ca
stay
a
minute
longer
than
thursday
i
have
to
be
back
on
saturday
at
the
very
latest
you
see
it
will
all
be
quite
easy
but
to
think
that
i
the
picture
she
said
looking
up
at
him
shocked
while
the
ancient
humility
in
which
the
bishop
had
so
carefully
trained
her
descended
on
her
once
more
only
this
time
like
a
garment
grown
voluminous
since
last
it
was
put
on
they
had
for
some
reason
been
talking
in
murmurs
and
the
embittered
beadle
losing
his
began
to
say
things
audibly
strong
in
the
knowledge
of
tourist
ignorance
when
it
came
to
real
language
in
italian
he
said
exactly
what
he
thought
and
what
he
thought
was
so
monstrous
so
inappropriate
to
beadles
and
to
the
atmosphere
of
a
crypt
besides
being
so
extremely
and
personally
rude
that
it
roused
ingram
who
knew
italian
almost
better
than
the
beadle
for
his
included
scholarly
in
vituperation
strange
and
curious
twists
beyond
the
reach
of
the
uneducated
to
pour
a
sudden
great
burning
blast
of
contumely
down
on
to
his
head
and
having
done
this
he
turned
and
holding
ingeborg
hand
led
her
up
the
steps
again
leaving
the
beadle
at
the
bottom
solitary
shrivelled
and
singed
they
thought
no
more
of
crypts
and
beadles
they
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
ingram
held
her
by
the
hand
all
the
way
down
the
cathedral
and
the
piazza
when
they
came
out
on
to
it
with
its
crowds
of
vociferating
men
and
tramcars
and
sellers
of
souvenirs
seemed
to
ingeborg
nothing
now
but
a
noisy
irrelevance
whole
strips
of
postcards
were
thrust
unnoticed
into
her
face
the
purpose
of
her
journey
was
the
picture
marvellous
that
she
should
have
lost
sight
of
it
and
of
the
wonder
and
pride
of
being
needed
for
it
needed
at
last
for
anything
she
who
so
profoundly
had
longed
to
be
needed
but
needed
for
this
as
a
collaborator
actually
even
though
passive
and
humble
in
the
creation
of
something
splendid
he
put
her
into
a
cab
and
drove
with
her
away
from
the
fuss
and
din
she
was
exquisite
again
to
him
adorable
altogether
the
memory
of
the
fret
and
hot
irritation
of
the
day
was
wiped
out
as
though
it
had
never
been
by
that
other
memory
of
her
sweet
apology
on
the
steps
of
the
crypt
he
told
the
driver
for
it
was
towards
evening
to
take
them
to
those
gardens
described
by
the
as
probably
the
finest
public
park
in
italy
and
presently
as
they
walked
together
in
the
remoter
parts
the
dusk
dropped
down
like
a
curtain
between
them
and
the
sunday
night
crowd
collecting
round
the
fountains
tall
trees
and
clumps
of
box
and
shut
out
everything
except
mystery
and
she
in
that
quiet
place
of
trickling
water
and
dim
flowers
began
again
to
talk
to
him
as
she
had
talked
at
kökensee
softly
deliciously
about
nothing
except
himself
it
was
like
the
shadow
of
a
great
rock
in
a
thirsty
land
it
was
infinite
refreshment
and
relief
she
talked
about
the
picture
with
reverence
adoringly
she
told
him
how
in
the
rush
of
new
impressions
she
had
been
forgetting
everything
that
really
mattered
not
only
that
greatest
of
them
all
but
the
other
things
she
had
to
thank
him
for
besides
italy
her
unexpected
holiday
due
so
entirely
to
him
she
said
her
husky
voice
softer
than
ever
with
gratitude
you
have
been
giving
me
happiness
and
happiness
heaped
happiness
on
me
with
both
your
hands
she
said
searching
only
for
words
that
should
be
sweet
enough
do
you
know
i
could
cry
to
think
of
it
all
of
all
you
been
to
me
since
you
came
to
kökensee
when
back
there
again
this
time
with
you
will
be
like
a
hidden
precious
stone
and
when
i
stupid
and
thinking
that
life
is
dull
i
get
it
out
and
look
at
it
and
it
will
flash
colour
and
light
at
me
when
you
talk
like
that
said
ingram
greatly
stirred
it
is
as
though
a
little
soul
had
come
back
into
a
deserted
and
forgotten
body
is
it
she
murmured
so
glad
that
she
could
please
him
perfectly
melted
into
the
one
desire
to
make
up
when
you
talk
like
that
he
said
life
becomes
a
thing
so
happy
that
it
shines
golden
inside
you
have
the
soul
i
have
always
sought
the
thing
that
comes
through
me
like
light
through
a
window
so
that
i
am
lit
so
that
my
heart
is
all
sweet
fire
and
you
said
ingeborg
picking
up
his
image
as
she
so
often
irritatingly
did
only
now
it
did
not
irritate
him
and
flinging
it
back
with
a
fresh
adornment
the
thought
of
you
the
memory
of
you
when
gone
back
to
my
everyday
life
will
be
like
a
perfect
in
a
grey
wall
as
though
we
could
be
separated
again
as
though
being
in
love
with
somebody
miles
away
is
just
intolerable
ache
oh
my
dear
why
do
you
look
at
me
he
asked
with
a
large
simplicity
of
manner
that
made
her
ashamed
of
her
surprise
because
i
talk
of
being
in
love
why
two
people
simply
love
each
other
and
say
so
and
if
i
love
you
it
with
the
greedy
possessive
love
i
had
for
women
before
but
as
though
the
feeling
one
has
for
the
light
on
crystals
or
for
clear
shining
after
rain
the
feeling
of
beauty
in
deep
and
delicate
things
has
become
personified
and
exalted
she
made
a
little
deprecating
gesture
he
was
almost
too
kind
to
her
too
kind
but
nobody
could
reasonably
object
to
being
loved
like
crystals
and
clearness
after
rain
robert
could
possibly
mind
that
she
cast
about
for
things
to
say
back
shining
things
to
match
his
but
he
found
them
all
first
it
was
impossible
to
keep
up
with
him
you
are
delicate
and
fine
like
translucent
gold
he
said
and
you
are
brave
and
various
and
alive
and
you
are
full
of
sweet
little
fancies
little
swirls
of
mood
kind
eager
things
never
in
my
life
is
there
the
remotest
chance
that
i
shall
meet
so
good
and
deep
a
happiness
as
you
again
and
i
put
my
heart
once
and
for
all
between
your
dear
cool
little
hands
she
felt
bent
beneath
this
generosity
she
who
had
been
so
tiresome
and
not
only
tiresome
but
she
who
had
had
doubts
unworthy
ones
she
now
saw
round
about
breakfast
time
for
instance
piercing
through
her
silly
delight
in
italy
as
to
whether
she
were
giving
even
any
satisfaction
i
perceive
he
went
on
i
never
really
loved
before
i
played
with
dolls
and
expressed
myself
to
dummies
like
a
boy
with
a
ball
he
play
with
and
failing
a
playfellow
he
bumps
it
against
a
wall
and
catches
it
again
but
you
play
back
my
living
dear
heart
more
and
more
was
she
invaded
by
a
happy
surprise
the
she
had
been
doing
without
knowing
it
all
the
right
ones
apparently
the
whole
time
playing
back
coming
up
to
his
expectations
and
moments
such
as
those
at
the
borromean
islands
and
when
there
were
picture
postcards
and
just
recently
in
the
had
not
in
the
least
been
what
she
supposed
she
had
not
understood
she
glowed
to
think
she
had
not
understood
i
been
so
wearied
and
distressed
with
life
he
went
on
talking
in
a
low
moved
voice
it
has
seemed
at
last
such
an
old
hairy
thing
of
jealousies
and
shame
and
disillusionments
and
work
falling
short
of
its
best
and
endless
coming
and
going
of
people
and
me
for
ever
left
with
a
blunted
edge
and
now
you
come
you
and
are
like
a
great
sweet
wind
blowing
across
it
and
like
clear
skies
and
a
moon
rising
before
sunset
it
is
as
though
you
had
taken
up
a
brush
and
painted
out
the
old
ugly
tangles
and
made
a
new
picture
of
me
in
luminous
clear
watercolour
her
surprise
grew
and
grew
and
her
gladness
that
she
had
been
mistaken
those
streaks
she
thought
he
did
really
what
he
said
about
those
streaks
somehow
though
quite
intelligent
all
along
continued
ingram
been
shallow
and
hard
in
my
feelings
about
everything
now
i
feel
love
like
a
deep
soft
river
flowing
through
my
heart
i
love
every
one
because
i
love
you
i
can
set
out
to
make
people
happy
i
can
do
and
say
fine
and
generous
things
because
of
the
love
of
you
shining
in
my
heart
that
beadle
she
thought
he
did
really
what
he
said
to
that
beadle
you
what
i
been
looking
for
in
women
all
my
life
he
went
on
you
the
dream
come
true
i
only
tried
to
love
before
and
now
you
come
and
made
me
love
which
we
all
dream
of
doing
and
given
me
love
which
we
all
dream
of
getting
her
pleasure
became
tinged
with
a
faint
uneasiness
for
she
have
thought
left
to
herself
that
she
had
been
giving
him
love
pastors
wives
did
give
love
except
to
their
pastors
friendship
yes
she
had
given
him
warm
friendship
and
an
abject
admiration
of
his
gifts
and
pride
and
gratefulness
oh
such
pride
and
gratefulness
that
he
should
like
being
with
her
and
saying
lovely
things
to
her
but
love
she
had
supposed
love
was
reserved
for
lovers
well
if
he
liked
to
call
it
love
one
must
not
be
it
was
very
kind
of
him
it
was
also
more
and
more
wonderful
to
her
that
she
had
been
doing
and
being
and
giving
all
these
things
without
knowing
it
her
suddenly
discovered
accomplishments
staggered
her
is
it
possible
she
thought
with
amazement
that
i
and
as
if
he
had
heard
the
word
lovers
in
her
mind
he
said
it
other
lovers
he
said
are
engaged
perpetually
in
sycophantic
adaptations
in
what
she
thought
he
had
been
going
to
say
engaged
to
be
married
for
though
she
had
known
even
at
redchester
in
spite
of
the
care
taken
to
shut
such
knowledge
out
that
the
world
included
wicked
persons
who
loved
without
engagements
or
marriages
sometimes
indeed
even
without
having
been
properly
introduced
persons
who
were
afterwards
punished
by
the
correctly
plighted
by
not
being
asked
to
tea
they
were
the
bishop
informed
an
anxious
inquirer
once
when
he
had
supposed
her
out
of
the
room
in
god
infinite
mercy
numerically
negligible
but
ingram
did
not
heed
her
except
us
he
went
on
us
she
echoed
well
if
one
took
the
word
in
its
widest
sense
we
fit
he
said
we
fit
and
reflect
each
other
i
in
your
heart
you
in
my
heart
like
two
mirrors
that
hang
opposite
one
another
for
ever
a
doubt
as
to
the
expediency
of
so
much
talk
of
hearts
and
love
crept
into
her
mind
but
she
quieted
it
by
remembering
how
much
worse
the
song
of
solomon
was
and
yet
so
respectable
really
she
said
continuing
her
thought
aloud
and
all
only
about
the
church
what
is
so
respectable
come
and
sit
on
that
seat
by
the
bush
covered
with
roses
he
said
look
in
this
faint
light
they
are
as
white
and
delicate
as
you
the
song
of
solomon
it
just
happened
to
come
into
my
head
things
do
she
added
beginning
to
lay
hold
of
the
first
words
that
occurred
to
her
no
longer
at
her
ease
she
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
seat
where
he
put
her
it
stone
she
said
nervously
looking
up
at
him
for
he
had
taken
a
step
back
and
was
considering
her
his
head
on
one
side
do
you
think
it
good
for
us
you
beautiful
little
thing
he
murmured
considering
her
you
exquisite
little
lover
her
hands
gripped
the
edge
of
the
seat
more
tightly
a
sudden
very
definite
longing
for
robert
seized
her
oh
but
she
began
and
faltered
she
tried
again
it
so
of
you
but
you
know
but
i
think
what
do
you
think
my
dear
my
discoverer
my
creator
my
restorer
oh
i
know
there
was
solomon
she
faltered
holding
on
to
the
seat
saying
things
too
and
they
meant
something
else
but
but
is
this
different
different
because
well
i
suppose
through
my
not
being
the
church
i
very
she
added
apologetically
that
i
not
the
church
because
then
i
suppose
nothing
would
really
matter
you
mean
you
do
want
me
to
call
you
lover
well
i
am
she
said
in
the
voice
of
one
who
apologised
for
drawing
his
attention
to
it
there
no
getting
away
from
that
but
we
have
got
away
from
it
said
ingram
sitting
down
beside
her
and
loosening
the
hand
nearest
him
from
its
tight
hold
on
the
seat
and
kissing
it
while
she
watched
him
in
an
uneasiness
and
dismay
that
now
were
extreme
that
exactly
what
we
have
done
oh
he
went
on
kissing
her
hand
with
what
seemed
to
her
a
quite
extraordinary
emotion
you
brave
beautiful
little
thing
you
must
know
you
ca
not
know
how
completely
and
gloriously
you
have
burned
your
ships
ships
she
echoed
she
stared
at
him
a
moment
then
added
with
a
catch
in
her
breath
which
ships
ingeborg
ingeborg
my
fastness
my
safety
my
darling
my
reality
my
courage
said
ingram
kissing
her
hand
between
each
word
yes
she
said
brushing
that
aside
but
which
ships
my
strength
my
helper
friend
sister
lover
unmerited
mate
yes
but
wo
you
leave
off
a
minute
it
it
would
be
if
you
leave
off
a
minute
and
tell
me
which
ships
he
did
leave
off
to
look
into
her
eyes
in
the
dusk
eyes
fixed
on
him
in
a
concentration
of
questioning
that
left
his
epithets
on
one
side
as
so
much
irrelevant
lumber
little
worshipful
thing
he
said
still
gripping
her
hand
did
you
really
think
you
could
go
back
did
you
really
think
you
could
go
back
where
to
that
unworthy
rubbish
heap
kökensee
she
stared
at
him
their
faces
close
together
were
white
in
the
dusk
and
their
eyes
looking
into
each
other
were
like
glowing
dark
patches
why
should
i
not
think
so
she
said
because
you
little
artist
in
recklessness
you
burned
your
ships
she
made
an
impatient
movement
and
he
tightened
his
hold
on
her
hand
please
she
said
do
you
mind
me
about
the

laughed
triumphantly
and
kissed
her
hand
again
but
that
would
have
helped
either

went
on
because

the
ten
days

if
you

would
and
could
the
whole
world
gives
you
to
me
you
my
mate
now
for
ever
she
watched
him
kissing
her
hand
as
though
it
did
not
belong
to
her
she
was
adjusting
a
new
thought
that
was
pushing
its
way
like
a
frozen
spear
into
her
mind
trying
to
let
it
in
seeing
she
could
not
keep
it
out
among
all
those
happy
thoughts
so
warmly
there
already
about
ingram
and
her
holiday
and
the
kindness
and
beauty
of
life
without
its
too
cruelly
killing
too
many
of
them
too
quickly
do
you
mean
she
began
then
she
stopped
because
what
was
the
use
of
asking
him
what
he
meant
quite
suddenly
she
knew
an
immense
slow
coldness
an
icy
fog
seemed
to
settle
down
on
her
and
blot
out
happiness
all
the
dear
accustomed
things
of
life
the
small
warm
things
of
quietness
and
security
the
everyday
things
one
nestled
up
to
and
knew
were
sliding
away
from
her
so
that
she
heard
herself
saying
in
a
funny
clear
voice
there
only
god
how
only
god
he
asked
looking
up
at
her
only
god
left
who
would
call
it
adultery
the
word
in
her
mouth
shocked
him
chapter
xxxvi
she
sat
quite
still
after
that
while
he
talked
after
that
one
deplorable
bald
word
she
said
no
more
at
all
and
ingram
passionate
explanations
and
asseverations
only
every
now
and
then
caught
her
ear
she
was
going
home
that
was
all
she
knew
and
could
think
of
back
to
robert
away
from
ingram
somehow
at
once
robert
would
turn
her
out
ingram
was
saying
so
she
heard
that
robert
might
kill
her
ingram
was
saying
so
she
heard
that
too
he
did
say
kill
he
called
it
but
whatever
it
was
who
cared
she
would
at
least
she
thought
with
a
new
grimness
be
killed
legitimately
she
was
going
back
to
robert
going
to
tell
him
she
was
sorry
anyhow
that
then
he
could
do
what
he
chose
but
how
to
get
to
him
oh
how
to
get
to
him
her
thoughts
whirled
ingram
would
let
her
go
but
she
was
going
ingram
had
her
money
but
she
was
going
that
very
night
her
thoughts
whirling
and
whizzing
went
breathless
here
in
dark
terrifying
places
and
while
she
was
flying
along
on
them
like
a
leaf
on
a
hurricane
blast
ingram
was
still
kissing
her
hand
still
pouring
out
phrases
as
he
had
been
doing
ever
since
surely
ever
since
time
began
she
stared
at
him
remembering
him
in
a
kind
of
wonder
she
caught
a
word
here
and
there
pellucid
he
was
saying
something
was
translucent
she
felt
no
resentment
she
had
deserved
all
she
had
got
not
ingram
and
what
he
had
told
her
or
not
told
her
mattered
but
robert
how
to
reach
robert
how
to
get
near
enough
to
him
to
say
see
i
come
back
draggled
and
muddied
everybody
believes
it
you
believe
it
though
i
tell
you
it
not
true
and
if
you
believe
it
or
not
it
your
ruin
you
have
to
leave
this
place
and
all
your
work
and
hopes
now
kill
me
a
man
she
heard
ingram
going
on
still
passionately
explaining
what
was
so
completely
plain
must
pretend
things
at
the
beginning
to
get
his
dear
woman
of
course
of
course
nodded
her
thoughts
in
hurried
agreement
rushing
past
him
to
the
swift
turning
over
of
ways
of
reaching
robert
who
cared
about
dear
women
how
to
hide
from
ingram
that
she
was
going
how
to
keep
him
from
suspecting
her
from
watching
her
every
instant
a
vision
of
herself
in
the
restaurant
car
handing
him
over
the
money
she
had
chaining
herself
of
her
own
accord
to
him
rose
for
a
moment
danced
mockingly
it
was
so
ludicrously
important
an
action
and
at
the
same
time
so
small
and
natural
before
her
eyes
the
chances
of
life
the
way
small
simplicities
worked
out
great
devastations
she
threw
back
her
head
in
a
brief
astonished
laugh
instantly
ingram
kissed
her
throat
i
i
she
gasped
getting
up
quickly
it
has
been
so
hot
all
day
she
said
with
a
little
look
of
apologising
remembering
to
gather
her
terror
and
misery
tightly
round
her
like
a
cloak
so
that
it
should
not
touch
him
so
that
he
should
not
by
so
much
as
a
flutter
of
it
feel
that
it
was
there
for
then
he
would
watch
her
and
she
she
gripped
her
hands
together
would
be
lost
lost
i
think
i
tired
she
said
he
became
immediately
all
reasonableness
the
kindly
reasonableness
of
one
who
has
cleared
away
much
confusion
and
can
now
afford
to
wait
he
got
up
too
agreeing
about
the
heat
of
the
day
and
reminding
her
also
of
its
length
of
the
journeys
by
land
and
water
it
had
contained
and
of
the
inadequate
meal
of
rusks
that
had
been
their
sole
support
for
nearly
six
hours
no
wonder
she
was
tired
he
was
tenderness
and
concern
itself
poor
little
thing
he
whispered
drawing
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
holding
it
there
clasped
in
his
other
hand
as
he
led
her
away
towards
the
entrance
and
went
with
her
out
into
the
streets
again
making
her
walk
slowly
lest
she
should
be
more
tired
restraining
her
when
she
tried
to
hurry
and
seeing
a
cheerful
restaurant
with
crowded
tables
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
it
he
suggested
they
should
stop
at
it
and
have
supper
but
ingeborg
said
in
a
low
voice
kept
carefully
controlled
that
she
was
afraid
she
would
go
to
sleep
over
supper
she
was
so
tired
might
she
have
some
milk
at
the
hôtel
and
go
to
bed
his
tenderness
for
her
as
he
conceded
the
milk
was
but
he
she
murmured
he
must
have
supper
would
he
not
send
her
back
in
a
cab
and
stay
here
and
have
some
no
he
would
certainly
not
trust
a
thing
so
precious
to
some
careless
cabman
he
would
take
her
back
to
the
hôtel
and
then
perhaps
have
food
but
the
hôtel
she
murmured
was
so
stuffy
did
he
think
he
would
like
food
there
well
perhaps
when
she
was
safely
in
it
he
would
come
out
again
to
one
of
these
pavement
places
she
seemed
more
pliantly
feminine
as
she
went
with
quiet
steps
through
the
streets
on
his
arm
than
he
had
yet
known
her
it
was
as
though
she
had
wonderfully
been
converted
from
boyhood
to
womanhood
smitten
suddenly
with
womanhood
there
in
those
gardens
and
every
muscle
of
her
mind
and
will
had
relaxed
into
a
sweet
fatigue
of
abandonment
he
adored
her
like
that
so
gentle
giving
no
trouble
accepting
the
situation
and
his
comfortings
and
his
pattings
of
the
hand
on
his
arm
and
all
his
further
explanations
and
asseverations
with
a
dear
reasonableness
he
had
not
yet
seen
in
her
in
return
he
took
infinite
care
of
her
protective
and
possessive
whenever
they
came
to
a
crowd
or
a
puddle
and
he
stroked
her
hand
and
looked
into
her
face
demanding
and
receiving
an
answering
obedient
smile
and
he
wanted
her
and
asked
her
to
lean
heavily
on
his
arm
so
that
she
should
not
be
so
tired
in
a
word
he
was
fond
they
were
staying
at
an
hôtel
near
the
station
just
off
the
station
square
down
a
side
street
a
place
frequented
by
italians
and
commercial
travellers
noisy
with
passing
tramcars
and
of
little
promise
in
the
matter
of
food
ingram
had
taken
rooms
there
that
afternoon
when
the
determination
was
strong
upon
him
that
ingeborg
in
milan
should
not
be
comfortable
now
he
was
sorry
for
the
happy
turn
things
had
taken
the
immense
stride
he
had
made
in
the
direction
of
venice
by
opening
her
eyes
to
the
facts
of
the
situation
made
this
excess
of
martyrdom
unnecessary
but
there
they
were
the
rooms
engaged
and
unpacked
in
on
the
first
floor
almost
on
a
level
with
the
ceaseless
passing
tops
of
the
bumping
tramcars
and
it
was
too
late
that
night
to
change
he
felt
however
very
apologetic
now
as
he
went
with
her
up
the
dingy
stairs
to
the
door
of
her
room
in
case
some
too
cheery
commercial
traveller
should
meet
her
on
the
way
and
dare
to
look
at
her
it
an
unworthy
place
for
my
little
shining
mate
he
said
but
venice
will
make
up
for
it
all
you
love
my
rooms
there
the
spaciousness
of
them
and
the
sunset
on
the
lagoons
from
the
windows
we
go
he
searched
her
face
as
she
stood
in
the
crude
top
light
of
the
corridor
naturally
she
was
tired
after
such
a
day
but
he
observed
a
further
dimness
about
her
a
kind
of
opaqueness
like
that
of
a
lamp
whose
light
has
been
put
out
and
it
afflicted
him
the
light
would
be
lit
again
he
knew
and
burn
more
brightly
than
ever
but
it
afflicted
him
that
even
for
a
moment
it
should
go
out
and
swiftly
glancing
up
and
down
the
passage
he
took
both
her
hands
in
his
and
kissed
them
little
dear
one
he
said
little
sister
you
do
forgive
me
oh
but
of
course
of
course
said
ingeborg
quickly
with
all
her
heart
and
she
felt
for
a
moment
the
acute
desolation
of
life
the
inevitable
hurtings
the
eternal
impossibility
whatever
steps
one
took
of
not
treading
to
death
something
that
too
was
living
and
beautiful
this
thing
or
that
thing
one
or
the
other
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
him
were
suddenly
veiled
with
tears
her
thoughts
stopped
swirling
round
ways
of
escape
and
very
vivid
was
the
perception
that
her
escape
if
she
did
succeed
in
it
was
going
to
be
from
something
she
would
never
find
again
from
a
light
and
a
warmth
however
fitful
and
a
greatness
if
he
had
been
her
brother
she
would
have
put
her
arms
round
him
and
kissed
him
if
she
had
been
his
mother
she
would
have
solemnly
blessed
him
as
it
was
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
the
bleak
banality
of
turning
away
into
her
room
and
shutting
the
door
she
heard
his
footsteps
going
down
the
passage
she
went
to
the
window
and
saw
him
going
down
the
street
there
was
not
an
instant
to
lose
she
must
find
out
a
train
now
while
he
was
away
have
that
at
least
ready
in
her
mind
for
the
moment
when
she
somehow
had
got
the
money
first
that
then
think
out
how
to
get
the
money
she
stole
into
the
passage
again
stole
for
she
felt
a
breathless
fear
that
in
spite
of
his
being
so
manifestly
gone
he
yet
would
hear
her
somehow
if
she
made
a
noise
and
come
back
stole
along
it
and
down
the
stairs
into
the
entrance
hall
where
hung
enormously
a
giant
conspicuous
and
convenient
in
an
hôtel
that
supplied
no
to
answer
questions
and
whose
was
particularly
restless
nobody
was
in
the
hall
it
was
not
an
hour
of
arrival
or
departure
and
the
man
in
the
green
apron
she
had
seen
there
before
who
at
odd
moments
became
that
which
in
better
hôtels
is
uninterruptedly
a
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
either
she
had
to
get
on
a
chair
the
trains
to
berlin
were
so
high
up
on
the
great
sheet
and
tremblingly
she
kept
an
eye
on
the
street
door
through
whose
glass
panels
she
could
see
people
passing
up
and
down
the
street
and
they
in
their
turn
could
and
did
see
her
yes
there
was
a
night
train
at
it
came
from
rome
travellers
might
arrive
by
it
the
hôtel
door
would
be
open
her
thoughts
flew
it
got
to
berlin
at
six
something
of
the
morning
after
the
next
morning
suddenly
the
glass
door
opened
and
she
jumped
so
violently
that
she
nearly
fell
off
her
chair
and
she
fled
upstairs
without
even
looking
to
see
if
it
were
ingram
safe
in
her
room
she
was
horrified
at
herself
for
such
a
panic
how
was
she
going
to
do
everything
there
was
to
be
done
if
she
were
like
that
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
twisting
her
hands
if
in
her
life
she
had
needed
complete
and
clear
thinking
and
calm
acting
she
knew
it
was
now
but
how
to
keep
calm
and
clear
when
her
body
was
shaking
with
fear
she
felt
standing
there
struggling
with
herself
so
entirely
forlorn
so
entirely
cut
off
from
warmth
and
love
so
horribly
with
nothing
she
could
look
back
to
and
believe
in
and
nothing
she
could
look
forward
to
and
hope
in
that
just
to
speak
to
somebody
just
to
speak
to
a
stranger
who
because
he
was
a
stranger
would
have
no
prejudices
against
her
would
simply
recognise
a
familiar
distress
for
surely
the
other
human
beings
in
the
hôtel
must
all
at
some
time
have
been
unhappy
seemed
a
thing
of
comfort
beyond
expressing
her
longing
was
intolerable
to
get
close
for
a
moment
to
another
human
soul
to
ask
of
it
how
it
had
fared
when
it
too
went
down
into
the
sea
without
ships
leaving
its
ships
all
burned
behind
it
and
yet
its
business
had
inexorably
been
in
deep
waters
oh
have
you
been
unhappy
too
she
wanted
to
ask
of
it
have
you
sometimes
been
very
unhappy
dear
please
tell
me
have
you
sometimes
felt
cold
but
there
was
no
one
there
was
no
brotherhood
in
the
world
except
at
the
rare
obvious
moments
of
common
catastrophes
and
deaths
she
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
one
that
night
was
the
hour
of
her
escape
and
somehow
between
now
and
then
she
must
get
the
money
perhaps
by
some
chance
he
had
left
it
in
his
room
forgotten
in
a
moment
of
carelessness
in
the
pocket
of
the
coat
he
had
changed
when
they
arrived
that
afternoon
it
was
not
likely
for
he
was
she
had
noticed
of
an
extreme
neatness
and
care
about
all
such
things
he
never
forgot
he
never
mislaid
still
there
was
the
chance
she
opened
the
door
again
this
time
in
deadly
fear
for
perhaps
he
would
be
coming
back
not
choosing
after
all
to
stay
out
there
having
supper
there
was
no
one
in
the
passage
his
room
she
knew
was
farther
down
she
had
seen
him
going
into
it
four
doors
down
on
the
same
side
as
hers
she
went
out
and
stood
a
moment
listening
then
began
to
walk
along
towards
it
with
an
air
of
unconcern
as
though
rightfully
going
down
the
corridor
till
she
came
to
his
door
then
with
her
heart
in
her
mouth
she
bolted
in
the
lights
from
the
street
and
the
houses
opposite
shone
in
through
the
unshuttered
window
and
she
could
see
into
every
corner
of
the
shabby
hôtel
bedroom
a
reproduction
of
the
one
she
was
in
herself
trailed
over
dingily
by
traces
of
hundreds
of
commercial
travellers
and
smelling
memorially
as
hers
did
too
of
their
smoke
and
their
pomades
she
was
hot
and
cold
with
fear
guilty
as
a
thief
his
coat
hung
behind
the
door
she
ran
her
trembling
fingers
over
it
not
a
thing
in
any
of
his
pockets
nowhere
anything
that
she
could
see
his
unpacking
had
been
done
with
orderliness
itself
of
course
he
would
not
forget
his
with
a
gasp
that
was
almost
relief
she
slipped
out
of
the
room
shut
the
door
quickly
behind
her
and
assuming
what
she
tried
to
hope
was
an
unconcerned
swagger
a
sort
of
i
air
for
the
impressing
of
any
one
she
might
meet
walked
down
the
passage
again
just
as
she
reached
her
door
ingram
appeared
hurrying
up
the
stairs
two
steps
at
a
time
she
clutched
hold
of
the
handle
of
her
door
suddenly
unable
to
stand
i
i
she
began
but
he
did
not
seem
surprised
to
see
her
there
he
was
intent
on
something
else
just
think
he
said
coming
quickly
towards
her
i
left
my
in
my
room
full
of
notes
the
whole
afternoon
lying
in
the
drawer
of
the
table
i
wonder
he
hurried
past
her
almost
at
a
run
she
got
into
her
room
somehow
feeling
heaven
had
forsaken
her
after
a
minute
or
two
she
heard
him
coming
along
again
he
stopped
at
her
door
and
called
to
her
softly
it
all
right
it
was
still
there
was
it
lucky
very
said
ingeborg
but
so
faintly
that
he
did
not
hear
good
night
my
little
one
she
heard
him
say
now
i
going
out
to
get
that
supper
good
night
said
ingeborg
again
so
faintly
that
he
heard
nothing
and
after
a
pause
of
listening
he
went
away
she
tumbled
down
on
to
the
bed
she
felt
sick
it
was
a
quarter
past
ten
she
had
three
hours
to
wait
she
knew
what
she
was
going
to
do
try
to
do
at
one
she
would
take
off
her
shoes
and
go
down
the
passage
and
see
if
his
door
were
locked
he
would
be
asleep
he
must
oh
he
must
be
asleep
she
twisted
about
in
the
terror
that
smote
her
at
the
thought
that
he
might
perhaps
not
be
asleep
god
love
me
she
said
to
herself
i
his
child
have
i
sinned
and
repented
have
i
done
all
the
things
he
bound
to
help
me
to
save
me
it
the
wicked
he
saves
i
her
heart
stood
still
at
the
fearful
thought
that
perhaps
she
had
not
yet
been
after
all
wicked
enough
not
wicked
enough
to
be
saved
people
belonging
to
the
other
rooms
began
to
come
back
to
bed
somebody
in
the
next
room
sang
while
he
was
undressing
a
gay
italian
song
and
presently
he
smoked
and
the
smoke
came
in
under
the
door
between
her
room
and
his
she
lay
in
the
dark
or
rather
in
the
lights
and
shadows
of
the
uncurtained
room
and
every
two
or
three
minutes
a
tramcar
passed
and
shut
out
other
sounds
ingram
must
have
come
in
long
ago
when
it
was
midnight
she
got
up
and
arranged
her
shoes
and
hat
just
inside
the
door
so
that
she
could
seize
them
as
she
came
back
supposing
she
had
been
successful
and
rush
on
straight
downstairs
and
out
and
to
the
station
all
other
thoughts
were
now
lost
in
the
intentness
with
which
she
was
concentrated
on
what
she
had
to
do
exactly
next
she
would
not
let
herself
look
aside
at
the
abyss
yawning
if
she
were
not
successful
she
gripped
hold
of
the
thing
she
had
to
do
the
getting
of
the
money
and
fixed
her
whole
self
on
that
alone
she
lay
down
on
the
bed
again
her
hands
clenched
as
though
in
them
she
held
her
determination
once
her
thoughts
did
slip
off
to
robert
to
the
extreme
desolation
of
what
was
waiting
for
her
there
and
tears
came
through
her
tightly
shut
eyelids
it
what
you
deserved
she
whispered
struggling
to
stop
them
yes
but
has
deserved
it
robert
has
deserved
it
ruined
she
was
forced
to
go
on
she
shook
off
the
unnerving
thoughts
by
her
watch
it
was
a
quarter
to
one
she
stood
up
and
began
to
listen
the
tramcars
passed
now
only
every
ten
minutes
in
between
their
passing
the
hôtel
was
quiet
she
would
wait
for
the
approach
of
the
next
one
in
the
stillness
she
could
hear
it
coming
a
long
way
off
then
she
would
run
down
the
passage
in
her
stockinged
feet
to
ingram
door
and
open
it
just
as
the
noise
was
loudest
an
icy
hand
seemed
holding
her
heart
so
icy
that
it
burned
she
had
not
known
she
had
so
many
pulses
in
her
body
they
shook
her
and
shook
her
great
heavy
hammering
things
she
crept
to
her
door
and
opened
it
a
chink
there
was
a
dim
light
in
the
passage
she
heard
the
distant
rumbling
of
a
tramcar
now
she
must
run
but
she
could
not
she
stood
and
shook
there
it
was
coming
nearer
and
not
another
for
ten
minutes
she
began
to
sob
and
say
prayers
the
tramcar
struck
its
bell
sharply
it
had
reached
the
corner
of
the
piazza
it
would
be
passing
in
another
minute
she
wrenched
the
door
open
and
ran
like
a
flying
shadow
down
the
passage
and
just
as
the
car
was
at
its
loudest
turned
the
handle
of
ingram
door
it
was
not
locked
she
stood
inside
the
tramcar
rumbled
away
into
the
distance
ingram
she
nearly
wept
for
relief
was
breathing
deeply
was
asleep
but
how
funny
she
thought
after
one
terrified
glance
at
him
as
he
lay
in
the
bar
of
light
the
street
lamp
cast
on
the
bed
thinking
with
a
top
layer
of
attention
while
underneath
she
was
entirely
concentrated
on
the
how
funny
to
go
to
bed
in
one
beard
she
stole
over
to
the
table
and
peered
about
frantically
among
the
things
scattered
on
it
saw
nothing
began
with
breathless
care
to
try
to
open
its
drawer
noiselessly
listening
all
the
while
for
the
least
pause
in
the
breathing
on
the
bed
and
all
the
while
with
the
foolish
detached
layer
of
thoughts
running
in
her
head
like
some
senseless
tune
to
go
to
bed
in
a
beard
to
sleep
in
a
thing
like
that
not
to
take
it
off
at
night
and
hang
it
up
outside
the
door
with
one
clothes
and
have
it
properly
brushed
the
drawer
creaked
as
it
opened
the
regular
breathing
paused
she
stood
motionless
hit
rigid
with
terror
then
the
breathing
began
again
and
after
all
there
was
nothing
in
the
drawer
she
looked
round
the
room
in
despair
on
the
little
table
by
his
pillow
lay
his
watch
and
handkerchief
nothing
else
but
in
the
table
was
a
small
drawer
she
must
look
in
that
too
she
must
go
over
and
look
in
that
but
how
to
open
it
so
close
to
his
head
without
walking
him
she
crept
across
to
it
stopping
at
each
step
holding
her
breath
she
waited
and
listened
before
daring
to
take
another
the
drawer
was
not
quite
shut
and
the
slight
noise
of
pulling
its
chink
a
little
wider
did
not
interrupt
ingrain
breathing
she
put
in
her
hand
and
drew
out
the
drew
out
some
notes
italian
notes
the
first
she
found
a
handful
of
them
pushed
the
into
the
drawer
again
and
was
in
the
act
of
turning
to
run
when
she
was
rooted
to
the
floor
ingram
was
looking
at
her
his
eyes
were
open
and
he
was
looking
at
her
sleepily
hardly
awake
like
one
trying
to
focus
a
thought
she
stood
fascinated
with
horror
staring
at
him
not
able
to
move
her
hand
behind
her
back
clutching
the
money
then
he
put
out
his
arm
and
caught
her
dress
ingeborg
he
said
in
a
sleepy
wonder
still
half
in
the
deep
dreams
he
had
come
up
out
of
you
my
little
angel
love
you
you
come
yes
yes
she
stammered
trying
to
pull
her
dress
away
wild
with
fear
flinging
herself
as
usual
in
extremity
on
to
the
first
words
that
came
into
her
head
yes
yes
but
i
must
go
back
to
my
room
a
minute
just
one
minute
please
let
me
go
just
one
minute
i
forgotten
my
toothbrush
and
ingram
steeped
in
the
heaviness
of
the
first
real
sleep
he
had
had
for
nights
and
only
half
awake
murmured
with
the
happy
foolish
reasonableness
of
that
condition
do
be
long
then
sweetest
little
mate
and
let
her
go
chapter
xxxvii
two
days
later
the
porter
at
the
meuk
station
beheld
frau
pastor
dremmel
trying
to
open
the
door
of
a
compartment
in
the
early
afternoon
train
from
allenstein
and
going
to
her
assistance
there
being
no
other
passenger
to
distract
him
was
surprised
to
find
she
had
no
luggage
yet
only
the
week
before
with
his
own
hands
he
had
put
in
a
trunk
for
her
and
labelled
it
berlin
with
the
interest
of
a
lonely
man
whose
time
is
his
own
he
inquired
whether
she
had
lost
it
and
was
surprised
to
find
she
did
not
answer
he
then
told
her
or
rather
called
after
her
for
she
was
moving
away
that
the
pastoral
carriage
had
not
yet
come
for
her
and
was
surprised
again
for
again
she
did
not
answer
he
stood
watching
her
wondering
what
was
wrong
he
was
too
much
accustomed
to
dilapidations
and
dirt
in
himself
to
see
them
in
others
so
that
these
outer
signs
of
exhaustion
and
prolonged
travelling
escaped
him
puzzled
he
shook
his
head
as
she
disappeared
through
the
station
door
then
he
remembered
that
the
poor
lady
was
an
and
was
able
to
turn
away
calmed
with
the
satisfaction
of
him
who
has
found
the
right
label
and
stuck
it
on
meuk
as
she
passed
through
it
shook
its
head
over
her
too
consoling
itself
when
she
returned
no
greetings
did
not
even
seem
to
see
greetings
with
the
same
explanation
and
shrug
robertlet
and
ditti
walking
along
neatly
to
afternoon
school
and
suddenly
aware
of
the
approach
down
the
street
towards
them
of
a
disordered
parent
who
not
only
did
not
stop
but
apparently
did
not
see
them
murmured
to
each
other
being
by
now
well
instructed
by
their
grandmother
the
same
explanation
frau
dremmel
leaning
on
her
to
watch
her
charges
safely
round
the
corner
and
lingering
a
moment
in
the
mellow
summer
air
explained
her
who
went
by
without
a
glance
walking
conspicuously
in
the
middle
of
the
road
with
no
parcel
in
her
hand
to
legitimise
her
being
out
and
not
so
much
as
an
umbrella
to
give
her
a
countenance
just
with
empty
ungloved
hands
hanging
down
and
a
scandalous
scarcity
of
hairpins
and
her
clothes
all
twisted
in
the
same
brief
manner
baroness
glambeck
driving
towards
the
town
along
the
highroad
bent
on
one
of
those
errands
of
mercy
that
are
forced
at
intervals
upon
the
great
with
a
basket
of
the
properties
principally
jam
and
mittens
at
her
feet
endeavoured
though
vainly
to
mitigate
the
shock
she
received
on
being
cut
by
her
own
pastor
wife
and
a
pastor
wife
producing
curiously
the
effect
of
somehow
being
in
tatters
by
using
the
same
word
to
the
female
dependent
who
accompanied
her
on
these
occasions
because
somebody
had
to
carry
the
jam
the
very
birds
in
the
branches
being
german
birds
were
no
doubt
singing
it
the
dogs
as
they
met
her
scented
misfortune
and
barked
furiously
instantly
detecting
the
alien
angered
by
her
batteredness
discovering
nothing
in
her
clothes
however
diligently
they
sniffed
that
an
honest
german
dog
could
care
about
and
when
on
a
lonely
stretch
of
the
road
she
came
to
a
tramp
instead
of
begging
he
offered
her
a
drink
the
lane
turning
off
to
kökensee
was
so
lovely
that
afternoon
in
the
bright
bravery
of
early
summer
and
so
glanced
and
shone
and
darted
with
busy
birds
and
insects
and
the
glory
of
young
leaves
in
the
sun
that
the
dingy
human
figure
faltering
along
it
seemed
an
indecency
in
that
vigorous
world
what
place
was
there
for
blind
fatigue
in
that
world
of
triumph
what
place
for
a
failure
it
was
the
sort
of
day
that
used
to
make
ingeborg
heart
lift
up
now
she
saw
nothing
felt
nothing
except
that
the
sand
was
deep
she
began
to
cry
presently
because
the
sand
was
deep
it
seemed
to
give
way
on
purpose
beneath
her
feet
try
on
purpose
to
make
her
stumble
and
not
get
home
the
line
of
roofs
up
against
the
afternoon
sky
did
not
appear
to
come
any
nearer
and
yet
she
kept
on
trying
to
get
home
the
tears
fell
down
her
face
as
she
laboured
along
she
was
afraid
she
would
get
home
in
time
before
she
had
to
leave
off
walking
because
she
could
walk
any
farther
it
seemed
to
her
a
dreadful
thing
that
she
who
could
walk
so
well
should
not
be
able
to
walk
now
and
get
home
and
this
white
sand
how
fine
it
was
how
it
slid
away
on
each
side
of
one
feet
wherever
one
put
them
and
it
got
into
one
shoes
and
one
could
stop
and
empty
them
for
fear
if
one
sat
down
one
would
be
able
to
get
up
again
and
then
one
would
get
home
slower
and
more
slowly
she
laboured
along
by
the
time
she
reached
the
steep
part
just
before
the
village
she
was
crawling
like
a
hurt
insect
she
had
forgotten
to
eat
on
the
journey
and
in
milan
there
had
only
been
the
rusks
the
street
was
asleep
empty
that
fine
afternoon
the
inhabitants
away
at
work
in
the
fields
and
only
the
pig
and
the
geese
were
visible
in
the
parsonage
yard
luckily
the
gate
in
the
fence
that
shut
off
the
house
and
garden
was
not
latched
for
she
could
not
have
opened
it
but
would
have
stood
there
holding
on
to
it
and
foolishly
sobbing
till
some
one
came
and
helped
the
least
obstacle
now
would
be
a
thing
that
in
no
way
could
be
got
over
the
front
door
was
shut
and
sooner
than
go
up
the
steps
and
try
to
get
it
open
she
went
round
the
path
to
the
side
of
the
house
where
the
lilacs
grew
and
robert
window
was
that
way
she
could
reach
the
kitchen
whose
door
stood
always
open
and
was
level
with
the
garden
robert
would
be
out
in
his
fields
she
would
go
into
his
laboratory
and
wait
for
him
nobody
but
robert
yet
she
had
come
back
before
the
end
of
her
leave
his
shame
was
not
yet
public
property
if
he
just
beat
her
she
thought
in
a
disinterested
weak
way
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
would
that
do
then
no
one
need
ever
know
and
he
could
stay
on
in
kökensee
and
go
on
with
his
work
and
she
would
have
ruined
him
it
was
the
thought
of
having
ruined
robert
that
clove
her
heart
in
two
to
have
ruined
him
when
all
her
ambition
and
all
her
hope
had
been
to
make
him
so
happy
well
did
she
know
that
a
pastor
whose
wife
had
broken
the
seventh
commandment
would
be
driven
out
would
be
impossibly
scandalous
in
any
parish
and
her
not
having
broken
it
was
quite
beside
the
point
it
did
matter
what
you
did
do
so
long
as
you
looked
as
though
you
had
done
it
and
if
robert
killed
her
it
would
help
him
either
he
would
have
done
the
only
decent
thing
as
the
baroness
and
her
son
hildebrand
had
said
that
time
long
ago
and
avenged
his
honour
in
the
proper
german
way
but
there
were
drawbacks
to
avenging
one
honour
one
was
illogically
punished
for
doing
it
and
even
though
it
were
mild
punishment
any
punishment
ended
a
pastor
career
she
crept
round
the
corner
of
the
house
she
was
so
tired
that
if
she
had
to
wait
for
him
long
in
his
laboratory
she
felt
sure
she
would
be
able
to
keep
awake
well
if
he
came
in
and
killed
her
while
she
was
asleep
it
would
be
for
her
the
pleasantest
thing
she
was
so
very
tired
that
it
would
be
nice
she
thought
vaguely
to
wake
up
afterwards
and
find
oneself
comfortably
dead
but
robert
was
not
in
his
fields
from
the
path
beneath
his
window
she
could
see
his
head
as
she
had
seen
it
hundreds
of
times
bending
over
his
desk
at
the
sight
she
stopped
and
her
heart
seemed
to
shrink
into
quite
a
little
scarcely
beating
thing
there
he
was
her
dishonoured
husband
the
being
who
in
her
life
had
been
kindest
to
her
had
loved
her
most
still
working
still
going
on
doggedly
among
the
ruins
she
had
created
up
to
the
last
moment
when
public
opinion
brutal
and
stupid
making
her
the
chief
thing
when
she
so
utterly
was
not
while
it
thrust
her
and
her
wishes
and
intimate
knowledge
aside
as
not
mattering
when
as
in
the
question
of
more
children
or
no
more
children
they
so
utterly
did
would
on
her
sole
account
on
the
sole
account
of
what
seemed
to
her
at
that
moment
the
most
profoundly
naturally
unimportant
thing
in
life
a
woman
who
had
been
silly
put
a
stop
to
his
fine
work
and
refuse
to
give
the
world
a
chance
to
profit
by
his
brains
well
she
could
think
about
that
now
she
could
hold
on
to
any
of
her
thoughts
for
more
than
an
instant
she
only
knew
that
the
moment
had
come
for
facing
him
and
that
she
was
very
tired
she
really
was
extraordinarily
tired
her
mind
was
just
as
dim
and
reluctant
to
move
as
her
body
whatever
robert
was
going
to
do
to
her
she
would
cling
to
him
with
her
arms
round
his
neck
while
he
did
it
she
was
so
tired
that
she
thought
if
he
did
mind
her
just
putting
her
arms
round
his
neck
she
would
very
likely
go
to
sleep
while
he
beat
her
but
poor
robert
she
thought
how
hot
it
was
going
to
make
him
to
have
to
be
violent
to
have
to
beat
it
was
not
at
all
good
beating
weather
and
it
was
almost
a
pity
to
waste
punishment
on
somebody
too
tired
to
be
able
properly
to
appreciate
it
to
take
it
as
it
were
properly
in
she
moved
along
down
the
path
towards
the
back
door
when
one
came
to
think
of
it
it
was
a
strange
thing
to
be
going
in
to
robert
to
be
hurt
well
but
she
had
deserved
it
she
perfectly
understood
about
his
honour
and
its
needs
oh
yes
she
perfectly
understood
that
a
man
has
to
what
had
she
just
been
going
to
think
what
does
a
man
have
to
oh
well
if
only
what
he
did
to
her
could
blot
out
every
consequence
of
what
she
had
done
to
him
be
a
full
perfect
and
sufficient
no
that
was
profane
tiresome
how
one
thought
in
the
phrases
of
the
and
how
difficult
it
was
if
one
had
had
much
to
do
with
not
to
be
profane
as
it
was
her
punishment
would
do
anybody
any
good
that
she
could
see
funny
the
punishment
idea
of
what
use
was
it
really
the
consequences
of
the
things
one
did
were
surely
enough
in
their
devastating
effect
why
increase
devastation
and
forgiveness
did
seem
to
be
of
much
use
either
it
blotted
out
the
past
she
had
heard
people
in
pulpits
say
but
it
did
blot
out
the
future
that
daily
living
among
consequences
which
she
perceived
was
going
to
be
so
dreadful
well
she
could
think
now
and
here
was
the
kitchen
door
and
here
yes
was
that
klara
staring
at
her
arrested
in
the
middle
of
emptying
a
bucket
why
did
she
stare
at
her
did
she
then
exclaimed
klara
dropping
the
bucket
yes
evidently
klara
knew
she
thought
dragging
her
dusty
feet
across
the
kitchen
into
the
passage
and
was
what
one
said
in
germany
when
one
disgraced
mistress
came
back
instead
of
well
it
did
matter
the
dark
little
passage
one
almost
had
to
grope
one
way
along
it
when
the
front
door
was
shut
and
it
had
not
been
aired
apparently
since
she
went
away
and
it
was
heavy
and
choked
with
kitchen
smell
she
supposed
it
must
be
this
thickness
of
atmosphere
that
made
her
on
robert
doormat
with
her
hand
on
the
latch
feel
suddenly
so
very
like
fainting
and
it
really
was
dark
surely
it
only
seem
dark
because
she
suddenly
could
see
alarmed
she
remembered
how
she
had
fainted
after
her
journey
back
from
lucerne
was
she
then
to
go
through
life
making
at
intervals
journeys
back
and
fainting
at
the
critical
moment
at
their
end
in
terror
lest
she
should
do
it
now
if
she
waited
a
moment
longer
and
so
twist
things
round
in
that
dishonourable
womanly
way
which
commits
the
wrong
and
then
bringing
in
the
appeal
of
bodily
weakness
secures
the
comforting
secures
almost
the
apology
she
seized
all
her
courage
swept
its
fragments
together
into
a
firm
clutching
and
opened
the
door
herr
dremmel
was
at
his
table
writing
he
did
not
look
up
robert
she
said
faintly
her
back
against
the
door
her
hands
behind
her
spread
out
and
clinging
to
it
here
i
am
herr
dremmel
continued
writing
he
was
to
all
appearances
absorbed
and
his
forehead
that
hot
afternoon
was
covered
with
the
drops
of
concentration
robert
she
said
at
last
again
in
a
voice
that
shook
however
hard
she
tried
to
keep
it
steady
here
i
am
herr
dremmel
finished
his
sentence
then
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
her
staring
back
at
him
in
misery
and
fear
and
yet
beside
the
fear
with
a
dreadful
courage
she
recognised
the
look
it
was
the
look
he
had
when
he
was
collecting
his
attention
bringing
it
up
from
distant
deep
places
to
the
surface
to
herself
how
strange
that
he
should
at
this
moment
have
to
collect
it
that
it
did
not
instantly
spring
at
her
that
she
and
the
havoc
she
had
brought
into
his
life
should
not
be
soaked
into
every
part
of
his
consciousness
what
did
you
say
ingeborg
he
said
looking
at
her
with
that
so
recognisable
look
for
all
her
study
of
him
she
felt
she
did
not
yet
know
robert
i
only
said
she
stammered
that
i
that
here
that
here
i
he
looked
at
her
for
a
further
space
of
silence
then
it
flashed
upon
her
that
he
was
dreadfully
pretending
he
was
acting
he
was
going
to
torment
her
before
punishing
her
he
was
going
to
be
slowly
cruel
herr
dremmel
as
though
he
were
gathering
himself
together
gathering
himself
she
thought
watching
him
and
growing
cold
at
his
uncanniness
for
a
horrible
spring
inquired
of
her
if
she
had
walked
yes
said
ingeborg
even
more
faintly
her
eyes
full
of
watchful
fear
he
continued
to
look
at
her
but
his
hand
while
he
did
so
felt
about
on
the
table
for
the
pen
he
had
laid
down
she
recognized
this
look
too
amazing
horrible
how
he
could
act
it
was
the
one
he
had
when
talking
to
somebody
a
new
illumination
of
the
subject
he
was
writing
about
came
into
his
mind
she
felt
sure
now
that
the
worst
was
going
to
happen
to
her
but
first
there
was
to
be
torture
a
long
playing
about
these
revealed
depths
of
cunning
cruelty
in
him
of
talent
for
cleverest
acting
froze
her
blood
where
was
robert
the
man
of
large
simplicities
she
believed
she
had
known
it
was
a
strange
man
then
she
had
been
living
with
he
had
never
through
all
the
years
been
the
one
she
thought
she
had
married
she
said
holding
out
both
her
hands
robert
do
you
wo
you
be
natural
he
still
looked
at
her
in
silence
then
he
said
with
a
sudden
air
of
remembering
did
you
get
your
boots
ingeborg
this
was
dreadful
that
he
should
even
talk
about
the
boots
throw
in
her
face
that
paltry
preliminary
lying
you
i
did
she
said
tears
of
shame
for
him
that
he
could
be
so
cruel
coming
into
her
eyes
again
herr
dremmel
looked
at
her
as
though
collecting
as
though
endeavouring
to
remember
and
to
find
i
know
he
repeated
after
a
pause
of
reflective
gazing
during
which
ingeborg
had
flushed
vividly
and
gone
white
again
so
much
shocked
was
she
at
the
glimpse
she
was
getting
into
inhumanity
it
was
devilish
she
thought
but
robert
devilish
her
universe
seemed
tumbling
about
her
ears
i
think
she
said
lifting
her
head
with
the
pride
he
ought
to
have
felt
and
so
evidently
so
lamentably
did
one
should
give
punishment
like
a
man
there
was
another
pause
during
which
herr
dremmel
with
his
eyes
on
hers
appeared
to
ruminate
then
he
said
did
you
have
a
pleasant
time
this
was
fiendish
even
when
acting
thought
ingeborg
there
were
depths
of
baseness
the
decent
refused
to
portray
i
think
she
said
in
a
trembling
voice
if
you
would
mind
leaving
off
pretending
oh
she
broke
off
pressing
her
hands
together
the
good
robert
what
the
do
let
us
waste
time
do
make
it
worse
more
hideous
you
got
my
letter
you
know
all
about
it
your
letter
said
herr
dremmel
she
begged
him
she
entreated
him
to
leave
off
pretending
do
keep
on
like
this
she
besought
it
such
a
dreadful
way
of
doing
it
it
so
unworthy
ingeborg
said
herr
dremmel
will
you
not
cultivate
calm
have
journeyed
and
you
have
walked
but
you
have
done
neither
sufficiently
to
justify
intemperateness
perhaps
if
you
must
be
intemperate
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
go
and
be
so
in
your
own
room
then
we
shall
neither
of
us
disturb
the
other
no
said
ingeborg
wringing
her
hands
no
i
wo
go
i
wo
go
into
any
other
room
till
you
finished
with
me
but
said
herr
dremmel
i
have
finished
with
you
and
i
wish
he
added
pulling
out
his
watch
to
have
tea
i
am
driving
to
my
fields
at
five
oh
robert
she
begged
inexpressibly
shocked
he
meant
to
go
on
tormenting
her
then
indefinitely
please
please
do
whatever
going
to
do
to
me
and
get
it
over
here
i
am
only
to
be
punished
punished
repeated
herr
dremmel
why
cried
ingeborg
her
eyes
bright
with
grief
and
shame
for
this
steady
persistence
in
baseness
why
i
do
think
you
to
punish
me
you
not
to
punish
a
decent
woman
you
contemptible
herr
dremmel
stared
this
he
then
said
is
abuse
at
least
he
added
it
bears
a
close
resemblance
to
that
which
in
a
reasonable
human
being
would
be
abuse
however
ingeborg
speech
in
you
does
not
as
i
have
often
observed
accurately
represent
meaning
i
should
rather
say
he
amended
a
meaning
she
moved
across
to
the
table
to
him
her
eyes
shining
he
held
his
pen
ready
to
go
on
writing
so
soon
as
she
should
be
good
enough
to
leave
off
interrupting
robert
she
said
leaning
with
both
hands
on
the
table
her
voice
shaking
i
i
never
thought
i
have
to
be
of
you
i
could
bear
anything
but
having
to
be
of
you
perhaps
then
ingeborg
said
herr
dremmel
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
go
and
be
ashamed
of
me
in
your
own
room
then
we
shall
neither
of
us
disturb
the
other
you
are
being
so
horrible
that
you
twisting
things
all
wrong
and
putting
me
in
the
position
of
having
to
forgive
when
it
who
got
to
forgive
pray
then
ingeborg
go
and
forgive
me
in
your
own
room
then
we
shall
neither
of
us
you
being
cruel
oh
but
it
unbelievable
you
my
husband
playing
with
me
like
a
cat
with
a
miserable
mouse
a
miserable
sorry
mouse
something
helpless
that
ca
do
anything
back
and
would
if
it
could
and
see
how
you
make
me
talk
when
it
you
who
ought
to
be
talking
do
do
robert
begin
to
talk
begin
to
say
things
do
things
get
it
over
you
had
my
letter
you
know
perfectly
what
i
did
i
have
had
no
letter
ingeborg
how
dreadful
of
you
to
say
that
she
cried
her
face
full
of
horror
at
him
when
you
know
you
have
and
you
know
i
know
you
have
that
letter
i
left
for
you
on
this
table
i
have
seen
no
letter
on
this
table
but
i
it
here
i
put
it
she
lifted
her
hand
to
point
out
passionately
the
very
spot
to
him
and
underneath
her
hand
was
the
letter
her
heart
gave
one
great
bump
and
seemed
to
stop
beating
the
letter
was
where
she
had
put
it
and
was
unopened
she
looked
up
at
herr
dremmel
she
turned
red
she
turned
white
she
tasted
the
very
extremity
of
shame
i
beg
your
pardon
she
whispered
herr
dremmel
wore
a
slight
air
of
apology
one
omits
occasionally
to
notice
he
said
yes
breathed
ingeborg
she
stood
quite
still
her
eyes
on
his
face
he
pulled
out
his
watch
perhaps
now
ingeborg
he
said
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
see
about
tea
i
am
driving
to
my
fields
yes
breathed
ingeborg
he
bent
over
his
work
and
began
writing
again
she
put
out
her
hand
and
slowly
took
up
the
letter
tradition
copious
imbibing
of
the
precepts
of
bishops
were
impelling
her
towards
that
action
frequently
fatal
to
the
permanent
peace
of
families
the
making
of
a
clean
breast
do
you
do
you
do
you
want
to
she
began
tremblingly
half
holding
out
the
letter
then
her
voice
failed
and
her
principles
failed
and
the
precepts
of
a
lifetime
failed
and
she
put
it
in
her
pocket
it
stale
she
whispered
explaining
but
herr
dremmel
went
on
writing
he
had
forgotten
the
letter
she
turned
away
and
went
slowly
towards
the
door
in
the
middle
of
the
room
she
hesitated
and
looked
back
i
i
to
kiss
you
she
faltered
but
herr
dremmel
went
on
writing
he
had
forgotten
ingeborg
the
end
