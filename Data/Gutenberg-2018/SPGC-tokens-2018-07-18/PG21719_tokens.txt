chapter
one
hot
work
in
the
soudan
the
false
step
there
is
a
dividing
ridge
in
the
great
northern
wilderness
of
america
whereon
lies
a
lakelet
of
not
more
than
twenty
yards
in
diameter
it
is
of
crystal
clearness
and
profound
depth
and
on
the
still
evenings
of
the
indian
summer
its
surface
forms
a
perfect
mirror
which
might
serve
as
a
for
a
redskin
princess
we
have
stood
by
the
side
of
that
lakelet
and
failed
to
note
the
slightest
symptom
of
motion
in
it
yet
somewhere
in
its
centre
there
was
going
on
a
constant
and
mysterious
division
of
watery
particles
and
those
of
them
which
glided
imperceptibly
to
the
right
flowed
southward
to
the
atlantic
while
those
that
trembled
to
the
left
found
a
by
the
frozen
shores
of
hudson
bay
as
it
is
with
the
flow
and
final
exit
of
those
waters
so
is
it
sometimes
if
not
always
with
the
spirit
and
destiny
of
man
miles
milton
our
hero
at
the
age
of
nineteen
stood
at
the
dividing
ridge
of
his
life
if
the
oscillating
spirit
trembling
between
right
and
wrong
had
decided
to
lean
to
the
right
what
might
have
been
his
fate
no
one
can
tell
he
paused
on
the
balance
a
short
time
then
he
leaned
over
to
the
left
and
what
his
fate
was
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
volume
to
disclose
at
the
outset
we
may
remark
that
it
was
not
unmixed
good
neither
was
it
unmitigated
evil
miles
had
a
strong
body
a
strong
will
and
a
somewhat
passionate
temper
a
compound
which
is
closely
allied
to
dynamite
his
father
unfortunately
was
composed
of
much
the
same
materials
the
consequences
were
sometimes
explosive
it
might
have
profited
the
son
much
had
he
studied
the
scripture
lesson
children
obey
your
parents
in
the
lord
not
less
might
it
have
benefited
the
father
to
have
pondered
the
words
fathers
provoke
not
your
children
to
wrath
young
milton
had
set
his
heart
on
going
into
the
army
old
milton
had
resolved
to
thwart
the
desire
of
his
son
the
mother
milton
a
meek
and
loving
soul
experienced
some
hard
times
between
the
two
both
loved
intensely
and
each
loved
himself
not
better
perhaps
but
too
much
it
is
a
sad
task
to
have
to
recount
the
disputes
between
a
father
and
a
son
we
shrink
from
it
and
turn
away
suffice
it
to
say
that
one
day
miles
and
his
father
had
a
vesuvian
meeting
on
the
subject
of
the
army
the
son
became
petulant
and
unreasonable
the
father
fierce
and
tyrannical
the
end
was
that
they
parted
in
anger
go
sir
cried
the
father
sternly
when
you
are
in
a
better
frame
of
mind
you
may
return
yes
father
i
will
go
cried
the
son
starting
up
and
i
will
return
poor
youth
he
was
both
right
and
wrong
in
this
prophetic
speech
he
did
return
home
but
he
did
not
return
to
his
father
with
fevered
pulse
and
throbbing
heart
he
rushed
into
a
plantation
that
lay
at
the
back
of
his
father
house
he
had
no
definite
intention
save
to
relieve
his
feelings
by
violent
action
running
at
full
speed
he
came
suddenly
to
a
disused
quarry
that
was
full
of
water
it
had
long
been
a
familiar
haunt
as
a
many
a
time
in
years
past
had
he
leaped
off
its
precipitous
margin
into
the
deep
water
and
wantoned
there
in
all
the
abandonment
of
exuberant
youth
the
leap
was
about
thirty
feet
the
depth
of
water
probably
greater
constant
practice
had
rendered
miles
so
expert
at
diving
and
swimming
that
he
had
come
to
feel
as
much
at
home
in
the
water
as
a
casting
off
his
garments
he
took
the
accustomed
plunge
by
way
of
cooling
his
heart
and
brain
he
came
up
from
the
depths
refreshed
but
not
restored
to
equanimity
while
dressing
the
sense
of
injustice
returned
as
strongly
as
before
and
with
it
the
hot
indignation
so
that
on
afterwards
reaching
the
highway
he
paused
only
for
a
few
moments
this
was
the
critical
point
slowly
but
decidedly
he
leaned
to
the
left
he
turned
his
back
on
his
father
house
and
caused
the
stones
to
spurt
from
under
his
heels
as
he
walked
rapidly
away
if
miles
milton
had
thought
of
his
mother
at
that
time
he
might
have
escaped
many
a
day
of
bitter
repentance
for
she
was
as
gentle
as
her
husband
was
harsh
but
the
angry
youth
either
forgot
her
at
the
moment
or
more
probably
thrust
the
thought
of
her
away
poor
mother
if
she
had
only
known
what
a
conflict
between
good
and
evil
was
going
on
in
the
breast
of
her
boy
how
she
would
have
agonised
in
prayer
for
him
but
she
did
not
know
there
was
however
one
who
did
know
who
loved
him
better
even
than
his
mother
and
who
watched
and
guarded
him
throughout
all
his
chequered
career
it
is
not
improbable
that
in
spite
of
his
resolves
miles
would
have
relented
before
night
and
returned
home
had
not
a
very
singular
incident
intervened
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
that
day
a
notorious
swindler
had
been
tracked
by
a
detective
to
the
manufacturing
city
to
which
miles
first
directed
his
steps
the
bills
describing
the
swindler
set
forth
that
he
was
quite
young
tall
handsome
with
black
curling
hair
and
a
budding
moustache
that
he
was
dressed
in
grey
tweeds
and
had
a
prepossessing
manner
now
this
chanced
to
be
in
some
respects
an
exact
description
of
miles
milton
the
budding
moustache
to
be
sure
was
barely
discernible
still
it
was
sufficiently
so
for
a
detective
to
found
on
his
dress
too
was
brown
tweed
not
grey
but
of
course
dresses
can
be
changed
and
as
to
his
manner
there
could
not
be
two
opinions
about
that
now
it
chanced
to
be
past
one
when
miles
entered
the
town
and
felt
himself
impelled
by
familiar
sensations
to
pause
in
front
of
an
it
was
a
poor
in
a
low
district
but
miles
was
not
particular
still
further
it
was
a
temperance
but
miles
cared
nothing
for
strong
drink
strong
health
and
spirits
had
served
his
purpose
admirably
up
to
that
date
inside
the
there
sat
several
men
of
the
artisan
class
and
a
few
of
the
nondescript
variety
among
the
latter
was
the
detective
he
was
engaged
with
a
solid
oho
escaped
softly
from
his
lips
when
his
sharp
eyes
caught
sight
of
our
hero
so
softly
did
he
utter
the
exclamation
that
it
might
have
been
a
mere
remark
of
appreciation
addressed
to
the
steak
from
which
he
did
not
again
raise
his
eyes
for
a
considerable
time
the
place
was
very
full
of
people
so
full
that
there
seemed
scarcely
room
for
another
guest
but
by
some
almost
imperceptible
motion
the
man
made
a
little
space
close
to
himself
the
man
next
to
him
with
a
widened
the
space
by
similar
action
and
miles
perceiving
that
there
was
room
sat
down
bread
and
cheese
he
said
to
the
waiter
bread
an
cheese
sir
yessir
miles
was
soon
actively
engaged
in
mechanically
feeding
while
his
mind
was
busy
as
to
future
plans
presently
he
became
aware
that
the
men
on
either
side
of
him
were
scanning
his
features
and
person
with
peculiar
attention
coldish
weather
remarked
the
man
looking
at
him
in
a
friendly
way
it
is
replied
miles
civilly
enough
rather
cold
for
bathin
ai
it
sir
continued
the
detective
carelessly
picking
his
teeth
with
a
quill
how
did
you
know
that
i
been
bathing
demanded
miles
in
surprise
i
did
know
it
how
did
you
guess
it
then
vell
it
ai
difficult
to
guess
that
a
young
feller
bin
a
swim
you
see
the
of
hall
vet
an
lookin
as
if
it
done
dooty
for
a
towel
not
to
mention
veskit
bin
putt
on
in
a
so
as
the
buttons
ai
got
into
the
right
you
see
miles
laughed
and
resumed
his
bread
and
cheese
you
are
observant
i
perceive
he
said
not
wery
partiklarly
so
returned
redhair
but
i
do
obsarve
that
your
boots
tell
of
country
roads
was
it
a
long
way
hout
of
town
as
you
was
bathin
this
forenoon
now
there
was
a
free
and
easy
familiarity
about
the
man
tone
which
miles
resented
but
not
wishing
to
run
the
risk
of
a
disagreement
in
such
company
he
answered
quietly
yes
a
considerable
distance
it
was
in
an
old
quarry
where
i
often
bathe
close
to
my
father
house
ha
jest
so
about
to
the
willage
of
ramplin
you
last
night
if
report
speaks
true
an
you
left
the
unless
you
sunk
in
the
old
quarry
why
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
asked
miles
with
a
look
of
such
genuine
surprise
that
redhair
was
puzzled
and
the
man
with
the
hooked
nose
who
had
been
listening
attentively
looked
slightly
confused
read
that
sir
said
the
detective
extracting
a
newspaper
cutting
from
his
pocket
and
laying
it
on
the
table
before
miles
while
he
read
the
two
men
watched
him
with
interest
so
did
some
of
those
who
sat
near
for
they
began
to
perceive
that
something
was
in
the
wind
the
blood
sprang
to
the
youth
brow
as
he
read
and
perceived
the
meaning
of
the
man
remarks
at
this
redhair
and
nodded
to
each
other
significantly
you
do
mean
to
say
exclaimed
miles
in
a
tone
of
grand
indignation
which
confirmed
the
men
in
their
suspicion
that
you
think
this
description
applies
to
i
would
insinivate
too
much
sir
though
i
have
got
my
suspicions
said
redhair
blandly
but
of
course
that
easy
settled
for
if
your
father
is
hereabouts
your
father
wo
object
to
identify
his
son
ridiculous
exclaimed
miles
rising
angrily
at
this
interruption
to
his
plans
the
two
men
rose
promptly
at
the
same
moment
of
course
my
father
will
prove
that
you
have
made
a
mistake
but
he
hesitated
in
some
confusion
for
the
idea
of
before
his
father
so
soon
and
in
such
company
after
so
stoutly
asserting
that
he
would
more
return
was
humiliating
the
detective
observed
the
hesitation
and
became
jocose
if
you
rather
not
trouble
your
parent
said
redhair
you
got
no
call
to
do
it
the
station
ai
far
off
and
the
sooner
we
get
there
the
better
for
all
parties
a
slight
clink
of
metal
at
this
point
made
miles
aware
of
the
fact
that
was
drawing
a
pair
of
handcuffs
from
one
of
his
pockets
the
full
significance
of
his
position
suddenly
burst
upon
him
the
thought
of
being
led
home
a
prisoner
or
conveyed
to
the
handcuffed
maddened
him
and
the
idea
of
being
thus
unjustly
checked
at
the
very
outset
of
his
independent
career
made
him
furious
for
a
few
moments
he
stood
so
perfectly
still
and
quiet
that
the
detectives
were
thrown
slightly
off
their
guard
then
there
was
an
explosion
of
some
sort
within
the
breast
of
miles
milton
it
expended
itself
in
a
sudden
impulse
which
sent
redhead
flat
on
the
table
among
the
crockery
and
drove
into
the
fireplace
among
the
a
fat
little
man
chanced
to
be
standing
in
the
the
same
impulse
modified
shot
that
little
man
into
the
street
like
a
cork
out
of
a
bottle
and
next
moment
miles
was
flying
along
the
pavement
at
racing
speed
horrified
at
what
he
had
done
but
utterly
reckless
as
to
what
might
follow
hearing
the
shouts
of
pursuers
behind
him
and
being
incommoded
by
in
the
crowded
thoroughfare
miles
turned
sharply
into
a
and
would
have
easily
made
his
escape
being
uncommonly
swift
of
foot
had
he
not
been
observed
by
an
active
little
man
of
supple
frame
and
presumptuous
tendencies
unlike
the
mass
of
mankind
around
him
who
stared
and
wondered
the
active
little
man
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
joined
in
the
pursuit
kept
well
up
thus
forming
a
sort
of
between
the
fugitive
and
pursuers
and
even
took
upon
himself
to
shout
stop
thief
as
he
ran
miles
endeavoured
to
throw
him
off
by
putting
on
as
schoolboys
have
it
a
spurt
but
the
active
little
man
also
spurted
and
did
not
fall
far
behind
then
miles
tried
a
second
double
and
got
into
a
narrow
street
which
a
single
glance
showed
him
was
a
blind
alley
disappointment
and
anger
hereupon
took
possession
of
him
and
he
turned
at
bay
with
the
resolve
to
run
fortunately
for
himself
he
observed
a
pot
of
whitewash
standing
near
a
wall
with
a
dirty
canvas
frock
and
a
soiled
billycock
lying
beside
it
the
owner
of
the
property
had
left
it
inopportunely
for
quick
as
thought
miles
wriggled
into
the
frock
flung
on
the
billycock
seized
the
pot
and
walked
in
a
leisurely
way
to
the
head
of
the
alley
he
reached
it
just
as
the
active
little
man
turned
into
it
at
the
rate
of
ten
miles
an
hour
a
yell
of
stop
thief
issued
from
the
man
presumptuous
lips
at
the
moment
his
injunction
was
obeyed
to
the
letter
for
the
thief
of
an
honest
man
character
on
insufficient
evidence
was
stopped
by
bulky
person
so
violently
that
the
whitewash
was
scattered
all
about
and
part
of
it
went
into
the
active
man
eyes
to
squash
the
large
brush
into
the
little
man
face
and
thus
effectually
complete
what
his
own
recklessness
had
begun
was
the
work
of
an
instant
as
he
did
it
miles
assumed
the
role
of
the
injured
party
suiting
his
language
to
his
condition
what
mean
by
that
you
houtrageous
willain
he
cried
savagely
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
bystanders
who
instantly
formed
a
crowd
round
them
look
wot
a
mess
you
bin
an
made
o
my
clean
frock
do
you
see
the
poor
little
man
could
not
see
he
could
only
cough
and
gasp
and
wipe
his
face
with
his
i
give
you
in
charge
o
the
pleece
i
would
if
it
was
that
pretty
well
punished
yourself
continued
miles
take
to
a
pump
some
o
you
i
ai
got
time
do
go
for
to
run
into
a
hartist
again
with
a
in
so
saying
miles
pushed
through
the
laughing
crowd
and
sauntered
away
he
turned
into
the
first
street
he
came
to
and
then
went
forward
as
fast
as
was
consistent
with
the
idea
of
an
artisan
in
a
hurry
being
utterly
ignorant
of
the
particular
locality
into
which
he
had
penetrated
though
well
enough
acquainted
with
the
main
thoroughfares
of
the
city
his
only
care
was
to
put
as
many
intricate
streets
and
lanes
as
possible
between
himself
and
the
detectives
this
was
soon
done
and
thereafter
turning
into
a
darkish
passage
he
got
rid
of
the
and
borrowed
costume
fortunately
he
had
thrust
his
own
soft
cap
into
his
breast
at
the
time
he
put
on
the
billycock
and
was
thus
enabled
to
issue
from
the
dark
passage
very
much
like
his
former
self
with
the
exception
of
a
few
spots
of
whitewash
which
were
soon
removed
feeling
now
pretty
safe
our
hero
walked
a
considerable
distance
through
the
unknown
parts
of
the
city
before
he
ventured
to
inquire
the
way
to
thoroughfares
with
which
he
was
familiar
once
in
these
he
proceeded
at
a
smart
pace
to
one
of
the
railway
stations
intending
to
leave
town
though
as
yet
he
had
formed
no
definite
plan
of
action
in
truth
his
mind
was
much
troubled
and
confused
by
the
action
of
his
conscience
for
when
the
thought
of
leaving
home
and
entering
the
army
as
a
private
soldier
against
his
father
wishes
crossed
his
mind
conscience
faithfully
shook
his
head
and
when
softer
feelings
prevailed
and
the
question
arose
irresistibly
shall
i
return
home
the
same
faithful
friend
whispered
yes
in
a
state
of
indecision
miles
found
himself
borne
along
by
a
human
stream
to
the
immediately
in
front
of
him
were
two
soldiers
one
a
sergeant
and
the
other
a
private
of
the
line
both
were
tall
handsome
men
straight
as
arrows
and
with
that
air
of
power
which
is
as
far
removed
from
arrogance
as
it
is
from
cowardice
and
is
by
no
means
an
uncommon
feature
in
men
of
the
british
army
miles
felt
a
strong
unaccountable
attraction
towards
the
young
private
he
had
not
yet
heard
his
voice
nor
encountered
his
eye
indeed
being
behind
him
he
had
only
seen
his
and
as
the
expression
on
it
was
that
of
stern
gravity
the
attractive
power
could
not
have
lain
in
that
it
might
have
lain
in
the
youthful
look
of
the
lad
for
albeit
a
goodly
man
in
person
he
was
almost
a
boy
in
countenance
being
apparently
not
yet
twenty
years
of
age
miles
was
at
last
roused
to
the
necessity
for
prompt
and
decisive
action
by
the
voice
of
the
sergeant
saying
in
tones
of
authority
portsmouth
third
two
single
that
the
way
to
go
it
lobster
remarked
a
shabby
man
next
in
the
line
behind
miles
the
grave
sergeant
paid
no
more
regard
to
this
remark
than
if
it
had
been
the
squeak
of
a
mouse
now
then
sir
your
carridge
stops
the
way
shall
i
you
said
the
shabby
man
thus
admonished
miles
scarce
knowing
what
he
said
repeated
the
sergeant
words
portsmouth
third
two
single
vy
you
ai
agoin
to
pay
for
are
you
exclaimed
the
shabby
man
in
smiling
surprise
oh
beg
pardon
i
mean
said
miles
to
the
clerk
quickly
the
clerk
retracted
the
second
ticket
with
stolid
indifference
and
miles
hastening
to
the
platform
sat
down
on
a
seat
deeply
and
uncomfortably
impressed
with
the
fact
that
he
possessed
little
or
no
money
this
unsatisfactory
state
of
things
had
suddenly
burst
upon
him
while
in
the
act
of
paying
for
his
ticket
he
now
made
a
careful
examination
of
his
purse
and
found
its
contents
to
be
exactly
seven
shillings
and
sixpence
besides
a
few
coppers
in
his
again
indecision
assailed
him
should
he
return
it
was
not
too
late
yes
said
conscience
with
emphasis
no
said
shame
false
pride
echoed
the
word
and
it
still
our
hero
hesitated
and
there
is
no
saying
what
the
upshot
might
have
been
if
the
bell
had
not
rung
at
the
moment
and
now
then
take
your
seats
put
an
end
to
the
controversy
another
minute
and
miles
milton
was
seated
opposite
the
two
soldiers
rushing
towards
our
great
southern
seaport
at
the
rate
of
forty
miles
an
hour
chapter
two
shows
some
of
the
consequences
of
the
false
step
and
introduces
the
reader
to
peculiar
company
our
hero
soon
discovered
that
the
sergeant
was
an
old
campaigner
having
been
out
in
egypt
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
and
fought
at
the
famous
battle
of
in
his
grave
and
undemonstrative
way
and
quiet
voice
this
man
related
some
of
his
experiences
so
as
not
only
to
gain
the
attention
of
his
companion
in
arms
but
to
fascinate
all
who
chanced
to
be
within
earshot
of
him
not
the
least
interested
among
whom
of
course
was
our
friend
miles
as
the
sergeant
continued
to
expatiate
on
those
incidents
of
the
war
which
had
come
under
his
own
observation
three
points
impressed
themselves
on
our
hero
first
that
the
sergeant
was
evidently
a
man
of
serious
if
not
religious
spirit
second
that
while
he
gave
all
due
credit
to
his
comrades
for
their
bravery
in
action
he
dwelt
chiefly
on
those
incidents
which
brought
out
the
higher
qualities
of
the
men
such
as
uncomplaining
endurance
forbearance
etcetera
and
he
never
boasted
of
having
given
a
thorough
licking
to
the
egyptians
nor
spoke
disparagingly
of
the
native
troops
lastly
that
he
seemed
to
lay
himself
out
with
a
special
view
to
the
unflagging
entertainment
of
his
young
comrade
the
reason
for
this
last
purpose
he
learned
during
a
short
halt
at
one
of
the
stations
seeing
the
sergeant
standing
alone
there
miles
after
accosting
him
with
the
inevitable
references
to
the
state
of
the
weather
remarked
that
his
comrade
seemed
to
be
almost
too
young
for
the
rough
work
of
soldiering
yes
he
is
young
enough
but
older
than
he
looks
answered
the
sergeant
poor
lad
i
sorry
for
him
indeed
he
does
not
seem
to
me
a
fit
subject
for
pity
young
strong
handsome
intelligent
he
seems
pretty
well
furnished
to
begin
the
battle
of
life
especially
in
the
army
are
not
what
they
seem
returned
the
soldier
regarding
his
young
questioner
with
something
between
a
compassionate
and
an
amused
look
is
not
gold
that
glitters
soldiering
is
not
made
up
of
brass
bands
swords
and
red
coats
having
read
a
good
deal
of
history
i
am
well
aware
of
that
retorted
miles
who
was
somewhat
offended
by
the
implication
contained
in
the
sergeant
remarks
well
then
you
see
continued
the
sergeant
all
the
advantages
that
you
have
mentioned
and
which
my
comrade
certainly
possesses
weigh
nothing
with
him
at
all
just
now
because
this
sudden
call
to
the
wars
separates
him
from
his
poor
young
wife
wife
exclaimed
miles
why
he
seems
to
me
little
more
than
a
boy
except
in
size
and
perhaps
in
gravity
he
is
over
twenty
and
as
to
gravity
well
most
young
fellows
would
be
grave
enough
if
they
had
to
leave
a
pretty
young
wife
after
six
months
of
wedded
life
you
see
he
married
without
leave
and
so
even
if
it
were
a
time
of
peace
his
wife
would
not
be
recognised
by
the
service
in
wartime
he
must
of
course
leave
her
behind
him
it
has
been
a
hard
job
to
prevent
him
from
deserting
and
now
it
all
i
can
do
to
divert
his
attention
from
his
sorrow
by
stirring
him
up
with
tales
of
the
recent
wars
at
this
point
the
inexorable
bell
rang
doors
were
banged
whistles
sounded
and
the
journey
was
resumed
arrived
at
portsmouth
miles
was
quickly
involved
in
the
bustle
of
the
platform
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
have
some
private
conversation
with
the
sergeant
as
to
the
possibility
of
entering
her
service
as
a
private
soldier
and
was
on
the
point
of
accompanying
his
military
travelling
companions
into
the
comparative
quiet
of
the
street
when
a
porter
touched
his
cap
any
luggage
sir
luggage
a
no
no
luggage
it
was
the
first
moment
since
leaving
home
that
the
thought
of
luggage
had
entered
into
his
brain
that
thought
naturally
aroused
other
thoughts
such
as
lodgings
food
friends
funds
and
the
like
on
turning
to
the
spot
where
his
military
companions
had
stood
he
discovered
that
they
were
gone
running
to
the
nearest
he
found
it
to
be
the
wrong
one
and
before
he
found
the
right
one
and
reached
the
street
the
two
soldiers
had
vanished
from
the
scene
you
seem
to
be
a
stranger
here
sir
can
i
direct
you
said
an
insinuating
voice
at
his
elbow
the
speaker
was
an
elderly
man
of
appearance
and
polite
address
miles
did
not
quite
like
the
look
of
him
in
the
circumstances
however
and
with
a
strangely
desolate
feeling
of
loneliness
creeping
over
him
he
did
not
see
his
way
to
reject
a
civil
offer
thank
you
i
am
indeed
a
stranger
and
happen
to
have
neither
friend
nor
acquaintance
in
the
town
so
if
you
can
put
me
in
the
way
of
finding
a
respectable
lodging
a
a
one
you
will
greatly
oblige
me
with
pleasure
said
the
man
if
you
will
accompany
stay
do
trouble
yourself
to
show
me
the
way
interrupted
miles
just
name
a
house
and
the
street
that
will
no
trouble
at
all
sir
said
the
man
i
happen
to
be
going
in
the
direction
of
the
docks
and
know
of
excellent
as
well
as
cheap
lodgings
there
making
no
further
objection
miles
followed
his
new
friend
into
the
street
for
some
time
the
crowd
being
considerable
and
noisy
they
walked
in
silence
at
the
time
we
write
of
portsmouth
was
ringing
with
martial
music
and
preparations
for
war
at
all
times
the
and
the
are
prominent
in
the
streets
of
that
seaport
for
almost
the
whole
of
our
army
passes
through
it
at
one
period
or
another
either
in
going
to
or
returning
from
foreign
parts
but
at
this
time
there
was
the
additional
bustle
resulting
from
the
egyptian
war
exceptional
activity
prevailed
in
its
yards
and
hurry
in
its
streets
recruits
recently
enlisted
flocked
into
it
from
all
quarters
while
on
its
jetties
were
frequently
landed
the
sad
fruits
of
war
in
the
form
of
wounded
men
have
you
ever
been
in
portsmouth
before
asked
the
man
on
reaching
a
part
of
the
town
which
was
more
open
and
less
crowded
never
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
large
and
bustling
said
miles
the
crowding
and
bustling
is
largely
increased
just
now
of
course
in
consequence
of
the
war
in
egypt
returned
the
man
troops
are
constantly
embarking
and
others
returning
it
is
a
noble
service
men
start
in
thousands
from
this
port
young
hearty
healthy
and
full
of
spirit
they
return
those
of
them
who
return
at
all
sickly
and
with
no
spirit
at
all
except
what
they
soon
get
poured
into
them
by
the
publicans
yes
commend
me
to
the
service
of
my
queen
and
country
there
was
a
sneering
tone
in
the
man
voice
which
fired
his
easily
roused
indignation
mind
what
you
say
about
our
queen
while
in
company
said
miles
sternly
stopping
short
and
looking
the
man
full
in
the
face
i
am
a
loyal
subject
and
will
listen
to
nothing
said
in
disparagement
of
the
queen
or
of
her
majesty
forces
bless
you
sir
said
the
man
quickly
i
a
loyal
subject
myself
and
would
for
the
world
say
a
word
against
her
majesty
no
more
would
i
disparage
her
troops
but
after
all
the
army
ai
perfect
you
know
even
must
admit
that
sir
with
all
its
noble
qualities
room
for
improvement
there
was
such
an
air
of
sincerity
or
at
least
of
assumed
humility
in
the
man
tone
and
manner
that
miles
felt
it
unjustifiable
to
retain
his
indignation
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
all
at
once
repress
it
and
was
hesitating
whether
to
fling
off
from
the
man
or
to
forgive
him
when
the
sound
of
many
voices
and
of
feet
tramping
in
regular
time
struck
his
ear
and
diverted
his
attention
next
moment
the
head
of
a
regiment
accompanied
by
a
crowd
of
juvenile
admirers
swept
round
the
corner
of
the
street
at
the
same
instant
a
forest
of
bayonets
gleamed
upon
the
youth
vision
and
a
brass
band
burst
with
crashing
grandeur
upon
his
ear
sending
a
quiver
of
enthusiasm
into
the
deepest
recesses
of
his
soul
and
stirring
the
very
marrow
in
his
bones
miles
stood
entranced
until
the
regiment
had
passed
and
the
martial
strains
were
softened
by
distance
then
he
looked
up
and
perceived
that
his
shabby
companion
was
regarding
him
with
a
peculiar
smile
i
think
you
a
notion
of
being
a
soldier
he
said
with
a
smile
where
is
that
regiment
going
asked
miles
instead
of
answering
the
question
to
barracks
at
present
to
egypt
in
a
few
days
there
be
more
followin
it
before
long
it
was
a
distracting
as
well
as
an
exciting
walk
that
miles
had
through
the
town
for
at
every
turn
he
passed
couples
or
groups
of
soldiers
or
sailors
or
marines
and
innumerable
questions
sprang
into
and
jostled
each
other
in
his
mind
while
at
the
same
moment
his
thoughts
and
feelings
were
busy
with
his
present
circumstances
and
future
prospects
the
distraction
was
increased
by
the
remarks
and
comments
of
his
guide
and
he
would
fain
have
got
rid
of
him
but
as
well
as
forbade
his
casting
him
off
without
sufficient
reason
presently
he
stopped
without
very
well
knowing
why
in
front
of
a
large
imposing
edifice
looking
up
he
observed
the
words
soldiers
institute
in
large
letters
on
the
front
of
it
what
sort
of
an
institute
is
that
he
asked
oh
it
a
miserable
affair
where
soldiers
are
taken
in
cheap
as
they
say
an
done
for
returned
the
shabby
man
hurriedly
as
if
the
subject
were
distasteful
to
him
come
along
with
me
and
i
show
you
places
where
soldiers
ay
and
civilians
too
can
enjoy
themselves
like
gentlemen
an
get
value
for
their
money
as
he
spoke
two
men
issued
from
a
small
street
close
to
them
and
crossed
the
road
one
a
soldier
of
the
line
the
other
a
marine
here
it
is
jack
exclaimed
the
soldier
to
his
friend
miss
sarah
robinson
institoot
that
you
heard
so
much
about
come
an
show
you
where
you
can
write
your
letter
in
peace
thus
much
was
overheard
by
miles
as
they
turned
into
a
and
entered
what
was
obviously
one
of
the
poorer
districts
of
the
town
evidently
that
soldier
opinion
does
not
agree
with
yours
remarked
miles
as
they
walked
along
more
the
pity
returned
the
shabby
man
whose
name
he
had
informed
his
companion
was
sloper
now
we
are
getting
among
places
you
see
where
there
a
good
deal
of
drinking
going
on
i
scarcely
require
to
be
told
that
returned
miles
curtly
for
he
was
beginning
to
feel
his
original
dislike
to
mister
sloper
intensified
it
did
not
indeed
require
any
better
instructor
than
eyes
and
ears
to
inform
our
hero
that
the
around
him
were
full
and
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
shouting
and
swearing
revellers
inside
were
soldiers
and
seamen
by
this
time
it
was
growing
dark
and
most
of
the
were
beginning
to
send
forth
that
glare
of
intense
and
warm
light
with
which
they
so
knowingly
attract
the
human
moths
that
constitute
their
prey
here
we
are
said
sloper
stopping
in
front
of
a
in
a
narrow
street
this
is
one
o
the
lodgin
most
o
the
others
are
disreputable
it
not
much
of
a
neighbourhood
i
admit
it
certainly
is
not
very
attractive
said
miles
hesitating
you
said
you
wanted
a
cheap
one
returned
sloper
and
you
expect
to
have
it
cheap
and
fashionable
you
know
you
no
occasion
to
be
afraid
come
in
the
arguments
of
mr
sloper
might
have
failed
to
move
miles
but
the
idea
of
his
being
to
go
anywhere
was
too
much
for
him
go
in
then
he
said
firmly
and
followed
the
room
into
which
he
was
ushered
was
a
moderately
large
with
a
bar
and
a
number
of
tables
round
the
room
at
which
many
men
and
a
few
women
were
seated
some
gambling
others
singing
or
disputing
and
all
drinking
and
smoking
it
is
only
right
to
say
that
miles
was
shocked
hitherto
he
had
lived
a
quiet
and
comparatively
innocent
country
life
he
knew
of
such
places
chiefly
from
books
or
hearsay
or
had
gathered
merely
the
superficial
knowledge
that
comes
through
the
opening
of
a
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
stood
inside
a
low
breathing
its
polluted
atmosphere
and
listening
to
its
foul
language
his
first
impulse
was
to
retreat
but
false
shame
the
knowledge
that
he
had
no
friend
in
portsmouth
or
place
to
go
to
that
the
state
of
his
purse
forbade
his
indulging
in
more
suitable
accommodation
and
a
certain
pride
of
character
which
made
him
always
determine
to
carry
out
what
he
had
resolved
to
do
all
these
considerations
and
facts
combined
to
prevent
his
acting
on
the
better
impulse
he
doggedly
followed
his
guide
to
a
small
round
table
and
sat
down
prudence
however
began
to
operate
within
him
he
felt
that
he
had
done
wrong
but
it
was
too
late
now
he
thought
to
retrace
his
steps
he
would
however
be
on
his
guard
would
not
encourage
the
slightest
familiarity
on
the
part
of
any
one
and
would
keep
his
eyes
open
for
a
youth
who
had
seen
nothing
of
the
world
this
was
a
highly
commendable
resolve
what
you
drink
asked
mr
sloper
miles
was
on
the
point
of
saying
coffee
but
reflecting
that
the
beverage
might
not
be
readily
obtainable
in
such
a
place
he
substituted
beer
instead
of
calling
the
waiter
mr
sloper
went
himself
to
the
bar
to
fetch
the
liquor
while
he
was
thus
engaged
miles
glanced
round
the
room
and
was
particularly
struck
with
the
appearance
of
a
large
sailor
who
sat
at
the
small
table
next
to
him
with
hands
thrust
deep
into
his
his
chin
resting
on
his
broad
chest
and
a
solemn
owlish
stare
in
his
yet
manly
countenance
he
sat
alone
and
was
obviously
in
a
very
sulky
frame
of
mind
a
condition
which
he
occasionally
indicated
through
a
growl
of
dissatisfaction
as
miles
sat
wondering
what
could
have
upset
the
temper
of
a
tar
whose
visage
was
marked
by
the
unmistakable
lines
and
dimples
of
he
overheard
part
of
the
conversation
that
passed
between
the
barman
and
mr
sloper
what
have
they
got
hold
o
rattling
bill
asked
the
former
as
he
drew
the
beer
ay
worse
luck
returned
sloper
i
saw
the
sergeant
as
i
came
along
lead
him
over
to
miss
robinson
trap
confound
her
do
you
go
fur
to
say
anything
agin
miss
robinson
old
man
suddenly
growled
the
big
sailor
in
a
voice
so
deep
and
strong
that
it
silenced
for
a
moment
the
rest
of
the
company
leastways
you
may
if
you
like
but
if
you
do
i
knock
in
your
daylights
an
polish
up
your
so
as
your
own
mother
would
mistake
you
fur
a
battered
saucepan
the
seaman
did
not
move
from
his
position
as
he
uttered
this
alarming
threat
but
he
accompanied
it
with
a
portentous
frown
and
an
owlish
wink
of
both
eyes
what
have
joined
the
blue
lights
asked
sloper
with
a
smile
referring
to
the
name
by
which
the
religious
and
temperance
men
of
the
army
were
known
no
i
better
for
me
if
i
had
here
waiter
fetch
me
another
an
more
o
the
gin
than
the
warer
mind
heave
ahead
or
i
sink
you
having
been
supplied
with
a
fresh
dose
of
gin
and
water
the
seaman
appeared
to
go
to
sleep
and
miles
for
want
of
anything
better
to
do
accepted
sloper
invitation
to
play
a
game
of
dominoes
are
the
beds
here
pretty
good
he
asked
as
they
were
about
to
begin
yes
for
the
money
answered
sloper
that
a
lie
growled
the
big
sailor
they
bad
at
any
price
stuffed
wi
and
mr
sloper
received
this
observation
with
the
smiling
urbanity
of
a
man
who
eschews
war
at
all
costs
you
do
drink
he
said
after
a
time
referring
to
miles
pot
of
beer
which
he
had
not
yet
touched
miles
made
no
reply
but
by
way
of
answer
took
up
the
pot
and
put
it
to
his
lips
he
had
not
drunk
much
of
it
when
the
big
seaman
rose
hurriedly
and
staggered
between
the
two
tables
in
doing
so
he
accidentally
knocked
the
pot
out
of
the
youth
hand
and
sent
the
contents
into
mr
face
and
down
into
his
bosom
to
the
immense
amusement
of
the
company
that
man
of
peace
accepted
the
baptism
meekly
but
miles
sprang
up
in
sudden
anger
the
seaman
turned
to
him
however
with
a
benignantly
apologetic
smile
hallo
messmate
i
ax
your
parding
they
do
leave
room
even
for
a
scarecrow
to
go
about
in
this
here
cabin
i
stand
you
another
glass
give
us
your
flipper
there
was
no
resisting
this
it
was
said
so
heartily
miles
grasped
the
huge
hand
that
was
extended
and
shook
it
warmly
all
right
he
said
laughing
i
do
mind
the
beer
and
plenty
more
where
that
came
from
but

some
damage

exclaimed
the
shabby
man
as

wiped

on
a
bit
he
added
rising
i

to
change
my
shirt
wo
keep
you
waitin
long
another
pot
o
beer

said
the
sailor
to
the
barman
as
sloper
left
the
room
paying
for
the
drink
he
returned
and
put
the
pot
on
the
table
then
turning
to
miles
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
with
an
intelligent
look
come
outside
for
a
bit
messmate
i
wants
to
speak
to

rose
and
followed
the
man
in
much
surprise

he
said
when
a
few
yards
away
from
the
door
but

rascally
place

or
esquire
to
prop
it
up
the
way
in
which
the
sailor
squared
his
broad
shoulders
when
he
said
this
rendered
it
necessary
to
prop
himself
up
seeing
which
miles
afforded
the
needful
aid
by
taking
his
arm
in
a
friendly
way

exclaimed
miles
ay
wot
have
you
got
to
find
fault
wi
miss
robinson
demanded
the
sailor
sternly
no
fault
to
find
at
all
replied
miles
suffering
himself
to
be
hurried
away
by
his
new
friend
but
wherever
i
have
gone
since
arriving
in
portsmouth
her
name
has
cropped
up
in
portsmouth
echoed
the
sailor
let
me
tell
you
young
man
that
wherever
you
go
all
over
the
world
if
there
a
british
soldier
there
miss
sarah
robinson
name
will
be
sure
to
crop
up
why
do
you
know
that
she
soldiers
friend
i
afraid
i
must
confess
to
ignorance
on
the
point
yet
stay
now
you
couple
her
name
with
soldier
friend
i
have
got
a
faint
remembrance
of
having
heard
it
before
have
i
not
heard
of
a
miss
weston
too
in
connection
with
a
work
of
some
sort
among
sailors
ay
no
doubt
ye
have
she
has
a
grand
institoot
in
too
but
she
goes
in
for
sailors
all
over
the
kingdom
miss
robinson
goes
in
for
soldiers
an
sailors
both
though
mainly
for
the
soldiers
she
set
agoin
the
before
miss
weston
began
in
an
so
she
keeps
it
up
but
there
ai
no
opposition
or
rivalry
their
aims
is
pretty
much
alike
an
so
they
keep
stroke
together
wi
the
oars
but
i
tell
you
more
about
that
when
you
get
inside
here
we
are
there
the
you
see
and
that
queen
street
an
the
close
at
hand
it
a
teetotal
house
you
know
all
miss
robinson
institoots
is
that
indeed
how
comes
it
then
that
a
man
excuse
me
sheets
in
the
wind
can
gain
admittance
oh
as
to
that
any
sailor
or
soldier
may
get
admittance
even
if
as
drunk
as
a
fiddler
if
he
behaves
but
they
supply
drink
on
the
premises
or
allow
it
to
be
brought
in
inside
o
you
of
coorse
cause
why
you
ca
help
that
leastwise
not
without
the
help
of
a
plenty
o
men
who
ai
abstainers
go
to
sleep
every
night
at
the
they
find
the
beds
and
other
things
so
comfortable
in
fact
some
hard
topers
have
been
indooced
to
take
the
pledge
in
consekince
o
what
they
heard
an
seen
in
this
though
they
came
at
first
only
for
the
an
beds
here
let
me
look
at
you
under
this
here
lamp
yes
do
you
something
like
a
already
you
wo
object
to
change
hats
wi
me
why
asked
miles
somewhat
amused
never
you
mind
that
mate
you
just
putt
yourself
under
my
orders
if
you
sail
comfortably
before
the
wind
i
arrange
matters
an
you
can
square
up
in
the
morning
as
miles
saw
no
particular
reason
for
objecting
to
this
fancy
of
his
eccentric
friend
he
exchanged
his
soft
cap
for
the
sailor
straw
hat
and
they
entered
the
together
chapter
three
the
sailors
welcome
miles
has
a
night
of
it
and
enlists
his
friend
armstrong
has
an
agreeable
surprise
at
the
soldiers
institute
it
was
not
long
before
our
hero
discovered
the
reason
of
jack
solicitude
about
his
appearance
it
was
that
he
miles
should
pass
for
a
sailor
and
thus
be
in
a
position
to
claim
the
hospitality
of
the
to
the
inner
life
of
which
civilians
were
not
admitted
though
they
were
privileged
with
the
public
in
general
to
the
use
of
the
outer
come
here
jack
molloy
he
said
leading
his
friend
aside
when
he
made
this
discovery
you
pride
yourself
on
being
a
british
tar
do
you
i
does
said
jack
with
a
profound
solemnity
of
decision
that
comported
well
with
his
character
and
condition
and
you
would
scorn
to
serve
under
the
french
flag
or
the
turkish
flag
or
the
black
flag
or
any
flag
but
the
union
jack
would
you
right
you
are
mate
them
my
sentiments
to
a
tee
well
then
you
ca
expect
to
sail
under
false
colours
any
more
than
yourself
continued
miles
i
scorn
to
sail
into
this
port
under
your
straw
hat
so
i
strike
these
colours
bid
you
and
make
sail
for
another
port
where
a
civilian
will
be
welcome
molloy
frowned
at
the
floor
for
some
moments
in
stern
perplexity
you
took
the
wind
out
o
my
sails
entirely
you
have
he
replied
at
last
an
you
right
young
man
but
i
troubled
about
you
if
you
do
run
into
this
here
port
you
have
to
beat
about
in
the
offing
all
night
or
cast
anchor
in
the
streets
for
i
do
know
of
another
lodgin
in
you
could
hang
out
except
them
disrepitible
in
coorse
there
the
big
hotels
but
i
heerd
you
say
to
sloper
that
you
was
bound
to
do
things
cheap
bein
hard
up
never
mind
my
friend
said
miles
quickly
i
will
manage
somehow
so
and
many
thanks
to
you
for
the
interest
you
have
taken
in
avast
mate
there
no
call
to
go
into
action
in
sitch
a
hurry
this
here
opens
the
doors
of
its
bar
an
an
spreads
its
purvisions
before
all
an
sundry
as
can
afford
to
pay
its
moderate
demands
it
the
you
not
free
to
so
you
have
a
bit
supper
wi
me
before
you
set
sail
on
your
night
cruise
being
by
that
time
rather
hungry
as
well
as
fatigued
miles
agreed
to
remain
for
supper
while
they
were
engaged
with
it
he
was
greatly
impressed
with
the
number
of
sailors
and
marines
who
passed
into
the
beyond
the
bar
or
who
sat
down
at
the
numerous
tables
around
to
have
a
hearty
supper
which
they
washed
down
with
tea
and
coffee
instead
of
beer
or
gin
apparently
with
tremendous
appetite
and
much
satisfaction
look
ye
here
said
jack
molloy
rising
when
their
feed
was
about
concluded
i
no
doubt
they
wo
object
to
your
taking
a
squint
at
the
though
they
wo
let
you
use
it
following
his
companion
miles
passed
by
a
glass
double
door
into
an
enormous
warm
room
seventy
feet
long
and
of
proportionate
width
and
height
in
which
a
goodly
number
of
men
of
the
sea
were
busy
as
bees
some
of
them
reading
books
or
turning
over
illustrated
papers
and
magazines
others
smoking
their
pipes
and
enjoying
themselves
in
in
front
of
the
glowing
fire
chatting
laughing
and
yarning
as
as
if
in
their
native
while
a
few
were
examining
the
pictures
on
the
walls
or
the
large
models
of
ships
which
stood
at
one
side
of
the
room
at
the
upper
end
a
afforded
amusement
to
several
players
and
profound
interest
to
a
number
of
spectators
who
passed
their
comments
on
the
play
with
that
freedom
which
seems
to
be
a
product
of
fresh
gales
and
a
door
standing
partly
open
at
the
upper
end
of
this
apartment
revealed
a
large
hall
from
which
issued
faintly
the
sound
of
soft
music
ai
it
snug
and
there
no
gamblin
agoin
on
there
remarked
molloy
as
they
returned
to
their
table

how
the
house
is
patronised
i
tell
they
make
up
about
two
hundred
an
twenty
beds
in
it
altogether
an
these
are
every
night
one
way
or
another
they
had
thousand
men
more
or
less
as
slep
under
this
roof
last
year
so
i
bin
told
that
patronisin
ai
it
to
say
nothin
o
the
fellers
as
comes
for
grub
which
as
found
is
good
for
the
money
and
the
attendants
is
civil
you
see
they
always
kind
an
attentive
here
they
professes
to
think
more
of
our
souls
than
our
bodies
which
we
no
objection
to
see
for
the
lookin
arter
our
souls
includes
the
lookin
arter
our
bodies
an
they
do
bother
us
in
no
way
to
attend
their
an
sitchlike
there
they
are
in
separate
rooms
if
you
want
you
may
go
if
you
do
you
can
let
alone
no
compulsion
which
comes
quite
handy
to
some
on
us
for
i
do
myself
care
much
about
sitchlike
things
so
long
my
body
all
right
i
leaves
my
soul
to
look
arter
itself
as
the
seaman
said
this
with
a
smile
of
indifference
there
sprang
to
the
mind
of
his
young
companion
words
that
had
often
been
impressed
on
him
by
his
mother
what
shall
it
profit
a
man
if
he
should
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
his
own
soul
but
he
made
no
reference
to
this
at
the
time
continued
molloy
as
they
do
worrit
us
about
religion
except
to
give
us
a
good
word
an
a
blessin
now
an
again
and
a
little
book
to
read
we
all
patronises
the
house
an
it
my
opinion
if
it
was
twice
as
big
as
it
is
we
fill
it
i
would
board
as
well
as
sleep
in
it
myself
for
it
full
o
conveniences
sitch
as
lockers
to
putt
our
things
in
an
baths
and
what
not
besides
all
the
other
things
i
mentioned
but
the
want
o
drink
staggers
me
i
git
along
without
a
drop
o
drink
miles
thought
that
his
nautical
friend
appeared
to
be
unable
to
get
along
without
a
good
many
drops
of
drink
but
he
was
too
polite
to
say
so
man
alive
continued
jack
molloy
striking
his
huge
fist
on
his
thigh
with
emphasis
it
a
wonderful
place
is
this
an
it
a
lively
place
too
why
a
fellow
hanged
in
one
o
the
bunks
overhead
not
long
ago
you
do
mean
that
exclaimed
miles
rather
shocked
in
course
i
does
but
they
heard
gaspin
an
cut
him
down
in
time
to
save
him
it
was
drink
they
say
as
made
him
do
it
and
they
got
him
to
sign
the
pledge
arterwards
i
believe
he
kep
it
too
leastwise
i
know
many
a
hard
drinker
as
have
bin
indooced
to
give
it
up
and
stuck
to
it
all
through
comin
here
to
have
a
snooze
in
a
comfortable
hunk
they
give
the
bunks
names
cubicles
they
calls
in
the
lump
separately
there
the
goodenough
cot
an
the
nellie
cot
an
the
cot
so
called
it
hai
got
a
to
let
in
the
daylight
at
all
and
the
rough
the
what
billy
rough
arter
the
ship
o
that
name
you
know
oh
you
mean
the
well
young
man
an
did
i
the
rough
then
there
the
but
what
your
hurry
said
the
seaman
as
miles
rose
it
getting
late
now
friend
if
i
to
find
another
lodging
i
must
be
off
doubtless
i
find
some
respectable
house
to
take
me
in
for
the
night
miles
suppressed
a
yawn
as
he
put
on
his
cap
i
do
believe
you
will
returned
molloy
also
rising
and
giving
full
vent
to
a
sympathetic
and
vociferous
yawn
a
young
feller
insists
on
havin
his
way
it
best
to
give
him
plenty
of
cable
and
let
him
swing
he
sure
to
find
out
his
mistake
by
experience
but
look
ye
here
miles
i
took
a
fancy
to
you
an
be
sorry
to
think
you
was
in
difficulties
if
he
continued
thrusting
a
hand
into
his
and
bringing
up
therefrom
a
mass
of
mixed
gold
silver
and
copper
if
you
do
objec
to
accep
of
a
loan
of
thank
you
no
my
friend
it
is
very
kind
of
you
said
miles
quickly
but
i
have
quite
enough
for
present
necessities
so
all
right
returned
the
sailor
thrusting
the
money
back
into
his
pocket
but
if
you
should
ever
want
a
jaw
with
jack
molloy
while
you
in
this
here
port
you
only
got
to
hail
him
at
the
an
if
he
should
happen
to
be
out
they
always
can
tell
you
where
he
cruisin
an
luck
go
wi
ye
another
tremendous
yawn
finished
the
speech
and
next
moment
miles
found
himself
in
the
street
oppressed
with
a
strange
and
miserable
sensation
which
he
had
never
before
experienced
indeed
he
had
to
lean
against
the
house
for
a
few
minutes
after
coming
out
into
the
fresh
air
and
felt
as
if
the
power
of
connected
thought
was
leaving
him
he
was
aroused
from
this
condition
by
the
flashing
of
a
light
in
his
eyes
opening
them
wide
he
beheld
a
policeman
looking
at
him
earnestly
now
then
young
fellow
said
the
guardian
of
the
night
think
you
can
take
care
of
yourself
oh
yes
quite
well
it
only
a
giddy
feeling
that
came
over
me
all
right
said
miles
rousing
himself
and
passing
on
he
staggered
slightly
however
and
a
short
humph
from
the
policeman
showed
that
he
believed
the
youth
to
be
something
more
than
giddy
ashamed
to
be
even
unjustly
supposed
to
be
intoxicated
miles
hurried
away
wondering
very
much
what
could
be
the
matter
with
him
for
he
had
not
tasted
a
drop
of
strong
drink
except
the
of
beer
he
had
swallowed
before
molloy
chanced
to
knock
it
out
of
his
hand
suddenly
he
remembered
that
the
sailor
had
said
the
beer
was
drugged
if
he
could
have
asked
the
barman
who
had
served
him
that
worthy
could
have
told
him
that
this
was
true
that
the
whole
glassful
if
swallowed
would
ere
long
have
rendered
him
insensible
and
that
what
he
had
already
taken
was
enough
to
do
him
considerable
damage
as
he
walked
onward
he
became
rapidly
worse
the
people
and
the
streets
seemed
to
swim
before
him
an
intense
desire
to
sleep
overpowered
every
other
feeling
and
at
last
turning
into
a
dark
entry
he
lay
down
and
pillowed
his
head
on
a
here
he
was
found
by
a
policeman
a
stretcher
was
fetched
and
he
was
conveyed
to
the
station
as
drunk
and
incapable
when
brought
before
the
inspector
the
following
morning
shame
and
reckless
despair
were
the
tenants
of
his
breast
those
tenants
were
not
expelled
but
rather
confirmed
in
possession
when
the
inspector
after
numerous
questions
to
which
miles
returned
vague
unsatisfactory
replies
adopted
the
role
of
the
faithful
friend
and
gave
him
a
great
deal
of
paternal
advice
especially
with
reference
to
the
avoidance
of
strong
drink
and
bad
companions
miles
had
the
wisdom
however
to
conceal
his
feelings
and
to
take
the
reproof
and
advice
in
good
part
afterwards
on
being
set
free
he
met
a
recruiting
sergeant
who
regarding
him
as
a
suitable
subject
for
the
service
of
her
majesty
immediately
laid
siege
to
him
in
his
then
state
of
mind
the
siege
was
an
easy
one
in
short
he
capitulated
at
once
and
entered
the
queen
service
under
the
name
of
john
miles
we
need
scarcely
say
that
his
heart
misgave
him
that
his
conscience
condemned
him
and
that
do
what
he
would
he
could
not
shut
out
the
fact
that
his
taking
so
hasty
and
irrevocable
a
step
was
a
poor
return
for
all
the
care
and
anxiety
of
his
parents
in
years
gone
by
but
as
we
have
said
or
hinted
miles
was
one
of
those
youths
who
when
they
have
once
made
up
their
minds
to
a
certain
course
of
action
fancy
that
they
are
bound
to
pursue
it
to
the
end
hence
it
was
that
he
gave
his
name
as
john
miles
instead
of
miles
milton
so
that
he
might
baffle
any
inquiries
as
to
what
had
become
of
him
once
enlisted
he
soon
began
to
realise
the
fact
that
he
was
no
longer
a
free
agent
at
least
not
in
the
sense
in
which
he
had
been
so
up
to
that
period
of
his
life
constant
drill
was
the
order
of
the
day
for
some
weeks
for
there
was
a
demand
for
more
troops
for
egypt
at
the
time
and
regiments
were
being
made
up
to
their
full
strength
as
fast
as
possible
during
this
period
miles
saw
little
of
his
companions
in
arms
personally
save
that
group
of
recruits
who
were
being
licked
into
shape
along
with
him
at
first
he
was
disappointed
with
these
for
most
of
them
were
shy
unlettered
men
some
raw
lads
from
the
country
and
others
men
who
seemed
to
have
been
loafers
before
joining
and
were
by
no
means
attractive
the
however
was
a
good
though
stern
man
and
soon
recognised
the
differences
in
character
aptitude
and
willingness
among
his
raw
recruits
this
man
whose
name
was
hardy
made
a
powerful
impression
on
our
hero
from
the
first
there
was
something
so
quiet
and
even
gentle
about
him
in
spite
of
his
firm
and
inflexible
demands
in
regard
to
the
matters
of
drill
and
duty
to
please
this
man
miles
gave
himself
heart
and
soul
to
his
work
and
was
soon
so
efficient
as
to
be
allowed
to
join
the
regiment
and
here
he
found
to
his
surprise
and
satisfaction
that
the
sergeant
and
young
soldier
with
whom
he
had
travelled
to
portsmouth
were
members
of
the
company
to
which
he
was
attached
as
we
have
said
miles
had
taken
a
great
fancy
at
first
sight
to
the
young
private
whose
name
was
william
armstrong
our
hero
was
of
an
affectionate
disposition
and
would
have
allowed
his
warm
feelings
to
expend
themselves
on
a
dog
rather
than
have
denied
them
free
play
no
wonder
then
that
he
was
attracted
by
the
handsome
manly
countenance
and
deferential
manner
of
armstrong
who
although
an
uneducated
youth
and
reared
in
the
lower
ranks
of
life
was
gifted
with
those
qualities
of
the
true
gentleman
which
mere
social
position
can
neither
bestow
nor
take
away
his
intellect
also
was
of
that
active
and
vigorous
fibre
which
can
not
be
entirely
repressed
by
the
want
of
scholastic
training
the
affection
was
mutual
for
the
contrasts
and
similarities
of
the
two
men
were
alike
calculated
to
draw
them
together
both
were
tall
broad
erect
and
soldierly
yet
withal
modest
as
well
in
demeanour
as
in
feeling
and
so
exactly
like
to
each
other
in
size
and
figure
and
in
the
quiet
gravity
of
their
expressions
that
they
might
well
have
been
taken
for
twin
brothers
when
in
uniform
the
two
strode
along
the
streets
of
portsmouth
people
were
apt
to
turn
and
look
at
them
and
think
no
doubt
that
with
many
such
men
in
the
british
army
it
would
go
hard
with
the
foes
of
old
england
the
bond
of
union
was
still
further
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
while
the
comparatively
learned
miles
was
enthusiastic
and
communicative
the
unlettered
armstrong
was
inquisitive
and
receptive
fond
of
prying
into
the
nature
of
things
and
always
ready
as
well
as
competent
to
discuss
not
merely
to
observe
the
distinction
good
reader
discussion
means
the
shaking
of
any
subject
into
its
component
parts
with
a
desire
to
understand
it
argument
has
come
very
much
to
signify
the
enravelment
of
any
subject
with
a
view
to
the
confusion
and
conquest
of
an
opponent
both
young
men
abhorred
the
latter
and
liked
the
former
hence
much
of
their
harmony
and
friendship
will
you
come
with
me
up
town
said
armstrong
to
miles
one
day
as
he
was
about
to
quit
the
i
going
to
see
if
there
any
news
of
my
emmy
i
did
not
know
you
expected
her
said
miles
come
along
i
ready
i
do
expect
her
yet
returned
armstrong
as
they
left
the
barracks
i
only
look
for
a
letter
because
it
was
on
wednesday
that
i
wrote
telling
her
of
my
going
to
egypt
and
she
can
scarce
have
had
time
to
get
ready
to
come
down
poor
girl
in
fact
i
am
going
to
engage
a
room
for
her
by
the
way
i
heard
this
morning
that
there
to
be
another
draft
for
egypt
so
you
have
a
chance
to
go
i
rejoiced
to
hear
it
returned
miles
for
to
say
the
truth
i
had
been
growing
envious
of
your
good
fortune
in
being
ordered
on
active
service
hooroo
armstrong
where
away
now
cried
an
unmistakably
irish
voice
as
a
smart
little
soldier
crossed
the
street
to
them
and
was
introduced
to
miles
as
corporal
flynn
belonging
to
another
company
in
his
own
regiment
my
blissin
on
ye
miles
john
is
it
yes
john
replied
our
hero
much
amused
at
the
address
of
the
little
corporal
well
john
miles
he
said
i
do
know
whether
ye
laugh
or
cry
whin
i
tell
ye
that
you
likely
be
warned
this
evenin
for
the
draft
that
goin
to
aigypt
i
certainly
wo
cry
returned
miles
with
a
laugh
yet
the
news
brought
a
sudden
feeling
into
his
breast
which
was
strongly
allied
to
the
opposite
of
laughter
for
the
thought
of
parting
from
father
and
mother
without
bidding
them
farewell
fell
upon
his
spirit
with
crushing
weight
but
like
too
many
men
who
know
they
are
about
to
do
wrong
miles
hardened
his
heart
with
the
delusive
argument
that
having
fairly
taken
the
step
it
was
impossible
for
him
now
to
retrace
it
he
knew
at
least
he
thought
that
there
was
still
the
possibility
of
being
bought
off
and
that
his
stern
father
would
only
be
too
glad
to
help
him
he
also
knew
that
at
least
he
had
time
to
write
and
let
them
know
his
circumstances
so
that
they
might
run
down
to
portsmouth
and
bid
him
but
he
had
taken
the
bit
in
his
teeth
and
now
he
resolved
to
abide
the
consequences
turning
from
his
companions
while
they
conversed
he
looked
into
a
your
chum
in
the
blues
said
the
lively
corporal
in
a
lower
voice
young
fellows
are
often
in
that
state
after
joining
ai
they
returned
armstrong
true
for
ye
an
more
shame
to
them
whin
they
ought
to
be
as
proud
as
paycocks
at
wearin
her
gracious
majesty
uniform
but
good
luck
to
i
must
be
off
for
i
bound
for
aigypt
mesilf
i
am
glad
that
i
shall
have
the
chance
of
seeing
your
wife
for
been
much
interested
in
her
since
your
friend
sergeant
gilroy
told
me
about
her
said
miles
as
they
resumed
their
walk
surely
it
is
hard
of
them
to
refuse
to
let
her
go
with
the
regiment
well
it
hard
returned
the
young
soldier
but
after
all
i
can
not
find
fault
with
the
powers
that
be
for
i
married
with
my
eyes
open
i
knew
the
rule
that
those
who
marry
without
leave
must
leave
their
wives
at
home
for
only
a
certain
number
of
families
can
go
abroad
with
a
regiment
and
that
only
in
it
might
have
been
well
continued
armstrong
slowly
while
a
sad
expression
clouded
his
face
for
a
few
moments
if
i
had
waited
and
many
a
time
has
my
conscience
smitten
me
for
my
haste
but
what
could
i
do
emmy
most
unaccountably
fell
in
love
wi
me
for
i
do
think
that
the
greatest
earthly
blessing
that
can
be
given
to
mortal
man
is
the
love
of
a
gentle
girl
the
wealth
of
the
indies
can
not
purchase
that
and
nothing
else
in
life
can
supply
the
want
of
it
can
you
wonder
that
i
grasped
the
treasure
when
within
my
reach
i
certainly
can
not
and
as
certainly
i
do
not
blame
you
returned
the
sympathetic
miles
of
course
i
fell
in
love
with
emmy
continued
the
soldier
with
a
slightly
confused
look
i
could
no
more
help
that
than
i
could
help
growing
up
could
i
certainly
not
said
miles
well
you
see
continued
his
friend
as
the
affair
was
arranged
in
heaven
according
to
general
belief
what
was
i
that
i
should
resist
you
see
emmy
father
who
a
farmer
was
willing
and
we
never
gave
a
thought
to
egypt
or
the
war
at
the
time
she
will
be
well
looked
after
while
i
away
and
i
send
her
every
penny
of
my
pay
that
i
can
spare
but
he
stopped
abruptly
and
miles
respecting
his
feelings
remarked
by
way
of
changing
the
subject
that
the
pay
of
a
private
soldier
being
so
small
very
little
could
be
saved
out
of
that
not
much
assented
his
comrade
but
little
as
it
is
we
can
increase
it
in
various
ways
for
one
thing
i
have
given
up
smoking
that
will
save
a
little
though
to
say
truth
i
have
never
expended
much
on
baccy
then
i
have
joined
miss
robinson
temperance
band
strange
how
often
that
lady
name
has
been
in
my
ears
since
i
came
to
portsmouth
said
miles
not
so
strange
after
all
returned
armstrong
when
one
reflects
that
she
has
been
the
means
of
almost
changing
the
character
of
the
town
within
the
last
few
years
as
far
at
least
as
concerns
the
condition
of
soldiers
as
well
as
many
of
the
poorer
classes
among
its
inhabitants
so
sergeant
gilroy
tells
me
as
some
of
the
information
given
by
sergeant
gilroy
to
the
young
soldier
may
be
interesting
to
many
readers
we
quote
a
few
of
his
own
words
why
some
years
ago
he
said
the
soldiers
wives
mothers
and
sisters
who
came
down
here
to
see
the
poor
fellows
set
sail
for
foreign
parts
found
it
almost
impossible
to
obtain
lodgings
except
in
which
no
respectable
woman
could
enter
some
poor
women
even
preferred
to
spend
a
winter
night
under
railway
arches
or
some
such
shelter
rather
than
enter
these
places
and
soldiers
out
of
barracks
had
nowhere
else
to
go
to
for
amusement
while
sailors
on
leave
had
to
spend
their
nights
in
them
or
walk
the
streets
now
all
that
is
changed
the
soldiers
institute
supplies
beds
and
furnishes
board
and
lodging
to
our
sisters
and
wives
at
the
lowest
possible
rates
besides
where
we
can
meet
our
friends
a
splendid
where
we
find
newspapers
and
magazines
and
can
write
our
letters
if
we
like
in
peace
and
quiet
a
bar
where
tea
and
coffee
bread
and
butter
buns
etcetera
can
be
had
at
all
reasonable
hours
for
a
mere
trifle
a
coffee
and
smoking
room
opening
out
of
which
are
two
and
beyond
these
a
garden
where
we
can
get
on
the
flat
roof
of
a
house
and
watch
the
arrival
and
departure
of
shipping
there
is
a
small
charge
to
which
pays
all
expenses
of
the
tables
so
that
not
a
penny
of
the
institute
funds
is
spent
on
the
games
of
course
no
gambling
is
allowed
in
any
of
miss
institutes
then
there
are
rooms
and
women
and
a
lending
library
and
bathrooms
and
a
great
hall
big
enough
to
hold
a
thousand
people
where
there
are
held
temperance
meetings
lectures
with
dissolving
views
entertainments
and
and
sunday
services
no
wonder
that
with
such
an
agency
at
work
for
the
glory
of
god
and
the
good
of
men
portsmouth
is
almost
a
new
place
indeed
although
miss
robinson
met
with
powerful
opposition
at
first
from
the
powers
that
be
her
institute
is
now
heartily
recognised
and
encouraged
in
every
way
at
the
horse
guards
indeed
it
has
recently
been
visited
by
the
prince
of
wales
and
the
duke
of
cambridge
and
highly
approved
of
by
these
and
other
grandees
while
the
two
soldiers
were
chatting
about
the
past
and
present
of
the
institute
they
arrived
at
its
door
here
we
are
come
into
the
miles
while
i
make
inquiry
about
my
letters
they
entered
the
house
as
he
spoke
the
is
on
the
right
of
the
passage
armstrong
opened
the
door
and
looked
in
but
instead
of
advancing
he
stood
transfixed
gazing
before
him
as
though
he
had
seen
a
spectre
for
there
in
front
of
the
fire
sat
a
beautiful
girl
with
golden
hair
and
blue
eyes
gazing
pensively
at
the
flickering
flames
miles
was
not
kept
long
in
suspense
as
to
who
she
was
emmy
oh
willie
these
were
exclamations
which
would
have
revealed
all
in
a
moment
even
though
emmy
had
not
sprung
up
and
rushed
into
willie
open
arms
how
she
ever
emerged
from
the
embrace
of
those
arms
with
unbroken
bones
is
a
mystery
which
can
not
be
solved
but
she
did
emerge
in
safety
and
with
some
confusion
on
observing
that
miles
had
witnessed
the
incident
with
admiring
gaze
never
mind
him
emmy
said
the
young
soldier
laughing
he
a
good
friend
a
comrade
shake
hands
with
him
the
action
and
the
ease
of
manner
with
which
emmy
obeyed
proved
that
grace
and
small
hands
are
not
altogether
dependent
on
rank
or
station
excuse
me
said
miles
after
a
few
words
of
salutation
i
go
and
have
a
look
at
the
library
so
saying
he
quitted
the
room
leaving
the
young
couple
alone
for
there
chanced
to
be
no
other
visitors
to
the
at
the
time
in
the
lobby
he
found
several
soldiers
and
a
couple
of
sailors
enjoying
coffee
at
the
bar
and
was
about
to
join
them
when
a
man
came
forward
whose
dress
was
that
of
a
civilian
though
his
bearing
proclaimed
him
a
soldier
hallo
brown
exclaimed
one
of
the
soldiers
d
know
that
a
has
just
come
in
know
it
of
course
i
do
you
may
trust
the
people
of
this
house
to
be
first
in
hearing
such
news
mr
tufnell
told
me
of
it
i
just
going
down
to
the
jetty
to
boil
the
kettle
for
them
as
he
spoke
two
ladies
of
the
institute
descended
the
broad
staircase
each
with
a
basket
on
her
arm
they
entered
into
conversation
for
a
few
minutes
with
the
soldiers
at
the
bar
and
it
was
abundantly
evident
to
miles
from
the
kindly
tone
of
the
former
and
the
respectful
air
of
the
latter
that
they
were
familiar
acquaintances
and
on
the
best
of
terms
are
you
all
ready
brown
asked
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
civilian
whom
we
have
already
mentioned
all
ready
miss
a
man
has
already
gone
to
order
the
bread
and
butter
and
light
the
fire
i
hear
the
vessel
is
crowded
so
we
may
expect
a
full
house
miles
pricked
up
his
ears
on
hearing
this
and
when
brown
went
out
leaving
the
two
ladies
to
finish
their
conversation
with
the
soldiers
he
followed
him
pardon
me
he
said
on
overtaking
the
man
did
i
understand
correctly
that
a
has
just
arrived
right
said
brown
i
am
just
going
down
to
the
embarkation
jetty
to
get
coffee
ready
for
the
men
you
seem
to
have
joined
but
a
short
time
apparently
for
though
i
am
familiar
with
your
uniform
i
have
not
seen
yourself
before
true
it
is
not
long
since
i
joined
and
this
is
my
first
visit
to
the
institute
i
hope
it
wo
be
the
last
friend
returned
brown
heartily
every
soldier
is
welcome
there
and
for
the
matter
of
that
so
is
every
sailor
and
marine
i
have
heard
as
much
may
i
accompany
you
to
this
jetty
to
see
the
troops
arrive
and
this
coffee
business
that
you
speak
of
you
may
and
welcome
said
brown
leading
his
companion
through
the
town
in
the
direction
of
the
docks
and
chatting
as
they
walked
along
about
the
army
and
navy
about
his
own
experiences
in
the
former
and
about
the
condition
of
soldiers
at
the
present
time
as
contrasted
with
that
of
the
days
gone
by
chapter
four
the
embarkation
jetty
and
nipped
in
the
bud
bronzed
faces
under
white
helmets
crowded
the
ports
and
bulwarks
of
the
great
white
leviathan
of
the
deep
the
as
she
steamed
slowly
and
cautiously
up
to
the
embarkation
jetty
in
portsmouth
harbour
on
the
jetty
itself
a
few
anxious
wives
mothers
and
sisters
stood
eagerly
scanning
the
sea
of
faces
in
the
almost
hopeless
endeavour
to
distinguish
those
for
which
they
sought
yet
ever
and
anon
an
exclamation
on
the
jetty
and
an
answering
wave
of
an
arm
on
the
told
that
some
at
least
of
the
anxious
ones
had
been
successful
in
the
search
do
they
look
remarked
miles
to
his
companion
sure
it
more
like
they
are
answered
a
voice
at
his
side
brown
had
gone
to
the
shed
to
prepare
his
coffee
and
bread
against
the
landing
of
the
troops
and
a
stout
irishwoman
had
taken
his
place
close
to
her
stood
the
two
ladies
from
the
institute
with
baskets
on
their
arms
you
are
right
returned
miles
with
a
smile
they
look
like
men
who
have
seen
service
is
your
husband
among
them
faix
i
be
sorprised
if
he
returned
the
woman
for
i
left
him
in
owld
ireland
in
the
only
landed
property
he
iver
held
in
this
world
six
futt
by
two
an
five

been
in
possession
six
years
now
an
it
would
be
aisy
to
drive
him
out
o
that
anyhow
no
it
my
son
terence
i
come
to
look
afther
och
there
he
is
look
look
that
him
close
by
the
funnel
do
ye
see
blissins
on
his
face
hooroo
terence
terence
flynn
do
ye
recognise
yer
owld
mother
sure
an
he
does
though
we
have
met
for
tin
year
my
has
he
got
the
hair
on
his
lips
too
an
his
cheeks
are
like
my
darlint
as
the
enthusiastic
mother
spoke
in
the
tones
of
a
public
orator
there
was
a
general
laugh
among
those
who
were
nearest
to
her
but
she
was
forgotten
immediately
for
all
were
too
deeply
intent
on
their
own
interests
to
pay
much
regard
to
each
other
just
then
the
great
vessel
was
slow
in
getting
alongside
and
making
fast
to
the
jetty
slow
at
least
in
the
estimation
of
the
impatient
for
although
she
might
leap
and
career
grandly
in
wanton
playfulness
while
on
her
native
billows
in
port
a
careless
touch
from
her
ponderous
sides
would
have
crushed
part
of
the
jetty
into
fragments
miles
therefore
had
ample
time
to
look
about
him
at
the
various
groups
around
one
young
woman
specially
attracted
his
attention
for
she
stood
apart
from
every
one
and
seemed
scarcely
able
to
stand
because
of
weakness
she
was
young
and
her
face
which
was
deadly
pale
contrasted
strongly
with
her
glossy
hair
and
the
character
of
her
dress
denoted
extreme
poverty
the
ladies
from
the
institute
had
also
observed
this
poor
girl
and
one
of
them
going
to
her
side
quietly
addressed
her
miles
from
the
position
in
which
he
stood
could
not
avoid
overhearing
what
was
said
yes
miss
i
expect
my
husband
said
the
woman
in
answer
to
a
question
he
coming
home
on
i
had
a
letter
from
him
a
good
while
ago
saying
he
was
coming
home
in
the
i
hope
you
will
find
that
the
sea
air
has
done
him
good
said
the
lady
in
that
tone
of
unobtrusive
sympathy
which
is
so
powerfully
attractive
especially
to
those
who
are
in
trouble
a
sea
voyage
frequently
has
a
wonderful
effect
in
restoring
invalids
what
is
his
name
martin
fred
martin
he
a
corporal
now
you
have
not
recognised
him
yet
i
suppose
not
yet
miss
answered
mrs
martin
with
an
anxious
look
and
shivering
slightly
as
she
drew
a
thin
worn
shawl
of
many
patches
closer
round
her
shoulders
but
he
would
expect
me
to
meet
him
you
see
knowing
that
i
so
poor
and
live
far
from
portsmouth
but
i
was
so
anxious
you
see
miss
that
our
kind
vicar
gave
me
enough
money
to
come
down
where
did
you
spend
the
night
asked
the
lady
quickly
the
poor
woman
hesitated
and
at
last
said
she
had
spent
the
night
walking
about
the
streets
you
see
miss
she
explained
apologetically
i
did
know
a
soul
in
the
town
and
i
could
to
go
into
any
o
the
besides
i
had
no
money
for
the
journey
down
took
nearly
all
of
it
oh
i
am
so
sorry
that
you
did
know
of
our
institute
said
the
lady
with
much
sympathy
in
voice
and
look
for
we
provide
accommodation
for
soldiers
wives
who
come
like
you
to
meet
their
husbands
returning
from
abroad
and
we
charge
little
or
even
nothing
if
they
are
too
poor
to
pay
indeed
miss
i
wish
i
had
known
of
it
but
in
the
morning
i
had
the
luck
to
meet
a
policeman
who
directed
me
to
a
in
a
place
called
nobbs
lane
you
not
know
it
miss
for
it
in
a
very
poor
part
o
the
town
where
i
got
a
breakfast
of
as
much
hot
and
bread
as
i
could
eat
for
an
had
a
good
rest
beside
the
fire
too
they
told
me
it
was
kept
by
a
miss
robinson
god
bless
her
whoever
she
is
for
i
do
believe
i
should
have
been
dead
by
now
if
i
had
got
the
rest
and
the
breakfast
the
woman
shivered
again
as
she
spoke
and
drew
the
thin
shawl
still
closer
for
a
sharp
east
wind
was
blowing
over
the
jetty
at
the
time
come
with
me
you
are
cold
i
know
nobbs
lane
well
we
have
a
shed
and
fire
here
on
the
jetty
to
shelter
people
while
waiting
there
you
need
not
fear
to
miss
your
husband
for
the
men
wo
land
for
a
long
time
yet
may
i
follow
you
madam
said
miles
stepping
forward
and
touching
his
cap
in
what
he
supposed
to
be
the
deferential
manner
of
a
private
soldier
i
am
interested
in
your
work
and
would
like
to
see
the
shed
you
speak
of
the
lady
looked
up
quickly
at
the
tall
young
soldier
who
thus
addressed
her
i
saw
you
in
the
lobby
of
the
institute
this
morning
did
i
not
you
did
madam
i
was
waiting
for
a
friend
who
is
a
frequenter
of
the
institute
one
of
your
own
people
brought
me
down
here
to
see
the
arrival
of
the
and
the
but
i
have
lost
him
in
the
crowd
and
know
not
where
the
shed
is
here
it
is
returned
the
lady
pointing
to
an
iron
structure
just
behind
them
you
will
find
mr
brown
there
busy
with
the
coffee
and
that
small
shed
beside
it
is
the
you
are
welcome
to
inspect
all
our
buildings
at
any
time
so
saying
the
lady
led
mrs
martin
into
the
shed
last
referred
to
and
miles
followed
her
there
was
a
small
stove
in
the
solitary
iron
room
of
which
the
shed
consisted
which
diffused
a
genial
warmth
around
several
wives
and
female
relatives
were
seated
beside
it
engaged
in
quieting
refractory
infants
or
fitting
a
few
woollen
garments
on
children
of
various
ages
these
garments
had
been
brought
from
the
institute
chiefly
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
the
wives
and
children
returning
from
warmer
climes
to
england
and
one
of
them
a
thick
knitted
shawl
was
immediately
presented
to
mrs
martin
as
a
gift
and
placed
round
her
shoulders
by
the
lady
own
hands
you
are
kind
miss
she
said
an
unbidden
tear
rolling
down
her
cheek
as
she
surveyed
the
garment
and
folded
it
over
her
breast
have
you
any
children
asked
the
lady
none
we
had
one
a
dear
baby
boy
answered
the
young
wife
sadly
born
after
his
father
left
england
god
took
him
home
when
he
was
two
years
old
his
father
never
saw
him
but
we
shall
all
meet
again
she
added
brightly
in
the
better
land
ah
it
makes
me
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
god
took
him
only
the
spirit
of
jesus
could
make
you
regard
heaven
as
the
home
where
you
are
all
to
meet
again
now
i
would
advise
you
to
sit
here
and
keep
warm
till
i
go
and
make
inquiry
about
your
husband
it
is
quite
possible
you
know
that
he
may
be
in
the
sick
bay
and
they
wo
let
any
one
on
board
till
the
vessel
is
made
fast
you
are
quite
sure
i
suppose
that
it
was
the
in
which
your
husband
said
he
was
coming
yes
quite
sure
the
lady
had
asked
the
question
because
a
vague
fear
possessed
her
regarding
the
cause
of
the
soldier
not
having
been
seen
looking
eagerly
over
the
side
like
the
other
men
hurrying
from
the
shed
with
her
basket
on
her
arm
she
made
for
the
gangway
which
had
just
been
placed
in
position
she
was
accompanied
by
her
companion
also
carrying
her
basket
miles
took
the
liberty
of
following
them
closely
but
not
obviously
for
he
formed
only
one
of
a
stream
of
men
and
women
who
pushed
on
board
the
instant
that
permission
was
given
while
one
of
the
ladies
went
in
search
of
one
of
the
chief
officers
the
other
quietly
and
unobtrusively
advanced
among
the
returning
warriors
and
opening
her
basket
drew
therefrom
and
offered
to
each
soldier
an
envelope
containing
one
or
two
booklets
and
texts
and
a
hearty
invitation
to
make
free
use
of
the
soldiers
institute
during
their
stay
in
portsmouth
a
most
bewildering
scene
was
presented
on
the
deck
of
that
great
white
vessel
there
were
hundreds
of
soldiers
in
her
returning
home
after
longer
or
shorter
absences
in
china
india
the
cape
and
other
parts
of
the
earth
some
were
stalwart
and
bronzed
by
the
southern
sun
others
were
gaunt
weak
and
cadaverous
from
the
effect
of
sickness
exposure
or
wounds
but
all
were
more
or
less
excited
at
having
once
again
set
eyes
on
old
england
and
at
the
near
prospect
of
once
more
embracing
wives
mothers
and
sweethearts
and
meeting
with
old
friends
the
continual
noise
of
manly
voices
hailing
exclaiming
chaffing
or
conversing
and
the
general
babel
of
sounds
is
indescribable
to
miles
milton
who
had
never
before
even
imagined
anything
of
the
sort
it
seemed
more
like
a
vivid
dream
than
a
reality
he
became
so
bewildered
with
trying
to
attend
to
everything
at
once
that
he
lost
sight
of
the
shorter
of
the
ladies
whom
he
was
following
but
pushing
ahead
soon
found
her
again
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
old
friends
though
still
young
soldiers
who
had
known
the
institute
before
leaving
for
foreign
service
and
were
eagerly
inquiring
after
the
health
of
miss
robinson
and
tufnell
the
manager
and
others
during
his
progress
through
this
bustling
scene
miles
observed
that
the
soldiers
invariably
received
the
gifts
from
the
lady
with
respect
and
many
of
them
with
hearty
expressions
of
thanks
while
a
few
stopped
her
to
speak
about
the
contents
of
the
envelopes
so
numerous
were
the
men
that
the
work
had
to
be
done
with
celerity
but
the
visitor
was
experienced
while
wasting
no
time
in
useless
delay
she
never
hurried
her
movements
or
refused
to
stop
and
speak
or
forced
her
way
through
the
moving
throng
almost
unobserved
save
by
the
men
who
chanced
to
be
next
to
her
she
glided
in
and
out
amongst
them
like
a
spirit
of
light
which
in
the
highest
sense
she
was
intent
on
her
beneficent
mission
her
sole
aim
was
to
save
the
men
from
the
tremendous
dangers
that
awaited
them
on
landing
in
portsmouth
and
bring
them
under
christian
influence
those
dangers
may
be
imagined
when
it
is
told
that
soldiers
returning
from
abroad
are
often
in
possession
of
large
sums
of
money
and
that
harpies
of
all
kinds
are
eagerly
waiting
to
plunder
them
on
their
arrival
on
one
occasion
a
regiment
came
home
and
in
a
few
days
squandered
three
thousand
pounds
in
portsmouth
much
more
might
be
said
on
this
point
but
enough
has
been
indicated
to
move
thoughtful
minds
and
our
story
waits
suddenly
the
attention
of
miles
and
every
one
near
him
was
attracted
by
the
loud
hibernian
yell
of
a
female
voice
exclaiming
oh
terence
me
darlin
son
here
ye
are
an
is
it
yersilf
purtier
a
long
way
than
the
day
ye
left
me
an
niver
so
much
as
a
scratch
on
yer
face
for
all
the
wars
ye
bin
in
bad
luck
to
thim
need
we
say
that
this
was
mrs
flynn
in
her
anxiety
to
meet
her
son
she
had
run
against
innumerable
men
and
women
who
remonstrated
with
her
variously
according
to
temperament
without
however
the
slightest
effect
her
wild
career
was
not
checked
until
she
had
flung
herself
into
the
arms
of
a
tall
stalwart
trooper
with
drooping
moustache
who
would
have
done
credit
to
any
nationality
under
the
sun
and
whose
enthusiasm
at
the
happy
meeting
with
his
mother
was
almost
as
demonstrative
as
her
own
but
more
dignified
others
there
were
however
whose
case
was
very
different
one
who
came
there
to
meet
the
strong
healthy
man
to
whom
she
had
said
at
the
same
spot
several
years
before
received
him
back
a
worn
and
wasted
invalid
upright
still
with
the
martial
air
of
discipline
but
feeble
and
with
something
like
the
stamp
of
death
upon
his
brow
another
woman
found
her
son
strong
indeed
and
healthy
as
of
yore
but
with
an
empty
sleeve
where
his
right
arm
should
have
been
his
days
of
warfare
over
before
his
earthly
sun
had
reached
the
zenith
whilst
miles
was
taking
note
of
these
things
and
moralising
in
spite
of
his
distaste
just
then
to
that
phase
of
mental
occupation
the
other
lady
of
the
institute
appeared
and
spoke
hurriedly
to
her
companion
go
she
said
tell
mrs
martin
that
her
husband
is
on
board
the
let
tufnell
if
he
is
at
the
shed
or
our
missionary
take
her
up
to
the
institute
without
delay
let
them
take
this
note
to
miss
robinson
at
the
same
time
the
younger
lady
looked
inquiringly
at
her
companion
but
the
latter
pushed
on
hurriedly
and
was
soon
lost
in
the
crowd
so
she
went
at
once
on
shore
to
obey
her
instructions
being
thus
left
to
look
after
himself
miles
went
about
gazing
at
the
varied
interesting
and
curious
scenes
that
the
vessel
presented
no
one
took
any
notice
of
him
for
he
was
only
one
soldier
among
hundreds
and
so
many
people
from
the
shore
had
been
admitted
by
that
time
that
strange
faces
attracted
no
attention
we
have
referred
chiefly
to
soldiers
friends
but
these
after
all
formed
a
small
minority
of
the
visitors
many
of
whom
were
tradesmen
of
the
town
tailors
shoemakers
and
vendors
of
fancy
articles
who
had
come
down
with
their
wares
to
tempt
the
returning
voyagers
to
part
with
their
superfluous
cash
even
in
the
midst
of
all
the
pushing
and
confusion
one
man
was
seen
trying
on
a
pair
of
boots
near
to
him
was
a
sailor
carefully
inspecting
a
tailor
book
of
patterns
with
a
view
to
clothes
while
another
more
prompt
in
action
was
already
being
measured
for
a
suit
of
the
same
descending
to
the
our
hero
found
that
the
confusion
and
noise
there
were
naturally
greater
the
space
being
more
limited
and
the
noise
confined
there
was
the
addition
of
bad
air
and
disagreeable
smells
here
and
miles
could
not
help
reflecting
on
the
prospect
before
him
of
long
voyages
under
cramped
circumstances
in
the
midst
of
similar
surroundings
but
being
young
and
enthusiastic
he
whispered
to
himself
that
he
was
not
particular
and
was
ready
to
rough
it
in
his
country
cause
in
a
remarkably
dark
region
to
which
he
penetrated
he
found
himself
in
the
women
quarters
the
disagreeables
of
which
were
increased
by
the
cries
of
discontented
children
and
the
yells
of
inconsolable
infants
some
of
whom
had
first
seen
the
light
of
this
world
in
the
sad
twilight
of
shrinking
from
that
locality
miles
pursued
his
investigations
and
gradually
became
aware
that
sundry
parrots
and
other
pets
which
the
soldiers
and
sailors
had
brought
home
were
adding
their
notes
of
discord
to
the
chorus
of
sounds
while
he
was
looking
at
and
attempting
to
pat
a
small
monkey
which
received
his
advances
with
looks
of
astonished
indignation
he
became
conscious
of
the
fact
that
a
number
of
eyes
were
looking
down
on
him
through
a
crevice
at
the
top
of
a
partition
close
to
his
side
who
are
these
he
asked
of
a
sailor
who
stood
near
him
why
them
are
the
men
i
suppose
you
mean
prisoners
yes
that
about
it
replied
the
tar
soldiers
as
has
committed
murder
or
suthin
o
that
sort
an
got
twenty
year
or
more
for
all
i
knows
the
other
fellers
further
on
there
in
chains
is
men
bin
an
done
suthin
or
other
not
quite
so
bad
i
suppose
miles
advanced
further
on
and
found
eight
men
seated
on
the
deck
and
leaning
against
the
bulkhead
if
his
attention
had
not
been
drawn
to
them
he
might
have
supposed
they
were
merely
resting
but
a
closer
glance
showed
that
they
were
all
chained
to
an
iron
bar
they
did
not
seem
very
different
from
the
other
men
around
them
save
that
they
were
most
of
them
stern
and
silent
a
powerful
feeling
of
compassion
rose
in
our
hero
breast
as
he
looked
at
these
moral
wrecks
of
humanity
for
their
characters
and
prospects
were
ruined
though
their
physique
was
not
much
impaired
it
seemed
to
him
such
an
awful
after
perhaps
long
years
of
absence
thus
in
the
midst
of
all
the
bustle
and
joy
of
meetings
and
of
pleasant
anticipations
to
be
waiting
there
for
the
arrival
of
the
and
looking
forward
to
years
of
imprisonment
instead
of
reunion
with
friends
and
kindred
at
sight
of
them
a
thought
sprang
irresistibly
into
our
hero
mind
this
is
the
result
of
his
conscience
was
uncomfortably
active
and
faithful
that
morning
somehow
it
pointed
out
to
him
that
was
a
long
ladder
that
the
chained
criminals
before
him
had
reached
the
foot
and
that
he
stood
on
the
topmost
rung
that
was
all
the
difference
between
them
and
himself
a
difference
of
degree
not
of
principle
pushing
his
way
a
little
closer
to
these
men
he
found
that
his
was
not
the
only
heart
that
pitied
them
his
friend
the
younger
lady
was
there
speaking
to
them
he
could
not
hear
what
she
said
for
the
noise
drowned
her
voice
but
her
earnest
eager
look
and
her
gesticulations
told
well
enough
that
she
was
pointing
them
to
the
saviour
of
sinners
with
what
effect
of
course
he
could
not
tell
but
it
was
evident
that
the
prisoners
at
least
gave
her
their
attention
leaving
her
thus
engaged
miles
continued
for
a
considerable
time
his
progress
through
the
ship
afterwards
he
observed
by
a
movement
among
the
men
that
a
detachment
was
about
to
land
indeed
he
found
that
some
of
the
soldiers
had
already
landed
and
were
making
their
way
to
the
following
these
quickly
to
the
same
place
he
found
that
innumerable
cups
of
hot
coffee
and
solid
slices
of
bread
and
butter
were
being
served
out
as
fast
as
they
could
be
filled
and
cut
a
large
hole
or
window
opened
in
the
side
of
the
shed
the
shutter
of
which
was
hinged
at
the
bottom
and
when
let
down
formed
a
convenient
counter
behind
this
counter
stood
the
two
ubiquitous
ladies
of
the
institute
acting
the
part
of
barmaids
as
if
to
the
manner
born
and
with
the
same
active
yet
modest
air
which
marked
all
their
proceedings
and
truly
their
post
was
no
sinecure
to
supply
the
demands
of
hundreds
of
hungry
and
thirsty
warriors
was
not
inside
the
shed
miles
found
his
friend
brown
busy
with
a
mighty
caldron
of
hot
water
numerous
packets
of
coffee
and
immense
quantities
of
sugar
and
preserved
milk
brown
was
the
the
ladies
were
the
distributing
pipes
if
we
may
say
so
and
although
the
fountain
produced
can
after
can
of
the
coveted
liquid
with
amazing
rapidity
and
with
a
prodigality
of
material
that
would
have
made
the
hair
of
a
private
housewife
stand
on
end
it
was
barely
possible
to
keep
pace
with
the
demand
at
a
large
table
one
of
the
missionaries
of
the
institute
cut
up
and
buttered
loaves
at
a
rate
which
gave
the
impression
that
he
was
a
conjurer
engaged
in
a
species
of
the
butter
however
troubled
him
for
the
weather
being
cold
it
was
hard
and
would
not
spread
easily
to
overcome
this
he
put
a
pound
or
so
of
it
on
a
plate
beside
the
to
soften
unfortunately
he
temporarily
forgot
it
and
on
afterwards
going
for
it
found
that
it
had
been
reduced
to
a
yellow
liquid
however
hungry
soldiers
rejoicing
in
the
fact
of
having
at
last
reached
home
are
not
particular
some
of
them
unaccustomed
no
doubt
to
be
served
by
ladies
asked
for
their
supply
deferentially
accepted
it
politely
and
drank
it
with
additional
appreciation
we
want
more
brown
said
one
of
the
ladies
glancing
back
over
her
shoulder
as
she
poured
out
the
last
drop
from
her
large
jug
and
more
buns
and
bread
please
here
you
are
miss
cried
brown
who
was
warm
by
that
time
in
spite
of
the
weather
as
he
bore
his
brimming
and
steaming
pitcher
to
the
window
or
hole
in
the
wall
and
replenished
the
jugs
the
buns
are
all
done
an
the
bread
wo
hold
out
long
but
i
sent
for
more
it
wo
be
long
i
see
we
shall
need
several
more
brews
he
added
as
he
turned
again
towards
the
inexhaustible
boiler
shall
i
assist
you
said
miles
stepping
into
the
shed
and
seizing
a
loaf
and
a
knife
thank
you
go
ahead
said
brown
put
another
lump
of
butter
near
the
fire
said
the
missionary
to
our
hero
not
too
close
i
melted
the
last
lump
altogether
a
cup
o
coffee
for
my
terence
an
wan
for
mesilf
my
dear
exclaimed
a
loud
voice
outside
there
was
no
mistaking
the
speaker
some
of
the
men
who
crowded
round
the
counter
laughed
others
partially
choked
when
the
strapping
terence
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
whist
mother
be
civil
do
ye
see
that
it
ladies
no
less
is
sarvin
of
us
please
can
i
some
coffee
asked
a
modest
soldier
wife
who
looked
pale
and
weary
after
the
long
voyage
with
three
children
to
look
after
a
cup
was
promptly
supplied
and
three
of
the
buns
stopped
the
mouths
of
her
clamorous
offspring
can
ye
give
me
a
cup
o
tea
demanded
another
soldier
wife
who
was
neither
so
polite
nor
so
young
as
the
previous
applicant
it
is
probable
that
the
ladies
did
not
observe
the
nature
of
her
demand
else
they
would
doubtless
have
explained
that
they
had
no
tea
but
a
cup
of
coffee
was
silently
handed
to
her
ah
this
is
this
is
she
said
smacking
her
lips
after
the
first
sip
a
mighty
difference
this
an
what
bin
used
to
in
the
ship
yes
indeed
assented
her
companion
whether
it
was
tea
she
had
been
accustomed
to
drink
on
board
the
we
can
not
tell
but
probably
she
was
correct
as
to
the
mighty
difference
it
may
be
that
the
beverages
supplied
in
foreign
lands
had
somewhat
damaged
the
power
of
discrimination
as
to
matters
of
taste
in
these
soldiers
wives
at
all
events
an
incident
which
occurred
about
the
same
time
justifies
this
belief
mr
miles
said
the
missionary
pausing
a
moment
to
wipe
his
brow
in
the
midst
of
his
labours
will
you
fetch
the
butter
now
miles
turned
to
obey
with
alacrity
with
too
much
alacrity
indeed
for
in
his
haste
he
knocked
the
plate
over
and
sent
the
lump
of
butter
into
the
last
prepared
brew
of
coffee
hallo
i
say
exclaimed
brown
in
consternation
more
coffee
brown
demanded
the
ladies
simultaneously
at
that
inauspicious
moment
yes
miss
i
i
coming
directly
cried
brown
do
be
quick
please
what
to
be
done
said
brown
making
futile
endeavours
to
fish
out
the
slippery
mass
with
the
shove
it
down
and
stir
it
well
about
suggested
miles
whether
conscience
was
inoperative
at
that
moment
we
know
not
but
brown
acted
on
the
suggestion
and
briskly
amalgamated
the
butter
with
the
coffee
while
the
crowd
at
the
politely
but
continuously
demanded
more
do
be
in
a
tom
cried
a
corporal
removing
his
pith
helmet
in
order
to
run
his
fingers
through
his
hair
it
a
state
things
now
to
what
it
was
a
few
years
ago
we
an
our
poor
wives
to
sit
for
hours
in
the
heat
or
cold
wet
or
dry
without
shelter
or
a
morsel
to
eat
or
a
drop
to
drink
till
we
got
away
up
town
to
the
well
this
civilisation
at
last
remarked
a
handsome
and
hearty
young
fellow
who
had
apparently
been
ignorant
of
the
treat
in
store
for
him
and
who
sauntered
up
to
the
shed
just
as
the
was
beginning
to
be
served
out
why
i
declare
it
chocolate
exclaimed
one
of
the
women
who
had
been
already
served
with
a
cup
and
had
resolved
to
go
in
as
she
said
for
another
pennyworth
so
it
is
my
ai
it
nice
said
her
companion
smacking
her
lips
whether
the
soldiers
fell
into
the
same
mistake
or
were
too
polite
to
take
notice
of
it
we
can
not
tell
for
they
drank
it
without
comment
and
with
evident
satisfaction
like
men
of
simple
tastes
and
uncritical
minds
we
turn
now
to
a
very
different
scene
in
one
of
the
private
of
the
institute
sat
poor
young
mrs
martin
the
very
embodiment
of
blank
despair
the
terrible
truth
that
her
husband
had
died
and
been
buried
at
sea
had
been
gently
and
tenderly
broken
to
her
by
miss
robinson
at
first
the
poor
girl
could
not
would
not
believe
it
then
as
the
truth
gradually
forced
itself
into
her
brain
she
subsided
into
a
tearless
expressionless
state
of
quiescence
that
seemed
to
indicate
a
mind
unhinged
in
this
state
she
remained
for
some
time
apparently
unconscious
of
the
kind
words
of
christian
love
that
were
addressed
to
her
at
last
she
seemed
to
rouse
herself
and
gazed
wildly
round
the
room
let
me
go
she
said
i
will
find
him
somewhere
do
hinder
me
please
but
you
can
not
go
anywhere
till
you
have
had
food
and
rest
dear
child
said
her
sympathetic
comforter
laying
her
hand
gently
on
the
girl
arm
come
with
me
she
sought
to
lead
her
away
but
the
girl
shook
her
off
no
she
exclaimed
starting
up
hastily
so
that
the
mass
of
her
dark
hair
fell
loose
upon
her
shoulders
contrasting
forcibly
with
the
dead
whiteness
of
her
face
and
lips
no
i
can
not
go
with
you
fred
will
be
getting
impatient
think
i
ever
believe
it
dead
and
buried
in
the
sea
never
even
while
she
spoke
the
gasp
in
her
voice
and
the
pressure
of
both
hands
on
her
poor
heart
told
very
plainly
that
the
young
widow
did
indeed
believe
it
oh
may
god
himself
comfort
you
dear
child
said
the
lady
taking
her
softly
by
the
hand
come
come
with
me
mrs
martin
no
longer
refused
her
spirit
which
had
flashed
up
for
a
moment
seemed
to
collapse
and
without
another
word
of
remonstrance
she
meekly
suffered
herself
to
be
guided
to
a
private
room
where
she
was
put
to
bed
she
never
rose
from
that
bed
friendless
and
without
means
she
would
probably
have
perished
in
the
streets
or
in
one
of
the
dens
of
portsmouth
had
she
not
been
led
to
this
refuge
as
it
was
they
nursed
her
there
and
did
all
that
human
skill
and
christian
love
could
devise
but
her
heart
was
broken
towards
the
end
she
told
them
in
a
faint
voice
that
her
fred
had
been
stationed
at
alexandria
and
that
while
there
he
had
been
led
to
put
his
trust
in
the
saviour
she
knew
nothing
of
the
details
all
these
and
much
more
she
had
expected
to
hear
from
his
own
lips
but
he
will
tell
me
all
about
it
soon
thank
god
were
the
last
words
she
uttered
as
she
turned
her
eyes
gratefully
on
the
loving
strangers
who
had
found
and
cared
for
her
in
the
dark
day
of
her
calamity
chapter
five
difficulties
met
and
overcome
miles
and
his
friend
brown
after
their
work
at
the
jetty
had
chanced
to
return
to
the
institute
at
the
moment
referred
to
in
the
last
chapter
when
the
poor
young
widow
having
become
resigned
had
been
led
through
the
passage
to
her
bedroom
our
hero
happened
to
catch
sight
of
her
face
and
it
made
a
very
powerful
impression
on
him
an
impression
which
was
greatly
deepened
afterwards
on
hearing
of
her
death
in
the
he
found
armstrong
still
in
earnest
conversation
with
his
wife
hallo
armstrong
still
here
have
you
been
sitting
there
since
i
left
you
he
asked
with
a
smile
and
look
of
surprise
oh
no
answered
his
friend
not
all
the
time
we
have
been
out
walking
about
town
and
we
have
had
dinner
here
an
excellent
feed
let
me
tell
you
and
cheap
too
but
where
did
you
run
off
to
sit
down
and
i
tell
you
said
miles
thereupon
he
related
all
about
his
day
experiences
when
he
had
finished
armstrong
told
him
that
his
own
prospect
of
testing
the
merits
of
a
were
pretty
fair
as
he
was
ordered
for
inspection
on
the
following
day
so
you
see
continued
the
young
soldier
if
you
are
accepted
as
you
are
sure
to
be
you
and
i
will
go
out
together
in
the
same
vessel
i
glad
to
hear
that
anyhow
returned
miles
and
am
very
glad
too
said
little
emily
with
a
beaming
smile
for
willie
has
told
me
about
you
mr
miles
and
how
you
first
met
and
took
a
fancy
to
each
other
and
it
be
so
nice
to
think
that
there
somebody
to
care
about
my
willie
when
he
is
far
away
from
me
the
little
woman
blushed
and
and
nearly
cried
as
she
said
this
for
she
felt
that
it
was
rather
a
bold
thing
to
say
to
a
stranger
and
yet
she
had
such
a
strong
desire
to
mitigate
her
desolation
when
absent
from
her
that
she
forcibly
overcame
her
modesty
and
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favour
mr
miles
she
added
i
do
it
with
pleasure
returned
our
gallant
hero
i
want
you
to
call
him
willie
said
the
little
woman
blushing
and
looking
down
certainly
i
will
if
your
husband
permits
me
you
see
she
continued
i
want
him
to
keep
familiar
with
the
name
i
been
used
to
call
him
for
comrades
will
call
him
armstrong
i
suppose
and
oh
emmy
interrupted
the
soldier
reproachfully
do
you
think
i
require
to
be
in
of
that
name
wo
your
voice
repeating
it
haunt
me
day
and
night
till
the
happy
day
when
i
meet
you
again
on
the
portsmouth
jetty
or
in
this
very
room
miles
thought
when
he
heard
this
speech
of
the
meeting
between
poor
mrs
martin
and
her
fred
and
a
feeling
of
profound
sadness
crept
over
him
as
he
reflected
how
many
chances
there
were
against
their
ever
again
meeting
in
this
world
naturally
these
thoughts
turned
his
mind
to
his
own
case
his
sinful
haste
in
quitting
home
and
the
agony
of
his
mother
on
finding
that
he
was
really
gone
were
more
than
ever
impressed
on
him
but
again
the
fatal
idea
that
what
was
done
could
not
be
undone
coupled
with
pride
and
false
shame
kept
him
firm
to
his
purpose
that
evening
in
barracks
miles
was
told
by
his
company
sergeant
to
hold
himself
in
readiness
to
appear
before
the
doctor
next
morning
for
inspection
as
to
his
physical
fitness
for
active
service
in
egypt
our
hero
was
by
this
time
beginning
to
find
out
that
the
life
of
a
private
soldier
into
which
he
had
rushed
was
a
very
different
thing
indeed
from
that
of
an
officer
to
which
he
had
aspired
here
again
pride
came
to
his
aid
in
a
certain
sense
for
if
it
could
not
reconcile
him
to
his
position
it
at
all
events
closed
his
mouth
and
made
him
resolve
to
bear
the
consequences
of
his
act
like
a
man
in
the
morning
he
had
to
turn
out
before
daylight
and
with
a
small
band
of
men
similarly
situated
to
muster
in
the
a
little
after
eight
thence
they
marched
to
the
doctor
quarters
it
was
an
anxious
ordeal
for
all
of
them
for
like
most
young
soldiers
they
were
enthusiastically
anxious
to
go
on
active
service
and
there
was
of
course
some
uncertainty
as
to
their
passing
the
examination
the
first
man
called
came
out
of
the
inspection
room
with
a
beaming
countenance
saying
that
he
was
all
right
which
raised
the
hopes
and
spirits
of
the
rest
but
the
second
appeared
after
inspection
with
a
countenance
which
required
no
interpretation
no
reason
was
given
for
his
rejection
he
was
simply
told
that
it
would
be
better
for
him
not
to
go
miles
was
the
third
called
as
he
presented
himself
the
doctor
yawned
vociferously
as
if
he
felt
that
the
hour
for
such
work
was
unreasonably
early
then
he
looked
at
his
subject
with
the
critical
air
of
a
farmer
inspecting
a
prize
ox
how
old
are
you
he
asked
nineteen
sir
are
you
married
miles
smiled
did
you
hear
me
asked
the
doctor
sharply
you
do
need
to
smile
many
a
boy
as
and
as
young
as
you
is
fool
enough
to
marry
are
you
married
miles
flushed
looked
suddenly
stern
squared
his
shoulders
drew
himself
up
with
an
air
that
implied
you
wo
catch
tripping
again
and
said
firmly
yet
quite
respectfully
no
sir
the
doctor
here
took
another
good
look
at
his
subject
with
a
meaning
twinkle
in
his
eye
as
if
he
felt
that
he
had
touched
a
tender
point
then
he
felt
his
victim
pulse
sounded
his
chest
and
ordered
him
to
strip
being
apparently
satisfied
with
the
result
of
his
examination
he
asked
him
if
he
felt
all
right
reflecting
that
his
mother
had
often
told
him
he
was
made
up
of
body
soul
and
spirit
and
that
in
regard
to
the
latter
two
he
was
rather
hazy
miles
felt
strongly
inclined
for
a
moment
to
say
certainly
not
but
thinking
better
of
it
he
answered
yes
sir
with
decision
have
you
anything
to
complain
of
asked
the
doctor
the
mind
of
our
hero
was
what
we
may
style
rapidly
reflective
in
regard
to
the
decrees
of
fate
things
in
general
and
his
conduct
in
particular
he
had
a
decided
wish
to
complain
but
again
he
laid
restraint
on
himself
and
said
no
sir
and
do
you
wish
to
go
to
egypt
yes
sir
was
answered
with
prompt
decision
then
you
may
go
said
the
doctor
turning
away
with
an
air
of
a
man
who
dismisses
a
subject
from
his
mind
when
all
the
men
had
thus
passed
the
medical
examination
those
of
them
who
were
accepted
mustered
their
bags
and
kits
before
captain
lacey
commander
of
the
company
to
which
they
were
attached
and
those
who
wanted
anything
were
allowed
to
draw
it
from
the
stores
captain
lacey
was
a
fine
specimen
of
a
british
soldier
grave
but
kind
in
expression
and
in
heart
tall
handsome
powerful
about
thirty
years
of
age
with
that
urbanity
of
manner
which
wins
affection
at
first
sight
and
that
cool
quiet
decision
of
character
which
inspires
unlimited
confidence
as
the
which
was
to
convey
them
to
egypt
was
to
start
sooner
than
had
been
intended
there
was
little
time
for
thought
during
the
few
hours
in
england
that
remained
to
the
regiment
the
men
had
to
draw
their
pith
helmets
and
fit
the
ornaments
thereon
then
go
the
quartermaster
stores
to
be
fitted
with
white
clothing
after
which
they
had
to
parade
before
the
colonel
fully
arrayed
in
the
martial
habiliments
which
were
needful
in
tropical
climes
besides
these
matters
there
were
friends
to
be
seen
in
some
cases
relatives
to
be
parted
from
and
letters
innumerable
to
be
written
miles
milton
was
among
those
who
on
the
last
day
in
portsmouth
attempted
to
write
home
he
had
been
taken
by
sergeant
gilroy
the
previous
night
to
one
of
the
institute
entertainments
in
the
great
hall
the
sergeant
had
tried
to
induce
him
to
go
to
the
with
him
but
miles
was
in
no
mood
for
that
at
the
time
and
he
was
greatly
relieved
to
find
that
neither
the
sergeant
nor
any
of
the
people
of
the
institute
annoyed
him
by
thrusting
religious
matters
on
his
attention
food
lodging
games
library
baths
entertainments
were
all
there
to
be
used
or
let
alone
as
he
chose
perfect
freedom
of
action
being
one
of
the
methods
by
which
it
was
sought
to
render
the
place
attractive
to
the
soldiers
but
although
miles
at
once
refused
to
go
to
the
class
he
had
no
objection
to
go
to
the
entertainment
it
was
a
curious
mixture
of
song
recitation
addresses
and
readings
in
which
many
noble
sentiments
were
uttered
and
not
a
few
humorous
anecdotes
and
incidents
related
it
was
presided
over
by
tufnell
the
manager
a
man
who
had
himself
originally
been
in
the
army
and
who
had
for
many
years
been
miss
robinson
man
there
could
not
have
been
fewer
than
a
thousand
people
in
the
hall
a
large
proportion
of
whom
were
and
the
rest
being
civilians
and
the
way
in
which
these
applauded
the
sentiments
laughed
at
the
humour
and
rejoiced
in
the
music
showed
that
the
provision
for
their
amusement
was
thoroughly
appreciated
whether
it
was
the
feeling
of
and
sympathy
that
pervaded
the
meeting
or
some
word
that
was
dropped
at
a
venture
and
found
root
in
his
heart
miles
could
not
tell
but
certain
it
is
that
at
that
entertainment
he
formed
the
resolution
to
write
home
before
leaving
not
that
he
had
yet
repented
of
the
step
he
had
taken
but
he
was
sorry
for
the
manner
in
which
he
had
done
so
and
for
allowing
so
much
time
to
elapse
that
now
the
opportunity
of
seeing
his
parents
before
starting
was
lost
as
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
write
his
letter
in
the
noise
of
the
he
went
off
next
day
to
the
of
the
institute
and
there
with
no
other
sounds
to
disturb
him
than
the
deep
breathing
of
some
studious
and
the
chirping
pen
of
a
comrade
engaged
like
himself
he
began
to
write
but
his
thoughts
somehow
would
not
work
his
pen
would
not
write
he
even
fancied
that
it
had
a
sort
of
objection
to
spell
so
it
had
when
not
properly
guided
by
his
hesitating
hand
the
first
part
went
swimmingly
enough
dearest
mother
i
so
sorry
but
here
he
stopped
for
the
memory
of
his
father
severity
his
indignation
and
he
felt
some
doubt
as
to
whether
he
really
was
sorry
then
under
the
impulse
of
this
doubt
he
wrote
a
long
letter
in
imagination
in
which
he
defended
his
conduct
pretty
warmly
on
the
ground
that
he
had
been
driven
to
it
driven
to
what
asked
something
within
him
to
the
course
which
i
have
taken
and
am
now
defending
replied
within
him
hotly
then
the
course
was
a
wrong
one
else
you
would
have
to
defend
it
rejoined
the
first
something
well
yes
it
was
returned
the
second
something
doggedly
before
this
internal
dispute
could
be
carried
further
miles
was
aroused
by
a
sudden
burst
of
noisy
voices
as
if
a
lunatic
asylum
had
been
let
loose
into
the
hall
below
rising
quickly
he
hurried
down
with
his
studious
comrades
to
see
what
it
could
be
all
about
it
only
another
come
in
and
they
all
come
up
here
without
giving
us
warning
to
get
ready
said
tufnell
as
he
bustled
about
endeavouring
to
introduce
order
into
what
appeared
to
miles
to
be
the
reproduction
of
babel
the
bricks
the
fact
was
that
a
having
arrived
rather
suddenly
a
sergeant
had
driven
up
in
hot
haste
from
the
docks
to
make
arrangements
for
the
reception
of
the
soldiers
wives
and
children
look
sharp
he
cried
on
entering
the
hall
abruptly
sixteen
families
are
on
their
way
to
you
all
right
we
can
take
in
was
the
prompt
reply
and
orders
were
given
to
set
the
machinery
of
the
establishment
instantly
in
motion
but
almost
before
the
preparation
had
fairly
begun
the
of
the
army
largely
composed
of
infantry
burst
upon
them
like
a
and
continued
to
pour
in
like
a
torrent
there
were
men
shouting
women
chattering
tired
children
whining
and
excited
children
laughing
babies
yelling
or
crowing
miscellaneously
parrots
screaming
people
running
up
and
down
stairs
in
search
of
dormitories
plates
and
cups
clattering
at
the
bar
as
the
overwhelmed
barmaids
did
their
best
to
appease
the
impatient
and
supply
the
hungry
while
the
rumbling
of
bringing
up
the
baggage
formed
a
sort
of
bass
accompaniment
to
the
concert
you
see
it
varies
with
us
a
good
deal
remarked
brown
to
miles
during
a
lucid
interval
sometimes
we
are
almost
empty
a
few
hours
later
we
are
overflowing
it
comes
hard
on
the
housekeeper
of
course
but
we
lay
our
account
wi
that
and
do
you
know
it
is
wonderful
what
can
be
done
in
trying
circumstances
when
we
lay
our
account
wi
them
yes
miss
it
all
ready
shouted
the
speaker
in
reply
to
a
soft
female
voice
that
came
down
the
wide
staircase
as
it
were
over
the
heads
of
the
turbulent
crowd
in
a
moment
he
disappeared
and
tufnell
stood
as
if
by
magic
in
his
place
yes
said
the
manager
taking
up
his
discourse
where
the
other
had
left
off
and
in
a
few
minutes
you
see
that
most
of
these
wives
and
children
of
the
soldiers
will
be
distributed
through
the
house
in
their
when
our
ladies
will
set
to
work
to
make
acquaintance
with
them
and
then
we
open
our
stores
of
warm
clothing
of
which
the
poor
things
coming
as
they
do
from
warm
climates
are
often
nearly
or
quite
destitute
but
where
do
you
get
these
supplies
from
asked
miles
from
christians
throughout
the
country
who
send
us
gifts
of
old
and
new
garments
boots
and
shoes
shawls
and
socks
etcetera
which
we
have
always
in
readiness
to
meet
sudden
demands
and
i
may
add
that
the
demands
are
pretty
constant
brown
told
you
just
now
that
we
have
varied
experience
i
remember
once
we
got
a
message
from
the
assistant
office
to
ask
how
many
women
and
children
we
could
accommodate
as
a
shipful
was
expected
we
replied
that
we
could
take
and
set
to
work
with
preparations
after
all
only
one
woman
came
we
expected
nobody
and
you
see
what
we
have
got
the
genial
countenance
of
the
manager
beamed
with
satisfaction
it
was
evident
that
what
he
had
got
did
not
at
all
discompose
him
as
he
hurried
away
to
look
after
his
flock
while
the
originator
the
heart
and
soul
of
all
this
although
confined
to
her
room
at
that
time
with
spine
complaint
and
unable
to
take
part
in
the
active
work
as
she
had
been
wont
to
do
in
years
gone
by
heard
in
her
chamber
the
softened
sound
of
the
human
storm
and
was
able
to
thank
god
that
her
institute
was
fulfilling
its
destiny
hallo
miles
exclaimed
armstrong
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
know
we
run
a
chance
of
being
late
come
along
quick
our
hero
who
in
his
interest
in
the
scene
had
forgotten
the
flight
of
time
hurried
out
after
his
comrade
as
the
band
struck
up
home
sweet
home
and
returned
to
barracks
utterly
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
he
had
left
the
unfinished
letter
to
his
mother
on
the
table
in
the
chapter
six
the
unfinished
letter
too
late
next
morning
young
milton
or
as
he
was
called
by
his
comrades
john
miles
rose
with
the
depressing
thought
that
it
was
to
be
his
last
day
in
england
as
he
was
dressing
it
flashed
across
him
that
he
had
left
his
unfinished
letter
on
the
table
and
concluding
that
it
would
be
swept
away
in
the
rush
of
people
there
at
all
events
that
not
having
been
folded
or
addressed
it
could
not
be
posted
his
depression
was
deepened
the
first
thing
that
roused
him
to
a
better
frame
of
mind
was
the
smell
of
tea
most
people
are
more
or
less
familiar
with
teapots
with
the
few
teaspoonfuls
of
the
precious
leaf
which
thrifty
housekeepers
put
into
these
pots
and
the
fragrant
liquid
that
results
but
who
among
civilians
save
the
informed
can
imagine
a
teapot
open
your
ears
o
ye
thrifty
ones
while
we
state
a
few
facts
and
there
will
be
no
need
to
tell
you
to
open
your
eyes
into
the
teapot
which
supplied
miles
with
his
morning
cup
there
was
put
for
making
eight
pounds
of
tea
not
ounces
observe
but
pounds
pounds
of
sugar
and
six
gallons
an
absolute
cowful
of
milk
the
pot
itself
consisted
of
eight
enormous
coppers
which
were
filled
with
boiling
water
to
the
brim
yes
sir
remarked
the
military
cook
who
concocted
the
beverage
to
a
speechless
visitor
one
day
it
a
pretty
extensive
brew
but
then
you
see
we
have
a
large
family
a
considerable
portion
of
this
large
family
was
soon
actively
engaged
in
preparation
for
immediate
embarkation
for
egypt
then
the
general
made
the
men
a
farewell
speech
it
was
a
peculiar
speech
not
altogether
suited
to
cheer
timid
hearts
had
any
such
been
there
but
admirably
adapted
to
british
soldiers
men
said
he
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
parade
looking
so
well
and
clean
and
comfortable
and
ready
for
active
service
you
will
be
dirty
enough
sometimes
where
you
are
going
for
the
country
is
hot
and
unhealthy
and
not
over
clean
you
will
have
hardships
hard
times
and
plenty
of
hard
work
as
well
as
hard
beds
now
and
then
and
very
likely
the
most
of
you
will
never
come
back
again
but
you
would
be
unworthy
of
the
name
of
british
soldiers
if
you
allowed
such
thoughts
to
trouble
your
minds
i
sincerely
express
the
hope
however
that
you
will
all
come
home
again
safe
and
sound
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
every
man
of
you
will
do
his
duty
in
the
field
faithfully
and
well
but
i
not
so
sure
of
your
wisdom
in
camp
and
barracks
so
i
will
give
you
a
word
of
advice
there
is
far
more
danger
in
getting
drunk
in
hot
countries
than
in
england
let
me
advise
you
then
not
to
get
drunk
and
i
would
warn
you
particularly
against
the
vile
stuff
they
will
offer
for
sale
in
egypt
it
is
rank
poison
if
you
had
stomachs
lined
with
brass
you
might
perhaps
stand
it
not
otherwise
then
i
would
warn
you
against
the
sun
in
egypt
the
sun
is
sometimes
like
a
fiery
furnace
never
expose
yourself
when
you
can
avoid
doing
so
and
above
all
never
go
outside
your
tents
without
your
helmets
on
if
you
do
you
repent
it
and
repentance
will
probably
come
too
late
i
wish
you
all
a
prosperous
voyage
and
may
god
keep
you
all
delivered
in
a
sharp
stern
unsentimental
tone
this
brief
speech
had
probably
a
much
more
powerful
effect
on
the
men
than
a
more
elaborate
exhortation
would
have
had
the
impression
was
deepened
by
the
remarks
of
an
old
officer
who
made
a
very
brief
soldierly
speech
after
the
general
winding
up
with
the
information
that
he
had
himself
been
in
egypt
and
assuring
them
that
if
they
did
not
take
care
of
themselves
there
was
little
chance
of
a
man
of
them
returning
alive
may
you
have
a
pleasant
passage
out
he
said
in
conclusion
and
in
the
name
of
the
portsmouth
division
i
wish
you
victory
in
all
your
battles
and
a
hearty
the
men
who
were
not
going
away
were
then
called
on
to
give
their
departing
friends
three
cheers
which
they
did
with
right
captain
lacey
who
was
in
charge
of
the
detachment
stepped
to
the
front
drew
his
sword
gave
the
order
to
shoulder
arms
form
fours
right
turn
quick
march
and
away
they
went
with
the
united
bands
of
two
regiments
playing
the
girl
i
left
behind
me
the
girls
they
were
about
to
leave
behind
them
were
awaiting
them
at
the
with
a
considerable
sprinkling
of
somewhat
older
girls
to
keep
them
company
many
of
the
poor
creatures
were
in
tears
for
the
men
whom
they
might
never
see
again
and
lumps
in
several
manly
throats
rather
interfered
with
the
parting
cheer
delivered
by
the
detachment
at
the
gate
most
of
them
accompanied
the
soldiers
as
far
as
the
dockyard
gates
emily
armstrong
was
not
among
them
she
had
parted
the
previous
night
from
her
husband
at
his
earnest
request
and
returned
by
rail
to
her
father
house
there
to
await
as
patiently
as
she
might
the
return
of
her
willie
noble
defenders
of
our
country
observed
an
enthusiastic
citizen
as
they
passed
through
the
gates
food
for
powder
remarked
a
sarcastic
publican
as
he
turned
away
to
resume
his
special
work
of
robbing
powder
of
its
food
and
his
country
of
its
defenders
proceeding
to
the
embarkation
jetty
the
detachment
was
marched
on
board
the
where
the
men
were
at
once
told
off
to
their
respective
messes
and
proceeded
without
delay
to
make
themselves
at
home
by
taking
possession
of
their
allotted
portion
of
the
huge
fabric
that
was
to
bear
them
over
the
waves
to
distant
lands
taking
off
their
belts
and
stowing
them
overhead
they
got
hold
of
their
bags
exchanged
their
smart
uniforms
for
old
suits
of
clothes
and
otherwise
prepared
themselves
for
the
endurance
of
life
on
board
a
transport
to
his
great
satisfaction
miles
found
that
several
of
the
comrades
for
whom
he
had
by
that
time
acquired
a
special
liking
were
appointed
to
the
same
mess
with
himself
among
these
were
his
friend
willie
armstrong
sergeants
gilroy
and
hardy
corporal
flynn
a
private
named
gaspard
redgrave
who
was
a
capital
musician
and
had
a
magnificent
tenor
voice
robert
macleod
a
scotsman
and
moses
pyne
a
cadaverous
nondescript
who
was
generally
credited
with
being
though
with
a
good
deal
of
method
in
his
madness
and
who
was
possessed
of
gentleness
of
spirit
and
a
cheerful
readiness
to
oblige
which
seemed
a
flat
contradiction
of
his
personal
appearance
and
rendered
him
a
general
favourite
while
these
were
busy
arranging
their
quarters
a
soldier
passed
with
several
books
in
his
hand
which
he
had
just
received
from
one
of
the
ladies
from
the
institute
hallo
jack
cried
moses
pyne
have
the
ladies
been
aboard
of
course
they
have
they
been
all
over
the
ship
already
distributin
books
an
if
you
want
to
see
you
have
to
look
sharp
moses
for
they
just
goin
on
shore
see
echoed
moses
of
course
i
wants
to
see
but
for
them
i
be
the
rest
of
the
sentence
was
lost
in
the
clatter
of
moses
feet
as
he
stumbled
up
the
remembering
his
letter
at
that
moment
miles
followed
him
and
reached
the
gangway
just
as
the
visitors
were
leaving
excuse
me
he
said
to
one
of
them
stopping
her
oh
i
so
glad
to
have
found
you
she
said
i
have
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
miss
robinson
sent
you
this
little
parcel
of
books
with
her
best
wishes
and
hopes
that
you
will
read
them
thanks
very
much
i
will
with
pleasure
and
will
you
do
me
a
favour
i
left
a
letter
on
the
table
a
sudden
and
peremptory
order
of
some
sort
caused
a
rush
which
separated
miles
from
the
visitor
and
cut
short
the
sentence
and
the
necessity
for
the
immediate
departure
of
all
visitors
rendered
its
being
finished
impossible
but
miss
robinson
representative
did
not
require
to
be
told
that
a
forgotten
letter
could
only
want
posting
on
returning
therefore
to
the
institute
she
went
at
once
to
the
where
she
found
no
letter
making
inquiry
she
learned
from
one
of
the
maids
that
a
sheet
of
paper
had
been
found
with
nothing
on
it
but
the
words
dearest
mother
i
so
sorry
and
that
the
same
had
been
duly
conveyed
to
miss
robinson
room
hasting
to
the
apartment
of
her
friend
she
knocked
and
was
bidden
enter
you
have
got
an
unfinished
letter
it
seems
she
began
yes
here
it
is
interrupted
miss
robinson
handing
the
sheet
to
her
assistant
what
a
pity
that
it
gives
no
clew
to
the
writer
no
address
i
am
pretty
sure
as
to
the
writer
returned
the
other
it
must
have
been
that
young
soldier
john
miles
of
whom
we
have
seen
a
little
and
heard
so
much
from
sergeant
gilroy
hereupon
an
account
was
given
of
the
hurried
and
interrupted
meeting
on
board
the
and
the
two
ladies
came
to
the
conclusion
that
as
nothing
was
known
about
the
parents
or
former
residence
of
john
miles
no
steps
of
any
kind
were
possible
the
letter
was
therefore
carefully
put
by
that
same
evening
there
alighted
at
the
railway
station
in
portsmouth
an
elderly
lady
with
an
expression
of
great
anxiety
on
her
countenance
and
much
perturbation
in
her
manner
any
luggage
asked
a
sympathetic
porter
for
railway
porters
are
sometimes
more
sympathetic
than
might
be
expected
of
men
so
much
accustomed
to
witness
abrupt
and
tender
partings
no
no
luggage
yes
a
small
valise
in
the
carriage
that
it
eh
no
yes
yes
where
to
asked
the
sympathetic
porter
after
the
lady
was
seated
in
the
cab
where
to
echoed
mrs
milton
for
it
was
she
in
great
distress
oh
where
where
shall
i
drive
to
really
i
could
say
answered
the
porter
with
a
modest
look
i
i
my
son
my
dear
boy
where
shall
i
go
to
inquire
oh
what
i
do
these
would
have
been
perplexing
utterances
even
to
an
unsympathetic
man
turning
away
from
the
window
and
looking
up
at
the
driver
the
porter
said
solemnly
to
the
best
you
know
of
cabby
that
not
too
dear
an
if
you
bin
gifted
with
compassion
cabby
do
overcharge
your
fare
accepting
the
direction
and
exercising
his
discretion
as
well
as
his
compassion
that
intelligent
cabby
drove
strange
to
say
straight
to
an
hotel
styled
the
officers
house
which
is
an
offshoot
of
miss
robinson
institute
and
stands
close
beside
it
a
hofficer
lady
said
the
inventive
cabby
to
the
boy
who
opened
the
door
wants
to
putt
up
in
this
when
poor
mrs
milton
had
calmed
her
feelings
sufficiently
to
admit
of
her
talking
with
some
degree
of
coherence
she
rang
the
bell
and
sent
for
the
landlord
mr
tufnell
who
was
landlord
of
the
officers
house
as
well
as
manager
of
the
institute
soon
presented
himself
and
to
him
the
poor
lady
confided
her
sorrows
you
see
landlord
she
said
whimpering
i
do
know
a
soul
in
portsmouth
and
and
in
fact
i
do
even
know
how
i
came
to
your
hotel
for
i
never
heard
of
it
before
but
i
think
i
must
have
been
sent
here
for
i
see
from
your
looks
that
you
will
help
me
you
may
depend
on
my
helping
you
to
the
best
of
my
power
madam
may
i
ask
what
you
would
have
me
do
with
much
earnestness
and
not
a
few
tears
poor
mrs
milton
related
as
much
of
her
son
story
as
she
thought
necessary
well
you
could
not
have
come
to
a
better
place
said
tufnell
for
miss
robinson
and
all
her
helpers
sympathise
deeply
with
soldiers
if
any
one
can
find
out
about
your
son
can
how
were
you
led
to
suspect
that
he
had
come
to
portsmouth
a
friend
suggested
that
he
might
possibly
have
done
so
indeed
it
seems
natural
considering
my
dear
boy
desire
to
enter
the
army
and
the
number
of
soldiers
who
are
always
passing
through
this
town
well
i
will
go
at
once
and
make
inquiry
the
name
milton
is
not
familiar
to
me
but
so
many
come
and
go
that
we
sometimes
forget
names
when
poor
mrs
milton
was
afterwards
introduced
to
miss
robinson
she
found
her
both
sympathetic
and
anxious
to
do
her
utmost
to
gain
information
about
her
missing
son
but
the
mother
graphic
descriptions
of
him
did
not
avail
much
the
fact
that
he
was
young
tall
handsome
etcetera
applied
to
so
many
of
the
defenders
of
the
country
as
to
be
scarcely
distinctive
enough
but
when
she
spoke
of
my
dear
miles
a
new
light
was
thrown
on
the
matter
she
was
told
that
a
young
soldier
answering
to
the
description
of
her
son
had
been
there
recently
but
that
his
surname
not
his
christian
name
was
miles
would
she
recognise
his
handwriting
recognise
it
exclaimed
mrs
milton
in
a
blaze
of
sudden
hope
ay
that
i
would
did
i
teach
him
every
letter
myself
did
he
insist
on
making
his
crooked
and
was
my
heart
almost
broken
over
his
square
o
while
the
poor
mother
was
speaking
the
unfinished
letter
was
laid
before
her
and
the
handwriting
at
once
recognised
that
his
bless
him
and
he
sorry
did
i
say
he
would
be
sorry
did
i
tell
his
father
so
darling
miles
i
here
the
poor
creature
broke
down
and
wept
at
the
thought
of
her
repentant
son
it
was
well
perhaps
that
the
blow
was
thus
softened
for
she
almost
fell
on
the
floor
when
her
new
friend
told
her
in
the
gentlest
possible
manner
that
miles
had
that
very
day
set
sail
for
egypt
they
kept
her
at
the
institute
that
night
however
and
consoled
her
much
as
well
as
aroused
her
gratitude
by
telling
of
the
good
men
who
formed
part
of
her
son
regiment
and
of
the
books
and
kind
words
that
had
been
bestowed
on
him
at
parting
and
by
making
the
most
they
could
of
the
good
hope
that
the
fighting
in
egypt
would
soon
be
over
and
that
her
son
would
ere
long
return
to
her
god
willing
sound
and
well
chapter
seven
miles
begins
to
discover
himself
has
a
few
rough
experiences
and
falls
into
and
love
while
his
mother
was
hunting
for
him
in
portsmouth
miles
milton
was
cleaving
his
way
through
the
watery
highway
of
the
world
at
the
rate
of
fifteen
knots
he
was
at
the
time
in
that
lowest
condition
of
misery
mental
and
physical
which
is
not
unfrequently
the
result
of
a
chopping
sea
in
the
channel
it
seemed
to
him
just
then
an
unbelievable
mystery
how
he
could
at
any
time
have
experienced
pleasure
at
the
contemplation
of
food
the
heaving
of
the
great
white
ship
was
nothing
to
the
heaving
well
it
may
perhaps
be
wiser
to
refrain
from
particulars
but
he
felt
that
the
beating
of
the
two
thousand
engines
more
or
less
was
to
the
throbbing
of
his
brain
and
this
he
thought
in
the
bitterness
of
his
soul
this
is
what
i
have
sacrificed
home
friends
position
prospects
in
life
for
this
is
soldiering
the
merest
shadow
of
the
power
to
reason
if
such
a
shadow
had
been
left
might
have
convinced
him
that
that
was
soldiering
that
as
far
as
it
went
it
was
not
even
sailoring
you
very
bad
i
fear
remarked
a
gentle
voice
at
the
side
of
his
hammock
miles
looked
round
it
was
lanky
cadaverous
moses
pyne
who
told
you
i
was
bad
asked
miles
savagely
putting
a
wrong
but
too
true
interpretation
on
the
word
the
colour
of
your
cheeks
tells
me
poor
fellow
bah
exclaimed
miles
he
was
too
sick
to
say
more
he
might
have
said
less
with
advantage
shall
i
fetch
you
some
soup
asked
moses
in
the
kindness
of
his
heart
moses
you
see
was
one
of
those
lucky
individuals
who
are
born
with
an
incapacity
to
be
sick
at
sea
and
was
utterly
ignorant
of
the
cruelty
he
perpetrated
or
some
lobscouse
he
added
go
away
gasped
miles
a
basin
of
miles
exploded
literally
as
well
as
metaphorically
and
moses
retired
strange
thought
that
healthy
soldier
as
he
stalked
away
on
further
errands
of
mercy
stooping
as
he
went
to
avoid
beams
strange
that
miles
is
so
changeable
in
character
i
had
come
to
think
him
a
steady
reliable
sort
of
chap
puzzling
over
this
difficulty
he
advanced
to
the
side
of
another
hammock
from
which
heavy
groans
were
issuing
are
you
very
bad
corporal
he
asked
in
his
usual
tone
of
sympathy
bad
is
it
said
flynn
och
it
worse
nor
bad
i
am
could
ye
ax
the
captin
to
for
a
the
suggestive
influence
of
was
too
much
for
flynn
he
pulled
up
dead
after
a
few
moments
he
groaned
arrah
be
off
moses
av
ye
do
want
my
fist
on
yer
nose
extraordinary
murmured
the
kindly
man
as
he
removed
to
another
hammock
the
occupant
of
which
was
differently
constituted
moses
he
said
as
the
visitant
approached
yes
gaspard
was
the
eager
reply
can
i
do
anything
for
you
yes
if
you
go
on
deck
refresh
yourself
with
a
walk
and
leave
us
all
alone
you
con
fer
on
gaspard
ceased
to
speak
he
had
already
spoken
too
much
and
moses
pyne
still
wondering
quietly
took
his
advice
but
if
the
channel
was
bad
the
bay
of
biscay
was
according
to
flynn
far
badder
before
reaching
that
celebrated
bay
however
most
of
the
men
had
recovered
and
with
more
or
less
lugubrious
aspects
and
complexions
were
staggering
about
attending
to
their
various
duties
no
doubt
their
movements
about
the
vessel
were
for
some
time
characterised
by
that
disagreement
between
action
and
will
which
is
sometimes
observed
in
feeble
chickens
during
a
high
wind
but
on
the
whole
activity
and
cheerfulness
soon
began
to
the
frames
and
spirits
of
britain
warriors
and
now
miles
milton
began
to
find
out
as
well
as
to
fix
in
some
degree
his
natural
character
up
to
this
period
in
his
life
a
mild
existence
in
a
quiet
home
under
a
fairly
good
though
irascible
father
and
a
loving
christian
mother
had
not
afforded
him
much
opportunity
of
discovering
what
he
was
made
of
recent
events
had
taught
him
pretty
sharply
that
there
was
much
room
for
improvement
he
also
discovered
that
he
possessed
a
very
determined
will
in
the
carrying
out
of
his
intentions
especially
when
those
intentions
were
based
upon
his
desires
whether
he
would
be
equally
resolute
in
carrying
out
intentions
that
did
harmonise
with
his
desires
remained
to
be
seen
his
mother
among
her
other
teachings
had
often
tried
to
impress
on
his
young
mind
the
difference
between
obstinacy
and
firmness
my
boy
she
was
wont
to
say
while
smoothing
his
curly
head
mistake
obstinacy
for
firmness
a
man
who
says
do
this
or
that
in
spite
of
all
the
world
against
advice
and
simply
because
he
to
do
it
is
obstinate
a
man
who
says
do
this
or
that
in
spite
of
all
the
world
against
advice
against
his
own
desires
and
simply
because
it
is
the
right
thing
to
do
is
firm
remembering
this
and
repenting
bitterly
his
having
so
cruelly
forsaken
his
mother
our
hero
cast
about
in
his
mind
how
best
he
could
put
some
of
her
precepts
into
practice
as
being
the
only
consolation
that
was
now
possible
to
him
you
see
the
good
seed
sown
in
those
early
days
was
beginning
to
spring
up
in
unlikely
circumstances
of
course
the
habit
of
prayer
and
reading
a
few
verses
from
the
bible
night
and
morning
recurred
to
him
this
had
been
given
up
since
he
left
home
he
now
resumed
it
though
for
convenience
he
prayed
while
stretched
in
his
hammock
but
this
did
not
satisfy
him
he
must
needs
undertake
some
disagreeable
work
and
carry
it
out
with
that
degree
of
obstinacy
which
would
amount
to
firmness
after
mature
consideration
he
sought
and
obtained
permission
to
become
one
of
the
two
cooks
to
his
mess
moses
pyne
was
the
other
nothing
he
felt
could
be
more
alien
to
his
nature
more
disgusting
in
every
way
to
his
feelings
and
he
was
right
his
dislike
to
the
duties
seemed
rather
to
increase
than
to
diminish
day
by
day
bitterly
did
he
repent
of
having
undertaken
the
duty
and
earnestly
did
he
consider
whether
there
might
not
be
some
possible
and
honourable
way
of
drawing
back
but
he
discovered
none
and
soon
he
proved
to
himself
as
well
as
to
others
that
he
did
indeed
possess
at
least
in
some
degree
firmness
of
character
the
duties
that
devolved
on
him
were
trying
he
had
to
scrub
and
keep
the
mess
clean
and
tidy
to
draw
all
the
provisions
and
prepare
them
for
cooking
then
to
take
them
to
the
galley
and
fetch
them
when
cooked
that
this
last
was
no
simple
matter
such
as
any
waiter
might
undertake
was
brought
forcibly
out
one
day
during
what
seamen
style
dirty
weather
it
was
raining
at
the
time
the
sea
was
grey
the
sky
was
greyer
and
as
the
steamer
itself
was
it
was
a
grave
business
altogether
is
the
soup
ready
moses
asked
miles
as
he
ascended
towards
the
deck
and
met
his
coming
down
i
do
know
shall
i
go
an
see
no
you
can
go
and
look
after
the
table
i
will
fetch
the
soup
a
nasty
sea
on
remarked
a
voice
which
sounded
familiar
in
ears
as
he
stepped
on
deck
hallo
jack
molloy
he
exclaimed
catching
hold
of
a
stanchion
to
steady
himself
as
a
tremendous
roll
of
the
vessel
caused
a
sea
to
flash
over
the
side
and
send
a
in
his
face
what
part
of
the
sky
did
you
drop
from
i
thought
i
had
left
you
snug
in
the
werry
likely
you
did
john
miles
answered
the
tar
balancing
himself
with
perfect
ease
and
caring
no
more
for
spray
than
if
he
had
been
a
dolphin
but
i
here
for
all
that
one
o
the
crew
o
this
here
transport
though
i
means
to
wolunteer
for
active
sarvice
when
i
gets
out
an
no
wonder
we
did
come
across
each
other
sooner
in
sitch
a
enormous
tubful
o
lobsters
etceterer
it
a
wonder
we
met
at
all
an
you
bin
a
good
deal
under
hatches
since
you
come
molloy
said
this
with
a
knowing
look
and
a
grin
miles
met
the
remark
in
a
similar
spirit
yes
jack
i
been
paying
tribute
to
neptune
lately
you
looks
like
it
miles
judgin
by
the
colour
o
your
jib
where
away
now
going
for
our
soup
what
made
you
cook
o
the
mess
ay
do
you
wish
you
were
me
another
roll
and
flash
of
spray
ended
the
conversation
and
separated
the
friends
the
was
ready
when
our
hero
reached
the
galley
having
filled
the
with
the
appetising
mixture
he
commenced
the
return
journey
with
great
care
for
he
was
now
dependent
entirely
on
his
legs
both
hands
being
engaged
miles
was
handy
if
we
may
say
so
with
his
legs
once
or
twice
he
had
to
rush
and
thrust
a
shoulder
against
the
bulwarks
and
a
dash
of
spray
served
for
salt
to
the
soup
but
he
was
progressing
favourably
and
had
traversed
full
of
the
distance
to
the
hatch
when
a
loud
hooroo
caused
him
to
look
round
smartly
he
had
just
time
to
see
corporal
flynn
who
had
slipped
and
fallen
come
rolling
towards
him
like
a
sack
of
flour
next
moment
he
was
swept
off
his
legs
and
went
into
the
lee
scuppers
with
his
comrade
in
a
bath
of
and
fortunately
the
obliging
wave
which
came
at
the
same
moment
mingled
with
the
soup
and
saved
both
men
from
a
scalding
such
mishaps
however
were
rare
and
they
served
rather
to
enliven
the
voyage
than
otherwise
besides
the
duties
already
mentioned
our
hero
had
to
wash
up
all
the
dishes
and
other
things
at
to
polish
up
the
and
tin
dishes
and
generally
to
put
things
away
in
their
places
and
keep
things
in
order
recollecting
another
of
his
teachings
whatever
is
worth
doing
at
all
is
worth
doing
well
he
tried
his
best
and
was
so
ably
seconded
by
the
amiable
moses
that
the
mess
came
to
be
at
last
regarded
as
the
one
on
board
one
morning
after
clearing
up
the
dishes
and
putting
things
in
order
miles
went
on
deck
for
a
little
fresh
air
on
the
way
up
he
met
an
elderly
gentleman
whose
dress
proclaimed
him
a
clergyman
he
looked
earnestly
at
our
hero
and
nodding
kindly
spoke
a
few
words
to
him
in
passing
miles
had
been
aware
that
there
was
a
clergyman
on
board
going
out
to
egypt
with
his
family
whether
in
connection
with
the
troops
or
for
health
he
did
not
know
he
was
much
impressed
with
the
looks
and
expression
of
this
man
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
there
were
some
sort
of
attractive
power
about
him
which
was
unaccountably
strong
and
he
felt
quite
interested
in
the
prospect
of
hearing
him
preach
on
the
following
sunday
while
on
deck
the
previous
day
he
had
seen
the
figures
of
two
ladies
whom
he
rightly
judged
to
be
the
family
above
referred
to
but
as
there
was
nearly
the
whole
distance
of
the
ship
length
between
them
he
could
not
distinguish
their
faces
on
taking
his
place
when
sunday
came
he
observed
that
the
family
were
present
seated
however
in
such
a
position
that
he
could
only
see
their
backs
speculating
in
a
listless
way
as
to
what
sort
of
faces
they
had
he
whiled
away
the
few
minutes
before
the
service
began
he
was
recalled
from
this
condition
by
the
tones
of
the
voice
which
seemed
to
have
the
same
effect
on
him
as
his
look
and
manner
had
the
day
they
first
met
during
the
sermon
miles
attention
was
riveted
insomuch
that
he
almost
forgot
where
he
was
the
text
was
a
familiar
one
god
is
love
but
the
treatment
of
it
seemed
entirely
new
the
boundless
nature
of
that
love
its
incomprehensible
and
almighty
force
its
enduring
certainty
and
its
overwhelming
immensity
embracing
as
it
did
the
whole
universe
in
christ
were
themes
on
which
the
preacher
expatiated
in
a
way
that
miles
had
never
before
dreamed
of
all
subordinate
love
said
the
preacher
in
concluding
has
its
source
in
this
no
wonder
then
that
it
is
spoken
of
in
scripture
as
a
love
passeth
knowledge
when
the
men
rose
to
leave
it
could
be
easily
seen
that
they
were
deeply
impressed
as
they
went
out
slowly
miles
passed
close
to
the
place
where
the
ladies
sat
the
slighter
of
the
two
was
talking
in
a
low
tone
to
her
companion
and
the
young
soldier
was
struck
with
the
wonderful
resemblance
in
her
tone
to
that
of
the
preacher
he
wondered
if
her
face
also
resembled
his
in
any
degree
and
glanced
back
but
the
head
was
turned
away
i
like
that
parson
he
has
got
remarked
sergeant
hardy
as
he
walked
along
the
deck
with
sergeant
gilroy
and
corporal
flynn
sur
an
i
like
him
too
said
the
corporal
for
he
got
heart
and
brains
returned
gilroy
a
grand
combination
what
more
could
we
want
do
you
think
that
is
also
essential
asked
miles
but
for
the
preacher
eloquence
his
heart
and
brain
would
have
worked
in
vain
come
now
john
miles
do
you
be
risin
up
into
poethry
it
not
yer
natur
though
ye
think
it
is
besides
av
a
man
heart
an
brains
is
all
right
he
can
make
good
use
of
widout
much
tongue
me
own
notion
is
that
it
thim
as
has
got
much
to
spake
of
aither
of
heart
or
brain
as
is
o
waggin
the
tongue
that
so
flynn
you
a
living
example
of
the
truth
of
your
own
opinion
retorted
miles
och
is
it
angered
ye
are
at
gittin
the
worst
o
the
argiment
rejoined
the
corporal
niver
mind
boy
you
do
better
by
and
by
as
flynn
descended
the
ladder
while
he
spoke
the
sense
of
what
he
said
was
lost
but
the
truth
of
his
opinion
still
continued
to
receive
illustration
from
the
rumbling
of
his
voice
until
it
was
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
of
the
vessel
next
day
our
hero
received
a
shock
from
which
he
never
finally
recovered
be
not
alarmed
reader
it
was
not
paralytic
in
its
nature
it
happened
on
this
wise
miles
had
occasion
to
go
to
the
fore
part
of
the
ship
on
some
culinary
business
without
his
coat
and
with
his
sleeves
rolled
up
above
his
elbows
arrived
there
he
found
that
the
captain
was
taking
the
ladies
round
the
ship
to
point
out
some
of
its
interesting
details
as
miles
came
up
the
younger
lady
turned
round
so
as
to
present
her
full
face
to
him
it
was
then
that
poor
miles
received
the
shock
above
referred
to
at
that
moment
a
little
boy
with
wings
and
a
bow
stepped
right
in
front
of
the
young
lady
and
shot
straight
at
miles
milton
the
arrow
entered
his
heart
and
he
no
he
did
not
fall
true
men
in
such
circumstances
never
fall
they
stand
transfixed
sometimes
or
stupefied
thus
stood
miles
and
stared
yes
though
naturally
modest
and
polite
he
stood
and
stared
and
small
blame
to
him
as
flynn
might
have
said
for
before
him
stood
his
ideal
of
a
fairy
an
angel
a
sylph
or
anything
beautiful
that
best
suits
your
fancy
reader
sunny
hair
sunny
eyes
earnest
and
inquiring
eyes
sunny
smiles
and
eyebrows
to
match
yes
she
had
eyebrows
distinctly
darker
than
her
hair
and
over
a
pair
of
large
brown
eyes
poor
miles
was
stricken
as
we
have
said
but
would
you
believe
it
there
were
men
there
looking
at
that
girl
at
that
time
who
to
use
their
own
phraseology
would
not
have
accepted
a
dozen
of
her
for
the
girls
they
had
left
behind
them
one
young
fellow
in
particular
murmured
to
himself
as
follows
yes
very
well
in
her
way
no
doubt
but
she
could
hold
a
candle
to
my
emmy
perhaps
the
most
cutting
remark
of
all
made
mentally
of
course
was
that
of
sergeant
grady
who
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
had
left
a
wife
describable
as
a
stout
girl
of
forty
behind
him
in
twenty
years
or
so
he
thought
she
may
perhaps
be
near
as
as
my
susy
but
she
never
come
quite
up
to
her
never
come
this
way
mrs
drew
said
the
captain
i
will
show
you
the
men
quarters
out
of
the
way
my
man
flushing
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
miles
stepped
hastily
aside
as
he
did
so
there
was
heard
an
awful
rend
of
a
sort
that
tests
the
temper
of
women
it
was
followed
by
a
musical
scream
the
girl
dress
had
caught
on
a
block
tackle
miles
leaped
forward
and
unhooked
it
he
was
rewarded
with
a
smiling
thank
you
which
was
followed
by
a
blush
of
confusion
as
miss
mother
exclaimed
oh
marion
how
you
by
way
of
making
things
easier
for
her
no
doubt
you
did
that
young
man
about
as
smart
as
i
could
a
done
it
myself
growled
a
voice
behind
him
the
speaker
was
jack
molloy
and
a
general
titter
followed
miles
as
he
hurried
away
as
we
have
said
the
weather
became
much
worse
when
the
drew
near
to
the
bay
of
biscay
and
it
soon
became
evident
that
they
were
not
to
cross
that
famous
portion
of
the
atlantic
without
experiencing
some
of
the
violent
action
for
which
it
is
famed
but
by
that
time
most
of
the
soldiers
according
to
molloy
had
got
their
on
and
rather
enjoyed
the
tossing
than
otherwise
i
do
like
this
sort
o
thing
said
a
beardless
young
fellow
as
a
number
of
the
men
sat
on
or
stood
on
the
of
the
deck
chatting
together
about
past
times
and
future
prospects
ha
exclaimed
a
seaman
who
stood
near
them
coiling
up
a
rope
hold
on
till
you
got
a
taste
o
the
bay
this
is
a
to
that
and
you
have
the
chance
if
you
do
i
a
dutchman
if
i
do
you
have
a
taste
of
it
too
old
for
we
in
the
same
boat
retorted
the
young
true
but
we
ai
in
the
same
body
returned
the
sailor
i
should
just
like
to
see
your
legs
wobblin
about
in
a
gale
you
sing
another
song
come
macleod
cried
moses
pyne
tip
us
a
gaelic
song
hoots
man
wull
ye
be
wantin
to
be
made
for
that
do
it
said
the
big
scotsman
na
na
let
gaspard
sing
us
bay
biscay
o
that
be
mair
appropriate
there
was
a
general
chorus
of
assent
to
this
and
as
gaspard
redgrave
was
an
obliging
man
untroubled
by
false
modesty
he
cleared
his
throat
and
began
his
voice
being
a
really
splendid
one
attracted
all
the
men
who
chanced
to
be
within
range
of
it
among
others
miles
who
was
passing
at
the
moment
with
a
bag
of
biscuits
in
one
hand
and
a
in
the
other
he
leaned
up
against
one
of
those
funnels
which
send
fresh
air
down
to
the
stokers
of
he
had
listened
only
a
few
moments
when
marion
drew
glided
amongst
the
men
and
seemed
to
stand
as
if
entranced
with
delight
in
front
of
him
steadying
herself
by
a
rope
for
the
vessel
was
pitching
a
good
deal
as
well
as
rolling
considerably
at
the
first
chorus
the
crowd
burst
forth
with
wild
enthusiasm
as
we
lay
on
that
day
in
the
bay
of
biscay
o
dwelling
with
unnecessary
length
and
emphasis
on
the
o
at
the
close
of
the
second
verse
the
men
were
preparing
to
burst
forth
again
when
miles
observed
an
approaching
billow
which
caused
him
to
start
in
alarm
although
unused
to
the
aspect
of
waves
he
had
an
instinctive
feeling
that
there
was
danger
approaching
voices
of
warning
were
promptly
raised
from
different
parts
of
the
vessel
but
already
the
loud
chorus
had
begun
and
drowned
every
other
sound
miles
dropped
his
biscuits
and
sprang
towards
marion
who
with
flashing
eyes
and
parted
lips
was
gazing
at
gaspard
he
just
reached
her
when
the
wave
burst
over
the
side
and
catching
most
of
the
men
quite
unprepared
swept
them
with
terrible
violence
towards
the
of
the
deck
marion
was
standing
directly
in
the
line
of
this
human
cataract
but
miles
swung
her
deftly
round
into
the
lee
of
the
funnel
a
handle
of
which
she
happily
caught
and
clung
to
it
like
a
limpet
her
preserver
was
not
so
fortunate
the
edge
of
the
cataract
struck
him
swept
him
off
his
legs
and
hurled
him
with
many
comrades
against
the
lee
bulwarks
where
he
lay
stunned
and
helpless
in
the
swishing
water
of
course
soldiers
and
sailors
ran
from
all
parts
of
the
vessel
to
the
rescue
and
soon
the
injured
men
were
carried
below
and
attended
to
by
the
doctors
and
considering
the
nature
of
the
accident
it
was
matter
for
surprise
that
the
result
was
no
worse
than
some
pretty
severe
contusions
and
a
few
broken
ribs
when
miles
recovered
consciousness
he
found
himself
in
his
hammock
with
considerable
pain
in
various
parts
of
his
body
and
the
reverend
james
drew
bending
over
him
you
all
right
now
my
fine
fellow
he
said
in
a
low
comforting
voice
no
bones
broken
so
the
doctors
say
only
a
little
bruised
tell
me
sir
said
miles
rousing
himself
is
is
your
daughter
safe
yes
thanks
be
to
god
and
to
your
prompt
assistance
she
is
none
the
worse
save
the
fright
and
a
wetting
miles
sank
back
on
his
pillows
with
a
feeling
of
profound
satisfaction
now
you
must
try
to
sleep
if
you
can
said
the
clergyman
it
will
do
you
good
but
miles
did
not
want
anything
to
do
him
good
he
was
quite
content
to
lie
still
and
enjoy
the
simple
fact
that
he
had
rescued
marion
perhaps
from
death
at
all
events
from
serious
injury
as
for
pain
what
was
that
to
him
was
he
not
a
soldier
one
whose
profession
requires
him
to
suffer
cheerfully
in
the
discharge
of
duty
and
was
not
love
the
highest
duty
on
the
strength
of
some
such
thoughts
he
forgot
his
pain
and
calmly
went
to
sleep
chapter
eight
has
reference
to
many
things
connected
with
mind
matter
and
affections
the
wave
which
had
burst
with
such
disastrous
effect
on
the
deck
of
the
was
but
the
herald
of
one
of
those
short
wild
storms
which
occasionally
sweep
with
desolating
violence
over
the
atlantic
ocean
and
too
frequently
strew
with
wreck
the
western
shores
of
europe
in
the
bay
of
biscay
as
usual
the
power
of
the
gale
was
felt
more
severely
than
elsewhere
there
some
sort
o
mystery
about
the
matter
said
jack
molloy
to
william
armstrong
as
they
cowered
together
under
the
shelter
of
the
bridge
why
the
atlantic
should
tumble
into
this
bay
with
greater
wiolence
than
elsewhere
is
beyond
my
comprehension
but
any
man
half
an
eye
can
see
that
it
do
it
jist
look
at
that
there
was
something
indeed
to
look
at
for
even
while
he
spoke
a
mighty
wave
tumbled
on
board
of
the
vessel
rushed
over
the
fore
deck
like
niagara
rapids
in
miniature
and
slushed
wildly
about
for
a
considerable
time
before
it
found
its
way
through
the
scuppers
into
the
grey
wilderness
of
heaving
billows
from
which
it
sprang
the
great
ship
quivered
and
seemed
for
a
moment
to
stagger
under
the
blow
while
the
wind
shrieked
through
the
rigging
as
if
laughing
at
the
success
of
its
efforts
but
the
hull
rose
heavily
yet
steadily
out
of
the
churning
foam
rode
triumphant
over
the
billow
that
had
struck
her
and
dived
ponderously
into
the
valley
of
waters
beyond
do
you
think
said
the
young
soldier
whose
general
knowledge
was
a
little
more
extensive
than
that
of
the
seaman
that
the
gulf
stream
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
molloy
looked
at
the
deck
with
philosophically
solemn
countenance
deriving
no
apparent
inspiration
from
that
quarter
he
gazed
on
the
tumultuous
chaos
of
with
a
perplexed
expression
finally
and
gravely
he
shook
his
head
ca
see
that
nohow
he
said
in
course
i
knows
that
the
gulf
stream
comes
out
the
gulf
o
mexico
cuts
across
the
atlantic
in
a
direction
goes
slap
agin
the
west
of
england
ireland
and
scotland
and
then
scurries
away
up
the
coast
o
norway
though
it
should
do
so
is
best
known
to
itself
it
arter
the
fashion
of
an
angry
woman
accordin
to
its
own
sweet
will
but
what
has
that
got
for
to
do
wi
the
bay
of
biscay
o
that
wot
i
wants
to
know
more
to
do
with
it
than
you
think
jack
answered
the
soldier
in
the
first
place
you
not
quite
though
partly
correct
about
the
gulf
stream
well
i
ai
zactly
a
scienkrific
stoodent
you
know
do
purfess
to
be
just
so
jack
neither
am
i
but
i
have
inquired
into
this
matter
in
a
general
way
an
here
notions
about
it
draw
it
fine
willum
do
be
flowery
said
the
sailor
renewing
his
quid
moreover
if
you
take
the
advice
of
an
old
salt
you
keep
a
tighter
grip
o
that
you
got
hold
of
unless
you
wants
to
be
washed
overboard
now
then
fire
away
i
all
attention
as
the
cat
said
at
the
mouth
o
the
well
then
began
armstrong
with
the
slightly
conscious
air
of
superior
knowledge
the
gulf
stream
does
rise
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
did
i
say
that
it
did
willum
well
you
said
that
it
out
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
no
doubt
so
far
you
are
right
but
what
i
mean
is
that
it
does
not
originate
there
do
you
say
what
you
mean
then
willum
instead
o
pitchin
into
a
poor
chap
as
makes
no
pretence
to
be
a
purfessor
heave
ahead
well
jack
continued
the
soldier
with
more
care
as
to
his
statements
i
believe
on
the
best
authority
that
the
gulf
stream
is
only
part
of
a
great
ocean
current
which
originates
at
the
equator
and
a
small
bit
of
which
flows
north
into
the
atlantic
where
it
drives
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
finding
no
outlet
there
it
rushes
violently
round
the
gulf
gits
angry
no
doubt
an
that
what
makes
it
hot
suggested
the
sailor
perhaps
anyhow
it
then
flows
as
you
say
in
a
direction
to
the
coasts
of
great
britain
and
ireland
but
it
does
more
than
that
it
spreads
as
it
goes
and
also
rushes
straight
at
the
coasts
of
france
and
spain
here
however
it
meets
a
strong
counter
current
running
south
along
these
same
coasts
of
france
an
spain
that
is
difficulty
number
one
it
has
to
do
battle
wi
that
current
and
you
know
jack
wherever
there
a
battle
there
apt
to
be
convulsions
of
some
sort
well
then
a
gale
comes
on
and
rolls
the
whole
o
the
north
atlantic
ocean
against
these
coasts
so
here
you
have
this
part
of
the
gulf
stream
caught
in
another
direction
on
the
port
quarter
as
you
sailors
might
call
it
never
mind
wot
us
sailors
might
call
it
willum
wotever
you
say
on
that
pint
you
sure
to
be
wrong
heave
ahead
well
then
continued
armstrong
with
a
laugh
that
trouble
number
two
and
these
troubles
you
observe
apply
to
the
whole
west
coast
of
both
countries
but
in
the
bay
of
biscay
there
is
still
another
difficulty
for
when
these
rushing
and
tormented
waters
try
to
escape
they
are
met
fair
in
the
face
by
the
whole
north
coast
of
spain
and
thus
sees
it
exclaimed
molloy
with
a
sudden
beam
of
intelligence
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
willum
gulf
stream
flies
at
france
in
a
hot
rage
finds
a
cool
current
or
customer
flowin
down
south
that
shouts
there
at
it
they
go
tooth
an
nail
when
down
comes
a
like
a
wolf
on
the
fold
takes
the
stream
on
the
port
quarter
as
you
say
an
drives
both
it
an
the
cool
customer
into
the
bay
where
the
north
o
spain
cries
heavin
both
o
you
an
drives
back
to
where
the
drivin
on
no
wonder
there
a
mortal
hullaballoo
in
the
bay
o
biscay
why
mate
where
got
ye
all
that
larnin
before
his
friend
could
reply
a
terrific
plunge
of
the
vessel
a
vicious
shriek
of
the
wind
and
the
entrance
of
another
tremendous
sea
suggested
that
the
elements
were
roused
to
unusual
fury
at
having
the
secrets
of
their
operations
thus
ruthlessly
revealed
and
also
suggested
the
propriety
of
the
two
friends
seeking
better
shelter
down
below
while
this
storm
was
raging
miles
lay
in
his
hammock
subjected
to
storms
of
the
bosom
with
occasional
calms
between
he
was
enjoying
one
of
the
calms
when
armstrong
passed
his
hammock
and
asked
how
he
was
getting
on
very
well
willie
soon
be
all
right
i
think
he
replied
with
a
contented
smile
for
at
that
moment
he
had
been
dwelling
on
the
agreeable
fact
that
he
had
really
rescued
marion
drew
from
probable
death
and
that
her
parents
gratefully
recognised
the
service
as
he
learned
from
the
clergyman
himself
who
expressed
his
gratitude
in
the
form
of
frequent
visits
to
and
pleasant
chats
with
the
invalid
the
interest
and
sympathy
which
miles
had
felt
on
first
seeing
this
man
naturally
increased
and
at
last
he
ventured
to
confide
to
him
the
story
of
his
departure
from
home
but
said
nothing
about
the
changed
name
it
is
needless
to
relate
all
that
was
said
on
the
occasion
one
can
easily
imagine
the
bearing
of
a
good
deal
of
it
the
result
on
miles
was
not
very
obvious
at
the
time
but
it
bore
fruit
after
many
days
the
calm
in
our
hero
breast
was
not
however
of
long
duration
the
thought
that
as
a
private
in
a
marching
regiment
he
had
not
the
means
to
maintain
marion
in
the
social
position
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
was
a
very
bitter
thought
and
ruffled
the
sea
of
his
feelings
with
a
stiff
breeze
this
freshened
to
something
like
a
gale
of
rebellion
when
he
reflected
that
his
case
was
all
but
hopeless
for
whatever
might
have
been
the
truth
of
the
statement
regarding
the
french
army
under
napoleon
that
every
soldier
carried
a
marshal
baton
in
his
knapsack
it
did
not
follow
that
soldiers
in
the
british
army
of
the
present
day
carried
commissions
in
knapsacks
indeed
he
knew
it
was
by
no
means
a
common
thing
for
men
to
rise
from
the
ranks
and
he
was
well
aware
that
those
who
did
so
were
elevated
in
virtue
of
qualities
which
he
did
not
possess
he
was
in
the
midst
of
one
of
his
bosom
storms
when
sergeant
hardy
came
to
inquire
how
he
did
somehow
the
quiet
grave
manly
nature
of
that
sergeant
had
a
powerful
effect
not
only
on
miles
but
on
every
one
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
it
was
not
so
much
his
words
as
his
manner
that
commended
him
he
was
curiously
contradictory
so
to
speak
in
character
and
appearance
the
stern
gravity
of
his
countenance
suggested
a
hard
nature
but
lines
of
lurking
about
the
eyes
and
mouth
put
to
flight
the
suggestion
and
acts
of
womanly
tenderness
on
many
occasions
turned
the
scale
the
other
way
a
strong
tall
stiffly
upright
and
frame
led
one
to
look
only
for
elephantine
force
but
when
circumstances
required
prompt
action
our
sergeant
displayed
powers
of
activity
which
were
all
the
more
tremendous
that
they
seemed
incongruous
and
were
unexpected
from
his
lips
you
looked
for
a
voice
of
thunder
and
at
drill
you
were
not
disappointed
but
on
ordinary
occasions
his
speech
was
soft
and
low
bass
indeed
as
to
its
quality
but
never
harsh
or
loud
a
gale
is
brewing
up
from
the
so
jack
molloy
says
remarked
hardy
as
he
was
about
to
pass
on
why
i
thought
it
was
blowing
a
gale
returned
miles
at
least
it
seems
so
if
we
may
judge
from
the
pitching
and
plunging
ah
lad
you
are
judging
from
the
landlubber
returned
the
sergeant
wait
a
bit
and
you
will
understand
better
what
molloy
means
when
he
calls
this
only
a
of
wind
miles
had
not
to
wait
long
the
gale
when
fully
brewed
up
proved
to
be
no
mean
descendant
of
the
family
of
storms
which
have
tormented
the
celebrated
bay
since
the
present
economy
of
nature
began
and
many
of
those
who
were
on
board
of
the
at
that
time
had
their
eyes
opened
and
their
minds
enlarged
as
to
the
nature
of
a
thorough
gale
when
hatches
have
to
be
battened
down
and
the
closed
when
steersmen
have
to
be
fastened
in
their
places
and
the
maddened
sea
seems
to
roar
defiance
to
the
howling
blast
and
all
things
movable
on
deck
are
swept
away
as
if
they
were
straws
and
many
things
not
meant
to
be
movable
are
wrenched
from
their
fastenings
with
a
violence
that
nothing
formed
by
man
can
resist
and
timbers
creak
and
groan
and
loose
furniture
gyrates
about
until
smashed
to
pieces
and
glass
and
crockery
leap
out
of
bounds
to
irrecoverable
ruin
and
even
the
seamen
plunge
about
and
stagger
and
landsmen
hold
on
to
and
or
cling
to
bulkheads
for
dear
life
while
mighty
billows
thundering
hiss
along
the
decks
and
everything
above
below
and
around
seems
being
swept
into
eternity
by
the
besom
of
destruction
but
the
weathered
the
storm
nobly
and
the
good
lord
sent
fine
weather
and
moderate
winds
thereafter
and
ere
long
the
soldiers
were
enjoying
the
sunshine
the
sparkling
waters
and
the
sight
of
the
lovely
shores
of
the
blue
mediterranean
soon
after
that
broken
bones
began
to
mend
and
bruises
to
disappear
and
our
hero
thoroughly
recovered
from
his
accident
as
well
as
greatly
improved
in
general
health
returned
to
his
duties
but
miles
was
not
a
happy
man
for
day
by
day
he
felt
more
and
more
severely
that
he
had
put
himself
in
a
false
position
besides
the
regret
for
having
hastily
forsaken
home
he
had
now
the
bitter
reflection
that
he
had
voluntarily
thrown
away
the
right
to
address
marion
drew
as
an
equal
during
the
whole
voyage
he
had
scarcely
an
opportunity
of
speaking
a
word
to
her
of
course
the
girl
did
not
forget
the
important
service
that
had
been
rendered
to
her
by
the
young
soldier
and
she
took
more
than
one
occasion
to
visit
the
fore
part
of
the
vessel
for
the
purpose
of
expressing
her
gratitude
and
asking
about
his
health
after
he
was
able
to
come
on
deck
but
as
her
father
accompanied
her
on
these
occasions
the
conversation
was
conducted
chiefly
between
him
and
the
reverend
gentleman
still
it
was
some
comfort
to
hear
her
voice
and
see
her
eyes
beaming
kindly
on
him
once
the
youth
inadvertently
expressed
his
feelings
in
his
look
so
that
marion
dropped
and
a
blush
suffused
her
face
to
hide
which
she
instantly
became
unreasonably
interested
in
the
beside
which
they
were
standing
and
wanted
to
understand
principles
of
engineering
which
had
never
troubled
her
before
what
the
use
of
that
curious
machine
she
asked
turning
towards
it
quickly
miss
answered
jack
molloy
who
chanced
to
be
sitting
on
a
spare
yard
close
at
hand
working
a
turk
head
on
a
manrope
that
the
that
is
the
thing
wot
we
uses
we
wants
to
hoist
things
out
o
the
hold
or
lower
into
it
come
marion
we
must
not
keep
our
friend
from
his
duties
said
mr
drew
nodding
pleasantly
to
miles
as
he
turned
away
the
remark
was
called
forth
by
the
fact
that
miles
had
been
arrested
while
on
his
way
to
the
galley
with
a
dish
of
salt
pork
and
with
his
as
usual
tucked
up
only
once
during
the
voyage
did
our
hero
get
the
chance
of
talking
with
marion
alone
the
opportunity
like
most
pieces
of
good
fortune
came
unexpectedly
it
was
on
a
magnificent
night
just
after
the
had
left
malta
the
sea
was
perfectly
calm
yet
affected
by
that
oily
motion
which
has
the
effect
of
breaking
a
reflected
moon
into
a
million
fragments
all
nature
appeared
to
be
hushed
and
the
stars
were
resplendent
it
was
enough
as
jack
molloy
said
to
make
even
a
bad
man
feel
good
do
speak
from
personal
experience
jack
asked
a
comrade
on
that
occasion
i
might
jim
if
was
here
retorted
molloy
but
it
not
easy
to
feel
bad
alongside
o
that
like
a
sword
jack
cuts
two
ways
way
mean
it
way
you
please
as
the
man
said
the
alligator
axed
he
prefer
to
be
chawed
up
or
bolted
whole
concluding
that
on
the
whole
the
conversation
of
his
friends
did
not
tend
to
edification
miles
left
them
and
went
to
one
of
the
starboard
gangways
from
which
he
could
take
a
contemplative
view
of
nature
in
her
beautiful
robe
of
night
curiously
enough
marion
chanced
to
saunter
towards
the
same
gangway
and
unexpectedly
found
him
there
a
lovely
night
mr
miles
she
remarked
miles
started
and
turned
with
slight
confusion
in
his
face
which
happily
the
imperfect
light
concealed
beautiful
indeed
he
exclaimed
thinking
of
the
face
before
him
not
of
the
night
a
cool
beautiful
night
like
this
continued
the
girl
who
was
of
the
romantic
age
of
sixteen
will
remain
long
i
should
think
in
your
memory
and
perhaps
mitigate
in
some
degree
the
hardships
that
are
before
you
on
the
burning
sand
of
egypt
the
memory
of
this
night
returned
miles
with
fervour
will
remain
with
me
it
will
not
only
mitigate
what
you
are
pleased
to
call
hardships
but
will
cause
me
to
forget
them
altogether
forget
nay
that
were
impossible
rejoined
marion
with
a
slight
laugh
for
a
true
soldier
can
not
forget
duty
true
true
said
miles
dubiously
at
least
it
ought
to
be
true
and
i
have
no
doubt
is
so
in
many
cases
but
what
more
he
might
have
said
can
not
now
be
told
for
they
were
interrupted
at
the
moment
by
captain
lacey
who
happening
to
walk
in
that
direction
stopped
and
directed
miss
drew
attention
to
a
picturesque
craft
with
high
lateen
sails
which
had
just
entered
into
the
silver
pathway
of
the
moon
on
the
water
miles
felt
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
in
him
to
remain
or
to
join
in
the
conversation
with
a
heart
full
of
disappointment
and
indignation
he
retired
and
sought
refuge
in
the
darkest
recesses
of
the
pantry
to
which
he
was
welcome
at
all
times
being
a
great
favourite
with
the
steward
whether
it
was
the
smell
of
the
cheese
or
the
ketchup
we
know
not
but
here
better
thoughts
came
over
our
hero
insignificant
causes
often
produce
tremendous
effects
the
touching
of
a
trigger
is
but
a
small
matter
the
effects
of
such
a
touch
are
sometimes
deadly
as
well
as
touching
possibly
the
sugar
if
not
the
cinnamon
may
have
been
an
element
in
his
change
of
mind
at
all
events
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
general
smell
of
groceries
was
associated
with
it
under
the
benign
influence
of
this
change
he
betook
himself
to
the
berth
of
the
chief
with
whom
also
he
was
a
favourite
finding
the
berth
empty
and
a
light
burning
in
it
he
sat
down
to
wait
for
his
friend
the
place
was
comparatively
quiet
and
retired
bethinking
himself
of
the
little
packet
which
he
had
received
at
portsmouth
and
which
still
lay
unopened
in
the
of
his
he
pulled
it
out
besides
a
testament
it
contained
sundry
prettily
covered
booklets
written
by
miss
robinson
and
others
to
interest
the
public
in
our
soldiers
as
well
as
to
amuse
the
soldiers
themselves
in
glancing
through
our
soldiers
and
sailors
institute
memories
our
warfare
the
victory
heaven
light
our
guide
and
similar
works
two
facts
were
suddenly
impressed
upon
his
mind
and
strongly
illuminated
namely
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
living
for
the
good
of
others
and
that
up
to
that
time
he
had
lived
simply
and
solely
for
himself
the
last
sentence
that
had
fallen
from
the
lips
of
marion
that
night
was
also
strongly
impressed
upon
him
a
true
soldier
can
not
forget
duty
and
he
resolved
that
duty
should
be
his
life
watchword
thenceforward
such
is
the
influence
that
a
woman
may
unconsciously
have
over
even
an
unsteady
man
soon
after
this
the
reached
the
end
of
her
voyage

cast
anchor
off
the
coast
of

near
the
city
of
alexandria
chapter
nine
our
hero
meets
a
friend
unexpectedly
in
peculiar
circumstances
and
has
a
very
strange
encounter
miles
milton
first
experience
in
alexandria
was
rather
curious
and
like
most
surprising
things
quite
unlooked
for
the
troops
were
not
permitted
to
land
immediately
on
arrival
but
of
course
no
such
prohibition
lay
on
the
passengers
who
went
off
immediately
in
the
hurry
of
doing
so
the
clergyman
and
his
family
missed
saying
to
miles
who
happened
to
be
on
duty
in
some
remote
part
of
the
vessel
at
the
time
and
the
could
not
be
delayed
this
caused
mr
and
mrs
drew
much
regret
but
we
can
not
add
that
it
caused
the
same
to
miss
drew
because
that
young
lady
possessed
considerable
command
of
feature
and
revealed
no
feeling
at
all
on
the
occasion
miles
was
greatly
disappointed
when
he
found
that
they
had
gone
but
consoled
himself
with
the
hope
that
he
could
make
use
of
his
first
leave
to
find
them
out
in
the
town
and
say
but
why
encourage
hope
thought
miles
to
himself
with
bitterness
in
his
heart
i
only
a
private
marion
will
never
condescend
to
think
of
what
have
i
to
offer
her
except
my
worthless
self
you
see
miles
was
beginning
to
see
through
himself
faintly
even
if
my
father
were
a
rich
man
able
to
buy
me
out
of
the
army
and
leave
me
a
fortune
which
he
is
not
what
right
have
i
to
expect
that
a
girl
like
marion
would
risk
her
happiness
with
a
fellow
who
has
no
profession
no
means
of
subsistence
and
who
has
left
home
without
money
and
without
leave
bah
miles
you
are
about
the
greatest
goose
that
ever
put
on
a
red
coat
he
was
getting
on
you
see
if
he
had
put
sinner
for
goose
his
shot
would
have
been
nearer
the
mark
as
it
was
all
things
considered
it
was
not
a
miss
he
smarted
considerably
under
the
if
a
comrade
had
said
as
much
he
would
have
resented
it
hotly
but
a
man
is
wonderfully
lenient
to
himself
under
the
impulse
of
these
feelings
he
sought
and
obtained
leave
to
go
into
the
town
he
wished
to
see
how
the
new
soldiers
institute
being
set
up
there
was
getting
along
he
had
promised
miss
robinson
to
pay
it
a
visit
that
was
his
plea
he
did
not
feel
called
upon
to
inform
his
officer
of
his
intention
to
visit
the
drews
that
was
quite
a
private
matter
yet
it
was
the
main
matter
for
on
landing
instead
of
inquiring
for
the
spot
where
the
new
institute
was
being
erected
he
began
a
search
among
the
various
hotels
where
english
visitors
were
wont
to
put
up
the
search
was
successful
he
found
the
hotel
but
the
family
had
gone
out
he
was
told
and
were
not
expected
back
till
evening
disappointment
of
course
was
the
result
but
he
would
wait
it
is
amazing
what
an
amount
of
patience
even
impatient
men
will
exercise
when
under
the
influence
of
hope
there
was
plenty
of
time
to
run
down
and
see
the
institute
but
he
might
miss
his
friends
if
they
should
chance
to
come
in
and
go
out
again
during
his
absence
what
should
he
do
bother
the
institute
he
muttered
to
himself
it
only
bricks
mortar
after
all
and
i
do
know
a
soul
there
he
was
wrong
on
both
of
these
points
as
we
shall
see
what
the
use
of
my
going
he
murmured
after
a
reflective
pause
you
promised
the
ladies
of
the
portsmouth
institute
that
you
go
to
see
it
and
report
progress
said
that
extraordinary
something
inside
of
him
which
had
a
most
uncomfortable
way
of
starting
up
and
whispering
when
least
expected
to
do
so
and
added
something
every
gentleman
should
keep
his
word
true
replied
miles
almost
angrily
though
inaudibly
but
i
a
gentleman
i
only
a
private
goose
retorted
that
pertinacious
something
is
not
every
private
a
gentleman
who
acts
like
one
and
is
not
every
gentleman
a
blackguard
who
behaves
as
such
miles
was
silenced
he
gave
in
and
went
off
at
once
to
visit
the
institute
as
he
walked
down
the
long
straight
street
leading
to
the
grand
square
which
had
been
almost
destroyed
by
the
bombardment
he
passed
numerous
dirty
and
wondered
that
english
soldiers
would
condescend
to
enter
such
disgusting
places
he
was
but
a
young
soldier
and
had
yet
to
learn
that
to
men
who
have
been
fairly
overcome
by
the
power
of
the
fiend
strong
drink
no
place
is
too
disgusting
and
no
action
too
mean
so
that
it
but
leads
to
the
gratification
of
their
intolerable
craving
it
is
said
that
in
two
streets
only
there
were
of
these
disreputable
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
passed
him
as
he
went
along
turks
greeks
arabs
negroes
frenchmen
italians
and
englishmen
the
gay
colours
of
whose
picturesque
costumes
lent
additional
brilliancy
to
the
sunny
scene
the
sight
of
the
men
and
veiled
women
of
the
arab
quarter
did
more
however
than
anything
else
to
convince
our
hero
that
he
had
at
last
really
reached
the
east
the
land
of
the
ancient
pharaohs
the
pyramids
the
arabian
nights
entertainments
and
of
modern
contention
presently
he
came
upon
the
piece
of
waste
ground
which
had
been
chosen
as
the
site
of
the
new
institute
it
was
covered
with
the
ruins
shattered
cement
glass
tiles
and
general
wreckage
of
the
buildings
that
had
stood
there
before
the
bombardment
and
on
three
sides
it
was
surrounded
by
heaps
of
stones
shattered
walls
and
rubbish
some
acres
in
extent
but
the
place
had
the
great
advantage
of
being
close
to
the
old
harbour
not
far
from
the
spot
where
ancient
alexandria
stood
and
was
open
to
the
fresh
cooling
breezes
that
came
in
from
the
sea
arab
workmen
were
busily
employed
at
the
time
on
the
foundations
of
the
building
under
the
superintendence
of
an
unmistakable
and
englishman
whose
broad
back
was
presented
to
miles
as
he
approached
turning
suddenly
round
mr
tufnell
the
manager
of
the
portsmouth
institute
confronted
the
visitor
with
a
stern
but
perspiring
visage
which
instantly
became
illuminated
with
a
beaming
smile
what
tufnell
exclaimed
our
hero
in
amazement
ay
miles
as
large
as
life
larger
than
life
if
anything
said
miles
grasping
the
proffered
hand
and
shaking
it
warmly
why
man
the
air
of
egypt
seems
to
magnify
you
more
likely
that
the
heat
of
egypt
is
making
me
grow
what
are
you
rubbing
your
eyes
for
to
make
sure
that
they
do
not
deceive
answered
miles
did
i
not
leave
you
behind
me
at
portsmouth
so
you
did
friend
but
the
voyage
in
a
is
not
the
fastest
method
of
reaching
egypt
as
you
see
i
overshot
you
in
the
race
i
have
come
to
put
up
the
new
building
but
come
to
my
palace
here
and
have
a
talk
and
a
cup
of
coffee
glad
to
see
that
the
voyage
has
agreed
with
you
they
reached
the
palace
to
which
the
manager
referred
and
found
it
to
be
a
cottage
of
corrugated
iron
amidst
the
rubbish
here
said
tufnell
offering
his
friend
a
chair
i
spend
all
my
time
and
reign
supreme
monarch
of
all
i
survey
these
are
my
subjects
he
added
pointing
to
the
arab
workmen
that
wilderness
of
rubbish
is
my
kingdom
and
yon
heap
of
iron
and
stone
is
the
material
out
of
which
we
mean
to
construct
our
alexandria
institute
to
save
time
the
most
valuable
article
in
the
world
if
you
believe
me
miss
robinson
as
perhaps
you
may
have
heard
bought
an
old
iron
edifice
in
london
known
as
the
brompton
oratory
and
sent
it
out
here
like
a
convict
at
government
expense
you
see
not
only
the
public
but
government
have
now
come
to
recognise
the
value
of
her
work
for
soldiers
and
your
subjects
the
arabs
are
they
obedient
and
loyal
asked
miles
pretty
well
but
they
give
me
some
trouble
now
and
then
the
other
day
for
instance
we
had
a
sad
accident
which
at
one
time
i
feared
would
land
us
in
serious
difficulties
it
is
necessary
you
must
know
in
laying
foundations
here
to
dig
through
the
sand
some
twelve
to
fifteen
feet
till
water
is
reached
and
then
we
lay
a
solid
stone
foundation
about
nine
feet
wide
well
while
digging
this
foundation
the
sand
fell
in
on
one
of
the
workmen
i
off
coat
at
once
and
set
to
work
with
a
shovel
shouting
to
the
fellows
to
help
me
instead
of
helping
they
rushed
at
me
in
a
body
to
prevent
my
interfering
in
the
matter
then
they
quarrelled
among
themselves
as
to
the
best
way
of
getting
the
man
out
and
the
result
was
that
the
poor
fellow
was
suffocated
though
he
might
easily
have
been
rescued
by
prompt
action
but
that
was
not
the
end
of
it
the
relations
and
friends
of
the
man
came
down
made
eastern
howling
and
lamentation
over
him
and
laid
his
corpse
at
the
door
of
my
cottage
holding
me
responsible
for
his
life
and
demanding
compensation
and
it
was
not
till
i
had
paid
a
few
francs
to
every
brother
and
cousin
and
relative
belonging
to
him
that
their
grief
was
appeased
and
the
dead
body
carried
away
still
the
matter
did
not
end
here
for
next
day
the
workmen
said
the
accident
was
owing
to
the
omission
of
a
sacrifice
at
the
commencement
of
the
work
and
they
must
have
a
lamb
to
kill
on
the
ground
or
more
lives
would
certainly
be
lost
so
i
bought
them
a
lamb
which
they
duly
killed
cooked
and
ate
after
sprinkling
its
blood
on
the
four
corners
of
the
foundation
and
on
the
walls
i
had
the
skin
of
this
lamb
dressed
and
sent
home
as
a
curiosity
see
note
you
appear
to
have
pretty
rough
times
of
it
then
on
the
whole
said
miles
i
never
counted
on
smooth
times
returned
tufnell
besides
being
used
to
roughing
it
i
am
always
glad
to
do
so
in
a
good
cause
my
palace
as
you
see
is
not
a
bad
one
though
small
it
is
pretty
hot
too
as
you
seem
to
feel
and
they
tell
me
there
will
be
some
interesting
variety
in
my
experiences
when
the
rainy
season
sets
in
i
would
mind
it
so
much
if
i
could
only
be
left
to
sleep
in
peace
at
nights
i
stay
here
you
see
night
and
day
and
what
wi
the
arabs
prowling
around
whispering
and
trying
to
get
in
and
the
wild
dogs
makin
the
neighbourhood
a
place
o
public
meeting
barking
howling
and
quarrelling
over
their
sorrows
like
human
bein
they
do
give
me
much
rest
i
have
read
of
these
dogs
before
said
miles
are
they
really
as
wild
and
dangerous
as
they
get
credit
for
if
you
seen
the
fight
i
had
wi
them
the
other
night
you
have
no
doubt
on
that
point
why
a
gang
of
made
a
regular
attack
on
me
and
if
it
had
been
that
i
was
pretty
active
with
my
they
have
torn
me
in
bits
let
me
advise
you
never
to
go
out
after
nightfall
without
one
is
that
one
in
your
hand
no
it
is
merely
a
cane
well
exchange
with
me
there
no
saying
when
you
may
want
it
tufnell
took
a
light
which
lay
on
the
table
and
handed
it
to
miles
who
accepted
it
laughingly
and
without
the
slightest
belief
that
he
should
ever
have
occasion
to
use
it
in
chatting
about
the
plans
of
the
building
and
the
prospects
of
success
our
hero
became
at
last
so
deeply
interested
partly
no
doubt
because
of
his
friend
enthusiasm
that
he
forgot
the
flight
of
time
and
the
evening
was
advancing
before
he
rose
to
leave
now
tufnell
he
said
suddenly
i
must
be
off
i
have
another
call
of
importance
to
make
what
wo
you
stop
and
have
a
cup
of
coffee
with
me
impossible
my
business
is
urgent
i
want
to
see
friends
whom
i
may
not
have
the
chance
of
seeing
again
then
and
have
a
care
of
the
dogs
specially
after
nightfall
on
returning
to
the
hotel
shortly
after
sunset
miles
came
to
the
conclusion
that
his
love
must
certainly
be
true
for
its
course
was
not
running
smooth
his
friends
had
not
yet
returned
mrs
drew
had
indeed
come
back
alone
in
a
cab
but
she
had
von
headik
an
vas
go
to
the
bed
waiting
about
in
front
of
the
hotel
for
an
hoar
or
two
proved
to
be
too
much
for
our
hero
nerves
he
therefore
made
up
his
mind
to
exhaust
his
nervous
system
by
means
of
a
smart
walk
soon
he
found
himself
in
a
lonely
place
between
the
grand
square
and
the
ramleh
gate
with
a
deliciously
cool
breeze
playing
on
his
brow
and
a
full
moon
sailing
overhead
no
one
was
moving
about
on
the
road
along
which
he
walked
he
had
it
all
to
himself
at
first
and
the
evening
would
have
been
quiet
as
well
as
beautiful
but
for
the
yelping
dogs
which
had
by
that
time
come
out
of
their
to
search
and
fight
for
food
and
hold
their
nightly
revels
all
round
him
were
the
heaps
of
rubbish
caused
by
bombardment
and
the
ruined
houses
which
war
had
rendered
tenantless
though
here
and
there
the
uprising
of
new
buildings
proved
that
the
indomitable
energy
of
man
was
not
to
be
quelled
by
war
or
anything
else
a
flickering
placed
here
and
there
at
intervals
threw
a
sickly
yellow
light
into
dark
recesses
which
the
moonbeams
failed
to
reach
intermingled
with
these
were
a
few
and
bananas
after
a
time
he
observed
a
couple
of
figures
in
advance
of
him
a
man
and
woman
walking
slowly
in
the
same
direction
not
wishing
to
have
his
thoughts
disturbed
he
pushed
on
intending
to
pass
the
wayfarers
he
had
got
to
within
a
hundred
paces
of
them
when
he
became
aware
of
a
violent
pattering
sound
behind
him
stopping
and
looking
back
he
saw
a
pack
of
eight
or
nine
of
the
wild
dogs
of
the
place
coming
along
the
road
at
full
gallop
he
was
quite
aware
that
they
were
the
savage
masterless
creatures
which
keep
close
in
hiding
during
the
day
and
come
out
at
night
to
search
for
something
to
devour
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
any
sort
of
dog
was
a
dangerous
animal
he
therefore
merely
looked
at
them
with
interest
as
being
natives
of
the
place
they
passed
without
taking
notice
of
him
as
ugly
and
wolfish
a
pack
as
one
could
wish
to
see
led
by
a
big
fellow
like
a
ragged
disreputable
collie
they
also
passed
with
apparent
indifference
the
wayfarers
in
advance
who
had
stopped
to
look
at
them
suddenly
and
without
a
note
of
warning
the
whole
pack
turned
and
rushed
back
yelling
fiercely
towards
the
man
and
woman
the
latter
clung
to
the
left
arm
of
the
former
who
raised
his
stick
and
brought
it
down
with
such
on
the
skull
of
the
foremost
dog
that
it
reeled
back
with
an
angry
howl
it
was
not
cowed
however
for
it
came
on
again
but
the
man
instead
of
striking
it
thrust
the
end
of
his
stick
down
its
throat
and
checked
it
a
second
time
still
unsubdued
the
fierce
animal
flew
at
him
once
more
and
would
certainly
have
overcome
him
if
miles
had
not
run
to
the
rescue
at
the
first
sign
of
attack
coming
up
quickly
he
brought
his
cane
down
on
the
dog
head
with
all
his
might
having
quite
forgotten
the
sword
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
the
blow
did
nothing
to
the
dog
but
it
shattered
the
cane
leaving
the
sword
exposed
this
was
fortunate
a
quick
thrust
sent
the
dog
flying
away
with
yells
of
pain
and
fear
followed
by
all
his
companions
who
seemed
to
take
their
cue
entirely
from
their
leader
turning
to
congratulate
the
wayfarers
on
their
escape
miles
confronted
mr
drew
and
his
daughter
marion
if
he
had
encountered
the
glare
of
the
great
he
could
scarcely
have
been
taken
more
completely
aback
my
dear
young
friend
said
the
clergyman
recovering
himself
and
grasping
the
passive
hand
of
the
young
soldier
with
enthusiasm
though
he
could
not
help
smiling
at
his
obvious
embarrassment
you
seem
to
have
been
raised
up
to
be
our
rescuer
i
hope
i
have
been
raised
up
for
something
even
more
satisfactory
than
that
thought
miles
but
he
did
not
say
so
what
he
did
say
in
a
stammering
fashion
was
to
the
effect
that
he
hoped
he
might
be
called
on
to
to
render
many
more
such
trifling
services
no
he
did
not
quite
mean
that
but
they
should
ever
again
be
in
danger
he
hoped
they
would
call
on
him
to
to
that
is
but
i
hope
sincerely
he
added
changing
the
subject
abruptly
that
you
are
not
hurt
miss
drew
oh
dear
no
only
a
little
frightened
but
father
are
you
sure
that
are
not
hurt
quite
sure
only
a
little
sprain
i
think
or
twist
in
my
right
ankle
the
attack
was
so
sudden
you
see
that
in
the
hurry
to
meet
it
my
foot
turned
over
give
me
your
arm
my
young
friend
there
it
will
be
all
right
in
a
few
minutes
how
you
tremble
marion
your
nerves
have
received
a
greater
shock
than
you
imagine
and
a
lame
man
is
but
a
poor
support
give
her
your
other
arm
mr
miles
you
are
stout
enough
to
support
us
both
stout
enough
to
support
them
both
ay
at
that
moment
miles
felt
stout
enough
to
support
the
entire
world
like
atlas
on
his
own
broad
shoulders
with
a
blush
that
the
moon
generously
refused
to
reveal
marion
laid
her
hand
lightly
on
the
soldier
arm
it
was
much
too
light
a
touch
and
did
not
distribute
with
fairness
the
weight
of
his
burden
for
the
old
gentleman
hung
heavily
on
the
other
arm
mr
drew
walked
very
slowly
and
with
evident
pain
for
the
twist
of
the
ankle
had
been
much
more
severe
than
he
at
first
imagined
you
will
come
in
and
sup
with
us
said
mr
drew
on
at
last
reaching
the
hotel
door
impossible
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
but
my
time
has
almost
expired
indeed
i
fear
it
has
expired
already
and
duty
comes
before
everything
else
your
daughter
taught
me
that
lesson
sir
on
board
ship
oh
you
hypocrite
remarked
his
familiar
and
internal
friend
where
was
this
grand
sense
of
duty
when
you
left
home
in
a
rage
without
your
leave
to
father
or
mother
miles
could
make
no
reply
he
had
a
tendency
to
silence
when
this
friend
spoke
and
returned
to
barracks
in
a
pensive
mood
just
in
time
as
armstrong
said
to
save
his
bacon
note
this
fleece
is
now
among
other
curiosities
at
the
portsmouth
institute
chapter
ten
off
to
the
wars
the
troops
sent
out
to
egypt
at
that
time
were
much
wanted
to
reinforce
the
southern
frontier
and
defend
it
from
the
attacks
of
osman
digna
who
with
a
large
host
of
the
dusky
warriors
of
the
soudan
was
giving
the
defenders
much
trouble
and
keeping
them
incessantly
on
the
miles
milton
had
no
time
while
in
alexandria
for
anything
but
duty
he
saw
marion
only
once
again
before
leaving
but
did
not
find
an
opportunity
to
converse
with
her
alone
to
do
him
justice
he
had
not
the
most
distant
intention
of
declaring
the
state
of
his
feelings
even
if
the
opportunity
had
been
given
he
merely
desired
to
be
in
her
company
for
a
little
on
any
terms
whatever
on
that
occasion
however
he
contrived
to
scorch
his
heart
with
a
double
dose
of
jealousy
for
he
found
two
young
men
visiting
the
clergyman
each
of
whom
seemed
to
be
a
friend
of
the
family
one
was
a
spendthrift
named
rentworth
a
young
traveller
of
that
loose
type
which
is
occasionally
met
with
in
foreign
parts
squandering
the
money
of
a
rich
father
he
was
a
decidedly
handsome
young
fellow
but
with
the
stamp
of
dissipation
already
on
his
countenance
the
other
was
a
telegraph
engineer
with
honesty
and
in
every
line
of
his
plain
countenance
both
of
these
youths
paid
marked
attention
to
marion
at
least
miles
thought
so
and
he
hated
them
both
accordingly
all
the
more
that
he
their
eyes
to
be
fixed
upon
him
while
he
was
bidding
her
farewell
he
did
not
say
that
was
too
commonplace
in
the
circumstances
almost
childish
there
was
one
gleam
of
comfort
in
the
fact
however
that
marion
echoed
the
word
and
that
he
thought
indeed
he
was
sure
her
hand
trembled
slightly
as
she
returned
or
rather
received
his
squeeze
miles
was
very
stern
of
countenance
and
remarkably
upright
in
figure
while
these
adieux
were
being
said
for
the
glare
of
his
rivals
he
thought
was
upon
him
how
the
poor
fellow
got
through
the
preparations
and
packing
and
parades
that
were
necessary
when
the
order
came
abruptly
for
the
regiment
to
start
for
suez
we
can
not
tell
he
went
about
everything
mechanically
or
like
a
man
in
a
dream
and
it
was
not
till
they
had
fairly
started
in
the
railway
train
that
he
became
alive
to
the
serious
fact
that
he
was
actually
off
to
the
wars
the
accommodation
for
passengers
in
that
train
was
not
good
distinctly
bad
indeed
would
be
the
proper
term
to
apply
to
the
kind
of
in
which
miles
found
himself
with
a
detachment
of
the
gallant
infantry
and
soon
the
blinding
dust
of
egypt
reminded
our
young
soldier
that
the
real
battle
of
life
had
fairly
begun
you
get
over
it
in
time
my
poor
fellow
said
his
friend
armstrong
who
sat
beside
him
you
need
the
same
consolation
yourself
friend
willie
retorted
miles
wiping
the
dust
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
i
did
mean
returned
his
friend
know
what
i
mean
but
cheer
up
absence
makes
the
heart
grow
fonder
at
the
same
time
it
makes
a
fellow
fit
for
duty
i
have
gone
through
it
myself
and
know
all
about
it
miles
flushed
and
felt
inclined
at
first
to
resent
this
allusion
to
the
state
of
his
affections
but
he
was
fortunately
saved
from
taking
any
notice
of
it
by
a
sudden
burst
of
laughter
among
the
men
at
a
remark
from
corporal
flynn
who
although
this
was
his
first
visit
to
egypt
had
undertaken
to
point
out
to
his
comrades
the
various
localities
which
he
chose
to
assume
were
more
or
less
connected
with
scripture
history
the
first
part
of
the
journey
was
not
particularly
interesting
and
what
with
the
fine
sand
and
the
great
heat
the
men
began
to
experience
the
discomforts
of
an
eastern
climate
and
to
make
frequent
application
to
their
it
would
have
been
well
if
they
had
contented
themselves
with
water
and
with
the
cold
tea
which
some
of
them
had
been
provident
enough
to
save
up
at
breakfast
but
when
they
reached
the
first
station
where
there
was
a
five
minutes
halt
some
of
them
managed
to
smuggle
strong
drink
into
the
train
one
immediate
result
was
that
the
men
became
more
noisy
come
give
us
a
song
gaspard
cried
several
voices
apparently
inspired
at
the
same
moment
with
the
same
idea
and
desire
wan
wid
a
rousin
chorus
boy
cried
flynn
gaspard
complied
being
ever
ready
to
oblige
but
whether
it
was
the
heat
or
the
dust
or
the
rousin
chorus
or
the
drink
the
song
was
a
partial
failure
perhaps
it
was
the
excess
of
induced
by
the
motion
of
the
train
at
all
events
it
fell
flat
and
when
finished
a
hilarious
man
named
simkin
or
rattling
bill
struck
up
rule
britannia
which
more
than
made
amends
for
the
other
and
was
sung
with
intense
vigour
till
the
next
station
was
reached
here
more
drink
was
smuggled
on
board
the
train
and
as
a
natural
consequence
men
became
troublesome
a
morose
man
named
sutherland
who
was
apt
to
grow
argumentative
and
quarrelsome
in
his
cups
made
an
assertion
in
reference
to
something
terrestrial
which
had
no
particular
interest
for
any
mortal
man
simkin
contradicted
it
sutherland
repeated
it
simkin
knocked
sutherland
helmet
overboard
sutherland
returned
the
compliment
in
kind
and
their
comrades
had
to
quell
an
intestine
war
while
the
lost
were
left
on
the
arid
plain
where
they
were
last
seen
surrounded
by
and
natives
of
the
flamingo
tribe
this
loss
was
a
serious
one
for
exposure
of
the
head
to
the
sun
in
such
a
climate
is
exceedingly
dangerous
and
the
old
hands
had
great
difficulty
in
impressing
the
fact
on
rattling
bill
and
sutherland
who
with
the
obstinacy
of
greenhorns
made
light
of
the
danger
and
expressed
disbelief
in
sunstroke
of
course
considerable
interest
was
manifested
when
the
station
of
was
reached

from
this

but
it
is

that
the
egyptians
were
brave
enough
and
fought

they
were
fairly

the
response
was
prompt
and
hearty
and
for
a
few
moments
a
forest
of
white
helmets
waved
in
the
air
the
enthusiasm
was
not
allowed
to
cool
for
the
next
station
was

where
the
life
guards
and
our
cavalry
made
their
midnight
charges
and
where
there
occurred
perhaps
one
of
the
longest
fighting
in
the
war
of
here
also
they
saw
the
graves
of
the
poor
fellows
who
fell
at
that
time
but
the
sight
did
not
depress
the
men
much
the
somewhat
lugubrious
sutherland
alone
seemed
to
take
a
serious
view
of
such
matters
it

said
miles
as
he
gazed
with
unusual
interest
on
this
wonderful
highway
of
nations
the
troops
reached
suez
after
a
ten
hours
journey
the
distance
being
about
miles
our
hero
made
the
acquaintance
here
of
a
private
of
marines
named
stevenson
with
whom
he
afterwards
served
in
the
soudan
and
with
whom
he
became
very
friendly
not
only
because
their
spirits
were
sympathetic
but
because
having
been
brought
up
in
the
same
part
of
england
they
had
similar
memories
and
associations
in
regard
to
home
only
those
who
have
wandered
long
and
far
from
their
native
land
can
understand
the
attractive
influence
that
arises
between
men
who
meet
abroad
and
find
that
they
can
chat
about
the
same
places
and
persons
in
the
old
country
it
was
saturday
when
the
troops
arrived
at
suez
and
the
heavy
dew
that
fell
rendered
the
night
bitterly
cold
and
felt
to
be
so
all
the
more
because
of
the
intense
heat
of
the
day
sunday
began
with
rousing
out
at
six
breakfast
at
seven
parade
at
eight
and
divine
service
thereafter
as
there
was
no
clergyman
at
the
place
at
the
time
the
duty
was
performed
by
one
of
the
officers
doubtless
among
the
officers
there
are
men
who
not
only
can
read
prayers
well
but
who
have
the
spirit
of
prayer
in
them
that
such
however
is
not
always
the
case
may
be
gathered
from
the
remark
of
one
of
the
men
upon
this
occasion
you
know
tom
said
this
rather
severe
critic
to
his
comrade
confidentially
there
one
advantage
in
fast
readin
that
it
gets
the
business
soon
over
which
is
some
sort
o
comfort
to
fellows
that
has
got
to
attend
whether
they
like
it
or
not
hot
or
cold
fresh
or
tired
unless
dooty
prevents
but
the
hofficer
that
did
dooty
seemed
to
me
to
made
a
wager
to
read
the
prayers
against
time
an
that
can
do
no
good
at
all
to
any
one
you
know
far
better
in
my
opinion
to
no
service
at
all
no
wonder
men
wo
listen
why
it
a
mockery
that
what
it
is
a
walk
round
suez
with
armstrong
and
stevenson
till
tattoo
at
finished
the
day
and
convinced
miles
and
his
friends
that
the
sooner
they
bade
adieu
to
that
place
the
better
for
all
of
them
their
wishes
were
gratified
almost
sooner
than
they
wished
chapter
eleven
new
and
sad
mingled
with
curious
experiences
at
suez
miles
milton
first
made
acquaintance
with
the
shady
side
of
war
before
the
commanding
officer
after
parade
next
morning
they
received
marching
orders
and
followed
in
the
afternoon
the
steamer
came
in
from
suakim
with
sick
wounded
and
invalids
and
a
large
party
was
told
off
to
assist
in
landing
them
and
their
baggage
miles
was
one
of
the
party
the
dock
where
the
vessel
lay
was
three
miles
off
and
the
greater
part
of
this
distance
the
invalids
were
brought
by
train
but
the
latter
part
of
the
journey
had
to
be
done
on
foot
by
those
who
could
walk
and
on
stretchers
by
those
who
could
not
oh
it
was
pitiful
to
see
those
battered
sunburnt
bloodless
young
men
with
deep
lines
of
suffering
on
their
faces
aged
before
their
time
and
the
mere
wrecks
of
what
they
once
were
men
who
had
gone
to
that
region
strong
active
ruddy
enthusiastic
and
who
after
a
few
months
returned
thus
feeble
and
shattered
some
irreparably
so
others
with
perhaps
years
of
joyless
life
before
them
a
few
with
the
unmistakable
stamp
of
death
already
on
their
brows
there
were
about
forty
altogether
some
as
we
have
said
were
carried
from
the
vessel
and
not
one
of
the
forlorn
band
could
get
on
without
the
assistance
of
their
fresh
comrades
from
england
one
tall
young
soldier
who
must
have
been
a
splendid
specimen
of
manhood
when
he
landed
in
egypt
was
supported
on
one
side
by
miles
and
on
the
other
by
stevenson
halt
a
moment
said
the
invalid
in
a
weak
voice
and
with
an
apologetic
smile
i
i
ca
get
along
quite
as
fast
as
i
used
to
his
trembling
legs
and
bowed
back
did
not
require
the
tongue
or
the
large
sunken
eyes
to
confirm
that
obvious
truth
poor
fellow
said
miles
with
difficulty
owing
to
the
lump
in
his
throat
you
ought
to
have
had
a
stretcher
here
sit
down
a
bit
on
this
stone
have
you
been
wounded
ay
returned
the
man
with
a
look
of
quiet
resignation
that
seemed
to
have
become
habitual
to
him
i
have
been
wounded
but
not
by
spear
or
bullet
it
the
climate
that
has
done
for
me
i
used
to
think
that
nothing
under
the
sun
could
quell
me
but
the
lord
has
seen
fit
to
bring
down
my
pride
in
that
matter
at
the
same
time
it
only
fair
to
say
that
he
has
also
raised
me
up
and
given
me
greater
blessings
than
he
has
taken
away
they
told
me
in
portsmouth
that
he
would
and
it
has
come
true
at
the
institute
asked
stevenson
eagerly
ay
the
soldiers
institute
answered
the
invalid
god
bless
you
returned
the
marine
grasping
his
hand
it
was
there
i
was
brought
to
god
myself
cheer
up
brother
you
soon
be
in
hospital
where
good
food
an
physic
an
nursing
will
bring
you
round
an
make
you
as
as
ever
it
may
be
so
if
he
wills
it
so
returned
the
trooper
softly
but
i
have
a
little
book
called
warfare
and
a
letter
from
the
friend
in
my
pocket
which
has
done
me
more
good
than
all
the
hospitals
and
physic
in
egypt
can
do
come
let
us
go
on
better
now
rising
and
putting
a
long
arm
round
the
shoulders
of
each
of
his
new
friends
the
trooper
slowly
brought
up
the
rear
of
the
touching
procession
which
had
already
passed
them
on
its
way
to
suez
in
the
vessel
which
had
brought
those
unfortunate
men
from
suakim
miles
and
his
comrades
soon
found
themselves
advancing
down
that
region
of
sweltering
heat
called
the
red
sea
the
sight
of
the
disabled
men
had
naturally
at
first
a
depressing
effect
on
the
men
but
the
influence
of
robust
health
youth
strong
hope
and
that
courage
which
makes
the
british
soldier
so
formidable
to
his
foes
soon
restored
to
most
of
them
their
wonted
enjoyment
of
the
present
and
disregard
for
the
future
even
the
serving
out
of
and
failed
to
allay
their
exuberant
spirits
the
although
doubtless
a
good
ship
for
carrying
coals
was
very
to
convey
troops
but
in
times
of
war
and
in
distant
lands
soldiers
lay
their
account
with
roughing
it
they
soon
found
that
a
little
of
the
physic
which
is
supposed
to
be
rough
on
rats
would
have
been
of
advantage
for
the
very
first
night
many
of
the
men
were
awakened
by
those
creatures
nibbling
at
their
toes
everything
on
board
was
dirty
the
tin
pannikins
were
rusty
the
biscuit
was
mouldy
and
full
of
creatures
that
the
captain
called
weevils
and
macleod
styled
some
of
the
biscuit
was
so
bad
that
it
had
to
be
thrown
away
and
the
remainder
eaten
as
moses
said
with
closed
eyes
it
an
ill
wind
that
blaws
naebody
guid
said
macleod
to
moses
pyne
as
he
came
on
deck
to
enjoy
a
pipe
after
their
first
dinner
on
board
what
think
that
queer
cratur
flynn
is
doin
doon
below
nothing
very
useful
i

said
moses
ye
wrang
for
ance
he
lyin
in

there
makin

on

ay
an
he
killed
twa
or
three
you
do
say
so
i
go
and
see
the
fun
so
saying
moses
went
below
but
had
just
reached
the
foot
of
the
ladder
when
a
boot
caught
him
violently
on
the
shins
hi
hallo
ho
shouted
moses
och
git
out
o
the
line
o
fire
wid
ye
there
another
growled
flynn
as
he
fired
a
second
boot
which
whizzed
past
the
intruder
and
a
sharp
squeak
told
that
it
had
not
been
fired
in
vain
moses
beat
a
hasty
retreat
and
the
irishman
continued
the
fight
with
that
indomitable
perseverance
for
which
his
countrymen
are
famous
there
is
no
saying
how
long
the
action
would
have
lasted
but
in
his
energy
he
knocked
away
the
support
of
a
shelf
behind
him
and
a
small
cask
of
large
nails
taking
him
in
rear
sent
him
sprawling
on
the
deck
and
routed
him
this
misadventure
did
not
however
terminate
the
war
on
the
contrary
became
a
favourite
pastime
during
the
voyage
down
the
red
sea
our
hero
of
course
took
his
turn
at
the
fighting
but
we
believe
that
he
never
received
a
medal
for
his
share
in
that
war
they
spent
one
sunday
on
the
deep
but
the
only
record
made
of
it
in
the
journal
of
the
soldier
from
which
most
of
our
facts
are
gathered
is
that
they
had
prayers
in
racing
style
against
time
as
if
to
cleanse
themselves
from
the
impropriety
of
this
act
the
soldiers
had
a
grand
washing
of
clothes
on
the
following
day
and
the
day
after
that
they
arrived
at
suakim
it
is
what
i
call
a
dreary
town
said
miles
to
armstrong
as
they
approached
might
be
worse
replied
his
friend
ye
aye
tak
a
cheery
view
o
things
airmstrong
an
what
for
no
asked
sutherland
you
may
well
ask
why
not
said
sergeant
hardy
i
think
it
wisest
to
look
always
on
the
bright
side
of
things
whether
it
dreary
or
pleasant
we
have
to
make
the
best
we
can
of
it
boys
said
stevenson
for
this
is
to
be
our
home
for
some
time
to
come
horrible
growled
simkin
whose
spirit
was
essentially
rebellious
ochone
sighed
flynn
who
we
need
scarcely
say
was
essentially
jolly
further
remark
was
cut
short
by
the
voice
of
captain
lacey
ordering
the
men
to
fall
in
as
the
colonel
in
command
was
coming
on
board
to
inspect
them
the
night
of
the
arrival
of
the
was
dreadfully
hot
insomuch
that
many
of
the
men
found
it
impossible
to
sleep
but
in
the
silence
of
that
night
food
for
reflection
was
supplied
to
the
wakeful
in
the
form
of
sounds
that
were
new
to
many
but
soon
became
familiar
to
all
namely
the
boom
of
big
guns
and
the
rattle
of
musketry
osman
digna
was
making
one
of
his
customary
attacks
on
the
town
and
the
defenders
were
repelling
him
of
course
the
sanguine
among
the
new
arrivals
were
much
excited
and
eager
to
join
in
the
fray
but
their
services
were
not
required
that
night
osman
and
his
dusky
hordes
were
being
repulsed
as
usual
and
the
reinforcements
were
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
merely
listening
to
the
sounds
of
war
chapter
twelve
in
action
at
last
no
time
was
lost
in
sending
the
troops
to
their
sphere
of
duty
there
was
something
appropriate
in
their
landing
on
that
day
of
gunpowdery
memories
the
of
november
it
was
four
when
they
disembarked
by
they
were
drawn
up
and
inspected
by
the
general
and
immediately
thereafter
marched
off
in
detachments
to
their
respective
stations
to
sphinx
redoubt
fort
commodore
bulimba
and
other
points
of
defence
the
detachment
in
which
miles
milton
found
himself
was
led
by
captain
lacey
to
sphinx
redoubt
where
he
was
greatly
pleased
to
find
that
his
new
friend
private
stevenson
of
the
marines
was
also
stationed
with
some
of
his
comrades
there
are
probably
times
in
the
experiences
of
most
of
us
when
we
seem
to
awake
out
of
a
long
dream
and
begin
to
appreciate
fully
that
the
circumstances
in
which
we
are
placed
are
stern
realities
after
all
such
a
time
of
awakening
came
to
our
hero
when
he
and
his
comrades
each
received
fifty
rounds
of
and
stood
ready
to
repel
assault
on
the
defences
of
suakim
hitherto
drill
and
reviews
had
seemed
to
him
a
good
deal
like
playing
at
soldiers
even
when
the
distant
sound
of
the
big
guns
and
the
rattle
of
small
arms
touched
his
ear
the
slumber
of
unbelief
was
only
broken
not
quite
dispelled
but
now
weighted
with
the
deadly
missiles
with
rifle
in
hand
with
ears
alert
to
every
sound
and
eyes
open
to
every
object
that
might
present
itself
on
the
sandy
waste
beyond
the
redoubt
and
a
general
feeling
of
expectancy
pervading
his
thoughts
and
feelings
he
became
clearly
convinced
that
the
recent
past
was
no
flight
of
the
imagination
that
he
was
in
very
truth
a
soldier
and
that
his
fighting
career
had
in
reality
begun
now
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
here
to
state
that
our
hero
was
not
by
nature
a
combative
man
we
think
it
necessary
to
point
this
out
because
the
somewhat
pugnacious
introduction
of
miles
into
our
story
may
have
misled
the
reader
on
this
point
his
desire
for
a
soldier
life
was
founded
on
a
notion
that
it
would
prove
to
be
a
roving
jovial
hilarious
sort
of
life
with
plenty
of
sport
and
adventure
in
foreign
lands
of
course
he
knew
that
it
implied
fighting
also
and
he
was
quite
ready
for
that
when
it
should
be
required
of
him
but
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
reflect
very
profoundly
that
soldiering
also
meant
in
some
instances
exposure
to
withering
heat
during
the
day
and
stifling
heat
during
the
night
to
thirst
that
seems
unquenchable
and
fatigue
from
prolonged
duty
that
seems
irreparable
to
fits
of
sickness
that
appear
to
eliminate
from
stalwart
frames
all
the
strength
they
had
ever
possessed
and
fits
of
the
blues
that
render
the
termination
of
life
a
subject
of
rather
pleasant
contemplation
than
otherwise
but
all
these
things
he
found
out
at
suakim
moreover
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
to
think
deeply
on
the
fact
that
fighting
meant
rushing
at
a
whose
acquaintance
he
had
not
made
before
against
whom
he
had
not
the
slightest
feeling
of
and
skewering
him
with
a
bayonet
or
sending
a
bullet
into
him
which
would
terminate
his
career
in
and
leave
a
wife
and
children
perhaps
a
mother
also
disconsolate
but
he
also
found
that
out
at
suakim
we
repeat
that
miles
had
no
desire
to
fight
though
of
course
he
had
no
objection
when
the
officer
in
command
sent
him
and
his
comrades
to
their
station
after
the
supply
just
referred
to
and
told
them
to
keep
a
sharp
for
osman
digna
was
giving
them
a
great
deal
of
trouble
at
the
time
and
pointed
out
where
they
were
to
go
if
attacked
and
warned
them
to
be
ready
to
turn
out
on
the
instant
that
the
bugle
should
sound
the
alarm
miles
was
as
full
of
energy
and
determination
to
fight
and
die
for
his
country
as
the
best
of
his
comrades
though
he
did
not
express
so
strong
a
wish
for
a
brush
with
the
enemy
as
some
of
them
did
or
sympathise
much
with
corporal
flynn
when
he
said
it
wishin
i
am
that
osman
an
his
dirty
naygurs
would

himself
polishing

to

an
lively

we
niver

o

as
he
spoke
a
tremendous
explosion
not
far
off
caused
the
redoubt
to
tremble
to
its
foundations
at
the
same
moment
the
alarm
sounded
the
men
sprang
up
seized
their
arms
and
stood
ready
for
an
attack
but
to
their
surprise
no
attack
was
made
surely
it
must
have
been
one
of
the
mines
you
were
telling
me
about
said
miles
in
a
low
voice
to
sergeant
gilroy
who
stood
near
to
him
it
was
one
of
them
unquestionably
for
a
corporal
of
the
berkshire
regiment
told
me
lieutenant
young
placed
the
mine
there
yesterday
while
gilroy
was
speaking
lieutenant
young
himself
came
along
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
with
captain
lacey
and
stood
still
close
beside
miles
what
puzzles
me
is
that
they
have
not
followed
it
up
with
a
few
volleys
according
to
their
usual
custom
said
the
former
in
a
low
voice
luckily
they
seldom
do
any
harm
for
they
are
uncommonly
bad
shots
but
they
generally
try
their
best
to
do
us
mischief
and
always
make
a
good
deal
of
noise
about
it
perhaps
suggested
captain
lacey
your
mine
has
done
so
much
execution
this
time
and
killed
so
many
men
that
they
got
a
fright
and
run
away
it
may
be
so
but
i
think
not
the
soudanese
are
not
easily
frightened
as
we
have
some
cause
to
know
have
you
many
mines
about
asked
the
captain
yes
we
have
a
good
many
and
they
form
a
most
important
part
of
our
defence
for
we
are
not
very
well
supplied
with
men
and
the
egyptian
troops
are
not
to
be
depended
on
unless
backed
up
by
ours
these
mines
require
to
be
carefully
handled
however
for
our
shepherds
take
the
cattle
out
to
graze
every
day
so
that
if
i
were
to
fail
to
disconnect
any
of
them
in
the
mornings
we
should
have
some
of
our
cattle
blown
up
and
if
i
failed
to
connect
them
again
at
night
the
enemy
would
attack
us
more
vigorously
as
it
is
they
are
very
nervous
about
the
mines
they
have
pluck
to
face
any
foe
that
they
can
see
but
the
idea
of
an
unseen
foe
who
lurks
underground
anywhere
and
may
suddenly
send
them
into
the
sky
like
rockets
daunts
them
a
bit
and
little
wonder
returned
the
captain
from
what
you
say
i
judge
that
you
have
the
management
of
most
of
the
mines
of
all
of
them
answered
the
lieutenant
with
a
modest
look
there
was
more
than
modesty
in
this
young
officer
of
engineers
there
was
heroism
also
he
might
have
added
though
he
did
not
that
this
duty
of
connecting
and
disconnecting
the
mines
each
night
and
morning
was
such
a
dangerous
service
that
he
declined
to
take
men
out
with
him
and
invariably
did
the
work
personally
and
alone
the
mystery
of
the
explosion
on
the
night
we
write
of
was
explained
next
morning
when
a
party
sallied
forth
to
see
what
damage
had
been
done
they
found
instead
of
dismembered
men
the
remnants
of
a
poor
little
hare
which
had
strayed
across
the
fatal
line
of
danger
and
been
blown
to
atoms
thus
do
the
lives
of
the
innocent
too
often
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
misdeeds
of
the
guilty
next
night
however
the
defenders
were
roused
by
a
real
attack
the
day
had
been
one
of
the
most
trying
that
the
new
arrivals
had
yet
experienced
the
seasoned
men
who
had
been
formed
by
nature
apparently
of
indestructible
material
said
it
was
awful
the
thermometer
stood
at
above
degrees
in
the
shade
there
was
not
a
breath
of
air
moving
the
men
were
panting
almost
choking
even
the
negroes
groaned
and
drawing
brackish
water
from
a
well
in
the
fort
poured
it
over
their
heads
and
bodies
but
with
little
benefit
for
the
water
itself
was
between
and
degrees
it
try
some
o
the
if
i
not
mistaken
remarked
one
of
the
indestructible
men
above
referred
to
as
he
rose
from
dinner
and
proceeded
to
fill
his
pipe
why
think
so
asked
sergeant
hardy
whose
name
was
appropriate
for
he
continued
for
a
long
time
to
be
one
of
the
indestructibles
it
always
like
this
when
we
goin
to
have
a
horrible
night
do
the
nights
vary
much
asked
armstrong
who
was
still
busy
with
his
knife
and
fork
of
course
they
do
returned
the
man
sometimes
you
have
it
quite
chilly
after
a
hot
day
other
times
you
have
it
suffocatin
like
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
as
it
be
what
sort
o
hole
was
that
asked
simkin
whose
knowledge
of
history
was
not
extensive
it
was
a
small
room
or
prison
into
which
they
stuffed
a
lot
of
our
men
once
in
india
in
awful
hot
weather
an
kep
them
there
waitin
till
the
great
mogul
or
some
chap
o
that
sort
should
say
what
was
to
be
done
wi
them
but
his
majesty
was
asleep
at
the
time
an
it
was
as
much
as
their
lives
was
worth
to
waken
him
so
they
had
to
wait
afore
he
awakened
out
o
that
sleep
most
o
the
men
was
dead
suffocated
for
want
o
fresh
air
i
say
mac
pass
the
water
said
moses
pyne
it
makes
a
feller
feel
quite
gaspy
to
think
of
the
proved
to
be
right
that
night
no
one
could
sleep
a
wink
except
the
big
scotsman
macleod
to
make
matters
worse
the
insects
of
the
place
were
unusually
active
one
of
them
especially
not
much
bigger
than
a
was
irritating
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
size
and
it
kept
up
during
the
night
the
warfare
which
the
innumerable
flies
had
waged
during
the
day
it
no
use
trying
to
sleep
willie
said
miles
to
armstrong
who
was
next
to
him
as
they
lay
on
the
flat
roof
of
the
redoubt
with
their
rifles
resting
on
the
sandbags
which
formed
a
slight
protection
from
the
enemy
fire
when
one
of
the
frequent
attacks
was
made
on
the
town
so
i
find
returned
his
friend
i
have
tried
everything
counting
up
to
hundreds
of
thousands
has
made
me
rather
more
wakeful
i
find
that
thinking
of
emmy
does
me
most
good
but
even
that
wo
produce
sleep
strange
remarked
miles
i
have
been
trying
the
same
sort
of
thing
without
success
and
i
had
an
unusually
hard
day
of
it
so
that
i
ought
to
be
ready
for
sleep
you
were
in
luck
being
on
h
i
do
think
much
of
my
luck
but
let
hear
what
you
have
been
up
to
all
day
well
first
i
began
by
turning
out
at
said
miles
rolling
with
a
sigh
on
his
other
side
for
a
uniform
boots
ammunition
etcetera
do
after
all
form
an
easy
after
a
cup
of
coffee
i
fell
in
with
a
lot
of
our
fellows
and
was
told
off
for
worked
away
till
then
breakfast
after
that
i
had
to
clear
up
the
mess
then
got
ready
for
inspection
parade
at
after
which
i
had
to
scrub
belts
and
clean
up
generally
dinner
over
i
was
warned
to
go
on
but
for
some
reason
which
was
not
stated
to
me
that
was
changed
and
i
not
sorry
for
it
because
the
heat
has
taken
a
good
deal
out
of
me
and
i
prefer
lying
here
beside
you
willie
to
standing
sentry
blinking
at
the
desert
and
fancying
every
bush
and
stone
to
be
a
dusky
skirmisher
of
osman
digna
by
the
way
if
that
mountain
range
where
the
enemy
lies
is
twelve
or
fourteen
miles
distant
from
the
town
they
have
a
long
way
to
come
when
they
take
a
fancy
to
attack
us
which
is
pretty
often
too
they
say
he
has
got
two
hundred
thousand
men
with
him
think
that
can
be
true
a
gentle
from
his
friend
nose
told
miles
that
he
had
brought
about
what
thoughts
of
emmy
had
failed
to
accomplish
thoughts
of
marion
had
very
nearly
brought
himself
to
a
similar
condition
when
a
the
reverse
of
gentle
roused
the
whole
line
of
defence
and
immediately
after
sharp
firing
was
heard
in
the
direction
of
the
right
water
fort
which
was
manned
by
marines
with
two
krupp
guns
and
a
gardner
a
few
rounds
from
the
big
guns
drove
the
enemy
back
in
that
direction
miles
and
those
around
him
however
had
not
to
turn
out
owing
to
their
position
on
the
roof
of
the
sphinx
redoubt
they
had
only
to
roll
on
their
fronts
rest
their
rifles
on
the
sandbags
and
they
were
at
once
ready
for
action
round
the
various
forts
and
redoubts
deep
and
broad
trenches
had
been
dug
and
they
were
rendered
otherwise
as
strong
as
possible
the
right
and
left
water
forts
formed
the
first
line
of
defence
the
latter
fort
being
manned
by
egyptian
troops
was
more
frequently
favoured
with
the
attentions
of
osman
than
the
others
for
the
marines
were
splendid
men
and
the
native
chief
was
well
aware
of
that
all
the
places
around
which
offered
the
slightest
shelter
to
the
enemy
had
been
carefully
measured
as
to
distance
so
that
the
exact
range
could
be
fixed
at
a
moment
notice
then
the
and
one
of
the
forts
were
furnished
with
electric
lights
so
that
by
bringing
these
to
bear
on
the
foe
as
well
as
the
big
and
little
guns
not
to
mention
mines
and
rifles
the
attacking
host
had
always
a
warm
reception
when
they
paid
a
visit
to
the
town
and
never
stayed
long
the
defenders
required
all
these
aids
however
for
besides
a
regiment
of
egyptian
infantry
a
company
of
royal
engineers
and
about
marines
there
was
only
one
small
battalion
of
british
troops
and
a
regiment
of
egyptian
cavalry
these
last
were
extremely
useful
every
day
they
went
out
scouting
and
clearing
around
suakim
and
had
frequent
skirmishes
with
the
enemy
in
all
of
which
they
were
said
to
have
behaved
very
well
indeed
our
party
on
the
redoubt
had
not
lain
there
long
when
a
sheet
of
flame
seemed
to
flash
out
of
the
darkness
in
front
of
them
it
was
followed
by
the
rattle
of
small
arms
instantly
the
redoubt
replied
bullets
whizzed
overhead
and
our
hero
received
what
has
of
late
been
called
a
baptism
of
fire
but
he
was
so
busy
plying
his
own
weapon
that
he
scarcely
realised
the
fact
that
death
was
ever
and
anon
within
a
few
inches
of
him
until
a
bullet
ripped
the
sandbag
on
which
his
rifle
rested
and
drove
the
sand
into
his
face
he
became
a
wiser
man
from
that
hour
and
soon
acquired
the
art
of
performing
his
duty
with
the
least
possible
exposure
of
his
person
and
that
for
the
briefest
possible
space
of
time
like
a
detective
the
electric
light
sought
out
and
exposed
their
foes
then
withering
volleys
sent
them
scurrying
across
the
country
back
to
their
native
hills
sure
it
wid
wan
eye
open
we
got
to
slape
whin
the
rascals
come
down
on
us
like
that
observed
corporal
flynn
when
the
firing
had
slackened
to
a
few
dropping
shots
on
both
sides
av
they
only
stand
fornint
us
in
the
open
it
short
work
we
make
o
them
there
no
more
pluck
in
them
than
in
my
smallest
finger
it
seemed
as
if
righteous
retribution
were
being
meted
out
that
night
for
a
spent
ball
entered
the
fort
at
that
moment
and
strange
to
say
hit
the
extreme
tip
of
the
corporal
little
finger
a
howl
as
much
of
surprise
as
pain
apprised
his
comrades
of
the
fact
and
a
hearty
laugh
followed
when
the
trifling
extent
of
the
injury
was
ascertained
serves
you
right
flynn
for
boasting
said
armstrong
with
a
grim
smile
as
he
stretched
himself
out
and
rested
his
head
on
a
sandbag
moreover
you
are
unjust
for
these
black
fellows
are
as
brave
a
lot
men
as
british
troops
have
ever
had
to
face
boys
i
off
to
the
land
of
nod
chapter
thirteen
tells
of
some
of
the
trials
uncertainties
dangers
and
disasters
of
war
uncertain
moonlight
with
a
multitude
of
cloudlets
drifting
slowly
across
the
sky
so
as
to
reveal
veil
partially
obscure
or
sometimes
totally
blot
out
the
orb
of
night
may
be
a
somewhat
romantic
but
is
not
a
desirable
state
of
things
in
an
enemy
country
especially
when
that
enemy
is
prowling
among
the
bushes
but
such
was
the
state
of
things
one
very
sultry
night
when
our
hero
found
himself
standing
in
the
open
alone
and
with
thoughts
of
a
varied
and
not
wholly
agreeable
nature
for
his
companions
he
was
on
sentry
duty
it
was
intensely
dark
when
the
clouds
partially
veiled
the
moon
for
she
was
juvenile
at
the
time
in
her
first
quarter
and
when
the
veil
was
partially
removed
the
desert
for
it
was
little
better
assumed
an
indistinct
and
appearance
sombre
thoughts
naturally
filled
the
mind
of
our
young
soldier
as
he
stood
there
alert
watchful
with
weapons
ready
ears
open
to
the
slightest
sound
and
eyes
glancing
sharply
at
the
perplexing
shadows
that
chased
each
other
over
the
ground
like
wanton
soudanese
at
play
his
faculties
were
intensely
strung
at
what
may
well
be
styled
attention
and
riveted
on
that
desert
land
to
which
fate
as
he
called
his
own
conduct
had
driven
him
yet
strange
to
say
his
mysterious
spirit
found
leisure
to
fly
back
to
old
england
and
revisit
the
scenes
of
childhood
but
he
had
robbed
himself
of
pleasure
in
that
usually
pleasant
retrospect
he
could
see
only
the
mild
sorrowful
slightly
reproachful
yet
always
loving
face
of
his
mother
when
in
imagination
he
returned
home
it
was
more
than
he
could
bear
he
turned
to
pleasanter
memories
he
was
back
again
at
portsmouth
in
the
of
the
soldiers
institute
with
comrades
around
him
busy
with
newspaper
and
illustrated
magazine
while
the
sweet
sound
of
familiar
music
came
from
the
adjoining
rooms
where
a
number
of
blue
lights
or
rather
who
were
not
ashamed
to
own
and
serve
their
maker
were
engaged
with
songs
of
praise
suddenly
he
was
back
in
egypt
with
his
heart
thumping
at
his
ribs
an
object
seemed
to
move
on
the
plain
in
front
of
him
the
ready
bayonet
was
lowered
the
trigger
was
touched
only
for
a
moment
however
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
had
passed
from
behind
a
bush
that
was
all
yet
it
was
strange
how
very
like
to
a
real
object
it
seemed
to
his
vision
a
bright
moonbeam
next
moment
showed
him
that
nothing
to
cause
alarm
was
visible
mind
is
not
so
easily
controlled
as
matter
like
a
statue
he
stood
there
in
body
but
in
mind
he
had
again
deserted
his
post
yet
not
to
so
great
a
distance
as
before
he
only
went
the
length
of
alexandria
and
thought
of
marion
the
thought
produced
a
glow
not
of
physical
heat
that
was
impossible
to
one
whose
temperature
had
already
risen
to
the
utmost
attainable
height
but
a
glow
of
soul
he
became
heroic
he
remembered
marion
burning
words
and
resolved
that
duty
should
henceforth
be
his
duty
his
heart
sank
as
he
thought
of
the
word
for
the
something
within
him
became
suddenly
active
and
whispered
how
about
your
duty
to
parents
you
left
them
in
a
rage
you
spent
some
time
in
portsmouth
surrounded
by
good
influences
and
might
have
written
home
but
you
did
you
made
some
feeble
attempts
indeed
but
failed
you
might
have
done
it
several
times
since
you
landed
in
this
country
but
you
have
you
know
quite
well
that
you
have
not
fully
repented
even
yet
while
the
whispering
was
going
on
the
active
fancy
of
the
youth
saw
the
lovely
face
of
marion
looking
at
him
with
mournful
interest
as
it
had
been
the
face
of
an
angel
and
then
there
came
to
his
memory
words
which
had
been
spoken
to
him
that
very
day
by
his
earnest
friend
stevenson
the
marine
no
man
can
fully
do
his
duty
to
his
fellows
until
he
has
begun
to
do
his
duty
to
god
the
words
had
not
been
used
in
reference
to
himself
but
in
connection
with
a
discussion
as
to
the
motives
generally
which
influence
men
but
the
words
were
made
use
of
by
the
spirit
as
arrows
to
pierce
the
heart
guilty
he
exclaimed
aloud
and
almost
involuntary
followed
god
forgive
me
again
the
watchful
ear
distinguished
unwonted
sounds
and
the
sharp
eye
wonderfully
sharpened
by
frequent
danger
perceived
objects
in
motion
on
the
plain
this
time
the
objects
were
real
they
approached
it
was
the
rounds
who
visited
the
sentries
six
times
during
each
night
in
another
part
of
the
ground
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
spot
where
our
hero
mounted
guard
stood
a
youthful
soldier
also
on
guard
and
thinking
no
doubt
of
home
he
was
much
too
young
for
service
in
such
a
climate
almost
a
boy
he
was
a
ruddy
healthy
lad
with
plenty
of
courage
and
high
spirit
who
was
willing
to
encounter
anything
cheerfully
so
long
as
in
so
doing
he
could
serve
his
queen
and
country
but
he
was
careless
of
his
own
comfort
and
safety
several
times
he
had
been
found
fault
with
for
going
out
in
the
sun
without
his
white
helmet
miles
had
taken
a
fancy
to
the
lad
and
had
spoken
seriously
but
very
kindly
to
him
that
very
day
about
the
folly
of
exposing
himself
in
a
way
that
had
already
cost
so
many
men
their
lives
but
young
lewis
laughed
and
said
that
he
was
too
tough
to
be
killed
by
the
sun
the
suffocating
heat
of
that
night
told
upon
him
however
severely
tough
though
he
was
or
supposed
himself
to
be
while
he
kept
his
lonely
watch
on
the
sandy
plain
presently
a
dark
figure
was
seen
approaching
the
sentinel
at
once
challenged
and
brought
his
rifle
to
the
ready
the
man
who
was
a
native
gave
the
password
all
right
and
made
some
apparently
commonplace
remark
as
he
passed
which
coupled
with
his
easy
manner
and
the
correct
countersign
threw
the
young
soldier
off
his
guard
suddenly
a
long
sharp
knife
gleamed
in
the
faint
light
and
was
drawn
across
the
body
of
lewis
before
he
could
raise
a
hand
to
defend
himself
he
fell
instantly
mortally
wounded
with
his
entrails
cut
open
at
the
same
moment
the
tramp
of
the
rounds
was
heard
and
the
native
glided
back
into
the
darkness
from
which
he
had
so
recently
emerged
when
the
soldiers
came
to
the
post
they
found
the
poor
young
soldier
dying
he
was
able
to
tell
what
had
occurred
while
they
were
making
preparations
to
carry
him
away
but
when
they
reached
the
fort
they
found
that
his
brief
career
had
ended
a
damp
was
cast
on
the
spirits
of
the
men
of
his
company
when
they
learned
next
day
what
had
occurred
for
the
lad
had
been
a
great
favourite
but
soldiers
in
time
of
war
are
too
much
accustomed
to
look
upon
death
in
every
form
to
be
deeply
or
for
long
affected
by
incidents
of
the
kind
only
the
comrades
who
had
become
unusually
attached
to
this
poor
youth
mourned
his
death
as
if
he
had
been
a
brother
in
the
flesh
as
well
as
in
the
ranks
he
was
a
good
lad
said
sergeant
gilroy
as
they
kept
watch
on
the
roof
of
the
fort
that
night
since
we
came
here
he
has
never
missed
writing
to
his
mother
a
single
mail
it
is
true
being
an
amiable
lad
and
easily
led
through
his
affections
he
had
given
way
to
drink
to
some
extent
but
no
later
than
yesterday
i
prevailed
upon
him
to
join
our
temperance
band
what
become
a
blue
light
exclaimed
sutherland
with
something
of
a
sneer
in
his
tone
ah
comrade
and
i
hope
to
live
to
see
you
join
our
band
also
and
become
one
of
the
bluest
lights
among
us
returned
the
sergeant
never
replied
sutherland
with
emphasis
you
never
live
to
see
that
perhaps
not
but
if
i
do
live
to
see
it
some
one
else
will
rejoined
the
sergeant
laying
his
hand
gently
on
the
man
shoulder
is
that
you
again
it
wishin
i
am
that
i
had
you
in
ould
ireland
growled
corporal
flynn
referring
to
osman
digna
whose
men
had
opened
fire
on
the
neighbouring
fort
and
again
roused
the
whole
garrison
slape
is
out
o
the
question
wi
such
a
muskitos
buzzin
about
bad
luck
to
what
good
would
it
do
to
send
him
to
ireland
asked
simkin
as
he
yawned
rolled
over
and
like
the
rest
of
his
comrades
loaded
his
rifle
why
man
do
ye
see
av
he
was
in
ould
ireland
he
could
be
disturbin
our
night
rest
here
moreover
they
make
a
dacent
man
of
there
in
no
time
it
always
the
way
if
an
english
blackguard
goes
over
to
ireland
he
almost
sure
to
return
home
more
or
less
of
a
gintleman
that
why
i
always
advised
you
to
go
over
boy
maybe
if
osman
wint
he
hallo
a
flash
of
light
and
whistling
of
bullets
overhead
effectually
stopped
the
irishman
discourse
not
that
he
was
at
all
alarmed
by
the
familiar
incident
but
being
a
change
of
subject
it
became
more
absorbingly
interesting
than
the
conversation
besides
necessitating
some
active
precautions
the
firing
seemed
to
indicate
an
attack
in
several
places
along
the
line
of
defence
at
one
of
the
posts
called
the
new
house
the
attack
was
very
sharp
the
enemy
could
not
have
been
much
if
at
all
over
three
hundred
yards
distant
in
the
shelter
of
three
large
pits
of
course
the
fire
was
vigorously
returned
a
colonel
and
major
were
there
on
the
redoubt
with
powerful
and
directed
the
men
where
to
fire
until
the
general
himself
appeared
on
the
scene
and
took
command
on
the
left
from
quarantine
island
the
royal
engineers
kept
up
a
heavy
and
on
the
right
they
were
helped
by
a
fort
which
was
manned
by
egyptian
troops
from
these
three
points
a
heavy
fire
was
kept
up
and
continued
till
six
in
the
morning
by
that
time
the
enemy
having
been
finally
driven
out
of
the
pits
a
party
was
sent
across
to
see
what
execution
had
been
done
it
was
wonderfully
little
considering
the
amount
of
ammunition
and
energy
expended
in
the
first
pit
one
man
was
found
dead
a
bullet
had
entered
his
forehead
and
come
out
at
the
back
of
his
head
moving
him
a
little
on
one
side
they
found
another
man
under
him
shot
in
the
same
way
all
round
the
pit
inside
were
large
pools
of
blood
but
no
bodies
for
the
natives
invariably
dragged
or
carried
away
their
dead
when
that
was
possible
in
the
other
two
pits
large
pools
of
blood
were
also
found
but
no
bodies
beyond
them
however
one
man
was
discovered
shot
through
the
heart
he
had
evidently
been
dragged
along
the
sand
but
the
tremendous
fire
of
the
defenders
had
compelled
the
enemy
to
drop
him
still
further
on
they
found
twelve
more
corpses
which
had
been
dragged
a
short
way
and
then
left
close
to
these
they
observed
that
the
sand
had
been
disturbed
and
on
turning
it
up
found
that
a
dozen
of
bodies
had
been
hastily
buried
there
altogether
they
calculated
that
at
least
fifty
of
the
enemy
had
been
killed
on
that
occasion
a
calculation
which
was
curiously
verified
by
the
friendly
tribes
asking
permission
to
bury
the
dead
according
to
the
soudanese
custom
this
was
granted
of
course
and
thus
the
exact
number
killed
was
ascertained
but
how
many
had
been
wounded
no
one
could
tell
fifty
desolated
homes
remarked
one
of
the
men
when
the
number
of
killed
was
announced
at
mess
that
day
he
was
a
cynical
man
who
had
just
come
out
of
hospital
after
a
pretty
severe
illness
fifty
widows
he
continued
to
say
nothin
o
that
are
just
as
fond
o
husbands
an
fathers
as
are
why
jack
hall
if
these
are
your
sentiments
you
should
never
have
enlisted
cried
simkin
with
a
laugh
i
when
i
was
drunk
returned
hall
savagely
och
then
it
sarves
ye
right
said
flynn
even
a
pig
would
be
ashamed
to
do
anythin
whin
it
was
in
liquor
the
corporal
remark
prevented
the
conversation
taking
a
lugubrious
turn
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
few
of
the
men
who
could
not
endure
to
look
at
anything
from
a
serious
point
of
view
what
the
use
one
of
them
asked
of
pullin
a
long
face
over
what
you
ca
change
here
we
are
boys
to
kill
or
be
killed
my
creed
is
things
as
they
come
and
be
jolly
it
wo
mend
matters
to
think
about
wives
and
wo
it
cried
armstrong
looking
up
with
a
bright
expression
from
a
sheet
of
paper
on
which
he
had
just
been
writing
here
am
i
home
to
wife
in
a
hurry
too
for
i
only
just
heard
that
word
has
been
passed
the
mail
for
england

i
warned
for
guard
too
an
if
the
night
takes
after
the
day
we
in
for
a
chance
o
suffocation
to
say
nothing
o
insects
as
you
all
know
now
wo
it
mend
matters
that
i
got
a
dear
girl
over
the
sea
to
think
about
and
to
say
bless
her
body
and
soul
no
doubt
retorted
the
man
but
but
but
cried
hall
coming
promptly
to
his
rescue
have
not
the
soudanese
got
wives
an
children
as
well
as
us
i
daresay
they
have
some
of
well
does
the
thought
of
your
respective
wives
an
children
prevent
your
shooting
or
sticking
each
other
when
you
get
the
chance
of
course
it
do
returned
armstrong
with
a
laugh
as
he
resumed
his
pencil
what
would
be
the
use
o
comin
here
if
we
did
do
that
but
i
have
time
to
argue
with
you
just
now
hall
all
i
know
is
that
it
my
duty
to
write
to
my
wife
an
i
wo
let
the
chance
slip
when
i
got
it
bah
exclaimed
the
cynic
relighting
his
pipe
which
in
the
heat
of
debate
he
had
allowed
to
go
out
several
of
the
other
men
having
been
reminded
of
the
mail
by
the
conversation
also
betook
themselves
to
pen
and
pencil
though
their
hands
were
more
familiar
with
rifle
and
bayonet
among
these
was
miles
milton
mindful
of
his
recent
thoughts
and
with
the
word
which
his
friend
had
just
emphasised
he
sat
down
and
wrote
a
distinctly
letter
home
there
was
not
a
word
of
excuse
explanation
or
palliation
in
it
from
beginning
to
end
in
short
it
expressed
one
idea
throughout
and
that
was
guilty
and
of
course
this
was
followed
by
his
asking
forgiveness
he
had
forgiveness
though
he
knew
it
not
long
before
he
asked
it
his
father
and
his
mother
had
forgiven
him
in
their
hearts
long
before
even
before
they
received
that
treasured
fragment
from
portsmouth
which
began
and
ended
with
dearest
mother
i
am
sorry
after
finishing
and
despatching
the
letter
miles
went
out
with
a
feeling
of
lightness
about
his
heart
that
he
had
not
felt
since
that
wretched
day
when
he
forsook
his
father
house
as
it
was
still
early
in
the
afternoon
he
resolved
to
take
a
ramble
in
the
town
but
seeing
sergeant
gilroy
and
another
man
busy
with
the
gardner
gun
on
the
roof
of
the
redoubt
he
turned
aside
to
ask
the
sergeant
to
accompany
him
for
gilroy
was
a
very
genial
christian
and
miles
had
lately
begun
to
relish
his
earnest
intelligent
talk
dashed
as
it
was
with
many
a
touch
of
humour
the
gun
they
were
working
with
at
the
time
had
been
used
the
day
before
in
ascertaining
the
exact
range
of
several
objects
on
the
ground
in
front
i
be
happy
to
go
with
you
miles
after
i
given
this
gun
a
said
gilroy
turn
the
handle
sutherland
i
turn
the
handle
if
it
a
richt
said
the
cautious
scot
with
some
hesitation
it
is
all
right
returned
the
sergeant
we
ran
the
feeder
out
last
night
you
know
and
i
want
to
have
the
barrels
cleaned
turn
away
thus
ordered
a
second
time
sutherland
obeyed
and
turned
the
handle
the
gun
went
off
and
its
contents
passed
through
the
sergeant
groin
making
a
hole
through
which
a
man
could
have
passed
his
arm
he
dropped
at
once
and
while
some
ran
for
the
doctor
and
some
for
water
others
brought
a
stretcher
to
carry
the
poor
fellow
to
hospital
meanwhile
miles
going
down
on
his
knees
beside
him
raised
his
head
and
moistened
his
pale
lips
with
water
he
could
hardly
speak
but
a
smile
passed
over
his
face
as
he
said
faintly
she
get
my
presents
by
this
mail
write
miles
break
it
to
her
we
meet
again
by
the
side
of
jesus
god
be
praised
he
ceased
and
never
spoke
again
gilroy
was
a
married
man
with
five
children
just
before
the
accident
he
had
written
to
his
wife
enclosing
gifts
for
his
little
ones
and
telling
in
a
thankful
spirit
of
continued
health
and
safety
before
the
with
his
letter
on
board
was
out
of
sight
he
was
dead
chapter
fourteen
describes
some
of
osman
digna
eccentricities
and
other
matters
one
day
miles
and
his
friend
armstrong
went
to
have
a
ramble
in
the
town
of
suakim
and
were
proceeding
through
the
bazaar
when
they
encountered
simkin
hurrying
towards
them
with
a
much
too
serious
expression
on
his
face
have
you
heard
the
he
asked
on
coming
up
no
what
up
the
old
bin
killed
all
the
the
egyptian
bin
sent
out
after
them
nonsense
you
dreaming
or
you
bin
drinking
said
miles
neither
dreamin
nor
drinkin
returned
simkin
with
indignation
as
he
suddenly
delivered
a
blow
at
our
hero
face
miles
stopped
it
however
gave
him
a
playful
punch
in
the
chest
and
passed
on
at
first
simkin
seemed
inclined
to
resent
this
but
while
he
swayed
about
in
frowning
indecision
his
comrades
left
him
shaking
his
head
therefore
with
intense
gravity
he
walked
away
muttering
not
a
bad
fellow
miles
after
all
if
he
so
fond
o
the
miles
was
at
the
same
moment
making
the
same
remark
to
his
friend
in
reference
to
simkin
and
with
greater
truth
but
i
do
wonder
that
the
men
who
drink
go
in
for
it
harder
than
ever
here
continued
miles
there
is
such
hard
work
and
constant
exposure
and
so
little
recreation
of
any
sort
yet
it
is
a
pity
that
men
should
give
way
to
it
for
too
many
of
our
comrades
are
on
the
because
of
it
and
some
under
the
sod
it
is
far
more
than
a
pity
returned
armstrong
with
unwonted
energy
drink
with
its
attendant
evils
is
one
of
the
great
curses
of
the
army
i
have
been
told
and
i
can
well
believe
it
that
drink
causes
more
loss
to
an
army
than
war
the
dangers
of
foreign
service
and
unhealthy
climates
all
put
together
that
a
strong
statement
willie
and
would
need
to
be
founded
on
good
authority
who
told
you
our
new
parson
told
me
and
he
is
in
my
opinion
a
good
authority
because
he
is
a
christian
if
ever
a
man
was
and
he
is
an
elderly
man
besides
being
uncommonly
clever
and
well
informed
he
told
us
a
great
many
strong
facts
at
the
temperance
meeting
we
held
last
night
i
wish
you
had
been
there
miles
it
would
have
warmed
your
heart
i
think
have
you
joined
them
willie
yes
i
have
and
god
helping
me
i
mean
to
stick
by
them
i
would
have
gone
to
the
meeting
myself
said
miles
thoughtfully
if
i
had
been
asked
strange
returned
armstrong
that
sergeant
hardy
said
to
me
he
thought
of
asking
you
to
accompany
us
but
had
an
idea
that
you
care
to
go
now
just
look
at
that
lot
there
beside
the
door
what
a
commentary
on
the
evils
of
drink
the
lot
to
which
he
referred
consisted
of
a
group
of
miserable
loungers
in
filthy
garments
and
who
in
excitement
or
solemn
stupidity
stood
squabbling
in
front
of
one
of
the
many
greek
with
which
the
town
was
cursed
passing
by
at
the
moment
with
the
stately
contempt
engendered
by
a
splendid
physique
and
a
red
coat
strode
a
trooper
one
of
the
defenders
of
the
town
his
gait
was
steady
enough
but
there
was
that
unmistakable
something
in
the
expression
of
his
face
which
told
that
he
was
in
the
grip
of
the
same
fiend
that
had
captured
the
men
round
the
door
he
was
to
both
armstrong
and
miles
hallo
johnson
cried
the
latter
is
there
any
truth
in
the
he
stopped
and
looked
steadily
in
the
trooper
eyes
without
speaking
oh
yes
i
know
what
you
mean
said
johnson
with
a
reckless
air
i
know
that
i
drunk
i
would
say
exactly
that
of
you
returned
miles
but
well
well
i
say
it
of
myself
continued
the
trooper
it
no
use
humbuggin
about
it
i
swimmin
wi
the
current
goin
to
the
dogs
like
a
runaway
locomotive
of
course
i
see
well
enough
that
men
like
sergeant
hardy
an
stevenson
of
the
marines
who
have
been
temperance
men
all
their
lives
enjoy
good
health
would
to
god
i
was
like
and
i
know
that
drinkers
are
dyin
off
like
sheep
but
that
makes
it
all
the
worse
for
me
for
to
tell
you
the
honest
truth
boys
an
i
care
who
knows
it
i
leave
off
drinkin
it
killin
me
by
inches
i
know
likewise
that
all
the
old
hard
drinkers
here
are
soon
sent
home
ruined
for
life
such
of
at
least
as
do
leave
their
miserable
bones
in
the
sand
and
i
know
that
i
on
the
road
to
destruction
but
i
ca
i
give
it
up
ha
johnson
said
armstrong
these
are
the
very
words
quoted
by
the
new
parson
at
the
temperance
meetin
last
night
an
he
a
splendid
fellow
with
his
tongue
drinker
says
he
are
yourself
you
say
you
give
up
the
drink
the
real
truth
is
my
man
that
you
give
it
up
if
only
i
could
persuade
you
in
god
strength
to
say
i
you
soon
come
all
right
now
johnson
if
you
come
with
me
to
the
next
meetin
what
go
to
a
temperance
meetin
cried
the
trooper
with
something
of
scorn
in
his
laugh
you
might
as
well
ask
the
devil
to
go
to
church
no
no
armstrong
i
past
prayin
for
thank
you
all
the
same
for
invitin
me
but
what
was
you
askin
about
news
bein
true
what
news
why
that
the
old
shepherd
has
been
killed
and
all
our
cattle
are
captured
and
the
egyptian
cavalry
sent
after
them
you
do
say
so
cried
the
trooper
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
suddenly
shakes
off
a
heavy
burden
if
that
so
they
be
us
also
no
doubt
without
another
word
he
turned
and
strode
away
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
could
carry
him
although
there
might
possibly
be
a
call
for
infantry
to
follow
miles
and
his
friend
did
not
see
that
it
was
needful
to
make
for
their
fort
at
more
than
their
ordinary
pace
it
was
a
curious
and
crowded
scene
they
had
to
traverse
besides
the
already
mentioned
there
were
numerous
where
from
diminutive
cups
natives
of
temperate
habits
slaked
their
thirst
and
discussed
the
news
of
which
by
the
way
there
was
no
lack
at
the
time
for
besides
the
activity
of
osman
digna
and
his
hordes
there
were
frequent
arrivals
of
mails
and
sometimes
of
reinforcements
from
lower
egypt
in
the
were
many
smithies
where
and
knives
were
being
forged
by
men
who
had
not
the
most
distant
belief
that
such
weapons
would
ever
be
turned
into
there
were
also
workers
in
leather
who
sewed
up
passages
of
the
koran
in
leathern
cases
and
sold
them
as
amulets
to
be
worn
on
necks
and
arms
elsewhere
hairdressers
were
busy
greasing
and
powdering
with
the
dust
of
the
bushy
locks
of
hadendoa
dandies
in
short
all
the
activities
of
eastern
city
life
were
being
carried
on
as
energetically
as
if
the
place
were
in
perfect
security
though
the
only
bulwark
that
preserved
it
hour
by
hour
from
being
swept
by
the
innumerable
hordes
of
soudan
savagery
consisted
of
a
few
hundreds
of
british
and
egyptian
soldiers
arrived
at
the
sphinx
fort
the
friends
found
that
the
news
was
only
too
true
the
stolen
cattle
belonged
to
the
people
of
suakim
every
morning
at
six
it
was
the
custom
of
the
shepherds
to
go
out
with
their
herds
and
flocks
to
graze
there
being
no
forage
in
or
near
the
town
all
had
to
be
back
by
sunset
when
the
gates
were
locked
and
no
one
was
allowed
out
or
in
till
six
the
next
morning
the
women
who
carried
all
the
water
used
in
the
waterless
town
had
of
course
to
conform
to
the
same
rule
like
most
men
who
are
constantly
exposed
to
danger
the
shepherds
became
careless
or
foolhardy
and
wandered
rather
far
with
their
herds
osman
was
too
astute
to
neglect
his
opportunities
on
this
occasion
an
old
shepherd
who
was
at
sphinx
redoubt
had
strayed
too
far
the
soudanese
swept
down
cut
off
his
retreat
killed
him
and
as
we
have
said
carried
off
his
cattle
it
was
to
retrieve
if
possible
or
avenge
this
disaster
that
the
egyptian
cavalry
sallied
forth
they
were
seen
galloping
after
the
foe
when
miles
reached
the
roof
of
the
redoubt
where
some
of
his
comrades
were
on
duty
while
captain
lacey
and
several
officers
were
looking
on
with
they
are
too
late
i
fear
to
do
much
good
remarked
one
of
the
officers
do
i
wish
i
was
goin
wid
them
whispered
corporal
flynn
to
a
comrade
ye
wad
be
a
queer
objec
on
the
ootside
o
a
horse
remarked
macleod
cynically
why
mac
ye
would
have
me
go
of
a
horse
would
ye
it
wad
be
much
the
same
which
way
ye
went
returned
the
scot
ah
thin
the
horse
would
think
so
unless
he
was
a
donkey
well
done
exclaimed
captain
lacey
at
that
moment
as
the
cavalry
cut
off
and
succeeded
in
recapturing
a
few
of
the
cattle
and
gave
the
enemy
several
volleys
which
caused
them
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
this
however
turned
out
to
be
a
on
the
part
of
osman
who
had
his
men
concealed
in
strong
force
there
he
tried
to
draw
the
cavalry
away
from
suakim
and
was
very
nearly
successful
in
the
ardour
of
pursuit
the
egyptians
failed
to
observe
that
the
soudanese
were
creeping
round
their
rear
to
cut
off
retreat
on
discovering
their
mistake
and
finding
that
their
small
force
of
two
hundred
men
was
being
surrounded
by
thousands
of
arab
warriors
it
was
almost
too
late
turning
at
once
they
galloped
back
and
could
be
seen
through
the
turning
now
and
then
gallantly
to
engage
the
pursuing
foe
no
help
could
be
rendered
them
at
first
as
they
were
beyond
the
range
of
all
the
forts
nevertheless
they
got
in
safely
with
little
injury
to
man
or
beast
and
driving
before
them
the
animals
that
had
been
recovered
next
day
the
body
of
the
poor
old
shepherd
was
brought
in
and
buried
without
a
coffin
by
his
relations
miles
being
off
duty
at
the
time
went
to
see
the
funeral
and
found
that
eastern
and
western
ideas
on
this
point
as
on
many
others
are
wide
as
the
poles
asunder
no
doubt
the
grief
of
the
near
relations
was
as
real
as
it
was
demonstrative
but
it
required
more
credulity
than
he
possessed
to
enable
him
to
believe
that
the
howling
shouting
and
singing
of
many
mourners
was
indicative
of
genuine
feeling
the
creation
of
noise
indeed
seemed
to
be
their
chief
method
of
paying
respect
to
the
dead
as
deaths
in
suakim
were
very
numerous
at
this
time
owing
to
much
sickness
among
natives
as
well
as
troops
the
sounds
of
mourning
whether
by
volley
or
voice
became
so
frequent
that
orders
were
at
last
given
to
cease
firing
over
the
soldiers
graves
when
they
were
buried
just
ahead
of
the
shepherd
body
came
some
poor
women
who
were
weeping
falling
down
at
intervals
and
kissing
the
ground
on
reaching
the
wall
round
the
land
side
of
the
town
these
women
stopped
formed
a
circle
and
kneeled
on
the
sand
while
the
body
was
passing
them
then
they
leaned
forward
and
kissed
the
ground
continuing
in
that
position
till
all
the
procession
had
passed
there
the
women
remained
not
being
allowed
to
go
to
the
grave
and
the
singing
and
shouting
were
continued
by
boys
who
kept
running
round
the
bier
as
it
was
borne
along
on
reaching
the
grave
the
body
was
put
in
with
the
face
toward
the
east
and
covered
up
with
stones
and
mortar
then
the
grave
was
filled
up
with
sand
a
brief
prayer
was
offered
the
mourners
kneeling
after
which
the
people
went
home
sad
thoughts
filled
the
mind
of
our
young
soldier
as
he
returned
to
the
fort
but
the
sadness
was
soon
turned
to
indignation
when
he
got
there
for
some
time
past
a
soudanese
youth
of
about
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
of
age
had
been
coming
about
the
sphinx
redoubt
and
ingratiating
himself
with
the
men
who
took
a
great
fancy
to
him
because
he
was
amiable
in
disposition
somewhat
humorous
as
well
as
lively
and
handsome
though
black
they
used
to
give
him
something
to
eat
every
time
he
came
and
made
quite
a
pet
of
him
one
day
while
he
was
out
in
the
open
country
osman
men
captured
this
youth
and
took
him
at
once
before
their
leader
who
probably
regarding
him
as
a
deserter
ordered
both
his
hands
to
be
cut
off
close
to
the
wrists
the
cruel
deed
was
done
and
the
poor
lad
was
sent
back
to
suakim
it
was
this
that
roused
the
wrath
of
miles
as
well
as
that
of
his
comrades
when
they
saw
the
raw
stumps
and
the
haggard
look
of
the
poor
fellow
who
had
suffered
much
from
loss
of
blood
they
got
into
a
state
of
mind
that
would
have
made

no

the
baste
the
others
were
equally
angry
though
not
quite
so
emphatic
but
they
did
not
waste
their
time
in
useless
regrets
they
hurried
the
young
soudanese
to
the
doctor
who
carefully
dressed
his
wounds
and
every
care
was
thereafter
taken
of
him
by
the
men
until
completely
restored
to
health
it
may
interest
the
reader
to
know
that
this
poor
fellow
was
afterwards
well
looked
after
some
sort
of
employment
in
the
garrison
was
obtained
for
him
and
he
was
found
to
be
a
useful
and
willing
servant
despite
the
absence
of
his
hands
that
night
a
furious
burst
upon
the
town
accompanied
by
oppressive
heat
it
always
seems
to
me
said
miles
to
gaspard
redgrave
who
lay
next
him
that
mosquitoes
and
cats
and
dogs
and
in
fact
the
whole
brute
creation
becomes
more
lively
when
the
weather
is
unusually
hot
just
listen
to
these
cats
like
a
colony
of
small
children
being
murdered
said
gaspard
it
awfu
observed
saunders
in
a
kind
of
solemn
astonishment
as
a
frightful
caterwaul
burst
upon
their
ears
i
wadna
like
to
hear
teegers
in
the
same
state
o
mind
or
elephants
murmured
moses
pyne
who
was
more
than
half
asleep
the
cats
were
indeed
a
great
nuisance
for
not
satisfied
with
getting
on
the
flat
roofs
of
the
houses
at
nights
and
keeping
up
a
species
of
there
they
invaded
the
soldiers
quarters
upsetting
things
in
the
dark
thus
demonstrating
the
absurdity
of
the
proverb
that
cats
see
best
in
the
dark
stealing
whatever
they
could
lay
hold
of
and
inducing
men
to
fling
boots
and
shoes
or
whatever
came
most
handy
at
them
rats
also
were
innumerable
and
to
the
great
surprise
not
to
say
indignation
of
the
men
neither
dogs
nor
cats
paid
the
least
attention
to
the
rats
after
a
time
the
storm
both
of
animate
and
inanimate
nature
began
to
abate
and
the
weary
overworked
soldiers
were
dropping
off
to
sleep
when
a
tremendous
explosion
effectually
roused
them
there
goes
another
mine
cried
armstrong
starting
up
it
do
require
a
prophet
to
tell
us
that
growled
gaspard
as
he
yawned
and
slowly
picked
up
his
rifle
explosions
were
of
quite
common
occurrence
at
that
time
but
had
to
be
attended
to
nevertheless
that
osman
had
taken
advantage
of
the
very
dark
night
to
make
an
earlier
attack
than
usual
was
evident
for
shots
were
fired
immediately
after
the
explosion
occurred
as
usual
these
were
replied
to
but
the
effect
of
the
explosion
it
was
supposed
must
have
been
unusually
severe
for
the
enemy
withdrew
after
exchanging
only
a
few
shots
this
surmise
was
afterwards
proved
to
be
correct
on
going
to
the
spot
the
following
morning
they
found
that
at
least
a
dozen
of
their
foes
must
have
been
blown
up
for
legs
and
arms
and
other
human
remains
were
picked
up
in
all
directions
these
the
soldiers
gathered
with
the
aid
of
the
friendly
natives
and
burned
no
attack
was
made
for
four
days
after
that
but
then
the
untiring
enemy
became
as
troublesome
as
ever
spies
afterwards
said
that
when
osman
heard
of
this
incident
and
of
the
number
of
men
killed
he
said
it
served
them
right
they
had
no
business
to
go
touching
things
that
did
not
belong
to
them
chapter

a
new
acquaintance

up
an
expedition

by

energetic
and

sometimes
the
effect
of

fail
to

with

in

to

or

after
the
troops
had
been
some
time
at
suakim
the
effect
of
the
climate
began
to
tell
on
them
so
severely
that
a
very
large
proportion
of
europeans
were
in
hospital
and
many
who
strove
hard
to
brave
it
out
were
scarcely
fit
for
duty
great
heat
did
not
however
interfere
with
miles
milton
health
he
was
one
of
those
fortunates
who
seem
to
have
been
made
of
tougher
clay
than
the
average
of
humanity
but
his
friend
armstrong
was
laid
up
for
a
considerable
time
even
robert
macleod
was
knocked
over
for
a
brief
period
and
the
lively
corporal
flynn
succumbed
at
last

however
stood
the
test
of
hard
work
and
bad
climate
well
and
so
for
a
time
did
sergeant
hardy
it
was
found
generally
that
the
abstainers
from
strong
drink
suffered
less
from
bad
health
and
unwholesome
surroundings
than
their
fellows
and
as
there
were
a
good
many
in
the
regiment
who
were
constantly
endeavouring
to
convince
their
comrades
of
the
advantages
of
things
were
not
so
bad
as
they
might
have
been
it
was
about
this
time
that
one
of
the
generals
who
visited
suakim
instituted
athletic
games
thereby
vastly
improving
the
health
and
spirits
of
the
men
and
now
miles
milton
learned
for
the
first
time
what
an
immense
power
there
lies
in
scientific
training
one
evening
when
out
walking
with
stevenson
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
race
with
him
and
having
been
a
crack
runner
at
school
he
beat
him
easily
why
miles
said
his
friend
when
the
short
race
was
over
i
had
no
idea
you
could
run
so
well
if
you
choose
i
will
put
you
in
training
for
the
coming
sports
you
must
know
that
i
have
run
and
walked
and
competed
in
the
track
many
a
time
at
home
and
have
trained
and
brought
out
runners
who
had
no
notion
of
what
was
in
them
till
i
proved
it
to
them
by
training
will
you
go
in
for
it
and
promise
to
do
as
i
bid
you
i
have
no
objection
replied
miles
with
a
light
laugh
if
he
had
known
what
his
friend
intended
to
do
he
might
not
have
agreed
so
readily
for
from
that
hour
till
the
day
of
the
sports
stevenson
made
him
go
through
an
amount
of
running
even
after
being
made
stiff
by
previous
runs
that
he
would
never
have
agreed
to
undertake
unless
forced
to
do
so
we
say
because
our
hero
regarded
a
promise
once
given
as
sacred
his
was
a
curiously
compound
nature
so
that
while
in
some
points
of
conduct
he
was
lax
as
we
have
seen
in
others
he
was
very
strict
he
was
peculiarly
so
in
regard
to
promises
his
comrades
soon
came
to
know
this
and
ultimately
came
to
consider
him
a
very
reliable
man
having
then
promised
his
friend
to
keep
sternly
to
his
work
he
did
so
with
the
result
that
his
strength
increased
wonderfully
another
result
was
that
he
carried
off
the
first
prize
in
all
the
races
in
order
to
make
the
most
of
time
and
avoid
the
evils
of
noonday
heat
it
was
arranged
that
the
races
etcetera
for
the
egyptian
soldiers
and
natives
in
government
employ
should
come
off
in
the
morning
and
that
the
british
troops
should
run
in
the
later
and
cooler
parts
of
the
day
with
the
temperature
at
degrees
in
the
shade
it
would
have
been
dangerous
for
europeans
to
compete
the
sports
including
our
familiar
cricket
were
greatly
enjoyed
and
the
result
was
a
decided
improvement
in
the
health
of
the
whole
force
were
also
included
in
these
sports
at
the
conclusion
of
one
of
these
miles
to
his
great
surprise
encountered
his
old
acquaintance
of
the
big
jack
molloy
why
jack
exclaimed
miles
as
the
hearty
tar
wrung
his
hand
have
expected
to
see
here
ah
who
indeed
an
i
may
say
ditto
i
glad
to
see
you
molloy
for
to
say
truth
i
thought
i
had
seen
the
last
of
you
when
we
parted
in
the
i
often
thought
of
you
since
and
of
our
first
evening
together
in
the
the
what
was
its
name
the
man
alive
i
wonder
you
forgot
it
blessin
on
it
ai
likely
to
forget
it
why
it
was
there
did
i
ever
tell
you
the
wery
night
arter
i
met
you
that
a
messmate
took
me
to
the
big
hall
back
o
the
it
no
use
me
tryin
fur
to
tell
you
all
i
heard
in
that
there
big
hall
but
when
i
come
out
blow
if
i
did
sign
the
pledge
right
away
an
i
took
a
drop
o
grog
since
glad
to
hear
it
jack
for
to
say
truth
i
never
saw
the
evil
of
grog
so
clearly
as
i
have
since
coming
out
here
and
seeing
strong
stout
men
cast
down
by
it
in
dozens
many
of
them
men
whom
i
would
have
thought
safe
from
such
a
thing
indeed
i
have
more
than
half
a
mind
to
join
the
good
templars
myself
young
man
said
molloy
sternly
if
it
takes
the
death
of
dozens
stout
men
to
force
you
to
make
up
half
your
mind
how
many
want
to
die
before
you
make
up
the
whole
of
it
but
i
said
that
my
mind
was
than
half
made
up
returned
miles
with
a
smile
now
lookee
here
rejoined
the
sailor
earnestly
it
all
wery
well
for
milksops
an
nincompoops
and
landlubbers
to
go
in
for
work
like
that
but
you
not
the
man
i
takes
you
for
if
you
ai
game
for
more
than
that
so
i
ax
you
to
promise
me
that
you
sign
the
pledge
right
off
as
i
did
first
time
you
gits
the
chance
but
you
forget
i
only
a
landlubber
who
according
to
you
is
fit
for
only
measures
said
miles
who
not
being
addicted
to
much
wine
felt
disinclined
to
bind
himself
no
matter
returned
the
sailor
with
deepening
earnestness
if
you
go
in
fur
it
you
repent
it
take
my
word
for
that
now
i
ax
ye
to
promise
well
i
promise
the
very
first
time
i
get
the
chance
and
that
will
be
night
for
our
new
parson
has
started
temperance
meetings
and
he
is
a
great
teetotaller
an
you
promise
to
stick
to
it
added
molloy
when
i
give
a
promise
i
stick
to
it
returned
miles
gravely
right
you
are
lad
give
us
your
flipper
the
foregoing
conversation
took
place
at
the
harbour
a
little
apart
from
the
noisy
group
of
soldiers
and
sailors
who
were
discussing
the
circumstances
of
the
recent
immediately
after
it
molloy
returned
to
his
ship
in
the
harbour
and
our
hero
to
his
post
in
the
line
of
defence
one
of
those
who
had
been
conspicuous
that
day
in
arranging
and
starting
the
races
acting
as
umpire
at
the
cricket
and
generally
putting
heart
and
spirit
into
everything
by
his
quiet
and
activity
was
the
young
officer
of
engineers
who
has
been
already
mentioned
as
the
manager
of
the
mines
that
were
laid
around
suakim
poor
fellow
little
did
he
imagine
that
that
was
to
be
his
last
day
on
earth
every
morning
as
before
mentioned
this
young
officer
went
out
alone
to
perform
the
dangerous
work
of
disconnecting
the
mines
so
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
might
go
out
and
in
and
move
about
during
the
in
safety
again
a
little
before
sunset
every
evening
he
went
out
and
reconnected
them
so
that
the
enemy
could
not
approach
the
place
without
the
risk
of
being
blown
to
pieces
at
the
same
time
the
gates
were
closed
and
no
one
was
allowed
to
leave
or
enter
the
town
on
this
particular
evening
the
lieutenant
went
out
as
usual
on
his
dangerous
mission
just
after
six
he
had
not
been
long
gone
when
a
loud
explosion
was
heard
and
a
cloud
of
smoke
was
seen
where
one
of
the
mines
had
been
laid
down
a
party
at
once
sallied
out
and
found
as
they
had
feared
that
the
brave
young
fellow
had
perished
he
had
been
literally
blown
to
pieces
his
head
being
found
in
one
place
while
other
portions
of
his
body
were
scattered
around
this
melancholy
incident
cast
a
gloom
over
the
whole
place
the
remains
of
the
heroic
young
engineer
were
buried
next
day
with
military
honours
the
garrison
was
not
however
left
long
in
peace
to
think
over
his
sad
fate
for
the
very
next
night
a
determined
attack
was
made
all
along
the
line
the
annoying
persistency
of
these
attacks
seemed
to
have
stirred
the
indignation
of
the
general
in
command
for
he
ordered
out
a
small
force
of
cavalry
to
carry
the
war
into
the
enemy
country
critics
say
that
this
act
was
ill
advised
and
that
the
cavalry
should
not
have
been
despatched
without
the
support
of
infantry
critics
are
not
always
or
necessarily
right
indeed
we
may
venture
to
say
that
they
are
often
wrong
we
do
not
pretend
to
judge
but
be
this
as
it
may
the
cavalry
was
ordered
to
destroy
the
village
of
handoub
about
fifteen
miles
inland
on
the
caravan
route
to
berber
and
to
blow
up
the
enemy
magazine
there
the
force
consisted
of
a
troop
of
the
hussars
and
another
of
egyptian
cavalry
about
fifty
men
all
told
under
command
of
captain
apthorp
our
intemperate
friend
johnson
was
one
of
the
little
band
he
was
sober
then
however
as
he
sat
bolt
upright
on
his
powerful
steed
with
a
very
stern
and
grave
visage
for
he
had
a
strong
impression
that
the
duty
before
them
was
no
a
four
hours
ride
brought
them
to
the
village
the
few
arabs
who
dwelt
in
it
fled
at
once
on
their
approach
and
in
a
very
short
time
the
place
was
effectually
destroyed
along
with
a
large
quantity
of
ammunition
but
no
sooner
had
the
soldiers
finished
the
work
and
begun
to
prepare
for
their
return
than
they
discovered
that
a
large
force
of
the
enemy
was
assembling
to
cut
off
their
retreat
no
time
for
thought
after
that
at
least
six
thousand
of
the
foe
having
heard
of
the
expedition
had
crept
down
through
the
thick
bush
from
the
direction
of
hasheen
thirsting
for
vengeance
two
miles
on
the
suakim
side
of
handoub
they
formed
a
line
and
opened
fire
on
the
leading
cavalry
scouts
seeing
that
the
arabs
were
in
such
force
captain
apthorp
at
once
made
for
their
flank
in
the
direction
of
the
at
full
speed
with
horses
fatigued
by
a
fifteen
miles
journey
they
had
to
ride
for
life
it
was
neck
or
nothing
now
the
egyptian
cavalry
under
captain
gregorie
and
accompanied
by
captain
stopford
of
the
grenadier
guards
and
other
officers
followed
closely
as
they
went
along
at
racing
speed
with
more
than
a
dozen
miles
of
wilderness
to
traverse
and
death
behind
them
private
king
of
the
hussars
fell
from
his
horse
wounded
captain
gregorie
came
up
with
him
stopped
and
took
the
wounded
man
up
behind
him
it
was
a
generous
but
desperate
act
for
what
could
be
expected
of
a
horse
in
such
a
region
and
with
such
a
race
before
it
for
about
half
a
mile
he
carried
the
wounded
trooper
who
then
swooned
and
fell
off
dragging
the
captain
along
with
him
the
freed
horse
rejoining
its
troop
while
the
arabs
came
yelling
on
not
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
behind
there
would
have
been
but
little
chance
for
captain
gregorie
at
that
terrible
crisis
if
courage
equal
to
his
own
had
not
dwelt
in
the
breast
of
private
baker
of
the
hussars
seeing
what
had
occurred
this
hero
coolly
rode
back
took
the
captain
up
behind
him
see
frontispiece
and
regaining
his
troop
enabled
the
latter
to
capture
and
remount
his
own
steed
of
course
poor
king
whether
dead
or
alive
they
could
not
tell
had
to
be
left
to
his
fate
heroism
would
seem
to
feed
upon
itself
and
multiply
for
this
same
private
baker
soon
afterwards
saw
two
more
troopers
and
shouted
to
a
comrade
to
turn
back
with
him
to
their
rescue
the
comrade
however
did
not
see
his
way
to
do
so
perchance
he
did
not
hear
anyhow
he
galloped
on
but
captain
gregorie
hearing
the
summons
at
once
answered
it
turned
and
galloped
back
with
baker
they
were
only
just
in
time
to
take
up
and
rescue
the
two
men
at
the
same
time
captain
stopford
performed
a
similar
gallant
act
in
rescuing
a
dismounted
trooper
it
is
deeds
of
and
heroism
such
as
these
not
the
storming
of
a
breach
or
the
fighting
against
overwhelming
odds
that
bring
out
the
noblest
qualities
of
our
soldiers
and
arouse
the
admiration
of
mankind
the
race
for
life
was
so
close
run
that
when
the
force
at
last
reached
the
it
was
little
more
than
sixty
yards
in
advance
of
the
foe
and
so
exhausted
were
the
horses
that
eight
of
them
fell
and
their
riders
were
captured
four
being
englishmen
and
four
egyptians
it
is
right
to
add
that
one
of
the
egyptians
also
displayed
conspicuous
courage
in
rescuing
a
comrade
while
these
stirring
incidents
were
taking
place
on
the
plain
miles
and
some
of
his
comrades
were
seated
on
the
roof
of
the
redoubt
looking
out
anxiously
for
the
return
of
the
cavalry
at
last
in
the
afternoon
a
cloud
of
dust
was
seen
on
the
horizon
and
the
officers
who
had
glasses
could
soon
make
out
that
the
men
appeared
to
be
racing
towards
the
town
at
full
speed
while
the
enemy
on
camels
and
horses
and
on
foot
were
racing
down
to
the
sea
to
cut
off
their
retreat
no
sooner
was
this
understood
than
our
men
rose
with
an
uncontrollable
burst
seized
their
rifles
flung
on
and
rushed
out
to
the
rescue
regardless
for
the
moment
of
the
officers
shouting
to
them
to
come
back
the
news
spread
like
wildfire
and
the
men
ran
out
just
as
they
were
some
in
white
jackets
some
in
red
others
in
blue
many
in
their
shirts
with
their
sleeves
rolled
up
cavalry
artillery
marines
infantry
all
going
towards
the
enemy
fortunately
they
saw
from
the
ships
what
was
going
on
and
quickly
got
their
guns
to
bear
so
that
the
moment
our
men
had
escaped
clear
of
the
enemy
they
opened
fire
but
for
this
more
men
would
certainly
have
been
lost
for
the
overtaxed
horses
were
beginning
to
give
in
and
lose
ground
had
they
been
a
few
minutes
later
in
reaching
the
sea
it
is
probable
that
not
a
man
of
that
force
would
have
returned
to
suakim
as
it
was
the
men
came
in
pale
and
terribly
fatigued
the
horses
could
scarcely
walk
and
two
of
them
died
on
the
following
day
since
the
foregoing
was
written
we
have
learned
with
profound
regret
that
the
gallant
captain
gregorie
was
killed
by
his
horse
falling
with
him
in
chapter
sixteen
letters
from
home
flynn
is
exalted
and
brought
low
rumours
of
war
in
the
air
events
in
life
sometimes
ripple
along
like
the
waters
of
a
little
stream
in
summer
at
other
times
they
rush
with
the
wild
impetuosity
of
a
in
winter
for
some
time
after
the
incidents
just
narrated
the
life
of
our
hero
rippled
but
of
course
it
must
be
clearly
understood
that
a
suakim
ripple
bore
some
resemblance
to
a
respectable
freshet
elsewhere
osman
digna
either
waited
for
reinforcements
before
delivering
a
grand
assault
or
found
sufficient
entertainment
to
his
mind
and
satisfaction
to
his
ambition
in
acting
the
part
of
a
mosquito
by
almost
nightly
harassment
of
the
garrison
which
was
thus
kept
continually
on
the
alert
but
there
came
a
time
at
length
when
a
change
occurred
in
the
at
suakim
events
began
to
evolve
themselves
in
rapid
succession
as
well
as
in
magnified
intensity
until
on
one
particular
day
there
came
metaphorically
speaking
what
is
known
among
the
scottish
hills
as
a
spate
it
began
with
the
arrival
of
a
mail
from
england
this
was
not
indeed
a
matter
of
rare
occurrence
but
it
was
one
of
those
incidents
of
the
campaign
which
never
lost
its
freshness
and
always
sent
a
thrill
of
pleasure
to
the
hearts
of
the
men
powerfully
in
the
case
of
those
who
received
letters
and
packets
sympathetically
in
those
who
got
none
at
long
last
exclaimed
corporal
flynn
who
was
observed
by
his
comrades
after
the
delivery
of
the
mail
to
be
tenderly
struggling
with
the
complicated
folds
of
a
remarkable
letter
remarkable
for
its
crookedness
size
dirt
and
hieroglyphic
superscription
what
is
it
flynn
asked
moses
one
of
the
unfortunates
who
had
received
no
letter
by
that
mail
a
letter
sure
have
ye
got
eyes
moses
from
your
wife
corporal

flynn
with
scorn
no

gift
of
a
wife
gratis
the
letter

from

owld
grandmother
she
better
to

than
a
dozen

rowled
into

cost
her
too
poor
owld

but
she
tear
her
eyes
out
to
plaze
me
she
would
darlint

or
brother
would
have
writ
me
too
but
they
not
half
as
proud
of
me
as
my
shut
up
flynn
cried
one
of
the
men
who
was
trying
to
decipher
a
letter
the
penmanship
of
which
was
obviously
the
work
of
an
unaccustomed
hand
howld
it
upside
down
sometimes
they
easier
to
read
that
way
more
retorted
the
corporal
blessin
on
your
sweet
face
exclaimed
armstrong
looking
at
a
photograph
which
he
had
just
extracted
from
his
letter
hallo
bill
that
your
sweetheart
asked
sergeant
hardy
who
was
busy
untying
a
parcel

answered
the
young
soldier
with
animation
let
me
see
it
willie
said
miles
who
was
also
one
of
the
disconsolate
disconsolate
because
he
had
fully
expected
a
reply
to
the
penitent
letter
which
he
had
written
to
his
mother
that
emmy
to
a
tee
a
splendid
likeness
exclaimed
miles
holding
the
photograph
to
the
light
arrah
then
it
dead
he
must
be
the
extreme
perplexity
displayed
in
flynn
face
as
he
said
this
and
scratched
his
head
produced
a
hearty
laugh
it
no
laughin
matter
boys
cried
the
corporal
looking
up
with
an
expression
so
solemn
that
his
comrades
almost
believed
it
to
be
genuine
there
my
owld
uncle
macgrath
gone
to
his
long
home
an
he

the

no

macgrath

and

cried
one
of
his
comrades
he
left
the
old
woman
a
legacy
the
corporal
did
read
on
and
during
the
perusal
of
the
letter
the
change
in
his
visage
was
marvellous
exhibiting
as
it
did
an
almost
magical
transition
from
profound
woe
through
abrupt
gradations
of
surprise
to
intense
joy
hooray
he
shouted
leaping
up
and
bestowing
a
vigorous
slap
on
his
thigh
he
gone
an
left
the
whole
farm
an
the
beautiful
bog
to
me
what

sergeant
asked
saunders
refolding
the
letter
he
had
been
quietly
perusing
without
paying
any
regard
to
the
good
news
a
parcel
of
booklets
from
the
institute
answered
hardy
turning
over
the
leaves
of
one
of
the
pamphlets
ai
it
good
of
right
you
are
hardy
the
ladies
there
never
forget

said
moses
pyne
hand
round
sergeant
it
does
a
fellow
heart
good
to
get
a
bit
o
readin
in
an
place
like
this
comes
like
light
in
a
dark
place
do
it
comrade
said
stevenson
the
marine
who
paid
them
a
visit
at
that
moment
bringing
a
letter
which
had
been
carried
to
the
wrong
quarter
by
mistake
it
was
for
miles
milton
i
know
you
expected
it
an
would
be
awfully
disappointed
at
finding
nothing
so
i
brought
it
over
at
once
come
like
a
gleam
of
sunshine
in
a
dark
place
thanks
stevenson
many
thanks
said
miles
springing
up
and
opening
the
letter
eagerly
the
first
words
sent
a
chill
to
his
heart
for
it
told
of
his
father
having
been
very
ill
but
words
of
comfort
immediately
followed
he
was
getting
slowly
but
surely
better
and
his
own
letter
had
done
the
old
man
more
good
in
a
few
days
than
all
the
doctor
physic
had
done
in
many
weeks
forgiveness
was
freely
granted
and
unalterable
love
breathed
in
every
line
with
a
relieved
and
thankful
heart
he
went
on
reading
when
he
was
arrested
by
a
sudden
summons
of
his
company
to
fall
in
grasping
his
rifle
he
ran
out
with
the
rest
what
is
it
he
whispered
to
a
sergeant
as
he
took
his
place
in
the
ranks
osman
again
no
he
too
sly
a
fox
to
show
face
in
the
it
a
steamer
coming
with
troops
aboard
we
goin
down
to
receive
them
i
believe
soon
after
the
overworked
garrison
had
the
immense
satisfaction
and
excitement
of
bidding
welcome
to
reinforcements
with
a
stirring
british
cheer
these
formed
only
the
for
some
time
after
that
troops
were
landed
at
suakim
every
day
among
them
the
sikhs
a
splendid
body
of
men
with
grand
physique
and
fierce
aspect
like
men
who
meant
business
then
came
the
coldstream
guards
the
scots
and
the
grenadier
guards
closely
followed
by
the
engineers
and
hospital
and
transport
corps
the
shropshire
regiment
and
many
others
the
desire
of
these
fresh
troops
to
meet
the
enemy
was
naturally
strong
and
the
earnest
hope
of
every
one
was
that
they
would
soon
sally
forth
and
have
a
go
as
corporal
flynn
expressed
it
at
osman
digna
on
his
own
ground
poor
corporal
flynn
his
days
of
soldiering
were
nearly
over
whether
it
was
the
excess
of
strong
feeling
raised
in
the
poor
breast
by
the
news
of
the
grand
and
unexpected
legacy
or
the
excitement
caused
by
the
arrival
of
so
many
splendid
troops
and
the
prospect
of
immediate
action
or
all
put
together
we
can
not
say
but
certain
it
is
that
the
corporal
fell
sick
and
when
the
doctors
examined
the
men
with
a
view
to
decide
who
should
march
to
the
front
and
who
should
remain
to
guard
the
town
he
was
pronounced
unfit
for
active
service
worse
than
that
he
was
reported
to
have
entered
upon
that
journey
from
which
no
traveller
returns
but
poor
flynn
would
not
admit
it
though
he
grew
weaker
from
day
to
day
at
last
it
was
reported
that
he
was
dying
and
sergeant
hardy
got
leave
to
go
off
to
the
hospital
ship
to
see
him
and
convey
to
him
many
a
kind
message
from
his
sorrowful
comrades
who
felt
that
the
regiment
could
ill
spare
his
lively
humorous
spirit
the
sergeant
found
him
the
picture
of
death
and
almost
too
weak
to
speak
my
dear
fellow
said
hardy
sitting
down
by
his
cot
and
gently
taking
his
hand
i
sorry
to
see
you
like
this
i
afraid
you
are
goin
to
leave
us
the
corporal
made
a
slight
motion
with
his
head
as
if
of
dissent
and
his
lips
moved
hardy
bent
his
ear
over
them
niver
a
bit
owld
man
whispered
flynn
shall
i
read
the
bible
to
you
lad
inquired
the
sergeant
the
corporal
smiled
faintly
and
nodded
after
reading
a
few
verses
hardy
began
to
talk
kindly
and
earnestly
to
the
dying
man
who
lay
with
his
eyes
closed
when
he
was
about
to
leave
flynn
looked
up
and
giving
his
hand
a
gentle
squeeze
said
in
a
stronger
whisper
than
before
thankee
sergeant
it
kind
o
ye
to
be
so
consarned
about
my
sowl
and
i
agrees
wid
ivery
word
ye
say
but
i
not
goin
away
yit
av
ye
plaze
he
ceased
to
speak
and
again
closed
his
eyes
the
doctor
and
the
chaplain
chanced
to
enter
the
hospital
together
as
hardy
retired
the
result
of
their
visit
was
that
they
said
the
corporal
was
dead
and
orders
were
given
to
make
his
coffin
a
firing
party
was
also
told
off
to
bury
him
the
next
morning
with
military
honours
early
next
morning
accordingly
the
firing
party
started
for
the
hospital
ship
with
the
coffin
but
before
getting
to
it
they
were
signalled
to
go
back
for
the
man
was
not
yet
dead
in
short
corporal
flynn
had
begun
to
talk
in
a
wild
way
about
his
estate
in
ireland
and
his
owld
grandmother
and
either
the
influence
of
these
thoughts
or
hardy
visit
had
given
him
such
a
fillip
that
from
that
day
he
began
to
revive
nevertheless
he
had
received
a
very
severe
shake
and
not
very
long
after
was
invalided
home
meanwhile
as
we
have
said
busy
preparations
were
being
made
by
general
graham
who
had
arrived
and
taken
command
of
the
forces
to
offer
battle
to
troops
in
the
midst
of
all
the
excitement
and
turmoil
however
the
new
chaplain
who
turned
out
to
be
a
trump
managed
to
hold
a
temperance
meeting
and
the
men
who
desired
to
serve
god
as
well
as
their
queen
and
country
became
more
energetic
than
ever
in
trying
to
influence
their
fellows
and
save
themselves
from
the
curse
of
strong
drink
which
had
already
played
such
havoc
among
the
troops
at
suakim
miles
attended
the
meeting
and
according
to
promise
signed
the
pledge
owing
to
the
postponement
of
meetings
and
the
press
of
duty
he
had
not
been
able
to
do
it
sooner
shortly
after
that
he
was
passed
by
the
doctors
as
fit
for
duty
in
the
field
so
were
armstrong
moses
pyne
and
most
of
those
strong
and
healthy
men
whose
fortunes
we
have
followed
thus
far
then
came
the
bustle
and
excitement
of
preparation
to
go
out
and
attack
the
enemy
and
in
the
midst
of
it
all
the
air
was
full
of
conflicting
rumours
to
the
effect
that
osman
digna
was
about
to
surrender
unconditionally
that
he
would
attack
the
town
in
force
that
he
was
dead
or
that
he
had
been
summoned
to
a
conference
by
the
mahdi
you
may
rest
assured
said
sergeant
hardy
one
day
to
his
comrades
as
they
were
smoking
their
pipes
after
dinner
that
nobody
knows
anything
at
all
for
certain
about
the
rebel
chief
i
heard
that
a
spy
has
just
come
in
with
the
information
that
he
has
determined
not
to
wait
for
our
attack
if
we
go
out
but
to
attack
us
in
our
zereba
said
miles
he
is
evidently
resolved
not
to
commit
the
same
mistake
he
made
last
year
of
letting
us
attack
he
has
pluck
for
anything
remarked
moses
osman
proved
that
same
evening
that
he
had
at
least
pluck
enough
to
send
a
pithy
defiance
to
his
foes
for
an
insulting
letter
was
received
by
general
graham
in
which
osman
recounting
the
victories
he
had
gained
over
hicks
and
baker
pasha
boasted
of
his
having
destroyed
their
armies
and
dared
the
general
to
come
out
and
fight
him
to
this
the
british
general
replied
reminding
osman
of
our
victories
of
and
tamai
and
advising
him
to
surrender
unless
he
wanted
a
worse
beating
than
he
had
got
before
mutual
defiance
having
been
thus
comfortably
hurled
the
troops
were
at
once
detailed
for
service
in
the
field
and
the
very
next
day
set
forth
as
our
hero
did
not
however
accompany
that
expedition
and
as
it
returned
to
suakim
without
doing
anything
remarkable
except
some
energetic
and
even
heroic
fighting
which
is
by
no
means
remarkable
in
british
troops
we
will
pass
on
to
the
expedition
which
was
sent
out
immediately
after
it
and
in
which
miles
milton
not
only
took
an
active
part
but
distinguished
himself
with
several
of
his
comrades
he
also
entered
on
a
new
and
somewhat
unusual
phase
of
a
soldier
career
chapter
seventeen
the
expedition
enemy
reported
miles
in
a
dilemma
every
one
has
heard
of
the
expedition
sent
out
under
sir
john
mcneill
in
which
that
gallant
general
and
his
brave
troops
fought
with
indomitable
heroism
not
only
against
courageous
foes
but
against
errors
which
as
a
civilian
we
will
not
presume
to
criticise
and
against
local
difficulties
which
were
said
to
be
absolutely
insurmountable
blame
was
due
somewhere
in
connection
with
that
expedition
wherever
it
lay
we
have
a
strong
conviction
founded
on
the
opinion
of
one
who
was
present
that
it
did
not
rest
with
the
commander
of
the
force
it
is
not
however
our
part
to
comment
but
to
describe
those
events
which
bore
upon
the
fortunes
of
our
hero
and
his
immediate
friends
and
comrades
it
was
about
four
on
an
uncommonly
hot
morning
that
the
bugle
sounded
in
suakim
and
soon
the
place
was
alive
with
men
of
all
arms
devouring
a
hasty
breakfast
and
mustering
eagerly
for
they
were
elated
at
the
near
prospect
of
having
another
slap
at
osman
strange
the
unaccountably
exultant
joy
which
so
many
men
experience
at
the
prospect
of
killing
each
other
no
doubt
the
briton
maintains
that
it
is
all
in
defence
of
queen
and
country
hearth
and
home
an
excellent
reason
of
course
but
may
not
the
soudanese
claim
that
the
defence
of
chief
and
country
tent
and
home
is
an
equally
good
reason
especially
when
he
rises
to
defend
himself
from
the
exactions
and
cruelty
of
those
superlative
tyrants
the
turks
or
rather
the
turkish
pashas
for
we
verily
believe
that
the
rank
and
file
of
all
civilised
nations
would
gladly
live
at
peace
if
their
rulers
would
deal
in
arbitration
instead
of
war
we
almost
feel
that
an
apology
is
due
for
introducing
such
a
remark
in
a
book
about
soldiers
for
their
duty
is
clear
as
well
as
hard
and
bravely
is
it
done
too
moreover
they
are
in
no
way
responsible
for
the
deeds
of
those
fine
old
english
gentlemen
who
sit
at
home
at
ease
and
send
them
forth
to
fight
and
die
beyond
the
stormy
seas
the
troops
composing
this
expedition
consisted
of
one
squadron
of
the
lancers
one
battalion
berkshire
regiment
one
battalion
of
marines
one
field
company
royal
engineers
a
detachment
of
the
royal
navy
in
charge
of
four
gardner
guns
a
regiment
of
sikhs
bengal
native
infantry
bombay
native
infantry
and
a
body
of
madras
sappers
along
with
these
was
sent
an
immense
convoy
of
camels
besides
a
large
number
of
mules
with
carts
bearing
iron
the
orders
for
the
expedition
were
that
they
should
proceed
eight
miles
into
the
bush
and
there
make
three
zerebas
or
defensive
enclosures
of
bushes
capable
of
sheltering
the
entire
force
the
march
was
begun
by
mcneill
moving
off
with
his
european
troops
in
square
formation
the
indian
contingent
under
general
hudson
followed
also
in
square
and
in
charge
of
the
transport
a
goodly
force
remarked
armstrong
in
a
low
tone
to
miles
as
they
stepped
off
shoulder
to
shoulder
for
being
both
about
the
same
size
and
unusually
tall
they
marched
together
on
the
right
flank
of
their
company
do
speak
in
the
ranks
willie
returned
miles
with
a
slight
smile
for
he
could
not
shut
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
this
strict
regard
for
orders
was
due
more
to
marion
drew
remarks
about
a
soldier
than
to
principle
h
grunted
robert
macleod
who
marched
next
to
them
and
had
no
conscientious
scruples
about
talking
we
may
mairch
oot
smert
eneugh
but
some
o
us
no
come
back
sae
hearty
some
of
us
will
never
come
back
at
all
replied
armstrong
gravely
by
six
the
had
left
suakim
and
the
whole
of
the
force
moved
across
the
plain
in
parts
of
which
the
men
and
carts
sank
deep
in
the
soft
sand
while
in
other
parts
the
formations
were
partly
broken
by
thick
bush
in
which
the
force
became
somewhat
entangled
the
cavalry
went
in
advance
as
scouts
the
guns
and
were
in
the
centre
and
the
indian
brigade
came
last
surrounding
the
unwieldy
mass
of
last
of
all
came
the
telegraph
detachment
unrolling
as
they
went
the
wire
that
kept
open
communication
with
that
a
mistake
had
been
made
somewhere
was
obvious
but
as
the
soul
of
military
discipline
is
obedience
without
question
the
gallant
leader
pressed
forward
silently
and
steadily
whatever
he
may
have
thought
soon
the
force
became
so
hopelessly
entangled
in
the
difficulties
of
the
way
that
the
rate
of
advance
dwindled
down
to
little
more
than
one
mile
an
hour
not
long
after
starting
a
trooper
was
seen
galloping
back
and
miles
who
marched
at
the
right
corner
of
his
square
observed
that
it
was
his
friend
johnson
looking
very
stern
indeed
their
eyes
met
not
half
enough
of
cavalry
he
growled
as
he
flew
past
to
report
the
enemy
in
sight
retiring
in
small
parties
in
the
direction
of
tamai
in
returning
johnson
again
rode
close
past
the
same
corner
of
the
square
and
bending
low
in
his
saddle
for
a
moment
said
to
miles
i
have
signed
the
pledge
my
boy
a
slight
laugh
from
several
of
those
who
heard
him
greeted
the
information
but
he
probably
did
not
hear
it
for
next
moment
his
charger
cleared
a
low
bush
in
a
magnificent
stride
and
in
a
few
seconds
man
and
horse
were
lost
to
sight
in
the
bush
more
need
to
sign
his
will
remarked
simkin
in
a
somewhat
cynical
tone
he
has
done
that
too
said
armstrong
i
heard
him
say
so
before
we
started
the
troops
were
halted
to
enable
the
two
generals
to
consult
at
this
point
while
the
men
stood
at
ease
enjoying
the
brief
rest
from
severe
toil
under
such
a
burning
sun
our
hero
heard
a
low
voice
at
his
elbow
say
have
signed
your
will
john
miles
it
was
a
startling
as
well
as
a
sudden
question
miles
turned
quickly
and
found
that
it
was
captain
lacey
who
had
put
it
the
feeling
of
dislike
with
which
our
young
soldier
had
regarded
the
captain
ever
since
his
interruption
of
the
conversation
between
himself
and
marion
on
board
ship
had
abated
but
had
not
by
any
means
disappeared
he
had
too
much
sense
however
to
allow
the
state
of
his
feelings
to
influence
his
looks
or
bearing
yes
sir
he
replied
i
made
it
out
last
night
as
you
advised
me
in
the
service
form
it
was
witnessed
by
our
colonel
and
captain
smart
and
the
doctor
to
say
truth
i
thought
it
absurd
for
a
man
who
has
nothing
to
leave
to
make
his
will
but
as
you
said
sir
i
should
like
my
dear
mother
to
get
my
kit
and
any
arrears
of
pay
that
may
be
due
to
me
after
i
gone
i
did
not
mean
you
to
take
such
a
gloomy
view
of
your
prospects
said
captain
lacey
with
a
laugh
but
you
know
in
our
profession
we
always
carry
our
lives
in
our
hands
and
it
would
be
foolish
not
to
take
ordinary
precautions
the
order
to
resume
the
march
here
cut
short
the
conversation
and
the
force
continued
its
slow
and
all
but
impossible
advance
indeed
it
was
soon
seen
that
to
reach
the
distance
of
eight
miles
out
in
the
circumstances
was
quite
beyond
the
power
of
the
troops
willing
anxious
and
vigorous
though
they
were
for
the
bush
became
closer
and
higher
as
they
advanced
so
that
a
mounted
man
could
not
see
over
it
and
so
dense
that
the
squares
though
only
a
short
distance
apart
could
not
see
each
other
this
state
of
things
rendered
the
management
of
the
extremely
difficult
for
mules
are
proverbially
intractable
and
camels
so
meek
in
pictures
are
perhaps
the
most
snarling
biting
kicking
animals
in
the
world
the
day
was
advancing
and
the
heat
increasing
while
the
dust
raised
by
the
passage
of
such
a
host
caused
so
much
distress
to
man
and
beast
that
the
general
began
to
fear
that
if
an
attack
should
be
made
by
the
enemy
at
that
time
the
greater
part
of
the
transport
would
have
to
be
sacrificed
the
force
was
therefore
halted
a
second
time
and
the
generals
again
met
to
consult
they
were
very
unwilling
to
give
in
another
effort
to
advance
was
made
but
things
grew
worse
and
worse
the
day
as
moses
remarked
was
boiling
the
carts
with
the
heavy
sank
deep
in
the
soft
sand
many
of
the
camels
loads
fell
off
and
these
had
to
be
replaced
replacing
a
camel
load
implies
prevailing
on
a
hideously
tall
and
horribly
stubborn
creature
to
kneel
and
this
in
the
centre
of
a
square
which
was
already
blocked
up
with
carts
and
animals
as
well
as
shouting
angry
and
exhausted
drivers
at
last
it
became
evident
that
further
progress
that
day
was
out
of
the
question
the
rear
face
of
hudson
square
was
obliterated
by
the
straggling
and
struggling
multitude
camels
and
loads
were
down
in
all
directions
and
despair
of
maintaining
their
formation
was
settling
down
on
all
ranks
in
these
circumstances
it
became
absolutely
necessary
to
halt
and
form
their
zerebas
where
they
stood
and
that
without
delay
the
best
place
they
could
find
was
selected
the
european
square
formed
a
guard
while
the
rest
threw
off
jackets
and
with
axes
and
choppers
went
to
work
with
a
will
some
cut
down
bushes
some
filled
sandbags
to
form
a
breastwork
for
guns
and
ammunition
and
others
erected
the
bushy
walls
of
their
woodland
fortification
the
lancers
covered
about
three
miles
of
country
as
scouts
hudson
who
had
to
return
to
suakim
that
night
before
dark
was
ordered
with
three
regiments
in
line
and
advanced
files
to
cover
mcneill
and
the
while
the
commander
himself
went
about
encouraging
the
tired
men
and
urging
them
to
increased
exertion
while
the
soldiers
of
all
arms
were
thus
busily
engaged
a
body
of
sailors
was
ordered
to
run
one
of
their
gardner
guns
up
to
the
corner
of
the
square
where
miles
and
armstrong
stood
they
halted
close
to
them
and
then
miles
became
aware
that
one
of
the
nautical
gunners
was
no
other
than
jack
molloy
hallo
jack
why
you
got
a
knack
of
turning
up
unexpectedly
everywhere
he
exclaimed
when
his
friend
was
at
leisure
that
wery
much
your
own
case
retorted
the
seaman
heartily
what
brought
here
miles
slapped
one
of
his
legs
by
way
of
indicating
the
mode
of
conveyance
ay
lad
and
they
need
to
be
stout
timbers
too
to
make
headway
through
such
a
sea
of
sand
returned
molloy
feeling
his
own
limbs
with
tenderness
think
we
in
for
a
brush
lad
before
the
latter
could
reply
an
ran
up
and
spoke
a
few
hurried
words
to
captain
lacey
who
turned
to
his
company
and
called
them
to
attention
fours
right
quick
march
he
said
and
away
they
went
past
the
flank
of
hudson
men
to
guard
a
hollow
which
left
that
part
of
the
square
somewhat
exposed
when
halted
and
drawn
up
in
line
several
files
were
thrown
out
in
advance
miles
and
sutherland
formed
the
flanking
file
on
the
right
the
latter
being
man
to
the
former
it
a
grand
observed
sutherland
as
he
peered
cautiously
over
the
edge
of
a
low
bank
into
a
hollow
where
rocks
and
undergrowth
were
thickly
intermingled
keep
a
sharp
on
your
left
sutherland
said
miles
i
will
guard
the
right
he
stopped
abruptly
and
threw
forward
his
rifle
for
at
that
moment
he
observed
a
swarthy
arab
of
large
proportions
and
muscular
frame
creeping
forward
a
short
distance
below
him
evidently
he
had
not
heard
or
seen
the
approach
of
the
two
soldiers
for
he
was
gazing
in
a
different
direction
from
them
miles
raised
his
rifle
and
took
aim
at
the
man
but
he
felt
an
unconquerable
repugnance
to
shoot
he
had
never
yet
met
the
enemy
his
experience
heretofore
had
been
confined
to
firing
at
men
who
were
firing
at
himself
and
his
comrades
and
in
which
of
course
he
could
not
be
sure
that
his
bullets
took
effect
but
now
he
was
within
fifty
yards
of
a
man
who
did
not
see
him
who
was
at
the
moment
innocent
of
any
intention
of
injuring
him
and
whose
expressive
he
could
clearly
distinguish
as
he
crept
along
with
great
caution
towards
a
rock
which
hid
the
zereba
of
the
europeans
from
his
view
miles
was
a
good
a
touch
of
the
trigger
he
knew
would
be
certain
death
to
the
arab
i
do
it
he
muttered
as
he
lowered
his
weapon
and
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
at
his
comrade
the
scot
who
was
something
of
a
naturalist
was
engrossed
at
the
moment
in
the
contemplation
of
a
little
bird
which
was
twittering
on
a
twig
in
quite
an
opposite
direction
miles
glanced
again
at
the
arab
in
a
flutter
of
agitation
as
to
what
was
his
duty
the
man
be
one
of
the
friendly
natives
he
could
not
tell
at
that
moment
another
man
appeared
on
the
scene
he
was
a
thin
but
powerful
native
and
armed
with
a
short
spear
such
as
is
used
when
fighting
at
close
quarters
he
obviously
was
not
troubled
with
scruples
about
committing
murder
and
miles
soon
became
aware
that
the
thin
man
was
stalking
the
big
arab
with
what
intent
of
course
our
soldier
could
only
guess
but
the
malignant
expression
of
the
countenance
left
little
doubt
on
that
point
here
was
a
complication
our
hero
was
on
the
point
of
calling
sutherland
from
the
contemplation
of
his
little
bird
when
he
saw
the
thin
native
pounce
on
the
arab
who
was
still
creeping
on
hands
and
knees
he
turned
just
in
time
to
divert
the
first
but
not
in
time
to
draw
his
own
long
knife
from
its
sheath
as
he
fell
the
thin
savage
holding
him
down
and
having
him
at
terrible
disadvantage
on
his
back
raised
his
spear
and
was
about
to
repeat
the
deadly
thrust
when
miles
fired
and
shot
him
in
the
head
the
arab
rose
shook
himself
clear
of
the
dying
man
and
with
astounding
coolness
walked
calmly
towards
a
large
rock
though
miles
was
reloading
in
haste
and
sutherland
was
taking
steady
aim
at
him
he
looked
at
the
soldiers
and
held
up
his
hand
with
something
like
a
smile
of
remonstrance
as
sutherland
pulled
the
trigger
at
the
same
moment
miles
struck
up
the
muzzle
and
the
ball
whizzed
over
the
arab
head
as
he
passed
behind
the
rock
and
disappeared
what
for
did
ye
that
demanded
the
scot
fiercely
would
you
kill
a
man
that
was
smiling
at
you
retorted
miles
the
two
men
ran
back
to
report
to
their
company
what
they
had
seen
at
the
same
moment
the
company
being
recalled
doubled
back
to
its
position
in
the
square
here
they
found
the
defence
work
so
far
advanced
that
the
generals
were
beginning
to
feel
some
confidence
in
their
being
able
to
repel
any
attack
at
the
same
time
the
men
were
working
with
tremendous
energy
for
news
had
just
come
in
that
the
enemy
was
advancing
in
strong
force
chapter
eighteen
wherein
are
described
an
assault
a
furious
fight
and
some
strange
personal
encounters
it
was
nearly
two
in
the
afternoon
when
captain
lacey
and
his
company
resumed
their
place
in
the
square
about
that
time
an
officer
of
the
berkshire
regiment
represented
the
condition
of
his
men
as
requiring
attention
they
certainly
did
require
it
for
they
had
been
without
food
since
four
that
morning
and
were
consequently
in
urgent
need
of
provender
as
well
as
rest
and
water
the
last
having
been
all
consumed
as
it
was
imperative
that
the
work
should
go
on
it
was
found
necessary
to
serve
out
food
by
wings
accordingly
the
men
of
one
received
rations
and
water
and
were
then
sent
to
their
zereba
with
the
gardner
guns
while
the
other
half
still
lying
in
reserve
by
their
piled
arms
received
their
rations
the
marines
also
sat
down
for
brief
rest
and
refreshment
among
them
was
our
sedate
friend
stevenson
who
invariably
carried
his
small
bible
with
him
in
all
his
campaigns
after
quickly
consuming
his
allowance
and
while
waiting
for
water
he
sat
down
to
read
a
few
verses
of
the
psalm
for
stevenson
was
one
of
those
quiet
fearless
men
who
can
not
be
laughed
out
of
doing
right
and
who
have
no
fear
of
the
face
of
man
whether
scowling
in
anger
or
sneering
in
contempt
hallo

pouch

queer
time
to

word
but

an
unsuitable
time

may
be
the
last
chance

stevenson
was
yet
speaking
when
a
lancer
was
seen
approaching
at
a
wild
gallop
he
dashed
up
to
the
generals
and
informed
them
that
the
enemy
was
gathering
in
front
the
message
was
barely
delivered
when
another
lancer
rode
up
and
reported
the
enemy
close
at
hand
the
order
stand
to
your
arms
was
promptly
given
and
as
promptly
obeyed
without
flurry
or
disorder
next
minute
a
wild
uproar
was
heard
and
the
lancers
were
seen
galloping
towards
the
square
with
thousands
of
the
swarthy
warriors
of
the
desert
at
their
heels
nay
even
mixed
up
with
them
on
they
came
a
dark
frantic
yelling
host
with
irresistible
fury
and
perchance
patriotism
shall
we
deny
to
those
men
what
we
claim
for
ourselves
love
of
hearth
and
home
of
country
of
freedom
can
we
not
sympathise
with
men
who
groaned
under
an
insolent
and
tyrannical
yoke
and
who
failing
to
understand
or
appreciate
the
purity
of
the
motives
by
which
we
british
were
actuated
could
see
nothing
in
us
except
the
supporters
of
their
enemies
they
hurled
themselves
on
that
part
of
the
large
zereba
which
was
defended
by
the
bengal
native
infantry
these
fired
a
volley
but
failed
to
check
the
impetuous
rush
everything
went
down
before
the
savages
and
the
native
infantry
broke
and
fled
throwing
into
dire
confusion
the
transport
animals
which
stood
in
their
immediate
rear
general
mcneill
himself
dashed
in
among
the
men
and
sought
to
arrest
them
he
succeeded
for
a
time
in
rallying
some
of
them
in
number
zereba
but
another
rush
of
the
arabs
sent
them
flying
a
second
time
and
some
of
the
enemy
got
into
the
square
it
is
said
to
the
number
of
the
berkshire
men
however
stood
fast
and
not
a
soul
who
got
into
that
square
ever
got
out
of
it
alive
in
this
wretched
affair
the
bengal
native
infantry
lost
their
brave
commander
he
was
killed
while
trying
to
rally
them
the
confusion
was
now
increased
by
the
enemy
driving
the
hither
and
thither
especially
on
to
another
square
of
the
berkshire
regiment
here
however
they
were
effectually
checked
as
the
atlantic
billows
burst
in
impotent
turmoil
on
the
cliffs
of
cornwall
so
the
enemy
fell
upon
and
were
hurled
back
by
the
steadfast
berkshire
regiment
which
scarcely
lost
a
man
while
over
two
hundred
of
their
opponents
lay
dead
around
them
the
bombay
regiment
also
stood
fast
and
redeemed
to
some
extent
the
credit
of
their
country
while
the
sikhs
as
might
have
been
expected
of
them
never
flinched
for
a
moment
but
strewed
the
plain
around
them
with
dead
and
dying
men
there
was
horrible
carnage
for
some
time
unflinching
valour
being
opposed
to
desperate
courage
and
while
a
burning
sense
of
injury
with
a
resolve
to
conquer
or
die
was
the
motive
power
no
doubt
on
one
side
on
the
other
there
was
the
high
sense
of
duty
to
queen
and
country
and
the
pride
of
historical
renown
owing
to
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
and
the
occupation
of
the
troops
at
the
moment
there
was
some
mixing
up
of
men
of
different
regiments
one
company
of
sikhs
who
were
helping
to
unload
the
camels
when
the
fight
began
having
been
prevented
from
joining
their
own
regiment
cast
in
their
lot
with
the
marines
the
better
to
help
their
european
comrades
these
vigorous
fellows
leaped
outside
the
zereba
and
lay
down
in
front
of
it
and
the
two
bodies
together
gave
the
charging
foe
such
a
warm
reception
that
they
never
got
within
twenty
yards
of
them
but
there
was
a
fearful
scene
of
butchery
among
the
and
many
unequal
conflicts
there
was
terrible
slaughter
also
among
the
working
parties
that
had
gone
out
to
cut
bushes
with
which
to
finish
the
zerebas
with
coats
off
and
away
from
their
arms
some
individuals
of
the
marines
who
as
a
body
suffered
severely
were
surrounded
by
a
dozen
arabs
and
their
bodies
were
afterwards
found
covered
with
this
was
the
case
with
a
sergeant
named
mitchel
who
had
charge
of
a
party
and
had
been
quietly
chatting
with
our
friend
stevenson
just
before
the
attack
another
case
was
that
of
private
stanton
who
had
been
through
the
egyptian
campaign
of
had
fought
at
kassassin
and
tamai
when
this
expedition
of
which
we
write
was
arranged
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
volunteer
he
chanced
to
be
outside
the
zereba
when
the
attack
was
made
and
failed
to
appear
at
muster
next
day
he
was
found
dead
with
many
at
some
distance
from
the
force
poor
fellow
he
had
not
been
killed
outright
and
had
attempted
to
crawl
towards
the
zerebas
but
in
his
confusion
had
crept
away
in
the
wrong
direction
and
had
slowly
bled
to
death
on
the
sands
of
the
desert
during
the
rapid
progress
of
this
terrible
scene
of
bloodshed
miles
and
his
friend
armstrong
stood
and
fought
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
the
front
rank
at
their
allotted
corner
of
the
square
chiefly
with
bullet
but
also
on
several
occasions
with
bayonet
when
the
rush
of
the
enemy
threatened
to
break
through
all
barriers
and
drive
in
the
line
of
defenders
they
would
certainly
have
succeeded
had
these
defenders
been
less
powerful
and
resolute
well
done
exclaimed
a
deep
bass
voice
in
evident
enthusiasm
close
to
miles
the
latter
glanced
round
it
was
the
voice
of
his
friend
jack
molloy
who
helped
to
work
the
gardner
gun
and
who
was
at
the
moment
admiring
the
daring
act
of
an
officer
of
sikhs
two
men
of
the
berkshire
regiment
who
had
been
employed
outside
the
zereba
were
pursued
by
several
arabs
and
it
was
evident
that
their
death
was
almost
certain
when
the
sikh
officer
referred
to
rushed
out
to
the
rescue
sprang
between
the
men
and
their
pursuers
killed
three
of
the
latter
in
succession
with
three
rapid
and
enabled
the
soldiers
to
escape
besides
which
he
checked
the
rush
at
that
part
of
the
square
and
returned
to
his
post
in
safety
the
cheer
of
the
berkshire
men
and
others
who
witnessed
this
feat
was
heard
to
rise
above
even
the
yells
of
combatants
the
shrieks
of
the
wounded
the
rattle
and
crash
of
and
the
general
turmoil
and
din
of
war
in
one
of
the
working
parties
that
were
out
when
the
assault
began
was
our
friend
moses
pyne
and
his
comrade
rattling
bill
simkin
these
had
been
separated
from
the
rest
of
their
party
when
the
first
wild
rush
was
made
by
the
foe
the
formation
of
the
ground
favoured
their
dropping
into
a
place
of
concealment
thus
for
the
moment
saving
them
from
the
fate
of
being
surrounded
and
cut
to
pieces
like
too
many
of
their
straggling
comrades
for
a
few
seconds
they
lay
close
while
the
enemy
rushed
past
like
a
torrent
to
the
assault
just
described
then
moses
uprose
with
an
expression
of
stern
resolve
on
his
usually
meek
countenance
simkin
he
said
as
his
comrade
also
got
up
i
not
goin
to
lie
hidin
here
while
our
boys
are
engaged
wi
the
savages
no
more
am
i
moses
returned
rattling
bill
with
something
of
the
jovially
reckless
air
still
lingering
on
his
solemnised
visage
but
we
not
much
chance
of
getting
back
to
the
zerebas
without
arms
what
call
asked
moses
holding
out
his
chopper
a
very
good
weapon
to
fight
the
bush
with
answered
simkin
but
not
worth
much
against
arab
spears
however
comrade
choppers
are
all
we
have
got
so
we
must
make
the
most
of
they
say
a
good
workman
can
work
with
any
tools
what
propose
to
try
i
put
myself
under
your
orders
moses
for
although
you
are
a
meekish
sort
of
a
fellow
i
really
believe
you
have
a
better
headpiece
than
most
of
us
i
propose
that
we
simply
go
at
said
moses
take
in
rear
cut
our
way
through
and
get
into
the
zereba
that
all
it
do
take
much
of
a
headpiece
to
think
that
out
go
ahead
then
i
back
you
said
rattling
bill
without
the
least
touch
of
bravado
as
he
bared
his
right
arm
to
the
shoulder
both
men
were
in
shirts
and
trousers
with
sleeves
tucked
up
and
their
brawny
arms
exposed
arabesquely
brown
up
to
the
elbow
and
infantinely
white
above
that
the
intended
rush
might
have
been
successful
but
for
a
change
in
the
tactics
of
the
enemy
seeing
that
they
were
severely
repulsed
at
the
corner
of
the
square
where
molloy
and
his
tars
worked
the
gardner
gun
while
miles
and
his
comrades
plied
bullet
and
bayonet
the
arab
chief
sent
a
body
of
his
followers
to
reinforce
this
point
it
was
just
at
the
moment
that
moses
and
simkin
made
the
dash
from
their
place
of
concealment
so
that
they
actually
leaped
without
having
intended
it
into
the
very
midst
of
the
reinforcements
two
of
the
arabs
went
down
before
the
choppers
instantly
and
the
others
almost
by
the
suddenness
and
severity
of
the
assault
turned
to
fly
supposing
no
doubt
that
an
ambush
had
caught
them
but
seeing
only
two
men
they
ran
back
and
would
certainly
have
made
short
work
of
them
if
rescuers
had
not
come
up
and
at
this
point
in
the
fight
there
was
exhibited
a
curious
instance
of
the
power
of
friendship
to
render
steady
men
reckless
the
incident
we
have
just
described
was
witnessed
by
the
troops
for
the
moment
the
two
soldiers
left
their
place
of
concealment
they
were
in
full
view
of
the
large
zereba
that
moses
exclaimed
armstrong
excitedly
without
a
moment
hesitation
he
sprang
over
the
and
ran
to
the
rescue
clubbing
his
rifle
as
he
went
and
felling
two
arabs
therewith
you
sha
die
alone
willie
muttered
our
hero
as
he
also
leaped
the
fence
and
followed
his
friend
just
in
time
to
save
him
from
three
arabs
who
made
at
him
simultaneously
two
of
these
miles
knocked
down
his
comrade
felled
the
other
then
they
turned
back
to
back
moses
and
simkin
did
the
same
and
thus
formed
a
little
rallying
square
this
delayed
the
catastrophe
which
seemed
however
inevitable
the
brave
little
quartette
being
surrounded
by
foes
could
do
nothing
but
parry
with
almost
lightning
speed
the
that
were
made
at
them
continually
seeing
this
the
heart
of
jack
molloy
bounded
within
him
and
friendship
for
the
moment
overcame
the
sense
of
duty
you
can
only
die
once
jack
he
exclaimed
drew
his
cutlass
leaped
out
of
the
zereba
and
went
at
the
foe
with
a
thunderous
roar
which
for
a
moment
actually
made
them
quail
infected
with
a
similar
spirit
stevenson
the
marine
also
lost
his
head
if
we
may
say
so
resolving
to
run
for
friendship
sake
he
followed
the
sailor
and
increased
the
rallying
square
to
five
while
molloy
skirmished
round
it
parrying
at
once
with
left
arm
and
cutlass
in
quite
a
miraculous
manner
roaring
all
the
time
like
an
infuriated
lion
and
causing
the
enemy
to
give
back
in
horror
wherever
he
made
a
rush
a
root
however
tripped
him
up
at
last
and
he
fell
forward
headlong
to
the
ground
a
dozen
spears
were
pointed
at
his
broad
back
when
a
tall
majestic
arab
sprang
forward
and
held
up
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
waved
a
sword
at
that
moment
a
strong
force
of
the
enemy
came
down
with
an
impetuous
rush
on
that
corner
of
the
zereba
and
coming
between
it
and
the
little
knot
of
combatants
hid
them
from
view
the
attack
at
this
point
was
very
determined
and
for
a
few
moments
the
issue
seemed
doubtful
for
although
the
enemy
fell
in
heaps
they
came
on
in
such
numbers
that
the
defenders
were
almost
overwhelmed
steadiness
however
combined
with
indomitable
courage
prevailed
everywhere
they
were
repulsed
with
tremendous
loss
many
instances
of
personal
bravery
occurred
of
course
besides
those
we
have
described
but
we
may
not
pause
to
enumerate
these
tenacity
of
life
also
was
curiously
exhibited
in
the
case
of
some
of
the
desperately
wounded
one
man
in
charge
of
two
mules
outside
the
zereba
was
trying
to
bring
them
in
when
he
was
attacked
and
received
three
terrible
in
the
back
and
one
in
the
arm
which
cut
all
the
muscles
and
sinews
yet
this
man
ultimately
recovered
though
of
course
with
the
loss
of
his
arm
another
man
lost
a
leg
and
an
arm
and
was
badly
wounded
in
the
other
leg
and
in
the
hand
and
lastly
he
was
shot
in
the
jaw
after
being
operated
on
and
having
his
wounds
dressed
the
doctor
asked
him
how
he
felt
all
right
sir
he
answered
they
crippled
me
in
arms
and
legs
and
they
broke
my
jaw
but
thank
god
they
have
not
broke
my
heart
yet
it
was
eight
minutes
to
three
when
the
arabs
made
their
first
rush
and
it
was
just
ten
minutes
past
three
when
the
enemy
was
finally
repelled
and
the
bugle
sounded
cease
firing
yet
into
these
pregnant
eighteen
minutes
all
that
we
have
described
and
a
vast
deal
more
was
crowded
nearly
four
hundred
of
our
men
were
killed
and
wounded
while
the
enemy
it
is
believed
lost
over
two
thousand
it
is
said
by
those
who
were
present
at
the
engagement
that
the
officers
of
the
bengal
infantry
were
heard
to
say
that
if
their
men
had
not
given
way
there
would
have
been
no
disaster
at
all
and
general
mcneill
instead
of
being
accused
of
permitting
himself
to
be
surprised
would
have
got
credit
for
a
heroic
defence
against
overwhelming
odds
if
he
had
carried
out
his
instructions
and
pressed
on
to
the
end
of
eight
miles
instead
of
prudently
halting
when
he
did
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
force
would
have
been
surprised
and
absolutely
cut
to
pieces
chapter
nineteen
refers
to
sergeant
hardy
sutherland
and
other
matters
among
the
wounded
in
the
great
fight
which
we
have
just
described
was
hardy
the
sergeant
his
position
at
the
time
the
arabs
broke
into
the
square
was
close
to
the
right
flank
of
the
indian
native
regiment
which
gave
way
so
that
it
was
he
and
a
number
of
the
flank
men
of
his
company
who
had
to
do
most
of
the
fighting
necessary
to
repair
the
disaster
and
drive
back
the
enemy
of
course
every
soldier
engaged
in
that
part
of
the
fight
was
for
a
time
almost
overwhelmed
in
the
confusion
and
many
of
them
were
surrounded
and
severely
wounded
when
the
native
infantry
broke
hardy
captain
sprang
to
the
front
sword
in
hand
and
cut
down
two
of
the
foe
as
he
did
so
he
was
for
a
moment
separated
from
his
company
and
surrounded
a
powerful
arab
was
on
the
point
of
thrusting
his
spear
into
the
captain
back
when
hardy
observed
his
danger
bayoneted
the
arab
and
saved
the
officer
but
it
was
almost
at
the
cost
of
his
own
life
for
another
arab
with
whom
he
had
been
fighting
at
the
moment
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
thrust
his
spear
into
the
chest
of
the
sergeant
who
fell
as
was
thought
mortally
wounded
this
however
was
not
the
case
for
when
the
fight
was
over
his
wound
although
dangerous
was
not
supposed
to
be
fatal
and
he
went
into
hospital
on
returning
to
suakim
he
was
a
blue
light
and
his
temperance
habits
told
in
his
favour
so
did
his
religion
for
the
calm
equanimity
with
which
he
submitted
to
the
will
of
god
and
bore
his
sufferings
went
far
to
assist
the
doctor
in
grappling
with
his
wound
but
his
religion
did
more
than
that
for
when
he
thought
of
the
heaven
that
awaited
him
if
he
should
die
and
of
being
for
ever
with
the
lord
his
heart
was
filled
with
joy
and
joy
not
only
does
not
kill
it
is
absolutely
a
source
of
life
in
the
sergeant
case
it
formed
an
important
factor
in
restoring
him
to
partial
health
one
evening
some
time
after
the
battle
of
mcneill
zereba
sutherland
and
gaspard
redgrave
were
seated
beside
the
sergeant
bed
cheering
him
up
a
bit
as
they
said
and
chatting
about
the
details
of
the
recent
fight
once
or
twice
the
sergeant
had
tried
to
lead
the
conversation
to
religious
subjects
but
without
success
for
neither
sutherland
nor
gaspard
were
seriously
disposed
and
both
fought
shy
of
such
matters
well
it
very
kind
of
you
to
come
an
cheer
me
up
lads
said
hardy
at
last
and
i
hope
i
may
live
to
do
the
same
for
you
if
either
of
you
ever
gets
knocked
over
now
i
want
each
of
you
to
do
me
a
favour
will
you
promise
of
course
we
will
said
gaspard
quickly
if
we
can
said
the
more
cautious
scot
well
then
gaspard
will
you
sing
me
a
song
i
think
it
would
do
me
good
with
the
greatest
pleasure
answered
the
soldier
but
he
added
looking
round
doubtfully
i
do
know
how
they
might
like
it
here
they
not
object
besides
you
can
sing
low
you
got
the
knack
of
singin
soft
better
than
any
man
i
ever
heard
well
what
shall
it
be
returned
the
gratified
gaspard
one
of
sankey
hymns
said
the
sergeant
with
the
remotest
semblance
of
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
as
he
took
a
small
from
under
his
pillow
and
gave
it
to
his
friend
gaspard
did
not
seem
to
relish
the
idea
of
singing
hymns
but
he
had
often
heard
the
blue
lights
sing
them
and
could
not
plead
ignorance
of
the
tunes
besides
being
a
man
of
his
word
he
would
not
refuse
to
fulfil
his
promise
sing
number
we
gather
at
the
river
i
very
fond
of
that
hymn
in
a
sweet
soft
mellow
voice
that
charmed
all
who
were
within
hearing
gaspard
began
the
hymn
and
when
he
had
finished
there
was
heard
more
than
one
amen
and
thank
god
from
the
neighbouring
beds
yes
comrades
we
shall
gather
there
said
the
sergeant
after
a
brief
pause
for
the
same
almighty
saviour
who
saved
died
for
as
well
i
ai
used
to
wettin
my
cheeks
as
know
lads
but
i
my
wound
has
weakened
me
a
bit
now
sutherland
the
favour
i
have
to
ask
of
if
ye
thinkin
o
askin
me
to
pray
broke
in
the
alarmed
scotsman
ye
may
save
your
breath
when
i
promised
i
said
i
noo
i
can
pray
an
it
nae
use
askin
me
to
try
whatever
i
may
come
to
in
this
warld
i
no
be
a
heepycrit
for
ony
leevin
man
quite
right
sutherland
quite
right
i
had
no
intention
of
asking
you
to
pray
replied
hardy
with
a
faint
smile
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
draw
out
my
will
for
me
oh
i
quite
willin
to
do
that
returned
the
relieved
scot
you
see
continued
the
sergeant
one
never
knows
what
may
be
the
result
of
a
bad
wound
in
a
climate
like
this
and
if
it
pleases
my
father
in
heaven
to
call
me
home
i
should
like
the
few
trifles
i
possess
to
go
in
the
right
direction
that
a
sentiment
returned
his
friend
with
an
approving
nod
and
thoughtful
frown
now
as
you
write
a
capital
hand
and
know
how
to
express
yourself
on
paper
continued
hardy
it
strikes
me
that
you
will
do
the
job
better
than
any
one
else
and
being
a
friend
i
feel
that
i
can
talk
freely
to
you
on
my
private
affairs
so
you
help
me
i
wullin
to
try
serjint
and
ac
the
legal
adviser
ye
ken
thank
you
can
you
come
morning
no
serjint
i
canna
because
i
to
start
airly
the
morn
wi
a
pairty
to
meet
the
scots
gairds
comin
back
frae
tamai
but
the
moment
i
come
back
i
come
to
ye
that
will
do
thank
you
and
now
gaspard
what
the
news
from
england
i
hear
that
a
mail
has
just
come
in
news
that
will
make
your
blood
boil
said
gaspard
sternly
it
would
take
a
good
deal
of
powerful
news
to
boil
the
little
blood
that
is
left
in
me
said
hardy
languidly
well
i
do
know
anyhow
it
makes
mine
boil
what
think
of
mcneill
brave
defence
being
represented
in
the
papers
as
a
disaster
you
do
mean
that
indeed
i
do
they
say
that
it
was
a
disaster
whereas
it
was
a
splendid
defence
under
singularly
adverse
circumstances
they
say
that
general
mcneill
permitted
himself
to
be
surprised
if
he
had
tried
to
carry
out
his
instructions
to
the
full
extent
it
would
indeed
have
been
such
a
surprise
that
the
surprising
thing
would
have
been
if
a
single
man
of
us
had
returned
alive
to
tell
the
tale
as
you
and
i
know
full
well
the
truth
is
it
was
the
fault
of
the
intelligence
department
that
nearly
wrecked
us
and
it
was
mcneill
prudence
and
our
pluck
that
saved
us
and
yet
these
at
home
bah
the
soldier
rose
in
hot
indignation
and
strode
from
the
room
he
a
wee
thing
roosed
remarked
sutherland
with
a
yet
slightly
cynical
grin
but
to
ye
ma
man
keep
up
hert
i
come
an
draft
yer
wull
i
the
mornin
so
saying
the
amytoor
lawyer
took
his
departure
and
was
soon
tramping
over
the
desert
sands
with
a
band
of
his
comrades
they
were
not
however
permitted
to
tramp
in
peace
for
their
indefatigable
foe
hung
on
their
skirts
and
annoyed
them
the
greater
part
of
the
way
toward
evening
they
met
the
guards
and
as
it
was
too
late
to
return
to
suakim
the
force
bivouacked
in
mcneill
deserted
zereba
surrounded
by
graves
and
scarcely
buried
corpses
only
those
who
were
there
can
fully
understand
what
that
meant
all
round
the
zereba
and
for
three
miles
on
the
suakim
side
of
it
the
ground
was
strewn
thickly
with
the
graves
of
europeans
indians
and
arabs
and
so
shallow
were
these
that
from
each
of
them
there
oozed
a
dark
dreadful
stain
to
add
to
the
horrors
of
the
scene
portions
of
mangled
and
putrefying
corpses
protruded
from
many
of
them
ghastly
skulls
from
the
sockets
of
which
the
eyes
had
been
picked
by
vultures
and
other
obscene
birds
limbs
of
brave
men
upon
which
the
hyena
had
already
begun
his
dreadful
work
and
hands
with
fingers
spread
and
bent
as
if
still
clutching
the
foe
in
protruded
above
the
surface
mixed
with
these
and
unburied
were
the
putrefying
carcases
of
camels
and
mules
the
whole
filling
the
air
with
a
horrible
stench
and
the
soul
with
a
fearful
loathing
which
ordinary
language
is
powerless
to
describe
and
the
inexperienced
imagination
can
not
conceive
oh
it
is
terrible
to
think
that
from
the
fall
till
now
man
has
gone
on
continually
producing
and
reproducing
scenes
like
this
sometimes
no
doubt
unavoidably
but
often
too
often
because
of
some
trifling
error
or
insult
on
the
part
of
statesmen
or
some
paltry
dispute
about
a
boundary
or
not
infrequently
on
grounds
so
shadowy
and
complex
that
succeeding
historians
have
found
it
almost
impossible
to
convey
the
meaning
thereof
to
the
intellects
of
average
men
amid
these
dreadful
memorials
of
the
recent
fight
the
party
bivouacked
next
day
the
troops
returned
to
suakim
and
sutherland
after
breakfast
and
what
he
called
a
went
to
see
his
friend
sergeant
hardy
with
pen
ink
and
paper
weel
serjint
hoo
are
ye
the
day
pretty
well
thank
you
pretty
well
ah
sutherland
i
have
been
thinking
what
an
important
thing
it
is
for
men
to
come
to
jesus
for
salvation
while
in
their
health
and
strength
for
now
instead
of
being
anxious
about
my
soul
as
so
many
are
when
the
end
approaches
i
am
rejoicing
in
the
thought
of
soon
meeting
god
my
father
sutherland
my
good
fellow
it
is
foolish
as
well
as
wrong
to
think
only
of
this
life
of
all
men
in
the
world
we
soldiers
ought
to
know
this
the
sergeant
spoke
so
earnestly
and
his
eyes
withal
looked
so
solemnly
from
their
sunken
sockets
that
his
friend
could
not
help
being
impressed
i
believe
ye
no
far
wrang
serjint
an
i
tak
shame
to
mysel
that
i
been
sic
a
sinner
up
to
this
time
sutherland
said
this
with
a
look
so
honest
that
hardy
was
moved
to
put
out
his
large
wasted
hand
and
grasp
that
of
his
friend
comrade
he
said
god
is
waiting
to
be
gracious
jesus
is
ever
ready
and
willing
to
save
sutherland
returned
the
pressure
but
made
no
reply
and
hardy
praying
for
a
blessing
on
the
little
that
had
been
said
changed
the
subject
by
saying
you
have
brought
paper
and
ink
i
see
ay
but
man
ye
mauna
be
speakin
o
takin
yer
depairture
yet
this
draftin
o
yer
wull
is
only
a
precaution
quite
right
lad
i
mean
it
only
as
a
precaution
returned
hardy
in
a
cheerful
tone
but
you
seem
to
have
caught
a
cold
eh
what
makes
you
cough
and
clear
your
throat
so
a
cauld
i
wush
it
was
only
a
cauld
man
it
the
stink
o
thae
corps
that
i
canna
get
oot
o
my
nose
an
thrapple
hereupon
sutherland
by
way
of
entertaining
his
invalid
friend
launched
out
into
a
graphic
account
of
the
scene
he
had
so
recently
witnessed
at
mcneill
zereba
when
that
subject
was
exhausted
he
arranged
his
writing
materials
and
began
with
all
the
solemnity
of
a
lawyer
noo
serjeant
what
div
ye
want
me
to
pit
doon
well
i
must
explain
first
that
i
have
very
little
to
leave
and
no
one
to
leave
it
to
what
nae
frien
ava
not
one
i
have
neither
wife
nor
child
brother
nor
sister
i
have
indeed
one
old
cousin
but
he
is
rich
and
would
not
be
benefited
by
my
poor
little
possessions
besides
he
a
old
fellow
and
does
not
deserve
anything
even
though
i
had
something
worth
leaving
however
i
bear
him
no
poor
man
only
i
do
want
what
i
do
leave
to
go
to
him
which
it
would
if
i
were
to
die
without
a
will
because
of
course
he
is
my
natural
heir
and
haud
ye
there
man
said
the
scot
abruptly
but
slowly
if
he
your
heir
ye
heir
tae
ye
ken
of
course
i
am
aware
of
that
returned
the
sergeant
with
an
amused
look
but
the
old
man
is
eccentric
and
has
always
boasted
that
he
means
to
leave
his
wealth
to
some
charity
indeed
i
know
that
he
has
already
made
his
will
leaving
his
money
to
build
an
hospital
for
incurables
of
some
sort
i
believe
ma
certy
if
i
was
his
lawyer
said
sutherland
with
ineffable
scorn
i
wad
advise
him
to
erec
an
hospital
in
his
lifetime
for
incurable
eediots
an
to
gang
in
himsel
as
the
first
patient
but
come
awa
yer
wull
serjint
get
ready
then
my
lawyer
and
see
that
you
put
it
down
all
as
poor
molloy
would
have
said
oh
ye
needna
fear
said
the
scot
i
no
sic
an
ass
as
to
trust
to
my
ain
legal
knowledge
but
jist
you
say
what
ye
want
an
i
pit
it
doon
and
then
write
it
into
a
form
in
the
way
after
mentioning
a
few
trifling
legacies
to
various
comrades
hardy
said
that
he
had
managed
to
save
a
hundred
pounds
during
his
career
which
he
wished
to
divide
between
his
two
comrades
john
miles
and
willie
armstrong
for
whom
he
expressed
strong
regard
sutherland
instead
of
noting
this
down
looked
at
his
friend
in
sad
surprise
thinking
that
weakness
had
caused
his
mind
to
wander
ye
forget
serjint
he
said
softly
that
miles
an
airmstrang
are
baith
deed
no
lad
no
one
can
say
they
are
certainly
dead
aweel
we
canna
exactly
say
it
but
when
ye
consider
o
the
born
deevils
that
have
gotten
haud
o
them
we
are
entitled
to
them
deed
ony
way
they
are
reported
as
that
is
all
and
that
is
enough
for
me
you
write
down
what
i
tell
you
lad
now
have
you
got
it
down
ay
fifty
to
each
there
may
be
some
interest
due
on
the
account
said
the
sergeant
thoughtfully
besides
there
may
be
a
few
things
in
my
kit
that
i
have
forgotten
and
it
not
worth
while
dividing
such
trifles
between
them
weel
weel
ye
only
to
mak
yin
o
them
yer
residooary
legitee
that
pit
it
a
richt
true
my
lawyer
let
it
be
so
said
hardy
with
a
short
laugh
at
the
thought
of
making
so
much
ado
about
nothing
make
miles
my
residuary
legatee
and
now
be
off
draw
it
out
fair
an
leave
me
to
rest
for
i
a
trifle
tired
after
all
this
legal
work
the
will
thus
carefully
considered
was
duly
made
out
signed
and
witnessed
after
which
sergeant
hardy
awaited
with
cheerful
resignation
whatever
fate
should
be
appointed
to
him
his
strong
frame
and
constitution
undamaged
by
youthful
excess
fought
a
vigorous
battle
for
life
and
he
began
slowly
to
mend
but
the
climate
of
suakim
was
so
bad
for
him
that
he
was
finally
sent
down
to
the
hospital
at
alexandria
where
under
much
more
favourable
circumstances
he
began
to
recover
rapidly
one
of
the
nurses
there
was
very
kind
to
him
finding
that
the
sergeant
was
an
earnest
christian
she
had
many
interesting
talks
with
him
on
the
subject
nearest
his
heart
one
day
she
said
to
him
with
unusual
animation
the
doctor
says
you
may
go
down
to
the
soldiers
institute
that
has
recently
been
set
up
here
and
stay
for
some
time
to
recruit
it
is
not
intended
for
invalids
you
know
but
the
ladies
in
charge
are
intimate
friends
of
mine
and
have
agreed
to
let
you
have
a
room
the
institute
stands
on
a
very
pleasant
part
of
the
shore
exposed
to
the
fresh
and
there
are
lots
of
books
and
newspapers
and
games
as
well
as
lectures
concerts
and
ay
just
like
miss
robinson
institute
at
portsmouth
interrupted
hardy
i
know
the
sort
o
thing
well
the
alexandrian
soldiers
institute
is
miss
robinson
returned
the
nurse
with
a
pleased
look
so
if
you
know
the
one
at
portsmouth
there
is
no
need
for
my
describing
the
other
to
you
the
change
will
do
you
more
good
in
a
week
than
months
at
this
place
and
i
come
to
see
you
frequently
there
is
a
widow
lady
staying
there
just
now
to
whom
i
will
introduce
you
she
has
been
helping
us
to
nurse
here
for
she
has
great
regard
for
soldiers
but
her
health
having
somewhat
she
has
transferred
her
services
to
the
institute
for
a
time
she
is
the
widow
of
a
clergyman
who
came
out
here
not
long
ago
and
died
suddenly
you
will
find
her
a
very
sympathetic
soul
chapter
twenty
old
friends
in
new
aspects
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
after
the
conversation
narrated
in
the
last
chapter
sergeant
hardy
sat
in
an
on
the
verandah
of
the
soldiers
institute
at
alexandria
in
the
enjoyment
of
a
refreshing
breeze
which
after
ruffling
the
blue
waters
of
the
mediterranean
came
like
a
cool
hand
on
a
hot
brow
to
bless
for
a
short
time
the
land
of
egypt
like
one
of
aladdin
palaces
the
institute
had
sprung
up
not
exactly
in
a
night
but
in
a
marvellously
short
space
of
time
there
was
more
of
interest
about
it
too
than
about
the
aladdin
buildings
for
whereas
the
latter
were
evolved
magically
out
of
that
mysterious
and
undefinable
region
termed
nowhere
the
miss
robinson
edifice
came
direct
from
smoky
romantic
london
without
the
advantage
of
supernatural
assistance
when
miss
robinson
soldier
friends
were
leaving
for
the
seat
of
war
in
egypt
some
of
them
had
said
to
her
three
thousand
miles
from
home
are
three
thousand
good
reasons
why
you
should
think
of
us
the
friend
took
these
words
to
heart
also
to
god
she
did
think
of
them
and
she
persuaded
other
friends
to
think
of
them
to
such
good
purpose
that
she
soon
found
herself
in
possession
of
funds
sufficient
to
begin
the
work
as
we
have
seen
her
energetic
servant
and
mr
thomas
tufnell
was
sent
out
to
egypt
to
select
a
site
for
the
building
the
old
iron
and
wood
oratory
at
brompton
was
bought
and
sent
out
at
government
expense
a
fact
which
speaks
volumes
for
the
government
opinion
of
the
value
of
miss
robinson
work
among
soldiers
in
putting
up
the
old
oratory
tufnell
had
transformed
it
to
an
extent
that
might
almost
have
made
aladdin
slave
of
the
lamp
jealous
certainly
those
who
were
wont
to
orate
in
the
building
when
it
stood
in
brompton
would
have
failed
to
recognise
the
edifice
as
it
arose
in
egypt
on
the
boulevard
ramleh
between
the
grand
square
of
alexandria
and
the
sea
the
nave
of
the
old
oratory
had
been
converted
into
a
room
feet
long
with
couches
and
tables
running
down
both
sides
a
in
the
centre
writing
materials
in
abundance
and
pictures
on
the
walls
at
one
end
of
the
room
stood
a
pianoforte
couches
and
and
a
door
opened
into
a
garden
facing
the
sea
over
the
door
were
arranged
several
flags
and
above
these
in
large
letters
the
appropriate
words
in
the
name
of
the
lord
will
we
set
up
our
banners
at
the
other
end
was
a
temperance
refreshment
bar
on
a
verandah
facing
the
sea
men
could
repose
on
and
smoke
their
pipes
or
cigars
while
contemplating
the
peculiarities
of
an
eastern
climate
it
was
here
that
our
friend
sergeant
hardy
was
enjoying
that
blessed
state
of
convalescence
which
may
be
described
as
gazing
straight
forward
and
thinking
of
nothing
of
course
there
were
all
the
other
appliances
of
a
institute
such
as
manager
room
room
lavatory
and
all
the
rest
of
it
while
a
handsome
new
stone
building
close
beside
it
contained
for
officers
kitchens
and
by
no
means
least
though
last
a
large
but
to
these
and
many
other
things
we
must
not
devote
too
much
space
for
old
friends
in
new
aspects
claim
our
attention
only
in
passing
from
such
details
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
to
say
that
it
has
been
remarked
that
the
sight
of
miss
robinson
buildings
steadily
rising
from
the
midst
of
acres
of
ruins
while
men
minds
were
agitated
by
the
bombardment
and
its
results
produced
a
sense
of
security
which
had
a
most
beneficial
and
quietening
effect
on
the
town
indeed
one
officer
of
high
rank
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
institute
scheme
had
given
the
inhabitants
more
confidence
in
the
intentions
of
england
than
anything
yet
done
or
promised
by
government
in
a
beside
the
sergeant
reclined
a
shadow
in
loose
remarkably
loose
fitting
soldier
costume
what
a
blessed
place
to
sit
in
and
rest
after
the
toils
and
sufferings
of
war
said
hardy
to
the
shadow
and
how
thankful
i
am
to
god
for
bringing
me
here
it
a
hivenly
place
intirely
responded
the
shadow
an
is
mesilf
as
is
thankful
too
what
left
o
me
anyhow
an
that
not
much
sure
i
had
some
quare
thoughts
in
me
mind
since
i
come
here
wan
o
them
was
what
is
the
smallest
amount
o
skin
an
bone
that
capable
of
howldin
a
thankful
spirit
i
never
studied
algebra
flynn
so
it
of
no
use
puttin
the
question
to
me
said
hardy
besides
i
not
well
enough
yet
to
tackle
difficult
questions
but
i
real
glad
to
see
you
my
boy
though
there
so
little
of
you
to
see
that
it
sarjint
that
just
where
it
lies
returned
flynn
in
a
slow
weak
voice
i
bin
occupied
wi
that
question
too
namely
how
thin
may
a
man
git
widout
losin
the
power
to
howld
up
his
you
need
be
uneasy
on
that
score
said
hardy
casting
an
amused
glance
at
his
companion
for
there
plenty
o
flesh
left
yet
to
keep
ye
goin
till
you
get
to
old
ireland
it
rejoices
my
heart
to
see
you
beside
me
thin
though
you
are
for
the
report
up
country
was
that
you
had
died
on
the
way
to
suez
bad
luck
to
their
reports
that
always
the
way
of
it
i
do
think
the
best
way
to
take
reports
is
to
belaive
the
exact
opposite
o
towld
ye
an
so
ye
come
nearest
the
truth
it
thrue
i
had
a
close
shave
wan
day
i
felt
a
sort
o
as
if
i
was
a
kind
livin
balloon
and
was
floatin
away
whin
the
doctor
came
an
looked
at
me
gone
says
he
a
lie
says
i
with
more
truth
than
purliteness
maybe
an
would
ye
belave
it
i
began
to
mind
from
that
hour
it
was
the
doctor
saved
me
widout
intindin
to
good
luck
to
him
anyhow
he
me
from
slippin
my
cable
that
time
but
it
was
the
good
nursin
as
brought
me
back
my
blissin
on
the
dear
ladies
as
give
their
hearts
to
this
work
all
for
love
by
the
way
continued
flynn
coughing
and
looking
very
stern
for
he
was
ashamed
of
a
tear
or
two
which
rise
and
almost
overflow
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
restrain
them
but
then
you
see
he
was
very
weak
by
the
way
he
said
you
niver
guess
who
wan
o
the
nurses
is
who
think
guess
i
never
guess
right
flynn
try
well
little
mrs
armstrong
nonsense
man
why
she
nursin
her
old
father
in
england
i
miss
robinson
then
h
you
might
as
well
say
the
prime
minister
how
the
portsmuth
institute
could
git
along
widout
no
it
our
friend
mrs
drew
what
the
wife
o
the
reverend
gentleman
as
came
out
with
us
in
the
that
same
though
she
no
longer
the
wife
of
the
riverend
gintleman
for
he
dead
good
man
said
flynn
in
a
sad
voice
i
grieved
to
hear
that
for
he
a
good
man
and
the
pretty
daughter
what
of
her
that
more
nor
i
can
tell
ye
boy
sometimes
her
mother
brings
her
to
the
hospital
to
let
her
see
how
they
manage
but
i
fancy
she
thinks
her
too
young
yet
to
go
in
for
sitch
work
by
hersilf
anyhow
i
seen
her
only
now
an
then
but
the
poor
widdy
comes
though
i
do
belave
she
does
it
widout
pay
the
husband
died
of
a
flyer
caught
in
the
hospital
a
good
while
since
they
say
that
lots
o
young
fellows
are
afther
the
daughter
for
though
the
drews
are
as
poor
as
church
rats
she
got
such
a
swate
purty
face
and
such
innocent
ways
wid
her
that
i
try
for
her
mesilf
av
it
was
that
i
swore
niver
to
forsake
me
owld
grandmother
chatting
thus
about
times
past
and
present
while
they
watched
the
soldiers
and
seamen
who
passed
continuously
in
and
out
of
the
institute
intent
on
a
game
or
some
refreshment
or
a
lounge
a
look
at
the
papers
a
confab
with
a
comrade
or
a
bit
of
reading
the
two
invalids
enjoyed
their
rest
to
the
full
and
frequently
blessed
the
lady
who
provided
such
a
retreat
as
well
as
her
assistants
who
for
the
love
of
christ
and
human
souls
had
devoted
themselves
to
carry
on
the
work
in
that
land
i
often
think
said
hardy
but
what
he
thought
was
never
revealed
for
at
that
moment
two
ladies
in
deep
mourning
approached
whom
the
sergeant
recognised
at
a
glance
as
mrs
drew
and
her
daughter
marion
the
faces
of
both
were
pale
and
sorrowful
but
the
beauty
of
the
younger
was
rather
enhanced
than
otherwise
by
this
and
by
contrast
with
her
sombre
garments
they
both
recognised
the
sergeant
at
once
and
hastening
forward
so
as
to
prevent
his
rising
greeted
him
with
the
kindly
warmth
of
old
friends
it
seems
such
a
long
time
since
we
met
said
the
elder
lady
but
we
have
never
forgotten
you
or
the
comrades
with
whom
we
used
to
have
such
pleasant
talks
in
the
sure
am
i
madam
said
the
sergeant
that
they
have
never
forgotten
and
your
kind
kind
yes
my
husband
was
kind
to
you
all
said
the
widow
observing
the
delicacy
of
feeling
which
stopped
the
soldier
utterance
he
was
kind
to
every
one
but
we
have
heard
some
rumours
that
have
made
me
and
my
daughter
very
sad
is
it
true
that
a
great
many
men
of
your
regiment
were
killed
and
wounded
at
the
battle
fought
by
general
mcneill
quite
true
madam
answered
the
sergeant
glancing
at
the
daughter
with
some
surprise
for
marion
was
gazing
at
him
with
an
intensely
anxious
look
and
parted
lips
but
thank
god
many
were
spared
and
and
how
are
the
two
young
men
that
were
so
fond
of
each
other
like
twins
almost
sure
did
i
tell
ye
misthress
that
they
was
both
ki
hold
your
tongue
flynn
interrupted
the
widow
with
a
forced
smile
you
are
one
of
my
most
talkative
patients
i
want
to
hear
the
truth
of
this
matter
from
a
man
who
has
come
more
recently
from
the
scene
of
action
than
yourself
what
do
you
think
mr
hardy
you
refer
to
john
miles
and
william
armstrong
no
doubt
madam
said
the
sergeant
in
a
somewhat
encouraging
tone
well
if
flynn
says
they
were
killed
he
has
no
ground
whatever
for
saying
so
they
are
only
reported
missing
of
course
that
is
bad
enough
but
as
long
as
a
man
is
only
missing
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
hope
you
see
they
may
have
managed
to
hide
or
been
carried
off
as
prisoners
into
the
interior
and
you
may
be
sure
the
arabs
would
not
be
such
fools
as
to
kill
two
men
like
miles
and
armstrong
they
rather
make
slaves
of
in
which
case
there
will
be
a
chance
of
their
escaping
or
if
we
should
become
friendly
again
wi
these
fellows
they
be
set
free
i
so
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
and
i
felt
sure
that
my
desponding
patient
here
was
taking
too
gloomy
a
view
of
the
matter
said
mrs
drew
with
a
significant
glance
at
marion
who
seemed
to
breathe
more
freely
and
to
lose
some
of
her
anxious
expression
after
the
remarks
perhaps
at
this
point
a
little
conversation
that
took
place
between
mrs
drew
and
her
daughter
that
same
evening
may
not
be
out
of
place
dear
may
said
the
former
did
i
not
tell
you
that
flynn
took
too
gloomy
a
view
of
the
case
of
these
young
soldiers
in
whom
your
dear
father
was
so
much
interested
but
darling
is
it
not
foolish
in
you
to
think
so
much
about
miles
it
may
be
foolish
mother
but
i
can
not
help
it
said
marion
blushing
deeply
for
she
was
very
modest
as
well
as
simple
may
dear
i
wonder
that
you
can
make
such
an
admission
said
the
mother
remonstratively
is
it
wrong
to
make
such
an
admission
to
one
own
mother
when
it
is
true
asked
marion
still
blushing
but
looking
straight
in
her
mother
eyes
for
she
was
very
straightforward
as
well
as
modest
and
simple
of
course
not
dear
but
but
in
short
miles
is
only
a
a
soldier
you
know
and
a
soldier
interrupted
marion
with
a
flash
from
her
soft
brown
eyes
for
she
was
an
enthusiast
as
well
as
straightforward
modest
and
simple
i
suppose
you
mean
that
he
is
only
a
private
but
what
then
may
not
the
poorest
private
in
the
army
rise
if
he
be
but
and
worthy
and
capable
to
the
rank
of
a
general
or
higher
if
there
is
anything
higher
possibly
the
may
be
open
to
him
true
my
love
but
in
the
meantime
his
social
position
is
is
quite
as
good
as
our
own
interrupted
marion
for
she
was
a
desperate
little
radical
as
well
as
an
enthusiast
straightforward
modest
and
simple
you
know
he
let
out
something
about
his
parents
and
position
and
he
told
the
truth
besides
i
repeat
that
i
can
not
loving
him
and
surely
we
are
not
responsible
for
our
affections
we
can
not
love
and
hate
to
order
i
might
fall
in
love
with
with
well
it
no
good
talking
but
anyhow
i
could
not
help
it
i
could
be
silent
if
you
like
but
i
could
not
help
myself
mrs
drew
seemed
a
little
puzzled
how
to
deal
with
her
impetuous
daughter
and
had
begun
to
reply
when
may
interrupted
her
flushing
deeply
for
she
was
very
sensitive
and
with
a
feeling
that
amounted
almost
to
indignation
she
continued
i
wonder
at
you
mother
it
so
unlike
you
as
if
those
unworthy
considerations
of
difference
of
rank
and
station
could
influence
or
ought
to
influence
one
in
such
a
question
as
this
mrs
drew
paused
for
a
moment
she
knew
that
her
daughter
gave
expression
to
the
views
that
had
marked
the
dealings
of
the
husband
and
father
so
lately
lost
to
them
in
every
action
of
his
life
happiness
too
during
the
remainder
of
her
days
might
be
involved
in
the
result
of
the
present
conversation
and
she
was
moved
to
say
my
dear
has
john
miles
ever
spoken
to
you
oh
mother
how
can
you
ask
me
if
he
had
done
so
would
i
have
delayed
one
minute
in
letting
you
know
forgive
me
dearest
i
did
you
wrong
in
admitting
the
thought
even
for
a
moment
but
you
spoke
so
earnestly
as
if
you
might
have
some
reason
for
thinking
that
he
cared
for
you
do
you
know
answered
marion
looking
down
and
a
little
confused
that
men
can
speak
with
their
eyes
as
well
as
their
lips
i
not
only
feel
sure
that
he
cares
for
me
but
i
feel
sure
from
the
sentiments
he
expressed
to
me
on
the
voyage
that
would
induce
him
to
talk
to
me
of
love
while
in
his
present
position
how
does
all
this
consist
my
love
asked
mrs
drew
with
your
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
he
left
home
in
anger
and
would
not
be
persuaded
even
by
your
dear
father
to
write
home
a
penitent
letter
marion
was
silent
this
had
not
occurred
to
her
before
but
love
is
not
to
be
turned
from
its
object
by
trifles
she
was
all
that
we
have
more
than
once
described
her
to
be
but
she
was
not
a
or
a
philosopher
capable
of
comprehending
and
explaining
occult
mysteries
enough
for
her
if
she
loved
miles
and
miles
loved
her
and
then
even
if
he
did
not
deserve
her
love
she
would
remain
true
secretly
but
unalterably
true
to
him
as
the
needle
is
to
the
pole
has
it
not
occurred
to
you
dear
said
her
mother
pursuing
her
advantage
in
a
meditative
tone
that
if
miles
has
been
so
and
eloquent
with
his
blue
eye
that
your
pretty
brown
ones
may
have
said
something
to
never
exclaimed
the
girl
with
an
indignant
flash
oh
mother
can
you
believe
me
capable
of
of
no
i
never
looked
at
him
except
with
the
air
of
a
perfect
stranger
at
least
of
a
a
but
why
should
i
try
to
deny
what
could
not
possibly
be
true
mrs
drew
felt
that
nothing
was
to
be
gained
from
pursuing
the
subject
or
one
aspect
of
it
further
at
any
rate
she
said
i
am
glad
for
his
own
sake
poor
young
fellow
that
sergeant
hardy
spoke
so
hopefully
and
for
his
comrades
sakes
as
well
said
marion
you
know
mother
that
his
friend
armstrong
is
also
reported
as
missing
and
stevenson
the
marine
as
well
as
that
dear
big
bluff
sailor
jack
molloy
by
the
way
do
you
feel
well
enough
to
go
to
the
lecture
it
is
to
be
a
very
interesting
one
i
am
told
with
illustrations
and
i
do
like
to
go
alone
i
am
going
so
you
may
make
your
mind
easy
said
her
mother
i
would
not
miss
this
lecturer
because
i
am
told
that
he
is
a
remarkably
good
one
and
the
hall
is
likely
to
be
quite
full
in
regard
to
this
lecture
and
some
other
things
connected
with
the
alexandrian
institute
our
friend
sergeant
hardy
learned
a
good
deal
from
the
lady
at
the
head
of
it
not
long
after
the
time
that
mrs
drew
had
the
foregoing
conversation
with
marion
it
is
scarcely
needful
to
say
that
the
was
a
capable
christian
as
well
as
an
enthusiast
in
her
work
come
to
my
room
sergeant
hardy
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
she
said
leading
the
way
to
her
apartment
where
the
sergeant
placed
himself
upon
a
chair
bolt
upright
as
if
he
were
going
to
have
a
tooth
drawn
or
were
about
to
illustrate
some
new
species
of
chapter
twenty
one
shows
how
the
lady
of
the
institute
discourses
to
the
sergeant
how
go
out
on
the
spree
and
how
music
conquers
warriors
it
seems
wonderful
to
me
madam
said
sergeant
hardy
looking
round
the
lady
room
with
an
admiring
gaze
how
quickly
you
have
got
things
into
working
order
here
when
i
remember
that
last
year
this
place
was
a
heap
of
rubbish
it
seems
like
magic
ah
the
work
of
god
on
earth
seems
magical
the
more
we
reflect
on
it
returned
the
lady
the
fact
that
our
institute
was
conceived
planned
and
carried
into
successful
operation
by
an
invalid
lady
in
spite
of
discouragement
and
at
first
with
inadequate
means
is
itself
little
short
of
miraculous
but
what
is
even
more
surprising
is
the
fact
that
the
government
which
began
by
throwing
cold
water
on
her
portsmouth
work
has
ended
by
recognising
it
and
by
affording
us
every
facility
here
in
alexandria
well
you
see
madam
i
suppose
it
because
they
see
that
we
soldiers
and
sailors
likes
it
an
it
does
a
power
o
good
do
you
think
no
doubt
but
whatever
may
be
the
reason
sergeant
we
are
very
thankful
for
the
encouragement
i
suppose
you
have
heard
what
a
grand
occasion
our
opening
day
was
no
madam
i
have
you
see
away
at
suakim
we
was
so
constantly
taken
up
with
the
attentions
of
osman
digna
that
we
had
little
time
for
anything
but
eatin
and
sleepin
when
we
was
on
sentry
an
fightin
so
that
we
often
missed
bits
of
news
was
there
a
great
men
indeed
there
was
returned
the
lady
with
animation
and
not
only
of
men
but
of
all
the
alexandrian
notables
it
was
on
the
of
february
last
that
our
institute
was
opened
by
lennox
who
was
in
command
of
the
garrison
this
was
not
the
first
time
by
any
means
that
the
soldiers
had
paid
us
a
visit
a
number
of
men
who
like
yourself
sergeant
hardy
sympathise
with
our
work
in
its
spiritual
aspects
had
been
frequently
coming
to
see
how
we
were
getting
on
and
many
a
pleasant
hour
prayer
and
singing
we
had
enjoyed
with
them
accompanied
by
our
little
harmonium
which
had
been
sent
to
us
by
kind
friends
in
england
and
every
sunday
evening
we
had
had
a
little
service
in
the
midst
of
the
shavings
and
benches
but
on
this
grand
opening
day
the
men
came
down
in
hundreds
and
a
great
surprise
some
of
them
got
especially
the
sceptical
among
them
the
entrance
was
decorated
with
palms
at
the
further
end
of
the
the
trophy
of
union
jacks
and
the
royal
standard
which
you
see
there
now
was
put
up
by
a
band
of
who
had
come
to
help
us
as
well
as
to
see
the
fun
over
the
trophy
was
our
text
the
name
of
the
lord
will
we
set
up
our
banners
for
we
liked
to
feel
that
we
had
taken
possession
of
this
little
spot
in
egypt
for
god
and
we
believe
that
it
will
always
be
his
everything
was
bright
and
hearty
there
were
about
five
hundred
soldiers
and
sailors
and
between
two
and
three
hundred
officers
and
civilians
of
all
nationalities
on
the
platform
we
had
osman
pasha
ha
interrupted
the
sympathetic
sergeant
i
only
wish
we
could
have
had
osman
digna
there
too
it
would
do
more
to
pacify
the
soudan
than
killing
his
men
does
i
daresay
it
would
responded
the
lady
with
a
laugh
but
have
patience
hardy
we
shall
have
him
there
yet
and
perhaps
the
mahdi
too
or
some
future
grand
occasion
well
as
i
was
saying
we
had
osman
the
governor
of
alexandria
on
our
platform
and
a
lot
of
that
you
know
nothing
about
but
whose
influence
was
of
importance
and
whose
appearance
went
far
to
make
the
place
look
gay
of
course
we
had
music
beginning
with
save
the
queen
and
speeches
brilliant
as
well
as
heavy
sententious
and
comic
like
all
other
similar
gatherings
and
the
enthusiasm
was
unbounded
how
could
it
be
otherwise
with
sailors
to
cheer
and
soldiers
to
back
them
up
and
you
may
be
sure
that
in
such
a
meeting
the
enthusiasm
about
the
undertaking
did
not
fail
to
extend
to
the
friend
who
had
originated
the
whole
in
short
it
was
a
splendid
success
of
course
it
was
said
the
sergeant
with
emphasis
first
because
of
god
blessing
an
second
because
the
institoot
was
greatly
needed
why
madam
if
it
was
for
this
place
the
thousands
of
soldiers
stationed
here
not
to
mention
the
sailors
would
have
no
place
to
go
to
spend
their
leave
and
leisure
time
but
the
drinkin
dens
o
the
town
an
know
well
though
not
so
well
as
i
do
what
terrible
places
these
are
where
men
are
tempted
fleeced
debauched
and
sometimes
murdered
quite
true
hardy
did
you
hear
of
the
case
that
occurred
just
two
days
ago
a
sergeant
of
one
of
the
regiments
i
forget
which
after
paying
his
fare
to
a
turned
quietly
to
walk
away
when
the
scoundrel
felled
him
with
a
stick
and
robbed
him
of
one
pound
shillings
the
case
is
before
the
now
and
no
doubt
the
robber
will
receive
a
just
reward
well
as
i
was
remarking
the
opening
day
carried
us
to
high
tide
so
to
speak
and
there
has
been
no
ebb
from
that
day
to
this
one
comical
incident
however
occurred
just
at
the
beginning
which
might
have
done
us
damage
the
day
after
the
opening
all
was
prepared
for
the
reception
of
our
soldier
and
sailor
friends
the
tables
were
arranged
with
books
and
games
the
with
pens
ink
and
and
the
bar
with
all
sorts
of
eatables
magnificent
urns
coloured
glass
etcetera
about
one
william
our
barman
tasted
the
coffee
his
usual
expression
of
gave
place
to
one
of
horror
he
tasted
the
coffee
again
the
look
of
horror
deepened
he
ran
to
the
boiler
and
the
mystery
was
cleared
up
the
boiler
had
been
filled
with
our
arab
ibraim
who
carries
up
seawater
daily
to
fill
our
baths
had
filled
the
boiler
with
the
same
luckily
there
was
time
to
correct
the
mistake
and
when
our
friends
came
trooping
in
at
four
they
found
the
coffee
quite
to
their
taste
you
know
very
well
continued
the
superintendent
our
rules
never
to
force
religion
on
any
of
our
customers
our
object
being
to
by
all
the
legitimate
means
in
our
power
we
have
our
temperance
soirees
and
the
like
distinct
as
at
portsmouth
from
the
other
advantages
of
the
institute
and
are
quite
content
if
some
who
come
at
first
from
mere
curiosity
or
for
the
enjoyment
of
temporal
good
things
should
afterwards
continue
to
come
from
higher
and
spiritual
motives
but
if
our
military
friends
prefer
to
read
our
papers
and
books
and
play
our
games
and
use
our
bar
they
are
at
perfect
liberty
to
do
so
without
what
i
may
style
religious
interference
it
all
fair
and
you
see
we
fully
recognise
the
freedom
of
will
that
god
has
bestowed
on
man
if
you
do
care
for
our
spiritual
fare
you
may
let
it
alone
if
you
relish
it
there
it
is
and
you
are
welcome
yet
we
hold
by
our
right
to
win
men
if
we
can
in
point
of
fact
we
have
been
very
successful
already
in
this
way
for
our
motive
power
from
beginning
to
end
is
love
one
of
our
most
helpful
soldier
friends
a
sergeant
has
brought
several
men
to
the
saviour
who
are
now
our
steady
supporters
one
of
these
men
whom
our
sergeant
was
the
means
of
bringing
in
was
a
professed
unbeliever
of
good
standing
and
ability
the
first
time
he
was
prevailed
on
to
come
to
a
he
sat
bolt
upright
while
we
knelt
being
a
straightforward
sort
of
man
who
refused
to
pretend
when
he
could
not
really
pray
he
is
now
a
happy
follower
of
jesus
our
large
rooms
are
constantly
filled
with
soldiers
some
chatting
some
making
up
for
past
privations
by
having
a
good
english
meal
and
others
reading
or
playing
games
just
now
happens
to
be
our
quietest
hour
but
it
wo
be
long
before
we
have
a
bustling
scene
as
if
to
verify
the
lady
words
there
came
through
the
doorways
at
that
moment
a
sound
of
shouting
and
cheering
which
caused
all
the
staff
of
the
institute
to
start
into
active
life
there
they
come
exclaimed
the
lady
with
an
intelligent
smile
as
she
hurried
from
the
room
leaving
hardy
to
follow
at
a
pace
that
was
more
consistent
with
his
dignity
and
we
may
add
his
physical
weakness
the
shouts
proceeded
from
a
party
of
sailors
on
leave
from
one
of
the
ironclads
lying
in
the
harbour
these
being
out
for
the
day
on
a
spree
as
some
of
them
styled
it
had
hired
donkeys
and
come
in
a
body
to
the
institute
where
they
knew
that
food
of
the
best
dressed
in
british
fashion
and
familiar
games
were
to
be
had
along
with
british
cheer
and
sympathy
when
hardy
reached
the
door
he
found
the
place
swarming
with
trooping
up
at
intervals
on
various
animals
but
none
on
foot
save
those
who
had
fallen
off
their
mounts
and
were
trying
to
get
on
again
they
all
donkeyfied
together
remarked
a
sarcastic
old
salt
not
one
of
the
party
who
stood
beside
hardy
looking
complacently
on
and
smoking
his
pipe
they
do
steer
as
well
on
land
as
on
sea
replied
hardy
they
ai
used
to
such
craft
you
see
that
it
is
sarjint
said
the
old
salt
removing
his
pipe
for
a
moment
just
look
at
some
comin
along
sidewise
like
crabs
others
stern
foremost
there
that
grey
craft
wi
the
broad
little
man
holdin
on
to
its
tail
to
prevent
his
slidin
over
its
head
i
watched
that
grey
craft
for
some
minutes
and
its
hind
propellers
have
bin
so
often
in
the
air
that
it
do
seem
as
if
it
was
walkin
upon
its
front
legs
hallo
i
was
sure
he
go
down
by
the
head
at
last
the
donkey
in
question
had
indeed
gone
down
by
the
head
and
rolled
over
pitching
its
rider
on
his
broad
shoulders
which
however
seemed
none
the
worse
for
the
fall
ketch
hold
of
his
tail
bill
cried
another
man
and
hold
his
stern
down
see
if
that
wo
cure
his
plungin
he
like
a
dutchman
in
a
cross
sea
keep
clear
o
this
fellow
heels
jack
he
agoin
to
fire
another
broadside
if
he
does
he
unship
you
cried
jack
who
was
himself
at
the
same
moment
unshipped
while
the
owner
of
the
donkey
and
of
the
other
donkeys
shouted
advice
if
nothing
worse
in
arabic
and
broken
english
in
a
few
minutes
the
sailors
boarded
the
institute
and
drew
the
whole
force
of
the
establishment
to
the
bar
in
order
to
supply
the
demand
ah
thin
ye
got
irish
whisky
have
ye
demanded
a
facetious
seaman
yes
plenty
but
we
call
it
coffee
here
answered
the
equally
facetious
barman
whose
satellites
were
distributing
hot
and
cold
drinks
with
a
degree
of
speed
that
could
only
be
the
fruit
of
much
practice
you
have
to
be
jolly
on
mild
swipes
said
one
no
liquors
allowed
dick
h
growled
dick
got
any
wittles
here
demanded
another
man
wiping
his
lips
with
his
sleeve
yes
plenty
sit
down
and
order
what
you
want
for
nothin
asked
the
tar
for
to
nothing
was
the
prompt
reply
meanwhile
those
whose
appetites
were
not
quite
so
urgent
had
distributed
themselves
about
the
place
and
were
already
busy
with
draughts
billiards
etcetera
while
those
who
were
of
more
sedate
and
inquiring
temperament
were
deep
in
the
columns
of
the
english
papers
and
magazines
i
say
fred
thorley
ai
it
bang
up
remarked
a
sturdy
little
man
through
a
huge
slice
of
cake
with
which
he
had
just
filled
his
mouth
responded
fred
as
he
finished
a
cup
of
coffee
at
a
draught
and
called
for
more
did
i
tell
you
sam
that
you
like
it
better
than
the
native
if
they
got
bitter
beer
sighed
sam

got
better
beer
said
his
friend
try

no
thankee

least

now

bit

here
blue
lights
asked
sam
with
a
somewhat
doleful
visage
by
no
manner
o
means
returned
his
friend
with
a
laugh
tho
for
the
matter
o
that
they
would
be
worse
men
if
they
was
but
many
of
are
no
better
than
they
should
be
an
know
sam
there
are
some
of
actually
as
great
blackguards
as
yourself
there

comfort
in
that
anyhow
returned
sam
with
a
pleasant
smile
for
i
hates
to
be
pecooliar
by
the
way
fred
they
may
be
able
to
give
you
some
noos
here
if
you
ax
about
your
friend
jack
molloy
was
a
blue
light
was
he
not
i
know
but
he
was
a
seaman
an
a
good
friend
though
he
fond
of
his
glass
like
yourself
sam
it
chanced
that
at
this
point
sergeant
hardy
in
moving
about
the
place
taking
profound
interest
in
all
that
he
saw
came
within
earshot
of
the
two
friends
to
whom
he
at
once
went
up
and
introduced
himself
as
a
friend
of
jack
molloy
indeed
said
he
molloy
and
i
fought
pretty
near
to
each
other
in
that
last
affair
under
general
mcneill
so
i
can
give
you
the
latest
news
of
him
can
you
old
man
come
sit
down
here
an
let
have
it
then
said
thorley
jack
was
an
old
messmate
o
mine
what
you
take
to
drink
mate
nothing
thankee
i
allowanced
by
the
doctor
even
in
the
matter
tea
and
coffee
said
the
sergeant
as
to
bein
an
old
man
well
i
ai
much
older
than
yourself
i
daresay
though
wounds
and
sickness
and
physic
are
apt
to
age
a
man
in
looks
sitting
down
beside
the
sailors
hardy
told
of
the
great
fight
at
mcneill
zereba
and
how
molloy
and
others
of
his
friends
had
gone
to
rescue
a
comrade
and
been
cut
off
he
relieved
fred
mind
however
by
taking
the
most
hopeful
view
of
the
matter
as
he
had
previously
relieved
the
feelings
of
marion
and
then
the
three
fell
to
chatting
on
things
in
general
and
the
war
in
particular
now
do
this
feel
homelike
said
sam
looking
round
the
room
with
great
satisfaction
if
it
was
for
the
heat
i
think
we
was
in
a
temperance
in
old
england
or
owld
ireland
chimed
in
a
sailor
at
the
neighbouring
table
to
say
naething
o
auld
scotland
added
a
rugged
man
in
red
hair
who
sat
beside
him
well
messmate
assented
fred
it
feel
homelike
an
no
mistake
why
what
ever
is
the
sailor
paused
and
held
up
a
finger
as
if
to
impose
silence
while
he
listened
but
there
was
no
need
to
enforce
silence
for
at
that
moment
the
sweet
strains
of
a
harmonium
were
heard
at
the
other
end
of
the
long
room
and
quietude
profound
descended
on
the
company
as
a
rich
baritone
voice
sang
with
wonderful
pathos
the
familiar
notes
and
words
of
home
sweet
home
before
that
song
was
finished
many
a
warrior
there
had
to
fight
desperately
with
his
own
spirit
to
conceal
the
fact
that
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
indeed
not
a
few
of
them
refused
to
fight
at
all
but
ingloriously
lowering
their
colours
allowed
the
drops
to
course
over
their
bronzed
faces
as
they
thought
of
sweethearts
and
wives
and
friends
and
home
circles
and
the
light
of
other
days
chapter
twenty
two
led
into
captivity
we
turn
once
more
to
the
nubian
desert
where
it
will
be
remembered
we
left
several
of
our
friends
cut
off
from
mcneill
zereba
at
a
critical
moment
when
they
were
all
but
overwhelmed
by
a
host
of
foes
the
arab
who
had
so
opportunely
appeared
on
the
scene
and
arrested
the
spears
which
were
about
to
finish
the
career
of
jack
molloy
was
no
other
than
the
man
who
had
been
saved
by
miles
from
the
bullet
of
his
comrade
rattling
bill
a
kind
act
had
in
this
case
received
its
appropriate
reward
for
a
brief
though
slight
glance
and
a
gracious
inclination
of
the
arab
head
convinced
our
hero
that
the
whole
party
owed
their
lives
to
this
man
gratitude
they
were
not
however
exempt
from
indignity
for
at
the
moment
when
jack
molloy
fell
they
were
overwhelmed
by
numbers
their
arms
were
wrenched
from
their
grasp
and
their
hands
were
bound
behind
their
backs
thus
they
were
led
the
reverse
of
gently
into
the
thick
bush
by
a
strong
party
of
natives
while
the
others
headed
by
the
chief
continued
their
attack
on
the
zereba
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
men
who
had
charge
of
the
prisoners
did
not
share
or
sympathise
with
the
feelings
of
the
chief
who
had
spared
their
lives
for
they
not
only
forced
them
to
hurry
forward
as
fast
as
they
could
go
but
gave
them
occasional
pricks
with
their
when
any
of
them
chanced
to
trip
or
stumble
one
of
the
warriors
in
particular
a
fiery
man
sometimes
struck
them
with
the
shaft
of
his
spear
and
otherwise
maltreated
them
it
may
be
easily
understood
that
men
with
unbroken
spirits
and
high
courage
did
not
submit
to
this
treatment
with
a
good
grace
miles
was
the
first
to
be
tested
in
this
way
on
reaching
a
piece
of
broken
ground
his
foot
caught
in
something
and
he
stumbled
forward
his
hands
being
bound
behind
him
he
could
not
protect
his
head
and
the
result
was
that
he
plunged
into
a
prickly
shrub
out
of
which
he
arose
with
flushed
and
bleeding
countenance
this
was
bad
enough
but
when
the
fiery
arab
brought
a
lance
down
heavily
on
his
shoulders
his
temper
gave
way
and
he
rushed
at
the
man
in
a
towering
rage
striving
at
the
same
time
with
intense
violence
to
burst
his
bonds
of
course
he
failed
and
was
rewarded
by
a
blow
on
the
head
which
for
a
moment
or
two
stunned
him
seeing
this
armstrong
power
of
restraint
gave
way
and
he
sprang
to
the
rescue
of
his
friend
but
only
to
meet
the
same
fate
at
the
hands
of
the
fiery
arab
stunned
and
bleeding
though
not
subdued
they
were
compelled
to
move
on
again
at
the
head
of
the
party
spurred
on
now
and
then
by
a
touch
from
the
point
of
the
fiery
man
lance
indeed
it
seemed
as
if
this
passionate
nature
would
induce
him
ere
long
to
risk
his
chief
wrath
by
disobeying
orders
and
stabbing
the
prisoners
stevenson
the
marine
was
the
next
to
suffer
for
his
foot
slipped
on
a
stone
and
he
fell
with
such
violence
as
to
be
unable
to
rise
for
a
few
minutes
impatient
of
the
delay
the
fiery
man
struck
him
so
savagely
with
the
that
even
his
own
comrades
remonstrated
if
i
could
only
burst
this
cord
growled
simkin
between
his
teeth
i
he
stopped
for
he
felt
that
it
was
unmanly
as
well
as
idle
to
boast
in
the
circumstances
we
must
have
patience
comrade
said
stevenson
as
he
rose
pale
and
bloodstained
from
the
ground
our
great
captain
sometimes
gives
us
the
order
to
submit
and
suffer
and
a
prick
in
the
fleshy
part
of
his
thigh
caused
him
to
stop
abruptly
at
this
point
the
endurance
of
jack
molloy
failed
him
and
he
also
went
in
for
violent
action
but
jack
was
a
genius
as
well
as
a
sailor
and
profited
by
the
failures
of
his
comrades
instead
of
making
futile
efforts
to
break
his
bonds
like
them
he
lowered
his
hairy
head
and
with
a
howl
and
a
tremendous
rush
like
a
launched
himself
or
as
it
were
took
a
header
into
the
fiery
man
no
fellow
as
jack
himself
afterwards
remarked
could
receive
fifteen
stone
ten
into
his
and
go
on
smiling
on
the
contrary
he
went
down
like
a
and
remained
where
he
fell
for
his
comrades
who
evidently
did
not
love
him
merely
laughed
and
went
on
their
way
leaving
him
to
revive
at
his
leisure
the
prisoners
advanced
somewhat
more
cheerfully
after
this
event
for
besides
being
freed
from
pricks
of
the
there
was
that
feeling
of
elation
which
usually
arises
in
every
mind
from
the
sight
of
demerit
meeting
with
its
appropriate
reward
the
region
over
which
they
were
thus
led
or
driven
was
rather
more
varied
than
the
level
country
behind
them
and
towards
evening
it
changed
still
further
becoming
more
decidedly
at
night
the
party
found
themselves
in
the
neighbourhood
of
one
of
the
wells
of
the
land
beside
which
they
encamped
under
a
small
tree
here
the
prisoners
were
allowed
to
sit
down
on
the
ground
with
one
man
to
guard
them
while
the
others
kindled
a
fire
and
otherwise
arranged
the
encampment
supper
consisting
of
a
small
quantity
of
boiled
corn
and
dried
flesh
was
given
to
the
prisoners
whose
hands
were
set
free
though
their
elbows
were
loosely
lashed
together
and
their
feet
tied
to
prevent
their
escape
no
such
idea
however
entered
into
the
heads
of
any
of
them
for
they
were
by
that
time
in
the
heart
of
an
unknown
range
of
hills
in
a
country
which
swarmed
with
foes
besides
which
they
would
not
have
known
in
what
direction
to
fly
had
they
been
free
to
do
so
they
possessed
neither
arms
ammunition
nor
provisions
and
were
at
the
time
greatly
exhausted
by
their
forced
march
perhaps
jack
molloy
was
the
only
man
of
the
unfortunate
party
who
at
that
moment
retained
either
the
wish
or
the
power
to
make
a
dash
for
freedom
but
then
jack
was
an
eccentric
and
exceptional
man
in
every
respect
nothing
could
quell
his
spirit
and
it
was
all
but
impossible
to
subdue
his
body
he
was
what
we
may
term
a
composite
character
his
frame
was
a
mixture
of
leather
and
brass
his
brain
was
a
compound
of
vivid
fancy
and
slow
perception
his
heart
was
a
union
of
highly
inflammable
oil
and
deeply
impressible
butter
with
something
remarkably
tough
in
the
centre
of
it
had
he
been
a
red
indian
he
would
have
been
a
chief
if
born
a
nigger
he
would
have
been
a
king
in
the
tenth
century
he
might
have
been
a
or
something
similar
born
as
he
was
in
the
nineteenth
century
he
was
only
a
and
a
hero
it
is
safe
to
conclude
that
if
molloy
had
been
set
free
that
evening
with
a
cutlass
in
his
hand
he
would
after
supper
of
course
have
attacked
the
united
band
of
forty
arabs
killed
at
least
ten
of
them
and
left
the
remaining
thirty
to
mourn
over
their
mangled
bodies
and
the
loss
of
numerous
thumbs
and
noses
to
say
nothing
of
other
wounds
and
bruises
luckily
for
his
comrades
he
was
free
that
night
boys
said
he
after
finishing
his
scanty
meal
and
resting
on
an
elbow
as
he
looked
contemplatively
up
at
the
stars
which
were
beginning
to
twinkle
in
the
darkening
sky
it
do
seem
to
me
now
that
i
had
time
to
think
over
it
quietly
that
our
only
chance
o
gittin
out
this
here
scrape
is
to
keep
quiet
an
pretend
that
we
uncommon
fond
of
our
arab
friends
till
we
throws
off
their
guard
then
some
fine
night
give
the
slip
an
make
sail
across
the
desert
for
suakim
no
doubt
you
right
answered
miles
with
a
sigh
for
being
tired
and
sleepy
just
then
he
was
not
nearly
as
sanguine
as
the
seaman
but
i
have
not
much
hope
of
gaining
their
confidence
especially
after
your
acting
the
thunderbolt
so
effectively
on
one
of
them
why
man
alive
they
wo
mind
that
it
was
all
in
the
way
of
fair
fight
said
molloy
an
the
rascal
was
no
favourite
i
could
see
that
it
a
wonder
to
me
you
could
see
anything
at
all
after
such
a
ram
remarked
moses
pyne
with
a
yawn
as
he
lay
back
and
rested
his
head
on
a
tuft
of
grass
the
shock
seemed
to
me
fit
to
sink
an
but
why
to
be
fond
of
the
arabs
asked
stevenson
you
think
it
would
be
sufficient
that
we
should
obey
orders
quietly
without
any
humbug
or
pretence
at
all
about
it
till
a
chance
to
escape
shall
come
in
our
way
do
you
think
stevenson
said
miles
that
there
a
certain
amount
of
humbug
and
pretence
even
in
quiet
obedience
to
orders
when
such
obedience
is
not
the
result
of
submission
but
of
a
desire
to
throw
people
off
their
guard
but
my
obedience
the
result
of
submission
returned
the
marine
stoutly
i
do
really
submit
first
because
it
is
god
will
for
i
can
not
help
it
second
because
it
is
the
only
course
that
will
enable
me
to
escape
bad
treatment
third
because
i
wish
to
gain
the
of
the
men
who
have
me
in
their
power
whether
i
escape
or
not
and
fourth
hallo
old
man
how
many
heads
are
you
goin
to
give
us
in
that
there
sermon
asked
moses
this
is
the
last
head
moses
and
you
need
be
anxious
for
i
going
to
enlarge
on
any
of
my
fourth
reason
is
that
by
doing
as
bids
me
our
foes
will
be
brought
thereby
to
that
state
of
mind
which
will
be
favourable
to
everything
our
escape
included
and
i
ca
help
that
you
know
it
ai
my
fault
if
they
become
trustful
is
it
no
nor
it
ai
no
part
o
your
dooty
to
spoil
their
trustfulness
by
failin
to
take
advantage
of
it
said
molloy
with
a
grin
but
it
do
seem
to
me
stevenson
as
if
there
wor
a
strong
smack
o
the
jesuit
in
what
you
say
i
hope
not
replied
the
marine
anyhow
no
one
would
expect
me
surely
to
go
an
say
straight
out
to
these
fellows
goin
to
obey
orders
an
be
as
meek
as
a
lamb
in
order
to
throw
you
off
your
guard
an
bolt
when
i
get
the
chance
not
why
firstly
you
could
say
it
at
all
till
you
learned
arabic
returned
molloy
secondly
if
i
may
be
allowed
for
to
follow
suit
an
sermonise
you
should
say
it
if
you
could
an
thirdly
you
be
a
most
awful
to
say
it
if
you
did
now
it
my
advice
boys
that
we
go
to
sleep
for
we
have
an
easy
day
of
it
if
i
may
judge
from
having
delivered
this
piece
of
advice
with
much
decision
the
seaman
extended
himself
at
full
length
on
the
ground
and
went
to
sleep
with
a
pleased
smile
on
his
face
as
if
the
desert
sand
had
been
his
familiar
couch
from
infancy
some
of
the
other
members
of
the
unfortunate
party
were
not
however
quite
so
ready
for
sleep
miles
and
his
friend
armstrong
sat
long
talking
over
their
fate
which
they
mutually
agreed
was
a
very
sad
one
but
at
last
overcome
by
exhaustion
if
not
anxiety
they
sank
into
repose
and
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
stillness
of
the
night
was
the
tread
of
the
arab
sentinel
as
he
paced
slowly
to
and
fro
the
country
as
they
advanced
became
more
and
more
rugged
until
they
found
themselves
at
last
in
the
midst
of
a
hill
region
in
the
valleys
of
which
there
grew
a
considerable
amount
of
herbage
and
underwood
the
journey
here
became
very
severe
to
the
captives
for
although
they
did
not
suffer
from
thirst
so
much
as
on
the
plains
the
difficulty
of
ascending
steep
and
rugged
paths
with
their
hands
bound
was
very
great
it
is
true
the
position
of
the
hands
was
changed
for
after
the
second
day
they
had
been
bound
in
front
of
them
but
this
did
not
render
their
toil
easy
though
it
was
thereby
made
a
little
less
laborious
by
this
time
the
captives
had
learned
from
experience
that
if
they
wished
to
avoid
the
they
must
walk
in
advance
of
their
captors
at
a
very
smart
pace
fortunately
being
all
strong
and
healthy
men
they
were
well
able
to
do
so
rattling
bill
perhaps
suffered
most
although
after
molloy
he
was
physically
one
of
the
strongest
of
the
party
observing
that
he
lagged
behind
a
little
on
one
occasion
while
they
were
traversing
a
somewhat
level
valley
stevenson
offered
him
his
arm
do
be
ashamed
to
take
it
old
boy
said
the
marine
kindly
as
his
comrade
hesitated
you
know
a
fellow
sometimes
feels
out
o
sorts
and
not
up
to
much
however
stout
he
may
be
when
well
so
just
you
lay
hold
for
somehow
i
happen
to
feel
as
strong
as
an
elephant
but
i
ill
returned
simkin
still
declining
and
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
as
able
as
you
are
to
carry
my
own
weight
of
course
you
are
better
able
to
do
it
than
i
am
in
a
general
way
returned
his
friend
but
i
said
that
sometimes
you
know
a
fellow
gives
in
he
do
well
know
why
or
how
an
then
of
course
his
comrades
that
are
still
strong
are
bound
to
help
him
here
hook
on
and
pocket
your
pride
you
have
to
do
the
same
thing
for
me
when
give
in
and
if
it
does
come
to
that
i
lean
heavy
i
promise
you
you
a
good
fellow
stevenson
even
though
you
a
blue
light
said
simkin
taking
the
proffered
arm
perhaps
it
i
am
a
blue
light
returned
the
marine
with
a
laugh
at
all
events
it
is
certain
that
whatever
good
there
may
be
about
me
at
all
is
the
result
of
that
light
which
is
as
free
to
you
as
to
me
for
some
minutes
the
couple
walked
along
in
silence
at
last
rattling
bill
spoke
i
wonder
he
said
why
it
is
that
a
young
and
healthy
fellow
like
me
should
break
down
sooner
than
you
stevenson
for
i
both
bigger
and
stronger
and
yet
look
at
us
new
ai
it
strange
i
wonder
why
it
is
it
is
strange
indeed
returned
the
marine
quietly
the
climate
suits
me
better
than
you
i
know
what
you
thinkin
said
simkin
almost
testily
why
you
say
that
is
the
cause
of
it
straight
out
like
a
man
because
i
knew
you
were
saying
that
to
yourself
lad
so
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
say
it
returned
his
friend
with
a
and
a
twinkle
of
the
eyes
well
whoever
says
it
it
a
fact
continued
simkin
almost
sternly
an
i
make
no
bones
of
admitting
it
i
have
bin
soakin
away
right
and
left
since
i
came
to
this
country
in
spite
o
warnin
from
you
and
other
men
like
you
and
now
i
feel
as
if
all
my
boasted
strength
was
goin
out
at
my
heels
stevenson
was
silent
why
do
you
say
told
you
so
asked
simkin
sharply
because
i
say
that
it
only
riles
people
besides
continued
the
marine
earnestly
i
was
asking
god
at
the
moment
to
enable
me
to
answer
you
wisely
you
see
i
think
it
only
fair
to
reveal
some
of
my
private
thoughts
to
since
you
are
making
a
of
but
as
you
admit
that
drink
has
done
you
damage
my
dear
fellow
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
say
anything
more
on
that
subject
what
you
want
now
is
encouragement
as
to
the
future
and
advice
as
to
the
present
shall
i
give
you
both
just
now
or
shall
i
wait
firing
replied
simkin
with
a
smile
well
then
as
to
encouragement
said
stevenson
a
point
of
vital
importance
with
men
who
have
gone
in
for
drink
as
much
as
you
have
is
and
i
regard
it
as
an
evidence
of
god
love
to
you
that
he
has
brought
you
here
god
love
that
brought
me
exclaimed
the
soldier
in
surprise
well
that
a
view
o
the
case
that
do
seem
quite
plain
plain
enough
if
you
open
your
eyes
wide
enough
see
here
if
you
was
in
camp
now
with
your
present
notions
and
was
to
determine
to
give
up
drink
you
have
to
face
and
fight
two
most
tremendous
devils
one
devil
is
called
craving
the
other
is
called
temptation
and
all
the
arabs
in
the
soudan
rolled
into
one
are
not
so
terrible
or
so
strong
as
these
two
when
a
man
is
left
to
fight
them
by
himself
now
is
it
not
a
sign
of
our
father
love
that
he
has
by
bringing
you
here
removed
the
devil
temptation
entirely
out
of
your
way
for
you
ca
get
strong
drink
here
for
love
or
money
so
you
see
you
have
only
got
craving
to
fight
and
that
encouraging
ai
it
d
know
i
believe
you
are
not
far
wrong
said
simkin
gravely
and
it
encouraging
to
know
that
temptation
out
o
the
way
for
i
feel
that
the
other
devil
has
got
me
by
the
throat
even
now
and
that
him
as
has
weakened
me
so
much
that
it
friend
you
got
the
truth
by
the
tail
now
so
hold
on
but
at
the
same
time
do
be
too
hard
on
craving
it
not
fault
that
he
here
you
have
poured
liquor
down
your
throat
to
him
daily
and
cultivated
his
acquaintance
and
helped
him
to
increase
his
strength
regularly
for
many
months
it
may
be
for
years
i
do
want
to
be
hard
on
you
lad
but
it
of
no
use
shiftin
the
burden
on
to
the
wrong
shoulders
it
is
not
craving
but
who
are
the
sinner
now
as
to
advice
do
you
really
want
it
well
replied
simkin
with
a
humph
it
will
be
time
enough
for
you
to
shut
up
when
i
sound
the
firing
my
advice
then
is
that
you
go
down
on
your
knees
plead
straight
off
and
ask
for
grace
to
help
you
in
your
time
of
need
what
go
down
on
my
knees
here
before
all
them
arabs
if
i
did
not
only
laugh
at
me
but
they
soon
rouse
me
up
with
their
spears
i
not
so
sure
about
that
simkin
arabs
are
accustomed
to
go
on
their
own
knees
a
good
deal
in
public
it
is
chiefly
christians
who
strange
to
say
are
ashamed
to
be
caught
in
that
position
at
odd
times
but
i
speak
not
of
ceremonies
but
of
realities
a
man
may
go
on
his
knees
without
bending
a
joint
any
time
and
everywhere
now
listen
there
is
this
difference
between
the
courts
of
men
and
the
court
of
heaven
that
in
the
former
when
a
man
pleads
guilty
his
sentence
is
only
modified
and
softened
but
in
the
latter
the
man
who
pleads
guilty
receives
a
free
pardon
and
ultimate
deliverance
from
sin
for
the
sake
of
jesus
christ
will
you
accept
this
deliverance
my
friend
what
the
soldier
replied
in
his
heart
we
can
not
tell
for
his
voice
was
silent
before
the
conversation
could
be
resumed
a
halt
was
called
to
partake
of
the
midday
meal
and
rest
that
evening
the
party
came
upon
a
strange
and
animated
scene
it
was
one
of
the
mountain
camps
of
osman
digna
where
men
were
assembling
from
all
quarters
to
swell
the
hordes
with
which
their
chief
hoped
to
drive
the
hated
europeans
into
the
red
sea
camels
and
other
beasts
of
burden
were
bringing
in
supplies
for
the
vast
army
and
to
this
spot
had
been
brought
the
poor
fellows
who
had
been
wounded
in
recent
battles
here
the
captives
were
thrust
into
a
small
dark
hut
and
left
to
their
meditations
while
a
couple
of
arab
sentries
guarded
the
door
chapter
twenty
three
shows
that
suffering
tends
to
draw
out
sympathy
the
word
even
when
it
refers
to
civilised
lands
and
peoples
conveys
we
suspect
but
a
feeble
and
incorrect
idea
to
the
minds
of
those
who
have
never
been
in
a
state
of
personal
bondage
still
less
do
we
fully
appreciate
its
dread
significance
when
it
refers
to
foreign
lands
and
barbarous
people
it
was
not
so
much
the
indignities
to
which
the
captive
britons
were
subjected
that
told
upon
them
ultimately
as
the
hard
grinding
restless
toil
and
the
insufficient
food
and
rest
sometimes
accompanied
with
absolute
corporeal
pain
a
merciful
man
is
merciful
to
his
beast
there
is
not
much
of
mercy
to
his
beast
in
an
arab
we
have
seen
an
arab
in
algiers
who
made
use
of
a
sore
on
his
donkey
back
as
a
sort
of
convenient
spur
it
is
exhausting
to
belabour
a
and
obstinate
animal
with
a
stick
it
is
much
easier
and
much
more
effective
to
tickle
up
a
sore
kept
open
for
the
purpose
with
a
little
bit
of
stick
while
comfortably
seated
on
the
creature
back
the
fellow
we
refer
to
did
that
we
do
not
say
or
think
that
all
arabs
are
cruel
very
far
from
it
but
we
hold
that
as
a
race
they
are
so
their
great
prophet
taught
them
cruelty
by
example
and
precept
and
the
records
of
history
as
well
as
of
the
african
bear
witness
to
the
fact
that
their
tender
mercies
are
not
and
never
have
been
conspicuous
at
first
as
we
have
shown
indignities
told
pretty
severely
on
the
unfortunate
englishmen
but
as
time
went
on
and
they
were
taken
further
and
further
into
the
interior
and
heavy
burdens
were
daily
bound
on
their
shoulders
and
the
lash
was
frequently
applied
to
urge
them
on
the
keen
sense
of
insult
which
had
at
first
stirred
them
into
wild
anger
became
blunted
and
at
last
they
reached
that
condition
of
partial
apathy
which
renders
men
almost
indifferent
to
everything
save
rest
and
food
even
the
submissive
stevenson
was
growing
callous
in
short
that
process
had
begun
which
usually
ends
in
making
men
either
brutes
or
martyrs
as
before
we
must
remark
that
jack
molloy
was
to
some
extent
an
exception
it
did
seem
as
if
nothing
but
death
itself
could
subdue
that
remarkable
man
his
huge
frame
was
so
powerful
that
he
seemed
to
be
capable
of
sustaining
any
weight
his
tyrants
chose
to
put
upon
him
and
the
influence
of
hope
was
so
strong
within
him
that
it
raised
him
almost
entirely
above
the
region
of
despondency
this
was
fortunate
for
his
comrades
in
misfortune
for
it
served
to
keep
up
their
less
vigorous
spirits
there
was
one
thing
about
the
seaman
however
which
they
could
not
quite
reconcile
with
his
known
character
this
was
a
tendency
to
groan
heavily
when
he
was
being
loaded
to
be
sure
there
was
not
much
reason
for
wonder
seeing
that
the
arabs
forced
the
herculean
man
to
carry
nearly
double
the
weight
borne
by
any
of
his
companions
but
then
as
miles
once
confidentially
remarked
to
armstrong
i
thought
that
jack
molloy
would
rather
have
died
than
have
groaned
on
account
of
the
weight
of
his
burden
but
after
all
it
a
tremendously
heavy
one
poor
fellow
one
day
the
arabs
seemed
to
be
filled
with
an
unusual
desire
to
torment
their
victims
a
man
had
passed
the
band
that
day
on
a
fast
dromedary
and
the
prisoners
conjectured
that
he
might
have
brought
news
of
some
defeat
of
their
friends
which
would
account
for
their
increased
cruelty
they
were
particularly
hard
on
molloy
that
day
as
if
they
regarded
him
as
typical
of
british
strength
and
therefore
an
appropriate
object
of
revenge
after
the
midday
rest
they
not
only
put
on
him
his
ordinary
burden
but
added
to
the
enormous
weight
considerably
so
that
the
poor
fellow
staggered
under
it
and
finally
fell
down
beneath
it
with
a
very
dismal
groan
indeed
of
course
the
lash
was
at
once
applied
and
under
its
influence
the
sailor
rose
with
great
difficulty
and
staggered
forward
a
few
paces
but
only
to
fall
again
this
time
however
he
did
not
wait
for
the
lash
but
made
very
determined
efforts
of
his
own
accord
to
rise
and
advance
without
showing
the
smallest
sign
of
resentment
even
his
captors
seemed
touched
for
one
of
them
removed
a
small
portion
of
his
burden
so
that
thereafter
the
poor
fellow
proceeded
with
less
difficulty
though
still
with
a
little
staggering
and
an
occasional
groan
that
night
they
reached
a
village
near
the
banks
of
a
broad
river
where
they
put
up
for
the
night
after
their
usual
not
too
heavy
supper
was
over
the
prisoners
were
thrust
into
a
sort
of
hut
or
and
left
to
make
themselves
as
comfortable
as
they
could
on
the
bare
floor
i
do
feel
quite
so
much
inclined
for
sleep
said
miles
to
molloy
no
more
do
i
remarked
the
sailor
stretching
himself
like
a
wearied
goliath
on
the
earthen
floor
and
placing
his
arms
under
his
head
for
a
pillow
i
feel
pretty
well
used
up
too
said
simkin
throwing
himself
down
with
a
sigh
that
was
more
eloquent
than
his
tongue
he
was
indeed
anything
but
rattling
bill
by
that
time
moses
pyne
being
like
his
great
namesake
a
meek
man
sympathised
with
the
others
but
said
nothing
about
himself
though
his
looks
betrayed
him
armstrong
and
stevenson
were
silent
they
seemed
too
much
exhausted
to
indulge
in
speech
poor
fellow
said
moses
to
molloy
i
do
wonder
you
are
tired
for
you
not
only
carried
twice
as
much
as
any
of
us
but
you
took
part
of
load
indeed
he
did
comrades
added
moses
turning
to
his
friends
with
an
apologetic
air
i
did
want
him
to
do
it
but
he
jerked
part
o
my
load
suddenly
out
o
my
hand
an
would
give
it
up
again
an
you
know
i
did
dare
to
make
a
row
for
that
would
have
brought
the
lash
down
on
both
of
us
but
i
did
want
him
to
carry
so
much
an
him
so
tired
tired
exclaimed
the
sailor
with
a
loud
laugh
why
i
war
tired
a
bit
an
you
know
you
have
dropped
down
moses
if
i
helped
ye
at
that
time
well
i
confess
i
ready
to
drop
returned
moses
with
a
humbled
look
but
i
would
much
rather
have
dropped
than
have
added
to
your
burden
how
can
you
say
you
was
tired
when
you
had
fallen
down
only
five
minutes
before
an
groaned
heavily
when
you
rose
and
your
legs
trembled
so
i
could
it
to
this
the
seaman
only
reply
was
the
expansion
of
his
huge
but
handsome
mouth
the
display
of
magnificent
teeth
the
disappearance
of
both
eyes
and
a
prolonged
quiet
chuckle
why
what
the
matter
with
you
jack
asked
stevenson
nothin
the
matter
wi
me
old
man
here
he
indulged
in
another
chuckle
goin
mad
with
said
simkin
looking
suspiciously
at
him
ay
that
it
messmate
clean
mad
wi
he
wiped
his
eyes
with
the
hairy
back
of
his
hand
for
the
chuckling
being
hearty
had
produced
a
few
tears
no
but
really
jack
what
is
it
you
laughing
at
asked
armstrong
if
there
a
joke
you
might
as
well
let
us
have
the
benefit
of
laughing
along
wi
you
for
we
stand
much
in
need
of
something
to
cheer
us
here
well
billy
boy
i
may
as
well
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
said
molloy
raising
himself
on
one
elbow
and
becoming
grave
i
do
confess
to
feelin
raither
ashamed
o
myself
but
you
must
be
hard
on
me
lads
for
circumstances
alters
cases
you
know
as
solomon
said
leastwise
if
it
war
him
it
was
job
or
somebody
else
the
fact
is
i
bin
shammin
mates
shamming
ay
shammin
purtendin
that
i
was
shaky
on
the
legs
an
so
not
quite
up
to
the
cargo
they
were
puttin
aboard
o
me
if
what
you
been
doing
means
shamming
i
like
to
see
you
coming
out
observed
miles
with
a
short
laugh
well
you
see
that
too
some
day
returned
the
sailor
with
an
amiable
look
but
do
you
really
mean
that
all
that
groaning
which
i
confess
to
have
been
surprised
at
was
mere
pretence
all
sham
downright
sneakin
said
molloy
the
short
an
the
long
of
it
is
that
i
see
from
the
first
the
way
to
humbug
them
baboons
was
to
circumwent
so
i
set
to
work
at
the
wery
beginnin
ah
by
takin
a
header
said
simkin
into
one
o
their
no
no
returned
the
seaman
that
i
confess
was
a
mistake
but
you
admit
i
made
no
more
mistakes
o
the
same
sort
since
then
you
see
i
perceived
that
as
my
strength
is
considerable
above
the
average
the
baboons
would
be
likely
to
overload
me
so
arter
profound
excogitation
wi
myself
i
made
up
my
mind
what
to
do
an
when
they
had
clapped
on
a
little
more
than
the
rest
o
you
carried
i
began
to
groan
then
i
began
to
shake
a
bit
in
my
timbers
an
look
as
if
i
was
to
founder
it
did
check
much
for
they
awful
cruel
so
i
went
fairly
down
by
the
head
i
had
a
pretty
fair
guess
that
this
would
bring
the
lash
about
my
shoulders
an
i
was
right
but
i
got
up
wery
slowly
an
so
that
the
baboons
was
fairly
humbugged
and
stopped
loadin
of
me
long
afore
i
taken
in
a
full
cargo
so
you
see
boys
i
bin
sailin
raither
light
than
otherwise
but
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
the
load
you
bin
carryin
is
not
too
heavy
for
you
asked
moses
that
just
what
i
does
mean
to
tell
you
lad
i
could
carry
a
good
deal
more
an
dance
with
it
you
see
they
ai
used
to
men
o
my
size
so
i
was
able
to
humbug
into
a
miscalkilation
i
wish
i
could
have
helped
you
all
to
do
the
same
but
they
too
as
the
yankees
say
anyway
moses
you
do
need
to
trouble
your
head
when
i
gives
you
a
helpin
hand
again
ah
that
expression
helping
hand
sounds
familiar
in
my
ears
said
stevenson
in
a
sad
tone
yes
what
do
it
recall
lad
asked
molloy
extending
himself
again
on
his
broad
back
it
recalls
places
and
friends
in
portsmouth
jack
that
we
may
never
again
set
eyes
on
you
remember
the
institoot
well
they
got
a
new
branch
o
the
work
there
for
the
surrounding
civilian
poor
called
the
you
see
miss
robinson
understands
us
soldiers
out
and
out
she
knew
that
those
among
us
who
gave
up
drink
and
sin
and
put
on
the
were
not
goin
to
keep
all
the
benefit
to
ourselves
she
knew
that
we
understood
the
meaning
of
the
word
that
think
very
little
o
the
fellow
who
take
the
shillin
and
put
on
her
uniform
and
then
shirk
fightin
her
battles
and
honouring
her
flag
so
when
some
of
us
put
on
the
lord
uniform
which
like
that
of
the
austrians
is
white
and
unfurled
his
flag
she
knew
we
soon
be
wantin
to
fight
his
battles
against
sin
especially
against
drink
so
instead
of
lookin
after
our
welfare
alone
she
encouraged
us
to
hold
out
a
to
the
poorest
and
most
miserable
people
in
portsmouth
an
she
found
us
ready
to
answer
to
the
call
ah
they
was
grand
times
these
continued
the
marine
with
kindly
enthusiasm
as
he
observed
that
his
comrades
in
sorrow
were
becoming
interested
and
forgetting
for
the
moment
their
own
sorrows
and
sufferings
the
move
was
strong
in
portsmouth
at
the
time
and
many
of
the
soldiers
and
sailors
joined
it
some
time
after
we
had
held
out
a
helping
hand
to
the
poor
civilians
we
took
it
into
our
heads
to
invite
some
of
to
a
grand
in
the
big
hall
so
we
asked
a
lot
o
the
poorest
who
had
faithfully
kept
the
pledge
through
their
first
teetotal
christmas
and
it
a
scrimmage
i
can
tell
you
we
got
together
more
than
forty
of
men
and
women
and
there
were
about
three
hundred
soldiers
and
sailors
and
their
wives
to
wait
on
keep
company
capital
exclaimed
miles
who
had
a
sympathetic
spirit
especially
for
the
poor
good
good
said
molloy
nodding
his
head
that
was
the
right
thing
to
do
an
i
suppose
they
enjoyed
theirselves
enjoyed
themselves
exclaimed
the
marine
with
a
laugh
i
should
just
think
they
did
trust
miss
robinson
for
knowin
how
to
make
poor
folk
enjoy
themselves
and
for
the
matter
of
that
rich
folk
too
how
they
did
stuff
to
be
sure
many
of
poor
things
had
got
such
a
in
all
their
lives
before
you
see
they
was
the
very
poorest
of
the
poor
you
may
believe
what
i
say
for
i
went
round
myself
with
one
o
the
institoot
ladies
to
invite
and
i
do
declare
to
you
that
i
never
saw
even
pigs
or
dogs
in
such
a
state
of
destitootion
whatever
to
lie
on
but
the
bare
boards
you
do
say
so
murmured
moses
with
deep
commiseration
and
seemingly
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
he
was
himself
pretty
much
in
similar
destitution
at
that
moment
indeed
i
do
look
here
continued
the
marine
becoming
more
earnest
as
he
went
on
thousands
of
people
do
know
ca
understand
what
misery
and
want
and
suffering
is
going
on
around
city
missionaries
and
the
like
tell
about
it
and
write
about
it
but
telling
and
writin
make
people
some
things
they
must
ay
sometimes
they
must
before
they
can
rightly
understand
one
of
the
rooms
we
visited
continued
stevenson
in
pathetic
tones
belonged
to
a
poor
old
couple
who
had
been
great
drinkers
but
had
been
induced
to
put
on
the
it
was
a
of
a
room
narrow
up
a
dark
stair
they
had
no
means
of
support
the
room
was
empty
everything
had
been
pawned
the
last
thing
given
up
was
the
woman
shawl
to
pay
the
rent
and
they
were
starving
why
did
they
go
to
the
asked
simkin
the
workhouse
separates
man
and
wife
in
defiance
of
the
divine
law
god
hath
joined
together
let
no
man
put
asunder
they
was
fond
of
each
other
was
that
old
man
and
woman
and
had
lived
long
together
an
did
want
to
part
till
death
so
they
had
managed
to
stick
to
the
old
home
ay
and
they
had
stuck
to
their
colours
for
the
bit
o
blue
was
still
pinned
to
the
tattered
coat
o
the
man
and
the
thin
gown
o
the
woman
neither
coat
nor
gown
would
fetch
anything
at
the
and
there
was
no
smell
o
drink
in
the
room
well
that
old
couple
went
to
the
it
was
a
bitter
cold
night
but
they
came
all
the
same
with
nothing
to
cover
the
woman
thin
old
arms
the
moment
they
appeared
away
went
one
o
miss
robinson
workers
to
the
room
where
they
keep
chests
full
of
clothes
sent
by
charitable
folk
to
the
institoot
an
you
should
have
seen
that
old
woman
wrinkled
face
when
the
worker
returned
wi
the
thickest
worsted
shawl
she
could
lay
hold
of
an
put
it
on
her
shoulders
as
tenderly
as
if
the
old
woman
had
been
her
own
mother
at
the
same
time
they
gave
a
to
the
old
man
but
i
say
interrupted
simkin
that
christmas
feed
an
shawl
coat
would
keep
the
couple
for
a
if
they
was
sent
home
to
starve
as
before
would
it
of
course
not
returned
the
marine
but
they
was
sent
off
to
starve
they
was
looked
after
ay
an
the
people
o
the
whole
neighbourhood
are
now
looked
after
for
miss
robinson
has
bought
up
a
in
nobbs
lane
one
o
the
worst
places
in
portsmouth
converted
it
into
a
temperance
wi
lots
of
beds
to
send
people
to
when
the
institoot
overflows
an
a
for
the
destitoot
poor
an
a
for
them
and
the
soldiers
wives
an
in
short
it
has
changed
the
whole
place
but
if
i
go
on
like
this
send
moses
to
sleep
for
i
heard
smotherin
his
yawns
more
than
once
it
not
for
want
of
interest
in
what
you
sayin
though
old
man
returned
moses
with
a
tremendous
unsmothered
yawn
which
of
course
set
all
his
comrades
off
and
confirmed
them
in
the
belief
that
it
was
time
to
seek
repose
scarcely
a
single
comment
was
made
on
the
narrative
as
each
laid
his
weary
head
on
his
arm
or
on
a
folded
garment
and
stretched
himself
out
on
the
hard
ground
in
nearly
as
destitute
a
condition
as
the
poor
folk
about
whom
they
had
been
hearing
for
while
their
bed
was
as
hard
as
theirs
and
the
covering
as
scant
the
meal
they
had
recently
consumed
was
by
no
means
what
hungry
men
would
call
satisfying
there
is
reason
to
believe
however
that
their
consideration
of
the
sad
lot
of
the
poor
at
home
did
not
render
less
profound
or
sweet
that
night

chapter
twenty
four
adventures
among
the
soudanese
and
strange
meeting
with
the
mahdi
day
after
day
for
many
days
our
captives
were
thus
driven
over
the
burning
desert
suffering
intensely
from
heat
and
thirst
and
hunger
as
well
as
from
fatigue
and
treated
with
more
or
less
cruelty
according
to
the
varying
moods
of
their
guards
at
last
one
afternoon
they
arrived
at
a
city
of
considerable
size
through
the
streets
of
which
they
were
driven
with
unusual
harshness
by
the
arab
soldiers
who
seemed
to
take
pleasure
in
thus
publicly
heaping
contempt
on
christian
captives
in
the
sight
of
the
mohammedan
population
their
case
seemed
truly
desperate
to
miles
as
he
and
his
comrades
passed
through
the
narrow
streets
for
no
pitying
eye
but
many
a
frown
was
cast
on
them
by
the
crowds
who
stopped
to
gaze
and
scoff
what
city
they
had
reached
they
had
no
means
of
finding
out
being
ignorant
of
arabic
indeed
even
though
they
had
been
able
to
converse
with
their
guards
it
is
probable
that
these
would
have
refused
to
hold
communication
with
them
turning
out
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
sort
of
they
were
driven
rather
than
conducted
to
a
whitewashed
building
into
which
they
entered
through
a
low
strong
door
studded
with
large
nails
as
they
entered
a
dark
passage
the
door
was
slammed
and
locked
behind
them
at
first
owing
to
their
sudden
entrance
out
of
intensely
bright
day
they
seemed
to
be
in
profound
darkness
but
when
they
became
accustomed
to
the
dim
light
they
found
that
they
were
in
the
presence
of
several
powerful
men
who
carried
long
pistols
in
their
girdles
and
curved
naked
swords
in
their
hands
these
stood
like
statues
against
the
wall
of
the
small
room
silently
awaiting
the
orders
of
one
whose
dress
betokened
him
of
superior
rank
and
who
was
engaged
in
writing
with
a
reed
in
persian
characters
a
tall
very
negro
stood
beside
this
officer
after
a
few
minutes
the
latter
laid
down
the
reed
rose
up
and
confronted
the
prisoners
at
the
same
time
addressing
some
remark
to
his
attendant
who
is
you
an
where
you
come
fro
asked
the
negro
addressing
himself
to
miles
whom
he
seemed
intuitively
to
recognise
as
the
chief
of
his
party
we
are
british
soldiers
said
miles
drawing
himself
up
with
an
air
of
dignity
that
would
have
done
credit
to
the
emperor
of
china
you
see
at
that
moment
he
felt
himself
to
be
the
spokesman
for
and
with
his
comrades
the
representative
of
the
entire
british
army
and
was
put
upon
his
mettle
accordingly
we
come
from
suakim
ay
broke
in
jack
molloy
at
that
moment
and
you
may
tell
him
that
if
he
has
the
pluck
to
go
to
suakim
he
see
plenty
more
british
soldiers
an
british
seamen
too
who
give
him
an
his
friends
a
hot
and
hearty
welcome
wi
bullet
bayonet
and
cutlash
whenever
he
feels
inclined
are
you
officer
asked
the
negro
of
miles
and
not
paying
the
smallest
attention
to
molloy
warlike
invitation
no
i
am
not
turning
to
the
armed
men
the
officer
gave
them
an
order
which
caused
them
to
advance
and
stand
close
to
the
englishmen
two
beside
each
prisoner
with
drawn
swords
an
extra
man
took
up
his
position
behind
molloy
evidently
having
regard
to
his
superior
size
then
two
men
who
looked
like
jailers
advanced
to
stevenson
cut
the
cords
that
bound
his
arms
and
proceeded
to
put
iron
fetters
on
his
wrists
comrades
said
molloy
in
a
low
voice
when
he
perceived
that
his
turn
was
coming
shall
we
make
a
burst
for
it
kill
them
all
get
out
into
street
cut
and
slash
through
the
town
and
make
a
grand
run
for
it
or
die
like
men
die
like
fools
growled
simkin
as
he
suffered
his
hands
to
be
manacled
no
no
jack
said
armstrong
do
be
rash
let
bide
our
time
there
no
sayin
what
turn
up
well
well
sighed
molloy
resigning
himself
to
his
fate
only
one
thing
now
that
sartin
sure
to
turn
up
an
that
is
the
sod
that
cover
our
graves
you
not
sure
even
of
that
man
said
moses
pyne
who
was
beginning
to
give
way
to
despair
for
they
only
dig
a
hole
in
the
sand
an
shove
us
in
more
likely
to
leave
the
dogs
an
vultures
to
clear
us
out
o
the
way
said
simkin
whose
powers
of
hope
were
being
tested
almost
beyond
endurance
while
the
prisoners
indulged
in
these
gloomy
anticipations
the
operation
of
fixing
their
irons
was
finished
after
which
they
were
taken
across
an
inner
court
which
was
open
to
the
sky
at
the
other
side
of
this
they
came
to
another
heavy
door
which
when
opened
disclosed
a
flight
of
steps
descending
into
profound
darkness
go
in
said
the
negro
who
had
accompanied
them
molloy
who
was
first
hesitated
and
the
tremendous
flush
on
his
face
and
frown
on
his
shaggy
brows
seemed
to
indicate
that
even
yet
he
meditated
attempting
his
favourite
burst
but
stevenson
pushing
past
him
at
once
descended
saying
as
he
went
do
be
foolish
jack
we
learn
to
submit
there
were
only
three
steps
and
at
the
bottom
a
room
about
fifteen
feet
square
to
enlighten
which
there
was
a
small
hole
high
up
in
one
of
the
walls
it
did
little
more
however
than
render
darkness
visible
god
help
us
exclaimed
miles
with
a
sensation
of
sinking
at
the
heart
which
he
had
never
felt
before
and
little
wonder
for
as
their
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
dim
light
it
was
seen
that
the
walls
were
blank
with
nothing
on
them
to
relieve
the
eye
save
the
little
hole
or
window
just
mentioned
that
the
floor
was
of
hard
earth
and
that
there
was
not
a
scrap
of
furniture
in
the
room
not
even
a
stool
or
a
bundle
of
straw
on
which
to
lie
down
will
trust
and
not
be
afraid
said
stevenson
in
a
low
voice
who
will
you
trust
asked
simkin
who
was
not
aware
that
his
comrade
had
quoted
scripture
i
will
trust
god
answered
the
marine
i
would
give
much
for
your
trust
then
returned
simkin
bitterly
as
well
as
contemptuously
for
he
had
given
way
to
despair
you
blue
lights
and
christians
think
yourselves
so
much
better
than
everybody
else
because
you
make
so
much
talk
about
prayin
an
singin
an
your
duty
an
servin
god
an
submitting
it
all
hypocrisy
do
you
believe
that
sergeant
hardy
is
a
good
soldier
asked
stevenson
of
course
i
do
replied
simkin
in
some
surprise
at
the
question
an
does
think
much
of
himself
does
he
continued
the
marine
certainly
not
he
one
o
the
kindest
an
humblest
men
in
the
regiment
as
i
have
good
reason
to
know
yet
he
frequently
talks
to
us
of
attendin
to
our
duty
an
credit
to
the
british
flag
an
faithfully
serving
the
queen
if
this
is
praiseworthy
in
the
sergeant
why
should
the
talk
of
duty
an
service
an
honour
to
god
be
hypocrisy
in
the
christian
does
it
not
seem
strange
that
we
blue
lights
who
have
discovered
ourselves
to
be
much
worse
than
we
thought
ourselves
an
gladly
accept
jesus
as
our
saviour
from
sin
should
be
charged
with
thinkin
ourselves
than
other
people
come
now
cried
jack
molloy
seating
himself
on
the
floor
and
leaning
his
back
against
the
wall
it
do
seem
to
me
as
you
putt
it
stevenson
that
the
charge
ought
to
be
all
the
other
way
for
we
who
make
no
purfession
of
religion
at
all
thinks
ourselves
so
far
righteous
that
we
got
no
need
of
a
saviour
suppose
now
as
we
got
to
as
low
a
state
o
the
dumps
as
men
can
well
come
to
we
all
sits
down
in
a
row
an
have
a
palaver
about
this
matter
parson
stevenson
bein
the
chief
spokesman
they
all
readily
agreed
to
this
proposal
indeed
in
the
circumstances
any
proposal
that
offered
the
faintest
hope
of
diverting
their
minds
from
present
trouble
would
have
been
welcome
to
them
at
that
moment
the
marine
was
nothing
loath
to
fall
in
with
the
fancy
of
his
irrepressible
comrade
but
we
do
not
propose
to
follow
them
in
the
talk
that
ensued
we
will
rather
turn
at
once
to
those
events
which
affected
more
immediately
the
fortunes
of
the
captives
on
the
morning
after
their
arrival
in
the
city
there
was
assembled
in
the
principal
square
a
considerable
concourse
of
soudan
warriors
they
stood
chatting
together
in
various
groups
in
front
of
a
public
building
as
if
awaiting
some
chief
or
great
man
whose
richly
caparisoned
steed
stood
in
front
of
the
main
entrance
with
its
standing
before
it
this
runner
was
a
splendid
specimen
of
physical
manhood
he
was
as
black
as
coal
as
graceful
as
apollo
and
apparently
as
powerful
as
hercules
if
one
might
judge
from
the
great
muscles
which
stood
out
prominently
on
all
his
limbs
he
wore
but
little
clothing
merely
a
pair
of
short
arab
drawers
of
white
cotton
a
red
fez
on
his
head
and
a
small
tippet
on
his
shoulders
unlike
negroes
in
general
his
features
were
cast
in
a
mould
which
one
is
more
accustomed
to
see
in
the
caucasian
race
of
mankind
the
nose
being
straight
the
lips
comparatively
thin
and
the
face
oval
while
his
bearing
was
that
of
a
man
accustomed
to
command
the
appearance
of
a
few
soldiers
traversing
the
square
drew
the
eyes
of
all
in
their
direction
and
caused
a
brief
pause
in
the
hum
of
conversation
our
friends
the
captives
were
in
the
midst
of
these
soldiers
and
beside
them
marched
the
negro
interpreter
whom
they
had
first
met
with
in
the
prison
at
the
door
of
the
public
building
the
soldiers
drew
up
and
allowed
the
captives
to
pass
in
guarded
by
two
officers
and
the
interpreter
inside
they
found
a
number
of
military
men
and
dignitaries
grouped
around
conversing
with
a
stern
man
of
strongly
marked
features
this
man
towards
whom
all
of
them
showed
great
deference
was
engaged
when
the
captives
entered
they
were
therefore
obliged
to
stand
aside
for
a
few
minutes
who
is
he
asked
molloy
of
the
negro
interpreter
our
great
leader
said
the
negro
the
mahdi
what
the
scoundrel
that
bin
the
cause
o
all
this
asked
jack
molloy
in
surprise
the
interpreter
did
not
quite
understand
the
seaman
peculiar
language
but
he
seemed
to
have
some
idea
of
the
drift
of
it
for
he
turned
up
his
nose
in
scorn
and
made
no
reply
in
a
few
minutes
an
officer
led
the
captives
before
the
mahdi
who
regarded
them
with
a
dark
frown
directing
his
attention
particularly
to
jack
molloy
as
being
the
most
conspicuous
member
of
the
party
perhaps
also
because
molloy
looked
at
him
with
an
air
and
expression
of
stern
defiance
selecting
him
as
a
spokesman
for
the
others
the
mahdi
using
the
negro
as
an
interpreter
put
him
through
the
following
examination
where
do
you
come
from
he
asked
sternly
from
suakim
answered
molloy
quite
as
sternly
what
brought
you
here
your
baboons
it
is
probable
that
the
negro
used
some
discretion
in
translating
this
reply
for
the
chief
did
not
seem
at
all
offended
but
with
the
same
manner
and
tone
continued
do
you
know
the
number
of
men
in
suakim
yes
tell
me
how
many
to
this
molloy
answered
slowly
quite
enough
if
you
had
only
the
pluck
to
come
out
into
the
open
an
fight
like
men
to
give
you
such
a
that
there
would
be
a
baboon
o
you
left
in
the
whole
soudan
again
it
is
probable
that
the
interpreter
did
not
give
this
speech
verbatim
for
while
he
was
delivering
it
the
mahdi
was
scanning
the
features
of
the
group
of
prisoners
with
a
calm
but
keen
eye
making
a
sign
to
one
of
his
attendants
to
lead
molloy
to
one
side
he
said
a
few
words
to
another
who
thereupon
placed
miles
in
front
of
his
master
are
you
an
officer
was
the
first
question
put
no
answered
our
hero
with
quiet
dignity
but
without
the
slightest
tinge
of
defiance
either
in
tone
or
look
will
you
tell
me
how
many
men
you
have
in
suakim
no
dare
you
refuse
yes
it
is
against
the
principles
of
a
british
soldier
to
give
information
to
an
enemy
that
right
john
miles
said
molloy
in
an
encouraging
tone
give
it
hot
they
can
only
kill
us
once
an
silence
hissed
the
mahdi
between
his
teeth
silence
echoed
the
interpreter
all
right
you
nigger
tell
the
baboon
to
go
on
i
wo
run
foul
of
him
again
he
ai
worth
it
this
was
said
with
contempt
do
you
not
know
resumed
the
mahdi
turning
again
to
miles
with
a
fierce
expression
that
i
have
power
to
take
your
life
you
have
no
power
at
all
beyond
what
god
gives
to
you
said
miles
quietly
even
the
angry
mahdi
was
impressed
with
the
obvious
truth
of
this
statement
but
his
anger
was
not
much
allayed
by
it
know
you
not
he
continued
that
i
have
the
power
to
torture
you
to
death
our
hero
did
not
at
once
reply
he
felt
that
a
grand
crisis
in
his
life
had
arrived
that
he
stood
there
before
an
assemblage
of
unbelievers
and
that
to
some
extent
the
credit
of
his
countrymen
for
courage
fidelity
and
christianity
was
placed
in
his
hands
mahdi
he
said
impressively
as
he
drew
himself
up
you
have
indeed
the
power
to
torture
and
kill
me
but
you
have
the
power
to
open
my
lips
or
cause
me
to
bring
dishonour
on
my
country
brayvo
johnny
pitch
into
him
cried
the
delighted
molloy
fool
exclaimed
the
mahdi
whose
ire
was
rekindled
as
much
by
the
seaman
uncomprehended
comment
as
by
our
hero
fearless
look
and
tone
you
can
not
bring
dishonour
on
a
country
which
is
already
dishonoured
what
dishonour
can
exceed
that
of
being
leagued
with
the
oppressor
against
the
oppressed
go
you
shall
be
taught
to
sympathise
with
the
oppressed
by
suffering
oppression
he
waved
his
hand
and
quickly
leaving
the
court
walked
towards
his
horse
where
the
negro
runner
stood
and
held
his
stirrup
while
he
prepared
to
mount
instead
of
mounting
however
he
stood
for
a
few
seconds
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
ground
then
he
spoke
a
few
words
to
the
runner
who
bowed
his
head
slightly
as
his
master
mounted
and
rode
away
grasping
a
small
lance
and
flag
which
seemed
to
be
the
emblems
of
his
office
he
ran
off
at
full
speed
in
front
of
the
horse
to
clear
the
way
for
his
master
at
the
entrance
to
the
building
an
official
of
some
sort
took
hold
of
miles
arm
and
led
him
away
he
glanced
back
and
observed
that
two
armed
men
followed
at
the
same
time
he
saw
molloy
head
towering
above
the
surrounding
crowd
as
he
and
his
comrades
were
led
away
in
another
direction
that
was
the
last
he
saw
of
some
at
least
of
his
friends
for
a
considerable
time
poor
miles
was
too
much
distressed
at
this
sudden
and
unexpected
separation
to
take
much
note
of
the
things
around
him
he
was
brought
back
to
a
somewhat
anxious
consideration
of
his
own
affairs
by
being
halted
at
the
gate
of
a
building
which
was
more
imposing
both
in
size
and
appearance
than
the
houses
around
it
entering
at
the
bidding
of
his
conductors
he
found
himself
in
an
open
court
and
heard
the
heavy
door
closed
and
bolted
behind
him
thereafter
he
was
conducted
to
a
small
chamber
which
although
extremely
simple
and
almost
devoid
of
furniture
was
both
cleaner
and
lighter
than
that
in
which
he
and
his
comrades
had
been
at
first
immured
he
observed
however
with
a
feeling
of
despondency
that
it
was
lighted
only
by
small
square
holes
in
the
roof
and
that
the
door
was
very
substantial
here
his
conductor
left
him
without
saying
a
word
and
bolted
the
door
as
he
listened
to
the
retreating
steps
of
his
jailer
echoing
on
the
marble
pavement
of
the
court
a
feeling
of
profound
dejection
fell
upon
our
hero
spirit
and
he
experienced
an
almost
irresistible
tendency
to
give
way
to
unmanly
tears
shame
however
came
to
his
aid
and
enabled
him
to
restrain
them
in
one
corner
of
the
little
room
there
was
a
piece
of
thick
matting
sitting
down
on
it
with
his
back
against
the
wall
the
poor
youth
laid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
began
to
think
and
to
pray
but
the
prayer
was
not
audible
and
who
can
describe
the
wide
range
of
thought
the
grief
the
anxiety
for
comrades
as
well
as
for
himself
the
remorse
the
intense
longing
to
recall
the
past
the
wish
that
he
might
awake
and
find
that
it
was
only
a
wild
dream
and
above
all
the
bitter
almost
vengeful
he
was
aroused
from
this
condition
by
the
entrance
of
a
slave
bearing
a
round
wooden
tray
on
which
were
a
bowl
of
food
and
a
jug
of
water
placing
these
before
him
the
slave
retired
without
speaking
though
he
bestowed
a
glance
of
curiosity
on
the
white
infidel
dog
before
closing
the
door
appetite
had
ever
been
a
staunch
friend
to
miles
milton
it
did
not
fail
him
now
has
usually
the
effect
of
making
its
devotees
acutely
careful
to
take
advantage
of
all
opportunities
he
set
to
work
on
the
bowlful
of
food
with
a
will
and
was
not
solicitous
to
ascertain
what
it
consisted
of
until
it
was
safely
washed
down
with
a
draught
from
the
jug
being
then
too
late
to
enter
on
an
inquiry
as
to
its
nature
he
contented
himself
with
a
pleasing
recollection
that
the
main
body
of
the
compost
was
rice
one
of
the
constituents
oil
and
that
the
whole
was
by
no
means
bad
he
also
wished
that
there
had
been
more
of
it
and
then
resumed
his
previous
and
only
possible
amusement
of
meditation
thinking
like
fighting
is
better
done
on
a
full
stomach
he
had
gradually
thought
himself
into
a
more
hopeful
state
of
mind
when
he
was
again
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
visitors
two
armed
men
and
the
magnificent
negro
runner
whom
he
had
observed
holding
the
mahdi
horse
one
of
the
armed
men
carried
a
small
bundle
which
he
deposited
on
the
ground
and
then
stood
beside
his
companion
both
stood
like
sentinels
with
drawn
swords
ready
apparently
to
obey
the
commands
of
the
runner
advancing
to
the
captive
the
latter
producing
a
key
unlocked
and
removed
his
manacles
these
he
handed
to
one
of
the
men
and
turning
again
to
miles
said
to
his
great
surprise
in
english
undress
and
put
on
de
in
bundle
we
may
here
observe
that
up
to
this
time
miles
and
his
comrades
in
adversity
had
worn
day
and
night
the
garments
in
which
they
had
been
captured
our
hero
was
not
sorry
therefore
at
the
prospect
of
a
change
untying
the
bundle
to
see
what
substitute
was
given
for
his
uniform
he
found
that
it
contained
only
a
pair
of
loose
cotton
drawers
and
a
red
fez
is
this
all
he
asked
in
surprise
all
answered
the
negro
and
what
if
i
refuse
to
undress
asked
miles
your
will
be
tore
off
your
back
and
you
be
bastinado
this
was
said
so
calmly
and
the
three
grave
powerful
men
seemed
so
thoroughly
capable
of
performing
the
deed
that
our
hero
wisely
submitted
to
the
inevitable
and
took
off
his
uniform
which
one
of
the
guards
gathered
up
piece
by
piece
as
it
was
removed
then
he
pulled
on
the
drawers
which
covered
him
from
the
waist
to
a
little
below
the
knees
when
he
had
put
on
the
red
fez
he
found
himself
clothed
in
exactly
the
same
costume
as
the
runner
with
the
exception
of
a
small
green
tippet
which
barely
covered
the
top
of
his
shoulders
and
seemed
to
be
worn
rather
as
an
ornament
than
a
piece
of
clothing
though
perhaps
it
formed
a
slight
protection
from
the
sun
in
this
cool
costume
they
left
him
carrying
away
his
uniform
as
if
more
thoroughly
to
impress
on
him
what
uncommonly
cool
things
they
were
capable
of
doing
in
the
hot
regions
of
the
soudan
chapter
twenty
five
miles
is
promoted
molloy
overthrows
the
mahdi
and
is
elevated
for
so
doing
next
day
miles
milton
became
painfully
aware
of
the
fact
that
his
life
in
captivity
was
not
to
be
one
of
ease
or
idleness
soon
after
daybreak
the
door
of
his
prison
creaked
on
its
ponderous
hinges
and
he
started
up
from
the
mat
on
which
he
had
slept
without
covering
of
any
kind
his
visitor
was
the
mahdi
runner
who
after
closing
the
door
came
and
sat
down
beside
him
cross
legged
turk
and
tailor
for
a
brief
space
the
handsome
black
stared
steadily
at
miles
who
returned
the
compliment
as
steadily
not
being
sure
whether
curiosity
or
insolence
lay
at
the
foundation
of
the
stare
englishmin
said
the
runner
at
last
you
is
unfortnit
i
am
indeed
returned
miles
at
the
same
time
i
am
fortunate
in
so
unexpectedly
finding
one
who
recognises
the
fact
and
who
can
tell
me
so
in
my
own
tongue
may
i
venture
to
hope
that
you
are
friendly
towards
me
yes
i
am
your
friend
but
my
friendness
can
do
for
you
like
youself
i
am
captive
slave
but
in
my
own
land
i
was
a
chief
and
friend
of
the
great
and
good
gordon
so
i
is
friend
to
all
englishmin
once
i
was
to
gordon
but
the
mahdi
came
i
fell
into
his
hands
and
now
i
do
run
befront
his
horse
an
hold
de
stirrup
i
comes
to
you
from
the
mahdi
wid
bad
news
indeed
but
i
need
not
wonder
you
could
scarcely
come
from
him
with
good
news
what
have
you
to
tell
the
mahdi
has
made
you
his
runner
answered
the
negro
that
is
strange
news
rather
than
bad
is
it
not
no
it
is
bad
he
do
dis
he
hate
you
somehow
you
has
anger
him
he
say
he
will
tame
you
he
try
to
tame
said
the
negro
with
sudden
and
tremendous
ferocity
an
him
he
do
it
but
i
only
waits
my
chance
to
kill
him
now
he
send
me
again
to
dirty
work
an
put
you
in
my
place
to
humble
you
to
insult
you
before
every
one
who
will
say
de
bold
christin
dog
lick
de
dust
now
an
hold
de
mahdi
stirrup
this
is
indeed
bad
news
but
how
is
it
that
you
who
seem
to
be
free
do
not
use
your
opportunity
to
escape
i
saw
you
holding
the
horse
it
seems
to
be
a
splendid
one
why
did
you
not
jump
on
its
back
and
fly
the
runner
frowned
and
then
changing
his
mood
smiled
sadly
you
is
young
he
said
and
knows
at
night
i
am
locked
up
like
yourself
in
de
de
city
is
full
of
enemies
who
all
knows
me
do
you
dey
will
salute
and
say
in
peace
to
de
runner
of
de
mahdi
when
he
is
running
away
with
his
best
horse
perhaps
not
said
miles
but
i
would
try
if
i
were
you
you
will
be
me
very
soon
returned
the
runner
and
you
can
try
i
did
try
twice
i
was
caught
both
times
and
beat
near
to
death
but
i
did
not
die
i
learn
wisdom
and
now
i
submit
and
wait
my
chance
to
kill
him
if
you
is
wise
you
begin
to
submit
and
wait
too
there
is
truth
in
what
you
say
rejoined
miles
after
a
few
thought
i
will
take
your
advice
and
submit
and
wait
but
only
till
the
opportunity
to
escape
offers
i
would
not
murder
the
man
even
if
i
had
the
chance
your
words
remind
me
of
de
good
gordon
he
was
not
vengeful
he
loved
god
said
the
runner
in
a
low
and
very
different
tone
but
he
added
gordon
was
a
white
man
he
did
not
could
not
understand
de
feelings
of
de
black
chief
as
the
last
remark
opened
up
ground
which
miles
was
not
prepared
to
traverse
he
made
no
rejoinder
but
asked
the
runner
what
the
mahdi
required
of
him
in
his
new
capacity
he
require
you
to
learn
de
city
so
as
you
know
how
to
run
when
you
is
told
an
i
is
to
teach
you
so
you
come
wid
me
said
the
runner
rising
but
am
i
to
go
in
this
costume
or
rather
in
this
state
asked
miles
rising
and
spreading
out
his
hands
as
he
looked
down
at
his
unclothed
chest
and
lower
limbs
you
not
cause
for
be
ashamed
replied
the
runner
with
a
nod
this
was
true
for
the
hard
travelling
which
miles
had
recently
endured
and
the
heavy
burdens
which
he
had
borne
had
developed
his
muscles
to
such
an
extent
that
his
frame
was
almost
equal
to
that
of
the
negro
and
a
fit
subject
for
the
sculptor
chisel
your
white
skin
will
blister
at
first
continued
the
runner
but
your
master
will
be
glad
for
dat
here
is
a
however
will
save
you
shoulders
now
you
makes
runner
he
took
the
little
green
tippet
off
his
own
shoulders
and
fastened
it
on
those
of
his
successor
come
now
he
added
let
us
see
how
you
can
run
they
passed
out
into
the
street
together
and
then
poor
miles
felt
the
full
sense
of
his
degradation
when
he
saw
some
of
the
stop
to
gaze
with
looks
of
hatred
or
contempt
or
amusement
at
the
christian
captive
but
he
had
not
much
leisure
to
think
or
feel
for
the
negro
ran
him
down
one
street
and
up
another
at
a
pace
which
would
soon
have
exhausted
him
if
besides
being
a
naturally
good
runner
he
had
not
recently
been
forced
to
undergo
such
severe
training
during
the
run
his
guide
pointed
out
and
named
most
of
the
chief
places
buildings
and
mosques
you
will
do
said
the
negro
pausing
at
length
and
turning
towards
his
companion
with
a
look
of
approval
you
so
good
as
myself
with
this
compliment
he
proceeded
to
instruct
the
new
runner
in
his
duties
and
at
night
miles
found
himself
again
in
his
prison
ready
to
do
full
justice
to
his
bowl
of
and
to
enjoy
his
mat
bed
if
a
man
can
be
said
to
enjoy
anything
about
which
he
is
profoundly
unconscious
during
the
time
of
its
enjoyment
next
morning
he
awoke
with
a
sensation
that
led
him
for
a
moment
to
fancy
he
must
have
gone
to
bed
while
he
was
waiting
impatiently
for
breakfast
he
revolved
several
ideas
in
his
mind
one
of
which
was
that
come
what
might
he
would
not
suffer
any
indignity
however
gross
to
get
the
better
of
him
he
would
take
a
leaf
out
of
his
friend
stevenson
book
and
bear
patiently
whatever
was
sent
to
him
in
the
hope
that
by
so
doing
he
might
gain
the
of
his
captors
and
thus
perhaps
be
in
a
better
position
to
take
advantage
of
any
opportunity
to
escape
that
might
occur
he
was
very
confident
of
his
power
of
and
trusted
a
good
deal
to
that
determination
of
will
which
we
have
before
referred
to
as
being
one
of
his
characteristics
that
same
day
his
powers
were
severely
tested
all
the
morning
he
was
left
in
his
prison
to
fret
in
idleness
but
towards
the
afternoon
he
was
called
by
his
friend
the
to
go
out
to
his
work
do
what
you
is
told
an
hold
you
tongue
an
keep
your
eyes
on
de
ground
dems
my
advice
said
the
negro
as
he
resigned
the
bridle
of
the
mahdi
steed
to
his
successor
and
placed
the
lance
of
office
in
his
hand
just
as
he
did
so
the
mahdi
came
out
of
a
and
advanced
towards
them
while
the
negro
retired
and
mingled
with
the
crowd
which
had
assembled
to
see
the
chief
mount
his
horse
miles
tried
faithfully
to
attend
to
his
friend
injunctions
but
could
not
resist
one
glance
at
his
new
master
which
showed
him
that
a
cynical
smile
rested
on
his
swarthy
countenance
a
smile
which
he
also
observed
was
copied
by
those
of
the
crowd
who
did
not
prefer
to
regard
him
with
scowling
looks
for
the
people
of
the
soudan
were
naturally
enough
filled
with
indignation
against
all
europeans
and
especially
against
the
british
at
that
time
the
glance
did
not
improve
miles
state
of
mind
nevertheless
he
forced
himself
to
look
at
the
ground
with
an
utterly
expressionless
face
as
he
held
the
mahdi
stirrup
he
received
a
slight
push
from
his
foot
instead
of
thanks
when
he
had
mounted
but
miles
resolutely
kept
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
restrained
his
rising
wrath
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
the
mahdi
wished
to
point
out
the
direction
in
which
he
was
to
run
a
smart
blow
from
the
on
his
naked
back
aroused
him
to
his
duty
and
caused
a
slight
laugh
among
the
onlookers
never
before
perhaps
was
the
mahdi
so
near
his
end
as
at
that
moment
for
as
our
hero
felt
the
sting
and
heard
the
low
laugh
all
the
blood
in
his
body
seemed
to
leap
into
his
brow
and
the
lance
of
office
quivered
as
his
hand
tightened
on
it
the
fact
that
two
guards
with
drawn
swords
stood
at
his
side
and
that
their
weapons
would
have
been
in
his
heart
before
he
could
have
accomplished
the
deed
would
probably
have
failed
to
restrain
him
had
not
his
pride
of
purpose
as
we
may
style
it
come
to
his
aid
he
looked
up
with
a
frown
indeed
but
without
uttering
a
word
the
mahdi
pointed
along
one
of
the
streets
and
miles
instantly
bounded
away
heartily
glad
to
be
able
to
let
off
his
superfluous
feeling
in
violent
action
for
several
hours
his
master
kept
him
running
evidently
on
purpose
to
try
his
powers
as
a
jockey
might
test
the
qualities
of
a
new
horse
and
strong
though
he
was
the
poor
youth
began
at
last
to
feel
greatly
distressed
and
to
pant
a
good
deal
still
his
pride
and
a
determination
not
to
be
beaten
sustained
him
at
one
point
of
his
course
he
was
passing
a
band
of
slaves
who
were
labouring
to
lift
a
large
beam
of
wood
when
the
sound
of
a
familiar
voice
caused
him
to
look
up
and
then
he
saw
his
friend
jack
molloy
in
costume
like
his
own
the
fez
and
tippet
with
one
of
his
great
shoulders
under
the
beam
and
the
sweat
pouring
down
his
face
hallo
miles
exclaimed
the
seaman
but
our
hero
did
not
dare
to
pause
and
could
not
speak
his
glancing
aside
however
had
the
effect
of
causing
him
to
stumble
and
being
too
much
exhausted
at
the
time
to
recover
himself
he
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
as
he
slowly
rose
up
the
mahdi
could
scarcely
avoid
riding
him
down
as
it
was
he
stooped
and
a
second
time
laid
his
smartly
on
the
poor
youth
naked
shoulders
jack
molloy
who
saw
the
cruel
act
lost
all
control
of
himself
uttered
one
of
his
leonine
roars
sprang
into
the
middle
of
the
road
and
seized
the
reins
of
the
mahdi
horse
the
startled
animal
reared
and
attempted
to
swerve
molloy
assisted
the
swerve
by
a
violent
at
the
reins
at
the
same
time
he
caught
one
of
the
upraised
forelegs
and
with
an
almost
superhuman
exertion
of
strength
hurled
both
horse
and
rider
to
the
ground
a
very
howl
of
consternation
and
amazement
burst
from
the
populace
as
they
beheld
their
mahdi
lying
flat
and
motionless
on
his
back
as
if
dead
of
course
jack
molloy
was
instantly
seized
by
an
overpowering
number
of
soldiers
bound
hand
and
foot
and
carried
back
to
his
dungeon
while
the
mahdi
was
tenderly
raised
and
conveyed
to
the
house
which
he
inhabited
at
that
time
miles
had
also
been
seized
and
dragged
somewhat
violently
back
to
his
prison
as
for
the
other
members
of
the
captive
band
none
of
them
were
there
at
the
time
they
were
all
separated
at
the
time
our
hero
was
taken
from
them
and
each
remained
for
a
considerable
time
in
ignorance
of
the
fate
of
his
fellows
we
may
say
at
once
here
that
they
were
all
put
to
severe
and
menial
labour
each
also
had
his
uniform
exchanged
for
a
pair
of
arabian
drawers
and
a
felt
cap
or
a
fez
so
that
they
were
little
better
than
naked
this
would
have
mattered
little
the
weather
being
very
warm
if
their
skins
had
been
accustomed
to
the
powerful
rays
of
a
tropical
sun
but
the
effect
on
them
was
so
severe
that
their
taskmasters
in
an
unwonted
gush
of
pity
at
last
gave
them
each
a
loose
garment
of
sacking
which
served
as
a
partial
protection
after
the
incident
which
has
just
been
related
miles
was
permitted
to
remain
during
the
rest
of
that
day
and
night
in
his
room
not
so
jack
molloy
the
anger
of
the
populace
was
so
powerfully
aroused
against
the
impetuous
sailor
that
they
clamoured
for
his
instant
execution
and
at
last
unable
or
unwilling
to
resist
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
the
officers
in
charge
of
him
gave
in
they
put
a
rope
round
his
neck
and
led
him
to
a
spot
where
criminals
were
wont
to
be
executed
as
he
went
along
and
saw
only
scowling
faces
whenever
he
looked
round
in
the
hope
of
meeting
some
pitying
eye
the
poor
man
began
to
feel
convinced
that
his
last
hour
had
in
very
truth
arrived
well
well
who
ha
thowt
it
would
ever
come
to
this
he
sighed
shaking
his
head
mournfully
as
he
came
in
sight
of
the
place
of
execution
but
after
all
ye
richly
desarve

john
molloy
for
you
bin
a
bad
lot
the
greater
part
o
your
life
again
he
looked
on
either
side
of
him
for
hope
was
strongly
enshrined
in
his
broad
bosom
but
not
a
friendly
or
even
pitiful
face
could
he
see
among
all
the
hundreds
that
surrounded
him
arrived
at
the
place
he
glanced
up
at
the
beam
over
his
head
and
for
one
moment
thought
of
trying
like
samson
to
burst
the
bonds
that
held
him
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
the
impossibility
of
freeing
himself
was
too
obvious
he
meekly
bowed
his
head
another
instant
and
the
rope
tightened
round
his
neck
and
he
felt
himself
swinging
in
the
air
before
his
senses
had
quite
left
him
however
he
felt
his
feet
again
touch
the
ground
the
choking
sensation
passed
away
and
he
found
himself
supported
by
two
men
a
burst
of
mocking
laughter
then
proved
to
the
wretched
man
that
his
tormentors
had
practised
on
him
the
refined
cruelty
of
him
if
he
had
had
any
doubt
on
this
subject
the
remark
of
the
interpreter
as
he
afterwards
left
him
in
his
cell

cruel

despair
followed
by
hope
and
a
joyful
discovery
after
the
rough
treatment
he
had
received
the
mahdi
as
we
may
well
believe
did
not
feel
more
amiably
disposed
towards
his
prisoners
of
course
he
had
no
reason
for
blaming
miles
for
what
had
occurred
nevertheless
he
vented
his
wrath
against
white
men
in
general
on
him
by
keeping
him
constantly
on
the
move
and
enforcing
prolonged
and
unusual
speed
while
running
besides
subjecting
him
publicly
to
many
insults
it
was
a
strange
school
in
which
to
learn
and
humility
but
our
hero
profited
by
the
schooling
necessity
is
a
stern
teacher
and
she
was
the
of
that
school
among
other
things
she
taught
miles
to
reason
extensively
not
very
profoundly
perhaps
nor
always
correctly
but
at
all
events
in
a
way
that
he
never
reasoned
before
the
best
way
to
convey
to
the
reader
the
state
of
his
mind
will
be
to
let
him
speak
for
himself
as
he
had
a
habit
of
thinking
aloud
for
sociability
as
it
were
in
the
dark
cell
to
which
he
had
been
relegated
we
have
only
to
bend
down
our
ear
and
listen
one
night
about
a
week
after
the
overthrow
of
his
tyrant
master
miles
was
seated
on
the
hard
floor
of
his
cell
leaning
against
the
wall
with
his
knees
drawn
up
and
his
face
in
his
hands
his
usual
attitude
when
engaged
in
meditation
after
a
hard
day
work
i
would
mind
so
much
he
murmured
if
i
only
saw
the
faintest
prospect
of
its
coming
to
an
end
but
to
go
on
thus
from
day
to
day
perhaps
year
to
year
is
terrible
no
that
can
not
be
if
we
can
not
escape
it
wo
be
long
till
the
end
comes
a
pause
the
end
the
end
of
a

a
noose

it

likely
to
be

it

to

the
poor
wretches
are
only
defending
their

after

besides
you
deserve
what
you
got
for

meanly
forsaking

miles
when
you
feel
tempted
to
stick
your
lance
into
the

as
molloy
would
have
said
ah
poor
molloy
i
fear
that
i
shall
never
see
you
again
in
this
life
after
giving
the
mahdi
and
his
steed
such
a
tremendous
heave
they
would
be
sure
to
kill
you
perhaps
they
tortured

he
stopped
at
this
point
with
an
involuntary
shudder
i
hope
not
he
resumed
after
another
pause
i
hope
we
may
yet
meet
and
devise
some
means
of
escape
god
grant
it
true
the
desert
is
vast
and
scorching
and
almost
waterless
i
may
as
well
say
foodless
too
and
it
swarms
with
foes
but
what
then
have
not
most
of
the
great
deeds
of
earth
been
accomplished
in
the
face
of
what
seemed
insurmountable
difficulties
besides
he
paused
again
here
and
for
a
longer
time
because
there
came
suddenly
into
his
mind
words
that
had
been
spoken
to
him
long
ago
by
his
mother
with
god
are
possible
yes
miles
he
continued
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
restrain
your
anger
and
indignation
because
it
is
useless
to
give
vent
to
them
that
but
a
low
motive
after
all
is
it
worthy
of
an
intelligent
man
i
get
a
slap
in
the
face
and
bear
it
patiently
because
i
ca
help
myself
i
get
the
same
slap
in
the
face
in
circumstances
where
i
help
myself
and
i
resent
it
fiercely
humble
when
i
be
so
fierce
when
i
got
the
power

not
this
unmanly
childish
humbug
there
is
no
principle
here
principle
i
do
believe
i
never
had
any
principle
in
me
worthy
of
the
name
i
have
been
drifting
up
to
this
time
before
the
winds
of
caprice
and
selfish
inclination
a
long
pause
here
well
it
just
comes
to
this
that
whatever
happens
i
must
submit
with
a
good
grace
at
least
as
good
grace
as
i
can
and
hope
that
an
opportunity
to
escape
may
occur
before
long
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
do
it
and
when
i
once
make
up
my
mind
i
he
paused
once
more
at
this
point
and
the
pause
was
so
long
that
he
turned
it
into
a
full
stop
by
laying
his
head
on
the
block
of
wood
which
formed
his
pillow
and
going
to
sleep
it
will
be
seen
from
the
above
candid
remarks
that
our
hero
was
not
quite
as
confident
of
his
power
of
will
as
he
used
to
be
also
that
he
was
learning
a
few
useful
facts
in
the
school
of
adversity
one
evening
after
a
harder
day
than
usual
miles
was
conducted
to
the
prison
in
which
he
and
his
companions
had
been
confined
on
the
day
of
their
arrival
looking
round
the
cell
he
observed
on
becoming
accustomed
to
the
dim
light
that
only
one
other
prisoner
was
there
he
was
lying
on
the
bare
ground
in
a
corner
coiled
up
like
a
dog
and
with
his
face
to
the
wall
relieved
to
find
that
he
was
not
to
be
altogether
alone
miles
sat
down
with
his
back
against
the
opposite
wall
and
awaited
the
waking
of
his
companion
with
some
interest
for
although
his
face
was
not
visible
and
his
body
was
clothed
in
a
sort
of
sacking
his
neck
and
lower
limbs
showed
that
he
was
a
white
man
but
the
sleeper
did
not
seem
inclined
to
waken
just
then
on
the
contrary
he
began
ere
long
to
snore
heavily
miles
gradually
fell
into
a
train
of
thought
that
seemed
to
bring
back
reminiscences
of
a
vague
indefinable
sort
then
he
suddenly
became
aware
that
the
snore
of
the
snorer
was
not
unfamiliar
he
was
on
the
point
of
rising
to
investigate
this
when
the
sleeper
awoke
with
a
start
sat
bolt
upright
with
a
look
of
owlish
gravity
and
presented
the
features
of
jack
molloy
miles
my
lad
cried
jack
springing
up
to
greet
his
friend
warmly
i
thought
you
was
dead
and
jack
my
dear
friend
returned
miles
i
thought
at
least
i
feared
that
you
must
have
been
tortured
to
death
an
you
was
far
wrong
my
boy
stand
close
to
me
and
look
me
straight
in
the
eyes
think
i
any
taller
not
much
at
least
not
to
my
perception
why
i
wonder
at
that
now
said
molloy
for
i
bin
hanged
three
times
an
should
have
bin
pulled
out
a
bit
by
this
time
considering
my
weight
his
friend
smiled
incredulously
you
may
laugh
lad
but
it
no
laughin
matter
said
molloy
feeling
his
neck
tenderly
the
last
time
i
really
thought
it
was
all
up
me
for
the
knot
somehow
got
agin
my
windpipe
an
i
was
all
but
choked
if
they
had
kep
me
up
half
a
minute
longer
it
would
have
bin
all
over
i
wished
they
had
for
though
i
never
was
much
troubled
wi
the
narves
i
beginnin
now
to
have
a
little
for
the
sufferin
o
the
narvish
do
you
really
mean
my
dear
fellow
that
the
monsters
have
been
torturing
you
in
this
way
asked
miles
with
looks
of
sympathy
ay
john
miles
that
just
what
i
does
mean
returned
the
seaman
with
an
anxious
and
startled
look
at
the
door
on
the
other
side
of
which
a
slight
noise
was
heard
at
the
moment
they
me
three
times
already
the
last
time
was
only
yesterday
an
at
any
moment
they
may
come
to
give
me
another
turn
it
the
uncertainty
the
thing
that
tries
my
narves
i
used
to
boast
that
i
had
got
none
once
but
the
arabs
know
how
to
take
the
boastin
out
of
a
fellow
if
they
only
take
me
out
to
be
hanged
right
off
an
done
with
it
i
would
mind
it
so
much
but
it
the
constant
of
uncertainty
that
floors
me
i
ai
quite
floored
yet
but
let
hear
about
yourself
miles
come
sit
down
i
gets
tired
sooner
than
i
used
to
do
since
they
took
to
hangin
me
how
have
they
bin
sarvin
you
out
since
i
last
saw
ye
not
near
so
badly
as
they
have
been
serving
you
old
boy
said
miles
as
he
sat
down
and
began
to
detail
his
own
experiences
but
tell
me
he
added
have
you
heard
anything
of
our
unfortunate
comrades
since
we
parted
nothing
at
least
nothing
that
i
can
trust
to
i
did
hear
that
poor
moses
pyne
is
dead
that
they
had
treated
him
the
same
as
me
and
that
his
narves
could
stand
it
that
he
broke
down
under
the
strain
died
but
i
do
believe
it
not
that
these
arabs
would
kill
him
that
way
but
the
interpreter
who
told
me
has
got
falsehood
so
plainly
writ
in
his
ugly
face
that
i
would
fain
hope
our
friend
is
yet
alive
god
grant
it
may
be
so
said
miles
fervently
and
i
scarcely
think
that
even
the
cruellest
of
men
would
persevere
in
torturing
such
a
gentle
fellow
as
moses
you
right
returned
molloy
anyhow
we
take
what
comfort
we
can
out
o
the
hope
talkin
o
comfort
what
think
has
bin
comfortin
me
in
a
most
wonderful
way
you
never
guess
what
is
it
then
one
o
them
little
books
as
miss
robinson
writes
and
gives
to
soldiers
and
sailors
victory
it
called
havin
a
good
deal
in
it
about
nelson
flagship
and
nelson
himself
but
there
a
deal
more
than
that
in
it
words
that
has
gone
straight
to
my
heart
and
made
me
see
love
in
christ
as
i
never
saw
it
before
our
comrade
stevenson
gave
it
to
me
before
we
was
nabbed
by
the
arabs
an
i
kep
it
in
the
o
my
straw
hat
ever
since
you
see
it
a
thin
little
thing
though
there
oceans
o
truth
in
it
an
it
easy
stowed
away
i
forgot
all
about
it
till
i
was
left
alone
in
this
place
and
then
i
got
it
out
an
god
in
his
marcy
made
it
like
a
light
in
the
dark
to
me
stevenson
came
by
it
in
a
strange
way
he
told
me
he
was
goin
over
a
after
a
scrimmage
near
suakim
lookin
out
for
the
wounded
when
he
noticed
somethin
clasped
in
a
dead
man
hand
the
hand
gripped
it
tight
as
if
unwillin
to
part
with
it
an
when
stevenson
got
it
he
found
that
it
was
this
little
book
victory
here
it
is
i
would
change
it
for
a
golden
sov
to
every
page
as
he
spoke
footsteps
were
heard
approaching
the
door
with
a
startled
air
molloy
thrust
the
book
into
its
place
and
sprang
up
see
there
now
he
said
remonstratively
who
ever
ha
thowt
that
i
come
to
jerk
about
like
that
before
the
door
opened
however
the
momentary
weakness
had
passed
away
and
our
seaman
stood
upright
with
stern
brow
and
compressed
lips
presenting
to
those
who
entered
as
firm
and
a
man
of
courage
as
one
could
wish
to
see
i
knowed
it
he
said
in
a
quiet
voice
to
his
friend
as
two
strong
armed
men
advanced
and
seized
him
while
two
with
drawn
swords
stood
behind
him
at
the
same
time
two
others
stood
guard
over
miles
they
goin
to
give
me
another
turn
god
grant
that
it
may
be
the
last
yes
de
last
you
be
surely
dead
dis
time
said
the
interpreter
with
a
malignant
smile
if
had
said
it
i
would
have
had
some
hope
that
the
end
was
come
said
molloy
as
they
put
a
rope
round
his
neck
and
led
him
away
miles
he
added
looking
over
his
shoulder
if
i
never
come
back
an
you
ever
gets
home
again
give
my
kind
regards
to
miss
robinson
god
bless
her
next
moment
the
door
closed
and
miles
was
left
alone
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
state
of
mind
in
which
our
hero
paced
his
cell
during
the
next
hour
the
intense
pity
mingled
with
anxiety
and
fierce
indignation
that
burned
in
his
bosom
were
almost
unbearable
oh
he
thought
if
i
were
only
once
more
free
for
one
moment
with
a
weapon
in
my
hand
i
he
wisely
checked
himself
in
the
train
of
useless
thought
at
this
point
then
he
sat
down
on
the
floor
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
tried
to
pray
but
could
not
starting
up
he
again
paced
wildly
about
the
cell
like
a
caged
tiger
after
what
seemed
to
him
an
age
he
heard
footsteps
in
the
outer
court
the
door
opened
and
the
sailor
was
thrust
in
staggering
forward
a
step
or
two
he
was
on
the
point
of
falling
when
miles
caught
him
in
his
arms
and
let
him
sink
gently
on
the
ground
and
sitting
down
beside
him
laid
his
head
upon
his
knee
from
the
inflamed
red
mark
which
encircled
the
seaman
powerful
neck
it
was
obvious
enough
that
the
cruel
monsters
had
again
put
him
to
the
tremendous
mental
agony
of
supposing
that
his
last
hour
had
come
help
me
up
lad
and
set
my
back
agin
the
wall
he
said
in
a
low
voice
as
miles
complied
one
or
two
tears
that
would
not
be
repressed
fell
from
his
eyes
on
the
sailor
cheek
you
a
good
fellow
said
molloy
looking
up
i
thank
the
lord
for
sendin
you
to
comfort
me
and
i
need
comfort
a
bit
just
now
know
there
i
better
an
i
be
upside
wi
them
next
time
for
i
feels
somehow
that
i
could
stand
another
turn
poor
moses
i
do
hope
that
the
interpreter
is
the
liar
he
looks
and
that
they
have
treated
the
poor
fellow
to
this
sort
o
thing
even
while
he
spoke
the
door
of
the
cell
again
opened
and
armed
men
entered
ay
here
you
are
cried
the
sailor
rising
quickly
and
attempting
to
draw
himself
up
and
show
a
bold
front
come
away
an
welcome
ready
for
but
the
men
had
not
come
for
molloy
they
wanted
miles
over
whom
there
came
a
sudden
and
dreadful
feeling
of
horror
as
he
thought
they
were
perhaps
going
to
subject
him
to
the
same
ordeal
as
his
friend
keep
up
heart
lad
and
trust
in
the
lord
said
the
sailor
in
an
encouraging
tone
as
they
led
our
hero
away
the
words
were
fitly
spoken
and
went
far
to
restore
to
the
poor
youth
the
courage
that
for
a
moment
had
forsaken
him
as
he
emerged
into
the
bright
light
which
dazzled
him
after
the
darkness
of
his
he
thought
of
the
sun
of
righteousness
and
of
the
dear
mother
who
had
sought
so
earnestly
to
lead
him
to
god
in
his
boyhood
one
thing
that
greatly
encouraged
him
was
the
fact
that
no
rope
had
been
put
round
his
neck
as
had
been
done
to
molloy
and
he
also
observed
that
his
guards
did
not
treat
him
roughly
moreover
they
led
him
in
quite
a
different
direction
from
the
open
place
where
he
well
knew
that
criminals
were
executed
he
glanced
at
the
interpreter
who
marched
beside
him
and
thought
for
a
moment
of
asking
him
what
might
be
his
impending
fate
but
the
man
look
was
so
forbidding
that
he
forbore
to
speak
presently
they
stopped
before
a
door
which
was
opened
by
a
negro
slave
and
the
guards
remained
outside
while
miles
and
the
interpreter
entered
the
court
into
which
they
were
ushered
was
open
to
the
sky
and
contained
a
fountain
in
the
centre
with
boxes
of
flowers
and
shrubs
around
it
at
the
inner
end
of
it
stood
a
tall
powerful
arab
leaning
on
a
curved
sword
miles
saw
at
a
glance
that
he
was
the
same
man
whose
life
he
had
saved
and
who
had
come
so
opportunely
to
the
rescue
of
his
friend
molloy
but
the
arab
gave
him
no
sign
of
recognition
on
the
contrary
the
glance
which
he
bestowed
on
him
was
one
of
calm
stern
indifference
ask
him
he
said
at
once
to
the
interpreter
where
are
the
christian
dogs
who
were
captured
with
him
tell
him
replied
miles
when
this
was
translated
that
i
know
nothing
about
the
fate
of
any
of
them
except
one
which
one
is
that
the
sailor
answered
miles
where
is
he
in
the
prison
i
have
just
left
and
you
know
nothing
about
the
others
nothing
whatever
the
arab
seemed
to
ponder
these
replies
for
a
few
minutes
then
turning
to
the
interpreter
he
spoke
in
a
tone
that
seemed
to
miles
to
imply
the
giving
of
some
strict
orders
after
which
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
and
a
majestic
inclination
of
the
head
he
dismissed
them
although
there
was
little
in
the
interview
to
afford
encouragement
miles
nevertheless
was
rendered
much
more
hopeful
by
it
all
the
more
that
he
observed
a
distinct
difference
in
the
bearing
of
the
interpreter
towards
him
as
they
went
out
who
is
that
he
ventured
to
ask
as
he
walked
back
to
the
prison
that
is
mohammed
the
mahdi
cousin
answered
the
interpreter
miles
was
about
to
put
some
more
questions
when
he
was
brought
to
a
sudden
stand
and
rendered
for
the
moment
speechless
by
the
sight
of
moses
pyne
not
bearing
heavy
burdens
or
labouring
in
chains
as
might
have
been
expected
but
standing
in
a
shallow
recess
or
niche
in
the
wall
of
a
house
busily
engaged
over
a
small
brazier
cooking
beans
in
oil
and
selling
the
same
to
the
what
you
see
demanded
the
interpreter
i
see
an
old
friend
and
comrade
may
i
speak
to
him
asked
miles
eagerly
you
may
answered
the
interpreter
the
surprise
and
joy
of
moses
when
his
friend
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
saluted
him
by
name
is
not
easily
described
i
so
glad
to
see
you
old
fellow
he
said
with
sparkling
eyes
i
thought
you
must
be
dead
for
i
tried
so
often
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
you
have
some
beans
and
oil
he
dipped
a
huge
ladleful
out
of
the
pot
as
if
he
were
going
to
administer
a
dose
on
the
spot
no
thank
you
moses
i
a
prisoner
these
are
my
guards
i
wonder
they
have
allowed
me
even
to
exchange
a
word
with
you
must
be
quick
they
told
us
you
had
been
till
you
were
frightened
to
death
they
told
you
lies
then
i
been
very
well
treated
but
what
troubles
me
is
i
ca
find
out
where
any
of
our
comrades
have
gone
to
i
can
tell
only
of
one
molloy
is
alive
i
wish
i
could
say
well
of
the
others
i
as
ignorant
as
yourself
but
i
seen
a
friend
who
at
this
point
he
was
interrupted
by
the
interpreter
and
told
to
move
on
which
he
was
fain
to
do
with
a
cheery
to
moses
and
a
wave
of
the
hand
arrived
at
the
prison
he
found
that
molloy
had
been
removed
to
a
more
comfortable
room
into
which
he
was
also
ushered
and
there
they
were
left
alone
together
feel
better
now
my
poor
fellow
asked
miles
when
the
door
was
shut
better
bless
you
yes
i
feels
far
too
well
they
given
me
a
rare
of
beans
an
oil
since
you
were
taken
off
to
be
hanged
and
i
feels
so
strong
that
the
next
turn
off
wo
finish
me
i
could
never
have
eaten
thinkin
of
you
but
know
i
was
quite
sure
from
the
way
they
treated
you
as
you
went
out
that
it
war
to
be
wi
you
this
time
an
when
they
putt
me
into
this
here
room
produced
the
beans
an
oil
i
began
to
feel
quite
easy
in
my
mind
about
you
it
was
the
man
that
brought
your
marchin
orders
that
told
to
putt
me
here
know
lad
i
ca
help
feelin
that
a
friend
some
sort
must
have
bin
raised
up
to
us
you
right
jack
i
have
just
seen
the
arab
whose
life
i
saved
and
who
saved
yours
it
very
strange
too
that
beans
and
oil
should
have
been
your
fare
for
i
have
also
seen
moses
pyne
in
the
street
not
since
cooking
and
selling
beans
and
oil
you
do
mean
that
indeed
i
do
i
spoken
to
him
sitting
down
on
a
stool
for
they
were
promoted
to
a
furnished
apartment
miles
entered
into
an
elaborate
account
of
all
that
had
befallen
him
since
the
hour
that
he
had
been
taken
out
as
they
both
thought
to
be
hanged
chapter
twenty
seven
in
which
hopes
and
fears
rise
and
fall
there
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
undoubtedly
and
the
tide
in
the
affairs
of
miles
milton
and
his
comrades
appeared
to
have
reached
at
this
time
for
on
the
day
mentioned
in
the
last
chapter
it
began
to
turn
and
continued
for
a
considerable
time
to
rise
the
first
clear
evidence
of
the
change
was
the
of
beans
and
oil
coupled
with
the
change
of
prison
the
next
was
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
himself
why
i
do
believe
it
it
moses
exclaimed
molloy
as
his
old
comrade
entered
the
prison
give
us
your
flipper
man
alive
but
right
glad
to
see
you
we
thought
you
was
let
have
a
look
at
your
neck
no
nothing
there
i
knowed
as
that
interpreter
was
a
liar
but
what
brings
you
lad
what
mischief
have
bin
up
to
that
what
puzzles
myself
jack
said
moses
shaking
hands
warmly
with
miles
i
done
nothing
that
i
know
of
except
sell
beans
and
oil
it
true
i
burned
sometimes
a
bit
but
they
hardly
put
a
fellow
in
jail
for
that
would
they
however
i
glad
they
done
it
whatever
the
reason
seeing
that
it
has
brought
us
three
together
again
but
i
say
continued
moses
while
a
look
of
anxiety
came
over
his
innocent
face
what
can
have
become
of
our
other
comrades
you
may
well
ask
that
lad
i
asked
the
same
question
of
myself
for
many
a
day
but
have
never
bin
able
to
get
from
myself
a
satisfactory
answer
i
wery
much
afeared
that
we
never
see
again
it
seemed
almost
to
be
a
in
the
affairs
of
the
trio
at
that
time
for
while
the
seaman
was
speaking
as
if
to
rebuke
his
want
of
faith
the
door
opened
and
their
comrade
armstrong
walked
in
for
a
few
moments
they
were
all
rendered
speechless
then
miles
sprang
up
seized
his
friend
by
both
shoulders
and
gazed
into
his
face
it
was
a
very
thin
and
careworn
face
at
that
time
as
if
much
of
the
bloom
of
youth
had
been
wiped
from
it
for
ever
willie
am
i
dreaming
exclaimed
miles
if
you
are
so
must
i
be
replied
his
friend
for
when
i
saw
you
last
you
had
not
taken
to
as
a
costume
come
now
retorted
miles
you
have
not
much
to
boast
of
in
that
way
yourself
there
you
are
wrong
miles
for
i
have
to
boast
that
i
made
my
garment
myself
true
it
only
a
sack
but
i
cut
the
hole
in
the
bottom
of
it
for
my
head
with
my
own
hand
and
stitched
on
the
short
sleeves
with
a
but
i
say
what
been
the
matter
with
molloy
have
they
been
working
you
too
hard
jack
no
willum
no
i
ca
exactly
say
that
but
they
bin
hangin
me
too
hard
i
tell
all
about
it
in
coorse
o
time
man
alive
but
they
took
the
flesh
off
your
bones
somehow
let
see
no
your
neck
all
right
must
have
bin
some
other
way
the
way
was
simple
enough
returned
the
other
when
they
separated
us
all
at
first
they
set
me
to
the
hardest
work
they
could
find
to
dig
draw
water
carry
burdens
that
a
horse
might
object
to
sweep
and
clean
up
in
fact
everything
and
anything
and
they
kep
us
hard
at
it
ever
since
i
say
because
rattlin
bill
simkin
was
set
to
help
me
after
the
first
day
an
we
worked
all
along
together
poor
simkin
there
ai
much
rattle
in
him
now
except
his
bones
i
know
why
they
sent
me
here
and
not
him
and
i
ca
well
make
out
whether
i
sent
here
for
extra
punishment
or
as
a
favour
have
you
seen
or
heard
anything
of
stevenson
asked
moses
i
saw
him
once
about
a
week
ago
staggering
under
a
great
log
whether
in
connection
with
or
not
i
ca
tell
it
was
only
for
a
minute
and
i
got
a
tremendous
cut
across
the
back
with
a
cane
for
merely
trying
to
attract
his
attention
the
tide
it
will
be
seen
had
been
rising
pretty
fast
that
afternoon
it
may
be
said
to
have
come
in
with
a
rush
when
towards
evening
the
door
of
their
prison
once
more
opened
and
simkin
with
stevenson
were
ushered
in
together
both
clothed
alike
in
an
extemporised
and
short
drawers
with
this
difference
that
the
one
wore
a
species
of
felt
hat
the
other
a
fez
they
were
still
in
the
midst
of
delighted
surprise
at
the
turn
events
seemed
to
be
taking
when
two
men
entered
bearing
trays
on
which
were
six
smoking
bowls
of
beans
and
oil
hallo
moses
your
business
follows
you
even
to
prison
exclaimed
molloy
true
jack
and
i
follow
my
business
up
returned
moses
sitting
down
on
the
ground
which
formed
their
convenient
table
and
going
to
work
we
need
scarcely
say
that
his
comrades
were
not
slow
to
follow
his
example
the
tide
may
be
said
to
have
reached
at
least
if
not
more
when
on
the
following
morning
the
captives
were
brought
out
and
told
by
the
interpreter
that
they
were
to
accompany
a
body
of
troops
which
were
about
to
quit
the
place
under
the
command
of
mohammed
the
cousin
does
the
mahdi
accompany
us
miles
ventured
to
ask
no
the
mahdi
has
gone
to
khartoum
returned
the
interpreter
who
then
walked
away
as
if
he
objected
to
be
further
questioned
the
hopes
which
had
been
recently
raised
in
the
breasts
of
the
captives
to
a
rather
high
pitch
were
however
somewhat
reduced
when
they
found
that
their
supposed
friend
mohammed
treated
them
with
cool
indifference
did
not
even
recognise
them
and
the
disappointment
was
deepened
still
more
when
all
of
them
except
miles
were
loaded
with
heavy
burdens
and
made
to
march
among
the
as
if
they
were
mere
beasts
of
burden
the
savage
warriors
also
treated
them
with
great
rudeness
and
contempt
miles
soon
found
that
he
was
destined
to
fill
his
old
post
of
runner
in
front
of
mohammed
his
new
master
this
seemed
to
him
unaccountable
for
runners
he
understood
were
required
only
in
towns
and
cities
not
on
a
march
but
the
hardships
attendant
on
the
post
and
the
indignities
to
which
he
was
subjected
at
last
convinced
him
that
the
mahdi
must
have
set
the
mind
of
his
kinsman
against
him
and
that
he
was
now
undergoing
extra
punishment
as
well
as
unique
degradation
the
force
that
took
the
field
on
this
occasion
was
a
very
considerable
one
with
what
precise
object
in
view
was
of
course
unknown
to
all
except
its
chiefs
but
the
fact
that
it
marched
towards
the
frontiers
of
egypt
left
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
any
one
it
was
a
wild
barbaric
host
badly
armed
and
worse
drilled
but
fired
with
a
hatred
of
all
europeans
and
a
burning
sense
of
wrong
what
think
ye
now
miles
asked
armstrong
as
the
captives
sat
grouped
together
in
the
midst
of
the
host
on
the
first
night
of
their
camping
out
in
the
desert
i
think
that
everything
seems
to
be
going
wrong
answered
miles
in
a
desponding
tone
at
first
i
thought
that
mohammed
was
our
friend
but
he
has
treated
me
so
badly
that
i
can
think
so
no
longer
do
you
think
he
may
be
doing
that
to
blind
his
followers
as
to
his
friendship
said
moses
for
myself
i
ca
help
thinkin
he
must
be
grateful
for
what
you
did
miles
i
only
wish
you
had
not
touched
my
rifle
that
day
said
rattling
bill
fiercely
being
fatigued
and
out
of
temper
for
the
blackguard
would
have
bin
in
come
by
this
time
there
gratitude
in
an
arab
i
have
no
hope
at
all
now
my
hope
is
in
god
said
stevenson
well
mate
tells
me
that
that
be
our
best
ground
of
hope
observed
molloy
but
common
experience
tells
me
that
the
almighty
often
lets
his
own
people
come
to
grief
god
lets
come
to
grief
in
the
sense
that
you
mean
returned
the
marine
if
he
kills
his
people
he
takes
them
away
from
the
evil
to
come
and
death
is
but
a
into
glory
if
he
sends
grief
and
suffering
it
is
that
they
may
at
last
reach
a
higher
state
of
joy
pooh
according
to
that
view
can
go
wrong
with
them
that
you
call
his
people
said
simkin
with
contempt
right
you
are
comrade
rejoined
stevenson
can
go
wrong
with
us
can
separate
us
from
the
love
of
god
which
is
in
christ
jesus
our
lord
and
may
be
one
of
this
minute
if
you
will
accept
god
offer
of
free
salvation
in
christ
silence
followed
for
simkin
was
too
angry
as
well
as
worn
out
to
give
his
mind
seriously
to
anything
at
that
time
and
the
others
were
more
or
less
uncertain
as
to
the
truth
of
what
was
advanced
sleep
profound
and
dreamless
soon
banished
these
and
all
other
subjects
from
their
minds
blessed
sleep
so
aptly
as
well
as
beautifully
styled
tired
nature
sweet
restorer
that
great
host
of
dusky
warriors
some
unquestionably
devout
many
cruel
and
relentless
not
a
few
probably
indifferent
to
everything
except
self
and
all
bent
on
the
extermination
of
their
foes
lay
down
beside
their
weapons
and
shared
in
that
rest
which
is
sent
alike
to
the
just
and
to
the
unjust
through
the
grand
impartiality
forbearance
and
love
of
a
god
whom
many
people
apparently
believe
to
be
a
respecter
of
persons
a
few
days
later
the
little
army
came
to
the
edge
of
a
range
of
hills
beyond
which
lay
the
plains
of
the
vast
nubian
desert
at
night
they
encamped
at
the
base
of
the
through
which
they
had
been
travelling
and
the
captives
were
directed
to
take
up
their
position
in
front
of
an
old
ruined
hut
where
masses
of
broken
stones
and
rubbish
made
the
ground
unsuitable
for
camping
on
just
like
them
growled
simkin
looking
about
for
a
fairly
level
spot
there
not
a
place
big
enough
for
a
dog
to
lie
on
supper
made
rattling
bill
a
little
more
amiable
though
not
much
more
forgiving
to
his
foes
a
moon
soon
afterwards
shed
a
faint
light
on
the
host
which
except
the
sentries
was
sound
asleep
towards
midnight
a
solitary
figure
moved
slowly
towards
the
place
where
the
captives
lay
and
awakened
miles
who
sat
up
stared
winked
and
rubbed
his
eyes
two
or
three
times
before
he
could
bring
himself
to
believe
that
his
visitor
was
no
other
than
the
chief
of
the
host
mohammed
rise
com
i
speak
small
engleesh
miles
rose
at
once
and
followed
the
chief
into
the
ruined
hut
clear
de
ground
he
said
pointing
to
the
centre
of
the
floor
our
hero
obeyed
and
when
the
loose
rubbish
was
cleared
away
the
moonbeams
shining
through
the
ruined
roof
fell
on
a
ring
bolt
being
ordered
to
pull
it
he
raised
a
cover
or
and
discovered
beneath
what
appeared
to
be
a
cellar
now
said
mohammed
listen
you
an
friends
go
down
all
i
shut
door
and
cover
up
rubsh
when
we
all
go
com
out
and
go
home
see
yonder
is
he
pointed
to
the
where
a
glowing
star
seemed
to
hang
over
the
margin
of
the
great
level
desert
you
are
generous
you
are
kind
exclaimed
miles
with
a
burst
of
enthusiasm
me
grateful
said
mohammed
extending
his
hand
in
european
fashion
which
miles
grasped
warmly
go
wake
you
comerads
tell
what
me
say
and
com
quick
miles
was
much
too
a
soldier
to
hesitate
though
he
would
have
liked
much
to
suggest
that
some
of
the
troops
might
before
starting
take
a
fancy
to
explore
the
ruin
and
to
ask
how
long
they
should
remain
in
the
cellar
before
venturing
out
quietly
awaking
all
his
comrades
and
drawing
their
surprised
heads
together
he
whispered
his
tale
in
their
wondering
ears
after
that
they
were
quite
prepared
to
act
and
accompanied
him
noiselessly
into
the
ruin
is
the
cellar
deep
asked
miles
as
he
was
about
to
descend
no
not
deep
but
what
about
grub
whittles
meat
an
water
you
know
said
molloy
with
difficulty
accommodating
his
words
to
a
foreigner
we
starve
if
we
go
adrift
on
the
desert
with
nothin
to
eat
or
drink
here
food
said
mohammed
unslinging
a
haversack
from
his
shoulders
and
transferring
it
to
those
of
the
sailor
stop
there
he
continued
pointing
to
the
cellar
till
you
hears
guns
shoot
noise
i
have
make
after
that
silence
then
com
out
an
go
once
again
he
pointed
towards
the
glowing
star
in
the
mohammed
exclaimed
molloy
becoming
suddenly
impressed
with
the
generous
nature
of
the
arab
action
i
do
know
as
you
a
descendant
o
the
prophet
but
i
do
know
that
you
a
brick
give
us
your
flipper
before
we
part
with
a
grave
expression
of
kindliness
and
humour
the
chief
shook
hands
with
the
seaman
then
the
captives
all
descended
into
the
hole
which
was
not
more
than
four
feet
deep
after
which
the
arab
shut
the
trap
covered
it
as
before
with
a
little
rubbish
and
went
away
suppose
he
has
bolted
the
door
suggested
moses
hold
your
tongue
man
and
listen
for
the
signal
said
miles
i
forget
what
he
said
the
signal
was
to
be
observed
simkin
guns
shoot
noise
after
that
silence
said
armstrong
it
a
queer
signal
but
not
difficult
to
recognise
when
we
hear
it
remarked
miles
the
time
seemed
tremendously
long
as
they
sat
there
listening
the
cellar
was
too
low
for
them
to
stand
and
they
began
to
fancy
that
all
kinds
of
horrible
shapes
and
faces
appeared
in
the
intense
darkness
around
them
when
they
listened
intensely
kept
silent
and
held
their
breath
their
hearts
took
to
beating
the
drums
of
their
ears
and
when
a
sudden
breath
or
sigh
escaped
it
seemed
as
if
some
african
monster
were
approaching
from
the
surrounding
gloom
is
that
you
simkin
that
breathin
like
a
grampus
asked
molloy
after
a
long
pause
i
was
just
goin
to
ask
you
to
stop
snorin
retorted
the
soldier
hush
there
a
shot
it
was
indeed
a
distant
shot
followed
immediately
by
several
more
then
a
rattle
of
musketry
followed
nearer
at
hand
instantly
as
if
the
earth
had
just
given
birth
to
them
the
host
of
dusky
warriors
sprang
up
with
yells
of
surprise
and
defiance
and
spear
in
hand
rushed
in
the
direction
of
the
firing
for
a
few
minutes
the
listeners
in
the
cellar
heard
as
it
had
been
a
mighty
torrent
surging
past
the
ruined
hut
gradually
the
force
of
the
rush
began
to
abate
while
the
yells
and
firing
became
more
distant
at
last
all
sounds
ceased
and
the
listeners
were
again
oppressed
by
the
beating
on
the
drums
of
their
ears
they
all
gone
every
mother
son
said
molloy
at
last
breaking
the
oppressive
silence
that
so
said
rattling
bill
up
wi
the
trap
miles
you
under
it
ai
you
i
suffocating
in
this
hole
i
not
under
it
molloy
came
down
last
said
miles
what
if
we
ca
find
it
suggested
stevenson
horrible
said
moses
in
a
hoarse
whisper
and
this
may
be
a
huge
cavern
with
miles
of
space
around
us
instead
of
a
small
cellar
here
it
is
cried
the
sailor
making
a
heave
with
his
broad
back
i
say
it
wo
move
ah
i
was
rightly
under
it
yo
up
went
the
door
with
a
crash
and
the
soft
moonlight
streamed
in
upon
them
a
few
seconds
more
and
they
stood
outside
the
hut
apparently
the
only
living
beings
in
all
that
region
which
had
been
so
full
of
human
life
but
a
few
minutes
before
now
we
must
lose
no
time
in
getting
away
from
this
place
and
covering
as
much
of
the
desert
as
we
can
during
the
night
said
miles
for
it
strikes
me
that
we
have
to
lie
quiet
during
the
day
for
fear
of
being
seen
and
chased
they
spoke
together
in
whispers
for
a
few
minutes
deciding
the
course
they
meant
to
pursue
then
molloy
shouldered
the
provision
bag
miles
grasped
his
official
lance
the
only
weapon
they
had
among
them
and
off
they
set
on
their
journey
across
the
desert
like
a
ship
entering
on
an
unknown
sea
without
the
smallest
idea
of
how
far
they
were
from
the
frontier
of
egypt
and
but
a
vague
notion
of
the
direction
in
which
they
ought
to
go
chapter
twenty
eight
a
horrible
situation
all
that
night
our
fugitives
walked
steadily
in
the
direction
of
their
until
the
dawn
of
day
began
to
absorb
its
light
then
they
selected
a
couple
of
prominent
bushes
on
the
horizon
and
by
keeping
these
always
in
their
relative
positions
were
enabled
to
shape
their
course
in
what
they
believed
to
be
the
right
direction
by
repeating
the
process
continuously
they
were
enabled
to
advance
in
a
fairly
straight
line
molloy
as
we
have
said
carried
the
provision
bag
and
although
it
was
a
very
heavy
one
he
refused
to
let
his
comrades
relieve
him
of
it
until
then
it
was
discovered
that
inside
of
the
large
bag
there
were
rolled
tight
up
four
smaller
bags
with
to
them
a
knowin
feller
that
mohammed
is
said
jack
molloy
as
he
handed
a
bag
to
each
he
understands
how
to
manage
things
let
see
what
sort
o
grub
he
has
i
do
believe
an
dates
or
some
sort
dried
fruit
an
well
that
is
a
comfort
now
then
boys
go
ahead
we
ca
afford
to
waste
time
over
our
meals
the
others
so
thoroughly
agreed
with
their
friend
on
this
point
that
they
began
to
eat
forthwith
almost
in
silence
then
the
provisions
having
been
distributed
they
resumed
their
march
which
was
almost
a
forced
one
so
anxious
were
they
to
get
as
far
away
as
possible
from
the
arab
army
coming
to
a
large
mimosa
bush
in
the
course
of
the
morning
they
halted
and
sat
down
to
rest
a
little
and
hold
what
the
sailor
called
a
palaver
you
see
boys
he
said
it
be
of
no
manner
of
use
our
away
before
the
wind
under
a
press
o
canvas
like
this
without
some
settled
plan
ai
our
plan
to
git
away
from
the
arabs
as
fast
as
we
can
said
moses
pyne
who
sat
on
a
stone
at
the
sailor
feet
yes
moses
but
that
only
part
of
it
returned
molloy
we
must
keep
away
as
well
as
get
away
an
that
wo
be
quite
so
easy
for
the
country
is
swarmin
wi
the
rascals
as
the
many
tracks
we
have
already
passed
shows
us
if
we
was
to
fall
in
wi
a
band
of
even
a
small
one
we
would
be
took
again
for
sartin
for
we
got
nothin
to
fight
wi
but
our
fists
these
would
offer
but
poor
resistance
to
bullet
and
steel
said
armstrong
and
that
lance
you
so
fond
of
miles
would
be
worth
much
not
much
admitted
miles
surveying
the
badge
of
his
late
office
but
better
than
nothing
what
if
the
arabs
should
change
their
course
and
fall
in
with
us
again
asked
moses
no
fear
o
that
seein
that
mohammed
himself
gave
us
our
orders
an
laid
our
course
for
us
but
it
would
never
do
to
fall
in
other
bands
so
i
proposes
that
we
cast
anchor
where
we
are
for
pretty
good
holdin
ground
among
them
bushes
keep
quiet
all
day
travel
only
at
night
i
got
the
krect
bearin
just
now
so
the
stars
come
out
we
be
able
to
fix
on
one
layin
in
the
right
direction
and
clap
on
all
sail
slow
and
aloft
an
all
the
rest
on
it
a
good
plan
jack
said
armstrong
but
what
if
it
should
come
cloudy
and
blot
out
the
stars
besides
added
miles
you
forget
that
men
of
the
desert
are
skilled
in
observing
signs
and
in
following
tracks
should
any
of
them
pass
near
this
little
clump
of
bushes
and
observe
our
footsteps
going
towards
it
they
will
at
once
come
to
see
if
we
are
still
here
molloy
put
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
perplexed
for
a
moment
never
mind
let
come
he
said
with
a
sudden
look
of
sagacity
we
circumwent
there
nothin
like
circumwention
got
into
a
fix
see
here
we
dig
a
hole
in
a
sandbank
big
enough
to
hold
us
all
an
we
cut
a
big
bush
an
stick
it
in
front
of
the
hole
so
as
they
never
see
it
we
can
keep
a
bright
you
know
an
if
anything
heaves
in
sight
on
the
horizon
down
we
go
into
the
hole
stick
up
the
bush
an
there
you
are
all
safe
under
hatches
till
the
enemy
clears
off
but
they
will
trace
our
footsteps
up
to
the
hole
or
the
bush
said
miles
and
wonder
why
they
can
trace
them
no
further
what
then
again
the
seaman
fell
into
perplexed
meditation
out
of
which
he
emerged
with
a
beaming
smile
why
then
my
lad
we
bamboozle
there
nothin
like
bamboozlement
circumwention
fails
putt
the
two
together
they
like
a
hurricane
in
the
tropics
carries
all
before
it
bamboozle
by
runnin
for
an
hour
or
two
all
over
the
place
so
as
no
mortal
man
seein
our
footprints
will
be
able
to
tell
where
we
comed
from
or
what
we
bin
of
you
do
know
the
men
of
the
desert
jack
rejoined
miles
with
a
laugh
they
just
walk
in
a
circle
round
the
place
where
you
propose
to
run
about
and
bamboozle
them
till
they
found
where
our
tracks
this
bit
of
bush
then
as
they
see
no
tracks
it
of
course
they
know
that
we
were
still
there
see
that
a
puzzler
for
you
jack
remarked
moses
as
he
watched
the
perplexed
expression
looming
up
again
like
a
cloud
on
the
sailor
face
by
no
manner
o
means
retorted
molloy
with
sudden
gravity
i
sees
my
way
quite
clear
out
o
that
you
remember
the
broad
track
not
half
a
mile
off
from
where
we
now
sit
yes
made
i
suppose
by
a
pretty
big
band
o
some
sort
crossin
the
desert
said
moses
well
lad
arter
runnin
about
in
the
bush
to
bamboozle
of
as
aforesaid
we
march
back
to
that
track
on
the
as
it
may
be
an
then
do
the
same
on
the
so
to
speak
an
so
lead
to
suppose
we
was
a
small
party
as
broke
off
or
was
sent
off
from
the
main
body
to
reconnoitre
the
bit
o
bush
an
had
rejoined
the
main
body
further
on
that
what
i
call
circumwentin
see
while
this
palaver
was
going
on
stevenson
and
bill
simkin
were
standing
a
short
way
off
taking
observation
of
something
in
the
far
distance
in
a
few
minutes
they
ran
towards
their
comrades
with
the
information
that
a
band
of
men
were
visible
on
the
horizon
moving
they
thought
in
an
opposite
direction
to
their
line
of
march
it
may
be
so
said
miles
after
a
brief
survey
but
we
ca
be
sure
we
must
put
part
of
your
plan
in
force
anyhow
jack
molloy
away
into
the
scrub
all
of
you
and
stoop
as
you
go
in
saying
this
our
hero
almost
unintentionally
took
command
of
the
little
party
which
at
once
tacitly
accorded
him
the
position
leading
them
as
every
leader
ought
he
proceeded
to
the
centre
of
the
clump
of
bushes
where
finding
a
natural
hollow
or
hole
in
the
sand
at
the
root
of
a
mimosa
bush
three
of
them
went
down
on
hands
and
knees
to
scoop
it
out
deeper
while
the
others
cut
branches
with
molloy
using
flat
stones
chips
of
wood
and
hands
as
shovels
they
managed
to
dig
out
a
hole
big
enough
to
conceal
them
all
the
opening
to
which
was
easily
covered
by
a
mass
of
branches
it
is
doubtful
whether
this
ingenious
contrivance
would
have
availed
them
if
men
of
the
desert
had
passed
that
way
but
fortune
favoured
them
the
band
whether
friends
or
foes
passed
far
off
to
the
westward
leaving
them
to
enjoy
their
place
of
fancied
security
to
pass
the
first
day
there
was
not
difficult
the
novelty
of
the
position
was
great
the
interest
of
the
thing
immense
indefinite
hopes
of
the
future
were
strong
and
they
had
plenty
to
say
and
speculate
about
during
the
passing
hours
when
night
came
preparation
was
made
for
departure
the
provision
bags
were
slung
a
moderate
sip
of
water
indulged
in
and
they
set
forth
after
a
very
brief
prayer
by
stevenson
that
god
would
guide
them
safely
on
their
way
there
was
no
formality
in
that
prayer
the
marine
did
not
ask
his
comrades
to
kneel
or
to
agree
with
him
he
offered
it
aloud
in
a
few
seconds
in
the
name
of
jesus
leaving
his
hearers
to
join
him
or
not
as
they
pleased
see
that
you
lay
your
course
fair
now
molloy
said
miles
as
they
sallied
out
upon
the
darkening
plain
trust
me
lad
i
taken
my
bearin
it
was
very
dark
the
first
part
of
the
night
as
the
moon
did
not
rise
till
late
but
there
was
quite
enough
light
to
enable
them
to
proceed
with
caution
though
not
enough
to
prevent
their
taking
an
occasional
bush
or
stump
for
an
advancing
foe
all
went
well
however
until
dawn
the
following
morning
when
they
began
to
look
about
for
a
suitable
clump
of
bushes
in
which
to
conceal
themselves
no
such
spot
could
they
find
never
mind
lads
said
the
inexhaustible
molloy
we
just
go
on
till
we
find
a
place
we
pretty
tough
just
now
that
one
comfort
they
were
indeed
so
tough
that
they
went
the
whole
of
that
day
with
only
one
or
two
brief
halts
to
feed
towards
evening
however
they
began
to
feel
wearied
and
with
one
consent
determined
to
encamp
on
a
slight
eminence
a
short
way
in
advance
the
sides
of
which
were
covered
with
low
scrub
as
they
approached
the
spot
an
unpleasant
odour
reached
them
it
became
worse
as
they
advanced
at
last
on
arriving
they
found
to
their
surprise
and
horror
that
the
spot
had
been
a
recent
and
was
strewn
with
corpses
and
broken
weapons
some
days
must
have
elapsed
since
the
fight
which
strewed
them
there
for
the
bodies
had
been
all
stripped
and
many
of
them
were
partially
buried
while
others
had
been
hauled
half
out
of
their
graves
by
those
scavengers
of
the
desert
hyenas
and
vultures
impossible
to
halt
here
said
armstrong
i
never
witness
a
sight
like
this
that
it
does
not
force
on
me
the
madness
of
warfare
what
territorial
gain
can
make
up
for
these
lost
lives
the
flower
of
the
manhood
of
both
parties
but
what
are
we
to
do
objected
molloy
men
must
defend
their
rights
not
necessarily
so
said
stevenson
men
have
to
learn
to
bear
and
forbear
i
have
learned
to
take
advantage
of
what
luck
throws
in
my
way
said
rattling
bill
picking
up
a
rifle
which
must
have
escaped
the
observation
of
the
plunderers
who
had
followed
the
army
the
body
of
the
poor
fellow
who
had
owned
it
was
found
concealed
under
a
bush
not
far
off
he
was
an
english
soldier
and
a
very
brief
inspection
showed
that
the
battle
had
been
fought
by
a
party
of
british
and
egyptian
troops
against
the
soudanese
it
seemed
as
if
the
plunderers
had
on
this
occasion
been
scared
from
their
horrible
work
before
completing
it
for
after
a
careful
search
they
found
rifles
with
bayonets
and
pouches
full
of
ammunition
more
than
sufficient
to
arm
the
whole
party
there
are
uniforms
enough
too
to
fit
us
all
out
said
simkin
as
they
were
about
to
leave
the
scene
of
slaughter
no
dead
men
for
me
said
moses
pyne
with
a
shrug
of
disgust
jack
molloy
declared
that
he
had
become
so
used
to
loose
cotton
drawers
and
an
sack
that
for
his
part
he
had
no
desire
to
go
back
to
civilised
costume
and
as
the
rest
were
of
much
the
same
opinion
no
change
was
made
in
the
habiliments
of
the
party
except
that
each
appropriated
a
pair
of
boots
and
miles
exchanged
his
green
tippet
for
a
flannel
shirt
and
a
pith
helmet
he
also
took
a
revolver
with
some
difficulty
from
the
dead
hand
of
a
soldier
and
stuck
it
in
his
belt
thus
improved
in
circumstances
they
gladly
quitted
the
ghastly
scene
and
made
for
a
bushy
hillock
a
few
hundred
yards
in
advance
on
the
way
they
were
arrested
by
the
sound
of
distant
firing
mohammed
must
have
met
our
countrymen
exclaimed
molloy
with
excited
looks
as
they
halted
to
listen
it
may
be
so
but
there
are
other
bands
about
besides
his
said
miles
what
that
a
cheer
ay
a
british
cheer
in
the
far
distance
replied
to
by
yells
of
defiance
molloy
echoed
the
cheer
in
spite
of
his
better
judgment
let
run
an
jine
he
exclaimed
come
along
then
cried
miles
with
the
ardour
of
inexperienced
youth
stop
are
ye
mad
cried
stevenson
do
it
stand
to
reason
that
the
enemy
must
be
between
us
an
suakim
and
that
the
same
as
they
between
us
an
our
friends
moreover
the
cheerin
proves
that
our
side
must
be
gettin
the
best
of
it
an
are
drivin
the
enemy
this
way
so
all
we
got
to
do
is
to
hide
on
that
hillock
an
bide
our
time
right
you
are
comrade
cried
rattling
bill
examining
his
cartridges
and
asserting
with
an
oath
that
nothing
would
afford
him
greater
pleasure
than
a
good
fight
with
the
black
and
something
worse
scoundrels
do
swear
at
your
enemies
simkin
said
the
marine
quietly
but
when
you
get
the
chance
fire
low
agreeing
with
stevenson
advice
to
bide
their
time
the
little
band
was
soon
on
the
top
of
the
hillock
and
took
up
the
best
position
for
defending
the
place
also
for
observing
the
fight
which
they
could
now
see
was
drawing
gradually
nearer
to
them
they
were
not
kept
waiting
long
for
the
natives
were
in
full
flight
hotly
pursued
by
the
english
and
indian
cavalry
a
slight
breeze
blowing
from
the
north
carried
not
only
the
noise
but
soon
the
smoke
of
the
combat
towards
them
as
they
drew
nearer
a
large
detachment
of
native
spearmen
was
seen
to
make
for
the
hillock
evidently
intending
to
make
a
stand
there
now
comes
turn
said
armstrong
examining
the
lock
of
his
rifle
to
see
that
all
was
right
expec
every
man
etceterer
said
molloy
with
a
glance
at
miles
capting
you
may
as
well
let
us
know
your
plans
so
as
we
may
work
together
miles
was
not
long
in
making
up
his
mind
you
fire
at
first
by
command
he
said
quickly
but
decidedly
then
down
on
your
faces
flat
and
load
after
that
wait
for
orders
when
it
comes
to
the
push
as
it
sure
to
do
at
last
we
stand
back
to
back
and
do
our
best
god
help
us
to
do
it
well
do
hurry
boys
especially
in
square
let
every
shot
tell
he
had
barely
concluded
this
brief
address
when
the
yelling
savages
reached
the
hillock
miles
could
even
see
the
gleaming
of
their
teeth
and
eyes
and
the
blood
of
the
slightly
wounded
coursing
down
their
black
skins
as
they
rushed
panting
towards
the
place
where
he
and
his
little
party
were
crouching
then
he
gave
the
word
ready
present
the
smoke
fire
and
death
to
the
leading
men
which
belched
from
the
bushes
did
not
check
the
rush
for
more
than
a
moment
and
even
that
check
was
the
result
of
surprise
more
than
fear
a
party
of
those
arabs
who
were
armed
with
rifles
instantly
replied
but
the
bullets
passed
harmlessly
over
the
prostrate
men
again
the
voice
of
miles
was
heard
ready
present
and
again
the
leading
men
of
the
enemy
fell
but
the
rushing
host
only
divided
and
swept
round
the
hillock
so
as
to
take
it
on
both
sides
at
once
now
form
square
and
pick
each
man
cried
miles
springing
up
and
standing
back
to
back
with
armstrong
molloy
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
him
and
backed
bill
simkin
while
stevenson
did
the
same
for
moses
pyne
the
bushes
did
not
rise
much
above
their
waists
and
as
the
dusky
host
suddenly
beheld
the
knot
of
men
whose
bristling
bayonets
glistened
in
the
setting
sunshine
and
whose
active
rifles
were
still
dealing
death
among
their
ranks
they
dashed
at
the
with
a
yell
of
mingled
rage
and
surprise
another
moment
and
spearmen
were
dancing
round
the
little
square
like
incarnate
fiends
but
the
white
men
made
no
sound
each
confined
himself
to
two
acts
namely
load
and
fire
and
at
every
shot
a
foremost
savage
fell
until
the
square
became
encircled
with
dead
men
another
moment
and
a
party
of
arab
riflemen
ran
to
the
front
and
took
aim
just
then
a
tremendous
cheer
was
heard
the
defenders
of
the
hillock
made
a
wild
reply
which
was
drowned
in
a
furious
fusillade
the
entire
savage
host
seemed
to
rush
over
the
spot
sweeping
all
before
it
while
smoke
rolled
after
them
as
well
as
lead
and
fire
in
the
midst
of
the
hideous
turmoil
miles
received
a
blow
which
shattered
his
left
wrist
grasping
his
rifle
with
his
right
hand
he
laid
about
him
as
best
he
could
next
moment
a
blow
on
the
head
from
behind
stretched
him
senseless
on
the
ground
the
return
of
our
hero
to
consciousness
revealed
to
him
that
he
was
still
lying
on
the
that
it
was
night
and
that
an
intolerable
weight
oppressed
his
chest
this
last
was
caused
by
a
dead
native
having
fallen
across
him
on
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
corpse
he
made
the
further
discovery
that
nearly
all
his
strength
was
gone
and
that
he
could
scarcely
move
his
right
arm
although
it
was
free
and
as
far
as
he
could
make
out
unwounded
making
a
desperate
effort
he
partially
relieved
himself
and
raising
his
head
tried
to
look
round
his
ears
had
already
told
him
that
near
to
him
wounded
men
were
groaning
away
the
little
of
life
that
remained
to
them
he
now
saw
that
he
was
surrounded
by
heaps
of
dead
men
excepting
the
groans
referred
to
the
night
was
silent
and
the
moon
shone
down
on
hundreds
of
faces
the
bloodless
grey
of
the
black
men
contrasting
strangely
with
the
deadly
pallor
of
the
white
all
quiet
and
passionless
enough
now
here
and
there
the
head
of
a
warrior
resting
peacefully
on
the
bosom
or
shoulder
of
the
foe
who
had
killed
him
a
slight
noise
on
his
right
caused
miles
to
turn
his
head
in
that
direction
where
he
saw
a
wounded
comrade
make
feeble
efforts
to
raise
himself
and
then
fall
back
with
a
deep
groan
in
other
circumstances
our
hero
would
have
sprung
to
his
assistance
but
at
that
moment
he
felt
as
if
absolutely
helpless
indeed
he
was
nearly
so
from
loss
of
blood
he
made
one
or
two
efforts
to
rise
but
the
weight
of
the
dead
man
held
him
down
and
after
a
few
brief
attempts
he
fainted
recovering
again
he
looked
round
attracted
by
the
sound
of
a
struggle
on
his
right
one
of
those
fiends
in
human
form
the
plunderers
of
a
had
in
his
ghoulish
progress
come
across
the
wounded
man
who
lay
close
to
miles
and
the
man
was
resisting
him
the
other
put
a
quick
end
to
the
strife
by
drawing
a
knife
across
the
throat
of
the
poor
fellow
a
horror
of
great
darkness
seemed
to
overwhelm
miles
as
he
saw
the
blood
gush
in
a
deluge
from
the
gaping
wound
he
tried
to
shout
but
as
in
a
nightmare
he
could
neither
speak
nor
move
as
the
murderer
went
on
rifling
his
victim
miles
partially
recovered
from
his
trance
of
horror
and
anxiety
for
his
own
life
nerved
him
to
attempt
action
of
some
sort
he
thought
of
the
revolver
for
the
first
time
at
that
moment
and
the
remembrance
seemed
to
infuse
new
life
into
him
putting
his
right
hand
to
his
belt
he
found
it
there
but
drew
it
with
difficulty
doubting
his
power
to
discharge
it
by
means
of
the
trigger
alone
he
made
a
desperate
effort
and
cocked
it
the
click
made
the
murderer
start
he
raised
himself
and
looked
round
our
hero
shut
his
eyes
and
lay
perfectly
still
supposing
probably
that
he
must
have
been
mistaken
the
man
resumed
his
work
miles
could
have
easily
shot
him
where
he
kneeled
if
he
had
retained
power
to
lift
his
arm
and
take
an
aim
as
it
was
he
had
strength
only
to
retain
the
weapon
in
his
grasp
after
a
short
time
that
seemed
an
age
to
the
helpless
watcher
the
murderer
rose
and
turned
his
attention
to
another
dead
man
but
passing
him
came
towards
miles
whose
spirit
turned
for
one
moment
to
god
in
an
agonising
prayer
for
help
the
help
came
in
the
form
of
revived
courage
calm
cool
firm
seemed
to
overbear
all
other
feelings
he
half
closed
his
eyes
as
the
murderer
approached
and
gently
turned
the
muzzle
of
the
revolver
upwards
he
even
let
the
man
bend
over
him
and
look
close
into
his
face
to
see
if
he
were
dead
then
he
pulled
the
trigger
miles
had
aimed
he
thought
at
the
man
breast
but
the
bullet
entered
under
his
chin
and
went
crashing
into
his
brain
a
gush
of
warm
blood
spouted
over
miles
face
as
the
wretch
plunged
over
him
head
first
and
fell
close
by
his
side
he
did
not
die
at
once
the
nature
of
the
ground
prevented
miles
from
seeing
him
but
he
could
hear
him
gradually
gasp
his
life
away
a
few
minutes
later
and
footsteps
were
heard
ascending
the
hillock
miles
grasped
his
revolver
with
a
hand
that
now
trembled
from
increasing
weakness
but
he
was
by
that
time
unable
to
put
the
weapon
on
full
cock
despair
had
seized
him
when
a
familiar
voice
was
heard
this
way
lads
i
sure
it
was
hereabouts
that
i
saw
the
flash
macleod
gasped
miles
as
the
big
scotsman
was
about
to
pass
losh
me
john
miles
is
that
you
are
ye
leevin
scarcely
was
all
that
the
poor
youth
could
utter
ere
he
became
again
insensible
a
fatigue
party
tramped
up
with
a
stretcher
at
the
moment
macleod
with
a
handkerchief
checked
the
ebbing
tide
of
life
and
they
bore
away
from
the
bloody
field
what
seemed
little
more
than
the
mortal
remains
of
poor
miles
milton
chapter
twenty
nine
describes
a
few
meetings
and
several
surprises
the
fight
described
in
the
last
chapter
was
only
one
of
the
numerous
skirmishes
that
were
taking
place
almost
daily
near
suakim
at
that
time
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
serious
occasion
to
our
hero
for
it
cost
him
one
of
his
hands
and
put
an
end
to
his
soldiering
days
for
ever
on
being
taken
to
the
british
lines
the
surgeons
saw
at
once
that
amputation
a
little
above
the
wrist
was
absolutely
necessary
of
course
miles
although
overwhelmed
with
dismay
on
hearing
the
fiat
of
the
doctors
could
offer
no
objection
with
the
informal
celerity
of
surgical
operations
as
practised
in
the
field
the
shattered
limb
was
removed
and
almost
before
he
could
realise
the
full
significance
of
what
was
being
done
our
poor
hero
was
his
left
hand
besides
this
he
was
so
cut
and
battered
about
that
most
of
his
hair
had
to
be
cut
off
and
his
head
bandaged
and
plastered
so
that
those
of
his
old
comrades
who
chanced
to
be
with
the
troops
at
the
time
could
recognise
him
only
by
his
voice
even
that
was
scarcely
audible
when
he
was
carried
into
suakim
at
this
time
the
hospitals
at
suakim
were
overcrowded
to
such
an
extent
that
many
of
the
wounded
and
invalids
had
to
be
sent
on
by
sea
to
suez
and
the
hospitals
at
ramleh
miles
was
sent
on
along
with
these
and
finally
found
rest
at
alexandria
and
great
was
the
poor
fellow
need
of
rest
for
besides
the
terrible
sufferings
and
hardships
he
had
endured
while
in
captivity
the
wounds
and
bruises
the
loss
of
blood
and
of
his
left
hand
and
the
fatigue
of
the
voyage
his
mind
was
overwhelmed
by
the
consideration
that
even
if
he
should
recover
he
was
seriously
maimed
for
life
in
addition
to
all
this
suffering
miles
while
at
suakim
had
received
a
blow
which
killed
him
a
letter
came
informing
him
of
the
sudden
death
of
his
father
and
bitter
remorse
was
added
to
his
misery
as
he
lay
helpless
in
his
cot
on
the
red
sea
the
consequent
depression
acting
on
his
already
exhausted
powers
after
he
reached
alexandria
brought
him
to
the
verge
of
the
grave
indeed
one
of
the
nurses
said
one
day
to
one
of
her
fellows
with
a
shake
of
her
head
ah
poor
fellow
he
wo
last
long
wo
he
thought
miles
with
a
feeling
of
strong
indignation
much
know
about
it
you
see
miles
possessed
a
tendency
to
abstract
reasoning
and
could
meditate
upon
his
own
case
without
so
to
speak
much
reference
to
himself
his
indignation
was
roused
by
the
fact
that
any
one
calling
herself
a
nurse
should
be
so
stupid
as
to
whisper
beside
a
patient
words
that
he
should
not
hear
he
did
not
know
that
the
nurse
in
question
was
a
new
one
not
thoroughly
alive
to
her
duties
and
responsibilities
strange
to
say
her
stupidity
helped
to
render
her
own
prophecy
incorrect
for
the
indignation
quickened
the
feeble
pulse
and
that
gave
him
a
fillip
in
the
right
direction
the
prostration
however
was
very
great
and
for
some
time
the
life
of
our
hero
seemed
to
hang
by
a
thread
during
this
dark
period
the
value
of
a
godly
mother
teaching
became
deeply
impressed
on
him
by
the
fact
that
texts
from
god
word
which
had
been
taught
him
in
childhood
and
which
he
seemed
to
have
quite
forgotten
came
trooping
into
his
mind
and
went
a
long
way
to
calm
and
comfort
him
he
dwelt
with
special
pleasure
on
those
that
told
of
love
and
mercy
in
jesus
to
the
thankless
and
undeserving
for
now
that
strength
health
and
the
high
hopes
of
a
brilliant
career
were
shattered
at
one
blow
his
eyes
were
cleared
of
life
glamour
to
see
that
in
his
existence
hitherto
he
had
been
ungodly
not
in
the
sense
of
his
being
much
worse
than
ordinary
people
but
in
the
sense
of
his
being
quite
indifferent
to
his
maker
and
that
his
fancied
condition
of
would
not
stand
the
test
of
a
dying
hour
about
this
time
too
he
became
desperately
anxious
to
write
to
his
mother
not
by
dictation
but
with
his
own
hand
this
being
impossible
in
the
circumstances
he
began
to
fret
and
his
power
to
sleep
at
length
failed
him
then
a
strange
desire
to
possess
a
rose
seized
him
perhaps
because
he
knew
it
to
be
his
mother
favourite
flower
whatever
the
cause
the
longing
increased
his
insomnia
and
as
he
did
not
say
perhaps
did
not
know
that
the
want
of
a
rose
had
anything
to
do
with
his
complaint
no
one
at
first
thought
of
procuring
one
for
him
he
was
lying
meditating
wakefully
about
many
things
one
day
when
one
of
the
nurses
approached
his
bed
he
did
not
see
her
at
first
because
his
head
was
so
swathed
in
bandages
that
only
one
eye
was
permitted
to
do
duty
and
that
as
molloy
might
have
said
was
on
the
of
his
nose
supposing
the
side
next
the
nurse
to
represent
the
side
i
have
been
laid
up
a
long
time
said
a
lady
who
accompanied
the
nurse
and
have
been
longing
to
resume
my
visits
here
as
one
or
two
patients
whom
i
used
to
nurse
are
still
in
hospital
the
heart
of
miles
gave
a
bound
such
as
it
had
not
attempted
since
the
night
he
witnessed
the
murder
on
the
for
the
voice
was
that
of
mrs
drew
this
is
one
of
our
latest
arrivals
remarked
the
nurse
lowering
her
voice
as
they
advanced
a
poor
young
soldier
lost
a
hand
and
badly
wounded
ca
sleep
he
has
taken
a
strange
longing
of
late
for
a
rose
and
i
have
asked
a
friend
to
fetch
one
for
him
how
lucky
that
we
happen
to
have
one
with
us
said
mrs
drew
looking
back
over
her
shoulder
where
her
daughter
stood
concealed
from
view
by
her
ample
person
marion
dear
will
you
part
with
your
to
a
wounded
soldier
certainly
mother
i
will
give
it
him
myself
she
stepped
quickly
forward
and
looked
sadly
at
the
solitary
glowing
eye
which
gazed
at
her
as
she
unfastened
a
from
her
bosom
it
was
evident
that
she
did
not
recognise
miles
and
no
wonder
for
besides
the
mass
of
bandages
from
out
of
which
his
one
eye
glowed
there
was
a
strip
of
plaster
across
the
bridge
of
his
nose
a
puffy
swelling
in
one
of
the
cheeks
and
the
handsome
mouth
and
chin
were
somewhat
veiled
by
a
rapidly
developing
moustache
and
beard
miles
did
not
speak
he
could
not
speak
he
scarcely
dared
to
breathe
as
the
girl
placed
a
red
in
his
thin
hand
his
trembling
fingers
not
only
took
the
rose
but
the
hand
that
gave
it
and
pressed
it
feebly
to
his
lips
with
a
few
words
of
comfort
and
good
wishes
the
ladies
passed
on
then
miles
drew
the
rose
down
under
the
put
it
to
his
lips
and
with
a
fervently
thankful
mind
fell
into
the
first
profound
slumber
that
he
had
enjoyed
for
many
days
this
was
a
from
that
day
miles
began
to
mend
he
did
not
see
marion
again
for
some
time
for
her
visit
had
been
quite
incidental
but
he
was
satisfied
to
learn
that
she
was
staying
at
the
institute
with
her
mother
assisting
the
workers
there
he
wisely
resolved
to
do
and
say
nothing
at
that
time
but
patiently
to
wait
and
get
well
for
he
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
to
present
himself
to
marion
under
existing
circumstances
would
be
to
say
the
least
injudicious
meanwhile
time
which
waits
for
no
man
passed
on
as
miles
became
stronger
he
began
to
go
about
the
hospital
chatting
with
the
convalescent
patients
and
trying
to
make
himself
generally
useful
on
one
of
these
occasions
he
met
with
a
man
who
gave
him
the
sorrowful
news
that
sergeant
hardy
was
dead
leaving
miles
his
executor
and
residuary
legatee
he
also
learned
to
his
joy
that
his
five
comrades
armstrong
molloy
stevenson
moses
and
simkin
had
escaped
with
their
lives
from
the
fight
on
the
hillock
where
he
fell
and
that
though
all
were
more
or
less
severely
wounded
they
were
doing
well
at
suakim
moreover
continued
his
informant
i
expect
to
hear
more
about
for
the
mail
is
due
and
i
got
a
brother
in
suakim
that
night
not
only
brought
news
of
the
five
heroes
but
also
brought
themselves
for
having
all
been
wounded
at
the
same
time
all
had
been
sent
to
alexandria
together
as
they
were
informed
at
suakim
that
their
comrade
miles
had
been
invalided
home
they
did
not
of
course
make
further
inquiry
about
him
there
while
they
stayed
there
awaiting
the
which
was
to
take
them
home
they
made
miss
robinson
institute
their
constant
rendezvous
for
there
they
not
only
found
all
the
comforts
of
english
life
but
the
joy
of
meeting
with
many
old
comrades
not
a
few
of
whom
were
either
drawn
or
being
drawn
to
god
by
the
influences
of
the
place
it
chanced
that
at
the
time
of
their
arrival
mrs
drew
and
her
daughter
had
gone
to
visit
an
english
family
living
in
the
city
and
did
not
for
several
days
return
to
the
institute
thus
the
invalids
failed
to
meet
their
lady
friends
at
first
but
about
this
time
there
was
announced
a
source
of
attraction
in
the
large
hall
which
brought
them
together
this
attraction
which
unites
all
creeds
and
classes
and
nationalities
in
one
great
bond
of
sympathy
we
need
hardly
say
was
music
a
concert
was
to
take
place
in
the
great
hall
of
the
institute
for
some
local
charity
we
believe
but
are
not
sure
at
which
the
of
alexandria
was
expected
and
the
musical
talent
of
alexandria
was
to
perform
among
others
the
band
of
the
somethingth
regiment
and
let
us
impress
on
you
reader
that
the
band
of
the
somethingth
regiment
was
something
to
be
proud
of
this
brought
numerous
friends
to
the
officers
house
and
great
numbers
of
soldiers
and
to
the
various
rooms
of
the
institute
in
one
of
these
rooms
towards
evening
our
friend
stevenson
was
engaged
at
the
request
of
the
superintendent
in
relating
to
a
number
of
men
a
brief
account
of
the
wonderful
experiences
that
he
and
his
comrades
had
recently
had
in
the
soudan
and
jack
molloy
sat
near
him
emphasising
with
a
nod
of
his
shaggy
head
or
a
right
you
are
messmate
or
a
slap
on
his
thigh
all
the
marine
points
especially
those
in
which
his
friend
passing
over
second
causes
referred
all
their
blessings
and
deliverances
direct
to
his
loving
god
and
father
in
another
room
a
was
going
on
accompanied
by
prayer
and
praise
in
the
larger
rooms
tea
coffee
etcetera
were
being
consumed
to
an
extent
that
no
fellow
can
understand
except
those
who
did
it
games
and
newspapers
and
illustrated
magazines
etcetera
were
rife
elsewhere
while
a
continuous
roar
rather
the
conventional
buzz
of
conversation
was
going
on
everywhere
but
apparently
not
a
single
oath
in
the
midst
of
it
all
the
moral
atmosphere
of
the
place
was
so
pure
that
even
bad
men
respected
perhaps
approved
it
just
before
the
hour
of
the
concert
our
friends
the
five
invalids
sat
grouped
round
a
table
near
the
door
they
were
drinking
tea
and
most
of
them
talking
with
tremendous
animation
for
not
one
of
them
had
been
wounded
in
the
tongue
indeed
it
did
not
appear
that
any
of
them
had
been
very
seriously
wounded
anywhere
while
they
were
yet
in
the
midst
of
their
talk
two
came
down
the
long
room
followed
by
two
other
ladies
in
deep
mourning
the
younger
of
whom
suddenly
sprang
towards
our
quintet
and
clasping
her
hands
stood
speechless
before
them
staring
particularly
at
jack
molloy
who
returned
the
gaze
with
interest
beg

exclaimed
the
sailor
starting
up
in
confusion
and
pulling
his
forelock
but

mr

gasped
marion
grasping
his
hand
and
looking
furtively
round

jack
said
a
seaman
who
was
enjoying
his
coffee
at
a
neighbouring
table
leastwise
i
seed
john
miles
myself
yesterday
in
hospital
wi
my
own
two
eyes
as
is
apt
to
deceive
me
are
ye
sure
o
that
mate
cried
molloy
turning
in
excitement
to
the
man
and
totally
forgetting
marion
mother
let
us
go
out
whispered
the
latter
leaning
heavily
on
mrs
drew
arm
they
passed
out
to
the
verandah
scarcely
observed
owing
to
the
excitement
of
the
quintet
at
the
sailor
news
and
there
she
would
have
fallen
down
if
she
had
not
been
caught
in
the
arms
of
a
soldier
who
was
advancing
towards
the
door
mr
miles
exclaimed
mrs
drew
as
she
looked
up
in
amazement
at
the
scarred
and
worn
face
ay
mrs
drew
through
god
mercy
i
am
here
but
help
me
i
have
not
strength
to
carry
her
marion
had
nearly
fainted
and
was
led
with
the
assistance
of
her
mother
to
a
retired
part
of
the
garden
and
placed
in
an
seeing
that
the
girl
was
recovering
the
other
ladies
judiciously
left
them
and
miles
explained
to
the
mother
while
she
applied
to
marion
that
he
had
come
on
purpose
to
meet
them
hoping
and
expecting
that
they
would
be
attracted
to
the
concert
like
all
the
rest
of
the
world
though
he
had
scarcely
looked
for
so
peculiar
a
meeting
but
how
did
you
know
we
were
here
at
all
asked
mrs
drew
in
surprise
i
saw
you
in
the
hospital
replied
miles
with
a
peculiar
look
your
kind
daughter
gave
me
a
rose
he
pointed
as
he
spoke
to
a
withered
bud
which
was
fastened
to
his
coat
but
but
that
young
man
had
lost
his
hand
the
nurse
told
us
so
exclaimed
mrs
drew
with
a
puzzled
look
miles
silently
pointed
to
the
handless
arm
which
hung
at
his
left
side
marion
had
turned
towards
him
with
a
look
she
now
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
covered
her
face
with
both
hands
mr
miles
said
the
wise
old
lady
with
a
sudden
and
violent
change
of
subject
your
friends
armstrong
and
molloy
are
in
the
institute
at
this
moment
waiting
for
you
our
hero
needed
no
second
hint
next
minute
he
dashed
into
the
entrance
hall
with
wonderful
vigour
for
an
invalid
for
he
heard
the
bass
voice
of
molloy
exclaiming
i
do
care
a
button
leave
or
no
leave
i
make
my
way
to
john
mi
hallo
the
hallo
was
caused
by
his
being
rushed
into
by
the
impetuous
miles
with
such
force
that
they
both
staggered
why
john
you
like
the
ram
of
an
is
it
really
yourself
give
us
your
flipper
my
boy
but
the
flipper
was
already
in
that
of
willie
armstrong
while
the
others
crowded
round
him
with
congratulations
wot
on
airth
all
the
noise
about
in
that
there
corner
exclaimed
a
who
was
trying
hard
to
tell
an
interminable
story
to
a
quiet
shipmate
in
spite
of
the
din
it
only
that
we
diskivered
our
captin
cried
molloy
eager
to
get
any
one
to
sympathise
wot
captin
that
growled
the
why
him
as
led
us
on
the
hillock
to
be
sure
at
suakim
when
acts
of
heroism
and
personal
prowess
are
of
frequent
occurrence
deeds
of
daring
are
not
apt
to
draw
general
attention
unless
they
rise
above
the
average
the
affair
of
the
hillock
however
as
it
got
to
be
called
although
unnoticed
in
despatches
or
the
public
prints
was
among
the
rank
and
file
who
did
the
work
in
those
hot
regions
when
therefore
it
became
known
that
the
six
heroes
who
had
distinguished
themselves
on
that
hillock
were
present
a
great
deal
of
interest
was
exhibited
this
culminated
when
a
little
man
rushed
suddenly
into
the
room
and
with
a
wild
hooroo
seized
molloy
round
the
waist
he
was
tall
enough
to
get
him
comfortably
by
the
neck
and
appeared
to
wrestle
with
him
it
corporal
flynn
or
his
ghost
exclaimed
molloy
sure
an
it
both
him
an
his
ghost
togither
exclaimed
the
corporal
shaking
hands
violently
all
round
i
thought
ye
was
sent
home
said
moses
niver
a
bit
man
they
tell
awful
lies
where
you
come
from
i
would
take
their
consciences
as
a
gift
i
as
well
as
iver
and
better
but
i
goin
home
for
all
that
to
see
me
owld
grandmother
ye
need
laugh
you
spalpeens
come
three
cheers
boys
for
the
o
the
hillock
most
heartily
did
the
men
there
assembled
respond
to
this
call
and
then
the
entire
assembly
cleared
off
to
the
concert
with
the
exception
of
miles
milton
he
as
corporal
flynn
knowingly
observed
had
other
fish
to
fry
he
fried
these
fish
in
company
with
mrs
and
marion
drew
but
as
the
details
of
this
culinary
proceeding
were
related
to
us
in
strict
confidence
we
refuse
to
divulge
them
and
now
draw
the
curtain
down
on
the
ancient
land
of
egypt
chapter
thirty
conclusion
once
more
we
return
to
the
embarkation
jetty
at
portsmouth
there
as
of
old
we
find
a
huge
warping
slowly
in
her
bulwarks
and
ports
crowded
with
white
helmets
and
eager
faces
gazing
at
the
equally
eager
but
anxious
faces
on
shore
miss
robinson
shows
signs
of
life
our
friend
brown
is
stimulating
the
boiler
the
great
solitary
has
been
opened
and
the
are
there
preparing
their
ammunition
and
getting
ready
for
action
for
every
that
comes
to
portsmouth
from
foreign
shores
laden
with
the
bronzed
warriors
of
britain
has
to
face
the
certainty
of
going
into
action
with
that
unconquerable
little
we
do
not
however
mean
to
draw
the
reader
again
through
the
old
scene
further
than
to
point
out
that
among
the
many
faces
that
loom
over
these
bulwarks
five
are
familiar
namely
those
of
our
friends
miles
milton
william
armstrong
moses
pyne
stevenson
and
simkin
jack
molloy
is
not
with
them
because
he
has
preferred
to
remain
in
egypt
believing
himself
to
be
capable
of
still
further
service
to
queen
and
country
a
feeling
of
great
disappointment
oppresses
miles
and
his
friend
armstrong
for
they
fail
to
recognise
in
the
eager
crowd
those
whom
they
had
expected
to
see
my
mother
must
be
ill
muttered
miles
so
must
my
emmy
murmured
his
friend
there
was
a
very
anxious
little
widow
on
the
jetty
who
could
manage
to
distinguish
individuals
in
the
sea
of
brown
faces
and
white
helmets
because
the
tears
in
her
eyes
mixed
them
all
up
most
perplexingly
it
is
not
surprising
that
miles
had
totally
failed
to
recognise
the
mother
of
old
in
the
unfamiliar
widow
weeds
especially
when
it
is
considered
that
his
was
a
shrinking
timid
mother
who
kept
well
in
the
background
of
the
demonstrative
crowd
their
eyes
met
at
last
however
and
those
of
the
widow
opened
wide
with
surprise
at
the
change
in
the
son
while
those
of
the
son
were
suddenly
blinded
with
tears
at
the
change
in
the
mother
then
they
met
and
such
a
meeting
in
the
midst
of
men
and
women
elbowing
crowding
embracing
exclaiming
rejoicing
chaffing
weeping
it
was
an
awkward
state
of
things
but
as
every
one
else
was
in
the
same
predicament
and
as
all
were
more
or
less
swallowed
up
in
their
own
affairs
miles
and
his
mother
were
fain
to
make
the
best
of
it
they
retired
under
the
partial
shelter
of
a
bulkhead
where
and
nautical
debris
interfered
with
their
footing
and
tarry
odours
regaled
their
noses
and
there
in
they
interchanged
their
first
confidences
suddenly
mrs
milton
observed
a
tall
young
fellow
standing
not
far
off
looking
wistfully
at
the
bewildering
scene
apparently
in
deep
dejection
who
is
that
miles
she
asked
why
that
my
comrade
chum
and
friend
whom
i
have
so
often
written
about
willie
armstrong
come
i
will
introduce
you
oh
how
selfish
of
me
cried
the
widow
starting
forward
and
not
waiting
for
the
introduction
mr
armstrong
i
sorry
forgive
me
i
promised
to
let
you
know
that
your
wife
waits
to
meet
you
at
the
soldiers
institute
the
difference
between
darkness
and
light
seemed
to
pass
over
the
soldier
face
then
a
slight
shade
of
anxiety
clouded
it
she
is
not
ill
is
she
no
no
well
said
mrs
milton
with
a
peculiar
smile
but
she
thought
it
wiser
not
to
risk
a
meeting
on
the
jetty
as
the
east
wind
is
sharp
i
so
sorry
i
did
not
tell
you
at
once
but
i
selfishly
thought
only
pray
make
no
apology
madam
interrupted
armstrong
i
so
thankful
that
all
is
well
i
had
begun
to
fear
that
something
must
be
wrong
for
my
emmy
disappoints
me
if
she
thinks
it
wiser
not
to
meet
on
the
jetty
it
wiser
a
crowd
of
men
pushed
between
them
at
this
moment
immediately
after
a
female
shout
was
heard
followed
by
the
words
there
he
is
och
himsilf
the
darlint
mrs
flynn
had
discovered
the
little
corporal
and
her
trooper
son
terence
who
had
come
down
with
her
stood
by
to
see
while
the
two
embraced
drifting
with
a
rather
rapid
tide
of
mingled
human
beings
miles
and
his
mother
soon
found
themselves
stranded
beside
the
retiring
behind
this
they
continued
their
conference
there
disturbed
only
by
wind
and
weather
while
the
distribution
of
hot
coffee
was
going
on
in
front
meanwhile
when
leave
was
obtained
armstrong
made
his
way
to
the
institute
where
the
old
scene
of
bustle
and
hilarity
on
the
arrival
of
a
was
going
on
here
in
a
private
room
he
discovered
emmy
and
the
of
her
not
appearing
on
the
jetty
look
at
him
willie
the
second
cried
the
little
woman
holding
up
a
bundle
of
some
sort
the
soldier
was
staggered
for
a
moment
the
only
infantry
that
had
ever
staggered
him
for
his
wife
had
said
nothing
about
this
bundle
in
her
letters
he
recovered
however
and
striding
across
the
room
embraced
the
wife
and
the
bundle
in
one
tremendous
hug
the
wife
did
not
object
but
the
bundle
did
and
instantly
set
up
a
howl
that
quite
alarmed
the
father
and
was
sweetest
music
in
the
ears
now
tell
me
said
the
little
woman
after
calming
the
baby
and
putting
it
in
a
crib
have
you
brought
miles
milton
home
all
safe
yes
all
right
emmy
and
is
he
married
to
that
dear
girl
you
wrote
about
no
not
yet
of
course
but
are
they
engaged
no
miles
told
me
that
he
would
not
presume
to
ask
her
while
he
had
no
home
to
offer
her
pooh
he
a
goose
he
ought
to
make
sure
of
and
let
the
home
look
after
itself
he
may
lose
her
girls
you
know
are
changeable
giddy
things
i
know
nothing
of
the
sort
emmy
the
young
wife
laughed
and
well
there
is
no
need
to
say
what
else
she
did
about
the
same
time
mrs
milton
and
her
son
were
seated
in
another
private
room
of
the
institute
finishing
off
that
interchange
of
confidences
which
had
begun
in
such
confusion
as
it
happened
they
were
conversing
on
the
same
subject
that
occupied
emmy
and
her
husband
you
have
acted
rightly
miles
said
the
mother
for
it
would
have
been
unfair
and
selfish
to
have
induced
the
poor
girl
to
accept
you
until
you
had
some
prospect
of
a
home
to
give
her
god
will
bless
you
for
doing
and
trusting
to
him
and
now
dear
boy
are
you
prepared
for
bad
news
prepared
for
anything
answered
miles
pressing
his
mother
hand
but
i
hope
the
bad
news
does
not
affect
you
mother
it
does
your
dear
father
died
a
bankrupt
i
shrank
from
telling
you
this
when
you
were
wounded
and
ill
so
you
have
to
begin
again
the
battle
of
life
with
only
one
hand
my
poor
boy
for
the
annuity
i
have
of
twenty
pounds
a
year
will
not
go
far
to
keep
us
both
mrs
milton
tried
to
speak
lightly
on
this
point
by
way
of
breaking
it
to
her
son
but
she
nearly
broke
down
for
she
had
already
begun
to
feel
the
pinch
of
extreme
poverty
and
knew
it
to
be
very
very
different
from
what
people
fancy
the
grave
manner
in
which
her
son
received
this
news
filled
her
with
anxiety
mother
he
said
after
pondering
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
and
taking
her
hand
in
his
while
he
slipped
the
handless
arm
round
her
waist
the
news
is
indeed
serious
but
our
father
whom
you
have
trusted
so
long
will
not
fail
us
now
happily
it
is
my
right
hand
that
has
been
spared
and
wonders
you
know
may
be
wrought
with
a
strong
right
hand
especially
if
assisted
by
a
strong
left
stump
into
which
spoons
forks
hooks
and
all
manner
of
ingenious
contrivances
can
be
fitted
now
cheer
up
little
mother
and
i
tell
you
what
we
will
do
but
first
is
there
left
do
the
creditors
take
everything
all
i
believe
except
some
of
the
furniture
which
has
been
kindly
left
for
us
to
start
afresh
with
but
we
must
quit
the
old
home
next
month
at
least
so
i
am
told
by
my
kind
little
lawyer
who
looks
after
everything
for
understand
nothing
your
mention
of
a
lawyer
reminds
me
mother
that
a
poor
sergeant
who
died
a
short
time
ago
in
egypt
made
me
his
executor
and
as
i
am
painfully
ignorant
of
the
duties
of
an
executor
i
go
and
see
this
little
lawyer
if
you
will
give
me
his
address
leaving
miles
to
consult
his
lawyer
we
will
now
turn
to
a
meeting
a
grand
in
the
great
hall
of
the
institute
that
took
place
a
few
days
after
the
return
of
the
which
brought
our
hero
and
his
friends
to
england
some
telling
incidents
occurred
at
this
fight
which
render
it
worthy
of
notice
first
miss
robinson
herself
presided
and
gave
a
stirring
address
which
if
not
of
much
interest
to
readers
who
did
not
hear
it
was
a
point
of
immense
attraction
to
the
hundreds
of
soldiers
sailors
and
civilians
to
whom
it
was
delivered
for
it
was
full
of
sympathy
and
information
and
humour
and
encouragement
and
above
all
of
the
gospel
everybody
worth
mentioning
was
there
that
is
everybody
connected
with
our
tale
who
was
in
england
at
the
time
miles
and
his
mother
of
course
were
there
and
armstrong
with
emmy
ay
and
with
willie
the
second
too
who
was
pronounced
on
all
hands
to
be
the
born
image
of
his
father
alas
for
his
father
if
that
had
been
true
a
round
piece
of
dough
with
three
holes
punched
in
it
and
a
little
knot
in
the
midst
would
have
borne
as
strong
a
resemblance
to
miles
as
that
baby
did
nevertheless
it
was
a
magnificent
baby
and
good
undeniably
good
for
it
slept
soundly
in
its
little
mother
lap
the
whole
evening
stevenson
was
also
there
you
may
be
sure
and
so
were
moses
and
sutherland
and
rattling
bill
simkin
and
corporal
flynn
with
his
mother
and
terence
the
irish
trooper
who
fraternised
with
johnson
the
english
trooper
who
was
also
home
on
the
though
he
seemed
to
have
a
marvellous
colour
and
appetite
for
a
sick
man
is
that
the
friend
asked
simkin
in
a
whisper
of
a
man
who
stood
near
him
as
a
lady
came
on
the
platform
and
took
the
chair
ay
that
her
answered
the
man
and
the
speaker
was
thomas
tufnell
the
of
the
queen
bays
and
the
present
manager
of
the
institute
ay
that
the
friend
well
i
might
have
guessed
it
returned
simkin
from
the
kindly
way
in
which
she
shook
hands
with
a
lot
of
soldiers
just
now
yes
she
has
shook
hands
with
a
good
many
in
her
day
has
the
friend
returned
the
manager
why
i
remember
on
one
occasion
when
she
was
giving
a
lecture
to
soldiers
and
so
many
men
came
forward
to
shake
hands
with
her
that
as
she
told
me
herself
her
hand
was
stiff
and
swelled
all
night
after
it
but
it
not
so
much
for
what
she
has
done
for
ourselves
that
grateful
to
her
remarked
a
corporal
who
sat
on
simkin
right
as
for
what
she
has
done
for
our
wives
widows
and
children
through
the
and
sailors
wives
aid
lookin
arter
them
when
we
away
fightin
our
country
battles
has
endeared
her
to
us
more
than
anything
else
thus
favourably
predisposed
simkin
was
open
to
good
impressions
that
night
but
indeed
there
was
an
atmosphere
a
spirit
of
in
the
hall
that
night
which
rendered
many
others
besides
simkin
open
to
good
impressions
among
the
civilians
there
was
a
man
named
sloper
who
had
for
some
time
past
been
carefully
fished
for
by
an
enthusiastic
young
whom
he
had
basely
misled
and
swindled
he
had
been
at
last
hooked
by
the
young
played
and
finally
landed
in
the
hall
with
his
captor
beside
him
to
keep
him
there
for
sloper
was
a
slippery
fish
with
much
of
the
eel
in
his
nature
perhaps
the
most
unexpected
visitors
to
the
hall
were
two
ladies
in
mourning
who
had
just
arrived
from
egypt
by
way
of
brindisi
mrs
and
miss
drew
having
occasion
to
pass
through
portsmouth
on
their
way
home
learned
that
there
was
to
be
a
at
the
institute
and
marion
immediately
said
i
should
like
much
to
see
it
however
much
much
was
mrs
drew
said
she
would
like
to
see
it
much
so
away
they
went
and
were
conducted
to
the
front
row
there
miles
saw
them
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
and
his
head
in
confusion
he
quietly
rose
bade
his
wondering
mother
get
up
conducted
her
to
the
front
seat
and
setting
her
down
beside
the
drews
introduced
them
then
sitting
down
beside
marion
he
went
in
for
a
pleasant
evening
and
it
a
pleasant
evening
besides
preliminary
tea
and
buns
there
were
speeches
songs
recitations
etcetera
all
being
received
with
immense
satisfaction
by
a
crowded
house
which
had
not
yet
risen
to
the
unenviable
heights
of
classical
taste
and
as
for
miles
and
marion
nothing
came
amiss
to
them
if
a
singer
had
put
b
flat
in
the
place
of
a
natural
they
would
have
accepted
it
as
quite
natural
if
a
humourist
had
said
the
circle
was
a
square
they
would
have
believed
it
in
a
sense
and
tried
to
square
their
reason
accordingly
but
nothing
is
without
alloy
in
this
life
to
the
surprise
of
miles
and
his
mother
their
kind
little
lawyer
also
made
his
appearance
in
the
hall
more
than
that
he
insisted
by
signs
that
miles
should
go
out
and
speak
with
him
but
miles
was
obdurate
he
was
anchored
and
nothing
but
cutting
the
cable
could
move
him
from
his
anchorage
at
last
the
kind
little
man
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
i
have
a
word
with
you
my
dear
sir
it
is
of
importance
he
said
thus
adjured
miles
unwillingly
cut
the
cable
and
drifted
into
a
passage
my
dear
sir
said
the
little
man
seizing
his
hand
i
congratulate
you
you
very
kind
but
pray
explain
why
i
find
that
you
are
heir
to
a
considerable
fortune
miles
was
somewhat
interested
in
this
and
asked
how
that
well
you
remember
hardy
will
which
you
put
into
my
hands
a
few
days
ago
yes
what
then
ca
be
the
fortune
indeed
it
is
hardy
you
remember
made
you
his
residuary
legatee
i
find
on
inquiry
that
the
old
cousin
you
told
me
about
who
meant
to
leave
all
his
money
to
build
a
hospital
changed
his
mind
at
the
last
and
made
out
a
will
in
favour
of
hardy
who
was
his
only
relative
so
you
see
you
being
hardy
heir
have
come
into
possession
of
something
like
two
thousand
a
year
to
this
miles
replied
by
a
whistle
of
surprise
and
then
said
is
that
all
upon
my
word
sir
said
the
little
lawyer
in
a
blaze
of
astonishment
you
appear
to
take
this
communication
in
a
peculiar
manner
you
mistake
me
returned
miles
with
a
laugh
i
do
mean
that
all
the
fortune
but
that
all
you
have
to
say
it
is
and
to
my
mind
i
have
said
a
good
deal
you
certainly
have
and
believe
me
i
am
not
indifferent
or
unthankful
but
but
the
fact
is
that
at
present
i
am
engaged
and
thank
you
so
saying
miles
shook
the
puzzled
old
gentleman
heartily
by
the
hand
and
hurried
back
to
his
anchorage
in
the
hall
i
done
it
mother
whispered
miles
two
days
thereafter
in
the
privacy
of
the
institute
miles
said
the
startled
lady
with
a
reproachful
look
i
thought
you
said
that
nothing
would
induce
you
circumstances
have
altered
mother
i
have
had
a
long
consultation
with
your
little
lawyer
and
he
has
related
some
interesting
facts
to
me
here
followed
a
detailed
account
of
the
facts
so
you
see
i
went
and
proposed
at
once
not
to
the
lawyer
to
marion
and
was
accepted
well
yes
i
could
hardly
believe
it
at
the
time
i
scarcely
believe
it
now
so
i
going
back
this
afternoon
to
make
quite
sure
i
congratulate
you
my
darling
boy
for
a
good
wife
is
god
best
gift
to
man
how
do
you
know
she
is
good
mother
i
know
it
because
i
know
it
anybody
looking
in
her
face
can
it
and
with
two
thousand
a
year
why
one
thousand
mother
i
thought
you
said
two
my
son
so
i
did
that
is
the
amount
of
the
fortune
left
by
the
eccentric
old
founder
when
poor
hardy
made
out
his
will
he
made
me
residuary
legatee
because
the
trifle
he
had
to
leave
his
kit
etcetera
was
not
worth
dividing
between
me
and
armstrong
if
it
had
been
worth
much
he
would
have
divided
it
it
is
therefore
my
duty
now
to
divide
it
with
my
friend
but
in
our
anxiety
to
tell
you
these
interesting
facts
dear
reader
we
have
run
ahead
of
the
to
detail
all
its
incidents
all
its
bearings
all
its
grand
issues
and
blessed
influences
would
require
a
whole
volume
we
return
to
it
only
to
mention
one
or
two
gratifying
facts
it
was
essentially
a
temperance
that
is
a
a
meeting
and
at
the
end
the
soldiers
friend
earnestly
invited
all
who
felt
so
disposed
to
come
forward
and
sign
the
pledge
at
the
same
time
medals
and
prizes
were
presented
to
those
among
the
civilians
who
had
loyally
kept
their
pledge
intact
for
certain
periods
of
time
on
an
average
over
a
thousand
pledges
a
year
are
taken
at
the
institute
and
we
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
year
we
are
writing
of
must
have
exceeded
the
average
to
judge
from
the
numbers
that
pressed
forward
on
this
particular
night
there
were
soldiers
sailors
and
civilians
men
women
and
children
amongst
the
first
rattling
bill
simkin
walked
to
the
front
his
moral
courage
restored
to
an
equality
with
his
physical
heroism
and
put
down
his
name
so
did
johnson
and
sutherland
the
former
as
timid
before
the
audience
as
he
had
been
plucky
before
the
soudanese
but
walking
erect
nevertheless
as
men
do
when
conscious
that
they
are
in
the
right
the
latter
as
bold
as
brass
as
if
to
defy
the
world
in
arms
to
make
him
ever
again
drink
another
drop
of
anything
stronger
than
tea
moses
pyne
also
put
on
the
blue
although
to
do
him
justice
he
required
no
protection
of
that
sort
and
so
did
corporal
flynn
and
terence
and
their
mother
which
last
if
truth
must
be
told
stood
more
in
need
of
the
pledge
than
her
stout
sons
among
the
civilians
several
noted
personages
were
influenced
in
the
right
direction
chief
among
these
was
sodden
disreputable
sloper
whose
trembling
hand
scrawled
a
hieroglyphic
supposed
to
represent
his
name
which
began
indeed
with
an
s
but
ended
in
a
mysterious
prolongation
and
was
further
rendered
indecipherable
by
a
penitent
tear
which
fell
upon
it
from
the
point
of
his
red
red
nose
some
people
laughed
and
said
that
there
was
no
use
in
getting
sloper
to
put
on
the
that
he
was
an
utterly
demoralised
man
that
he
had
no
strength
of
character
that
no
power
on
earth
could
save
they
were
right
no
power
on
earth
could
save
him
or
them
these
people
forgot
that
it
is
not
the
righteous
but
sinners
who
are
called
to
repentance
time
passed
away
and
wrought
its
wonted
changes
among
other
things
it
brought
back
to
portsmouth
big
burly
jack
molloy
as
hearty
and
vigorous
as
he
was
when
being
in
the
soudan
but
a
leg
poor
jack
a
spent
would
that
it
had
been
spent
in
vain
removed
it
below
the
knee
much
more
promptly
than
it
could
have
been
taken
off
by
the
surgeon
knife
but
what
was
loss
to
the
royal
navy
was
gain
to
portsmouth
for
jack
molloy
came
home
and
devoted
himself
heart
and
soul
to
the
lending
of
a
helping
hand
to
his
in
distress
devoting
his
attentions
chiefly
to
the
region
lying
round
nobbs
lane
and
causing
himself
to
be
adored
principally
by
old
women
and
children
and
there
and
thus
he
probably
works
to
this
day
at
least
some
very
like
him
do
when
not
thus
engaged
he
is
prone
to
take
a
cruise
to
a
certain
rural
district
in
the
south
of
england
where
he
finds
congenial
company
in
two
very
tall
erect
moustached
dignified
gentlemen
who
have
a
tendency
to
keep
step
as
they
walk
one
of
whom
has
lost
his
left
hand
and
who
dwell
in
two
close
together
these
two
gentlemen
have
remarkably
pretty
wives
and
wonderfully
boisterous
children
and
the
uproar
which
these
children
make
when
molloy
comes
to
cast
anchor
among
them
is
stupendous
as
for
the
appearance
of
the
brood
and
of
jack
after
a
spree
among
the
hay
the
word
has
yet
to
be
invented
which
will
correctly
describe
it
the
two
farmers
are
spoken
of
by
the
people
around
as
philanthropists
like
true
philanthropists
whose
is
love
to
god
they
do
not
limit
their
attentions
to
their
own
little
neighbourhood
but
allow
their
sympathies
and
their
benefactions
to
run
riot
round
the
world
wheresoever
there
is
anything
that
is
true
honourable
just
pure
lovely
or
of
good
report
to
be
thought
of
or
done
or
assisted
only
one
of
these
acts
of
sympathy
and
benefaction
we
will
mention
every
christmas
there
is
received
by
miss
robinson
at
the
institute
portsmouth
a
huge
hamper
full
of
old
and
new
garments
of
all
kinds
shoes
boots
gowns
frocks
trousers
shawls
comforters
etcetera
with
the
words
written
inside
the
lid
blessed
are
they
that
consider
the
poor
and
on
the
same
day
come
two
cheques
in
a
letter
we
refuse
for
the
best
of
all
reasons
to
divulge
the
amount
of
those
cheques
but
we
consider
it
no
breach
of
confidence
to
reveal
the
fact
that
the
letter
containing
them
is
signed
by
two
old
and
grateful
blue
lights
