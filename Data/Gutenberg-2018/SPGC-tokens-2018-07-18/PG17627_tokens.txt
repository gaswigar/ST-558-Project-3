dedicatory
letter
my
dear
jack
kirkby
to
whom
can
i
dedicate
this
book
but
to
you
who
were
not
only
the
best
friend
of
the
man
i
have
written
about
but
one
without
whom
the
book
could
not
have
been
written
it
is
to
you
that
i
owe
practically
all
the
materials
necessary
for
the
work
it
was
to
you
that
frank
left
the
greater
part
of
his
diary
such
as
it
was
and
i
hope
i
have
observed
your
instructions
properly
as
regards
the
use
i
have
made
of
it
it
was
you
who
took
such
trouble
to
identify
the
places
he
passed
through
and
it
was
you
above
all
who
gave
me
so
keen
an
impression
of
frank
himself
that
it
seems
to
me
i
must
myself
have
somehow
known
him
intimately
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
never
met
i
think
i
should
say
that
it
is
this
sense
of
intimacy
this
extraordinary
interior
accessibility
so
to
speak
of
frank
that
made
him
as
you
and
i
both
think
about
the
most
lovable
person
we
have
ever
known
they
were
very
extraordinary
changes
that
passed
over
him
of
course
and
i
suppose
we
can
not
improve
even
with
all
our
modern
psychology
upon
the
old
mystical
names
for
such
changes
purgation
illumination
and
union
but
as
theologians
themselves
tell
us
that
mysterious
thing
which
catholics
call
the
grace
of
god
does
not
obliterate
but
rather
emphasizes
and
transfigures
the
natural
characteristics
of
every
man
upon
whom
it
comes
with
power
it
was
the
same
element
in
frank
as
it
seems
to
me
the
same
at
least
that
made
him
do
those
preposterous
things
connected
with
bread
and
butter
and
a
railway
train
that
drove
him
from
cambridge
in
defiance
of
all
and
sweet
reasonableness
that
held
him
still
to
that
deplorable
and
lamentable
journey
with
his
two
traveling
companions
and
that
ultimately
led
him
to
his
death
i
mean
it
was
the
same
kind
of
unreasonable
daring
and
purpose
throughout
though
it
issued
in
very
different
kinds
of
actions
and
was
inspired
by
very
different
motives
well
it
is
not
much
good
discussing
frank
in
public
like
this
the
people
who
are
kind
enough
to
read
his
life
or
rather
the
six
months
of
it
with
which
this
book
deals
must
form
their
own
opinion
of
him
probably
a
good
many
will
think
him
a
fool
i
daresay
he
was
but
i
think
i
like
that
kind
of
folly
other
people
may
think
him
simply
obstinate
and
tiresome
well
i
like
obstinacy
of
that
sort
and
i
do
not
find
him
tiresome
everyone
must
form
their
own
views
and
i
have
a
perfect
right
to
form
mine
which
i
am
glad
to
know
coincide
with
your
own
after
all
you
knew
him
better
than
anyone
else
i
went
to
see
gertie
trustcott
as
you
suggested
but
i
did
get
any
help
from
her
i
think
she
is
the
most
suburban
person
i
have
ever
met
she
could
tell
me
nothing
whatever
new
about
him
she
could
only
corroborate
what
you
yourself
had
told
me
and
what
the
diaries
and
other
papers
contained
i
did
not
stay
long
with
miss
trustcott
and
now
my
dear
friend
i
must
ask
you
to
accept
this
book
from
me
and
to
make
the
best
of
it
of
course
i
have
had
to
conjecture
a
great
deal
and
to
embroider
even
more
but
it
is
no
more
than
embroidery
i
have
not
touched
the
fabric
itself
which
you
put
into
my
hands
and
anyone
who
cares
to
pull
out
the
threads
i
have
inserted
can
do
so
if
they
will
without
any
fear
of
the
thing
falling
to
pieces
i
have
to
thank
you
for
many
pleasurable
and
even
emotional
hours
the
offering
which
i
present
to
you
now
is
the
only
return
i
can
make
i
am
ever
yours
sincerely
robert
hugh
benson
we
paneled
a
new
room
since
you
were
last
at
hare
street
come
and
see
it
soon
and
sleep
in
it
we
want
you
badly
and
i
want
to
talk
a
great
deal
more
about
frank
i
hear
that
her
ladyship
has
gone
back
to
live
with
her
father
she
tried
the
dower
house
in
westmoreland
but
seems
to
have
found
it
lonely
is
that
true
it
be
rather
difficult
for
dick
wo
it
none
other
gods
part
i
chapter
i
i
i
think
you
behaving
like
an
absolute
idiot
said
jack
kirkby
indignantly
frank
grinned
pleasantly
and
added
his
left
foot
to
his
right
one
in
the
broad
these
two
young
men
were
sitting
in
one
of
the
most
pleasant
places
in
all
the
world
in
which
to
sit
on
a
summer
evening
in
a
room
looking
out
upon
the
great
court
of
trinity
college
cambridge
it
was
in
that
short
space
of
time
between
six
and
seven
during
which
the
great
court
is
largely
deserted
the
athletes
and
the
dawdlers
have
not
yet
returned
from
field
and
river
and
fellows
and
other
persons
young
enough
to
know
better
who
think
that
a
summer
evening
was
created
for
the
reading
of
books
have
not
yet
emerged
from
their
retreats
a
cook
or
two
moves
across
the
cobbled
spaces
with
trays
upon
their
heads
a
tradesman
boy
comes
out
of
the
corner
entrance
from
the
hostel
a
cat
or
two
stretches
himself
on
the
grass
but
for
the
rest
the
court
lies
in
broad
sunshine
the
shadows
slope
eastwards
and
the
fitful
splash
and
trickle
of
the
fountain
asserts
itself
clearly
above
the
gentle
rumble
of
trinity
street
within
the
room
in
which
these
two
sat
was
much
like
other
rooms
of
the
same
standing
only
in
this
one
case
the
walls
were
paneled
with
deal
three
doors
led
out
of
it
two
into
a
tiny
bedroom
and
a
tinier
respectively
the
third
on
to
the
passage
leading
to
the
frank
found
it
very
convenient
since
he
thus
was
enabled
at
every
hour
of
the
morning
when
the
lectures
broke
up
to
have
the
best
possible
excuse
for
conversing
with
his
friends
through
the
window
the
room
was
furnished
really
well
above
the
mantelpiece
where
rested
an
array
of
and
a
large
silver
hung
an
portrait
in
a
dull
gilded
frame
of
an
aged
man
with
a
ruff
round
his
neck
purchased
for
one
guinea
there
was
a
sofa
and
a
set
of
chairs
upholstered
in
a
good
damask
a
black
piano
by
broadwood
a
large
oval
table
a
bureau
shelves
filled
with
very
indiscriminate
literature
law
books
novels
badminton
magazines
and
ancient
school
editions
of
the
classics
a
mahogany
bookcase
packed
with
volumes
of
esthetic
appearance
poetry
books
with
white
labels
old
leather
tomes
and
all
the
rest
of
the
specimens
usual
to
a
man
who
has
once
thought
himself
literary
then
there
were
engravings
well
framed
round
the
walls
a
black
lamp
fitted
for
electric
light
hung
from
the
ceiling
there
were
a
couple
of
oak
chests
curiously
carved
on
the
stained
floor
lay
three
or
four
mellow
rugs
and
the
outside
blazed
with
geraniums
the
d√©bris
of
tea
rested
on
the
nearest
the
outer
door
frank
guiseley
too
lolling
in
the
in
a
white
silk
shirt
unbuttoned
at
the
throat
and
gray
flannel
trousers
and
one
white
shoe
was
very
pleasant
to
look
upon
his
hair
was
as
black
and
curly
as
a
neapolitan
he
had
a
smiling
humorous
mouth
and
black
eyes
of
an
extraordinary
twinkling
alertness
his
face
brown
in
its
proper
complexion
as
well
as
with
healthy
sunburning
he
had
played
very
vigorous
for
the
last
two
months
looked
like
a
boy
except
for
the
very
determined
mouth
and
the
short
straight
nose
he
was
a
little
below
middle
height
and
active
and
though
properly
speaking
he
was
not
exactly
handsome
he
was
quite
exceptionally
delightful
to
look
at
jack
kirkby
sitting
in
an
a
yard
away
and
in
the
same
sort
of
costume
except
that
he
wore
both
his
shoes
and
a
third
trinity
blazer
was
a
complete
contrast
in
appearance
the
other
had
something
of
a
southern
europe
look
jack
was
obviously
english
wholesome
red
cheeks
fair
hair
and
a
small
mustache
resembling
spun
silk
he
was
also
closely
on
six
feet
in
height
he
was
anxious
just
now
and
therefore
looked
rather
cross
fingering
the
very
minute
hairs
of
his
mustache
whenever
he
could
spare
the
time
from
smoking
and
looking
determinedly
away
from
frank
upon
the
floor
for
the
last
week
he
had
talked
over
this
affair
ever
since
the
amazing
announcement
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
once
more
in
this
preposterous
scheme
frank
really
meant
what
he
said
frank
had
a
terrible
way
of
meaning
what
he
said
he
reflected
with
dismay
there
was
the
affair
of
the
bread
and
butter
three
years
ago
before
either
of
them
had
learned
manners
this
had
consisted
in
the
fastening
up
in
separate
parcels
innumerable
pieces
of
bread
and
butter
addressing
each
with
the
name
of
the
reverend
junior
dean
who
had
annoyed
frank
in
some
way
and
the
leaving
of
the
parcels
about
in
every
corner
of
cambridge
in
hansom
cabs
on
seats
on
and
on
the
pavements
with
the
result
that
for
the
next
two
or
three
days
the
dean
staircase
was
crowded
with
messenger
boys
and
unemployables
anxious
to
return
apparently
lost
property
then
there
had
been
the
matter
of
the
flagging
of
a
fast
northern
train
in
the
middle
of
the
fens
with
a
red
to
find
out
if
it
were
really
true
that
the
train
would
stop
followed
by
a
rapid
retreat
on
bicycles
so
soon
as
it
had
been
ascertained
that
it
was
true
the
affair
of
the
german
prince
traveling
incognito
into
which
the
mayor
himself
had
been
drawn
and
the
affair
of
the
nun
who
smoked
a
short
black
pipe
in
the
great
court
shortly
before
midnight
before
gathering
up
her
skirts
and
vanishing
on
noiseless
feet
round
the
kitchen
quarters
into
the
gloom
of
neville
court
as
the
horrified
porter
descended
from
his
now
many
minds
could
have
conceived
these
things
a
smaller
number
of
people
would
have
announced
their
intention
of
doing
them
but
there
were
very
few
persons
who
would
actually
carry
them
all
out
to
the
very
end
in
fact
jack
reflected
frank
guiseley
was
about
the
only
man
of
his
acquaintance
who
could
possibly
have
done
them
and
he
had
done
them
all
on
his
own
sole
responsibility
he
had
remembered
too
during
the
past
week
certain
incidents
of
the
same
nature
at
eton
there
was
the
master
who
had
rashly
inquired
with
deep
sarcasm
on
the
fourth
or
fifth
occasion
in
one
week
when
frank
had
come
in
a
little
late
for
school
whether
guiseley
would
not
like
to
have
tea
before
pursuing
his
studies
frank
with
a
radiant
smile
of
gratitude
and
extraordinary
rapidity
had
answered
that
he
would
like
it
very
much
indeed
and
had
vanished
through
the
still
door
before
another
word
could
be
uttered
returning
with
a
look
of
childlike
innocence
at
about
minutes
to
six
please
sir
he
had
said
i
thought
you
said
i
might
go
and
have
you
had
tea
why
certainly
sir
at
webber
now
all
this
kind
of
thing
was
a
little
disconcerting
to
remember
now
truly
the
things
in
themselves
had
been
admirably
conceived
and
faithfully
executed
but
they
seemed
to
show
that
frank
was
the
kind
of
person
who
really
carried
through
what
other
people
only
talked
about
and
especially
if
he
announced
beforehand
that
he
intended
to
do
it
it
was
a
little
dismaying
therefore
for
his
friend
to
reflect
that
upon
the
arrival
of
the
famous
letter
from
lord
talgarth
father
six
days
previously
in
which
all
the
phrases
occurred
as
to
darkening
doors
and
roof
and
disgrace
to
the
family
frank
had
announced
that
he
proposed
to
take
his
father
at
his
word
sell
up
his
property
and
set
out
like
a
prince
in
a
to
make
his
fortune
jack
had
argued
till
he
was
sick
of
it
and
to
no
avail
frank
had
a
parry
for
every
thrust
why
would
he
wait
a
bit
until
the
governor
had
had
time
to
cool
down
because
the
governor
must
learn
sooner
or
later
that
words
really
meant
something
and
that
he
frank
was
not
going
to
stand
it
for
one
instant
why
would
he
come
and
stay
at
barham
till
further
notice
they
all
be
delighted
to
have
him
it
was
only
ten
miles
off
merefield
and
perhaps
because
frank
was
not
going
to
sponge
upon
his
friends
neither
was
he
going
to
skulk
about
near
home
well
if
he
was
so
damned
obstinate
why
did
he
go
into
the
city
or
even
to
the
bar
because
he
had
any
money
and
he
would
infinitely
sooner
go
on
the
tramp
than
sit
on
a
stool
well
why
did
he
enlist
like
a
gentleman
frank
dared
say
he
would
some
time
but
he
wanted
to
stand
by
himself
a
bit
first
and
see
the
world
let
see
the
letter
again
said
jack
at
last
where
is
it
frank
reflected
i
think
it
in
that
just
behind
your
head
he
said
no
it
is
it
in
the
pouch
on
the
floor
i
know
i
associated
it
somehow
with
smoking
and
by
the
way
give
me
a
cigarette
jack
tossed
him
his
case
opened
the
pouch
took
out
the
letter
and
read
it
slowly
through
again
merefield
court
near
harrogate
may
i
am
ashamed
of
you
sir
when
you
first
told
me
of
your
intention
i
warned
you
what
would
happen
if
you
persisted
and
i
repeat
it
now
since
you
have
deliberately
chosen
in
spite
of
all
that
i
have
said
to
go
your
own
way
and
to
become
a
papist
i
will
have
no
more
to
do
with
you
from
this
moment
you
cease
to
be
my
son
you
shall
not
while
i
live
darken
my
doors
again
or
sleep
under
my
roof
i
say
nothing
of
what
you
have
had
from
me
in
the
past
your
education
and
all
the
rest
and
since
i
do
not
wish
to
be
unduly
hard
upon
you
you
can
keep
the
remainder
of
your
allowance
up
to
july
and
the
furniture
of
your
rooms
but
after
that
not
one
penny
shall
you
have
from
me
you
can
go
to
your
priests
and
get
them
to
support
you
i
am
only
thankful
that
your
poor
mother
has
been
spared
this
blow
jack
made
a
small
murmurous
sound
as
he
finished
frank
chuckled
aloud
pitches
it
in
all
right
does
he
he
observed
dispassionately
if
it
had
been
my
governor
began
jack
slowly
my
dear
man
it
is
your
governor
it
mine
and
i
dashed
if
there
another
man
in
the
world
who
write
such
a
letter
as
that
nowadays
it
it
too
they
hardly
stand
it
at
the
adelphi
i
could
have
put
it
so
much
better
myself
poor
old
governor
have
you
answered
it
i
i
forget
i
know
i
meant
to
no
i
have
i
remember
now
and
i
sha
till
i
just
off
well
i
shall
remarked
jack
frank
turned
a
swift
face
upon
him
if
you
do
he
said
with
sudden
fierce
gravity
i
never
speak
to
you
again
i
mean
it
it
my
affair
and
i
shall
run
it
my
own
way
but
i
mean
it
now
give
me
your
word
of
honor
i
your
word
of
honor
this
instant
or
get
out
of
my
room
there
was
a
pause
then
all
right
said
jack
then
there
fell
a
silence
once
more
ii
the
news
began
to
be
rumored
about
soon
after
the
auction
that
frank
held
of
his
effects
a
couple
of
days
later
he
carried
out
the
scene
admirably
entirely
unassisted
even
by
jack
first
there
appeared
suddenly
all
over
cambridge
the
evening
before
the
sale
just
as
the
crowds
of
undergraduates
and
female
relations
began
to
circulate
about
after
tea
and
iced
strawberries
a
quantity
of
bearing
the
following
announcement
back
and
front
trinity
college

ten
precisely
all
friends
and
strangers
cordially
invited
no
reserve
price
it
served
its
purpose
admirably
for
by
soon
after
ten
quite
a
considerable
crowd
had
begun
to
assemble
and
it
was
only
after
a
very
serious
conversation
with
the
dean
that
the
sale
was
allowed
to
proceed
but
it
proceeded
with
the
distinct
understanding
that
a
college
porter
be
present
that
no
riotous
behavior
should
be
allowed
that
the
sale
was
a
genuine
one
and
that
guiseley
would
call
upon
the
dean
with
further
explanations
before
leaving
cambridge
the
scene
itself
was
most
impressive
frank
in
a
structure
resembling
an
auctioneer
box
erected
on
the
presided
with
extraordinary
gravity
hammer
in
hand
robed
in
a
bachelor
gown
and
hood
beneath
him
the
room
seethed
with
the
company
male
and
female
all
in
an
excellent
humor
and
quite
tolerable
prices
were
obtained
no
public
explanations
were
given
of
the
need
for
the
sale
and
jack
in
the
deepest
dismay
looked
in
again
that
afternoon
about
to
find
the
room
completely
stripped
and
frank
very
cheerful
still
in
his
hood
and
gown
smoking
a
cigarette
in
the
come
in
he
said
and
kindly
ask
me
to
lunch
the
last
porter
just
gone
jack
looked
at
him
he
seemed
amazingly
genial
and
natural
though
just
a
little
flushed
and
such
an
air
of
drama
as
there
was
about
him
was
obviously
deliberate
very
well
come
to
lunch
said
jack
where
are
you
going
to
dine
and
sleep
i
dining
in
hall
and
i
sleeping
in
a
hammock
go
and
look
at
my
bedroom
jack
went
across
the
bare
floor
and
looked
in
a
hammock
was
slung
across
from
a
couple
of
pegs
and
there
lay
a
small
beneath
it
a
basin
on
an
upturned
box
and
a
bath
completed
the
furniture
you
mad
ass
said
jack
and
is
that
all
you
have
left

i
going
to

the
dean
at
six
this
evening

proposes

in
the
early
hours
of

you
going

frank
extended
two
flanneled
legs
ending
in
solid
boots
these
a
flannel
shirt
no
tie
a
cap
a
gray
jacket
jack
stood
again
in
silence
looking
at
him
how
much
money
did
your
sale
make
that
immaterial
besides
i
forget
the
important
fact
is
that
when
i
paid
all
my
bills
i
shall
have
thirteen
pounds
eleven
shillings
and
eightpence
what
thirteen
pounds
eleven
shillings
and
eightpence
jack
burst
into
a
mirthless
laugh
well
come
along
to
lunch
he
said
it
seemed
to
jack
that
he
moved
in
a
dreary
kind
of
dream
that
afternoon
as
he
went
about
with
frank
from
shop
to
shop
paying
bills
bulged
and
jingled
a
good
deal
as
they
started
he
had
drawn
all
his
remaining
money
in
gold
from
the
bank
and
they
bulged
and
jingled
considerably
less
as
the
two
returned
to
tea
in
jesus
lane
there
on
the
table
he
spread
out
the
coins
he
had
bought
some
tobacco
and
two
or
three
other
things
that
afternoon
and
the
total
amounted
now
but
to
twelve
pounds
nineteen
shillings
and
fourpence
call
it
thirteen
pounds
said
frank
there
many
a
poor
man
do
be
a
damned
fool
said
jack
i
being
simply
prudent
said
frank
a
contented
heart
jack
thrust
a
cup
of
tea
and
the
buttered
buns
before
him
these
two
were
as
nearly
brothers
as
possible
in
everything
but
blood
their
homes
lay
within
ten
miles
of
one
another
they
had
gone
to
a
private
school
together
to
eton
and
to
trinity
they
had
ridden
together
in
the
holidays
shot
dawdled
bathed
skated
and
all
the
rest
they
were
considerably
more
brothers
to
one
another
than
were
frank
and
archie
his
actual
elder
brother
known
to
the
world
as
viscount
merefield
jack
did
not
particularly
approve
of
archie
he
thought
him
a
pompous
ass
and
occasionally
said
so
for
frank
he
had
quite
an
extraordinary
affection
though
he
would
not
have
expressed
it
so
to
himself
for
all
the
world
and
a
very
real
admiration
of
a
quite
indefinable
kind
it
was
impossible
to
say
why
he
admired
him
frank
did
nothing
very
well
but
everything
rather
well
he
played
rugby
football
just
not
well
enough
to
represent
his
college
he
had
been
in
the
lower
boats
at
eton
and
the
lent
boat
of
his
first
year
at
cambridge
then
he
had
given
up
rowing
and
played
in
the
summer
and
fives
in
the
lent
term
just
well
enough
to
make
a
brisk
and
interesting
game
he
was
not
at
all
learned
he
had
reached
the
first
hundred
at
eton
and
had
read
law
at
cambridge
that
convenient
branch
of
study
which
for
the
most
part
fills
the
vacuum
for
intelligent
persons
who
have
no
particular
bent
and
are
heartily
sick
of
classics
and
he
had
taken
a
third
class
and
his
degree
a
day
or
two
before
he
was
remarkably
averaged
therefore
and
yet
somehow
or
another
there
was
that
in
him
which
compelled
jack
admiration
i
suppose
it
was
that
which
is
conveniently
labeled
character
certainly
nearly
everybody
who
came
into
contact
with
him
felt
the
same
in
some
degree
his
becoming
a
catholic
had
been
an
amazing
shock
to
jack
who
had
always
supposed
that
frank
like
himself
took
the
ordinary
sensible
english
view
of
religion
to
be
a
professed
unbeliever
was
bad
form
it
was
like
being
a
little
englander
or
a
radical
to
be
pious
was
equally
bad
form
it
resembled
a
violent
devotion
to
the
union
jack
no
religion
to
jack
and
he
had
always
hitherto
supposed
to
frank
was
a
department
of
life
in
which
one
did
not
express
any
particular
views
one
did
not
say
one
prayers
one
attended
chapel
at
the
proper
times
if
one
was
musical
one
occasionally
went
to
king
on
sunday
afternoon
in
the
country
one
went
to
church
on
sunday
morning
as
one
went
to
the
stables
in
the
afternoon
and
that
was
about
all
frank
had
been
too
so
extremely
secretive
about
the
whole
thing
he
had
marched
into
jack
rooms
in
jesus
lane
one
morning
nearly
a
fortnight
ago
come
to
mass
at
the
catholic
church
he
said
why
the
began
jack
i
got
to
go
i
a
catholic
i
became
one
last
week
jack
had
stared
at
him
suddenly
convinced
that
someone
was
mad
when
he
had
verified
that
it
was
really
a
fact
that
frank
had
placed
himself
under
instruction
three
months
before
and
had
made
his
confession
his
confession
on
friday
and
had
been
conditionally
baptized
when
he
had
certified
himself
of
all
these
things
and
had
begun
to
find
coherent
language
once
more
he
had
demanded
why
frank
had
done
this
because
it
the
true
religion
said
frank
are
you
coming
to
mass
or
are
you
not
jack
had
gone
then
and
had
come
away
more
bewildered
than
ever
as
to
what
it
was
all
about
he
had
attempted
to
make
a
few
inquiries
but
frank
had
waved
his
hands
at
him
and
repeated
that
obviously
the
catholic
religion
was
the
true
one
and
that
he
could
be
bothered
and
now
here
they
were
at
tea
in
jesus
lane
for
the
last
time
of
course
there
was
a
little
suppressed
excitement
about
frank
he
drank
three
cups
of
tea
and
took
the
last
and
the
under
piece
of
buttered
bun
without
apologies
and
he
talked
a
good
deal
rather
fast
it
seemed
that
he
had
really
no
particular
plans
as
to
what
he
was
going
to
do
after
he
had
walked
out
of
cambridge
with
his
early
next
morning
he
just
meant
he
said
to
go
along
and
see
what
happened
he
had
had
a
belt
made
which
pleased
him
exceedingly
into
which
his
money
could
be
put
it
lay
on
the
table
between
them
during
tea
and
he
proposed
naturally
to
spend
as
little
of
that
money
as
possible
no
he
would
not
take
one
penny
piece
from
jack
it
would
be
simply
scandalous
if
he
a
boy
and
an
university
man
keep
body
and
soul
together
by
his
own
labor
there
would
be
presently
he
supposed
and
and
small
jobs
on
farms
he
would
just
go
along
and
see
what
happened
besides
there
were
always
casual
wards
were
there
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
and
meet
other
men
he
supposed
who
put
him
in
the
way
of
things
oh
he
get
on
all
right
would
he
ever
come
to
barham
well
if
it
came
in
the
day
work
he
would
yes
certainly
he
be
most
obliged
if
his
letters
might
be
sent
there
and
he
could
write
for
them
when
he
wanted
or
even
call
for
them
if
as
he
said
it
came
in
the
day
work
what
was
he
going
to
do
in
the
winter
he
had
the
slightest
idea
he
supposed
what
other
people
did
in
the
winter
perhaps
he
have
got
a
place
by
then
gamekeeper
perhaps
he
like
to
be
a
gamekeeper
at
this
jack
mentally
threw
up
the
sponge
you
really
mean
to
go
on
at
this
rotten
idea
of
yours
frank
opened
his
eyes
wide
why
of
course
good
lord
did
you
think
i
was
bluffing
but
but
it
perfectly
mad
why
on
earth
do
you
get
a
proper
situation
somewhere
or
something
my
dear
man
said
frank
if
you
will
have
it
it
because
i
want
to
do
exactly
what
i
going
to
do
no
i
being
perfectly
serious
thought
for
ages
that
we
all
wrong
somehow
we
all
so
beastly
artificial
i
do
want
to
preach
but
i
want
to
test
things
for
myself
my
religion
tells
me
he
broke
off
no
this
is
fooling
going
to
do
it
because
i
going
to
do
it
and
i
really
going
to
do
it
i
not
going
to
be
an
amateur
like
slumming
i
going
to
find
out
things
for
myself
but
on
the
roads
expostulated
jack
exactly
that
the
very
point
back
to
the
land
jack
sat
up
good
lord
he
said
why
i
never
thought
of
it
what
it
your
old
grandmother
coming
out
frank
stared
grandmother
yes
old
mrs
kelly
frank
laughed
suddenly
and
loudly
by
george
he
said
i
daresay
it
is
old
grandmamma
kelly
she
was
a
gipsy
so
she
was
i
believe
you
hit
it
jack
let
see
she
was
my
grandfather
second
wife
was
she
jack
nodded
and
he
picked
her
up
off
the
roads
on
his
own
estate
was
she
trespassing
or
something
jack
nodded
again
yes
he
said
and
he
was
a
magistrate
and
ought
to
have
committed
her
and
he
married
her
instead
she
was
a
girl
traveling
with
her
parents
frank
sat
smiling
genially
that
it
he
said
then
i
bound
to
make
a
success
of
it
and
he
took
another
cigarette
then
one
more
thought
came
to
jack
he
had
determined
already
to
make
use
of
it
if
necessary
and
somehow
this
seemed
to
be
the
moment
and
jenny
launton
he
said
i
suppose
you
thought
of
her
a
curious
look
came
into
frank
eyes
a
look
of
great
gravity
and
tenderness
and
the
humor
died
out
he
said
nothing
for
an
instant
then
he
drew
out
of
his
a
letter
in
an
envelope
and
tossed
it
gently
over
to
jack
i
telling
her
in
that
he
said
i
going
to
post
it
after
i
seen
the
dean
jack
glanced
down
at
it
miss
launton
the
rectory
merefield
yorks
ran
the
inscription
he
turned
it
over
it
was
fastened
and
sealed
i
told
her
we
must
wait
a
bit
said
frank
and
that
i
write
again
in
a
few
weeks
jack
was
silent
and
you
think
it
fair
on
her
he
asked
deliberately
frank
face
broke
up
into
humor
that
for
her
to
say
he
observed
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
not
at
all
afraid
but
a
gamekeeper
wife
and
you
a
catholic
ah
you
do
know
jenny
smiled
frank
jenny
and
i
quite
understand
one
another
thank
you
very
much
but
is
it
quite
fair
good
lord
shouted
frank
suddenly
roused
fair
what
the
devil
does
it
matter
do
you
know
that
all
fair
under
certain
circumstances
i
do
bar
that
rotten
conventionalism
we
all
rotten
rotten
i
tell
you
and
i
going
to
start
fresh
so
jenny
kindly
do
talk
of
what
you
do
understand
he
stood
up
stretching
then
he
threw
the
end
of
his
cigarette
away
i
must
go
to
the
dean
he
said
it
close
on
the
iii
the
reverend
james
mackintosh
was
an
excellent
official
of
his
college
and
performed
his
duties
with
care
and
punctilium
he
rose
about
seven
every
morning
drank
a
cup
of
tea
and
went
to
chapel
after
chapel
he
breakfasted
on
tuesdays
and
thursdays
with
two
undergraduates
in
their
first
year
selected
in
alphabetical
order
seated
at
his
table
on
the
other
days
of
the
week
in
solitude
at
ten
he
lectured
usually
on
one
of
paul
epistles
on
which
subjects
he
possessed
filled
with
every
conceivable
piece
of
information
that
could
be
gathered
together
grammatical
philological
topographical
industrial
social
biographical
with
a
few
remarks
on
the
fauna
flora
imports
characteristics
and
geological
features
of
those
countries
to
which
those
epistles
were
written
and
in
which
they
were
composed
these
notes
guaranteed
to
guide
any
student
who
really
mastered
them
to
success
and
even
distinction
in
his
examinations
were
the
result
of
a
lifetime
of
loving
labor
and
some
day
no
doubt
will
be
issued
in
the
neat
blue
covers
of
the
cambridge
bible
for
schools
from
eleven
to
twelve
he
lectured
on
church
history
of
the
first
five
centuries
after
which
period
it
will
be
remembered
by
all
historical
students
church
history
practically
ceased
at
one
he
lunched
from
two
to
four
he
walked
rapidly
sometimes
again
in
company
with
a
serious
theological
student
along
the
course
known
as
the
grantchester
grind
or
to
coton
and
back
at
four
he
had
tea
at
five
he
settled
down
to
administer
discipline
to
the
college
by
summoning
and
remonstrating
with
such
undergraduates
as
had
failed
to
comply
with
the
various
regulations
at
seven
he
dined
in
hall
a
meek
figure
clean
shaven
and
spectacled
seated
between
an
infidel
philosopher
and
a
socialist
he
drank
a
single
glass
of
wine
afterwards
in
the
combination
room
smoked
one
cigarette
and
retired
again
to
his
rooms
to
write
letters
to
parents
if
necessary
and
to
run
over
his
notes
for
next
day
and
he
did
this
with
the
usual
mild
variations
of
a
university
life
every
weekday
for
of
the
year
of
the
other
third
he
spent
part
in
switzerland
dressed
in
a
neat
gray
norfolk
suit
with
knickerbockers
and
the
rest
with
clerical
friends
of
the
scholastic
type
it
was
a
very
solemn
thought
to
him
how
great
were
his
responsibilities
and
what
a
privilege
it
was
to
live
in
the
whirl
and
stir
of
one
of
the
intellectual

frank
guiseley
was
to
mackintosh
a
very
great
puzzle
he
had
certainly
been
insubordinate
in
his
first
year
mackintosh
gravely
suspected
him
of
the
affair
which
had
so
annoyed
his
colleague
but
he
certainly
had
been
very
steady
and
even
deferential
ever
since
he
always
took
off
his
hat
for
example
to
mackintosh
with
great
politeness
certainly
he
was
not
very
regular
at
chapel
and
he
did
not
dine
in
hall
nearly
so
often
as
mackintosh
would
have
wished
for
was
it
not
part
of
the
university
idea
that
men
of
all
grades
of
society
should
meet
as
equals
under
the
college
roof
but
then
he
had
never
been
summoned
for
any
very
grave
or
disgraceful
breach
of
the
rules
and
was
never
insolent
or
offensive
to
any
of
the
fellows
finally
he
came
of
a
very
distinguished
family
and
mackintosh
had
the
keenest
remembrance
still
of
his
own
single
interview
three
years
ago
with
the
earl
of
talgarth
mackintosh
wondered
then
exactly
what
he
would
have
to
say
to
guiseley
and
what
guiseley
would
have
to
say
to
him
he
thought
if
the
young
man
were
really
going
down
for
good
as
he
had
understood
this
morning
it
was
only
his
plain
duty
to
say
a
few
tactful
words
about
responsibility
and
steadiness
that
ridiculous
auction
would
serve
as
his
text
mackintosh
paused
an
instant
as
he
always
did
before
saying
come
in
to
the
knock
on
the
door
i
think
he
thought
it
helped
to
create
a
little
impression
of
importance
then
he
said
it
and
frank
walked
in
good
evening
guiseley
yes
please
sit
down
i
understood
from
you
this
morning
that
you
wished
for
your
please
said
frank
just
so
said
mackintosh
drawing
the
book
resembling
the
butt
of
a
towards
him
and
you
are
going
down
yes
said
frank
going
home
murmured
the
dean
inscribing
frank
name
in
his
neat
little
handwriting
no
said
frank
not
to
london
perhaps
well
not
exactly
said
frank
at
least
not
just
yet
mackintosh
blotted
the
book
carefully
and
extracted
the
he
pushed
it
gently
towards
frank
about
that
auction
he
said
smiling
indulgently
i
did
want
to
have
a
word
with
you
about
that
it
was
very
unusual
and
i
wondered
but
i
am
happy
to
think
that
there
was
no
disturbance
but
can
you
tell
me
exactly
why
you
chose
that
form
of
of
i
wanted
to
make
as
much
money
as
ever
i
could
said
frank
indeed
yes
and
and
you
were
successful
i
cleared
all
my
debts
anyhow
said
frank
serenely
i
thought
that
very
important
mackintosh
smiled
again
certainly
this
young
man
was
very
well
behaved
and
deferential
well
that
satisfactory
and
you
are
going
to
read
at
the
bar
now
if
you
will
let
me
say
so
guiseley
even
at
this
late
hour
i
must
say
that
i
think
that
a
third
class
might
have
been
bettered
but
no
doubt
your
tutor
has
said
all
that
yes
i
think
so
well
then
a
little
more
application
and
energy
now
may
perhaps
make
up
for
lost
time
i
suppose
you
will
go
to
the
temple
in
october
frank
looked
at
him
pensively
a
moment
no
mackintosh
he
said
suddenly
i
going
on
the
roads
i
mean
it
quite
seriously
my
father
disowned
me
i
starting
out
to
make
my
own
living
there
was
dead
silence
for
an
instant
the
dean
face
was
stricken
as
though
by
horror
yet
frank
saw
he
had
not
in
the
least
taken
it
in
yes
that
really
so
he
said
please
do
argue
with
me
about
it
i
perfectly
determined
your
father
lord
talgarth
the
roads
your
own
living
the
college
authorities
responsibility
words
of
this
sort
burst
from
mackintosh
mouth
yes
it
because
i
become
a
catholic
i
expect
you
heard
that
sir
mackintosh
threw
himself
back
if
so
fierce
a
word
may
be
used
of
so
mild
a
manner
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
guiseley
kindly
tell
me
all
about
it
i
had
not
heard
one
word
not
one
word
frank
made
a
great
effort
and
told
the
story
quite
fairly
and
quite
politely
he
described
his
convictions
as
well
as
he
could
the
various
steps
he
had
taken
and
the
climax
of
the
letter
from
his
father
then
he
braced
himself
to
hear
what
would
be
said
or
rather
he
retired
within
himself
and
so
to
speak
shut
the
door
and
pulled
down
the
blinds
it
was
all
said
exactly
as
he
knew
it
would
be
mackintosh
touched
upon
a
loving
father
impatience
the
son
youth
and
impetuosity
the
shock
to
an
ancient
family
the
responsibilities
of
membership
in
that
family
the
dangers
of
rash
decisions
and
finally
the
obvious
errors
of
the
church
of
rome
he
began
several
sentences
with
the
phrase
no
thinking
man
at
the
present
day
in
fact
mackintosh
was
so
soon
as
he
had
recovered
from
the
first
shock
extraordinarily
sensible
and
reasonable
he
said
all
the
proper
things
all
the
sensible
and
reasonable
and
things
and
he
said
them
not
offensively
or
contemptuously
but
tactfully
and
persuasively
and
he
put
into
it
the
whole
of
his
personality
such
as
it
was
he
even
quoted
paul
he
perspired
a
little
gently
towards
the
end
so
he
took
off
his
glasses
and
wiped
them
looking
still
with
a
smile
through
kind
eyes
at
this
young
man
who
sat
so
still
for
frank
was
so
quiet
that
the
dean
thought
him
already
half
persuaded
then
once
more
he
summed
up
when
his
glasses
were
fixed
again
he
ran
through
his
arguments
lightly
and
efficiently
and
ended
by
a
quiet
little
assumption
that
frank
was
going
to
be
reasonable
to
write
to
his
father
once
more
and
to
wait
at
least
a
week
he
even
called
him
my
dear
boy
thanks
very
much
said
frank
then
you
think
it
over
quietly
my
dear
boy
come
and
talk
to
me
again
i
given
you
your
but
you
need
use
it
come
in
evening
after
hall
frank
stood
up
thanks
very
much
mackintosh
i
i
certainly
remember
what
you
said
he
took
up
his
as
if
mechanically
then
you
can
leave
that
for
the
present
smiled
the
dean
pointing
at
it
i
can
write
you
another
you
know
frank
put
it
down
quickly
oh
certainly
he
said
well
guiseley
i
i
ca
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
that
you
confided
in
me
young
men
are
a
little
unwise
and
impetuous
sometimes
you
know
i
shall
expect
you
when
frank
reached
the
court
below
he
stood
waiting
a
moment
then
a
large
smile
broke
out
on
his
face
and
he
hurried
across
to
a
passage
opposite
found
a
friend
door
open
and
rushed
in
the
room
was
empty
he
flew
across
to
the
window
and
crouched
down
peeping
over
the
sill
at
the
opening
on
the
other
side
of
the
court
leading
to
staircase
he
was
rewarded
almost
instantly
even
as
he
settled
himself
on
the
window
seat
a
black
figure
with
gown
ballooning
behind
hurried
out
and
whisked
through
the
archway
leading
towards
the
street
he
gave
him
twenty
seconds
and
then
ran
out
himself
and
went
in
pursuit
up
the
lane
he
sighted
him
once
more
and
following
cautiously
on
tiptoe
with
a
handkerchief
up
to
his
face
was
in
time
to
behold
mackintosh
disappear
into
the
little
telegraph
office
on
the
left
of
trinity
street
that
settles
it
then
observed
frank
almost
aloud
poor
jack
afraid
i
sha
be
able
to
breakfast
with
him
after
all
iv
it
was
a
little
after
four
on
the
following
morning
that
a
policeman
pacing
with
slow
flat
feet
along
the
little
lane
that
leads
from
trinity
hall
to
trinity
college
yawning
as
he
went
and
entirely
unconscious
of
the
divine
morning
air
bright
as
wine
and
clear
as
water
beheld
a
remarkable
spectacle
there
first
appeared
suddenly
tossed
on
to
the
spikes
that
top
the
gate
that
guards
the
hostel
a
species
of
pad
that
hung
over
on
both
sides
of
the
formidable
array
of
points
upon
this
more
cautiously
was
placed
by
invisible
hands
a
very
old
saddle
without
any
stirrups
the
policeman
stepped
back
a
little
and
flattened
himself
comparatively
speaking
against
the
outer
wall
of
the
hostel
itself
there
followed
a
silence
suddenly
without
any
warning
a
heavy
body
discernible
a
moment
later
as
a
small
filled
to
bursting
fell
abruptly
on
to
the
pavement
and
again
a
moment
later
two
hands
made
their
appearance
grasping
with
extreme
care
the
central
rod
on
which
the
spikes
were
supposed
to
revolve
on
either
side
of
the
saddle
still
the
policeman
did
not
make
any
sign
he
only
sidled
a
step
or
two
nearer
and
stood
waiting
when
he
looked
up
again
a
young
gentleman
in
flannel
trousers
gray
jacket
boots
and
an
old
deerstalker
was
seated
astride
of
the
saddle
with
his
back
to
the
observer
there
was
a
pause
while
the
rider
looked
to
this
side
and
that
and
then
with
a
sudden
movement
he
had
dropped
clear
of
the
wall
and
come
down
on
feet
and
hands
to
the
pavement
good
morning
officer
said
the
young
gentleman
rising
and
dusting
his
hands
it
all
right
like
to
see
my
or
perhaps
half
a
crown
v
about
six
in
the
morning
jack
kirkby
awoke
suddenly
in
his
bedroom
in
jesus
lane
this
was
very
unusual
and
he
wondered
what
it
was
all
about
he
thought
of
frank
almost
instantly
with
a
jerk
and
after
looking
at
his
watch
very
properly
turned
over
and
tried
to
go
to
sleep
again
but
the
attempt
was
useless
there
were
far
too
many
things
to
think
about
and
he
framed
so
many
speeches
to
be
delivered
with
convincing
force
at
breakfast
to
his
misguided
friend
that
by
seven
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
get
up
go
and
take
frank
to
bathe
and
have
breakfast
with
him
at
eight
instead
of
nine
he
would
have
longer
time
too
for
his
speeches
he
got
out
of
bed
and
pulled
up
his
blind
and
the
sight
of
the
towers
of
sidney
sussex
college
gilded
with
sunshine
determined
him
finally
when
you
go
to
bathe
before
breakfast
at
cambridge
you
naturally
put
on
as
few
clothes
as
possible
and
do
not
even
if
you
do
so
at
other
times
say
your
prayers
so
jack
put
on
a
sweater
trousers
socks
canvas
shoes
and
a
blazer
and
went
immediately
down
the
stairs
as
he
undid
the
door
he
noticed
a
white
thing
lying
beneath
it
and
took
it
up
it
was
a
note
addressed
to
himself
in
frank
handwriting
and
there
standing
on
the
steps
he
read
it
through
and
his
heart
turned
suddenly
sick
there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
knowing
that
a
catastrophe
is
going
to
happen
and
knowing
that
it
has
happened
jack
knew
at
least
with
all
his
reasonable
part
that
frank
was
going
to
leave
cambridge
in
the
preposterous
manner
described
after
breakfast
with
himself
and
it
was
partly
because
of
this
very
knowledge
that
he
had
got
up
earlier
in
order
to
have
an
extra
hour
with
frank
before
the
final
severance
came
yet
there
was
something
in
him
the
same
thing
that
had
urged
him
to
rehearse
little
speeches
in
bed
just
now
that
told
him
that
until
it
had
actually
happened
it
had
not
happened
and
just
conceivably
might
not
happen
after
all
and
he
had
had
no
idea
how
strong
this
hopeful
strain
had
been
in
him
nor
for
that
matter
how
very
deeply
and
almost
romantically
he
was
attached
to
frank
until
he
felt
his
throat
hammering
and
his
head
becoming
stupid
as
he
read
the
terse
little
note
in
the
fresh
morning
air
of
jesus
lane
it
ran
as
follows
dear
jack
it
no
good
and
i
off
early
that
ass
mackintosh
went
and
wired
to
my
people
directly
i
left
him
i
tracked
him
down
and
there
be
the
devil
to
pay
unless
i
clear
out
so
i
come
to
breakfast
sorry
yours
by
the
way
you
might
as
well
go
round
to
the
little
man
and
try
to
keep
him
quiet
tell
him
it
make
a
scandal
for
trinity
college
cambridge
if
he
makes
a
fuss
that
stop
him
perhaps
and
you
might
try
to
rescue
my
saddle
from
the
porter
he
probably
got
it
by
now
three
minutes
later
a
figure
in
a
sweater
gray
trousers
canvas
shoes
third
trinity
blazer
and
no
cap
stood
very
inarticulate
with
breathlessness
at
the
door
of
the
senior
dean
rooms
demanding
of
a
scandalized
to
see
the
official
in
question
in
his
barth
sir
expostulated
the
old
woman
then
he
must
come
out
of
it
panted
that
is
if
out
o
bed
then
he
can
stop
in
it
if
he
is
i
tell
you
jack
gave
up
arguing
he
took
the
old
lady
firmly
by
the
shoulders
and
placed
her
in
the
doorway
of
the
then
he
was
up
the
inner
stairs
in
three
strides
through
the
and
was
tapping
at
the
door
of
the
bedroom
a
faint
sound
of
splashing
ceased
who
there
do
it
me
sir
kirkby
i
sorry
to
disturb
you
but
do
come
in
cried
an
agitated
voice
with
a
renewed
sound
of
water
as
if
someone
had
hastily
scrambled
out
of
the
bath
jack
cautiously
turned
the
handle
and
opened
the
door
a
crack
a
cry
of
dismay
answered
his
move
followed
by
a
tremendous
commotion
and
swishing
of
linen
i
coming
in
sir
said
jack
struggling
between
agitation
and
laughter
it
was
obvious
from
the
sounds
that
the
clergyman
had
got
into
bed
again
wet
and
as
god
made
him
there
was
no
answer
and
jack
pushed
the
door
wider
and
went
in
it
was
as
he
had
thought
his
unwilling
host
had
climbed
back
into
bed
as
hastily
as
possible
and
the
wildly
disordered
were
gathered
round
his
person
a
face
with
wet
hair
looking
very
odd
and
childlike
without
his
glasses
regarded
him
with
the
look
of
one
who
sees
sacrilege
done
a
long
flannel
nightgown
lay
on
the
ground
between
the
steaming
bath
and
the
bed
and
a
quantity
of
water
lay
about
on
the
floor
in
footprints
and
otherwise
may
i
ask
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
disgraceful
i
sorry
sir
said
jack
briefly
but
frank
guiseley
bolted
just
found
this
note
it
did
not
occur
to
him
as
he
handed
the
note
to
a
bare
arm
coyly
protruded
from
the
tangled
that
this
very
officer
of
the
college
was
referred
to
in
it
as
that
ass
and
the
little
man
all
his
attention
not
occupied
with
frank
was
fixed
on
the
surprising
new
discovery
that
deans
had
bodies
and
used
real
baths
like
other
people
somehow
that
had
never
occurred
to
him
he
had
never
imagined
them
except
in
smooth
black
clothes
and
white
linen
his
discovery
seemed
to
make
mackintosh
more
human
somehow
the
dean
read
the
note
through
as
modestly
as
possible
holding
it
very
close
to
his
nose
as
his
glasses
were
unattainable
with
an
arm
of
which
not
more
than
the
wrist
appeared
he
swallowed
in
his
throat
once
or
twice
and
seemed
to
taste
something
with
his
lips
as
his
manner
was
this
is
terrible
said
the
dean
had
you
any
idea
i
knew
he
was
going
some
time
said
jack
and
understood
that
you
knew
too
but
i
had
no
idea
you
did
telegraph
did
you
sir
i
certainly
telegraphed
yes
to
lord
talgarth
it
was
my
duty
but
well
he
spotted
it
that
all
and
now
he
gone
what
to
be
done
mackintosh
considered
a
moment
or
two
jack
made
an
impatient
movement
i
must
telegraph
again
said
the
dean
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
exhausted
the
resources
of
civilization
but
good
lord
sir
yes
i
must
telegraph
again
as
soon
as
i
dressed
or
perhaps
you
would
office
does
open
till
eight
that
no
good
he
be
miles
away
by
then
it
the
only
thing
to
be
done
said
the
dean
with
sudden
energy
i
forbid
you
to
take
any
other
steps
kirkby
i
am
responsible
but
we
must
not
make
a
scandal
what
else
did
you
propose
why
fifty
things
police
certainly
not
we
must
make
no
scandal
as
he
as
he
very
properly
says
the
dean
swallowed
in
his
throat
again
jack
thought
afterwards
that
it
must
have
been
the
memory
of
certain
other
phrases
in
the
letter
so
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
leave
me
instantly
kirkby
i
will
finish
my
dressing
and
deal
with
the
matter
jack
wheeled
and
went
out
of
the
room
it
was
a
miserable
breakfast
to
which
he
sat
down
half
an
hour
later
still
in
flannels
and
without
his
bath
frank
place
was
laid
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
he
had
given
his
landlady
last
night
and
he
had
not
the
heart
to
push
the
things
aside
there
were
soles
for
two
and
four
boiled
eggs
there
was
coffee
and
marmalade
and
toast
and
rolls
and
fruit
and
the
comfortable
appearance
of
the
table
simply
mocked
him
he
had
had
very
confused
ideas
just
now
as
to
what
was
possible
with
regard
to
the
pursuit
of
frank
a
general
vision
of
twenty
each
with
a
chauffeur
and
an
observant
policeman
was
all
that
had
presented
itself
to
his
imagination
but
he
had
begun
to
realize
by
now
that
you
can
not
after
all
abduct
a
young
man
who
has
committed
no
crime
and
carry
him
back
unwillingly
even
to
cambridge
neither
the
dean
of
trinity
nor
a
father
possesses
quite
unlimited
power
over
the
freedom
of
a
pupil
and
a
son
and
after
all
frank
had
only
taken
his
father
at
his
word
these
reflections
however
did
not
improve
the
situation
he
felt
quite
certain
in
theory
that
something
more
could
be
done
than
feebly
to
send
another
telegram
or
two
the
only
difficulty
was
to
identify
that
something
he
had
vague
ideas
himself
of
hiring
a
by
the
day
and
proceeding
to
scour
the
country
round
cambridge
but
even
this
did
not
stand
scrutiny
if
he
had
failed
to
persuade
frank
to
remain
in
cambridge
it
was
improbable
that
he
could
succeed
in
persuading
him
to
return
even
if
he
found
him
about
eight
important
roads
run
out
of
cambridge
and
he
had
not
a
glimmer
of
an
idea
as
to
which
of
these
he
had
taken
it
was
possible
even
that
he
had
not
taken
any
of
them
and
was
walking
across
country
that
would
be
quite
characteristic
of
frank
he
finished
breakfast
dismally
and
blew
through
an
empty
pipe
staring
lackadaisically
out
of
the
window
at
the
wall
of
sidney
sussex
for
two
or
three
minutes
before
lighting
up
cambridge
seemed
an
extraordinary
flat
and
stupid
place
now
that
frank
was
no
longer
within
it
really
there
was
nothing
particular
to
do
it
had
become
almost
a
regular
engagement
for
him
to
step
round
to
the
great
court
about
eleven
and
see
what
was
to
be
done
sometimes
frank
wanted
sometimes
a
canoe
on
the
backs
at
any
rate
they
would
either
lunch
or
dine
together
and
if
they
did
well
at
any
rate
frank
was
there
he
tried
to
picture
to
himself
what
frank
was
doing
he
had
visions
of
a
sunlit
road
running
across
a
fen
with
a
figure
tramping
up
it
of
a
little
wayside
inn
and
frank
drinking
beer
in
the
shade
but
it
seemed
an
amazing
waste
of
company
that
the
figure
should
always
be
alone
why
had
he
proposed
to
go
with
him
himself
he
did
know
except
that
it
certainly
would
not
have
been
accepted
and
yet
they
could
have
had
quite
a
pleasant
time
for
a
couple
of
months
and
after
a
couple
of
months
surely
frank
would
have
had
enough
of
it
but
again
would
he
frank
seemed
really
in
earnest
about
making
his
living
permanently
and
when
frank
said
that
he
was
going
do
a
thing
he
usually
did
it
and
jack
kirkby
did
not
see
himself
leaving
his
own
mother
and
sisters
indefinitely
until
frank
had
learned
not
to
be
a
fool
he
lit
his
pipe
at
last
and
then
remembered
the
commission
with
regard
to
the
saddle
whatever
that
might
mean
he
would
stroll
round
presently
and
talk
to
the
porter
about
it
yes
he
would
go
at
once
and
he
would
just
look
in
at
frank
rooms
again
there
was
the
hammock
to
fetch
too
but
it
was
a
dreary
little
visit
he
went
round
as
he
was
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
trying
to
whistle
between
his
teeth
and
smoke
simultaneously
and
he
had
to
hold
his
pipe
in
his
hand
out
of
respect
for
rules
as
he
conversed
with
the
stately
hoppett
in
trinity
gateway
hoppett
knew
nothing
about
any
saddle
at
least
not
for
public
communication
but
his
air
of
deep
and
diplomatic
suspiciousness
belied
his
words
it
all
right
said
jack
pleasantly
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
elopement
the
dean
knows
all
about
it
i
know
nothing
about
that
sir
said
hoppett
judicially
then
you
not
got
the
saddle
i
have
not
sir
frank
outer
door
was
open
as
jack
came
to
the
familiar
staircase
and
his
heart
leaped
in
spite
of
himself
as
he
peered
in
and
heard
footsteps
in
the
bedroom
beyond
but
it
was
the
with
a
mop
and
a
disapproving
countenance
who
looked
out
presently
he
gone
jillings
said
jack
jillings
sniffed
she
had
heard
tales
of
the
auction
and
thought
it
a
very
improper
thing
for
so
pleasant
a
young
gentleman
to
do
yes
sir
there
is
a
saddle
here
is
there
saddle
sir
no
sir
what
should
there
be
a
saddle
here
for
oh
well
said
jack
vaguely
i
come
to
fetch
away
the
hammock
anyhow
certainly
the
rooms
looked
desolate
even
the
carpets
were
gone
and
the
unstained
boards
in
the
middle
seemed
suggestive
of
peculiar
dreariness
it
was
really
very
difficult
to
believe
that
these
were
the
rooms
where
he
and
frank
had
had
such
pleasant
times
little
friendly
and
dinners
and
absurd
theatricals
in
which
frank
had
sustained
with
extreme
rapidity
with
the
aid
of
hardly
any
properties
except
a
a
burnt
cork
and
three
or
four
wisps
of
hair
of
various
shades
the
part
of
almost
any
eminent
authority
in
the
university
of
cambridge
that
you
cared
to
name
there
were
long
histories
invented
by
frank
himself
of
the
darker
sides
of
the
lives
of
the
more
respectable
members
of
the
senate
histories
that
grew
like
legends
term
by
term
in
which
the
most
desperate
deeds
were
done
the
master
of
trinity
for
example
in
these
sagas
would
pass
through
extraordinary
love
adventures
or
discover
the
north
pole
or
give
a
lecture
with
practical
examples
of
the
art
of
flying
the
provost
of
king
would
conspire
with
the
president
of
queen
college
to
murder
the
and
usurp
his
dignities
and
these
histories
would
be
enacted
with
astonishing
realism
chiefly
by
frank
himself
with
the
help
of
a
zealous
friend
or
two
who
were
content
to
obey
and
these
were
all
over
now
and
that
was
the
very
door
through
which
the
was
accustomed
to
escape
from
his
assassins
jack
sighed
again
passed
through
picked
up
the
parcel
of
clothes
that
lay
in
the
unhitched
the
hammock
in
which
frank
had
slept
last
night
he
noticed
the
ends
of
three
cigarettes
placed
on
the
cover
of
a
convenient
and
went
off
resembling
a
jillings
sniffed
again
as
she
looked
after
him
up
the
court
she
did
understand
those
young
gentlemen
at
all
and
frequently
said
so
vi
at
six
that
morning
about
the
time
that
jack
awoke
in
cambridge
john
harris
laborer
emerged
very
sleepy
and
frowsy
for
he
had
sat
up
late
last
night
at
the
spotted
dog
from
the
door
of
a
small
cottage
on
the
ely
road
in
the
middle
of
grunty
fen
he
looked
this
way
and
that
wondering
whether
it
were
as
late
as
his
informed
him
and
observing
the
sun
that
hung
now
lamentably
high
up
in
that
enormous
dome
of
summer
sky
that
sat
on
the
fenland
like
a
on
a
dish
and
as
he
turned
southwards
he
became
aware
of
a
young
gentleman
carrying
a
in
one
hand
and
a
gray
jacket
over
his
other
arm
coming
up
to
him
not
twenty
yards
away
as
he
came
nearer
harris
noticed
that
his
face
was
badly
bruised
as
by
a
blow
good
morning
said
the
young
gentleman
hot
work
john
harris
made
some
observation
i
want
some
work
to
do
said
the
young
gentleman
disregarding
the
observation
i
willing
and
capable
do
you
know
of
any
i
mean
work
that
i
shall
be
paid
for
or
perhaps
some
breakfast
would
do
as
a
beginning
john
harris
regarded
the
young
gentleman
in
silence
chapter
ii
i
merefield
court
as
every
tourist
knows
may
be
viewed
from
ten
to
five
on
tuesdays
and
thursdays
when
the
family
are
not
in
residence
and
on
tuesdays
only
from
two
to
four
when
they
are
it
is
unnecessary
therefore
to
describe
it
very
closely
it
stands
very
nearly
on
the
top
of
a
hill
protected
by
woods
from
the
north
winds
of
yorkshire
and
its
towers
and
pinnacles
can
be
seen
from
ten
miles
away
down
the
valley
it
is
built
architecturally
considered
in
the
form
of
an
irregular
triangular
court
quite
unique
with
the
old
barbican
at
the
lower
end
the
chapel
wing
directly
opposite
the
ruins
of
the
old
castle
on
the
left
keep
and
all
and
the
new
house
that
is
actually
lived
in
on
the
right
it
is
of
every
conceivable
date
the
housekeeper
will
supply
details
from
the
british
mound
on
which
the
keep
stands
to
the
georgian
built
by
the
grandfather
of
the
present
earl
but
the
main
body
of
the
house
with
which
we
are
principally
concerned
the
long
gray
pile
facing
south
down
to
the
lake
and
northwards
into
the
court
is
jacobean
down
to
the
smallest
detail
and
extremely
good
at
that
it
was
on
the
end
of
this
that
the
thirteenth
earl
the
fifteenth
baron
and
the
fourteenth
viscount
one
man
not
three
thought
it
proper
to
build
on
a
palladian
kind
of
of
red
sandstone
brought
at
enormous
cost
from
half
across
england
fortunately
however
ivy
has
since
covered
the
greater
part
of
its
exterior
it
was
in
this
room
also
used
as
a
that
archie
guiseley
viscount
merefield
and
dick
guiseley
his
first
cousin
first
heard
the
news
of
frank
intentions
they
were
both
dressed
for
dinner
and
were
knocking
the
balls
about
for
ten
minutes
waiting
for
the
gong
and
they
were
talking
in
that
incoherent
way
characteristic
of
the
governor
not
very
well
again
observed
archie
and
the
doctor
wo
let
him
go
up
to
town
that
why
we
here
dick
missed
a
difficult
cannon
he
had
only
arrived
from
town
himself
by
the
and
began
to
chalk
his
cue
very
carefully
there
nothing
whatever
to
do
continued
archie
so
i
warn
you
dick
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
and
closed
it
again
pursing
it
up
precisely
as
once
more
he
addressed
himself
to
the
balls
and
this
time
brought
off
a
really
brilliant
stroke
and
he
in
a
terrible
way
about
frank
continued
the
other
heard
all
about
that
dick
nodded
and
he
swears
he
wo
have
him
home
again
and
that
he
can
go
to
the
devil
dick
arched
his
eyebrows
interrogatively
of
course
he
does
mean
it
but
the
gout
you
know
and
all
that
i
think
frank
had
better
keep
out
of
the
way
though
for
a
bit
oh
by
the
way
the
rector
and
jenny
are
coming
to
dinner
what
does
jenny
say
to
it
all
asked
dick
gently
oh
jenny
laughs
these
two
young
men
for
archie
was
only
and
dick
a
year
or
two
older
were
quite
remarkably
like
one
another
in
manner
and
general
bearing
each
though
their
faces
were
entirely
different
wore
that
same
particular
form
of
mask
that
is
fashionable
just
now
each
had
a
look
in
his
eyes
as
if
the
blinds
were
down
rather
insolent
and
yet
rather
pleasant
each
moved
in
the
same
kind
of
way
slow
and
deliberate
each
spoke
quietly
on
rather
a
low
note
and
used
as
few
words
as
possible
each
just
now
wore
a
short
braided
of
precisely
the
same
cut
for
the
rest
they
were
quite
unlike
archie
was
of
a
medium
sort
of
complexion
with
a
big
chin
and
rather
loosely
built
dick
wore
a
small
pointed
brown
beard
and
was
neat
and
alert
neither
of
them
did
anything
particular
in
the
world
archie
was
more
or
less
tied
to
his
father
except
in
the
autumn
for
archie
drew
the
line
at
homburg
and
went
about
for
short
visits
returning
continually
to
look
after
the
estate
dick
lived
in
a
flat
in
town
on
six
hundred
a
year
allowed
him
by
his
mother
and
was
supposed
to
be
a
sort
of
solicitor
they
saw
a
good
deal
of
one
another
off
and
on
and
got
on
together
rather
better
than
most
brothers
certainly
better
than
did
archie
and
frank
it
was
thought
a
pity
by
a
good
many
people
that
they
were
only
cousins
then
as
they
gossiped
gently
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
a
girl
came
in
she
was
a
very
striking
girl
indeed
and
her
beauty
was
increased
just
now
by
obvious
excitement
held
well
in
check
she
was
tall
and
very
fair
and
carried
herself
superbly
looking
taller
than
she
really
was
her
eyes
particularly
bright
just
now
were
of
a
vivid
blue
and
well
set
in
her
face
her
mouth
was
strong
and
sensible
and
there
was
a
glorious
air
of
breeziness
and
health
about
her
altogether
she
was
in
evening
dress
and
wore
a
light
cloak
over
her
white
shoulders
i
sorry
to
interrupt
she
said
oh
good
evening
mr
dick
but
there
something
wrong
clarkson
ran
out
to
tell
us
that
lord
talgarth
it
a
telegram
or
something
father
sent
me
to
tell
you
archie
looked
at
her
a
second
then
he
was
gone
swiftly
but
not
hurriedly
the
girl
turned
to
dick
i
afraid
it
something
about
frank
she
said
i
heard
clarkson
mention
his
name
to
father
is
there
any
more
news
dick
laid
down
his
cue
across
the
table
i
only
came
an
hour
ago
he
said
archie
was
telling
me
just
now
jenny
went
across
to
the
deep
chair
on
the
hearth
threw
off
her
cloak
and
sat
down
lord
talgarth
well
if
he
was
my
father
i
should
say
he
was
in
a
passion
i
heard
his
voice
she
smiled
a
little
dick
leaned
against
the
table
looking
at
her
poor
frank
he
said
she
smiled
again
more
freely
yes
poor
dear
frank
he
always
in
hot
water
is
he
i
afraid
it
serious
this
time
observed
dick
what
did
he
want
to
become
a
catholic
for
oh
frank
always
unexpected
yes
i
know
but
this
happens
to
be
just
the
one
very
thing
she
looked
at
him
humorously
do
you
know
i
no
notion
that
lord
talgarth
was
so
deeply
religious
until
frank
became
a
catholic
yes
i
know
said
dick
but
it
is
just
his
one
obsession
frank
must
have
known
that
and
i
not
the
slightest
doubt
said
jenny
that
that
was
an
additional
reason
for
his
doing
it
well
what
happen
she
jerked
her
head
a
little
oh
it
pass
off
you
see
frank
find
out
and
then
we
shall
all
be
happy
ever
afterwards
but
meantime
oh
frank
go
and
stay
with
friends
a
month
or
two
i
daresay
come
to
the
kirkbys
and
i
can
go
and
see
him
suppose
he
does
something
violent
he
quite
capable
of
it
oh
i
shall
talk
to
him
it
be
all
right
i
very
sensible
indeed
you
know
all
my
friends
tell
me
that
dick
was
silent
do
you
think
so
think
what
that
i
very
sensible
dick
made
a
little
movement
with
his
head
oh
i
suppose
so
yes
i
daresay
and
suppose
my
uncle
cuts
him
off
with
a
shilling
he
quite
capable
of
it
he
a
very
heavy
father
you
know
he
wo
i
shall
talk
to
him
too
yes
but
suppose
he
does
she
threw
him
a
swift
glance
frank
put
the
shilling
on
his
after
it
been
shown
with
all
the
other
what
are
you
going
to
give
me
mr
dick
i
shall
design
a
piece
of
emblematic
jewelry
said
dick
very
gravely
when
the
wedding
to
be
well
we
had
settled
lord
talgarth
would
make
up
his
mind
i
suppose
next
summer
some
time
miss
jenny
yes
tell
me
quite
seriously
what
you
do
if
there
was
a
real
row
a
permanent
one
i
mean
between
frank
and
my
uncle
dear
dick
do
talk
so
absurdly
i
tell
you
there
not
going
to
be
a
row
i
going
to
see
to
that
myself
but
suppose
there
was
jenny
stood
up
abruptly
i
tell
you
i
a
very
sensible
person
and
i
not
going
to
imagine
absurdities
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
do
you
want
me
to
strike
an
attitude
and
talk
about
love
in
a
cottage
well
that
would
be
one
answer
very
well
then
that
do
wo
it
you
can
take
it
as
said
going
to
see
what
happening
but
as
she
went
to
the
door
there
came
footsteps
and
voices
outside
and
the
next
moment
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
lord
talgarth
followed
by
his
son
and
the
rector
burst
into
the
room
ii
i
am
very
sorry
to
have
to
say
it
but
the
thirteenth
earl
of
talgarth
was
exactly
like
a
man
in
a
book
and
not
a
very
good
book
his
character
was
so
to
speak
cut
out
of
cardboard
stiff
cardboard
and
highly
colored
with
gilt
edges
showing
here
and
there
he
also
as
has
been
said
resembled
a
nobleman
on
the
stage
of
the
adelphi
he
had
a
handsome
inflamed
face
with
an
aquiline
nose
and
white
eyebrows
that
moved
up
and
down
and
all
the
other
things
he
was
stout
and
tall
suffered
from
the
gout
and
carried
with
him
in
the
house
a
black
stick
with
an
pad
on
the
end
there
were
no
shades
about
him
at
all
construct
a
conventionally
theatrical
heavy
father
of
noble
family
and
you
have
lord
talgarth
to
the
life
there
really
are
people
like
this
in
the
world
of
whom
too
one
can
prophesy
with
tolerable
certainty
how
they
will
behave
in
any
given
situation
certainly
lord
talgarth
was
behaving
in
character
now
he
had
received
meek
mackintosh
deferential
telegram
occupying
several
sheets
informing
him
that
his
son
had
held
an
auction
of
all
his
belongings
and
had
proposed
to
take
to
the
roads
asking
also
for
instructions
as
to
how
to
deal
with
him
and
the
hint
of
defiant
obstinacy
on
the
part
of
frank
the
fact
indeed
that
he
had
taken
his
father
at
his
word
had
thrown
that
father
into
a
yet
more
violent
fit
of
passion
jenny
had
heard
him
spluttering
and
exclamatory
with
anger
as
she
came
into
the
hall
the
telegram
had
but
that
instant
been
put
into
his
hands
and
even
now
the
footmen
still
a
little
pale
were
exchanging
winks
in
the
hall
outside
while
clarkson
his
valet
and
the
butler
stood
in
high
and
subdued
conference
a
little
way
off
what
lord
talgarth
would
really
have
wished
was
that
frank
should
have
written
to
him
a
submissive
even
though
a
disobedient
letter
telling
him
that
he
could
not
forego
his
convictions
and
preparing
to
assume
the
of
a
christian
martyr
for
he
could
have
sneered
at
this
and
after
suitable
discipline
forgiven
its
writer
more
or
less
of
course
he
had
never
intended
for
one
instant
that
his
threats
should
really
be
carried
out
but
the
situation
to
one
of
lord
temperament
demanded
that
the
threats
should
be
made
and
that
frank
should
pretend
to
be
crushed
by
them
that
the
boy
should
have
behaved
like
this
brought
a
reality
of
passion
into
the
affair
disconcerting
and
infuriating
as
if
an
actor
should
find
his
enemy
on
the
stage
was
armed
with
a
real
sword
there
was
but
one
possibility
left
which
lord
talgarth
instinctively
rather
than
consciously
grasped
at
namely
that
an
increased
fury
on
his
part
should
once
more
bring
realities
back
again
to
a
melodramatic
level
and
leave
himself
as
father
master
both
of
the
situation
and
of
his
most
disconcerting
son
frank
had
behaved
like
this
in
minor
matters
once
or
twice
before
and
lord
talgarth
had
always
come
off
victor
after
all
he
commanded
all
the
accessories
when
the
speeches
had
been
made
frank
cut
off
with
a
shilling
driven
to
the
colonies
brought
back
again
and
finally
starved
to
death
at
his
father
gates
lord
talgarth
found
himself
in
a
chair
with
jenny
seated
opposite
and
the
rest
of
the
company
gone
to
dinner
he
did
not
quite
realize
how
it
had
all
been
brought
about
nor
by
whose
arrangement
it
was
that
a
plate
of
soup
and
some
fish
were
to
come
presently
and
jenny
and
he
to
dine
together
he
pulled
himself
together
a
little
however
and
began
to
use
phrases
again
about
his
graceless
son
and
the
young
villain
and
not
a
penny
of
his
he
was
of
course
genuinely
angry
that
must
be
understood
then
jenny
began
to
talk
i
think
you
know
she
said
quietly
that
you
are
going
the
right
way
to
work
it
very
impertinent
of
me
is
it
but
you
did
say
just
now
you
wanted
to
hear
what
i
thought
of
course
i
do
of
course
i
do
you
a
sensible
girl
my
dear
always
said
that
but
as
for
this
young
well
let
me
say
what
i
think
yes
put
the
soup
down
here
will
you
is
that
right
lord
talgarth
she
waited
till
the
man
was
gone
again
and
the
old
man
had
taken
up
his
spoon
then
she
took
up
her
own
well
i
think
what
you
done
is
exactly
the
thing
to
make
frank
more
obstinate
than
ever
you
see
i
know
him
very
well
now
if
you
only
laughed
at
him
and
patted
his
head
so
to
speak
from
the
beginning
and
told
him
you
thought
it
an
excellent
thing
for
a
boy
of
his
character
who
wants
looking
after
lord
talgarth
glared
at
her
he
was
still
breathing
rather
heavily
and
was
making
something
of
a
noise
over
his
soup
but
how
can
i
say
that
when
i
think
oh
you
ca
say
it
now
of
course
it
too
late
no
that
would
never
do
you
must
keep
it
up
only
you
must
be
really
angry
why
not
try
a
little
cold
severity
she
looked
so
charming
and
humorous
that
the
old
man
began
to
melt
a
little
he
glanced
up
at
her
once
or
twice
under
his
heavy
eyebrows
i
wonder
what
you
do
he
said
with
a
kind
of
gruffness
when
you
find
you
got
to
marry
a
pauper
i
sha
have
to
marry
a
pauper
said
jenny
that
would
do
either
oh
you
counting
on
that
eight
hundred
a
year
still
are
you
jenny
allowed
a
little
coldness
to
appear
on
her
face
rude
banter
was
all
very
well
but
it
must
go
too
far
secretly
she
allowed
to
herself
sometimes
that
this
old
man
had
elements
of
the
cad
in
his
character
that
entirely
my
own
affair
she
said
and
frank
lord
talgarth
blazed
up
a
little
and
the
eight
hundred
a
year
is
mine
he
said
jenny
laid
down
her
spoon
as
the
servant
reappeared
with
the
fish
and
the
he
came
very
opportunely
and
while
her
host
was
considering
what
he
would
eat
next
she
was
pondering
her
next
move
jenny
as
has
been
said
was
an
exceedingly
sensible
girl
she
had
grown
up
in
the
rectory
down
at
the
park
gates
and
since
her
mother
death
three
years
previously
had
managed
her
father
house
including
her
father
with
great
success
she
had
begun
to
extend
her
influence
for
the
last
year
or
two
even
over
the
formidable
lord
of
the
manor
himself
and
as
has
been
seen
was
engaged
to
his
son
her
judgment
was
usually
very
sound
and
very
sane
and
the
two
men
with
the
rector
had
been
perfectly
right
just
now
in
leaving
the
old
man
to
her
care
for
an
hour
or
so
if
anything
could
quiet
him
it
would
be
this
girl
she
was
quite
fearless
quite
dignified
and
quite
able
to
hold
her
own
and
her
father
perceived
that
she
rather
enjoyed
it
when
the
man
had
gone
out
again
she
resumed
well
let
leave
it
she
said
for
a
day
or
two
there
no
hurry
and
but
i
must
answer
this
this
telegram
he
growled
what
am
i
to
say
to
the
feller
tell
him
to
follow
his
discretion
and
that
you
have
complete
confidence
but
yes
i
know
you
have
really
but
it
do
no
harm
and
it
make
him
feel
important
and
what
if
the
boy
does
take
to
the
roads
let
him
said
jenny
coolly
it
wo
kill
him
he
looked
up
at
her
again
in
silence
jenny
herself
was
very
far
from
comfortable
though
she
was
conscious
of
real
pleasure
too
in
the
situation
she
had
seen
this
old
man
in
a
passion
pretty
often
but
she
had
never
seen
him
in
a
passion
with
any
real
excuse
no
one
ever
thwarted
him
he
even
decided
where
his
doctor
should
send
him
for
his
cure
and
in
what
month
and
for
how
long
and
she
was
not
therefore
quite
certain
what
would
happen
for
she
knew
frank
well
enough
to
be
quite
sure
that
he
meant
what
he
said
however
she
reflected
the
main
thing
at
present
was
to
smooth
things
down
all
round
as
far
as
possible
then
she
could
judge
ca
make
out
why
you
ever
consented
to
marry
such
a
chap
at
all
he
growled
presently
oh
well
said
jenny
iii
it
was
a
delicious
evening
and
the
three
men
after
dinner
strolled
out
on
to
the
broad
terrace
that
ran
looking
over
the
lake
straight
up
and
down
the
long
side
of
the
house
they
had
not
had
the
advantage
since
the
servants
were
in
the
room
of
talking
over
the
situation
as
they
wished
and
there
was
no
knowing
when
lord
talgarth
and
jenny
might
emerge
so
they
sat
down
at
a
little
stone
table
at
the
end
furthest
from
the
and
archie
and
dick
lit
their
cigarettes
there
is
not
a
great
deal
to
say
about
the
rector
the
most
effective
fact
about
him
was
that
he
was
the
father
of
jenny
it
was
a
case
here
of
averill
following
averill
his
father
and
grandfather
both
second
sons
as
was
the
rector
himself
had
held
the
living
before
him
and
had
performed
the
duties
of
it
in
the
traditional
and
perfectly
respectable
way
this
one
was
a
quiet
man
except
for
two
small
whiskers
he
wore
a
white
tie
and
a
small
gold
stud
was
visible
in
the
long
slit
of
his
white
he
was
on
very
easy
terms
in
this
house
in
an
unintimate
manner
and
dined
here
once
a
fortnight
or
so
without
saying
or
hearing
anything
of
particular
interest
he
had
been
secretly
delighted
at
his
daughter
engagement
and
had
given
his
consent
with
gentle
and
reserved
cordiality
he
was
a
tory
not
exactly
by
choice
but
simply
for
the
same
reason
as
he
was
church
of
england
because
he
was
unable
in
the
fiber
of
him
to
imagine
anything
else
of
course
lord
talgarth
was
the
principal
personage
in
his
world
simply
because
he
was
lord
talgarth
and
owned
practically
the
whole
parish
and
of
the
next
he
regarded
his
daughter
with
the
greatest
respect
and
left
in
her
hands
everything
that
he
decently
could
and
to
do
her
justice
jenny
was
a
very
benevolent
as
well
as
capable
despot
in
short
the
rector
plays
no
great
part
in
this
drama
beyond
that
of
a
discreet
and
mostly
silent
greek
chorus
of
unimpeachable
character
he
disapproved
deeply
of
course
of
change
of
religion
but
he
disapproved
with
that
same
part
of
him
that
appreciated
lord
talgarth
it
seemed
to
him
that
catholicism
in
his
daughter
future
husband
was
a
defect
of
the
same
kind
as
would
be
a
wooden
leg
or
an
unpleasant
habit
of
sniffing
a
drawback
yet
not
insuperable
he
would
be
considerably
relieved
if
it
could
be
cured
the
three
men
sat
there
for
some
while
without
interruption
from
the
while
the
evening
breeze
died
the
rosy
sky
paled
and
the
stars
came
out
one
by
one
like
diamonds
in
the
clear
blue
they
said
of
course
all
the
proper
things
and
dick
heard
a
little
more
than
he
had
previously
known
dick
was
always
conscious
of
a
faint
almost
impersonal
resentment
against
destiny
when
he
stayed
at
merefield
it
was
obvious
to
him
that
the
position
of
heir
there
was
one
which
would
exactly
have
suited
his
tastes
and
temperament
he
was
extremely
pleased
to
belong
to
the
family
and
it
was
indeed
a
very
exceptional
family
as
regards
history
it
had
been
represented
in
nearly
every
catastrophe
since
the
norman
conquest
and
always
on
the
winning
side
except
once
but
it
was
difficult
to
enjoy
the
distinction
as
it
deserved
living
as
he
did
in
a
flat
in
london
all
by
himself
when
his
name
was
mentioned
to
a
stranger
it
was
always
greeted
by
the
question
as
to
whether
he
was
one
of
the
guiseleys
of
merefield
and
it
seemed
to
him
singularly
annoying
that
he
could
only
answer
first
cousin
archie
of
course
was
a
satisfactory
heir
there
was
no
question
of
that
he
was
completely
of
dick
own
school
of
manner
but
it
seemed
a
kind
of
outrage
that
frank
with
his
violent
convictions
and
his
escapades
should
be
archie
only
brother
there
was
little
of
that
repose
about
him
that
a
guiseley
needed
it
would
be
about
nine
that
the
sound
of
an
opening
door
and
voices
from
the
further
end
of
the
terrace
told
them
that
the
conference
was
over
and
they
stood
up
as
jenny
very
upright
and
pale
in
the
twilight
with
her
host
at
her
side
came
up
towards
them
dick
noticed
that
the
cigar
his
uncle
carried
was
smoked
down
almost
to
the
butt
and
augured
well
from
that
detail
the
old
man
arm
was
in
the
girl
and
he
supported
himself
on
the
other
side
limping
a
little
on
his
black
stick
he
sat
down
with
a
grunt
and
laid
his
stick
across
the
table
well
boys
we
settled
it
he
said
jenny
to
write
the
telegram
no
one
need
be
anxious
any
more
announced
jenny
imperturbably
lord
talgarth
extremely
angry
still
as
he
has
every
right
to
be
and
frank
going
to
be
allowed
to
go
on
the
tramp
if
he
wants
to
the
rector
waited
in
deferential
silence
for
corroboration
jenny
a
very
sensible
girl
observed
lord
talgarth
and
what
she
says
is
quite
right
do
you
mean
to
say
began
archie
the
old
man
frowned
round
at
him
all
that
i
said
holds
good
he
said
frank
made
his
bed
and
he
must
lie
on
it
i
warned
him
and
jenny
sees
that
too
archie
glanced
at
the
girl
and
dick
looked
hard
at
her
straight
into
her
face
but
there
was
absolutely
no
sign
there
of
any
perturbation
certainly
she
looked
white
in
the
falling
dusk
but
her
eyes
were
merry
and
steadfast
and
her
voice
perfectly
natural
that
how
we
settled
it
she
said
and
if
i
satisfied
i
imagine
everyone
else
ought
to
be
and
i
going
to
write
frank
a
good
long
letter
all
by
myself
come
along
father
we
must
be
going
lord
talgarth
is
well
and
we
must
keep
him
up
iv
when
the
last
game
of
billiards
had
been
played
and
whisky
had
been
drunk
and
archie
had
taken
up
his
candle
dick
stood
still
with
his
own
in
his
hand
are
you
coming
said
archie
dick
paused
i
think
i
smoke
one
more
cigarette
on
the
terrace
he
said
it
a
heavenly
night
and
i
want
to
get
the
taste
of
the
train
out
of
my
mouth
all
right
then
lock
up
will
you
when
you
come
in
i
off
it
was
indeed
a
heavenly
night
behind
him
as
he
sat
at
the
table
where
they
had
had
coffee
the
great
house
shimmered
pale
in
the
summer
twilight
broken
here
by
a
line
or
two
of
yellow
light
behind
shuttered
windows
here
with
the
big
oriel
window
of
the
hall
blazing
with
coats
fully
illuminated
he
must
remember
he
thought
to
put
out
the
lights
there
as
he
went
to
bed
and
about
him
was
the
great
soft
darkness
roofed
in
by
the
sky
alight
with
stars
and
beneath
him
in
the
valley
he
could
catch
the
glimmer
of
the
big
lake
and
the
blotted
masses
of
pine
and
cypress
black
against
it
it
was
here
then
under
these
circumstances
that
dick
confessed
to
himself
frankly
and
openly
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
in
love
with
jenny
launton
he
had
known
her
for
years
off
and
on
and
had
thought
of
her
as
a
pretty
girl
and
a
pleasant
companion
he
had
skated
with
her
ridden
with
her
danced
with
her
and
had
only
understood
with
a
sense
of
mild
shock
at
the
time
of
her
engagement
to
frank
six
months
before
that
she
was
of
an
age
to
become
a
wife
to
someone
that
had
been
the
beginning
of
a
process
which
culminated
as
he
now
understood
perfectly
its
next
step
had
been
a
vague
wonder
why
archie
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
himself
and
he
had
explained
it
by
saying
that
archie
had
too
great
a
sense
of
his
own
importance
to
permit
himself
to
marry
a
rector
daughter
with
only
a
couple
of
hundred
a
year
of
her
own
and
in
this
explanation
i
think
he
was
quite
correct
then
he
had
begun
to
think
of
her
himself
a
good
deal
dramatically
rather
than
realistically
wondering
what
it
would
feel
like
to
be
engaged
to
her
if
a
younger
son
could
marry
her
surely
a
first
cousin
could
even
of
the
guiseleys
so
it
had
gone
on
little
by
little
he
had
danced
with
her
here
at
christmas
just
after
the
engagement
and
had
stayed
on
a
week
longer
than
he
had
intended
he
had
come
up
again
at
easter
and
again
at
whitsuntide
though
he
always
protested
to
his
friends
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
at
merefield
in
the
summer
and
now
here
he
was
again
and
the
thing
had
happened
at
first
as
he
sat
here
he
tried
to
analyze
his
attitude
to
frank
he
had
never
approved
of
frank
altogether
he
did
quite
like
the
queer
kinds
of
things
that
frank
did
for
frank
reputation
at
merefield
was
very
much
what
it
was
at
cambridge
he
did
ridiculous
and
undignified
things
as
a
small
boy
he
had
fought
at
least
three
pitched
battles
in
the
village
and
that
was
not
a
proper
thing
for
a
guiseley
to
do
he
liked
to
go
out
with
the
keepers
after
poachers
and
dick
very
properly
asked
himself
what
keepers
were
for
except
to
do
that
kind
of
thing
for
you
there
had
been
a
bad
row
here
too
scarcely
eighteen
months
ago
it
had
been
something
to
do
with
a
horse
that
was
and
frank
had
cut
a
very
absurd
and
ridiculous
figure
getting
hot
and
angry
and
finally
thrashing
a
groom
or
somebody
with
his
own
hands
and
there
had
been
uncomfortable
talk
about
and
actions
for
assault
finally
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
proposed
to
and
become
engaged
to
jenny
launton
that
was
an
improper
thing
for
a
younger
son
to
do
anyhow
at
his
age
and
dick
now
perceived
that
the
fact
that
jenny
was
jenny
aggravated
the
offense
a
hundredfold
and
last
of
all
he
had
become
a
catholic
an
act
of
enthusiasm
which
seemed
to
dick
really
vulgar
altogether
then
frank
was
not
a
satisfactory
person
and
it
would
do
him
no
harm
to
have
a
little
real
discipline
at
last
it
was
the
striking
of
midnight
from
the
stable
clock
that
woke
dick
up
from
his
deep
reverie
and
was
the
occasion
of
his
perceiving
that
he
had
come
to
no
conclusion
about
anything
except
that
frank
was
an
ass
that
jenny
was
well
jenny
and
that
he
dick
was
an
person
i
do
not
like
to
set
down
here
even
if
i
could
all
the
considerations
that
had
passed
through
dick
mind
since
a
eleven
simply
because
the
very
statement
of
them
would
give
a
false
impression
dick
was
not
a
knave
and
he
did
not
deceive
himself
about
himself
more
than
most
of
us
do
yet
he
had
considered
a
number
of
points
that
strictly
speaking
he
ought
not
to
have
considered
he
had
wondered
whether
frank
would
die
he
had
wondered
whether
if
he
did
not
lord
talgarth
would
really
be
as
good
as
his
word
and
if
so
what
effect
that
would
have
on
jenny
finally
he
had
wondered
with
a
good
deal
of
intellectual
application
what
exactly
jenny
had
meant
when
she
had
announced
all
that
about
the
telegram
she
was
going
to
send
in
lord
talgarth
name
and
the
letter
she
was
going
to
send
in
her
own
he
had
asked
archie
just
now
in
the
and
he
too
had
confessed
himself
beaten
only
he
had
been
quite
sure
that
jenny
would
get
her
way
and
obtain
frank
forgiveness
also
in
the
course
of
his
of
an
hour
he
had
considered
for
perhaps
the
hundredth
time
since
he
had
come
to
the
age
of
discretion
what
exactly
three
lives
between
a
man
and
a
title
stood
for
lord
talgarth
was
old
and
gouty
archie
was
not
married
and
showed
no
signs
of
it
and
frank
well
frank
was
always
adventurous
and
always
in
trouble
well
i
have
set
down
the
points
after
all
but
it
must
not
be
thought
that
the
gentleman
with
the
pointed
brown
beard
and
thoughtful
eyes
who
at
five
minutes
past
twelve
went
up
the
two
steps
into
the
locked
the
doors
as
he
had
been
directed
took
up
his
candle
and
went
to
bed
went
with
an
uneasy
conscience
or
in
fact
was
a
villain
in
any
way
whatever
chapter
iii
i
the
first
spot
in
frank
pilgrimage
which
i
have
been
able
to
visit
and
identify
in
such
a
way
that
i
am
able
to
form
to
myself
a
picture
of
his
adventure
more
or
less
complete
in
all
its
parts
lies
about
ten
miles
of
doncaster
in
a
little
valley
where
curiously
enough
another
pilgrim
named
richard
lived
for
a
little
while
nearly
six
hundred
years
ago
up
to
the
time
of
frank
coming
there
in
the
season
of
numberless
little
incidents
of
his
experience
stand
out
vivid
indeed
but
fragmentary
yet
they
do
not
form
to
my
mind
a
coherent
whole
i
think
i
understand
to
some
extent
the
process
by
which
he
became
accustomed
to
ordinary
physical
hard
living
into
which
the
initiation
began
with
his
series
of
almost
wholly
sleepless
nights
and
heavy
days
night
was
too
strange
in
barns
beneath
in
little
oppressive
rooms
in
for
him
to
sleep
easily
at
first
and
between
his
tramps
or
in
the
when
he
managed
to
get
work
he
would
drop
off
in
the
hot
sunshine
down
into
depths
of
that
kind
of
rest
that
is
like
the
sea
itself
glimmering
gulfs
lit
by
glimpses
of
consciousness
of
the
grass
beneath
his
cheek
the
bubble
of
in
the
copses
stretching
down
into
profound
and
utter
darkness
of
how
the
little
happenings
of
every
day
wore
themselves
into
a
coherent
whole
and
modified
not
indeed
himself
but
his
manner
of
life
and
his
experience
and
knowledge
i
can
make
no
real
picture
at
all
the
first
of
these
took
place
within
ten
miles
of
cambridge
on
his
first
morning
and
resulted
in
the
bruised
face
which
harris
noticed
it
concerned
a
piece
of
brutality
to
a
dog
in
which
frank
interfered
he
was
extraordinarily
tender
to
animals
then
there
was
the
learning
as
to
how
work
was
obtained
and
even
more
considerable
the
doing
of
the
work
the
amateur
as
frank
pointed
out
later
began
too
vigorously
and
became
exhausted
the
professional
set
out
with
the
same
deliberation
with
which
he
ended
one
must
not
run
at
one
spade
or
hoe
or
whatever
it
was
one
must
exercise
a
wearisome
survey
the
work
to
be
done
turn
slowly
spit
on
one
hands
and
after
a
pause
begin
remembering
that
the
same
activity
must
show
itself
if
the
work
was
to
be
renewed
next
day
up
to
the
moment
of
leaving
off
then
there
was
the
need
of
becoming
accustomed
to
an
entirely
different
kind
of
food
eaten
in
an
entirely
different
way
and
under
entirely
different
circumstances
there
was
experience
to
be
gained
as
to
washing
clothes
i
can
almost
see
frank
now
by
a
certain
kind
of
stream
stripped
to
the
waist
waiting
while
his
shirt
dried
smoking
an
cigarette
yet
alert
for
the
gamekeeper
above
all
there
was
an
immense
volume
of
learning
or
rather
a
training
of
instinct
to
be
gained
respecting
human
nature
a
knowledge
of
the
kind
of
man
who
would
give
work
the
kind
of
man
who
meant
what
he
said
and
the
kind
of
man
who
did
not
the
kind
of
woman
who
would
threaten
the
police
if
milk
or
bread
were
asked
for
frank
learned
to
beg
very
quickly
the
kind
of
woman
who
would
add
twopence
and
tell
him
to
be
off
and
the
kind
of
woman
who
after
a
pause
and
a
slow
scrutiny
would
deliberately
refuse
to
supply
a
glass
of
water
then
there
was
the
atmosphere
of
the
little
towns
to
be
learned
the
intolerable
weariness
of
pavements
and
the
patient
persistence
of
policemen
who
would
not
allow
you
to
sit
down
he
discovered
also
during
his
wanderings
the
universal
fact
that
policemen
are
usually
but
with
absolutely
no
sense
of
humor
whatever
he
learned
this
through
various
attempts
to
feign
that
the
policeman
was
in
costume
and
had
no
real
authority
he
learned
too
that
all
crimes
pale
before
resisting
the
police
in
the
execution
of
their
duty
then
he
had
to
learn
to
the
way
in
which
other
tramps
must
be
approached
the
silences
necessary
the
sort
of
questions
which
were
useless
the
jokes
that
must
be
laughed
at
and
the
jokes
that
must
be
resented
all
this
is
beyond
me
altogether
it
was
beyond
even
frank
own
powers
of
description
a
boy
coming
home
for
the
holidays
for
the
first
time
can
not
make
clear
to
his
mother
or
even
to
himself
what
it
is
that
has
so
utterly
changed
his
point
of
view
and
his
relations
towards
familiar
things
so
with
frank
he
could
draw
countless
little
vignettes
of
his
experiences
and
emotions
the
particular
sensation
elicited
for
example
by
seeing
through
iron
gates
happy
people
on
a
lawn
at
tea
the
white
china
the
silver
the
dresses
the
flannels
the
net
as
he
went
past
with
string
tied
below
his
knees
to
keep
off
the
drag
of
the
trousers
and
a
sore
heel
the
emotion
of
being
passed
by
a
boy
and
a
girl
on
horseback
the
flood
of
indescribable
associations
roused
by
walking
for
half
a
day
past
the
paling
of
a
great
park
with
here
and
there
the
cooing
of
and
the
big
house
among
its
lawns
and
cedars
and
seen
now
and
then
far
off
in
the
midst
but
what
he
could
not
describe
or
understand
was
the
inner
alchemy
by
which
this
new
relation
to
things
modified
his
own
soul
and
gave
him
a
point
of
view
utterly
new
and
bewildering
curiously
enough
however
as
it
seems
to
me
he
never
seriously
considered
the
possibility
of
abandoning
this
way
of
life
and
capitulating
to
his
father
a
number
of
things
i
suppose
inconceivable
to
myself
contributed
to
his
purpose
his
gipsy
blood
his
extraordinary
passion
for
romance
the
attraction
of
a
thing
simply
because
it
was
daring
and
unusual
and
finally
a
very
exceptionally
strong
will
that
for
myself
i
should
call
obstinacy
the
silence
as
regards
his
old
world
was
absolute
and
unbroken
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
by
now
letters
and
telegrams
must
be
waiting
for
him
at
jack
home
including
at
least
one
from
jenny
and
probably
a
dozen
but
as
to
jenny
he
knew
she
would
understand
and
as
to
the
rest
he
honestly
did
not
care
at
all
he
sent
her
a
picture
postcard
once
or
twice
from
ely
peterborough
sleaford
and
newark
towns
where
he
stayed
for
a
sunday
i
have
seen
in
sleaford
the
little
room
where
he
treated
himself
to
a
bed
for
two
nights
and
was
content
he
made
no
particular
plans
for
the
future
he
supposed
something
would
turn
up
and
he
settled
with
himself
by
the
help
of
that
same
will
which
i
have
mentioned
before
that
he
would
precipitate
no
conclusions
till
he
reached
barham
later
on
in
the
early
autumn
his
faith
and
morals
during
these
weeks
are
a
little
difficult
to
describe
as
regards
his
morals
at
least
in
one
particular
point
he
had
formulated
the
doctrine
that
when
he
was
very
hungry
game
might
not
be
touched
but
that
rabbits
and
birds
were
permissible
if
they
could
be
snared
in
the
hedges
of
the
he
became
an
expert
at
this
kind
of
thing
and
jack
has
described
to
me
as
taught
by
frank
a
few
devices
of
which
i
was
entirely
ignorant
frank
tramped
for
a
couple
of
days
with
a
gamekeeper
out
of
work
and
learned
these
things
from
him
as
well
as
one
or
two
simple
methods
of
cookery
as
regards
his
religion
i
think
i
had
better
not
say
much
just
now
very
curious
influences
were
at
work
upon
him
i
can
only
say
that
frank
himself
has
described
more
than
once
when
he
could
be
induced
to
talk
the
extraordinary
and
indeed
indescribable
thrill
with
which
he
saw
now
and
again
in
town
or
country
a
priest
in
his
vestments
go
to
the
altar
for
he
heard
mass
when
he
could
so
much
then
is
all
that
i
can
say
of
the
small
detached
experiences
that
he
passed
through
up
to
the
point
when
he
came
out
one
evening
at
sunset
from
one
of
the
fields
of
hampole
where
he
had
made
hay
all
day
when
his
job
was
finished
and
where
he
met
for
the
first
time
the
major
and
gertie
trustcott
ii
they
were
standing
with
the
sunset
light
behind
them
as
a
glory
two
disreputable
figures
such
as
one
sees
in
countless
thousands
along
all
the
of
england
in
the
summer
the
major
himself
was
a
lean
man
with
a
red
mustache
turning
gray
narrow
eyes
a
chin
and
very
square
jaw
shaved
about
two
days
previously
he
had
an
old
cricketing
cap
on
his
head
trousers
tied
up
with
string
like
frank
and
one
of
those
long
yellowish
coats
with
broad
such
as
a
gamekeeper
might
have
worn
twenty
years
ago
one
of
his
boots
was
badly
burst
and
he
seemed
to
rest
his
weight
by
preference
on
the
other
foot
he
was
not
prepossessing
but
frank
saw
with
his
experience
that
he
was
different
from
other
tramps
he
glanced
at
the
girl
and
saw
that
she
too
was
not
quite
of
the
regular
type
though
less
peculiar
than
her
companion
and
he
noticed
with
an
odd
touch
at
his
heart
that
she
had
certain
characteristics
in
common
with
jenny
she
was
not
so
tall
but
she
had
the
same
colored
hair
under
a
filthy
white
and
the
same
kind
of
blue
eyes
but
her
oval
face
again
was
weak
and
rather
miserable
they
were
both
deeply
sunburned
frank
had
learned
the
discretion
of
the
roads
by
now
and
did
no
more
than
jerk
his
head
almost
imperceptibly
as
he
went
past
he
proposed
to
go
back
to
the
farm
to
get
his
dwindled
belongings
as
the
job
was
over
and
to
move
on
a
few
miles
northward
before
sleeping
as
he
went
however
he
knew
that
the
man
had
turned
and
was
looking
after
him
but
he
made
no
sign
he
had
no
particular
desire
for
company
he
also
knew
by
instinct
practically
for
certain
that
these
two
were
neither
husband
and
wife
nor
father
and
daughter
the
type
was
obvious
i
say
sir
frank
turned
as
bucolically
as
he
could
i
say
sir
can
you
direct
this
lady
and
myself
to
a
lodging
frank
had
tried
to
cultivate
a
low
and
characterless
kind
of
voice
as
of
a
servant
or
a
groom
out
of
work
he
knew
he
could
never
learn
the
proper
accent
depends
on
what
kind
of
lodging
you
want
sir
what
suit
you
suit
us
said
the
major
genially
dropping
the
sir
i
going
further
sir
said
frank
i
done
my
job
here
the
major
turned
to
the
girl
and
frank
caught
the
words
what
say
gertie
there
was
a
murmur
of
talk
and
then
the
man
turned
to
him
again
if
you
no
objection
sir
we
come
with
you
my
good
lady
here
is
good
for
a
mile
or
two
more
she
says
and
we
like
some
company
frank
hesitated
he
did
not
in
the
least
wish
for
company
himself
he
glanced
at
the
girl
again
very
good
sir
he
said
then
if
you
wait
here
i
be
back
in
five
minutes
i
got
to
get
my
belongings
he
nodded
to
the
low
farm
buildings
in
the
valley
just
below
the
village
we
will
await
you
here
sir
said
the
major
magnificently
stroking
his
mustache
as
frank
came
back
up
the
little
hill
a
few
minutes
later
he
had
made
up
his
mind
as
to
what
to
say
and
do
it
was
his
first
experience
of
a
and
it
was
obvious
that
under
the
circumstances
he
could
not
pretend
to
be
anything
else
himself
but
he
was
perfectly
determined
not
to
tell
his
name
none
of
his
belongings
had
anything
more
than
his
initials
upon
them
and
he
decided
to
use
the
name
he
had
already
given
more
than
once
probably
they
would
not
go
far
together
but
it
was
worth
while
to
be
on
the
safe
side
he
came
straight
up
to
the
two
as
they
sat
side
by
side
with
their
feet
in
the
ditch
i
ready
sir
he
said
yes
you
spotted
me
all
right
university
man
and
public
school
boy
said
the
major
without
moving
eton
and
cambridge
said
frank
the
major
sprang
up
harrow
and
the
army
he
said
shake
hands
this
was
done
name
said
the
major
frank
grinned
i
have
my
card
with
me
he
said
but
frank
gregory
will
do
i
understand
said
the
major
and
major
will
do
for
me
it
has
the
advantage
of
being
true
and
this
lady
well
we
call
her
my
wife
frank
bowed
he
felt
he
was
acting
in
some
ridiculous
dream
but
his
sense
of
humor
saved
him
the
girl
gave
a
little
awkward
bow
in
response
and
dropped
her
eyes
certainly
she
was
very
like
jenny
and
very
unlike
and
a
name
asked
frank
we
may
as
well
have
one
in
case
of
difficulties
the
major
considered
what
do
you
say
to
trustcott
he
asked
will
that
do
perfectly
said
frank
major
and
trustcott
well
shall
we
be
going
frank
had
no
particular
views
as
to
lodgings
or
even
to
roads
so
long
as
the
direction
was
more
or
less
northward
he
was
aiming
generally
speaking
at
selby
and
york
and
it
seemed
that
this
would
suit
the
major
as
well
as
anything
else
there
is
i
believe
some
kind
of
routine
amongst
the
roadsters
and
about
that
time
of
the
year
most
of
them
are
as
far
afield
as
at
any
time
from
their
winter
quarters
the
major
and
trustcott
he
soon
learned
were
southerners
but
they
would
not
turn
homewards
for
another
three
months
yet
at
least
for
himself
he
had
no
ideas
beyond
a
general
intention
to
reach
barham
some
time
in
the
autumn
before
jack
went
back
to
cambridge
for
his
fourth
year
the
country
is
not
prepossessing
about
here
observed
the
major
presently
hampole
is
an
exception
frank
glanced
back
at
the
valley
they
were
leaving
it
had
indeed
an
extraordinarily
retired
and
rural
air
it
was
a
fertile
little
tract
of
ground
very
limited
and
circumscribed
and
the
rail
that
ran
through
it
was
the
only
sign
of
the
century
but
the
bright
air
was
a
little
dimmed
with
smoke
and
already
from
the
point
they
had
reached
tall
chimneys
began
to
prick
against
the
horizon
you
have
been
here
before
he
said
why
yes
and
about
this
time
last
year
was
it
gertie
i
understand
a
hermit
lived
here
once
a
hermit
might
almost
live
here
said
frank
you
are
right
sir
said
the
major
frank
began
to
wonder
as
he
walked
as
to
why
this
man
was
on
the
roads
curiously
enough
he
believed
his
statement
that
he
had
been
in
the
army
the
air
of
him
seemed
the
right
thing
a
militia
captain
would
have
swaggered
more
a
complete
impostor
would
have
given
more
details
frank
began
to
fish
for
information
you
have
been
long
on
the
roads
he
said
the
major
did
not
appear
to
hear
him
you
have
been
long
on
the
roads
persisted
frank
the
other
glanced
at
him
furtively
and
rather
insolently
the
younger
man
first
please
frank
smiled
oh
certainly
he
said
well
i
have
left
cambridge
at
the
end
of
june
only
ah
anything
disgraceful
you
wo
believe
me
i
suppose
if
i
say
oh
i
daresay
i
shall
well
then
then
may
i
ask
oh
yes
i
was
kicked
out
by
my
father
i
need
go
into
details
i
sold
up
my
things
and
came
out
that
all
and
you
mean
to
stick
to
it
certainly
at
least
for
a
year
or
two
that
all
right
well
then
major
what
did
we
say
trustcott
ah
yes
trustcott
well
then
i
think
we
might
add
hussars
that
near
enough
the
final
catastrophe
was
i
think
cards
not
that
i
cheated
you
understand
i
will
allow
no
man
to
say
that
of
me
but
that
was
what
was
said
a
gentleman
of
spirit
you
understand
could
not
remain
in
a
regiment
when
such
things
could
be
said
then
we
tumbled
downhill
and
i
been
at
this
for
four
years
and
you
know
sir
it
might
be
worse
frank
nodded
naturally
he
did
not
believe
as
necessarily
true
this
terse
little
story
and
he
was
absolutely
certain
that
if
cards
were
mixed
up
in
it
at
all
obviously
the
major
had
cheated
so
he
just
took
the
story
and
put
it
away
so
to
speak
it
was
to
form
he
perceived
the
understanding
on
which
they
consorted
together
then
he
began
to
wonder
about
the
girl
the
major
soon
supplied
a
further
form
and
trustcott
here
well
she
joined
me
let
us
say
rather
more
than
eighteen
months
ago
we
had
been
acquainted
before
that
however
that
was
when
i
was
consenting
to
serve
as
groom
to
some
er
some
jewish
bounder
in
town
trustcott
parents
live
in
town
the
girl
who
had
been
trudging
patiently
a
foot
or
two
behind
them
just
glanced
up
at
frank
and
down
again
he
wondered
exactly
what
her
own
attitude
was
to
all
this
but
she
made
no
comment
and
now
we
know
one
another
finished
the
major
in
a
tone
of
genial
finality
so
where
are
you
taking
us
er
mr
gregory
iii
they
were
fortunate
that
night
the
part
of
yorkshire
where
they
were
traveling
consists
chiefly
of
an
innumerable
quantity
of
little
cottages
gathered
for
the
most
part
round
collieries
one
has
the
impression
at
any
rate
from
a
motor
that
there
is
nothing
but
villages
but
that
is
not
a
fact
there
are
stretches
of
road
quite
solitary
at
certain
hours
and
in
one
of
these
they
noticed
presently
a
little
house
not
twenty
yards
from
the
road
once
obviously
forming
part
of
a
row
of
colliers
cottages
of
which
the
rest
were
demolished
it
was
not
far
off
from
ruin
itself
and
was
very
plainly
uninhabited
across
the
front
door
were
nailed
deal
props
originally
perhaps
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
it
barred
and
useful
for
holding
it
in
its
place
the
major
and
gertie
kept
watch
on
the
road
while
frank
pushed
open
the
crazy
little
gate
and
went
round
to
the
back
a
minute
later
he
called
to
them
softly
he
had
wrenched
open
the
back
door
and
within
in
the
darkness
they
could
make
out
a
little
kitchen
stripped
of
everything
table
furniture
and
even
the
range
itself
the
major
kicked
something
presently
in
the
gloom
swore
softly
and
announced
he
had
found
a
kettle
they
decided
that
all
this
would
do
very
well
tramps
do
not
demand
very
much
and
these
were
completely
contented
when
they
had
made
a
small
fire
damped
down
with
a
turf
to
prevent
it
smoking
had
boiled
a
little
water
stewed
some
tea
and
eaten
what
they
had
even
this
was
not
luxurious
the
major
produced
the
heel
of
a
cheese
and
two
bananas
and
frank
a
tin
of
sardines
and
a
small
stale
loaf
the
major
announced
presently
that
he
would
make
a
savory
and
indeed
with
cheese
melted
on
to
the
bread
and
sardines
on
the
top
he
did
very
well
gertie
moved
silently
about
and
frank
in
the
intervals
of
rather
abrupt
conversation
with
the
major
found
his
eyes
following
her
as
she
spread
out
their
small
possessions
vanished
up
the
stairs
and
reappeared
certainly
she
was
very
like
jenny
even
in
odd
little
details
the
line
of
her
eyebrows
the
angle
of
her
chin
and
so
forth
perhaps
more
in
these
details
than
in
anything
else
he
began
to
wonder
a
little
about
her
to
imagine
her
past
to
forecast
her
future
it
seemed
all
rather
sordid
she
disappeared
finally
without
a
word
he
heard
her
steps
overhead
and
then
silence
then
he
had
to
attend
to
the
major
a
little
more
it
was
easy
enough
to
tell
you
said
that
gentleman
how
oh
well
if
nothing
else
your
clothes
are
they
shabby
enough
the
major
eyed
him
with
lids
by
the
light
of
the
single
stuck
in
its
own
wax
on
the
mantelshelf
they
shabby
enough
but
they
the
wrong
sort
there
the
cut
first
though
that
does
settle
it
but
these
are
gray
flannel
trousers
for
one
thing
and
then
the
coat
not
stout
enough
they
might
have
been
given
me
said
frank
smiling
they
fit
you
too
well
for
that
i
change
them
when
i
get
a
chance
observed
frank
it
would
be
as
well
assented
the
major
somehow
or
another
the
sense
of
sordidness
which
presently
began
to
affect
frank
so
profoundly
descended
on
him
for
the
first
time
that
night
he
had
managed
by
his
very
solitariness
hitherto
to
escape
it
so
far
it
had
been
possible
to
keep
up
a
kind
of
pose
so
far
to
imagine
the
adventure
in
the
light
of
a
very
much
prolonged
and
very
realistic
picnic
but
with
this
other
man
the
thing
became
impossible
it
was
tolerable
to
wash
one
own
socks
it
was
not
so
tolerable
to
see
another
man
socks
hung
up
on
the
peeling
mantelpiece
a
foot
away
from
his
own
head
and
to
see
two
dirty
ankles
not
his
own
emerging
from
crazy
boots
the
major
too
presently
when
he
grew
a
trifle
maudlin
over
his
own
sorrows
began
to
call
him
frankie
and
my
boy
and
somehow
it
mattered
from
a
man
with
the
major
obvious
record
frank
pulled
himself
up
only
just
in
time
to
prevent
a
retort
when
it
first
happened
but
it
was
not
the
slightest
use
to
be
resentful
the
thing
had
to
be
borne
and
it
became
easier
when
it
occurred
to
him
to
regard
the
major
as
a
study
it
was
even
interesting
to
hear
him
give
himself
away
yet
all
with
a
pompous
appearance
of
and
to
recount
his
first
meeting
with
gertie
now
asleep
upstairs
the
man
was
in
fact
exactly
what
frank
in
his
prosperous
days
would
have
labeled
bounder
he
had
a
number
of
meaningless
little
mannerisms
a
way
of
passing
his
hand
over
his
mustache
a
trick
of
bringing
a
look
of
veiled
insolence
into
his
eyes
there
were
subjects
he
could
not
keep
away
from
among
them
harrow
school
the
universities
which
he
called
the
regiment
he
had
belonged
to
and
a
certain
type
of
adventure
connected
with
women
and
champagne
and
underneath
the
whole
crust
of
what
the
major
took
to
be
breeding
there
was
a
piteous
revelation
of
a
feeble
vindictive
and
rather
nasty
character
it
became
more
and
more
evident
that
the
cheating
incident
or
rather
the
accusation
as
he
persisted
in
calling
it
was
merely
the
last
straw
in
his
fall
and
that
the
whole
thing
had
been
the
result
of
a
crumbly
unprincipled
kind
of
will
underneath
rather
than
of
any
particular
strain
of
vice
he
appeared
even
now
to
think
that
his
traveling
about
with
a
woman
who
was
not
his
wife
was
a
sort
of
remnant
of
fallen
splendor
as
a
man
might
keep
a
couple
of
silver
spoons
out
of
the
ruin
of
his
house
i
recommend
you
to
pick
up
with
one
remarked
the
major
there
are
plenty
to
be
had
if
you
go
about
it
the
right
way
thanks
said
frank
but
it
not
my
line
iv
the
morning
too
was
a
little
trying
frank
had
passed
a
tolerable
night
the
major
had
retired
upstairs
about
ten
taking
his
socks
with
him
presumably
to
sleep
in
them
and
frank
had
heard
him
creaking
about
upstairs
for
a
minute
or
two
there
had
followed
two
clumps
as
the
boots
were
thrown
off
a
board
suddenly
spoke
loudly
there
was
a
little
talking
obviously
the
major
had
awakened
gertie
in
order
to
make
a
remark
or
two
and
then
silence
frank
had
not
slept
for
half
an
hour
he
was
thinking
with
some
depression
of
the
dreary
affair
into
which
he
had
been
initiated
of
the
major
and
of
gertie
for
whom
he
was
beginning
to
be
sorry
he
did
not
suppose
that
the
man
actually
bullied
her
probably
he
had
done
this
sufficiently
for
the
present
she
was
certainly
very
quiet
and
subdued
or
perhaps
she
really
admired
him
and
thought
it
rather
magnificent
to
travel
about
with
an
anyhow
it
was
rather
deplorable
when
he
awoke
next
morning
the
depression
was
on
him
still
and
it
was
not
lifted
by
the
apparition
of
gertie
on
which
he
opened
his
eyes
from
his
corner
in
an
amazingly
dirty
petticoat
with
her
hair
in
a
thick
untidy
trying
to
blow
the
fire
into
warmth
again
frank
jumped
up
he
was
in
his
trousers
and
shirt
let
me
do
that
he
said
i
do
it
said
gertie
passionlessly
the
major
came
down
ten
minutes
later
considerably
the
worse
for
his
night
rest
yesterday
he
had
had
a
day
beard
on
him
he
had
two
and
there
was
a
silvery
sort
of
growth
in
the
stubble
that
made
it
look
wet
his
eyes
too
were
red
and
sunken
and
he
began
almost
instantly
to
talk
about
a
drink
frank
stood
it
for
a
few
minutes
then
he
understood
and
capitulated
i
stand
you
one
he
said
if
you
get
me
two
packets
of
cinderellas
what
the
good
of
that
said
the
major
pubs
are
open
yet
only
just
gone
five
you
have
to
wait
then
said
frank
shortly
presently
the
major
did
begin
to
bully
gertie
he
asked
her
what
the
devil
was
the
good
of
her
if
she
could
make
a
fire
burn
better
than
that
he
elbowed
her
out
of
the
way
and
set
to
work
at
it
himself
she
said
nothing
at
all
yet
there
was
not
the
faintest
use
in
interfering
and
indeed
there
was
nothing
to
interfere
in
food
too
this
morning
seemed
disgusting
and
again
frank
learned
the
difference
between
a
kind
of
game
played
by
oneself
and
a
reality
in
which
two
others
joined
there
had
been
something
almost
pleasing
about
unrolling
the
food
wrapped
up
at
supper
on
the
previous
night
and
eating
it
with
or
without
cooking
all
alone
but
there
was
something
astonishingly
unpleasant
in
observing
sardines
that
were
now
common
property
lying
in
greasy
newspaper
a
lump
of
bread
from
which
their
hands
tore
pieces
and
a
tin
bowl
of
warmish
cocoa
from
which
all
must
drink
this
last
detail
was
a
contribution
on
the
part
of
major
and
trustcott
and
it
would
have
been
ungracious
to
refuse
the
major
too
was
sullen
and
resentful
this
morning
and
growled
at
gertie
more
than
once
even
the
weather
seemed
unpropitious
as
they
set
out
together
again
soon
after
six
rain
had
fallen
in
the
night
yet
not
all
the
rain
that
there
was
overhead
there
were
still
clouds
hanging
mixed
with
the
smoke
from
the
chimneys
the
hedges
seemed
dulled
and
black
in
spite
of
their
green
the
cinder
path
they
walked
on
was
depressing
the
road
even
more
so
they
passed
a
dozen
men
on
their
way
to
the
pits
who
made
remarks
on
the
three
and
retaliation
was
out
of
the
question
it
was
very
disconcerting
to
frank
to
find
the
difference
that
his
new
circumstances
made
and
yet
he
did
not
seriously
consider
changing
them
it
seemed
to
him
somehow
or
other
in
that
strange
fashion
in
which
such
feelings
come
that
the
whole
matter
was
and
that
the
company
in
which
he
found
himself
was
as
inevitably
his
at
least
for
the
present
as
the
family
to
a
child
born
into
it
and
there
was
of
course
too
a
certain
element
of
relief
in
feeling
himself
no
longer
completely
alone
and
there
was
also
as
frank
said
later
a
curious
sense
of
attraction
towards
and
pity
for
gertie
that
held
him
there
at
the
first
that
was
open
the
major
stopped
i
get
your
cinderellas
now
if
you
like
he
said
this
had
not
been
frank
idea
but
he
hardly
hesitated
all
right
he
said
here
fourpence
the
major
vanished
through
the
as
a
miner
came
out
and
a
gush
of
sweet
and
sickly
scent
beer
spirits
tobacco
poured
upon
the
fresh
air
and
there
was
a
vision
of
a
sawdusted
floor
and
spittoons
within
frank
looked
at
gertie
who
had
stopped
like
a
patient
donkey
and
like
a
prudent
one
had
let
her
bundle
instantly
down
beside
the
major
like
one
too
he
said
she
shook
her
head
not
for
me
and
no
more
in
a
couple
of
minutes
the
major
was
out
again
only
had
one
packet
left
he
said
and
with
an
air
of
extreme
punctiliousness
and
magnanimity
replaced
one
penny
in
frank
hand
he
had
the
air
of
one
who
is
insistent
on
the
little
honesties
of
life
there
was
also
a
faintly
spirituous
atmosphere
about
him
and
his
eyes
looked
a
little
less
sunken
then
he
handed
over
the
cigarettes
should
mind
one
myself
he
said
genially
frank
gave
him
one
before
lighting
his
own
you
a
good
sort
said
the
major
and
i
wish
i
could
give
you
one
of
my
old
cigars
i
used
to
give
my
friends
ah
well
when
your
ship
comes
home
observed
frank
throwing
away
his
match
the
major
nodded
his
head
as
with
an
air
of
fallen
grandeur
well
he
said
that
means
my
dear
he
explained
to
gertie
gertie
said
nothing
they
took
up
their
bundles
and
went
on
v
it
was
not
till
a
week
later
that
gertie
did
that
which
was
to
effect
so
much
in
frank
she
confided
in
him
the
week
had
consisted
of
the
kind
of
thing
that
might
be
expected
small
negligible
adventures
work
now
and
then
the
major
and
frank
working
side
by
side
a
digging
job
on
one
day
the
carrying
of
rather
dingy
hay
on
another
the
scraping
of
that
ran
round
the
small
pink
house
of
a
retired
tradesman
who
observed
them
magnificently
though
a
window
all
the
while
with
a
cigar
in
his
teeth
and
ultimately
gave
them
ninepence
between
them
they
slept
here
and
there
once
on
a
rainy
night
in
real
lodgings
once
below
a
haystack
frank
said
hardly
a
word
to
gertie
and
did
little
more
than
listen
to
the
major
who
was
already
beginning
to
repeat
himself
but
he
was
aware
that
the
girl
was
watching
him
the
crisis
came
about
under
circumstances
that
might
be
expected
on
a
rather
sentimental
kind
of
sunday
evening
in
a
village
whose
name
i
forget
perhaps
it
was
escrick
between
selby
and
york
frank
had
made
a
small
excursion
by
himself
in
the
morning
and
had
managed
to
hear
mass
they
had
dined
well
off
cold
bacon
and
beans
and
had
walked
on
in
the
afternoon
some
miles
further
and
they
came
to
the
village
a
little
after
six
the
major
had
a
blister
which
he
had
exhibited
at
least
four
times
to
the
company
and
had
refused
to
go
further
and
as
they
came
to
the
outskirts
of
the
village
volunteered
to
go
and
look
for
shelter
if
the
two
would
wait
for
him
at
a
stile
that
led
across
fields
to
the
old
church
the
scene
was
rather
like
the
setting
of
the
last
act
in
a
melodrama
of
a
theater
on
the
surrey
side
of
the
thames
the
act
in
which
the
injured
heroine
with
her
child
sinks
down
fainting
as
the
folk
are
going
to
church
in
the
old
village
on
a
june
evening
among
the
trees
leading
up
to
moonlight
effects
and
reunion
there
was
no
organ
to
play
off
but
the
bells
were
an
excellent
substitute
and
it
was
these
that
presently
melted
the
heart
of
gertie
when
the
major
had
disappeared
limping
the
two
climbed
over
the
stile
and
sat
down
with
their
bundles
under
the
hedge
but
they
presently
found
that
they
had
chosen
something
of
a
thoroughfare
voices
came
along
presently
grew
louder
and
stopped
as
the
speakers
climbed
the
stile
the
first
pair
was
of
a
boy
and
girl
who
instantly
clasped
again
mutual
waists
and
went
off
up
the
path
across
the
field
to
the
churchyard
without
noticing
the
two
tramps
their
heads
were
very
near
together
then
other
couples
came
along
old
and
young
and
twice
a
trio
one
two
young
men
in
black
who
skirmished
on
either
side
of
a
very
sedate
girl
in
white
one
two
girls
who
shoved
one
another
and
giggled
walking
in
step
three
yards
behind
another
young
man
with
his
hat
on
one
side
who
gloried
in
being
talked
at
and
pretended
to
be
rapt
in
abstraction
then
some
children
came
then
a
family
papa
walking
severely
apart
in
a
silk
hat
and
mamma
stout
and
in
the
midst
of
the
throng
finally
there
came
along
a
very
old
darby
and
joan
who
with
many
yorkshire
ejaculations
helped
one
another
over
the
stile
and
moved
on
with
bent
heads
scolding
one
another
affectionately
it
was
as
this
last
couple
reached
the
spot
where
the
path
ran
into
the
corn
that
the
peal
of
four
bells
broke
out
and
gertie
broke
down
frank
had
not
been
noticing
her
particularly
he
was
gloomy
himself
the
novelty
of
the
whole
affair
had
gone
the
major
was
becoming
intolerable
and
frank
religion
was
beginning
to
ebb
from
his
emotions
mass
this
morning
had
not
been
a
success
from
an
emotional
point
of
view
he
had
had
an
uncomfortable
seat
on
a
bench
in
a
tin
church
with
an
american
organ
the
very
young
priest
had
been
tiresome
and
antipathetic
frank
had
done
his
best
but
he
was
tired
and
bored
the
little
church
had
been
very
hot
and
it
was
no
longer
any
fun
to
be
stared
at
superciliously
by
a
stout
tradesman
as
he
came
out
into
the
hot
sunshine
afterwards
just
now
he
had
been
watching
the
figures
make
their
appearance
from
the
stile
groups
and
dwindle
slowly
down
to
the
corn
and
their
heads
and
shoulders
bob
along
above
it
all
with
a
kind
of
resentment
these
people
had
found
their
life
he
was
still
looking
for
his
he
was
watching
too
the
strangely
unreal
appearance
of
the
sunlit
fields
the
long
shadows
the
golden
smoky
light
and
the
church
tower
set
among
cypresses
half
a
mile
away
yet
without
any
conscious
sentiment
he
had
not
said
a
word
to
gertie
nor
she
to
him
and
he
was
totally
taken
by
surprise
when
after
the
first
soft
crash
of
bells
for
evening
service
she
had
suddenly
thrown
herself
round
face
forward
among
the
grasses
and
burst
out
sobbing
my
dear
girl
said
frank
whatever
the
matter
then
he
stopped
fortunately
the
procession
of
worshipers
had
run
dry
and
the
two
were
quite
alone
he
sat
upright
utterly
ignorant
of
what
to
say
he
thought
perhaps
she
was
in
pain
should
he
run
for
the
major
or
a
doctor
then
as
after
a
minute
or
two
of
violent
sobbing
she
began
a
few
incoherent
words
he
understood
oh
i
a
wicked
girl
a
wicked
girl
it
all
so
beautiful
the
church
bells
my
mother
he
understood
then
what
had
precipitated
this
crisis
and
broken
down
the
girl
reserve
it
was
in
fact
exactly
that
same
appeal
which
holds
a
gallery
breathless
and
tearful
in
the
last
act
of
a
melodrama
the
combination
of
sunday
quiet
a
sunset
church
bells
associations
and
human
relationships
and
gertie
little
suburban
soul
responded
to
it
as
a
bell
to
a
it
was
this
kind
of
thing
that
stood
to
her
for
holiness
and
peace
and
purity
and
it
had
gone
clean
through
her
heart
and
he
understood
too
that
it
was
his
presence
that
had
allowed
her
to
break
down
the
major
atmosphere
had
held
her
taut
so
far
frank
was
conscious
of
a
lump
in
his
own
throat
as
he
stared
out
helpless
first
at
the
peaceful
sunday
fields
and
then
down
at
the
shaking
shoulders
and
the
slender
writhed
form
of
gertie
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
he
hoped
the
major
would
not
be
back
just
yet
then
he
understood
he
must
say
something
do
cry
he
said
the
major
she
sat
up
on
the
instant
in
sudden
consternation
her
pretty
weak
sunburned
face
disfigured
with
tears
but
braced
for
the
moment
by
fear
no
no
said
frank
he
is
coming
yet
but
then
she
was
down
again
moaning
and
talking
oh
oh
i
a
wicked
girl
my
mother
and
i
never
thought
i
should
come
to
this
well
why
do
you
chuck
it
said
frank
practically
i
ca
i
ca
i
i
love
him
that
had
not
occurred
to
this
young
man
as
a
conceivable
possibility
and
he
sat
silenced
the
pealed
on
the
sun
sank
a
little
lower
gertie
sobbed
more
and
more
gently
and
frank
mind
worked
like
a
mill
revolving
developments
finally
she
grew
quiet
lay
still
and
as
the
bells
gave
place
to
one
of
their
number
sat
up
she
dabbed
at
her
eyes
with
a
handful
of
wet
grass
passed
her
sleeve
across
them
once
or
twice
and
began
to
talk
i
i
very
silly
frankie
she
said
but
i
ca
help
it
better
now
do
tell
george
of
course
i
sha
said
frank
indignantly
you
a
gentleman
too
said
gertie
frank
winced
a
little
interiorly
at
the
too
i
can
see
that
you
polite
to
a
lady
and
i
do
know
however
i
came
to
tell
you
but
there
it
is
and
no
done
why
do
you
leave
him
said
frank
courageously
a
little
wave
of
feeling
went
over
her
face
he
a
gentleman
she
said
no
i
ca
leave
him
but
it
does
come
over
you
sometimes
does
it
her
face
wavered
again
it
was
them
bells
and
the
people
and
all
where
your
home
she
jerked
her
head
in
a
vague
direction
down
londonwards
she
said
but
that
all
done
with
i
made
my
bed
and
tell
me
plainly
does
he
bully
you
not
to
say
bully
she
said
he
struck
me
once
but
never
again
tell
me
if
he
does
it
again
a
small
sly
admirative
look
came
into
her
eyes
we
see
she
said
frank
was
conscious
of
a
considerable
sense
of
disappointment
the
thing
had
been
almost
touching
just
now
as
the
reserve
first
broke
up
but
it
was
a
very
poor
little
soul
it
seemed
to
him
that
had
at
last
made
its
appearance
he
did
not
yet
see
that
that
made
it
all
the
more
touching
he
did
not
quite
see
what
to
do
next
he
was
christian
enough
to
resent
the
whole
affair
but
he
was
aristocratic
enough
in
his
fastidiousness
to
think
at
this
moment
that
perhaps
it
did
not
matter
much
for
people
of
this
sort
perhaps
it
was
the
highest
ideal
that
persons
resembling
the
major
and
gertie
could
conceive
but
her
next
remark
helped
to
break
up
his
complacency
you
a
catholic
she
said
people
say
that
you
catholics
do
mind
this
kind
of
thing
me
and
the
major
i
mean
there
was
a
dreadful
sort
of
sly
suggestiveness
about
this
remark
that
stung
him
he
exploded
and
his
wounded
pride
gave
him
bitterness
my
good
girl
he
said
catholics
simply
loathe
it
and
even
personally
i
think
it
beastly
well
i
i
think
it
beastly
said
frank
didactically
a
good
girl
like
you
good
parents
nice
home
religious
instead
of
which
he
ended
in
a
burst
of
ironical
reminiscence
you
go
traveling
about
with
a
he
checked
himself
a
man
who
is
your
husband
why
you
marry
him
i
ca
wailed
gertie
suddenly
stricken
again
with
remorse
his
wife
alive
frank
jumped
somehow
that
had
never
occurred
to
him
and
yet
how
amazingly
characteristic
of
the
major
well
leave
him
then
i
ca
cried
poor
gertie
i
ca
i
ca
chapter
iv
i
frank
awoke
with
a
start
and
opened
his
eyes
but
it
was
still
dark
and
he
could
see
nothing
so
he
turned
over
on
the
other
side
and
tried
to
go
to
sleep
the
three
of
them
had
come
to
this
little
town
last
night
after
two
or
three
days
regular
employment
they
had
sufficient
money
between
them
they
had
found
a
quite
tolerable
lodging
they
had
their
programme
such
as
it
was
for
the
next
day
or
so
and
by
the
standard
to
which
he
had
learned
to
adjust
himself
there
was
no
sort
of
palpable
cause
for
the
horror
that
presently
fell
on
him
i
can
only
conjecture
that
the
origin
lay
within
not
without
his
personality
the
trouble
began
with
the
consciousness
that
on
the
one
side
he
was
really
tired
and
on
the
other
that
he
could
not
sleep
and
to
clinch
it
the
knowledge
that
a
walk
lay
before
him
he
began
to
tell
himself
that
sleep
was
merely
a
question
of
will
of
will
deliberately
relaxing
attention
he
rearranged
his
position
a
little
shifted
his
feet
fitted
himself
a
little
more
closely
into
the
outlines
of
the
bed
thrust
one
hand
under
the
pillow
and
bade
himself
let
go
then
the
procession
of
thoughts
began
as
orderly
as
if
by
signal
he
found
himself
presently
after
enumerating
all
the
minor
physical
points
of
discomfort
the
soreness
of
his
feet
the
knobbiness
of
the
bed
the
stuffiness
of
the
room
in
which
the
three
were
sleeping
the
sound
of
the
major
slow
snoring
beginning
to
consider
the
wisdom
of
the
whole
affair
this
was
a
point
that
he
had
not
consciously
yet
considered
from
the
day
on
which
he
had
left
cambridge
the
impetus
of
his
first
impulse
and
the
extreme
strength
of
his
purpose
had
up
to
the
present
helped
along
by
novelty
kept
him
going
of
course
the
moment
had
to
come
sooner
or
later
but
it
seems
a
little
hard
that
he
was
obliged
to
face
it
in
that
peculiarly
dreary
clarity
of
mind
that
falls
upon
the
sleepless
an
hour
or
two
before
the
dawn
for
as
he
looked
at
it
all
now
he
saw
it
as
an
outsider
would
see
it
no
longer
from
the
point
of
view
of
his
own
personality
he
perceived
a
young
man
of
excellent
abilities
and
prospects
sacrificing
these
things
for
an
idea
that
fell
to
pieces
the
instant
it
was
touched
he
touched
it
now
with
a
critical
finger
and
it
did
so
fall
to
pieces
there
was
obviously
nothing
in
it
at
all
it
was
an
impulse
of
silly
pride
of
obstinacy
of
the
sort
of
romance
that
effects
nothing
there
was
merefield
waiting
for
him
for
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
terms
could
be
arranged
there
was
all
that
leisureliness
and
comfort
and
distinction
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
and
which
he
knew
well
how
to
use
there
was
jenny
there
was
his
dog
his
horse
there
was
in
fact
everything
for
which
merefield
stood
he
saw
it
all
now
visualized
and
clear
in
the
dark
and
he
had
exchanged
all
this
well
for
this
room
and
the
major
company
and
toil
and
for
no
reason
so
he
regarded
all
this
for
a
good
long
while
with
his
eyes
closed
with
the
darkness
round
him
with
every
detail
visible
and
insistent
seen
as
in
the
cold
light
of
morning
before
colors
reassert
themselves
and
reconcile
all
into
a
reasonable
whole
i
must
really
go
to
sleep
said
frank
to
himself
and
screwed
up
his
eyes
tight
there
came
of
course
a
reaction
presently
and
he
turned
to
his
religion
he
groped
for
his
rosary
under
his
pillow
placed
before
him
according
to
the
instructions
given
in
the
little
books
the
mystery
of
the
annunciation
to
mary
and
began
the
our
father
through
it
he
began
all
over
again
to
think
about
cambridge
and
merefield
and
jack
kirkby
and
the
auction
in
his
own
rooms
and
his
last
and
the
design
on
the
and
what
a
fool
he
was
and
when
he
became
conscious
of
the
rosary
again
he
found
that
he
held
in
his
fingers
the
last
bead
but
three
in
the
fifth
decade
he
had
repeated
four
and
a
half
decades
without
even
the
faintest
semblance
of
attention
he
finished
them
hopelessly
and
then
savagely
thrust
the
string
of
beads
under
his
pillow
again
turned
over
once
more
rearranged
his
feet
wished
the
major
would
learn
how
to
sleep
like
a
gentleman
and
began
to
think
about
his
religion
in
itself
after
all
he
began
to
say
to
himself
what
proof
was
there
real
scientific
proof
that
the
thing
was
true
at
all
certainly
there
was
a
great
deal
of
it
that
was
very
convincing
there
was
the
curious
ring
of
assertion
and
confidence
in
it
there
was
its
whole
character
composed
like
personality
of
countless
touches
too
small
to
be
definable
there
was
the
definite
evidence
adduced
from
history
and
philosophy
and
all
the
rest
but
underneath
all
that
was
there
after
all
any
human
evidence
in
the
world
sufficient
to
establish
the
astounding
dogmas
that
lay
at
the
root
was
it
conceivable
that
any
such
evidence
could
be
forthcoming
he
proceeded
to
consider
the
series
of
ancient
dilemmas
which
i
suppose
have
presented
themselves
at
some
time
or
another
to
every
reasonable
being
and
predestination
love
and
pain
foreknowledge
and
sin
and
their
companions
and
it
appeared
to
him
in
this
cold
emotionless
mood
when
the
personality
shivers
naked
in
the
presence
of
monstrous
and
unsympathetic
forces
that
his
own
religion
as
much
as
every
other
was
entirely
powerless
before
them
he
advanced
yet
further
he
began
to
reflect
upon
the
innumerable
little
concrete
devotions
that
he
had
recently
learned
the
repetition
of
certain
words
the
performance
of
certain
actions
the
rosary
for
instance
and
he
began
to
ask
himself
how
it
was
credible
that
they
could
possibly
make
any
difference
to
eternal
issues
these
things
had
not
yet
surrounded
themselves
with
the
atmosphere
of
experience
and
association
and
they
had
lost
the
romance
of
novelty
they
lay
before
him
detached
so
to
say
and
unconvincing
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
during
this
hour
he
consciously
disbelieved
he
honestly
attempted
to
answer
these
questions
he
threw
himself
back
upon
authority
and
attempted
to
reassure
himself
by
reflecting
that
human
brains
a
great
deal
more
acute
than
his
own
found
in
the
dilemmas
no
final
obstacles
to
faith
he
placed
himself
under
the
shelter
of
the
church
and
tried
to
say
blindly
that
he
believed
what
she
believed
but
in
a
sense
he
was
powerless
the
blade
of
his
adversary
was
quicker
than
his
own
his
will
was
very
nearly
dormant
his
heart
was
entirely
lethargic
and
his
intellect
was
clear
up
to
a
certain
point
and
extraordinarily
swift
half
an
hour
later
he
was
in
a
pitiable
state
and
had
begun
even
to
question
jenny
loyalty
he
had
turned
to
the
thought
of
her
as
a
last
resort
for
soothing
and
reassurance
and
now
in
the
chilly
dawn
even
she
seemed
unsubstantial
he
began
by
remembering
that
jenny
would
not
live
for
ever
in
fact
she
might
die
at
any
moment
or
he
might
and
he
ended
by
wondering
firstly
whether
human
love
was
worth
anything
at
all
and
secondly
whether
he
possessed
jenny
he
understood
now
with
absolute
certitude
that
there
was
nothing
in
him
whatever
which
could
possibly
be
loved
by
anyone
the
whole
thing
had
been
a
mistake
not
so
much
on
his
part
as
on
jenny
she
had
thought
him
to
be
something
he
was
not
she
was
probably
regretting
already
the
engagement
she
would
certainly
not
fulfill
it
and
could
she
possibly
care
for
anyone
who
had
been
such
an
indescribable
fool
as
to
give
up
merefield
and
his
prospects
and
his
past
and
his
abilities
and
set
out
on
this
absurd
and
childish
adventure
so
once
more
he
came
round
in
a
circle
and
his
misery
was
complete
he
sat
up
in
bed
with
a
sudden
movement
as
the
train
of
thought
clicked
back
into
its
own
beginning
clasped
his
hands
round
his
knees
and
stared
round
the
room
the
window
showed
a
faint
oblong
of
gray
now
beyond
where
the
major
breathed
and
certain
objects
were
dingily
and
coldly
visible
he
perceived
the
chair
on
which
his
clothes
were
heaped
with
the
exception
of
his
flannel
shirt
which
he
still
wore
he
caught
a
glimmer
of
white
where
gertie
blouse
hung
up
for
an
airing
he
half
expected
that
things
would
appear
more
hopeful
if
he
sat
up
in
bed
yet
they
did
not
the
sight
of
the
room
such
as
it
was
brought
the
concrete
and
material
even
more
forcibly
upon
him
the
gross
things
that
are
called
facts
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
were
no
facts
beyond
them
these
were
the
bones
of
the
universe
a
stuffy
bedroom
a
rasping
flannel
suit
a
cold
dawn
a
snoring
in
the
gloom
and
three
bodies
heavy
with
weariness
there
once
had
been
other
facts
merefield
and
cambridge
and
eton
had
once
existed
jenny
had
once
been
a
living
person
who
loved
him
once
there
had
been
a
thing
called
religion
but
they
existed
no
longer
he
had
touched
reality
at
last
frank
drew
a
long
dismal
sigh
he
lay
down
he
knew
the
worst
now
and
in
five
minutes
he
was
asleep
ii
of
course
the
thing
wore
away
by
midday
and
matters
had
readjusted
themselves
but
the
effect
remained
as
a
kind
of
bruise
below
the
surface
he
was
conscious
that
it
had
once
been
possible
for
him
to
doubt
the
value
of
everything
he
was
aware
that
there
was
a
certain
mood
in
which
nothing
seemed
worth
while
it
was
practically
his
first
experience
of
the
kind
and
he
did
not
understand
it
but
it
did
its
work
and
i
date
from
that
day
a
certain
increased
sort
of
obstinacy
that
showed
itself
even
more
plainly
in
his
character
one
thing
or
the
other
must
be
the
effect
of
such
a
mood
in
which
even
though
only
for
an
hour
or
two
all
things
other
than
physical
take
on
themselves
an
appearance
of
illusiveness
either
the
standard
is
lowered
and
these
things
are
treated
as
slightly
doubtful
or
the
will
sets
its
teeth
and
determines
to
live
by
them
whether
they
are
doubtful
or
not
and
the
latter
i
take
to
be
the
most
utter
form
of
faith
about
midday
the
twine
round
frank
bundle
broke
abruptly
and
every
several
article
fell
on
to
the
road
he
repressed
a
violent
feeling
of
irritation
and
turned
round
to
pick
them
up
the
major
and
gertie
instinctively
made
for
a
gate
in
the
hedge
rested
down
their
bundles
and
leaned
against
it
frank
gathered
the
articles
a
shirt
a
pair
of
softer
shoes
a
razor
and
brush
a
tin
of
potted
meat
a
rosary
a
small
round
cracked
and
a
piece
of
lead
piping
and
packed
them
once
more
carefully
together
on
the
bank
he
tested
his
string
knotted
it
drew
it
tight
and
it
broke
again
the
tin
of
potted
meat
like
some
small
intelligent
animal
ran
hastily
off
the
path
and
dived
into
a
small
drain
a
short
cry
of
mirth
broke
from
the
major
and
gertie
smiled
frank
said
nothing
at
all
he
lay
down
on
the
road
plunged
his
arm
into
the
drain
and
drew
up
the
potted
meat
it
had
some
moist
substance
adhering
to
it
which
he
wiped
off
on
to
his
sleeve
and
then
regretted
having
done
so
again
he
packed
his
things
again
he
drew
the
string
tight
and
again
it
snapped
lord
man
do
be
so
hard
on
it
frank
looked
up
with
a
kind
of
patient
fury
his
instinct
was
to
kick
every
single
object
that
lay
before
him
on
the
path
as
hard
as
possible
in
every
direction
have
you
any
more
string
he
said
no
stick
the
things
in
your
pocket
and
come
on
frank
made
no
answer
he
went
to
the
hedge
and
drew
out
a
long
supple
twig
of
hazel
stripped
it
of
its
leaves
and
once
more
tried
with
it
to
tie
up
his
parcel
but
the
angle
was
too
acute
and
just
as
the
twig
tightened
satisfactorily
it
snapped
and
this
time
the
razor
slid
out
sideways
into
a
single
minute
puddle
that
lay
on
the
path
the
major
snorted
in
mirthful
impatience
but
kindly
let
me
alone
said
frank
icily
the
thing
got
to
go
like
this
or
not
at
all
he
drew
out
the
razor
from
the
puddle
opened
it
and
dried
the
blade
on
his
sleeve
during
the
process
gertie
moved
suddenly
and
he
looked
up
when
he
looked
down
again
be
perceived
that
he
had
slit
a
neat
slice
into
the
cloth
of
his
jacket
he
remained
quite
still
for
one
moment
then
he
sat
down
on
the
bank
and
examined
the
twine
once
more
the
major
began
to
make
slightly
offensive
comments
then
frank
looked
up
you
can
go
to
hell
he
said
quite
softly
or
anywhere
else
you
like
but
i
going
to
do
up
the
bundle
in
my
way
and
not
yours
now
that
is
a
sort
of
parable
it
really
happened
for
it
was
reported
to
a
witness
by
frank
himself
exactly
as
i
have
told
it
and
it
seems
to
me
a
very
good
little
symbol
of
his
state
of
mind
it
is
quite
indefensible
of
course
and
especially
his
regrettable
language
that
closed
the
interview
but
it
gives
a
pleasant
little
glimpse
i
think
of
frank
character
just
now
in
section
the
things
had
to
go
in
a
certain
way
he
saw
no
adequate
reason
to
change
that
way
and
ultimately
of
course
the
twine
held
it
must
have
been
a
great
satisfaction
to
him
iii
it
seems
that
frank
must
have
been
allowed
just
now
to
sample
several
different
kinds
of
moods
for
he
had
a
very
different
kind
of
awakening
a
day
or
two
later
they
had
come
to
some
piece
of
open
country
that
i
am
unable
to
identify
and
for
some
reason
or
other
determined
to
spend
the
night
out
of
doors
there
was
a
copse
a
hundred
yards
away
from
the
road
and
in
the
copse
a
couple
of
small
shelters
built
probably
for
shooting
the
major
and
gertie
took
possession
of
one
and
frank
of
the
other
after
they
had
supped
in
the
dark
under
the
beeches
frank
slept
deeply
and
well
half
waking
once
however
at
that
strange
moment
of
the
night
when
the
earth
turns
and
sighs
in
her
sleep
when
every
cow
gets
up
and
lies
down
again
he
was
conscious
of
a
shrill
crowing
thin
as
a
bugle
from
some
out
of
sight
then
he
turned
over
and
slept
again
when
he
awoke
it
was
daylight
he
lay
on
his
back
looking
at
the
network
of
twigs
overhead
the
beech
leaves
beyond
and
the
sky
visible
only
in
glimpses
feeling
extremely
awake
and
extremely
content
certainly
he
was
a
little
stiff
when
he
moved
but
there
was
a
kind
of
interior
contentment
that
caused
that
not
to
matter
after
a
minute
or
two
he
sat
up
felt
about
for
his
shoes
and
slipped
them
on
then
he
unwound
the
wrapping
about
his
neck
and
crept
out
of
the
shelter
it
was
that
strange
pause
before
the
dawn
when
the
light
has
broadened
so
far
as
to
extinguish
the
stars
and
to
bring
out
all
the
colors
of
earth
into
a
cold
deliberate
kind
of
tint
everything
was
absolutely
motionless
about
him
as
he
went
under
the
trees
and
came
out
above
the
wide
of
which
the
copse
was
a
sort
of
barrier
the
dew
lay
soaking
and
thick
on
the
grass
slopes
but
there
was
not
yet
such
light
as
to
bring
out
its
sparkle
and
everywhere
dotted
on
the
green
before
him
sat
hundreds
of
rabbits
the
nearest
not
twenty
yards
away
the
silence
and
the
solemnity
of
the
whole
seemed
to
him
extraordinary
there
was
not
a
leaf
that
stirred
each
hung
as
if
cut
of
steel
there
was
not
a
bird
which
chirped
nor
a
distant
cock
that
crew
the
rabbits
eyed
him
unafraid
in
this
hour
of
truce
it
seemed
to
him
like
some
vast
stage
on
to
which
he
had
wandered
unexpectedly
the
performance
of
the
day
before
had
been
played
to
an
end
the
night
was
finished
and
the
players
of
the
new
eternal
drama
were
not
yet
come
an
hour
hence
they
would
be
all
about
the
sounds
would
begin
again
men
would
cross
the
birds
would
be
busy
the
wind
would
awake
and
the
ceaseless
whisper
of
leaves
answer
its
talking
but
at
present
the
stage
was
washed
clean
and
silent
it
was
the
solemnity
then
that
impressed
him
most
solemnity
and
an
air
of
expectation
yet
it
was
not
mere
expectation
there
was
a
suggestion
of
the
fundamental
and
the
normal
as
if
perhaps
movement
and
sound
were
after
all
no
better
than
interruptions
as
if
this
fixed
poise
of
nature
were
something
complete
in
itself
as
if
these
trees
hung
out
their
leaves
to
listen
to
something
that
they
could
actually
hear
as
if
these
motionless
creatures
of
the
woodland
were
looking
upon
something
that
they
could
actually
see
as
if
there
were
some
great
secret
actually
present
and
displayed
in
dead
silence
and
invisibility
before
those
only
who
possessed
the
senses
necessary
to
perceive
it
it
was
odd
to
regard
life
from
this
standpoint
to
look
back
upon
the
days
and
their
incidents
that
were
past
forward
upon
the
days
and
incidents
to
come
again
it
was
possible
for
frank
to
look
upon
these
things
as
an
outsider
and
a
deliberate
critic
as
he
had
done
in
the
stuffy
room
of
the
in
the
town
yet
now
though
he
was
again
an
outsider
though
he
was
again
out
of
the
whirl
of
actual
living
he
seemed
to
be
looking
at
things
staring
out
as
he
was
almost
unseeingly
at
the
grass
slopes
before
him
from
exactly
the
opposite
side
then
they
had
seemed
to
him
the
only
realities
these
tangible
physical
things
and
all
else
illusion
now
it
was
the
physical
things
that
were
illusive
and
something
else
that
was
real
once
again
the
two
elements
of
life
lay
detached
matter
and
spirit
but
it
was
as
obviously
now
spirit
that
was
the
reality
as
it
had
been
matter
a
day
or
two
before
it
was
obviously
absurd
to
regard
these
outward
things
on
which
he
looked
as
anything
but
a
frame
of
something
completely
different
they
were
too
silent
too
still
too
little
to
be
complete
in
themselves
something
solid
lay
embraced
within
them
so
then
he
stared
and
ruminated
scarcely
perceiving
that
he
thought
so
intensely
conscious
was
he
of
that
of
which
he
thought
it
was
not
that
he
understood
anything
of
that
on
which
he
looked
he
was
but
aware
that
there
was
something
to
be
understood
and
the
trees
hung
rigid
above
him
and
the
clear
blue
sky
still
a
hard
stone
beyond
them
not
yet
flushed
with
dawn
and
the
grass
lay
before
him
contracted
it
seemed
with
cold
and
every
blade
soaked
in
wet
and
the
silence
was
profound
then
a
cock
crew
a
mile
away
a
thin
brazen
cry
a
rabbit
sat
up
then
crouched
and
bolted
and
the
spell
faded
like
a
mist
frank
turned
and
walked
back
under
the
trees
to
see
if
the
major
was
awake
chapter
v
i
we
are
arrived
now
at
one
of
those
few
deplorable
incidents
in
career
against
which
there
is
no
defense
and
the
painful
thing
about
it
is
that
frank
never
seemed
to
think
that
it
required
any
defense
he
shows
no
penitence
for
it
in
his
diary
and
yet
moralists
are
united
in
telling
us
that
we
must
never
do
evil
that
good
may
come
it
is
only
paralleled
by
his
rash
action
in
leaving
cambridge
in
defiance
of
all
advice
and
good
sense
so
far
that
is
to
say
as
a
legally
permissible
act
however
foolish
can
be
paralleled
by
one
of
actual
crime
moralists
probably
would
tell
us
in
fact
that
the
first
led
inevitably
to
the
second
it
fell
out
in
this
way
once
or
twice
in
his
travels
with
the
major
he
had
been
haunted
by
an
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
this
or
that
contribution
that
the
warrior
made
to
their
common
table
had
not
been
come
by
honestly
when
a
gentleman
known
to
possess
no
more
than
tenpence
and
with
a
predilection
to
drink
leaves
the
shelter
of
a
small
copse
let
us
say
at
seven
and
reappears
rather
breathless
forty
minutes
later
with
a
fowl
or
even
with
a
fowl
not
plucked
at
all
and
still
warm
or
with
half
a
dozen
eggs
and
in
addition
issues
out
again
later
in
the
evening
and
returns
with
a
strong
smell
of
spirits
and
a
watery
eye
it
seems
a
little
doubtful
as
to
whether
he
has
been
scrupulously
honest
in
cases
of
this
kind
frank
persevered
in
making
some
excuse
for
not
joining
in
the
festivity
he
put
it
to
himself
as
being
a
matter
of
pride
but
it
is
hard
to
understand
that
it
was
simply
that
in
a
young
man
who
made
no
scruple
of
begging
in
cases
of
necessity
however
there
it
was
and
even
the
major
who
began
by
protesting
ended
by
acquiescing
they
were
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
market
weighton
when
the
thing
happened
i
can
not
identify
the
exact
spot
the
situation
was
as
follows
they
had
secured
an
excellent
barn
for
their
night
lodging
facing
on
the
road
on
the
outskirts
of
a
village
behind
them
were
the
farm
buildings
and
the
farmer
household
gone
to
bed
the
sun
had
set
and
it
was
dark
they
had
supped
sparingly
of
necessity
and
had
finished
every
morsel
of
food
frank
had
even
found
himself
mechanically
gathering
up
crumbs
on
a
wet
finger
they
had
had
a
bad
week
of
it
the
corn
was
not
yet
ready
for
cutting
and
there
seemed
no
work
anywhere
for
honest
men
the
major
gloom
had
become
terrible
he
had
even
made
remarks
upon
a
choice
between
a
workhouse
and
a
razor
he
had
got
up
after
supper
and
turned
his
waistcoat
pockets
inside
out
to
secure
the
last
possible
grains
of
tobacco
and
had
smoked
about
a
quarter
of
a
pipeful
gathered
in
this
way
without
uttering
one
word
he
had
then
uttered
a
short
string
of
them
had
seized
his
cap
and
disappeared
frank
too
was
even
more
heavy
and
depressed
than
usual
the
last
shreds
of
romance
were
gone
from
his
adventure
long
ago
and
yet
his
obstinacy
held
firm
but
he
found
he
could
not
talk
much
he
watched
gertie
listlessly
as
she
listless
too
began
to
spread
out
nondescript
garments
to
make
a
bed
in
the
corner
he
hardly
spoke
to
her
nor
she
to
him
he
was
beginning
to
feel
sleepy
when
he
heard
rather
hurried
steps
as
of
one
trying
to
run
on
tiptoe
coming
up
the
lane
and
an
instant
later
in
popped
the
major
put
out
that
damned
light
he
whispered
sharply
the
candle
end
went
out
with
the
swiftness
of
thought
what
up
frank
roused
himself
to
ask
there
had
been
a
strenuous
look
about
the
face
seen
an
instant
before
that
interested
him
there
was
dead
silence
gertie
seemed
frozen
into
motionlessness
in
her
corner
almost
as
if
she
had
had
experience
of
this
kind
of
thing
before
frank
listened
with
all
his
ears
it
was
useless
to
stare
into
the
dark
here
in
this
barn
the
blackness
was
complete
at
first
there
was
no
sound
at
all
except
a
very
soft
occasional
scrape
of
a
that
betokened
that
the
major
was
seeking
cover
somewhere
then
so
suddenly
that
he
started
all
over
frank
felt
a
hand
on
his
arm
and
smelt
a
breath
alas
there
had
been
no
drink
see
here
frankie
my
boy
i
i
got
the
thing
on
me
what
shall
i
do
with
it
it
no
good
chucking
it
away
they
find
it
got
what
whispered
frank
there
was
a
kid
coming
along
she
had
a
tin
of
something
i
even
know
what
it
is
and
and
she
screamed
out
and
someone
ran
out
but
they
could
spot
me
it
was
too
dark
hush
whispered
frank
sharply
and
the
hand
tightened
on
his
arm
but
it
was
only
a
rat
somewhere
in
the
roof
well
he
said
frankie
i
suppose
you
would
take
it
from
me
and
and
be
off
somewhere
we
could
meet
again
later
i
i
afraid
someone
may
have
spotted
us
coming
through
the
village
earlier
they
they
search
i
expect
you
can
do
your
own
dirty
work
whispered
frank
earnestly
through
the
darkness
frankie
my
boy
do
be
hard
on
a
poor
devil
i
i
leave
gertie
well
hide
it
somewhere
no
good
they
good
god
the
voice
was
stricken
into
silence
once
more
as
a
light
hardly
seen
before
it
was
gone
again
shone
through
a
crack
in
the
side
of
the
barn
then
there
was
unmistakable
low
talking
somewhere
frank
felt
the
man
crouched
at
his
side
suddenly
stand
up
noiselessly
and
in
that
instant
his
own
mind
was
made
up
give
it
here
you
fool
he
said
here
he
felt
a
smooth
flat
and
circular
thing
thrust
suddenly
into
his
hands
with
a
whisper
that
he
could
not
catch
and
simultaneously
he
heard
a
rush
of
footsteps
outside
he
had
just
time
to
stuff
the
thing
inside
his
coat
and
roll
over
as
if
asleep
when
the
door
flew
open
and
three
or
four
men
with
a
policeman
at
their
head
burst
into
the
barn
ii
it
would
be
charitable
i
think
to
suppress
the
name
of
the
small
where
the
trial
was
held
the
excellent
magistrates
who
conducted
it
certainly
did
their
best
under
very
difficult
circumstances
for
what
are
you
to
do
if
a
man
accused
of
theft
cordially
pleads
guilty
and
yet
certainly
it
would
distress
them
to
hear
of
a
very
obvious
miscarriage
of
justice
executed
at
their
hands
on
friday
morning
at
ten
the
vehicles
began
to
arrive
the
motor
of
the
country
gentleman
the
of
the
neighboring
rector
and
the
brougham
of
the
retired
general
it
was
the
general
who
presided
the
was
not
more
dismal
than
usually
are
when
i
visited
it
on
my
little
pilgrimage
undertaken
a
few
months
ago
it
had
been
repainted
and
the
woodwork
grained
to
represent
oak
even
so
it
was
not
cheering
at
the
upper
end
under
one
of
the
windows
were
ranged
five
seats
on
a
da√Øs
with
a
long
table
before
them
then
on
a
lower
level
stood
the
clerk
and
solicitors
table
fenced
by
a
rail
from
the
vulgar
crowd
who
pressed
in
hot
and
excited
to
see
the
criminals
and
hear
justice
done
there
was
a
case
arising
from
an
ancient
family
feud
exploded
at
last
into
crime
one
lady
had
thrown
a
clog
at
another
as
the
last
repartee
in
a
little
dialogue
held
at
street
doors
the
clog
had
been
well
aimed
and
the
victim
appeared
now
with
a
very
large
white
bandage
under
her
bonnet
to
give
her
testimony
this
swelled
the
crowd
beyond
its
usual
proportions
as
both
ladies
were
well
known
in
society
the
general
was
a
old
man
frank
recognized
his
name
as
soon
as
he
heard
it
that
morning
though
he
had
never
met
him
before
and
conversed
cheerily
with
his
brother
magistrates
as
they
took
their
seats
the
rector
was
well
like
other
rectors
and
the
squire
like
other
squires
it
was
a
quarter
to
twelve
before
the
ladies
claims
were
adjusted
they
were
both
admonished
in
a
paternal
kind
of
way
and
sent
about
their
business
since
there
was
disputed
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
the
lady
with
the
bandage
had
provoked
the
attack
not
only
by
her
language
but
by
throwing
a
at
the
lady
without
the
bandage
they
were
well
talked
to
their
husbands
were
bidden
to
keep
them
in
order
and
they
departed
both
a
little
crestfallen
to
discuss
the
whole
matter
over
a
pint
of
beer
there
was
a
little
shifting
about
in
court
a
policeman
looking
curiously
human
without
his
helmet
pushed
forward
from
the
door
and
took
his
place
by
the
little
barrier
the
magistrates
and
the
clerk
and
the
inspector
all
conferred
a
little
together
and
after
an
order
or
two
the
door
near
the
back
of
the
court
leading
from
the
opened
and
frank
stepped
forward
into
the
dock
followed
by
another
policeman
who
clicked
the
barrier
behind
the
prisoner
and
stood
waiting
like
rhadamanthus
through
the
hedge
of
the
front
row
of
the
crowd
peered
the
faces
of
gertie
and
the
major
we
need
not
bother
with
the
preliminaries
in
fact
i
forget
how
they
ran
frank
gave
his
name
of
frank
gregory
his
age
as
years
his
occupation
as
casual
laborer
and
his
domicile
as
no
fixed
abode
the
charge
was
read
to
him
it
was
to
the
effect
that
he
on
the
night
of
tuesday
the
instant
had
in
the
village
whose
name
i
choose
to
forget
if
i
ever
knew
it
seized
from
maggie
cooper
aged
nine
years
a
tin
of
preserved
salmon
with
intent
to
steal
the
question
put
to
the
prisoner
was
did
he
or
did
he
not
plead
guilty
i
plead
guilty
sir
said
frank
without
a
tremor
he
had
been
two
full
days
in
the
cells
by
now
and
it
had
not
improved
his
appearance
he
was
still
deeply
sunburned
but
he
was
a
little
pale
under
the
eyes
and
he
was
unshaven
he
had
also
deliberately
rumpled
his
hair
and
pulled
his
clothes
to
make
them
look
as
untidy
as
possible
he
answered
in
a
low
voice
so
as
to
attract
as
little
attention
as
possible
he
had
given
one
quick
look
at
the
magistrates
as
he
came
in
to
make
sure
he
had
never
met
them
out
shooting
or
at
and
he
had
been
deeply
relieved
to
find
them
total
strangers
you
plead
guilty
eh
said
the
general
frank
nodded
well
well
let
hear
the
whole
story
where
is
the
complainant
a
rather
pale
and
child
appeared
somewhere
in
a
little
box
opposite
frank
with
a
virtuous
mother
in
black
silk
behind
her
it
appeared
that
this
child
was
on
her
way
to
her
aunt
her
father
was
a
grocer
with
a
tin
of
salmon
that
had
been
promised
and
forgotten
that
was
how
she
came
to
be
out
so
late
as
she
reached
the
corner
by
barker
lane
a
man
had
jumped
at
her
and
seized
the
tin
no
he
had
not
used
any
other
violence
she
had
screamed
at
the
top
of
her
voice
and
jennings
door
had
opened
then
the
man
had
run
away
had
she
seen
the
man
clearly
no
she
had
seen
him
at
all
she
had
just
seen
that
he
was
a
man
called
himself
one
put
in
a
voice
the
witness
here
cast
an
indignant
almost
vindictive
look
at
frank
then
a
few
corroborations
were
issued
jennings
a
widow
lady
keeping
house
for
her
brother
who
was
a
foreman
in
marks
yard
ratified
the
statement
about
the
door
being
opened
she
was
going
to
shut
up
for
the
night
when
she
heard
the
child
scream
her
brother
a
man
with
a
black
beard
finished
her
story
he
had
heard
his
sister
call
out
as
he
was
taking
off
his
boots
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
had
run
out
with
his
laces
dangling
in
time
to
see
the
man
run
past
the
fifty
yards
up
the
street
no
he
too
had
not
seen
the
man
clearly
but
he
had
seen
him
before
in
company
with
another
the
two
had
come
to
his
yard
that
afternoon
to
ask
for
work
and
been
refused
as
they
wanted
no
more
hands
well
what
had
happened
then
he
had
hammered
at
two
or
three
doors
as
he
ran
past
among
them
that
of
the
and
himself
had
run
on
in
time
to
hear
the
prisoner
footsteps
run
up
the
lane
leading
to
the
barn
he
had
stopped
then
as
he
was
out
of
breath
and
as
he
thought
they
would
have
the
man
now
since
there
was
no
exit
from
the
lane
except
through
and
if
he
gone
that
way
they
have
heard
the
dogs
finally
the
corroborated
the
entire
story
and
added
that
he
in
company
with
the
foreman
and
two
other
men
had
proceeded
to
the
barn
immediately
and
there
had
found
the
prisoner
who
was
pretending
to
be
asleep
with
the
tin
of
salmon
produced
and
laid
on
the
table
hidden
inside
his
jacket
he
had
then
taken
him
into
custody
was
there
any
one
else
in
the
barn
yes
two
persons
who
gave
the
names
of
george
and
gertie
trustcott
these
were
prepared
to
give
evidence
as
to
the
prisoner
identity
and
as
to
his
leaving
and
returning
to
the
barn
on
the
evening
in
question
if
the
magistrate
wished
yes
they
were
present
in
court
the
general
began
to
turn
a
little
testy
as
the
constable
finished
he
seemed
a
magistrate
who
liked
to
be
paternal
and
he
appeared
to
grow
impatient
under
the
extraordinarily
correct
language
of
the
policeman
he
turned
to
frank
seeming
to
forget
all
about
the
two
witnesses
not
yet
called
and
spoke
rather
sharply
you
do
deny
all
that
you
plead
guilty
eh
yes
sir
said
frank
gazing
at
the
very
pink
salmon
emblazoned
on
the
tin
why
did
you
do
it
i
was
hungry
sir
hungry
eh
an
lad
like
you
ca
you
work
then
when
i
can
get
it
sir
said
frank
eh
eh
well
that
true
enough
you
could
get
it
that
day
anyhow
told
us
that
yes
sir
then
the
rector
leaned
forward
swiftly
to
frank
horror
you
speak
like
an
educated
man
do
i
sir
i
very
pleased
to
hear
it
there
was
a
faint
snigger
in
court
where
were
you
educated
persisted
the
rector
am
i
bound
to
incriminate
myself
sir
incriminate
said
the
general
suddenly
interested
eh
you
mean
after
a
good
education
i
see
no
of
course
you
not
my
lad
thank
you
sir
and
you
plead
guilty
and
you
like
the
case
dealt
with
now
if
you
please
sir
the
clerk
rose
swiftly
in
his
place
and
began
to
whisper
to
the
magistrates
behind
his
hand
frank
understood
perfectly
what
was
happening
he
understood
that
it
was
doubtful
whether
or
no
his
case
could
be
dealt
with
in
this
court
he
exploded
within
himself
a
violent
adjuration
to
the
supreme
authorities
and
the
next
instant
the
general
sat
back
nonsense
nonsense
it
is
highway
robbery
at
all
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
we
deal
with
it
now
eh
gentlemen
there
was
a
little
more
whispering
and
finally
the
general
settled
himself
and
took
up
a
quill
pen
well
we
deal
with
it
now
my
lad
as
you
wish
i
sorry
to
see
a
fellow
like
you
in
this
position
particularly
if
you
had
a
good
education
as
you
seem
to
have
had
cowardly
thing
you
know
to
attack
a
child
like
that
is
it
even
if
you
were
hungry
you
ought
to
be
more
hardy
than
that
you
know
a
great
fellow
like
you
than
to
mind
a
bit
of
hunger
boys
like
you
ought
to
enlist
that
make
a
man
of
you
in
no
time
but
no
i
know
you
you
wo
you
sooner
loaf
about
and
pick
up
what
you
can
sooner
than
serve
his
majesty
well
well
there
no
compulsion
not
yet
but
you
should
think
over
it
come
and
see
me
if
you
like
when
you
done
your
time
and
we
see
what
can
be
done
that
be
better
than
loafing
about
and
picking
up
tins
of
salmon
eh
well
i
no
more
to
say
but
you
just
think
over
it
and
we
give
you
fourteen
days
then
as
frank
went
out
he
saw
the
three
magistrates
lean
back
in
conversation
iii
i
find
it
very
hard
to
explain
even
to
myself
the
extraordinary
depression
that
fell
upon
frank
during
his
fourteen
days
he
could
hardly
bear
even
to
speak
of
it
afterwards
and
i
find
in
his
diary
no
more
than
a
line
or
two
and
those
as
bald
as
possible
apparently
it
was
no
kind
of
satisfaction
to
him
to
know
that
the
whole
thing
was
entirely
his
own
doing
or
that
it
was
the
thought
of
gertie
that
had
made
him
in
the
first
instance
take
the
tin
from
the
major
yet
it
was
not
that
there
was
any
sense
of
guilt
or
even
of
mistake
one
would
have
thought
that
from
everybody
point
of
view
and
particularly
gertie
it
would
be
an
excellent
thing
for
the
major
to
go
to
prison
for
a
bit
it
would
certainly
do
him
no
harm
and
it
would
be
a
real
opportunity
to
separate
the
girl
from
his
company
as
for
any
wrong
in
his
pleading
guilty
he
defended
it
i
must
say
with
some
adroitness
by
saying
that
it
was
universally
acknowledged
that
the
plea
of
not
guilty
is
merely
formal
and
in
no
way
commits
one
to
its
intrinsic
truth
and
he
is
right
there
at
least
according
to
moral
theology
as
well
as
common
sense
and
therefore
that
the
alternative
plea
is
also
merely
formal
and
yet
he
was
depressed
by
his
fourteen
days
to
the
verge
of
melancholia
there
are
several
contributory
causes
that
may
be
alleged
first
there
is
the
extreme
ignominy
of
all
the
circumstances
beginning
with
the
paternal
scolding
in
court
in
the
presence
of
grocers
and
persons
who
threw
clogs
continuing
with
the
dreary
journey
by
rail
in
handcuffs
and
the
little
crowds
that
gathered
to
laugh
or
stare
and
culminating
with
the
details
of
the
prison
life
it
is
not
pleasant
for
a
cleanly
man
to
be
suspected
of
dirt
to
be
bathed
and
examined
all
over
by
a
man
suffering
himself
apparently
from
some
species
of
eczema
it
is
not
pleasant
to
be
ordered
about
peremptorily
by
uniformed
men
who
three
months
before
would
have
touched
their
hats
to
you
and
to
have
to
do
things
instantly
and
promptly
for
the
single
reason
that
one
is
told
to
do
them
secondly
there
was
the
abrupt
change
of
life
of
diet
air
and
exercise
thirdly
there
was
the
consideration
the
more
terrible
because
the
more
completely
unverifiable
as
to
what
difference
all
this
would
make
not
only
to
the
regard
of
his
friends
for
him
but
to
his
own
regard
for
himself
innocence
of
a
fault
does
not
entirely
do
away
with
the
distress
and
stigma
of
its
punishment
he
imagined
himself
telling
jenny
he
tried
to
see
her
laughing
and
somehow
he
could
not
it
was
wholly
uncharacteristic
of
all
that
he
knew
of
her
and
yet
somehow
night
after
night
as
the
hours
dragged
by
he
seemed
to
see
her
looking
at
him
a
little
contemptuously
at
any
rate
he
almost
heard
her
say
if
you
did
do
it
you
made
a
friend
of
a
man
who
did
and
you
were
in
prison
oh
there
are
countless
excellent
explanations
of
his
really
terrible
depression
and
yet
somehow
it
does
not
seem
to
me
at
all
in
line
with
what
i
know
of
frank
to
think
that
they
explain
it
in
the
least
i
prefer
to
believe
with
a
certain
priest
who
will
appear
by
and
by
that
the
thing
was
just
one
stage
of
a
process
that
had
to
be
accomplished
and
that
if
it
had
not
come
about
in
this
way
it
must
have
come
about
in
another
as
for
his
religion
all
emotional
grasp
of
that
fled
it
seemed
finally
at
the
touch
of
real
ignominy
he
retained
the
intellectual
reasons
for
which
he
had
become
a
catholic
but
the
thing
seemed
as
apart
from
him
as
his
knowledge
of
law
such
as
it
was
acquired
at
cambridge
or
his
proficiency
in
certainly
it
was
no
kind
of
consolation
to
him
to
reflect
on
the
sufferings
of
christian
martyrs
it
was
a
friday
evening
when
he
came
out
and
went
quickly
round
the
corner
of
the
jail
in
order
to
get
away
from
any
possibility
of
being
identified
with
it
he
had
had
a
short
interview
with
the
governor
a
very
conscientious
and
religious
man
who
made
a
point
of
delivering
what
he
called
a
few
earnest
words
to
every
prisoner
before
his
release
but
naturally
enough
they
were
extraordinarily
off
the
point
it
was
not
helpful
to
frank
to
have
it
urged
upon
him
to
set
about
an
honest
livelihood
it
was
what
he
had
tried
to
do
every
day
since
june
and
not
to
go
about
robbing
innocent
children
of
things
like
tins
of
salmon
it
was
the
very
last
thing
he
had
ever
dreamed
of
doing
he
had
also
had
more
than
one
interview
with
the
chaplain
of
the
established
church
in
consequence
of
his
resolute
refusal
to
acknowledge
any
religious
body
at
all
he
had
determined
to
scotch
this
possible
clue
to
his
identification
and
those
interviews
had
not
been
more
helpful
than
any
other
it
is
not
of
much
use
to
be
entreated
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
when
you
see
no
kind
of
reason
for
doing
so
and
little
books
left
tactfully
in
your
cell
directed
to
the
same
point
are
equally
useless
frank
read
them
drearily
through
he
did
not
actually
kick
them
from
side
to
side
of
his
cell
when
he
had
finished
that
would
have
been
offensive
to
the
excellent
intentions
of
the
reverend
gentleman
altogether
i
do
not
quite
like
to
picture
frank
as
he
was
when
he
came
out
of
jail
and
hurried
away
it
is
such
a
very
startling
contrast
with
the
gayety
with
which
he
had
begun
his
pilgrimage
he
had
had
plenty
of
time
to
think
over
his
plans
during
the
last
fortnight
and
he
went
first
straight
to
the
the
governor
had
given
him
to
start
life
with
and
he
proposed
to
squander
fourpence
of
it
at
once
in
two
stamps
two
sheets
of
paper
and
two
envelopes
his
first
letter
was
to
be
to
jack
the
second
to
major
trustcott
who
had
thoughtfully
given
him
the
address
where
he
might
be
found
about
that
date
but
there
were
to
be
one
or
two
additional
difficulties
first
he
arrived
at
the
went
up
the
steps
and
through
the
swing
doors
the
place
had
been
newly
decorated
with
a
mahogany
counter
and
light
brass
lattice
rails
behind
which
two
young
ladies
of
an
inexpressibly
aristocratic
demeanor
and
appearance
were
engaged
in
conversation
their
names
as
he
learned
from
a
few
sentences
he
listened
to
before
daring
to
interrupt
so
high
a
colloquy
were
miss
mills
and
miss
jamieson
after
a
decent
and
respectful
pause
frank
ventured
on
his
request
two
stamps
two
sheets
of
paper
and
two
envelopes
please
miss
he
did
manage
that
miss
mills
continued
her
conversation
so
i
said
to
her
that
that
would
never
do
that
harold
would
be
sure
to
get
hold
of
it
and
that
then
frank
shuffled
his
feet
a
little
miss
mills
cast
him
a
high
there
be
trouble
i
said
miss
jamieson
you
did
quite
right
dear
two
stamps
two
sheets
of
paper
and
two
envelopes
please
miss
he
clicked
four
pence
together
on
the
counter
miss
mills
rose
slowly
from
her
place
went
a
yard
or
two
and
took
down
a
large
book
frank
watched
her
gratefully
then
she
took
a
pen
and
began
to
make
entries
in
it
two
stamps
two
sheets
of
paper
and
two
envelopes
please
frank
voice
shook
a
little
with
anger
he
had
not
learned
his
lesson
yet
miss
mills
finished
her
entry
looked
at
frank
with
extreme
disdain
and
finally
drew
out
a
sheet
of
stamps
pennies
she
inquired
sharply
please
two
penny
stamps
were
pushed
across
and
two
pennies
taken
up
and
now
two
sheets
of
paper
and
two
envelopes
please
miss
went
on
frank
encouraged
he
thought
himself
foolish
to
be
angry
miss
jamieson
uttered
a
short
laugh
and
glanced
at
miss
mills
miss
mills
pursed
her
lips
together
and
took
up
her
pen
once
more
will
you
be
good
enough
to
give
me
what
i
ask
for
at
once
please
the
whole
of
frank
blazed
in
this
small
sentence
but
miss
mills
was
equal
to
it
you
ought
to
know
better
she
said
than
to
come
asking
for
such
things
here
taking
up
a
lot
of
time
like
that
you
do
keep
them
miss
mills
uttered
a
small
sound
miss
jamieson
tittered
shops
are
the
proper
places
for
this
is
a
words
can
not
picture
the
superb
high
breeding
shown
in
this
utterance
frank
should
have
understood
that
he
had
been
guilty
of
gross
impertinence
in
asking
such
things
of
miss
mills
it
was
treating
her
almost
as
a
but
he
was
extremely
angry
by
now
then
why
could
you
have
the
civility
to
tell
me
so
at
once
miss
jamieson
laid
aside
a
little
sewing
she
was
engaged
on
look
here
young
man
you
do
come
bullying
and
threatening
here
i
have
to
call
the
policeman
if
you
do
i
was
at
the
railway
station
last
friday
week
you
know
frank
stood
still
for
one
furious
instant
then
his
heart
sank
and
he
went
out
without
a
word
the
letters
got
written
at
last
late
that
evening
in
the
back
room
of
a
small
where
he
had
secured
a
bed
i
have
the
one
he
wrote
to
jack
before
me
as
i
write
and
i
copy
it
as
it
stands
it
was
without
address
or
date
dear
jack
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
i
want
you
to
go
to
merefield
and
see
first
jenny
and
then
my
father
and
tell
them
quite
plainly
and
simply
that
i
been
in
prison
for
a
fortnight
i
want
jenny
to
know
first
so
that
she
can
think
of
what
to
say
to
my
father
the
thing
i
was
sent
to
prison
for
was
that
i
pleaded
guilty
to
stealing
a
tin
of
salmon
from
a
child
called
mary
cooper
you
can
see
the
account
of
the
case
in
the
county
gazette
for
last
saturday
week
the
the
thing
i
really
did
was
to
take
the
tin
from
somebody
else
i
was
traveling
with
he
asked
me
to
next
i
want
you
to
send
on
any
letters
that
may
have
come
for
me
to
the
address
i
enclose
on
a
separate
piece
of
paper
please
destroy
the
address
at
once
but
you
can
show
this
letter
to
jenny
and
give
her
my
love
you
are
not
to
come
and
see
me
if
you
do
i
come
and
see
you
soon
things
are
pretty
bad
just
now
but
i
going
to
go
through
with
it
yours
f
by
the
way
please
address
me
as
gregory
when
you
write
he
was
perfectly
obstinate
you
understand
still
frank
troubles
as
regards
prison
were
by
no
means
exhausted
by
his
distressing
conversation
with
the
young
ladies
in
the
post
office
and
the
next
one
fell
on
him
as
he
was
leaving
the
little
town
early
on
the
saturday
morning
he
had
just
turned
out
of
the
main
street
and
was
going
up
a
quiet
side
lane
that
looked
as
if
it
would
lead
to
the
york
road
when
he
noticed
a
disagreeable
little
scene
proceeding
up
a
narrow
across
whose
mouth
he
was
passing
a
tall
young
man
in
his
obviously
slightly
excited
with
drink
had
hold
of
a
miserable
old
man
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
with
one
hand
and
was
cuffing
him
with
the
other
now
i
do
not
wish
to
represent
frank
as
a
sort
of
but
the
fact
is
that
if
anyone
with
respectable
and
humane
ideas
goes
on
the
tramp
i
have
this
from
the
mouth
of
experienced
persons
he
has
to
make
up
his
mind
fairly
soon
either
to
be
a
redresser
of
wrongs
or
to
be
conveniently
frank
was
not
yet
sufficiently
experienced
to
have
learned
the
wisdom
of
the
second
alternative
he
went
straight
up
the
and
without
any
words
at
all
hit
the
young
man
as
hard
as
possible
under
the
ear
nearest
to
him
there
seems
to
have
been
a
moment
of
amazed
silence
the
young
man
dropped
the
old
one
who
fled
out
into
the
lane
and
struck
back
at
frank
who
parried
simultaneously
a
woman
screamed
somewhere
and
faces
began
to
appear
at
windows
and
doors
it
is
curious
how
the
customs
of
the
middle
ages
as
well
as
some
of
their
oaths
seem
to
have
descended
to
the
ranks
of
the
british
in
the
old
days
as
also
in
it
was
quite
usual
to
assail
your
adversary
with
insults
as
well
as
with
blows
this
was
done
now
the
young
man
with
a
torrent
of
imprecations
demanded
who
frank
thought
he
was
asked
where
he
was
coming
to
required
of
society
in
general
an
explanation
of
a
interfering
between
a
son
and
a
qualified
father
there
was
a
murmur
of
applause
and
dissent
and
frank
answered
with
a
few
harmless
expletives
such
as
he
had
now
learned
to
employ
as
a
sort
of
verbal
disguise
that
he
did
not
care
how
many
sons
or
fathers
were
in
question
that
he
did
not
propose
to
see
a
certain
kind
of
bully
abuse
an
old
man
and
that
he
would
be
happy
to
take
the
old
man
place
then
the
battle
was
set
frank
had
learned
to
box
in
a
certain
small
saloon
in
market
street
cambridge
and
knew
perfectly
well
how
to
take
care
of
himself
he
received
about
half
the
force
of
one
extremely
hard
blow
just
on
his
left
before
he
got
warmed
to
his
work
but
after
that
he
did
the
giving
and
the
young
man
the
receiving
frank
was
even
scientific
he
boxed
in
the
american
manner
crouching
with
both
arms
half
extended
and
this
seems
to
have
entirely
bewildered
his
adversary
and
he
made
no
effort
to
reach
the
face
he
just
thumped
away
steadily
below
the
spot
where
the
ribs
part
and
where
a
doctor
informs
me
a
known
as
the
is
situated
he
revolved
too
with
considerable
agility
round
his
opponent
and
gradually
drew
the
battle
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
side
lane
outside
he
knew
enough
of
by
now
to
be
aware
that
if
a
sympathizer
or
sycophant
of
the
young
man
happened
to
be
present
he
himself
would
quite
possibly
if
the
friend
happened
to
possess
sufficient
courage
suddenly
collapse
from
a
disabling
blow
on
the
back
of
the
neck
also
he
was
not
sure
whether
there
was
any
wife
in
the
question
and
in
this
case
it
would
be
a
poker
or
a
broken
bottle
held
that
he
would
have
to
meet
and
he
wished
therefore
to
have
more
room
round
him
than
the
afforded
but
there
was
no
need
for
precaution
the
young
man
had
begun
to
look
rather
sickly
under
the
eyes
and
to
hiccup
three
or
four
times
in
distressed
manner
when
suddenly
the
clamor
round
the
fight
ceased
frank
was
aware
of
a
shrill
old
voice
calling
out
something
behind
him
and
the
next
instant
simultaneously
with
the
dropping
of
his
adversary
hands
he
himself
was
seized
from
behind
by
the
arms
and
writhing
discerned
is
blue
sleeve
and
a
gloved
hand
holding
him
now
what
all
this
said
a
voice
in
his
ear
there
was
a
chorus
of
explanation
declaring
that
had
been
set
upon
without
provocation
there
was
a
particularly
voluble
woman
with
red
arms
and
an
exceedingly
persuasive
manner
who
advanced
from
a
doorway
and
described
the
incident
from
her
own
point
of
view
she
had
been
hanging
out
the
children
things
she
began
and
so
forth
and
frank
was
declared
the
aggressor
and
the
innocent
victim
then
the
chorus
broke
out
again
and
after
another
fit
of
hiccupping
corroborated
the
witnesses
in
a
broken
and
pathetically
indignant
voice
frank
tore
himself
from
one
embracing
arm
and
faced
round
still
held
by
the
other
all
right
i
sha
run
away
look
here
that
a
black
lie
he
was
hitting
that
old
man
where
is
he
come
on
uncle
and
tell
us
all
about
it
the
old
man
advanced
his
toothless
face
contorted
with
inexplicable
emotion
and
corroborated
the
woman
and
the
chorus
generally
with
astonishing
volubility
and
emphasis
you
old
fool
said
frank
curtly
what
are
you
afraid
of
let
have
the
truth
now
was
he
hitting
you
he
he
he
giggled
the
old
man
torn
by
the
desire
of
on
one
side
and
let
us
hope
by
a
wish
for
justice
on
the
other
he
war
hittin
of
me
he
my
son
he
is
is
we
were
just
having
there
get
out
of
this
said
the
policeman
releasing
frank
with
a
shove
we
do
want
your
sort
here
coming
and
making
trouble
yes
my
lad
you
need
look
at
me
like
that
i
know
you
who
the
deuce
are
you
talking
to
snapped
frank
i
know
who
i
talking
to
well
enough
pronounced
the
policeman
judicially
gregory
ai
it
now
you
be
off
out
of
this
or
be
in
trouble
again
there
was
something
vaguely
kindly
about
the
man
manner
and
frank
understood
that
he
knew
very
tolerably
where
the
truth
lay
but
wished
to
prevent
further
disturbance
he
gulped
down
his
fury
it
was
no
good
saying
anything
but
the
dense
of
the
injustice
of
the
universe
was
very
bitter
he
turned
away
a
murmur
of
indignation
broke
out
from
the
crowd
bidding
the
policeman
do
his
duty
and
as
frank
went
up
the
lane
he
heard
that
zealous
officer
addressing
the
court
with
considerable
vigor
but
it
was
very
little
comfort
to
him
he
walked
out
of
the
town
with
his
anger
and
resentment
still
hot
in
his
heart
at
the
indignity
of
the
whole
affair
v
by
the
sunday
afternoon
frank
was
well
on
his
way
to
york
it
was
a
heavy
hot
day
sunny
but
with
brooding
clouds
on
the
low
horizons
and
he
was
dispirited
and
tired
as
he
came
at
last
into
a
small
prim
village
street
rather
after
two
its
name
once
more
i
suppress
his
possessions
by
now
were
greatly
reduced
his
money
had
gone
little
by
little
all
through
his
journey
with
the
major
and
he
had
kept
of
other
things
only
one
extra
flannel
shirt
a
pair
of
thick
socks
and
a
small
saucepan
he
had
bought
one
day
the
that
the
governor
had
given
him
was
gone
all
but
fourpence
and
he
wanted
if
possible
to
arrive
at
york
where
he
was
to
meet
the
major
at
least
with
that
sum
in
his
possession
twopence
would
pay
for
a
bed
and
twopence
more
for
supper
up
the
street
he
stopped
suddenly
opposite
him
stood
a
small
brick
church
retired
by
a
few
yards
of
turf
crossed
by
a
path
from
the
iron
railings
that
abutted
on
the
pavement
and
a
proclaimed
that
in
this
church
of
the
sacred
heart
mass
was
said
on
sundays
at
eleven
on
holidays
of
obligation
at
nine
and
on
weekdays
at
confessions
were
heard
on
saturday
evenings
and
on
thursday
evenings
before
the
first
friday
from
eight
to
nine
catechism
was
at
three
on
sundays
and
rosary
sermon
and
benediction
at
seven
a
fat
cat
looking
as
if
it
were
dead
lay
relaxed
on
the
grass
beneath
this
board
the
door
was
open
and
frank
considered
an
instant
but
he
thought
that
could
wait
for
a
few
minutes
as
he
glanced
at
the
next
house
this
was
obviously
the
presbytery
frank
had
never
begged
from
a
priest
before
and
he
hesitated
a
little
now
then
he
went
across
the
street
into
the
shadow
on
the
other
side
leaned
against
the
wall
and
looked
the
street
was
perfectly
empty
and
perfectly
quiet
and
the
hot
summer
air
and
sunshine
lay
on
all
like
a
charm
there
was
another
cat
he
noticed
on
a
doorstep
a
few
yards
away
and
he
wondered
how
any
living
creature
in
this
heat
could
possibly
lie
like
that
face
coiled
round
to
the
feet
and
the
tail
laid
neatly
across
the
nose
a
dreaming
cock
crooned
somewhere
out
of
sight
and
a
little
hot
breeze
scooped
up
a
feather
of
dust
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
dropped
again
even
the
presbytery
looked
inviting
on
a
day
like
this
he
had
walked
a
good
miles
and
the
suggestion
of
a
dark
cool
room
was
delicious
it
was
a
little
house
of
brick
like
the
church
squeezed
between
the
church
and
a
large
grocery
with
a
flamboyant
inscription
over
its
closed
shutters
all
the
windows
were
open
hung
inside
with
cheap
lace
curtains
and
protected
with
he
pictured
the
cold
food
probably
laid
out
within
and
his
imagination
struck
into
being
a
tall
glass
jug
of
something
like
still
frank
had
not
dined
then
he
limped
boldly
across
the
street
rapped
with
the
knocker
and
waited
nothing
at
all
happened
presently
the
cat
from
the
appeared
round
the
corner
eyed
frank
suspiciously
decided
that
he
was
not
dangerous
came
on
walking
delicately
stepped
up
on
to
the
further
end
of
the
brick
stair
and
began
to
arch
itself
about
and
rub
its
back
against
the
warm
angle
of
the
doorpost
frank
rapped
again
interrupting
the
cat
for
an
instant
and
then
stooped
down
to
scratch
it
under
the
ear
the
cat
crooned
delightedly
steps
sounded
inside
the
house
the
cat
stopped
writhing
and
as
the
door
opened
darted
in
noiselessly
with
tail
erect
past
the
woman
who
held
the
door
uninvitingly
half
open
she
had
a
thin
lined
face
and
quick
black
eyes
what
do
you
want
she
asked
sharply
looking
up
and
down
figure
with
suspicion
her
eyes
dwelt
for
a
moment
on
the
bruise
on
his
i
want
to
see
the
priest
please
said
frank
you
ca
see
him
i
am
very
sorry
said
frank
but
i
must
see
him
coming
here
begging
exclaimed
the
woman
bitterly
i
be
ashamed
be
off
with
you
frank
dignity
asserted
itself
a
little
do
speak
to
me
in
that
tone
please
i
am
a
catholic
and
i
wish
to
see
the
priest
the
woman
snorted
but
before
she
could
speak
there
came
the
sound
of
an
opening
door
and
a
quick
step
on
the
linoleum
of
the
little
dark
passage
what
all
this
said
a
voice
as
the
woman
stepped
back
he
was
a
big
florid
young
man
with
yellow
hair
flushed
as
if
with
sleep
his
eyes
were
bright
and
and
his
collar
was
plainly
unbuttoned
at
the
back
also
his
cassock
was
unfastened
at
the
throat
and
he
bore
a
large
red
handkerchief
in
his
hand
obviously
this
had
just
been
over
his
face
now
i
do
not
blame
this
priest
in
the
slightest
he
had
sung
a
late
mass
which
never
agreed
with
him
and
in
his
extreme
hunger
he
had
eaten
two
platefuls
of
hot
beef
with
yorkshire
pudding
and
drunk
a
glass
and
a
half
of
solid
beer
and
he
had
just
fallen
into
a
deep
sleep
before
giving
catechism
when
the
footsteps
and
voices
had
awakened
him
further
every
wastrel
catholic
that
came
along
this
road
paid
him
a
call
and
he
had
not
yet
met
with
one
genuine
case
of
want
when
he
had
first
come
here
he
had
helped
beggars
freely
and
generously
and
he
lived
on
a
stipend
of
ninety
pounds
a
year
out
of
which
he
paid
his
housekeeper
fifteen
what
do
you
want
he
said
may
i
speak
to
you
father
said
frank
certainly
say
what
you
got
to
say
will
you
help
me
with
sixpence
father
the
priest
was
silent
eyeing
frank
closely
are
you
a
catholic
yes
father
i
did
see
you
at
mass
this
morning
i
was
here
this
morning
i
was
walking
on
the
roads
where
did
you
hear
mass
i
did
hear
it
at
all
father
i
was
on
the
roads
what
your
work
i
have
any
why
that
frank
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
little
i
do
it
when
i
can
get
it
he
said
you
speak
like
an
educated
man
i
am
pretty
well
educated
the
priest
laughed
shortly
what
that
bruise
on
your
cheek
i
was
in
a
street
fight
yesterday
father
oh
this
is
ridiculous
he
said
where
did
you
come
from
last
frank
paused
a
moment
he
was
very
hot
and
very
tired
then
he
spoke
i
was
in
prison
till
friday
he
said
i
was
given
fourteen
days
on
the
charge
of
robbing
a
child
on
the
i
pleaded
guilty
will
you
help
me
father
if
the
priest
had
not
been
still
half
stupid
with
sleep
and
indigestion
and
standing
in
the
full
blaze
of
this
hot
sun
he
might
have
been
rather
struck
by
this
last
sentence
but
he
did
have
those
disadvantages
and
he
saw
in
it
nothing
but
insolence
he
laughed
again
shortly
and
angrily
i
amazed
at
your
cheek
he
said
no
certainly
not
and
better
learn
manners
before
you
beg
again
then
he
banged
the
door
about
ten
minutes
later
he
woke
up
from
a
doze
very
wide
awake
indeed
and
looked
round
there
lay
on
the
table
by
him
a
dutch
cheese
a
large
crusty
piece
of
bread
and
some
very
soft
salt
butter
in
a
saucer
there
was
also
a
good
glass
of
beer
left
not
in
a
glass
jug
very
much
as
frank
had
pictured
it
he
got
up
and
went
out
to
the
street
door
shading
his
eyes
against
the
sun
but
the
street
lay
hot
and
dusty
in
the
afternoon
light
empty
from
end
to
end
except
for
a
cat
nose
in
tail
coiled
on
the
grocery
then
he
saw
two
children
in
white
frocks
appear
round
a
corner
and
he
remembered
that
it
was
close
on
time
for
catechism
chapter
vi
i
about
the
time
that
frank
was
coming
into
the
village
where
the
priest
lived
jenny
had
just
finished
lunch
with
her
father
she
took
a
book
two
cigarettes
a
small
silver
matchbox
and
a
japanese
fan
and
went
out
into
the
garden
she
had
no
duties
this
afternoon
she
had
played
the
organ
admirably
at
the
morning
service
and
would
play
it
equally
admirably
at
the
evening
service
the
afternoon
devotions
in
the
little
hot
sunday
school
she
had
decided
in
company
with
her
father
a
year
or
two
ago
and
the
management
of
the
children
were
far
better
left
in
the
professional
hands
of
the
schoolmistress
she
went
straight
out
of
the
windows
set
wide
and
shaded
by
awnings
and
across
the
lawn
to
the
seat
below
the
ancient
yews
there
she
disposed
herself
with
her
feet
up
lit
a
cigarette
buried
the
match
and
began
to
read
she
had
not
heard
from
frank
for
nearly
three
weeks
his
last
communication
had
been
a
picture
postcard
of
selby
abbey
with
the
initial
f
neatly
printed
at
the
back
but
she
was
not
very
greatly
upset
she
had
written
her
letter
as
she
had
promised
and
had
heard
from
jack
kirkby
to
whose
care
she
sent
it
that
he
had
no
idea
of
frank
whereabouts
and
that
he
would
send
on
the
letter
as
soon
as
he
knew
more
she
supposed
that
frank
would
communicate
with
her
again
as
soon
as
he
thought
proper
other
circumstances
to
be
noted
were
that
dick
had
gone
back
to
town
some
while
ago
but
would
return
almost
immediately
now
for
the
that
archie
and
lord
talgarth
were
both
up
at
the
house
indeed
she
had
caught
sight
of
them
in
the
this
morning
and
had
exchanged
five
words
with
them
both
after
the
service
and
that
in
all
other
respects
other
things
were
as
they
had
been
a
month
ago
the
dean
of
trinity
had
telegraphed
in
great
dismay
on
the
morning
following
his
first
communication
that
frank
had
gone
and
that
no
one
had
the
slightest
idea
of
his
destination
he
had
asked
whether
he
should
put
detectives
on
the
track
and
had
been
bidden
in
return
politely
but
quite
firmly
to
mind
his
own
business
and
leave
lord
talgarth
younger
son
to
lord
talgarth
it
was
a
sleepy
afternoon
even
up
here
among
the
hills
and
jenny
had
not
read
many
pages
before
she
became
aware
of
it
the
rectory
garden
was
an
almost
perfect
place
for
a
small
doze
the
yews
about
her
made
a
grateful
shade
and
the
limes
behind
them
even
further
cooled
the
air
and
when
the
breeze
awoke
as
one
talking
in
his
sleep
the
sound
about
her
was
as
of
gentle
rain
the
air
was
bright
and
dusty
with
insects
from
the
limes
overhead
the
geranium
beds
and
the
orchard
fifty
yards
away
came
the
steady
murmur
of
bees
and
flies
jenny
woke
up
twenty
minutes
later
with
a
sudden
start
and
saw
someone
standing
almost
over
her
she
threw
her
feet
down
still
bewildered
by
the
sudden
change
and
the
glare
on
which
she
opened
her
eyes
and
perceived
that
it
was
jack
kirkby
looking
very
dusty
and
hot
i
am
so
sorry
said
jack
apologetically
but
i
was
told
you
were
out
here
she
did
not
know
jack
very
well
though
she
had
known
him
a
long
time
she
looked
upon
him
as
a
pleasant
sort
of
boy
whom
she
occasionally
met
at
parties
and
flower
shows
and
things
like
that
and
she
knew
perfectly
how
to
talk
to
young
men
how
nice
of
you
to
came
over
she
said
did
you
bicycle
have
something
to
drink
she
made
room
for
him
on
the
seat
and
held
out
her
second
cigarette
it
your
last
said
jack
i
lots
more
in
the
house
she
watched
him
as
he
lit
it
and
as
the
last
shreds
of
sleep
rolled
away
put
the
obvious
question
you
news
of
frank
jack
threw
away
the
match
and
drew
two
or
three
draughts
of
smoke
before
answering
yes
he
said
where
is
he
he
gave
an
address
at
york
though
he
was
there
when
he
wrote
i
sent
your
letter
on
there
yesterday
oh
i
did
he
give
any
account
of
himself
jack
looked
at
her
well
he
did
i
come
about
that
it
not
very
pleasant
is
he
ill
asked
jenny
sharply
oh
no
not
at
all
at
least
he
did
say
so
what
the
matter
then
jack
fumbled
in
his
and
drew
out
a
letter
which
he
held
a
moment
before
unfolding
i
think
you
better
read
what
he
says
miss
launton
it
pleasant
but
it
all
over
now
i
thought
i
better
tell
you
that
first
she
held
out
her
hand
without
speaking
jack
gave
it
her
and
addressed
himself
carefully
to
his
cigarette
he
did
like
this
kind
of
thing
at
all
he
wished
frank
would
give
him
unpleasant
commissions
but
of
course
it
had
to
be
done
he
looked
out
at
the
lawn
and
the
sleepy
house
but
was
aware
of
nothing
except
the
girl
beside
him
in
her
white
dress
and
the
letter
in
her
hands
when
she
had
finished
it
she
turned
back
and
read
it
again
then
she
remained
perfectly
still
with
the
letter
held
on
her
knee
poor
dear
old
boy
she
said
suddenly
and
quietly
an
enormous
wave
of
relief
rolled
up
and
enveloped
jack
he
had
been
exceedingly
uncomfortable
this
morning
ever
since
the
letter
had
come
his
first
impulse
had
been
to
ride
over
instantly
after
breakfast
then
he
had
postponed
it
till
lunch
then
he
had
eaten
some
cold
beef
about
twelve
and
come
straight
away
he
told
himself
he
must
give
her
plenty
of
time
to
write
by
the
late
sunday
night
post
he
had
not
exactly
distrusted
jenny
frank
confidence
was
too
overwhelming
and
too
infectious
but
he
had
reflected
that
it
was
not
a
wholly
pleasant
errand
to
have
to
inform
a
girl
that
her
lover
had
been
in
prison
for
a
fortnight
but
the
tone
in
which
she
had
just
said
those
four
words
was
so
serene
and
so
compassionate
that
he
was
completely
reassured
this
really
was
a
fine
creature
he
said
to
himself
i
extraordinarily
glad
you
take
it
like
that
he
said
jenny
looked
at
him
out
of
her
clear
direct
eyes
you
did
suppose
i
should
abuse
him
did
you
how
exactly
like
frank
i
suppose
he
did
it
to
save
some
blackguard
or
other
i
expect
that
was
it
said
jack
poor
dear
old
boy
she
said
again
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
jack
began
again
you
see
i
got
to
go
and
tell
lord
talgarth
miss
launton
i
wish
you
come
with
me
then
we
can
both
write
by
post
jenny
said
nothing
for
an
instant
then
i
suppose
that
would
be
best
she
said
shall
we
go
up
pretty
soon
i
expect
we
shall
find
him
in
the
garden
jack
winced
a
little
jenny
smiled
at
him
openly
best
to
get
it
over
jack
i
know
it
like
going
to
the
dentist
but
it
ca
be
as
bad
as
you
think
it
never
is
besides
you
have
somebody
to
hold
your
hand
so
to
speak
i
hope
i
sha
scream
out
loud
observed
jack
yes
we
better
go
if
you
do
mind
he
stood
up
and
waited
jenny
rose
at
once
i
go
and
get
a
hat
wait
for
me
here
will
you
i
need
tell
father
till
this
evening
ii
the
park
looked
delicious
as
they
walked
slowly
up
the
grass
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
by
the
side
of
the
drive
the
great
beeches
and
elms
rose
in
towering
masses
in
clump
after
clump
into
the
distance
and
beneath
the
nearest
stood
a
great
stag
with
half
a
dozen
hinds
about
him
eyeing
the
walkers
the
air
was
very
still
only
from
over
the
hill
came
the
sound
of
a
single
church
bell
where
some
infatuated
clergyman
hoped
to
gather
the
lambs
of
his
flock
together
for
instruction
in
the
christian
religion
that
a
beauty
said
jack
waving
a
languid
hand
towards
the
stag
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
row
frank
and
i
got
into
when
we
were
boys
jenny
smiled
she
had
been
quite
silent
since
leaving
the
rectory
i
heard
of
a
good
many
she
said
which
was
this
jack
recounted
a
story
of
red
indians
and
ambuscades
and
a
bow
and
arrows
ending
in
the
flight
of
a
frantic
stag
over
the
palings
and
among
the
garden
beds
it
was
on
a
sunday
afternoon
too
frank
was
caned
by
the
butler
i
remember
by
lord
talgarth
express
orders
certainly
he
richly
deserved
it
i
was
a
guest
and
got
off
clear
how
old
were
you
we
were
both
about
eleven
i
think
frank
does
strike
me
as
more
than
about
twelve
now
observed
jenny
there
something
in
that
admitted
jack
oh
lord
how
hot
it
is
he
fanned
himself
with
his
hat
there
was
no
sign
of
life
as
they
passed
into
the
court
and
up
to
the
pillared
portico
and
at
last
when
the
butler
appeared
the
irregular
state
of
his
showed
plainly
that
he
but
that
moment
had
put
his
coat
on
this
would
be
about
the
time
that
frank
left
the
village
after
his
interview
with
the
priest
yes
it
seemed
that
lord
talgarth
was
probably
in
the
garden
and
if
so
almost
certainly
in
the
little
square
among
the
yews
along
the
upper
terrace
his
lordship
usually
went
there
on
hot
days
would
miss
launton
and
kirkby
kindly
step
this
way
no
he
was
not
to
trouble
they
would
find
their
own
way
on
the
upper
terrace
on
the
upper
terrace
miss
the
upper
terrace
was
the
one
part
of
the
old
elizabethan
garden
left
entirely
unaltered
on
either
side
rose
up
a
giant
wall
of
yew
shaped
like
a
castle
bastion
at
least
ten
feet
thick
and
between
the
two
ran
a
broad
gravel
path
up
to
the
bordered
on
either
side
by
huge
herbaceous
beds
blazing
with
the
color
of
late
summer
in
two
or
three
places
grass
paths
crossed
these
leading
by
a
few
yards
of
turf
to
windows
cut
in
the
hedge
to
give
a
view
of
the
long
dazzling
lake
below
and
there
was
one
gravel
path
parallel
to
these
that
led
to
the
little
square
built
out
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
two
very
silent
persons
now
came
out
from
the
house
by
the
garden
door
on
the
south
side
turned
along
the
path
went
up
a
dozen
broad
steps
passed
up
the
yew
walk
and
finally
turned
again
down
the
short
gravel
way
and
stood
abashed
his
lordship
was
indeed
here
a
long
wicker
chair
was
set
in
one
angle
facing
them
in
such
a
position
that
the
movement
of
the
sun
would
not
affect
the
delightful
shade
in
which
the
chair
stood
a
small
table
stood
beside
it
with
the
newspaper
tumbled
on
to
it
a
box
of
cigars
a
of
iridescent
glass
a
syphon
and
a
tall
tumbler
in
which
a
little
ice
lay
crumbled
at
the
bottom
and
in
the
wicker
chair
with
his
mouth
wide
open
slept
lord
talgarth
good
gracious
whispered
jenny
there
was
a
silence
and
then
like
thunder
a
slow
meditative
snore
it
was
not
an
object
of
beauty
or
dignity
that
they
looked
upon
in
one
second
i
shall
laugh
asserted
jenny
still
in
a
cautious
whisper
i
think
we
better
began
jack
and
stopped
petrified
to
see
one
eye
opened
and
regarding
him
it
seemed
with
an
expression
of
extraordinary
malignity
then
the
other
eye
opened
the
mouth
abruptly
closed
and
lord
talgarth
sat
up
god
bless
my
soul
he
rolled
his
eyes
about
a
moment
while
intelligence
came
back
you
need
be
ashamed
of
it
said
jenny
jack
kirkby
caught
me
at
it
too
half
an
hour
ago
his
lordship
senses
had
not
even
now
quite
returned
he
still
stared
at
them
innocently
like
a
child
cleared
his
throat
once
or
twice
and
finally
stood
up
jack
kirkby
so
it
is
how
do
jack
and
jenny
that
who
we
are
said
jenny
are
you
sure
you
quite
recovered
recovered
eh
he
emitted
a
short
laugh
sit
down
there
chairs
somewhere
jack
hooked
out
a
couple
that
were
leaning
folded
against
the
low
wall
of
yew
beneath
the
window
and
set
them
down
have
a
cigar
jack
no
thanks
they
were
on
good
terms
these
two
jack
shot
really
well
and
was
smart
and
deferential
lord
talgarth
asked
no
more
than
this
from
a
young
man
well
what
the
matter
jack
left
it
thoughtfully
for
jenny
to
open
the
campaign
she
did
so
very
adroitly
jack
came
over
to
see
me
she
said
and
i
thought
i
entertain
him
better
than
by
bringing
him
up
to
see
you
you
such
a
thing
as
a
cigarette
lord
talgarth
he
felt
about
in
his
pockets
drew
out
a
case
and
pushed
it
across
the
table
thanks
said
jenny
and
then
without
the
faintest
change
of
tone
we
some
news
of
frank
at
last
frank
eh
have
you
and
what
the
young
cub
at
now
he
in
trouble
as
usual
poor
boy
remarked
jenny
genially
very
well
thank
you
and
sends
you
his
love
lord
talgarth
cast
her
a
pregnant
glance
well
if
he
did
i
sure
he
meant
to
went
on
jenny
but
i
expect
he
forgot
you
see
he
been
in
prison
the
old
man
jerked
such
a
face
at
her
that
even
her
nerve
failed
for
an
instant
jack
saw
her
put
her
cigarette
up
to
her
mouth
with
a
hand
that
shook
ever
so
slightly
and
yet
before
the
other
could
say
one
word
she
recovered
herself
please
let
me
say
it
right
out
to
the
end
first
she
said
no
please
do
interrupt
jack
give
me
the
letter
oh
i
got
it
she
drew
it
out
and
began
to
unfold
it
talking
all
the
while
with
astonishing
smoothness
and
and
i
read
you
all
the
important
part
it
written
to
kirkby
he
got
it
this
morning
and
very
kindly
brought
it
straight
over
here
at
once
jack
was
watching
like
a
terrier
on
the
one
side
he
saw
emotions
so
furious
and
so
conflicting
that
they
could
find
no
expression
and
on
the
other
a
restraint
and
a
personality
so
complete
and
so
compelling
that
they
simply
held
the
field
and
permitted
no
outburst
her
voice
was
cool
and
high
and
natural
then
he
noticed
her
flick
a
glance
at
himself
sideways
and
yet
perfectly
intelligible
he
stood
up
yes
do
just
take
a
stroll
kirkby
come
back
in
ten
minutes
and
as
he
passed
out
again
through
the
thick
archway
on
to
the
terrace
he
heard
in
an
incredibly
voice
the
letter
begin
dear
jack
then
he
began
to
wonder
what
as
a
matter
of
interest
lord
first
utterance
would
be
but
he
felt
he
could
trust
jenny
to
manage
him
she
was
an
astonishingly
sane
and
sensible
girl
iii
he
was
at
the
further
end
of
the
terrace
close
beneath
the
stable
wall
when
the
stable
clock
struck
the
quarter
for
the
second
time
that
would
make
he
calculated
about
seventeen
minutes
and
he
turned
reluctantly
to
keep
his
appointment
but
he
was
still
thirty
yards
away
from
the
opening
when
a
white
figure
in
a
huge
white
hat
came
quickly
out
she
beckoned
to
him
with
her
head
and
he
followed
her
down
the
steps
she
gave
him
one
glance
as
if
to
reassure
him
as
he
caught
her
up
but
said
not
a
word
good
or
bad
till
they
had
passed
through
the
house
again
and
were
well
on
their
way
down
the
drive
well
said
jack
jenny
hesitated
a
moment
i
suppose
anyone
else
would
have
called
him
violent
she
said
poor
old
dear
but
it
seems
to
me
he
behaved
rather
well
on
the
whole
considering
all
things
what
he
going
to
do
if
one
took
anything
he
said
as
containing
any
truth
at
all
it
would
mean
that
he
was
going
to
flog
frank
with
his
own
hands
kick
him
first
up
the
steps
of
the
house
then
down
again
and
finally
drown
him
in
the
lake
with
a
stone
round
his
neck
i
think
that
was
the
sort
of
programme
but
oh
we
need
be
frightened
said
jenny
but
if
you
ask
me
what
he
will
do
i
have
the
faintest
idea
did
you
suggest
anything
he
knows
what
my
views
are
said
jenny
and
those
well
make
him
a
decent
allowance
and
let
him
alone
he
wo
do
that
said
jack
that
far
too
sensible
you
think
so
that
would
solve
the
whole
problem
of
course
went
on
jack
marriage
and
everything
i
suppose
it
would
have
to
be
about
eight
hundred
a
year
and
talgarth
must
have
at
least
thirty
thousand
oh
he
more
than
that
said
jenny
he
gives
dick
twelve
hundred
there
was
a
pause
jack
did
not
know
what
to
think
he
was
only
quite
certain
that
the
thing
would
have
been
far
worse
if
he
had
attempted
to
manage
it
himself
well
what
shall
i
say
to
frank
he
asked
jenny
paused
again
it
seems
to
me
the
best
thing
for
you
to
do
is
not
to
write
i
write
myself
this
evening
if
you
give
me
his
address
and
explain
i
ca
do
that
said
jack
i
awfully
sorry
but
you
ca
give
me
his
address
no
i
afraid
i
must
you
see
frank
very
particular
in
his
letter
then
how
can
i
write
to
him
kirkby
you
really
rather
by
george
i
got
it
cried
jack
if
you
do
mind
my
waiting
at
the
rectory
why
should
you
write
to
him
now
and
let
me
take
the
letter
away
and
post
it
it
go
all
the
quicker
too
from
barham
he
glanced
at
her
wondering
whether
she
were
displeased
her
answer
reassured
him
that
do
perfectly
she
said
if
you
sure
you
do
mind
waiting
the
rectory
garden
seemed
more
than
ever
a
harbor
from
storm
as
they
turned
into
it
the
sun
was
a
little
lower
now
and
the
whole
lawn
lay
in
shadow
as
they
came
to
the
door
she
stopped
i
think
i
better
go
and
get
it
over
she
said
i
can
tell
father
all
about
it
after
you
gone
will
you
go
now
and
wait
there
she
nodded
towards
the
seat
where
they
had
sat
together
earlier
but
it
was
nearly
an
hour
before
she
came
out
again
and
a
neat
maid
in
apron
and
cap
had
come
discreetly
out
with
the
set
them
down
and
retired
jack
had
been
thinking
of
a
hundred
things
which
all
centered
round
one
frank
he
had
had
a
real
shock
this
morning
it
had
been
intolerable
to
think
of
frank
in
prison
for
even
jack
could
guess
something
of
what
that
meant
to
him
and
the
tone
of
the
letter
had
been
so
utterly
unlike
what
he
had
been
accustomed
to
from
his
friend
he
would
have
expected
a
bubbling
torrent
of
remarks
wise
and
foolish
full
of
personal
descriptions
and
unkind
little
sketches
and
indeed
there
had
come
this
sober
narration
of
facts
and
requests
but
in
all
this
there
was
one
deep
relief
that
it
should
be
a
girl
like
jenny
who
was
the
heart
of
the
situation
if
she
had
been
in
the
least
little
bit
disturbed
who
could
tell
what
it
would
mean
to
frank
for
frank
as
he
knew
perfectly
well
had
a
very
deep
heart
indeed
and
had
enshrined
jenny
in
the
middle
of
it
any
wavering
or
hesitation
on
her
part
would
have
meant
misery
to
his
friend
but
now
all
was
perfectly
right
he
reflected
and
really
after
all
it
did
not
matter
very
much
what
lord
talgarth
said
or
did
frank
was
a
free
agent
he
was
very
capable
and
very
lovable
it
could
possibly
be
long
before
something
turned
up
and
then
with
jenny
own
money
the
two
could
manage
very
well
and
lord
talgarth
could
not
live
for
ever
and
archie
would
do
the
right
thing
even
if
his
father
did
it
was
after
four
before
he
looked
up
at
a
glint
of
white
and
saw
jenny
standing
at
the
window
she
stood
there
an
instant
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
then
she
stepped
over
the
low
sill
and
came
towards
him
across
the
grass
serene
and
dignified
and
graceful
her
head
was
bare
again
and
the
great
coils
of
her
hair
flashed
suddenly
as
they
caught
a
long
horizontal
ray
from
the
west
here
it
is
she
said
will
you
direct
it
i
told
him
everything
jack
nodded
that
excellent
he
said
it
shall
go
he
glanced
up
at
her
and
saw
her
looking
at
him
with
just
the
faintest
wistfulness
he
understood
perfectly
he
said
to
himself
she
was
still
a
little
unhappy
at
not
being
allowed
to
send
the
letter
herself
what
a
good
girl
she
was
have
some
tea
before
you
go
she
said
thanks
i
better
not
they
be
wondering
what
happened
to
me
as
he
shook
hands
he
tried
to
put
something
of
his
sympathy
into
his
look
he
knew
exactly
how
she
was
feeling
and
he
thought
her
splendidly
brave
but
she
hardly
met
his
eyes
and
again
he
felt
he
knew
why
as
he
opened
the
garden
gate
beyond
the
house
he
turned
once
more
to
wave
but
she
was
busy
with
the
and
a
black
figure
was
advancing
briskly
upon
her
from
the
direction
of
the
study
end
of
the
house
chapter
vii
i
life
had
been
a
little
difficult
for
the
major
for
the
last
fortnight
or
so
not
only
was
frank
material
and
moral
support
lacking
to
him
but
the
calls
upon
him
owing
to
gertie
extreme
unreasonableness
had
considerably
increased
he
had
explained
to
her
over
and
over
again
with
a
rising
intensity
each
time
how
unselfishly
he
had
acted
throughout
how
his
sole
thought
had
been
for
her
in
his
recent
course
of
action
it
would
never
have
done
he
explained
pacifically
for
a
young
man
like
frank
to
have
the
responsibility
of
a
young
girl
like
gertie
on
his
hands
while
he
the
major
was
spending
a
fortnight
elsewhere
and
in
fact
even
on
the
most
economical
grounds
he
had
acted
for
the
best
since
it
had
been
himself
who
had
been
charged
in
the
matter
of
the
tin
of
salmon
it
would
not
have
been
a
fortnight
but
more
like
two
months
during
which
the
little
community
would
have
been
deprived
of
his
labor
he
reminded
her
that
frank
had
had
a
clean
record
up
to
that
time
with
the
police
but
explanation
had
been
fruitless
gertie
had
even
threatened
a
revelation
of
the
facts
of
the
case
at
the
nearest
and
the
major
had
been
forced
to
more
manly
tactics
with
her
he
had
not
used
a
stick
his
hands
had
served
him
very
well
and
in
the
course
of
his
argument
he
had
made
a
few
insincere
remarks
on
the
mutual
relations
of
frank
and
gertie
that
the
girl
remembered
he
had
obtained
a
frugal
little
lodging
in
one
of
the
small
streets
of
york
down
by
the
river
indeed
looking
straight
on
to
it
and
for
a
wonder
five
days
regular
work
at
the
unloading
of
a
string
of
barges
the
five
days
expired
on
the
saturday
before
frank
was
expected
but
he
had
several
shillings
in
hand
on
the
sunday
morning
when
frank
letter
arrived
announcing
that
he
hoped
to
be
with
them
again
on
sunday
night
or
monday
morning
two
letters
also
had
arrived
for
his
friend
on
the
sunday
morning
one
in
a
feminine
handwriting
and
with
an
old
postmark
of
june
as
well
as
one
of
the
day
before
he
had
held
it
up
to
the
light
and
crackled
it
between
his
fingers
of
course
upon
receiving
it
and
the
other
an
obvious
bill
one
postmark
was
cambridge
and
the
other
barham
he
decided
to
keep
them
both
intact
besides
gertie
had
been
present
at
their
delivery
the
major
spent
on
the
whole
an
enjoyable
sunday
he
lay
in
bed
till
a
little
after
twelve
with
a
copy
of
the
sporting
times
and
a
tin
of
tobacco
beside
him
they
dined
at
about
one
and
he
managed
to
get
a
little
spirit
to
drink
with
his
meal
he
had
walked
out
not
very
far
with
gertie
in
the
afternoon
and
had
managed
by
representing
himself
as
having
walked
seven
miles
he
was
determined
not
to
risk
anything
by
foolishly
cutting
it
too
fine
to
obtain
a
little
more
they
had
tea
about
six
and
ate
each
of
them
a
kippered
herring
and
some
watercress
then
about
seven
frank
suddenly
walked
in
and
sat
down
give
me
something
to
eat
and
drink
he
said
he
looked
indeed
extraordinarily
strained
and
tired
and
sat
back
on
the
upturned
box
by
the
fireplace
as
if
in
exhaustion
he
explained
presently
when
gertie
had
cooked
another
herring
and
he
had
drunk
a
of
tea
that
he
had
walked
fasting
since
breakfast
but
he
said
nothing
about
the
priest
the
major
with
an
air
of
great
preciseness
measured
out
half
a
finger
of
whisky
and
insisted
with
the
air
of
a
paternal
doctor
upon
his
drinking
it
immediately
and
now
a
cigarette
for
god
sake
said
frank
by
the
way
i
got
some
work
for
that
my
boy
said
the
major
i
been
working
myself
this
week
frank
produced
his
fourpence
and
laid
it
on
the
corner
of
the
table
that
for
supper
and
bed
he
said
nonsense
my
boy
put
it
back
in
your
pocket
kindly
take
that
fourpence
remarked
frank
you
can
add
some
breakfast
if
you
like
he
related
his
adventures
presently
always
excepting
the
priest
and
described
how
he
had
met
a
man
at
the
gate
of
a
builder
yard
this
evening
as
he
came
through
york
who
had
promised
him
a
day
job
and
if
things
were
satisfactory
more
to
follow
he
seemed
a
decent
chap
said
frank
the
major
and
gertie
had
not
much
to
relate
they
had
left
the
immediately
after
frank
little
matter
in
the
court
and
had
done
pretty
well
arriving
in
york
ten
days
ago
they
hardly
referred
to
frank
detention
though
he
saw
gertie
looking
at
him
once
or
twice
in
a
curiously
shy
kind
of
way
and
understood
what
was
in
her
mind
but
for
very
decency
sake
the
major
had
finally
to
say
something
by
the
way
my
boy
i
wo
forget
what
you
did
for
me
and
for
my
little
woman
here
i
not
a
man
of
many
words
but
oh
that
all
right
said
frank
sleepily
you
do
as
much
for
me
one
day
the
major
assented
with
fervor
and
moist
eyes
it
was
not
till
frank
stood
up
to
go
to
bed
that
anyone
remembered
the
letters
by
the
way
there
are
two
letters
come
for
you
said
the
major
hunting
in
the
drawer
of
the
table
frank
bearing
changed
he
whisked
round
in
an
instant
where
are
they
they
were
put
into
his
hand
he
looked
at
them
carefully
trying
to
make
out
the
postmark
turned
them
upside
down
and
round
but
he
made
no
motion
to
open
them
where
am
i
to
sleep
he
said
suddenly
and
can
you
spare
a
bit
of
candle
and
as
he
went
upstairs
it
must
have
been
just
about
the
time
that
the
at
barham
was
cleared
for
the
late
sunday
post
ii
frank
lay
a
long
time
awake
in
the
dark
that
night
holding
tight
in
his
hand
jenny
letter
written
to
him
in
june
the
bill
he
had
not
even
troubled
to
open
for
the
letter
said
exactly
and
perfectly
just
all
those
things
which
he
most
wished
to
hear
in
the
manner
in
which
he
wished
to
hear
them
it
laughed
at
him
gently
and
kindly
it
called
him
an
extraordinarily
silly
boy
it
said
that
his
leaving
cambridge
and
above
all
his
manner
of
leaving
it
frank
had
added
a
postscript
describing
his
adventure
with
the
saddle
and
the
policeman
were
precisely
what
the
writer
would
have
expected
of
him
it
made
delightful
and
humorous
reflections
upon
the
need
of
frank
turning
over
a
new
leaf
there
was
quite
a
page
of
good
advice
and
finally
it
gave
him
a
charming
description
just
not
over
the
line
of
due
respect
of
his
manner
of
receiving
the
news
with
extracts
from
some
of
the
choicest
remarks
made
upon
that
notable
occasion
it
occupied
four
pages
and
if
there
were
running
underneath
it
all
just
the
faintest
taint
of
strain
and
anxiety
loyally
concealed
well
that
made
the
letter
no
less
pleasant
i
have
not
said
a
great
deal
about
what
jenny
meant
to
frank
just
because
he
said
so
very
little
about
her
himself
she
was
in
fact
almost
the
only
element
in
his
variegated
life
upon
which
he
had
not
been
in
the
habit
of
pouring
out
torrential
comments
and
reflections
his
father
and
archie
were
not
at
all
spared
in
his
conversation
with
his
most
intimate
friends
in
fact
he
had
been
known
more
than
once
in
a
very
select
circle
at
cambridge
to
have
conducted
imaginary
dialogues
between
those
two
on
himself
as
their
subject
and
he
could
imitate
with
remarkable
fidelity
his
cousin
dick
over
a
but
he
practically
never
mentioned
jenny
he
had
not
even
a
photograph
of
her
on
his
mantelpiece
and
it
very
soon
became
known
among
his
friends
when
the
news
of
his
engagement
leaked
out
through
jack
that
it
was
not
to
be
spoken
of
in
his
presence
he
had
preserved
the
same
reticence
it
may
be
remembered
about
his
religion
and
so
frank
at
last
fell
asleep
on
a
little
iron
bedstead
just
remembering
that
it
was
quite
possible
he
might
have
another
letter
from
her
if
jack
had
performed
his
commission
immediately
but
he
hardly
expected
to
hear
till
tuesday
gertie
was
up
soon
after
five
next
morning
to
get
breakfast
for
her
men
since
the
major
had
announced
that
he
would
go
with
frank
to
see
whether
possibly
there
might
not
be
a
job
for
him
too
and
as
soon
as
they
had
gone
very
properly
went
to
sleep
again
on
the
bed
in
the
gertie
had
a
strenuous
time
of
it
in
spite
of
the
major
frequently
expressed
opinion
that
women
had
no
idea
what
work
was
for
first
there
was
the
almost
unending
labor
of
providing
food
and
cooking
it
as
well
as
possible
there
was
almost
a
standing
engagement
of
mending
and
washing
clothes
there
were
numerous
arguments
to
be
conducted
on
terms
of
comparative
equality
if
possible
with
landladies
or
wives
gertie
always
wore
a
brass
and
showed
it
sometimes
a
little
ostentatiously
and
finally
when
the
company
was
on
the
march
it
was
only
fair
that
she
should
carry
the
heavier
half
of
the
luggage
in
order
to
compensate
for
her
life
of
luxury
and
ease
at
other
times
gertie
then
was
usually
and
slept
whenever
she
could
get
a
chance
it
was
nearly
eight
before
she
was
awakened
again
by
sharp
knocking
on
her
door
and
on
opening
it
found
the
landlady
standing
there
examining
a
letter
with
great
attention
it
had
already
been
held
up
to
the
light
against
the
kitchen
window
for
one
of
your
folks
is
it
er
gertie
took
it
it
was
written
on
excellent
paper
and
directed
in
a
man
handwriting
to
gregory
thank
you
er
said
gertie
then
she
went
back
into
her
room
put
the
letter
carefully
away
in
the
drawer
of
the
table
and
set
about
her
household
business
about
eleven
she
stepped
out
for
a
little
refreshment
she
had
of
course
a
small
private
exchequer
of
her
own
amounting
usually
to
only
a
few
pence
of
which
the
major
knew
nothing
this
did
not
strike
her
as
at
all
unfair
she
only
wondered
gently
sometimes
at
masculine
innocence
in
not
recognizing
that
such
an
arrangement
was
perfectly
certain
she
got
into
conversation
with
some
elder
ladies
who
also
had
stepped
out
for
refreshment
and
had
occasion
at
a
certain
point
to
lay
her
on
the
for
exhibition
so
it
was
not
until
a
little
after
twelve
that
she
remembered
the
time
and
fled
she
was
not
expecting
her
men
home
to
dinner
in
fact
she
had
wrapped
up
provisions
for
them
in
fragments
of
the
major
before
they
had
left
but
it
was
safer
to
be
at
home
one
never
knew
as
she
came
into
the
room
for
an
instant
her
heart
leaped
into
her
mouth
but
it
was
only
frank
whatever
the
matter
she
said
turned
off
said
frank
shortly
he
was
sitting
gloomily
at
the
table
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
turned
off
he
nodded
what
up
said
frank
gertie
mouth
opened
a
little
one
of
them
saw
me
going
in
and
wired
for
instructions
he
had
seen
the
case
in
the
and
thought
i
answered
to
the
description
then
he
came
back
at
eleven
and
told
the
governor
and
yes
there
was
a
pause
and
george
oh
he
all
right
said
frank
a
little
bitterly
there
nothing
against
him
got
any
dinner
gertie
i
ca
pay
for
it
oh
yes
i
can
here
half
a
day
he
chucked
ninepence
upon
the
table
the
sixpence
rolled
off
again
but
he
made
no
movement
to
pick
it
up
gertie
looked
at
him
a
moment
well
she
began
emphatically
then
she
stooped
to
pick
up
the
sixpence
frank
sighed
oh
do
begin
all
that
there
a
good
girl
i
said
it
all
myself
quite
adequately
i
assure
you
gertie
mouth
opened
again
she
laid
the
sixpence
on
the
table
i
mean
there
nothing
to
be
said
explained
frank
the
point
is
what
to
be
done
gertie
had
no
suggestions
she
began
to
scrape
out
the
in
which
the
herrings
had
been
cooked
last
night
there
a
letter
for
you
she
said
suddenly
frank
sat
up
where
in
the
drawer
there
by
your
hand
frankie
frank
tore
at
the
handle
and
it
came
off
he
uttered
a
short
exclamation
then
with
infinite
craft
he
fitted
the
handle
in
again
wrapped
in
yet
one
more
scrap
of
the
and
drew
out
the
drawer
his
face
fell
abruptly
as
he
saw
the
handwriting
that
can
wait
he
muttered
and
chucked
the
letter
face
downwards
on
to
the
table
frankie
said
the
girl
again
still
intent
on
her
well
it
all
my
fault
she
said
in
a
low
voice
your
fault
how
do
you
make
that
out
if
it
had
been
for
me
you
would
have
taken
the
tin
from
george
and
oh
lord
said
frank
if
we
once
begin
on
that
and
if
it
been
for
george
he
would
have
taken
the
tin
and
if
it
had
been
for
maggie
cooper
there
would
have
been
the
tin
and
if
it
been
for
maggie
father
sister
she
would
have
gone
out
with
it
it
all
maggie
father
sister
fault
my
dear
it
nothing
to
do
with
you
the
words
were
brisk
enough
but
the
manner
was
very
heavy
it
was
like
repeating
a
lesson
learned
in
childhood
that
all
right
began
gertie
again
but
my
dear
girl
i
shall
be
annoyed
if
you
go
back
to
all
that
why
you
let
it
alone
the
point
is
what
to
happen
i
ca
go
on
sponging
on
you
and
the
major
gertie
flushed
under
her
tan
if
you
ever
leave
us
she
said
i
well
i
i
never
leave
george
frank
was
puzzled
for
a
moment
it
seemed
a
do
you
mean
i
got
me
eyes
said
gertie
emphatically
and
i
know
what
thinking
though
you
do
say
much
and
i
been
thinking
too
frank
felt
a
faint
warmth
rise
in
his
own
heart
you
mean
you
been
thinking
over
what
i
said
the
other
day
gertie
bent
lower
over
her
and
scraped
harder
than
ever
do
stop
that
confounded
row
one
second
shouted
frank
the
noise
stopped
abruptly
gertie
glanced
up
and
down
again
then
she
began
again
more
gently
that
better
said
frank
well
i
hope
you
have
he
went
on
paternally
you
a
good
girl
gertie
and
you
know
better
go
on
thinking
about
it
and
tell
me
when
you
made
up
your
mind
dinner
be
ready
half
an
hour
said
gertie
well
i
go
out
for
a
bit
and
look
round
he
took
up
the
letter
carelessly
and
went
out
iii
as
he
passed
the
window
gertie
glanced
towards
it
with
the
corner
of
her
eye
then
still
in
hand
she
crept
up
to
the
angle
and
watched
him
go
down
the
quay
a
very
convenient
barrel
was
set
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
embankment
above
the
water
with
another
beside
it
and
frank
made
for
this
immediately
she
saw
him
sit
on
one
of
the
barrels
and
put
the
letter
still
unopened
on
the
top
of
the
other
then
he
fumbled
in
his
pockets
a
little
and
presently
a
small
blue
cloud
of
smoke
went
upwards
like
incense
gertie
watched
him
for
an
instant
but
he
did
not
move
again
then
she
went
back
to
her
twenty
minutes
later
dinner
was
almost
ready
gertie
had
spread
upon
the
table
with
great
care
one
of
the
white
he
insisted
upon
those
being
not
only
retained
but
washed
occasionally
and
gertie
understood
something
of
his
reasons
since
in
the
corner
of
each
was
embroidered
a
monogram
of
which
the
letters
were
not
but
she
never
could
make
out
what
they
were
upon
this
tablecloth
she
had
placed
on
one
side
a
fork
with
two
prongs
and
a
knife
of
the
same
pattern
this
was
for
frank
and
on
the
other
a
small
pewter
and
a
knife
of
which
the
only
handle
was
a
small
iron
spike
from
which
the
wood
had
fallen
away
this
was
for
herself
then
there
was
a
for
frank
and
a
teacup
without
a
handle
but
with
a
gold
flower
in
the
middle
of
it
to
make
up
for
herself
in
the
center
of
the
stood
a
crockery
jug
with
a
mauve
design
of
york
minster
with
a
thundercloud
behind
it
and
a
lady
and
gentleman
with
a
child
bowling
a
hoop
in
front
of
it
this
was
the
landlady
property
and
was
half
full
of
beer
besides
all
this
there
were
two
plates
one
of
a
cold
blue
color
with
a
portrait
of
the
prince
consort
whiskers
and
hat
complete
in
a
small
medallion
in
the
center
and
the
other
white
with
a
representation
of
the
falls
of
lodore
there
was
no
possibility
of
mistaking
any
of
the
subjects
treated
upon
these
various
pieces
of
since
the
title
of
each
was
neatly
printed
in
various
styles
just
below
the
picture
gertie
regarded
this
array
with
her
head
on
one
side
it
was
not
often
that
they
dined
in
such
luxury
she
wished
she
had
a
flower
to
put
in
the
center
then
she
stirred
the
contents
of
the
with
an
iron
spoon
and
went
again
to
the
window
the
figure
on
the
barrel
had
not
moved
but
even
as
she
looked
she
saw
him
put
out
his
hand
to
the
letter
she
watched
him
she
saw
him
run
a
finger
inside
the
envelope
and
toss
the
envelope
over
the
edge
of
the
quay
then
she
saw
him
unfold
the
paper
inside
and
become
absorbed
this
would
never
do
gertie
idea
of
a
letter
was
that
it
occupied
at
least
several
minutes
to
read
through
so
she
went
out
quickly
to
the
street
door
to
call
him
in
she
called
him
and
he
did
not
turn
his
head
nor
even
answer
she
called
him
again
iv
the
letter
that
frank
read
lies
too
with
a
few
other
papers
before
me
as
i
write
it
runs
as
follows
my
dear
frank
i
know
you
wo
like
what
i
have
to
say
but
it
has
to
be
said
believe
me
it
costs
me
as
much
to
write
as
you
to
read
perhaps
more
it
is
this
our
engagement
must
be
at
an
end
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
ask
me
for
reasons
so
i
will
give
them
at
once
as
i
do
want
to
open
the
subject
again
it
would
do
no
kind
of
good
my
mind
is
absolutely
made
up
my
main
reason
is
this
when
i
became
engaged
to
you
i
did
not
know
you
properly
i
thought
you
were
quite
different
from
what
you
are
i
thought
that
underneath
all
your
nice
wildness
and
so
on
there
was
a
very
solid
person
and
i
hinted
that
you
will
remember
in
my
first
letter
which
i
suppose
you
have
received
just
before
this
and
now
i
simply
ca
think
that
any
longer
i
do
in
the
least
blame
you
for
being
what
you
are
not
my
business
but
i
must
just
say
this
that
a
man
who
can
do
what
you
done
not
only
for
a
week
or
two
as
i
thought
at
first
as
a
sort
of
game
but
for
nearly
three
months
and
during
that
time
could
leave
me
with
only
three
or
four
postcards
and
no
news
above
all
a
man
who
could
get
into
such
disgrace
and
trouble
and
actually
go
to
prison
and
yet
not
seem
to
mind
much
well
it
is
what
i
had
thought
of
you
you
see
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
things
together
it
just
this
or
that
but
the
whole
thing
first
you
became
a
catholic
without
telling
me
anything
until
just
before
i
did
like
that
naturally
but
i
did
say
anything
it
is
nice
for
a
husband
and
wife
to
be
of
different
religions
then
you
ran
away
from
cambridge
then
you
got
mixed
up
with
this
man
you
speak
of
in
your
letter
to
jack
and
you
must
have
been
rather
fond
of
him
you
know
to
go
to
prison
for
him
as
i
suppose
you
did
and
yet
after
all
that
i
expect
you
gone
to
meet
him
again
in
york
and
then
there
the
undeniable
fact
of
prison
you
see
it
all
these
things
together
one
after
another
i
have
defended
you
to
your
father
again
and
again
i
allowed
anybody
to
abuse
you
without
standing
up
for
you
but
it
really
has
gone
too
far
you
know
i
did
half
warn
you
in
that
other
letter
i
know
you
could
have
got
it
till
just
now
but
that
was
my
fault
and
the
letter
shows
what
i
was
thinking
even
three
months
ago
do
be
too
angry
with
me
frank
i
very
fond
of
you
still
and
i
shall
always
stand
up
for
you
when
i
can
and
please
do
answer
this
in
any
way
jack
kirkby
is
answering
just
yet
i
asked
him
not
though
he
does
know
why
your
father
is
going
to
send
the
news
that
the
engagement
is
broken
off
to
the
newspapers
yours
sincerely
jenny

chapter
i
i
barham
as
all
yorkshire
knows
lies
at
the
foot
of
a
long
valley
where
it
emerges
into
the
flatter
district
round
harrogate
it
has
a
railway
all
to
itself
which
goes
no
further
for
barham
is
shut
in
on
the
north
by
tall
hills
and
moors
and
lies
on
the
way
to
nowhere
it
is
almost
wholly
an
agricultural
town
and
has
a
curious
humped
bridge
right
in
the
middle
of
the
town
where
men
stand
about
on
market
days
and
discuss
the
price
of
bullocks
it
has
two
churches
one
disused
on
a
precipitous
spur
above
the
town
surrounded
by
an
amazingly
irregular
sort
of
churchyard
full
literally
to
bursting
the
kirkbys
lie
there
generation
after
generation
of
them
beneath
pompous
tombs
and
the
other
church
a
hideous
rectangular
building
with
flat
walls
and
shallow
sham
gothic
windows
it
was
thought
extremely
beautiful
when
it
was
built
forty
years
ago
the
town
itself
is
an
irregular
and
rather
picturesque
place
with
a
twisting
steep
high
street
looking
as
if
a
number
of
houses
had
been
shot
at
random
into
this
nook
among
the
hills
and
left
to
find
their
own
levels
the
big
house
where
the
kirkbys
have
lived
since
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
is
close
to
the
town
as
the
squire
house
ought
to
be
and
its
park
gates
open
right
upon
the
northern
end
of
the
old
bridge
there
nothing
of
great
interest
in
the
house
i
believe
there
is
an
old
doorway
in
the
cellar
mentioned
in
since
it
was
rebuilt
about
the
same
time
as
the
new
church
first
rose
it
is
just
a
big
comfortable
warm
cool
shady
sort
of
house
with
a
large
hall
and
a
fine
oak
staircase
surrounded
by
lawns
and
shrubberies
that
adjoin
on
the
west
the
lower
slopes
first
of
the
park
and
then
of
the
moors
that
stretch
away
over
the
horizon
there
is
a
pleasant
feudal
air
about
the
whole
place
feudal
in
a
small
and
neighborly
kind
of
way
jack
father
died
just
a
year
before
his
only
son
came
of
age
and
jack
himself
surrounded
by
sisters
and
an
excellent
and
mother
has
succeeded
to
all
the
immemorial
rights
and
powers
written
and
unwritten
of
the
squire
of
barham
he
entertained
me
delightfully
for
three
or
four
days
a
few
months
ago
when
i
was
traveling
about
after
frank
footsteps
and
i
noticed
with
pleasure
as
we
drove
through
the
town
that
there
was
hardly
a
living
creature
in
the
town
whom
he
did
not
salute
and
who
did
not
salute
him
he
took
me
first
to
the
bridge
and
pulled
up
in
the
middle
of
it
to
point
out
a
small
recess
in
it
over
the
central
pier
intended
no
doubt
to
give
shelter
to
before
the
bridge
was
widened
in
case
a
large
vehicle
came
through
there
he
said
that
the
place
i
first
saw
frank
when
he
came
we
drove
on
up
through
the
town
and
at
the
foot
of
the
almost
precipitous
hill
leading
up
to
the
ruined
church
we
got
out
leaving
the
in
charge
of
the
groom
we
climbed
the
hill
slowly
for
it
was
a
hot
day
jack
uttering
reminiscences
at
intervals
many
of
which
are
recorded
in
these
pages
and
turned
in
at
the
churchyard
gate
and
this
was
the
place
said
jack
where
i
said
to
him
ii
it
was
on
the
of
september
a
monday
that
jack
sat
in
the
in
norfolk
jacket
and
gaiters
drinking
tea
as
fast
as
he
possibly
could
he
had
been
out
on
the
moors
all
day
and
was
as
thirsty
as
the
moors
could
make
him
and
he
had
been
sensual
enough
to
smoke
a
cigarette
deliberately
before
beginning
tea
in
order
to
bring
his
thirst
to
an
acute
point
then
the
instant
he
had
finished
he
snatched
for
his
case
again
for
this
was
to
be
the
best
cigarette
of
the
whole
day
and
discovered
that
his
sensuality
had
overreached
itself
for
once
and
that
there
were
none
left
he
clutched
at
the
silver
box
with
a
sinking
heart
that
he
had
filled
his
case
with
the
last
of
them
this
morning
it
was
a
fact
and
he
knew
that
there
were
no
others
in
the
house
this
would
never
do
and
he
reflected
that
if
he
sent
a
man
for
some
more
he
would
not
get
them
for
at
least
twenty
minutes
jack
never
could
understand
why
an
footman
always
occupied
twenty
minutes
in
a
journey
that
ought
to
take
eight
so
he
put
on
his
cap
again
stepped
out
of
the
low
window
and
set
off
down
the
drive
it
was
getting
a
little
dark
as
he
passed
out
of
the
the
sun
of
course
had
set
at
least
an
hour
before
behind
the
great
hill
to
the
west
but
the
twilight
proper
was
only
just
beginning
he
was
nearly
at
the
place
now
and
as
he
breasted
the
steep
ascent
of
the
bridge
peered
over
it
at
least
with
his
mind
eye
at
the
shop
first
on
the
left
where
a
store
of
jack
cigarettes
was
always
on
hand
he
noticed
in
the
little
recess
i
have
just
spoken
of
a
man
leaning
with
his
elbows
on
the
parapet
and
staring
out
up
the
long
reach
of
the
stream
to
the
purple
evening
moors
against
the
sky
and
the
luminous
glory
itself
and
as
he
came
opposite
him
wondered
vaguely
who
it
was
and
whether
he
knew
him
then
as
he
got
just
opposite
him
he
stopped
uneasy
at
heart
naturally
frank
was
never
very
far
away
from
jack
thoughts
just
now
ever
since
indeed
he
had
heard
the
news
in
a
very
discreet
letter
from
the
reverend
james
launton
a
week
or
two
ago
i
need
not
say
he
had
answered
this
letter
not
to
the
father
but
to
the
daughter
but
had
received
no
reply
he
had
written
a
frantic
letter
to
frank
himself
then
but
it
had
been
returned
marked
unknown
at
this
address
and
ever
since
he
had
eyed
all
tramps
on
the
road
with
an
earnestness
that
elicited
occasionally
a
salute
and
occasionally
an
impolite
remark
the
figure
whose
back
he
saw
now
certainly
was
not
much
like
frank
but
then
again
it
was
rather
like
him
it
was
dressed
in
a
jacket
and
trousers
so
stained
with
dust
and
wet
as
to
have
no
color
of
their
own
at
all
and
a
cloth
cap
of
the
same
appearance
a
bundle
tied
up
in
a
red
handkerchief
and
a
heavy
stick
rested
propped
against
an
angle
of
the
recess
jack
cleared
his
throat
rather
loud
and
stood
still
prepared
to
be
admiring
the
view
in
case
of
necessity
the
figure
turned
an
eye
over
its
shoulder
then
faced
completely
round
and
it
was
frank
guiseley
jack
for
the
first
instant
said
nothing
at
all
but
stood
transfixed
with
his
mouth
a
little
open
and
his
eyes
staring
frank
face
was
sunburned
almost
beyond
recognition
his
hair
seemed
cut
shorter
than
usual
and
the
light
was
behind
him
then
jack
recovered
my
dear
man
he
said
why
the
he
seized
him
by
the
hands
and
held
him
staring
at
him
yes
it
me
all
right
said
frank
i
was
just
wondering
come
along
instantly
damn
i
got
to
go
to
a
tobacconist
only
just
here
there
is
a
cigarette
in
the
house
come
with
me
i
wait
here
said
frank
will
you
i
sha
be
a
second
it
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
scarcely
one
minute
before
jack
was
back
he
had
darted
in
snatched
a
box
from
the
shelf
and
vanished
crying
out
to
put
it
down
to
him
he
found
frank
had
faced
round
again
and
was
staring
at
the
water
and
sky
and
high
moors
he
snatched
up
his
bundle
and
stick
come
along
he
said
we
shall
have
an
hour
or
two
before
dinner
frank
in
silence
took
the
bundle
and
stick
from
him
again
firmly
and
irresistibly
and
they
did
not
speak
again
till
they
were
out
of
of
the
lodge
then
jack
began
taking
frank
arm
a
custom
for
which
he
had
often
been
rebuked
my
dear
old
man
he
said
i
i
ca
say
what
i
feel
i
know
the
whole
thing
of
course
and
i
expressed
my
mind
plainly
to
miss
jenny
yes
and
to
your
father
neither
have
answered
and
naturally
i
have
been
over
again
dick
been
there
by
the
way
frank
made
no
comment
you
look
simply
awful
old
chap
pursued
jack
cheerily
where
on
earth
have
you
been
for
the
last
month
i
wrote
to
york
and
got
the
letter
returned
oh
i
been
up
and
down
said
frank
impassively
with
the
people
you
were
with
before
the
man
i
mean
no
i
left
them
for
the
present
but
i
shall
probably
join
them
again
later
join
began
the
other
aghast
certainly
this
thing
only
just
begun
said
frank
with
that
same
odd
impassivity
we
seen
the
worst
of
it
i
fancy
but
you
do
mean
you
going
back
why
it
ridiculous
frank
stopped
they
were
within
sight
of
the
house
now
and
the
lights
shone
pleasantly
out
by
the
way
jack
i
quite
forgot
you
will
kindly
give
me
your
promise
to
make
no
sort
of
effort
to
detain
me
when
i
want
to
go
again
or
i
sha
come
any
further
but
my
dear
chap
kindly
promise
at
once
please
oh
well
i
promise
but
that
all
right
said
frank
and
moved
on
i
say
said
jack
as
they
came
up
to
the
hall
door
will
you
talk
now
or
will
you
change
or
what
i
should
like
a
hot
bath
first
by
the
way
have
you
anyone
staying
in
the
house
not
a
soul
and
only
two
sisters
at
home
and
my
mother
of
course
what
about
clothes
i
see
about
that
come
on
round
to
the
window
then
i
get
in
jackson
and
explain
to
him
i
suppose
you
do
mind
your
name
being
known
he
probably
recognize
you
anyhow
not
in
the
least
so
long
as
no
one
interferes
jack
rang
the
bell
as
soon
as
they
came
into
the
and
frank
sat
down
in
a
deep
chair
then
the
butler
came
he
cast
one
long
look
at
the
astonishing
figure
in
the
chair
oh
er
jackson
this
is
frank
guiseley
he
going
to
stay
here
he
want
some
clothes
and
things
i
rather
think
there
are
some
suits
of
mine
that
might
do
i
wish
you
look
them
out
i
beg
your

jackson
said
frank
gravely
from
the
chair
i
shall
want
them
again
yes
sir
that
all
then
said
jack
jackson
turned
stiffly
and
left
the
room
it
all
right
said
jack
you
remember
old
jackson
he
wo
say
a
word
lucky
no
one
saw
us
as
we
came
up
it
does
matter
much
does
it
said
frank
there
was
a
pause
i
say
frank
when
will
you
tell
me
i
answer
any
questions
after
dinner
i
simply
ca
talk
now
dinner
was
a
little
difficult
that
night
kirkby
had
been
subjected
to
a
long
lecture
from
her
son
during
the
half
hour
in
which
she
ought
to
have
been
dressing
in
order
to
have
it
firmly
implanted
in
her
mind
that
frank
whom
she
had
known
from
a
boy
was
simply
and
solely
in
the
middle
of
a
all
by
himself
she
understood
the
situation
perfectly
in
a
minute
and
a
half
she
was
a
very
shrewd
woman
who
did
not
say
much
but
jack
was
not
content
he
hovered
about
her
room
fingering
photographs
and
brushes
explaining
over
and
over
again
how
important
it
was
that
frank
should
be
made
to
feel
at
his
case
and
that
fanny
and
jill
who
were
just
old
enough
to
come
to
dinner
in
white
frocks
that
came
down
to
their
very
slender
ankles
and
thick
down
their
backs
must
not
be
allowed
to
bother
him
kirkby
said
yes
i
understand
about
a
hundred
and
thirty
times
and
glanced
at
the
clock
she
stood
with
one
finger
on
the
electric
button
for
at
least
five
minutes
before
venturing
to
ring
for
her
maid
and
it
was
only
that
lady
discreet
tap
at
one
minute
before
eight
that
finally
got
jack
out
of
the
room
he
looked
in
on
frank
in
the
middle
of
his
dressing
found
to
his
relief
that
an
oldish
suit
of
fitted
him
quite
decently
and
then
went
to
put
on
his
own
he
came
down
to
the
seven
minutes
after
the
gong
with
his
ears
very
red
and
his
hair
in
a
plume
to
find
frank
talking
to
his
mother
and
eyed
by
his
sisters
who
were
pretending
to
look
at
photographs
with
all
the
ease
in
the
world
but
dinner
itself
was
difficult
it
was
the
obvious
thing
to
talk
about
frank
and
yet
this
was
exactly
what
jack
dared
not
do
the
state
of
the
moors
and
the
deplorable
ravages
made
among
the
young
grouse
by
the
early
rains
occupied
them
all
to
the
end
of
fish
to
the
grouse
succeeded
the
bullocks
to
the
bullocks
the
sheep
and
by
an
obvious
connection
obvious
to
all
who
knew
that
gentleman
from
the
sheep
to
the
new
curate
but
just
before
the
chocolate
there
came
a
pause
and
jill
the
younger
of
the
two
sisters
hastened
to
fill
the
gap
did
you
have
a
nice
mr
guiseley
frank
turned
to
her
politely
yes
very
nice
considering
he
said
have
you
been
alone
all
the
time
pursued
jill
conscious
of
a
social
success
well
no
said
frank
i
was
traveling
with
a
well
with
a
man
who
was
an
officer
in
the
army
he
was
a
major
and
did
you
that
enough
jill
said
her
mother
decidedly
do
bother
guiseley
he
tired
with
his
walk
the
two
young
men
sat
quiet
for
a
minute
or
two
after
the
ladies
had
left
the
room
then
jack
spoke
well
he
said
frank
looked
up
there
was
an
odd
patient
kind
of
look
in
his
eyes
that
touched
jack
a
good
deal
frank
had
not
been
distinguished
for
submissiveness
hitherto
oh
a
bit
later
if
you
do
mind
he
said
we
can
talk
in
the
iv
well
i
tell
you
the
whole
thing
as
far
as
i
understand
it
began
frank
as
the
door
closed
behind
jackson
who
had
brought
whisky
and
candles
and
then
i
answer
any
questions
you
want
he
settled
himself
back
in
his
chair
stretching
out
his
legs
and
clasping
his
hands
behind
his
head
jack
had
a
good
view
of
him
and
could
take
notice
of
his
own
impressions
though
he
found
them
hard
to
put
into
words
afterwards
the
words
he
finally
chose
were
subdued
and
patient
again
and
there
are
hardly
two
words
that
would
have
been
less
applicable
to
frank
three
months
before
at
the
same
time
his
virility
was
more
noticeable
than
ever
he
had
about
him
jack
said
something
of
the
air
of
a
very
good
groom
a
and
sharp
yet
not
at
all
unkindly
look
very
capable
and
at
the
same
time
very
much
restrained
there
was
no
sentimental
nonsense
about
him
at
all
his
sorrow
had
not
taken
that
form
well
i
need
talk
much
about
jenny
last
letter
and
what
happened
after
that
i
was
entirely
unprepared
of
course
i
had
the
faintest
idea
well
she
was
the
one
person
about
whom
i
had
no
doubts
at
all
i
actually
left
the
letter
unread
for
a
few
minutes
the
envelope
was
in
your
handwriting
you
know
because
i
had
to
think
over
what
i
had
to
do
next
the
police
had
got
me
turned
away
from
a
builder
yard
jack
emitted
a
small
sound
he
was
staring
at
frank
with
all
his
eyes
yes
that
their
way
said
frank
well
when
i
read
it
i
simply
could
think
any
more
at
all
for
a
time
the
girl
we
were
traveling
with
she
had
picked
up
with
the
man
i
had
got
into
trouble
over
you
know
the
girl
was
calling
me
to
dinner
she
told
me
afterwards
i
did
hear
a
sound
she
came
and
touched
me
at
last
and
i
woke
up
but
i
could
say
anything
they
do
even
now
know
what
the
matter
i
came
away
that
afternoon
i
could
even
wait
for
the
major
eh
the
major
oh
that
what
the
chap
calls
himself
i
do
think
he
lying
either
i
simply
could
stand
him
another
minute
just
then
but
i
sent
them
a
postcard
that
night
i
forget
where
from
and
there
are
any
letters
for
me
are
there
one
or
two
bills
oh
well
i
shall
hear
soon
i
expect
i
must
join
them
again
in
a
day
or
two
they
somewhere
in
this
direction
i
know
and
what
did
you
do
frank
considered
i
not
quite
sure
i
know
i
walked
a
great
deal
people
were
awfully
good
to
me
one
woman
stopped
her
motor
and
i
had
begged
either
you
begged
lord
yes
lots
of
times
well
she
gave
me
a
quid
and
i
even
thank
her
and
that
lasted
me
very
well
and
i
did
a
little
work
too
here
and
there
but
good
lord
what
did
you
do
i
walked
i
could
bear
towns
or
people
or
anything
i
got
somewhere
outside
of
ripon
at
last
and
went
out
on
to
the
moors
i
found
an
old
shepherd
hut
for
about
a
week
or
ten
days
and
you
lived
there
yes
i
mended
the
hut
thoroughly
before
i
came
away
and
then
i
thought
i
come
on
here
what
were
you
doing
on
the
bridge
waiting
till
dark
i
was
going
to
ask
at
the
lodge
then
whether
you
were
at
home
and
if
i
had
been
gone
on
somewhere
else
i
suppose
jack
tried
to
help
himself
to
a
whisky
and
soda
but
the
soda
flew
out
all
over
his
like
a
fountain
and
he
was
forced
to
make
a
small
remark
then
he
made
another
what
about
prison
frank
smiled
oh
i
almost
forgotten
that
it
was
beastly
at
the
time
though
and
and
the
major
and
the
work
lord
frank
you
do
tell
a
story
badly
he
smiled
again
much
more
completely
i
too
busy
inside
he
said
those
things
do
seem
to
matter
much
somehow
inside
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
frank
made
a
tiny
deprecating
gesture
well
what
it
all
about
you
know
jack
yes
it
a
frightfully
priggish
thing
to
say
but
i
extraordinarily
interested
as
to
what
going
to
happen
next
inside
i
mean
at
least
sometimes
and
then
at
other
times
i
do
care
a
hang
jack
looked
bewildered
and
said
so
tersely
frank
leaned
forward
a
little
it
like
this
you
see
something
or
other
has
taken
me
in
hand
blessed
if
i
know
what
all
these
things
do
happen
one
on
the
top
of
the
other
just
by
a
fluke
there
something
going
on
and
i
want
to
know
what
it
is
and
i
suppose
something
going
to
happen
soon
for
god
sake
do
say
what
you
mean
i
ca
more
than
that
i
tell
you
i
do
know
i
only
wish
somebody
could
tell
me
but
what
does
it
all
amount
to
what
are
you
going
to
do
next
oh
i
know
that
all
right
i
going
to
join
the
major
and
gertie
again
frank
yes
no
not
a
word
please
you
promised
you
would
i
going
to
join
those
two
again
and
see
what
happens
but
why
that
my
job
i
know
that
much
i
got
to
get
that
girl
back
to
her
people
again
she
not
his
wife
you
know
but
what
the
devil
it
seems
to
me
to
matter
a
good
deal
oh
she
a
thoroughly
stupid
girl
and
he
a
proper
cad
but
that
does
matter
it
got
to
be
done
or
rather
i
got
to
try
to
do
it
i
daresay
i
sha
succeed
but
that
again
does
matter
i
got
to
do
my
job
and
then
see
jack
threw
up
his
hands
you
cracked
he
said
i
daresay
said
frank
solemnly
there
was
a
pause
it
seemed
to
jack
that
the
whole
thing
must
be
a
dream
this
simply
was
frank
at
all
the
wild
idea
came
to
him
that
the
man
who
sat
before
him
with
frank
features
was
some
kind
of
changeling
mentally
he
shook
himself
and
what
about
jenny
he
said
frank
sat
perfectly
silent
and
still
for
an
instant
then
he
spoke
without
heat
i
not
quite
sure
he
said
sometimes
i
like
to
well
to
make
her
a
little
speech
about
what
she
done
and
sometimes
i
like
to
crawl
to
her
and
kiss
her
feet
but
both
those
things
are
when
feeling
bad
on
the
whole
i
think
though
i
not
sure
that
is
not
my
business
any
more
in
fact
i
pretty
sure
it
not
it
part
of
the
whole
campaign
and
out
of
my
hands
it
no
good
talking
about
that
any
more
so
please
do
jack
one
question
well
have
you
written
to
her
or
sent
her
a
message
no
and
i
want
to
say
one
other
thing
i
do
think
it
against
the
bargain
well
will
you
take
five
hundred
pounds
and
go
out
to
the
colonies
frank
looked
up
with
an
amused
smile
no
i
wo
thanks
very
much
am
i
in
such
disgrace
as
all
that
then
you
know
i
do
mean
that
said
jack
quietly
no
old
chap
i
ought
to
have
said
that
i
sorry
jack
waved
a
hand
i
thought
perhaps
you
loathe
england
and
would
like
and
you
seem
absolutely
bursting
with
pride
you
know
honestly
i
do
think
i
am
said
frank
but
england
suits
me
very
well
and
there
are
the
other
two
you
know
but
i
tell
you
one
thing
you
could
do
for
me
yes
pay
those
extra
bills
i
do
think
they
much
that
all
right
said
jack
and
you
really
mean
to
go
on
with
it
all
why
yes
v
the
moors
had
been
pretty
well
shot
over
already
since
the
twelfth
of
august
but
the
two
had
a
very
pleasant
day
for
all
that
a
couple
of
days
later
they
went
but
with
a
keeper
and
half
a
dozen
beaters
frank
in
an
old
homespun
suit
of
jack
and
his
own
powerful
boots
and
made
a
very
tolerable
bag
there
was
one
dramatic
moment
jack
told
me
when
they
found
that
luncheon
had
been
laid
at
a
high
point
on
the
hills
from
which
the
great
gray
mass
of
merefield
and
the
shimmer
of
the
lake
in
front
of
the
house
were
plainly
visible
only
eight
miles
away
the
flag
was
flying
too
from
the
flagstaff
on
the
old
keep
showing
according
to
ancient
custom
that
lord
talgarth
was
at
home
frank
looked
at
it
a
minute
or
two
with
genial
interest
and
jack
wondered
whether
he
had
noticed
as
he
himself
had
that
even
the
rectory
roof
could
be
made
out
just
by
the
church
tower
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
neither
said
anything
but
as
the
keeper
came
up
to
ask
for
orders
as
they
finished
lunch
he
tactfully
observed
that
there
was
a
wonderful
fine
view
of
merefield
yes
said
frank
you
could
almost
make
out
people
with
a
telescope
the
two
were
walking
together
alone
as
they
dropped
down
an
hour
before
sunset
on
to
the
upper
end
of
barham
they
were
both
glowing
with
the
splendid
air
and
exercise
and
were
just
in
that
state
of
weariness
that
is
almost
unmixed
physical
pleasure
to
an
imaginative
thinker
who
contemplates
a
hot
bath
a
quantity
of
tea
and
a
long
evening
in
a
deep
chair
frank
still
preserved
his
impassive
kind
of
attitude
towards
things
in
general
but
jack
noticed
with
gentle
delight
that
he
seemed
more
off
his
guard
and
that
he
even
walked
with
something
more
of
an
alert
swing
than
he
had
on
that
first
evening
when
they
trudged
up
the
drive
together
their
road
led
them
past
the
gate
of
the
old
churchyard
and
as
they
approached
it
dropping
their
feet
faster
and
faster
down
the
steep
slope
jack
noticed
two
figures
sitting
on
the
with
their
feet
in
the
ditch
a
man
and
a
girl
he
was
going
past
them
just
observing
that
the
man
had
rather
an
unpleasant
face
with
a
ragged
mustache
and
that
the
girl
was
sunburned
and
rather
pretty
when
he
became
aware
that
frank
had
slipped
behind
him
the
next
instant
he
saw
that
frank
was
speaking
to
them
and
his
heart
dropped
to
zero
all
right
he
heard
frank
say
i
was
expecting
you
this
evening
then
i
say
jack
jack
turned
jack
this
is
major
and
trustcott
i
told
you
of
this
is
my
friend
er
mr
jack
jack
bowed
vaguely
overwhelmed
with
disgust
very
happy
to
make
your
acquaintance
sir
said
the
major
straightening
himself
in
a
military
manner
my
good
lady
and
i
were
resting
here
very
pleasant
neighborhood
i
glad
you
like
it
said
jack
then
this
evening
said
frank
again
can
you
wait
an
hour
or
two
certainly
my
boy
said
the
major
time
no
consideration
with
us
as
you
know
jack
perceived
that
this
was
being
said
at
him
to
show
the
familiarity
this
man
enjoyed
with
his
friend
would
nine
be
too
late
nine
it
shall
be
said
the
major
and
here
here
so
long
then
said
frank
oh
by
the
way
he
moved
a
little
closer
to
this
appalling
pair
and
jack
stood
off
to
hear
the
sound
of
a
sentence
or
two
and
then
the
chink
of
money
so
long
then
said
frank
again
come
along
jack
we
must
make
haste
sir
cried
the
major
but
jack
made
no
answer
frank
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
those
are
the
people
that
the
major
and
gertie
yes
and
what
was
all
that
about
this
evening
i
must
go
jack
i
sorry
but
i
told
you
it
could
be
more
than
a
few
days
at
the
outside
jack
was
silent
but
it
was
a
hard
struggle
by
the
way
how
shall
we
arrange
went

old
man

stuffy
how
would
it
do
if
i
took

bag
and

that
churchyard

dark

key

suppose
yes
well
then
that
it
and
i

bag

the
key
in
the
hedge
somewhere
jack
was
silent
jack
held
himself
loyally
in
hand
that
evening
but
he
could
not
talk
much
he
consented
to
explain
to
his
mother
that
frank
had
to
be
off
after
dinner
that
night
and
he
also
visited
the
housekeeper
room
and
caused
a
small
bundle
not
much
larger
than
a
leg
of
mutton
including
two
small
bottles
which
jingled
together
to
be
wrapped
up
in
brown
paper
in
which
he
inserted
also
a
note
he
knew
frank
would
not
take
more
and
the
whole
placed
in
the
bag
in
which
frank
old
clothes
were
already
concealed
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
he
sat
mostly
silent
in
one
chair
trying
not
to
watch
frank
in
another
pretending
to
read
but
endeavoring
to
picture
to
his
imagination
what
he
himself
would
feel
like
if
he
were
about
to
join
the
major
and
gertie
in
the
churchyard
at
nine
frank
sat
quite
quiet
all
the
evening
reading
old
volumes
of
they
dined
at
seven
by
request
frank
still
in
his
homespun
suit
fanny
and
jill
were
rather
difficult
it
seemed
to
them
both
a
most
romantic
thing
that
this
sunburned
young
man
with
whom
they
had
played
the
day
before
should
really
be
continuing
his
amazing
in
company
with
two
friends
at
nine
that
very
night
they
wondered
innocently
why
the
two
friends
had
not
been
asked
to
join
them
at
dinner
it
was
exciting
too
and
unusual
that
this
young
man
should
dine
in
an
old
homespun
suit
they
asked
a
quantity
of
questions
where
was
guiseley
going
first
frank
quite
know
where
would
he
sleep
that
night
frank
did
quite
know
he
would
have
to
see
when
was
the
going
to
end
frank
quite
know
did
he
really
like
it
oh
well
frank
thought
it
was
a
good
thing
to
go
on
a
walking
tour
even
if
you
were
rather
uncomfortable
sometimes
the
was
unemotional
jack
had
announced
suddenly
and
loudly
in
the
before
dinner
that
he
was
going
to
see
the
last
of
frank
as
far
as
the
churchyard
frank
had
protested
but
had
yielded
the
rest
had
all
said
to
him
in
the
hall
and
at
a
quarter
to
nine
the
two
young
men
went
out
into
the
darkness
vi
it
was
a
clear
autumn
night
a
wonderful
night
of
stars
and
the
skies
blazed
softly
overhead
down
to
the
great
blotted
masses
of
the
high
moors
that
stood
round
barham
it
was
perfectly
still
too
the
wind
had
dropped
and
the
only
sound
as
the
two
walked
down
the
park
was
the
low
talking
of
the
stream
over
the
stones
beyond
the
belt
of
trees
fifty
yards
away
from
the
road
jack
was
sick
at
heart
but
even
so
he
tells
me
he
was
conscious
that
frank
silence
was
of
a
peculiar
sort
he
felt
somehow
as
if
his
friend
were
setting
out
to
some
great
sacrifice
in
which
he
was
to
suffer
and
was
only
partly
conscious
of
it
or
at
least
so
buoyed
by
some
kind
of
exaltation
or
fanaticism
as
not
to
realize
what
he
was
doing
he
reminded
me
of
a
certain
kind
of
dream
that
most
people
have
now
and
then
of
accompanying
some
friend
to
death
the
friend
goes
forward
silent
and
exultant
and
we
can
not
explain
nor
hold
him
back
that
was
the
sort
of
feeling
said
jack
lamely
jack
had
the
grim
satisfaction
of
carrying
the
bag
in
which
so
to
speak
the
knife
and
fillet
were
hidden
he
changed
his
mood
half
a
dozen
times
even
in
that
quarter
of
an
hour
walk
through
the
town
now
the
thing
seemed
horrible
like
a
nightmare
now
absurdly
preposterous
now
rather
beautiful
now
perfectly
ordinary
and
commonplace
after
all
jack
argued
with
himself
there
are
such
people
as
tramps
and
they
survive
why
should
not
frank
he
had
gipsy
blood
in
him
too
what
in
the
world
was
he
jack
frightened
of
do
you
remember
our
talking
about
your
grandmother
he
said
suddenly
as
they
neared
the
lodge
yes
why
only
i
just
thought
of
something
else
was
one
of
your
people
executed
under
elizabeth
by
gad
yes
so
he
was
i
quite
forgotten
it
was
being
on
the
wrong
side
for
once
how
the
wrong
side
there
was
amusement
in
frank
voice
as
he
answered
it
was
for
religion
he
said
he
was
a
papist
all
the
rest
of
them
conformed
promptly
they
were
a
most
accommodating
lot
they
changed
each
time
without
making
any
difficulty
i
remember
my
governor
telling
us
about
it
once
he
thought
them
very
sensible
and
so
they
were
by
george
from
one
point
of
view
has
your
religion
anything
to
do
with
all
this
oh
i
suppose
so
said
frank
with
an
indifferent
air
there
were
a
good
many
doors
open
in
the
high
street
as
they
went
up
it
and
jack
saluted
half
a
dozen
people
mechanically
as
they
touched
their
hats
to
him
as
he
passed
in
the
light
from
the
houses
what
does
it
feel
like
being
squire
asked
frank
oh
i
do
know
said
jack
rather
good
fun
i
should
think
said
frank
they
were
nearing
the
steep
part
of
the
ascent
presently
and
the
church
clock
struck
nine
bit
late
said
frank
when
will
you
come
again
asked
the
other
suddenly
i
here
another
fortnight
you
know
and
then
at
christmas
again
come
for
christmas
if
you
can
ah
i
do
know
where
i
shall
be
give
my
love
to
cambridge
though
frank
yes
may
i
say
what
i
think
no
ah
there
was
the
roof
of
the
old
church
standing
out
against
the
stars
and
there
could
be
no
more
talking
they
might
come
upon
the
other
two
at
any
moment
now
they
went
five
steps
further
and
there
in
the
shadow
of
the
gate
burned
a
dull
red
spot
of
fire
that
kindled
up
as
they
looked
and
showed
for
an
instant
the
heavy
eyes
of
the
major
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
sir
came
the
military
voice
and
the
girl
rose
to
her
feet
beside
him
you
just
in
time
said
jack
dully
we
had
a
pleasant
evening
of
it
up
here
kirkby
after
stepped
down
and
had
a
bit
of
supper
at
the
i
suppose
you
heard
my
name
there
said
jack
quite
right
sir
give
us
the
key
said
frank
abruptly
he
unlocked
the
door
and
pushed
it
back
over
the
gravel
wait
for
me
here
will
you
he
said
to
jack
i
coming
in
i
show
you
where
to
change
twenty
yards
of
an
irregular
twisted
path
over
which
they
stumbled
two
or
three
times
led
them
down
to
the
little
ruined
doorway
at
the
west
end
of
the
old
church
jack
father
had
restored
the
place
admirably
so
far
as
restoration
was
possible
and
there
stood
now
strong
as
ever
the
old
tower
roofed
and
floored
throughout
abutting
on
the
four
roofless
walls
within
which
ran
the
double
row
of
column
bases
jack
struck
a
light
kindled
a
bicycle
lamp
he
had
brought
with
him
and
led
the
way
come
in
here
he
said
frank
followed
him
into
the
room
at
the
base
of
the
tower
and
looked
round
this
looks
all
right
he
said
it
was
a
catholic
church
once
i
suppose
yes
the
parson
says
this
was
the
old
sacristy
they
found
things
here
i
think
cupboards
in
the
wall
and
so
on
this
do
excellently
said
frank
i
sha
be
five
minutes
jack
went
out
again
without
a
word
he
felt
it
was
a
little
too
much
to
expect
him
to
see
the
change
actually
being
made
and
the
garments
of
sacrifice
put
on
it
struck
him
with
an
unpleasant
shock
considering
the
form
of
his
previous
metaphor
that
he
should
have
taken
frank
into
the
old
sacristy
he
sat
down
on
the
low
wall
built
to
hold
the
churchyard
from
slipping
altogether
down
the
and
looked
out
over
the
little
town
below
the
sky
was
more
noticeable
here
one
was
more
conscious
of
the
enormous
silent
vault
crowded
with
the
steady
stars
cool
and
aloof
and
beneath
of
the
feverish
little
town
with
sparks
of
red
light
dotted
here
and
there
where
men
wrangled
and
planned
and
bargained
and
carried
on
the
little
affairs
of
their
little
life
with
such
astonishing
zest
jack
was
far
from
philosophical
as
a
rule
but
it
is
a
fact
that
meditations
of
this
nature
did
engross
him
for
a
minute
or
two
while
he
sat
and
waited
for
frank
and
heard
the
low
voices
talking
in
the
lane
outside
it
even
occurred
to
him
for
an
instant
that
it
was
just
possible
that
what
frank
had
said
in
the
before
dinner
was
true
and
that
something
really
did
have
him
in
hand
and
really
did
intend
a
definite
plan
and
result
to
emerge
from
this
deplorable
and
quixotic
nonsense
i
suppose
the
contrast
of
stars
and
human
lights
may
have
helped
to
suggest
this
sort
of
thing
to
him
then
he
gave
himself
up
again
to
dismal
considerations
of
a
more
particular
kind
he
heard
frank
come
out
and
turned
to
see
him
in
the
dim
light
bag
in
hand
dressed
again
as
he
had
been
three
days
ago
on
his
head
once
more
was
the
indescribable
cap
on
his
body
the
indescribable
clothes
he
wore
on
his
feet
the
boots
in
which
he
had
tramped
the
moors
that
day
how
far
away
seemed
that
afternoon
now
and
the
cheerful
lunch
in
the
sunshine
on
the
here
i
am
jack
then
every
promise
went
to
the
winds
jack
stood
up
and
took
a
step
towards
him
frank
i
do
implore
you
to
give
up
this
folly
i
asked
you
not
to
do
it
at
cambridge
and
i
ask
you
again
now
i
do
care
a
damn
what
i
promised
it
simple
madness
and
frank
had
wheeled
without
a
word
and
was
to
the
gate
jack
stumbled
after
him
calling
under
his
breath
but
the
other
had
already
passed
through
the
gate
and
joined
the
major
and
gertie
before
jack
could
reach
him
and
so
you
think
up
here
is
the
right
direction
frank
was
saying
i
got
some
tips
at
the
said
the
major
there
are
some
farms
up
there
where
frank
may
i
speak
to
you
a
minute
no
all
right
major
i
ready
at
once
if
you
are
he
turned
towards
jack
by
the
way
he
said
what
in
this
parcel
something
to
eat
and
drink
murmured
jack
oh
i
sha
want
that
thanks
very
much
here
the
bag
with
the
clothes
in
it
i
awfully
grateful
old
man
for
all
your
kindness
awfully
sorry
to
have
bothered
you
by
the
way
frankie
put
in
the
hateful
voice
at
his
side
i
take
charge
of
that
parcel
if
you
do
want
it
catch
hold
then
said
frank
you
welcome
to
it
if
you
carry
it
you
all
right
gertie
the
girl
murmured
something
inaudible
as
at
their
first
meeting
she
had
said
nothing
at
all
the
major
lifted
a
bundle
out
of
the
depths
of
the
hedge
slung
it
on
his
stick
and
stood
waiting
his
face
again
illuminated
with
the
glow
of
his
pipe
he
had
handed
the
new
parcel
to
gertie
without
a
word
well
again
old
man
said
frank
holding
out
his
hand
he
too
jack
saw
had
his
small
bundle
wrapped
up
in
the
red
handkerchief
as
on
the
bridge
when
they
had
first
met
jack
took
his
hand
and
shook
it
he
could
say
nothing
then
the
three
turned
and
set
their
faces
up
the
slope
he
could
see
them
all
silent
together
pass
up
more
and
more
dim
in
the
darkness
of
the
hedge
the
two
men
walking
together
the
girl
a
yard
behind
them
then
they
turned
the
corner
and
were
gone
but
jack
still
stood
where
frank
had
left
him
listening
until
long
after
the
sound
of
their
footfalls
had
died
away
vii
jack
had
a
horrid
dream
that
night
he
was
wandering
he
thought
gun
in
hand
after
grouse
alone
on
the
high
moors
it
was
one
of
those
heavy
days
so
common
in
dreams
when
the
light
is
so
dim
that
very
little
can
be
seen
he
was
aware
of
countless
round
him
and
valleys
that
ran
down
into
profound
darkness
where
only
the
lights
of
houses
could
be
discerned
his
sport
was
of
that
kind
peculiar
to
enormous
birds
larger
than
ostriches
rose
occasionally
by
ones
or
twos
with
incredible
swiftness
and
soared
like
balloons
against
the
heavy
glimmering
sky
he
fired
at
these
and
feathers
sprang
from
them
but
not
a
bird
fell
once
he
inflicted
an
indescribable
wound
and
the
bird
sped
across
the
sky
blotting
out
half
of
it
screaming
then
as
the
screaming
died
he
became
aware
that
there
was
a
human
note
in
it
and
that
frank
was
crying
to
him
somewhere
across
the
confines
of
the
wold
and
the
horror
that
had
been
deepening
with
each
shot
he
fired
rose
to
an
intolerable
climax
then
began
one
of
the
regular
nightmare
chases
he
set
off
to
run
the
screaming
grew
fainter
each
instant
he
could
not
see
his
way
in
the
gloom
he
clambered
over
bowlders
he
sank
in
bogs
and
dragged
his
feet
from
them
with
infinite
pains
his
gun
became
an
unbearable
burden
yet
he
dared
not
throw
it
from
him
he
knew
that
he
should
need
it
presently
the
screaming
had
ceased
now
yet
he
dared
not
stop
running
frank
was
in
some
urgent
peril
and
he
knew
it
was
not
yet
too
late
if
he
could
but
find
him
soon
he
ran
and
ran
the
ground
was
now
in
the
feathers
that
had
fallen
from
the
wounded
birds
it
was
darker
than
ever
yet
he
toiled
on
hopelessly
following
as
he
thought
the
direction
from
which
the
cries
had
come
then
as
at
last
he
topped
the
rise
of
a
hill
the
screaming
broke
out
again
shrill
and
frightful
close
at
hand
and
the
next
instant
he
saw
beneath
him
in
the
valley
a
hundred
yards
away
that
for
which
he
had
run
so
far
running
up
the
slope
below
at
right
angles
to
his
own
path
came
frank
in
the
he
had
borrowed
with
pumps
upon
his
feet
his
hands
were
outstretched
his
face
white
as
ashes
and
he
screamed
as
he
ran
behind
him
ran
a
pack
of
persons
whose
faces
he
could
not
see
they
ran
like
hounds
murmuring
as
they
came
in
a
terrible
whining
voice
then
jack
understood
that
he
could
save
frank
he
brought
his
gun
to
the
shoulder
aimed
it
at
the
brown
of
the
pack
and
drew
the
trigger
a
snap
followed
and
he
discovered
that
he
was
unloaded
he
groped
in
his
and
found
it
empty
he
tore
at
his
pockets
and
found
at
last
one
cartridge
and
as
he
dashed
it
into
the
open
breach
his
gun
broke
in
half
simultaneously
the
quarry
vanished
over
an
edge
of
hill
and
the
pack
followed
the
leaders
now
not
ten
yards
behind
the
flying
figure
in
front
jack
stood
there
helpless
and
maddened
then
he
flung
the
broken
pieces
of
his
gun
at
the
disappearing
runners
sank
down
in
the
gloom
and
broke
out
into
that
nightmare
sobbing
which
shows
that
the
limit
has
been
reached
he
awoke
still
sobbing
certain
that
frank
was
in
deadly
peril
if
not
already
dead
and
it
was
a
few
minutes
before
he
dared
to
go
to
sleep
once
more
chapter
ii
i
the
rectory
garden
at
merefield
was
obviously
this
summer
the
proper
place
to
spend
most
of
the
day
certainly
the
house
was
cool
it
was
one
of
those
long
low
places
that
somehow
suggest
william
iv
and
crinolines
if
it
is
a
fact
that
those
two
institutions
flourished
together
as
i
think
with
large
darkish
rooms
and
wide
low
staircases
and
windows
through
which
roses
peep
but
the
shadow
of
the
limes
and
the
yews
was
cooler
still
a
table
stood
almost
permanently
through
those
long
hot
summer
days
in
the
place
where
dick
had
sat
with
jenny
and
here
the
rector
and
his
daughter
breakfasted
lunched
and
dined
day
after
day
for
a
really
extraordinarily
long
period
jenny
herself
lived
in
the
garden
even
more
than
her
father
she
got
through
the
household
business
as
quickly
as
possible
after
breakfast
and
came
out
to
do
any
small
businesses
that
she
could
during
the
rest
of
the
morning
she
wrote
a
few
letters
read
a
few
books
sewed
a
little
and
on
the
whole
presented
a
very
domestic
and
amiable
picture
she
visited
poor
people
for
an
hour
or
so
two
or
three
days
a
week
and
occasionally
when
lord
talgarth
was
well
enough
rode
out
with
him
and
her
father
after
tea
through
the
woods
and
sometimes
with
lord
talgarth
alone
she
suffered
practically
no
pangs
of
conscience
at
all
on
the
subject
of
frank
her
letter
had
been
perfectly
sincere
and
she
believed
herself
to
have
been
exceedingly
sensible
it
is
perhaps
one
may
observe
one
of
the
most
dangerous
things
in
the
world
to
think
oneself
sensible
it
is
even
more
dangerous
than
to
be
told
so
for
the
worst
of
it
all
was
that
she
was
quite
right
it
was
quite
plain
that
she
and
frank
were
not
suited
to
one
another
that
she
had
looked
upon
that
particular
quality
in
him
which
burst
out
in
the
incident
the
leaving
of
cambridge
the
going
to
prison
and
so
forth
as
accidental
to
his
character
whereas
it
was
essential
it
was
also
quite
certain
that
it
was
the
apotheosis
of
for
her
to
recognize
that
to
say
so
and
to
break
off
the
engagement
of
course
she
had
moments
of
what
i
should
call
grace
and
she
would
call
insanity
when
she
wondered
for
a
little
while
whether
to
be
sensible
was
the
highest
thing
in
life
but
her
general
attitude
to
these
was
as
it
would
be
towards
temptation
of
any
other
kind
to
be
sensible
she
would
say
was
to
be
successful
and
effective
to
be
otherwise
was
to
fail
and
to
be
ineffective
very
well
then
at
the
beginning
of
september
dick
guiseley
came
to
merefield
to
shoot
grouse
the
grouse
as
i
think
i
have
already
remarked
were
backward
this
year
and
after
a
kind
of
ceremonial
opening
to
give
warning
as
it
were
on
the
twelfth
of
august
they
were
left
in
peace
business
was
to
begin
on
the
third
and
on
the
evening
of
the
second
dick
arrived
he
opened
upon
the
subject
that
chiefly
occupied
his
thoughts
just
now
with
archie
that
night
when
lord
talgarth
had
gone
to
bed
they
were
sitting
in
the
with
the
outer
door
well
open
to
admit
the
warm
evening
air
they
had
discussed
the
prospects
of
grouse
next
day
with
all
proper
solemnity
and
archie
had
enumerated
the
people
who
were
to
form
their
party
the
rector
was
coming
to
shoot
and
jenny
was
to
ride
out
and
join
them
at
lunch
then
archie
yawned
largely
finished
his
drink
and
took
up
his
candle
oh
she
coming
is
she
said
dick
meditatively
archie
struck
a
match
how
frank
went
on
dick
have
heard
from
him
where
is
the
poor
devil
have
an
idea
dick
emitted
a
monosyllabic
laugh
and
how
she
behaving
jenny
oh
just
as
usual
she
a
sensible
girl
and
knows
her
mind
dick
pondered
this
an
instant
i
going
to
bed
said
archie
got
to
have
a
straight
eye
oh
sit
down
a
second
i
want
to
talk
archie
as
a
compromise
propped
himself
against
the
back
of
a
chair
she
does
regret
it
then
pursued
dick
not
she
said
archie
it
would
never
have
done
i
know
agreed
dick
warmly
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
him
that
head
and
heart
went
together
in
this
matter
but
sometimes
you
know
women
regret
that
sort
of
thing
wish
they
had
been
quite
so
sensible
you
know
jenny
does
said
archie
dick
took
up
his
glass
which
he
had
filled
with
his
third
hardly
five
minutes
before
and
drank
half
of
it
he
sucked
his
mustache
and
in
that
instant
confidentialism
rose
in
his
heart
well
i
going
to
have
a
shot
myself
he
said
what
i
going
to
have
a
shot
she
can
but
say
archie
extreme
repose
of
manner
vanished
for
a
second
his
jaw
dropped
a
little
but
good
lord
i
had
the
faintest
i
know
you
had
but
i
had
it
for
a
long
time
what
think
archie
my
good
chap
yes
i
know
leave
all
that
out
we
take
that
as
read
what
comes
next
archie
looked
at
him
a
moment
how
mean
do
you
mean
do
i
approve
well
i
did
mean
that
admitted
dick
i
meant
how
i
better
set
about
it
archie
face
froze
ever
so
slightly
it
will
be
remembered
that
jack
kirkby
considered
him
pompous
you
must
do
it
your
own
way
he
said
sorry
old
man
said
dick
did
mean
to
be
rude
archie
straightened
himself
from
the
it
all
rather
surprising
he
said
it
never
entered
my
head
i
must
think
about
it
put
the
lights
out
when
you
come
archie
old
man
are
you
annoyed
no
no
that
all
right
said
archie
and
really
and
truly
that
was
all
that
passed
between
these
two
that
night
on
the
subject
of
jenny
so
reposeful
were
they
ii
there
was
a
glorious
breeze
blowing
over
the
hills
as
jenny
rode
slowly
up
about
noon
next
day
the
country
is
a
curious
mixture
miles
of
moor
as
desolate
and
simple
and
beautiful
as
moors
can
be
and
by
glimpses
now
and
then
in
the
valleys
between
of
entirely
civilized
villages
with
even
a
town
or
two
here
and
there
spires
and
roofs
and
even
more
ominous
in
this
direction
and
that
lie
patches
of
smoke
about
the
great
chimneys
jenny
was
meditative
as
she
rode
up
alone
it
is
very
difficult
to
be
otherwise
when
one
has
passed
through
one
considerable
crisis
and
foresees
a
number
of
others
that
must
be
met
especially
if
one
has
not
made
up
one
mind
as
to
the
proper
line
of
action
it
is
all
very
well
to
be
sensible
but
a
difficulty
occasionally
arises
as
to
which
of
two
or
three
courses
is
the
more
in
accordance
with
that
character
to
be
impulsive
certainly
leads
to
trouble
sometimes
but
also
sometimes
it
saves
it
jenny
looked
charming
in
repose
she
was
in
a
delightful
green
habit
she
wore
a
plumy
kind
of
hat
she
rode
an
almost
perfect
little
mare
belonging
to
lord
talgarth
and
her
big
blue
steady
eyes
roved
slowly
round
her
as
she
went
seeing
nothing
it
was
in
fact
the
almost
perfect
little
mare
who
first
gave
warning
of
the
approach
to
the
sportsmen
by
starting
violently
all
over
at
the
sound
of
a
shot
fired
about
half
a
mile
away
jenny
steadied
her
pulled
her
up
and
watched
between
the
cocked
and
twitching
ears
below
her
converging
slowly
upwards
away
from
herself
moved
a
line
of
dots
each
precisely
like
its
neighbor
in
color
lord
talgarth
was
very
particular
indeed
about
the
uniform
of
his
beaters
and
by
each
moved
a
red
spot
which
jenny
understood
to
be
a
flag
the
point
towards
which
they
were
directed
culminated
in
a
low
rounded
hill
and
beneath
the
crown
of
this
in
a
half
circle
were
visible
a
series
of
low
defenses
like
fortifications
to
command
the
face
of
the
slope
and
the
dips
on
either
side
this
was
always
the
last
beat
in
this
moor
before
lunch
and
lunch
itself
she
knew
would
be
waiting
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
occasionally
as
she
watched
she
saw
a
slight
movement
behind
this
or
that
butt
no
more
and
the
only
evidence
of
human
beings
beside
the
beaters
lay
in
the
faint
wreath
of
all
but
invisible
smoke
that
followed
the
reports
coming
now
quicker
and
quicker
as
the
grouse
took
alarm
once
with
a
noise
like
a
badly
ignited
rocket
there
burst
over
the
curve
before
her
a
flying
brown
thing
that
screaming
with
terrified
exultation
whirred
within
twenty
yards
of
her
head
and
vanished
into
silence
one
cocked
ear
of
the
mare
bent
back
to
see
if
the
rocket
were
returning
or
not
jenny
meditations
became
more
philosophical
than
ever
as
she
looked
she
found
herself
wondering
how
much
free
choice
the
grouse
if
they
were
capable
themselves
of
philosophizing
would
imagine
themselves
to
possess
in
the
face
of
this
noisy
but
insidious
death
she
reminded
herself
that
every
shred
of
instinct
and
experience
that
each
furious
little
head
contained
bade
the
owner
of
it
to
fly
as
fast
and
straight
as
possible
in
squawking
company
with
as
many
friends
as
possible
away
from
those
horrible
personages
in
green
and
silver
with
the
agitating
red
flags
and
up
that
quiet
slope
which
at
the
worst
only
emitted
sudden
noises
a
reflective
grouse
would
perhaps
and
two
out
of
three
did
consider
that
he
could
fly
faster
and
be
sooner
hidden
from
the
green
men
with
red
flags
if
he
slid
crosswise
down
the
valleys
on
either
side
but
jenny
observed
that
was
already
calculated
by
these
human
enemies
and
butts
like
angels
swords
commanded
even
these
approaches
too
it
was
obvious
then
that
however
great
might
be
the
illusion
of
free
choice
in
reality
there
was
none
they
were
betrayed
hopelessly
by
the
very
instincts
intended
to
safeguard
them
practical
in
this
case
at
least
led
them
straight
into
the
jaws
of
death
a
little
originality
and
impulsiveness
would
render
them
immortal
so
far
as
guns
were
concerned
yes
but
there
was
one
who
had
been
original
who
had
actually
preferred
to
fly
straight
past
a
monster
in
green
on
a
gray
mare
rather
than
to
face
the
peaceful
but
deathly
slopes
and
he
had
escaped
but
obviously
he
was
an
exception
originality
in
grouse
at
this
point
the
mare
breathed
slowly
and
contemptuously
and
advanced
a
delicate
impatient
foot
having
quite
satisfied
herself
that
danger
was
no
longer
imminent
and
jenny
became
aware
she
was
thinking
nonsense
there
were
a
number
of
unimportant
but
persons
at
lunch
with
most
of
whom
jenny
was
acquainted
these
extended
themselves
on
the
ground
and
said
the
right
things
one
after
another
and
all
began
with
long
drinks
and
all
ended
with
heavy
meals
there
were
two
other
women
whom
she
knew
slightly
who
had
driven
up
half
an
hour
before
everything
was
quite
perfect
down
even
to
hot
grilled
grouse
that
emerged
from
emblazoned
silver
boxes
and
hot
black
coffee
poured
from
thermos
flasks
jenny
asked
intelligent
questions
and
made
herself
agreeable
at
the
close
of
lunch
she
found
herself
somehow
sitting
on
a
small
rock
beside
dick
lord
talgarth
was
twenty
yards
away
his
gaitered
legs
very
wide
apart
surveying
the
country
and
talking
to
the
keeper
her
father
was
looking
down
the
barrels
of
his
rather
ineffective
gun
and
archie
with
three
or
four
other
men
and
two
women
a
wife
and
a
sister
was
smoking
with
his
back
against
a
rock
shall
you
be
in
asked
dick
casually
jenny
paused
an
instant
i
should
think
so
she
said
i
got
one
or
two
things
to
do
perhaps
i
may
look
in
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
something
if
i
may
sha
you
be
shooting
again
no
i
not
very
fit
and
shall
take
a
rest
jenny
was
silent
about
what
time
pursued
dick
jenny
roused
herself
with
a
little
start
she
had
been
staring
out
over
the
hills
and
wondering
if
that
was
the
church
above
barham
that
she
could
almost
see
against
the
horizon
oh
any
time
up
to
lunch
she
said
vaguely
dick
stood
up
slowly
with
a
satisfied
air
and
stretched
himself
he
looked
very
complete
and
trim
thought
jenny
from
his
flat
cap
to
his
it
was
twelve
hundred
a
year
at
least
was
it
well
i
suppose
we
shall
be
moving
directly
he
said
a
beater
came
up
bringing
the
mare
just
before
the
start
was
made
all
right
you
can
leave
her
said
jenny
i
wo
mount
yet
just
hitch
the
bridle
on
to
something
it
was
a
pleasant
and
picturesque
sight
to
see
the
beaters
like
a
file
of
medieval
huntsmen
dwindle
down
the
hill
in
their
green
and
silver
in
one
direction
and
five
minutes
later
the
sportsmen
in
another
it
looked
like
some
mysterious
military
maneuver
on
a
small
scale
and
again
jenny
considered
the
illusion
of
free
choice
enjoyed
by
the
grouse
who
perhaps
two
miles
away
crouched
in
hollows
among
the
heather
and
yet
practically
speaking
there
was
hardly
any
choice
at
all
lady
richard
the
wife
of
one
of
the
men
interrupted
her
in
a
drawl
looks
jolly
does
it
she
said
jenny
assented
cordially
she
hated
this
woman
somehow
without
knowing
why
she
said
to
herself
it
was
the
drawl
and
the
insolent
cold
eyes
and
the
astonishing
complacency
and
she
only
half
acknowledged
that
it
was
the
beautiful
lines
of
the
dress
and
the
figure
and
the
assured
social
position
we
driving
went
on
the
tall
girl
you
rode
did
you
yes
lord
talgarth
mare
is
it
i
thought
i
recognized
her
yes
i
have
got
a
horse
of
my
own
you
know
said
jenny
deliberately
oh
jenny
suddenly
felt
her
hatred
rise
almost
to
passion
i
must
be
going
she
said
i
got
to
visit
an
old
woman
dying
a
rector
daughter
you
know
ah
yes
then
jenny
mounted
from
a
rock
lady
richard
held
the
mare
head
and
settled
the
habit
and
rode
slowly
away
downhill
iii
dick
approached
the
rectory
next
day
a
little
before
twelve
with
as
much
excitement
in
his
heart
as
he
ever
permitted
to
himself
dick
is
a
good
fellow
i
have
a
word
to
say
against
him
except
perhaps
that
he
used
to
think
that
to
be
a
guiseley
and
to
have
altogether
sixteen
hundred
a
year
and
to
live
in
a
flat
in
james
and
to
possess
a
pointed
brown
beard
and
melancholy
brown
eyes
and
a
reposeful
manner
relieved
him
from
all
further
effort
i
have
wronged
him
however
he
had
made
immense
efforts
to
be
proficient
at
billiards
and
had
really
succeeded
and
since
his
ultimate
change
of
fortune
has
embraced
even
further
responsibilities
in
a
conscientious
manner
of
course
he
had
been
in
love
before
in
a
sort
of
way
but
this
was
truly
different
he
wished
to
marry
jenny
very
much
indeed
that
she
was
remarkably
sensible
really
beautiful
and
eminently
presentable
of
course
paved
the
way
but
if
i
understand
the
matter
rightly
these
were
not
the
only
elements
in
the
case
it
was
the
genuine
thing
he
did
not
quite
know
how
he
would
face
the
future
if
she
refused
him
and
he
was
sufficiently
humble
to
be
in
doubt
the
neat
maid
told
him
at
the
door
that
miss
launton
had
given
directions
that
he
was
to
be
shown
into
the
garden
if
he
came
no
miss
launton
was
in
the
but
she
should
be
told
at
once
so
dick
strolled
across
the
lawn
and
sat
down
by
the
garden
table
he
looked
at
the
solemn
dreaming
house
in
the
late
summer
sunshine
he
observed
a
robin
issue
out
from
a
lime
tree
and
inspect
him
sideways
and
then
another
robin
issue
from
another
lime
tree
and
drive
the
first
one
away
then
he
noticed
a
smear
of
dust
on
his
own
left
boot
and
flicked
it
off
with
a
handkerchief
then
as
he
put
his
handkerchief
away
again
he
saw
jenny
coming
out
from
the
window
she
looked
really
extraordinarily
beautiful
as
she
came
slowly
across
towards
him
and
he
stood
to
meet
her
she
was
but
her
face
was
shadowed
by
the
great
coils
of
hair
she
was
in
a
perfectly
plain
pink
dress
perfectly
cut
and
she
carried
herself
superbly
she
looked
just
a
trifle
paler
than
yesterday
he
thought
and
there
was
a
very
reserved
steady
kind
of
question
in
her
eyes
i
am
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
go
on
saying
this
sort
of
thing
about
jenny
every
time
she
comes
upon
the
scene
but
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
everyone
is
obliged
to
go
on
thinking
whenever
she
makes
her
appearance
i
got
a
good
deal
to
say
said
dick
after
they
had
sat
a
moment
or
two
may
i
say
it
right
out
to
the
end
why
certainly
said
jenny
dick
leaned
back
and
crossed
one
knee
over
the
other
his
manner
was
exactly
right
at
any
rate
it
was
exactly
what
he
wished
it
to
be
and
all
through
his
little
speech
he
preserved
it
it
was
quite
restrained
extremely
civilized
and
not
at
all
artificial
it
was
his
method
of
presenting
a
fact
the
fact
that
he
really
was
in
love
with
this
girl
and
was
in
his
best
manner
there
was
a
lightness
of
touch
about
this
method
of
his
but
it
was
only
on
the
surface
i
daresay
it
rather
bad
form
my
coming
and
saying
all
this
so
soon
but
i
ca
help
that
i
know
you
must
have
gone
through
an
awful
lot
in
the
last
month
or
two
perhaps
even
longer
but
i
do
know
about
that
and
i
want
to
begin
by
apologizing
if
i
am
doing
what
i
should
the
fact
is
that
well
that
i
dare
risk
waiting
he
did
not
look
at
jenny
he
was
observing
the
robin
that
had
gone
and
come
again
since
jenny
had
appeared
but
he
was
aware
that
at
his
first
sentence
she
had
suddenly
settled
down
into
complete
motionlessness
he
wondered
whether
that
was
a
good
omen
or
not
well
now
he
said
let
me
give
a
little
account
of
myself
first
just
i
got
four
hundred
a
year
of
my
own
and
lord
talgarth
allows
me
twelve
hundred
a
year
more
then
i
got
other
expectations
as
they
say
my
uncle
gives
me
to
understand
that
my
allowance
is
secured
to
me
in
his
will
and
i
the
heir
of
my
aunt
lady
simon
whom
you
probably
met
i
just
mention
that
to
show
not
a
pauper
guiseley
began
jenny
please
wait
i
not
done
yet
do
you
mind
i
a
decent
living
man
i
not
spotless
but
i
answer
any
questions
you
like
to
put
to
your
father
i
not
got
any
profession
though
i
supposed
to
be
a
solicitor
but
i
perfectly
willing
to
work
if
if
it
wished
or
to
stand
for
parliament
or
anything
like
that
there
has
so
far
seemed
any
real
particular
reason
why
i
should
work
that
all
and
i
think
you
know
the
sort
of
person
i
am
all
round
and
now
we
come
to
the
point
dick
hesitated
a
fraction
of
a
second
he
was
genuinely
moved
the
point
is
that
i
in
love
with
you
and
i
have
been
for
some
time
past
i
i
ca
put
it
more
plainly
one
moment
please
i
nearly
done
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
and
i
have
been
able
to
for
the
last
two
or
three
months
i
i
i
fearfully
sorry
for
poor
old
frank
i
very
fond
of
him
you
know
but
i
could
help
finding
it
an
extraordinary
relief
when
i
heard
the
news
and
now
i
come
to
ask
you
perfectly
straight
whether
consent
to
be
my
wife
dick
looked
at
her
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
begun
his
little
speech
she
still
sat
absolutely
quiet
she
had
not
even
moved
at
the
two
words
she
had
uttered
but
she
had
gone
paler
still
her
mouth
was
in
repose
without
quiver
or
movement
and
her
beautiful
eyes
looked
steadily
on
to
the
lawn
before
her
she
said
nothing
if
you
ca
give
me
an
answer
quite
at
once
began
dick
again
presently
i
perfectly
willing
to
she
turned
and
looked
him
courageously
in
the
face
i
ca
say
she
said
that
would
be
absurd
you
have
been
quite
straightforward
with
me
and
i
must
be
straightforward
with
you
that
is
what
you
wish
is
it
dick
inclined
his
head
his
heart
was
thumping
furiously
with
exultation
in
spite
of
her
words
then
what
i
say
is
this
you
must
wait
a
long
time
if
you
had
insisted
on
an
answer
now
i
should
have
said
i
hate
to
keep
you
waiting
particularly
when
i
do
really
think
it
will
be
in
the
long
run
but
as
i
not
quite
sure
and
as
you
been
perfectly
honest
and
courteous
if
you
really
wish
it
i
wo
say
at
once
will
that
do
whatever
you
say
said
dick
you
must
forget
i
was
engaged
to
frank
till
quite
lately
do
you
see
how
that
obscures
one
judgment
i
simply
ca
judge
now
and
i
know
i
ca
you
willing
to
wait
then
even
though
i
tell
you
now
that
i
think
it
will
be
whatever
you
say
said
dick
again
and
may
i
say
thank
you
for
not
saying
at
once
a
very
slight
look
of
pain
came
into
the
girl
eyes
i
would
sooner
you
did
she
said
i
sorry
you
said
that
i
sorry
said
poor
dick
there
was
a
pause
one
other
thing
said
jenny
would
you
mind
not
saying
anything
to
my
father
i
do
want
him
to
be
upset
any
more
have
you
told
anybody
else
you
were
yes
said
dick
bravely
i
told
archie
i
sorry
you
did
that
will
you
then
just
tell
him
exactly
what
i
said
exactly
you
know
that
i
thought
it
would
be
but
that
i
only
did
say
so
at
once
because
you
wished
it
very
well
said
dick
it
was
a
minute
or
so
before
either
spoke
again
jenny
had
that
delightful
and
soothing
gift
which
prevents
silence
from
being
empty
it
is
the
same
gift
in
another
form
as
that
which
enables
its
possessor
to
put
people
at
their
ease
it
is
i
suppose
one
of
the
elements
of
tact
dick
had
a
sense
that
they
were
still
talking
gently
and
reasonably
though
he
could
not
quite
understand
all
that
jenny
was
meaning
she
interrupted
it
by
a
sudden
sentence
i
wonder
if
it
fair
she
said
you
know
i
all
but
certain
i
only
do
say
so
because
let
it
be
at
that
said
dick
it
my
risk
is
it
iii
when
he
had
left
her
at
last
she
sat
on
perfectly
still
in
the
same
place
the
robin
had
given
it
up
in
despair
this
human
creature
was
not
going
to
scratch
as
she
sometimes
did
and
disclose
rich
worms
and
small
fat
maggots
but
a
cat
had
come
out
instead
and
was
now
pacing
with
stiff
forelegs
lowered
head
and
trailing
tail
across
the
sunny
grass
endeavoring
to
give
an
impression
that
he
was
bent
on
some
completely
remote
business
of
his
own
he
paused
at
the
edge
of
the
shadow
and
eyed
the
girl
malignantly
wow
said
the
cat
there
was
no
response
wow
said
the
cat
jenny
roused
herself
wow
said
jenny
meditatively
wow
said
the
cat
walking
on
wow
said
jenny
again
there
was
a
long
silence
wow
said
jenny
indignantly
the
cat
turned
a
slow
head
sideways
as
he
began
to
cross
the
path
but
said
nothing
he
waited
for
another
entreaty
but
jenny
paid
no
more
attention
as
he
entered
the
yews
he
turned
once
more
wow
said
the
cat
almost
below
his
breath
but
jenny
made
no
answer
the
cat
cast
one
venomous
look
and
disappeared
then
there
came
out
a
dog
a
small
brown
and
black
animal
very
sturdy
on
his
legs
and
earnest
and
independent
in
air
and
manner
he
was
the
illegitimate
offspring
of
a
he
trotted
briskly
across
from
the
direction
of
the
orchard
diagonally
past
jenny
as
he
crossed
the
trail
of
the
cat
he
paused
smelt
and
followed
it
up
for
a
yard
or
two
till
he
identified
for
certain
that
it
proceeded
from
an
acquaintance
then
he
turned
to
resume
his
journey
the
movement
attracted
the
attention
lama
called
jenny
imperiously
come
here
this
instant
lama
put
his
head
on
one
side
nodded
and
smiled
at
her
indulgently
and
trotted
on
oh
dear
me
said
jenny
sighing
out
loud
chapter
iii
i
there
lived
and
still
lives
i
believe
in
the
small
yorkshire
village
of
tarfield
a
retired
doctor
entirely
alone
except
for
his
servants
in
a
large
house
it
is
a
very
delightful
house
only
when
i
stayed
there
not
long
ago
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
doctor
did
not
know
how
to
use
it
it
stands
in
its
own
grounds
of
two
or
three
acres
on
the
side
of
the
road
to
a
traveler
going
north
separated
by
a
row
of
pollarded
limes
from
the
village
street
and
approached
or
rather
supposed
to
be
approached
by
a
charles
ii
gate
of
work
i
say
supposed
to
be
approached
because
the
gate
is
invariably
kept
locked
and
access
can
only
be
gained
to
the
house
through
the
side
gate
from
the
the
grounds
were
abominably
neglected
when
i
saw
them
grass
was
growing
on
every
path
and
as
fine
a
crop
of
weeds
surged
up
amongst
the
old
autumn
flowers
as
ever
i
have
seen
the
house
too
was
a
sad
sight
there
here
two
big
rooms
one
on
either
side
of
the
little
one
a
the
other
a
sort
of
and
both
were
dreary
and
places
in
the
one
the
doctor
occasionally
ate
in
the
other
he
never
sat
except
when
a
rare
visitor
came
to
see
him
and
the
little
room
supposed
to
be
a
study
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
in
the
inner
hall
that
led
through
the
kitchen
was
hardly
any
better
i
was
there
i
say
last
autumn
and
the
condition
of
the
place
must
have
been
very
much
the
same
as
that
in
which
it
was
when
frank
came
to
tarfield
in
october
for
the
fact
was
that
the
doctor
who
was
possessed
of
decent
private
means
devoted
the
whole
of
his
fortune
the
whole
of
his
attention
and
the
whole
of
his
life
such
as
it
was
to
the
study
of
toxins
upstairs
toxins
i
understand
have
something
to
do
with
germs
their
study
involves
at
any
rate
at
present
a
large
stock
of
small
animals
such
as
mice
and
frogs
and
snakes
and
and
rabbits
who
are
given
various
diseases
and
then
studied
with
loving
attention
i
saw
the
doctor
menagerie
when
i
went
to
see
him
about
frank
they
were
chiefly
housed
in
a
large
room
over
the
kitchen
communicating
with
the
own
room
by
a
little
old
with
two
doors
and
the
smell
was
indescribable
ranks
of
cages
and
boxes
rose
almost
to
the
ceiling
and
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
large
looking
wooden
with
various
appliances
on
it
i
saw
the
doctor
room
also
terribly
shabby
but
undoubtedly
a
place
of
activity
there
were
piles
of
books
and
unbound
magazines
standing
about
in
corners
with
more
on
the
table
as
well
as
a
heap
of
an
array
of
glass
tubes
and
bottles
stood
below
the
window
with
a
microscope
and
small
wooden
boxes
on
one
side
and
there
was
besides
something
which
i
think
he
called
an
incubator
a
metal
affair
standing
on
four
slender
legs
a
number
of
glass
tubes
emerged
from
this
each
carefully
stoppered
with
cotton
wool
and
a
thermometer
thrust
itself
up
in
one
corner
a
really
high
degree
of
proficiency
in
any
particular
subject
invariably
leads
to
atrophy
in
other
directions
a
man
who
eats
and
breathes
and
dreams
toxins
for
instance
who
lives
so
much
in
toxins
that
he
corresponds
almost
daily
with
learned
and
unintelligible
germans
who
knows
so
much
about
toxins
that
when
he
enters
with
shabby
trousers
and
a
small
into
the
room
of
a
polished
specialist
in
harley
street
he
sees
as
in
a
dream
the
specialist
rise
and
bow
before
him
who
when
he
can
be
persuaded
to
contribute
a
short
and
highly
technical
article
to
a
medical
magazine
receives
a
check
for
guineas
by
return
of
post
a
man
of
this
kind
is
peculiarly
open
to
the
danger
of
thinking
that
anything
which
can
not
be
expressed
in
terms
of
toxin
is
negligible
nonsense
it
is
the
characteristic
danger
of
every
specialist
in
every
branch
of
knowledge
even
theologians
are
not
wholly
immune
it
was
so
in
the
case
of
whitty
i
forget
all
the
initials
that
should
follow
his
name
he
had
never
been
married
he
never
took
any
exercise
occasionally
when
a
frog
temperature
approached
a
crisis
he
slept
in
his
clothes
and
forgot
to
change
them
in
the
morning
and
he
was
the
despair
of
the
zealous
vicar
he
was
perfectly
convinced
that
since
the
force
that
underlay
the
production
of
toxins
could
accomplish
so
much
it
could
surely
accomplish
everything
he
could
reduce
his
roses
his
own
complexion
the
grass
on
his
the
condition
of
his
snakes
and
frogs
skins
and
the
texture
of
his
if
you
gave
him
time
to
terms
of
toxin
therefore
argued
whitty
you
could
if
you
had
more
time
reduce
everything
else
to
the
same
terms
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
soul
of
course
it
was
a
manifestation
of
a
combination
of
toxins
or
i
forget
which
there
was
no
god
the
idea
of
god
was
the
result
of
another
combination
of
toxins
akin
to
a
belief
in
the
former
illusion
roughly
speaking
i
think
his
general
position
was
that
as
toxins
are
a
secretion
of
microbes
i
am
certain
of
that
phrase
anyhow
so
thought
and
spiritual
experiences
and
so
forth
are
a
secretion
of
the
brain
i
know
it
sounded
all
very
brilliant
and
unanswerable
and
analogous
to
other
things
he
hardly
ever
took
the
trouble
to
say
all
this
he
was
far
too
much
interested
in
what
he
already
knew
or
was
just
on
the
point
of
finding
out
to
treat
of
these
extravagant
and
complicated
ramifications
of
his
subject
when
he
really
got
to
know
his
mice
and
bats
as
they
deserved
to
be
known
it
might
be
possible
to
turn
his
attention
to
other
things
meanwhile
it
was
foolish
and
uneconomical
so
here
he
lived
with
a
and
his
man
wife
and
daily
went
from
strength
to
strength
in
the
knowledge
of
toxins
it
was
to
this
household
that
there
approached
in
the
month
of
october
a
small
and
dismal
procession
of
three
the
doctor
was
first
roused
to
a
sense
of
what
was
happening
as
he
shuffled
swiftly
through
his
little
one
morning
soon
after
breakfast
bearing
in
his
hand
the
corpse
of
a
mouse
which
had
at
last
and
most
disappointingly
succumbed
to
a
severe
attack
of
some
hybrid
of
leprosy
as
he
flew
through
to
his
microscope
he
became
aware
of
an
altercation
in
the
beneath
i
tell
you
he
ai
a
proper
doctor
he
heard
his
man
explaining
he
knows
nothing
about
them
things
my
good
fellow
began
a
high
superior
voice
out
of
sight
but
whitty
swept
on
and
was
presently
deep
in
indescribable
disgustingness
of
the
highest
possible
value
to
the
human
race
especially
in
the
south
seas
time
meant
nothing
at
all
to
him
when
this
kind
of
work
was
in
hand
and
it
was
after
what
might
be
an
hour
or
two
hours
or
ten
minutes
that
he
heard
a
tap
on
his
door
he
uttered
a
sound
without
moving
his
eye
and
the
door
opened
very
sorry
sir
said
his
man
but
there
a
party
in
the
yard
as
wo
the
doctor
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
gazed
a
few
moments
longer
poked
some
dreadful
little
object
two
or
three
times
sighed
and
sat
back
eh
there
a
party
in
the
yard
sir
wants
a
doctor
this
sort
of
thing
had
happened
before
tell
them
to
be
off
he
said
sharply
he
was
not
an
unkindly
man
but
this
sort
of
thing
was
impossible
tell
them
to
go
to
dr
foster
i
sir
said
the
man
tell
them
again
said
the
doctor
i
sir
a
dozen
times
the
doctor
sighed
he
was
paying
practically
no
attention
at
all
of
course
the
leprous
mouse
had
been
discouraging
that
was
all
if
you
step
down
sir
an
instant
the
doctor
returned
from
soaring
through
a
toxined
universe
nonsense
he
said
sharply
tell
them
i
not
practicing
what
do
they
want
please
sir
it
a
young
man
as
poisoned
foot
says
looks
very
bad
and
eh
poison
yes
sir
the
doctor
appeared
to
reflect
a
moment
that
mouse
you
know
then
he
recovered
i
be
down
directly
he
said
almost
mechanically
take
all
into
the
study
ii
whitty
could
hardly
explain
to
me
even
when
he
tried
exactly
why
he
had
made
an
exception
in
this
particular
instance
of
course
i
understand
perfectly
myself
why
he
did
but
for
himself
all
he
could
say
was
that
he
supposed
the
word
poison
happened
to
meet
his
mood
he
had
honestly
done
with
the
mouse
just
now
he
had
no
other
very
critical
case
and
he
thought
he
might
as
well
look
at
the
poisoned
young
man
for
an
instant
before
finally
despatching
him
to
foster
six
miles
further
on
when
he
came
into
the
study
ten
minutes
later
he
found
the
party
ranged
to
meet
him
a
girl
was
sitting
on
a
box
in
the
corner
by
the
window
and
stood
up
to
receive
him
a
young
man
was
sitting
back
in
a
windsor
chair
with
one
boot
off
jerking
spasmodically
his
eyes
stared
unmeaningly
before
him
a
tallish
lean
man
of
a
particularly
unprepossessing
appearance
was
leaning
over
him
with
an
air
of
immense
solicitude
they
were
all
three
evidently
of
the
what
they
saw
with
the
exception
of
frank
i
expect
who
was
too
far
gone
to
notice
anything
was
a
old
man
very
shabby
in
an
alpaca
jacket
with
a
rusty
velvet
cap
on
his
head
and
very
bright
eyes
behind
round
spectacles
this
figure
appeared
in
the
doorway
stood
looking
at
them
a
moment
as
if
bewildered
as
to
why
he
or
they
were
there
at
all
and
then
with
a
hasty
shuffling
movement
darted
across
the
floor
and
down
on
his
knees
the
following
colloquy
was
held
as
soon
as
the
last
roll
of
defiled
bandage
had
dropped
to
the
floor
and
frank
foot
was
disclosed
how
long
this
been
going
on
asked
the
doctor
sharply
holding
the
discolored
thing
carefully
in
his
two
hands
well
sir
said
the
major
reflectively
he
began
to
limp
about
see
four
days
ago
we
were
coming
through
the
doctor
watching
frank
face
curiously
the
spasm
was
over
for
the
present
cut
the
major
short
by
a
question
to
the
patient
now
my
boy
how
feel
now
frank
lips
moved
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
lick
them
but
he
said
nothing
and
his
eyes
closed
and
he
grinned
once
or
twice
as
if
sardonically
when
did
these
spasms
begin
went
on
the
doctor
abruptly
turning
to
the
major
again
well
sir
if
you
mean
that
jerking
frankie
began
to
jerk
about
half
an
hour
ago
when
we
were
sitting
down
a
bit
but
he
seemed
queer
since
breakfast
and
he
did
seem
to
be
able
to
eat
properly
how
do
you
mean
mean
he
could
open
his
mouth
well
sir
it
was
something
like
that
the
doctor
began
to
make
comments
in
a
rapid
undertone
as
if
talking
to
himself
he
pressed
his
hand
once
or
twice
against
frank
stomach
he
took
up
the
filthy
bandage
and
examined
it
then
he
looked
at
the
boot
where
the
sock
he
asked
sharply
gertie
produced
it
from
a
bundle
he
looked
at
it
closely
and
began
to
mumble
again
then
he
rose
to
his
feet
what
the
matter
with
him
doctor
asked
the
major
trying
to
look
perturbed
we
call
it
tetanus
said
the
doctor
who
are
you
my
man
he
said
any
relation
the
major
looked
at
him
loftily
no
sir
i
am
his
friend
ha
then
you
must
leave
your
friend
in
my
charge
he
shall
be
well
in
a
week
at
the
latest
the
major
was
silent
well
snapped
the
doctor
i
understood
from
your
servant
sir
you
speak
like
an
educated
man
i
am
an
educated
man
ha
well
no
business
of
mine
what
were
you
about
to
say
i
understood
from
your
servant
sir
that
this
was
not
quite
in
your
line
and
since
the
specialist
smiled
grimly
he
snatched
up
a
book
from
a
pile
on
the
table
thrust
open
the
and
held
it
out
read
that
sir
as
it
happens
it
my
hobby
go
and
ask
foster
if
you
like
no
sir
i
must
have
your
friend
it
a
good
sound
case
the
major
read
the
in
a
superior
manner
it
purported
to
be
by
a
james
whitty
and
the
name
was
followed
by
a
series
of
distinctions
and
of
the
initials
which
i
have
forgotten
were
the
first
my
name
said
the
doctor
the
major
handed
the
book
back
with
a
bow
i
am
proud
to
make
your
acquaintance
whitty
i
have
heard
of
you
may
i
present
mrs
trustcott
gertie
looked
confused
the
doctor
made
a
stiff
obeisance
then
his
face
became
animated
again
we
must
move
your
friend
upstairs
he
said
if
you
will
help
trustcott
i
will
call
my
servant
iii
it
was
about
nine
that
night
that
the
doctor
having
rung
the
bell
in
the
spare
bedroom
met
his
man
at
the
threshold
i
sleep
in
this
room
he
said
you
can
go
to
bed
bring
in
a
mattress
will
you
the
man
looked
at
his
master
face
he
looked
reported
thomas
later
to
his
wife
hope
the
young
man
doing
well
sir
a
spasm
went
over
the
doctor
face
most
extraordinary
young
man
in
the
world
he
said
then
he
broke
off
bring
the
mattress
at
once
thomas
then
you
can
go
to
bed
he
went
back
and
closed
the
door
thomas
had
seldom
seen
his
master
so
perturbed
over
a
human
being
before
he
wondered
what
on
earth
was
the
matter
during
the
few
minutes
that
he
was
in
the
room
he
looked
at
the
patient
curiously
and
he
noticed
that
the
doctor
was
continually
looking
at
him
too
thomas
described
to
me
frank
appearance
he
was
very
much
flushed
he
said
with
very
bright
eyes
and
he
was
talking
incessantly
and
it
was
evidently
this
delirious
talking
that
had
upset
the
doctor
i
tried
to
get
out
of
doctor
whitty
what
it
was
that
frank
had
actually
said
but
the
doctor
shut
up
his
face
tight
and
would
say
nothing
thomas
was
more
communicative
though
far
from
adequate
it
was
about
religion
he
said
that
frank
was
talking
about
religion
and
that
was
really
about
all
that
he
could
say
of
that
incident
thomas
awoke
about
one
that
night
and
still
with
the
uneasiness
that
he
had
had
earlier
in
the
evening
climbed
out
of
bed
without
disturbing
his
wife
put
on
his
slippers
and
and
made
his
way
down
the
attic
stairs
the
october
moon
was
up
and
shining
through
the
staircase
window
showed
him
the
door
of
the
spare
bedroom
with
a
line
of
light
beneath
it
from
beyond
that
door
came
the
steady
murmur
of
a
voice
now
thomas
nerves
were
strong
he
was
a
little
lean
kind
of
man
very
wiry
and
active
nearly
fifty
years
old
and
he
had
lived
with
his
master
and
the
mice
and
the
snakes
and
disagreeable
objects
in
bottles
for
more
than
sixteen
years
he
had
been
a
male
nurse
in
an
asylum
before
that
yet
there
was
something
he
told
me
later
that
gripped
him
suddenly
as
he
was
down
the
stairs
and
held
him
in
a
kind
of
agony
which
he
could
in
no
way
describe
it
was
connected
with
the
room
behind
that
lighted
door
it
was
not
that
he
feared
for
his
master
nor
for
frank
it
was
something
else
altogether
what
a
pity
it
is
that
our
system
of
education
teaches
neither
nor
the
art
of
narration
he
stood
there
he
told
me
he
should
think
for
the
better
part
of
ten
minutes
unable
to
move
either
way
listening
always
listening
to
the
voice
that
rose
and
sank
and
lapsed
now
and
then
into
silences
that
were
worse
than
all
and
telling
himself
vigorously
that
he
was
not
at
all
frightened
it
was
a
creak
somewhere
in
the
old
house
that
disturbed
him
and
snapped
the
thin
rigid
little
thread
that
seemed
to
paralyze
his
soul
and
still
in
a
sort
of
terror
though
no
longer
in
the
same
stiff
agony
he
made
his
way
down
the
three
or
four
further
steps
of
the
flight
laid
hold
of
the
handle
turned
it
and
peered
in
frank
was
lying
quiet
so
far
as
he
could
see
a
burned
by
the
bottles
and
syringes
on
the
table
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
although
shaded
from
the
young
man
face
still
diffused
enough
light
to
shoes
the
servant
the
figure
lying
there
and
his
master
seated
beyond
the
bed
very
close
to
it
still
in
his
still
even
in
his
velvet
cap
his
chin
propped
in
his
hand
staring
down
at
his
patient
utterly
absorbed
and
attentive
there
was
nothing
particularly
alarming
in
all
that
and
yet
there
was
that
in
the
room
which
once
more
seized
the
man
at
his
heart
and
held
him
there
rigid
again
terrified
and
above
all
inexpressibly
awed
at
least
that
is
how
i
should
interpret
his
description
he
said
that
it
was
like
the
spare
bedroom
at
all
as
he
ordinarily
knew
it
and
indeed
it
was
a
mean
sort
of
room
when
i
saw
it
without
a
fireplace
though
of
tolerable
size
it
was
like
another
room
altogether
said
thomas
he
tried
to
listen
to
what
frank
was
saying
and
i
imagine
he
heard
it
all
quite
intelligently
yet
once
more
all
he
could
say
afterwards
was
that
it
was
about
religion
about
religion
so
he
stood
till
he
suddenly
perceived
that
the
doctor
was
looking
at
him
with
a
frown
and
contorted
features
of
eloquence
he
understood
that
he
was
to
go
he
closed
the
door
noiselessly
and
after
another
pause
sped
upstairs
without
a
sound
in
his
red
cloth
slippers
iv
when
frank
awoke
to
normal
consciousness
again
he
lay
still
wondering
what
it
was
all
about
he
saw
a
table
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
and
noticed
on
it
a
small
leather
case
two
green
bottles
stoppered
with
and
a
small
covered
bowl
looking
as
if
it
contained
he
extended
his
explorations
still
further
and
discovered
an
hanoverian
wardrobe
against
the
left
wall
a
glare
of
light
which
he
presently
discerned
to
be
a
window
a
dingy
and
finally
a
door
as
he
reached
this
point
the
door
opened
and
an
old
man
with
a
velvet
spectacles
and
a
kind
furrowed
face
came
in
and
stood
over
him
well
said
the
old
man
i
am
a
bit
stiff
said
frank
are
you
hungry
i
do
think
so
well
you
doing
very
well
if
that
any
satisfaction
to
you
observed
the
doctor
frowning
on
him
doubtfully
frank
said
nothing
the
doctor
sat
down
on
a
chair
by
the
bed
that
frank
suddenly
noticed
for
the
first
time
well
said
the
doctor
i
suppose
you
want
to
know
the
facts
here
they
are
my
name
is
whitty
i
a
doctor
you
in
my
house
this
is
wednesday
afternoon
your
friends
brought
you
here
yesterday
morning
i
given
them
some
work
in
the
garden
you
were
ill
yesterday
but
you
all
right
now
what
was
the
matter
we
wo
bother
about
names
said
the
doctor
with
a
kind
sharpness
you
had
a
blister
it
broke
and
became
a
sore
then
you
wore
one
of
those
nasty
cheap
socks
and
it
poisoned
it
that
all
that
in
those
bottles
asked
frank
languidly
he
felt
amazingly
weak
and
stupid
well
it
an
said
the
doctor
that
does
tell
you
much
does
it
no
said
frank
by
the
way
who
going
to
pay
you
doctor
i
ca
the
doctor
face
rumpled
up
into
wrinkles
frank
wished
he
sit
with
his
back
to
the
window
do
you
bother
about
that
my
boy
you
a
case
that
what
you
are
frank
attempted
a
smile
out
of
politeness
now
how
about
some
more
and
then
going
to
sleep
again
frank
assented
it
was
not
until
the
thursday
morning
that
things
began
to
run
really
clear
again
in
frank
mind
he
felt
for
his
rosary
under
his
pillow
and
it
was
there
then
he
thumped
on
the
floor
with
a
short
stick
which
had
been
placed
by
him
remembering
that
in
some
previous
existence
he
had
been
told
to
do
this
a
small
lean
man
appeared
at
the
door
it
seemed
with
the
quickness
of
thought
my
rosary
please
said
frank
it
a
string
of
beads
i
expect
in
my
the
man
looked
at
him
with
extraordinary
earnestness
and
vanished
then
the
doctor
appeared
holding
the
rosary
is
this
what
you
want
he
asked
that
it
thanks
very
much
you
a
catholic
went
on
the
other
giving
it
him
yes
the
doctor
sat
down
again
i
thought
so
he
said
frank
wondered
why
then
a
thought
crossed
his
mind
have
i
been
talking
he
said
i
suppose
i
was
delirious
the
doctor
made
no
answer
for
a
moment
he
was
looking
at
him
fixedly
then
he
roused
himself
well
yes
you
have
he
said
frank
felt
rather
uncomfortable
hope
i
have
said
anything
i
should
the
old
man
laughed
shortly
and
grimly
oh
no
he
said
far
from
it
at
least
your
friends
would
think
so
what
was
it
about
we
talk
about
that
later
if
you
like
said
the
doctor
now
i
want
you
to
get
up
a
bit
after
you
had
some
food
it
was
with
a
very
strange
sensation
that
frank
found
himself
out
in
the
garden
next
day
in
a
sheltered
corner
seated
in
a
wicker
chair
in
which
by
the
help
of
bamboo
poles
he
had
been
carried
downstairs
by
thomas
and
the
major
with
the
doctor
leading
the
way
and
giving
directions
as
to
how
to
turn
the
corners
the
chair
was
brought
out
through
an
little
court
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
set
down
in
the
warm
autumn
noon
against
an
old
wall
with
a
big
kitchen
garden
terribly
neglected
spread
before
him
the
smoke
of
burning
went
up
in
the
middle
distance
denoting
the
heap
of
weeds
pulled
by
the
major
and
gertie
during
the
last
three
days
he
saw
gertie
in
the
distance
once
or
twice
in
a
clean
going
about
her
business
but
she
made
no
sign
the
smell
of
the
burning
weeds
gave
a
pleasant
wholesome
and
acrid
taste
to
his
mouth
now
then
said
the
doctor
we
can
have
our
little
talk
and
he
sat
down
beside
him
on
another
chair
frank
felt
a
little
nervous
he
scarcely
knew
why
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
would
be
far
better
not
to
refer
to
the
past
at
all
and
it
appeared
to
him
a
little
unusual
that
a
doctor
should
be
so
anxious
about
it
twice
or
three
times
since
yesterday
this
old
man
had
begun
to
ask
him
a
question
and
had
checked
himself
there
was
a
very
curious
eagerness
about
him
now
i
awfully
grateful
and
all
that
said
frank
is
there
anything
special
you
want
to
know
i
suppose
i
been
talking
about
my
people
the
doctor
waved
a
wrinkled
hand
no
no
he
said
not
a
word
you
talked
about
a
girl
a
little
of
course
everybody
does
but
not
much
no
it
is
that
frank
felt
relieved
he
was
anxious
about
anything
else
i
glad
of
that
by
the
way
may
i
smoke
the
doctor
produced
a
leather
case
of
cigarettes
and
held
it
out
take
one
of
these
he
said
because
continued
frank
i
afraid
i
must
talk
about
my
people
the
name
i
got
now
is
gregory
you
know
he
lit
his
cigarette
noticing
how
his
fingers
still
shook
and
dropped
the
match
no
it
not
about
that
said
the
doctor
it
not
about
that
frank
glanced
at
him
astonished
by
his
manner
well
then
he
began
i
want
to
know
first
said
the
doctor
slowly
where
you
got
all
your
ideas
from
i
never
heard
such
a
jumble
in
my
life
i
know
you
were
delirious
but
but
it
hung
together
somehow
and
it
seemed
much
more
real
to
you
than
anything
else
what
did
asked
frank
uncomfortably
the
doctor
made
no
answer
for
a
moment
he
looked
out
across
the
untidy
garden
with
its
rich
faded
finery
of
wild
flowers
and
autumn
leaves
and
the
yellowing
foliage
beyond
the
wall
and
the
moors
behind
all
transfigured
in
october
sunshine
the
smoke
of
the
burning
weeds
drew
heavenly
lines
and
folds
of
ethereal
across
the
dull
splendors
beyond
well
he
said
at
last
everything
you
know
i
heard
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
folks
he
broke
off
again
and
i
know
what
people
call
religion
about
here
and
such
a
pack
of
nonsense
he
turned
on
frank
again
suddenly
where
get
your
ideas
from
do
you
mean
the
catholic
religion
said
frank
bah
do
call
it
that
i
know
what
that
is
frank
interrupted
him
well
that
my
religion
he
said
i
have
got
any
other
but
but
the
way
you
hold
it
cried
the
other
the
grip
the
grip
it
has
of
you
that
the
point
mean
to
tell
me
i
mean
that
i
do
care
for
anything
else
in
the
whole
world
said
frank
stung
with
sudden
enthusiasm
but
but
you
not
mad
you
a
very
sensible
fellow
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
really
believe
all
that
all
that
about
pain
and
so
on
we
doctors
know
perfectly
what
all
that
is
it
a
reaction
of
nature
a
warning
to
look
out
it
often
simply
the
effects
of
building
up
and
we
beginning
to
think
ah
that
wo
interest
you
listen
to
me
i
what
they
call
a
specialist
an
investigator
i
can
tell
you
without
conceit
that
i
probably
know
all
that
is
to
be
known
on
a
certain
subject
well
i
can
tell
you
as
an
authority
frank
lifted
his
head
a
little
he
was
keenly
interested
by
the
fire
with
which
this
other
enthusiast
spoke
i
daresay
you
can
said
frank
and
i
daresay
it
all
perfectly
true
but
what
in
the
world
has
all
that
got
to
do
with
it
with
the
use
made
of
it
the
meaning
of
it
now
i
hush
hush
said
the
doctor
we
must
get
excited
that
no
good
he
stopped
and
stared
mournfully
out
again
i
wish
you
could
really
tell
me
he
said
more
slowly
but
that
just
what
you
ca
i
know
that
it
a
personal
thing
but
my
dear
doctor
said
frank
that
enough
said
the
other
i
was
an
old
fool
to
think
it
possible
frank
interrupted
again
in
his
turn
he
was
conscious
of
that
extraordinary
mental
clearness
that
comes
sometimes
to
convalescents
and
he
suddenly
perceived
there
was
something
behind
all
this
which
had
not
yet
made
its
appearance
you
some
reason
for
asking
all
this
he
said
i
wish
you
tell
me
exactly
what
in
your
mind
the
old
man
turned
and
looked
at
him
with
a
kind
of
doubtful
fixedness
why
do
you
say
that
my
boy
people
like
you
said
frank
smiling
do
get
excited
over
people
like
me
unless
there
something
i
was
at
cambridge
you
know
i
know
the
dons
there
and
well
i
tell
you
said
the
doctor
drawing
a
long
breath
i
meant
to
i
know
it
mere
nonsense
but
he
stopped
an
instant
and
called
aloud
thomas
thomas
thomas
lean
head
like
a
bird
popped
out
from
a
window
in
the
kitchen
court
behind
come
here
a
minute
thomas
came
and
stood
before
them
with
a
piece
of
in
one
hand
and
a
plated
in
the
other
i
want
you
to
tell
this
young
gentleman
said
the
doctor
deliberately
what
you
told
me
on
wednesday
morning
thomas
looked
doubtfully
from
one
to
the
other
it
was
my
fancy
sir
he
said
never
mind
about
that
tell
us
both
well
sir
i
did
like
it
seemed
to
me
when
i
looked
in
he
looked
in
on
us
in
the
middle
of
the
night
explained
the
doctor
yes
go
on
thomas
seemed
to
me
there
was
something
queer
yes
said
the
doctor
encouragingly
something
queer
repeated
thomas
musingly
and
now
if
excuse
me
sir
i
have
to
get
back
the
doctor
waved
his
hands
despairingly
as
thomas
scuttled
back
without
another
word
it
no
good
he
said
no
good
and
yet
he
told
me
quite
intelligibly
frank
was
laughing
quietly
to
himself
but
you
have
told
me
one
word
do
laugh
said
the
old
man
simply
look
here
my
boy
it
no
laughing
matter
i
tell
you
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
bothering
me
but
the
doctor
waved
his
hands
well
he
said
i
can
say
it
no
better
it
was
the
whole
thing
the
way
you
looked
the
way
you
spoke
it
was
most
unusual
but
it
affected
me
it
affected
me
in
the
same
way
and
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
could
explain
v
it
was
not
until
the
monday
afternoon
that
frank
persuaded
the
doctor
to
let
him
go
whitty
said
everything
possible
in
his
emphatic
way
as
to
the
risk
of
traveling
again
too
soon
and
there
was
one
scene
actually
conducted
in
the
menagerie
the
only
occasion
on
which
the
doctor
mentioned
frank
relations
during
which
he
besought
the
young
man
to
be
sensible
and
to
allow
him
to
communicate
with
his
family
frank
flatly
refused
without
giving
reasons
the
doctor
seemed
strangely
shy
of
referring
again
to
the
conversation
in
the
garden
and
for
his
part
frank
shut
up
like
a
box
they
seem
both
to
have
been
extraordinarily
puzzled
at
one
another
as
such
people
occasionally
are
they
were
as
two
persons
both
intelligent
and
interested
entirely
divided
by
the
absence
of
any
common
language
or
even
of
symbols
words
that
each
used
meant
different
things
to
the
other
it
strikes
me
sometimes
that
the
curse
of
babel
was
a
deeper
thing
than
appears
on
the
surface
the
major
and
gertie
all
this
while
were
in
clover
the
doctor
had
no
conception
of
what
six
hours
manual
work
could
or
could
not
do
and
in
return
for
these
hours
he
made
over
to
the
two
a
small
disused
gardener
cottage
at
the
end
of
his
grounds
some
bedding
their
meals
and
a
shilling
the
day
it
was
wonderful
how
solicitous
the
major
was
as
to
frank
not
traveling
again
until
it
was
certain
he
was
capable
of
it
but
frank
had
acquired
a
somewhat
short
and
decisive
way
with
his
friend
and
announced
that
monday
night
must
see
them
all
cleared
out
the
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
gather
was
rather
surprisingly
emotional
the
doctor
took
frank
apart
into
the
study
where
he
had
first
seen
him
and
had
a
short
conversation
during
which
one
sovereign
finally
passed
from
the
doctor
to
the
patient
i
have
often
tried
to
represent
to
myself
exactly
what
elements
there
were
in
frank
that
had
such
an
effect
upon
this
wise
and
positive
old
man
he
had
been
a
very
upsetting
visitor
in
many
ways
he
had
distracted
his
benefactor
from
a
very
important
mouse
that
had
died
of
leprosy
he
had
interfered
sadly
with
working
hours
he
had
turned
the
house
comparatively
speaking
upside
down
worse
than
all
he
had
i
will
not
say
modified
the
doctor
theories
that
would
be
far
too
strong
a
phrase
but
he
had
quite
unconsciously
run
full
tilt
against
them
and
finally
worst
of
all
he
had
done
this
right
in
the
middle
of
the
doctor
own
private
preserve
there
was
absolutely
every
element
necessary
to
explain
frank
remarks
during
his
delirium
he
was
a
boy
poisoned
by
a
toxin
and
treated
by
the
what
in
the
world
could
be
expected
but
that
he
should
rave
in
the
most
fantastic
way
and
utter
every
mad
conception
and
idea
that
his
subjective
self
contained
as
for
that
absurd
fancy
of
the
doctor
himself
as
well
as
of
his
servant
that
there
was
something
queer
in
the
room
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
less
he
valued
it
obviously
it
was
the
result
of
a
peculiar
combination
of
psychological
conditions
just
as
psychological
conditions
were
themselves
the
result
of
an
obscure
combination
of
toxin
or
forces
yet
for
all
that
argue
as
one
may
the
fact
remained
that
this
dry
and
rather
misanthropic
scientist
was
affected
in
an
astonishing
manner
by
frank
personality
it
will
appear
later
on
in
frank
history
that
the
effect
was
more
or
less
permanent
still
more
remarkable
to
my
mind
was
the
very
strong
affection
that
frank
conceived
for
the
doctor
there
is
no
mystery
coming
the
doctor
will
not
ultimately
turn
out
to
be
frank
father
in
disguise
lord
talgarth
still
retains
that
distinction
but
it
is
plainly
revealed
by
frank
diary
that
he
was
drawn
to
this
elderly
man
by
very
much
the
same
kind
of
feelings
as
a
son
might
have
and
yet
it
is
hardly
possible
to
conceive
two
characters
with
less
in
common
the
doctor
was
a
dogmatic
materialist
and
remains
so
still
frank
was
a
catholic
the
doctor
was
scientific
to
his
frank
romantic
to
the
same
extremities
the
doctor
was
old
and
a
confirmed
frank
was
young
and
an
incorrigible
gipsy
yet
so
the
matter
was
i
have
certain
ideas
of
my
own
but
there
is
no
use
in
stating
them
beyond
saying
perhaps
that
each
recognized
in
the
other
only
since
each
professed
himself
utterly
unable
to
sympathize
in
the
smallest
degree
with
the
views
of
the
other
a
certain
fixity
of
devotion
that
was
the
in
each
life
certainly
on
the
surface
there
are
not
two
theories
less
unlike
than
the
one
which
finds
the
solution
of
all
things
in
toxin
and
the
other
which
finds
it
in
god
but
perhaps
there
is
a
reconciliation
somewhere
the
major
and
gertie
were
waiting
in
the
when
the
two
other
men
emerged
the
major
had
a
large
bag
of
apples
given
him
by
thomas
at
the
doctor
orders
which
he
was
proceeding
to
add
to
gertie
load
at
the
very
moment
when
the
two
others
came
out
frank
took
them
without
a
word
and
slung
them
over
his
own
back
the
doctor
stood
blinking
a
moment
in
the
strong
sunshine
well
my
boy
he
said
good
luck
remember
that
if
ever
you
come
this
way
again
sir
said
frank
he
held
out
his
disengaged
hand
then
an
astonishing
thing
happened
the
doctor
took
the
hand
then
dropped
it
threw
his
arms
round
the
boy
neck
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
and
hurried
back
through
the
garden
gate
slamming
it
behind
him
and
i
imagine
he
ran
upstairs
at
once
to
see
how
the
mice
were
well
that
is
the
whole
of
the
incident
the
two
have
met
since
that
i
am
aware
and
i
scarcely
know
why
i
have
included
it
in
this
book
but
i
was
able
to
put
it
together
from
various
witnesses
documentary
and
personal
and
it
seemed
a
pity
to
leave
it
out
chapter
iv
i
an
enormous
physical
weariness
settled
down
on
frank
as
he
trudged
silently
with
the
major
towards
evening
a
week
later
he
had
worked
all
the
previous
day
in
a
carting
manure
and
the
like
and
though
he
was
perfectly
well
again
some
of
the
spring
had
ebbed
from
his
muscles
during
his
week
rest
this
day
too
the
first
of
november
had
been
exhausting
they
had
walked
since
daybreak
after
a
wretched
night
in
a
barn
plodding
almost
in
silence
mile
after
mile
against
a
wet
wind
over
a
discouraging
kind
of
that
dipped
and
rose
and
dipped
again
and
never
seemed
to
arrive
anywhere
it
is
true
that
frank
was
no
longer
intensely
depressed
quite
another
process
had
been
at
work
upon
him
for
the
last
two
or
three
months
as
will
be
seen
presently
but
his
limbs
seemed
leaden
and
the
actual
stiffness
in
his
shoulders
and
loins
made
walking
a
little
difficult
they
were
all
tired
together
they
did
not
say
much
to
one
another
they
had
in
fact
said
all
that
there
was
to
be
said
months
ago
and
they
were
reduced
as
men
always
are
reduced
when
a
certain
pitch
is
reached
to
speak
simply
of
the
most
elementary
bodily
things
food
tobacco
and
sleep
the
major
droned
on
now
and
then
recalling
luxuries
of
past
days
actual
roofs
over
the
head
actual
hot
meat
to
put
in
the
mouth
actual
cigars
and
frank
answered
him
gertie
said
nothing
she
made
up
for
it
soon
after
dark
had
fallen
by
quite
suddenly
collapsing
into
a
hedge
and
announcing
that
she
would
die
if
she
rest
the
major
made
the
usual
remarks
and
she
made
no
answer
frank
interposed
suddenly
shut
up
he
said
we
ca
stop
here
i
go
on
a
bit
and
see
what
can
be
done
and
as
he
went
off
into
the
darkness
leaving
his
bundle
he
heard
the
scolding
voice
begin
again
but
it
was
on
a
lower
key
and
he
knew
it
would
presently
subside
into
a
grumble
soothed
by
tobacco
he
had
no
idea
as
to
the
character
of
the
road
that
lay
before
him
they
had
passed
through
a
few
villages
that
afternoon
whose
names
meant
nothing
to
him
and
he
scarcely
knew
why
even
they
were
going
along
this
particular
road
they
were
moving
southwards
towards
london
so
much
had
been
agreed
and
they
proposed
to
arrive
there
in
another
month
or
so
but
the
country
was
unfamiliar
to
him
and
the
people
seemed
grudging
and
uncouth
they
had
twice
been
refused
the
use
of
an
outhouse
for
the
night
that
afternoon
it
seemed
an
extraordinarily
deserted
road
there
were
no
lights
from
houses
so
far
as
he
could
make
out
and
the
four
miles
that
had
been
declared
at
their
last
to
separate
them
from
the
next
village
appeared
already
more
like
five
or
six
certainly
the
three
of
them
had
between
two
and
three
shillings
all
told
there
was
no
actual
need
of
a
workhouse
just
yet
but
naturally
it
was
wished
to
spend
as
little
as
possible
then
on
a
sudden
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
light
burning
somewhere
that
appeared
and
vanished
again
as
he
moved
and
fifty
yards
more
brought
him
to
a
wide
sweep
a
pair
of
with
the
gate
fastened
back
and
a
lodge
on
the
side
so
much
he
could
make
out
dimly
through
the
november
darkness
and
as
he
stood
there
hesitating
he
thought
he
could
see
somewhere
below
him
a
few
other
lights
burning
through
the
masses
of
leafless
trees
through
which
the
drive
went
downhill
he
knew
very
well
by
experience
that
were
taken
altogether
perhaps
the
most
unsympathetic
class
in
the
community
they
live
you
see
right
on
the
high
road
and
see
human
nature
at
its
hottest
and
crossest
as
well
as
its
most
dishonest
servants
at
back
doors
were
as
a
rule
infinitely
more
obliging
and
as
obviously
this
was
the
entrance
to
some
big
country
house
the
right
thing
to
do
would
be
to
steal
past
the
lodge
on
tiptoe
and
seek
his
fortune
amongst
the
trees
yet
he
hesitated
the
house
might
be
half
a
mile
away
for
all
he
knew
and
certainly
there
was
a
hospitable
look
about
the
gate
there
came
a
gust
of
wind
over
the
hills
behind
him
laden
with
wet
he
turned
went
up
to
the
lodge
door
and
knocked
he
could
hear
someone
moving
about
inside
and
just
as
he
was
beginning
to
wonder
whether
his
double
tap
had
been
audible
the
door
opened
and
disclosed
a
woman
in
an
apron
can
you
very
kindly
direct
me
began
frank
politely
the
woman
jerked
her
head
sharply
in
the
direction
of
the
house
straight
down
the
hill
she
said
them
the
orders
but
it
was
no
good
the
door
was
shut
again
in
his
face
and
he
stood
alone
in
the
dark
this
was
all
very
unusual
did
not
usually
receive
orders
to
send
tramps
without
credentials
on
to
the
house
which
the
lodge
was
supposed
to
guard
that
open
gate
then
must
have
been
intentional
plainly
however
he
must
take
her
at
her
word
and
as
he
tramped
down
the
drive
he
began
to
form
theories
it
must
be
a
fanatic
of
some
kind
who
lived
here
and
he
inclined
to
consider
the
owner
as
probably
an
eccentric
old
lady
with
a
fad
and
a
large
number
of
as
he
came
nearer
through
the
trees
he
became
still
more
astonished
for
as
the
branches
thinned
he
became
aware
of
lights
burning
at
such
enormous
distances
apart
that
the
building
seemed
more
like
a
village
than
a
house
straight
before
him
shone
a
row
of
lighted
squares
high
up
as
if
hung
in
air
receding
in
perspective
till
blocked
out
by
a
black
mass
which
seemed
a
roof
of
some
kind
far
on
the
left
shone
some
kind
of
illuminated
gateway
and
to
his
right
another
window
or
two
glimmered
almost
beneath
his
feet
another
fifty
yards
down
the
winding
drive
disclosed
a
sight
that
made
him
seriously
wonder
whether
the
whole
experience
were
real
for
now
only
a
few
steps
further
on
and
still
lower
than
the
level
at
which
he
was
stood
apparently
a
porter
lodge
as
of
a
great
college
there
was
a
tudor
archway
with
rooms
above
it
and
rooms
on
either
side
a
lamp
hung
from
the
roof
illuminated
the
dry
stone
pavement
within
and
huge
barred
gates
at
the
further
end
shut
off
all
other
view
it
looked
like
the
entrance
to
some
vast
feudal
castle
and
he
thought
again
that
if
an
eccentric
old
lady
lived
here
she
must
be
very
eccentric
indeed
he
began
to
wonder
whether
a
seneschal
in
a
belt
hung
with
keys
would
presently
make
his
appearance
he
considered
whether
or
not
he
could
wind
a
horn
if
there
were
no
other
way
of
summoning
the
retainers
when
at
last
he
tapped
at
a
small
interior
door
also
studded
and
barred
with
iron
and
the
door
opened
the
figure
he
did
see
was
hardly
less
of
a
shock
to
him
than
a
seneschal
would
have
been
for
there
stood
as
if
straight
out
of
a
christmas
number
the
figure
of
a
monk
tall
lean
with
gray
hair
with
a
pair
of
merry
eyes
and
a
brisk
manner
he
wore
a
broad
leather
band
round
his
black
frock
and
carried
his
spare
hand
thrust
deep
into
it
ii
the
monk
sighed
humorously
another
of
them
he
said
well
my
man
please
father
the
monk
closed
his
eyes
as
in
resignation
you
need
try
that
on
he
said
besides
i
not
a
father
i
a
brother
can
you
remember
that
frank
smiled
back
very
well
brother
i
a
catholic
myself
ah
yes
sighed
the
monk
briskly
that
what
they
all
say
can
you
say
the
praises
do
you
know
what
they
are
however
that
makes
no
difference
as
but
i
can
brother
be
god
blessed
be
his
but
you
not
irish
i
know
i
not
but
are
you
an
educated
man
however
that
not
my
affair
what
can
i
do
for
you
sir
the
monk
seemed
to
take
a
little
more
interest
in
him
and
frank
took
courage
yes
he
said
i
an
educated
man
my
name
frank
gregory
i
got
two
friends
out
on
the
road
up
there
a
man
and
a
woman
their
trustcott
and
the
woman
no
good
no
good
said
the
monk
no
women
but
brother
she
really
ca
go
any
further
i
very
sorry
but
we
simply
must
have
shelter
we
got
two
or
three
shillings
if
necessary
oh
you
have
have
you
said
the
monk
keenly
that
quite
new
and
when
did
you
touch
food
last
yesterday
morning
do
say
me
it
not
necessary
we
last
touched
food
about
twelve
we
had
beans
and
cold
bacon
said
frank
deliberately
we
perfectly
willing
to
pay
for
shelter
and
food
if
we
obliged
but
of
course
we
do
want
to
the
monk
eyed
him
very
keenly
indeed
a
minute
or
two
without
speaking
this
seemed
a
new
type
come
in
and
sit
down
a
minute
he
said
i
fetch
the
it
was
a
very
plain
little
room
in
which
frank
sat
and
seemed
designed
on
purpose
to
furnish
no
temptation
to
pilferers
there
was
a
table
two
chairs
a
painted
plaster
statue
of
a
man
in
black
standing
on
a
small
bracket
with
a
crook
in
his
hand
a
pious
book
much
lay
face
downwards
on
the
table
beside
the
oil
lamp
there
was
another
door
through
which
the
monk
had
disappeared
and
that
was
absolutely
all
there
was
no
carpet
and
no
curtains
but
a
bright
little
coal
fire
burned
on
the
hearth
and
two
windows
looked
one
up
the
drive
down
which
frank
had
come
and
the
other
into
some
sort
of
courtyard
on
the
opposite
side
about
ten
minutes
passed
away
without
anything
at
all
happening
frank
heard
more
than
one
gust
of
wind
dash
against
the
little
barred
window
to
the
south
and
he
wondered
how
his
friends
were
getting
on
the
major
at
any
rate
he
knew
would
manage
to
keep
himself
tolerably
dry
then
he
began
to
think
about
this
place
and
was
surprised
that
he
was
not
surprised
at
running
into
it
like
this
in
the
dark
he
knew
nothing
at
all
about
monasteries
he
hardly
knew
that
there
were
such
things
in
england
one
must
remember
that
he
had
only
been
a
catholic
for
about
five
months
and
yet
somehow
now
that
he
had
come
here
it
all
seemed
inevitable
i
can
not
put
it
better
than
that
it
is
what
he
himself
says
in
his
diary
then
as
he
meditated
the
door
opened
and
there
came
in
a
thin
elderly
man
dressed
like
the
brother
who
followed
him
except
that
over
his
frock
he
wore
a
broad
strip
of
black
stuff
something
like
a
long
loose
apron
hanging
from
his
throat
to
his
feet
and
his
head
was
enveloped
in
a
black
hood
frank
stood
up
and
bowed
with
some
difficulty
he
was
beginning
to
feel
stiff
well
said
the
priest
sharply
with
his
bright
gray
eyes
puckered
at
the
corners
running
over
and
taking
in
the
whole
of
frank
figure
from
hair
to
earthy
boots
brother
james
tells
me
you
wish
to
see
me
it
was
brother
james
who
said
so
father
said
frank
what
is
it
you
want
i
got
two
friends
on
the
road
who
want
shelter
man
and
woman
pay
if
necessary
but
never
mind
about
that
interrupted
the
priest
sharply
who
are
you
the
name
i
go
by
is
frank
gregory
the
name
you
go
by
eh
where
were
you
educated
eton
and
cambridge
how
do
you
come
to
be
on
the
roads
that
a
long
story
father
did
you
do
anything
you
should
no
but
i
been
in
prison
since
and
your
name
frank
gregory
eh
frank
turned
as
if
to
leave
he
understood
that
he
was
known
well
father
the
priest
turned
with
upraised
hand
brother
james
just
step
outside
then
he
continued
as
the
door
closed
you
need
go
er
gregory
your
name
shall
not
be
mentioned
to
a
living
being
without
your
leave
you
know
about
me
of
course
i
do
now
be
sensible
my
dear
fellow
go
and
fetch
your
friends
we
manage
somehow
he
raised
his
voice
and
rapped
on
the
table
brother
james
go
up
with
gregory
to
the
porter
lodge
make
arrangements
to
put
the
woman
up
somewhere
either
there
or
in
a
gardener
cottage
then
bring
the
man
down
here
his
name
trustcott
said
frank
and
when
you
come
back
i
shall
be
waiting
for
you
here
iii
frank
states
in
his
diary
that
an
extraordinary
sense
of
familiarity
descended
on
him
as
half
an
hour
later
the
door
of
a
cell
closed
behind
dom
hildebrand
maple
and
he
found
himself
in
a
room
with
a
bright
fire
burning
a
suit
of
clothes
waiting
for
him
a
can
of
hot
water
a
sponging
tin
and
a
small
iron
bed
i
think
i
understand
what
he
means
somehow
or
other
a
monastery
represents
the
least
common
multiple
of
nearly
all
pleasant
houses
it
has
the
largeness
and
amplitude
of
a
castle
and
the
plainness
of
decent
poverty
it
has
none
of
that
theatricality
which
it
is
supposed
to
have
none
of
the
dreaminess
or
the
sentimentality
with
which
protestants
endow
it
he
had
passed
just
now
through
first
a
network
of
small
stairways
archways
vestibules
and
passages
and
then
along
two
immense
corridors
with
windows
on
one
side
and
closed
doors
on
the
other
everywhere
there
was
the
same
quiet
warmth
and
decency
and
plainness
stained
deal
uncarpeted
boards
a
few
oil
pictures
in
the
lower
corridor
an
image
or
two
at
the
turn
and
head
of
the
stairs
it
was
lighted
clearly
and
unaffectedly
by
incandescent
gas
and
the
only
figures
he
had
seen
were
of
two
or
three
monks
with
hooded
heads
they
had
raised
these
hoods
slightly
in
salutation
as
he
passed
each
going
about
his
business
briskly
and
silently
there
was
even
a
cheerful
smell
of
cooking
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
corridors
and
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
two
or
three
aproned
lay
brothers
busy
in
the
firelight
and
glow
of
a
huge
kitchen
over
great
copper
pans
the
sense
of
familiarity
then
is
perfectly
intelligible
a
visitor
to
a
monastery
steps
indeed
into
a
busy
and
life
but
there
is
enough
room
and
air
and
silence
for
him
to
preserve
his
individuality
too
as
soon
as
he
was
washed
and
dressed
he
sat
down
in
a
chair
before
the
fire
but
almost
immediately
there
came
a
tap
on
his
door
and
the
somewhat
inflamed
face
of
the
major
looked
in
frankie
he
whispered
and
reassured
came
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
he
looked
very
curiously
small
and
unimportant
thought
frank
perhaps
it
was
the
black
suit
that
had
been
lent
him
by
gad
frankie
we
in
clover
he
whispered
still
apparently
under
the
impression
that
somehow
he
was
in
church
there
are
some
other
chaps
you
know
off
the
roads
too
but
they
down
by
the
lodge
somewhere
he
broke
off
and
then
continued
i
got
such
a
queer
johnnie
in
my
room
ah
you
got
one
too
he
went
up
to
examine
a
small
plaster
statue
of
a
saint
above
the
it
all
right
is
it
said
frank
sleepily
and
there
another
johnnie
name
on
the
door
the
rev
augustine
or
something
he
back
to
the
fire
lifted
his
tails
and
stood
warming
himself
with
a
complacent
but
nervous
smile
frank
regarded
him
with
wonder
what
do
all
the
johnnies
do
here
asked
the
major
presently
have
a
rare
old
time
i
expect
i
bet
they
got
cellars
under
here
all
right
just
like
those
chaps
in
comic
pictures
ai
it
frank
decided
it
was
no
use
to
try
to
explain
the
major
babbled
on
a
minute
or
two
longer
requiring
no
answer
and
every
now
and
then
having
his
roving
eye
caught
by
some
new
marvel
he
fingered
a
sprig
of
yew
that
was
twisted
into
a
crucifix
hung
over
the
bed
expect
it
one
of
those
old
relics
he
said
some
lie
or
other
he
humorously
dressed
up
the
statue
of
the
saint
in
a
and
said
let
us
pray
in
a
loud
whisper
with
one
eye
on
the
door
and
all
the
while
there
still
lay
on
him
apparently
the
impression
that
if
he
talked
loud
or
made
any
perceptible
sound
he
would
be
turned
out
again
he
was
just
beginning
a
few
steps
of
a
noiseless
dance
when
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
he
collapsed
into
an
attitude
of
humility
dom
hildebrand
came
in
if
you
ready
he
said
we
might
go
down
to
supper
frank
relates
in
his
diary
that
of
all
else
in
the
monastery
apart
from
the
church
the
refectory
and
its
manners
impressed
him
most
how
easy
it
is
to
picture
it
when
one
has
once
seen
the
ceremonies
he
sat
at
a
center
table
with
the
major
opposite
looking
smaller
than
ever
before
a
cloth
laid
with
knife
spoon
and
forks
all
round
the
walls
on
a
low
da√Øs
with
their
backs
against
them
sat
a
row
of
perhaps
forty
monks
of
every
age
kind
and
condition
the
tables
were
bare
wood
laid
simply
with
utensils
and
no
cloths
with
a
napkin
in
each
place
at
the
end
opposite
the
door
there
sat
at
a
table
all
alone
a
big
portly
man
of
a
startlingly
fatherly
appearance
and
with
fine
features
this
was
the
abbot
above
him
hung
a
crucifix
with
the
single
word
beneath
it
on
a
small
black
label
the
meal
began
however
with
the
ceremony
of
singing
grace
the
rows
of
monks
stood
out
with
one
in
the
middle
facing
the
abbot
each
with
his
hood
forward
and
his
hands
hidden
in
his
scapular
it
was
sung
to
a
grave
tone
with
sudden
intonations
by
the
united
voices
in
unison
blessing
response
collect
psalm
and
the
rest
frank
could
not
resist
one
glance
at
the
major
whose
face
of
consternation
resembled
that
of
a
bird
in
the
company
of
sedate
cats
then
each
went
to
his
place
and
noiselessly
the
orderly
meal
began
and
continued
to
the
reading
first
of
the
gospel
and
then
of
a
history
from
a
pulpit
built
high
in
the
wall
all
were
served
by
lay
brothers
girded
with
aprons
almost
every
movement
though
entirely
natural
seemed
ordered
by
routine
and
custom
and
was
distinguished
by
a
serious
sort
of
courtesy
that
made
the
taking
of
food
appear
for
once
as
a
really
beautiful
august
and
almost
sacramental
ceremony
the
great
hall
too
with
its
pointed
roof
its
tiled
floor
its
scrubbed
tables
and
its
tall
emblazoned
windows
seemed
exactly
the
proper
background
a
kind
of
secular
sanctuary
the
food
was
plain
and
plentiful
soup
meat
cheese
and
fruit
and
each
of
the
two
guests
had
a
small
decanter
of
red
wine
a
tiny
loaf
of
bread
and
a
napkin
the
monks
drank
beer
or
water
then
once
more
followed
grace
with
the
same
ceremonial
when
this
was
ended
frank
turned
to
see
where
father
hildebrand
was
supposing
that
all
would
go
to
their
rooms
but
as
he
turned
he
saw
the
abbot
coming
down
alone
he
moved
on
this
great
man
with
that
same
large
fatherly
air
but
as
he
passed
the
two
guests
he
inclined
slightly
towards
them
and
frank
with
a
glance
to
warn
the
major
understanding
that
they
were
to
follow
came
out
of
his
place
and
passed
down
between
the
lines
of
the
monks
still
in
silence
the
abbot
went
on
turned
to
the
right
and
as
he
moved
along
the
cloister
loud
sonorous
chanting
began
behind
so
they
went
on
and
on
up
the
long
lighted
corridor
past
door
after
door
as
in
some
church
procession
yet
all
was
obviously
natural
and
familiar
they
turned
in
at
last
beneath
an
archway
to
the
left
went
through
a
vestibule
past
a
great
stone
of
a
crowned
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arms
and
as
they
entered
the
church
the
abbot
dipped
his
finger
into
a
stoop
and
presented
it
to
frank
frank
touched
the
drop
of
water
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
presented
again
his
damp
finger
to
the
major
who
looked
at
him
with
a
startled
eye
the
abbot
indicated
the
front
row
of
the
seats
in
the
nave
and
frank
went
into
it
to
watch
the
procession
behind
go
past
flow
up
the
steps
and
disappear
into
the
double
rows
of
great
stalls
that
lined
the
choir
there
was
still
silence
and
longer
silence
till
frank
understood
iv
his
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
gloom
little
by
little
and
he
began
to
be
able
to
make
out
the
magnificence
of
the
place
he
was
in
behind
him
stretched
the
immense
nave
its
roof
and
columns
lost
in
darkness
its
sides
faintly
illuminated
by
the
glimmer
of
single
each
in
a
small
chapel
but
in
front
of
him
was
the
greater
splendor
from
side
to
side
across
the
entrance
to
the
choir
ran
the
a
vast
erection
of
brown
oak
and
black
iron
surmounted
by
a
high
loft
from
which
glimmered
down
sheaves
of
silvered
organ
pipes
and
higher
yet
in
deep
shadow
he
could
make
out
three
gigantic
figures
of
which
the
center
one
was
nailed
to
a
cross
beyond
this
began
the
stalls
dark
and
majestic
broken
by
carving
jutting
heads
of
kings
and
priests
leaning
forward
as
if
to
breathe
in
the
magnetism
of
that
immense
living
silence
generated
by
forty
men
at
their
prayers
at
the
further
end
there
shone
out
faintly
the
glory
of
the
high
altar
almost
luminous
it
seemed
in
the
light
of
the
single
red
spark
that
hung
before
it
frank
could
discern
presently
the
gilded
figures
that
stood
among
the
candlesticks
behind
the
throne
and
crucifix
the
mysterious
veiling
curtains
of
the
tabernacle
finally
in
the
midst
of
the
choir
stood
a
tall
erection
which
he
could
not
understand
an
extraordinary
peace
seemed
to
descend
and
envelop
him
as
he
looked
a
kind
of
crown
and
climax
of
various
interior
experiences
that
were
falling
on
him
now
for
the
last
few
weeks
it
is
useless
trying
to
put
it
into
words
i
shall
hope
to
do
my
best
presently
by
quoting
frank
himself
there
was
a
sense
of
there
was
a
sense
of
astonishing
sanity
there
was
a
sense
of
an
enormous
objective
peace
meeting
and
ratifying
that
interior
peace
which
was
beginning
to
be
his
it
appeared
to
him
somehow
as
if
for
the
first
time
he
experienced
without
him
that
which
up
to
now
he
had
chiefly
found
within
certainly
there
had
been
moments
of
this
before
not
merely
emotional
you
understand
when
heart
and
head
lay
still
from
their
striving
and
the
will
reposed
in
another
will
but
this
was
the
climax
it
summed
up
all
that
he
had
learned
in
the
last
few
months
it
soothed
the
last
scars
away
it
explained
and
answered
and
above
all
correlated
his
experiences
no
doubt
it
was
the
physical
as
well
as
the
spiritual
atmosphere
of
this
place
the
quiet
corridors
the
warmth
and
the
plainness
and
the
solidity
even
the
august
grace
of
the
refectory
all
these
helped
and
had
part
in
the
sensation
yet
if
it
is
possible
for
you
to
believe
it
these
were
no
more
than
the
vessels
from
which
the
heavenly
fluid
streamed
vessels
rather
that
contained
a
little
of
that
abundance
that
surged
up
here
as
in
a
fountain
frank
started
a
little
at
a
voice
in
his
ear
when
it
going
to
begin
whispered
the
major
in
a
hoarse
apprehensive
voice
v
a
figure
detached
itself
presently
from
the
dark
mass
of
the
stalls
and
came
down
to
where
they
were
sitting
frank
perceived
it
was
father
hildebrand
we
singing
mattins
of
the
dead
presently
he
said
in
a
low
voice
it
all
souls
eve
will
you
stay
or
shall
i
take
you
to
your
room
the
major
stood
up
with
alacrity
i
stay
if
i
may
said
frank
very
well
then
i
take
trustcott
upstairs
half
an
hour
later
the
ceremony
began
here
i
simply
despair
of
description
i
know
something
of
what
frank
witnessed
and
perceived
for
i
have
been
present
myself
at
this
affair
in
a
religious
house
but
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
able
to
write
it
down
first
however
there
was
the
external
visible
audible
service
the
catafalque
a
erection
all
black
and
yellow
guarded
by
yellow
flames
on
yellow
candles
the
grave
movements
the
almost
monstrous
figures
the
rhythm
of
the
ceremonies
and
the
wail
of
the
music
of
forty
voices
singing
as
one
all
that
is
understood
but
the
inner
side
of
these
things
the
reverse
of
which
these
things
are
but
a
coarse
lining
the
substance
of
which
this
is
a
shadow
that
is
what
passes
words
and
transcends
impressions
it
seemed
to
frank
that
one
section
at
any
rate
of
that
enormous
truth
at
which
he
had
clutched
almost
blindly
when
he
had
first
made
his
submission
to
the
church
one
chamber
in
that
house
of
life
was
now
flung
open
before
him
and
he
saw
in
it
men
as
trees
walking
he
was
tired
and
excited
of
course
he
was
intensely
imaginative
but
there
are
some
experiences
that
a
rise
of
temperature
can
not
explain
and
that
an
imagination
can
not
originate
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
here
he
was
aware
of
an
immeasurable
need
to
which
those
ministrations
were
addressed
and
this
whole
was
countless
in
its
units
and
clamant
in
its
silence
it
was
as
a
man
might
see
the
wall
of
his
room
roll
away
beyond
which
he
had
thought
only
the
night
to
lie
and
discern
a
thronging
mass
of
faces
crying
for
help
pressing
upon
him
urging
yet
all
without
sound
or
word
he
attempts
in
his
diary
to
use
phrases
for
all
this
he
speaks
of
a
pit
in
which
is
no
water
of
shadows
and
forms
that
writhe
and
plead
of
a
light
of
glass
mingled
with
fire
and
yet
of
an
inevitability
of
a
justice
which
there
is
no
questioning
and
a
force
that
there
is
no
resisting
and
on
the
other
side
there
was
this
help
given
by
men
of
flesh
and
blood
like
himself
using
ceremonies
and
gestures
and
strange
resonant
words
the
whole
was
as
some
enormous
orchestra
there
was
the
wail
on
this
side
the
answer
on
that
the
throb
of
beating
hearts
there
were
climaxes
catastrophes
soft
passages
and
yet
the
result
was
one
vast
and
harmonious
whole
it
was
the
catafalque
that
seemed
to
him
the
veiled
door
to
that
other
world
that
so
manifested
itself
seen
as
he
saw
it
in
the
light
of
the
yellow
candles
it
was
as
the
awful
portal
of
death
itself
beneath
that
heavy
mantle
lay
not
so
much
a
body
of
humanity
still
in
death
as
a
soul
of
humanity
alive
beyond
death
quick
and
yet
motionless
with
pain
and
those
figures
that
moved
about
it
with
censor
and
aspersorium
were
as
angels
for
tenderness
and
dignity
and
undoubted
power
they
were
men
like
himself
yet
they
were
far
more
and
they
too
one
day
like
himself
would
pass
beneath
that
pall
and
need
the
help
of
others
that
should
follow
them
something
of
this
is
but
a
hint
of
what
frank
experienced
it
came
and
went
no
doubt
in
gusts
yet
all
through
he
seems
to
have
felt
that
sense
that
here
was
a
door
into
that
great
watching
world
beyond
that
here
in
what
is
supposed
by
the
world
to
be
the
narrow
constraint
of
religion
was
a
liberty
and
an
outlook
into
realities
such
as
the
open
road
and
nature
can
but
seldom
give
but
for
my
part
i
can
no
more
follow
him
further
than
i
can
write
down
the
passion
of
the
lover
and
the
ecstasy
of
the
musician
if
these
things
could
be
said
in
words
they
would
have
been
said
long
ago
but
at
least
it
was
along
this
path
of
perception
that
frank
went
a
path
that
but
continued
the
way
along
which
he
had
come
with
such
sure
swiftness
ever
since
the
moment
he
had
taken
his
sorrows
and
changed
them
from
bitter
to
sweet
some
sentences
that
he
has
written
mean
nothing
to
me
at
all
only
this
i
see
clearly
both
from
my
talks
with
father
hildebrand
and
from
the
diary
which
frank
amplified
at
his
bidding
that
frank
had
reached
the
end
of
a
second
stage
in
his
journey
and
that
a
third
was
to
begin
it
is
significant
also
i
think
in
view
of
what
is
to
follow
that
the
last
initiation
of
this
stage
should
have
taken
place
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
chapter
v
i
there
are
certain
moods
into
which
minds
very
much
tired
or
very
much
concentrated
occasionally
fall
in
which
the
most
trifling
things
take
on
them
an
appearance
of
great
significance
a
man
in
great
anxiety
for
example
will
regard
as
omens
or
warnings
such
things
as
the
ringing
of
a
bell
or
the
flight
of
a
bird
i
have
heard
this
process
deliberately
defended
by
people
who
should
know
better
i
have
heard
it
said
that
those
moods
of
intense
concentration
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
states
of
soul
in
which
the
intuitive
or
mystical
faculties
work
with
great
facility
and
that
at
such
times
connections
and
correlations
are
perceived
which
at
other
times
pass
unnoticed
the
events
of
the
world
then
are
by
such
people
regarded
as
forming
links
in
a
chain
of
purpose
events
even
which
are
obviously
to
the
practical
man
merely
the
effects
of
chance
and
accident
it
is
utterly
impossible
says
the
practical
man
that
the
ringing
of
a
bell
or
the
grouping
of
or
the
particular
moment
at
which
a
picture
falls
from
a
wall
can
be
anything
but
fortuitous
and
it
is
the
sign
of
a
weak
and
superstitious
mind
to
regard
them
as
anything
else
there
can
be
no
purpose
or
sequence
except
in
matters
where
we
can
perceive
purpose
or
sequence
of
course
the
practical
man
must
be
right
we
imply
that
he
is
right
since
we
call
him
practical
and
i
have
to
deplore
therefore
the
fact
that
frank
on
several
occasions
fell
into
a
superstitious
way
of
looking
at
things
the
proof
is
only
too
plain
from
his
own
diary
not
that
he
interprets
the
little
events
which
he
records
but
that
he
takes
such
extreme
pains
to
write
them
down
events
too
that
are
to
all
people
almost
glaringly
unimportant
and
insignificant
i
have
two
such
incidents
to
record
between
the
the
travelers
leaving
the
benedictine
monastery
and
their
arriving
in
london
in
december
the
major
and
gertie
have
probably
long
since
forgotten
the
one
which
they
themselves
witnessed
and
indeed
there
is
no
particular
reason
why
they
should
remember
it
of
the
other
frank
seems
to
have
said
nothing
to
his
friends
both
of
them
however
are
perfectly
insignificant
they
concern
respectively
only
a
few
invisible
singers
and
a
couple
of
quite
ordinary
human
beings
they
are
described
with
a
wholly
unnecessary
wealth
of
detail
in
frank
diary
though
without
comment
and
i
write
them
down
here
for
that
reason
and
that
reason
only
the
first
was
as
follows
they
were
approaching
a
certain
cathedral
town
not
a
hundred
miles
from
london
and
as
the
evening
was
clear
and
dry
though
frosty
and
money
was
low
they
determined
to
pass
the
night
in
a
convenient
about
half
a
mile
out
of
the
town
there
was
a
handy
shed
where
various
implements
were
kept
the
major
by
the
help
of
a
little
twisted
wire
easily
unfastened
the
door
they
supped
cooking
a
little
porridge
over
a
small
fire
which
they
were
able
to
make
without
risk
and
lay
down
to
sleep
after
a
pipe
or
two
tramps
go
to
sleep
early
when
they
mean
business
and
it
could
not
have
been
more
than
about
eleven
at
night
when
frank
awoke
with
the
sense
that
he
had
slept
long
and
deeply
he
seems
to
have
lain
there
content
and
quiet
enough
watching
the
last
ember
dying
in
the
brazier
where
they
had
made
their
fire
there
was
presently
a
stir
from
the
further
corner
of
the
shed
a
match
was
struck
and
frank
from
his
improvised
pillow
beheld
the
major
face
suddenly
illuminated
by
the
light
with
which
he
was
kindling
his
pipe
once
more
he
watched
the
face
with
a
sort
of
artistic
interest
for
a
few
seconds
the
drooping
shadows
the
apparently
cavernous
eyes
the
bar
of
the
mustache
across
the
face
in
the
wavering
light
cast
from
below
it
resembled
the
face
of
a
vindictive
beast
then
the
major
whispered
between
his
puffs
frankie
yes
oh
you
awake
too
are
you
yes
a
minute
later
though
they
had
spoken
only
in
whispers
gertie
drew
a
long
sighing
breath
from
her
corner
of
the
shed
and
they
could
hear
that
she
too
sat
up
and
cleared
her
throat
well
this
is
a
pretty
job
said
the
major
jovially
to
the
company
generally
what
the
matter
with
us
frank
said
nothing
he
lay
still
with
a
sense
of
extraordinary
content
and
comfort
and
heard
gertie
presently
lie
down
again
the
major
smoked
steadily
then
the
singing
began
it
was
a
perfectly
still
night
and
motionless
it
was
late
enough
for
the
sounds
of
the
town
to
have
died
away
cathedral
towns
go
to
bed
early
and
rise
late
and
indeed
almost
the
only
sounds
they
had
heard
even
three
or
four
hours
before
had
been
the
occasional
deliberate
chime
of
bells
like
a
meditative
man
suddenly
uttering
a
word
or
two
aloud
now
however
everything
was
dead
silent
probably
the
hour
had
struck
immediately
before
they
awoke
since
frank
remarks
that
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
four
notes
tolled
out
the
quarter
the
singing
came
first
as
a
sensation
rather
than
as
a
sound
so
far
away
was
it
it
was
not
at
once
that
frank
formulated
the
sense
of
pleasure
that
he
experienced
by
telling
himself
that
someone
was
singing
at
first
it
was
a
single
voice
that
made
itself
heard
a
tenor
of
extraordinary
clarity
the
air
was
unknown
to
him
but
it
had
the
character
of
antiquity
there
was
a
certain
pleasant
melancholy
about
it
it
contained
little
trills
and
such
as
before
harmony
developed
in
the
modern
sense
probably
supplied
the
absence
of
chords
there
was
no
wind
on
which
the
sound
could
rise
or
fall
and
it
grew
from
a
thread
out
of
the
distance
into
clear
singing
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
the
major
presently
grunted
over
his
pipe
some
expression
of
surprise
but
frank
could
say
nothing
he
was
almost
holding
his
breath
so
great
was
his
pleasure
the
air
almost
regretfully
ran
downhill
like
a
brook
approaching
an
inevitable
full
close
and
then
as
the
last
note
was
reached
a
chord
of
voices
broke
in
with
some
kind
of
chorus
the
voices
were
of
a
quartette
of
men
and
rang
together
like
struck
notes
not
loud
or
harsh
but
on
the
contrary
with
a
restrained
softness
that
must
i
suppose
have
been
the
result
of
very
careful
training
it
was
the
same
air
that
they
were
repeating
but
the
were
absent
and
the
four
voices
in
chord
after
chord
supplied
their
place
by
harmony
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
was
the
subject
of
the
song
or
even
whether
it
were
sacred
or
secular
for
it
was
of
that
period
at
least
so
i
conjecture
when
the
two
worlds
were
one
and
when
men
courted
their
love
and
adored
their
god
after
the
same
fashion
only
there
ran
through
all
that
air
of
sweet
and
austere
melancholy
as
if
earthly
music
could
do
no
more
than
hint
at
what
the
heart
wished
to
express
frank
listened
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
the
music
was
nearer
now
coming
from
the
direction
from
which
the
three
travelers
had
themselves
come
this
afternoon
presently
from
the
apparent
diminuendo
it
was
plain
that
the
singers
were
past
and
were
going
on
towards
the
town
there
was
no
sound
of
footsteps
the
major
remarked
on
that
when
he
could
get
frank
to
attend
a
few
minutes
later
when
all
was
over
but
there
were
field
paths
running
in
every
direction
as
well
as
broad
stretches
of
grass
beside
the
road
so
the
singers
may
very
well
have
been
walking
on
soft
ground
these
points
are
dispassionately
noted
down
in
the
diary
the
chorus
was
growing
fainter
now
once
more
the
last
slopes
of
the
melody
were
in
sight
those
downhill
gradations
of
the
air
that
told
of
the
silence
to
come
then
once
more
for
an
instant
there
was
silence
till
again
perhaps
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
the
single
tenor
voice
began
and
the
last
that
frank
heard
at
the
moment
before
the
quarter
struck
and
soft
and
mellow
though
it
was
jarred
the
air
and
left
the
ear
unable
to
focus
itself
again
on
the
tiny
woven
thread
of
sound
was
once
more
the
untiring
quartette
taking
up
the
melody
far
off
in
the
silent
darkness
it
seems
to
me
a
curious
little
incident
this
passing
of
four
singers
in
the
night
it
might
have
seemed
as
if
our
travelers
by
a
kind
of
chance
were
allowed
to
overhear
the
affairs
of
a
world
other
than
their
own
and
the
more
curious
because
frank
seems
to
have
been
so
much
absorbed
by
it
of
course
from
a
practical
point
of
view
it
is
almost
painfully
obvious
what
is
the
explanation
it
must
have
been
a
quartette
from
the
cathedral
choir
returning
from
some
festivity
in
the
suburbs
and
it
must
have
happened
that
they
followed
the
same
route
though
walking
on
the
grass
along
which
frank
himself
had
come
that
evening
ii
the
second
incident
is
even
more
ordinary
and
once
again
i
must
declare
that
nothing
would
have
induced
me
to
incorporate
it
into
this
story
had
it
not
appeared
described
very
minutely
in
the
sort
of
into
which
frank
diary
occasionally
degenerates
they
were
within
a
very
few
miles
of
the
outskirts
of
london
and
december
had
succeeded
november
they
had
had
a
day
or
two
of
work
upon
some
farm
or
other
i
have
not
been
able
to
identify
the
place
and
had
run
into
and
indeed
exchanged
remarks
with
two
or
three
groups
of
tramps
also
london
bound
they
were
given
temporary
lodgings
in
a
loft
over
a
stable
by
the
farmer
for
whom
they
worked
and
this
stable
was
situated
in
a
court
at
the
end
of
the
village
street
with
gates
that
stood
open
all
day
since
the
yard
was
overlooked
by
the
windows
of
the
and
besides
there
was
really
nothing
to
steal
they
had
finished
their
work
in
the
fields
i
think
it
had
to
do
with
the
sheep
and
or
something
of
the
kind
they
had
returned
to
their
lodgings
received
their
pay
packed
up
their
belongings
and
had
already
reached
the
further
end
of
the
village
on
their
way
to
london
when
frank
discovered
that
he
had
left
a
pair
of
socks
behind
this
would
never
do
socks
cost
money
and
their
absence
meant
sore
feet
and
weariness
so
he
told
the
major
and
gertie
to
walk
on
slowly
while
he
went
back
he
would
catch
them
up
he
said
before
they
had
gone
half
a
mile
he
hid
his
bundle
under
a
hedge
every
pound
of
weight
made
a
difference
at
the
end
of
a
day
work
and
set
off
it
was
just
at
that
moment
between
day
and
night
between
four
and
five
as
he
came
back
into
the
yard
he
went
straight
through
the
open
gates
glancing
about
to
explain
matters
to
the
farmer
if
necessary
but
not
seeing
him
went
up
the
rickety
stairs
groped
his
way
across
to
the
window
took
down
his
socks
from
the
nail
an
which
he
had
hung
them
last
night
and
came
down
again
as
he
came
into
the
yard
he
thought
he
heard
something
stirring
within
the
open
door
of
the
stable
on
his
right
and
thinking
it
to
be
the
farmer
and
that
an
explanation
would
be
advisable
looked
in
at
first
he
saw
nothing
though
he
could
hear
a
horse
moving
about
in
the
in
the
corner
then
he
saw
a
light
shine
beneath
the
crack
of
the
second
door
beside
the
that
led
into
the
proper
and
the
next
instant
the
door
opened
a
man
came
in
with
a
lantern
obviously
just
lighted
as
the
flame
was
not
yet
burned
up
and
stopped
with
a
look
on
seeing
frank
but
he
said
nothing
frank
himself
was
just
on
the
point
of
giving
an
explanation
when
he
too
stopped
dead
and
stared
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
here
before
under
exactly
the
same
circumstances
he
tried
to
remember
what
happened
next
but
he
could
not
for
this
was
what
he
saw
as
the
flame
burned
up
more
brightly
the
man
who
held
the
lantern
and
looked
at
him
in
silence
with
a
air
was
a
man
bearded
and
he
had
thrown
over
his
shoulders
a
piece
of
sacking
that
hung
from
him
almost
like
a
robe
the
light
that
he
carried
threw
heavy
wavering
shadows
about
the
stable
and
frank
noticed
the
great
head
of
a
in
the
peering
through
the
bars
as
if
to
inquire
what
the
company
wanted
then
still
without
speaking
frank
let
his
eyes
rove
round
and
they
stopped
suddenly
at
the
sight
of
yet
one
more
living
being
in
the
stable
next
to
the
was
a
stall
empty
except
for
one
occupant
for
there
sitting
on
a
box
with
her
back
to
the
manger
and
one
arm
flung
along
it
to
support
her
weight
was
the
figure
of
a
girl
her
head
wrapped
in
an
old
shawl
leaned
back
against
her
arm
and
a
very
white
and
weary
face
absolutely
motionless
looked
at
him
she
had
great
eyes
with
shadows
beneath
and
her
lips
were
half
opened
by
her
side
lay
a
regular
tramp
bundle
frank
looked
at
her
steadily
a
moment
then
he
looked
back
at
the
man
who
still
had
not
moved
or
spoken
the
draught
from
the
door
behind
blew
in
and
shook
the
flame
of
his
lantern
and
the
horse
sighed
long
and
loud
in
the
shadows
behind
once
more
frank
glanced
at
the
girl
she
had
lowered
her
arm
from
the
manger
and
now
sat
looking
at
him
it
seemed
with
a
curious
intentness
and
expectancy
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
frank
bowed
a
little
almost
apologetically
and
went
out
now
that
was
absolutely
all
that
happened
frank
says
so
expressly
in
his
diary
he
did
not
speak
to
them
nor
they
to
him
nor
was
any
explanation
given
on
either
side
he
went
out
across
the
yard
in
silence
seeing
nothing
of
the
farmer
but
hearing
a
piano
begin
to
play
beyond
the
brightly
lighted
windows
of
which
he
could
catch
a
glimpse
over
the
low
wall
separating
the
yard
from
the
garden
he
walked
quickly
up
the
village
street
and
caught
up
his
companions
as
he
had
said
less
than
half
a
mile
further
on
he
said
nothing
to
them
of
his
experience
indeed
what
was
there
to
say
but
he
must
have
written
it
down
that
same
night
when
they
reached
their
next
lodging
and
written
it
down
too
with
that
minuteness
of
detail
which
surprised
me
so
much
when
i
first
read
it
for
the
explanation
of
the
whole
thing
is
as
foolishly
obvious
as
was
that
of
the
singing
that
the
three
had
heard
in
the
suburbs
of
peterborough
obviously
a
couple
of
tramps
had
turned
into
this
stable
for
shelter
perhaps
the
girl
was
the
man
daughter
perhaps
his
wife
perhaps
neither
plainly
they
had
no
right
there
and
that
would
explain
the
embarrassed
silence
of
the
two
they
knew
they
were
trespassing
and
feared
to
be
turned
away
perhaps
already
they
had
been
turned
away
from
the
village
inn
but
the
girl
was
obviously
tired
out
and
the
man
had
determined
to
risk
it
that
then
was
the
whole
affair
commonplace
and
even
a
little
sordid
and
yet
frank
thought
that
it
was
worth
writing
down
chapter
vi
extract
taken
by
permission
from
a
few
pages
of
frank
diary
these
pages
were
written
with
the
encouragement
of
dom
hildebrand
maple
and
were
sent
to
him
later
at
his
own
he
told
me
a
great
many
things
that
surprised
me
for
instance
he
seemed
to
know
all
about
certain
ideas
that
i
had
had
before
i
told
him
of
them
and
said
that
i
was
not
responsible
and
he
picked
out
one
or
two
other
things
that
i
had
said
and
told
me
that
these
were
much
more
serious
i
went
to
confession
to
him
on
friday
morning
in
the
church
he
did
not
say
a
great
deal
then
but
he
asked
if
i
would
care
to
talk
to
him
afterwards
i
said
i
would
and
went
to
him
in
the
parlor
after
dinner
the
first
thing
that
happened
was
that
he
asked
me
to
tell
him
as
plainly
as
i
could
anything
that
had
happened
to
me
in
my
soul
i
mean
since
i
had
left
cambridge
so
i
tried
to
describe
it
i
said
that
at
first
things
went
pretty
well
in
my
soul
and
that
it
was
only
bodily
things
that
troubled
me
getting
fearfully
tired
and
stiff
being
uncomfortable
the
food
the
sleeping
and
so
on
then
as
soon
as
this
wore
off
i
met
the
major
and
gertie
i
was
rather
afraid
of
saying
all
that
i
felt
about
these
but
he
made
me
and
i
told
him
how
extraordinarily
i
seemed
to
hate
them
sometimes
how
i
felt
almost
sick
now
and
then
when
the
major
talked
to
me
and
told
me
stories
the
thing
that
seemed
to
torment
me
most
during
this
time
was
the
contrast
between
cambridge
and
merefield
and
the
people
there
and
the
company
of
this
pair
and
the
only
relief
was
that
i
knew
i
as
a
matter
of
fact
chuck
them
whenever
i
wanted
and
go
home
again
but
this
relief
was
taken
away
from
me
as
soon
as
i
understood
that
i
had
to
keep
with
them
and
do
my
best
somehow
to
separate
them
of
course
i
must
get
gertie
back
to
her
people
some
time
and
till
that
done
it
no
good
thinking
about
anything
else
after
a
while
however
i
think
it
was
just
before
i
got
into
trouble
with
the
police
i
began
to
see
that
i
was
a
conceited
ass
for
hating
the
major
so
much
it
was
absurd
for
me
i
said
to
put
on
airs
when
the
difference
between
him
and
me
was
just
that
he
had
been
brought
up
in
one
way
and
i
in
another
i
hated
the
things
he
did
and
said
not
because
they
were
wrong
but
because
they
were
what
i
called
form
that
was
really
the
whole
thing
then
i
saw
a
lot
more
and
it
made
me
feel
miserable
i
used
to
think
that
it
was
rather
good
of
me
to
be
kind
to
animals
and
children
but
i
began
to
see
that
it
was
simply
the
way
i
was
made
it
was
any
effort
to
me
i
simply
red
when
i
came
across
cruelty
and
i
saw
that
that
was
no
good
then
i
began
to
see
that
i
had
done
absolutely
nothing
of
any
good
whatever
that
nothing
had
cost
me
anything
and
that
the
things
i
was
proud
of
were
simply
my
leaving
cambridge
and
all
the
rest
they
were
theatrical
or
romantic
or
egotistical
there
was
no
real
sacrifice
i
should
have
minded
much
more
not
doing
them
i
began
to
feel
extraordinarily
small
then
the
whole
series
of
things
began
that
simply
smashed
me
up
first
there
was
the
prison
business
that
came
about
in
this
way
i
had
just
begun
to
see
that
i
was
all
wrong
with
the
major
that
by
giving
way
to
my
feelings
about
him
i
do
mean
that
i
ever
showed
it
but
that
was
only
because
i
thought
it
more
dignified
not
to
i
was
getting
all
wrong
with
regard
to
both
him
and
myself
and
that
i
must
do
something
that
my
whole
soul
hated
if
it
was
to
be
of
any
use
then
there
came
that
minute
in
the
barn
when
i
heard
the
police
were
after
us
and
that
there
was
really
no
hope
of
escape
the
particular
thing
that
settled
me
was
gertie
i
knew
somehow
that
i
could
let
the
major
go
to
prison
while
she
was
about
and
then
i
saw
that
this
was
just
the
very
thing
to
do
and
that
i
could
be
proud
of
it
ever
because
the
whole
thing
was
so
mean
and
well
i
did
it
and
it
did
me
a
lot
of
good
somehow
i
felt
really
rolled
in
the
dirt
and
that
little
thing
in
the
afterwards
rubbed
it
in
i
saw
how
i
must
be
of
conceit
really
to
mind
that
as
i
did
and
to
show
off
and
talk
like
a
gentleman
then
there
came
the
priest
who
refused
to
help
me
that
made
me
for
a
time
perfectly
furious
because
i
had
always
said
to
myself
that
catholics
and
especially
priests
would
always
understand
but
before
i
got
to
york
i
saw
what
an
ass
i
had
made
of
myself
of
course
the
priest
was
perfectly
right
i
saw
that
before
i
got
ten
yards
away
though
i
would
acknowledge
it
for
another
five
miles
i
was
a
dirty
tramp
and
i
talked
like
a
brazen
fool
i
remember
thinking
my
to
him
rather
fine
and
manly
well
that
made
me
smaller
still
then
a
sort
of
despair
came
on
me
when
the
police
got
me
turned
out
of
my
work
in
york
i
know
it
was
only
a
little
thing
though
i
still
think
it
unfair
but
it
was
like
a
pebble
in
your
boot
when
already
going
lame
from
something
else
and
then
came
jenny
letter
i
want
to
write
about
that
rather
carefully
i
said
just
now
that
i
was
getting
to
feel
smaller
and
smaller
perfectly
true
but
there
was
still
a
little
hard
lump
in
the
middle
that
would
not
break
things
might
have
gone
crumbling
away
at
me
for
ever
and
i
might
have
got
smaller
still
but
they
would
have
smashed
me
now
there
were
two
things
that
i
held
on
to
all
this
time
my
religion
and
jenny
i
gave
them
turns
so
to
speak
though
jenny
was
never
absent
when
everything
religious
tasted
flat
and
dull
and
empty
i
thought
about
jenny
when
things
were
better
when
i
had
those
two
or
three
times
i
told
father
hildebrand
about
i
still
thought
of
jenny
and
imagined
how
splendid
it
would
be
when
we
were
both
catholics
together
and
married
but
i
never
dreamed
that
jenny
would
ever
be
angry
or
disappointed
i
would
talk
about
her
to
anybody
ever
because
i
was
so
absolutely
certain
of
her
i
knew
i
thought
that
the
whole
world
might
crumble
away
but
that
jenny
would
always
understand
down
at
the
bottom
and
that
she
and
i
would
remain
well
then
came
her
letter
honestly
i
do
quite
know
what
i
was
doing
inside
for
the
next
week
or
so
simply
everything
was
altered
i
never
had
any
sort
of
doubt
that
she
meant
what
she
said
and
it
was
as
if
there
was
any
sun
or
moon
or
sky
it
was
like
being
ill
things
happened
round
me
i
ate
and
drank
and
walked
but
the
only
thing
i
wanted
was
to
get
away
and
get
down
somewhere
into
myself
and
hide
religion
of
course
seemed
no
good
at
all
i
do
understand
quite
what
people
mean
by
of
religion
religion
does
seem
to
me
a
thing
like
art
or
music
in
which
you
can
take
refuge
it
either
covers
everything
or
it
religion
religion
never
has
seemed
to
me
i
do
know
if
i
wrong
one
thing
like
other
things
so
that
you
can
change
about
and
back
again
it
either
the
background
and
foreground
all
in
one
or
a
kind
of
game
it
either
true
or
it
a
pretense
well
all
this
in
a
way
taught
me
it
was
absolutely
true
things
would
have
held
together
at
all
unless
it
was
true
but
it
was
no
sort
of
satisfaction
it
seemed
to
me
for
a
while
that
it
was
horrible
that
it
was
true
that
it
was
frightful
to
think
that
god
could
be
like
that
since
this
had
really
happened
but
i
did
feel
all
this
exactly
consciously
at
the
time
i
seemed
as
if
i
was
ill
and
could
only
lie
still
and
watch
and
be
in
hell
one
thing
however
father
hildebrand
thought
very
important
he
asked
me
about
it
particularly
was
that
i
honestly
did
not
feel
any
resentment
whatever
against
either
god
or
jenny
it
was
frightful
but
it
was
true
and
i
just
had
to
lie
still
inside
and
look
at
it
he
tells
me
that
this
shows
that
the
first
part
of
the
as
he
called
it
was
finished
he
called
it
the
way
and
i
must
say
that
what
happened
next
seems
to
fit
in
rather
well
the
new
began
quite
suddenly
when
i
awoke
in
the
hut
one
morning
at
ripon
the
instant
i
awoke
i
knew
it
it
was
very
early
in
the
morning
just
before
sunrise
but
there
was
a
little
wood
behind
me
and
the
birds
were
beginning
to
chirp
it
very
hard
to
describe
it
in
words
but
the
first
thing
to
say
is
that
i
was
not
exactly
happy
just
then
but
absolutely
content
i
think
i
should
say
that
it
was
like
this
i
saw
suddenly
that
what
had
been
wrong
in
me
was
that
i
had
made
myself
the
center
of
things
and
god
a
kind
of
circumference
when
he
did
or
allowed
things
i
said
does
he
my
point
of
that
is
to
say
i
set
up
my
ideas
of
justice
and
love
and
so
forth
and
then
compared
his
with
mine
not
mine
with
his
and
i
suddenly
saw
or
rather
i
knew
already
when
i
awoke
that
this
was
simply
stupid
even
now
i
can
not
imagine
why
i
did
see
it
before
i
had
heard
people
say
it
of
course
in
sermons
and
books
but
i
suppose
it
had
meant
nothing
to
me
father
hildebrand
tells
me
that
i
had
seen
it
intellectually
but
had
never
embraced
it
with
my
will
because
when
one
once
really
sees
that
there
no
longer
any
puzzle
about
anything
one
can
simply
never
say
again
the
thing
finished
now
this
as
father
calls
it
has
gone
on
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
ever
since
that
beginning
near
ripon
was
like
opening
a
door
into
another
country
and
i
been
walking
ever
since
and
seeing
new
things
all
sorts
of
things
that
i
had
believed
as
a
catholic
things
i
mean
which
i
assented
to
simply
because
the
church
said
so
have
so
to
speak
come
up
and
turned
themselves
inside
out
i
could
write
them
down
because
you
ca
write
these
things
down
or
even
put
them
intelligibly
to
yourself
you
just
that
they
are
for
instance
one
morning
at
mass
quite
suddenly
i
saw
how
the
substance
of
the
bread
was
changed
and
how
our
lord
is
united
with
the
soul
at
communion
of
course
it
a
mystery
that
what
i
mean
by
saying
that
it
ca
be
written
down
but
i
saw
it
in
a
flash
and
i
can
see
it
still
in
a
sort
of
way
then
another
day
when
the
major
was
talking
about
something
or
other
i
think
it
was
about
the
club
he
used
to
belong
to
in
piccadilly
i
understood
about
our
lady
and
how
she
is
just
everything
from
one
point
of
view
and
so
on
i
had
that
kind
of
thing
at
doctor
whitty
a
good
deal
particularly
when
i
was
getting
better
i
could
talk
to
him
all
the
time
too
or
count
the
knobs
on
the
wardrobe
or
listen
to
the
major
and
gertie
in
the
garden
and
yet
go
on
all
the
time
seeing
things
i
knew
it
was
any
good
talking
to
doctor
whitty
himself
much
though
i
ca
imagine
why
a
man
like
that
see
it
all
for
himself
it
seems
to
me
most
extraordinary
now
that
i
ever
could
have
had
those
other
thoughts
i
told
father
about
i
mean
about
sins
and
about
wondering
whether
after
all
the
church
was
actually
true
in
a
sort
of
way
of
course
they
come
back
to
me
still
and
i
know
perfectly
well
i
must
be
on
my
guard
but
somehow
it
different
well
all
this
is
what
father
calls
the
way
and
i
think
i
understand
what
he
means
it
came
to
a
sort
of
point
on
all
souls
eve
at
the
monastery
i
saw
the
whole
thing
then
for
a
moment
or
two
and
not
only
purgatory
but
i
will
write
that
down
later
and
father
tells
me
that
i
must
begin
to
look
forward
to
a
new
what
he
calls
the
of
union
i
do
understand
much
what
he
means
by
that
i
do
see
that
more
could
happen
to
me
i
am
absolutely
and
entirely
happy
though
i
must
say
that
there
has
seemed
a
sort
of
lull
for
the
last
day
or
two
ever
since
all
souls
day
in
fact
perhaps
something
is
going
to
happen
it
all
right
anyhow
it
seems
very
odd
to
me
that
all
this
kind
of
thing
is
perfectly
well
known
to
priests
i
thought
i
was
the
first
person
who
had
ever
felt
quite
like
this
i
must
add
one
thing
father
asked
me
whether
i
did
feel
i
had
a
vocation
to
the
religious
life
he
told
me
that
from
everything
he
could
see
i
had
and
that
my
coming
to
the
monastery
was
simply
providential
well
i
do
agree
and
i
have
told
him
so
i
have
the
least
idea
what
is
going
to
happen
next
but
i
know
absolutely
for
certain
that
i
have
got
to
go
on
with
the
major
and
gertie
to
east
london
gertie
will
have
to
be
got
away
from
the
major
somehow
and
until
that
is
done
i
must
do
anything
else
i
have
written
all
this
down
as
plainly
as
i
can
because
i
promised
father
i
would
part
iii
chapter
i
partington
was
standing
at
the
door
of
her
house
towards
sunset
waiting
for
the
children
to
come
back
from
school
her
house
is
situated
in
perhaps
the
least
agreeable
street
turner
road
in
perhaps
the
least
agreeable
district
of
east
london
hackney
wick
it
is
a
disagreeable
district
because
it
is
anything
in
particular
it
has
neither
the
tragic
gayety
of
whitechapel
nor
the
comparative
refinement
of
clapton
it
is
a
large
triangular
piece
of
land
containing
perhaps
a
square
mile
altogether
or
rather
more
approached
from
the
south
by
the
archway
of
the
great
eastern
railway
defined
on
one
side
by
the
line
and
along
its
other
two
sides
partly
by
the
river
lea
a
grimy
stream
and
partly
by
the
hackney
marshes
flat
dreary
wastes
of
land
useless
as
building
ground
and
of
value
only
for
saturday
afternoon
recreations
of
rabbit
coursing
and
football
the
dismalness
of
the
place
is
beyond
description
at
all
times
of
the
year
in
winter
it
is
bleak
and
chilly
in
summer
it
is
hot
and
hideously
and
ironically
reminiscent
of
real
fields
and
real
grass
the
population
is
calculated
to
change
completely
about
every
three
years
and
i
sure
i
am
not
surprised
it
possesses
two
important
blocks
of
buildings
besides
the
schools
a
large
jam
factory
and
the
church
and
of
the
eton
mission
turner
road
is
perhaps
the
most
hopeless
of
all
the
dozen
and
a
half
of
streets
it
is
marked
black
by
the
way
in
booth
instructive
map
it
is
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
and
perfectly
straight
it
is
intersected
at
one
point
by
another
street
and
is
composed
of
tall
dark
houses
with
flat
fronts
perhaps
six
or
seven
stories
in
height
it
is
generally
fairly
silent
and
empty
and
is
inhabited
by
the
most
characteristic
members
of
the
hackney
wick
community
quiet
men
lean
women
draggled
and
and
countless
children
all
of
the
class
that
seldom
remain
long
anywhere
all
of
the
material
out
of
which
the
real
criminal
is
developed
no
booths
or
stalls
ever
stand
here
only
on
saturday
nights
there
is
echoed
here
as
in
a
pit
the
cries
and
the
from
the
busy
thoroughfare
a
hundred
yards
away
round
the
corner
the
road
as
a
whole
bears
an
aspect
of
desperate
and
fierce
dignity
there
is
never
here
the
glimpse
of
a
garden
or
of
flowers
as
in
mortimer
road
a
stone
throw
away
there
is
nothing
whatever
except
the
tall
flat
houses
the
pavements
the
lampposts
the
grimy
thoroughfare
and
the
silence
the
sensation
of
the
visitor
is
that
anything
might
happen
here
and
that
no
one
would
be
the
wiser
there
is
an
air
of
horrible
discretion
about
these
houses
partington
was
indeed
is
for
i
went
to
see
her
not
two
months
ago
of
a
perfectly
defined
type
she
must
have
been
a
handsome
factory
girl
dark
slender
and
perfectly
able
to
take
care
of
herself
with
thin
muscular
arms
generally
visible
up
to
the
elbow
hard
hands
a
quantity
of
rather
untidy
hair
with
the
tongue
of
a
venomous
orator
and
any
amount
of
very
inferior
sentiment
patriotic
and
domestic
she
has
become
a
lean
woman
very
upright
and
very
strong
without
any
sentiment
at
all
but
with
a
great
deal
of
very
practical
human
experience
to
take
its
place
she
has
no
illusions
about
either
this
world
or
the
next
she
has
borne
nine
children
of
which
three
survive
and
her
husband
is
almost
uninterruptedly
out
of
work
however
they
are
prosperous
for
turner
road
and
have
managed
so
far
to
keep
their
home
together
the
sunset
was
framed
in
a
glow
of
smoky
glory
at
the
end
of
the
street
down
which
partington
was
staring
resembling
a
rather
angry
turned
on
from
the
gates
of
heaven
the
street
was
still
quiet
but
already
from
the
direction
of
the
came
thin
and
shrill
cries
as
the
swarm
of
children
exploded
in
all
directions
partington
she
would
have
said
was
waiting
for
her
children
jimmy
maggie
and
and
there
were
lying
within
upon
the
bare
table
three
thick
slices
of
bread
and
black
jam
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
looking
out
for
her
lodgers
who
should
have
arrived
by
midday
then
she
became
aware
that
they
were
coming
even
as
she
looked
advancing
down
the
empty
street
two
of
them
she
knew
well
enough
they
had
lodged
with
her
before
but
the
third
was
to
be
a
stranger
and
she
was
already
interested
in
him
the
major
had
hinted
at
wonderful
mysteries
so
she
shaded
her
eyes
against
the
cold
glare
and
watched
them
carefully
with
that
same
firm
resolute
face
with
which
she
always
looked
out
upon
the
world
and
even
as
presently
she
exchanged
that
quick
silent
nod
of
recognition
with
the
major
and
gertie
still
she
watched
the
shabby
young
man
who
came
last
carrying
his
bundle
and
walking
a
little
lame
you
after
your
time
she
said
abruptly
the
major
began
his
explanations
but
she
cut
them
short
and
led
the
way
into
the
house
ii
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
record
accurately
the
impression
that
frank
made
upon
partington
but
that
the
impression
was
deep
and
definite
became
perfectly
clear
to
me
from
her
conversation
he
hardly
spoke
at
all
she
said
and
before
he
got
work
at
the
jam
factory
he
went
out
for
long
lonely
walks
across
the
marshes
he
and
the
major
slept
together
it
seemed
in
one
room
and
gertie
temporarily
with
the
children
and
partington
in
another
partington
at
this
time
happened
to
be
away
on
one
of
his
long
absences
at
meals
frank
was
always
quiet
and
yet
not
ostentatiously
partington
found
no
fault
with
him
in
that
way
he
would
talk
to
the
children
a
little
before
they
went
to
school
and
would
meet
them
sometimes
on
their
way
back
from
school
and
all
three
of
them
conceived
for
him
an
immense
and
indescribable
adoration
all
this
however
would
be
too
long
to
set
down
in
detail
it
seems
to
have
been
a
certain
air
of
pathos
which
partington
herself
cast
around
him
which
affected
her
the
most
and
i
imagine
her
feeling
to
have
been
largely
motherly
there
was
however
another
element
very
obviously
visible
which
in
anyone
but
partington
i
should
call
reverence
she
told
me
that
she
could
not
imagine
why
he
was
traveling
with
the
major
and
gertie
so
she
at
least
understood
something
of
the
gulf
between
them
so
the
first
week
crept
by
bringing
us
up
to
the
middle
of
december
it
was
on
the
friday
night
that
frank
came
back
with
the
announcement
that
he
was
to
go
to
work
at
the
jam
factory
on
monday
there
was
a
great
pressure
of
course
owing
to
the
approach
of
christmas
and
frank
was
to
be
given
joint
charge
of
a
van
the
work
would
last
it
seemed
at
any
rate
for
a
week
or
two
you
have
to
mind
your
language
said
the
major
jocosely
he
was
sitting
in
the
room
where
the
cooking
was
done
and
where
by
the
way
the
entire
party
with
the
exception
of
the
two
men
slept
and
at
this
moment
had
his
feet
on
the
low
mantelshelf
between
the
saucepan
and
jimmy
cap
eh
said
frank
no
language
allowed
there
said
the
major
they
damn
particular
frank
put
his
cap
down
and
took
his
seat
on
the
bed
where
gertie
he
asked
yes
come
on
jimmie
jimmie
crept
up
beside
him
looking
at
him
with
big
black
reverential
eyes
then
he
leaned
against
him
with
a
quick
smile
and
closed
his
eyes
ecstatically
frank
put
an
arm
round
the
boy
to
support
him
oh
gertie
gone
to
see
a
friend
said
the
major
did
you
want
her
frank
said
nothing
and
partington
looked
from
one
to
the
other
swiftly
partington
had
gathered
a
little
food
for
thought
during
the
last
few
days
it
had
become
perfectly
evident
to
her
that
the
girl
was
very
much
in
love
with
this
young
man
and
that
while
this
young
man
either
was
or
affected
to
be
ignorant
of
it
the
major
was
not
gertie
had
odd
silences
when
frank
came
into
the
room
or
yet
more
odd
volubilities
and
partington
was
not
quite
sure
of
the
attitude
this
officer
and
her
husband
had
had
dealings
together
in
the
past
of
a
nature
which
i
could
not
quite
determine
indeed
the
figure
of
partington
is
still
a
complete
mystery
to
me
and
rather
a
formidable
mystery
and
i
gather
that
partington
had
learned
from
her
husband
that
the
major
was
not
simply
negligible
she
knew
him
for
a
blackguard
but
she
seems
to
have
been
uncertain
of
what
kind
was
this
whether
of
the
strong
or
the
weak
variety
she
was
just
a
little
uncomfortable
therefore
as
to
the
significance
of
gertie
and
had
already
wondered
more
than
once
whether
or
no
she
should
say
a
motherly
word
to
the
young
man
there
came
a
sound
of
footsteps
up
the
street
as
partington
ironed
a
collar
of
jimmie
on
the
table
and
laid
down
the
iron
as
a
tap
fell
on
the
door
the
major
took
out
his
pipe
and
began
to
fill
it
as
she
went
out
to
see
who
was
knocking
oh
good
evening
partington
sounded
in
a
clear
voice
from
the
street
door
may
i
come
in
for
a
minute
or
two
i
heard
you
had
lodgers
and
i
thought
perhaps
well
sir
we
rather
just
now
and
oh
i
wo
disturb
you
more
than
a
minute
came
the
other
voice
again
there
were
footsteps
in
the
passage
and
the
next
instant
past
the
unwilling
hostess
there
came
a
young
clergyman
carrying
a
silk
hat
into
the
lamplight
of
the
kitchen
frank
stood
up
instantly
and
the
major
went
so
far
as
to
take
down
his
feet
then
he
too
stood
up
good
evening
said
the
clergyman
may
i
just
come
in
for
a
minute
or
two
i
heard
you
had
come
and
as
it
in
my
district
may
i
sit
down
mrs
partington
partington
with
sternly
knit
lips
swept
a
brown
teapot
a
stocking
a
comb
a
cup
and
a
crumby
plate
off
the
single
unoccupied
chair
and
set
it
a
little
forward
near
the
fire
clergymen
were
to
her
mind
one
of
those
mysterious
dispensations
of
the
world
for
which
there
was
no
adequate
explanation
at
all
like
policemen
and
men
gamblings
and
there
they
were
and
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
they
were
mildly
useful
for
entertaining
the
children
and
taking
them
to
southend
and
in
cases
of
absolute
despair
they
could
be
relied
upon
for
or
even
but
the
big
mysterious
church
with
its
gilded
screen
its
curious
dark
glass
and
its
white
little
with
the
morris
hangings
the
great
the
ladies
the
parish
magazine
and
all
the
rest
of
it
these
were
simply
inexplicable
above
all
inexplicable
was
the
passion
displayed
for
that
strange
impulse
that
drove
four
young
men
in
black
and
high
hats
and
ridiculous
little
collars
during
five
afternoons
in
the
week
to
knock
at
door
after
door
all
over
the
district
and
conduct
conversations
with
bored
but
polite
mothers
of
families
it
was
one
of
the
phenomena
that
had
to
be
accepted
she
supposed
it
stood
for
something
beyond
her
perceptions
i
thought
i
must
come
in
and
make
your
acquaintance
said
the
clergyman
nursing
his
hat
and
smiling
at
the
company
he
too
occasionally
shared
partington
wonder
as
to
the
object
of
all
this
but
he
too
submitted
to
it
as
part
of
the
system
people
come
and
go
so
quickly
you
know
very
pleased
to
see
a
clergyman
said
the
major
smoothly
no
objection
to
smoke
sir
i
presume
he
indicated
his
pipe
not
at
all
said
the
clergyman
in
fact
i
smoke
myself
and
if
partington
will
allow
me
he
produced
a
small
pink
and
gilded
packet
of
cinderellas
i
think
he
thought
it
brought
him
vaguely
nearer
the
people
to
smoke
cinderellas
oh
no
objection
at
all
sir
put
in
partington
still
a
little
grimly
she
was
still
secretly
resenting
being
called
upon
at
six
you
were
usually
considered
immune
from
this
kind
of
thing
after
five
so
i
thought
i
must
just
look
in
and
catch
you
one
evening
explained
the
clergyman
once
more
and
tell
you
that
we
your
friends
here
the
clergy
you
know
and
about
the
church
and
all
that
he
was
an
extremely
conscientious
young
man
this
an
old
etonian
of
course
and
now
in
his
first
curacy
it
was
all
pretty
bewildering
to
him
too
this
great
and
splendid
establishment
the
glorious
church
by
bodley
with
the
magnificat
in
gothic
lettering
below
the
roof
the
and
furnished
the
ladies
house
the
zeal
the
the
parochial
machinery
the
band
of
hope
the
men
and
boys
clubs
and
above
all
the
furious
of
course
it
produced
results
it
kept
up
the
standards
of
decency
and
civilization
and
ideals
it
was
a
weight
in
the
balances
on
the
side
of
right
and
good
living
the
clubs
kept
men
from
the
to
some
extent
and
made
it
possible
for
boys
to
grow
up
with
some
chance
on
their
side
yet
he
wondered
in
fits
of
despondency
whether
there
were
not
something
wrong
somewhere
but
he
accepted
it
it
was
the
approved
method
and
he
himself
was
a
learner
not
a
teacher
very
kind
of
you
sir
said
the
major
replacing
his
feet
on
the
mantelshelf
and
at
what
time
are
the
services
on
sunday
the
clergyman
jumped
he
was
not
accustomed
to
that
sort
of
question
i
he
began
i
a
strong
churchman
sir
said
the
major
and
even
if
i
were
not
one
must
set
an
example
you
know
i
may
be
but
particular
about
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
shall
be
with
you
on
sunday
he
nodded
reassuringly
at
well
we
have
morning
prayer
at
next
sunday
and
the
holy
eucharist
at
eleven
and
of
course
at
eight
no
vestments
i
hope
said
the
major
sternly
faltered
a
little
vestments
were
not
in
use
but
to
his
regret
well
we
do
use
vestments
he
said
but
the
major
resumed
his
pipe
with
a
satisfied
air
that
all
right
he
said
now
i
not
bigoted
my
friend
here
a
roman
catholic
but
the
clergyman
looked
up
sharply
and
for
the
first
time
became
consciously
conscious
of
the
second
man
frank
had
sat
back
again
on
the
bed
with
jimmie
beside
him
and
was
watching
the
little
scene
quietly
and
silently
and
the
clergyman
met
his
eyes
full
some
vague
shock
thrilled
through
him
frank
brown
face
seemed
somehow
familiar
or
was
it
something
else
considered
the
point
for
a
little
while
in
silence
only
half
attending
to
the
major
who
was
now
announcing
his
views
on
the
establishment
and
the
reformation
settlement
frank
said
nothing
at
all
and
there
grew
on
the
clergyman
a
desire
to
hear
his
voice
he
made
an
opportunity
at
last
yes
i
see
he
said
to
the
major
and
you
i
do
know
your
name
gregory
sir
said
frank
and
again
a
little
shock
thrilled
the
voice
was
the
kind
of
thing
he
had
expected
from
that
face
it
was
about
ten
minutes
later
that
the
clergyman
thought
it
was
time
to
go
he
had
the
major
positive
promise
to
attend
at
least
the
evening
service
on
the
following
sunday
a
promise
he
did
not
somehow
very
much
appreciate
but
he
had
made
no
progress
with
frank
he
shook
hands
all
round
very
carefully
told
jimmie
not
to
miss
and
publicly
commended
maggie
for
a
recitation
she
had
accomplished
at
the
band
of
hope
on
the
previous
evening
and
then
went
out
accompanied
by
partington
still
silent
as
far
as
the
door
but
as
he
actually
went
out
someone
pushed
by
the
woman
and
came
out
into
the
street
may
i
speak
to
you
a
minute
said
the
strange
young
man
dropping
the
sir
i
walk
with
you
as
far
as
the
if
you
let
me
when
they
were
out
of
earshot
of
the
house
frank
began
you
are
you
he
said
of
hales
the
other
nodded
things
were
beginning
to
resolve
themselves
in
his
mind
well
will
you
give
me
your
word
not
to
tell
a
soul
i
here
and
tell
you
who
i
am
you
forgotten
me
i
see
but
i
afraid
you
may
remember
see
all
right
i
guiseley
of
drew
we
were
in
the
same
division
once
up
to
rawlins
do
you
remember
good
lord
but
yes
i
know
but
do
let
go
into
that
i
not
done
anything
i
should
that
not
the
reason
i
like
this
it
just
turned
out
so
and
there
something
else
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
when
can
i
come
and
see
you
privately
i
going
to
begin
work
at
the
jam
factory
the
other
man
clutched
at
his
whirling
faculties
at
ten
will
that
do
all
right
what
am
i
to
say
when
i
ring
the
bell
i
mean
just
ask
for
me
they
show
you
straight
up
to
my
room
all
right
said
frank
and
was
gone
iii
room
in
the
was
of
the
regular
type
very
comfortable
and
pleasing
to
the
eye
as
it
ought
to
be
for
a
young
man
working
under
such
circumstances
not
really
luxurious
pious
and
virile
the
walls
were
a
rosy
distemper
very
warm
and
sweet
and
upon
them
above
the
low
oak
hung
school
and
college
groups
discreet
sporting
engravings
a
glorious
cathedral
interior
and
the
sistine
madonna
over
the
mantelpiece
an
oar
hung
all
along
one
ceiling
painted
on
the
blade
with
the
arms
of
an
oxford
college
there
was
a
small
surmounted
by
a
crucifix
of
workmanship
there
was
a
mahogany
with
a
revolving
chair
set
before
it
there
were
a
couple
of
deep
padded
a
and
a
row
of
photographs
his
mother
in
evening
dress
a
couple
of
sisters
with
other
relations
altogether
with
the
curtains
drawn
and
the
fire
blazing
it
was
exactly
the
kind
of
room
that
such
a
wholesome
young
man
ought
to
have
in
the
east
of
london
frank
was
standing
on
the
as
came
in
a
minute
or
two
after
ten
bearing
a
small
tray
with
a
covered
jug
two
cups
and
a
plate
of
cake
again
said
the
clergyman
have
some
cocoa
i
generally
bring
mine
up
here
sit
down
make
yourself
comfortable
frank
said
nothing
he
sat
down
he
put
his
cap
on
the
floor
by
his
chair
and
leaned
back
the
other
with
rather
nervous
movements
set
a
steaming
cup
by
his
side
and
a
small
silver
box
of
cigarettes
matches
and
an
then
he
sat
down
himself
took
a
long
pull
at
his
cocoa
and
waited
with
a
certain
apprehensiveness
who
else
is
here
asked
frank
abruptly
the
other
ran
through
the
three
names
with
a
short
biography
of
each
frank
nodded
reassured
at
the
end
that
all
right
he
said
all
before
my
time
i
expect
they
might
come
in
you
know
oh
no
said
the
clergyman
i
told
them
not
and
well
let
come
to
business
said
frank
it
about
a
girl
you
saw
that
man
you
saw
his
sort
did
you
well
he
a
bad
hat
and
he
got
a
girl
going
about
with
him
who
is
his
wife
i
want
to
get
her
home
again
to
her
people
yes
can
you
do
anything
do
say
you
can
if
you
ca
please
she
comes
from
chiswick
i
give
you
her
address
before
i
go
but
i
want
it
muddled
you
know
the
clergyman
swallowed
in
his
throat
he
had
only
been
ordained
eighteen
months
and
the
extreme
abruptness
and
reality
of
the
situation
took
him
a
little
aback
i
can
try
he
said
and
i
can
put
the
ladies
on
to
her
but
of
course
i
ca
undertake
of
course
but
do
you
think
there
a
reasonable
chance
if
not
better
have
another
try
myself
have
you
tried
then
oh
yes
half
a
dozen
times
a
fortnight
ago
was
the
last
and
i
really
thought
but
i
do
understand
are
these
people
your
friends
or
what
i
been
traveling
with
them
off
and
on
since
june
they
belong
to
you
so
far
as
they
belong
to
anyone
i
a
catholic
you
know
really
but
convert
last
june
do
let
argue
my
dear
chap
there
is
time
drew
a
breath
there
is
no
other
phrase
so
adequate
for
describing
his
condition
of
mind
as
the
old
one
concerning
head
and
heels
there
had
rushed
on
him
not
out
of
the
blue
but
what
was
even
more
surprising
out
of
the
very
dingy
sky
of
hackney
wick
and
turner
road
at
that
this
astonishing
young
man
muscular
who
had
turned
out
to
be
a
of
his
own
and
a
whose
reputation
during
the
three
hours
since
they
had
parted
he
had
swiftly
remembered
point
by
point
guiseley
of
drew
the
boy
who
had
thrown
off
his
coat
in
early
school
and
displayed
himself
shirtless
who
had
stolen
four
out
of
the
six
birches
on
a
certain
winter
morning
and
had
conversed
affably
with
the
head
in
school
yard
with
the
ends
of
the
birches
sticking
out
below
the
skirts
of
his
overcoat
who
had
been
discovered
on
the
fourth
of
june
with
an
air
of
reverential
innocence
dressing
the
bronze
statue
of
king
henry
vi
in
a
surplice
in
honor
of
the
day
and
now
here
he
was
and
from
his
dress
and
the
situation
of
his
to
be
reckoned
among
the
worst
of
the
loafing
class
and
yet
talking
with
an
air
of
complete
confidence
and
equality
of
a
disreputable
young
woman
his
companion
who
was
to
be
rescued
from
a
yet
more
disreputable
companion
and
restored
to
her
parents
in
chiswick
and
this
was
not
all
for
as
informed
me
himself
there
was
being
impressed
upon
him
during
this
interview
a
very
curious
sensation
which
he
was
hardly
able
even
after
consideration
to
put
into
words
a
sensation
concerning
the
personality
and
presence
of
this
young
man
which
he
could
only
describe
as
making
him
feel
beastly
queer
it
seems
to
have
been
about
this
point
that
he
first
perceived
it
clearly
distinguished
it
that
is
to
say
from
the
whole
atmosphere
of
startling
and
suggesting
mystery
that
surrounded
him
he
looked
at
frank
in
silence
a
moment
or
two
there
guiseley
sat
leaning
back
in
the
red
leather
chair
his
cocoa
still
untouched
he
was
in
a
villainous
suit
that
once
probably
had
been
dark
blue
the
jacket
was
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
and
a
grimy
muffler
surrounded
his
neck
his
trousers
were
a
great
deal
too
short
and
disclosed
above
a
yellow
sock
on
the
leg
nearest
to
him
about
four
inches
of
skin
his
boots
were
heavy
patched
and
entirely
uncleaned
and
the
upper
of
one
of
them
gaped
from
the
leather
over
the
instep
his
hands
were
deep
in
his
pockets
as
if
even
in
this
warm
room
he
felt
the
cold
there
was
nothing
remarkable
there
it
was
the
kind
of
figure
presented
by
unsatisfactory
candidates
for
the
men
club
and
yet
there
was
about
him
this
air
arresting
and
rather
disconcerting
it
was
a
sort
of
electric
serenity
if
i
understand
aright
a
zone
of
perfectly
still
energy
like
warmth
or
biting
cold
as
of
a
charged
force
it
was
like
a
real
person
standing
motionless
in
the
middle
of
a
picture
did
not
of
course
use
such
beautiful
similes
as
these
he
employed
the
kind
of
language
customary
to
men
who
have
received
a
public
school
and
university
education
half
slang
and
half
childishness
but
he
waved
his
hands
at
me
and
distorted
his
features
and
conveyed
on
the
whole
the
kind
of
impression
i
have
just
attempted
to
set
down
frank
then
seemed
as
much
out
of
place
in
this
perfectly
correct
and
suitable
little
room
as
an
indian
prince
in
buckingham
palace
or
if
you
prefer
it
an
english
nobleman
with
spats
in
delhi
he
was
just
entirely
different
from
it
all
he
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
he
was
wholly
out
of
place
not
exactly
as
regarded
his
manner
for
he
was
quite
at
his
ease
but
with
regard
to
his
significance
he
was
as
a
foreign
symbol
in
a
familiar
language
its
effect
upon
was
quite
clear
and
strong
he
instanced
to
me
the
fact
that
he
said
nothing
to
frank
about
his
soul
he
honestly
confessed
that
he
scarcely
even
wished
to
press
him
to
come
to
evensong
on
sunday
of
course
he
did
not
like
frank
being
a
roman
catholic
and
his
whole
intellectual
being
informed
him
that
it
was
because
frank
had
never
really
known
the
church
of
england
that
he
had
left
it
had
himself
learned
the
real
nature
of
the
church
of
england
at
the
pusey
house
at
oxford
but
there
are
certain
atmospheres
in
which
the
intellectual
convictions
are
not
very
important
and
this
was
one
of
them
so
here
the
two
young
men
sat
and
stared
at
one
another
or
rather
stared
at
frank
and
frank
looked
at
nothing
in
particular
you
have
drunk
your
cocoa
said
the
clergyman
suddenly
frank
turned
abruptly
took
up
the
cup
and
drank
the
contents
straight
off
at
one
draught
and
a
cigarette
frank
took
up
a
cigarette
and
put
in
his
mouth
by
the
way
he
said
taking
it
out
again
when
you
send
your
ladies
round
the
morning
best
when
the
rest
of
us
are
out
of
the
way
all
right
well
i
do
think
there
anything
else
my
dear
chap
said
the
other
i
wish
you
tell
me
what
it
all
about
why
you
in
this
sort
of
life
you
know
i
do
want
to
pry
but
frank
smiled
suddenly
and
vividly
oh
there
nothing
to
say
that
not
the
point
it
by
my
own
choice
practically
i
assure
you
i
have
disgraced
anybody
but
your
people
oh
they
all
right
there
nothing
the
matter
with
them
look
here
i
really
must
be
going
he
stood
up
and
something
seemed
to
snap
in
the
atmosphere
as
he
did
so
besides
i
got
to
be
at
work
early
i
say
what
did
you
do
then
do
then
what
do
you
mean
when
you
stood
up
did
you
say
anything
frank
looked
at
him
bewildered
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
did
not
quite
know
what
he
had
meant
himself
it
was
a
sensation
come
and
gone
in
an
instant
as
frank
had
moved
a
sensation
which
i
suppose
some
people
would
call
psychical
a
sensation
as
if
a
shock
had
vibrated
for
one
moment
through
every
part
of
his
own
being
and
of
the
pleasant
little
warm
room
where
he
was
sitting
he
looked
at
the
other
dazed
for
a
second
or
two
but
there
was
nothing
those
two
steady
black
eyes
looked
at
him
in
a
humorous
kind
of
concern
he
stood
up
himself
it
was
nothing
he
said
i
think
i
must
be
getting
sleepy
he
put
out
his
hand
he
said
oh
i
come
and
see
you
as
far
as
the
gate
frank
looked
at
him
a
second
i
say
he
said
i
suppose
you
never
thought
of
becoming
a
catholic
my
dear
chap
no
well
all
right
oh
do
bother
to
come
to
the
gate
i
coming
it
may
be
locked
stood
looking
after
frank
figure
even
after
it
had
passed
along
the
dark
shop
fronts
and
was
turning
the
corner
towards
turner
road
then
it
went
under
the
lamplight
and
disappeared
it
was
a
drizzling
cold
night
and
he
himself
was
bareheaded
he
felt
the
moisture
run
down
his
forehead
but
it
did
seem
to
be
happening
to
him
on
his
right
rose
up
the
big
where
the
entertainments
were
held
and
beyond
it
the
east
end
of
the
great
church
dark
now
and
tenantless
and
he
felt
the
wet
woodwork
of
the
gate
grasped
in
his
fingers
he
did
not
quite
know
what
was
happening
to
him
but
everything
seemed
different
a
hundred
thoughts
had
passed
through
his
mind
during
the
last
half
hour
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
he
ought
to
have
asked
guiseley
to
come
to
the
and
lodge
there
for
a
bit
while
things
were
talked
over
that
he
ought
tactfully
to
have
offered
to
lend
him
money
to
provide
him
with
a
new
suit
to
make
suggestions
as
to
proper
employment
instead
of
at
the
jam
factory
all
those
proper
philanthropic
and
prudent
suggestions
that
a
really
sensible
clergyman
would
have
made
and
yet
somehow
not
only
had
he
not
made
them
but
it
was
obvious
and
evident
when
he
regarded
them
that
they
could
not
possibly
be
made
guiseley
of
drew
did
not
require
them
he
was
on
another
line
altogether
and
what
was
that
line
leaned
on
the
gate
a
full
five
minutes
considering
all
this
but
he
arrived
at
no
conclusion
chapter
ii
i
the
rector
of
merefield
was
returning
from
a
short
pastoral
visitation
towards
the
close
of
an
afternoon
at
the
beginning
of
november
his
method
and
aims
were
very
characteristic
of
himself
since
he
was
one
of
that
numerous
class
of
persons
who
interiorly
possessing
their
full
share
of
proper
pride
wear
exteriorly
an
appearance
of
extreme
and
almost
timid
humility
the
aims
of
his
visiting
were
though
he
was
quite
unaware
of
the
fact
directed
towards
encouraging
people
to
hold
fast
to
their
proper
position
in
life
for
this
after
all
is
only
another
name
for
one
duty
towards
one
neighbor
and
his
method
was
to
engage
in
general
conversation
on
local
topics
there
emerged
in
this
way
information
as
to
the
patient
habits
and
actions
it
would
thus
transpire
for
example
whether
the
patient
had
been
to
church
or
not
whether
there
were
any
quarrels
and
if
so
who
were
the
combatants
and
for
what
cause
he
had
been
fairly
satisfied
he
had
met
with
good
excuses
for
the
absence
of
two
children
from
and
of
a
young
man
from
he
had
read
a
little
scripture
to
an
old
man
and
had
been
edified
by
his
comments
upon
it
it
was
not
particularly
supernatural
but
after
all
the
natural
has
its
place
too
in
life
and
he
had
undoubtedly
fulfilled
some
of
the
duties
for
whose
sake
he
occupied
the
position
of
rector
of
merefield
in
a
completely
inoffensive
manner
the
things
he
hated
most
in
the
world
were
disturbances
of
any
kind
abruptness
and
the
unexpected
and
he
had
a
strong
reputation
in
the
village
for
being
a
man
of
peace
it
sounds
a
hard
thing
to
say
of
so
conscientious
a
man
but
a
properly
preserved
social
order
was
perhaps
to
his
mind
the
nearest
approach
to
the
establishment
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
on
earth
each
person
held
his
proper
position
including
himself
and
he
no
more
expected
others
to
be
untrue
to
their
station
than
he
wished
to
be
untrue
to
his
own
there
were
of
course
two
main
divisions
those
of
gentle
birth
and
those
not
of
gentle
birth
and
these
were
as
distinct
as
the
sexes
but
there
were
endless
gradations
in
each
respectively
and
he
himself
regarded
those
with
as
much
respect
as
those
of
the
angelic
hierarchy
the
dominations
might
or
might
not
be
as
good
as
the
powers
but
they
were
certainly
different
by
divine
decree
it
would
be
a
species
of
human
blasphemy
therefore
for
himself
not
to
stand
up
in
lord
talgarth
presence
or
for
a
laborer
not
to
touch
his
hat
to
miss
jenny
this
is
sometimes
called
snobbishness
but
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind
it
is
merely
a
marked
form
of
toryism
it
was
a
pleasant
autumnal
kind
of
afternoon
and
he
took
off
his
hat
as
he
turned
up
past
the
park
gates
to
feel
the
cool
air
as
he
was
a
little
heated
with
his
walk
he
felt
exceedingly
content
with
all
things
there
were
no
troubles
in
the
parish
he
enjoyed
excellent
health
and
he
had
just
done
his
duty
he
disliked
pastoral
visiting
very
deeply
indeed
he
was
essentially
a
timid
kind
of
man
but
he
made
his
rules
and
kept
them
for
he
was
essentially
a
conscientious
man
he
was
so
conscientious
that
he
was
probably
quite
unaware
that
he
disliked
this
particular
duty
just
as
he
came
opposite
the
gates
great
affairs
with
ramping
eagles
and
a
gothic
lodge
smothered
in
ivy
the
man
ran
out
and
began
to
wheel
them
back
after
a
hasty
salute
to
his
pastor
and
the
rector
turning
saw
a
sight
that
increased
his
complacency
it
was
just
jenny
riding
with
lord
talgarth
as
he
knew
she
was
doing
that
afternoon
they
made
a
handsome
courtly
kind
of
pair
a
sort
of
father
and
daughter
after
some
romantic
artist
or
other
lord
talgarth
heavy
figure
looked
on
horseback
and
he
sat
his
big
black
mare
very
tolerably
indeed
and
jenny
looked
delicious
on
the
white
mare
herself
in
dark
green
a
groom
followed
twenty
yards
behind
lord
talgarth
big
face
nodded
genially
to
the
rector
and
he
made
a
kind
of
salute
he
seemed
in
excellent
dispositions
jenny
was
a
little
flushed
with
exercise
and
smiled
at
her
father
with
a
quiet
friendly
dignity
just
taking
her
ladyship
home
said
the
old
man
yes
charming
day
is
it
the
rector
followed
them
pleased
at
heart
usually
jenny
rode
home
alone
with
the
groom
to
take
back
her
mare
to
the
stables
it
was
the
first
time
so
far
as
he
could
remember
that
lord
talgarth
had
taken
the
trouble
to
escort
her
all
the
way
home
himself
it
really
was
very
pleasant
indeed
and
very
creditable
to
jenny
tact
that
relations
were
so
cordial
and
they
were
dining
there
too
the
social
order
of
merefield
seemed
to
be
in
an
exceedingly
sound
condition
ii
lord
talgarth
too
seemed
to
the
as
ten
minutes
later
the
gates
rolled
back
again
to
welcome
their
lord
in
an
unusually
genial
temper
and
indeed
there
was
always
about
this
old
man
as
great
a
capacity
for
geniality
on
one
side
as
for
temper
on
the
other
it
is
usually
so
with
explosive
characters
he
even
checked
his
horse
and
asked
after
the
missus
in
so
many
words
although
two
days
before
a
violent
message
had
come
down
to
complain
of
laxity
in
the
owing
to
the
missus
indisposition
on
an
occasion
when
the
official
himself
had
been
digging
cabbages
behind
the
gothic
lodge
and
the
hoot
of
the
motor
had
not
been
heard
the
missus
it
seemed
was
up
and
about
again
indeed
her
husband
caught
a
glimpse
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
of
a
pale
face
that
glanced
and
withdrew
again
apprehensively
above
the
muslin
curtain
beyond
his
lordship
that
all
right
remarked
lord
talgarth
heartily
and
rode
on
the
exchanged
a
solemn
wink
with
the
groom
half
a
minute
later
and
stood
to
watch
the
heavy
figure
ahead
plunging
about
rather
in
the
saddle
as
the
big
black
mare
set
her
feet
upon
the
turf
and
viewed
her
stable
afar
off
it
was
a
fact
that
lord
talgarth
was
pleased
with
himself
and
all
the
world
for
he
kept
it
up
even
with
the
footman
who
slipped
and
all
but
lost
his
balance
as
he
brought
tea
into
the
library
hold
up
remarked
the
nobleman
the
footman
smiled
gently
and
weakly
after
the
manner
of
a
dependent
and
related
the
incident
with
caustic
gusto
to
his
fellows
in
the
pantry
after
tea
lord
talgarth
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
appeared
to
meditate
as
was
observed
by
the
man
who
fetched
out
the
and
poked
the
fire
and
he
was
still
meditating
though
now
there
was
the
aromatic
smell
of
tobacco
upon
the
air
when
his
own
man
came
to
tell
him
that
it
was
time
to
dress
it
was
indeed
a
perfect
room
for
meditations
there
were
tall
mahogany
each
with
its
shaded
electric
lamp
the
carpet
was
as
deep
as
a
summer
lawn
and
in
the
wide
hearth
logs
consumed
themselves
in
an
almost
deferential
silence
there
was
every
conceivable
thing
that
could
be
wanted
laid
in
its
proper
place
it
was
the
kind
of
room
in
which
it
would
seem
that
no
scheme
could
miscarry
and
every
wish
must
prevail
the
objective
physical
world
grouped
itself
so
obediently
to
the
human
will
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
imagine
a
state
of
things
in
which
it
did
not
so
the
great
house
was
admirably
ordered
there
was
no
sound
that
there
should
not
be
no
hitches
no
gaps
or
cracks
anywhere
it
moved
like
a
machine
the
gong
sounded
in
the
great
hall
issued
invitations
rather
than
commands
all
was
leisurely
perfectly
adapted
and
irreproachable
it
is
always
more
difficult
for
people
who
live
in
such
houses
as
these
to
behave
well
under
adverse
fortune
than
for
those
who
live
in
houses
where
the
irish
stew
can
be
smelled
at
eleven
in
the
morning
and
where
the
doors
do
not
shut
properly
and
the
kitchen
range
goes
wrong
possibly
something
of
this
fact
helped
to
explain
the
extreme
violence
of
temper
on
the
occasion
of
his
son
revolt
it
was
intolerable
for
a
man
all
of
whose
other
surroundings
moved
like
clockwork
obedient
to
his
whims
to
be
disobeyed
flatly
by
one
whose
obedience
should
be
his
first
duty
to
find
disorder
and
rebellion
in
the
very
mainspring
of
the
whole
machine
possibly
too
the
little
scheme
that
was
maturing
in
lord
mind
between
tea
and
dinner
that
evening
helped
to
restore
his
geniality
for
as
soon
as
the
thought
was
conceived
it
became
obvious
that
it
could
be
carried
through
with
success
he
observed
aha
it
time
is
it
to
his
man
in
a
hearty
kind
of
way
and
hoisted
himself
out
of
his
chair
with
unusual
briskness
iii
he
spent
a
long
evening
again
in
the
library
alone
archie
was
away
and
after
dining
alone
with
all
the
usual
state
the
old
man
commanded
that
coffee
should
be
brought
after
him
the
butler
found
him
five
minutes
later
kneeling
before
a
tall
case
of
drawers
trying
various
keys
off
his
bunch
and
when
the
man
came
to
bring
in
whisky
and
clear
away
the
coffee
things
he
was
in
his
deep
chair
a
table
on
either
side
of
him
piled
with
papers
and
a
drawer
upon
his
knees
you
can
put
this
lot
back
he
remarked
to
the
young
footman
indicating
a
little
pile
of
four
drawers
on
the
he
watched
the
man
meditatively
as
he
attempted
to
fit
them
into
their
places
not
that
way
you
fool
have
you
got
eyes
the
top
one
at
the
top
but
he
said
it
without
bitterness
almost
contemplatively
and
as
the
butler
glanced
round
a
moment
or
two
later
to
see
that
all
was
in
order
he
saw
his
master
once
more
beginning
to
read
papers
said
lord
talgarth
my
lord
said
the
butler
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
that
night
in
the
men
wing
as
to
the
meaning
of
all
this
and
it
was
conducted
with
complete
frankness
merton
the
butler
had
retired
to
his
own
house
in
the
and
clarkson
the
valet
was
in
his
lordship
so
the
men
talked
freely
it
was
agreed
that
only
two
explanations
were
possible
for
the
unusual
sweetness
of
temper
either
frank
was
to
be
reinstated
or
his
father
was
beginning
to
break
up
frank
was
extremely
popular
with
servants
always
and
it
was
generally
hoped
that
the
former
explanation
was
the
true
one
possibly
however
both
were
required
clarkson
too
was
greatly
that
night
he
yawned
about
the
till
an
unusually
late
hour
for
lord
talgarth
generally
retired
to
rest
between
ten
and
however
it
was
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
before
the
man
stood
up
suddenly
from
the
sofa
at
the
sound
of
a
vibration
in
the
passage
outside
the
old
man
came
in
briskly
bearing
a
bundle
of
papers
in
one
hand
and
a
in
the
other
with
the
same
twinkle
of
good
temper
in
his
eyes
that
he
had
carried
all
the
evening
give
me
the
under
the
sofa
he
said
the
one
in
the
leather
case
this
was
done
and
the
papers
were
laid
in
it
carefully
on
the
top
clarkson
noticed
that
they
had
a
legal
appearance
were
and
inscribed
in
stiff
lettering
then
the
was
reclosed
and
set
on
the
which
my
lord
used
sometimes
when
he
was
unwell
remind
me
to
send
for
mr
manners
he
said
this
was
the
solicitor
getting
ready
for
bed
that
evening
was
almost
of
a
sensational
nature
and
clarkson
had
to
keep
all
his
wits
about
him
to
respond
with
sufficient
agility
to
the
sallies
of
his
master
usually
it
was
all
a
very
somber
ceremony
with
a
good
deal
of
groaning
and
snarling
in
asides
but
it
was
as
cheerful
as
possible
the
mysteries
of
it
all
are
too
great
for
me
to
attempt
to
pierce
them
but
it
is
really
incredible
what
a
number
of
processes
are
necessary
before
an
oldish
man
who
is
something
of
a
buck
and
something
of
an
invalid
and
altogether
is
able
to
lay
him
down
to
rest
there
are
strange
doses
to
be
prepared
and
drunk
strange
manipulations
to
be
performed
and
very
particular
little
ceremonies
to
be
observed
each
in
its
proper
place
each
was
accompanied
by
some
genial
comment
the
distillation
that
had
been
soaking
since
seven
in
hot
water
was
drunk
almost
with
the
air
of
a
toast
the
massaging
of
the
ankles
and
toes
an
exercise
invented
entirely
by
lord
talgarth
himself
might
have
been
almost
in
preparation
for
a
dance
he
stood
up
at
last
an
erect
stoutish
figure
in
quilted
and
pyjamas
before
the
fire
as
his
man
put
on
his
slippers
for
him
for
the
little
procession
into
the
next
room
i
think
i
better
clarkson
he
said
your
lordship
seems
very
well
indeed
my
lord
murmured
that
diplomat
on
the
how
old
do
you
think
i
am
clarkson
clarkson
knew
perfectly
well
but
it
was
better
to
make
a
deprecatory
confused
noise
ah
well
we
need
reckon
by
years
i
feel
young
enough
observed
the
stately
figure
before
the
fire
then
the
procession
was
formed
the
double
doors
were
set
back
the
electric
light
switched
on
lord
talgarth
passed
through
towards
the
great
bed
that
stood
out
into
the
bedroom
and
was
in
bed
with
scarcely
a
groan
almost
before
the
swift
clarkson
could
be
at
his
side
to
help
him
in
he
lay
there
his
ruddy
face
wonderfully
handsome
against
the
contrast
of
his
gray
hair
and
the
white
pillow
while
clarkson
concluded
the
other
and
final
ceremonies
a
small
table
had
to
be
wheeled
to
a
certain
position
beside
the
bed
and
the
handle
of
the
electric
cord
laid
upon
it
in
a
particular
place
between
the
book
and
the
tray
on
which
stood
some
other
very
special
draught
to
be
drunk
in
case
of
thirst
call
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
observed
the
face
on
the
pillow
i
take
a
little
stroll
before
breakfast
yes
my
lord
what
did
i
tell
you
to
remind
me
to
do
after
breakfast
send
for
mr
manners
my
lord
that
right
clarkson
my
lord
there
was
the
usual
discreet
glance
round
the
room
to
see
that
all
was
in
order
then
the
door
into
the
closed
imperceptibly
behind
clarkson
bent
back
chapter
iii
i
winter
at
merefield
rectory
is
almost
as
delightful
as
summer
although
in
an
entirely
different
way
the
fact
is
that
the
rectory
has
managed
the
perfect
english
compromise
in
summer
with
the
windows
and
doors
wide
open
with
the
heavy
radiant
creepers
with
the
lawns
lying
about
the
house
with
the
warm
air
flowing
over
the
smooth
polished
floors
and
lifting
the
thin
mats
with
the
endless
whistle
of
bird
song
then
the
place
seems
like
a
and
in
winter
with
the
heavy
carpets
down
and
the
thick
curtains
the
very
polished
floors
so
cool
in
summer
seem
expressly
designed
to
glimmer
warmly
with
candle
and
and
the
books
seem
to
lean
forward
protectively
and
reassert
themselves
and
the
low
beamed
ceilings
to
shelter
and
safeguard
the
interior
comfort
the
center
of
gravity
is
changed
almost
imperceptibly
in
summer
the
place
is
a
garden
with
a
house
in
the
middle
in
winter
a
house
surrounded
by
shrubberies
the
study
in
one
way
and
the
in
another
are
the
respective
pivots
of
the
house
the
study
is
a
little
paneled
room
on
the
looking
out
upon
the
last
of
the
line
of
old
yews
and
the
beginning
of
the
lawn
the
once
known
as
the
is
the
only
other
paneled
room
in
the
house
on
the
first
floor
looking
out
upon
the
front
and
round
these
two
rooms
the
two
sections
of
the
tranquilly
revolve
here
in
one
the
rector
controls
the
affairs
of
the
parish
writes
his
sermons
receives
his
men
friends
not
very
many
and
reads
his
books
there
in
the
other
jenny
orders
the
domestic
life
of
the
house
interviews
the
cook
and
occupies
herself
with
her
own
affairs
they
are
two
rival
but
perfectly
friendly
camps
lately
i
am
speaking
now
of
the
beginning
of
november
there
had
not
been
quite
so
much
communication
between
the
two
camps
as
usual
not
so
many
informal
negotiations
jenny
did
not
look
in
quite
so
often
upon
her
father
for
ten
minutes
after
breakfast
for
instance
or
before
lunch
and
when
he
looked
in
on
her
he
seemed
to
find
her
generally
with
rather
a
preoccupied
air
often
sitting
before
the
fireplace
with
her
hands
behind
her
head
looking
at
the
red
logs
he
was
an
easy
man
as
has
been
seen
and
did
not
greatly
trouble
his
head
about
it
he
knew
enough
of
the
world
to
recognize
that
an
extremely
beautiful
girl
like
jenny
living
on
the
terms
she
did
with
the
great
house
and
a
house
with
men
coming
and
going
continually
to
say
nothing
of
parties
and
balls
elsewhere
can
not
altogether
escape
complications
he
was
reasonable
enough
too
to
understand
that
a
father
is
not
always
the
best
confidant
and
he
had
supreme
confidence
in
jenny
common
sense
i
suppose
he
had
his
dreams
he
would
scarcely
have
been
human
if
he
had
not
and
he
was
quite
human
the
throwing
over
of
frank
had
brought
him
mixed
emotions
but
he
had
not
been
consulted
either
at
the
beginning
or
the
end
of
the
engagement
and
he
acquiesced
of
dick
affair
he
knew
nothing
at
all
that
then
was
the
situation
when
the
bomb
exploded
it
exploded
in
this
way
he
was
sitting
in
his
study
one
morning
to
be
accurate
it
was
the
first
saturday
in
november
two
days
after
the
events
of
the
last
chapter
preparing
to
begin
the
composition
of
his
sermon
for
the
next
day
they
had
dined
up
at
the
great
house
the
night
before
quite
quietly
with
lord
talgarth
and
archie
who
had
just
come
back
he
had
selected
his
text
with
great
care
from
the
gospel
for
the
day
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
jenny
came
in
this
was
very
unusual
on
saturday
morning
it
was
an
understood
thing
that
he
must
be
at
his
sermon
but
his
faint
sense
of
annoyance
was
completely
dispelled
by
his
daughter
face
she
was
quite
pale
not
exactly
as
if
she
had
received
a
shock
but
as
if
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
something
there
was
no
sign
of
tremor
in
her
face
on
the
contrary
she
looked
extremely
determined
but
her
eyes
searched
his
as
she
stopped
i
dreadfully
sorry
father
but
may
i
talk
to
you
for
a
few
minutes
she
did
not
wait
for
his
answer
but
came
straight
in
and
sat
down
in
his
he
laid
his
pen
down
and
turned
a
little
at
his
to
face
her
certainly
dear
what
is
it
nothing
wrong
he
noticed
she
had
a
note
in
her
hand
no
nothing
wrong
she
hesitated
but
it
rather
important
well
she
glanced
down
at
the
note
she
carried
then
she
looked
up
at
him
again
father
i
suppose
you
thought
of
my
marrying
some
day
in
spite
of
frank
eh
would
you
mind
if
i
married
a
man
older
than
myself
i
mean
a
good
deal
older
he
looked
at
her
in
silence
two
or
three
names
passed
before
his
mind
but
he
could
remember
father
i
in
trouble
i
really
am
i
did
expect
her
voice
faltered
he
saw
that
she
really
found
it
difficult
to
speak
a
little
wave
of
tenderness
rolled
over
his
heart
it
was
unlike
her
to
be
so
much
moved
he
got
up
and
came
round
to
her
what
is
it
dear
tell
me
she
remained
perfectly
motionless
for
an
instant
then
she
held
out
the
note
to
him
and
simultaneously
stood
up
as
he
took
it
she
went
swiftly
past
him
and
out
of
the
door
he
heard
the
swish
of
her
dress
pass
up
the
stairs
and
then
the
closing
of
a
door
but
he
hardly
heeded
it
he
was
reading
the
note
she
had
given
him
it
was
a
short
perfectly
formal
offer
of
marriage
to
her
from
lord
talgarth
ii
father
dear
said
jenny
i
want
you
to
let
me
have
my
say
straight
out
will
you
he
bowed
his
head
they
were
sitting
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
over
the
in
his
study
he
had
not
seen
her
alone
for
one
moment
since
the
morning
she
had
refused
to
open
her
door
to
him
when
he
went
up
after
reading
the
note
she
had
pleaded
a
headache
at
lunch
and
she
had
been
invisible
all
the
afternoon
then
as
he
came
in
about
she
had
descended
upon
him
rather
pale
but
perfectly
herself
perfectly
natural
and
even
rather
she
had
informed
him
that
tea
would
be
laid
in
his
study
as
she
wanted
a
long
talk
she
had
poured
out
tea
talking
all
the
time
refusing
it
seemed
to
meet
his
eyes
when
she
had
finished
she
had
poured
out
his
third
cup
and
then
pushed
her
own
low
chair
back
so
far
that
he
could
not
see
her
face
then
she
had
opened
the
engagement
to
say
that
the
poor
man
had
been
taken
aback
would
be
a
very
poor
way
of
describing
his
condition
the
thing
simply
had
never
entered
his
head
he
had
dreamed
in
wild
moments
of
archie
he
had
certainly
contemplated
dick
but
lord
talgarth
himself
gouty
and
aged
and
yet
he
had
not
been
indignant
indignation
not
only
did
not
do
with
jenny
but
it
was
impossible
to
be
quite
frank
the
man
was
afraid
of
his
daughter
he
was
aware
that
she
would
do
ultimately
as
she
wished
and
not
as
he
wished
and
his
extreme
discomfort
at
the
thought
of
this
old
man
marrying
his
daughter
was
since
he
was
human
partly
by
the
thought
of
who
the
old
man
was
lastly
it
must
be
remembered
that
jenny
was
really
a
very
sensible
girl
and
that
her
father
was
quite
conscious
of
the
fact
jenny
settled
herself
once
more
in
her
chair
and
began
father
dear
i
want
to
be
quite
sensible
about
this
and
i
been
very
foolish
and
silly
about
it
all
day
i
ca
imagine
why
i
behaved
as
i
did
there
nothing
to
go
and
mope
about
that
lord
talgarth
has
been
kind
enough
to
do
me
this
honor
because
it
is
an
honor
you
know
however
you
look
at
it
that
anyone
should
ask
one
to
be
his
wife
well
i
want
to
say
what
i
have
to
say
first
and
then
i
want
you
to
say
exactly
what
you
think
i
thought
it
all
out
so
i
sha
be
very
long
he
put
down
his
cup
noiselessly
as
if
in
the
presence
of
a
sick
person
he
was
anxious
not
to
lose
a
word
or
even
an
inflection
first
of
all
let
have
all
the
things
against
it
he
an
old
man
we
must
forget
that
for
one
minute
and
that
a
very
strong
argument
indeed
some
people
would
think
it
final
but
i
think
foolish
secondly
it
never
entered
my
head
for
one
instant
jenny
said
this
quite
deliberately
almost
reverently
of
course
i
see
now
that
hinted
at
it
very
often
but
i
never
understood
it
at
the
time
always
thought
of
him
as
a
sort
of
well
a
sort
of
uncle
and
another
strong
argument
against
it
if
it
was
a
right
thing
to
do
ought
it
to
have
occurred
to
me
too
i
not
quite
sure
about
that
thirdly
it
unsuitable
for
several
reasons
it
make
talk
here
have
i
been
engaged
to
frank
for
ages
and
broken
it
off
ca
you
imagine
how
people
will
interpret
that
now
i
suppose
i
ought
to
mind
what
people
say
but
i
afraid
i
do
then
i
the
rector
daughter
and
i
been
running
in
and
out
continually
dining
with
them
sitting
with
him
alone
ca
you
imagine
what
people
lady
richard
for
instance
will
make
of
it
i
shall
be
an
adventuress
and
all
the
rest
of
it
that
not
worth
much
as
an
argument
but
it
is
a
a
consideration
one
must
look
facts
in
the
face
and
think
of
the
future
fourthly
lord
talgarth
probably
wo
live
very
long
jenny
paused
and
then
with
extraordinary
impressiveness
continued
and
that
of
course
is
perhaps
the
strongest
argument
of
all
if
i
could
be
of
any
real
use
to
him
she
stopped
again
the
rector
shifted
a
little
in
his
chair
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
conceal
from
himself
any
longer
the
fact
that
up
to
now
he
had
really
been
expecting
jenny
to
accept
the
offer
but
he
was
a
little
puzzled
now
at
the
admirable
array
of
reasons
she
had
advanced
against
that
she
had
put
into
words
just
the
sensible
view
of
which
he
himself
had
only
had
a
confused
apprehension
she
had
analyzed
into
all
its
component
parts
that
general
sense
which
one
side
of
him
had
pushed
before
him
all
day
that
the
thing
was
really
abominable
and
this
side
of
him
at
this
time
was
uppermost
he
drew
a
whistling
breath
well
my
dear
he
began
and
the
relief
was
very
apparent
in
his
voice
but
jenny
interrupted
one
minute
please
father
in
fairness
to
to
everyone
i
must
put
the
other
side
i
suppose
the
main
question
is
this
after
all
am
i
fond
of
him
fond
enough
that
is
to
marry
him
because
of
course
fond
of
him
he
been
so
extraordinarily
kind
always
i
suppose
that
really
the
only
thing
to
be
considered
if
i
were
fond
enough
of
him
i
suppose
all
the
arguments
against
count
for
nothing
is
that
so
yes
i
want
you
to
say
what
you
think
he
waited
still
he
could
make
out
nothing
of
her
face
though
he
glanced
across
the
once
or
twice
my
dear
i
do
know
what
to
say
i
father
dear
i
just
want
that
from
you
do
you
think
that
any
consideration
at
all
ought
to
stand
in
the
way
if
i
were
i
do
say
for
one
single
moment
that
i
am
but
if
i
were
well
really
fond
of
him
i
sorry
to
have
to
speak
so
very
plainly
but
it
no
good
being
silly
he
swallowed
in
his
throat
once
or
twice
if
you
really
were
fond
of
him
i
think
i
think
that
no
consideration
of
the
sort
you
have
mentioned
ought
to
to
stand
in
your
way
thank
you
father
said
jenny
softly
when
did
you
first
think
of
it
jenny
paused
i
think
i
knew
he
was
going
to
ask
me
two
days
ago
the
day
you
met
us
out
riding
you
know
there
was
a
long
silence
they
had
already
discussed
when
frank
affair
had
been
before
them
all
secondary
details
the
rector
sister
was
to
have
taken
jenny
place
there
was
nothing
of
that
sort
to
talk
about
now
they
were
both
just
face
to
face
with
primary
things
and
they
both
knew
it
the
rector
mind
worked
like
a
mill
a
mill
whose
machinery
is
running
aimlessly
the
wheels
went
round
and
round
but
they
effected
nothing
he
was
completely
ignorant
as
to
what
jenny
intended
he
perceived
as
in
a
series
of
little
vignettes
a
number
of
hypothetical
events
on
this
side
and
that
but
they
drew
to
no
conclusion
in
his
mind
he
was
just
waiting
on
his
daughter
will
jenny
broke
the
silence
with
a
slow
remark
in
another
kind
of
voice
father
dear
there
something
else
i
must
tell
you
i
did
see
any
need
to
bother
you
with
it
before
it
this
dick
guiseley
proposed
to
me
when
he
was
here
for
the
shooting
she
paused
but
her
father
said
nothing
i
told
him
he
must
wait
that
i
did
know
for
certain
but
that
i
was
almost
certain
if
he
had
pressed
for
an
answer
i
should
have
said
oddly
enough
i
was
thinking
only
yesterday
that
it
was
fair
to
keep
him
waiting
any
longer
because
because
it
anyhow
now
the
rector
still
could
not
speak
it
was
just
one
bewilderment
but
apparently
jenny
did
not
want
any
comments
that
being
so
she
went
on
serenely
my
conscience
is
clear
anyhow
and
i
must
let
what
i
think
dick
might
say
or
think
affect
me
any
more
than
the
other
things
must
i
jenny
what
are
you
going
to
do
tell
me
father
dear
came
the
high
astonished
voice
i
do
know
i
know
at
all
i
must
think
did
you
think
i
made
up
my
mind
why
how
could
i
of
course
i
should
say
if
i
had
to
answer
now
i
began
the
rector
and
stopped
he
perceived
that
the
situation
could
easily
be
complicated
i
must
just
think
about
it
quietly
went
on
the
girl
and
i
must
write
a
note
to
say
so
father
he
glanced
in
her
direction
father
about
being
fond
of
a
man
need
it
be
well
as
i
was
fond
of
frank
i
do
think
lord
talgarth
could
have
expected
that
could
he
but
if
you
well
get
on
with
a
man
very
well
understand
him
can
stand
up
to
him
without
annoying
him
and
and
care
for
him
really
i
mean
in
such
a
way
that
you
like
being
with
him
very
much
and
look
up
to
him
very
much
in
all
kinds
of
ways
i
very
sorry
to
have
to
talk
like
this
but
whom
am
i
to
talk
to
father
dear
well
if
i
found
i
did
care
for
lord
talgarth
like
that
like
a
sort
of
daughter
or
niece
and
more
than
that
too
would
that
i
do
know
said
the
rector
abruptly
standing
up
i
do
know
you
must
ask
me
you
must
settle
all
that
yourself
she
looked
up
at
him
startled
it
seemed
by
the
change
in
his
manner
father
dear
she
began
with
just
the
faintest
touch
of
pathetic
reproach
in
her
voice
but
he
did
not
appear
moved
by
it
you
must
settle
he
said
you
have
all
the
data
i
have
i
he
stepped
towards
the
door
tell
me
as
soon
as
you
have
decided
he
said
and
went
out
iii
the
little
brown
dog
called
lama
who
in
an
earlier
chapter
once
trotted
across
a
lawn
and
who
had
lately
been
promoted
to
sleeping
upon
bed
awoke
suddenly
that
night
and
growled
a
low
breathy
remonstrance
he
had
been
abruptly
kicked
from
beneath
the
bedclothes
get
off
you
heavy
little
beast
said
a
voice
in
the
darkness
lama
settled
himself
again
with
a
grunt
half
of
comfort
half
of
complaint
off
came
the
voice
again
and
again
his
ribs
were
heaved
at
by
a
foot
he
considered
it
a
moment
or
two
and
even
shifted
nearer
the
wall
still
blind
with
sleep
but
the
foot
pursued
him
and
he
awoke
finally
to
the
conviction
that
it
would
be
more
comfortable
by
the
fire
there
was
a
white
sheepskin
there
he
reflected
as
he
finally
reached
the
ground
a
scratching
was
heard
in
the
corner
and
he
was
instantly
alert
and
the
next
moment
had
fitted
his
nose
like
a
kind
of
pad
deep
into
a
small
in
the
wainscoting
and
was
breathing
long
noisy
sighs
down
into
the
delicious
and
darkness
oh
be
quiet
came
a
voice
from
the
bed
lama
continued
his
investigations
unmoved
and
having
decided
after
one
long
final
blow
that
there
was
to
be
no
sport
returned
to
the
sheepskin
with
that
brisk
independent
air
that
was
so
characteristic
of
him
he
was
completely
awake
now
and
stood
eyeing
the
bed
a
moment
with
the
possibility
in
his
mind
that
his
mistress
was
asleep
again
and
that
by
a
very
gentle
leap
but
a
match
was
struck
abruptly
and
he
lay
down
looking
with
that
appearance
of
extreme
in
his
black
eyes
that
animals
always
wear
at
night
at
his
restless
mistress
he
could
not
quite
understand
what
was
the
matter
first
she
lit
a
candle
took
a
book
from
the
small
table
by
the
bed
and
began
to
read
resolutely
this
continued
till
lama
eyes
began
to
blink
at
the
candle
flame
and
then
he
was
suddenly
aware
that
the
light
was
out
and
the
book
closed
and
all
fallen
back
again
into
the
clear
gray
tones
which
men
call
darkness
he
put
his
head
down
on
his
paws
but
his
eyebrows
rose
now
and
again
as
he
glanced
at
the
bed
then
the
candle
was
lighted
again
after
a
certain
space
of
time
but
this
time
there
was
no
book
opened
instead
his
mistress
took
her
arms
out
of
bed
and
clasped
them
behind
her
head
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
this
was
tiresome
as
the
light
was
in
his
eyes
and
his
body
was
just
inert
enough
with
sleep
to
make
movement
something
of
an
effort
little
by
little
however
his
eyebrows
came
down
remained
down
and
his
eyes
closed
he
awoke
again
at
a
sound
the
candle
was
still
burning
but
his
mistress
had
rolled
over
on
to
her
side
and
seemed
to
be
talking
gently
to
herself
then
she
was
over
again
on
this
side
and
a
minute
later
was
out
of
bed
and
walking
to
and
fro
noiselessly
on
the
soft
carpet
he
watched
her
with
interest
his
eyes
only
following
her
he
had
never
yet
fully
understood
this
mysterious
change
of
aspect
that
took
place
every
night
the
white
thin
dress
the
altered
appearance
of
the
head
and
most
mysterious
of
all
the
two
white
things
that
ought
to
be
feet
but
were
no
longer
hard
and
black
he
had
licked
one
of
them
once
tentatively
and
had
found
that
the
effect
was
that
it
had
curled
up
suddenly
there
had
been
a
sound
as
of
pain
overhead
and
a
swift
slap
had
descended
upon
him
he
was
observing
these
things
now
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
and
his
eyes
moved
with
them
after
a
certain
space
of
time
the
movement
stopped
she
was
standing
still
near
a
carved
desk
important
because
a
mouse
had
once
been
described
sitting
beneath
it
and
she
stood
so
long
that
his
eyes
began
to
blink
once
more
then
there
was
a
rustle
of
paper
being
torn
and
he
was
alert
again
in
a
moment
perhaps
paper
would
be
thrown
for
him
presently
she
came
across
to
the
and
he
was
up
watching
her
hands
while
his
own
short
tail
flickered
three
or
four
times
in
invitation
but
it
was
no
good
the
ball
was
crumpled
up
and
thrown
on
to
the
red
logs
there
was
a
whup
from
the
fire
and
a
flame
shot
up
he
looked
at
this
carefully
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
again
lay
down
to
watch
it
his
mistress
was
standing
quite
still
watching
it
with
him
then
as
the
flame
died
down
she
turned
abruptly
went
straight
back
to
the
bed
got
into
it
drew
the
clothes
over
her
and
blew
the
candle
out
after
a
few
moments
steady
staring
at
the
fire
he
perceived
that
a
part
of
the
ball
of
paper
had
rolled
out
on
to
the
stone
hearth
unburned
he
looked
at
it
for
some
while
wondering
whether
it
was
worth
getting
up
for
certainly
the
warmth
was
delicious
and
the
sheepskin
exquisitely
soft
there
was
no
sound
from
the
bed
a
complete
and
absolute
silence
had
succeeded
to
all
the
restlessness
finally
he
concluded
that
it
was
impossible
to
lie
there
any
longer
and
watch
such
a
crisp
little
roll
of
paper
still
untorn
he
got
up
stepped
delicately
on
to
the
wide
hearth
and
pulled
the
paper
towards
him
with
a
little
scratching
sound
there
was
a
sigh
from
the
bed
and
he
paused
then
he
lifted
it
stepped
back
to
his
warm
place
lay
down
and
placing
his
paws
firmly
upon
the
paper
began
to
tear
scraps
out
of
it
with
his
white
teeth
oh
came
the
weary
voice
from
the
bed
he
paused
considered
then
he
tore
two
more
pieces
but
it
did
not
taste
as
it
should
it
was
a
little
sticky
and
too
stiff
he
stood
up
once
more
turned
round
four
times
and
lay
down
with
a
small
grunt
in
the
morning
the
maid
who
swept
up
the
ashes
swept
up
these
fragments
too
she
noticed
a
wet
scrap
of
a
picture
postcard
with
the
word
selby
printed
in
the
corner
then
she
threw
that
piece
too
into
the
dustpan
chapter
iv
i
partington
and
gertie
had
many
of
those
mysterious
conversations
that
such
women
have
full
of
he
and
she
and
nods
and
becks
and
allusions
and
broken
sentences
wholly
unintelligible
to
the
outsider
yet
packed
with
interest
to
the
talkers
the
major
partington
still
absent
and
frank
were
discussed
continually
and
exhaustively
and
so
far
as
the
subjects
themselves
ranged
there
was
hardly
an
unimportant
detail
that
did
not
come
under
notice
and
hardly
an
important
fact
that
did
gertie
officially
passed
of
course
as
trustcott
always
a
couple
of
mornings
after
frank
had
begun
his
work
at
the
jam
factory
partington
who
had
stepped
round
the
corner
to
talk
with
a
friend
for
an
hour
or
so
returned
to
find
gertie
raging
she
raged
in
her
own
way
she
was
as
white
as
a
sheet
she
uttered
ironical
and
unintelligible
sentences
in
which
frank
name
appeared
repeatedly
and
it
emerged
presently
that
one
of
the
had
been
round
minding
other
folks
business
and
that
gertie
would
thank
that
lady
to
keep
her
airs
and
her
advice
to
herself
now
partington
knew
that
gertie
was
not
the
major
wife
and
gertie
knew
that
she
knew
it
and
partington
knew
that
gertie
knew
that
she
knew
it
yet
officially
all
was
perfectly
correct
gertie
wore
a
and
there
never
was
the
hint
that
she
had
not
a
right
to
it
it
was
impossible
therefore
for
partington
to
observe
out
loud
that
she
understood
perfectly
what
the
had
been
talking
about
she
said
very
little
she
pressed
her
thin
lips
together
and
let
gertie
alone
the
conversations
that
morning
were
of
the
nature
of
disconnected
monologues
from
gertie
with
long
silences
between
it
was
an
afternoon
of
silent
storm
the
major
was
away
in
the
west
end
somewhere
on
mysterious
affairs
the
children
were
at
school
and
the
two
women
went
about
each
knowing
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
other
yet
each
resolved
to
keep
up
appearances
at
five
frank
abruptly
came
in
for
a
cup
of
tea
and
partington
gave
it
him
in
silence
gertie
could
be
heard
moving
about
restlessly
overhead
she
made
one
or
two
ordinary
remarks
watching
frank
when
he
was
not
looking
but
frank
said
very
little
he
sat
up
to
the
table
he
drank
two
cups
of
tea
out
of
the
chipped
enamel
mug
and
then
he
set
to
work
on
his
kippered
herring
at
this
point
partington
left
the
room
as
if
casually
and
a
minute
later
gertie
came
downstairs
she
came
in
with
an
indescribable
air
of
virtue
rather
white
in
the
face
with
her
small
chin
carefully
thrust
out
and
her
eyelids
drooping
it
was
a
pose
she
was
accustomed
to
admire
in
and
aristocratic
barmaids
frank
nodded
at
her
and
uttered
a
syllable
or
two
of
greeting
she
said
nothing
she
went
round
to
the
window
carrying
a
white
cotton
blouse
she
had
been
washing
upstairs
and
hung
it
on
the
that
ran
inside
the
window
then
still
affecting
to
be
busy
with
it
she
fired
her
first
shot
with
her
back
to
him
i
thank
you
to
let
my
business
alone
frank
put
another
piece
of
herring
into
his
mouth
and
not
to
send
round
any
more
of
your
nasty
cats
added
gertie
after
a
pause
there
was
silence
from
frank
well
snapped
gertie
how
dare
you
talk
like
that
said
frank
perfectly
quietly
he
spoke
so
low
that
gertie
mistook
his
attitude
and
leaning
her
hands
on
the
table
she
poured
out
the
torrent
that
had
been
gathering
within
her
ever
since
the
had
left
her
at
eleven
that
morning
the
lady
had
not
been
tactful
she
was
quite
new
to
the
work
and
quite
fresh
from
a
women
college
and
she
had
said
a
great
deal
more
than
she
ought
with
an
earnest
smile
upon
her
face
that
she
had
thought
conciliatory
and
persuasive
gertie
dealt
with
her
faithfully
now
she
sketched
her
character
as
she
believed
it
to
be
she
traced
her
motives
and
her
attitude
to
life
with
an
extraordinary
wealth
of
detail
she
threw
in
descriptive
passages
of
her
personal
appearance
and
she
stated
with
extreme
frankness
her
opinion
of
such
persons
as
she
had
thought
friendly
but
now
discovered
to
be
hypocritical
parsons
in
disguise
unhappily
i
have
not
the
skill
to
transcribe
her
speech
in
full
and
there
are
other
reasons
too
why
her
actual
words
are
best
unreported
they
were
extremely
picturesque
frank
ate
on
quietly
till
he
had
finished
his
herring
then
he
drank
his
last
cup
of
tea
and
turned
a
little
in
his
chair
towards
the
fire
he
glanced
at
the
clock
perceiving
that
he
had
still
ten
minutes
just
as
gertie
ended
and
stood
back
shaking
and
is
that
all
he
asked
it
seemed
it
was
not
all
and
gertie
began
again
this
time
on
a
slightly
higher
note
and
with
a
little
color
in
her
face
frank
waited
quite
simply
and
without
ostentation
she
finished
after
a
moment
pause
frank
answered
i
do
know
what
you
want
he
said
i
talked
to
you
myself
and
you
would
listen
so
i
thought
perhaps
another
woman
would
do
it
better
i
did
listen
i
beg
your
pardon
said
frank
instantly
i
was
wrong
you
did
listen
and
very
patiently
i
meant
that
you
would
do
what
i
said
and
so
i
thought
gertie
burst
out
again
against
cats
and
sneaking
hypocrites
but
there
was
not
quite
the
same
venom
in
her
manner
very
good
said
frank
then
i
wo
make
the
mistake
again
i
am
very
sorry
not
in
the
least
for
having
interfered
you
understand
but
for
not
having
tried
again
myself
he
took
up
his
cap
you
soon
give
in
gertie
you
know
do
you
think
so
yourself
gertie
looked
at
him
in
silence
you
understand
naturally
why
i
ca
talk
to
you
while
the
here
but
the
next
time
i
have
a
chance
the
unlatched
door
was
pushed
open
and
the
major
came
in
ii
there
was
an
uncomfortable
little
pause
for
a
moment
it
is
extremely
doubtful
even
now
exactly
how
much
the
major
heard
but
he
must
have
heard
something
and
to
a
man
of
his
mind
the
situation
that
he
found
must
have
looked
extremely
suspicious
gertie
flushed
now
with
emotion
very
plainly
visible
in
her
bright
eyes
was
standing
looking
at
frank
who
it
appeared
was
a
little
disconcerted
it
would
have
been
almost
miraculous
if
the
major
had
not
been
convinced
that
he
had
interrupted
a
little
private
it
is
rather
hard
to
analyze
the
major
attitude
towards
gertie
but
what
is
certain
is
that
the
idea
of
anyone
else
making
love
to
her
was
simply
intolerable
certainly
he
did
not
treat
her
with
any
great
chivalry
he
made
her
carry
the
heavier
bundles
on
the
tramp
he
behaved
to
her
with
considerable
disrespect
he
discussed
her
freely
with
his
friends
on
convivial
occasions
but
she
was
his
property
his
and
no
one
else
he
had
had
his
suspicions
before
he
had
come
in
quietly
just
now
on
purpose
and
he
had
found
himself
confronted
by
this
very
peculiar
little
scene
he
looked
at
them
both
in
silence
then
his
lips
sneered
like
a
dog
pardon
me
he
said
with
extreme
politeness
i
appear
to
be
interrupting
a
private
conversation
no
one
said
anything
frank
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
mantelpiece
it
was
private
then
continued
the
major
with
all
the
poisonous
courtesy
at
his
command
yes
it
was
private
said
frank
shortly
the
major
put
his
bowler
hat
carefully
upon
the
table
gertie
my
dear
he
said
will
you
be
good
enough
to
leave
us
for
an
instant
i
regret
having
to
trouble
you
gertie
breathed
rather
rapidly
for
a
moment
or
two
she
was
not
altogether
displeased
she
understood
perfectly
and
it
seemed
to
her
rather
pleasant
that
two
men
should
get
into
this
kind
of
situation
over
her
she
was
aware
that
trouble
would
come
to
herself
later
probably
in
the
form
of
personal
chastisement
but
to
the
particular
kind
of
feminine
temperament
that
she
possessed
even
a
beating
was
not
wholly
painful
and
the
cheap
kind
of
drama
in
which
she
found
herself
was
wholly
attractive
after
an
instant
pause
she
cast
towards
frank
what
she
believed
to
be
a
proud
glance
and
marched
out
if
you
got
much
to
say
said
frank
rapidly
as
the
door
closed
you
better
keep
it
for
this
evening
i
got
to
go
in
in
two
minutes
two
minutes
will
be
ample
said
the
major
softly
frank
waited
when
i
find
a
friend
went
on
the
other
engaged
in
an
apparently
exciting
kind
of
conversation
which
he
informs
me
is
private
with
one
who
is
in
the
position
of
my
wife
particularly
when
i
catch
a
sentence
or
two
obviously
not
intended
for
my
ears
i
do
not
ask
what
was
the
subject
of
the
conversation
but
i
my
dear
man
said
frank
do
put
it
more
simply
the
major
was
caught
so
to
speak
full
in
the
wind
his
face
twitched
with
anger
then
he
flung
an
oath
at
frank
if
i
catch
you
at
it
again
he
said
there
be
trouble
god
damn
you
that
is
as
it
may
be
said
frank
the
major
had
had
just
one
drink
too
much
and
he
was
in
the
kind
of
expansive
mood
that
changes
very
rapidly
can
you
tell
me
you
were
not
trying
to
take
her
from
me
he
cried
almost
with
pathos
in
his
voice
this
was
of
course
exactly
what
frank
had
been
trying
to
do
you
ca
deny
it
then
i
tell
you
this
frankie
the
major
sprang
up
one
word
more
from
you
to
her
on
that
subject
and
and
you
know
it
understand
me
he
thrust
his
face
forward
almost
into
frank
it
was
an
unpleasant
face
at
most
times
but
it
was
really
dangerous
now
his
lips
lay
back
and
the
peculiar
hot
smell
of
spirit
breathed
into
frank
nostrils
frank
turned
and
looked
into
his
eyes
i
understand
you
perfectly
he
said
there
no
need
to
say
any
more
and
now
if
you
forgive
me
i
must
get
back
to
my
work
he
took
up
his
cap
and
went
out
the
major
as
has
been
said
had
had
one
glass
too
much
and
he
had
accordingly
put
into
words
what
even
in
his
most
suspicious
moments
he
had
intended
to
keep
to
himself
it
might
be
said
too
that
he
had
put
into
words
what
he
did
not
really
think
but
the
major
was
like
everyone
else
for
good
or
evil
a
complex
character
and
found
it
perfectly
possible
both
to
believe
and
disbelieve
the
same
idea
simultaneously
it
depended
in
what
stratum
the
center
of
gravity
happened
to
be
temporarily
suspended
one
large
part
of
the
major
knew
perfectly
well
therefore
that
any
jealousy
of
frank
was
simply
ridiculous
the
thing
was
simply
alien
and
another
part
not
so
large
but
ten
times
more
concentrated
judged
frank
by
the
standards
by
which
the
major
blackguard
conducted
his
life
for
people
who
lived
usually
in
that
stratum
making
love
to
gertie
under
such
circumstances
would
have
been
an
eminently
natural
thing
to
do
and
just
now
the
major
chose
to
place
frank
amongst
them
the
major
himself
was
completely
unaware
of
these
psychological
distinctions
and
as
he
sat
sunk
in
his
chair
brooding
before
stepping
out
to
attend
to
gertie
he
was
entirely
convinced
that
his
suspicions
were
justified
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
numberless
little
details
out
of
the
past
fitted
with
the
smoothness
of
an
adjusted
puzzle
into
the
framework
of
his
thought
there
was
first
the
very
remarkable
fact
that
frank
in
spite
of
opportunities
to
better
himself
had
remained
in
their
company
at
barham
at
doctor
whitty
at
the
monastery
obvious
chances
had
offered
themselves
and
he
had
not
taken
them
then
there
were
the
small
acts
of
courtesy
the
bearing
of
gertie
bundles
two
or
three
times
finally
there
was
a
certain
change
in
gertie
manner
a
certain
silent
peevishness
towards
himself
a
curious
air
that
fell
on
her
now
and
then
as
she
spoke
to
frank
or
looked
at
him
and
so
forth
it
was
an
extraordinarily
convincing
case
clinched
now
by
the
little
scene
that
he
had
just
interrupted
and
the
very
irregularity
of
his
own
relations
with
gertie
helped
to
poison
the
situation
with
an
astonishingly
strong
venom
of
course
there
were
other
considerations
or
rather
there
was
one
that
frank
obviously
was
not
the
kind
of
man
to
be
attracted
by
the
kind
of
woman
that
gertie
was
a
consideration
made
up
however
of
infinitely
slighter
indications
but
this
counted
for
nothing
it
seemed
unsubstantial
and
shadowy
there
were
solid
definable
arguments
on
the
one
side
there
was
a
vague
general
impression
on
the
other
so
the
major
sat
and
stared
at
the
fire
with
the
falling
on
his
sunken
cheeks
and
the
bristle
on
his
chin
a
poor
fallen
kind
of
figure
yet
still
holding
the
shadow
of
a
shadow
of
an
ideal
that
might
yet
make
him
dangerous
presently
he
got
up
with
a
sudden
movement
and
went
in
search
of
gertie
iii
there
are
no
free
libraries
in
hackney
wick
the
munificences
of
carnegie
have
not
yet
penetrated
to
that
district
and
indeed
the
thought
of
a
library
of
any
kind
in
hackney
wick
is
a
little
incongruous
but
there
is
one
in
homerton
and
during
the
on
the
following
day
frank
went
up
the
steps
of
it
pushed
open
the
and
found
his
way
to
some
kind
of
a
where
he
obtained
a
sheet
of
paper
an
envelope
and
a
penny
stamp
and
sat
down
to
write
a
letter
the
picture
that
i
have
in
my
mind
of
frank
at
this
present
time
may
possibly
be
a
little
incorrect
in
one
or
two
details
but
i
am
quite
clear
about
its
main
outlines
and
it
is
extremely
vivid
on
the
whole
i
see
him
going
in
quietly
and
unostentatiously
quite
at
his
ease
yet
a
very
unusual
figure
in
such
surroundings
i
hear
an
old
gentleman
sniff
and
move
his
chair
a
little
as
this
person
in
an
exceedingly
shabby
blue
suit
with
the
collar
turned
up
with
a
muffler
round
his
neck
and
large
bulging
boots
on
his
feet
comes
and
sits
beside
him
i
perceive
an
earnest
young
lady
probably
a
typist
in
search
of
extra
culture
look
at
him
long
and
vacantly
from
over
her
copy
of
emerson
and
can
almost
see
her
mind
gradually
collecting
conclusions
about
him
the
attendant
too
as
he
asks
for
his
paper
eyes
him
shrewdly
and
suspiciously
and
waits
till
the
three
halfpence
are
actually
handed
across
under
the
brass
wire
partition
before
giving
him
the
penny
stamp
these
circumstances
may
be
incorrect
but
i
am
absolutely
clear
as
to
own
attitude
of
mind
honestly
he
no
longer
minds
in
the
very
least
how
people
behave
to
him
he
has
got
through
all
that
kind
of
thing
long
ago
he
is
not
at
all
to
be
commiserated
it
appears
to
him
only
of
importance
to
get
the
paper
and
to
be
able
to
write
and
post
his
letter
without
interruption
for
frank
has
got
on
to
that
plane
i
know
no
other
word
to
use
though
i
dislike
this
one
when
these
other
things
simply
do
not
matter
we
all
touch
that
plane
sometimes
generally
under
circumstances
of
a
strong
mental
excitement
whether
of
pleasure
or
pain
or
even
annoyance
a
man
with
violent
toothache
or
who
has
just
become
engaged
to
be
married
really
does
not
care
what
people
think
of
him
but
frank
for
the
present
at
least
has
got
here
altogether
though
for
quite
different
reasons
the
letter
he
wrote
on
this
occasion
is
at
present
in
my
possession
it
runs
as
follows
it
is
very
short
and
dear
jack
i
want
to
tell
you
where
i
am
or
rather
where
i
can
be
got
at
in
case
of
need
i
am
down
in
east
london
for
the
present
and
one
of
the
curates
here
knows
where
i
living
he
was
at
eton
with
me
his
address
is
the
rev
the
eton
mission
hackney
wick
london
the
reason
i
writing
is
this
you
remember
major
trustcott
and
gertie
do
you
well
i
have
succeeded
in
getting
gertie
back
to
her
people
yet
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
the
major
knows
that
there
something
up
and
of
course
puts
the
worst
possible
construction
upon
it
knows
all
about
it
too
i
just
left
a
note
on
him
with
instructions
now
i
do
quite
know
what
happen
but
in
case
anything
does
happen
which
prevents
my
going
on
at
gertie
i
want
you
to
come
and
do
what
you
can
will
write
to
you
if
necessary
that
one
thing
and
the
next
is
this
i
rather
like
to
have
some
news
about
my
people
and
for
them
to
know
if
they
want
to
know
i
leave
that
to
you
that
i
getting
on
all
right
i
have
heard
a
word
about
them
since
august
i
know
nothing
particular
can
have
happened
because
i
always
look
at
the
papers
but
i
should
like
to
know
what
going
on
generally
i
think
that
about
all
i
am
getting
on
excellently
myself
and
hope
you
are
i
am
afraid
there
no
chance
of
my
coming
to
you
for
christmas
i
suppose
you
be
home
again
by
now
ever
yours
of
course
you
keep
all
this
private
as
well
as
where
i
living
now
this
letter
seems
to
me
rather
interesting
from
a
psychological
point
of
view
it
is
extremely
but
perfectly
unpractical
frank
states
what
he
wants
but
he
wants
an
absurd
impossibility
i
like
jack
kirkby
very
much
but
i
can
not
picture
him
as
likely
to
be
successful
in
helping
to
restore
a
strayed
girl
to
her
people
i
suppose
frank
only
excuse
is
that
he
did
not
know
whom
else
to
write
to
it
is
rather
interesting
too
to
notice
his
desire
to
know
what
is
going
on
at
his
home
it
seems
as
if
he
must
have
had
some
faint
inkling
that
something
important
was
about
to
happen
and
this
is
interesting
in
view
of
what
now
followed
immediately
he
directed
his
letter
stamped
it
and
posted
it
in
the
library
in
the
vestibule
then
cap
in
hand
he
pushed
open
the
and
ran
straight
into
hullo
said
that
clergyman
and
went
a
little
white
hullo
said
frank
and
then
what
the
matter
where
are
you
going
i
going
back
to
the
jam
factory
may
i
walk
with
you
certainly
if
you
do
mind
my
eating
as
i
go
along
the
clergyman
turned
with
him
and
went
beside
him
in
silence
as
frank
drawing
out
of
his
a
large
hunch
of
bread
and
cheese
wrapped
up
in
the
advertisement
sheet
of
the
began
to
fill
his
mouth
i
want
to
know
if
you
had
any
news
from
home
frank
turned
to
him
slightly
no
he
said
sharply
after
a
pause
licked
his
lips
well
no
it
is
bad
news
but
i
wondered
whether
what
is
it
your
governor
married
again
it
happened
yesterday
i
thought
perhaps
you
did
know
there
was
dead
silence
for
an
instant
no
i
did
know
said
frank
who
he
married
somebody
i
never
heard
of
i
wondered
whether
you
knew
her
what
her
name
wait
a
second
said
the
other
plunging
under
his
greatcoat
to
get
at
his
waistcoat
pocket
i
got
the
paragraph
here
i
cut
it
out
of
the
i
only
saw
it
half
an
hour
ago
i
was
coming
round
to
you
this
evening
he
produced
a
slip
of
printed
paper
frank
stood
still
a
moment
leaning
against
some
they
were
in
the
distinguished
quarter
of
victoria
park
road
and
read
the
paragraph
through
the
clergyman
watched
him
curiously
it
seemed
to
him
a
very
remarkable
situation
that
he
should
be
standing
here
in
victoria
park
road
giving
information
to
a
son
as
to
his
father
marriage
he
wondered
but
only
secondarily
what
effect
it
would
have
upon
frank
frank
gave
him
the
paper
back
without
a
tremor
thanks
very
much
he
said
no
i
did
know
they
continued
to
walk
know
her
at
all
yes
i
know
her
she
the
rector
daughter
you
know
what
at
merefield
then
you
must
know
her
quite
well
oh
yes
said
frank
i
know
her
quite
well
again
there
was
silence
then
the
other
burst
out
look
here
i
wish
you
let
me
do
something
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
ghastly
my
dear
man
said
frank
indeed
you
ca
do
anything
you
got
my
note
did
you
the
clergyman
nodded
it
just
in
case
i
ill
or
anything
you
know
jack
a
great
friend
of
mine
and
it
just
as
well
that
some
friend
of
mine
should
be
able
to
find
out
where
i
am
i
just
written
to
him
myself
as
i
said
in
my
note
but
you
must
give
him
my
address
unless
in
case
of
real
need
all
right
but
are
you
sure
i
perfectly
sure
oh
by
the
way
that
lady
you
sent
round
did
no
good
i
expect
she
told
you
yes
she
said
she
never
come
across
such
a
difficult
case
well
i
shall
have
to
try
again
myself
i
must
turn
off
here
good
luck
iv
gertie
was
sitting
alone
in
the
kitchen
about
nine
that
night
alone
that
is
to
say
except
for
the
sleeping
who
in
a
cot
at
the
foot
of
his
mother
bed
was
almost
invisible
under
a
pile
of
clothes
and
completely
negligible
as
a
witness
partington
with
the
other
two
children
was
paying
a
prolonged
visit
in
mortimer
road
and
the
major
ignorant
of
this
fact
was
talking
big
in
the
bar
of
the
queen
arms
opposite
the
men
club
of
the
eton
mission
gertie
was
enjoying
herself
just
now
on
the
whole
it
is
true
that
she
had
received
some
chastisement
yesterday
from
the
major
but
she
had
the
kind
of
nature
that
preferred
almost
any
sensation
to
none
and
indeed
the
situation
was
full
of
emotion
it
was
extraordinarily
pleasant
to
her
to
occupy
such
a
position
between
two
men
and
above
all
two
gentlemen
her
attitude
towards
the
major
was
of
the
most
simple
and
primitive
kind
he
was
her
man
who
bullied
her
despised
her
dragged
her
about
the
country
and
she
never
for
one
instant
forgot
that
he
had
once
been
an
officer
in
the
army
even
his
blows
which
to
tell
the
truth
were
not
very
frequent
and
were
always
administered
in
a
judicial
kind
of
way
bore
with
them
a
certain
stamp
of
brilliance
she
possessed
a
very
pathetic
capacity
for
snobbishness
frank
on
the
other
side
was
no
less
exciting
she
regarded
him
as
a
good
young
man
almost
romantic
indeed
in
his
goodness
a
kind
of
sir
galahad
and
he
whatever
his
motive
and
she
was
sometimes
terribly
puzzled
about
his
motives
at
any
rate
stood
in
a
sort
of
rivalry
to
the
major
and
it
was
she
who
was
the
cause
of
contention
she
loved
to
feel
herself
pulled
this
way
and
that
by
two
such
figures
to
be
quarreled
over
by
such
very
strong
and
opposite
types
it
was
a
vague
sensation
to
her
but
very
vivid
and
attractive
and
although
just
now
she
believed
herself
to
be
thoroughly
miserable
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
she
was
enjoying
it
all
immensely
she
was
very
feminine
indeed
and
the
little
scene
of
last
night
had
brought
matters
to
an
almost
exquisite
point
she
was
crying
a
little
now
gently
to
herself
the
door
opened
frank
came
in
put
down
his
cap
and
took
his
seat
on
the
bench
by
the
fire
all
out
he
asked
gertie
nodded
and
made
a
little
broken
sound
very
good
said
frank
then
i
going
to
talk
to
you
gertie
wiped
away
a
few
more
tears
and
settled
herself
down
for
a
little
morbid
pleasure
it
was
delightful
to
her
to
be
found
crying
over
the
fire
frank
at
any
rate
would
appreciate
that
now
said
frank
you
got
the
choice
once
more
and
i
going
to
put
it
plainly
if
you
do
do
what
i
want
this
time
i
shall
have
to
see
whether
somebody
else
ca
persuade
you
she
glanced
up
a
little
startled
look
here
said
frank
i
not
going
to
take
any
more
trouble
myself
over
this
affair
you
were
a
good
deal
upset
yesterday
when
the
lady
came
round
and
you
be
more
upset
yet
before
the
thing
over
i
sha
talk
to
you
myself
any
more
you
do
seem
to
care
a
hang
what
i
say
in
fact
i
thinking
of
moving
my
lodgings
after
christmas
so
now
you
got
your
choice
he
paused
on
the
one
side
you
got
the
major
well
you
know
him
you
know
the
way
he
treats
you
but
that
not
the
reason
why
i
want
you
to
leave
him
i
want
you
to
leave
him
because
i
think
that
down
at
the
bottom
you
got
the
makings
of
a
good
woman
i
have
cried
gertie
passionately
well
i
think
you
have
you
very
patient
and
you
very
industrious
and
because
you
care
for
this
man
you
do
simply
anything
in
the
world
for
him
well
that
splendid
that
shows
you
got
grit
but
have
you
ever
thought
what
it
all
be
like
in
five
years
from
now
i
shall
be
dead
wailed
gertie
i
wish
i
was
dead
now
frank
paused
and
when
you
dead
he
said
slowly
there
was
an
instant
silence
then
frank
took
up
his
discourse
again
so
far
he
had
done
exactly
what
he
had
wanted
he
had
dropped
two
tiny
ideas
on
her
heart
once
more
hope
and
fear
now
i
something
to
tell
you
do
you
remember
the
last
time
i
talked
to
you
well

things

written
in
it

gertie

up
white
with
passion

looked
at
my
things

in
the
face

he
said

till

wrote
to

answer

i
wrote
again
and
i
got
another
answer
and
a
letter
for
you
it
came
this
morning
to
the
where
i
got
it
gertie
looked
at
him
still
white
with
her
lips
parted
give
me
the
letter
she
whispered
as
soon
as
i
done
talking
said
frank
serenely
you
got
to
listen
to
me
first
i
knew
what
you
say
you
say
that
your
people
would
have
you
back
and
i
knew
perfectly
well
from
the
little
things
you
said
about
them
that
they
would
but
i
wrote
to
make
sure
gertie

that
they
breaking
their
hearts
for
you
that

nothing
in
the
whole
world
they

much
as

should
come
back

me
the
letter
you
got
a
good
heart

sort
of
life
and
and
well
you

about
the
soul
and
god
do
you
or
to
go
home
and
her
face
shook
all
over
for
one
instant
give
me
the
letter
she
wailed
suddenly
then
frank
gave
it
her
v
but
i
ca
possibly
go
home
like
this
whispered
gertie
agitatedly
in
the
passage
after
the
major
return
half
an
hour
later
good
lord
whispered
frank
what
an
extraordinary
girl
you
are
to
think
i
do
care
i
ca
and
i
wo
frank
cast
an
eye
at
the
door
beyond
which
dozed
the
major
in
the
chair
before
the
fire
well
what
want
i
want
another
dress
and
and
lots
of
things
frank
stared
at
her
resignedly
how
much
will
it
all
come
to
i
do
know
two
pounds
two
pounds
ten
let
see
the
twentieth
we
must
get
you
back
before
christmas
if
i
let
you
have
it
will
it
do
night
she
nodded
a
sound
came
from
beyond
the
door
and
she
fled
i
am
not
sure
about
the
details
of
the
manner
in
which
frank
got
the
two
pounds
ten
but
i
know
he
got
it
and
without
taking
charity
from
a
soul
i
know
that
he
managed
somehow
to
draw
his
week
money
two
days
before
and
for
the
rest
i
suspect
the
pawnshop
what
is
quite
certain
is
that
when
his
friends
were
able
to
take
stock
of
his
belongings
a
little
later
the
list
of
them
was
as
follows
one
jacket
one
shirt
one
muffler
a
pair
of
trousers
a
pair
of
socks
a
pair
of
boots
one
cap
one
and
a
rosary
there
was
absolutely
nothing
else
even
his
razor
was
gone
things
therefore
were
pretty
bad
with
him
on
the
morning
of
the
of
december
i
imagine
that
he
still
possessed
a
few
pence
but
out
of
this
few
pence
he
had
to
pay
for
his
own
and
journey
to
chiswick
as
well
as
keep
himself
alive
for
another
week
at
least
so
he
must
have
thought
it
must
have
been
somewhere
in
kensington
high
street
that
he
first
had
a
hint
of
a
possibility
of
food
to
be
obtained
free
for
although
i
find
it
impossible
to
follow
all
his
movements
during
these
days
it
is
quite
certain
that
he
partook
of
the
hospitality
of
the
carmelite
fathers
on
this
morning
he
mentions
it
with
pleasure
in
his
diary
it
is
a
very
curious
and
medieval
sight
this
feeding
of
the
poor
in
the
little
deep
passage
that
runs
along
the
outside
of
the
cloister
of
the
monastery
in
church
street
the
passage
is
approached
by
a
door
at
the
back
of
the
house
opening
upon
the
lane
behind
and
at
a
certain
hour
on
each
morning
of
the
year
is
thronged
from
end
to
end
with
the
most
astonishing
and
deplorable
collection
of
human
beings
to
be
seen
in
london
they
are
of
all
ages
and
sizes
from
seventeen
to
seventy
and
the
one
thing
common
to
them
all
is
extreme
shabbiness
and
poverty
a
door
opens
at
a
given
moment
the
crowd
surges
a
little
towards
a
man
in
a
brown
frock
with
an
apron
over
it
and
five
minutes
later
a
deep
silence
broken
only
by
the
sound
of
supping
and
swallowing
falls
upon
the
crowd
there
they
stand
with
the
roar
of
london
sounding
overhead
the
hooting
of
cars
the
noise
of
innumerable
feet
and
the
rain
at
least
on
this
morning
falling
dismally
down
the
long
space
and
here
stand
between
two
and
three
hundred
men
pinched
feeble
and
yet
wolfish
gulping
down
hot
soup
and
bread
looking
something
like
a
herd
of
ragged
prisoners
pent
in
between
the
high
walls
here
then
frank
stood
in
the
midst
of
them
gulping
his
soup
his
van
and
horses
strictly
against
orders
remained
in
church
street
under
the
care
of
a
whom
frank
seems
to
have
asked
quite
openly
to
do
it
for
him
for
god
sake
it
is
a
dreary
little
scene
in
which
to
picture
him
and
yet
to
myself
it
is
rather
pleasant
too
i
like
to
think
of
him
now
for
the
second
time
within
a
few
weeks
and
all
within
the
first
six
months
of
his
catholic
life
depending
upon
his
church
for
the
needs
of
the
body
as
well
as
for
the
needs
of
the
soul
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
distinguish
him
from
the
rest
he
too
had
now
something
of
that
lean
look
that
is
such
a
characteristic
of
that
crowd
and
his
dress
too
was
entirely
suitable
to
his
company
he
spoke
with
none
of
his
hosts
he
took
the
basin
in
silence
and
gave
it
back
in
silence
then
he
wiped
his
mouth
on
his
sleeve
and
went
out
comforted
chapter
v
i
dick
guiseley
sat
over
breakfast
in
his
rooms
off
oxford
street
entirely
engrossed
in
a
local
yorkshire
paper
two
days
old
his
rooms
were
very
characteristic
of
himself
they
were
five
in
number
a
two
bedrooms
and
two
divided
by
curtains
as
well
as
a
little
that
opened
on
to
the
landing
close
beside
the
lift
that
served
all
the
flats
they
were
furnished
in
a
peculiarly
restrained
style
so
restrained
in
fact
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
remember
what
was
in
them
one
was
just
conscious
of
a
sense
of
extreme
comfort
and
convenience
there
was
nothing
in
particular
that
arrested
the
attention
or
caught
the
eye
except
here
and
there
a
space
or
a
patch
of
wall
about
which
dick
had
not
yet
made
up
his
mind
he
had
been
in
them
two
years
indeed
but
he
had
not
nearly
finished
furnishing
from
time
to
time
a
new
piece
of
furniture
appeared
or
a
new
picture
always
exceedingly
good
of
its
kind
and
even
conspicuous
yet
somehow
or
other
so
excellent
was
his
taste
as
soon
as
the
thing
was
in
place
its
conspicuousness
so
to
speak
vanished
amidst
the
protective
coloring
and
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
there
for
ever
the
colors
were
chosen
with
the
same
superfine
skill
singly
they
were
brilliant
or
at
least
remarkable
the
ceilings
for
instance
were
of
a
rich
buttercup
yellow
collectively
they
were
subdued
and
unnoticeable
and
i
suppose
this
is
exactly
what
rooms
ought
to
be
the
at
which
he
sat
was
a
good
instance
of
his
taste
the
on
it
was
really
remarkable
there
was
a
delightful
caroline
tankard
in
the
middle
placed
there
for
the
sheer
pleasure
of
looking
at
it
there
was
a
large
silver
cow
with
a
lid
in
its
back
there
were
four
spoons
the
china
was
an
extremely
cheap
venetian
crockery
of
brilliant
designs
and
thick
make
the
and
were
early
georgian
with
very
peculiar
marks
but
these
vessels
were
at
present
hidden
under
the
folded
newspaper
there
were
four
chrysanthemums
in
four
several
vases
of
an
exceptional
kind
of
glass
it
sounds
startling
i
know
but
the
effect
was
not
startling
though
i
can
not
imagine
why
not
here
again
one
was
just
conscious
of
freshness
and
suitability
and
comfort
but
dick
was
taking
no
pleasure
in
it
all
this
morning
he
was
feeling
almost
physically
sick
and
the
little
silver
dish
of
kidneys
on
his
queen
anne
sideboard
was
undisturbed
he
had
cut
off
the
top
of
an
egg
which
was
now
rapidly
cooling
and
a
milky
surface
resembling
thin
ice
was
forming
on
the
contents
of
his
and
meanwhile
he
read
the
column
he
was
reading
described
the
wedding
of
his
uncle
with
miss
jenny
launton
and
journalese
surpassed
itself
there
was
a
great
deal
about
the
fine
old
english
appearance
of
the
bridegroom
who
it
appeared
had
been
married
in
a
black
and
gray
trousers
with
white
spats
and
who
had
worn
a
chrysanthemum
in
his
dick
cast
an
almost
venomous
glance
upon
the
lovely
blossom
just
beside
the
paper
and
the
beautiful
youthful
dignity
of
the
bride
so
popular
among
the
humble
denizens
of
the
the
bride
father
it
seemed
had
officiated
at
the
wedding
in
the
sturdy
old
church
and
had
been
greatly
affected
assisted
by
the
rev
matthieson
the
wedding
it
seemed
had
been
unusually
quiet
and
had
been
celebrated
by
special
license
few
of
the
family
had
been
present
owing
said
the
discreet
reporter
to
the
express
wish
of
the
bridegroom
dick
reflected
sardonically
upon
his
own
convenient
attack
of
influenza
from
which
he
was
now
completely
recovered
then
there
was
a
great
deal
more
about
the
ancient
home
of
the
guiseleys
and
the
aristocratic
appearance
of
viscount
merefield
the
young
and
popular
heir
to
the
earldom
who
it
appeared
had
assisted
at
the
wedding
in
another
black
general
mainwaring
had
acted
as
best
man
finally
there
was
a
short
description
of
the
presents
of
the
bridegroom
to
the
bride
which
included
a
set
of
amethysts
etc
dick
read
it
all
through
to
the
luxuriant
end
down
to
the
peals
of
the
bells
and
the
rejoicings
in
the
evening
he
ate
several
pieces
of
dry
toast
while
he
read
crumbling
them
quickly
with
his
left
hand
and
when
he
had
finished
drank
his
coffee
straight
off
at
one
draught
then
he
got
up
still
with
the
paper
sat
down
in
the
nearest
to
the
fire
and
read
the
whole
thing
through
once
more
then
he
pushed
the
paper
off
his
knee
and
leaned
back
it
would
need
a
complete
psychological
treatise
to
analyze
properly
all
the
emotions
he
had
recently
gone
through
emotions
which
had
been
so
to
say
developed
and
fixed
by
the
newspaper
column
he
had
just
read
he
was
a
man
who
was
accustomed
to
pride
himself
secretly
upon
the
speed
with
which
he
faced
each
new
turn
of
fortune
and
the
correctness
of
the
attitude
he
assumed
perhaps
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
the
artistic
stoic
was
the
ideal
towards
which
he
strove
but
somehow
those
emotions
would
not
sort
themselves
there
they
all
were
fury
indignation
contempt
wounded
pride
resignation
pity
there
were
no
more
to
be
added
or
subtracted
each
had
its
place
and
its
object
yet
they
would
not
coalesce
now
fury
against
his
uncle
now
pity
for
himself
now
a
poisonous
kind
of
contempt
of
jenny
or
again
a
primitive
kind
of
longing
for
jenny
a
disregard
of
his
uncle
an
abasement
of
himself
the
emotions
whirled
and
twisted
and
he
sat
quite
still
with
his
eyes
closed
watching
them
but
there
was
one
more
emotion
which
had
made
its
appearance
entirely
unexpectedly
as
soon
as
he
had
heard
the
news
that
now
greatly
to
his
surprise
was
beginning
to
take
a
considerable
place
amongst
the
rest
and
this
was
an
extraordinarily
warm
sense
of
affection
towards
frank
of
all
people
it
was
composed
partly
of
compassion
and
partly
of
an
inexplicable
sort
of
respect
for
which
he
could
perceive
no
reason
it
was
curious
he
thought
later
why
this
one
figure
should
have
pushed
its
way
to
the
front
just
now
when
his
uncle
and
jenny
and
secondarily
that
rector
so
visibly
affected
by
the
ceremony
should
have
occupied
all
the
field
frank
had
never
meant
very
much
to
dick
he
had
stood
for
the
undignified
and
the
boyish
in
the
midst
of
those
other
stately
elements
of
which
merefield
and
indeed
all
truly
admirable
life
was
composed
yet
now
this
figure
stood
out
before
him
with
startling
distinctness
first
there
was
the
fact
that
both
frank
and
himself
had
suffered
cruelly
at
the
hands
of
the
same
woman
though
frank
incomparably
the
more
cruelly
of
the
two
dick
had
the
honesty
to
confess
that
jenny
had
at
least
never
actually
broken
faith
with
himself
but
he
had
also
the
perspicuity
to
see
that
it
came
to
very
nearly
the
same
thing
he
knew
with
the
kind
of
certitude
that
neither
needs
nor
appeals
to
evidence
that
jenny
would
certainly
have
accepted
him
if
it
had
not
been
that
lord
talgarth
had
already
dawned
on
her
horizon
and
that
she
put
him
off
for
a
while
simply
to
see
whether
this
elderly
sun
would
rise
yet
higher
in
the
heavens
it
was
the
same
consideration
no
doubt
that
had
caused
her
to
throw
frank
over
a
month
or
two
earlier
a
lord
talgarth
in
the
bush
was
worth
two
cadets
in
the
hand
that
was
where
her
sensibleness
had
come
in
and
certainly
it
had
served
her
well
it
was
this
community
of
injury
then
that
primarily
drew
attention
to
frank
and
when
once
it
lead
been
so
drawn
it
lingered
on
other
points
in
his
personality
artistic
stoicism
is
a
very
satisfying
ideal
so
long
as
things
go
tolerably
well
it
affords
an
excellent
protection
against
such
misfortunes
as
those
of
not
being
appreciated
or
of
losing
money
or
just
missing
a
big
position
against
all
such
ills
as
affect
bodily
or
mental
conveniences
but
when
the
heart
is
touched
artistic
stoicism
peels
off
like
rusted
armour
dick
had
seriously
began
to
consider
during
the
last
few
days
whether
the
exact
opposite
of
artistic
stoicism
let
us
call
it
natural
impulsiveness
is
not
almost
as
good
an
equipment
he
began
to
see
something
admirable
in
attitude
to
life
and
the
more
he
regarded
it
the
more
admirable
it
seemed
frank
therefore
had
begun
to
wear
to
him
the
appearance
of
something
really
moving
and
pathetic
he
had
had
a
communication
or
two
from
jack
kirkby
that
had
given
him
a
glimpse
of
what
frank
was
going
through
and
his
own
extremely
artificial
self
was
beginning
to
be
affected
by
it
he
looked
round
his
room
now
once
or
twice
wondering
whether
it
was
all
worth
while
he
had
put
his
whole
soul
into
these
rooms
there
was
that
jacobean
press
with
the
grotesque
heads
ah
how
long
he
had
agonized
over
that
in
the
shop
in
the
king
road
chelsea
wondering
whether
or
not
it
would
do
just
what
he
wanted
in
that
space
between
the
two
doors
there
was
that
small
statue
of
a
tudor
lady
in
a
square
that
he
had
bought
in
oxford
he
had
occupied
at
least
a
week
in
deciding
exactly
from
what
point
she
was
to
smile
on
him
there
was
the
new
curtain
dividing
the
two
rooms
he
had
had
half
a
dozen
patterns
gradually
eliminated
down
to
two
lying
over
his
for
ten
days
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
how
lovely
it
looked
by
the
way
just
now
with
that
patch
of
mellow
london
sunlight
lying
across
the
folds
but
was
it
all
worth
it
he
argued
the
point
with
himself
almost
passively
stroking
his
brown
beard
meditatively
but
the
fact
that
he
could
argue
it
at
all
showed
that
the
foundations
of
his
philosophy
were
shaken
well
then
frank
what
about
him
where
was
he
ii
about
eleven
a
key
turned
in
his
outer
door
and
a
very
came
through
after
tapping
with
a
telegram
on
a
salver
dick
was
writing
to
hamilton
in
berners
street
about
a
question
of
gray
mats
for
the
spare
bedroom
and
he
took
the
telegram
and
tore
open
the
envelope
with
a
preoccupied
air
then
he
uttered
a
small
exclamation
any
answer
sir
no
yes
wait
a
second
he
took
a
with
almost
indecent
haste
addressed
it
to
john
kirkby
barham
yorks
and
wrote
below
will
expect
you
dinner
and
richard
guiseley
then
when
the
boy
had
gone
he
read
again
the
telegram
he
had
received
received
letter
from
frank
can
probably
discover
address
if
i
come
to
town
can
you
put
me
up
jack
kirkby
barham
he
pondered
it
a
minute
or
so
then
he
finished
his
note
to
hamilton
but
it
was
with
a
distracted
manner
then
for
several
minutes
he
walked
up
and
down
his
rooms
with
his
hands
in
his
thinking
very
deeply
he
was
reflecting
how
remarkable
it
was
that
he
should
hear
of
frank
again
just
at
this
time
and
was
wondering
what
the
next
move
of
providence
would
be
the
rest
of
dick
day
was
very
characteristic
of
him
and
considering
my
other
personages
in
this
story
and
their
occupations
i
take
a
dramatic
sort
of
pleasure
in
writing
it
down
he
went
out
to
lunch
with
a
distinguished
lady
of
his
acquaintance
whose
name
i
forbear
to
give
she
was
not
less
than
seventy
years
old
and
the
two
sat
talking
scandal
about
all
their
friends
till
nearly
four
the
talgarth
affair
even
was
discussed
in
all
its
possible
lights
and
dick
was
quite
open
about
his
own
part
in
the
matter
he
knew
this
old
lady
very
well
and
she
knew
him
very
well
she
was
as
shrewd
as
possible
and
extremely
experienced
and
had
helped
dick
enormously
in
various
intricacies
and
troubles
of
the
past
and
he
on
the
other
hand
as
a
bachelor
was
of
almost
equal
service
to
her
she
was
just
the
least
bit
in
the
world
losing
touch
with
things
at
seventy
you
can
not
do
everything
and
dick
helped
to
keep
her
in
touch
he
lunched
with
her
at
least
once
a
week
when
they
were
both
in
town
at
four
he
went
to
the
bath
club
ordered
tea
and
toast
and
cigarettes
and
sat
out
with
his
hat
over
his
eyes
on
the
balcony
watching
the
swimmers
there
was
a
boy
of
sixteen
who
dived
with
surprising
skill
and
dick
took
the
greatest
possible
pleasure
in
observing
him
there
was
also
a
stout
man
of
his
acquaintance
whose
ambition
it
had
been
for
months
to
cross
the
bath
by
means
of
the
swinging
rings
and
this
person
too
afforded
him
hardly
less
pleasure
as
he
always
had
to
let
go
at
the
fourth
ring
if
not
the
third
whence
he
plunged
into
the
water
with
a
sound
that
curiously
enough
was
more
resonant
than
sibilant
at
six
after
looking
through
all
the
illustrated
papers
he
went
out
to
get
his
coat
and
was
presently
in
the
thick
of
a
heated
argument
with
a
member
of
the
committee
on
the
subject
of
the
new
carpet
in
the
front
hall
it
was
not
fit
said
dick
searching
for
hyperboles
for
even
the
of
the
cecil
this
argument
made
him
a
little
later
than
he
had
intended
and
as
he
came
up
in
the
lift
the
attendant
informed
him
in
the
passionless
manner
proper
to
such
people
that
the
kirkby
who
had
been
mentioned
had
arrived
and
was
waiting
for
him
in
his
rooms
iii
shortly
before
midnight
dick
attempted
to
sum
up
the
situation
they
had
talked
about
frank
practically
without
ceasing
since
dick
man
had
set
coffee
on
the
table
at
nine
and
both
had
learned
new
facts
well
then
wire
to
go
down
to
this
man
said
dick
the
first
thing
after
breakfast
do
you
know
anything
about
the
eton
mission
no
one
used
to
have
a
collection
for
it
each
half
you
know
in
the
houses
how
do
we
go
oh
railway
from
broad
street
i
looked
it
up
victoria
park
the
station
dick
drew
two
or
three
draughts
of
smoke
from
his
and
laid
it
down
in
a
small
silver
tray
at
his
elbow
the
tray
was
a
gift
from
the
old
lady
he
had
lunched
with
all
you
told
me
is
extraordinarily
interesting
he
said
it
really
was
to
get
away
this
girl
that
he
stopped
so
long
i
expect
that
what
he
tells
himself
that
the
handle
so
to
speak
but
it
chiefly
a
sort
of
obstinacy
he
said
he
would
go
on
the
roads
and
so
he
gone
i
rather
like
that
you
know
said
dick
jack
snorted
a
little
oh
it
better
than
saying
a
thing
and
not
doing
it
but
why
say
it
oh
one
must
do
something
said
dick
at
least
some
people
seem
to
think
so
and
i
rather
envy
them
you
know
i
afraid
i
do
do
what
do
do
anything
unless
you
can
call
this
sort
of
thing
doing
something
he
waved
his
hand
vaguely
round
his
perfectly
arranged
room
jack
said
nothing
he
was
inclined
to
be
a
little
strenuous
himself
in
some
ways
and
he
had
always
been
conscious
of
a
faint
annoyance
with
dick
extreme
leisureliness
i
see
you
agree
went
on
dick
well
we
must
see
what
can
be
done
he
stood
up
smiling
and
began
to
expand
and
contract
his
fingers
luxuriously
before
the
fire
behind
his
back
if
we
can
only
get
frank
away
murmured
jack
that
enough
for
the
present
and
what
do
you
propose
to
do
with
him
then
oh
lord
anything
go
round
the
world
if
he
likes
come
and
stay
at
my
place
and
suppose
he
thinks
that
a
bit
too
near
to
to
lady
this
switched
jack
back
again
to
a
line
he
had
already
run
on
for
an
hour
this
evening
yes
that
the
ghastly
part
of
it
all
he
sure
not
to
have
heard
and
who
the
devil
to
tell
him
and
how
will
he
take
it
do
you
know
said
dick
i
really
not
frightened
about
that
all
you
told
me
about
him
makes
me
think
he
behave
very
well
funny
thing
is
it
that
you
know
him
so
much
better
than
i
do
i
never
dreamed
there
was
so
much
in
him
somehow
oh
there
a
lot
in
frank
but
one
does
always
know
what
it
is
do
you
think
his
religion
made
much
difference
i
think
it
done
this
for
him
said
jack
slowly
i
been
thinking
a
lot
about
that
i
think
it
fixed
things
so
to
speak
he
hesitated
he
was
not
an
expert
in
psychological
analysis
dick
took
him
up
quickly
he
nodded
three
or
four
times
exactly
he
said
that
it
no
doubt
it
given
him
a
center
a
hub
for
the
wheel
eh
it
it
joined
everything
on
to
one
point
in
him
he
be
more
obstinate
and
mad
than
ever
before
he
got
a
center
now
i
suppose
that
what
religion
for
he
added
meditatively
this
was
greek
to
jack
he
looked
at
dick
uncomprehendingly
dick
turned
round
and
began
to
stare
into
the
fire
still
contracting
and
expanding
his
fingers
it
a
funny
thing
this
religion
he
said
at
last
i
never
could
understand
it
and
what
about
archie
asked
jack
with
sudden
abruptness
he
had
no
continuity
of
mind
dick
brought
his
meditations
to
a
close
with
equal
abruptness
or
perhaps
he
would
not
have
been
so
caustic
as
regards
his
first
cousin
oh
archie
an
ass
he
said
we
can
leave
him
out
jack
changed
the
subject
again
he
was
feeling
the
situation
very
acutely
indeed
and
the
result
was
that
all
its
elements
came
tumbling
out
anyhow
i
been
beastly
uncomfortable
he
said
yes
said
dick
any
particular
way
jack
shifted
one
leg
over
the
other
he
had
not
approached
one
element
in
the
situation
at
all
as
yet
with
dick
but
it
had
been
simmering
in
him
for
weeks
and
had
been
brought
to
a
point
by
frank
letter
received
this
morning
and
now
the
curious
intimacy
into
which
he
had
been
brought
with
dick
began
to
warm
it
out
of
him
you
think
me
an
ass
too
i
expect
he
said
and
i
rather
think
it
true
but
i
ca
help
it
dick
smiled
at
him
encouragingly
certainly
thought
jack
this
man
was
nicer
than
he
had
thought
him
well
it
this
he
said
suddenly
but
it
frightfully
hard
to
put
into
words
you
know
what
i
told
you
about
frank
coming
to
me
at
barham
yes
well
there
was
something
he
said
then
that
made
me
uncomfortable
and
it
made
me
more
and
more
uncomfortable
ever
since
he
paused
again
well
it
this
he
said
that
he
felt
there
was
something
going
on
that
he
could
understand
some
sort
of
plan
he
said
in
which
he
had
to
take
part
a
sort
of
scheme
to
be
worked
out
you
know
i
suppose
he
meant
god
he
explained
feebly
dick
looked
at
him
questioningly
oh
i
ca
put
it
into
words
said
jack
desperately
nor
did
he
exactly
but
that
was
the
kind
of
idea
a
sort
of
fate
he
said
he
was
quite
certain
of
it
and
there
were
lots
of
little
things
that
fitted
in
he
changed
his
clothes
in
the
old
vestry
you
know
in
the
old
church
it
seemed
like
a
sort
of
sacrifice
you
know
and
then
i
had
a
beastly
dream
that
night
and
then
there
was
something
my
mother
said
and
now
there
his
letter
the
one
i
showed
you
at
dinner
about
something
that
might
happen
to
him
oh
i
a
ass
i
there
was
a
considerable
silence
he
glanced
up
in
an
ashamed
sort
of
way
at
the
other
and
saw
him
standing
quite
upright
and
still
again
with
his
back
to
the
fire
looking
out
across
the
room
from
outside
came
the
hum
of
the
thoroughfare
the
rolling
of
wheels
the
jingle
of
bells
the
cries
of
human
beings
he
waited
in
a
kind
of
shame
for
dick
next
words
he
had
not
put
all
these
feelings
into
coherent
form
before
even
to
himself
and
they
sounded
now
even
more
fantastic
than
he
had
thought
them
he
waited
then
for
the
verdict
of
this
quiet
man
whom
up
to
now
he
had
deemed
something
of
a
fool
who
cared
about
nothing
but
billiards
and
what
was
called
art
jack
loathed
art
then
the
verdict
came
in
a
surprising
form
but
he
understood
it
perfectly
well
what
about
bed
said
dick
quietly
iv
it
was
on
the
morning
of
the
that
was
summoned
by
the
neat
of
the
to
see
two
gentlemen
she
presented
two
cards
on
a
plated
salver
inscribed
with
the
names
of
richard
guiseley
and
john
kirkby
he
got
up
very
quickly
and
went
downstairs
two
at
a
time
a
minute
later
he
brought
them
both
upstairs
and
shut
the
door
sit
down
he
said
i
most
awfully
glad
you
come
i
i
been
fearfully
upset
by
all
this
and
i
have
known
what
to
do
now
where
is
he
demanded
jack
kirkby
the
clergyman
made
a
deprecatory
face
i
absolutely
promised
not
to
tell
he
said
and
you
know
but
that
ridiculous
we
come
on
purpose
to
fetch
him
away
it
simply
must
go
on
that
why
i
did
write
i
sent
frank
letter
on
to
guiseley
here
he
a
cousin
of
frank
by
the
way
and
he
asked
me
to
come
up
to
town
i
got
to
town
last
night
and
we
come
down
here
at
once
this
morning
glanced
at
the
neat
bearded
man
who
sat
opposite
but
you
know
i
promised
he
said
yes
burst
in
jack
but
one
does
keep
promises
one
makes
to
madmen
and
but
he
not
mad
in
the
least
he
well
i
was
going
to
say
that
it
seems
to
me
that
he
more
sane
than
anyone
else
said
the
young
man
dismally
i
know
it
sounds
ridiculous
but
dick
guiseley
nodded
with
such
emphasis
that
he
stopped
i
know
what
you
mean
said
dick
in
his
gentle
drawl
and
i
quite
understand
but
it
all
sickening
rot
burst
in
jack
he
must
be
mad
you
know
frank
as
i
do
neither
of
you
and
now
there
this
last
business
his
father
marriage
i
mean
and
he
broke
off
and
looked
across
at
dick
go
on
said
dick
do
mind
me
well
we
do
know
whether
he
heard
of
it
or
not
but
he
must
hear
sooner
or
later
and
then
but
he
has
heard
of
it
interrupted
the
clergyman
i
showed
him
the
paragraph
myself
he
heard
of
it
and
he
knows
all
about
it
certainly
and
i
understood
from
him
that
he
knew
the
girl
the
rector
daughter
is
it
knows
the
girl
why
he
was
engaged
to
her
himself
yes
did
he
tell
you
he
did
give
me
the
faintest
hint
how
did
he
behave
what
did
he
say
stared
a
moment
in
silence
what
did
he
say
snapped
out
jack
impatiently
say
he
said
nothing
he
just
told
me
he
knew
the
girl
when
i
asked
him
good
god
remarked
jack
and
there
was
silence
dick
broke
it
well
it
seems
to
me
we
rather
in
a
hole
but
it
preposterous
burst
out
jack
again
here
poor
old
frank
simply
breaking
his
heart
and
here
are
we
perfectly
ready
to
do
anything
we
can
why
the
chap
must
be
in
hell
look
here
said
dick
softly
what
about
your
going
round
to
his
house
and
seeing
if
he
in
and
what
he
likely
to
be
doing
he
be
at
the
factory
till
this
evening
the
factory
yes
he
working
at
a
jam
factory
just
now
a
sound
of
fury
and
disdain
broke
from
jack
well
continued
dick
may
i
take
a
cigarette
by
the
way
why
should
you
go
round
and
make
inquiries
and
find
out
how
the
land
lies
then
kirkby
and
i
might
perhaps
hang
about
a
bit
and
run
up
against
him
if
you
just
give
us
a
hint
you
know
the
other
looked
at
him
a
moment
well
perhaps
i
might
he
said
doubtfully
but
what
good
lord
but
you
be
keeping
your
promise
wo
you
after
all
it
quite
natural
we
should
come
down
after
his
letter
and
quite
on
the
cards
that
we
should
run
up
against
him
please
to
go
at
once
and
let
us
wait
here
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
came
back
quickly
into
the
room
and
shut
the
door
yes
he
at
the
factory
he
said
or
at
any
rate
he
not
at
home
and
they
do
expect
him
back
till
late
well
there
something
up
the
girl
gone
too
no
she
not
at
the
factory
and
i
think
there
going
to
be
trouble
chapter
vi
i
the
electric
train
slowed
down
and
stopped
at
the
hammersmith
terminus
and
there
was
the
usual
rush
for
the
doors
come
on
gertie
said
a
young
man
here
we
are
the
girl
remained
perfectly
still
with
her
face
hidden
the
crowd
was
enormous
this
christmas
eve
and
for
the
most
part
laden
with
parcels
the
platforms
surged
with
folk
and
each
bookstall
blazing
with
lights
for
it
was
after
seven
was
a
center
of
a
kind
of
whirlpool
there
was
sensational
news
in
the
evening
papers
and
everyone
was
anxious
to
get
at
the
full
details
of
which
the
main
facts
were
tantalizingly
displayed
on
the
posters
everyone
wanted
to
know
exactly
who
were
the
people
concerned
and
how
it
had
all
happened
it
was
a
delightful
tragedy
for
the
christmas
festivities
come
on
said
the
young
man
again
they
nearly
all
out
i
ca
moaned
the
girl
frank
took
her
by
the
arm
resolutely
come
he
said
then
she
came
and
the
two
passed
out
together
into
the
mob
waiting
to
come
in
we
shall
have
to
walk
said
frank
i
sorry
but
i
got
to
get
home
somehow
she
bowed
her
head
and
said
nothing
gertie
presented
a
very
unusual
appearance
this
evening
certainly
she
had
laid
out
the
to
advantage
she
was
in
a
perfectly
decent
dark
dress
with
a
red
stripe
in
it
she
had
a
large
hat
and
some
species
of
boa
round
her
neck
she
even
carried
a
cheap
umbrella
with
a
sham
silver
band
and
a
small
with
one
inside
it
and
to
her
own
mind
no
doubt
she
was
a
perfect
picture
of
the
ideal
penitent
very
respectable
and
even
prosperous
looking
and
yet
with
a
dignified
reserve
she
was
not
at
all
flaunting
she
must
have
thought
neither
was
she
externally
anything
of
a
disgrace
it
would
be
evident
presently
to
her
mother
that
she
had
returned
out
of
simple
goodness
of
heart
and
not
at
all
because
her
recent
escapade
had
been
a
failure
she
would
still
be
able
to
talk
of
the
major
with
something
of
an
air
and
to
make
out
that
he
treated
her
always
like
a
lady
when
i
went
to
interview
her
a
few
months
ago
i
found
her
very
dignified
very
excessively
refined
and
faintly
reminiscent
of
fallen
splendor
and
her
mother
told
me
privately
that
she
was
beginning
to
be
restless
again
and
talked
of
going
on
to
the
stage
but
there
is
one
thing
that
i
find
it
very
hard
to
forgive
and
that
is
that
as
the
two
went
together
under
the
flaming
white
lights
towards
chiswick
high
street
she
turned
to
frank
a
little
nervously
and
asked
him
if
he
would
mind
walking
just
behind
her
please
remember
however
in
extenuation
that
gertie
new
pose
was
that
of
the
superior
young
lady
i
do
quite
like
to
be
seen
murmured
this
respectable
person
oh
certainly
said
frank
without
an
instant
hesitation
they
had
met
half
an
hour
before
by
appointment
at
the
entrance
to
the
underground
station
at
victoria
frank
would
he
calculated
bring
him
there
about
six
and
strictly
against
the
orders
of
his
superiors
but
very
ingeniously
with
the
connivance
of
his
of
the
van
he
had
arranged
for
his
place
to
be
taken
on
the
van
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
by
a
man
known
to
his
but
just
now
out
of
work
for
the
sum
of
one
shilling
to
be
paid
within
a
week
he
was
quite
determined
not
to
leave
gertie
alone
again
when
once
the
journey
to
chiswick
had
actually
begun
until
he
had
seen
her
landed
in
her
own
home
the
place
of
meeting
too
had
suited
gertie
very
well
she
had
left
turner
road
abruptly
without
a
word
to
anyone
the
instant
that
the
major
back
had
been
seen
by
her
to
pass
within
the
of
the
queen
arms
for
his
usual
morning
refreshment
then
she
had
occupied
herself
chiefly
by
collecting
her
various
things
at
their
respective
shops
purchased
by
frank
and
putting
them
on
she
had
had
a
clear
threepence
to
spare
beyond
the
few
shillings
she
had
determined
to
put
by
out
of
the
total
and
had
expended
it
by
a
visit
to
the
cinematograph
show
in
victoria
street
there
had
been
a
very
touching
series
of
pictures
of
the
old
home
in
the
country
and
the
milking
of
the
cows
with
a
general
atmosphere
of
roses
and
and
gertie
had
dissolved
into
tears
more
than
once
and
had
cried
noiselessly
into
her
new
drawn
from
her
new
but
she
had
met
frank
quite
punctually
for
indeed
she
had
burned
her
boats
now
entirely
and
there
was
nothing
else
left
for
her
to
do
at
the
entrance
to
chiswick
high
street
another
brilliant
thought
struck
her
she
paused
for
frank
to
come
up
frankie
she
said
you
wo
say
anything
about
the
will
you
i
should
like
them
to
think
of
course
not
said
frank
gravely
and
after
a
moment
noticing
that
she
glanced
at
him
again
uneasily
understood
and
fell
obediently
to
the
rear
once
more
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
further
on
her
steps
began
to
go
slower
frank
watched
her
very
carefully
he
was
not
absolutely
sure
of
her
even
now
then
she
crossed
over
the
street
between
two
trams
and
frank
dodged
after
her
then
she
turned
as
if
to
walk
back
to
hammersmith
in
an
instant
frank
was
at
her
side
you
going
the
wrong
way
he
said
she
stopped
irresolutely
and
had
to
make
way
for
two
or
three
hurrying
people
to
pass
oh
frankie
i
ca
she
wailed
softly
come
said
frank
and
took
her
by
the
arm
once
more
five
minutes
later
they
stood
together
down
a
certain
long
lane
that
turns
out
of
chiswick
high
street
to
the
left
and
there
for
the
first
time
she
seems
to
have
been
genuinely
frightened
the
street
was
quite
empty
the
entire
walking
population
was
parading
up
and
down
the
thoroughfare
a
hundred
yards
behind
them
or
feverishly
engaged
in
various
kinds
of
provision
shops
the
lamps
were
sparse
in
this
lane
and
all
was
comparatively
quiet
oh
frankie
she
moaned
again
i
ca
i
ca
i
dare
she
leaned
back
against
the
sill
of
a
window
yet
even
then
i
believe
she
was
rather
enjoying
herself
it
was
all
so
extremely
like
the
sort
of
plays
over
which
she
had
been
accustomed
to
shed
tears
the
prodigal
return
and
on
christmas
eve
it
only
required
a
little
snow
to
be
falling
and
a
crying
infant
at
her
breast
i
wonder
what
frank
made
of
it
he
must
have
known
gertie
thoroughly
well
by
now
and
certainly
there
is
not
one
sensible
man
in
a
thousand
whose
gorge
would
not
have
risen
at
the
situation
yet
i
doubt
whether
frank
paid
it
much
attention
where
the
house
he
said
he
glanced
up
at
the
number
of
the
door
by
which
he
stood
it
must
be
a
dozen
doors
further
on
he
said
it
the
last
house
in
the
row
murmured
gertie
in
a
weak
voice
is
father
looking
out
go
and
see
my
dear
girl
said
frank
do
not
be
silly
do
remember
your
letter
then
she
suddenly
turned
on
him
and
if
ever
she
was
genuine
she
was
in
that
moment
frankie
she
whispered
why
not
take
me
away
yourself
oh
take
me
away
take
me
away
he
looked
into
her
eyes
for
an
instant
and
in
that
instant
he
caught
again
that
glimpse
as
of
jenny
herself
take
me
away
i
live
with
you
just
as
you
like
she
took
him
by
his
poor
old
you
can
easily
make
enough
and
i
do
ask
then
he
detached
her
fingers
and
took
her
gently
by
the
arm
come
with
me
he
said
no
not
another
word
together
in
silence
they
went
the
few
steps
that
separated
them
from
the
house
there
was
a
little
garden
in
front
its
borders
set
alternately
with
and
flints
at
the
gate
she
hesitated
once
more
but
he
unlatched
the
gate
and
pushed
her
gently
through
oh
my
gloves
whispered
gertie
in
a
sharp
tone
of
consternation
i
left
them
in
the
shop
next
the
in
wilton
road
frank
nodded
then
still
urging
her
he
brought
her
up
to
the
door
and
tapped
upon
it
there
were
footsteps
inside
god
bless
you
gertie
be
a
good
girl
i
wait
in
the
road
for
ten
minutes
so
that
you
can
call
me
if
you
want
to
then
he
was
gone
as
the
door
opened
ii
the
next
public
appearance
of
frank
that
i
have
been
able
to
trace
was
in
westminster
cathedral
now
it
costs
an
extra
penny
at
least
i
think
to
break
one
journey
from
hammersmith
to
broad
street
and
i
imagine
that
frank
would
not
have
done
this
after
what
he
had
said
to
gertie
about
the
difficulty
connected
with
taking
an
omnibus
except
for
some
definite
reason
so
it
is
only
possible
to
conclude
that
he
broke
his
journey
at
victoria
in
an
attempt
to
get
at
those
gloves
it
seems
almost
incredible
that
gertie
should
have
spoken
of
her
gloves
at
such
a
moment
but
it
really
happened
she
told
me
so
herself
and
personally
on
thinking
over
it
it
seems
to
me
tolerably
in
line
though
perhaps
the
line
is
rather
unusually
prolonged
with
all
that
i
have
been
able
to
gather
about
her
whole
character
the
fact
is
that
gloves
just
then
were
to
her
really
important
she
was
about
to
appear
on
the
stage
of
family
life
and
she
had
formed
a
perfectly
consistent
conception
of
her
part
gloves
were
an
integral
part
of
her
costume
they
were
the
final
proof
of
a
sort
of
opulence
and
refinement
therefore
though
she
could
not
get
them
just
then
it
was
perfectly
natural
and
proper
of
her
to
mention
them
it
must
not
be
thought
that
gertie
was
insincere
she
was
not
she
was
dramatic
and
it
is
a
fact
that
within
five
minutes
of
her
arrival
she
was
down
on
her
knees
by
her
mother
with
her
face
hidden
in
her
mother
lap
crying
her
heart
out
by
the
time
she
remembered
frank
and
ran
out
into
the
street
he
had
been
gone
more
than
twenty
minutes
one
of
the
priests
attached
to
westminster
cathedral
happened
to
have
a
pause
about
nine
in
his
hearing
of
confessions
he
had
been
in
his
box
without
a
break
from
six
and
he
was
extremely
tired
and
stiff
about
the
knees
he
had
said
the
whole
of
his
office
during
intervals
and
he
thought
he
would
take
a
little
walk
up
and
down
the
south
aisle
to
stretch
his
legs
so
he
unlatched
the
little
door
of
his
confessional
leaving
the
light
burning
in
case
someone
else
turned
up
he
slipped
off
his
stole
and
came
outside
the
whole
aisle
it
seemed
was
empty
though
there
was
still
a
sprinkling
of
folks
in
the
north
aisle
right
across
the
great
space
of
the
nave
and
he
went
down
the
whole
length
down
to
the
west
end
to
have
a
general
look
up
the
cathedral
he
stood
looking
for
three
or
four
minutes
overhead
hung
the
huge
span
of
brickwork
lost
in
darkness
incredibly
vast
and
mysterious
with
here
and
there
emerging
into
faint
light
a
slice
of
a
dome
or
the
slope
of
some
dogmas
from
impenetrable
mystery
before
him
lay
the
immense
nave
thronged
now
with
chairs
in
readiness
for
the
midnight
mass
and
they
seemed
to
him
as
he
looked
with
tired
eyes
almost
like
the
bent
shoulders
of
an
enormous
crowd
bowed
in
dead
silence
of
adoration
but
there
was
nothing
yet
to
adore
except
up
there
to
the
left
where
a
very
pale
glimmer
shone
on
polished
marble
among
the
shadows
before
the
chapel
of
the
blessed
sacrament
there
was
one
other
exception
for
overhead
against
the
apse
where
a
belated
sacristan
still
moved
about
himself
a
shadow
busy
with
the
last
preparations
of
the
high
altar
there
burgeoned
out
the
ominous
silhouette
of
the
vast
hanging
cross
but
so
dark
that
the
tortured
christ
upon
it
was
invisible
yet
surely
that
was
right
on
this
night
for
who
of
all
those
who
were
to
adore
presently
the
child
of
joy
gave
a
thought
to
the
man
of
sorrows
his
time
was
yet
three
months
away
as
the
priest
stood
there
looking
and
imagining
with
that
strange
clarity
of
mind
and
intuition
that
a
few
hours
in
the
confessional
gives
to
even
the
dullest
brain
he
noticed
the
figure
of
a
man
detach
itself
from
one
of
the
lighted
confessionals
on
the
left
and
come
down
towards
him
walking
quickly
and
lightly
to
his
surprise
this
young
man
instead
of
going
out
at
the
northwest
door
wheeled
and
came
towards
him
he
noticed
him
particularly
and
remembered
his
dress
afterwards
it
was
a
very
shabby
dark
blue
suit
splashed
with
mud
from
the
christmas
streets
very
bulgy
about
the
knees
the
coat
was
buttoned
up
tightly
round
a
muffler
that
had
probably
once
been
white
and
his
big
boots
made
a
considerable
noise
as
he
came
the
priest
had
a
sudden
impulse
as
the
young
man
crossed
him
a
merry
christmas
he
said
the
young
man
stopped
a
moment
and
smiled
all
over
his
face
and
the
priest
noticed
the
extraordinary
serenity
and
pleasantness
of
the
face
and
that
though
it
was
the
face
of
a
poor
man
with
sunken
cheeks
and
lines
at
the
corners
of
the
mouth
thank
you
father
he
said
the
same
to
you
then
he
went
on
his
boots
as
noisy
as
ever
and
turned
up
the
south
aisle
and
presently
the
sound
of
his
boots
ceased
the
priest
still
stood
a
moment
or
two
looking
and
thinking
and
it
struck
him
with
something
of
pleasure
that
the
young
man
though
obviously
of
the
most
completely
submerged
tenth
had
not
even
hesitated
or
paused
still
less
said
one
word
with
the
hope
of
a
little
something
for
christmas
sake
surely
he
had
spoken
too
with
the
voice
of
an
educated
man
he
became
suddenly
interested
he
scarcely
knew
why
and
the
impression
made
just
by
that
single
glimpse
of
a
personality
deepened
every
moment
what
in
the
world
was
that
young
man
doing
here
what
was
his
business
up
in
that
empty
south
aisle
who
was
he
what
was
it
all
about
he
thought
presently
that
he
would
go
up
and
see
it
was
on
his
way
back
to
the
too
but
when
he
reached
the
corner
of
the
aisle
and
could
see
up
it
there
seemed
to
be
no
one
there
he
began
to
walk
up
wondering
more
than
ever
and
then
on
a
sudden
he
saw
a
figure
kneeling
on
the
lower
step
of
the
chapel
on
the
right
railed
off
and
curtained
now
where
the
crib
was
ready
to
be
disclosed
two
hours
later
it
all
seemed
very
odd
he
could
not
understand
why
anyone
should
wish
to
pray
before
an
impenetrable
curtain
as
he
came
nearer
he
saw
it
was
his
friend
all
right
those
boots
were
unmistakable
the
young
man
was
kneeling
on
the
step
quite
upright
and
motionless
his
cap
held
in
his
hands
facing
towards
the
curtain
behind
which
no
doubt
there
stood
the
stable
with
the
three
personages
an
old
man
a
maid
and
a
child
but
their
time
too
was
not
yet
it
was
two
hours
away
priests
do
not
usually
stare
in
the
face
of
people
who
are
saying
their
prayers
they
are
quite
accustomed
to
that
phenomenon
but
this
priest
he
tells
me
simply
could
not
resist
it
and
as
he
passed
on
his
noiseless
shoes
noticing
that
the
light
from
his
own
confessional
shone
full
upon
the
man
he
turned
and
looked
straight
at
his
face
now
i
do
not
understand
what
it
was
that
he
saw
he
does
not
understand
it
himself
but
it
seems
that
there
was
something
that
impressed
him
more
than
anything
else
that
he
had
ever
seen
before
or
since
in
the
whole
world
the
young
man
eyes
were
open
and
his
lips
were
closed
not
one
muscle
of
his
face
moved
so
much
for
the
physical
facts
but
it
was
a
case
where
the
physical
facts
are
supremely
unimportant
at
any
rate
the
priest
could
only
recall
them
with
an
effort
the
point
was
that
there
was
something
there
personally
i
should
call
it
supernatural
that
stabbed
the
watcher
heart
clean
through
with
one
over
whelming
pang
i
think
that
enough
when
the
priest
reached
the
lady
chapel
he
sat
down
still
trembling
a
little
and
threw
all
his
attention
into
his
ears
determined
to
hear
the
first
movement
that
the
kneeling
figure
made
behind
him
so
he
sat
minute
after
minute
the
cathedral
was
full
of
echoes
murmurous
rebounds
of
the
noises
of
the
streets
drawn
out
and
mellowed
into
long
soft
rolling
tones
against
which
as
against
a
foil
there
stood
out
detached
now
and
then
the
sudden
footsteps
of
someone
leaving
or
entering
a
confessional
the
short
scream
of
a
slipping
chair
once
the
sudden
noise
of
a
being
opened
and
the
click
of
the
handle
which
turned
out
the
electric
light
and
it
was
full
of
shadows
too
a
monstrous
outline
crossed
and
recrossed
the
apse
behind
the
high
altar
as
the
sacristan
moved
about
once
a
hand
as
of
a
giant
remained
poised
for
an
instant
somewhere
on
the
wall
beside
the
throne
it
seemed
to
the
priest
tired
and
as
he
was
as
if
he
sat
in
some
place
of
expectation
some
great
cavern
where
mysteries
moved
and
passed
in
preparation
for
a
climax
all
was
hushed
and
confused
yet
alive
and
the
dark
waves
would
break
presently
in
the
glory
of
the
midnight
mass
he
scarcely
knew
what
held
him
there
nor
what
it
was
for
which
he
waited
he
thought
of
the
lighted
at
the
end
of
the
long
corridor
beyond
the
sacristy
he
wondered
who
was
there
perhaps
one
or
two
were
playing
billiards
and
smoking
they
had
had
a
hard
day
of
it
and
would
scarcely
get
to
bed
before
three
and
yet
here
he
sat
tired
and
yet
waiting
waiting
for
a
young
man
in
a
dirty
suit
and
muffler
and
big
boots
to
give
over
praying
before
a
curtain
in
an
empty
aisle
a
figure
presently
came
softly
round
the
corner
behind
him
it
was
the
priest
whom
he
had
heard
leaving
his
confessional
just
now
have
you
done
yet
whispered
the
pausing
behind
his
chair
coming
in
a
minute
or
two
he
said
the
figure
passed
on
presently
a
door
banged
like
muffled
thunder
somewhere
beyond
the
sacristy
and
simultaneously
he
heard
a
pair
of
boots
going
down
the
aisle
behind
he
got
up
instantly
and
with
long
silent
steps
made
his
way
down
the
aisle
also
the
figure
wheeled
the
corner
and
disappeared
he
himself
ran
on
and
was
in
time
to
see
him
turning
away
from
the
basin
by
the
door
but
he
came
so
quickly
after
him
that
the
door
was
still
vibrating
as
he
put
his
hand
upon
it
he
came
out
more
cautiously
through
the
little
entrance
and
stood
on
the
steps
in
time
to
see
the
young
man
moving
off
not
five
yards
away
in
the
direction
of
victoria
street
but
here
something
stopped
him
coming
straight
up
the
pavement
outside
the
art
and
book
company
depot
was
a
newsboy
at
the
trot
yelling
something
as
he
came
with
a
poster
flapping
from
one
arm
and
a
bundle
of
papers
under
the
other
the
priest
could
not
catch
what
he
said
but
he
saw
the
young
man
suddenly
stop
and
then
turn
off
sharply
towards
the
boy
and
he
saw
him
after
fumbling
in
his
pocket
produce
a
halfpenny
and
a
paper
pass
into
his
hands
there
then
he
stood
motionless
on
the
pavement
the
sheet
spread
before
him
flapping
a
little
in
the
gusty
night
wind
paper
sir
yelled
the
boy
pausing
in
the
road
the
priest
nodded
but
he
was
not
thinking
much
about
the
paper
and
produced
his
halfpenny
the
paper
was
put
into
his
hand
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
it
he
was
still
watching
the
motionless
figure
on
the
pavement
about
three
minutes
passed
then
the
young
man
suddenly
and
dexterously
folded
the
paper
folded
it
again
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
then
he
set
off
walking
and
a
moment
later
had
vanished
round
the
corner
into
victoria
street
the
priest
thought
no
more
of
the
paper
as
he
went
back
through
the
cathedral
wondering
again
over
what
he
had
seen
but
the
was
empty
when
he
got
to
it
and
presently
he
spread
the
paper
before
him
on
the
table
and
leaned
over
it
to
see
what
the
excitement
was
about
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
what
the
news
was
there
were
headlines
occupying
nearly
a
third
of
a
column
but
it
appeared
to
him
unimportant
as
general
news
he
had
never
heard
of
the
people
before
it
seemed
that
a
wealthy
peer
who
lived
in
the
north
of
england
who
had
only
recently
been
married
for
the
second
time
had
been
killed
in
a
motor
smash
together
with
his
eldest
son
the
chauffeur
had
escaped
with
a
fractured
thigh
the
peer
name
was
lord
talgarth
chapter
vii
i
on
the
morning
of
the
a
curious
little
incident
happened
i
dug
the
facts
out
of
the
police
news
in
a
small
on
the
outskirts
of
south
london
obviously
it
is
no
more
than
the
sheerest
coincidence
four
men
were
drinking
a
friendly
glass
of
beer
together
on
their
way
back
to
work
from
breakfast
their
ecclesiastical
zeal
seems
to
have
been
peculiarly
strong
for
they
distinctly
stated
that
they
were
celebrating
christmas
on
that
date
and
i
deduce
from
that
statement
that
was
comparatively
infrequent
with
them
however
as
they
were
about
to
part
there
entered
to
them
a
fifth
and
tired
who
sat
down
and
demanded
some
stronger
form
of
stimulant
the
was
known
to
these
four
for
his
name
was
given
and
his
domicile
was
mentioned
as
hackney
wick
he
was
a
small
man
very
active
and
very
silent
and
rather
pale
and
he
seems
to
have
had
something
of
a
mysterious
reputation
even
among
his
friends
and
to
be
considered
a
dangerous
man
to
cross
he
made
no
mystery
however
as
to
where
he
had
come
from
nor
whither
he
was
going
he
had
come
from
kent
he
said
and
humorously
added
that
he
had
been
and
was
going
to
join
his
wife
and
the
family
circle
for
the
festival
of
christmas
he
remarked
that
his
wife
had
written
to
him
to
say
she
had
lodgers
the
four
men
naturally
stayed
a
little
to
hear
all
this
news
and
to
celebrate
christmas
once
more
but
they
presently
were
forced
to
tear
themselves
away
it
was
as
the
first
man
was
leaving
his
foreman
appears
to
have
been
of
a
tyrannical
disposition
that
the
little
incident
happened
why
he
said
bill
three
out
of
the
five
companions
seemed
to
have
been
usually
called
bill
bill
your
boots
are
in
a
mess
the
bill
in
question
made
caustic
remarks
he
observed
that
it
would
be
remarkable
if
they
were
not
in
such
weather
but
the
other
persisted
that
this
was
not
mud
and
a
general
inspection
was
made
this
resulted
in
the
opinion
of
the
majority
being
formed
that
bill
had
trodden
in
some
blood
bill
himself
was
one
of
the
majority
though
he
attempted
in
vain
to
think
of
any
explanation
two
men
however
declared
that
in
their
opinion
it
was
only
red
earth
a
certain
obscurity
appears
in
the
evidence
at
this
point
owing
to
the
common
use
of
a
certain
expletive
in
the
mouth
of
the
british
there
was
a
hot
discussion
on
the
subject
and
the
bill
whose
boots
were
under
argument
seems
to
have
been
the
only
man
to
keep
his
head
he
argued
very
sensibly
that
if
the
stains
were
those
of
blood
then
he
must
have
stepped
in
some
perhaps
in
the
gutter
of
a
and
if
it
was
not
blood
then
it
must
be
something
else
he
had
trodden
in
it
was
urged
upon
him
that
it
was
best
washed
off
and
he
seems
finally
to
have
taken
the
advice
though
without
enthusiasm
then
the
four
men
departed
the
landlady
evidence
was
to
the
same
effect
she
states
that
the
with
whose
name
she
had
been
previously
unacquainted
though
she
knew
his
face
had
remained
very
tranquilly
for
an
hour
or
so
and
had
breakfasted
off
bacon
and
eggs
he
seemed
to
have
plenty
of
money
she
said
he
had
finally
set
off
limping
a
little
in
a
northward
direction
now
this
incident
is
a
very
small
one
i
only
mention
it
because
in
reading
the
evidence
later
i
found
myself
reminded
of
a
parallel
incident
recorded
in
a
famous
historical
trial
in
which
something
resembling
blood
was
seen
on
the
hand
of
the
judge
his
name
was
ayloff
and
his
date
the
sixteenth
century
ii
partington
had
a
surprise
not
wholly
agreeable
on
that
christmas
eve
for
at
three
just
as
the
london
evening
was
beginning
to
close
in
her
husband
walked
into
the
kitchen
she
had
seen
nothing
of
him
for
six
weeks
and
had
managed
to
get
on
fairly
well
without
him
i
am
not
even
now
certain
whether
or
no
she
knows
what
her
husband
occupation
is
during
these
absences
of
his
i
think
it
quite
possible
that
honestly
she
does
not
and
i
have
no
idea
myself
it
seemed
however
this
time
that
he
had
prospered
he
was
in
quite
a
good
temper
he
was
tolerably
well
dressed
and
within
ten
minutes
of
his
arrival
he
had
produced
a
handful
of
shillings
five
of
these
he
handed
over
to
her
at
once
for
christmas
necessaries
and
ten
more
he
entrusted
to
maggie
with
explicit
directions
as
to
their
expenditure
while
he
took
off
his
boots
his
wife
gave
him
the
news
first
as
to
the
arrival
of
the
major
little
party
and
next
as
to
its
unhappy
dispersion
on
that
very
day
he
will
it
as
the
young
man
gone
off
with
the
young
woman
she
observed
partington
made
a
commentatory
sound
an
mad
she
added
means
mischief
if
can
manage
it
partington
observed
in
his
own
particular
kind
of
vocabulary
that
the
major
intentions
were
absurd
since
the
young
man
would
scarcely
be
such
a
peculiarly
qualified
kind
of
fool
as
to
return
and
partington
agreed
with
him
in
fact
this
had
been
her
one
comfort
all
day
for
it
seemed
to
her
with
her
frank
and
natural
ideas
that
on
the
whole
frank
and
gertie
had
done
the
proper
thing
she
was
pleased
too
to
think
that
she
had
been
right
in
her
surmises
as
to
attitude
to
frank
for
of
course
she
never
doubted
for
one
single
instant
that
the
two
had
eloped
together
in
the
ordinary
way
though
probably
without
any
intentions
of
matrimony
partington
presently
inquired
as
to
where
the
major
was
and
was
informed
that
he
was
of
course
at
the
queen
arms
he
had
been
there
in
fact
continuously
except
for
sudden
excursions
home
to
demand
whether
anything
had
been
heard
of
the
fugitives
since
about
eleven
that
morning
it
was
a
situation
that
needed
comfort
partington
added
a
few
comments
on
the
whole
situation
and
presently
put
on
her
bonnet
and
went
out
to
supplement
her
christmas
preparations
with
the
extra
five
shillings
leaving
her
husband
to
doze
in
the
windsor
chair
with
his
pipe
depending
from
his
mouth
he
had
walked
up
from
kent
that
morning
he
said
she
returned
in
time
to
get
tea
ready
bringing
with
her
various
relishes
and
found
that
the
situation
had
developed
slightly
since
her
departure
the
major
had
made
another
of
his
infuriated
returns
and
had
expanded
at
length
to
his
old
friend
partington
recounting
the
extraordinary
kindness
he
had
always
shown
to
frank
and
the
confidence
he
had
reposed
in
him
he
had
picked
him
up
it
seemed
when
the
young
man
had
been
practically
starving
and
had
been
father
and
comrade
to
him
ever
since
and
to
be
repaid
in
this
way
he
had
succeeded
also
by
his
eloquence
partington
perceived
in
winning
her
sympathies
and
was
now
gone
off
again
ostensibly
to
scour
the
neighborhood
once
more
but
more
probably
to
attempt
to
drown
his
grieved
and
wounded
feelings
partington
set
her
thin
lips
and
said
nothing
she
noticed
also
as
she
spread
the
table
a
number
of
bottles
set
upon
the
floor
two
of
them
with
yellow
labels
the
result
of
maggie
errand
and
prepared
herself
to
face
a
somewhat
riotous
evening
but
christmas
she
reflected
for
her
consolation
comes
but
once
a
year
it
was
about
nine
that
the
two
men
and
the
one
woman
sat
down
to
supper
upstairs
the
children
had
been
put
to
bed
in
the
kitchen
as
usual
after
jimmie
had
informed
his
mother
that
the
clergyman
had
been
round
no
less
than
three
times
since
four
to
inquire
after
the
vanished
lodger
he
was
a
little
tearful
at
being
put
to
bed
at
such
an
unusually
early
hour
as
it
appeared
had
promised
him
no
less
than
sixpence
if
he
would
come
round
to
the
within
five
minutes
after
the
lodger
return
and
it
was
obviously
impossible
to
traverse
the
streets
in
a
single
flannel
shirt
his
mother
dismissed
it
all
as
nonsense
she
told
him
that
frankie
was
not
coming
back
at
all
that
he
was
a
good
young
man
and
had
run
away
without
paying
mother
her
rent
this
made
the
situation
worse
than
ever
as
jimmie
protested
violently
against
this
shattering
of
his
ideal
and
his
mother
had
to
assume
a
good
deal
of
sternness
to
cover
up
her
own
tenderness
of
feeling
but
she
too
though
she
considered
the
flight
of
the
two
perfectly
usual
was
conscious
of
a
very
slight
sense
of
disappointment
herself
that
it
should
have
been
this
particular
young
man
who
had
done
it
then
she
went
upstairs
again
to
supper
iii
the
famous
archway
that
gives
entrance
to
the
district
of
hackney
wick
seems
especially
on
a
rainy
night
directly
designed
by
the
great
eastern
railway
as
a
vantage
ground
for
observant
loafers
with
a
desire
to
know
every
soul
that
enters
or
leaves
hackney
wick
it
is
of
course
possible
to
enter
hackney
wick
by
other
ways
it
may
be
approached
by
the
marshes
and
there
is
i
think
another
way
round
about
half
a
mile
to
the
east
under
the
railway
but
those
ways
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
people
coming
from
london
proper
you
arrive
at
victoria
park
station
you
turn
immediately
to
the
right
and
follow
the
pavement
down
with
the
park
on
your
left
until
you
come
to
the
archway
where
the
road
unites
with
that
coming
from
homerton
one
is
absolutely
safe
therefore
assuming
that
one
has
not
to
deal
with
watchful
criminals
in
standing
under
the
arch
with
the
certitude
that
sooner
or
later
if
you
wait
long
enough
the
man
whom
you
expect
to
enter
hackney
wick
will
pass
within
ten
yards
of
you
of
course
knew
this
perfectly
well
and
had
finally
communicated
the
fact
to
the
other
two
quite
early
in
the
afternoon
an
elaborate
system
of
watches
therefore
had
been
arranged
by
which
one
of
the
three
had
been
on
guard
continuously
since
three
it
was
jack
who
had
had
the
privilege
if
he
had
but
known
it
of
observing
partington
himself
returning
home
to
his
family
for
christmas
and
it
was
dick
who
came
on
guard
about
five
who
had
seen
the
major
or
rather
what
was
to
him
merely
a
shabby
and
excited
man
leave
and
then
return
to
the
queen
arms
during
his
watch
after
the
amazing
and
shocking
news
however
of
the
accident
to
lord
talgarth
and
archie
the
precautions
had
been
doubled
it
was
the
clergyman
who
had
first
bought
an
evening
paper
soon
after
five
and
within
five
minutes
the
other
two
knew
it
also
it
is
of
no
good
to
try
to
describe
the
effect
it
had
on
their
minds
beyond
saying
that
it
made
all
three
of
them
absolutely
resolute
that
frank
should
by
no
possible
means
escape
them
the
full
dramatic
situation
of
it
all
they
scarcely
appreciated
though
it
soaked
more
and
more
into
them
gradually
as
they
waited
two
of
them
in
the
men
club
just
round
the
corner
and
the
third
shivering
and
stamping
under
the
arch
an
unemployed
man
known
to
the
clergyman
had
been
set
as
an
additional
sentry
on
the
steps
of
the
men
club
whose
duty
it
would
be
the
moment
the
signal
was
given
from
the
arch
that
frank
was
coming
to
call
the
other
two
instantly
from
inside
further
the
clergyman
as
has
been
related
had
been
round
three
times
since
four
to
turner
road
and
had
taken
jimmie
into
his
pay
the
situation
was
really
rather
startling
even
to
the
imperturbable
dick
this
pleasant
young
man
to
whom
he
had
begun
to
feel
very
strangely
tender
during
the
last
month
or
two
now
tramping
london
streets
or
driving
a
van
in
his
miserable
old
clothes
described
to
him
by
the
clergyman
or
working
at
the
jam
factory
was
actually
no
one
else
at
this
moment
but
the
new
lord
talgarth
with
all
that
that
implied
merefield
was
his
the
big
house
in
berkeley
square
was
his
the
moor
in
scotland
it
was
an
entire
reversal
of
the
whole
thing
it
was
as
a
change
of
trumps
in
whist
everything
had
altered
its
value
well
he
had
plenty
of
time
both
before
he
came
off
guard
at
seven
and
after
he
had
joined
the
clergyman
in
the
men
club
to
sort
out
the
facts
and
their
consequences
about
ten
the
three
held
a
consultation
under
the
archway
while
trains
rumbled
overhead
they
attracted
very
little
attention
here
the
archway
is
dark
and
wide
they
were
muffled
to
the
eyes
and
there
usually
is
a
fringe
of
people
standing
under
shelter
here
on
rainy
evenings
they
leaned
back
against
the
wall
and
talked
they
had
taken
further
steps
since
they
had
last
met
had
been
round
to
the
jam
factory
and
had
returned
with
the
news
that
the
van
had
come
back
under
the
charge
of
only
one
of
the
drivers
and
that
the
other
one
who
was
called
gregory
whom
was
inquiring
after
would
certainly
be
dismissed
in
consequence
he
had
taken
the
address
of
the
driver
who
was
now
off
duty
somewhere
in
homerton
with
the
intention
of
going
to
see
him
next
morning
if
frank
had
not
appeared
there
were
two
points
they
were
discussing
now
first
should
the
police
be
informed
secondly
was
it
probable
that
frank
would
have
heard
the
news
and
if
so
was
it
conceivable
that
he
had
gone
straight
off
somewhere
in
consequence
to
his
lawyers
or
even
to
merefield
itself
dick
remembered
the
name
of
the
firm
quite
well
at
least
he
thought
so
should
he
send
a
wire
to
inquire
but
then
in
that
case
jack
shrewdly
pointed
out
everything
was
as
it
should
be
and
this
reflection
caused
the
three
considerable
comfort
for
all
that
there
were
one
or
two
ifs
was
it
likely
that
frank
should
have
heard
the
news
he
was
notoriously
hard
up
and
the
name
talgarth
had
not
appeared
so
far
on
any
of
the
posters
yet
he
might
easily
have
been
given
a
paper
or
picked
one
up
and
then
so
the
discussion
went
on
and
there
was
not
much
to
be
got
out
of
it
the
final
decision
come
to
was
this
that
guard
should
be
kept
as
before
until
twelve
midnight
that
at
that
hour
the
three
should
leave
the
archway
and
in
company
visit
two
places
turner
road
and
the
and
that
the
occupants
of
both
these
places
should
be
informed
of
the
facts
and
that
then
all
three
should
go
to
bed
iv
at
ten
minutes
past
eleven
dick
moved
away
from
the
fire
in
the
club
where
he
had
just
been
warming
himself
after
his
vigil
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
he
had
no
idea
why
he
was
so
uncomfortable
and
he
determined
to
set
to
work
to
reassure
himself
the
clergyman
he
noticed
was
beginning
to
doze
a
little
by
the
fire
for
the
club
had
just
been
officially
closed
and
the
rooms
were
empty
of
course
it
was
not
pleasant
to
have
to
tell
a
young
man
that
his
father
and
brother
were
dead
dick
himself
was
conscious
of
a
considerable
shock
but
surely
the
situation
was
on
the
whole
enormously
improved
this
morning
frank
was
a
pauper
he
was
practically
a
millionaire
as
well
as
a
peer
of
the
realm
this
morning
his
friends
had
nothing
by
which
they
might
appeal
to
him
except
common
sense
and
affection
and
frank
had
very
little
of
the
one
and
it
would
seem
a
very
curious
idea
of
the
other
of
course
all
that
affair
about
jenny
was
a
bad
business
dick
could
hardly
even
now
trust
himself
to
think
of
her
too
much
and
not
to
discuss
her
at
all
but
frank
would
get
over
it
then
still
walking
up
and
down
and
honestly
reassured
by
sheer
reason
he
began
to
think
of
what
part
jenny
would
play
in
the
future
it
was
a
very
odd
situation
a
very
odd
situation
indeed
the
deliberate
and
dick
used
an
even
stronger
expression
here
was
a
young
woman
who
had
jilted
the
son
and
married
the
father
obviously
from
ambitious
motives
and
now
found
herself
almost
immediately
in
the
position
of
a
very
much
unestablished
kind
of
dowager
with
the
jilted
son
reigning
in
her
husband
stead
and
what
on
earth
would
happen
next
diamonds
had
been
trumps
now
it
looked
as
if
hearts
were
to
succeed
them
and
what
a
very
remarkable
pattern
was
that
of
these
hearts
but
to
come
back
to
frank
and
at
that
moment
he
heard
a
noise
at
the
door
and
as
the
clergyman
started
up
from
his
doze
dick
saw
the
towzled
and
becapped
head
of
the
unemployed
man
and
his
hand
beckoning
violently
and
heard
his
hoarse
voice
adjuring
them
to
make
haste
the
gentleman
under
the
arch
he
said
was
signaling
the
scene
was
complete
when
the
two
arrived
with
the
unemployed
man
encouraging
them
from
behind
half
a
minute
later
under
the
archway
jack
had
faced
frank
fairly
and
squarely
on
the
further
pavement
and
was
holding
him
in
talk
my
dear
chap
he
was
saying
we
been
waiting
for
you
all
day
thank
the
lord
you
come
frank
looked
a
piteous
sight
thought
dick
who
now
for
the
first
time
saw
the
costume
that
had
described
with
such
minuteness
he
was
standing
almost
under
the
lamp
and
there
were
heavy
drooping
shadows
on
his
face
he
looked
five
years
older
than
when
dick
had
last
seen
him
only
at
easter
but
his
voice
was
confident
and
enough
my
dear
jack
he
was
saying
you
really
must
interrupt
i
only
just
then
he
broke
off
as
he
recognized
the
others
so
you
given
me
away
after
all
he
said
with
a
certain
sternness
to
the
clergyman
indeed
i
have
cried
that
artless
young
man
they
came
quite
unexpectedly
this
morning
and
you
told
them
that
they
could
catch
me
here
said
frank
well
it
makes
no
difference
i
going
on
hullo
dick
look
here
said
dick
it
really
serious
you
heard
about
his
voice
broke
i
heard
about
it
said
frank
but
that
does
make
any
difference
for
but
my
dear
man
cried
jack
seizing
him
by
the
lapel
of
his
coat
it
simply
ridiculous
we
come
down
here
on
purpose
you
killing
yourself
one
moment
said
frank
tell
me
exactly
what
you
want
dick
pushed
to
the
front
let
him
alone
you
fellows
this
is
what
we
want
frank
we
want
you
to
come
straight
to
the
for
you
and
i
go
and
see
the
lawyers
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
go
up
to
merefield
by
the
afternoon
train
i
sorry
but
you
really
got
to
go
through
with
it
you
the
head
of
the
family
now
they
be
all
waiting
for
you
there
and
they
ca
do
anything
without
you
this
must
get
into
the
papers
fortunately
not
a
soul
knows
of
it
yet
though
they
would
have
if
you
been
half
an
hour
later
now
come
along
one
moment
said
frank
i
agree
with
nearly
all
that
you
said
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
he
paused
a
moment
that
the
head
of
the
family
should
be
at
merefield
night
but
for
you
three
must
just
go
round
to
the
and
wait
i
got
to
finish
my
job
clean
out
and
what
job
cried
two
voices
simultaneously
frank
leaned
against
the
wall
and
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
i
really
do
propose
to
go
into
all
that
now
it
take
an
hour
but
two
of
you
know
most
of
the
story
in
a
dozen
words
it
this
i
got
the
girl
away
and
now
i
going
to
tell
the
man
and
tell
him
a
few
other
things
at
the
same
time
that
the
whole
thing
now
clear
off
please
i
awfully
obliged
you
know
and
all
that
but
you
really
must
let
me
finish
it
before
i
do
anything
else
there
was
a
silence
it
seemed
tolerably
reasonable
put
like
that
at
least
it
seemed
consistent
with
what
appeared
to
the
three
to
be
the
amazing
unreason
of
all
frank
proceedings
they
hesitated
and
were
lost
will
you
swear
not
to
clear
out
of
hackney
wick
before
we
seen
you
again
demanded
jack
hoarsely
frank
bowed
his
head
yes
he
said
the
clergyman
and
dick
were
consulting
in
low
voices
jack
looked
at
them
with
a
wild
sort
of
appeal
in
his
face
he
was
completely
bewildered
and
hoped
for
help
but
none
came
will
you
swear
he
began
again
frank
put
his
hand
suddenly
on
his
friend
shoulder
look
here
old
man
i
really
rather
done
up
i
think
you
might
let
me
go
without
any
more
all
right
we
agree
said
dick
suddenly
and
very
good
said
frank
then
there
really
no
more
he
turned
as
if
to
go
frank
frank
cried
jack
frank
turned
and
glanced
at
him
and
then
went
on
he
cried
and
so
they
let
him
go
they
watched
him
in
silence
cross
the
road
by
the
queen
arms
and
pass
up
the
pavement
as
he
drew
near
each
lamp
his
shadow
lay
behind
him
shortened
vanished
and
reappeared
before
him
after
the
third
lamp
they
lost
him
and
they
knew
he
would
a
moment
later
pass
into
turner
road
so
they
let
him
go
v
room
looked
very
warm
and
after
the
comfortlessness
of
the
damp
streets
it
was
as
has
already
been
related
the
madonna
the
prints
the
low
the
drawn
curtains
the
rosy
walls
the
dancing
firelight
and
the
electric
lamp
it
was
even
reassuring
at
first
safe
and
protected
and
the
three
sat
down
content
a
tray
with
some
cold
meat
and
cheese
rested
on
the
table
by
the
fire
and
cocoa
in
a
brown
jug
stood
warming
in
the
fender
they
had
had
irregular
kinds
of
refreshments
in
the
men
club
at
odd
intervals
and
were
exceedingly
hungry
they
began
to
talk
presently
and
it
was
astonishing
how
the
sight
and
touch
of
frank
had
cheered
them
more
than
one
of
the
three
has
confessed
to
me
since
that
a
large
part
of
the
anxiety
was
caused
by
his
simple
absence
and
by
imaginative
little
pictures
of
street
accidents
it
would
have
been
so
extremely
ironical
if
he
had
happened
to
have
been
run
over
on
the
day
on
which
he
became
lord
talgarth
they
laid
their
little
plans
too
for
the
next
day
dick
had
thought
it
all
out
he
jack
and
frank
were
to
call
at
the
lawyers
office
in
lincoln
inn
fields
and
leave
a
message
as
the
office
would
be
closed
of
course
immediately
after
the
wanderer
had
been
dressed
properly
in
clothes
then
they
would
catch
the
early
afternoon
train
and
get
to
merefield
that
night
the
funeral
could
not
possibly
take
place
for
several
days
there
would
have
to
be
an
inquest
then
they
read
over
the
account
of
the
smash
in
the
newspaper
special
edition
it
seemed
to
have
been
nobody
fault
the
brake
had
refused
to
act
going
down
a
steep
hill
they
had
run
into
a
wall
the
chauffeur
had
been
thrown
clean
over
it
the
two
passengers
had
been
pinned
under
the
car
lord
talgarth
was
dead
at
once
archie
had
died
five
minutes
after
being
taken
out
so
they
all
talked
at
once
in
low
voices
but
in
the
obvious
excitement
of
relief
it
was
an
extraordinary
pleasure
to
them
now
that
they
looked
at
it
in
the
sanity
conferred
by
food
and
warmth
to
reflect
that
frank
was
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
them
certainly
in
dreary
surroundings
but
it
was
for
the
last
time
would
see
him
restored
to
ordinary
life
his
delusions
and
vagaries
plucked
from
him
by
irresistible
circumstance
and
the
future
in
his
hands
midnight
still
found
them
talking
alert
and
cheerful
but
a
little
silence
fell
as
they
heard
the
chiming
of
bells
christmas
day
by
george
said
the
clergyman
merry
christmas
they
shook
hands
smiling
shamefacedly
as
is
the
custom
of
englishmen
and
to
think
of
old
frank
mused
jack
half
aloud
i
told
you
guiseley
about
his
coming
to
me
in
the
autumn
he
had
been
thinking
a
great
deal
about
that
visit
lately
and
about
what
frank
had
told
him
of
himself
the
idea
he
had
of
something
going
on
behind
the
scenes
in
which
he
had
passively
to
take
his
part
his
remark
on
how
pleasant
it
must
be
to
be
a
squire
well
the
play
had
come
to
an
end
it
seemed
now
there
followed
the
life
of
a
squire
indeed
it
was
curious
to
think
that
frank
was
actually
at
this
moment
lord
talgarth
dick
nodded
his
head
smiling
to
himself
in
his
beard
somehow
or
another
the
turn
things
had
taken
had
submerged
in
him
for
the
present
the
consciousness
of
the
tragedy
up
at
merefield
and
his
own
private
griefs
and
the
memory
of
jenny
jack
told
it
all
again
briefly
he
piled
it
on
about
the
major
and
his
extreme
repulsiveness
and
the
draggled
appearance
of
gertie
and
frank
incredible
obstinacy
and
to
think
that
he
brought
it
off
and
got
the
girl
home
to
her
people
well
thank
the
lord
that
over
we
sha
have
any
more
of
that
sort
of
thing
dick
got
up
presently
and
began
to
walk
about
eyeing
the
pictures
and
the
books
want
to
turn
in
asked
the
cleric
well
i
think
as
we
an
early
start
the
clergyman
jumped
up
you
a
beastly
little
room
i
afraid
we
rather
full
up
and
you
mr
kirkby
i
wait
till
you
come
back
he
said
the
two
went
out
after
and
jack
was
left
staring
at
the
fire
he
felt
very
and
listened
contentedly
to
the
dying
noises
of
the
streets
somewhere
in
that
hive
outside
was
frank
old
frank
that
was
very
good
to
think
of
during
these
last
months
frank
personality
had
been
very
persistently
before
him
it
was
not
that
he
pretended
to
understand
him
in
the
very
least
but
he
understood
enough
now
to
feel
that
there
was
something
very
admirable
in
it
all
it
was
mad
and
quixotic
and
absurd
but
it
had
a
certain
light
of
nobility
of
course
it
would
never
do
if
people
in
general
behaved
like
that
society
simply
could
not
go
on
if
everyone
went
about
espousing
the
cause
of
unhappy
and
individuals
and
put
on
old
clothes
and
played
the
ass
but
for
all
that
it
was
not
unpleasant
to
reflect
that
his
own
friend
had
chosen
to
do
these
things
in
despite
of
convention
there
was
a
touch
of
fineness
in
it
and
it
was
all
over
now
thank
god
what
times
they
would
have
up
in
the
north
he
heard
a
gate
clash
somewhere
outside
the
sound
just
detached
itself
from
the
murmur
of
the
night
then
a
late
train
ran
grinding
over
the
embanked
railway
behind
the
house
and
drew
up
with
the
screaming
of
brakes
at
victoria
park
station
and
distracted
him
again
are
you
ready
mr
kirkby
said
the
clergyman
coming
in
jack
stood
up
stretching
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
stretch
he
stopped
what
that
noise
he
asked
they
stood
listening
then
again
came
the
sharp
prolonged
tingle
of
an
electric
bell
followed
by
a
battering
at
a
door
downstairs
jack
looking
in
the
other
face
saw
him
go
ever
so
slightly
pale
beneath
his
eyes
there
somebody
at
the
door
said
i
just
go
down
and
see
and
as
jack
stood
there
motionless
and
breathless
he
could
hear
no
sound
but
the
thick
hammering
of
his
own
heart
at
the
base
of
his
throat
chapter
viii
i
at
eleven
partington
came
upstairs
to
the
room
where
the
two
men
were
still
drinking
to
make
one
more
suggestion
that
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
it
was
a
dreary
little
room
this
front
bedroom
on
the
first
floor
where
frank
and
the
major
had
slept
last
night
in
one
large
double
bed
the
bed
was
pushed
now
close
against
the
wall
the
clothes
still
tumbled
and
unmade
with
various
articles
lying
upon
it
as
on
a
table
a
chair
without
a
back
stood
between
it
and
the
window
the
table
where
the
two
men
still
sat
was
pulled
close
to
the
fire
that
had
been
lighted
partly
in
honor
of
partington
and
partly
in
honor
of
christmas
and
was
covered
with
a
of
plates
and
glasses
and
tobacco
and
bottles
there
was
a
filled
with
holly
obtained
from
the
butcher
shop
in
the
middle
of
the
table
there
was
very
little
furniture
in
the
room
there
was
a
chest
of
drawers
opposite
the
door
and
this
too
held
a
little
regiment
of
bottles
there
was
a
large
oleograph
of
queen
victoria
hanging
above
the
bed
and
a
text
for
some
inscrutable
reason
was
permitted
to
hang
above
the
fireplace
proclaiming
that
the
lord
is
merciful
and
in
gothic
letters
peeping
modestly
out
of
a
wealth
of
painted
with
a
in
the
middle
distance
and
a
stile
on
the
further
side
of
the
fireplace
was
a
with
a
tin
pail
below
it
and
the
major
bowler
hat
reposing
in
the
basin
there
was
a
piece
of
carpet
underneath
the
table
and
a
woolly
sort
of
mat
trodden
through
in
two
or
three
places
beside
the
bed
partington
coughed
as
she
came
in
so
tremendous
was
the
reek
of
tobacco
smoke
burning
paraffin
and
spirits
bless
the
men
she
said
and
choked
once
more
she
was
feeling
comparatively
it
was
a
considerable
relief
to
her
that
frank
actually
had
not
come
back
though
she
never
had
for
one
instant
expected
him
to
do
so
but
she
did
want
any
more
disturbances
or
quarrels
and
as
she
looked
at
the
major
who
turned
in
his
chair
as
she
came
in
she
felt
even
more
relieved
his
appearance
was
not
reassuring
he
had
been
drinking
pretty
steadily
all
day
to
drown
his
grief
and
had
ended
up
by
a
very
supper
with
his
landlord
there
were
four
empty
beer
bottles
and
one
empty
whisky
bottle
distributed
on
the
table
or
floor
and
another
whisky
bottle
stood
between
the
two
men
on
the
table
and
as
she
looked
at
the
major
she
was
completely
experienced
in
alcoholic
symptoms
she
understood
exactly
what
stage
he
had
reached
now
the
major
was
by
no
means
a
drunkard
let
that
be
understood
he
drank
whenever
he
could
but
a
tramp
can
not
drink
to
very
grave
excess
he
is
perpetually
walking
and
he
is
perpetually
poor
but
this
was
a
special
occasion
it
was
christmas
he
was
home
in
london
his
landlord
had
returned
and
he
had
lost
gertie
he
had
reached
then
the
dangerous
stage
when
the
alcohol
after
having
excited
and
warmed
and
confused
the
brain
recoils
from
it
to
some
extent
leaving
it
clear
and
resolute
and
entirely
reckless
and
entirely
conscious
of
any
idea
that
happens
to
be
dominant
at
least
that
is
the
effect
on
some
temperaments
the
maudlin
stage
had
passed
long
ago
at
the
beginning
of
supper
when
the
major
had
leaned
his
head
on
his
plate
and
wept
over
the
ingratitude
of
man
and
the
peculiar
poignancy
of
old
frankie
individual
exhibition
of
it
a
noisy
stage
had
succeeded
to
this
and
now
there
was
deadly
quiet
he
was
rather
white
in
the
face
his
eyes
were
set
but
very
bright
and
he
was
smoking
hard
and
fast
now
then
said
partington
cheerfully
time
for
bed
her
husband
winked
at
her
gravely
which
was
his
nearest
approach
to
hilarity
he
was
a
quiet
man
at
all
times
the
major
said
nothing
there
there
awake
again
said
the
mother
as
a
wail
rose
up
the
staircase
i
be
up
again
presently
and
she
vanished
once
more
two
of
the
children
were
awake
after
all
jimmie
lay
and
alert
beside
his
brother
and
looked
at
his
mother
reflectively
as
she
came
in
he
was
still
thinking
about
the
sixpence
that
might
conceivably
have
been
his
lamentation
stopped
as
she
came
in
and
she
went
to
the
table
first
to
turn
down
the
smoking
lamp
she
was
quite
a
kindly
mother
a
great
deal
more
tender
than
she
seemed
and
knew
it
well
enough
but
he
respected
her
sufficiently
to
stop
crying
when
she
came
in
now
then
she
said
with
motherly
sternness
i
ca
then
she
stopped
abruptly
she
had
heard
steps
on
the
pavement
outside
as
she
came
into
the
room
and
now
she
heard
the
handle
of
the
street
door
turned
and
someone
come
into
the
passage
she
stood
wondering
and
in
that
pause
she
missed
her
chance
for
the
steps
came
straight
past
the
door
and
began
to
go
upstairs
it
might
of
course
conceivably
be
one
of
the
lodgers
on
the
and
yet
she
knew
it
was
not
she
whisked
to
the
door
a
moment
later
but
it
was
too
late
and
she
was
only
just
in
time
to
see
the
figure
she
knew
turn
the
corner
of
the
four
stairs
that
led
to
the
landing
is
that
frankie
asked
jimmie
suddenly
sitting
up
in
bed
oh
mother
let
me
you
be
quiet
snapped
the
woman
and
stood
listening
with
parted
lips
ii
from
that
point
partington
seems
to
have
been
able
to
follow
very
closely
what
must
have
taken
place
upstairs
it
was
a
very
quiet
night
here
in
turner
road
the
roysterers
were
in
the
streets
and
the
sober
folk
were
at
home
and
there
was
not
a
footstep
on
the
pavements
outside
to
confuse
the
little
drama
of
sound
that
came
down
to
her
through
the
boards
overhead
she
could
not
explain
afterwards
why
she
did
not
interfere
i
imagine
that
she
hoped
against
hope
that
she
was
misinterpreting
what
she
heard
and
also
that
a
kind
of
terror
seized
her
which
she
found
it
really
impossible
to
shake
off
first
there
was
the
opening
and
closing
of
the
door
two
or
three
footsteps
and
then
dead
silence
then
she
heard
talking
begin
first
one
voice
then
a
crescendo
as
if
two
or
three
clamored
together
then
one
voice
again
it
was
impossible
so
far
to
distinguish
which
was
which
this
went
on
for
a
minute
or
two
occasionally
there
was
a
crescendo
and
once
or
twice
some
voice
rose
almost
into
a
shout
then
without
warning
there
was
a
shuffling
of
feet
and
a
crash
as
of
an
overturned
chair
and
instant
upon
the
noise
set
up
a
prolonged
wail
you
be
quiet
snapped
the
woman
in
a
sharp
whisper
the
noises
went
on
now
the
stamp
of
a
foot
now
the
scraping
of
something
overhead
and
a
voice
or
two
in
sharp
deep
exclamation
and
then
complete
silence
once
more
was
sobbing
now
as
noiselessly
as
he
could
terrified
at
his
mother
face
and
jimmie
was
up
standing
on
the
floor
in
his
flannel
shirt
listening
like
his
mother
maggie
still
slept
deeply
on
the
further
side
of
the
bed
the
woman
went
on
a
step
nearer
the
door
opened
it
and
peeped
out
irresolutely
but
the
uncarpeted
stairs
stretched
up
into
the
darkness
unlit
except
for
the
glimmer
that
came
from
the
room
at
whose
door
she
was
standing
there
was
a
voice
now
rising
and
falling
steadily
and
she
heard
it
broken
in
upon
now
and
again
by
something
that
resembled
a
chuckle
somehow
or
another
this
sickened
her
more
than
all
else
it
was
like
her
husband
voice
she
recoiled
into
the
room
and
as
she
did
so
there
came
the
sound
of
blows
and
the
stamping
of
feet
and
she
knew
in
a
way
that
she
could
not
explain
that
there
was
no
fight
going
on
it
was
some
kind
of
punishment
not
a
conflict
she
would
have
given
the
world
to
move
to
run
to
the
street
door
and
scream
for
help
but
her
knees
shook
under
her
and
her
heart
seemed
to
be
hammering
itself
to
bits
jimmie
had
hold
of
her
now
clinging
round
her
shaking
with
terror
and
murmuring
something
she
could
not
understand
her
whole
attention
was
upstairs
she
was
wondering
how
long
it
would
go
on
it
must
be
past
midnight
now
she
thought
the
streets
seethed
still
as
death
but
overhead
there
was
still
movement
and
the
sound
of
blows
and
then
abruptly
the
end
came
there
was
one
more
crescendo
of
noise
two
voices
raised
in
dispute
one
almost
shrill
in
anger
or
expostulation
then
one
more
sudden
and
heavy
noise
as
of
a
blow
or
a
fall
and
dead
silence
iii
the
next
thing
that
partington
remembered
afterwards
was
that
she
found
herself
standing
on
the
landing
upstairs
listening
yet
afraid
to
move
all
was
very
nearly
silent
within
there
was
just
low
talking
and
the
sound
of
something
being
moved
it
was
her
husband
voice
that
she
heard
beyond
her
the
stairs
ran
up
to
the
next
story
and
she
became
aware
presently
that
someone
else
was
watching
too
an
untidy
head
of
a
woman
leaned
over
the
banisters
and
from
somewhere
beyond
lit
up
her
face
she
was
grinning
then
the
sharp
whisper
came
down
the
stairs
demanding
what
was
up
partington
jerked
her
thumb
towards
the
closed
door
and
nodded
reassuringly
she
was
aware
that
she
must
be
natural
at
all
costs
the
woman
still
hung
over
the
banisters
a
minute
longer
and
then
was
gone
jimmie
was
with
her
too
now
still
just
in
his
shirt
perfectly
quiet
with
a
face
as
white
as
paper
his
big
black
eyes
dwelt
on
his
face
then
suddenly
she
could
bear
the
suspense
no
more
she
stole
up
to
the
door
still
on
still
listening
and
laid
her
fingers
on
the
handle
there
were
more
gentle
movements
within
now
the
noise
of
water
and
a
basin
she
heard
the
china
clink
distinctly
but
no
more
words
she
turned
the
handle
resolutely
and
looked
in
the
major
was
leaning
in
the
corner
by
the
window
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
staring
with
a
dull
white
defiant
kind
of
face
at
the
bed
the
lamp
on
the
mantelpiece
lighted
him
up
clearly
on
his
knees
by
the
bedside
was
her
husband
with
his
back
to
her
supporting
a
basin
on
the
bed
and
some
thing
dark
that
hung
over
it
then
she
saw
frank
it
was
he
who
was
lying
on
the
bed
almost
upon
his
face
one
boot
dangled
down
on
this
side
and
it
was
his
head
that
her
husband
was
supporting
she
stared
at
it
a
moment
in
terror
then
her
eyes
wandered
to
the
floor
where
among
the
pieces
of
broken
glass
a
pool
of
dark
liquid
spread
slowly
over
the
boards
twigs
and
detached
leaves
of
holly
lay
in
the
midst
of
it
and
at
that
sight
her
instinct
reasserted
herself
she
stepped
forward
and
took
her
husband
by
the
shoulder
he
turned
a
face
that
twitched
a
little
towards
her
she
pushed
him
aside
took
the
basin
from
him
and
the
young
man
head
clear
out
of
this
she
whispered
sharply
quick
mind
you
and
the
major
jimmie
the
boy
was
by
her
in
an
instant
shaking
all
over
but
perfectly
jimmie
put
your
things
on
and
be
off
to
the
ring
up
and
ask
for
carter
bring
him
round
with
you
frank
head
slipped
a
little
in
her
hands
and
she
half
rose
to
steady
it
when
she
had
finished
and
looked
round
again
for
her
husband
the
room
was
empty
from
below
up
the
stairs
came
a
sudden
draught
and
the
flame
leaped
in
the
and
then
once
more
unrestrained
rose
up
the
wailing
of
iv
a
little
after
dawn
on
that
christmas
morning
sat
solitary
in
the
kitchen
the
children
had
been
packed
off
to
a
neighbor
house
before
and
he
himself
had
been
to
and
fro
all
night
and
was
tired
out
to
the
priest
house
at
homerton
to
the
doctor
and
to
the
parish
nurse
all
the
proper
things
had
been
done
frank
had
been
anointed
by
the
priest
bandaged
by
the
doctor
and
settled
in
by
the
nurse
into
the
middle
of
the
big
double
bed
he
had
not
yet
recovered
consciousness
they
were
upstairs
now
jack
dick
and
the
nurse
the
priest
and
the
doctor
had
promised
to
look
in
before
nine
there
was
nothing
more
that
they
could
do
for
the
present
they
said
and
partington
was
out
at
this
moment
to
fetch
something
from
the
dispensary
he
had
heard
her
story
during
one
of
the
intervals
in
the
course
of
the
night
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
a
tolerably
accurate
theory
of
the
whole
affair
if
that
is
to
say
her
interpretation
of
the
noises
she
had
heard
was
at
all
correct
the
major
must
have
made
an
unexpected
attack
probably
by
a
kick
that
had
temporarily
disabled
frank
and
must
then
with
judicial
though
amused
approval
have
proceeded
to
inflict
chastisement
upon
frank
as
he
lay
on
the
floor
this
must
have
gone
on
for
a
considerable
time
frank
seemed
to
have
been
heavily
kicked
all
over
his
body
and
the
thing
must
have
ended
with
a
sudden
uncontrolled
attack
on
the
part
of
the
major
not
only
with
his
boots
but
with
at
least
one
of
the
heavy
bottles
the
young
man
head
was
cut
deeply
as
if
by
glass
and
it
was
probably
three
or
four
kicks
on
the
head
before
partington
could
interfere
that
had
concluded
the
punishment
the
doctor
evidence
entirely
corroborated
this
interpretation
of
events
it
was
of
course
impossible
to
know
whether
frank
had
had
the
time
or
the
will
to
make
any
resistance
the
police
had
been
communicated
with
but
there
was
no
news
yet
of
the
two
men
involved
it
was
one
of
those
bleak
uncomfortable
dawns
that
have
no
beauty
either
of
warmth
or
serenity
at
least
it
seemed
so
here
in
turner
road
above
the
torn
and
dingy
strip
of
lace
that
shrouded
the
lower
part
of
the
window
towered
the
black
fronts
of
the
high
houses
against
the
steely
western
sky
it
was
extraordinarily
quiet
now
and
then
a
footstep
echoed
and
died
suddenly
as
some
crossed
the
end
of
the
street
but
there
was
no
murmur
of
voices
yet
or
groups
at
the
doors
as
no
doubt
there
would
be
when
the
news
became
known
the
room
too
was
cheerless
the
fire
was
long
ago
gone
out
the
children
bed
was
still
tumbled
and
disordered
and
the
paraffin
lamp
had
smoked
itself
out
half
an
hour
ago
overhead
the
clergyman
could
hear
now
and
again
a
very
gentle
footstep
and
that
was
all
he
was
worn
out
with
excitement
and
a
kind
of
terror
and
events
took
for
him
the
same
kind
of
clear
hard
outline
as
did
the
physical
objects
themselves
in
this
cold
light
of
dawn
he
had
passed
through
a
dozen
moods
furious
anger
at
the
senseless
crime
at
the
hopeless
miserable
waste
of
a
life
an
overwhelming
compassion
and
a
wholly
unreasonable
for
not
having
foreseen
danger
more
clearly
the
night
before
there
were
other
thoughts
that
had
come
to
him
too
doubts
as
to
whether
the
internal
significance
of
all
these
things
were
in
the
least
analogous
to
the
external
happenings
whether
perhaps
after
all
the
whole
affair
were
not
on
the
inner
side
a
complete
and
perfect
event
in
fact
a
startling
success
of
a
nature
which
he
could
not
understand
certainly
exteriorly
a
more
lamentable
failure
and
waste
could
not
be
conceived
there
had
been
sacrificed
such
an
array
of
advantages
birth
money
education
gifts
position
and
for
such
an
exceedingly
small
and
doubtful
good
that
no
additional
data
it
would
appear
could
possibly
explain
the
situation
yet
was
it
possible
that
such
data
did
exist
somewhere
and
that
another
golden
and
perfect
deed
had
been
done
that
there
was
no
waste
no
failure
after
all
but
at
present
these
thoughts
only
came
to
him
in
glimpses
he
was
exhausted
now
of
emotion
and
speculation
he
regarded
the
pitiless
facts
with
a
sunken
unenergetic
attention
and
wondered
when
he
would
be
called
again
upstairs
there
came
a
footstep
outside
it
hesitated
then
the
street
door
was
pushed
open
and
the
step
came
in
up
to
the
room
door
and
a
small
face
pinched
with
cold
its
eyes
all
burning
looked
at
him
come
in
jimmie
he
whispered
and
so
the
two
sat
huddled
one
against
the
other
and
the
man
felt
again
and
again
a
shudder
though
not
of
cold
shake
the
little
body
at
his
side
v
ten
minutes
later
a
step
came
down
the
stairs
a
little
hurriedly
though
on
and
partington
her
own
thin
face
lined
with
sleeplessness
and
emotion
and
her
lips
set
nodded
at
him
emphatically
he
understood
and
went
quickly
past
her
followed
closely
by
the
child
and
up
the
narrow
stairs
he
heard
the
close
behind
him
as
the
woman
left
the
house
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
came
into
the
room
as
if
he
had
stepped
clean
out
of
one
world
into
another
and
the
sense
of
it
was
so
sudden
and
abrupt
that
he
stood
for
an
instant
on
the
threshold
amazed
at
the
transition
first
it
was
the
absolute
stillness
and
motionlessness
of
the
room
that
impressed
him
so
far
as
any
one
element
predominated
there
were
persons
in
the
room
but
they
were
as
statues
on
the
farther
side
of
the
bed
decent
now
and
arranged
and
standing
out
across
the
room
kneeled
the
two
men
jack
kirkby
and
dick
guiseley
but
they
neither
lifted
their
eyes
nor
showed
the
faintest
consciousness
of
his
presence
as
he
entered
their
faces
were
in
shadow
behind
them
was
the
cold
patch
of
the
window
and
a
candle
within
half
an
inch
of
extinction
stood
also
behind
them
on
a
table
in
the
corner
with
one
or
two
covered
vessels
and
instruments
the
nurse
kneeled
on
this
side
one
arm
beneath
the
pillow
and
the
other
on
the
counterpane
and
then
there
was
frank
he
lay
perfectly
still
upon
his
back
his
hands
clasped
before
him
and
even
these
were
bandaged
his
head
lay
high
on
three
or
four
pillows
and
he
wore
what
looked
like
a
sort
of
cap
wholly
hiding
his
hair
and
ears
his
profile
alone
showed
and
distinct
against
the
gloom
in
the
corner
behind
his
face
was
entirely
tranquil
as
pale
as
ivory
his
lips
were
closed
his
eyes
alone
were
alive
presently
those
turned
a
little
and
the
man
standing
at
the
door
understanding
the
look
came
forward
and
kneeled
too
by
the
bed
then
little
by
little
he
began
in
that
living
stillness
to
understand
rather
better
what
it
was
that
he
was
witnessing
it
was
not
that
there
was
anything
physical
in
the
room
beyond
the
things
of
which
his
senses
told
him
there
was
but
the
dingy
furniture
the
white
bed
august
now
with
a
strange
dignity
as
of
a
white
altar
and
the
four
persons
beside
himself
five
now
for
jimmie
was
beside
him
but
that
the
physical
was
not
the
plane
in
which
these
five
persons
were
now
chiefly
conscious
was
the
most
evident
thing
of
all
there
was
about
them
not
a
presence
not
an
air
not
a
sweetness
or
a
sound
and
yet
it
is
by
such
negatives
only
that
the
thing
can
be
expressed
and
so
they
kneeled
and
waited
why
jack
it
shook
the
waiting
air
like
the
sound
of
a
bell
yet
it
was
only
whispered
the
man
nearest
him
on
the
other
side
shook
with
a
single
spasmodic
movement
and
laid
his
fingers
gently
on
the
bandaged
hands
and
then
for
a
long
while
there
was
no
further
movement
or
sound
rosary
said
frank
suddenly
still
in
a
whisper
beads
jack
moved
swiftly
on
his
knees
took
from
the
table
a
string
of
beads
from
where
they
had
been
laid
the
night
before
and
put
them
into
the
still
fingers
then
he
laid
his
own
hands
over
them
again
again
there
was
a
long
pause
outside
in
the
street
a
footstep
came
up
from
the
direction
of
mortimer
road
waxed
loud
and
clear
on
the
pavement
and
died
again
down
towards
the
street
leading
to
the
marshes
and
but
for
this
there
was
no
further
sound
for
a
while
then
a
cock
crew
thin
and
shrill
somewhere
far
away
a
dray
rumbled
past
the
end
of
the
street
and
was
silent
but
the
silence
in
the
room
was
of
a
different
quality
or
rather
the
world
seemed
silent
because
this
room
was
so
and
not
the
other
way
it
was
here
that
the
center
lay
where
a
battered
man
was
dying
and
from
this
center
radiated
out
the
great
peace
it
was
no
waste
then
after
all
this
life
of
strange
unreason
ending
in
this
very
climax
of
uselessness
exactly
when
ordinary
usefulness
was
about
to
begin
could
that
be
waste
that
ended
so
priest
whispered
the
voice
from
the
bed
then
dick
leaned
forward
he
has
been
he
said
distinctly
and
slowly
he
was
here
at
two
he
did
what
he
came
for
and
he
coming
again
directly
the
eyes
closed
in
sign
of
assent
and
opened
again
he
seemed
to
be
looking
as
in
a
kind
of
meditation
at
nothing
in
particular
it
was
as
a
man
who
waits
at
his
ease
for
some
pleasant
little
event
that
will
unroll
by
and
by
he
was
in
no
ecstasy
and
it
seemed
in
no
pain
and
in
no
fierce
expectation
he
was
simply
at
his
ease
and
waiting
he
was
content
whatever
those
others
might
be
for
a
moment
it
crossed
the
young
clergyman
mind
that
he
ought
to
pray
aloud
but
the
thing
was
dismissed
instantly
it
seemed
to
him
impertinent
nonsense
that
was
not
what
was
required
it
was
his
business
to
watch
not
to
act
so
little
by
little
he
ceased
to
think
actively
he
ceased
to
consider
this
and
that
at
first
he
had
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
the
doctor
and
the
priest
arrived
the
woman
had
gone
to
fetch
them
he
had
wished
that
they
would
make
haste
he
had
wondered
what
the
others
felt
and
how
he
would
describe
it
all
to
his
vicar
now
little
by
little
all
this
ceased
and
the
peace
grew
within
and
without
till
the
balance
of
pressure
was
equalized
and
his
attention
floated
at
the
perfect
poise
again
there
was
no
symbol
or
analogy
that
presented
itself
it
was
not
even
by
negation
that
he
thought
there
was
just
one
positive
element
that
included
all
time
seemed
to
mean
nothing
the
ticks
of
the
clock
with
the
painted
face
were
scarcely
consecutive
it
was
all
one
and
distance
was
nothing
nor
nearness
not
even
the
nearness
of
the
dying
face
against
the
pillows
it
was
so
then
that
something
of
that
state
to
which
frank
had
passed
communicated
itself
to
at
least
one
of
those
who
saw
him
die
a
little
past
the
half
hour
frank
spoke
again
my
love
to
whitty
he
said
diary
tell
him
the
end
came
a
few
minutes
before
nine
and
it
seems
to
have
come
as
naturally
as
life
itself
there
was
no
drama
no
dying
speech
not
one
word
those
who
were
there
saw
him
move
ever
so
slightly
in
bed
and
his
head
lifted
a
little
then
his
head
sank
once
more
and
the
failure
was
complete
the
end
