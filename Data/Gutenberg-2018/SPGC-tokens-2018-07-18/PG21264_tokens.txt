chapter
i
introducing
terry
patten
it
was
through
the
forgery
case
that
i
first
made
the
acquaintance
of
terry
patten
and
at
the
time
i
should
have
been
more
than
willing
to
forego
the
pleasure
our
firm
rarely
dealt
with
criminal
cases
but
the
patterson
family
were
long
standing
clients
and
they
naturally
turned
to
us
when
the
trouble
came
ordinarily
so
important
a
matter
would
have
been
put
in
the
hands
of
one
of
the
older
men
but
it
happened
that
i
was
the
one
who
had
drawn
up
the
will
for
patterson
senior
the
night
before
his
suicide
therefore
the
brunt
of
the
work
devolved
upon
me
the
most
unpleasant
part
of
the
whole
affair
was
the
notoriety
could
we
have
kept
it
from
the
papers
it
would
not
have
been
so
bad
but
that
was
a
physical
impossibility
terry
patten
was
on
our
track
and
within
a
week
he
had
brought
down
upon
us
every
newspaper
in
new
york
the
first
i
ever
heard
of
terry
a
card
was
sent
in
bearing
the
inscription
terence
patten
and
in
the
lower
corner
of
the
i
shuddered
as
i
read
it
the
was
at
that
time
the
yellowest
of
the
yellow
journals
while
i
was
still
shuddering
terry
walked
in
through
the
door
the
office
boy
had
inadvertently
left
open
he
nodded
a
friendly
good
morning
helped
himself
to
a
chair
tossed
his
hat
and
gloves
upon
the
table
crossed
his
legs
comfortably
and
looked
me
over
i
returned
the
scrutiny
with
interest
while
i
was
mentally
framing
a
polite
formula
for
getting
rid
of
him
without
giving
rise
to
any
ill
feeling
i
had
no
desire
to
annoy
unnecessarily
any
of
the
young
men
at
first
sight
my
caller
did
not
strike
me
as
unlike
a
dozen
other
reporters
his
face
was
the
face
one
feels
he
has
a
right
to
expect
of
a
newspaper
man
keen
alert
humorous
on
the
for
opportunities
but
with
a
second
glance
i
commenced
to
feel
interested
i
wondered
where
he
had
come
from
and
what
he
had
done
in
the
past
his
features
were
undeniably
irish
but
that
which
chiefly
awakened
my
curiosity
was
his
expression
it
was
not
only
and
intelligent
it
was
something
more
knowing
one
would
say
it
carried
with
it
the
mark
of
experience
the
indelible
stamp
of
the
street
he
was
a
man
who
has
had
no
childhood
whose
education
commenced
from
the
cradle
i
did
not
arrive
at
all
of
these
conclusions
at
once
however
for
he
had
finished
his
inspection
before
i
had
fairly
started
mine
apparently
he
found
me
satisfactory
the
smile
which
had
been
lurking
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
broadened
to
a
grin
and
i
commenced
wondering
uncomfortably
what
there
was
funny
about
my
appearance
then
suddenly
he
leaned
forward
and
began
talking
in
a
quick
eager
way
that
required
all
my
attention
to
keep
abreast
of
him
after
a
short
preamble
in
which
he
set
forth
his
view
of
the
case
and
a
clearsighted
view
it
was
he
commenced
asking
questions
they
were
such
amazingly
impudent
questions
that
they
nearly
took
my
breath
away
but
he
asked
them
in
a
manner
so
engagingly
innocent
that
i
found
myself
answering
them
before
i
was
aware
of
it
there
was
a
confiding
air
of
about
the
fellow
which
completely
put
one
off
one
guard
at
the
end
of
fifteen
minutes
he
was
on
the
inside
track
of
most
of
my
affairs
and
was
giving
me
advice
through
a
kindly
desire
to
keep
me
from
getting
things
in
a
mess
the
situation
would
have
struck
me
as
ludicrous
had
i
stopped
to
think
of
it
but
it
is
a
fact
i
have
noted
since
that
with
terry
one
does
not
appreciate
situations
until
it
is
too
late
when
he
had
got
from
me
as
much
information
as
i
possessed
he
shook
hands
cordially
said
he
was
happy
to
have
made
my
acquaintance
and
would
try
to
drop
in
again
some
day
after
he
had
gone
and
i
had
had
time
to
review
our
conversation
i
began
to
grow
hot
over
the
matter
i
grew
hotter
still
when
i
read
his
report
in
the
paper
the
next
morning
i
could
not
understand
why
i
had
not
kicked
him
out
at
first
sight
and
i
sincerely
hoped
that
he
would
drop
in
again
that
i
might
avail
myself
of
the
opportunity
he
did
drop
in
and
i
received
him
with
the
utmost
cordiality
there
was
something
entirely
disarming
about
terry
impudence
and
so
it
went
he
continued
to
comment
upon
the
case
in
the
most
sensational
manner
possible
and
i
railed
against
him
and
forgave
him
with
unvarying
regularity
in
the
end
we
came
to
be
quite
friendly
over
the
affair
i
found
him
diverting
at
a
time
when
i
was
in
need
of
diversion
though
just
what
attraction
he
found
in
me
i
have
never
been
able
to
fathom
it
was
certainly
not
that
he
saw
a
future
source
of
stories
for
he
frankly
regarded
corporation
law
as
a
pursuit
devoid
of
interest
criminal
law
was
the
one
branch
of
the
profession
for
which
he
felt
any
respect
we
frequently
had
lunch
together
or
breakfast
in
his
case
his
day
commenced
about
noon
and
lasted
till
three
in
the
morning
well
terry
what
the
news
at
the
morgue
today
i
would
inquire
as
we
settled
ourselves
at
the
table
and
terry
would
rattle
off
the
details
of
the
latest
murder
mystery
with
a
cheerfully
air
that
would
have
been
disgusting
had
it
not
been
so
funny
it
was
at
this
time
that
i
learned
his
history
prior
to
the
days
of
the
he
was
entirely
frank
about
himself
and
if
one
half
of
his
stories
were
true
he
has
achieved
some
amazing
adventures
i
strongly
suspected
at
times
that
the
reporting
instinct
got
ahead
of
the
facts
and
that
he
embroidered
incidents
as
he
went
along
his
father
terry
senior
had
been
an
irish
politician
of
considerable
ability
and
some
prominence
on
the
east
river
side
of
the
city
the
boy
early
education
had
been
picked
up
in
the
streets
his
father
had
got
the
truant
officer
his
position
and
it
was
thorough
later
he
had
received
a
more
theoretical
training
in
the
university
of
new
york
but
i
think
it
was
his
early
education
which
stuck
by
him
longest
and
which
in
the
end
was
probably
the
more
useful
of
the
two
armed
with
this
equipment
it
was
inevitable
that
he
should
develop
into
a
star
reporter
not
only
did
he
write
his
news
in
an
entertaining
form
but
he
first
made
the
news
he
wrote
about
when
any
sensational
crime
had
been
committed
which
puzzled
the
police
terry
had
an
annoying
way
of
solving
the
mystery
himself
and
publishing
the
full
particulars
in
the
with
the
glory
blatantly
attributed
to
our
reporter
the
paper
was
fully
aware
that
terence
patten
was
an
acquisition
to
its
staff
it
had
sent
him
on
various
commissions
to
various
entertaining
quarters
of
the
globe
and
in
the
course
of
his
duty
he
had
encountered
experiences
one
is
forced
to
admit
that
he
was
not
always
fastidious
as
to
the
r√¥le
he
played
he
had
cruised
about
the
mediterranean
as
assistant
cook
on
a
millionaire
yacht
and
had
listened
to
secrets
between
meals
he
had
wandered
about
the
country
with
a
monkey
and
a
in
search
of
a
peddler
he
suspected
of
a
crime
he
had
helped
along
a
revolution
in
south
america
and
had
gone
up
in
a
captive
war
balloon
which
had
broken
loose
and
floated
off
but
all
this
is
of
no
concern
at
present
i
am
merely
going
to
chronicle
his
achievement
in
one
instance
in
what
he
himself
has
always
referred
to
as
the
mystery
it
has
already
been
written
up
in
reporter
style
as
the
details
came
to
light
from
day
to
day
but
a
newspaper
story
is
as
dead
as
if
it
were
written
on
parchment
and
since
the
part
terry
played
was
rather
remarkable
and
many
of
the
details
were
at
the
time
suppressed
i
think
it
deserves
a
more
permanent
form
it
was
through
the
business
by
a
roundabout
way
that
i
got
mixed
up
in
the
affair
i
had
been
working
very
hard
over
the
forgery
case
i
spent
every
day
on
it
for
nine
weeks
and
nearly
every
night
i
got
into
the
way
of
lying
awake
puzzling
over
the
details
when
i
should
have
been
sleeping
and
that
is
the
sort
of
work
which
finishes
a
man
by
the
middle
of
april
when
the
strain
was
over
i
was
as
near
being
a
nervous
wreck
as
an
ordinarily
healthy
chap
can
get
at
this
stage
my
doctor
stepped
in
and
ordered
a
rest
in
some
quiet
place
out
of
reach
of
the
new
york
papers
he
suggested
a
fishing
expedition
to
cape
cod
i
apathetically
fell
in
with
the
idea
and
invited
terry
to
join
me
but
he
jeered
at
the
notion
of
finding
either
pleasure
or
profit
in
any
such
trip
it
was
too
far
from
the
center
of
crime
to
contain
any
interest
for
terry
heavens
man
i
as
lief
spend
a
vacation
in
the
middle
of
the
sahara
desert
oh
the
fishing
would
keep
things
going
i
said
fishing
we
die
of
ennui
before
we
had
a
bite
i
be
murdering
you
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
just
for
some
excitement
if
you
need
a
rest
and
you
are
rather
seedy
forget
all
about
this
patterson
business
and
plunge
into
something
new
the
best
rest
in
the
world
is
a
this
was
terry
all
over
he
himself
was
utterly
devoid
of
nerves
and
he
could
not
appreciate
the
part
they
played
in
a
man
of
normal
my
being
threatened
with
nervous
prostration
he
regarded
as
a
joke
his
pleasantries
rather
damped
my
interest
in
fishing
however
and
i
cast
about
for
something
else
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
i
thought
of
plantation
was
the
somewhat
fantastic
name
of
a
stock
farm
in
the
shenandoah
valley
belonging
to
a
whom
i
had
not
seen
since
i
was
a
boy
a
few
months
before
i
had
had
occasion
to
settle
a
little
legal
matter
for
colonel
gaylord
he
was
a
colonel
by
courtesy
so
far
as
i
could
discover
he
had
never
had
his
hands
on
a
gun
except
for
rabbit
shooting
and
in
the
exchange
of
amenities
which
followed
he
had
given
me
a
standing
invitation
to
make
the
plantation
my
home
whenever
i
should
have
occasion
to
come
south
as
i
had
no
prospect
of
leaving
new
york
i
thought
nothing
of
it
at
the
time
but
now
i
determined
to
take
the
old
gentleman
at
his
word
and
spend
my
enforced
vacation
in
getting
acquainted
with
my
virginia
relatives
this
plan
struck
terry
as
just
one
degree
funnier
than
the
fishing
expedition
the
doctor
however
received
the
idea
with
enthusiasm
a
farm
he
said
with
plenty
of
outdoor
life
and
no
excitement
was
just
the
thing
i
needed
but
could
he
have
foreseen
the
events
which
were
to
happen
there
i
doubt
if
he
would
have
recommended
the
place
for
a
nervous
man
chapter
ii
i
arrive
at
plantation
as
i
rolled
southward
in
the
train
jerked
would
be
a
fitter
word
the
roadbeds
of
western
virginia
are
anything
but
level
i
strove
to
recall
my
old
time
impressions
of
plantation
it
was
one
of
the
big
plantations
in
that
part
of
the
state
and
had
always
been
noted
for
its
hospitality
my
vague
recollection
of
the
place
was
a
kaleidoscopic
vision
of
music
and
dancing
and
laughter
set
in
the
moonlit
background
of
the
shenandoah
valley
i
knew
however
that
in
the
eighteen
years
since
my
boyhood
visit
everything
had
changed
news
had
come
of
my
aunt
death
and
of
nan
runaway
marriage
against
her
father
wishes
and
of
how
she
too
had
died
without
ever
returning
home
poor
unhappy
nannie
i
was
but
a
boy
of
twelve
when
i
had
seen
her
last
but
she
had
impressed
even
my
unimpressionable
age
with
a
sense
of
her
charm
i
had
heard
that
jeff
the
elder
of
the
two
boys
had
gone
completely
to
the
bad
and
having
broken
with
his
father
had
drifted
off
to
no
one
knew
where
this
to
me
was
the
saddest
news
of
all
jeff
had
been
the
object
of
my
first
case
of
hero
worship
i
knew
that
colonel
gaylord
now
an
old
man
was
living
alone
with
radnor
who
i
understood
had
grown
into
a
fine
young
fellow
all
that
his
brother
had
promised
my
only
remembrance
of
the
colonel
was
of
a
tall
dark
man
who
wore
riding
boots
and
carried
a
heavy
trainer
whip
and
of
whom
i
was
very
much
afraid
my
only
remembrance
of
rad
was
of
a
pretty
little
chap
of
four
eternally
in
mischief
it
was
with
a
mingled
feeling
of
eagerness
and
regret
that
i
looked
forward
to
the
visit
eagerness
to
see
again
the
scenes
which
were
so
pleasantly
associated
with
my
boyhood
and
regret
that
i
must
renew
my
memories
under
such
sadly
changed
conditions
as
i
stepped
from
the
train
a
tall
young
man
of
or
thereabouts
came
forward
to
meet
me
i
should
have
recognized
him
for
radnor
anywhere
so
striking
was
his
resemblance
to
the
brother
i
had
known
he
wore
a
loose
flannel
shirt
and
a
felt
hat
cocked
on
one
side
and
he
looked
so
exactly
the
typical
southern
man
of
the
stage
that
i
almost
laughed
as
i
greeted
him
his
welcome
was
frank
and
cordial
and
i
liked
him
from
the
first
he
asked
after
my
health
with
an
amused
twinkle
in
his
eyes
nervous
prostration
evidently
struck
him
as
humorously
as
it
did
terry
lest
i
resent
his
apparent
lack
of
sympathy
however
he
added
with
a
hearty
whack
on
my
shoulder
that
i
had
come
to
the
right
place
to
get
cured
a
drive
over
sweet
smelling
country
roads
behind
blooded
horses
was
a
new
experience
to
me
fresh
from
city
streets
and
the
rumble
of
elevated
trains
i
leaned
back
with
a
sigh
of
content
feeling
already
as
if
i
had
got
my
boyhood
back
again
radnor
enlivened
the
three
miles
with
stories
of
the
houses
we
passed
and
the
people
who
lived
in
them
and
to
my
northern
ears
the
recital
indubitably
smacked
of
the
south
this
old
gentleman
so
rad
called
him
had
kept
an
illicit
still
in
his
cellar
for
fifteen
years
and
it
had
not
been
discovered
until
after
his
death
of
delirium
tremens
the
young
lady
who
lived
in
that
house
one
of
the
belles
of
the
county
had
eloped
with
the
best
man
on
the
night
before
the
wedding
and
the
rightful
groom
had
shot
himself
the
one
who
lived
here
had
eloped
with
her
father
overseer
and
had
rowed
across
the
river
in
the
only
available
boat
leaving
her
outraged
parent
on
the
opposite
bank
i
finally
burst
out
laughing
does
everyone
in
the
south
run
away
to
get
married
do
you
ever
have
any
legitimate
weddings
with
cake
and
rice
and
old
shoes
as
i
spoke
i
remembered
nannie
and
wondered
if
i
had
touched
on
a
delicate
subject
but
radnor
returned
my
laugh
we
do
have
a
good
many
elopements
he
acknowledged
maybe
there
are
more
cruel
parents
in
the
south
then
he
suddenly
sobered
i
suppose
you
remember
nan
he
inquired
with
an
air
of
hesitation
a
little
i
assented
poor
girl
he
said
i
afraid
she
had
a
pretty
tough
time
best
not
mention
her
to
the
old
gentleman
or
jeff
either
does
the
colonel
still
feel
hard
toward
them
radnor
frowned
slightly
he
does
forgive
he
returned
what
was
the
trouble
with
jeff
i
ventured
i
have
never
heard
any
particulars
he
and
my
father
did
agree
i
do
remember
very
much
about
it
myself
i
was
only
thirteen
when
it
happened
but
i
know
there
was
the
devil
of
a
row
do
you
know
where
he
is
i
asked
radnor
shook
his
head
i
sent
him
some
money
once
or
twice
but
my
father
found
it
out
and
shut
down
on
my
bank
account
i
lost
track
of
him
lately
he
is
in
need
of
money
though
the
last
i
heard
he
was
running
a
gambling
place
in
seattle
it
a
great
pity
i
sighed
he
was
a
fine
chap
when
i
knew
him
radnor
echoed
my
sigh
but
he
did
not
choose
to
follow
up
the
subject
and
we
passed
the
rest
of
the
way
in
silence
until
we
turned
into
the
lane
that
led
to
after
the
manner
of
many
southern
places
the
house
was
situated
well
toward
the
middle
of
the
large
plantation
and
entirely
out
of
sight
from
the
road
the
private
lane
which
led
to
it
was
bordered
by
a
hawthorn
hedge
and
wound
for
half
a
mile
or
so
between
pastures
and
flowering
peach
orchards
i
delightedly
breathed
in
the
fresh
spring
odors
wondering
meanwhile
how
it
was
that
i
had
let
that
happy
virginia
summer
of
my
boyhood
slip
so
entirely
from
my
mind
as
we
rounded
a
clump
of
willow
trees
we
came
in
sight
of
the
house
set
on
a
little
rise
of
ground
and
approached
by
a
rolling
sweep
of
lawn
it
was
a
good
example
of
colonial
white
with
green
blinds
the
broad
brick
floored
veranda
which
extended
the
length
of
the
front
supported
by
lofty
doric
columns
on
the
south
side
a
huge
curved
portico
bulged
out
to
meet
the
driveway
stretching
away
behind
the
house
was
a
sleepy
garden
and
behind
this
screened
by
a
row
of
evergreens
were
clustered
the
barns
and
some
little
distance
to
the
left
in
a
slight
hollow
and
half
hidden
by
an
overgrowth
of
laurels
stood
a
row
of
buildings
the
old
negro
cabins
left
over
from
the
slave
days
it
just
as
i
remember
it
i
exclaimed
delightedly
as
i
noted
one
familiar
object
after
another
nothing
has
changed
nothing
does
change
in
the
south
said
radnor
except
the
people
and
i
suppose
they
change
everywhere
and
those
are
the
deserted
negro
cabins
i
added
my
eye
resting
on
the
cluster
of
gray
roofs
showing
above
the
shrubbery
just
at
present
they
are
not
so
deserted
as
we
should
like
he
returned
with
a
suggestive
undertone
in
his
voice
you
visit
the
plantation
at
an
interesting
time
the
gaylord
has
reappeared
the
gaylord
i
exclaimed
in
astonishment
what
on
earth
is
that
radnor
laughed
one
of
our
godless
ancestors
once
beat
a
slave
to
death
and
his
ghost
comes
back
off
and
on
to
haunt
the
negro
cabins
we
had
heard
anything
of
him
for
a
good
many
years
and
had
almost
forgotten
the
story
when
last
week
he
reappeared
devil
fires
have
been
seen
dancing
in
the
laurels
at
night
and
mysterious
moanings
have
been
heard
around
the
cabins
if
you
have
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
negroes
you
can
know
the
state
our
servants
are
in
well
said
i
that
promises
entertainment
i
shall
look
forward
to
meeting
the
we
had
reached
the
house
by
this
time
and
as
we
drew
up
before
the
portico
the
colonel
stood
on
the
top
step
waiting
to
welcome
me
he
was
looking
much
as
i
remembered
him
except
that
his
hair
had
turned
from
black
to
white
and
his
former
imperious
bearing
had
become
a
trifle
querulous
i
jumped
out
and
grasped
his
outstretched
hand
i
glad
to
see
you
my
boy
i
glad
to
see
you
he
said
cordially
my
heart
warmed
toward
the
old
man
my
boy
it
had
been
a
good
many
years
since
anyone
had
called
me
that
you
grown
since
i
saw
you
last
he
chuckled
as
he
led
the
way
into
the
house
through
the
group
of
negro
servants
who
had
gathered
to
see
me
arrive
my
first
fleeting
glimpse
through
the
open
doors
told
me
that
it
was
indeed
true
as
radnor
had
said
nothing
had
changed
the
furniture
was
the
same
solidly
simple
furniture
that
the
house
had
contained
since
it
was
built
i
was
amused
to
see
the
colonel
gloves
and
whip
thrown
carelessly
on
a
chair
in
the
hall
the
whip
was
the
one
token
by
which
i
remembered
him
so
you
been
working
too
hard
have
you
arnold
the
old
man
inquired
looking
me
over
with
twinkling
eyes
we
give
you
something
to
do
that
will
make
you
forget
you
ever
seen
work
before
there
are
half
a
dozen
colts
in
the
pasture
just
spoiling
to
be
broken
in
you
may
try
your
hand
at
that
sir
and
now
i
reckon
supper
about
ready
he
added
nancy
does
allow
any
loitering
when
it
a
question
of
beat
biscuits
take
him
up
to
his
room
rad
and
you
mose
he
called
to
one
of
the
negroes
hanging
about
the
portico
come
and
carry
up
marse
arnold
things
at
this
one
of
them
shambled
forward
and
began
picking
up
my
traps
which
had
been
dumped
in
a
pile
on
the
steps
his
appearance
struck
me
with
such
an
instant
feeling
of
repugnance
that
even
after
i
was
used
to
the
fellow
i
never
quite
overcame
that
first
involuntary
shudder
he
was
not
a
negro
but
an
octoroon
his
color
was
a
muddy
yellow
his
features
were
sharp
instead
of
flat
and
his
hair
hung
across
his
forehead
almost
straight
but
these
facts
alone
did
not
account
for
his
queerness
the
most
uncanny
thing
about
him
was
the
color
of
his
eyes
they
had
a
yellow
glint
and
narrowed
in
the
light
the
creature
was
and
wore
a
faded
suit
of
i
wondered
at
that
for
the
other
servants
who
had
crowded
out
to
see
me
were
dressed
in
very
decent
livery
radnor
noticed
my
surprise
and
remarked
as
he
led
the
way
up
the
winding
staircase
mose
is
much
of
a
beauty
for
a
fact
i
made
no
reply
as
the
man
was
close
behind
and
the
feeling
that
his
eyes
were
boring
into
the
middle
of
my
back
was
far
from
pleasant
but
after
he
had
deposited
his
load
on
the
floor
of
my
room
and
with
a
sidewise
glance
which
seemed
to
take
in
everything
without
looking
directly
at
anything
had
shambled
off
again
i
turned
to
rad
what
the
matter
with
him
i
demanded
radnor
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
you
look
as
if
you
seen
the
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
he
does
bite
the
poor
fellow
half
witted
at
least
in
some
respects
in
others
he
doubly
witted
who
is
he
i
persisted
where
did
he
come
from
oh
he
lived
here
all
his
life
raised
on
the
place
we
as
fond
of
mose
as
if
he
were
a
member
of
the
family
he
my
father
body
servant
and
he
follows
him
around
like
a
dog
we
do
keep
him
dressed
for
the
part
because
shoes
and
stockings
make
him
unhappy
but
his
eyes
i
said
what
the
deuce
is
the
matter
with
his
eyes
radnor
shrugged
his
shoulders
born
that
way
his
eyes
a
little
queer
but
if
you
ever
noticed
it
niggers
eyes
are
often
yellow
the
people
on
the
place
call
him
mose
you
need
be
afraid
of
him
he
added
with
another
laugh
he
harmless
chapter
iii
i
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
we
had
a
sensation
at
supper
that
night
and
i
commenced
to
realize
that
i
was
a
good
many
miles
from
new
york
in
response
to
the
invitation
of
solomon
the
old
negro
butler
we
seated
ourselves
at
the
table
and
commenced
on
the
cold
dishes
before
us
while
he
withdrew
to
bring
in
the
hot
things
from
the
kitchen
as
is
often
the
case
in
southern
plantation
houses
the
kitchen
was
under
a
separate
roof
from
the
main
house
and
connected
with
it
by
a
long
open
gallery
we
waited
some
time
but
no
supper
arrived
the
colonel
becoming
impatient
was
on
the
point
of
going
to
look
for
it
when
the
door
burst
open
and
solomon
appeared
every
hair
on
his
woolly
head
pointing
a
different
direction
de
marse
cunnel
de
he
sperrited
off
de
chicken
right
outen
de
oven
from
under
nancy
eyes
solomon
said
the
colonel
severely
what
are
you
trying
to
say
talk
sense
sho
yuh
bohn
marse
cunnel
it
de
libbin
truf
i
tellin
yuh
dat
has
fotched
dat
chicken
right
outen
de
oven
an
it
vanished
in
de
air
you
go
out
and
bring
that
chicken
in
and
do
let
me
hear
another
word
i
cay
marse
cunnel
i
cay
dere
ai
no
chicken
dere
very
well
then
go
and
get
us
some
ham
and
eggs
and
stop
this
fuss
solomon
withdrew
and
we
three
looked
at
each
other
rad
what
the
meaning
of
this
the
colonel
demanded
querulously
some
foolishness
on
the
part
of
the
niggers
i
look
into
it
after
supper
when
the
begins
abstracting
chickens
from
the
oven
i
think
it
time
to
investigate
being
naturally
curious
over
the
matter
i
commenced
asking
questions
about
the
history
and
prior
appearances
of
the
radnor
answered
readily
enough
but
i
noticed
that
the
colonel
appeared
restless
under
the
inquiry
and
the
amused
suspicion
crossed
my
mind
that
he
did
not
entirely
discredit
the
story
when
a
man
has
been
born
and
brought
up
among
negroes
he
comes
in
spite
of
himself
to
be
tinged
with
their
ideas
supper
finished
the
three
of
us
turned
down
the
gallery
toward
the
kitchen
as
we
approached
the
door
we
heard
a
murmur
of
voices
one
rising
every
now
and
then
in
a
shrill
wail
which
furnished
a
sort
of
chorus
radnor
whispered
in
my
ear
that
he
reckoned
nancy
had
got
um
again
though
i
did
not
comprehend
at
the
moment
i
subsequently
learned
that
um
referred
to
a
sort
of
emotional
ecstasy
into
which
nancy
occasionally
worked
herself
the
motive
power
being
indifferently
ghosts
or
religion
the
kitchen
was
a
large
square
room
with
brick
floor
rough
shack
walls
and
smoky
rafters
overhead
from
which
pended
strings
of
garlic
red
peppers
and
herbs
the
light
was
supplied
ostensibly
by
two
tallow
dips
but
in
reality
by
the
glowing
wood
embers
of
the
great
open
stove
bricked
into
one
side
of
the
wall
five
or
six
excited
negroes
were
grouped
in
a
circle
about
a
woman
with
a
yellow
turban
on
her
head
who
was
rocking
back
and
forth
and
shouting
at
intervals
dere
sperrits
in
de
air
i
can
smell
um
i
can
smell
um
nancy
called
the
colonel
sharply
as
we
stepped
into
the
room
nancy
paused
a
moment
and
turned
upon
us
a
pair
of
frenzied
eyes
with
nothing
much
but
the
whites
showing
marse
cunnel
dere
sperrits
in
de
air
she
cried
sabe
yuhself
while
dere
time
we
all
de
road
to
destruction
you
be
treading
the
road
to
destruction
in
mighty
short
order
if
you
do
keep
still
he
returned
grimly
now
stop
this
foolishness
and
tell
me
what
gone
with
that
chicken
after
a
great
deal
of
questioning
and
patching
together
we
finally
got
her
story
but
i
can
not
say
that
it
threw
much
light
upon
the
matter
she
had
put
the
chicken
in
the
oven
and
then
she
felt
powerful
queer
as
if
something
were
going
to
happen
suddenly
she
felt
a
cold
wind
blow
through
the
room
the
candles
went
out
and
she
could
hear
the
rustle
of
ghostly
gahments
sweeping
past
her
the
oven
door
sprang
open
of
its
own
accord
she
looked
inside
and
dere
no
chicken
dere
repeated
questioning
only
brought
out
the
same
statement
but
with
more
circumstantial
details
the
other
negroes
backed
her
up
and
the
story
grew
rapidly
in
magnitude
and
horror
nancy
seizures
it
appeared
were
contagious
and
the
others
by
this
time
were
almost
as
excited
as
she
the
only
approximately
calm
one
among
them
was
mose
who
sat
in
the
doorway
watching
the
scene
with
half
furtive
eyes
and
something
resembling
a
grin
on
his
face
the
colonel
observing
that
it
was
a
good
deal
of
commotion
for
the
sake
of
one
small
chicken
disgustedly
dropped
the
inquiry
as
we
stepped
out
into
the
gallery
again
i
glanced
back
at
the
dancing
firelight
the
weird
cross
shadows
and
the
circle
of
dusky
faces
with
i
confess
a
somewhat
creepy
feeling
i
could
see
that
in
such
an
atmosphere
it
would
not
take
long
for
superstition
to
lay
its
hold
on
a
man
what
the
meaning
of
it
i
asked
as
we
strolled
slowly
toward
the
house
the
meaning
of
it
radnor
shrugged
is
that
some
of
them
are
lying
the
i
could
swear
has
a
good
flesh
and
blood
appetite
nancy
has
been
frightened
and
she
believes
her
own
story
there
never
any
use
in
trying
to
sift
a
negro
lies
they
have
so
much
imagination
that
after
five
minutes
they
believe
themselves
i
think
i
could
spot
the
ghost
i
returned
and
that
your
precious
mose
radnor
shook
his
head
mose
does
need
to
steal
chickens
he
gets
all
he
wants
mose
the
colonel
added
emphatically
is
the
one
person
on
the
place
who
is
absolutely
to
be
trusted
we
had
almost
reached
the
house
when
we
were
suddenly
startled
by
a
series
of
shrieks
and
screams
coming
toward
us
across
the
open
stretch
of
lawn
that
lay
between
us
and
the
old
negro
cabins
in
another
moment
an
old
woman
her
face
twitching
with
terror
had
thrown
herself
at
our
feet
in
a
species
of
convulsion
de
de
he
was
all
we
could
make
out
between
her
moans
the
other
negroes
came
pouring
out
from
the
kitchen
and
gathered
in
a
frenzied
circle
about
the
writhing
woman
mose
i
noted
was
among
them
he
could
at
least
prove
an
alibi
this
time
here
mose
quick
get
us
some
torches
radnor
called
we
fetch
that
up
here
to
answer
for
it
old
aunt
sukie
he
added
to
me
nodding
toward
the
woman
on
the
ground
whose
spasms
by
this
time
were
growing
somewhat
quieter
she
lives
on
the
next
plantation
and
was
probably
taking
a
cross
cut
through
the
laurel
path
that
leads
by
the
cabins
she
almost
a
hundred
and
is
pretty
nearly
a
witch
herself
mose
shambled
up
with
some
torches
pine
knots
dipped
in
tar
such
as
they
used
for
hunting
at
night
and
he
and
i
and
radnor
set
out
for
the
cabins
i
noticed
that
none
of
the
other
negroes
volunteered
to
assist
i
also
noticed
that
mose
went
on
ahead
with
a
low
whining
cry
which
sent
chills
chasing
up
and
down
my
back
what
the
matter
with
him
i
gasped
more
intent
on
the
negro
than
the
ghost
we
had
come
to
search
that
the
way
he
always
hunts
radnor
laughed
there
are
a
good
many
things
about
mose
that
you
will
have
to
get
used
to
we
searched
the
whole
region
of
the
abandoned
quarters
with
a
considerable
degree
of
thoroughness
three
or
four
of
the
larger
cabins
were
used
as
store
houses
for
fodder
the
rest
were
empty
we
poked
into
all
of
them
but
found
nothing
more
terrifying
than
a
few
bats
and
owls
though
i
did
not
give
much
consideration
to
the
fact
at
the
time
i
later
remembered
that
there
was
one
of
the
cabins
which
we
explore
as
thoroughly
as
the
rest
mose
dropped
his
torch
as
we
entered
and
in
the
confusion
of
relighting
it
the
interior
was
somewhat
slighted
in
any
case
we
unearthed
no
that
night
and
we
finally
gave
up
the
search
and
turned
back
to
the
house
i
suspect
radnor
laughed
that
if
the
truth
were
known
old
aunt
sukie
beckoning
would
turn
out
to
be
nothing
more
alarming
than
a
white
cow
waving
her
tail
it
rather
suggestive
coming
on
top
of
the
chicken
episode
i
observed
oh
this
wo
be
the
end
we
have
served
for
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
during
the
rest
of
your
stay
when
the
niggers
begin
to
see
things
they
keep
it
up
when
i
went
upstairs
that
night
rad
followed
close
on
my
heels
to
see
that
i
had
everything
i
needed
the
room
was
a
huge
four
windowed
affair
furnished
with
a
canopied
bed
and
a
mahogany
wardrobe
as
big
as
a
small
house
the
nights
still
being
chilly
a
roaring
wood
fire
had
been
built
adding
a
note
of
cheerfulness
to
an
otherwise
sombre
apartment
this
was
nan
room
he
said
suddenly
nan
room
i
echoed
glancing
about
the
shadowy
interior
rather
heavy
for
a
girl
it
is
a
trifle
severe
he
agreed
but
i
dare
say
it
was
different
when
she
was
here
her
things
are
all
packed
away
in
the
attic
he
picked
up
a
candle
and
held
it
so
that
it
lighted
the
face
of
a
portrait
over
the
mantle
that
nan
painted
when
she
was
eighteen
yes
i
nodded
i
recognized
her
the
moment
i
saw
it
she
was
like
that
when
i
knew
her
it
used
to
hang
down
stairs
but
after
her
marriage
my
father
had
it
brought
up
here
he
kept
the
door
locked
until
the
news
came
that
she
was
dead
then
he
turned
it
into
a
guest
room
he
never
comes
in
himself
he
wo
look
at
the
picture
radnor
spoke
shortly
but
with
an
underlying
note
of
bitterness
i
could
see
that
he
felt
keenly
on
the
subject
after
a
few
desultory
words
he
somewhat
brusquely
said
good
night
and
left
me
to
the
memories
of
the
place
instead
of
going
to
bed
i
set
about
unpacking
i
was
tired
but
wide
awake
aunt
sukie
convulsions
and
our
torch
light
hunt
for
ghosts
were
novel
events
in
my
experience
and
they
acted
as
anything
but
a
sedative
the
unpacking
finished
i
settled
myself
in
an
easy
chair
before
the
fire
and
fell
to
studying
the
portrait
it
was
a
huge
canvas
in
the
romantic
fashion
of
romney
with
a
landscape
in
the
background
the
girl
was
dressed
in
flowing
pink
drapery
a
garden
hat
filled
with
roses
swinging
from
her
arm
a
scotch
collie
with
great
lustrous
eyes
pressed
against
her
side
the
pose
the
attributes
were
artificial
but
the
painter
had
caught
the
spirit
nannie
face
looked
out
of
the
frame
as
i
remembered
it
from
long
ago
youth
and
gaiety
and
goodness
trembled
on
her
lips
and
laughed
in
her
eyes
the
picture
seemed
a
prophecy
of
all
the
happiness
the
future
was
to
bring
nannie
at
eighteen
with
life
before
her
and
three
years
later
she
was
dying
in
a
dreary
little
western
town
separated
from
her
girlhood
friends
without
a
word
of
forgiveness
from
her
father
what
had
she
done
to
deserve
this
fate
merely
set
up
her
will
against
his
and
married
the
man
she
loved
her
husband
was
poor
but
from
all
i
ever
heard
a
very
decent
chap
as
i
studied
the
eager
smiling
face
i
felt
a
hot
wave
of
anger
against
her
father
what
a
power
of
vindictiveness
the
man
must
have
still
to
cherish
rancour
against
a
daughter
fifteen
years
in
her
grave
there
was
something
too
poignantly
sad
about
the
unfulfilled
hope
of
the
picture
i
blew
out
the
candles
to
rid
my
mind
of
poor
little
nannie
smile
i
sat
for
some
time
my
eyes
fixed
moodily
on
the
glowing
embers
till
i
was
roused
by
the
deep
boom
of
the
hall
clock
as
it
slowly
counted
twelve
i
rose
with
a
laugh
and
a
yawn
the
first
of
the
doctor
orders
had
been
early
to
bed
i
hastily
made
ready
but
before
turning
in
paused
for
a
moment
by
the
open
window
enticed
by
the
fresh
country
smells
of
plowed
land
and
sprouting
green
things
that
blew
in
on
the
damp
breeze
it
was
a
wild
night
with
a
young
moon
hanging
low
in
the
sky
shadows
chased
themselves
over
the
lawn
and
the
trees
waved
and
shifted
in
the
wind
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
i
had
looked
out
on
such
a
scene
of
peaceful
tranquillity
as
this
new
york
with
the
hurry
and
rush
of
its
streets
with
the
horrors
of
terry
morgue
seemed
to
lie
in
another
continent
but
suddenly
i
was
recalled
to
the
present
by
hearing
almost
beneath
me
the
low
shuddering
squeak
of
an
opening
window
i
leaned
out
silently
alert
and
to
my
surprise
i
saw
mose
though
it
was
pretty
dark
i
could
not
be
mistaken
in
his
long
loping
run
slink
out
from
the
shadow
of
the
house
and
make
across
the
open
space
of
lawn
toward
the
deserted
negro
cabins
as
he
ran
he
was
bent
almost
double
over
a
large
black
bundle
which
he
carried
in
his
arms
though
i
strained
my
eyes
to
follow
him
i
could
make
out
nothing
more
before
he
had
plunged
into
the
shadow
of
the
laurels
chapter
iv
the
grows
mysterious
i
waked
early
and
hurried
through
with
my
dressing
eager
to
get
down
stairs
and
report
my
last
night
finding
in
regard
to
mose
my
first
impulse
had
been
to
rouse
the
house
but
on
soberer
second
thoughts
i
had
decided
to
wait
till
morning
i
was
glad
now
that
i
had
for
with
the
sunlight
streaming
in
through
the
eastern
windows
with
the
fresh
breeze
bringing
the
sound
of
twittering
birds
life
seemed
a
more
cheerful
affair
than
it
had
the
night
before
and
the
whole
aspect
of
the
took
on
a
distinctly
humorous
tone
a
ghost
who
wafted
roast
chickens
through
the
air
and
out
of
doors
on
a
breeze
of
its
own
constructing
appealed
to
me
as
having
an
original
mind
since
my
midnight
discovery
i
felt
pretty
certain
that
i
could
identify
the
ghost
and
as
i
recalled
the
masterly
way
in
which
mose
had
led
and
directed
the
hunt
i
decided
that
he
was
cleverer
than
rad
had
given
him
credit
for
i
went
down
stairs
with
my
eyes
and
ears
wide
open
prepared
for
further
revelations
the
problems
of
my
profession
had
never
led
me
into
any
consideration
of
the
supernatural
and
the
rather
evanescent
business
of
hunting
down
a
came
as
a
welcome
contrast
to
the
very
material
details
of
my
recent
forgery
case
i
had
found
what
terry
would
call
a
it
was
still
early
and
neither
the
colonel
nor
radnor
had
appeared
but
solomon
was
sweeping
off
the
portico
steps
and
i
addressed
myself
to
him
he
was
rather
coy
at
first
about
discussing
the
matter
of
the
as
he
scented
my
scepticism
but
in
the
end
he
volunteered
some
says
de
a
woman
dat
one
o
de
gaylords
long
time
ago
should
o
married

that
what
the
matter
with
mose
i
pursued
tentatively
does
he
consort
with
ghosts
mose
was
bawn
dat
way
but
i
reckon
maybe
dat
was
what
was
de
matter
wid
his
mudder
an
he
cotched
it
that
was
rather
an
unusual
thing
last
night
was
it
for
a
to
steal
a
chicken
like
must
have
dere
jokes
like
odder
folkses
was
as
far
as
solomon
would
go
at
breakfast
i
repeated
what
i
had
seen
the
night
before
and
to
my
indignation
both
radnor
and
my
uncle
took
it
calmly
mose
is
only
a
poor
half
witted
fellow
but
he
as
honest
as
the
day
the
colonel
declared
and
i
wo
have
him
turned
into
a
villain
for
your
entertainment
he
may
be
honest
i
persisted
but
just
the
same
he
knows
what
became
of
that
chicken
and
what
more
if
you
look
about
the
house
find
there
something
else
missing
the
colonel
laughed
if
it
raises
your
suspicions
to
have
mose
prowling
around
in
the
night
you
have
to
get
used
to
suspicions
for
you
have
during
the
rest
of
your
stay
i
known
mose
to
stop
out
in
the
woods
for
three
nights
running
he
as
much
an
animal
as
he
is
a
man
but
he
a
tame
animal
and
you
need
be
afraid
of
him
if
you
followed
him
and
his
bundle
last
night
i
reckon
you
have
made
a
mighty
queer
discovery
he
has
his
own
little
amusements
and
they
are
exactly
ours
but
since
he
does
hurt
anybody
what
the
use
in
bothering
i
known
mose
for
well
on
to
thirty
years
and
i
never
yet
known
him
to
do
a
meanness
to
any
human
being
there
are
many
white
folks
i
can
say
the
same
of
i
did
not
pursue
the
subject
with
the
colonel
but
i
later
suggested
to
rad
that
we
continue
our
investigation
he
echoed
his
father
laugh
if
we
set
out
to
investigate
all
the
imaginings
that
came
into
the
heads
we
should
have
our
hands
full
was
his
reply
i
dropped
the
matter
for
the
time
being
but
i
was
none
the
less
convinced
that
mose
and
the
ghost
were
near
relations
and
i
determined
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
in
the
future
at
least
in
so
far
as
one
could
keep
an
eye
on
so
slippery
an
individual
in
pursuance
of
this
design
i
took
the
opportunity
that
first
morning
while
rad
and
his
father
were
engaged
with
the
veterinary
surgeon
who
had
come
to
doctor
a
sick
colt
of
strolling
in
the
direction
of
the
deserted
cabins
it
was
a
damp
malarious
looking
spot
though
i
dare
say
in
the
old
days
when
the
land
was
drained
it
had
been
healthy
enough
just
below
the
cabins
lay
the
largest
of
the
four
pools
which
gave
the
plantation
its
name
the
other
three
lying
in
the
pastures
higher
up
were
used
for
watering
the
stock
and
were
kept
clean
and
free
from
plant
growth
but
the
lower
pool
abandoned
like
the
cabins
had
been
allowed
to
overflow
its
banks
until
it
was
completely
surrounded
with
rushes
and
lily
pads
a
rank
growth
of
willow
trees
hung
over
the
water
and
shut
out
all
but
the
merest
glint
of
sunlight
above
this
pool
the
cabins
stretched
in
a
double
row
occupying
the
base
of
the
declivity
on
which
the
big
house
stood
there
were
as
many
as
a
dozen
i
should
think
built
of
logs
and
unpainted
shack
consisting
for
the
most
part
of
a
single
large
room
though
a
few
had
a
loft
above
and
a
rough
in
the
rear
a
walk
bordered
by
laurels
stretched
down
the
center
between
the
two
rows
and
as
the
trees
had
not
been
clipped
for
a
good
many
years
the
shade
was
somewhat
sombre
add
to
this
the
fact
that
one
or
two
of
the
roofs
had
fallen
in
that
the
hinges
were
missing
from
several
doors
that
there
was
not
a
whole
pane
of
glass
in
all
the
dozen
cabins
and
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
the
place
gave
rise
to
no
very
cheerful
fancies
i
wondered
that
the
colonel
did
not
have
the
houses
pulled
down
they
were
not
a
souvenir
of
past
times
which
i
myself
should
have
cared
to
preserve
the
damp
earth
where
the
shade
was
thickest
plainly
showed
the
marks
of
some
made
by
bare
feet
some
by
shoes
but
i
could
not
follow
them
for
more
than
a
yard
or
so
and
i
could
not
be
certain
they
were
not
our
own
traces
of
the
night
before
i
poked
into
every
one
of
the
cabins
but
found
nothing
suspicious
about
their
appearance
i
did
not
to
be
sure
ascend
to
any
of
the
half
dozen
lofts
as
there
were
no
stairs
and
no
suggestion
of
a
ladder
anywhere
about
the
open
traps
however
which
led
to
them
were
so
thickly
festooned
with
spider
webs
and
dirt
that
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
anyone
had
passed
through
for
a
dozen
years
finding
no
sign
of
habitation
either
human
or
spiritual
i
finally
turned
back
to
the
house
with
a
philosophic
shrug
and
the
reflection
that
mose
nocturnal
vagaries
were
no
affair
of
mine
during
the
next
few
days
we
in
the
front
part
of
the
house
heard
only
faint
echoes
of
the
excitement
though
i
believe
that
the
both
past
and
present
was
the
chief
topic
of
conversation
among
the
negroes
not
only
at
but
among
the
neighboring
plantations
as
well
i
spent
my
time
those
first
few
days
in
getting
acquainted
with
my
new
surroundings
the
chief
business
of
the
farm
was
horse
raising
and
the
colonel
kept
a
well
stocked
stable
a
riding
horse
was
put
at
my
disposal
and
in
company
with
radnor
i
explored
the
greater
part
of
the
valley
we
visited
at
a
number
of
houses
in
the
neighborhood
but
there
was
one
in
particular
where
we
stopped
most
frequently
and
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
discover
the
reason
mathers
hall
an
rambling
structure
red
brick
with
white
trimmings
in
style
half
colonial
half
old
english
was
situated
a
mile
or
so
from
the
hall
had
sheltered
three
generations
of
matherses
and
the
fourth
generation
was
growing
up
there
was
a
huge
family
mostly
girls
who
had
married
and
moved
away
to
washington
or
richmond
or
baltimore
they
all
came
back
in
the
summer
however
bringing
their
babies
with
them
and
the
place
was
the
center
of
gaiety
in
the
neighborhood
there
was
just
one
unmarried
daughter
left
polly
nineteen
years
old
and
the
most
heartlessly
charming
young
person
it
has
ever
been
my
misfortune
to
meet
as
is
likely
to
be
the
case
with
the
baby
of
a
large
family
polly
was
thoroughly
spoiled
but
that
fact
did
not
in
the
least
diminish
her
charm
report
had
it
at
the
time
of
my
arrival
that
after
refusing
every
marriageable
man
in
the
county
she
was
now
trying
to
make
up
her
mind
between
jim
mattison
and
radnor
whether
or
not
these
statistics
were
exaggerated
i
can
not
say
but
in
any
case
the
many
other
aspirants
for
her
favor
had
tacitly
dropped
out
of
the
running
and
the
race
was
clearly
between
the
two
it
seemed
to
me
had
i
been
polly
that
it
would
not
take
me
long
to
decide
rad
was
as
likable
a
young
fellow
as
one
would
ever
meet
he
came
from
one
of
the
best
families
in
the
county
with
the
prospect
of
inheriting
at
his
father
death
a
very
fair
sized
fortune
it
struck
me
that
a
girl
would
have
to
search
a
good
while
before
discovering
an
equally
desirable
husband
but
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
this
was
not
the
general
opinion
in
the
neighborhood
radnor
reputation
i
learned
with
something
of
a
shock
was
far
from
what
it
should
have
been
i
was
told
with
a
meaning
undertone
that
he
favored
his
brother
jeff
though
many
of
the
stories
were
doubtless
exaggerated
i
learned
subsequently
that
there
was
too
much
truth
in
some
of
them
it
was
openly
said
that
polly
mathers
would
be
doing
a
great
deal
better
if
she
chose
young
mattison
for
though
he
might
not
have
the
prospect
of
as
much
money
as
radnor
gaylord
he
was
infinitely
the
steadier
of
the
two
mattison
was
a
and
rather
young
giant
but
it
did
not
strike
me
at
the
time
nor
later
in
the
light
of
succeeding
events
that
he
was
particularly
endowed
with
brains
by
way
of
occupation
he
was
described
as
being
in
politics
at
that
time
he
was
sheriff
of
the
county
and
was
fully
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
office
i
fear
that
polly
had
a
good
deal
of
the
coquette
in
her
and
she
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
jealousy
between
the
two
young
men
whenever
radnor
by
any
chance
incurred
her
displeasure
she
retaliated
by
transferring
her
smiles
to
mattison
and
the
virtuous
young
sheriff
took
good
care
that
if
rad
committed
any
slips
polly
should
hear
of
them
as
a
result
they
succeeded
in
keeping
his
temper
in
a
very
inflammable
state
i
had
not
been
long
at
before
i
commenced
to
see
that
there
was
an
undercurrent
to
the
life
of
the
household
which
i
had
not
at
first
suspected
the
colonel
had
grown
strict
as
he
grew
old
his
experience
with
his
elder
son
had
made
him
bitter
and
he
did
not
adopt
the
most
diplomatic
way
of
dealing
with
radnor
the
boy
had
inherited
a
good
share
of
his
father
stubborn
temper
and
indomitable
will
the
two
living
alone
inevitably
clashed
radnor
at
times
seemed
possessed
of
the
very
devil
of
perversity
and
if
he
ever
drank
or
gambled
it
was
as
much
to
assert
his
independence
as
for
any
other
reason
there
were
days
when
he
and
his
father
were
barely
on
speaking
terms
life
at
the
plantation
however
was
for
the
most
part
and
flexible
as
is
likely
to
be
the
case
in
a
bachelor
establishment
we
dropped
cigar
ashes
anywhere
we
pleased
cocked
our
feet
on
the
parlor
table
if
we
saw
fit
and
let
the
dogs
troop
all
over
the
place
i
spent
the
greater
part
of
my
time
on
horseback
riding
about
the
country
with
radnor
on
business
for
the
farm
he
i
soon
discovered
did
most
of
the
actual
work
though
his
father
was
still
the
nominal
head
of
affairs
the
raising
of
is
no
longer
the
lucrative
business
that
it
used
to
be
and
it
required
a
good
manager
to
bring
the
balance
out
on
the
right
side
of
the
ledger
rad
was
such
a
spectacular
looking
young
fellow
that
i
was
really
surprised
to
find
what
sound
business
judgment
he
possessed
he
insisted
upon
introducing
modern
methods
where
his
father
would
have
been
content
to
drift
along
in
the
casual
manner
of
the
old
south
and
his
more
than
doubled
the
income
of
the
place
in
the
healthy
life
i
soon
forgot
that
nerves
existed
the
only
thing
which
at
all
marred
the
enjoyment
of
those
first
few
days
was
the
knowledge
of
occasional
clashings
between
radnor
and
his
father
i
think
that
they
were
both
rather
ashamed
of
these
outbreaks
and
i
noticed
that
they
tried
to
conceal
the
fact
from
me
by
an
elaborate
if
somewhat
stiff
courtesy
toward
each
other
in
order
to
make
clear
the
puzzling
series
of
events
which
followed
i
must
go
back
to
i
believe
the
fifth
night
of
my
arrival
radnor
was
giving
a
dance
at
for
the
purpose
he
said
of
introducing
me
into
society
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
polly
mathers
was
the
guest
of
honor
in
any
case
the
party
was
given
and
everyone
in
the
neighborhood
the
term
neighborhood
is
broad
in
virginia
it
describes
a
ten
mile
radius
both
young
and
old
came
in
carriages
or
on
horseback
the
younger
ones
to
dance
half
the
night
the
older
ones
to
play
cards
and
look
on
i
met
a
great
many
pretty
girls
that
evening
the
south
deserves
its
reputation
but
polly
mathers
was
by
far
the
prettiest
and
the
contest
for
her
favors
between
radnor
and
young
mattison
was
spirited
and
open
had
rad
consulted
his
private
wishes
the
sheriff
would
not
have
been
among
the
guests
it
was
getting
on
toward
the
end
of
the
evening
and
the
musicians
a
band
of
negro
fiddlers
made
up
from
the
different
plantations
were
resting
after
a
virginia
reel
that
had
been
more
a
romp
than
a
dance
when
someone
i
think
it
was
polly
herself
suggested
that
the
company
adjourn
to
the
laurel
walk
to
see
if
the
were
visible
the
story
of
old
aunt
sukie
convulsions
and
of
the
spirited
roast
chicken
had
spread
through
the
countryside
and
there
had
been
a
good
many
laughing
allusions
to
it
during
the
evening
running
upstairs
in
search
of
a
hat
i
met
rad
on
the
landing
buttoning
something
white
inside
his
coat
something
that
to
my
eyes
looked
suspiciously
like
a
sheet
he
laughed
and
put
his
finger
on
his
lips
as
he
went
on
down
to
join
the
others
it
was
a
bright
moonlight
night
almost
as
light
as
day
we
moved
across
the
open
lawn
in
a
fairly
compact
body
the
girls
though
they
had
been
laughing
all
the
evening
at
the
exploits
of
the
showed
a
cautious
tendency
to
keep
on
the
inside
rad
was
in
the
front
ranks
leading
the
hunt
but
i
noticed
as
we
entered
the
shrubbery
that
he
disappeared
among
the
shadows
and
i
for
one
was
fairly
certain
that
our
search
would
be
rewarded
we
paused
in
a
group
at
the
nearer
end
of
the
row
of
cabins
and
stood
waiting
for
the
to
show
himself
he
was
obliging
four
or
five
minutes
and
a
faint
flutter
of
white
appeared
in
the
distance
at
the
farther
end
of
the
laurel
walk
then
as
we
stood
with
expectant
eyes
fixed
on
the
spot
we
saw
a
tall
white
figure
sway
across
a
patch
of
moonlight
with
a
beckoning
gesture
in
our
direction
while
the
breeze
bore
a
faintly
whispered
come
come
we
were
none
of
us
overbold
our
faith
was
not
strong
enough
to
run
the
risk
of
spoiling
the
illusion
with
shrieks
and
laughter
we
turned
and
made
for
the
house
breaking
in
among
the
elder
members
of
the
party
with
the
panting
announcement
we
seen
the
polly
loitered
on
the
veranda
while
supper
was
being
served
waiting
i
suspect
for
radnor
to
reappear
i
joined
her
very
willing
indeed
that
the
young
man
should
delay
polly
her
white
dress
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
her
eyes
filled
with
laughter
her
cheeks
glowing
with
excitement
was
the
most
entrancing
little
creature
i
have
ever
seen
she
was
so
bubbling
over
with
youth
and
that
i
felt
in
contrast
as
if
i
were
already
tottering
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
i
was
just
thirty
that
summer
but
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
i
shall
never
feel
so
old
again
well
solomon
i
remarked
as
i
helped
myself
to
some
cakes
he
was
passing
we
been
consorting
with
ghosts
tonight
i
reckon
dis
yere
gohs
would
answer
to
de
name
o
marse
radnah
said
solomon
with
a
wise
shake
of
his
head
but
just
de
same
it
ai
safe
to
mock
at
dey
get
it
back
at
you
when
you
ai
it
after
an
intermission
of
half
an
hour
or
so
the
music
commenced
again
but
still
no
radnor
polly
cast
more
than
one
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
laurels
and
the
sparkle
in
her
eyes
grew
ominous
presently
young
mattison
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
asked
her
to
come
in
and
dance
but
she
said
that
she
was
tired
and
we
three
stood
laughing
and
chatting
for
some
ten
minutes
longer
when
a
step
suddenly
sounded
on
the
gravel
path
and
radnor
rounded
the
corner
of
the
house
as
the
bright
moonlight
fell
on
his
face
i
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
he
was
pale
to
his
very
lips
and
there
were
strained
anxious
lines
beneath
his
eyes
what
the
matter
radnor
polly
cried
you
look
as
if
you
found
the
he
made
an
effort
at
composure
and
laughed
in
return
though
to
my
ears
the
laugh
sounded
very
hollow
i
believe
this
is
my
dance
is
it
polly
he
asked
joining
us
with
rather
an
air
of
carelessness
your
dance
was
over
half
an
hour
ago
polly
returned
this
is
mr
mattison
she
turned
indoors
with
the
young
man
and
rad
following
on
their
heels
made
his
way
to
the
punch
bowl
where
i
saw
him
toss
off
three
or
four
glasses
with
no
visible
interval
between
them
i
decidedly
puzzled
watched
him
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
he
appeared
to
have
some
disturbing
matter
on
his
mind
and
his
gaiety
was
clearly
forced
it
was
well
on
toward
morning
when
the
party
broke
up
and
after
some
slight
conversation
of
a
desultory
sort
the
colonel
rad
and
i
went
up
to
our
rooms
whether
it
was
the
excitement
of
the
evening
or
the
coffee
i
had
drunk
in
any
case
i
was
not
sleepy
i
turned
in
only
to
lie
for
an
hour
or
more
with
my
eyes
wide
open
staring
at
a
patch
of
moonlight
on
the
ceiling
my
old
trouble
of
insomnia
had
overtaken
me
again
i
finally
rose
and
paced
the
floor
in
sheer
desperation
and
then
paused
to
stare
out
of
the
window
at
the
peaceful
moonlit
picture
before
me
suddenly
i
heard
as
on
the
night
of
my
arrival
the
soft
creaking
of
the
french
window
in
the
library
which
opened
on
to
the
veranda
just
below
me
quickly
alert
i
leaned
forward
determined
to
learn
if
possible
the
reason
for
mose
midnight
wanderings
to
my
astonishment
it
was
radnor
who
stepped
out
from
the
shadow
of
the
house
carrying
a
large
black
bundle
in
his
arms
i
clutched
the
frame
of
the
window
and
stared
after
him
in
dumb
amazement
as
he
crossed
the
strip
of
moonlit
lawn
and
plunged
into
the
shadows
of
the
laurel
growth
chapter
v
mose
creates
a
sensation
for
the
next
week
or
so
things
went
rather
strangely
on
the
plantation
i
knew
very
well
that
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
which
i
was
supposed
to
know
nothing
and
i
appeared
politely
unconscious
but
i
wo
say
but
that
i
kept
my
eyes
and
ears
as
wide
open
as
was
possible
without
appearing
to
spy
the
chicken
episode
and
aunt
sukie
convulsions
turned
out
to
be
only
the
beginning
of
the
excitement
scarcely
a
day
passed
without
some
fresh
supernatural
visitation
radnor
over
the
matter
before
the
colonel
and
me
but
with
the
negroes
i
know
that
he
encouraged
rather
than
discouraged
their
fears
until
there
was
not
a
man
on
our
own
or
any
of
the
neighboring
plantations
who
would
have
ventured
to
step
foot
within
the
laurel
walk
either
at
night
or
in
the
daytime
at
least
there
was
only
one
mose
took
the
matter
of
the
without
undue
emotion
a
point
which
struck
me
as
suggestive
for
i
knew
that
mose
was
as
superstitious
as
the
rest
when
the
occasion
warranted
once
at
least
i
saw
radnor
and
mose
in
consultation
and
though
i
did
not
know
the
subject
of
the
conference
my
suspicions
were
very
near
the
surface
i
came
upon
them
in
the
stables
talking
in
low
tones
rad
apparently
explaining
and
mose
listening
with
the
air
of
strained
attention
which
the
slightest
mental
effort
always
called
to
his
face
at
my
appearance
radnor
raised
his
voice
and
added
one
or
two
directions
as
to
how
his
guns
were
to
be
cleaned
it
was
evident
that
the
subject
had
been
changed
everything
that
was
missing
about
the
place
and
there
seemed
to
be
an
abnormal
amount
was
attributed
to
the
i
do
not
doubt
but
that
the
servants
made
the
a
convenient
scapegoat
to
answer
for
their
own
shortcomings
but
still
there
were
several
suggestive
depredations
horse
blankets
from
the
stable
clothes
from
the
line
and
more
edibles
than
roast
chicken
from
nancy
larder
the
climax
of
absurdity
was
reached
when
there
disappeared
a
rather
trashy
french
novel
which
i
had
left
in
the
summer
house
i
asked
solomon
about
it
thinking
that
one
of
the
servants
might
have
brought
it
in
solomon
rolled
his
eyes
and
suggested
that
the
had
cotched
it
i
laughingly
commented
upon
the
occurrence
at
the
supper
table
and
the
next
day
rad
handed
me
the
book
mose
had
found
it
he
said
and
had
brought
it
up
to
his
room
all
of
these
minor
occurrences
were
stretched
over
a
period
of
say
ten
days
after
the
party
and
though
it
gave
me
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
there
was
something
in
the
air
which
i
did
not
understand
i
did
not
let
it
worry
me
unduly
radnor
seemed
to
be
on
the
inside
track
of
whatever
was
going
on
and
he
was
old
enough
to
take
care
of
his
own
affairs
i
knew
that
he
had
more
than
once
visited
the
laurel
walk
after
the
house
was
supposed
to
be
asleep
but
i
kept
this
knowledge
to
myself
and
allowed
no
hint
to
reach
the
colonel
i
had
during
these
first
few
weeks
all
the
opportunity
i
wished
of
studying
mose
character
radnor
was
occupied
a
good
deal
of
the
time
spring
on
a
big
river
plantation
is
a
busy
season
and
as
i
had
professed
myself
fond
of
shooting
the
colonel
turned
me
over
to
the
care
of
mose
had
i
myself
been
choosing
i
should
have
selected
another
guide
but
mose
was
the
best
hunter
on
the
place
and
as
the
colonel
was
quite
untroubled
by
his
vagaries
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
i
might
not
be
equally
confident
in
time
i
grew
used
to
the
fellow
but
i
will
admit
that
at
first
i
accepted
his
services
with
some
honest
trepidation
as
i
watched
him
going
ahead
of
me
crouching
behind
bushes
springing
from
hummock
to
hummock
silent
and
alert
quivering
like
an
animal
in
search
of
prey
my
attention
was
centered
on
him
rather
than
on
any
possible
quarry
i
shall
never
forget
running
across
him
in
the
woods
one
afternoon
when
i
had
gone
out
snipe
shooting
alone
whether
he
had
followed
me
or
whether
we
had
chosen
the
same
vicinity
by
chance
i
do
not
know
but
at
any
rate
as
i
came
out
from
the
underbrush
on
the
edge
of
a
low
swampy
place
i
almost
stepped
on
the
man
he
was
stretched
face
downward
on
the
black
oozy
soil
with
his
arm
buried
in
a
hole
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
why
mose
i
cried
in
amazement
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
here
he
responded
without
raising
his
head
i
aftah
a
snake
sah
i
see
a
big
fat
gahtah
snake
into
dis
yere
hole
an
he
skulkin
dar
now
thinkin
like
he
gwine
to
fool
me
but
he
cay
do
dat
sah
i
got
by
de
tail
an
i
fotch
out
he
drew
forth
as
he
spoke
a
huge
black
and
yellow
snake
writhing
and
hissing
and
proceeded
to
smash
its
head
with
a
stone
i
shut
my
eyes
during
the
operation
and
when
i
opened
them
again
i
saw
to
my
horror
that
he
was
stuffing
the
carcass
in
the
front
of
his
shirt
good
heavens
mose
i
cried
aghast
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
boil
it
into
oil
sah
to
scar
de
witches
off
inquiry
at
the
house
that
night
brought
out
the
fact
that
this
was
one
of
mose
regular
occupations
snake
oil
was
in
general
favor
among
the
negroes
as
a
specific
against
witches
and
mose
was
the
chief
purveyor
of
the
lotion
taken
all
in
all
he
was
about
as
queer
a
human
being
as
i
have
ever
come
across
and
i
fancy
had
i
been
a
psychologist
instead
of
a
lawyer
i
might
have
found
him
an
entertaining
study
i
heard
about
this
time
some
fresh
rumors
in
regard
to
radnor
one
and
it
came
pretty
straight
that
he
just
lost
a
hundred
dollars
at
poker
a
hundred
dollars
may
not
sound
like
a
very
big
loss
in
these
days
of
bridge
but
it
was
large
for
that
place
and
it
represented
to
radnor
exactly
two
months
pay
as
overseer
of
the
plantation
the
colonel
paid
him
six
hundred
dollars
a
year
a
little
enough
sum
considering
the
work
he
did
rad
had
nothing
in
his
own
right
aside
from
his
salary
he
was
entirely
dependent
on
his
father
and
it
struck
me
as
more
than
foolish
for
a
young
man
who
was
contemplating
marriage
to
throw
away
two
earnings
in
a
single
game
of
poker
the
conviction
crossed
my
mind
that
perhaps
after
all
polly
was
wise
to
delay
i
heard
another
rumor
however
which
was
graver
than
the
poker
affair
it
was
only
a
rumor
and
when
traced
to
its
source
turned
out
to
be
nothing
more
tangible
than
somebody
hazarded
guess
but
without
the
slightest
cause
the
same
suspicion
had
already
presented
itself
to
me
and
that
was
that
the
was
a
very
flesh
and
blood
woman
radnor
was
clearly
in
some
sort
of
trouble
he
was
moody
and
irritable
so
sharp
with
the
farm
hands
that
several
of
them
left
and
unusually
taciturn
with
the
colonel
and
me
to
make
matters
worse
polly
mathers
was
treating
him
with
marked
indifference
and
openly
bestowing
her
smiles
upon
mattison
what
the
trouble
was
i
could
only
conjecture
but
i
feared
that
she
too
had
been
hearing
rumors
the
stories
had
been
repeated
and
exaggerated
until
they
contained
no
semblance
of
truth
by
this
time
not
only
the
laurel
walk
was
haunted
but
the
as
well
and
it
soon
became
a
region
of
even
greater
fear
than
the
deserted
cabins
the
was
a
natural
cavity
in
the
side
of
a
hill
a
half
mile
or
so
back
from
the
house
it
was
out
of
this
cavity
that
the
underground
stream
flowed
which
fed
the
pools
and
furnished
such
valuable
irrigation
to
the
place
all
that
part
of
virginia
is
undermined
with
limestone
caverns
and
my
uncle
was
by
no
means
the
only
plantation
that
could
boast
the
distinction
of
a
private
cave
the
entrance
was
half
hidden
among
rugged
boulders
dripping
with
moisture
and
was
not
inviting
i
remembered
chasing
a
rabbit
into
this
cavern
when
i
was
a
boy
and
though
it
would
have
been
an
easy
matter
to
follow
him
i
preferred
to
stay
outside
in
the
sunshine
the
then
was
haunted
this
did
not
strike
me
as
strange
i
rather
wondered
that
it
had
not
been
from
the
first
it
was
a
likely
place
for
ghosts
but
the
thing
which
did
surprise
me
was
the
fact
that
it
was
mose
who
brought
the
news
we
were
sitting
on
the
portico
after
supper
one
night
it
was
almost
dark
and
the
glow
from
our
cigars
was
the
one
visible
point
in
the
scenery
when
mose
came
bounding
across
the
lawn
with
his
peculiar
loping
run
and
fairly
groveled
at
radnor
feet
his
teeth
chattering
with
fear
i
seen
de
marse
rad
de
sho
nuff
all
dressed
in
black
an
risin
outen
de
you
fool
radnor
cried
get
on
your
feet
and
behave
yourself
it
was
de
debbil
mose
chattered
his
face
was
black
an
his
eyes
was
fire
you
been
drinking
mose
radnor
said
sharply
get
off
to
the
quarters
where
you
belong
and
do
let
me
see
you
again
until
you
are
sober
and
he
shunted
the
fellow
out
of
the
way
before
he
had
time
to
say
any
more
i
myself
was
tolerably
certain
that
mose
had
not
been
drinking
that
at
least
was
not
in
the
list
of
his
peculiar
vices
he
appeared
to
be
thoroughly
frightened
if
not
he
was
a
most
consummate
actor
in
the
light
of
what
i
already
knew
i
was
considerably
puzzled
by
this
fresh
manifestation
the
colonel
fretted
and
fumed
up
and
down
the
veranda
muttering
something
about
these
fool
niggers
all
being
alike
he
had
bragged
considerably
about
mose
immunity
in
respect
to
and
i
think
he
was
rather
dashed
at
his
favorite
i
held
my
peace
and
radnor
returned
in
a
few
minutes
rad
said
the
colonel
this
thing
going
too
far
the
whole
place
is
infested
with
ghosts
they
be
invading
the
house
next
and
we
have
a
servant
left
on
the
place
ca
you
do
something
to
stop
it
radnor
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
that
it
was
a
pretty
tough
job
to
lay
a
ghost
when
there
were
twenty
niggers
on
the
place
but
that
he
would
see
what
he
could
do
and
he
presently
drifted
off
again
that
same
night
about
ten
i
was
reading
before
going
to
bed
when
a
knock
sounded
on
the
door
and
radnor
appeared
he
was
unusually
restless
and
ill
at
ease
he
referred
in
a
jesting
fashion
to
the
discussed
some
neighborhood
gossip
and
finally
quite
abruptly
inquired
arnold
can
you
lend
me
some
money
yes
i
said
i
think
so
how
much
do
you
want
a
hundred
dollars
if
you
can
spare
it
fact
is
i
a
little
hard
up
and
i
got
a
bill
to
meet
i
have
some
money
invested
but
i
ca
put
my
hands
on
it
just
this
minute
i
pay
you
in
a
week
or
so
as
soon
as
i
get
some
cash
i
would
ask
you
only
my
father
is
so
blamed
reluctant
about
paying
my
salary
ahead
of
time
i
wrote
out
a
check
and
handed
it
to
him
rad
i
said
you
perfectly
welcome
to
the
money
i
glad
to
accommodate
you
but
if
you
excuse
my
mentioning
it
i
think
you
ought
to
pull
up
a
bit
on
this
poker
business
you
do
earn
so
much
that
if
you
thinking
of
getting
married
you
can
afford
to
throw
any
of
it
i
only
speaking
for
your
good
it
no
affair
of
mine
i
added
as
i
saw
his
face
flush
he
hesitated
a
moment
with
the
check
in
his
hand
i
know
that
he
wanted
to
give
it
back
but
he
was
evidently
too
hard
pressed
oh
keep
the
money
i
said
i
do
want
to
pry
into
your
private
affairs
only
i
laughed
i
do
want
to
see
you
win
out
ahead
of
mattison
and
i
afraid
you
not
going
about
it
the
right
way
thank
you
arnold
he
returned
i
want
to
win
a
great
deal
more
than
you
want
me
to
and
if
it
gambling
you
afraid
of
you
can
ease
your
mind
for
i
sworn
off
it
not
a
poker
debt
i
want
this
money
for
tonight
i
would
be
so
secretive
about
the
business
only
it
concerns
another
person
more
than
me
radnor
i
said
i
heard
an
ugly
rumor
the
other
day
i
heard
that
the
ghost
was
a
live
woman
who
was
living
in
the
deserted
cabins
under
your
connivance
i
did
believe
it
but
just
the
same
it
is
not
a
story
which
you
can
afford
to
have
even
whispered
radnor
raised
his
head
sharply
ah
i
see
his
eyes
wavered
a
moment
and
then
fixed
themselves
miserably
on
my
face
has
has
polly
mathers
heard
that
yes
i
returned
i
fancy
she
has
he
struck
the
table
with
a
quick
flash
of
anger
it
a
damned
lie
and
it
comes
from
jim
mattison
and
now
as
to
the
events
which
followed
during
the
night
i
repeated
them
so
many
times
to
so
many
different
persons
that
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
recall
just
what
were
my
original
sensations
i
went
to
bed
but
i
did
go
to
sleep
this
business
was
getting
on
my
nerves
almost
as
badly
as
the
case
after
a
time
i
heard
someone
let
himself
softly
out
of
the
house
i
knew
well
that
it
was
radnor
and
i
did
get
up
to
look
i
did
want
the
appearance
even
to
myself
of
spying
upon
him
after
three
quarters
of
an
hour
or
so
i
was
suddenly
startled
alert
by
hearing
the
of
a
whippletree
out
on
the
lawn
it
was
the
colonel
buckboard
which
stood
in
need
of
oiling
i
recognized
the
sound
curiosity
was
too
much
for
me
this
time
i
slipped
out
of
bed
and
hurried
to
the
window
it
was
pretty
dark
outside
but
there
was
a
faint
glimmer
of
starlight
whoa
jennie
loo
whoa
i
heard
rad
voice
scarcely
above
a
whisper
and
i
saw
the
outline
of
the
cart
plainly
with
rad
driving
and
either
some
person
or
some
large
bundle
on
the
seat
beside
him
it
was
on
the
side
farthest
from
me
and
was
too
vague
to
be
distinguished
he
made
a
wide
detour
of
the
house
across
the
grass
and
struck
the
driveway
at
the
foot
of
the
lawn
the
reason
for
this
manoeuvre
was
evident
the
gravel
drive
from
the
stables
passed
directly
under
the
window
i
went
back
to
bed
half
worried
half
relieved
i
strongly
suspected
that
this
was
the
end
of
the
ghost
but
i
could
not
help
puzzling
over
the
part
that
radnor
had
played
in
the
little
comedy
if
comedy
it
were
the
stories
that
i
had
heard
about
some
of
his
disreputable
associates
returned
to
my
mind
with
unpleasant
emphasis
i
had
gradually
dozed
off
when
half
waking
half
sleeping
i
heard
the
patter
of
bare
feet
on
the
veranda
floor
the
impression
was
not
distinct
enough
to
arouse
me
and
i
have
never
been
perfectly
sure
that
i
was
not
dreaming
i
do
not
know
how
much
time
elapsed
after
this
i
was
sound
asleep
when
i
was
suddenly
startled
awake
by
a
succession
of
the
most
horrible
screams
i
have
ever
heard
in
an
instant
i
was
on
my
feet
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
striking
a
match
and
lighting
a
candle
i
grabbed
an
umbrella
it
was
the
only
semblance
of
a
weapon
anywhere
at
hand
and
dashed
into
the
hall
the
colonel
door
was
flung
open
at
the
same
instant
and
he
appeared
on
the
threshold
revolver
in
hand
eh
arnold
what
happened
he
cried
i
do
know
i
gasped
i
going
down
to
see
we
tumbled
down
stairs
at
such
a
rate
that
the
candle
went
out
and
we
groped
along
in
total
darkness
toward
the
rear
of
the
house
from
where
the
sounds
were
coming
the
cries
had
died
down
by
this
time
into
a
horrible
inarticulate
wail
half
animal
half
human
i
recognized
the
tones
with
a
cold
thrill
it
was
mose
we
found
him
groveling
on
the
floor
of
the
little
passage
that
led
from
the
to
the
serving
room
i
struck
a
light
and
we
bent
over
him
i
hated
to
look
expecting
from
the
noise
he
was
making
to
find
him
lying
in
a
pool
of
blood
but
he
was
entirely
whole
there
was
no
blood
visible
and
we
could
find
no
broken
bones
apparently
there
was
nothing
the
matter
beyond
fear
and
of
that
he
was
nearly
dead
he
crawled
to
the
colonel
and
clung
to
his
feet
chattering
an
unintelligible
gibberish
his
eyes
rolling
wildly
in
the
dim
light
showed
an
uncanny
yellow
gleam
i
could
see
where
he
got
his
name
the
colonel
own
nerves
were
beginning
to
assert
themselves
and
with
an
oath
he
cuffed
the
fellow
back
to
a
state
of
coherence
stand
up
you
blithering
fool
and
tell
us
what
you
mean
by
raising
such
a
fuss
mose
finally
found
his
tongue
but
we
still
could
make
nothing
of
his
story
he
had
been
out
prospectin
and
when
he
came
in
to
go
to
bed
the
house
servants
slept
in
a
wing
over
the
rear
gallery
he
met
the
face
to
face
standing
in
the
doorway
he
was
so
tall
that
his
head
reached
the
ceiling
and
he
was
so
thin
that
you
could
see
right
through
him
at
the
remembrance
mose
began
to
shiver
again
we
propped
him
up
with
some
whiskey
and
sent
him
off
to
bed
still
twittering
with
terror
the
colonel
was
bent
on
routing
out
radnor
to
share
the
excitement
and
i
with
some
difficulty
restrained
him
knowing
full
well
that
rad
was
not
in
the
house
we
made
a
search
of
the
premises
to
assure
ourselves
that
there
was
nothing
tangible
about
mose
but
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
the
colonel
safely
upstairs
again
that
our
search
was
somewhat
cursory
we
both
overlooked
the
little
office
that
opened
off
the
in
spite
of
my
manoeuvres
the
colonel
entered
the
library
first
and
discovered
that
the
french
window
was
open
he
laid
no
stress
on
this
however
supposing
that
mose
was
the
guilty
one
he
bolted
it
with
unusual
care
and
i
with
equal
care
slipped
back
and
unbolted
it
i
finally
persuaded
him
that
mose
was
merely
the
result
of
a
fevered
imagination
fed
on
a
two
weeks
diet
of
ghost
stories
and
succeeded
in
getting
him
back
to
bed
without
discovering
absence
i
lay
awake
until
i
heard
the
sound
of
carriage
wheels
returning
across
the
lawn
and
a
few
minutes
later
footsteps
enter
the
house
and
upstairs
then
as
daylight
was
beginning
to
show
in
the
east
i
finally
fell
asleep
worn
out
with
puzzling
my
head
for
an
explanation
which
should
cover
at
once
rad
nocturnal
drive
and
chapter
vi
we
send
for
a
detective
i
slept
late
the
next
morning
and
came
down
stairs
to
find
the
colonel
pacing
the
length
of
the
his
head
bent
a
worried
frown
upon
his
brow
he
came
to
a
sudden
halt
at
my
appearance
and
regarded
me
a
moment
without
speaking
i
could
see
that
something
of
moment
had
happened
but
i
could
fathom
nothing
of
its
nature
from
his
expression
good
morning
arnold
he
said
with
a
certain
grim
pleasantness
i
have
just
been
making
a
discovery
it
appears
that
mose
amounted
to
more
than
we
gave
him
credit
for
the
safe
was
robbed
during
the
night
the
safe
robbed
i
cried
how
much
was
taken
something
over
a
hundred
dollars
in
cash
and
a
number
of
important
papers
he
threw
open
the
door
of
the
little
office
and
waved
his
hand
toward
the
safe
which
occupied
one
end
the
two
iron
doors
were
wide
open
the
interior
showing
a
succession
of
yawning
pigeon
holes
with
the
cash
drawer
half
pulled
out
and
empty
several
papers
were
spilled
on
the
floor
underneath
he
evidently
had
no
use
for
my
will
nor
for
kennisburg
street
railway
stock
i
do
blame
him
it
would
sell
for
the
paper
it
written
on
radnor
step
sounded
on
the
stair
as
he
came
running
down
whistling
i
noted
ah
rad
the
colonel
called
from
the
office
doorway
you
a
good
sleeper
radnor
stopped
his
whistle
as
his
eye
fell
upon
our
faces
and
his
own
took
on
a
look
of
anxiety
what
the
matter
he
asked
has
anything
happened
it
appears
the
has
robbed
the
safe
the
rad
face
went
visibly
white
and
then
in
a
moment
it
cleared
his
expression
was
divided
between
relief
and
dismay
oh
he
said
you
missed
the
money
i
meant
to
get
down
first
and
tell
you
about
it
but
overslept
i
took
a
hundred
dollars
out
of
the
safe
last
night
because
i
wanted
the
cash
you
had
gone
to
bed
so
i
did
say
anything
about
it
i
will
ride
into
the
village
this
morning
and
get
it
out
of
the
bank
in
time
to
pay
the
men
you
took
a
hundred
dollars
the
colonel
repeated
and
did
you
take
the
securities
also
and
the
bag
of
coin
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
safe
radnor
eye
followed
and
his
jaw
dropped
i
did
touch
anything
but
the
roll
of
bills
in
the
cash
drawer
what
missing
five
thousand
dollars
in
bonds
a
couple
of
insurance
policies
and
one
or
two
deeds
also
the
bag
of
coin
mose
saw
the
in
the
night
and
arnold
and
i
came
down
to
investigate
we
unfortunately
neglected
the
office
in
our
search
or
we
might
have
cornered
him
do
you
happen
to
remember
whether
or
not
you
closed
the
safe
after
you
took
out
the
money
and
would
you
mind
telling
me
why
you
needed
a
hundred
dollars
in
such
a
hurry
that
you
could
wait
until
the
bank
opened
the
troubled
line
on
radnor
brow
deepened
i
think
i
closed
the
safe
he
said
but
i
do
remember
it
barely
possible
that
i
did
lock
it
you
know
we
have
always
kept
it
locked
especially
when
there
was
money
in
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
anyone
would
steal
the
bonds
i
ca
imagine
what
it
means
you
have
answered
my
why
did
you
need
a
hundred
dollars
in
cash
after
ten
last
night
i
am
sorry
father
but
i
ca
answer
that
question
it
a
private
matter
indeed
you
are
sure
that
you
did
not
take
the
bonds
as
well
and
have
forgotten
it
i
took
one
hundred
dollars
in
bills
and
nothing
else
i
took
that
merely
because
it
was
my
only
way
of
cashing
a
check
i
have
frequently
cashed
my
private
checks
when
we
had
a
surplus
on
hand
and
i
want
the
bother
of
going
in
to
the
bank
so
long
as
i
balance
the
books
all
right
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
not
do
so
h
said
the
colonel
two
days
ago
you
came
to
me
and
wanted
two
months
pay
in
advance
because
you
had
overdrawn
your
bank
account
and
i
refused
to
give
it
to
you
where
may
i
ask
were
you
intending
to
get
the
hundred
dollars
to
pay
back
this
amount
a
quick
flush
spread
over
radnor
face
i
already
had
it
arnold
will
tell
you
that
for
i
borrowed
it
of
him
certainly
i
put
in
pacifically
that
all
settled
between
rad
and
me
i
have
his
note
and
was
glad
to
accommodate
him
do
you
get
enough
from
me
that
you
must
ask
the
guests
in
my
house
to
supply
you
with
money
radnor
flush
deepened
but
he
said
nothing
i
could
see
by
his
eyes
however
that
he
would
not
stand
much
more
then
after
you
had
helped
yourself
to
the
money
the
bonds
were
stolen
by
someone
else
said
the
colonel
so
it
appears
said
radnor
and
have
you
any
theory
as
to
the
identity
of
the
thief
rad
hesitated
a
visible
instant
before
replying
the
flush
left
his
face
and
the
pallor
came
back
but
in
the
end
he
raised
his
eyes
and
answered
steadily
no
father
i
have
not
i
am
as
much
mystified
as
you
are
and
you
heard
nothing
in
the
night
as
i
said
before
you
are
an
excellent
sleeper
rad
caught
an
ironical
undertone
in
his
father
voice
i
do
understand
he
said
i
am
a
trifle
deaf
myself
but
still
he
wakened
it
strange
that
you
should
be
the
only
one
in
the
house
who
could
sleep
through
it
sleep
through
what
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
i
cut
in
hastily
and
explained
our
adventure
with
mose
radnor
listened
with
troubled
eyes
but
made
no
comment
at
the
end
his
father
was
watching
him
keenly
and
i
do
know
whether
it
was
intuition
or
some
knowledge
of
the
truth
that
made
him
suddenly
put
the
question
you
were
of
course
in
the
house
all
night
no
radnor
returned
i
was
not
i
did
get
in
till
early
this
morning
and
i
suppose
the
excitement
occurred
during
my
absence
i
suppose
i
may
not
be
permitted
to
inquire
where
you
spent
the
night
that
too
is
a
private
matter
yes
said
radnor
easily
that
too
is
a
private
matter
and
would
throw
no
light
on
the
robbery
none
whatever
solomon
brought
in
the
breakfast
and
we
three
sat
down
but
not
to
a
very
cheerful
meal
the
colonel
wore
an
angry
frown
and
rad
an
air
of
anxious
perplexity
neither
of
them
indulged
in
any
unnecessary
conversation
i
knew
that
the
colonel
was
more
upset
by
his
reticence
than
by
the
robbery
of
the
bonds
and
that
it
was
my
presence
alone
which
restrained
him
from
giving
vent
to
his
anger
as
we
rose
from
the
table
he
said
stiffly
well
rad
have
you
any
suggestion
as
to
how
we
shall
set
to
work
to
track
down
the
thief
radnor
slowly
shook
his
head
i
shall
have
to
talk
with
mose
first
and
find
out
what
he
really
saw
mose
the
colonel
laughed
shortly
he
like
all
the
rest
of
the
niggers
he
does
know
what
he
saw
no
sir
i
had
enough
of
this
business
it
one
thing
when
he
spirits
chickens
from
the
oven
it
another
when
he
takes
to
spiriting
securities
from
the
safe
i
shall
telegraph
to
washington
for
a
first
class
detective
if
you
take
my
advice
said
rad
you
not
do
that
a
not
much
good
outside
the
covers
of
a
book
he
stir
up
a
lot
of
notoriety
and
present
a
bill
and
you
be
no
wiser
than
you
were
before
whoever
stole
those
bonds
will
be
marketing
them
within
a
few
days
the
interest
falls
due
the
first
of
may
i
am
not
so
rich
that
i
can
let
five
thousand
dollars
go
without
a
move
to
get
it
back
i
shall
telegraph
today
for
a
detective
just
as
you
please
said
radnor
with
a
shrug
and
he
turned
toward
the
door
that
opened
on
the
gallery
mose
was
visible
at
the
end
evidently
recounting
to
an
excited
audience
his
experiences
of
the
night
rad
beckoned
to
him
and
the
two
turned
together
across
the
lawn
toward
the
laurel
walk
it
was
an
hour
or
so
later
that
rad
presented
himself
at
my
door
his
colloquy
with
mose
had
increased
rather
than
lessened
the
mystified
look
on
his
face
he
waited
for
no
preliminaries
this
time
but
plunged
immediately
into
the
matter
that
was
on
his
mind
arnold
for
heaven
sake
stop
my
father
from
getting
a
detective
down
here
i
do
dare
say
anything
for
my
opposition
will
only
make
him
do
it
the
more
but
you
have
some
influence
with
him
tell
him
you
a
lawyer
and
will
take
charge
of
it
yourself
why
do
you
want
a
detective
i
asked
good
lord
has
our
family
had
notoriety
enough
here
nan
eloping
with
the
overseer
and
jeff
the
scandal
of
the
county
for
five
years
i
ca
turn
around
but
some
malicious
interpretation
is
put
on
it
and
now
that
the
family
ghost
has
taken
to
cracking
safes
gossip
will
never
stop
get
a
detective
down
here
who
goes
nosing
about
the
neighborhood
in
search
of
information
and
there
no
telling
where
the
thing
will
end
those
bonds
ca
be
far
are
we
more
likely
to
get
at
the
truth
if
we
lie
low
and
do
let
on
we
after
the
thief
radnor
i
said
will
you
tell
me
the
absolute
truth
have
you
any
suspicion
as
to
who
took
those
securities
do
you
know
any
facts
which
might
lead
to
the
apprehension
of
the
thief
he
remained
silent
a
moment
then
he
parried
my
question
with
another
what
time
did
all
that
row
occur
in
the
night
i
do
know
i
did
think
to
look
but
i
should
say
it
was
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
three
i
did
go
to
sleep
again
and
it
was
about
half
an
hour
later
that
you
drove
in
you
heard
me
i
heard
you
go
and
i
heard
you
come
but
i
did
not
mention
that
fact
to
the
colonel
rad
laughed
shortly
i
can
at
least
prove
an
alibi
he
said
you
can
swear
that
i
was
not
mose
devil
he
remained
silent
a
moment
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
chin
in
his
hands
studying
the
floor
then
he
raised
his
eyes
to
mine
with
a
puzzled
shake
of
the
head
no
arnold
i
have
the
slightest
suspicion
as
to
who
took
those
securities
i
ca
make
it
out
the
robbery
must
have
occurred
while
i
was
away
of
course
the
deeds
and
insurance
policies
and
coin
may
have
been
taken
as
a
blind
but
it
queer
the
money
was
in
five
and
ten
cent
pieces
and
pennies
we
always
keep
a
lot
of
change
on
hand
to
pay
the
during
planting
season
there
was
nearly
a
quart
of
it
altogether
and
it
must
have
weighed
a
ton
i
ca
imagine
anyone
stealing
government
and
pennies
at
the
same
haul
did
you
get
any
light
from
mose
i
asked
no
i
ca
make
head
nor
tail
out
of
his
story
he
is
given
to
seeing
visions
and
as
you
know
he
is
afraid
of
the
dark
he
saw
something
that
scared
him
but
what
it
was
i
be
darned
if
i
know
then
why
not
get
a
detective
down
and
see
if
he
ca
find
out
radnor
lowered
his
eyes
a
moment
then
raised
them
frankly
to
mine
oh
hang
it
arnold
i
in
the
deuce
of
a
hole
there
something
else
that
i
do
want
found
out
it
absolutely
unconnected
with
the
robbery
but
you
bring
a
detective
down
here
and
he
certain
to
stumble
on
that
instead
of
the
other
i
tell
you
if
i
could
but
really
i
ca
just
now
it
nothing
i
to
blame
for
my
conduct
lately
has
been
immaculate
you
get
my
father
to
abandon
this
detective
plan
and
we
buckle
down
together
and
root
out
the
truth
about
the
robbery
well
i
promised
i
see
what
i
can
do
but
as
the
colonel
says
five
thousand
dollars
is
a
good
deal
of
money
to
let
slip
through
your
hands
without
making
an
effort
to
get
it
back
you
and
i
will
have
to
finish
the
business
if
we
undertake
it
we
will
he
assured
me
we
can
certainly
get
at
the
truth
better
than
an
outsider
who
does
know
any
of
the
facts
you
switch
off
the
old
gentleman
from
putting
it
in
the
hands
of
the
police
and
everything
will
come
out
right
he
went
off
actually
whistling
again
whatever
had
been
troubling
him
for
the
past
two
weeks
had
been
sloughed
off
during
the
night
and
all
that
remained
now
was
the
danger
of
detection
with
this
removed
he
was
his
old
careless
self
the
loss
of
the
securities
was
apparently
not
bothering
him
radnor
always
did
exhibit
a
lordly
disregard
in
money
matters
i
lost
no
time
in
taking
my
errand
to
the
colonel
but
i
could
discover
him
in
none
of
the
down
stairs
rooms
nor
anywhere
else
about
the
place
it
occurred
to
me
after
half
an
hour
of
searching
to
see
if
his
horse
were
in
the
stable
as
i
had
surmised
it
was
not
he
had
ordered
it
saddled
immediately
after
breakfast
and
had
ridden
off
in
the
direction
of
the
village
one
of
the
informed
me
i
had
my
own
horse
saddled
and
ten
minutes
later
was
riding
after
him
it
surprised
me
that
he
should
have
acted
so
quickly
the
colonel
was
usually
rather
given
to
procrastination
while
rad
was
the
one
who
acted
his
promptness
proved
that
he
was
angry
is
about
two
miles
from
the
village
of
lambert
corners
which
consists
of
a
single
shady
square
two
sides
of
the
square
are
taken
up
with
shops
the
other
two
with
the
school
a
couple
of
churches
and
a
dozen
or
so
of
dwellings
this
composes
as
much
of
the
town
as
is
visible
the
aristocracy
being
scattered
over
the
outlying
plantations
and
regarding
the
corners
merely
as
a
source
of
mail
and
drinks
three
miles
farther
down
the
pike
lies
kennisburg
the
county
seat
which
answers
the
varied
purposes
of
a
metropolis
i
reined
in
before
miller
place
a
spacious
structure
comprising
a
general
store
on
the
right
the
post
and
telegraph
office
on
the
left
and
in
the
rear
a
commodious
room
where
a
white
man
may
quench
his
thirst
a
negro
must
pass
on
to
jake
place
two
doors
below
a
number
of
horses
were
tied
to
the
iron
railing
in
front
and
among
them
i
recognized
red
pepper
i
found
the
colonel
in
the
back
room
a
glass
of
mint
julep
at
his
elbow
an
interested
audience
before
him
he
was
engaged
in
recounting
the
story
of
the
missing
bonds
and
it
was
too
late
for
me
to
interrupt
he
referred
in
the
most
casual
manner
to
the
hundred
dollars
his
son
had
taken
from
the
safe
the
night
before
a
fortunate
circumstance
he
added
or
that
too
would
have
been
stolen
there
was
not
the
slightest
suggestion
in
his
tone
that
he
and
his
son
had
had
any
words
over
this
same
hundred
dollars
the
gaylord
pride
could
be
depended
on
for
hiding
from
the
world
what
the
world
had
no
business
in
knowing
the
telegram
to
the
detective
agency
i
found
had
already
been
dispatched
and
the
colonel
was
awaiting
his
answer
it
came
in
a
few
moments
and
was
delivered
by
word
of
mouth
the
clerk
seeing
no
reason
why
he
should
put
himself
to
the
trouble
of
writing
it
out
they
say
they
put
one
o
their
best
men
on
the
case
colonel
he
get
to
the
junction
at
tonight
the
colonel
and
i
rode
home
together
he
in
a
more
placable
frame
of
mind
though
i
dare
say
he
disliked
as
much
as
ever
the
idea
of
losing
his
bonds
still
the
√©clat
of
a
robbery
of
a
magnitude
that
demanded
a
detective
was
something
of
a
palliative
it
was
not
everyone
of
his
listeners
who
had
five
thousand
dollars
in
bonds
to
lose
i
knew
that
it
would
be
useless
to
try
to
head
off
the
detective
now
and
i
wisely
kept
silent
my
mind
was
by
no
means
at
rest
however
for
an
unknown
reason
i
did
not
want
a
detective
any
more
than
radnor
i
had
the
intangible
feeling
that
there
was
something
in
the
air
which
might
better
not
be
discovered
chapter
vii
we
send
him
back
again
the
detective
came
he
was
an
inoffensive
young
man
and
he
set
to
work
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
the
with
visible
delight
at
the
unusual
nature
of
the
job
radnor
received
him
in
a
spirit
of
almost
anxious
hospitality
a
horse
was
given
him
to
ride
guns
and
fishing
tackle
were
placed
at
his
disposal
a
box
of
the
colonel
best
cigars
stood
on
the
table
of
his
room
and
solomon
at
his
elbow
presented
a
succession
of
ever
freshly
mixed
mint
juleps
i
think
that
he
was
dazed
and
a
trifle
suspicious
at
these
unexpected
attentions
he
was
not
used
to
the
largeness
of
southern
hospitality
however
he
set
to
work
with
an
admirable
zeal
he
interviewed
the
servants
and
and
the
information
he
received
in
regard
to
things
supernatural
would
have
filled
three
volumes
he
was
staggered
by
the
amount
of
evidence
at
hand
rather
than
the
scarcity
he
examined
the
safe
and
the
library
window
with
a
microscope
crawled
about
the
laurel
walk
on
his
hands
and
knees
sent
off
telegrams
and
gossiped
with
the
loungers
at
miller
place
he
interviewed
the
colonel
and
radnor
me
and
wrote
down
always
copious
notes
the
young
man
manner
was
pre√´minently
professional
finally
one
evening
it
was
four
days
after
his
arrival
he
joined
me
as
i
was
strolling
in
the
garden
smoking
an
after
dinner
pipe
may
i
have
just
a
word
with
you
mr
crosby
he
asked
i
am
at
your
service
clancy
said
i
his
manner
was
gravely
portentous
and
prepared
me
for
the
statement
that
was
coming
i
have
spotted
my
man
he
said
i
know
who
stole
the
securities
but
i
am
afraid
that
the
information
will
not
be
welcome
under
the
circumstances
it
seemed
wisest
to
make
my
report
to
you
rather
than
to
colonel
gaylord
and
we
can
decide
between
us
what
is
best
to
do
what
do
you
mean
i
demanded
in
spite
of
my
effort
at
composure
there
was
anxiety
in
my
tone
the
thief
is
radnor
gaylord
i
laughed
that
is
absolutely
untenable
rad
is
incapable
of
such
an
act
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
second
he
was
not
in
the
house
when
the
robbery
occurred
ah
then
you
know
that
and
where
was
he
pray
that
said
i
is
his
own
affair
if
he
did
not
tell
you
it
is
because
it
is
not
connected
with
the
case
so
it
is
just
because
it
connected
with
the
case
that
he
did
not
tell
me
i
will
tell
you
however
where
he
spent
the
night
he
drove
to
kennisburg
a
larger
town
than
lambert
corners
where
an
unusual
letter
would
create
no
comment
and
mailed
the
bonds
to
a
washington
firm
of
brokers
with
whom
he
has
had
some
dealings
he
took
the
bag
of
coin
and
several
unimportant
papers
in
order
to
deflect
suspicion
and
his
opening
the
safe
the
night
before
for
the
hundred
dollars
was
merely
a
ruse
to
allow
him
to
forget
and
leave
it
open
so
that
the
bonds
could
appear
to
be
stolen
by
someone
else
just
what
led
him
to
commit
the
act
i
wo
say
he
has
been
in
a
tight
place
for
several
months
back
in
regard
to
money
last
january
he
turned
a
dollar
mortgage
that
his
father
had
given
him
on
his
birthday
into
cash
and
what
he
did
with
the
cash
i
have
been
able
to
discover
in
any
case
his
father
knows
nothing
of
the
transaction
he
thinks
that
radnor
still
holds
the
mortgage
this
spring
the
young
man
was
hard
up
again
and
no
more
mortgages
left
to
sell
he
probably
did
not
regard
the
appropriation
of
the
bonds
as
stealing
since
everything
by
his
will
was
to
come
to
him
ultimately
as
to
all
this
about
the
that
is
easily
explained
he
needed
a
scapegoat
on
whom
to
turn
the
blame
when
the
bonds
should
disappear
so
he
and
this
mose
between
them
invented
a
ghost
the
negro
is
a
half
crazy
fellow
who
from
the
first
has
been
young
gaylord
tool
i
do
think
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
sufficiently
to
be
blamed
as
for
gaylord
himself
i
fancy
there
was
a
third
person
somewhere
in
the
background
who
was
pressing
him
for
money
and
who
could
be
shaken
off
till
the
money
was
forthcoming
but
whatever
his
motive
for
taking
the
bonds
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
fact
and
i
have
come
to
you
with
the
story
rather
than
to
his
father
it
is
absolutely
impossible
i
returned
radnor
whatever
his
faults
is
an
honorable
man
in
regard
to
money
matters
i
have
his
word
that
he
knows
no
more
about
the
robbery
of
those
bonds
than
i
do
the
detective
laughed
there
is
just
one
kind
of
evidence
that
does
count
for
much
in
my
profession
and
that
is
a
man
word
we
look
for
something
a
little
more
tangible
such
as
this
for
example
he
drew
from
his
pocket
an
envelope
took
from
it
a
letter
and
handed
it
to
me
it
was
a
typewritten
communication
from
a
firm
of
brokers
in
washington
radnor
gaylord
plantation
lambert
corners
we
are
in
receipt
of
your
favor
of
april
in
regard
to
the
sale
of
the
bonds
the
market
is
rather
slow
at
present
and
we
shall
have
to
sell
at
if
you
care
to
hold
on
to
them
a
few
months
longer
there
is
every
chance
of
the
market
picking
up
and
we
feel
sure
that
in
the
end
you
will
find
them
a
good
investment
awaiting
your
further
orders
and
thanking
you
for
past
favors
we
are
very
truly
yours
jacoby
haight
where
did
you
get
hold
of
that
i
asked
it
strikes
me
it
a
private
letter
very
private
the
young
man
agreed
i
had
trouble
enough
in
getting
hold
of
it
i
had
to
do
some
fishing
with
a
hook
and
pole
over
the
transom
of
gaylord
door
he
had
very
kindly
put
the
tackle
at
my
disposal
you
were
called
down
here
to
open
the
family
private
letters
i
said
hotly
i
was
called
down
here
to
find
out
who
stole
colonel
gaylord
bonds
and
i
done
it
i
was
silent
for
a
moment
this
letter
from
the
brokers
staggered
me
april
was
the
date
of
the
robbery
and
i
could
think
of
no
explanation
clancy
noticing
my
silence
elaborated
his
theory
with
a
growing
air
of
triumph
this
mose
was
left
behind
the
night
of
the
robbery
with
orders
to
rouse
the
house
while
radnor
was
away
mose
is
a
good
actor
and
he
fooled
you
the
obvious
suspicion
was
that
the
ghost
had
stolen
the
bonds
and
you
set
out
to
find
him
a
somewhat
difficult
task
as
he
existed
only
in
mose
imagination
i
think
when
you
reflect
upon
the
evidence
you
will
see
that
my
explanation
is
convincing
it
is
in
the
least
convincing
i
retorted
mose
was
not
acting
he
saw
something
that
frightened
him
half
out
of
his
senses
and
that
something
was
not
radnor
masquerading
as
a
ghost
for
radnor
was
out
of
the
house
when
the
robbery
took
place
not
necessarily
the
robbery
took
place
early
in
the
evening
before
all
this
rumpus
occurred
even
if
mose
did
see
a
ghost
the
ghost
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
you
have
absolutely
no
proof
of
that
it
is
nothing
but
surmise
clancy
smiled
with
an
air
of
patient
tolerance
how
about
the
letter
he
inquired
how
do
you
explain
that
i
do
explain
it
it
is
none
of
my
business
but
i
dare
say
radnor
will
do
so
readily
enough
there
he
is
going
toward
the
stables
we
will
call
him
over
no
hold
on
i
have
finished
what
i
want
to
say
i
was
employed
by
colonel
gaylord
to
find
out
who
stole
the
bonds
and
i
have
done
so
but
the
colonel
did
not
suspect
the
direction
my
investigations
would
take
or
he
never
would
have
engaged
me
now
i
am
wondering
if
it
would
not
be
kinder
not
to
let
him
know
he
had
trouble
enough
with
his
elder
son
radnor
is
all
he
has
left
the
young
man
seems
to
me
like
a
really
decent
fellow
i
dare
say
he
straighten
up
and
amount
to
something
yet
probably
he
considered
the
money
as
practically
his
already
anyway
he
been
decent
to
me
and
i
should
like
to
do
him
a
service
now
say
we
three
talk
it
over
together
and
settle
it
out
of
court
as
it
were
put
in
my
time
down
here
and
i
got
to
have
my
pay
but
perhaps
it
would
be
better
all
around
if
i
took
it
from
the
young
man
rather
than
his
father
this
struck
me
as
the
best
way
out
of
the
muddle
and
a
very
fair
proposition
considering
clancy
point
of
view
i
myself
did
not
for
an
instant
credit
his
suspicions
but
i
thought
the
wisest
thing
to
do
was
to
tell
rad
just
how
the
matter
stood
and
let
him
explain
in
regard
to
the
letter
i
left
clancy
waiting
in
the
summer
house
while
i
went
in
search
of
rad
i
wished
to
be
the
one
to
do
the
explaining
as
i
knew
he
was
not
likely
to
take
any
such
accusation
calmly
i
found
him
in
the
stables
and
putting
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
marched
him
back
toward
the
garden
rad
i
said
clancy
has
formed
his
conclusions
as
to
how
the
bonds
left
the
safe
and
i
want
you
to
convince
him
that
he
is
mistaken
well
let
hear
his
conclusions
he
thinks
that
you
took
them
when
you
took
the
money
you
mean
that
i
stole
them
that
what
he
thinks
he
does
does
he
well
he
can
prove
it
radnor
broke
away
from
me
and
strode
toward
the
summer
house
the
detective
received
his
onslaught
placidly
his
manner
suggested
that
he
was
used
to
dealing
with
excitable
young
men
sit
down
gaylord
and
let
discuss
this
matter
quietly
if
you
listen
to
reason
i
assure
you
it
will
go
no
further
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
accuse
me
of
stealing
those
bonds
radnor
shouted
clancy
held
up
a
warning
hand
do
talk
so
loud
someone
will
hear
you
sit
down
he
nodded
toward
a
seat
on
the
other
side
of
the
little
rustic
table
i
will
explain
the
matter
as
i
see
it
and
if
you
can
disprove
any
of
my
statements
i
shall
be
more
than
glad
to
have
you
radnor
subsided
and
listened
scowlingly
while
the
detective
outlined
his
theory
in
a
perfectly
way
and
ended
by
producing
the
letter
where
did
you
get
that
rad
demanded
out
of
your
coat
pocket
which
i
hooked
over
the
transom
of
the
door
he
made
the
statement
imperturbably
it
was
evidently
a
matter
of
everyday
routine
so
you
enter
gentlemen
houses
as
their
guest
and
spend
your
time
sneaking
about
reading
their
private
correspondence
an
angry
gleam
appeared
in
clancy
eye
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
i
did
not
come
to
your
house
as
your
guest
i
came
on
business
for
colonel
gaylord
now
that
my
business
is
completed
i
will
make
my
report
to
him
and
go
radnor
rose
also
it
a
lie
and
you
have
a
word
of
proof
to
show
clancy
significantly
tapped
the
pocket
that
held
the
letter
that
said
radnor
contemptuously
refers
to
two
bonds
which
i
bought
last
winter
with
some
money
i
got
from
selling
a
mortgage
i
preferred
to
have
the
investment
in
bonds
because
they
are
more
readily
negotiable
i
left
them
at
my
broker
as
collateral
for
another
investment
i
was
making
last
week
i
needed
some
ready
money
and
wrote
to
them
to
sell
my
statement
can
easily
be
substantiated
no
reputable
detective
would
ever
base
any
such
absurd
charge
on
the
contents
of
a
letter
he
did
not
understand
of
course
said
the
detective
we
have
tried
to
get
at
the
matter
from
the
other
end
but
jacoby
haight
company
refuse
to
discuss
the
affairs
of
their
clients
i
did
not
press
the
point
as
i
did
not
want
to
stir
up
comment
however
he
smiled
i
must
confess
gaylord
that
i
think
your
explanation
a
trifle
fishy
perhaps
you
will
answer
one
question
did
you
mail
your
letter
to
them
in
kennisburg
the
night
of
the
robbery
with
a
special
delivery
stamp
it
happens
that
i
did
but
it
was
merely
a
coincidence
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
robbery
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
explain
why
you
drove
to
kennisburg
in
the
night
and
why
you
needed
the
money
so
suddenly
no
i
will
not
that
is
a
matter
which
concerns
me
alone
very
well
as
it
happens
i
do
not
base
my
charge
on
the
letter
i
had
already
formed
my
opinion
before
i
knew
of
its
existence
do
you
deny
that
you
yourself
have
encouraged
the
belief
in
the
ghost
among
the
negroes
that
on
more
than
one
occasion
you
or
your
accomplice
mose
have
masqueraded
as
the
ghost
that
while
you
were
pretending
to
colonel
gaylord
to
be
as
much
puzzled
by
the
matter
as
he
you
were
in
truth
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
business
radnor
glanced
uneasily
at
me
and
hesitated
before
replying
no
he
said
at
length
i
do
deny
that
but
i
do
affirm
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
robbery
the
detective
laughed
you
must
excuse
me
gaylord
if
i
stick
to
the
opinion
that
i
have
solved
the
puzzle
he
turned
with
a
motion
toward
the
house
and
radnor
barred
the
entrance
do
you
think
i
lie
when
i
say
i
know
nothing
of
those
bonds
yes
gaylord
i
do
for
a
moment
i
thought
that
radnor
was
going
to
strike
him
but
i
pulled
him
back
and
turned
to
clancy
he
knows
nothing
about
the
bonds
said
i
but
nevertheless
you
must
not
take
any
such
story
to
colonel
gaylord
he
is
an
old
man
and
while
he
would
not
believe
his
son
guilty
of
theft
still
it
would
worry
him
there
is
something
else
that
happened
that
night
entirely
uncriminal
but
which
we
do
not
wish
him
to
hear
about
therefore
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
go
to
him
with
this
nonsensical
tale
that
you
have
cooked
up
this
was
a
trial
shot
on
my
part
but
it
hit
the
radnor
stared
but
said
nothing
and
the
detective
visibly
wavered
now
i
added
taking
out
my
checkbook
suppose
i
pay
you
what
you
would
have
received
had
you
discovered
the
bonds
and
dispense
with
your
further
services
that
just
as
you
say
i
feel
that
i
done
the
job
and
am
entitled
to
the
money
if
you
wish
to
pay
it
all
right
otherwise
i
get
it
from
colonel
gaylord
i
received
a
retaining
fee
and
was
to
have
two
hundred
dollars
more
when
i
located
the
bonds
in
order
not
to
stir
up
any
bad
feeling
i
willing
to
take
that
two
hundred
dollars
from
you
and
drop
the
matter
it
blackmail
said
radnor
keep
still
rad
i
said
it
very
accommodating
of
clancy
to
see
it
this
way
i
wrote
out
a
check
and
tossed
it
to
the
detective
now
go
to
colonel
gaylord
i
said
tell
him
that
you
have
been
unsuccessful
in
finding
any
clue
that
the
bonds
will
almost
certainly
be
marketed
in
the
city
and
that
your
only
hope
of
tracing
them
is
to
work
from
the
other
end
then
pack
your
bag
and
go
a
carriage
will
be
ready
to
take
you
to
the
junction
in
half
an
hour
just
wait
a
moment
clancy
rad
called
after
him
as
he
turned
away
he
drew
a
note
book
from
his
pocket
and
ripping
out
a
page
scrawled
across
the
face
jacoby
haight
and
you
will
oblige
me
by
answering
any
questions
which
the
bearer
of
this
note
may
ask
concerning
my
past
transactions
with
you
radnor
f
gaylord
there
said
rad
thrusting
it
toward
him
kindly
make
use
of
that
when
you
get
to
washington
and
in
the
future
i
should
advise
you
to
base
your
charges
on
something
a
little
more
substantial
his
manner
was
insultingly
contemptuous
but
clancy
swallowed
it
with
smiling
good
nature
i
shall
be
interested
in
continuing
the
investigation
he
observed
as
he
pocketed
the
paper
and
withdrew
chapter
viii
the
robbery
remains
a
mystery
so
we
got
rid
of
the
detective
but
matters
did
not
readily
settle
down
again
into
their
old
relations
the
colonel
was
irritable
and
rad
was
moody
and
sullen
he
showed
no
tendency
to
confide
in
me
as
to
the
truth
about
the
and
i
did
not
probe
the
matter
further
in
a
day
or
so
he
brought
me
three
hundred
dollars
to
cover
the
amount
i
had
loaned
him
together
with
the
blackmail
as
he
insisted
upon
calling
it
the
money
he
informed
me
was
from
the
proceeds
of
the
bonds
he
had
sold
he
showed
me
at
the
same
time
several
letters
from
his
brokers
establishing
beyond
a
doubt
that
the
story
he
had
told
was
true
as
to
the
stolen
bonds
their
whereabouts
was
as
much
a
mystery
as
ever
and
rad
appeared
to
take
not
the
slightest
interest
in
the
matter
since
the
detective
had
been
summoned
he
had
washed
his
hands
of
all
responsibility
i
think
it
was
the
morning
after
clancy
departure
that
solomon
handed
me
a
pale
blue
envelope
bearing
in
the
upper
corner
the
device
of
the
i
laughed
as
i
ripped
it
open
i
had
almost
forgotten

it
contained

not

you
want
me

find
them

ended
with
the
remark
that
the
mystery
was
as
yet
unsolved
but
that
the
best
detective
talent
in
the
country
had
been
engaged
on
the
case
i
tossed
the
letter
to
radnor
with
a
laugh
he
had
already
heard
of
terry
connection
with
the
affair
perhaps
we
could
do
better
than
to
get
him
down
i
suggested
most
abnormally
keen
at
ferreting
out
a
mystery
that
promises
any
news
if
any
one
can
learn
the
truth
about
those
bonds
he
can
i
do
want
to
know
the
truth
radnor
growled
i
sick
of
the
very
name
of
bonds
and
this
had
been
his
attitude
from
the
moment
the
detective
left
my
own
insistence
that
it
was
our
duty
to
track
down
the
thief
met
with
nothing
but
a
shrug
another
person
might
have
suspected
that
this
apathy
only
proved
his
own
culpability
in
the
theft
but
such
a
suspicion
never
for
a
moment
crossed
my
mind
he
was
as
he
said
sick
of
the
very
name
of
bonds
and
with
a
person
of
his
temperament
that
ended
the
matter
though
i
did
not
comprehend
his
attitude
still
i
took
him
at
his
word
there
was
something
about
rad
straightforward
way
of
looking
one
in
the
eye
that
impelled
belief
as
i
had
heard
the
colonel
boast
a
gaylord
could
not
tell
a
lie
the
things
a
gaylord
could
and
could
not
do
were
i
acknowledge
to
a
northern
ethical
sense
a
trifle
mystifying
a
gaylord
might
drink
and
gamble
and
fail
to
pay
his
debts
not
his
gambling
debts
his
tailor
and
his
grocer
he
might
be
the
hero
of
many
doubtful
affairs
with
women
he
might
in
a
sudden
fit
of
passion
commit
a
murder
there
was
more
than
one
killing
in
the
family
annals
but
under
no
circumstances
would
his
honah
permit
him
to
tell
a
lie
the
reservation
struck
me
somewhat
humorously
as
an
but
nevertheless
i
believed
it
when
rad
said
he
knew
nothing
of
the
stolen
bonds
i
dismissed
the
possibility
from
my
mind
though
i
was
relieved
to
feel
that
he
was
not
guilty
still
i
was
worried
and
nervous
over
the
matter
i
felt
that
it
was
criminal
not
to
do
something
and
yet
my
hands
were
tied
i
could
scarcely
undertake
an
investigation
myself
for
every
clue
led
across
the
trail
of
the
and
that
rad
made
it
clear
was
forbidden
ground
the
colonel
meanwhile
was
comparatively
quiet
as
he
supposed
the
detective
was
still
working
on
the
case
i
accordingly
did
nothing
but
i
kept
my
eyes
open
hoping
that
something
would
turn
up
rad
temper
was
absolutely
unbearable
for
the
first
week
after
the
detective
left
the
reason
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
stolen
bonds
but
was
concerned
entirely
with
polly
mathers
behavior
she
barely
noticed
rad
existence
so
occupied
was
she
with
the
ecstatic
young
sheriff
what
the
trouble
was
i
did
not
know
but
i
suspected
that
it
was
the
whispered
conjectures
in
regard
to
the
i
remember
one
evening
in
particular
that
she
snubbed
him
in
the
face
of
the
entire
neighborhood
we
had
arrived
at
a
party
a
trifle
late
to
find
polly
as
usual
the
center
of
a
laughing
group
of
young
men
all
clamoring
for
dances
they
widened
their
circle
to
admit
rad
in
a
way
which
tacitly
acknowledged
his
prior
claim
he
inquired
with
his
most
deferential
bow
what
dances
she
had
saved
for
him
polly
replied
in
an
manner
that
she
was
sorry
but
her
card
was
already
full
rad
shrugged
nonchalantly
and
sauntering
toward
the
door
disappeared
for
the
rest
of
the
night
when
he
turned
up
at
early
in
the
morning
his
horse
uncle
jake
informed
me
looked
as
if
it
had
been
ridden
by
de
debbil
hisself
with
radnor
in
this
state
and
the
colonel
growing
daily
more
irritable
over
the
continued
mystery
of
the
bonds
it
is
not
strange
that
matters
between
them
were
at
a
high
state
of
tension
as
i
saw
more
of
the
colonel
treatment
of
rad
i
came
to
realize
that
there
was
considerable
excuse
for
jefferson
wildness
while
he
was
a
kind
man
at
heart
still
he
had
an
ungovernable
temper
and
an
absolutely
tyrannical
desire
to
rule
every
one
about
him
his
was
the
only
free
will
allowed
on
the
place
he
attempted
to
treat
rad
at
much
as
he
had
done
at
twelve
a
few
months
before
my
arrival
i
heard
this
later
he
had
even
struck
him
whereupon
radnor
had
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
out
of
the
house
and
had
only
consented
to
come
back
two
weeks
later
when
he
heard
that
the
old
man
was
ill
if
two
men
ever
needed
a
woman
to
manage
them
these
were
the
two
i
think
that
if
my
aunt
had
lived
most
of
the
trouble
would
have
been
avoided
rad
was
not
the
only
one
however
who
felt
the
colonel
irritation
over
the
robbery
his
treatment
of
the
servants
was
harsh
and
even
cruel
everybody
on
the
place
went
about
in
a
fashion
he
treated
mose
like
a
dog
why
the
fellow
stood
it
i
do
know
the
colonel
seemed
never
to
have
learned
that
the
old
slave
days
were
over
and
that
he
no
longer
owned
the
negroes
body
and
soul
his
government
of
the
plantation
was
in
the
manner
of
a
despot
everybody
from
his
own
son
to
the
merest
pickaninny
was
at
the
mercy
of
his
caprice
when
he
was
in
good
humor
he
was
kindness
itself
to
the
darkies
when
he
was
in
bad
humor
he
vented
his
anger
on
whoever
happened
to
be
nearest
i
shall
never
forget
the
feeling
of
indignation
with
which
i
first
saw
him
strike
a
man
a
strange
negro
was
caught
one
morning
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
chicken
coop
and
was
brought
up
to
the
house
by
two
of
the
my
uncle
who
was
standing
on
the
portico
steps
waiting
for
his
horse
was
in
a
particularly
savage
mood
as
he
had
just
come
from
an
altercation
with
radnor
the
man
said
that
he
was
hungry
and
asked
for
work
but
the
colonel
almost
without
waiting
to
hear
him
speak
fell
upon
him
in
a
fit
of
blind
rage
slashing
him
half
a
dozen
times
over
the
head
and
shoulders
with
his
heavy
riding
crop
the
negro
who
was
a
powerfully
built
fellow
instead
of
standing
up
and
defending
himself
like
a
man
crouched
on
the
ground
with
his
arms
over
his
head
please
cunnel
gaylord
he
whimpered
le
me
go
i
ai
done
nuffen
i
ai
steal
no
chickens
for
gord
sake
doan
whip
me
i
sprang
forward
with
an
angry
exclamation
and
grasped
my
uncle
arm
the
fellow
was
on
his
feet
instantly
and
off
down
the
lane
without
once
glancing
back
the
colonel
stood
a
moment
looking
from
my
indignant
face
to
the
man
disappearing
in
the
distance
and
burst
out
laughing
i
reckon
i
wo
be
troubled
with
any
more
he
remarked
as
he
mounted
and
rode
away
his
good
humor
apparently
quite
restored
i
confess
that
it
took
me
some
time
to
get
over
that
scene
but
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
treated
his
own
servants
in
the
same
summary
fashion
the
thing
that
puzzled
me
most
was
the
way
in
which
they
received
it
mose
being
always
at
hand
was
cuffed
about
more
than
any
negro
on
the
place
but
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
it
only
seemed
to
increase
his
love
and
veneration
for
the
colonel
i
do
believe
the
situation
could
ever
be
intelligible
to
a
northern
man
so
matters
stood
when
i
had
been
a
month
at
my
vacation
had
lasted
long
enough
but
i
was
supremely
comfortable
and
very
loath
to
go
the
first
few
weeks
of
may
had
been
to
my
starved
city
eyes
a
dazzling
pageant
of
beauty
the
landscape
glowed
with
yellow
daffodils
pink
peach
blossoms
and
the
bright
green
of
new
wheat
the
fields
were
alive
with
the
frisky
joyousness
of
spring
lambs
and
colts
turned
out
to
pasture
it
was
with
a
keen
feeling
of
reluctance
that
i
faced
the
prospect
of
new
york
brick
and
stone
and
asphalt
my
work
was
calling
but
i
lazily
postponed
my
departure
from
day
to
day
things
at
the
plantation
seemed
to
have
settled
into
their
old
routine
the
whereabouts
of
the
bonds
was
still
a
mystery
but
the
had
returned
to
his
grave
at
least
in
so
far
as
any
manifestations
affected
the
house
i
believe
that
the
sperrit
of
de
had
been
seen
rising
once
or
twice
from
a
cloud
of
sulphurous
smoke
but
the
excitement
was
confined
strictly
to
the
negro
quarters
no
man
on
the
place
who
valued
a
whole
skin
would
have
dared
mention
the
word
in
colonel
gaylord
presence
relations
between
rad
and
his
father
were
rather
less
strained
and
matters
on
the
whole
were
going
pleasantly
enough
when
there
suddenly
fell
from
a
clear
sky
the
strange
and
terrible
series
of
events
which
changed
everything
at
chapter
ix
the
expedition
to
luray
toward
eleven
one
morning
the
colonel
radnor
and
i
were
established
in
lounging
chairs
in
the
shade
of
a
big
catalpa
tree
on
the
lawn
it
was
a
warm
day
and
rad
and
i
were
just
back
from
a
tramp
to
the
upper
pasture
a
full
mile
from
the
house
we
were
addressing
ourselves
with
considerable
zest
to
the
frosted
glasses
that
solomon
had
just
placed
on
the
table
when
we
became
aware
of
the
sound
of
galloping
hoofs
and
a
moment
later
polly
mathers
and
her
sorrel
mare
tiger
lilly
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
sunflecked
lane
an
irish
setter
romped
at
her
side
and
the
three
of
them
made
a
picture
the
shining
coat
the
dog
silky
hair
and
polly
own
red
gold
curls
were
almost
of
a
color
i
believe
the
little
witch
had
chosen
the
two
on
purpose
in
her
dark
habit
and
mannish
hat
with
sparkling
cheeks
and
laughing
eyes
she
was
as
pretty
an
apparition
as
ever
enhanced
a
may
morning
she
waved
her
crop
gaily
and
rode
toward
us
across
the
lawn
howdy
she
called
in
a
droll
imitation
of
the
mountain
dialect
ai
guine
to
ask
me
to
a
while
an
set
a
bit
talk
a
spell
radnor
face
had
flushed
quickly
as
he
perceived
who
the
rider
was
but
he
held
himself
stiffly
in
the
background
while
the
colonel
and
i
did
the
honors
it
was
the
first
time
i
know
that
polly
and
rad
had
met
since
the
night
she
refused
to
dance
with
him
and
her
appearance
could
only
be
interpreted
as
a
desire
to
make
amends
she
sprang
lightly
to
the
ground
turned
tiger
lilly
loose
to
graze
about
the
lawn
and
airily
perched
herself
on
the
arm
of
a
chair
there
was
nothing
in
her
manner
at
least
to
suggest
that
her
relations
with
any
one
of
us
were
strained
after
a
few
moments
of
neighborly
gossip
with
the
colonel
and
me
rad
was
monosyllabic
and
remote
she
arrived
at
her
errand
some
friends
from
savannah
were
stopping
at
the
hall
on
their
way
to
the
virginia
hot
springs
and
as
is
usual
when
strangers
visit
the
valley
they
were
planning
an
expedition
to
luray
cave
the
cave
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
about
ten
miles
from
since
i
had
not
yet
visited
it
that
was
at
least
the
reason
she
gave
she
had
come
to
ask
the
three
of
us
to
join
the
party
on
the
following
day
rad
was
sulky
at
first
and
rather
curtly
declined
on
the
ground
that
he
had
to
attend
to
some
business
but
polly
scouted
his
excuse
and
added
significantly
that
jim
mattison
had
not
been
asked
he
accepted
this
mark
of
repentance
with
a
pleased
flush
and
before
she
rode
away
he
had
become
his
former
cheerful
self
again
the
colonel
also
demurred
on
the
ground
that
he
was
getting
too
old
for
such
diversions
but
polly
laid
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
and
coaxed
him
into
acquiescence
even
a
mummy
must
have
unbent
before
such
persuasion
as
a
matter
of
fact
though
the
colonel
was
only
too
pleased
with
his
invitation
it
flattered
him
to
be
included
with
the
young
people
and
he
was
immensely
fond
of
polly
it
struck
me
suddenly
as
i
watched
her
how
like
she
was
to
that
other
girl
of
eighteen
years
before
there
danced
in
polly
eyes
the
same
eager
joy
of
life
that
vitalized
the
face
of
the
portrait
over
the
mantelpiece
upstairs
the
resemblance
for
a
moment
was
almost
startling
i
believe
the
same
thought
had
come
to
colonel
gaylord
the
old
eyes
dwelt
upon
her
with
a
sadly
wistful
air
and
i
like
to
feel
that
it
was
of
nannie
he
was
thinking
radnor
and
i
had
been
invited
to
a
dance
that
same
evening
at
a
neighboring
country
house
but
when
the
time
came
i
begged
off
on
the
plea
of
wishing
to
rest
for
the
ride
the
next
morning
the
real
reason
i
fancy
was
that
i
too
was
suffering
from
a
touch
of
radnor
trouble
and
since
i
had
no
chance
of
winning
her
it
was
the
part
of
wisdom
to
keep
out
of
hearing
of
polly
laugh
in
any
case
i
went
to
bed
and
to
sleep
while
rad
went
to
the
party
and
i
have
never
known
exactly
what
happened
that
night
i
rose
early
the
next
morning
and
as
i
went
down
stairs
i
saw
solomon
crawling
around
on
his
hands
and
knees
on
the
parlor
floor
collecting
the
remnants
of
a
french
clock
which
had
stood
on
the
mantelpiece
how
did
that
clock
come
to
be
broken
i
asked
a
trifle
sharply
thinking
i
had
caught
him
in
a
bad
piece
of
carelessness
cay
say
sah
solomon
returned
rising
on
his
knees
and
looking
at
me
mournfully
i
specs
ole
marsa
been
chastisin
young
marsa
again
it
destructive
on
de
i
went
on
out
of
doors
wondering
sadly
if
radnor
could
have
been
drinking
and
accusing
myself
for
not
having
gone
to
the
party
and
kept
him
straight
it
was
evident
at
breakfast
that
something
serious
had
happened
between
him
and
his
father
the
colonel
appeared
unusually
grave
and
rad
after
a
gruff
good
morning
sat
staring
at
his
plate
in
a
dogged
silence
throughout
the
meal
he
scarcely
so
much
as
exchanged
a
glance
with
his
father
i
tried
to
talk
as
if
i
noticed
nothing
and
in
the
course
of
the
somewhat
conversation
happened
to
mention
our
proposed
trip
to
luray
rad
returned
that
he
had
visited
the
cave
a
good
many
times
and
did
not
care
about
going
i
was
puzzled
at
this
for
i
knew
that
the
cave
was
not
the
chief
attraction
but
i
discreetly
dropped
the
subject
and
shortly
after
we
rose
from
the
table
as
i
left
the
room
i
saw
the
colonel
walk
over
and
lay
his
hand
on
radnor
arm
you
will
change
your
mind
and
go
my
boy
he
said
but
rad
shook
the
hand
off
roughly
and
turned
away
as
i
went
on
out
to
the
stables
to
give
orders
about
the
horses
i
felt
in
anything
but
the
proper
spirits
for
a
day
of
however
much
the
colonel
may
have
been
to
blame
in
their
quarrel
of
the
night
before
and
the
french
clock
told
its
own
story
still
i
could
not
help
but
feel
that
rad
should
have
borne
with
him
more
patiently
the
scene
i
had
just
witnessed
in
the
made
me
miserable
the
colonel
was
a
proud
man
and
apology
came
hard
for
him
his
son
might
at
least
have
met
him
half
way
going
upstairs
to
my
room
a
few
minutes
later
i
caught
a
glimpse
through
the
open
door
of
someone
standing
before
the
mantelpiece
thinking
it
was
radnor
waiting
to
consult
me
i
hurried
forward
and
reached
the
threshold
before
i
realized
that
it
was
the
colonel
he
was
standing
with
folded
arms
before
the
picture
his
eyes
gleaming
from
under
beetling
brows
were
devouring
it
hungrily
line
by
line
his
face
was
set
rigidly
with
a
look
whether
of
sorrow
or
loneliness
or
remorse
i
do
not
know
but
i
do
know
that
it
was
the
saddest
expression
i
have
ever
seen
on
any
human
face
it
was
as
if
in
a
single
illuminating
flash
he
had
looked
into
his
own
soul
and
seen
the
ruin
that
his
ungoverned
pride
and
passion
had
wrought
against
those
he
loved
the
most
so
absorbed
had
he
been
with
his
thoughts
that
he
had
not
heard
my
step
i
turned
and
stole
away
realizing
suddenly
that
he
was
an
old
man
broken
infirm
that
his
life
with
its
influence
for
good
or
evil
was
already
at
an
end
he
could
never
change
his
character
now
no
matter
how
keenly
he
might
realize
his
defects
poor
little
wilfulness
was
at
last
forgiven
but
the
forgiveness
was
fifteen
years
too
late
why
could
not
that
moment
of
insight
have
come
earlier
to
colonel
gaylord
have
come
in
time
to
save
him
from
his
mistakes
i
passed
out
of
doors
again
pondering
somewhat
bitterly
the
exigencies
of
human
life
the
bright
spring
morning
with
its
promise
of
youth
and
joy
seemed
jarringly
out
of
tune
the
beauty
was
but
surface
deep
i
told
myself
pessimistically
underneath
it
was
a
cruel
world
before
me
in
the
garden
path
a
jubilant
robin
was
pulling
an
unhappy
angle
worm
from
the
ground
and
a
little
farther
on
under
a
blossoming
apple
tree
the
kitchen
cat
was
breakfasting
on
a
baby
robin
the
double
spectacle
struck
me
as
significant
of
life
i
was
casting
about
for
some
philosophical
truths
to
fit
it
when
my
revery
was
interrupted
by
a
shout
from
radnor
i
turned
to
find
the
horses
three
of
them
waiting
at
the
portico
steps
rad
was
going
then
after
all
he
and
his
father
had
evidently
patched
up
some
sort
of
a
truce
but
i
soon
saw
that
it
was
only
a
truce
the
two
avoided
crossing
eyes
and
as
we
rode
along
they
talked
to
me
instead
of
to
each
other
the
party
met
at
mathers
hall
the
plan
was
for
us
to
ride
to
luray
that
morning
spend
most
of
the
afternoon
there
and
then
return
to
the
hall
for
a
supper
and
dance
in
the
evening
the
elder
ladies
took
the
carriage
while
the
rest
of
us
went
on
horseback
a
couple
of
servants
following
in
the
buckboard
with
the
luncheon
mose
and
all
was
brought
along
to
act
as
guide
and
he
was
fairly
purring
with
contentment
at
the
importance
it
gave
him
over
the
other
negroes
it
seems
that
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
finding
his
way
around
in
the
cave
ever
since
he
was
a
little
shaver
and
he
knew
the
route
radnor
told
me
better
than
the
professional
guides
he
knew
it
so
well
in
fact
that
the
entire
neighborhood
was
in
the
habit
of
borrowing
him
whenever
expeditions
were
being
planned
to
luray
we
left
our
horses
at
the
village
hotel
and
after
eating
a
picnic
lunch
in
the
woods
set
out
to
make
the
usual
round
of
the
cave
luray
has
since
been
lighted
with
electricity
and
laid
out
in
cement
walks
but
the
time
of
which
i
am
writing
was
before
its
exploitation
by
the
railroad
and
the
cavern
was
still
in
its
natural
state
each
of
us
carried
either
candles
or
a
torch
and
the
guides
were
supplied
with
calcium
lights
which
they
touched
off
at
intervals
whenever
there
was
any
special
object
of
interest
this
was
the
first
cavern
of
any
size
that
i
had
ever
visited
and
i
was
so
taken
up
with
examining
the
rock
formations
and
keeping
my
torch
from
burning
my
hands
that
i
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
the
disposal
of
the
rest
of
the
party
it
took
over
two
hours
to
make
the
round
and
we
must
have
walked
about
five
miles
what
with
the
heavy
damp
air
and
the
slippery
path
i
for
one
was
glad
to
get
out
into
the
sunshine
again
i
joined
the
group
about
polly
mathers
and
casually
asked
if
she
knew
where
radnor
had
gone
i
have
seen
him
for
some
time
i
think
he
must
have
come
out
before
us
she
replied
and
unless
i
am
mistaken
colonel
gaylord
she
added
turning
to
my
uncle
he
left
my
coat
on
that
broken
column
above
crystal
lake
i
am
afraid
that
he
is
a
very
good
cavalier
the
colonel
i
imagine
had
been
a
very
good
cavalier
in
his
own
youth
and
i
do
not
think
that
he
had
entirely
outgrown
it
i
will
repair
his
fault
miss
polly
the
old
man
returned
with
a
courtly
bow
and
prove
to
you
that
the
boy
does
not
take
after
his
father
in
lack
of
gallantry
no
indeed
colonel
gaylord
polly
exclaimed
i
was
only
joking
i
should
think
of
letting
you
go
back
after
it
one
of
the
servants
can
get
it
i
shortly
after
ran
across
mose
and
sent
him
back
for
the
coat
and
the
incident
was
forgotten
we
straggled
back
to
the
hotel
in
twos
and
threes
the
horses
were
brought
out
and
we
got
off
amidst
general
confusion
i
rode
beside
the
carriage
for
a
couple
of
miles
exchanging
courtesies
with
mathers
and
then
galloped
ahead
to
join
the
other
riders
i
was
surprised
to
see
neither
my
uncle
nor
radnor
anywhere
in
sight
and
inquired
as
to
their
whereabouts
i
thought
they
were
riding
with
you
said
polly
wheeling
to
my
side
you
do
suppose
she
asked
quickly
that
the
colonel
was
foolish
enough
to
go
back
for
my
coat
and
we
left
him
behind
one
of
the
men
laughed
he
has
a
horse
miss
polly
and
he
knows
how
to
use
it
i
dare
say
even
if
we
did
leave
him
behind
that
he
can
find
his
way
home
i
sent
mose
back
for
the
coat
i
remarked
the
colonel
probably
feels
that
he
has
had
enough
frivolity
for
one
day
and
has
preferred
to
ride
straight
on
to
it
occurred
to
me
that
rad
and
his
father
had
ridden
home
together
to
make
up
their
quarrel
and
the
reflection
added
considerably
to
my
peace
of
mind
i
had
felt
vaguely
uncomfortable
over
the
matter
all
day
for
i
knew
that
the
old
man
was
always
miserable
after
a
misunderstanding
with
his
son
and
i
strongly
suspected
that
radnor
himself
was
far
from
happy
when
we
arrived
at
mathers
hall
polly
slipped
from
her
saddle
and
came
running
up
to
me
as
i
was
about
to
dismount
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
bridle
and
asked
in
the
sweetest
way
possible
if
i
would
mind
riding
back
to
the
plantation
to
see
if
the
colonel
were
really
there
as
she
could
not
help
feeling
anxious
about
him
i
noticed
with
a
smile
that
she
made
no
comment
on
the
younger
man
defection
though
i
strongly
suspected
that
she
was
no
less
interested
in
that
i
turned
about
and
galloped
off
again
willing
enough
to
do
her
bidding
though
i
could
not
help
reflecting
that
it
would
have
been
just
as
easy
for
her
and
considerably
easier
for
me
had
she
developed
her
anxiety
a
few
miles
back
when
i
reached
the
four
corners
where
the
road
to
branches
off
from
the
valley
turnpike
i
saw
the
wagon
coming
with
the
two
mathers
negroes
in
it
but
without
any
sign
of
mose
i
drew
up
and
waited
for
them
hello
boys
i
called
what
become
of
mose
dat
moh
i
can
say
mista
ahnold
one
of
the
men
returned
we
waited
foh
him
a
while
but
it
like
he
i
reckon
he
took
to
de
woods
an
is
gwine
to
walk
home
dat
mose
he
monstrous
fond
ob
walkin
i
do
not
know
why
this
incident
should
have
aroused
my
own
anxiety
but
i
pushed
on
to
the
plantation
with
a
growing
feeling
of
uneasiness
nothing
had
been
seen
of
either
the
colonel
or
mose
solomon
informed
me
but
he
added
with
an
excited
rolling
of
his
eyes
marse
rad
he
come
back
nearly
an
hour
ago
an
stomp
roun
like
he
crazy
an
den
went
out
to
de
gahden
i
followed
him
and
found
him
sitting
in
the
summer
house
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
head
in
his
hands
what
the
matter
rad
i
cried
in
alarm
has
anything
happened
to
your
father
he
looked
up
with
a
start
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
and
i
saw
that
his
face
was
pale
my
father
he
asked
in
a
dazed
way
i
left
him
in
the
cave
why
do
you
ask
he
did
come
back
with
the
rest
of
us
and
polly
asked
me
to
find
him
he
old
enough
to
take
care
of
himself
said
radnor
without
looking
up
i
hesitated
a
moment
uncertain
what
to
do
and
then
turned
back
to
the
stables
to
order
a
fresh
horse
to
my
astonishment
i
found
the
gathered
in
a
group
about
rad
mare
jennie
loo
she
was
dashed
with
foam
and
trembling
and
appeared
to
be
about
used
up
the
men
fell
back
and
eyed
me
silently
as
i
approached
what
happened
to
the
horse
i
cried
did
she
run
away
one
of
the
men
reckoned
that
marse
rad
had
been
whipping
her
whipping
her
i
exclaimed
in
dismay
it
was
unbelievable
for
no
one
as
a
rule
was
kinder
to
animals
than
radnor
and
as
for
his
own
jennie
loo
he
could
have
cared
more
for
her
if
she
had
been
a
human
being
there
was
no
mistaking
it
however
she
was
crossed
and
recrossed
with
thick
welts
about
the
withers
it
was
evident
that
the
poor
beast
had
been
disgracefully
handled
uncle
jake
volunteered
that
rad
had
galloped
straight
into
the
stable
had
dropped
the
bridle
and
walked
off
without
a
word
and
he
added
the
opinion
that
a
debbil
had
done
conjured
him
i
was
inclined
to
agree
there
seemed
to
be
something
in
the
air
that
i
did
not
understand
and
my
anxiety
for
the
colonel
suddenly
rushed
back
fourfold
i
wheeled
about
and
ordered
a
horse
in
an
unnecessarily
sharp
tone
and
the
men
jumped
to
obey
me
it
was
just
sunset
as
i
mounted
again
and
galloped
down
the
lane
for
the
second
time
that
day
i
set
out
along
the
lonely
mountain
road
leading
to
luray
but
this
time
with
a
vague
fear
gripping
at
my
heart
why
had
radnor
acted
so
strangely
i
asked
myself
again
and
again
could
it
be
connected
with
last
night
quarrel
and
where
was
the
colonel
and
where
was
mose
chapter
x
the
tragedy
of
the
cave
it
was
almost
dark
by
the
time
i
reached
the
village
of
luray
i
galloped
up
to
the
hotel
where
we
had
left
our
horses
that
morning
and
without
dismounting
called
out
to
the
loafers
on
the
veranda
to
ask
if
anyone
had
seen
colonel
gaylord
two
or
three
of
them
glad
of
a
diversion
got
up
and
sauntered
out
to
the
where
i
waited
to
discuss
the
situation
what
was
the
matter
they
inquired
had
the
colonel
gone
home
with
the
rest
of
the
party
no
he
had
not
i
returned
impatiently
and
i
wanted
to
know
if
any
of
them
had
seen
him
they
consulted
together
and
finally
decided
that
no
one
had
seen
him
and
at
this
the
stable
boy
vouchsafed
the
information
that
red
pepper
was
still
in
the
barn
i
thought
maybe
the
colonel
was
intending
to
make
me
a
present
of
that
horse
the
landlord
observed
with
a
grin
as
he
joined
the
group
a
chuckle
ran
around
the
circle
at
this
sally
it
was
evident
that
the
colonel
did
not
have
a
reputation
in
the
county
for
making
presents
i
impatiently
gathered
up
my
reins
and
one
of
the
men
remarked
i
reckon
young
gaylord
got
home
in
good
time
he
was
in
an
almighty
hurry
when
he
started
he
did
stop
for
no
farewells
with
numerous
interruptions
and
humorous
interpolations
they
finally
managed
to
tell
me
in
their
exasperatingly
slow
drawl
that
rad
had
come
back
to
the
hotel
that
afternoon
before
the
rest
of
the
party
had
drunk
two
glasses
of
brandy
called
for
his
horse
and
galloped
off
without
speaking
a
word
to
anyone
except
to
swear
at
the
stable
boy
the
speaker
finished
with
the
assertion
that
in
his
opinion
rad
gaylord
and
jeff
gaylord
were
cut
out
of
the
same
block
i
shifted
my
seat
uneasily
this
information
did
not
tend
to
throw
any
light
on
the
question
of
the
colonel
whereabouts
and
i
was
in
no
mood
just
then
to
listen
to
any
more
gossip
about
rad
i
not
looking
for
young
gaylord
i
said
shortly
i
know
where
he
is
it
the
colonel
i
after
neither
he
nor
mose
have
come
back
and
i
afraid
they
lost
in
the
cave
the
men
laughed
at
this
people
did
get
lost
in
the
cave
they
said
all
anyone
had
to
do
was
to
follow
the
path
and
besides
if
the
colonel
was
with
mose
he
could
get
lost
if
he
tried
mose
knew
the
cave
so
well
that
he
could
find
his
way
around
it
in
the
dark
colonel
gaylord
had
probably
met
some
friends
in
the
village
and
driven
home
with
them
but
i
would
not
be
satisfied
with
an
explanation
of
that
sort
the
colonel
i
knew
was
not
in
the
habit
of
abandoning
horses
in
any
such
casual
manner
and
even
supposing
he
had
gone
home
with
some
friends
he
would
scarcely
have
taken
mose
along
i
dismounted
turned
my
horse
over
to
the
stable
boy
and
announced
that
the
cave
must
be
searched
this
request
was
received
with
some
amusement
the
idea
of
getting
out
a
search
party
for
mose
struck
them
as
peculiarly
ludicrous
but
i
insisted
and
finally
one
of
the
men
who
was
in
the
habit
of
acting
as
guide
took
his
feet
down
from
the
veranda
railing
with
a
grunt
of
disapproval
and
shambled
into
the
house
after
some
candles
and
a
lantern
two
or
three
of
the
others
joined
the
expedition
after
a
good
deal
of
chaffing
at
my
expense
we
set
out
for
the
mouth
of
the
cave
by
a
short
cut
that
led
across
the
fields
it
was
quite
dark
by
this
time
and
as
there
was
no
moon
our
one
lantern
did
not
go
far
toward
lighting
the
path
we
stumbled
along
over
plowed
ground
and
through
swampy
pastures
to
the
music
of
croaking
frogs
and
at
first
the
way
was
enlivened
by
humorous
suggestions
on
the
part
of
my
companions
as
to
what
had
become
of
colonel
gaylord
but
as
i
did
not
respond
very
freely
to
their
bantering
they
finally
fell
silent
with
only
an
occasional
imprecation
as
someone
stubbed
his
toe
or
caught
his
clothing
on
a
brier
after
a
half
hour
or
so
of
plodding
we
came
to
a
clear
path
through
the
woods
and
in
a
few
minutes
reached
the
mouth
of
the
cave
a
rough
little
shanty
was
built
over
the
entrance
it
was
closed
by
a
ramshackle
door
which
a
child
could
have
opened
without
any
difficulty
there
was
at
least
no
danger
of
the
colonel
having
been
locked
inside
lighting
our
candles
we
descended
the
rough
stone
staircase
into
the
first
great
vault
which
forms
a
sort
of
vestibule
to
the
caverns
with
our
hands
to
our
mouths
we
hallooed
several
times
and
then
held
our
breath
while
we
waited
for
an
answer
the
only
sound
which
came
out
of
the
stillness
was
the
occasional
drip
of
water
or
the
flap
of
a
wing
had
the
colonel
been
lost
in
any
of
the
winding
passages
he
must
have
heard
us
and
replied
for
the
slightest
sound
is
audible
in
such
a
cavern
echoing
and
as
it
does
through
countless
vaulted
galleries
the
silence
however
instead
of
assuring
me
that
he
was
not
there
only
increased
my
uneasiness
what
if
he
had
slipped
on
the
wet
clay
and
having
injured
himself
was
lying
unconscious
in
the
darkness
the
men
wished
to
turn
back
but
i
insisted
that
we
go
as
far
as
the
broken
column
which
lies
in
a
little
gallery
above
crystal
lake
that
was
the
place
where
the
coat
had
been
left
and
we
could
at
least
find
out
if
either
the
colonel
or
mose
had
returned
for
it
we
set
out
in
single
file
along
the
damp
clay
path
the
light
from
our
few
candles
only
serving
to
intensify
the
blackness
around
us
the
huge
white
forms
of
the
stalactites
seemed
to
follow
us
like
ghosts
in
the
gloom
every
now
and
then
a
bat
flapped
past
our
faces
and
i
wondered
with
a
shiver
how
anyone
could
get
up
courage
to
go
alone
into
such
a
hole
as
that
crystal
lake
is
a
shallow
pool
lying
in
a
sort
of
bowl
on
the
farther
side
the
path
runs
up
seven
or
eight
feet
above
the
water
along
the
broken
edge
of
a
cliff
a
few
steps
beyond
the
pool
the
path
diverges
sharply
to
the
left
and
opens
into
the
little
gallery
of
the
broken
column
just
as
we
were
about
to
ascend
the
two
or
three
stone
steps
leading
to
the
incline
the
guide
in
front
stopped
short
and
clutching
me
by
the
arm
pointed
a
shaking
forefinger
toward
the
pool
what
that
he
gasped
i
strained
my
eyes
into
the
darkness
but
i
could
see
nothing
there
that
black
thing
under
the
bank
he
said
raising
his
candle
and
throwing
the
light
over
the
water
we
all
saw
it
now
and
recognized
it
with
a
thrill
of
horror
it
was
the
body
of
colonel
gaylord
he
was
lying
on
his
face
at
the
bottom
of
the
pool
and
with
outstretched
arms
was
clutching
the
mud
in
his
hands
the
still
water
above
him
was
as
clear
as
crystal
but
was
tinged
with
red
it
my
uncle
i
cried
springing
forward
he
fallen
over
the
bank
he
may
not
be
dead
but
they
held
me
back
he
as
dead
as
he
ever
will
be
the
guide
said
grimly
an
more
colonel
gaylord
war
the
man
to
drown
in
three
foot
o
water
without
making
a
struggle
this
ai
no
accident
it
murder
we
must
go
back
an
get
the
coroner
it
agen
the
law
to
touch
the
body
until
he
comes
it
went
to
my
heart
to
leave
the
old
man
lying
there
at
the
bottom
of
that
pool
but
i
could
not
prevail
on
one
of
them
to
help
me
move
him
the
coroner
must
be
brought
they
stubbornly
insisted
and
they
restrained
me
forcibly
when
i
would
have
waded
into
the
water
we
turned
back
with
shaking
knees
and
hurried
toward
the
mouth
of
the
cave
slipping
and
sliding
in
the
wet
clay
as
we
ran
i
for
one
felt
as
though
a
dozen
assassins
were
following
our
footsteps
in
the
dark
and
all
the
time
i
had
a
sickening
feeling
that
my
uncle
death
only
foreshadowed
a
more
terrible
tragedy
the
guide
this
ai
no
accident
it
murder
kept
running
in
my
head
and
much
as
i
tried
to
drive
the
thought
from
me
a
horrible
suspicion
came
creeping
to
my
mind
that
i
knew
who
the
murderer
must
be
chapter
xi
the
sheriff
visits
we
found
the
coroner
and
told
our
story
he
sent
word
to
kennisburg
the
for
the
sheriff
to
come
and
then
having
called
a
doctor
and
three
or
four
other
witnesses
we
set
out
again
for
the
cave
the
news
of
the
tragedy
had
spread
like
and
half
the
town
of
luray
would
have
accompanied
us
had
the
coroner
not
forcibly
prevented
it
he
stationed
two
men
at
the
entrance
of
the
cave
to
keep
the
crowd
from
pushing
in
i
myself
should
have
been
more
than
willing
to
wait
outside
but
i
felt
that
it
was
my
duty
by
radnor
to
be
present
if
any
discoveries
were
made
i
wished
to
be
the
first
to
know
it
it
was
sad
business
and
i
will
not
dwell
upon
it
one
side
of
the
old
man
head
had
been
fractured
by
a
heavy
blow
he
had
been
dead
several
hours
when
we
found
him
but
the
doctor
could
not
be
certain
whether
drowning
or
the
injury
he
had
sustained
had
been
the
immediate
cause
of
death
dangling
from
a
jagged
piece
of
rock
half
way
down
the
cliff
we
found
polly
mathers
coat
torn
and
drabbled
with
mud
the
clay
path
above
the
pool
was
trampled
in
every
direction
out
to
the
brink
of
the
precipice
it
was
evident
even
to
the
most
untrained
observer
that
a
fierce
struggle
of
some
sort
had
taken
place
i
was
the
first
one
to
examine
the
marks
and
as
i
knelt
down
and
held
the
light
to
the
ground
i
saw
with
a
thrill
of
mingled
horror
and
hope
that
one
pair
of
feet
had
been
bare
mose
had
taken
part
in
the
struggle
and
dreadful
as
was
the
assurance
it
was
infinitely
better
than
that
other
suspicion
it
was
mose
who
committed
the
murder
i
cried
to
the
coroner
as
i
pointed
to
the
in
the
clay
he
bent
over
beside
me
and
examined
the
marks
ah
mose
was
present
he
said
slowly
but
so
was
someone
else
see
here
is
the
print
of
the
colonel
boot
and
there
beside
it
is
the
print
of
another
boot
it
is
fully
an
inch
broader
but
it
was
difficult
to
make
out
anything
clearly
so
trampled
was
the
path
our
whole
party
had
passed
over
the
very
spot
not
an
hour
before
the
tragedy
whatever
the
others
could
see
i
myself
was
blind
to
everything
but
the
indisputable
fact
that
mose
had
been
there
as
we
were
making
ready
to
start
back
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
a
cry
from
one
of
the
men
called
our
attention
again
to
the
scene
of
the
struggle
he
held
up
in
his
hand
a
small
gleaming
object
which
he
had
found
trodden
into
the
path
it
was
a
silver
match
box
covered
with
dents
and
mud
and
marked
i
recognized
it
instantly
i
had
seen
radnor
take
it
from
his
pocket
a
hundred
times
as
i
looked
at
it
now
my
hope
seemed
to
vanish
and
that
same
sickening
suspicion
rushed
over
me
again
the
men
eyed
each
other
silently
and
i
did
not
have
to
ask
what
they
were
thinking
of
we
turned
without
comments
and
started
on
our
journey
back
to
the
village
the
body
was
carried
to
the
hotel
to
await
the
coroner
permission
to
take
it
home
to
there
was
nothing
more
for
me
to
do
and
with
a
heavy
heart
i
mounted
again
to
return
to
the
plantation
scarcely
had
i
left
the
stable
yard
when
i
heard
hoofs
pounding
along
behind
me
in
the
darkness
and
jim
mattison
galloped
up
with
two
of
his
men
if
you
are
going
to
we
will
ride
with
you
he
said
falling
into
pace
beside
me
while
the
officers
dropped
behind
i
might
as
well
tell
you
he
added
that
it
looks
black
for
radnor
i
sorry
but
it
my
duty
to
keep
him
under
arrest
until
some
pretty
strong
turns
up
where
mose
i
cried
why
do
you
arrest
him
the
sheriff
made
a
gesture
of
disdain
that
nonsense
everyone
in
the
county
knows
mose
he
hurt
a
fly
if
he
was
present
at
the
time
of
the
crime
it
was
to
help
his
master
and
the
man
who
killed
colonel
gaylord
killed
him
too
known
him
all
my
life
and
i
can
swear
he
innocent
you
known
radnor
all
your
life
i
returned
bitterly
yes
he
said
i
have
and
jefferson
gaylord
too
i
rode
on
in
silence
and
i
do
not
think
i
ever
hated
anyone
as
for
the
moment
i
hated
the
man
beside
me
i
knew
that
he
was
thinking
of
polly
mathers
and
i
imagined
that
i
could
detect
an
undertone
of
triumph
in
his
voice
it
well
known
he
went
on
half
to
himself
and
half
to
me
that
radnor
sometimes
had
high
words
with
his
father
and
they
tell
me
at
the
hotel
he
came
back
alone
without
waiting
for
the
others
and
while
his
horse
was
being
saddled
he
drank
off
two
glasses
of
brandy
as
if
they
had
been
water
all
the
men
on
the
veranda
marked
how
white
his
face
was
and
how
he
cursed
the
stable
boy
for
being
slow
it
was
evident
that
something
had
happened
in
the
cave
and
what
with
finding
his
match
box
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
circumstantial
evidence
is
pretty
strong
against
him
i
was
too
miserable
to
think
of
any
answer
and
the
fellow
finally
having
the
decency
to
keep
quiet
we
galloped
the
rest
of
the
way
in
silence
though
it
must
have
been
long
after
midnight
when
we
reached
the
house
lights
were
still
burning
in
the
downstairs
rooms
we
rode
up
to
the
portico
with
considerable
clamor
and
dismounted
one
of
the
men
held
the
horses
while
mattison
and
the
other
followed
me
into
the
house
rad
himself
hearing
the
noise
of
our
arrival
came
to
the
door
to
meet
us
he
was
quite
composed
again
and
spoke
in
his
usual
manner
hello
arnold
did
you
find
him
and
is
the
party
over
he
stopped
uncertainly
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
others
they
stepped
into
the
hall
and
stood
watching
him
a
moment
without
saying
anything
i
tried
to
tell
him
but
the
words
seemed
to
stick
in
my
throat
a
a
terrible
thing
has
happened
rad
i
stammered
out
what
the
matter
he
asked
a
sudden
look
of
anxiety
springing
to
his
face
i
am
sorry
rad
mattison
replied
but
it
is
my
duty
to
arrest
you
to
arrest
me
for
what
he
asked
with
a
half
laugh
for
the
murder
of
your
father
radnor
put
out
his
hand
against
the
wall
to
steady
himself
and
his
lips
showed
white
in
the
lamp
light
at
the
sight
of
his
face
i
could
have
sworn
that
he
was
not
acting
and
that
the
news
came
with
as
much
of
a
shock
to
him
as
it
had
to
me
my
father
murdered
he
gasped
what
do
you
mean
his
dead
body
was
found
in
the
cave
and
circumstantial
evidence
points
to
you
he
seemed
too
dazed
to
grasp
the
words
and
mattison
said
it
twice
before
he
comprehended
do
you
mean
he
dead
rad
repeated
and
i
quarrelled
with
him
last
night
and
would
make
it
up
and
now
it
too
late
i
must
warn
you
the
sheriff
returned
that
whatever
you
say
will
be
used
against
you
i
am
innocent
said
radnor
brokenly
and
without
another
word
he
prepared
to
go
mattison
drew
some
from
his
pocket
and
radnor
looked
at
them
with
a
dark
flush
you
need
be
afraid
i
am
not
going
to
run
away
he
said
mattison
dropped
them
back
again
with
a
muttered
apology
i
went
out
to
the
stable
with
one
of
the
men
and
helped
to
saddle
jennie
loo
i
felt
all
the
time
as
though
i
had
hold
of
the
rope
that
was
going
to
hang
him
when
we
came
back
he
and
the
sheriff
were
standing
on
the
portico
waiting
rad
appeared
to
be
more
composed
than
any
of
us
but
as
i
wrung
his
hand
i
noticed
that
it
was
icy
cold
i
attend
to
everything
i
said
and
do
worry
my
boy
we
get
you
off
do
worry
he
laughed
shortly
as
he
leaped
into
the
saddle
not
myself
i
worrying
over
i
am
innocent
and
he
suddenly
leaned
forward
and
scanned
my
face
in
the
light
from
the
open
door
you
believe
me
he
asked
quickly
yes
i
cried
i
do
and
what
more
i
you
innocent
chapter
xii
i
make
a
promise
to
polly
the
next
few
days
were
a
nightmare
to
me
even
now
i
can
not
think
of
that
horrible
period
of
suspense
and
doubt
without
a
shudder
the
coroner
set
to
work
immediately
upon
his
preliminary
investigation
and
every
bit
of
evidence
that
turned
up
only
seemed
to
make
the
proof
stronger
against
radnor
it
is
strange
how
ready
public
opinion
is
to
believe
the
worst
of
a
man
when
he
is
down
no
one
appeared
to
doubt
rad
guilt
and
feeling
ran
high
against
him
colonel
gaylord
was
a
character
in
the
countryside
and
in
spite
of
his
quick
temper
and
rather
imperious
bearing
he
had
been
a
general
favorite
at
the
news
of
his
death
a
wave
of
horror
and
indignation
swept
through
the
valley
among
the
roughs
in
the
village
i
heard
not
infrequent
hints
of
lynching
and
even
among
the
more
conservative
element
the
general
opinion
seemed
to
be
that
lawful
hanging
was
too
honorable
a
death
for
the
perpetrator
of
so
brutal
a
crime
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
the
quick
and
general
belief
in
the
boy
guilt
but
i
have
always
suspected
that
the
sheriff
did
not
do
all
in
his
power
to
quiet
the
feeling
it
was
to
a
large
extent
however
the
past
reasserting
itself
though
radnor
record
was
not
so
black
as
it
was
painted
still
it
was
not
so
white
as
it
should
have
been
people
shook
their
heads
and
repeated
stories
of
how
wild
he
had
been
as
a
boy
and
how
they
had
always
foreseen
some
such
end
as
this
reports
of
the
quarrels
with
his
father
were
told
and
retold
until
they
were
magnified
beyond
all
recognition
the
old
scandals
about
jeff
were
revived
again
and
the
general
opinion
seemed
to
be
that
the
gaylord
boys
were
degenerates
through
and
through
rad
personal
friends
stood
by
him
staunchly
but
they
formed
a
pitifully
small
minority
compared
to
the
general
public
i
visited
radnor
in
the
kennisburg
jail
on
the
morning
of
my
funeral
and
found
him
quite
broken
in
spirit
he
had
had
time
to
think
over
the
past
and
with
his
father
lying
dead
at
it
had
not
been
pleasant
thinking
now
that
it
was
too
late
he
seemed
filled
with
remorse
over
his
conduct
toward
the
old
man
and
he
dwelt
continually
on
the
fact
of
his
having
been
unwilling
to
make
up
the
quarrel
of
the
night
before
the
murder
in
this
mood
of
contrition
he
mercilessly
accused
himself
of
things
i
am
sure
he
had
never
done
i
knew
that
the
jailer
was
listening
to
every
word
outside
and
i
became
unspeakably
nervous
for
fear
he
would
say
something
which
could
be
twisted
into
an
incriminating
confession
he
did
not
seem
to
comprehend
in
the
least
the
danger
of
his
own
position
he
was
entirely
taken
up
with
the
horror
of
his
father
death
as
i
was
leaving
however
he
suddenly
grasped
my
hand
with
tears
in
his
eyes
tell
me
arnold
do
people
really
believe
me
guilty
i
knew
by
people
he
meant
polly
mathers
but
i
had
not
had
an
opportunity
to
speak
with
her
alone
since
the
day
of
the
tragedy
i
have
talked
to
anyone
but
the
sheriff
i
returned
mattison
would
be
glad
enough
to
prove
it
radnor
said
bitterly
and
he
turned
his
back
and
stood
staring
through
the
iron
bars
of
the
window
while
i
went
out
and
the
jailer
closed
the
door
and
locked
it
all
through
the
funeral
that
afternoon
i
could
scarcely
keep
my
eyes
from
polly
mathers
face
she
appeared
so
changed
since
the
day
of
the
picnic
that
i
should
scarcely
have
known
her
for
the
same
person
it
seemed
incredible
that
three
days
could
make
such
a
difference
in
a
bright
healthy
vigorous
girl
all
her
youthful
vivacity
was
gone
she
was
pale
and
spiritless
with
deep
rings
beneath
her
eyes
and
the
lids
red
with
crying
after
the
services
were
over
i
approached
her
a
moment
as
she
stood
in
her
black
dress
aloof
from
the
others
at
the
edge
of
the
little
family
she
greeted
me
with
a
tremulous
smile
and
then
as
her
glance
wandered
back
to
the
pile
of
earth
that
two
men
were
already
shoveling
into
the
grave
her
eyes
quickly
filled
with
tears
i
loved
him
as
much
as
if
he
were
my
own
father
she
cried
and
my
fault
that
he
dead
i
made
him
go
no
polly
it
is
not
your
fault
i
said
decisively
it
was
a
thing
which
no
one
could
foresee
and
no
one
could
help
she
waited
a
moment
trying
to
steady
her
voice
then
she
looked
up
pleadingly
in
my
face
radnor
is
innocent
tell
me
you
believe
it
i
am
sure
he
is
innocent
i
replied
then
you
can
clear
him
you
a
lawyer
i
know
you
can
clear
him
you
may
trust
me
to
do
my
best
polly
i
hate
jim
mattison
she
exclaimed
with
a
flash
of
her
old
fire
he
swears
that
rad
is
guilty
and
that
he
will
prove
him
so
rad
may
have
done
some
bad
things
but
he
a
good
man
better
than
jim
mattison
ever
thought
of
being
polly
i
said
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
i
wish
you
might
have
realized
that
truth
earlier
rad
is
at
heart
as
splendid
a
chap
as
ever
lived
and
his
friends
ought
never
to
have
allowed
him
to
go
astray
she
looked
away
without
answering
and
then
in
a
moment
turned
back
to
me
and
held
out
her
hand
when
you
see
him
again
please
tell
him
what
i
said
as
she
turned
away
i
looked
after
her
puzzled
i
was
sure
at
last
that
she
was
in
love
with
radnor
and
i
was
equally
sure
that
he
did
not
know
it
for
in
spite
of
his
sorrow
at
his
father
death
and
of
the
suspicion
that
rested
on
him
i
knew
that
he
would
not
have
been
so
completely
crushed
had
he
felt
that
she
was
with
him
why
must
this
come
to
him
now
too
late
to
do
him
any
good
when
he
had
needed
it
so
much
before
i
felt
momentarily
enraged
at
polly
it
seemed
somehow
as
if
the
trouble
might
have
been
avoided
had
she
been
more
straightforward
then
at
the
memory
of
her
pale
face
and
pleading
eyes
i
relented
however
thoughtless
she
had
been
before
she
was
changed
now
this
tragedy
had
somehow
made
a
woman
of
her
over
night
when
radnor
came
at
last
to
claim
her
they
would
each
perhaps
be
worthier
of
the
other
i
returned
to
the
empty
house
that
night
and
sat
down
to
look
the
facts
squarely
in
the
face
i
had
hitherto
been
so
occupied
with
the
necessary
preparations
for
the
funeral
and
with
instituting
a
search
for
mose
that
i
had
scarcely
had
time
to
think
let
alone
map
out
any
logical
plan
of
action
radnor
was
so
stunned
by
the
blow
that
he
could
barely
talk
coherently
and
as
yet
i
had
had
no
satisfactory
interview
with
him
immediately
after
the
colonel
death
i
had
very
hastily
run
over
his
private
papers
but
had
found
little
to
suggest
a
clue
among
some
old
letters
were
several
from
nannie
husband
written
at
the
time
of
her
sickness
and
death
their
tone
was
bitter
could
the
man
have
accomplished
a
tardy
revenge
for
past
insults
i
asked
myself
but
investigation
showed
this
theory
to
be
most
untenable
he
was
still
living
in
the
little
kansas
village
where
she
had
died
had
married
again
and
become
a
peaceful
plodding
citizen
it
required
all
his
present
energy
to
support
his
wife
and
children
i
dare
say
the
brief
episode
of
his
first
marriage
had
almost
faded
from
his
mind
there
was
not
the
slightest
chance
that
he
could
be
implicated
i
sifted
the
papers
again
thoroughly
and
painstakingly
but
found
nothing
that
would
throw
any
light
upon
the
mystery
while
i
was
still
engaged
with
this
task
a
message
came
from
the
coroner
saying
that
the
formal
inquest
would
begin
at
ten
the
next
morning
in
the
kennisburg
this
gave
me
no
chance
to
plan
any
sort
of
campaign
and
i
could
do
little
more
than
let
matters
take
their
course
i
hoped
however
that
in
the
progress
of
the
inquest
some
clue
would
be
brought
to
light
which
would
render
radnor
being
remanded
for
trial
impossible
so
far
i
had
to
acknowledge
the
evidence
against
him
appeared
overwhelming
a
motive
was
supplied
in
the
fact
that
the
colonel
death
would
leave
him
his
own
master
and
a
rich
man
the
fact
of
their
frequent
quarrels
coupled
with
radnor
fierce
temper
and
somewhat
revengeful
disposition
was
a
very
strong
point
in
his
disfavor
added
to
this
the
suspicious
circumstances
of
the
day
of
the
tragedy
the
fact
that
he
was
not
with
the
rest
of
the
party
when
the
crime
must
have
been
committed
the
alleged
print
of
his
boots
and
the
finding
of
the
match
box
his
subsequent
perturbed
condition
everything
pointed
to
him
as
the
author
of
the
crime
it
was
a
most
convincing
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
considering
the
data
that
had
come
to
light
there
seemed
to
be
only
one
alternative
and
that
was
that
mose
had
committed
the
murder
i
clung
tenaciously
to
this
belief
but
i
found
in
the
absence
of
any
further
proof
or
any
conceivable
motive
that
few
people
shared
it
with
me
the
marks
of
his
bare
feet
proved
conclusively
that
he
had
been
in
whatever
capacity
an
active
participator
in
the
struggle
he
was
there
to
aid
his
master
the
sheriff
affirmed
and
being
a
witness
to
the
crime
it
was
necessary
to
put
him
out
of
the
way
why
hide
the
body
of
one
and
not
the
other
i
asked
to
throw
suspicion
on
mose
this
was
the
universal
opinion
no
one
from
the
beginning
would
listen
to
a
word
against
mose
in
his
case
as
well
as
in
radnor
the
past
was
speaking
through
all
his
life
they
said
he
had
faithfully
loved
and
served
the
colonel
and
if
necessity
required
he
would
willingly
have
died
for
him
but
for
myself
i
continued
to
believe
in
the
face
of
all
opposition
that
mose
was
guilty
it
was
more
a
matter
of
feeling
with
me
than
of
reasoning
i
had
always
been
suspicious
of
the
fellow
a
man
with
eyes
like
that
was
capable
of
anything
the
objection
which
the
sheriff
raised
that
colonel
gaylord
was
both
larger
and
stronger
than
mose
and
could
easily
have
overcome
him
proved
nothing
to
my
mind
mose
was
a
small
man
but
he
was
and
wirey
doubtless
far
stronger
than
he
looked
besides
he
had
been
armed
and
the
nature
of
his
weapon
was
clear
the
floor
of
the
cave
was
strewn
with
scores
of
broken
stalactites
nothing
could
have
made
a
more
formidable
weapon
than
one
of
these
long
pieces
of
jagged
stone
used
as
a
club
as
to
the
motive
for
the
crime
who
could
tell
what
went
on
in
the
slow
workings
of
his
mind
the
colonel
had
struck
him
more
than
once
unjustly
i
did
not
doubt
and
though
he
seemed
at
the
moment
to
take
it
meekly
might
he
not
have
been
merely
biding
his
time
his
final
revenge
may
have
been
the
outcome
of
many
hoarded
grievances
that
no
one
knew
existed
the
fellow
was
more
than
half
insane
what
more
likely
than
that
he
had
attacked
his
master
in
a
fit
of
animal
passion
and
then
terrified
at
the
result
escaped
to
the
woods
that
seemed
to
me
the
only
plausible
explanation
no
facts
had
come
out
concerning
the
or
the
robbery
and
i
do
not
think
that
either
was
connected
in
the
public
mind
with
the
murder
but
to
my
mind
the
death
of
colonel
gaylord
was
but
the
climax
of
the
long
series
of
events
which
commenced
on
the
night
of
my
arrival
with
the
slight
and
ludicrous
episode
of
the
stolen
roast
chicken
i
had
been
convinced
at
the
time
that
mose
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
and
i
was
convinced
now
that
he
was
also
at
the
bottom
of
the
robbery
and
the
murder
how
radnor
had
got
drawn
into
the
muddle
of
the
i
could
not
fathom
but
i
suspected
that
mose
had
hoodwinked
him
as
he
had
the
rest
of
us
assuming
that
my
theory
was
right
then
mose
was
hiding
and
all
my
energies
from
the
beginning
had
been
bent
toward
his
discovery
the
low
range
of
mountains
which
lay
between
plantation
and
the
luray
valley
was
covered
thickly
with
woods
and
very
sparsely
settled
mose
knew
every
foot
of
the
ground
he
had
wandered
over
these
mountains
for
days
at
a
time
and
must
have
been
familiar
with
many
hiding
places
it
was
in
this
region
that
i
hoped
to
find
him
immediately
after
the
colonel
death
i
had
offered
a
large
reward
either
for
mose
capture
or
for
any
information
regarding
his
whereabouts
his
description
had
been
telegraphed
all
up
and
down
the
valley
and
every
farmer
was
on
the
alert
bands
of
men
had
been
formed
and
the
woods
scoured
for
him
but
as
yet
without
result
i
was
hourly
expecting
however
that
some
clue
would
come
to
light
the
sheriff
on
the
other
hand
in
pursuance
of
his
theory
that
mose
had
been
murdered
had
been
no
less
indefatigable
in
his
search
for
the
body
the
river
had
been
dragged
the
cave
and
surrounding
woods
searched
but
nothing
had
been
found
mose
had
simply
vanished
from
the
earth
and
left
no
trace
to
my
disappointment
the
morning
still
brought
no
news
i
had
hoped
to
have
something
definite
before
the
inquest
opened
i
rode
into
kennisburg
early
in
order
to
hold
a
conference
with
radnor
and
get
from
him
the
facts
in
regard
to
his
own
and
mose
connection
with
the
my
former
passivity
in
the
matter
struck
me
now
as
almost
criminal
perhaps
had
i
insisted
in
probing
it
to
the
bottom
my
uncle
might
have
been
living
still
i
entered
radnor
cell
determined
not
to
leave
it
until
i
knew
the
truth
but
i
met
with
an
unexpected
obstacle
he
refused
absolutely
to
discuss
the
question
radnor
i
cried
at
last
are
you
trying
to
shield
any
one
do
you
know
who
killed
your
father
i
know
no
more
about
who
killed
my
father
than
you
do
do
you
know
about
the
yes
he
said
desperately
i
do
but
it
is
not
connected
with
either
the
robbery
or
the
murder
and
i
can
not
talk
about
it
i
argued
and
pleaded
but
to
no
effect
he
sat
on
his
cot
his
head
in
his
hands
staring
at
the
floor
stubbornly
refusing
to
open
his
lips
i
gave
over
pleading
and
stormed
it
no
use
arnold
he
said
finally
i
wo
tell
you
anything
about
the
it
does
enter
into
the
case
i
sat
down
again
and
patiently
outlined
my
theory
in
regard
to
mose
it
is
impossible
he
declared
i
have
known
mose
all
my
life
and
i
have
never
yet
known
him
to
betray
a
trust
he
loved
my
father
as
much
as
i
did
and
if
my
life
depended
on
it
i
should
swear
that
he
was
faithful
rad
i
beseeched
i
am
not
only
your
attorney
i
am
your
friend
whatever
you
say
to
me
is
as
if
it
had
never
been
said
i
know
the
truth
he
shook
his
head
i
have
nothing
to
say
you
have
to
have
something
to
say
i
cried
you
have
got
to
go
on
the
stand
and
make
an
absolutely
open
and
straightforward
statement
of
everything
bearing
on
the
case
you
have
got
to
appear
anxious
to
find
and
punish
the
man
who
murdered
your
father
you
have
got
to
gain
public
sympathy
and
before
you
go
on
the
stand
you
owe
it
to
yourself
and
me
to
leave
nothing
unexplained
between
us
he
raised
his
eyes
miserably
to
mine
must
i
go
on
he
asked
ca
i
refuse
to
testify
i
do
see
that
they
can
punish
me
for
contempt
of
court
i
already
in
prison
they
can
hang
you
said
i
bluntly
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
with
a
groan
arnold
he
pleaded
do
make
me
face
all
those
people
you
can
see
what
a
state
my
nerves
are
in
i
have
slept
for
three
nights
he
held
out
his
hand
to
show
me
how
it
trembled
i
ca
talk
i
know
what
i
saying
you
do
know
what
you
urging
me
to
do
my
anger
at
his
stubbornness
vanished
in
a
sudden
spasm
of
pity
the
poor
fellow
was
scarcely
more
than
a
boy
though
i
was
completely
in
the
dark
as
to
what
he
was
holding
back
and
why
he
was
doing
it
yet
i
felt
instinctively
that
his
motives
were
honorable
rad
i
said
it
would
help
your
cause
to
be
open
with
me
and
if
you
are
remanded
for
trial
before
the
grand
jury
you
must
in
the
end
tell
me
everything
but
now
i
will
not
insist
probably
nothing
will
come
up
about
the
i
can
of
course
refuse
to
let
you
speak
on
the
ground
of
incriminating
evidence
but
that
is
the
last
stand
i
wish
to
take
we
must
gain
public
opinion
on
our
side
and
to
that
end
you
must
testify
yourself
you
must
force
every
person
present
to
believe
that
you
are
incapable
of
telling
a
falsehood
i
believe
that
already
and
so
does
polly
mathers
radnor
face
flushed
and
a
quick
light
sprang
into
his
eyes
what
do
you
mean
i
repeated
what
polly
had
said
and
i
added
my
own
interpretation
the
effect
was
electrical
he
straightened
his
shoulders
with
an
air
of
trying
to
throw
off
his
despondency
i
do
my
best
he
promised
heaven
knows
i
like
to
know
the
truth
as
well
as
you
this
doubt
is
simply
hell
a
knock
sounded
on
the
door
and
a
sheriff
officer
informed
us
that
the
hearing
was
about
to
begin
you
have
explained
your
actions
on
the
day
of
the
murder
i
said
hurriedly
i
must
have
a
reason
that
all
right
it
will
come
out
if
you
just
keep
off
the
i
clear
everything
else
if
you
do
that
said
i
immeasurably
relieved
there
be
no
danger
of
your
being
held
for
trial
i
rose
and
held
out
my
hand
courage
my
boy
remember
that
you
are
going
to
prove
your
innocence
not
only
for
your
own
but
for
polly
sake
chapter
xiii
the
inquest
the
coroner
court
was
packed
and
though
here
and
there
i
caught
a
face
that
i
knew
to
be
friendly
to
radnor
the
crowd
was
made
up
for
the
most
part
of
morbid
sensation
seekers
eager
to
hear
and
believe
the
worst
the
district
attorney
was
present
indeed
he
and
the
coroner
and
jim
mattison
were
holding
a
whispered
consultation
when
i
entered
the
room
and
i
did
not
doubt
but
that
the
three
had
been
working
up
the
case
together
the
thought
was
not
reassuring
a
coroner
with
every
appearance
of
fairness
may
still
bias
a
jury
by
the
form
his
questions
take
and
i
myself
was
scarcely
in
a
position
to
turn
the
trend
of
the
inquiry
i
doubt
if
a
lawyer
ever
went
to
an
inquisition
with
less
command
of
the
facts
than
i
had
the
first
witness
called
was
the
doctor
who
made
the
autopsy
after
his
testimony
had
been
dwelt
upon
with
what
seemed
to
me
needless
detail
the
facts
relating
to
the
finding
of
the
body
were
brought
forward
from
this
the
investigation
veered
to
the
subject
of
radnor
strange
behavior
on
the
afternoon
of
the
murder
the
landlord
stable
boy
and
several
of
the
luray
hotel
were
called
to
the
stand
their
testimony
was
practically
identical
and
i
did
not
attempt
to
question
its
truth
what
time
did
radnor
gaylord
come
back
to
the
hotel
the
coroner
asked
of
old
man
tompkins
the
landlord
i
reckon
it
must
been
about
three
in
the
afternoon
please
describe
exactly
what
occurred
well
we
was
sittin
on
the
veranda
talkin
about
one
thing
and
another
when
we
see
young
gaylord
comin
across
the
lot
his
head
down
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
walkin
fast
he
yelled
to
jake
who
was
off
a
buggy
at
the
pump
to
saddle
his
horse
and
be
quick
about
it
then
he
come
up
the
steps
and
into
the
and
called
for
brandy
he
drunk
two
glasses
straight
off
without
blinkin
had
he
ordered
anything
to
drink
in
the
morning
when
they
left
their
horses
the
coroner
interrupted
at
this
point
no
he
did
go
into
the
and
it
was
usually
his
custom
to
slight
us
either
a
titter
ran
around
the
room
and
the
coroner
rapped
for
order
this
is
not
the
place
for
any
cheap
witticisms
you
will
kindly
confine
yourself
to
answering
my
did
gaylord
appear
to
have
been
drinking
when
he
returned
from
the
cave
the
landlord
closed
his
right
eye
speculatively
no
i
ca
say
as
he
exactly
appeared
like
he
been
drinking
he
said
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
but
he
did
seem
to
be
considerably
upset
about
something
he
looked
mad
enough
to
bite
his
face
was
pale
and
his
hand
trembled
when
he
raised
his
glass
three
or
four
noticed
it
and
wondered
very
well
interrupted
the
coroner
what
did
he
do
next
he
went
out
to
the
stable
yard
and
swore
at
the
boy
for
being
slow
and
he
tightened
the
surcingle
himself
with
such
a
jerk
that
the
mare
plunged
and
he
struck
her
he
is
usually
pretty
cranky
about
the
way
horses
is
treated
and
we
wondered
he
was
stopped
again
and
invited
to
go
on
without
wondering
well
let
me
see
said
the
witness
imperturbably
he
jumped
into
the
saddle
and
slashing
the
mare
across
the
flanks
started
off
in
a
cloud
o
dust
without
so
much
as
looking
back
we
was
all
surprised
at
this
he
usually
pretty
friendly
and
we
talked
about
it
after
but
we
did
think
nothing
particular
till
the
news
o
the
murder
come
that
evening
when
we
naturally
commenced
to
put
two
and
two
together
at
this
point
i
protested
and
the
landlord
was
excused
jake
henley
the
stable
boy
was
called
his
testimony
practically
covered
the
same
ground
and
corroborated
what
the
landlord
had
said
you
say
he
swore
at
you
for
being
slow
the
coroner
asked
jake
nodded
with
a
grin
i
do
remember
just
the
words
i
get
swore
at
so
much
that
it
do
make
the
impression
it
might
but
it
was
good
straight
cussin
all
right
and
he
struck
you
as
being
agitated
jake
grin
broadened
i
think
you
might
say
agitated
he
admitted
guardedly
he
was
mad
enough
to
begin
with
an
now
the
brandy
was
gettin
to
work
besides
he
was
in
an
hurry
to
leave
before
the
rest
o
the
party
come
back
an
while
i
was
bringin
out
the
horse
he
heard
laughin
they
was
in
sight
yet
but
they
was
makin
a
lot
o
noise
one
o
the
girls
had
stepped
on
a
snake
an
was
loud
enough
to
hear
her
two
miles
off
and
gaylord
left
before
any
of
them
saw
him
the
boy
nodded
he
got
off
all
right
forgot
to
pay
for
your
horse
i
yelled
after
him
and
he
threw
me
fifty
cents
and
it
landed
in
the
this
ended
his
testimony
several
members
of
the
picnic
party
were
next
called
upon
and
nothing
very
damaging
to
radnor
was
produced
he
seemed
to
be
in
his
usual
spirits
before
entering
the
cave
and
no
one
it
transpired
had
seen
him
after
he
came
out
though
this
was
not
noted
at
the
time
also
no
one
had
noticed
him
in
conversation
with
his
father
the
coroner
dwelt
upon
this
point
but
elicited
no
information
one
way
or
the
other
polly
mathers
was
not
present
she
had
been
subpoenaed
but
had
become
too
ill
and
nervous
to
stand
the
strain
and
the
doctor
had
forbidden
her
attendance
the
coroner
however
had
taken
her
testimony
at
the
house
and
his
clerk
read
it
aloud
to
the
jury
it
dealt
merely
with
the
matter
of
the
coat
and
where
she
had
last
seen
radnor
you
notice
anything
peculiar
in
the
behavior
of
radnor
gaylord
on
the
day
of
his
father
death
especially
peculiar
no
you
see
any
circumstance
which
led
you
to
suspect
that
he
and
his
father
were
not
on
good
terms
they
both
appeared
as
usual
you
speak
to
radnor
in
the
cave
we
strolled
about
together
for
a
time
and
he
was
carrying
my
coat
he
laid
it
down
on
the
broken
column
and
forgot
it
i
forgot
it
too
and
did
think
of
it
again
until
we
were
out
of
the
cave
then
i
happened
to
mention
it
in
colonel
gaylord
presence
and
i
suppose
he
went
back
for
it
did
see
radnor
gaylord
after
he
left
the
cave
i
did
see
him
after
we
left
the
gallery
of
the
broken
column
the
guide
struck
off
a
calcium
light
to
show
us
the
formation
of
the
ceiling
we
spent
about
five
minutes
examining
the
room
and
after
that
we
all
went
on
in
a
group
radnor
had
not
waited
to
see
the
room
but
had
gone
on
ahead
in
the
direction
of
the
entrance
so
much
for
polly
testimony
which
added
nothing
solomon
frightened
almost
out
of
his
wits
was
called
on
next
and
his
testimony
brought
out
the
matter
of
the
quarrel
between
colonel
gaylord
and
radnor
solomon
told
of
finding
the
french
clock
and
a
great
many
things
besides
which
i
am
sure
he
made
up
i
wished
to
have
his
testimony
ruled
out
but
the
coroner
seemed
to
feel
that
it
was
suggestive
as
it
undoubtedly
was
and
he
allowed
it
to
remain
radnor
himself
was
next
called
to
the
stand
as
he
took
his
place
a
murmur
of
excitement
swept
over
the
room
and
there
was
a
general
straining
forward
he
was
composed
and
quiet
and
very
very
sober
every
bit
of
animation
had
left
his
face
the
coroner
commenced
immediately
with
the
subject
of
the
quarrel
with
his
father
on
the
night
before
the
murder
and
radnor
answered
all
the
questions
frankly
and
openly
he
made
no
attempt
to
gloss
over
any
of
the
details
what
put
the
matter
in
a
peculiarly
bad
light
was
the
fact
that
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
had
been
over
a
question
of
money
rad
had
requested
his
father
to
settle
a
definite
amount
on
him
so
that
he
would
be
independent
in
the
future
and
his
father
had
refused
they
had
lost
their
tempers
and
had
gone
further
than
usual
in
telling
the
story
radnor
openly
took
the
blame
upon
himself
where
in
several
instances
i
strongly
suspected
that
it
should
have
been
laid
at
the
door
of
the
colonel
but
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
story
revealed
a
pitiable
state
of
affairs
as
between
father
and
son
his
frankness
in
assuming
the
responsibility
won
for
him
more
sympathy
than
had
been
shown
since
the
murder
how
did
the
clock
get
broken
the
coroner
asked
my
father
knocked
it
off
the
mantelpiece
onto
the
floor
he
did
not
throw
it
at
you
as
solomon
surmised
radnor
raised
his
head
with
a
glint
of
anger
it
fell
on
the
floor
and
broke
have
you
often
had
quarrels
with
your
father
occasionally
he
had
a
quick
temper
and
always
wished
his
own
way
and
i
was
not
so
patient
with
him
as
i
should
have
been
what
did
you
quarrel
about
different
things
what
for
instance
sometimes
because
he
thought
i
spent
too
much
money
sometimes
over
a
question
of
managing
the
estate
occasionally
because
he
had
heard
gossip
about
me
what
do
you
mean
by
stories
that
i
been
gambling
or
drinking
too
much
were
the
stories
true
they
were
always
exaggerated
and
this
quarrel
the
night
before
his
death
was
more
serious
than
usual
possibly
yes
you
did
not
speak
to
each
other
at
the
breakfast
table
no
radnor
face
was
set
in
strained
lines
it
was
evident
that
this
was
a
very
painful
subject
did
you
have
any
conversation
later
only
a
few
words
please
repeat
what
was
said
radnor
appeared
to
hesitate
and
then
replied
a
trifle
wearily
that
he
did
not
remember
the
exact
words
that
it
was
merely
a
recapitulation
of
what
had
been
said
the
night
before
upon
being
urged
to
give
the
gist
of
the
conversation
he
replied
that
his
father
had
wished
to
make
up
their
quarrel
but
on
the
old
basis
and
he
had
refused
the
colonel
had
repeated
that
he
was
still
too
young
a
man
to
give
over
his
affairs
into
the
hands
of
another
that
he
had
a
good
many
years
before
him
in
which
he
intended
to
be
his
own
master
radnor
had
replied
that
he
was
too
old
a
man
to
be
treated
any
longer
as
a
boy
and
that
he
would
go
away
and
work
where
he
would
be
paid
for
what
he
did
and
may
i
ask
the
coroner
inquired
placidly
whether
you
had
any
particular
work
in
mind
when
you
made
that
statement
or
was
it
merely
a
figure
of
rhetoric
calculated
to
bring
colonel
gaylord
to
terms
rad
scowled
and
said
nothing
and
the
rest
of
his
answers
were
terseness
itself
did
you
and
your
father
have
any
further
conversation
on
the
ride
over
or
in
the
course
of
the
day
no
you
purposely
avoided
meeting
each
other
i
suppose
so
then
those
words
after
breakfast
when
you
threatened
to
leave
home
were
absolutely
the
last
words
you
ever
spoke
to
your
father
it
was
a
subject
radnor
did
not
like
to
think
about
his
lips
trembled
slightly
and
he
answered
with
a
visible
effort
yes
a
slight
murmur
ran
around
the
room
partly
of
sympathy
partly
of
doubt
the
coroner
put
the
same
question
again
and
radnor
repeated
his
answer
this
time
with
a
flush
of
anger
the
coroner
paused
a
moment
and
then
continued
without
comment
you
entered
the
cave
with
the
rest
of
the
party
yes
but
you
left
the
others
before
they
had
made
the
complete
round
yes
why
was
that
i
was
not
particularly
interested
i
had
seen
the
cave
many
times
before
where
did
you
leave
the
party
i
believe
in
the
gallery
of
the
broken
column
you
left
the
cave
immediately
yes
did
you
enter
it
again
no
you
forgot
miss
mathers
coat
and
left
it
in
the
gallery
of
the
broken
column
so
it
would
seem
did
you
not
think
of
that
later
and
go
back
for
it
radnor
snapped
out
his
answer
no
i
did
think
anything
about
the
coat
are
you
in
the
habit
of
leaving
young
ladies
coats
about
in
that
way
a
titter
ran
about
the
room
and
rad
did
not
deign
to
notice
this
question
i
was
indignant
that
the
boy
should
be
made
to
face
such
an
ordeal
this
was
not
a
regular
trial
and
the
coroner
had
no
right
to
be
more
obnoxious
than
his
calling
required
there
was
a
glint
of
anger
in
radnor
eyes
and
i
was
uneasily
aware
that
he
no
longer
cared
what
impression
he
made
his
answers
to
the
rest
of
the
questions
were
as
short
as
the
english
language
permitted
what
did
you
do
after
leaving
the
cave
went
home
please
go
into
more
detail
what
did
you
do
immediately
after
leaving
the
cave
strolled
through
the
woods
for
how
long
i
do
know
how
long
do
you
think
possibly
half
an
hour
then
what
did
you
do
returned
to
the
hotel
ordered
my
horse
and
rode
home
why
did
you
not
wait
for
the
rest
of
the
party
did
feel
like
it
the
question
was
repeated
in
several
ways
but
radnor
stubbornly
refused
to
discuss
the
matter
he
had
promised
me
the
last
thing
before
coming
to
the
hearing
that
he
would
clear
up
the
suspicious
points
in
regard
to
his
conduct
on
the
day
of
the
crime
i
took
him
in
hand
myself
but
i
could
get
nothing
more
from
him
than
the
coroner
had
elicited
for
some
reason
he
had
veered
completely
and
his
manner
warned
me
not
to
push
the
matter
i
took
my
seat
and
the
questioning
continued
gaylord
said
the
coroner
severely
you
have
heard
the
evidence
respecting
your
peculiar
behavior
when
you
returned
to
the
hotel
three
witnesses
have
stated
that
you
were
in
an
unnaturally
perturbed
condition
is
this
true
radnor
supposed
it
must
be
true
he
did
not
wish
to
question
the
gentlemen
veracity
he
did
not
remember
himself
what
he
had
done
but
there
seemed
to
be
plenty
of
witnesses
who
did
remember
can
you
give
any
reasons
for
your
strange
conduct
i
have
told
you
several
times
already
that
i
can
not
i
did
not
feel
well
and
that
is
all
there
was
to
it
a
low
murmur
of
incredulity
ran
around
the
room
it
was
evident
to
everyone
that
he
was
holding
something
back
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
fast
losing
the
sympathy
he
had
gained
in
the
beginning
i
myself
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
his
behavior
as
i
was
absolutely
in
the
dark
however
i
could
do
nothing
but
let
matters
take
their
course
radnor
was
excused
with
this
and
the
next
half
hour
was
spent
in
a
consideration
of
the
that
were
found
in
the
clay
path
at
the
scene
of
the
murder
the
marks
of
mose
were
admitted
immediately
but
the
others
occasioned
considerable
discussion
facsimiles
of
the
prints
were
produced
and
compared
with
the
riding
boots
which
the
colonel
and
radnor
had
worn
at
the
time
the
print
was
unmistakable
but
i
myself
did
not
think
that
the
alleged
print
of
radnor
boot
tallied
very
perfectly
with
the
boot
itself
the
jury
seemed
satisfied
however
and
radnor
was
called
upon
for
an
explanation
his
only
conjecture
was
that
it
was
the
print
he
had
left
when
he
passed
over
the
path
on
his
way
to
the
entrance
the
print
was
not
in
the
path
he
was
informed
it
was
in
the
wet
clay
on
the
edge
of
the
precipice
radnor
shrugged
in
that
case
it
could
not
be
the
print
of
his
boot
he
had
kept
to
the
path
in
regard
to
the
match
box
he
was
equally
unsatisfactory
he
acknowledged
that
it
was
his
but
could
no
more
account
for
its
presence
in
the
path
than
the
coroner
himself
when
do
you
remember
having
seen
it
last
the
coroner
inquired
radnor
pondered
i
remember
lending
it
to
mathers
when
she
was
building
a
fire
in
the
woods
to
make
the
coffee
after
that
i
remember
anything
about
it
how
do
you
account
for
its
presence
at
the
scene
of
the
murder
i
can
only
conjecture
that
it
must
have
dropped
from
my
pocket
without
my
noticing
it
on
my
way
out
of
the
cave
the
coroner
observed
that
it
was
an
unfortunate
coincidence
that
he
had
dropped
it
in
just
that
particular
spot
this
effectually
stopped
radnor
testimony
not
another
word
could
be
elicited
from
him
on
the
subject
and
he
was
finally
dismissed
and
mathers
called
to
the
stand
she
remembered
borrowing
the
match
box
but
then
someone
had
called
her
away
and
she
could
not
remember
what
she
had
done
with
it
she
thought
she
must
have
returned
it
because
she
always
did
return
things
but
she
was
not
at
all
sure
very
possibly
she
had
kept
it
and
dropped
it
herself
on
her
way
out
of
the
cave
it
was
evident
that
she
did
not
wish
to
say
anything
which
would
incriminate
radnor
and
she
was
really
too
perturbed
to
remember
what
she
had
done
several
other
people
were
questioned
but
no
further
light
could
be
thrown
on
the
subject
of
the
match
box
and
so
it
remained
in
the
end
as
it
had
been
in
the
beginning
merely
a
very
nasty
piece
of
circumstantial
evidence
this
ended
the
hearing
for
the
day
and
the
inquest
was
postponed
until
ten
the
following
morning
so
far
no
word
had
been
dropped
touching
the
but
i
was
filled
with
apprehension
as
to
what
the
next
day
would
bring
forth
i
knew
that
if
the
subject
came
up
it
would
end
once
for
all
radnor
chances
of
escaping
trial
before
the
grand
jury
and
that
would
mean
at
the
best
two
months
more
of
prison
what
it
would
mean
at
the
worst
i
did
not
like
to
consider
chapter
xiv
the
jury
verdict
my
first
glance
about
the
room
the
next
morning
showed
me
only
too
plainly
what
direction
the
inquiry
was
going
to
take
in
the
farther
corner
half
hidden
by
mattison
broad
back
sat
clancy
the
washington
detective
i
recognized
him
with
an
angry
feeling
of
discouragement
if
we
were
to
have
his
version
of
the
stolen
bonds
radnor
last
hope
of
gaining
public
sympathy
was
gone
radnor
was
the
first
person
to
be
called
to
the
stand
he
had
not
noticed
the
detective
and
i
did
not
have
a
chance
to
inform
him
of
his
presence
the
coroner
plunged
immediately
into
the
question
of
the
robbery
and
the
and
it
was
only
too
evident
from
troubled
eyes
that
it
was
a
subject
he
did
not
wish
to
talk
about
you
have
recently
had
a
robbery
at
your
house
mr
gaylord
yes
please
describe
just
what
was
stolen
five
bonds
government
four
per
cents
a
bag
of
coin
about
twenty
dollars
in
all
and
two
deeds
and
an
insurance
policy
you
have
not
been
able
to
trace
the
thief
no
in
spite
of
every
effort
well
we
naturally
looked
into
the
matter
but
you
have
been
able
to
form
no
theory
as
to
how
the
bonds
were
stolen
no
i
have
no
theory
whatever
you
employed
a
detective
i
believe
yes
and
he
arrived
at
no
theory
radnor
hesitated
visibly
while
he
framed
an
answer
he
arrived
at
no
theory
which
successfully
covered
the
facts
but
he
did
have
a
theory
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
bonds
did
he
not
yes
but
it
was
without
any
foundation
and
i
prefer
not
to
go
into
it
the
coroner
abandoned
the
point
gaylord
there
has
lately
been
a
rumor
among
the
negroes
working
at
your
place
in
regard
to
the
appearance
of
a
ghost
has
there
not
yes
can
you
offer
any
light
on
the
subject
the
negroes
are
superstitious
and
easily
frightened
when
the
rumor
of
a
ghost
gets
started
it
grows
the
most
of
the
stories
existed
only
in
their
own
imaginations
you
believe
then
that
there
was
no
foundation
whatever
to
any
of
the
stories
i
should
rather
not
go
into
that
gaylord
do
you
believe
that
the
ghost
had
any
connection
with
the
robbery
no
i
do
not
do
you
think
that
the
ghost
had
any
connection
with
the
murder
of
your
father
no
said
radnor
that
is
all
mr
james
clancy
at
the
name
radnor
suddenly
raised
his
head
and
half
turned
back
as
if
to
speak
but
thinking
better
of
it
he
resumed
his
chair
and
watched
the
approach
of
the
detective
with
an
angry
frown
clancy
did
not
glance
at
radnor
but
gave
his
evidence
in
a
quick
incisive
way
which
forced
the
breathless
attention
of
every
one
in
the
room
he
told
without
interruption
the
story
of
his
arrival
at
and
his
conclusions
in
regard
to
the
and
the
theft
he
omitted
however
all
mention
of
the
letter
am
i
to
understand
that
you
never
made
your
conclusions
known
to
colonel
gaylord
the
coroner
asked
no
i
had
been
employed
by
him
but
i
thought
under
the
circumstances
it
was
kinder
to
leave
him
in
ignorance
that
was
a
generous
stand
to
take
i
suppose
you
lost
something
in
the
way
of
a
fee
the
detective
looked
slightly
uncomfortable
over
the
question
well
no
as
it
happened
i
did
there
was
a
sort
of
cousin
crosby
he
nodded
toward
me
visiting
in
the
house
and
he
footed
the
bill
he
seemed
to
think
the
young
man
had
intended
to
steal
and
that
it
would
be
pleasanter
all
around
if
i
left
it
for
them
to
settle
between
themselves
i
protest
i
cried
i
distinctly
stated
my
conviction
that
radnor
gaylord
knew
nothing
of
the
bonds
and
i
paid
him
to
get
rid
of
him
because
i
did
not
wish
him
troubling
colonel
gaylord
with
any
such
story
clancy
is
testifying
observed
the
coroner
now
clancy
as
i
understand
it
you
discovered
as
you
supposed
the
guilty
man
and
instead
of
going
to
your
employer
with
the
story
and
receiving
your
pay
from
him
you
accepted
it
from
the
person
you
had
accused
or
at
least
from
his
friend
i
explained
the
circumstances
it
was
a
mere
matter
of
accommodation
i
suppose
you
know
what
such
accommodation
is
called
if
you
mean
it
was
blackmail
that
false
at
least
he
added
quickly
relapsing
into
good
nature
it
was
a
mighty
generous
kind
of
blackmail
i
could
have
got
my
pay
fast
enough
from
the
colonel
but
i
did
want
to
stir
up
trouble
we
all
know
that
it
is
the
innocent
who
pay
blackmail
he
added
parenthetically
do
you
mean
to
insinuate
that
crosby
is
implicated
lord
no
he
as
innocent
as
a
lamb
young
gaylord
was
too
smart
for
him
he
hoodwinked
him
as
well
as
the
colonel
into
believing
the
bonds
were
stolen
while
he
was
out
of
the
house
a
smile
ran
around
the
room
and
the
detective
was
excused
i
sprang
to
my
feet
one
moment
i
said
i
should
like
to
ask
clancy
some
questions
the
young
man
was
turned
over
to
me
plainly
against
his
wishes
what
proof
have
you
clancy
that
the
bonds
were
not
stolen
while
gaylord
was
out
of
the
house
well
my
investigations
led
me
to
the
belief
that
he
stole
them
and
that
being
the
case
it
must
have
been
done
before
he
left
the
house
i
see
and
your
investigations
concerned
themselves
largely
with
a
letter
which
you
filched
from
gaylord
coat
pocket
in
the
night
did
they
not
not
entirely
the
letter
merely
struck
me
as
corroborative
evidence
though
i
have
since
learned
clancy
i
interrupted
sternly
did
you
not
tell
me
at
the
time
that
that
letter
was
absolute
proof
of
his
guilt
yes
or
no
i
may
have
said
so
but
clancy
will
you
kindly
repeat
what
was
in
that
letter
it
referred
to
some
bonds
i
do
know
that
i
can
recall
the
exact
words
then
i
must
request
you
to
read
it
i
returned
picking
it
out
from
a
bundle
of
papers
on
the
table
and
handing
it
to
him
i
am
sorry
to
take
up
so
much
time
with
a
matter
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
murder
i
added
to
the
coroner
but
you
yourself
brought
up
the
subject
and
it
is
only
fair
to
hear
the
whole
story
he
nodded
permission
and
ordered
clancy
to
read
the
letter
the
detective
did
so
amidst
an
astonished
hush
it
struck
everyone
as
a
proof
of
guilt
and
no
one
could
understand
why
i
had
forced
it
to
the
front
now
clancy
said
i
please
tell
the
jury
explanation
of
this
letter
clancy
with
a
somewhat
sheepish
air
gave
the
gist
of
what
radnor
had
said
did
you
believe
that
story
when
you
first
heard
it
i
asked
no
said
he
i
did
not
because
very
well
but
you
later
went
to
the
office
of
jacoby
haight
and
looked
over
the
files
of
their
correspondence
with
radnor
gaylord
and
verified
his
statement
in
every
particular
did
you
not
yes
i
did
but
still
that
is
all
i
wish
to
ask
clancy
i
think
the
reason
is
evident
i
added
turning
to
the
jury
why
i
was
willing
to
pay
in
order
to
get
rid
of
him
nobody
character
nobody
correspondence
was
safe
while
he
was
in
the
house
the
detective
retired
amidst
general
laughter
and
i
could
see
that
feeling
had
veered
again
in
radnor
favor
the
total
effect
of
the
evidence
respecting
the
and
the
robbery
was
good
rather
than
bad
and
i
more
than
fancied
that
i
was
indebted
to
the
sheriff
for
it
radnor
was
not
called
again
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
testimony
in
regard
to
him
the
rest
of
the
time
was
taken
up
with
a
consideration
of
mose
and
some
further
questioning
of
the
negroes
in
regard
to
the
old
nancy
created
considerable
diversion
with
her
account
of
the
spirited
roast
chicken
it
had
changed
materially
since
i
heard
it
last
she
was
emphatic
in
her
statement
that
marse
rad
did
have
nuffen
to
do
wif
him
he
was
a
sho
nuff
an
his
gahments
smelt
de
graveyard
the
evidence
respecting
mose
brought
out
nothing
of
any
consequence
and
with
that
the
hearing
was
brought
to
a
close
the
coroner
instructed
the
jury
on
two
or
three
points
of
law
and
ended
with
the
brief
formula
you
have
heard
the
testimony
given
by
these
witnesses
it
remains
for
you
to
do
your
duty
after
an
interminable
half
hour
the
filed
back
to
their
seats
and
the
clerk
read
the
verdict
we
find
that
the
said
richard
gaylord
came
to
his
death
in
luray
cavern
on
the
day
of
may
by
cerebral
hemorrhage
the
result
of
a
wound
inflicted
by
some
blunt
weapon
in
the
hands
of
a
person
or
persons
unknown
we
recommend
that
radnor
fanshaw
gaylord
be
held
for
trial
before
the
grand
jury
rad
appeared
dazed
at
the
verdict
though
in
the
face
of
the
evidence
and
his
own
stubborn
refusal
to
explain
it
i
do
see
how
he
could
have
expected
any
other
outcome
as
for
myself
it
was
better
than
i
had
feared
chapter
xv
false
clues
the
fight
had
now
fairly
begun
the
district
attorney
was
working
up
the
side
of
the
prosecution
aided
i
was
sure
by
the
sheriff
it
remained
for
me
to
map
out
some
definite
plan
of
action
and
organize
the
defence
as
i
rode
back
to
in
the
early
evening
after
the
inquest
i
continued
to
dwell
upon
the
evidence
searching
blindly
for
some
clue
the
question
which
returned
most
persistently
to
my
mind
was
what
has
become
of
mose
it
was
clear
now
that
upon
the
answer
to
this
question
hinged
the
ultimate
solution
of
the
mystery
i
still
clung
to
the
belief
that
he
was
guilty
and
in
hiding
but
five
days
had
elapsed
since
the
murder
and
no
trace
of
him
had
been
discovered
it
seemed
incredible
that
a
man
however
well
he
might
know
his
ground
could
with
a
whole
county
on
his
track
elude
detection
so
effectually
supposing
after
all
that
he
were
not
guilty
but
the
sheriff
theory
that
he
had
been
killed
and
the
body
concealed
were
true
then
who
besides
radnor
could
have
had
any
motive
for
committing
the
crime
there
was
nothing
from
the
past
that
afforded
even
the
suggestion
of
a
clue
the
old
man
seemed
to
have
had
no
enemies
but
his
sons
his
sons
the
thought
of
jeff
suddenly
sprang
into
my
mind
if
anyone
on
earth
owed
the
colonel
a
grudge
it
was
his
elder
son
and
jeff
had
more
than
his
share
of
the
gaylord
spirit
which
could
not
lightly
forgive
an
injury
could
he
have
returned
secretly
to
the
neighborhood
and
following
his
father
into
the
cave
have
quarreled
with
him
heaven
knows
he
had
cause
enough
he
may
in
his
anger
have
struck
the
old
man
without
knowing
what
he
was
doing
and
overcome
with
horror
at
the
result
have
left
him
and
fled
i
was
almost
as
reluctant
to
believe
him
guilty
of
the
crime
as
to
believe
it
of
radnor
but
the
thought
having
once
come
would
not
be
dismissed
i
knew
that
he
had
sunk
pretty
low
in
the
nine
years
since
his
disappearance
but
i
could
never
think
of
him
otherwise
than
as
i
myself
remembered
him
he
had
been
the
hero
of
my
boyhood
and
i
revolted
from
the
thought
of
deliberately
setting
out
to
prove
him
guilty
of
his
father
murder
i
spurred
my
horse
into
a
gallop
miserably
trying
to
escape
from
my
suspicion
but
the
more
i
put
it
from
me
as
impossible
the
surer
i
became
that
at
last
i
had
stumbled
on
a
clue
automatically
i
began
adjusting
the
evidence
to
fit
this
new
theory
and
reluctant
as
i
was
to
see
it
every
circumstance
from
the
beginning
fitted
it
perfectly
jeff
had
returned
secretly
to
the
neighborhood
had
taken
up
his
abode
in
the
old
negro
cabins
and
made
his
presence
known
only
to
mose
mose
had
stolen
the
chicken
for
him
and
the
various
other
missing
articles
they
had
resurrected
the
to
frighten
the
negroes
away
from
the
laurel
walk
and
the
night
of
the
party
rad
in
his
masquerade
had
accidentally
discovered
his
brother
jeff
demanded
money
and
rad
undertook
to
supply
it
in
order
to
get
him
away
without
his
knowing
that
was
why
he
had
borrowed
the
hundred
dollars
from
me
and
had
written
to
his
brokers
to
sell
the
bonds
it
was
jeff
who
was
sitting
beside
radnor
the
night
they
drove
across
the
lawn
but
unknown
to
rad
jeff
had
found
his
way
back
and
had
robbed
the
safe
and
rad
suspecting
it
had
refused
to
make
an
investigation
during
the
eleven
days
that
intervened
between
the
robbery
and
the
murder
jeff
had
still
been
hiding
in
the
vicinity
possibly
in
the
neighborhood
of
luray
certainly
no
longer
in
the
cabins
for
he
had
no
desire
to
meet
his
brother
but
on
the
day
of
the
picnic
they
had
met
and
quarreled
rad
had
charged
him
with
the
robbery
and
they
had
parted
in
a
high
state
of
anger
this
would
explain
rad
actions
in
the
hotel
his
white
face
later
when
i
found
him
in
the
summer
house
and
jeff
still
quivering
from
the
accusation
had
gone
back
into
the
cave
and
met
his
father
as
the
old
man
was
coming
from
the
little
gallery
of
the
broken
column
with
polly
mathers
coat
what
had
happened
there
i
did
not
like
to
consider
they
both
had
uncontrolled
tempers
and
in
the
past
there
had
been
wrongs
on
both
sides
probably
jeff
blow
had
been
harder
than
he
meant
in
the
evening
when
mattison
and
i
brought
the
news
of
the
murder
rad
must
have
known
instantly
who
was
the
real
culprit
that
was
why
he
had
kept
silent
that
was
why
he
so
vehemently
insisted
on
mose
innocence
i
had
found
the
light
at
last
though
the
darkness
had
been
almost
better
what
must
i
do
i
asked
myself
was
it
my
duty
to
search
out
jefferson
and
convict
him
of
this
crime
no
one
could
tell
what
provocation
he
may
have
had
why
not
let
matters
take
their
course
there
was
nothing
but
circumstantial
evidence
against
radnor
surely
no
jury
would
convict
him
on
that
i
could
work
up
a
sufficient
case
against
mose
to
assure
his
acquittal
he
would
be
released
with
a
blot
on
his
name
he
would
be
regarded
for
the
rest
of
his
life
with
suspicion
but
in
any
event
there
seemed
to
be
no
outcome
which
would
not
involve
the
family
in
endless
trouble
and
disgrace
and
besides
if
he
himself
elected
to
be
silent
had
i
any
right
to
speak
then
i
pulled
myself
together
yes
it
was
not
only
right
for
me
to
speak
it
was
my
duty
rad
should
not
be
allowed
to
sacrifice
himself
the
truth
at
whatever
cost
must
be
brought
out
my
first
move
must
be
to
discover
jeff
whereabouts
on
the
day
of
his
father
murder
it
ought
not
to
be
difficult
to
trace
a
man
who
had
come
more
than
once
under
the
surveillance
of
the
police
having
made
up
my
mind
as
to
the
necessary
course
i
lost
no
time
in
putting
it
into
action
i
barely
waited
to
snatch
a
hasty
supper
before
riding
back
to
the
village
from
there
i
sent
a
telegram
to
the
chief
of
police
in
seattle
asking
for
any
information
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
jefferson
gaylord
on
the
nineteenth
of
may
it
was
ten
the
next
morning
before
an
answer
came
so
sure
was
i
of
what
it
was

words

henry

i
had
become
so
obsessed
with
the
horror
of
my
new
theory
so
sure
that
jeff
was
the
murderer
of
his
father
that
i
could
not
readjust
my
thoughts
to
the
idea
that
he
had
been
at
the
time
of
the
crime
three
thousand
miles
away
the
case
then
still
stood
exactly
where
it
had
stood
from
the
beginning
six
days
had
passed
since
the
murder
and
i
was
not
one
inch
nearer
the
truth
six
days
i
realized
it
with
a
dull
feeling
of
hopelessness
every
day
now
that
was
allowed
to
pass
only
lessened
the
chance
of
our
ever
finding
mose
and
solving
the
mystery
i
still
stood
with
the
telegram
in
my
hand
staring
at
the
words
i
was
vaguely
aware
that
a
boy
from
miller
place
had
ridden
up
to
the
house
on
a
bicycle
but
not
until
solomon
approached
with
a
second
yellow
envelope
in
his
hand
was
i
jostled
back
into
a
state
of
comprehension

mars

i
snatched
it
from
him
and
ripped
it
open
hoping
against
hope
that
at
last
a
clue
had
turned
up

arrive
lambert
junction
terence
k
patten
under
the
terrible
strain
of
the
past
six
days
i
had
completely
forgotten
terry
existence
and
now
the
memory
of
his
cool
impertinence
came
back
to
me
with
a
rush
for
the
first
moment
i
felt
too
angry
to
think
i
had
not
credited
even
his
presumption
with
anything
like
this
his
interference
in
the
business
was
bad
enough
but
he
might
have
realized
that
this
was
a
personal
matter
he
was
calmly
proposing
to
turn
this
horrible
tragedy
into
a
story
for
the
sunday
papers
and
that
to
a
member
of
the
murdered
man
own
family
hot
with
indignation
i
tore
the
telegram
into
shreds
and
stalked
into
the
house
i
paced
up
and
down
the
hall
for
fifteen
minutes
planning
what
i
should
say
to
him
when
he
arrived
and
then
as
i
calmed
down
i
commenced
to
see
the
thing
in
its
true
light
the
whole
account
of
the
crime
to
the
minutest
detail
had
already
appeared
in
every
newspaper
in
the
country
together
with
the
most
outrageous
stories
of
radnor
past
career
at
least
nothing
could
be
worse
than
what
had
already
been
said
and
after
all
was
not
the
truth
any
truth
better
than
these
vague
suspicions
this
terrible
suspense
terry
could
find
the
truth
if
any
man
on
earth
could
do
it
he
had
i
knew
unraveled
other
tangles
as
mysterious
as
this
he
was
used
to
this
sort
of
work
and
bringing
to
the
matter
a
fresh
mind
would
see
light
where
it
was
only
darkness
to
me
i
had
been
under
such
a
terrific
strain
for
so
long
and
had
borne
so
much
responsibility
that
the
very
thought
of
having
someone
with
whom
i
could
share
it
gave
me
new
strength
my
feeling
toward
him
veered
suddenly
from
indignation
to
gratitude
his
irrepressible
confidence
in
himself
inspired
me
with
a
like
confidence
and
i
wondered
what
i
had
been
thinking
of
that
i
had
not
sent
for
him
at
once
to
my
jaded
mind
his
promised
arrival
appeared
better
than
a
clue
it
was
almost
equal
to
a
solution
chapter
xvi
terry
comes
the
moment
i
caught
sight
of
terry
as
he
swung
off
the
train
i
felt
involuntarily
that
my
troubles
were
near
their
end
his
sharp
eager
face
with
its
firm
jaw
and
quick
eye
inspired
one
with
the
feeling
that
he
could
find
the
bottom
of
any
mystery
it
was
with
a
deep
breath
of
relief
that
i
held
out
my
hand
hello
old
man
how
are
you
he
exclaimed
with
a
smile
of
cordiality
as
he
grasped
it
and
then
recalling
the
gravity
of
the
situation
he
with
some
difficulty
pulled
a
sober
face
i
sorry
that
we
meet
again
under
such
sad
circumstances
he
added
perfunctorily
i
suppose
you
think
i
meddled
enough
in
your
affairs
already
and
on
my
word
i
intended
to
stay
out
of
this
but
of
course
i
been
watching
it
in
the
papers
partly
because
it
was
interesting
and
partly
because
i
knew
you
it
struck
me
yesterday
afternoon
as
i
was
thinking
things
over
that
you
were
making
much
headway
and
might
like
a
little
help
so
i
induced
the
to
send
down
their
best
man
i
hope
i
shall
get
at
the
truth
he
paused
a
moment
and
looked
at
me
sharply
do
you
want
me
to
stay
i
will
go
back
if
you
rather
have
me
i
was
instantly
ashamed
of
my
distrust
of
the
afternoon
whatever
might
be
terry
failings
i
could
not
doubt
as
i
looked
into
his
face
that
his
irish
heart
was
in
the
right
place
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
truth
i
returned
steadily
if
you
can
discover
it
for
heaven
sake
do
so
that
what
i
paid
for
said
terry
the
does
deal
in
fiction
any
more
than
it
can
help
as
we
climbed
into
the
carriage
he
added
briskly
it
a
horrible
affair
the
details
as
i
have
them
from
the
papers
are
not
full
enough
but
you
can
tell
them
to
me
as
we
drive
along
i
should
have
laughed
had
i
been
feeling
less
anxious
his
greeting
was
so
entirely
characteristic
in
the
way
he
shuffled
through
the
necessary
condolences
and
jumped
with
such
evident
relish
to
the
gruesome
details
as
i
gathered
up
the
reins
and
backed
away
from
the
terry
broke
out
with
here
hold
on
a
minute
where
are
you
going
back
to
i
said
in
some
surprise
i
thought
you
want
to
unpack
your
things
and
get
settled
have
much
time
to
get
settled
he
laughed
i
have
an
engagement
in
new
york
the
day
after
how
about
the
cave
is
it
too
late
to
visit
it
now
well
i
said
dubiously
it
ten
miles
across
the
mountains
and
pretty
heavy
roads
it
would
be
dark
before
we
got
there
as
far
as
that
goes
we
could
visit
the
cave
at
night
as
well
as
in
the
daytime
but
i
want
to
examine
the
neighborhood
and
interview
some
of
the
people
so
i
suppose
he
added
with
an
impatient
sigh
we
have
to
wait
till
morning
and
now
where
this
young
gaylord
he
in
the
kennisburg
jail
and
where
that
about
three
miles
from
here
and
six
miles
from
the
plantation
ah
suppose
we
pay
him
a
visit
first
there
are
one
or
two
points
concerning
his
whereabouts
on
the
night
of
the
robbery
and
his
actions
on
the
day
of
the
murder
that
i
should
like
to
have
him
clear
up
i
smiled
slightly
as
i
turned
the
horses
heads
toward
kennisburg
radnor
in
his
present
uncommunicative
frame
of
mind
was
not
likely
to
afford
terry
much
satisfaction
there
is
any
time
to
waste
he
added
as
we
drove
along
just
let
me
have
your
account
of
everything
that
happened
beginning
with
the
first
appearance
of
the
ghost
i
briefly
sketched
the
situation
at
as
i
had
found
it
on
my
arrival
and
the
events
preceding
the
robbery
and
the
murder
terry
interrupted
me
once
or
twice
with
questions
he
was
particularly
interested
in
the
situation
concerning
radnor
polly
mathers
and
jim
mattison
and
i
was
as
brief
as
possible
in
my
replies
i
did
not
care
to
make
polly
the
heroine
of
a
sunday
feature
article
he
was
also
persistent
in
regard
to
jefferson
past
i
told
him
all
i
knew
added
the
story
of
my
own
suspicions
and
ended
by
producing
the
telegram
proving
his
alibi
h
said
terry
folding
it
thoughtfully
and
putting
it
in
his
pocket
it
had
occurred
to
me
too
that
jeff
might
be
our
man
this
puts
an
end
to
the
theory
that
he
personally
committed
the
murder
there
are
some
very
peculiar
points
about
this
case
he
added
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
believe
that
radnor
gaylord
is
any
more
guilty
of
the
crime
than
i
am
or
i
should
have
come
but
it
wo
do
for
me
to
jump
at
conclusions
until
i
get
more
data
i
suppose
you
realize
what
is
the
peculiarly
significant
point
about
the
murder
you
mean
mose
disappearance
well
no
i
did
have
that
in
mind
that
significant
enough
to
be
sure
but
nothing
but
what
you
would
naturally
expect
the
crime
was
committed
if
your
data
is
straight
either
by
him
or
in
his
presence
and
of
course
he
disappears
you
could
scarcely
have
expected
to
find
him
sitting
there
waiting
for
you
in
either
case
you
mean
radnor
behavior
on
the
day
of
the
murder
and
his
refusal
to
explain
it
i
asked
uneasily
no
terry
laughed
that
may
be
significant
and
it
may
not
i
strongly
suspect
that
it
is
not
what
i
mean
is
the
peculiar
place
in
which
the
crime
was
committed
no
person
on
earth
could
have
foreseen
that
colonel
gaylord
would
go
alone
into
that
cave
there
is
an
accidental
element
about
the
murder
it
must
have
been
committed
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
by
someone
who
had
not
premeditated
it
at
least
at
that
time
this
is
the
point
we
must
keep
in
mind
he
sat
for
a
few
moments
staring
at
the
dashboard
with
a
puzzled
frown
broadly
speaking
he
said
slowly
i
have
found
that
you
can
place
the
motive
of
every
wilful
murder
under
one
of
three
heads
avarice
fear
or
revenge
suppose
we
consider
the
first
could
avarice
have
been
the
motive
for
colonel
gaylord
murder
the
body
had
not
been
robbed
you
tell
me
no
we
found
a
gold
watch
and
considerable
money
in
the
pockets
then
you
see
if
the
motive
were
avarice
it
could
not
have
been
immediate
gain
that
throws
out
the
possibility
that
the
murderer
was
some
unknown
thief
who
merely
took
advantage
of
a
chance
opportunity
if
we
are
to
conceive
of
avarice
as
the
motive
the
crime
must
have
been
committed
by
some
person
who
would
benefit
more
remotely
by
the
colonel
death
did
anyone
owe
him
money
that
you
know
of
there
is
no
record
of
anything
of
the
sort
and
he
was
a
careful
business
man
i
do
not
think
he
would
have
loaned
money
without
making
some
memorandum
of
it
he
held
several
mortgages
but
they
of
course
revert
to
his
heirs
i
understood
that
radnor
was
the
only
heir
he
is
practically
there
are
a
few
minor
bequests
to
the
servants
and
to
some
old
friends
did
the
servants
know
that
anything
was
to
go
to
them
no
i
do
think
they
did
and
this
mose
did
he
receive
a
share
yes
larger
than
any
of
the
others
it
seems
that
colonel
gaylord
at
least
had
confidence
in
him
and
how
about
the
other
son
did
he
know
that
he
was
to
be
disinherited
i
think
that
the
colonel
made
it
plain
at
the
time
they
parted
terry
shook
his
head
and
frowned
this
disinheriting
business
is
bad
i
do
like
it
and
i
never
shall
it
stirs
up
more
than
anything
i
know
of
jeff
seems
to
have
proved
an
alibi
however
and
we
will
dismiss
him
for
the
present
rad
has
always
sympathized
with
jeff
i
said
then
continued
terry
if
the
servants
did
not
know
the
contents
of
the
will
and
we
have
all
of
the
data
radnor
is
the
only
one
who
could
knowingly
have
benefited
by
the
colonel
death
suppose
we
take
a
glance
at
motives
of
fear
do
you
know
of
anyone
who
had
reason
to
stand
in
fear
of
the
colonel
he
was
oppressing
anybody
no
damaging
evidence
against
any
person
in
his
possession
not
levying
blackmail
was
he
not
that
i
know
of
and
i
smiled
slightly
it
not
likely
mused
terry
but
you
never
can
tell
what
is
going
to
come
out
when
a
respectable
man
is
and
now
as
to
revenge
with
a
man
of
colonel
gaylord
character
there
were
likely
to
be
a
good
many
people
who
owed
him
a
bad
turn
he
seems
to
have
been
a
peppery
old
gentleman
it
quite
on
the
cards
that
he
had
some
enemies
among
his
neighbors
no
so
far
as
i
can
discover
he
was
very
popular
in
the
neighborhood
the
indignation
over
his
death
was
something
tremendous
when
it
first
got
out
that
rad
was
accused
of
the
crime
there
was
even
talk
of
lynching
him
so
servants
all
appeared
to
be
fond
of
him
the
old
family
servants
were
at
the
news
of
his
death
they
had
been
for
the
most
part
born
and
bred
on
the
place
and
in
spite
of
his
occasional
harshness
they
loved
the
colonel
with
the
devotion
of
the
slave
toward
his
master
he
was
in
his
way
exceedingly
kind
to
them
when
old
uncle
eben
died
my
uncle
watched
all
night
by
his
bed
it
a
queer
situation
terry
muttered
and
relapsed
into
silence
till
we
reached
the
jail
it
was
an
brick
building
set
back
from
the
street
and
shaded
by
trees
rather
more
than
the
tombs
terry
commented
should
mind
taking
a
rest
in
it
myself
we
found
radnor
pacing
up
and
down
the
small
room
in
which
he
was
confined
like
a
caged
animal
the
anxiety
and
seclusion
were
beginning
to
tell
on
his
nerves
he
faced
about
quickly
as
the
door
opened
and
at
sight
of
me
his
face
lightened
he
was
growing
pathetically
pleased
at
having
anyone
with
whom
he
could
talk
rad
i
said
with
an
air
of
cheerfulness
which
was
not
entirely
assumed
i
hope
we
nearing
the
end
of
our
trouble
at
last
this
is
patten
terry
patten
of
new
york
who
has
come
to
help
me
unravel
the
mystery
it
was
an
unfortunate
beginning
i
had
told
him
before
of
connection
with
the
affair
he
had
half
held
out
his
hand
as
i
commenced
to
speak
but
he
dropped
it
now
with
a
slight
frown
i
do
think
i
care
to
be
interviewed
he
remarked
curtly
i
have
nothing
to
say
for
the
benefit
of
the
you
better
said
terry
imperturbably
the
prints
the
truth
you
know
and
some
of
the
other
papers
do
the
truth
always
the
best
in
the
end
i
merely
want
to
find
out
what
information
you
can
give
me
in
regard
to
the
ghost
i
will
tell
you
nothing
radnor
growled
i
am
not
giving
statements
to
the
press
gaylord
said
terry
with
an
assumption
of
gentle
patience
if
you
will
excuse
my
referring
to
what
i
know
must
be
a
painful
subject
would
you
mind
telling
me
if
the
suspicion
has
ever
crossed
your
mind
that
your
brother
jefferson
may
have
returned
secretly
have
abstracted
the
bonds
from
the
safe
and
two
weeks
later
quite
accidentally
have
met
colonel
gaylord
alone
in
the
cave
radnor
turned
upon
him
in
a
sudden
fury
i
thought
for
a
moment
he
was
going
to
strike
him
and
i
sprang
forward
and
caught
his
arm
the
gaylords
may
be
a
bad
lot
but
they
are
not
liars
and
they
are
not
cowards
they
do
not
run
away
they
stand
by
the
consequences
of
their
acts
terry
bowed
gravely
just
one
more
question
and
i
am
through
what
happened
to
you
that
day
in
the
cave
it
none
of
your
damned
business
i
glanced
apprehensively
at
terry
uncertain
as
to
how
he
would
take
this
but
he
did
not
appear
to
resent
it
he
looked
radnor
over
with
an
air
of
interested
approval
and
his
smile
slowly
broadened
i
glad
to
see
you
game
he
remarked
i
tell
you
i
do
know
who
killed
my
father
any
more
than
you
do
radnor
cried
you
need
come
here
asking
me
questions
go
and
find
the
murderer
if
you
can
and
if
you
ca
hang
me
and
be
done
with
it
i
do
know
that
we
need
take
up
any
more
of
gaylord
time
said
terry
to
me
i
found
out
about
all
i
wished
to
know
we
drop
in
again
he
added
reassuringly
to
radnor
good
afternoon
as
we
went
out
of
the
door
he
turned
back
a
moment
and
added
with
a
slightly
sharp
undertone
in
his
voice
and
the
next
time
i
come
gaylord
you
shake
hands
fumbling
in
his
pocket
he
drew
out
my
telegram
from
the
police
commissioner
and
tossed
it
onto
the
cot
in
the
meantime
there
something
for
you
to
think
about
good
by
do
you
mean
i
asked
as
we
climbed
back
into
the
carriage
that
radnor
did
believe
jeff
guilty
well
not
exactly
i
fancy
he
will
be
relieved
though
to
find
that
jeff
was
three
thousand
miles
away
when
the
murder
was
committed
only
once
during
the
drive
home
did
terry
exhibit
any
interest
in
his
surroundings
and
that
was
when
we
passed
through
the
village
of
lambert
corners
he
made
me
slow
down
to
a
walk
and
explain
the
purpose
of
everyone
of
the
dozen
or
so
buildings
along
the
square
at
place
he
suddenly
decided
that
he
needed
some
stamps
and
i
waited
outside
while
he
obtained
them
together
with
a
drink
in
the
private
back
room
nothing
like
getting
the
lay
of
the
land
he
remarked
as
he
climbed
back
into
the
carriage
that
miller
is
a
picturesque
old
party
he
thinks
it
all
that
radnor
gaylord
had
anything
to
do
with
the
crime
rad
a
customer
of
his
and
it
a
downright
imposition
to
lock
the
boy
up
where
he
ca
spend
money
for
the
rest
of
the
drive
terry
kept
silence
and
i
did
not
venture
to
interrupt
it
i
had
come
to
have
a
superstitious
feeling
that
his
silences
were
portentous
it
was
not
until
i
stopped
to
open
the
gate
into
our
own
home
lane
that
he
suddenly
burst
out
with
the
question
where
do
the
mathers
people
live
a
couple
of
miles
farther
down
the
pike
they
have
no
connection
whatever
with
the
business
and
do
know
a
thing
about
it
ah
perhaps
not
would
it
be
too
late
to
drive
over
yes
said
i
it
would
oh
very
well
said
he
there
be
time
enough
in
the
morning
i
let
this
pass
without
comment
but
on
one
thing
i
was
resolved
and
that
was
that
polly
mathers
should
never
fall
into
terry
clutches
there
are
a
lot
of
questions
i
want
to
ask
about
your
ghost
but
wait
till
i
get
my
bearings
and
my
dinner
he
added
with
a
laugh
there
was
any
dining
car
on
that
train
and
i
breakfasted
early
and
omitted
lunch
here
we
are
i
said
as
we
came
in
sight
of
the
house
the
cook
is
expecting
us
so
that
is
the
gaylord
house
is
it
a
fine
old
place
when
was
it
built
about
i
imagine
let
me
see
sheridan
rode
up
the
shenandoah
valley
and
burned
everything
in
sight
how
did
this
place
happen
to
escape
i
do
know
just
how
it
did
you
see
it
a
mile
back
from
the
main
road
and
well
hidden
by
trees
i
suppose
they
were
in
a
hurry
and
it
escaped
their
attention
and
that
row
of
shanties
down
there
are
the
haunted
negro
cabins
ah
terry
rose
in
his
seat
and
scanned
them
eagerly
we
have
a
look
at
them
as
soon
as
i
get
something
to
eat
really
a
farm
is
so
bad
he
remarked
as
he
stepped
out
upon
the
portico
and
is
this
solomon
he
inquired
as
the
old
negro
came
forward
to
take
his
bag
well
solomon
i
been
reading
about
you
in
the
papers
you
and
i
are
going
to
have
a
talk
by
and
by
chapter
xvii
we
search
the
abandoned
cabins
now
said
terry
as
solomon
and
the
suitcase
disappeared
upstairs
let
you
and
i
have
a
look
at
those
haunted
cabins
i
thought
you
were
hungry
starving
but
i
still
have
strength
enough
to
get
that
far
solomon
says
supper
wo
be
ready
for
half
an
hour
and
we
have
half
an
hour
to
waste
i
due
in
the
city
the
day
after
remember
you
wo
find
anything
i
said
i
searched
every
one
of
those
cabins
myself
and
the
did
leave
a
trace
behind
him
i
think
i
just
glance
about
with
my
own
eyes
laughed
terry
reporters
sometimes
see
things
you
know
where
corporation
lawyers
do
just
as
you
please
i
replied
is
at
your
disposal
i
led
the
way
across
the
lawn
and
into
the
laurel
growth
terry
followed
with
eyes
eagerly
alert
the
gruesome
possibilities
of
the
place
appealed
to
him
he
pushed
through
the
briars
that
surrounded
the
first
cabin
and
came
out
on
the
slope
behind
where
he
stood
gazing
down
delightedly
at
the
dark
waters
of
the
fourth
pool
my
word
this
is
great
we
run
a
picture
and
call
it
the
tarn
did
know
such
places
really
existed
thought
writers
made
up
come
on
he
called
plunging
back
to
the
laurel
walk
we
must
catch
our
ghost
i
do
want
this
scenery
to
go
to
waste
we
commenced
at
the
first
cabin
and
went
down
the
row
thoroughly
and
systematically
at
terry
insistence
one
of
the
stable
men
brought
a
ladder
and
we
climbed
into
every
loft
finding
nothing
but
spiders
and
dust
the
last
on
the
left
being
more
weatherproof
than
the
others
was
used
as
a
granary
a
space
six
feet
square
was
left
inside
the
door
but
for
the
rest
the
room
was
filled
nearly
to
the
ceiling
with
sacks
of
indian
meal
how
about
this
did
you
examine
this
cabin
well
really
terry
there
is
much
room
for
a
ghost
here
ghosts
do
require
much
room
how
about
the
loft
i
did
go
up
you
ca
get
at
the
trap
without
moving
all
the
meal
i
see
terry
was
examining
the
three
walls
of
sacks
before
us
now
here
is
a
sack
rather
dirtier
than
the
rest
and
squashy
it
looks
to
me
as
if
it
had
had
a
good
deal
of
rough
handling
he
pulled
it
to
the
floor
as
he
spoke
and
another
with
it
a
space
some
three
feet
high
was
visible
by
crawling
one
could
make
his
way
along
without
hitting
the
ceiling
come
on
said
terry
scrambling
to
the
top
of
the
pile
and
pulling
me
after
him
we
struck
the
trail
of
our
ghostly
friend
unless
i
very
much
look
at
that
he
pointed
to
a
muddy
plainly
outlined
on
one
of
the
sacks
do
disturb
it
we
may
want
to
compare
it
with
the
marks
in
the
hello
what
this
the
print
of
a
bare
foot
that
our
friend
mose
he
took
out
a
pocket
rule
and
made
careful
measurements
of
both
prints
the
result
he
set
down
in
a
note
book
i
was
quite
as
excited
now
as
terry
we
crawled
along
on
all
fours
until
we
reached
the
open
trap
there
was
no
trace
here
of
either
or
dust
we
scrambled
into
the
loft
without
much
difficulty
and
found
a
large
room
with
sloping
beams
overhead
and
two
small
windows
innocent
of
glass
at
either
end
the
room
was
empty
but
clean
it
had
been
thoroughly
swept
and
recently
terry
poked
about
but
found
nothing
h
he
grunted
mose
cleaned
ah
here
we
are
he
paused
before
a
horizontal
beam
along
the
side
wall
and
pointed
to
a
little
pile
of
ashes
and
a
cigar
stub
he
smokes
cigars
and
good
strong
ones
at
least
he
is
a
lady
did
you
ever
see
a
cigar
like
that
before
yes
i
said
that
the
kind
the
colonel
always
smoked
a
fresh
box
was
stolen
from
the
cupboard
a
day
or
so
after
i
got
here
solomon
said
it
was
the
but
we
suspected
it
was
solomon
was
the
cupboard
unlocked
oh
yes
any
of
the
house
servants
could
have
got
at
it
well
said
terry
poking
his
head
from
the
windows
for
a
view
of
the
ground
beneath
that
all
there
seems
to
be
here
we
might
as
well
go
down
we
boosted
up
the
two
meal
bags
again
and
started
back
toward
the
house
terry
eyes
studied
his
surroundings
keenly
whether
for
the
sake
of
the
story
he
was
planning
to
write
or
the
mystery
he
was
trying
to
solve
i
could
only
conjecture
his
glance
presently
fixed
on
the
stables
where
old
uncle
jake
was
visible
sitting
on
an
upturned
pail
in
the
doorway
you
go
on
he
ordered
and
have
put
dinner
or
supper
or
whatever
you
call
it
on
the
table
and
i
be
back
in
three
minutes
i
want
to
see
what
that
old
fellow
over
there
has
to
say
in
regard
to
the
ghost
it
was
fifteen
minutes
later
that
terry
reappeared
well
i
inquired
as
i
led
the
way
to
the
did
you
get
any
news
of
the
ghost
did
i
the
society
for
psychical
research
ought
to
investigate
this
neighborhood
they
find
more
spirits
in
half
an
hour
than
found
in
their
whole
past
history
terry
attention
during
supper
was
chiefly
directed
toward
fried
chicken
and
beat
biscuits
when
he
did
make
any
remarks
he
addressed
them
to
solomon
rather
than
to
me
solomon
was
loquacious
enough
in
general
but
he
had
his
own
ideas
of
table
decorum
and
it
was
evident
that
the
friendly
advances
of
my
guest
considerably
scandalized
him
when
the
coffee
and
cigars
were
brought
on
terry
appeared
to
be
on
the
point
of
inviting
solomon
to
sit
down
and
have
a
cigar
with
us
but
he
thought
better
of
it
and
contented
himself
with
talking
to
the
old
man
across
my
shoulder
he
confined
his
questions
to
matters
concerning
the
household
and
the
farm
and
solomon
in
vain
endeavored
to
confine
his
replies
to
yes
sah
no
sah
jes
so
sah
in
five
minutes
he
was
well
started
and
it
would
have
required
a
to
stop
him
in
the
midst
of
it
terry
rose
and
dismissing
me
with
a
brief
i
join
you
in
the
library
later
i
want
to
talk
to
solomon
a
few
minutes
he
bowed
me
out
and
shut
the
door
i
was
amused
rather
than
annoyed
by
this
summary
dismissal
terry
had
been
in
the
house
not
quite
two
hours
and
i
am
sure
that
a
third
person
looking
on
would
have
picked
me
out
for
the
stranger
way
of
being
at
home
in
any
surroundings
was
absolutely
inimitable
had
he
ever
had
occasion
to
visit
windsor
castle
i
am
sure
that
he
would
have
set
about
immediately
making
king
edward
feel
at
home
he
appeared
in
the
library
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
with
the
apology
i
hope
you
did
mind
being
turned
out
servants
are
sometimes
embarrassed
you
know
about
telling
the
truth
before
any
of
the
family
you
did
get
much
truth
out
of
solomon
i
retorted
i
do
know
that
i
did
terry
admitted
with
a
laugh
there
are
the
elements
of
a
good
reporter
in
solomon
he
has
an
imagination
which
i
respect
the
gaylords
appear
to
be
an
interesting
family
with
hereditary
tempers
the
ghost
i
hear
beat
a
slave
to
death
and
to
pay
for
it
is
doomed
to
pace
the
laurel
walk
till
the
day
of
judgment
that
the
story
i
nodded
and
the
beating
is
at
least
authentic
h
terry
frowned
and
solomon
tells
me
tales
of
the
colonel
himself
whipping
the
negroes
there
ca
be
any
truth
in
that
but
there
is
i
said
he
did
hesitate
to
strike
them
when
he
was
angry
i
myself
saw
him
beat
a
nigger
a
few
days
ago
and
i
recounted
the
story
of
the
chicken
thief
so
a
man
of
that
sort
is
likely
to
have
enemies
he
does
suspect
how
about
mose
was
colonel
gaylord
in
the
habit
of
whipping
him
often
i
nodded
but
the
more
the
colonel
abused
mose
the
fonder
mose
appeared
to
grow
of
the
colonel
it
a
puzzling
situation
said
terry
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
with
a
thoughtful
frown
well
he
exclaimed
with
a
sudden
access
of
energy
i
suppose
we
might
as
well
sit
down
and
tackle
it
he
took
off
his
coat
and
rolled
up
his
shirt
sleeves
then
shoving
everything
back
from
one
end
of
the
big
library
table
he
settled
himself
in
a
chair
and
motioned
me
to
one
opposite
tomorrow
morning
he
said
as
he
took
out
from
his
pockets
a
roll
of
newspaper
clippings
and
a
yellow
copy
pad
we
will
drive
over
and
have
a
look
at
that
cave
it
ought
to
tell
its
own
story
but
in
the
meantime
he
looked
up
with
a
laugh
suppose
we
use
our
brains
a
little
i
did
not
resent
the
inference
terry
was
his
old
impudent
self
and
i
was
so
relieved
at
having
him
there
assuming
the
responsibility
that
he
might
have
wiped
the
floor
with
me
and
welcome
our
object
he
commenced
is
not
to
prove
your
cousin
innocent
of
the
murder
but
to
find
out
who
is
guilty
the
most
logical
method
would
be
to
study
the
scene
of
the
crime
first
but
as
that
does
not
appear
feasible
until
morning
we
will
examine
such
data
as
we
have
on
the
face
of
it
the
only
two
who
appear
to
be
implicated
are
radnor
and
this
mose
who
is
a
most
picturesque
character
terry
added
the
reporter
for
the
moment
getting
ahead
of
the
detective
he
paused
and
examined
the
end
of
his
fountain
pen
speculatively
and
then
ran
through
the
pile
of
clippings
before
him
well
now
as
for
radnor
suppose
we
look
into
his
case
a
little
he
glanced
over
one
of
the
newspaper
slips
and
tossed
it
across
to
me
there
a
clipping
from
the
censor
a
tolerably
conservative
journal
what
have
you
to
say
in
regard
to
it
i
picked
it
up
and
glanced
it
over
it
was
dated
may
four
days
after
the
murder
and
was
the
same
in
substance
as
many
other
articles
i
had
read
in
the
past
week
no
new
evidence
has
come
to
light
in
regard
to
the
sensational
murder
of
colonel
gaylord
whose
body
was
discovered
in
luray
cave
virginia
a
few
days
ago
the
authorities
now
concur
in
the
belief
that
the
crime
was
committed
by
the
son
of
the
murdered
man
the
accused
is
awaiting
trial
in
the
kennisburg
jail
it
seems
impossible
that
any
man
however
depraved
could
in
cold
blood
commit
so
brutal
and
unnatural
a
crime
as
that
with
which
radnor
gaylord
is
accused
it
is
only
in
the
light
of
his
past
history
that
the
action
can
be
understood
coming
from
one
of
the
oldest
families
of
virginia
an
heir
to
wealth
and
an
honored
name
he
is
but
another
example
of
the
many
who
have
sold
their
for
a
mess
of
pottage
a
drunkard
and
a
spendthrift
he
wasted
his
youth
in
gambling
and
betting
on
the
races
while
honest
men
were
toiling
for
their
daily
bread
several
times
has
radnor
gaylord
been
disinherited
and
turned
adrift
but
colonel
gaylord
weak
in
his
love
for
his
youngest
son
invariably
received
him
back
again
into
the
house
he
had
dishonored
finally
pressed
beyond
the
point
of
endurance
the
old
man
took
a
firm
stand
and
refused
to
meet
his
son
inordinate
demands
for
money
young
gaylord
rendered
desperate
by
debts
took
the
most
obvious
method
of
gaining
his
inheritance
his
part
in
the
tragedy
of
colonel
gaylord
death
is
as
good
as
proved
though
he
persistently
and
defiantly
denies
all
knowledge
of
the
crime
no
sympathy
can
be
felt
for
him
the
wish
of
every
man
in
the
country
must
be
that
the
law
will
take
its
course
and
that
as
speedily
as
possible
well
said
terry
as
i
finished
it
a
lie
i
cried
hotly
all
of
it
every
word
of
it
oh
see
here
said
terry
there
no
use
in
your
trying
to
hide
things
that
account
is
an
exaggeration
of
course
but
it
must
have
some
foundation
you
told
me
you
were
afraid
of
the
truth
just
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
it
to
me
then
exactly
what
sort
of
a
fellow
is
radnor
i
want
to
know
for
several
reasons
well
he
did
drink
a
good
deal
for
a
youngster
i
admitted
though
never
to
such
an
extent
as
has
been
reported
of
late
he
had
stopped
entirely
as
for
gambling
the
young
men
around
here
have
got
into
a
bad
way
of
playing
for
high
stakes
but
during
the
past
month
or
so
rad
had
pulled
up
in
that
too
he
sometimes
backed
one
of
their
own
horses
from
the
gaylord
stables
but
so
did
the
colonel
it
the
regular
thing
in
virginia
as
for
his
ever
having
been
disinherited
that
is
a
newspaper
story
pure
and
simple
i
never
heard
anything
of
the
sort
and
the
neighborhood
has
told
me
pretty
much
all
there
is
to
know
within
the
last
few
days
his
father
never
turned
him
out
of
the
house
then
never
that
i
heard
of
he
did
leave
home
once
because
his
father
insulted
him
but
he
came
back
again
that
was
forgiving
commented
terry
in
general
though
i
understand
that
the
relations
between
the
two
were
rather
strained
at
times
they
were
i
admitted
but
things
had
been
going
rather
better
for
the
last
few
days
until
the
night
before
the
murder
they
quarreled
then
and
over
a
matter
of
money
yes
radnor
makes
no
secret
of
it
he
wanted
his
father
to
settle
something
on
him
and
upon
his
father
refusal
some
words
passed
between
them
and
a
french
clock
suggested
terry
i
acknowledged
the
clock
and
terry
pondered
the
question
with
one
eye
closed
meditatively
had
radnor
ever
asked
for
anything
of
the
sort
before
not
that
i
know
of
why
did
he
ask
then
well
it
rather
galling
for
a
man
of
his
age
to
be
dependent
on
his
father
for
every
cent
he
gets
the
colonel
always
gave
him
plenty
but
he
did
not
want
to
take
it
in
that
way
in
just
what
way
did
he
want
to
take
it
terry
inquired
since
he
was
so
infernally
independent
why
did
he
get
to
work
and
earn
something
earn
something
i
returned
sharply
rad
has
managed
the
whole
plantation
for
the
last
three
years
his
father
was
getting
too
old
for
business
and
if
rad
had
taken
hold
things
would
have
gone
to
the
deuce
long
ago
all
he
got
as
a
regular
salary
was
fifty
dollars
a
month
i
think
it
was
time
he
was
paid
for
his
services
oh
very
well
terry
laughed
i
was
merely
asking
the
question
and
if
you
will
allow
me
to
go
a
step
further
why
did
colonel
gaylord
object
to
settling
something
on
the
boy
he
wanted
to
keep
him
under
his
thumb
the
colonel
liked
to
rule
and
he
wished
everyone
around
him
to
be
dependent
on
his
will
i
see
said
terry
radnor
had
a
real
grievance
then
after
all
just
one
thing
more
on
this
point
why
did
he
choose
that
particular
time
to
make
his
request
you
say
he
has
had
practical
charge
of
affairs
for
the
past
three
years
why
did
he
not
wish
to
be
independent
last
year
or
why
did
he
not
postpone
the
desire
until
next
year
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
you
have
to
ask
radnor
that
i
had
my
own
suspicions
but
i
did
not
wish
to
drag
polly
mathers
name
into
the
discussion
terry
watched
me
a
moment
without
saying
anything
and
then
he
too
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
turned
back
to
the
newspaper
clippings
i
wo
go
into
the
matter
of
radnor
connection
with
the
just
now
i
should
like
to
consider
first
his
actions
on
the
day
of
the
murder
i
have
here
a
report
of
the
testimony
taken
at
the
inquest
but
it
is
not
so
full
as
i
could
wish
in
some
particulars
i
should
like
to
have
you
give
me
the
details
first
you
say
that
radnor
and
his
father
did
not
speak
at
the
breakfast
table
how
was
it
when
you
started
they
both
appeared
to
be
in
pretty
good
spirits
but
i
noticed
that
they
avoided
each
other
very
well
tell
me
exactly
what
you
did
after
you
arrived
at
luray
we
left
our
horses
at
the
hotel
and
walked
about
a
mile
across
the
fields
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
we
had
lunch
in
the
woods
and
at
about
one
we
started
through
the
cave
we
came
out
at
a
little
after
three
and
i
should
say
started
to
drive
back
about
half
past
four
did
you
notice
radnor
through
the
day
not
particularly
did
you
see
either
him
or
the
colonel
in
the
cave
yes
i
was
with
the
colonel
most
of
the
time
and
how
about
radnor
did
you
see
him
at
all
oh
yes
i
remember
talking
to
him
once
about
some
queerly
shaped
stalagmites
he
did
hang
around
me
naturally
while
i
was
with
his
father
and
when
you
talked
to
him
about
the
stalagmites
was
there
anyone
else
with
him
at
the
time
i
believe
miss
mathers
was
there
and
he
was
carrying
her
coat
i
did
notice
at
least
he
left
it
later
in
what
you
call
the
gallery
of
the
broken
column
yes
i
see
said
terry
glancing
over
the
printed
report
of
the
inquest
that
the
coroner
asked
at
this
point
if
radnor
were
in
the
habit
of
forgetting
young
ladies
coats
that
more
pertinent
than
many
of
the
questions
he
asked
how
about
it
was
he
in
the
habit
of
forgetting
young
ladies
coats
i
really
do
know
terry
i
said
somewhat
testily
it
a
pity
you
not
more
observing
he
returned
for
important
on
the
whole
but
never
mind
i
find
that
out
for
myself
did
you
notice
when
he
left
the
rest
of
the
party
no
there
was
such
a
crowd
of
us
that
i
did
miss
him
very
well
we
have
a
look
at
his
testimony
he
left
the
rest
of
you
in
this
same
gallery
of
the
broken
column
went
straight
out
strolled
about
the
woods
for
half
an
hour
or
so
and
then
returned
to
the
hotel
i
fancy
is
not
precisely
the
right
word
but
at
any
rate
the
word
he
uses
now
that
half
hour
in
the
woods
is
an
unfortunate
circumstance
had
he
gone
directly
to
the
hotel
from
the
cave
we
could
have
proved
an
alibi
without
any
difficulty
as
it
is
he
had
plenty
of
time
after
the
others
came
out
to
remember
that
he
had
forgotten
the
coat
return
for
it
renew
the
quarrel
with
his
father
and
after
the
fatal
result
make
his
way
to
the
hotel
while
the
rest
of
the
party
were
still
loitering
in
the
woods
terry
i
began
he
waved
his
hand
in
a
gesture
of
dissent
oh
i
not
saying
that
what
happen
i
just
showing
you
that
the
district
attorney
theory
is
a
physical
possibility
let
glance
at
the
landlord
testimony
a
moment
when
radnor
returned
for
his
horse
he
appeared
angry
excited
and
in
a
hurry
those
are
the
words
and
they
are
corroborated
by
the
stable
boy
and
several
loungers
about
the
hotel
he
was
in
a
hurry
why
because
he
wished
to
get
away
before
the
others
came
back
he
had
suddenly
decided
while
he
was
in
the
woods
probably
when
he
heard
them
laughing
and
talking
as
they
came
out
of
the
cave
that
he
did
not
wish
to
see
anyone
he
was
angry
mark
that
all
of
the
witnesses
agree
there
and
i
think
that
his
actions
carry
out
their
evidence
he
drank
two
glasses
of
brandy
by
the
way
i
understood
you
to
say
he
had
stopped
drinking
he
ordered
the
stable
boy
about
sharply
he
swore
at
him
for
being
slow
he
lashed
his
horse
quite
unnecessarily
as
he
galloped
off
he
rode
home
at
an
outrageous
rate
and
he
was
not
solomon
gives
me
to
understand
in
the
habit
of
maltreating
horses
now
what
do
you
make
of
all
this
here
is
a
young
man
with
an
unexpended
lot
of
temper
on
his
hands
bent
on
being
reckless
bent
on
being
just
as
bad
as
he
can
be
it
as
clear
as
daylight
that
boy
never
committed
any
crime
a
man
who
had
just
murdered
his
father
would
not
be
filled
with
anger
no
matter
what
the
provocation
had
been
he
might
be
overcome
with
horror
fear
remorse
a
dozen
different
emotions
but
anger
would
not
be
among
them
and
further
a
man
who
had
committed
a
crime
and
intended
to
deny
it
later
would
not
proclaim
his
feelings
in
quite
that
blatant
manner
young
gaylord
had
not
injured
anyone
he
himself
had
been
injured
he
was
mad
through
and
through
and
he
did
care
who
knew
it
he
expended
you
will
remember
the
most
of
his
belligerency
on
his
horse
on
the
way
home
and
you
found
him
in
the
summer
house
undergoing
the
natural
reaction
by
evening
he
had
got
himself
well
in
hand
again
and
was
probably
considerably
ashamed
of
his
conduct
he
does
care
to
talk
about
the
matter
for
several
reasons
fortunately
solomon
is
not
so
scrupulous
i
do
know
what
you
driving
at
terry
said
i
do
you
he
inquired
well
really
it
about
time
that
i
came
down
he
paused
while
he
scrawled
one
or
two
sentences
on
his
copy
pad
then
he
glanced
up
with
a
laugh
i
do
know
myself
but
i
think
i
can
make
a
pretty
good
guess
we
call
on
miss
polly
mathers
in
the
morning
and
see
if
she
ca
help
us
out
terry
i
expostulated
that
girl
knows
no
more
about
the
matter
than
i
do
she
has
already
given
her
testimony
and
i
positively
will
not
have
her
name
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
affair
i
do
see
how
you
can
help
it
was
his
cool
reply
if
she
in
she
in
and
i
not
to
blame
however
we
wo
quarrel
about
it
now
we
pay
her
a
call
in
the
morning
he
ran
his
eyes
over
the
clippings
again
then
added
there
are
just
two
more
points
connecting
radnor
gaylord
with
the
murder
that
need
explaining
the
in
the
cave
and
the
match
box
the
i
will
dismiss
for
the
present
because
i
have
not
seen
them
myself
and
i
ca
make
any
deductions
from
hearsay
evidence
but
the
question
of
the
match
box
may
repay
a
little
investigation
i
want
you
to
tell
me
precisely
what
happened
in
the
woods
before
you
went
into
the
cave
in
the
first
place
how
many
older
people
were
there
in
the
party
and
mathers
a
lady
who
was
visiting
them
and
colonel
gaylord
there
were
two
servants
i
understand
besides
this
mose
to
help
about
the
lunch
what
did
they
do
well
i
do
know
exactly
i
was
paying
much
attention
i
believe
they
carried
things
over
from
the
hotel
collected
wood
for
the
fire
and
then
went
to
a
farm
house
for
water
but
mathers
it
seems
attended
to
lighting
the
fire
yes
she
and
the
colonel
made
the
fire
and
started
the
coffee
ah
said
terry
with
a
note
of
satisfaction
in
his
voice
the
matter
begins
to
clear
was
colonel
gaylord
in
the
habit
of
smoking
he
smoked
one
cigar
after
every
meal
never
any
more
than
that
no
the
doctor
had
limited
him
the
colonel
grumbled
about
it
regularly
and
always
smoked
the
biggest
blackest
cigar
he
could
find
and
where
did
he
get
his
matches
solomon
passed
the
brass
match
box
from
the
mantelpiece
just
as
he
passed
it
to
us
colonel
gaylord
was
not
in
the
habit
of
carrying
matches
in
his
pockets
then
no
i
think
not
we
may
safely
assume
said
terry
that
in
this
matter
of
making
the
fire
if
the
two
were
working
together
the
colonel
was
on
his
knees
arranging
the
sticks
while
mathers
was
standing
by
giving
directions
that
i
believe
is
the
usual
division
of
labor
well
then
they
get
to
the
point
of
needing
a
light
the
colonel
feels
through
his
pockets
finds
that
he
has
a
match
and
what
happens
what
did
happen
i
broke
in
was
that
mathers
turned
to
a
group
of
us
who
were
standing
talking
at
one
side
and
asked
if
any
of
us
had
a
match
and
rad
handed
her
his
box
that
is
the
last
anyone
remembers
about
it
exactly
said
terry
and
i
think
i
can
tell
you
the
rest
you
can
see
for
yourself
what
took
place
mathers
went
back
to
the
spot
where
they
were
building
the
fire
and
the
colonel
took
the
match
box
from
her
no
man
is
ever
going
to
stand
by
and
watch
a
woman
strike
a
match
he
can
do
it
so
much
better
himself
at
this
point
mathers
by
her
own
testimony
was
called
away
and
she
remember
anything
further
about
the
box
she
thinks
that
she
returned
it
why
for
no
reason
on
earth
except
that
she
usually
returns
things
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
she
did
do
it
this
time
she
was
called
away
and
the
colonel
was
left
to
light
the
fire
alone
he
recognized
the
box
as
his
son
and
he
dropped
it
into
his
pocket
at
another
time
perhaps
he
would
have
walked
over
and
handed
it
back
but
not
then
the
two
were
not
speaking
to
each
other
later
at
the
time
of
the
struggle
in
the
cave
the
box
fell
from
the
old
man
pocket
and
formed
a
most
damaging
piece
of
circumstantial
evidence
against
his
son
on
the
whole
terry
finished
i
do
not
think
we
shall
have
a
very
difficult
time
in
clearing
radnor
i
had
arrived
at
my
own
conclusions
concerning
him
from
reading
the
papers
what
extra
data
i
needed
i
managed
to
glean
from
solomon
lies
and
as
for
you
he
added
gazing
across
at
me
with
an
imperturbable
grin
i
think
you
were
wise
in
deciding
to
be
a
corporation
lawyer
chapter
xviii
terry
arrives
at
a
conclusion
and
now
said
terry
lighting
a
fresh
cigar
and
after
a
few
preliminary
puffs
settling
down
to
work
again
we
will
consider
the
case
of
mose
a
beautiful
name
by
the
way
and
apparently
a
beautiful
character
it
wo
be
my
fault
if
we
do
make
a
beautiful
story
out
of
him
you
yourself
i
believe
hold
the
opinion
that
he
committed
the
murder
i
am
sure
of
it
i
cried
in
that
case
laughed
terry
i
should
be
inclined
to
think
him
innocent
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
getting
angry
if
terry
chose
to
regard
the
solving
of
a
murder
mystery
in
the
light
of
a
joke
i
had
nothing
to
say
though
i
did
think
he
might
have
realized
that
to
me
at
least
it
was
a
serious
matter
and
you
base
your
suspicions
do
you
not
upon
the
fact
that
he
has
queer
eyes
not
entirely
upon
what
then
upon
the
fact
that
he
took
part
in
the
struggle
which
ended
in
my
uncle
death
well
certainly
that
does
seem
rather
conclusive
there
is
no
mistake
about
the
none
whatever
the
mathers
niggers
both
wore
shoes
and
anyway
they
did
go
into
the
cave
in
that
case
i
suppose
it
fair
to
assume
that
mose
took
part
in
the
struggle
whether
he
was
the
only
man
or
whether
there
was
still
a
third
the
cave
itself
ought
to
tell
a
pretty
clear
story
terry
rose
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
once
or
twice
and
then
came
back
and
picked
up
one
of
the
newspaper
clippings
it
says
here
that
the
boot
marks
of
two
different
men
are
visible
that
the
sheriff
opinion
i
replied
though
i
myself
ca
make
out
anything
but
the
marks
of
mose
and
the
colonel
i
examined
everything
carefully
but
it
awfully
mixed
up
you
know
one
really
ca
tell
much
about
it
terry
impatiently
flung
himself
into
the
chair
again
i
ought
to
have
come
down
last
week
if
i
had
supposed
you
people
could
muddle
matters
up
so
thoroughly
i
should
i
dare
say
you
trampled
the
whole
place
over
till
there
is
one
of
the
original
marks
left
look
here
terry
i
said
you
act
as
if
virginia
belonged
to
you
we
all
been
working
our
heads
off
over
this
business
and
you
come
in
at
the
last
moment
and
quarrel
with
our
data
you
can
go
over
tomorrow
morning
and
collect
your
own
evidence
if
you
think
it
so
far
superior
to
anyone
else
the
marks
are
just
as
they
were
boards
have
been
laid
over
them
and
nothing
been
disturbed
you
rather
done
up
old
man
terry
remarked
smiling
across
at
me
of
course
it
quite
on
the
cards
that
mose
committed
the
crime
but
there
are
a
number
of
objections
as
i
understand
it
he
has
the
reputation
of
being
a
harmless
peaceable
fellow
not
very
bright
but
always
he
never
resented
an
injury
was
never
known
to
quarrel
with
anyone
took
what
was
given
him
and
said
thank
you
he
loved
colonel
gaylord
and
watched
over
his
interests
as
jealously
as
a
dog
well
now
is
a
man
who
has
had
this
reputation
all
his
life
a
man
whom
everybody
trusts
very
likely
to
go
off
the
hook
as
suddenly
as
that
and
with
no
conceivable
motive
brutally
kill
the
master
he
has
served
so
faithfully
a
future
is
in
a
large
measure
determined
by
his
past
that
may
all
be
true
enough
i
said
but
it
is
very
possible
that
people
were
deceived
in
mose
i
have
been
suspicious
of
him
from
the
moment
i
laid
eyes
on
him
you
may
think
it
unfair
to
judge
a
man
from
his
physical
appearance
but
i
wish
you
could
once
see
mose
yourself
and
you
would
know
what
i
mean
the
people
around
here
are
used
to
him
and
do
notice
it
so
much
but
his
eyes
are
yellow
positively
yellow
and
they
narrow
in
the
light
just
like
a
cat
one
night
he
drove
radnor
and
me
home
from
a
party
and
i
could
actually
see
his
eyes
shining
in
the
dark
it
the
most
gruesome
thing
i
ever
saw
and
take
that
on
top
of
his
habits
he
carries
snakes
around
in
the
front
of
his
shirt
really
one
suspects
him
of
anything
i
hope
he
is
dead
terry
murmured
wistfully
i
like
a
personal
interview
he
sat
sunk
down
in
his
chair
for
several
minutes
intently
examining
the
end
of
his
fountain
pen
well
he
said
rousing
himself
it
time
we
had
a
shy
at
the
ghost
we
must
find
out
in
what
way
radnor
and
mose
were
connected
with
him
and
in
what
way
he
was
connected
with
the
robbery
radnor
could
help
us
considerably
if
he
would
only
talk
the
fact
that
he
wo
talk
is
very
suggestive
we
get
at
the
truth
without
him
though
suppose
you
begin
and
tell
me
everything
from
the
first
appearance
of
the
i
should
like
to
get
him
tabulated
the
first
definite
thing
that
reached
the
house
i
replied
was
the
night
of
my
arrival
when
the
roast
chicken
was
stolen
i
told
you
that
in
detail
and
it
was
that
same
night
that
aunt
saw
the
ghost
in
the
laurel
walk
i
nodded
did
she
say
what
it
looked
like
it
was
white
and
when
you
searched
the
cabins
did
you
go
into
the
one
where
the
grain
is
stored
no
mose
dropped
his
torch
at
the
entrance
and
anyway
rad
said
there
was
no
use
in
searching
it
it
was
already
full
to
the
brim
with
sacks
of
corn
meal
do
you
think
that
radnor
was
trying
to
divert
you
from
the
scene
no
i
am
sure
he
had
a
suspicion
himself
and
what
did
the
thing
look
like
that
you
saw
mose
carrying
to
the
cabins
in
the
night
it
seemed
to
be
a
large
black
bundle
i
have
thought
since
that
it
might
have
been
clothes
or
blankets
or
something
of
that
sort
so
much
for
the
first
night
said
terry
now
how
soon
did
the
ghost
appear
again
various
things
were
stolen
after
that
and
the
servants
attributed
it
to
the
but
the
first
direct
knowledge
i
had
was
the
night
of
the
party
when
radnor
acted
so
strangely
i
told
you
of
his
going
back
in
the
night
he
was
carrying
something
too
yes
he
had
a
black
bundle
it
might
have
been
clothes
and
after
that
he
and
mose
were
in
constant
consultation
yes
they
both
encouraged
the
belief
in
the
among
the
negroes
and
did
their
best
to
keep
everyone
away
from
the
laurel
walk
i
overheard
mose
several
times
telling
stories
to
the
other
negroes
about
the
terrible
things
the
would
do
if
it
caught
them
and
he
himself
did
show
any
fear
over
the
stories
not
the
slightest
appeared
rather
to
enjoy
them
and
radnor
how
did
he
take
the
matter
he
was
moody
and
irritable
i
could
see
that
something
was
preying
on
his
mind
how
did
you
explain
the
matter
to
yourself
i
was
afraid
he
had
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
someone
who
was
threatening
him
possibly
levying
blackmail
but
you
did
make
any
attempt
to
discover
the
truth
well
it
was
rad
own
affair
and
i
did
want
the
appearance
of
spying
i
did
keep
my
eyes
open
as
much
as
i
could
and
the
colonel
how
did
he
take
all
this
excitement
about
the
it
bothered
him
considerably
but
rad
kept
him
from
hearing
it
as
much
as
he
could
when
did
the
appear
again
after
the
party
oh
by
that
time
all
sorts
of
rumors
were
running
about
among
the
negroes
the
whole
place
was
haunted
and
several
of
the
plantation
hands
had
left
but
the
next
thing
that
we
heard
directly
was
in
the
early
evening
before
the
robbery
when
mose
appearing
terribly
frightened
said
he
had
seen
the
rising
in
a
cloud
of
blue
smoke
out
of
the
and
how
did
the
colonel
and
radnor
take
this
the
colonel
was
angry
because
he
had
been
bragging
about
mose
not
being
afraid
and
rad
was
dazed
he
did
know
what
to
think
he
hustled
mose
out
of
the
way
before
we
could
ask
any
questions
and
what
did
you
think
well
i
fancied
at
the
time
that
he
had
really
seen
something
but
as
i
thought
it
over
in
the
light
of
later
events
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
shamming
both
then
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
he
roused
the
house
that
is
you
wished
to
think
him
shamming
in
order
to
prove
his
complicity
in
the
robbery
and
the
murder
and
so
you
twisted
the
facts
to
suit
your
theory
i
do
think
you
can
say
that
i
returned
somewhat
hotly
merely
a
question
of
interpreting
the
facts
he
did
gain
much
by
raising
all
that
hullabaloo
in
the
middle
of
the
night
why
yes
that
was
done
in
order
to
throw
suspicion
on
the
oh
i
see
laughed
terry
well
now
let
get
to
the
end
of
this
matter
was
any
more
seen
of
the
after
that
night
no
at
least
not
directly
for
five
or
six
days
everyone
was
so
taken
up
with
the
robbery
that
the
excitement
rather
died
down
then
i
believe
there
were
some
rumors
among
the
negroes
but
nothing
much
reached
the
house
and
since
the
murder
nothing
whatever
has
been
seen
of
the
i
shook
my
head
just
give
me
a
list
of
the
things
that
were
stolen
well
the
roast
chicken
a
box
of
cigars
some
shirts
off
the
line
a
suit
of
rad
pajamas
a
french
novel
some
brandy
quite
a
lot
of
things
to
eat
fresh
loaves
of
bread
preserves
a
boiled
ham
sugar
coffee
oh
any
amount
of
stuff
the
niggers
simply
helped
themselves
and
laid
it
to
the
one
of
the
carriages
was
left
out
one
night
and
in
the
morning
the
cushions
were
gone
and
two
lap
robes
at
the
same
time
a
water
pail
was
taken
and
a
pair
of
jake
overalls
and
then
to
end
up
came
the
robbery
of
the
safe
the
had
catholic
tastes
any
of
the
things
turned
up
since
yes
a
number
of
things
such
as
blankets
and
clothes
and
dishes
have
gradually
drifted
back
the
carriage
cushions
and
lap
robes
ever
find
them
never
a
trace
and
why
anyone
should
want
i
do
know
what
color
were
the
lap
robes
plain
black
broadcloth
terry
got
up
and
paced
about
a
few
moments
and
then
came
back
and
sat
down
one
thing
is
clear
he
said
there
are
two
two
what
do
you
mean
just
what
i
say
suppose
for
convenience
we
call
them
number
one
and
number
two
number
one
occupied
apartments
over
the
grain
bin
and
haunted
the
laurel
walk
he
was
white
i
do
wonder
at
that
if
he
spent
much
time
crawling
over
those
flour
sacks
he
smoked
cigars
and
read
french
novels
mose
waited
on
him
and
radnor
knew
about
him
and
did
get
much
enjoyment
out
of
the
knowledge
it
took
money
to
get
rid
of
him
a
hundred
dollars
down
and
the
promise
of
more
to
come
radnor
himself
drove
him
off
in
the
carriage
the
night
he
left
and
mose
obliterated
all
traces
of
his
presence
so
much
for
number
one
as
for
number
two
he
appeared
three
or
four
days
before
the
robbery
and
haunted
pretty
much
the
whole
place
especially
the
region
of
the
in
appearance
he
was
nine
feet
tall
transparent
and
black
smoke
came
from
his
mouth
and
blue
flames
from
his
eyes
there
was
a
sulphurous
odor
about
him
he
was
first
seen
rising
out
of
the
and
there
is
a
passage
in
the
bottom
of
the
that
leads
straight
down
to
hell
solomon
is
my
authority
i
asked
him
how
he
explained
the
apparition
and
he
reckoned
it
was
the
ghost
of
the
slave
who
was
beaten
to
death
and
that
since
his
old
master
had
come
back
to
haunt
the
laurel
walk
he
had
come
back
to
haunt
his
old
master
that
sounds
to
me
like
a
plausible
explanation
as
soon
as
it
light
i
have
a
look
at
the
terry
i
said
disgustedly
that
may
make
a
very
picturesque
newspaper
story
but
it
does
help
much
in
unravelling
the
mystery
it
helps
a
good
deal
i
would
not
like
to
swear
to
the
flames
or
sulphur
or
the
passage
down
to
hell
but
the
fact
that
he
was
tall
and
black
and
comes
from
the
is
significant
he
was
black
mark
that
so
were
the
stolen
lap
robes
now
you
see
how
the
matter
stands
on
the
night
of
the
robbery
while
ghost
number
one
was
out
driving
with
radnor
ghost
number
two
entered
the
house
through
the
open
library
window
found
the
safe
ajar
and
helped
himself
let
consider
what
he
took
five
thousand
dollars
in
government
bonds
two
deeds
an
insurance
policy
and
a
quart
of
small
change
a
very
suggestive
lot
of
loot
if
you
think
about
it
enough
after
the
robbery
he
disappeared
nothing
seen
of
him
for
five
or
six
days
then
he
turned
up
again
for
a
day
or
so
and
finally
disappeared
forever
so
much
for
number
two
he
the
party
we
after
he
pretty
certainly
robbed
the
safe
and
he
possibly
committed
the
murder
as
to
that
i
wo
have
any
proof
until
i
see
the
cave
he
stretched
his
arms
with
a
laugh
oh
this
is
so
bad
all
we
got
to
do
now
is
to
identify
those
two
ghosts
i
glad
if
you
think
it
so
easy
i
said
somewhat
sullenly
but
i
will
tell
you
one
thing
if
you
go
to
basing
any
deductions
on
stories
you
find
yourself
bumping
against
a
stone
wall
we
have
rad
over
to
dinner
with
us
tomorrow
night
terry
declared
he
rose
and
pulled
out
his
watch
it
a
quarter
before
ten
i
think
it
time
you
went
to
bed
you
look
about
played
out
you
have
been
sleeping
much
of
late
no
i
ca
say
that
i
have
i
ought
to
have
come
down
at
once
said
terry
but
i
always
so
blamed
afraid
of
hurting
people
feelings
i
stared
slightly
i
had
never
considered
that
one
of
terry
weak
points
but
as
he
seemed
to
be
quite
in
earnest
i
let
the
remark
pass
do
you
think
i
could
knock
up
one
of
the
to
drive
me
to
the
village
i
know
it
pretty
late
but
i
got
to
send
a
couple
of
telegrams
telegrams
i
demanded
where
to
terry
laughed
well
i
must
send
a
word
to
the
to
the
effect
that
the
luray
mystery
grows
more
mysterious
every
hour
that
the
police
have
been
wasting
their
energies
on
the
wrong
scent
but
that
the
special
correspondent
has
arrived
on
the
scene
and
that
we
may
accordingly
look
for
a
speedy
solution
what
is
the
second
one
i
asked
to
your
friend
the
police
commissioner
of
seattle
you
do
think
that
jeff
my
dear
fellow
i
do
think
unless
i
have
facts
to
think
do
look
so
nervous
i
not
accusing
him
of
anything
i
merely
want
more
details
than
you
got
i
a
newspaper
man
remember
and
i
like
local
color
even
in
telegrams
and
now
go
to
bed
and
for
heaven
sake
go
to
sleep
the
case
is
in
the
hands
of
the
young
man
and
you
need
worry
any
more
chapter
xix
terry
finds
the
bonds
i
was
wakened
the
next
morning
by
terry
clumping
into
my
room
dressed
in
riding
breeches
and
boots
freshly
spattered
with
mud
they
were
radnor
clothes
terry
had
taken
me
at
my
word
and
was
thoroughly
at
home
hello
old
man
he
said
sitting
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
been
asleep
have
you
sorry
to
wake
you
but
we
got
a
day
work
ahead
hope
you
do
mind
my
borrowing
radnor
togs
did
come
down
prepared
for
riding
solomon
gave
to
me
seemed
to
think
that
radnor
would
need
any
more
oh
solomon
and
i
are
great
friends
he
added
with
a
laugh
as
he
suddenly
appeared
to
remember
the
object
of
his
visit
and
commenced
a
search
through
his
pockets
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
watched
him
impatiently
it
was
evident
that
he
had
some
news
and
equally
evident
that
he
was
going
to
be
as
leisurely
as
possible
about
imparting
it
this
is
a
pretty
country
he
remarked
as
he
finished
with
his
coat
pockets
and
commenced
on
the
waistcoat
it
would
be
almost
worth
living
in
if
many
little
affairs
like
this
occurred
to
keep
things
going
really
terry
i
said
when
you
refer
to
my
uncle
murder
as
a
affair
i
think
you
going
too
far
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
he
returned
i
guess
i
am
incorrigible
i
did
know
colonel
gaylord
personally
you
see
and
so
used
to
murders
that
i
come
to
think
it
the
only
natural
way
of
dying
anyhow
he
added
as
he
finally
produced
a
yellow
envelope
i
got
something
here
that
will
interest
you
it
explains
why
our
young
friend
radnor
did
want
to
talk
he
tossed
the
envelope
on
the
bed
and
i
eagerly
tore
out
the
telegram
it
was
from
the
police
commissioner
in
seattle
and
it
ran
jefferson
gaylord
returned
seattle
may
fifth
after
absence
six
weeks
said
to
have
visited
old
home
virginia
had
been
wanted
by
police
suspected
implication
in
case
obtaining
money
false
pretences
mistaken
charge
case
dismissed
what
does
it
mean
i
asked
it
means
said
terry
that
we
spotted
ghost
number
one
it
was
clear
from
the
first
that
radnor
was
trying
to
shield
someone
even
at
the
expense
of
his
own
reputation
leaving
women
out
of
the
case
that
pointed
pretty
straight
toward
his
elder
brother
part
of
your
theory
was
correct
the
only
trouble
being
that
you
carried
it
too
far
you
made
jeff
commit
both
the
robbery
and
the
murder
while
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
neither
then
when
you
found
a
part
of
your
theory
was
untenable
you
rejected
the
whole
of
it
this
is
how
the
matter
stood
jeff
gaylord
was
pretty
desperately
in
need
of
money
i
suspect
that
the
charge
against
him
whatever
it
was
was
true
the
money
he
had
taken
had
to
be
returned
and
silence
bought
before
the
thing
could
be
hushed
up
anyway
seattle
was
too
hot
to
hold
him
and
he
lit
out
and
came
east
he
applied
to
radnor
but
radnor
was
in
a
tight
place
himself
and
could
lay
his
hands
on
anything
except
what
his
father
had
given
him
for
a
birthday
present
that
was
tied
up
in
another
investment
and
if
he
converted
it
into
cash
it
would
be
at
a
sacrifice
so
it
ran
along
for
a
week
or
so
while
rad
was
casting
about
for
a
means
of
getting
his
brother
out
of
the
way
without
any
fresh
scandal
but
mose
suddenly
taking
to
seeing
precipitated
matters
realizing
that
his
father
patience
had
reached
its
limit
and
that
he
could
keep
you
off
the
scent
much
longer
he
determined
to
borrow
the
money
for
jeff
journey
back
to
seattle
and
to
close
up
his
own
investment
that
same
night
he
drove
jeff
to
the
station
at
kennisburg
the
washington
express
does
not
stop
at
lambert
junction
and
anyway
kennisburg
is
a
bigger
station
and
travellers
excite
less
comment
this
is
deduction
it
fact
i
rode
to
kennisburg
this
morning
and
proved
it
the
station
man
remembers
selling
radnor
gaylord
a
ticket
to
washington
in
the
middle
of
the
night
about
three
weeks
ago
some
man
who
waited
outside
and
whose
face
the
agent
did
not
see
boarded
the
train
and
rad
drove
off
alone
the
ticket
seller
does
not
know
rad
personally
but
he
knows
him
by
sight
so
much
for
that
rad
came
home
and
went
to
bed
when
he
came
down
stairs
in
the
morning
he
was
met
by
the
information
that
the
had
robbed
the
safe
you
can
see
what
instantly
jumped
into
his
mind
some
way
somehow
jeff
had
taken
those
bonds
and
yet
figure
on
it
as
he
might
he
could
not
see
how
it
was
possible
the
robbery
seemed
to
have
occurred
while
he
was
away
could
jeff
merely
have
pretended
to
leave
might
he
have
slipped
off
the
train
again
and
come
back
those
are
the
questions
that
were
bothering
radnor
he
was
honest
in
saying
that
he
could
not
imagine
how
the
bonds
had
been
stolen
and
yet
he
was
also
honest
in
not
wanting
to
know
the
truth
he
might
have
confided
in
me
i
said
it
would
have
been
a
good
deal
better
if
he
had
but
in
order
to
understand
rad
point
of
view
you
must
take
into
account
character
he
appears
to
have
been
a
reckless
dashing
headstrong
but
exceedingly
attractive
fellow
his
father
put
up
with
his
excesses
for
six
years
before
the
final
quarrel
mose
so
old
jake
tells
me
moped
for
months
after
his
disappearance
rad
as
a
little
fellow
worshipped
his
bad
but
charming
there
you
have
it
jeff
turns
up
again
with
a
hard
luck
story
and
mose
and
radnor
both
go
back
to
their
old
allegiance
jeff
is
in
a
bad
hole
a
fugitive
from
justice
with
the
penitentiary
waiting
for
him
he
confesses
the
whole
thing
to
radnor
extenuating
circumstances
plausibly
to
the
fore
he
has
been
dishonest
but
unintentionally
so
he
wishes
to
straighten
up
and
lead
a
respectable
life
if
he
had
say
fifteen
hundred
dollars
he
could
quash
the
indictment
against
him
he
is
radnor
brother
and
the
colonel
son
but
rad
is
to
receive
a
fortune
while
he
is
to
be
disinherited
the
money
he
asks
now
is
only
his
right
if
he
receives
it
he
will
disappear
and
trouble
rad
no
that
i
fancy
is
the
line
of
argument
our
returned
prodigal
used
anyway
he
won
rad
over
radnor
was
thinking
of
getting
married
had
plenty
of
use
for
all
the
money
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
but
he
seems
to
be
a
generous
chap
and
he
sacrificed
himself
for
obvious
reasons
jeff
wished
his
presence
kept
a
secret
and
rad
and
mose
respected
his
wishes
after
the
robbery
radnor
was
too
sick
at
the
thought
that
his
brother
may
have
betrayed
him
to
want
to
do
anything
but
hush
the
matter
up
at
the
news
of
the
murder
he
did
not
know
what
to
think
he
would
not
believe
jeff
guilty
and
yet
he
did
not
see
any
other
way
out
terry
paused
a
moment
and
leaned
forward
with
an
excited
gleam
in
his
eye
that
he
said
is
the
whole
truth
about
ghost
number
one
our
business
now
is
to
track
down
number
two
and
here
as
a
starter
are
the
missing
bonds
he
tossed
a
pile
of
mildewed
papers
on
the
bed
and
met
my
astonishment
with
a
triumphant
chuckle
it
was
true
all
five
of
the
missing
bonds
were
there
the
may
first
coupons
still
uncut
also
the
deeds
and
insurance
policy
exactly
as
they
had
left
the
safe
except
that
they
were
damp
and
i
stared
for
a
moment
too
amazed
to
speak
finally
where
did
you
find
them
i
gasped
terry
regarded
me
with
a
tantalizing
laugh
exactly
where
i
thought
i
find
them
oh
i
been
out
early
this
morning
i
saw
the
sun
rise
and
breakfasted
in
kennisburg
at
six
i
ready
for
another
breakfast
though
hurry
up
and
dress
we
got
a
day
work
before
us
i
off
to
the
stables
to
talk
with
uncle
jake
when
you
ready
for
breakfast
send
solomon
after
me
terry
i
implored
where
on
the
face
of
the
earth
did
you
find
those
bonds
at
the
mouth
of
the
passage
to
hell
said
terry
gravely
but
i
not
quite
sure
myself
who
put
them
there
mose
i
queried
eagerly
it
might
have
been
and
it
might
not
he
waved
his
hand
airily
and
withdrew
chapter
xx
polly
makes
a
confession
at
breakfast
terry
drank
two
cups
of
coffee
and
subsided
into
thought
i
could
get
no
more
from
him
on
the
subject
of
the
bonds
he
was
not
sure
himself
was
all
the
satisfaction
he
would
give
when
the
meal
was
half
over
to
solomon
dismay
he
suddenly
rose
without
noticing
a
new
dish
of
chicken
livers
that
had
just
appeared
at
his
elbow
come
on
he
said
impatiently
you
had
enough
to
eat
i
got
to
see
those
marks
while
they
still
there
i
desperately
afraid
an
earthquake
will
swallow
that
cave
before
i
get
a
chance
at
them
fifteen
minutes
later
we
were
bowling
down
the
lane
behind
the
fastest
pair
of
horses
in
the
gaylord
stables
and
through
the
prettiest
country
in
the
state
of
virginia
terry
sat
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
eyes
on
the
as
we
came
to
the
four
corners
at
the
i
reined
in
would
you
rather
go
the
short
way
over
the
mountains
by
a
very
rough
road
or
the
long
way
through
kennisburg
i
inquired
what
that
he
asked
oh
the
short
way
by
all
means
but
first
i
want
to
call
at
the
mathers
it
would
simply
be
a
waste
of
time
it
wo
take
long
and
since
radnor
wo
talk
i
got
to
get
at
the
facts
from
the
other
end
besides
i
want
to
see
polly
myself
miss
mathers
knows
nothing
about
the
matter
said
i
as
stiffly
as
possible
does
she
said
terry
she
knows
a
good
many
things
and
it
about
time
she
told
at
any
rate
you
must
admit
that
she
the
owner
of
the
unfortunate
coat
that
caused
the
trouble
i
want
to
ask
her
some
questions
about
that
why
ca
girls
learn
to
carry
their
own
coats
it
would
save
a
lot
of
trouble
it
ended
by
my
driving
with
a
very
bad
grace
to
mathers
hall
you
wait
here
until
i
come
out
said
terry
coolly
as
i
drew
up
by
the
stepping
stone
and
commenced
fumbling
for
a
hitching
strap
not
much
said
i
if
you
interview
polly
mathers
i
shall
be
present
at
the
interview
oh
very
well
he
returned
resignedly
if
you
let
me
go
about
it
my
own
way
though
i
get
twice
as
much
out
of
her
the
family
were
at
breakfast
the
servant
informed
me
i
left
terry
in
the
parlor
while
i
went
on
to
the
to
explain
the
object
of
our
visit
there
is
a
friend
of
mine
here
from
new
york
to
help
us
about
the
trial
i
thought
it
best
to
suppress
his
real
profession
and
he
wants
to
interview
miss
polly
in
regard
to
the
coat
i
am
very
sorry
certainly
said
mathers
polly
is
only
too
glad
to
help
in
any
way
possible
and
to
my
chagrin
polly
excused
herself
and
withdrew
to
the
parlor
while
her
father
kept
me
listening
to
a
new
and
not
very
valuable
theory
of
his
in
regard
to
the
disappearance
of
mose
it
was
fifteen
minutes
before
i
made
my
escape
and
knocked
on
the
parlor
door
i
turned
the
knob
and
went
in
without
waiting
for
a
summons
the
mathers
parlor
is
a
long
cool
dim
room
with
mahogany
furniture
and
jars
of
roses
scattered
about
it
was
so
dark
after
the
bright
sunshine
of
the
rest
of
the
house
that
for
a
moment
i
discover
the
occupants
until
the
sound
of
polly
sobbing
proclaimed
their
whereabouts
i
was
somewhat
taken
aback
to
find
her
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
big
horsehair
sofa
her
head
buried
in
the
cushions
while
terry
nonchalantly
leaning
back
in
his
chair
regarded
her
with
much
the
expression
that
he
might
have
worn
at
a
first
night
at
the
theatre
it
might
also
be
noted
that
polly
wore
a
white
dress
with
a
big
bunch
of
roses
in
her
belt
that
her
hair
was
becomingly
rumpled
by
the
cushion
and
that
she
was
not
crying
hard
enough
to
make
her
eyes
red
hello
old
man
said
terry
and
i
fancied
that
his
tone
was
not
entirely
cordial
just
sit
down
and
listen
to
this
we
been
having
some
interesting
disclosures
polly
raised
her
head
and
cast
him
a
reproachful
glance
while
with
a
limp
wave
of
the
hand
she
indicated
a
chair
i
settled
myself
and
inquired
reassuringly
well
polly
what
the
trouble
you
tell
him
said
polly
to
terry
as
she
settled
herself
to
cry
again
i
tell
you
said
terry
glancing
warily
at
me
but
it
a
secret
remember
you
must
let
any
of
those
horrid
newspaper
men
get
hold
of
it
miss
mathers
would
hate
awfully
to
have
anything
like
this
get
into
the
papers
oh
go
on
terry
said
i
crossly
if
you
got
anything
to
tell
for
heaven
sake
tell
it
well
as
far
as
we
got
when
you
interrupted
was
that
that
afternoon
in
the
cave
she
and
radnor
had
somehow
got
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
party
and
gone
on
ahead
they
sat
down
to
wait
for
the
others
on
the
fallen
column
and
while
they
were
waiting
radnor
asked
her
to
marry
him
for
the
seventh
or
was
it
the
eighth
time
the
seventh
i
think
said
polly
it
happened
so
often
that
she
sort
of
lost
track
but
anyway
she
replied
by
asking
him
if
he
knew
the
truth
about
the
ghost
he
said
yes
he
did
but
he
could
tell
her
it
was
somebody
else
secret
on
his
word
of
honor
though
there
was
nothing
that
he
was
to
blame
for
she
said
she
would
marry
a
man
who
had
secrets
he
said
that
unless
she
took
him
now
she
would
never
have
the
chance
again
it
was
the
last
time
he
was
going
to
ask
her
is
that
straight
miss
mathers
sobbed
polly
from
the
depths
of
her
cushion
terry
proceeded
with
a
fast
broadening
smile
it
was
evident
that
he
enjoyed
the
recital
and
then
being
naturally
angry
that
any
man
should
presume
to
propose
for
the
last
time
she
proceeded
to
be
horrid
to
go
on
miss
mathers
that
as
far
as
you
got
i
i
told
him
you
wo
tell
anyone
no
i
told
him
i
decided
to
marry
jim
mattison
ah
said
terry
now
we
getting
at
it
if
you
do
mind
my
asking
miss
mathers
was
that
just
a
bluff
on
your
part
or
had
mattison
really
asked
you
polly
sat
up
and
eyed
him
with
a
sparkle
of
resentment
certainly
he
asked
me
a
dozen
times
i
beg
pardon
murmured
terry
so
now
you
engaged
to
mr
mattison
oh
no
cried
polly
jim
does
know
i
said
it
i
did
mean
it
i
just
wanted
to
make
radnor
mad
i
see
so
it
was
a
bluff
after
all
were
you
successful
in
making
him
mad
she
nodded
dismally
what
did
he
say
oh
he
was
awfully
angry
he
said
that
if
he
never
amounted
to
anything
it
would
be
my
fault
and
then
what
we
heard
the
others
coming
and
he
started
off
i
called
after
him
and
asked
him
where
he
was
going
and
he
said
he
was
going
to
the
d
devil
polly
began
to
cry
again
and
terry
chuckled
slightly
as
a
good
many
other
young
men
have
said
under
similar
circumstances
but
where
he
did
go
was
to
the
hotel
and
there
it
appears
he
drank
two
glasses
of
brandy
and
swore
at
the
stable
is
that
all
miss
mathers
yes
it
the
last
time
i
ever
saw
him
and
he
thinks
i
engaged
to
jim
mattison
see
here
polly
said
i
with
some
excusable
heat
now
why
in
thunder
did
you
tell
me
all
this
before
you
did
ask
me
she
was
afraid
that
it
would
get
into
the
papers
said
terry
soothingly
it
would
be
a
terrible
scandal
to
have
anything
like
that
get
out
the
fact
that
radnor
gaylord
was
likely
to
be
hanged
for
a
murder
he
never
committed
was
in
comparison
a
minor
affair
polly
turned
upon
him
with
a
flash
of
gray
eyes
i
was
going
to
tell
before
the
trial
i
did
know
the
inquest
made
any
difference
i
would
have
told
the
coroner
the
morning
he
came
to
take
my
testimony
only
he
brought
jim
mattison
with
him
as
a
witness
and
i
could
explain
before
jim
that
would
have
been
awkward
terry
agreed
polly
said
i
severely
this
is
inexcusable
if
you
had
explained
to
me
in
the
first
place
the
jury
would
never
have
remanded
radnor
for
trial
but
i
thought
you
would
find
the
real
murderer
and
then
radnor
would
be
set
free
it
would
be
awful
to
tell
that
story
before
a
whole
room
full
of
people
and
have
jim
mattison
hear
it
i
detest
jim
mattison
be
careful
what
you
say
said
terry
you
may
have
to
take
jim
mattison
after
all
radnor
gaylord
will
never
ask
you
again
then
i
ask
him
said
polly
terry
laughed
and
rose
he
in
a
bad
hole
miss
mathers
but
i
not
sure
but
that
i
envy
him
after
all
polly
dimpled
through
her
tears
this
was
the
language
she
understood
good
by
she
said
you
remember
your
promise
never
a
syllable
will
i
breathe
said
terry
and
he
put
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
marched
me
off
she
a
fascinating
young
person
he
observed
as
we
turned
into
the
road
you
are
not
the
first
to
discover
that
said
i
i
fancy
i
not
he
retorted
with
a
sidewise
glance
at
me
terry
gazed
at
the
landscape
a
few
moments
with
a
pensive
light
in
his
eyes
then
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
thank
heaven
women
do
go
in
for
crime
to
any
great
extent
never
safe
in
forming
any
theory
about
their
motives
and
their
actions
do
match
he
paused
to
light
a
cigar
and
as
soon
as
he
got
it
well
started
took
up
the
conversation
again
it
just
as
i
suspected
in
regard
to
rad
though
i
will
say
the
papers
furnished
mighty
few
clues
it
was
the
coat
that
put
me
on
the
track
coupled
with
his
behavior
at
the
hotel
you
see
his
emotions
when
he
came
out
of
that
cave
were
mixed
there
was
probably
a
good
deal
of
disappointment
and
grief
down
below
his
anger
but
that
for
the
moment
was
decidedly
in
the
lead
he
had
been
badly
treated
and
he
knew
it
what
more
he
did
care
who
else
knew
it
he
was
in
a
thoroughly
vicious
mood
and
ready
to
wreak
his
anger
on
the
first
thing
that
came
to
hand
that
happened
to
be
his
horse
by
the
time
he
got
home
he
had
expended
the
most
of
his
temper
and
his
disappointment
had
come
to
the
top
you
found
him
wrestling
with
that
by
evening
he
had
brought
his
philosophy
into
play
and
had
probably
decided
to
brace
up
and
try
again
and
that
he
finished
is
the
whole
story
of
our
young
gentleman
erratic
behavior
i
wonder
i
did
think
of
it
myself
i
said
terry
smiled
and
said
nothing
radnor
is
naturally
not
loquacious
about
the
matter
he
resumed
presently
for
one
thing
because
he
does
not
wish
to
drag
polly
name
into
it
for
another
i
suppose
he
feels
that
if
anyone
is
to
do
the
explaining
she
ought
to
be
the
one
he
supposed
that
she
would
be
present
at
the
inquest
and
that
her
testimony
would
bring
out
sufficient
facts
to
clear
him
when
he
found
that
she
was
not
there
and
that
her
testimony
did
not
touch
on
any
important
phase
of
the
matter
he
simply
shut
his
mouth
and
said
well
if
she
wo
tell
i
wo
also
the
coroner
manner
was
unfortunate
he
showed
that
his
sympathy
was
on
the
other
side
and
radnor
stubbornly
determined
not
to
say
one
word
more
than
was
dragged
out
of
him
by
main
force
it
is
much
the
attitude
of
the
little
boy
who
has
been
unfairly
punished
and
who
derives
an
immense
amount
of
satisfaction
from
the
thought
of
how
sorry
his
friends
will
be
when
he
is
dead
and
now
i
think
we
have
rad
case
well
in
hand
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
seems
bound
to
be
hung
we
shall
not
have
much
difficulty
in
getting
him
off
but
what
i
ca
understand
i
grumbled
is
why
that
little
wretch
did
tell
me
a
word
of
all
this
she
came
and
informed
me
that
he
was
innocent
and
asked
me
to
clear
him
with
never
a
hint
that
she
could
explain
the
most
suspicious
circumstance
against
him
you
got
me
terry
laughed
i
give
up
when
it
comes
to
finding
out
why
women
do
things
if
you
had
her
you
know
she
would
have
told
you
but
you
never
said
a
word
about
it
how
could
i
ask
her
when
i
did
know
anything
about
it
i
managed
to
ask
her
said
terry
and
what
more
he
added
gloomily
i
promised
it
should
go
any
further
that
is
than
is
necessary
to
get
rad
off
now
do
you
call
that
pretty
tough
luck
after
coming
down
here
just
to
find
out
the
truth
not
to
be
allowed
to
print
it
when
i
got
it
how
in
the
deuce
am
i
to
account
for
rad
behavior
without
mentioning
her
you
need
have
promised
i
suggested
oh
well
terry
grinned
i
human
i
let
this
pass
and
he
added
hastily
we
disposed
of
jeff
disposed
of
radnor
but
the
real
murderer
is
still
to
be
found
and
that
i
declared
is
mose
it
possible
agreed
terry
with
a
shrug
but
i
have
just
the
tiniest
little
entering
wedge
of
a
suspicion
that
the
real
murderer
is
not
mose
chapter
xxi
terence
kirkwood
patten
of
new
york
there
is
luray
i
said
pointing
with
my
whip
to
the
scattered
houses
of
the
village
as
they
lay
in
the
valley
at
our
feet
terry
stretched
out
a
hand
and
pulled
the
horses
to
a
standstill
whoa
just
a
minute
till
i
get
my
bearings
now
in
which
direction
is
the
cave
it
extends
all
along
underneath
us
the
entrance
is
over
there
in
the
undergrowth
about
a
mile
to
the
east
and
the
woods
extend
straight
across
the
mountain
in
an
unbroken
line
pretty
much
so
there
are
a
few
farms
scattered
in
how
about
the
farmers
are
they
around
here
i
think
on
the
whole
they
are
which
do
they
employ
mostly
to
work
in
the
fields
negroes
or
white
men
as
to
that
i
ca
say
it
depends
largely
on
circumstances
i
think
the
smaller
farms
are
more
likely
to
employ
white
men
let
me
see
said
terry
this
is
just
about
planting
time
are
the
farmers
likely
to
take
on
extra
men
at
this
season
no
i
do
think
so
harvest
time
is
when
they
are
more
likely
to
need
help
farming
is
new
to
me
laughed
terry
east
side
problems
do
involve
it
a
man
of
mose
habits
could
hide
pretty
effectually
in
those
woods
if
he
chose
he
scanned
the
hills
again
and
then
brought
his
eyes
back
to
the
village
i
suppose
we
might
as
well
go
on
to
the
hotel
first
i
should
like
to
interview
some
of
the
people
there
and
by
the
way
he
added
it
as
well
not
to
let
them
know
i
a
friend
of
yours
or
a
newspaper
man
either
i
think
i
be
a
detective
your
young
man
from
washington
seems
to
have
made
quite
a
stir
in
regard
to
the
robbery
we
see
if
i
ca
beat
him
there
nothing
that
so
impresses
a
rural
population
as
a
detective
they
look
upon
him
as
omnipotent
and
omniscient
and
every
man
squirms
before
him
in
the
fear
that
his
own
little
sins
will
be
brought
to
light
terry
laughed
in
prospect
introduce
me
as
a
detective
by
all
means
anything
you
like
i
laughed
in
return
i
introduce
you
as
the
pope
if
you
think
it
will
do
any
good
there
was
no
keeping
terry
suppressed
and
his
exuberance
was
contagious
i
was
beginning
to
feel
myself
the
hotel
at
luray
was
a
long
rambling
structure
which
had
been
casually
added
to
from
time
to
time
it
was
painted
a
sickly
mustard
yellow
a
color
which
the
landlord
assured
me
would
last
forever
but
brilliancy
was
somewhat
toned
by
a
thick
coating
of
dust
a
veranda
extended
across
the
front
of
the
building
flush
with
the
wooden
the
veranda
was
furnished
with
a
railing
and
the
railing
was
furnished
at
all
times
of
the
day
except
for
a
brief
nooning
from
twelve
to
with
a
line
of
in
assorted
sizes
we
drew
up
with
a
flourish
before
the
wooden
steps
in
front
of
the
hotel
and
i
threw
the
lines
to
the
stable
boy
who
came
forward
to
receive
us
with
an
amusing
air
of
importance
his
connection
with
the
luray
tragedy
conferred
a
halo
of
distinction
and
he
realized
the
fact
it
was
not
every
one
in
the
neighborhood
who
had
had
the
honor
of
being
cursed
by
a
murderer
as
we
alighted
terry
stopped
to
ask
him
a
few
questions
the
boy
had
told
his
story
to
so
many
credulous
audiences
that
by
this
time
it
was
unrecognizable
as
he
repeated
it
now
for
terry
benefit
the
evidence
against
radnor
appeared
conclusive
a
full
confession
of
guilt
could
scarcely
have
been
more
damning
terry
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
take
care
young
man
he
warned
you
be
eating
your
words
one
of
these
days
and
some
of
them
will
be
pretty
hard
to
swallow
as
we
mounted
the
steps
i
nodded
to
several
of
the
men
whom
i
remembered
having
seen
before
and
they
returned
an
interested
pleasant
day
as
they
cast
a
reconnoitering
glance
at
my
companion
gentlemen
i
said
with
a
wave
of
my
hand
toward
terry
let
me
introduce
terence
kirkwood
patten
the
detective
of
new
york
who
has
come
down
to
look
into
this
matter
for
us
the
chairs
which
were
tipped
back
against
the
wall
came
down
with
a
thud
and
an
awed
and
somewhat
uneasy
shuffling
of
feet
ensued
i
wish
to
go
through
the
cave
terry
remarked
in
the
crisp
incisive
tones
a
detective
might
be
supposed
to
employ
and
i
should
like
to
have
the
same
guide
who
conducted
crosby
the
time
the
body
was
discovered
that
pete
moser
he
out
in
the
back
lot
plowin
a
half
dozen
voices
responded
ah
thank
you
will
some
one
kindly
call
him
we
will
wait
here
terry
proceeded
with
his
usual
ease
to
make
himself
at
home
he
tipped
back
his
hat
inclined
his
chair
at
the
same
dubious
angle
as
the
others
and
ranged
his
feet
along
the
railing
he
produced
cigars
from
various
pockets
and
the
atmosphere
became
less
strained
they
were
beginning
to
realize
that
detectives
are
made
of
the
same
flesh
and
blood
as
other
people
i
gave
terry
the
lead
perhaps
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
he
took
it
but
it
did
not
strike
me
that
he
set
about
his
interviewing
in
a
very
manner
he
did
not
so
much
as
refer
to
the
case
we
had
come
to
investigate
but
chatted
along
pleasantly
about
the
weather
and
the
crops
and
the
difficulty
of
finding
we
had
not
been
settled
very
long
when
to
my
surprise
jim
mattison
strolled
out
from
the
what
he
was
doing
in
luray
i
could
easily
conjecture
mattison
assumption
of
interest
in
the
case
all
along
had
angered
me
beyond
measure
it
is
not
ordinarily
a
part
of
the
sheriff
duties
to
assist
the
prosecution
in
making
out
a
case
against
one
of
his
prisoners
and
owing
to
the
peculiar
relation
he
bore
to
radnor
his
interference
was
not
only
bad
law
but
excruciatingly
bad
taste
my
dislike
of
the
man
had
grown
to
such
an
extent
that
i
could
barely
be
civil
to
him
it
was
only
because
it
was
policy
on
my
part
not
to
make
him
an
active
enemy
that
i
tolerated
his
presence
at
all
i
presented
terry
though
mattison
took
his
calling
more
calmly
than
the
others
still
i
caught
several
sidewise
glances
in
his
direction
and
i
think
he
was
impressed
happy
to
know
you
patten
he
remarked
as
he
helped
himself
to
a
chair
and
settled
it
at
the
general
angle
this
is
a
pretty
mysterious
case
in
some
respects
i
rode
over
myself
this
morning
to
look
into
a
few
points
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
some
help
though
i
afraid
we
not
find
anything
that
please
you
anything
pleases
me
so
long
as
it
the
truth
terry
threw
off
as
he
studied
the
sheriff
with
a
gleam
of
amusement
in
his
eyes
he
was
thinking
i
knew
of
polly
mathers
i
hope
he
added
assuming
a
severely
professional
tone
that
you
have
let
a
lot
of
people
crowd
into
the
cave
and
tramp
up
all
the
marks
the
landlord
who
was
standing
in
the
doorway
chuckled
at
this
there
ai
many
people
that
you
could
drive
into
that
there
cave
at
the
point
of
the
pistol
he
assured
us
they
think
it
haunted
leastways
the
niggers
do
have
niggers
been
in
the
habit
of
going
in
much
oh
more
or
less
the
sheriff
returned
when
they
want
to
make
themselves
inconspicuous
for
any
reason
i
had
a
horse
thief
hide
in
there
for
two
weeks
last
year
while
we
were
scouring
the
country
for
him
there
are
so
many
little
holes
it
almost
impossible
to
find
a
man
tramps
occasionally
spend
the
night
there
in
cold
weather
do
you
have
many
tramps
around
here
not
a
great
many
once
in
a
while
a
nigger
comes
along
and
asks
for
something
to
eat
more
often
he
takes
it
without
asking
one
of
the
men
broke
in
a
week
or
so
ago
my
ole
woman
had
a
cheese
an
a
ham
an
two
whole
pies
that
she
got
ready
for
a
church
social
just
disappear
without
a
word
out
o
the
pantry
winder
if
that
ai
the
mark
of
a
nigger
i
miss
my
guess
terry
laughed
if
that
happened
in
the
north
we
should
look
around
the
neighborhood
for
a
sick
small
boy
it
was
no
boy
this
time
leastways
not
a
very
small
one
the
man
affirmed
for
that
same
day
a
pair
o
my
boots
that
i
left
in
the
wood
house
just
naturally
walked
off
by
theirselves
an
i
found
the
next
day
at
the
bottom
o
the
pasture
it
would
take
a
pretty
sizeable
fellow
that
my
boots
was
too
small
for
he
finished
with
a
grin
they
a
trifle
conspicuous
one
of
the
others
agreed
with
his
eyes
on
the
feet
in
question
i
caught
an
interested
look
in
terry
glance
as
he
mentally
took
their
measure
and
i
wondered
what
he
was
up
to
but
as
our
messenger
and
pete
moser
appeared
around
the
corner
at
the
moment
i
had
no
time
for
speculation
terry
let
his
chair
slip
with
a
bang
and
rose
to
his
feet
ah
moser
i
glad
to
see
you
he
exclaimed
with
an
air
of
relief
it
getting
late
he
added
looking
at
his
watch
and
i
must
get
this
business
settled
as
soon
as
possible
i
have
another
little
affair
waiting
for
me
in
new
york
bring
plenty
of
calcium
light
please
we
want
to
see
what
we
doing
as
the
four
of
us
were
preparing
to
start
terry
paused
on
the
top
step
and
nodded
pleasantly
to
the
group
on
the
veranda
thank
you
for
your
information
gentlemen
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
it
will
be
of
the
greatest
importance
and
he
turned
away
with
a
laugh
at
their
puzzled
faces
the
sheriff
and
i
were
equally
puzzled
i
should
have
suspected
that
terry
in
the
r√¥le
of
detective
was
playing
a
joke
on
them
had
he
not
very
evidently
got
something
on
his
mind
he
was
of
a
sudden
in
a
frenzy
of
impatience
to
reach
the
cave
and
he
kept
well
ahead
of
us
most
of
the
way
i
suppose
said
mattison
as
he
climbed
a
fence
with
tantalizing
deliberation
we
were
going
by
way
of
the
fields
as
that
was
shorter
i
suppose
that
you
are
trying
to
prove
that
radnor
gaylord
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
murder
that
will
be
easy
enough
terry
threw
back
over
his
shoulder
i
dropped
long
ago
the
one
i
after
now
is
the
real
murderer
mattison
scowled
slightly
if
you
can
explain
what
it
was
that
happened
in
that
cave
that
upset
him
so
mightily
i
come
a
little
nearer
to
believing
you
terry
laughed
and
fell
back
beside
him
it
a
thing
which
i
imagine
may
have
happened
to
one
or
two
other
young
men
of
this
neighborhood
not
inconceivably
yourself
included
mattison
seeing
no
meaning
in
this
sally
preserved
a
sulky
silence
and
terry
added
the
thing
for
us
to
do
now
is
to
bend
all
our
energies
toward
finding
mose
i
doubt
if
we
can
completely
explain
the
mystery
until
he
is
discovered
and
that
said
the
sheriff
will
be
never
you
may
mark
my
words
whoever
killed
the
colonel
killed
mose
too
it
possible
said
terry
with
an
air
of
sadness
but
i
hope
not
i
came
all
the
way
down
from
new
york
on
purpose
to
see
mose
and
i
should
hate
to
miss
him
chapter
xxii
the
discovery
of
mose
having
lighted
our
candles
we
descended
into
the
cave
and
set
out
along
the
path
i
now
knew
so
well
when
we
reached
the
pool
the
guide
lit
a
calcium
light
which
threw
a
fierce
white
glare
over
the
little
body
of
water
and
the
limestone
cliffs
and
even
penetrated
to
the
stalactite
draped
roof
far
above
our
heads
for
a
moment
we
stood
blinking
our
eyes
scarcely
able
to
see
so
sudden
was
the
change
from
the
of
our
four
flickering
candles
then
terry
stepped
forward
show
me
where
you
found
the
body
and
point
out
the
spot
where
the
struggle
took
place
he
spoke
in
quick
eager
tones
so
excited
that
he
almost
stuttered
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
act
the
part
of
detective
any
longer
he
had
forgotten
that
he
ever
was
a
reporter
he
had
forgotten
almost
that
he
was
a
human
being
from
where
we
stood
we
pointed
out
the
place
above
the
pool
where
the
struggle
had
occurred
the
spot
under
the
cliff
where
the
body
had
lain
and
the
jagged
piece
of
rock
on
which
we
had
found
the
coat
moser
even
laid
down
upon
the
ground
and
spread
out
his
arms
in
the
position
in
which
we
had
discovered
the
colonel
body
very
well
i
see
said
terry
now
the
rest
of
you
stay
back
there
on
the
boards
i
do
want
you
to
make
a
mark
he
stepped
forward
carefully
to
the
edge
of
the
water
and
bent
over
to
examine
the
soft
yellow
clay
which
formed
the
border
of
the
pool
on
the
lower
side
instantly
he
straightened
up
with
a
sharp
exclamation
of
surprise
did
any
negroes
come
in
with
you
to
recover
the
body
he
asked
no
returned
the
sheriff
as
old
man
tompkins
said
you
could
hire
a
nigger
to
stick
his
head
in
here
after
the
colonel
was
found
they
say
they
can
hear
something
wailing
around
the
pool
and
they
think
his
ghost
is
haunting
it
they
can
hear
something
wailing
can
they
terry
repeated
queerly
well
i
begin
to
believe
they
can
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
he
demanded
facing
around
at
us
how
do
you
account
for
these
peculiar
what
prints
i
asked
as
we
all
pressed
forward
at
the
moment
the
calcium
light
with
a
final
flare
died
out
and
we
were
left
again
in
the
flickering
candle
light
which
seemed
darkness
to
us
now
quick
touch
off
another
calcium
said
terry
with
suppressed
impatience
he
laid
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
my
arm
ached
from
the
tightness
of
his
grip
there
he
said
pointing
with
his
finger
as
the
light
flared
up
again
what
do
you
make
of
those
i
bent
over
and
plainly
traced
the
prints
of
bare
feet
going
and
coming
and
one
another
just
as
an
animal
would
make
in
pacing
a
cage
i
shivered
slightly
it
was
a
terribly
uncanny
sight
well
said
terry
sharply
the
place
was
beginning
to
get
on
his
nerves
too
terry
i
said
uneasily
i
never
saw
them
before
i
thought
i
examined
everything
thoroughly
but
i
was
so
excited
i
suppose
what
did
you
make
of
them
he
interrupted
whirling
about
on
mattison
who
was
looking
over
our
shoulders
i
i
did
see
them
mattison
stammered
for
heaven
sake
men
said
terry
impatiently
do
you
mean
they
were
there
or
you
did
notice
them
the
sheriff
and
i
looked
at
each
other
blankly
and
neither
answered
terry
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
frowning
down
at
the
marks
while
the
rest
of
us
waited
silently
scarcely
daring
to
think
finally
he
turned
away
without
saying
a
word
and
motioning
us
to
keep
back
commenced
examining
the
path
which
led
up
the
incline
he
mounted
the
three
stone
steps
and
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
slowly
advanced
to
the
spot
where
the
struggle
had
taken
place
how
tall
a
man
did
you
say
mose
was
he
called
down
to
us
little
short
fellow
not
more
than
five
feet
high
returned
the
sheriff
terry
took
his
ruler
from
his
pocket
and
bent
over
to
study
the
marks
at
the
scene
of
the
struggle
he
straightened
up
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
now
i
want
you
men
to
look
carefully
at
those
marks
on
the
lower
borders
of
the
pool
and
then
come
up
here
and
look
at
these
come
along
up
in
single
file
please
and
keep
to
the
middle
of
the
path
he
spoke
in
the
tone
of
one
giving
a
demonstration
before
a
kindergarten
class
we
obeyed
him
silently
and
ranged
in
a
row
along
the
boards
come
here
he
said
bend
over
where
you
can
see
now
look
at
those
marks
do
you
see
anything
different
in
them
from
the
marks
below
the
sheriff
and
i
gazed
intently
at
the
prints
of
bare
feet
which
marked
the
entire
vicinity
of
the
struggle
we
had
both
examined
them
more
than
once
before
and
we
saw
nothing
now
but
what
had
already
appeared
we
straightened
up
and
shook
our
heads
they
the
prints
of
bare
feet
said
mattison
stolidly
but
i
see
that
they
any
different
from
any
other
bare
feet
terry
handed
him
the
ruler
measure
them
he
said
measure
this
one
that
flat
on
the
ground
now
go
down
and
measure
one
of
those
prints
by
the
borders
of
the
pool
mattison
took
the
ruler
and
complied
as
he
bent
over
the
marks
on
the
lower
border
we
could
see
by
the
light
of
his
candle
the
look
of
astonishment
that
sprang
into
his
face
well
what
do
you
find
terry
asked
the
marks
up
there
are
nearly
two
inches
longer
and
an
inch
broader
exactly
terry
i
said
you
ca
blame
us
for
not
finding
that
out
we
examined
everything
when
we
took
away
the
body
and
those
marks
below
were
simply
not
there
someone
has
been
in
since
so
i
conclude
now
mattison
he
added
to
the
sheriff
come
here
and
show
me
the
marks
of
radnor
gaylord
riding
boots
mattison
returned
and
pointed
out
the
mark
which
he
had
produced
at
the
inquest
but
his
assurance
i
noticed
was
somewhat
shaken
that
said
terry
half
contemptuously
is
the
mark
of
colonel
gaylord
you
must
remember
that
he
was
struggling
with
his
assailant
he
did
not
plant
his
foot
squarely
every
time
sometimes
we
have
only
the
heel
mark
sometimes
only
the
toe
in
this
case
we
have
more
than
the
mark
of
the
whole
foot
how
do
i
account
for
it
simply
enough
the
foot
slipped
sideways
the
mark
is
you
see
exactly
the
same
in
length
as
the
others
but
disproportionately
broad
at
the
heel
and
toe
it
is
smudged
and
on
the
inside
where
the
weight
was
thrown
it
is
heavier
than
on
the
outside
the
thing
is
easy
enough
to
understand
you
ought
to
have
been
able
to
deduce
it
for
yourselves
and
besides
how
did
you
account
for
the
fact
that
there
was
only
one
mark
a
man
engaged
in
a
struggle
must
have
left
more
than
that
behind
him
no
it
is
quite
clear
at
this
point
on
the
edge
of
the
bank
there
was
no
third
person
we
are
dealing
with
only
two
men
colonel
gaylord
and
his
murderer
and
the
murderer
was
mose
i
asked
no
said
terry
patiently
not
mose
then
who
that
remains
to
be
seen
i
will
follow
him
up
and
find
out
where
he
comes
from
terry
held
his
candle
close
to
the
ground
and
followed
along
the
path
at
the
entrance
to
the
little
gallery
of
the
broken
column
it
diverged
one
part
leading
into
the
gallery
and
the
other
into
a
sort
of
blind
alley
at
one
side
terry
paused
at
the
opening
give
me
some
more
calcium
light
he
called
to
the
guide
i
want
to
look
into
this
passage
and
just
hand
me
some
of
those
boards
he
added
it
very
necessary
that
we
keep
the
marks
clear
the
rest
of
us
stood
in
a
huddled
group
on
the
one
or
two
boards
he
had
left
us
and
watched
him
curiously
as
he
made
his
way
down
the
passage
he
paused
at
the
end
and
examined
the
ground
we
saw
him
stoop
and
pick
up
something
then
he
rose
quickly
with
a
cry
of
triumph
and
came
running
back
to
us
holding
his
hands
behind
him
it
just
as
i
suspected
he
said
his
eyes
shining
with
excitement
colonel
gaylord
had
an
enemy
he
did
not
know
what
do
you
mean
we
asked
crowding
around
here
the
proof
and
he
held
out
towards
us
a
well
gnawed
ham
bone
in
one
hand
and
a
cheese
rind
in
the
other
these
were
the
provisions
intended
for
the
church
social
the
pies
i
fancy
have
disappeared
we
stared
at
him
a
moment
in
silent
wonder
the
sheriff
was
the
first
to
assert
himself
what
have
these
to
do
with
the
crime
he
asked
viewing
the
trophies
with
an
air
of
disgust
everything
the
man
who
stole
those
is
the
man
who
robbed
the
safe
and
who
murdered
colonel
gaylord
the
sheriff
uttered
a
low
laugh
of
incredulity
and
the
guide
and
i
stared
and
what
more
i
will
tell
you
what
he
looks
like
he
is
a
large
very
black
negro
something
over
six
feet
tall
when
last
seen
he
was
dressed
in
a
blue
and
white
checked
blouse
and
ragged
overalls
his
shoes
were
much
the
worse
for
wear
and
have
since
been
thrown
away
he
was
at
the
time
he
committed
the
crime
in
short
terry
added
he
is
the
chicken
thief
whom
colonel
gaylord
whipped
a
couple
of
days
before
he
died
and
he
briefly
repeated
the
incident
i
had
told
him
you
mean
i
asked
that
he
was
the
yes
said
terry
he
was
the
second
he
has
been
hiding
for
two
or
three
weeks
in
the
at
keeping
hidden
during
the
day
and
coming
out
at
night
to
prowl
around
and
steal
whatever
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
he
doubtless
deserved
punishment
but
that
fact
would
not
make
him
the
less
bitter
over
the
colonel
beating
when
i
heard
that
story
i
said
to
myself
is
a
man
who
would
be
ready
for
revenge
if
chance
put
the
opportunity
in
his
way
but
i
expostulated
how
did
he
happen
to
be
in
the
cave
as
to
that
i
can
not
say
after
the
colonel
beating
he
probably
did
not
dare
to
hang
about
any
longer
he
took
to
the
woods
and
came
in
this
direction
being
engaged
in
petty
thieving
about
the
neighborhood
it
was
necessary
to
find
a
hiding
place
during
the
daytime
and
the
cave
was
his
most
natural
refuge
we
know
that
he
is
not
afraid
of
the
dark
the
at
is
about
as
dismal
a
place
as
a
man
could
find
he
established
himself
in
this
passage
in
order
to
be
near
the
water
see
here
in
the
corner
are
drops
of
candle
grease
and
the
remains
of
a
fire
on
the
day
of
the
mathers
picnic
he
doubtless
saw
the
party
pass
through
and
recognized
colonel
gaylord
it
brought
to
his
mind
the
thrashing
he
had
received
while
he
was
still
brooding
over
the
matter
the
colonel
came
back
alone
and
it
flashed
into
the
fellow
mind
that
this
was
his
chance
he
may
have
been
afraid
at
first
or
he
may
have
hesitated
through
kindlier
motives
at
any
rate
he
did
not
attack
the
colonel
immediately
but
retreated
into
the
passage
and
the
old
man
passed
him
without
seeing
him
and
went
on
into
the
gallery
and
got
the
coat
in
the
meantime
the
negro
had
made
up
his
mind
and
as
the
colonel
came
back
he
crept
along
behind
him
it
is
hard
to
trace
the
marks
for
another
man
has
walked
over
them
since
but
see
in
this
place
at
the
edge
of
the
path
there
the
mark
of
a
palm
showing
where
the
assassin
hand
rested
when
he
crouched
on
the
ground
he
sprang
upon
the
old
man
from
the
rear
and
they
struggled
together
over
the
water
touch
off
a
light
please
you
see
how
the
clay
is
all
trampled
over
on
both
sides
of
the
path
out
to
the
brink
of
the
pool
there
is
no
second
set
of
marks
here
to
obliterate
it
we
are
dealing
with
just
two
people
colonel
gaylord
and
his
assassin
terry
bent
low
and
picked
up
from
a
crevice
what
looked
like
a
piece
of
stone
covered
with
clay
here
you
see
is
the
end
of
the
colonel
candle
he
probably
dropped
it
when
the
man
first
sprang
and
in
the
darkness
he
could
not
tell
who
or
what
had
attacked
him
in
his
frenzy
to
have
a
light
he
snatched
out
his
match
box
radnor
box
and
that
too
was
dropped
in
the
scuffle
now
even
if
the
original
motive
of
the
crime
were
not
robbery
but
revenge
as
i
fancy
it
was
at
any
rate
the
murderer
being
a
tramp
and
a
thief
would
have
robbed
the
body
but
he
did
not
why
was
that
because
he
saw
or
heard
something
that
frightened
him
and
what
could
that
have
been
but
mose
running
to
his
master
assistance
terry
strode
over
to
the
steps
which
led
to
the
incline
and
motioning
us
to
follow
pointed
out
some
marks
on
the
sloping
bank
at
the
side
of
the
path
see
here
are
mose
tracks
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
could
not
wait
to
come
up
by
the
steps
he
tried
to
take
a
cross
cut
he
scrambled
up
the
slippery
bank
so
fast
that
he
fell
on
his
hands
and
knees
in
this
place
and
slid
back
that
accounts
for
those
long
dragging
marks
which
none
of
you
appear
to
have
noticed
mose
did
his
best
but
he
could
not
reach
his
master
in
time
the
murderer
seeing
or
rather
hearing
him
for
it
must
have
been
dark
was
seized
with
sudden
fear
and
with
a
convulsive
effort
he
threw
the
old
man
against
the
rock
wall
here
where
his
head
struck
on
this
broken
stalactite
if
you
look
carefully
you
can
see
the
marks
of
blood
he
then
hurled
him
into
the
pool
and
fled
it
sounds
plausible
enough
said
the
sheriff
slowly
but
there
are
one
or
two
points
which
i
afraid
will
not
bear
examining
suppose
your
man
did
thrown
the
colonel
into
the
water
and
run
for
it
then
what
i
should
like
to
know
has
become
of
mose
that
said
terry
knitting
his
brows
is
still
a
mystery
and
a
fairly
deep
one
there
is
something
uncommonly
strange
about
those
tracks
on
the
lower
borders
of
the
pool
and
i
confess
they
puzzle
me
only
one
explanation
occurs
to
me
now
and
that
is
not
pleasant
to
think
of
we
have
some
clues
to
work
with
however
and
we
ought
not
to
be
long
in
getting
at
the
truth
if
i
had
had
your
chance
of
examining
the
cave
on
the
day
of
the
crime
he
added
i
think
i
should
know
you
might
and
again
you
might
not
said
mattison
it
easy
enough
for
you
fellows
to
come
down
here
and
make
up
a
story
about
a
lot
of
people
you
never
seen
but
i
tell
you
one
thing
and
that
is
that
you
not
so
likely
to
hit
the
truth
as
the
men
who
been
brought
up
in
the
country
in
the
first
place
it
comes
natural
to
niggers
to
be
whipped
and
they
do
mind
it
in
the
second
place
if
your
tramp
want
to
take
it
out
on
the
colonel
why
should
he
be
scared
by
mose
who
was
a
little
bit
of
a
cuss
that
i
could
lick
with
one
hand
tied
behind
me
you
may
be
able
to
impress
a
new
york
jury
with
a
ham
bone
and
a
cheese
rind
patten
but
i
can
tell
you
sir
that
a
virginia
jury
wants
witnesses
we
shall
do
our
best
to
provide
some
said
terry
coolly
and
perhaps
you
can
tell
added
mattison
with
the
triumphant
air
of
clinching
the
matter
what
has
become
of
the
five
thousand
dollars
in
bonds
you
can
never
make
me
believe
that
any
nigger
oh
they
back
in
the
safe
at
i
found
this
morning
in
the
where
the
man
had
thrown
them
now
gentlemen
he
added
with
a
touch
of
impatience
i
want
to
try
a
little
experiment
before
we
leave
the
cave
will
you
all
please
put
out
your
lights
i
want
to
see
how
dark
it
really
is
in
here
we
blew
out
our
candles
and
stood
a
moment
in
silence
at
first
all
was
black
around
us
but
as
our
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
darkness
we
saw
that
a
faint
light
filtered
in
from
somewhere
in
the
roof
above
our
heads
we
could
make
out
the
pale
blur
of
the
white
rock
wall
on
one
side
and
the
merest
glimmer
of
the
pool
below
no
terry
began
he
could
have
seen
nothing
he
must
have
he
broke
off
suddenly
and
gripping
my
arm
whispered
out
what
that
where
i
asked
up
there
straight
ahead
i
looked
up
and
saw
two
round
eyes
which
glittered
like
a
wild
beast
staring
at
us
out
of
the
darkness
a
cold
chill
ran
up
my
back
and
i
instinctively
huddled
closer
to
the
others
for
a
moment
no
one
spoke
and
i
heard
the
click
of
terry
revolver
as
he
cocked
it
then
it
suddenly
came
over
me
what
it
was
and
i
cried
out
it
mose
good
lord
he
can
see
in
the
dark
strike
a
light
some
one
terry
said
huskily
the
sheriff
struck
a
match
we
lit
our
candles
with
trembling
hands
and
pressed
forward
in
a
body
to
the
spot
where
the
eyes
had
appeared
crouched
in
a
corner
of
a
little
recess
half
way
up
the
irregular
wall
we
found
mose
shivering
with
fear
and
looking
down
at
us
with
dumb
animal
eyes
we
had
to
drag
him
out
by
main
force
the
poor
fellow
was
nearly
famished
and
so
weak
he
could
scarcely
stand
what
little
sense
he
had
ever
possessed
seemed
to
have
left
him
and
he
jabbered
in
a
tongue
that
was
scarcely
english
we
bolstered
him
up
with
a
few
drops
of
whisky
from
mattison
flask
and
half
carried
him
out
into
the
light
the
guide
ran
ahead
to
get
a
carriage
spreading
the
news
as
he
ran
that
mose
had
been
found
half
the
town
of
luray
came
out
to
the
cave
to
escort
us
back
and
i
think
the
feeling
of
regret
was
general
in
that
there
had
not
been
time
enough
to
collect
a
brass
band
chapter
xxiii
mose
tells
his
story
we
took
mose
back
to
the
hotel
shut
out
the
crowd
and
gave
him
something
to
eat
he
was
quite
out
of
his
head
and
it
was
only
by
dint
of
the
most
patient
questioning
that
we
finally
got
his
story
it
was
in
substance
as
terry
had
sketched
it
in
the
cave
in
obedience
to
my
request
mose
had
gone
back
after
the
coat
not
knowing
that
the
colonel
was
before
him
suddenly
as
he
came
near
the
pool
he
heard
a
scream
and
looked
up
in
time
to
see
a
big
negro
the
one
my
uncle
had
struck
with
his
crop
spring
upon
the
colonel
with
the
cry
it
my
now
cunnel
gaylord
you
whup
me
an
i
let
you
see
what
it
feels
like
the
colonel
turned
and
clinched
with
his
assailant
and
in
the
struggle
the
light
was
dropped
mose
with
a
cry
ran
forward
to
his
assistance
but
when
the
negro
saw
him
climbing
up
the
bank
he
suddenly
screamed
and
hurling
the
old
man
from
him
turned
and
fled
the
fellow
must
have
taken
him
for
the
devil
when
he
saw
those
eyes
and
i
do
wonder
terry
interpolated
at
this
point
after
the
colonel
murder
it
seems
that
mose
crazed
by
grief
and
fear
had
watched
us
carry
the
body
away
and
then
had
stayed
by
the
spot
where
his
master
had
died
this
accounted
for
the
marks
on
the
border
of
the
pool
knowing
all
of
the
intricate
passages
and
hiding
places
as
he
did
it
had
been
an
easy
matter
for
him
to
evade
the
party
that
had
searched
for
his
body
he
ate
the
food
the
murderer
had
left
but
this
being
exhausted
he
would
i
have
a
doubt
have
died
there
himself
with
the
unreasoning
faithfulness
of
a
dog
when
he
finished
his
rambling
and
in
some
places
scarcely
intelligible
account
we
sat
for
a
moment
with
our
eyes
upon
his
face
fascinated
by
his
look
every
bit
of
repugnance
i
had
ever
felt
toward
him
had
vanished
and
there
was
left
in
its
place
only
a
sense
of
pity
cheeks
were
hollow
his
features
sharper
than
ever
and
his
face
was
almost
pale
from
underneath
his
straight
black
matted
hair
his
eyes
glittered
feverishly
and
their
expression
of
uncomprehending
anguish
was
pitiful
to
see
he
seemed
like
a
dumb
animal
that
has
come
into
contact
with
death
for
the
first
time
and
asks
the
reason
terry
took
his
eyes
from
mose
face
and
looked
down
at
the
table
with
a
set
jaw
i
do
not
think
that
he
was
deriving
as
much
pleasure
from
the
sight
as
he
had
expected
we
all
of
us
experienced
a
feeling
of
relief
when
the
doctor
appeared
at
the
door
we
turned
mose
over
to
him
with
instructions
to
do
what
he
could
for
the
poor
fellow
and
to
take
him
back
to
as
the
door
shut
behind
them
the
sheriff
said
with
a
sigh
i
thought
this
business
proves
one
thing
it
never
safe
to
lynch
a
man
until
you
are
sure
of
the
facts
it
proves
another
thing
said
terry
dryly
which
is
a
thing
you
people
do
seem
to
have
grasped
and
that
is
that
negroes
are
human
beings
and
have
feelings
like
the
rest
of
us
poor
old
colonel
gaylord
paid
a
terrible
price
for
not
having
learned
it
earlier
in
life
we
pondered
this
in
silence
for
a
moment
then
the
sheriff
voiced
a
feeling
which
to
a
slight
extent
had
been
lurking
in
the
background
of
my
own
consciousness
in
spite
of
my
relief
at
the
d√©nouement
it
kind
of
disappointing
when
you
got
your
mind
worked
up
to
something
big
to
find
in
the
end
that
there
was
nothing
but
a
chance
nigger
at
the
bottom
of
all
that
mystery
seems
sort
of
a
terry
eyed
him
with
an
air
of
grim
humor
then
he
leaned
across
the
table
and
spoke
with
a
ring
of
conviction
that
carried
his
message
home
you
are
mistaken
mattison
the
murderer
of
colonel
gaylord
was
not
a
chance
nigger
there
was
no
chance
about
it
colonel
gaylord
killed
himself
he
committed
suicide
as
truly
as
if
he
had
blown
out
his
brains
with
a
gun
he
did
it
with
his
uncontrollable
temper
the
man
was
an
egoist
he
has
always
looked
upon
his
own
desires
and
feelings
as
of
supreme
importance
he
has
tried
to
crush
the
life
and
spirit
and
independence
from
everyone
about
him
but
once
too
often
he
wreaked
his
anger
upon
an
innocent
person
at
least
upon
a
person
that
for
all
he
knew
was
innocent
and
at
one
stroke
his
past
injustices
were
avenged
it
was
not
chance
that
killed
colonel
gaylord
it
was
the
inevitable
law
of
cause
and
effect
back
in
his
boyhood
when
he
gave
way
to
his
first
fit
of
passion
he
sentenced
himself
to
some
such
end
as
this
every
unjust
act
in
his
piled
up
the
score
against
him
oh
i
seen
it
a
hundred
times
it
character
that
tells
i
seen
it
happen
to
a
political
boss
a
man
whose
business
it
was
to
make
friends
with
every
voter
high
and
low
i
seen
him
forget
just
once
and
turn
on
a
man
humiliate
him
wound
his
pride
crush
him
under
foot
and
think
no
more
of
the
matter
than
if
he
had
stepped
on
a
worm
and
i
seen
that
man
the
most
insignificant
of
the
followers
work
and
plot
and
scheme
to
overthrow
him
and
in
the
end
succeed
the
big
man
never
knew
what
struck
him
he
thought
it
was
luck
chance
a
turn
of
the
wheel
he
never
dreamed
that
it
was
his
own
character
hitting
back
i
seen
it
so
often
i
a
fatalist
i
believe
in
chance
it
was
colonel
gaylord
who
killed
himself
and
he
commenced
it
fifty
years
ago
it
god
own
truth
terry
i
said
solemnly
the
sheriff
had
listened
to
terry
words
with
an
anxiously
reminiscent
air
i
wondered
if
he
were
reviewing
his
own
political
past
to
see
if
by
chance
he
also
had
unwittingly
crushed
a
worm
he
raised
his
eyes
to
terry
face
with
a
gleam
of
admiration
you
been
pretty
clever
patten
in
finding
out
the
truth
about
this
crime
he
acknowledged
generously
but
you
could
have
expected
me
to
find
out
he
added
for
i
did
know
any
of
the
circumstances
i
had
never
even
heard
that
such
a
man
existed
as
that
chicken
thief
and
as
to
there
being
two
ghosts
instead
of
one
there
was
a
suggestion
of
it
brought
out
at
the
inquest
terry
looked
at
him
with
his
usual
slowly
broadening
smile
he
opened
his
mouth
to
say
something
but
he
changed
his
mind
and
with
a
visible
effort
shut
it
again
terry
i
asked
how
you
find
out
about
the
chicken
thief
i
confess
i
do
understand
it
yet
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
laughed
nothing
simpler
the
trouble
with
you
people
was
that
you
were
searching
for
something
lurid
and
the
little
things
which
in
a
case
like
this
are
the
most
suggestive
you
overlooked
as
soon
as
i
read
the
story
of
the
crime
in
the
papers
i
saw
that
in
all
probability
rad
was
innocent
his
behavior
was
far
too
suspicious
for
him
really
to
be
guilty
unless
he
were
a
fool
he
would
have
covered
up
his
tracks
there
was
of
course
the
possibility
that
mose
had
committed
the
murder
but
in
the
light
of
his
past
devotion
to
the
colonel
it
did
not
seem
likely
i
had
already
been
reading
a
lot
of
sensational
stuff
about
the
ghost
of
and
when
the
murder
followed
so
close
on
the
heels
of
the
robbery
i
commenced
to
look
about
for
a
connecting
link
it
was
evident
that
radnor
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
whether
or
not
he
suspected
someone
was
not
so
clear
his
reticence
in
regard
to
the
made
me
think
that
he
did
i
came
south
with
pretty
strong
suspicions
against
the
elder
son
but
with
a
mind
still
open
to
conviction
the
telegram
showing
that
he
was
in
seattle
at
the
time
of
the
murder
proved
his
innocence
of
that
but
he
might
still
be
connected
with
the
i
tried
the
suggestion
on
radnor
and
his
manner
of
taking
it
proved
pretty
conclusively
that
i
had
stumbled
on
the
truth
the
business
i
dare
say
was
started
as
a
joke
and
was
kept
up
as
being
a
convenient
method
of
warding
off
eavesdroppers
why
jefferson
came
back
and
why
radnor
gave
him
money
are
not
matters
that
concern
us
if
they
prefer
to
keep
it
a
secret
that
their
own
affair
jeff
helped
himself
pretty
freely
to
cigars
roast
chickens
jam
pajamas
books
brandy
and
anything
else
he
needed
to
make
himself
comfortable
in
the
cabin
but
he
took
nothing
of
any
great
value
in
the
meantime
though
other
things
commenced
disappearing
things
that
radnor
knew
his
brother
had
no
use
for
and
he
supposed
the
workers
about
the
place
were
stealing
and
laying
it
to
the
ghost
as
a
convenient
scapegoat
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
not
a
second
ghost
had
appeared
on
the
scene
this
tramp
negro
had
taken
up
his
quarters
in
the
and
was
prowling
about
at
night
seeking
what
he
might
devour
he
ran
across
jeff
dressed
in
a
sheet
and
decided
to
do
some
masquerading
on
his
own
account
sheets
were
no
longer
left
on
the
line
all
night
so
he
had
to
put
up
with
lap
robes
as
a
result
the
shortly
became
haunted
by
a
jet
black
spirit
nine
feet
tall
with
blue
flames
and
sulphur
and
all
the
other
accessories
this
made
little
impression
at
the
house
until
mose
himself
was
frightened
then
radnor
saw
that
the
hoax
had
reached
the
point
where
it
was
no
longer
funny
and
he
determined
to
get
rid
of
jeff
immediately
while
he
drove
him
to
the
station
he
left
mose
behind
to
straighten
up
the
loft
and
mose
coming
into
the
house
to
put
some
things
away
met
ghost
number
two
just
after
he
had
robbed
the
safe
if
mose
eyes
looked
as
they
did
i
fancy
the
fright
was
mutual
the
ghost
in
his
excitement
dropped
one
package
of
papers
but
bolted
with
the
rest
he
made
for
his
lair
in
the
and
examined
his
booty
the
bonds
were
no
more
than
old
paper
he
tossed
them
aside
but
the
pennies
and
pieces
were
real
he
lit
out
for
the
village
with
them
the
robbery
was
not
discovered
till
morning
and
by
that
time
the
fellow
was
at
place
on
his
way
toward
being
the
drunkest
nigger
in
the
county
he
stayed
at
the
corners
a
week
or
so
until
the
money
was
gone
then
he
came
back
to
the
but
he
made
the
mistake
of
venturing
out
by
daylight
the
caught
him
and
took
him
to
the
colonel
and
you
know
the
rest
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
story
of
the
beating
i
decided
to
follow
it
up
and
when
i
heard
of
a
jet
black
spirit
rising
from
the
i
decided
to
follow
that
up
too
at
daylight
this
morning
i
routed
out
one
of
the
and
we
went
down
and
examined
the
at
least
i
examined
it
while
he
stood
outside
and
shivered
it
yielded
an
even
bigger
find
than
i
had
hoped
for
chucked
off
in
a
corner
and
trampled
with
mud
i
found
the
bonds
a
pile
of
clothing
and
carriage
cushions
formed
a
bed
there
were
the
remains
of
several
fires
and
of
a
great
many
chickens
the
whole
place
was
strewn
with
feathers
and
bones
he
had
evidently
raided
the
roosts
more
than
once
when
i
finished
with
the
it
still
lacked
something
of
six
and
i
rode
over
to
the
village
hoping
to
get
an
answer
to
my
telegram
i
wanted
to
get
jeff
case
settled
store
was
not
open
but
place
was
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
got
on
the
track
of
my
man
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
i
had
him
accounted
for
up
to
the
time
of
the
thrashing
after
that
i
could
only
conjecture
he
had
not
appeared
in
the
village
again
the
supposition
was
that
he
had
taken
to
the
woods
now
he
might
or
he
might
not
have
come
in
the
direction
of
luray
all
the
facts
i
had
to
go
upon
were
a
man
of
criminal
proclivities
who
owed
colonel
gaylord
a
grudge
and
who
was
used
to
hiding
in
caves
it
was
pure
supposition
that
he
had
come
in
this
direction
and
it
had
to
be
checked
at
every
point
by
fact
i
mention
my
suspicions
because
there
was
no
use
in
raising
false
hopes
and
because
well
you
wanted
to
be
dramatic
i
suggested
oh
yes
certainly
that
my
business
well
anyway
i
felt
i
was
getting
warm
and
i
came
over
here
this
morning
with
my
eyes
open
ready
to
see
what
there
was
to
see
the
first
thing
i
unearthed
was
this
story
of
the
church
social
provisions
there
had
then
been
a
thief
of
some
sort
in
the
neighborhood
just
at
the
time
of
colonel
gaylord
murder
the
further
theft
of
the
boots
fitted
very
neatly
into
the
theory
if
the
fellow
had
been
tramping
for
a
couple
of
days
his
shoes
already
worn
had
given
out
and
been
discarded
the
new
ones
as
we
know
were
too
small
he
left
them
at
the
bottom
of
the
pasture
and
went
the
marks
therefore
in
the
cave
which
everyone
ascribed
to
mose
were
in
all
probability
not
the
marks
of
mose
at
all
actual
investigation
proved
that
to
be
the
case
the
rest
i
think
you
know
the
mystery
has
turned
out
to
be
a
very
simple
affair
as
most
mysteries
unfortunately
do
i
reckon
you
a
pretty
good
detective
patten
said
mattison
with
a
shade
of
envy
in
his
voice
terry
bowed
his
thanks
and
laughed
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
returned
i
am
not
a
detective
of
any
sort
at
least
not
officially
i
merely
assume
the
part
once
in
a
while
when
there
seems
to
be
a
demand
officially
he
added
i
am
the
representative
of
the
new
york
a
paper
which
you
may
know
has
solved
a
good
many
mysteries
before
now
in
this
case
the
will
of
course
take
the
credit
but
it
wants
a
little
more
than
that
it
wants
to
be
the
only
paper
tomorrow
morning
to
print
the
true
details
we
four
are
the
only
ones
who
know
them
i
should
perhaps
have
been
a
little
more
circumspect
and
kept
the
facts
to
myself
but
i
knew
that
i
could
trust
you
his
eye
dwelt
upon
the
sheriff
a
moment
and
then
wandered
to
pete
moser
who
had
sat
silently
listening
throughout
the
colloquy
would
it
be
too
much
terry
inquired
to
ask
you
to
keep
silent
until
tomorrow
morning
you
can
trust
me
to
keep
quiet
said
mattison
holding
out
his
hand
me
too
said
moser
i
reckon
i
can
make
up
something
that
satisfy
the
boys
about
as
well
as
the
real
thing
thank
you
terry
said
i
guess
you
can
all
right
there
does
seem
to
be
anything
the
matter
with
your
imaginations
down
here
and
now
said
mattison
rising
i
suppose
the
first
thing
is
to
see
about
radnor
release
though
i
swear
i
do
know
yet
what
was
the
matter
with
him
on
the
day
of
the
crime
i
believe
you
have
the
honor
of
miss
polly
mathers
acquaintance
perhaps
she
will
enlighten
you
suggested
terry
a
look
of
illumination
flashed
over
mattison
face
terry
laughed
and
rose
i
have
a
reason
for
suspecting
that
miss
mathers
has
changed
her
mind
and
if
it
is
not
too
irregular
i
should
like
by
way
of
payment
to
drive
her
to
the
kennisburg
jail
myself
and
let
her
be
the
first
to
tell
him
i
want
to
give
her
a
reason
for
remembering
me
chapter
xxiv
polly
makes
a
proposal
i
was
dropped
in
kennisburg
to
attend
to
the
legal
formalities
respecting
radnor
release
while
terry
appropriated
the
horses
and
drove
to
mathers
hall
his
last
word
to
mattison
and
me
was
not
to
let
a
whisper
reach
radnor
ear
as
to
the
outcome
of
the
investigation
he
wanted
a
spectacular
d√©nouement
the
sheriff
assented
very
soberly
the
truth
had
at
last
forced
itself
upon
him
that
his
chances
with
polly
were
over
terry
reappeared
two
hours
later
with
a
very
excited
young
woman
beside
him
they
joined
us
in
the
bare
little
parlor
of
the
jail
and
if
mattison
needed
any
further
proof
that
the
end
had
come
greeting
furnished
it
an
embarrassed
flush
rose
to
her
face
as
she
saw
him
but
she
shook
hands
in
a
studiously
impersonal
way
and
asked
immediately
for
radnor
mattison
met
the
situation
with
a
dignity
i
had
scarcely
expected
he
called
a
deputy
and
turned
us
over
to
him
and
with
the
remark
that
his
services
were
happily
no
longer
needed
he
bowed
himself
out
i
saw
him
two
minutes
later
recklessly
galloping
down
the
street
polly
eyes
also
followed
the
rider
and
for
a
second
i
detected
a
shade
of
remorse
as
we
climbed
the
stairs
terry
fell
back
and
whispered
to
me
i
tell
you
i
laid
down
the
law
coming
over
we
see
if
she
game
as
the
door
of
the
cell
was
thrown
open
rad
raised
his
head
and
regarded
us
with
a
look
of
bewildered
astonishment
polly
walked
straight
in
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
radnor
she
said
you
told
me
you
would
never
ask
me
again
to
marry
you
did
you
really
mean
it
rad
still
stared
confusedly
from
her
to
terry
and
me
well
polly
sighed
if
you
did
mean
it
then
i
suppose
i
have
to
ask
you
will
you
marry
me
radnor
i
laid
a
hand
on
terry
arm
and
backed
him
much
against
his
will
into
the
corridor
jove
you
do
suppose
he
going
to
refuse
her
he
inquired
in
a
stage
whisper
no
such
luck
i
laughed
we
took
a
couple
of
turns
up
and
down
the
corridor
and
cautiously
presented
ourselves
in
the
doorway
polly
was
telling
between
laughing
and
crying
the
story
of
mose
discovery
radnor
came
to
meet
us
his
left
arm
still
around
polly
his
right
hand
extended
to
terry
will
you
shake
hands
patten
he
asked
i
afraid
i
was
very
decent
but
you
know
oh
that
no
matter
said
terry
easily
i
was
holding
it
up
against
you
but
i
hope
you
realize
gaylord
that
it
owing
to
me
you
won
miss
mathers
she
never
would
have
got
up
the
courage
to
ask
you
if
yes
i
should
flashed
polly
i
wanted
him
too
much
ever
to
let
him
slip
through
my
fingers
again
terry
boast
came
true
and
radnor
dined
at
plantation
that
night
the
news
of
his
release
had
in
some
way
preceded
us
and
as
we
drove
up
to
the
house
all
the
negroes
came
crowding
out
on
the
portico
to
welcome
home
young
marse
rad
but
the
one
person
who
whatever
the
circumstances
had
always
been
first
to
welcome
him
back
was
missing
and
the
poor
boy
felt
his
a
very
barren
festival
terry
was
steadfast
in
the
assertion
that
he
had
an
engagement
in
new
york
the
next
day
and
as
soon
as
supper
was
over
i
drove
him
to
the
station
he
was
in
an
ecstatically
frame
of
mind
do
you
know
i
a
pretty
fellow
he
observed
in
a
burst
of
confidence
i
always
known
better
than
the
proprietor
how
the
paper
ought
to
be
run
and
i
can
give
the
police
points
about
detective
work
i
something
of
a
cook
and
i
can
play
the
like
paderewski
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
tried
my
hand
at
matchmaking
and
it
comes
as
easy
as
a
murder
mystery
you
think
that
their
engagement
is
due
to
you
but
is
it
if
it
were
for
me
they
have
it
all
to
go
over
again
from
the
beginning
and
there
no
telling
how
long
they
take
about
it
i
hope
they
appreciate
your
services
terry
you
so
modest
that
what
you
do
is
in
danger
of
being
overlooked
they
appreciate
me
fast
enough
returned
terry
imperturbably
i
promised
polly
to
spend
my
first
vacation
with
after
married
oh
you
see
i
make
a
farmer
one
of
these
days
i
laughed
and
then
said
seriously
whether
you
made
the
marriage
or
not
you
have
cleared
radnor
name
from
any
suspicion
of
dishonor
and
i
do
know
how
we
can
ever
sufficiently
show
our
gratitude
that
all
right
said
terry
with
a
deprecatory
wave
of
his
hand
i
enjoyed
it
never
did
anything
just
like
it
before
i
arranged
a
good
many
funerals
of
one
sort
or
another
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
arranged
a
marriage
and
jove
but
i
could
make
a
story
out
of
it
he
added
regretfully
if
she
only
let
me
tell
the
truth
the
events
which
i
have
chronicled
happened
a
number
of
years
ago
and
has
never
since
figured
in
the
papers
i
trust
that
its
public
life
is
ended
in
spite
of
the
most
search
the
murderer
of
colonel
gaylord
was
never
found
radnor
and
i
have
always
believed
that
he
was
lynched
by
a
mob
in
west
virginia
some
two
years
later
the
description
of
the
man
tallied
exactly
with
the
appearance
of
the
tramp
my
uncle
had
thrashed
and
something
he
said
in
his
statement
made
us
very
sure
of
the
fact
mose
until
the
time
of
his
death
was
an
honored
member
of
the
household
but
he
did
not
long
outlive
the
colonel
the
memory
of
the
tragedy
he
had
witnessed
seemed
to
follow
him
constantly
an
unreasoning
terror
looked
from
his
eyes
and
he
started
and
shivered
at
every
sound
the
poor
fellow
had
lost
what
few
wits
he
had
ever
possessed
but
the
one
rational
gleam
that
stayed
with
him
to
the
end
was
his
love
for
his
old
master
when
he
lay
dying
radnor
tells
me
he
roused
after
hours
of
unconsciousness
to
call
the
colonel
name
i
have
always
felt
that
this
devotion
spoke
equally
well
for
both
of
them
the
old
man
must
have
had
some
splendid
traits
underneath
his
crusty
exterior
to
awaken
such
unquestioning
love
in
a
person
of
mose
instinctive
perceptions
perhaps
after
all
half
idiot
though
he
was
mose
could
see
clearer
than
the
rest
of
us
he
now
lies
in
the
little
family
on
the
edge
of
the
plantation
a
stone
throw
from
the
grave
of
colonel
gaylord
there
has
never
been
any
further
rumor
of
a
at
and
we
hope
that
the
family
ghost
is
laid
forever
the
deserted
cabins
have
been
torn
down
and
the
fourth
pool
dredged
and
confined
prosaically
enough
within
its
banks
its
mysterious
charm
is
gone
but
it
yields
every
season
some
fifteen
barrels
of
watercress
it
was
the
following
april
a
year
from
the
time
of
my
first
visit
that
terry
and
i
snatched
a
couple
of
days
from
our
work
purchased
new
frock
coats
and
served
as
ushers
at
polly
wedding
she
and
radnor
have
been
living
happily
at
ever
since
and
the
house
with
a
young
mistress
is
a
very
different
place
from
the
house
as
it
used
to
be
marriage
and
responsibility
have
improved
radnor
immensely
he
has
developed
from
a
recklessly
headstrong
boy
into
a
keen
rational
upright
man
i
am
sure
that
polly
has
never
for
a
moment
had
cause
to
regret
her
choice
when
the
estate
was
settled
radnor
very
justly
insisted
on
breaking
his
father
will
and
giving
to
jeff
his
rightful
share
of
the
property
jeff
has
since
become
and
respectable
he
owns
a
raisin
ranch
in
southern
california
with
fifty
chinamen
to
run
it
when
he
comes
back
to
plantation
on
an
occasional
visit
he
occupies
the
guest
room
