castle
no
said
the
curiosity
dealer
that
mummy
is
not
for
sale
i
had
too
big
a
job
to
get
it
tell
me
about
it
i
asked
the
curiosity
dealer
carefully
closed
and
locked
the
case
and
then
meditatively
rolled
a
cigarette
well
it
was
this
way
you
see
i
was
out
after
snakes
and
other
natural
history
specimens
i
had
a
special
order
from
a
chap
in
new
york
for
three
hundred
snakes
he
wanted
some
big
rattlers
i
think
i
sent
him
some
that
pleased
him
anyhow
he
paid
for
them
all
right
i
had
a
customer
who
wanted
a
rattlesnake
with
a
very
big
rattle
and
i
fixed
up
a
snake
for
him
on
this
trip
and
sent
it
to
him
afterwards
it
had
one
hundred
and
eighteen
rattles
i
glued
a
lot
of
rattles
together
and
by
taking
off
the
buttons
it
was
pretty
hard
to
see
where
they
were
joined
this
rattle
was
more
than
a
foot
long
there
was
another
eastern
chap
wanted
an
ibex
which
he
said
was
found
up
in
these
mountains
it
had
horns
curved
over
at
the
tips
like
a
chamois
and
striped
legs
and
eyes
that
stuck
out
like
an
antelope
he
had
heard
about
the
ibex
and
wanted
a
pair
i
told
him
i
had
often
killed
them
but
they
were
hard
to
get
what
is
an
ibex
i
asked
i
be
hanged
if
i
know
answered
the
collector
but
there
are
fellows
in
these
mountains
who
say
that
there
really
are
such
animals
and
if
he
wanted
to
have
an
ibex
and
had
to
have
an
ibex
i
might
as
well
get
him
an
ibex
as
anybody
else
even
if
i
had
to
make
one
but
to
get
back
to
my
story
i
had
a
big
outfit
on
this
trip
and
i
expected
to
get
a
lot
of
curios
one
way
and
another
what
with
snakes
and
animals
of
various
kinds
besides
all
the
things
that
i
might
pick
up
in
the
way
of
baskets
and
indian
relics
which
might
prove
salable
my
outfit
consisted
of
two
wagons
five
horses
and
i
had
a
mexican
along
to
look
after
the
teams
and
do
the
cooking
after
being
out
some
two
weeks
we
found
ourselves
near
what
is
called
castle
up
by
the
verde
there
are
a
lot
of
caves
scattered
about
up
there
supposed
to
have
been
made
by
the
cave
dwellers
and
many
of
them
had
never
been
touched
or
examined
i
had
an
offer
of
good
money
for
a
mummy
and
had
tried
making
them
from
the
bodies
of
indian
children
but
i
never
could
get
them
to
look
real
the
bones
are
not
crumbly
enough
and
the
rags
which
the
real
mummies
are
done
up
in
are
pretty
difficult
to
imitate
i
was
mighty
anxious
to
explore
the
big
caves
so
off
we
went
to
the
place
and
i
tell
you
the
old
ruin
they
call
castle
is
a
dandy
and
do
you
forget
it
the
castle
is
built
on
a
ledge
high
up
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
which
hangs
over
at
the
top
the
only
way
to
get
up
is
by
ladders
or
ropes
and
it
is
mighty
hard
to
get
there
even
then
right
near
there
on
the
face
of
the
high
cliff
there
are
a
lot
of
fine
old
cliff
dwellings
and
some
of
them
are
more
than
one
hundred
feet
from
the
base
these
cliffs
are
straight
up
and
down
sometimes
nearly
smooth
but
often
with
narrow
broken
ledges
here
and
there
on
the
face
of
the
wall
one
particular
cave
which
seemed
to
be
a
rather
large
one
was
about
fifty
feet
up
and
immediately
below
it
were
two
or
three
small
ledges
which
after
i
had
looked
the
place
over
seemed
to
me
to
be
sufficiently
wide
to
hold
a
ladder
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
if
i
wished
to
explore
one
of
these
caves
i
had
better
try
the
one
in
question
in
my
outfit
i
had
two
large
tents
nine
by
fourteen
and
the
poles
of
these
tents
it
seemed
to
me
would
answer
very
well
for
ladders
if
i
connected
them
by
pieces
of
rope
it
was
not
necessary
to
make
the
steps
very
near
together
and
by
cutting
notches
in
the
poles
and
tying
pieces
of
rope
across
i
succeeded
in
making
two
very
good
ladders
one
fourteen
feet
long
with
the
two
top
poles
one
from
each
tent
and
two
small
ladders
each
about
seven
feet
i
made
these
last
from
the
four
upright
tent
poles
there
being
two
to
each
tent
as
you
know
the
foot
of
the
cliff
was
rough
and
the
first
fifteen
feet
or
so
we
could
climb
easily
to
a
broad
ledge
then
there
came
a
space
between
nine
and
ten
feet
in
height
which
was
as
smooth
and
perpendicular
as
a
wall
here
my
first
ladder
was
put
up
two
small
ledges
above
this
some
three
feet
apart
and
a
wider
ledge
four
feet
higher
allowed
me
to
climb
up
without
the
use
of
ladders
to
another
ledge
from
here
i
ran
another
small
ladder
up
to
a
ledge
which
was
between
two
and
three
feet
wide
from
this
ledge
to
the
entrance
of
the
cave
was
about
twelve
feet
and
my
ladder
answered
finely
but
the
difficulty
was
it
had
to
stand
so
straight
that
it
was
rather
ticklish
business
going
up
one
could
not
help
feeling
that
a
slip
or
a
little
backward
jerk
would
topple
it
over
into
the
valley
below
and
as
from
the
ledge
where
it
stood
to
the
bottom
was
some
forty
feet
a
tumble
on
to
the
rocks
would
prove
most
unpleasant
however
my
mexican
antonio
held
the
ladder
and
by
very
careful
work
i
succeeded
in
reaching
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
crawling
in
i
had
no
sooner
entered
than
i
felt
pretty
sure
it
had
never
previously
been
visited
by
any
one
since
the
original
inhabitants
left
it
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
take
a
stout
piece
of
twine
from
my
pocket
and
fasten
the
end
of
the
ladder
to
a
piece
of
rock
then
i
felt
easier
there
were
numerous
bits
of
broken
pottery
scattered
about
and
one
nearly
perfect
specimen
besides
these
there
was
a
very
interesting
bit
of
stone
carving
these
things
i
gathered
together
and
placed
in
a
heap
near
the
entrance
i
then
went
back
and
taking
a
small
hatchet
which
i
had
brought
with
me
commenced
to
dig
about
in
the
floor
and
pretty
soon
found
this
little
child
mummy
by
the
time
i
had
taken
it
out
i
was
pretty
thirsty
and
hot
as
you
may
suppose
i
was
careful
and
did
not
hurry
matters
and
the
cave
was
like
an
oven
wrapping
the
little
mummy
carefully
in
a
big
handkerchief
which
i
had
tied
round
my
neck
i
untied
the
twine
from
the
ladder
and
lowered
the
bundle
slowly
down
to
antonio
my
mexican
who
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
top
ladder
it
reached
him
safely
but
while
he
was
untying
it
i
carelessly
dropped
the
end
of
the
string
i
went
back
however
and
gathered
up
the
other
relics
intending
to
take
some
of
them
down
with
me
and
then
come
back
for
the
rest
if
i
could
not
manage
them
all
the
first
time
while
i
was
looking
them
over
i
heard
a
crash
and
the
sound
of
tumbling
stones
and
looking
out
i
saw
that
the
ladder
had
fallen
and
commenced
to
curse
antonio
for
his
carelessness
but
imagine
my
horror
when
i
saw
him
throw
down
the
bottom
ladder
and
then
run
as
fast
as
he
could
towards
the
camp
my
first
and
only
thought
was
to
pay
antonio
for
his
treachery
it
was
evidently
his
intention
to
leave
me
safely
housed
in
a
place
from
which
i
could
never
escape
alive
and
start
off
the
proud
owner
of
the
two
wagons
five
horses
and
various
valuables
which
he
believed
my
boxes
to
contain
my
revolver
was
still
in
my
belt
and
hastily
pulling
it
i
commenced
shooting
at
the
running
figure
now
some
sixty
or
seventy
yards
distant
the
first
bullet
knocked
up
a
cloud
of
dust
about
three
feet
to
his
right
and
a
little
ahead
the
second
was
still
worse
but
at
the
third
he
turned
sideways
staggered
on
several
paces
and
fell
among
some
loose
rocks
in
a
way
that
must
have
been
unpleasant
he
tried
to
get
up
again
but
i
now
had
his
range
pretty
well
and
hit
him
again
with
the
sixth
shot
after
that
he
lay
pretty
quiet
although
i
thought
i
saw
him
move
his
arm
once
or
twice
i
reloaded
having
plenty
of
cartridges
in
my
belt
and
began
shooting
at
him
again
this
time
i
hit
him
three
times
out
of
six
shots
and
as
he
had
not
moved
for
some
minutes
i
concluded
that
he
was
dead
then
i
began
to
think
over
how
i
was
going
to
get
down
i
was
very
thirsty
and
it
was
tantalizing
to
see
the
water
down
in
the
valley
sparkling
in
the
sunlight
it
looked
very
clear
and
refreshing
i
thought
and
thought
and
the
more
i
thought
the
more
hopeless
it
seemed
to
me
to
plan
a
way
to
get
down
alive
there
was
one
ladder
still
standing
the
second
one
but
there
was
a
space
of
some
thirty
feet
before
i
could
reach
it
i
had
absolutely
nothing
not
even
a
string
to
aid
me
in
getting
down
there
was
no
use
hoping
for
help
from
any
one
for
the
place
was
rarely
visited
and
it
might
be
weeks
before
any
person
would
discover
that
i
was
there
i
was
getting
more
thirsty
all
the
time
and
at
last
i
hated
to
go
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
hot
as
it
was
inside
because
the
sight
of
the
water
nearly
drove
me
mad
i
amused
myself
by
occasionally
taking
a
shot
at
antonio
i
had
his
range
down
pretty
fine
now
and
rarely
missed
him
it
was
getting
late
and
the
sun
had
long
since
sunk
out
of
sight
above
the
mountains
there
was
one
tall
peak
which
i
could
see
up
the
cañon
it
stood
out
in
the
sunlight
bright
and
shining
even
after
the
cañon
had
become
quite
dark
as
the
sun
sank
lower
and
lower
the
darkness
crept
gradually
up
until
only
the
very
top
was
left
a
shining
point
for
a
few
minutes
it
shone
a
fiery
red
and
then
the
light
was
gone
like
a
huge
torch
which
flickers
and
goes
out
then
the
night
noises
commenced
the
incessant
maddening
croaking
of
the
frogs
and
now
and
then
an
owl
did
you
ever
hear
the
frogs
in
arizona
i
responded
in
the
affirmative
well
then
you
know
something
about
what
they
sound
like
and
know
they
can
give
eastern
frogs
cards
and
spades
and
beat
them
easy
but
you
do
know
what
they
sound
like
when
you
are
thirsty
probably
not
i
answered
well
continued
the
curiosity
dealer
i
knew
nothing
could
be
done
until
morning
so
i
lay
down
and
tried
to
sleep
i
was
very
nervous
and
could
not
help
fearing
that
in
the
night
i
might
walk
in
my
sleep
or
roll
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
tumble
out
i
do
not
think
i
really
slept
at
all
but
lay
in
a
condition
until
it
was
light
enough
for
me
to
see
things
in
the
cañon
below
strange
to
say
i
was
not
hungry
although
i
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
previous
morning
my
whole
thoughts
were
concentrated
on
the
one
desire
something
to
drink
i
thought
and
pondered
trying
to
think
of
some
possible
way
to
get
down
at
one
time
i
thought
seriously
of
jumping
to
the
ledge
below
but
i
knew
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
stay
on
it
even
if
my
legs
were
not
broken
by
the
fall
and
that
to
jump
meant
practically
to
commit
suicide
at
last
a
thought
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
possibly
make
a
rope
out
of
my
clothes
i
had
a
large
and
a
hatchet
and
no
sooner
had
the
thought
suggested
itself
than
i
commenced
to
undress
my
canvas
coat
shirt
and
trousers
and
some
thin
underclothes
constituted
my
entire
wardrobe
and
by
carefully
cutting
them
into
strips
wide
enough
to
bear
my
weight
and
yet
narrow
enough
to
give
sufficient
length
i
succeeded
in
making
a
kind
of
a
rope
with
which
i
hoped
i
could
succeed
in
reaching
the
second
ladder
without
broken
bones
i
could
not
work
steadily
as
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
avoid
getting
up
and
now
and
then
walking
about
the
cave
i
suffered
so
with
the
heat
and
thirst
that
the
hope
of
escape
alone
kept
me
from
going
mad
at
last
the
rope
was
done
and
tied
together
with
various
knots
it
had
a
creepy
sort
of
stretchy
feeling
when
i
pulled
on
it
but
i
had
no
alternative
but
to
trust
to
it
it
was
that
or
nothing
and
nothing
meant
death
from
thirst
in
a
very
short
time
i
succeeded
in
fixing
the
hatchet
firmly
into
and
across
a
cleft
in
the
rock
where
it
was
split
and
it
gave
me
something
to
tie
the
rope
to
which
i
was
satisfied
would
hold
my
weight
i
tied
the
end
of
the
rope
to
the
hatchet
handle
and
threw
the
other
end
down
and
was
mighty
glad
to
see
that
it
reached
within
four
or
five
feet
of
the
middle
ledge
i
was
stark
naked
excepting
my
shoes
and
i
tell
you
it
was
no
easy
task
letting
one
self
down
over
the
sharp
edges
of
the
rock
every
moment
i
expected
one
of
the
knots
to
give
way
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
feeling
which
came
over
me
as
i
swung
myself
clear
of
the
ledge
and
hung
swaying
on
that
improvised
rope
which
seemed
to
stretch
and
grow
thin
in
a
way
which
sent
cold
shivers
running
up
and
down
my
spine
it
seemed
a
year
before
i
reached
the
ledge
i
went
down
pretty
slow
sparing
the
rope
as
much
as
i
could
by
supporting
part
of
my
weight
by
digging
my
toes
into
every
little
crack
and
crevice
i
could
find
but
i
got
there
at
last
and
when
i
did
i
sat
down
on
the
ledge
and
cried
like
a
baby
well
that
is
the
story
of
course
i
got
down
the
rest
of
the
way
all
right
or
i
would
be
here
but
i
do
know
as
i
would
have
done
it
if
antonio
had
pulled
down
the
second
ladder
instead
of
the
bottom
one
he
was
evidently
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
do
the
job
up
right
after
reaching
the
second
ladder
it
was
no
kind
of
a
trick
to
slide
it
down
and
use
it
over
again
the
first
thing
i
did
when
i
got
down
was
to
run
as
fast
as
i
could
to
the
river
and
drink
as
much
water
as
i
dared
then
i
lay
down
in
the
water
and
enjoyed
it
talk
about
your
paradise
cocktails
they
are
not
to
be
compared
with
that
verde
river
water
which
i
tasted
that
day
antonio
oh
yes
he
is
there
yet
i
believe
although
i
have
never
been
back
since
to
see
and
i
hope
i
never
will
my
first
experience
among
the
cliff
dwellers
was
all
sufficient
the
amateur
championship
i
a
committee
from
the
phœnix
athletic
club
and
one
from
the
prescott
club
had
met
and
after
considerable
discussion
had
arranged
a
match
to
decide
the
amateur
championship
of
arizona
as
the
phœnix
and
prescott
clubs
were
far
and
away
the
foremost
athletic
organizations
in
the
territory
the
contest
was
looked
forward
to
with
a
great
interest
especially
as
an
intense
rivalry
existed
between
the
two
cities
let
the
contest
be
fair
and
square
on
both
sides
said
smith
the
chairman
of
the
phœnix
committee
let
each
club
send
its
best
man
who
is
strictly
an
amateur
of
course
and
a
member
of
the
club
in
good
standing
and
let
the
best
man
win
them
my
sentiments
exactly
responded
johnson
the
chairman
of
the
prescott
committee
fair
play
and
honors
to
the
best
man
say
i
i
did
think
of
sending
a
young
fellow
i
know
in
our
club
who
took
some
sparring
lessons
in
last
year
and
is
quite
clever
he
a
gunsmith
by
profession
but
the
trouble
is
he
has
been
teaching
the
boys
during
his
spare
time
when
he
could
get
away
from
the
shop
and
that
makes
him
a
professional
does
it
it
does
said
smith
and
i
am
glad
to
find
you
are
as
particular
as
i
am
in
such
matters
let
me
tell
you
it
is
a
pleasure
to
meet
a
man
like
yourself
who
tries
to
be
fair
and
square
and
to
take
no
advantage
of
anybody
let
take
something
during
the
next
few
days
there
were
anxious
meetings
of
the
committees
in
charge
of
the
arrangements
a
certain
man
well
up
in
sporting
matters
went
to
as
a
committee
of
one
representing
the
prescott
club
to
hunt
for
talent
at
the
same
time
a
brother
of
the
chairman
of
the
phœnix
committee
who
kept
a
in
chicago
received
a
letter
which
caused
considerable
discussion
between
him
and
his
partner
and
several
interviews
with
a
certain
individual
who
frequented
his
place
what
i
want
said
the
letter
is
the
best
man
you
can
get
some
one
who
is
a
sure
winner
and
can
punch
the
stuffing
out
of
this
amateur
duck
from
prescott
do
make
a
mistake
and
do
not
spare
money
get
a
star
as
the
boys
will
bet
all
they
have
on
him
and
we
do
not
want
to
take
any
chances
the
following
week
the
chairman
of
the
committee
of
the
phœnix
organization
received
a
letter
from
his
brother
in
chicago
which
informed
him
that
for
two
hundred
dollars
and
expenses
they
had
secured
the
services
of
a
professional
but
one
who
had
never
been
west
and
who
they
were
sure
could
lick
anything
which
could
be
produced
professional
or
amateur
on
the
pacific
coast
he
had
commenced
training
and
they
could
rest
easy
and
bet
as
much
money
as
they
wanted
to
meanwhile
the
prescott
club
representative
had
made
a
rich
find
in
san
francisco
in
the
shape
of
an
australian
professional
who
had
just
landed
and
was
therefore
not
likely
to
be
recognized
he
had
a
record
of
numerous
victories
in
his
own
country
and
cheerfully
undertook
for
the
sum
of
dollars
to
knock
the
bloomin
head
off
any
bloomin
duffer
anywhere
near
his
own
weight
that
might
be
brought
against
him
things
went
along
merrily
letters
were
exchanged
between
the
chairman
of
the
two
committees
reporting
as
to
the
progress
of
their
representatives
our
young
man
wrote
the
prescott
leader
is
doing
very
well
and
i
hope
great
things
from
him
naturally
we
want
to
win
and
have
secured
the
best
man
of
good
amateur
standing
in
our
town
to
represent
us
he
is
a
drug
clerk
and
his
mother
objected
pretty
strongly
at
first
but
she
has
been
talked
over
there
will
be
a
party
of
at
least
one
hundred
of
us
go
down
with
him
and
i
hope
you
will
have
front
seats
reserved
for
us
most
of
the
boys
feel
inclined
to
wager
a
little
on
the
success
of
our
representative
but
he
himself
does
not
feel
very
confident
of
the
result
upon
my
return
i
found
quite
a
strong
feeling
in
favor
of
having
the
young
gunsmith
represent
us
but
after
my
conversation
with
you
could
not
for
a
moment
countenance
any
such
proceedings
on
our
part
two
nights
following
the
prescott
chairman
read
the
following
letter
in
answer
to
the
one
which
he
had
sent
to
johnson
of
the
committee
for
the
prescott
athletic
dear
sir
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
there
is
considerable
interest
taken
in
the
forthcoming
match
boxing
is
a
noble
art
and
this
coming
contest
will
no
doubt
help
to
boom
both
our
clubs
there
is
a
great
interest
taken
here
in
the
match
and
i
warn
you
our
man
is
getting
himself
in
the
very
best
condition
possible
he
is
nervous
of
course
this
being
his
first
appearance
in
an
affair
of
this
kind
he
is
a
clerk
in
a
bank
who
has
lately
been
engaged
by
my
friend
robinson
and
therefore
does
not
get
as
much
time
for
exercise
as
perhaps
would
be
wise
but
robinson
is
an
enthusiastic
sport
as
you
know
and
has
arranged
to
let
him
get
off
several
hours
each
day
we
look
forward
to
a
great
contest
and
i
certainly
feel
that
the
winner
may
fully
consider
himself
the
amateur
champion
of
the
territory
we
shall
take
great
satisfaction
in
reserving
the
one
hundred
seats
you
ask
for
i
think
you
will
find
all
the
money
ready
for
you
in
the
way
of
bets
that
you
will
want
our
population
is
made
up
a
great
deal
as
you
know
largely
of
miners
and
ranchers
and
they
are
inclined
to
bet
recklessly
i
can
not
close
without
congratulating
the
prescott
athletic
club
for
the
energy
and
enterprise
they
have
shown
in
this
matter
may
the
best
man
win
yours
smith
ii
there
was
a
great
crowd
packed
into
the
ring
of
the
phœnix
athletic
association
on
the
evening
of
the
contest
seats
were
at
a
premium
and
the
fight
had
been
the
principal
subject
of
conversation
for
days
the
two
principals
had
met
and
been
introduced
to
one
another
just
before
going
to
the
scene
of
the
contest
both
were
dressed
for
the
occasion
and
i
tell
you
they
were
sights
the
bank
clerk
had
on
a
collar
so
high
that
he
could
hardly
turn
his
head
a
high
silk
hat
long
black
and
an
immense
white
rose
in
his
buttonhole
the
prescott
drug
clerk
was
still
more
gorgeous
besides
a
buttonhole
bouquet
and
high
collar
he
sported
an
and
smoked
a
cigarette
while
in
the
presence
of
his
opponent
yer
bloomin
remarked
the
drug
clerk
hi
as
yer
fit
go
arn
answered
the
embryo
financier
using
only
one
side
of
his
mouth
do
try
ter
jolly
me
yer
dude
or
i
give
yer
a
poke
right
here
several
members
of
the
committee
hastened
to
interfere
and
put
a
stop
to
all
further
danger
of
trouble
by
hurrying
the
principals
off
to
their
to
prepare
for
the
contest
in
the
smith
hugged
robinson
and
nearly
wept
with
joy
when
they
were
alone
did
you
take
a
good
look
at
the
stiff
he
gasped
why
our
man
will
punch
daylight
out
of
him
in
two
minutes
after
the
gong
sounds
why
i
say
this
is
wrong
it
is
too
easy
i
really
feel
sorry
for
these
prescott
chaps
robinson
chuckled
and
muttered
something
about
fools
and
their
money
being
soon
parted
and
then
the
two
worthies
repaired
to
the
ringside
smith
was
to
be
master
of
the
ceremonies
and
climbing
upon
the
raised
platform
he
crawled
through
the
ropes
and
after
looking
about
him
for
a
moment
raised
his
hands
to
enjoin
silence
gentlemen
he
said
i
must
beg
you
all
to
stop
smoking
the
contest
which
is
to
be
held
here
is
to
decide
the
amateur
championship
of
the
territory
of
arizona
nothing
is
more
calculated
to
incite
among
our
younger
men
the
love
for
athletic
sports
than
such
competitions
when
conducted
in
a
fair
and
sportsmanlike
manner
i
must
beg
of
you
not
to
allow
yourselves
to
be
biased
towards
indulging
in
any
unseemly
noise
in
case
your
favorite
should
be
worsted
what
we
want
is
a
fair
field
and
no
favoritism
and
while
we
hope
our
boy
will
win
none
of
you
i
am
sure
would
wish
in
any
way
to
feel
that
either
man
was
given
any
undue
advantage
the
men
will
fight
with
gloves
marquis
of
queensbury
rules
three
minutes
to
each
round
with
a
minute
rest
between
a
man
down
to
get
up
inside
of
ten
seconds
or
be
counted
out
no
hitting
in
the
clinches
many
of
you
are
acquainted
with
the
gentlemen
who
are
our
representatives
this
evening
but
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
not
i
will
introduce
them
waving
his
hand
towards
the
prescott
pugilist
he
said
this
is
alexander
harrington
amateur
champion
of
the
prescott
athletic
club
who
is
i
may
say
by
profession
a
popular
druggist
in
the
town
from
which
he
comes
considerable
applause
and
this
he
continued
pointing
to
the
man
who
represented
the
phœnix
club
is
francis
livingstone
a
young
man
who
has
shown
himself
to
be
a
good
exponent
of
the
noble
art
and
who
is
deemed
to
be
the
amateur
champion
of
the
phœnix
athletic
association
as
he
has
only
lately
arrived
and
is
not
very
well
known
to
many
of
you
i
may
add
that
he
is
a
personal
friend
of
our
robinson
and
is
employed
at
his
bank
wild
enthusiasm
as
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
the
amateur
standing
of
the
gentlemen
i
will
again
beg
of
you
to
treat
both
men
with
equal
favor
and
will
ask
the
referee
to
call
time
the
seconds
at
this
climbed
down
from
the
ringside
shoving
their
stools
out
under
the
ropes
and
the
two
athletes
throwing
aside
their
bath
robes
stood
up
in
their
corners
each
stripped
to
the
buff
with
the
exception
of
tight
trunks
and
canvas
shoes
a
roar
of
admiration
and
astonishment
went
up
as
the
bank
clerk
first
exposed
himself
and
robinson
grinned
at
smith
across
the
ring
as
the
splendid
exhibition
of
muscle
was
exhibited
it
was
evident
that
the
bank
clerk
had
not
devoted
all
his
time
to
banking
he
was
apparently
as
fit
as
a
and
the
muscles
of
his
back
and
arms
twisted
and
rolled
about
like
snakes
at
every
movement
but
robinson
expression
altered
somewhat
as
he
glanced
at
the
drug
clerk
that
individual
was
somewhat
shorter
than
his
opponent
but
if
the
banking
representative
was
well
developed
he
of
the
pharmaceutical
persuasion
was
magnificent
both
men
had
been
fanned
and
washed
their
gloves
carefully
tied
on
and
they
now
stood
rubbing
their
shoes
on
some
powdered
rosin
which
was
scattered
about
the
corners
eyeing
each
other
intently
what
they
thought
will
probably
never
be
given
to
the
public
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
each
must
have
experienced
a
feeling
of
surprise
at
the
physical
condition
of
his
opponent
this
did
not
affect
them
in
the
least
however
as
they
were
both
as
anxious
to
begin
as
and
when
time
was
called
and
the
gong
rang
they
danced
to
the
middle
and
commenced
sparring
for
an
opening
grinning
with
confidence
for
the
first
minute
or
two
nothing
was
done
forward
and
back
they
moved
their
arms
moving
in
and
out
each
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
face
of
his
opponent
watching
closely
for
an
opening
then
the
bank
clerk
jumped
in
and
led
one
two
without
effect
for
his
first
blow
was
neatly
guarded
and
the
second
brought
a
vicious
in
return
which
grazed
his
nose
as
he
got
back
out
of
the
way
in
came
the
drug
clerk
with
a
rush
and
they
closed
just
as
the
gong
sounded
which
ended
the
round
up
through
the
ropes
came
the
seconds
with
the
activity
of
a
lot
of
monkeys
and
the
two
men
were
hurriedly
seated
upon
stools
and
each
was
fanned
furiously
with
a
towel
by
one
second
while
the
other
bathed
his
neck
and
face
with
cold
water
a
hum
of
conversation
arose
who
is
the
blooming
duck
whispered
the
druggist
to
his
principal
second
ai
no
bleeding
dude
i
can
tell
yer
but
before
the
man
had
time
to
reply
the
gong
sounded
the
call
of
time
and
the
men
sprang
forward
to
the
middle
of
the
ring
there
was
no
sparring
this
time
they
went
at
it
biff
bang
right
and
left
sending
in
their
blows
with
all
the
power
of
their
muscular
bodies
the
referee
almost
dancing
with
excitement
shouted
to
them
to
break
away
and
tried
to
part
them
when
they
clinched
but
they
were
no
sooner
separated
than
they
closed
again
fighting
with
the
energy
and
tenacity
of
just
before
time
was
up
the
drug
clerk
swung
his
right
and
caught
the
gentleman
of
finance
fair
and
square
on
the
nose
with
the
result
that
prescott
was
awarded
first
blood
and
first
amid
great
excitement
during
the
one
minute
rest
the
seconds
did
wonders
the
men
were
sponged
and
rubbed
while
fanned
constantly
with
a
large
towel
water
was
squirted
on
their
heads
and
the
back
of
their
necks
and
at
the
sound
of
the
gong
each
arose
from
his
stool
looking
as
fresh
as
at
the
start
opened
as
though
it
would
be
a
repetition
of
the
hurricane
style
of
fighting
of
the
previous
round
but
after
a
clinch
or
two
and
giving
and
receiving
a
few
good
blows
the
men
kept
apart
and
fought
more
warily
each
had
evidently
become
satisfied
that
the
other
was
not
quite
the
easy
victim
he
had
expected
and
as
this
conviction
gradually
dawned
upon
them
they
dropped
the
rough
and
tumble
style
and
fought
with
more
skill
and
caution
each
watching
and
waiting
for
an
opening
hoping
for
a
chance
for
a
but
none
came
and
the
round
closed
with
honors
even
during
the
intermission
watkins
the
sheriff
who
was
acting
as
referee
talked
earnestly
with
a
friend
and
from
time
to
time
looked
hard
at
the
drug
clerk
he
turned
towards
the
and
seemed
about
to
say
something
when
the
bell
rang
and
the
men
were
again
in
the
middle
of
the
ring
had
commenced
they
were
both
fresh
and
eager
but
business
was
written
all
over
their
hard
faces
they
were
not
smiling
now
round
and
round
they
moved
constantly
facing
each
other
their
arms
moving
back
and
forth
like
a
machine
now
and
then
one
or
the
other
would
make
a
quick
feint
or
move
and
the
other
would
spring
back
with
the
agility
of
a
suddenly
the
financier
thought
he
saw
an
opening
and
let
go
his
left
but
was
short
and
received
a
counter
in
return
which
sounded
all
over
the
place
then
they
went
at
it
hammer
and
tongs
and
kept
the
referee
very
busy
separating
them
and
making
them
fight
fair
questionable
methods
were
resorted
to
by
both
men
and
the
knowledge
shown
by
these
amateurs
of
the
little
unfair
tricks
of
the
professional
was
astonishing
the
bank
clerk
took
especial
pains
to
stick
his
thumb
in
his
opponent
eye
whenever
they
clinched
and
the
compounder
of
drugs
used
his
head
and
elbow
in
a
way
which
is
frowned
upon
by
advocates
of
fair
play
the
men
were
fighting
hard
and
fast
when
the
round
ended
every
man
in
the
crowd
was
on
his
feet
yelling
like
a
hyena
as
they
went
to
their
corners
referee
watkins
walked
to
the
side
of
the
ring
and
raising
his
hand
to
enjoin
silence
stood
waiting
for
the
uproar
to
subside
at
last
when
he
could
be
heard
he
addressed
the
crowd
as
follows
gentlemen
i
am
sorry
to
stop
this
fight
but
i
must
do
it
these
men
are
supposed
to
be
fightin
for
the
amatoor
champeenship
of
the
territory
whether
this
is
a
job
or
not
i
do
not
know
but
i
do
know
that
the
prescott
man
is
a
professional
pug
lately
arrived
from
australia
i
suspected
him
from
the
first
from
the
way
he
acted
i
was
pretty
blamed
sure
he
was
no
drug
clerk
and
my
friend
here
jim
sweeney
swears
he
knows
him
and
that
he
was
called
the
boy
when
he
saw
him
fight
in
australia
some
seven
months
ago
i
ca
let
this
thing
go
on
and
have
honest
men
lose
their
money
i
am
not
dead
sure
in
my
mind
that
the
other
man
is
a
ringer
he
is
a
damned
sight
too
good
for
an
amatoor
but
that
cuts
no
ice
this
fight
stops
right
now
a
draw
and
all
bets
are
off
there
was
a
tremendous
row
but
the
pugilists
were
hurried
off
to
their
respective
and
the
crowd
slowly
left
the
building
on
the
steps
outside
johnson
the
chairman
of
the
prescott
athletic
club
met
smith
and
going
up
to
him
he
offered
him
his
hand
smith
said
he
i
want
to
tell
you
how
pained
i
am
that
the
affair
ended
as
it
did
you
of
course
do
not
for
a
moment
suspect
that
any
of
us
knew
our
man
was
a
professional
how
he
could
deceive
us
i
can
not
understand
why
i
was
never
more
fooled
in
my
life
smith
shook
hands
heartily
do
say
a
word
johnson
the
best
of
us
are
often
deceived
and
the
more
pure
our
motives
are
the
easier
it
is
to
fool
us
that
so
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
a
short
distance
smith
hallo
pity
they
stopped
it
it
was
a
lovely
scrap
while
it
lasted
that
what
it
was
said
smith
the
tragedy
of
the
white
tanks
i
do
not
believe
said
the
curiosity
dealer
that
the
bite
of
the
gila
monster
is
fatal
it
is
poisonous
no
doubt
and
there
have
been
one
or
two
cases
of
death
where
persons
have
been
bitten
by
it
but
it
is
always
well
to
remember
that
the
teeth
themselves
may
be
in
a
condition
to
produce
which
might
cause
death
without
the
assistance
of
any
particular
toxic
venom
the
rattlesnake
however
which
is
rather
too
common
in
the
desert
is
a
different
sort
of
a
chap
if
he
strikes
you
you
may
just
as
well
make
your
will
and
chirp
your
death
song
as
to
monkey
with
physicians
and
squander
some
of
the
good
wealth
which
may
be
useful
to
your
family
i
asked
him
if
he
did
not
believe
in
the
efficacy
of
some
of
the
indian
snake
cures
there
are
lots
of
indian
remedies
he
continued
and
snake
cures
for
rattlesnake
bites
which
are
in
my
opinion
all
it
is
claimed
that
the
moquai
indians
during
their
snake
dance
allow
rattlesnakes
to
bite
them
and
after
applying
the
juice
of
a
certain
herb
suffer
no
ill
effects
from
the
poison
this
may
be
all
right
but
the
antidote
is
considerable
of
a
secret
and
you
can
not
buy
it
at
your
druggist
there
was
a
chap
over
in
france
who
claimed
to
have
produced
an
serum
which
was
a
sure
cure
for
the
poison
of
a
rattlesnake
or
any
other
old
snake
which
you
might
want
to
have
bite
you
i
squandered
five
dollars
of
my
wealth
in
sending
for
a
bottle
this
chap
lives
at
lille
france
and
manufactures
his
serum
at
the
pasteur
institute
at
that
place
he
gives
careful
directions
as
to
how
much
to
use
and
just
how
to
use
it
and
it
may
be
all
right
with
some
snakes
which
have
the
reputation
of
being
bad
but
it
do
go
with
our
rattlers
i
tried
it
in
all
sorts
of
ways
i
tried
to
get
a
mexican
to
experiment
on
but
could
none
of
them
had
much
faith
in
the
cure
not
enough
to
let
a
healthy
snake
bite
for
five
dollars
then
i
tried
dogs
i
got
three
curs
all
in
robust
health
the
first
one
died
in
fifteen
minutes
after
being
struck
by
a
big
rattlesnake
which
i
had
in
a
box
although
i
injected
him
with
a
carefully
measured
dose
of
the
serum
another
one
lived
several
hours
and
made
a
hard
struggle
i
thought
at
one
time
he
might
pull
through
but
it
was
no
use
he
joined
his
friend
in
dog
heaven
after
giving
his
final
kick
four
hours
and
fifteen
minutes
after
he
and
the
snake
had
been
introduced
to
each
other
the
third
one
was
a
bull
bitch
with
lots
of
vitality
i
tried
to
make
this
one
immune
by
injecting
a
dose
of
the
serum
hours
before
and
again
immediately
after
she
was
struck
by
the
snake
but
she
did
not
do
as
well
as
the
other
one
and
died
in
three
hours
and
sixteen
minutes
all
these
dogs
seemed
to
die
from
inability
to
breathe
the
poison
apparently
acts
on
the
respiratory
centres
rather
than
directly
on
the
heart
they
all
vomited
just
before
they
died
have
you
never
found
out
what
the
indians
use
as
an
antidote
i
asked
no
i
have
tried
but
they
keep
it
a
carefully
guarded
secret
one
reason
why
i
believe
that
the
secret
is
so
carefully
preserved
is
because
they
have
no
antidote
and
the
whole
thing
is
a
bluff
you
see
continued
the
collector
in
my
wanderings
about
the
country
i
have
run
across
a
great
many
queer
people
and
as
you
seem
interested
in
this
subject
i
will
tell
you
an
incident
which
happened
while
i
was
out
at
camp
one
time
at
the
white
tanks
catching
gila
monsters
horned
toads
etc
i
remember
the
year
well
because
i
had
a
lot
of
trouble
with
a
very
useless
assistant
of
mine
whom
i
sent
to
central
america
to
collect
for
me
among
the
birds
he
brought
back
were
a
lot
of
skins
of
the
blue
chatterer
the
one
with
the
purple
throat
you
know
he
knew
i
was
anxious
to
get
new
species
so
he
thought
he
would
be
smart
and
make
some
for
me
so
he
manufactured
five
all
with
faked
labels
on
showing
that
each
species
was
taken
at
different
altitudes
unfortunately
he
commenced
too
high
and
the
mountains
in
the
vicinity
where
he
collected
and
where
the
labels
indicated
that
the
birds
were
taken
lacked
several
hundred
feet
of
the
necessary
altitude
for
two
of
the
species
so
that
if
his
labels
were
correct
he
must
have
shot
them
out
of
a
balloon
they
all
looked
alike
except
about
the
throat
and
head
one
lot
had
a
gold
band
across
the
breast
another
had
the
whole
throat
gold
others
had
gold
stripes
or
spots
i
believe
he
produced
these
gaudy
effects
with
the
lighted
end
of
his
cigar
he
doctored
up
a
lot
of
too
and
made
me
a
peck
of
trouble
i
fired
him
all
right
dishonesty
in
a
trade
like
mine
is
i
think
most
reprehensible
and
there
is
no
money
in
it
because
you
are
dead
sure
to
get
found
out
he
was
a
cute
little
chap
however
and
had
learned
a
lot
of
tricks
from
the
indians
he
could
change
a
bird
color
by
feeding
it
on
certain
kinds
of
food
there
is
a
chap
in
amsterdam
who
does
about
the
same
thing
and
brightens
up
old
worn
birds
which
have
faded
out
in
the
zoölogical
gardens
and
sends
them
back
with
all
the
brilliancy
of
their
original
plumage
restored
but
he
can
not
turn
a
red
parrot
blue
or
make
a
gray
bird
with
a
yellow
head
turn
to
bright
orange
all
over
as
this
chap
could
he
told
me
how
he
did
it
but
the
secret
is
too
good
to
give
away
but
to
get
back
to
the
story
about
rattlesnakes
it
was
as
i
said
in
the
spring
of
a
party
of
us
were
camped
at
the
white
tanks
about
miles
of
here
and
one
day
a
chap
came
into
our
camp
a
mexican
indian
who
called
himself
a
he
had
a
box
of
rattlesnakes
which
he
would
allow
to
twine
round
his
neck
and
bite
him
for
a
dollar
he
travelled
about
the
country
giving
exhibitions
with
his
snakes
and
selling
the
rattlesnake
cure
which
was
put
up
in
small
bottles
containing
a
liquid
which
he
claimed
he
made
from
a
plant
which
was
a
sure
cure
for
the
bite
of
the
rattlesnake
and
a
number
of
the
boys
bought
this
remedy
paying
him
a
dollar
a
bottle
he
had
seen
our
camp
as
he
drove
along
the
road
to
phœnix
and
he
told
us
he
had
been
up
country
for
two
or
three
weeks
visiting
some
mines
where
he
had
done
very
well
selling
his
cure
to
the
miners
and
exhibiting
his
snakes
there
were
several
of
us
in
the
party
and
one
chap
a
doctor
by
the
name
of
baker
who
was
always
playing
practical
jokes
as
we
were
coming
back
to
phœnix
the
next
day
miguel
which
was
the
real
name
i
believe
although
he
was
generally
known
as
mexican
john
decided
to
stay
over
a
day
and
go
back
with
us
baker
proposed
that
we
should
see
how
much
faith
miguel
had
in
his
own
antidote
as
it
happened
i
had
captured
a
very
big
rattlesnake
the
day
previous
and
had
him
in
a
box
in
my
tent
by
the
aid
of
some
forked
sticks
and
bagging
we
succeeded
in
fastening
the
snake
so
that
he
could
not
move
we
then
pried
his
mouth
open
and
kept
it
open
with
a
small
stick
we
took
all
this
trouble
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
him
to
assist
in
an
experiment
in
which
he
and
mexican
john
were
to
be
the
principal
performers
baker
carefully
cut
out
the
which
are
situated
just
beneath
the
temporal
muscle
back
of
the
eye
it
was
suggested
that
it
would
be
better
to
remove
the
fangs
to
avoid
any
possibility
of
danger
but
baker
objected
as
he
said
removing
the
fangs
would
give
the
whole
thing
away
he
took
the
precaution
however
while
the
snake
lay
helpless
with
its
mouth
open
to
carefully
wash
the
teeth
and
then
filled
the
small
openings
near
the
end
of
the
fangs
with
some
dental
cement
which
baker
had
in
his
outfit
which
hardens
in
a
few
minutes
you
see
the
fangs
of
a
rattlesnake
are
like
two
hypodermic
syringes
they
are
hollow
tubes
as
it
were
with
an
opening
near
the
point
a
little
narrow
slit
but
one
that
is
easily
seen
if
you
look
for
it
through
this
he
squirts
the
poison
by
the
aid
of
the
temporal
muscle
which
he
contracts
as
he
strikes
as
we
had
removed
the
and
plugged
up
the
fangs
this
snake
was
not
in
a
very
good
condition
to
do
any
serious
harm
he
however
was
fighting
mad
and
evidently
did
not
enjoy
the
operation
which
he
had
undergone
it
did
not
seem
to
hurt
him
any
however
for
he
was
as
lively
as
a
kitten
when
we
let
him
loose
in
the
box
and
was
ready
and
anxious
to
strike
at
anything
towards
evening
miguel
came
back
to
camp
and
we
had
the
snake
all
ready
for
him
it
was
a
much
larger
one
than
those
which
he
had
in
his
box
and
when
we
slipped
it
in
among
the
others
we
could
easily
recognize
it
from
its
size
the
boys
asked
john
to
give
an
exhibition
of
the
curative
powers
of
his
snake
cure
saying
that
they
would
like
to
buy
some
more
but
wished
to
see
it
tried
before
doing
so
john
was
quite
ready
and
after
opening
a
bottle
of
the
antidote
he
lifted
the
cover
of
his
snake
box
and
reached
in
his
hand
to
take
one
of
them
out
as
he
did
so
he
was
immediately
struck
good
and
hard
by
our
latest
addition
to
the
collection
my
how
he
carried
on
he
looked
hastily
into
the
box
and
then
at
the
marks
on
his
hand
where
the
fangs
had
cut
in
he
gave
one
screech
grabbed
a
knife
cut
the
place
wide
open
and
commenced
to
suck
it
fiercely
at
the
same
time
praying
and
cursing
almost
in
the
same
breath
the
boys
begged
him
to
apply
his
antidote
asking
him
what
was
the
matter
and
why
he
appeared
to
be
so
frightened
but
all
the
answer
they
could
get
was
touch
me
i
am
going
to
die
i
going
to
die
and
say
what
do
you
think
he
die
he
got
weaker
and
weaker
his
teeth
were
clenched
and
he
refused
to
take
whiskey
although
the
boys
forced
some
down
his
throat
in
a
little
while
he
became
insensible
and
in
less
than
an
hour
he
was
dead
to
death
you
say
well
maybe
so
anyway
the
boys
said
the
laugh
was
on
baker
too
close
for
comfort
when
watson
entered
i
saw
by
his
manner
that
he
had
something
of
more
than
usual
interest
to
communicate
watson
has
a
trick
of
winding
and
unwinding
his
watch
chain
around
his
finger
whenever
he
has
some
case
in
which
he
is
particularly
interested
as
a
rule
his
work
in
the
asylum
keeps
him
busy
the
greater
part
of
the
day
and
the
little
time
he
has
to
spare
is
given
to
cases
in
which
he
is
called
in
consultation
or
by
special
appointment
therefore
knowing
how
busy
he
was
i
felt
certain
that
something
out
of
the
ordinary
had
called
him
from
his
regular
duties
at
this
time
of
day
and
i
was
interested
to
learn
what
it
was
watson
is
nothing
if
not
direct
and
rarely
wastes
words
on
this
occasion
he
certainly
lived
up
to
his
reputation
for
he
began
talking
before
he
was
fairly
in
the
room
my
dear
morris
he
said
i
have
called
to
talk
with
you
of
a
most
interesting
case
which
has
lately
come
under
my
observation
it
is
one
in
which
i
need
your
help
and
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
spare
the
time
to
assist
me
i
nodded
and
waved
him
to
a
chair
the
case
in
question
is
a
most
interesting
one
in
which
hypnotic
suggestion
may
or
may
not
be
an
important
factor
you
know
young
blake
the
son
of
the
late
mathew
blake
and
you
are
aware
that
he
has
been
rather
extravagant
in
his
habits
and
ways
of
living
and
although
not
exactly
a
spendthrift
undoubtedly
spends
more
money
than
he
ought
to
in
many
ways
the
great
trouble
with
him
is
his
passion
for
and
that
is
what
one
of
these
days
is
going
to
break
him
financially
unless
i
am
very
much
mistaken
just
now
young
blake
has
two
horses
entered
in
the
big
race
which
comes
off
day
after
at
eaton
park
one
of
his
horses
called
emperor
is
well
known
and
he
should
easily
win
the
race
he
is
by
far
the
best
horse
of
the
lot
and
has
been
selling
in
the
pools
for
two
to
one
against
the
field
the
other
horse
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
emperor
and
has
little
chance
of
being
placed
murphy
the
jockey
who
is
to
ride
emperor
is
one
of
the
best
on
the
turf
although
comparatively
a
young
boy
probably
about
nineteen
years
old
he
has
ridden
a
number
of
races
and
from
all
reports
is
a
lad
of
good
habits
and
seemingly
thoroughly
honest
young
blake
as
you
know
more
or
less
on
his
horses
when
they
run
whenever
he
thinks
they
have
a
fair
show
to
win
and
in
this
case
he
has
bet
a
great
deal
more
money
than
he
can
afford
to
lose
knowing
that
unless
the
horse
meets
with
some
unforeseen
accident
he
is
certain
to
win
the
race
as
i
understand
it
he
has
bet
so
much
money
that
if
by
any
chance
emperor
should
lose
the
race
it
would
seriously
hurt
young
blake
of
course
this
is
all
foolishness
from
our
standpoint
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
young
man
has
bet
this
money
and
that
any
accident
which
would
interfere
with
his
pulling
off
that
race
would
cause
him
serious
loss
knowing
his
father
as
i
did
i
have
taken
more
or
less
interest
in
the
boy
and
have
time
and
again
advised
him
to
let
racing
alone
and
settle
down
to
more
serious
life
i
should
not
have
taken
the
special
interest
in
this
particular
race
had
it
not
been
that
by
a
curious
coincidence
information
has
come
to
me
which
leads
me
to
suspect
that
everything
is
not
as
it
should
be
at
young
blake
stables
last
year
one
of
the
stable
boys
a
lad
by
the
name
of
collins
was
badly
injured
by
an
accident
and
young
blake
saw
that
he
was
nicely
taken
care
of
and
paid
him
a
salary
during
his
illness
the
youngster
was
grateful
and
the
other
day
it
seems
he
came
to
blake
and
told
him
that
murphy
the
jockey
who
is
to
ride
emperor
had
been
sleeping
badly
for
several
nights
and
talked
a
good
deal
in
his
sleep
about
the
horses
murphy
and
collins
sleep
together
in
the
room
over
the
stable
and
the
night
before
last
collins
was
awakened
by
hearing
murphy
call
out
to
some
one
and
then
say
distinctly
yes
i
understand
if
you
wave
your
handkerchief
i
am
to
emperor
if
you
do
not
wave
it
i
am
to
win
if
i
can
this
is
serious
business
the
boy
was
dreaming
of
course
but
why
did
he
dream
such
a
dream
the
idea
of
being
in
the
boy
mind
is
in
itself
enough
to
cause
serious
reflection
yesterday
young
blake
called
on
me
and
told
me
this
story
as
it
had
been
told
to
him
by
collins
collins
was
present
at
the
time
and
again
repeated
his
statement
declaring
positively
that
he
could
not
have
been
mistaken
in
the
words
spoken
by
murphy
in
his
sleep
and
that
the
boy
seemed
very
much
excited
blake
by
my
advice
sent
for
murphy
and
we
had
a
serious
conversation
with
him
the
boy
seemed
thoroughly
honest
and
was
very
much
hurt
upon
being
questioned
in
regard
to
the
matter
he
said
that
he
had
worked
for
blake
several
years
and
had
always
tried
to
do
right
that
he
intended
to
ride
his
best
and
win
the
race
if
he
could
blake
naturally
feels
somewhat
disturbed
under
the
circumstances
but
he
believes
the
boy
is
honest
and
he
believes
young
collins
must
in
some
way
have
been
mistaken
in
what
he
imagines
he
heard
or
if
he
was
not
mistaken
that
murphy
was
dreaming
and
the
words
had
no
significance
he
told
murphy
to
go
back
to
the
stables
and
that
he
would
trust
him
implicitly
stating
at
the
same
time
that
it
would
cause
him
serious
inconvenience
if
by
any
chance
murphy
should
not
win
as
he
had
bet
a
large
amount
of
money
on
the
result
murphy
with
tears
in
his
eyes
thanked
him
for
trusting
him
and
went
back
to
the
stables
afterwards
i
had
a
serious
conversation
with
collins
and
learned
that
on
two
occasions
he
had
seen
murphy
talking
with
a
strange
man
who
often
visited
the
track
upon
inquiry
we
have
learned
that
the
man
in
question
is
a
brother
of
a
man
who
married
murphy
sister
and
that
murphy
has
met
him
several
times
at
his
sister
house
the
man
name
is
simms
he
is
a
low
character
who
is
known
as
a
habitual
frequenter
of
the
race
track
and
who
at
times
does
business
as
a
poolseller
and
bookmaker
simms
is
described
as
being
thin
and
dark
with
a
big
scar
on
his
right
cheek
usually
wears
a
soft
hat
and
carries
a
cane
with
considerable
silver
about
the
handle
last
night
i
decided
to
have
an
interview
with
murphy
and
find
out
whether
the
lad
could
be
hypnotized
or
not
why
this
idea
suggested
itself
to
me
i
do
not
know
except
that
as
you
know
hypnotism
is
one
of
my
hobbies
with
blake
consent
i
sent
for
murphy
and
asked
him
to
let
me
look
him
over
as
i
would
like
to
assure
blake
as
to
his
physical
condition
as
naturally
he
was
feeling
as
i
told
him
somewhat
nervous
after
our
interview
of
the
morning
the
boy
consented
readily
enough
and
after
listening
to
his
heart
and
asking
him
a
few
questions
which
might
suggest
a
cause
for
his
restlessness
at
night
i
asked
him
to
look
at
me
fixedly
while
i
gently
stroked
his
forehead
above
the
eyes
with
my
hand
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
found
him
to
be
an
extremely
sensitive
hypnotic
subject
he
did
not
become
entirely
unconscious
but
was
in
a
peculiar
somnambulistic
condition
in
which
he
conversed
readily
enough
he
is
one
of
the
best
subjects
for
suggestion
that
i
have
ever
seen
i
tried
several
experiments
with
him
and
the
thought
occurred
to
me
if
it
was
not
possible
that
this
susceptibility
to
hypnotic
suggestion
might
be
used
by
unscrupulous
persons
in
many
ways
which
might
be
especially
dangerous
in
case
he
was
riding
a
good
horse
in
a
race
upon
questioning
murphy
after
i
had
awakened
him
regarding
his
susceptibility
to
hypnotic
influence
he
told
me
that
had
often
put
him
to
sleep
for
fun
when
they
met
at
his
sister
the
question
which
now
presents
itself
is
suppose
he
has
been
hypnotized
and
has
been
given
a
suggestion
that
he
is
to
emperor
if
a
certain
man
waves
his
handkerchief
how
are
we
to
prevent
his
carrying
out
these
instructions
of
course
we
can
take
the
boy
off
the
horse
and
put
on
another
jockey
but
blake
does
not
wish
to
do
this
in
his
waking
moments
murphy
does
not
remember
anything
that
has
been
told
him
while
hypnotized
and
i
doubt
if
we
could
make
blake
believe
that
there
was
any
real
danger
in
that
quarter
again
if
we
allow
him
to
go
in
and
ride
the
race
it
is
more
than
possible
that
he
could
be
made
to
win
or
lose
the
race
by
any
one
who
had
given
him
orders
while
in
a
hypnotic
condition
and
we
also
know
that
he
would
forget
entirely
that
he
had
received
such
orders
after
waking
now
the
difficulty
presents
itself
as
to
how
we
can
prevent
him
following
out
such
instructions
in
case
he
has
received
them
we
know
we
can
not
affect
such
suggestions
by
him
because
we
do
not
know
the
exact
circumstances
under
which
such
directions
were
given
to
merely
hypnotize
and
tell
him
he
is
not
to
carry
out
such
orders
would
have
no
effect
whatever
perhaps
if
we
could
tell
him
that
under
certain
described
circumstances
he
was
not
to
carry
out
such
orders
we
might
succeed
but
my
experience
has
been
that
the
directions
as
given
are
carried
out
by
the
subject
if
at
the
time
the
circumstance
described
which
is
to
be
recognized
as
a
signal
for
such
and
such
action
on
the
part
of
the
hypnotized
sensitive
occurs
is
for
instance
if
i
should
hypnotize
a
young
man
and
say
that
at
eight
when
he
hears
the
clock
strike
he
should
at
once
go
downstairs
and
get
a
glass
of
water
he
would
undoubtedly
do
it
when
the
clock
struck
eight
but
if
the
clock
did
not
strike
eight
supposing
some
one
had
removed
the
striker
and
when
near
the
hour
some
one
occupied
his
attention
so
that
he
did
not
notice
the
time
in
all
probability
he
would
not
obey
orders
it
requires
some
special
occurrence
which
has
been
described
in
connection
with
the
act
to
suggest
it
again
to
his
mind
in
my
opinion
the
best
we
can
do
is
to
let
murphy
ride
the
race
and
to
take
all
precautions
possible
to
prevent
any
man
waving
his
handkerchief
to
murphy
during
the
race
of
course
to
have
any
real
effect
on
the
race
the
person
waving
his
handkerchief
as
a
signal
for
murphy
to
emperor
must
do
so
far
enough
from
the
home
stretch
to
make
it
certain
that
emperor
can
be
prevented
from
winning
without
attracting
especial
attention
which
could
not
be
done
in
case
emperor
was
in
the
lead
if
the
signal
was
given
close
to
the
grand
stand
we
therefore
must
look
out
for
our
man
if
such
a
man
there
be
some
distance
down
the
now
if
you
will
go
to
the
track
with
me
we
will
station
ourselves
in
places
where
we
think
it
likely
that
such
a
person
would
stand
and
keep
a
sharp
watch
for
a
thin
dark
man
with
a
scar
on
his
cheek
will
you
join
me
i
assured
him
i
would
be
more
than
willing
to
do
so
as
i
was
very
much
interested
in
the
case
good
now
this
is
my
plan
i
shall
take
mike
falan
with
me
and
he
is
worth
half
a
dozen
men
in
the
case
of
a
row
i
have
also
engaged
three
private
detectives
to
be
on
the
watch
at
the
entrance
to
the
grand
stand
and
another
at
the
entrance
to
the
grounds
while
a
fifth
is
to
station
himself
at
the
side
of
the
track
and
do
sentinel
duty
about
the
post
with
orders
to
report
to
me
the
moment
simms
puts
in
an
appearance
and
to
have
him
shadowed
of
course
this
elaborate
plot
may
exist
only
in
my
imagination
but
if
as
i
believe
there
is
a
carefully
arranged
scheme
to
beat
blake
horse
we
shall
have
done
him
a
good
turn
and
perhaps
saved
him
a
lot
of
money
i
must
go
now
but
fail
to
meet
me
at
eleven
at
the
track
you
will
find
me
in
front
of
the
grand
stand
the
next
morning
when
i
arrived
at
the
track
i
found
watson
in
conversation
with
a
man
whom
he
introduced
to
me
as
mike
falan
we
walked
slowly
up
the
track
to
a
point
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
finish
there
was
a
great
crowd
of
people
present
the
numbers
had
gone
up
for
the
first
race
and
most
of
the
horses
were
already
out
and
warming
up
emperor
appeared
to
be
in
splendid
condition
as
he
galloped
easily
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
grand
stand
his
great
muscles
rolled
and
swelled
under
the
shiny
skin
and
he
looked
and
acted
like
a
horse
fit
to
race
for
his
life
he
was
a
prime
favorite
at
the
pools
and
was
selling
at
two
to
one
against
the
field
i
have
seen
blake
said
watson
and
he
is
feeling
confident
that
emperor
will
win
he
is
somewhat
nervous
of
course
but
he
tells
me
the
horse
is
in
shape
and
that
murphy
is
all
right
no
signs
of
simms
yet
and
the
race
will
be
started
in
less
than
ten
minutes
it
begins
to
look
as
though
i
have
been
frightened
at
a
shadow
at
this
moment
a
man
touched
watson
on
the
arm
and
whispered
something
to
him
and
then
moved
quickly
away
through
the
crowd
watson
started
and
turning
to
me
said
come
this
way
simms
is
here
he
is
down
the
track
below
the
gate
he
hurried
away
mike
and
i
following
and
upon
getting
clear
of
the
crowd
we
saw
a
man
leaning
against
the
picket
fence
which
separated
the
track
from
the
carriage
drive
watching
the
horses
through
a
small
as
we
came
up
simms
for
it
was
he
glanced
suspiciously
at
us
but
as
we
paid
no
attention
to
him
and
talked
earnestly
together
apparently
arguing
as
to
the
relative
merits
of
the
horses
he
soon
ceased
to
notice
us
and
turned
again
to
the
horses
hardly
had
he
done
so
when
he
hurriedly
put
the
glass
in
his
pocket
and
a
great
shout
from
the
grand
stand
and
cries
of
they
off
told
us
that
the
great
race
had
commenced
we
could
see
the
horses
far
off
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
track
all
running
in
a
bunch
until
they
neared
the
flag
when
two
were
seen
to
be
well
in
advance
of
the
others
as
they
swung
round
the
curve
we
could
see
the
red
cap
worn
by
murphy
flashing
in
the
sun
and
we
knew
that
emperor
was
leading
but
another
horse
a
deep
bay
the
jockey
dressed
completely
in
blue
was
very
close
to
him
on
they
came
and
watson
and
mike
edged
closer
and
closer
to
simms
whose
whole
attention
was
fixed
on
the
race
his
face
was
flushed
and
he
was
actually
dancing
with
excitement
we
watched
him
as
a
cat
watches
a
mouse
and
it
was
very
lucky
for
blake
that
we
did
so
the
horses
were
now
quite
near
us
and
we
could
see
murphy
plainly
and
noted
how
white
and
drawn
his
face
looked
suddenly
simms
pulled
a
large
white
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
but
as
he
did
so
the
doctor
snatched
it
from
his
hand
and
at
the
same
instant
mike
seized
him
in
his
powerful
arms
and
dragged
him
from
the
fence
mad
with
surprise
and
rage
he
struggled
and
kicked
like
a
wild
animal
damn
you
he
yelled
let
me
go
let
go
i
say
what
in
hell
do
you
mean
let
him
go
mike
said
the
doctor
mike
pushed
simms
from
him
and
he
staggered
back
against
the
fence
the
man
was
crazy
with
rage
and
i
believe
for
the
moment
he
was
really
insane
he
half
crouched
as
if
to
spring
at
us
snarling
and
showing
his
teeth
like
a
savage
dog
then
his
hand
went
to
his
hip
pocket
i
would
try
that
if
i
were
you
simms
said
watson
quietly
you
will
get
the
worst
of
it
if
you
do
watson
right
hand
was
in
the
pocket
of
his
and
his
eyes
said
i
shoot
as
plainly
as
if
he
had
told
simms
so
in
so
many
words
see
here
you
cried
mike
if
you
pull
a
gun
i
smash
your
jaw
simms
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
with
the
expression
of
a
madman
his
face
was
ghastly
white
and
the
scar
on
his
cheek
stood
out
livid
in
contrast
with
the
white
skin
i
thought
for
a
moment
he
was
about
to
draw
his
revolver
but
suddenly
he
turned
and
ran
toward
the
crowd
and
in
a
moment
was
lost
to
our
view
the
shouting
and
cheering
still
kept
up
and
as
we
hurried
toward
the
grand
stand
watson
asked
a
man
which
horse
had
won
emperor
by
a
length
a
great
race
we
found
blake
in
front
of
the
stand
he
came
to
us
and
shook
hands
his
face
was
beaming
with
the
joy
of
success
do
you
know
he
said
i
do
believe
that
something
is
the
matter
with
murphy
he
was
as
pale
as
a
ghost
after
the
race
he
said
he
could
remember
nothing
about
it
until
he
found
himself
in
the
home
stretch
running
neck
and
neck
with
nettie
b
then
he
seemed
to
wake
from
a
dream
and
sat
down
and
rode
emperor
for
all
he
was
worth
you
know
the
rest
he
won
out
all
right
but
i
tell
you
it
was
a
confounded
sight
too
close
for
comfort
the
strange
powder
of
the
jou
jou
priests
watson
carefully
opened
the
little
antique
silver
box
which
was
about
the
size
and
shape
of
an
ordinary
watch
and
showed
that
it
contained
a
gray
powder
and
a
little
gold
measure
resembling
a
miniature
thimble
it
was
evidently
very
old
the
cover
being
worn
smooth
in
many
places
nearly
effacing
the
peculiar
hieroglyphics
with
which
it
had
once
been
engraved
i
consider
this
he
said
my
my
exhibit
as
it
were
the
powder
possesses
such
wonderful
properties
and
is
so
unlike
any
known
drug
that
i
hesitate
to
describe
its
effects
that
it
is
a
powerful
poison
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
when
taken
in
small
doses
it
is
apparently
harmless
enough
what
is
its
history
asked
farrington
i
picked
it
up
in
london
got
it
from
burridge
the
explorer
who
had
just
returned
from
a
year
trip
in
the
interior
of
west
africa
he
went
into
benin
city
with
the
english
when
they
cleaned
out
the
town
burridge
says
he
took
it
from
a
dead
jou
jou
priest
and
he
made
me
pay
a
pretty
stiff
price
for
it
it
is
a
wonderful
drug
entirely
unknown
outside
of
africa
burridge
thinks
it
is
made
from
the
leaves
of
some
plant
but
its
preparation
is
a
secret
of
the
priests
of
jou
jou
now
i
propose
that
we
each
take
a
small
quantity
of
the
powder
and
then
dine
together
evening
and
compare
notes
i
may
as
well
tell
you
now
it
produces
strange
hallucinations
i
tried
it
once
myself
and
my
experience
on
that
occasion
was
to
say
the
least
peculiar
therefore
i
am
more
than
anxious
to
try
it
again
and
compare
notes
with
you
afterwards
and
i
think
i
can
promise
you
a
new
and
novel
experience
farrington
and
forster
were
perfectly
willing
to
try
the
experiment
which
watson
hinted
promised
such
interesting
results
and
it
was
agreed
that
each
should
take
a
dose
of
the
powder
before
retiring
and
meet
together
the
next
evening
promptly
at
the
time
appointed
the
three
men
met
in
watson
study
and
after
cigars
had
been
lighted
watson
asked
farrington
to
be
the
first
to
relate
his
experience
whereupon
the
doctor
drew
from
his
pocket
several
pages
of
closely
written
manuscript
and
began
as
follows
an
aztec
mummy
farrington
story
i
was
standing
in
a
museum
looking
at
a
case
of
mummies
one
of
them
was
marked
mummy
of
an
aztec
found
in
a
cliff
dwelling
and
it
interested
me
very
much
in
size
it
was
that
of
a
small
man
and
was
in
a
fine
state
of
preservation
with
the
exception
that
the
bones
of
the
legs
were
exposed
and
more
or
less
disintegrated
in
some
places
the
hands
even
to
the
finger
nails
were
perfect
however
and
there
was
a
silver
ring
on
the
index
finger
one
hand
grasped
a
large
stone
axe
the
handle
being
modern
the
right
hand
rested
across
the
chest
clasping
a
necklace
of
silver
wire
interesting
specimen
is
it
not
said
a
voice
at
my
side
quite
so
i
replied
but
i
doubt
if
it
is
really
an
aztec
mummy
what
makes
you
think
that
asked
the
voice
sharply
because
i
do
believe
the
aztecs
buried
their
dead
in
cliff
dwellings
however
it
is
an
interesting
mummy
and
in
a
wonderful
state
of
preservation
i
was
so
interested
in
examining
the
mummy
that
i
had
spoken
without
turning
my
head
now
however
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
tall
gaunt
figure
of
a
man
dressed
in
a
suit
of
corduroy
and
wearing
a
hat
or
sombrero
such
as
is
generally
worn
on
the
western
plains
well
he
remarked
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
pretty
good
mummy
i
made
it
myself
and
ought
to
know
excuse
me
what
did
you
say
i
asked
thinking
i
had
not
understood
him
aright
i
said
that
was
one
of
my
mummies
what
do
you
mean
by
that
sir
i
asked
you
will
understand
when
i
tell
you
i
was
a
dealer
in
curiosities
and
during
my
time
i
furnished
museums
with
a
great
many
interesting
and
valuable
specimens
when
trade
was
slow
i
occasionally
helped
nature
a
little
but
that
is
all
over
now
have
you
given
up
the
business
i
asked
had
to
but
perhaps
you
do
not
know
that
i
am
dead
answered
my
companion
fell
from
a
cliff
last
year
and
broke
my
neck
did
you
indeed
i
answered
trying
to
appear
interested
that
what
i
did
but
let
me
tell
you
about
that
mummy
there
was
a
scientific
chap
who
came
to
our
place
and
wanted
to
buy
aztec
relics
me
and
my
partner
made
a
trade
with
him
and
sold
him
a
lot
of
stuff
but
he
was
very
anxious
to
be
taken
where
he
could
dig
some
up
for
himself
be
sure
of
the
authenticity
and
antiquity
of
the
relics
well
me
and
my
pard
figured
up
that
it
might
be
to
our
advantage
to
take
him
to
a
good
cliff
dwelling
and
we
arranged
that
he
should
pay
us
so
much
for
everything
he
dug
up
if
he
found
a
mummy
we
got
one
hundred
dollars
if
stone
hatchets
and
axes
two
dollars
each
ten
cents
each
for
stone
and
grinders
one
dollar
each
taking
them
as
they
came
and
whole
pottery
five
dollars
where
did
you
find
the
mummy
did
you
know
of
the
cave
i
asked
well
we
knew
where
there
were
lots
of
caves
and
where
there
were
indian
graveyards
with
the
aid
of
a
little
stain
and
judicious
arrangement
of
a
body
we
prepared
a
fine
aztec
mummy
of
course
we
used
the
body
of
an
indian
one
who
had
been
dead
for
a
long
time
and
was
dried
up
and
crumbly
my
partner
was
a
clever
chap
and
he
fixed
up
the
axe
and
the
silver
necklace
and
we
took
the
outfit
and
started
for
the
verde
cañon
we
picked
out
a
cave
and
dug
a
hole
in
the
floor
in
which
we
carefully
placed
the
mummy
and
covered
him
up
with
dry
dust
then
we
wet
the
clay
over
him
leaving
the
floor
hard
and
smooth
as
before
we
also
buried
about
fifty
axes
and
two
or
three
hundred
and
half
a
dozen
nice
specimens
of
indian
pottery
which
we
burned
up
good
and
black
after
we
had
the
cave
to
our
satisfaction
we
partly
sealed
up
the
entrance
and
returned
to
flagstaff
was
that
acting
quite
fair
fair
why
how
do
you
think
that
poor
man
would
have
felt
if
he
had
come
all
the
way
out
to
arizona
and
gone
to
all
the
expense
of
his
and
outfit
and
then
found
nothing
it
was
philanthropy
my
dear
sir
the
height
of
philanthropy
was
he
pleased
with
the
mummy
pleased
why
bless
your
dear
innocent
soul
he
screamed
with
joy
like
a
child
when
we
accidentally
discovered
a
piece
of
a
toe
while
digging
in
the
bottom
of
the
cave
he
dropped
on
his
knees
and
removed
every
particle
of
dirt
with
his
hands
and
almost
cried
over
it
he
carried
on
so
that
my
partner
nearly
gave
us
away
he
was
a
chump
about
some
things
if
anything
pleased
him
he
would
laugh
and
his
laugh
sounded
like
the
bray
of
a
jackass
well
sir
when
this
scientific
chap
got
down
on
his
knees
and
commenced
to
paw
the
earth
away
from
the
fake
mummy
my
partner
began
to
gurgle
i
knew
what
was
coming
and
punched
him
in
the
ribs
but
it
did
no
good
the
scientific
chap
looked
up
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
shouted
my
pard
and
then
he
roared
and
yelled
and
howled
a
look
of
doubt
and
annoyance
came
into
our
victim
eyes
but
pard
saved
himself
just
in
time
he
yelled
between
his
paroxysms
of
laughter
at
that
buzzard
over
there
i
damned
if
he
ai
the
funniest
buzzard
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
and
then
he
roared
and
yelled
and
jumped
about
at
him
he
laughed
him
fly
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
funny
i
am
not
sure
but
what
the
scientist
thought
he
was
crazy
but
anyhow
he
did
catch
on
to
what
he
was
laughing
at
and
pretty
soon
went
on
with
his
digging
we
stayed
there
three
days
and
dug
the
whole
place
up
and
took
back
with
us
a
basket
full
of
stone
axes
three
large
prehistoric
vases
and
the
mummy
he
drove
the
wagon
himself
every
step
of
the
way
for
fear
something
would
get
broken
and
when
we
got
to
flagstaff
he
spent
two
days
packing
the
relics
do
you
consider
that
sort
of
thing
quite
honorable
i
asked
honorable
what
is
that
you
say
you
dude
now
my
boy
do
get
fresh
with
me
just
because
i
am
dead
and
ca
jump
you
i
hastened
to
pacify
him
well
that
all
right
but
if
you
had
said
that
to
me
last
year
when
i
was
alive
i
would
have
marked
squares
all
over
your
body
with
a
piece
of
chalk
and
then
played
on
you
i
meant
no
offence
i
said
humbly
maybe
you
did
but
just
you
make
another
break
like
that
and
i
wo
forget
it
you
will
have
to
die
sometime
and
then
oh
mamma
is
your
partner
dead
i
asked
no
jim
is
not
dead
by
a
long
shot
i
went
down
to
see
him
last
winter
at
his
place
in
california
where
he
has
opened
up
a
new
store
he
has
a
good
tourist
trade
made
a
lot
of
money
this
year
out
of
mermaids
and
there
was
a
run
on
this
winter
he
makes
them
out
of
fishes
the
mermaids
he
makes
out
of
fishes
tails
and
indian
children
robs
the
graveyards
you
know
some
of
them
are
really
fine
and
artistic
i
tell
you
he
is
an
artist
in
his
line
he
has
a
branch
store
still
somewhere
in
new
mexico
and
made
a
stack
of
money
last
winter
in
navajo
blankets
and
indian
arms
and
shields
it
is
the
scalp
trimming
which
catches
the
tourist
he
gets
most
of
his
scalps
from
california
from
hospitals
there
but
when
he
is
short
horse
hair
does
pretty
well
especially
for
old
indian
scalps
and
then
navajo
blankets
holy
smoke
a
gold
mine
is
in
it
they
make
them
of
germantown
wool
and
aniline
dyes
and
they
cost
at
the
factory
all
the
way
from
six
bits
to
and
sell
to
the
tourist
for
various
prices
sometimes
as
high
as
or
oh
i
tell
you
he
is
shrewd
some
day
he
will
be
worth
a
million
sometimes
a
chap
goes
into
his
shop
and
poses
as
an
expert
those
are
the
kind
of
jays
that
fill
jim
soul
with
joy
the
fellow
will
pull
over
a
pile
of
blankets
and
after
looking
at
them
wisely
will
say
you
got
any
real
good
blankets
these
are
germantown
wool
and
mineral
dyes
then
jim
will
say
i
see
you
know
something
about
blankets
yes
a
little
answers
the
expert
fine
blankets
are
mighty
hard
to
get
now
remarks
jim
know
they
are
remarks
the
wise
tourist
still
they
are
to
be
had
sometimes
are
they
not
come
now
have
you
got
something
choice
hidden
away
then
jim
will
look
about
as
though
fearful
that
somebody
might
see
him
and
will
steal
softly
into
a
back
room
and
pull
from
beneath
his
bed
a
good
cheap
blanket
worth
about
and
spread
it
out
lovingly
in
front
of
the
tourist
he
whispers
at
that
that
is
not
for
sale
i
am
keeping
that
for
myself
but
i
thought
you
would
like
to
see
it
as
it
is
very
evident
you
know
a
good
deal
about
blankets
is
it
a
beauty
then
the
tourist
and
asks
him
what
it
is
worth
and
admires
it
agrees
with
him
as
to
the
splendid
old
dyes
and
fine
preservation
of
the
native
wool
prepared
in
the
manner
of
the
old
navajo
speaks
of
its
great
rarity
and
at
last
ends
by
asking
jim
what
he
will
take
for
it
and
usually
carries
it
away
with
him
having
paid
three
or
four
times
the
value
of
a
really
good
blanket
i
seen
jim
pull
their
legs
so
hard
they
pretty
near
limp
when
they
went
out
ah
those
were
happy
days
the
departed
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
gazed
silently
at
his
handiwork
well
he
said
i
must
be
going
i
have
a
lot
of
things
i
want
to
do
before
morning
but
hope
to
run
across
you
sometime
again
glad
you
like
the
mummy
i
forgot
to
mention
that
most
of
the
teeth
were
gone
when
we
first
got
it
and
jim
put
in
a
fine
new
set
and
improved
it
a
whole
lot
i
glanced
at
the
mummy
and
when
i
looked
up
again
my
companion
had
disappeared
a
lesson
in
chemistry
forster
story
i
took
the
powder
as
agreed
and
sat
down
to
read
the
evening
paper
before
retiring
with
the
result
that
i
did
not
retire
at
all
i
became
much
interested
in
an
article
on
new
explosives
with
which
the
government
has
been
lately
experimenting
and
had
nearly
finished
it
when
i
heard
a
voice
say
to
me
interesting
subject
is
it
i
turned
and
saw
seated
on
my
lounge
a
man
his
clothes
seemed
to
be
all
run
in
together
you
could
make
out
the
outlines
of
the
man
but
the
figure
was
not
clear
sort
of
foggy
you
know
what
surprised
me
most
was
that
i
could
look
right
through
him
and
see
that
back
of
the
lounge
i
said
to
myself
is
this
a
dream
or
the
effect
of
the
powder
i
have
taken
and
i
pinched
my
leg
and
rubbed
my
eyes
but
although
i
seemed
to
be
perfectly
wide
awake
the
shape
did
not
disappear
what
did
you
say
i
asked
i
remarked
that
the
subject
of
high
explosives
was
decidedly
interesting
answered
the
shape
i
was
a
chemist
when
alive
but
it
makes
me
sad
to
think
how
very
little
i
really
knew
chemistry
as
well
as
other
branches
of
science
has
made
great
strides
during
the
past
generation
since
my
day
but
even
now
they
really
know
very
little
but
i
answered
it
seems
to
me
the
high
explosives
which
we
now
have
are
sufficiently
powerful
if
we
knew
how
to
use
them
with
safety
that
it
answered
the
shape
now
i
have
a
couple
of
hours
to
spare
and
if
it
would
interest
you
and
you
care
to
come
over
to
my
laboratory
i
will
be
happy
to
give
you
one
or
two
points
which
may
prove
of
value
to
you
i
say
to
my
laboratory
but
it
really
is
not
mine
i
use
any
laboratory
that
is
handiest
and
i
know
most
of
the
good
ones
in
the
city
you
see
i
do
not
need
to
have
a
key
to
enter
a
room
that
is
one
of
the
great
advantages
we
have
as
you
will
discover
one
of
these
days
just
now
i
can
get
you
in
very
well
because
the
owner
of
the
laboratory
to
which
we
will
go
is
out
of
town
i
will
go
in
first
and
unlock
the
door
for
you
i
told
him
that
i
should
be
most
happy
to
accept
his
invitation
it
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
be
conversing
with
a
ghost
and
to
have
him
invite
me
to
go
to
somebody
laboratory
and
use
up
his
chemicals
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
not
be
considered
quite
good
form
we
went
out
of
my
rooms
and
downstairs
the
shadow
floating
alongside
of
me
in
the
most
friendly
manner
possible
i
could
see
by
the
position
of
his
body
that
he
had
hold
of
my
arm
but
his
fingers
did
not
show
on
my
we
went
up
town
for
perhaps
half
a
mile
and
entered
a
large
brick
building
in
which
i
noted
were
various
studios
it
was
dark
but
going
up
three
flights
of
stairs
my
guide
opened
a
door
and
ushered
me
into
a
large
and
extensively
furnished
laboratory
evidently
belonging
to
some
scientific
man
of
means
and
experience
the
ghost
turned
the
button
of
the
electric
light
and
then
motioned
me
to
a
seat
my
time
he
said
is
somewhat
limited
because
i
have
an
appointment
with
a
lady
at
twelve
but
i
will
show
you
what
a
high
explosive
really
is
and
then
if
we
have
time
we
will
talk
of
something
else
the
difficulty
about
high
explosives
is
not
in
making
them
but
in
using
them
after
they
are
made
you
create
a
gigantic
power
which
you
do
not
know
how
to
handle
the
rather
modern
discovery
of
how
to
make
liquid
air
has
simplified
matters
a
good
deal
when
you
can
make
liquid
hydrogen
in
quantities
you
will
have
a
still
better
agent
for
many
purposes
now
let
us
take
a
little
of
this
liquid
air
you
see
it
pours
like
water
as
i
happen
to
know
our
absent
host
has
nearly
two
gallons
of
it
or
had
this
afternoon
some
of
it
has
evaporated
but
as
you
see
there
is
still
more
than
a
gallon
left
and
we
will
not
steal
much
as
all
we
want
for
our
experiment
to
illustrate
to
you
the
greatest
explosive
which
can
be
manufactured
is
about
as
much
liquid
air
as
you
can
hold
in
a
thimble
do
you
propose
to
try
your
explosive
here
i
hesitated
by
the
way
what
is
your
name
oh
call
me
any
old
name
it
does
not
matter
mr
spook
shall
we
say
ahem
a
little
personal
perhaps
but
it
will
do
as
well
as
another
now
as
i
was
saying
i
will
show
you
how
to
make
the
most
powerful
explosive
that
was
ever
invented
it
is
possible
that
i
did
not
show
as
much
interest
and
enthusiasm
as
he
expected
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
a
little
nervous
spooks
do
not
have
the
same
interest
in
being
careful
in
their
experiments
an
accident
or
two
is
of
little
consequence
to
them
but
might
be
decidedly
disagreeable
to
me
i
may
have
shown
something
of
what
i
was
thinking
in
my
manner
for
spook
looked
at
me
keenly
what
is
the
matter
you
do
not
appear
interested
on
the
contrary
i
answered
i
am
deeply
so
but
do
we
not
run
considerable
risk
in
trying
such
experiments
in
a
laboratory
without
the
consent
of
its
owner
not
at
all
not
at
all
i
will
use
a
very
small
amount
of
the
explosive
and
there
will
be
no
damage
done
have
you
attempted
to
make
it
before
mr
spook
i
ventured
oh
yes
last
week
that
was
a
mistake
you
see
now
i
know
all
about
it
i
did
then
the
explosion
was
something
awful
it
blew
the
building
pretty
much
all
to
pieces
if
i
had
been
alive
i
do
believe
you
could
have
found
a
piece
of
me
as
large
as
your
finger
they
called
it
spontaneous
combustion
however
we
wo
have
anything
of
that
kind
please
do
i
answered
no
i
promise
you
now
we
will
take
a
little
of
this
red
phosphorus
ordinary
phosphorus
will
not
answer
and
pour
a
little
liquid
air
on
it
stirring
it
gently
as
you
see
now
if
i
should
let
that
dry
it
would
explode
at
the
slightest
touch
but
we
do
not
want
that
and
we
wish
to
increase
its
power
so
we
add
a
little
chloride
of
potassium
now
watch
it
dry
see
the
color
change
to
a
light
there
if
you
should
strike
that
or
put
fire
to
it
it
would
wreck
this
building
as
completely
as
if
you
had
exploded
fifty
pounds
of
dynamite
in
it
i
drew
away
from
the
table
instinctively
have
no
fear
i
will
not
explode
it
now
watch
me
closely
i
will
ignite
a
minute
quantity
about
as
much
as
would
make
the
head
of
a
small
black
pin
or
a
no
see
the
rest
we
will
put
in
this
pail
of
water
there
now
all
is
ready
here
goes
he
lit
a
match
and
touched
the
little
brown
dot
a
tremendous
explosion
followed
and
the
wooden
table
was
split
into
pieces
the
sound
was
so
terrific
and
the
shock
so
unexpected
that
i
was
dizzy
and
frightened
great
heavens
i
exclaimed
you
have
broken
everything
in
the
laboratory
no
replied
the
ghost
rather
shamefacedly
not
so
bad
as
that
but
i
afraid
that
i
have
ruined
the
table
and
cracked
a
few
things
however
i
will
be
more
careful
next
time
it
is
even
more
powerful
than
i
thought
what
do
you
suppose
would
be
the
effect
on
a
warship
if
struck
with
a
shell
containing
one
hundred
pounds
of
that
stuff
i
answered
that
she
would
be
destroyed
destroyed
i
should
say
she
would
the
largest
battleship
would
be
blown
to
atoms
the
spook
glanced
at
an
dutch
clock
in
the
corner
of
the
laboratory
fine
clock
that
glad
i
did
break
it
with
our
little
racket
just
now
i
see
i
have
nearly
an
hour
to
spare
is
there
any
experiment
you
would
like
to
try
i
said
anything
would
interest
me
but
that
i
did
care
for
any
more
explosives
i
suppose
you
know
how
to
make
diamonds
do
you
i
answered
that
for
years
men
had
tried
to
manufacture
diamonds
but
practically
without
success
that
as
far
as
i
was
aware
they
had
only
succeeded
in
making
them
so
small
as
to
be
practically
of
no
use
commercially
and
the
expense
of
the
manufacture
was
far
in
excess
of
their
value
that
all
right
answered
the
spook
but
really
it
is
a
very
simple
matter
here
i
will
make
a
diamond
for
you
he
walked
across
the
room
to
the
fireplace
and
taking
from
the
grate
a
lump
of
coal
about
the
size
of
a
billiard
ball
he
laid
it
upon
the
table
this
he
said
is
nearly
pure
carbon
and
as
you
are
well
aware
it
is
practically
what
a
diamond
is
now
i
will
illustrate
to
you
how
you
may
make
a
diamond
from
this
piece
of
coal
which
will
be
as
good
as
any
diamond
ever
found
in
the
mines
we
will
manufacture
it
instead
of
letting
nature
do
it
we
will
first
place
it
in
this
glass
bowl
and
pour
over
it
sufficient
liquid
air
to
cover
it
completely
we
will
let
it
remain
until
it
is
thoroughly
cold
say
at
least
below
zero
there
now
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
heat
it
and
then
subject
it
to
a
powerful
great
gee
hosiphat
five
minutes
to
twelve
i
must
go
appointment
with
a
lady
at
twelve
but
i
say
old
fellow
just
hold
it
under
the
blowpipe
and
get
it
hot
just
as
hot
as
you
can
i
will
be
back
soon
his
last
words
came
to
me
faintly
through
the
window
he
had
already
floated
out
i
took
the
piece
of
coal
and
began
heating
it
under
the
blowpipe
it
did
not
burn
as
i
thought
it
would
but
turned
red
and
then
white
gradually
it
seemed
to
grow
larger
and
larger
and
brighter
and
brighter
until
i
opened
my
eyes
and
found
myself
in
bed
with
the
sun
shining
full
upon
me
through
the
open
window
an
interesting
ghost
watson
story
it
is
with
the
greatest
difficulty
said
watson
that
i
force
myself
to
believe
that
what
i
am
about
to
relate
to
you
did
not
actually
happen
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
as
as
i
am
at
this
present
moment
and
impossible
that
the
strange
series
of
incidents
could
be
due
entirely
to
mental
disturbances
i
went
home
and
went
to
bed
after
first
taking
the
powder
and
i
think
i
went
to
sleep
how
long
i
slept
i
do
not
know
but
i
was
startled
at
finding
myself
floating
about
the
room
with
much
the
same
feeling
as
one
has
when
floating
in
water
only
it
was
without
effort
my
motion
seemed
to
be
governed
entirely
by
my
will
if
i
glanced
at
anything
in
the
room
i
would
float
towards
it
imagine
my
astonishment
at
seeing
my
body
lying
in
the
bed
apparently
sound
asleep
you
will
admit
the
sensation
was
novel
to
say
the
least
after
floating
around
the
room
two
or
three
times
enjoying
the
peculiar
sensation
i
began
to
wonder
what
they
had
been
doing
at
the
hospital
during
my
absence
immediately
i
found
myself
in
the
hospital
ward
ford
and
two
nurses
were
standing
by
a
cot
at
the
north
end
and
glancing
at
the
chart
on
the
table
i
saw
the
patient
was
seriously
moribund
said
a
voice
i
afraid
so
i
answered
i
turned
and
saw
an
elderly
gentleman
dressed
in
the
costume
of
the
last
century
floating
beside
me
sad
is
it
not
people
still
die
i
see
in
spite
of
the
wonderful
advance
in
the
science
of
medicine
since
my
day
were
you
a
doctor
when
alive
i
asked
well
i
was
called
one
and
received
the
regular
license
to
kill
or
cure
i
regret
to
say
that
i
have
since
learned
that
i
killed
a
great
many
more
than
i
cured
the
trouble
is
after
you
are
dead
your
patients
know
this
as
well
as
you
do
and
say
unkind
things
even
i
received
word
from
a
former
patient
of
mine
and
a
ghost
who
ought
to
know
better
to
the
effect
that
he
intended
to
hunt
me
up
and
punch
my
head
i
treated
him
for
renal
colic
and
he
died
of
appendicitis
what
sort
of
a
death
certificate
did
you
give
i
asked
heart
disease
and
let
me
tell
you
that
was
a
great
deal
nearer
to
it
than
some
of
you
chaps
get
nowadays
you
are
not
complimentary
i
said
coldly
perhaps
not
but
if
you
think
my
criticisms
harsh
and
uncalled
for
let
us
get
down
to
cold
facts
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
how
very
few
people
live
to
be
even
one
hundred
and
years
old
you
surely
will
admit
that
there
is
no
reason
why
a
man
should
not
live
to
that
age
barring
accidents
we
know
that
in
bible
times
there
were
lots
of
old
fellows
who
passed
their
three
hundredth
birthday
and
a
chap
named
methuselah
claimed
to
be
nine
hundred
and
years
old
nine
hundred
and
was
it
not
i
asked
perhaps
you
are
right
but
or
i
am
inclined
to
be
a
little
sceptical
about
that
record
myself
there
is
one
thing
in
its
favor
however
and
that
is
that
he
made
it
an
even
nine
hundred
and
and
not
one
thousand
of
course
you
know
there
are
plenty
of
people
living
who
are
over
one
hundred
years
old
and
some
who
have
reached
the
very
satisfactory
age
of
one
hundred
and
most
of
them
however
live
in
bulgaria
mexico
or
some
place
and
are
so
poor
that
they
have
to
live
abstemiously
then
you
consider
the
secret
of
longevity
to
be
a
matter
of
diet
said
i
partly
that
and
partly
proper
care
of
the
nervous
system
but
come
downstairs
and
let
us
have
a
cigarette
i
am
dying
for
a
smoke
we
floated
down
to
the
office
which
happened
to
be
unoccupied
at
the
time
the
medical
ghost
helped
himself
to
a
cigarette
from
a
trayful
on
the
and
lighting
it
he
seated
himself
in
an
armchair
and
puffed
away
with
evident
enjoyment
i
noticed
the
smoke
which
he
inhaled
continually
oozed
from
all
parts
of
his
body
illustration
the
smoke
continually
oozed
from
all
parts
of
his
body
my
dear
fellow
he
said
impressively
you
must
understand
that
all
diseases
are
caused
by
germs
microscopic
bugs
and
plants
you
know
many
of
them
so
small
that
they
are
invisible
to
an
ordinary
microscope
or
if
seen
at
all
are
not
recognized
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
them
and
each
and
every
one
has
its
mission
in
life
and
preys
upon
and
destroys
other
germs
now
the
human
body
is
constantly
getting
a
lot
of
germs
inside
of
it
which
do
not
belong
there
some
are
taken
in
by
the
lungs
while
floating
in
the
air
some
by
the
stomach
by
the
food
and
drink
some
by
the
skin
etc
these
germs
are
met
by
their
natural
enemies
which
live
in
blood
his
as
it
were
and
are
destroyed
but
if
the
attacking
army
is
very
large
or
from
some
reason
the
home
army
has
been
weakened
and
decimated
then
the
invaders
flourish
establish
themselves
and
wax
powerful
and
strong
and
the
man
becomes
what
is
called
come
he
said
rising
abruptly
and
throwing
the
unconsumed
end
of
his
cigarette
into
the
fireplace
come
with
me
to
the
laboratory
and
i
will
show
you
in
about
two
minutes
more
than
i
could
explain
if
i
talked
for
years
and
a
great
deal
more
satisfactorily
we
floated
down
to
the
laboratory
and
the
ghost
took
from
the
shelf
a
bottle
and
held
it
up
to
the
light
here
he
said
we
have
a
culture
you
of
course
understand
how
the
germs
of
disease
are
cultivated
for
experimental
use
it
is
needless
for
me
to
explain
to
you
that
certain
media
are
used
for
these
cultures
such
as
milk
etc
here
we
have
the
germ
of
diphtheria
here
of
tuberculosis
here
of
typhoid
fever
etc
that
little
short
jar
over
yonder
contains
some
cholera
bacilli
which
have
been
lately
sent
here
now
look
at
this
typhoid
germ
if
we
took
a
drop
of
healthy
blood
and
put
some
of
these
typhoid
germs
in
it
how
they
would
wiggle
but
if
the
drop
of
blood
was
from
a
typhoid
patient
they
wo
wiggle
very
long
as
you
know
see
this
chap
which
we
have
to
stain
to
see
properly
even
with
this
wonderful
microscope
that
is
our
old
friend
the
bacillus
of
tuberculosis
but
unless
you
see
the
patient
first
i
do
not
believe
you
could
distinguish
him
from
the
leprosy
bug
these
are
known
germs
but
look
through
the
glass
at
this
drop
and
you
will
see
some
bugs
worth
seeing
although
the
medical
fraternity
have
not
as
yet
discovered
their
value
perhaps
you
know
that
most
bacteriologists
consider
these
germs
to
be
plants
not
bugs
although
they
admit
some
of
them
move
a
little
how
astonished
they
would
be
if
they
could
look
through
this
glass
see
that
chap
with
green
hind
legs
he
preys
on
the
typhoid
germ
and
when
they
discover
this
physicians
will
simply
inoculate
the
patient
with
a
lot
of
these
little
chaps
with
the
green
legs
and
they
will
do
the
rest
here
is
a
germ
with
yellow
stripes
which
looks
a
little
like
a
diminutive
potato
bug
he
is
the
deadly
enemy
of
the
bug
of
consumption
and
will
attack
and
kill
him
on
every
possible
occasion
they
are
about
evenly
matched
but
i
think
the
little
striped
chap
is
a
bit
the
better
another
ghost
and
myself
made
a
match
the
other
night
seven
battles
the
result
to
decide
the
championship
a
sort
of
a
bugging
main
as
it
were
i
won
the
first
six
matches
were
even
we
won
three
each
but
in
the
seventh
my
striped
bug
got
the
tubercular
germ
down
and
shook
him
as
a
terrier
does
a
rat
the
other
ghost
and
myself
nearly
had
a
fight
to
get
our
eyes
to
the
microscope
i
tell
you
it
was
exciting
there
is
my
champion
bug
now
see
him
the
one
with
the
fourth
hind
leg
gone
but
how
i
asked
are
you
going
to
prevent
people
from
dying
of
old
age
of
course
they
will
die
of
old
age
but
there
is
no
such
thing
as
old
age
under
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
what
you
call
old
age
is
not
old
age
at
all
there
are
two
kinds
of
old
age
or
senility
old
age
properly
speaking
results
from
a
distinct
modification
of
the
nervous
tissues
and
a
hardening
of
the
arteries
the
former
caused
by
unnatural
conditions
nervous
strain
and
dissipation
and
the
latter
from
and
drinking
the
trouble
with
the
ordinary
man
is
that
he
absorbs
great
quantities
of
nitrogenous
foods
instead
of
making
his
diet
one
of
nuts
fruit
milk
etc
in
comparatively
young
men
of
the
present
age
there
is
often
a
decided
modification
of
the
nervous
tissues
with
symptoms
resembling
those
in
neurasthenia
in
such
cases
galvanic
treatment
will
restore
the
centres
to
their
normal
condition
you
will
therefore
i
think
admit
that
with
proper
diet
and
possibly
the
aid
of
a
galvanic
battery
a
man
may
live
barring
possible
death
by
violence
say
two
hundred
years
you
mean
i
said
when
we
have
learned
to
combat
the
various
disease
germs
by
pitting
against
them
their
natural
enemies
exactly
of
course
answered
the
shade
but
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
talked
long
enough
i
am
becoming
very
dry
so
let
us
repair
to
the
waldorf
and
have
a
cocktail
how
is
it
possible
i
asked
that
you
can
take
a
cocktail
there
being
nothing
tangible
about
you
of
course
answered
the
ghost
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
actually
drink
a
cocktail
i
can
however
float
over
the
bar
and
inhale
the
pleasing
odors
arising
from
the
various
concoctions
served
to
the
guests
and
in
my
ethereal
condition
i
enjoy
the
odors
and
am
affected
by
them
as
much
as
if
i
were
really
drinking
the
liquid
we
floated
from
the
house
and
down
town
until
we
reached
the
brilliantly
lighted
waldorf
hotel
there
were
many
people
in
the
and
the
medical
shade
and
myself
floating
about
over
the
different
tables
inhaled
with
decided
enjoyment
the
delicate
aroma
of
the
various
mixed
drinks
so
dear
to
the
present
generation
to
my
annoyance
my
shade
companion
soon
began
to
sing
he
was
evidently
affected
by
the
odors
which
had
passed
through
him
his
manner
became
familiar
and
i
had
great
difficulty
in
keeping
him
from
kicking
the
glasses
off
the
tables
at
last
i
succeeded
in
getting
him
out
of
the
room
and
it
was
time
for
as
we
floated
into
the
street
he
began
shouting
in
a
most
uproarious
manner
and
i
was
afraid
that
we
should
be
arrested
for
disturbing
the
peace
be
quiet
i
beg
of
you
i
pleaded
see
that
policeman
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
we
shall
surely
get
into
trouble
if
you
make
such
a
noise
policeman
hiccoughed
the
shade
what
the
devil
do
i
care
for
a
policeman
watch
me
go
over
and
punch
him
in
the
stomach
in
spite
of
all
i
could
do
to
prevent
him
he
started
straight
for
the
officer
who
was
standing
all
unconscious
on
the
corner
watching
a
pretty
girl
who
was
looking
into
one
of
the
brilliantly
lighted
store
windows
now
was
my
time
to
rid
myself
of
this
most
undesirable
companion
and
i
wished
myself
in
my
own
room
instantly
i
found
myself
floating
about
over
my
bed
and
there
was
my
body
sleeping
as
peacefully
as
ever
i
was
somewhat
tired
but
i
remembered
our
contract
to
write
down
the
result
of
our
experiences
and
immediately
sat
down
to
do
it
after
i
had
written
it
i
read
it
over
carefully
to
see
if
i
had
overlooked
anything
and
then
wished
myself
in
bed
and
asleep
the
next
thing
i
knew
it
was
broad
daylight
there
on
my
were
the
pages
of
manuscript
which
i
had
written
they
were
real
enough
whether
the
rest
was
a
dream
or
not
the
mound
of
eternal
silence
i
ought
to
know
something
about
it
said
the
drummer
for
i
went
with
the
prospector
and
the
eastern
man
to
see
judson
i
remember
when
we
started
out
together
the
eastern
man
asked
the
prospector
if
he
thought
judson
was
really
crazy
said
the
prospector
is
as
crazy
as
a
loon
as
you
will
see
when
you
get
there
me
the
story
over
again
said
the
eastern
man
you
see
said
the
prospector
found
him
lying
in
the
hot
sand
away
off
on
the
desert
with
his
head
propped
up
against
a
rock
nearly
dead
for
want
of
water
when
they
tried
to
rouse
him
he
stared
at
them
vacantly
they
gave
him
a
little
water
and
as
soon
as
he
had
swallowed
it
he
fought
like
a
wild
animal
for
more
it
took
three
or
four
of
them
to
hold
him
he
cursed
and
swore
at
them
because
they
would
not
give
him
all
he
wanted
and
his
cries
were
pitiful
he
alternately
cursed
and
screamed
for
water
sometimes
as
loud
as
he
could
shout
and
then
again
in
faint
whispers
on
when
they
dared
to
give
him
more
at
a
time
he
became
tranquil
and
towards
night
after
he
had
drunk
a
bowl
full
of
thin
oatmeal
gruel
he
went
to
sleep
when
he
awoke
they
questioned
him
said
that
he
had
been
prospecting
with
his
partner
and
had
found
a
gulch
with
precipitous
cliffs
all
around
it
where
there
was
very
rich
placer
digging
directly
in
front
was
a
high
mound
covered
with
big
cacti
and
they
made
their
camp
on
the
top
of
this
there
was
a
little
water
in
the
cañon
held
in
rock
basins
and
with
this
they
washed
out
the
gold
and
got
a
lot
of
it
judson
says
three
or
four
thousand
dollars
worth
then
bad
luck
came
and
the
burro
died
three
days
afterwards
judson
partner
was
poisoned
in
some
way
and
died
a
few
hours
later
cursing
judson
and
saying
he
had
poisoned
him
buried
him
and
also
the
gold
it
was
too
heavy
for
him
to
pack
especially
as
he
had
no
way
to
carry
water
then
taking
a
small
bag
of
gold
dust
in
his
pocket
he
started
across
the
desert
he
had
a
hobby
for
taking
photographs
and
carried
a
small
camera
with
him
and
before
leaving
he
photographed
the
place
which
he
called
the
mound
of
eternal
silence
so
that
in
case
anything
happened
to
him
it
could
be
found
without
trouble
they
developed
the
negatives
later
and
he
has
them
pasted
all
around
his
room
he
called
the
place
the
mound
of
eternal
silence
because
during
the
two
months
he
was
there
he
never
saw
or
heard
a
single
living
thing
except
and
a
bird
or
two

judson
map
was
that
about
his
killing
the
dog
asked
the
eastern
man
you
see
when
judson
started
off
alone
the
dog
would
not
leave
his
dead
master
and
sat
upon
the
hill
howling
judson
was
afraid
he
would
attract
somebody
attention
if
they
happened
along
that
way
and
after
trying
to
get
him
to
follow
him
without
success
he
went
back
and
shot
him
the
first
thing
that
judson
saw
when
he
awoke
the
next
morning
after
they
had
found
him
was
the
dog
sitting
on
his
haunches
looking
at
him
judson
looked
at
the
animal
but
said
nothing
something
within
him
forced
him
to
keep
silence
after
a
time
he
snapped
his
fingers
and
called
the
dog
by
name
did
you
speak
asked
one
of
the
men
stevens
it
was
i
believe
i
was
only
calling
the
dog
said
judson
what
dog
asked
stevens
why
that
dog
of
course
said
judson
pointing
at
the
animal
you
are
crazy
man
answered
stevens
the
heat
yesterday
was
too
much
for
you
there
is
no
dog
there
turned
away
he
began
to
fear
there
might
be
something
the
matter
with
his
brain
and
that
there
was
no
dog
there
after
all
but
when
he
looked
again
there
he
was
as
plain
as
ever
i
will
take
the
brute
outside
of
camp
and
kill
him
when
i
get
a
chance
he
thought
evening
when
they
made
camp
at
a
small
water
hole
judson
walked
away
out
of
sight
and
hearing
of
the
camp
when
he
could
no
longer
be
seen
he
turned
and
aiming
his
pistol
at
the
dog
pulled
the
trigger
the
bullet
hit
the
ground
between
the
animal
legs
and
he
ran
back
a
few
paces
and
stood
grinning
at
judson
showing
his
teeth
and
his
face
looked
like
that
of
his
old
partner
judson
picked
up
a
large
rock
and
ran
at
the
dog
the
animal
yelped
slightly
and
started
for
camp
judson
increased
his
pace
and
the
dog
circled
out
into
the
desert
curse
you
cried
judson
i
kill
you
yet
several
times
he
threw
stones
at
the
animal
and
twice
he
fell
bruising
himself
among
the
loose
rocks
at
last
he
sat
down
what
is
the
matter
with
you
shouted
stevens
what
are
you
running
about
and
shouting
in
that
way
for
that
confounded
dog
of
mine
answered
judson
unthinkingly
nonsense
man
there
is
any
dog
walked
slowly
back
to
camp
followed
closely
by
the
dog
the
men
looked
at
him
strangely
that
night
when
he
went
to
sleep
the
brute
came
and
lay
down
beside
him
a
horrid
fear
took
possession
of
him
and
he
pushed
the
thing
away
but
it
immediately
crawled
back
again
at
last
he
arose
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
walking
up
and
down
the
desert
the
dog
following
close
at
his
heels
they
arrived
in
phœnix
the
doctor
advised
judson
to
go
to
a
quiet
place
and
rest
and
gave
him
an
opiate
do
he
go
back
and
get
the
gold
asked
the
eastern
man
as
i
have
told
you
whenever
he
starts
to
go
back
the
dog
meets
him
on
the
desert
and
he
is
only
free
from
it
when
he
stays
in
phœnix
he
says
the
dog
is
his
old
partner
and
will
never
let
him
go
back
there
again
that
is
why
he
is
willing
to
sell
his
secret
how
do
you
know
if
we
pay
him
this
money
asked
the
eastern
man
we
can
find
the
gold
his
map
and
directions
together
with
the
photographs
ought
to
make
it
sure
anyway
i
am
putting
up
of
my
money
with
your
and
run
as
much
risk
as
you
do
besides
you
never
would
have
known
about
it
if
it
had
been
for
me
he
take
less
than
asked
the
eastern
man
a
cent
i
have
tried
him
too
often
if
i
had
of
my
own
i
never
would
ask
any
one
to
go
in
with
me
it
a
snap
we
found
judson
seated
in
a
big
armchair
smoking
a
meerschaum
pipe
his
eyes
had
a
peculiar
wild
expression
and
he
glared
at
us
as
we
entered
do
you
people
want
he
asked
have
come
to
buy
your
claim
said
the
prospector
judson
laughed
a
strange
hard
laugh
the
same
gold
gold
gold
have
you
the
money
with
you
to
pay
for
it
he
asked
the
prospector
produced
a
bag
of
gold
pieces
and
shook
it
it
is
he
said
gentleman
and
myself
have
made
up
the
amount
shouted
judson
me
the
money
and
take
the
cursed
claim
buried
gold
and
all
and
much
good
may
it
do
you
i
will
go
away
far
away
from
here
my
god
to
think
that
i
should
sell
a
rich
claim
like
that
for
nothing
but
i
would
go
back
to
it
for
all
the
gold
in
the
world
three
times
i
have
tried
and
each
time
that
dog
devil
met
me
at
the
edge
of
the
desert
grinning
at
me
with
the
face
of
my
dead
partner
here
are
the
photographs
and
the
map
take
them
and
go
my
head
aches
go
away
and
leave
me
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
groaning
and
muttering
to
himself
the
prospector
put
the
bag
of
gold
on
the
table
and
taking
the
photographs
and
map
left
the
room
we
followed
him
closing
the
door
softly
behind
us
did
you
find
the
gold
i
asked
i
did
look
for
it
answered
the
drummer
they
offered
to
let
me
in
and
give
me
a
third
interest
for
but
somehow
i
did
like
the
idea
and
the
whole
thing
seemed
uncanny
and
it
is
lucky
i
did
the
prospector
and
the
eastern
man
got
back
a
week
later
without
having
discovered
the
of
eternal
silence
both
mad
as
hatters
and
each
laying
the
blame
of
the
failure
on
the
other
i
have
always
wondered
since
if
judson
was
really
as
crazy
as
they
thought
he
was
why
i
asked
what
made
you
doubt
it
oh
answered
the
drummer
i
ca
exactly
say
i
disbelieve
his
story
but
well
you
see
about
a
month
afterwards
i
was
in
phœnix
again
and
one
night
i
saw
the
prospector
and
the
lunatic
taking
a
drink
at
a
bar
together
a
little
later
the
prospector
passed
me
without
seeing
me
he
was
walking
arm
in
arm
with
a
stranger
and
as
they
went
by
i
heard
him
say
i
had
the
money
i
never
would
think
of
asking
any
one
to
go
in
with
me
he
calls
it
the
mound
of
eternal
silence
they
passed
on
and
their
voices
were
lost
to
me
in
the
distance

tixinopa
story
of
a
bad
indian
malita
was
a
the
daughter
of
an
old
squaw
man
she
had
spent
several
years
at
the
indian
school
in
phœnix
and
had
proved
herself
an
apt
pupil
later
she
went
to
work
on
simmons
ranch
she
was
a
very
pretty
healthy
looking
girl
and
one
day
morgan
jones
the
hunter
and
trapper
asked
her
to
marry
him
she
went
with
him
to
his
cabin
near
the
reservation
and
settled
down
jones
was
a
sort
of
chap
who
when
he
had
a
little
money
came
to
the
straggling
town
near
the
reservation
drank
considerable
whiskey
and
amused
himself
by
running
his
pony
up
and
down
the
one
street
firing
off
his
gun
and
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
this
was
jones
idea
of
a
good
time
and
his
method
of
contributing
his
share
to
the
sanguinary
ornamentation
of
the
embryo
metropolis
malita
made
jones
a
good
wife
and
attended
to
his
creature
comforts
to
the
best
of
her
ability
and
when
jones
returned
to
the
cabin
in
an
inebriated
condition
she
soothed
him
and
put
him
to
bed
looking
upon
such
incidents
as
a
matter
of
course
for
a
year
or
more
they
lived
contentedly
and
a
little
boy
was
born
to
them
on
the
reservation
lived
an
indian
named
tixinopa
a
splendid
specimen
of
a
savage
athlete
and
the
most
noted
runner
and
hunter
in
his
tribe
like
many
of
his
race
while
hating
the
white
man
he
loved
the
white
man
and
it
made
him
surly
and
quarrelsome
he
was
a
natural
leader
and
often
at
night
he
spoke
with
fiery
eloquence
of
the
wrongs
of
his
race
sowing
the
seeds
of
unrest
and
rebellion
tixinopa
was
the
only
cloud
which
disturbed
the
domestic
horizon
of
the
jones
family
he
haunted
the
vicinity
of
the
cabin
and
was
continually
asking
malita
for
whiskey
and
tobacco
when
jones
was
away
until
at
last
jones
intimated
to
him
gently
that
his
presence
was
to
say
the
least
undesirable
being
a
child
of
the
woods
and
hills
he
did
not
have
at
his
command
a
large
vocabulary
of
diplomatic
phrases
to
enable
him
to
do
this
politely
in
fact
he
was
blunt
in
describing
the
interview
to
malita
afterwards
he
said
i
told
him
if
he
cum
around
here
any
more
i
smash
his
head
an
he
grunts
an
draws
himself
up
this
and
looks
ugly
and
says
a
big
injun
and
i
told
him
to
go
to
hell
for
some
time
tixinopa
kept
away
from
the
cabin
but
one
day
he
appeared
and
demanded
whiskey
he
was
half
drunk
and
his
bloodshot
eyes
blinked
at
malita
as
he
swayed
unsteadily
in
the
doorway
no
tixinopa
there
is
no
whiskey
tixinopa
eyes
grew
ugly
you
lie
you
squaw
but
be
it
so
i
will
take
the
boy
away
until
you
remember
where
it
is
so
saying
he
lifted
the
baby
by
the
arm
and
swung
him
on
to
his
shoulder
the
child
cried
out
with
pain
from
its
twisted
arm
heart
sunk
with
a
dreadful
fear
give
the
child
to
me
tixinopa
do
not
be
so
rough
see
you
have
hurt
him
illustration
malita
she
tried
to
take
the
boy
but
tixinopa
pushed
her
away
roughly
and
she
fell
to
the
ground
up
she
sprang
and
threw
herself
upon
him
trying
to
get
the
boy
and
in
the
struggle
she
scratched
his
face
slightly
so
that
the
blood
came
with
a
curse
he
struck
her
full
in
the
face
with
his
clinched
fist
and
she
fell
as
if
dead
and
lay
with
her
hands
twitching
feebly
take
your
brat
he
hissed
throwing
the
baby
roughly
on
the
ground
beside
her
he
turned
to
walk
away
but
something
in
the
motionless
form
of
the
child
caused
him
to
look
again
and
he
saw
that
his
little
head
lay
doubled
under
his
arm
in
a
way
that
could
only
mean
one
thing
a
broken
neck
malita
rose
unsteadily
to
her
feet
and
looked
about
in
a
dazed
way
until
her
gaze
rested
upon
the
little
body
of
her
dead
baby
the
next
instant
she
was
striking
and
cutting
at
tixinopa
screaming
like
a
mad
thing
the
attack
was
so
sudden
and
fierce
that
trained
athlete
and
fighter
as
he
was
tixinopa
received
a
deep
cut
on
the
shoulder
and
a
slight
one
on
the
arm
before
he
succeeded
in
grasping
her
wrist
and
twisting
the
knife
from
her
then
seizing
her
by
the
hair
he
drew
her
to
him
and
drove
the
knife
twice
into
her
breast
throwing
her
to
the
ground
where
she
lay
gasping
her
life
away
in
broken
sobs
tixinopa
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
malita
and
was
quite
still
his
arm
pained
him
and
he
held
up
his
hand
and
watched
the
blood
dripping
from
his
fingers
then
he
took
a
revolver
from
his
belt
and
fired
shot
after
shot
into
the
bodies
of
the
dead
baby
and
the
dying
mother
twice
the
hammer
clicked
on
an
empty
shell
before
he
ceased
to
pull
the
trigger
and
he
slowly
turned
away
pushing
his
empty
pistol
into
his
belt
as
he
did
so
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
jones
but
a
different
jones
than
the
one
he
had
known
this
jones
face
was
white
and
drawn
and
looked
years
older
than
the
other
jones
the
hand
which
held
a
pistol
pointed
at
him
shook
unsteadily
a
minute
perhaps
two
minutes
passed
and
still
the
two
men
faced
each
other
then
an
evil
light
came
into
tixinopa
eyes
and
his
hand
slid
slowly
towards
the
handle
of
his
knife
to
be
instantly
smashed
by
a
bullet
from
pistol
another
shot
and
the
other
arm
was
broken
at
the
elbow
neither
man
had
spoken
but
now
tixinopa
began
a
low
wild
chant
raised
to
his
full
height
with
his
broken
arms
hanging
by
his
sides
he
chanted
the
death
song
of
his
people
the
same
song
which
had
been
sung
by
his
father
and
his
father
father
and
for
generations
past
by
all
the
dying
warriors
of
his
tribe
tixinopa
the
voice
was
a
husky
whisper
for
her
sake
i
wo
torture
yer
as
i
would
like
ter
god
give
me
strength
to
keep
from
it
but
i
afeared
he
wo
unless
i
kill
yer
quick
all
i
hope
is
that
if
there
is
a
hell
your
black
soul
will
roast
in
it
for
ever
and
ever
amen
the
muzzle
of
the
pistol
was
now
within
a
few
inches
of
the
naked
breast
still
the
low
wild
chant
went
on
the
bronze
figure
standing
as
if
turned
to
stone
then
another
shot
and
the
chant
stopped
ten
minutes
later
a
horseman
rode
slowly
into
the
desert
to
his
left
as
he
crossed
the
bed
of
the
alkali
stream
two
indian
boys
were
skinning
a
rabbit
alive
and
laughing
at
its
agony
from
afar
back
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
he
heard
the
strains
of
the
star
spangled
banner
played
by
the
pride
of
the
reservation
the
indian
band
a
queer
coincidence
you
say
said
doctor
watson
as
he
rested
one
arm
on
the
mantel
and
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
open
fire
you
say
there
is
no
proof
of
the
actuality
of
what
is
called
telepathy
or
and
perhaps
you
are
right
but
i
have
several
times
in
my
life
had
experiences
which
were
very
difficult
to
explain
except
by
some
such
theory
and
if
you
care
to
listen
i
will
tell
you
one
of
them
which
i
have
in
mind
our
chorus
of
approval
evidently
left
no
doubt
as
to
our
desire
to
hear
the
story
for
watson
smiled
and
lighting
a
fresh
cigar
he
began
as
follows
on
the
seventeenth
of
january
last
year
there
was
a
slight
on
the
northern
road
not
far
from
chicago
and
the
forward
trucks
of
one
of
the
cars
on
train
on
which
i
was
a
passenger
left
the
rails
but
luckily
the
train
was
going
slowly
at
the
time
and
there
was
little
damage
done
except
a
general
shaking
up
of
the
passengers
in
the
car
as
the
forward
wheels
bumped
roughly
over
the
sleepers
for
a
few
yards
before
the
train
stopped
the
other
cars
did
not
leave
the
track
and
only
one
man
was
seriously
injured
this
man
had
been
standing
on
the
platform
at
the
time
and
was
thrown
between
the
cars
and
badly
crushed
i
was
close
to
the
end
window
and
saw
him
fall
and
when
the
conductor
called
for
a
doctor
i
responded
at
once
i
found
the
man
lying
on
a
blanket
surrounded
by
a
number
of
the
passengers
he
seemed
to
suffer
but
little
pain
and
i
feared
from
a
casual
examination
he
was
badly
injured
internally
although
he
was
perfectly
conscious
he
was
bleeding
at
the
mouth
and
his
legs
seemed
to
be
paralyzed
he
asked
faintly
if
i
thought
he
was
going
to
die
and
i
cheered
him
up
as
is
customary
in
such
cases
but
shortly
afterwards
he
developed
such
serious
symptoms
that
i
felt
forced
to
tell
him
i
feared
he
was
seriously
hurt
and
it
was
quite
possible
he
would
live
but
a
few
hours
upon
hearing
this
he
became
very
much
agitated
and
whispered
to
me
that
he
wished
to
speak
to
me
alone
saying
he
had
something
of
the
utmost
importance
to
communicate
i
thought
it
was
probably
some
message
to
send
to
some
members
of
his
family
or
some
instructions
regarding
his
affairs
but
after
a
few
words
i
became
very
much
interested
he
talked
for
fifteen
minutes
part
of
the
time
being
sustained
by
the
use
of
stimulants
his
story
which
was
a
very
strange
one
i
will
repeat
as
nearly
as
possible
in
his
own
words
after
repeatedly
asking
me
to
assure
him
there
was
no
possible
chance
of
his
recovery
he
said
is
not
necessary
for
you
to
know
my
name
but
it
is
sufficient
for
me
to
tell
you
that
i
received
a
good
education
in
my
youth
and
graduated
with
high
honors
at
one
of
the
large
universities
in
this
country
i
always
had
more
or
less
interest
in
the
study
of
physiology
and
during
my
college
course
conducted
a
series
of
experiments
in
hypnotism
and
made
some
interesting
discoveries
regarding
the
exaltation
of
the
senses
and
especially
in
relation
to
illusion
and
hallucination
by
the
aid
of
suggestion
had
been
my
earnest
desire
to
occupy
the
position
of
professor
of
physiology
in
one
of
the
universities
but
failing
to
obtain
a
position
of
this
kind
and
having
no
means
of
support
i
gradually
became
poorer
and
poorer
earning
a
livelihood
as
best
i
could
until
i
became
discouraged
and
attempted
to
make
money
in
a
way
not
quite
so
honest
idea
suggested
itself
to
me
during
a
series
of
experiments
which
i
had
conducted
with
a
friend
of
mine
it
so
happened
that
this
friend
was
paying
teller
in
one
of
our
banks
of
chicago
where
he
is
he
is
a
thoroughly
honorable
man
in
every
way
but
i
found
that
he
was
a
good
hypnotic
subject
or
sensitive
as
we
call
it
at
first
he
could
not
be
considered
first
class
but
he
was
much
interested
in
the
subject
and
allowed
me
to
hypnotize
him
repeatedly
after
a
few
evenings
he
became
very
easily
influenced
and
one
of
the
best
subjects
i
had
ever
had
i
could
put
him
to
sleep
in
a
moment
simply
snapping
my
fingers
and
telling
him
i
wished
him
to
sleep
of
course
this
can
only
be
done
with
sensitives
who
have
been
repeatedly
hypnotized
these
conditions
i
succeeded
in
making
him
do
very
many
wonderful
things
especially
in
the
way
of
suggestions
a
suggestion
is
a
command
given
to
hypnotized
subjects
that
at
some
future
time
they
perform
a
certain
act
in
most
cases
in
waking
from
the
hypnotic
sleep
they
have
forgotten
that
the
suggestion
has
been
given
them
but
at
the
time
set
they
perform
the
act
unconsciously
as
though
by
their
own
volition
not
only
will
they
do
this
but
after
the
act
is
performed
they
usually
sink
into
a
quiet
sleep
from
which
they
awake
after
passing
into
the
normal
sleep
and
as
a
rule
have
forgotten
that
they
did
anything
unusual
or
that
they
have
been
hypnotized
and
take
up
the
thread
of
thought
again
at
the
point
where
they
first
entered
the
hypnotic
condition
they
do
not
remember
what
they
have
done
or
seen
their
mind
is
a
blank
as
to
all
that
occurred
during
the
time
they
were
hypnotized
footnote
this
is
unusual
the
subject
rarely
falls
asleep
after
carrying
out
a
suggestion
unless
commanded
to
do
ed
the
last
two
years
i
have
been
rather
fortunate
in
a
small
way
speculating
in
stocks
my
capital
being
small
the
amount
of
money
i
could
make
was
of
course
comparatively
little
yet
i
succeeded
in
doing
very
well
until
about
three
weeks
ago
when
by
two
or
three
unfortunate
speculations
i
found
myself
absolutely
destitute
and
without
a
penny
in
the
world
it
was
then
the
idea
suggested
itself
to
me
to
hypnotize
herrick
and
make
him
bring
me
money
from
the
bank
this
of
course
was
perfectly
possible
if
no
accident
occurred
or
no
unforeseen
difficulty
presented
itself
which
i
had
not
previously
thought
of
as
the
cashier
would
act
simply
as
an
instrument
being
governed
entirely
by
my
directions
i
asked
him
in
a
casual
way
several
times
about
the
affairs
of
the
bank
and
learned
one
day
that
the
bank
would
have
an
unusually
large
balance
in
settling
with
the
it
was
the
custom
for
herrick
to
lock
up
his
own
funds
and
simply
state
to
the
cashier
that
he
had
done
so
to
a
carefully
arranged
plan
i
hypnotized
him
last
evening
and
commanded
him
to
take
all
the
money
and
securities
he
had
in
his
possession
after
settling
with
the
and
instead
of
locking
them
in
his
vault
to
put
them
in
a
bag
of
course
taking
precautions
to
do
this
when
no
one
was
observing
him
and
then
leave
the
bank
in
the
usual
manner
was
to
take
a
carriage
and
drive
directly
to
a
small
unoccupied
house
which
is
situated
on
the
corner
of
blank
and
streets
was
my
intention
as
i
had
gone
so
far
to
go
still
further
i
knew
that
herrick
would
bring
me
the
money
and
securities
and
that
i
should
find
him
asleep
in
the
house
but
what
i
did
not
know
positively
and
what
i
feared
was
he
might
not
forget
what
he
had
done
when
he
as
a
rule
sensitives
obey
the
command
to
forget
but
in
the
course
of
my
various
experiments
i
have
found
sensitives
who
had
a
vague
idea
of
what
occurred
perhaps
nothing
tangible
but
still
sufficient
in
a
case
like
this
when
there
would
be
a
great
row
about
the
lost
securities
to
suggest
a
possible
clue
was
a
very
cold
day
six
degrees
below
i
think
and
i
had
deliberately
intended
to
leave
herrick
asleep
after
i
had
taken
the
money
from
him
and
let
him
take
his
chances
sleeping
without
any
fire
or
covering
in
an
hypnotic
condition
with
the
temperature
below
zero
and
you
can
judge
what
his
chances
would
have
been
this
scheme
i
thought
out
deliberately
and
what
seems
strange
i
had
not
the
least
repugnance
against
arranging
for
the
death
of
my
friend
after
i
had
once
made
up
my
mind
to
make
him
steal
the
securities
his
disappearance
seemed
to
be
the
only
way
to
insure
my
safety
of
course
no
one
could
know
i
was
connected
with
this
matter
i
would
not
go
near
the
bank
and
unless
he
was
followed
which
was
most
unlikely
as
he
had
been
with
the
bank
some
years
and
was
a
thoroughly
trusted
official
there
would
be
absolutely
no
chance
of
my
detection
watson
relighted
his
cigar
which
had
gone
out
and
continued
while
he
had
been
speaking
another
train
had
arrived
with
a
lot
of
workmen
who
were
busily
engaged
jacking
the
car
back
on
the
rails
the
train
was
about
to
return
to
chicago
so
i
inquired
the
name
of
the
bank
and
its
president
and
the
address
of
the
house
writing
them
down
so
there
could
be
no
possible
mistake
i
then
hastened
on
board
the
train
leaving
my
patient
under
the
care
of
morse
a
local
physician
who
agreed
to
notify
me
as
to
the
condition
of
the
man
later
in
the
day
upon
arriving
in
chicago
i
immediately
drove
to
the
bank
but
found
it
closed
i
was
told
however
that
bartlet
the
president
was
attending
a
corporation
meeting
in
an
office
in
the
same
building
i
immediately
hunted
him
up
and
upon
hearing
my
story
he
hastily
ordered
a
carriage
and
we
drove
to
the
house
as
described
on
our
way
out
we
stopped
and
picked
up
marsh
who
as
you
know
is
very
much
interested
in
such
matters
it
was
quite
a
long
drive
but
we
found
the
place
without
difficulty
it
was
unoccupied
and
many
of
the
windows
were
broken
and
altogether
it
presented
a
very
dilapidated
appearance
such
as
the
cheap
houses
on
the
outskirts
of
a
great
city
often
do
after
having
been
unoccupied
for
a
year
or
two
we
tried
the
door
and
found
it
unlocked
on
the
first
floor
the
rooms
were
entirely
empty
loose
papers
scattered
about
and
no
signs
of
any
one
having
entered
the
house
upon
going
upstairs
we
found
the
door
on
the
first
landing
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
closed
but
not
locked
at
the
back
of
the
room
was
a
cracked
wooden
stool
and
a
dilapidated
hair
sofa
which
had
evidently
been
considered
too
used
up
to
be
of
any
value
part
of
the
cover
was
torn
away
one
of
the
legs
was
broken
and
some
of
the
hair
stuffing
was
lying
scattered
about
the
floor
on
this
lounge
lay
herrick
apparently
sound
asleep
his
lips
blue
with
cold
his
face
pale
and
the
general
appearance
of
a
man
half
frozen
to
death
he
was
breathing
very
quietly
however
and
his
heart
action
was
still
fairly
good
although
somewhat
slow
by
his
side
lay
a
small
bag
which
it
is
needless
to
say
was
pounced
upon
by
bartlet
it
contained
some
valuable
securities
and
a
great
bundle
of
bank
bills
of
large
denomination
both
marsh
and
i
considered
herrick
condition
as
decidedly
interesting
and
unusual
and
we
were
both
of
the
opinion
that
as
part
of
the
story
had
proved
true
it
was
very
likely
the
whole
would
turn
out
just
as
described
if
this
proved
to
be
the
case
all
that
now
remained
to
be
done
was
to
restore
herrick
to
his
normal
condition
which
might
or
might
not
be
easy
to
accomplish
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
get
him
out
of
such
a
low
temperature
we
tried
various
methods
of
restoring
consciousness
but
without
success
what
we
did
not
like
was
that
his
heart
action
was
gradually
becoming
weaker
we
gave
a
hypodermic
injection
of
strychnia
and
the
heart
was
soon
acting
in
a
much
more
satisfactory
manner
there
was
no
return
to
consciousness
however
so
taking
him
in
the
carriage
we
drove
back
to
marsh
house
and
arriving
there
we
all
turned
to
and
did
what
we
could
to
restore
herrick
to
consciousness
now
that
he
was
in
a
warm
room
the
drawn
expression
and
the
blue
look
left
his
face
but
otherwise
he
appeared
to
sleep
as
soundly
as
ever
the
heart
was
now
acting
very
well
and
aside
from
the
coma
the
condition
of
the
patient
gave
us
no
cause
for
anxiety
as
time
went
on
however
and
we
absolutely
failed
to
waken
him
and
the
heart
again
showed
signs
of
weakness
we
began
to
feel
somewhat
uneasy
you
see
said
watson
we
did
not
know
what
suggestion
was
given
the
patient
these
suggestions
are
peculiar
in
their
action
upon
some
sensitives
if
as
it
is
fair
to
suppose
this
man
was
ordered
to
sleep
he
should
in
the
natural
course
of
events
sleep
for
a
number
of
hours
and
then
awake
after
passing
from
the
hypnotic
sleep
to
the
normal
sleep
but
we
know
very
little
of
the
effect
on
some
nervous
systems
of
suggestions
another
thing
in
many
cases
the
patient
will
not
waken
or
can
not
be
wakened
except
by
the
person
who
put
him
to
sleep
the
reason
for
this
is
plain
enough
part
of
the
effect
on
the
mind
of
hypnotic
suggestion
is
due
entirely
to
sleep
the
skilled
hypnotist
commands
one
of
his
sensitives
to
sleep
under
certain
conditions
the
sensitive
expects
to
be
awakened
by
the
same
voice
and
in
the
same
way
and
habit
and
association
have
fixed
in
his
mind
certain
conditions
which
he
associates
with
the
order
to
awake
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
herrick
heard
what
we
were
saying
when
we
spoke
to
him
in
a
loud
voice
but
he
heard
it
without
understanding
much
as
a
person
in
a
sleepy
condition
hears
noises
about
him
without
trying
to
comprehend
them
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
the
man
who
put
herrick
to
sleep
could
have
wakened
him
in
a
moment
while
we
with
all
our
knowledge
and
experience
were
unable
to
make
his
brain
regain
its
normal
condition
we
decided
to
let
him
sleep
and
if
at
the
end
of
a
few
hours
he
did
not
regain
consciousness
we
would
try
again
what
we
could
do
to
assist
him
of
course
watching
the
heart
in
the
meanwhile
and
using
or
strychnia
if
indicated
at
that
moment
herrick
suddenly
spoke
at
first
huskily
and
then
in
a
loud
clear
voice
shouting
yes
i
hear
you
i
am
awake
then
he
sat
up
asking
in
a
dazed
way
am
i
what
does
this
mean
as
he
did
so
the
clock
in
the
hall
struck
the
hour
of
seven
the
queerest
part
of
this
story
is
suggested
by
a
letter
received
from
morse
the
next
day
which
read
as
follows
dear
watson
you
asked
me
to
write
you
about
the
injured
man
and
i
do
so
now
to
tell
you
he
is
dead
he
died
a
minute
or
two
before
seven
last
evening
i
know
the
hour
exactly
because
i
was
watching
him
at
the
time
and
for
some
moments
he
had
been
whispering
and
muttering
to
himself
but
all
i
could
catch
was
something
about
i
withdraw
my
command
when
suddenly
raising
himself
he
shouted
wake
up
wake
up
and
fell
back
dead
just
as
the
clock
in
the
struck
seven
i
should
be
much
interested
to
hear
whether
his
story
was
true
or
not
drop
me
a
line
about
it
when
you
have
time
very
sincerely
yours
morse
story
of
an
insane
sailor
that
of
yours
said
the
doctor
reminds
me
that
i
have
an
interesting
one
of
my
own
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
what
it
is
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
silver
coin
and
handed
it
to
jennings
as
he
spoke
one
edge
had
been
flattened
and
a
hole
pierced
in
it
ah
an
old
spanish
piece
said
jennings
evidently
of
the
time
of
pope
leo
fourth
sometime
in
the
sixteenth
century
a
very
interesting
piece
where
did
you
get
it
there
is
a
curious
story
connected
with
that
coin
meditatively
remarked
watson
perhaps
you
would
like
to
hear
it
illustration
one
edge
had
been
flattened
and
a
hole
pierced
in
it
we
had
been
dining
with
watson
and
were
now
comfortably
seated
in
the
library
before
an
open
fire
it
was
snowing
outside
making
the
warm
bright
study
all
the
more
cheerful
by
contrast
perhaps
you
remember
said
watson
that
during
the
winter
of
i
devoted
much
more
of
my
time
than
usual
to
the
insane
asylum
i
was
very
much
interested
in
testing
the
value
of
hypnotism
for
insane
patients
especially
mild
cases
and
those
having
illusions
and
insistent
ideas
i
had
been
quite
successful
in
one
case
a
woman
who
had
tried
to
starve
herself
to
death
under
the
impression
that
the
devil
commanded
her
not
to
eat
was
greatly
benefited
by
suggestion
suggesting
that
the
devil
would
not
come
any
more
induced
pronounced
hysteria
but
when
hypnotized
and
told
that
the
devil
commanded
her
to
eat
instead
of
to
abstain
from
food
she
took
nourishment
readily
and
soon
developed
an
extraordinary
appetite
an
immediate
improvement
in
her
condition
was
noticeable
and
as
her
general
bodily
health
improved
the
illusions
became
less
and
less
frequent
and
she
was
discharged
from
the
asylum
as
cured
in
less
than
three
months
watson
paused
and
gazed
meditatively
at
the
end
of
his
cigar
ever
tried
to
hypnotize
an
insane
person
jennings
not
that
i
remember
you
morris
ca
say
that
i
have
hm
well
sometimes
you
succeed
and
sometimes
you
do
more
often
you
do
there
was
one
patient
a
man
by
the
name
of
allen
who
had
been
a
sailor
he
was
subject
to
fits
of
extreme
melancholia
and
at
times
was
positively
dangerous
as
he
imagined
some
one
was
trying
to
poison
him
i
never
succeeded
in
hypnotizing
him
although
i
tried
repeatedly
however
i
saw
him
every
day
and
as
his
general
health
improved
his
attacks
of
melancholia
became
less
frequent
he
seemed
grateful
to
me
for
taking
an
interest
in
him
and
often
talked
with
me
about
his
early
life
and
the
countries
he
had
visited
shortly
after
i
was
called
away
and
did
not
return
to
the
asylum
for
two
weeks
and
when
i
did
go
back
i
found
that
allen
was
dead
he
had
cut
his
throat
one
afternoon
with
a
large
and
made
a
mighty
clean
job
of
it
too
well
continued
the
doctor
among
his
effects
they
found
a
package
addressed
to
me
which
contained
a
letter
and
a
silver
coin
the
coin
you
now
hold
in
your
hand
the
letter
i
have
here
in
my
desk
he
opened
a
drawer
and
took
out
a
large
yellow
envelope
containing
a
number
of
pages
of
closely
written
manuscript
this
letter
said
watson
as
he
slowly
turned
over
the
pages
contains
a
story
so
strange
that
i
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
it
had
any
foundation
in
fact
but
during
the
past
year
or
two
i
have
learned
certain
things
which
have
caused
me
to
change
my
opinion
whether
the
story
is
true
or
not
we
will
of
course
never
know
but
i
believe
that
it
is
a
true
record
of
events
which
actually
happened
i
have
made
some
inquiries
and
find
that
the
places
mentioned
do
exist
or
did
at
the
time
this
story
was
written
and
but
never
mind
i
will
read
you
the
letter
and
you
can
form
your
own
conclusions
watson
sir
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
kill
myself
but
before
i
die
i
wish
to
make
a
confession
of
my
wrong
doings
as
insists
that
i
shall
and
i
dare
not
disobey
him
i
therefore
write
this
confession
to
be
read
by
you
after
i
am
dead
tell
me
i
i
hear
the
voice
and
see
the
man
i
tell
you
doctor
you
who
think
me
crazy
are
the
one
who
is
deceived
you
do
not
believe
in
telepathy
and
and
yet
i
could
tell
many
times
when
you
looked
at
me
of
what
you
were
thinking
i
tell
you
that
i
hear
jim
voice
as
plainly
as
i
ever
heard
yours
and
he
talks
to
me
and
tells
me
that
he
will
never
leave
me
while
i
live
and
then
he
laughs
oh
that
laugh
he
comes
often
at
night
and
wakes
me
out
of
a
sound
sleep
with
that
awful
laugh
and
then
he
whispers
to
me
to
go
to
sleep
again
of
course
you
do
not
believe
in
spirits
or
ghosts
and
you
believe
i
am
crazy
and
that
the
form
of
my
dead
partner
which
comes
to
me
and
talks
to
me
and
whose
voice
i
hear
as
plainly
as
i
ever
heard
yours
exists
wholly
in
my
imagination
well
doctor
you
have
been
kind
to
me
and
i
hope
and
pray
you
will
never
suffer
the
way
i
have
suffered
during
the
past
three
years
three
years
ago
i
was
on
board
the
ada
gray
a
small
schooner
off
the
coast
of
florida
bound
for
the
isthmus
there
were
seven
of
us
in
all
including
the
captain
and
mate
the
latter
an
old
pal
of
mine
who
had
arranged
to
get
me
in
as
one
of
the
crew
in
some
way
he
had
learned
that
the
captain
was
to
take
with
him
some
two
thousand
in
gold
and
although
we
had
no
plans
we
intended
to
get
the
gold
in
some
way
on
our
way
down
we
had
talked
over
many
schemes
but
none
of
them
seemed
satisfactory
the
gold
was
kept
in
a
small
fireproof
safe
in
the
captain
cabin
but
it
was
an
affair
and
we
did
not
anticipate
much
trouble
from
that
quarter
even
if
we
could
not
find
the
key
the
great
point
was
how
we
were
to
get
the
money
and
get
away
at
last
we
decided
to
drug
the
men
coffee
and
when
they
were
sleeping
from
its
effects
we
would
take
the
money
and
leave
in
the
schooner
yawl
in
which
as
the
weather
was
very
calm
and
the
florida
coast
could
be
seen
in
the
distance
we
should
have
no
difficulty
in
making
the
shore
had
overhauled
the
medicine
chest
and
had
found
a
vial
containing
a
lot
of
morphine
pills
marked
grain
and
as
neither
he
nor
i
knew
how
much
morphine
it
took
to
drug
a
man
he
watched
his
opportunity
and
emptied
the
contents
of
the
vial
into
the
coffee
supper
we
kept
on
deck
for
some
time
waiting
results
at
last
jim
went
forward
and
reported
everything
quiet
and
the
men
apparently
all
asleep
we
found
the
captain
in
his
cabin
lying
on
his
bunk
breathing
heavily
the
key
to
the
safe
was
in
the
captain
pocket
and
we
opened
it
without
difficulty
there
were
six
rolls
of
pieces
marked
two
hundred
dollars
each
eight
rolls
of
pieces
and
a
bag
of
silver
took
the
money
and
some
other
things
we
found
in
the
cabin
including
a
pair
of
revolvers
a
and
a
rifle
and
put
them
in
the
boat
together
with
a
small
keg
of
water
tinned
meat
and
a
bag
of
ship
biscuit
after
these
were
carefully
stowed
away
in
the
yawl
jim
went
back
to
the
cabin
while
i
busied
myself
arranging
things
in
the
boat
he
soon
came
on
deck
again
bringing
several
bottles
of
brandy
and
coming
to
the
side
of
the
schooner
reached
them
one
by
one
to
me
over
the
side
as
he
handed
me
the
last
bottle
i
saw
the
burly
form
of
our
negro
cook
rise
slowly
out
of
the
hatchway
rubbing
his
eyes
as
if
half
asleep
jim
saw
my
stare
of
surprise
and
turning
quickly
faced
the
negro
who
was
looking
at
us
with
a
dazed
expression
he
could
not
have
drunk
of
the
coffee
for
i
have
since
learned
the
amount
of
morphine
jim
put
in
the
pot
was
more
than
enough
to
kill
the
entire
crew
turned
and
walking
slowly
up
to
the
man
said
hoarsely
go
down
at
the
same
time
pointing
to
the
hatchway
what
for
asked
the
negro
moving
a
step
backward
none
of
your
business
what
for
go
down
i
tell
you
i
do
take
no
orders
from
you
nohow
answered
the
man
the
captain
a
word
jim
struck
him
full
in
the
face
with
all
his
strength
the
blow
was
an
awful
one
and
the
negro
staggered
back
and
would
have
fallen
had
not
he
brought
up
against
the
foremast
he
roared
with
rage
and
came
at
jim
with
a
rush
like
a
mad
bull
jim
bent
sideways
and
something
flashed
in
his
hand
as
he
struck
upwards
under
the
man
arm
the
negro
stumbled
forward
and
fell
on
the
deck
and
then
sat
up
and
began
to
cough
he
coughed
incessantly
like
a
man
who
has
swallowed
something
which
choked
him
jim
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
then
without
a
word
cast
off
the
painter
and
jumped
into
the
boat
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
so
we
each
took
an
oar
and
pulled
towards
the
faint
line
of
land
just
visible
in
the
western
horizon
schooner
lay
almost
motionless
with
the
silence
of
death
about
her
the
negro
had
stopped
coughing
and
all
was
still
save
the
faint
creaking
of
the
masts
and
spars
and
the
sounds
of
our
oars
in
the
rowlocks
the
west
the
clouds
lay
in
great
masses
of
gold
and
purple
tinting
the
sea
with
colors
damn
pretty
sunset
remarked
jim
as
he
drew
in
his
oar
and
bent
over
to
light
his
pipe
and
then
musingly
i
wish
i
had
had
to
kill
that
nigger
after
dark
a
gentle
breeze
sprung
up
from
the
southeast
and
we
put
up
a
little
sail
we
had
brought
with
us
rocks
light
was
in
plain
sight
and
about
midnight
we
rounded
cape
florida
and
entered
biscayne
bay
and
by
daylight
we
made
the
mouth
of
the
miami
river
where
we
tied
up
to
a
small
pier
owned
by
a
man
named
brickle
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
stood
a
long
low
stone
building
which
they
told
us
was
once
used
as
a
government
building
and
was
called
fort
dallas
told
the
people
we
had
come
from
key
west
following
the
coast
along
inside
the
keys
and
were
on
a
hunting
and
fishing
trip
upon
inquiry
we
learned
that
there
was
very
little
game
about
the
bay
except
crocodiles
but
that
we
could
get
splendid
sport
by
going
up
the
river
into
the
everglades
and
following
the
shore
line
north
to
new
river
they
advised
us
to
get
an
indian
to
go
with
us
this
plan
suited
us
exactly
as
once
having
disappeared
in
the
wilderness
we
could
come
out
at
some
other
point
and
having
assumed
new
names
could
go
forth
into
the
world
in
perfect
safety
starting
we
bought
a
light
boat
for
use
in
shallow
water
and
after
rowing
up
the
river
a
few
miles
we
made
camp
and
burned
the
yawl
first
breaking
her
up
with
our
axes
this
took
up
the
greater
part
of
the
day
in
the
afternoon
jim
went
up
to
the
head
of
the
river
and
reported
meeting
an
indian
who
told
him
of
a
large
island
which
was
as
near
as
he
could
judge
about
thirty
miles
to
the
north
on
which
there
were
deer
and
turkeys
had
plenty
of
provisions
and
for
three
days
we
pushed
our
boat
northward
among
the
islands
of
the
great
grassy
lake
in
many
places
the
water
was
so
shallow
we
had
to
push
our
way
through
grass
and
reeds
we
noticed
a
great
many
white
flowers
growing
on
the
banks
of
the
islands
and
were
abundant
but
they
had
no
smell
evening
on
the
third
day
we
landed
on
a
large
island
on
which
there
was
a
high
mound
hundreds
of
white
herons
and
various
other
kinds
of
birds
were
nesting
in
the
trees
and
there
were
a
good
many
ducks
about
we
shot
some
of
the
herons
and
cut
off
the
long
plumes
but
the
flesh
was
strong
and
unpalatable
the
ducks
however
were
very
good
camped
on
the
mound
which
was
much
higher
than
the
rest
of
the
island
and
decided
to
stay
there
for
a
day
or
two
while
putting
up
the
tent
i
saw
something
shine
and
picked
up
a
silver
coin
which
had
evidently
been
worn
as
a
medal
as
one
edge
had
been
flattened
and
a
hole
pierced
in
it
there
was
no
date
but
it
was
evidently
very
old
day
we
tried
fishing
and
shot
several
ducks
we
had
but
one
so
took
turns
with
it
at
the
ducks
evening
jim
produced
an
old
pack
of
cards
from
his
pocket
and
suggested
a
game
of
poker
my
luck
went
against
me
from
the
beginning
and
when
we
stopped
playing
i
had
lost
fully
of
my
share
the
next
morning
i
awoke
feeling
remorseful
and
sulky
and
demanded
that
jim
play
another
game
to
give
me
a
chance
to
get
even
he
assented
readily
enough
but
my
bad
luck
continued
and
in
an
hour
i
had
lost
all
of
my
money
and
had
nothing
left
to
bet
jim
got
up
taking
the
gun
and
went
down
to
the
boat
to
repair
a
leak
which
had
bothered
us
the
day
before
i
sat
on
a
log
inwardly
raging
and
cursing
myself
for
my
foolishness
the
rifle
was
leaning
against
the
log
near
me
and
involuntarily
i
took
it
and
dropped
the
lever
to
see
if
it
was
loaded
it
was
empty
and
the
hammer
moved
back
and
forth
at
the
touch
of
my
finger
evidently
the
spring
was
broken
but
how
why
i
felt
in
my
pocket
for
my
revolver
with
feverish
haste
gone
then
i
understood
rose
and
walked
slowly
down
the
slope
of
the
mound
and
nearly
stepped
on
a
large
rattlesnake
which
lay
coiled
up
beside
a
palmetto
root
i
looked
at
the
snake
as
he
lay
there
watching
me
rattling
angrily
all
the
while
and
then
i
looked
at
jim
coat
which
hung
on
a
branch
near
by
and
at
the
doctored
rifle
in
my
hand
and
the
more
i
looked
the
more
wicked
thoughts
came
into
my
mind
i
glanced
towards
jim
he
was
apparently
busy
with
the
boat
and
i
could
just
see
the
top
of
his
back
as
he
bent
over
i
hastily
fastened
one
of
the
dead
herons
to
a
stick
and
held
it
in
front
of
the
snake
which
immediately
struck
it
in
the
breast
and
then
uncoiled
and
slowly
retreated
into
the
scrub
taking
two
pins
from
my
coat
i
inserted
them
into
the
holes
made
by
the
fangs
of
the
rattlesnake
and
took
them
out
covered
with
blood
and
poison
in
a
few
minutes
this
dried
and
i
then
fastened
the
pins
inside
the
arm
of
jim
coat
in
such
a
way
that
his
hand
would
be
scratched
when
he
put
it
on
done
i
hung
the
coat
back
on
the
branch
and
walked
off
a
little
way
but
feeling
more
than
half
inclined
to
go
back
and
take
the
pins
out
again
while
there
was
yet
time
perhaps
jim
did
not
mean
to
kill
me
but
simply
wished
to
protect
himself
against
treachery
on
my
part
but
then
i
remembered
the
negro
and
the
morphine
and
well
dead
men
tell
no
tales
as
i
turned
to
go
back
i
saw
jim
in
the
act
of
taking
down
his
coat
and
i
felt
a
queer
choky
sensation
in
my
throat
and
a
sort
of
half
catch
to
my
breath
as
he
pushed
his
arm
through
the
sleeve
at
the
same
time
putting
the
back
of
his
hand
to
his
lips
in
a
way
that
could
only
have
one
meaning
i
watched
him
with
an
ugly
feeling
of
satisfaction
wondering
how
long
it
would
take
for
the
poison
to
begin
to
take
effect
put
a
couple
of
sticks
on
the
fire
and
then
sat
down
on
a
log
and
commenced
to
fill
his
pipe
but
soon
laid
it
down
curse
it
he
said
i
feel
queer
got
up
and
walked
up
and
down
rubbing
his
arm
he
looked
at
me
in
an
odd
sort
of
way
once
or
twice
and
then
went
into
the
tent
and
lay
down
shortly
after
he
called
to
me
and
on
my
going
to
the
door
of
the
tent
he
tried
to
rise
but
fell
back
and
became
delirious
laughing
and
shouting
my
name
and
muttering
to
himself
he
breathed
with
difficulty
and
in
a
little
while
became
unconscious
and
just
as
the
sun
was
sinking
over
the
faint
line
of
trees
in
the
west
he
died
took
down
the
tent
and
dug
a
hole
and
buried
him
where
he
lay
i
built
a
huge
fire
and
sat
by
it
all
night
without
closing
my
eyes
towards
morning
the
moon
came
up
and
the
sounds
of
the
night
noises
ceased
and
as
soon
as
it
was
light
i
put
the
gold
and
what
things
i
needed
in
the
boat
and
made
haste
to
leave
the
island
i
paddled
for
two
or
three
hours
before
i
noticed
that
the
sun
which
had
been
to
my
right
when
i
started
was
at
my
left
and
i
knew
that
i
must
have
turned
the
boat
around
turned
about
and
paddled
on
steadily
all
day
long
but
night
found
me
with
no
signs
of
dry
land
anywhere
nothing
but
an
unending
stretch
of
grass
and
water
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
it
grew
dark
i
lay
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
tried
to
sleep
but
as
soon
as
i
closed
my
eyes
i
felt
cold
all
over
a
creepy
sort
of
cold
and
heard
voices
whispering
at
first
i
told
myself
they
were
not
voices
was
a
trick
of
my
imagination
the
wind
perhaps
or
the
rustle
of
the
grass
about
me
but
then
i
heard
jim
voice
there
could
be
no
mistaking
his
horrid
sneering
laugh
it
made
me
afraid
but
do
what
i
would
i
could
not
help
hearing
it
i
stopped
my
ears
and
wrapped
my
head
in
my
coat
but
still
from
time
to
time
i
could
hear
the
voices
whispering
and
jim
laugh
and
at
times
i
felt
cold
next
day
i
poled
and
paddled
until
late
in
the
afternoon
i
felt
very
hot
and
my
head
ached
as
though
it
would
split
i
had
a
pain
in
the
back
of
my
neck
and
drank
a
great
deal
of
water
i
knew
i
had
some
sort
of
a
fever
but
having
no
medicine
i
could
do
nothing
but
push
on
hoping
to
find
my
way
to
dry
land
that
day
i
continually
heard
jim
voice
laughing
at
me
and
the
next
i
knew
i
found
myself
in
an
indian
camp
and
was
told
that
i
had
been
found
in
the
boat
sick
the
gold
was
gone
the
indians
claimed
it
was
not
in
the
boat
one
of
them
seemed
to
be
a
chief
and
wore
a
big
turban
on
his
head
with
a
silver
band
around
it
they
told
me
his
name
was
tom
tiger
now
doctor
jim
is
whispering
to
me
again
and
telling
me
it
is
time
in
five
minutes
after
i
sign
this
i
shall
be
dead
i
shall
make
no
mistake
my
knife
is
very
sharp
allen
the
elixir
of
life
behold
said
doctor
watson
the
elixir
of
life
robinson
looked
up
from
his
writing
and
assumed
an
expression
of
deep
interest
wonderful
i
have
often
heard
of
it
is
it
the
true
of
the
ancients
or
a
new
and
more
subtle
compound
listen
scoffer
if
you
will
behave
with
a
decorum
consistent
with
the
gravity
of
the
subject
i
will
explain
how
i
became
the
possessor
of
this
wonderful
powder
perhaps
in
your
life
of
seclusion
and
deep
toil
you
may
not
have
noticed
this
advertisement
which
has
appeared
for
the
last
month
regularly
in
the
morning
paper
watson
took
from
his
a
newspaper
clipping
and
read
as
follows
methuselah
club
the
object
of
this
club
is
to
enable
its
members
to
live
to
be
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
old
all
persons
desiring
to
become
members
should
apply
for
particulars
to
rengee
sing
no
street
city
are
you
a
member
inquired
robinson
not
as
yet
but
jones
is
and
it
was
through
jones
that
i
came
into
possession
of
this
mysterious
drug
it
seems
that
jones
decided
after
reading
the
advertisement
that
he
would
like
to
become
a
member
of
the
club
jones
health
is
not
very
good
as
you
know
and
he
called
on
rengee
sing
and
the
result
of
the
interview
was
that
he
came
away
with
this
small
vial
of
the
wonderful
elixir
for
which
he
paid
twenty
good
dollars
he
was
so
impressed
by
the
gentleman
who
sold
him
the
powder
that
he
came
to
me
as
his
medical
adviser
to
ask
my
opinion
as
to
the
advisability
of
taking
some
of
it
he
brought
with
him
a
paper
purporting
to
be
the
translation
of
an
ancient
papyrus
manuscript
the
original
of
which
was
in
thibetian
or
sanscrit
and
which
was
ingenious
if
fraudulent
he
told
me
a
rambling
story
of
how
this
rengee
sing
had
procured
this
powder
and
the
whole
thing
was
so
peculiar
that
i
decided
to
interview
the
gentleman
myself
but
first
i
made
a
point
of
getting
our
friend
strauss
to
analyze
the
powder
his
report
of
the
analysis
shows
it
to
be
composed
entirely
of
chloride
of
sodium
or
common
salt
with
a
small
quantity
of
some
unknown
vegetable
matter
which
gives
it
a
yellow
color
armed
with
this
information
i
called
upon
rengee
sing
at
his
office
on
street
you
interest
me
said
robinson
glancing
at
his
work
and
palpably
attempting
to
suppress
a
yawn
watson
arose
and
gently
but
firmly
removed
the
pen
from
fingers
he
then
placed
a
book
on
the
papers
and
continued
the
office
was
distinctly
oriental
and
there
were
numerous
bokhara
and
other
good
rugs
scattered
about
besides
there
were
gorgeous
divans
and
the
air
was
heavy
with
peculiar
eastern
odors
i
was
admitted
by
a
gigantic
negro
dressed
in
oriental
costume
and
another
negro
arose
as
i
entered
and
stood
respectfully
at
the
inner
door
i
asked
for
rengee
sing
and
was
informed
that
he
would
at
liberty
in
a
few
moments
and
i
sit
down
and
wait
all
in
very
good
english
from
one
of
the
gigantic
sable
guardians
who
bowed
me
in
i
was
kept
waiting
but
a
few
moments
when
the
door
opened
and
a
small
hindoo
came
softly
into
the
room
dressed
in
the
ordinary
european
costume
there
was
nothing
striking
about
him
except
his
eyes
which
were
really
the
most
wonderful
eyes
i
have
ever
seen
in
a
human
being
with
the
gentle
manner
peculiar
to
his
race
he
smiled
and
asked
me
to
take
a
seat
near
the
window
is
it
possible
said
robinson
languidly
lighting
a
cigarette
is
what
possible
inquired
watson
frowning
slightly
why
that
he
asked
you
to
take
a
seat
near
the
window
robinson
remarked
watson
sternly
remember
that
your
mental
infirmities
will
not
prevent
my
punching
your
head
if
you
interrupt
me
with
any
more
foolish
questions
robinson
grinned
and
after
ostentatiously
placing
a
within
easy
reach
watson
continued
i
inquired
if
he
was
the
person
to
whom
i
should
apply
for
information
about
the
methuselah
club
he
answered
that
he
had
the
honor
of
being
the
president
of
the
club
and
would
be
glad
to
supply
me
with
all
information
in
his
power
did
i
wish
to
join
friend
of
mine
i
said
already
become
a
member
and
the
description
of
a
wonderful
powder
has
interested
me
likewise
the
history
of
the
powder
the
hindoo
smiled
gently
showing
his
white
teeth
and
said
that
he
was
not
surprised
at
my
curiosity
he
then
went
to
a
desk
and
took
from
it
the
printed
circular
which
jones
had
already
shown
me
and
which
was
supposed
to
be
a
translation
of
the
ancient
manuscript
it
is
the
one
i
hold
in
my
hand
please
glance
over
it
before
i
continue
my
story
robinson
took
the
paper
what
is
this
hieroglyphic
affair
at
the
top
here
he
asked
that
said
watson
is
probably
a
copy
of
some
very
ancient
amulet
or
talisman
the
fish
at
the
bottom
was
often
used
to
designate
or
the
master
next
above
we
have
the
solomon
seal
then
the
four
chaldaic
letters
which
is
deity
the
other
symbols
are
strange
to
me
ah
said
robinson
a
weird
sort
of
thing
is
it
not
do
be
sarcastic
read
it
sententiously
remarked
watson
robinson
did
so
illustration
him
who
dares
to
live
forever
take
of
the
powder
but
let
him
think
of
but
speak
it
not
on
pain
of
death
let
absolute
be
known
to
him
let
him
study
the
secret
and
ponder
on
the
mysteries
of
let
him
also
say
each
day
in
his
prayer
who
takes
of
the
powder
three
times
should
acquaint
himself
with
חד
the
and
the
then
he
will
never
die
even
though
he
wished
to
live
a
thousand
years
so
it
shall
be
footnote
translation
of
the
sacred
manuscript
found
with
the
elixir
of
life
well
remarked
watson
what
do
you
think
of
it
fake
answered
robinson
verily
out
of
the
mouths
of
babes
said
watson
but
o
learned
friend
you
have
not
heard
the
whole
story
listen
i
asked
rengee
sing
if
he
would
be
good
enough
to
explain
to
me
fully
about
the
powder
and
especially
how
and
where
he
obtained
it
dear
sir
he
said
see
you
are
a
scientific
man
and
it
always
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
meet
such
and
to
explain
to
them
as
fully
as
possible
how
i
rengee
sing
obtained
possession
of
one
of
the
most
valuable
treasures
in
the
world
the
elixir
of
life
but
before
doing
so
i
must
enroll
your
name
among
the
members
of
our
society
in
fact
one
of
the
rules
of
the
society
is
that
unless
a
person
becomes
a
member
we
can
tell
him
nothing
beyond
allowing
him
to
read
the
circular
which
you
have
already
seen
the
initiation
fee
is
five
dollars
and
you
are
at
liberty
not
to
take
the
powder
if
you
desire
not
to
do
so
after
you
have
become
a
member
but
if
you
wish
to
become
a
member
in
high
standing
and
to
take
the
powder
which
will
insure
you
a
length
of
life
far
beyond
that
of
ordinary
mortals
an
additional
fee
of
twenty
dollars
is
charged
for
the
powder
i
decided
continued
watson
that
the
experience
was
worth
five
dollars
so
i
intimated
that
i
should
be
delighted
to
become
a
member
of
the
society
and
handed
mr
sing
five
dollars
whereupon
he
wrote
me
a
receipt
and
gave
me
a
member
card
which
stated
that
i
was
a
member
of
the
methuselah
club
of
the
second
class
and
entitled
to
receive
the
elixir
and
to
become
a
member
of
the
first
class
upon
the
further
payment
of
twenty
dollars
any
time
within
the
next
ten
days
after
which
if
i
had
not
been
made
a
member
of
the
first
class
my
name
should
be
dropped
from
the
rolls
rengee
sing
was
the
embodiment
of
courtesy
when
he
bowed
low
and
handed
me
my
receipt
dear
sir
he
said
shall
now
be
happy
to
explain
to
you
anything
that
i
can
would
like
i
said
possible
to
see
the
original
papyrus
which
i
understand
was
found
with
the
elixir
and
i
also
would
like
to
learn
more
fully
the
details
as
to
how
and
where
this
elixir
was
obtained
rengee
sing
bowed
and
going
to
the
corner
of
the
room
opened
a
small
fireproof
safe
taking
from
it
a
roll
of
what
proved
after
being
unrolled
to
be
an
ancient
papyrus
manuscript
written
in
the
sanscrit
language
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
it
seemed
to
be
the
original
of
which
the
printed
circular
was
a
translation
it
certainly
appeared
ancient
enough
manuscript
said
sing
the
box
of
powder
was
obtained
by
my
brother
and
given
to
me
at
his
death
he
died
from
the
effects
of
a
fall
from
his
horse
which
broke
three
ribs
and
otherwise
injured
him
internally
he
never
would
have
died
except
from
the
accident
as
he
had
taken
several
doses
of
the
elixir
just
how
long
it
will
enable
a
man
to
live
we
do
not
know
but
certainly
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
and
perhaps
even
two
hundred
years
he
obtained
it
in
the
following
manner
my
brother
had
long
been
desirous
of
visiting
lassa
which
is
as
you
know
the
wonderful
capital
of
thibet
but
was
unable
to
do
so
until
a
few
years
before
his
death
when
he
accompanied
a
hindoo
who
went
there
for
the
purpose
of
making
certain
reports
to
a
foreign
government
his
name
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
disclose
but
his
report
was
simply
signed
punjaub
my
dear
brother
described
lassa
to
me
very
minutely
and
from
all
accounts
it
must
be
the
most
wonderful
city
in
the
world
as
you
probably
know
no
european
or
christian
has
ever
been
allowed
to
enter
within
its
walls
according
to
my
brother
description
the
city
is
situated
in
a
fertile
plain
on
the
sampo
river
some
six
hundred
miles
north
of
calcutta
and
has
a
population
of
fully
sixty
thousand
persons
the
streets
are
wide
and
the
houses
have
their
walls
whitened
and
the
frames
of
the
doors
and
windows
colored
red
and
yellow
west
of
the
city
connected
with
it
by
a
splendid
avenue
is
the
mountain
of
buddha
where
now
stands
the
temple
of
the
grand
lama
this
temple
is
four
stories
high
and
therein
dwells
the
grand
lama
and
his
high
priests
some
idea
of
the
magnificence
of
this
temple
may
be
obtained
when
i
tell
you
that
its
great
pillars
are
covered
with
plates
of
pure
gold
the
grand
lama
can
live
forever
and
many
people
believe
he
does
so
but
he
really
does
not
after
a
certain
time
he
reincarnates
himself
into
a
new
body
all
of
the
priests
however
are
very
old
it
is
claimed
the
pandita
is
at
least
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
old
the
grand
lama
has
about
him
two
priests
of
the
highest
grades
one
the
pandita
and
the
other
tchoiji
the
grand
lama
sits
upon
an
altar
or
throne
for
hours
at
a
time
clothed
in
cloth
and
jewels
of
fabulous
value
over
his
head
is
a
magnificent
peacock
tail
composed
entirely
of
gold
and
precious
stones
it
is
the
custom
of
the
grand
lama
to
receive
persons
who
desire
to
receive
his
blessing
at
certain
hours
of
the
day
for
a
small
amount
of
money
one
is
allowed
to
bow
before
him
for
a
little
more
one
may
touch
his
garment
and
receive
his
silent
blessing
but
for
the
sum
of
twenty
rupees
he
will
speak
to
the
person
and
touch
him
with
a
little
wand
the
punjaub
in
describing
his
interview
states
that
the
grand
lama
talks
in
a
hoarse
voice
which
he
tries
to
make
as
much
as
possible
like
god
was
during
his
visit
to
the
temple
that
my
brother
learned
of
the
wonderful
treasures
preserved
there
fabulous
stories
being
told
about
a
huge
emerald
with
an
ancient
inscription
engraved
upon
it
the
mystic
seal
of
the
first
lama
which
had
been
handed
down
for
ages
together
with
the
greatest
treasure
of
them
all
known
as
the
elixir
of
life
wonderful
powder
was
and
is
used
by
the
high
priests
some
of
whom
are
of
great
age
it
is
supposed
to
have
been
brought
into
thibet
by
king
srongb
tsan
during
the
seventh
century
and
that
it
originally
came
from
nepaul
did
your
brother
procure
it
i
asked
bribing
one
of
the
priests
my
brother
was
wealthy
and
being
very
desirous
of
procuring
some
of
this
wonderful
powder
he
tried
to
buy
some
of
it
under
no
circumstances
however
would
they
listen
to
him
or
even
allow
him
to
see
it
he
succeeded
however
as
i
said
in
bribing
one
of
the
priests
paying
him
a
large
sum
of
money
several
hundred
rupees
i
believe
and
was
shown
the
sacred
chests
containing
this
powder
and
other
treasures
including
precious
manuscripts
and
some
jewels
of
great
value
the
powder
was
contained
in
five
little
gold
boxes
of
beautiful
workmanship
while
examining
them
they
heard
a
door
close
and
the
sounds
of
footsteps
in
the
passageway
the
priest
became
very
much
frightened
and
begged
my
brother
to
replace
the
boxes
and
manuscript
at
once
and
was
so
agitated
that
he
did
not
notice
my
brother
when
he
slipped
one
of
the
gold
boxes
into
his
pocket
the
person
whoever
he
was
passed
on
down
the
passageway
and
as
soon
as
they
dared
they
hurriedly
left
the
vault
luckily
for
my
brother
he
left
lassa
with
the
punjaub
that
evening
and
never
learned
whether
the
theft
was
discovered
or
not
probably
his
powder
would
have
done
him
little
good
had
it
been
so
and
had
he
been
suspected
how
i
asked
you
know
that
this
elixir
will
really
prolong
life
sing
smiled
sweetly
and
said
myself
my
dear
sir
am
a
living
proof
of
that
i
am
one
hundred
and
ten
years
old
and
there
are
in
new
york
some
sixty
men
who
will
live
to
that
age
having
taken
the
powder
unless
they
die
from
some
form
of
disease
this
elixir
will
not
protect
them
against
poison
or
diseases
where
the
poison
germ
has
entered
the
system
that
is
impossible
but
it
acts
upon
the
nerve
centres
and
upon
the
blood
corpuscles
in
such
a
wonderful
way
that
there
is
no
degeneration
the
person
simply
lives
along
the
same
as
he
would
between
the
ages
of
thirty
and
forty
he
is
always
the
same
he
may
die
from
many
causes
but
it
would
not
be
from
old
age
friend
i
said
the
liberty
to
analyze
some
of
this
powder
and
may
i
inquire
the
result
of
his
analysis
a
peculiar
yellow
light
came
into
those
eyes
and
although
he
smiled
have
you
ever
seen
a
caged
tiger
languidly
looking
at
the
crowd
of
people
in
front
of
his
cage
suddenly
discover
a
dog
near
him
i
do
know
that
i
have
said
robinson
well
if
you
do
you
will
notice
the
same
yellow
light
flash
into
his
eyes
and
the
sudden
change
of
expression
that
i
saw
in
the
eyes
of
our
friend
sing
it
was
gone
in
a
moment
however
and
he
was
again
smiling
sweetly
understand
he
found
it
to
consist
principally
of
common
salt
so
answered
sing
he
must
have
discovered
that
it
also
contained
something
else
is
true
i
answered
was
a
small
amount
of
vegetable
matter
which
gave
it
a
yellow
color
is
the
true
elixir
said
sing
is
merely
necessary
for
the
results
you
as
a
scientific
man
know
that
the
poison
which
kills
so
quickly
from
the
fang
of
a
cobra
and
the
ordinary
white
of
an
egg
can
hardly
be
distinguished
by
the
chemist
he
finds
them
both
to
be
albumen
then
should
one
kill
and
the
other
be
harmless
i
asked
the
minute
something
else
which
is
contained
in
the
snake
poison
and
which
is
held
in
solution
by
the
albumen
you
any
other
proof
of
the
power
of
this
elixir
i
inquired
dear
sir
i
trust
you
do
not
question
the
truth
of
my
statement
regarding
my
own
age
he
frowned
slightly
and
those
wonderful
eyes
of
his
glanced
like
lightning
towards
the
two
huge
attendants
standing
in
plain
sight
in
the
hallway
at
all
i
hastened
to
assure
him
all
seems
so
wonderful
to
me
you
must
excuse
my
apparent
incredulity
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
smiled
sing
with
grave
courtesy
i
will
let
your
own
eyes
banish
any
doubt
you
may
have
as
to
the
wonderful
properties
of
this
strange
powder
he
called
my
son
to
come
here
a
moment
if
he
will
be
so
good
the
attendant
who
had
spoken
to
me
when
i
entered
immediately
disappeared
and
in
a
moment
a
back
door
opened
and
the
bent
figure
of
a
very
old
man
entered
the
room
and
spoke
to
sing
in
a
weak
voice
the
language
was
evidently
hindustani
but
i
caught
a
word
here
and
there
which
sounded
familiar
sing
spoke
to
him
sharply
and
turning
to
me
said
is
my
son
he
is
nearly
eighty
years
old
but
refuses
to
take
the
powder
on
account
of
his
religious
principles
he
belongs
to
the
sect
who
believes
that
to
die
is
better
than
to
live
that
his
spirit
will
become
incarnate
in
another
body
and
in
his
next
life
he
will
be
at
least
a
kobtchie
my
eyes
must
have
betrayed
my
incredulity
do
not
doubt
that
he
is
my
son
sweetly
asked
mr
sing
not
i
answered
trust
then
that
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
furnishing
you
with
some
of
the
wonderful
powder
there
is
not
very
much
of
it
left
but
luckily
it
requires
a
very
small
dose
i
have
enough
probably
to
supply
one
hundred
men
to
insure
them
existence
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
when
that
is
gone
the
supply
can
never
be
replenished
he
sighed
you
i
answered
shall
think
the
matter
over
and
in
all
probability
give
myself
the
pleasure
of
calling
upon
you
again
then
i
came
away
being
bowed
out
by
the
sable
attendants
with
all
ceremony
possible
there
what
do
you
think
of
that
do
you
intend
to
return
and
purchase
the
powder
asked
robinson
perhaps
answered
watson
but
i
think
i
will
wait
awhile
and
see
if
jones
lives
to
be
one
hundred
and
fifty
the
voodoo
idol
jones
lay
on
the
sofa
watching
the
consul
mix
a
long
cool
drink
of
apollinaris
water
and
crushed
his
arm
pained
him
a
good
deal
and
the
bandages
felt
hot
and
uncomfortable
by
his
side
was
a
little
table
on
which
were
piled
numerous
articles
in
a
manner
common
to
mankind
among
which
were
a
bottle
of
whiskey
a
revolver
several
books
and
a
plate
containing
some
bananas
and
sapodillias
a
light
breeze
stirred
the
curtains
behind
him
and
under
the
awning
he
could
see
the
long
stretch
of
green
palms
and
waving
cocoanuts
back
of
the
city
a
faint
white
line
indicated
the
road
to
lecoup
i
tell
you
what
old
man
said
the
consul
as
he
poured
the
mixture
from
the
shaker
into
the
tall
thin
glasses
you
are
almightly
lucky
to
get
out
alive
and
you
took
big
chances
stealing
a
god
of
the
voodoo
priests
is
about
as
dangerous
an
experiment
as
playing
with
fire
over
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
from
your
description
i
should
judge
the
place
you
found
it
was
about
fifteen
miles
back
of
gantier
jones
nodded
in
silence
well
continued
the
consul
it
was
somewhere
in
that
vicinity
they
killed
that
frenchman
last
year
and
how
they
ever
let
you
get
out
alive
i
do
know
they
meant
to
kill
you
fast
enough
tried
to
poison
you
at
gantier
and
knocked
out
that
servant
of
yours
you
escaped
by
not
drinking
the
coffee
then
some
one
shot
at
you
on
the
road
and
even
then
you
did
not
have
sense
enough
to
throw
away
the
idol
but
even
if
you
had
i
do
know
that
it
would
have
made
any
difference
then
the
day
before
yesterday
they
put
a
bullet
through
your
arm
at
lecoup
and
if
old
chabeau
had
not
gone
himself
with
you
part
of
the
way
i
do
not
believe
you
would
ever
have
reached
here
alive
what
on
earth
made
you
monkey
with
that
idol
anyway
jones
explained
that
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
steal
it
he
had
been
camping
on
the
banks
of
a
nearly
dry
stream
ten
miles
or
more
east
of
gantier
where
he
had
found
the
little
hummingbird
the
smallest
bird
in
the
world
very
abundant
he
had
also
trapped
a
specimen
of
the
extremely
rare
and
being
anxious
to
procure
more
he
had
stayed
there
for
several
days
within
half
a
mile
of
his
camp
was
a
small
stone
tower
open
at
the
sides
in
the
middle
of
which
stood
a
little
idol
on
a
sort
of
pedestal
this
little
idol
was
about
eighteen
inches
high
and
was
carved
out
of
stone
the
eyes
oddly
enough
being
bone
jones
had
cast
longing
glances
on
this
idol
but
did
not
dare
to
touch
it
or
in
fact
to
go
into
the
tower
as
the
natives
were
sullen
and
suspicious
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
showed
signs
of
being
decidedly
ugly
jones
saw
enough
to
confirm
his
impression
that
these
people
were
a
bad
lot
and
one
dark
night
he
folded
his
tent
like
the
arabs
and
silently
stole
away
taking
with
him
as
a
souvenir
the
little
idol
which
he
had
carefully
rolled
in
a
blanket
and
packed
on
one
side
of
his
to
balance
his
box
of
specimens
on
the
other
fear
of
possible
unpleasant
consequences
had
caused
jones
to
ride
fast
but
he
had
been
followed
and
three
separate
attempts
made
on
his
life
by
unknown
persons
the
last
one
resulted
in
a
bullet
through
the
upper
part
of
the
left
arm
he
was
safe
enough
now
however
as
he
remarked
there
being
little
likelihood
of
danger
while
under
the
protection
of
the
american
consul
in
the
city
of
porto
prince
do
you
be
too
sure
of
that
said
the
consul
there
try
that
and
see
how
you
like
it
jones
sipped
the
cool
mixture
it
seemed
like
nectar
to
him
in
his
feverish
condition
the
bullet
which
had
passed
through
his
arm
had
made
a
wound
which
while
not
in
itself
serious
had
left
him
weak
and
feverish
yes
continued
the
consul
you
were
mighty
lucky
to
get
off
as
you
did
you
may
not
know
it
but
right
here
in
hayti
the
people
in
the
interior
are
as
savage
and
bloodthirsty
as
any
central
african
tribe
most
of
the
inhabitants
are
descendants
of
negroes
brought
from
the
gold
coast
many
years
ago
they
have
reverted
to
their
original
wild
state
keeping
up
many
of
the
ancient
customs
mixing
as
they
have
with
the
indians
of
the
interior
the
present
race
is
even
worse
than
their
ancestors
from
toussant
in
when
he
first
ruled
to
hyppolite
florvil
and
salomon
the
island
has
been
the
scene
of
continuous
insurrection
intrigue
and
murder
salomon
was
probably
the
best
of
them
all
he
was
an
immense
negro
some
six
feet
four
inches
tall
with
a
face
who
had
received
an
education
in
paris
and
married
a
frenchwoman
he
like
the
rest
however
was
superstitious
and
cruel
at
heart
hyppolite
was
a
voodoo
priest
and
it
is
said
an
anthropophagist
the
people
of
the
interior
have
an
intense
hatred
for
the
white
man
and
still
retain
many
of
the
barbarous
customs
of
the
savages
of
the
african
interior
the
voodoo
dance
is
presided
over
by
a
high
priest
who
usually
commands
a
goat
or
a
hen
to
be
killed
but
in
some
of
the
more
important
ceremonies
a
child
is
murdered
and
its
blood
mixed
with
the
and
drunk
by
the
dancers
the
high
priest
is
called
every
two
years
after
the
dance
of
the
moon
a
human
sacrifice
is
ordered
generally
a
young
girl
is
killed
and
eaten
you
probably
ran
up
against
one
of
the
voodoo
gods
and
the
large
stone
in
front
was
undoubtedly
the
sacrificial
stone
how
you
ever
got
away
alive
passes
my
comprehension
they
evidently
thought
that
you
would
try
to
leave
in
the
and
had
things
all
arranged
for
taking
a
shot
at
you
somewhere
but
your
nocturnal
skedaddle
knocked
their
plans
galley
west
there
is
one
thing
dead
sure
those
voodoo
priests
are
bad
medicine
as
we
used
to
say
out
west
and
you
want
to
keep
your
open
until
you
are
safe
on
board
a
steamer
and
out
of
the
harbor
i
give
five
cents
for
your
life
if
you
walked
about
the
streets
of
porto
prince
when
the
time
comes
to
leave
i
will
have
you
smuggled
on
board
the
authorities
would
wink
at
your
assassination
but
they
would
not
openly
countenance
it
jones
remarked
wearily
that
he
had
begun
to
believe
it
might
be
as
well
for
him
to
rest
quietly
in
the
consulate
and
not
give
them
another
chance
the
soft
breeze
blew
softly
in
through
the
open
window
and
was
soothing
to
jones
lying
there
on
the
lounge
with
his
eyes
closed
he
soon
fell
asleep
and
the
consul
left
him
to
attend
to
his
various
duties
when
jones
awoke
he
lay
in
a
sort
of
drowsy
condition
half
asleep
and
half
awake
through
his
partly
open
eyes
he
looked
through
the
open
door
leading
out
on
the
broad
piazza
there
was
a
chair
in
front
of
the
door
and
over
the
top
of
this
he
saw
a
face
and
a
pair
of
very
black
eyes
looking
at
him
intently
for
a
moment
he
imagined
it
was
some
freak
of
his
imagination
as
the
face
was
as
still
as
though
it
was
carved
in
wax
right
in
line
with
jones
eyes
and
within
a
foot
of
his
half
extended
arm
was
the
little
table
and
the
handle
of
the
revolver
seemed
to
stand
out
as
though
placed
there
for
his
especial
benefit
that
was
certainly
real
and
it
required
a
very
slight
movement
for
his
fingers
to
close
over
the
pistol
handle
but
he
did
not
move
and
lay
watching
the
figure
which
began
to
rise
slowly
and
developed
into
the
form
of
a
large
negro
jones
remembered
particularly
noticing
a
white
scar
across
the
cheek
just
under
the
eye
the
man
was
not
looking
at
him
now
but
was
glancing
about
with
the
stealthy
look
of
a
hunted
animal
at
the
same
time
he
drew
from
under
his
coat
a
long
knife
as
he
did
so
jones
lifted
his
pistol
and
aiming
hurriedly
at
the
breast
fired
the
man
dropped
grasping
at
the
chair
as
he
did
so
but
immediately
rose
to
his
feet
swaying
unsteadily
bang
went
jones
pistol
again
this
time
the
negro
did
not
fall
but
stood
seeming
half
dazed
steadying
himself
by
holding
on
to
the
back
of
the
chair
jones
fired
again
and
at
the
report
the
man
clapped
his
left
hand
tightly
over
his
heart
and
with
a
muttered
imprecation
threw
the
knife
at
jones
just
as
he
fired
his
fourth
shot
the
thud
of
the
knife
driving
deep
into
the
wood
close
to
jones
head
being
followed
by
the
sound
of
a
falling
body
on
the
hard
floor
as
the
consul
ran
into
the
room
followed
by
one
of
his
men
he
found
jones
sitting
on
the
lounge
pale
and
weak
from
excitement
and
fever
lucky
you
had
the
pistol
remarked
the
consul
might
have
been
unpleasant
see
that
gummy
green
stuff
on
the
knife
well
that
is
poison
and
a
mighty
bad
poison
too
one
little
scratch
but
all
well
that
ends
well
the
steamer
is
in
and
if
i
were
you
i
would
make
a
bee
line
for
the
pier
and
get
on
board
just
as
soon
as
the
lord
will
let
you
jones
rose
with
some
difficulty
and
went
out
upon
the
wide
balcony
on
the
blue
waters
of
the
bay
he
saw
a
large
steamer
and
at
her
stern
floating
in
the
breeze
the
most
beautiful
flag
in
the
world
the
stars
and
stripes
the
effect
on
him
in
his
half
hysterical
condition
was
to
make
him
want
to
cry
and
cheer
at
the
same
time
the
room
he
had
just
left
was
dark
in
contrast
to
the
bright
sunshine
outside
but
he
could
see
the
knife
and
the
dead
body
of
the
negro
from
which
a
narrow
dark
red
streak
was
slowly
making
its
way
across
the
floor
we
ca
go
any
too
quick
to
suit
me
said
jones
an
arizona
episode
wendell
harrison
was
a
club
man
with
no
ambition
in
life
beyond
making
his
small
income
pay
his
club
fees
and
leave
enough
for
him
to
live
in
the
manner
peculiar
to
young
men
of
his
class
his
one
hope
in
life
as
he
often
told
his
particular
crony
was
to
find
a
rich
wife
and
it
seemed
to
harrison
that
chance
had
played
into
his
hands
when
he
received
an
invitation
from
old
john
stiversant
to
join
his
party
on
a
trip
to
the
grand
cañon
in
northern
arizona
harrison
had
met
old
stiversant
on
the
yacht
of
a
mutual
friend
a
few
weeks
before
and
knowing
how
to
make
himself
agreeable
he
had
done
so
to
the
best
of
his
ability
with
the
result
that
he
had
been
asked
to
make
one
of
a
party
on
this
western
trip
in
stiversant
private
car
good
luck
to
you
old
man
said
his
chum
as
he
was
leaving
the
club
on
his
way
to
the
station
go
in
and
win
trust
me
for
that
answered
harrison
the
trip
out
proved
a
delightful
one
miss
nellie
stiversant
the
young
lady
who
harrison
had
decided
was
the
most
likely
catch
did
not
prove
as
easy
as
he
imagined
while
charming
and
agreeable
she
had
evidently
seen
more
or
less
of
the
world
and
was
not
to
be
gathered
in
by
the
first
man
who
made
up
his
mind
he
would
like
to
have
her
ornament
his
home
likewise
she
was
a
girl
with
common
sense
and
knowing
her
position
and
advantages
did
not
lose
her
head
when
a
man
showed
an
inclination
for
her
society
in
fact
just
before
the
party
arrived
in
flagstaff
she
had
made
it
very
evident
that
she
did
not
care
for
serious
attentions
from
any
one
she
was
however
of
a
decidedly
romantic
nature
and
harrison
pondered
deep
and
long
as
to
the
best
method
of
gaining
her
affections
late
that
evening
he
was
reading
a
sensational
novel
when
suddenly
he
laid
it
down
and
a
look
came
into
his
eyes
by
jove
he
muttered
the
very
thing
on
this
very
road
too
whether
the
story
is
true
or
not
it
is
reasonable
enough
although
a
trifle
dramatic
but
that
is
what
is
wanted
to
attract
a
girl
like
nell
she
do
care
for
me
and
never
will
and
all
she
wants
is
excitement
and
novelty
but
if
she
thinks
i
saved
her
life
or
risked
my
own
in
protecting
her
there
might
be
a
chance
in
this
story
the
chap
had
led
rather
a
tough
life
but
had
reformed
and
the
recognized
him
and
knew
he
meant
business
he
got
pretty
well
shot
up
but
the
whole
thing
cast
a
halo
around
him
which
would
undoubtedly
attract
any
romantic
girl
damn
it
why
could
i
do
it
it
is
that
or
nothing
the
trip
will
be
over
in
two
weeks
and
it
is
pretty
evident
that
i
am
not
in
it
unless
something
extraordinary
happens
ii
the
saloon
was
pretty
well
filled
with
a
sprinkling
of
miners
mexicans
and
ranchers
men
in
blue
overalls
flannel
shirts
and
hats
were
playing
the
different
games
of
chance
or
standing
in
groups
in
front
of
the
bar
a
harsh
piano
on
a
raised
platform
at
the
end
of
the
room
was
being
played
by
a
individual
in
a
dress
suit
and
a
young
lady
who
evidently
did
not
object
to
the
calsomining
process
to
aid
nature
was
singing
a
topical
song
in
the
corner
stood
wendell
harrison
surrounded
by
four
men
who
seemed
very
much
interested
in
what
he
was
saying
now
i
think
you
understand
thoroughly
what
is
required
said
harrison
i
am
to
pay
you
five
dollars
each
now
and
twenty
dollars
each
when
the
job
is
done
likewise
if
it
comes
off
successfully
and
the
bluff
works
i
am
to
give
you
twenty
dollars
more
upon
our
return
to
flagstaff
do
forget
to
carry
out
the
plan
exactly
as
we
have
agreed
when
i
spring
from
the
coach
waving
my
pistol
and
firing
blank
cartridges
one
of
you
is
to
shout
harrison
by
god
and
shoot
two
or
three
times
as
you
run
the
thing
is
easy
but
requires
a
little
judgment
i
do
not
care
where
you
stop
the
stage
stop
it
any
old
place
but
not
too
near
flagstaff
i
shall
be
alone
in
the
coach
with
an
old
man
and
two
young
girls
so
there
is
not
the
slightest
danger
and
i
will
see
that
the
old
man
is
unarmed
iii
say
jimmie
i
must
tell
yer
something
but
let
me
larf
first
say
i
nearly
fell
down
in
a
fit
i
am
going
to
tell
yer
all
about
it
but
do
call
me
a
liar
or
i
kill
yer
what
do
yer
think
oh
lord
how
my
stomach
aches
what
yer
think
wait
a
minute
i
tell
yer
in
a
minute
let
me
larf
it
out
now
or
i
shall
drop
down
right
here
say
i
sat
in
that
booth
over
there
having
a
quiet
drink
and
what
do
yer
think
a
dude
in
the
next
booth
commenced
putting
up
a
job
with
four
ducks
one
of
them
is
mexican
john
and
the
other
is
brady
our
assistant
here
as
far
as
i
can
make
it
out
brady
got
the
three
other
ducks
say
wait
a
minute
i
do
believe
i
ever
will
stop
larfin
what
do
yer
think
this
dude
is
going
up
to
the
cañon
on
my
next
trip
and
is
going
to
have
these
four
fellers
stop
the
stage
to
put
up
a
bluff
on
his
girl
to
show
what
a
fighter
he
is
and
he
is
to
give
um
twenty
dollars
each
he
is
going
to
jump
out
and
pull
his
gun
and
clean
out
the
crowd
and
then
go
back
and
bask
in
the
sunshine
and
admiration
of
the
young
girls
oh
lord
the
skunk
do
care
how
much
he
scares
the
girls
and
the
old
man
who
are
goin
along
but
all
he
wants
is
to
pose
as
a
fighter
from
away
back
but
say
jimmie
what
do
yer
think
i
have
been
thinkin
this
thing
over
and
i
do
believe
his
little
picnic
will
transpire
he
calculates
to
blow
in
eighty
dollars
to
make
a
monkey
of
himself
and
i
am
thinkin
that
we
can
use
that
eighty
dollars
in
our
business
and
teach
the
fellow
a
good
lesson
all
ter
wonce
what
breaks
me
up
more
than
anythin
is
that
he
told
brady
to
hunt
me
up
and
tell
me
on
the
quiet
that
there
was
a
reformed
desperado
going
with
me
who
used
to
be
known
by
the
name
of
harrison
worked
me
into
the
job
too
see
what
do
yer
think
iv
the
stage
was
slowly
toiling
up
a
dusty
hill
some
five
miles
from
flagstaff
the
road
was
rough
and
the
day
was
warm
the
let
the
horses
take
things
easy
and
from
time
to
time
shook
with
suppressed
emotion
i
hope
i
may
die
said
he
to
himself
if
this
ai
the
damndest
in
the
back
seats
the
two
young
girls
the
old
man
and
the
hero
were
enjoying
the
scenery
and
the
novelty
of
the
trip
in
spite
of
the
dust
suddenly
three
men
sprang
into
the
road
and
a
loud
voice
commanded
the
stage
to
hold
up
what
is
the
matter
asked
nellie
excitedly
do
be
afraid
said
wendell
pressing
her
hand
remember
i
am
with
you
a
man
appeared
at
the
side
of
the
stage
is
your
name
harrison
he
said
addressing
wendell
it
is
answered
harrison
boldly
what
do
you
want
i
have
a
bill
here
for
eighty
dollars
against
you
which
will
have
to
be
paid
or
you
will
have
to
get
out
and
go
back
to
town
with
me
what
do
you
mean
gasped
harrison
just
what
i
say
young
man
your
name
is
wendell
harrison
is
it
you
used
to
be
known
here
by
the
name
of
harrison
you
certainly
not
you
have
the
wrong
party
answered
harrison
indignantly
well
i
do
know
about
that
did
somebody
tell
you
that
this
fellow
was
harrison
bill
they
certainly
did
answered
the
it
is
all
a
mistake
said
harrison
mistake
or
not
you
will
have
to
pay
or
go
back
to
town
with
us
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
i
believe
you
are
the
harrison
i
want
oh
harrison
said
nell
do
pay
this
man
and
let
us
go
on
you
can
easily
recover
the
money
when
you
go
back
to
town
yes
said
stiversant
that
certainly
is
the
best
way
to
settle
the
matter
it
is
undoubtedly
a
case
of
mistaken
identity
but
this
man
is
evidently
acting
in
good
faith
and
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
straightening
matters
upon
your
return
at
flagstaff
harrison
face
was
very
red
and
he
looked
and
acted
ugly
but
this
man
evidently
meant
business
and
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
but
to
pay
the
money
which
he
did
with
a
very
bad
grace
taking
a
receipt
made
out
to
wendell
harrison
alias
fighting
harrison
of
arizona
an
exciting
incident
said
nell
as
the
party
rode
away
yes
said
harrison
but
one
that
might
just
as
well
have
been
left
out
of
the
programme
the
stage
moved
on
but
harrison
seemed
uneasy
every
few
minutes
he
mopped
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
and
pressed
his
hand
to
his
head
as
if
in
pain
visions
of
the
little
reception
committee
some
few
miles
ahead
were
constantly
in
his
mind
what
would
he
say
and
do
when
the
stage
was
stopped
and
he
received
his
cue
to
spring
out
and
fire
off
his
especially
as
he
had
only
fifteen
dollars
left
in
his
pocket
what
would
these
of
the
road
do
to
him
if
after
his
little
exhibit
of
bravery
he
failed
to
wind
up
the
melodrama
by
settling
with
the
actors
he
did
care
to
find
out
and
his
mind
was
bent
now
in
deciding
the
best
way
to
get
back
to
flagstaff
he
continued
mopping
his
face
and
once
or
twice
he
groaned
what
is
the
matter
asked
stiversant
are
you
ill
i
fear
so
answered
harrison
faintly
i
have
a
dull
pain
in
my
head
and
i
feel
faint
oh
let
us
go
back
said
nell
it
is
only
five
miles
and
we
can
start
again
just
as
well
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
said
harrison
weakly
i
fear
i
am
going
to
be
in
the
privacy
of
a
room
at
the
hotel
harrison
hastily
manufactured
an
urgent
telegram
calling
him
at
once
to
san
francisco
to
see
a
sick
uncle
and
had
barely
time
to
explain
matters
and
express
his
deep
regret
at
being
forced
to
leave
the
party
at
such
short
notice
an
hour
later
he
lay
back
in
a
luxurious
chair
in
the
smoking
compartment
of
the
california
limited
and
gazed
out
of
the
windows
at
the
vast
desert
plains
through
which
they
passed
his
eyes
had
a
look
in
them
and
ever
and
anon
he
sighed
far
up
the
grand
cañon
road
late
that
evening
brady
and
his
three
companions
still
sat
watching
sadly
for
the
stage
which
came
not
there
they
had
sat
in
the
burning
sun
without
food
or
water
since
ten
that
morning
they
did
not
speak
to
each
other
but
occasionally
they
cursed
sometimes
the
birds
sometimes
the
inanimate
things
about
them
at
times
they
thought
of
harrison
but
what
their
thoughts
were
no
one
will
ever
know
one
touch
of
nature
pretty
good
cigar
this
remarked
the
cowboy
the
eastern
man
nodded
nowadays
we
can
buy
good
ones
out
where
i
live
but
very
long
ago
when
good
cigars
were
as
rare
out
there
as
buffaloes
are
now
round
kansas
city
the
enormous
increase
in
population
in
some
of
your
western
cities
is
astonishing
remarked
the
eastern
man
the
cowboy
glanced
at
him
with
an
amused
smile
the
eastern
man
smiled
back
what
the
joke
he
asked
illustration
resting
his
head
on
the
cowboy
knee
oh
nothin
answered
the
cowboy
only
i
was
thinkin
maybe
you
did
live
out
west
no
i
am
a
new
yorker
answered
the
eastern
man
well
i
guess
they
raise
pretty
good
men
in
both
places
remarked
the
cowboy
our
late
war
proved
that
i
think
the
train
had
stopped
but
there
were
no
signs
of
a
station
although
two
or
three
rather
dilapidated
houses
and
a
typical
western
saloon
could
be
seen
a
short
distance
ahead
wonder
what
we
are
stopping
here
for
remarked
the
cowboy
it
strikes
me
we
been
here
a
pretty
long
time
just
then
the
porter
passed
the
door
of
the
smoking
compartment
and
the
cowboy
called
to
him
say
porter
what
the
matter
seems
to
me
we
have
been
stoppin
here
a
whole
lot
what
the
name
of
this
metropolis
it
mighty
lucky
you
got
whole
necks
answered
the
porter
the
eccentric
or
something
about
the
engine
is
broke
and
we
came
mighty
near
having
a
bad
accident
they
sent
on
for
another
engine
that
pleasant
remarked
the
eastern
man
how
long
do
you
think
we
shall
have
to
stay
here
before
the
other
engine
arrives
give
it
up
said
the
porter
maybe
an
hour
maybe
two
ca
tell
exactly
the
train
conductor
will
be
along
pretty
soon
and
he
will
know
all
about
it
guess
i
have
to
appoint
myself
a
committee
of
one
to
investigate
remarked
the
cowboy
he
arose
and
went
out
on
the
platform
of
the
car
followed
by
the
eastern
man
they
climbed
down
and
walked
forward
to
where
they
saw
a
crowd
gathered
about
the
engine
the
eccentric
rod
had
broken
short
off
and
had
the
engine
not
been
slowing
up
at
the
time
the
result
might
have
been
serious
the
two
men
strolled
down
the
track
for
a
short
distance
and
the
cowboy
discovered
a
small
colony
of
prairie
dogs
several
of
the
comical
little
creatures
were
sitting
on
their
hind
legs
on
the
mounds
beside
their
holes
ready
to
disappear
at
the
least
sign
of
danger
occasionally
one
would
run
from
one
hole
to
another
a
short
distance
away
usually
diving
out
of
sight
to
reappear
again
in
a
few
moments
when
satisfied
that
there
was
no
immediate
cause
for
alarm
the
cowboy
amused
himself
by
listlessly
throwing
small
stones
at
the
little
animals
after
a
few
moments
of
this
he
turned
to
the
eastern
man
and
said
say
i
am
goin
to
take
a
little
stroll
over
yonder
towards
that
luxurious
mansion
and
get
a
drink
from
the
well
want
to
go
along
with
pleasure
answered
the
eastern
man
the
two
strolled
slowly
towards
the
house
which
was
decidedly
in
need
of
repair
the
fence
surrounding
it
was
broken
down
in
many
places
weeds
and
grass
filled
the
little
yard
in
which
there
were
still
evidences
of
some
past
attempts
at
ornamentation
in
the
way
of
and
the
whole
place
gave
evidence
of
poverty
and
lack
of
care
on
the
porch
was
seated
a
girl
apparently
between
twelve
and
fourteen
years
of
age
she
was
hugging
an
immense
shaggy
dog
and
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
break
what
the
matter
sis
sympathetically
inquired
the
cowboy
oh
sir
sob
jake
goin
to
kill
my
rover
what
for
the
sobs
subsided
a
little
and
the
girl
looked
up
wiping
her
eyes
on
her
torn
apron
why
he
bited
jake
because
he
tried
to
kiss
me
and
i
did
want
him
to
and
they
are
goin
to
come
and
kill
him
who

to

purp

the
proper
caper
what
do

think
pardner
in
my
opinion
answered
the
eastern
man
the
dog

was
decidedly
laudatory
and
yer

same
as
i
do
that
the
pup
had

to
be
killed

it
decidedly
not

oh

me
the
girl
buried
her
face
in
the
shaggy
coat
of
her
friend
and
sobbed
the
cowboy
sat
down
on
the
step
beside
her
the
dog
eyed
him
inquiringly
but
evidently
decided
he
was
a
friend
and
wagged
his
tail
slightly
do

girl

the
cowboy

the
cowboy
snapped
his
fingers
at
the
dog
and
called
to
him
come
here
rover
the
splendid
animal
walked
solemnly
to
him
and
resting
his
head
on
his
knee
looked
up
steadily
into
his
face
do

to
be
too
savage
nor
nothin

of
dog

to

the
girl
had
stopped
crying
but
little
hysterical
sobs
choked
her
from
time
to
time
as
she
talked
the
cowboy
pulled
the
dog
ears
gently
and
the
animal
responded
by
licking
his
hand
seems
to
me
pardner
that
jake
ai
actin
quite
white
in
this
deal
it
an
outrage
warmly
responded
the
eastern
man
i
see
two
fellers
continued
the
cowboy
gently
stroking
the
head
comin
around
the
corner
of
the
house
maybe
we
better
ask
please
not
to
hurt
the
dog
i
agree
with
you
most
decidedly
the
girl
caught
sight
of
the
men
and
uttered
a
cry
of
fear
seizing
rover
by
the
collar
she
attempted
to
drag
him
inside
the
house
but
the
dog
braced
himself
and
growled
savagely
facing
the
newcomers
say
pard
remarked
the
cowboy
quietly
suppose
they
are
impolite
well
can
you
fight
i
can
try
bully
for
you
pard
that
the
stuff
shake
the
two
men
shook
hands
warmly
jake
and
his
companion
were
now
very
near
and
as
they
came
up
jake
pulled
a
large
revolver
from
its
holster
now
girl

away
from
that
dog
i
goin
to
shoot
him
and
i
want
to
hurt

the
girl
turned
white
but
she
placed
herself
in
front
of
rover
shielding
him
as
much
as
she
could
with
her
slender
body
hold
on
my
friend
interposed
the
cowboy

dog

to

sneered
jake
i

jake
with
an
evil
look
in
his
eyes
i
got
one
too
but
i
ai
pulled
it
yet
answered
the
cowboy
slowly
see
here
now
interposed
jake
companion
where
do
i
come
in
what
i
be
doin
all
the
time
when
you
smashin
up
my
pard
here
i
will
try
and
occupy
your
attention
quietly
said
the
eastern
man
the
hell
you
will
i
will
now
gentlemen
said
the
cowboy
we
do
want
no
trouble
but
there
is
a
peck
of
it
around
here
if
you
fellers
try
to
hurt
that
dog
the
dog
bit
yer
because
yer
tried
to
kiss
the
girl
and
he
served
you
damn
well
right
it
a
lie
interrupted
jake
sullenly
how
it
was
done
the
eastern
man
never
knew
but
jake
went
staggering
backward
and
when
he
recovered
himself
and
stood
with
the
blood
trickling
from
a
cut
under
his
eye
the
cowboy
had
him
covered
with
a
big
colt
and
the
eyes
which
looked
at
him
over
the
barrel
were
ugly
enough
to
make
a
gamer
man
than
jake
feel
uneasy
drop
yer
gun
jake
dropped
it
now
move
away
from
it
jake
did
so
the
cowboy
handed
his
big
pistol
to
the
eastern
man
and
walked
straight
up
to
jake
who
looked
decidedly
uncomfortable
now
take
it
back
or
i
smash
yer
face
said
the
cowboy
savagely
all
right
but
damn
you
if
it
war
that
my
leg
is
sore
where
the
dog
bit
me
i
fight
yer
till
i
could
see
the
cowboy
smiled
grimly
good
enough
now
get
out
of
here
wait
a
minute
interposed
the
eastern
man
may
i
make
a
suggestion
cert
pard
why
sure
answered
the
cowboy
well
it
seems
to
me
this
matter
had
better
be
settled
amicably
if
possible
if
not
after
we
are
gone
something
might
happen
to
the
dog
after
what
has
happened
the
gentleman
naturally
feels
an
animosity
towards
the
animal
now
i
would
suggest
that
he
name
a
sum
of
money
which
he
would
consider
sufficient
to
compensate
him
for
injuries
received
i
would
be
glad
to
pay
a
reasonable
amount
say
ten
dollars
in
settlement
of
all
damages
if
the
gentleman
will
agree
not
to
attempt
to
injure
the
dog
in
any
way
i
agree
to
that
cried
jake
eagerly
very
well
here
is
the
money
the
eastern
man
held
out
a
gold
piece
which
was
seized
upon
by
jake
and
without
a
word
he
and
his
companion
started
in
a
straight
line
for
the
saloon
the
cowboy
shouted
after
them
remember
i
be
back
here
next
week
and
if
the
dog
is
all
right
there
be
trouble
then
turning
to
the
girl
he
said
well

show

the
dog

right
so

guess

get
aboard
the
train
so
so
long
please

me
your
name

and
you
too
sir
turning
to
the
eastern
man
why

you
for

so
kind
ter
rover
and
me
oh
that
all
right
sis
do
think
of
it
the
cowboy
voice
was
husky
rover
old
boy
he
seized
the
big
dog
in
his
arms
and
turned
him
over
on
his
back
holding
him
down
the
dog
caught
one
of
the
man
hands
in
his
huge
mouth
and
chewed
it
gently
while
the
cowboy
poked
him
playfully
in
the
ribs
with
the
other
then
the
man
jumped
up
and
ran
for
the
car
with
rover
leaping
and
romping
about
him
uttering
great
deep
barks
of
joy
the
eastern
man
followed
more
slowly
a
cinder
or
something
had
got
into
his
eye
and
he
was
ostentatiously
wiping
it
out
with
the
corner
of
his
handkerchief
that
night
in
the
darkness
of
her
room
the
girl
knelt
by
the
side
of
her
rough
bed
and
whispered
softly
her
little
prayer
god
bless
mamma
god
bless
papa
god
bless
rover
and
bless
the
two
fellers
that
was
good
to
me
and

foot
goodnight

several
heavy
blows
on

answered
her
and
then
for
a
time
there
was
silence
the
wind
moaned
faintly
in
the
chimney
and
a
rat
squeaked
and
scampered
across
the

then
a

the

at
