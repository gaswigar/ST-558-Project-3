section
i
of
the
general
principles
of
morals
disputes
with
men
pertinaciously
obstinate
in
their
principles
are
of
all
others
the
most
irksome
except
perhaps
those
with
persons
entirely
disingenuous
who
really
do
not
believe
the
opinions
they
defend
but
engage
in
the
controversy
from
affectation
from
a
spirit
of
opposition
or
from
a
desire
of
showing
wit
and
ingenuity
superior
to
the
rest
of
mankind
the
same
blind
adherence
to
their
own
arguments
is
to
be
expected
in
both
the
same
contempt
of
their
antagonists
and
the
same
passionate
vehemence
in
inforcing
sophistry
and
falsehood
and
as
reasoning
is
not
the
source
whence
either
disputant
derives
his
tenets
it
is
in
vain
to
expect
that
any
logic
which
speaks
not
to
the
affections
will
ever
engage
him
to
embrace
sounder
principles
those
who
have
denied
the
reality
of
moral
distinctions
may
be
ranked
among
the
disingenuous
disputants
nor
is
it
conceivable
that
any
human
creature
could
ever
seriously
believe
that
all
characters
and
actions
were
alike
entitled
to
the
affection
and
regard
of
everyone
the
difference
which
nature
has
placed
between
one
man
and
another
is
so
wide
and
this
difference
is
still
so
much
farther
widened
by
education
example
and
habit
that
where
the
opposite
extremes
come
at
once
under
our
apprehension
there
is
no
scepticism
so
scrupulous
and
scarce
any
assurance
so
determined
as
absolutely
to
deny
all
distinction
between
them
let
a
man
insensibility
be
ever
so
great
he
must
often
be
touched
with
the
images
of
right
and
wrong
and
let
his
prejudices
be
ever
so
obstinate
he
must
observe
that
others
are
susceptible
of
like
impressions
the
only
way
therefore
of
converting
an
antagonist
of
this
kind
is
to
leave
him
to
himself
for
finding
that
nobody
keeps
up
the
controversy
with
him
it
is
probable
he
will
at
last
of
himself
from
mere
weariness
come
over
to
the
side
of
common
sense
and
reason
there
has
been
a
controversy
started
of
late
much
better
worth
examination
concerning
the
general
foundation
of
morals
whether
they
be
derived
from
reason
or
from
sentiment
whether
we
attain
the
knowledge
of
them
by
a
chain
of
argument
and
induction
or
by
an
immediate
feeling
and
finer
internal
sense
whether
like
all
sound
judgement
of
truth
and
falsehood
they
should
be
the
same
to
every
rational
intelligent
being
or
whether
like
the
perception
of
beauty
and
deformity
they
be
founded
entirely
on
the
particular
fabric
and
constitution
of
the
human
species
the
ancient
philosophers
though
they
often
affirm
that
virtue
is
nothing
but
conformity
to
reason
yet
in
general
seem
to
consider
morals
as
deriving
their
existence
from
taste
and
sentiment
on
the
other
hand
our
modern
enquirers
though
they
also
talk
much
of
the
beauty
of
virtue
and
deformity
of
vice
yet
have
commonly
endeavoured
to
account
for
these
distinctions
by
metaphysical
reasonings
and
by
deductions
from
the
most
abstract
principles
of
the
understanding
such
confusion
reigned
in
these
subjects
that
an
opposition
of
the
greatest
consequence
could
prevail
between
one
system
and
another
and
even
in
the
parts
of
almost
each
individual
system
and
yet
nobody
till
very
lately
was
ever
sensible
of
it
the
elegant
lord
shaftesbury
who
first
gave
occasion
to
remark
this
distinction
and
who
in
general
adhered
to
the
principles
of
the
ancients
is
not
himself
entirely
free
from
the
same
confusion
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
both
sides
of
the
question
are
susceptible
of
specious
arguments
moral
distinctions
it
may
be
said
are
discernible
by
pure
reason
else
whence
the
many
disputes
that
reign
in
common
life
as
well
as
in
philosophy
with
regard
to
this
subject
the
long
chain
of
proofs
often
produced
on
both
sides
the
examples
cited
the
authorities
appealed
to
the
analogies
employed
the
fallacies
detected
the
inferences
drawn
and
the
several
conclusions
adjusted
to
their
proper
principles
truth
is
disputable
not
taste
what
exists
in
the
nature
of
things
is
the
standard
of
our
judgement
what
each
man
feels
within
himself
is
the
standard
of
sentiment
propositions
in
geometry
may
be
proved
systems
in
physics
may
be
controverted
but
the
harmony
of
verse
the
tenderness
of
passion
the
brilliancy
of
wit
must
give
immediate
pleasure
no
man
reasons
concerning
another
beauty
but
frequently
concerning
the
justice
or
injustice
of
his
actions
in
every
criminal
trial
the
first
object
of
the
prisoner
is
to
disprove
the
facts
alleged
and
deny
the
actions
imputed
to
him
the
second
to
prove
that
even
if
these
actions
were
real
they
might
be
justified
as
innocent
and
lawful
it
is
confessedly
by
deductions
of
the
understanding
that
the
first
point
is
ascertained
how
can
we
suppose
that
a
different
faculty
of
the
mind
is
employed
in
fixing
the
other
on
the
other
hand
those
who
would
resolve
all
moral
determinations
into
sentiment
may
endeavour
to
show
that
it
is
impossible
for
reason
ever
to
draw
conclusions
of
this
nature
to
virtue
say
they
it
belongs
to
be
amiable
and
vice
odious
this
forms
their
very
nature
or
essence
but
can
reason
or
argumentation
distribute
these
different
epithets
to
any
subjects
and
pronounce
beforehand
that
this
must
produce
love
and
that
hatred
or
what
other
reason
can
we
ever
assign
for
these
affections
but
the
original
fabric
and
formation
of
the
human
mind
which
is
naturally
adapted
to
receive
them
the
end
of
all
moral
speculations
is
to
teach
us
our
duty
and
by
proper
representations
of
the
deformity
of
vice
and
beauty
of
virtue
beget
correspondent
habits
and
engage
us
to
avoid
the
one
and
embrace
the
other
but
is
this
ever
to
be
expected
from
inferences
and
conclusions
of
the
understanding
which
of
themselves
have
no
hold
of
the
affections
or
set
in
motion
the
active
powers
of
men
they
discover
truths
but
where
the
truths
which
they
discover
are
indifferent
and
beget
no
desire
or
aversion
they
can
have
no
influence
on
conduct
and
behaviour
what
is
honourable
what
is
fair
what
is
becoming
what
is
noble
what
is
generous
takes
possession
of
the
heart
and
animates
us
to
embrace
and
maintain
it
what
is
intelligible
what
is
evident
what
is
probable
what
is
true
procures
only
the
cool
assent
of
the
understanding
and
gratifying
a
speculative
curiosity
puts
an
end
to
our
researches
extinguish
all
the
warm
feelings
and
prepossessions
in
favour
of
virtue
and
all
disgust
or
aversion
to
vice
render
men
totally
indifferent
towards
these
distinctions
and
morality
is
no
longer
a
practical
study
nor
has
any
tendency
to
regulate
our
lives
and
actions
these
arguments
on
each
side
and
many
more
might
be
produced
are
so
plausible
that
i
am
apt
to
suspect
they
may
the
one
as
well
as
the
other
be
solid
and
satisfactory
and
that
reason
and
sentiment
concur
in
almost
all
moral
determinations
and
conclusions
the
final
sentence
it
is
probable
which
pronounces
characters
and
actions
amiable
or
odious
or
blameable
that
which
stamps
on
them
the
mark
of
honour
or
infamy
approbation
or
censure
that
which
renders
morality
an
active
principle
and
constitutes
virtue
our
happiness
and
vice
our
misery
it
is
probable
i
say
that
this
final
sentence
depends
on
some
internal
sense
or
feeling
which
nature
has
made
universal
in
the
whole
species
for
what
else
can
have
an
influence
of
this
nature
but
in
order
to
pave
the
way
for
such
a
sentiment
and
give
a
proper
discernment
of
its
object
it
is
often
necessary
we
find
that
much
reasoning
should
precede
that
nice
distinctions
be
made
just
conclusions
drawn
distant
comparisons
formed
complicated
relations
examined
and
general
facts
fixed
and
ascertained
some
species
of
beauty
especially
the
natural
kinds
on
their
first
appearance
command
our
affection
and
approbation
and
where
they
fail
of
this
effect
it
is
impossible
for
any
reasoning
to
redress
their
influence
or
adapt
them
better
to
our
taste
and
sentiment
but
in
many
orders
of
beauty
particularly
those
of
the
finer
arts
it
is
requisite
to
employ
much
reasoning
in
order
to
feel
the
proper
sentiment
and
a
false
relish
may
frequently
be
corrected
by
argument
and
reflection
there
are
just
grounds
to
conclude
that
moral
beauty
partakes
much
of
this
latter
species
and
demands
the
assistance
of
our
intellectual
faculties
in
order
to
give
it
a
suitable
influence
on
the
human
mind
but
though
this
question
concerning
the
general
principles
of
morals
be
curious
and
important
it
is
needless
for
us
at
present
to
employ
farther
care
in
our
researches
concerning
it
for
if
we
can
be
so
happy
in
the
course
of
this
enquiry
as
to
discover
the
true
origin
of
morals
it
will
then
easily
appear
how
far
either
sentiment
or
reason
enters
into
all
determinations
of
this
nature
footnote
see
appendix
i
in
order
to
attain
this
purpose
we
shall
endeavour
to
follow
a
very
simple
method
we
shall
analyse
that
complication
of
mental
qualities
which
form
what
in
common
life
we
call
personal
merit
we
shall
consider
every
attribute
of
the
mind
which
renders
a
man
an
object
either
of
esteem
and
affection
or
of
hatred
and
contempt
every
habit
or
sentiment
or
faculty
which
if
ascribed
to
any
person
implies
either
praise
or
blame
and
may
enter
into
any
panegyric
or
satire
of
his
character
and
manners
the
quick
sensibility
which
on
this
head
is
so
universal
among
mankind
gives
a
philosopher
sufficient
assurance
that
he
can
never
be
considerably
mistaken
in
framing
the
catalogue
or
incur
any
danger
of
misplacing
the
objects
of
his
contemplation
he
needs
only
enter
into
his
own
breast
for
a
moment
and
consider
whether
or
not
he
should
desire
to
have
this
or
that
quality
ascribed
to
him
and
whether
such
or
such
an
imputation
would
proceed
from
a
friend
or
an
enemy
the
very
nature
of
language
guides
us
almost
infallibly
in
forming
a
judgement
of
this
nature
and
as
every
tongue
possesses
one
set
of
words
which
are
taken
in
a
good
sense
and
another
in
the
opposite
the
least
acquaintance
with
the
idiom
suffices
without
any
reasoning
to
direct
us
in
collecting
and
arranging
the
estimable
or
blameable
qualities
of
men
the
only
object
of
reasoning
is
to
discover
the
circumstances
on
both
sides
which
are
common
to
these
qualities
to
observe
that
particular
in
which
the
estimable
qualities
agree
on
the
one
hand
and
the
blameable
on
the
other
and
thence
to
reach
the
foundation
of
ethics
and
find
those
universal
principles
from
which
all
censure
or
approbation
is
ultimately
derived
as
this
is
a
question
of
fact
not
of
abstract
science
we
can
only
expect
success
by
following
the
experimental
method
and
deducing
general
maxims
from
a
comparison
of
particular
instances
the
other
scientific
method
where
a
general
abstract
principle
is
first
established
and
is
afterwards
branched
out
into
a
variety
of
inferences
and
conclusions
may
be
more
perfect
in
itself
but
suits
less
the
imperfection
of
human
nature
and
is
a
common
source
of
illusion
and
mistake
in
this
as
well
as
in
other
subjects
men
are
now
cured
of
their
passion
for
hypotheses
and
systems
in
natural
philosophy
and
will
hearken
to
no
arguments
but
those
which
are
derived
from
experience
it
is
full
time
they
should
attempt
a
like
reformation
in
all
moral
disquisitions
and
reject
every
system
of
ethics
however
subtle
or
ingenious
which
is
not
founded
on
fact
and
observation
we
shall
begin
our
enquiry
on
this
head
by
the
consideration
of
the
social
virtues
benevolence
and
justice
the
explication
of
them
will
probably
give
us
an
opening
by
which
the
others
may
be
accounted
for
section
ii
of
benevolence
part
i
it
may
be
esteemed
perhaps
a
superfluous
task
to
prove
that
the
benevolent
or
softer
affections
are
estimable
and
wherever
they
appear
engage
the
approbation
and
of
mankind
the
epithets
sociable
humane
merciful
grateful
friendly
generous
beneficent
or
their
equivalents
are
known
in
all
languages
and
universally
express
the
highest
merit
which
human
nature
is
capable
of
attaining
where
these
amiable
qualities
are
attended
with
birth
and
power
and
eminent
abilities
and
display
themselves
in
the
good
government
or
useful
instruction
of
mankind
they
seem
even
to
raise
the
possessors
of
them
above
the
rank
of
human
nature
and
make
them
approach
in
some
measure
to
the
divine
exalted
capacity
undaunted
courage
prosperous
success
these
may
only
expose
a
hero
or
politician
to
the
envy
and
of
the
public
but
as
soon
as
the
praises
are
added
of
humane
and
beneficent
when
instances
are
displayed
of
lenity
tenderness
or
friendship
envy
itself
is
silent
or
joins
the
general
voice
of
approbation
and
applause
when
pericles
the
great
athenian
statesman
and
general
was
on
his
his
surrounding
friends
deeming
him
now
insensible
began
to
indulge
their
sorrow
for
their
expiring
patron
by
enumerating
his
great
qualities
and
successes
his
conquests
and
victories
the
unusual
length
of
his
administration
and
his
nine
trophies
erected
over
the
enemies
of
the
republic
you
forget
cries
the
dying
hero
who
had
heard
all
you
forget
the
most
eminent
of
my
praises
while
you
dwell
so
much
on
those
vulgar
advantages
in
which
fortune
had
a
principal
share
you
have
not
observed
that
no
citizen
has
ever
yet
worne
mourning
on
my
account
plut
in
pericle
in
men
of
more
ordinary
talents
and
capacity
the
social
virtues
become
if
possible
still
more
essentially
requisite
there
being
nothing
eminent
in
that
case
to
compensate
for
the
want
of
them
or
preserve
the
person
from
our
severest
hatred
as
well
as
contempt
a
high
ambition
an
elevated
courage
is
apt
says
cicero
in
less
perfect
characters
to
degenerate

the
principal
advantage
which
juvenal
discovers
in
the
extensive
capacity
of
the
human
species
is
that
it
renders
our
benevolence
also
more
extensive
and
gives
us
larger
opportunities
of
spreading
our
kindly
influence
than
what
are
indulged

the

and
it
must
indeed
be
confessed
that
by
doing
good
only
can
a
man
truly
enjoy
the
advantages
of
being
eminent
his
exalted
station
of
itself
but
the
more
exposes
him
to
danger
and
tempest
his
sole
prerogative
is
to
afford
shelter
to
inferiors
who
repose
themselves
under
his
cover
and
protection
but
i
forget
that
it
is
not
my
present
business
to
recommend
generosity
and
benevolence
or
to
paint
in
their
true
colours
all
the
genuine
charms
of
the
social
virtues
these
indeed
sufficiently
engage
every
heart
on
the
first
apprehension
of
them
and
it
is
difficult
to
abstain
from
some
sally
of
panegyric
as
often
as
they
occur
in
discourse
or
reasoning
but
our
object
here
being
more
the
speculative
than
the
practical
part
of
morals
it
will
suffice
to
remark
what
will
readily
i
believe
be
allowed
that
no
qualities
are
more
intitled
to
the
general
and
approbation
of
mankind
than
beneficence
and
humanity
friendship
and
gratitude
natural
affection
and
public
spirit
or
whatever
proceeds
from
a
tender
sympathy
with
others
and
a
generous
concern
for
our
kind
and
species
these
wherever
they
appear
seem
to
transfuse
themselves
in
a
manner
into
each
beholder
and
to
call
forth
in
their
own
behalf
the
same
favourable
and
affectionate
sentiments
which
they
exert
on
all
around
part
ii
we
may
observe
that
in
displaying
the
praises
of
any
humane
beneficent
man
there
is
one
circumstance
which
never
fails
to
be
amply
insisted
on
namely
the
happiness
and
satisfaction
derived
to
society
from
his
intercourse
and
good
offices
to
his
parents
we
are
apt
to
say
he
endears
himself
by
his
pious
attachment
and
duteous
care
still
more
than
by
the
connexions
of
nature
his
children
never
feel
his
authority
but
when
employed
for
their
advantage
with
him
the
ties
of
love
are
consolidated
by
beneficence
and
friendship
the
ties
of
friendship
approach
in
a
fond
observance
of
each
obliging
office
to
those
of
love
and
inclination
his
domestics
and
dependants
have
in
him
a
sure
resource
and
no
longer
dread
the
power
of
fortune
but
so
far
as
she
exercises
it
over
him

him

ignorant
and
slothful

cheers
invigorates
and
sustains
the
surrounding
world
if
confined
to
private
life
the
sphere
of
his
activity
is
narrower
but
his
influence
is
all
benign
and
gentle
if
exalted
into
a
higher
station
mankind
and
posterity
reap
the
fruit
of
his
labours
as
these
topics
of
praise
never
fail
to
be
employed
and
with
success
where
we
would
inspire
esteem
for
any
one
may
it
not
thence
be
concluded
that
the
utility
resulting
from
the
social
virtues
forms
at
least
a
part
of
their
merit
and
is
one
source
of
that
approbation
and
regard
so
universally
paid
to
them
when
we
recommend
even
an
animal
or
a
plant
as
useful
and
beneficial
we
give
it
an
applause
and
recommendation
suited
to
its
nature
as
on
the
other
hand
reflection
on
the
baneful
influence
of
any
of
these
inferior
beings
always
inspires
us
with
the
sentiment
of
aversion
the
eye
is
pleased
with
the
prospect
of

loaded
horses
grazing
and
flocks
pasturing

flies

view

briars

brambles

a

contrived

with

an

here
sensible
to
many
excellencies
which
escape
persons
ignorant
and
uninstructed
can
anything
stronger
be
said
in
praise
of
a
profession
such
as

observe
the
advantages
which
it
procures
to

by

giving

carry

when

arising

we
regard
that
species
of
charity
rather
as
a
weakness
than
a
virtue
tyrannicide
or
the
assassination
of
usurpers
and
oppressive
princes
was
highly
extolled
in
ancient
times

it
both
freed
mankind
from
many
of
these
monsters
and
seemed
to
keep
the
others
in
awe
whom
the
sword

could
not
reach
but
history
and

since
convinced
us
that
this
practice
increases
the
jealousy

cruelty
of
princes
a
timoleon
and
a

though
treated
with
indulgence
on
account
of
the
prejudices
of

times
are
now
considered
as
very
improper
models
for
imitation
liberality
in
princes
is
regarded
as
a
mark
of
beneficence
but
when
it
occurs
that
the
homely
bread
of
the
honest
and
industrious
is
often
thereby
converted
into
delicious
cates
for
the
idle
and
the
prodigal
we
soon
retract
our
heedless
praises
the
regrets
of
a
prince
for
having
lost
a
day
were
noble
and
generous
but
had
he
intended
to
have
spent
it
in
acts
of
generosity
to
his
greedy
courtiers
it
was
better
lost
than
misemployed
after
that
manner
luxury
or
a
refinement
on
the
pleasures
and

not
long
been
supposed
the
source
of

corruption
in
government
and
the
immediate
cause
of
faction

civil
wars
and
the
total
loss
of

it
was
therefore
universally
regarded
as
a
vice
and
was
an
object
of
declamation
to
all
satirists
and
severe
moralists
those
who
prove
or
attempt
to
prove
that
such
refinements
rather
tend
to
the
increase
of
industry
civility
and
arts
regulate
anew
our
moral
as
well
as
political
sentiments
and
represent
as
laudable
or
innocent
what
had
formerly
been
regarded
as
pernicious
and
blameable
upon
the
whole
then
it
seems
undeniable
that
nothing
can
bestow
more
merit
on
any
human
creature
than
the
sentiment
of
benevolence
in
an
eminent
degree
and
that
a
part
at

of
its
merit
arises
from
its
tendency
to
promote
the
interests
of

bestow

on
human

we
carry

and
disposition

whatever
has
so
benign
an
influence
and

so
desirable

the

imprudent
generosity
why
raise
landmarks
between
my

when
my
heart
has
made
no
division

our
interests

shares
all
his
joys
and
sorrows
with
the

force
and
vivacity
as
if
originally
my
own
every
man
upon
this
supposition
being
a
second
self
to
another
would
trust
all
his
interests
to
the
discretion
of
every
man
without
jealousy
without
partition
without
distinction
and
the
whole
human
race
would
form
only
one
family
where
all
would
lie
in
common
and
be
used
freely
without
regard
to
property
but
cautiously
too
with
as
entire
regard
to
the
necessities
of
each
individual
as
if
our
own
interests
were
most
intimately
concerned
in
the
present
disposition
of
the
human
heart
it
would
perhaps
be
difficult
to
find
complete
instances
of
such
enlarged
affections
but
still
we
may
observe
that
the
case
of
families
approaches
towards
it
and
the
stronger
the
mutual
benevolence
is
among
the
individuals
the
nearer
it
approaches
till
all
distinction
of
property
be
in
a
great
measure
lost
and
confounded
among
them
between
married
persons
the
cement
of
friendship
is
by
the
laws
supposed
so
strong
as
to
abolish
all
division
of
possessions
and
has
often
in
reality
the
force
ascribed
to
it
and
it
is
observable
that
during
the
ardour
of
new
enthusiasms
when
every
principle
is
inflamed
into
extravagance
the
community
of
goods
has
frequently
been
attempted
and
nothing
but
experience
of
its
inconveniencies
from
the
returning
or
disguised
selfishness
of
men
could
make
the
imprudent
fanatics
adopt
anew
the
ideas
of
justice
and
of
separate
property
so
true
is
it
that
this
virtue
derives
its
existence
entirely
from
its
necessary
use
to
the
intercourse
and
social
state
of
mankind
to
make
this
truth
more
evident
let
us
reverse
the
foregoing
suppositions
and
carrying
everything
to
the
opposite
extreme
consider
what
would
be
the
effect
of
these
new
situations
suppose
a
society
to
fall
into
such
want
of
all
common
necessaries
that
the
utmost
frugality
and
industry
can
not
preserve
the
greater
number
from
perishing
and
the
whole
from
extreme
misery
it
will
readily
i
believe
be
admitted
that
the
strict
laws
of
justice
are
suspended
in
such
a
pressing
emergence
and
give
place
to
the
stronger
motives
of
necessity
and
is
it
any
crime
after
a
shipwreck
to
seize
whatever
means
or
instrument
of
safety
one
can
lay
hold
of
without
regard
to
former
limitations
of
property
or
if
a
city
besieged
were
perishing
with
hunger
can
we
imagine
that
men
will
see
any
means
of
preservation
before
them
and
lose
their
lives
from
a
scrupulous
regard
to
what
in
other
situations
would
be
the
rules
of
equity
and
justice
the
use
and
tendency
of
that
virtue
is
to
procure
happiness
and
security
by
preserving
order
in
society
but
where
the
society
is
ready
to
perish
from
extreme
necessity
no
greater
evil
can
be
dreaded
from
violence
and
injustice
and
every
man
may
now
provide
for
himself
by
all
the
means
which
prudence
can
dictate
or
humanity
permit
the
public
even
in
less
urgent
necessities
opens
granaries
without
the
consent
of
proprietors
as
justly
supposing
that
the
authority
of
magistracy
may
consistent
with
equity
extend
so
far
but
were
any
number
of
men
to
assemble
without
the
tie
of

or
civil
jurisdiction
would
an
equal
partition
of

in
a
famine
though
effected
by
power
and
even
violence

regarded
as
criminal
or
injurious
suppose
likewise
that
it
should
be
a
virtuous
man
fate
to
fall
into
the
society
of
ruffians
remote
from
the
protection
of
laws
and
government
what
conduct
must
he
embrace
in
that
melancholy
situation
he
sees
such
a
desperate
rapaciousness
prevail
such
a
disregard
to
equity
such
contempt
of
order
such
stupid
blindness
to
future
consequences
as
must
immediately
have
the
most
tragical
conclusion
and
must
terminate
in
destruction
to
the
greater
number
and
in
a
total
dissolution
of
society
to
the
rest
he
meanwhile
can
have
no
other
expedient
than
to
arm
himself
to
whomever
the
sword
he
seizes
or
the
buckler
may
belong
to
make
provision
of
all
means
of
defence
and
security
and
his
particular
regard
to
justice
being
no
longer
of
use
to
his
own
safety
or
that
of
others
he
must
consult
the
dictates
of
alone
without
concern
for
those
who
no
longer
merit
his
care
and
attention
when
any
man
even
in
political
society
renders
himself
by
his
crimes
obnoxious
to
the
public
he
is
punished
by
the
laws
in
his
goods
and
person
that
is
the
ordinary
rules
of
justice
are
with
regard
to
him
suspended
for
a
moment
and
it
becomes
equitable
to
inflict
on
him
for
the
benefit
of
society
what
otherwise
he
could
not
suffer
without
wrong
or
injury
the
rage
and
violence
of
public
war
what
is
it
but
a
suspension
of
justice
among
the
warring
parties
who
perceive
that
this
virtue
is
now
no
longer
of
any
use
or
advantage
to
them
the
laws
of
war
which
then
succeed
to
those
of
equity
and
justice
are
rules
calculated
for
the
advantage
and
utility
of
that
particular
state
in
which
men
are
now
placed
and
were
a
civilized
nation
engaged
with
barbarians
who
observed
no
rules
even
of
war
the
former
must
also
suspend
their
observance
of
them
where
they
no
longer
serve
to
any
purpose
and
must
render
every
action
or
recounter
as
bloody
and
pernicious
as
possible
to
the
first
aggressors
thus
the
rules
of
equity
or
justice
depend
entirely
on
the
particular
state
and
condition
in
which
men
are
placed
and
owe
their
origin
and
existence
to
that
utility
which
results
to
the
public
from
their
strict
and
regular
observance
reverse
in
any
considerable
circumstance
the
condition
of
men
produce
extreme
abundance
or
extreme
necessity
implant
in
the
human
breast
perfect
moderation
and
humanity
or
perfect
rapaciousness
and
malice
by
rendering
justice
totally
useless
you
thereby
totally
destroy
its
essence
and
suspend
its
obligation
upon
mankind
the
common
situation
of
society
is
a
medium
amidst
all
these
extremes
we
are
naturally
partial
to
ourselves
and
to
our
friends
but
are
capable
of
learning
the
advantage
resulting
from
a
more
equitable
conduct
few
enjoyments
are
given
us
from
the
open
and
liberal
hand
of
nature
but
by
art
labour
and
industry
we
can
extract
them
in
great
abundance
hence
the
ideas
of
property
become
necessary
in
all
civil
society
hence
justice
derives
its
usefulness
to
the
public
and
hence
alone
arises
its
merit
and
moral
obligation
these
conclusions
are
so
natural
and
obvious
that
they
have
not
escaped
even
the
poets
in
their
descriptions
of
the
felicity
attending
the
golden
age
or
the
reign
of
saturn
the
seasons
in
that
first
period
of
nature
were
so
temperate
if
we
credit
these
agreeable
fictions
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
men
to
provide
themselves
with
clothes
and
houses
as
a
security
against
the
violence
of
heat
and
cold
the
rivers
flowed
with
wine
and
milk
the
oaks
yielded
honey
and
nature
spontaneously
produced
her
greatest
delicacies
nor
were
these
the
chief
advantages
of
that
happy
age
tempests
were
not
alone
removed
from
nature
but
those
more
furious
tempests
were
unknown
to
human
breasts
which
now
cause
such
uproar
and
engender
such
confusion
avarice
ambition
cruelty
selfishness
were
never
heard
of
cordial
affection
compassion
sympathy
were
the
only
movements
with
which
the
mind
was
yet
acquainted
even
the
punctilious
distinction
of
mine
and
thine
was
banished
from
among
the
happy
race
of
mortals
and
carried
with
it
the
very
notion
of
property
and
obligation
justice
and
injustice
this
poetical
fiction
of
the
golden
age
is
in
some
respects
of
a
piece
with
the
philosophical
fiction
of
the
state
of
nature
only
that
the
former
is
represented
as
the
most
charming
and
most
peaceable
condition
which
can
possibly
be
imagined
whereas
the
latter
is
painted
out
as
a
state
of
mutual
war
and
violence
attended
with
the
most
extreme
necessity
on
the
first
origin
of
mankind
we
are
told
their
ignorance
and
savage
nature
were
so
prevalent
that
they
could
give
no
mutual
trust
but
must
each
depend
upon
himself
and
his
own
force
or
cunning
for
protection
and
security
no
law
was
heard
of
no
rule
of
justice
known
no
distinction
of
property
regarded
power
was
the
only
measure
of
right
and
a
perpetual
war
of
all
against
all
was
the
result
of
untamed
selfishness
and
barbarity
footnote
this
fiction
of
a
state
of
nature
as
a
state
of
war
was
not

started
by
hobbes

is
commonly
imagined
plato
endeavours
to
refute
an
hypothesis

like
it
in
the
second

and

the

supposes
it
certain
and
universally

in

whether
such
a
condition
of
human
nature
could
ever
exist
or
if
it
did
could
continue
so
long
as
to
merit
the
appellation
of
a
state
may
justly
be
doubted
men
are
necessarily
born
in
a
at
least
and
are
trained
up
by
their
parents
to
some
rule
of
conduct
and
behaviour
but
this
must
be
admitted
that
if
such
a
state
of
mutual
war
and
violence
was
ever
real
the
suspension
of
all
laws
of
justice
from
their
absolute
inutility
is
a
necessary
and
infallible
consequence
the
more
we
vary
our
views
of
human
life
and
the
newer
and
more
unusual
the
lights
are
in
which
we
survey
it
the
more
shall
we
be
convinced
that
the
origin
here
assigned
for
the
virtue
of
justice
is
real
and
satisfactory
were
there
a
species
of
creatures
intermingled
with
men
which
though
rational
were
possessed
of
such
inferior
strength
both
of
body
and
mind
that
they
were
incapable
of
all
resistance
and
could
never
upon
the
highest
provocation
make
us
feel
the
effects
of
their
resentment
the
necessary
consequence
i
think
is
that
we
should
be
bound
by
the
laws
of
humanity
to
give
gentle
usage
to
these
creatures
but
should
not
properly
speaking
lie
under
any
restraint
of
justice
with
regard
to
them
nor
could
they
possess
any
right
or
property
exclusive
of
such
arbitrary
lords
our
intercourse
with
them
could
not
be
called
society
which
supposes
a
degree
of
equality
but
absolute
command
on
the
one
side
and
servile
obedience
on
the
other
whatever
we
covet
they
must
instantly
resign
our
permission
is
the
only
tenure
by
which
they
hold
their
possessions
our
compassion
and
kindness
the
only
check
by
which
they
curb
our
lawless
will
and
as
no
inconvenience
ever
results
from
the
exercise
of
a
power
so
firmly
established
in
nature
the
restraints
of
justice
and
property
being
totally
useless
would
never
have
place
in
so
unequal
a
confederacy
this
is
plainly
the
situation
of
men
with
regard
to
animals
and
how
far
these
may
be
said
to
possess
reason
i
leave
it
to
others
to
determine
the
great
superiority
of
civilized
europeans
above
barbarous
indians
tempted
us
to
imagine
ourselves
on
the
same
footing
with
regard
to
them
and
made
us
throw
off
all
restraints
of
justice
and
even
of
humanity
in
our
treatment
of
them
in
many
nations
the
female
sex
are
reduced
to
like
slavery
and
are
rendered
incapable
of
all
property
in
opposition
to
their
lordly
masters
but
though
the
males
when
united
have
in
all
countries
bodily
force
sufficient
to
maintain
this
severe
tyranny
yet
such
are
the
insinuation
address
and
charms
of
their
fair
companions
that
women
are
commonly
able
to
break
the
confederacy
and
share
with
the
other
sex
in
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
society
were
the
human
species
so
framed
by
nature
as
that
each
individual
possessed
within
himself
every
faculty
requisite
both
for
his
own
preservation
and
for
the
propagation
of
his
kind
were
all
society
and
intercourse
cut
off
between
man
and
man
by
the
primary
intention
of
the
supreme
creator
it
seems
evident
that
so
solitary
a
being
would
be
as
much
incapable
of
justice
as
of
social
discourse
and
conversation
where
mutual
regards
and
forbearance
serve
to
no
manner
of
purpose
they
would
never
direct
the
conduct
of
any
reasonable
man
the
headlong
course
of
the
passions
would
be
checked
by
no
reflection
on
future
consequences
and
as
each
man
is
here
supposed
to
love
himself
alone
and
to
depend
only
on
himself
and
his
own
activity
for
safety
and
happiness
he
would
on
every
occasion
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
challenge
the
preference
above
every
other
being
to
none
of
which
he
is
bound
by
any
ties
either
of
nature
or
of
interest
but
suppose
the
conjunction
of
the
sexes
to
be
established
in
nature
a
family
immediately
arises
and
particular
rules
being
found
requisite
for
its
subsistence
these
are
immediately
embraced
though
without
comprehending
the
rest
of
mankind
within
their
prescriptions
suppose
that
several
families
unite
together
into
one
society
which
is
totally
disjoined
from
all
others
the
rules
which
preserve
peace
and
order
enlarge
themselves
to
the
utmost
extent
of
that
society
but
becoming
then
entirely
useless
lose
their
force
when
carried
one
step
farther
but
again
suppose
that
several
distinct
societies
maintain
a
kind
of
intercourse
for
mutual
convenience
and
advantage
the
boundaries
of
justice
still
grow
larger
in
proportion
to
the
largeness
of
views
and
the
force
of
their
mutual
connexions
history
experience
reason
sufficiently
instruct
us
in
this
natural
progress
of
human
sentiments
and
in
the
gradual
enlargement
of
our
regards
to
justice
in
proportion
as
we
become
acquainted
with
the
extensive
utility
of
that
virtue
part
ii
if
we
examine
the
particular
laws
by
which
justice
is
directed
and
property
determined
we
shall
still
be
presented
with
the
same
conclusion
the
good
of
mankind
is
the
only
object
of
all
these
laws
and
regulations
not
only
is
it
requisite
for
the
peace
and
interest
of
society
that
men
possessions
should
be
separated
but
the
rules
which
we
follow
in
making
the
separation
are
such
as
can
best
be
contrived
to
serve
farther
the
interests
of
society
we
shall
suppose
that
a
creature
possessed
of
reason
but
unacquainted
with
human
nature
deliberates
with
himself
what
rules
of
justice
or
property
would
best
promote
public
interest
and
establish
peace
and
security
among
mankind
his
most
obvious
thought
would
be
to
assign
the
largest
possessions
to
the
most
extensive
virtue
and
give
every
one
the
power
of
doing
good
proportioned
to
his
inclination
in
a
perfect
theocracy
where
a
being
infinitely
intelligent
governs
by
particular
volitions
this
rule
would
certainly
have
place
and
might
serve
to
the
wisest
purposes
but
were
mankind
to
execute
such
a
law
so
great
is
the
uncertainty
of
merit
both
from
its
natural
obscurity
and
from
the
of
each
individual
that
no
determinate
rule
of
conduct
would
ever
result
from
it
and
the
total
dissolution
of
society
must
be
the
immediate
consequence
fanatics
may
suppose
that
dominion
is
founded
on
grace
and
that
saints
alone
inherit
the
earth
but
the
civil
magistrate
very
justly
puts
these
sublime
theorists
on
the
same
footing
with
common
robbers
and
teaches
them
by
the
severest
discipline
that
a
rule
which
in
speculation
may
seem
the
most
advantageous
to
society
may
yet
be
found
in
practice
totally
pernicious
and
destructive
that
there
were
religious
fanatics
of
this
kind
in
england
during
the
civil
wars
we
learn
from
history
though
it
is
probable
that
the
obvious
tendency
of
these
principles
excited
such
horror
in
mankind
as
soon
obliged
the
dangerous
enthusiasts
to
renounce
or
at
least
conceal
their
tenets
perhaps
the
levellers
who
claimed
an
equal
distribution
of
property
were
a
kind
of
political
fanatics
which
arose
from
the
religious
species
and
more
openly
avowed
their
pretensions
as
carrying
a
more
plausible
appearance
of
being
practicable
in
themselves
as
well
as
useful
to
human
society
it
must
indeed
be
confessed
that
nature
is
so
liberal
to
mankind
that
were
all
her
presents
equally
divided
among
the
species
and
improved
by
art
and
industry
every
individual
would
enjoy
all
the
necessaries
and
even
most
of
the
comforts
of
life
nor
would
ever
be
liable
to
any
ills
but
such
as
might
accidentally
arise
from
the
sickly
frame
and
constitution
of
his
body
it
must
also
be
confessed
that
wherever
we
depart
from
this
equality
we
rob
the
poor
of
more
satisfaction
than
we
add
to
the
rich
and
that
the
slight
gratification
of
a
frivolous
vanity
in
one
individual
frequently
costs
more
than
bread
to
many
families
and
even
provinces
it
may
appear
withal
that
the
rule
of
equality
as
it
would
be
highly
useful
is
not
altogether
impracticable
but
has
taken
place
at
least
in
an
imperfect
degree
in
some
republics
particularly
that
of
sparta
where
it
was
attended
it
is
said
with
the
most
beneficial
consequences
not
to
mention
that
the
agrarian
laws
so
frequently
claimed
in
rome
and
carried
into
execution
in
many
greek
cities
proceeded
all
of
them
from
a
general
idea
of
the
utility
of
this
principle
but
historians
and
even
common
sense
may
inform
us
that
however
specious
these
ideas
of
perfect
equality
may
seem
they
are
really
at
bottom
impracticable
and
were
they
not
so
would
be
extremely
pernicious
to
human
society
render
possessions
ever
so
equal
different
degrees
of
art
care
and
industry
will
immediately
break
that
equality
or
if
you
check
these
virtues
you
reduce
society
to
the
most
extreme
indigence
and
instead
of
preventing
want
and
beggary
in
a
few
render
it
unavoidable
to
the
whole
community
the
most
rigorous
inquisition
too
is
requisite
to
watch
every
inequality
on
its
first
appearance
and
the
most
severe
jurisdiction
to
punish
and
redress
it
but
besides
that
so
much
authority
must
soon
degenerate
into
tyranny
and
be
exerted
with
great
partialities
who
can
possibly
be
possessed
of
it
in
such
a
situation
as
is
here
supposed
perfect
equality
of
possessions
destroying
all
subordination
weakens
extremely
the
authority
of
magistracy
and
must
reduce
all
power
nearly
to
a
level
as
well
as
property
we
may
conclude
therefore
that
in
order
to
establish
laws
for
the
regulation
of
property
we
must
be
acquainted
with
the
nature
and
situation
of
man
must
reject
appearances
which
may
be
false
though
specious
and
must
search
for
those
rules
which
are
on
the
whole
most
useful
and
beneficial
vulgar
sense
and
slight
experience
are
sufficient
for
this
purpose
where
men
give
not
way
to
too
selfish
avidity
or
too
extensive
enthusiasm
who
sees
not
for
instance
that
whatever
is
produced
or
improved
by
a
man
art
or
industry
ought
for
ever
to
be
secured
to
him
in
order
to
give
encouragement
to
such
useful
habits
and
accomplishments
that
the
property
ought
also
to
descend
to
children
and
relations
for
the
same
useful
purpose
that
it
may
be
alienated
by
consent
in
order
to
beget
that
commerce
and
intercourse
which
is
so
beneficial
to
human
society
and
that
all
contracts
and
promises
ought
carefully
to
be
fulfilled
in
order
to
secure
mutual
trust
and
confidence
by
which
the
general
interest
of
mankind
is
so
much
promoted
examine
the
writers
on
the
laws
of
nature
and
you
will
always
find
that
whatever
principles
they
set
out
with
they
are
sure
to
terminate
here
at
last
and
to
assign
as
the
ultimate
reason
for
every
rule
which
they
establish
the
convenience
and
necessities
of
mankind
a
concession
thus
extorted
in
opposition
to
systems
has
more
authority
than
if
it
had
been
made
in
prosecution
of
them
what
other
reason
indeed
could
writers
ever
give
why
this
must
be
mine
and
that
yours
since
uninstructed
nature
surely
never
made
any
such
distinction
the
objects
which
receive
those
appellations
are
of
themselves
foreign
to
us
they
are
totally
disjoined
and
separated
from
us
and
nothing
but
the
general
interests
of
society
can
form
the
connexion
sometimes
the
interests
of
society
may
require
a
rule
of
justice
in
a
particular
case
but
may
not
determine
any
particular
rule
among
several
which
are
all
equally
beneficial
in
that
case
the
slightest
analogies
are
laid
hold
of
in
order
to
prevent
that
indifference
and
ambiguity
which
would
be
the
source
of
perpetual
dissension
thus
possession
alone
and
first
possession
is
supposed
to
convey
property
where
no
body
else
has
any
preceding
claim
and
pretension
many
of
the
reasonings
of
lawyers
are
of
this
analogical
nature
and
depend
on
very
slight
connexions
of
the
imagination
does
any
one
scruple
in
extraordinary
cases
to
violate
all
regard
to
the
private
property
of
individuals
and
sacrifice
to
public
interest
a
distinction
which
had
been
established
for
the
sake
of
that
interest
the
safety
of
the
people
is
the
supreme
law
all
other
particular
laws
are
subordinate
to
it
and
dependent
on
it
and
if
in
the
common
course
of
things
they
be
followed
and
regarded
it
is
only
because
the
public
safety
and
interest
commonly
demand
so
equal
and
impartial
an
administration
sometimes
both
utility
and
analogy
fail
and
leave
the
laws
of
justice
in
total
uncertainty
thus
it
is
highly
requisite
that
prescription
or
long
possession
should
convey
property
but
what
number
of
days
or
months
or
years
should
be
sufficient
for
that
purpose
it
is
impossible
for
reason
alone
to
determine
civil
laws
here
supply
the
place
of
the
natural
code
and
assign
different
terms
for
prescription
according
to
the
different
utilities
proposed
by
the
legislator
bills
of
exchange
and
promissory
notes
by
the
laws
of
most
countries
prescribe
sooner
than
bonds
and
mortgages
and
contracts
of
a
more
formal
nature
in
general
we
may
observe
that
all
questions
of
property
are
subordinate
to
the
authority
of
civil
laws
which
extend
restrain
modify
and
alter
the
rules
of
natural
justice
according
to
the
particular
convenience
of
each
community
the
laws
have
or
ought
to
have
a
constant
reference
to
the
constitution
of
government
the
manners
the
climate
the
religion
the
commerce
the
situation
of
each
society
a
late
author
of
genius
as
well
as
learning
has
prosecuted
this
subject
at
large
and
has
established
from
these
principles
a
system
of
political
knowledge
which
abounds
in
ingenious
and
brilliant
thoughts
and
is
not
wanting
in
solidity
footnote
the
author
of
des
loix
this
illustrious
writer
however
sets
out
with
a
different
theory
and
supposes
all
right
to
be
founded
on
certain
rapports
or
relations
which
is
a
system
that
in
my
opinion
never
will
be
reconciled
with
true
philosophy
father
malebranche
as
far
as
i
can
learn
was
the
first
that
started
this
abstract
theory
of
morals
which
was
afterwards
adopted
by
cudworth
clarke
and
others
and
as
it
excludes
all
sentiment
and
pretends
to
found
everything
on
reason
it
has
not
wanted
followers
in
this
philosophic
age
see
section
i
appendix
i
with
regard
to
justice
the
virtue
here
treated
of
the
inference
against
this
theory
seems
short
and
conclusive
property
is
allowed
to
be
dependent
on
civil
laws
civil
laws
are
allowed
to
have
no
other
object
but
the
interest
of
society
this
therefore
must
be
allowed
to
be
the
sole
foundation
of
property
and
justice
not
to
mention
that
our
obligation
itself
to
obey
the
magistrate
and
his
laws
is
founded
on
nothing
but
the
interests
of
society
if
the
ideas
of
justice
sometimes
do
not
follow
the
dispositions
of
civil
law
we
shall
find
that
these
cases
instead
of
objections
are
confirmations
of
the
theory
delivered
above
where
a
civil
law
is
so
perverse
as
to
cross
all
the
interests
of
society
it
loses
all
its
authority
and
men
judge
by
the
ideas
of
natural
justice
which
are
conformable
to
those
interests
sometimes
also
civil
laws
for
useful
purposes
require
a
ceremony
or
form
to
any
deed
and
where
that
is
wanting
their
decrees
run
contrary
to
the
usual
tenour
of
justice
but
one
who
takes
advantage
of
such
chicanes
is
not
commonly
regarded
as
an
honest
man
thus
the
interests
of
society
require
that
contracts
be
fulfilled
and
there
is
not
a
more
material
article
either
of
natural
or
civil
justice
but
the
omission
of
a
trifling
circumstance
will
often
by
law
invalidate
a
contract
in
foro
humano
but
not
in
foro
conscientiae
as
divines
express
themselves
in
these
cases
the
magistrate
is
supposed
only
to
withdraw
his
power
of
enforcing
the
right
not
to
have
altered
the
right
where
his
intention
extends
to
the
right
and
is
conformable
to
the
interests
of
society
it
never
fails
to
alter
the
right
a
clear
proof
of
the
origin
of
justice
and
of
property
as
assigned
above
what
is
a
man
property
anything
which
it
is
lawful
for
him
and
for
him
alone
to
use
but
what
rule
have
we
by
which
we
can
distinguish
these
objects
here
we
must
have
recourse
to
statutes
customs
precedents
analogies
and
a
hundred
other
circumstances
some
of
which
are
constant
and
inflexible
some
variable
and
arbitrary
but
the
ultimate
point
in
which
they
all
professedly
terminate
is
the
interest
and
happiness
of
human
society
where
this
enters
not
into
consideration
nothing
can
appear
more
whimsical
unnatural
and
even
superstitious
than
all
or
most
of
the
laws
of
justice
and
of
property
those
who
ridicule
vulgar
superstitions
and
expose
the
folly
of
particular
regards
to
meats
days
places
postures
apparel
have
an
easy
task
while
they
consider
all
the
qualities
and
relations
of
the
objects
and
discover
no
adequate
cause
for
that
affection
or
antipathy
veneration
or
horror
which
have
so
mighty
an
influence
over
a
considerable
part
of
mankind
a
syrian
would
have
starved
rather
than
taste

an

if

be
examined
by
the

of
sight
smell
or
taste
or
scrutinized
by
the
sciences
of
chemistry
medicine
or
physics
no
difference
is
ever
found
between
them
and
any
other
species
nor
can
that
precise
circumstance
be
pitched
on
which
may
afford
a
just
foundation
for
the
religious
passion
a

abominable

is
a
damnable
sin
this
earth
or
building
yesterday
was
profane
by
the
muttering
of
certain
words
it
has
become
holy
and
sacred
such
reflections
as
these
in
the
mouth
of
a
philosopher
one
may
safely
say
are
too
obvious
to
have
any
influence
because
they
must
always
to
every
man
occur
at
first
sight
and
where
they
prevail
not
of
themselves
they
are
surely
obstructed
by
education
prejudice
and
passion
not
by
ignorance
or
mistake
it
may
appear
to
a
careless
view
or
rather
a
too
abstracted
reflection
that
there
enters
a
like
superstition
into
all
the
sentiments
of
justice
and
that
if
a
man
expose
its
object
or
what
we
call
property
to
the
same
scrutiny
of
sense
and
science
he
will
not
by
the
most
accurate
enquiry
find
any
foundation
for
the
difference
made
by
moral
sentiment
i
may
lawfully
nourish
myself
from
this
tree
but
the
fruit
of
another
of
the
same
species
ten
paces
off
it
is
criminal
for
me
to
touch
had
i
worn
this
apparel
an
hour
ago
i
had
merited
the
severest
punishment
but
a
man
by
pronouncing
a
few
magical
syllables
has
now
rendered
it
fit
for
my
use
and
service
were
this
house
placed
in
the
neighbouring
territory
it
had
been
immoral
for
me
to
dwell
in
it
but
being
built
on
this
side
the
river
it
is
subject
to
a
different
municipal
law
and
by
its
becoming
mine
i
incur
no
blame
or
censure
the
same
species
of
reasoning
it
may
be
thought
which
so
successfully
exposes
superstition
is
also
applicable
to
justice
nor
is
it
possible
in
the
one
case
more
than
in
the
other
to
point
out
in
the
object
that
precise
quality
or
circumstance
which
is
the
foundation
of
the
sentiment
but
there
is
this
material
difference
between
superstition
and
justice
that
the
former
is
frivolous
useless
and
burdensome
the
latter
is
absolutely
requisite
to
the
of
mankind
and
existence
of
society
when
we
abstract
from
this
circumstance
for
it
is
too
apparent
ever
to
be
overlooked
it
must
be
confessed
that
all
regards
to
right
and
property
seem
entirely
without
foundation
as
much
as
the
grossest
and
most
vulgar
superstition
were
the
interests
of
society
nowise
concerned
it
is
as
unintelligible
why
another
articulating
certain
sounds
implying
consent
should
change
the
nature
of
my
actions
with
regard
to
a
particular
object
as
why
the
reciting
of
a
liturgy
by
a
priest
in
a
certain
habit
and
posture
should
dedicate
a
heap
of
brick
and
timber
and
render
it
thenceforth
and
for
ever
sacred
footnote
it
is
evident
that
the
will
or
consent
alone
never
transfers
property
nor
causes
the
obligation
of
a
promise
for
the
same
reasoning
extends
to
both
but
the
will
must
be
expressed
by
words
or
signs
in
order
to
impose
a
tie
upon
any
man
the
expression
being
once
brought
in
as
subservient
to
the
will
soon
becomes
the
principal
part
of
the
promise
nor
will
a
man
be
less
bound
by
his
word
though
he
secretly
give
a
different
direction
to
his
intention
and
withhold
the
assent
of
his
mind
but
though
the
expression
makes
on
most
occasions
the
whole
of
the
promise
yet
it
does
not
always
so
and
one
who
should
make
use
of
any
expression
of
which
he
knows
not
the
meaning
and
which
he
uses
without
any
sense
of
the
consequences
would
not
certainly
be
bound
by
it
nay
though
he
know
its
meaning
yet
if
he
use
it
in
jest
only
and
with
such
signs
as
evidently
show
that
he
has
no
serious
intention
of
binding
himself
he
would
not
lie
under
any
obligation
of
performance
but
it
is
necessary
that
the
words
be
a
perfect
expression
of
the
will
without
any
contrary
signs
nay
even
this
we
must
not
carry
so
far
as
to
imagine
that
one
whom
by
our
quickness
of
understanding
we
conjecture
from
certain
signs
to
have
an
intention
of
deceiving
us
is
not
bound
by
his
expression
or
verbal
promise
if
we
accept
of
it
but
must
limit
this
conclusion
to
those
cases
where
the
signs
are
of
a
different
nature
from
those
of
deceit
all
these
contradictions
are
easily
accounted
for
if
justice
arise
entirely
from
its
usefulness
to
society
but
will
never
be
explained
on
any
other
hypothesis
it
is
remarkable
that
the
moral
decisions
of
the
jesuits
and
other
relaxed
casuists
were
commonly
formed
in
prosecution
of
some
such
subtilties
of
reasoning
as
are
here
pointed
out
and
proceed
as
much
from
the
habit
of
scholastic
refinement
as
from
any
corruption
of
the
heart
if
we
may
follow
the
authority
of
mons
bayle
see
his
dictionary
article
loyola
and
why
has
the
indignation
of
mankind
risen
so
high
against
these
casuists
but
because
every
one
perceived
that
human
society
could
not
subsist
were
such
practices
authorized
and
that
morals
must
always
be
handled
with
a
view
to
public
interest
more
than
philosophical
regularity
if
the
secret
direction
of
the
intention
said
every
man
of
sense
could
invalidate
a
contract
where
is
our
security
and
yet
a
metaphysical
schoolman
might
think
that
where
an
intention
was
supposed
to
be
requisite
if
that
intention
really
had
not
place
no
consequence
ought
to
follow
and
no
obligation
be
imposed
the
casuistical
subtilties
may
not
be
greater
than
the
snbtilties
of
lawyers
hinted
at
above
but
as
the
former
are
pernicious
and
the
latter
innocent
and
even
necessary
this
is
the
reason
of
the
very
different
reception
they
meet
with
from
the
world
it
is
a
doctrine
of
the
church
of
rome
that
the
priest
by
a
secret
direction
of
his
intention
can
invalidate
any
sacrament
this
position
is
derived
from
a
strict
and
regular
prosecution
of
the
obvious
truth
that
empty
words
alone
without
any
meaning
or
intention
in
the
speaker
can
never
be
attended
with
any
effect
if
the
same
conclusion
be
not
admitted
in
reasonings
concerning
civil
contracts
where
the
affair
is
allowed
to
be
of
so
much
less
consequence
than
the
eternal
salvation
of
thousands
it
proceeds
entirely
from
men
sense
of
the
danger
and
inconvenience
of
the
doctrine
in
the
former
case
and
we
may
thence
observe
that
however
positive
arrogant
and
dogmatical
any
superstition
may
appear
it
never
can
convey
any
thorough
persuasion
of
the
reality
of
its
objects
or
put
them
in
any
degree
on
a
balance
with
the
common
incidents
of
life
which
we
learn
from
daily
observation
and
experimental
reasoning
these
reflections
are
far
from
weakening
the
obligations
of
justice
or
diminishing
anything
from
the
most
sacred
attention
to
property
on
the
contrary
such
sentiments
must
acquire
new
force
from
the
present
reasoning
for
what
stronger
foundation
can
be
desired
or
conceived
for
any
duty
than
to
observe
that
human
society
or
even
human
nature
could
not
subsist
without
the
establishment
of
it
and
will
still
arrive
at
greater
degrees
of
happiness
and
perfection
the
more
inviolable
the
regard
is
which
is
paid
to
that
duty
the
dilemma
seems
obvious
as
justice
evidently
tends
to
promote
public
utility
and
to
support
civil
society
the
sentiment
of
justice
is
either
derived
from
our
reflecting
on
that
tendency
or
like
hunger
thirst
and
other
appetites
resentment
love
of
life
attachment
to
offspring
and
other
passions
arises
from
a
simple
original
instinct
in
the
human
breast
which
nature
has
implanted
for
like
salutary
purposes
if
the
latter
be
the
case
it
follows
that
property
which
is
the
object
of
justice
is
also
distinguished
by
a
simple
original
instinct
and
is
not
ascertained
by
any
argument
or
reflection
but
who
is
there
that
ever
heard
of
such
an
instinct
or
is
this
a
subject
in
which
new
discoveries
can
be
made
we
may
as
well
expect
to
discover
in
the
body
new
senses
which
had
before
escaped
the
observation
of
all
mankind
but
farther
though
it
seems
a
very
simple
proposition
to
say
that
nature
by
an
instinctive
sentiment
distinguishes
property
yet
in
reality
we
shall
find
that
there
are
required
for
that
purpose
ten
thousand
different
instincts
and
these
employed
about
objects
of
the
greatest
intricacy
and
nicest
discernment
for
when
a
definition
of
property
is
required
that
relation
is
found
to
resolve
itself
into
any
possession
acquired
by
occupation
by
industry
by
prescription
by
inheritance
by
contract
can
we
think
that
nature
by
an
original
instinct
instructs
us
in
all
these
methods
of
acquisition
these
words
too
inheritance
and
contract
stand
for
ideas
infinitely
complicated
and
to
define
them
exactly
a
hundred
volumes
of
laws
and
a
thousand
volumes
of
commentators
have
not
been
found
sufficient
does
nature
whose
instincts
in
men
are
all
simple
embrace
such
complicated
and
artificial
objects
and
create
a
rational
creature
without
trusting
anything
to
the
operation
of
his
reason
but
even
though
all
this
were
admitted
it
would
not
be
satisfactory
positive
laws
can
certainly
transfer
property

their
houses

here
we
perceive
the
influence
of
reason
and
custom
a
like
inference
may
be
drawn
from
comparing
the
instinct
of
generation
and
the
institution
of
property
how
great
soever
the
variety
of
municipal
laws
it
must
be
confessed
that
their
chief
outlines
pretty
regularly
concur
because
the
purposes
to
which
they
tend
are
everywhere
exactly
similar
in
like
manner
all
houses
have
a
roof
and
walls
windows
and
chimneys
though
diversified
in
their
shape
figure
and
materials
the
purposes
of
the
latter
directed
to
the
conveniencies
of
human
life
discover
not
more
plainly
their
origin
from
reason
and
reflection
than
do
those
of
the
former
which
point
all
to
a
like
end
i
need
not
mention
the
variations
which
all
the
rules
of
property
receive
from
the
finer
turns
and
connexions
of
the
imagination
and
from
the
subtilties
and
abstractions
of
and
reasonings
there
is
no
possibility
of
reconciling
this
observation
to
the
notion
of
original
instincts
what
alone
will
beget
a
doubt
concerning
the
theory
on
which
i
insist
is
the
influence
of
education
and
acquired
habits
by
which
we
are
so
accustomed
to
blame
injustice
that
we
are
not
in
every
instance
conscious
of
any
immediate
reflection
on
the
pernicious
consequences
of
it
the
views
the
most
familiar
to
us
are
apt
for
that
very
reason
to
escape
us
and
what
we
have
very
frequently
performed
from
certain
motives
we
are
apt
likewise
to
continue
mechanically
without
recalling
on
every
occasion
the
reflections
which
first
determined
us
the
convenience
or
rather
necessity
which
leads
to
justice
is
so
universal
and
everywhere
points
so
much
to
the
same
rules
that
the
habit
takes
place
in
all
societies
and
it
is
not
without
some
scrutiny
that
we
are
able
to
ascertain
its
true
origin
the
matter
however
is
not
so
obscure
but
that
even
in
common
life
we
have
every
moment
recourse
to
the
principle
of
public
utility
and
ask
what
must
become
of
the
world
if
such
practices
prevail
how
could
society
subsist
under
such
disorders
were
the
distinction
or
separation
of
possessions
entirely
useless
can
any
one
conceive
that
it
ever
should
have
obtained
in
society
thus
we
seem
upon
the
whole
to
have
attained
a
knowledge
of
the
force
of
that
principle
here
insisted
on
and
can
determine
what
degree
of
esteem
or
moral
approbation
may
result
from
reflections
on
public
interest
and
utility
the
necessity
of
justice
to
the
support
of
society
is
the
sole
foundation
of
that
virtue
and
since
no
moral
excellence
is
more
highly
esteemed
we
may
conclude
that
this
circumstance
of
usefulness
has
in
general
the
strongest
energy
and
most
entire
command
over
our
sentiments
it
must
therefore
be
the
source
of
a
considerable
part
of
the
merit
ascribed
to
humanity
benevolence
friendship
public
spirit
and
other
social
virtues
of
that
stamp
as
it
is
the
sole
source
of
the
moral
approbation
paid
to
fidelity
justice
veracity
integrity
and
those
other
estimable
and
useful
qualities

it
is
entirely
agreeable

occurs
to
us
to
which
we
may
add
in
the
present
case
of
chastity
that
the
example
of
the
old
would
be
pernicious
to
the
young
and
that
women
continually
foreseeing
that
a
certain
time
would
bring
them
the
liberty
of
indulgence
would
naturally
advance
that
period
and
think
more
lightly
of
this
whole
duty
so
requisite
to
society

who
live
in

such
frequent
opportunities

being
pernicious
in

superior
degree
has
also
a
superior
turpitude

moral
deformity
annexed
to
it

is
the
reason

by

required

game
and
these
laws
are
different
in

game
the
foundation
i
own
of
such
societies
is
frivolous
and
the
laws
are
in
a
great
measure

not
altogether
capricious

arbitrary

far
is
there
a
material
difference
between

absolutely
requisite

the
subsistence

the
public
conveniency

regulates

is
inviolably
established
in
the
nature
of
man
and
of
the
world
in
which
he
lives
the
comparison
therefore
in
these
respects
is
very
imperfect
we
may
only
learn
from
it
the
necessity
of
rules
wherever
men
have
any
intercourse
with
each
other

can
not
even
pass
each
other
on
the
road
without

waggoners
coachmen
and
postilions
have
principles
by
which
they
give
the
way
and
these
are
chiefly
founded
on
mutual
ease
and
convenience
sometimes
also
they
are
arbitrary
at
least
dependent
on
a
kind
of
capricious

contradiction
to
all
the

then

are
hurtful
to
society
and
dangerous
or
pernicious
to
every

who
has
an

we
ought
not
to

excited
by

are
in
the
two
cases
very
different
and

is
mixed
with
affection
esteem
approbation

not
the

in

manner
an

may
have
good

and

as
well
as

figure
but
can
we
ever
be
in
love
with
the
former
there
are
a
numerous
set
of
passions
and
sentiments
of
which
thinking
rational
beings
are
by
the
original
constitution
of
nature
the
only
proper
objects
and
though
the
very
same
qualities
be
transferred
to
an
insensible
inanimate
being
they
will
not
excite
the
same
sentiments
the
beneficial
qualities
of
herbs
and
minerals
are
indeed
sometimes
called
their
virtues
but
this
is
an
effect
of
the
caprice
of
language
which
out
not
to
be
regarded
in
reasoning
for
though
there
be
a
species
of
approbation
attending
even
inanimate
objects
when
beneficial
yet
this
sentiment
is
so
weak
and
so
different
from
that
which
is
directed
to
beneficent
magistrates
or
statesman
that
they
ought
not
to
be
ranked
under
the
same
class
or
appellation
a
very
small
variation
of
the
object
even
where
the
same
qualities
are
preserved
will
destroy
a
sentiment
thus
the
same
beauty
transferred
to
a
different
sex
excites
no
amorous
passion
where
nature
is
not
extremely
perverted
but
perhaps
the
difficulty
of
accounting
for
these
effects
of
usefulness
or
its
contrary
has
kept
philosophers
from
admitting
them
into
their
systems
of
ethics
and
has
induced
them
rather
to
employ
any
other
principle
in
explaining
the
origin
of
moral
good
and
evil
but
it
is
no
just
reason
for
rejecting
any
principle
confirmed
by
experience
that
we
can
not
give
a
satisfactory
account
of
its
origin
nor
are
able
to
resolve
it
into
other
more
general
principles
and
if
we
would
employ
a
little
thought
on
the
present
subject
we
need
be
at
no
loss
to
account
for
the
influence
of
utility
and
to
deduce
it
from
principles
the
most
known
and
avowed
in
human
nature
from
the
apparent
usefulness
of
the
social
virtues
it
has
readily
been
inferred
by
sceptics
both
ancient
and
modern
that
all
moral
distinctions
arise
from
education
and
were
at
first
invented
and
afterwards
encouraged
by
the
art
of
politicians
in
order
to
render
men
tractable
and
subdue
their
natural
ferocity
and
selfishness
which
incapacitated
them
for
society
this
principle
indeed
of
precept
and
education
must
so
far
be
owned
to
have
a
powerful
influence
that
it
may
frequently
increase
or
diminish
beyond
their
natural
standard
the
sentiments
of
approbation
or
dislike
and
may
even
in
particular
instances
create
without
any
natural
principle
a
new
sentiment
of
this
kind
as
is
evident
in
all
superstitious
practices
and
observances
but
that
all
moral
affection
or
dislike
arises
from
this
origin
will
never
surely
be
allowed
by
any
judicious
enquirer
had
nature
made
no
such
distinction
founded
on
the
original
constitution
of
the
mind
the
words
honourable
and
shameful
lovely
and
odious
noble
and
despicable
had
never
had
place
in
any
language
nor
could
politicians
had
they
invented
these
terms
ever
have
been
able
to
render
them
intelligible
or
make
them
convey
any
idea
to
the
audience
so
that
nothing
can
be
more
superficial
than
this
paradox
of
the
sceptics
and
it
were
well
if
in
the
abstruser
studies
of
logic
and
metaphysics
we
could
as
easily
obviate
the
cavils
of
that
sect
as
in
the
practical
and
more
intelligible
sciences
of
politics
and
morals
the
social
virtues
must
therefore
be
allowed
to
have
a
natural
beauty
and
amiableness
which
at
first
antecedent
to
all
precept
or
education
recommends
them
to
the
esteem
of
uninstructed
mankind
and
engages
their
affections
and
as
the
public
utility
of
these
virtues
is
the
chief
circumstance
whence
they
derive
their
merit
it
follows
that
the
end
which
they
have
a
tendency
to
promote
must
be
some
way
agreeable
to
us
and
take
hold
of
some
natural
affection
it
must
please
either
from
considerations
of
or
from
more
generous
motives
and
regards
it
has
often
been
asserted
that
as
every
man
has
a
strong
connexion
with
society
and
perceives
the
impossibility
of
his
solitary
subsistence
he
becomes
on
that
account
favourable
to
all
those
habits
or
principles
which
promote
order
in
society
and
insure
to
him
the
quiet
possession
of
so
inestimable
a
blessing
as
much
as
we
value
our
own
happiness
and
welfare
as
much
must
we
applaud
the
practice
of
justice
and
humanity
by
which
alone
the
social
confederacy
can
be
maintained
and
every
man
reap
the
fruits
of
mutual
protection
and
assistance
this
deduction
of
morals
from
or
a
regard
to
private
interest
is
an
obvious
thought
and
has
not
arisen
wholly
from
the
wanton
sallies
and
sportive
assaults
of
the
sceptics
to
mention
no
others
polybius
one
of
the
gravest
and
most
judicious

well

of

sentiments

private
advantage
concurs
with
general
affection
for

we
readily
perceive

avow
the
mixture
of
these
distinct
sentiments
which
have
a
very
different
feeling
and
influence
on
the

praise

with

contributes
to

but
the
topics
of
praise
which
we
insist
on
are
very
wide
of
this
circumstance
and
we
may
attempt
to
bring
over
others
to
our
sentiments

that

though

and
we
also
give
it
the
just
tribute
of
praise
and
approbation
nor
do
we
retract
these
sentiments
when
we
hear
that
the
action
passed
at
athens
about
two
thousand
years
ago
and
that
the
persons

were
eschines
and
demosthenes
what
is
that
to
me
there
are
few
occasions
when
this
question
is
not
pertinent
and
had
it
that
universal
infallible
influence
supposed
it
would
turn
into
ridicule
every
composition
and
almost
every
conversation
which
contain
any
praise
or
censure
of
men
and
manners
it
is
but
a
weak
subterfuge
when
pressed
by
these
facts
and
arguments
to
say
that
we
transport
ourselves
by
the
force
of
imagination
into
distant
ages
and
countries
and
consider
the
advantage
which
we
should
have
reaped
from
these
characters
had
we
been
contemporaries
and
had
any
commerce
with
the
persons
it
is
not
conceivable
how
a
real
sentiment
or
passion
can
ever
arise
from
a
known
imaginary
interest
especially
when
our
real
interest
is
still
kept
in
view
and
is
often
acknowledged
to
be
entirely
distinct
from
the
imaginary
and
even
sometimes
opposite
to
it
a
man
brought
to
the
brink
of
a
precipice
can
not
look
down
without
trembling
and
the
sentiment
of
imaginary
danger
actuates
him
in
opposition
to
the
opinion
and
belief
of
real
safety
but
the
imagination
is
here
assisted
by
the
presence
of
a
striking
object
and
yet
prevails
not
except
it
be
also
aided
by
novelty
and
the
unusual
appearance
of
the
object
custom
soon
reconciles
us
to
heights
and
precipices
and
wears
off
these
false
and
delusive
terrors
the
reverse
is
observable
in
the
estimates
which
we
form
of
characters
and
manners
and
the
more
we
habituate
ourselves
to
an
accurate
scrutiny
of
morals
the
more
delicate
feeling
do
we
acquire
of
the
most
minute
distinctions
between
vice
and
virtue
such
frequent
occasion
indeed
have
we
in
common
life
to
pronounce
all
kinds
of
moral
determinations
that
no
object
of
this
kind
can
be
new
or
unusual
to
us
nor
could
any
false
views
or
prepossessions
maintain
their
ground
against
an
experience
so
common
and
familiar
experience
being
chiefly
what
forms
the
associations
of
ideas
it
is
impossible
that
any
association
could
establish
and
support
itself
in
direct
opposition
to
that
principle
usefulness
is
agreeable
and
engages
our
approbation
this
is
a
matter
of
fact
confirmed
by
daily
observation
but
useful
for
what
for
somebody
interest
surely
whose
interest
then
not
our
own
only
for
our
approbation
frequently
extends
farther
it
must
therefore
be
the
interest
of
those
who
are
served
by
the
character
or
action
approved
of
and
these
we
may
conclude
however
remote
are
not
totally
indifferent
to
us
by
opening
up
this
principle
we
shall
discover
one
great
source
of
moral
distinctions
part
ii
is
a
principle
in
human
nature
of
such
extensive
energy
and
the
interest
of
each
individual
is
in
general
so
closely
connected
with
that
of
the
community
that
those
philosophers
were
excusable
who
fancied
that
all
our
concern
for
the
public
might
be
resolved
into
a
concern
for
our
own
happiness
and
preservation
they
saw
every
moment
instances
of
approbation
or
blame
satisfaction
or
displeasure
towards
characters
and
actions
they
denominated
the
objects
of
these
sentiments
virtues
or
vices
they
observed
that
the
former
had
a
tendency
to
increase
the
happiness
and
the
latter
the
misery
of
mankind
they
asked
whether
it
were
possible
that
we
could
have
any
general
concern
for
society
or
any
disinterested
resentment
of
the
welfare
or
injury
of
others
they
found
it
simpler
to
consider
all
these
sentiments
as
modifications
of
and
they
discovered
a
pretence
at
least
for
this
unity
of
principle
in
that
close
union
of
interest
which
is
so
observable
between
the
public
and
each
individual
but
notwithstanding
this
frequent
confusion
of
interests
it
is
easy
to
attain
what
natural
philosophers
after
lord
bacon
have
affected
to
call
the
experimentum
crucis
or
that
experiment
which
points
out
the
right
way
in
any
doubt
or
ambiguity
we
have
found
instances
in
which
private
interest
was
separate
from
public
in
which
it
was
even
contrary
and
yet
we
observed
the
moral
sentiment
to
continue
notwithstanding
this
disjunction
of
interests
and
wherever
these
distinct
interests
sensibly
concurred
we
always
found
a
sensible
increase
of
the
sentiment
and
a
more
warm
affection
to
virtue
and
detestation
of
vice
or
what
we
properly
call
gratitude
and
revenge
compelled
by
these
instances
we
must
renounce
the
theory
which
accounts
for
every
moral
sentiment
by
the
principle
of
we
must
adopt
a
more
public
affection
and
allow
that
the
interests
of
society
are
not
even
on
their
own
account
entirely
indifferent
to
us
usefulness
is
only
a
tendency
to
a
certain
end
and
it
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
that
anything
pleases
as
means
to
an
end
where
the
end
itself
no
wise
affects
us
if
usefulness
therefore
be
a
source
of
moral
sentiment
and
if
this
usefulness
be
not
always
considered
with
a
reference
to
self
it
follows
that
everything
which
contributes
to
the
happiness
of
society
recommends
itself
directly
to
our
approbation
and
here
is
a
principle
which
accounts
in
great
part
for
the
origin
of
morality
and
what
need
we
seek
for
abstruse
and
remote
systems
when
there
occurs
one
so
obvious
and
natural
footnote
it
is
needless
to
push
our
researches
so
far
as
to
ask
why
we
have
humanity
or
a
with
others
it
is
sufficient
that
this
is
experienced
to
be
a
principle
in
human
nature
we
must
stop
somewhere
in
our
examination
of
causes
and
there
are
in
every
science
some
general
principles
beyond
which
we
can
not
hope
to
find
any
principle
more
general
no
man
is
absolutely
indifferent
to
the
happiness
and
misery
of
others
the
first
has
a
natural
tendency
to
give
pleasure
the
second
pain
this
every
one
may
find
in
himself
it
is
not
probable
that
these
principles
can
be
resolved
into
principles
more
simple
and
universal
whatever
attempts
may
have
been
made
to
that
purpose
but
if
it
were
possible
it
belongs
not
to
the
present
subject
and
we
may
here
safely
consider
these
principles
as
original
happy
if
we
can
render
all
the
consequences
sufficiently
plain
and
perspicuous
have
we
any
difficulty
to
comprehend
the
force
of
humanity
and
benevolence
or
to
conceive
that
the
very
aspect
of
happiness
joy
prosperity
gives
pleasure

kind

are
not

arbitrary
affect
us
with
melancholy
but
the
natural
symptoms
tears
and
cries
and
groans
never
fail
to
infuse
compassion
and
uneasiness
and
if
the
effects
of
misery
touch
us
in
so
lively
a
manner
can
we
be
supposed
altogether
insensible
or
indifferent
towards
its
causes

a
malicious
or

character
and

must
embellish

forbear

with
pleasure

pleasures

arise
in
me
against
such
violence
and
injury
but
it
is
no
wonder
he
adds
that
a
private
wrong
should
proceed
from
a
man
who
had
enslaved
provinces
depopulated
cities
and
made
the
field
and

stream
with
human
blood
i
am
struck
with
horror
at
the
prospect
of
so
much
misery
and
am
actuated
by
the
strongest
antipathy
against
its
author
in
general
it
is
certain
that
wherever
we
go
whatever
we
reflect
on
or
converse
about
everything
still
presents
us
with
the
view
of
human
happiness
or
misery
and
excites
in
our
breast
a
sympathetic
movement
of
pleasure
or
uneasiness
in
our
serious
occupations
in
our
careless
amusements
this
principle
still
exerts
its
active
energy
a
man
who
enters
the
theatre
is
immediately
struck
with
the
view
of
so
great
a
multitude
participating
of
one
common
amusement
and
experiences
from
their
very
aspect
a
superior
sensibility
or
disposition
of
being

with
every
sentiment
which
he
shares
with

observes
the
actors
to
be
animated
by
the
appearance
of
a
full
audience
and
raised
to
a
degree
of
enthusiasm
which
they
can
not
command
in
any
solitary
or
calm
moment
every
movement
of
the
theatre
by
a
skilful
poet
is
communicated
as
it
were
by
magic
to
the
spectators
who
weep
tremble
resent
rejoice
and
are
inflamed
with
all
the
variety
of
passions
which
actuate
the
several
personages
of
the
drama
where
any
event
crosses
our
wishes
and
interrupts
the
happiness
of
the
favourite
characters
we
feel
a
sensible
anxiety
and
concern
but
where
their
sufferings
proceed
from
the
treachery
cruelty
or
tyranny
of
an
enemy
our
breasts
are
affected
with
the
liveliest
resentment
against
the
author
of
these
calamities
it
is
here
esteemed
contrary
to
the
rules
of
art
to
represent
anything
cool
and
indifferent
a
distant
friend
or
a
confident
who
has
no
immediate
interest
in
the
catastrophe
ought
if
possible
to
be
avoided
by
the
poet
as
communicating
a
like
indifference
to
the
audience
and
checking
the
progress
of
the
passions
few
species
of
poetry
are
more
entertaining
than
pastoral
and
every
one
is
sensible
that
the
chief
source
of
its
pleasure
arises
from
those
images
of
a
gentle
and
tender
tranquillity
which
it
represents
in
its
personages
and
of
which
it
communicates
a
like
sentiment
to
the
reader
sannazarius
who
transferred
the
scene
to
the
though
he
presented
the
most
magnificent

in

is
confessed
to
have
erred
in
his
choice
the
idea
of
toil
labour
and
danger
suffered
by
the

is
painful
by
an
unavoidable

resemble

every

no
passion

be

us

there

which
every

lively
imagery

make
it
look

a

proof

wherever
that
reality
is

piece
of

by
which
the
fate
of

on
this
occasion
to
be
in
some
degree
the
interest
of
each
individual
the
imagination
is
sure
to
be
affected
though
the
passions
excited
may
not
always
be
so
strong
and
steady
as
to
have
great
influence
on
the
conduct
and
behaviour
the
perusal
of
a
history
seems
a
calm
entertainment
but
would
be
no

at
all

not

hearts
beat
with

which
are

with

our

the

describes
the
trivial
encounters
of

harmless
wars
of

equally
with

convince
us
of
the
cruel
depravity
of
nero

tiberius
but
what
a

the

coldly
relates
the
facts
and
the
latter
sets
before
our

the

soranus
and
a
thrasea
intrepid
in
their
fate
and
only
moved
by
the
melting
sorrows

their

what

then
touches
every
human

what
indignation
against
the
tyrant

causeless
fear
or
unprovoked
malice
gave
rise
to
such
detestable
barbarity
if
we
bring
these
subjects
nearer
if
we
remove
all
suspicion
of
fiction

this
social
sympathy
in
human
nature
the
frivolousness
of
the
subject
too
we
may
observe
is
not
able
to
detach
us
entirely
from
what
carries
an
image
of
human
sentiment
and
affection
when
a
person
stutters
and
pronounces
with
difficulty
we
even
sympathize
with
this
trivial
uneasiness
and
suffer
for

harsh

the
ear
nay
when
we
run
over
a
book
with
our
eye
we
are
sensible
of
such
unharmonious
composition

we
still
imagine
that
a

recites
it

shall
allow
is
much
fainter
than
our
concern
for
ourselves
and
sympathy
with
persons
remote
from
us
much
fainter
than
that
with
persons
near
and
contiguous
but
for
this
very
reason
it
is
necessary
for
us
in
our
calm
judgements
and
discourse
concerning
the
characters
of
men
to
neglect
all
these
differences
and
render
our
sentiments
more
public
and
social
besides
that
we
ourselves
often
change
our
situation
in
this
particular
we
every
day
meet
with
persons
who
are
in
a
situation
different
from
us
and
who
could
never
converse
with
us
were
we
to
remain
constantly
in
that
position
and
point
of
view
which
is
peculiar
to
ourselves
the
intercourse
of
sentiments
therefore
in
society
and
conversation
makes
us
form
some
general
unalterable
standard
by
which
we
may
approve
or
disapprove
of
characters
and
manners
and
though
the
heart
takes
not
part
entirely
with
those
general
notions
nor
regulates
all
its
love
and
hatred
by
the
universal
abstract
differences
of
vice
and
virtue
without
regard
to
self
or
the
persons
with
whom
we
are
more
intimately
connected
yet
have
these
moral
differences
a
considerable
influence
and
being
sufficient
at
least
for
discourse
serve
all
our
purposes
in
company
in
the
pulpit
on
the
theatre
and
in
the
schools
footnote
it
is
wisely
ordained
by
nature
that
private
connexions
should
commonly
prevail
over
univeral
views
and
considerations
otherwise
our
affections
and
actions
would
be
dissopated
and
lost
for
want
of
a
proper
limited
object
thus
a
small
benefit
done
to
ourselves
or
our
near
friends
excites
more
lively
sentiments
of
love
and
approbation
than
a
great
benefit
done
to
a
distant
commonwealth
but
still
we
know
here
as
in
all
the
senses
to
correct
these
inequalities
by
reflection
and
retain
a
general
standard
of
vice
and
virtue
founded
chiefly
on
a
general
usefulness
thus
in
whatever
light
we
take
this
subject
the
merit
ascribed
to
the
social
virtues
appears
still
uniform
and
arises
chiefly
from
that
regard
which
the
natural
sentiment
of
benevolence
engages
us
to
pay
to
the
interests
of
mankind
and
society
if
we
consider
the
principles
of
the
human
make
such
as
they
appear
to
daily
experience
and
observation
we
must
a
priori
conclude
it
impossible
for
such
a
creature
as
man
to
be
totally
indifferent
to
the
well
or
of
his
and
not
readily
of
himself
to
pronounce
where
nothing
gives
him
any
particular
bias
that
what
promotes
their
happiness
is
good
what
tends
to
their
misery
is
evil
without
any
farther
regard
or
consideration
here
then
are
the
faint
rudiments
at
least
or
outlines
of
a
general
distinction
between
actions
and
in
proportion
as
the
humanity
of
the
person
is
supposed
to
increase
his
connexion
with
those
who
are
injured
or
benefited
and
his
lively
conception
of
their
misery
or
happiness
his
consequent
censure
or
approbation
acquires
proportionable
vigour
there
is
no
necessity
that
a
generous
action
barely
mentioned
in
an
old
history
or
remote
gazette
should
communicate
any
strong
feelings
of
applause
and
admiration
virtue
placed
at
such
a
distance
is
like
a
fixed
star
which
though
to
the
eye
of
reason
it
may
appear
as
luminous
as
the
sun
in
his
meridian
is
so
infinitely
removed
as
to
affect
the
senses
neither
with
light
nor
heat
bring
this
virtue
nearer
by
our
acquaintance
or
connexion
with
the
persons
or
even
by
an
eloquent
recital
of
the
case
our
hearts
are
immediately
caught
our
sympathy
enlivened
and
our
cool
approbation
converted
into
the
warmest
sentiments
of
friendship
and
regard
these
seem
necessary
and
infallible
consequences
of
the
general
principles
of
human
nature
as
discovered
in
common
life
and
practice
again
reverse
these
views
and
reasonings
consider
the
matter
a
posteriori
and
weighing
the
consequences
enquire
if
the
merit
of
social
virtue
be
not
in
a
great
measure
derived
from
the
feelings
of
humanity
with
which
it
affects
the
spectators
it
appears
to
be
matter
of
fact
that
the
circumstance
of
utility
in
all
subjects
is
a
source
of
praise
and
approbation
that
it
is
constantly
appealed
to
in
all
moral
decisions
concerning
the
merit
and
demerit
of
actions
that
it
is
the
sole
source
of
that
high
regard
paid
to
justice
fidelity
honour
allegiance
and
chastity
that
it
is
inseparable
from
all
the
other
social
virtues
humanity
generosity
charity
affability
lenity
mercy
and
moderation
and
in
a
word
that
it
is
a
foundation
of
the
chief
part
of
morals
which
has
a
reference
to
mankind
and
our
it
appears
also
that
in
our
general
approbation
of
characters
and
manners
the
useful
tendency
of
the
social
virtues
moves
us
not
by
any
regards
to
but
has
an
influence
much
more
universal
and
extensive
it
appears
that
a
tendency
to
public
good
and
to
the
promoting
of
peace
harmony
and
order
in
society
does
always
by
affecting
the
benevolent
principles
of
our
frame
engage
us
on
the
side
of
the
social
virtues
and
it
appears
as
an
additional
confirmation
that
these
principles
of
humanity
and
sympathy
enter
so
deeply
into
all
our
sentiments
and
have
so
powerful
an
influence
as
may
enable
them
to
excite
the
strongest
censure
and
applause
the
present
theory
is
the
simple
result
of
all
these
inferences
each
of
which
seems
founded
on
uniform
experience
and
observation
were
it
doubtful
whether
there
were
any
such
principle
in
our
nature
as
humanity
or
a
concern
for
others
yet
when
we
see
in
numberless
instances
that
whatever
has
a
tendency
to
promote
the
interests
of
society
is
so
highly
approved
of
we
ought
thence
to
learn
the
force
of
the
benevolent
principle
since
it
is
impossible
for
anything
to
please
as
means
to
an
end
where
the
end
is
totally
indifferent
on
the
other
hand
were
it
doubtful
whether
there
were
implanted
in
our
nature
any
general
principle
of
moral
blame
and
approbation
yet
when
we
see
in
numberless
instances
the
influence
of
humanity
we
ought
thence
to
conclude
that
it
is
impossible
but
that
everything
which
promotes
the
interest
of
society
must
communicate
pleasure
and
what
is
pernicious
give
uneasiness
but
when
these
different
reflections
and
observations
concur
in
establishing
the
same
conclusion
must
they
not
bestow
an
undisputed
evidence
upon
it
it
is
however
hoped
that
the
progress
of
this
argument
will
bring
a
farther
confirmation
of
the
present
theory
by
showing
the
rise
of
other
sentiments
of
esteem
and
regard
from

prejudicial
to
the

the

strikes

the

humanity
footnote
one
may
venture
to
affirm
that
there
is
no
human
nature
to
whom
the
appearance
of
happiness
where
envy
or
revenge
has
no
place
does
not
give
pleasure
that
of
misery
uneasiness
this
seems
inseparable
from
our
make
and
constitution
but
they
are
only
more
generous
minds
that
are
thence
prompted
to
seek
zealously
the
good
of
others
and
to
have
a
real
passion
for
their
welfare
with
men
of
narrow
and
ungenerous
spirits
this
sympathy
goes
not
beyond
a
slight
feeling
of
the
imagination
which
serves
only
to
excite
sentiments
of
complacency
or
ensure
and
makes
them
apply
to
the
object
either
honorable
or
dishonorable
appellations
a
griping
miser
for
instance
praises
extremely
industry
and
frugality
even
in
others
and
sets
them
in
his
estimation
above
all
the
other
virtues
he
knows
the
good
that
results
from
them
and
feels
that
species
of
happiness
with
a
more
lively
sympathy
than
any
other
you
could
represent
to
him
though
perhaps
he
would
not
part
with
a
shilling
to
make
the
fortune
of
the
industrious
man
whom
he
praises
so
highly
let
us
suppose
a
person
originally
framed
so
as
to
have
no
manner
of
concern
for
his
but
to
regard
the
happiness
and
misery
of
all
sensible
beings
with
greater
indifference
than
even
two
contiguous
shades
of
the
same
colour
let
us
suppose
if
the
prosperity
of
nations
were
laid
on
the
one
hand
and
their
ruin
on
the
other
and
he
were
desired
to
choose
that
he
would
stand
like
the
schoolman
ass
irresolute
and
undetermined
between
equal
motives
or
rather
like
the
same
ass
between
two
pieces
of
wood
or
marble
without
any
inclination
or
propensity
to
either
side
the
consequence
i
believe
must
be
allowed
just
that
such
a
person
being
absolutely
unconcerned
either
for
the
public
good
of
a
community
or
the
private
utility
of
others
would
look
on
every
quality
however
pernicious
or
however
beneficial
to
society
or
to
its
possessor
with
the
same
indifference
as
on
the
most
common
and
uninteresting
object
but
if
instead
of
this
fancied
monster
we
suppose
a
man
to
form
a
judgement
or
determination
in
the
case
there
is
to
him
a
plain
foundation
of
preference
where
everything
else
is
equal
and
however
cool
his
choice
may
be
if
his
heart
be
selfish
or
if
the
persons
interested
be
remote
from
him
there
must
still
be
a
choice
or
distinction
between
what
is
useful
and
what
is
pernicious
now
this
distinction
is
the
same
in
all
its
parts
with
the
moral
distinction
whose
foundation
has
been
so
often
and
so
much
in
vain
enquired
after
the
same
endowments
of
the
mind
in
every
circumstance
are
agreeable
to
the
sentiment
of
morals
and
to
that
of
humanity
the
same
temper
is
susceptible
of
high
degrees
of
the
one
sentiment
and
of
the
other
and
the
same
alteration
in
the
objects
by
their
nearer
approach
or
by
connexions
enlivens
the
one
and
the
other
by
all
the
rules
of
philosophy
therefore
we
must
conclude
that
these
sentiments
are
originally
the
same
since
in
each
particular
even
the
most
minute
they
are
governed
by
the
same
laws
and
are
moved
by
the
same
objects
why
do
philosophers
infer
with
the
greatest
certainty
that
the
moon
is
kept
in
its
orbit
by
the
same
force
of
gravity
that
makes
bodies
fall
near
the
surface
of
the
earth
but
because
these
effects
are
upon
computation
found
similar
and
equal
and
must
not
this
argument
bring
as
strong
conviction
in
moral
as
in
natural
disquisitions
to
prove
by
any
long
detail
that
all
the
qualities
useful
to
the
possessor
are
approved
of
and
the
contrary
censured
would
be
superfluous
the
least
reflection
on
what
is
every
day
experienced
in
life
will
be
sufficient
we
shall
only
mention
a
few
instances
in
order
to
remove
if
possible
all
doubt
and
hesitation
the
quality
the
most
necessary
for
the
execution
of
any
useful
enterprise
is
discretion
by
which
we
carry
on
a
safe
intercourse
with
others
give
due
attention
to
our
own
and
to
their
character
weigh
each
circumstance
of
the
business
which
we
undertake
and
employ
the
surest
and
safest
means
for
the
attainment
of
any
end
or
purpose
to
a
cromwell
perhaps
or
a
de

discretion
may
appear
an
virtue
as
dr
swift
calls
it
and
being
incompatible
with
those
vast
designs
to
which
their
courage
and
ambition
prompted
them
it
might
really
in
them
be
a
fault
or
imperfection
but
in
the
conduct
of
ordinary
life
no
virtue
is
more
requisite
not
only
to
obtain
success
but
to
avoid
the
most
fatal
miscarriages
and
disappointments
the
greatest
parts
without

observed

elegant

be
fatal

deprives
a
man
of
all
use
of
his
riches
and
checks
hospitality
and
every
social
enjoyment
is
justly
censured
on
a
double
account
prodigality
the
other
extreme
is
commonly
more
hurtful
to
a
man
himself
and
each
of
these
extremes
is
blamed
above
the
other
according
to
the
temper
of
the
person
who
censures
and
according
to
his
greater
or
less
sensibility
to
pleasure
either
social
or
sensual
qualities
often
derive
their
merit
from
complicated
sources
honesty
fidelity
truth
are
praised
for
their
immediate
tendency
to
promote
the
interests
of
society
but
after
those
virtues
are
once
established
upon
this
foundation
they
are
also
considered
as
advantageous
to
the
person
himself
and
as
the
source
of
that
trust
and
confidence
which
can
alone
give
a
man
any
consideration
in
life
one
becomes
contemptible
no
less
than
odious
when
he
forgets
the
duty
which
in
this
particular
he
owes
to
himself
as
well
as
to
society
perhaps
this
consideration
is
one
chief
source
of
the
high
blame
which
is
thrown
on
any
instance
of
failure
among
women
in
point
of
chastity
the
greatest
regard
which
can
be
acquired
by
that
sex
is
derived
from
their
fidelity
and
a
woman
becomes
cheap
and
vulgar
loses
her
rank
and
is
exposed
to
every
insult
who
is
deficient
in
this
particular
the
smallest
failure
is
here
sufficient
to
blast
her
character
a
female
has
so
many
opportunities
of
secretly
indulging
these
appetites
that
nothing
can
give
us
security
but
her
absolute
modesty
and
reserve
and
where
a
breach
is
once
made
it
can
scarcely
ever
be
fully
repaired
if
a
man
behave
with
cowardice
on
one
occasion
a
contrary
conduct
reinstates
him
in
his
character
but
by
what
action
can
a
woman
whose
behaviour
has
once
been
dissolute
be
able
to
assure
us
that
she
has
formed
better
resolutions
and
has
enough
to
carry
them
into
execution
all
men
it
is
allowed
are
equally
desirous
of
happiness
but
few
are
successful
in
the
pursuit
one
considerable
cause
is
the
want
of
strength
of
mind
which
might
enable
them
to
resist
the
temptation
of
present
ease
or
pleasure
and
carry
them
forward
in
the
search
of
more
distant
profit
and
enjoyment
our
affections
on
a
general
prospect
of
their
objects
form
certain
rules
of
conduct
and
certain
measures
of
preference
of
one
above
another
and
these
decisions
though
really
the
result
of
our
calm
passions
and
propensities
for
what
else
can
pronounce
any
object
eligible
or
the
contrary
are
yet
said
by
a
natural
abuse
of
terms
to
be
the
determinations
of
pure
reason
and
reflection
but
when
some
of
these
objects
approach
nearer
to
us
or
acquire
the
advantages
of
favourable
lights
and
positions
which
catch
the
heart
or
imagination
our
general
resolutions
are
frequently
confounded
a
small
enjoyment
preferred
and
lasting
shame
and
sorrow
entailed
upon
us
and
however
poets
may
employ
their
wit
and
eloquence
in
celebrating
present
pleasure
and
rejecting
all
distant
views
to
fame
health
or
fortune
it
is
obvious
that
this
practice
is
the
source
of
all
dissoluteness
and
disorder
repentance
and
misery
a
man
of
a
strong
and
determined
temper
adheres
tenaciously
to
his
general
resolutions
and
is
neither
seduced
by
the
allurements
of
pleasure
nor
terrified
by
the
menaces
of
pain
but
keeps
still
in
view
those
distant
pursuits
by
which
he
at
once
ensures
his
happiness
and
his
honour
at
least
in
some
degree
is
an
advantage
which
equally
attends
the
fool
and
the
wise
man
but
it
is
the
only
one
nor
is
there
any
other
circumstance
in
the
conduct
of
life
where
they
are
upon
an
equal
footing
business
books
conversation
for
all
of
these
a
fool
is
totally
incapacitated
and
except
condemned
by
his
station
to
the
coarsest
drudgery
remains
a
useless
burthen
upon
the
earth
accordingly
it
is
found
that
men
are
extremely
jealous
of
their
character
in
this
particular
and
many
instances
are
seen
of
profligacy
and
treachery
the
most
avowed
and
unreserved
none
of
bearing
patiently
the
imputation
of
ignorance

so
useful

their
rarity
their
novelty

the
nobleness
of
their

make
some
compensation
and
render
them
the
admiration
of
mankind
as

the

frequently
may
both
in

everything

we
scarcely
ever
hear
a
short
memory

for

in
ancient
times
when

could
make

were
too
delicate
to

that
of

the

surely
this

it
arises
can
never

deny

behaviour
besides
discretion
caution

industry
assiduity

besides
these
endowments
i
say
whose
very
names
force
an
avowal
of
their
merit
there
are
many
others
to
which
the

ever
deny
to
be
excellencies

as
their
merit
consists
in
their
tendency
to
serve
the
person
possessed
of
them
without
any
magnificent
claim
to
public
and
social
desert
we
are
the
less
jealous
of
their
pretensions
and
readily
admit
them
into
the
catalogue
of
laudable
qualities
we
are
not
sensible
that
by
this
concession
we
have
paved
the
way
for
all
the
other
moral
excellencies
and
can
not
consistently
hesitate
any
longer
with
regard
to
disinterested
benevolence
patriotism
and
humanity
it
seems
indeed
certain
that
first
appearances
are
here
as
usual
extremely
deceitful
and
that
it
is
more
difficult
in
a
speculative
way
to
resolve
into
the
merit
which
we
ascribe
to
the
selfish
virtues
above
mentioned
than
that
even
of
the
social
virtues
justice
and
beneficence
for
this
latter
purpose
we
need
but
say
that
whatever
conduct
promotes
the
good
of
the
community
is
loved
praised
and
esteemed
by
the
community
on
account
of
that
utility
and
interest
of
which
every
one
partakes
and
though
this
affection
and
regard
be
in
reality
gratitude
not
yet
a
distinction
even
of
this
obvious
nature
may
not
readily
be
made
by
superficial
reasoners
and
there
is
room
at
least
to
support
the
cavil
and
dispute
for
a
moment
but
as
qualities
which
tend
only
to
the
utility
of
their
possessor
without
any
reference
to
us
or
to
the
community
are
yet
esteemed
and
valued
by
what
theory
or
system
can
we
account
for
this
sentiment
from
or
deduce
it
from
that
favourite
origin
there
seems
here
a
necessity
for
confessing
that
the
happiness
and
misery
of
others
are
not
spectacles
entirely
indifferent
to
us
but
that
the
view
of
the
former
whether
in
its
causes
or
effects
like
sunshine
or
the
prospect
of
plains
to
carry
our
pretensions
no
higher
communicates
a
secret
joy
and
satisfaction
the
appearance
of
the
latter
like
a

landscape
throws
a
melancholy
damp

this
concession
being

made
the
difficulty
is
over
and

natural

life

it
may
not
be
improper
in
this
place
to
examine
the
influence
of
bodily
endowments
and
of
the
goods

fortune
over
our
sentiments
of
regard
and
esteem
and
to
consider
whether
these
phenomena
fortify
or
weaken
the
present
theory
it
will
naturally
be
expected
that
the
beauty
of
the
body
as
is
supposed
by
all
ancient
moralists
will
be
similar
in
some
respects
to
that
of
the
mind
and
that
every
kind
of
esteem
which
is
paid
to
a
man
will
have
something
similar
in
its
origin
whether
it
arise
from
his
mental
endowments
or
from
the
situation
of
his
exterior
circumstances
it
is
evident
that
one
considerable
source
of
beauty
in
all
animals
is
the
advantage
which
they
reap
from
the
particular
structure
of
their
limbs
and
members
suitably
to
the
particular
manner
of
life
to
which
they
are
by
nature
destined
the
just
proportions
of
a
horse
described
by
xenophon
and

are
the
same
that
are
received
at
this
day
by
our
modern
jockeys
because
the
foundation
of
them
is
the
same
namely
experience
of
what
is
detrimental
or
useful
in
the
animal
broad
shoulders
a
lank
belly
firm
joints
taper
legs
all
these
are
beautiful
in
our
species

signs
of
force
and
vigour
ideas
of
utility
and
its
contrary
though
they
do
not
entirely
determine
what
is
handsome
or
deformed
are
evidently
the
source
of
a
considerable
part
of
approbation
or
dislike
in
ancient
times
bodily
strength
and
dexterity
being
of
greater
use
and
importance
in
war
was
also
much
more
esteemed
and
valued
than
at
present
not
to
insist
on
homer
and
the
poets
we
may
observe
that
historians
scruple
not
to
mention
force
of
body
among
the
other
accomplishments
even
of
epaminondas

they
acknowledge
to
be
the
greatest

possessed

instance
is
similar
to
what
we
observed

with
regard
to
memory
what
derision
and
contempt
with
both
sexes
attend
impotence
while
the
unhappy
object
is
regarded
as
one
deprived
of
so
capital
a
pleasure
in
life
and
at
the
same
time
as
disabled
from
communicating
it
to
others
barrenness
in
women
being
also
a
species
of
inutility
is
a
reproach
but
not
in
the
same
degree
of
which
the
reason
is
very
obvious
according
to
the
present
theory
there
is
no
rule
in
painting
or
statuary
more
indispensible
than
that
of
balancing
the
figures
and
placing
them
with
the
greatest
exactness
on
their
proper
centre
of
gravity
a
figure
which
is
not
justly
balanced
is
ugly
because
it
conveys
the
disagreeable
ideas
of
fall
harm

pain
footenote
all
men
are
equally
liable
to
pain
and
disease
and
sickness
and
may
again
recover
health
and

these
circumstances
as
they
make
no
distinction
between
one
man
and
another
are
no
source
of
pride
or
humility
regard
or
contempt
but
comparing
our
own
species
to
superior
ones
it
is
a
very
mortifying
consideration
that
we
should
all
be
so
liable
to
diseases
and
infirmities
and
divines
accordingly
employ
this
topic
in
order
to
depress
and
vanity
they
would
have
more
success
if
the
common
bent
of
our
thoughts
were
not
perpetually
turned
to
compare
ourselves
with
others
the
infirmities
of

age
are
mortifying
because
a
comparison
with
the
young
may
take
place
the
king
evil
is
industriously
concealed

it
affects
others

is
often

the

scabs
a
disposition
or
turn
of
mind
which
qualifies
a
man
to
rise
in
the
world
and
advance
his
fortune
is
entitled
to
esteem
and
regard
as
has
already
been
explained
it
may
therefore
naturally
be
supposed
that
the
actual
possession
of
riches
and
authority
will
have
a
considerable
influence
over
these
sentiments
let
us
examine
any
hypothesis
by
which
we
can
account
for
the
regard
paid
to
the
rich
and
powerful
we
shall
find
none
satisfactory
but
that
which
derives
it
from
the
enjoyment
communicated
to
the
spectator
by
the
images
of
prosperity
happiness
ease
plenty
authority
and
the
gratification
of
every
appetite
for
instance
which
some
affect
so
much
to
consider
as
the
source
of
every
sentiment
is
plainly
insufficient
for
this
purpose
where
no
or
friendship
appears
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
on
what
we
can
found
our
hope
of
advantage
from
the
riches
of
others
though
we
naturally
respect
the
rich
even
before
they
discover
any
such
favourable
disposition
towards
us
we
are
affected
with
the
same
sentiments
when
we
lie
so
much
out
of
the
sphere
of
their
activity
that
they
can
not
even
be
supposed
to
possess
the
power
of
serving
us
a
prisoner
of
war
in
all
civilized
nations
is
treated
with
a
regard
suited
to
his
condition
and
riches
it
is
evident
go
far
towards
fixing
the
condition
of
any
person
if
birth
and
quality
enter
for
a
share
this
still
affords
us
an
argument
to
our
present
purpose
for
what
is
it
we
call
a
man
of
birth
but
one
who
is
descended
from
a
long
succession
of
rich
and
powerful
ancestors
and
who
acquires
our
esteem
by
his
connexion
with
persons
whom
we
esteem
his
ancestors
therefore
though
dead
are
respected
in
some
measure
on
account
of
their
riches
and
consequently
without
any
kind
of
expectation
but
not
to
go
so
far
as
prisoners
of
war
or
the
dead
to
find
instances
of
this
disinterested
regard
for
riches
we
may
only
observe
with
a
little
attention
those
phenomena
which
occur
in
common
life
and
conversation
a
man
who
is
himself
we
shall
suppose
of
a
competent
fortune
and
of
no
profession
being
introduced
to
a
company
of
strangers
naturally
treats
them
with
different
degrees
of
respect
as
he
is
informed
of
their
different
fortunes
and
conditions
though
it
is
impossible
that
he
can
so
suddenly
propose
and
perhaps
he
would
not
accept
of
any
pecuniary
advantage
from
them
a
traveller
is
always
admitted
into
company
and
meets
with
civility
in
proportion
as
his
train
and
equipage
speak
him
a
man
of
great
or
moderate
fortune
in
short
the
different
ranks
of
men
are
in
a
great
measure
regulated
by
riches
and
that
with
regard
to
superiors
as
well
as
inferiors
strangers
as
well
as
acquaintance
what
remains
therefore
but
to
conclude
that
as
riches
are
desired
for
ourselves
only
as
the
means
of
gratifying
our
appetites
either
at
present
or
in
some
imaginary
future
period
they
beget
esteem
in
others
merely
from
their
having
that
influence
this
indeed
is
their
very
nature
or
offence
they
have
a
direct
reference
to
the
commodities
conveniences
and
pleasures
of
life
the
bill
of
a
banker
who
is
broke
or
gold
in
a
desert
island
would
otherwise
be
full
as
valuable
when
we
approach
a
man
who
is
as
we
say
at
his
ease
we
are
presented
with
the
pleasing
ideas
of
plenty
satisfaction
cleanliness
warmth
a
cheerful
house
elegant
furniture
ready
service
and
whatever
is
desirable
in
meat
drink
or
apparel
on
the
contrary
when
a
poor
man
appears
the
disagreeable
images
of
want
penury
hard
labour
dirty
furniture
coarse
or
ragged
clothes
nauseous
meat
and
distasteful
liquor
immediately
strike
our
fancy
what
else
do
we
mean
by
saying
that
one
is
rich
the
other
poor
and
as
regard
or
contempt
is
the
natural
consequence
of
those
different
situations
in
life
it
is
easily
seen
what
additional
light
and
evidence
this
throws
on
our
preceding
theory
with
regard
to
all
moral
distinctions
footnote
there
is
something
extraordinary
and
seemingly
unaccountable
in
the
operation
of
our
passions
when
we
consider
the
fortune
and
situation
of
others
very
often
another
advancement
and
prosperity
produces
envy
which
has
a
strong
mixture
of
hatred
and
arises
chiefly
from
the
comparison
of
ourselves
with
the
person
at
the
very
same
time
or
at
least
in
very
short
intervals
we
may
feel
the
passion
of
respect
which
is
a
species
of
affection
or
with
a
mixture
of
humility
on
the
other
hand
the
misfortunes
of
our
fellows
often
cause
pity
which
has
in
it
a
strong
mixture
of
this
sentiment
of
pity
is
nearly
allied
to
contempt
which
is
a
species
of
dislike
with
a
mixture
of
pride

only
point
out
these
phenomena
as
a
subject
of
speculation
to
such
as
are
curious
with
regard
to
moral
enquiries
it
is
sufficient
for
the
present
purpose
to
observe
in
general
that
power
and
riches
commonly
cause
respect
poverty
and
meanness
contempt
though
particular
views
and
incidents
may
sometimes
raise
the
passions
of
envy
and
of
pity
a
man
who
has
cured
himself
of
all
ridiculous
and
is
fully
sincerely
and
steadily
convinced
from
experience
as
well
as
philosophy
that
the
difference
of
fortune
makes
less
difference
in
happiness
than
is
vulgarly
imagined
such
a
one
does
not
measure
out
degrees
of

according
to
the
of
his
acquaintance
he
may
indeed
externally
pay
a
superior
deference
to
the
great
lord
above
the
vassal
because
riches
are
the
most
convenient
being
the
most
fixed
and
determinate
source
of
distinction
but
his
internal
sentiments
are
more
regulated
by
the
personal
characters
of
men
than
by
the
accidental
and
capricious

of
qualities
immediately
agreeable
to
ourselves
whoever
has
passed
an
evening
with
serious
melancholy
people
and
has
observed
how
suddenly
the
conversation
was
animated
and
what
sprightliness
diffused
itself
over
the
countenance
discourse
and
behaviour
of
every
one
on
the
accession
of
a
lively
companion
such
a
one
will
easily
allow
that
cheerfulness
carries
great
merit
with
it
and
naturally
conciliates
the
of
mankind
no
quality
indeed
more
readily
communicates
itself
to
all
around
because
no
one
has
a
greater
propensity
to
display
itself
in
jovial
talk
and
pleasant
entertainment
the
flame
spreads
through
the
whole
circle
and
the
most
sullen
and
morose
are
often
caught
by
it
that
the
melancholy
hate
the
merry
even
though
horace
says
it
i
have
some
difficulty
to
allow
because
i
have
always
observed
that
where
the
jollity
is
moderate
and
decent
serious
people
are
so
much
the
more
delighted
as
it
dissipates
the
gloom
with
which
they
are
commonly
oppressed
and
gives
them
an
unusual
enjoyment
from
this
influence
of
cheerfulness
both
to
communicate
itself
and
to
engage
approbation
we
may
perceive
that
there
is
another
set
of
mental
qualities
which
without
any
utility
or
any
tendency
to
farther
good
either
of
the
community
or
of
the
possessor
diffuse
a
satisfaction
on
the
beholders
and
procure
friendship
and
regard
their
immediate
sensation
to
the
person
possessed
of
them
is
agreeable
others
enter
into
the
same
humour
and
catch
the
sentiment
by
a
contagion
or
natural
sympathy
and
as
we
can
not
forbear
loving
whatever
pleases
a
kindly
emotion
arises
towards
the
person
who
communicates
so
much
satisfaction
he
is
a
more
animating
spectacle
his
presence
diffuses
over
us
more
serene
complacency
and
enjoyment
our
imagination
entering
into
his
feelings
and
disposition
is
affected
in
a
more
agreeable
manner
than
if
a
melancholy
dejected
sullen
anxious
temper
were
presented
to
us
hence
the
affection
and
probation
which
attend
the
former
the
aversion
and
disgust
with
which
we
regard
the
latter

no

when
the

they
disfigure

as

adds
are
commonly
dangerous

also
having
little
enjoyment

themselves
they
can
never

contribute
to
social
entertainment
in
all
polite
nations

a
relish
for
pleasure
if
accompanied
with
temperance

decency
is
esteemed
a
considerable
merit
even
in
the
greatest
men

becomes
still
more
requisite
in
those
of

ethics
of
homer
are
in
this
particular
very
different
from
those
of
fenelon
his
elegant
imitator
and
such
as
were
well
suited
to
an
age
when
one
hero
as
remarked
by
thucydides
could
ask
another
without
offence
whether
he
were
a
robber
or
not
such
also
very
lately
was
the
system
of
ethics
which
prevailed
in
many
barbarous
parts
of
ireland
if
we
may
credit
spencer
in
his
judicious
account
of
the
state
of
that
kingdom
footnote
from
spencer
it
is
a
common
use
says
he
amongst
their
gentlemen
sons
that
as
soon
as
they
are
able
to
use
their
weapons
they
strait
gather
to
themselves
three
or
four
stragglers
or
kern
with
whom
wandering
a
while
up
and
down
idly
the
country
taking
only
meat
he
at
last
falleth
into
some
bad
occasion
that
shall
be
offered
which
being
once
made
known
he
is
thenceforth
counted
a
man
of
worth
in
whom
there
is
courage
of
the
same
class
of
virtues
with
courage
is
that
undisturbed
philosophical
tranquillity
superior
to
pain
sorrow
anxiety
and
each
assault
of
adverse
fortune
conscious
of
his
own
virtue
say
the
philosophers
the
sage
elevates
himself
above
every
accident
of
life
and
securely
placed
in
the
temple
of
wisdom
looks
down
on
inferior
mortals
engaged
in
pursuit
of
honours
riches
reputation
and
every
frivolous
enjoyment
these
pretentious
no
doubt
when
stretched
to
the
utmost
are
by
far
too
magnificent
for
human
nature
they
carry
however
a
grandeur
with
them
which
seizes
the
spectator
and
strikes
him
with
admiration
and
the
nearer
we
can
approach
in
practice
to
this
sublime
tranquillity
and
indifference
for
we
must
distinguish
it
from
a
stupid
insensibility
the
more
secure
enjoyment
shall
we
attain
within
ourselves
and
the
more
greatness
of
mind
shall
we
discover
to
the
world
the
philosophical
tranquillity
may
indeed
be
considered
only
as
a
branch
of
magnanimity
who
admires
not
socrates
his
perpetual
serenity
and
contentment
amidst
the
greatest
poverty
and
domestic
vexations
his
resolute
contempt
of
riches
and
his
magnanimous
care
of
preserving
liberty
while
he
refused
all
assistance
from
his
friends
and
disciples
and
avoided
even
the
dependence
of
an
obligation
epictetus
had
not
so
much
as
a
door
to
his
little
house
or
hovel
and
therefore
soon
lost
his
iron
lamp
the
only
furniture
which
he
had
worth
taking
but
resolving
to
disappoint
all
robbers
for
the
future
he
supplied
its
place
with
an
earthen
lamp
of
which
he
very
peacefully
kept
possession
ever
after
among
the
ancients
the
heroes
in
philosophy
as
well
as
those
in
war
and
patriotism
have
a
grandeur
and
force
of
sentiment
which
astonishes
our
narrow
souls
and
is
rashly
rejected
as
extravagant
and
supernatural
they
in
their
turn
i
allow
would
have
had
equal
reason
to
consider
as
romantic
and
incredible
the
degree
of
humanity
clemency
order
tranquillity
and
other
social
virtues
to
which
in
the
administration
of
government
we
have
attained
in
modern
times
had
any
one
been
then
able
to
have
made
a
fair
representation
of
them
such
is
the
compensation
which
nature
or
rather
education
has
made
in
the
distribution
of
excellencies
and
virtues
in
those
different
ages
the
merit
of
benevolence
arising
from
its
utility
and
its
tendency
to
promote
the
good
of
mankind
has
been
already
explained
and
is
no
doubt
the
source
of
a
considerable
part
of
that
esteem
which
is
so
universally
paid
to
it
but
it
will
also
be
allowed
that
the
very
softness
and
tenderness
of
the
sentiment
its
engaging
endearments
its
fond
expressions
its
delicate
attentions
and
all
that
flow
of
mutual
confidence
and
regard
which
enters
into
a
warm
attachment
of
love
and
friendship
it
will
be
allowed
i
say
that
these
feelings
being
delightful
in
themselves
are
necessarily
communicated
to
the
spectators
and
melt
them
into
the
same
fondness
and
delicacy
the
tear
naturally
starts
in
our
eye
on
the
apprehension
of
a
warm
sentiment
of
this
nature
our
breast
heaves
our
heart
is
agitated
and
every
humane
tender
principle
of
our
frame
is
set
in
motion
and
gives
us
the
purest
and
most
satisfactory
enjoyment
when
poets
form
descriptions
of
elysian
fields
where
the
blessed
inhabitants
stand
in
no
need
of
each
other
assistance
they
yet
represent
them
as
maintaining
a
constant
intercourse
of
love
and
friendship
and
sooth
our
fancy
with
the
pleasing
image
of
these
soft
and
gentle
passions
the
idea
of
tender
tranquillity
in

roughness

harshness
of

us

suffer

remain

even
though
certain
that
no

follow

a
certain
proof
that
the
whole
merit
of
benevolence
is
not
derived
from
its
usefulness
we
may
observe
that
in
a
kind
way
of
blame
we
say
a
person
is
too
good
when
he
exceeds
his
part
in
society
and
carries
his
attention
for
others
beyond
the
proper
bounds
in
like
manner
we
say
a
man
is
too
too
intrepid
too
indifferent
about
fortune
reproaches
which
really
at
bottom
imply
more
esteem
than
many
panegyrics
being
accustomed
to
rate
the
merit
and
demerit
of
characters
chiefly
by
their
useful
or
pernicious
tendencies
we
can
not
forbear
applying
the
epithet
of
blame
when
we
discover
a
sentiment
which
rises
to
a
degree
that
is
hurtful
but
it
may
happen
at
the
same
time
that
its
noble
elevation
or
its
engaging
tenderness
so
seizes
the
heart
as
rather
to
increase
our
friendship
and
concern
for
the
person

cheerfulness
could
scarce
admit
of
blame
from
its
excess
were
it

that
dissolute
mirth
without
a
proper

a
sure
symptom
and
characteristic
of
folly
and
on
that
account
disgustful
the
amours
and
attachments
of

all
the

can
sympathize
with
the
tender

will
allow
that
this
very
weakness
for

will
readily
call

have
such
splendour
and
greatness
in
their
appearance
as
strikes
us
with
admiration
and
they
might
in
some
degree
be
even
approved
of
if
they
betrayed
not
sometimes
too
evident
symptoms
of
madness
and
disorder
the
athenians
pretended
to
the
first
invention
of
agriculture
and
of
laws
and
always
valued
themselves
extremely
on
the
benefit
thereby
procured
to
the
whole
race
of
mankind
they
also
boasted
and
with
reason
of
their
war
like
enterprises
particularly
against
those
innumerable
fleets
and
armies
of
persians
which
invaded
greece
during
the
reigns
of
darius
and
xerxes
but
though
there
be
no
comparison
in
point
of
utility
between
these
peaceful
and
military
honours
yet
we
find
that
the
orators
who
have
writ
such
elaborate
panegyrics
on
that
famous
city
have
chiefly
triumphed
in
displaying
the
warlike
achievements
lysias
thucydides
plato
and
isocrates
discover
all
of
them
the
same
partiality
which
though
condemned
by
calm
reason
and
reflection
appears
so
natural
in
the
mind
of
man
it
is
observable
that
the
great
charm
of
poetry
consists
in
lively
pictures
of
the
sublime
passions
magnanimity
courage
disdain
of
fortune
or
those
of
the
tender
affections
love
and
friendship
which
warm
the
heart
and
diffuse
over
it
similar
sentiments
and
emotions
and
though
all
kinds
of
passion
even
the
most
disagreeable
such
as
grief
and
anger
are
observed
when
excited
by
poetry
to
convey
a
satisfaction
from
a
mechanism
of
nature
not
easy
to
be
explained
yet
those
more
elevated
or
softer
affections
have
a
peculiar
influence
and
please
from
more
than
one
cause
or
principle
not
to
mention
that
they
alone
interest
us
in
the
fortune
of
the
persons
represented
or
communicate
any
esteem
and
affection
for
their
character
and
can
it
possibly
be
doubted
that
this
talent
itself
of
poets
to
move
the
passions
this
pathetic
and
sublime
of
sentiment
is
a
very
considerable
merit
and
being
enhanced
by
its
extreme
rarity
may
exalt
the
person
possessed
of
it
above
every
character
of
the
age
in
which
he
lives
the
prudence
address
steadiness
and
benign
government
of
augustus
adorned
with
all
the
splendour
of
his
noble
birth
and
imperial
crown
render
him
but
an
unequal
competitor
for
fame
with
virgil
who
lays
nothing
into
the
opposite
scale
but
the
divine
beauties
of
his
poetical
genius
the
very
sensibility
to
these
beauties
or
a
delicacy
of
taste
is
itself
a
beauty
in
any
character
as
conveying
the
purest
the
most
durable
and
most
innocent
of
all
enjoyments
these
are
some
instances
of
the
several
species
of
merit
that
are
valued
for
the
immediate
pleasure
which
they
communicate
to
the
person
possessed
of
them
no
views
of
utility
or
of
future
beneficial
consequences
enter
into
this
sentiment
of
approbation
yet
is
it
of
a
kind
similar
to
that
other
sentiment
which
arises
from
views
of
a
public
or
private
utility
the
same
social
sympathy
we
may
observe
or
with
human
happiness
or
misery
gives
rise
to
both
and
this
analogy
in
all
the
parts
of
the
present
theory
may
justly
be
regarded
as
a
confirmation
of
it
section
viii
of
qualities
immediately
agreeable

footnote
it
is
the
nature
and
indeed
the
definition
of
virtue
that
it
is
a
quality
of
the
mind
agreeable
to
or
approved
of
by
every
one
who
considers
or
contemplates
it
but
some
qualities
produce
pleasure
because
they
are
useful
to
society
or
useful
or
agreeable
to
the
person
himself
others
produce
it
more
immediately
which
is
the
case
with
the
class
of
virtues
here
considered
as
the
mutual
shocks
in
society
and
the
oppositions
of
interest
and
have
constrained
mankind
to

preserve

advantages
of

and
protection
in

of

and
have
introduced
the
rules
of

or

in

to

and
an
easy
stream
of
conversation
maintained
without
vehemence
without
interruption
without
eagerness
for
victory
and
without
any
airs
of
superiority
these
attentions
and
regards
are
immediately
agreeable
to
others
abstracted
from
any
consideration
of
utility
or
beneficial
tendencies
they
conciliate
affection
promote
esteem
and
extremely
enhance
the
merit
of
the
person
who
regulates
his
behaviour
by
them
many
of
the
forms
of
breeding
are
arbitrary
and
casual
but
the
thing
expressed
by
them
is
still
the
same
a
spaniard
goes
out
of
his
own
house
before
his
guest
to
signify
that
he
leaves
him
master
of
all
in

countries
the
landlord
walks
out
last
as
a
common
mark
of
deference
and
regard
but
in
order
to
render
a
man
perfect
good
company
he
must
have
wit
and
ingenuity
as
well
as
good
manners
what
wit
is
it
may
not
be
easy
to
define
but
it
is
easy
surely
to
determine
that
it
is
a
quality
immediately
agreeable
to
others
and
communicating
on
its
first
appearance
a
lively
joy
and
satisfaction
to
every
one
who
has
any
comprehension
of
it
the
most
profound
metaphysics
indeed
might
be
employed
in
explaining
the
various
kinds
and
species
of
wit
and
many
classes
of
it
which
are
now
received
on
the
sole
testimony
of
taste
and
sentiment
might
perhaps
be
resolved
into
more
general
principles
but
this
is
sufficient
for
our
present
purpose
that
it
does
affect
taste
and
sentiment
and
bestowing
an
immediate
enjoyment
is
a
sure
source
of
approbation
and
affection
in
countries
where
men
pass
most
of
their
time
in
conversation
and
visits
and
assemblies
these
companionable
qualities
so
to
speak
are
of
high
estimation
and
form
a
chief
part
of
personal
merit
in
countries
where
men
live
a
more
domestic
life
and
either
are
employed
in
business
or
amuse
themselves
in
a
narrower
circle
of
acquaintance
the
more
solid
qualities
are
chiefly
regarded
thus
i
have
often
observed
that
among
the
french
the
first
questions
with
regard
to
a
stranger
are
is
he
polite
has
he
wit
in
our
own
country
the
chief
praise
bestowed
is
always
that
of
a
sensible
fellow
in
conversation
the
lively
spirit
of
dialogue
is
agreeable
even
to
those
who
desire
not
to
have
any
share
in
the
discourse
hence
the
teller
of
long
stories
or
the
pompous
declaimer
is
very
little
approved
of
but
most
men
desire
likewise
their
turn
in
the
conversation
and
regard
with
a
very
evil
eye
that
loquacity
which
deprives
them
of
a
right
they
are
naturally
so
jealous
of
there
is
a
sort
of
harmless
liars
frequently
to
be
met
with
in
company
who
deal
much
in
the
marvellous
their
usual
intention
is
to
please
and
entertain
but
as
men
are
most
delighted
with
what
they
conceive
to
be
truth
these
people
mistake
extremely
the
means
of
pleasing
and
incur
universal
blame
some
indulgence
however
to
lying
or
fiction
is
given
in
humorous
stories
because
it
is
there
really
agreeable
and
entertaining
and
truth
is
not
of
any
importance
eloquence
genius
of
all
kinds
even
good
sense
and
sound
reasoning
when
it
rises
to
an
eminent
degree
and
is
employed
upon
subjects
of
any
considerable
dignity
and
nice
discernment
all
these
endowments
seem
immediately
agreeable
and
have
a
merit
distinct
from
their
usefulness
rarity
likewise
which
so
much
enhances
the
price
of
every
thing
must
set
an
additional
value
on
these
noble
talents
of
the
human
mind
modesty
may
be
understood
in
different
senses
even
abstracted
from
chastity
which
has
been
already
treated
of
it
sometimes
means
that
tenderness
and
nicety
of
honour
that
apprehension
of
blame
that
dread
of
intrusion
or
injury
towards
others
that
pudor
which
is
the
proper
guardian
of
every
kind
of
virtue
and
a
sure
preservative
against
vice
and
corruption
but
its
most
usual
meaning
is
when
it
is
opposed
to
impudence
and
arrogance
and
expresses
a
diffidence
of
our
own
judgement
and
a
due
attention
and
regard
for
others
in
young
men
chiefly
this
quality
is
a
sure
sign
of
good
sense
and
is
also
the
certain
means
of
augmenting
that
endowment
by
preserving
their
ears
open
to
instruction
and
making
them
still
grasp
after
new
attainments
but
it
has
a
further
charm
to
every
spectator
by
flattering
every
vanity
and
presenting
the
appearance
of
a
docile
pupil
who
receives
with
proper
attention
and
respect
every
word
they
utter
men
have
in
general
a
much
greater
propensity
to
overvalue
than
undervalue
themselves

ad
this
makes
us

jealous

the
excess

peculiar
indulgence
all

to
modesty

as
esteeming

danger

falling
into
any
vicious
extreme

break

has
established
it
as

in

not

may

of

in

a
generous
spirit
and
well
founded
decently
disguised
and
courageously
supported
under
distress
and
calumny
is
a
great
excellency
and
seems
to
derive
its
merit
from
the
noble
elevation
of
its
sentiment
or
its
immediate
agreeableness
to
its
possessor
in
ordinary
characters
we
approve
of
a
bias
towards
modesty
which
is
a
quality
immediately
agreeable
to
others
the
vicious
excess
of
the
former
virtue
namely
insolence
or
haughtiness
is
immediately
disagreeable
to
others
the
excess
of
the
latter
is
so

the

thus
are
the
boundaries
of
these
duties
adjusted
a
desire
of
fame
reputation
or
a
character
with
others
is
so
far
from
being
blameable
that
it
seems
inseparable
from
virtue
genius
capacity
and
a
generous

noble
disposition
an
attention
even
to
trivial

is
also
expected

demanded
by

no
one
is
surprised
if
he
find
a
man
in

to
observe
a
greater
elegance
of
dress
and
more
pleasant
flow
of
conversation
than
when
he
passes
his
time
at
home
and
with
his
own
family
wherein
then
consists
vanity
which
is
so
justly
regarded
as
a
fault
or
imperfection
it
seems
to
consist
chiefly
in
such
an
intemperate
display
of
our
advantages
honours
and
accomplishments
in
such
an
importunate
and
open
demand
of
praise
and
admiration
as
is
offensive
to
others
and
encroaches
too
far
on
their
secret
vanity
and
ambition
it
is
besides
a
sure
symptom
of
the
want
of
true
dignity
and
elevation
of
mind
which
is
so
great
an
ornament
in
any
character
for
why
that
impatient
desire
of
applause
as
if
you
were
not
justly
entitled
to
it
and
might
not
reasonably
expect
that
it
would
for
ever
at

you
why

to
inform

of
the

you
have
kept

you

you
met

if
these
were
not

what
we

readily
of

have
imagined
without

told
of

decency
or
a
proper
regard
to
age

in

may
be
ranked
among
the
qualities
which
are
immediately
agreeable
to

which
by
that
means
acquire
praise
and
approbation
an
effeminate
behaviour
in
a
man
a
rough
manner
in
a
woman
these
are
ugly
because
unsuitable
to
each
character
and
different
from
the
qualities
which
we
expect
in
the
sexes
it
is
as
if
a
tragedy
abounded
in
comic
beauties
or
a
comedy
in
tragic
the
disproportions
hurt
the
eye
and
convey
a
disagreeable
sentiment
to
the
spectators
the
source
of
blame
and
disapprobation
this
is
that
indecorum
which
is
explained
so
much
at
large
by
cicero
in
his
offices
among
the
other
virtues
we
may
also
give
cleanliness
a
place
since
it
naturally
renders
us
agreeable
to
others

is
no
inconsiderable
source
of
love
and
affection
no
one
will
deny
that
a
negligence
in
this
particular
is
a
fault
and
as
faults
are
nothing
but
smaller
vices
and
this
fault
can
have
no
other
origin
than
the
uneasy
sensation
which
it
excites
in
others
we
may
in
this
instance
seemingly
so
trivial
clearly
discover
the
origin
of
moral
distinctions
about
which
the
learned
have
involved
themselves
in
such
mazes
of
perplexity
and
error
but
besides
all
the
agreeable
qualities
the
origin
of
whose
beauty
we
can
in
some
degree
explain
and
account
for
there
still
remains
something
mysterious
and
inexplicable
which
conveys
an
immediate
satisfaction
to
the
spectator
but
how
or
why
or
for
what
reason
he
can
not
pretend
to
determine
there
is
a
manner
a
grace
an
ease
a
genteelness
an
which
some
men
possess
above
others
which
is
very
different
from
external
beauty
and
comeliness
and
which
however
catches
our
affection
almost
as
suddenly
and
powerfully
and
though
this
manner
be
chiefly
talked
of
in
the
passion
between
the
sexes
where
the
concealed
magic
is
easily
explained
yet
surely
much
of
it
prevails
in
all
our
estimation
of
characters
and
forms
no
inconsiderable
part
of
personal
merit
this
class
of
accomplishments
therefore
must
be
trusted
entirely
to
the
blind
but
sure
testimony
of
taste
and
sentiment
and
must
be
considered
as
a
part
of
ethics
left
by
nature
to
baffle
all
the
pride
of
philosophy
and
make
her
sensible
of
her
narrow
boundaries
and
slender
acquisitions
we
approve
of
another

of
his

politeness
modesty
decency

any
agreeable
quality
which
he
possesses
although
he
be
not
of
our
acquaintance

any
entertainment
by
means
of
these
accomplishments
the
idea

we
form
of
their
effect
on
his
acquaintance
has
an
agreeable
influence
on
our
imagination

conclusion
part
i
it
may
justly
appear
surprising
that
any
man
in
so
late
an
age
should
find
it
requisite
to
prove
by
elaborate
reasoning
that
personal
merit
consists
altogether
in
the
possession
of
mental
qualities
useful
or
agreeable
to
the
person
himself
or
to
others
it
might
be
expected
that
this
principle
would
have
occurred
even
to
the
first
rude
unpractised
enquirers
concerning
morals
and
been
received
from
its
own
evidence
without
any
argument
or
disputation
whatever
is
valuable
in
any
kind
so
naturally
classes
itself
under
the
division
of
useful
or
agreeable
the
utile
or
the
dulce
that
it
is
not
easy
to
imagine
why
we
should
ever
seek
further
or
consider
the
question
as
a
matter
of
nice
research
or
inquiry
and
as
every
thing
useful
or
agreeable
must
possess
these
qualities
with
regard
either
to
the
person
himself
or
to
others
the
complete
delineation
or
description
of
merit
seems
to
be
performed
as
naturally
as
a
shadow
is
cast
by
the
sun
or
an
image
is
reflected
upon
water
if
the
ground
on
which
the
shadow
is
cast
be
not
broken
and
uneven
nor
the
surface
from
which
the
image
is
reflected
disturbed
and
confused
a
just
figure
is
immediately
presented
without
any
art
or
attention
and
it
seems
a
reasonable
presumption
that
systems
and
hypotheses
have
perverted
our
natural
understanding
when
a
theory
so
simple
and
obvious
could
so
long
have
escaped
the
most
elaborate
examination
but
however
the
case
may
have
fared
with
philosophy
in
common
life
these
principles
are
still
implicitly
maintained
nor
is
any
other
topic
of
praise
or
blame
ever
recurred
to
when
we
employ
any
panegyric
or
satire
any
applause
or
censure
of
human
action
and
behaviour
if
we
observe
men
in
every
intercourse
of
business
or
pleasure
in
every
discourse
and
conversation
we
shall
find
them
nowhere

the
schools
at
any
loss
upon
this
subject

not

struck
out
by

runs
through
the
whole
tenor
of
his

preserves

perpetual
serenity

in
his

has
met
with

delineated

of

each
of
you
has
given
a
stroke
of
the

to
his
figure
and
you
have
unawares
exceeded
all
the
pictures
drawn
by
gratian

select
this
character
as
a
model
of
perfect
virtue
and
as
every
quality
which
is
useful
or
agreeable
to
ourselves
or
others
is
in
common
life
allowed
to
be
a
part
of
personal
merit
so
no
other
will
ever
be
received
where
men
judge
of
things
by
their
natural
unprejudiced
reason
without
the
delusive
glosses
of
superstition
and
false
religion
celibacy
fasting
penance
mortification
humility
silence
solitude
and
the
whole
train
of
monkish
virtues
for
what
reason
are
they
everywhere
rejected
by
men
of
sense
but
because
they
serve
to
no
manner
of
purpose
neither
advance
a
man
fortune
in
the
world
nor
render
him
a
more
valuable
member
of
society
neither
qualify
him
for
the
entertainment
of
company
nor
increase
his
power
of

observe
on
the
contrary
that
they
cross
all
these
desirable
ends
stupify
the
understanding
and
harden

fancy
and
sour
the
temper

justly
therefore
transfer
them
to
the
opposite
column
and
place
them
in
the
catalogue
of
vices
nor
has
any
superstition
force
sufficient
among
men
of
the
world
to
pervert
entirely
these
natural
sentiments
a
gloomy
enthusiast
after
his
death
may
have
a
place
in
the
calendar
but
will
scarcely
ever
be
admitted
when
alive
into
intimacy
and
society
except
by
those
who
are
as
delirious
and
dismal
as
himself
it
seems
a
happiness
in
the
present
theory
that
it
enters
not
into
that
vulgar
dispute
concerning
the
degrees
of
benevolence
or
which
prevail
in
human
nature
a
dispute
which
is
never
likely
to
have
any
issue
both
because
men
who
have
taken
part
are
not
easily
convinced
and
because
the
phenomena
which
can
be
produced
on
either
side
are
so
dispersed
so
uncertain
and
subject
to
so
many
interpretations
that
it
is
scarcely
possible
accurately
to
compare
them
or
draw
from
them
any
determinate
inference
or
conclusion
it
is
sufficient
for
our
present
purpose
if
it
be
allowed
what
surely
without
the
greatest
absurdity
can
not
be
disputed
that
there
is
some
benevolence
however
small
infused
into
our
bosom
some
spark
of
friendship
for
human
kind
some
particle
of
the
dove
kneaded
into
our
frame
along
with
the
elements
of
the
wolf
and
serpent
let
these
generous
sentiments
be
supposed
ever
so
weak
let
them
be
insufficient
to
move
even
a
hand
or
finger
of
our
body
they
must
still
direct
the
determinations
of
our
mind
and
where
everything
else
is
equal
produce
a
cool
preference
of
what
is
useful
and
serviceable
to
mankind
above
what
is
pernicious
and
dangerous
a
moral
distinction
therefore
immediately
arises
a
general
sentiment
of
blame
and
approbation
a
tendency
however
faint
to
the
objects
of
the
one
and
a
proportionable
aversion
to
those
of
the
other
nor
will
those
reasoners
who
so
earnestly
maintain
the
predominant
selfishness
of
human
kind
be
any
wise
scandalized
at
hearing
of
the
weak
sentiments
of
virtue
implanted
in
our
nature
on
the
contrary
they
are
found
as
ready
to
maintain
the
one
tenet
as
the
other
and
their
spirit
of
satire
for
such
it
appears
rather
than
of
corruption
naturally
gives
rise
to
both
opinions
which
have
indeed
a
great
and
almost
an
indissoluble
connexion
together

vanity
and
all

here
excluded
from
our
theory
concerning
the
origin
of
morals
not
because
they
are
too
weak
but
because
they
have
not
a
proper
direction
for
that
purpose
the
notion
of
morals
implies
some
sentiment
common
to
all
mankind
which
recommends
the
same
object
to
general
approbation
and
makes
every
man
or
most
men
agree
in
the
same
opinion
or
decision
concerning
it
it
also
implies
some
sentiment
so
universal
and
comprehensive
as
to
extend
to
all
mankind
and
render
the
actions
and
conduct
even
of
the
persons
the
most
remote
an
object
of
applause
or
censure
according
as
they
agree
or
disagree
with
that
rule
of
right
which
is
established
these
two
requisite
circumstances
belong
alone
to
the
sentiment
of
humanity
here
insisted
on
the
other
passions
produce
in
every
breast
many
strong
sentiments
of
desire
and
aversion
affection
and
hatred
but
these
neither
are
felt
so
much
in
common
nor
are
so
comprehensive
as
to
be
the
foundation
of
any
general
system
and
established
theory
of
blame
or
approbation
when
a
man
denominates
another
his
enemy
his
rival
his
antagonist
his
adversary
he
is
understood
to
speak
the
language
of
and
to
express
sentiments
peculiar
to
himself
and
arising
from
his
particular
circumstances
and
situation
but
when
he
bestows
on
any
man
the
epithets
of
vicious
or
odious
or
depraved
he
then
speaks
another
language
and
expresses
sentiments
in
which
he
expects
all
his
audience
are
to
concur
with
him
he
must
here
therefore
depart
from
his
private
and
particular
situation
and
must
choose
a
point
of
view
common
to
him
with
others
he
must
move
some
universal
principle
of
the
human
frame
and
touch
a
string
to
which
all
mankind
have
an
accord
and
symphony
if
he
mean
therefore
to
express
that
this
man
possesses
qualities
whose
tendency
is
pernicious
to
society
he
has
chosen
this
common
point
of
view
and
has
touched
the
principle
of
humanity
in
which
every
man
in
some
degree
concurs
while
the
human
heart
is
compounded
of
the
same
elements
as
at
present
it
will
never
be
wholly
indifferent
to
public
good
nor
entirely
unaffected
with
the
tendency
of
characters
and
manners
and
though
this
affection
of
humanity
may
not
generally
be
esteemed
so
strong
as
vanity
or
ambition
yet
being
common
to
all
men
it
can
alone
be
the
foundation
of
morals
or
of
system
of
blame
or
praise
one
man
ambition
is
not
another
ambition
nor
will
the
same
event
or
object
satisfy
both
but
the
humanity
of
one
man
is
the
humanity
of
every
one
and
the
same
object
touches
this
passion
in
all
human
creatures
but
the
sentiments
which
arise
from
humanity
are
not
only
the
same
in
all
human
creatures
and
produce
the
same
approbation
or
censure
but
they
also
comprehend
all
human
creatures
nor
is
there
any
one
whose
conduct
or
character
is
not
by
their
means
an
object
to
every
one
of
censure
or
approbation
on
the
contrary
those
other
passions
commonly
denominated
selfish
both
produce
different
sentiments
in
each
individual
according
to
his
particular
situation
and
also
contemplate
the
greater
part
of
mankind
with
the
utmost
indifference
and
unconcern
whoever
has
a
high
regard
and
esteem
for
me
flatters
my
vanity
whoever
expresses
contempt
mortifies
and
displeases
me
but
as
my
name
is
known
but
to
a
small
part
of
mankind
there
are
few
who
come
within
the
sphere
of
this
passion
or
excite
on
its
account
either
my
affection
or
disgust
but
if
you
represent
a
tyrannical
insolent
or
barbarous
behaviour
in
any
country
or
in
any
age
of
the
world
i
soon
carry
my
eye
to
the
pernicious
tendency
of
such
a
conduct
and
feel
the
sentiment
of
repugnance
and
displeasure
towards
it
no
character
can
be
so
remote
as
to
be
in
this
light
wholly
indifferent
to
me
what
is
beneficial
to
society
or
to
the
person
himself
must
still
be
preferred
and
every
quality
or
action
of
every
human
being
must
by
this
means
be
ranked
under
some
class
or
denomination
expressive
of
general
censure
or
applause
what
more
therefore
can
we
ask
to
distinguish
the
sentiments
dependent
on
humanity
from
those
connected
with
any
other
passion
or
to
satisfy
us
why
the
former
are
the
origin
of
morals
not
the
latter
whatever
conduct
gains
my
approbation
by
touching
my
humanity
procures
also
the
applause
of
all
mankind
by
affecting
the
same
principle
in
them
but
what
serves
my
avarice
or
ambition
pleases
these
passions
in
me
alone
and
affects
not
the
avarice
and
ambition
of
the
rest
of
mankind
there
is
no
circumstance
of
conduct
in
any
man
provided
it
have
a
beneficial
tendency
that
is
not
agreeable
to
my
humanity
however
remote
the
person
but
every
man
so
far
removed
as
neither
to
cross
nor
serve
my
avarice
and
ambition
is
regarded
as
wholly
indifferent
by
those
passions
the
distinction
therefore
between
these
species
of
sentiment
being
so
great
and
evident
language
must
soon
be
moulded
upon
it
and
must
invent
a
peculiar
set
of
terms
in
order
to
express
those
universal
sentiments
of
censure
or
approbation
which
arise
from
humanity
or
from
views
of
general
usefulness
and
its
contrary
virtue
and
vice
become
then
known
morals
are
recognized
certain
general
ideas
are
framed
of
human
conduct
and
behaviour
such
measures
are
expected
from
men
in
such
situations
this
action
is
determined
to
be
conformable
to
our
abstract
rule
that
other
contrary
and
by
such
universal
principles
are
the
particular
sentiments
of
frequently
controlled
and
limited
footnote
it
seems
certain
both
from
reason
and
experience
that
a
rude
untaught
savage
regulates
chiefly
his
love
and
hatred
by
the
ideas
of
private
utility
and
injury
and
has
but
faint
conceptions
of
a
general
rule
or
system
of
behaviour
the
man
who
stands
opposite
to
him
in
battle
he
hates
heartedly
not
only
for
the
present
moment
which
is
almost
unavoidable
but
for
ever
after
nor
is
he
satisfied
without
the
most
extreme
punishment
and
vengeance
but
we
accustomed
to
society
and
to
more
enlarged
reflections
consider
that
this
man
is
serving
his
own
country
and
community
that
any
man
in
the
same
situation
would
do
the
same
that
we
ourselves
in
like
circumstances
observe
a
like
conduct
that
in
general
human
society
is
best
supported
on
such
maxims
and
by
these
suppositions
and
views
we
correct
in
some
measure
our
ruder
and
narrower
positions
and
though
much
of
our
friendship
and
enemity
be
still
regulated
by
private
considerations
of
benefit
and
harm
we
pay
at
least
this
homage
to
general
rules
which
we
are
accustomed
to
respect
that
we
commonly
perver
our
adversary
conduct
by
imputing
malice
or
injustice
to
him
in
order
to
give
vent
to
those
passions
which
arise
from
and
private
interest
when
the
heart
is
full
of
rage
it
never
wants
pretences
of
this
nature
though
sometimes
as
frivolous
as
those
from
which
horace
being
almost
crushed
by
the
fall
of
a
tree
effects
to
accuse
of
parricide
the
first
planter
of
it
from
instances
of
popular
tumults
seditions
factions
panics
and
of
all
passions
which
are
shared
with
a
multitude
we
may
learn
the
influence
of
society
in
exciting
and
supporting
any
emotion
while
the
most
ungovernable
disorders
are
raised
we
find
by
that
means
from
the
slightest
and
most
frivolous
occasions
solon
was
no
very
cruel
though
perhaps
an
unjust
legislator
who
punished
neuters
in
civil
wars
and
few
i
believe
would
in
such
cases
incur
the
penalty
were
their
affection
and
discourse
allowed
sufficient
to
absolve
them
no
selfishness
and
scarce
any
philosophy
have
there
force
sufficient
to
support
a
total
coolness
and
indifference
and
he
must
be
more
or
less
than
man
who
kindles
not
in
the
common
blaze
what
wonder
then
that
moral
sentiments
are
found
of
such
influence
in
life
though
springing
from
principles
which
may
appear
at
first
sight
somewhat
small
and
delicate
but
these
principles
we
must
remark
are
social
and
universal
they
form
in
a
manner
the
party
of
humankind
against
vice
or
disorder
its
common
enemy
and
as
the
benevolent
concern
for
others
is
diffused
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
over
all
men
and
is
the
same
in
all
it
occurs
more
frequently
in
discourse
is
cherished
by
society
and
conversation
and
the
blame
and
approbation
consequent
on
it
are
thereby
roused
from
that
lethargy
into
which
they
are
probably
lulled
in
solitary
and
uncultivated
nature
other
passions
though
perhaps
originally
stronger
yet
being
selfish
and
private
are
often
overpowered
by
its
force
and
yield
the
dominion
of
our
breast
to
those
social
and
public
principles
another
spring
of
our
constitution
that
brings
a
great
addition
of
force
to
moral
sentiments
is
the
love
of
fame
which
rules
with
such
uncontrolled
authority
in
all
generous
minds
and
is
often
the
grand
object
of
all
their
designs
and
undertakings
by
our
continual
and
earnest
pursuit
of
a
character
a
name
a
reputation
in
the
world
we
bring
our
own
deportment
and
conduct
frequently
in
review
and
consider
how
they
appear
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
approach
and
regard
us
this
constant
habit
of
surveying
ourselves
as
it
were
in
reflection
keeps
alive
all
the
sentiments
of
right
and
wrong
and
begets
in
noble
natures
a
certain
reverence
for
themselves
as
well
as
others
which
is
the
surest
guardian
of
every
virtue
the
animal
conveniencies
and
pleasures
sink
gradually
in
their
value
while
every
inward
beauty
and
moral
grace
is
studiously
acquired
and
the
mind
is
accomplished
in
every
perfection
which
can
adorn
or
embellish
a
rational
creature
here
is
the
most
perfect
morality
with
which
we
are
acquainted
here
is
displayed
the
force
of
many
sympathies
our
moral
sentiment
is
itself
a
feeling
chiefly
of
that
nature
and
our
regard
to
a
character
with
others
seems
to
arise
only
from
a
care
of
preserving
a
character
with
ourselves
and
in
order
to
attain
this
end
we
find
it
necessary
to
prop
our
tottering
judgement
on
the
correspondent
approbation
of
mankind
but
that
we
may
accommodate
matters
and
remove
if
possible
every
difficulty
let
us
allow
all
these
reasonings
to
be
false
let
us
allow
that
when
we
resolve
the
pleasure
which
arises
from
views
of
utility
into
the
sentiments
of
humanity
and
sympathy
we
have
embraced
a
wrong
hypothesis
let
us
confess
it
necessary
to
find
some
other
explication
of
that
applause
which
is
paid
to
objects
whether
inanimate
animate
or
rational
if
they
have
a
tendency
to
promote
the
welfare
and
advantage
of
mankind
however
difficult
it
be
to
conceive
that
an
object
is
approved
of
on
account
of
its
tendency
to
a
certain
end
while
the
end
itself
is
totally
indifferent
let
us
swallow
this
absurdity
and
consider
what
are
the
consequences
the
preceding
delineation
or
definition
of
personal
merit
must
still
retain
its
evidence
and
authority
it
must
still
be
allowed
that
every
quality
of
the
mind
which
is
useful
or
agreeable
to
the
person
himself
or
to
others
communicates
a
pleasure
to
the
spectator
engages
his
esteem
and
is
admitted
under
the
honourable
denomination
of
virtue
or
merit
are
not
justice
fidelity
honour
veracity
allegiance
chastity
esteemed
solely
on
account
of
their
tendency
to
promote
the
good
of
society
is
not
that
tendency
inseparable
from
humanity
benevolence
lenity
generosity
gratitude
moderation
tenderness
friendship
and
all
the
other
social
virtues
can
it
possibly
be
doubted
that
industry
discretion
frugality
secrecy
order
perseverance
forethought
judgement
and
this
whole
class
of
virtues
and
accomplishments
of
which
many
pages
would
not
contain
the
catalogue
can
it
be
doubted
i
say
that
the
tendency
of
these
qualities
to
promote
the
interest
and
happiness
of
their
possessor
is
the
sole
foundation
of
their
merit
who
can
dispute
that
a
mind
which
supports
a
perpetual
serenity
and
cheerfulness
a
noble
dignity
and
undaunted
spirit
a
tender
affection
and
to
all
around
as
it
has
more
enjoyment
within
itself
is
also
a
more
animating
and
rejoicing
spectacle
than
if
dejected
with
melancholy
tormented
with
anxiety
irritated
with
rage
or
sunk
into
the
most
abject
baseness
and
degeneracy
and
as
to
the
qualities
immediately
agreeable
to
others
they
speak
sufficiently
for
themselves
and
he
must
be
unhappy
indeed
either
in
his
own
temper
or
in
his
situation
and
company
who
has
never
perceived
the
charms
of
a
facetious
wit
or
flowing
affability
of
a
delicate
modesty
or
decent
genteelness
of
address
and
manner
i
am
sensible
that
nothing
can
be
more
unphilosophical
than
to
be
positive
or
dogmatical
on
any
subject
and
that
even
if
excessive
scepticism
could
be
maintained
it
would
not
be
more
destructive
to
all
just
reasoning
and
inquiry
i
am
convinced
that
where
men
are
the
most
sure
and
arrogant
they
are
commonly
the
most
mistaken
and
have
there
given
reins
to
passion
without
that
proper
deliberation
and
suspense
which
can
alone
secure
them
from
the
grossest
absurdities
yet
i
must
confess
that
this
enumeration
puts
the
matter
in
so
strong
a
light
that
i
can
not
at
present
be
more
assured
of
any
truth
which
i
learn
from
reasoning
and
argument
than
that
personal
merit
consists
entirely
in
the
usefulness
or
agreeableness
of
qualities
to
the
person
himself
possessed
of
them
or
to
others
who
have
any
intercourse
with
him
but
when
i
reflect
that
though
the
bulk
and
figure
of
the
earth
have
been
measured
and
delineated
though
the
motions
of
the
tides
have
been
accounted
for
the
order
and
economy
of
the
heavenly
bodies
subjected
to
their
proper
laws
and
infinite
itself
reduced
to
calculation
yet
men
still
dispute
concerning
the
foundation
of
their
moral
duties
when
i
reflect
on
this
i
say
i
fall
back
into
diffidence
and
scepticism
and
suspect
that
an
hypothesis
so
obvious
had
it
been
a
true
one
would
long
ere
now
have
been
received
by
the
unanimous
suffrage
and
consent
of
mankind
part
ii
having
explained
the
moral
approbation
attending
merit
or
virtue
there
remains
nothing
but
briefly
to
consider
our
interested
obligation
to
it
and
to
inquire
whether
every
man
who
has
any
regard
to
his
own
happiness
and
welfare
will
not
best
find
his
account
in
the
practice
of
every
moral
duty
if
this
can
be
clearly
ascertained
from
the
foregoing
theory
we
shall
have
the
satisfaction
to
reflect
that
we
have
advanced
principles
which
not
only
it
is
hoped
will
stand
the
test
of
reasoning
and
inquiry
but
may
contribute
to
the
amendment
of
lives
and
their
improvement
in
morality
and
social
virtue
and
though
the
philosophical
truth
of
any
proposition
by
no
means
depends
on
its
tendency
to
promote
the
interests
of
society
yet
a
man
has
but
a
bad
grace
who
delivers
a
theory
however
true
which
he
must
confess
leads
to
a
practice
dangerous
and
pernicious
why
rake
into
those
corners
of
nature
which
spread
a
nuisance
all
around
why
dig
up
the
pestilence
from
the
pit
in
which
it
is
buried
the
ingenuity
of
your
researches
may
be
admired
but
your
systems
will
be
detested
and
mankind
will
agree
if
they
can
not
refute
them
to
sink
them
at
least
in
eternal
silence
and
oblivion
truths
which
are
pernicious
to
society
if
any
such
there
be
will
yield
to
errors
which
are
salutary
and
advantageous
but
what
philosophical
truths
can
be
more
advantageous
to
society
than
those
here
delivered
which
represent
virtue
in
all
her
genuine
and
most
engaging
charms
and
makes
us
approach
her
with
ease
familiarity
and
affection
the
dismal
dress
falls
off
with
which
many
divines
and
some
philosophers
have
covered
her
and
nothing
appears
but
gentleness
humanity
beneficence
affability
nay
even
at
proper
intervals
play
frolic
and
gaiety
she
talks
not
of
useless
austerities
and
rigours
suffering
and
she
declares
that
her
sole
purpose
is
to
make
her
votaries
and
all
mankind
during
every
instant
of
their
existence
if
possible
cheerful
and
happy
nor
does
she
ever
willingly
part
with
any
pleasure
but
in
hopes
of
ample
compensation
in
some
other
period
of
their
lives
the
sole
trouble
which
she
demands
is
that
of
just
calculation
and
a
steady
preference
of
the
greater
happiness
and
if
any
austere
pretenders
approach
her
enemies
to
joy
and
pleasure
she
either
rejects
them
as
hypocrites
and
deceivers
or
if
she
admit
them
in
her
train
they
are
ranked
however
among
the
least
favoured
of
her
votaries
and
indeed
to
drop
all
figurative
expression
what
hopes
can
we
ever
have
of
engaging
mankind
to
a
practice
which
we
confess
full
of
austerity
and
rigour
or
what
theory
of
morals
can
ever
serve
any
useful
purpose
unless
it
can
show
by
a
particular
detail
that
all
the
duties
which
it
recommends
are
also
the
true
interest
of
each
individual
the
peculiar
advantage
of
the
foregoing
system
seems
to
be
that
it
furnishes
proper
mediums
for
that
purpose
that
the
virtues
which
are
immediately
useful
or
agreeable
to
the
person
possessed
of
them
are
desirable
in
a
view
to
it
would
surely
be
superfluous
to
prove
moralists
indeed
may
spare
themselves
all
the
pains
which
they
often
take
in
recommending
these
duties
to
what
purpose
collect
arguments
to
evince
that
temperance
is
advantageous
and
the
excesses
of
pleasure
hurtful
when
it
appears
that
these
excesses
are
only
denominated
such
because
they
are
hurtful
and
that
if
the
unlimited
use
of
strong
liquors
for
instance
no
more
impaired
health
or
the
faculties
of
mind
and
body
than
the
use
of
air
or
water
it
would
not
be
a
whit
more
vicious
or
blameable
it
seems
equally
superfluous
to
prove
that
the
companionable
virtues
of
good
manners
and
wit
decency
and
genteelness
are
more
desirable
than
the
contrary
qualities
vanity
alone
without
any
other
consideration
is
a
sufficient
motive
to
make
us
wish
for
the
possession
of
these
accomplishments
no
man
was
ever
willingly
deficient
in
this
particular
all
our
failures
here
proceed
from
bad
education
want
of
capacity
or
a
perverse
and
unpliable
disposition
would
you
have
your
company
coveted
admired
followed
rather
than
hated
despised
avoided
can
any
one
seriously
deliberate
in
the
case
as
no
enjoyment
is
sincere
without
some
reference
to
company
and
society
so
no
society
can
be
agreeable
or
even
tolerable
where
a
man
feels
his
presence
unwelcome
and
discovers
all
around
him
symptoms
of
disgust
and
aversion
but
why
in
the
greater
society
or
confederacy
of
mankind
should
not
the
case
be
the
same
as
in
particular
clubs
and
companies
why
is
it
more
doubtful
that
the
enlarged
virtues
of
humanity
generosity
beneficence
are
desirable
with
a
view
of
happiness
and
than
the
limited
endowments
of
ingenuity
and
politeness
are
we
apprehensive
lest
those
social
affections
interfere
in
a
greater
and
more
immediate
degree
than
any
other
pursuits
with
private
utility
and
can
not
be
gratified
without
some
important
sacrifice
of
honour
and
advantage
if
so
we
are
but
in
the
nature
of
the
human
passions
and
are
more
influenced
by
verbal
distinctions
than
by
real
differences
whatever
contradiction
may
vulgarly
be
supposed
between
the
selfish
and
social
sentiments
or
dispositions
they
are
really
no
more
opposite
than
selfish
and
ambitious
selfish
and
revengeful
selfish
and
vain
it
is
requisite
that
there
be
an
original
propensity
of
some
kind
in
order
to
be
a
basis
to
by
giving
a
relish
to
the
objects
of
its
pursuit
and
none
more
fit
for
this
purpose
than
benevolence
or
humanity
the
goods
of
fortune
are
spent
in
one
gratification
or
another
the
miser
who
accumulates
his
annual
income
and
lends
it
out
at
interest
has
really
spent
it
in
the
gratification
of
his
avarice
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
show
why
a
man
is
more
a
loser
by
a
generous
action
than
by
any
other
method
of
expense
since
the
utmost
which
he
can
attain
by
the
most
elaborate
selfishness
is
the
indulgence
of
some
affection
now
if
life
without
passion
must
be
altogether
insipid
and
tiresome
let
a
man
suppose
that
he
has
full
power
of
modelling
his
own
disposition
and
let
him
deliberate
what
appetite
or
desire
he
would
choose
for
the
foundation
of
his
happiness
and
enjoyment
every
affection
he
would
observe
when
gratified
by
success
gives
a
satisfaction
proportioned
to
its
force
and
violence
but
besides
this
advantage
common
to
all
the
immediate
feeling
of
benevolence
and
friendship
humanity
and
kindness
is
sweet
smooth
tender
and
agreeable
independent
of
all
fortune
and
accidents
these
virtues
are
besides
attended
with
a
pleasing
consciousness
or
remembrance
and
keep
us
in
humour
with
ourselves
as
well
as
others
while
we
retain
the
agreeable
reflection
of
having
done
our
part
towards
mankind
and
society
and
though
all
men
show
a
jealousy
of
our
success
in
the
pursuits
of
avarice
and
ambition
yet
are
we
almost
sure
of
their
and
good
wishes
so
long
as
we
persevere
in
the
paths
of
virtue
and
employ
ourselves
in
the
execution
of
generous
plans
and
purposes
what
other
passion
is
there
where
we
shall
find
so
many
advantages
united
an
agreeable
sentiment
a
pleasing
consciousness
a
good
reputation
but
of
these
truths
we
may
observe
men
are
of
themselves
pretty
much
convinced
nor
are
they
deficient
in
their
duty
to
society
because
they
would
not
wish
to
be
generous
friendly
and
humane
but
because
they
do
not
feel
themselves
such
treating
vice
with
the
greatest
candour
and
making
it
all
possible
concessions
we
must
acknowledge
that
there
is
not
in
any
instance
the
smallest
pretext
for
giving
it
the
preference
above
virtue
with
a
view
of
except
perhaps
in
the
case
of
justice
where
a
man
taking
things
in
a
certain
light
may
often
seem
to
be
a
loser
by
his
integrity
and
though
it
is
allowed
that
without
a
regard
to
property
no
society
could
subsist
yet
according
to
the
imperfect
way
in
which
human
affairs
are
conducted
a
sensible
knave
in
particular
incidents
may
think
that
an
act
of
iniquity
or
infidelity
will
make
a
considerable
addition
to
his
fortune
without
causing
any
considerable
breach
in
the
social
union
and
confederacy
that
honesty
is
the
best
policy
may
be
a
good
general
rule
but
is
liable
to
many
exceptions
and
he
it
may
perhaps
be
thought
conducts
himself
with
most
wisdom
who
observes
the
general
rule
and
takes
advantage
of
all
the
exceptions
i
must
confess
that
if
a
man
think
that
this
reasoning
much
requires
an
answer
it
would
be
a
little
difficult
to
find
any
which
will
to
him
appear
satisfactory
and
convincing
if
his
heart
rebel
not
against
such
pernicious
maxims
if
he
feel
no
reluctance
to
the
thoughts
of
villainy
or
baseness
he
has
indeed
lost
a
considerable
motive
to
virtue
and
we
may
expect
that
this
practice
will
be
answerable
to
his
speculation
but
in
all
ingenuous
natures
the
antipathy
to
treachery
and
roguery
is
too
strong
to
be
by
any
views
of
profit
or
pecuniary
advantage
inward
peace
of
mind
consciousness
of
integrity
a
satisfactory
review
of
our
own
conduct
these
are
circumstances
very
requisite
to
happiness
and
will
be
cherished
and
cultivated
by
every
honest
man
who
feels
the
importance
of
them
such
a
one
has
besides
the
frequent
satisfaction
of
seeing
knaves
with
all
their
pretended
cunning
and
abilities
betrayed
by
their
own
maxims
and
while
they
purpose
to
cheat
with
moderation
and
secrecy
a
tempting
incident
occurs
nature
is
frail
and
they
give
into
the
snare
whence
they
can
never
extricate
themselves
without
a
total
loss
of
reputation
and
the
forfeiture
of
all
future
trust
and
confidence
with
mankind
but
were
they
ever
so
secret
and
successful
the
honest
man
if
he
has
any
tincture
of
philosophy
or
even
common
observation
and
reflection
will
discover
that
they
themselves
are
in
the
end
the
greatest
dupes
and
have
sacrificed
the
invaluable
enjoyment
of
a
character
with
themselves
at
least
for
the
acquisition
of
worthless
toys
and
gewgaws
how
little
is
requisite
to
supply
the
necessities
of
nature
and
in
a
view
to
pleasure
what
comparison
between
the
unbought
satisfaction
of
conversation
society
study
even
health
and
the
common
beauties
of
nature
but
above
all
the
peaceful
reflection
on
one
own
conduct
what
comparison
i
say
between
these
and
the
feverish
empty
amusements
of
luxury
and
expense
these
natural
pleasures
indeed
are
really
without
price
both
because
they
are
below
all
price
in
their
attainment
and
above
it
in
their
enjoyment
appendix
i
concerning
moral
sentiment
if
the
foregoing
hypothesis
be
received
it
will
now
be
easy
for
us
to
determine
the
question
first
started
footnote
sect
concerning
the
general
principles
of
morals
and
though
we
postponed
the
decision
of
that
question
lest
it
should
then
involve
us
in
intricate
speculations
which
are
unfit
for
moral
discourses
we
may
resume
it
at
present
and
examine
how
far
either
reason
or
sentiment
enters
into
all
decisions
of
praise
or
censure
one
principal
foundation
of
moral
praise
being
supposed
to
lie
in
the
usefulness
of
any
quality
or
action
it
is
evident
that
reason
must
enter
for
a
considerable
share
in
all
decisions
of
this
kind
since
nothing
but
that
faculty
can
instruct
us
in
the
tendency
of
qualities
and
actions
and
point
out
their
beneficial
consequences
to
society
and
to
their
possessor
in
many
cases
this
is
an
affair
liable
to
great
controversy
doubts
may
arise
opposite
interests
may
occur
and
a
preference
must
be
given
to
one
side
from
very
nice
views
and
a
small
overbalance
of
utility
this
is
particularly
remarkable
in
questions
with
regard
to
justice
as
is
indeed
natural
to
suppose
from
that
species
of
utility
which
attends
this
virtue
footnote
see
app
were
every
single
instance
of
justice
like
that
of
benevolence
useful
to
society
this
would
be
a
more
simple
state
of
the
case
and
seldom
liable
to
great
controversy
but
as
single
instances
of
justice
are
often
pernicious
in
their
first
and
immediate
tendency
and
as
the
advantage
to
society
results
only
from
the
observance
of
the
general
rule
and
from
the
concurrence
and
combination
of
several
persons
in
the
same
equitable
conduct
the
case
here
becomes
more
intricate
and
involved
the
various
circumstances
of
society
the
various
consequences
of
any
practice
the
various
interests
which
may
be
proposed
these
on
many
occasions
are
doubtful
and
subject
to
great
discussion
and
inquiry
the
object
of
municipal
laws
is
to
fix
all
the
questions
with
regard
to
justice
the
debates
of
civilians
the
reflections
of
politicians
the
precedents
of
history
and
public
records
are
all
directed
to
the
same
purpose
and
a
very
accurate
reason
or
judgement
is
often
requisite
to
give
the
true
determination
amidst
such
intricate
doubts
arising
from
obscure
or
opposite
utilities
but
though
reason
when
fully
assisted
and
improved
be
sufficient
to
instruct
us
in
the
pernicious
or
useful
tendency
of
qualities
and
actions
it
is
not
alone
sufficient
to
produce
any
moral
blame
or
approbation
utility
is
only
a
tendency
to
a
certain
end
and
were
the
end
totally
indifferent
to
us
we
should
feel
the
same
indifference
towards
the
means
it
is
requisite
a
sentiment
should
here
display
itself
in
order
to
give
a
preference
to
the
useful
above
the
pernicious
tendencies
this
sentiment
can
be
no
other
than
a
feeling
for
the
happiness
of
mankind
and
a
resentment
of
their
misery
since
these
are
the
different
ends
which
virtue
and
vice
have
a
tendency
to
promote
here
therefore
reason
instructs
us
in
the
several
tendencies
of
actions
and
humanity
makes
a
distinction
in
favour
of
those
which
are
useful
and
beneficial
this
partition
between
the
faculties
of
understanding
and
sentiment
in
all
moral
decisions
seems
clear
from
the
preceding
hypothesis
but
i
shall
suppose
that
hypothesis
false
it
will
then
be
requisite
to
look
out
for
some
other
theory
that
may
be
satisfactory
and
i
dare
venture
to
affirm
that
none
such
will
ever
be
found
so
long
as
we
suppose
reason
to
be
the
sole
source
of
morals
to
prove
this
it
will
be
proper
t
o
weigh
the
five
following
considerations
i
it
is
easy
for
a
false
hypothesis
to
maintain
some
appearance
of
truth
while
it
keeps
wholly
in
generals
makes
use
of
undefined
terms
and
employs
comparisons
instead
of
instances
this
is
particularly
remarkable
in
that
philosophy
which
ascribes
the
discernment
of
all
moral
distinctions
to
reason
alone
without
the
concurrence
of
sentiment
it
is
impossible
that
in
any
particular
instance
this
hypothesis
can
so
much
as
be
rendered
intelligible
whatever
specious
figure
it
may
make
in
general
declamations
and
discourses
examine
the
crime
of
ingratitude
for
instance
which
has
place
wherever
we
observe
expressed
and
known
together
with
performed
on
the
one
side
and
a
return
of
or
indifference
with
or
neglect
on
the
other
anatomize
all
these
circumstances
and
examine
by
your
reason
alone
in
what
consists
the
demerit
or
blame
you
never
will
come
to
any
issue
or
conclusion
reason
judges
either
of
matter
of
fact
or
of
relations
enquire
then
first
where
is
that
matter
of
fact
which
we
here
call
crime
point
it
out
determine
the
time
of
its
existence
describe
its
essence
or
nature
explain
the
sense
or
faculty
to
which
it
discovers
itself
it
resides
in
the
mind
of
the
person
who
is
ungrateful
he
must
therefore
feel
it
and
be
conscious
of
it
but
nothing
is
there
except
the
passion
of
or
absolute
indifference
you
can
not
say
that
these
of
themselves
always
and
in
all
circumstances
are
crimes
no
they
are
only
crimes
when
directed
towards
persons
who
have
before
expressed
and
displayed
towards
us
consequently
we
may
infer
that
the
crime
of
ingratitude
is
not
any
particular
individual
fact
but
arises
from
a
complication
of
circumstances
which
being
presented
to
the
spectator
excites
the
sentiment
of
blame
by
the
particular
structure
and
fabric
of
his
mind
this
representation
you
say
is
false
crime
indeed
consists
not
in
a
particular
fact
of
whose
reality
we
are
assured
by
reason
but
it
consists
in
certain
moral
relations
discovered
by
reason
in
the
same
manner
as
we
discover
by
reason
the
truths
of
geometry
or
algebra
but
what
are
the
relations
i
ask
of
which
you
here
talk
in
the
case
stated
above
i
see
first
and
in
one
person
then
and
in
the
other
between
these
there
is
a
relation
of
contariety
does
the
crime
consist
in
that
relation
but
suppose
a
person
bore
me
or
did
me
and
i
in
return
were
indifferent
towards
him
or
did
him
good
offices
here
is
the
same
relation
of
contrariety
and
yet
my
conduct
is
often
highly
laudable
twist
and
turn
this
matter
as
much
as
you
will
you
can
never
rest
the
morality
on
relation
but
must
have
recourse
to
the
decisions
of
sentiment
when
it
is
affirmed
that
two
and
three
are
equal
to
the
half
of
ten
this
relation
of
equality
i
understand
perfectly
i
conceive
that
if
ten
be
divided
into
two
parts
of
which
one
has
as
many
units
as
the
other
and
if
any
of
these
parts
be
compared
to
two
added
to
three
it
will
contain
as
many
units
as
that
compound
number
but
when
you
draw
thence
a
comparison
to
moral
relations
i
own
that
i
am
altogether
at
a
loss
to
understand
you
a
moral
action
a
crime
such
as
ingratitude
is
a
complicated
object
does
the
morality
consist
in
the
relation
of
its
parts
to
each
other
how
after
what
manner
specify
the
relation
be
more
particular
and
explicit
in
your
propositions
and
you
will
easily
see
their
falsehood
no
say
you
the
morality
consists
in
the
relation
of
actions
to
the
rule
of
right
and
they
are
denominated
good
or
ill
according
as
they
agree
or
disagree
with
it
what
then
is
this
rule
of
right
in
what
does
it
consist
how
is
it
determined
by
reason
you
say
which
examines
the
moral
relations
of
actions
so
that
moral
relations
are
determined
by
the
comparison
of
action
to
a
rule
and
that
rule
is
determined
by
considering
the
moral
relations
of
objects
is
not
this
fine
reasoning
all
this
is
metaphysics
you
cry
that
is
enough
there
needs
nothing
more
to
give
a
strong
presumption
of
falsehood
yes
reply
i
here
are
metaphysics
surely
but
they
are
all
on
your
side
who
advance
an
abstruse
hypothesis
which
can
never
be
made
intelligible
nor
quadrate
with
any
particular
instance
or
illustration
the
hypothesis
which
we
embrace
is
plain
it
maintains
that
morality
is
determined
by
sentiment
it
defines
virtue
to
be
whatever
mental
action
or
quality
gives
to
a
spectator
the
pleasing
sentiment
of
approbation
and
vice
the
contrary
we
then
proceed
to
examine
a
plain
matter
of
fact
to
wit
what
actions
have
this
influence
we
consider
all
the
circumstances
in
which
these
actions
agree
and
thence
endeavour
to
extract
some
general
observations
with
regard
to
these
sentiments
if
you
call
this
metaphysics
and
find
anything
abstruse
here
you
need
only
conclude
that
your
turn
of
mind
is
not
suited
to
the
moral
sciences
ii
when
a
man
at
any
time
deliberates
concerning
his
own
conduct
as
whether
he
had
better
in
a
particular
emergence
assist
a
brother
or
a
benefactor
he
must
consider
these
separate
relations
with
all
the
circumstances
and
situations
of
the
persons
in
order
to
determine
the
superior
duty
and
obligation
and
in
order
to
determine
the
proportion
of
lines
in
any
triangle
it
is
necessary
to
examine
the
nature
of
that
figure
and
the
relation
which
its
several
parts
bear
to
each
other
but
notwithstanding
this
appearing
similarity
in
the
two
cases
there
is
at
bottom
an
extreme
difference
between
them
a
speculative
reasoner
concerning
triangles
or
circles
considers
the
several
known
and
given
relations
of
the
parts
of
these
figures
and
thence
infers
some
unknown
relation
which
is
dependent
on
the
former
but
in
moral
deliberations
we
must
be
acquainted
beforehand
with
all
the
objects
and
all
their
relations
to
each
other
and
from
a
comparison
of
the
whole
fix
our
choice
or
approbation
no
new
fact
to
be
ascertained
no
new
relation
to
be
discovered
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
are
supposed
to
be
laid
before
us
ere
we
can
fix
any
sentence
of
blame
or
approbation
if
any
material
circumstance
be
yet
unknown
or
doubtful
we
must
first
employ
our
inquiry
or
intellectual
faculties
to
assure
us
of
it
and
must
suspend
for
a
time
all
moral
decision
or
sentiment
while
we
are
ignorant
whether
a
man
were
aggressor
or
not
how
can
we
determine
whether
the
person
who
killed
him
be
criminal
or
innocent
but
after
every
circumstance
every
relation
is
known
the
understanding
has
no
further
room
to
operate
nor
any
object
on
which
it
could
employ
itself
the
approbation
or
blame
which
then
ensues
can
not
be
the
work
of
the
judgement
but
of
the
heart
and
is
not
a
speculative
proposition
or
affirmation
but
an
active
feeling
or
sentiment
in
the
disquisitions
of
the
understanding
from
known
circumstances
and
relations
we
infer
some
new
and
unknown
in
moral
decisions
all
the
circumstances
and
relations
must
be
previously
known
and
the
mind
from
the
contemplation
of
the
whole
feels
some
new
impression
of
affection
or
disgust
esteem
or
contempt
approbation
or
blame
hence
the
great
difference
between
a
mistake
of
fact
and
one
of
right
and
hence
the
reason
why
the
one
is
commonly
criminal
and
not
the
other
when
oedipus
killed
laius
he
was
ignorant
of
the
relation
and

all
the

between

and
all
the

of
the

were
previously
known

but
the
motive

prevailed
in

over
the

and
when

himself
in

little

became

it
is
not
that

see
any
relations

that
for
the
rectitude
of
our
disposition
we
feel
sentiments
against
which

a
long
perseverance
in
the
most
enormous

in
these

then
not
in
a

of

kind

all
moral

form
any
decision
of
this

must
be
known

ascertained
on
the
side
of
the
object

action
nothing
remains
but
to
feel
on
our
part
some
sentiment
of
blame
or
approbation
whence
we
pronounce
the
action
criminal
or
virtuous
iii
this
doctrine
will
become
still
more
evident
if
we
compare
moral
beauty
with
natural
to
which
in
many
particulars
it
bears
so
near
a
resemblance
it
is
on
the
proportion
relation
and
position
of
parts
that
all
natural
beauty
depends
but
it
would
be
absurd
thence
to
infer
that
the
perception
of
beauty
like
that
of
truth
in
geometrical
problems
consists
wholly
in
the
perception
of
relations
and
was
performed
entirely
by
the
understanding
or
intellectual
faculties
in
all
the
sciences
our
mind
from
the
known
relations
investigates
the
unknown
but
in
all
decisions
of
taste
or
external
beauty
all
the
relations
are
beforehand
obvious
to
the
eye
and
we
thence
proceed
to
feel
a
sentiment
of
complacency
or
disgust
according
to
the
nature
of
the
object
and
disposition
of
our
organs

explained

the
qualities
of

circle
but
has

said
a

reason
is

the

is
not
a

it
lies
not
in
any
part
of
the
line
whose
parts
are
equally
distant
from

common
centre
it
is
only
the
effect
which
that
figure
produces
upon
the
mind
whose
peculiar
fabric
of
structure
renders
it
susceptible
of
such
sentiments
in
vain
would
you
look
for
it
in
the
circle
or
seek
it
either
by
your
senses
or
by
mathematical
reasoning
in
all
the
properties
of
that
figure

to
palladio
and
perrault
while
they
explain
all
the
parts
and
proportions
of
a
pillar
they
talk
of
the
cornice
and
frieze
and
base
and
entablature
and
shaft
and
architrave
and
give
the
description
and
position
of
each
of
these
members
but
should
you
ask
the
description
and
position
of
its
beauty
they
would
readily
reply
that
the
beauty
is
not
in
any
of
the
parts
or
members
of
a
pillar
but
results
from
the
whole
when
that
complicated
figure
is
presented
to
an
intelligent
mind
susceptible
to
those
finer
sensations
till
such
a
spectator
appear
there
is
nothing
but
a
figure
of
such
particular
dimensions
and
proportions
from
his
sentiments
alone
arise
its
elegance
and
beauty
again
attend
to
cicero
while
he
paints
the
crimes
of
a
verres
or
a
catiline
you
must
acknowledge
that
the
moral
turpitude
results
in
the
same
manner
from
the
contemplation
of
the
whole
when
presented
to
a
being
whose
organs
have
such
a
particular
structure
and
formation
the
orator
may
paint
rage
insolence
barbarity
on
the
one
side
meekness
suffering
sorrow
innocence
on
the
other
but
if
you
feel
no
indignation
or
compassion
arise
in
you
from
this
complication
of
circumstances
you
would
in
vain
ask
him
in
what
consists
the
crime
or
villainy
which
he
so
vehemently
exclaims
against
at
what
time
or
on
what
subject
it
first
began
to
exist
and
what
has
a
few
months
afterwards
become
of
it
when
every
disposition
and
thought
of
all
the
actors
is
totally
altered
or
annihilated
no
satisfactory
answer
can
be
given
to
any
of
these
questions
upon
the
abstract
hypothesis
of
morals
and
we
must
at
last
acknowledge
that
the
crime
or
immorality
is
no
particular
fact
or
relation
which
can
be
the
object
of
the
understanding
but
arises
entirely
from
the
sentiment
of
disapprobation
which
by
the
structure
of
human
nature
we
unavoidably
feel
on
the
apprehension
of
barbarity
or
treachery
iv
inanimate
objects
may
bear
to
each
other
all
the
same
relations
which
we
observe
in
moral
agents
though
the
former
can
never
be
the
object
of
love
or
hatred
nor
are
consequently
susceptible
of
merit
or
iniquity
a
young
tree
which
and
destroys
its
parent
stands
in
all
the
same
relations
with
nero
when
he
murdered
agrippina
and
if
morality
consisted
merely
in
relations
would
no
doubt
be
equally
criminal
it
appears
evident
that
the
ultimate
ends
of
human
actions
can
never
in
any
case
be
accounted
for
by
reason
but
recommend
themselves
entirely
to
the
sentiments
and
affections
of
mankind
without
any
dependance
on
the
intellectual
faculties
ask
a
man
why
he
uses
exercise
he
will
answer
because
he
desires
to
keep
his
health
if
you
then
enquire
why
he
desires
health
he
will
readily
reply
because
sickness
is
painful
if
you
push
your
enquiries
farther
and
desire
a
reason
why
he
hates
pain
it
is
impossible
he
can
ever
give
any
this
is
an
ultimate
end
and
is
never
referred
to
any
other
object
perhaps
to
your
second
question
why
he
desires
health
he
may
also
reply
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
exercise
of
his
calling
if
you
ask
why
he
is
anxious
on
that
head
he
will
answer
because
he
desires
to
get
money
if
you
demand
why
it
is
the
instrument
of
pleasure
says
he
and
beyond
this
it
is
an
absurdity
to
ask
for
a
reason
it
is
impossible
there
can
be
a
progress
in
infinitum
and
that
one
thing
can
always
be
a
reason
why
another
is
desired
something
must
be
desirable
on
its
own
account
and
because
of
its
immediate
accord
or
agreement
with
human
sentiment
and
affection
now
as
virtue
is
an
end
and
is
desirable
on
its
own
account
without
fee
and
reward
merely
for
the
immediate
satisfaction
which
it
conveys
it
is
requisite
that
there
should
be
some
sentiment
which
it
touches
some
internal
taste
or
feeling
or
whatever
you
may
please
to
call
it
which
distinguishes
moral
good
and
evil
and
which
embraces
the
one
and
rejects
the
other
thus
the
distinct
boundaries
and
offices
of
reason
and
of
taste
are
easily
ascertained
the
former
conveys
the
knowledge
of
truth
and
falsehood
the
latter
gives
the
sentiment
of
beauty
and
deformity

and
virtue
the
one
discovers
objects
as
they
really
stand
in
nature
without
addition
and
diminution
the
other
has
a
productive
faculty
and
gilding
or
staining
all
natural
objects
with
the
colours
borrowed
from
internal
sentiment
raises
in
a
manner
a
new

reason

is
the
first
spring

to
desire

the

leads
us
to
the
discovery
of
the
concealed
and
unknown
after

laid
before
us

makes
us
feel
from
the

a
new
sentiment
of
blame
or
approbation
the

ii
of
there
is
a
principle
supposed
to
prevail
among
many
which
is
utterly
incompatible
with
all
virtue
or
moral
sentiment
and
as
it
can
proceed
from
nothing
but
the
most
depraved
disposition
so
in
its
turn
it
tends
still
further
to
encourage
that
depravity
this
principle
is
that
all
benevolence
is
mere
hypocrisy
friendship
a
cheat
public
spirit
a
farce
fidelity
a
snare
to
procure
trust
and
confidence
and
that
while
all
of
us
at
bottom
pursue
only
our
private
interest
we
wear
these
fair
disguises
in
order
to
put
others
off
their
guard
and
expose
them
the
more
to
our
wiles
and
machinations
what
heart
one
must
be
possessed
of
who
possesses
such
principles
and
who
feels
no
internal
sentiment
that
belies
so
pernicious
a
theory
it
is
easy
to
imagine
and
also
what
degree
of
affection
and
benevolence
he
can
bear
to
a
species
whom
he
represents
under
such
odious
colours
and
supposes
so
little
susceptible
of
gratitude
or
any
return
of
affection
or
if
we
should
not
ascribe
these
principles
wholly
to
a
corrupted
heart
we
must
at
least
account
for
them
from
the
most
careless
and
precipitate
examination
superficial
reasoners
indeed
observing
many
false
pretences
among
mankind
and
feeling
perhaps
no
very
strong
restraint
in
their
own
disposition
might
draw
a
general
and
a
hasty
conclusion
that
all
is
equally
corrupted
and
that
men
different
from
all
other
animals
and
indeed
from
all
other
species
of
existence
admit
of
no
degrees
of
good
or
bad
but
are
in
every
instance
the
same
creatures
under
different
disguises
and
appearances
there
is
another
principle
somewhat
resembling
the
former
which
has
been
much
insisted
on
by
philosophers
and
has
been
the
foundation
of
many
a
system
that
whatever
affection
one
may
feel
or
imagine
he
feels
for
others
no
passion
is
or
can
be
disinterested
that
the
most
generous
friendship
however
sincere
is
a
modification
of
and
that
even
unknown
to
ourselves
we
seek
only
our
own
gratification
while
we
appear
the
most
deeply
engaged
in
schemes
for
the
liberty
and
happiness
of
mankind
by
a
turn
of
imagination
by
a
refinement
of
reflection
by
an
enthusiasm
of
passion
we
seem
to
take
part
in
the
interests
of
others
and
imagine
ourselves
divested
of
all
selfish
considerations
but
at
bottom
the
most
generous
patriot
and
most
niggardly
miser
the
bravest
hero
and
most
abject
coward
have
in
every
action
an
equal
regard
to
their
own
happiness
and
welfare
whoever
concludes
from
the
seeming
tendency
of
this
opinion
that
those
who
make
profession
of
it
can
not
possibly
feel
the
true
sentiments
of
benevolence
or
have
any
regard
for
genuine
virtue
will
often
find
himself
in
practice
very
much
mistaken
probity
and
honour
were
no
strangers
to
epicurus
and
his
sect
atticus
and
horace
seem
to
have
enjoyed
from
nature
and
cultivated
by
reflection
as
generous
and
friendly
dispositions
as
any
disciple
of
the
austerer
schools
and
among
the
modern
hobbes
and
locke
who
maintained
the
selfish
system
of
morals
lived
irreproachable
lives
though
the
former
lay
not
under
any
restraint
of
religion
which
might
supply
the
defects
of
his
philosophy
an
epicurean
or
a
hobbist
readily
allows
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
friendship
in
the
world
without
hypocrisy
or
disguise
though
he
may
attempt
by
a
philosophical
chymistry
to
resolve
the
elements
of
this
passion
if
i
may
so
speak
into
those
of
another
and
explain
every
affection
to
be
twisted
and
moulded
by
a
particular
turn
of
imagination
into
a
variety
of
appearances
but
as
the
same
turn
of
imagination
prevails
not
in
every
man
nor
gives
the
same
direction
to
the
original
passion
this
is
sufficient
even
according
to
the
selfish
system
to
make
the
widest
difference
in
human
characters
and
denominate
one
man
virtuous
and
humane
another
vicious
and
meanly
interested
i
esteem
the
man
whose
by
whatever
means
is
so
directed
as
to
give
him
a
concern
for
others
and
render
him
serviceable
to
society
as
i
hate
or
despise
him
who
has
no
regard
to
any
thing
beyond
his
own
gratifications
and
enjoyments
in
vain
would
you
suggest
that
these
characters
though
seemingly
opposite
are
at
bottom
the
same
and
that
a
very
inconsiderable
turn
of
thought
forms
the
whole
difference
between
them
each
character
notwithstanding
these
inconsiderable
differences
appears
to
me
in
practice
pretty
durable
and
untransmutable
and
i
find
not
in
this
more
than
in
other
subjects
that
the
natural
sentiments
arising
from
the
general
appearances
of
things
are
easily
destroyed
by
subtile
reflections
concerning
the
minute
origin
of
these
appearances
does
not
the
lively
cheerful
colour
of
a
countenance
inspire
me
with
complacency
and
pleasure
even
though
i
learn
from
philosophy
that
all
difference
of
complexion
arises
from
the
most
minute
differences
of
thickness
in
the
most
minute
parts
of
the
skin
by
means
of
which
a
superficies
is
qualified
to
reflect
one
of
the
original
colours
of
light
and
absorb
the
others
but
though
the
question
concerning
the
universal
or
partial
selfishness
of
man
be
not
so
material
as
is
usually
imagined
to
morality
and
practice
it
is
certainly
of
consequence
in
the
speculative
science
of
human
nature
and
is
a
proper
object
of
curiosity
and
enquiry
it
may
not
therefore
be
unsuitable
in
this
place
to
bestow
a
few
reflections
upon
it
footnote
benevolence
naturally
divides
into
two
kinds
the
general
and
the
particular
the
first
is
where
we
have
no
friendship
or
connexion
or
esteem
for
the
person
but
feel
only
a
general
sympathy
with
him
or
a
compassion
for
his
pains
and
a
congratulation
with
his
pleasures
the
other
species
of
benevolence
is
founded
on
an
opinion
of
virtue
on
services
done
us
or
on
some
particular
connexions
both
these
sentiments
must
be
allowed
real
in
human
nature
but
whether
they
will
resolve
into
some
nice
considerations
of
is
a
question
more
curious
than
important
the
former
sentiment
to
wit
that
of
general
benevolence
or
humanity
or
sympathy
we
shall
have
occasion
frequently
to
treat
of
in
the
course
of
this
inquiry
and
i
assume
it
as
real
from
general
experience
without
any
other
proof
the
most
obvious
objection
to
the
selfish
hypothesis
is
that
as
it
is
contrary
to
common
feeling
and
our
most
unprejudiced
notions
there
is
required
the
highest
stretch
of
philosophy
to
establish
so
extraordinary
a
paradox
to
the
most
careless
observer
there
appear
to
be
such
dispositions
as
benevolence
and
generosity
such
affections
as
love
friendship
compassion
gratitude
these
sentiments
have
their
causes
effects
objects
and
operations
marked
by
common
language
and
observation
and
plainly
distinguished
from
those
of
the
selfish
passions
and
as
this
is
the
obvious
appearance
of
things
it
must
be
admitted
till
some
hypothesis
be
discovered
which
by
penetrating
deeper
into
human
nature
may
prove
the
former
affections
to
be
nothing
but
modifications
of
the
latter
all
attempts
of
this
kind
have
hitherto
proved
fruitless
and
seem
to
have
proceeded
entirely
from
that
love
of
simplicity
which
has
been
the
source
of
much
false
reasoning
in
philosophy
i
shall
not
here
enter
into
any
detail
on
the
present
subject
many
able
philosophers
have
shown
the
insufficiency
of
these
systems
and
i
shall
take
for
granted
what
i
believe
the
smallest
reflection
will
make
evident
to
every
impartial
enquirer
but
the
nature
of
the
subject
furnishes
the
strongest
presumption
that
no
better
system
will
ever
for
the
future
be
invented
in
order
to
account
for
the
origin
of
the
benevolent
from
the
selfish
affections
and
reduce
all
the
various
emotions
of
the
human
mind
to
a
perfect
simplicity
the
case
is
not
the
same
in
this
species
of
philosophy
as
in
physics
many
an
hypothesis
in
nature
contrary
to
first
appearances
has
been
found
on
more
accurate
scrutiny
solid
and
satisfactory
instances
of
this
kind
are
so
frequent
that
a
judicious
as
well
as
witty
philosopher

mons

ventured
to
affirm
if
there

than

way

phenomenon
may
be
produced

there
is
general
presumption
for
its
arising

on

of
the
internal
operations
of
the
human
mind
the
simplest
and
most
obvious
cause
which
can
there
be
assigned
for
any
phenomenon
is
probably
the
true
one
when
a
philosopher
in
the
explication
of
his
system
is
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
some
very
intricate
and
refined
reflections
and
to
suppose
them
essential
to
the
production
of
any
passion
or
emotion
we
have
reason
to
be
extremely
on
our
guard
against
so
fallacious
an
hypothesis
the
affections
are
not
susceptible
of
any
impression
from
the
refinements
of
reason
or
imagination
and
it
is
always
found
that
a
vigorous
exertion
of
the
latter
faculties
necessarily
from
the
narrow
capacity
of
the
human
mind
destroys
all
activity
in
the
former
our
predominant
motive
or
intention
is
indeed
frequently
concealed
from
ourselves
when
it
is
mingled
and
confounded
with
other
motives
which
the
mind
from
vanity
or
is
desirous
of
supposing
more
prevalent
but
there
is
no
instance
that
a
concealment
of
this
nature
has
ever
arisen
from
the
abstruseness
and
intricacy
of
the
motive
a
man
that
has
lost
a
friend
and
patron
may
flatter
himself
that
all
his
grief
arises
from
generous
sentiments
without
any
mixture
of
narrow
or
interested
considerations
but
a
man
that
grieves
for
a
valuable
friend
who
needed
his
patronage
and
protection
how
can
we
suppose
that
his
passionate
tenderness
arises
from
some
metaphysical
regards
to
a
which
has
no
foundation
or
reality
we
may
as
well
imagine
that
minute
wheels
and
springs
like
those
of
a
watch
give
motion
to
a
loaded
waggon
as
account
for
the
origin
of
passion
from
such
abstruse
reflections
animals
are
found
susceptible
of
kindness
both
to
their
own
species
and
to
ours
nor
is
there
in
this
case
the
least
suspicion
of
disguise
or
artifice
shall
we
account
for
all
their
sentiments
too
from
refined
deductions
of
or
if
we
admit
a
disinterested
benevolence
in
the
inferior
species
by
what
rule
of
analogy
can
we
refuse
it
in
the
superior
love
between
the
sexes
begets
a
complacency
and
very
distinct
from
the
gratification
of
an
appetite
tenderness
to
their
offspring
in
all
sensible
beings
is
commonly
able
alone
to
the
strongest
motives
of
and
has
no
manner
of
dependance
on
that
affection
what
interest
can
a
fond
mother
have
in
view
who
loses
her
health
by
assiduous
attendance
on
her
sick
child
and
afterwards
languishes
and
dies
of
grief
when
freed
by
its
death
from
the
slavery
of
that
attendance
is
gratitude
no
affection
of
the
human
breast
or
is
that
a
word
merely
without
any
meaning
or
reality
have
we
no
satisfaction
in
one
company
above
another
and
no
desire
of
the
welfare
of
our
friend
even
though
absence
or
death
should
prevent
us
from
all
participation
in
it
or
what
is
it
commonly
that
gives
us
any
participation
in
it
even
while
alive
and
present
but
our
affection
and
regard
to
him
these
and
a
thousand
other
instances
are
marks
of
a
general
benevolence
in
human
nature
where
no
real
interest
binds
us
to
the
object
and
how
an
imaginary
interest
known
and
avowed
for
such
can
be
the
origin
of
any
passion
or
emotion
seems
difficult
to
explain
no
satisfactory
hypothesis
of
this
kind
has
yet
been
discovered
nor
is
there
the
smallest
probability
that
the
future
industry
of
men
will
ever
be
attended
with
more
favourable
success
but
farther
if
we
consider
rightly
of
the
matter
we
shall
find
that
the
hypothesis
which
allows
of
a
disinterested
benevolence
distinct
from
has
really
more
simplicity
in
it
and
is
more
conformable
to
the
analogy
of
nature
than
that
which
pretends
to
resolve
all
friendship
and
humanity
into
this
latter
principle
there
are
bodily
wants
or
appetites
acknowledged
by
every
one
which
necessarily
precede
all
sensual
enjoyment
and
carry
us
directly
to
seek
possession
of
the
object
thus
hunger
and
thirst
have
eating
and
drinking
for
their
end
and
from
the
gratification
of
these
primary
appetites
arises
a
pleasure
which
may
become
the
object
of
another
species
of
desire
or
inclination
that
is
secondary
and
interested
in
the
same
manner
there
are
mental
passions
by
which
we
are
impelled
immediately
to
seek
particular
objects
such
as
fame
or
power
or
vengeance
without
any
regard
to
interest
and
when
these
objects
are
attained
a
pleasing
enjoyment
ensues
as
the
consequence
of
our
indulged
affections
nature
must
by
the
internal
frame
and
constitution
of
the
mind
give
an
original
propensity
to
fame
ere
we
can
reap
any
pleasure
from
that
acquisition
or
pursue
it
from
motives
of
and
desire
of
happiness
if
i
have
no
vanity
i
take
no
delight
in
praise
if
i
be
void
of
ambition
power
gives
me
no
enjoyment
if
i
be
not
angry
the
punishment
of
an
adversary
is
totally
indifferent
to
me
in
all
these
cases
there
is
a
passion
which
points
immediately
to
the
object
and
constitutes
it
our
good
or
happiness
as
there
are
other
secondary
passions
which
afterwards
arise
and
pursue
it
as
a
part
of
our
happiness
when
once
it
is
constituted
such
by
our
original
affections
were
there
no
appetite
of
any
kind
antecedent
to
that
propensity
could
scarcely
ever
exert
itself
because
we
should
in
that
case
have
felt
few
and
slender
pains
or
pleasures
and
have
little
misery
or
happiness
to
avoid
or
to
pursue
now
where
is
the
difficulty
in
conceiving
that
this
may
likewise
be
the
case
with
benevolence
and
friendship
and
that
from
the
original
frame
of
our
temper
we
may
feel
a
desire
of
another
happiness
or
good
which
by
means
of
that
affection
becomes
our
own
good
and
is
afterwards
pursued
from
the
combined
motives
of
benevolence
and
who
sees
not
that
vengeance
from
the
force
alone
of
passion
may
be
so
eagerly
pursued
as
to
make
us
knowingly
neglect
every
consideration
of
ease
interest
or
safety
and
like
some
vindictive
animals
infuse
our
very
souls
into
the
wounds
we
give
an
enemy

some
farther
considerations
with
regard
to
justice
the
intention
of
this
appendix
is
to
give
some
more
particular
explication
of
the
origin
and
nature
of
justice
and
to
mark
some
differences
between
it
and
the
other
virtues
the
social
virtues
of
humanity
and
benevolence
exert
their
influence
immediately
by
a
direct
tendency
or
instinct
which
chiefly
keeps
in
view
the
simple
object
moving
the
affections
and
comprehends
not
any
scheme
or
system
nor
the
consequences
resulting
from
the
concurrence
imitation
or
example
of
others
a
parent
flies
to
the
relief
of
his
child
transported
by
that
natural
sympathy
which
actuates
him
and
which
affords
no
leisure
to
reflect
on
the
sentiments
or
conduct
of
the
rest
of
mankind
in
like
circumstances
a
generous
man
cheerfully
embraces
an
opportunity
of
serving
his
friend
because
he
then
feels
himself
under
the
dominion
of
the
beneficent
affections
nor
is
he
concerned
whether
any
other
person
in
the
universe
were
ever
before
actuated
by
such
noble
motives
or
will
ever
afterwards
prove
their
influence
in
all
these
cases
the
social
passions
have
in
view
a
single
individual
object
and
pursue
the
safety
or
happiness
alone
of
the
person
loved
and
esteemed
with
this
they
are
satisfied
in
this
they
acquiesce
and
as
the
good
resulting
from
their
benign
influence
is
in
itself
complete
and
entire
it
also
excites
the
moral
sentiment
of
approbation
without
any
reflection
on
farther
consequences
and
without
any
more
enlarged
views
of
the
concurrence
or
imitation
of
the
other
members
of
society
on
the
contrary
were
the
generous
friend
or
disinterested
patriot
to
stand
alone
in
the
practice
of
beneficence
this
would
rather
enhance
his
value
in
our
eyes
and
join
the
praise
of
rarity
and
novelty
to
his
other
more
exalted
merits
the
case
is
not
the
same
with
the
social
virtues
of
justice
and
fidelity
they
are
highly
useful
or
indeed
absolutely
necessary
to
the
of
mankind
but
the
benefit
resulting
from
them
is
not
the
consequence
of
every
individual
single
act
but
arises
from
the
whole
scheme
or
system
concurred
in
by
the
whole
or
the
greater
part
of
the
society
general
peace
and
order
are
the
attendants
of

or
a
general
abstinence
from
the
possessions
of
others
but
a
particular
regard
to
the
particular
right
of
one
individual
citizen
may
frequently
considered
in
itself
be
productive
of
pernicious
consequences
the
result
of
the
individual
acts
is
here
in
many
instances
directly
opposite
to
that
of
the
whole
system
of
actions
and
the
former
may
be
extremely
hurtful

the
latter
is
to
the
highest
degree
advantageous
riches
inherited
from
a
parent
are
in
a
bad
hand
the
instrument
of
mischief
the
right
of
succession
may
in
one
instance
be
hurtful
its
benefit
arises
only
from
the
observance
of
the
general
rule
and
it
is
sufficient
if
compensation
be
thereby
made
for
all
the
ills
and

which

the

subdivisions
may
be
compared
to

of
a
vault

would

itself
fall
to

nor
is
the
whole
fabric
supported
but
by
the
mutual
assistance
and
combination
of
its
corresponding
parts
all
the
laws
of
nature
which
regulate
property
as
well
as
all
civil
laws
are
general
and
regard
alone
some
essential
circumstances
of
the
case
without
taking
into
consideration
the
characters
situations
and
connexions
of
the
person
concerned
or
any
particular
consequences
which
may
result
from
the
determination
of
these
laws
in
any
particular
case
which
offers
they
deprive
without
scruple
a
beneficent
man
of
all
his
possessions
if
acquired
by
mistake
without
a
good
title
in
order
to
bestow
them
on
a
selfish
miser
who
has
already
heaped
up
immense
stores
of
superfluous
riches
public
utility
requires
that
property
should
be
regulated
by
general
inflexible
rules
and
though
such
rules
are
adopted
as
best
serve
the
same
end
of
public
utility
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
prevent
all
particular
hardships
or
make
beneficial
consequences
result
from
every
individual
case
it
is
sufficient
if
the
whole
plan
or
scheme
be
necessary
to
the
support
of
civil
society
and
if
the
balance
of
good
in
the
main
do
thereby
preponderate
much
above
that
of
evil
even
the
general
laws
of
the
universe
though
planned
by
infinite
wisdom
can
not
exclude
all
evil
or
inconvenience
in
every
particular
operation
it
has
been
asserted
by
some
that
justice
arises
from
human
conventions
and
proceeds
from
the
voluntary
choice
consent
or
combination
of
mankind
if
by
convention
be
here
meant
a
promise
which
is
the
most
usual
sense
of
the
word
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
than
this
position
the
observance
of
promises
is
itself
one
of
the
most
considerable
parts
of
justice
and
we
are
not
surely
bound
to
keep
our
word
because
we
have
given
our
word
to
keep
it
but
if
by
convention
be
meant
a
sense
of
common
interest
which
sense
each
man
feels
in
his
own
breast
which
he
remarks
in
his
fellows
and
which
carries
him
in
concurrence
with
others
into
a
general
plan
or
system
of
actions
which
tends
to
public
utility
it
must
be
owned
that
in
this
sense
justice
arises
from
human
conventions
for
if
it
be
allowed
what
is
indeed
evident
that
the
particular
consequences
of
a
particular
act
of
justice
may
be
hurtful
to
the
public
as
well
as
to
individuals
it
follows
that
every
man
in
embracing
that
virtue
must
have
an
eye
to
the
whole
plan
or
system
and
must
expect
the
concurrence
of
his
fellows
in
the
same
conduct
and
behaviour
did
all
his
views
terminate
in
the
consequences
of
each
act
of
his
own
his
benevolence
and
humanity
as
well
as
his
might
often
prescribe
to
him
measures
of
conduct
very
different
from
those
which
are
agreeable
to
the
strict
rules
of
right
and
justice
thus
two
men
pull
the
oars
of
a
boat
by
common
convention
for
common
interest
without
any
promise
or
contract
thus
gold
and
silver
are
made
the
measures
of
exchange
thus
speech
and
words
and
language
are
fixed
by
human
convention
and
agreement
whatever
is
advantageous
to
two
or
more
persons
if
all
perform
their
part
but
what
loses
all
advantage
if
only
one
perform
can
arise
from
no
other
principle
there
would
otherwise
be
no
motive
for
any
one
of
them
to
enter
into
that
scheme
of
conduct

guided
by
instinct
which
supplies
the
place
for
reason
but
all
these
disputes
are
merely
verbal
among
all
civilized
nations
it
has
been
the
constant
endeavour
to
remove
everything
arbitrary
and
partial
from
the
decision
of
property
and
to
fix
the
sentence
of
judges
by
such
general
views
and
considerations
as
may
be
equal
to
every
member
of
society
for
besides
that
nothing
could
be
more
dangerous
than
to
accustom
the
bench
even
in
the
smallest
instance
to
regard
private
friendship
or
enmity
it
is
certain
that
men
where
they
imagine
that
there
was
no
other
reason
for
the
preference
of
their
adversary
but
personal
favour
are
apt
to
entertain
the
strongest
against
the
magistrates
and
judges
when
natural
reason
therefore
points
out
no
fixed
view
of
public
utility
by
which
a
controversy
of
property
can
be
decided
positive
laws
are
often
framed
to
supply
its
place
and
direct
the
procedure
of
all
courts
of
judicature
where
these
too
fail
as
often
happens
precedents
are
called
for
and
a
former
decision
though
given
itself
without
any
sufficient
reason
justly
becomes
a
sufficient
reason
for
a
new
decision
if
direct
laws
and
precedents
be
wanting
imperfect
and
indirect
ones
are
brought
in
aid
and
the
controverted
case
is
ranged
under
them
by
analogical
reasonings
and
comparisons
and
similitudes
and
correspondencies
which
are
often
more
fanciful
than
real
in
general
it
may
safely
be
affirmed
that
jurisprudence
is
in
this
respect
different
from
all
the
sciences
and
that
in
many
of
its
nicer
questions
there
can
not
properly
be
said
to
be
truth
or
falsehood
on
either
side
if
one
pleader
bring
the
case
under
any
former
law
or
precedent
by
a
refined
analogy
or
comparison
the
opposite
pleader
is
not
at
a
loss
to
find
an
opposite
analogy
or
comparison
and
the
preference
given
by
the
judge
is
often
founded
more
on
taste
and
imagination
than
on
any
solid
argument
public
utility
is
the
general
object
of
all
courts
of
judicature
and
this
utility
too
requires
a
stable
rule
in
all
controversies
but
where
several
rules
nearly
equal
and
indifferent
present
themselves
it
is
a
very
slight
turn
of
thought
which
fixes
the
decision
in
favour
of
either
party
footnote
that
there
be
a
separation
or
distinction
of
possessions
and
that
this
separation
be
steady
and
constant
this
is
absolutely
required
by
the
interests
of
society
and
hence
the
origin
of
justice
and
property
what
possessions
are
assigned
to
particular
persons
this
is
generally
speaking
pretty
indifferent
and
is
often
determined
by
very
frivolous
views
and
considerations
we
shall
mention
a
few
particulars
were
a
society
formed
among
several
independent
members
the
most
obvious
rule
which
could
be
agreed
on
would
be
to
annex
property
to
present
possession
and
leave
every
one
a
right
to
what
he
at
present
enjoys
the
relation
of
possession
which
takes
place
between
the
person
and
the
object
naturally
draws
on
the
relation
of
property
for
a
like
reason
occupation
or
first
possession
becomes
the
foundation
of
property
where
a
man
bestows
labour
and
industry
upon
any
object
which
before
belonged
to
no
body
as
in
cutting
down
and
shaping
a
tree
in
cultivating
a
field
the
alterations
which
he
produces
causes
a
relation
between
him
and
the
object
and
naturally
engages
us
to
annex
it
to
him
by
the
new
relation
of
property
this
cause
here
concurs
with
the
public
utility
which
consists
in
the
encouragement
given
to
industry
and
labour
perhaps
too
private
humanity
towards
the
possessor
concurs
in
this
instance
with
the
other
motives
and
engages
us
to
leave
with
him
what
he
has
acquired
by
his
sweat
and
labour
and
what
he
has
flattered
himself
in
the
constant
enjoyment
of
for
though
private
humanity
can
by
no
means
be
the
origin
of
justice
since
the
latter
virtue
so
often
contradicts
the
former
yet
when
the
rule
of
separate
and
constant
possession
is
once
formed
by
the
indispensable
necessities
of
society
private
humanity
and
an
aversion
to
the
doing
a
hardship
to
another
may
in
a
particular
instance
give
rise
to
a
particular
rule
of
property
i
am
much
inclined
to
think
that
the
right
succession
or
inheritance
much
depends
on
those
connexions
of
the
imagination
and
that
the
relation
to
a
former
proprietor
begetting
a
relation
to
the
object
is
the
cause
why
the
property
is
transferred
to
a
man
after
the
death
of
his
kinsman
it
is
true
industry
is
more
encouraged
by
the
transference
of
possession
to
children
or
near
relations
but
this
consideration
will
only
have
place
in
a
cultivated
society
whereas
the
right
of
succession
is
regarded
even
among
the
greatest
barbarians
acquisition
of
property
by
accession
can
be
explained
no
way
but
by
having
recourse
to
the
relations
and
connexions
of
the
imaginations
the
property
of
rivers
by
the
laws
of
most
nations
and
by
the
natural
turn
of
our
thoughts
is
attributed
to
the
proprietors
of
their
banks
excepting
such
vast
rivers
as
the
rhine
or
the
danube
which
seem
too
large
to
follow
as
an
accession
to
the
property
of
the
neighbouring
fields
yet
even
these
rivers
are
considered
as
the
property
of
that
nation
through
whose
dominions
they
run
the
idea
of
a
nation
being
of
a
suitable
bulk
to
correspond
with
them
and
bear
them
such
a
relation
in
the
fancy
the
accessions
which
are
made
to
land
bordering
upon
rivers
follow
the
land
say
the
civilians
provided
it
be
made
by
what
they
call
alluvion
that
is
insensibly
and
imperceptibly
which
are
circumstances
that
assist
the
imagination
in
the
conjunction
where
there
is
any
considerable
portion
torn
at
once
from
one
bank
and
added
to
another
it
becomes
not
his
property
whose
land
it
falls
on
till
it
unite
with
the
land
and
till
the
trees
and
plants
have
spread
their
roots
into
both
before
that
the
thought
does
not
sufficiently
join
them
in
short
we
must
ever
distinguish
between
the
necessity
of
a
separation
and
constancy
in
men
possession
and
the
rules
which
assign
particular
objects
to
particular
persons
the
first
necessity
is
obvious
strong
and
invincible
the
latter
may
depend
on
a
public
utility
more
light
and
frivolous
on
the
sentiment
of
private
humanity
and
aversion
to
private
hardship
on
positive
laws
on
precedents
analogies
and
very
fine
connexions
and
turns
of
the
imagination
we
may
just
observe
before
we
conclude
this
subject
that
after
the
laws
of
justice
are
fixed
by
views
of
general
utility
the
injury
the
hardship
the
harm
which
result
to
any
individual
from
a
violation
of
them
enter
very
much
into
consideration
and
are
a
great
source
of
that
universal
blame
which
attends
every
wrong
or
iniquity
by
the
laws
of
society
this
coat
this
horse
is
mine
and
ought
to
remain
perpetually
in
my
possession
i
reckon
on
the
secure
enjoyment
of
it
by
depriving
me
of
it
you
disappoint
my
expectations
and
doubly
displease
me
and
offend
every
bystander
it
is
a
public
wrong
so
far
as
the
rules
of
equity
are
violated
it
is
a
private
harm
so
far
as
an
individual
is
injured
and
though
the
second
consideration
could
have
no
place
were
not
the
former
previously
established
for
otherwise
the
distinction
of
mine
and
thine
would
be
unknown
in
society
yet
there
is
no
question
but
the
regard
to
general
good
is
much
enforced
by
the
respect
to
particular
what
injures
the
community
without
hurting
any
individual
is
often
more
lightly
thought
of
but
where
the
greatest
public
wrong
is
also
conjoined
with
a
considerable
private
one
no
wonder
the
highest
disapprobation
attends
so
iniquitous
a
behaviour
appendix
iv
of
some
verbal
disputes
nothing
is
more
usual
than
for
philosophers
to
encroach
upon
the
province
of
grammarians
and
to
engage
in
disputes
of
words
while
they
imagine
that
they
are
handling
controversies
of
the
deepest
importance
and
concern
it
was
in
order
to
avoid
altercations
so
frivolous
and
endless
that
i
endeavoured
to
state
with
the
utmost
caution
the
object
of
our
present
enquiry
and
proposed
simply
to
collect
on
the
one
hand
a
list
of
those
mental
qualities
which
are
the
object
of
love
or
esteem
and
form
a
part
of
personal
merit
and
on
the
other
hand
a
catalogue
of
those
qualities
which
are
the
object
of
censure
or
reproach
and
which
detract
from
the
character
of
the
person
possessed
of
them
subjoining
some
reflections
concerning
the
origin
of
these
sentiments
of
praise
or
blame
on
all
occasions
where
there
might
arise
the
least
hesitation
i
avoided
the
terms
virtue
and
vice
because
some
of
those
qualities
which
i
classed
among
the
objects
of
praise
receive
in
the
english
language
the
appellation
of
talents
rather
than
of
virtues
as
some
of
the
blameable
or
censurable
qualities
are
often
called
defects
rather
than
vices
it
may
now
perhaps
be
expected
that
before
we
conclude
this
moral
enquiry
we
should
exactly
separate
the
one
from
the
other
should
mark
the
precise
boundaries
of
virtues
and
talents
vices
and
defects
and
should
explain
the
reason
and
origin
of
that
distinction
but
in
order
to
excuse
myself
from
this
undertaking
which
would
at
last
prove
only
a
grammatical
enquiry
i
shall
subjoin
the
four
following
reflections
which
shall
contain
all
that
i
intend
to
say
on
the
present
subject
first
i
do
not
find
that
in
the
english
or
any
other
modern
tongue
the
boundaries
are
exactly
fixed
between
virtues
and
talents
vices
and
defects
or
that
a
precise
definition
can
be
given
of
the
one
as
contradistinguished
from
the
other
were
we
to
say
for
instance
that
the
esteemable
qualities
alone
which
are
voluntary
are
entitled
to
the
appellations
of
virtues
we
should
soon
recollect
the
qualities
of
courage
equanimity
patience
with
many
others
which
almost
every
language
classes
under
this
appellation
though
they
depend
little
or
not
at
all
on
our
choice
should
we
affirm
that
the
qualities
alone
which
prompt
us
to
act
our
part
in
society
are
entitled
to
that
honourable
distinction
it
must
immediately
occur
that
these
are
indeed
the
most
valuable
qualities
and
are
commonly
denominated
the
social
virtues
but
that
this
very
epithet
supposes
that
there
are
also
virtues
of
another
species
should
we
lay
hold
of
the
distinction
between
intellectual
and
moral
endowments
and
affirm
the
last
alone
to
be
the
real
and
genuine
virtues
because
they
alone
lead
to
action
we
should
find
that
many
of
those
qualities
usually
called
intellectual
virtues
such
as
prudence
penetration
discernment
discretion
had
also
a
considerable
influence
on
conduct
the
distinction
between
the
heart
and
the
head
may
also
be
adopted
the
qualities
of
the
first
may
be
defined
such
as
in
their
immediate
exertion
are
accompanied
with
a
feeling
of
sentiment
and
these
alone
may
be
called
the
genuine
virtues
but
industry
frugality
temperance
secrecy
perseverance
and
many
other
laudable
powers
or
habits
generally
stilled
virtues
are
exerted
without
any
immediate
sentiment
in
the
person
possessed
of
them
and
are
only
known
to
him
by
their
effects
it
is
fortunate
amidst
all
this
seeming
perplexity
that
the
question
being
merely
verbal
can
not
possibly
be
of
any
importance
a
moral
philosophical
discourse
needs
not
enter
into
all
these
caprices
of
language
which
are
so
variable
in
different
dialects
and
in
different
ages
of
the
same
dialect
but
on
the
whole
it
seems
to
me
that
though
it
is
always
allowed
that
there
are
virtues
of
many
different
kinds
yet
when
a
man
is
called
virtuous
or
is
denominated
a
man
of
virtue
we
chiefly
regard
his
social
qualities
which
are
indeed
the
most
valuable
it
is
at
the
same
time
certain
that
any
remarkable
defect
in
courage
temperance
economy
industry
understanding
dignity
of
mind
would
bereave
even
a
very
honest
man
of
this
honourable
appellation
who
did
ever
say
except
by
way
of
irony
that
such
a
one
was
a
man
of
great
virtue
but
an
egregious
blockhead
but
secondly
it
is
no
wonder
that
languages
should
not
be
very
precise
in
marking
the
boundaries
between
virtues
and
talents
vices
and
defects
since
there
is
so
little
distinction
made
in
our
internal
estimation
of
them
it
seems
indeed
certain
that
the
sentiment
of
conscious
worth
the
proceeding
from
a
review
of
a
man
own
conduct
and
character
it
seems
certain
i
say
that
this
sentiment
which
though
the
most
common
of
all
others
has
no
proper
name
in
our
language
footnote
the
term
pride
is
commonly
taken
in
a
bad
sense
but
this
sentiment
seems
indifferent
and
may
be
either
good
or
bad
according
as
it
is
well
or
ill
founded
and
according
to
the
other
circumstances
which
accompany
it
the
french
express
this
sentiment
by
the
term
amour
propre
but
as
they
also
express
as
well
as
vanity
by
the
same
term
there
arises
thence
a
great
confusion
in
rochefoucault
and
many
of
their
moral
writers
arises
from
the
endowments
of
courage
and
capacity
industry
and
ingenuity
as
well
as
from
any
other
mental
excellencies
who
on
the
other
hand
is
not
deeply
mortified
with
reflecting
on
his
own
folly
and
dissoluteness
and
feels
not
a
secret
sting
or
compunction
whenever
his
memory
presents
any
past
occurrence
where
he
behaved
with
stupidity
of
no
time
can
efface
the
cruel
ideas
of
a
man
own
foolish
conduct
or
of
affronts
which
cowardice
or
impudence
has
brought
upon
him
they
still
haunt
his
solitary
hours
damp
his
most
aspiring
thoughts
and
show
him
even
to
himself
in
the
most
contemptible
and
most
odious
colours
imaginable
what
is
there
too
we
are
more
anxious
to
conceal
from
others
than
such
blunders
infirmities
and
meannesses
or
more
dread
to
have
exposed
by
raillery
and
satire
and
is
not
the
chief
object
of
vanity
our
bravery
or
learning
our
wit
or
breeding
our
eloquence
or
address
our
taste
or
abilities
these
we
display
with
care
if
not
with
ostentation
and
we
commonly
show
more
ambition
of
excelling
in
them
than
even
in
the
social
virtues
themselves
which
are
in
reality
of
such
superior
excellence
and
honesty
especially
the
latter
are
so
indispensably
required
that
though
the
greatest
censure
attends
any
violation
of
these
duties
no
eminent
praise
follows
such
common
instances
of
them
as
seem
essential
to
the
support
of
human
society
and
hence
the
reason
in
my
opinion
why
though
men
often
extol
so
liberally
the
qualities
of
their
heart
they
are
shy
in
commending
the
endowments
of
their
head
because
the
latter
virtues
being
supposed
more
rare
and
extraordinary
are
observed
to
be
the
more
usual
objects
of
pride
and
and
when
boasted
of
beget
a
strong
suspicion
of
these
sentiments
it
is
hard
to
tell
whether
you
hurt
a
man
character
most
by
calling
him
a
knave
or
a
coward
and
whether
a
beastly
glutton
or
drunkard
be
not
as
odious
and
contemptible
as
a
selfish
ungenerous
miser
give
me
my
choice
and
i
would
rather
for
my
own
happiness
and
have
a
friendly
humane
heart
than
possess
all
the
other
virtues
of
demosthenes
and
philip
united
but
i
would
rather
pass
with
the
world
for
one
endowed
with
extensive
genius
and
intrepid
courage
and
should
thence
expect
stronger
instances
of
general
applause
and
admiration
the
figure
which
a
man
makes
in
life
the
reception
which
he
meets
with
in
company
the
esteem
paid
him
by
his
acquaintance
all
these
advantages
depend
as
much
upon
his
good
sense
and
judgement
as
upon
any
other
part
of
his
character
had
a
man
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
and
were
the
farthest
removed
from
all
injustice
and
violence
he
would
never
be
able
to
make
himself
be
much
regarded
without
a
moderate
share
at
least
of
parts
and
understanding
what
is
it
then
we
can
here
dispute
about
if
sense
and
courage
temperance
and
industry
wisdom
and
knowledge
confessedly
form
a
considerable
part
of
personal
merit
if
a
man
possessed
of
these
qualities
is
both
better
satisfied
with
himself
and
better
entitled
to
the
esteem
and
services
of
others
than
one
entirely
destitute
of
them
if
in
short
the
sentiments
are
similar
which
arise
from
these
endowments
and
from
the
social
virtues
is
there
any
reason
for
being
so
extremely
scrupulous
about
a
word
or
disputing
whether

be
entitled
to
the
denomination
of
virtues
it
may
indeed
be
pretended
that
the
sentiment
of
approbation
which
those
accomplishments
produce
besides
its
being
inferior
is
also
somewhat
different
from
that
which
attends
the
virtues
of
justice
and
humanity
but
this
seems
not
a
sufficient
reason
for
ranking
them
entirely
under
different
classes
and
appellations
the
character
of
caesar
and
that
of
cato
as
drawn
by
sallust

both
of
them
virtuous
in
the
strictest
and
most
limited
sense
of
the
word
but
in
a
different
way
nor
are
the
sentiments
entirely
the
same
which
arise
from
them
the
one
produces
love
the
other
esteem
the

is

we
should
wish
to
meet
the
one
character
in
a
friend
the
other

should
be
ambitious
of
in
ourselves
in
like
manner
the
approbation
which
attends
temperance
or
industry
or
frugality
may
be
somewhat
different
from
that
which
is
paid
to
the
social
virtues
without
making
them
entirely
of
a
different
species
and
indeed
we
may
observe
that
these
endowments
more
than
the
other
virtues
produce
not
all
of
them
the
same
kind
of
approbation
good
sense
and
genius

esteem
and
regard

and
humour

love
and

footnote
love
and
esteem
are
nearly
the
same
passion
and
arise
from
similar
causes
the
qualities
which
produce
both
are
such
as
communicate
pleasures
but
where
this
pleasure
is
severe
and
serious
or
where
its
object
is
great
and
makes
a
strong
impression
or
where
it
produces
any
degree
of
humility
and
awe
in
all
these
cases
the
passion
which
arises
from
the
pleasure
is
more
properly
denominated
esteem
than
love
benevolence
attends
both
but
is
connected
with
love
in
a
more
eminent
degree
there
seems
to
be
still
a
stronger
mixture
of
pride
in
contempt
than
of
humility
in
esteem
and
the
reason
would
not
be
difficulty
to
one
who
studied
accurately
the
passions
all
these
various
mixtures
and
compositions
and
appearances
of
sentiment
from
a
very
curious
subject
of
speculation
but
are
wide
for
our
present
purpose
throughout
this
enquiry
we
always
consider
in
general
what
qualities
are
a
subject
of
praise
or
of
censure
without
entering
into
all
the
minute
differences
of
sentiment
which
they
excite
it
is
evident
that
whatever
is
contemned
is
also
disliked
as
well
as
what
is
hated
and
we
here
endeavour
to
take
objects
according
to
their
most
simple
views

the

reflection
which

purposed
to
make
in
suggesting
the
reason
why
modern
philosophers
have
often
followed
a
course
in
their
moral
enquiries
so
different
from
that
of
the
ancients
in
later
times
philosophy
of
all
kinds
especially
ethics
have
been
more
closely
united
with
theology
than
ever
they
were
observed
to
be
among
the
heathens
and
as
this
latter
science
admits
of
no
terms
of
composition
but
bends
every
branch
of
knowledge
to
its
own
purpose
without
much
regard
to
the
phenomena
of
nature
or
to
the
unbiassed
sentiments
of
the
mind
hence
reasoning
and
even
language
have
been
warped
from
their
natural
course
and
distinctions
have
been
endeavoured
to
be
established
where
the
difference
of
the
objects
was
in
a
manner
imperceptible
philosophers
or
rather
divines
under
that
disguise
treating
all
morals
as
on
a
like
footing
with
civil
laws
guarded
by
the
sanctions
of
reward
and
punishment
were
necessarily
led
to
render
this
circumstance
of
voluntary
or
involuntary
the
foundation
of
their
whole
theory
every
one
may
employ
terms
in
what
sense
he
pleases
but
this
in
the
mean
time
must
be
allowed
that
sentiments
are
every
day
experienced
of
blame
and
praise
which
have
objects
beyond
the
dominion
of
the
will
or
choice
and
of
which
it
behoves
us
if
not
as
moralists
as
speculative
philosophers
at
least
to
give
some
satisfactory
theory
and
explication
a
blemish
a
fault
a
vice
a
crime
these
expressions
seem
to
denote
different
degrees
of
censure
and
disapprobation
which
are
however
all
of
them
at
the
bottom
pretty
nearly
all
the
same
kind
of
species
the
explication
of
one
will
easily
lead
us
into
a
just
conception
of
the
others
and
it
is
of
greater
consequence
to
attend
to
things
than
to
verbal
appellations
that
we
owe
a
duty
to
ourselves
is
confessed
even
in
the
most
vulgar
system
of
morals
and
it
must
be
of
consequence
to
examine
that
duty
in
order
to
see
whether
it
bears
any
affinity
to
that
which
we
owe
to
society
it
is
probable
that
the
approbation
attending
the
observance
of
both
is
of
a
similar
nature
and
arises
from
similar
principles
whatever
appellation
we
may
give
to
either
of
these
excellencies
