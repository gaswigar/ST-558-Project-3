there
are
always
two
ways
of
looking
at
a
thing
frequently
there
are
six
or
seven
but
two
ways
of
looking
at
a
london
fog
are
quite
enough
when
it
is
thick
and
yellow
in
the
streets
and
stings
a
man
throat
and
lungs
as
he
breathes
it
an
awakening
in
the
early
morning
is
either
an
unearthly
and
grewsome
or
a
mysteriously
enclosing
secluding
and
comfortable
thing
if
one
awakens
in
a
healthy
body
and
with
a
clear
brain
rested
by
normal
sleep
and
retaining
memories
of
a
normally
agreeable
yesterday
one
may
lie
watching
the
housemaid
building
the
fire
and
after
she
has
swept
the
hearth
and
put
things
in
order
lie
watching
the
flames
of
the
blazing
and
crackling
wood
catch
the
coals
and
set
them
blazing
also
and
dancing
merrily
and
filling
corners
with
a
glow
and
in
so
lying
and
realizing
that
leaping
light
and
warmth
and
a
soft
bed
are
good
things
one
may
turn
over
on
one
back
stretching
arms
and
legs
luxuriously
drawing
deep
breaths
and
smiling
at
a
knowledge
of
the
fog
outside
which
makes
eight
on
a
december
morning
as
dark
as
twelve
on
a
december
night
under
such
conditions
the
soft
thick
yellow
gloom
has
its
picturesque
and
even
humorous
aspect
one
feels
enclosed
by
it
at
once
fantastically
and
cosily
and
is
inclined
to
revel
in
imaginings
of
the
picture
outside
its
rembrandt
lights
and
orange
yellows
the
halos
about
the
the
illumination
of
the
flare
of
torches
stuck
up
over
coster
barrows
and
the
shadows
on
the
faces
of
the
men
and
women
selling
and
buying
beside
them
refreshed
by
sleep
and
comfort
and
surrounded
by
light
warmth
and
good
cheer
it
is
easy
to
face
the
day
to
confront
going
out
into
the
fog
and
feeling
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
its
mysteries
this
is
one
way
of
looking
at
it
but
only
one
the
other
way
is
marked
by
enormous
differences
a
man
he
had
given
his
name
to
the
people
of
the
house
as
antony
dart
awakened
in
a
bedroom
in
a
in
a
poor
street
in
london
and
as
his
consciousness
returned
to
him
its
slow
and
reluctant
movings
confronted
the
second
point
of
view
marked
by
enormous
differences
he
had
not
slept
two
consecutive
hours
through
the
night
and
when
he
had
slept
he
had
been
tormented
by
dreary
dreams
which
were
more
full
of
misery
because
of
their
elusive
vagueness
which
kept
his
tortured
brain
on
a
wearying
strain
of
effort
to
reach
some
definite
understanding
of
them
yet
when
he
awakened
the
consciousness
of
being
again
alive
was
an
awful
thing
if
the
dreams
could
have
faded
into
blankness
and
all
have
passed
with
the
passing
of
the
night
how
he
could
have
thanked
whatever
gods
there
be
only
not
to
awake
only
not
to
awake
but
he
had
awakened
the
clock
struck
nine
as
he
did
so
consequently
he
knew
the
hour
the
slavey
had
aroused
him
by
coming
to
light
the
fire
she
had
set
her
candle
on
the
hearth
and
done
her
work
as
stealthily
as
possible
but
he
had
been
disturbed
though
he
had
made
a
desperate
effort
to
struggle
back
into
sleep
that
was
no
use
no
use
he
was
awake
and
he
was
in
the
midst
of
it
all
again
without
the
sense
of
luxurious
comfort
he
opened
his
eyes
and
turned
upon
his
back
throwing
out
his
arms
flatly
so
that
he
lay
as
in
the
form
of
a
cross
in
heavy
weariness
and
anguish
for
months
he
had
awakened
each
morning
after
such
a
night
and
had
so
lain
like
a
crucified
thing
as
he
watched
the
painful
flickering
of
the
damp
and
smoking
wood
and
coal
he
remembered
this
and
thought
that
there
had
been
a
lifetime
of
such
awakenings
not
knowing
that
the
morbidness
of
a
fagged
brain
blotted
out
the
memory
of
more
normal
days
and
told
him
fantastic
lies
which
were
but
a
hundredth
part
truth
he
could
see
only
the
hundredth
part
truth
and
it
assumed
proportions
so
huge
that
he
could
see
nothing
else
in
such
a
state
the
human
brain
is
an
infernal
machine
and
its
workings
can
only
be
conquered
if
the
mortal
thing
which
lives
with
it
day
and
night
night
and
day
has
learned
to
separate
its
controllable
from
its
seemingly
uncontrollable
atoms
and
can
silence
its
clamor
on
its
way
to
madness
antony
dart
had
not
learned
this
thing
and
the
clamor
had
had
its
hideous
way
with
him
physicians
would
have
given
a
name
to
his
mental
and
physical
condition
he
had
heard
these
names
often
applied
to
men
the
strain
of
whose
lives
had
been
like
the
strain
of
his
own
and
had
left
them
as
it
had
left
him
jaded
joyless
breaking
things
some
of
them
had
been
broken
and
had
died
or
were
dragging
out
bruised
and
tormented
days
in
their
own
homes
or
in
he
always
shuddered
when
he
heard
their
names
and
rebelled
with
sick
fear
against
the
mere
mention
of
them
they
had
worked
as
he
had
worked
they
had
been
stricken
with
the
delirium
of
accumulation
accumulation
as
he
had
been
they
had
been
caught
in
the
rush
and
swirl
of
the
great
maelstrom
and
had
been
borne
round
and
round
in
it
until
having
grasped
every
coveted
thing
tossing
upon
its
circling
waters
they
themselves
had
been
flung
upon
the
shore
with
both
hands
full
the
rocks
about
them
strewn
with
rich
possessions
while
they
lay
prostrate
and
gazed
at
all
life
had
brought
with
dull
hopeless
anguished
eyes
he
knew
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
what
would
be
said
of
him
because
he
had
heard
it
said
of
others
he
worked
too
hard
he
worked
too
hard
he
was
sick
of
hearing
it
what
was
wrong
with
the
world
what
was
wrong
with
man
as
man
if
work
could
break
him
like
this
if
one
believed
in
deity
the
living
creature
it
breathed
into
being
must
be
a
perfect
thing
not
one
to
be
wearied
sickened
tortured
by
the
life
its
breathing
had
created
a
mere
man
would
disdain
to
build
a
thing
so
poor
and
incomplete
a
mere
human
engineer
who
constructed
an
engine
whose
workings
were
perpetually
at
fault
which
went
wrong
when
called
upon
to
do
the
labor
it
was
made
for
who
would
not
scoff
at
it
and
cast
it
aside
as
a
piece
of
worthless
bungling
something
is
wrong
he
muttered
lying
flat
upon
his
cross
and
staring
at
the
yellow
haze
which
had
crept
through
crannies
in
into
the
room
someone
is
wrong
is
it
i
or
you
his
thin
lips
drew
themselves
back
against
his
teeth
in
a
mirthless
smile
which
was
like
a
grin
yes
he
said
i
am
pretty
far
gone
i
am
beginning
to
talk
to
myself
about
god
bryan
did
it
just
before
he
was
taken
to
hewletts
place
and
cut
his
throat
he
had
not
led
a
specially
evil
life
he
had
not
broken
laws
but
the
subject
of
deity
was
not
one
which
his
scheme
of
existence
had
included
when
it
had
haunted
him
of
late
he
had
felt
it
an
untoward
and
morbid
sign
the
thing
had
drawn
him
drawn
him
he
had
complained
against
it
he
had
argued
sometimes
he
knew
shuddering
that
he
had
raved
something
had
seemed
to
stand
aside
and
watch
his
being
and
his
thinking
something
which
filled
the
universe
had
seemed
to
wait
and
to
have
waited
through
all
the
eternal
ages
to
see
what
he
one
man
would
do
at
times
a
great
appalled
wonder
had
swept
over
him
at
his
realization
that
he
had
never
known
or
thought
of
it
before
it
had
been
there
always
through
all
the
ages
that
had
passed
and
sometimes
once
or
twice
the
thought
had
in
some
unspeakable
untranslatable
way
brought
him
a
moment
calm
but
at
other
times
he
had
said
to
himself
with
a
shivering
soul
cowering
within
him
that
this
was
only
part
of
it
all
and
was
a
beginning
perhaps
of
religious
monomania
during
the
last
week
he
had
known
what
he
was
going
to
do
he
had
made
up
his
mind
this
abject
horror
through
which
others
had
let
themselves
be
dragged
to
madness
or
death
he
would
not
endure
the
end
should
come
quickly
and
no
one
should
be
smitten
aghast
by
seeing
or
knowing
how
it
came
in
the
crowded
shabbier
streets
of
london
there
were
where
one
by
taking
precautions
could
end
his
life
in
such
a
manner
as
would
blot
him
out
of
any
world
where
such
a
man
as
himself
had
been
known
a
pistol
properly
managed
would
obliterate
resemblance
to
any
human
thing
months
ago
through
chance
talk
he
had
heard
how
it
could
be
done
and
done
quickly
he
could
leave
a
misleading
letter
he
had
planned
what
it
should
be
the
story
it
should
tell
of
a
disheartened
mediocre
venturer
of
his
poor
all
returning
bankrupt
and
humiliated
from
australia
ending
existence
in
such
pennilessness
that
the
parish
must
give
him
a
pauper
grave
what
did
it
matter
where
a
man
lay
so
that
he
slept
slept
slept
surely
with
one
brains
scattered
one
would
sleep
soundly
anywhere
he
had
come
to
the
house
the
night
before
dressed
shabbily
with
the
pitiable
respectability
of
a
defeated
man
he
had
entered
droopingly
with
bent
shoulders
and
hopeless
hang
of
head
in
his
own
sphere
he
was
a
man
who
held
himself
well
he
had
let
fall
a
few
dispirited
sentences
when
he
had
engaged
his
back
room
from
the
woman
of
the
house
and
she
had
recognized
him
as
one
of
the
luckless
in
fact
she
had
hesitated
a
moment
before
his
unreliable
look
until
he
had
taken
out
money
from
his
pocket
and
paid
his
rent
for
a
week
in
advance
she
would
have
that
at
least
for
her
trouble
he
had
said
to
himself
he
should
not
occupy
the
room
after
in
his
own
home
some
days
would
pass
before
his
household
began
to
make
inquiries
he
had
told
his
servants
that
he
was
going
over
to
paris
for
a
change
he
would
be
safe
and
deep
in
his
pauper
grave
a
week
before
they
asked
each
other
why
they
did
not
hear
from
him
all
was
in
order
one
of
the
mocking
agonies
was
that
living
was
done
for
he
had
ceased
to
live
work
pleasure
sun
moon
and
stars
had
lost
their
meaning
he
stood
and
looked
at
the
most
radiant
loveliness
of
land
and
sky
and
sea
and
felt
nothing
success
brought
greater
wealth
each
day
without
stirring
a
pulse
of
pleasure
even
in
triumph
there
was
nothing
left
but
the
awful
days
and
awful
nights
to
which
he
knew
physicians
could
give
their
scientific
name
but
had
no
healing
for
he
had
gone
far
enough
he
would
go
no
farther
it
would
have
been
over
long
hours
and
there
would
have
been
no
public
declaiming
over
the
humiliating
pitifulness
of
his
end
and
what
did
it
matter
how
thick
the
fog
was
outside
thick
enough
for
a
man
to
lose
himself
in
it
the
yellow
mist
which
had
crept
in
under
the
doors
and
through
the
crevices
of
the
gave
a
ghostly
look
to
the
room
a
ghastly
abnormal
look
he
said
to
himself
the
fire
was
smouldering
instead
of
blazing
but
what
did
it
matter
he
was
going
out
he
had
not
bought
the
pistol
last
night
like
a
fool
somehow
his
brain
had
been
so
tired
and
crowded
that
he
had
forgotten
forgotten
he
mentally
repeated
the
word
as
he
got
out
of
bed
by
this
time
he
should
have
forgotten
everything
this
time
his
mind
repeated
that
also
as
he
began
to
dress
himself
where
should
he
be
should
he
be
anywhere
suppose
he
awakened
again
to
something
as
bad
as
this
how
did
a
man
get
out
of
his
body
after
the
crash
and
shock
what
happened
did
one
find
oneself
standing
beside
the
thing
and
looking
down
at
it
it
would
not
be
a
good
thing
to
stand
and
look
down
on
even
for
that
which
had
deserted
it
but
having
torn
oneself
loose
from
it
and
its
devilish
aches
and
pains
one
would
not
care
one
would
see
how
little
it
all
mattered
anything
else
must
be
better
than
this
the
thing
for
which
there
was
a
scientific
name
but
no
healing
he
had
taken
all
the
drugs
he
had
obeyed
all
the
medical
orders
and
here
he
was
after
that
last
hell
of
a
night
dressing
himself
in
a
back
bedroom
of
a
cheap
to
go
out
and
buy
a
pistol
in
this
damned
fog
he
laughed
at
the
last
phrase
of
his
thought
the
laugh
which
was
a
mirthless
grin
i
am
thinking
of
it
as
if
i
was
afraid
of
taking
cold
he
said
and
there
would
be
no
were
at
an
end
no
more
nights
no
more
days
no
more
morrows
he
finished
dressing
putting
on
his
discriminatingly
chosen
clothes
with
a
care
for
the
effect
he
intended
them
to
produce
the
collar
and
cuffs
of
his
shirt
were
frayed
and
yellow
and
he
fastened
his
collar
with
a
pin
and
tied
his
worn
necktie
carelessly
his
overcoat
was
beginning
to
wear
a
greenish
shade
and
look
threadbare
so
was
his
hat
when
his
toilet
was
complete
he
looked
at
himself
in
the
cracked
and
hazy
glass
bending
forward
to
scrutinize
his
unshaven
face
under
the
shadow
of
the
dingy
hat
it
is
all
right
he
muttered
it
is
not
far
to
the
pawnshop
where
i
saw
it
the
stillness
of
the
room
as
he
turned
to
go
out
was
uncanny
as
it
was
a
back
room
there
was
no
street
below
from
which
could
arise
sounds
of
passing
vehicles
and
the
thickness
of
the
fog
muffled
such
sound
as
might
have
floated
from
the
front
he
stopped
to
the
door
not
knowing
why
and
listened
to
what
for
what
the
silence
seemed
to
spread
through
all
the
house
out
into
the
streets
through
all
london
through
all
the
world
and
he
to
stand
in
the
midst
of
it
a
man
on
the
way
to
death
with
no
what
did
it
mean
it
seemed
to
mean
something
the
world
withdrawn
life
withdrawn
sound
withdrawn
breath
withdrawn
he
stood
and
waited
perhaps
this
was
one
of
the
symptoms
of
the
morbid
thing
for
which
there
was
that
name
if
so
he
had
better
get
away
quickly
and
have
it
over
lest
he
be
found
wandering
about
not
knowing
not
knowing
but
now
he
knew
the
silence
he
waited
waited
and
tried
to
hear
as
if
something
was
calling
him
calling
without
sound
it
returned
to
him
the
thought
of
that
which
had
waited
through
all
the
ages
to
see
what
he
one
man
would
do
he
had
never
exactly
pitied
himself
before
he
did
not
know
that
he
pitied
himself
now
but
he
was
a
man
going
to
his
death
and
a
light
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
him
and
it
seemed
as
if
it
was
not
he
who
did
it
but
some
other
he
flung
out
his
arms
and
cried
aloud
words
he
had
not
known
he
was
going
to
speak
lord
lord
what
shall
i
do
to
be
saved
but
the
silence
gave
no
answer
it
was
the
silence
still
and
after
standing
a
few
moments
panting
his
arms
fell
and
his
head
dropped
and
turning
the
handle
of
the
door
he
went
out
to
buy
the
pistol
ii
as
he
went
down
the
narrow
staircase
covered
with
its
dingy
and
threadbare
carpet
he
found
the
house
so
full
of
dirty
yellow
haze
that
he
realized
that
the
fog
must
be
of
the
extraordinary
ones
which
are
remembered
in
as
abnormal
specimens
of
their
kind
he
recalled
that
there
had
been
one
of
the
sort
three
years
before
and
that
traffic
and
business
had
been
almost
entirely
stopped
by
it
that
accidents
had
happened
in
the
streets
and
that
people
having
lost
their
way
had
wandered
about
turning
corners
until
they
found
themselves
far
from
their
intended
destinations
and
obliged
to
take
refuge
in
hotels
or
the
houses
of
hospitable
strangers
curious
incidents
had
occurred
and
odd
stories
were
told
by
those
who
had
felt
themselves
obliged
by
circumstances
to
go
out
into
the
baffling
gloom
he
guessed
that
something
of
a
like
nature
had
fallen
upon
the
town
again
the
on
the
landings
and
in
the
melancholy
hall
burned
feebly
so
feebly
that
one
got
but
a
vague
view
of
the
rickety
and
the
shabby
overcoats
and
hanging
upon
it
it
was
well
for
him
that
he
had
but
a
corner
or
so
to
turn
before
he
reached
the
pawnshop
in
whose
window
he
had
seen
the
pistol
he
intended
to
buy
when
he
opened
the
he
saw
that
the
fog
was
upon
the
whole
perhaps
even
heavier
and
more
obscuring
if
possible
than
the
one
so
well
remembered
he
could
not
see
anything
three
feet
before
him
he
could
not
see
with
distinctness
anything
two
feet
ahead
the
sensation
of
stepping
forward
was
uncertain
and
mysterious
enough
to
be
almost
appalling
a
man
not
sufficiently
cautious
might
have
fallen
into
any
open
hole
in
his
path
antony
dart
kept
as
closely
as
possible
to
the
sides
of
the
houses
it
would
have
been
easy
to
walk
off
the
pavement
into
the
middle
of
the
street
but
for
the
edges
of
the
curb
and
the
step
downward
from
its
level
traffic
had
almost
absolutely
ceased
though
in
the
more
important
streets
were
making
efforts
to
guide
men
or
slowly
along
the
blind
feeling
of
the
thing
was
rather
awful
though
but
few
pedestrians
were
out
dart
found
himself
once
or
twice
brushing
against
or
coming
into
forcible
contact
with
men
feeling
their
way
about
like
himself
one
turn
to
the
right
he
repeated
mentally
two
to
the
left
and
the
place
is
at
the
corner
of
the
other
side
of
the
street
he
managed
to
reach
it
at
last
but
it
had
been
a
slow
and
therefore
long
journey
all
the
the
little
shop
owned
were
lighted
but
even
under
their
flare
the
articles
in
the
window
the
one
or
two
once
cheaply
gaudy
dresses
and
shawls
and
men
garments
hung
in
the
haze
like
the
dreary
dangling
ghosts
of
things
recently
executed
among
watches
and
forlorn
pieces
of
jewelry
and
odds
and
ends
the
pistol
lay
against
the
folds
of
a
dirty
gauze
shawl
there
it
was
it
would
have
been
annoying
if
someone
else
had
been
beforehand
and
had
bought
it
inside
the
shop
more
dangling
spectres
hung
and
the
place
was
almost
dark
it
was
a
shabby
pawnshop
and
the
man
lounging
behind
the
counter
was
a
shabby
man
with
an
unshaven
unamiable
face
i
want
to
look
at
that
pistol
in
the
corner
of
your
window
antony
dart
said
the
pawnbroker
uttered
a
sound
something
between
a
and
a
grunt
he
took
the
weapon
from
the
window
antony
dart
examined
it
critically
he
must
make
quite
sure
of
it
he
made
no
further
remark
he
felt
he
had
done
with
speech
being
told
the
price
asked
for
the
purchase
he
drew
out
his
purse
and
took
the
money
from
it
after
making
the
payment
he
noted
that
he
still
possessed
a
note
and
some
sovereigns
there
passed
through
his
mind
a
wonder
as
to
who
would
spend
it
the
most
decent
thing
perhaps
would
be
to
give
it
away
if
it
was
in
his
room
the
parish
would
not
bury
him
and
it
would
be
safer
that
the
parish
should
he
was
thinking
of
this
as
he
left
the
shop
and
began
to
cross
the
street
because
his
mind
was
wandering
he
was
less
watchful
suddenly
a
hansom
moving
without
sound
appeared
immediately
in
his
path
the
horse
head
loomed
up
above
his
own
he
made
the
inevitable
involuntary
whirl
aside
to
move
out
of
the
way
the
hansom
passed
and
turning
again
he
went
on
his
movement
had
been
too
swift
to
allow
of
his
realizing
the
direction
in
which
his
turn
had
been
made
he
was
wholly
unaware
that
when
he
crossed
the
street
he
crossed
backward
instead
of
forward
he
turned
a
corner
literally
feeling
his
way
went
on
turned
another
and
after
walking
the
length
of
the
street
suddenly
understood
that
he
was
in
a
strange
place
and
had
lost
his
bearings
this
was
exactly
what
had
happened
to
people
on
the
day
of
the
memorable
fog
of
three
years
before
he
had
heard
them
talking
of
such
experiences
and
of
the
curious
and
baffling
sensations
they
gave
rise
to
in
the
brain
now
he
understood
them
he
could
not
be
far
from
his
lodgings
but
he
felt
like
a
man
who
was
blind
and
who
had
been
turned
out
of
the
path
he
knew
he
had
not
the
resource
of
the
people
whose
stories
he
had
heard
he
would
not
stop
and
address
anyone
there
could
be
no
certainty
as
to
whom
he
might
find
himself
speaking
to
he
would
speak
to
no
one
he
would
wander
about
until
he
came
upon
some
clew
even
if
he
came
upon
none
the
fog
would
surely
lift
a
little
and
become
a
trifle
less
dense
in
course
of
time
he
drew
up
the
collar
of
his
overcoat
pulled
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
and
went
on
his
hand
on
the
thing
he
had
thrust
into
a
pocket
he
did
not
find
his
clew
as
he
had
hoped
and
instead
of
lifting
the
fog
grew
heavier
he
found
himself
at
last
no
longer
striving
for
any
end
but
rambling
along
mechanically
feeling
like
a
man
in
a
dream
a
nightmare
once
he
recognized
a
weird
suggestion
in
the
mystery
about
him
might
one
be
wandering
about
aimlessly
in
some
such
haze
he
hoped
not
his
lodgings
were
not
far
from
the
embankment
and
he
knew
at
last
that
he
was
wandering
along
it
and
had
reached
one
of
the
bridges
his
mood
led
him
to
turn
in
upon
it
and
when
he
reached
an
embrasure
to
stop
near
it
and
lean
upon
the
parapet
looking
down
he
could
not
see
the
water
the
fog
was
too
dense
but
he
could
hear
some
faint
splashing
against
stones
he
had
taken
no
food
and
was
rather
faint
what
a
strange
thing
it
was
to
feel
faint
for
want
of
food
to
stand
alone
cut
off
from
every
other
human
being
everything
done
for
no
wonder
that
sometimes
particularly
on
such
days
as
these
there
were
plunges
made
from
the
parapet
no
wonder
he
leaned
farther
over
and
strained
his
eyes
to
see
some
gleam
of
water
through
the
yellowness
but
it
was
not
to
be
done
he
was
thinking
the
inevitable
thing
of
course
but
such
a
plunge
would
not
do
for
him
the
other
thing
would
destroy
all
traces
as
he
drew
back
he
heard
something
fall
with
the
solid
tinkling
sound
of
coin
on
the
flag
pavement
when
he
had
been
in
the
pawnbroker
shop
he
had
taken
the
gold
from
his
purse
and
thrust
it
carelessly
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
thinking
that
it
would
be
easy
to
reach
when
he
chose
to
give
it
to
one
beggar
or
another
if
he
should
see
some
wretch
who
would
be
the
better
for
it
some
movement
he
had
made
in
bending
had
caused
a
sovereign
to
slip
out
and
it
had
fallen
upon
the
stones
he
did
not
intend
to
pick
it
up
but
in
the
moment
in
which
he
stood
looking
down
at
it
he
heard
close
to
him
a
shuffling
movement
what
he
had
thought
a
bundle
of
rags
or
rubbish
covered
with
sacking
some
tramp
deserted
or
forgotten
belongings
was
stirring
it
was
alive
and
as
he
bent
to
look
at
it
the
sacking
divided
itself
and
a
small
head
covered
with
a
shock
of
brilliant
red
hair
thrust
itself
out
a
shrewd
small
face
turning
to
look
up
at
him
slyly
with
black
eyes
it
was
a
human
girl
creature
about
twelve
years
old
are
yer
goin
to
do
it
she
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
yer
would
be
a
fool
if
yer
did
with
as
much
as
that
on
yer
she
pointed
with
a
reddened
chapped
and
dirty
hand
at
the
sovereign
pick
it
up
he
said
you
may
have
it
her
wild
shuffle
forward
was
an
actual
leap
the
hand
made
a
snatching
clutch
at
the
coin
she
was
evidently
afraid
that
he
was
either
not
in
earnest
or
would
repent
the
next
second
she
was
on
her
feet
and
ready
for
flight
stop
he
said
i
got
more
to
give
away
she
hesitated
not
believing
him
yet
feeling
it
madness
to
lose
a
chance
more
she
gasped
then
she
drew
nearer
to
him
and
a
singular
change
came
upon
her
face
it
was
a
change
which
made
her
look
oddly
human
gawd
mister
she
said
yer
can
give
away
a
quid
like
it
was
nothin
an
yer
got
more
an
yer
goin
to
do
that
jes

mornin

it
straight
from
me
do
yer
do
it
i
give
yer
that
tip
for
the
suvrink
she
was
for
her
years
so
ugly
and
so
ancient
and
hardened
in
voice
and
skin
and
manner
that
she
fascinated
him
not
that
a
man
who
has
no
in
view
is
likely
to
be
particularly
conscious
of
mental
processes
he
was
done
for
but
he
stood
and
stared
at
her
what
part
of
the
power
moving
the
scheme
of
the
universe
stood
near
and
thrust
him
on
in
the
path
designed
he
did
not
know
then
perhaps
never
did
he
was
still
holding
on
to
the
thing
in
his
pocket
but
he
spoke
to
her
again
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
glumly
she
sidled
nearer
her
sharp
eyes
on
his
face
i
bin
watchin
yer
she
said
i
sat
down
and
pulled
the
sack
over
me
to
breathe

it
an
get
a
bit
warm
an
i

it
nevertheless

a
slice
o
polony
sossidge
i
found
on
a
come
on
mister
she
pulled
his
coat
with
her
cracked
hand
he
glanced
down
at
it
mechanically
and
saw
that
some
of
the
fissures
had
bled
and
the
roughened
surface
was
smeared
with
the
blood
they
stood
together
in
the
small
space
in
which
the
fog
enclosed
them
he
and
she
the
man
with
no
and
the
girl
thing
who
seemed
as
old
as
himself
with
her
sharp
small
nose
and
chin
her
sharp
eyes
and
voice
and
yet
perhaps
the
fogs
enclosing
did
it
something
drew
them
together
in
an
uncanny
way
something
made
him
forget
the
lost
clew
to
the
something
made
him
turn
and
go
with
her
a
thing
led
in
the
dark
how
can
you
find
your
way
he
said
i
lost
mine
there
ai
no
fog
can
lose
me
she
answered
shuffling
along
by
his
side
it
goin
to
lift
look
at
that
man
comin
us
it
was
true
that
they
could
see
through
the
mist
the
approaching
figure
of
a
man
who
was
at
a
yard
distance
from
them
yes
it
was
lifting
slightly
at
least
enough
to
allow
of
one
making
a
guess
at
the
direction
in
which
one
moved
where
are
you
going
he
asked
apple
blossom
court
she
answered
the
in
a
street
near
it
and
there
a
shop
where
i
can
buy
things

he
ejaculated
what
a
name

no
smell

as
nice
as
its
nime
is
apple
blossom

pair
of

the
shoes
her
naked
feet
were
thrust
into
were
things
through
which
nearly
all
her
toes
protruded
but
she
chuckled
when
he
spoke
no
i
goin
to
buy

tirarer

opery

said
dragging
her

neck

noo
un
since

went
to

last
it
was
impudent
street
chaff
but
there
was
cheerful
spirit
in
it
and
cheerful
spirit
has
some
occult
effect
upon
morbidity
antony
dart
did
not
smile
but
he
felt
a
faint
stirring
of
curiosity
which
was
after
all
not
a
bad
thing
for
a
man
who
had
not
felt
an
interest
for
a
year
what
is
it

are
going
to

moment
to
drag

the
heel
of
her
dreadful
shoe
she
answered
him
with
an
unprejudiced
directness
which
might
have
been
appalling
if
he
had
been
in
the
mood
to
be
appalled
ai
eighteen
an
tryin
to
earn

and
he
tightened

very
much
she
gave
him
one
of
the
sly
squinting
glances
deservin
cases
she
put
it
to
him
in
brazen
mockery
i
do
care
he
answered
slowly
and
heavily
i
do
care
a
damn
her
face
changed
exactly
as
he
had
seen
it
change
on
the
bridge
when
she
had
drawn
nearer
to
him
its
ugly
hardness
suddenly
looked
human
and
that
she
could
look
human
was
fantastic
much
yer
she
asked
much
is
it
about
ten
pounds
she
stopped
and
stared
at
him
with
open
mouth
gawd
she
broke
out
ten
pounds

blossom
court
to
leastways
it
take
some
of
it
out
o

he
said
roughly
take

she
began
to
walk
quickly
breathing
fast
the
fog
was
lighter
and
it
was
no
longer
a
blinding
thing
a
question
occurred
to
dart
why
do
you
ask
me
to
give
the
money
to
you
he
said
bluntly
dunno
she
answered
as
bluntly
but
after
taking
a
few
steps
farther
she
spoke
again
i
cheerfler
than
most
of
she
elaborated
if
yer
born
cheerfle
yer
can
stand
things
when
i
gets
a
job

than

when
old
enough
to
go
on
the
street
the
organ
of
whose
lagging
sick
pumpings
antony
dart
had
scarcely
been
aware
for
months
gave
a
sudden
leap
in
his
breast
his
blood
actually
hastened
its
pace
and
ran
through
his
veins
instead
of
crawling
a
distinct
physical
effect
of
an
actual
mental
condition
it
was
produced
upon
him
by
the
mere
ordinariness
of
her
tone
he
had
never
been
a
sentimental
man
and
had
long
ceased
to
be
a
feeling
one
but
at
that
moment
something
emotional
and
normal
happened
to
him
you
expect
to
live
in
that
way
he
said
ai
nothin
else
fer
me
to
do
wisht
i
was

an
ugly
little
devil
but
ye

she
was
leading
him
through
a
narrow
filthy
back
street
and
she
stopped
grinning
up
in
his
face
i
say
mister
she
wheedled
let
stop
at
the
it
up
this
way
when
he
acceded
and
followed
her
she
quickly
turned
a
corner
they
were
in
another
lane
thick
with
fog
which
flared
with
the
flame
of
torches
stuck
in
costers
barrows
which
stood
here
and
there
barrows
with
fried
fish
upon
them
barrows
with
vegetables
and
others
piled
with
more
than
garments
trade
was
not
driving
but
near
one
or
two
of
them
dirty
looking
women
a
man
or
so
and
a
few
children
stood
at
a
corner
which
led
into
a
black
hole
of
a
court

was
stationed
in
charge
of
a
burly
ruffian
in
corduroys
come
along
said
the
girl
there
it
is

ai
strong
but
she
sidled
up
to
the
stand
drawing

with
her
as

of

the
girl
held
out
her
hand
cautiously
the
piece
of
gold
lying
upon
its
palm
look
she
said
there
were
two
or
three
men
slouching
about
the
stand
suddenly
a
hand
darted
from
between
two
of
them
who
stood
nearest
the
sovereign
was
snatched
a
screamed
oath
from
the
girl
rent
the
thick
air
and
a
forlorn
enough
scarecrow
of
a
young
fellow
sprang
away
the
blood
leaped
in
antony
dart
veins
again
and
he
sprang
after
him
in
a
wholly
normal
passion
of
indignation
a
thousand
years
ago
as
it
seemed
to
him
he
had
been
a
good
runner
this
man
was
not
one
and
want
of
food
had
weakened
him
dart
went
after
him
with
strides
which
astonished
himself
up
the
street
into
an
alley
and
out
of
it
a
dozen
yards
more
and
into
a
court
and
the
man
wheeled
with
a
hoarse
baffled
curse
the
place
had
no
outlet
hell
was
all
the
creature
said
dart
took
him
by
his
greasy
collar
even
the
brief
rush
had
left
him
feeling
like
a
living
thing
which
was
a
new
sensation
give
it
up
he
ordered
the
thief
looked
at
him
with
a
and
obeyed
as
if
he
felt
the
uselessness
of
a
struggle
he
was
not
more
than
years
old
and
his
eyes
were
cavernous
with
want
he
had
the
face
of
a
man
who
might
have
belonged
to
a
better
class
when
he
had
uttered
the
exclamation
invoking
the
infernal
regions
he
had
not
dropped
the
aspirate
i
as
hungry
as
she
is
he
raved
hungry
enough
to
rob
a
child
beggar
said
dart
hungry
enough
to
rob
a
starving
old
woman
or
a
baby
with
a
defiant
snort
wolf
hungry
tiger
hungry
hungry
enough
to
cut
throats
he
whirled
himself
loose
and
leaned
his
body
against
the
wall
turning
his
face
toward
it
suddenly
he
made
a
choking
sound
and
began
to
sob
hell
he
choked
i
give
it
up
i
give
it
up
what
a
figure
what
a
figure
as
he
swung
against
the
blackened
wall
his
scarecrow
clothes
hanging
on
him
their
once
decent
material
making
their
pinning
together
of
buttonless
places
their
looseness
and
rents
showing
dirty
linen
more
abject
than
any
other
squalor
could
have
made
them
antony
dart
blood
still
running
warm
and
well
was
doing
its
normal
work
among
the
which
had
stirred
so
evilly
through
the
night
when
he
had
seized
the
fellow
by
the
collar
his
hand
had
left
his
pocket
he
thrust
it
into
another
pocket
and
drew
out
some
silver
go
and
get
yourself
some
food
he
said
as
much
as
you
can
eat
then
go
and
wait
for
me
at
the
place
they
call
apple
blossom
court

where
it
is
but
i
am
going
there
i
want
to
hear
how
you
came
to
this
will
you
come
the
thief
lurched
away
from
the
wall
and
toward
him
he
stared
up
into
his
eyes
through
the
fog
the
tears
had
smeared
his
cheekbones
god
he
said
will
i
come
look
and
see
if

he
answered
and
he
gave
him
the
money

going
back
to
the
the
thief
stood
staring
after
him
as
he
went
out
of
the
court
dart
was
speaking
to
himself
i
do
know
why
i
did
it
he
said
but
the
thing
had
to
be
done
in
the
street
he
turned
into
he
came
upon
the
robbed
girl
running
panting
and
crying
she
uttered
a
shout
and
flung
herself
upon
him
clutching
his
coat
gawd
she
sobbed
hysterically

with
her
sobs
and
sniffs
rubbing
her
face
in
her
sack

your
sovereign
dart
said
handing
it
to
her
she
dropped
the
corner
of
the
sack
and
looked

with
a
queer
laugh

some
money
and

him
to

she
stopped
short
and
drew
back
a
pace
to
stare
up
at
him
well
she
gave
forth
y
are
a
queer
one
and
yet
in
the
amazement
on
her
face
he
perceived
a
remote
dawning
of
an
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
the
thing
he
had
done
he
had
spoken
like
a
man
in
a
dream
he
felt
like
a
man
in
a
dream

led
in
the
thick
mist
from
place
to
place
he
was
led
back
to

changed
his
mind
concerning
her
a
solid
sovereign
which
must
be
changed
and
a
companion
whose
shabby
gentility
was
absolute
grandeur
when

with

a
difference

darted
into
dirty
shops
and
brought
out
things

upward
glance

he
answered
i
do

damn
the
final
expletive
was
totally
unnecessary
but
it
meant
a
thing
he
did
not
say
whatsoever
was
thrusting
him
this
way
and
that
speaking
through
his
speech
leading
him
to
do
things
he
had
not
dreamed
of
doing
should
have
its
will
with
him
he
had
been
fastened
to
the
skirts
of
this
beggar
imp
and
he
would
go
on
to
the
end
and
do
what
was
to
be
done
this
day
it
was
part
of
the
dream
the
sack
of
coal
was
over
his
shoulder
when
they
turned
into
apple
blossom
court
it
would
have
been
a
black
hole
on
a
sunny
day
and
now
it
was
like
hades
lit
grimly
by
a
or
two
small
and
flickering
with
the
orange
haze
about
them
filthy
flagging
murky
doorways
broken
steps
and
broken
windows
stuffed
with
rags
and
the
smell
of
the
sewers
let
loose
had
apple
blossom
court
glad
with
the
wealth
of
the
pork
and
ham
shop
and
other
riches
in
her
arms
entered
a
repellent
doorway
in
a
spirit
of
great
good
cheer
and
dart
followed
her
past
a
room
where
a
drunken
woman
lay
sleeping
with
her
head
on
a
table
a
child
pulling
at
her
dress
and
crying
up
a
stairway
with
broken
balusters
and
breaking
steps
through
a
landing
upstairs
again
and
up
still
farther
until
they
reached
the
top
glad
stopped
before
a
door
and
shook
the
handle
crying
out
only
me
polly
you
can
open
it
she
added
to
dart
in
an
undertone
she
to
keep
it
locked
no
knowin
who
want
to
get
in
polly
shaking
the
again
polly
only
me
the
door
opened
slowly
on
the
other
side
of
it
stood
a
girl
with
a
dimpled
round
face
which
was
quite
pale
under
one
of
her
childishly
vacant
blue
eyes
was
a
discoloration
and
her
curly
fair
hair
was
tucked
up
on
the
top
of
her
head
in
a
knot
as
she
took
in
the
fact
of
antony
dart
presence
her
chin
began
to
quiver
i
ai
fit
to
to
see
no
one
she
stammered
pitifully
why
did
you
glad
why
did
you
ai
no
in
said
glad
one
o
the
friendly
ones
give
me
a
suvrink
look
wot
i
got
hopping
about
as
she
showed
her
parcels
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
me
antony
dart
said
he
paused
a
second
staring
at
her
and
suddenly
added
poor
little
wretch
her
look
was
so
scared
and
uncertain
a
thing
that
he
walked
away
from
her
and
threw
the
sack
of
coal
on
the
hearth
a
small
grate
with
broken
bars
hung
loosely
in
the
fireplace
a
battered
tin
kettle
tilted
drunkenly
near
it
a
mattress
from
the
holes
in
whose
ticking
straw
bulged
lay
on
the
floor
in
a
corner
with
some
old
sacks
thrown
over
it
glad
had
without
doubt
borrowed
her
shoulder
covering
from
the
collection
the
garret
was
as
cold
as
the
grave
and
almost
as
dark
the
fog
hung
in
it
thickly
there
were
crevices
enough
through
which
it
could
penetrate
antony
dart
knelt
down
on
the
hearth
and
drew
matches
from
his
pocket
we
ought
to
have
brought
some
paper
he
said
glad
ran
forward
wot
a
gent
ye
are
she
cried
y
ai
never
goin
to
light
it
yes
she
ran
back
to
the
rickety
table
and
collected
the
scraps
of
paper
which
had
held
her
purchases
they
were
small
but
useful
that
wot
was
round
the
sausage
an
the
puddin
greasy
she
exulted
polly
hung
over
the
table
and
trembled
at
the
sight
of
meat
and
bread
plainly
she
did
not
understand
what
was
happening
the
greased
paper
set
light
to
the
wood
and
the
wood
to
the
coal
all
three
flared
and
blazed
with
a
sound
of
cheerful
crackling
the
blaze
threw
out
its
glow
as
finely
as
if
it
had
been
set
alight
to
warm
a
better
place
the
wonder
of
a
fire
is
like
the
wonder
of
a
soul
this
one
changed
the
murk
and
gloom
to
brightness
and
the
deadly
damp
and
cold
to
warmth
it
drew
the
girl
polly
from
the
table
despite
her
fears
she
turned
involuntarily
made
two
steps
toward
it
and
stood
gazing
while
its
light
played
on
her
face
glad
whirled
and
ran
to
the
hearth
ye
put
on
a
lot
she
cried
but
oh
my
gawd
do
it
warm
yer
come
on
polly
come
on
she
dragged
out
a
wooden
stool
an
empty
and
bundled
the
sacks
into
a
heap
to
be
sat
upon
she
swept
the
things
from
the
table
and
set
them
in
their
paper
wrappings
on
the
floor
let
all
sit
down
close
to
it
close
she
said
an
get
warm
eat
an
eat
she
was
the
leaven
which
leavened
the
lump
of
their
humanity
what
this
leaven
is
who
has
found
out
but
she
little
rat
of
the
gutter
was
formed
of
it
and
her
mere
pure
animal
joy
in
the
temporary
animal
comfort
of
the
moment
stirred
and
uplifted
them
from
their
depths

they
drew
near
and
sat
upon
the
substitutes
for
seats
in
a
circle
and
the
fire
threw
up
flame
and
made
a
glow
in
the
fog
hanging
in
the
black
hole
of
a
room
it
was
glad
who
set
the
battered
kettle
on
and
when
it
boiled
made
tea
the
other
two
watched
her
being
under
her
spell
she
handed
out
slices
of
bread
and
sausage
and
pudding
on
bits
of
paper
polly
fed
with
tremulous
haste
glad
herself
with
rejoicing
and
exulting
in
flavors
antony
dart
ate
bread
and
meat
as
he
had
eaten
the
bread
and
dripping
at
the
stall
accepting
his
normal
hunger
as
part
of
the
dream
suddenly
glad
paused
in
the
midst
of
a
huge
bite

he
who

at
the
door
she
stopped
and
looked
round
with
a
grin

up
the
fire
polly
she
threw
back
ai
it
warm
and
cheerful
it
do
the
cove
good
to
see
it
she
led
the
way
down
the
black
unsafe
stairway
she
always
led
outside
the
fog
had
thickened
again
but
she
went
through
it
as
if
she
could
see
her
way
at
the
entrance
to
the
court
the
thief
was
standing
leaning
against
the
wall
with
fevered
unhopeful
waiting
in
his
eyes
he
moved
miserably
when
he
saw
the
girl
and
she
called
out
to
reassure
him
i
ai
up
to
no
she
said
i

the
gent
antony
dart

to
him

his
head
i
turned
faint
after

and
when
i
came
to
i
was
afraid
i
might
miss
you
he
answered
i

chance
i
bought
some
bread
and

in
my
pocket

eating
it
while
i
stood
here

back
with
us
said
dart
we
are
in
a
place
where
we
have
some
food
he
spoke
mechanically
and
was
aware
that
he
did
so
he
was
a
pawn
pushed
about
upon
the
board
of
this
day
life
come
on
said
the
girl
yer
can
get
enough
to
last
fer
three
days
she
guided
them
back
through
the
fog
until
they
entered
the
murky
doorway
again
then
she
almost
ran
up
the
staircase
to
the
room
they
had
left
when
the
door
opened
the
thief
fell
back
a
pace
as
before
an
unexpected
thing
it
was
the
flare
of
firelight
which
struck
upon
his
eyes
he
passed
his
hand
over
them
a
fire
he
said
i
have
seen
one
for
a
week
coming
out
of
the
blackness
it
gives
a
man
a
start
improvident
joy
gleamed
in
glad
eyes
we
be
warm
onct
she
chuckled
if
we
ai
never
warm
agaen
she
drew
her
circle
about
the
hearth
again
the
thief
took
the
place
next
to
her
and
she
handed
out
food
to
him
a
big
slice
of
meat
bread
a
thick
slice
of
pudding
fill
yerself
up
she
said
then
ye
feel
like
yer
can
talk
the
man
tried
to
eat
his
food
with
decorum
some
recollection
of
the
habits
of
better
days
restraining
him
but
starved
nature
was
too
much
for
him
his
hands
shook
his
eyes
filled
his
teeth
tore
the
rest
of
the
circle
tried
not
to
look
at
him
glad
and
polly
occupied
themselves
with
their
own
food
antony
dart
gazed
at
the
fire
here
he
sat
warming
himself
in
a
loft
with
a
beggar
a
thief
and
a
helpless
thing
of
the
street
he
had
come
out
to
buy
a
pistol
its
weight
still
hung
in
his
overcoat
pocket
and
he
had
reached
this
place
of
whose
existence
he
had
an
hour
ago
not
dreamed
each
step
which
had
led
him
had
seemed
a
simple
inevitable
thing
for
which
he
had
apparently
been
responsible
but
which
he
knew
yes
somehow
he
knew
he
had
of
his
own
volition
neither
planned
nor
meant
yet
here
he
sat
a
part
of
the
lives
of
the
beggar
the
thief
and
the
poor
thing
of
the
street
what
did
it
mean
tell
me
he
said
to
the
thief
how
you
came
here
by
this
time
the
young
fellow
had
fed
himself
and
looked
less
like
a
wolf
it
was
to
be
seen
now
that
he
had
eyes
which
were
dreamy
and
young
i
have
always
been
inventing
things
he
said
a
little
huskily
i
did
it
when
i
was
a
child
i
always
seemed
to
see
there
might
be
a
way
of
doing
a
thing
better
getting
more
power
when
other
boys
were
playing
games
i
was
sitting
in
corners
trying
to
build
models
out
of
wire
and
string
and
old
boxes
and
tin
cans
i
often
thought
i
saw
the
way
to
things
but
i
was
always
too
poor
to
get
what
was
needed
to
work
them
out
twice
i
heard
of
men
making
great
names
and
for
tunes
because
they
had
been
able
to
finish
what
i
could
have
finished
if
i
had
had
a
few
pounds
it
used
to
drive
me
mad
and
break
my
heart
his
hands
clenched
themselves
and
his
huskiness
grew
thicker
there
was
a
man
catching
his
breath
who
leaped
to
the
top
of
the
ladder
and
set
the
whole
world
talking
and
writing
and
i
had
done
the
thing
first
i
swear
i
had
it
was
all
clear
in
my
brain
and
i
was
half
mad
with
joy
over
it
but
i
could
not
afford
to
work
it
out
he
could
so
to
the
end
of
time
it
will
be
his
he
struck
his
fist
upon
his
knee
aw
the
deep
little
drawl
was
a
groan
from
glad
i
got
a
place
in
an
office
at
last
i
worked
hard
and
they
began
to
trust
me
i
had
a
new
idea
it
was
a
big
one
i
needed
money
to
work
it
out
i
i
remembered
what
had
happened
before
i
felt
like
a
poor
fellow
running
a
race
for
his
life
i
knew
i
could
pay
back
ten
times
a
hundred
times
what
i
took
you
took
money
said
dart
the
thief
head
dropped
no
i
was
caught
when
i
was
taking
it
i
was
sharp
enough
someone
came
in
and
saw
me
and
there
was
a
crazy
row
i
was
sent
to
prison
there
was
no
more
trying
after
that
it
nearly
two
years
since
and
i
been
hanging
about
the
streets
and
falling
lower
and
lower
run
miles
panting
after
cabs
with
luggage
in
them
and
not
had
strength
to
carry
in
the
boxes
when
they
stopped
i
starved
and
slept
out
of
doors
but
the
thing
i
wanted
to
work
out
is
in
my
mind
all
the
time
like
some
machine
tearing
round
it
wants
to
be
finished
it
never
will
be
that
all
glad
was
leaning
forward
staring
at
him
her
roughened
hands
with
the
smeared
cracks
on
them
clasped
round
her
knees
things
to
be
finished
she
said
they
finish
theirselves
how
do
you
know
dart
turned
on
her
dunno
i
know
but
i
do
when
things
begin
they
finish
it
like
a
wheel
rollin
down
an
her
sharp
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
dart
all
of
us
finish
somethin
we
begun
you
will
polly
will
will
i
will
she
stopped
with
a
sudden
sheepish
chuckle
and
dropped
her
forehead
on
her
knees
giggling
dunno
wot
i
talking
about
she
said
but
it
true
dart
began
to
understand
that
it
was
and
he
also
saw
that
this
ragged
thing
who
knew
nothing
whatever
looked
out
on
the
world
with
the
eyes
of
a
seer
though
she
was
ignorant
of
the
meaning
of
her
own
knowledge
it
was
a
weird
thing
he
turned
to
the
girl
polly
tell
me
how
you
came
here
he
said
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
and
gently
he
did
not
want
to
frighten
her
but
he
wanted
to
know
how
she
had
begun
when
she
lifted
her
childish
eyes
to
his
her
chin
began
to
shake
for
some
reason
she
did
not
question
his
right
to
ask
what
he
would
she
answered
him
meekly
as
her
fingers
fumbled
with
the
stuff
of
her
dress
i
lived
in
the
country
with
my
mother
she
said
we
was
very
happy
together
in
the
spring
there
was
primroses
and
and
lambs
i
abide
to
look
at
the
sheep
in
the
park
these
days
they
remind
me
so
there
was
a
girl
in
the
village
got
a
place
in
town
and
came
back
and
told
us
all
about
it
it
made
me
silly
i
wanted
to
come
here
too
i
i
came
she
put
her
arm
over
her
face
and
began
to
sob
she
ca
tell
you
said
glad
there
was
a
swell
in
the
made
love
to
her
she
used
to
carry
up

an
talked
to
a
wye
with
polly
broke
into
a
smothered
wail
oh

she
cried
i
have
let
him

over
me

have
let

nearly
did
it
said
glad

an
she
never

of

from
under
polly
arm
came
broken
words
i
could
tell
my
mother

know
how
i
was
too
frightened
and
ashamed
now
it
too
late

mother

and
it
seems
as
if
all
the
lambs
and
primroses
in
the
world
was
dead
oh
they
dead
they
dead
and
i
wish
i
was
too
glad
eyes
winked
rapidly
and
she
gave
a
hoarse
little
cough
to
clear
her
throat
her
arms
still
clasping
her
knees
she
hitched
herself
closer
to
the
girl
and
gave
her
a
nudge
with
her
elbow
buck
up
polly
she
said
we
ai
none
of
us

she
chuckled
again
dart
picked
up
some
fresh
sticks
and
threw
them
on
the
fire
there
was
some
fine
crackling
and
a
new
flame
leaped
up
if
you
could
do
what
you
liked
he
said
what
would
you
like
to
do
her
chuckle
became
an
outright
laugh
if
i
ten
pounds
she
asked
evidently
prepared
to
adjust
herself
in
imagination
to
any
form
of
good
luck
if
you
had
more
his
tone
made
the
thief
lift
his
head
to
look
at
him
if
i
a
wand
like
the
one
jem
told
me
was
in
the
pantermine
yes
he
answered
she
sat
and
stared
at
the
fire
a
few
moments
and
then
began
to
speak
in
a
low
luxuriating
voice

she
a
old

in

hands
oh
when
they
took

hospital
she
shuddered

lifted
her

what
dunno
with
an
uncertain
even
slightly
awed
laugh
dunno
wot

did
neither
does
nobody

but
somethin
it
was
along
of
a
lidy
as
come
in
one
day
an
talked
to
when
she
was
lyin
there
my
eye
chuckling

but
arter
a
bit
they

montaubyn
does

as
cheerin
as

an
last
longer
is
it
a
kind
of
religion
dart
asked
having
a
vague
memory
of
rumors
of
fantastic
new
theories
and
beliefs
which
had
seemed
to
him
weird
visions
floating
through
fagged
brains
wearied
by
old
doubts
and
arguments
and
failures
the
world
was
tired
the
whole
earth
was
sad
centuries
had
wrought
only
to
the
end
of
this
twentieth
despair
was
the
struggle
waking
even
here
in
this
back
water
of
the
huge
city
human
tide
he
wondered
with
dull
interest
is
it
a
kind
of
religion
he
said
it
cheerfler
glad
thrust
out
her
sharp
chin
uncertainly
again
there
no
fire
in
it
an
there
ai
no
blime
laid
on
godamighty
the
word
as
she
uttered
it
seemed
to
have
no
connection
whatever
with
her
usual
colloquial
invocation
of
the
deity
when
a
dray
run
over
little
billy
an
crushed
inter

dart
hid
his
own
face
after
the
manner
of
the
wretched
curate
no
wonder
he
groaned
his
blood
turned
cold
but
said
glad

up

they
can
make
some
more
tea
an
drink
it
it
ended
in
their
going
out
of
the
room
together
again
and
stumbling
once
more
down
the
stairway
crookedness
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
short
flight
they
stopped
in
the
darkness
and
glad
knocked
at
a
door
with
a
summons
manifestly
expectant
of
cheerful
welcome
she
used
the
formula
she
had
used
before
me
miss
montaubyn
she
cried
out
glad
the
door
opened
in
wide
welcome
and
confronting
them
as
she
held
its
handle
stood
a
small
old
woman
with
an
astonishing
face
it
was
astonishing
because
while
it
was
withered
and
wrinkled
with
marks
of
past
years
which
had
once
stamped
their
reckless
unsavoriness
upon
its
every
line
some
strange
redeeming
thing
had
happened
to
it
and
its
expression
was
that
of
a
creature
to
whom
the
opening
of
a
door
could
only
mean
the
entrance
the
tumbling
in
as
it
were
of
hopes
realized
its
surface
was
swept
clean
of
even
the
vaguest
anticipation
of
anything
not
to
be
desired
smiling
as
it
did
through
the
black
doorway
into
the
unrelieved
shadow
of
the
passage
it
struck
antony
dart
at
once
that
it
actually
implied
this
and
that
in
this
place
and
indeed
in
any
place
nothing
could
have
been
more
astonishing
what
could
indeed
well
well
she
said
come
in
glad
bless
yer
i
brought
a
gent
to
yer
talk
a
bit
glad
explained
informally
the
small
old
woman
raised
her
twinkling
old
face
to
look
at
him
ah
she
said
as
if
summing
up
what
was
before
her
thinks
worse
than
it
is
does
now
come
in
sir
do
this
time
it
struck
dart
that
her
look
seemed
actually
to
anticipate
the
evolving
of
some
wonderful
and
desirable
thing
from
himself
as
if
even
his
gloom
carried
with
it
treasure
as
yet
undisplayed
as
she
knew
nothing
of
the
ten
sovereigns
he
wondered
what
in
god
name
she
saw
the
poverty
of
the
little
square
room
had
an
odd
cheer
in
it
much
scrubbing
had
removed
from
it
the
objections
manifest
in
glad
room
above
there
was
a
small
red
fire
in
the
grate
a
strip
of
old
but
gay
carpet
before
it
two
chairs
and
a
table
were
covered
with
a
harlequin
patchwork
made
of
bright
odds
and
ends
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
the
fog
in
all
its
murky
volume
could
not
quite
obscure
the
brightness
of
the
often
rubbed
window
and
its
harlequin
curtain
drawn
across
upon
a
string
bless
yer
said
miss
montaubyn
sit
down
dart
sat
and
thanked
her
glad
dropped
upon
the
floor
and
girdled
her
knees
comfortably
while
miss
montaubyn
took
the
second
chair
which
was
close
to
the
table
and
snuffed
the
candle
which
stood
near
a
basket
of
colored
scraps

as

harlequin
curtain

and
staring
at

floor

was
another
phase
of
the
dream

i
ses
as
breaks
old
women

an
crushes
babies
under

so
as

glad
answered
for
her
with
a
tremulous
yes

was
a
tremulous
giggle
a
weirdly
moved
little
sound
when
she
wakes
in
the
mornin
she
ses
to

to
come
cheerfle

when
there
a
knock
at

an
then
she
does
wotever
next
comes
into
mind
an
she
says
it
allus
the
right
answer
sometimes
sheepishly
i
tried
it
myself
true
i
did
it
this
mornin
when
i
sat
down
an
pulled
me
sack
over
me
on
the
bridge
polly
been
cryin
so
loud
all
night
i
got
a
bit
low
in
me
stummick
an
she
stopped
suddenly
and
turned
on
dart
as
if
light
had
flashed
across
her
mind
dunno
nothin
about
it
she
stammered
but
i
said
it
just
like
she
does
an
you
come
plainly
she
had
uttered
whatever
words
she
had
used
in
the
form
of
a
sort
of
incantation
and
here
was
the
result
in
the
living
body
of
this
man
sitting
before
her
she
stared
hard
at
him
repeating
her
words
you
come
yes
you
did
it
was
the
answer
said
miss
montaubyn
with
entire
simplicity
as
she
bit
off
her
thread
that
wot
it
was
antony
dart
lifted
his
heavy
head
you
believe
it
he
said
i
livin
on
believin
it
she
said
confidingly
i
ai
got
nothin
else
an
answers
keeps
comin
and
comin
what
answers
bits
o
work
an
things
as
glad
there
she
one
aw
said
glad
i
ai
nothin
i
likes
to
yer
tell
about
it
she
ses
to
dart
again
a
little
slowly
as
she
watched
his
face
with
curiously
questioning
eyes
she
ses
in
the
room
same
as
everywhere
in
this
room
sometimes
she
talks
out
loud
to
what
cried
dart
startled
again
the
strange
majestic
awful
idea
the
deity
of
the
ages
to
be
spoken
of
as
a
mere
unfeared
reality
and
even
as
the
vaguely
formed
thought
sprang
in
his
brain
he
started
once
more
suddenly
confronted
by
the
meaning
his
sense
of
shock
implied
what
had
all
the
sermons
of
all
the
centuries
been
preaching
but
that
it
was
reality
what
had
all
the
infidels
of
every
age
contended
but
that
it
was
unreal
and
the
folly
of
a
dream
he
had
never
thought
of
himself
as
an
infidel
perhaps
it
would
have
shocked
him
to
be
called
one
though
he
was
not
quite
sure
but
that
a
little
superannuated
dancer
at
battered
and
worn
by
an
unlawful
life
should
sit
and
smile
in
absolute
faith
at
such
a
a
superstition
as
this
stirred
something
like
awe
in
him
for
she
was
smiling
in
entire
acquiescence
it
what
the
curick
ses
she
enlarged
radiantly
though
don
t
believe
it
pore
young
man
thinks
does
for
low

me
as
well
as

listening
i
am
doing
it
because
here
is
a
creature
who
believes
knowing
no
doctrine
knowing
no
church
she
believes
she
thinks
she
knows
her
deity
is
by
her
side
she
is
not
afraid
to
her
simpleness
the
awful
unknown
is
the
known
and
with
her
suppose
it
were
true
he
uttered
aloud
in
response
to
a
sense
of
inward
tremor
suppose
it
were
true
and
he
was
not
speaking
either
to
the
woman
or
the
girl
and
his
forehead
was
damp
gawd
said
glad
her
chin
almost
on
her
knees
her
eyes
staring
fearsomely
it
was
an
us
sittin
an
not

of

there
was
no
lights
nor
no
nothin
onct
nobody
knowed
an
all
the
sime
it
was
there
jest
waitin
her
fantastic
laugh
ended
for
her
with
a
little
choking
vaguely
hysteric
sound
blimme
she
said
ai
it
queer
us
not
knowin
if
it
true
antony
dart
bent
forward
in
his
chair
he
looked
far
into
the
eyes
of
the
as
if
some
unseen
thing
within
them
might
answer
him
miss
montaubyn
herself
for
the
moment
he
did
not
see
what
he
stammered
hoarsely
his
voice
broken
with
awe
what
of

was
a
strange
place
but
something
was
here
magic
was
it
frenzy
dreams
what
he
heard
from
below
a
sudden
murmur
and
crying
out
in
the
street
miss
montaubyn
heard
it
and
stopped
in
her
sewing
holding
her
needle
and
thread
extended
glad
heard
it
and
sprang
to
her
feet
somethin
she
cried
out
someone
she
was
out
of
the
room
in
a
breath
space
she
stood
outside
listening
a
few
seconds
and
darted
back
to
the
open
door
speaking
through
it
they
could
hear
below
commotion
exclamations
the
wail
of
a
child
somethin
to
bet
she
cried
out
again
i
can
the
child
she
was
gone
and
flying
down
the
staircase
antony
dart
and
miss
montaubyn
rose
together
the
tumult
was
increasing
people
were
running
about
in
the
court
and
it
was
plain
a
crowd
was
forming
by
the
magic
which
calls
up
crowds
as
from
nowhere
about
the
door
the
screams
rose
shrill
above
the
noise
it
was
no
small
thing
which
had
occurred
i
must
go
said
miss
montaubyn
limping
away
from
her
table
i
can
you
can
too
as
he
followed
her
they
were
met
by
glad
at
the
threshold
she
had
shot
back
to
them
panting
she
was
blind
drunk
she
said
an
she
went
out
to
get
more
she
tried
to
cross
the
street
an
fell
under
a
car
she
be
dead
in
five
minits
i
goin
for
the
biby
dart
saw
miss
montaubyn
step
back
into
her
room
he
turned
involuntarily
to
look
at
her
she
stood
still
a
second
so
still
that
it
seemed
as
if
she
was
not
drawing
mortal
breath
her
astonishing
expectant
eyes
closed
themselves
and
yet
in
closing
spoke
expectancy
still
speak
lord
she
said
softly
but
as
if
she
spoke
to
something
whose
nearness
to
her
was
such
that
her
hand
might
have
touched
it
speak
lord
thy
servant
antony
dart
almost
felt
his
hair
rise
he
quaked
as
she
came
near
her
poor
clothes
brushing
against
him
he
drew
back
to
let
her
pass
first
and
followed
her
leading
the
court
was
filled
with
men
women
and
children
who
surged
about
the
doorway
talking
crying
and
protesting
against
each
other
crowding
dart
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
policeman
fighting
his
way
through
with
a
doctor
a
dishevelled
woman
with
a
child
at
her
dirty
bare
breast
had
got
in
and
was
talking
loudly
just
outside
the
court
it
was
she
proclaimed
an
i
saw
it
if
she
bin
it
could
time
for
ses
i
she
not
twenty
breaths
to
dror
let
die
in
own
bed
pore
thing
and
both
she
and
her
baby
breaking
into
wails
at
one
and
the
same
time
other
women
some
hysteric
some
maudlin
with
gin
joined
them
in
a
terrified
outburst
get
out
you
women
commanded
the
doctor
who
had
forced
his
way
across
the
threshold
send
them
away
officer
to
the
policeman
there
were
others
to
turn
out
of
the
room
itself
which
was
crowded
with
morbid
or
terrified
creatures
all
making
for
confusion
glad
had
seized
the
child
and
was
forcing
her
way
out
into
such
air
as
there
was
outside
the
bed
a
strange
and
loathly
thing
stood
by
the
empty
rusty
fireplace
drunken
bet
lay
on
it
a
bundle
of
clothing
over
which
the
doctor
bent
for
but
a
few
minutes
before
he
turned
away
antony
dart
standing
near
the
door
heard
miss
montaubyn
speak
to
him
in
a
whisper
may
i
go
to
and
the
doctor
nodded
she
limped
lightly
forward
and
her
small
face
was
white
but
expectant
still
what
could
she
expect
now
o
lord
what
an
extraordinary
thing
happened
an
abnormal
silence
fell
the
owners
of
such
faces
as
on
stretched
necks
caught
sight
of
her
seemed
in
a
flash
to
communicate
with
others
in
the
crowd
jinny
montaubyn
someone
whispered
and
jinny
montaubyn
was
passed
along
leaving
an
awed
stirring
in
its
wake
those
whom
the
pressure
outside
had
crushed
against
the
wall
near
the
window
in
a
passionate
hurry
breathed
on
and
rubbed
the
panes
that
they
might
lay
their
faces
to
them
one
tore
out
the
rags
stuffed
in
a
broken
place
and
listened
breathlessly
jinny
montaubyn
was
kneeling
down
and
laying
her
small
old
hand
on
the
muddied
forehead
she
held
it
there
a
second
or
so
and
spoke
in
a
voice
whose
low
clearness
brought
back
at
once
to
dart
the
voice
in
which
she
had
spoken
to
the
something
upstairs
bet
she
said
bet
and
then
more
soft
still
and
yet
more
clear
bet
my
dear
it
seemed
incredible
but
it
was
a
fact
slowly
the
lids
of
the
eyes
lifted
and
the
pupils
fixed
themselves
on
jinny
montaubyn
who
leaned
still
closer
and
spoke
again
ai
true
she
said
not
this
ai
true
there
is
no
death
slow
and
soft
but
passionately
distinct
there
is
no
death
the
muscles
of
the
woman
face
twisted
it
into
a
rueful
smile
the
three
words
she
dragged
out
were
so
faint
that
perhaps
none
but
strained
ears
heard
them
wot
price
me
the
soul
of
her
was
loosening
fast
and
straining
away
but
jinny
montaubyn
followed
it
there
is
no
death
and
her
low
voice
had
the
tone
of
a
slender
silver
trumpet
in
a
minit
yer
know
in
a
minit
lord
lifting
her
expectant
face
show
her
the
wye
mysteriously
the
clouds
were
clearing
from
the
sodden
face
mysteriously
miss
montaubyn
watched
them
as
they
were
swept
away
a
minute
two
minutes
and
they
were
gone
then
she
rose
noiselessly
and
stood
looking
down
speaking
quite
simply
as
if
to
herself
ah
she
breathed
she
does
know
now
fer
sure
an
certain
then
antony
dart
turning
slightly
realized
that
a
man
who
had
entered
the
house
and
been
standing
near
him
breathing
with
light
quickness
since
the
moment
miss
montaubyn
had
knelt
was
plainly
the
person
glad
had
called
the
curick
and
that
he
had
bowed
his
head
and
covered
his
eyes
with
a
hand
which
trembled
iv
he
was
a
young
man
with
an
eager
soul
and
his
work
in
apple
blossom
court
and
places
like
it
had
torn
him
many
ways
religious
conventions
established
through
centuries
of
custom
had
not
prepared
him
for
life
among
the
submerged
he
had
struggled
and
been
appalled
he
had
wrestled
in
prayer
and
felt
himself
unanswered
and
in
repentance
of
the
feeling
had
scourged
himself
with
thorns
miss
montaubyn
returning
from
the
hospital
had
filled
him
at
first
with
horror
and
protest
but
who
knows
who
knows
he
said
to
dart
as
they
stood
and
talked
together
afterward
faith
as
a
little
child
that
is
literally
hers
and
i
was
shocked
by
it
and
tried
to
destroy
it
until
i
suddenly
saw
what
i
was
doing
i
was
in
my
cloddish
egotism
trying
to
show
her
that
she
was
irreverent
because
she
could
believe
what
in
my
soul
i
do
not
though
i
dare
not
admit
so
much
even
to
myself
she
took
from
some
strange
passing
visitor
to
her
tortured
bedside
what
was
to
her
a
revelation
she
heard
it
first
as
a
child
hears
a
story
of
magic
when
she
came
out
of
the
hospital
she
told
it
as
if
it
was
one
i
i
he
bit
his
lips
and
moistened
them
argued
with
her
and
reproached
her
christ
the
merciful
forgive
me
she
sat
in
her
squalid
little
room
with
her
magic
sometimes
in
the
dark
sometimes
without
fire
and
she
clung
to
it
and
loved
it
and
asked
it
to
help
her
as
a
child
asks
its
father
for
bread
when
she
was
answered
and
god
forgive
me
again
for
doubting
that
the
simple
good
that
came
to
her
was
an
answer
when
any
small
help
came
to
her
she
was
a
radiant
thing
and
without
a
shadow
of
doubt
in
her
eyes
told
me
of
it
as
proof
proof
that
she
had
been
heard
when
things
went
wrong
for
a
day
and
the
fire
was
out
again
and
the
room
dark
she
said
kept
near
enough
i
trusted
true
it
will
be
gave
me
soon
and
when
once
at
such
a
time
i
said
to
her
must
learn
to
say
thy
will
be
done
she
smiled
up
at
me
like
a
happy
baby
and
answered
will
be
done
on
earth
as
it
is
in
lor
there
no
cold
there
nor
no
nor
no
cryin
nor
pain
that
the
way
the
will
is
done
in
that
wot
i
arst
for
all
day
long
for
it
to
be
done
on
earth
as
it
is
in
what
could
i
say
could
i
tell
her
that
the
will
of
the
deity
on
the
earth
he
created
was
only
the
will
to
do
evil
to
give
pain
to
crush
the
creature
made
in
his
own
image
what
else
do
we
mean
when
we
say
under
all
horror
and
agony
that
befalls
is
god
will
god
will
be
done
base
unbeliever
though
i
am
i
could
not
speak
the
words
oh
she
has
something
we
have
not
her
poor
little
misspent
life
has
changed
itself
into
a
shining
thing
though
it
shines
and
glows
only
in
this
hideous
place
she
herself
does
not
know
of
its
shining
but
drunken
bet
would
stagger
up
to
her
room
and
ask
to
be
told
what
she
called
her
stories
i
have
seen
her
there
sitting
listening
listening
with
strange
quiet
on
her
and
dull
yearning
in
her
sodden
eyes
so
would
other
and
worse
women
go
to
her
and
i
who
had
struggled
with
them
could
see
that
she
had
reached
some
remote
longing
in
their
beings
which
i
had
never
touched
in
time
the
seed
would
have
stirred
to
life
it
is
beginning
to
stir
even
now
during
the
months
since
she
came
back
to
the
court
though
they
have
laughed
at
her
both
men
and
women
have
begun
to
see
her
as
a
creature
weirdly
set
apart
most
of
them
feel
something
like
awe
of
her
they
half
believe
her
prayers
to
be
bewitchments
but
they
want
them
on
their
side
they
have
never
wanted
mine
that
i
have
known
known
she
believes
that
her
deity
is
in
apple
blossom
court
in
the
dire
holes
its
people
live
in
on
the
broken
stairway
in
every
nook
and
awful
cranny
of
it
a
great
glory
we
will
not
see
only
waiting
to
be
called
and
to
answer
do
believe
it
do
you
do
any
of
those
anointed
of
us
who
preach
each
day
so
glibly
is
everywhere
who
is
the
one
who
believes
if
there
were
such
a
man
he
would
go
about
as
moses
did
when
wist
not
that
his
face
shone
they
had
gone
out
together
and
were
standing
in
the
fog
in
the
court
the
curate
removed
his
hat
and
passed
his
handkerchief
over
his
damp
forehead
his
breath
coming
and
going
almost
sobbingly
his
eyes
staring
straight
before
him
into
the
yellowness
of
the
haze
who
he
said
after
a
moment
of
singular
silence
who
are
you
antony
dart
hesitated
a
few
seconds
and
at
the
end
of
his
pause
he
put
his
hand
into
his
overcoat
pocket
if
you
will
come
upstairs
with
me
to
the
room
where
the
girl
glad
lives
i
will
tell
you
he
said
but
before
we
go
i
want
to
hand
something
over
to
you
the
curate
turned
an
amazed
gaze
upon
him
what
is
it
he
asked
dart
withdrew
his
hand
from
his
pocket
and
the
pistol
was
in
it
i
came
out
this
morning
to
buy
this
he
said
i
intended
never
mind
what
i
intended
a
wrong
turn
taken
in
the
fog
brought
me
here
take
this
thing
from
me
and
keep
it
the
curate
took
the
pistol
and
put
it
into
his
own
pocket
without
comment
in
the
course
of
his
labors
he
had
seen
desperate
men
and
desperate
things
many
times
he
had
even
been
at
moments
a
desperate
man
thinking
desperate
things
himself
though
no
human
being
had
ever
suspected
the
fact
this
man
had
faced
some
tragedy
he
could
see
had
he
been
on
the
verge
of
a
crime
had
he
looked
murder
in
the
eyes
what
had
made
him
pause
was
it
possible
that
the
dream
of
jinny
montaubyn
being
in
the
air
had
reached
his
brain
his
being
he
looked
almost
appealingly
at
him
but
he
only
said
aloud
let
us
go
upstairs
then
so
they
went
as
they
passed
the
door
of
the
room
where
the
dead
woman
lay
dart
went
in
and
spoke
to
miss
montaubyn
who
was
still
there
if
there
are
things
wanted
here
he
said
this
will
buy
them
and
he
put
some
money
into
her
hand
she
did
not
seem
surprised
at
the
incongruity
of
his
shabbiness
producing
money
well
now
she
said
i
was
wonderin
an
askin
i
like
clean
an
nice
an
there
milk
wanted
bad
for
the
biby
in
the
room
they
mounted
to
glad
was
trying
to
feed
the
child
with
bread
softened
in
tea
polly
sat
near
her
looking
on
with
restless
eager
eyes
she
had
never
seen
anything
of
her
own
baby
but
its
limp
newborn
and
dead
body
being
carried
away
out
of
sight
she
had
not
even
dared
to
ask
what
was
done
with
such
poor
little
carrion
the
tyranny
of
the
law
of
life
made
her
want
to
paw
and
touch
this
lately
born
thing
as
her
agony
had
given
her
no
fruit
of
her
own
body
to
touch
and
paw
and
nuzzle
and
caress
as
mother
creatures
will
whether
they
be
women
or
tigresses
or
doves
or
female
cats
let
me
hold
her
glad
she
half
whimpered
when
she
fed
let
me
get
her
to
sleep
all
right
glad
answered
we
could
look
after
between
us
well
enough
the
thief
was
still
sitting
on
the
hearth
but
being
full
fed
and
comfortable
for
the
first
time
in
many
a
day
he
had
rested
his
head
against
the
wall
and
fallen
into
profound
sleep
wot
up
said
glad
when
the
two
men
came
in
is
i
have
come
up
here
to
tell
you
something
dart
answered
let
us
sit
down
again
round
the
fire
it
will
take
a
little
time
glad
with
eager
eyes
on
him
handed
the
child
to
polly
and
sat
down
without
a
moment
hesitance
avid
of
what
was
to
come
she
nudged
the
thief
with
friendly
elbow
and
he
started
up
awake
got
somethin
to
tell
us
she
explained
the
curick
come
up
to
it
too
sit
polly
with
elbow
jerk
toward
the
bundle
of
sacks
it
got
its
stummick
full
an
it
go
to
sleep
fast
enough
so
they
sat
again
in
the
weird
circle
neither
the
strangeness
of
the
group
nor
the
squalor
of
the
hearth
were
of
a
nature
to
be
new
things
to
the
curate
his
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
dart
face
as
did
the
eyes
of
the
thief
the
beggar
and
the
young
thing
of
the
street
no
one
glanced
away
from
him
his
telling
of
his
story
was
almost
monotonous
in
its
quietness
of
tone
the
strangeness
to
himself
though
it
was
a
strangeness
he
accepted
absolutely
without
protest
lay
in
his
telling
it
at
all
and
in
a
sense
of
his
knowledge
that
each
of
these
creatures
would
understand
and
mysteriously
know
what
depths
he
had
touched
this
day
just
before
i
left
my
lodgings
this
morning
he
said
i
found
myself
standing
in
the
middle
of
my
room
and
speaking
to
something
aloud
i
did
not
know
i
was
going
to
speak
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
speaking
to
i
heard
my
own
voice
cry
out
in
agony
lord
what
shall
i
do
to
be
saved
the
curate
made
a
sudden
movement
in
his
place
and
his
sallow
young
face
flushed
but
he
said
nothing
glad
small
and
sharp
countenance
became
curious
lord
thy
servant
she
quoted
tentatively
no
answered
dart
it
was
not
like
that
i
had
never
thought
of
such
things
i
believed
nothing
i
was
going
out
to
buy
a
pistol
and
when
i
returned
intended
to
blow
my
brains
out
why
asked
glad
with
passionately
intent
eyes
why
because
i
was
worn
out
and
done
for
and
all
the
world
seemed
worn
out
and
done
for
and
among
other
things
i
believed
i
was
beginning
slowly
to
go
mad
from
the
thief
there
burst
forth
a
low
groan
and
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
i
been
there
he
said
i
near
there
now
dart
took
up
speech
again
there
was
no
answer
none
as
i
stood
waiting
god
knows
for
what
the
dead
stillness
of
the
room
was
like
the
dead
stillness
of
the
grave
and
i
went
out
saying
to
my
soul
is
what
happens
to
the
fool
who
cries
aloud
in
his
pain
i
cried
aloud
said
the
thief
and
sometimes
it
seemed
as
if
an
answer
was
coming
but
i
always
knew
it
never
would
in
a
tortured
voice
ai
fair
to
arst
that
wye
glad
put
in
with
shrewd
logic
miss
montaubyn
she
allers
knows
it
will
come
an
it
does
something
not
myself
turned
my
feet
toward
this
place
said
dart
i
was
thrust
from
one
thing
to
another
i
was
forced
to
see
and
hear
things
close
at
hand
it
has
been
as
if
i
was
under
a
spell
the
woman
in
the
room
below
the
woman
lying
dead
he
stopped
a
second
and
then
went
on
there
is
too
much
that
is
crying
out
aloud
a
man
such
as
i
am
it
has
forced
itself
upon
me
can
not
leave
such
things
and
give
himself
to
the
dust
i
can
not
explain
clearly
because
i
am
not
thinking
as
i
am
accustomed
to
think
a
change
has
come
upon
me
i
shall
not
use
the
pistol
as
i
meant
to
use
it
glad
made
a
friendly
clutch
at
the
sleeve
of
his
shabby
coat
right
o
she
cried
that
it
you
buck
up
sime
as
i
told
yer
ai
stony
broke
an
there
antony
dart
expression
was
weirdly
retrospective
i
did
not
think
so
this
morning
he
answered
but
there
is
said
the
girl
ai
there
now
curick
there

lot
o
work
in
yer
yet
yer
could
do
all
sorts
o
things
if
y
ai
too
proud
i
yer
so
the
curick
y
ai
found
out
yet
what
a
little
folks
can
live
on
till
luck
turns
me
i
goin
to
try
miss
montaubyn
wye
le
both
try
le
believe
things
is
comin
get
to
talk
to
us
some
more
the
curate
was
thinking
the
thing
over
deeply
yer
see
glad
enlarged
cheerfully
yer
look
almost
like
a
gentleman
yer
can
write
a
good
an
spell
all
right
can
yer
yes
i
think
perhaps
the
curate
began
reflectively
particularly
if
you
can
write
well
i
might
be
able
to
get
you
some
work
i
do
not
want
work
dart
answered
slowly
at
least
i
do
not
want
the
kind
you
would
be
likely
to
offer
me
the
curate
felt
a
shock
as
if
cold
water
had
been
dashed
over
him
somehow
it
had
not
once
occurred
to
him
that
the
man
could
be
one
of
the
educated
degenerate
vicious
for
whom
no
power
to
help
lay
in
any
hands
yet
he
was
not
the
common
vagrant
and
he
was
plainly
on
the
point
of
producing
an
excuse
for
refusing
work
the
other
man
seeing
his
start
and
his
amazed
troubled
flush
put
out
a
hand
and
touched
his
arm
apologetically
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
one
of
the
things
i
was
going
to
tell
you
i
had
not
finished
was
that
i
am
what
is
called
a
gentleman
i
am
also
what
the
world
knows
as
a
rich
man
i
am
sir
oliver
holt
each
member
of
the
party
gazed
at
him
aghast
it
was
an
enormous
name
to
claim
even
the
two
female
creatures
knew
what
it
stood
for
it
was
the
name
which
represented
the
greatest
wealth
and
power
in
the
world
of
finance
and
schemes
of
business
it
stood
for
financial
influence
which
could
change
the
face
of
national
fortunes
and
bring
about
crises
it
was
known
throughout
the
world
yesterday
the
newspaper
rumor
that
its
owner
had
mysteriously
left
england
had
caused
men
on
to
discuss
possibilities
together
with
lowered
voices
glad
stared
at
the
curate
for
the
first
time
she
looked
disturbed
and
alarmed
blimme
she
ejaculated
gone
off
nut
pore
chap
gone
off
it
no
the
man
answered
you
shall
come
to
me
he
hesitated
a
second
while
a
shade
passed
over
his
eyes
and
you
shall
see
he
rose
quietly
to
his
feet
and
the
curate
rose
also
abnormal
as
the
climax
was
it
was
to
be
seen
that
there
was
no
mistake
about
the
revelation
the
man
was
a
creature
of
authority
and
used
to
carrying
conviction
by
his
unsupported
word
that
made
itself
by
some
clear
unspoken
method
plain
you
are
sir
oliver
holt
and
a
few
hours
ago
you
were
on
the
point
of
ending
it
all
in
an
obscure
lodging
afterward
the
earth
would
have
been
shovelled
on
to
a
coffin
it
was
an
awful
thing
he
shook
off
a
passionate
shudder
there
was
no
wealth
on
earth
that
could
give
me
a
moment
ease
sleep
hope
life
the
whole
world
was
full
of
things
i
loathed
the
sight
and
thought
of
the
doctors
said
my
condition
was
physical
perhaps
it
was
perhaps
has
strangely
given
a
healthful
jolt
to
my
nerves
perhaps
i
have
been
dragged
away
from
the
agony
of
morbidity
and
plunged
into
new
intense
emotions
which
have
saved
me
from
the
last
thing
and
the
worst
saved
me
he
stopped
suddenly
and
his
face
flushed
and
then
quite
slowly
turned
pale
saved
me
he
repeated
the
words
as
the
curate
saw
the
awed
blood
creepingly
recede
who
knows
who
knows
how
many
explanations
one
is
ready
to
give
before
one
thinks
of
what
we
say
we
believe
perhaps
it
was
the
answer
the
curate
bowed
his
head
reverently
perhaps
it
was
the
girl
glad
sat
clinging
to
her
knees
her
eyes
wide
and
awed
and
with
a
sudden
gush
of
hysteric
tears
rushing
down
her
cheeks
that
the
wye
that
the
wye
she
gulped
out
no
one
never
believe
they
wo
never
that
what
she
sees
miss
montaubyn
you
do
do
with
a
jerk
toward
the
curate
i
ai
but
me
but
blimme
if
i
do
blimme
sir
oliver
holt
grew
paler
still
he
felt
as
he
had
done
when
jinny
montaubyn
poor
dress
swept
against
him
his
voice
shook
when
he
spoke
so
do
i
he
said
with
a
sudden
deep
catch
of
the
breath
it
was
the
answer
in
a
few
moments
more
he
went
to
the
girl
polly
and
laid
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
i
shall
take
you
home
to
your
mother
he
said
i
shall
take
you
myself
and
care
for
you
both
she
shall
know
nothing
you
are
afraid
of
her
hearing
i
shall
ask
her
to
bring
up
the
child
you
will
help
her
then
he
touched
the
thief
who
got
up
white
and
shaking
and
with
eyes
moist
with
excitement
you
shall
never
see
another
man
claim
your
thought
because
you
have
not
time
or
money
to
work
it
out
you
will
go
with
me
there
are
enough
for
you
glad
still
sat
clinging
to
her
knees
and
with
tears
running
but
the
ugliness
of
her
sharp
small
face
was
a
thing
an
angel
might
have
paused
to
see
you
do
want
to
go
away
from
here
sir
oliver
said
to
her
and
she
shook
her
head
no
not
me
i
told
yer
wot
i
wanted
lem
me
do
it
you
shall
he
answered
and
i
will
help
you
the
things
which
developed
in
apple
blossom
court
later
the
things
which
came
to
each
of
those
who
had
sat
in
the
weird
circle
round
the
fire
the
revelations
of
new
existence
which
came
to
herself
aroused
no
amazement
in
jinny
montaubyn
mind
she
had
asked
and
believed
all
things
and
all
this
was
but
another
of
the
answers
