chapter
one
may
as
well
begin
with
helen
letters
to
her
sister
howards
end
tuesday
dearest
meg
it
is
going
to
be
what
we
expected
it
is
old
and
little
and
altogether
delightful
red
brick
we
can
scarcely
pack
in
as
it
is
and
the
dear
knows
what
will
happen
when
paul
younger
son
arrives
tomorrow
from
hall
you
go
right
or
left
into
or
hall
itself
is
practically
a
room
you
open
another
door
in
it
and
there
are
the
stairs
going
up
in
a
sort
of
tunnel
to
the
three
bedrooms
in
a
row
there
and
three
attics
in
a
row
above
that
is
all
the
house
really
but
it
all
that
one
notices
nine
windows
as
you
look
up
from
the
front
garden
then
there
a
very
big
to
the
left
as
you
look
up
leaning
a
little
over
the
house
and
standing
on
the
boundary
between
the
garden
and
meadow
i
quite
love
that
tree
already
also
ordinary
elms
oaks
no
nastier
than
ordinary
oaks
and
a
vine
no
silver
birches
though
however
i
must
get
on
to
my
host
and
hostess
i
only
wanted
to
show
that
it
is
the
least
what
we
expected
why
did
we
settle
that
their
house
would
be
all
gables
and
wiggles
and
their
garden
all
paths
i
believe
simply
because
we
associate
them
with
expensive
hotels
wilcox
trailing
in
beautiful
dresses
down
long
corridors
wilcox
bullying
porters
etc
we
females
are
that
unjust
i
shall
be
back
saturday
will
let
you
know
train
later
they
are
as
angry
as
i
am
that
you
did
not
come
too
really
tibby
is
too
tiresome
he
starts
a
new
mortal
disease
every
month
how
could
he
have
got
hay
fever
in
london
and
even
if
he
could
it
seems
hard
that
you
should
give
up
a
visit
to
hear
a
schoolboy
sneeze
tell
him
that
charles
wilcox
the
son
who
is
here
has
hay
fever
too
but
brave
and
gets
quite
cross
when
we
inquire
after
it
men
like
the
wilcoxes
would
do
tibby
a
power
of
good
but
you
wo
agree
and
i
better
change
the
subject
this
long
letter
is
because
i
writing
before
breakfast
oh
the
beautiful
vine
leaves
the
house
is
covered
with
a
vine
i
looked
out
earlier
and
wilcox
was
already
in
the
garden
she
evidently
loves
it
no
wonder
she
sometimes
looks
tired
she
was
watching
the
large
red
poppies
come
out
then
she
walked
off
the
lawn
to
the
meadow
whose
corner
to
the
right
i
can
just
see
trail
trail
went
her
long
dress
over
the
sopping
grass
and
she
came
back
with
her
hands
full
of
the
hay
that
was
cut
yesterday
i
suppose
for
rabbits
or
something
as
she
kept
on
smelling
it
the
air
here
is
delicious
later
on
i
heard
the
noise
of
croquet
balls
and
looked
out
again
and
it
was
charles
wilcox
practising
they
are
keen
on
all
games
presently
he
started
sneezing
and
had
to
stop
then
i
hear
more
clicketing
and
it
is
wilcox
practising
and
then
he
has
to
stop
too
then
evie
comes
out
and
does
some
calisthenic
exercises
on
a
machine
that
is
tacked
on
to
a
they
put
everything
to
use
and
then
she
says
and
in
she
goes
and
finally
wilcox
reappears
trail
trail
still
smelling
hay
and
looking
at
the
flowers
i
inflict
all
this
on
you
because
once
you
said
that
life
is
sometimes
life
and
sometimes
only
a
drama
and
one
must
learn
to
distinguish
from
which
and
up
to
now
i
have
always
put
that
down
as
clever
nonsense
but
this
morning
it
really
does
seem
not
life
but
a
play
and
it
did
amuse
me
enormously
to
watch
the
w
now
wilcox
has
come
in
i
am
going
to
wear
omission
last
night
wilcox
wore
an
omission
and
evie
omission
so
it
exactly
a
place
and
if
you
shut
your
eyes
it
still
seems
the
wiggly
hotel
that
we
expected
not
if
you
open
them
the
are
too
sweet
there
is
a
great
hedge
of
them
over
the
lawn
magnificently
tall
so
that
they
fall
down
in
garlands
and
nice
and
thin
at
the
bottom
so
that
you
can
see
ducks
through
it
and
a
cow
these
belong
to
the
farm
which
is
the
only
house
near
us
there
goes
the
breakfast
gong
much
love
modified
love
to
tibby
love
to
aunt
juley
how
good
of
her
to
come
and
keep
you
company
but
what
a
bore
burn
this
will
write
again
thursday
helen
howards
end
friday
dearest
meg
i
am
having
a
glorious
time
i
like
them
all
wilcox
if
quieter
than
in
germany
is
sweeter
than
ever
and
i
never
saw
anything
like
her
steady
unselfishness
and
the
best
of
it
is
that
the
others
do
not
take
advantage
of
her
they
are
the
very
happiest
jolliest
family
that
you
can
imagine
i
do
really
feel
that
we
are
making
friends
the
fun
of
it
is
that
they
think
me
a
noodle
and
say
so
at
least
wilcox
does
and
when
that
happens
and
one
does
mind
it
a
pretty
sure
test
is
it
he
says
the
most
horrid
things
about
women
suffrage
so
nicely
and
when
i
said
i
believed
in
equality
he
just
folded
his
arms
and
gave
me
such
a
setting
down
as
i
never
had
meg
shall
we
ever
learn
to
talk
less
i
never
felt
so
ashamed
of
myself
in
my
life
i
could
point
to
a
time
when
men
had
been
equal
nor
even
to
a
time
when
the
wish
to
be
equal
had
made
them
happier
in
other
ways
i
could
say
a
word
i
had
just
picked
up
the
notion
that
equality
is
good
from
some
book
probably
from
poetry
or
you
anyhow
been
knocked
into
pieces
and
like
all
people
who
are
really
strong
wilcox
did
it
without
hurting
me
on
the
other
hand
i
laugh
at
them
for
catching
hay
fever
we
live
like
and
charles
takes
us
out
every
day
in
the
motor
a
tomb
with
trees
in
it
a
hermit
house
a
wonderful
road
that
was
made
by
the
kings
of
mercia
tennis
a
cricket
match
bridge
and
at
night
we
squeeze
up
in
this
lovely
house
the
whole
clan
here
now
it
like
a
rabbit
warren
evie
is
a
dear
they
want
me
to
stop
over
sunday
i
suppose
it
wo
matter
if
i
do
marvellous
weather
and
the
view
marvellous
views
westward
to
the
high
ground
thank
you
for
your
letter
burn
this
your
affectionate
helen
howards
end
sunday
dearest
dearest
meg
i
do
not
know
what
you
will
say
paul
and
i
are
in
love
the
younger
son
who
only
came
here
wednesday
chapter
margaret
glanced
at
her
sister
note
and
pushed
it
over
the
to
her
aunt
there
was
a
moment
hush
and
then
the
opened
i
can
tell
you
nothing
aunt
juley
i
know
no
more
than
you
do
we
met
we
only
met
the
father
and
mother
abroad
last
spring
i
know
so
little
that
i
did
even
know
their
son
name
it
all
so
she
waved
her
hand
and
laughed
a
little
in
that
case
it
is
far
too
sudden
who
knows
aunt
juley
who
knows
but
margaret
dear
i
mean
we
must
be
unpractical
now
that
we
come
to
facts
it
is
too
sudden
surely
who
knows
but
margaret
dear
i
go
for
her
other
letters
said
margaret
no
i
wo
i
finish
my
breakfast
in
fact
i
have
them
we
met
the
wilcoxes
on
an
awful
expedition
that
we
made
from
heidelberg
to
speyer
helen
and
i
had
got
it
into
our
heads
that
there
was
a
grand
old
cathedral
at
speyer
the
archbishop
of
speyer
was
one
of
the
seven
electors
you
know
maintz
and
koln
those
three
sees
once
commanded
the
rhine
valley
and
got
it
the
name
of
priest
street
i
still
feel
quite
uneasy
about
this
business
margaret
the
train
crossed
by
a
bridge
of
boats
and
at
first
sight
it
looked
quite
fine
but
oh
in
five
minutes
we
had
seen
the
whole
thing
the
cathedral
had
been
ruined
absolutely
ruined
by
restoration
not
an
inch
left
of
the
original
structure
we
wasted
a
whole
day
and
came
across
the
wilcoxes
as
we
were
eating
our
sandwiches
in
the
public
gardens
they
too
poor
things
had
been
taken
in
they
were
actually
stopping
at
speyer
and
they
rather
liked
helen
insisting
that
they
must
fly
with
us
to
heidelberg
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
did
come
on
next
day
we
all
took
some
drives
together
they
knew
us
well
enough
to
ask
helen
to
come
and
see
them
at
least
i
was
asked
too
but
illness
prevented
me
so
last
monday
she
went
alone
all
you
know
as
much
as
i
do
now
it
a
young
man
out
the
unknown
she
was
to
have
come
back
saturday
but
put
off
till
monday
perhaps
on
account
of
i
do
know
she
broke
off
and
listened
to
the
sounds
of
a
london
morning
their
house
was
in
wickham
place
and
fairly
quiet
for
a
lofty
promontory
of
buildings
separated
it
from
the
main
thoroughfare
one
had
the
sense
of
a
backwater
or
rather
of
an
estuary
whose
waters
flowed
in
from
the
invisible
sea
and
ebbed
into
a
profound
silence
while
the
waves
without
were
still
beating
though
the
promontory
consisted
of
flats
expensive
with
cavernous
entrance
halls
full
of
concierges
and
palms
it
fulfilled
its
purpose
and
gained
for
the
older
houses
opposite
a
certain
measure
of
peace
these
too
would
be
swept
away
in
time
and
another
promontory
would
rise
upon
their
site
as
humanity
piled
itself
higher
and
higher
on
the
precious
soil
of
london
munt
had
her
own
method
of
interpreting
her
nieces
she
decided
that
margaret
was
a
little
hysterical
and
was
trying
to
gain
time
by
a
torrent
of
talk
feeling
very
diplomatic
she
lamented
the
fate
of
speyer
and
declared
that
never
never
should
she
be
so
misguided
as
to
visit
it
and
added
of
her
own
accord
that
the
principles
of
restoration
were
ill
understood
in
germany
the
germans
she
said
are
too
thorough
and
this
is
all
very
well
sometimes
but
at
other
times
it
does
not
do
exactly
said
margaret
germans
are
too
thorough
and
her
eyes
began
to
shine
of
course
i
regard
you
schlegels
as
english
said
munt
hastily
english
to
the
backbone
margaret
leaned
forward
and
stroked
her
hand
and
that
reminds
me
helen
letter
oh
yes
aunt
juley
i
am
thinking
all
right
about
helen
letter
i
know
i
must
go
down
and
see
her
i
am
thinking
about
her
all
right
i
am
meaning
to
go
down
but
go
with
some
plan
said
munt
admitting
into
her
kindly
voice
a
note
of
exasperation
margaret
if
i
may
interfere
do
be
taken
by
surprise
what
do
you
think
of
the
wilcoxes
are
they
our
sort
are
they
likely
people
could
they
appreciate
helen
who
is
to
my
mind
a
very
special
sort
of
person
do
they
care
about
literature
and
art
that
is
most
important
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
literature
and
art
most
important
how
old
would
the
son
be
she
says
son
would
he
be
in
a
position
to
marry
is
he
likely
to
make
helen
happy
did
you
gather
i
gathered
nothing
they
began
to
talk
at
once
then
in
that
case
in
that
case
i
can
make
no
plans
do
you
see
on
the
contrary
i
hate
plans
i
hate
lines
of
action
helen
is
a
baby
then
in
that
case
my
dear
why
go
down
margaret
was
silent
if
her
aunt
could
not
see
why
she
must
go
down
she
was
not
going
to
tell
her
she
was
not
going
to
say
i
love
my
dear
sister
i
must
be
near
her
at
this
crisis
of
her
life
the
affections
are
more
reticent
than
the
passions
and
their
expression
more
subtle
if
she
herself
should
ever
fall
in
love
with
a
man
she
like
helen
would
proclaim
it
from
the
but
as
she
only
loved
a
sister
she
used
the
voiceless
language
of
sympathy
i
consider
you
odd
girls
continued
munt
and
very
wonderful
girls
and
in
many
ways
far
older
than
your
years
but
you
wo
be
offended
frankly
i
feel
you
are
not
up
to
this
business
it
requires
an
older
person
dear
i
have
nothing
to
call
me
back
to
swanage
she
spread
out
her
plump
arms
i
am
all
at
your
disposal
let
me
go
down
to
this
house
whose
name
i
forget
instead
of
you
aunt
juley
she
jumped
up
and
kissed
her
i
must
must
go
to
howards
end
myself
you
do
exactly
understand
though
i
can
never
thank
you
properly
for
offering
i
do
understand
retorted
munt
with
immense
confidence
i
go
down
in
no
spirit
of
interference
but
to
make
inquiries
inquiries
are
necessary
now
i
am
going
to
be
rude
you
would
say
the
wrong
thing
to
a
certainty
you
would
in
your
anxiety
for
helen
happiness
you
would
offend
the
whole
of
these
wilcoxes
by
asking
one
of
your
impetuous
questions
not
that
one
minds
offending
them
i
shall
ask
no
questions
i
have
it
in
helen
writing
that
she
and
a
man
are
in
love
there
is
no
question
to
ask
as
long
as
she
keeps
to
that
all
the
rest
is
worth
a
straw
a
long
engagement
if
you
like
but
inquiries
questions
plans
lines
of
action
no
aunt
juley
no
away
she
hurried
not
beautiful
not
supremely
brilliant
but
filled
with
something
that
took
the
place
of
both
qualities
something
best
described
as
a
profound
vivacity
a
continual
and
sincere
response
to
all
that
she
encountered
in
her
path
through
life
if
helen
had
written
the
same
to
me
about
a
or
a
penniless
clerk
dear
margaret
do
come
into
the
library
and
shut
the
door
your
good
maids
are
dusting
the
banisters
or
if
she
had
wanted
to
marry
the
man
who
calls
for
carter
paterson
i
should
have
said
the
same
then
with
one
of
those
turns
that
convinced
her
aunt
that
she
was
not
mad
really
and
convinced
observers
of
another
type
that
she
was
not
a
barren
theorist
she
added
though
in
the
case
of
carter
paterson
i
should
want
it
to
be
a
very
long
engagement
indeed
i
must
say
i
should
think
so
said
munt
and
indeed
i
can
scarcely
follow
you
now
just
imagine
if
you
said
anything
of
that
sort
to
the
wilcoxes
i
understand
it
but
most
good
people
would
think
you
mad
imagine
how
disconcerting
for
helen
what
is
wanted
is
a
person
who
will
go
slowly
slowly
in
this
business
and
see
how
things
are
and
where
they
are
likely
to
lead
to
margaret
was
down
on
this
but
you
implied
just
now
that
the
engagement
must
be
broken
off
i
think
probably
it
must
but
slowly
can
you
break
an
engagement
off
slowly
her
eyes
lit
up
what
an
engagement
made
of
do
you
suppose
i
think
it
made
of
some
hard
stuff
that
may
snap
but
break
it
is
different
to
the
other
ties
of
life
they
stretch
or
bend
they
admit
of
degree
they
different
exactly
so
but
wo
you
let
me
just
run
down
to
howards
house
and
save
you
all
the
discomfort
i
will
really
not
interfere
but
i
do
so
thoroughly
understand
the
kind
of
thing
you
schlegels
want
that
one
quiet
look
round
will
be
enough
for
me
margaret
again
thanked
her
again
kissed
her
and
then
ran
upstairs
to
see
her
brother
he
was
not
so
well
the
hay
fever
had
worried
him
a
good
deal
all
night
his
head
ached
his
eyes
were
wet
his
mucous
membrane
he
informed
her
was
in
a
most
unsatisfactory
condition
the
only
thing
that
made
life
worth
living
was
the
thought
of
walter
savage
landor
from
whose
imaginary
conversations
she
had
promised
to
read
at
frequent
intervals
during
the
day
it
was
rather
difficult
something
must
be
done
about
helen
she
must
be
assured
that
it
is
not
a
criminal
offence
to
love
at
first
sight
a
telegram
to
this
effect
would
be
cold
and
cryptic
a
personal
visit
seemed
each
moment
more
impossible
now
the
doctor
arrived
and
said
that
tibby
was
quite
bad
might
it
really
be
best
to
accept
aunt
juley
kind
offer
and
to
send
her
down
to
howards
end
with
a
note
certainly
margaret
was
impulsive
she
did
swing
rapidly
from
one
decision
to
another
running
downstairs
into
the
library
she
cried
yes
i
have
changed
my
mind
i
do
wish
that
you
would
go
there
was
a
train
from
king
cross
at
eleven
at
ten
tibby
with
rare
fell
asleep
and
margaret
was
able
to
drive
her
aunt
to
the
station
you
will
remember
aunt
juley
not
to
be
drawn
into
discussing
the
engagement
give
my
letter
to
helen
and
say
whatever
you
feel
yourself
but
do
keep
clear
of
the
relatives
we
have
scarcely
got
their
names
straight
yet
and
besides
that
sort
of
thing
is
so
uncivilized
and
wrong
so
uncivilized
queried
munt
fearing
that
she
was
losing
the
point
of
some
brilliant
remark
oh
i
used
an
affected
word
i
only
meant
would
you
please
only
talk
the
thing
over
with
helen
only
with
helen
because
but
it
was
no
moment
to
expound
the
personal
nature
of
love
even
margaret
shrank
from
it
and
contented
herself
with
stroking
her
good
aunt
hand
and
with
meditating
half
sensibly
and
half
poetically
on
the
journey
that
was
about
to
begin
from
king
cross
like
many
others
who
have
lived
long
in
a
great
capital
she
had
strong
feelings
about
the
various
railway
termini
they
are
our
gates
to
the
glorious
and
the
unknown
through
them
we
pass
out
into
adventure
and
sunshine
to
them
alas
we
return
in
paddington
all
cornwall
is
latent
and
the
remoter
west
down
the
inclines
of
liverpool
street
lie
fenlands
and
the
illimitable
broads
scotland
is
through
the
pylons
of
euston
wessex
behind
the
poised
chaos
of
waterloo
italians
realize
this
as
is
natural
those
of
them
who
are
so
unfortunate
as
to
serve
as
waiters
in
berlin
call
the
anhalt
bahnhof
the
stazione
because
by
it
they
must
return
to
their
homes
and
he
is
a
chilly
londoner
who
does
not
endow
his
stations
with
some
personality
and
extend
to
them
however
shyly
the
emotions
of
fear
and
love
to
margaret
i
hope
that
it
will
not
set
the
reader
against
her
the
station
of
king
cross
had
always
suggested
infinity
its
very
situation
withdrawn
a
little
behind
the
facile
splendours
of
pancras
implied
a
comment
on
the
materialism
of
life
those
two
great
arches
colourless
indifferent
shouldering
between
them
an
unlovely
clock
were
fit
portals
for
some
eternal
adventure
whose
issue
might
be
prosperous
but
would
certainly
not
be
expressed
in
the
ordinary
language
of
prosperity
if
you
think
this
ridiculous
remember
that
it
is
not
margaret
who
is
telling
you
about
it
and
let
me
hasten
to
add
that
they
were
in
plenty
of
time
for
the
train
that
munt
though
she
took
a
ticket
was
put
by
the
guard
into
a
first
only
two
seconds
on
the
train
one
smoking
and
the
other
babies
one
can
not
be
expected
to
travel
with
babies
and
that
margaret
on
her
return
to
wickham
place
was
confronted
with
the
following
telegram
all
over
wish
i
had
never
written
tell
no
one
helen
but
aunt
juley
was
gone
gone
irrevocably
and
no
power
on
earth
could
stop
her
chapter
most
complacently
did
munt
rehearse
her
mission
her
nieces
were
independent
young
women
and
it
was
not
often
that
she
was
able
to
help
them
emily
daughters
had
never
been
quite
like
other
girls
they
had
been
left
motherless
when
tibby
was
born
when
helen
was
five
and
margaret
herself
but
thirteen
it
was
before
the
passing
of
the
deceased
wife
sister
bill
so
munt
could
without
impropriety
offer
to
go
and
keep
house
at
wickham
place
but
her
who
was
peculiar
and
a
german
had
referred
the
question
to
margaret
who
with
the
crudity
of
youth
had
answered
no
they
could
manage
much
better
alone
five
years
later
schlegel
had
died
too
and
munt
had
repeated
her
offer
margaret
crude
no
longer
had
been
grateful
and
extremely
nice
but
the
substance
of
her
answer
had
been
the
same
i
must
not
interfere
a
third
time
thought
munt
however
of
course
she
did
she
learnt
to
her
horror
that
margaret
now
of
age
was
taking
her
money
out
of
the
old
safe
investments
and
putting
it
into
foreign
things
which
always
smash
silence
would
have
been
criminal
her
own
fortune
was
invested
in
home
rails
and
most
ardently
did
she
beg
her
niece
to
imitate
her
then
we
should
be
together
dear
margaret
out
of
politeness
invested
a
few
hundreds
in
the
nottingham
and
derby
railway
and
though
the
foreign
things
did
admirably
and
the
nottingham
and
derby
declined
with
the
steady
dignity
of
which
only
home
rails
are
capable
munt
never
ceased
to
rejoice
and
to
say
i
did
manage
that
at
all
events
when
the
smash
comes
poor
margaret
will
have
a
to
fall
back
upon
this
year
helen
came
of
age
and
exactly
the
same
thing
happened
in
helen
case
she
also
would
shift
her
money
out
of
consols
but
she
too
almost
without
being
pressed
consecrated
a
fraction
of
it
to
the
nottingham
and
derby
railway
so
far
so
good
but
in
social
matters
their
aunt
had
accomplished
nothing
sooner
or
later
the
girls
would
enter
on
the
process
known
as
throwing
themselves
away
and
if
they
had
delayed
hitherto
it
was
only
that
they
might
throw
themselves
more
vehemently
in
the
future
they
saw
too
many
people
at
wickham
place
unshaven
musicians
an
actress
even
german
cousins
one
knows
what
foreigners
are
acquaintances
picked
up
at
continental
hotels
one
knows
what
they
are
too
it
was
interesting
and
down
at
swanage
no
one
appreciated
culture
more
than
munt
but
it
was
dangerous
and
disaster
was
bound
to
come
how
right
she
was
and
how
lucky
to
be
on
the
spot
when
the
disaster
came
the
train
sped
northward
under
innumerable
tunnels
it
was
only
an
hour
journey
but
munt
had
to
raise
and
lower
the
window
again
and
again
she
passed
through
the
south
welwyn
tunnel
saw
light
for
a
moment
and
entered
the
north
welwyn
tunnel
of
tragic
fame
she
traversed
the
immense
viaduct
whose
arches
span
untroubled
meadows
and
the
dreamy
flow
of
tewin
water
she
skirted
the
parks
of
politicians
at
times
the
great
north
road
accompanied
her
more
suggestive
of
infinity
than
any
railway
awakening
after
a
nap
of
a
hundred
years
to
such
life
as
is
conferred
by
the
stench
of
and
to
such
culture
as
is
implied
by
the
advertisements
of
antibilious
pills
to
history
to
tragedy
to
the
past
to
the
future
munt
remained
equally
indifferent
hers
but
to
concentrate
on
the
end
of
her
journey
and
to
rescue
poor
helen
from
this
dreadful
mess
the
station
for
howards
end
was
at
hilton
one
of
the
large
villages
that
are
strung
so
frequently
along
the
north
road
and
that
owe
their
size
to
the
traffic
of
coaching
and
days
being
near
london
it
had
not
shared
in
the
rural
decay
and
its
long
high
street
had
budded
out
right
and
left
into
residential
estates
for
about
a
mile
a
series
of
tiled
and
slated
houses
passed
before
inattentive
eyes
a
series
broken
at
one
point
by
six
danish
tumuli
that
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
along
the
highroad
tombs
of
soldiers
beyond
these
tumuli
habitations
thickened
and
the
train
came
to
a
standstill
in
a
tangle
that
was
almost
a
town
the
station
like
the
scenery
like
helen
letters
struck
an
indeterminate
note
into
which
country
will
it
lead
england
or
suburbia
it
was
new
it
had
island
platforms
and
a
subway
and
the
superficial
comfort
exacted
by
business
men
but
it
held
hints
of
local
life
personal
intercourse
as
even
munt
was
to
discover
i
want
a
house
she
confided
to
the
ticket
boy
its
name
is
howards
lodge
do
you
know
where
it
is
mr
wilcox
the
boy
called
a
young
man
in
front
of
them
turned
round
she
wanting
howards
end
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
forward
though
munt
was
too
much
agitated
even
to
stare
at
the
stranger
but
remembering
that
there
were
two
brothers
she
had
the
sense
to
say
to
him
excuse
me
asking
but
are
you
the
younger
wilcox
or
the
elder
the
younger
can
i
do
anything
for
you
oh
well
she
controlled
herself
with
difficulty
really
are
you
i
she
moved
away
from
the
ticket
boy
and
lowered
her
voice
i
am
miss
schlegels
aunt
i
ought
to
introduce
myself
ought
i
my
name
is
mrs
munt
she
was
conscious
that
he
raised
his
cap
and
said
quite
coolly
oh
rather
miss
schlegel
is
stopping
with
us
did
you
want
to
see
her
possibly
i
call
you
a
cab
no
wait
a
mo
he
thought
our
motor
here
i
run
you
up
in
it
that
is
very
kind
not
at
all
if
you
just
wait
till
they
bring
out
a
parcel
from
the
office
this
way
my
niece
is
not
with
you
by
any
chance
no
i
came
over
with
my
father
he
has
gone
on
north
in
your
train
you
see
miss
schlegel
at
lunch
coming
up
to
lunch
i
hope
i
should
like
to
come
up
said
munt
not
committing
herself
to
nourishment
until
she
had
studied
helen
lover
a
little
more
he
seemed
a
gentleman
but
had
so
rattled
her
round
that
her
powers
of
observation
were
numbed
she
glanced
at
him
stealthily
to
a
feminine
eye
there
was
nothing
amiss
in
the
sharp
depressions
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
nor
in
the
rather
construction
of
his
forehead
he
was
dark
and
seemed
accustomed
to
command
in
front
or
behind
which
do
you
prefer
it
may
be
windy
in
front
in
front
if
i
may
then
we
can
talk
but
excuse
me
one
moment
i
ca
think
what
doing
with
that
parcel
he
strode
into
the
and
called
with
a
new
voice
hi
hi
you
there
are
you
going
to
keep
me
waiting
all
day
parcel
for
wilcox
howards
end
just
look
sharp
emerging
he
said
in
quieter
tones
this
station
abominably
organized
if
i
had
my
way
the
whole
lot
of
should
get
the
sack
may
i
help
you
in
this
is
very
good
of
you
said
munt
as
she
settled
herself
into
a
luxurious
cavern
of
red
leather
and
suffered
her
person
to
be
padded
with
rugs
and
shawls
she
was
more
civil
than
she
had
intended
but
really
this
young
man
was
very
kind
moreover
she
was
a
little
afraid
of
him
his
was
extraordinary
very
good
indeed
she
repeated
adding
it
is
just
what
i
should
have
wished
very
good
of
you
to
say
so
he
replied
with
a
slight
look
of
surprise
which
like
most
slight
looks
escaped
munt
attention
i
was
just
tooling
my
father
over
to
catch
the
down
train
you
see
we
heard
from
helen
this
morning
young
wilcox
was
pouring
in
petrol
starting
his
engine
and
performing
other
actions
with
which
this
story
has
no
concern
the
great
car
began
to
rock
and
the
form
of
munt
trying
to
explain
things
sprang
agreeably
up
and
down
among
the
red
cushions
the
mater
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
he
mumbled
hi
i
say
parcel
for
howards
end
bring
it
out
hi
a
bearded
porter
emerged
with
the
parcel
in
one
hand
and
an
entry
book
in
the
other
with
the
gathering
whir
of
the
motor
these
ejaculations
mingled
sign
must
i
why
the
should
i
sign
after
all
this
bother
not
even
got
a
pencil
on
you
remember
next
time
i
report
you
to
the
my
time
of
value
though
yours
be
here
here
being
a
tip
extremely
sorry
mrs
munt
not
at
all
mr
wilcox
and
do
you
object
to
going
through
the
village
it
is
rather
a
longer
spin
but
i
have
one
or
two
commissions
i
should
love
going
through
the
village
naturally
i
am
very
anxious
to
talk
things
over
with
you
as
she
said
this
she
felt
ashamed
for
she
was
disobeying
margaret
instructions
only
disobeying
them
in
the
letter
surely
margaret
had
only
warned
her
against
discussing
the
incident
with
outsiders
surely
it
was
not
uncivilized
or
wrong
to
discuss
it
with
the
young
man
himself
since
chance
had
thrown
them
together
a
reticent
fellow
he
made
no
reply
mounting
by
her
side
he
put
on
gloves
and
spectacles
and
off
they
drove
the
bearded
porter
life
is
a
mysterious
business
looking
after
them
with
admiration
the
wind
was
in
their
faces
down
the
station
road
blowing
the
dust
into
munt
eyes
but
as
soon
as
they
turned
into
the
great
north
road
she
opened
fire
you
can
well
imagine
she
said
that
the
news
was
a
great
shock
to
us
what
news
wilcox
she
said
frankly
margaret
has
told
me
everything
everything
i
have
seen
helen
letter
he
could
not
look
her
in
the
face
as
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
work
he
was
travelling
as
quickly
as
he
dared
down
the
high
street
but
he
inclined
his
head
in
her
direction
and
said
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
catch
about
helen
helen
of
course
helen
is
a
very
exceptional
person
i
am
sure
you
will
let
me
say
this
feeling
towards
her
as
you
do
indeed
all
the
schlegels
are
exceptional
i
come
in
no
spirit
of
interference
but
it
was
a
great
shock
they
drew
up
opposite
a
draper
without
replying
he
turned
round
in
his
seat
and
contemplated
the
cloud
of
dust
that
they
had
raised
in
their
passage
through
the
village
it
was
settling
again
but
not
all
into
the
road
from
which
he
had
taken
it
some
of
it
had
percolated
through
the
open
windows
some
had
whitened
the
roses
and
gooseberries
of
the
wayside
gardens
while
a
certain
proportion
had
entered
the
lungs
of
the
villagers
i
wonder
when
they
learn
wisdom
and
tar
the
roads
was
his
comment
then
a
man
ran
out
of
the
draper
with
a
roll
of
oilcloth
and
off
they
went
again
margaret
could
not
come
herself
on
account
of
poor
tibby
so
i
am
here
to
represent
her
and
to
have
a
good
talk
i
sorry
to
be
so
dense
said
the
young
man
again
drawing
up
outside
a
shop
but
i
still
have
quite
understood
helen
wilcox
my
niece
and
you
he
pushed
up
his
goggles
and
gazed
at
her
absolutely
bewildered
horror
smote
her
to
the
heart
for
even
she
began
to
suspect
that
they
were
at
and
that
she
had
commenced
her
mission
by
some
hideous
blunder
miss
schlegel
and
myself
he
asked
compressing
his
lips
i
trust
there
has
been
no
misunderstanding
quavered
munt
her
letter
certainly
read
that
way
what
way
that
you
and
she
she
paused
then
drooped
her
eyelids
i
think
i
catch
your
meaning
he
said
stickily
what
an
extraordinary
mistake
then
you
did
the
least
she
stammered
getting
in
the
face
and
wishing
she
had
never
been
born
scarcely
as
i
am
already
engaged
to
another
lady
there
was
a
moment
silence
and
then
he
caught
his
breath
and
exploded
with
oh
good
god
do
tell
me
it
some
silliness
of
paul
but
you
are
paul
i
not
then
why
did
you
say
so
at
the
station
i
said
nothing
of
the
sort
i
beg
your
pardon
you
did
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
not
my
name
is
charles
younger
may
mean
son
as
opposed
to
father
or
second
brother
as
opposed
to
first
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
either
view
and
later
on
they
said
it
but
they
had
other
questions
before
them
now
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
paul
but
she
did
not
like
his
voice
he
sounded
as
if
he
was
talking
to
a
porter
and
certain
that
he
had
deceived
her
at
the
station
she
too
grew
angry
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
paul
and
your
niece
munt
such
is
human
nature
determined
that
she
would
champion
the
lovers
she
was
not
going
to
be
bullied
by
a
severe
young
man
yes
they
care
for
one
another
very
much
indeed
she
said
i
dare
say
they
will
tell
you
about
it
we
heard
this
morning
and
charles
clenched
his
fist
and
cried
the
idiot
the
idiot
the
little
fool
munt
tried
to
divest
herself
of
her
rugs
if
that
is
your
attitude
wilcox
i
prefer
to
walk
i
beg
you
will
do
no
such
thing
i
take
you
up
this
moment
to
the
house
let
me
tell
you
the
impossible
and
must
be
stopped
munt
did
not
often
lose
her
temper
and
when
she
did
it
was
only
to
protect
those
whom
she
loved
on
this
occasion
she
blazed
out
i
quite
agree
sir
the
thing
is
impossible
and
i
will
come
up
and
stop
it
my
niece
is
a
very
exceptional
person
and
i
am
not
inclined
to
sit
still
while
she
throws
herself
away
on
those
who
will
not
appreciate
her
charles
worked
his
jaws
considering
she
has
only
known
your
brother
since
wednesday
and
only
met
your
father
and
mother
at
a
stray
hotel
could
you
possibly
lower
your
voice
the
shopman
will
overhear
esprit
de
classe
if
one
may
coin
the
phrase
was
strong
in
munt
she
sat
quivering
while
a
member
of
the
lower
orders
deposited
a
metal
funnel
a
saucepan
and
a
garden
squirt
beside
the
roll
of
oilcloth
right
behind
yes
sir
and
the
lower
orders
vanished
in
a
cloud
of
dust
i
warn
you
paul
has
a
penny
it
useless
no
need
to
warn
us
wilcox
i
assure
you
the
warning
is
all
the
other
way
my
niece
has
been
very
foolish
and
i
shall
give
her
a
good
scolding
and
take
her
back
to
london
with
me
he
has
to
make
his
way
out
in
nigeria
he
think
of
marrying
for
years
and
when
he
does
it
must
be
a
woman
who
can
stand
the
climate
and
is
in
other
ways
why
has
he
told
us
of
course
he
ashamed
he
knows
been
a
fool
and
so
he
has
a
damned
fool
she
grew
furious
whereas
miss
schlegel
has
lost
no
time
in
publishing
the
news
if
i
were
a
man
wilcox
for
that
last
remark
box
your
ears
you
not
fit
to
clean
my
niece
boots
to
sit
in
the
same
room
with
her
and
you
dare
you
actually
dare
i
decline
to
argue
with
such
a
person
all
i
know
is
she
spread
the
thing
and
he
has
and
my
father
away
and
i
and
all
that
i
know
is
might
i
finish
my
sentence
please
no
charles
clenched
his
teeth
and
sent
the
motor
swerving
all
over
the
lane
she
screamed
so
they
played
the
game
of
capping
families
a
round
of
which
is
always
played
when
love
would
unite
two
members
of
our
race
but
they
played
it
with
unusual
vigour
stating
in
so
many
words
that
schlegels
were
better
than
wilcoxes
wilcoxes
better
than
schlegels
they
flung
decency
aside
the
man
was
young
the
woman
deeply
stirred
in
both
a
vein
of
coarseness
was
latent
their
quarrel
was
no
more
surprising
than
are
most
quarrels
inevitable
at
the
time
incredible
afterwards
but
it
was
more
than
usually
futile
a
few
minutes
and
they
were
enlightened
the
motor
drew
up
at
howards
end
and
helen
looking
very
pale
ran
out
to
meet
her
aunt
aunt
juley
i
have
just
had
a
telegram
from
margaret
i
i
meant
to
stop
your
coming
it
is
it
over
the
climax
was
too
much
for
munt
she
burst
into
tears
aunt
juley
dear
do
do
let
them
know
i
been
so
silly
it
was
anything
do
bear
up
for
my
sake
paul
cried
charles
wilcox
pulling
his
gloves
off
do
let
them
know
they
are
never
to
know
oh
my
darling
helen
paul
paul
a
very
young
man
came
out
of
the
house
paul
is
there
any
truth
in
this
i
did
i
do
yes
or
no
man
plain
question
plain
answer
did
or
did
miss
schlegel
charles
dear
said
a
voice
from
the
garden
charles
dear
charles
one
does
ask
plain
questions
there
such
things
they
were
all
silent
it
was
wilcox
she
approached
just
as
helen
letter
had
described
her
trailing
noiselessly
over
the
lawn
and
there
was
actually
a
wisp
of
hay
in
her
hands
she
seemed
to
belong
not
to
the
young
people
and
their
motor
but
to
the
house
and
to
the
tree
that
overshadowed
it
one
knew
that
she
worshipped
the
past
and
that
the
instinctive
wisdom
the
past
can
alone
bestow
had
descended
upon
her
that
wisdom
to
which
we
give
the
clumsy
name
of
aristocracy
high
born
she
might
not
be
but
assuredly
she
cared
about
her
ancestors
and
let
them
help
her
when
she
saw
charles
angry
paul
frightened
and
munt
in
tears
she
heard
her
ancestors
say
separate
those
human
beings
who
will
hurt
each
other
most
the
rest
can
wait
so
she
did
not
ask
questions
still
less
did
she
pretend
that
nothing
had
happened
as
a
competent
society
hostess
would
have
done
she
said
miss
schlegel
would
you
take
your
aunt
up
to
your
room
or
to
my
room
whichever
you
think
best
paul
do
find
evie
and
tell
her
lunch
for
six
but
i
not
sure
whether
we
shall
all
be
downstairs
for
it
and
when
they
had
obeyed
her
she
turned
to
her
elder
son
who
still
stood
in
the
throbbing
stinking
car
and
smiled
at
him
with
tenderness
and
without
a
word
turned
away
from
him
towards
her
flowers
mother
he
called
are
you
aware
that
paul
has
been
playing
the
fool
again
it
all
right
dear
they
have
broken
off
the
engagement
engagement
they
do
not
love
any
longer
if
you
prefer
it
put
that
way
said
wilcox
stooping
down
to
smell
a
rose
chapter
helen
and
her
aunt
returned
to
wickham
place
in
a
state
of
collapse
and
for
a
little
time
margaret
had
three
invalids
on
her
hands
munt
soon
recovered
she
possessed
to
a
remarkable
degree
the
power
of
distorting
the
past
and
before
many
days
were
over
she
had
forgotten
the
part
played
by
her
own
imprudence
in
the
catastrophe
even
at
the
crisis
she
had
cried
thank
goodness
poor
margaret
is
saved
this
which
during
the
journey
to
london
evolved
into
it
had
to
be
gone
through
by
someone
which
in
its
turn
ripened
into
the
permanent
form
of
the
one
time
i
really
did
help
emily
girls
was
over
the
wilcox
business
but
helen
was
a
more
serious
patient
new
ideas
had
burst
upon
her
like
a
thunder
clap
and
by
them
and
by
her
reverberations
she
had
been
stunned
the
truth
was
that
she
had
fallen
in
love
not
with
an
individual
but
with
a
family
before
paul
arrived
she
had
as
it
were
been
tuned
up
into
his
key
the
energy
of
the
wilcoxes
had
fascinated
her
had
created
new
images
of
beauty
in
her
responsive
mind
to
be
all
day
with
them
in
the
open
air
to
sleep
at
night
under
their
roof
had
seemed
the
supreme
joy
of
life
and
had
led
to
that
abandonment
of
personality
that
is
a
possible
prelude
to
love
she
had
liked
giving
in
to
wilcox
or
evie
or
charles
she
had
liked
being
told
that
her
notions
of
life
were
sheltered
or
academic
that
equality
was
nonsense
votes
for
women
nonsense
socialism
nonsense
art
and
literature
except
when
conducive
to
strengthening
the
character
nonsense
one
by
one
the
schlegel
fetiches
had
been
overthrown
and
though
professing
to
defend
them
she
had
rejoiced
when
wilcox
said
that
one
sound
man
of
business
did
more
good
to
the
world
than
a
dozen
of
your
social
reformers
she
had
swallowed
the
curious
assertion
without
a
gasp
and
had
leant
back
luxuriously
among
the
cushions
of
his
when
charles
said
why
be
so
polite
to
servants
they
do
understand
it
she
had
not
given
the
schlegel
retort
of
if
they
do
understand
it
i
do
no
she
had
vowed
to
be
less
polite
to
servants
in
the
future
i
am
swathed
in
cant
she
thought
and
it
is
good
for
me
to
be
stripped
of
it
and
all
that
she
thought
or
did
or
breathed
was
a
quiet
preparation
for
paul
paul
was
inevitable
charles
was
taken
up
with
another
girl
wilcox
was
so
old
evie
so
young
wilcox
so
different
round
the
absent
brother
she
began
to
throw
the
halo
of
romance
to
irradiate
him
with
all
the
splendour
of
those
happy
days
to
feel
that
in
him
she
should
draw
nearest
to
the
robust
ideal
he
and
she
were
about
the
same
age
evie
said
most
people
thought
paul
handsomer
than
his
brother
he
was
certainly
a
better
shot
though
not
so
good
at
golf
and
when
paul
appeared
flushed
with
the
triumph
of
getting
through
an
examination
and
ready
to
flirt
with
any
pretty
girl
helen
met
him
halfway
or
more
than
halfway
and
turned
towards
him
on
the
sunday
evening
he
had
been
talking
of
his
approaching
exile
in
nigeria
and
he
should
have
continued
to
talk
of
it
and
allowed
their
guest
to
recover
but
the
heave
of
her
bosom
flattered
him
passion
was
possible
and
he
became
passionate
deep
down
in
him
something
whispered
this
girl
would
let
you
kiss
her
you
might
not
have
such
a
chance
again
that
was
how
it
happened
or
rather
how
helen
described
it
to
her
sister
using
words
even
more
unsympathetic
than
my
own
but
the
poetry
of
that
kiss
the
wonder
of
it
the
magic
that
there
was
in
life
for
hours
after
it
who
can
describe
that
it
is
so
easy
for
an
englishman
to
sneer
at
these
chance
collisions
of
human
beings
to
the
insular
cynic
and
the
insular
moralist
they
offer
an
equal
opportunity
it
is
so
easy
to
talk
of
passing
emotion
and
how
to
forget
how
vivid
the
emotion
was
ere
it
passed
our
impulse
to
sneer
to
forget
is
at
root
a
good
one
we
recognize
that
emotion
is
not
enough
and
that
men
and
women
are
personalities
capable
of
sustained
relations
not
mere
opportunities
for
an
electrical
discharge
yet
we
rate
the
impulse
too
highly
we
do
not
admit
that
by
collisions
of
this
trivial
sort
the
doors
of
heaven
may
be
shaken
open
to
helen
at
all
events
her
life
was
to
bring
nothing
more
intense
than
the
embrace
of
this
boy
who
played
no
part
in
it
he
had
drawn
her
out
of
the
house
where
there
was
danger
of
surprise
and
light
he
had
led
her
by
a
path
he
knew
until
they
stood
under
the
column
of
the
vast
a
man
in
the
darkness
he
had
whispered
i
love
you
when
she
was
desiring
love
in
time
his
slender
personality
faded
the
scene
that
he
had
evoked
endured
in
all
the
variable
years
that
followed
she
never
saw
the
like
of
it
again
i
understand
said
margaret
at
least
i
understand
as
much
as
ever
is
understood
of
these
things
tell
me
now
what
happened
on
the
monday
morning
it
was
over
at
once
how
helen
i
was
still
happy
while
i
dressed
but
as
i
came
downstairs
i
got
nervous
and
when
i
went
into
the
i
knew
it
was
no
good
there
was
evie
i
explain
managing
the
and
wilcox
reading
the
times
was
paul
there
yes
and
charles
was
talking
to
him
about
stocks
and
shares
and
he
looked
frightened
by
slight
indications
the
sisters
could
convey
much
to
each
other
margaret
saw
horror
latent
in
the
scene
and
helen
next
remark
did
not
surprise
her
somehow
when
that
kind
of
man
looks
frightened
it
is
too
awful
it
is
all
right
for
us
to
be
frightened
or
for
men
of
another
sort
father
for
instance
but
for
men
like
that
when
i
saw
all
the
others
so
placid
and
paul
mad
with
terror
in
case
i
said
the
wrong
thing
i
felt
for
a
moment
that
the
whole
wilcox
family
was
a
fraud
just
a
wall
of
newspapers
and
and
and
that
if
it
fell
i
should
find
nothing
behind
it
but
panic
and
i
do
think
that
the
wilcoxes
struck
me
as
being
genuine
people
particularly
the
wife
no
i
do
really
think
that
but
paul
was
so
all
kinds
of
extraordinary
things
made
it
worse
and
i
knew
that
it
would
never
do
never
i
said
to
him
after
breakfast
when
the
others
were
practising
strokes
rather
lost
our
heads
and
he
looked
better
at
once
though
frightfully
ashamed
he
began
a
speech
about
having
no
money
to
marry
on
but
it
hurt
him
to
make
it
and
i
stopped
him
then
he
said
must
beg
your
pardon
over
this
miss
schlegel
i
ca
think
what
came
over
me
last
night
and
i
said
what
over
me
never
mind
and
then
we
parted
at
least
until
i
remembered
that
i
had
written
straight
off
to
tell
you
the
night
before
and
that
frightened
him
again
i
asked
him
to
send
a
telegram
for
me
for
he
knew
you
would
be
coming
or
something
and
he
tried
to
get
hold
of
the
motor
but
charles
and
wilcox
wanted
it
to
go
to
the
station
and
charles
offered
to
send
the
telegram
for
me
and
then
i
had
to
say
that
the
telegram
was
of
no
consequence
for
paul
said
charles
might
read
it
and
though
i
wrote
it
out
several
times
he
always
said
people
would
suspect
something
he
took
it
himself
at
last
pretending
that
he
must
walk
down
to
get
cartridges
and
what
with
one
thing
and
the
other
it
was
not
handed
in
at
the
post
office
until
too
late
it
was
the
most
terrible
morning
paul
disliked
me
more
and
more
and
evie
talked
cricket
averages
till
i
nearly
screamed
i
can
not
think
how
i
stood
her
all
the
other
days
at
last
charles
and
his
father
started
for
the
station
and
then
came
your
telegram
warning
me
that
aunt
juley
was
coming
by
that
train
and
paul
oh
rather
horrible
said
that
i
had
muddled
it
but
wilcox
knew
knew
what
everything
though
we
neither
of
us
told
her
a
word
and
had
known
all
along
i
think
oh
she
must
have
overheard
you
i
suppose
so
but
it
seemed
wonderful
when
charles
and
aunt
juley
drove
up
calling
each
other
names
wilcox
stepped
in
from
the
garden
and
made
everything
less
terrible
ugh
but
it
has
been
a
disgusting
business
to
think
that
she
sighed
to
think
that
because
you
and
a
young
man
meet
for
a
moment
there
must
be
all
these
telegrams
and
anger
supplied
margaret
helen
nodded
i
often
thought
about
it
helen
it
one
of
the
most
interesting
things
in
the
world
the
truth
is
that
there
is
a
great
outer
life
that
you
and
i
have
never
touched
a
life
in
which
telegrams
and
anger
count
personal
relations
that
we
think
supreme
are
not
supreme
there
there
love
means
marriage
settlements
death
death
duties
so
far
i
clear
but
here
my
difficulty
this
outer
life
though
obviously
horrid
often
seems
the
real
one
there
grit
in
it
it
does
breed
character
do
personal
relations
lead
to
sloppiness
in
the
end
oh
meg
that
what
i
felt
only
not
so
clearly
when
the
wilcoxes
were
so
competent
and
seemed
to
have
their
hands
on
all
the
do
you
feel
it
now
i
remember
paul
at
breakfast
said
helen
quietly
i
shall
never
forget
him
he
had
nothing
to
fall
back
upon
i
know
that
personal
relations
are
the
real
life
for
ever
and
ever
amen
so
the
wilcox
episode
fell
into
the
background
leaving
behind
it
memories
of
sweetness
and
horror
that
mingled
and
the
sisters
pursued
the
life
that
helen
had
commended
they
talked
to
each
other
and
to
other
people
they
filled
the
tall
thin
house
at
wickham
place
with
those
whom
they
liked
or
could
befriend
they
even
attended
public
meetings
in
their
own
fashion
they
cared
deeply
about
politics
though
not
as
politicians
would
have
us
care
they
desired
that
public
life
should
mirror
whatever
is
good
in
the
life
within
temperance
tolerance
and
sexual
equality
were
intelligible
cries
to
them
whereas
they
did
not
follow
our
forward
policy
in
thibet
with
the
keen
attention
that
it
merits
and
would
at
times
dismiss
the
whole
british
empire
with
a
puzzled
if
reverent
sigh
not
out
of
them
are
the
shows
of
history
erected
the
world
would
be
a
grey
bloodless
place
were
it
entirely
composed
of
miss
schlegels
but
the
world
being
what
it
is
perhaps
they
shine
out
in
it
like
stars
a
word
on
their
origin
they
were
not
english
to
the
backbone
as
their
aunt
had
piously
asserted
but
on
the
other
band
they
were
not
germans
of
the
dreadful
sort
their
father
had
belonged
to
a
type
that
was
more
prominent
in
germany
fifty
years
ago
than
now
he
was
not
the
aggressive
german
so
dear
to
the
english
journalist
nor
the
domestic
german
so
dear
to
the
english
wit
if
one
classed
him
at
all
it
would
be
as
the
countryman
of
hegel
and
kant
as
the
idealist
inclined
to
be
dreamy
whose
imperialism
was
the
imperialism
of
the
air
not
that
his
life
had
been
inactive
he
had
fought
like
blazes
against
denmark
austria
france
but
he
had
fought
without
visualizing
the
results
of
victory
a
hint
of
the
truth
broke
on
him
after
sedan
when
he
saw
the
dyed
moustaches
of
napoleon
going
grey
another
when
he
entered
paris
and
saw
the
smashed
windows
of
the
tuileries
peace
came
it
was
all
very
immense
one
had
turned
into
an
empire
but
he
knew
that
some
quality
had
vanished
for
which
not
all
could
compensate
him
germany
a
commercial
power
germany
a
naval
power
germany
with
colonies
here
and
a
forward
policy
there
and
legitimate
aspirations
in
the
other
place
might
appeal
to
others
and
be
fitly
served
by
them
for
his
own
part
he
abstained
from
the
fruits
of
victory
and
naturalized
himself
in
england
the
more
earnest
members
of
his
family
never
forgave
him
and
knew
that
his
children
though
scarcely
english
of
the
dreadful
sort
would
never
be
german
to
the
backbone
he
had
obtained
work
in
one
of
our
provincial
universities
and
there
married
poor
emily
or
die
englanderin
as
the
case
may
be
and
as
she
had
money
they
proceeded
to
london
and
came
to
know
a
good
many
people
but
his
gaze
was
always
fixed
beyond
the
sea
it
was
his
hope
that
the
clouds
of
materialism
obscuring
the
fatherland
would
part
in
time
and
the
mild
intellectual
light
do
you
imply
that
we
germans
are
stupid
uncle
ernst
exclaimed
a
haughty
and
magnificent
nephew
uncle
ernst
replied
to
my
mind
you
use
the
intellect
but
you
no
longer
care
about
it
that
i
call
stupidity
as
the
haughty
nephew
did
not
follow
he
continued
you
only
care
about
the
things
that
you
can
use
and
therefore
arrange
them
in
the
following
order
money
supremely
useful
intellect
rather
useful
imagination
of
no
use
at
all
no
for
the
other
had
protested
your
is
no
more
imaginative
than
is
our
imperialism
over
here
it
is
the
vice
of
a
vulgar
mind
to
be
thrilled
by
bigness
to
think
that
a
thousand
square
miles
are
a
thousand
times
more
wonderful
than
one
square
mile
and
that
a
million
square
miles
are
almost
the
same
as
heaven
that
is
not
imagination
no
it
kills
it
when
their
poets
over
here
try
to
celebrate
bigness
they
are
dead
at
once
and
naturally
your
poets
too
are
dying
your
philosophers
your
musicians
to
whom
europe
has
listened
for
two
hundred
years
gone
gone
with
the
little
courts
that
nurtured
them
gone
with
esterhaz
and
weimar
what
what
that
your
universities
oh
yes
you
have
learned
men
who
collect
more
facts
than
do
the
learned
men
of
england
they
collect
facts
and
facts
and
empires
of
facts
but
which
of
them
will
rekindle
the
light
within
to
all
this
margaret
listened
sitting
on
the
haughty
nephew
knee
it
was
a
unique
education
for
the
little
girls
the
haughty
nephew
would
be
at
wickham
place
one
day
bringing
with
him
an
even
haughtier
wife
both
convinced
that
germany
was
appointed
by
god
to
govern
the
world
aunt
juley
would
come
the
next
day
convinced
that
great
britain
had
been
appointed
to
the
same
post
by
the
same
authority
were
both
these
parties
right
on
one
occasion
they
had
met
and
margaret
with
clasped
hands
had
implored
them
to
argue
the
subject
out
in
her
presence
whereat
they
blushed
and
began
to
talk
about
the
weather
papa
she
cried
she
was
a
most
offensive
child
why
will
they
not
discuss
this
most
clear
question
her
father
surveying
the
parties
grimly
replied
that
he
did
not
know
putting
her
head
on
one
side
margaret
then
remarked
to
me
one
of
two
things
is
very
clear
either
god
does
not
know
his
own
mind
about
england
and
germany
or
else
these
do
not
know
the
mind
of
god
a
hateful
little
girl
but
at
thirteen
she
had
grasped
a
dilemma
that
most
people
travel
through
life
without
perceiving
her
brain
darted
up
and
down
it
grew
pliant
and
strong
her
conclusion
was
that
any
human
being
lies
nearer
to
the
unseen
than
any
organization
and
from
this
she
never
varied
helen
advanced
along
the
same
lines
though
with
a
more
irresponsible
tread
in
character
she
resembled
her
sister
but
she
was
pretty
and
so
apt
to
have
a
more
amusing
time
people
gathered
round
her
more
readily
especially
when
they
were
new
acquaintances
and
she
did
enjoy
a
little
homage
very
much
when
their
father
died
and
they
ruled
alone
at
wickham
place
she
often
absorbed
the
whole
of
the
company
while
margaret
both
were
tremendous
talkers
fell
flat
neither
sister
bothered
about
this
helen
never
apologized
afterwards
margaret
did
not
feel
the
slightest
rancour
but
looks
have
their
influence
upon
character
the
sisters
were
alike
as
little
girls
but
at
the
time
of
the
wilcox
episode
their
methods
were
beginning
to
diverge
the
younger
was
rather
apt
to
entice
people
and
in
enticing
them
to
be
herself
enticed
the
elder
went
straight
ahead
and
accepted
an
occasional
failure
as
part
of
the
game
little
need
be
premised
about
tibby
he
was
now
an
intelligent
man
of
sixteen
but
dyspeptic
and
difficile
chapter
it
will
be
generally
admitted
that
beethoven
fifth
symphony
is
the
most
sublime
noise
that
has
ever
penetrated
into
the
ear
of
man
all
sorts
and
conditions
are
satisfied
by
it
whether
you
are
like
munt
and
tap
surreptitiously
when
the
tunes
come
of
course
not
so
as
to
disturb
the
others
or
like
helen
who
can
see
heroes
and
shipwrecks
in
the
music
flood
or
like
margaret
who
can
only
see
the
music
or
like
tibby
who
is
profoundly
versed
in
counterpoint
and
holds
the
full
score
open
on
his
knee
or
like
their
cousin
fraulein
mosebach
who
remembers
all
the
time
that
beethoven
is
echt
deutsch
or
like
fraulein
mosebach
young
man
who
can
remember
nothing
but
fraulein
mosebach
in
any
case
the
passion
of
your
life
becomes
more
vivid
and
you
are
bound
to
admit
that
such
a
noise
is
cheap
at
two
shillings
it
is
cheap
even
if
you
hear
it
in
the
queen
hall
dreariest
in
london
though
not
as
dreary
as
the
free
trade
hall
manchester
and
even
if
you
sit
on
the
extreme
left
of
that
hall
so
that
the
brass
bumps
at
you
before
the
rest
of
the
orchestra
arrives
it
is
still
cheap
who
is
margaret
talking
to
said
munt
at
the
conclusion
of
the
first
movement
she
was
again
in
london
on
a
visit
to
wickham
place
helen
looked
down
the
long
line
of
their
party
and
said
that
she
did
not
know
would
it
be
some
young
man
or
other
whom
she
takes
an
interest
in
i
expect
so
helen
replied
music
enwrapped
her
and
she
could
not
enter
into
the
distinction
that
divides
young
men
whom
one
takes
an
interest
in
from
young
men
whom
one
knows
you
girls
are
so
wonderful
in
always
having
oh
dear
one
must
talk
for
the
andante
had
begun
very
beautiful
but
bearing
a
family
likeness
to
all
the
other
beautiful
andantes
that
beethoven
had
written
and
to
helen
mind
rather
disconnecting
the
heroes
and
shipwrecks
of
the
first
movement
from
the
heroes
and
goblins
of
the
third
she
heard
the
tune
through
once
and
then
her
attention
wandered
and
she
gazed
at
the
audience
or
the
organ
or
the
architecture
much
did
she
censure
the
attenuated
cupids
who
encircle
the
ceiling
of
the
queen
hall
inclining
each
to
each
with
vapid
gesture
and
clad
in
sallow
pantaloons
on
which
the
october
sunlight
struck
how
awful
to
marry
a
man
like
those
cupids
thought
helen
here
beethoven
started
decorating
his
tune
so
she
heard
him
through
once
more
and
then
she
smiled
at
her
cousin
frieda
but
frieda
listening
to
classical
music
could
not
respond
herr
liesecke
too
looked
as
if
wild
horses
could
not
make
him
inattentive
there
were
lines
across
his
forehead
his
lips
were
parted
his
at
right
angles
to
his
nose
and
he
had
laid
a
thick
white
hand
on
either
knee
and
next
to
her
was
aunt
juley
so
british
and
wanting
to
tap
how
interesting
that
row
of
people
was
what
diverse
influences
had
gone
to
the
making
here
beethoven
after
humming
and
hawing
with
great
sweetness
said
heigho
and
the
andante
came
to
an
end
applause
and
a
round
of
wunderschoning
and
prachtvolleying
from
the
german
contingent
margaret
started
talking
to
her
new
young
man
helen
said
to
her
aunt
now
comes
the
wonderful
movement
first
of
all
the
goblins
and
then
a
trio
of
elephants
dancing
and
tibby
implored
the
company
generally
to
look
out
for
the
transitional
passage
on
the
drum
on
the
what
dear
on
the
drum
aunt
juley
no
look
out
for
the
part
where
you
think
you
have
done
with
the
goblins
and
they
come
back
breathed
helen
as
the
music
started
with
a
goblin
walking
quietly
over
the
universe
from
end
to
end
others
followed
him
they
were
not
aggressive
creatures
it
was
that
that
made
them
so
terrible
to
helen
they
merely
observed
in
passing
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
splendour
or
heroism
in
the
world
after
the
interlude
of
elephants
dancing
they
returned
and
made
the
observation
for
the
second
time
helen
could
not
contradict
them
for
once
at
all
events
she
had
felt
the
same
and
had
seen
the
reliable
walls
of
youth
collapse
panic
and
emptiness
panic
and
emptiness
the
goblins
were
right
her
brother
raised
his
finger
it
was
the
transitional
passage
on
the
drum
for
as
if
things
were
going
too
far
beethoven
took
hold
of
the
goblins
and
made
them
do
what
he
wanted
he
appeared
in
person
he
gave
them
a
little
push
and
they
began
to
walk
in
major
key
instead
of
in
a
minor
and
then
he
blew
with
his
mouth
and
they
were
scattered
gusts
of
splendour
gods
and
demigods
contending
with
vast
swords
colour
and
fragrance
broadcast
on
the
field
of
battle
magnificent
victory
magnificent
death
oh
it
all
burst
before
the
girl
and
she
even
stretched
out
her
gloved
hands
as
if
it
was
tangible
any
fate
was
titanic
any
contest
desirable
conqueror
and
conquered
would
alike
be
applauded
by
the
angels
of
the
utmost
stars
and
the
goblins
they
had
not
really
been
there
at
all
they
were
only
the
phantoms
of
cowardice
and
unbelief
one
healthy
human
impulse
would
dispel
them
men
like
the
wilcoxes
or
president
roosevelt
would
say
yes
beethoven
knew
better
the
goblins
really
had
been
there
they
might
return
and
they
did
it
was
as
if
the
splendour
of
life
might
boil
over
and
waste
to
steam
and
froth
in
its
dissolution
one
heard
the
terrible
ominous
note
and
a
goblin
with
increased
malignity
walked
quietly
over
the
universe
from
end
to
end
panic
and
emptiness
panic
and
emptiness
even
the
flaming
ramparts
of
the
world
might
fall
beethoven
chose
to
make
all
right
in
the
end
he
built
the
ramparts
up
he
blew
with
his
mouth
for
the
second
time
and
again
the
goblins
were
scattered
he
brought
back
the
gusts
of
splendour
the
heroism
the
youth
the
magnificence
of
life
and
of
death
and
amid
vast
roarings
of
a
superhuman
joy
he
led
his
fifth
symphony
to
its
conclusion
but
the
goblins
were
there
they
could
return
he
had
said
so
bravely
and
that
is
why
one
can
trust
beethoven
when
he
says
other
things
helen
pushed
her
way
out
during
the
applause
she
desired
to
be
alone
the
music
summed
up
to
her
all
that
had
happened
or
could
happen
in
her
career
she
read
it
as
a
tangible
statement
which
could
never
be
superseded
the
notes
meant
this
and
that
to
her
and
they
could
have
no
other
meaning
and
life
could
have
no
other
meaning
she
pushed
right
out
of
the
building
and
walked
slowly
down
the
outside
staircase
breathing
the
autumnal
air
and
then
she
strolled
home
margaret
called
munt
is
helen
all
right
oh
yes
she
is
always
going
away
in
the
middle
of
a
programme
said
tibby
the
music
has
evidently
moved
her
deeply
said
fraulein
mosebach
excuse
me
said
margaret
young
man
who
had
for
some
time
been
preparing
a
sentence
but
that
lady
has
quite
inadvertently
taken
my
umbrella
oh
good
gracious
me
i
am
so
sorry
tibby
run
after
helen
i
shall
miss
the
four
serious
songs
if
i
do
tibby
love
you
must
go
it
is
of
any
consequence
said
the
young
man
in
truth
a
little
uneasy
about
his
umbrella
but
of
course
it
is
tibby
tibby
tibby
rose
to
his
feet
and
wilfully
caught
his
person
on
the
backs
of
the
chairs
by
the
time
he
had
tipped
up
the
seat
and
had
found
his
hat
and
had
deposited
his
full
score
in
safety
it
was
too
late
to
go
after
helen
the
four
serious
songs
had
begun
and
one
could
not
move
during
their
performance
my
sister
is
so
careless
whispered
margaret
not
at
all
replied
the
young
man
but
his
voice
was
dead
and
cold
if
you
would
give
me
your
address
oh
not
at
all
not
at
all
and
he
wrapped
his
greatcoat
over
his
knees
then
the
four
serious
songs
rang
shallow
in
ears
brahms
for
all
his
grumbling
and
grizzling
had
never
guessed
what
it
felt
like
to
be
suspected
of
stealing
an
umbrella
for
this
fool
of
a
young
man
thought
that
she
and
helen
and
tibby
had
been
playing
the
confidence
trick
on
him
and
that
if
he
gave
his
address
they
would
break
into
his
rooms
some
midnight
or
other
and
steal
his
walkingstick
too
most
ladies
would
have
laughed
but
margaret
really
minded
for
it
gave
her
a
glimpse
into
squalor
to
trust
people
is
a
luxury
in
which
only
the
wealthy
can
indulge
the
poor
can
not
afford
it
as
soon
as
brahms
had
grunted
himself
out
she
gave
him
her
card
and
said
that
is
where
we
live
if
you
preferred
you
could
call
for
the
umbrella
after
the
concert
but
i
did
like
to
trouble
you
when
it
has
all
been
our
fault
his
face
brightened
a
little
when
he
saw
that
wickham
place
was
it
was
sad
to
see
him
corroded
with
suspicion
and
yet
not
daring
to
be
impolite
in
case
these
people
were
honest
after
all
she
took
it
as
a
good
sign
that
he
said
to
her
it
a
fine
programme
this
afternoon
is
it
not
for
this
was
the
remark
with
which
he
had
originally
opened
before
the
umbrella
intervened
the
beethoven
fine
said
margaret
who
was
not
a
female
of
the
encouraging
type
i
do
like
the
brahms
though
nor
the
mendelssohn
that
came
first
and
ugh
i
do
like
this
elgar
that
coming
what
what
called
herr
liesecke
overhearing
the
pomp
and
circumstance
will
not
be
fine
oh
margaret
you
tiresome
girl
cried
her
aunt
here
have
i
been
persuading
herr
liesecke
to
stop
for
pomp
and
circumstance
and
you
are
undoing
all
my
work
i
am
so
anxious
for
him
to
hear
what
we
are
doing
in
music
oh
you
must
run
down
our
english
composers
margaret
for
my
part
i
have
heard
the
composition
at
stettin
said
fraulein
mosebach
on
two
occasions
it
is
dramatic
a
little
frieda
you
despise
english
music
you
know
you
do
and
english
art
and
english
literature
except
shakespeare
and
he
a
german
very
well
frieda
you
may
go
the
lovers
laughed
and
glanced
at
each
other
moved
by
a
common
impulse
they
rose
to
their
feet
and
fled
from
pomp
and
circumstance
we
have
this
call
to
play
in
finsbury
circus
it
is
true
said
herr
liesecke
as
he
edged
past
her
and
reached
the
gangway
just
as
the
music
started
margaret
loudly
whispered
by
aunt
juley
margaret
margaret
fraulein
mosebach
has
left
her
beautiful
little
bag
behind
her
on
the
seat
sure
enough
there
was
frieda
reticule
containing
her
address
book
her
pocket
dictionary
her
map
of
london
and
her
money
oh
what
a
bother
what
a
family
we
are
hush
said
all
those
who
thought
the
music
fine
but
it
the
number
they
want
in
finsbury
circus
might
i
could
i
said
the
suspicious
young
man
and
got
very
red
oh
i
would
be
so
grateful
he
took
the
bag
money
clinking
inside
it
and
slipped
up
the
gangway
with
it
he
was
just
in
time
to
catch
them
at
the
and
he
received
a
pretty
smile
from
the
german
girl
and
a
fine
bow
from
her
cavalier
he
returned
to
his
seat
with
the
world
the
trust
that
they
had
reposed
in
him
was
trivial
but
he
felt
that
it
cancelled
his
mistrust
for
them
and
that
probably
he
would
not
be
had
over
his
umbrella
this
young
man
had
been
had
in
the
past
badly
perhaps
overwhelmingly
and
now
most
of
his
energies
went
in
defending
himself
against
the
unknown
but
this
afternoon
perhaps
on
account
of
music
he
perceived
that
one
must
slack
off
occasionally
or
what
is
the
good
of
being
alive
wickham
place
though
a
risk
was
as
safe
as
most
things
and
he
would
risk
it
so
when
the
concert
was
over
and
margaret
said
we
live
quite
near
i
am
going
there
now
could
you
walk
around
with
me
and
we
find
your
umbrella
he
said
thank
you
peaceably
and
followed
her
out
of
the
queen
hall
she
wished
that
he
was
not
so
anxious
to
hand
a
lady
downstairs
or
to
carry
a
lady
programme
for
her
his
class
was
near
enough
her
own
for
its
manners
to
vex
her
but
she
found
him
interesting
on
the
whole
every
one
interested
the
schlegels
on
the
whole
at
that
time
and
while
her
lips
talked
culture
her
heart
was
planning
to
invite
him
to
tea
how
tired
one
gets
after
music
she
began
do
you
find
the
atmosphere
of
queen
hall
oppressive
yes
horribly
but
surely
the
atmosphere
of
covent
garden
is
even
more
oppressive
do
you
go
there
much
when
my
work
permits
i
attend
the
gallery
for
the
royal
opera
helen
would
have
exclaimed
so
do
i
love
the
gallery
and
thus
have
endeared
herself
to
the
young
man
helen
could
do
these
things
but
margaret
had
an
almost
morbid
horror
of
drawing
people
out
of
making
things
go
she
had
been
to
the
gallery
at
covent
garden
but
she
did
not
attend
it
preferring
the
more
expensive
seats
still
less
did
she
love
it
so
she
made
no
reply
this
year
i
have
been
three
times
to
faust
tosca
and
was
it
tannhouser
or
tannhoyser
better
not
risk
the
word
margaret
disliked
tosca
and
faust
and
so
for
one
reason
and
another
they
walked
on
in
silence
chaperoned
by
the
voice
of
munt
who
was
getting
into
difficulties
with
her
nephew
i
do
in
a
way
remember
the
passage
tibby
but
when
every
instrument
is
so
beautiful
it
is
difficult
to
pick
out
one
thing
rather
than
another
i
am
sure
that
you
and
helen
take
me
to
the
very
nicest
concerts
not
a
dull
note
from
beginning
to
end
i
only
wish
that
our
german
friends
would
have
stayed
till
it
finished
but
surely
you
have
forgotten
the
drum
steadily
beating
on
the
low
c
aunt
juley
came
tibby
voice
no
one
could
it
unmistakable
a
specially
loud
part
hazarded
munt
of
course
i
do
not
go
in
for
being
musical
she
added
the
shot
failing
i
only
care
for
music
a
very
different
thing
but
still
i
will
say
this
for
myself
i
do
know
when
i
like
a
thing
and
when
i
do
some
people
are
the
same
about
pictures
they
can
go
into
a
picture
gallery
miss
conder
can
and
say
straight
off
what
they
feel
all
round
the
wall
i
never
could
do
that
but
music
is
so
different
to
pictures
to
my
mind
when
it
comes
to
music
i
am
as
safe
as
houses
and
i
assure
you
tibby
i
am
by
no
means
pleased
by
everything
there
was
a
thing
something
about
a
faun
in
french
which
helen
went
into
ecstasies
over
but
i
thought
it
most
tinkling
and
superficial
and
said
so
and
i
held
to
my
opinion
too
do
you
agree
asked
margaret
do
you
think
music
is
so
different
to
pictures
i
i
should
have
thought
so
kind
of
he
said
so
should
i
now
my
sister
declares
they
just
the
same
we
have
great
arguments
over
it
she
says
i
dense
i
say
she
sloppy
getting
under
way
she
cried
now
does
it
seem
absurd
to
you
what
is
the
good
of
the
arts
if
they
are
interchangeable
what
is
the
good
of
the
ear
if
it
tells
you
the
same
as
the
eye
helen
one
aim
is
to
translate
tunes
into
the
language
of
painting
and
pictures
into
the
language
of
music
it
very
ingenious
and
she
says
several
pretty
things
in
the
process
but
gained
i
like
to
know
oh
it
all
rubbish
radically
false
if
monet
really
debussy
and
debussy
really
monet
neither
gentleman
is
worth
his
salt
that
my
opinion
evidently
these
sisters
quarrelled
now
this
very
symphony
that
we
just
been
having
she
wo
let
it
alone
she
labels
it
with
meanings
from
start
to
finish
turns
it
into
literature
i
wonder
if
the
day
will
ever
return
when
music
will
be
treated
as
music
yet
i
do
know
there
my
brother
behind
us
he
treats
music
as
music
and
oh
my
goodness
he
makes
me
angrier
than
anyone
simply
furious
with
him
i
even
argue
an
unhappy
family
if
talented
but
of
course
the
real
villain
is
wagner
he
has
done
more
than
any
man
in
the
nineteenth
century
towards
the
muddling
of
arts
i
do
feel
that
music
is
in
a
very
serious
state
just
now
though
extraordinarily
interesting
every
now
and
then
in
history
there
do
come
these
terrible
geniuses
like
wagner
who
stir
up
all
the
wells
of
thought
at
once
for
a
moment
it
splendid
such
a
splash
as
never
was
but
afterwards
such
a
lot
of
mud
and
the
wells
as
it
were
they
communicate
with
each
other
too
easily
now
and
not
one
of
them
will
run
quite
clear
that
what
wagner
done
her
speeches
fluttered
away
from
the
young
man
like
birds
if
only
he
could
talk
like
this
he
would
have
caught
the
world
oh
to
acquire
culture
oh
to
pronounce
foreign
names
correctly
oh
to
be
well
informed
discoursing
at
ease
on
every
subject
that
a
lady
started
but
it
would
take
one
years
with
an
hour
at
lunch
and
a
few
shattered
hours
in
the
evening
how
was
it
possible
to
catch
up
with
leisured
women
who
had
been
reading
steadily
from
childhood
his
brain
might
be
full
of
names
he
might
have
even
heard
of
monet
and
debussy
the
trouble
was
that
he
could
not
string
them
together
into
a
sentence
he
could
not
make
them
tell
he
could
not
quite
forget
about
his
stolen
umbrella
yes
the
umbrella
was
the
real
trouble
behind
monet
and
debussy
the
umbrella
persisted
with
the
steady
beat
of
a
drum
i
suppose
my
umbrella
will
be
all
right
he
was
thinking
i
do
really
mind
about
it
i
will
think
about
music
instead
i
suppose
my
umbrella
will
be
all
right
earlier
in
the
afternoon
he
had
worried
about
seats
ought
he
to
have
paid
as
much
as
two
shillings
earlier
still
he
had
wondered
shall
i
try
to
do
without
a
programme
there
had
always
been
something
to
worry
him
ever
since
he
could
remember
always
something
that
distracted
him
in
the
pursuit
of
beauty
for
he
did
pursue
beauty
and
therefore
margaret
speeches
did
flutter
away
from
him
like
birds
margaret
talked
ahead
occasionally
saying
do
you
think
so
do
you
feel
the
same
and
once
she
stopped
and
said
oh
do
interrupt
me
which
terrified
him
she
did
not
attract
him
though
she
filled
him
with
awe
her
figure
was
meagre
her
face
seemed
all
teeth
and
eyes
her
references
to
her
sister
and
brother
were
uncharitable
for
all
her
cleverness
and
culture
she
was
probably
one
of
those
soulless
atheistical
women
who
have
been
so
shown
up
by
miss
corelli
it
was
surprising
and
alarming
that
she
should
suddenly
say
i
do
hope
that
you
come
in
and
have
some
tea
i
do
hope
that
you
come
in
and
have
some
tea
we
should
be
so
glad
i
have
dragged
you
so
far
out
of
your
way
they
had
arrived
at
wickham
place
the
sun
had
set
and
the
backwater
in
deep
shadow
was
filling
with
a
gentle
haze
to
the
right
of
the
fantastic
skyline
of
the
flats
towered
black
against
the
hues
of
evening
to
the
left
the
older
houses
raised
a
irregular
parapet
against
the
grey
margaret
fumbled
for
her
latchkey
of
course
she
had
forgotten
it
so
grasping
her
umbrella
by
its
ferrule
she
leant
over
the
area
and
tapped
at
the
window
helen
let
us
in
all
right
said
a
voice
you
been
taking
this
gentleman
umbrella
taken
a
what
said
helen
opening
the
door
oh
what
that
do
come
in
how
do
you
do
helen
you
must
not
be
so
ramshackly
you
took
this
gentleman
umbrella
away
from
queen
hall
and
he
has
had
the
trouble
of
coming
for
it
oh
i
am
so
sorry
cried
helen
all
her
hair
flying
she
had
pulled
off
her
hat
as
soon
as
she
returned
and
had
flung
herself
into
the
big
chair
i
do
nothing
but
steal
umbrellas
i
am
so
very
sorry
do
come
in
and
choose
one
is
yours
a
hooky
or
a
nobbly
mine
a
nobbly
at
least
i
think
it
is
the
light
was
turned
on
and
they
began
to
search
the
hall
helen
who
had
abruptly
parted
with
the
fifth
symphony
commenting
with
shrill
little
cries
do
you
talk
meg
you
stole
an
old
gentleman
silk
yes
she
did
aunt
juley
it
is
a
positive
fact
she
thought
it
was
a
muff
oh
heavens
i
knocked
the
in
and
out
card
down
where
frieda
tibby
why
do
you
ever
no
i
ca
remember
what
i
was
going
to
say
that
was
it
but
do
tell
the
maids
to
hurry
tea
up
what
about
this
umbrella
she
opened
it
no
it
all
gone
along
the
seams
it
an
appalling
umbrella
it
must
be
mine
but
it
was
not
he
took
it
from
her
murmured
a
few
words
of
thanks
and
then
fled
with
the
lilting
step
of
the
clerk
but
if
you
will
stop
cried
margaret
now
helen
how
stupid
you
been
whatever
have
i
done
do
you
see
that
you
frightened
him
away
i
meant
him
to
stop
to
tea
you
ought
to
talk
about
stealing
or
holes
in
an
umbrella
i
saw
his
nice
eyes
getting
so
miserable
no
it
not
a
bit
of
good
now
for
helen
had
darted
out
into
the
street
shouting
oh
do
stop
i
dare
say
it
is
all
for
the
best
opined
munt
we
know
nothing
about
the
young
man
margaret
and
your
is
full
of
very
tempting
little
things
but
helen
cried
aunt
juley
how
can
you
you
make
me
more
and
more
ashamed
i
rather
he
had
been
a
thief
and
taken
all
the
apostle
spoons
than
that
i
well
i
must
shut
the
i
suppose
one
more
failure
for
helen
yes
i
think
the
apostle
spoons
could
have
gone
as
rent
said
margaret
seeing
that
her
aunt
did
not
understand
she
added
you
remember
it
was
one
of
father
words
rent
to
the
ideal
to
his
own
faith
in
human
nature
you
remember
how
he
would
trust
strangers
and
if
they
fooled
him
he
would
say
better
to
be
fooled
than
to
be
suspicious
that
the
confidence
trick
is
the
work
of
man
but
the
is
the
work
of
the
devil
i
remember
something
of
the
sort
now
said
munt
rather
tartly
for
she
longed
to
add
it
was
lucky
that
your
father
married
a
wife
with
money
but
this
was
unkind
and
she
contented
herself
with
why
he
might
have
stolen
the
little
ricketts
picture
as
well
better
that
he
had
said
helen
stoutly
no
i
agree
with
aunt
juley
said
margaret
rather
mistrust
people
than
lose
my
little
ricketts
there
are
limits
their
brother
finding
the
incident
commonplace
had
stolen
upstairs
to
see
whether
there
were
scones
for
tea
he
warmed
the
teapot
almost
too
deftly
rejected
the
orange
pekoe
that
the
had
provided
poured
in
five
spoonfuls
of
a
superior
blend
filled
up
with
really
boiling
water
and
now
called
to
the
ladies
to
be
quick
or
they
would
lose
the
aroma
all
right
auntie
tibby
called
helen
while
margaret
thoughtful
again
said
in
a
way
i
wish
we
had
a
real
boy
in
the
house
the
kind
of
boy
who
cares
for
men
it
would
make
entertaining
so
much
easier
so
do
i
said
her
sister
tibby
only
cares
for
cultured
females
singing
brahms
and
when
they
joined
him
she
said
rather
sharply
why
did
you
make
that
young
man
welcome
tibby
you
must
do
the
host
a
little
you
know
you
ought
to
have
taken
his
hat
and
coaxed
him
into
stopping
instead
of
letting
him
be
swamped
by
screaming
women
tibby
sighed
and
drew
a
long
strand
of
hair
over
his
forehead
oh
it
no
good
looking
superior
i
mean
what
i
say
leave
tibby
alone
said
margaret
who
could
not
bear
her
brother
to
be
scolded
here
the
house
a
regular
grumbled
helen
oh
my
dear
protested
munt
how
can
you
say
such
dreadful
things
the
number
of
men
you
get
here
has
always
astonished
me
if
there
is
any
danger
it
the
other
way
round
yes
but
it
the
wrong
sort
of
men
helen
means
no
i
do
corrected
helen
we
get
the
right
sort
of
man
but
the
wrong
side
of
him
and
i
say
that
fault
there
ought
to
be
a
something
about
the
house
an
i
do
know
what
a
touch
of
the
perhaps
helen
put
out
her
tongue
who
are
the
asked
tibby
the
are
things
i
and
meg
and
aunt
juley
know
about
and
you
do
so
there
i
suppose
that
ours
is
a
female
house
said
margaret
and
one
must
just
accept
it
no
aunt
juley
i
do
mean
that
this
house
is
full
of
women
i
am
trying
to
say
something
much
more
clever
i
mean
that
it
was
irrevocably
feminine
even
in
father
time
now
i
sure
you
understand
well
i
give
you
another
example
shock
you
but
i
do
care
suppose
queen
victoria
gave
a
and
that
the
guests
had
been
leighton
millais
swinburne
rossetti
meredith
fitzgerald
etc
do
you
suppose
that
the
atmosphere
of
that
dinner
would
have
been
artistic
heavens
no
the
very
chairs
on
which
they
sat
would
have
seen
to
that
so
with
our
house
it
must
be
feminine
and
all
we
can
do
is
to
see
that
it
effeminate
just
as
another
house
that
i
can
mention
but
i
wo
sounded
irrevocably
masculine
and
all
its
inmates
can
do
is
to
see
that
it
is
brutal
that
house
being
the
house
i
presume
said
tibby
you
not
going
to
be
told
about
the
my
child
helen
cried
so
do
you
think
it
and
on
the
other
hand
i
do
the
least
mind
if
you
find
out
so
do
you
think
you
done
anything
clever
in
either
case
give
me
a
cigarette
you
do
what
you
can
for
the
house
said
margaret
the
reeks
of
smoke
if
you
smoked
too
the
house
might
suddenly
turn
masculine
atmosphere
is
probably
a
question
of
touch
and
go
even
at
queen
victoria
if
something
had
been
just
a
little
different
perhaps
if
she
worn
a
clinging
liberty
instead
of
a
magenta
satin
with
an
indian
shawl
over
her
shoulders
fastened
at
the
bosom
with
a
bursts
of
disloyal
laughter
you
must
remember
that
they
are
half
german
greeted
these
suggestions
and
margaret
said
pensively
how
inconceivable
it
would
be
if
the
royal
family
cared
about
art
and
the
conversation
drifted
away
and
away
and
helen
cigarette
turned
to
a
spot
in
the
darkness
and
the
great
flats
opposite
were
sown
with
lighted
windows
which
vanished
and
were
relit
again
and
vanished
incessantly
beyond
them
the
thoroughfare
roared
gently
a
tide
that
could
never
be
quiet
while
in
the
east
invisible
behind
the
smokes
of
wapping
the
moon
was
rising
that
reminds
me
margaret
we
might
have
taken
that
young
man
into
the
at
all
events
only
the
majolica
plate
and
that
is
so
firmly
set
in
the
wall
i
am
really
distressed
that
he
had
no
tea
for
that
little
incident
had
impressed
the
three
women
more
than
might
be
supposed
it
remained
as
a
goblin
football
as
a
hint
that
all
is
not
for
the
best
in
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
and
that
beneath
these
superstructures
of
wealth
and
art
there
wanders
an
boy
who
has
recovered
his
umbrella
indeed
but
who
has
left
no
address
behind
him
and
no
name
chapter
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
very
poor
they
are
unthinkable
and
only
to
be
approached
by
the
statistician
or
the
poet
this
story
deals
with
gentlefolk
or
with
those
who
are
obliged
to
pretend
that
they
are
gentlefolk
the
boy
leonard
bast
stood
at
the
extreme
verge
of
gentility
he
was
not
in
the
abyss
but
he
could
see
it
and
at
times
people
whom
he
knew
had
dropped
in
and
counted
no
more
he
knew
that
he
was
poor
and
would
admit
it
he
would
have
died
sooner
than
confess
any
inferiority
to
the
rich
this
may
be
splendid
of
him
but
he
was
inferior
to
most
rich
people
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
he
was
not
as
courteous
as
the
average
rich
man
nor
as
intelligent
nor
as
healthy
nor
as
lovable
his
mind
and
his
body
had
been
alike
underfed
because
he
was
poor
and
because
he
was
modern
they
were
always
craving
better
food
had
he
lived
some
centuries
ago
in
the
brightly
coloured
civilizations
of
the
past
he
would
have
had
a
definite
status
his
rank
and
his
income
would
have
corresponded
but
in
his
day
the
angel
of
democracy
had
arisen
enshadowing
the
classes
with
leathern
wings
and
proclaiming
all
men
are
equal
all
men
that
is
to
say
who
possess
umbrellas
and
so
he
was
obliged
to
assert
gentility
lest
he
slipped
into
the
abyss
where
nothing
counts
and
the
statements
of
democracy
are
inaudible
as
he
walked
away
from
wickham
place
his
first
care
was
to
prove
that
he
was
as
good
as
the
miss
schlegels
obscurely
wounded
in
his
pride
he
tried
to
wound
them
in
return
they
were
probably
not
ladies
would
real
ladies
have
asked
him
to
tea
they
were
certainly
and
cold
at
each
step
his
feeling
of
superiority
increased
would
a
real
lady
have
talked
about
stealing
an
umbrella
perhaps
they
were
thieves
after
all
and
if
he
had
gone
into
the
house
they
could
have
clapped
a
chloroformed
handkerchief
over
his
face
he
walked
on
complacently
as
far
as
the
houses
of
parliament
there
an
empty
stomach
asserted
itself
and
told
him
he
was
a
fool
evening
mr
bast
evening
mr
dealtry
nice
evening
evening
dealtry
a
fellow
clerk
passed
on
and
leonard
stood
wondering
whether
he
would
take
the
tram
as
far
as
a
penny
would
take
him
or
whether
he
would
walk
he
decided
to
walk
it
is
no
good
giving
in
and
he
had
spent
money
enough
at
queen
hall
and
he
walked
over
westminster
bridge
in
front
of
thomas
hospital
and
through
the
immense
tunnel
that
passes
under
the
main
line
at
vauxhall
in
the
tunnel
he
paused
and
listened
to
the
roar
of
the
trains
a
sharp
pain
darted
through
his
head
and
he
was
conscious
of
the
exact
form
of
his
eye
sockets
he
pushed
on
for
another
mile
and
did
not
slacken
speed
until
he
stood
at
the
entrance
of
a
road
called
camelia
road
which
was
at
present
his
home
here
he
stopped
again
and
glanced
suspiciously
to
right
and
left
like
a
rabbit
that
is
going
to
bolt
into
its
hole
a
block
of
flats
constructed
with
extreme
cheapness
towered
on
either
hand
farther
down
the
road
two
more
blocks
were
being
built
and
beyond
these
an
old
house
was
being
demolished
to
accommodate
another
pair
it
was
the
kind
of
scene
that
may
be
observed
all
over
london
whatever
the
locality
bricks
and
mortar
rising
and
falling
with
the
restlessness
of
the
water
in
a
fountain
as
the
city
receives
more
and
more
men
upon
her
soil
camelia
road
would
soon
stand
out
like
a
fortress
and
command
for
a
little
an
extensive
view
only
for
a
little
plans
were
out
for
the
erection
of
flats
in
magnolia
road
also
and
again
a
few
years
and
all
the
flats
in
either
road
might
be
pulled
down
and
new
buildings
of
a
vastness
at
present
unimaginable
might
arise
where
they
had
fallen
evening
mr
bast
evening
mr
cunningham
very
serious
thing
this
decline
of
the
in
manchester
i
beg
your
pardon
very
serious
thing
this
decline
of
the
in
manchester
repeated
cunningham
tapping
the
sunday
paper
in
which
the
calamity
in
question
had
just
been
announced
to
him
ah
yes
said
leonard
who
was
not
going
to
let
on
that
he
had
not
bought
a
sunday
paper
if
this
kind
of
thing
goes
on
the
population
of
england
will
be
stationary
in
you
do
say
so
i
call
it
a
very
serious
thing
eh
mr
cunningham
mr
bast
then
leonard
entered
block
b
of
the
flats
and
turned
not
upstairs
but
down
into
what
is
known
to
house
agents
as
a
and
to
other
men
as
a
cellar
he
opened
the
door
and
cried
hullo
with
the
of
the
cockney
there
was
no
reply
hullo
he
repeated
the
was
empty
though
the
electric
light
had
been
left
burning
a
look
of
relief
came
over
his
face
and
he
flung
himself
into
the
armchair
the
contained
besides
the
armchair
two
other
chairs
a
piano
a
table
and
a
cosy
corner
of
the
walls
one
was
occupied
by
the
window
the
other
by
a
draped
mantelshelf
bristling
with
cupids
opposite
the
window
was
the
door
and
beside
the
door
a
bookcase
while
over
the
piano
there
extended
one
of
the
masterpieces
of
maud
goodman
it
was
an
amorous
and
not
unpleasant
little
hole
when
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
the
lights
turned
on
and
the
unlit
but
it
struck
that
shallow
makeshift
note
that
is
so
often
heard
in
the
modem
it
had
been
too
easily
gained
and
could
be
relinquished
too
easily
as
leonard
was
kicking
off
his
boots
he
jarred
the
table
and
a
photograph
frame
honourably
poised
upon
it
slid
sideways
fell
off
into
the
fireplace
and
smashed
he
swore
in
a
colourless
sort
of
way
and
picked
the
photograph
up
it
represented
a
young
lady
called
jacky
and
had
been
taken
at
the
time
when
young
ladies
called
jacky
were
often
photographed
with
their
mouths
open
teeth
of
dazzling
whiteness
extended
along
either
of
jacky
jaws
and
positively
weighted
her
head
sideways
so
large
were
they
and
so
numerous
take
my
word
for
it
that
smile
was
simply
stunning
and
it
is
only
you
and
i
who
will
be
fastidious
and
complain
that
true
joy
begins
in
the
eyes
and
that
the
eyes
of
jacky
did
not
accord
with
her
smile
but
were
anxious
and
hungry
leonard
tried
to
pull
out
the
fragments
of
glass
and
cut
his
fingers
and
swore
again
a
drop
of
blood
fell
on
the
frame
another
followed
spilling
over
on
to
the
exposed
photograph
he
swore
more
vigorously
and
dashed
to
the
kitchen
where
he
bathed
his
hands
the
kitchen
was
the
same
size
as
the
sitting
room
through
it
was
a
bedroom
this
completed
his
home
he
was
renting
the
flat
furnished
of
all
the
objects
that
encumbered
it
none
were
his
own
except
the
photograph
frame
the
cupids
and
the
books
damn
damn
damnation
he
murmured
together
with
such
other
words
as
he
had
learnt
from
older
men
then
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
said
oh
damn
it
all
which
meant
something
different
he
pulled
himself
together
he
drank
a
little
tea
black
and
silent
that
still
survived
upon
an
upper
shelf
he
swallowed
some
dusty
crumbs
of
cake
then
he
went
back
to
the
settled
himself
anew
and
began
to
read
a
volume
of
ruskin
seven
miles
to
the
north
of
venice
how
perfectly
the
famous
chapter
opens
how
supreme
its
command
of
admonition
and
of
poetry
the
rich
man
is
speaking
to
us
from
his
gondola
seven
miles
to
the
north
of
venice
the
banks
of
sand
which
nearer
the
city
rise
little
above
mark
attain
by
degrees
a
higher
level
and
knit
themselves
at
last
into
fields
of
salt
morass
raised
here
and
there
into
shapeless
mounds
and
intercepted
by
narrow
creeks
of
sea
leonard
was
trying
to
form
his
style
on
ruskin
he
understood
him
to
be
the
greatest
master
of
english
prose
he
read
forward
steadily
occasionally
making
a
few
notes
let
us
consider
a
little
each
of
these
characters
in
succession
and
first
for
of
the
shafts
enough
has
been
said
already
what
is
very
peculiar
to
this
church
its
luminousness
was
there
anything
to
be
learnt
from
this
fine
sentence
could
he
adapt
it
to
the
needs
of
daily
life
could
he
introduce
it
with
modifications
when
he
next
wrote
a
letter
to
his
brother
the
for
example
let
us
consider
a
little
each
of
these
characters
in
succession
and
first
for
of
the
absence
of
ventilation
enough
has
been
said
already
what
is
very
peculiar
to
this
flat
its
something
told
him
that
the
modifications
would
not
do
and
that
something
had
he
known
it
was
the
spirit
of
english
prose
my
flat
is
dark
as
well
as
stuffy
those
were
the
words
for
him
and
the
voice
in
the
gondola
rolled
on
piping
melodiously
of
effort
and
full
of
high
purpose
full
of
beauty
full
even
of
sympathy
and
the
love
of
men
yet
somehow
eluding
all
that
was
actual
and
insistent
in
leonard
life
for
it
was
the
voice
of
one
who
had
never
been
dirty
or
hungry
and
had
not
guessed
successfully
what
dirt
and
hunger
are
leonard
listened
to
it
with
reverence
he
felt
that
he
was
being
done
good
to
and
that
if
he
kept
on
with
ruskin
and
the
queen
hall
concerts
and
some
pictures
by
watts
he
would
one
day
push
his
head
out
of
the
grey
waters
and
see
the
universe
he
believed
in
sudden
conversion
a
belief
which
may
be
right
but
which
is
peculiarly
attractive
to
a
mind
it
is
the
bias
of
much
popular
religion
in
the
domain
of
business
it
dominates
the
stock
exchange
and
becomes
that
bit
of
luck
by
which
all
successes
and
failures
are
explained
if
only
i
had
a
bit
of
luck
the
whole
thing
would
come
straight
got
a
most
magnificent
place
down
at
streatham
and
a
fiat
but
then
mind
you
he
had
luck
sorry
the
wife
so
late
but
she
never
has
any
luck
over
catching
trains
leonard
was
superior
to
these
people
he
did
believe
in
effort
and
in
a
steady
preparation
for
the
change
that
he
desired
but
of
a
heritage
that
may
expand
gradually
he
had
no
conception
he
hoped
to
come
to
culture
suddenly
much
as
the
revivalist
hopes
to
come
to
jesus
those
miss
schlegels
had
come
to
it
they
had
done
the
trick
their
hands
were
upon
the
ropes
once
and
for
all
and
meanwhile
his
flat
was
dark
as
well
as
stuffy
presently
there
was
a
noise
on
the
staircase
he
shut
up
margaret
card
in
the
pages
of
ruskin
and
opened
the
door
a
woman
entered
of
whom
it
is
simplest
to
say
that
she
was
not
respectable
her
appearance
was
awesome
she
seemed
all
strings
and
ribbons
chains
bead
necklaces
that
clinked
and
caught
and
a
boa
of
azure
feathers
hung
round
her
neck
with
the
ends
uneven
her
throat
was
bare
wound
with
a
double
row
of
pearls
her
arms
were
bare
to
the
elbows
and
might
again
be
detected
at
the
shoulder
through
cheap
lace
her
hat
which
was
flowery
resembled
those
punnets
covered
with
flannel
which
we
sowed
with
mustard
and
cress
in
our
childhood
and
which
germinated
here
yes
and
there
no
she
wore
it
on
the
back
of
her
head
as
for
her
hair
or
rather
hairs
they
are
too
complicated
to
describe
but
one
system
went
down
her
back
lying
in
a
thick
pad
there
while
another
created
for
a
lighter
destiny
rippled
around
her
forehead
the
face
the
face
does
not
signify
it
was
the
face
of
the
photograph
but
older
and
the
teeth
were
not
so
numerous
as
the
photographer
had
suggested
and
certainly
not
so
white
yes
jacky
was
past
her
prime
whatever
that
prime
may
have
been
she
was
descending
quicker
than
most
women
into
the
colourless
years
and
the
look
in
her
eyes
confessed
it
what
ho
said
leonard
greeting
that
apparition
with
much
spirit
and
helping
it
off
with
its
boa
jacky
in
husky
tones
replied
what
ho
been
out
he
asked
the
question
sounds
superfluous
but
it
can
not
have
been
really
for
the
lady
answered
no
adding
oh
i
am
so
tired
you
tired
eh
i
tired
said
he
hanging
the
boa
up
oh
len
i
am
so
tired
i
been
to
that
classical
concert
i
told
you
about
said
leonard
what
that
i
came
back
as
soon
as
it
was
over
any
one
been
round
to
our
place
asked
jacky
not
that
i
seen
i
met
cunningham
outside
and
we
passed
a
few
remarks
what
not
mr
cunnginham
yes
oh
you
mean
mr
cunningham
yes
mr
cunningham
i
been
out
to
tea
at
a
lady
friend
her
secret
being
at
last
given
to
the
world
and
the
name
of
the
being
even
adumbrated
jacky
made
no
further
experiments
in
the
difficult
and
tiring
art
of
conversation
she
never
had
been
a
great
talker
even
in
her
photographic
days
she
had
relied
upon
her
smile
and
her
figure
to
attract
and
now
that
she
was
on
the
shelf
on
the
shelf
boys
boys
i
on
the
shelf
she
was
not
likely
to
find
her
tongue
occasional
bursts
of
song
of
which
the
above
is
an
example
still
issued
from
her
lips
but
the
spoken
word
was
rare
she
sat
down
on
leonard
knee
and
began
to
fondle
him
she
was
now
a
massive
woman
of
and
her
weight
hurt
him
but
he
could
not
very
well
say
anything
then
she
said
is
that
a
book
you
reading
and
he
said
that
a
book
and
drew
it
from
her
unreluctant
grasp
margaret
card
fell
out
of
it
it
fell
face
downwards
and
he
murmured
bookmarker
len
what
is
it
he
asked
a
little
wearily
for
she
only
had
one
topic
of
conversation
when
she
sat
upon
his
knee
you
do
love
me
jacky
you
know
that
i
do
how
can
you
ask
such
questions
but
you
do
love
me
len
do
you
of
course
i
do
a
pause
the
other
remark
was
still
due
len
well
what
is
it
len
you
will
make
it
all
right
i
ca
have
you
ask
me
that
again
said
the
boy
flaring
up
into
a
sudden
passion
i
promised
to
marry
you
when
i
of
age
and
that
enough
my
word
my
word
i
promised
to
marry
you
as
soon
as
ever
i
and
i
ca
keep
on
being
worried
i
worries
enough
it
is
likely
i
throw
you
over
let
alone
my
word
when
i
spent
all
this
money
besides
i
an
englishman
and
i
never
go
back
on
my
word
jacky
do
be
reasonable
of
course
i
marry
you
only
do
stop
badgering
me
when
your
birthday
len
i
told
you
again
and
again
the
eleventh
of
november
next
now
get
off
my
knee
a
bit
someone
must
get
supper
i
suppose
jacky
went
through
to
the
bedroom
and
began
to
see
to
her
hat
this
meant
blowing
at
it
with
short
sharp
puffs
leonard
tidied
up
the
and
began
to
prepare
their
evening
meal
he
put
a
penny
into
the
slot
of
the
and
soon
the
flat
was
reeking
with
metallic
fumes
somehow
he
could
not
recover
his
temper
and
all
the
time
he
was
cooking
he
continued
to
complain
bitterly
it
really
is
too
bad
when
a
fellow
is
trusted
it
makes
one
feel
so
wild
when
i
pretended
to
the
people
here
that
you
my
wife
all
right
you
shall
be
my
wife
and
i
bought
you
the
ring
to
wear
and
i
taken
this
flat
furnished
and
it
far
more
than
i
can
afford
and
yet
you
are
content
and
i
also
not
told
the
truth
when
i
written
home
he
lowered
his
voice
he
stop
it
in
a
tone
of
horror
that
was
a
little
luxurious
he
repeated
my
brother
stop
it
i
going
against
the
whole
world
jacky
that
what
i
am
jacky
i
do
take
any
heed
of
what
anyone
says
i
just
go
straight
forward
i
do
always
been
my
way
i
not
one
of
your
weak
chaps
if
a
woman
in
trouble
i
do
leave
her
in
the
lurch
that
not
my
street
no
thank
you
i
tell
you
another
thing
too
i
care
a
good
deal
about
improving
myself
by
means
of
literature
and
art
and
so
getting
a
wider
outlook
for
instance
when
you
came
in
i
was
reading
ruskin
stones
of
venice
i
do
say
this
to
boast
but
just
to
show
you
the
kind
of
man
i
am
i
can
tell
you
i
enjoyed
that
classical
concert
this
afternoon
to
all
his
moods
jacky
remained
equally
indifferent
when
supper
was
ready
and
not
before
she
emerged
from
the
bedroom
saying
but
you
do
love
me
do
you
they
began
with
a
soup
square
which
leonard
had
just
dissolved
in
some
hot
water
it
was
followed
by
the
tongue
a
freckled
cylinder
of
meat
with
a
little
jelly
at
the
top
and
a
great
deal
of
yellow
fat
at
the
bottom
ending
with
another
square
dissolved
in
water
jelly
pineapple
which
leonard
had
prepared
earlier
in
the
day
jacky
ate
contentedly
enough
occasionally
looking
at
her
man
with
those
anxious
eyes
to
which
nothing
else
in
her
appearance
corresponded
and
which
yet
seemed
to
mirror
her
soul
and
leonard
managed
to
convince
his
stomach
that
it
was
having
a
nourishing
meal
after
supper
they
smoked
cigarettes
and
exchanged
a
few
statements
she
observed
that
her
likeness
had
been
broken
he
found
occasion
to
remark
for
the
second
time
that
he
had
come
straight
back
home
after
the
concert
at
queen
hall
presently
she
sat
upon
his
knee
the
inhabitants
of
camelia
road
tramped
to
and
fro
outside
the
window
just
on
a
level
with
their
heads
and
the
family
in
the
flat
on
the
began
to
sing
hark
my
soul
it
is
the
lord
that
tune
fairly
gives
me
the
hump
said
leonard
jacky
followed
this
and
said
that
for
her
part
she
thought
it
a
lovely
tune
no
i
play
you
something
lovely
get
up
dear
for
a
minute
he
went
to
the
piano
and
jingled
out
a
little
grieg
he
played
badly
and
vulgarly
but
the
performance
was
not
without
its
effect
for
jacky
said
she
thought
she
be
going
to
bed
as
she
receded
a
new
set
of
interests
possessed
the
boy
and
he
began
to
think
of
what
had
been
said
about
music
by
that
odd
miss
schlegel
the
one
that
twisted
her
face
about
so
when
she
spoke
then
the
thoughts
grew
sad
and
envious
there
was
the
girl
named
helen
who
had
pinched
his
umbrella
and
the
german
girl
who
had
smiled
at
him
pleasantly
and
herr
someone
and
aunt
someone
and
the
brother
all
all
with
their
hands
on
the
ropes
they
had
all
passed
up
that
narrow
rich
staircase
at
wickham
place
to
some
ample
room
whither
he
could
never
follow
them
not
if
he
read
for
ten
hours
a
day
oh
it
was
not
good
this
continual
aspiration
some
are
born
cultured
the
rest
had
better
go
in
for
whatever
comes
easy
to
see
life
steadily
and
to
see
it
whole
was
not
for
the
likes
of
him
from
the
darkness
beyond
the
kitchen
a
voice
called
len
you
in
bed
he
asked
his
forehead
twitching
m
all
right
presently
she
called
him
again
i
must
clean
my
boots
ready
for
the
morning
he
answered
presently
she
called
him
again
i
rather
want
to
get
this
chapter
done
what
he
closed
his
ears
against
her
what
that
all
right
jacky
nothing
i
reading
a
book
what
what
he
answered
catching
her
degraded
deafness
presently
she
called
him
again
ruskin
had
visited
torcello
by
this
time
and
was
ordering
his
gondoliers
to
take
him
to
murano
it
occurred
to
him
as
he
glided
over
the
whispering
lagoons
that
the
power
of
nature
could
not
be
shortened
by
the
folly
nor
her
beauty
altogether
saddened
by
the
misery
of
such
as
leonard
chapter
oh
margaret
cried
her
aunt
next
morning
such
a
most
unfortunate
thing
has
happened
i
could
not
get
you
alone
the
most
unfortunate
thing
was
not
very
serious
one
of
the
flats
in
the
ornate
block
opposite
had
been
taken
furnished
by
the
wilcox
family
coming
up
no
doubt
in
the
hope
of
getting
into
london
society
that
munt
should
be
the
first
to
discover
the
misfortune
was
not
remarkable
for
she
was
so
interested
in
the
flats
that
she
watched
their
every
mutation
with
unwearying
care
in
theory
she
despised
them
they
took
away
that
look
they
cut
off
the
sun
flats
house
a
flashy
type
of
person
but
if
the
truth
had
been
known
she
found
her
visits
to
wickham
place
twice
as
amusing
since
wickham
mansions
had
arisen
and
would
in
a
couple
of
days
learn
more
about
them
than
her
nieces
in
a
couple
of
months
or
her
nephew
in
a
couple
of
years
she
would
stroll
across
and
make
friends
with
the
porters
and
inquire
what
the
rents
were
exclaiming
for
example
what
a
hundred
and
twenty
for
a
basement
you
never
get
it
and
they
would
answer
one
can
but
try
madam
the
passenger
lifts
the
provision
lifts
the
arrangement
for
coals
a
great
temptation
for
a
dishonest
porter
were
all
familiar
matters
to
her
and
perhaps
a
relief
from
the
atmosphere
that
reigned
at
the
schlegels
margaret
received
the
information
calmly
and
did
not
agree
that
it
would
throw
a
cloud
over
poor
helen
life
oh
but
helen
is
a
girl
with
no
interests
she
explained
she
has
plenty
of
other
things
and
other
people
to
think
about
she
made
a
false
start
with
the
wilcoxes
and
she
be
as
willing
as
we
are
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
them
for
a
clever
girl
dear
how
very
oddly
you
do
talk
helen
have
to
have
something
more
to
do
with
them
now
that
they
all
opposite
she
may
meet
that
paul
in
the
street
she
can
not
very
well
not
bow
of
course
she
must
bow
but
look
here
let
do
the
flowers
i
was
going
to
say
the
will
to
be
interested
in
him
has
died
and
what
else
matters
i
look
on
that
disastrous
episode
over
which
you
were
so
kind
as
the
killing
of
a
nerve
in
helen
it
dead
and
she
never
be
troubled
with
it
again
the
only
things
that
matter
are
the
things
that
interest
one
bowing
even
calling
and
leaving
cards
even
a
we
can
do
all
those
things
to
the
wilcoxes
if
they
find
it
agreeable
but
the
other
thing
the
one
important
thing
never
again
do
you
see
munt
did
not
see
and
indeed
margaret
was
making
a
most
questionable
statement
that
any
emotion
any
interest
once
vividly
aroused
can
wholly
die
i
also
have
the
honour
to
inform
you
that
the
wilcoxes
are
bored
with
us
i
did
tell
you
at
the
time
it
might
have
made
you
angry
and
you
had
enough
to
worry
you
but
i
wrote
a
letter
to
and
apologized
for
the
trouble
that
helen
had
given
them
she
did
answer
it
how
very
rude
i
wonder
or
was
it
sensible
no
margaret
most
rude
in
either
case
one
can
class
it
as
reassuring
munt
sighed
she
was
going
back
to
swanage
on
the
morrow
just
as
her
nieces
were
wanting
her
most
other
regrets
crowded
upon
her
for
instance
how
magnificently
she
would
have
cut
charles
if
she
had
met
him
face
to
face
she
had
already
seen
him
giving
an
order
to
the
porter
and
very
common
he
looked
in
a
tall
hat
but
unfortunately
his
back
was
turned
to
her
and
though
she
had
cut
his
back
she
could
not
regard
this
as
a
telling
snub
but
you
will
be
careful
wo
you
she
exhorted
oh
certainly
fiendishly
careful
and
helen
must
be
careful
too
careful
over
what
cried
helen
at
that
moment
coming
into
the
room
with
her
cousin
nothing
said
margaret
seized
with
a
momentary
awkwardness
careful
over
what
aunt
juley
munt
assumed
a
cryptic
air
it
is
only
that
a
certain
family
whom
we
know
by
name
but
do
not
mention
as
you
said
yourself
last
night
after
the
concert
have
taken
the
flat
opposite
from
the
mathesons
where
the
plants
are
in
the
balcony
helen
began
some
laughing
reply
and
then
disconcerted
them
all
by
blushing
munt
was
so
disconcerted
that
she
exclaimed
what
helen
you
do
mind
them
coming
do
you
and
deepened
the
blush
to
crimson
of
course
i
do
mind
said
helen
a
little
crossly
it
is
that
you
and
meg
are
both
so
absurdly
grave
about
it
when
there
nothing
to
be
grave
about
at
all
i
not
grave
protested
margaret
a
little
cross
in
her
turn
well
you
look
grave
does
she
frieda
i
do
feel
grave
that
all
i
can
say
you
going
quite
on
the
wrong
tack
no
she
does
not
feel
grave
echoed
munt
i
can
bear
witness
to
that
she
disagrees
hark
interrupted
fraulein
mosebach
i
hear
bruno
entering
the
hall
for
herr
liesecke
was
due
at
wickham
place
to
call
for
the
two
younger
girls
he
was
not
entering
the
hall
in
fact
he
did
not
enter
it
for
quite
five
minutes
but
frieda
detected
a
delicate
situation
and
said
that
she
and
helen
had
much
better
wait
for
bruno
down
below
and
leave
margaret
and
munt
to
finish
arranging
the
flowers
helen
acquiesced
but
as
if
to
prove
that
the
situation
was
not
delicate
really
she
stopped
in
the
doorway
and
said
did
you
say
the
mathesons
flat
aunt
juley
how
wonderful
you
are
i
never
knew
that
the
woman
who
laced
too
tightly
name
was
matheson
come
helen
said
her
cousin
go
helen
said
her
aunt
and
continued
to
margaret
almost
in
the
same
breath
helen
can
not
deceive
me
she
does
mind
oh
hush
breathed
margaret
frieda
hear
you
and
she
can
be
so
tiresome
she
minds
persisted
munt
moving
thoughtfully
about
the
room
and
pulling
the
dead
chrysanthemums
out
of
the
vases
i
knew
she
mind
and
i
sure
a
girl
ought
to
such
an
experience
such
awful
people
i
know
more
about
them
than
you
do
which
you
forget
and
if
charles
had
taken
you
that
motor
drive
well
you
have
reached
the
house
a
perfect
wreck
oh
margaret
you
know
what
you
are
in
for
they
all
bottled
up
against
the
window
there
wilcox
i
seen
her
there
paul
there
evie
who
is
a
minx
charles
i
saw
him
to
start
with
and
who
would
an
elderly
man
with
a
moustache
and
a
face
be
wilcox
possibly
i
knew
it
and
there
mr
wilcox
it
a
shame
to
call
his
face
copper
colour
complained
margaret
he
has
a
remarkably
good
complexion
for
a
man
of
his
age
munt
triumphant
elsewhere
could
afford
to
concede
wilcox
his
complexion
she
passed
on
from
it
to
the
plan
of
campaign
that
her
nieces
should
pursue
in
the
future
margaret
tried
to
stop
her
helen
did
not
take
the
news
quite
as
i
expected
but
the
wilcox
nerve
is
dead
in
her
really
so
there
no
need
for
plans
it
as
well
to
be
prepared
no
it
as
well
not
to
be
prepared
because
her
thought
drew
being
from
the
obscure
borderland
she
could
not
explain
in
so
many
words
but
she
felt
that
those
who
prepare
for
all
the
emergencies
of
life
beforehand
may
equip
themselves
at
the
expense
of
joy
it
is
necessary
to
prepare
for
an
examination
or
a
or
a
possible
fall
in
the
price
of
stock
those
who
attempt
human
relations
must
adopt
another
method
or
fail
because
sooner
risk
it
was
her
lame
conclusion
but
imagine
the
evenings
exclaimed
her
aunt
pointing
to
the
mansions
with
the
spout
of
the
turn
the
electric
light
on
here
or
there
and
it
almost
the
same
room
one
evening
they
may
forget
to
draw
their
blinds
down
and
you
see
them
and
the
next
you
yours
and
they
see
you
impossible
to
sit
out
on
the
balconies
impossible
to
water
the
plants
or
even
speak
imagine
going
out
of
the
and
they
come
out
opposite
at
the
same
moment
and
yet
you
tell
me
that
plans
are
unnecessary
and
you
rather
risk
it
i
hope
to
risk
things
all
my
life
oh
margaret
most
dangerous
but
after
all
she
continued
with
a
smile
never
any
great
risk
as
long
as
you
have
money
oh
shame
what
a
shocking
speech
money
pads
the
edges
of
things
said
miss
schlegel
god
help
those
who
have
none
but
this
is
something
quite
new
said
munt
who
collected
new
ideas
as
a
squirrel
collects
nuts
and
was
especially
attracted
by
those
that
are
portable
new
for
me
sensible
people
have
acknowledged
it
for
years
you
and
i
and
the
wilcoxes
stand
upon
money
as
upon
islands
it
is
so
firm
beneath
our
feet
that
we
forget
its
very
existence
it
only
when
we
see
someone
near
us
tottering
that
we
realize
all
that
an
independent
income
means
last
night
when
we
were
talking
up
here
round
the
fire
i
began
to
think
that
the
very
soul
of
the
world
is
economic
and
that
the
lowest
abyss
is
not
the
absence
of
love
but
the
absence
of
coin
i
call
that
rather
cynical
so
do
i
but
helen
and
i
we
ought
to
remember
when
we
are
tempted
to
criticize
others
that
we
are
standing
on
these
islands
and
that
most
of
the
others
are
down
below
the
surface
of
the
sea
the
poor
can
not
always
reach
those
whom
they
want
to
love
and
they
can
hardly
ever
escape
from
those
whom
they
love
no
longer
we
rich
can
imagine
the
tragedy
last
june
if
helen
and
paul
wilcox
had
been
poor
people
and
could
invoke
railways
and
to
part
them
that
more
like
socialism
said
munt
suspiciously
call
it
what
you
like
i
call
it
going
through
life
with
one
hand
spread
open
on
the
table
i
tired
of
these
rich
people
who
pretend
to
be
poor
and
think
it
shows
a
nice
mind
to
ignore
the
piles
of
money
that
keep
their
feet
above
the
waves
i
stand
each
year
upon
six
hundred
pounds
and
helen
upon
the
same
and
tibby
will
stand
upon
eight
and
as
fast
as
our
pounds
crumble
away
into
the
sea
they
are
renewed
from
the
sea
yes
from
the
sea
and
all
our
thoughts
are
the
thoughts
of
and
all
our
speeches
and
because
we
do
want
to
steal
umbrellas
ourselves
we
forget
that
below
the
sea
people
do
want
to
steal
them
and
do
steal
them
sometimes
and
that
what
a
joke
up
here
is
down
there
reality
there
they
go
there
goes
fraulein
mosebach
really
for
a
german
she
does
dress
charmingly
oh
what
is
it
helen
was
looking
up
at
the
wilcoxes
flat
why
should
she
i
beg
your
pardon
i
interrupted
you
what
was
it
you
were
saying
about
reality
i
had
worked
round
to
myself
as
usual
answered
margaret
in
tones
that
were
suddenly
preoccupied
do
tell
me
this
at
all
events
are
you
for
the
rich
or
for
the
poor
too
difficult
ask
me
another
am
i
for
poverty
or
for
riches
for
riches
hurrah
for
riches
for
riches
echoed
munt
having
as
it
were
at
last
secured
her
nut
yes
for
riches
money
for
ever
so
am
i
and
so
i
am
afraid
are
most
of
my
acquaintances
at
swanage
but
i
am
surprised
that
you
agree
with
us
thank
you
so
much
aunt
juley
while
i
have
talked
theories
you
have
done
the
flowers
not
at
all
dear
i
wish
you
would
let
me
help
you
in
more
important
things
well
would
you
be
very
kind
would
you
come
round
with
me
to
the
registry
office
there
a
housemaid
who
wo
say
yes
but
does
say
no
on
their
way
thither
they
too
looked
up
at
the
flat
evie
was
in
the
balcony
staring
most
rudely
according
to
munt
oh
yes
it
was
a
nuisance
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
helen
was
proof
against
a
passing
encounter
but
margaret
began
to
lose
confidence
might
it
reawake
the
dying
nerve
if
the
family
were
living
close
against
her
eyes
and
frieda
mosebach
was
stopping
with
them
for
another
fortnight
and
frieda
was
sharp
abominably
sharp
and
quite
capable
of
remarking
you
love
one
of
the
young
gentlemen
opposite
yes
the
remark
would
be
untrue
but
of
the
kind
which
if
stated
often
enough
may
become
true
just
as
the
remark
england
and
germany
are
bound
to
fight
renders
war
a
little
more
likely
each
time
that
it
is
made
and
is
therefore
made
the
more
readily
by
the
gutter
press
of
either
nation
have
the
private
emotions
also
their
gutter
press
margaret
thought
so
and
feared
that
good
aunt
juley
and
frieda
were
typical
specimens
of
it
they
might
by
continual
chatter
lead
helen
into
a
repetition
of
the
desires
of
june
into
a
repetition
they
could
not
do
more
they
could
not
lead
her
into
lasting
love
they
were
she
saw
it
clearly
journalism
her
father
with
all
his
defects
and
had
been
literature
and
had
he
lived
he
would
have
persuaded
his
daughter
rightly
the
registry
office
was
holding
its
morning
reception
a
string
of
carriages
filled
the
street
miss
schlegel
waited
her
turn
and
finally
had
to
be
content
with
an
insidious
temporary
being
rejected
by
genuine
housemaids
on
the
ground
of
her
numerous
stairs
her
failure
depressed
her
and
though
she
forgot
the
failure
the
depression
remained
on
her
way
home
she
again
glanced
up
at
the
wilcoxes
flat
and
took
the
rather
matronly
step
of
speaking
about
the
matter
to
helen
helen
you
must
tell
me
whether
this
thing
worries
you
if
what
said
helen
who
was
washing
her
hands
for
lunch
the
coming
no
of
course
not
really
really
then
she
admitted
that
she
was
a
little
worried
on
wilcox
account
she
implied
that
wilcox
might
reach
backward
into
deep
feelings
and
be
pained
by
things
that
never
touched
the
other
members
of
that
clan
i
sha
mind
if
paul
points
at
our
house
and
says
lives
the
girl
who
tried
to
catch
me
but
she
might
if
even
that
worries
you
we
could
arrange
something
there
no
reason
we
should
be
near
people
who
displease
us
or
whom
we
displease
thanks
to
our
money
we
might
even
go
away
for
a
little
well
i
am
going
away
frieda
just
asked
me
to
stettin
and
i
sha
be
back
till
after
the
new
year
will
that
do
or
must
i
fly
the
country
altogether
really
meg
what
has
come
over
you
to
make
such
a
fuss
oh
i
getting
an
old
maid
i
suppose
i
thought
i
minded
nothing
but
really
i
i
should
be
bored
if
you
fell
in
love
with
the
same
man
twice
and
she
cleared
her
throat
you
did
go
red
you
know
when
aunt
juley
attacked
you
this
morning
i
should
have
referred
to
it
otherwise
but
helen
laugh
rang
true
as
she
raised
a
soapy
hand
to
heaven
and
swore
that
never
nowhere
and
nohow
would
she
again
fall
in
love
with
any
of
the
wilcox
family
down
to
its
remotest
collaterals
chapter
the
friendship
between
margaret
and
wilcox
which
was
to
develop
so
quickly
and
with
such
strange
results
may
perhaps
have
had
its
beginnings
at
speyer
in
the
spring
perhaps
the
elder
lady
as
she
gazed
at
the
vulgar
ruddy
cathedral
and
listened
to
the
talk
of
helen
and
her
husband
may
have
detected
in
the
other
and
less
charming
of
the
sisters
a
deeper
sympathy
a
sounder
judgment
she
was
capable
of
detecting
such
things
perhaps
it
was
she
who
had
desired
the
miss
schlegels
to
be
invited
to
howards
end
and
margaret
whose
presence
she
had
particularly
desired
all
this
is
speculation
wilcox
has
left
few
clear
indications
behind
her
it
is
certain
that
she
came
to
call
at
wickham
place
a
fortnight
later
the
very
day
that
helen
was
going
with
her
cousin
to
stettin
helen
cried
fraulein
mosebach
in
awestruck
tones
she
was
now
in
her
cousin
confidence
his
mother
has
forgiven
you
and
then
remembering
that
in
england
the
ought
not
to
call
before
she
is
called
upon
she
changed
her
tone
from
awe
to
disapproval
and
opined
that
wilcox
was
keine
dame
bother
the
whole
family
snapped
margaret
helen
stop
giggling
and
pirouetting
and
go
and
finish
your
packing
why
ca
the
woman
leave
us
alone
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
with
meg
helen
retorted
collapsing
upon
the
stairs
she
got
wilcox
and
box
upon
the
brain
meg
meg
i
do
love
the
young
gentleman
i
do
love
the
young
gentleman
meg
meg
can
a
body
speak
plainer
most
certainly
her
love
has
died
asserted
fraulein
mosebach
most
certainly
it
has
frieda
but
that
will
not
prevent
me
from
being
bored
with
the
wilcoxes
if
i
return
the
call
then
helen
simulated
tears
and
fraulein
mosebach
who
thought
her
extremely
amusing
did
the
same
oh
boo
hoo
boo
hoo
hoo
meg
going
to
return
the
call
and
i
ca
why
i
going
to
if
you
are
going
to
germany
go
and
pack
if
you
are
go
and
call
on
the
wilcoxes
instead
of
me
but
meg
meg
i
do
love
the
young
gentleman
i
do
love
the
young
lud
who
that
coming
down
the
stairs
i
vow
is
my
brother
crimini
a
male
even
such
a
male
as
tibby
was
enough
to
stop
the
foolery
the
barrier
of
sex
though
decreasing
among
the
civilized
is
still
high
and
higher
on
the
side
of
women
helen
could
tell
her
sister
all
and
her
cousin
much
about
paul
she
told
her
brother
nothing
it
was
not
prudishness
for
she
now
spoke
of
the
wilcox
ideal
with
laughter
and
even
with
a
growing
brutality
nor
was
it
precaution
for
tibby
seldom
repeated
any
news
that
did
not
concern
himself
it
was
rather
the
feeling
that
she
betrayed
a
secret
into
the
camp
of
men
and
that
however
trivial
it
was
on
this
side
of
the
barrier
it
would
become
important
on
that
so
she
stopped
or
rather
began
to
fool
on
other
subjects
until
her
relatives
drove
her
upstairs
fraulein
mosebach
followed
her
but
lingered
to
say
heavily
over
the
banisters
to
margaret
it
is
all
right
she
does
not
love
the
young
man
he
has
not
been
worthy
of
her
yes
i
know
thanks
very
much
i
thought
i
did
right
to
tell
you
ever
so
many
thanks
what
that
asked
tibby
no
one
told
him
and
he
proceeded
into
the
to
eat
elvas
plums
that
evening
margaret
took
decisive
action
the
house
was
very
quiet
and
the
fog
we
are
in
november
now
pressed
against
the
windows
like
an
excluded
ghost
frieda
and
helen
and
all
their
luggage
had
gone
tibby
who
was
not
feeling
well
lay
stretched
on
a
sofa
by
the
fire
margaret
sat
by
him
thinking
her
mind
darted
from
impulse
to
impulse
and
finally
marshalled
them
all
in
review
the
practical
person
who
knows
what
he
wants
at
once
and
generally
knows
nothing
else
will
excuse
her
of
indecision
but
this
was
the
way
her
mind
worked
and
when
she
did
act
no
one
could
accuse
her
of
indecision
then
she
hit
out
as
lustily
as
if
she
had
not
considered
the
matter
at
all
the
letter
that
she
wrote
wilcox
glowed
with
the
native
hue
of
resolution
the
pale
cast
of
thought
was
with
her
a
breath
rather
than
a
tarnish
a
breath
that
leaves
the
colours
all
the
more
vivid
when
it
has
been
wiped
away
dear
wilcox
i
have
to
write
something
discourteous
it
would
be
better
if
we
did
not
meet
both
my
sister
and
my
aunt
have
given
displeasure
to
your
family
and
in
my
sister
case
the
grounds
for
displeasure
might
recur
as
far
as
i
know
she
no
longer
occupies
her
thoughts
with
your
son
but
it
would
not
be
fair
either
to
her
or
to
you
if
they
met
and
it
is
therefore
right
that
our
acquaintance
which
began
so
pleasantly
should
end
i
fear
that
you
will
not
agree
with
this
indeed
i
know
that
you
will
not
since
you
have
been
good
enough
to
call
on
us
it
is
only
an
instinct
on
my
part
and
no
doubt
the
instinct
is
wrong
my
sister
would
undoubtedly
say
that
it
is
wrong
i
write
without
her
knowledge
and
i
hope
that
you
will
not
associate
her
with
my
discourtesy
believe
me
yours
truly
schlegel
margaret
sent
this
letter
round
by
post
next
morning
she
received
the
following
reply
by
hand
dear
miss
schlegel
you
should
not
have
written
me
such
a
letter
i
called
to
tell
you
that
paul
has
gone
abroad
ruth
wilcox
margaret
cheeks
burnt
she
could
not
finish
her
breakfast
she
was
on
fire
with
shame
helen
had
told
her
that
the
youth
was
leaving
england
but
other
things
had
seemed
more
important
and
she
had
forgotten
all
her
absurd
anxieties
fell
to
the
ground
and
in
their
place
arose
the
certainty
that
she
had
been
rude
to
wilcox
rudeness
affected
margaret
like
a
bitter
taste
in
the
mouth
it
poisoned
life
at
times
it
is
necessary
but
woe
to
those
who
employ
it
without
due
need
she
flung
on
a
hat
and
shawl
just
like
a
poor
woman
and
plunged
into
the
fog
which
still
continued
her
lips
were
compressed
the
letter
remained
in
her
hand
and
in
this
state
she
crossed
the
street
entered
the
marble
vestibule
of
the
flats
eluded
the
concierges
and
ran
up
the
stairs
till
she
reached
the
she
sent
in
her
name
and
to
her
surprise
was
shown
straight
into
wilcox
bedroom
oh
wilcox
i
have
made
the
baddest
blunder
i
am
more
more
ashamed
and
sorry
than
i
can
say
wilcox
bowed
gravely
she
was
offended
and
did
not
pretend
to
the
contrary
she
was
sitting
up
in
bed
writing
letters
on
an
invalid
table
that
spanned
her
knees
a
breakfast
tray
was
on
another
table
beside
her
the
light
of
the
fire
the
light
from
the
window
and
the
light
of
a
which
threw
a
quivering
halo
round
her
hands
combined
to
create
a
strange
atmosphere
of
dissolution
i
knew
he
was
going
to
india
in
november
but
i
forgot
he
sailed
on
the
for
nigeria
in
africa
i
knew
i
know
i
have
been
too
absurd
all
through
i
am
very
much
ashamed
wilcox
did
not
answer
i
am
more
sorry
than
i
can
say
and
i
hope
that
you
will
forgive
me
it
does
matter
miss
schlegel
it
is
good
of
you
to
have
come
round
so
promptly
it
does
matter
cried
margaret
i
have
been
rude
to
you
and
my
sister
is
not
even
at
home
so
there
was
not
even
that
excuse
indeed
she
has
just
gone
to
germany
she
gone
as
well
murmured
the
other
yes
certainly
it
is
quite
safe
safe
absolutely
now
you
been
worrying
too
exclaimed
margaret
getting
more
and
more
excited
and
taking
a
chair
without
invitation
how
perfectly
extraordinary
i
can
see
that
you
have
you
felt
as
i
do
helen
must
meet
him
again
i
did
think
it
best
now
why
that
a
most
difficult
question
said
wilcox
smiling
and
a
little
losing
her
expression
of
annoyance
i
think
you
put
it
best
in
your
letter
it
was
an
instinct
which
may
be
wrong
it
was
that
your
son
still
oh
no
he
often
my
paul
is
very
young
you
see
then
what
was
it
she
repeated
an
instinct
which
may
be
wrong
in
other
words
they
belong
to
types
that
can
fall
in
love
but
could
live
together
that
dreadfully
probable
i
afraid
that
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
nature
pulls
one
way
and
human
nature
another
these
are
indeed
words
said
mrs
wilcox
i
had
nothing
so
coherent
in
my
head
i
was
merely
alarmed
when
i
knew
that
my
boy
cared
for
your
sister
ah
i
have
always
been
wanting
to
ask
you
how
did
you
know
helen
was
so
surprised
when
our
aunt
drove
up
and
you
stepped
forward
and
arranged
things
did
paul
tell
you
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
discussing
that
said
wilcox
after
a
moment
pause
wilcox
were
you
very
angry
with
us
last
june
i
wrote
you
a
letter
and
you
did
answer
it
i
was
certainly
against
taking
matheson
flat
i
knew
it
was
opposite
your
house
but
it
all
right
now
i
think
so
you
only
think
you
are
sure
i
do
love
these
little
muddles
tidied
up
oh
yes
i
sure
said
wilcox
moving
with
uneasiness
beneath
the
clothes
i
always
sound
uncertain
over
things
it
is
my
way
of
speaking
that
all
right
and
i
sure
too
here
the
maid
came
in
to
remove
the
they
were
interrupted
and
when
they
resumed
conversation
it
was
on
more
normal
lines
i
must
say
now
you
will
be
getting
up
no
please
stop
a
little
longer
i
am
taking
a
day
in
bed
now
and
then
i
do
i
thought
of
you
as
one
of
the
early
risers
at
howards
end
yes
there
is
nothing
to
get
up
for
in
london
nothing
to
get
up
for
cried
the
scandalized
margaret
when
there
are
all
the
autumn
exhibitions
and
ysaye
playing
in
the
afternoon
not
to
mention
people
the
truth
is
i
am
a
little
tired
first
came
the
wedding
and
then
paul
went
off
and
instead
of
resting
yesterday
i
paid
a
round
of
calls
a
wedding
yes
charles
my
elder
son
is
married
indeed
we
took
the
flat
chiefly
on
that
account
and
also
that
paul
could
get
his
african
outfit
the
flat
belongs
to
a
cousin
of
my
husband
and
she
most
kindly
offered
it
to
us
so
before
the
day
came
we
were
able
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
dolly
people
which
we
had
not
yet
done
margaret
asked
who
dolly
people
were
fussell
the
father
is
in
the
indian
army
retired
the
brother
is
in
the
army
the
mother
is
dead
so
perhaps
these
were
the
chinless
sunburnt
men
whom
helen
had
espied
one
afternoon
through
the
window
margaret
felt
mildly
interested
in
the
fortunes
of
the
wilcox
family
she
had
acquired
the
habit
on
helen
account
and
it
still
clung
to
her
she
asked
for
more
information
about
miss
dolly
fussell
that
was
and
was
given
it
in
even
unemotional
tones
wilcox
voice
though
sweet
and
compelling
had
little
range
of
expression
it
suggested
that
pictures
concerts
and
people
are
all
of
small
and
equal
value
only
once
had
it
quickened
when
speaking
of
howards
end
charles
and
albert
fussell
have
known
one
another
some
time
they
belong
to
the
same
club
and
are
both
devoted
to
golf
dolly
plays
golf
too
though
i
believe
not
so
well
and
they
first
met
in
a
mixed
foursome
we
all
like
her
and
are
very
much
pleased
they
were
married
on
the
a
few
days
before
paul
sailed
charles
was
very
anxious
to
have
his
brother
as
best
man
so
he
made
a
great
point
of
having
it
on
the
the
fussells
would
have
preferred
it
after
christmas
but
they
were
very
nice
about
it
there
is
dolly
photograph
in
that
double
frame
are
you
quite
certain
that
i
not
interrupting
mrs
wilcox
yes
quite
then
i
will
stay
i
enjoying
this
dolly
photograph
was
now
examined
it
was
signed
for
dear
mims
which
wilcox
interpreted
as
the
name
she
and
charles
had
settled
that
she
should
call
me
dolly
looked
silly
and
had
one
of
those
triangular
faces
that
so
often
prove
attractive
to
a
robust
man
she
was
very
pretty
from
her
margaret
passed
to
charles
whose
features
prevailed
opposite
she
speculated
on
the
forces
that
had
drawn
the
two
together
till
god
parted
them
she
found
time
to
hope
that
they
would
be
happy
they
have
gone
to
naples
for
their
honeymoon
lucky
people
i
can
hardly
imagine
charles
in
italy
does
he
care
for
travelling
he
likes
travel
but
he
does
see
through
foreigners
so
what
he
enjoys
most
is
a
motor
tour
in
england
and
i
think
that
would
have
carried
the
day
if
the
weather
had
not
been
so
abominable
his
father
gave
him
a
car
of
his
own
for
a
wedding
present
which
for
the
present
is
being
stored
at
howards
end
i
suppose
you
have
a
garage
there
yes
my
husband
built
a
little
one
only
last
month
to
the
west
of
the
house
not
far
from
the
in
what
used
to
be
the
paddock
for
the
pony
the
last
words
had
an
indescribable
ring
about
them
where
the
pony
gone
asked
margaret
after
a
pause
the
pony
oh
dead
ever
so
long
ago
the
i
remember
helen
spoke
of
it
as
a
very
splendid
tree
it
is
the
finest
in
hertfordshire
did
your
sister
tell
you
about
the
teeth
no
oh
it
might
interest
you
there
are
pigs
teeth
stuck
into
the
trunk
about
four
feet
from
the
ground
the
country
people
put
them
in
long
ago
and
they
think
that
if
they
chew
a
piece
of
the
bark
it
will
cure
the
toothache
the
teeth
are
almost
grown
over
now
and
no
one
comes
to
the
tree
i
should
i
love
folklore
and
all
festering
superstitions
do
you
think
that
the
tree
really
did
cure
toothache
if
one
believed
in
it
of
course
it
did
it
would
cure
anything
once
certainly
i
remember
cases
you
see
i
lived
at
howards
end
long
long
before
wilcox
knew
it
i
was
born
there
the
conversation
again
shifted
at
the
time
it
seemed
little
more
than
aimless
chatter
she
was
interested
when
her
hostess
explained
that
howards
end
was
her
own
property
she
was
bored
when
too
minute
an
account
was
given
of
the
fussell
family
of
the
anxieties
of
charles
concerning
naples
of
the
movements
of
wilcox
and
evie
who
were
motoring
in
yorkshire
margaret
could
not
bear
being
bored
she
grew
inattentive
played
with
the
photograph
frame
dropped
it
smashed
dolly
glass
apologized
was
pardoned
cut
her
finger
thereon
was
pitied
and
finally
said
she
must
be
going
there
was
all
the
housekeeping
to
do
and
she
had
to
interview
then
the
curious
note
was
struck
again
miss
schlegel
thank
you
for
coming
you
have
cheered
me
up
i
so
glad
i
i
wonder
whether
you
ever
think
about
i
think
of
nothing
else
said
margaret
blushing
but
letting
her
hand
remain
in
that
of
the
invalid
i
wonder
i
wondered
at
heidelberg
i
sure
i
almost
think
yes
asked
margaret
for
there
was
a
long
pause
a
pause
that
was
somehow
akin
to
the
flicker
of
the
fire
the
quiver
of
the
upon
their
hands
the
white
blur
from
the
window
a
pause
of
shifting
and
eternal
shadows
i
almost
think
you
forget
you
a
girl
margaret
was
startled
and
a
little
annoyed
she
remarked
that
not
so
wildly
girlish
wilcox
smiled
what
makes
you
say
that
do
you
mean
that
i
have
been
gauche
and
rude
a
shake
of
the
head
i
only
meant
that
i
am
and
that
to
me
both
of
you
read
it
all
in
some
book
or
other
i
can
not
put
things
clearly
oh
i
got
it
inexperience
i
no
better
than
helen
you
mean
and
yet
i
presume
to
advise
her
yes
you
have
got
it
inexperience
is
the
word
inexperience
repeated
margaret
in
serious
yet
buoyant
tones
of
course
i
have
everything
to
learn
absolutely
everything
just
as
much
as
helen
very
difficult
and
full
of
surprises
at
all
events
got
as
far
as
that
to
be
humble
and
kind
to
go
straight
ahead
to
love
people
rather
than
pity
them
to
remember
the
submerged
well
one
ca
do
all
these
things
at
once
worse
luck
because
they
so
contradictory
it
then
that
proportion
comes
in
to
live
by
proportion
begin
with
proportion
only
prigs
do
that
let
proportion
come
in
as
a
last
resource
when
the
better
things
have
failed
and
a
deadlock
gracious
me
i
started
preaching
indeed
you
put
the
difficulties
of
life
splendidly
said
wilcox
withdrawing
her
hand
into
the
deeper
shadows
it
is
just
what
i
should
have
liked
to
say
about
them
myself
chapter
wilcox
can
not
be
accused
of
giving
margaret
much
information
about
life
and
margaret
on
the
other
hand
has
made
a
fair
show
of
modesty
and
has
pretended
to
an
inexperience
that
she
certainly
did
not
feel
she
had
kept
house
for
over
ten
years
she
had
entertained
almost
with
distinction
she
had
brought
up
a
charming
sister
and
was
bringing
up
a
brother
surely
if
experience
is
attainable
she
had
attained
it
yet
the
little
that
she
gave
in
wilcox
honour
was
not
a
success
the
new
friend
did
not
blend
with
the
one
or
two
delightful
people
who
had
been
asked
to
meet
her
and
the
atmosphere
was
one
of
polite
bewilderment
her
tastes
were
simple
her
knowledge
of
culture
slight
and
she
was
not
interested
in
the
new
english
art
club
nor
in
the
between
journalism
and
literature
which
was
started
as
a
conversational
hare
the
delightful
people
darted
after
it
with
cries
of
joy
margaret
leading
them
and
not
till
the
meal
was
half
over
did
they
realize
that
the
principal
guest
had
taken
no
part
in
the
chase
there
was
no
common
topic
wilcox
whose
life
had
been
spent
in
the
service
of
husband
and
sons
had
little
to
say
to
strangers
who
had
never
shared
it
and
whose
age
was
half
her
own
clever
talk
alarmed
her
and
withered
her
delicate
imaginings
it
was
the
social
counterpart
of
a
motorcar
all
jerks
and
she
was
a
wisp
of
hay
a
flower
twice
she
deplored
the
weather
twice
criticized
the
train
service
on
the
great
northern
railway
they
vigorously
assented
and
rushed
on
and
when
she
inquired
whether
there
was
any
news
of
helen
her
hostess
was
too
much
occupied
in
placing
rothenstein
to
answer
the
question
was
repeated
i
hope
that
your
sister
is
safe
in
germany
by
now
margaret
checked
herself
and
said
yes
thank
you
i
heard
on
tuesday
but
the
demon
of
vociferation
was
in
her
and
the
next
moment
she
was
off
again
only
on
tuesday
for
they
live
right
away
at
stettin
did
you
ever
know
any
one
living
at
stettin
never
said
wilcox
gravely
while
her
neighbour
a
young
man
low
down
in
the
education
office
began
to
discuss
what
people
who
lived
at
stettin
ought
to
look
like
was
there
such
a
thing
as
stettininity
margaret
swept
on
people
at
stettin
drop
things
into
boats
out
of
overhanging
warehouses
at
least
our
cousins
do
but
are
particularly
rich
the
town
is
interesting
except
for
a
clock
that
rolls
its
eyes
and
the
view
of
the
oder
which
truly
is
something
special
oh
wilcox
you
would
love
the
oder
the
river
or
rather
rivers
there
seem
to
be
dozens
of
them
are
intense
blue
and
the
plain
they
run
through
an
intensest
green
indeed
that
sounds
like
a
most
beautiful
view
miss
schlegel
so
i
say
but
helen
who
will
muddle
things
says
no
it
like
music
the
course
of
the
oder
is
to
be
like
music
it
obliged
to
remind
her
of
a
symphonic
poem
the
part
by
the
is
in
b
minor
if
i
remember
rightly
but
lower
down
things
get
extremely
mixed
there
is
a
slodgy
theme
in
several
keys
at
once
meaning
and
another
for
the
navigable
canal
and
the
exit
into
the
baltic
is
in
c
sharp
major
pianissimo
what
do
the
overhanging
warehouses
make
of
that
asked
the
man
laughing
they
make
a
great
deal
of
it
replied
margaret
unexpectedly
rushing
off
on
a
new
track
i
think
affectation
to
compare
the
oder
to
music
and
so
do
you
but
the
overhanging
warehouses
of
stettin
take
beauty
seriously
which
we
do
and
the
average
englishman
does
and
despises
all
who
do
now
do
say
have
no
taste
or
i
shall
scream
they
have
but
but
such
a
tremendous
but
they
take
poetry
seriously
they
do
take
poetry
seriously
is
anything
gained
by
that
yes
yes
the
german
is
always
on
the
lookout
for
beauty
he
may
miss
it
through
stupidity
or
misinterpret
it
but
he
is
always
asking
beauty
to
enter
his
life
and
i
believe
that
in
the
end
it
will
come
at
heidelberg
i
met
a
fat
veterinary
surgeon
whose
voice
broke
with
sobs
as
he
repeated
some
mawkish
poetry
so
easy
for
me
to
laugh
i
who
never
repeat
poetry
good
or
bad
and
can
not
remember
one
fragment
of
verse
to
thrill
myself
with
my
blood
boils
well
i
half
german
so
put
it
down
to
patriotism
when
i
listen
to
the
tasteful
contempt
of
the
average
islander
for
things
teutonic
whether
bocklin
or
my
veterinary
surgeon
bocklin
they
say
strains
after
beauty
he
peoples
nature
with
gods
too
consciously
of
course
bocklin
strains
because
he
wants
something
beauty
and
all
the
other
intangible
gifts
that
are
floating
about
the
world
so
his
landscapes
do
come
off
and
leader
do
i
am
not
sure
that
i
agree
do
you
said
he
turning
to
wilcox
she
replied
i
think
miss
schlegel
puts
everything
splendidly
and
a
chill
fell
on
the
conversation
oh
wilcox
say
something
nicer
than
that
such
a
snub
to
be
told
you
put
things
i
do
not
mean
it
as
a
snub
your
last
speech
interested
me
so
much
generally
people
do
not
seem
quite
to
like
germany
i
have
long
wanted
to
hear
what
is
said
on
the
other
side
the
other
side
then
you
do
disagree
oh
good
give
us
your
side
i
have
no
side
but
my
husband
her
voice
softened
the
chill
increased
has
very
little
faith
in
the
continent
and
our
children
have
all
taken
after
him
on
what
grounds
do
they
feel
that
the
continent
is
in
bad
form
wilcox
had
no
idea
she
paid
little
attention
to
grounds
she
was
not
intellectual
nor
even
alert
and
it
was
odd
that
all
the
same
she
should
give
the
idea
of
greatness
margaret
zigzagging
with
her
friends
over
thought
and
art
was
conscious
of
a
personality
that
transcended
their
own
and
dwarfed
their
activities
there
was
no
bitterness
in
wilcox
there
was
not
even
criticism
she
was
lovable
and
no
ungracious
or
uncharitable
word
had
passed
her
lips
yet
she
and
daily
life
were
out
of
focus
one
or
the
other
must
show
blurred
and
at
lunch
she
seemed
more
out
of
focus
than
usual
and
nearer
the
line
that
divides
life
from
a
life
that
may
be
of
greater
importance
you
will
admit
though
that
the
continent
it
seems
silly
to
speak
of
continent
but
really
it
is
all
more
like
itself
than
any
part
of
it
is
like
england
england
is
unique
do
have
another
jelly
first
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
continent
for
good
or
for
evil
is
interested
in
ideas
its
literature
and
art
have
what
one
might
call
the
kink
of
the
unseen
about
them
and
this
persists
even
through
decadence
and
affectation
there
is
more
liberty
of
action
in
england
but
for
liberty
of
thought
go
to
bureaucratic
prussia
people
will
there
discuss
with
humility
vital
questions
that
we
here
think
ourselves
too
good
to
touch
with
tongs
i
do
not
want
to
go
to
prussian
said
wilcox
not
even
to
see
that
interesting
view
that
you
were
describing
and
for
discussing
with
humility
i
am
too
old
we
never
discuss
anything
at
howards
end
then
you
ought
to
said
margaret
discussion
keeps
a
house
alive
it
can
not
stand
by
bricks
and
mortar
alone
it
can
not
stand
without
them
said
wilcox
unexpectedly
catching
on
to
the
thought
and
rousing
for
the
first
and
last
time
a
faint
hope
in
the
breasts
of
the
delightful
people
it
can
not
stand
without
them
and
i
sometimes
think
but
i
can
not
expect
your
generation
to
agree
for
even
my
daughter
disagrees
with
me
here
never
mind
us
or
her
do
say
i
sometimes
think
that
it
is
wiser
to
leave
action
and
discussion
to
men
there
was
a
little
silence
one
admits
that
the
arguments
against
the
suffrage
are
extraordinarily
strong
said
a
girl
opposite
leaning
forward
and
crumbling
her
bread
are
they
i
never
follow
any
arguments
i
am
only
too
thankful
not
to
have
a
vote
myself
we
did
mean
the
vote
though
did
we
supplied
margaret
are
we
differing
on
something
much
wider
wilcox
whether
women
are
to
remain
what
they
have
been
since
the
dawn
of
history
or
whether
since
men
have
moved
forward
so
far
they
too
may
move
forward
a
little
now
i
say
they
may
i
would
even
admit
a
biological
change
i
do
know
i
do
know
i
must
be
getting
back
to
my
overhanging
warehouse
said
the
man
they
turned
disgracefully
strict
wilcox
also
rose
oh
but
come
upstairs
for
a
little
miss
quested
plays
do
you
like
macdowell
do
you
mind
him
only
having
two
noises
if
you
must
really
go
i
see
you
out
you
even
have
coffee
they
left
the
closing
the
door
behind
them
and
as
wilcox
buttoned
up
her
jacket
she
said
what
an
interesting
life
you
all
lead
in
london
no
we
do
said
margaret
with
a
sudden
revulsion
we
lead
the
lives
of
gibbering
monkeys
wilcox
really
we
have
something
quiet
and
stable
at
the
bottom
we
really
have
all
my
friends
have
pretend
you
enjoyed
lunch
for
you
loathed
it
but
forgive
me
by
coming
again
alone
or
by
asking
me
to
you
i
am
used
to
young
people
said
wilcox
and
with
each
word
she
spoke
the
outlines
of
known
things
grew
dim
i
hear
a
great
deal
of
chatter
at
home
for
we
like
you
entertain
a
great
deal
with
us
it
is
more
sport
and
politics
but
i
enjoyed
my
lunch
very
much
miss
schlegel
dear
and
am
not
pretending
and
only
wish
i
could
have
joined
in
more
for
one
thing
i
not
particularly
well
just
today
for
another
you
younger
people
move
so
quickly
that
it
dazes
me
charles
is
the
same
dolly
the
same
but
we
are
all
in
the
same
boat
old
and
young
i
never
forget
that
they
were
silent
for
a
moment
then
with
a
newborn
emotion
they
shook
hands
the
conversation
ceased
suddenly
when
margaret
the
her
friends
had
been
talking
over
her
new
friend
and
had
dismissed
her
as
uninteresting
chapter
several
days
passed
was
wilcox
one
of
the
unsatisfactory
people
there
are
many
of
them
who
dangle
intimacy
and
then
withdraw
it
they
evoke
our
interests
and
affections
and
keep
the
life
of
the
spirit
dawdling
round
them
then
they
withdraw
when
physical
passion
is
involved
there
is
a
definite
name
for
such
behaviour
flirting
and
if
carried
far
enough
it
is
punishable
by
law
but
no
law
not
public
opinion
even
punishes
those
who
coquette
with
friendship
though
the
dull
ache
that
they
inflict
the
sense
of
misdirected
effort
and
exhaustion
may
be
as
intolerable
was
she
one
of
these
margaret
feared
so
at
first
for
with
a
impatience
she
wanted
everything
to
be
settled
up
immediately
she
mistrusted
the
periods
of
quiet
that
are
essential
to
true
growth
desiring
to
book
wilcox
as
a
friend
she
pressed
on
the
ceremony
pencil
as
it
were
in
hand
pressing
the
more
because
the
rest
of
the
family
were
away
and
the
opportunity
seemed
favourable
but
the
elder
woman
would
not
be
hurried
she
refused
to
fit
in
with
the
wickham
place
set
or
to
reopen
discussion
of
helen
and
paul
whom
margaret
would
have
utilized
as
a
she
took
her
time
or
perhaps
let
time
take
her
and
when
the
crisis
did
come
all
was
ready
the
crisis
opened
with
a
message
would
miss
schlegel
come
shopping
christmas
was
nearing
and
wilcox
felt
with
the
presents
she
had
taken
some
more
days
in
bed
and
must
make
up
for
lost
time
margaret
accepted
and
at
eleven
one
cheerless
morning
they
started
out
in
a
brougham
first
of
all
began
margaret
we
must
make
a
list
and
tick
off
the
people
names
my
aunt
always
does
and
this
fog
may
thicken
up
any
moment
have
you
any
ideas
i
thought
we
would
go
to
harrod
or
the
haymarket
stores
said
wilcox
rather
hopelessly
everything
is
sure
to
be
there
i
am
not
a
good
shopper
the
din
is
so
confusing
and
your
aunt
is
quite
right
one
ought
to
make
a
list
take
my
notebook
then
and
write
your
own
name
at
the
top
of
the
page
oh
hooray
said
margaret
writing
it
how
very
kind
of
you
to
start
with
me
but
she
did
not
want
to
receive
anything
expensive
their
acquaintance
was
singular
rather
than
intimate
and
she
divined
that
the
wilcox
clan
would
resent
any
expenditure
on
outsiders
the
more
compact
families
do
she
did
not
want
to
be
thought
a
second
helen
who
would
snatch
presents
since
she
could
not
snatch
young
men
nor
to
be
exposed
like
a
second
aunt
juley
to
the
insults
of
charles
a
certain
austerity
of
demeanour
was
best
and
she
added
i
do
really
want
a
yuletide
gift
though
in
fact
i
rather
not
why
because
i
odd
ideas
about
christmas
because
i
have
all
that
money
can
buy
i
want
more
people
but
no
more
things
i
should
like
to
give
you
something
worth
your
acquaintance
miss
schlegel
in
memory
of
your
kindness
to
me
during
my
lonely
fortnight
it
has
so
happened
that
i
have
been
left
alone
and
you
have
stopped
me
from
brooding
i
am
too
apt
to
brood
if
that
is
so
said
margaret
if
i
have
happened
to
be
of
use
to
you
which
i
did
know
you
can
not
pay
me
back
with
anything
tangible
i
suppose
not
but
one
would
like
to
perhaps
i
shall
think
of
something
as
we
go
about
her
name
remained
at
the
head
of
the
list
but
nothing
was
written
opposite
it
they
drove
from
shop
to
shop
the
air
was
white
and
when
they
alighted
it
tasted
like
cold
pennies
at
times
they
passed
through
a
clot
of
grey
wilcox
vitality
was
low
that
morning
and
it
was
margaret
who
decided
on
a
horse
for
this
little
girl
a
golliwog
for
that
for
the
rector
wife
a
copper
we
always
give
the
servants
money
yes
do
you
yes
much
easier
replied
margaret
but
felt
the
grotesque
impact
of
the
unseen
upon
the
seen
and
saw
issuing
from
a
forgotten
manger
at
bethlehem
this
torrent
of
coins
and
toys
vulgarity
reigned
besides
their
usual
exhortation
against
temperance
reform
invited
men
to
join
our
christmas
goose
club
one
bottle
of
gin
or
two
according
to
subscription
a
poster
of
a
woman
in
tights
heralded
the
christmas
pantomime
and
little
red
devils
who
had
come
in
again
that
year
were
prevalent
upon
the
margaret
was
no
morbid
idealist
she
did
not
wish
this
spate
of
business
and
checked
it
was
only
the
occasion
of
it
that
struck
her
with
amazement
annually
how
many
of
these
vacillating
shoppers
and
tired
realized
that
it
was
a
divine
event
that
drew
them
together
she
realized
it
though
standing
outside
in
the
matter
she
was
not
a
christian
in
the
accepted
sense
she
did
not
believe
that
god
had
ever
worked
among
us
as
a
young
artisan
these
people
or
most
of
them
believed
it
and
if
pressed
would
affirm
it
in
words
but
the
visible
signs
of
their
belief
were
regent
street
or
drury
lane
a
little
mud
displaced
a
little
money
spent
a
little
food
cooked
eaten
and
forgotten
inadequate
but
in
public
who
shall
express
the
unseen
adequately
it
is
private
life
that
holds
out
the
mirror
to
infinity
personal
intercourse
and
that
alone
that
ever
hints
at
a
personality
beyond
our
daily
vision
no
i
do
like
christmas
on
the
whole
she
announced
in
its
clumsy
way
it
does
approach
peace
and
goodwill
but
oh
it
is
clumsier
every
year
is
it
i
am
only
used
to
country
christmases
we
are
usually
in
london
and
play
the
game
with
vigour
carols
at
the
abbey
clumsy
midday
meal
clumsy
dinner
for
the
maids
followed
by
and
dancing
of
poor
children
with
songs
from
helen
the
does
very
well
for
that
we
put
the
tree
in
the
and
draw
a
curtain
when
the
candles
are
lighted
and
with
the
behind
it
looks
quite
pretty
i
wish
we
might
have
a
in
our
next
house
of
course
the
tree
has
to
be
very
small
and
the
presents
do
hang
on
it
no
the
presents
reside
in
a
sort
of
rocky
landscape
made
of
crumpled
brown
paper
you
spoke
of
your
house
miss
schlegel
then
are
you
leaving
wickham
place
yes
in
two
or
three
years
when
the
lease
expires
we
must
have
you
been
there
long
all
our
lives
you
will
be
very
sorry
to
leave
it
i
suppose
so
we
scarcely
realize
it
yet
my
father
she
broke
off
for
they
had
reached
the
stationery
department
of
the
haymarket
stores
and
wilcox
wanted
to
order
some
private
greeting
cards
if
possible
something
distinctive
she
sighed
at
the
counter
she
found
a
friend
bent
on
the
same
errand
and
conversed
with
her
insipidly
wasting
much
time
my
husband
and
our
daughter
are
motoring
bertha
too
oh
fancy
what
a
coincidence
margaret
though
not
practical
could
shine
in
such
company
as
this
while
they
talked
she
went
through
a
volume
of
specimen
cards
and
submitted
one
for
wilcox
inspection
wilcox
was
delighted
so
original
words
so
sweet
she
would
order
a
hundred
like
that
and
could
never
be
sufficiently
grateful
then
just
as
the
assistant
was
booking
the
order
she
said
do
you
know
i
wait
on
second
thoughts
i
wait
there
plenty
of
time
still
there
and
i
shall
be
able
to
get
evie
opinion
they
returned
to
the
carriage
by
devious
paths
when
they
were
in
she
said
but
could
you
get
it
renewed
i
beg
your
pardon
asked
margaret
the
lease
i
mean
oh
the
lease
have
you
been
thinking
of
that
all
the
time
how
very
kind
of
you
surely
something
could
be
done
no
values
have
risen
too
enormously
they
mean
to
pull
down
wickham
place
and
build
flats
like
yours
but
how
horrible
landlords
are
horrible
then
she
said
vehemently
it
is
monstrous
miss
schlegel
it
is
right
i
had
no
idea
that
this
was
hanging
over
you
i
do
pity
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
to
be
parted
from
your
house
your
house
it
ought
to
be
allowed
it
is
worse
than
dying
i
would
rather
die
than
oh
poor
girls
can
what
they
call
civilization
be
right
if
people
may
die
in
the
room
where
they
were
born
my
dear
i
am
so
sorry
margaret
did
not
know
what
to
say
wilcox
had
been
overtired
by
the
shopping
and
was
inclined
to
hysteria
howards
end
was
nearly
pulled
down
once
it
would
have
killed
me
howards
end
must
be
a
very
different
house
to
ours
we
are
fond
of
ours
but
there
is
nothing
distinctive
about
it
as
you
saw
it
is
an
ordinary
london
house
we
shall
easily
find
another
so
you
think
again
my
lack
of
experience
i
suppose
said
margaret
easing
away
from
the
subject
i
ca
say
anything
when
you
take
up
that
line
wilcox
i
wish
i
could
see
myself
as
you
see
me
foreshortened
into
a
backfisch
quite
the
ingenue
very
charming
wonderfully
well
read
for
my
age
but
incapable
wilcox
would
not
be
deterred
come
down
with
me
to
howards
end
now
she
said
more
vehemently
than
ever
i
want
you
to
see
it
you
have
never
seen
it
i
want
to
hear
what
you
say
about
it
for
you
do
put
things
so
wonderfully
margaret
glanced
at
the
pitiless
air
and
then
at
the
tired
face
of
her
companion
later
on
i
should
love
it
she
continued
but
it
hardly
the
weather
for
such
an
expedition
and
we
ought
to
start
when
we
fresh
the
house
shut
up
too
she
received
no
answer
wilcox
appeared
to
be
annoyed
might
i
come
some
other
day
wilcox
bent
forward
and
tapped
the
glass
back
to
wickham
place
please
was
her
order
to
the
coachman
margaret
had
been
snubbed
a
thousand
thanks
miss
schlegel
for
all
your
help
not
at
all
it
is
such
a
comfort
to
get
the
presents
off
my
mind
the
especially
i
do
admire
your
choice
it
was
her
turn
to
receive
no
answer
in
her
turn
margaret
became
annoyed
my
husband
and
evie
will
be
back
the
day
after
tomorrow
that
is
why
i
dragged
you
out
shopping
today
i
stayed
in
town
chiefly
to
shop
but
got
through
nothing
and
now
he
writes
that
they
must
cut
their
tour
short
the
weather
is
so
bad
and
the
have
been
so
bad
nearly
as
bad
as
in
surrey
ours
is
such
a
careful
chauffeur
and
my
husband
feels
it
particularly
hard
that
they
should
be
treated
like
roadhogs
why
well
naturally
he
he
is
a
he
was
exceeding
the
i
conclude
he
must
expect
to
suffer
with
the
lower
animals
wilcox
was
silenced
in
growing
discomfort
they
drove
homewards
the
city
seemed
satanic
the
narrower
streets
oppressing
like
the
galleries
of
a
mine
no
harm
was
done
by
the
fog
to
trade
for
it
lay
high
and
the
lighted
windows
of
the
shops
were
thronged
with
customers
it
was
rather
a
darkening
of
the
spirit
which
fell
back
upon
itself
to
find
a
more
grievous
darkness
within
margaret
nearly
spoke
a
dozen
times
but
something
throttled
her
she
felt
petty
and
awkward
and
her
meditations
on
christmas
grew
more
cynical
peace
it
may
bring
other
gifts
but
is
there
a
single
londoner
to
whom
christmas
is
peaceful
the
craving
for
excitement
and
for
elaboration
has
ruined
that
blessing
goodwill
had
she
seen
any
example
of
it
in
the
hordes
of
purchasers
or
in
herself
she
had
failed
to
respond
to
this
invitation
merely
because
it
was
a
little
queer
and
imaginative
she
whose
birthright
it
was
to
nourish
imagination
better
to
have
accepted
to
have
tired
themselves
a
little
by
the
journey
than
coldly
to
reply
might
i
come
some
other
day
her
cynicism
left
her
there
would
be
no
other
day
this
shadowy
woman
would
never
ask
her
again
they
parted
at
the
mansions
wilcox
went
in
after
due
civilities
and
margaret
watched
the
tall
lonely
figure
sweep
up
the
hall
to
the
lift
as
the
glass
doors
closed
on
it
she
had
the
sense
of
an
imprisonment
the
beautiful
head
disappeared
first
still
buried
in
the
muff
the
long
trailing
skirt
followed
a
woman
of
undefinable
rarity
was
going
up
like
a
specimen
in
a
bottle
and
into
what
a
heaven
a
vault
as
of
hell
sooty
black
from
which
soots
descended
at
lunch
her
brother
seeing
her
inclined
for
silence
insisted
on
talking
tibby
was
not
but
from
babyhood
something
drove
him
to
do
the
unwelcome
and
the
unexpected
now
he
gave
her
a
long
account
of
the
that
he
sometimes
patronized
the
account
was
interesting
and
she
had
often
pressed
him
for
it
before
but
she
could
not
attend
now
for
her
mind
was
focussed
on
the
invisible
she
discerned
that
wilcox
though
a
loving
wife
and
mother
had
only
one
passion
in
life
her
house
and
that
the
moment
was
solemn
when
she
invited
a
friend
to
share
this
passion
with
her
to
answer
another
day
was
to
answer
as
a
fool
another
day
will
do
for
brick
and
mortar
but
not
for
the
holy
of
holies
into
which
howards
end
had
been
transfigured
her
own
curiosity
was
slight
she
had
heard
more
than
enough
about
it
in
the
summer
the
nine
windows
the
vine
and
the
had
no
pleasant
connections
for
her
and
she
would
have
preferred
to
spend
the
afternoon
at
a
concert
but
imagination
triumphed
while
her
brother
held
forth
she
determined
to
go
at
whatever
cost
and
to
compel
wilcox
to
go
too
when
lunch
was
over
she
stepped
over
to
the
flats
wilcox
had
just
gone
away
for
the
night
margaret
said
that
it
was
of
no
consequence
hurried
downstairs
and
took
a
hansom
to
king
cross
she
was
convinced
that
the
escapade
was
important
though
it
would
have
puzzled
her
to
say
why
there
was
a
question
of
imprisonment
and
escape
and
though
she
did
not
know
the
time
of
the
train
she
strained
her
eyes
for
the
pancras
clock
then
the
clock
of
king
cross
swung
into
sight
a
second
moon
in
that
infernal
sky
and
her
cab
drew
up
at
the
station
there
was
a
train
for
hilton
in
five
minutes
she
took
a
ticket
asking
in
her
agitation
for
a
single
as
she
did
so
a
grave
and
happy
voice
saluted
her
and
thanked
her
i
will
come
if
i
still
may
said
margaret
laughing
nervously
you
are
coming
to
sleep
dear
too
it
is
in
the
morning
that
my
house
is
most
beautiful
you
are
coming
to
stop
i
can
not
show
you
my
meadow
properly
except
at
sunrise
these
fogs
she
pointed
at
the
station
roof
never
spread
far
i
dare
say
they
are
sitting
in
the
sun
in
hertfordshire
and
you
will
never
repent
joining
them
i
shall
never
repent
joining
you
it
is
the
same
they
began
the
walk
up
the
long
platform
far
at
its
end
stood
the
train
breasting
the
darkness
without
they
never
reached
it
before
imagination
could
triumph
there
were
cries
of
mother
mother
and
a
girl
darted
out
of
the
and
seized
wilcox
by
the
arm
evie
she
gasped
evie
my
pet
the
girl
called
father
i
say
look
who
here
evie
dearest
girl
why
are
you
in
yorkshire
no
motor
smash
changed
plans
father
coming
why
ruth
cried
wilcox
joining
them
what
in
the
name
of
all
that
wonderful
are
you
doing
here
ruth
wilcox
had
recovered
herself
oh
henry
dear
here
a
lovely
surprise
but
let
me
introduce
but
i
think
you
know
miss
schlegel
oh
yes
he
replied
not
greatly
interested
but
how
yourself
ruth
fit
as
a
fiddle
she
answered
gaily
so
are
we
and
so
was
our
car
which
ran
as
far
as
ripon
but
there
a
wretched
horse
and
cart
which
a
fool
of
a
driver
miss
schlegel
our
little
outing
must
be
for
another
day
i
was
saying
that
this
fool
of
a
driver
as
the
policeman
himself
admits
another
day
wilcox
of
course
but
as
we
insured
against
third
party
risks
it
wo
so
much
matter
cart
and
car
being
practically
at
right
angles
the
voices
of
the
happy
family
rose
high
margaret
was
left
alone
no
one
wanted
her
wilcox
walked
out
of
king
cross
between
her
husband
and
her
daughter
listening
to
both
of
them
chapter
the
funeral
was
over
the
carriages
rolled
away
through
the
soft
mud
and
only
the
poor
remained
they
approached
to
the
shaft
and
looked
their
last
at
the
coffin
now
almost
hidden
beneath
the
spadefuls
of
clay
it
was
their
moment
most
of
them
were
women
from
the
dead
district
to
whom
black
garments
had
been
served
out
by
wilcox
orders
pure
curiosity
had
brought
others
they
thrilled
with
the
excitement
of
a
death
and
of
a
rapid
death
and
stood
in
groups
or
moved
between
the
graves
like
drops
of
ink
the
son
of
one
of
them
a
was
perched
high
above
their
heads
pollarding
one
of
the
churchyard
elms
from
where
he
sat
he
could
see
the
village
of
hilton
strung
upon
the
north
road
with
its
accreting
suburbs
the
sunset
beyond
scarlet
and
orange
winking
at
him
beneath
brows
of
grey
the
church
the
plantations
and
behind
him
an
unspoilt
country
of
fields
and
farms
but
he
too
was
rolling
the
event
luxuriously
in
his
mouth
he
tried
to
tell
his
mother
down
below
all
that
he
had
felt
when
he
saw
the
coffin
approaching
how
he
could
not
leave
his
work
and
yet
did
not
like
to
go
on
with
it
how
he
had
almost
slipped
out
of
the
tree
he
was
so
upset
the
rooks
had
cawed
and
no
wonder
it
was
as
if
rooks
knew
too
his
mother
claimed
the
prophetic
power
herself
she
had
seen
a
strange
look
about
wilcox
for
some
time
london
had
done
the
mischief
said
others
she
had
been
a
kind
lady
her
grandmother
had
been
kind
too
a
plainer
person
but
very
kind
ah
the
old
sort
was
dying
out
wilcox
he
was
a
kind
gentleman
they
advanced
to
the
topic
again
and
again
dully
but
with
exaltation
the
funeral
of
a
rich
person
was
to
them
what
the
funeral
of
alcestis
or
ophelia
is
to
the
educated
it
was
art
though
remote
from
life
it
enhanced
life
values
and
they
witnessed
it
avidly
the
who
had
kept
up
an
undercurrent
of
disapproval
they
disliked
charles
it
was
not
a
moment
to
speak
of
such
things
but
they
did
not
like
charles
wilcox
the
finished
their
work
and
piled
up
the
wreaths
and
crosses
above
it
the
sun
set
over
hilton
the
grey
brows
of
the
evening
flushed
a
little
and
were
cleft
with
one
scarlet
frown
chattering
sadly
to
each
other
the
mourners
passed
through
the
and
traversed
the
chestnut
avenues
that
led
down
to
the
village
the
young
stayed
a
little
longer
poised
above
the
silence
and
swaying
rhythmically
at
last
the
bough
fell
beneath
his
saw
with
a
grunt
he
descended
his
thoughts
dwelling
no
longer
on
death
but
on
love
for
he
was
mating
he
stopped
as
he
passed
the
new
grave
a
sheaf
of
tawny
chrysanthemums
had
caught
his
eye
they
did
ought
to
have
coloured
flowers
at
buryings
he
reflected
trudging
on
a
few
steps
he
stopped
again
looked
furtively
at
the
dusk
turned
back
wrenched
a
chrysanthemum
from
the
sheaf
and
hid
it
in
his
pocket
after
him
came
silence
absolute
the
cottage
that
abutted
on
the
churchyard
was
empty
and
no
other
house
stood
near
hour
after
hour
the
scene
of
the
interment
remained
without
an
eye
to
witness
it
clouds
drifted
over
it
from
the
west
or
the
church
may
have
been
a
ship
steering
with
all
its
company
towards
infinity
towards
morning
the
air
grew
colder
the
sky
clearer
the
surface
of
the
earth
hard
and
sparkling
above
the
prostrate
dead
the
returning
after
a
night
of
joy
reflected
they
lilies
they
chrysants
a
pity
i
did
take
them
all
up
at
howards
end
they
were
attempting
breakfast
charles
and
evie
sat
in
the
with
charles
their
father
who
could
not
bear
to
see
a
face
breakfasted
upstairs
he
suffered
acutely
pain
came
over
him
in
spasms
as
if
it
was
physical
and
even
while
he
was
about
to
eat
his
eyes
would
fill
with
tears
and
he
would
lay
down
the
morsel
untasted
he
remembered
his
wife
even
goodness
during
thirty
years
not
anything
in
detail
not
courtship
or
early
raptures
but
just
the
unvarying
virtue
that
seemed
to
him
a
woman
noblest
quality
so
many
women
are
capricious
breaking
into
odd
flaws
of
passion
or
frivolity
not
so
his
wife
year
after
year
summer
and
winter
as
bride
and
mother
she
had
been
the
same
he
had
always
trusted
her
her
tenderness
her
innocence
the
wonderful
innocence
that
was
hers
by
the
gift
of
god
ruth
knew
no
more
of
worldly
wickedness
and
wisdom
than
did
the
flowers
in
her
garden
or
the
grass
in
her
field
her
idea
of
business
henry
why
do
people
who
have
enough
money
try
to
get
more
money
her
idea
of
politics
i
am
sure
that
if
the
mothers
of
various
nations
could
meet
there
would
be
no
more
wars
her
idea
of
religion
ah
this
had
been
a
cloud
but
a
cloud
that
passed
she
came
of
quaker
stock
and
he
and
his
family
formerly
dissenters
were
now
members
of
the
church
of
england
the
rector
sermons
had
at
first
repelled
her
and
she
had
expressed
a
desire
for
a
more
inward
light
adding
not
so
much
for
myself
as
for
baby
charles
inward
light
must
have
been
granted
for
he
heard
no
complaints
in
later
years
they
brought
up
their
three
children
without
dispute
they
had
never
disputed
she
lay
under
the
earth
now
she
had
gone
and
as
if
to
make
her
going
the
more
bitter
had
gone
with
a
touch
of
mystery
that
was
all
unlike
her
why
did
you
tell
me
you
knew
of
it
he
had
moaned
and
her
faint
voice
had
answered
i
did
want
to
henry
i
might
have
been
wrong
and
every
one
hates
illnesses
he
had
been
told
of
the
horror
by
a
strange
doctor
whom
she
had
consulted
during
his
absence
from
town
was
this
altogether
just
without
fully
explaining
she
had
died
it
was
a
fault
on
her
part
and
tears
rushed
into
his
eyes
what
a
little
fault
it
was
the
only
time
she
had
deceived
him
in
those
thirty
years
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
out
of
the
window
for
evie
had
come
in
with
the
letters
and
he
could
meet
no
one
eye
ah
yes
she
had
been
a
good
woman
she
had
been
steady
he
chose
the
word
deliberately
to
him
steadiness
included
all
praise
he
himself
gazing
at
the
wintry
garden
is
in
appearance
a
steady
man
his
face
was
not
as
square
as
his
son
and
indeed
the
chin
though
firm
enough
in
outline
retreated
a
little
and
the
lips
ambiguous
were
curtained
by
a
moustache
but
there
was
no
external
hint
of
weakness
the
eyes
if
capable
of
kindness
and
goodfellowship
if
ruddy
for
the
moment
with
tears
were
the
eyes
of
one
who
could
not
be
driven
the
forehead
too
was
like
charles
high
and
straight
brown
and
polished
merging
abruptly
into
temples
and
skull
it
has
the
effect
of
a
bastion
that
protected
his
head
from
the
world
at
times
it
had
the
effect
of
a
blank
wall
he
had
dwelt
behind
it
intact
and
happy
for
fifty
years
the
post
come
father
said
evie
awkwardly
thanks
put
it
down
has
the
breakfast
been
all
right
yes
thanks
the
girl
glanced
at
him
and
at
it
with
constraint
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
charles
says
do
you
want
the
times
no
i
read
it
later
ring
if
you
want
anything
father
wo
you
i
all
i
want
having
sorted
the
letters
from
the
circulars
she
went
back
to
the
father
eaten
nothing
she
announced
sitting
down
with
wrinkled
brows
behind
the
charles
did
not
answer
but
after
a
moment
he
ran
quickly
upstairs
opened
the
door
and
said
look
here
father
you
must
eat
you
know
and
having
paused
for
a
reply
that
did
not
come
stole
down
again
he
going
to
read
his
letters
first
i
think
he
said
evasively
i
dare
say
he
will
go
on
with
his
breakfast
afterwards
then
he
took
up
the
times
and
for
some
time
there
was
no
sound
except
the
clink
of
cup
against
saucer
and
of
knife
on
plate
poor
charles
sat
between
her
silent
companions
terrified
at
the
course
of
events
and
a
little
bored
she
was
a
rubbishy
little
creature
and
she
knew
it
a
telegram
had
dragged
her
from
naples
to
the
of
a
woman
whom
she
had
scarcely
known
a
word
from
her
husband
had
plunged
her
into
mourning
she
desired
to
mourn
inwardly
as
well
but
she
wished
that
wilcox
since
fated
to
die
could
have
died
before
the
marriage
for
then
less
would
have
been
expected
of
her
crumbling
her
toast
and
too
nervous
to
ask
for
the
butter
she
remained
almost
motionless
thankful
only
for
this
that
her
was
having
his
breakfast
upstairs
at
last
charles
spoke
they
had
no
business
to
be
pollarding
those
elms
yesterday
he
said
to
his
sister
no
indeed
i
must
make
a
note
of
that
he
continued
i
am
surprised
that
the
rector
allowed
it
perhaps
it
may
not
be
the
rector
affair
whose
else
could
it
be
the
lord
of
the
manor
impossible
butter
dolly
thank
you
evie
dear
charles
yes
dear
i
did
know
one
could
pollard
elms
i
thought
one
only
pollarded
willows
oh
no
one
can
pollard
elms
then
why
ought
the
elms
in
the
churchyard
to
be
pollarded
charles
frowned
a
little
and
turned
again
to
his
sister
another
point
i
must
speak
to
chalkeley
yes
rather
you
must
complain
to
chalkeley
it
no
good
him
saying
he
is
not
responsible
for
those
men
he
is
responsible
yes
rather
brother
and
sister
were
not
callous
they
spoke
thus
partly
because
they
desired
to
keep
chalkeley
up
to
the
mark
a
healthy
desire
in
its
way
partly
because
they
avoided
the
personal
note
in
life
all
wilcoxes
did
it
did
not
seem
to
them
of
supreme
importance
or
it
may
be
as
helen
supposed
they
realized
its
importance
but
were
afraid
of
it
panic
and
emptiness
could
one
glance
behind
they
were
not
callous
and
they
left
the
with
aching
hearts
their
mother
never
had
come
in
to
breakfast
it
was
in
the
other
rooms
and
especially
in
the
garden
that
they
felt
her
loss
most
as
charles
went
out
to
the
garage
he
was
reminded
at
every
step
of
the
woman
who
had
loved
him
and
whom
he
could
never
replace
what
battles
he
had
fought
against
her
gentle
conservatism
how
she
had
disliked
improvements
yet
how
loyally
she
had
accepted
them
when
made
he
and
his
father
what
trouble
they
had
had
to
get
this
very
garage
with
what
difficulty
had
they
persuaded
her
to
yield
them
to
the
paddock
for
it
the
paddock
that
she
loved
more
dearly
than
the
garden
itself
the
vine
she
had
got
her
way
about
the
vine
it
still
encumbered
the
south
wall
with
its
unproductive
branches
and
so
with
evie
as
she
stood
talking
to
the
cook
though
she
could
take
up
her
mother
work
inside
the
house
just
as
the
man
could
take
it
up
without
she
felt
that
something
unique
had
fallen
out
of
her
life
their
grief
though
less
poignant
than
their
father
grew
from
deeper
roots
for
a
wife
may
be
replaced
a
mother
never
charles
would
go
back
to
the
office
there
was
little
to
do
at
howards
end
the
contents
of
his
mother
will
had
been
long
known
to
them
there
were
no
legacies
no
annuities
none
of
the
posthumous
bustle
with
which
some
of
the
dead
prolong
their
activities
trusting
her
husband
she
had
left
him
everything
without
reserve
she
was
quite
a
poor
woman
the
house
had
been
all
her
dowry
and
the
house
would
come
to
charles
in
time
her
wilcox
intended
to
reserve
for
paul
while
evie
would
take
the
jewellery
and
lace
how
easily
she
slipped
out
of
life
charles
thought
the
habit
laudable
though
he
did
not
intend
to
adopt
it
himself
whereas
margaret
would
have
seen
in
it
an
almost
culpable
indifference
to
earthly
fame
cynicism
not
the
superficial
cynicism
that
snarls
and
sneers
but
the
cynicism
that
can
go
with
courtesy
and
tenderness
that
was
the
note
of
wilcox
will
she
wanted
not
to
vex
people
that
accomplished
the
earth
might
freeze
over
her
for
ever
no
there
was
nothing
for
charles
to
wait
for
he
could
not
go
on
with
his
honeymoon
so
he
would
go
up
to
london
and
work
he
felt
too
miserable
hanging
about
he
and
dolly
would
have
the
furnished
flat
while
his
father
rested
quietly
in
the
country
with
evie
he
could
also
keep
an
eye
on
his
own
little
house
which
was
being
painted
and
decorated
for
him
in
one
of
the
surrey
suburbs
and
in
which
he
hoped
to
install
himself
soon
after
christmas
yes
he
would
go
up
after
lunch
in
his
new
motor
and
the
town
servants
who
had
come
down
for
the
funeral
would
go
up
by
train
he
found
his
father
chauffeur
in
the
garage
said
morning
without
looking
at
the
man
face
and
bending
over
the
car
continued
hullo
my
new
car
been
driven
has
it
sir
yes
said
charles
getting
rather
red
and
driven
it
has
cleaned
it
properly
for
there
mud
on
the
axle
take
it
off
the
man
went
for
the
cloths
without
a
word
he
was
a
chauffeur
as
ugly
as
sin
not
that
this
did
him
disservice
with
charles
who
thought
charm
in
a
man
rather
rot
and
had
soon
got
rid
of
the
little
italian
beast
with
whom
they
had
started
charles
his
bride
was
tripping
after
him
over
the
a
dainty
black
column
her
little
face
and
elaborate
mourning
hat
forming
the
capital
thereof
one
minute
i
busy
well
crane
who
been
driving
it
do
you
suppose
do
know
i
sure
sir
no
one
driven
it
since
i
been
back
but
of
course
there
the
fortnight
been
away
with
the
other
car
in
yorkshire
the
mud
came
off
easily
charles
your
father
down
something
happened
he
wants
you
in
the
house
at
once
oh
charles
wait
dear
wait
a
minute
who
had
the
key
to
the
garage
while
you
were
away
crane
the
gardener
sir
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
old
penny
can
drive
a
motor
no
sir
no
one
had
the
motor
out
sir
then
how
do
you
account
for
the
mud
on
the
axle
i
ca
of
course
say
for
the
time
i
been
in
yorkshire
no
more
mud
now
sir
charles
was
vexed
the
man
was
treating
him
as
a
fool
and
if
his
heart
had
not
been
so
heavy
he
would
have
reported
him
to
his
father
but
it
was
not
a
morning
for
complaints
ordering
the
motor
to
be
round
after
lunch
he
joined
his
wife
who
had
all
the
while
been
pouring
out
some
incoherent
story
about
a
letter
and
a
miss
schlegel
now
dolly
i
can
attend
to
you
miss
schlegel
what
does
she
want
when
people
wrote
a
letter
charles
always
asked
what
they
wanted
want
was
to
him
the
only
cause
of
action
and
the
question
in
this
case
was
correct
for
his
wife
replied
she
wants
howards
end
howards
end
now
crane
just
do
forget
to
put
on
the
stepney
wheel
no
sir
now
mind
you
do
forget
for
i
come
little
woman
when
they
were
out
of
the
chauffeur
sight
he
put
his
arm
around
her
waist
and
pressed
her
against
him
all
his
affection
and
half
his
attention
it
was
what
he
granted
her
throughout
their
happy
married
life
but
you
have
listened
charles
what
wrong
i
keep
on
telling
you
howards
end
miss
schlegels
got
it
got
what
asked
charles
unclasping
her
what
the
dickens
are
you
talking
about
now
charles
you
promised
not
to
say
those
naughty
look
here
i
in
no
mood
for
foolery
it
no
morning
for
it
either
i
tell
you
i
keep
on
telling
you
miss
schlegel
got
it
your
mother
left
it
to
her
and
you
all
got
to
move
out
howards
end
howards
end
she
screamed
mimicking
him
and
as
she
did
so
evie
came
dashing
out
of
the
shrubbery
dolly
go
back
at
once
my
father
much
annoyed
with
you
charles
she
hit
herself
wildly
come
in
at
once
to
father
he
had
a
letter
that
too
awful
charles
began
to
run
but
checked
himself
and
stepped
heavily
across
the
gravel
path
there
the
house
was
the
nine
windows
the
unprolific
vine
he
exclaimed
schlegels
again
and
as
if
to
complete
chaos
dolly
said
oh
no
the
matron
of
the
nursing
home
has
written
instead
of
her
come
in
all
three
of
you
cried
his
father
no
longer
inert
dolly
why
have
you
disobeyed
me
oh
wilcox
i
told
you
not
to
go
out
to
the
garage
i
heard
you
all
shouting
in
the
garden
i
wo
have
it
come
in
he
stood
in
the
porch
transformed
letters
in
his
hand
into
the
every
one
of
you
we
discuss
private
matters
in
the
middle
of
all
the
servants
here
charles
here
read
these
see
what
you
make
charles
took
two
letters
and
read
them
as
he
followed
the
procession
the
first
was
a
covering
note
from
the
matron
wilcox
had
desired
her
when
the
funeral
should
be
over
to
forward
the
enclosed
the
enclosed
it
was
from
his
mother
herself
she
had
written
to
my
husband
i
should
like
miss
schlegel
margaret
to
have
howards
end
i
suppose
we
going
to
have
a
talk
about
this
he
remarked
ominously
calm
certainly
i
was
coming
out
to
you
when
dolly
well
let
sit
down
come
evie
do
waste
time
sit
down
in
silence
they
drew
up
to
the
the
events
of
yesterday
indeed
of
this
morning
suddenly
receded
into
a
past
so
remote
that
they
seemed
scarcely
to
have
lived
in
it
heavy
breathings
were
heard
they
were
calming
themselves
charles
to
steady
them
further
read
the
enclosure
out
loud
a
note
in
my
mother
handwriting
in
an
envelope
addressed
to
my
father
sealed
inside
should
like
miss
schlegel
margaret
to
have
howards
end
no
date
no
signature
forwarded
through
the
matron
of
that
nursing
home
now
the
question
is
dolly
interrupted
him
but
i
say
that
note
legal
houses
ought
to
be
done
by
a
lawyer
charles
surely
her
husband
worked
his
jaw
severely
little
lumps
appeared
in
front
of
either
ear
a
symptom
that
she
had
not
yet
learnt
to
respect
and
she
asked
whether
she
might
see
the
note
charles
looked
at
his
father
for
permission
who
said
abstractedly
give
it
her
she
seized
it
and
at
once
exclaimed
why
it
only
in
pencil
i
said
so
pencil
never
counts
we
know
that
it
is
not
legally
binding
dolly
said
wilcox
speaking
from
out
of
his
fortress
we
are
aware
of
that
legally
i
should
be
justified
in
tearing
it
up
and
throwing
it
into
the
fire
of
course
my
dear
we
consider
you
as
one
of
the
family
but
it
will
be
better
if
you
do
not
interfere
with
what
you
do
not
understand
charles
vexed
both
with
his
father
and
his
wife
then
repeated
the
question
is
he
had
cleared
a
space
of
the
from
plates
and
knives
so
that
he
could
draw
patterns
on
the
tablecloth
the
question
is
whether
miss
schlegel
during
the
fortnight
we
were
all
away
whether
she
unduly
he
stopped
i
do
think
that
said
his
father
whose
nature
was
nobler
than
his
do
think
what
that
she
would
have
that
it
is
a
case
of
undue
influence
no
to
my
mind
the
question
is
the
the
invalid
condition
at
the
time
she
wrote
my
dear
father
consult
an
expert
if
you
like
but
i
do
admit
it
is
my
mother
writing
why
you
just
said
it
was
cried
dolly
never
mind
if
i
did
he
blazed
out
and
hold
your
tongue
the
poor
little
wife
coloured
at
this
and
drawing
her
handkerchief
from
her
pocket
shed
a
few
tears
no
one
noticed
her
evie
was
scowling
like
an
angry
boy
the
two
men
were
gradually
assuming
the
manner
of
the
they
were
both
at
their
best
when
serving
on
committees
they
did
not
make
the
mistake
of
handling
human
affairs
in
the
bulk
but
disposed
of
them
item
by
item
sharply
calligraphy
was
the
item
before
them
now
and
on
it
they
turned
their
brains
charles
after
a
little
demur
accepted
the
writing
as
genuine
and
they
passed
on
to
the
next
point
it
is
the
best
perhaps
the
only
way
of
dodging
emotion
they
were
the
average
human
article
and
had
they
considered
the
note
as
a
whole
it
would
have
driven
them
miserable
or
mad
considered
item
by
item
the
emotional
content
was
minimized
and
all
went
forward
smoothly
the
clock
ticked
the
coals
blazed
higher
and
contended
with
the
white
radiance
that
poured
in
through
the
windows
unnoticed
the
sun
occupied
his
sky
and
the
shadows
of
the
tree
stems
extraordinarily
solid
fell
like
trenches
of
purple
across
the
frosted
lawn
it
was
a
glorious
winter
morning
evie
fox
terrier
who
had
passed
for
white
was
only
a
dirty
grey
dog
now
so
intense
was
the
purity
that
surrounded
him
he
was
discredited
but
the
blackbirds
that
he
was
chasing
glowed
with
arabian
darkness
for
all
the
conventional
colouring
of
life
had
been
altered
inside
the
clock
struck
ten
with
a
rich
and
confident
note
other
clocks
confirmed
it
and
the
discussion
moved
towards
its
close
to
follow
it
is
unnecessary
it
is
rather
a
moment
when
the
commentator
should
step
forward
ought
the
wilcoxes
to
have
offered
their
home
to
margaret
i
think
not
the
appeal
was
too
flimsy
it
was
not
legal
it
had
been
written
in
illness
and
under
the
spell
of
a
sudden
friendship
it
was
contrary
to
the
dead
woman
intentions
in
the
past
contrary
to
her
very
nature
so
far
as
that
nature
was
understood
by
them
to
them
howards
end
was
a
house
they
could
not
know
that
to
her
it
had
been
a
spirit
for
which
she
sought
a
spiritual
heir
and
pushing
one
step
farther
in
these
mists
may
they
not
have
decided
even
better
than
they
supposed
is
it
credible
that
the
possessions
of
the
spirit
can
be
bequeathed
at
all
has
the
soul
offspring
a
tree
a
vine
a
wisp
of
hay
with
dew
on
it
can
passion
for
such
things
be
transmitted
where
there
is
no
bond
of
blood
no
the
wilcoxes
are
not
to
be
blamed
the
problem
is
too
terrific
and
they
could
not
even
perceive
a
problem
no
it
is
natural
and
fitting
that
after
due
debate
they
should
tear
the
note
up
and
throw
it
on
to
their
fire
the
practical
moralist
may
acquit
them
absolutely
he
who
strives
to
look
deeper
may
acquit
them
almost
for
one
hard
fact
remains
they
did
neglect
a
personal
appeal
the
woman
who
had
died
did
say
to
them
do
this
and
they
answered
we
will
not
the
incident
made
a
most
painful
impression
on
them
grief
mounted
into
the
brain
and
worked
there
disquietingly
yesterday
they
had
lamented
she
was
a
dear
mother
a
true
wife
in
our
absence
she
neglected
her
health
and
died
today
they
thought
she
was
not
as
true
as
dear
as
we
supposed
the
desire
for
a
more
inward
light
had
found
expression
at
last
the
unseen
had
impacted
on
the
seen
and
all
that
they
could
say
was
treachery
wilcox
had
been
treacherous
to
the
family
to
the
laws
of
property
to
her
own
written
word
how
did
she
expect
howards
end
to
be
conveyed
to
miss
schlegel
was
her
husband
to
whom
it
legally
belonged
to
make
it
over
to
her
as
a
free
gift
was
the
said
miss
schlegel
to
have
a
life
interest
in
it
or
to
own
it
absolutely
was
there
to
be
no
compensation
for
the
garage
and
other
improvements
that
they
had
made
under
the
assumption
that
all
would
be
theirs
some
day
treacherous
treacherous
and
absurd
when
we
think
the
dead
both
treacherous
and
absurd
we
have
gone
far
towards
reconciling
ourselves
to
their
departure
that
note
scribbled
in
pencil
sent
through
the
matron
was
unbusinesslike
as
well
as
cruel
and
decreased
at
once
the
value
of
the
woman
who
had
written
it
ah
well
said
wilcox
rising
from
the
table
i
should
have
thought
it
possible
mother
could
have
meant
it
said
evie
still
frowning
no
my
girl
of
course
not
mother
believed
so
in
ancestors
too
it
is
like
her
to
leave
anything
to
an
outsider
who
never
the
whole
thing
is
unlike
her
he
announced
if
miss
schlegel
had
been
poor
if
she
had
wanted
a
house
i
could
understand
it
a
little
but
she
has
a
house
of
her
own
why
should
she
want
another
she
would
have
any
use
of
howards
end
that
time
may
prove
murmured
charles
how
asked
his
sister
presumably
she
knows
mother
will
have
told
her
she
got
twice
or
three
times
into
the
nursing
home
presumably
she
is
awaiting
developments
what
a
horrid
woman
and
dolly
who
had
recovered
cried
why
she
may
be
coming
down
to
turn
us
out
now
charles
put
her
right
i
wish
she
would
he
said
ominously
i
could
then
deal
with
her
so
could
i
echoed
his
father
who
was
feeling
rather
in
the
cold
charles
had
been
kind
in
undertaking
the
funeral
arrangements
and
in
telling
him
to
eat
his
breakfast
but
the
boy
as
he
grew
up
was
a
little
dictatorial
and
assumed
the
post
of
chairman
too
readily
i
could
deal
with
her
if
she
comes
but
she
wo
come
you
all
a
bit
hard
on
miss
schlegel
that
paul
business
was
pretty
scandalous
though
i
want
no
more
of
the
paul
business
charles
as
i
said
at
the
time
and
besides
it
is
quite
apart
from
this
business
margaret
schlegel
has
been
officious
and
tiresome
during
this
terrible
week
and
we
have
all
suffered
under
her
but
upon
my
soul
she
honest
she
not
in
collusion
with
the
matron
i
absolutely
certain
of
it
nor
was
she
with
the
doctor
i
equally
certain
of
that
she
did
not
hide
anything
from
us
for
up
to
that
very
afternoon
she
was
as
ignorant
as
we
are
she
like
ourselves
was
a
dupe
he
stopped
for
a
moment
you
see
charles
in
her
terrible
pain
your
poor
mother
put
us
all
in
false
positions
paul
would
not
have
left
england
you
would
not
have
gone
to
italy
nor
evie
and
i
into
yorkshire
if
only
we
had
known
well
miss
schlegel
position
has
been
equally
false
take
all
in
all
she
has
not
come
out
of
it
badly
evie
said
but
those
chrysanthemums
or
coming
down
to
the
funeral
at
all
echoed
dolly
why
should
she
come
down
she
had
the
right
to
and
she
stood
far
back
among
the
hilton
women
the
flowers
certainly
we
should
not
have
sent
such
flowers
but
they
may
have
seemed
the
right
thing
to
her
evie
and
for
all
you
know
they
may
be
the
custom
in
oh
i
forget
she
is
really
english
cried
evie
that
would
explain
a
lot
she
a
cosmopolitan
said
charles
looking
at
his
watch
i
admit
i
rather
down
on
cosmopolitans
my
fault
doubtless
i
can
not
stand
them
and
a
german
cosmopolitan
is
the
limit
i
think
that
about
all
it
i
want
to
run
down
and
see
chalkeley
a
bicycle
will
do
and
by
the
way
i
wish
you
speak
to
crane
some
time
i
certain
he
had
my
new
car
out
has
he
done
it
any
harm
no
in
that
case
i
shall
let
it
pass
it
not
worth
while
having
a
row
charles
and
his
father
sometimes
disagreed
but
they
always
parted
with
an
increased
regard
for
one
another
and
each
desired
no
doughtier
comrade
when
it
was
necessary
to
voyage
for
a
little
past
the
emotions
so
the
sailors
of
ulysses
voyaged
past
the
sirens
having
first
stopped
one
another
ears
with
wool
chapter
charles
need
not
have
been
anxious
miss
schlegel
had
never
heard
of
his
mother
strange
request
she
was
to
hear
of
it
in
after
years
when
she
had
built
up
her
life
differently
and
it
was
to
fit
into
position
as
the
headstone
of
the
corner
her
mind
was
bent
on
other
questions
now
and
by
her
also
it
would
have
been
rejected
as
the
fantasy
of
an
invalid
she
was
parting
from
these
wilcoxes
for
the
second
time
paul
and
his
mother
ripple
and
great
wave
had
flowed
into
her
life
and
ebbed
out
of
it
for
ever
the
ripple
had
left
no
traces
behind
the
wave
had
strewn
at
her
feet
fragments
torn
from
the
unknown
a
curious
seeker
she
stood
for
a
while
at
the
verge
of
the
sea
that
tells
so
little
but
tells
a
little
and
watched
the
outgoing
of
this
last
tremendous
tide
her
friend
had
vanished
in
agony
but
not
she
believed
in
degradation
her
withdrawal
had
hinted
at
other
things
besides
disease
and
pain
some
leave
our
life
with
tears
others
with
an
insane
frigidity
wilcox
had
taken
the
middle
course
which
only
rarer
natures
can
pursue
she
had
kept
proportion
she
had
told
a
little
of
her
grim
secret
to
her
friends
but
not
too
much
she
had
shut
up
her
heart
almost
but
not
entirely
it
is
thus
if
there
is
any
rule
that
we
ought
to
die
neither
as
victim
nor
as
fanatic
but
as
the
seafarer
who
can
greet
with
an
equal
eye
the
deep
that
he
is
entering
and
the
shore
that
he
must
leave
the
last
word
whatever
it
would
be
had
certainly
not
been
said
in
hilton
churchyard
she
had
not
died
there
a
funeral
is
not
death
any
more
than
baptism
is
birth
or
marriage
union
all
three
are
the
clumsy
devices
coming
now
too
late
now
too
early
by
which
society
would
register
the
quick
motions
of
man
in
margaret
eyes
wilcox
had
escaped
registration
she
had
gone
out
of
life
vividly
her
own
way
and
no
dust
was
so
truly
dust
as
the
contents
of
that
heavy
coffin
lowered
with
ceremonial
until
it
rested
on
the
dust
of
the
earth
no
flowers
so
utterly
wasted
as
the
chrysanthemums
that
the
frost
must
have
withered
before
morning
margaret
had
once
said
she
loved
superstition
it
was
not
true
few
women
had
tried
more
earnestly
to
pierce
the
accretions
in
which
body
and
soul
are
enwrapped
the
death
of
wilcox
had
helped
her
in
her
work
she
saw
a
little
more
clearly
than
hitherto
what
a
human
being
is
and
to
what
he
may
aspire
truer
relationships
gleamed
perhaps
the
last
word
would
be
hope
hope
even
on
this
side
of
the
grave
meanwhile
she
could
take
an
interest
in
the
survivors
in
spite
of
her
christmas
duties
in
spite
of
her
brother
the
wilcoxes
continued
to
play
a
considerable
part
in
her
thoughts
she
had
seen
so
much
of
them
in
the
final
week
they
were
not
her
sort
they
were
often
suspicious
and
stupid
and
deficient
where
she
excelled
but
collision
with
them
stimulated
her
and
she
felt
an
interest
that
verged
into
liking
even
for
charles
she
desired
to
protect
them
and
often
felt
that
they
could
protect
her
excelling
where
she
was
deficient
once
past
the
rocks
of
emotion
they
knew
so
well
what
to
do
whom
to
send
for
their
hands
were
on
all
the
ropes
they
had
grit
as
well
as
grittiness
and
she
valued
grit
enormously
they
led
a
life
that
she
could
not
attain
to
the
outer
life
of
telegrams
and
anger
which
had
detonated
when
helen
and
paul
had
touched
in
june
and
had
detonated
again
the
other
week
to
margaret
this
life
was
to
remain
a
real
force
she
could
not
despise
it
as
helen
and
tibby
affected
to
do
it
fostered
such
virtues
as
neatness
decision
and
obedience
virtues
of
the
second
rank
no
doubt
but
they
have
formed
our
civilization
they
form
character
too
margaret
could
not
doubt
it
they
keep
the
soul
from
becoming
sloppy
how
dare
schlegels
despise
wilcoxes
when
it
takes
all
sorts
to
make
a
world
do
brood
too
much
she
wrote
to
helen
on
the
superiority
of
the
unseen
to
the
seen
it
true
but
to
brood
on
it
is
mediaeval
our
business
is
not
to
contrast
the
two
but
to
reconcile
them
helen
replied
that
she
had
no
intention
of
brooding
on
such
a
dull
subject
what
did
her
sister
take
her
for
the
weather
was
magnificent
she
and
the
mosebachs
had
gone
tobogganing
on
the
only
hill
that
pomerania
boasted
it
was
fun
but
overcrowded
for
the
rest
of
pomerania
had
gone
there
too
helen
loved
the
country
and
her
letter
glowed
with
physical
exercise
and
poetry
she
spoke
of
the
scenery
quiet
yet
august
of
the
fields
with
their
scampering
herds
of
deer
of
the
river
and
its
quaint
entrance
into
the
baltic
sea
of
the
oderberge
only
three
hundred
feet
high
from
which
one
slid
all
too
quickly
back
into
the
pomeranian
plains
and
yet
these
oderberge
were
real
mountains
with
streams
and
views
complete
it
is
size
that
counts
so
much
as
the
way
things
are
arranged
in
another
paragraph
she
referred
to
wilcox
sympathetically
but
the
news
had
not
bitten
into
her
she
had
not
realized
the
accessories
of
death
which
are
in
a
sense
more
memorable
than
death
itself
the
atmosphere
of
precautions
and
recriminations
and
in
the
midst
a
human
body
growing
more
vivid
because
it
was
in
pain
the
end
of
that
body
in
hilton
churchyard
the
survival
of
something
that
suggested
hope
vivid
in
its
turn
against
life
workaday
cheerfulness
all
these
were
lost
to
helen
who
only
felt
that
a
pleasant
lady
could
now
be
pleasant
no
longer
she
returned
to
wickham
place
full
of
her
own
affairs
she
had
had
another
proposal
and
margaret
after
a
moment
hesitation
was
content
that
this
should
be
so
the
proposal
had
not
been
a
serious
matter
it
was
the
work
of
fraulein
mosebach
who
had
conceived
the
large
and
patriotic
notion
of
winning
back
her
cousins
to
the
fatherland
by
matrimony
england
had
played
paul
wilcox
and
lost
germany
played
herr
forstmeister
someone
helen
could
not
remember
his
name
herr
forstmeister
lived
in
a
wood
and
standing
on
the
summit
of
the
oderberge
he
had
pointed
out
his
house
to
helen
or
rather
had
pointed
out
the
wedge
of
pines
in
which
it
lay
she
had
exclaimed
oh
how
lovely
the
place
for
me
and
in
the
evening
frieda
appeared
in
her
bedroom
i
have
a
message
dear
helen
and
so
she
had
but
had
been
very
nice
when
helen
laughed
quite
understood
a
forest
too
solitary
and
damp
quite
agreed
but
herr
forstmeister
believed
he
had
assurance
to
the
contrary
germany
had
lost
but
with
holding
the
manhood
of
the
world
she
felt
bound
to
win
and
there
will
even
be
someone
for
tibby
concluded
helen
there
now
tibby
think
of
that
frieda
is
saving
up
a
little
girl
for
you
in
and
white
worsted
stockings
but
the
feet
of
the
stockings
are
pink
as
if
the
little
girl
had
trodden
in
strawberries
i
talked
too
much
my
head
aches
now
you
talk
tibby
consented
to
talk
he
too
was
full
of
his
own
affairs
for
he
had
just
been
up
to
try
for
a
scholarship
at
oxford
the
men
were
down
and
the
candidates
had
been
housed
in
various
colleges
and
had
dined
in
hall
tibby
was
sensitive
to
beauty
the
experience
was
new
and
he
gave
a
description
of
his
visit
that
was
almost
glowing
the
august
and
mellow
university
soaked
with
the
richness
of
the
western
counties
that
it
has
served
for
a
thousand
years
appealed
at
once
to
the
boy
taste
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
he
could
understand
and
he
understood
it
all
the
better
because
it
was
empty
oxford
is
oxford
not
a
mere
receptacle
for
youth
like
cambridge
perhaps
it
wants
its
inmates
to
love
it
rather
than
to
love
one
another
such
at
all
events
was
to
be
its
effect
on
tibby
his
sisters
sent
him
there
that
he
might
make
friends
for
they
knew
that
his
education
had
been
cranky
and
had
severed
him
from
other
boys
and
men
he
made
no
friends
his
oxford
remained
oxford
empty
and
he
took
into
life
with
him
not
the
memory
of
a
radiance
but
the
memory
of
a
colour
scheme
it
pleased
margaret
to
hear
her
brother
and
sister
talking
they
did
not
get
on
overwell
as
a
rule
for
a
few
moments
she
listened
to
them
feeling
elderly
and
benign
then
something
occurred
to
her
and
she
interrupted
helen
i
told
you
about
poor
wilcox
that
sad
business
yes
i
have
had
a
correspondence
with
her
son
he
was
winding
up
the
estate
and
wrote
to
ask
me
whether
his
mother
had
wanted
me
to
have
anything
i
thought
it
good
of
him
considering
i
knew
her
so
little
i
said
that
she
had
once
spoken
of
giving
me
a
christmas
present
but
we
both
forgot
about
it
afterwards
i
hope
charles
took
the
hint
yes
that
is
to
say
her
husband
wrote
later
on
and
thanked
me
for
being
a
little
kind
to
her
and
actually
gave
me
her
silver
vinaigrette
do
you
think
that
is
extraordinarily
generous
it
has
made
me
like
him
very
much
he
hopes
that
this
will
not
be
the
end
of
our
acquaintance
but
that
you
and
i
will
go
and
stop
with
evie
some
time
in
the
future
i
like
wilcox
he
is
taking
up
his
work
rubber
it
is
a
big
business
i
gather
he
is
launching
out
rather
charles
is
in
it
too
charles
is
married
a
pretty
little
creature
but
she
does
seem
wise
they
took
on
the
flat
but
now
they
have
gone
off
to
a
house
of
their
own
helen
after
a
decent
pause
continued
her
account
of
stettin
how
quickly
a
situation
changes
in
june
she
had
been
in
a
crisis
even
in
november
she
could
blush
and
be
unnatural
now
it
was
january
and
the
whole
affair
lay
forgotten
looking
back
on
the
past
six
months
margaret
realized
the
chaotic
nature
of
our
daily
life
and
its
difference
from
the
orderly
sequence
that
has
been
fabricated
by
historians
actual
life
is
full
of
false
clues
and
that
lead
nowhere
with
infinite
effort
we
nerve
ourselves
for
a
crisis
that
never
comes
the
most
successful
career
must
show
a
waste
of
strength
that
might
have
removed
mountains
and
the
most
unsuccessful
is
not
that
of
the
man
who
is
taken
unprepared
but
of
him
who
has
prepared
and
is
never
taken
on
a
tragedy
of
that
kind
our
national
morality
is
duly
silent
it
assumes
that
preparation
against
danger
is
in
itself
a
good
and
that
men
like
nations
are
the
better
for
staggering
through
life
fully
armed
the
tragedy
of
preparedness
has
scarcely
been
handled
save
by
the
greeks
life
is
indeed
dangerous
but
not
in
the
way
morality
would
have
us
believe
it
is
indeed
unmanageable
but
the
essence
of
it
is
not
a
battle
it
is
unmanageable
because
it
is
a
romance
and
its
essence
is
romantic
beauty
margaret
hoped
that
for
the
future
she
would
be
less
cautious
not
more
cautious
than
she
had
been
in
the
past
chapter
over
two
years
passed
and
the
schlegel
household
continued
to
lead
its
life
of
cultured
but
not
ignoble
ease
still
swimming
gracefully
on
the
grey
tides
of
london
concerts
and
plays
swept
past
them
money
had
been
spent
and
renewed
reputations
won
and
lost
and
the
city
herself
emblematic
of
their
lives
rose
and
fell
in
a
continual
flux
while
her
shallows
washed
more
widely
against
the
hills
of
surrey
and
over
the
fields
of
hertfordshire
this
famous
building
had
arisen
that
was
doomed
today
whitehall
had
been
transformed
it
would
be
the
turn
of
regent
street
tomorrow
and
month
by
month
the
roads
smelt
more
strongly
of
petrol
and
were
more
difficult
to
cross
and
human
beings
heard
each
other
speak
with
greater
difficulty
breathed
less
of
the
air
and
saw
less
of
the
sky
nature
withdrew
the
leaves
were
falling
by
midsummer
the
sun
shone
through
dirt
with
an
admired
obscurity
to
speak
against
london
is
no
longer
fashionable
the
earth
as
an
artistic
cult
has
had
its
day
and
the
literature
of
the
near
future
will
probably
ignore
the
country
and
seek
inspiration
from
the
town
one
can
understand
the
reaction
of
pan
and
the
elemental
forces
the
public
has
heard
a
little
too
much
they
seem
victorian
while
london
is
georgian
and
those
who
care
for
the
earth
with
sincerity
may
wait
long
ere
the
pendulum
swings
back
to
her
again
certainly
london
fascinates
one
visualizes
it
as
a
tract
of
quivering
grey
intelligent
without
purpose
and
excitable
without
love
as
a
spirit
that
has
altered
before
it
can
be
chronicled
as
a
heart
that
certainly
beats
but
with
no
pulsation
of
humanity
it
lies
beyond
everything
nature
with
all
her
cruelty
comes
nearer
to
us
than
do
these
crowds
of
men
a
friend
explains
himself
the
earth
is
explicable
from
her
we
came
and
we
must
return
to
her
but
who
can
explain
westminster
bridge
road
or
liverpool
street
in
the
morning
the
city
inhaling
or
the
same
thoroughfares
in
the
evening
the
city
exhaling
her
exhausted
air
we
reach
in
desperation
beyond
the
fog
beyond
the
very
stars
the
voids
of
the
universe
are
ransacked
to
justify
the
monster
and
stamped
with
a
human
face
london
is
religion
opportunity
not
the
decorous
religion
of
theologians
but
anthropomorphic
crude
yes
the
continuous
flow
would
be
tolerable
if
a
man
of
our
own
sort
not
anyone
pompous
or
tearful
were
caring
for
us
up
in
the
sky
the
londoner
seldom
understands
his
city
until
it
sweeps
him
too
away
from
his
moorings
and
margaret
eyes
were
not
opened
until
the
lease
of
wickham
place
expired
she
had
always
known
that
it
must
expire
but
the
knowledge
only
became
vivid
about
nine
months
before
the
event
then
the
house
was
suddenly
ringed
with
pathos
it
had
seen
so
much
happiness
why
had
it
to
be
swept
away
in
the
streets
of
the
city
she
noted
for
the
first
time
the
architecture
of
hurry
and
heard
the
language
of
hurry
on
the
mouths
of
its
inhabitants
clipped
words
formless
sentences
potted
expressions
of
approval
or
disgust
month
by
month
things
were
stepping
livelier
but
to
what
goal
the
population
still
rose
but
what
was
the
quality
of
the
men
born
the
particular
millionaire
who
owned
the
freehold
of
wickham
place
and
desired
to
erect
babylonian
flats
upon
it
what
right
had
he
to
stir
so
large
a
portion
of
the
quivering
jelly
he
was
not
a
fool
she
had
heard
him
expose
socialism
but
true
insight
began
just
where
his
intelligence
ended
and
one
gathered
that
this
was
the
case
with
most
millionaires
what
right
had
such
men
but
margaret
checked
herself
that
way
lies
madness
thank
goodness
she
too
had
some
money
and
could
purchase
a
new
home
tibby
now
in
his
second
year
at
oxford
was
down
for
the
easter
vacation
and
margaret
took
the
opportunity
of
having
a
serious
talk
with
him
did
he
at
all
know
where
he
wanted
to
live
tibby
did
know
that
he
did
know
did
he
at
all
know
what
he
wanted
to
do
he
was
equally
uncertain
but
when
pressed
remarked
that
he
should
prefer
to
be
quite
free
of
any
profession
margaret
was
not
shocked
but
went
on
sewing
for
a
few
minutes
before
she
replied
i
was
thinking
of
vyse
he
never
strikes
me
as
particularly
happy
said
tibby
and
then
held
his
mouth
open
in
a
curious
quiver
as
if
he
too
had
thoughts
of
vyse
had
seen
round
through
over
and
beyond
vyse
had
weighed
vyse
grouped
him
and
finally
dismissed
him
as
having
no
possible
bearing
on
the
subject
under
discussion
that
bleat
of
tibby
infuriated
helen
but
helen
was
now
down
in
the
preparing
a
speech
about
political
economy
at
times
her
voice
could
be
heard
declaiming
through
the
floor
but
vyse
is
rather
a
wretched
weedy
man
do
you
think
then
there
guy
that
was
a
pitiful
business
besides
shifting
to
the
general
every
one
is
the
better
for
some
regular
work
groans
i
shall
stick
to
it
she
continued
smiling
i
am
not
saying
it
to
educate
you
it
is
what
i
really
think
i
believe
that
in
the
last
century
men
have
developed
the
desire
for
work
and
they
must
not
starve
it
it
a
new
desire
it
goes
with
a
great
deal
that
bad
but
in
itself
it
good
and
i
hope
that
for
women
too
to
will
soon
become
as
shocking
as
to
be
married
was
a
hundred
years
ago
i
have
no
experience
of
this
profound
desire
to
which
you
allude
enunciated
tibby
then
we
leave
the
subject
till
you
do
i
not
going
to
rattle
you
round
take
your
time
only
do
think
over
the
lives
of
the
men
you
like
most
and
see
how
arranged
them
i
like
guy
and
vyse
most
said
tibby
faintly
and
leant
so
far
back
in
his
chair
that
he
extended
in
a
horizontal
line
from
knees
to
throat
and
do
think
i
not
serious
because
i
do
use
the
traditional
arguments
making
money
a
sphere
awaiting
you
and
so
on
all
of
which
are
for
various
reasons
cant
she
sewed
on
i
only
your
sister
i
have
any
authority
over
you
and
i
do
want
to
have
any
just
to
put
before
you
what
i
think
the
truth
you
see
she
shook
off
the
to
which
she
had
recently
taken
in
a
few
years
we
shall
be
the
same
age
practically
and
i
shall
want
you
to
help
me
men
are
so
much
nicer
than
women
labouring
under
such
a
delusion
why
do
you
not
marry
i
sometimes
jolly
well
think
i
would
if
i
got
the
chance
has
nobody
arst
you
only
ninnies
do
people
ask
helen
plentifully
tell
me
about
them
no
tell
me
about
your
ninnies
then
they
were
men
who
had
nothing
better
to
do
said
his
sister
feeling
that
she
was
entitled
to
score
this
point
so
take
warning
you
must
work
or
else
you
must
pretend
to
work
which
is
what
i
do
work
work
work
if
you
save
your
soul
and
your
body
it
is
honestly
a
necessity
dear
boy
look
at
the
wilcoxes
look
at
pembroke
with
all
their
defects
of
temper
and
understanding
such
men
give
me
more
pleasure
than
many
who
are
better
equipped
and
i
think
it
is
because
they
have
worked
regularly
and
honestly
spare
me
the
wilcoxes
he
moaned
i
shall
not
they
are
the
right
sort
oh
goodness
me
meg
he
protested
suddenly
sitting
up
alert
and
angry
tibby
for
all
his
defects
had
a
genuine
personality
well
they
as
near
the
right
sort
as
you
can
imagine
no
no
oh
no
i
was
thinking
of
the
younger
son
whom
i
once
classed
as
a
ninny
but
who
came
back
so
ill
from
nigeria
gone
out
there
again
evie
wilcox
tells
me
out
to
his
duty
duty
always
elicited
a
groan
he
does
want
the
money
it
is
work
he
wants
though
it
is
beastly
work
dull
country
dishonest
natives
an
eternal
fidget
over
fresh
water
and
food
a
nation
who
can
produce
men
of
that
sort
may
well
be
proud
no
wonder
england
has
become
an
empire
empire
i
ca
bother
over
results
said
margaret
a
little
sadly
they
are
too
difficult
for
me
i
can
only
look
at
the
men
an
empire
bores
me
so
far
but
i
can
appreciate
the
heroism
that
builds
it
up
london
bores
me
but
what
thousands
of
splendid
people
are
labouring
to
make
london
what
it
is
he
sneered
what
it
is
worse
luck
i
want
activity
without
civilization
how
paradoxical
yet
i
expect
that
is
what
we
shall
find
in
heaven
and
i
said
tibby
want
civilization
without
activity
which
i
expect
is
what
we
shall
find
in
the
other
place
you
need
go
as
far
as
the
other
place
if
you
want
that
you
can
find
it
at
oxford
stupid
if
i
stupid
get
me
back
to
the
even
live
in
oxford
if
you
like
north
oxford
i
live
anywhere
except
bournemouth
torquay
and
cheltenham
oh
yes
or
ilfracombe
and
swanage
and
tunbridge
wells
and
surbiton
and
bedford
there
on
no
account
london
then
i
agree
but
helen
rather
wants
to
get
away
from
london
however
there
no
reason
we
should
have
a
house
in
the
country
and
also
a
flat
in
town
provided
we
all
stick
together
and
contribute
though
of
course
oh
how
one
does
maunder
on
and
to
think
to
think
of
the
people
who
are
really
poor
how
do
they
live
not
to
move
about
the
world
would
kill
me
as
she
spoke
the
door
was
flung
open
and
helen
burst
in
in
a
state
of
extreme
excitement
oh
my
dears
what
do
you
think
you
never
guess
a
woman
been
here
asking
me
for
her
husband
her
what
helen
was
fond
of
supplying
her
own
surprise
yes
for
her
husband
and
it
really
is
so
not
anything
to
do
with
bracknell
cried
margaret
who
had
lately
taken
on
an
unemployed
of
that
name
to
clean
the
knives
and
boots
i
offered
bracknell
and
he
was
rejected
so
was
tibby
cheer
up
tibby
it
no
one
we
know
i
said
my
good
woman
have
a
good
look
round
hunt
under
the
tables
poke
up
the
chimney
shake
out
the
antimacassars
husband
husband
oh
and
she
so
magnificently
dressed
and
tinkling
like
a
chandelier
now
helen
what
did
happen
really
what
i
say
i
was
as
it
were
orating
my
speech
annie
opens
the
door
like
a
fool
and
shows
a
female
straight
in
on
me
with
my
mouth
open
then
we
began
very
civilly
want
my
husband
what
i
have
reason
to
believe
is
here
no
how
unjust
one
is
she
said
not
she
got
it
perfectly
so
i
said
please
and
she
said
miss
and
there
we
were
lan
lan
or
len
we
were
not
nice
about
our
vowels
lanoline
but
what
an
extraordinary
i
said
good
lanoline
we
have
some
grave
misunderstanding
here
beautiful
as
i
am
my
modesty
is
even
more
remarkable
than
my
beauty
and
never
never
has
lanoline
rested
his
eyes
on
mine
i
hope
you
were
pleased
said
tibby
of
course
helen
squeaked
a
perfectly
delightful
experience
oh
lanoline
a
dear
she
asked
for
a
husband
as
if
he
was
an
umbrella
she
mislaid
him
saturday
afternoon
and
for
a
long
time
suffered
no
inconvenience
but
all
night
and
all
this
morning
her
apprehensions
grew
breakfast
did
seem
the
same
no
no
more
did
lunch
and
so
she
strolled
up
to
wickham
place
as
being
the
most
likely
place
for
the
missing
article
but
how
on
earth
do
begin
how
on
earthing
know
what
i
know
she
kept
repeating
not
uncivilly
but
with
extreme
gloom
in
vain
i
asked
her
what
she
did
know
some
knew
what
others
knew
and
others
did
and
if
they
did
then
others
again
had
better
be
careful
oh
dear
she
was
incompetent
she
had
a
face
like
a
silkworm
and
the
reeks
of
we
chatted
pleasantly
a
little
about
husbands
and
i
wondered
where
hers
was
too
and
advised
her
to
go
to
the
police
she
thanked
me
we
agreed
that
a
notty
notty
man
and
has
no
business
to
go
on
the
but
i
think
she
suspected
me
up
to
the
last
bags
i
writing
to
aunt
juley
about
this
now
meg
remember
bags
i
bag
it
by
all
means
murmured
margaret
putting
down
her
work
i
not
sure
that
this
is
so
funny
helen
it
means
some
horrible
volcano
smoking
somewhere
does
it
i
do
think
so
she
does
really
mind
the
admirable
creature
is
capable
of
tragedy
her
husband
may
be
though
said
margaret
moving
to
the
window
oh
no
not
likely
no
one
capable
of
tragedy
could
have
married
mrs
lanoline
was
she
pretty
her
figure
may
have
been
good
once
the
flats
their
only
outlook
hung
like
an
ornate
curtain
between
margaret
and
the
welter
of
london
her
thoughts
turned
sadly
to
wickham
place
had
been
so
safe
she
feared
fantastically
that
her
own
little
flock
might
be
moving
into
turmoil
and
squalor
into
nearer
contact
with
such
episodes
as
these
tibby
and
i
have
again
been
wondering
where
we
live
next
september
she
said
at
last
tibby
had
better
first
wonder
what
he
do
retorted
helen
and
that
topic
was
resumed
but
with
acrimony
then
tea
came
and
after
tea
helen
went
on
preparing
her
speech
and
margaret
prepared
one
too
for
they
were
going
out
to
a
discussion
society
on
the
morrow
but
her
thoughts
were
poisoned
lanoline
had
risen
out
of
the
abyss
like
a
faint
smell
a
goblin
football
telling
of
a
life
where
love
and
hatred
had
both
decayed
chapter
the
mystery
like
so
many
mysteries
was
explained
next
day
just
as
they
were
dressed
to
go
out
to
dinner
a
bast
called
he
was
a
clerk
in
the
employment
of
the
porphyrion
fire
insurance
company
thus
much
from
his
card
he
had
come
about
the
lady
yesterday
thus
much
from
annie
who
had
shown
him
into
the
cheers
children
cried
helen
it
mrs
lanoline
tibby
was
interested
the
three
hurried
downstairs
to
find
not
the
gay
dog
they
expected
but
a
young
man
colourless
toneless
who
had
already
the
mournful
eyes
above
a
drooping
moustache
that
are
so
common
in
london
and
that
haunt
some
streets
of
the
city
like
accusing
presences
one
guessed
him
as
the
third
generation
grandson
to
the
shepherd
or
ploughboy
whom
civilization
had
sucked
into
the
town
as
one
of
the
thousands
who
have
lost
the
life
of
the
body
and
failed
to
reach
the
life
of
the
spirit
hints
of
robustness
survived
in
him
more
than
a
hint
of
primitive
good
looks
and
margaret
noting
the
spine
that
might
have
been
straight
and
the
chest
that
might
have
broadened
wondered
whether
it
paid
to
give
up
the
glory
of
the
animal
for
a
tail
coat
and
a
couple
of
ideas
culture
had
worked
in
her
own
case
but
during
the
last
few
weeks
she
had
doubted
whether
it
humanized
the
majority
so
wide
and
so
widening
is
the
gulf
that
stretches
between
the
natural
and
the
philosophic
man
so
many
the
good
chaps
who
are
wrecked
in
trying
to
cross
it
she
knew
this
type
very
well
the
vague
aspirations
the
mental
dishonesty
the
familiarity
with
the
outsides
of
books
she
knew
the
very
tones
in
which
he
would
address
her
she
was
only
unprepared
for
an
example
of
her
own
you
would
remember
giving
me
this
miss
schlegel
said
he
uneasily
familiar
no
i
ca
say
i
do
well
that
was
how
it
happened
you
see
where
did
we
meet
bast
for
the
minute
i
do
remember
it
was
a
concert
at
the
queen
hall
i
think
you
will
recollect
he
added
pretentiously
when
i
tell
you
that
it
included
a
performance
of
the
fifth
symphony
of
beethoven
we
hear
the
fifth
practically
every
time
it
done
so
i
not
sure
do
you
remember
helen
was
it
the
time
the
sandy
cat
walked
round
the
balustrade
he
thought
not
then
i
do
remember
that
the
only
beethoven
i
ever
remember
specially
and
you
if
i
may
say
so
took
away
my
umbrella
inadvertently
of
course
likely
enough
helen
laughed
for
i
steal
umbrellas
even
oftener
than
i
hear
beethoven
did
you
get
it
back
yes
thank
you
miss
schlegel
the
mistake
arose
out
of
my
card
did
it
interposed
margaret
yes
the
mistake
arose
it
was
a
mistake
the
lady
who
called
here
yesterday
thought
that
you
were
calling
too
and
that
she
could
find
you
she
continued
pushing
him
forward
for
though
he
had
promised
an
explanation
he
seemed
unable
to
give
one
that
so
calling
too
a
mistake
then
why
began
helen
but
margaret
laid
a
hand
on
her
arm
i
said
to
my
wife
he
continued
more
rapidly
i
said
to
bast
have
to
pay
a
call
on
some
friends
and
bast
said
to
me
go
while
i
was
gone
however
she
wanted
me
on
important
business
and
thought
i
had
come
here
owing
to
the
card
and
so
came
after
me
and
i
beg
to
tender
my
apologies
and
hers
as
well
for
any
inconvenience
we
may
have
inadvertently
caused
you
no
inconvenience
said
helen
but
i
still
do
understand
an
air
of
evasion
characterized
bast
he
explained
again
but
was
obviously
lying
and
helen
did
see
why
he
should
get
off
she
had
the
cruelty
of
youth
neglecting
her
sister
pressure
she
said
i
still
do
understand
when
did
you
say
you
paid
this
call
call
what
call
said
he
staring
as
if
her
question
had
been
a
foolish
one
a
favourite
device
of
those
in
this
afternoon
call
in
the
afternoon
of
course
he
replied
and
looked
at
tibby
to
see
how
the
repartee
went
but
tibby
himself
a
repartee
was
unsympathetic
and
said
saturday
afternoon
or
sunday
afternoon
really
said
helen
and
you
were
still
calling
on
sunday
when
your
wife
came
here
a
long
visit
i
do
call
that
fair
said
bast
going
scarlet
and
handsome
there
was
fight
in
his
eyes
i
know
what
you
mean
and
it
is
so
oh
do
let
us
mind
said
margaret
distressed
again
by
odours
from
the
abyss
it
was
something
else
he
asserted
his
elaborate
manner
breaking
down
i
was
somewhere
else
to
what
you
think
so
there
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
and
explain
she
said
the
rest
is
naturally
no
concern
of
ours
yes
but
i
want
i
wanted
have
you
ever
read
the
ordeal
of
richard
feverel
margaret
nodded
it
a
beautiful
book
i
wanted
to
get
back
to
the
earth
do
you
see
like
richard
does
in
the
end
or
have
you
ever
read
stevenson
prince
otto
helen
and
tibby
groaned
gently
that
another
beautiful
book
you
get
back
to
the
earth
in
that
i
wanted
he
mouthed
affectedly
then
through
the
mists
of
his
culture
came
a
hard
fact
hard
as
a
pebble
i
walked
all
the
saturday
night
said
leonard
i
walked
a
thrill
of
approval
ran
through
the
sisters
but
culture
closed
in
again
he
asked
whether
they
had
ever
read
lucas
open
road
said
helen
no
doubt
it
another
beautiful
book
but
i
rather
hear
about
your
road
oh
i
walked
how
far
i
do
know
nor
for
how
long
it
got
too
dark
to
see
my
watch
were
you
walking
alone
may
i
ask
yes
he
said
straightening
himself
but
we
been
talking
it
over
at
the
office
there
been
a
lot
of
talk
at
the
office
lately
about
these
things
the
fellows
there
said
one
steers
by
the
pole
star
and
i
looked
it
up
in
the
celestial
atlas
but
once
out
of
doors
everything
gets
so
mixed
do
talk
to
me
about
the
pole
star
interrupted
helen
who
was
becoming
interested
i
know
its
little
ways
it
goes
round
and
round
and
you
go
round
after
it
well
i
lost
it
entirely
first
of
all
the
street
lamps
then
the
trees
and
towards
morning
it
got
cloudy
tibby
who
preferred
his
comedy
undiluted
slipped
from
the
room
he
knew
that
this
fellow
would
never
attain
to
poetry
and
did
not
want
to
hear
him
trying
margaret
and
helen
remained
their
brother
influenced
them
more
than
they
knew
in
his
absence
they
were
stirred
to
enthusiasm
more
easily
where
did
you
start
from
cried
margaret
do
tell
us
more
i
took
the
underground
to
wimbledon
as
i
came
out
of
the
office
i
said
to
myself
must
have
a
walk
once
in
a
way
if
i
do
take
this
walk
now
i
shall
never
take
it
i
had
a
bit
of
dinner
at
wimbledon
and
then
but
not
good
country
there
is
it
it
was
for
hours
still
i
had
all
the
night
and
being
out
was
the
great
thing
i
did
get
into
woods
too
presently
yes
go
on
said
helen
you
no
idea
how
difficult
uneven
ground
is
when
dark
did
you
actually
go
off
the
roads
oh
yes
i
always
meant
to
go
off
the
roads
but
the
worst
of
it
is
that
it
more
difficult
to
find
one
way
bast
you
a
born
adventurer
laughed
margaret
no
professional
athlete
would
have
attempted
what
done
it
a
wonder
your
walk
did
end
in
a
broken
neck
whatever
did
your
wife
say
professional
athletes
never
move
without
lanterns
and
compasses
said
helen
besides
they
ca
walk
it
tires
them
go
on
i
felt
like
you
probably
remember
how
in
virginibus
yes
but
the
wood
this
wood
how
did
you
get
out
of
it
i
managed
one
wood
and
found
a
road
the
other
side
which
went
a
good
bit
uphill
i
rather
fancy
it
was
those
north
downs
for
the
road
went
off
into
grass
and
i
got
into
another
wood
that
was
awful
with
gorse
bushes
i
did
wish
i
never
come
but
suddenly
it
got
light
just
while
i
seemed
going
under
one
tree
then
i
found
a
road
down
to
a
station
and
took
the
first
train
i
could
back
to
london
but
was
the
dawn
wonderful
asked
helen
with
unforgettable
sincerity
he
replied
no
the
word
flew
again
like
a
pebble
from
the
sling
down
toppled
all
that
had
seemed
ignoble
or
literary
in
his
talk
down
toppled
tiresome
and
the
love
of
the
earth
and
his
silk
in
the
presence
of
these
women
leonard
had
arrived
and
he
spoke
with
a
flow
an
exultation
that
he
had
seldom
known
the
dawn
was
only
grey
it
was
nothing
to
mention
just
a
grey
evening
turned
upside
down
i
know
and
i
was
too
tired
to
lift
up
my
head
to
look
at
it
and
so
cold
too
i
glad
i
did
it
and
yet
at
the
time
it
bored
me
more
than
i
can
say
and
besides
you
can
believe
me
or
not
as
you
choose
i
was
very
hungry
that
dinner
at
wimbledon
i
meant
it
to
last
me
all
night
like
other
dinners
i
never
thought
that
walking
would
make
such
a
difference
why
when
you
walking
you
want
as
it
were
a
breakfast
and
luncheon
and
tea
during
the
night
as
well
and
i
nothing
but
a
packet
of
woodbines
lord
i
did
feel
bad
looking
back
it
was
what
you
may
call
enjoyment
it
was
more
a
case
of
sticking
to
it
i
did
stick
i
i
was
determined
oh
hang
it
all
what
the
good
i
mean
the
good
of
living
in
a
room
for
ever
there
one
goes
on
day
after
day
same
old
game
same
up
and
down
to
town
until
you
forget
there
is
any
other
game
you
ought
to
see
once
in
a
way
what
going
on
outside
if
it
only
nothing
particular
after
all
i
should
just
think
you
ought
said
helen
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
table
the
sound
of
a
lady
voice
recalled
him
from
sincerity
and
he
said
curious
it
should
all
come
about
from
reading
something
of
richard
jefferies
excuse
me
bast
but
you
wrong
there
it
did
it
came
from
something
far
greater
but
she
could
not
stop
him
borrow
was
imminent
after
jefferies
borrow
thoreau
and
sorrow
brought
up
the
rear
and
the
outburst
ended
in
a
swamp
of
books
no
disrespect
to
these
great
names
the
fault
is
ours
not
theirs
they
mean
us
to
use
them
for
and
are
not
to
blame
if
in
our
weakness
we
mistake
the
for
the
destination
and
leonard
had
reached
the
destination
he
had
visited
the
county
of
surrey
when
darkness
covered
its
amenities
and
its
cosy
villas
had
ancient
night
every
twelve
hours
this
miracle
happens
but
he
had
troubled
to
go
and
see
for
himself
within
his
cramped
little
mind
dwelt
something
that
was
greater
than
jefferies
books
the
spirit
that
led
jefferies
to
write
them
and
his
dawn
though
revealing
nothing
but
monotones
was
part
of
the
eternal
sunrise
that
shows
george
borrow
stonehenge
then
you
do
think
i
was
foolish
he
asked
becoming
again
the
naive
and
boy
for
whom
nature
had
intended
him
heavens
no
replied
margaret
heaven
help
us
if
we
do
replied
helen
i
very
glad
you
say
that
now
my
wife
would
never
understand
not
if
i
explained
for
days
no
it
was
foolish
cried
helen
her
eyes
aflame
you
pushed
back
the
boundaries
i
think
it
splendid
of
you
you
not
been
content
to
dream
as
we
have
though
we
have
walked
too
i
must
show
you
a
picture
upstairs
here
the
rang
the
hansom
had
come
to
take
them
to
their
evening
party
oh
bother
not
to
say
dash
i
had
forgotten
we
were
dining
out
but
do
do
come
round
again
and
have
a
talk
yes
you
must
do
echoed
margaret
leonard
with
extreme
sentiment
replied
no
i
shall
not
it
better
like
this
why
better
asked
margaret
no
it
is
better
not
to
risk
a
second
interview
i
shall
always
look
back
on
this
talk
with
you
as
one
of
the
finest
things
in
my
life
really
i
mean
this
we
can
never
repeat
it
has
done
me
real
good
and
there
we
had
better
leave
it
that
rather
a
sad
view
of
life
surely
things
so
often
get
spoiled
i
know
flashed
helen
but
people
do
he
could
not
understand
this
he
continued
in
a
vein
which
mingled
true
imagination
and
false
what
he
said
was
wrong
but
it
was
right
and
a
false
note
jarred
one
little
twist
they
felt
and
the
instrument
might
be
in
tune
one
little
strain
and
it
might
be
silent
for
ever
he
thanked
the
ladies
very
much
but
he
would
not
call
again
there
was
a
moment
awkwardness
and
then
helen
said
go
then
perhaps
you
know
best
but
never
forget
you
better
than
jefferies
and
he
went
their
hansom
caught
him
up
at
the
corner
passed
with
a
waving
of
hands
and
vanished
with
its
accomplished
load
into
the
evening
london
was
beginning
to
illuminate
herself
against
the
night
electric
lights
sizzled
and
jagged
in
the
main
thoroughfares
in
the
side
streets
glimmered
a
canary
gold
or
green
the
sky
was
a
crimson
battlefield
of
spring
but
london
was
not
afraid
her
smoke
mitigated
the
splendour
and
the
clouds
down
oxford
street
were
a
delicately
painted
ceiling
which
adorned
while
it
did
not
distract
she
has
never
known
the
armies
of
the
purer
air
leonard
hurried
through
her
tinted
wonders
very
much
part
of
the
picture
his
was
a
grey
life
and
to
brighten
it
he
had
ruled
off
a
few
corners
for
romance
the
miss
schlegels
or
to
speak
more
accurately
his
interview
with
them
were
to
fill
such
a
corner
nor
was
it
by
any
means
the
first
time
that
he
had
talked
intimately
to
strangers
the
habit
was
analogous
to
a
debauch
an
outlet
though
the
worst
of
outlets
for
instincts
that
would
not
be
denied
terrifying
him
it
would
beat
down
his
suspicions
and
prudence
until
he
was
confiding
secrets
to
people
whom
he
had
scarcely
seen
it
brought
him
many
fears
and
some
pleasant
memories
perhaps
the
keenest
happiness
he
had
ever
known
was
during
a
railway
journey
to
cambridge
where
a
undergraduate
had
spoken
to
him
they
had
got
into
conversation
and
gradually
leonard
flung
reticence
aside
told
some
of
his
domestic
troubles
and
hinted
at
the
rest
the
undergraduate
supposing
they
could
start
a
friendship
asked
him
to
coffee
after
hall
which
he
accepted
but
afterwards
grew
shy
and
took
care
not
to
stir
from
the
commercial
hotel
where
he
lodged
he
did
not
want
romance
to
collide
with
the
porphyrion
still
less
with
jacky
and
people
with
fuller
happier
lives
are
slow
to
understand
this
to
the
schlegels
as
to
the
undergraduate
he
was
an
interesting
creature
of
whom
they
wanted
to
see
more
but
they
to
him
were
denizens
of
romance
who
must
keep
to
the
corner
he
had
assigned
them
pictures
that
must
not
walk
out
of
their
frames
his
behaviour
over
margaret
had
been
typical
his
had
scarcely
been
a
tragic
marriage
where
there
is
no
money
and
no
inclination
to
violence
tragedy
can
not
be
generated
he
could
not
leave
his
wife
and
he
did
not
want
to
hit
her
petulance
and
squalor
were
enough
here
that
card
had
come
in
leonard
though
furtive
was
untidy
and
left
it
lying
about
jacky
found
it
and
then
began
what
that
card
eh
yes
do
you
wish
you
knew
what
that
card
was
len
who
miss
schlegel
etc
months
passed
and
the
card
now
as
a
joke
now
as
a
grievance
was
handed
about
getting
dirtier
and
dirtier
it
followed
them
when
they
moved
from
cornelia
road
to
tulse
hill
it
was
submitted
to
third
parties
a
few
inches
of
pasteboard
it
became
the
battlefield
on
which
the
souls
of
leonard
and
his
wife
contended
why
did
he
not
say
a
lady
took
my
umbrella
another
gave
me
this
that
i
might
call
for
my
umbrella
because
jacky
would
have
disbelieved
him
partly
but
chiefly
because
he
was
sentimental
no
affection
gathered
round
the
card
but
it
symbolized
the
life
of
culture
that
jacky
should
never
spoil
at
night
he
would
say
to
himself
well
at
all
events
she
does
know
about
that
card
yah
done
her
there
poor
jacky
she
was
not
a
bad
sort
and
had
a
great
deal
to
bear
she
drew
her
own
conclusion
she
was
only
capable
of
drawing
one
conclusion
and
in
the
fulness
of
time
she
acted
upon
it
all
the
friday
leonard
had
refused
to
speak
to
her
and
had
spent
the
evening
observing
the
stars
on
the
saturday
he
went
up
as
usual
to
town
but
he
came
not
back
saturday
night
nor
sunday
morning
nor
sunday
afternoon
the
inconvenience
grew
intolerable
and
though
she
was
now
of
a
retiring
habit
and
shy
of
women
she
went
up
to
wickham
place
leonard
returned
in
her
absence
the
card
the
fatal
card
was
gone
from
the
pages
of
ruskin
and
he
guessed
what
had
happened
well
he
had
exclaimed
greeting
her
with
peals
of
laughter
i
know
where
you
been
but
you
do
know
where
i
jacky
sighed
said
len
i
do
think
you
might
explain
and
resumed
domesticity
explanations
were
difficult
at
this
stage
and
leonard
was
too
silly
or
it
is
tempting
to
write
too
sound
a
chap
to
attempt
them
his
reticence
was
not
entirely
the
shoddy
article
that
a
business
life
promotes
the
reticence
that
pretends
that
nothing
is
something
and
hides
behind
the
daily
telegraph
the
adventurer
also
is
reticent
and
it
is
an
adventure
for
a
clerk
to
walk
for
a
few
hours
in
darkness
you
may
laugh
at
him
you
who
have
slept
nights
on
the
veldt
with
your
rifle
beside
you
and
all
the
atmosphere
of
adventure
past
and
you
also
may
laugh
who
think
adventures
silly
but
do
not
be
surprised
if
leonard
is
shy
whenever
he
meets
you
and
if
the
schlegels
rather
than
jacky
hear
about
the
dawn
that
the
schlegels
had
not
thought
him
foolish
became
a
permanent
joy
he
was
at
his
best
when
he
thought
of
them
it
buoyed
him
as
he
journeyed
home
beneath
fading
heavens
somehow
the
barriers
of
wealth
had
fallen
and
there
had
been
he
could
not
phrase
it
a
general
assertion
of
the
wonder
of
the
world
my
conviction
says
the
mystic
gains
infinitely
the
moment
another
soul
will
believe
in
it
and
they
had
agreed
that
there
was
something
beyond
life
daily
grey
he
took
off
his
and
smoothed
it
thoughtfully
he
had
hitherto
supposed
the
unknown
to
be
books
literature
clever
conversation
culture
one
raised
oneself
by
study
and
got
upsides
with
the
world
but
in
that
quick
interchange
a
new
light
dawned
was
that
something
walking
in
the
dark
among
the
surburban
hills
he
discovered
that
he
was
going
bareheaded
down
regent
street
london
came
back
with
a
rush
few
were
about
at
this
hour
but
all
whom
he
passed
looked
at
him
with
a
hostility
that
was
the
more
impressive
because
it
was
unconscious
he
put
his
hat
on
it
was
too
big
his
head
disappeared
like
a
pudding
into
a
basin
the
ears
bending
outwards
at
the
touch
of
the
curly
brim
he
wore
it
a
little
backwards
and
its
effect
was
greatly
to
elongate
the
face
and
to
bring
out
the
distance
between
the
eyes
and
the
moustache
thus
equipped
he
escaped
criticism
no
one
felt
uneasy
as
he
titupped
along
the
pavements
the
heart
of
a
man
ticking
fast
in
his
chest
chapter
the
sisters
went
out
to
dinner
full
of
their
adventure
and
when
they
were
both
full
of
the
same
subject
there
were
few
that
could
stand
up
against
them
this
particular
one
which
was
all
ladies
had
more
kick
in
it
than
most
but
succumbed
after
a
struggle
helen
at
one
part
of
the
table
margaret
at
the
other
would
talk
of
bast
and
of
no
one
else
and
somewhere
about
the
entree
their
monologues
collided
fell
ruining
and
became
common
property
nor
was
this
all
the
was
really
an
informal
discussion
club
there
was
a
paper
after
it
read
amid
and
laughter
in
the
but
dealing
more
or
less
thoughtfully
with
some
topic
of
general
interest
after
the
paper
came
a
debate
and
in
this
debate
bast
also
figured
appearing
now
as
a
bright
spot
in
civilization
now
as
a
dark
spot
according
to
the
temperament
of
the
speaker
the
subject
of
the
paper
had
been
how
ought
i
to
dispose
of
my
money
the
reader
professing
to
be
a
millionaire
on
the
point
of
death
inclined
to
bequeath
her
fortune
for
the
foundation
of
local
art
galleries
but
open
to
conviction
from
other
sources
the
various
parts
had
been
assigned
beforehand
and
some
of
the
speeches
were
amusing
the
hostess
assumed
the
ungrateful
role
of
the
millionaire
eldest
son
and
implored
her
expiring
parent
not
to
dislocate
society
by
allowing
such
vast
sums
to
pass
out
of
the
family
money
was
the
fruit
of
and
the
second
generation
had
a
right
to
profit
by
the
of
the
first
what
right
had
bast
to
profit
the
national
gallery
was
good
enough
for
the
likes
of
him
after
property
had
had
its
say
a
saying
that
is
necessarily
ungracious
the
various
philanthropists
stepped
forward
something
must
be
done
for
bast
his
conditions
must
be
improved
without
impairing
his
independence
he
must
have
a
free
library
or
free
his
rent
must
be
paid
in
such
a
way
that
he
did
not
know
it
was
being
paid
it
must
be
made
worth
his
while
to
join
the
territorials
he
must
be
forcibly
parted
from
his
uninspiring
wife
the
money
going
to
her
as
compensation
he
must
be
assigned
a
twin
star
some
member
of
the
leisured
classes
who
would
watch
over
him
ceaselessly
groans
from
helen
he
must
be
given
food
but
no
clothes
clothes
but
no
food
a
ticket
to
venice
without
either
food
or
clothes
when
he
arrived
there
in
short
he
might
be
given
anything
and
everything
so
long
as
it
was
not
the
money
itself
and
here
margaret
interrupted
order
order
miss
schlegel
said
the
reader
of
the
paper
you
are
here
i
understand
to
advise
me
in
the
interests
of
the
society
for
the
preservation
of
places
of
historic
interest
or
natural
beauty
i
can
not
have
you
speaking
out
of
your
role
it
makes
my
poor
head
go
round
and
i
think
you
forget
that
i
am
very
your
head
wo
go
round
if
only
you
listen
to
my
argument
said
margaret
why
not
give
him
the
money
itself
you
supposed
to
have
about
thirty
thousand
a
year
have
i
i
thought
i
had
a
million
was
a
million
your
capital
dear
me
we
ought
to
have
settled
that
still
it
does
matter
whatever
you
got
i
order
you
to
give
as
many
poor
men
as
you
can
three
hundred
a
year
but
that
would
be
pauperizing
them
said
an
earnest
girl
who
liked
the
schlegels
but
thought
them
a
little
unspiritual
at
times
not
if
you
gave
them
so
much
a
big
windfall
would
not
pauperize
a
man
it
is
these
little
driblets
distributed
among
too
many
that
do
the
harm
money
educational
it
far
more
educational
than
the
things
it
buys
there
was
a
protest
in
a
sense
added
margaret
but
the
protest
continued
well
is
the
most
civilized
thing
going
the
man
who
has
learnt
to
wear
his
income
properly
exactly
what
your
basts
wo
do
give
them
a
chance
give
them
money
do
dole
them
out
and
like
babies
give
them
the
wherewithal
to
buy
these
things
when
your
socialism
comes
it
may
be
different
and
we
may
think
in
terms
of
commodities
instead
of
cash
till
it
comes
give
people
cash
for
it
is
the
warp
of
civilization
whatever
the
woof
may
be
the
imagination
ought
to
play
upon
money
and
realize
it
vividly
for
it
the
the
second
most
important
thing
in
the
world
it
is
so
sluffed
over
and
hushed
up
there
is
so
little
clear
thinking
oh
political
economy
of
course
but
so
few
of
us
think
clearly
about
our
own
private
incomes
and
admit
that
independent
thoughts
are
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
the
result
of
independent
means
money
give
bast
money
and
do
bother
about
his
ideals
he
pick
up
those
for
himself
she
leant
back
while
the
more
earnest
members
of
the
club
began
to
misconstrue
her
the
female
mind
though
cruelly
practical
in
daily
life
can
not
bear
to
hear
ideals
belittled
in
conversation
and
miss
schlegel
was
asked
however
she
could
say
such
dreadful
things
and
what
it
would
profit
bast
if
he
gained
the
whole
world
and
lost
his
own
soul
she
answered
nothing
but
he
would
not
gain
his
soul
until
he
had
gained
a
little
of
the
world
then
they
said
no
they
did
not
believe
it
and
she
admitted
that
an
overworked
clerk
may
save
his
soul
in
the
superterrestrial
sense
where
the
effort
will
be
taken
for
the
deed
but
she
denied
that
he
will
ever
explore
the
spiritual
resources
of
this
world
will
ever
know
the
rarer
joys
of
the
body
or
attain
to
clear
and
passionate
intercourse
with
his
fellows
others
had
attacked
the
fabric
of
interest
etc
she
only
fixed
her
eyes
on
a
few
human
beings
to
see
how
under
present
conditions
they
could
be
made
happier
doing
good
to
humanity
was
useless
the
efforts
thereto
spreading
over
the
vast
area
like
films
and
resulting
in
an
universal
grey
to
do
good
to
one
or
as
in
this
case
to
a
few
was
the
utmost
she
dare
hope
for
between
the
idealists
and
the
political
economists
margaret
had
a
bad
time
disagreeing
elsewhere
they
agreed
in
disowning
her
and
in
keeping
the
administration
of
the
millionaire
money
in
their
own
hands
the
earnest
girl
brought
forward
a
scheme
of
personal
supervision
and
mutual
help
the
effect
of
which
was
to
alter
poor
people
until
they
became
exactly
like
people
who
were
not
so
poor
the
hostess
pertinently
remarked
that
she
as
eldest
son
might
surely
rank
among
the
millionaire
legatees
margaret
weakly
admitted
the
claim
and
another
claim
was
at
once
set
up
by
helen
who
declared
that
she
had
been
the
millionaire
housemaid
for
over
forty
years
overfed
and
underpaid
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
her
so
corpulent
and
poor
the
millionaire
then
read
out
her
last
will
and
testament
in
which
she
left
the
whole
of
her
fortune
to
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
then
she
died
the
serious
parts
of
the
discussion
had
been
of
higher
merit
than
the
playful
in
a
men
debate
is
the
reverse
more
general
but
the
meeting
broke
up
hilariously
enough
and
a
dozen
happy
ladies
dispersed
to
their
homes
helen
and
margaret
walked
the
earnest
girl
as
far
as
battersea
bridge
station
arguing
copiously
all
the
way
when
she
had
gone
they
were
conscious
of
an
alleviation
and
of
the
great
beauty
of
the
evening
they
turned
back
towards
oakley
street
the
lamps
and
the
following
the
line
of
the
embankment
struck
a
note
of
dignity
that
is
rare
in
english
cities
the
seats
almost
deserted
were
here
and
there
occupied
by
gentlefolk
in
evening
dress
who
had
strolled
out
from
the
houses
behind
to
enjoy
fresh
air
and
the
whisper
of
the
rising
tide
there
is
something
continental
about
chelsea
embankment
it
is
an
open
space
used
rightly
a
blessing
more
frequent
in
germany
than
here
as
margaret
and
helen
sat
down
the
city
behind
them
seemed
to
be
a
vast
theatre
an
in
which
some
endless
trilogy
was
performing
and
they
themselves
a
pair
of
satisfied
subscribers
who
did
not
mind
losing
a
little
of
the
second
act
cold
no
tired
does
matter
the
earnest
girl
train
rumbled
away
over
the
bridge
i
say
helen
well
are
we
really
going
to
follow
up
mr
bast
i
do
know
i
think
we
wo
as
you
like
it
no
good
i
think
unless
you
really
mean
to
know
people
the
discussion
brought
that
home
to
me
we
got
on
well
enough
with
him
in
a
spirit
of
excitement
but
think
of
rational
intercourse
we
must
play
at
friendship
no
it
no
good
there
lanoline
too
helen
yawned
so
dull
just
so
and
possibly
worse
than
dull
i
should
like
to
know
how
he
got
hold
of
your
card
but
he
said
something
about
a
concert
and
an
umbrella
then
did
the
card
see
the
wife
helen
come
to
bed
no
just
a
little
longer
it
is
so
beautiful
tell
me
oh
yes
did
you
say
money
is
the
warp
of
the
world
yes
then
what
the
woof
very
much
what
one
chooses
said
margaret
something
that
is
money
one
ca
say
more
walking
at
night
probably
for
tibby
oxford
it
seems
so
for
you
now
that
we
have
to
leave
wickham
place
i
begin
to
think
it
that
for
wilcox
it
was
certainly
howards
end
one
own
name
will
carry
immense
distances
wilcox
who
was
sitting
with
friends
many
seats
away
heard
his
rose
to
his
feet
and
strolled
along
towards
the
speakers
it
is
sad
to
suppose
that
places
may
ever
be
more
important
than
people
continued
margaret
why
meg
they
so
much
nicer
generally
i
rather
think
of
that
forester
house
in
pomerania
than
of
the
fat
herr
forstmeister
who
lived
in
it
i
believe
we
shall
come
to
care
about
people
less
and
less
helen
the
more
people
one
knows
the
easier
it
becomes
to
replace
them
it
one
of
the
curses
of
london
i
quite
expect
to
end
my
life
caring
most
for
a
place
here
wilcox
reached
them
it
was
several
weeks
since
they
had
met
how
do
you
do
he
cried
i
thought
i
recognized
your
voices
whatever
are
you
both
doing
down
here
his
tones
were
protective
he
implied
that
one
ought
not
to
sit
out
on
chelsea
embankment
without
a
male
escort
helen
resented
this
but
margaret
accepted
it
as
part
of
the
good
man
equipment
what
an
age
it
is
since
i
seen
you
wilcox
i
met
evie
in
the
tube
though
lately
i
hope
you
have
good
news
of
your
son
paul
said
wilcox
extinguishing
his
cigarette
and
sitting
down
between
them
oh
paul
all
right
we
had
a
line
from
madeira
he
be
at
work
again
by
now
ugh
said
helen
shuddering
from
complex
causes
i
beg
your
pardon
is
the
climate
of
nigeria
too
horrible
someone
got
to
go
he
said
simply
england
will
never
keep
her
trade
overseas
unless
she
is
prepared
to
make
sacrifices
unless
we
get
firm
in
west
africa
ger
untold
complications
may
follow
now
tell
me
all
your
news
oh
we
had
a
splendid
evening
cried
helen
who
always
woke
up
at
the
advent
of
a
visitor
we
belong
to
a
kind
of
club
that
reads
papers
margaret
and
i
all
women
but
there
is
a
discussion
after
this
evening
it
was
on
how
one
ought
to
leave
one
money
whether
to
one
family
or
to
the
poor
and
if
so
how
oh
most
interesting
the
man
of
business
smiled
since
his
wife
death
he
had
almost
doubled
his
income
he
was
an
important
figure
at
last
a
reassuring
name
on
company
prospectuses
and
life
had
treated
him
very
well
the
world
seemed
in
his
grasp
as
he
listened
to
the
river
thames
which
still
flowed
inland
from
the
sea
so
wonderful
to
the
girls
it
held
no
mysteries
for
him
he
had
helped
to
shorten
its
long
tidal
trough
by
taking
shares
in
the
lock
at
teddington
and
if
he
and
other
capitalists
thought
good
some
day
it
could
be
shortened
again
with
a
good
dinner
inside
him
and
an
amiable
but
academic
woman
on
either
flank
he
felt
that
his
hands
were
on
all
the
ropes
of
life
and
that
what
he
did
not
know
could
not
be
worth
knowing
sounds
a
most
original
entertainment
he
exclaimed
and
laughed
in
his
pleasant
way
i
wish
evie
would
go
to
that
sort
of
thing
but
she
has
the
time
she
taken
to
breed
aberdeen
terriers
jolly
little
dogs
i
expect
we
better
be
doing
the
same
really
we
pretend
we
improving
ourselves
you
see
said
helen
a
little
sharply
for
the
wilcox
glamour
is
not
of
the
kind
that
returns
and
she
had
bitter
memories
of
the
days
when
a
speech
such
as
he
had
just
made
would
have
impressed
her
favourably
we
suppose
it
is
a
good
thing
to
waste
an
evening
once
a
fortnight
over
a
debate
but
as
my
sister
says
it
may
be
better
to
breed
dogs
not
at
all
i
do
agree
with
your
sister
nothing
like
a
debate
to
teach
one
quickness
i
often
wish
i
had
gone
in
for
them
when
i
was
a
youngster
it
would
have
helped
me
no
end
quickness
yes
quickness
in
argument
time
after
time
missed
scoring
a
point
because
the
other
man
has
had
the
gift
of
the
gab
and
i
have
oh
i
believe
in
these
discussions
the
patronizing
tone
thought
margaret
came
well
enough
from
a
man
who
was
old
enough
to
be
their
father
she
had
always
maintained
that
wilcox
had
a
charm
in
times
of
sorrow
or
emotion
his
inadequacy
had
pained
her
but
it
was
pleasant
to
listen
to
him
now
and
to
watch
his
thick
brown
moustache
and
high
forehead
confronting
the
stars
but
helen
was
nettled
the
aim
of
their
debates
she
implied
was
truth
oh
yes
it
does
much
matter
what
subject
you
take
said
he
margaret
laughed
and
said
but
this
is
going
to
be
far
better
than
the
debate
itself
helen
recovered
herself
and
laughed
too
no
i
wo
go
on
she
declared
i
just
put
our
special
case
to
mr
wilcox
about
bast
yes
do
he
be
more
lenient
to
a
special
case
but
wilcox
do
first
light
another
cigarette
it
this
we
just
come
across
a
young
fellow
evidently
very
poor
and
who
seems
interest
what
his
profession
clerk
what
in
do
you
remember
margaret
porphyrion
fire
insurance
company
oh
yes
the
nice
people
who
gave
aunt
juley
a
new
he
seems
interesting
in
some
ways
very
and
one
wishes
one
could
help
him
he
is
married
to
a
wife
whom
he
does
seem
to
care
for
much
he
likes
books
and
what
one
may
roughly
call
adventure
and
if
he
had
a
chance
but
he
is
so
poor
he
lives
a
life
where
all
the
money
is
apt
to
go
on
nonsense
and
clothes
one
is
so
afraid
that
circumstances
will
be
too
strong
for
him
and
that
he
will
sink
well
he
got
mixed
up
in
our
debate
he
was
the
subject
of
it
but
it
seemed
to
bear
on
his
point
suppose
a
millionaire
died
and
desired
to
leave
money
to
help
such
a
man
how
should
he
be
helped
should
he
be
given
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
direct
which
was
margaret
plan
most
of
them
thought
this
would
pauperize
him
should
he
and
those
like
him
be
given
free
libraries
i
said
he
does
want
more
books
to
read
but
to
read
books
rightly
my
suggestion
was
he
should
be
given
something
every
year
towards
a
summer
holiday
but
then
there
is
his
wife
and
they
said
she
would
have
to
go
too
nothing
seemed
quite
right
now
what
do
you
think
imagine
that
you
were
a
millionaire
and
wanted
to
help
the
poor
what
would
you
do
wilcox
whose
fortune
was
not
so
very
far
below
the
standard
indicated
laughed
exuberantly
my
dear
miss
schlegel
i
will
not
rush
in
where
your
sex
has
been
unable
to
tread
i
will
not
add
another
plan
to
the
numerous
excellent
ones
that
have
been
already
suggested
my
only
contribution
is
this
let
your
young
friend
clear
out
of
the
porphyrion
fire
insurance
company
with
all
possible
speed
why
said
margaret
he
lowered
his
voice
this
is
between
friends
be
in
the
receiver
hands
before
christmas
it
smash
he
added
thinking
that
she
had
not
understood
dear
me
helen
listen
to
that
and
he
have
to
get
another
place
will
have
let
him
leave
the
ship
before
it
sinks
let
him
get
one
now
rather
than
wait
to
make
sure
decidedly
why
that
again
the
olympian
laugh
and
the
lowered
voice
naturally
the
man
who
in
a
situation
when
he
applies
stands
a
better
chance
is
in
a
stronger
position
than
the
man
who
is
it
looks
as
if
he
worth
something
i
know
by
myself
this
is
letting
you
into
the
state
secrets
it
affects
an
employer
greatly
human
nature
i
afraid
i
had
thought
of
that
murmured
margaret
while
helen
said
our
human
nature
appears
to
be
the
other
way
round
we
employ
people
because
they
unemployed
the
boot
man
for
instance
and
how
does
he
clean
the
boots
not
well
confessed
margaret
there
you
are
then
do
you
really
advise
us
to
tell
this
youth
i
advise
nothing
he
interrupted
glancing
up
and
down
the
embankment
in
case
his
indiscretion
had
been
overheard
i
ought
to
have
spoken
but
i
happen
to
know
being
more
or
less
behind
the
scenes
the
porphyrion
a
bad
bad
concern
now
do
say
i
said
so
it
outside
the
tariff
ring
certainly
i
wo
say
in
fact
i
do
know
what
that
means
i
thought
an
insurance
company
never
smashed
was
helen
contribution
do
the
others
always
run
in
and
save
them
you
thinking
of
reinsurance
said
wilcox
mildly
it
is
exactly
there
that
the
porphyrion
is
weak
it
has
tried
to
undercut
has
been
badly
hit
by
a
long
series
of
small
fires
and
it
has
been
able
to
reinsure
i
afraid
that
public
companies
do
save
one
another
for
love
nature
i
suppose
quoted
helen
and
he
laughed
and
agreed
that
it
was
when
margaret
said
that
she
supposed
that
clerks
like
every
one
else
found
it
extremely
difficult
to
get
situations
in
these
days
he
replied
yes
extremely
and
rose
to
rejoin
his
friends
he
knew
by
his
own
office
seldom
a
vacant
post
and
hundreds
of
applicants
for
it
at
present
no
vacant
post
and
how
howards
end
looking
said
margaret
wishing
to
change
the
subject
before
they
parted
wilcox
was
a
little
apt
to
think
one
wanted
to
get
something
out
of
him
it
let
really
and
you
wandering
homeless
in
chelsea
how
strange
are
the
ways
of
fate
no
it
let
unfurnished
we
moved
why
i
thought
of
you
both
as
anchored
there
for
ever
evie
never
told
me
i
dare
say
when
you
met
evie
the
thing
was
settled
we
only
moved
a
week
ago
paul
has
rather
a
feeling
for
the
old
place
and
we
held
on
for
him
to
have
his
holiday
there
but
really
it
is
impossibly
small
endless
drawbacks
i
forget
whether
you
been
up
to
it
as
far
as
the
house
never
well
howards
end
is
one
of
those
converted
farms
they
do
really
do
spend
what
you
will
on
them
we
messed
away
with
a
garage
all
among
the
roots
and
last
year
we
enclosed
a
bit
of
the
meadow
and
attempted
a
mockery
evie
got
rather
keen
on
alpine
plants
but
it
did
do
no
it
did
do
you
remember
or
your
sister
will
remember
the
farm
with
those
abominable
and
the
hedge
that
the
old
woman
never
would
cut
properly
so
that
it
all
went
thin
at
the
bottom
and
inside
the
house
the
beams
and
the
staircase
through
a
door
picturesque
enough
but
not
a
place
to
live
in
he
glanced
over
the
parapet
cheerfully
full
tide
and
the
position
was
right
either
the
neighbourhood
getting
suburban
either
be
in
london
or
out
of
it
i
say
so
taken
a
house
in
ducie
street
close
to
sloane
street
and
a
place
right
down
in
shropshire
oniton
grange
ever
heard
of
oniton
do
come
and
see
us
right
away
from
everywhere
up
towards
what
a
change
said
margaret
but
the
change
was
in
her
own
voice
which
had
become
most
sad
i
ca
imagine
howards
end
or
hilton
without
you
hilton
is
without
us
he
replied
charles
is
there
still
still
said
margaret
who
had
not
kept
up
with
the
charles
but
i
thought
he
was
still
at
epsom
they
were
furnishing
that
christmas
one
christmas
how
everything
alters
i
used
to
admire
charles
from
our
windows
very
often
was
it
epsom
yes
but
they
moved
eighteen
months
ago
charles
the
good
chap
his
voice
dropped
thought
i
should
be
lonely
i
did
want
him
to
move
but
he
would
and
took
a
house
at
the
other
end
of
hilton
down
by
the
six
hills
he
had
a
motor
too
there
they
all
are
a
very
jolly
party
he
and
she
and
the
two
grandchildren
i
manage
other
people
affairs
so
much
better
than
they
manage
them
themselves
said
margaret
as
they
shook
hands
when
you
moved
out
of
howards
end
i
should
have
moved
charles
wilcox
into
it
i
should
have
kept
so
remarkable
a
place
in
the
family
so
it
is
he
replied
i
have
sold
it
and
mean
to
no
but
none
of
you
are
there
oh
we
got
a
splendid
tenant
hamar
bryce
an
invalid
if
charles
ever
wanted
it
but
he
wo
dolly
is
so
dependent
on
modern
conveniences
no
we
have
all
decided
against
howards
end
we
like
it
in
a
way
but
now
we
feel
that
it
is
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
one
must
have
one
thing
or
the
other
and
some
people
are
lucky
enough
to
have
both
doing
yourself
proud
wilcox
my
congratulations
and
mine
said
helen
do
remind
evie
to
come
and
see
us
two
wickham
place
we
sha
be
there
very
long
either
you
too
on
the
move
next
september
margaret
sighed
every
one
moving
the
tide
had
begun
to
ebb
margaret
leant
over
the
parapet
and
watched
it
sadly
wilcox
had
forgotten
his
wife
helen
her
lover
she
herself
was
probably
forgetting
every
one
moving
is
it
worth
while
attempting
the
past
when
there
is
this
continual
flux
even
in
the
hearts
of
men
helen
roused
her
by
saying
what
a
prosperous
vulgarian
wilcox
has
grown
i
have
very
little
use
for
him
in
these
days
however
he
did
tell
us
about
the
porphyrion
let
us
write
to
bast
as
soon
as
ever
we
get
home
and
tell
him
to
clear
out
of
it
at
once
do
yes
that
worth
doing
let
us
let
ask
him
to
tea
chapter
leonard
accepted
the
invitation
to
tea
next
saturday
but
he
was
right
the
visit
proved
a
conspicuous
failure
sugar
said
margaret
cake
said
helen
the
big
cake
or
the
little
deadlies
i
afraid
you
thought
my
letter
rather
odd
but
we
explain
we
are
odd
really
not
affected
really
we
that
as
a
lady
leonard
did
not
excel
he
was
not
an
italian
still
less
a
frenchman
in
whose
blood
there
runs
the
very
spirit
of
persiflage
and
of
gracious
repartee
his
wit
was
the
cockney
it
opened
no
doors
into
imagination
and
helen
was
drawn
up
short
by
the
more
a
lady
has
to
say
the
better
administered
waggishly
oh
yes
she
said
ladies
brighten
yes
i
know
the
darlings
are
regular
sunbeams
let
me
give
you
a
plate
how
do
you
like
your
work
interposed
margaret
he
too
was
drawn
up
short
he
would
not
have
these
women
prying
into
his
work
they
were
romance
and
so
was
the
room
to
which
he
had
at
last
penetrated
with
the
queer
sketches
of
people
bathing
upon
its
walls
and
so
were
the
very
with
their
delicate
borders
of
wild
strawberries
but
he
would
not
let
romance
interfere
with
his
life
there
is
the
devil
to
pay
then
oh
well
enough
he
answered
your
company
is
the
porphyrion
is
it
yes
that
so
becoming
rather
offended
it
funny
how
things
get
round
why
funny
asked
helen
who
did
not
follow
the
workings
of
his
mind
it
was
written
as
large
as
life
on
your
card
and
considering
we
wrote
to
you
there
and
that
you
replied
on
the
stamped
paper
would
you
call
the
porphyrion
one
of
the
big
insurance
companies
pursued
margaret
it
depends
what
you
call
big
i
mean
by
big
a
solid
concern
that
offers
a
reasonably
good
career
to
its
employes
i
could
say
some
would
tell
you
one
thing
and
others
another
said
the
employe
uneasily
for
my
own
part
he
shook
his
head
i
only
believe
half
i
hear
not
that
even
it
safer
those
clever
ones
come
to
the
worse
grief
i
often
noticed
ah
you
ca
be
too
careful
he
drank
and
wiped
his
moustache
which
was
going
to
be
one
of
those
moustaches
that
always
droop
into
more
bother
than
they
worth
surely
and
not
fashionable
either
i
quite
agree
and
that
why
i
was
curious
to
know
is
it
a
solid
concern
leonard
had
no
idea
he
understood
his
own
corner
of
the
machine
but
nothing
beyond
it
he
desired
to
confess
neither
knowledge
nor
ignorance
and
under
these
circumstances
another
motion
of
the
head
seemed
safest
to
him
as
to
the
british
public
the
porphyrion
was
the
porphyrion
of
the
advertisement
a
giant
in
the
classical
style
but
draped
sufficiently
who
held
in
one
hand
a
burning
torch
and
pointed
with
the
other
to
paul
and
windsor
castle
a
large
sum
of
money
was
inscribed
below
and
you
drew
your
own
conclusions
this
giant
caused
leonard
to
do
arithmetic
and
write
letters
to
explain
the
regulations
to
new
clients
and
them
to
old
ones
a
giant
was
of
an
impulsive
morality
one
knew
that
much
he
would
pay
for
munt
with
ostentatious
haste
a
large
claim
he
would
repudiate
quietly
and
fight
court
by
court
but
his
true
fighting
weight
his
antecedents
his
amours
with
other
members
of
the
commercial
pantheon
all
these
were
as
uncertain
to
ordinary
mortals
as
were
the
escapades
of
zeus
while
the
gods
are
powerful
we
learn
little
about
them
it
is
only
in
the
days
of
their
decadence
that
a
strong
light
beats
into
heaven
we
were
told
the
porphyrion
no
go
blurted
helen
we
wanted
to
tell
you
that
why
we
wrote
a
friend
of
ours
did
think
that
it
is
unsufficiently
reinsured
said
margaret
now
leonard
had
his
clue
he
must
praise
the
porphyrion
you
can
tell
your
friend
he
said
that
quite
wrong
oh
good
the
young
man
coloured
a
little
in
his
circle
to
be
wrong
was
fatal
the
miss
schlegels
did
not
mind
being
wrong
they
were
genuinely
glad
that
they
had
been
misinformed
to
them
nothing
was
fatal
but
evil
wrong
so
to
speak
he
added
how
to
speak
i
mean
i
would
say
he
right
altogether
but
this
was
a
blunder
then
he
is
right
partly
said
the
elder
woman
quick
as
lightning
leonard
replied
that
every
one
was
right
partly
if
it
came
to
that
bast
i
do
understand
business
and
i
dare
say
my
questions
are
stupid
but
can
you
tell
me
what
makes
a
concern
or
leonard
sat
back
with
a
sigh
our
friend
who
is
also
a
business
man
was
so
positive
he
said
before
christmas
and
advised
you
to
clear
out
of
it
concluded
helen
but
i
do
see
why
he
should
know
better
than
you
do
leonard
rubbed
his
hands
he
was
tempted
to
say
that
he
knew
nothing
about
the
thing
at
all
but
a
commercial
training
was
too
strong
for
him
nor
could
he
say
it
was
a
bad
thing
for
this
would
be
giving
it
away
nor
yet
that
it
was
good
for
this
would
be
giving
it
away
equally
he
attempted
to
suggest
that
it
was
something
between
the
two
with
vast
possibilities
in
either
direction
but
broke
down
under
the
gaze
of
four
sincere
eyes
as
yet
he
scarcely
distinguished
between
the
two
sisters
one
was
more
beautiful
and
more
lively
but
the
miss
schlegels
still
remained
a
composite
indian
god
whose
waving
arms
and
contradictory
speeches
were
the
product
of
a
single
mind
one
can
but
see
he
remarked
adding
as
ibsen
says
happen
he
was
itching
to
talk
about
books
and
make
the
most
of
his
romantic
hour
minute
after
minute
slipped
away
while
the
ladies
with
imperfect
skill
discussed
the
subject
of
reinsurance
or
praised
their
anonymous
friend
leonard
grew
annoyed
perhaps
rightly
he
made
vague
remarks
about
not
being
one
of
those
who
minded
their
affairs
being
talked
over
by
others
but
they
did
not
take
the
hint
men
might
have
shown
more
tact
women
however
tactful
elsewhere
are
here
they
can
not
see
why
we
should
shroud
our
incomes
and
our
prospects
in
a
veil
how
much
exactly
have
you
and
how
much
do
you
expect
to
have
next
june
and
these
were
women
with
a
theory
who
held
that
reticence
about
money
matters
is
absurd
and
that
life
would
be
truer
if
each
would
state
the
exact
size
of
the
golden
island
upon
which
he
stands
the
exact
stretch
of
warp
over
which
he
throws
the
woof
that
is
not
money
how
can
we
do
justice
to
the
pattern
otherwise
and
the
precious
minutes
slipped
away
and
jacky
and
squalor
came
nearer
at
last
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
broke
in
reciting
the
names
of
books
feverishly
there
was
a
moment
of
piercing
joy
when
margaret
said
so
you
like
carlyle
and
then
the
door
opened
and
wilcox
miss
wilcox
entered
preceded
by
two
prancing
puppies
oh
the
dears
oh
evie
how
too
impossibly
sweet
screamed
helen
falling
on
her
hands
and
knees
we
brought
the
little
fellows
round
said
wilcox
i
bred
myself
oh
really
bast
come
and
play
with
puppies
i
got
to
be
going
now
said
leonard
sourly
but
play
with
puppies
a
little
first
this
is
ahab
that
jezebel
said
evie
who
was
one
of
those
who
name
animals
after
the
less
successful
characters
of
old
testament
history
i
got
to
be
going
helen
was
too
much
occupied
with
puppies
to
notice
him
wilcox
ba
must
you
be
really
come
again
said
helen
from
the
floor
then
leonard
gorge
arose
why
should
he
come
again
what
was
the
good
of
it
he
said
roundly
no
i
sha
i
knew
it
would
be
a
failure
most
people
would
have
let
him
go
a
little
mistake
we
tried
knowing
another
class
impossible
but
the
schlegels
had
never
played
with
life
they
had
attempted
friendship
and
they
would
take
the
consequences
helen
retorted
i
call
that
a
very
rude
remark
what
do
you
want
to
turn
on
me
like
that
for
and
suddenly
the
to
a
vulgar
row
you
ask
me
why
i
turn
on
you
yes
what
do
you
want
to
have
me
here
for
to
help
you
you
silly
boy
cried
helen
and
do
shout
i
do
want
your
patronage
i
do
want
your
tea
i
was
quite
happy
what
do
you
want
to
unsettle
me
for
he
turned
to
wilcox
i
put
it
to
this
gentleman
i
ask
you
sir
am
to
have
my
brain
picked
wilcox
turned
to
margaret
with
the
air
of
humorous
strength
that
he
could
so
well
command
are
we
intruding
miss
schlegel
can
we
be
of
any
use
or
shall
we
go
but
margaret
ignored
him
i
connected
with
a
leading
insurance
company
sir
i
receive
what
i
take
to
be
an
invitation
from
these
ladies
he
drawled
the
word
i
come
and
it
to
have
my
brain
picked
i
ask
you
is
it
fair
highly
unfair
said
wilcox
drawing
a
gasp
from
evie
who
knew
that
her
father
was
becoming
dangerous
there
you
hear
that
most
unfair
the
gentleman
says
there
not
content
with
pointing
at
margaret
you
ca
deny
it
his
voice
rose
he
was
falling
into
the
rhythm
of
a
scene
with
jacky
but
as
soon
as
i
useful
it
a
very
different
thing
yes
send
for
him
him
pick
his
brains
oh
yes
now
take
me
on
the
whole
i
a
quiet
fellow
i
i
wish
any
unpleasantness
but
i
i
you
said
margaret
you
you
laughter
from
evie
as
at
a
repartee
you
are
the
man
who
tried
to
walk
by
the
pole
star
more
laughter
you
saw
the
sunrise
laughter
you
tried
to
get
away
from
the
fogs
that
are
stifling
us
all
away
past
books
and
houses
to
the
truth
you
were
looking
for
a
real
i
fail
to
see
the
connection
said
leonard
hot
with
stupid
anger
so
do
i
there
was
a
pause
you
were
that
last
sunday
you
are
this
today
bast
i
and
my
sister
have
talked
you
over
we
wanted
to
help
you
we
also
supposed
you
might
help
us
we
did
not
have
you
here
out
of
charity
which
bores
us
but
because
we
hoped
there
would
be
a
connection
between
last
sunday
and
other
days
what
is
the
good
of
your
stars
and
trees
your
sunrise
and
the
wind
if
they
do
not
enter
into
our
daily
lives
they
have
never
entered
into
mine
but
into
yours
we
thought
have
we
all
to
struggle
against
life
daily
greyness
against
pettiness
against
mechanical
cheerfulness
against
suspicion
i
struggle
by
remembering
my
friends
others
i
have
known
by
remembering
some
place
some
beloved
place
or
tree
we
thought
you
one
of
these
of
course
if
there
been
any
misunderstanding
mumbled
leonard
all
i
can
do
is
to
go
but
i
beg
to
state
he
paused
ahab
and
jezebel
danced
at
his
boots
and
made
him
look
ridiculous
you
were
picking
my
brain
for
official
information
i
can
prove
it
i
he
blew
his
nose
and
left
them
can
i
help
you
now
said
wilcox
turning
to
margaret
may
i
have
one
quiet
word
with
him
in
the
hall
helen
go
after
him
do
anything
anything
to
make
the
noodle
understand
helen
hesitated
but
really
said
their
visitor
ought
she
to
at
once
she
went
he
resumed
i
would
have
chimed
in
but
i
felt
that
you
could
polish
him
off
for
yourselves
i
interfere
you
were
splendid
miss
schlegel
absolutely
splendid
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
but
there
are
very
few
women
who
could
have
managed
him
oh
yes
said
margaret
distractedly
bowling
him
over
with
those
long
sentences
was
what
fetched
me
cried
evie
yes
indeed
chuckled
her
father
all
that
part
about
cheerfulness
oh
fine
i
very
sorry
said
margaret
collecting
herself
he
a
nice
creature
really
i
can
not
think
what
set
him
off
it
has
been
most
unpleasant
for
you
oh
did
mind
then
he
changed
his
mood
he
asked
if
he
might
speak
as
an
old
friend
and
permission
given
said
ought
you
really
to
be
more
careful
margaret
laughed
though
her
thoughts
still
strayed
after
helen
do
you
realize
that
it
all
your
fault
she
said
you
responsible
i
this
is
the
young
man
whom
we
were
to
warn
against
the
porphyrion
we
warn
him
and
look
wilcox
was
annoyed
i
hardly
consider
that
a
fair
deduction
he
said
obviously
unfair
said
margaret
i
was
only
thinking
how
tangled
things
are
it
our
fault
mostly
neither
yours
nor
his
not
his
no
miss
schlegel
you
are
too
kind
yes
indeed
nodded
evie
a
little
contemptuously
you
behave
much
too
well
to
people
and
then
they
impose
on
you
i
know
the
world
and
that
type
of
man
and
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
room
i
saw
you
had
not
been
treating
him
properly
you
must
keep
that
type
at
a
distance
otherwise
they
forget
themselves
sad
but
true
they
are
our
sort
and
one
must
face
the
fact
do
admit
that
we
should
never
have
had
the
outburst
if
he
was
a
gentleman
i
admit
it
willingly
said
margaret
who
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
a
gentleman
would
have
kept
his
suspicions
to
himself
wilcox
watched
her
with
a
vague
uneasiness
what
did
he
suspect
you
of
of
wanting
to
make
money
out
of
him
intolerable
brute
but
how
were
you
to
benefit
exactly
how
indeed
just
horrible
corroding
suspicion
one
touch
of
thought
or
of
goodwill
would
have
brushed
it
away
just
the
senseless
fear
that
does
make
men
intolerable
brutes
i
come
back
to
my
original
point
you
ought
to
be
more
careful
miss
schlegel
your
servants
ought
to
have
orders
not
to
let
such
people
in
she
turned
to
him
frankly
let
me
explain
exactly
why
we
like
this
man
and
want
to
see
him
again
that
your
clever
way
of
thinking
i
shall
never
believe
you
like
him
i
do
firstly
because
he
cares
for
physical
adventure
just
as
you
do
yes
you
go
motoring
and
shooting
he
would
like
to
go
camping
out
secondly
he
cares
for
something
special
in
adventure
it
is
quickest
to
call
that
special
something
poetry
oh
he
one
of
that
writer
sort
no
oh
no
i
mean
he
may
be
but
it
would
be
loathsome
stiff
his
brain
is
filled
with
the
husks
of
books
culture
horrible
we
want
him
to
wash
out
his
brain
and
go
to
the
real
thing
we
want
to
show
him
how
he
may
get
upsides
with
life
as
i
said
either
friends
or
the
country
some
she
hesitated
either
some
very
dear
person
or
some
very
dear
place
seems
necessary
to
relieve
daily
grey
and
to
show
that
it
is
grey
if
possible
one
should
have
both
some
of
her
words
ran
past
wilcox
he
let
them
run
past
others
he
caught
and
criticized
with
admirable
lucidity
your
mistake
is
this
and
it
is
a
very
common
mistake
this
young
bounder
has
a
life
of
his
own
what
right
have
you
to
conclude
it
is
an
unsuccessful
life
or
as
you
call
it
because
one
minute
you
know
nothing
about
him
he
probably
has
his
own
joys
and
interests
wife
children
snug
little
home
that
where
we
practical
fellows
he
smiled
are
more
tolerant
than
you
intellectuals
we
live
and
let
live
and
assume
that
things
are
jogging
on
fairly
well
elsewhere
and
that
the
ordinary
plain
man
may
be
trusted
to
look
after
his
own
affairs
i
quite
grant
i
look
at
the
faces
of
the
clerks
in
my
own
office
and
observe
them
to
be
dull
but
i
do
know
what
going
on
beneath
so
by
the
way
with
london
i
have
heard
you
rail
against
london
miss
schlegel
and
it
seems
a
funny
thing
to
say
but
i
was
very
angry
with
you
what
do
you
know
about
london
you
only
see
civilization
from
the
outside
i
do
say
in
your
case
but
in
too
many
cases
that
attitude
leads
to
morbidity
discontent
and
socialism
she
admitted
the
strength
of
his
position
though
it
undermined
imagination
as
he
spoke
some
outposts
of
poetry
and
perhaps
of
sympathy
fell
ruining
and
she
retreated
to
what
she
called
her
second
line
to
the
special
facts
of
the
case
his
wife
is
an
old
bore
she
said
simply
he
never
came
home
last
saturday
night
because
he
wanted
to
be
alone
and
she
thought
he
was
with
us
with
you
yes
evie
tittered
he
has
got
the
cosy
home
that
you
assumed
he
needs
outside
interests
naughty
young
man
cried
the
girl
naughty
said
margaret
who
hated
naughtiness
more
than
sin
when
you
married
miss
wilcox
wo
you
want
outside
interests
he
has
apparently
got
them
put
in
wilcox
slyly
yes
indeed
father
he
was
tramping
in
surrey
if
you
mean
that
said
margaret
pacing
away
rather
crossly
oh
i
dare
say
miss
wilcox
he
was
from
wilcox
who
thought
the
episode
amusing
if
risque
with
most
ladies
he
would
not
have
discussed
it
but
he
was
trading
on
margaret
reputation
as
an
emanicipated
woman
he
said
so
and
about
such
a
thing
he
would
lie
they
both
began
to
laugh
that
where
i
differ
from
you
men
lie
about
their
positions
and
prospects
but
not
about
a
thing
of
that
sort
he
shook
his
head
miss
schlegel
excuse
me
but
i
know
the
type
i
said
before
he
is
a
type
he
cares
about
adventures
rightly
he
certain
that
our
smug
existence
is
all
he
vulgar
and
hysterical
and
bookish
but
i
do
think
that
sums
him
up
there
manhood
in
him
as
well
yes
that
what
i
trying
to
say
he
a
real
man
as
she
spoke
their
eyes
met
and
it
was
as
if
wilcox
defences
fell
she
saw
back
to
the
real
man
in
him
unwittingly
she
had
touched
his
emotions
a
woman
and
two
men
they
had
formed
the
magic
triangle
of
sex
and
the
male
was
thrilled
to
jealousy
in
case
the
female
was
attracted
by
another
male
love
say
the
ascetics
reveals
our
shameful
kinship
with
the
beasts
be
it
so
one
can
bear
that
jealousy
is
the
real
shame
it
is
jealousy
not
love
that
connects
us
with
the
farmyard
intolerably
and
calls
up
visions
of
two
angry
cocks
and
a
complacent
hen
margaret
crushed
complacency
down
because
she
was
civilized
wilcox
uncivilized
continued
to
feel
anger
long
after
he
had
rebuilt
his
defences
and
was
again
presenting
a
bastion
to
the
world
miss
schlegel
you
a
pair
of
dear
creatures
but
you
really
must
be
careful
in
this
uncharitable
world
what
does
your
brother
say
i
forget
surely
he
has
some
opinion
he
laughs
if
i
remember
correctly
he
very
clever
is
he
said
evie
who
had
met
and
detested
tibby
at
oxford
yes
pretty
well
but
i
wonder
what
helen
doing
she
is
very
young
to
undertake
this
sort
of
thing
said
wilcox
margaret
went
out
into
the
landing
she
heard
no
sound
and
bast
topper
was
missing
from
the
hall
helen
she
called
yes
replied
a
voice
from
the
library
you
in
there
yes
he
gone
some
time
margaret
went
to
her
why
you
all
alone
she
said
yes
it
all
right
meg
poor
poor
creature
come
back
to
the
wilcoxes
and
tell
me
later
much
concerned
and
slightly
titillated
oh
i
no
patience
with
him
i
hate
him
poor
dear
bast
he
wanted
to
talk
literature
and
we
would
talk
business
such
a
muddle
of
a
man
and
yet
so
worth
pulling
through
i
like
him
well
done
said
margaret
kissing
her
but
come
into
the
now
and
do
talk
about
him
to
the
wilcoxes
make
light
of
the
whole
thing
helen
came
and
behaved
with
a
cheerfulness
that
reassured
their
visitor
this
hen
at
all
events
was
he
gone
with
my
blessing
she
cried
and
now
for
puppies
as
they
drove
away
wilcox
said
to
his
daughter
i
am
really
concerned
at
the
way
those
girls
go
on
they
are
as
clever
as
you
make
but
unpractical
god
bless
me
one
of
these
days
they
go
too
far
girls
like
that
ought
to
live
alone
in
london
until
they
marry
they
ought
to
have
someone
to
look
after
them
we
must
look
in
more
often
we
better
than
no
one
you
like
them
do
you
evie
evie
replied
helen
right
enough
but
i
ca
stand
the
toothy
one
and
i
should
have
called
either
of
them
girls
evie
had
grown
up
handsome
with
the
glow
of
youth
under
sunburn
built
firmly
and
she
was
the
best
the
wilcoxes
could
do
in
the
way
of
feminine
beauty
for
the
present
puppies
and
her
father
were
the
only
things
she
loved
but
the
net
of
matrimony
was
being
prepared
for
her
and
a
few
days
later
she
was
attracted
to
a
percy
cahill
an
uncle
of
charles
and
he
was
attracted
to
her
chapter
the
age
of
property
holds
bitter
moments
even
for
a
proprietor
when
a
move
is
imminent
furniture
becomes
ridiculous
and
margaret
now
lay
awake
at
nights
wondering
where
where
on
earth
they
and
all
their
belongings
would
be
deposited
in
september
next
chairs
tables
pictures
books
that
had
rumbled
down
to
them
through
the
generations
must
rumble
forward
again
like
a
slide
of
rubbish
to
which
she
longed
to
give
the
final
push
and
send
toppling
into
the
sea
but
there
were
all
their
books
they
never
read
them
but
they
were
their
father
and
must
be
kept
there
was
the
chiffonier
their
mother
had
set
store
by
it
they
could
not
remember
why
round
every
knob
and
cushion
in
the
house
sentiment
gathered
a
sentiment
that
was
at
times
personal
but
more
often
a
faint
piety
to
the
dead
a
prolongation
of
rites
that
might
have
ended
at
the
grave
it
was
absurd
if
you
came
to
think
of
it
helen
and
tibby
came
to
think
of
it
margaret
was
too
busy
with
the
the
feudal
ownership
of
land
did
bring
dignity
whereas
the
modern
ownership
of
movables
is
reducing
us
again
to
a
nomadic
horde
we
are
reverting
to
the
civilization
of
luggage
and
historians
of
the
future
will
note
how
the
middle
classes
accreted
possessions
without
taking
root
in
the
earth
and
may
find
in
this
the
secret
of
their
imaginative
poverty
the
schlegels
were
certainly
the
poorer
for
the
loss
of
wickham
place
it
had
helped
to
balance
their
lives
and
almost
to
counsel
them
nor
is
their
spiritually
the
richer
he
has
built
flats
on
its
site
his
grow
swifter
his
exposures
of
socialism
more
trenchant
but
he
has
spilt
the
precious
distillation
of
the
years
and
no
chemistry
of
his
can
give
it
back
to
society
again
margaret
grew
depressed
she
was
anxious
to
settle
on
a
house
before
they
left
town
to
pay
their
annual
visit
to
munt
she
enjoyed
this
visit
and
wanted
to
have
her
mind
at
ease
for
it
swanage
though
dull
was
stable
and
this
year
she
longed
more
than
usual
for
its
fresh
air
and
for
the
magnificent
downs
that
guard
it
on
the
north
but
london
thwarted
her
in
its
atmosphere
she
could
not
concentrate
london
only
stimulates
it
can
not
sustain
and
margaret
hurrying
over
its
surface
for
a
house
without
knowing
what
sort
of
a
house
she
wanted
was
paying
for
many
a
thrilling
sensation
in
the
past
she
could
not
even
break
loose
from
culture
and
her
time
was
wasted
by
concerts
which
it
would
be
a
sin
to
miss
and
invitations
which
it
would
never
do
to
refuse
at
last
she
grew
desperate
she
resolved
that
she
would
go
nowhere
and
be
at
home
to
no
one
until
she
found
a
house
and
broke
the
resolution
in
half
an
hour
once
she
had
humorously
lamented
that
she
had
never
been
to
simpson
restaurant
in
the
strand
now
a
note
arrived
from
miss
wilcox
asking
her
to
lunch
there
cahill
was
coming
and
the
three
would
have
such
a
jolly
chat
and
perhaps
end
up
at
the
hippodrome
margaret
had
no
strong
regard
for
evie
and
no
desire
to
meet
her
fiance
and
she
was
surprised
that
helen
who
had
been
far
funnier
about
simpson
had
not
been
asked
instead
but
the
invitation
touched
her
by
its
intimate
tone
she
must
know
evie
wilcox
better
than
she
supposed
and
declaring
that
she
simply
must
she
accepted
but
when
she
saw
evie
at
the
entrance
of
the
restaurant
staring
fiercely
at
nothing
after
the
fashion
of
athletic
women
her
heart
failed
her
anew
miss
wilcox
had
changed
perceptibly
since
her
engagement
her
voice
was
gruffer
her
manner
more
downright
and
she
was
inclined
to
patronize
the
more
foolish
virgin
margaret
was
silly
enough
to
be
pained
at
this
depressed
at
her
isolation
she
saw
not
only
houses
and
furniture
but
the
vessel
of
life
itself
slipping
past
her
with
people
like
evie
and
cahill
on
board
there
are
moments
when
virtue
and
wisdom
fail
us
and
one
of
them
came
to
her
at
simpson
in
the
strand
as
she
trod
the
staircase
narrow
but
carpeted
thickly
as
she
entered
the
where
saddles
of
mutton
were
being
trundled
up
to
expectant
clergymen
she
had
a
strong
if
erroneous
conviction
of
her
own
futility
and
wished
she
had
never
come
out
of
her
backwater
where
nothing
happened
except
art
and
literature
and
where
no
one
ever
got
married
or
succeeded
in
remaining
engaged
then
came
a
little
surprise
father
might
be
of
the
party
yes
father
was
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
she
moved
forward
to
greet
him
and
her
feeling
of
loneliness
vanished
i
thought
i
get
round
if
i
could
said
he
evie
told
me
of
her
little
plan
so
i
just
slipped
in
and
secured
a
table
always
secure
a
table
first
evie
do
pretend
you
want
to
sit
by
your
old
father
because
you
do
miss
schlegel
come
in
my
side
out
of
pity
my
goodness
but
you
look
tired
been
worrying
round
after
your
young
clerks
no
after
houses
said
margaret
edging
past
him
into
the
box
i
hungry
not
tired
i
want
to
eat
heaps
that
good
what
you
have
fish
pie
said
she
with
a
glance
at
the
menu
fish
pie
fancy
coming
for
fish
pie
to
simpson
it
not
a
bit
the
thing
to
go
for
go
for
something
for
me
then
said
margaret
pulling
off
her
gloves
her
spirits
were
rising
and
his
reference
to
leonard
bast
had
warmed
her
curiously
saddle
of
mutton
said
he
after
profound
reflection
and
cider
to
drink
that
the
type
of
thing
i
like
this
place
for
a
joke
once
in
a
way
it
is
so
thoroughly
old
english
do
you
agree
yes
said
margaret
who
did
the
order
was
given
the
joint
rolled
up
and
the
carver
under
direction
cut
the
meat
where
it
was
succulent
and
piled
their
plates
high
cahill
insisted
on
sirloin
but
admitted
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
later
on
he
and
evie
soon
fell
into
a
conversation
of
the
no
i
did
yes
you
did
type
conversation
which
though
fascinating
to
those
who
are
engaged
in
it
neither
desires
nor
deserves
the
attention
of
others
it
a
golden
rule
to
tip
the
carver
tip
my
motto
perhaps
it
does
make
life
more
human
then
the
fellows
know
one
again
especially
in
the
east
if
you
tip
they
remember
you
from
year
end
to
year
end
have
you
been
in
the
east
oh
greece
and
the
levant
i
used
to
go
out
for
sport
and
business
to
cyprus
some
military
society
of
a
sort
there
a
few
piastres
properly
distributed
help
to
keep
one
memory
green
but
you
of
course
think
this
shockingly
cynical
how
your
discussion
society
getting
on
any
new
utopias
lately
no
i
wilcox
as
i
already
told
you
once
do
you
know
of
any
houses
afraid
i
do
well
what
the
point
of
being
practical
if
you
find
two
distressed
females
a
house
we
merely
want
a
small
house
with
large
rooms
and
plenty
of
them
evie
i
like
that
miss
schlegel
expects
me
to
turn
house
agent
for
her
what
that
father
i
want
a
new
home
in
september
and
someone
must
find
it
i
ca
percy
do
you
know
of
anything
i
ca
say
i
do
said
cahill
how
like
you
you
never
any
good
never
any
good
just
listen
to
her
never
any
good
oh
come
well
you
are
miss
schlegel
is
he
the
torrent
of
their
love
having
splashed
these
drops
at
margaret
swept
away
on
its
habitual
course
she
sympathized
with
it
now
for
a
little
comfort
had
restored
her
geniality
speech
and
silence
pleased
her
equally
and
while
wilcox
made
some
preliminary
inquiries
about
cheese
her
eyes
surveyed
the
restaurant
and
admired
its
tributes
to
the
solidity
of
our
past
though
no
more
old
english
than
the
works
of
kipling
it
had
selected
its
reminiscences
so
adroitly
that
her
criticism
was
lulled
and
the
guests
whom
it
was
nourishing
for
imperial
purposes
bore
the
outer
semblance
of
parson
adams
or
tom
jones
scraps
of
their
talk
jarred
oddly
on
the
ear
right
you
are
i
cable
out
to
uganda
this
evening
came
from
the
table
behind
their
emperor
wants
war
well
let
him
have
it
was
the
opinion
of
a
clergyman
she
smiled
at
such
incongruities
next
time
she
said
to
wilcox
you
shall
come
to
lunch
with
me
at
eustace
miles
with
pleasure
no
you
hate
it
she
said
pushing
her
glass
towards
him
for
some
more
cider
it
all
proteids
and
and
people
come
up
to
you
and
beg
your
pardon
but
you
have
such
a
beautiful
aura
a
what
never
heard
of
an
aura
oh
happy
happy
man
i
scrub
at
mine
for
hours
nor
of
an
astral
plane
he
had
heard
of
astral
planes
and
censured
them
just
so
luckily
it
was
helen
aura
not
mine
and
she
had
to
chaperone
it
and
do
the
politenesses
i
just
sat
with
my
handkerchief
in
my
mouth
till
the
man
went
funny
experiences
seem
to
come
to
you
two
girls
no
one
ever
asked
me
about
my
what
d
call
it
perhaps
i
not
got
one
you
bound
to
have
one
but
it
may
be
such
a
terrible
colour
that
no
one
dares
mention
it
tell
me
though
miss
schlegel
do
you
really
believe
in
the
supernatural
and
all
that
too
difficult
a
question
why
that
gruyere
or
stilton
gruyere
please
better
have
stilton
stilton
because
though
i
do
believe
in
auras
and
think
theosophy
only
a
yet
there
may
be
something
in
it
all
the
same
he
concluded
with
a
frown
not
even
that
it
may
be
halfway
in
the
wrong
direction
i
ca
explain
i
do
believe
in
all
these
fads
and
yet
i
do
like
saying
that
i
do
believe
in
them
he
seemed
unsatisfied
and
said
so
you
would
give
me
your
word
that
you
do
hold
with
astral
bodies
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
could
said
margaret
surprised
that
the
point
was
of
any
importance
to
him
indeed
i
will
when
i
talked
about
scrubbing
my
aura
i
was
only
trying
to
be
funny
but
why
do
you
want
this
settled
i
do
know
now
wilcox
you
do
know
yes
i
am
no
you
not
burst
from
the
lovers
opposite
margaret
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
changed
the
subject
how
your
house
much
the
same
as
when
you
honoured
it
last
week
i
do
mean
ducie
street
howards
end
of
course
why
course
ca
you
turn
out
your
tenant
and
let
it
to
us
nearly
demented
let
me
think
i
wish
i
could
help
you
but
i
thought
you
wanted
to
be
in
town
one
bit
of
advice
fix
your
district
then
fix
your
price
and
then
do
budge
how
i
got
both
ducie
street
and
oniton
i
said
to
myself
mean
to
be
exactly
here
and
i
was
and
oniton
a
place
in
a
thousand
but
i
do
budge
gentlemen
seem
to
mesmerize
houses
cow
them
with
an
eye
and
up
they
come
trembling
ladies
ca
it
the
houses
that
are
mesmerizing
me
i
no
control
over
the
saucy
things
houses
are
alive
no
i
out
of
my
depth
he
said
and
added
did
you
talk
rather
like
that
to
your
office
boy
did
i
i
mean
i
did
more
or
less
i
talk
the
same
way
to
every
one
or
try
to
yes
i
know
and
how
much
do
you
suppose
that
he
understood
of
it
that
his
lookout
i
do
believe
in
suiting
my
conversation
to
my
company
one
can
doubtless
hit
upon
some
medium
of
exchange
that
seems
to
do
well
enough
but
it
no
more
like
the
real
thing
than
money
is
like
food
no
nourishment
in
it
you
pass
it
to
the
lower
classes
and
they
pass
it
back
to
you
and
this
you
call
intercourse
or
endeavour
when
it
mutual
priggishness
if
it
anything
our
friends
at
chelsea
see
this
they
say
one
ought
to
be
at
all
costs
intelligible
and
sacrifice
lower
classes
interrupted
wilcox
as
it
were
thrusting
his
hand
into
her
speech
well
you
do
admit
that
there
are
rich
and
poor
that
something
margaret
could
not
reply
was
he
incredibly
stupid
or
did
he
understand
her
better
than
she
understood
herself
you
do
admit
that
if
wealth
was
divided
up
equally
in
a
few
years
there
would
be
rich
and
poor
again
just
the
same
the
man
would
come
to
the
top
the
wastrel
sink
to
the
bottom
every
one
admits
that
your
socialists
do
my
socialists
do
yours
may
but
i
strongly
suspect
yours
of
being
not
socialists
but
ninepins
which
you
have
constructed
for
your
own
amusement
i
ca
imagine
any
living
creature
who
would
bowl
over
quite
so
easily
he
would
have
resented
this
had
she
not
been
a
woman
but
women
may
say
anything
it
was
one
of
his
holiest
beliefs
and
he
only
retorted
with
a
gay
smile
i
care
you
made
two
damaging
admissions
and
i
heartily
with
you
in
both
in
time
they
finished
lunch
and
margaret
who
had
excused
herself
from
the
hippodrome
took
her
leave
evie
had
scarcely
addressed
her
and
she
suspected
that
the
entertainment
had
been
planned
by
the
father
he
and
she
were
advancing
out
of
their
respective
families
towards
a
more
intimate
acquaintance
it
had
begun
long
ago
she
had
been
his
wife
friend
and
as
such
he
had
given
her
that
silver
vinaigrette
as
a
memento
it
was
pretty
of
him
to
have
given
that
vinaigrette
and
he
had
always
preferred
her
to
helen
unlike
most
men
but
the
advance
had
been
astonishing
lately
they
had
done
more
in
a
week
than
in
two
years
and
were
really
beginning
to
know
each
other
she
did
not
forget
his
promise
to
sample
eustace
miles
and
asked
him
as
soon
as
she
could
secure
tibby
as
his
chaperon
he
came
and
partook
of
dishes
with
humility
next
morning
the
schlegels
left
for
swanage
they
had
not
succeeded
in
finding
a
new
home
chapter
as
they
were
seated
at
aunt
juley
at
the
bays
parrying
her
excessive
hospitality
and
enjoying
the
view
of
the
bay
a
letter
came
for
margaret
and
threw
her
into
perturbation
it
was
from
wilcox
it
announced
an
important
change
in
his
plans
owing
to
evie
marriage
he
had
decided
to
give
up
his
house
in
ducie
street
and
was
willing
to
let
it
on
a
yearly
tenancy
it
was
a
businesslike
letter
and
stated
frankly
what
he
would
do
for
them
and
what
he
would
not
do
also
the
rent
if
they
approved
margaret
was
to
come
up
at
once
the
words
were
underlined
as
is
necessary
when
dealing
with
women
and
to
go
over
the
house
with
him
if
they
disapproved
a
wire
would
oblige
as
he
should
put
it
into
the
hands
of
an
agent
the
letter
perturbed
because
she
was
not
sure
what
it
meant
if
he
liked
her
if
he
had
manoeuvred
to
get
her
to
simpson
might
this
be
a
manoeuvre
to
get
her
to
london
and
result
in
an
offer
of
marriage
she
put
it
to
herself
as
indelicately
as
possible
in
the
hope
that
her
brain
would
cry
rubbish
you
a
fool
but
her
brain
only
tingled
a
little
and
was
silent
and
for
a
time
she
sat
gazing
at
the
mincing
waves
and
wondering
whether
the
news
would
seem
strange
to
the
others
as
soon
as
she
began
speaking
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
reassured
her
there
could
be
nothing
in
it
the
replies
also
were
typical
and
in
the
buff
of
conversation
her
fears
vanished
you
need
go
though
began
her
hostess
i
need
but
had
i
better
it
really
getting
rather
serious
we
let
chance
after
chance
slip
and
the
end
of
it
is
we
shall
be
bundled
out
bag
and
baggage
into
the
street
we
do
know
what
we
want
that
the
mischief
with
us
no
we
have
no
real
ties
said
helen
helping
herself
to
toast
sha
i
go
up
to
town
today
take
the
house
if
the
least
possible
and
then
come
down
by
the
afternoon
train
tomorrow
and
start
enjoying
myself
i
shall
be
no
fun
to
myself
or
to
others
until
this
business
is
off
my
mind
but
you
wo
do
anything
rash
margaret
there
nothing
rash
to
do
who
are
the
wilcoxes
said
tibby
a
question
that
sounds
silly
but
was
really
extremely
subtle
as
his
aunt
found
to
her
cost
when
she
tried
to
answer
it
i
manage
the
wilcoxes
i
do
see
where
they
come
in
no
more
do
i
agreed
helen
it
funny
that
we
just
do
lose
sight
of
them
out
of
all
our
hotel
acquaintances
wilcox
is
the
only
one
who
has
stuck
it
is
now
over
three
years
and
we
have
drifted
away
from
far
more
interesting
people
in
that
time
interesting
people
do
get
one
houses
meg
if
you
start
in
your
vein
i
shall
throw
the
treacle
at
you
it
a
better
vein
than
the
cosmopolitan
said
margaret
getting
up
now
children
which
is
it
to
be
you
know
the
ducie
street
house
shall
i
say
yes
or
shall
i
say
no
tibby
love
which
i
specially
anxious
to
pin
you
both
it
all
depends
what
meaning
you
attach
to
the
word
it
depends
on
nothing
of
the
sort
say
say
then
margaret
spoke
rather
seriously
i
think
she
said
that
our
race
is
degenerating
we
can
not
settle
even
this
little
thing
what
will
it
be
like
when
we
have
to
settle
a
big
one
it
will
be
as
easy
as
eating
returned
helen
i
was
thinking
of
father
how
could
he
settle
to
leave
germany
as
he
did
when
he
had
fought
for
it
as
a
young
man
and
all
his
feelings
and
friends
were
prussian
how
could
he
break
loose
with
patriotism
and
begin
aiming
at
something
else
it
would
have
killed
me
when
he
was
nearly
forty
he
could
change
countries
and
ideals
and
we
at
our
age
change
houses
it
humiliating
your
father
may
have
been
able
to
change
countries
said
munt
with
asperity
and
that
may
or
may
not
be
a
good
thing
but
he
could
change
houses
no
better
than
you
can
in
fact
much
worse
never
shall
i
forget
what
poor
emily
suffered
in
the
move
from
manchester
i
knew
it
cried
helen
i
told
you
so
it
is
the
little
things
one
bungles
at
the
big
real
ones
are
nothing
when
they
come
bungle
my
dear
you
are
too
little
to
recollect
in
fact
you
were
there
but
the
furniture
was
actually
in
the
vans
and
on
the
move
before
the
lease
for
wickham
place
was
signed
and
emily
took
train
with
baby
who
was
margaret
then
and
the
smaller
luggage
for
london
without
so
much
as
knowing
where
her
new
home
would
be
getting
away
from
that
house
may
be
hard
but
it
is
nothing
to
the
misery
that
we
all
went
through
getting
you
into
it
helen
with
her
mouth
full
cried
and
that
the
man
who
beat
the
austrians
and
the
danes
and
the
french
and
who
beat
the
germans
that
were
inside
himself
and
like
him
speak
for
yourself
said
tibby
remember
that
i
am
cosmopolitan
please
helen
may
be
right
of
course
she
right
said
helen
helen
might
be
right
but
she
did
not
go
up
to
london
margaret
did
that
an
interrupted
holiday
is
the
worst
of
the
minor
worries
and
one
may
be
pardoned
for
feeling
morbid
when
a
business
letter
snatches
one
away
from
the
sea
and
friends
she
could
not
believe
that
her
father
had
ever
felt
the
same
her
eyes
had
been
troubling
her
lately
so
that
she
could
not
read
in
the
train
and
it
bored
her
to
look
at
the
landscape
which
she
had
seen
but
yesterday
at
southampton
she
waved
to
frieda
frieda
was
on
her
way
down
to
join
them
at
swanage
and
munt
had
calculated
that
their
trains
would
cross
but
frieda
was
looking
the
other
way
and
margaret
travelled
on
to
town
feeling
solitary
and
how
like
an
old
maid
to
fancy
that
wilcox
was
courting
her
she
had
once
visited
a
spinster
poor
silly
and
unattractive
whose
mania
it
was
that
every
man
who
approached
her
fell
in
love
how
margaret
heart
had
bled
for
the
deluded
thing
how
she
had
lectured
reasoned
and
in
despair
acquiesced
i
may
have
been
deceived
by
the
curate
my
dear
but
the
young
fellow
who
brings
the
midday
post
really
is
fond
of
me
and
has
as
a
matter
fact
it
had
always
seemed
to
her
the
most
hideous
corner
of
old
age
yet
she
might
be
driven
into
it
herself
by
the
mere
pressure
of
virginity
wilcox
met
her
at
waterloo
himself
she
felt
certain
that
he
was
not
the
same
as
usual
for
one
thing
he
took
offence
at
everything
she
said
this
is
awfully
kind
of
you
she
began
but
afraid
it
not
going
to
do
the
house
has
not
been
built
that
suits
the
schlegel
family
what
have
you
come
up
determined
not
to
deal
not
exactly
not
exactly
in
that
case
let
be
starting
she
lingered
to
admire
the
motor
which
was
new
and
a
fairer
creature
than
the
vermilion
giant
that
had
borne
aunt
juley
to
her
doom
three
years
before
presumably
it
very
beautiful
she
said
how
do
you
like
it
crane
come
let
be
starting
repeated
her
host
how
on
earth
did
you
know
that
my
chauffeur
was
called
crane
why
i
know
crane
i
been
for
a
drive
with
evie
once
i
know
that
you
got
a
parlourmaid
called
milton
i
know
all
sorts
of
things
evie
he
echoed
in
injured
tones
you
wo
see
her
she
gone
out
with
cahill
it
no
fun
i
can
tell
you
being
left
so
much
alone
i
got
my
work
all
day
indeed
a
great
deal
too
much
of
it
but
when
i
come
home
in
the
evening
i
tell
you
i
ca
stand
the
house
in
my
absurd
way
i
lonely
too
margaret
replied
it
to
leave
one
old
home
i
scarcely
remember
anything
before
wickham
place
and
helen
and
tibby
were
born
there
helen
says
you
too
feel
lonely
horribly
hullo
parliament
back
wilcox
glanced
at
parliament
contemptuously
the
more
important
ropes
of
life
lay
elsewhere
yes
they
are
talking
again
said
he
but
you
were
going
to
say
only
some
rubbish
about
furniture
helen
says
it
alone
endures
while
men
and
houses
perish
and
that
in
the
end
the
world
will
be
a
desert
of
chairs
and
sofas
just
imagine
it
rolling
through
infinity
with
no
one
to
sit
upon
them
your
sister
always
likes
her
little
joke
she
says
my
brother
says
to
ducie
street
it
no
fun
helping
us
wilcox
i
assure
you
you
are
not
as
unpractical
as
you
pretend
i
shall
never
believe
it
margaret
laughed
but
she
was
quite
as
unpractical
she
could
not
concentrate
on
details
parliament
the
thames
the
irresponsive
chauffeur
would
flash
into
the
field
of
and
all
demand
some
comment
or
response
it
is
impossible
to
see
modern
life
steadily
and
see
it
whole
and
she
had
chosen
to
see
it
whole
wilcox
saw
steadily
he
never
bothered
over
the
mysterious
or
the
private
the
thames
might
run
inland
from
the
sea
the
chauffeur
might
conceal
all
passion
and
philosophy
beneath
his
unhealthy
skin
they
knew
their
own
business
and
he
knew
his
yet
she
liked
being
with
him
he
was
not
a
rebuke
but
a
stimulus
and
banished
morbidity
some
twenty
years
her
senior
he
preserved
a
gift
that
she
supposed
herself
to
have
already
lost
not
youth
creative
power
but
its
and
optimism
he
was
so
sure
that
it
was
a
very
pleasant
world
his
complexion
was
robust
his
hair
had
receded
but
not
thinned
the
thick
moustache
and
the
eyes
that
helen
had
compared
to
had
an
agreeable
menace
in
them
whether
they
were
turned
towards
the
slums
or
towards
the
stars
some
day
in
the
millennium
there
may
be
no
need
for
his
type
at
present
homage
is
due
to
it
from
those
who
think
themselves
superior
and
who
possibly
are
at
all
events
you
responded
to
my
telegram
promptly
he
remarked
oh
even
i
know
a
good
thing
when
i
see
it
i
glad
you
do
despise
the
goods
of
this
world
heavens
no
only
idiots
and
prigs
do
that
i
am
glad
very
glad
he
repeated
suddenly
softening
and
turning
to
her
as
if
the
remark
had
pleased
him
there
is
so
much
cant
talked
in
intellectual
circles
i
am
glad
you
do
share
it
is
all
very
well
as
a
means
of
strengthening
the
character
but
i
ca
stand
those
people
who
run
down
comforts
they
have
usually
some
axe
to
grind
can
you
comforts
are
of
two
kinds
said
margaret
who
was
keeping
herself
in
hand
those
we
can
share
with
others
like
fire
weather
or
music
and
those
we
ca
food
for
instance
it
depends
i
mean
reasonable
comforts
of
course
i
like
to
think
that
you
he
bent
nearer
the
sentence
died
unfinished
margaret
head
turned
very
stupid
and
the
inside
of
it
seemed
to
revolve
like
the
beacon
in
a
lighthouse
he
did
not
kiss
her
for
the
hour
was
twelve
and
the
car
was
passing
by
the
stables
of
buckingham
palace
but
the
atmosphere
was
so
charged
with
emotion
that
people
only
seemed
to
exist
on
her
account
and
she
was
surprised
that
crane
did
not
realize
this
and
turn
round
idiot
though
she
might
be
surely
wilcox
was
more
how
should
one
put
it
more
psychological
than
usual
always
a
good
judge
of
character
for
business
purposes
he
seemed
this
afternoon
to
enlarge
his
field
and
to
note
qualities
outside
neatness
obedience
and
decision
i
want
to
go
over
the
whole
house
she
announced
when
they
arrived
as
soon
as
i
get
back
to
swanage
which
will
be
tomorrow
afternoon
i
talk
it
over
once
more
with
helen
and
tibby
and
wire
you
or
right
the
and
they
began
their
survey
the
was
big
but
chelsea
would
have
moaned
aloud
wilcox
had
eschewed
those
decorative
schemes
that
wince
and
relent
and
refrain
and
achieve
beauty
by
sacrificing
comfort
and
pluck
after
so
much
and
margaret
viewed
with
relief
the
sumptuous
dado
the
frieze
the
gilded
amid
whose
foliage
parrots
sang
it
would
never
do
with
her
own
furniture
but
those
heavy
chairs
that
immense
loaded
with
presentation
plate
stood
up
against
its
pressure
like
men
the
room
suggested
men
and
margaret
keen
to
derive
the
modern
capitalist
from
the
warriors
and
hunters
of
the
past
saw
it
as
an
ancient
where
the
lord
sat
at
meat
among
his
thanes
even
the
bible
the
dutch
bible
that
charles
had
brought
back
from
the
boer
war
fell
into
position
such
a
room
admitted
loot
now
the
the
was
paved
here
we
fellows
smoke
we
fellows
smoked
in
chairs
of
maroon
leather
it
was
as
if
a
had
spawned
oh
jolly
said
margaret
sinking
into
one
of
them
you
do
like
it
he
said
fixing
his
eyes
on
her
upturned
face
and
surely
betraying
an
almost
intimate
note
it
all
rubbish
not
making
oneself
comfortable
is
it
are
those
cruikshanks
gillrays
shall
we
go
on
upstairs
does
all
this
furniture
come
from
howards
end
the
howards
end
furniture
has
all
gone
to
oniton
does
however
i
concerned
with
the
house
not
the
furniture
how
big
is
this
thirty
by
fifteen
no
wait
a
minute
fifteen
and
a
half
ah
well
wilcox
are
you
ever
amused
at
the
solemnity
with
which
we
middle
classes
approach
the
subject
of
houses
they
proceeded
to
the
chelsea
managed
better
here
it
was
sallow
and
ineffective
one
could
visualize
the
ladies
withdrawing
to
it
while
their
lords
discussed
life
realities
below
to
the
accompaniment
of
cigars
had
wilcox
looked
thus
at
howards
end
just
as
this
thought
entered
margaret
brain
wilcox
did
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
and
the
knowledge
that
she
had
been
right
so
overcame
her
that
she
nearly
fainted
but
the
proposal
was
not
to
rank
among
the
world
great
love
scenes
miss
schlegel
his
voice
was
firm
i
have
had
you
up
on
false
pretences
i
want
to
speak
about
a
much
more
serious
matter
than
a
house
margaret
almost
answered
i
know
could
you
be
induced
to
share
my
is
it
probable
oh
mr
wilcox
she
interrupted
holding
the
piano
and
averting
her
eyes
i
see
i
see
i
will
write
to
you
afterwards
if
i
may
he
began
to
stammer
miss
schlegel
margaret
you
do
understand
oh
yes
indeed
yes
said
margaret
i
am
asking
you
to
be
my
wife
so
deep
already
was
her
sympathy
that
when
he
said
i
am
asking
you
to
be
my
wife
she
made
herself
give
a
little
start
she
must
show
surprise
if
he
expected
it
an
immense
joy
came
over
her
it
was
indescribable
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
humanity
and
most
resembled
the
happiness
of
fine
weather
fine
weather
is
due
to
the
sun
but
margaret
could
think
of
no
central
radiance
here
she
stood
in
his
happy
and
longing
to
give
happiness
on
leaving
him
she
realized
that
the
central
radiance
had
been
love
you
are
offended
miss
schlegel
how
could
i
be
offended
there
was
a
moment
pause
he
was
anxious
to
get
rid
of
her
and
she
knew
it
she
had
too
much
intuition
to
look
at
him
as
he
struggled
for
possessions
that
money
can
not
buy
he
desired
comradeship
and
affection
but
he
feared
them
and
she
who
had
taught
herself
only
to
desire
and
could
have
clothed
the
struggle
with
beauty
held
back
and
hesitated
with
him
she
continued
you
will
have
a
letter
from
me
i
am
going
back
to
swanage
tomorrow
thank
you
and
it
you
i
thank
i
may
order
the
motor
round
may
i
that
would
be
most
kind
i
wish
i
had
written
instead
ought
i
to
have
written
not
at
all
there
just
one
question
she
shook
her
head
he
looked
a
little
bewildered
and
they
parted
they
parted
without
shaking
hands
she
had
kept
the
interview
for
his
sake
in
tints
of
the
quietest
grey
yet
she
thrilled
with
happiness
ere
she
reached
her
own
house
others
had
loved
her
in
the
past
if
one
may
apply
to
their
brief
desires
so
grave
a
word
but
those
others
had
been
ninnies
young
men
who
had
nothing
to
do
old
men
who
could
find
nobody
better
and
she
had
often
loved
too
but
only
so
far
as
the
facts
of
sex
demanded
mere
yearnings
for
the
masculine
to
be
dismissed
for
what
they
were
worth
with
a
smile
never
before
had
her
personality
been
touched
she
was
not
young
or
very
rich
and
it
amazed
her
that
a
man
of
any
standing
should
take
her
seriously
as
she
sat
trying
to
do
accounts
in
her
empty
house
amidst
beautiful
pictures
and
noble
books
waves
of
emotion
broke
as
if
a
tide
of
passion
was
flowing
through
the
night
air
she
shook
her
head
tried
to
concentrate
her
attention
and
failed
in
vain
did
she
repeat
but
i
been
through
this
sort
of
thing
before
she
had
never
been
through
it
the
big
machinery
as
opposed
to
the
little
had
been
set
in
motion
and
the
idea
that
wilcox
loved
obsessed
her
before
she
came
to
love
him
in
return
she
would
come
to
no
decision
yet
oh
sir
this
is
so
sudden
that
prudish
phrase
exactly
expressed
her
when
her
time
came
premonitions
are
not
preparation
she
must
examine
more
closely
her
own
nature
and
his
she
must
talk
it
over
judicially
with
helen
it
had
been
a
strange
the
central
radiance
unacknowledged
from
first
to
last
she
in
his
place
would
have
said
ich
liebe
dich
but
perhaps
it
was
not
his
habit
to
open
the
heart
he
might
have
done
it
if
she
had
pressed
him
as
a
matter
of
duty
perhaps
england
expects
every
man
to
open
his
heart
once
but
the
effort
would
have
jarred
him
and
never
if
she
could
avoid
it
should
he
lose
those
defences
that
he
had
chosen
to
raise
against
the
world
he
must
never
be
bothered
with
emotional
talk
or
with
a
display
of
sympathy
he
was
an
elderly
man
now
and
it
would
be
futile
and
impudent
to
correct
him
wilcox
strayed
in
and
out
ever
a
welcome
ghost
surveying
the
scene
thought
margaret
without
one
hint
of
bitterness
chapter
if
one
wanted
to
show
a
foreigner
england
perhaps
the
wisest
course
would
be
to
take
him
to
the
final
section
of
the
purbeck
hills
and
stand
him
on
their
summit
a
few
miles
to
the
east
of
corfe
then
system
after
system
of
our
island
would
roll
together
under
his
feet
beneath
him
is
the
valley
of
the
frome
and
all
the
wild
lands
that
come
tossing
down
from
dorchester
black
and
gold
to
mirror
their
gorse
in
the
expanses
of
poole
the
valley
of
the
stour
is
beyond
unaccountable
stream
dirty
at
blandford
pure
at
wimborne
the
stour
sliding
out
of
fat
fields
to
marry
the
avon
beneath
the
tower
of
christchurch
the
valley
of
the
avon
invisible
but
far
to
the
north
the
trained
eye
may
see
clearbury
ring
that
guards
it
and
the
imagination
may
leap
beyond
that
on
to
salisbury
plain
itself
and
beyond
the
plain
to
all
the
glorious
downs
of
central
england
nor
is
suburbia
absent
ignoble
coast
cowers
to
the
right
heralding
the
that

for
all
their
beauty
red
houses
and
the
stock
exchange
and
extend
to
the
gates
of
london
itself
so
tremendous
is
the
city
trail
but
the
cliffs
of
freshwater
it
shall
never
touch
and
the
island
will
guard
the
island
purity
till
the
end
of
time
seen
from
the
west
the
wight
is
beautiful
beyond
all
laws
of
beauty
it
is
as
if
a
fragment
of
england
floated
forward
to
greet
the
foreigner
chalk
of
our
chalk
turf
of
our
turf
epitome
of
what
will
follow
and
behind
the
fragment
lies
southampton
hostess
to
the
nations
and
portsmouth
a
latent
fire
and
all
around
it
with
double
and
treble
collision
of
tides
swirls
the
sea
how
many
villages
appear
in
this
view
how
many
castles
how
many
churches
vanished
or
triumphant
how
many
ships
railways
and
roads
what
incredible
variety
of
men
working
beneath
that
lucent
sky
to
what
final
end
the
reason
fails
like
a
wave
on
the
swanage
beach
the
imagination
swells
spreads
and
deepens
until
it
becomes
geographic
and
encircles
england
so
frieda
mosebach
now
frau
architect
liesecke
and
mother
to
her
husband
baby
was
brought
up
to
these
heights
to
be
impressed
and
after
a
prolonged
gaze
she
said
that
the
hills
were
more
swelling
here
than
in
pomerania
which
was
true
but
did
not
seem
to
munt
apposite
poole
harbour
was
dry
which
led
her
to
praise
the
absence
of
muddy
foreshore
at
friedrich
wilhelms
bad
rugen
where
hang
over
the
tideless
baltic
and
cows
may
contemplate
the
brine
rather
unhealthy
munt
thought
this
would
be
water
being
safer
when
it
moved
about
and
your
english
lakes
vindermere
grasmere
are
they
then
unhealthy
no
frau
liesecke
but
that
is
because
they
are
fresh
water
and
different
salt
water
ought
to
have
tides
and
go
up
and
down
a
great
deal
or
else
it
smells
look
for
instance
at
an
aquarium
an
aquarium
oh
meesis
munt
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
fresh
aquariums
stink
less
than
salt
why
when
victor
my
collected
many
tadpoles
you
are
not
to
say
interrupted
helen
at
least
you
may
say
it
but
you
must
pretend
you
are
being
funny
while
you
say
it
then
and
the
mud
of
your
pool
down
there
does
it
not
smell
or
may
i
say
ha
ha
there
always
has
been
mud
in
poole
harbour
said
munt
with
a
slight
frown
the
rivers
bring
it
down
and
a
most
valuable
depends
upon
it
yes
that
is
so
conceded
frieda
and
another
international
incident
was
closed
is
resumed
their
hostess
quoting
a
local
rhyme
to
which
she
was
much
attached
is
poole
was
and
swanage
is
to
be
the
most
important
town
of
all
and
biggest
of
the
three
now
frau
liesecke
i
have
shown
you
bournemouth
and
i
have
shown
you
poole
so
let
us
walk
backward
a
little
and
look
down
again
at
swanage
aunt
juley
would
that
be
meg
train
a
tiny
puff
of
smoke
had
been
circling
the
harbour
and
now
was
bearing
southwards
towards
them
over
the
black
and
the
gold
oh
dearest
margaret
i
do
hope
she
wo
be
overtired
oh
i
do
wonder
i
do
wonder
whether
she
taken
the
house
i
hope
she
has
been
hasty
so
do
i
oh
so
do
i
will
it
be
as
beautiful
as
wickham
place
frieda
asked
i
should
think
it
would
trust
wilcox
for
doing
himself
proud
all
those
ducie
street
houses
are
beautiful
in
their
modern
way
and
i
ca
think
why
he
does
keep
on
with
it
but
it
really
for
evie
that
he
went
there
and
now
that
evie
going
to
be
married
ah
you
never
seen
miss
wilcox
frieda
how
absurdly
matrimonial
you
are
but
sister
to
that
paul
yes
and
to
that
charles
said
munt
with
feeling
oh
helen
helen
what
a
time
that
was
helen
laughed
meg
and
i
have
got
such
tender
hearts
if
there
a
chance
of
a
cheap
house
we
go
for
it
now
look
frau
liesecke
at
my
niece
train
you
see
it
is
coming
towards
us
coming
coming
and
when
it
gets
to
corfe
it
will
actually
go
through
the
downs
on
which
we
are
standing
so
that
if
we
walk
over
as
i
suggested
and
look
down
on
swanage
we
shall
see
it
coming
on
the
other
side
shall
we
frieda
assented
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
crossed
the
ridge
and
exchanged
the
greater
view
for
the
lesser
rather
a
dull
valley
lay
below
backed
by
the
slope
of
the
coastward
downs
they
were
looking
across
the
isle
of
purbeck
and
on
to
swanage
soon
to
be
the
most
important
town
of
all
and
ugliest
of
the
three
margaret
train
reappeared
as
promised
and
was
greeted
with
approval
by
her
aunt
it
came
to
a
standstill
in
the
middle
distance
and
there
it
had
been
planned
that
tibby
should
meet
her
and
drive
her
and
a
up
to
join
them
you
see
continued
helen
to
her
cousin
the
wilcoxes
collect
houses
as
your
victor
collects
tadpoles
they
have
one
ducie
street
two
howards
end
where
my
great
rumpus
was
three
a
country
seat
in
shropshire
four
charles
has
a
house
in
hilton
and
five
another
near
epsom
and
six
evie
will
have
a
house
when
she
marries
and
probably
a
in
the
country
which
makes
seven
oh
yes
and
paul
a
hut
in
africa
makes
eight
i
wish
we
could
get
howards
end
that
was
something
like
a
dear
little
house
did
you
think
so
aunt
juley
i
had
too
much
to
do
dear
to
look
at
it
said
munt
with
a
gracious
dignity
i
had
everything
to
settle
and
explain
and
charles
wilcox
to
keep
in
his
place
besides
it
is
likely
i
should
remember
much
i
just
remember
having
lunch
in
your
bedroom
yes
so
do
i
but
oh
dear
dear
how
dead
it
all
seems
and
in
the
autumn
there
began
this
movement
you
and
frieda
and
meg
and
wilcox
all
obsessed
with
the
idea
that
i
might
yet
marry
paul
you
yet
may
said
frieda
despondently
helen
shook
her
head
the
great
wilcox
peril
will
never
return
if
i
certain
of
anything
it
of
that
one
is
certain
of
nothing
but
the
truth
of
one
own
emotions
the
remark
fell
damply
on
the
conversation
but
helen
slipped
her
arm
round
her
cousin
somehow
liking
her
the
better
for
making
it
it
was
not
an
original
remark
nor
had
frieda
appropriated
it
passionately
for
she
had
a
patriotic
rather
than
a
philosophic
mind
yet
it
betrayed
that
interest
in
the
universal
which
the
average
teuton
possesses
and
the
average
englishman
does
not
it
was
however
illogically
the
good
the
beautiful
the
true
as
opposed
to
the
respectable
the
pretty
the
adequate
it
was
a
landscape
of
bocklin
beside
a
landscape
of
leader
strident
and
but
quivering
into
supernatural
life
it
sharpened
idealism
stirred
the
soul
it
may
have
been
a
bad
preparation
for
what
followed
look
cried
aunt
juley
hurrying
away
from
generalities
over
the
narrow
summit
of
the
down
stand
where
i
stand
and
you
will
see
the
coming
i
see
the
coming
they
stood
and
saw
the
coming
margaret
and
tibby
were
presently
seen
coming
in
it
leaving
the
outskirts
of
swanage
it
drove
for
a
little
through
the
budding
lanes
and
then
began
the
ascent
have
you
got
the
house
they
shouted
long
before
she
could
possibly
hear
helen
ran
down
to
meet
her
the
highroad
passed
over
a
saddle
and
a
track
went
thence
at
right
angles
along
the
ridge
of
the
down
have
you
got
the
house
margaret
shook
her
head
oh
what
a
nuisance
so
we
as
we
were
not
exactly
she
got
out
looking
tired
some
mystery
said
tibby
we
are
to
be
enlightened
presently
margaret
came
close
up
to
her
and
whispered
that
she
had
had
a
proposal
of
marriage
from
wilcox
helen
was
amused
she
opened
the
gate
on
to
the
downs
so
that
her
brother
might
lead
the
pony
through
it
just
like
a
widower
she
remarked
they
cheek
enough
for
anything
and
invariably
select
one
of
their
first
wife
friends
margaret
face
flashed
despair
that
type
she
broke
off
with
a
cry
meg
not
anything
wrong
with
you
wait
one
minute
said
margaret
whispering
always
but
you
never
conceivably
you
never
she
pulled
herself
together
tibby
hurry
up
through
i
hold
this
gate
indefinitely
aunt
juley
i
say
aunt
juley
make
the
tea
will
you
and
frieda
we
got
to
talk
houses
and
i
come
on
afterwards
and
then
turning
her
face
to
her
sister
she
burst
into
tears
margaret
was
stupefied
she
heard
herself
saying
oh
really
she
felt
herself
touched
with
a
hand
that
trembled
do
sobbed
helen
do
do
meg
do
she
seemed
incapable
of
saying
any
other
word
margaret
trembling
herself
led
her
forward
up
the
road
till
they
strayed
through
another
gate
on
to
the
down
do
do
do
such
a
thing
i
tell
you
not
to
do
i
know
do
what
do
you
know
panic
and
emptiness
sobbed
helen
do
then
margaret
thought
helen
is
a
little
selfish
i
have
never
behaved
like
this
when
there
has
seemed
a
chance
of
her
marrying
she
said
but
we
would
still
see
each
other
very
often
and
it
not
a
thing
like
that
sobbed
helen
and
she
broke
right
away
and
wandered
distractedly
upwards
stretching
her
hands
towards
the
view
and
crying
what
happened
to
you
called
margaret
following
through
the
wind
that
gathers
at
sundown
on
the
northern
slopes
of
hills
but
it
stupid
and
suddenly
stupidity
seized
her
and
the
immense
landscape
was
blurred
but
helen
turned
meg
i
do
know
what
happened
to
either
of
us
said
margaret
wiping
her
eyes
we
must
both
have
gone
mad
then
helen
wiped
hers
and
they
even
laughed
a
little
look
here
sit
down
all
right
i
sit
down
if
you
sit
down
there
one
kiss
now
whatever
whatever
is
the
matter
i
do
mean
what
i
said
do
it
would
do
oh
helen
stop
saying
it
ignorant
as
if
your
head
was
out
of
the
slime
is
probably
what
bast
says
all
the
day
to
mr
bast
helen
was
silent
well
tell
me
about
it
first
and
meanwhile
perhaps
i
have
got
my
head
out
of
the
slime
that
better
well
where
shall
i
begin
when
i
arrived
at
waterloo
no
i
go
back
before
that
because
i
anxious
you
should
know
everything
from
the
first
the
was
about
ten
days
ago
it
was
the
day
bast
came
to
tea
and
lost
his
temper
i
was
defending
him
and
wilcox
became
jealous
about
me
however
slightly
i
thought
it
was
the
involuntary
thing
which
men
ca
help
any
more
than
we
can
you
know
at
least
i
know
in
my
own
case
when
a
man
has
said
to
me
a
pretty
girl
i
am
seized
with
a
momentary
sourness
against
and
long
to
tweak
her
ear
it
a
tiresome
feeling
but
not
an
important
one
and
one
easily
manages
it
but
it
was
only
this
in
wilcox
case
i
gather
now
then
you
love
him
margaret
considered
it
is
wonderful
knowing
that
a
real
man
cares
for
you
she
said
the
mere
fact
of
that
grows
more
tremendous
remember
i
known
and
liked
him
steadily
for
nearly
three
years
but
loved
him
margaret
peered
into
her
past
it
is
pleasant
to
analyze
feelings
while
they
are
still
only
feelings
and
unembodied
in
the
social
fabric
with
her
arm
round
helen
and
her
eyes
shifting
over
the
view
as
if
this
county
or
that
could
reveal
the
secret
of
her
own
heart
she
meditated
honestly
and
said
no
but
you
will
yes
said
margaret
of
that
i
pretty
sure
indeed
i
began
the
moment
he
spoke
to
me
and
have
settled
to
marry
him
i
had
but
am
wanting
a
long
talk
about
it
now
what
is
it
against
him
helen
you
must
try
and
say
helen
in
her
turn
looked
outwards
it
is
ever
since
paul
she
said
finally
but
what
has
wilcox
to
do
with
paul
but
he
was
there
they
were
all
there
that
morning
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
and
saw
that
paul
was
frightened
the
man
who
loved
me
frightened
and
all
his
paraphernalia
fallen
so
that
i
knew
it
was
impossible
because
personal
relations
are
the
important
thing
for
ever
and
ever
and
not
this
outer
life
of
telegrams
and
anger
she
poured
the
sentence
forth
in
one
breath
but
her
sister
understood
it
because
it
touched
on
thoughts
that
were
familiar
between
them
that
foolish
in
the
first
place
i
disagree
about
the
outer
life
well
we
often
argued
that
the
real
point
is
that
there
is
the
widest
gulf
between
my
and
yours
yours
was
romance
mine
will
be
prose
i
not
running
it
down
a
very
good
kind
of
prose
but
well
considered
well
thought
out
for
instance
i
know
all
wilcox
faults
he
afraid
of
emotion
he
cares
too
much
about
success
too
little
about
the
past
his
sympathy
lacks
poetry
and
so
is
sympathy
really
even
say
she
looked
at
the
shining
lagoons
that
spiritually
he
not
as
honest
as
i
am
does
that
satisfy
you
no
it
does
said
helen
it
makes
me
feel
worse
and
worse
you
must
be
mad
margaret
made
a
movement
of
irritation
i
do
intend
him
or
any
man
or
any
woman
to
be
all
my
life
good
heavens
no
there
are
heaps
of
things
in
me
that
he
does
and
shall
never
understand
thus
she
spoke
before
the
wedding
ceremony
and
the
physical
union
before
the
astonishing
glass
shade
had
fallen
that
interposes
between
married
couples
and
the
world
she
was
to
keep
her
independence
more
than
do
most
women
as
yet
marriage
was
to
alter
her
fortunes
rather
than
her
character
and
she
was
not
far
wrong
in
boasting
that
she
understood
her
future
husband
yet
he
did
alter
her
character
a
little
there
was
an
unforeseen
surprise
a
cessation
of
the
winds
and
odours
of
life
a
social
pressure
that
would
have
her
think
conjugally
so
with
him
she
continued
there
are
heaps
of
things
in
him
more
especially
things
that
he
does
that
will
always
be
hidden
from
me
he
has
all
those
public
qualities
which
you
so
despise
and
enable
all
this
she
waved
her
hand
at
the
landscape
which
confirmed
anything
if
wilcoxes
had
worked
and
died
in
england
for
thousands
of
years
you
and
i
could
sit
here
without
having
our
throats
cut
there
would
be
no
trains
no
ships
to
carry
us
literary
people
about
in
no
fields
even
just
savagery
no
perhaps
not
even
that
without
their
spirit
life
might
never
have
moved
out
of
protoplasm
more
and
more
do
i
refuse
to
draw
my
income
and
sneer
at
those
who
guarantee
it
there
are
times
when
it
seems
to
me
and
to
me
and
to
all
women
so
one
kissed
paul
that
brutal
said
margaret
mine
is
an
absolutely
different
case
i
thought
things
out
it
makes
no
difference
thinking
things
out
they
come
to
the
same
rubbish
there
was
a
long
silence
during
which
the
tide
returned
into
poole
harbour
one
would
lose
something
murmured
helen
apparently
to
herself
the
water
crept
over
the
towards
the
gorse
and
the
blackened
heather
branksea
island
lost
its
immense
foreshores
and
became
a
sombre
episode
of
trees
frome
was
forced
inward
towards
dorchester
stour
against
wimborne
avon
towards
salisbury
and
over
the
immense
displacement
the
sun
presided
leading
it
to
triumph
ere
he
sank
to
rest
england
was
alive
throbbing
through
all
her
estuaries
crying
for
joy
through
the
mouths
of
all
her
gulls
and
the
north
wind
with
contrary
motion
blew
stronger
against
her
rising
seas
what
did
it
mean
for
what
end
are
her
fair
complexities
her
changes
of
soil
her
sinuous
coast
does
she
belong
to
those
who
have
moulded
her
and
made
her
feared
by
other
lands
or
to
those
who
have
added
nothing
to
her
power
but
have
somehow
seen
her
seen
the
whole
island
at
once
lying
as
a
jewel
in
a
silver
sea
sailing
as
a
ship
of
souls
with
all
the
brave
world
fleet
accompanying
her
towards
eternity
chapter
margaret
had
often
wondered
at
the
disturbance
that
takes
place
in
the
world
waters
when
love
who
seems
so
tiny
a
pebble
slips
in
whom
does
love
concern
beyond
the
beloved
and
the
lover
yet
his
impact
deluges
a
hundred
shores
no
doubt
the
disturbance
is
really
the
spirit
of
the
generations
welcoming
the
new
generation
and
chafing
against
the
ultimate
fate
who
holds
all
the
seas
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
but
love
can
not
understand
this
he
can
not
comprehend
another
infinity
he
is
conscious
only
of
his
own
flying
sunbeam
falling
rose
pebble
that
asks
for
one
quiet
plunge
below
the
fretting
interplay
of
space
and
time
he
knows
that
he
will
survive
at
the
end
of
things
and
be
gathered
by
fate
as
a
jewel
from
the
slime
and
be
handed
with
admiration
round
the
assembly
of
the
gods
men
did
produce
this
they
will
say
and
saying
they
will
give
men
immortality
but
meanwhile
what
agitations
meanwhile
the
foundations
of
property
and
propriety
are
laid
bare
twin
rocks
family
pride
flounders
to
the
surface
puffing
and
blowing
and
refusing
to
be
comforted
theology
vaguely
ascetic
gets
up
a
nasty
ground
swell
then
the
lawyers
are
aroused
cold
brood
and
creep
out
of
their
holes
they
do
what
they
can
they
tidy
up
property
and
propriety
reassure
theology
and
family
pride
are
poured
on
the
troubled
waters
the
lawyers
creep
back
and
if
all
has
gone
well
love
joins
one
man
and
woman
together
in
matrimony
margaret
had
expected
the
disturbance
and
was
not
irritated
by
it
for
a
sensitive
woman
she
had
steady
nerves
and
could
bear
with
the
incongruous
and
the
grotesque
and
besides
there
was
nothing
excessive
about
her
was
the
dominant
note
of
her
relations
with
wilcox
or
as
i
must
now
call
him
henry
henry
did
not
encourage
romance
and
she
was
no
girl
to
fidget
for
it
an
acquaintance
had
become
a
lover
might
become
a
husband
but
would
retain
all
that
she
had
noted
in
the
acquaintance
and
love
must
confirm
an
old
relation
rather
than
reveal
a
new
one
in
this
spirit
she
promised
to
marry
him
he
was
in
swanage
on
the
morrow
bearing
the
they
greeted
one
another
with
a
hearty
cordiality
that
impressed
aunt
juley
henry
dined
at
the
bays
but
he
had
engaged
a
bedroom
in
the
principal
hotel
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
knew
the
principal
hotel
by
instinct
after
dinner
he
asked
margaret
if
she
care
for
a
turn
on
the
parade
she
accepted
and
could
not
repress
a
little
tremor
it
would
be
her
first
real
love
scene
but
as
she
put
on
her
hat
she
burst
out
laughing
love
was
so
unlike
the
article
served
up
in
books
the
joy
though
genuine
was
different
the
mystery
an
unexpected
mystery
for
one
thing
wilcox
still
seemed
a
stranger
for
a
time
they
talked
about
the
ring
then
she
said
do
you
remember
the
embankment
at
chelsea
it
ca
be
ten
days
ago
yes
he
said
laughing
and
you
and
your
sister
were
head
and
ears
deep
in
some
quixotic
scheme
ah
well
i
little
thought
then
certainly
did
you
i
do
know
about
that
i
should
like
to
say
why
was
it
earlier
she
cried
did
you
think
of
me
this
way
earlier
how
extraordinarily
interesting
henry
tell
me
but
henry
had
no
intention
of
telling
perhaps
he
could
not
have
told
for
his
mental
states
became
obscure
as
soon
as
he
had
passed
through
them
he
misliked
the
very
word
interesting
connoting
it
with
wasted
energy
and
even
with
morbidity
hard
facts
were
enough
for
him
i
did
think
of
it
she
pursued
no
when
you
spoke
to
me
in
the
that
was
practically
the
first
it
was
all
so
different
from
what
it
supposed
to
be
on
the
stage
or
in
books
a
proposal
is
how
shall
i
put
it
a
affair
a
kind
of
bouquet
it
loses
its
literal
meaning
but
in
life
a
proposal
really
is
a
proposal
by
the
way
a
suggestion
a
seed
she
concluded
and
the
thought
flew
away
into
darkness
i
was
thinking
if
you
did
mind
that
we
ought
to
spend
this
evening
in
a
business
talk
there
will
be
so
much
to
settle
i
think
so
too
tell
me
in
the
first
place
how
did
you
get
on
with
tibby
with
your
brother
yes
during
cigarettes
oh
very
well
i
am
so
glad
she
answered
a
little
surprised
what
did
you
talk
about
me
presumably
about
greece
too
greece
was
a
very
good
card
henry
tibby
only
a
boy
still
and
one
has
to
pick
and
choose
subjects
a
little
well
done
i
was
telling
him
i
have
shares
in
a
near
calamata
what
a
delightful
thing
to
have
shares
in
ca
we
go
there
for
our
honeymoon
what
to
do
to
eat
the
currants
and
is
there
marvellous
scenery
moderately
but
it
not
the
kind
of
place
one
could
possibly
go
to
with
a
lady
why
not
no
hotels
some
ladies
do
without
hotels
are
you
aware
that
helen
and
i
have
walked
alone
over
the
apennines
with
our
luggage
on
our
backs
i
was
aware
and
if
i
can
manage
it
you
will
never
do
such
a
thing
again
she
said
more
gravely
you
have
found
time
for
a
talk
with
helen
yet
i
suppose
no
do
before
you
go
i
am
so
anxious
you
two
should
be
friends
your
sister
and
i
have
always
hit
it
off
he
said
negligently
but
we
drifting
away
from
our
business
let
me
begin
at
the
beginning
you
know
that
evie
is
going
to
marry
percy
cahill
dolly
uncle
exactly
the
girl
madly
in
love
with
him
a
very
good
sort
of
fellow
but
he
demands
and
rightly
a
suitable
provision
with
her
and
in
the
second
place
you
will
naturally
understand
there
is
charles
before
leaving
town
i
wrote
charles
a
very
careful
letter
you
see
he
has
an
increasing
family
and
increasing
expenses
and
the
and
is
nothing
particular
just
now
though
capable
of
development
poor
fellow
murmured
margaret
looking
out
to
sea
and
not
understanding
charles
being
the
elder
son
some
day
charles
will
have
howards
end
but
i
am
anxious
in
my
own
happiness
not
to
be
unjust
to
others
of
course
not
she
began
and
then
gave
a
little
cry
you
mean
money
how
stupid
i
am
of
course
not
oddly
enough
he
winced
a
little
at
the
word
yes
money
since
you
put
it
so
frankly
i
am
determined
to
be
just
to
all
just
to
you
just
to
them
i
am
determined
that
my
children
shall
have
no
case
against
me
be
generous
to
them
she
said
sharply
bother
justice
i
am
determined
and
have
already
written
to
charles
to
that
effect
but
how
much
have
you
got
what
how
much
have
you
a
year
i
six
hundred
my
income
yes
we
must
begin
with
how
much
you
have
before
we
can
settle
how
much
you
can
give
charles
justice
and
even
generosity
depend
on
that
i
must
say
you
a
downright
young
woman
he
observed
patting
her
arm
and
laughing
a
little
what
a
question
to
spring
on
a
fellow
do
you
know
your
income
or
do
you
want
to
tell
it
me
i
that
all
right
now
she
patted
him
do
tell
me
i
do
want
to
know
i
can
do
the
sum
just
as
well
by
proportion
divide
your
income
into
ten
parts
how
many
parts
would
you
give
to
evie
how
many
to
charles
how
many
to
paul
the
fact
is
my
dear
i
had
any
intention
of
bothering
you
with
details
i
only
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
well
that
something
must
be
done
for
the
others
and
you
understood
me
perfectly
so
let
pass
on
to
the
next
point
yes
we
settled
that
said
margaret
undisturbed
by
his
strategic
blunderings
go
ahead
give
away
all
you
can
bearing
in
mind
i
a
clear
six
hundred
what
a
mercy
it
is
to
have
all
this
money
about
one
we
none
too
much
i
assure
you
you
marrying
a
poor
man
helen
would
agree
with
me
here
she
continued
helen
dare
slang
the
rich
being
rich
herself
but
she
would
like
to
there
an
odd
notion
that
i
have
yet
got
hold
of
running
about
at
the
back
of
her
brain
that
poverty
is
somehow
she
dislikes
all
organization
and
probably
confuses
wealth
with
the
technique
of
wealth
sovereigns
in
a
stocking
would
bother
her
cheques
do
helen
is
too
relentless
one
ca
deal
in
her
manner
with
the
world
there
this
other
point
and
then
i
must
go
back
to
my
hotel
and
write
some
letters
what
to
be
done
now
about
the
house
in
ducie
street
keep
it
on
at
least
it
depends
when
do
you
want
to
marry
me
she
raised
her
voice
as
too
often
and
some
youths
who
were
also
taking
the
evening
air
overheard
her
getting
a
bit
hot
eh
said
one
wilcox
turned
on
them
and
said
sharply
i
say
there
was
silence
take
care
i
report
you
to
the
police
they
moved
away
quietly
enough
but
were
only
biding
their
time
and
the
rest
of
the
conversation
was
punctuated
by
peals
of
ungovernable
laughter
lowering
his
voice
and
infusing
a
hint
of
reproof
into
it
he
said
evie
will
probably
be
married
in
september
we
could
scarcely
think
of
anything
before
then
the
earlier
the
nicer
henry
females
are
not
supposed
to
say
such
things
but
the
earlier
the
nicer
how
about
september
for
us
too
he
asked
rather
dryly
right
shall
we
go
into
ducie
street
ourselves
in
september
or
shall
we
try
to
bounce
helen
and
tibby
into
it
that
rather
an
idea
they
are
so
unbusinesslike
we
could
make
them
do
anything
by
judicious
management
look
here
yes
we
do
that
and
we
ourselves
could
live
at
howards
end
or
shropshire
he
blew
out
his
cheeks
heavens
how
you
women
do
fly
round
my
head
in
a
whirl
point
by
point
margaret
howards
end
impossible
i
let
it
to
hamar
bryce
on
a
three
years
agreement
last
march
do
you
remember
oniton
well
that
is
much
much
too
far
away
to
rely
on
entirely
you
will
be
able
to
be
down
there
entertaining
a
certain
amount
but
we
must
have
a
house
within
easy
reach
of
town
only
ducie
street
has
huge
drawbacks
there
a
mews
behind
margaret
could
not
help
laughing
it
was
the
first
she
had
heard
of
the
mews
behind
ducie
street
when
she
was
a
possible
tenant
it
had
suppressed
itself
not
consciously
but
automatically
the
breezy
wilcox
manner
though
genuine
lacked
the
clearness
of
vision
that
is
imperative
for
truth
when
henry
lived
in
ducie
street
he
remembered
the
mews
when
he
tried
to
let
he
forgot
it
and
if
anyone
had
remarked
that
the
mews
must
be
either
there
or
not
he
would
have
felt
annoyed
and
afterwards
have
found
some
opportunity
of
stigmatizing
the
speaker
as
academic
so
does
my
grocer
stigmatize
me
when
i
complain
of
the
quality
of
his
sultanas
and
he
answers
in
one
breath
that
they
are
the
best
sultanas
and
how
can
i
expect
the
best
sultanas
at
that
price
it
is
a
flaw
inherent
in
the
business
mind
and
margaret
may
do
well
to
be
tender
to
it
considering
all
that
the
business
mind
has
done
for
england
yes
in
summer
especially
the
mews
is
a
serious
nuisance
the
smoking
room
too
is
an
abominable
little
den
the
house
opposite
has
been
taken
by
operatic
people
ducie
street
going
down
it
my
private
opinion
how
sad
it
only
a
few
years
since
they
built
those
pretty
houses
shows
things
are
moving
good
for
trade
i
hate
this
continual
flux
of
london
it
is
an
epitome
of
us
at
our
worst
eternal
formlessness
all
the
qualities
good
bad
and
indifferent
streaming
away
streaming
streaming
for
ever
that
why
i
dread
it
so
i
mistrust
rivers
even
in
scenery
now
the
sea
high
tide
yes
hoy
toid
from
the
promenading
youths
and
these
are
the
men
to
whom
we
give
the
vote
observed
wilcox
omitting
to
add
that
they
were
also
the
men
to
whom
he
gave
work
as
clerks
work
that
scarcely
encouraged
them
to
grow
into
other
men
however
they
have
their
own
lives
and
interests
let
get
on
he
turned
as
he
spoke
and
prepared
to
see
her
back
to
the
bays
the
business
was
over
his
hotel
was
in
the
opposite
direction
and
if
he
accompanied
her
his
letters
would
be
late
for
the
post
she
implored
him
not
to
come
but
he
was
obdurate
a
nice
beginning
if
your
aunt
saw
you
slip
in
alone
but
i
always
do
go
about
alone
considering
walked
over
the
apennines
it
common
sense
you
will
make
me
so
angry
i
do
the
least
take
it
as
a
compliment
he
laughed
and
lit
a
cigar
it
is
meant
as
a
compliment
my
dear
i
just
wo
have
you
going
about
in
the
dark
such
people
about
too
it
ca
i
look
after
myself
i
do
wish
come
along
margaret
no
wheedling
a
younger
woman
might
have
resented
his
masterly
ways
but
margaret
had
too
firm
a
grip
of
life
to
make
a
fuss
she
was
in
her
own
way
as
masterly
if
he
was
a
fortress
she
was
a
mountain
peak
whom
all
might
tread
but
whom
the
snows
made
nightly
virginal
disdaining
the
heroic
outfit
excitable
in
her
methods
garrulous
episodical
shrill
she
misled
her
lover
much
as
she
had
misled
her
aunt
he
mistook
her
fertility
for
weakness
he
supposed
her
as
clever
as
they
make
but
no
more
not
realizing
that
she
was
penetrating
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
and
approving
of
what
she
found
there
and
if
insight
were
sufficient
if
the
inner
life
were
the
whole
of
life
their
happiness
has
been
assured
they
walked
ahead
briskly
the
parade
and
the
road
after
it
were
well
lighted
but
it
was
darker
in
aunt
juley
garden
as
they
were
going
up
by
the
through
some
rhododendrons
wilcox
who
was
in
front
said
margaret
rather
huskily
turned
dropped
his
cigar
and
took
her
in
his
arms
she
was
startled
and
nearly
screamed
but
recovered
herself
at
once
and
kissed
with
genuine
love
the
lips
that
were
pressed
against
her
own
it
was
their
first
kiss
and
when
it
was
over
he
saw
her
safely
to
the
door
and
rang
the
bell
for
her
but
disappeared
into
the
night
before
the
maid
answered
it
on
looking
back
the
incident
displeased
her
it
was
so
isolated
nothing
in
their
previous
conversation
had
heralded
it
and
worse
still
no
tenderness
had
ensued
if
a
man
can
not
lead
up
to
passion
he
can
at
all
events
lead
down
from
it
and
she
had
hoped
after
her
complaisance
for
some
interchange
of
gentle
words
but
he
had
hurried
away
as
if
ashamed
and
for
an
instant
she
was
reminded
of
helen
and
paul
chapter
charles
had
just
been
scolding
his
dolly
she
deserved
the
scolding
and
had
bent
before
it
but
her
head
though
bloody
was
unsubdued
and
her
chirrupings
began
to
mingle
with
his
retreating
thunder
you
woken
the
baby
i
knew
you
would
tompkin
i
not
responsible
for
what
uncle
percy
does
nor
for
anybody
else
or
anything
so
there
who
asked
him
while
i
was
away
who
asked
my
sister
down
to
meet
him
who
sent
them
out
in
the
motor
day
after
day
charles
that
reminds
me
of
some
poem
does
it
indeed
we
shall
all
be
dancing
to
a
very
different
music
presently
miss
schlegel
has
fairly
got
us
on
toast
i
could
simply
scratch
that
woman
eyes
out
and
to
say
it
my
fault
is
most
unfair
it
your
fault
and
five
months
ago
you
admitted
it
i
did
you
did
tootle
tootle
playing
on
the
pootle
exclaimed
dolly
suddenly
devoting
herself
to
the
child
it
all
very
well
to
turn
the
conversation
but
father
would
never
have
dreamt
of
marrying
as
long
as
evie
was
there
to
make
him
comfortable
but
you
must
needs
start
besides
cahill
too
old
of
course
if
you
going
to
be
rude
to
uncle
percy
miss
schlegel
always
meant
to
get
hold
of
howards
end
and
thanks
to
you
she
got
it
i
call
the
way
you
twist
things
round
and
make
them
hang
together
most
unfair
you
could
have
been
nastier
if
you
caught
me
flirting
could
he
diddums
we
in
a
bad
hole
and
must
make
the
best
of
it
i
shall
answer
the
pater
letter
civilly
he
evidently
anxious
to
do
the
decent
thing
but
i
do
not
intend
to
forget
these
schlegels
in
a
hurry
as
long
as
they
on
their
best
behaviour
dolly
are
you
listening
behave
too
but
if
i
find
them
giving
themselves
airs
or
monopolizing
my
father
or
at
all
him
or
worrying
him
with
their
artistic
beastliness
i
intend
to
put
my
foot
down
yes
firmly
taking
my
mother
place
heaven
knows
what
poor
old
paul
will
say
when
the
news
reaches
him
the
interlude
closes
it
has
taken
place
in
garden
at
hilton
he
and
dolly
are
sitting
in
and
their
motor
is
regarding
them
placidly
from
its
garage
across
the
lawn
a
edition
of
charles
also
regards
them
placidly
a
perambulator
edition
is
squeaking
a
third
edition
is
expected
shortly
nature
is
turning
out
wilcoxes
in
this
peaceful
abode
so
that
they
may
inherit
the
earth
chapter
margaret
greeted
her
lord
with
peculiar
tenderness
on
the
morrow
mature
as
he
was
she
might
yet
be
able
to
help
him
to
the
building
of
the
rainbow
bridge
that
should
connect
the
prose
in
us
with
the
passion
without
it
we
are
meaningless
fragments
half
monks
half
beasts
unconnected
arches
that
have
never
joined
into
a
man
with
it
love
is
born
and
alights
on
the
highest
curve
glowing
against
the
grey
sober
against
the
fire
happy
the
man
who
sees
from
either
aspect
the
glory
of
these
outspread
wings
the
roads
of
his
soul
lie
clear
and
he
and
his
friends
shall
find
it
was
in
the
roads
of
wilcox
soul
from
boyhood
he
had
neglected
them
i
am
not
a
fellow
who
bothers
about
my
own
inside
outwardly
he
was
cheerful
reliable
and
brave
but
within
all
had
reverted
to
chaos
ruled
so
far
as
it
was
ruled
at
all
by
an
incomplete
asceticism
whether
as
boy
husband
or
widower
he
had
always
the
sneaking
belief
that
bodily
passion
is
bad
a
belief
that
is
desirable
only
when
held
passionately
religion
had
confirmed
him
the
words
that
were
read
aloud
on
sunday
to
him
and
to
other
respectable
men
were
the
words
that
had
once
kindled
the
souls
of
catharine
and
francis
into
a
hatred
of
the
carnal
he
be
as
the
saints
and
love
the
infinite
with
a
seraphic
ardour
but
he
could
be
a
little
ashamed
of
loving
a
wife
amabat
amare
timebat
and
it
was
here
that
margaret
hoped
to
help
him
it
did
not
seem
so
difficult
she
need
trouble
him
with
no
gift
of
her
own
she
would
only
point
out
the
salvation
that
was
latent
in
his
own
soul
and
in
the
soul
of
every
man
only
connect
that
was
the
whole
of
her
sermon
only
connect
the
prose
and
the
passion
and
both
will
be
exalted
and
human
love
will
be
seen
at
its
height
live
in
fragments
no
longer
only
connect
and
the
beast
and
the
monk
robbed
of
the
isolation
that
is
life
to
either
will
die
nor
was
the
message
difficult
to
give
it
need
not
take
the
form
of
a
good
talking
by
quiet
indications
the
bridge
would
be
built
and
span
their
lives
with
beauty
but
she
failed
for
there
was
one
quality
in
henry
for
which
she
was
never
prepared
however
much
she
reminded
herself
of
it
his
obtuseness
he
simply
did
not
notice
things
and
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
he
never
noticed
that
helen
and
frieda
were
hostile
or
that
tibby
was
not
interested
in
currant
plantations
he
never
noticed
the
lights
and
shades
that
exist
in
the
grayest
conversation
the
the
milestones
the
collisions
the
illimitable
views
once
on
another
occasion
she
scolded
him
about
it
he
was
puzzled
but
replied
with
a
laugh
my
motto
is
concentrate
i
no
intention
of
frittering
away
my
strength
on
that
sort
of
thing
it
is
frittering
away
the
strength
she
protested
it
enlarging
the
space
in
which
you
may
be
strong
he
answered
you
a
clever
little
woman
but
my
motto
concentrate
and
this
morning
he
concentrated
with
a
vengeance
they
met
in
the
rhododendrons
of
yesterday
in
the
daylight
the
bushes
were
inconsiderable
and
the
path
was
bright
in
the
morning
sun
she
was
with
helen
who
had
been
ominously
quiet
since
the
affair
was
settled
here
we
all
are
she
cried
and
took
him
by
one
hand
retaining
her
sister
in
the
other
here
we
are
helen
helen
replied
mr
wilcox
henry
she
has
had
such
a
nice
letter
from
the
queer
cross
boy
do
you
remember
him
he
had
a
sad
moustache
but
the
back
of
his
head
was
young
i
have
had
a
letter
too
not
a
nice
one
i
want
to
talk
it
over
with
you
for
leonard
bast
was
nothing
to
him
now
that
she
had
given
him
her
word
the
triangle
of
sex
was
broken
for
ever
thanks
to
your
hint
he
clearing
out
of
the
porphyrion
not
a
bad
business
that
porphyrion
he
said
absently
as
he
took
his
own
letter
out
of
his
pocket
not
a
bad
she
exclaimed
dropping
his
hand
surely
on
chelsea
embankment
here
our
hostess
munt
fine
rhododendrons
good
morning
frau
liesecke
we
manage
to
grow
flowers
in
england
do
we
not
a
bad
business
no
my
letter
about
howards
end
bryce
has
been
ordered
abroad
and
wants
to
sublet
it
i
am
far
from
sure
that
i
shall
give
him
permission
there
was
no
clause
in
the
agreement
in
my
opinion
subletting
is
a
mistake
if
he
can
find
me
another
tenant
whom
i
consider
suitable
i
may
cancel
the
agreement
morning
schlegel
do
you
think
that
better
than
subletting
helen
had
dropped
her
hand
now
and
he
had
steered
her
past
the
whole
party
to
the
seaward
side
of
the
house
beneath
them
was
the
bourgeois
little
bay
which
must
have
yearned
all
through
the
centuries
for
just
such
a
as
swanage
to
be
built
on
its
margin
the
waves
were
colourless
and
the
bournemouth
steamer
gave
a
further
touch
of
insipidity
drawn
up
against
the
pier
and
hooting
wildly
for
excursionists
when
there
is
a
sublet
i
find
that
damage
do
excuse
me
but
about
the
porphyrion
i
do
feel
easy
might
i
just
bother
you
henry
her
manner
was
so
serious
that
he
stopped
and
asked
her
a
little
sharply
what
she
wanted
you
said
on
chelsea
embankment
surely
that
it
was
a
bad
concern
so
we
advised
this
clerk
to
clear
out
he
writes
this
morning
that
he
taken
our
advice
and
now
you
say
it
not
a
bad
a
clerk
who
clears
out
of
any
concern
good
or
bad
without
securing
a
berth
somewhere
else
first
is
a
fool
and
i
no
pity
for
him
he
has
not
done
that
he
going
into
a
bank
in
camden
town
he
says
the
salary
much
lower
but
he
hopes
to
manage
a
branch
of
dempster
bank
is
that
all
right
dempster
my
goodness
me
yes
more
right
than
the
porphyrion
yes
yes
yes
safe
as
houses
safer
very
many
thanks
i
sorry
if
you
sublet
if
he
sublets
i
sha
have
the
same
control
in
theory
there
should
be
no
more
damage
done
at
howards
end
in
practice
there
will
be
things
may
be
done
for
which
no
money
can
compensate
for
instance
i
should
want
that
fine
spoilt
it
hangs
margaret
we
must
go
and
see
the
old
place
some
time
it
pretty
in
its
way
motor
down
and
have
lunch
with
charles
i
should
enjoy
that
said
margaret
bravely
what
about
next
wednesday
wednesday
no
i
could
well
do
that
aunt
juley
expects
us
to
stop
here
another
week
at
least
but
you
can
give
that
up
now
er
no
said
margaret
after
a
moment
thought
oh
that
be
all
right
i
speak
to
her
this
visit
is
a
high
solemnity
my
aunt
counts
on
it
year
after
year
she
turns
the
house
upside
down
for
us
she
invites
our
special
friends
she
scarcely
knows
frieda
and
we
ca
leave
her
on
her
hands
i
missed
one
day
and
she
would
be
so
hurt
if
i
did
stay
the
full
ten
but
i
say
a
word
to
her
do
you
bother
henry
i
wo
go
do
bully
me
you
want
to
see
the
house
though
very
much
i
heard
so
much
about
it
one
way
or
the
other
are
there
pigs
teeth
in
the
pigs
teeth
and
you
chew
the
bark
for
toothache
what
a
rum
notion
of
course
not
perhaps
i
have
confused
it
with
some
other
tree
there
are
still
a
great
number
of
sacred
trees
in
england
it
seems
but
he
left
her
to
intercept
munt
whose
voice
could
be
heard
in
the
distance
to
be
intercepted
himself
by
helen
oh
wilcox
about
the
porphyrion
she
began
and
went
scarlet
all
over
her
face
it
all
right
called
margaret
catching
them
up
dempster
bank
better
but
i
think
you
told
us
the
porphyrion
was
bad
and
would
smash
before
christmas
did
i
it
was
still
outside
the
tariff
ring
and
had
to
take
rotten
policies
lately
it
came
in
safe
as
houses
now
in
other
words
bast
need
never
have
left
it
no
the
fellow
need
and
need
have
started
life
elsewhere
at
a
greatly
reduced
salary
he
only
says
corrected
margaret
seeing
trouble
ahead
with
a
man
so
poor
every
reduction
must
be
great
i
consider
it
a
deplorable
misfortune
wilcox
intent
on
his
business
with
munt
was
going
steadily
on
but
the
last
remark
made
him
say
what
what
that
do
you
mean
that
i
responsible
you
ridiculous
helen
you
seem
to
think
he
looked
at
his
watch
let
me
explain
the
point
to
you
it
is
like
this
you
seem
to
assume
when
a
business
concern
is
conducting
a
delicate
negotiation
it
ought
to
keep
the
public
informed
stage
by
stage
the
porphyrion
according
to
you
was
bound
to
say
am
trying
all
i
can
to
get
into
the
tariff
ring
i
am
not
sure
that
i
shall
succeed
but
it
is
the
only
thing
that
will
save
me
from
insolvency
and
i
am
trying
my
dear
helen
is
that
your
point
a
man
who
had
little
money
has
less
that
mine
i
am
grieved
for
your
clerk
but
it
is
all
in
the
day
work
it
part
of
the
battle
of
life
a
man
who
had
little
money
she
repeated
has
less
owing
to
us
under
these
circumstances
i
do
not
consider
battle
of
life
a
happy
expression
oh
come
come
he
protested
pleasantly
you
not
to
blame
no
one
to
blame
is
no
one
to
blame
for
anything
i
would
say
that
but
you
taking
it
far
too
seriously
who
is
this
fellow
we
have
told
you
about
the
fellow
twice
already
said
helen
you
have
even
met
the
fellow
he
is
very
poor
and
his
wife
is
an
extravagant
imbecile
he
is
capable
of
better
things
we
we
the
upper
classes
thought
we
would
help
him
from
the
height
of
our
superior
knowledge
and
here
the
result
he
raised
his
finger
now
a
word
of
advice
i
require
no
more
advice
a
word
of
advice
do
take
up
that
sentimental
attitude
over
the
poor
see
that
she
does
margaret
the
poor
are
poor
and
one
sorry
for
them
but
there
it
is
as
civilization
moves
forward
the
shoe
is
bound
to
pinch
in
places
and
it
absurd
to
pretend
that
anyone
is
responsible
personally
neither
you
nor
i
nor
my
informant
nor
the
man
who
informed
him
nor
the
directors
of
the
porphyrion
are
to
blame
for
this
clerk
loss
of
salary
it
just
the
shoe
pinching
no
one
can
help
it
and
it
might
easily
have
been
worse
helen
quivered
with
indignation
by
all
means
subscribe
to
charities
subscribe
to
them
largely
but
do
get
carried
away
by
absurd
schemes
of
social
reform
i
see
a
good
deal
behind
the
scenes
and
you
can
take
it
from
me
that
there
is
no
social
question
except
for
a
few
journalists
who
try
to
get
a
living
out
of
the
phrase
there
are
just
rich
and
poor
as
there
always
have
been
and
always
will
be
point
me
out
a
time
when
men
have
been
equal
i
did
say
point
me
out
a
time
when
desire
for
equality
has
made
them
happier
no
no
you
ca
there
always
have
been
rich
and
poor
i
no
fatalist
heaven
forbid
but
our
civilization
is
moulded
by
great
impersonal
forces
his
voice
grew
complacent
it
always
did
when
he
eliminated
the
personal
and
there
always
will
be
rich
and
poor
you
ca
deny
it
and
now
it
was
a
respectful
voice
and
you
ca
deny
that
in
spite
of
all
the
tendency
of
civilization
has
on
the
whole
been
upward
owing
to
god
i
suppose
flashed
helen
he
stared
at
her
you
grab
the
dollars
god
does
the
rest
it
was
no
good
instructing
the
girl
if
she
was
going
to
talk
about
god
in
that
neurotic
modern
way
fraternal
to
the
last
he
left
her
for
the
quieter
company
of
munt
he
thought
she
rather
reminds
me
of
dolly
helen
looked
out
at
the
sea
do
even
discuss
political
economy
with
henry
advised
her
sister
it
only
end
in
a
cry
but
he
must
be
one
of
those
men
who
have
reconciled
science
with
religion
said
helen
slowly
i
do
like
those
men
they
are
scientific
themselves
and
talk
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
and
cut
down
the
salaries
of
their
clerks
and
stunt
the
independence
of
all
who
may
menace
their
comfort
but
yet
they
believe
that
somehow
good
and
it
is
always
that
sloppy
will
be
the
outcome
and
that
in
some
mystical
way
the
basts
of
the
future
will
benefit
because
the
basts
of
today
are
in
pain
he
is
such
a
man
in
theory
but
oh
helen
in
theory
but
oh
meg
what
a
theory
why
should
you
put
things
so
bitterly
dearie
because
i
an
old
maid
said
helen
biting
her
lip
i
ca
think
why
i
go
on
like
this
myself
she
shook
off
her
sister
hand
and
went
into
the
house
margaret
distressed
at
the
day
beginning
followed
the
bournemouth
steamer
with
her
eyes
she
saw
that
helen
nerves
were
exasperated
by
the
unlucky
bast
business
beyond
the
bounds
of
politeness
there
might
at
any
minute
be
a
real
explosion
which
even
henry
would
notice
henry
must
be
removed
margaret
her
aunt
called
magsy
it
is
true
surely
what
wilcox
says
that
you
want
to
go
away
early
next
week
not
was
margaret
prompt
reply
but
there
is
so
much
to
be
settled
and
i
do
want
to
see
the
charles
but
going
away
without
taking
the
weymouth
trip
or
even
the
lulworth
said
munt
coming
nearer
without
going
once
more
up
nine
barrows
down
i
afraid
so
wilcox
rejoined
her
with
good
i
did
the
breaking
of
the
ice
a
wave
of
tenderness
came
over
her
she
put
a
hand
on
either
shoulder
and
looked
deeply
into
the
black
bright
eyes
what
was
behind
their
competent
stare
she
knew
but
was
not
disquieted
chapter
margaret
had
no
intention
of
letting
things
slide
and
the
evening
before
she
left
swanage
she
gave
her
sister
a
thorough
scolding
she
censured
her
not
for
disapproving
of
the
engagement
but
for
throwing
over
her
disapproval
a
veil
of
mystery
helen
was
equally
frank
yes
she
said
with
the
air
of
one
looking
inwards
there
is
a
mystery
i
ca
help
it
it
not
my
fault
it
the
way
life
has
been
made
helen
in
those
days
was
in
the
subconscious
self
she
exaggerated
the
punch
and
judy
aspect
of
life
and
spoke
of
mankind
as
puppets
whom
an
invisible
showman
twitches
into
love
and
war
margaret
pointed
out
that
if
she
dwelt
on
this
she
too
would
eliminate
the
personal
helen
was
silent
for
a
minute
and
then
burst
into
a
queer
speech
which
cleared
the
air
go
on
and
marry
him
i
think
you
splendid
and
if
anyone
can
pull
it
off
you
will
margaret
denied
that
there
was
anything
to
pull
off
but
she
continued
yes
there
is
and
i
was
up
to
it
with
paul
i
can
only
do
easy
i
can
only
entice
and
be
enticed
i
ca
and
attempt
difficult
relations
if
i
marry
it
will
either
be
a
man
who
strong
enough
to
boss
me
or
whom
i
strong
enough
to
boss
so
i
sha
ever
marry
for
there
such
men
and
heaven
help
any
one
whom
i
do
marry
for
i
shall
certainly
run
away
from
him
before
you
can
say
robinson
there
because
i
uneducated
but
you
different
you
a
heroine
oh
helen
am
i
will
it
be
as
dreadful
for
poor
henry
as
all
that
you
mean
to
keep
proportion
and
that
heroic
greek
and
i
do
see
why
it
should
succeed
with
you
go
on
and
fight
with
him
and
help
him
do
ask
me
for
help
or
even
for
sympathy
henceforward
i
going
my
own
way
i
mean
to
be
thorough
because
thoroughness
is
easy
i
mean
to
dislike
your
husband
and
to
tell
him
so
i
mean
to
make
no
concessions
to
tibby
if
tibby
wants
to
live
with
me
he
must
lump
me
i
mean
to
love
you
more
than
ever
yes
i
do
you
and
i
have
built
up
something
real
because
it
is
purely
spiritual
there
no
veil
of
mystery
over
us
unreality
and
mystery
begin
as
soon
as
one
touches
the
body
the
popular
view
is
as
usual
exactly
the
wrong
one
our
bothers
are
over
tangible
things
money
husbands
but
heaven
will
work
of
itself
margaret
was
grateful
for
this
expression
of
affection
and
answered
perhaps
all
vistas
close
in
the
unseen
no
one
doubts
it
but
helen
closed
them
rather
too
quickly
for
her
taste
at
every
turn
of
speech
one
was
confronted
with
reality
and
the
absolute
perhaps
margaret
grew
too
old
for
metaphysics
perhaps
henry
was
weaning
her
from
them
but
she
felt
that
there
was
something
a
little
unbalanced
in
the
mind
that
so
readily
shreds
the
visible
the
business
man
who
assumes
that
this
life
is
everything
and
the
mystic
who
asserts
that
it
is
nothing
fail
on
this
side
and
on
that
to
hit
the
truth
yes
i
see
dear
it
about
halfway
between
aunt
juley
had
hazarded
in
earlier
years
no
truth
being
alive
was
not
halfway
between
anything
it
was
only
to
be
found
by
continuous
excursions
into
either
realm
and
though
proportion
is
the
final
secret
to
espouse
it
at
the
outset
is
to
insure
sterility
helen
agreeing
here
disagreeing
there
would
have
talked
till
midnight
but
margaret
with
her
packing
to
do
focussed
the
conversation
on
henry
she
might
abuse
henry
behind
his
back
but
please
would
she
always
be
civil
to
him
in
company
i
definitely
dislike
him
but
i
do
what
i
can
promised
helen
do
what
you
can
with
my
friends
in
return
this
conversation
made
margaret
easier
their
inner
life
was
so
safe
that
they
could
bargain
over
externals
in
a
way
that
would
have
been
incredible
to
aunt
juley
and
impossible
for
tibby
or
charles
there
are
moments
when
the
inner
life
actually
pays
when
years
of
conducted
for
no
ulterior
motive
are
suddenly
of
practical
use
such
moments
are
still
rare
in
the
west
that
they
come
at
all
promises
a
fairer
future
margaret
though
unable
to
understand
her
sister
was
assured
against
estrangement
and
returned
to
london
with
a
more
peaceful
mind
the
following
morning
at
eleven
she
presented
herself
at
the
offices
of
the
imperial
and
west
african
rubber
company
she
was
glad
to
go
there
for
henry
had
implied
his
business
rather
than
described
it
and
the
formlessness
and
vagueness
that
one
associates
with
africa
had
hitherto
brooded
over
the
main
sources
of
his
wealth
not
that
a
visit
to
the
office
cleared
things
up
there
was
just
the
ordinary
surface
scum
of
ledgers
and
polished
counters
and
brass
bars
that
began
and
stopped
for
no
possible
reason
of
globes
blossoming
in
triplets
of
little
rabbit
hutches
faced
with
glass
or
wire
of
little
rabbits
and
even
when
she
penetrated
to
the
inner
depths
she
found
only
the
ordinary
table
and
turkey
carpet
and
though
the
map
over
the
fireplace
did
depict
a
helping
of
west
africa
it
was
a
very
ordinary
map
another
map
hung
opposite
on
which
the
whole
continent
appeared
looking
like
a
whale
marked
out
for
blubber
and
by
its
side
was
a
door
shut
but
henry
voice
came
through
it
dictating
a
strong
letter
she
might
have
been
at
the
porphyrion
or
dempster
bank
or
her
own
everything
seems
just
alike
in
these
days
but
perhaps
she
was
seeing
the
imperial
side
of
the
company
rather
than
its
west
african
and
imperialism
always
had
been
one
of
her
difficulties
one
minute
called
wilcox
on
receiving
her
name
he
touched
a
bell
the
effect
of
which
was
to
produce
charles
charles
had
written
his
father
an
adequate
letter
more
adequate
than
evie
through
which
a
girlish
indignation
throbbed
and
he
greeted
his
future
stepmother
with
propriety
i
hope
that
my
wife
how
do
you
do
will
give
you
a
decent
lunch
was
his
opening
i
left
instructions
but
we
live
in
a
way
she
expects
you
back
to
tea
too
after
you
have
had
a
look
at
howards
end
i
wonder
what
you
think
of
the
place
i
would
touch
it
with
tongs
myself
do
sit
down
it
a
measly
little
place
i
shall
enjoy
seeing
it
said
margaret
feeling
for
the
first
time
shy
you
see
it
at
its
worst
for
bryce
decamped
abroad
last
monday
without
even
arranging
for
a
charwoman
to
clear
up
after
him
i
never
saw
such
a
disgraceful
mess
unbelievable
he
was
in
the
house
a
month
i
more
than
a
little
bone
to
pick
with
bryce
called
henry
from
the
inner
chamber
why
did
he
go
so
suddenly
invalid
type
could
sleep
poor
fellow
poor
fiddlesticks
said
wilcox
joining
them
he
had
the
impudence
to
put
up
without
as
much
as
saying
with
your
leave
or
by
your
leave
charles
flung
them
down
yes
i
flung
them
down
said
charles
modestly
i
sent
a
telegram
after
him
and
a
pretty
sharp
one
too
he
and
he
in
person
is
responsible
for
the
upkeep
of
that
house
for
the
next
three
years
the
keys
are
at
the
farm
we
would
have
the
keys
quite
right
dolly
would
have
taken
them
but
i
was
in
fortunately
what
bryce
like
asked
margaret
but
nobody
cared
bryce
was
the
tenant
who
had
no
right
to
sublet
to
have
defined
him
further
was
a
waste
of
time
on
his
misdeeds
they
descanted
profusely
until
the
girl
who
had
been
typing
the
strong
letter
came
out
with
it
wilcox
added
his
signature
now
we
be
off
said
he
a
a
form
of
felicity
detested
by
margaret
awaited
her
charles
saw
them
in
civil
to
the
last
and
in
a
moment
the
offices
of
the
imperial
and
west
african
rubber
company
faded
away
but
it
was
not
an
impressive
drive
perhaps
the
weather
was
to
blame
being
grey
and
banked
high
with
weary
clouds
perhaps
hertfordshire
is
scarcely
intended
for
motorists
did
not
a
gentleman
once
motor
so
quickly
through
westmoreland
that
he
missed
it
and
if
westmoreland
can
be
missed
it
will
fare
ill
with
a
county
whose
delicate
structure
particularly
needs
the
attentive
eye
hertfordshire
is
england
at
its
quietest
with
little
emphasis
of
river
and
hill
it
is
england
meditative
if
drayton
were
with
us
again
to
write
a
new
edition
of
his
incomparable
poem
he
would
sing
the
nymphs
of
hertfordshire
as
indeterminate
of
feature
with
hair
obfuscated
by
the
london
smoke
their
eyes
would
be
sad
and
averted
from
their
fate
towards
the
northern
flats
their
leader
not
isis
or
sabrina
but
the
slowly
flowing
lea
no
glory
of
raiment
would
be
theirs
no
urgency
of
dance
but
they
would
be
real
nymphs
the
chauffeur
could
not
travel
as
quickly
as
he
had
hoped
for
the
great
north
road
was
full
of
easter
traffic
but
he
went
quite
quick
enough
for
margaret
a
creature
who
had
chickens
and
children
on
the
brain
they
all
right
said
wilcox
learn
like
the
swallows
and
the
yes
but
while
they
learning
the
motor
come
to
stay
he
answered
one
must
get
about
there
a
pretty
church
oh
you
are
sharp
enough
well
look
out
if
the
road
worries
you
right
outward
at
the
she
looked
at
the
scenery
it
heaved
and
merged
like
porridge
presently
it
congealed
they
had
arrived
charles
house
on
the
left
on
the
right
the
swelling
forms
of
the
six
hills
their
appearance
in
such
a
neighbourhood
surprised
her
they
interrupted
the
stream
of
residences
that
was
thickening
up
towards
hilton
beyond
them
she
saw
meadows
and
a
wood
and
beneath
them
she
settled
that
soldiers
of
the
best
kind
lay
buried
she
hated
war
and
liked
soldiers
it
was
one
of
her
amiable
inconsistencies
but
here
was
dolly
dressed
up
to
the
nines
standing
at
the
door
to
greet
them
and
here
were
the
first
drops
of
the
rain
they
ran
in
gaily
and
after
a
long
wait
in
the
sat
down
to
the
lunch
every
dish
in
which
concealed
or
exuded
cream
bryce
was
the
chief
topic
of
conversation
dolly
described
his
visit
with
the
key
while
her
gave
satisfaction
by
chaffing
her
and
contradicting
all
she
said
it
was
evidently
the
custom
to
laugh
at
dolly
he
chaffed
margaret
too
and
margaret
roused
from
a
grave
meditation
was
pleased
and
chaffed
him
back
dolly
seemed
surprised
and
eyed
her
curiously
after
lunch
the
two
children
came
down
margaret
disliked
babies
but
hit
it
off
better
with
the
and
sent
dolly
into
fits
of
laughter
by
talking
sense
to
him
kiss
them
now
and
come
away
said
wilcox
she
came
but
refused
to
kiss
them
it
was
such
hard
luck
on
the
little
things
she
said
and
though
dolly
proffered
and
in
turn
she
was
obdurate
by
this
time
it
was
raining
steadily
the
car
came
round
with
the
hood
up
and
again
she
lost
all
sense
of
space
in
a
few
minutes
they
stopped
and
crane
opened
the
door
of
the
car
what
happened
asked
margaret
what
do
you
suppose
said
henry
a
little
porch
was
close
up
against
her
face
are
we
there
already
we
are
well
i
never
in
years
ago
it
seemed
so
far
away
smiling
but
somehow
disillusioned
she
jumped
out
and
her
impetus
carried
her
to
the
she
was
about
to
open
it
when
henry
said
that
no
good
it
locked
who
got
the
key
as
he
had
himself
forgotten
to
call
for
the
key
at
the
farm
no
one
replied
he
also
wanted
to
know
who
had
left
the
front
gate
open
since
a
cow
had
strayed
in
from
the
road
and
was
spoiling
the
croquet
lawn
then
he
said
rather
crossly
margaret
you
wait
in
the
dry
i
go
down
for
the
key
it
is
a
hundred
yards
may
i
come
too
no
i
shall
be
back
before
i
gone
then
the
car
turned
away
and
it
was
as
if
a
curtain
had
risen
for
the
second
time
that
day
she
saw
the
appearance
of
the
earth
there
were
the
that
helen
had
once
described
there
the
tennis
lawn
there
the
hedge
that
would
be
glorious
with
in
june
but
the
vision
now
was
of
black
and
palest
green
down
by
the
more
vivid
colours
were
awakening
and
lent
lilies
stood
sentinel
on
its
margin
or
advanced
in
battalions
over
the
grass
tulips
were
a
tray
of
jewels
she
could
not
see
the
tree
but
a
branch
of
the
celebrated
vine
studded
with
velvet
knobs
had
covered
the
porch
she
was
struck
by
the
fertility
of
the
soil
she
had
seldom
been
in
a
garden
where
the
flowers
looked
so
well
and
even
the
weeds
she
was
idly
plucking
out
of
the
porch
were
intensely
green
why
had
poor
bryce
fled
from
all
this
beauty
for
she
had
already
decided
that
the
place
was
beautiful
naughty
cow
go
away
cried
margaret
to
the
cow
but
without
indignation
harder
came
the
rain
pouring
out
of
a
windless
sky
and
spattering
up
from
the
of
the
which
lay
in
a
row
on
the
lawn
where
charles
had
hurled
them
she
must
have
interviewed
charles
in
another
world
where
one
did
have
interviews
how
helen
would
revel
in
such
a
notion
charles
dead
all
people
dead
nothing
alive
but
houses
and
gardens
the
obvious
dead
the
intangible
alive
and
no
connection
at
all
between
them
margaret
smiled
would
that
her
own
fancies
were
as
would
that
she
could
deal
as
with
the
world
smiling
and
sighing
she
laid
her
hand
upon
the
door
it
opened
the
house
was
not
locked
up
at
all
she
hesitated
ought
she
to
wait
for
henry
he
felt
strongly
about
property
and
might
prefer
to
show
her
over
himself
on
the
other
hand
he
had
told
her
to
keep
in
the
dry
and
the
porch
was
beginning
to
drip
so
she
went
in
and
the
drought
from
inside
slammed
the
door
behind
desolation
greeted
her
dirty
were
on
the
flue
and
rubbish
on
its
unwashed
boards
the
civilization
of
luggage
had
been
here
for
a
month
and
then
decamped
and
drawing
room
right
and
left
were
guessed
only
by
their
they
were
just
rooms
where
one
could
shelter
from
the
rain
across
the
ceiling
of
each
ran
a
great
beam
the
and
hall
revealed
theirs
openly
but
the
was
because
the
facts
of
life
must
be
concealed
from
ladies
and
hall
how
petty
the
names
sounded
here
were
simply
three
rooms
where
children
could
play
and
friends
shelter
from
the
rain
yes
and
they
were
beautiful
then
she
opened
one
of
the
doors
opposite
there
were
two
and
exchanged
for
whitewash
it
was
the
servants
part
though
she
scarcely
realized
that
just
rooms
again
where
friends
might
shelter
the
garden
at
the
back
was
full
of
flowering
cherries
and
plums
farther
on
were
hints
of
the
meadow
and
a
black
cliff
of
pines
yes
the
meadow
was
beautiful
penned
in
by
the
desolate
weather
she
recaptured
the
sense
of
space
which
the
motor
had
tried
to
rob
from
her
she
remembered
again
that
ten
square
miles
are
not
ten
times
as
wonderful
as
one
square
mile
that
a
thousand
square
miles
are
not
practically
the
same
as
heaven
the
phantom
of
bigness
which
london
encourages
was
laid
for
ever
when
she
paced
from
the
hall
at
howards
end
to
its
kitchen
and
heard
the
rains
run
this
way
and
that
where
the
watershed
of
the
roof
divided
them
now
helen
came
to
her
mind
scrutinizing
half
wessex
from
the
ridge
of
the
purbeck
downs
and
saying
you
will
have
to
lose
something
she
was
not
so
sure
for
instance
she
would
double
her
kingdom
by
opening
the
door
that
concealed
the
stairs
now
she
thought
of
the
map
of
africa
of
empires
of
her
father
of
the
two
supreme
nations
streams
of
whose
life
warmed
her
blood
but
mingling
had
cooled
her
brain
she
paced
back
into
the
hall
and
as
she
did
so
the
house
reverberated
is
that
you
henry
she
called
there
was
no
answer
but
the
house
reverberated
again
henry
have
you
got
in
but
it
was
the
heart
of
the
house
beating
faintly
at
first
then
loudly
martially
it
dominated
the
rain
it
is
the
starved
imagination
not
the
that
is
afraid
margaret
flung
open
the
door
to
the
stairs
a
noise
as
of
drums
seemed
to
deafen
her
a
woman
an
old
woman
was
descending
with
figure
erect
with
face
impassive
with
lips
that
parted
and
said
dryly
oh
well
i
took
you
for
ruth
wilcox
margaret
stammered
i
mrs
wilcox
i
in
fancy
of
course
in
fancy
you
had
her
way
of
walking
and
the
old
woman
passed
out
into
the
rain
chapter
it
gave
her
quite
a
turn
said
wilcox
when
retailing
the
incident
to
dolly
at
none
of
you
girls
have
any
nerves
really
of
course
a
word
from
me
put
it
all
right
but
silly
old
miss
avery
she
frightened
you
she
margaret
there
you
stood
clutching
a
bunch
of
weeds
she
might
have
said
something
instead
of
coming
down
the
stairs
with
that
alarming
bonnet
on
i
passed
her
as
i
came
in
enough
to
make
the
car
shy
i
believe
miss
avery
goes
in
for
being
a
character
some
old
maids
do
he
lit
a
cigarette
it
is
their
last
resource
heaven
knows
what
she
was
doing
in
the
place
but
that
bryce
business
not
mine
i
was
as
foolish
as
you
suggest
said
margaret
she
only
startled
me
for
the
house
had
been
silent
so
long
did
you
take
her
for
a
spook
asked
dolly
for
whom
spooks
and
going
to
church
summarized
the
unseen
not
exactly
she
really
did
frighten
you
said
henry
who
was
far
from
discouraging
timidity
in
females
poor
margaret
and
very
naturally
uneducated
classes
are
so
stupid
is
miss
avery
uneducated
classes
margaret
asked
and
found
herself
looking
at
the
decoration
scheme
of
she
just
one
of
the
crew
at
the
farm
people
like
that
always
assume
things
she
assumed
you
know
who
she
was
she
left
all
the
howards
end
keys
in
the
front
lobby
and
assumed
that
you
seen
them
as
you
came
in
that
lock
up
the
house
when
you
done
and
would
bring
them
on
down
to
her
and
there
was
her
niece
hunting
for
them
down
at
the
farm
lack
of
education
makes
people
very
casual
hilton
was
full
of
women
like
miss
avery
once
i
should
have
disliked
it
perhaps
or
miss
avery
giving
me
a
wedding
present
said
dolly
which
was
illogical
but
interesting
through
dolly
margaret
was
destined
to
learn
a
good
deal
but
charles
said
i
must
try
not
to
mind
because
she
had
known
his
grandmother
as
usual
you
got
the
story
wrong
my
good
dorothea
i
mean
the
one
who
left
wilcox
the
house
were
both
of
them
and
miss
avery
friends
when
howards
end
too
was
a
farm
her
blew
out
a
shaft
of
smoke
his
attitude
to
his
dead
wife
was
curious
he
would
allude
to
her
and
hear
her
discussed
but
never
mentioned
her
by
name
nor
was
he
interested
in
the
dim
bucolic
past
dolly
was
for
the
following
reason
then
had
wilcox
a
brother
or
was
it
an
uncle
anyhow
he
popped
the
question
and
miss
avery
she
said
just
imagine
if
she
said
she
would
have
been
charles
aunt
oh
i
say
that
rather
good
aunt
i
must
chaff
him
about
that
this
evening
and
the
man
went
out
and
was
killed
yes
i
certain
i
got
it
right
now
tom
howard
he
was
the
last
of
them
i
believe
so
said
wilcox
negligently
i
say
howards
end
howard
ended
cried
dolly
i
rather
on
the
spot
this
evening
eh
i
wish
you
ask
whether
crane
ended
oh
wilcox
how
can
you
because
if
he
has
had
enough
tea
we
ought
to
dolly
a
good
little
woman
he
continued
but
a
little
of
her
goes
a
long
way
i
could
live
near
her
if
you
paid
me
margaret
smiled
though
presenting
a
firm
front
to
outsiders
no
wilcox
could
live
near
or
near
the
possessions
of
any
other
wilcox
they
had
the
colonial
spirit
and
were
always
making
for
some
spot
where
the
white
man
might
carry
his
burden
unobserved
of
course
howards
end
was
impossible
so
long
as
the
younger
couple
were
established
in
hilton
his
objections
to
the
house
were
plain
as
daylight
now
crane
had
had
enough
tea
and
was
sent
to
the
garage
where
their
car
had
been
trickling
muddy
water
over
charles
the
downpour
had
surely
penetrated
the
six
hills
by
now
bringing
news
of
our
restless
civilization
curious
mounds
said
henry
but
in
with
you
now
another
time
he
had
to
be
up
in
london
by
seven
if
possible
by
once
more
she
lost
the
sense
of
space
once
more
trees
houses
people
animals
hills
merged
and
heaved
into
one
dirtiness
and
she
was
at
wickham
place
her
evening
was
pleasant
the
sense
of
flux
which
had
haunted
her
all
the
year
disappeared
for
a
time
she
forgot
the
luggage
and
the
and
the
hurrying
men
who
know
so
much
and
connect
so
little
she
recaptured
the
sense
of
space
which
is
the
basis
of
all
earthly
beauty
and
starting
from
howards
end
she
attempted
to
realize
england
she
failed
visions
do
not
come
when
we
try
though
they
may
come
through
trying
but
an
unexpected
love
of
the
island
awoke
in
her
connecting
on
this
side
with
the
joys
of
the
flesh
on
that
with
the
inconceivable
helen
and
her
father
had
known
this
love
poor
leonard
bast
was
groping
after
it
but
it
had
been
hidden
from
margaret
till
this
afternoon
it
had
certainly
come
through
the
house
and
old
miss
avery
through
them
the
notion
of
through
persisted
her
mind
trembled
towards
a
conclusion
which
only
the
unwise
have
put
into
words
then
veering
back
into
warmth
it
dwelt
on
ruddy
bricks
flowering
and
all
the
tangible
joys
of
spring
henry
after
allaying
her
agitation
had
taken
her
over
his
property
and
had
explained
to
her
the
use
and
dimensions
of
the
various
rooms
he
had
sketched
the
history
of
the
little
estate
it
is
so
unlucky
ran
the
monologue
that
money
was
put
into
it
about
fifty
years
ago
then
it
had
four
the
land
thirty
acres
at
least
one
could
have
made
something
out
of
it
then
a
small
park
or
at
all
events
shrubberies
and
rebuilt
the
house
farther
away
from
the
road
what
the
good
of
taking
it
in
hand
now
nothing
but
the
meadow
left
and
even
that
was
heavily
mortgaged
when
i
first
had
to
do
with
things
yes
and
the
house
too
oh
it
was
no
joke
she
saw
two
women
as
he
spoke
one
old
the
other
young
watching
their
inheritance
melt
away
she
saw
them
greet
him
as
a
deliverer
mismanagement
did
it
besides
the
days
for
small
farms
are
over
it
does
pay
except
with
intensive
cultivation
small
holdings
back
to
the
land
ah
philanthropic
bunkum
take
it
as
a
rule
that
nothing
pays
on
a
small
scale
most
of
the
land
you
see
they
were
standing
at
an
upper
window
the
only
one
which
faced
west
belongs
to
the
people
at
the
park
they
made
their
pile
over
copper
good
chaps
avery
farm
sishe
what
they
call
the
common
where
you
see
that
ruined
oak
one
after
the
other
fell
in
and
so
did
this
as
near
as
is
no
matter
but
henry
had
saved
it
without
fine
feelings
or
deep
insight
but
he
had
saved
it
and
she
loved
him
for
the
deed
when
i
had
more
control
i
did
what
i
could
sold
off
the
two
and
a
half
animals
and
the
mangy
pony
and
the
superannuated
tools
pulled
down
the
outhouses
drained
thinned
out
i
do
know
how
many
and
and
inside
the
house
i
turned
the
old
kitchen
into
a
hall
and
made
a
kitchen
behind
where
the
dairy
was
garage
and
so
on
came
later
but
one
could
still
tell
it
been
an
old
farm
and
yet
it
is
the
place
that
would
fetch
one
of
your
artistic
crew
no
it
was
and
if
he
did
not
quite
understand
it
the
artistic
crew
would
still
less
it
was
english
and
the
that
she
saw
from
the
window
was
an
english
tree
no
report
had
prepared
her
for
its
peculiar
glory
it
was
neither
warrior
nor
lover
nor
god
in
none
of
these
roles
do
the
english
excel
it
was
a
comrade
bending
over
the
house
strength
and
adventure
in
its
roots
but
in
its
utmost
fingers
tenderness
and
the
girth
that
a
dozen
men
could
not
have
spanned
became
in
the
end
evanescent
till
pale
bud
clusters
seemed
to
float
in
the
air
it
was
a
comrade
house
and
tree
transcended
any
similes
of
sex
margaret
thought
of
them
now
and
was
to
think
of
them
through
many
a
windy
night
and
london
day
but
to
compare
either
to
man
to
woman
always
dwarfed
the
vision
yet
they
kept
within
limits
of
the
human
their
message
was
not
of
eternity
but
of
hope
on
this
side
of
the
grave
as
she
stood
in
the
one
gazing
at
the
other
truer
relationship
had
gleamed
another
touch
and
the
account
of
her
day
is
finished
they
entered
the
garden
for
a
minute
and
to
surprise
she
was
right
teeth
pigs
teeth
could
be
seen
in
the
bark
of
the
tree
just
the
white
tips
of
them
showing
extraordinary
he
cried
who
told
you
i
heard
of
it
one
winter
in
london
was
her
answer
for
she
too
avoided
mentioning
wilcox
by
name
chapter
evie
heard
of
her
father
engagement
when
she
was
in
for
a
tennis
tournament
and
her
play
went
simply
to
pot
that
she
should
marry
and
leave
him
had
seemed
natural
enough
that
he
left
alone
should
do
the
same
was
deceitful
and
now
charles
and
dolly
said
that
it
was
all
her
fault
but
i
never
dreamt
of
such
a
thing
she
grumbled
dad
took
me
to
call
now
and
then
and
made
me
ask
her
to
simpson
well
i
altogether
off
dad
it
was
also
an
insult
to
their
mother
memory
there
they
were
agreed
and
evie
had
the
idea
of
returning
wilcox
lace
and
jewellery
as
a
protest
against
what
it
would
protest
she
was
not
clear
but
being
only
eighteen
the
idea
of
renunciation
appealed
to
her
the
more
as
she
did
not
care
for
jewellery
or
lace
dolly
then
suggested
that
she
and
uncle
percy
should
pretend
to
break
off
their
engagement
and
then
perhaps
wilcox
would
quarrel
with
miss
schlegel
and
break
off
his
or
paul
might
be
cabled
for
but
at
this
point
charles
told
them
not
to
talk
nonsense
so
evie
settled
to
marry
as
soon
as
possible
it
was
no
good
hanging
about
with
these
schlegels
eyeing
her
the
date
of
her
wedding
was
consequently
put
forward
from
september
to
august
and
in
the
intoxication
of
presents
she
recovered
much
of
her
margaret
found
that
she
was
expected
to
figure
at
this
function
and
to
figure
largely
it
would
be
such
an
opportunity
said
henry
for
her
to
get
to
know
his
set
sir
james
bidder
would
be
there
and
all
the
cahills
and
the
fussells
and
his
warrington
wilcox
had
fortunately
got
back
from
her
tour
round
the
world
henry
she
loved
but
his
set
promised
to
be
another
matter
he
had
not
the
knack
of
surrounding
himself
with
nice
people
indeed
for
a
man
of
ability
and
virtue
his
choice
had
been
singularly
unfortunate
he
had
no
guiding
principle
beyond
a
certain
preference
for
mediocrity
he
was
content
to
settle
one
of
the
greatest
things
in
life
haphazard
and
so
while
his
investments
went
right
his
friends
generally
went
wrong
she
would
be
told
oh
a
good
sort
a
thundering
good
sort
and
find
on
meeting
him
that
he
was
a
brute
or
a
bore
if
henry
had
shown
real
affection
she
would
have
understood
for
affection
explains
everything
but
he
seemed
without
sentiment
the
thundering
good
sort
might
at
any
moment
become
a
fellow
for
whom
i
never
did
have
much
use
and
have
less
now
and
be
shaken
off
cheerily
into
oblivion
margaret
had
done
the
same
as
a
schoolgirl
now
she
never
forgot
anyone
for
whom
she
had
once
cared
she
connected
though
the
connection
might
be
bitter
and
she
hoped
that
some
day
henry
would
do
the
same
evie
was
not
to
be
married
from
ducie
street
she
had
a
fancy
for
something
rural
and
besides
no
one
would
be
in
london
then
so
she
left
her
boxes
for
a
few
weeks
at
oniton
grange
and
her
banns
were
duly
published
in
the
parish
church
and
for
a
couple
of
days
the
little
town
dreaming
between
the
ruddy
hills
was
roused
by
the
clang
of
our
civilization
and
drew
up
by
the
roadside
to
let
the
motors
pass
oniton
had
been
a
discovery
of
wilcox
a
discovery
of
which
he
was
not
altogether
proud
it
was
up
towards
the
welsh
border
and
so
difficult
of
access
that
he
had
concluded
it
must
be
something
special
a
ruined
castle
stood
in
the
grounds
but
having
got
there
what
was
one
to
do
the
shooting
was
bad
the
fishing
indifferent
and
reported
the
scenery
as
nothing
much
the
place
turned
out
to
be
in
the
wrong
part
of
shropshire
damn
it
and
though
he
never
damned
his
own
property
aloud
he
was
only
waiting
to
get
it
off
his
hands
and
then
to
let
fly
evie
marriage
was
its
last
appearance
in
public
as
soon
as
a
tenant
was
found
it
became
a
house
for
which
he
never
had
had
much
use
and
had
less
now
and
like
howards
end
faded
into
limbo
but
on
margaret
oniton
was
destined
to
make
a
lasting
impression
she
regarded
it
as
her
future
home
and
was
anxious
to
start
straight
with
the
clergy
and
if
possible
to
see
something
of
the
local
life
it
was
a
as
tiny
a
one
as
england
possesses
and
had
for
ages
served
that
lonely
valley
and
guarded
our
marches
against
the
kelt
in
spite
of
the
occasion
in
spite
of
the
numbing
hilarity
that
greeted
her
as
soon
as
she
got
into
the
reserved
saloon
at
paddington
her
senses
were
awake
and
watching
and
though
oniton
was
to
prove
one
of
her
innumerable
false
starts
she
never
forgot
it
nor
the
things
that
happened
there
the
london
party
only
numbered
eight
the
fussells
father
and
son
two
ladies
named
plynlimmon
and
lady
edser
warrington
wilcox
and
her
daughter
and
lastly
the
little
girl
very
smart
and
quiet
who
figures
at
so
many
weddings
and
who
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
margaret
the
dolly
was
absent
a
domestic
event
detained
her
at
hilton
paul
had
cabled
a
humorous
message
charles
was
to
meet
them
with
a
trio
of
motors
at
shrewsbury
helen
had
refused
her
invitation
tibby
had
never
answered
his
the
management
was
excellent
as
was
to
be
expected
with
anything
that
henry
undertook
one
was
conscious
of
his
sensible
and
generous
brain
in
the
background
they
were
his
guests
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
train
a
special
label
for
their
luggage
a
courier
a
special
lunch
they
had
only
to
look
pleasant
and
where
possible
pretty
margaret
thought
with
dismay
of
her
own
nuptials
presumably
under
the
management
of
tibby
theobald
schlegel
and
miss
helen
schlegel
request
the
pleasure
of
plynlimmon
company
on
the
occasion
of
the
marriage
of
their
sister
margaret
the
formula
was
incredible
but
it
must
soon
be
printed
and
sent
and
though
wickham
place
need
not
compete
with
oniton
it
must
feed
its
guests
properly
and
provide
them
with
sufficient
chairs
her
wedding
would
either
be
ramshackly
or
bourgeois
she
hoped
the
latter
such
an
affair
as
the
present
staged
with
a
deftness
that
was
almost
beautiful
lay
beyond
her
powers
and
those
of
her
friends
the
low
rich
purr
of
a
great
western
express
is
not
the
worst
background
for
conversation
and
the
journey
passed
pleasantly
enough
nothing
could
have
exceeded
the
kindness
of
the
two
men
they
raised
windows
for
some
ladies
and
lowered
them
for
others
they
rang
the
bell
for
the
servant
they
identified
the
colleges
as
the
train
slipped
past
oxford
they
caught
books
or
in
the
act
of
tumbling
on
to
the
floor
yet
there
was
nothing
finicky
about
their
politeness
it
had
the
public
school
touch
and
though
sedulous
was
virile
more
battles
than
waterloo
have
been
won
on
our
and
margaret
bowed
to
a
charm
of
which
she
did
not
wholly
approve
and
said
nothing
when
the
oxford
colleges
were
identified
wrongly
male
and
female
created
he
them
the
journey
to
shrewsbury
confirmed
this
questionable
statement
and
the
long
glass
saloon
that
moved
so
easily
and
felt
so
comfortable
became
a
for
the
idea
of
sex
at
shrewsbury
came
fresh
air
margaret
was
all
for
and
while
the
others
were
finishing
their
tea
at
the
raven
she
annexed
a
motor
and
hurried
over
the
astonishing
city
her
chauffeur
was
not
the
faithful
crane
but
an
italian
who
dearly
loved
making
her
late
charles
watch
in
hand
though
with
a
level
brow
was
standing
in
front
of
the
hotel
when
they
returned
it
was
perfectly
all
right
he
told
her
she
was
by
no
means
the
last
and
then
he
dived
into
the
and
she
heard
him
say
for
god
sake
hurry
the
women
up
we
shall
never
be
off
and
albert
fussell
reply
not
i
i
done
my
share
and
colonel
fussell
opine
that
the
ladies
were
getting
themselves
up
to
kill
presently
myra
daughter
appeared
and
as
she
was
his
cousin
charles
blew
her
up
a
little
she
had
been
changing
her
smart
traveling
hat
for
a
smart
motor
hat
then
warrington
herself
leading
the
quiet
child
the
two
ladies
were
always
last
maids
courier
heavy
luggage
had
already
gone
on
by
a
to
a
station
nearer
oniton
but
there
were
five
and
four
to
be
packed
and
five
to
be
put
on
and
to
be
put
off
at
the
last
moment
because
charles
declared
them
not
necessary
the
men
presided
over
everything
with
unfailing
by
five
the
party
was
ready
and
went
out
of
shrewsbury
by
the
welsh
bridge
shropshire
had
not
the
reticence
of
hertfordshire
though
robbed
of
half
its
magic
by
swift
movement
it
still
conveyed
the
sense
of
hills
they
were
nearing
the
buttresses
that
force
the
severn
eastern
and
make
it
an
english
stream
and
the
sun
sinking
over
the
sentinels
of
wales
was
straight
in
their
eyes
having
picked
up
another
guest
they
turned
southward
avoiding
the
greater
mountains
but
conscious
of
an
occasional
summit
rounded
and
mild
whose
colouring
differed
in
quality
from
that
of
the
lower
earth
and
whose
contours
altered
more
slowly
quiet
mysteries
were
in
progress
behind
those
tossing
horizons
the
west
as
ever
was
retreating
with
some
secret
which
may
not
be
worth
the
discovery
but
which
no
practical
man
will
ever
discover
they
spoke
of
tariff
reform
warrington
was
just
back
from
the
colonies
like
many
other
critics
of
empire
her
mouth
had
been
stopped
with
food
and
she
could
only
exclaim
at
the
hospitality
with
which
she
had
been
received
and
warn
the
mother
country
against
trifling
with
young
titans
they
threaten
to
cut
the
painter
she
cried
and
where
shall
we
be
then
miss
schlegel
you
undertake
to
keep
henry
sound
about
tariff
reform
it
is
our
last
hope
margaret
playfully
confessed
herself
on
the
other
side
and
they
began
to
quote
from
their
respective
while
the
motor
carried
them
deep
into
the
hills
curious
these
were
rather
than
impressive
for
their
outlines
lacked
beauty
and
the
pink
fields
on
their
summits
suggested
the
handkerchiefs
of
a
giant
spread
out
to
dry
an
occasional
outcrop
of
rock
an
occasional
wood
an
occasional
forest
treeless
and
brown
all
hinted
at
wildness
to
follow
but
the
main
colour
was
an
agricultural
green
the
air
grew
cooler
they
had
surmounted
the
last
gradient
and
oniton
lay
below
them
with
its
church
its
radiating
houses
its
castle
its
peninsula
close
to
the
castle
was
a
grey
mansion
unintellectual
but
kindly
stretching
with
its
grounds
across
the
neck
the
sort
of
mansion
that
was
built
all
over
england
in
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
while
architecture
was
still
an
expression
of
the
national
character
that
was
the
grange
remarked
albert
over
his
shoulder
and
then
he
jammed
the
brake
on
and
the
motor
slowed
down
and
stopped
i
sorry
said
he
turning
round
do
you
mind
getting
out
by
the
door
on
the
right
steady
on
what
happened
asked
warrington
then
the
car
behind
them
drew
up
and
the
voice
of
charles
was
heard
saying
get
out
the
women
at
once
there
was
a
concourse
of
males
and
margaret
and
her
companions
were
hustled
out
and
received
into
the
second
car
what
had
happened
as
it
started
off
again
the
door
of
a
cottage
opened
and
a
girl
screamed
wildly
at
them
what
is
it
the
ladies
cried
charles
drove
them
a
hundred
yards
without
speaking
then
he
said
it
all
right
your
car
just
touched
a
dog
but
stop
cried
margaret
horrified
it
did
hurt
him
did
really
hurt
him
asked
myra
no
do
please
stop
said
margaret
leaning
forward
she
was
standing
up
in
the
car
the
other
occupants
holding
her
knees
to
steady
her
i
want
to
go
back
please
charles
took
no
notice
we
left
fussell
behind
said
another
and
angelo
and
crane
yes
but
no
woman
i
expect
a
little
of
warrington
scratched
her
palm
will
be
more
to
the
point
than
one
of
us
the
insurance
company
sees
to
that
remarked
charles
and
albert
will
do
the
talking
i
want
to
go
back
though
i
say
repeated
margaret
getting
angry
charles
took
no
notice
the
motor
loaded
with
refugees
continued
to
travel
very
slowly
down
the
hill
the
men
are
there
chorused
the
others
men
will
see
to
it
the
men
ca
see
to
it
oh
this
is
ridiculous
charles
i
ask
you
to
stop
stopping
no
good
drawled
charles
is
it
said
margaret
and
jumped
straight
out
of
the
car
she
fell
on
her
knees
cut
her
gloves
shook
her
hat
over
her
ear
cries
of
alarm
followed
her
you
hurt
yourself
exclaimed
charles
jumping
after
her
of
course
i
hurt
myself
she
retorted
may
i
ask
what
there
nothing
to
ask
said
margaret
your
hand
bleeding
i
know
i
in
for
a
frightful
row
from
the
pater
you
should
have
thought
of
that
sooner
charles
charles
had
never
been
in
such
a
position
before
it
was
a
woman
in
revolt
who
was
hobbling
away
from
him
and
the
sight
was
too
strange
to
leave
any
room
for
anger
he
recovered
himself
when
the
others
caught
them
up
their
sort
he
understood
he
commanded
them
to
go
back
albert
fussell
was
seen
walking
towards
them
it
all
right
he
called
it
was
a
dog
it
was
a
cat
there
exclaimed
charles
triumphantly
it
only
a
rotten
cat
got
room
in
your
car
for
a
little
un
i
cut
as
soon
as
i
saw
it
was
a
dog
the
chauffeurs
are
tackling
the
girl
but
margaret
walked
forward
steadily
why
should
the
chauffeurs
tackle
the
girl
ladies
sheltering
behind
men
men
sheltering
behind
servants
the
whole
wrong
and
she
must
challenge
it
miss
schlegel
my
word
you
hurt
your
hand
i
just
going
to
see
said
margaret
do
you
wait
mr
fussell
the
second
motor
came
round
the
corner
lt
is
all
right
madam
said
crane
in
his
turn
he
had
taken
to
calling
her
madam
what
all
right
the
cat
yes
madam
the
girl
will
receive
compensation
for
it
she
was
a
very
ruda
girla
said
angelo
from
the
third
motor
thoughtfully
would
you
have
been
rude
the
italian
spread
out
his
hands
implying
that
he
had
not
thought
of
rudeness
but
would
produce
it
if
it
pleased
her
the
situation
became
absurd
the
gentlemen
were
again
buzzing
round
miss
schlegel
with
offers
of
assistance
and
lady
edser
began
to
bind
up
her
hand
she
yielded
apologizing
slightly
and
was
led
back
to
the
car
and
soon
the
landscape
resumed
its
motion
the
lonely
cottage
disappeared
the
castle
swelled
on
its
cushion
of
turf
and
they
had
arrived
no
doubt
she
had
disgraced
herself
but
she
felt
their
whole
journey
from
london
had
been
unreal
they
had
no
part
with
the
earth
and
its
emotions
they
were
dust
and
a
stink
and
cosmopolitan
chatter
and
the
girl
whose
cat
had
been
killed
had
lived
more
deeply
than
they
oh
henry
she
exclaimed
i
have
been
so
naughty
for
she
had
decided
to
take
up
this
line
we
ran
over
a
cat
charles
told
me
not
to
jump
out
but
i
would
and
look
she
held
out
her
bandaged
hand
your
poor
meg
went
such
a
flop
wilcox
looked
bewildered
in
evening
dress
he
was
standing
to
welcome
his
guests
in
the
hall
thinking
it
was
a
dog
added
warrington
ah
a
dog
a
companion
said
colonel
fussell
a
dog
remember
you
have
you
hurt
yourself
margaret
not
to
speak
about
and
it
my
left
hand
well
hurry
up
and
change
she
obeyed
as
did
the
others
wilcox
then
turned
to
his
son
now
charles
what
happened
charles
was
absolutely
honest
he
described
what
he
believed
to
have
happened
albert
had
flattened
out
a
cat
and
miss
schlegel
had
lost
her
nerve
as
any
woman
might
she
had
been
got
safely
into
the
other
car
but
when
it
was
in
motion
had
leapt
out
again
in
spite
of
all
that
they
could
say
after
walking
a
little
on
the
road
she
had
calmed
down
and
had
said
that
she
was
sorry
his
father
accepted
this
explanation
and
neither
knew
that
margaret
had
artfully
prepared
the
way
for
it
it
fitted
in
too
well
with
their
view
of
feminine
nature
in
the
after
dinner
the
colonel
put
forward
the
view
that
miss
schlegel
had
jumped
it
out
of
devilry
well
he
remembered
as
a
young
man
in
the
harbour
of
gibraltar
once
how
a
girl
a
handsome
girl
too
had
jumped
overboard
for
a
bet
he
could
see
her
now
and
all
the
lads
overboard
after
her
but
charles
and
wilcox
agreed
it
was
much
more
probably
nerves
in
miss
schlegel
case
charles
was
depressed
that
woman
had
a
tongue
she
would
bring
worse
disgrace
on
his
father
before
she
had
done
with
them
he
strolled
out
on
to
the
castle
mound
to
think
the
matter
over
the
evening
was
exquisite
on
three
sides
of
him
a
little
river
whispered
full
of
messages
from
the
west
above
his
head
the
ruins
made
patterns
against
the
sky
he
carefully
reviewed
their
dealings
with
this
family
until
he
fitted
helen
and
margaret
and
aunt
juley
into
an
orderly
conspiracy
paternity
had
made
him
suspicious
he
had
two
children
to
look
after
and
more
coming
and
day
by
day
they
seemed
less
likely
to
grow
up
rich
men
it
is
all
very
well
he
reflected
the
pater
saying
that
he
will
be
just
to
all
but
one
ca
be
just
indefinitely
money
elastic
what
to
happen
if
evie
has
a
family
and
come
to
that
so
may
the
pater
there
not
be
enough
to
go
round
for
there
none
coming
in
either
through
dolly
or
percy
it
damnable
he
looked
enviously
at
the
grange
whose
windows
poured
light
and
laughter
first
and
last
this
wedding
would
cost
a
pretty
penny
two
ladies
were
strolling
up
and
down
the
garden
terrace
and
as
the
syllables
imperialism
were
wafted
to
his
ears
he
guessed
that
one
of
them
was
his
aunt
she
might
have
helped
him
if
she
too
had
not
had
a
family
to
provide
for
every
one
for
himself
he
repeated
a
maxim
which
had
cheered
him
in
the
past
but
which
rang
grimly
enough
among
the
ruins
of
oniton
he
lacked
his
father
ability
in
business
and
so
had
an
ever
higher
regard
for
money
unless
he
could
inherit
plenty
he
feared
to
leave
his
children
poor
as
he
sat
thinking
one
of
the
ladies
left
the
terrace
and
walked
into
the
meadow
he
recognized
her
as
margaret
by
the
white
bandage
that
gleamed
on
her
arm
and
put
out
his
cigar
lest
the
gleam
should
betray
him
she
climbed
up
the
mound
in
zigzags
and
at
times
stooped
down
as
if
she
was
stroking
the
turf
it
sounds
absolutely
incredible
but
for
a
moment
charles
thought
that
she
was
in
love
with
him
and
had
come
out
to
tempt
him
charles
believed
in
temptresses
who
are
indeed
the
strong
man
necessary
complement
and
having
no
sense
of
humour
he
could
not
purge
himself
of
the
thought
by
a
smile
margaret
who
was
engaged
to
his
father
and
his
sister
kept
on
her
way
without
noticing
him
and
he
admitted
that
he
had
wronged
her
on
this
point
but
what
was
she
doing
why
was
she
stumbling
about
amongst
the
rubble
and
catching
her
dress
in
brambles
and
burrs
as
she
edged
round
the
keep
she
must
have
got
to
leeward
and
smelt
his
for
she
exclaimed
hullo
who
that
charles
made
no
answer
saxon
or
kelt
she
continued
laughing
in
the
darkness
but
it
does
matter
whichever
you
are
you
will
have
to
listen
to
me
i
love
this
place
i
love
shropshire
i
hate
london
i
am
glad
that
this
will
be
my
home
ah
dear
she
was
now
moving
back
towards
the
house
what
a
comfort
to
have
arrived
that
woman
means
mischief
thought
charles
and
compressed
his
lips
in
a
few
minutes
he
followed
her
indoors
as
the
ground
was
getting
damp
mists
were
rising
from
the
river
and
presently
it
became
invisible
though
it
whispered
more
loudly
there
had
been
a
heavy
downpour
in
the
welsh
hills
chapter
next
morning
a
fine
mist
covered
the
peninsula
the
weather
promised
well
and
the
outline
of
the
castle
mound
grew
clearer
each
moment
that
margaret
watched
it
presently
she
saw
the
keep
and
the
sun
painted
the
rubble
gold
and
charged
the
white
sky
with
blue
the
shadow
of
the
house
gathered
itself
together
and
fell
over
the
garden
a
cat
looked
up
at
her
window
and
mewed
lastly
the
river
appeared
still
holding
the
mists
between
its
banks
and
its
overhanging
alders
and
only
visible
as
far
as
a
hill
which
cut
off
its
upper
reaches
margaret
was
fascinated
by
oniton
she
had
said
that
she
loved
it
but
it
was
rather
its
romantic
tension
that
held
her
the
rounded
druids
of
whom
she
had
caught
glimpses
in
her
drive
the
rivers
hurrying
down
from
them
to
england
the
carelessly
modelled
masses
of
the
lower
hills
thrilled
her
with
poetry
the
house
was
insignificant
but
the
prospect
from
it
would
be
an
eternal
joy
and
she
thought
of
all
the
friends
she
would
have
to
stop
in
it
and
of
the
conversion
of
henry
himself
to
a
rural
life
society
too
promised
favourably
the
rector
of
the
parish
had
dined
with
them
last
night
and
she
found
that
he
was
a
friend
of
her
father
and
so
knew
what
to
find
in
her
she
liked
him
he
would
introduce
her
to
the
town
while
on
her
other
side
sir
james
bidder
sat
repeating
that
she
only
had
to
give
the
word
and
he
would
whip
up
the
county
families
for
twenty
miles
round
whether
sir
james
who
was
garden
seeds
had
promised
what
he
could
perform
she
doubted
but
so
long
as
henry
mistook
them
for
the
county
families
when
they
did
call
she
was
content
charles
and
albert
fussell
now
crossed
the
lawn
they
were
going
for
a
morning
dip
and
a
servant
followed
them
with
their
she
had
meant
to
take
a
stroll
herself
before
breakfast
but
saw
that
the
day
was
still
sacred
to
men
and
amused
herself
by
watching
their
contretemps
in
the
first
place
the
key
of
the
could
not
be
found
charles
stood
by
the
riverside
with
folded
hands
tragical
while
the
servant
shouted
and
was
misunderstood
by
another
servant
in
the
garden
then
came
a
difficulty
about
a
and
soon
three
people
were
running
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
meadow
with
orders
and
counter
orders
and
recriminations
and
apologies
if
margaret
wanted
to
jump
from
a
she
jumped
if
tibby
thought
paddling
would
benefit
his
ankles
he
paddled
if
a
clerk
desired
adventure
he
took
a
walk
in
the
dark
but
these
athletes
seemed
paralysed
they
could
not
bathe
without
their
appliances
though
the
morning
sun
was
calling
and
the
last
mists
were
rising
from
the
dimpling
stream
had
they
found
the
life
of
the
body
after
all
could
not
the
men
whom
they
despised
as
milksops
beat
them
even
on
their
own
ground
she
thought
of
the
bathing
arrangements
as
they
should
be
in
her
day
no
worrying
of
servants
no
appliances
beyond
good
sense
her
reflections
were
disturbed
by
the
quiet
child
who
had
come
out
to
speak
to
the
cat
but
was
now
watching
her
watch
the
men
she
called
dear
a
little
sharply
her
voice
spread
consternation
charles
looked
round
and
though
completely
attired
in
indigo
blue
vanished
into
the
shed
and
was
seen
no
more
miss
wilcox
is
up
the
child
whispered
and
then
became
unintelligible
what
that
it
sounded
like
sack
back
i
ca
hear
on
the
bed
gathering
that
the
was
on
view
and
that
a
visit
would
be
seemly
she
went
to
evie
room
all
was
hilarity
here
evie
in
a
petticoat
was
dancing
with
one
of
the
ladies
while
the
other
was
adoring
yards
of
white
satin
they
screamed
they
laughed
they
sang
and
the
dog
barked
margaret
screamed
a
little
too
but
without
conviction
she
could
not
feel
that
a
wedding
was
so
funny
perhaps
something
was
missing
in
her
equipment
evie
gasped
dolly
is
a
rotter
not
to
be
here
oh
we
would
rag
just
then
then
margaret
went
down
to
breakfast
henry
was
already
installed
he
ate
slowly
and
spoke
little
and
was
in
margaret
eyes
the
only
member
of
their
party
who
dodged
emotion
successfully
she
could
not
suppose
him
indifferent
either
to
the
loss
of
his
daughter
or
to
the
presence
of
his
future
wife
yet
he
dwelt
intact
only
issuing
orders
occasionally
orders
that
promoted
the
comfort
of
his
guests
he
inquired
after
her
hand
he
set
her
to
pour
out
the
coffee
and
warrington
to
pour
out
the
tea
when
evie
came
down
there
was
a
awkwardness
and
both
ladies
rose
to
vacate
their
places
burton
called
henry
serve
tea
and
coffee
from
the
it
was
genuine
tact
but
it
was
tact
of
a
sort
the
sort
that
is
as
useful
as
the
genuine
and
saves
even
more
situations
at
board
meetings
henry
treated
a
marriage
like
a
funeral
item
by
item
never
raising
his
eyes
to
the
whole
and
death
where
is
thy
sting
love
where
is
thy
victory
one
would
exclaim
at
the
close
after
breakfast
she
claimed
a
few
words
with
him
it
was
always
best
to
approach
him
formally
she
asked
for
the
interview
because
he
was
going
on
to
shoot
grouse
tomorrow
and
she
was
returning
to
helen
in
town
certainly
dear
said
he
of
course
i
have
the
time
what
do
you
want
nothing
i
was
afraid
something
had
gone
wrong
no
i
have
nothing
to
say
but
you
may
talk
glancing
at
his
watch
he
talked
of
the
nasty
curve
at
the
she
heard
him
with
interest
her
surface
could
always
respond
to
his
without
contempt
though
all
her
deeper
being
might
be
yearning
to
help
him
she
had
abandoned
any
plan
of
action
love
is
the
best
and
the
more
she
let
herself
love
him
the
more
chance
was
there
that
he
would
set
his
soul
in
order
such
a
moment
as
this
when
they
sat
under
fair
weather
by
the
walks
of
their
future
home
was
so
sweet
to
her
that
its
sweetness
would
surely
pierce
to
him
each
lift
of
his
eyes
each
parting
of
the
thatched
lip
from
the
must
prelude
the
tenderness
that
kills
the
monk
and
the
beast
at
a
single
blow
disappointed
a
hundred
times
she
still
hoped
she
loved
him
with
too
clear
a
vision
to
fear
his
cloudiness
whether
he
droned
trivialities
as
today
or
sprang
kisses
on
her
in
the
twilight
she
could
pardon
him
she
could
respond
if
there
is
this
nasty
curve
she
suggested
we
walk
to
the
church
not
of
course
you
and
evie
but
the
rest
of
us
might
very
well
go
on
first
and
that
would
mean
fewer
carriages
one
ca
have
ladies
walking
through
the
market
square
the
fussells
would
like
it
they
were
awfully
particular
at
charles
wedding
my
she
one
of
our
party
was
anxious
to
walk
and
certainly
the
church
was
just
round
the
corner
and
i
should
have
minded
but
the
colonel
made
a
great
point
of
it
you
men
should
be
so
chivalrous
said
margaret
thoughtfully
why
not
she
knew
why
not
but
said
that
she
did
not
know
he
then
announced
that
unless
she
had
anything
special
to
say
he
must
visit
the
and
they
went
off
together
in
search
of
burton
though
clumsy
and
a
little
inconvenient
oniton
was
a
genuine
country
house
they
clattered
down
flagged
passages
looking
into
room
after
room
and
scaring
unknown
maids
from
the
performance
of
obscure
duties
the
must
be
in
readiness
when
they
came
back
from
church
and
tea
would
be
served
in
the
garden
the
sight
of
so
many
agitated
and
serious
people
made
margaret
smile
but
she
reflected
that
they
were
paid
to
be
serious
and
enjoyed
being
agitated
here
were
the
lower
wheels
of
the
machine
that
was
tossing
evie
up
into
nuptial
glory
a
little
boy
blocked
their
way
with
his
mind
could
not
grasp
their
greatness
and
he
said
by
your
leave
let
me
pass
please
henry
asked
him
where
burton
was
but
the
servants
were
so
new
that
they
did
not
know
one
another
names
in
the
sat
the
band
who
had
stipulated
for
champagne
as
part
of
their
fee
and
who
were
already
drinking
beer
scents
of
araby
came
from
the
kitchen
mingled
with
cries
margaret
knew
what
had
happened
there
for
it
happened
at
wickham
place
one
of
the
wedding
dishes
had
boiled
over
and
the
cook
was
throwing
to
hide
the
smell
at
last
they
came
upon
the
butler
henry
gave
him
the
keys
and
handed
margaret
down
the
two
doors
were
unlocked
she
who
kept
all
her
wine
at
the
bottom
of
the
was
astonished
at
the
sight
we
shall
never
get
through
it
she
cried
and
the
two
men
were
suddenly
drawn
into
brotherhood
and
exchanged
smiles
she
felt
as
if
she
had
again
jumped
out
of
the
car
while
it
was
moving
certainly
oniton
would
take
some
digesting
it
would
be
no
small
business
to
remain
herself
and
yet
to
assimilate
such
an
establishment
she
must
remain
herself
for
his
sake
as
well
as
her
own
since
a
shadowy
wife
degrades
the
husband
whom
she
accompanies
and
she
must
assimilate
for
reasons
of
common
honesty
since
she
had
no
right
to
marry
a
man
and
make
him
uncomfortable
her
only
ally
was
the
power
of
home
the
loss
of
wickham
place
had
taught
her
more
than
its
possession
howards
end
had
repeated
the
lesson
she
was
determined
to
create
new
sanctities
among
these
hills
after
visiting
the
she
dressed
and
then
came
the
wedding
which
seemed
a
small
affair
when
compared
with
the
preparations
for
it
everything
went
like
one
cahill
materialized
out
of
space
and
was
waiting
for
his
bride
at
the
church
door
no
one
dropped
the
ring
or
mispronounced
the
responses
or
trod
on
train
or
cried
in
a
few
minutes
the
clergymen
performed
their
duty
the
register
was
signed
and
they
were
back
in
their
carriages
negotiating
the
dangerous
curve
by
the
margaret
was
convinced
that
they
had
not
been
married
at
all
and
that
the
norman
church
had
been
intent
all
the
time
on
other
business
there
were
more
documents
to
sign
at
the
house
and
the
breakfast
to
eat
and
then
a
few
more
people
dropped
in
for
the
garden
party
there
had
been
a
great
many
refusals
and
after
all
it
was
not
a
very
big
affair
not
as
big
as
margaret
would
be
she
noted
the
dishes
and
the
strips
of
red
carpet
that
outwardly
she
might
give
henry
what
was
proper
but
inwardly
she
hoped
for
something
better
than
this
blend
of
sunday
church
and
if
only
someone
had
been
upset
but
this
wedding
had
gone
off
so
particularly
well
quite
like
a
durbar
in
the
opinion
of
lady
edser
and
she
thoroughly
agreed
with
her
so
the
wasted
day
lumbered
forward
the
bride
and
bridegroom
drove
off
yelling
with
laughter
and
for
the
second
time
the
sun
retreated
towards
the
hills
of
wales
henry
who
was
more
tired
than
he
owned
came
up
to
her
in
the
castle
meadow
and
in
tones
of
unusual
softness
said
that
he
was
pleased
everything
had
gone
off
so
well
she
felt
that
he
was
praising
her
too
and
blushed
certainly
she
had
done
all
she
could
with
his
intractable
friends
and
had
made
a
special
point
of
kowtowing
to
the
men
they
were
breaking
camp
this
evening
only
the
warringtons
and
quiet
child
would
stay
the
night
and
the
others
were
already
moving
towards
the
house
to
finish
their
packing
i
think
it
did
go
off
well
she
agreed
since
i
had
to
jump
out
of
the
motor
i
thankful
i
lighted
on
my
left
hand
i
am
so
very
glad
about
it
henry
dear
i
only
hope
that
the
guests
at
ours
may
be
half
as
comfortable
you
must
all
remember
that
we
have
no
practical
person
among
us
except
my
aunt
and
she
is
not
used
to
entertainments
on
a
large
scale
i
know
he
said
gravely
under
the
circumstances
it
would
be
better
to
put
everything
into
the
hands
of
or
whiteley
or
even
to
go
to
some
hotel
you
desire
a
hotel
yes
because
well
i
must
interfere
with
you
no
doubt
you
want
to
be
married
from
your
old
home
my
old
home
falling
into
pieces
henry
i
only
want
my
new
is
it
a
perfect
evening
the
alexandrina
is
bad
the
alexandrina
she
echoed
more
occupied
with
the
threads
of
smoke
that
were
issuing
from
their
chimneys
and
ruling
the
sunlit
slopes
with
parallels
of
grey
it
off
curzon
street
is
it
let
be
married
from
off
curzon
street
then
she
turned
westward
to
gaze
at
the
swirling
gold
just
where
the
river
rounded
the
hill
the
sun
caught
it
fairyland
must
lie
above
the
bend
and
its
precious
liquid
was
pouring
towards
them
past
charles
she
gazed
so
long
that
her
eyes
were
dazzled
and
when
they
moved
back
to
the
house
she
could
not
recognize
the
faces
of
people
who
were
coming
out
of
it
a
was
preceding
them
who
are
those
people
she
asked
they
callers
exclaimed
henry
it
too
late
for
callers
perhaps
they
town
people
who
want
to
see
the
wedding
presents
i
not
at
home
yet
to
townees
well
hide
among
the
ruins
and
if
i
can
stop
them
i
will
he
thanked
her
margaret
went
forward
smiling
socially
she
supposed
that
these
were
unpunctual
guests
who
would
have
to
be
content
with
vicarious
civility
since
evie
and
charles
were
gone
henry
tired
and
the
others
in
their
rooms
she
assumed
the
airs
of
a
hostess
not
for
long
for
one
of
the
group
was
helen
helen
in
her
oldest
clothes
and
dominated
by
that
tense
wounding
excitement
that
had
made
her
a
terror
in
their
nursery
days
what
is
it
she
called
oh
what
wrong
is
tibby
ill
helen
spoke
to
her
two
companions
who
fell
back
then
she
bore
forward
furiously
they
starving
she
shouted
i
found
them
starving
who
why
have
you
come
the
basts
oh
helen
moaned
margaret
whatever
have
you
done
now
he
has
lost
his
place
he
has
been
turned
out
of
his
bank
yes
he
done
for
we
upper
classes
have
ruined
him
and
i
suppose
you
tell
me
it
the
battle
of
life
starving
his
wife
is
ill
starving
she
fainted
in
the
train
helen
are
you
mad
perhaps
yes
if
you
like
i
mad
but
i
brought
them
i
stand
injustice
no
longer
i
show
up
the
wretchedness
that
lies
under
this
luxury
this
talk
of
impersonal
forces
this
cant
about
god
doing
what
we
too
slack
to
do
ourselves
have
you
actually
brought
two
starving
people
from
london
to
shropshire
helen
helen
was
checked
she
had
not
thought
of
this
and
her
hysteria
abated
there
was
a
restaurant
car
on
the
train
she
said
do
be
absurd
they
are
starving
and
you
know
it
now
begin
from
the
beginning
i
wo
have
such
theatrical
nonsense
how
dare
you
yes
how
dare
you
she
repeated
as
anger
filled
her
bursting
in
to
wedding
in
this
heartless
way
my
goodness
but
you
a
perverted
notion
of
philanthropy
look
she
indicated
the
house
servants
people
out
of
the
windows
they
think
it
some
vulgar
scandal
and
i
must
explain
no
only
my
sister
screaming
and
only
two
of
ours
whom
she
has
brought
here
for
no
conceivable
reason
kindly
take
back
that
word
said
helen
ominously
calm
very
well
conceded
margaret
who
for
all
her
wrath
was
determined
to
avoid
a
real
quarrel
i
too
am
sorry
about
them
but
it
beats
me
why
you
brought
them
here
or
why
you
here
yourself
it
our
last
chance
of
seeing
mr
wilcox
margaret
moved
towards
the
house
at
this
she
was
determined
not
to
worry
henry
he
going
to
scotland
i
know
he
is
i
insist
on
seeing
him
yes
tomorrow
i
knew
it
was
our
last
chance
how
do
you
do
mr
bast
said
margaret
trying
to
control
her
voice
this
is
an
odd
business
what
view
do
you
take
of
it
there
is
bast
too
prompted
helen
jacky
also
shook
hands
she
like
her
husband
was
shy
and
furthermore
ill
and
furthermore
so
bestially
stupid
that
she
could
not
grasp
what
was
happening
she
only
knew
that
the
lady
had
swept
down
like
a
whirlwind
last
night
had
paid
the
rent
redeemed
the
furniture
provided
them
with
a
dinner
and
breakfast
and
ordered
them
to
meet
her
at
paddington
next
morning
leonard
had
feebly
protested
and
when
the
morning
came
had
suggested
that
they
go
but
she
half
mesmerized
had
obeyed
the
lady
had
told
them
to
and
they
must
and
their
had
accordingly
changed
into
paddington
and
paddington
into
a
railway
carriage
that
shook
and
grew
hot
and
grew
cold
and
vanished
entirely
and
reappeared
amid
torrents
of
expensive
scent
you
have
fainted
said
the
lady
in
an
voice
perhaps
the
air
will
do
you
good
and
perhaps
it
had
for
here
she
was
feeling
rather
better
among
a
lot
of
flowers
i
sure
i
do
want
to
intrude
began
leonard
in
answer
to
margaret
question
but
you
have
been
so
kind
to
me
in
the
past
in
warning
me
about
the
porphyrion
that
i
wondered
why
i
wondered
whether
whether
we
could
get
him
back
into
the
porphyrion
again
supplied
helen
meg
this
has
been
a
cheerful
business
a
bright
evening
work
that
was
on
chelsea
embankment
margaret
shook
her
head
and
returned
to
bast
i
do
understand
you
left
the
porphyrion
because
we
suggested
it
was
a
bad
concern
did
you
that
right
and
went
into
a
bank
instead
i
told
you
all
that
said
helen
and
they
reduced
their
staff
after
he
had
been
in
a
month
and
now
penniless
and
i
consider
that
we
and
our
informant
are
directly
to
blame
i
hate
all
this
leonard
muttered
i
hope
you
do
bast
but
it
no
good
mincing
matters
you
have
done
yourself
no
good
by
coming
here
if
you
intend
to
confront
wilcox
and
to
call
him
to
account
for
a
chance
remark
you
will
make
a
very
great
mistake
i
brought
them
i
did
it
all
cried
helen
i
can
only
advise
you
to
go
at
once
my
sister
has
put
you
in
a
false
position
and
it
is
kindest
to
tell
you
so
it
too
late
to
get
to
town
but
you
find
a
comfortable
hotel
in
oniton
where
bast
can
rest
and
i
hope
be
my
guests
there
that
is
what
i
want
miss
schlegel
said
leonard
you
very
kind
and
no
doubt
it
a
false
position
but
you
make
me
miserable
i
seem
no
good
at
all
it
work
he
wants
interpreted
helen
ca
you
see
then
he
said
jacky
let
go
we
more
bother
than
we
worth
we
costing
these
ladies
pounds
and
pounds
already
to
get
work
for
us
and
they
never
will
nothing
we
good
enough
to
do
we
would
like
to
find
you
work
said
margaret
rather
conventionally
we
want
to
i
like
my
sister
only
down
in
your
luck
go
to
the
hotel
have
a
good
night
rest
and
some
day
you
shall
pay
me
back
the
bill
if
you
prefer
it
but
leonard
was
near
the
abyss
and
at
such
moments
men
see
clearly
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
he
said
i
shall
never
get
work
now
if
rich
people
fail
at
one
profession
they
can
try
another
not
i
had
my
groove
and
i
got
out
of
it
i
could
do
one
particular
branch
of
insurance
in
one
particular
office
well
enough
to
command
a
salary
but
that
all
poetry
nothing
miss
schlegel
one
thoughts
about
this
and
that
are
nothing
your
money
too
is
nothing
if
you
understand
me
i
mean
if
a
man
over
twenty
once
loses
his
own
particular
job
it
all
over
with
him
i
have
seen
it
happen
to
others
their
friends
gave
them
money
for
a
little
but
in
the
end
they
fall
over
the
edge
it
no
good
it
the
whole
world
pulling
there
always
will
be
rich
and
poor
he
ceased
wo
you
have
something
to
eat
said
margaret
i
do
know
what
to
do
it
is
my
house
and
though
wilcox
would
have
been
glad
to
see
you
at
any
other
time
as
i
say
i
do
know
what
to
do
but
i
undertake
to
do
what
i
can
for
you
helen
offer
them
something
do
try
a
sandwich
mrs
bast
they
moved
to
a
long
table
behind
which
a
servant
was
still
standing
iced
cakes
sandwiches
innumerable
coffee
champagne
remained
almost
intact
their
overfed
guests
could
do
no
more
leonard
refused
jacky
thought
she
could
manage
a
little
margaret
left
them
whispering
together
and
had
a
few
more
words
with
helen
she
said
helen
i
like
bast
i
agree
that
worth
helping
i
agree
that
we
are
directly
responsible
no
indirectly
via
mr
wilcox
let
me
tell
you
once
for
all
that
if
you
take
up
that
attitude
i
do
nothing
no
doubt
you
right
logically
and
are
entitled
to
say
a
great
many
scathing
things
about
henry
only
i
wo
have
it
so
choose
helen
looked
at
the
sunset
if
you
promise
to
take
them
quietly
to
the
george
i
will
speak
to
henry
about
them
in
my
own
way
mind
there
is
to
be
none
of
this
absurd
screaming
about
justice
i
have
no
use
for
justice
if
it
was
only
a
question
of
money
we
could
do
it
ourselves
but
he
wants
work
and
that
we
ca
give
him
but
possibly
henry
can
it
his
duty
to
grumbled
helen
nor
am
i
concerned
with
duty
i
concerned
with
the
characters
of
various
people
whom
we
know
and
how
things
being
as
they
are
things
may
be
made
a
little
better
wilcox
hates
being
asked
favours
all
business
men
do
but
i
am
going
to
ask
him
at
the
risk
of
a
rebuff
because
i
want
to
make
things
a
little
better
very
well
i
promise
you
take
it
very
take
them
off
to
the
george
then
and
i
try
poor
creatures
but
they
look
tried
as
they
parted
she
added
i
have
nearly
done
with
you
though
helen
you
have
been
most
i
ca
get
over
it
you
have
less
restraint
rather
than
more
as
you
grow
older
think
it
over
and
alter
yourself
or
we
sha
have
happy
lives
she
rejoined
henry
fortunately
he
had
been
sitting
down
these
physical
matters
were
important
was
it
townees
he
asked
greeting
her
with
a
pleasant
smile
you
never
believe
me
said
margaret
sitting
down
beside
him
it
all
right
now
but
it
was
my
sister
helen
here
he
cried
preparing
to
rise
but
she
refused
the
invitation
i
thought
she
despised
weddings
do
get
up
she
has
not
come
to
the
wedding
bundled
her
off
to
the
george
inherently
hospitable
he
protested
no
she
has
two
of
her
proteges
with
her
and
must
keep
with
them
let
all
come
my
dear
henry
did
you
see
them
i
did
catch
sight
of
a
brown
bunch
of
a
woman
certainly
the
brown
bunch
was
helen
but
did
you
catch
sight
of
a
and
salmon
bunch
what
are
they
out
beanfeasting
no
business
they
wanted
to
see
me
and
later
on
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
them
she
was
ashamed
of
her
own
diplomacy
in
dealing
with
a
wilcox
how
tempting
it
was
to
lapse
from
comradeship
and
to
give
him
the
kind
of
woman
that
he
desired
henry
took
the
hint
at
once
and
said
why
later
on
tell
me
now
no
time
like
the
present
shall
i
if
it
is
a
long
story
oh
not
five
minutes
but
there
a
sting
at
the
end
of
it
for
i
want
you
to
find
the
man
some
work
in
your
office
what
are
his
qualifications
i
do
know
he
a
clerk
how
old
perhaps
what
his
name
bast
said
margaret
and
was
about
to
remind
him
that
they
had
met
at
wickham
place
but
stopped
herself
it
had
not
been
a
successful
meeting
where
was
he
before
dempster
bank
why
did
he
leave
he
asked
still
remembering
nothing
they
reduced
their
staff
all
right
i
see
him
it
was
the
reward
of
her
tact
and
devotion
through
the
day
now
she
understood
why
some
women
prefer
influence
to
rights
plynlimmon
when
condemning
suffragettes
had
said
the
woman
who
ca
influence
her
husband
to
vote
the
way
she
wants
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
margaret
had
winced
but
she
was
influencing
henry
now
and
though
pleased
at
her
little
victory
she
knew
that
she
had
won
it
by
the
methods
of
the
harem
i
should
be
glad
if
you
took
him
she
said
but
i
do
know
whether
he
qualified
i
do
what
i
can
but
margaret
this
must
be
taken
as
a
precedent
no
of
course
of
course
i
ca
fit
in
your
proteges
every
day
business
would
suffer
i
can
promise
you
he
the
last
he
he
rather
a
special
case
proteges
always
are
she
let
it
stand
at
that
he
rose
with
a
little
extra
touch
of
complacency
and
held
out
his
hand
to
help
her
up
how
wide
the
gulf
between
henry
as
he
was
and
henry
as
helen
thought
he
ought
to
be
and
she
herself
hovering
as
usual
between
the
two
now
accepting
men
as
they
are
now
yearning
with
her
sister
for
truth
love
and
truth
their
warfare
seems
eternal
perhaps
the
whole
visible
world
rests
on
it
and
if
they
were
one
life
itself
like
the
spirits
when
prospero
was
reconciled
to
his
brother
might
vanish
into
air
into
thin
air
your
protege
has
made
us
late
said
he
the
fussells
will
just
be
starting
on
the
whole
she
sided
with
men
as
they
are
henry
would
save
the
basts
as
he
had
saved
howards
end
while
helen
and
her
friends
were
discussing
the
ethics
of
salvation
his
was
a
method
but
the
world
has
been
built
and
the
beauty
of
mountain
and
river
and
sunset
may
be
but
the
varnish
with
which
the
unskilled
artificer
hides
his
joins
oniton
like
herself
was
imperfect
its
were
stunted
its
castle
ruinous
it
too
had
suffered
in
the
border
warfare
between
the
anglo
saxon
and
the
kelt
between
things
as
they
are
and
as
they
ought
to
be
once
more
the
west
was
retreating
once
again
the
orderly
stars
were
dotting
the
eastern
sky
there
is
certainly
no
rest
for
us
on
the
earth
but
there
is
happiness
and
as
margaret
descended
the
mound
on
her
lover
arm
she
felt
that
she
was
having
her
share
to
her
annoyance
bast
was
still
in
the
garden
the
husband
and
helen
had
left
her
there
to
finish
her
meal
while
they
went
to
engage
rooms
margaret
found
this
woman
repellent
she
had
felt
when
shaking
her
hand
an
overpowering
shame
she
remembered
the
motive
of
her
call
at
wickham
place
and
smelt
again
odours
from
the
abyss
odours
the
more
disturbing
because
they
were
involuntary
for
there
was
no
malice
in
jacky
there
she
sat
a
piece
of
cake
in
one
hand
an
empty
champagne
glass
in
the
other
doing
no
harm
to
anybody
she
overtired
margaret
whispered
she
something
else
said
henry
this
wo
do
i
ca
have
her
in
my
garden
in
this
state
is
she
margaret
hesitated
to
add
drunk
now
that
she
was
going
to
marry
him
he
had
grown
particular
he
discountenanced
risque
conversations
now
henry
went
up
to
the
woman
she
raised
her
face
which
gleamed
in
the
twilight
like
a
madam
you
will
be
more
comfortable
at
the
hotel
he
said
sharply
jacky
replied
if
it
is
hen
ne
crois
pas
que
le
mari
lui
ressemble
apologized
margaret
il
est
tout
a
fait
different
henry
she
repeated
quite
distinctly
wilcox
was
much
annoyed
i
ca
congratulate
you
on
your
proteges
he
remarked
hen
do
go
you
do
love
me
dear
do
you
bless
us
what
a
person
sighed
margaret
gathering
up
her
skirts
jacky
pointed
with
her
cake
you
a
nice
boy
you
are
she
yawned
there
now
i
love
you
henry
i
am
awfully
sorry
and
pray
why
he
asked
and
looked
at
her
so
sternly
that
she
feared
he
was
ill
he
seemed
more
scandalized
than
the
facts
demanded
to
have
brought
this
down
on
you
pray
do
apologize
the
voice
continued
why
does
she
call
you
said
margaret
innocently
has
she
ever
seen
you
before
seen
hen
before
said
jacky
who
has
seen
hen
he
serving
you
like
me
my
dear
these
boys
you
wait
still
we
love
are
you
now
satisfied
henry
asked
margaret
began
to
grow
frightened
i
do
know
what
it
is
all
about
she
said
let
come
in
but
he
thought
she
was
acting
he
thought
he
was
trapped
he
saw
his
whole
life
crumbling
do
you
indeed
he
said
bitingly
i
do
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
on
the
success
of
your
plan
this
is
helen
plan
not
mine
i
now
understand
your
interest
in
the
basts
very
well
thought
out
i
am
amused
at
your
caution
margaret
you
are
quite
right
it
was
necessary
i
am
a
man
and
have
lived
a
man
past
i
have
the
honour
to
release
you
from
your
engagement
still
she
could
not
understand
she
knew
of
seamy
side
as
a
theory
she
could
not
grasp
it
as
a
fact
more
words
from
jacky
were
necessary
words
unequivocal
undenied
so
that
burst
from
her
and
she
went
indoors
she
stopped
herself
from
saying
more
so
what
asked
colonel
fussell
who
was
getting
ready
to
start
in
the
hall
we
were
saying
henry
and
i
were
just
having
the
fiercest
argument
my
point
being
seizing
his
fur
coat
from
a
footman
she
offered
to
help
him
on
he
protested
and
there
was
a
playful
little
scene
no
let
me
do
that
said
henry
following
thanks
so
much
you
see
he
has
forgiven
me
the
colonel
said
gallantly
i
do
expect
there
much
to
forgive
he
got
into
the
car
the
ladies
followed
him
after
an
interval
maids
courier
and
heavier
luggage
had
been
sent
on
earlier
by
the
branch
line
still
chattering
still
thanking
their
host
and
patronizing
their
future
hostess
the
guests
were
home
away
then
margaret
continued
so
that
woman
has
been
your
mistress
you
put
it
with
your
usual
delicacy
he
replied
when
please
why
when
please
ten
years
ago
she
left
him
without
a
word
for
it
was
not
her
tragedy
it
was
wilcox
chapter
helen
began
to
wonder
why
she
had
spent
a
matter
of
eight
pounds
in
making
some
people
ill
and
others
angry
now
that
the
wave
of
excitement
was
ebbing
and
had
left
her
bast
and
bast
stranded
for
the
night
in
a
shropshire
hotel
she
asked
herself
what
forces
had
made
the
wave
flow
at
all
events
no
harm
was
done
margaret
would
play
the
game
properly
now
and
though
helen
disapproved
of
her
sister
methods
she
knew
that
the
basts
would
benefit
by
them
in
the
long
run
wilcox
is
so
illogical
she
explained
to
leonard
who
had
put
his
wife
to
bed
and
was
sitting
with
her
in
the
empty
if
we
told
him
it
was
his
duty
to
take
you
on
he
might
refuse
to
do
it
the
fact
is
he
properly
educated
i
do
want
to
set
you
against
him
but
you
find
him
a
trial
i
can
never
thank
you
sufficiently
miss
schlegel
was
all
that
leonard
felt
equal
to
i
believe
in
personal
responsibility
do
you
and
in
personal
everything
i
hate
i
suppose
i
ought
to
say
that
but
the
wilcoxes
are
on
the
wrong
tack
surely
or
perhaps
it
is
their
fault
perhaps
the
little
thing
that
says
is
missing
out
of
the
middle
of
their
heads
and
then
it
a
waste
of
time
to
blame
them
there
a
nightmare
of
a
theory
that
says
a
special
race
is
being
born
which
will
rule
the
rest
of
us
in
the
future
just
because
it
lacks
the
little
thing
that
says
had
you
heard
that
i
get
no
time
for
reading
had
you
thought
it
then
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
people
our
kind
who
live
straight
from
the
middle
of
their
heads
and
the
other
kind
who
ca
because
their
heads
have
no
middle
they
ca
say
they
are
in
fact
and
so
they
supermen
pierpont
morgan
has
never
said
in
his
life
leonard
roused
himself
if
his
benefactress
wanted
intellectual
conversation
she
must
have
it
she
was
more
important
than
his
ruined
past
i
never
got
on
to
nietzsche
he
said
but
i
always
understood
that
those
supermen
were
rather
what
you
may
call
egoists
oh
no
that
wrong
replied
helen
no
superman
ever
said
want
because
want
must
lead
to
the
question
am
i
and
so
to
pity
and
to
justice
he
only
says
europe
if
he
napoleon
wives
if
he
bluebeard
botticelli
if
pierpont
morgan
never
the
and
if
you
could
pierce
through
him
you
find
panic
and
emptiness
in
the
middle
leonard
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
said
may
i
take
it
miss
schlegel
that
you
and
i
are
both
the
sort
that
say
of
course
and
your
sister
too
of
course
repeated
helen
a
little
sharply
she
was
annoyed
with
margaret
but
did
not
want
her
discussed
all
presentable
people
say
but
wilcox
he
is
not
perhaps
i
do
know
that
it
any
good
discussing
wilcox
either
quite
so
quite
so
he
agreed
helen
asked
herself
why
she
had
snubbed
him
once
or
twice
during
the
day
she
had
encouraged
him
to
criticize
and
then
had
pulled
him
up
short
was
she
afraid
of
him
presuming
if
so
it
was
disgusting
of
her
but
he
was
thinking
the
snub
quite
natural
everything
she
did
was
natural
and
incapable
of
causing
offence
while
the
miss
schlegels
were
together
he
had
felt
them
scarcely
human
a
sort
of
admonitory
whirligig
but
a
miss
schlegel
alone
was
different
she
was
in
helen
case
unmarried
in
margaret
about
to
be
married
in
neither
case
an
echo
of
her
sister
a
light
had
fallen
at
last
into
this
rich
upper
world
and
he
saw
that
it
was
full
of
men
and
women
some
of
whom
were
more
friendly
to
him
than
others
helen
had
become
his
miss
schlegel
who
scolded
him
and
corresponded
with
him
and
had
swept
down
yesterday
with
grateful
vehemence
margaret
though
not
unkind
was
severe
and
remote
he
would
not
presume
to
help
her
for
instance
he
had
never
liked
her
and
began
to
think
that
his
original
impression
was
true
and
that
her
sister
did
not
like
her
either
helen
was
certainly
lonely
she
who
gave
away
so
much
was
receiving
too
little
leonard
was
pleased
to
think
that
he
could
spare
her
vexation
by
holding
his
tongue
and
concealing
what
he
knew
about
wilcox
jacky
had
announced
her
discovery
when
he
fetched
her
from
the
lawn
after
the
first
shock
he
did
not
mind
for
himself
by
now
he
had
no
illusions
about
his
wife
and
this
was
only
one
new
stain
on
the
face
of
a
love
that
had
never
been
pure
to
keep
perfection
perfect
that
should
be
his
ideal
if
the
future
gave
him
time
to
have
ideals
helen
and
margaret
for
helen
sake
must
not
know
helen
disconcerted
him
by
fuming
the
conversation
to
his
wife
bast
does
she
ever
say
she
asked
half
mischievously
and
then
is
she
very
tired
it
better
she
stops
in
her
room
said
leonard
shall
i
sit
up
with
her
no
thank
you
she
does
not
need
company
bast
what
kind
of
woman
is
your
wife
leonard
blushed
up
to
his
eyes
you
ought
to
know
my
ways
by
now
does
that
question
offend
you
no
oh
no
miss
schlegel
no
because
i
love
honesty
do
pretend
your
marriage
has
been
a
happy
one
you
and
she
can
have
nothing
in
common
he
did
not
deny
it
but
said
shyly
i
suppose
pretty
obvious
but
jacky
never
meant
to
do
anybody
any
harm
when
things
went
wrong
or
i
heard
things
i
used
to
think
it
was
her
fault
but
looking
back
it
more
mine
i
need
have
married
her
but
as
i
have
i
must
stick
to
her
and
keep
her
how
long
have
you
been
married
nearly
three
years
what
did
your
people
say
they
will
not
have
anything
to
do
with
us
they
had
a
sort
of
family
council
when
they
heard
i
was
married
and
cut
us
off
altogether
helen
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
my
good
boy
what
a
mess
she
said
gently
who
are
your
people
he
could
answer
this
his
parents
who
were
dead
had
been
in
trade
his
sisters
had
married
commercial
travellers
his
brother
was
a
and
your
grandparents
leonard
told
her
a
secret
that
he
had
held
shameful
up
to
now
they
were
just
nothing
at
all
he
said
agricultural
labourers
and
that
sort
so
from
which
part
lincolnshire
mostly
but
my
mother
father
he
oddly
enough
came
from
these
parts
round
here
from
this
very
shropshire
yes
that
is
odd
my
mother
people
were
lancashire
but
why
do
your
brother
and
your
sisters
object
to
mrs
bast
oh
i
do
know
excuse
me
you
do
know
i
am
not
a
baby
i
can
bear
anything
you
tell
me
and
the
more
you
tell
the
more
i
shall
be
able
to
help
have
they
heard
anything
against
her
he
was
silent
i
think
i
have
guessed
now
said
helen
very
gravely
i
do
think
so
miss
schlegel
i
hope
not
we
must
be
honest
even
over
these
things
i
have
guessed
i
am
frightfully
dreadfully
sorry
but
it
does
not
make
the
least
difference
to
me
i
shall
feel
just
the
same
to
both
of
you
i
blame
not
your
wife
for
these
things
but
men
leonard
left
it
at
that
so
long
as
she
did
not
guess
the
man
she
stood
at
the
window
and
slowly
pulled
up
the
blinds
the
hotel
looked
over
a
dark
square
the
mists
had
begun
when
she
turned
back
to
him
her
eyes
were
shining
do
you
worry
he
pleaded
i
ca
bear
that
we
shall
be
all
right
if
i
get
work
if
i
could
only
get
work
something
regular
to
do
then
it
would
be
so
bad
again
i
do
trouble
after
books
as
i
used
i
can
imagine
that
with
regular
work
we
should
settle
down
again
it
stops
one
settle
down
to
what
oh
just
settle
down
and
that
to
be
life
said
helen
with
a
catch
in
her
throat
how
can
you
with
all
the
beautiful
things
to
see
and
do
with
music
with
walking
at
night
walking
is
well
enough
when
a
man
in
work
he
answered
oh
i
did
talk
a
lot
of
nonsense
once
but
there
nothing
like
a
bailiff
in
the
house
to
drive
it
out
of
you
when
i
saw
him
fingering
my
ruskins
and
stevensons
i
seemed
to
see
life
straight
real
and
it
is
a
pretty
sight
my
books
are
back
again
thanks
to
you
but
never
be
the
same
to
me
again
and
i
sha
ever
again
think
night
in
the
woods
is
wonderful
why
not
asked
helen
throwing
up
the
window
because
i
see
one
must
have
money
well
you
wrong
i
wish
i
was
wrong
but
the
clergyman
he
has
money
of
his
own
or
else
he
paid
the
poet
or
the
musician
just
the
same
the
tramp
he
no
different
the
tramp
goes
to
the
workhouse
in
the
end
and
is
paid
for
with
other
people
money
miss
schlegel
the
real
thing
money
and
all
the
rest
is
a
dream
you
still
wrong
you
forgotten
death
leonard
could
not
understand
if
we
lived
for
ever
what
you
say
would
be
true
but
we
have
to
die
we
have
to
leave
life
presently
injustice
and
greed
would
be
the
real
thing
if
we
lived
for
ever
as
it
is
we
must
hold
to
other
things
because
death
is
coming
i
love
death
not
morbidly
but
because
he
explains
he
shows
me
the
emptiness
of
money
death
and
money
are
the
eternal
foes
not
death
and
life
never
mind
what
lies
behind
death
bast
but
be
sure
that
the
poet
and
the
musician
and
the
tramp
will
be
happier
in
it
than
the
man
who
has
never
learnt
to
say
am
i
i
wonder
we
are
all
in
a
mist
i
know
but
i
can
help
you
this
far
men
like
the
wilcoxes
are
deeper
in
the
mist
than
any
sane
sound
englishmen
building
up
empires
levelling
all
the
world
into
what
they
call
common
sense
but
mention
death
to
them
and
they
offended
because
death
really
imperial
and
he
cries
out
against
them
for
ever
i
am
as
afraid
of
death
as
any
one
but
not
of
the
idea
of
death
but
what
is
the
difference
infinite
difference
said
helen
more
gravely
than
before
leonard
looked
at
her
wondering
and
had
the
sense
of
great
things
sweeping
out
of
the
shrouded
night
but
he
could
not
receive
them
because
his
heart
was
still
full
of
little
things
as
the
lost
umbrella
had
spoilt
the
concert
at
queen
hall
so
the
lost
situation
was
obscuring
the
diviner
harmonies
now
death
life
and
materialism
were
fine
words
but
would
wilcox
take
him
on
as
a
clerk
talk
as
one
would
wilcox
was
king
of
this
world
the
superman
with
his
own
morality
whose
head
remained
in
the
clouds
i
must
be
stupid
he
said
apologetically
while
to
helen
the
paradox
became
clearer
and
clearer
death
destroys
a
man
the
idea
of
death
saves
him
behind
the
coffins
and
the
skeletons
that
stay
the
vulgar
mind
lies
something
so
immense
that
all
that
is
great
in
us
responds
to
it
men
of
the
world
may
recoil
from
the
that
they
will
one
day
enter
but
love
knows
better
death
is
his
foe
but
his
peer
and
in
their
struggle
the
thews
of
love
have
been
strengthened
and
his
vision
cleared
until
there
is
no
one
who
can
stand
against
him
so
never
give
in
continued
the
girl
and
restated
again
and
again
the
vague
yet
convincing
plea
that
the
invisible
lodges
against
the
visible
her
excitement
grew
as
she
tried
to
cut
the
rope
that
fastened
leonard
to
the
earth
woven
of
bitter
experience
it
resisted
her
presently
the
waitress
entered
and
gave
her
a
letter
from
margaret
another
note
addressed
to
leonard
was
inside
they
read
them
listening
to
the
murmurings
of
the
river
chapter
for
many
hours
margaret
did
nothing
then
she
controlled
herself
and
wrote
some
letters
she
was
too
bruised
to
speak
to
henry
she
could
pity
him
and
even
determine
to
marry
him
but
as
yet
all
lay
too
deep
in
her
heart
for
speech
on
the
surface
the
sense
of
his
degradation
was
too
strong
she
could
not
command
voice
or
look
and
the
gentle
words
that
she
forced
out
through
her
pen
seemed
to
proceed
from
some
other
person
my
dearest
boy
she
began
this
is
not
to
part
us
it
is
everything
or
nothing
and
i
mean
it
to
be
nothing
it
happened
long
before
we
ever
met
and
even
if
it
had
happened
since
i
should
be
writing
the
same
i
hope
i
do
understand
but
she
crossed
out
i
do
understand
it
struck
a
false
note
henry
could
not
bear
to
be
understood
she
also
crossed
out
it
is
everything
or
nothing
henry
would
resent
so
strong
a
grasp
of
the
situation
she
must
not
comment
comment
is
unfeminine
i
think
that
about
do
she
thought
then
the
sense
of
his
degradation
choked
her
was
he
worth
all
this
bother
to
have
yielded
to
a
woman
of
that
sort
was
everything
yes
it
was
and
she
could
not
be
his
wife
she
tried
to
translate
his
temptation
into
her
own
language
and
her
brain
reeled
men
must
be
different
even
to
want
to
yield
to
such
a
temptation
her
belief
in
comradeship
was
stifled
and
she
saw
life
as
from
that
glass
saloon
on
the
great
western
which
sheltered
male
and
female
alike
from
the
fresh
air
are
the
sexes
really
races
each
with
its
own
code
of
morality
and
their
mutual
love
a
mere
device
of
nature
to
keep
things
going
strip
human
intercourse
of
the
proprieties
and
is
it
reduced
to
this
her
judgment
told
her
no
she
knew
that
out
of
device
we
have
built
a
magic
that
will
win
us
immortality
far
more
mysterious
than
the
call
of
sex
to
sex
is
the
tenderness
that
we
throw
into
that
call
far
wider
is
the
gulf
between
us
and
the
farmyard
than
between
the
and
the
garbage
that
nourishes
it
we
are
evolving
in
ways
that
science
can
not
measure
to
ends
that
theology
dares
not
contemplate
men
did
produce
one
jewel
the
gods
will
say
and
saying
will
give
us
immortality
margaret
knew
all
this
but
for
the
moment
she
could
not
feel
it
and
transformed
the
marriage
of
evie
and
cahill
into
a
carnival
of
fools
and
her
own
marriage
too
miserable
to
think
of
that
she
tore
up
the
letter
and
then
wrote
another
dear
bast
i
have
spoken
to
wilcox
about
you
as
i
promised
and
am
sorry
to
say
that
he
has
no
vacancy
for
you
yours
truly
schlegel
she
enclosed
this
in
a
note
to
helen
over
which
she
took
less
trouble
than
she
might
have
done
but
her
head
was
aching
and
she
could
not
stop
to
pick
her
words
dear
helen
give
him
this
the
basts
are
no
good
henry
found
the
woman
drunk
on
the
lawn
i
am
having
a
room
got
ready
for
you
here
and
will
you
please
come
round
at
once
on
getting
this
the
basts
are
not
at
all
the
type
we
should
trouble
about
i
may
go
round
to
them
myself
in
the
morning
and
do
anything
that
is
fair
m
in
writing
this
margaret
felt
that
she
was
being
practical
something
might
be
arranged
for
the
basts
later
on
but
they
must
be
silenced
for
the
moment
she
hoped
to
avoid
a
conversation
between
the
woman
and
helen
she
rang
the
bell
for
a
servant
but
no
one
answered
it
wilcox
and
the
warringtons
were
gone
to
bed
and
the
kitchen
was
abandoned
to
saturnalia
consequently
she
went
over
to
the
george
herself
she
did
not
enter
the
hotel
for
discussion
would
have
been
perilous
and
saying
that
the
letter
was
important
she
gave
it
to
the
waitress
as
she
recrossed
the
square
she
saw
helen
and
bast
looking
out
of
the
window
of
the
and
feared
she
was
already
too
late
her
task
was
not
yet
over
she
ought
to
tell
henry
what
she
had
done
this
came
easily
for
she
saw
him
in
the
hall
the
night
wind
had
been
rattling
the
pictures
against
the
wall
and
the
noise
had
disturbed
him
who
there
he
called
quite
the
householder
margaret
walked
in
and
past
him
i
have
asked
helen
to
sleep
she
said
she
is
best
here
so
do
lock
the
i
thought
someone
had
got
in
said
henry
at
the
same
time
i
told
the
man
that
we
could
do
nothing
for
him
i
do
know
about
later
but
now
the
basts
must
clearly
go
did
you
say
that
your
sister
is
sleeping
here
after
all
probably
is
she
to
be
shown
up
to
your
room
i
have
naturally
nothing
to
say
to
her
i
am
going
to
bed
will
you
tell
the
servants
about
helen
could
someone
go
to
carry
her
bag
he
tapped
a
little
gong
which
had
been
bought
to
summon
the
servants
you
must
make
more
noise
than
that
if
you
want
them
to
hear
henry
opened
a
door
and
down
the
corridor
came
shouts
of
laughter
far
too
much
screaming
there
he
said
and
strode
towards
it
margaret
went
upstairs
uncertain
whether
to
be
glad
that
they
had
met
or
sorry
they
had
behaved
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
her
deepest
instincts
told
her
that
this
was
wrong
for
his
own
sake
some
explanation
was
due
and
yet
what
could
an
explanation
tell
her
a
date
a
place
a
few
details
which
she
could
imagine
all
too
clearly
now
that
the
first
shock
was
over
she
saw
that
there
was
every
reason
to
premise
a
bast
inner
life
had
long
laid
open
to
her
his
intellectual
confusion
his
obtuseness
to
personal
influence
his
strong
but
furtive
passions
should
she
refuse
him
because
his
outer
life
corresponded
perhaps
perhaps
if
the
dishonour
had
been
done
to
her
but
it
was
done
long
before
her
day
she
struggled
against
the
feeling
she
told
herself
that
wilcox
wrong
was
her
own
but
she
was
not
a
bargain
theorist
as
she
undressed
her
anger
her
regard
for
the
dead
her
desire
for
a
scene
all
grew
weak
henry
must
have
it
as
he
liked
for
she
loved
him
and
some
day
she
would
use
her
love
to
make
him
a
better
man
pity
was
at
the
bottom
of
her
actions
all
through
this
crisis
pity
if
one
may
generalize
is
at
the
bottom
of
woman
when
men
like
us
it
is
for
our
better
qualities
and
however
tender
their
liking
we
dare
not
be
unworthy
of
it
or
they
will
quietly
let
us
go
but
unworthiness
stimulates
woman
it
brings
out
her
deeper
nature
for
good
or
for
evil
here
was
the
core
of
the
question
henry
must
be
forgiven
and
made
better
by
love
nothing
else
mattered
wilcox
that
unquiet
yet
kindly
ghost
must
be
left
to
her
own
wrong
to
her
everything
was
in
proportion
now
and
she
too
would
pity
the
man
who
was
blundering
up
and
down
their
lives
had
wilcox
known
of
his
trespass
an
interesting
question
but
margaret
fell
asleep
tethered
by
affection
and
lulled
by
the
murmurs
of
the
river
that
descended
all
the
night
from
wales
she
felt
herself
at
one
with
her
future
home
colouring
it
and
coloured
by
it
and
awoke
to
see
for
the
second
time
oniton
castle
conquering
the
morning
mists
chapter
henry
dear
was
her
greeting
he
had
finished
his
breakfast
and
was
beginning
the
times
his
was
packing
she
knelt
by
him
and
took
the
paper
from
him
feeling
that
it
was
unusually
heavy
and
thick
then
putting
her
face
where
it
had
been
she
looked
up
in
his
eyes
henry
dear
look
at
me
no
i
wo
have
you
shirking
look
at
me
there
that
all
you
referring
to
last
evening
he
said
huskily
i
have
released
you
from
your
engagement
i
could
find
excuses
but
i
wo
no
i
wo
a
thousand
times
no
i
a
bad
lot
and
must
be
left
at
that
expelled
from
his
old
fortress
wilcox
was
building
a
new
one
he
could
no
longer
appear
respectable
to
her
so
he
defended
himself
instead
in
a
lurid
past
it
was
not
true
repentance
leave
it
where
you
will
boy
it
not
going
to
trouble
us
i
know
what
i
talking
about
and
it
will
make
no
difference
no
difference
he
inquired
no
difference
when
you
find
that
i
am
not
the
fellow
you
thought
he
was
annoyed
with
miss
schlegel
here
he
would
have
preferred
her
to
be
prostrated
by
the
blow
or
even
to
rage
against
the
tide
of
his
sin
flowed
the
feeling
that
she
was
not
altogether
womanly
her
eyes
gazed
too
straight
they
had
read
books
that
are
suitable
for
men
only
and
though
he
had
dreaded
a
scene
and
though
she
had
determined
against
one
there
was
a
scene
all
the
same
it
was
somehow
imperative
i
am
unworthy
of
you
he
began
had
i
been
worthy
i
should
not
have
released
you
from
your
engagement
i
know
what
i
am
talking
about
i
ca
bear
to
talk
of
such
things
we
had
better
leave
she
kissed
his
hand
he
jerked
it
from
her
and
rising
to
his
feet
went
on
you
with
your
sheltered
life
and
refined
pursuits
and
friends
and
books
you
and
your
sister
and
women
like
you
i
say
how
can
you
guess
the
temptations
that
lie
round
a
man
it
is
difficult
for
us
said
margaret
but
if
we
are
worth
marrying
we
do
guess
cut
off
from
decent
society
and
family
ties
what
do
you
suppose
happens
to
thousands
of
young
fellows
overseas
isolated
no
one
near
i
know
by
bitter
experience
and
yet
you
say
it
makes
difference
not
to
me
he
laughed
bitterly
margaret
went
to
the
and
helped
herself
to
one
of
the
breakfast
dishes
being
the
last
down
she
turned
out
the
that
kept
them
warm
she
was
tender
but
grave
she
knew
that
henry
was
not
so
much
confessing
his
soul
as
pointing
out
the
gulf
between
the
male
soul
and
the
female
and
she
did
not
desire
to
hear
him
on
this
point
did
helen
come
she
asked
he
shook
his
head
but
that
wo
do
at
all
at
all
we
do
want
her
gossiping
with
mrs
bast
good
god
no
he
exclaimed
suddenly
natural
then
he
caught
himself
up
let
them
gossip
my
game
up
though
i
thank
you
for
your
unselfishness
little
as
my
thanks
are
worth
did
she
send
me
a
message
or
anything
i
heard
of
none
would
you
ring
the
bell
please
what
to
do
why
to
inquire
he
swaggered
up
to
it
tragically
and
sounded
a
peal
margaret
poured
herself
out
some
coffee
the
butler
came
and
said
that
miss
schlegel
had
slept
at
the
george
so
far
as
he
had
heard
should
he
go
round
to
the
george
i
go
thank
you
said
margaret
and
dismissed
him
it
is
no
good
said
henry
those
things
leak
out
you
can
not
stop
a
story
once
it
has
started
i
have
known
cases
of
other
men
i
despised
them
once
i
thought
that
different
i
shall
never
be
tempted
oh
margaret
he
came
and
sat
down
near
her
improvising
emotion
she
could
not
bear
to
listen
to
him
we
fellows
all
come
to
grief
once
in
our
time
will
you
believe
that
there
are
moments
when
the
strongest
man
him
who
standeth
take
heed
lest
he
fall
that
true
is
it
if
you
knew
all
you
would
excuse
me
i
was
far
from
good
influences
far
even
from
england
i
was
very
very
lonely
and
longed
for
a
woman
voice
that
enough
i
have
told
you
too
much
already
for
you
to
forgive
me
now
yes
that
enough
dear
i
have
he
lowered
his
voice
i
have
been
through
hell
gravely
she
considered
this
claim
had
he
had
he
suffered
tortures
of
remorse
or
had
it
been
there
that
over
now
for
respectable
life
again
the
latter
if
she
read
him
rightly
a
man
who
has
been
through
hell
does
not
boast
of
his
virility
he
is
humble
and
hides
it
if
indeed
it
still
exists
only
in
legend
does
the
sinner
come
forth
penitent
but
terrible
to
conquer
pure
woman
by
his
resistless
power
henry
was
anxious
to
be
terrible
but
had
not
got
it
in
him
he
was
a
good
average
englishman
who
had
slipped
the
really
culpable
point
his
faithlessness
to
wilcox
never
seemed
to
strike
him
she
longed
to
mention
wilcox
and
bit
by
bit
the
story
was
told
her
it
was
a
very
simple
story
ten
years
ago
was
the
time
a
garrison
town
in
cyprus
the
place
now
and
then
he
asked
her
whether
she
could
possibly
forgive
him
and
she
answered
i
have
already
forgiven
you
henry
she
chose
her
words
carefully
and
so
saved
him
from
panic
she
played
the
girl
until
he
could
rebuild
his
fortress
and
hide
his
soul
from
the
world
when
the
butler
came
to
clear
away
henry
was
in
a
very
different
mood
asked
the
fellow
what
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
for
complained
of
the
noise
last
night
in
the
servants
hall
margaret
looked
intently
at
the
butler
he
as
a
handsome
young
man
was
faintly
attractive
to
her
as
a
woman
an
attraction
so
faint
as
scarcely
to
be
perceptible
yet
the
skies
would
have
fallen
if
she
had
mentioned
it
to
henry
on
her
return
from
the
george
the
building
operations
were
complete
and
the
old
henry
fronted
her
competent
cynical
and
kind
he
had
made
a
clean
breast
had
been
forgiven
and
the
great
thing
now
was
to
forget
his
failure
and
to
send
it
the
way
of
other
unsuccessful
investments
jacky
rejoined
howards
end
and
ducie
street
and
the
vermilion
and
the
argentine
hard
dollars
and
all
the
things
and
people
for
whom
he
had
never
had
much
use
and
had
less
now
their
memory
hampered
him
he
could
scarcely
attend
to
margaret
who
brought
back
disquieting
news
from
the
george
helen
and
her
clients
had
gone
well
let
them
go
the
man
and
his
wife
i
mean
for
the
more
we
see
of
your
sister
the
better
but
they
have
gone
separately
helen
very
early
the
basts
just
before
i
arrived
they
have
left
no
message
they
have
answered
neither
of
my
notes
i
do
like
to
think
what
it
all
means
what
did
you
say
in
the
notes
i
told
you
last
night
oh
ah
yes
dear
would
you
like
one
turn
in
the
garden
margaret
took
his
arm
the
beautiful
weather
soothed
her
but
the
wheels
of
evie
wedding
were
still
at
work
tossing
the
guests
outwards
as
deftly
as
they
had
drawn
them
in
and
she
could
not
be
with
him
long
it
had
been
arranged
that
they
should
motor
to
shrewsbury
whence
he
would
go
north
and
she
back
to
london
with
the
warringtons
for
a
fraction
of
time
she
was
happy
then
her
brain
recommenced
i
am
afraid
there
has
been
gossiping
of
some
kind
at
the
george
helen
would
not
have
left
unless
she
had
heard
something
i
mismanaged
that
it
is
wretched
i
ought
to
have
parted
her
from
that
woman
at
once
margaret
he
exclaimed
loosing
her
arm
impressively
yes
yes
henry
i
am
far
from
a
saint
in
fact
the
reverse
but
you
have
taken
me
for
better
or
worse
bygones
must
be
bygones
you
have
promised
to
forgive
me
margaret
a
promise
is
a
promise
never
mention
that
woman
again
except
for
some
practical
reason
never
practical
you
practical
yes
i
practical
she
murmured
stooping
over
the
and
playing
with
the
grass
which
trickled
through
her
fingers
like
sand
he
had
silenced
her
but
her
fears
made
him
uneasy
not
for
the
first
time
he
was
threatened
with
blackmail
he
was
rich
and
supposed
to
be
moral
the
basts
knew
that
he
was
not
and
might
find
it
profitable
to
hint
as
much
at
all
events
you
must
worry
he
said
this
is
a
man
business
he
thought
intently
on
no
account
mention
it
to
anybody
margaret
flushed
at
advice
so
elementary
but
he
was
really
paving
the
way
for
a
lie
if
necessary
he
would
deny
that
he
had
ever
known
bast
and
prosecute
her
for
libel
perhaps
he
never
had
known
her
here
was
margaret
who
behaved
as
if
he
had
not
there
the
house
round
them
were
half
a
dozen
gardeners
clearing
up
after
his
daughter
wedding
all
was
so
solid
and
spruce
that
the
past
flew
up
out
of
sight
like
a
leaving
only
the
last
five
minutes
unrolled
glancing
at
these
he
saw
that
the
car
would
be
round
during
the
next
five
and
plunged
into
action
gongs
were
tapped
orders
issued
margaret
was
sent
to
dress
and
the
housemaid
to
sweep
up
the
long
trickle
of
grass
that
she
had
left
across
the
hall
as
is
man
to
the
universe
so
was
the
mind
of
wilcox
to
the
minds
of
some
men
a
concentrated
light
upon
a
tiny
spot
a
little
ten
minutes
moving
through
its
appointed
years
no
pagan
he
who
lives
for
the
now
and
may
be
wiser
than
all
philosophers
he
lived
for
the
five
minutes
that
have
past
and
the
five
to
come
he
had
the
business
mind
how
did
he
stand
now
as
his
motor
slipped
out
of
oniton
and
breasted
the
great
round
hills
margaret
had
heard
a
certain
rumour
but
was
all
right
she
had
forgiven
him
god
bless
her
and
he
felt
the
manlier
for
it
charles
and
evie
had
not
heard
it
and
never
must
hear
no
more
must
paul
over
his
children
he
felt
great
tenderness
which
he
did
not
try
to
track
to
a
cause
wilcox
was
too
far
back
in
his
life
he
did
not
connect
her
with
the
sudden
aching
love
that
he
felt
for
evie
poor
little
evie
he
trusted
that
cahill
would
make
her
a
decent
husband
and
margaret
how
did
she
stand
she
had
several
minor
worries
clearly
her
sister
had
heard
something
she
dreaded
meeting
her
in
town
and
she
was
anxious
about
leonard
for
whom
they
certainly
were
responsible
nor
ought
bast
to
starve
but
the
main
situation
had
not
altered
she
still
loved
henry
his
actions
not
his
disposition
had
disappointed
her
and
she
could
bear
that
and
she
loved
her
future
home
standing
up
in
the
car
just
where
she
had
leapt
from
it
two
days
before
she
gazed
back
with
deep
emotion
upon
oniton
besides
the
grange
and
the
castle
keep
she
could
now
pick
out
the
church
and
the
gables
of
the
george
there
was
the
bridge
and
the
river
nibbling
its
green
peninsula
she
could
even
see
the
but
while
she
was
looking
for
charles
new
springboard
the
forehead
of
the
hill
rose
up
and
hid
the
whole
scene
she
never
saw
it
again
day
and
night
the
river
flows
down
into
england
day
after
day
the
sun
retreats
into
the
welsh
mountains
and
the
tower
chimes
see
the
conquering
hero
but
the
wilcoxes
have
no
part
in
the
place
nor
in
any
place
it
is
not
their
names
that
recur
in
the
parish
register
it
is
not
their
ghosts
that
sigh
among
the
alders
at
evening
they
have
swept
into
the
valley
and
swept
out
of
it
leaving
a
little
dust
and
a
little
money
behind
chapter
tibby
was
now
approaching
his
last
year
at
oxford
he
had
moved
out
of
college
and
was
contemplating
the
universe
or
such
portions
of
it
as
concerned
him
from
his
comfortable
lodgings
in
long
wall
he
was
not
concerned
with
much
when
a
young
man
is
untroubled
by
passions
and
sincerely
indifferent
to
public
opinion
his
outlook
is
necessarily
limited
tibby
neither
wished
to
strengthen
the
position
of
the
rich
nor
to
improve
that
of
the
poor
and
so
was
well
content
to
watch
the
elms
nodding
behind
the
mildly
embattled
parapets
of
magdalen
there
are
worse
lives
though
selfish
he
was
never
cruel
though
affected
in
manner
he
never
posed
like
margaret
he
disdained
the
heroic
equipment
and
it
was
only
after
many
visits
that
men
discovered
schlegel
to
possess
a
character
and
a
brain
he
had
done
well
in
mods
much
to
the
surprise
of
those
who
attended
lectures
and
took
proper
exercise
and
was
now
glancing
disdainfully
at
chinese
in
case
he
should
some
day
consent
to
qualify
as
a
student
interpreter
to
him
thus
employed
helen
entered
a
telegram
had
preceded
her
he
noticed
in
a
distant
way
that
his
sister
had
altered
as
a
rule
he
found
her
too
pronounced
and
had
never
come
across
this
look
of
appeal
pathetic
yet
dignified
the
look
of
a
sailor
who
has
lost
everything
at
sea
i
have
come
from
oniton
she
began
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
trouble
there
who
for
lunch
said
tibby
picking
up
the
claret
which
was
warming
in
the
hearth
helen
sat
down
submissively
at
the
table
why
such
an
early
start
he
asked
sunrise
or
something
when
i
could
get
away
so
i
surmise
why
i
do
know
what
to
be
done
tibby
i
am
very
much
upset
at
a
piece
of
news
that
concerns
meg
and
do
not
want
to
face
her
and
i
am
not
going
back
to
wickham
place
i
stopped
here
to
tell
you
this
the
landlady
came
in
with
the
cutlets
tibby
put
a
marker
in
the
leaves
of
his
chinese
grammar
and
helped
them
oxford
the
oxford
of
the
vacation
dreamed
and
rustled
outside
and
indoors
the
little
fire
was
coated
with
grey
where
the
sunshine
touched
it
helen
continued
her
odd
story
give
meg
my
love
and
say
that
i
want
to
be
alone
i
mean
to
go
to
munich
or
else
bonn
such
a
message
is
easily
given
said
her
brother
as
regards
wickham
place
and
my
share
of
the
furniture
you
and
she
are
to
do
exactly
as
you
like
my
own
feeling
is
that
everything
may
just
as
well
be
sold
what
does
one
want
with
dusty
economic
books
which
have
made
the
world
no
better
or
with
mother
hideous
chiffoniers
i
have
also
another
commission
for
you
i
want
you
to
deliver
a
letter
she
got
up
i
have
written
it
yet
why
should
i
post
it
though
she
sat
down
again
my
head
is
rather
wretched
i
hope
that
none
of
your
friends
are
likely
to
come
in
tibby
locked
the
door
his
friends
often
found
it
in
this
condition
then
he
asked
whether
anything
had
gone
wrong
at
evie
wedding
not
there
said
helen
and
burst
into
tears
he
had
known
her
hysterical
it
was
one
of
her
aspects
with
which
he
had
no
concern
and
yet
these
tears
touched
him
as
something
unusual
they
were
nearer
the
things
that
did
concern
him
such
as
music
he
laid
down
his
knife
and
looked
at
her
curiously
then
as
she
continued
to
sob
he
went
on
with
his
lunch
the
time
came
for
the
second
course
and
she
was
still
crying
apple
charlotte
was
to
follow
which
spoils
by
waiting
do
you
mind
martlett
coming
in
he
asked
or
shall
i
take
it
from
her
at
the
door
could
i
bathe
my
eyes
tibby
he
took
her
to
his
bedroom
and
introduced
the
pudding
in
her
absence
having
helped
himself
he
put
it
down
to
warm
in
the
hearth
his
hand
stretched
towards
the
grammar
and
soon
he
was
turning
over
the
pages
raising
his
eyebrows
scornfully
perhaps
at
human
nature
perhaps
at
chinese
to
him
thus
employed
helen
returned
she
had
pulled
herself
together
but
the
grave
appeal
had
not
vanished
from
her
eyes
now
for
the
explanation
she
said
why
did
i
begin
with
it
i
have
found
out
something
about
wilcox
he
has
behaved
very
wrongly
indeed
and
ruined
two
people
lives
it
all
came
on
me
very
suddenly
last
night
i
am
very
much
upset
and
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
bast
oh
those
people
helen
seemed
silenced
shall
i
lock
the
door
again
no
thanks
tibbikins
you
being
very
good
to
me
i
want
to
tell
you
the
story
before
i
go
abroad
you
must
do
exactly
what
you
like
treat
it
as
part
of
the
furniture
meg
can
not
have
heard
it
yet
i
think
but
i
can
not
face
her
and
tell
her
that
the
man
she
is
going
to
marry
has
misconducted
himself
i
do
even
know
whether
she
ought
to
be
told
knowing
as
she
does
that
i
dislike
him
she
will
suspect
me
and
think
that
i
want
to
ruin
her
match
i
simply
do
know
what
to
make
of
such
a
thing
i
trust
your
judgment
what
would
you
do
i
gather
he
has
had
a
mistress
said
tibby
helen
flushed
with
shame
and
anger
and
ruined
two
people
lives
and
goes
about
saying
that
personal
actions
count
for
nothing
and
there
always
will
be
rich
and
poor
he
met
her
when
he
was
trying
to
get
rich
out
in
cyprus
i
do
wish
to
make
him
worse
than
he
is
and
no
doubt
she
was
ready
enough
to
meet
him
but
there
it
is
they
met
he
goes
his
way
and
she
goes
hers
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
end
of
such
women
he
conceded
that
it
was
a
bad
business
they
end
in
two
ways
either
they
sink
till
the
lunatic
asylums
and
the
workhouses
are
full
of
them
and
cause
wilcox
to
write
letters
to
the
papers
complaining
of
our
national
degeneracy
or
else
they
entrap
a
boy
into
marriage
before
it
is
too
late
she
i
ca
blame
her
but
this
is
all
she
continued
after
a
long
pause
during
which
the
landlady
served
them
with
coffee
i
come
now
to
the
business
that
took
us
to
oniton
we
went
all
three
acting
on
wilcox
advice
the
man
throws
up
a
secure
situation
and
takes
an
insecure
one
from
which
he
is
dismissed
there
are
certain
excuses
but
in
the
main
wilcox
is
to
blame
as
meg
herself
admitted
it
is
only
common
justice
that
he
should
employ
the
man
himself
but
he
meets
the
woman
and
like
the
cur
that
he
is
he
refuses
and
tries
to
get
rid
of
them
he
makes
meg
write
two
notes
came
from
her
late
that
evening
one
for
me
one
for
leonard
dismissing
him
with
barely
a
reason
i
could
understand
then
it
comes
out
that
bast
had
spoken
to
wilcox
on
the
lawn
while
we
left
her
to
get
rooms
and
was
still
speaking
about
him
when
leonard
came
back
to
her
this
leonard
knew
all
along
he
thought
it
natural
he
should
be
ruined
twice
natural
could
you
have
contained
yourself
it
is
certainly
a
very
bad
business
said
tibby
his
reply
seemed
to
calm
his
sister
i
was
afraid
that
i
saw
it
out
of
proportion
but
you
are
right
outside
it
and
you
must
know
in
a
day
or
two
or
perhaps
a
week
take
whatever
steps
you
think
fit
i
leave
it
in
your
hands
she
concluded
her
charge
the
facts
as
they
touch
meg
are
all
before
you
she
added
and
tibby
sighed
and
felt
it
rather
hard
that
because
of
his
open
mind
he
should
be
empanelled
to
serve
as
a
juror
he
had
never
been
interested
in
human
beings
for
which
one
must
blame
him
but
he
had
had
rather
too
much
of
them
at
wickham
place
just
as
some
people
cease
to
attend
when
books
are
mentioned
so
tibby
attention
wandered
when
personal
relations
came
under
discussion
ought
margaret
to
know
what
helen
knew
the
basts
to
know
similar
questions
had
vexed
him
from
infancy
and
at
oxford
he
had
learned
to
say
that
the
importance
of
human
beings
has
been
vastly
overrated
by
specialists
the
epigram
with
its
faint
whiff
of
the
eighties
meant
nothing
but
he
might
have
let
it
off
now
if
his
sister
had
not
been
ceaselessly
beautiful
you
see
helen
have
a
cigarette
i
do
see
what
to
do
then
there
nothing
to
be
done
i
dare
say
you
are
right
let
them
marry
there
remains
the
question
of
do
you
want
me
to
adjudicate
that
too
had
you
not
better
consult
an
expert
this
part
is
in
confidence
said
helen
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
meg
and
do
not
mention
it
to
her
the
compensation
i
do
not
see
who
is
to
pay
it
if
i
do
and
i
have
already
decided
on
the
minimum
sum
as
soon
as
possible
i
am
placing
it
to
your
account
and
when
i
am
in
germany
you
will
pay
it
over
for
me
i
shall
never
forget
your
kindness
tibbikins
if
you
do
this
what
is
the
sum
five
thousand
good
god
alive
said
tibby
and
went
crimson
now
what
is
the
good
of
driblets
to
go
through
life
having
done
one
thing
to
have
raised
one
person
from
the
abyss
not
these
puny
gifts
of
shillings
and
blankets
making
the
grey
more
grey
no
doubt
people
will
think
me
extraordinary
i
do
care
a
damn
what
people
think
cried
he
heated
to
unusual
manliness
of
diction
but
it
half
what
you
have
not
nearly
half
she
spread
out
her
hands
over
her
soiled
skirt
i
have
far
too
much
and
we
settled
at
chelsea
last
spring
that
three
hundred
a
year
is
necessary
to
set
a
man
on
his
feet
what
i
give
will
bring
in
a
hundred
and
fifty
between
two
it
is
enough
he
could
not
recover
he
was
not
angry
or
even
shocked
and
he
saw
that
helen
would
still
have
plenty
to
live
on
but
it
amazed
him
to
think
what
haycocks
people
can
make
of
their
lives
his
delicate
intonations
would
not
work
and
he
could
only
blurt
out
that
the
five
thousand
pounds
would
mean
a
great
deal
of
bother
for
him
personally
i
did
expect
you
to
understand
me
i
i
understand
nobody
but
you
do
it
apparently
i
leave
you
two
commissions
then
the
first
concerns
wilcox
and
you
are
to
use
your
discretion
the
second
concerns
the
money
and
is
to
be
mentioned
to
no
one
and
carried
out
literally
you
will
send
a
hundred
pounds
on
account
tomorrow
he
walked
with
her
to
the
station
passing
through
those
streets
whose
serried
beauty
never
bewildered
him
and
never
fatigued
the
lovely
creature
raised
domes
and
spires
into
the
cloudless
blue
and
only
the
ganglion
of
vulgarity
round
carfax
showed
how
evanescent
was
the
phantom
how
faint
its
claim
to
represent
england
helen
rehearsing
her
commission
noticed
nothing
the
basts
were
in
her
brain
and
she
retold
the
crisis
in
a
meditative
way
which
might
have
made
other
men
curious
she
was
seeing
whether
it
would
hold
he
asked
her
once
why
she
had
taken
the
basts
right
into
the
heart
of
evie
wedding
she
stopped
like
a
frightened
animal
and
said
does
that
seem
to
you
so
odd
her
eyes
the
hand
laid
on
the
mouth
quite
haunted
him
until
they
were
absorbed
into
the
figure
of
mary
the
virgin
before
whom
he
paused
for
a
moment
on
the
walk
home
it
is
convenient
to
follow
him
in
the
discharge
of
his
duties
margaret
summoned
him
the
next
day
she
was
terrified
at
helen
flight
and
he
had
to
say
that
she
had
called
in
at
oxford
then
she
said
did
she
seem
worried
at
any
rumour
about
henry
he
answered
yes
i
knew
it
was
that
she
exclaimed
i
write
to
her
tibby
was
relieved
he
then
sent
the
cheque
to
the
address
that
helen
gave
him
and
stated
that
later
on
he
was
instructed
to
forward
five
thousand
pounds
an
answer
came
back
very
civil
and
quiet
in
tone
such
an
answer
as
tibby
himself
would
have
given
the
cheque
was
returned
the
legacy
refused
the
writer
being
in
no
need
of
money
tibby
forwarded
this
to
helen
adding
in
the
fulness
of
his
heart
that
leonard
bast
seemed
somewhat
a
monumental
person
after
all
reply
was
frantic
he
was
to
take
no
notice
he
was
to
go
down
at
once
and
say
that
she
commanded
acceptance
he
went
a
scurf
of
books
and
china
ornaments
awaited
them
the
basts
had
just
been
evicted
for
not
paying
their
rent
and
had
wandered
no
one
knew
whither
helen
had
begun
bungling
with
her
money
by
this
time
and
had
even
sold
out
her
shares
in
the
nottingham
and
derby
railway
for
some
weeks
she
did
nothing
then
she
reinvested
and
owing
to
the
good
advice
of
her
stockbrokers
became
rather
richer
than
she
had
been
before
chapter
houses
have
their
own
ways
of
dying
falling
as
variously
as
the
generations
of
men
some
with
a
tragic
roar
some
quietly
but
to
an
in
the
city
of
ghosts
while
from
others
and
thus
was
the
death
of
wickham
place
the
spirit
slips
before
the
body
perishes
it
had
decayed
in
the
spring
disintegrating
the
girls
more
than
they
knew
and
causing
either
to
accost
unfamiliar
regions
by
september
it
was
a
corpse
void
of
emotion
and
scarcely
hallowed
by
the
memories
of
thirty
years
of
happiness
through
its
doorway
passed
furniture
and
pictures
and
books
until
the
last
room
was
gutted
and
the
last
van
had
rumbled
away
it
stood
for
a
week
or
two
longer
as
if
astonished
at
its
own
emptiness
then
it
fell
navvies
came
and
spilt
it
back
into
the
grey
with
their
muscles
and
their
beery
good
temper
they
were
not
the
worst
of
undertakers
for
a
house
which
had
always
been
human
and
had
not
mistaken
culture
for
an
end
the
furniture
with
a
few
exceptions
went
down
into
hertfordshire
wilcox
having
most
kindly
offered
howards
end
as
a
warehouse
bryce
had
died
abroad
an
unsatisfactory
affair
and
as
there
seemed
little
guarantee
that
the
rent
would
be
paid
regularly
he
cancelled
the
agreement
and
resumed
possession
himself
until
he
relet
the
house
the
schlegels
were
welcome
to
stack
their
furniture
in
the
garage
and
lower
rooms
margaret
demurred
but
tibby
accepted
the
offer
gladly
it
saved
him
from
coming
to
any
decision
about
the
future
the
plate
and
the
more
valuable
pictures
found
a
safer
home
in
london
but
the
bulk
of
the
things
went
and
were
entrusted
to
the
guardianship
of
miss
avery
shortly
before
the
move
our
hero
and
heroine
were
married
they
have
weathered
the
storm
and
may
reasonably
expect
peace
to
have
no
illusions
and
yet
to
love
what
stronger
surety
can
a
woman
find
she
had
seen
her
husband
past
as
well
as
his
heart
she
knew
her
own
heart
with
a
thoroughness
that
commonplace
people
believe
impossible
the
heart
of
wilcox
was
alone
hidden
and
perhaps
it
is
superstitious
to
speculate
on
the
feelings
of
the
dead
they
were
married
quietly
really
quietly
for
as
the
day
approached
she
refused
to
go
through
another
oniton
her
brother
gave
her
away
her
aunt
who
was
out
of
health
presided
over
a
few
colourless
refreshments
the
wilcoxes
were
represented
by
charles
who
witnessed
the
marriage
settlement
and
by
cahill
paul
did
send
a
cablegram
in
a
few
minutes
and
without
the
aid
of
music
the
clergyman
made
them
man
and
wife
and
soon
the
glass
shade
had
fallen
that
cuts
off
married
couples
from
the
world
she
a
monogamist
regretted
the
cessation
of
some
of
life
innocent
odours
he
whose
instincts
were
polygamous
felt
morally
braced
by
the
change
and
less
liable
to
the
temptations
that
had
assailed
him
in
the
past
they
spent
their
honeymoon
near
innsbruck
henry
knew
of
a
reliable
hotel
there
and
margaret
hoped
for
a
meeting
with
her
sister
in
this
she
was
disappointed
as
they
came
south
helen
retreated
over
the
brenner
and
wrote
an
unsatisfactory
postcard
from
the
shores
of
the
lake
of
garda
saying
that
her
plans
were
uncertain
and
had
better
be
ignored
evidently
she
disliked
meeting
henry
two
months
are
surely
enough
to
accustom
an
outsider
to
a
situation
which
a
wife
has
accepted
in
two
days
and
margaret
had
again
to
regret
her
sister
lack
of
in
a
long
letter
she
pointed
out
the
need
of
charity
in
sexual
matters
so
little
is
known
about
them
it
is
hard
enough
for
those
who
are
personally
touched
to
judge
then
how
futile
must
be
the
verdict
of
society
i
do
say
there
is
no
standard
for
that
would
destroy
morality
only
that
there
can
be
no
standard
until
our
impulses
are
classified
and
better
understood
helen
thanked
her
for
her
kind
letter
rather
a
curious
reply
she
moved
south
again
and
spoke
of
wintering
in
naples
wilcox
was
not
sorry
that
the
meeting
failed
helen
left
him
time
to
grow
skin
over
his
wound
there
were
still
moments
when
it
pained
him
had
he
only
known
that
margaret
was
awaiting
him
margaret
so
lively
and
intelligent
and
yet
so
submissive
he
would
have
kept
himself
worthier
of
her
incapable
of
grouping
the
past
he
confused
the
episode
of
jacky
with
another
episode
that
had
taken
place
in
the
days
of
his
bachelorhood
the
two
made
one
crop
of
wild
oats
for
which
he
was
heartily
sorry
and
he
could
not
see
that
those
oats
are
of
a
darker
stock
which
are
rooted
in
another
dishonour
unchastity
and
infidelity
were
as
confused
to
him
as
to
the
middle
ages
his
only
moral
teacher
ruth
poor
old
ruth
did
not
enter
into
his
calculations
at
all
for
poor
old
ruth
had
never
found
him
out
his
affection
for
his
present
wife
grew
steadily
her
cleverness
gave
him
no
trouble
and
indeed
he
liked
to
see
her
reading
poetry
or
something
about
social
questions
it
distinguished
her
from
the
wives
of
other
men
he
had
only
to
call
and
she
clapped
the
book
up
and
was
ready
to
do
what
he
wished
then
they
would
argue
so
jollily
and
once
or
twice
she
had
him
in
quite
a
tight
corner
but
as
soon
as
he
grew
really
serious
she
gave
in
man
is
for
war
woman
for
the
recreation
of
the
warrior
but
he
does
not
dislike
it
if
she
makes
a
show
of
fight
she
can
not
win
in
a
real
battle
having
no
muscles
only
nerves
nerves
make
her
jump
out
of
a
moving
or
refuse
to
be
married
fashionably
the
warrior
may
well
allow
her
to
triumph
on
such
occasions
they
move
not
the
imperishable
plinth
of
things
that
touch
his
peace
margaret
had
a
bad
attack
of
these
nerves
during
the
honeymoon
he
told
her
casually
as
was
his
habit
that
oniton
grange
was
let
she
showed
her
annoyance
and
asked
rather
crossly
why
she
had
not
been
consulted
i
did
want
to
bother
you
he
replied
besides
i
have
only
heard
for
certain
this
morning
where
are
we
to
live
said
margaret
trying
to
laugh
i
loved
the
place
extraordinarily
do
you
believe
in
having
a
permanent
home
henry
he
assured
her
that
she
misunderstood
him
it
is
home
life
that
distinguishes
us
from
the
foreigner
but
he
did
not
believe
in
a
damp
home
this
is
news
i
never
heard
till
this
minute
that
oniton
was
damp
my
dear
girl
he
flung
out
his
hand
have
you
eyes
have
you
a
skin
how
could
it
be
anything
but
damp
in
such
a
situation
in
the
first
place
the
grange
is
on
clay
and
built
where
the
castle
moat
must
have
been
then
that
destestable
little
river
steaming
all
night
like
a
kettle
feel
the
cellar
walls
look
up
under
the
eaves
ask
sir
james
or
anyone
those
shropshire
valleys
are
notorious
the
only
possible
place
for
a
house
in
shropshire
is
on
a
hill
but
for
my
part
i
think
the
country
is
too
far
from
london
and
the
scenery
nothing
margaret
could
not
resist
saying
why
did
you
go
there
then
i
because
he
drew
his
head
back
and
grew
rather
angry
why
have
we
come
to
the
tyrol
if
it
comes
to
that
one
might
go
on
asking
such
questions
indefinitely
one
might
but
he
was
only
gaining
time
for
a
plausible
answer
out
it
came
and
he
believed
it
as
soon
as
it
was
spoken
the
truth
is
i
took
oniton
on
account
of
evie
let
this
go
any
further
certainly
not
i
should
like
her
to
know
that
she
nearly
let
me
in
for
a
very
bad
bargain
no
sooner
did
i
sign
the
agreement
than
she
got
engaged
poor
little
girl
she
was
so
keen
on
it
all
and
would
even
wait
to
make
proper
inquiries
about
the
shooting
afraid
it
would
get
snapped
up
just
like
all
of
your
sex
well
no
harm
done
she
has
had
her
country
wedding
and
i
got
rid
of
my
house
to
some
fellows
who
are
starting
a
preparatory
school
where
shall
we
live
then
henry
i
should
enjoy
living
somewhere
i
have
not
yet
decided
what
about
norfolk
margaret
was
silent
marriage
had
not
saved
her
from
the
sense
of
flux
london
was
but
a
foretaste
of
this
nomadic
civilization
which
is
altering
human
nature
so
profoundly
and
throws
upon
personal
relations
a
stress
greater
than
they
have
ever
borne
before
under
cosmopolitanism
if
it
comes
we
shall
receive
no
help
from
the
earth
trees
and
meadows
and
mountains
will
only
be
a
spectacle
and
the
binding
force
that
they
once
exercised
on
character
must
be
entrusted
to
love
alone
may
love
be
equal
to
the
task
it
is
now
what
continued
henry
nearly
october
let
us
camp
for
the
winter
at
ducie
street
and
look
out
for
something
in
the
spring
if
possible
something
permanent
i
ca
be
as
young
as
i
was
for
these
alterations
do
suit
but
my
dear
which
would
you
rather
have
alterations
or
rheumatism
i
see
your
point
said
margaret
getting
up
if
oniton
is
really
damp
it
is
impossible
and
must
be
inhabited
by
little
boys
only
in
the
spring
let
us
look
before
we
leap
i
will
take
warning
by
evie
and
not
hurry
you
remember
that
you
have
a
free
hand
this
time
these
endless
moves
must
be
bad
for
the
furniture
and
are
certainly
expensive
what
a
practical
little
woman
it
is
what
it
been
reading
theo
theo
how
much
theosophy
so
ducie
street
was
her
first
fate
a
pleasant
enough
fate
the
house
being
only
a
little
larger
than
wickham
place
trained
her
for
the
immense
establishment
that
was
promised
in
the
spring
they
were
frequently
away
but
at
home
life
ran
fairly
regularly
in
the
morning
henry
went
to
the
business
and
his
sandwich
a
relic
this
of
some
prehistoric
craving
was
always
cut
by
her
own
hand
he
did
not
rely
upon
the
sandwich
for
lunch
but
liked
to
have
it
by
him
in
case
he
grew
hungry
at
eleven
when
he
had
gone
there
was
the
house
to
look
after
and
the
servants
to
humanize
and
several
kettles
of
helen
to
keep
on
the
boil
her
conscience
pricked
her
a
little
about
the
basts
she
was
not
sorry
to
have
lost
sight
of
them
no
doubt
leonard
was
worth
helping
but
being
henry
wife
she
preferred
to
help
someone
else
as
for
theatres
and
discussion
societies
they
attracted
her
less
and
less
she
began
to
miss
new
movements
and
to
spend
her
spare
time
or
thinking
rather
to
the
concern
of
her
chelsea
friends
they
attributed
the
change
to
her
marriage
and
perhaps
some
deep
instinct
did
warn
her
not
to
travel
further
from
her
husband
than
was
inevitable
yet
the
main
cause
lay
deeper
still
she
had
outgrown
stimulants
and
was
passing
from
words
to
things
it
was
doubtless
a
pity
not
to
keep
up
with
wedekind
or
john
but
some
closing
of
the
gates
is
inevitable
after
thirty
if
the
mind
itself
is
to
become
a
creative
power
chapter
she
was
looking
at
plans
one
day
in
the
following
spring
they
had
finally
decided
to
go
down
into
sussex
and
build
when
charles
wilcox
was
announced
have
you
heard
the
news
dolly
cried
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
charles
is
so
ang
i
mean
he
is
sure
you
know
about
it
or
rather
that
you
do
know
why
dolly
said
margaret
placidly
kissing
her
here
a
surprise
how
are
the
boys
and
the
baby
boys
and
the
baby
were
well
and
in
describing
a
great
row
that
there
had
been
at
hilton
tennis
club
dolly
forgot
her
news
the
wrong
people
had
tried
to
get
in
the
rector
as
representing
the
older
inhabitants
had
said
charles
had
said
the
had
said
charles
had
regretted
not
saying
and
she
closed
the
description
with
but
lucky
you
with
four
courts
of
your
own
at
midhurst
it
will
be
very
jolly
replied
margaret
are
those
the
plans
does
it
matter
me
seeing
them
of
course
not
charles
has
never
seen
the
plans
they
have
only
just
arrived
here
is
the
ground
floor
no
that
rather
difficult
try
the
elevation
we
are
to
have
a
good
many
gables
and
a
picturesque
what
makes
it
smell
so
funny
said
dolly
after
a
moment
inspection
she
was
incapable
of
understanding
plans
or
maps
i
suppose
the
paper
and
which
way
up
is
it
just
the
ordinary
way
up
that
the
and
the
part
that
smells
strongest
is
the
sky
well
ask
me
another
margaret
oh
what
was
i
going
to
say
how
helen
quite
well
is
she
never
coming
back
to
england
every
one
thinks
it
awfully
odd
she
does
so
it
is
said
margaret
trying
to
conceal
her
vexation
she
was
getting
rather
sore
on
this
point
helen
is
odd
awfully
she
has
now
been
away
eight
months
but
has
she
any
address
a
poste
restante
somewhere
in
bavaria
is
her
address
do
write
her
a
line
i
will
look
it
up
for
you
no
do
bother
that
eight
months
she
has
been
away
surely
exactly
she
left
just
after
evie
wedding
it
would
be
eight
months
just
when
baby
was
born
then
just
so
dolly
sighed
and
stared
enviously
round
the
she
was
beginning
to
lose
her
brightness
and
good
looks
the
charles
were
not
well
off
for
wilcox
having
brought
up
his
children
with
expensive
tastes
believed
in
letting
them
shift
for
themselves
after
all
he
had
not
treated
them
generously
yet
another
baby
was
expected
she
told
margaret
and
they
would
have
to
give
up
the
motor
margaret
sympathized
but
in
a
formal
fashion
and
dolly
little
imagined
that
the
was
urging
wilcox
to
make
them
a
more
liberal
allowance
she
sighed
again
and
at
last
the
particular
grievance
was
remembered
oh
yes
she
cried
that
is
it
miss
avery
has
been
unpacking
your
why
has
she
done
that
how
unnecessary
ask
another
i
suppose
you
ordered
her
to
i
gave
no
such
orders
perhaps
she
was
airing
the
things
she
did
undertake
to
light
an
occasional
fire
it
was
far
more
than
an
air
said
dolly
solemnly
the
floor
sounds
covered
with
books
charles
sent
me
to
know
what
is
to
be
done
for
he
feels
certain
you
do
know
books
cried
margaret
moved
by
the
holy
word
dolly
are
you
serious
has
she
been
touching
our
books
has
she
though
what
used
to
be
the
hall
full
of
them
charles
thought
for
certain
you
knew
of
it
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
dolly
what
can
have
come
over
miss
avery
i
must
go
down
about
it
at
once
some
of
the
books
are
my
brother
and
are
quite
valuable
she
had
no
right
to
open
any
of
the
cases
i
say
she
dotty
she
was
the
one
that
never
got
married
you
know
oh
i
say
perhaps
she
thinks
your
books
are
to
herself
old
maids
are
taken
that
way
sometimes
miss
avery
hates
us
all
like
poison
ever
since
her
frightful
with
evie
i
had
heard
of
that
said
margaret
a
visit
from
dolly
had
its
compensations
did
you
know
she
gave
evie
a
present
last
august
and
evie
returned
it
and
then
oh
goloshes
you
never
read
such
a
letter
as
miss
avery
wrote
but
it
was
wrong
of
evie
to
return
it
it
was
like
her
to
do
such
a
heartless
thing
but
the
present
was
so
expensive
why
does
that
make
any
difference
dolly
still
when
it
costs
over
five
pounds
i
did
see
it
but
it
was
a
lovely
enamel
pendant
from
a
bond
street
shop
you
ca
very
well
accept
that
kind
of
thing
from
a
farm
woman
now
can
you
you
accepted
a
present
from
miss
avery
when
you
were
married
oh
mine
was
old
earthenware
stuff
not
worth
a
halfpenny
evie
was
quite
different
you
have
to
ask
anyone
to
the
wedding
who
gave
you
a
pendant
like
that
uncle
percy
and
albert
and
father
and
charles
all
said
it
was
quite
impossible
and
when
four
men
agree
what
is
a
girl
to
do
evie
did
want
to
upset
the
old
thing
so
thought
a
sort
of
joking
letter
best
and
returned
the
pendant
straight
to
the
shop
to
save
miss
avery
trouble
but
miss
avery
said
dolly
eyes
grew
round
it
was
a
perfectly
awful
letter
charles
said
it
was
the
letter
of
a
madman
in
the
end
she
had
the
pendant
back
again
from
the
shop
and
threw
it
into
the
duckpond
did
she
give
any
reasons
we
think
she
meant
to
be
invited
to
oniton
and
so
climb
into
society
she
rather
old
for
that
said
margaret
pensively
may
not
she
have
given
the
present
to
evie
in
remembrance
of
her
mother
that
a
notion
give
every
one
their
due
eh
well
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
toddling
come
along
muff
you
want
a
new
coat
but
i
do
know
who
give
it
you
sure
and
addressing
her
apparel
with
mournful
humour
dolly
moved
from
the
room
margaret
followed
her
to
ask
whether
henry
knew
about
miss
avery
rudeness
oh
yes
i
wonder
then
why
he
let
me
ask
her
to
look
after
the
house
but
she
only
a
farm
woman
said
dolly
and
her
explanation
proved
correct
henry
only
censured
the
lower
classes
when
it
suited
him
he
bore
with
miss
avery
as
with
crane
because
he
could
get
good
value
out
of
them
i
have
patience
with
a
man
who
knows
his
job
he
would
say
really
having
patience
with
the
job
and
not
the
man
paradoxical
as
it
may
sound
he
had
something
of
the
artist
about
him
he
would
pass
over
an
insult
to
his
daughter
sooner
than
lose
a
good
charwoman
for
his
wife
margaret
judged
it
better
to
settle
the
little
trouble
herself
parties
were
evidently
ruffled
with
permission
she
wrote
a
pleasant
note
to
miss
avery
asking
her
to
leave
the
cases
untouched
then
at
the
first
convenient
opportunity
she
went
down
herself
intending
to
repack
her
belongings
and
store
them
properly
in
the
local
warehouse
the
plan
had
been
amateurish
and
a
failure
tibby
promised
to
accompany
her
but
at
the
last
moment
begged
to
be
excused
so
for
the
second
time
in
her
life
she
entered
the
house
alone
chapter
the
day
of
her
visit
was
exquisite
and
the
last
of
unclouded
happiness
that
she
was
to
have
for
many
months
her
anxiety
about
helen
extraordinary
absence
was
still
dormant
and
as
for
a
possible
brush
with
miss
avery
that
only
gave
zest
to
the
expedition
she
had
also
eluded
dolly
invitation
to
luncheon
walking
straight
up
from
the
station
she
crossed
the
village
green
and
entered
the
long
chestnut
avenue
that
connects
it
with
the
church
the
church
itself
stood
in
the
village
once
but
it
there
attracted
so
many
worshippers
that
the
devil
in
a
pet
snatched
it
from
its
foundations
and
poised
it
on
an
inconvenient
knoll
of
a
mile
away
if
this
story
is
true
the
chestnut
avenue
must
have
been
planted
by
the
angels
no
more
tempting
approach
could
be
imagined
for
the
christian
and
if
he
still
finds
the
walk
too
long
the
devil
is
defeated
all
the
same
science
having
built
holy
trinity
a
chapel
of
ease
near
the
charles
and
roofed
it
with
tin
up
the
avenue
margaret
strolled
slowly
stopping
to
watch
the
sky
that
gleamed
through
the
upper
branches
of
the
chestnuts
or
to
finger
the
little
horseshoes
on
the
lower
branches
why
has
not
england
a
great
mythology
our
folklore
has
never
advanced
beyond
daintiness
and
the
greater
melodies
about
our
have
all
issued
through
the
pipes
of
greece
deep
and
true
as
the
native
imagination
can
be
it
seems
to
have
failed
here
it
has
stopped
with
the
witches
and
the
fairies
it
can
not
vivify
one
fraction
of
a
summer
field
or
give
names
to
half
a
dozen
stars
england
still
waits
for
the
supreme
moment
of
her
literature
for
the
great
poet
who
shall
voice
her
or
better
still
for
the
thousand
little
poets
whose
voices
shall
pass
into
our
common
talk
at
the
church
the
scenery
changed
the
chestnut
avenue
opened
into
a
road
smooth
but
narrow
which
led
into
the
untouched
country
she
followed
it
for
over
a
mile
its
little
hesitations
pleased
her
having
no
urgent
destiny
it
strolled
downhill
or
up
as
it
wished
taking
no
trouble
about
the
gradients
nor
about
the
view
which
nevertheless
expanded
the
great
estates
that
throttle
the
south
of
hertfordshire
were
less
obtrusive
here
and
the
appearance
of
the
land
was
neither
aristocratic
nor
suburban
to
define
it
was
difficult
but
margaret
knew
what
it
was
not
it
was
not
snobbish
though
its
contours
were
slight
there
was
a
touch
of
freedom
in
their
sweep
to
which
surrey
will
never
attain
and
the
distant
brow
of
the
chilterns
towered
like
a
mountain
left
to
itself
was
margaret
opinion
this
county
would
vote
liberal
the
comradeship
not
passionate
that
is
our
highest
gift
as
a
nation
was
promised
by
it
as
by
the
low
brick
farm
where
she
called
for
the
key
but
the
inside
of
the
farm
was
disappointing
a
most
finished
young
person
received
her
yes
wilcox
no
wilcox
oh
yes
wilcox
auntie
received
your
letter
quite
duly
auntie
has
gone
up
to
your
little
place
at
the
present
moment
shall
i
send
the
servant
to
direct
you
followed
by
of
course
auntie
does
not
generally
look
after
your
place
she
only
does
it
to
oblige
a
neighbour
as
something
exceptional
it
gives
her
something
to
do
she
spends
quite
a
lot
of
her
time
there
my
husband
says
to
me
sometimes
auntie
i
say
you
ask
she
at
howards
end
yes
wilcox
wilcox
could
i
prevail
upon
you
to
accept
a
piece
of
cake
not
if
i
cut
it
for
you
margaret
refused
the
cake
but
unfortunately
this
acquired
her
gentility
in
the
eyes
of
miss
avery
niece
i
can
not
let
you
go
on
alone
now
do
you
really
must
i
will
direct
you
myself
if
it
comes
to
that
i
must
get
my
hat
now
roguishly
wilcox
do
you
move
while
i
gone
stunned
margaret
did
not
move
from
the
best
parlour
over
which
the
touch
of
art
nouveau
had
fallen
but
the
other
rooms
looked
in
keeping
though
they
conveyed
the
peculiar
sadness
of
a
rural
interior
here
had
lived
an
elder
race
to
which
we
look
back
with
disquietude
the
country
which
we
visit
at
was
really
a
home
to
it
and
the
graver
sides
of
life
the
deaths
the
partings
the
yearnings
for
love
have
their
deepest
expression
in
the
heart
of
the
fields
all
was
not
sadness
the
sun
was
shining
without
the
thrush
sang
his
two
syllables
on
the
budding
some
children
were
playing
uproariously
in
heaps
of
golden
straw
it
was
the
presence
of
sadness
at
all
that
surprised
margaret
and
ended
by
giving
her
a
feeling
of
completeness
in
these
english
farms
if
anywhere
one
might
see
life
steadily
and
see
it
whole
group
in
one
vision
its
transitoriness
and
its
eternal
youth
connect
connect
without
bitterness
until
all
men
are
brothers
but
her
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
the
return
of
miss
avery
niece
and
were
so
tranquillizing
that
she
suffered
the
interruption
gladly
it
was
quicker
to
go
out
by
the
back
door
and
after
due
explanations
they
went
out
by
it
the
niece
was
now
mortified
by
unnumerable
chickens
who
rushed
up
to
her
feet
for
food
and
by
a
shameless
and
maternal
sow
she
did
not
know
what
animals
were
coming
to
but
her
gentility
withered
at
the
touch
of
the
sweet
air
the
wind
was
rising
scattering
the
straw
and
ruffling
the
tails
of
the
ducks
as
they
floated
in
families
over
evie
pendant
one
of
those
delicious
gales
of
spring
in
which
leaves
stiff
in
bud
seem
to
rustle
swept
over
the
land
and
then
fell
silent
georgia
sang
the
thrush
cuckoo
came
furtively
from
the
cliff
of
georgia
pretty
georgia
and
the
other
birds
joined
in
with
nonsense
the
hedge
was
a
picture
which
would
be
finished
in
a
few
days
celandines
grew
on
its
banks
lords
and
ladies
and
primroses
in
the
defended
hollows
the
wild
still
bearing
their
withered
hips
showed
also
the
promise
of
blossom
spring
had
come
clad
in
no
classical
garb
yet
fairer
than
all
springs
fairer
even
than
she
who
walks
through
the
myrtles
of
tuscany
with
the
graces
before
her
and
the
zephyr
behind
the
two
women
walked
up
the
lane
full
of
outward
civility
but
margaret
was
thinking
how
difficult
it
was
to
be
earnest
about
furniture
on
such
a
day
and
the
niece
was
thinking
about
hats
thus
engaged
they
reached
howards
end
petulant
cries
of
auntie
severed
the
air
there
was
no
reply
and
the
front
door
was
locked
are
you
sure
that
miss
avery
is
up
here
asked
margaret
oh
yes
wilcox
quite
sure
she
is
here
daily
margaret
tried
to
look
in
through
the
window
but
the
curtain
inside
was
drawn
tightly
so
with
the
and
the
hall
the
appearance
of
these
curtains
was
familiar
yet
she
did
not
remember
them
being
there
on
her
other
visit
her
impression
was
that
bryce
had
taken
everything
away
they
tried
the
back
here
again
they
received
no
answer
and
could
see
nothing
the
was
fitted
with
a
blind
while
the
pantry
and
scullery
had
pieces
of
wood
propped
up
against
them
which
looked
ominously
like
the
lids
of
margaret
thought
of
her
books
and
she
lifted
up
her
voice
also
at
the
first
cry
she
succeeded
well
well
replied
someone
inside
the
house
if
it
is
wilcox
come
at
last
have
you
got
the
key
auntie
madge
go
away
said
miss
avery
still
invisible
auntie
it
wilcox
margaret
supported
her
your
niece
and
i
have
come
together
madge
go
away
this
is
no
moment
for
your
hat
the
poor
woman
went
red
auntie
gets
more
eccentric
lately
she
said
nervously
miss
avery
called
margaret
i
have
come
about
the
furniture
could
you
kindly
let
me
in
yes
wilcox
said
the
voice
of
course
but
after
that
came
silence
they
called
again
without
response
they
walked
round
the
house
disconsolately
i
hope
miss
avery
is
not
ill
hazarded
margaret
well
if
you
excuse
me
said
madge
perhaps
i
ought
to
be
leaving
you
now
the
servants
need
seeing
to
at
the
farm
auntie
is
so
odd
at
times
gathering
up
her
elegancies
she
retired
defeated
and
as
if
her
departure
had
loosed
a
spring
the
front
door
opened
at
once
miss
avery
said
well
come
right
in
mrs
wilcox
quite
pleasantly
and
calmly
thank
you
so
much
began
margaret
but
broke
off
at
the
sight
of
an
it
was
her
own
come
right
into
the
hall
first
said
miss
avery
she
drew
the
curtain
and
margaret
uttered
a
cry
of
despair
for
an
appalling
thing
had
happened
the
hall
was
fitted
up
with
the
contents
of
the
library
from
wickham
place
the
carpet
had
been
laid
the
big
drawn
up
near
the
window
the
bookcases
filled
the
wall
opposite
the
fireplace
and
her
father
sword
this
is
what
bewildered
her
particularly
had
been
drawn
from
its
scabbard
and
hung
naked
amongst
the
sober
volumes
miss
avery
must
have
worked
for
days
i
afraid
this
is
what
we
meant
she
began
wilcox
and
i
never
intended
the
cases
to
be
touched
for
instance
these
books
are
my
brother
we
are
storing
them
for
him
and
for
my
sister
who
is
abroad
when
you
kindly
undertook
to
look
after
things
we
never
expected
you
to
do
so
much
the
house
has
been
empty
long
enough
said
the
old
woman
margaret
refused
to
argue
i
dare
say
we
explain
she
said
civilly
it
has
been
a
mistake
and
very
likely
our
mistake
wilcox
it
has
been
mistake
upon
mistake
for
fifty
years
the
house
is
wilcox
and
she
would
not
desire
it
to
stand
empty
any
longer
to
help
the
poor
decaying
brain
margaret
said
yes
wilcox
house
the
mother
of
mr
charles
mistake
upon
mistake
said
miss
avery
mistake
upon
mistake
well
i
do
know
said
margaret
sitting
down
in
one
of
her
own
chairs
i
really
do
know
what
to
be
done
she
could
not
help
laughing
the
other
said
yes
it
should
be
a
merry
house
enough
i
do
know
i
dare
say
well
thank
you
very
much
miss
avery
yes
that
all
right
delightful
there
is
still
the
parlour
she
went
through
the
door
opposite
and
drew
a
curtain
light
flooded
the
and
the
furniture
from
wickham
place
and
the
more
curtains
were
drawn
more
windows
were
flung
open
to
the
spring
then
through
here
miss
avery
continued
passing
and
repassing
through
the
hall
her
voice
was
lost
but
margaret
heard
her
pulling
up
the
kitchen
blind
i
not
finished
here
yet
she
announced
returning
there
still
a
deal
to
do
the
farm
lads
will
carry
your
great
wardrobes
upstairs
for
there
is
no
need
to
go
into
expense
at
hilton
it
is
all
a
mistake
repeated
margaret
feeling
that
she
must
put
her
foot
down
a
misunderstanding
wilcox
and
i
are
not
going
to
live
at
howards
end
oh
indeed
on
account
of
his
hay
fever
we
have
settled
to
build
a
new
home
for
ourselves
in
sussex
and
part
of
this
furniture
my
part
will
go
down
there
presently
she
looked
at
miss
avery
intently
trying
to
understand
the
kink
in
her
brain
here
was
no
maundering
old
woman
her
wrinkles
were
shrewd
and
humorous
she
looked
capable
of
scathing
wit
and
also
of
high
but
unostentatious
nobility
you
think
that
you
wo
come
back
to
live
here
wilcox
but
you
will
that
remains
to
be
seen
said
margaret
smiling
we
have
no
intention
of
doing
so
for
the
present
we
happen
to
need
a
much
larger
house
circumstances
oblige
us
to
give
big
parties
of
course
some
day
one
never
knows
does
one
miss
avery
retorted
some
day
tcha
tcha
talk
about
some
day
you
are
living
here
now
am
i
you
are
living
here
and
have
been
for
the
last
ten
minutes
if
you
ask
me
it
was
a
senseless
remark
but
with
a
queer
feeling
of
disloyalty
margaret
rose
from
her
chair
she
felt
that
henry
had
been
obscurely
censured
they
went
into
the
where
the
sunlight
poured
in
upon
her
chiffonier
and
upstairs
where
many
an
old
god
peeped
from
a
new
niche
the
furniture
fitted
extraordinarily
well
in
the
central
room
over
the
hall
the
room
that
helen
had
slept
in
four
years
ago
miss
avery
had
placed
tibby
old
bassinette
the
nursery
she
said
margaret
turned
away
without
speaking
at
last
everything
was
seen
the
kitchen
and
lobby
were
still
stacked
with
furniture
and
straw
but
as
far
as
she
could
make
out
nothing
had
been
broken
or
scratched
a
pathetic
display
of
ingenuity
then
they
took
a
friendly
stroll
in
the
garden
it
had
gone
wild
since
her
last
visit
the
gravel
sweep
was
weedy
and
grass
had
sprung
up
at
the
very
jaws
of
the
garage
and
evie
rockery
was
only
bumps
perhaps
evie
was
responsible
for
miss
oddness
but
margaret
suspected
that
the
cause
lay
deeper
and
that
the
girl
silly
letter
had
but
loosed
the
irritation
of
years
it
a
beautiful
meadow
she
remarked
it
was
one
of
those
that
have
been
formed
hundreds
of
years
ago
out
of
the
smaller
fields
so
the
boundary
hedge
zigzagged
down
the
hill
at
right
angles
and
at
the
bottom
there
was
a
little
green
annex
a
sort
of
for
the
cows
yes
the
maidy
well
enough
said
miss
avery
for
those
that
is
who
do
suffer
from
sneezing
and
she
cackled
maliciously
i
seen
charlie
wilcox
go
out
to
my
lads
in
hay
time
oh
they
ought
to
do
this
they
must
do
that
he
learn
them
to
be
lads
and
just
then
the
tickling
took
him
he
has
it
from
his
father
with
other
things
there
not
one
wilcox
that
can
stand
up
against
a
field
in
june
i
laughed
fit
to
burst
while
he
was
courting
ruth
my
brother
gets
hay
fever
too
said
margaret
this
house
lies
too
much
on
the
land
for
them
naturally
they
were
glad
enough
to
slip
in
at
first
but
wilcoxes
are
better
than
nothing
as
i
see
you
found
margaret
laughed
they
keep
a
place
going
do
they
yes
it
is
just
that
they
keep
england
going
it
is
my
opinion
but
miss
avery
upset
her
by
replying
ay
they
breed
like
rabbits
well
well
it
a
funny
world
but
he
who
made
it
knows
what
he
wants
in
it
i
suppose
if
charlie
is
expecting
her
fourth
it
is
for
us
to
repine
they
breed
and
they
also
work
said
margaret
conscious
of
some
invitation
to
disloyalty
which
was
echoed
by
the
very
breeze
and
by
the
songs
of
the
birds
it
certainly
is
a
funny
world
but
so
long
as
men
like
my
husband
and
his
sons
govern
it
i
think
it
never
be
a
bad
one
never
really
bad
no
nothing
said
miss
avery
and
turned
to
the
on
their
way
back
to
the
farm
she
spoke
of
her
old
friend
much
more
clearly
than
before
in
the
house
margaret
had
wondered
whether
she
quite
distinguished
the
first
wife
from
the
second
now
she
said
i
never
saw
much
of
ruth
after
her
grandmother
died
but
we
stayed
civil
it
was
a
very
civil
family
old
howard
never
spoke
against
anybody
nor
let
anyone
be
turned
away
without
food
then
it
was
never
will
be
prosecuted
in
their
land
but
would
people
please
not
come
in
howard
was
never
created
to
run
a
farm
had
they
no
men
to
help
them
margaret
asked
miss
avery
replied
things
went
on
until
there
were
no
men
until
wilcox
came
along
corrected
margaret
anxious
that
her
husband
should
receive
his
dues
i
suppose
so
but
ruth
should
have
married
a
no
disrespect
to
you
to
say
this
for
i
take
it
you
were
intended
to
get
wilcox
any
way
whether
she
got
him
first
or
no
whom
should
she
have
married
a
soldier
exclaimed
the
old
woman
some
real
soldier
margaret
was
silent
it
was
a
criticism
of
character
far
more
trenchant
than
any
of
her
own
she
felt
dissatisfied
but
that
all
over
she
went
on
a
better
time
is
coming
now
though
you
kept
me
long
enough
waiting
in
a
couple
of
weeks
i
see
your
lights
shining
through
the
hedge
of
an
evening
have
you
ordered
in
coals
we
are
not
coming
said
margaret
firmly
she
respected
miss
avery
too
much
to
humour
her
no
not
coming
never
coming
it
has
all
been
a
mistake
the
furniture
must
be
repacked
at
once
and
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
am
making
other
arrangements
and
must
ask
you
to
give
me
the
keys
certainly
wilcox
said
miss
avery
and
resigned
her
duties
with
a
smile
relieved
at
this
conclusion
and
having
sent
her
compliments
to
madge
margaret
walked
back
to
the
station
she
had
intended
to
go
to
the
furniture
warehouse
and
give
directions
for
removal
but
the
muddle
had
turned
out
more
extensive
than
she
expected
so
she
decided
to
consult
henry
it
was
as
well
that
she
did
this
he
was
strongly
against
employing
the
local
man
whom
he
had
previously
recommended
and
advised
her
to
store
in
london
after
all
but
before
this
could
be
done
an
unexpected
trouble
fell
upon
her
chapter
it
was
not
unexpected
entirely
aunt
juley
health
had
been
bad
all
the
winter
she
had
had
a
long
series
of
colds
and
coughs
and
had
been
too
busy
to
get
rid
of
them
she
had
scarcely
promised
her
niece
to
really
take
my
tiresome
chest
in
hand
when
she
caught
a
chill
and
developed
acute
pneumonia
margaret
and
tibby
went
down
to
swanage
helen
was
telegraphed
for
and
that
spring
party
that
after
all
gathered
in
that
hospitable
house
had
all
the
pathos
of
fair
memories
on
a
perfect
day
when
the
sky
seemed
blue
porcelain
and
the
waves
of
the
discreet
little
bay
beat
gentlest
of
tattoos
upon
the
sand
margaret
hurried
up
through
the
rhododendrons
confronted
again
by
the
senselessness
of
death
one
death
may
explain
itself
but
it
throws
no
light
upon
another
the
groping
inquiry
must
begin
anew
preachers
or
scientists
may
generalize
but
we
know
that
no
generality
is
possible
about
those
whom
we
love
not
one
heaven
awaits
them
not
even
one
oblivion
aunt
juley
incapable
of
tragedy
slipped
out
of
life
with
odd
little
laughs
and
apologies
for
having
stopped
in
it
so
long
she
was
very
weak
she
could
not
rise
to
the
occasion
or
realize
the
great
mystery
which
all
agree
must
await
her
it
only
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
quite
done
up
more
done
up
than
ever
before
that
she
saw
and
heard
and
felt
less
every
moment
and
that
unless
something
changed
she
would
soon
feel
nothing
her
spare
strength
she
devoted
to
plans
could
not
margaret
take
some
steamer
expeditions
were
mackerel
cooked
as
tibby
liked
them
she
worried
herself
about
helen
absence
and
also
that
she
could
be
the
cause
of
helen
return
the
nurses
seemed
to
think
such
interests
quite
natural
and
perhaps
hers
was
an
average
approach
to
the
great
gate
but
margaret
saw
death
stripped
of
any
false
romance
whatever
the
idea
of
death
may
contain
the
process
can
be
trivial
and
hideous
important
margaret
dear
take
the
lulworth
when
helen
comes
helen
wo
be
able
to
stop
aunt
juley
she
has
telegraphed
that
she
can
only
get
away
just
to
see
you
she
must
go
back
to
germany
as
soon
as
you
are
well
how
very
odd
of
helen
wilcox
yes
dear
can
he
spare
you
henry
wished
her
to
come
and
had
been
very
kind
yet
again
margaret
said
so
munt
did
not
die
quite
outside
her
will
a
more
dignified
power
took
hold
of
her
and
checked
her
on
the
downward
slope
she
returned
without
emotion
as
fidgety
as
ever
on
the
fourth
day
she
was
out
of
danger
margaret
important
it
went
on
i
should
like
you
to
have
some
companion
to
take
walks
with
do
try
miss
conder
i
have
been
a
little
walk
with
miss
conder
but
she
is
not
really
interesting
if
only
you
had
helen
i
have
tibby
aunt
juley
no
but
he
has
to
do
his
chinese
some
real
companion
is
what
you
need
really
helen
is
odd
helen
is
odd
very
agreed
margaret
not
content
with
going
abroad
why
does
she
want
to
go
back
there
at
once
no
doubt
she
will
change
her
mind
when
she
sees
us
she
has
not
the
least
balance
that
was
the
stock
criticism
about
helen
but
voice
trembled
as
she
made
it
by
now
she
was
deeply
pained
at
her
sister
behaviour
it
may
be
unbalanced
to
fly
out
of
england
but
to
stop
away
eight
months
argues
that
the
heart
is
awry
as
well
as
the
head
a
could
recall
helen
but
she
was
deaf
to
more
human
calls
after
a
glimpse
at
her
aunt
she
would
retire
into
her
nebulous
life
behind
some
poste
restante
she
scarcely
existed
her
letters
had
become
dull
and
infrequent
she
had
no
wants
and
no
curiosity
and
it
was
all
put
down
to
poor
account
henry
long
pardoned
by
his
wife
was
still
too
infamous
to
be
greeted
by
his
it
was
morbid
and
to
her
alarm
margaret
fancied
that
she
could
trace
the
growth
of
morbidity
back
in
helen
life
for
nearly
four
years
the
flight
from
oniton
the
unbalanced
patronage
of
the
basts
the
explosion
of
grief
up
on
the
downs
all
connected
with
paul
an
insignificant
boy
whose
lips
had
kissed
hers
for
a
fraction
of
time
margaret
and
wilcox
had
feared
that
they
might
kiss
again
foolishly
the
real
danger
was
reaction
reaction
against
the
wilcoxes
had
eaten
into
her
life
until
she
was
scarcely
sane
at
she
had
an
idee
fixe
what
hope
was
there
for
her
as
an
old
woman
the
more
margaret
thought
about
it
the
more
alarmed
she
became
for
many
months
she
had
put
the
subject
away
but
it
was
too
big
to
be
slighted
now
there
was
almost
a
taint
of
madness
were
all
helen
actions
to
be
governed
by
a
tiny
mishap
such
as
may
happen
to
any
young
man
or
woman
can
human
nature
be
constructed
on
lines
so
insignificant
the
blundering
little
encounter
at
howards
end
was
vital
it
propagated
itself
where
graver
intercourse
lay
barren
it
was
stronger
than
sisterly
intimacy
stronger
than
reason
or
books
in
one
of
her
moods
helen
had
confessed
that
she
still
enjoyed
it
in
a
certain
sense
paul
had
faded
but
the
magic
of
his
caress
endured
and
where
there
is
enjoyment
of
the
past
there
may
also
be
reaction
propagation
at
both
ends
well
it
is
odd
and
sad
that
our
minds
should
be
such
and
we
without
power
to
choose
the
seed
but
man
is
an
odd
sad
creature
as
yet
intent
on
pilfering
the
earth
and
heedless
of
the
growths
within
himself
he
can
not
be
bored
about
psychology
he
leaves
it
to
the
specialist
which
is
as
if
he
should
leave
his
dinner
to
be
eaten
by
a
he
can
not
be
bothered
to
digest
his
own
soul
margaret
and
helen
have
been
more
patient
and
it
is
suggested
that
margaret
has
succeeded
so
far
as
success
is
yet
possible
she
does
understand
herself
she
has
some
rudimentary
control
over
her
own
growth
whether
helen
has
succeeded
one
can
not
say
the
day
that
munt
rallied
helen
letter
arrived
she
had
posted
it
at
munich
and
would
be
in
london
herself
on
the
morrow
it
was
a
disquieting
letter
though
the
opening
was
affectionate
and
sane
dearest
meg
give
helen
love
to
aunt
juley
tell
her
that
i
love
and
have
loved
her
ever
since
i
can
remember
i
shall
be
in
london
thursday
my
address
will
be
care
of
the
bankers
i
have
not
yet
settled
on
a
hotel
so
write
or
wire
to
me
there
and
give
me
detailed
news
if
aunt
juley
is
much
better
or
if
for
a
terrible
reason
it
would
be
no
good
my
coming
down
to
swanage
you
must
not
think
it
odd
if
i
do
not
come
i
have
all
sorts
of
plans
in
my
head
i
am
living
abroad
at
present
and
want
to
get
back
as
quickly
as
possible
will
you
please
tell
me
where
our
furniture
is
i
should
like
to
take
out
one
or
two
books
the
rest
are
for
you
forgive
me
dearest
meg
this
must
read
like
rather
a
tiresome
letter
but
all
letters
are
from
your
loving
helen
it
was
a
tiresome
letter
for
it
tempted
margaret
to
tell
a
lie
if
she
wrote
that
aunt
juley
was
still
in
danger
her
sister
would
come
unhealthiness
is
contagious
we
can
not
be
in
contact
with
those
who
are
in
a
morbid
state
without
ourselves
deteriorating
to
act
for
the
best
might
do
helen
good
but
would
do
herself
harm
and
at
the
risk
of
disaster
she
kept
her
colours
flying
a
little
longer
she
replied
that
their
aunt
was
much
better
and
awaited
developments
tibby
approved
of
her
reply
mellowing
rapidly
he
was
a
pleasanter
companion
than
before
oxford
had
done
much
for
him
he
had
lost
his
peevishness
and
could
hide
his
indifference
to
people
and
his
interest
in
food
but
he
had
not
grown
more
human
the
years
between
eighteen
and
so
magical
for
most
were
leading
him
gently
from
boyhood
to
middle
age
he
had
never
known
that
quality
which
warms
the
heart
till
death
and
gives
wilcox
an
imperishable
charm
he
was
frigid
through
no
fault
of
his
own
and
without
cruelty
he
thought
helen
wrong
and
margaret
right
but
the
family
trouble
was
for
him
what
a
scene
behind
footlights
is
for
most
people
he
had
only
one
suggestion
to
make
and
that
was
characteristic
why
do
you
tell
mr
wilcox
about
helen
perhaps
he
has
come
across
that
sort
of
thing
he
would
do
all
he
could
but
oh
you
know
best
but
he
is
practical
it
was
the
student
belief
in
experts
margaret
demurred
for
one
or
two
reasons
presently
helen
answer
came
she
sent
a
telegram
requesting
the
address
of
the
furniture
as
she
would
now
return
at
once
margaret
replied
certainly
not
meet
me
at
the
bankers
at
four
she
and
tibby
went
up
to
london
helen
was
not
at
the
bankers
and
they
were
refused
her
address
helen
had
passed
into
chaos
margaret
put
her
arm
round
her
brother
he
was
all
that
she
had
left
and
never
had
he
seemed
more
unsubstantial
tibby
love
what
next
he
replied
it
is
extraordinary
dear
your
judgment
often
clearer
than
mine
have
you
any
notion
what
at
the
back
none
unless
it
something
mental
oh
that
said
margaret
quite
impossible
but
the
suggestion
had
been
uttered
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
took
it
up
herself
nothing
else
explained
and
london
agreed
with
tibby
the
mask
fell
off
the
city
and
she
saw
it
for
what
it
really
is
a
caricature
of
infinity
the
familiar
barriers
the
streets
along
which
she
moved
the
houses
between
which
she
had
made
her
little
journeys
for
so
many
years
became
negligible
suddenly
helen
seemed
one
with
grimy
trees
and
the
traffic
and
the
slabs
of
mud
she
had
accomplished
a
hideous
act
of
renunciation
and
returned
to
the
one
margaret
own
faith
held
firm
she
knew
the
human
soul
will
be
merged
if
it
be
merged
at
all
with
the
stars
and
the
sea
yet
she
felt
that
her
sister
had
been
going
amiss
for
many
years
it
was
symbolic
the
catastrophe
should
come
now
on
a
london
afternoon
while
rain
fell
slowly
henry
was
the
only
hope
henry
was
definite
he
might
know
of
some
paths
in
the
chaos
that
were
hidden
from
them
and
she
determined
to
take
tibby
advice
and
lay
the
whole
matter
in
his
hands
they
must
call
at
his
office
he
could
not
well
make
it
worse
she
went
for
a
few
moments
into
paul
whose
dome
stands
out
of
the
welter
so
bravely
as
if
preaching
the
gospel
of
form
but
within
paul
is
as
its
surroundings
echoes
and
whispers
inaudible
songs
invisible
mosaics
wet
footmarks
crossing
and
recrossing
the
floor
si
monumentum
requiris
circumspice
it
points
us
back
to
london
there
was
no
hope
of
helen
here
henry
was
unsatisfactory
at
first
that
she
had
expected
he
was
overjoyed
to
see
her
back
from
swanage
and
slow
to
admit
the
growth
of
a
new
trouble
when
they
told
him
of
their
search
he
only
chaffed
tibby
and
the
schlegels
generally
and
declared
that
it
was
just
like
helen
to
lead
her
relatives
a
dance
that
is
what
we
all
say
replied
margaret
but
why
should
it
be
just
like
helen
why
should
she
be
allowed
to
be
so
queer
and
to
grow
queerer
do
ask
me
i
a
plain
man
of
business
i
live
and
let
live
my
advice
to
you
both
is
do
worry
margaret
you
got
black
marks
again
under
your
eyes
you
know
that
strictly
forbidden
first
your
aunt
then
your
sister
no
we
are
going
to
have
it
are
we
theobald
he
rang
the
bell
i
give
you
some
tea
and
then
you
go
straight
to
ducie
street
i
ca
have
my
girl
looking
as
old
as
her
husband
all
the
same
you
have
not
quite
seen
our
point
said
tibby
wilcox
who
was
in
good
spirits
retorted
i
suppose
i
ever
shall
he
leant
back
laughing
at
the
gifted
but
ridiculous
family
while
the
fire
flickered
over
the
map
of
africa
margaret
motioned
to
her
brother
to
go
on
rather
diffident
he
obeyed
her
margaret
point
is
this
he
said
our
sister
may
be
mad
charles
who
was
working
in
the
inner
room
looked
round
come
in
charles
said
margaret
kindly
could
you
help
us
at
all
we
are
again
in
trouble
i
afraid
i
can
not
what
are
the
facts
we
are
all
mad
more
or
less
you
know
in
these
days
the
facts
are
as
follows
replied
tibby
who
had
at
times
a
pedantic
lucidity
the
facts
are
that
she
has
been
in
england
for
three
days
and
will
not
see
us
she
has
forbidden
the
bankers
to
give
us
her
address
she
refuses
to
answer
questions
margaret
finds
her
letters
colourless
there
are
other
facts
but
these
are
the
most
striking
she
has
never
behaved
like
this
before
then
asked
henry
of
course
not
said
his
wife
with
a
frown
well
my
dear
how
am
i
to
know
a
senseless
spasm
of
annoyance
came
over
her
you
know
quite
well
that
helen
never
sins
against
affection
she
said
you
must
have
noticed
that
much
in
her
surely
oh
yes
she
and
i
have
always
hit
it
off
together
no
henry
ca
you
see
i
do
mean
that
she
recovered
herself
but
not
before
charles
had
observed
her
stupid
and
attentive
he
was
watching
the
scene
i
was
meaning
that
when
she
was
eccentric
in
the
past
one
could
trace
it
back
to
the
heart
in
the
long
run
she
behaved
oddly
because
she
cared
for
someone
or
wanted
to
help
them
there
no
possible
excuse
for
her
now
she
is
grieving
us
deeply
and
that
is
why
i
am
sure
that
she
is
not
well
is
too
terrible
a
word
but
she
is
not
well
i
shall
never
believe
it
i
should
discuss
my
sister
with
you
if
i
thought
she
was
well
trouble
you
about
her
i
mean
henry
began
to
grow
serious
was
to
him
something
perfectly
definite
generally
well
himself
he
could
not
realize
that
we
sink
to
it
by
slow
gradations
the
sick
had
no
rights
they
were
outside
the
pale
one
could
lie
to
them
remorselessly
when
his
first
wife
was
seized
he
had
promised
to
take
her
down
into
hertfordshire
but
meanwhile
arranged
with
a
instead
helen
too
was
and
the
plan
that
he
sketched
out
for
her
capture
clever
and
as
it
was
drew
its
ethics
from
the
you
want
to
get
hold
of
her
he
said
that
the
problem
is
it
she
has
got
to
see
a
doctor
for
all
i
know
she
has
seen
one
already
yes
yes
do
interrupt
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
thought
intently
the
genial
tentative
host
disappeared
and
they
saw
instead
the
man
who
had
carved
money
out
of
greece
and
africa
and
bought
forests
from
the
natives
for
a
few
bottles
of
gin
i
got
it
he
said
at
last
perfectly
easy
leave
it
to
me
we
send
her
down
to
howards
end
how
will
you
do
that
after
her
books
tell
her
that
she
must
unpack
them
herself
then
you
can
meet
her
there
but
henry
that
just
what
she
wo
let
me
do
part
of
her
whatever
it
is
never
to
see
me
of
course
you
wo
tell
her
you
going
when
she
is
there
looking
at
the
cases
you
just
stroll
in
if
nothing
is
wrong
with
her
so
much
the
better
but
be
the
motor
round
the
corner
and
we
can
run
her
up
to
a
specialist
in
no
time
margaret
shook
her
head
it
quite
impossible
why
it
does
seem
impossible
to
me
said
tibby
it
is
surely
a
very
tippy
plan
it
is
impossible
because
she
looked
at
her
husband
sadly
it
not
the
particular
language
that
helen
and
i
talk
if
you
see
my
meaning
it
would
do
splendidly
for
other
people
whom
i
do
blame
but
helen
does
talk
said
tibby
that
our
whole
difficulty
she
wo
talk
your
particular
language
and
on
that
account
you
think
she
no
henry
it
sweet
of
you
but
i
could
i
see
he
said
you
have
scruples
i
suppose
so
and
sooner
than
go
against
them
you
would
have
your
sister
suffer
you
could
have
got
her
down
to
swanage
by
a
word
but
you
had
scruples
and
scruples
are
all
very
well
i
am
as
scrupulous
as
any
man
alive
i
hope
but
when
it
is
a
case
like
this
when
there
is
a
question
of
madness
i
deny
it
madness
you
said
just
now
it
madness
when
i
say
it
but
not
when
you
say
it
henry
shrugged
his
shoulders
margaret
margaret
he
groaned
no
education
can
teach
a
woman
logic
now
my
dear
my
time
is
valuable
do
you
want
me
to
help
you
or
not
not
in
that
way
answer
my
question
plain
question
plain
answer
do
charles
surprised
them
by
interrupting
pater
we
may
as
well
keep
howards
end
out
of
it
he
said
why
charles
charles
could
give
no
reason
but
margaret
felt
as
if
over
tremendous
distance
a
salutation
had
passed
between
them
the
whole
house
is
at
sixes
and
sevens
he
said
crossly
we
do
want
any
more
mess
who
asked
his
father
my
boy
pray
who
i
am
sure
i
beg
your
pardon
said
charles
i
appear
always
to
be
intruding
by
now
margaret
wished
she
had
never
mentioned
her
trouble
to
her
husband
retreat
was
impossible
he
was
determined
to
push
the
matter
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
and
helen
faded
as
he
talked
her
fair
flying
hair
and
eager
eyes
counted
for
nothing
for
she
was
ill
without
rights
and
any
of
her
friends
might
hunt
her
sick
at
heart
margaret
joined
in
the
chase
she
wrote
her
sister
a
lying
letter
at
her
husband
dictation
she
said
the
furniture
was
all
at
howards
end
but
could
be
seen
on
monday
next
at
when
a
charwoman
would
be
in
attendance
it
was
a
cold
letter
and
the
more
plausible
for
that
helen
would
think
she
was
offended
and
on
monday
next
she
and
henry
were
to
lunch
with
dolly
and
then
ambush
themselves
in
the
garden
after
they
had
gone
wilcox
said
to
his
son
i
ca
have
this
sort
of
behaviour
my
boy
margaret
too
to
mind
but
i
mind
for
her
charles
made
no
answer
is
anything
wrong
with
you
charles
this
afternoon
no
pater
but
you
may
be
taking
on
a
bigger
business
than
you
reckon
how
do
ask
me
chapter
one
speaks
of
the
moods
of
spring
but
the
days
that
are
her
true
children
have
only
one
mood
they
are
all
full
of
the
rising
and
dropping
of
winds
and
the
whistling
of
birds
new
flowers
may
come
out
the
green
embroidery
of
the
hedges
increase
but
the
same
heaven
broods
overhead
soft
thick
and
blue
the
same
figures
seen
and
unseen
are
wandering
by
coppice
and
meadow
the
morning
that
margaret
had
spent
with
miss
avery
and
the
afternoon
she
set
out
to
entrap
helen
were
the
scales
of
a
single
balance
time
might
never
have
moved
rain
never
have
fallen
and
man
alone
with
his
schemes
and
ailments
was
troubling
nature
until
he
saw
her
through
a
veil
of
tears
she
protested
no
more
whether
henry
was
right
or
wrong
he
was
most
kind
and
she
knew
of
no
other
standard
by
which
to
judge
him
she
must
trust
him
absolutely
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
up
a
business
his
obtuseness
vanished
he
profited
by
the
slightest
indications
and
the
capture
of
helen
promised
to
be
staged
as
deftly
as
the
marriage
of
evie
they
went
down
in
the
morning
as
arranged
and
he
discovered
that
their
victim
was
actually
in
hilton
on
his
arrival
he
called
at
all
the
in
the
village
and
had
a
few
minutes
serious
conversation
with
the
proprietors
what
he
said
margaret
did
not
know
perhaps
not
the
truth
but
news
arrived
after
lunch
that
a
lady
had
come
by
the
london
train
and
had
taken
a
fly
to
howards
end
she
was
bound
to
drive
said
henry
there
will
be
her
books
i
can
not
make
it
out
said
margaret
for
the
hundredth
time
finish
your
coffee
dear
we
must
be
off
yes
margaret
you
know
you
must
take
plenty
said
dolly
margaret
tried
but
suddenly
lifted
her
hand
to
her
eyes
dolly
stole
glances
at
her
which
he
did
not
answer
in
the
silence
the
motor
came
round
to
the
door
you
not
fit
for
it
he
said
anxiously
let
me
go
alone
i
know
exactly
what
to
do
oh
yes
i
am
fit
said
margaret
uncovering
her
face
only
most
frightfully
worried
i
can
not
feel
that
helen
is
really
alive
her
letters
and
telegrams
seem
to
have
come
from
someone
else
her
voice
is
in
them
i
believe
your
driver
really
saw
her
at
the
station
i
wish
i
never
mentioned
it
i
know
that
charles
is
vexed
yes
he
is
she
seized
dolly
hand
and
kissed
it
there
dolly
will
forgive
me
there
now
we
be
off
henry
had
been
looking
at
her
closely
he
did
not
like
this
breakdown
do
you
want
to
tidy
yourself
he
asked
have
i
time
yes
plenty
she
went
to
the
lavatory
by
the
front
door
and
as
soon
as
the
bolt
slipped
wilcox
said
quietly
dolly
i
going
without
her
dolly
eyes
lit
up
with
vulgar
excitement
she
followed
him
on
out
to
the
car
tell
her
i
thought
it
best
yes
wilcox
i
see
say
anything
you
like
all
right
the
car
started
well
and
with
ordinary
luck
would
have
got
away
but
who
was
playing
in
the
garden
chose
this
moment
to
sit
down
in
the
middle
of
the
path
crane
in
trying
to
pass
him
ran
one
wheel
over
a
bed
of
wallflowers
dolly
screamed
margaret
hearing
the
noise
rushed
out
hatless
and
was
in
time
to
jump
on
the
footboard
she
said
not
a
single
word
he
was
only
treating
her
as
she
had
treated
helen
and
her
rage
at
his
dishonesty
only
helped
to
indicate
what
helen
would
feel
against
them
she
thought
i
deserve
it
i
am
punished
for
lowering
my
colours
and
she
accepted
his
apologies
with
a
calmness
that
astonished
him
i
still
consider
you
are
not
fit
for
it
he
kept
saying
perhaps
i
was
not
at
lunch
but
the
whole
thing
is
spread
clearly
before
me
now
i
was
meaning
to
act
for
the
best
just
lend
me
your
scarf
will
you
this
wind
takes
one
hair
so
certainly
dear
girl
are
you
all
right
now
look
my
hands
have
stopped
trembling
and
have
quite
forgiven
me
then
listen
her
cab
should
already
have
arrived
at
howards
end
we
a
little
late
but
no
matter
our
first
move
will
be
to
send
it
down
to
wait
at
the
farm
as
if
possible
one
does
want
a
scene
before
servants
a
certain
gentleman
he
pointed
at
crane
back
wo
drive
in
but
will
wait
a
little
short
of
the
front
gate
behind
the
laurels
have
you
still
the
keys
of
the
house
yes
well
they
are
wanted
do
you
remember
how
the
house
stands
yes
if
we
do
find
her
in
the
porch
we
can
stroll
round
into
the
garden
our
object
here
they
stopped
to
pick
up
the
doctor
i
was
just
saying
to
my
wife
mansbridge
that
our
main
object
is
not
to
frighten
miss
schlegel
the
house
as
you
know
is
my
property
so
it
should
seem
quite
natural
for
us
to
be
there
the
trouble
is
evidently
nervous
would
you
say
so
margaret
the
doctor
a
very
young
man
began
to
ask
questions
about
helen
was
she
normal
was
there
anything
congenital
or
hereditary
had
anything
occurred
that
was
likely
to
alienate
her
from
her
family
nothing
answered
margaret
wondering
what
would
have
happened
if
she
had
added
though
she
did
resent
my
husband
immorality
she
always
was
highly
strung
pursued
henry
leaning
back
in
the
car
as
it
shot
past
the
church
a
tendency
to
spiritualism
and
those
things
though
nothing
serious
musical
literary
artistic
but
i
should
say
normal
a
very
charming
girl
margaret
anger
and
terror
increased
every
moment
how
dare
these
men
label
her
sister
what
horrors
lay
ahead
what
impertinences
that
shelter
under
the
name
of
science
the
pack
was
turning
on
helen
to
deny
her
human
rights
and
it
seemed
to
margaret
that
all
schlegels
were
threatened
with
her
were
they
normal
what
a
question
to
ask
and
it
is
always
those
who
know
nothing
about
human
nature
who
are
bored
by
psychology
and
shocked
by
physiology
who
ask
it
however
piteous
her
sister
state
she
knew
that
she
must
be
on
her
side
they
would
be
mad
together
if
the
world
chose
to
consider
them
so
it
was
now
five
minutes
past
three
the
car
slowed
down
by
the
farm
in
the
yard
of
which
miss
avery
was
standing
henry
asked
her
whether
a
cab
had
gone
past
she
nodded
and
the
next
moment
they
caught
sight
of
it
at
the
end
of
the
lane
the
car
ran
silently
like
a
beast
of
prey
so
unsuspicious
was
helen
that
she
was
sitting
on
the
porch
with
her
back
to
the
road
she
had
come
only
her
head
and
shoulders
were
visible
she
sat
framed
in
the
vine
and
one
of
her
hands
played
with
the
buds
the
wind
ruffled
her
hair
the
sun
glorified
it
she
was
as
she
had
always
been
margaret
was
seated
next
to
the
door
before
her
husband
could
prevent
her
she
slipped
out
she
ran
to
the
garden
gate
which
was
shut
passed
through
it
and
deliberately
pushed
it
in
his
face
the
noise
alarmed
helen
margaret
saw
her
rise
with
an
unfamiliar
movement
and
rushing
into
the
porch
learnt
the
simple
explanation
of
all
their
fears
her
sister
was
with
child
is
the
truant
all
right
called
henry
she
had
time
to
whisper
oh
my
darling
the
keys
of
the
house
were
in
her
hand
she
unlocked
howards
end
and
thrust
helen
into
it
yes
all
right
she
said
and
stood
with
her
back
to
the
door
chapter
margaret
you
look
upset
said
henry
mansbridge
had
followed
crane
was
at
the
gate
and
the
flyman
had
stood
up
on
the
box
margaret
shook
her
head
at
them
she
could
not
speak
any
more
she
remained
clutching
the
keys
as
if
all
their
future
depended
on
them
henry
was
asking
more
questions
she
shook
her
head
again
his
words
had
no
sense
she
heard
him
wonder
why
she
had
let
helen
in
you
might
have
given
me
a
knock
with
the
gate
was
another
of
his
remarks
presently
she
heard
herself
speaking
she
or
someone
for
her
said
go
away
henry
came
nearer
he
repeated
margaret
you
look
upset
again
my
dear
give
me
the
keys
what
are
you
doing
with
helen
oh
dearest
do
go
away
and
i
will
manage
it
all
manage
what
he
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
keys
she
might
have
obeyed
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
doctor
stop
that
at
least
she
said
piteously
the
doctor
had
turned
back
and
was
questioning
the
driver
of
helen
cab
a
new
feeling
came
over
her
she
was
fighting
for
women
against
men
she
did
not
care
about
rights
but
if
men
came
into
howards
end
it
should
be
over
her
body
come
this
is
an
odd
beginning
said
her
husband
the
doctor
came
forward
now
and
whispered
two
words
to
wilcox
the
scandal
was
out
sincerely
horrified
henry
stood
gazing
at
the
earth
i
can
not
help
it
said
margaret
do
wait
it
not
my
fault
please
all
four
of
you
to
go
away
now
now
the
flyman
was
whispering
to
crane
we
are
relying
on
you
to
help
us
wilcox
said
the
young
doctor
could
you
go
in
and
persuade
your
sister
to
come
out
on
what
grounds
said
margaret
suddenly
looking
him
straight
in
the
eyes
thinking
it
professional
to
prevaricate
he
murmured
something
about
a
nervous
breakdown
i
beg
your
pardon
but
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
you
are
not
qualified
to
attend
my
sister
mansbridge
if
we
require
your
services
we
will
let
you
know
i
can
diagnose
the
case
more
bluntly
if
you
wish
he
retorted
you
could
but
you
have
not
you
are
therefore
not
qualified
to
attend
my
sister
come
come
margaret
said
henry
never
raising
his
eyes
this
is
a
terrible
business
an
appalling
business
it
doctor
orders
open
the
door
forgive
me
but
i
will
not
i
do
agree
margaret
was
silent
this
business
is
as
broad
as
it
long
contributed
the
doctor
we
had
better
all
work
together
you
need
us
wilcox
and
we
need
you
quite
so
said
henry
i
do
not
need
you
in
the
least
said
margaret
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
anxiously
no
more
does
my
sister
who
is
still
many
weeks
from
her
confinement
margaret
margaret
well
henry
send
your
doctor
away
what
possible
use
is
he
now
wilcox
ran
his
eye
over
the
house
he
had
a
vague
feeling
that
he
must
stand
firm
and
support
the
doctor
he
himself
might
need
support
for
there
was
trouble
ahead
it
all
turns
on
affection
now
said
margaret
affection
do
you
see
resuming
her
usual
methods
she
wrote
the
word
on
the
house
with
her
finger
surely
you
see
i
like
helen
very
much
you
not
so
much
mansbridge
does
know
her
that
all
and
affection
when
reciprocated
gives
rights
put
that
down
in
your
notebook
mansbridge
it
a
useful
formula
henry
told
her
to
be
calm
you
do
know
what
you
want
yourselves
said
margaret
folding
her
arms
for
one
sensible
remark
i
will
let
you
in
but
you
can
not
make
it
you
would
trouble
my
sister
for
no
reason
i
will
not
permit
it
i
stand
here
all
the
day
sooner
mansbridge
said
henry
in
a
low
voice
perhaps
not
now
the
pack
was
breaking
up
at
a
sign
from
his
master
crane
also
went
back
into
the
car
now
henry
you
she
said
gently
none
of
her
bitterness
had
been
directed
at
him
go
away
now
dear
i
shall
want
your
advice
later
no
doubt
forgive
me
if
i
have
been
cross
but
seriously
you
must
go
he
was
too
stupid
to
leave
her
now
it
was
mansbridge
who
called
in
a
low
voice
to
him
i
shall
soon
find
you
down
at
dolly
she
called
as
the
gate
at
last
clanged
between
them
the
fly
moved
out
of
the
way
the
motor
backed
turned
a
little
backed
again
and
turned
in
the
narrow
road
a
string
of
farm
carts
came
up
in
the
middle
but
she
waited
through
all
for
there
was
no
hurry
when
all
was
over
and
the
car
had
started
she
opened
the
door
oh
my
darling
she
said
my
darling
forgive
me
helen
was
standing
in
the
hall
chapter
margaret
bolted
the
door
on
the
inside
then
she
would
have
kissed
her
sister
but
helen
in
a
dignified
voice
that
came
strangely
from
her
said
convenient
you
did
not
tell
me
that
the
books
were
unpacked
i
have
found
nearly
everything
that
i
want
i
told
you
nothing
that
was
true
it
has
been
a
great
surprise
certainly
has
aunt
juley
been
ill
helen
you
would
think
i
invent
that
i
suppose
not
said
helen
turning
away
and
crying
a
very
little
but
one
loses
faith
in
everything
after
this
we
thought
it
was
illness
but
even
then
i
behaved
worthily
helen
selected
another
book
i
ought
not
to
have
consulted
anyone
what
would
our
father
have
thought
of
me
she
did
not
think
of
questioning
her
sister
nor
of
rebuking
her
both
might
be
necessary
in
the
future
but
she
had
first
to
purge
a
greater
crime
than
any
that
helen
could
have
committed
that
want
of
confidence
that
is
the
work
of
the
devil
yes
i
am
annoyed
replied
helen
my
wishes
should
have
been
respected
i
would
have
gone
through
this
meeting
if
it
was
necessary
but
after
aunt
juley
recovered
it
was
not
necessary
planning
my
life
as
i
now
have
to
do
come
away
from
those
books
called
margaret
helen
do
talk
to
me
i
was
just
saying
that
i
have
stopped
living
haphazard
one
ca
go
through
a
great
deal
of
she
missed
out
the
noun
without
planning
one
actions
in
advance
i
am
going
to
have
a
child
in
june
and
in
the
first
place
conversations
discussions
excitement
are
not
good
for
me
i
will
go
through
them
if
necessary
but
only
then
in
the
second
place
i
have
no
right
to
trouble
people
i
can
not
fit
in
with
england
as
i
know
it
i
have
done
something
that
the
english
never
pardon
it
would
not
be
right
for
them
to
pardon
it
so
i
must
live
where
i
am
not
known
but
why
did
you
tell
me
dearest
yes
replied
helen
judicially
i
might
have
but
decided
to
wait
i
believe
you
would
never
have
told
me
oh
yes
i
should
we
have
taken
a
flat
in
munich
margaret
glanced
out
of
window
by
i
mean
myself
and
monica
but
for
her
i
am
and
have
been
and
always
wish
to
be
alone
i
have
not
heard
of
monica
you
would
have
she
an
italian
by
birth
at
least
she
makes
her
living
by
journalism
i
met
her
originally
on
garda
monica
is
much
the
best
person
to
see
me
through
you
are
very
fond
of
her
then
she
has
been
extraordinarily
sensible
with
me
margaret
guessed
at
monica
type
italiano
inglesiato
they
had
named
it
the
crude
feminist
of
the
south
whom
one
respects
but
avoids
and
helen
had
turned
to
it
in
her
need
you
must
not
think
that
we
shall
never
meet
said
helen
with
a
measured
kindness
i
shall
always
have
a
room
for
you
when
you
can
be
spared
and
the
longer
you
can
be
with
me
the
better
but
you
have
understood
yet
meg
and
of
course
it
is
very
difficult
for
you
this
is
a
shock
to
you
it
is
to
me
who
have
been
thinking
over
our
futures
for
many
months
and
they
wo
be
changed
by
a
slight
contretemps
such
as
this
i
can
not
live
in
england
helen
you
not
forgiven
me
for
my
treachery
you
could
talk
like
this
to
me
if
you
had
oh
meg
dear
why
do
we
talk
at
all
she
dropped
a
book
and
sighed
wearily
then
recovering
herself
she
said
tell
me
how
is
it
that
all
the
books
are
down
here
series
of
mistakes
and
a
great
deal
of
the
furniture
has
been
unpacked
all
who
lives
here
then
no
one
i
suppose
you
are
letting
it
though
the
house
is
dead
said
margaret
with
a
frown
why
worry
on
about
it
but
i
am
interested
you
talk
as
if
i
had
lost
all
my
interest
in
life
i
am
still
helen
i
hope
now
this
has
the
feel
of
a
dead
house
the
hall
seems
more
alive
even
than
in
the
old
days
when
it
held
the
wilcoxes
own
things
interested
are
you
very
well
i
must
tell
you
i
suppose
my
husband
lent
it
on
condition
we
but
by
a
mistake
all
our
things
were
unpacked
and
miss
avery
instead
of
she
stopped
look
here
i
ca
go
on
like
this
i
warn
you
i
wo
helen
why
should
you
be
so
miserably
unkind
to
me
simply
because
you
hate
henry
i
do
hate
him
now
said
helen
i
have
stopped
being
a
schoolgirl
and
meg
once
again
i
not
being
unkind
but
as
for
fitting
in
with
your
english
life
no
put
it
out
of
your
head
at
once
imagine
a
visit
from
me
at
ducie
street
it
unthinkable
margaret
could
not
contradict
her
it
was
appalling
to
see
her
quietly
moving
forward
with
her
plans
not
bitter
or
excitable
neither
asserting
innocence
nor
confessing
guilt
merely
desiring
freedom
and
the
company
of
those
who
would
not
blame
her
she
had
been
through
how
much
margaret
did
not
know
but
it
was
enough
to
part
her
from
old
habits
as
well
as
old
friends
tell
me
about
yourself
said
helen
who
had
chosen
her
books
and
was
lingering
over
the
furniture
there
nothing
to
tell
but
your
marriage
has
been
happy
meg
yes
but
i
do
feel
inclined
to
talk
you
feel
as
i
do
not
that
but
i
ca
no
more
can
i
it
is
a
nuisance
but
no
good
trying
something
had
come
between
them
perhaps
it
was
society
which
henceforward
would
exclude
helen
perhaps
it
was
a
third
life
already
potent
as
a
spirit
they
could
find
no
both
suffered
acutely
and
were
not
comforted
by
the
knowledge
that
affection
survived
look
here
meg
is
the
coast
clear
you
mean
that
you
want
to
go
away
from
me
i
suppose
so
dear
old
lady
it
is
any
use
i
knew
we
should
have
nothing
to
say
give
my
love
to
aunt
juley
and
tibby
and
take
more
yourself
than
i
can
say
promise
to
come
and
see
me
in
munich
later
certainly
dearest
for
that
is
all
we
can
do
it
seemed
so
most
ghastly
of
all
was
helen
common
sense
monica
had
been
extraordinarily
good
for
her
i
am
glad
to
have
seen
you
and
the
things
she
looked
at
the
bookcase
lovingly
as
if
she
was
saying
farewell
to
the
past
margaret
unbolted
the
door
she
remarked
the
car
has
gone
and
here
your
cab
she
led
the
way
to
it
glancing
at
the
leaves
and
the
sky
the
spring
had
never
seemed
more
beautiful
the
driver
who
was
leaning
on
the
gate
called
out
please
lady
a
message
and
handed
her
henry
through
the
bars
how
did
this
come
she
asked
crane
had
returned
with
it
almost
at
once
she
read
the
card
with
annoyance
it
was
covered
with
instructions
in
domestic
french
when
she
and
her
sister
had
talked
she
was
to
come
back
for
the
night
to
dolly
il
faut
dormir
sur
ce
sujet
while
helen
was
to
be
found
une
comfortable
chambre
a
the
final
sentence
displeased
her
greatly
until
she
remembered
that
the
charles
had
only
one
spare
room
and
so
could
not
invite
a
third
guest
henry
would
have
done
what
he
could
she
interpreted
helen
had
not
followed
her
into
the
garden
the
door
once
open
she
lost
her
inclination
to
fly
she
remained
in
the
hall
going
from
bookcase
to
table
she
grew
more
like
the
old
helen
irresponsible
and
charming
this
is
wilcox
house
she
inquired
surely
you
remember
howards
end
remember
i
who
remember
everything
but
it
looks
to
be
ours
now
miss
avery
was
extraordinary
said
margaret
her
own
spirits
lightening
a
little
again
she
was
invaded
by
a
slight
feeling
of
disloyalty
but
it
brought
her
relief
and
she
yielded
to
it
she
loved
wilcox
and
would
rather
furnish
her
house
with
our
things
than
think
of
it
empty
in
consequence
here
are
all
the
library
not
all
the
books
she
has
unpacked
the
art
books
in
which
she
may
show
her
sense
and
we
never
used
to
have
the
sword
here
the
sword
looks
well
though
magnificent
yes
does
it
where
the
piano
meg
i
warehoused
that
in
london
why
nothing
curious
too
that
the
carpet
fits
the
carpet
a
mistake
announced
helen
i
know
that
we
had
it
in
london
but
this
floor
ought
to
be
bare
it
is
far
too
beautiful
you
still
have
a
mania
for
would
you
care
to
come
into
the
before
you
start
no
carpet
there
they
went
in
and
each
minute
their
talk
became
more
natural
oh
what
a
place
for
mother
chiffonier
cried
helen
look
at
the
chairs
though
oh
look
at
them
wickham
place
faced
north
did
it
anyhow
it
is
thirty
years
since
any
of
those
chairs
have
felt
the
sun
feel
their
little
backs
are
quite
warm
but
why
has
miss
avery
made
them
set
to
partners
i
shall
just
over
here
meg
put
it
so
that
any
one
sitting
will
see
the
lawn
margaret
moved
a
chair
helen
sat
down
in
it
the
window
too
high
try
a
chair
no
i
do
like
the
so
much
the
beam
has
been
it
would
have
been
so
beautiful
helen
what
a
memory
you
have
for
some
things
perfectly
right
it
a
room
that
men
have
spoilt
through
trying
to
make
it
nice
for
women
men
do
know
what
we
want
and
never
will
i
do
agree
in
two
thousand
years
they
know
but
the
chairs
show
up
wonderfully
look
where
tibby
spilt
the
soup
coffee
it
was
coffee
surely
helen
shook
her
head
impossible
tibby
was
far
too
young
to
be
given
coffee
at
that
time
was
father
alive
yes
then
you
right
and
it
must
have
been
soup
i
was
thinking
of
much
later
that
unsuccessful
visit
of
aunt
juley
when
she
did
realize
that
tibby
had
grown
up
it
was
coffee
then
for
he
threw
it
down
on
purpose
there
was
some
rhyme
coffee
coffee
tea
that
she
said
to
him
every
morning
at
breakfast
wait
a
minute
how
did
it
go
i
know
no
i
do
what
a
detestable
boy
tibby
was
but
the
rhyme
was
simply
awful
no
decent
person
could
have
put
up
with
it
ah
that
greengage
tree
cried
helen
as
if
the
garden
was
also
part
of
their
childhood
why
do
i
connect
it
with
dumbbells
and
there
come
the
chickens
the
grass
wants
cutting
i
love
margaret
interrupted
her
i
have
got
it
she
announced
tea
coffee
tea
br
or
chocolaritee
that
every
morning
for
three
weeks
no
wonder
tibby
was
wild
tibby
is
moderately
a
dear
now
said
helen
there
i
knew
you
say
that
in
the
end
of
course
he
a
dear
a
bell
rang
listen
what
that
helen
said
perhaps
the
wilcoxes
are
beginning
the
siege
what
nonsense
listen
and
the
triviality
faded
from
their
faces
though
it
left
something
behind
the
knowledge
that
they
never
could
be
parted
because
their
love
was
rooted
in
common
things
explanations
and
appeals
had
failed
they
had
tried
for
a
common
and
had
only
made
each
other
unhappy
and
all
the
time
their
salvation
was
lying
round
them
the
past
sanctifying
the
present
the
present
with
wild
declaring
that
there
would
after
all
be
a
future
with
laughter
and
the
voices
of
children
helen
still
smiling
came
up
to
her
sister
she
said
it
is
always
meg
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
the
inner
life
had
paid
solemnly
the
clapper
tolled
no
one
was
in
the
front
margaret
went
to
the
kitchen
and
struggled
between
to
the
window
their
visitor
was
only
a
little
boy
with
a
tin
can
and
triviality
returned
little
boy
what
do
you
want
please
i
am
the
milk
did
miss
avery
send
you
said
margaret
rather
sharply
yes
please
then
take
it
back
and
say
we
require
no
milk
while
she
called
to
helen
no
it
not
the
siege
but
possibly
an
attempt
to
provision
us
against
one
but
i
like
milk
cried
helen
why
send
it
away
do
you
oh
very
well
but
we
nothing
to
put
it
in
and
he
wants
the
can
please
i
to
call
in
the
morning
for
the
can
said
the
boy
the
house
will
be
locked
up
then
in
the
morning
would
i
bring
eggs
too
are
you
the
boy
whom
i
saw
playing
in
the
stacks
last
week
the
child
hung
his
head
well
run
away
and
do
it
again
nice
little
boy
whispered
helen
i
say
what
your
name
mine
helen
tom
that
was
helen
all
over
the
wilcoxes
too
would
ask
a
child
its
name
but
they
never
told
their
names
in
return
tom
this
one
here
is
margaret
and
at
home
another
called
tibby
mine
are
replied
tom
supposing
tibby
to
be
a
rabbit
you
a
very
good
and
rather
a
clever
little
boy
mind
you
come
is
he
charming
undoubtedly
said
margaret
he
is
probably
the
son
of
madge
and
madge
is
dreadful
but
this
place
has
wonderful
powers
what
do
you
mean
i
do
know
because
i
probably
agree
with
you
it
kills
what
is
dreadful
and
makes
what
is
beautiful
live
i
do
agree
said
helen
as
she
sipped
the
milk
but
you
said
that
the
house
was
dead
not
half
an
hour
ago
meaning
that
i
was
dead
i
felt
it
yes
the
house
has
a
surer
life
than
we
even
if
it
was
empty
and
as
it
is
i
ca
get
over
that
for
thirty
years
the
sun
has
never
shone
full
on
our
furniture
after
all
wickham
place
was
a
grave
meg
i
a
startling
idea
what
is
it
drink
some
milk
to
steady
you
margaret
obeyed
no
i
wo
tell
you
yet
said
helen
because
you
may
laugh
or
be
angry
let
go
upstairs
first
and
give
the
rooms
an
airing
they
opened
window
after
window
till
the
inside
too
was
rustling
to
the
spring
curtains
blew
tapped
cheerfully
helen
uttered
cries
of
excitement
as
she
found
this
bed
obviously
in
its
right
place
that
in
its
wrong
one
she
was
angry
with
miss
avery
for
not
having
moved
the
wardrobes
up
then
one
would
see
really
she
admired
the
view
she
was
the
helen
who
had
written
the
memorable
letters
four
years
ago
as
they
leant
out
looking
westward
she
said
about
my
idea
could
you
and
i
camp
out
in
this
house
for
the
night
i
do
think
we
could
well
do
that
said
margaret
here
are
beds
tables
towels
i
know
but
the
house
is
supposed
to
be
slept
in
and
henry
suggestion
was
i
require
no
suggestions
i
shall
not
alter
anything
in
my
plans
but
it
would
give
me
so
much
pleasure
to
have
one
night
here
with
you
it
will
be
something
to
look
back
on
oh
meg
lovey
do
let
but
helen
my
pet
said
margaret
we
ca
without
getting
henry
leave
of
course
he
would
give
it
but
you
said
yourself
that
you
could
visit
at
ducie
street
now
and
this
is
equally
intimate
ducie
street
is
his
house
this
is
ours
our
furniture
our
sort
of
people
coming
to
the
door
do
let
us
camp
out
just
one
night
and
tom
shall
feed
us
on
eggs
and
milk
why
not
it
a
moon
margaret
hesitated
i
feel
charles
would
like
it
she
said
at
last
even
our
furniture
annoyed
him
and
i
was
going
to
clear
it
out
when
aunt
juley
illness
prevented
me
i
sympathize
with
charles
he
feels
it
his
mother
house
he
loves
it
in
rather
an
untaking
way
henry
i
could
answer
for
not
charles
i
know
he
wo
like
it
said
helen
but
i
am
going
to
pass
out
of
their
lives
what
difference
will
it
make
in
the
long
run
if
they
say
she
even
spent
the
night
at
howards
end
how
do
you
know
you
pass
out
of
their
lives
we
have
thought
that
twice
before
because
my
plans
which
you
change
in
a
moment
then
because
my
life
is
great
and
theirs
are
little
said
helen
taking
fire
i
know
of
things
they
ca
know
of
and
so
do
you
we
know
that
there
poetry
we
know
that
there
death
they
can
only
take
them
on
hearsay
we
know
this
is
our
house
because
it
feels
ours
oh
they
may
take
the
and
the
doorkeys
but
for
this
one
night
we
are
at
home
it
would
be
lovely
to
have
you
once
more
alone
said
margaret
it
may
be
a
chance
in
a
thousand
yes
and
we
could
talk
she
dropped
her
voice
it
wo
be
a
very
glorious
story
but
under
that
honestly
i
see
little
happiness
ahead
can
not
i
have
this
one
night
with
you
i
need
say
how
much
it
would
mean
to
me
then
let
us
it
is
no
good
hesitating
shall
i
drive
down
to
hilton
now
and
get
leave
oh
we
do
want
leave
but
margaret
was
a
loyal
wife
in
spite
of
imagination
and
poetry
perhaps
on
account
of
them
she
could
sympathize
with
the
technical
attitude
that
henry
would
adopt
if
possible
she
would
be
technical
too
a
lodging
and
they
demanded
no
more
need
not
involve
the
discussion
of
general
principles
charles
may
say
no
grumbled
helen
we
sha
consult
him
go
if
you
like
i
should
have
stopped
without
leave
it
was
the
touch
of
selfishness
which
was
not
enough
to
mar
helen
character
and
even
added
to
its
beauty
she
would
have
stopped
without
leave
and
escaped
to
germany
the
next
morning
margaret
kissed
her
expect
me
back
before
dark
i
am
looking
forward
to
it
so
much
it
is
like
you
to
have
thought
of
such
a
beautiful
thing
not
a
thing
only
an
ending
said
helen
rather
sadly
and
the
sense
of
tragedy
closed
in
on
margaret
again
as
soon
as
she
left
the
house
she
was
afraid
of
miss
avery
it
is
disquieting
to
fulfil
a
prophecy
however
superficially
she
was
glad
to
see
no
watching
figure
as
she
drove
past
the
farm
but
only
little
tom
turning
somersaults
in
the
straw
chapter
the
tragedy
began
quietly
enough
and
like
many
another
talk
by
the
man
deft
assertion
of
his
superiority
henry
heard
her
arguing
with
the
driver
stepped
out
and
settled
the
fellow
who
was
inclined
to
be
rude
and
then
led
the
way
to
some
chairs
on
the
lawn
dolly
who
had
not
been
told
ran
out
with
offers
of
tea
he
refused
them
and
ordered
her
to
wheel
baby
perambulator
away
as
they
desired
to
be
alone
but
the
diddums
ca
listen
he
is
nine
months
old
she
pleaded
that
not
what
i
was
saying
retorted
her
baby
was
wheeled
out
of
earshot
and
did
not
hear
about
the
crisis
till
later
years
it
was
now
the
turn
of
margaret
is
it
what
we
feared
he
asked
it
is
dear
girl
he
began
there
is
a
troublesome
business
ahead
of
us
and
nothing
but
the
most
absolute
honesty
and
plain
speech
will
see
us
through
margaret
bent
her
head
i
am
obliged
to
question
you
on
subjects
we
both
prefer
to
leave
untouched
as
you
know
i
am
not
one
of
your
bernard
shaws
who
consider
nothing
sacred
to
speak
as
i
must
will
pain
me
but
there
are
occasions
we
are
husband
and
wife
not
children
i
am
a
man
of
the
world
and
you
are
a
most
exceptional
woman
all
margaret
senses
forsook
her
she
blushed
and
looked
past
him
at
the
six
hills
covered
with
spring
herbage
noting
her
colour
he
grew
still
more
kind
i
see
that
you
feel
as
i
felt
when
my
poor
little
wife
oh
be
brave
just
one
or
two
questions
and
i
have
done
with
you
was
your
sister
wearing
a
margaret
stammered
a
no
there
was
an
appalling
silence
henry
i
really
came
to
ask
a
favour
about
howards
end
one
point
at
a
time
i
am
now
obliged
to
ask
for
the
name
of
her
seducer
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
held
the
chair
between
them
her
colour
had
ebbed
and
she
was
grey
it
did
not
displease
him
that
she
should
receive
his
question
thus
take
your
time
he
counselled
her
remember
that
this
is
far
worse
for
me
than
for
you
she
swayed
he
feared
she
was
going
to
faint
then
speech
came
and
she
said
slowly
seducer
no
i
do
not
know
her
seducer
name
would
she
not
tell
you
i
never
even
asked
her
who
seduced
her
said
margaret
dwelling
on
the
hateful
word
thoughtfully
that
is
singular
then
he
changed
his
mind
natural
perhaps
dear
girl
that
you
should
ask
but
until
his
name
is
known
nothing
can
be
done
sit
down
how
terrible
it
is
to
see
you
so
upset
i
knew
you
were
fit
for
it
i
wish
i
had
taken
you
margaret
answered
i
like
to
stand
if
you
do
mind
for
it
gives
me
a
pleasant
view
of
the
six
hills
as
you
like
have
you
anything
else
to
ask
me
henry
next
you
must
tell
me
whether
you
have
gathered
anything
i
have
often
noticed
your
insight
dear
i
only
wish
my
own
was
as
good
you
may
have
guessed
something
even
though
your
sister
said
nothing
the
slightest
hint
would
help
us
who
is
i
thought
it
best
to
ring
up
charles
that
was
unnecessary
said
margaret
growing
warmer
this
news
will
give
charles
disproportionate
pain
he
has
at
once
gone
to
call
on
your
brother
that
too
was
unnecessary
let
me
explain
dear
how
the
matter
stands
you
think
that
i
and
my
son
are
other
than
gentlemen
it
is
in
helen
interests
that
we
are
acting
it
is
still
not
too
late
to
save
her
name
then
margaret
hit
out
for
the
first
time
are
we
to
make
her
seducer
marry
her
she
asked
if
possible
yes
but
henry
suppose
he
turned
out
to
be
married
already
one
has
heard
of
such
cases
in
that
case
he
must
pay
heavily
for
his
misconduct
and
be
thrashed
within
an
inch
of
his
life
so
her
first
blow
missed
she
was
thankful
of
it
what
had
tempted
her
to
imperil
both
of
their
lives
obtuseness
had
saved
her
as
well
as
himself
exhausted
with
anger
she
sat
down
again
blinking
at
him
as
he
told
her
as
much
as
he
thought
fit
at
last
she
said
may
i
ask
you
my
question
now
certainly
my
dear
tomorrow
helen
goes
to
munich
well
possibly
she
is
right
henry
let
a
lady
finish
tomorrow
she
goes
tonight
with
your
permission
she
would
like
to
sleep
at
howards
end
it
was
the
crisis
of
his
life
again
she
would
have
recalled
the
words
as
soon
as
they
were
uttered
she
had
not
led
up
to
them
with
sufficient
care
she
longed
to
warn
him
that
they
were
far
more
important
than
he
supposed
she
saw
him
weighing
them
as
if
they
were
a
business
proposition
why
howards
end
he
said
at
last
would
she
not
be
more
comfortable
as
i
suggested
at
the
hotel
margaret
hastened
to
give
him
reasons
it
is
an
odd
request
but
you
know
what
helen
is
and
what
women
in
her
state
are
he
frowned
and
moved
irritably
she
has
the
idea
that
one
night
in
your
house
would
give
her
pleasure
and
do
her
good
i
think
she
right
being
one
of
those
imaginative
girls
the
presence
of
all
our
books
and
furniture
soothes
her
this
is
a
fact
it
is
the
end
of
her
girlhood
her
last
words
to
me
were
beautiful
ending
she
values
the
old
furniture
for
sentimental
reasons
in
fact
exactly
you
have
quite
understood
it
is
her
last
hope
of
being
with
it
i
do
agree
there
my
dear
helen
will
have
her
share
of
the
goods
wherever
she
goes
possibly
more
than
her
share
for
you
are
so
fond
of
her
that
you
give
her
anything
of
yours
that
she
fancies
would
you
and
raise
no
objection
i
could
understand
it
if
it
was
her
old
home
because
a
home
or
a
house
he
changed
the
word
designedly
he
had
thought
of
a
telling
point
because
a
house
in
which
one
has
once
lived
becomes
in
a
sort
of
way
sacred
i
do
know
why
associations
and
so
on
now
helen
has
no
associations
with
howards
end
though
i
and
charles
and
evie
have
i
do
not
see
why
she
wants
to
stay
the
night
there
she
will
only
catch
cold
leave
it
that
you
do
see
cried
margaret
call
it
fancy
but
realize
that
fancy
is
a
scientific
fact
helen
is
fanciful
and
wants
to
then
he
surprised
her
a
rare
occurrence
he
shot
an
unexpected
bolt
if
she
wants
to
sleep
one
night
she
may
want
to
sleep
two
we
shall
never
get
her
out
of
the
house
perhaps
well
said
margaret
with
the
precipice
in
sight
and
suppose
we
do
get
her
out
of
the
house
would
it
matter
she
would
do
no
one
any
harm
again
the
irritated
gesture
no
henry
she
panted
receding
i
did
mean
that
we
will
only
trouble
howards
end
for
this
one
night
i
take
her
to
london
tomorrow
do
you
intend
to
sleep
in
a
damp
house
too
she
can
not
be
left
alone
that
quite
impossible
madness
you
must
be
here
to
meet
charles
i
have
already
told
you
that
your
message
to
charles
was
unnecessary
and
i
have
no
desire
to
meet
him
margaret
my
margaret
what
has
this
business
to
do
with
charles
if
it
concerns
me
little
it
concerns
you
less
and
charles
not
at
all
as
the
future
owner
of
howards
end
said
wilcox
arching
his
fingers
i
should
say
that
it
did
concern
charles
in
what
way
will
helen
condition
depreciate
the
property
my
dear
you
are
forgetting
yourself
i
think
you
yourself
recommended
plain
speaking
they
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
the
precipice
was
at
their
feet
now
helen
commands
my
sympathy
said
henry
as
your
husband
i
shall
do
all
for
her
that
i
can
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
will
prove
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
but
i
can
not
treat
her
as
if
nothing
has
happened
i
should
be
false
to
my
position
in
society
if
i
did
she
controlled
herself
for
the
last
time
no
let
us
go
back
to
helen
request
she
said
it
is
unreasonable
but
the
request
of
an
unhappy
girl
tomorrow
she
will
go
to
germany
and
trouble
society
no
longer
tonight
she
asks
to
sleep
in
your
empty
house
a
house
which
you
do
not
care
about
and
which
you
have
not
occupied
for
over
a
year
may
she
will
you
give
my
sister
leave
will
you
forgive
her
as
you
hope
to
be
forgiven
and
as
you
have
actually
been
forgiven
forgive
her
for
one
night
only
that
will
be
enough
as
i
have
actually
been
forgiven
never
mind
for
the
moment
what
i
mean
by
that
said
margaret
answer
my
question
perhaps
some
hint
of
her
meaning
did
dawn
on
him
if
so
he
blotted
it
out
straight
from
his
fortress
he
answered
i
seem
rather
unaccommodating
but
i
have
some
experience
of
life
and
know
how
one
thing
leads
to
another
i
am
afraid
that
your
sister
had
better
sleep
at
the
hotel
i
have
my
children
and
the
memory
of
my
dear
wife
to
consider
i
am
sorry
but
see
that
she
leaves
my
house
at
once
you
mentioned
mrs
wilcox
i
beg
your
pardon
a
rare
occurrence
in
reply
may
i
mention
mrs
bast
you
have
not
been
yourself
all
day
said
henry
and
rose
from
his
seat
with
face
unmoved
margaret
rushed
at
him
and
seized
both
his
hands
she
was
transfigured
not
any
more
of
this
she
cried
you
shall
see
the
connection
if
it
kills
you
henry
you
have
had
a
mistress
i
forgave
you
my
sister
has
a
lover
you
drive
her
from
the
house
do
you
see
the
connection
stupid
hypocritical
cruel
oh
contemptible
a
man
who
insults
his
wife
when
she
alive
and
cants
with
her
memory
when
she
dead
a
man
who
ruins
a
woman
for
his
pleasure
and
casts
her
off
to
ruin
other
men
and
gives
bad
financial
advice
and
then
says
he
is
not
responsible
these
man
are
you
you
ca
recognize
them
because
you
can
not
connect
i
had
enough
of
your
unweeded
kindness
spoilt
you
long
enough
all
your
life
you
have
been
spoiled
wilcox
spoiled
you
no
one
has
ever
told
what
you
are
muddled
criminally
muddled
men
like
you
use
repentance
as
a
blind
so
do
repent
only
say
to
yourself
helen
has
done
i
done
the
two
cases
are
different
henry
stammered
his
real
retort
was
not
quite
ready
his
brain
was
still
in
a
whirl
and
he
wanted
a
little
longer
in
what
way
different
you
have
betrayed
wilcox
helen
only
herself
you
remain
in
society
helen
ca
you
have
had
only
pleasure
she
may
die
you
have
the
insolence
to
talk
to
me
of
differences
henry
oh
the
uselessness
of
it
henry
retort
came
i
perceive
you
are
attempting
blackmail
it
is
scarcely
a
pretty
weapon
for
a
wife
to
use
against
her
husband
my
rule
through
life
has
been
never
to
pay
the
least
attention
to
threats
and
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
said
before
i
do
not
give
you
and
your
sister
leave
to
sleep
at
howards
end
margaret
loosed
his
hands
he
went
into
the
house
wiping
first
one
and
then
the
other
on
his
handkerchief
for
a
little
she
stood
looking
at
the
six
hills
tombs
of
warriors
breasts
of
the
spring
then
she
passed
out
into
what
was
now
the
evening
chapter
charles
and
tibby
met
at
ducie
street
where
the
latter
was
staying
their
interview
was
short
and
absurd
they
had
nothing
in
common
but
the
english
language
and
tried
by
its
help
to
express
what
neither
of
them
understood
charles
saw
in
helen
the
family
foe
he
had
singled
her
out
as
the
most
dangerous
of
the
schlegels
and
angry
as
he
was
looked
forward
to
telling
his
wife
how
right
he
had
been
his
mind
was
made
up
at
once
the
girl
must
be
got
out
of
the
way
before
she
disgraced
them
farther
if
occasion
offered
she
might
be
married
to
a
villain
or
possibly
to
a
fool
but
this
was
a
concession
to
morality
it
formed
no
part
of
his
main
scheme
honest
and
hearty
was
dislike
and
the
past
spread
itself
out
very
clearly
before
him
hatred
is
a
skilful
compositor
as
if
they
were
heads
in
a
he
ran
through
all
the
incidents
of
the
schlegels
campaign
the
attempt
to
compromise
his
brother
his
mother
legacy
his
father
marriage
the
introduction
of
the
furniture
the
unpacking
of
the
same
he
had
not
yet
heard
of
the
request
to
sleep
at
howards
end
that
was
to
be
their
and
the
opportunity
for
his
but
he
already
felt
that
howards
end
was
the
objective
and
though
he
disliked
the
house
was
determined
to
defend
it
tibby
on
the
other
hand
had
no
opinions
he
stood
above
the
conventions
his
sister
had
a
right
to
do
what
she
thought
right
it
is
not
difficult
to
stand
above
the
conventions
when
we
leave
no
hostages
among
them
men
can
always
be
more
unconventional
than
women
and
a
bachelor
of
independent
means
need
encounter
no
difficulties
at
all
unlike
charles
tibby
had
money
enough
his
ancestors
had
earned
it
for
him
and
if
he
shocked
the
people
in
one
set
of
lodgings
he
had
only
to
move
into
another
his
was
the
leisure
without
sympathy
an
attitude
as
fatal
as
the
strenuous
a
little
cold
culture
may
be
raised
on
it
but
no
art
his
sisters
had
seen
the
family
danger
and
had
never
forgotten
to
discount
the
gold
islets
that
raised
them
from
the
sea
tibby
gave
all
the
praise
to
himself
and
so
despised
the
struggling
and
the
submerged
hence
the
absurdity
of
the
interview
the
gulf
between
them
was
economic
as
well
as
spiritual
but
several
facts
passed
charles
pressed
for
them
with
an
impertinence
that
the
undergraduate
could
not
withstand
on
what
date
had
helen
gone
abroad
to
whom
charles
was
anxious
to
fasten
the
scandal
on
germany
then
changing
his
tactics
he
said
roughly
i
suppose
you
realize
that
you
are
your
protector
in
what
sense
if
a
man
played
about
with
my
sister
i
send
a
bullet
through
him
but
perhaps
you
do
mind
i
mind
very
much
protested
tibby
who
d
suspect
then
speak
out
man
one
always
suspects
someone
no
one
i
do
think
so
involuntarily
he
blushed
he
had
remembered
the
scene
in
his
oxford
rooms
you
are
hiding
something
said
charles
as
interviews
go
he
got
the
best
of
this
one
when
you
saw
her
last
did
she
mention
anyone
name
yes
or
no
he
thundered
so
that
tibby
started
in
my
rooms
she
mentioned
some
friends
called
the
basts
who
are
the
basts
people
friends
of
hers
at
evie
wedding
i
do
remember
but
by
great
scott
i
do
my
aunt
told
me
about
some
was
she
full
of
them
when
you
saw
her
is
there
a
man
did
she
speak
of
the
man
or
look
here
have
you
had
any
dealings
with
him
tibby
was
silent
without
intending
it
he
had
betrayed
his
sister
confidence
he
was
not
enough
interested
in
human
life
to
see
where
things
will
lead
to
he
had
a
strong
regard
for
honesty
and
his
word
once
given
had
always
been
kept
up
to
now
he
was
deeply
vexed
not
only
for
the
harm
he
had
done
helen
but
for
the
flaw
he
had
discovered
in
his
own
equipment
i
see
you
are
in
his
confidence
they
met
at
your
rooms
oh
what
a
family
what
a
family
god
help
the
poor
pater
and
tibby
found
himself
alone
chapter
leonard
he
would
figure
at
length
in
a
newspaper
report
but
that
evening
he
did
not
count
for
much
the
foot
of
the
tree
was
in
shadow
since
the
moon
was
still
hidden
behind
the
house
but
above
to
right
to
left
down
the
long
meadow
the
moonlight
was
streaming
leonard
seemed
not
a
man
but
a
cause
perhaps
it
was
helen
way
of
falling
in
love
a
curious
way
to
margaret
whose
agony
and
whose
contempt
of
henry
were
yet
imprinted
with
his
image
helen
forgot
people
they
were
husks
that
had
enclosed
her
emotion
she
could
pity
or
sacrifice
herself
or
have
instincts
but
had
she
ever
loved
in
the
noblest
way
where
man
and
woman
having
lost
themselves
in
sex
desire
to
lose
sex
itself
in
comradeship
margaret
wondered
but
said
no
word
of
blame
this
was
helen
evening
troubles
enough
lay
ahead
of
her
the
loss
of
friends
and
of
social
advantages
the
agony
the
supreme
agony
of
motherhood
which
is
even
yet
not
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
for
the
present
let
the
moon
shine
brightly
and
the
breezes
of
the
spring
blow
gently
dying
away
from
the
gale
of
the
day
and
let
the
earth
who
brings
increase
bring
peace
not
even
to
herself
dare
she
blame
helen
she
could
not
assess
her
trespass
by
any
moral
code
it
was
everything
or
nothing
morality
can
tell
us
that
murder
is
worse
than
stealing
and
group
most
sins
in
an
order
all
must
approve
but
it
can
not
group
helen
the
surer
its
pronouncements
on
this
point
the
surer
may
we
be
that
morality
is
not
speaking
christ
was
evasive
when
they
questioned
him
it
is
those
that
can
not
connect
who
hasten
to
cast
the
first
stone
this
was
helen
evening
won
at
what
cost
and
not
to
be
marred
by
the
sorrows
of
others
of
her
own
tragedy
margaret
never
uttered
a
word
one
isolates
said
helen
slowly
i
isolated
wilcox
from
the
other
forces
that
were
pulling
leonard
downhill
consequently
i
was
full
of
pity
and
almost
of
revenge
for
weeks
i
had
blamed
wilcox
only
and
so
when
your
letters
came
i
need
never
have
written
them
sighed
margaret
they
never
shielded
henry
how
hopeless
it
is
to
tidy
away
the
past
even
for
others
i
did
not
know
that
it
was
your
own
idea
to
dismiss
the
basts
looking
back
that
was
wrong
of
me
looking
back
darling
i
know
that
it
was
right
it
is
right
to
save
the
man
whom
one
loves
i
am
less
enthusiastic
about
justice
now
but
we
both
thought
you
wrote
at
his
dictation
it
seemed
the
last
touch
of
his
callousness
being
very
much
wrought
up
by
this
time
and
bast
was
upstairs
i
had
not
seen
her
and
had
talked
for
a
long
time
to
leonard
i
had
snubbed
him
for
no
reason
and
that
should
have
warned
me
i
was
in
danger
so
when
the
notes
came
i
wanted
us
to
go
to
you
for
an
explanation
he
said
that
he
guessed
the
explanation
he
knew
of
it
and
you
must
know
i
pressed
him
to
tell
me
he
said
no
one
must
know
it
was
something
to
do
with
his
wife
right
up
to
the
end
we
were
bast
and
miss
schlegel
i
was
going
to
tell
him
that
he
must
be
frank
with
me
when
i
saw
his
eyes
and
guessed
that
wilcox
had
ruined
him
in
two
ways
not
one
i
drew
him
to
me
i
made
him
tell
me
i
felt
very
lonely
myself
he
is
not
to
blame
he
would
have
gone
on
worshipping
me
i
want
never
to
see
him
again
though
it
sounds
appalling
i
wanted
to
give
him
money
and
feel
finished
oh
meg
the
little
that
is
known
about
these
things
she
laid
her
face
against
the
tree
the
little
too
that
is
known
about
growth
both
times
it
was
loneliness
and
the
night
and
panic
afterwards
did
leonard
grow
out
of
paul
margaret
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
so
tired
was
she
that
her
attention
had
actually
wandered
to
the
teeth
the
teeth
that
had
been
thrust
into
the
tree
bark
to
medicate
it
from
where
she
sat
she
could
see
them
gleam
she
had
been
trying
to
count
them
leonard
is
a
better
growth
than
madness
she
said
i
was
afraid
that
you
would
react
against
paul
until
you
went
over
the
verge
i
did
react
until
i
found
poor
leonard
i
am
steady
now
i
sha
ever
like
your
henry
dearest
meg
or
even
speak
kindly
about
him
but
all
that
blinding
hate
is
over
i
shall
never
rave
against
wilcoxes
any
more
i
understand
how
you
married
him
and
you
will
now
be
very
happy
margaret
did
not
reply
yes
repeated
helen
her
voice
growing
more
tender
i
do
at
last
understand
except
wilcox
dearest
no
one
understands
our
little
movements
because
in
death
i
agree
not
quite
i
feel
that
you
and
i
and
henry
are
only
fragments
of
that
woman
mind
she
knows
everything
she
is
everything
she
is
the
house
and
the
tree
that
leans
over
it
people
have
their
own
deaths
as
well
as
their
own
lives
and
even
if
there
is
nothing
beyond
death
we
shall
differ
in
our
nothingness
i
can
not
believe
that
knowledge
such
as
hers
will
perish
with
knowledge
such
as
mine
she
knew
about
realities
she
knew
when
people
were
in
love
though
she
was
not
in
the
room
i
do
doubt
that
she
knew
when
henry
deceived
her
wilcox
called
a
voice
oh
miss
avery
why
should
miss
avery
work
for
us
helen
murmured
why
indeed
miss
avery
crossed
the
lawn
and
merged
into
the
hedge
that
divided
it
from
the
farm
an
old
gap
which
wilcox
had
filled
up
had
reappeared
and
her
track
through
the
dew
followed
the
path
that
he
had
turfed
over
when
he
improved
the
garden
and
made
it
possible
for
games
this
is
not
quite
our
house
yet
said
helen
when
miss
avery
called
i
felt
we
are
only
a
couple
of
tourists
we
shall
be
that
everywhere
and
for
ever
but
affectionate
tourists
but
tourists
who
pretend
each
hotel
is
their
home
i
ca
pretend
very
long
said
helen
sitting
under
this
tree
one
forgets
but
i
know
that
tomorrow
i
shall
see
the
moon
rise
out
of
germany
not
all
your
goodness
can
alter
the
facts
of
the
case
unless
you
will
come
with
me
margaret
thought
for
a
moment
in
the
past
year
she
had
grown
so
fond
of
england
that
to
leave
it
was
a
real
grief
yet
what
detained
her
no
doubt
henry
would
pardon
her
outburst
and
go
on
blustering
and
muddling
into
a
ripe
old
age
but
what
was
the
good
she
had
just
as
soon
vanish
from
his
mind
are
you
serious
in
asking
me
helen
should
i
get
on
with
your
monica
you
would
not
but
i
am
serious
in
asking
you
still
no
more
plans
now
and
no
more
reminiscences
they
were
silent
for
a
little
it
was
helen
evening
the
present
flowed
by
them
like
a
stream
the
tree
rustled
it
had
made
music
before
they
were
born
and
would
continue
after
their
deaths
but
its
song
was
of
the
moment
the
moment
had
passed
the
tree
rustled
again
their
senses
were
sharpened
and
they
seemed
to
apprehend
life
life
passed
the
tree
nestled
again
sleep
now
said
margaret
the
peace
of
the
country
was
entering
into
her
it
has
no
commerce
with
memory
and
little
with
hope
least
of
all
is
it
concerned
with
the
hopes
of
the
next
five
minutes
it
is
the
peace
of
the
present
which
passes
understanding
its
murmur
came
now
and
now
once
more
as
they
trod
the
gravel
and
now
as
the
moonlight
fell
upon
their
sword
they
passed
upstairs
kissed
and
amidst
the
endless
iterations
fell
asleep
the
house
had
enshadowed
the
tree
at
first
but
as
the
moon
rose
higher
the
two
disentangled
and
were
clear
for
a
few
moments
at
midnight
margaret
awoke
and
looked
into
the
garden
how
incomprehensible
that
leonard
bast
should
have
won
her
this
night
of
peace
was
he
also
part
of
wilcox
mind
chapter
far
different
was
leonard
development
the
months
after
oniton
whatever
minor
troubles
they
might
bring
him
were
all
overshadowed
by
remorse
when
helen
looked
back
she
could
philosophize
or
she
could
look
into
the
future
and
plan
for
her
child
but
the
father
saw
nothing
beyond
his
own
sin
weeks
afterwards
in
the
midst
of
other
occupations
he
would
suddenly
cry
out
brute
you
brute
i
could
have
and
be
rent
into
two
people
who
held
dialogues
or
brown
rain
would
descend
blotting
out
faces
and
the
sky
even
jacky
noticed
the
change
in
him
most
terrible
were
his
sufferings
when
he
awoke
from
sleep
sometimes
he
was
happy
at
first
but
grew
conscious
of
a
burden
hanging
to
him
and
weighing
down
his
thoughts
when
they
would
move
or
little
irons
scorched
his
body
or
a
sword
stabbed
him
he
would
sit
at
the
edge
of
his
bed
holding
his
heart
and
moaning
oh
what
shall
i
do
whatever
shall
i
do
nothing
brought
ease
he
could
put
distance
between
him
and
the
trespass
but
it
grew
in
his
soul
remorse
is
not
among
the
eternal
verities
the
greeks
were
right
to
dethrone
her
her
action
is
too
capricious
as
though
the
erinyes
selected
for
punishment
only
certain
men
and
certain
sins
and
of
all
means
to
regeneration
remorse
is
surely
the
most
wasteful
it
cuts
away
healthy
tissues
with
the
poisoned
it
is
a
knife
that
probes
far
deeper
than
the
evil
leonard
was
driven
straight
through
its
torments
and
emerged
pure
but
enfeebled
a
better
man
who
would
never
lose
control
of
himself
again
but
also
a
smaller
who
had
less
to
control
nor
did
purity
mean
peace
the
use
of
the
knife
can
become
a
habit
as
hard
to
shake
off
as
passion
itself
and
leonard
continued
to
start
with
a
cry
out
of
dreams
he
built
up
a
situation
that
was
far
enough
from
the
truth
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
helen
was
to
blame
he
forgot
the
intensity
of
their
talk
the
charm
that
had
been
lent
him
by
sincerity
the
magic
of
oniton
under
darkness
and
of
the
whispering
river
helen
loved
the
absolute
leonard
had
been
ruined
absolutely
and
had
appeared
to
her
as
a
man
apart
isolated
from
the
world
a
real
man
who
cared
for
adventure
and
beauty
who
desired
to
live
decently
and
pay
his
way
who
could
have
travelled
more
gloriously
through
life
than
the
juggernaut
car
that
was
crushing
him
memories
of
evie
wedding
had
warped
her
the
starched
servants
the
yards
of
uneaten
food
the
rustle
of
overdressed
women
oozing
grease
on
the
gravel
rubbish
on
a
pretentious
band
she
had
tasted
the
lees
of
this
on
her
arrival
in
the
darkness
after
failure
they
intoxicated
her
she
and
the
victim
seemed
alone
in
a
world
of
unreality
and
she
loved
him
absolutely
perhaps
for
half
an
hour
in
the
morning
she
was
gone
the
note
that
she
left
tender
and
hysterical
in
tone
and
intended
to
be
most
kind
hurt
her
lover
terribly
it
was
as
if
some
work
of
art
had
been
broken
by
him
some
picture
in
the
national
gallery
slashed
out
of
its
frame
when
he
recalled
her
talents
and
her
social
position
he
felt
that
the
first
passerby
had
a
right
to
shoot
him
down
he
was
afraid
of
the
waitress
and
the
porters
at
the
he
was
afraid
at
first
of
his
wife
though
later
he
was
to
regard
her
with
a
strange
new
tenderness
and
to
think
there
is
nothing
to
choose
between
us
after
all
the
expedition
to
shropshire
crippled
the
basts
permanently
helen
in
her
flight
forgot
to
settle
the
hotel
bill
and
took
their
return
tickets
away
with
her
they
had
to
pawn
jacky
bangles
to
get
home
and
the
smash
came
a
few
days
afterwards
it
is
true
that
helen
offered
him
five
thousands
pounds
but
such
a
sum
meant
nothing
to
him
he
could
not
see
that
the
girl
was
desperately
righting
herself
and
trying
to
save
something
out
of
the
disaster
if
it
was
only
five
thousand
pounds
but
he
had
to
live
somehow
he
turned
to
his
family
and
degraded
himself
to
a
professional
beggar
there
was
nothing
else
for
him
to
do
a
letter
from
leonard
thought
blanche
his
sister
and
after
all
this
time
she
hid
it
so
that
her
husband
should
not
see
and
when
he
had
gone
to
his
work
read
it
with
some
emotion
and
sent
the
prodigal
a
little
money
out
of
her
dress
allowance
a
letter
from
leonard
said
the
other
sister
laura
a
few
days
later
she
showed
it
to
her
husband
he
wrote
a
cruel
insolent
reply
but
sent
more
money
than
blanche
so
leonard
soon
wrote
to
him
again
and
during
the
winter
the
system
was
developed
leonard
realized
that
they
need
never
starve
because
it
would
be
too
painful
for
his
relatives
society
is
based
on
the
family
and
the
clever
wastrel
can
exploit
this
indefinitely
without
a
generous
thought
on
either
side
pounds
and
pounds
passed
the
donors
disliked
leonard
and
he
grew
to
hate
them
intensely
when
laura
censured
his
immoral
marriage
he
thought
bitterly
she
minds
that
what
would
she
say
if
she
knew
the
truth
when
husband
offered
him
work
he
found
some
pretext
for
avoiding
it
he
had
wanted
work
keenly
at
oniton
but
too
much
anxiety
had
shattered
him
he
was
joining
the
unemployable
when
his
brother
the
did
not
reply
to
a
letter
he
wrote
again
saying
that
he
and
jacky
would
come
down
to
his
village
on
foot
he
did
not
intend
this
as
blackmail
still
the
brother
sent
a
postal
order
and
it
became
part
of
the
system
and
so
passed
his
winter
and
his
spring
in
the
horror
there
are
two
bright
spots
he
never
confused
the
past
he
remained
alive
and
blessed
are
those
who
live
if
it
is
only
to
a
sense
of
sinfulness
the
anodyne
of
muddledom
by
which
most
men
blur
and
blend
their
mistakes
never
passed
leonard
lips
and
if
i
drink
oblivion
of
a
day
so
shorten
i
the
stature
of
my
soul
it
is
a
hard
saying
and
a
hard
man
wrote
it
but
it
lies
at
the
foot
of
all
character
and
the
other
bright
spot
was
his
tenderness
for
jacky
he
pitied
her
with
nobility
now
not
the
contemptuous
pity
of
a
man
who
sticks
to
a
woman
through
thick
and
thin
he
tried
to
be
less
irritable
he
wondered
what
her
hungry
eyes
desired
nothing
that
she
could
express
or
that
he
or
any
man
could
give
her
would
she
ever
receive
the
justice
that
is
mercy
the
justice
for
that
the
world
is
too
busy
to
bestow
she
was
fond
of
flowers
generous
with
money
and
not
revengeful
if
she
had
borne
him
a
child
he
might
have
cared
for
her
unmarried
leonard
would
never
have
begged
he
would
have
flickered
out
and
died
but
the
whole
of
life
is
mixed
he
had
to
provide
for
jacky
and
went
down
dirty
paths
that
she
might
have
a
few
feathers
and
dishes
of
food
that
suited
her
one
day
he
caught
sight
of
margaret
and
her
brother
he
was
in
paul
he
had
entered
the
cathedral
partly
to
avoid
the
rain
and
partly
to
see
a
picture
that
had
educated
him
in
former
years
but
the
light
was
bad
the
picture
ill
placed
and
time
and
judgment
were
inside
him
now
death
alone
still
charmed
him
with
her
lap
of
poppies
on
which
all
men
shall
sleep
he
took
one
glance
and
turned
aimlessly
away
towards
a
chair
then
down
the
nave
he
saw
miss
schlegel
and
her
brother
they
stood
in
the
fairway
of
passengers
and
their
faces
were
extremely
grave
he
was
perfectly
certain
that
they
were
in
trouble
about
their
sister
once
outside
and
he
fled
immediately
he
wished
that
he
had
spoken
to
them
what
was
his
life
what
were
a
few
angry
words
or
even
imprisonment
he
had
done
wrong
that
was
the
true
terror
whatever
they
might
know
he
would
tell
them
everything
he
knew
he
paul
but
they
had
moved
in
his
absence
and
had
gone
to
lay
their
difficulties
before
wilcox
and
charles
the
sight
of
margaret
turned
remorse
into
new
channels
he
desired
to
confess
and
though
the
desire
is
proof
of
a
weakened
nature
which
is
about
to
lose
the
essence
of
human
intercourse
it
did
not
take
an
ignoble
form
he
did
not
suppose
that
confession
would
bring
him
happiness
it
was
rather
that
he
yearned
to
get
clear
of
the
tangle
so
does
the
suicide
yearn
the
impulses
are
akin
and
the
crime
of
suicide
lies
rather
in
its
disregard
for
the
feelings
of
those
whom
we
leave
behind
confession
need
harm
no
one
it
can
satisfy
that
test
and
though
it
was
and
ignored
by
our
anglican
cathedral
leonard
had
a
right
to
decide
upon
it
moreover
he
trusted
margaret
he
wanted
her
hardness
now
that
cold
intellectual
nature
of
hers
would
be
just
if
unkind
he
would
do
whatever
she
told
him
even
if
he
had
to
see
helen
that
was
the
supreme
punishment
she
would
exact
and
perhaps
she
would
tell
him
how
helen
was
that
was
the
supreme
reward
he
knew
nothing
about
margaret
not
even
whether
she
was
married
to
wilcox
and
tracking
her
out
took
several
days
that
evening
he
toiled
through
the
wet
to
wickham
place
where
the
new
flats
were
now
appearing
was
he
also
the
cause
of
their
move
were
they
expelled
from
society
on
his
account
thence
to
a
public
library
but
could
find
no
satisfactory
schlegel
in
the
directory
on
the
morrow
he
searched
again
he
hung
about
outside
wilcox
office
at
lunch
time
and
as
the
clerks
came
out
said
excuse
me
sir
but
is
your
boss
married
most
of
them
stared
some
said
what
that
to
you
but
one
who
had
not
yet
acquired
reticence
told
him
what
he
wished
leonard
could
not
learn
the
private
address
that
necessitated
more
trouble
with
directories
and
tubes
ducie
street
was
not
discovered
till
the
monday
the
day
that
margaret
and
her
husband
went
down
on
their
hunting
expedition
to
howards
end
he
called
at
about
four
the
weather
had
changed
and
the
sun
shone
gaily
on
the
ornamental
steps
black
and
white
marble
in
triangles
leonard
lowered
his
eyes
to
them
after
ringing
the
bell
he
felt
in
curious
health
doors
seemed
to
be
opening
and
shutting
inside
his
body
and
he
had
been
obliged
to
steep
sitting
up
in
bed
with
his
back
propped
against
the
wall
when
the
parlourmaid
came
he
could
not
see
her
face
the
brown
rain
had
descended
suddenly
does
wilcox
live
here
he
asked
she
out
was
the
answer
when
will
she
be
back
i
ask
said
the
parlourmaid
margaret
had
given
instructions
that
no
one
who
mentioned
her
name
should
ever
be
rebuffed
putting
the
door
on
the
chain
for
leonard
appearance
demanded
this
she
went
through
to
the
which
was
occupied
by
tibby
tibby
was
asleep
he
had
had
a
good
lunch
charles
wilcox
had
not
yet
rung
him
up
for
the
distracting
interview
he
said
drowsily
i
do
know
hilton
howards
end
who
is
it
i
ask
sir
no
do
bother
they
have
taken
the
car
to
howards
end
said
the
parlourmaid
to
leonard
he
thanked
her
and
asked
whereabouts
that
place
was
you
appear
to
want
to
know
a
good
deal
she
remarked
but
margaret
had
forbidden
her
to
be
mysterious
she
told
him
against
her
better
judgment
that
howards
end
was
in
hertfordshire
is
it
a
village
please
village
it
wilcox
private
house
at
least
it
one
of
them
wilcox
keeps
her
furniture
there
hilton
is
the
village
yes
and
when
will
they
be
back
schlegel
does
know
we
ca
know
everything
can
we
she
shut
him
out
and
went
to
attend
to
the
telephone
which
was
ringing
furiously
he
loitered
away
another
night
of
agony
confession
grew
more
difficult
as
soon
as
possible
he
went
to
bed
he
watched
a
patch
of
moonlight
cross
the
floor
of
their
lodging
and
as
sometimes
happens
when
the
mind
is
overtaxed
he
fell
asleep
for
the
rest
of
the
room
but
kept
awake
for
the
patch
of
moonlight
horrible
then
began
one
of
those
disintegrating
dialogues
part
of
him
said
why
horrible
it
ordinary
light
from
the
room
but
it
moves
so
does
the
moon
but
it
is
a
clenched
fist
why
not
but
it
is
going
to
touch
me
let
it
and
seeming
to
gather
motion
the
patch
ran
up
his
blanket
presently
a
blue
snake
appeared
then
another
parallel
to
it
is
there
life
in
the
moon
of
course
but
i
thought
it
was
uninhabited
not
by
time
death
judgment
and
the
smaller
snakes
smaller
snakes
said
leonard
indignantly
and
aloud
what
a
notion
by
a
rending
effort
of
the
will
he
woke
the
rest
of
the
room
up
jacky
the
bed
their
food
their
clothes
on
the
chair
gradually
entered
his
consciousness
and
the
horror
vanished
outwards
like
a
ring
that
is
spreading
through
water
i
say
jacky
i
going
out
for
a
bit
she
was
breathing
regularly
the
patch
of
light
fell
clear
of
the
striped
blanket
and
began
to
cover
the
shawl
that
lay
over
her
feet
why
had
he
been
afraid
he
went
to
the
window
and
saw
that
the
moon
was
descending
through
a
clear
sky
he
saw
her
volcanoes
and
the
bright
expanses
that
a
gracious
error
has
named
seas
they
paled
for
the
sun
who
had
lit
them
up
was
coming
to
light
the
earth
sea
of
serenity
sea
of
tranquillity
ocean
of
the
lunar
storms
merged
into
one
lucent
drop
itself
to
slip
into
the
sempiternal
dawn
and
he
had
been
afraid
of
the
moon
he
dressed
among
the
contending
lights
and
went
through
his
money
it
was
running
low
again
but
enough
for
a
return
ticket
to
hilton
as
it
clinked
jacky
opened
her
eyes
hullo
len
what
ho
len
what
ho
jacky
see
you
again
later
she
turned
over
and
slept
the
house
was
unlocked
their
landlord
being
a
salesman
at
convent
garden
leonard
passed
out
and
made
his
way
down
to
the
station
the
train
though
it
did
not
start
for
an
hour
was
already
drawn
up
at
the
end
of
the
platform
and
he
lay
down
in
it
and
slept
with
the
first
jolt
he
was
in
daylight
they
had
left
the
gateways
of
king
cross
and
were
under
blue
sky
tunnels
followed
and
after
each
the
sky
grew
bluer
and
from
the
embankment
at
finsbury
park
he
had
his
first
sight
of
the
sun
it
rolled
along
behind
the
eastern
smokes
a
wheel
whose
fellow
was
the
descending
moon
and
as
yet
it
seemed
the
servant
of
the
blue
sky
not
its
lord
he
dozed
again
over
tewin
water
it
was
day
to
the
left
fell
the
shadow
of
the
embankment
and
its
arches
to
the
right
leonard
saw
up
into
the
tewin
woods
and
towards
the
church
with
its
wild
legend
of
immortality
six
forest
trees
that
is
a
fact
grow
out
of
one
of
the
graves
in
tewin
churchyard
the
grave
occupant
that
is
the
legend
is
an
atheist
who
declared
that
if
god
existed
six
forest
trees
would
grow
out
of
her
grave
these
things
in
hertfordshire
and
farther
afield
lay
the
house
of
a
hermit
wilcox
had
known
him
who
barred
himself
up
and
wrote
prophecies
and
gave
all
he
had
to
the
poor
while
powdered
in
between
were
the
villas
of
business
men
who
saw
life
more
steadily
though
with
the
steadiness
of
the
eye
over
all
the
sun
was
streaming
to
all
the
birds
were
singing
to
all
the
primroses
were
yellow
and
the
speedwell
blue
and
the
country
however
they
interpreted
her
was
uttering
her
cry
of
now
she
did
not
free
leonard
yet
and
the
knife
plunged
deeper
into
his
heart
as
the
train
drew
up
at
hilton
but
remorse
had
become
beautiful
hilton
was
asleep
or
at
the
earliest
breakfasting
leonard
noticed
the
contrast
when
he
stepped
out
of
it
into
the
country
here
men
had
been
up
since
dawn
their
hours
were
ruled
not
by
a
london
office
but
by
the
movements
of
the
crops
and
the
sun
that
they
were
men
of
the
finest
type
only
the
sentimentalist
can
declare
but
they
kept
to
the
life
of
daylight
they
are
england
hope
clumsily
they
carry
forward
the
torch
of
the
sun
until
such
time
as
the
nation
sees
fit
to
take

up
half

half

they
can
still
throw
back
to
a
nobler
stock
and
breed
yeomen
at
the
chalk
pit
a
motor
passed
him
in
it
was
another
type
whom
nature
favours
the
imperial
healthy
ever
in
motion
it
hopes
to
inherit
the
earth
it
breeds
as
quickly
as
the
yeoman
and
as
soundly
strong
is
the
temptation
to
acclaim
it
as
a
who
carries
his
virtue
overseas
but
the
imperialist
is
not
what
he
thinks
or
seems
he
is
a
destroyer
he
prepares
the
way
for
cosmopolitanism
and
though
his
ambitions
may
be
fulfilled
the
earth
that
he
inherits
will
be
grey
to
leonard
intent
on
his
private
sin
there
came
the
conviction
of
innate
goodness
elsewhere
it
was
not
the
optimism
which
he
had
been
taught
at
school
again
and
again
must
the
drums
tap
and
the
goblins
stalk
over
the
universe
before
joy
can
be
purged
of
the
superficial
it
was
rather
paradoxical
and
arose
from
his
sorrow
death
destroys
a
man
but
the
idea
of
death
saves
him
that
is
the
best
account
of
it
that
has
yet
been
given
squalor
and
tragedy
can
beckon
to
all
that
is
great
in
us
and
strengthen
the
wings
of
love
they
can
beckon
it
is
not
certain
that
they
will
for
they
are
not
love
servants
but
they
can
beckon
and
the
knowledge
of
this
incredible
truth
comforted
him
as
he
approached
the
house
all
thought
stopped
contradictory
notions
stood
side
by
side
in
his
mind
he
was
terrified
but
happy
ashamed
but
had
done
no
sin
he
knew
the
confession
wilcox
i
have
done
wrong
but
sunrise
had
robbed
its
meaning
and
he
felt
rather
on
a
supreme
adventure
he
entered
a
garden
steadied
himself
against
a
that
he
found
in
it
found
a
door
open
and
entered
a
house
yes
it
would
be
very
easy
from
a
room
to
the
left
he
heard
voices
margaret
amongst
them
his
own
name
was
called
aloud
and
a
man
whom
he
had
never
seen
said
oh
is
he
there
i
am
not
surprised
i
now
thrash
him
within
an
inch
of
his
life
wilcox
said
leonard
i
have
done
wrong
the
man
took
him
by
the
collar
and
cried
bring
me
a
stick
women
were
screaming
a
stick
very
bright
descended
it
hurt
him
not
where
it
descended
but
in
the
heart
books
fell
over
him
in
a
shower
nothing
had
sense
get
some
water
commanded
charles
who
had
all
through
kept
very
calm
he
shamming
of
course
i
only
used
the
blade
here
carry
him
out
into
the
air
thinking
that
he
understood
these
things
margaret
obeyed
him
they
laid
leonard
who
was
dead
on
the
gravel
helen
poured
water
over
him
that
enough
said
charles
yes
murder
enough
said
miss
avery
coming
out
of
the
house
with
the
sword
chapter
when
charles
left
ducie
street
he
had
caught
the
first
train
home
but
had
no
inkling
of
the
newest
development
until
late
at
night
then
his
father
who
had
dined
alone
sent
for
him
and
in
very
grave
tones
inquired
for
margaret
i
do
know
where
she
is
pater
said
charles
dolly
kept
back
dinner
nearly
an
hour
for
her
tell
me
when
she
comes
in
another
hour
passed
the
servants
went
to
bed
and
charles
visited
his
father
again
to
receive
further
instructions
wilcox
had
still
not
returned
i
sit
up
for
her
as
late
as
you
like
but
she
can
hardly
be
coming
is
she
stopping
with
her
sister
at
the
hotel
perhaps
said
wilcox
thoughtfully
perhaps
can
i
do
anything
for
you
sir
not
tonight
my
boy
wilcox
liked
being
called
sir
he
raised
his
eyes
and
gave
his
son
more
open
a
look
of
tenderness
than
he
usually
ventured
he
saw
charles
as
little
boy
and
strong
man
in
one
though
his
wife
had
proved
unstable
his
children
were
left
to
him
after
midnight
he
tapped
on
charles
door
i
sleep
he
said
i
had
better
have
a
talk
with
you
and
get
it
over
he
complained
of
the
heat
charles
took
him
out
into
the
garden
and
they
paced
up
and
down
in
their
charles
became
very
quiet
as
the
story
unrolled
he
had
known
all
along
that
margaret
was
as
bad
as
her
sister
she
will
feel
differently
in
the
morning
said
wilcox
who
had
of
course
said
nothing
about
bast
but
i
can
not
let
this
kind
of
thing
continue
without
comment
i
am
morally
certain
that
she
is
with
her
sister
at
howards
end
the
house
is
mine
and
charles
it
will
be
yours
and
when
i
say
that
no
one
is
to
live
there
i
mean
that
no
one
is
to
live
there
i
wo
have
it
he
looked
angrily
at
the
moon
to
my
mind
this
question
is
connected
with
something
far
greater
the
rights
of
property
itself
undoubtedly
said
charles
wilcox
linked
his
arm
in
his
son
but
somehow
liked
him
less
as
he
told
him
more
i
do
want
you
to
conclude
that
my
wife
and
i
had
anything
of
the
nature
of
a
quarrel
she
was
only
as
who
would
not
be
i
shall
do
what
i
can
for
helen
but
on
the
understanding
that
they
clear
out
of
the
house
at
once
do
you
see
that
is
a
sine
qua
non
then
at
eight
tomorrow
i
may
go
up
in
the
car
eight
or
earlier
say
that
you
are
acting
as
my
representative
and
of
course
use
no
violence
charles
on
the
morrow
as
charles
returned
leaving
leonard
dead
upon
the
gravel
it
did
not
seem
to
him
that
he
had
used
violence
death
was
due
to
heart
disease
his
stepmother
herself
had
said
so
and
even
miss
avery
had
acknowledged
that
he
only
used
the
flat
of
the
sword
on
his
way
through
the
village
he
informed
the
police
who
thanked
him
and
said
there
must
be
an
inquest
he
found
his
father
in
the
garden
shading
his
eyes
from
the
sun
it
has
been
pretty
horrible
said
charles
gravely
they
were
there
and
they
had
the
man
up
there
with
them
too
what
what
man
i
told
you
last
night
his
name
was
bast
my
god
is
it
possible
said
wilcox
in
your
mother
house
charles
in
your
mother
house
i
know
pater
that
was
what
i
felt
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
no
need
to
trouble
about
the
man
he
was
in
the
last
stages
of
heart
disease
and
just
before
i
could
show
him
what
i
thought
of
him
he
went
off
the
police
are
seeing
about
it
at
this
moment
wilcox
listened
attentively
i
got
up
there
oh
it
could
have
been
more
than
seven
the
avery
woman
was
lighting
a
fire
for
them
they
were
still
upstairs
i
waited
in
the
we
were
all
moderately
civil
and
collected
though
i
had
my
suspicions
i
gave
them
your
message
and
wilcox
said
yes
i
see
yes
in
that
way
of
hers
nothing
else
i
promised
to
tell
you
her
love
that
she
was
going
to
germany
with
her
sister
this
evening
that
was
all
we
had
time
for
wilcox
seemed
relieved
because
by
then
i
suppose
the
man
got
tired
of
hiding
for
suddenly
wilcox
screamed
out
his
name
i
recognized
it
and
i
went
for
him
in
the
hall
was
i
right
pater
i
thought
things
were
going
a
little
too
far
right
my
dear
boy
i
do
know
but
you
would
have
been
no
son
of
mine
if
you
had
then
did
he
just
just
crumple
up
as
you
said
he
shrunk
from
the
simple
word
he
caught
hold
of
the
bookcase
which
came
down
over
him
so
i
merely
put
the
sword
down
and
carried
him
into
the
garden
we
all
thought
he
was
shamming
however
dead
right
enough
awful
business
sword
cried
his
father
with
anxiety
in
his
voice
what
sword
whose
sword
a
sword
of
theirs
what
were
you
doing
with
it
well
did
you
see
pater
i
had
to
snatch
up
the
first
thing
handy
i
had
a
or
stick
i
caught
him
once
or
twice
over
the
shoulders
with
the
flat
of
their
old
german
sword
then
what
he
pulled
over
the
bookcase
as
i
said
and
fell
said
charles
with
a
sigh
it
was
no
fun
doing
errands
for
his
father
who
was
never
quite
satisfied
but
the
real
cause
was
heart
disease
of
that
you
sure
that
or
a
fit
however
we
shall
hear
more
than
enough
at
the
inquest
on
such
unsavoury
topics
they
went
into
breakfast
charles
had
a
racking
headache
consequent
on
motoring
before
food
he
was
also
anxious
about
the
future
reflecting
that
the
police
must
detain
helen
and
margaret
for
the
inquest
and
ferret
the
whole
thing
out
he
saw
himself
obliged
to
leave
hilton
one
could
not
afford
to
live
near
the
scene
of
a
scandal
it
was
not
fair
on
one
wife
his
comfort
was
that
the
pater
eyes
were
opened
at
last
there
would
be
a
horrible
smash
up
and
probably
a
separation
from
margaret
then
they
would
all
start
again
more
as
they
had
been
in
his
time
i
think
i
go
round
to
the
said
his
father
when
breakfast
was
over
what
for
cried
dolly
who
had
still
not
been
told
very
well
sir
which
car
will
you
have
i
think
i
walk
it
a
good
said
charles
stepping
into
the
garden
the
sun
very
hot
for
april
sha
i
take
you
up
and
then
perhaps
a
little
spin
round
by
tewin
you
go
on
as
if
i
did
know
my
own
mind
said
wilcox
fretfully
charles
hardened
his
mouth
you
young
fellows
one
idea
is
to
get
into
a
motor
i
tell
you
i
want
to
walk
i
very
fond
of
walking
oh
all
right
i
about
the
house
if
you
want
me
for
anything
i
thought
of
not
going
up
to
the
office
today
if
that
is
your
wish
it
is
indeed
my
boy
said
wilcox
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
sleeve
charles
did
not
like
it
he
was
uneasy
about
his
father
who
did
not
seem
himself
this
morning
there
was
a
petulant
touch
about
him
more
like
a
woman
could
it
be
that
he
was
growing
old
the
wilcoxes
were
not
lacking
in
affection
they
had
it
royally
but
they
did
not
know
how
to
use
it
it
was
the
talent
in
the
napkin
and
for
a
man
charles
had
conveyed
very
little
joy
as
he
watched
his
father
shuffling
up
the
road
he
had
a
vague
regret
a
wish
that
something
had
been
different
somewhere
a
wish
though
he
did
not
express
it
thus
that
he
had
been
taught
to
say
i
in
his
youth
he
meant
to
make
up
for
defection
but
knew
that
his
father
had
been
very
happy
with
her
until
yesterday
how
had
she
done
it
by
some
dishonest
trick
no
doubt
but
how
wilcox
reappeared
at
eleven
looking
very
tired
there
was
to
be
an
inquest
on
leonard
body
tomorrow
and
the
police
required
his
son
to
attend
i
expected
that
said
charles
i
shall
naturally
be
the
most
important
witness
there
chapter
out
of
the
turmoil
and
horror
that
had
begun
with
aunt
juley
illness
and
was
not
even
to
end
with
death
it
seemed
impossible
to
margaret
that
healthy
life
should
events
succeeded
in
a
logical
yet
senseless
train
people
lost
their
humanity
and
took
values
as
arbitrary
as
those
in
a
pack
of
it
was
natural
that
henry
should
do
this
and
cause
helen
to
do
that
and
then
think
her
wrong
for
doing
it
natural
that
she
herself
should
think
him
wrong
natural
that
leonard
should
want
to
know
how
helen
was
and
come
and
charles
be
angry
with
him
for
coming
natural
but
unreal
in
this
jangle
of
causes
and
effects
what
had
become
of
their
true
selves
here
leonard
lay
dead
in
the
garden
from
natural
causes
yet
life
was
a
deep
deep
river
death
a
blue
sky
life
was
a
house
death
a
wisp
of
hay
a
flower
a
tower
life
and
death
were
anything
and
everything
except
this
ordered
insanity
where
the
king
takes
the
queen
and
the
ace
the
king
ah
no
there
was
beauty
and
adventure
behind
such
as
the
man
at
her
feet
had
yearned
for
there
was
hope
this
side
of
the
grave
there
were
truer
relationships
beyond
the
limits
that
fetter
us
now
as
a
prisoner
looks
up
and
sees
stars
beckoning
so
she
from
the
turmoil
and
horror
of
those
days
caught
glimpses
of
the
diviner
wheels
and
helen
dumb
with
fright
but
trying
to
keep
calm
for
the
child
sake
and
miss
avery
calm
but
murmuring
tenderly
no
one
ever
told
the
lad
he
have
a
child
they
also
reminded
her
that
horror
is
not
the
end
to
what
ultimate
harmony
we
tend
she
did
not
know
but
there
seemed
great
chance
that
a
child
would
be
born
into
the
world
to
take
the
great
chances
of
beauty
and
adventure
that
the
world
offers
she
moved
through
the
sunlit
garden
gathering
narcissi
and
white
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
the
time
for
telegrams
and
anger
was
over
and
it
seemed
wisest
that
the
hands
of
leonard
should
be
folded
on
his
breast
and
be
filled
with
flowers
here
was
the
father
leave
it
at
that
let
squalor
be
turned
into
tragedy
whose
eyes
are
the
stars
and
whose
hands
hold
the
sunset
and
the
dawn
and
even
the
influx
of
officials
even
the
return
of
the
doctor
vulgar
and
acute
could
not
shake
her
belief
in
the
eternity
of
beauty
science
explained
people
but
could
not
understand
them
after
long
centuries
among
the
bones
and
muscles
it
might
be
advancing
to
knowledge
of
the
nerves
but
this
would
never
give
understanding
one
could
open
the
heart
to
mansbridge
and
his
sort
without
discovering
its
secrets
to
them
for
they
wanted
everything
down
in
black
and
white
and
black
and
white
was
exactly
what
they
were
left
with
they
questioned
her
closely
about
charles
she
never
suspected
why
death
had
come
and
the
doctor
agreed
that
it
was
due
to
heart
disease
they
asked
to
see
her
sword
she
explained
that
charles
anger
was
natural
but
mistaken
miserable
questions
about
leonard
followed
all
of
which
she
answered
unfalteringly
then
back
to
charles
again
no
doubt
wilcox
may
have
induced
death
she
said
but
if
it
was
one
thing
it
would
have
been
another
as
you
yourselves
know
at
last
they
thanked
her
and
took
the
sword
and
the
body
down
to
hilton
she
began
to
pick
up
the
books
from
the
floor
helen
had
gone
to
the
farm
it
was
the
best
place
for
her
since
she
had
to
wait
for
the
inquest
though
as
if
things
were
not
hard
enough
madge
and
her
husband
had
raised
trouble
they
did
not
see
why
they
should
receive
the
offscourings
of
howards
end
and
of
course
they
were
right
the
whole
world
was
going
to
be
right
and
amply
avenge
any
brave
talk
against
the
conventions
nothing
matters
the
schlegels
had
said
in
the
past
except
and
that
of
one
friends
when
the
time
came
other
things
mattered
terribly
however
madge
had
yielded
and
helen
was
assured
of
peace
for
one
day
and
night
and
tomorrow
she
would
return
to
germany
as
for
herself
she
determined
to
go
too
no
message
came
from
henry
perhaps
he
expected
her
to
apologize
now
that
she
had
time
to
think
over
her
own
tragedy
she
was
unrepentant
she
neither
forgave
him
for
his
behaviour
nor
wished
to
forgive
him
her
speech
to
him
seemed
perfect
she
would
not
have
altered
a
word
it
had
to
be
uttered
once
in
a
life
to
adjust
the
lopsidedness
of
the
world
it
was
spoken
not
only
to
her
husband
but
to
thousands
of
men
like
him
a
protest
against
the
inner
darkness
in
high
places
that
comes
with
a
commercial
age
though
he
would
build
up
his
life
without
hers
she
could
not
apologize
he
had
refused
to
connect
on
the
clearest
issue
that
can
be
laid
before
a
man
and
their
love
must
take
the
consequences
no
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
they
had
tried
not
to
go
over
the
precipice
but
perhaps
the
fall
was
inevitable
and
it
comforted
her
to
think
that
the
future
was
certainly
inevitable
cause
and
effect
would
go
jangling
forward
to
some
goal
doubtless
but
to
none
that
she
could
imagine
at
such
moments
the
soul
retires
within
to
float
upon
the
bosom
of
a
deeper
stream
and
has
communion
with
the
dead
and
sees
the
world
glory
not
diminished
but
different
in
kind
to
what
she
has
supposed
she
alters
her
focus
until
trivial
things
are
blurred
margaret
had
been
tending
this
way
all
the
winter
leonard
death
brought
her
to
the
goal
alas
that
henry
should
fade
away
as
reality
emerged
and
only
her
love
for
him
should
remain
clear
stamped
with
his
image
like
the
cameos
we
rescue
out
of
dreams
with
unfaltering
eye
she
traced
his
future
he
would
soon
present
a
healthy
mind
to
the
world
again
and
what
did
he
or
the
world
care
if
he
was
rotten
at
the
core
he
would
grow
into
a
rich
jolly
old
man
at
times
a
little
sentimental
about
women
but
emptying
his
glass
with
anyone
tenacious
of
power
he
would
keep
charles
and
the
rest
dependent
and
retire
from
business
reluctantly
and
at
an
advanced
age
he
would
settle
down
though
she
could
not
realize
this
in
her
eyes
henry
was
always
moving
and
causing
others
to
move
until
the
ends
of
the
earth
met
but
in
time
he
must
get
too
tired
to
move
and
settle
down
what
next
the
inevitable
word
the
release
of
the
soul
to
its
appropriate
heaven
would
they
meet
in
it
margaret
believed
in
immortality
for
herself
an
eternal
future
had
always
seemed
natural
to
her
and
henry
believed
in
it
for
himself
yet
would
they
meet
again
are
there
not
rather
endless
levels
beyond
the
grave
as
the
theory
that
he
had
censured
teaches
and
his
level
whether
higher
or
lower
could
it
possibly
be
the
same
as
hers
thus
gravely
meditating
she
was
summoned
by
him
he
sent
up
crane
in
the
motor
other
servants
passed
like
water
but
the
chauffeur
remained
though
impertinent
and
disloyal
margaret
disliked
crane
and
he
knew
it
is
it
the
keys
that
wilcox
wants
she
asked
he
did
say
madam
you
have
any
note
for
me
he
did
say
madam
after
a
moment
thought
she
locked
up
howards
end
it
was
pitiable
to
see
in
it
the
stirrings
of
warmth
that
would
be
quenched
for
ever
she
raked
out
the
fire
that
was
blazing
in
the
kitchen
and
spread
the
coals
in
the
gravelled
yard
she
closed
the
windows
and
drew
the
curtains
henry
would
probably
sell
the
place
now
she
was
determined
not
to
spare
him
for
nothing
new
had
happened
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
her
mood
might
never
have
altered
from
yesterday
evening
he
was
standing
a
little
outside
charles
gate
and
motioned
the
car
to
stop
when
his
wife
got
out
he
said
hoarsely
i
prefer
to
discuss
things
with
you
outside
it
will
be
more
appropriate
in
the
road
i
am
afraid
said
margaret
did
you
get
my
message
what
about
i
am
going
to
germany
with
my
sister
i
must
tell
you
now
that
i
shall
make
it
my
permanent
home
our
talk
last
night
was
more
important
than
you
have
realized
i
am
unable
to
forgive
you
and
am
leaving
you
i
am
extremely
tired
said
henry
in
injured
tones
i
have
been
walking
about
all
the
morning
and
wish
to
sit
down
certainly
if
you
will
consent
to
sit
on
the
grass
the
great
north
road
should
have
been
bordered
all
its
length
with
glebe
henry
kind
had
filched
most
of
it
she
moved
to
the
scrap
opposite
wherein
were
the
six
hills
they
sat
down
on
the
farther
side
so
that
they
could
not
be
seen
by
charles
or
dolly
here
are
your
keys
said
margaret
she
tossed
them
towards
him
they
fell
on
the
sunlit
slope
of
grass
and
he
did
not
pick
them
up
i
have
something
to
tell
you
he
said
gently
she
knew
this
superficial
gentleness
this
confession
of
hastiness
that
was
only
intended
to
enhance
her
admiration
of
the
male
i
do
want
to
hear
it
she
replied
my
sister
is
going
to
be
my
life
is
going
to
be
with
her
now
we
must
manage
to
build
up
something
she
and
i
and
her
child
where
are
you
going
munich
we
start
after
the
inquest
if
she
is
not
too
after
the
inquest
yes
have
you
realized
what
the
verdict
at
the
inquest
will
be
yes
heart
disease
no
my
dear
manslaughter
margaret
drove
her
fingers
through
the
grass
the
hill
beneath
her
moved
as
if
it
was
alive
manslaughter
repeated
wilcox
charles
may
go
to
prison
i
dare
not
tell
him
i
do
know
what
to
do
what
to
do
i
broken
i
no
sudden
warmth
arose
in
her
she
did
not
see
that
to
break
him
was
her
only
hope
she
did
not
enfold
the
sufferer
in
her
arms
but
all
through
that
day
and
the
next
a
new
life
began
to
move
the
verdict
was
brought
in
charles
was
committed
for
trial
it
was
against
all
reason
that
he
should
be
punished
but
the
law
being
made
in
his
image
sentenced
him
to
three
years
imprisonment
then
henry
fortress
gave
way
he
could
bear
no
one
but
his
wife
he
shambled
up
to
margaret
afterwards
and
asked
her
to
do
what
she
could
with
him
she
did
what
seemed
easiest
she
took
him
down
to
recruit
at
howards
end
chapter
tom
father
was
cutting
the
big
meadow
he
passed
again
and
again
amid
whirring
blades
and
sweet
odours
of
grass
encompassing
with
narrowing
circles
the
sacred
centre
of
the
field
tom
was
negotiating
with
helen
i
have
any
idea
she
replied
do
you
suppose
baby
may
meg
margaret
put
down
her
work
and
regarded
them
absently
what
was
that
she
asked
tom
wants
to
know
whether
baby
is
old
enough
to
play
with
hay
i
have
the
least
notion
answered
margaret
and
took
up
her
work
again
now
tom
baby
is
not
to
stand
he
is
not
to
lie
on
his
face
he
is
not
to
lie
so
that
his
head
wags
he
is
not
to
be
teased
or
tickled
and
he
is
not
to
be
cut
into
two
or
more
pieces
by
the
cutter
will
you
be
as
careful
as
all
that
tom
held
out
his
arms
that
child
is
a
wonderful
nursemaid
remarked
margaret
he
is
fond
of
baby
that
why
he
does
it
was
helen
answer
they
going
to
be
lifelong
friends
starting
at
the
ages
of
six
and
one
of
course
it
will
be
a
great
thing
for
tom
it
may
be
a
greater
thing
for
baby
fourteen
months
had
passed
but
margaret
still
stopped
at
howards
end
no
better
plan
had
occurred
to
her
the
meadow
was
being
recut
the
great
red
poppies
were
reopening
in
the
garden
july
would
follow
with
the
little
red
poppies
among
the
wheat
august
with
the
cutting
of
the
wheat
these
little
events
would
become
part
of
her
year
after
year
every
summer
she
would
fear
lest
the
well
should
give
out
every
winter
lest
the
pipes
should
freeze
every
westerly
gale
might
blow
the
down
and
bring
the
end
of
all
things
and
so
she
could
not
read
or
talk
during
a
westerly
gale
the
air
was
tranquil
now
she
and
her
sister
were
sitting
on
the
remains
of
evie
mockery
where
the
lawn
merged
into
the
field
what
a
time
they
all
are
said
helen
what
can
they
be
doing
inside
margaret
who
was
growing
less
talkative
made
no
answer
the
noise
of
the
cutter
came
intermittently
like
the
breaking
of
waves
close
by
them
a
man
was
preparing
to
scythe
out
one
of
the
i
wish
henry
was
out
to
enjoy
this
said
helen
this
lovely
weather
and
to
be
shut
up
in
the
house
it
very
hard
it
has
to
be
said
margaret
the
is
his
chief
objection
against
living
here
but
he
thinks
it
worth
while
meg
is
or
is
he
ill
i
ca
make
out
not
eternally
tired
he
has
worked
very
hard
all
his
life
and
noticed
nothing
those
are
the
people
who
collapse
when
they
do
notice
a
thing
i
suppose
he
worries
dreadfully
about
his
part
of
the
tangle
dreadfully
that
is
why
i
wish
dolly
had
not
come
too
today
still
he
wanted
them
all
to
come
it
has
to
be
why
does
he
want
them
margaret
did
not
answer
meg
may
i
tell
you
something
i
like
henry
you
be
odd
if
you
did
said
margaret
i
use
to
use
she
lowered
her
eyes
a
moment
to
the
black
abyss
of
the
past
they
had
crossed
it
always
excepting
leonard
and
charles
they
were
building
up
a
new
life
obscure
yet
gilded
with
tranquillity
leonard
was
dead
charles
had
two
years
more
in
prison
one
use
always
to
see
clearly
before
that
time
it
was
different
now
i
like
henry
because
he
does
worry
and
he
likes
you
because
you
do
helen
sighed
she
seemed
humiliated
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
after
a
time
she
said
above
love
a
transition
less
abrupt
than
it
appeared
margaret
never
stopped
working
i
mean
a
woman
love
for
a
man
i
supposed
i
should
hang
my
life
on
to
that
once
and
was
driven
up
and
down
and
about
as
if
something
was
worrying
through
me
but
everything
is
peaceful
now
i
seem
cured
that
herr
forstmeister
whom
frieda
keeps
writing
about
must
be
a
noble
character
but
he
does
see
that
i
shall
never
marry
him
or
anyone
it
is
shame
or
mistrust
of
myself
i
simply
could
i
ended
i
used
to
be
so
dreamy
about
a
man
love
as
a
girl
and
think
that
for
good
or
evil
love
must
be
the
great
thing
but
it
has
been
it
has
been
itself
a
dream
do
you
agree
i
do
not
agree
i
do
not
i
ought
to
remember
leonard
as
my
lover
said
helen
stepping
down
into
the
field
i
tempted
him
and
killed
him
and
it
is
surely
the
least
i
can
do
i
would
like
to
throw
out
all
my
heart
to
leonard
on
such
an
afternoon
as
this
but
i
can
not
it
is
no
good
pretending
i
am
forgetting
him
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
how
nothing
seems
to
match
how
my
darling
my
precious
she
broke
off
tommy
yes
please
baby
not
to
try
and
there
something
wanting
in
me
i
see
you
loving
henry
and
understanding
him
better
daily
and
i
know
that
death
would
part
you
in
the
least
but
i
is
it
some
awful
appalling
criminal
defect
margaret
silenced
her
she
said
it
is
only
that
people
are
far
more
different
than
is
pretended
all
over
the
world
men
and
women
are
worrying
because
they
can
not
develop
as
they
are
supposed
to
develop
here
and
there
they
have
the
matter
out
and
it
comforts
them
do
fret
yourself
helen
develop
what
you
have
love
your
child
i
do
not
love
children
i
am
thankful
to
have
none
i
can
play
with
their
beauty
and
charm
but
that
is
all
nothing
real
not
one
scrap
of
what
there
ought
to
be
and
others
others
go
farther
still
and
move
outside
humanity
altogether
a
place
as
well
as
a
person
may
catch
the
glow
do
you
see
that
all
this
leads
to
comfort
in
the
end
it
is
part
of
the
battle
against
sameness
differences
eternal
differences
planted
by
god
in
a
single
family
so
that
there
may
always
be
colour
sorrow
perhaps
but
colour
in
the
daily
grey
then
i
ca
have
you
worrying
about
leonard
do
drag
in
the
personal
when
it
will
not
come
forget
him
yes
yes
but
what
has
leonard
got
out
of
life
perhaps
an
adventure
is
that
enough
not
for
us
but
for
him
helen
took
up
a
bunch
of
grass
she
looked
at
the
sorrel
and
the
red
and
white
and
yellow
clover
and
the
quaker
grass
and
the
daisies
and
the
bents
that
composed
it
she
raised
it
to
her
face
is
it
sweetening
yet
asked
margaret
no
only
withered
it
will
sweeten
tomorrow
helen
smiled
oh
meg
you
are
a
person
she
said
think
of
the
racket
and
torture
this
time
last
year
but
now
i
could
stop
unhappy
if
i
tried
what
a
change
and
all
through
you
oh
we
merely
settled
down
you
and
henry
learnt
to
understand
one
another
and
to
forgive
all
through
the
autumn
and
the
winter
yes
but
who
settled
us
down
margaret
did
not
reply
the
scything
had
begun
and
she
took
off
her
to
watch
it
you
cried
helen
you
did
it
all
sweetest
though
you
too
stupid
to
see
living
here
was
your
plan
i
wanted
you
he
wanted
you
and
every
one
said
it
was
impossible
but
you
knew
just
think
of
our
lives
without
you
meg
i
and
baby
with
monica
revolting
by
theory
he
handed
about
from
dolly
to
evie
but
you
picked
up
the
pieces
and
made
us
a
home
ca
it
strike
you
even
for
a
moment
that
your
life
has
been
heroic
ca
you
remember
the
two
months
after
charles
arrest
when
you
began
to
act
and
did
all
you
were
both
ill
at
the
time
said
margaret
i
did
the
obvious
things
i
had
two
invalids
to
nurse
here
was
a
house
ready
furnished
and
empty
it
was
obvious
i
did
know
myself
it
would
turn
into
a
permanent
home
no
doubt
i
have
done
a
little
towards
straightening
the
tangle
but
things
that
i
ca
phrase
have
helped
me
i
hope
it
will
be
permanent
said
helen
drifting
away
to
other
thoughts
i
think
so
there
are
moments
when
i
feel
howards
end
peculiarly
our
own
all
the
same
london
creeping
she
pointed
over
the
meadow
over
eight
or
nine
meadows
but
at
the
end
of
them
was
a
red
rust
you
see
that
in
surrey
and
even
hampshire
now
she
continued
i
can
see
it
from
the
purbeck
downs
and
london
is
only
part
of
something
else
i
afraid
going
to
be
melted
down
all
over
the
world
margaret
knew
that
her
sister
spoke
truly
howards
end
oniton
the
purbeck
downs
the
oderberge
were
all
survivals
and
the
was
being
prepared
for
them
logically
they
had
no
right
to
be
alive
one
hope
was
in
the
weakness
of
logic
were
they
possibly
the
earth
beating
time
because
a
thing
is
going
strong
now
it
need
not
go
strong
for
ever
she
said
this
craze
for
motion
has
only
set
in
during
the
last
hundred
years
it
may
be
followed
by
a
civilization
that
wo
be
a
movement
because
it
will
rest
on
the
earth
all
the
signs
are
against
it
now
but
i
ca
help
hoping
and
very
early
in
the
morning
in
the
garden
i
feel
that
our
house
is
the
future
as
well
as
the
past
they
turned
and
looked
at
it
their
own
memories
coloured
it
now
for
helen
child
had
been
born
in
the
central
room
of
the
nine
then
margaret
said
oh
take
care
for
something
moved
behind
the
window
of
the
hall
and
the
door
opened
the
conclave
breaking
at
last
i
go
it
was
paul
helen
retreated
with
the
children
far
into
the
field
friendly
voices
greeted
her
margaret
rose
to
encounter
a
man
with
a
heavy
black
moustache
my
father
has
asked
for
you
he
said
with
hostility
she
took
her
work
and
followed
him
we
have
been
talking
business
he
continued
but
i
dare
say
you
knew
all
about
it
beforehand
yes
i
did
clumsy
of
movement
for
he
had
spent
all
his
life
in
the
saddle
paul
drove
his
foot
against
the
paint
of
the
front
door
wilcox
gave
a
little
cry
of
annoyance
she
did
not
like
anything
scratched
she
stopped
in
the
hall
to
take
dolly
boa
and
gloves
out
of
a
vase
her
husband
was
lying
in
a
great
leather
chair
in
the
and
by
his
side
holding
his
hand
rather
ostentatiously
was
evie
dolly
dressed
in
purple
sat
near
the
window
the
room
was
a
little
dark
and
airless
they
were
obliged
to
keep
it
like
this
until
the
carting
of
the
hay
margaret
joined
the
family
without
speaking
the
five
of
them
had
met
already
at
tea
and
she
knew
quite
well
what
was
going
to
be
said
averse
to
wasting
her
time
she
went
on
sewing
the
clock
struck
six
is
this
going
to
suit
every
one
said
henry
in
a
weary
voice
he
used
the
old
phrases
but
their
effect
was
unexpected
and
shadowy
because
i
do
want
you
all
coming
here
later
on
and
complaining
that
i
have
been
unfair
it
apparently
got
to
suit
us
said
paul
i
beg
your
pardon
my
boy
you
have
only
to
speak
and
i
will
leave
the
house
to
you
instead
paul
frowned
and
began
scratching
at
his
arm
as
i
given
up
the
outdoor
life
that
suited
me
and
i
have
come
home
to
look
after
the
business
it
no
good
my
settling
down
here
he
said
at
last
it
not
really
the
country
and
it
not
the
town
very
well
does
my
arrangement
suit
you
evie
of
course
father
and
you
dolly
dolly
raised
her
faded
little
face
which
sorrow
could
wither
but
not
steady
perfectly
splendidly
she
said
i
thought
charles
wanted
it
for
the
boys
but
last
time
i
saw
him
he
said
no
because
we
can
not
possibly
live
in
this
part
of
england
again
charles
says
we
ought
to
change
our
name
but
i
can
not
think
what
to
for
wilcox
just
suits
charles
and
me
and
i
ca
think
of
any
other
name
there
was
a
general
silence
dolly
looked
nervously
round
fearing
that
she
had
been
inappropriate
paul
continued
to
scratch
his
arm
then
i
leave
howards
end
to
my
wife
absolutely
said
henry
and
let
every
one
understand
that
and
after
i
am
dead
let
there
be
no
jealousy
and
no
surprise
margaret
did
not
answer
there
was
something
uncanny
in
her
triumph
she
who
had
never
expected
to
conquer
anyone
had
charged
straight
through
these
wilcoxes
and
broken
up
their
lives
in
consequence
i
leave
my
wife
no
money
said
henry
that
is
her
own
wish
all
that
she
would
have
had
will
be
divided
among
you
i
am
also
giving
you
a
great
deal
in
my
lifetime
so
that
you
may
be
independent
of
me
that
is
her
wish
too
she
also
is
giving
away
a
great
deal
of
money
she
intends
to
diminish
her
income
by
half
during
the
next
ten
years
she
intends
when
she
dies
to
leave
the
house
to
her
to
her
nephew
down
in
the
field
is
all
that
clear
does
every
one
understand
paul
rose
to
his
feet
he
was
accustomed
to
natives
and
a
very
little
shook
him
out
of
the
englishman
feeling
manly
and
cynical
he
said
down
in
the
field
oh
come
i
think
we
might
have
had
the
whole
establishment
piccaninnies
included
cahill
whispered
do
paul
you
promised
take
care
feeling
a
woman
of
the
world
she
rose
and
prepared
to
take
her
leave
her
father
kissed
her
old
girl
he
said
do
you
worry
about
dad
then
it
was
dolly
turn
anxious
to
contribute
she
laughed
nervously
and
said
wilcox
it
does
seem
curious
that
wilcox
should
have
left
margaret
howards
end
and
yet
she
get
it
after
all
from
evie
came
a
breath
she
said
to
margaret
and
kissed
her
and
again
and
again
fell
the
word
like
the
ebb
of
a
dying
sea
dolly
so
long
father
my
boy
always
take
care
of
yourself
mrs
wilcox
margaret
saw
their
visitors
to
the
gate
then
she
returned
to
her
husband
and
laid
her
head
in
his
hands
he
was
pitiably
tired
but
dolly
remark
had
interested
her
at
last
she
said
could
you
tell
me
henry
what
was
that
about
wilcox
having
left
me
howards
end
tranquilly
he
replied
yes
she
did
but
that
is
a
very
old
story
when
she
was
ill
and
you
were
so
kind
to
her
she
wanted
to
make
you
some
return
and
not
being
herself
at
the
time
scribbled
end
on
a
piece
of
paper
i
went
into
it
thoroughly
and
as
it
was
clearly
fanciful
i
set
it
aside
little
knowing
what
my
margaret
would
be
to
me
in
the
future
margaret
was
silent
something
shook
her
life
in
its
inmost
recesses
and
she
shivered
i
did
do
wrong
did
i
he
asked
bending
down
you
did
darling
nothing
has
been
done
wrong
from
the
garden
came
laughter
here
they
are
at
last
exclaimed
henry
disengaging
himself
with
a
smile
helen
rushed
into
the
gloom
holding
tom
by
one
hand
and
carrying
her
baby
on
the
other
there
were
shouts
of
infectious
joy
the
field
cut
helen
cried
excitedly
the
big
meadow
we
seen
to
the
very
end
and
it
be
such
a
crop
of
hay
as
never
