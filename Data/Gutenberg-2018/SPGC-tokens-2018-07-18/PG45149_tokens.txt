preface
iii
among
the
numerous
sects
and
churches
of
the
present
day
the
saints
are
distinguished
as
builders
of
temples
in
this
respect
they
resemble
israel
of
olden
time
it
is
not
surprising
that
great
and
widespread
interest
is
manifest
respecting
this
peculiarity
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
nor
that
questions
are
continually
arising
as
to
the
purpose
and
motive
behind
this
great
labor
and
the
nature
of
the
ordinances
administered
in
these
modern
houses
of
the
lord
to
answer
some
of
these
questions
and
to
place
within
the
reach
of
earnest
inquirers
authentic
information
concerning
the
doctrine
and
practise
of
temple
ministration
this
book
has
been
written
by
way
of
affording
means
of
easy
comparison
between
the
achievements
of
past
and
those
of
current
time
a
brief
treatment
of
the
sanctuaries
of
earlier
dispensations
has
been
included
while
detailed
information
pertaining
to
ancient
temples
and
related
sanctuaries
is
accessible
to
all
through
cyclopedias
bible
dictionaries
and
works
of
more
special
scope
but
little
concerning
the
temples
of
today
and
the
sacred
service
therein
rendered
has
been
published
in
separate
form
the
official
history
of
the
church
of

contains
abundant
data
on
the

but
the

is
distributed

chapter
i
a
of
the
subject
both
by
derivation
and
common
usage
the
term
temple
in
its
literal
application
is
of
restricted
and
specific
meaning
the
essential
idea
of
a
temple
is
and
ever
has
been
that
of
a
specially
set
apart
for
service
regarded
as
sacred
and
of
real
or
assumed
sanctity
in
a
more
restricted
sense
a
temple
is
a
constructed
for
and
exclusively
devoted
to
sacred
rites
and
ceremonies
the
latin
was
the
equivalent
of
the
hebrew
and
signified
the
abode
of
deity
hence
as
associated
with
divine
worship
it
meant
literally
the
house
of
the
lord
structures
regarded
in
their
entirety
as
sanctuaries
or
enclosing
apartments
so
designated
have
been
reared
in
many
different
ages
both
by
worshippers
of
idols
and
by
the
followers
of
the
true
and
living
god
heathen
temples
of
antiquity
were
regarded
as
abiding
places
of
the
mythical
gods
and
goddesses
whose
names
they
bore
and
to
whose
service
the
structures
were
dedicated
while
the
purlieus
of
such
temples
were
used
as
places
of
general
assembly
and
public
ceremony
there
were
always
inner
precincts
into
which
only
the
consecrated
priests
might
enter
and
wherein
it
was
claimed
the
presence
of
the
deity
was
manifest
as
evidence
of
the
exclusiveness
of
ancient
temples
even
those
of
heathen
origin
we
find
that
the
altar
of
pagan
worship
stood
not
within
the
temple
proper
but
in
front
of
the
entrance
temples
have
never
been
regarded
as
places
of
ordinary
public
assembly
but
as
sacred
enclosures
consecrated
to
the
most
solemn
ceremonials
of
that
particular
system
of
worship
idolatrous
or
divine
of
which
the
temple
stood
as
visible
symbol
and
material
type
in
olden
times
the
people
of
israel
were
distinguished
among
nations
as
the
builders
of
sanctuaries
to
the
name
of
the
living
god
this
service
was
specifically
required
of
them
by
jehovah
whom
they
professed
to
serve
the
history
of
israel
as
a
nation
dates
from
the
exodus
during
the
two
centuries
of
their
enslavement
in
egypt
the
children
of
jacob
had
grown
to
be
a
numerous
and
powerful
people
nevertheless
they
were
in
bondage
in
due
time
however
their
sorrows
and
supplications
came
up
before
the
lord
and
he
led
them
forth
by
the
outstretched
arm
of
power
no
sooner
had
they
escaped
from
the
environment
of
egyptian
idolatry
than
they
were
required
to
prepare
a
sanctuary
wherein
jehovah
would
manifest
his
presence
and
make
known
his
will
as
their
accepted
lord
and
king
the
tabernacle
which
from
the
time
of
its
construction
in
the
wilderness
and
thence
onward
throughout
the
period
of
wandering
and
for
centuries
thereafter
was
sacred
to
israel
as
the
sanctuary
of
jehovah
had
been
built
according
to
revealed
plan
and
specifications
it
was
a
compact
and
portable
structure
as
the
exigencies
of
migration
required
though
the
tabernacle
was
but
a
tent
it
was
made
of
the
best
the
most
prized
and
the
costliest
materials
the
people
possessed
this
condition
of
excellence
was
appropriate
and
fitting
for
the
finished
structure
was
a
nation
offering
unto
the
lord
its
construction
was
prescribed
in
minutest
detail
both
as
to
design
and
material
it
was
in
every
respect
the
best
the
people
could
give
and
jehovah
sanctified
the
proffered
gift
by
his
divine
acceptance
in
passing
let
us
be
mindful
of
the
fact
that
whether
it
be
the
gift
of
a
man
or
a
nation
the
best
if
offered
willingly
and
with
pure
intent
is
always
excellent
in
the
sight
of
god
however
poor
by
other
comparison
that
best
may
be
to
the
call
for
material
wherewith
to
build
the
tabernacle
there
was
such
willing
and
liberal
response
that
the
need
was
more
than
met
for
the
stuff
they
had
was
sufficient
for
all
the
work
to
make
it
and
too
much
proclamation
was
made
accordingly
and
the
people
were
restrained
from
bringing
more
the
artificers
and
workmen
engaged
in
the
making
of
the
tabernacle
were
designated
by
direct
revelation
or
chosen
by
divinely
appointed
authority
with
special
reference
to
their
skill
and
devotion
the
completed
tabernacle
viewed
in
relation
to
its
surroundings
and
considered
in
connection
with
the
circumstances
of
its
creation
was
an
imposing
structure
its
frames
were
of
rare
wood
its
inner
hangings
of
fine
linen
and
elaborate
embroideries
with
prescribed
designs
in
blue
purple
and
scarlet
its
middle
and
outer
curtains
of
choice
skins
its
metal
parts
of
brass
silver
and
gold
outside
the
tabernacle
but
within
its
enclosing
court
stood
the
altar
of
sacrifice
and
the
laver
or
font
the
first
apartment
of
the
tabernacle
proper
was
an
outer
room
or
holy
place
and
beyond
this
screened
from
observation
by
the
second
veil
was
the
inner
sanctuary
the
most
holy
place
specifically
known
as
the
holy
of
holies
in
the
appointed
order
only
the
priests
were
permitted
to
enter
the
outer
apartment
while
to
the
inner
place
the
holiest
of
all
none
but
the
high
priest
might
be
admitted
and
he
but
once
a
year
and
then
only
after
a
long
course
of
purification
and
sanctification
among
the
most
sacred
appurtenances
of
the
tabernacle
was
the
ark
of
the
covenant
this
was
a
casket
or
chest
made
of
the
best
wood
obtainable
lined
and
overlaid
with
pure
gold
and
provided
with
four
rings
of
gold
to
receive
the
rods
or
poles
used
in
carrying
the
ark
during
travel
the
ark
contained
certain
objects
of
sacred
import
such
as
the
golden
pot
of
manna
preserved
as
a
remembrance
and
to
this
were
afterward
added
aaron
rod
that
had
budded
and
the
tablets
of
stone
inscribed
by
the
hand
of
god
when
the
tabernacle
was
set
up
in
the
camp
of
israel
the
ark
was
placed
within
the
inner
veil
in
the
holy
of
holies
resting
upon
the
ark
was
the
mercy
seat
surmounted
by
a
pair
of
cherubim
made
of
beaten
gold
from
this
seat
did
the
lord
manifest
his
presence
even
as
promised
before
either
ark
or
tabernacle
had
been
made
and
there
i
will
meet
with
thee
and
i
will
commune
with
thee
from
above
the
mercy
seat
from
between
the
two
cherubims
which
are
upon
the
ark
of
the
testimony
of
all
things
which
i
will
give
thee
in
commandment
unto
the
children
of
israel
no
detailed
description
of
the
tabernacle
its
appurtenances
or
furniture
will
be
attempted
at
this
place
it
is
sufficient
for
our
present
purpose
to
know
that
the
camp
of
israel
had
such
a
sanctuary
that
it
was
constructed
according
to
revealed
plan
that
it
was
the
embodiment
of
the
best
the
people
could
give
both
as
to
material
and
workmanship
that
it
was
the
offering
of
the
people
to
their
god
and
was
duly
accepted
by
him
as
shall
yet
be
shown
the
tabernacle
was
a
prototype
of
the
more
stable
and
magnificent
temple
by
which
in
course
of
time
it
was
superseded
after
israel
had
become
established
in
the
land
of
promise
when
after
four
decades
of
wandering
in
the
wilderness
the
covenant
people
possessed
at
last
a
canaan
of
their
own
the
tabernacle
with
its
sacred
contents
was
given
a
resting
place
in
shiloh
and
thither
came
the
tribes
to
learn
the
will
and
word
of
god
afterward
it
was
removed
to
gibeon
and
yet
later
to
the
city
of
david
or
zion
david
the
second
king
of
israel
desired
and
planned
to
build
a
house
unto
the
lord
declaring
that
it
was
unfit
that
he
the
king
should
dwell
in
a
palace
of
cedar
while
the
sanctuary
of
god
was
but
a
tent
but
the
lord
spake
by
the
mouth
of
nathan
the
prophet
declining
the
proposed
offering
and
making
plain
the
fact
that
to
be
acceptable
unto
him
it
was
not
enough
that
the
gift
be
appropriate
but
that
the
giver
must
also
be
worthy
david
king
of
israel
though
in
many
respects
a
man
after
god
own
heart
had
sinned
and
his
sin
had
not
yet
found
atonement
thus
spake
the
king
i
had
in
mine
heart
to
build
an
house
of
rest
for
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
and
for
the
footstool
of
our
god
and
had
made
ready
for
the
building
but
god
said
unto
me
thou
shalt
not
build
an
house
for
my
name
because
thou
hast
been
a
man
of
war
and
hast
shed
blood
nevertheless
david
was
permitted
to
gather
material
for
the
house
of
the
lord
which
edifice
not
he
but
solomon
his
son
should
build
soon
after
solomon
accession
to
the
throne
he
set
about
the
labor
which
as
heritage
and
honor
had
come
to
him
with
his
crown
he
laid
the
foundation
in
the
fourth
year
of
his
reign
and
the
building
was
completed
within
seven
years
and
a
half
with
the
great
wealth
accumulated
by
his
kingly
father
and
specifically
reserved
for
the
building
of
the
temple
solomon
was
able
to
put
the
known
world
under
tribute
and
to
enlist
the
of
nations
in
his
great
undertaking
the
temple
workmen
numbered
scores
of
thousands
and
every
department
was
in
charge
of
master
craftsmen
to
serve
on
the
great
structure
in
any
capacity
was
an
honor
and
labor
acquired
a
dignity
never
before
recognized
masonry
became
a
profession
and
the
graded
orders
therein
established
have
endured
until
this
day
the
erection
of
the
temple
of
solomon
was
an
event
not
alone
in
the
history
of
israel
but
in
that
of
the
world
according
to
commonly
accepted
chronology
the
temple
was
finished
about
in
architecture
and
construction
in
design
and
costliness
it
is
known
as
one
of
the
most
remarkable
buildings
in
history
the
dedicatory
services
lasted
seven
days
a
week
of
holy
rejoicing
in
israel
with
fitting
ceremony
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
the
sacred
ark
of
the
covenant
were
brought
into
the
temple
and
the
ark
was
deposited
in
the
inner
sanctuary
the
most
holy
place
the
lord
gracious
acceptance
was
manifest
in
the
cloud
that
filled
the
sacred
chambers
as
the
priests
withdrew
so
that
the
priests
could
not
stand
to
minister
by
reason
of
the
cloud
for
the
glory
of
the
lord
had
filled
the
house
of
god
thus
did
the
temple
supersede
and
include
the
tabernacle
of
which
indeed
it
was
the
gorgeous
successor
a
comparison
of
the
plan
of
solomon
temple
with
that
of
the
earlier
tabernacle
shows
that
in
all
essentials
of
arrangement
and
proportion
the
two
were
so
nearly
alike
as
to
be
practically
identical
true
the
tabernacle
had
but
one
enclosure
while
the
temple
was
surrounded
by
courts
but
the
inner
structure
itself
the
temple
proper
closely
followed
the
earlier
design
the
dimensions
of
the
holy
of
holies
the
holy
place
and
the
porch
were
in
the
temple
exactly
double
those
of
the
corresponding
parts
in
the
tabernacle
the
glorious
of
this
splendid
structure
was
of
brief
duration
years
after
its
dedication
and
but
five
years
subsequent
to
the
death
of
solomon
its
decline
began
and
this
decline
was
soon
to
develop
into
general
spoliation
and
finally
to
become
an
actual
desecration
solomon
the
king
the
man
of
wisdom
the
had
been
led
astray
by
the
wiles
of
idolatrous
women
and
his
wayward
ways
had
fostered
iniquity
in
israel
the
nation
was
no
longer
a
unit
there
were
factions
and
sects
parties
and
creeds
some
worshipping
on
the
others
under
green
trees
each
party
claiming
excellence
for
its
own
particular
shrine
the
temple
soon
lost
its
sanctity
the
gift
became
depreciated
by
the
perfidy
of
the
giver
and
jehovah
withdrew
his
protecting
presence
from
the
place
no
longer

the
egyptians
from
whose
bondage
the
people
had
been
delivered
were

of
egypt
captured
jerusalem
the
city
of
david
and
the
site
of
the
temple
and
he
took
away
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
lord
part
of
the
aforetime
sacred
furniture
left
by
the
egyptians
was
taken
by
others
and
bestowed
upon
idols
the
work
of
desecration
continued
through
centuries
two
hundred
and
sixteen
years
after
the
egyptian
spoliation
ahaz
king
of
judah
robbed
the
temple
of
some
remaining
treasures
and
sent
part
of
its
remnant
of
gold
and
silver
as
a
present
to
a
pagan
king
whose
favor
he
sought
to
gain
furthermore
he
removed
the
altar
and
the
font
and
left
but
a
house
where
once
had
stood
a
temple
later
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
completed
the
despoiling
of
the
temple
and
carried
away
its
few
remaining
treasures
he
then
destroyed
the
building
itself
by
fire
thus
about
six
hundred
years
before
the
earthly
advent
of
our
lord
israel
was
left
without
a
temple
the
people
had
divided
there
were
two
kingdoms
israel
and
judah
each
at
enmity
with
the
other
they
had
become
idolatrous
and
altogether
wicked
the
lord
had
rejected
them
and
their
sanctuary
the
kingdom
of
israel
comprising
approximately
ten
of
the
twelve
tribes
had
been
made
subject
to
assyria
about
and
a
century
later
the
kingdom
of
judah
was
subdued
by
the
babylonians
for
seventy
years
the
people
of
judah
thereafter
known
as
jews
remained
in
captivity
even
as
had
been
predicted
then
under
the
friendly
rule
of
cyrus
and
darius
they
were
permitted
to
return
to
jerusalem
and
once
more
to
rear
a
temple
in
accordance
with
their
faith
in
remembrance
of
the
director
of
the
work
the
restored
temple
is
known
in
history
as
the
temple
of
zerubbabel
the
foundations
were
laid
with
solemn
ceremony
and
on
that
occasion
living
veterans
who
remembered
the
earlier
temple
wept
with
joy
in
spite
of
legal
technicalities
and
other
obstructions
the
work
continued
and
within
twenty
years
after
their
return
from
captivity
the
jews
had
a
temple
ready
for
dedication
the
temple
of
zerubbabel
was
finished
specifically
on
the
third
day
of
the
month
of
adar
in
the
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
darius
the
king
the
dedicatory
services
followed
immediately
while
this
temple
was
greatly
inferior
in
richness
of
finish
and
furniture
as
compared
with
the
splendid
temple
of
solomon
it
was
nevertheless
the
best
the
people
could
build
and
the
lord
accepted
it
as
an
offering
typifying
the
love
and
devotion
of
his
covenant
children
in
proof
of
this
divine
acceptance
witness
the
ministrations
of
such
prophets
as
zechariah
haggai
and
malachi
within
its
walls
about
sixteen
years
before
the
birth
of
christ
herod
i
king
of
judea
commenced
the
reconstruction
of
the
then
decayed
and
generally
ruinous
temple
of
zerubbabel
for
five
centuries
that
structure
had
stood
and
doubtless
it
had
become
largely
a
wreck
of
time
many
incidents
in
the
earthly
life
of
the
savior
are
associated
with
the
temple
of
herod
it
is
evident
from
scripture
that
while
opposed
to
the
degraded
and
commercial
uses
to
which
the
temple
had
been
betrayed
christ
recognized
and
acknowledged
the
sanctity
of
the
temple
precincts
the
temple
of
herod
was
a
sacred
structure
by
whatsoever
name
it
might
have
been
known
it
was
to
him
the
house
of
the
lord
and
then
when
the
sable
curtain
descended
upon
the
great
tragedy
of
calvary
when
at
last
the
agonizing
cry
it
is
finished
ascended
from
the
cross
the
veil
of
the
temple
was
rent
and
the
holy
of
holies
was
bared
the
absolute
destruction
of
the
temple
had
been
foretold
by
our
lord
while
yet
he
lived
in
the
flesh
in
the
year
the
temple
was
utterly
destroyed
by
fire
in
connection
with
the
capture
of
jerusalem
by
the
romans
under
titus
the
temple
of
herod
was
the
last
temple
reared
on
the
eastern
hemisphere
from
the
destruction
of
that
great
edifice
onward
to
the
time
of
the
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
in
the
nineteenth
century
our
only
record
of
temple
building
is
such
mention
as
is
found
in
nephite
chronicles
book
of
mormon
scriptures
affirm
that
temples
were
erected
by
the
nephite
colonists
on
what
is
now
known
as
the
american
continent
but
we
have
few
details
of
construction
and
fewer
facts
as
to
administrative
ordinances
pertaining
to
these
western
temples
the
people
constructed
a
temple
about
and
this
we
learn
was
patterned
after
the
temple
of
solomon
though
greatly
inferior
to
that
gorgeous
structure
in
grandeur
and
costliness
it
is
of
interest
to
read
that
when
the
resurrected
lord
manifested
himself
to
the
nephites
on
the
western
continent
he
found
them
assembled
about
the
temple
the
book
of
mormon
however
makes
no
mention
of
temples
even
as
late
as
the
time
of
the
destruction
of
the
temple
at
jerusalem
and
moreover
the
nephite
nation
came
to
an
end
within
about
four
centuries
after
christ
it
is
evident
therefore
that
on
both
hemispheres
temples
ceased
to
exist
in
the
early
period
of
the
apostasy
and
the
very
conception
of
a
temple
in
the
distinctive
sense
perished
amongst
mankind
for
many
centuries
no
offer
of
a
sanctuary
was
made
unto
the
lord
indeed
it
appears
that
no
need
of
such
was
recognized
the
apostate
church
declared
that
direct
communication
from
god
had
ceased
and
in
place
of
divine
administration
a
government
claimed
supreme
power
it
is
evident
that
as
far
as
the
church
was
concerned
the
voice
of
the
lord
had
been
silenced
that
the
people
were
no
longer
willing
to
listen
to
the
word
of
revelation
and
that
the
government
of
the
church
had
been
abrogated
by
human
agencies
when
in
the
reign
of
constantine
a
perverted
christianity
had
become
the
religion
of
state
the
need
of
a
place
wherein
god
would
reveal
himself
was
still
utterly
unseen
or
ignored
true
many
edifices
most
of
them
costly
and
grand
were
erected
of
these
some
were
dedicated
to
peter
and
paul
to
james
and
john
others
to
the
magdalene
and
the
virgin
but
not
one
was
raised
by
authority
and
name
to
the
honor
of
jesus
the
christ
among
the
multitude
of
chapels
and
shrines
of
churches
and
cathedrals
the
son
of
man
had
not
a
place
to
call
his
own
it
was
declared
that
the
pope
sitting
in
rome
was
the
vicegerent
of
christ
and
that
without
revelation
he
was
empowered
to
declare
the
will
of
god
not
until
the
gospel
was
restored
in
the
nineteenth
century
with
its
ancient
powers
and
privileges
was
the
holy
priesthood
manifest
again
among
men
and
be
it
remembered
that
the
authority
to
speak
and
act
in
the
name
of
god
is
essential
to
a
temple
and
a
temple
is
void
without
the
sacred
authority
of
the
holy
priesthood
in
the
year
of
our
lord
joseph
smith
the
prophet
of
the
latest
dispensation
then
a
lad
in
his
fifteenth
year
received
a
divine
manifestation
in
which
both
the
eternal
father
and
his
son
jesus
christ
appeared
and
instructed
the
youthful
suppliant
through
joseph
smith
the
gospel
of
old
was
restored
to
earth
and
the
ancient
law
was
in
course
of
time
through
the
ministry
of
the
prophet
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
was
organized
and
its
establishment
was
marked
by
manifestations
of
divine
power
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
this
church
true
to
the
distinction
it
affirms
that
of
being
the
church
of
the
living
god
as
its
name
proclaims
began
in
the
very
early
days
of
its
history
to
provide
for
the
erection
of
a
temple
the
church
was
organized
as
an
earthly
on
the
sixth
of
april
and
in
july
of
the
year
following
a
revelation
was
received
designating
the
site
of
a
future
temple
near
independence
missouri
the
construction
of
a
temple
on
this
chosen
spot
is
yet
delayed
as
is
also
the
case
with
another
in
far
west
missouri
on
which
the
were
laid
in
the
church
holds
as
a
sacred
trust
the
commission
to
build
the
temples
so
located
but
as
yet
the
way
has
not
been
opened
for
the
consummation
of
the
plan
in
the
meantime
temples
in
other
places
have
been
reared
and
already
the
modern
dispensation
is
marked
by
the
erection
of
six
such
sacred
edifices
on
the
first
day
of
june
in
a
revelation
to
the
prophet
joseph
smith
the
lord
directed
the
immediate
building
of
a
holy
house
in
which
he
promised
to
endow
his
chosen
servants
with
power
and
authority
the
people
responded
to
the
call
with
willingness
and
devotion
in
spite
of
dire
poverty
and
in
the
face
of
unrelenting
persecution
the
work
was
carried
to
completion
and
in
march
the
first
temple
of
modern
times
was
dedicated
at
kirtland
ohio
the
dedicatory
services
were
marked
by
divine
manifestations
comparable
to
those
attending
the
offering
of
the
first
temple
of
olden
times
and
on
later
occasions
heavenly
beings
appeared
within
the
sacred
precincts
with
revelations
of
the
divine
will
to
man
in
that
place
the
lord
jesus
was
again
seen
and
heard
within
two
years
from
the
time
of
its
dedication
the
kirtland
temple
was
abandoned
by
the
people
who
built
it
they
were
forced
to
flee
because
of
persecution
and
with
their
departure
the
sacred
temple
became
an
ordinary
house
disowned
of
the
lord
to
whose
name
it
had
been
reared
the
building
still
stands
and
is
used
as
a
by
a
small
and
comparatively
unknown
sect
the
migration
of
the
saints
was
to
the
west
and
they
established
themselves
first
in
missouri
and
later
in
illinois
with
nauvoo
as
the
central
seat
of
the
church
scarcely
had
they
become
settled
in
their
new
abode
when
the
voice
of
revelation
was
heard
calling
upon
the
people
to
again
build
a
house
sacred
to
the
name
of
god
the
of
the
nauvoo
temple
were
laid
april
and
the
capstone
was
placed
in
position
may
each
event
was
celebrated
by
a
solemn
assembly
and
sacred
service
though
it
was
evident
that
the
people
would
be
forced
to
flee
again
and
though
they
knew
that
the
temple
would
have
to
be
abandoned
soon
after
completion
they
labored
with
might
and
diligence
to
finish
and
properly
furnish
the
structure
it
was
dedicated
april
though
certain
portions
such
as
the
baptistry
had
been
previously
dedicated
and
used
in
ordinance
work
many
of
the
saints
received
their
blessings
and
holy
endowments
in
the
nauvoo
temple
though
even
before
the
completion
of
the
building
the
exodus
of
the
people
had
begun
the
temple
was
abandoned
by
those
who
in
poverty
and
by
sacrifice
had
reared
it
in
november
it
became
a
prey
to
incendiary
flames
and
in
may
a
tornado
demolished
what
remained
of
the
blackened
walls
on
the
of
july
the
mormon
pioneers
entered
the
valleys
of
utah
while
yet
the
region
was
mexican
territory
and
established
a
settlement
where
now
stands
salt
lake
city
four
days
later
brigham
young
prophet
and
leader
indicated
a
site
in
the
wastes
and
striking
the
arid
ground
with
his
staff
proclaimed
here
will
be
the
temple
of
our
god
that
site
is
now
the
beautiful
temple
block
around
which
the
city
has
grown
in
february
the
area
was
dedicated
with
sacred
service
and
on
the
of
april
following
the
corner
stones
of
the
building
were
laid
to
the
accompaniment
of
solemn
and
imposing
ceremony
the
salt
lake
city
temple
was
forty
years
in
building
the
capstone
was
laid
on
the
of
april
and
the
completed
temple
was
dedicated
one
year
later
of
the
four
temples
already
erected
in
utah
the
one
in
salt
lake
city
was
the
first
begun
and
the
last
finished
during
its
course
of
construction
three
other
temples
were
built
by
the
saints
one
at
george
one
at
logan
and
one
at
manti
utah
add
to
these
the
two
earlier
temples
at
kirtland
ohio
and
at
nauvoo
illinois
and
we
have
six
of
these
sacred
structures
already
erected
in
the
present
and
last
dispensation
of
the
priesthood
the
dispensation
of
the
fulness
of
times
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
present
chapter
to
consider
in
detail
any
particular
temple
either
ancient
or
modern
but
rather
to
show
the
essential
and
distinguishing
features
of
temples
and
to
make
plain
the
fact
that
in
both
ancient
and
modern
times
the
covenant
people
have
regarded
the
building
of
temples
as
a
labor
specifically
required
at
their
hands
from
what
has
been
said
it
is
plain
that
a
temple
is
more
than
chapel
or
church
more
than
synagogue
or
cathedral
it
is
a
structure
erected
as
the
house
of
the
lord
sacred
to
the
closest
communion
between
the
lord
himself
and
the
holy
priesthood
and
devoted
to
the
highest
and
most
sacred
ordinances
characteristic
of
the
age
or
dispensation
to
which
the
particular
temple
belongs
moreover
to
be
indeed
a
holy
temple
accepted
of
god
and
by
him
acknowledged
as
his
house
the
offering
must
have
been
called
for
and
both
gift
and
giver
must
be
worthy
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
proclaims
that
it
is
the
possessor
of
the
holy
priesthood
again
restored
to
earth
and
that
it
is
invested
with
divine
commission
to
erect
and
maintain
temples
dedicated
to
the
name
and
service
of
the
true
and
living
god
and
to
administer
within
those
sacred
structures
the
ordinances
of
the
priesthood
the
effect
of
which
shall
be
binding
both
on
earth
and
beyond
the
grave
footnotes
in
this
connection
it
is
interesting
and
instructive
to
consider
the
significance
of
the
name
a
contraction
of
as
applied
by
jacob
to
the
place
where
the
presence
of
the
lord
was
manifest
unto
him
said
he
surely
the
lord
is
in
this
place
and
i
knew
it
not
and
he
was
afraid
and
said
how
dreadful
is
this
place
this
is
none
other
but
the
house
of
god
and
this
is
the
gate
of
heaven
and
jacob
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
took
the
stone
that
he
had
put
for
his
pillows
and
set
it
up
for
a
pillar
and
poured
oil
upon
the
top
of
it

he

of
that

sanctuaries
in
earlier
dispensations
as
understood
and
applied
herein
the
designation
temple
is
restricted
to
mean
an
actual
structure
reared
by
man
hallowed
and
sanctified
for
the
special
service
of
deity
such
service
including
the
authoritative
administration
of
ordinances
pertaining
to
the
holy
priesthood
and
not
merely
a
place
however
sacred
the
spot
may
have
become
if
sacred
places
were
to
be
classed
with
sacred
buildings
as
essentially
temples
the
category
would
include
many
a
holy
bethel
rarely
considered
as
such
in
the
more
extended
application
of
the
term
the
garden
in
eden
was
the
first
sanctuary
of
earth
for
therein
did
the
lord
first
speak
unto
man
and
make
known
the
divine
law
so
too
sinai
became
a
sanctuary
for
the
mount
was
consecrated
as
the
special
abode
of
the
lord
while
he
communed
with
the
prophet
and
issued
his
decrees
the
sanctity
of
such
places
was
as
that
of
horeb
where
god
spake
unto
moses
from
the
midst
of
the
flame
and
where
as
the
man
approached
he
was
halted
by
the
command
draw
not
nigh
hither
put
off
thy
shoes
from
off
thy
feet
for
the
place
whereon
thou
standest
is
holy
ground
a
temple
however
is
characterized
not
alone
as
the
place
where
god
reveals
himself
to
man
but
also
as
the
house
wherein
prescribed
ordinances
of
the
priesthood
are
solemnized
the
testimony
prior
to
the
construction
of
the
tabernacle
in
the
wilderness
and
indeed
during
the
early
stages
of
the
memorable
journey
from
egypt
the
people
of
israel
had
a
certain
depository
for
sacred
things
known
as
the
testimony
this
is
definitely
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
following
incident
under
divine
direction
a
vessel
of
manna
was
to
be
preserved
lest
the
people
forget
the
power
and
goodness
of
god
by
which
they
had
been
fed
and
moses
said
this
is
the
thing
which
the
lord
commandeth
fill
an
omer
of
it
to
be
kept
for
your
generations
that
they
may
see
the
bread
wherewith
i
have
fed
you
in
the
wilderness
when
i
brought
you
forth
from
the
land
of
egypt
and
moses
said
unto
aaron
take
a
pot
and
put
an
omer
full
of
manna
therein
and
lay
it
up
before
the
lord
to
be
kept
for
your
generations
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
so
aaron
laid
it
up
before
the
testimony
to
be
kept
there
appears
little
room
for
doubt
that
the
testimony
here
referred
to
was
a
material
structure
and
that
its
name
is
suggestive
of
divine
witness
as
to
its
sacred
character
inasmuch
as
the
account
of
the
exodus
contains
no
mention
of
the
making
of
such
a
structure
and
moreover
as
its
existence
and
use
were
definitely
affirmed
before
the
people
had
had
time
or
opportunity
to
shape
it
in
the
wilderness
it
would
seem
that
they
must
have
brought
the
sacred
testimony
with
them
from
egypt
this
incident
is
of
interest
and
importance
as
indicating
the
existence
of
a
holy
sanctuary
during
the
formative
stages
of
israel
growth
as
a
nation
and
while
the
people
were
in
subjection
to
idolatrous
rulers
this
application
of
the
term
testimony
must
not
be
confused
with
later
usage
by
which
the
tables
of
stone
bearing
the
divinely
inscribed
decalogue
are
so
designated
it
is
to
be
noted
further
that
the
tabernacle
wherein
was
housed
the
ark
of
the
covenant
containing
the
sacred
tables
of
stone
is
distinctively
called
the
tabernacle
of
testimony
these
several
uses
of
the
term
lead
to
no
ambiguity
if
the
context
be
duly
considered
in
each
case
the
provisional
tabernacle
while
moses
communed
with
the
lord
on
sinai
the
people
left
for
a
time
to
themselves
set
up
a
golden
calf
in
imitation
of
apis
an
egyptian
idol
and
in
consequence
of
their
idolatrous
orgies
the
lord
anger
was
kindled
against
them
during
the
period
of
their
consequent
estrangement
before
a
reconciliation
had
been
effected
between
jehovah
and
his
people
divine
manifestations
ceased
within
the
camp
and
only
afar
off
could
the
lord
be
found
in
connection
with
this
condition
we
read
of
the
establishment
of
a
temporary
place
of
meeting
possibly
the
dwelling
tent
of
moses
which
became
sanctified
by
the
divine
presence
thus
runs
the
record
and
moses
took
the
tabernacle
and
pitched
it
without
the
camp
afar
off
from
the
camp
and
called
it
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
it
came
to
pass
that
every
one
which
sought
the
lord
went
out
into
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
which
was
without
the
camp
and
it
came
to
pass
when
moses
went
out
unto
the
tabernacle
that
all
the
people
rose
up
and
stood
every
man
at
his
tent
door
and
looked
after
moses
until
he
was
gone
into
the
tabernacle
and
it
came
to
pass
as
moses
entered
into
the
tabernacle
the
cloudy
pillar
descended
and
stood
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
and
the
lord
talked
with
moses
and
all
the
people
saw
the
cloudy
pillar
stand
at
the
tabernacle
door
and
all
the
people
rose
up
and
worshipped
every
man
in
his
tent
door
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
face
to
face
as
a
man
speaketh
unto
his
friend
and
he
turned
again
into
the
camp
but
his
servant
joshua
the
son
of
nun
a
young
man
departed
not
out
of
the
tabernacle
that
the
tent
here
called
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
is
not
the
elaborate
and
costly
structure
specially
built
as
the
lord
directed
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
the
greater
and
more
enduring
tabernacle
had
not
been
constructed
at
the
time
referred
to
in
the
scripture
last
cited
unlike
the
later
tabernacle
which
was
set
up
in
the
center
of
the
camp
with
the
tribes
massed
about
it
in
specified
order
this
provisional
tabernacle
was
pitched
outside
the
camp
afar
off
perhaps
as
an
indication
of
the
lord
withdrawal
following
israel
idolatrous
turning
away
from
him
that
the
provisional
tabernacle
was
however
a
holy
sanctuary
is
attested
by
the
personal
communion
therein
between
jehovah
and
his
servant
moses
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
from
amidst
the
clouds
and
to
the
accompaniments
of
thunders
and
lightnings
on
sinai
the
lord
gave
unto
moses
the
law
and
the
testimony
not
alone
did
moses
there
talk
with
the
lord
in
person
but
by
divine
command
aaron
and
his
sons
nadab
and
abihu
together
with
seventy
of
the
elders
of
israel
went
up
upon
the
mountain
and
did
see
god
even
the
god
of
israel
over
sinai
the
glory
of
the
lord
abode
for
many
days
and
moses
went
into
the
midst
of
the
cloud
and
gat
him
up
into
the
mount
and
moses
was
in
the
mount
forty
days
and
forty
nights
when
he
descended
moses
bore
with
him
the
commission
to
call
upon
the
children
of
israel
for
contributions
and
offerings
of
their
substance
and
all
their
precious
things
such
as
would
be
suitable
for
the
construction
of
a
sanctuary
for
service
in
the
wilderness
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
speak
unto
the
children
of
israel
that
they
bring
me
an
offering
of
every
man
that
giveth
it
willingly
with
his
heart
ye
shall
take
my
offering
and
this
is
the
offering
which
ye
shall
take
of
them
gold
and
silver
and
brass
and
blue
and
purple
and
scarlet
and
fine
linen
and
goats
hair
and
rams
skins
dyed
red
and
badgers
skins
and
shittim
wood
oil
for
the
light
spices
for
anointing
oil
and
for
sweet
incense
onyx
stones
and
stones
to
be
set
in
the
ephod
and
in
the
breastplate
and
let
them
make
me
a
sanctuary
that
i
may
dwell
among
them
according
to
all
that
i
shew
thee
after
the
pattern
of
the
tabernacle
and
the
pattern
of
all
the
instruments
thereof
even
so
shall
ye
make
it
the
response
of
the
people
was
so
liberal
and
prompt
that
a
surplus
of
material
was
soon
amassed
and
they
spake
unto
moses
saying
the
people
bring
much
more
than
enough
for
the
service
of
the
work
which
the
lord
commanded
to
make
and
moses
gave
commandment
and
they
caused
it
to
be
proclaimed
throughout
the
camp
saying
let
neither
man
nor
woman
make
any
more
work
for
the
offering
of
the
sanctuary
so
the
people
were
restrained
from
bringing
for
the
stuff
they
had
was
sufficient
for
all
the
work
to
make
it
and
too
much
divine
direction
was
manifest
in
the
appointment
of
men
who
should
be
in
charge
of
the
labor
bezaleel
the
son
of
uri
and
aholiab
the
son
of
ahisamach
were
designated
by
revelation
as
the
master
craftsmen
under
whose
direction
the
other
workers
should
labor
until
all
had
been
finished
in
direct
accord
with
the
revealed
pattern
and
plan
and
when
so
finished
it
was
the
embodiment
of
the
best
in
material
and
workmanship
the
tabernacle
stood
in
an
outer
enclosure
or
court
walled
in
by
canvas
screens
with
entrance
curtains
finely
embroidered
the
curtains
that
formed
the
walls
of
the
court
were
suspended
from
pillars
which
stood
at
intervals
along
the
sides
of
an
oblong
the
longer
walls
ran
east
and
west
with
the
main
entrance
to
the
enclosure
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
two
squares
within
the
curtains
the
easterly
was
reserved
for
assemblies
of
the
people
while
the
square
to
the
west
constituted
the
more
sacred
area
pertaining
to
the
tabernacle
itself
the
entire
space
so
enclosed
covered
one
hundred
cubits
east
and
west
and
fifty
cubits
north
and
south
or
approximately
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
by
feet
in
the
easterly
section
and
therefore
removed
from
the
tabernacle
stood
the
altar
of
between
the
altar
and
the
tabernacle
stood
the
laver
this
was
a
large
vessel
of
brass
standing
upon
a
pedestal
and
containing
water
for
the
ceremonial
cleansing
of
the
hands
and
feet
of
the
priests
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
laver
and
its
supporting
pedestal
were
made
by
special
contribution
of
the
women
who
gave
their
brazen
mirrors
for
this
purpose
the
tabernacle
stood
with
its
longer
axis
east
and
west
and
with
its
entrance
on
the
easterly
side
the
structure
was
but
thirty
cubits
long
by
ten
cubits
broad
or
by
fifteen
feet
these
are
the
dimensions
given
by
josephus
and
they
are
practically
in
accord
with
the
description
in
exodus
which
states
that
the
walls
comprised
twenty
boards
on
a
side
each
board
one
and
a
half
cubits
wide
at
the
west
end
there
were
six
boards
each
one
and
a
half
cubits
wide
or
nine
cubits
in
all
these
with
the
angle
posts
would
make
the
entire
breadth
equal
to
that
given
by
josephus
ten
cubits
the
boards
of
the
walls
were
held
together
by
having
sockets
of
silver
two
to
each
board
the
boards
themselves
were
overlaid
with
gold
and
were
provided
with
rings
of
the
same
metal
to
receive
the
bars
which
also
were
overlaid
with
gold
it
will
be
seen
that
the
tabernacle
was
but
a
small
structure
entirely
unsuited
to
the
accommodation
of
large
assemblies
but
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
for
such
it
was
never
intended
within
the
tabernacle
only
the
appointed
bearers
of
the
priesthood
officiated
and
of
these
none
but
the
few
actually
engaged
in
the
service
of
the
day
could
be
admitted
the
tabernacle
was
divided
by
a
curtain
specifically
called
the
veil
into
two
compartments
the
outer
of
which
was
known
as
the
holy
place
and
the
inner
as
the
most
holy
place
or
holy
of
holies
josephus
and
some
others
state
that
the
tabernacle
comprised
three
parts
the
third
division
however
was
really
outside
the
main
tent
and
appeared
as
a
porch
at
the
east
end
five
cubits
deep
and
extending
across
the
entire
front
the
veil
which
separated
the
holy
place
from
the
holy
of
holies
was
of
fine
workmanship
of
blue
and
purple
and
scarlet
and
fine
twined
linen
of
cunning
work
and
was
embroidered
with
cherubim
it
was
hung
upon
four
pillars
of
wood
overlaid
with
gold
the
hooks
were
of
gold
and
the
sockets
of
silver
the
wood
used
for
these
pillars
as
indeed
that
used
in
other
parts
of
the
structure
was
the
rare
costly
and
durable
shittim
or
acacia
sometimes
known
as
beyond
the
veil
the
enclosure
was
most
holy
and
therein
was
placed
the
ark
of
the
covenant
with
its
mercy
seat
bearing
the
sacred
cherubim
the
description
of
which
appears
in
the
record
as
follows
and
bezaleel
made
the
ark
of
shittim
wood
two
cubits
and
a
half
was
the
length
of
it
and
a
cubit
and
a
half
the
breadth
of
it
and
a
cubit
and
a
half
the
height
of
it
and
he
overlaid
it
with
pure
gold
within
and
without
and
made
a
crown
of
gold
to
it
round
about
and
he
cast
for
it
four
rings
of
gold
to
be
set
by
the
four
corners
of
it
even
two
rings
upon
the
one
side
of
it
and
two
rings
upon
the
other
side
of
it
and
he
made
staves
of
shittim
wood
and
overlaid
them
with
gold
and
he
put
the
staves
into
the
rings
by
the
sides
of
the
ark
to
bear
the
ark
and
he
made
the
mercy
seat
of
pure
gold
two
cubits
and
a
half
was
the
length
thereof
and
one
cubit
and
half
the
breadth
thereof
and
he
made
two
cherubims
of
gold
beaten
out
of
one
piece
made
he
them
on
the
two
ends
of
the
mercy
seat
one
cherub
on
the
end
on
this
side
and
another
cherub
on
the
other
end
on
that
side
out
of
the
mercy
seat
made
he
the
cherubims
on
the
two
ends
thereof
and
the
cherubims
spread
out
their
wings
on
high
and
covered
with
their
wings
over
the
mercy
seat
with
their
faces
one
to
another
even
to
the
mercy
seatward
were
the
faces
of
the
cherubims
outside
the
veil
yet
within
the
tabernacle
was
the
holy
place
in
this
were
placed
the
table
of
shewbread
the
altar
of
incense
and
the
golden
candlestick
the
rich
fabrics
of
delicate
workmanship
forming
the
walls
and
roof
of
the
tabernacle
were
protected
by
coarser
hangings
of
goats
hair
and
these
in
turn
by
a
covering
of
skins
the
structure
as
completed
is
referred
to
in
the
scripture
sometimes
as
the
tent
of
the
congregation
and
at
others
as
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
the
former
expression
occurs
thirteen
times
the
latter
one
hundred
and
times
yet
notwithstanding
this
difference
the
original
in
each
case
was
the
best
authenticated
translation
of
which
is
the
tent
of
meeting
let
it
not
be
supposed
however
that
this
means
in
the
ordinary
sense
a
for
the
meeting
here
expressed
is
not
that
of
a
concourse
of
worshippers
but
the
place
of
communion
between
god
and
his
priesthood
the
tent
of
meeting
or
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
in
israel
was
the
lord
tent
wherein
he
met
the
authorized
representatives
of
his
people
on
the
first
day
of
the
second
year
following
israel
exodus
from
egypt
the
tabernacle
was
set
up
for
the
first
time
and
all
the
sacred
furniture
was
disposed
according
to
the
direct
commands
of
the
lord
the
veil
was
hung
and
the
place
was
consecrated
as
a
most
holy
spot
ineffably
sacred
as
the
dwelling
place
of
jehovah
then
even
as
on
sinai
a
cloud
had
shrouded
the
temporary
abiding
place
of
god
so
was
it
with
the
tabernacle
then
a
cloud
covered
the
tent
of
the
congregation
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
filled
the
tabernacle
and
moses
was
not
able
to
enter
into
the
tent
of
the
congregation
because
the
cloud
abode
thereon
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
filled
the
tabernacle
and
when
the
cloud
was
taken
up
from
over
the
tabernacle
the
children
of
israel
went
onward
in
all
their
journeys
but
if
the
cloud
were
not
taken
up
then
they
journeyed
not
till
the
day
that
it
was
taken
up
for
the
cloud
of
the
lord
was
upon
the
tabernacle
by
day
and
fire
was
on
it
by
night
in
the
sight
of
all
the
house
of
israel
throughout
all
their
journeys
the
and
thought
in
the
erection
of
this
portable
sanctuary
was
that
of
expressing
the
close
association
between
jehovah
and
his
people
the
people
were
to
consider
themselves
specifically
the
people
of
god
and
amongst
them
should
be
his
dwelling
surpassing
in
a
transcendent
degree
the
presence
of
the
gods
of
wood
and
stone
housed
among
the
idolatrous
nations
with
whom
israel
had
to
contend
this
thought
was
expressed
in
the
earliest
commandment
respecting
the
building
of
the
tabernacle
and
let
them
make
me
a
sanctuary
that
i
may
dwell
among
them
even
more
truly
indispensable
than
tabernacle
or
temple
in
the
maintenance
of
close
relationship
with
deity
is
the
priesthood
it
was
therefore
to
be
expected
that
with
the
establishment
of
a
holy
sanctuary
appointments
and
ordinations
should
be
made
whereby
men
would
be
truly
set
apart
to
the
sacred
offices
of
the
priesthood
while
moses
was
the
great
high
priest
of
israel
standing
at
the
head
of
a
distinctive
dispensation
of
divine
authority
and
power
there
were
many
priestly
functions
pertaining
to
the
less
exalted
orders
and
unto
these
aaron
and
his
four
sons
nadab
abihu
eleazer
and
ithamar
were
set
apart
as
the
tabernacle
had
been
built
under
express
direction
extending
even
into
minute
detail
so
the
ministrations
of
the
priesthood
were
prescribed
and
the
order
of
worship
was
established
whereby
the
people
should
be
reminded
that
amongst
them
dwelt
jehovah
before
whom
they
should
set
none
other
gods
the
tabernacle
was
prepared
primarily
for
migratory
service
its
parts
therefore
were
separately
finished
and
so
fitted
as
to
permit
of
easy
putting
together
or
taking
apart
when
set
up
within
its
court
the
tabernacle
occupied
the
place
of
honor
in
the
center
of
the
camp
on
the
east
and
therefore
immediately
before
the
entrance
to
the
court
were
the
tents
of
the
priests
while
on
the
other
three
sides
the
levites
were
encamped
these
being
closest
in
attendance
have
been
likened
to
the
of
the
great
king
whose
throne
was
within
the
sanctuary
and
beyond
them
were
stationed
the
other
tribes
in
order
of
established
precedence
while
dismantled
and
in
transit
when
the
people
were
on
the
march
the
tabernacle
still
held
the
central
place
its
bearers
were
the
levites
and
the
whole
army
of
israel
was
its
guard
until
israel
had
become
permanently
established
in
the
land
of
promise
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
had
but
temporary
resting
places
as
the
people
moved
the
sanctuary
was
carried
until
it
found
a
somewhat
more
permanent
home
at
shiloh
there
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
the
final
apportionment
of
canaan
among
the
tribes
was
made
there
it
remained
during
the
period
of
the
judges
and
until
after
the
ark
of
god
had
been
allowed
to
pass
from
the
custody
of
israel
to
that
of
the
philistines
because
of
sin
the
glory
of
the
sanctuary
was
largely
lost
and
though
the
tabernacle
continued
in
existence
its
sacred
service
was
in
abeyance
sadly
was
the
truth
declared
the
glory
is
departed
from
israel
for
the
ark
of
god
is
taken
there
is
evidence
that
for
a
short
time
during
the
reign
of
saul
the
tabernacle
was
established
at
nob
for
there
we
find
the
priest
ahimelech
maintaining
the
service
of
the
but
the
ark
of
the
covenant
was
certainly
not
there
we
next
learn
of
the
tabernacle
having
been
set
up
at
gibeon
though
the
conditions
resulting
in
its
removal
thither
are
not
fully
stated
the
ark
was
housed
in
another
tent
and
finally
both
were
brought
into
the
splendid
temple
of
solomon
by
which
all
earlier
sanctuaries
were
superseded
the
third
tabernacle
yet
another
tent
of
sanctuary
was
made
and
used
in
israel
prior
to
the
erection
of
the
great
temple
this
we
may
call
for
convenience
the
third
tabernacle
it
was
erected
by
david
the
king
in
his
own
city
as
a
shelter
for
the
ark
of
the
covenant
as
already
cited
the
scriptural
record
tells
of
the
capture
of
the
ark
by
the
philistines
and
of
its
return
to
israel
this
incident
occurred
during
the
latter
part
of
the
administration
of
the
judges
before
israel
had
bowed
to
a
king
in
canaan
throughout
the
reign
of
saul
the
ark
remained
under
the
roof
of
a
private
dwelling
wherein
however
a
priest
was
maintained
for
its
care
and
ministry
one
of
the
early
acts
of
david
after
he
became
king
was
to
plan
the
removal
of
the
ark
to
a
more
suitable
situation
in
the
course
of
this
removal
uzzah
was
stricken
because
without
authority
he
essayed
to
take
hold
of
the
sacred
vessel
and
this
manifestation
of
divine
displeasure
so
affected
david
that
he
delayed
his
purpose
of
setting
up
the
ark
in
his
own
city
and
placed
it
in
another
private
house
that
of
the
gittite
while
the
ark
remained
beneath
that
roof
the
household
was
blessed
and
prospered
in
course
of
time
the
original
plan
was
carried
into
effect
and
the
ark
was
set
up
in
a
tent
specially
prepared
for
its
reception
in
the
city
of
david
and
they
brought
in
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
set
it
in
his
place
in
the
midst
of
the
tabernacle
that
david
had
pitched
for
it
and
david
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
before
the
lord
thus
during
the
reign
of
david
there
were
two
places
regarded
as
sanctuaries
and
the
worship
of
the
people
was
divided
solomon
appears
to
have
acknowledged
the
sanctity
of
both
places
the
resting
place
of
the
ark
at
jerusalem
and
the
place
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
at
gibeon
through
him
both
shrines
were
again
brought
together
the
temple
of
solomon
scarcely
had
the
ark
of
the
covenant
been
deposited
at
the
capital
of
the
kingdom
the
city
of
david
when
the
king
became
desirous
of
erecting
for
its
accommodation
a
more
enduring
shelter
than
the
tent
in
which
it
had
been
installed
with
pomp
and
ceremony
it
appears
that
the
conscience
of
the
king
was
troubled
by
the
thought
that
he
was
better
housed
than
was
the
sanctuary
of
the
lord
now
it
came
to
pass
as
david
sat
in
his
house
that
david
said
to
nathan
the
prophet
lo
i
dwell
in
an
house
of
cedars
but
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
remaineth
under
curtains
it
was
david
desire
to
build
a
suitable
house
for
the
lord
and
nathan
the
prophet
at
first
encouraged
the
undertaking
the
lord
spake
to
nathan
however
and
directed
him
to
decline
the
king
proffered
gift
although
jehovah
had
been
without
a
fixed
place
recognized
by
the
people
as
his
though
as
he
said
he
had
not
dwelt
in
a
house
amongst
israel
but
had
gone
from
tent
to
tent
and
from
one
tabernacle
to
another
though
as
the
context
implies
the
lord
had
been
neglected
in
the
long
delay
attending
the
erection
of
a
house
to
his
name
nevertheless
david
could
not
be
honored
with
the
commission
or
even
the
permission
to
build
such
a
house
for
he
was
accounted
a
man
of
blood
let
us
not
undertake
to
judge
the
extent
of
david
offending
to
do
so
would
be
to
usurp
the
divine
prerogative
it
is
enough
for
us
to
know
that
even
the
gift
of
royalty
may
be
declined
if
there
be
aught
requiring
reconciliation
between
the
mortal
and
his
god
david
however
was
permitted
to
provide
means
and
to
gather
material
which
afterward
should
be
used
in
the
erection
of
the
temple
moreover
the
very
site
on
which
the
great
building
was
subsequently
erected
was
chosen
and
sanctified
through
his
agency
a
great
pestilence
had
fallen
upon
israel
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
sent
forth
with
the
warrant
of
destruction
was
seen
by
david
standing
sword
in
hand
on
mount
moriah
at
the
threshing
floor
of
araunah
the
jebusite
that
spot
hallowed
by
the
presence
of
a
heavenly
messenger
though
that
messenger
was
the
angel
of
death
was
marked
by
the
erection
of
an
altar
as
the
lord
directed
through
the
prophet
gad
as
david
realized
that
his
years
of
life
were
few
he
laid
upon
solomon
his
son
and
chosen
successor
the
solemn
charge
to
build
the
house
he
had
been
forbidden
to
build
the
king
dwelt
pathetically
upon
his
own
disqualification
and
then
repeated
the
lord
promise
of
acceptance
at
the
hand
of
solomon
the
scriptural
record
runs
thus
so
david
prepared
abundantly
before
his
death
then
he
called
for
solomon
his
son
and
charged
him
to
build
an
house
for
the
lord
god
of
israel
and
david
said
to
solomon
my
son
as
for
me
it
was
in
my
mind
to
build
an
house
unto
the
name
of
the
lord
my
god
but
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
me
saying
thou
hast
shed
blood
abundantly
and
hast
made
great
wars
thou
shalt
not
build
an
house
unto
my
name
because
thou
hast
shed
much
blood
upon
the
earth
in
my
sight
behold
a
son
shall
be
born
to
thee
who
shall
be
a
man
of
rest
and
i
will
give
him
rest
from
all
his
enemies
round
about
for
his
name
shall
be
solomon
and
i
will
give
peace
and
quietness
unto
israel
in
his
days
he
shall
build
an
house
for
my
name
and
he
shall
be
my
son
and
i
will
be
his
father
and
i
will
establish
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
over
israel
for
ever
now
my
son
the
lord
be
with
thee
and
prosper
thou
and
build
the
house
of
the
lord
thy
god
as
he
hath
said
of
thee
only
the
lord
give
thee
wisdom
and
understanding
and
give
thee
charge
concerning
israel
that
thou
mayest
keep
the
law
of
the
lord
thy
god
then
shalt
thou
prosper
if
thou
takest
heed
to
fulfill
the
statues
and
judgments
which
the
lord
charged
moses
with
concerning
israel
be
strong
and
of
good
courage
dread
not
nor
be
dismayed
now
behold
in
my
trouble
i
have
prepared
for
the
house
of
the
lord
an
hundred
thousand
talents
of
gold
and
a
thousand
thousand
talents
of
silver
and
of
brass
and
iron
without
weight
for
it
is
in
abundance
timber
also
and
stone
have
i
prepared
and
thou
mayest
add
thereto
moreover
there
are
workmen
with
thee
in
abundance
hewers
and
workers
of
stone
and
timber
and
all
manner
of
cunning
men
for
every
manner
of
work
of
the
gold
the
silver
and
the
brass
and
the
iron
there
is
no
number
arise
therefore
and
be
doing
and
the
lord
be
with
thee
david
also
commanded
all
the
princes
of
israel
to
help
solomon
his
son
saying
is
not
the
lord
your
god
with
you
and
hath
he
not
given
you
rest
on
every
side
for
he
hath
given
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
into
mine
hand
and
the
land
is
subdued
before
the
lord
and
before
his
people
now
set
your
heart
and
your
soul
to
seek
the
lord
your
god
arise
therefore
and
build
ye
the
sanctuary
of
the
lord
god
to
bring
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
and
the
holy
vessels
of
god
into
the
house
that
is
to
be
built
to
the
name
of
the
lord
david
gave
solomon
detailed
instructions
as
to
the
design
and
specifications
of
the
house
and
its
appurtenances
the
plan
of
the
porch
and
that
of
both
the
main
structure
and
the
accessory
buildings
and
the
pattern
of
all
that
he
had
by
the
spirit
furthermore
he
gave
directions
as
to
the
ministry
of
the
various
courses
of
priests
and
levites
and
for
all
the
work
of
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
for
all
the
vessels
of
service
in
the
house
of
the
lord
the
actual
work
of
construction
was
begun
in
the
fourth
year
of
solomon
reign
and
the
temple
was
ready
for
dedication
in
the
twelfth
or
about
at
the
inception
of
the
labor
solomon
entered
into
an
agreement
with
hiram
a
neighboring
king
whereby
the
resources
of
tyre
and
sidon
were
annexed
in
the
great
undertaking
through
this
alliance
the
splendid
forests
of
lebanon
were
made
accessible
cedar
and
fir
and
other
trees
were
felled
and
floated
by
the
thousand
to
the
most
convenient
point
for
land
transportation
to
jerusalem
it
had
been
previously
explained
to
hiram
that
the
demand
would
be
a
heavy
one
for
as
solomon
had
said
the
house
which
i
build
is
great
for
great
is
our
god
above
all
gods
sidonian
hewers
were
put
to
work
the
most
skilful
of
all
known
woodmen
and
the
timbers
of
lebanon
were
supplied
in
abundance
the
extent
of
the
demand
may
be
judged
from
the
enormous
payment
proffered
and
made
by
solomon
israelitish
workmen
were
employed
in
great
numbers
both
in
with
the
sidonians
and
at
home
thus
we
read
and
king
solomon
raised
a
levy
out
of
all
israel
and
the
levy
was
thirty
thousand
men
and
he
sent
them
to
lebanon
ten
thousand
a
month
by
courses
a
month
they
were
in
lebanon
and
two
months
at
home
and
adoniram
was
over
the
levy
and
solomon
had
threescore
and
ten
thousand
that
bare
burdens
and
fourscore
thousand
hewers
in
the
mountains
beside
the
chief
of
solomon
officers
which
were
over
the
work
three
thousand
and
three
hundred
which
ruled
over
the
people
that
wrought
in
the
work
and
the
king
commanded
and
they
brought
great
stones
costly
stones
and
hewed
stones
to
lay
the
foundation
of
the
house
and
solomon
builders
and
hiram
builders
did
hew
them
and
the
stonesquarers
so
they
prepared
timber
and
stones
to
build
the
house
for
the
successful
employment
of
such
great
numbers
of
workmen
an
effective
system
of
organization
was
necessary
we
are
not
surprised
therefore
in
reading
that
hundred
overseers
were
in
service
the
efficiency
of
the
system
is
attested
by
the
success
attending
the
great
undertaking
the
israelites
and
the
men
of
tyre
and
sidon
worked
in
harmony
and
much
of
the
building
material
was
shaped
by
pattern
and
measurement
in
forest
and
quarry
therefore
the
house
when
it
was
in
building
was
built
of
stone
made
ready
before
it
was
brought
thither
so
that
there
was
neither
hammer
nor
ax
nor
any
tool
of
iron
heard
in
the
house
while
it
was
in
building
our
primary
source
of
information
relating
to
the
erection
of
the
great
temple
is
the
scriptural
record
contained
in
i
kings
chapters
and
a
later
account
appears
in
ii
chronicles
chapter
and
which
account
as
well
as
the
description
given
by
josephus
appears
to
have
been
derived
from
the
record
first
cited
in
general
the
design
of
solomon
temple
was
that
of
the
specially
constructed
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
though
the
dimensions
of
the
temple
were
double
those
of
the
tabernacle
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
porch
of
the
tabernacle
was
five
cubits
deep
that
of
the
temple
measured
ten
cubits
in
depth
in
each
case
the
porch
extended
across
the
full
width
of
the
house
the
holy
place
or
first
compartment
within
the
walls
was
twenty
cubits
long
ten
cubits
wide
and
ten
high
in
the
tabernacle
that
of
the
temple
was
forty
by
twenty
cubits
and
twenty
cubits
high
the
inner
sanctuary
oracle
or
holy
of
holies
in
the
tabernacle
was
cubical
and
measured
ten
cubits
each
way
in
the
temple
this
sacred
enclosure
was
a
cube
of
twenty
cubits
thus
the
ground
plan
of
the
tabernacle
covered
by
twenty
cubits
and
that
of
the
temple
seventy
cubits
by
forty
these
measurements
do
not
take
into
account
the
side
chambers
which
in
the
tabernacle
were
five
cubits
wide
those
connected
with
the
temple
measured
ten
cubits
in
extreme
width
with
these
included
the
entire
area
of
the
tabernacle
was
forty
by
twenty
cubits
and
that
of
the
temple
eighty
by
forty
cubits
or
at
the
usually
accepted
equivalent
for
the
cubit
sixty
by
thirty
feet
for
the
tabernacle
and
one
hundred
and
twenty
feet
by
sixty
feet
for
the
temple
in
height
the
same
relation
was
maintained
the
tabernacle
rose
fifteen
cubits
and
the
temple
thirty
cubits
the
temple
porch
appears
to
have
towered
above
the
height
of
the
main
structure
in
the
porch
standing
as
a
guard
at
the
threshold
of
the
temple
were
two
brazen
pillars
of
elaborate
design
and
doubtless
of
emblematical
significance
they
were
regarded
as
of
such
importance
as
to
merit
detailed
description
and
the
name
of
their
maker
was
inscribed
in
the
temple
archives
they
were
wrought
by
hiram
of
tyre
not
the
king
who
bore
the
same
name
but
a
skilled
in
the
working
of
brass
hiram
fashioned
the
pillars
each
twelve
cubits
in
circumference
and
eighteen
cubits
high
exclusive
of
the
massive
chapiters
which
were
ornamented
with
pomegranates
and
lily
work
the
pillar
at
the
right
of
the
entrance
was
named
jachin
meaning
he
shall
establish
and
that
at
the
left
was
called
boaz
signifying
in
it
is
strength
whatever
deeper
meaning
may
have
been
attached
to
these
massive
columns
their
suggestive
symbolism
of
strength
and
firmness
is
plainly
apparent
as
to
whether
they
actually
supported
the
roof
of
the
porch
or
were
free
standing
as
embellishments
and
symbols
alone
the
scriptural
text
is
not
definite
the
walls
of
the
great
temple
were
of
hewn
stone
yet
on
the
inside
no
stone
was
visible
for
the
walls
were
wainscotted
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
cedar
richly
decorated
with
carvings
of
flowers
trees
and
other
designs
and
the
flooring
was
of
fir
moreover
the
interior
was
richly
embellished
with
overlaid
work
in
pure
gold
the
partition
by
which
the
oracle
or
holy
of
holies
was
divided
off
corresponding
to
the
veil
in
the
tabernacle
was
thus
overlaid
and
was
hung
with
chains
of
gold
the
cherubim
that
stood
as
the
symbol
of
guardianship
over
the
oracle
were
of
olive
wood
covered
with
gold
the
precious
metal
being
fitted
upon
the
carved
work
the
vestibule
or
porch
stood
at
the
east
end
and
this
constituted
the
only
entrance
to
the
temple
proper
on
the
other
three
sides
therefore
surrounding
both
the
holy
place
and
the
oracle
were
numerous
small
chambers
built
in
three
tiers
or
stories
the
width
of
these
was
five
cubits
in
the
lowest
story
six
cubits
in
the
middle
and
seven
cubits
in
the
top
story
this
peculiarity
in
width
increasing
with
height
was
made
possible
by
the
decrease
in
the
thickness
of
the
walls
by
this
rebatement
of
the
walls
the
cedarn
chambers
were
well
supported
yet
they
formed
no
part
of
the
main
structure
it
was
so
designed
that
the
beams
should
not
be
fastened
in
the
walls
of
the
house
these
small
apartments
were
therefore
chambers
round
about
against
the
walls
of
the
house
yet
of
independent
construction
from
the
mention
made
by
ezekiel
these
chambers
are
supposed
to
have
numbered
thirty
though
no
precise
specification
is
found
they
were
probably
used
for
service
required
of
the
priests
aside
from
the
ceremonial
labor
connected
with
the
general
ritual
entrance
to
these
chambers
was
provided
on
the
right
side
of
the
building
with
winding
stairs
leading
to
the
upper
rooms
above
the
level
of
the
upper
chambers
were
windows
by
which
the
outer
apartment
or
holy
place
was
lighted
the
holy
of
holies
however
was
without
natural
light
the
furniture
within
the
temple
comprised
but
few
objects
yet
every
piece
was
of
special
design
and
for
exclusive
use
in
the
holy
place
stood
the
table
or
a
series
of
tables
to
bear
the
sacred
mention
is
made
also
of
an
altar
of
gold
and
of
ten
candlesticks
of
pure
gold
set
in
front
of
the
entrance
to
the
oracle
five
on
either
side
furthermore
there
were
tongs
of
gold
bowls
and
snuffers
basins
and
spoons
the
oracle
was
prepared
for
the
reception
of
the
ark
of
the
covenant
and
to
overshadow
that
holy
vessel
there
were
prepared
the
two
great
cherubim
each
ten
cubits
high
these
were
of
olive
wood
overlaid
with
gold
the
temple
stood
within
walled
enclosures
generally
spoken
of
as
outer
and
inner
courts
respectively
the
wall
of
the
inner
court
is
described
as
consisting
of
three
courses
of
hewn
stone
in
which
was
set
a
course
of
cedar
beams
this
corresponded
to
the
single
enclosure
of
the
ancient
tabernacle
inasmuch
as
all
the
specified
measurements
show
the
temple
to
have
been
double
the
size
of
the
tabernacle
this
court
may
have
been
of
corresponding
proportion
it
is
therefore
generally
believed
to
have
extended
one
hundred
cubits
north
and
south
and
two
hundred
cubits
east
and
west
within
the
court
before
the
porch
of
the
lord
stood
the
altar
of
sacrifice
this
was
of
brass
twenty
cubits
square
and
ten
cubits
high
to
the
service
of
the
altar
belonged
many
of
the
utensils
such
as
basins
pots
and
shovels
specially
made
under
the
direction
of
the
master
craftsman
hiram
of
tyre
another
prominent
object
within
the
court
was
the
molten
sea
called
also
the
brazen
sea
this
great
font
measured
thirty
cubits
in
circumference
and
stood
five
cubits
high
and
was
richly
ornamented
the
walls
were
a
in
thickness
and
the
brim
was
embellished
with
flower
work
it
was
mounted
on
twelve
brazen
oxen
arranged
in
groups
of
three
the
groups
facing
respectively
north
south
east
and
west
the
great
font
stood
between
the
altar
and
the
porch
on
the
right
side
of
the
house
eastward
over
against
the
south
associated
with
the
molten
sea
were
ten
smaller
vessels
called
lavers
mounted
on
bases
of
special
construction
and
provided
with
wheels
to
facilitate
removal
the
lavers
were
used
in
connection
with
the
service
of
the
altar
for
the
washing
of
the
offerings
but
the
main
font
or
molten
sea
was
reserved
for
the
ceremonial
cleansing
of
the
priests
when
the
house
of
the
lord
was
completed
elaborate
preparations
were
made
for
its
dedication
first
came
the
installation
of
the
ark
of
the
covenant
and
its
appurtenances
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
the
holy
vessels
with
great
solemnity
and
to
the
accompaniment
of
ceremonial
sacrifice
the
ark
was
brought
by
the
priests
and
placed
within
the
holy
of
holies
beneath
the
wings
of
the
cherubim
at
this
time
the
ark
contained
only
the
two
tables
of
stone
which
moses
put
there
the
staves
by
which
the
ark
was
borne
were
so
drawn
out
as
to
be
visible
from
within
the
holy
place
and
then
it
came
to
pass
when
the
priests
were
come
out
of
the
holy
place
that
the
cloud
filled
the
house
of
the
lord
so
that
the
priests
could
not
stand
to
minister
because
of
the
cloud
for
the
glory
of
the
lord
had
filled
the
house
of
the
lord
then
solomon
addressed
the
assembled
multitude
reciting
the
circumstances
under
which
the
building
of
the
temple
had
been
conceived
by
his
father
david
and
executed
by
himself
and
proclaiming
the
mercy
and
goodness
of
israel
god
standing
before
the
altar
of
the
lord
in
the
court
of
the
temple
the
king
spread
forth
his
hands
toward
heaven
and
offered
the
dedicatory
prayer
the
king
then
blessed
the
people
saying
blessed
be
the
lord
that
hath
given
rest
unto
his
people
israel
according
to
all
that
he
promised
there
hath
not
failed
one
word
of
all
his
good
promise
which
he
promised
by
the
hand
of
moses
his
servant
the
lord
our
god
be
with
us
as
he
was
with
our
fathers
let
him
not
leave
us
nor
forsake
us
the
principal
services
with
the
attendant
festivities
lasted
seven
days
and
on
the
eighth
day
he
sent
the
people
away
and
they
blessed
the
king
and
went
unto
their
tents
joyful
and
glad
of
heart
for
all
the
goodness
that
the
lord
had
done
for
david
his
servant
and
for
israel
his
people
for
only
a
third
of
a
century
did
this
splendid
edifice
maintain
its
supremacy
and
glory
in
the
later
years
of
his
reign
solomon
had
done
wickedly
in
the
sight
of
god
and
the
people
had
not
been
slow
to
follow
their
king
in
evil
paths
israel
had
grown
weak
in
their
allegiance
to
jehovah
and
had
gone
after
strange
gods
following
the
death
of
solomon
the
nation
was
disrupted
in
the
fifth
year
of
the
reign
of
rehoboam
shishak
king
of
egypt
besieged
the
city
of
david
and
even
despoiled
the
temple
and
carried
away
part
of
the
sacred
treasures
next
jehoash
king
of
one
part
of
the
divided
nation
took
away
gold
and
silver
and
sacred
vessels
from
the
house
of
the
lord
and
carried
them
into
samaria
it
is
thus
shown
that
the
desecration
of
the
temple
was
not
effected
wholly
by
the
enemies
of
israel
the
people
to
whom
the
house
had
once
been
sacred
contributed
to
its
profanation
ahaz
the
wicked
king
of
judah
removed
the
altar
from
its
place
and
substituted
therefore
another
fashioned
by
his
own
order
after
the
pattern
of
the
altars
of
the
heathen
moreover
he
took
down
the
molten
sea
and
dismantled
the
lavers
mannasseh
another
evil
king
who
reigned
in
judah
followed
after
baal
and
set
up
idolatrous
shrines
within
the
very
precincts
of
the
temple
the
precious
things
of
the
house
of
the
lord
were
used
as
barter
between
kings
so
asa
king
of
judah
purchased
the
aid
of
to
fight
against
israel
so
also
did
jehoash
purchase
peace
from
hazael
king
of
syria
and
so
did
hezekiah
strip
the
house
of
the
lord
for
plunder
wherewith
to
pay
tribute
to
the
assyrians
some
attempts
were
made
to
repair
the
worst
of
the
ravages
upon
and
within
the
temple
but
it
seemed
that
the
house
had
been
abandoned
to
its
fate
in
the
year
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
completed
the
destruction
of
the
temple
in
connection
with
his
conquest
of
the
kingdom
of
judah
whatever
of
value
was
yet
there
he
carried
away
and
the
building
was
destroyed
by
fire
there
occurs
yet
one
later
mention
of
some
of
the
vessels
that
had
been
made
for
the
service
of
jehovah
when
they
were
brought
out
to
crown
the
triumph
of
belshazzar
in
his
heathenish
feast
then
was
manifest
the
displeasure
of
the
lord
and
the
trembling
king
heard
from
the
lips
of
daniel
his
doom
for
he
had
been
unmindful
of
the
fate
that
had
overtaken
his
father
and
had
lifted
up
himself
against
the
lord
of
heaven
and
had
brought
out
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
god
that
he
and
his
lords
his
wives
and
his
concubines
might
drink
wine
therefrom
and
he
had
praised
the
gods
of
silver
and
gold
of
brass
iron
wood
and
stone
which
see
not
nor
hear
nor
know
but
the
god
in
whose
hand
was
his
breath
and
whose
were
all
his
ways
had
he
not
glorified
he
had
been
weighed
in
the
balances
and
was
found
wanting
and
his
kingdom
was
taken
from
him
that
night
belshazzar
the
king
was
slain
the
temple
of
ezekiel
vision
in
the
year
of
the
babylonian
captivity
while
yet
the
people
of
israel
were
in
exile
in
a
strange
land
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
the
prophet
ezekiel
the
power
of
god
rested
upon
him
and
he
saw
in
vision
a
glorious
temple
the
plan
of
which
he
minutely
described
as
to
whether
the
prophet
himself
considered
the
design
so
shown
as
one
to
be
subsequently
realized
or
as
but
a
grand
yet
unattainable
ideal
is
not
declared
certain
it
is
that
the
temple
of
the
vision
has
not
yet
been
builded
in
most
of
its
essential
features
ezekiel
ideal
followed
closely
the
plan
of
solomon
temple
so
close
indeed
is
the
resemblance
that
many
of
the
details
specified
by
ezekiel
have
been
accepted
as
those
of
the
splendid
edifice
destroyed
by
nebuchadnezzar
a
predominant
characteristic
of
the
temple
described
by
ezekiel
was
the
spaciousness
of
its
premises
and
the
symmetry
of
both
the
holy
house
and
its
associated
buildings
the
area
was
to
be
a
square
of
five
hundred
cubits
walled
about
and
provided
with
a
gateway
and
arches
on
each
of
three
sides
on
the
west
side
the
wall
was
to
be
unbroken
by
arch
or
portal
at
each
of
the
gateways
were
little
chambers
regarded
as
lodges
and
provided
with
porches
in
the
outer
court
were
other
chambers
the
entire
area
was
to
be
elevated
and
a
flight
of
steps
led
to
each
gateway
in
the
inner
court
was
seen
the
great
altar
standing
before
the
house
and
occupying
the
center
of
a
square
of
one
hundred
cubits
ample
provision
was
made
for
every
variety
of
sacrifice
and
offering
and
for
the
accommodation
of
the
priests
the
singers
and
all
engaged
in
the
holy
ritual
the
main
structure
comprised
a
porch
a
holy
place
and
an
inner
sanctuary
or
most
holy
place
the
last
named
elevated
above
the
rest
and
reached
by
steps
the
plan
provided
for
even
greater
exclusiveness
than
had
characterized
the
sacred
area
of
the
temple
of
solomon
the
double
courts
contributed
to
this
end
the
service
of
the
temple
was
prescribed
in
detail
the
ordinances
of
the
altar
the
duties
of
the
priests
the
ministry
of
the
levites
the
regulations
governing
oblations
and
feasts
were
all
set
forth
the
immediate
purpose
of
this
revelation
through
the
vision
of
the
prophet
appears
to
have
been
that
of
awakening
the
people
of
israel
to
a
realization
of
their
fallen
state
and
a
conception
of
their
departed
glory
the
prophet
was
thus
commanded
thou
son
of
man
shew
the
house
to
the
house
of
israel
that
they
may
be
ashamed
of
their
iniquities
and
let
them
measure
the
pattern
and
if
they
be
ashamed
of
all
that
they
have
done
show
them
the
form
of
the
house
and
the
fashion
thereof
and
the
goings
out
thereof
and
the
comings
in
thereof
and
all
the
forms
thereof
and
all
the
ordinances
thereof
and
all
the
forms
thereof
and
all
the
laws
thereof
and
write
it
in
their
sight
that
they
may
keep
the
whole
form
thereof
and
all
the
ordinances
thereof
and
do
them
this
is
the
law
of
the
house
upon
the
top
of
the
mountain
the
whole
limit
thereof
round
about
shall
be
most
holy
behold
this
is
the
law
of
the
house
the
temple
of
zerubbabel
for
three
score
years
and
ten
the
jews
had
grieved
and
groaned
under
babylonian
rule
the
greater
part
of
the
once
proud
kingdom
of
judah
had
been
carried
away
captive
and
such
as
remained
in
the
land
of
their
fathers
had
lost
their
national
status
and
had
become
largely
merged
with
the
gentiles
with
dreadful
exactness
had
been
fulfilled
the
dire
prediction
of
jeremiah
through
that
prophet
the
lord
had
spoken
saying
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
because
ye
have
not
heard
my
words
behold
i
will
send
and
take
all
the
families
of
the
north
saith
the
lord
and
nebuchadrezzar
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
babylon
my
servant
and
will
bring
them
against
this
land
and
against
the
inhabitants
thereof
and
against
all
these
nations
around
about
and
will
utterly
destroy
them
and
make
them
an
astonishment
and
an
hissing
and
perpetual
desolations
moreover
i
will
take
from
them
the
voice
of
mirth
and
the
voice
of
gladness
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
voice
of
the
bride
the
sound
of
the
millstones
and
the
light
of
the
candle
and
this
whole
land
shall
be
a
desolation
and
an
astonishment
and
these
nations
shall
serve
the
king
of
babylon
seventy
years
however
the
gloom
of
the
saddening
prophecy
had
been
lightened
by
one
ray
of
hope
and
promise
the
assurance
that
when
the
seventy
years
of
the
lord
chastisement
had
been
completed
the
people
should
return
to
the
land
of
their
inheritance
and
once
again
be
recognized
as
the
lord
own
in
the
encouragement
of
that
hope
the
people
had
lived
by
its
inspiration
their
prophets
even
while
in
captivity
had
sought
the
lord
and
declared
his
will
to
the
people
by
its
light
ezekiel
had
seen
in
the
vision
of
seership
the
of
his
people
and
the
possibility
of
a
temple
greater
and
grander
than
the
first
in
due
time
the
god
of
israel
made
good
his
word
and
vindicated
anew
his
power
as
king
of
kings
he
ruled
and
overruled
the
passions
of
nations
and
the
acts
of
earthly
rulers
and
once
again
brought
his
people
from
the
land
of
their
bondage
persia
had
become
the
controlling
power
among
the
nations
and
by
decree
of
the
persian
king
judah
was
emancipated
behold
the
power
of
god
in
directing
the
rulers
among
mortals
now
in
the
first
year
of
cyrus
king
of
persia
that
the
word
of
the
lord
by
the
mouth
of
jeremiah
might
be
fulfilled
the
lord
stirred
up
the
spirit
of
cyrus
king
of
persia
that
he
made
a
proclamation
throughout
all
his
kingdom
and
put
it
also
in
writing
saying
thus
saith
cyrus
king
of
persia
the
lord
god
of
heaven
hath
given
me
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
and
he
hath
charged
me
to
build
him
an
house
at
jerusalem
which
is
in
judah
who
is
there
among
you
of
all
his
people
his
god
be
with
him
and
let
him
go
up
to
jerusalem
which
is
in
judah
and
build
the
house
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
he
is
the
god
which
is
in
jerusalem
and
whosoever
remaineth
in
any
place
where
he
sojourneth
let
the
men
of
his
place
help
him
with
silver
and
with
gold
and
with
goods
and
with
beasts
beside
the
freewill
offering
for
the
house
of
god
that
is
in
jerusalem
under
this
gracious
permission
the
people
returned
to
the
land
of
their
fathers
and
set
about
the
work
of
building
anew
a
house
to
the
lord
cyrus
had
issued
his
royal
decree
that
the
structure
be
worthy
the
great
name
to
which
it
was
to
be
reared
the
foundations
were
to
be
strongly
laid
the
height
was
to
be
three
score
cubits
and
the
breadth
the
same
there
were
to
be
set
three
rows
of
great
stones
and
a
row
of
new
timber
moreover
the
expenses
were
to
be
met
by
the
royal
treasury
the
king
restored
to
the
people
the
vessels
that
had
been
taken
by
nebuchadnezzar
from
the
first
temple
all
these
numbering
many
thousands
were
formally
delivered
by
the
king
treasurer
so
great
was
the
enthusiasm
of
the
people
so
strong
their
desire
to
have
individual
part
in
the
holy
undertaking
that
many
who
had
been
careless
of
their
heritage
now
claimed
priestly
standing
but
as
their
genealogy
had
not
been
preserved
they
were
debarred
from
the
priesthood
though
permitted
to
return
with
the
rest
the
prerogatives
of
the
priestly
order
were
denied
them
until
one
would
arise
with
power
to
declare
their
genealogy
through
urim
and
thummim
zerubbabel
and
jeshua
had
charge
of
the
work
and
without
delay
they
builded
anew
the
altar
of
the
god
of
israel
and
the
ritual
of
sacrifice
and
the
observance
of
the
sacred
festivals
masons
and
carpenters
workmen
and
artisans
of
all
kinds
and
degrees
were
brought
into
service
again
were
tyre
and
sidon
put
under
friendly
tribute
and
once
more
the
wealth
of
the
forests
of
lebanon
was
brought
to
jerusalem
priests
and
levites
were
marshalled
in
order
as
of
old
and
the
sound
of
trumpets
and
cymbals
was
mingled
with
the
voices
of
the
singers
is
there
cause
for
wonder
that
as
the
foundations
were
laid
old
men
who
remembered
the
first
house
and
its
glory
wept
aloud
and
shouted
in
their
tearful
joy
but
adversaries
arose
who
put
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
builders
the
people
of
canaan
israelites
who
had
forgotten
their
allegiance
to
god
and
had
mingled
with
idolaters
took
offense
at
the
activity
of
the
returned
jews
at
first
they
offered
to
assist
in
the
work
but
being
refused
recognition
because
of
their
idolatrous
associations
they
became
obstructionists
and
weakened
the
hands
of
the
people
of
judah
and
troubled
them
in
building
and
hired
counsellors
against
them
to
frustrate
their
purpose
all
the
days
of
cyrus
king
of
persia
even
until
the
reign
of
darius
king
of
persia
the
claim
was
made
that
of
old
the
people
of
judah
had
been
a
trouble
to
other
nations
and
that
with
the
restoration
of
their
temple
they
would
again
become
seditious
at
last
the
protests
and
charges
reached
darius
the
reigning
monarch
and
he
having
investigated
the
whole
matter
issued
a
decree
that
not
only
should
the
jews
be
free
from
interruption
in
the
building
of
the
temple
but
that
a
portion
of
the
king
tribute
the
regular
taxes
of
the
land
should
be
devoted
to
the
work
and
said
the
king
also
i
have
made
a
decree
that
whosoever
shall
alter
this
word
let
timber
be
pulled
down
from
his
house
and
being
set
up
let
him
be
hanged
thereon
and
let
his
house
be
made
a
dunghill
for
this
and
the
god
that
hath
caused
his
name
to
dwell
there
destroy
all
kings
and
people
that
shall
put
to
their
hand
to
alter
and
to
destroy
this
house
of
god
which
is
at
jerusalem
i
darius
have
made
a
decree
let
it
be
done
with
speed
with
such
support
the
people
soon
completed
the
building
though
nearly
twenty
years
elapsed
between
the
laying
of
the
foundation
and
the
finishing
the
greater
part
of
the
labor
was
done
during
the
last
four
years
the
dedicatory
services
were
solemn
and
inspiring
for
seven
days
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
was
observed
the
passover
was
eaten
by
those
who
had
returned
from
captivity
and
by
such
others
as
had
separated
themselves
unto
them
from
the
filthiness
of
the
heathen
of
the
land
to
seek
the
lord
god
of
israel
this
the
second
temple
was
finished
in
the
year
it
is
known
in
history
as
the
temple
of
zerubbabel
in
general
plan
it
was
patterned
after
the
temple
of
solomon
though
in
many
of
its
dimensions
it
exceeded
its
prototype
the
court
was
divided
into
a
section
for
priests
only
and
another
for
the
public
according
to
josephus
the
division
was
effected
by
a
wooden
railing
an
alter
of
unhewn
stone
was
erected
in
place
of
the
great
brazen
alter
of
old
the
holy
place
was
graced
by
but
one
candlestick
instead
of
ten
and
by
a
single
table
for
the
instead
of
the
ten
tables
overlaid
with
gold
which
stood
in
the
first
temple
we
read
also
of
a
golden
altar
of
incense
and
of
some
minor
appurtenances
the
most
holy
place
was
empty
for
the
ark
of
the
covenant
had
not
been
known
after
the
people
had
gone
into
captivity
in
many
respects
the
temple
of
zerubbabel
appeared
poor
in
comparison
with
its
splendid
predecessor
and
in
certain
particulars
indeed
it
ranked
lower
than
the
ancient
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
the
sanctuary
of
the
nomadic
tribes
critical
scholars
specify
the
following
features
characteristic
of
the
temple
of
solomon
and
lacking
in
the
temple
of
zerubbabel
the
ark
of
the
covenant
the
sacred
fire
the
shekinah
or
glory
of
the
lord
manifested
of
old
as
the
divine
presence
the
urim
and
thummim
by
which
jehovah
made
plain
his
will
to
the
priests
of
the
aaronic
order
the
genius
or
spirit
of
prophecy
indicative
of
the
closest
communion
between
mortals
and
their
god
notwithstanding
these
differences
the
temple
of
zerubbabel
was
recognized
of
god
and
was
undoubtedly
the
site
or
seat
of
divine
revelation
to
duly
constituted
prophets
the
inferiority
of
the
second
temple
as
compared
with
the
first
is
generally
conceded
the
difference
however
was
rather
in
matter
of
splendor
than
in
point
of
size
but
even
such
glory
as
it
did
possess
was
not
to
be
long
maintained
again
the
people
became
recreant
to
their
god
and
the
voice
of
the
prophet
was
unheeded
again
did
jehovah
permit
the
heathen
to
oppress
judah
of
the
later
history
of
this
temple
the
biblical
record
gives
but
few
details
but
from
other
sources
we
learn
of
its
vicissitudes
in
connection
with
the
maccabean
persecution
the
house
of
the
lord
was
profaned
a
syrian
king
antiochus
epiphanes
captured
jerusalem
to
and
perpetrated
blasphemous
outrage
against
the
religion
of
the
people
he
plundered
the
temple
and
carried
away
its
golden
candlestick
its
golden
altar
of
incense
its
table
of
shewbread
and
even
tore
down
the
sacred
veils
which
were
of
fine
linen
and
scarlet
his
malignity
was
carried
so
far
that
he
purposely
desecrated
the
altar
of
sacrifice
by
offering
swine
thereon
and
erected
a
heathen
altar
within
the
sacred
enclosure
not
content
with
the
violation
of
the
temple
this
wicked
monarch
had
altars
erected
in
the
towns
and
ordered
the
offering
of
unclean
beasts
upon
them
the
rite
of
circumcision
was
forbidden
on
pain
of
death
and
the
worship
of
jehovah
was
declared
a
crime
as
a
result
of
this
persecution
many
of
the
jews
apostatized
and
declared
that
they
belonged
to
the
medes
and
persians
the
nations
from
whose
dominion
they
had
been
delivered
by
the
power
of
god
among
those
who
remained
true
to
the
religion
of
their
fathers
was
mattathias
who
was
a
priest
and
a
man
of
prominence
he
was
besought
to
offer
heathen
sacrifice
not
only
did
he
refuse
but
in
righteous
indignation
he
slew
those
who
did
attempt
the
sacrilege
this
act
led
to
further
strife
and
for
three
years
the
struggle
continued
judas
son
of
mattathias
came
into
prominence
and
is
known
as
judas
maccabeus
the
first
of
the
maccabees
under
his
leadership
the
people
returned
to
jerusalem
and
found
the
temple
deserted
as
it
had
been
left
by
the
army
of
antiochus
its
gates
had
been
broken
down
and
burned
and
within
the
walls
weeds
were
growing
judas
tried
to
cleanse
and
rehabilitate
the
house
he
brought
in
new
vessels
and
replaced
the
candlestick
the
altar
of
incense
the
table
of
shewbread
and
the
veils
and
built
a
new
altar
for
burnt
offerings
then
in
the
year
the
house
was
rededicated
and
the
occasion
was
remembered
in
annual
festival
thereafter
under
the
name
of
the
feast
of
dedication
in
the
interest
of
the
jews
entered
into
an
alliance
with
the
romans
who
eventually
became
their
masters
during
the
reign
of
the
maccabees
the
temple
fell
into
decay
and
when
the
last
of
that
dynasty
had
been
succeeded
by
herod
the
great
the
house
was
little
more
than
a
ruin
nevertheless
the
priestly
orders
had
been
maintained
and
some
semblance
of
ritualistic
worship
had
continued
the
history
of
the
temple
of
zerubbabel
is
merged
with
that
of
the
temple
of
herod
the
temple
of
herod
in
the
year
herod
i
known
in
history
as
herod
the
great
was
established
on
the
throne
as
king
of
judea
he
had
already
served
successively
as
procurator
and
tetrarch
and
indeed
had
been
king
in
name
for
some
time
prior
to
his
enthronement
during
which
period
he
had
been
in
hostile
conflict
with
the
people
over
whom
the
decree
of
the
roman
senate
had
made
him
ruler
he
came
to
the
throne
noted
for
arrogance
and
cruelty
and
his
reign
was
one
of
tyranny
in
which
even
family
relationship
and
the
closest
ties
of
blood
proved
unavailing
to
protect
the
victims
of
his
displeasure
in
the
early
part
of
his
reign
he
put
to
death
nearly
all
the
members
of
the
sanhedrin
the
great
jewish
council
and
throughout
he
ruled
with
increasing
severity
nevertheless
he
was
successful
in
maintaining
peace
with
other
governments
and
by
his
roman
masters
was
accounted
an
able
ruler
among
his
acts
of
cruelty
was
the
slaughter
of
the
babes
of
bethlehem
a
murder
planned
and
executed
in
the
hope
of
including
among
the
victims
the
child
jesus
such
is
the
character
of
the
man
who
proposed
to
replace
the
temple
of
zerubbabel
by
a
new
and
more
splendid
structure
can
it
be
thought
that
a
proffered
gift
from
such
a
donor
could
be
acceptable
to
the
lord
david
had
aforetime
offered
to
build
a
house
to
the
lord
but
had
been
restrained
for
he
was
a
man
of
blood
herod
purpose
in
the
great
undertaking
was
that
of
aggrandizing
himself
and
the
nation
rather
than
the
rendering
of
homage
to
jehovah
his
proposition
to
rebuild
or
restore
the
temple
on
a
scale
of
increased
magnificence
was
regarded
with
suspicion
and
received
with
disfavor
by
the
jews
who
feared
that
were
the
ancient
edifice
demolished
the
arbitrary
monarch
might
abandon
his
plan
and
the
people
would
be
left
without
a
temple
to
allay
these
fears
the
king
proceeded
to
reconstruct
and
restore
the
old
edifice
part
by
part
directing
the
work
so
that
at
no
time
was
the
temple
service
seriously
interrupted
so
little
of
the
ancient
structure
was
allowed
to
stand
however
that
the
temple
of
herod
must
be
regarded
as
a
new
creation
the
work
was
begun
about
sixteen
years
before
the
birth
of
christ
and
while
the
holy
house
itself
was
practically
completed
within
a
year
and
a
half
this
part
of
the
labor
having
been
performed
by
a
body
of
one
thousand
priests
specially
trained
for
the
purpose
the
temple
area
was
a
scene
of
uninterrupted
building
operations
down
to
the
year
we
read
that
in
the
time
of
christ
ministry
the
temple
had
been
years
in
building
and
at
that
time
it
was
unfinished
the
biblical
record
gives
us
little
information
regarding
this
the
last
and
the
greatest
of
ancient
temples
for
what
we
know
concerning
it
we
are
indebted
mainly
to
josephus
with
some
corroborative
testimony
found
in
the
talmud
in
all
essentials
the
holy
house
or
temple
proper
was
similar
to
the
two
earlier
houses
of
sanctuary
though
externally
far
more
elaborate
and
imposing
than
either
but
in
the
matter
of
surrounding
courts
and
associated
buildings
the
temple
of
herod
preeminently
excelled
in
proceeding
from
the
outer
wall
to
the
innermost
enclosure
occupied
by
the
holy
house
one
would
traverse
successive
courts
each
at
a
higher
level
than
the
last
to
which
arrangement
the
slopes
of
mount
moriah
were
favorable
the
courts
extended
as
enormous
supported
by
foundations
of
massive
masonry
which
rose
vertically
in
some
places
seven
hundred
feet
from
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
outer
wall
enclosing
the
entire
temple
area
which
approximated
the
form
of
a
square
measured
four
hundred
cubits
or
one
stadium
about
six
hundred
feet
along
each
side
the
east
wall
constituting
the
principal
defense
of
the
city
on
that
side
was
unbroken
by
gates
on
each
of
the
other
three
sides
one
or
more
large
and
beautiful
portals
afforded
passage
through
the
wall
the
four
sides
of
the
great
enclosure
immediately
within
the
outer
wall
were
occupied
by
a
series
of
magnificent
porticoes
of
grecian
design
forming
a
covered
colonnade
in
which
every
pillar
was
a
massive
monolith
of
white
marble
this
colonnade
was
interrupted
at
the
corner
where
the
continuity
of
the
wall
was
broken
by
the
tower
of
antonia
in
reality
a
fortified
castle
from
which
a
subterranean
passage
led
into
the
inner
enclosure
where
stood
the
holy
house
the
colonnade
or
line
of
porticoes
along
the
south
side
was
particularly
elaborate
and
was
known
as
the
royal
porch
here
were
four
rows
of
huge
columns
and
consequently
three
corridors
of
which
the
inner
was
feet
wide
and
one
hundred
feet
high
while
each
of
the
side
corridors
measured
thirty
feet
in
width
and
sixty
feet
in
height
the
imposing
effect
of
the
royal
porch
is
dwelt
upon
by
josephus
who
states
that
its
beauty
was
incredible
to
those
who
had
not
seen
it
and
amazing
to
those
who
beheld
the
east
colonnade
or
row
of
porticoes
was
known
as
porch
the
name
having
reference
to
a
tradition
that
the
porch
covered
and
included
part
of
the
original
wall
erected
by
the
builder
of
the
first
temple
within
the
colonnade
was
a
spacious
area
to
which
general
admission
was
allowed
this
was
the
court
of
the
gentiles
it
was
in
this
court
that
and
traffickers
in
animals
used
for
sacrifice
had
established
their
stalls
at
the
time
of
our
ministry
and
from
which
they
were
expelled
through
his
righteous
indignation
the
while
he
declared
it
is
written
my
house
shall
be
called
the
house
of
prayer
but
ye
have
made
it
a
den
of
thieves
between
the
court
of
the
gentiles
and
the
inner
courts
rose
a
wall
cubits
high
this
marked
the
boundary
of
the
more
sacred
precincts
within
which
no
gentile
could
be
lawfully
admitted
at
intervals
along
the
wall
were
inscription
tablets
warning
all
who
were
not
of
israel
to
enter
not
on
pain
of
death
a
literal
translation
of
such
inscription
reads
let
no
alien
enter
within
the
balustrade
and
embankment
about
the
sanctuary
whoever
is
caught
makes
himself
responsible
for
his
death
which
will
follow
the
inner
courts
were
accessible
from
the
court
of
the
gentiles
through
nine
gates
of
which
one
was
on
the
east
and
four
were
on
the
north
and
south
respectively
as
in
the
earlier
temples
the
west
wall
was
without
a
gate
of
these
portals
the
principal
one
was
on
the
east
this
was
an
elaborate
structure
built
of
the
costly
corinthian
brass
and
known
as
the
corinthian
gate
though
sometimes
called
from
the
name
of
its
donor
the
gate
of
nicanor
furthermore
this
is
held
by
many
authorities
to
be
the
beautiful
gate
before
which
sat
the
lame
man
who
was
healed
through
the
ministrations
of
peter
and
john
part
of
the
space
within
the
inner
courts
was
open
to
israelites
of
both
sexes
and
was
known
distinctively
as
the
court
of
the
women
this
was
a
colonnaded
enclosure
and
constituted
the
place
of
general
assembly
in
the
prescribed
course
of
public
worship
chambers
used
for
ceremonial
purposes
occupied
the
four
corners
of
this
court
and
between
these
and
the
houses
at
the
gates
were
other
buildings
of
which
one
series
constituted
the
treasury
wherein
were
set
receptacles
for
gifts
beyond
the
court
of
the
women
and
really
a
continuation
thereof
was
a
section
sufficiently
described
by
its
name
the
court
of
the
men
these
two
courts
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
one
and
designated
the
court
of
israel
within
this
court
were
numerous
buildings
reserved
for
the
storage
of
sacred
things
or
devoted
to
special
assemblies
within
and
above
the
court
of
israel
was
the
court
of
the
priests
wherein
was
placed
the
great
altar
of
sacrifice
and
to
which
were
admitted
none
but
duly
appointed
priests
and
laymen
who
came
to
make
offerings
the
altar
was
a
large
structure
of
unhewn
stones
feet
square
at
the
base
and
diminishing
upward
to
the
hearth
which
was
a
square
of
feet
the
inclined
way
of
approach
was
on
the
south
side
a
laver
or
font
reserved
for
the
prescribed
ablutions
of
the
officiating
priests
stood
nearby
on
the
west
within
the
court
of
the
priests
on
an
elevation
reached
by
twelve
steps
stood
the
holy
house
the
temple
itself
in
comparison
with
its
many
and
massive
outliers
this
was
a
small
edifice
but
in
the
architectural
plan
it
was
made
the
most
impressive
if
not
the
most
imposing
feature
of
the
whole
it
has
been
properly
described
as
a
glittering
mass
of
white
marble
and
gold
like
the
earlier
temples
this
comprised
porch
holy
place
and
most
holy
place
or
holy
of
holies
the
porch
measured
one
hundred
cubits
both
in
width
and
height
the
holy
place
was
forty
by
twenty
cubits
as
in
the
temple
of
zerubbabel
but
its
height
was
increased
to
forty
cubits
by
adding
side
chambers
with
a
passage
between
them
and
the
main
building
herod
made
the
new
temple
greater
and
grander
than
either
of
its
predecessors
the
holy
of
holies
retained
the
original
form
and
dimensions
making
it
a
cube
twenty
cubits
in
each
measurement
between
this
and
the
holy
place
hung
a
double
veil
of
finest
material
elaborately
embroidered
the
outer
of
the
two
veils
was
open
at
the
north
end
the
inner
at
the
south
so
that
the
high
priest
who
entered
at
the
appointed
time
once
a
year
could
pass
between
the
veils
without
exposing
the
holy
of
holies
the
sacred
chamber
was
empty
save
for
a
large
stone
upon
which
the
high
priest
sprinkled
the
sacrificial
blood
on
the
day
of
atonement
this
stone
occupied
the
place
of
the
ark
and
its
mercy
seat
outside
the
veil
in
the
holy
place
stood
the
altar
of
incense
the
and
the
table
of
shewbread
that
the
temple
of
herod
was
by
far
the
grandest
structure
ever
erected
as
a
temple
in
any
age
is
generally
admitted
yet
its
beauty
and
grandeur
lay
in
architectural
excellence
rather
than
in
the
sanctity
of
its
worship
or
in
the
manifestation
of
the
divine
presence
within
its
walls
its
ritual
and
service
were
largely
for
while
the
letter
of
the
mosaic
law
was
professedly
observed
the
law
had
been
supplemented
and
in
many
features
supplanted
by
rule
and
priestly
prescription
the
jews
professed
to
consider
it
holy
and
by
them
it
was
proclaimed
as
the
house
of
the
lord
devoid
though
it
was
of
the
divine
accompaniments
of
earlier
shrines
accepted
of
god
and
defiled
as
it
was
by
priestly
arrogance
and
usurpation
as
also
by
the
selfish
interest
of
traffic
and
trade
it
was
nevertheless
recognized
even
by
our
lord
the
christ
as
his
father
house
therein
the
boy
jesus
was
presented
as
required
by
the
law
thereto
came
he
with
his
people
at
the
time
of
the
passover
within
its
precincts
he
declared
himself
and
the
father
who
sent
him
when
at
last
rejected
by
his
own
and
by
them
brought
to
the
cross
he
wrought
the
sacrifice
through
which
salvation
was
made
possible
to
man
the
veil
of
the
temple
was
rent
by
an
unseen
power
and
the
last
vestige
of
supreme
sanctity
departed
from
the
place
as
long
as
it
stood
however
the
temple
was
held
by
the
jews
in
high
veneration
an
utterance
of
the
savior
construed
by
the
as
an
aspersion
upon
the
temple
was
used
against
him
as
one
of
the
chief
accusations
on
which
his
death
was
demanded
when
the
jews
clamored
for
a
sign
of
his
authority
he
predicted
his
own
death
and
subsequent
resurrection
saying
destroy
this
temple
and
in
three
days
i
will
raise
it
up
they
blindly
regarded
this
remark
as
a
disrespectful
allusion
to
their
temple
a
structure
built
by
human
hands
and
they
refused
to
forget
or
forgive
that
this
veneration
continued
after
the
crucifixion
of
our
lord
is
evident
from
accusations
brought
against
stephen
and
still
later
against
paul
in
their
murderous
rage
the
people
accused
stephen
of
disrespect
for
the
temple
and
brought
false
witnesses
who
uttered
perjured
testimony
saying
this
man
ceaseth
not
to
speak
blasphemous
words
against
this
holy
place
and
stephen
was
numbered
with
the
martyrs
when
it
was
claimed
that
paul
had
brought
with
him
into
the
temple
precincts
a
gentile
the
whole
city
was
aroused
and
the
infuriated
mob
dragged
paul
from
the
place
and
sought
to
kill
him
for
thirty
or
more
years
after
the
death
of
christ
the
jews
continued
the
work
of
adding
to
and
embellishing
the
temple
buildings
the
elaborate
design
conceived
and
projected
by
herod
had
been
practically
completed
the
temple
was
finished
and
as
soon
afterward
appeared
was
ready
for
destruction
its
fate
had
been
definitely
foretold
by
the
savior
himself
commenting
on
a
remark
by
one
of
the
disciples
concerning
the
great
stones
and
the
splendid
buildings
on
the
temple
hill
jesus
had
said
seest
thou
these
great
buildings
there
shall
not
be
left
one
stone
upon
another
that
shall
not
be
thrown
down
this
dire
prediction
soon
found
its
literal
fulfilment
in
the
great
conflict
with
the
roman
legions
under
titus
many
of
the
jews
had
taken
refuge
within
the
temple
courts
seemingly
hoping
that
there
the
lord
would
again
fight
the
battles
of
his
people
and
give
them
victory
but
the
protecting
presence
of
jehovah
had
long
since
departed
therefrom
and
israel
was
left
a
prey
to
the
foe
though
titus
would
have
spared
the
temple
his
legionaries
maddened
by
the
lust
of
conflict
started
the
conflagration
and
everything
that
could
be
burned
was
burned
the
slaughter
of
the
jews
was
appalling
thousands
of
men
women
and
children
were
ruthlessly
butchered
within
the
walls
and
the
temple
courts
were
literally
flooded
with
human
blood
this
event
occurred
in
the
year
and
according
to
josephus
in
the
same
month
and
on
the
same
day
of
the
month
as
that
on
which
the
once
glorious
temple
of
solomon
had
fallen
a
prey
to
the
flames
kindled
by
the
king
of
babylon
of
the
temple
furniture
the
golden
candlestick
and
the
table
of
shewbread
from
the
holy
place
were
carried
by
titus
to
rome
as
trophies
of
war
and
representations
of
these
sacred
pieces
are
to
be
seen
on
the
arch
erected
to
the
name
of
the
victorious
general
since
the
destruction
of
the
splendid
temple
of
herod
no
other
structure
of
the
kind
no
temple
no
house
of
the
lord
as
the
terms
are
used
distinctively
has
been
reared
on
the
eastern
hemisphere
sometime
between
and
the
roman
emperor
julian
surnamed
because
of
his
reversion
from
christianity
to
paganism
julian
the
apostate
attempted
to
reconstruct
the
temple
at
jerusalem
his
purpose
was
not
that
of
devotion
to
nor
love
for
god
but
that
of
controverting
prophecy
and
thus
proving
false
the
christian
belief
so
ends
the
category
of
temples
reared
to
the
name
of
the
living
god
prior
to
the
dispensation
of
the
fulness
of
times

need
of
temples
in
the
present
dispensation
among
the
numerous
sects
and
churches
professing
christianity
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
stands
alone
in
the
teaching
and
practise
of
temple
ministration
the
devotion
of
this
people
to
the
sacred
labor
of
building
temples
and
administering
therein
the
saving
ordinances
of
the
gospel
has
attracted
the
attention
and
aroused
the
wonder
of
both
philosopher
and
layman
it
is
not
enough
to
attempt
an
explanation
of
this
singular
and
stupendous
sacrifice
by
ascribing
it
to
assumed
and
unproved
fanaticism
the
earnest
investigator
the
careful
observer
and
even
the
cursory
reader
indeed
if
he
be
honest
admits
that
beneath
this
devotion
is
a
and
an
abiding
faith
it
can
not
be
affirmed
that
the
saints
build
temples
as
monuments
of
communal
wealth
nor
in
the
pride
of
human
aggrandisement
for
we
find
them
thus
arduously
engaged
even
while
bread
was
scarce
and
clothing
scant
among
them
and
throughout
their
history
the
people
have
looked
upon
their
temples
as
edifices
belonging
to
the
lord
and
upon
themselves
as
stewards
entrusted
with
the
custody
of
the
consecrated
properties
nor
can
it
be
said
that
this
church
builds
temples
as
other
sects
erect
chapels
churches
cathedrals
and
synagogues
for
the
church
has
the
equivalent
of
these
and
indeed
the
and
places
of
public
worship
maintained
by
the
latterday
saints
are
proportionately
greater
in
number
than
are
those
of
other
denominations
moreover
as
already
stated
these
temples
are
not
used
as
places
of
common
assembly
nor
as
houses
of
general
and
congregational
service
why
then
does
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
latterday
saints
build
and
maintain
temples
in
answer
let
the
following
pertinent
facts
be
carefully
considered
necessity
of
obedience
to
the
laws
and
ordinances
of
the
gospel
as
part
of
its
declaration
of
faith
the
church
proclaims
believe
that
through
the
atonement
of
christ
all
mankind
may
be
saved
by
obedience
to
the
laws
and
ordinances
of
the
while
professing
belief
in
the
possibility
of
a
universal
salvation
the
church
affirms
that
salvation
is
assured
only
on
condition
of
individual
compliance
with
the
requirements
established
by
the
redeemer
without
whose
atoning
sacrifice
none
could
be
saved
the
atonement
wrought
by
the
christ
on
calvary
was
a
vicarious
offering
in
the
beneficent
results
of
which
all
mankind
are
made
partakers
as
to
redemption
from
the
thrall
of
mortality
incident
to
the
transgression
in
eden
the
sacrificial
death
of
christ
met
in
full
the
exactions
incident
to
the
broken
law
and
none
but
adam
shall
be
held
accountable
for
adam
disobedience
nor
for
any
results
thereof
in
the
just
judgment
to
which
every
mortal
shall
come
all
conditions
of
inherited
weakness
temptation
due
to
environment
the
capacity
to
choose
and
to
act
the
measure
of
knowledge
to
which
the
subject
has
attained
the
meed
of
truth
he
has
accepted
or
rejected
the
opportunities
he
has
used
aright
or
wrongly
spurned
the
fidelity
with
which
he
walked
in
the
light
or
the
depravity
through
which
he
wandered
in
the
forbidden
paths
of
darkness
these
and
every
other
fact
and
circumstance
entering
into
the
individual
life
will
be
duly
weighed
and
considered
at
the
bar
of
god
the
distinguishing
feature
of
divine
mercy
will
be
as
in
the
affairs
of
mortal
life
it
now
is
not
an
arbitrary
forgiveness
of
sin
nor
unearned
annulment
of
the
debts
of
guilt
but
the
providing
of
a
way
whereby
the
sinner
may
be
enabled
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
gospel
and
so
in
due
course
pass
from
the
prison
house
of
sin
to
the
glorious
freedom
of
a
righteous
life
there
is
but
one
price
set
on
forgiveness
for
individual
transgression
and
this
is
alike
to
all
to
poor
and
rich
to
bond
and
free
to
illiterate
and
learned
it
knows
no
fluctuations
it
changes
not
with
time
it
was
the
same
yesterday
as
today
it
is
and
even
so
shall
be
forever
and
that
price
at
which
may
be
bought
the
pearl
beyond
all
price
is
to
the
laws
and
ordinances
of
the
hear
this
further
declaration
of
faith
taught
by
the
restored
church
believe
that
the
first
principles
and
ordinances
of
the
gospel
are
faith
in
the
lord
jesus
christ
repentance
baptism
by
immersion
for
the
remission
of
sins
of
hands
for
the
gift
of
the
holy
in
the
lord
jesus
christ
is
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
gospel
the
first
letter
in
the
alphabet
of
salvation
with
which
are
spelled
the
words
of
life
eternal
yet
who
can
have
faith
in
aught
of
which
he
knows
nothing
knowledge
is
essential
to
faith
and
faith
impels
its
possessor
to
seek
further
knowledge
and
to
make
of
that
knowledge
wisdom
which
is
but
knowledge
applied
and
put
to
use
to
preach
christ
and
him
crucified
is
the
one
and
only
way
by
which
faith
in
him
may
be
taught
through
the
medium
of
either
precept
or
example
while
knowledge
and
faith
are
thus
closely
associated
the
two
are
not
identical
nor
is
the
one
an
assured
outgrowth
of
the
other
a
man
may
have
learned
the
truth
and
yet
may
ignore
it
his
knowledge
far
from
developing
within
his
soul
the
faith
that
leads
to
right
action
may
but
add
to
his
condemnation
for
he
sins
without
even
the
mitigation
of
ignorance
evil
spirits
have
testified
of
their
knowledge
that
jesus
is
the
christ
nevertheless
they
remain
the
fallen
followers
of
satan
as
living
faith
develops
within
the
soul
of
man
it
leads
its
possessor
to
seek
a
means
whereby
he
may
rise
from
the
thraldom
of
sin
and
the
very
thought
of
such
emancipation
inspires
a
loathing
for
the
evil
contamination
of
the
past
the
natural
fruitage
of
that
glorious
growth
is
repentance
as
a
requirement
made
of
all
men
constitutes
the
second
principle
of
the
gospel
of
christ
it
comprises
a
sincere
sorrow
for
the
sins
of
the
past
and
a
resolute
turning
away
therefrom
with
the
solemn
determination
to
endeavor
by
divine
assistance
to
return
thereto
no
more
repentance
comes
as
a
gift
from
god
to
him
who
has
treasured
and
nurtured
the
earlier
gift
of
faith
it
is
not
to
be
had
for
the
careless
asking
it
may
not
be
found
upon
the
highway
it
is
not
of
earth
but
a
treasure
of
heaven
and
is
given
with
care
yet
with
boundless
liberality
unto
those
who
have
brought
forth
works
that
warrant
its
bestowal
that
is
to
say
all
who
prepare
themselves
for
repentance
will
by
the
humbling
and
softening
influence
of
the
holy
spirit
be
brought
to
the
actual
possession
of
this
great
gift
when
peter
was
charged
by
his
with
a
breach
of
law
in
that
he
had
associated
with
gentiles
he
told
his
hearers
of
the
divine
manifestations
he
had
so
recently
received
they
believed
and
declared
then
hath
god
also
to
the
gentiles
granted
repentance
unto
life
paul
also
in
writing
to
the
romans
teaches
that
repentance
comes
through
the
goodness
of
god
wilful
persistency
in
sin
may
lead
to
the
loss
and
forfeiture
of
the
ability
to
repent
and
for
man
to
procrastinate
the
day
of
repentance
is
to
invite
and
eventually
to
insure
such
forfeiture
the
divine
word
through
the
mouth
of
a
modern
prophet
is
thus
explicit
for
i
the
lord
can
not
look
upon
sin
with
the
least
degree
of
allowance
nevertheless
he
that
repents
and
does
the
commandments
of
the
lord
shall
be
forgiven
and
he
that
repents
not
from
him
shall
be
taken
even
the
light
which
he
has
received
for
my
spirit
shall
not
always
strive
with
man
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
saints
believe
and
teach
that
repentance
will
be
possible
and
indeed
required
to
the
yet
unrepentant
even
after
death
and
they
affirm
that
this
doctrine
is
supported
by
scripture
both
ancient
and
modern
we
read
that
while
the
body
of
our
lord
lay
in
the
tomb
between
the
evening
of
the
day
of
crucifixion
and
the
glorious
resurrection
morn
he
was
engaged
in
ministerial
labor
in
the
world
of
disembodied
spirits
peter
specifically
declares
that
our
lord
went
and
preached
unto
the
spirits
in
prison
which
sometime
were
disobedient
when
once
the
of
god
waited
in
the
days
of
noah
the
context
with
which
appear
these
words
of
the
inspired
apostle
shows
that
the
event
referred
to
occurred
prior
to
the
savior
resurrection
furthermore
it
will
be
remembered
that
one
of
the
condemned
malefactors
whose
cross
of
death
stood
alongside
that
of
jesus
manifested
faith
and
even
some
degree
of
repentance
and
received
from
the
suffering
christ
the
benediction
and
assurance
today
shalt
thou
be
with
me
in
paradise
it
can
not
be
maintained
that
this
promise
implied
the
passing
of
the
repentant
sinner
directly
from
the
cross
into
heaven
the
abode
of
the
redeemed
in
the
presence
of
god
for
surely
there
had
been
no
opportunity
for
the
suffering
penitent
to
put
his
repentance
into
effect
by
complying
with
the
established
laws
and
ordinances
of
the
gospel
and
without
such
compliance
even
as
to
the
single
requirement
of
alone
the
man
could
neither
enter
nor
see
the
kingdom
of
god
or
the
word
of
christ
would
have
been
proven
false
moreover
as
conclusive
proof
of
the
fact
that
between
the
time
of
christ
death
and
resurrection
neither
he
nor
the
contrite
sinner
had
gone
to
the
abode
of
god
we
have
the
words
of
the
risen
lord
to
the
sorrowing
magdalene
i
am
not
yet
ascended
to
my
father
in
view
of
scriptural
affirmation
that
the
disembodied
christ
did
visit
and
minister
among
the
spirits
who
had
been
disobedient
and
who
because
of
unpardoned
sin
were
still
held
in
duress
it
is
pertinent
to
inquire
as
to
the
scope
and
object
of
our
savior
ministry
among
them
his
preaching
must
have
been
purposeful
and
positive
moreover
it
is
not
to
be
assumed
that
his
message
was
other
than
one
of
relief
and
mercy
those
to
whom
he
went
were
already
in
prison
and
had
been
there
long
to
them
came
the
redeemer
to
preach
not
to
further
condemn
to
open
the
way
that
led
to
light
not
to
intensify
the
darkness
of
despair
in
which
they
languished
had
not
that
visit
of
deliverance
been
long
predicted
centuries
before
that
fateful
time
isaiah
had
prophesied
of
proud
and
wicked
spirits
and
they
shall
be
gathered
together
as
prisoners
are
gathered
in
the
pit
and
shall
be
shut
up
in
the
prison
and
after
many
days
shall
they
be
visited
and
again
referring
to
the
appointed
ministry
of
the
christ
the
same
inspired
voice
of
prophecy
declared
part
of
that
work
to
be
to
open
the
blind
eyes
to
bring
out
the
prisoners
from
the
prison
and
them
that
sit
in
darkness
out
of
the
prison
house
david
filled
with
the
emotions
of
contrition
and
hope
sang
in
measures
of
mingled
sadness
and
joy
therefore
my
heart
is
glad
and
my
glory
rejoiceth
my
flesh
also
shall
rest
in
hope
for
thou
wilt
not
leave
my
soul
in
hell
from
these
and
other
scriptures
we
learn
that
the
ministry
of
christ
was
not
confined
to
the
few
who
lived
in
mortality
during
the
short
period
of
his
earthly
life
nor
to
them
and
the
generations
then
future
but
to
all
dead
living
and
yet
unborn
it
can
not
be
denied
that
myriads
had
lived
and
died
before
the
meridian
of
time
and
of
these
multitudes
as
of
the
many
since
born
unnumbered
hosts
have
died
without
a
knowledge
of
the
gospel
and
its
prescribed
plan
of
salvation
what
is
their
condition
as
indeed
what
shall
be
the
state
of
the
present
inhabitants
of
earth
and
of
the
multitudes
yet
future
who
shall
die
in
ignorance
and
without
the
faith
that
saves
let
us
ask
again
how
can
those
who
know
not
christ
have
faith
in
him
and
how
while
lacking
both
knowledge
and
faith
can
they
avail
themselves
of
the
provision
made
for
their
salvation
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
affirms
that
the
plan
of
salvation
is
not
bounded
by
the
grave
but
that
the
gospel
is
deathless
and
everlasting
reaching
back
into
the
ages
that
have
gone
and
forward
into
the
eternities
of
the
future
the
ministry
of
the
savior
among
the
dead
doubtless
included
the
revelation
of
his
own
atoning
death
the
inculcation
of
faith
in
himself
and
in
the
plan
he
represented
and
the
necessity
of
a
repentance
acceptable
unto
god
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
that
the
other
essential
requirements
comprised
within
the
and
ordinances
of
the
were
made
known
to
the
less
thoughtful
reader
it
may
appear
that
to
teach
the
possibility
of
repentance
beyond
the
grave
may
tend
to
weaken
belief
in
the
absolute
necessity
of
repentance
and
reformation
in
this
life
a
careful
consideration
of
the
matter
however
will
show
that
this
doctrine
affords
no
reason
for
such
objection
to
reject
or
ignore
in
any
degree
a
gift
of
god
is
to
forfeit
to
the
corresponding
extent
one
claim
upon
that
gift
to
the
soul
that
has
wilfully
neglected
the
opportunities
for
repentance
here
offered
repentance
in
the
hereafter
may
be
and
indeed
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
will
be
so
difficult
as
to
be
long
unattainable
this
conception
is
justified
by
scripture
as
witness
the
words
of
amulek
a
nephite
prophet
who
thus
admonished
the
church
on
the
western
continent
four
score
years
before
the
birth
of
christ
for
behold
this
life
is
the
time
for
men
to
prepare
to
meet
god
therefore
i
beseech
of
you
that
ye
do
not
procrastinate
the
day
of
your
repentance
until
the
end
ye
can
not
say
when
ye
are
brought
to
that
awful
crisis
that
i
will
repent
that
i
will
return
to
my
god
nay
ye
can
not
say
this
for
that
same
spirit
which
doth
possess
your
bodies
at
the
time
that
ye
go
out
of
this
life
that
same
spirit
will
have
power
to
possess
your
body
in
that
eternal
world
for
behold
if
ye
have
procrastinated
the
day
of
your
repentance
even
until
death
behold
ye
have
become
subjected
to
the
spirit
of
the
devil
and
he
doth
seal
you
his
by
is
taught
by
the
church
in
this
dispensation
as
an
essential
ordinance
of
the
gospel
baptism
is
the
gateway
leading
into
the
fold
of
christ
the
portal
to
the
church
the
established
rite
of
naturalization
in
the
kingdom
of
god
the
candidate
for
admission
into
the
church
having
obtained
and
professed
faith
in
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
having
sincerely
repented
of
his
sins
is
properly
required
to
give
evidence
of
this
spiritual
sanctification
by
some
outward
ordinance
prescribed
by
authority
as
the
sign
or
symbol
of
the
new
profession
the
initiatory
ordinance
is
baptism
by
water
to
be
followed
by
the
higher
baptism
of
the
holy
spirit
and
as
a
result
of
this
act
of
obedience
remission
of
sins
is
granted
that
baptism
is
essential
to
salvation
is
attested
by
many
specific
scriptures
yet
even
without
such
its
essentiality
appears
in
view
of
the
unconditional
requirement
of
repentance
and
the
evident
fact
that
to
be
of
value
and
effect
repentance
must
imply
obedience
to
the
divine
requirements
which
include
baptism
by
water
be
it
remembered
that
jesus
the
christ
though
untouched
by
the
taint
of
sin
submitted
in
person
to
this
ordinance
which
was
administered
by
the
baptist
in
the
waters
of
jordan
the
burden
of
john
teaching
was
repent
ye
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
and
to
such
as
came
to
him
professing
repentance
he
administered
baptism
by
water
immersion
then
came
jesus
unto
john
to
be
baptized
of
him
and
the
baptist
regarding
him
as
one
without
sin
demurred
saying
i
have
need
to
be
baptized
of
thee
and
comest
thou
to
me
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
him
suffer
it
to
be
so
now
for
thus
it
becometh
us
to
fulfil
all
righteousness
then
he
suffered
him
and
jesus
when
he
was
baptized
went
up
straightway
out
of
the
water
and
lo
the
heavens
were
opened
unto
him
and
he
saw
the
spirit
of
god
descending
like
a
dove
and
lighting
upon
him
and
lo
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
this
is
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
it
is
evident
from
the
foregoing
that
the
baptism
of
jesus
was
acceptable
unto
the
father
and
was
by
him
characterized
as
an
act
of
humility
and
obedience
on
the
part
of
the
son
with
which
he
was
well
pleased
some
time
after
his
own
baptism
jesus
affirmed
in
words
at
once
forceful
and
unequivocal
that
baptism
is
required
of
all
men
as
a
condition
of
entrance
into
the
kingdom
of
god
to
nicodemus
a
ruler
among
the
jews
who
came
by
night
professing
some
measure
of
faith
jesus
said
verily
verily
i
say
unto
thee
except
a
man
be
born
of
water
and
of
the
spirit
he
can
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
when
in
the
resurrected
state
he
manifested
himself
to
the
apostles
he
instructed
them
by
way
of
final
and
special
commission
go
ye
therefore
and
teach
all
nations
baptizing
them
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
the
necessity
and
purpose
of
the
ordinance
appear
in
his
further
words
on
the
same
solemn
occasion
he
that
believeth
and
is
baptized
shall
be
saved
but
he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
damned
the
apostles
inspired
by
that
divine
commission
ceased
not
to
teach
the
necessity
of
baptism
even
as
long
as
their
ministry
endured
among
mortals
the
elders
of
the
church
in
the
present
dispensation
have
been
directed
and
empowered
by
the
same
authority
and
almost
in
the
same
words
go
ye
into
all
the
world
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
acting
in
the
authority
which
i
have
given
you
baptizing
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
and
he
that
believeth
and
is
baptized
shall
be
saved
and
he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
damned
on
another
occasion
the
lord
added
in
a
revelation
through
the
modern
prophet
joseph
smith
therefore
as
i
said
unto
mine
apostles
i
say
unto
you
again
that
every
soul
who
believeth
on
your
words
and
is
baptized
by
water
for
the
remission
of
sins
shall
receive
the
holy
ghost
and
further
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
they
who
believe
not
on
your
words
and
are
not
baptized
in
water
in
my
name
for
the
remission
of
their
sins
that
they
may
receive
the
holy
ghost
shall
be
damned
and
shall
not
come
into
my
father
kingdom
where
my
father
and
i
am
gift
of
the
holy
follows
baptism
by
water
and
its
authoritative
bestowal
constitutes
the
next
essential
ordinance
of
the
gospel
in
both
ancient
and
modern
times
this
endowment
has
been
regarded
as
a
higher
baptism
lacking
which
the
baptism
of
water
is
incomplete
john
distinctively
known
as
the
baptist
so
taught
on
the
very
eve
of
our
savior
personal
ministry
consider
well
his
words
i
indeed
baptize
you
with
water
unto
repentance
but
he
that
cometh
after
me
is
mightier
than
i
whose
shoes
i
am
not
worthy
to
bear
he
shall
baptize
you
with
the
holy
ghost
and
with
fire
john
testifies
further
that
the
one
who
should
thus
inaugurate
the
higher
baptism
was
jesus
himself
not
until
after
he
had
administered
the
ordinance
of
water
baptism
to
jesus
did
john
recognize
him
as
the
christ
but
immediately
after
that
recognition
the
baptist
fearlessly
proclaimed
his
testimony
behold
the
lamb
of
god
this
is
he
of
whom
i
said
after
me
cometh
a
man
which
is
preferred
before
me
and
i
knew
him
not
but
he
that
sent
me
to
baptize
with
water
the
same
said
unto
me
upon
whom
thou
shalt
see
the
spirit
descending
and
remaining
on
him
the
same
is
he
which
baptizeth
with
the
holy
ghost
jesus
repeatedly
promised
the
apostles
that
the
comforter
or
the
spirit
of
truth
should
be
given
unto
them
and
this
assurance
was
made
specific
and
final
immediately
prior
to
the
ascension
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
not
depart
from
jerusalem
but
wait
for
the
promise
of
the
father
which
saith
he
ye
have
heard
of
me
for
john
truly
baptized
with
water
but
ye
shall
be
baptized
with
the
holy
ghost
not
many
days
hence
ye
shall
receive
power
after
that
the
holy
ghost
is
come
upon
you
and
ye
shall
be
witnesses
unto
me
the
promise
was
fulfilled
at
the
succeeding
pentecost
when
the
apostles
received
power
never
before
known
to
them
the
endowment
being
marked
by
an
outward
manifestation
of
fiery
tongues
the
apostles
thereafter
promised
the
holy
ghost
to
those
who
sought
salvation
peter
exhortation
to
the
multitude
on
that
same
memorable
day
of
pentecost
is
particularly
explicit
and
forceful
in
answer
to
the
inquiry
men
and
brethren
what
shall
we
do
the
chief
of
the
apostles
replied
repent
and
be
baptized
every
one
of
you
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
for
the
remission
of
sins
and
ye
shall
receive
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
a
similar
assurance
as
to
the
higher
endowment
of
the
holy
ghost
following
the
ordinance
of
was
made
by
nephite
prophets
and
by
the
resurrected
christ
in
his
visit
to
the
people
of
the
western
continent
and
later
still
this
has
been
repeated
through
the
church
in
the
current
dispensation
that
of
the
fulness
of
times
i
say
unto
you
again
said
the
lord
in
a
revelation
to
certain
elders
of
the
church
that
every
soul
who
believeth
on
your
words
and
is
baptized
by
water
for
the
remission
of
sins
shall
receive
the
holy
ghost
by
way
of
summary
let
it
be
repeated
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
holds
as
a
fundamental
doctrine
attested
and
proved
by
scripture
both
ancient
and
modern
that
compliance
with
laws
and
ordinances
of
the
is
an
absolute
and
irrevocable
requirement
for
admission
into
the
kingdom
of
god
or
in
other
words
for
the
securing
of
individual
salvation
to
the
souls
of
men
and
that
this
requirement
is
universal
applying
alike
to
every
soul
that
has
attained
to
age
and
powers
of
accountability
in
the
flesh
in
whatever
period
or
dispensation
that
soul
has
lived
in
mortality
it
follows
as
a
necessary
consequence
that
if
any
soul
has
failed
either
through
ignorance
or
neglect
to
render
obedience
to
these
requirements
the
obligation
is
not
removed
by
death
vicarious
service
of
the
living
for
the
dead
a
question
now
arises
as
to
how
it
is
possible
for
the
dead
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
gospel
and
do
in
the
spirit
what
they
had
failed
to
do
in
the
flesh
the
exercise
of
faith
and
the
manifestation
of
repentance
by
disembodied
spirits
may
offer
no
great
difficulty
to
human
understanding
but
that
the
dead
shall
obey
the
ordinances
of
the
gospel
requiring
and
the
baptism
of
the
spirit
by
the
authorized
of
hands
appears
to
many
as
truly
impossible
as
seemed
the
new
birth
to
nicodemus
he
listened
in
amazement
to
the
savior
words
except
a
man
be
born
again
he
can
not
see
the
kingdom
of
god
and
asked
how
can
a
man
be
born
when
he
is
old
can
he
enter
the
second
time
into
his
mother
womb
and
be
born
at
last
he
learned
that
the
new
birth
referred
to
was
baptism
by
water
and
the
baptism
of
the
spirit
with
equal
pertinency
it
may
now
be
asked
how
can
a
man
be
baptized
when
he
is
dead
can
he
enter
the
second
time
into
his
body
of
flesh
and
be
immersed
in
water
by
human
agency
the
answer
is
that
the
necessary
ordinances
may
be
performed
for
the
dead
by
their
living
representatives
the
mortal
subject
acting
as
proxy
for
the
departed
one
thus
even
as
a
man
may
be
baptized
in
his
own
person
for
himself
he
may
be
baptized
as
proxy
for
and
in
behalf
of
the
dead
the
validity
of
vicarious
service
in
which
one
person
acts
in
behalf
of
another
is
generally
recognized
as
an
element
of
human
institutions
and
that
such
service
may
be
acceptable
unto
god
is
attested
by
the
written
word
ancient
and
modern
scripture
the
record
of
history
other
than
sacred
the
traditions
of
tribes
and
nations
the
rites
of
bloody
sacrifice
and
even
the
sacrificial
abominations
of
pagan
idolatry
involve
the
essential
conception
of
vicarious
propitiation
and
of
service
rendered
by
proxy
the
and
the
altar
victim
in
the
mosaic
dispensation
when
offered
by
constituted
authority
and
with
due
accompaniment
of
acknowledgment
and
repentance
were
accepted
by
the
lord
as
sacrifices
in
mitigation
of
the
sins
of
his
people
the
most
significant
sacrifice
of
all
the
greatest
work
ever
wrought
amongst
mankind
the
pivotal
event
in
human
history
the
supreme
achievement
which
was
at
once
the
most
glorious
consummation
and
the
most
blessed
beginning
is
the
atonement
of
christ
and
this
was
a
vicarious
offering
no
one
who
believes
that
jesus
died
for
man
can
doubt
the
validity
and
efficacy
of
vicarious
ministration
he
gave
his
life
as
a
sacrifice
voluntarily
offered
and
duly
accepted
as
a
propitiation
for
broken
law
and
the
means
by
which
salvation
was
made
possible
unto
man
that
his
death
was
literally
an
accepted
offering
in
behalf
of
human
kind
is
thus
set
forth
in
the
words
of
the
resurrected
christ
given
through
modern
revelation
for
behold
i
god
have
suffered
these
things
for
all
that
they
might
not
suffer
if
they
would
repent
but
if
they
would
not
repent
they
must
suffer
even
as
i
which
suffering
caused
myself
even
god
the
greatest
of
all
to
tremble
because
of
pain
and
to
bleed
at
every
pore
and
to
suffer
both
body
and
spirit
and
would
that
i
might
not
drink
the
bitter
cup
and
shrink
nevertheless
glory
be
to
the
father
and
i
partook
and
finished
my
preparations
unto
the
children
of
men
the
vicarious
effect
of
the
atonement
of
christ
is
twofold
it
has
wrought
a
universal
redemption
of
all
men
from
the
mortal
death
incident
to
the
transgression
of
adam
and
it
has
provided
a
means
of
propitiation
for
individual
sin
whereby
the
sinner
may
attain
salvation
through
obedience
it
is
by
his
mortal
life
and
sacrificial
death
in
behalf
of
others
and
those
others
all
who
have
lived
or
shall
live
that
jesus
the
christ
earned
his
title
savior
and
redeemer
of
mankind
and
as
he
by
effort
sacrifice
and
suffering
did
for
men
what
they
never
could
accomplish
for
themselves
and
so
became
in
very
truth
the
one
and
only
savior
and
redeemer
of
the
race
so
may
each
of
us
by
opening
the
way
to
our
departed
dead
whereby
they
may
be
brought
within
the
saving
law
of
the
gospel
become
in
a
small
measure
saviors
unto
those
who
would
otherwise
be
left
in
darkness
in
every
instance
of
vicarious
ministration
it
is
an
indispensable
requisite
that
the
proxy
be
worthy
and
acceptable
and
of
necessity
he
must
himself
have
obeyed
the
laws
and
ordinances
of
the
gospel
before
he
can
officiate
in
behalf
of
others
further
the
ministrations
of
the
living
representative
must
be
in
accordance
with
divine
appointment
and
in
no
wise
a
merely
human
assumption
the
acceptable
sacrifices
of
ancient
israel
were
such
as
had
been
definitely
specified
and
minutely
prescribed
and
the
sacrificial
rites
could
be
solemnized
only
by
authorized
priests
the
supreme
sacrifice
involved
in
the
atoning
death
of
christ
was
as
truly
appointed
and
prophets
through
the
long
centuries
antedating
the
christian
era
predicted
the
birth
life
and
death
of
our
lord
as
already
provided
for
and
these
prophecies
were
confirmed
by
jesus
himself
consider
also
the
testimony
of
the
apostles
to
the
same
effect
peter
specifically
designates
christ
as
a
lamb
without
blemish
and
without
spot
who
verily
was
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
the
designation
lamb
is
indicative
of
a
sacrificial
victim
paul
in
writing
to
the
romans
characterizes
our
lord
as
the
one
whom
god
hath
set
forth
to
be
a
propitiation
through
faith
in
his
blood
to
declare
his
righteousness
for
the
remission
of
sins
that
are
past
the
saints
affirm
that
their
vicarious
work
in
behalf
of
the
dead
is
required
of
them
by
the
call
of
the
lord
through
direct
revelation
and
that
it
becomes
the
duty
and
privilege
of
every
individual
who
accepts
the
gospel
and
enters
the
church
to
labor
for
the
salvation
of
his
dead
he
is
expected
and
required
by
the
obligations
and
responsibility
he
has
assumed
as
a
member
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
so
to
live
as
to
be
a
worthy
representative
of
his
departed
ancestors
in
holy
ordinance
and
to
be
of
clean
life
that
he
may
not
forfeit
his
right
to
enter
the
sacred
confines
of
the
house
where
alone
he
may
officiate
in
that
privileged
capacity
let
it
not
be
assumed
that
this
doctrine
of
vicarious
labor
for
the
dead
implies
even
remotely
that
the
administration
of
ordinances
in
behalf
of
departed
spirits
operates
in
any
manner
to
interfere
with
the
right
of
choice
and
the
exercise
of
free
agency
on
their
part
they
are
at
liberty
to
accept
or
reject
the
ministrations
in
their
behalf
and
so
they
will
accept
or
reject
in
accordance
with
their
converted
or
unregenerate
state
even
as
is
the
case
with
mortals
to
whom
the
gospel
message
may
come
though
baptism
be
duly
administered
to
a
living
man
in
behalf
of
a
dead
ancestor
that
spirit
will
derive
no
immediate
advancement
nor
any
benefit
therefrom
if
he
has
not
yet
attained
faith
in
the
lord
jesus
christ
or
if
he
be
still
unrepentant
even
as
christ
offered
salvation
to
all
though
few
there
be
who
accept
in
the
flesh
so
temple
ordinances
may
be
administered
for
many
in
the
realm
of
the
departed
who
are
not
yet
prepared
to
profit
thereby
it
is
evident
therefore
that
labor
in
behalf
of
the
dead
is
that
performed
on
earth
would
remain
incomplete
and
futile
but
for
its
supplement
and
counterpart
beyond
the
veil
missionary
work
is
in
progress
there
work
compared
with
which
the
evangelistic
labor
of
earth
is
but
a
small
undertaking
there
are
preachers
and
teachers
ministers
invested
with
the
holy
priesthood
all
engaged
in
declaring
the
glad
tidings
of
the
gospel
to
spirits
who
have
not
yet
found
the
light
as
has
been
shown
this
great
labor
amongst
the
dead
was
inaugurated
by
jesus
the
christ
during
the
brief
period
of
his
disembodiment
the
saving
ministry
so
begun
was
left
to
be
continued
by
others
duly
authorized
and
commissioned
even
as
the
work
of
preaching
the
gospel
and
administering
therein
amongst
the
living
was
committed
to
the
apostles
in
the
church
of
old
authority
to
labor
in
behalf
of
the
dead
in
the
closing
chapter
of
the
compilation
of
scriptures
known
to
us
as
the
old
testament
the
prophet
malachi
thus
describes
a
condition
incident
to
the
last
days
immediately
preceding
the
second
coming
of
christ
for
behold
the
day
cometh
that
shall
burn
as
an
oven
and
all
the
proud
yea
and
all
that
do
wickedly
shall
be
stubble
and
the
day
that
cometh
shall
burn
them
up
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
that
it
shall
leave
them
neither
root
nor
branch
but
unto
you
that
fear
my
name
shall
the
sun
of
righteousness
arise
with
healing
in
his
wings
the
fateful
prophecy
concludes
with
the
following
blessed
and
promise
behold
i
will
send
you
elijah
the
prophet
before
the
coming
of
the
great
and
dreadful
day
of
the
lord
and
he
shall
turn
the
heart
of
the
fathers
to
the
children
and
the
heart
of
the
children
to
their
fathers
lest
i
come
and
smite
the
earth
with
a
curse
it
has
been
held
by
theologians
and
bible
commentators
that
this
prediction
had
reference
to
the
birth
and
ministry
of
john
the
baptist
upon
whom
rested
the
spirit
and
power
of
elias
however
we
have
no
record
of
elijah
having
ministered
unto
the
baptist
and
furthermore
the
latter
ministry
glorious
though
it
was
justifies
no
conclusion
that
in
him
did
the
prophecy
find
its
full
realization
in
addition
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
declaration
through
malachi
relative
to
the
day
of
burning
in
which
the
wicked
would
be
destroyed
as
stubble
yet
awaits
fulfilment
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
commonly
accepted
interpretation
is
at
fault
and
that
we
must
look
to
a
later
date
than
the
time
of
john
for
the
fulfilment
of
malachi
prediction
the
later
occasion
has
come
it
belongs
to
the
present
dispensation
and
marks
the
inauguration
of
a
work
specially
reserved
for
the
church
in
these
latter
days
in
the
course
of
a
glorious
manifestation
to
joseph
smith
and
oliver
cowdery
in
the
temple
at
kirtland
ohio
april
there
appeared
unto
them
elijah
the
prophet
of
old
who
had
been
taken
from
earth
while
still
in
the
body
he
declared
unto
them
behold
the
time
has
fully
come
which
was
spoken
of
by
the
mouth
of
malachi
testifying
that
he
elijah
should
be
sent
before
the
great
and
dreadful
day
of
the
lord
come
to
turn
the
hearts
of
the
fathers
to
the
children
and
the
children
to
the
fathers
lest
the
whole
earth
be
smitten
with
a
curse
therefore
the
keys
of
this
dispensation
are
committed
into
your
hands
and
by
this
ye
may
know
that
the
great
and
dreadful
day
of
the
lord
is
near
even
at
the
doors
one
of
the
fundamental
principles
underlying
the
doctrine
of
salvation
for
the
dead
is
that
of
the
mutual
dependance
of
the
fathers
and
the
children
family
lineage
and
the
sequence
of
generations
in
each
particular
line
of
descent
are
facts
and
can
not
be
changed
by
death
on
the
other
hand
it
is
evident
from
the
olden
scriptures
already
cited
and
attested
by
the
equally
sure
word
of
modern
revelation
that
the
family
relationships
of
earth
are
recognized
in
the
spirit
world
neither
the
children
nor
the
fathers
neither
progenitors
nor
descendants
can
alone
attain
perfection
and
the
requisite
is
effected
through
baptism
and
related
ordinances
administered
to
the
living
in
behalf
of
the
dead
in
this
way
and
through
this
work
are
the
hearts
of
the
fathers
and
those
of
the
children
turned
toward
each
other
as
the
living
children
learn
that
without
their
ancestors
they
can
not
attain
a
perfect
status
in
the
eternal
world
their
own
faith
will
be
strengthened
and
they
will
be
willing
to
labor
for
the
redemption
and
salvation
of
their
dead
and
the
dead
learning
through
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
in
their
world
that
they
are
dependent
upon
their
descendants
as
vicarious
saviors
will
turn
with
loving
faith
and
prayerful
effort
toward
their
children
yet
living
this
uniting
of
the
interests
of
fathers
and
children
is
a
part
of
the
necessary
preparation
for
the
yet
future
advent
of
the
christ
as
ruling
king
and
lord
of
earth
joseph
smith
thus
taught
the
earth
will
be
smitten
with
a
curse
unless
there
is
a
welding
link
of
some
kind
or
other
between
the
fathers
and
the
children
upon
some
subject
or
other
and
behold
what
is
that
subject
it
is
the
baptism
for
the
dead
for
we
without
them
can
not
be
made
perfect
neither
can
they
without
us
be
made
perfect
the
church
today
cites
as
authority
for
its
administration
of
ordinances
in
behalf
of
the
dead
the
special
bestowal
of
this
power
and
office
through
the
ministry
of
elijah
and
furthermore
the
church
holds
that
the
giving
of
that
power
marked
the
fulfilment
of
malachi
portentous
prediction
there
appears
an
element
of
particular
fitness
in
the
fact
that
the
minister
through
whom
this
great
work
has
been
inaugurated
in
the
present
dispensation
is
none
other
than
elijah
who
not
having
passed
the
portals
of
death
held
a
peculiar
and
special
relation
to
both
the
dead
and
the
living
as
to
the
fidelity
with
which
the
church
has
served
under
this
special
commission
the
temples
it
has
reared
with
such
sacrifice
and
on
the
part
of
its
devoted
adherents
and
the
ordinance
work
already
performed
therein
are
sufficient
proof
the
importance
with
which
the
saints
regard
their
temple
work
in
behalf
of
the
dead
naturally
produces
among
this
people
a
vital
interest
in
the
genealogical
records
of
their
respective
families
ordinance
work
in
the
temples
in
behalf
of
any
departed
person
can
be
done
only
as
that
person
may
be
described
on
the
record
as
to
name
relationship
time
and
place
of
birth
and
death
by
which
data
he
may
be
fully
and
certainly
isolated
and
identified
it
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
interest
in
genealogical
research
has
greatly
increased
in
the
united
states
and
in
europe
during
the
last
seven
or
eight
decades
genealogical
societies
have
been
formed
and
individual
investigators
have
devoted
great
treasures
of
time
and
money
to
the
compilation
of
records
showing
numerous
lines
of
family
descent
and
the
many
ramifications
of
complicated
relationship
in
all
this
work
the
saints
profess
to
see
the
operation
of
an
power
by
which
their
service
for
the
dead
is
facilitated
temples
required
for
vicarious
service
while
the
ordinances
of
baptism
imposition
of
hands
for
the
bestowal
of
the
holy
ghost
and
others
such
as
ordination
to
the
priesthood
may
be
performed
upon
the
living
in
any
suitable
and
proper
place
the
corresponding
ordinances
for
and
in
behalf
of
the
dead
are
acceptable
unto
the
lord
and
therefore
valid
only
when
administered
in
places
specially
provided
set
apart
and
dedicated
for
these
and
kindred
purposes
that
is
to
say
such
ordinances
belong
exclusively
to
the
house
of
the
lord
for
a
very
brief
period
only
and
that
the
earliest
in
modern
church
history
before
the
people
had
opportunity
to
erect
temples
did
the
lord
graciously
accept
a
temporary
sanctuary
even
as
he
accepted
the
tabernacle
of
old
as
a
temporary
temple
during
the
period
of
israel
wanderings
in
a
revelation
given
to
joseph
smith
the
prophet
at
nauvoo
illinois
january
the
lord
called
upon
his
people
to
build
a
house
to
his
name
for
the
most
high
to
dwell
therein
and
added
by
way
of
explanation
and
instruction
for
there
is
not
a
place
found
on
earth
that
he
may
come
and
restore
again
that
which
was
lost
unto
you
or
which
he
hath
taken
away
even
the
fulness
of
the
priesthood
for
a
baptismal
font
there
is
not
upon
the
earth
that
they
my
saints
may
be
baptized
for
those
who
are
dead
for
this
ordinance
belongeth
to
my
house
and
can
not
be
acceptable
to
me
only
in
the
days
of
your
poverty
wherein
ye
are
not
able
to
build
a
house
unto
me
but
i
command
you
all
ye
my
saints
to
build
a
house
unto
me
and
i
grant
unto
you
a
sufficient
time
to
build
a
house
unto
me
and
during
this
time
your
baptisms
shall
be
acceptable
unto
me
but
behold
at
the
end
of
this
appointment
your
baptisms
for
your
dead
shall
not
be
acceptable
unto
me
and
if
you
do
not
these
things
at
the
end
of
the
appointment
ye
shall
be
rejected
as
a
church
with
your
dead
saith
the
lord
your
god
for
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
after
you
have
had
sufficient
time
to
build
a
house
to
me
wherein
the
ordinance
of
baptizing
for
the
dead
belongeth
and
for
which
the
same
was
instituted
from
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
your
baptisms
for
your
dead
can
not
be
acceptable
unto
me
for
therein
are
the
keys
of
the
holy
priesthood
ordained
that
you
may
receive
honor
and
glory
and
after
this
time
your
baptisms
for
the
dead
by
those
who
are
scattered
abroad
are
not
acceptable
unto
me
saith
the
lord
for
it
is
ordained
that
in
zion
and
in
her
stakes
and
in
jerusalem
those
places
which
i
have
appointed
for
refuge
shall
be
the
places
for
your
baptisms
for
your
dead
and
again
verily
i
say
unto
you
how
shall
your
washings
be
acceptable
unto
me
except
ye
perform
them
in
a
house
which
you
have
built
to
my
name
for
for
this
cause
i
commanded
moses
that
he
should
build
a
tabernacle
that
they
should
bear
it
with
them
in
the
wilderness
and
to
build
a
house
in
the
land
of
promise
that
those
ordinances
might
be
revealed
which
had
been
hid
from
before
the
world
was
therefore
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
your
anointings
and
your
washings
and
your
baptisms
for
the
dead
and
your
solemn
assemblies
and
your
memorials
for
your
sacrifices
by
the
sons
of
levi
and
for
your
oracles
in
your
most
holy
places
wherein
you
receive
conversations
and
your
statutes
and
judgments
for
the
beginning
of
the
revelations
and
foundation
of
zion
and
for
the
glory
honor
and
endowment
of
all
her
municipals
are
ordained
by
the
ordinance
of
my
holy
house
which
my
people
are
always
commanded
to
build
unto
my
holy
name
and
verily
i
say
unto
you
let
this
house
be
built
unto
my
name
that
i
may
reveal
mine
ordinances
therein
unto
my
people
for
i
deign
to
reveal
unto
my
church
things
which
have
been
kept
hid
from
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
things
that
pertain
to
the
dispensation
of
the
fulness
of
times
this
then
is
sufficient
answer
to
the
question
as
to
why
the
saints
build
and
maintain
temples
they
have
been
instructed
and
required
so
to
do
by
the
lord
of
hosts
they
have
learned
that
many
essential
ordinances
of
the
church
are
acceptable
only
when
performed
in
temples
specially
erected
and
reserved
for
the
purpose
they
know
that
within
these
precincts
of
sanctity
the
lord
has
revealed
many
great
and
important
things
pertaining
to
the
kingdom
of
god
and
that
he
has
promised
to
reveal
yet
more
to
man
in
houses
sacred
to
his
name
they
have
learned
that
a
great
part
of
the
mission
and
ministry
of
the
restored
church
is
the
administration
of
vicarious
ordinances
in
behalf
of
the
unnumbered
dead
who
never
heard
the
tidings
of
the
gospel
and
that
for
such
sacred
and
saving
service

chapter
iv
modern
temple
ordinances
a
more
detailed
consideration
of
modern
temple
service
now
claims
our
attention
the
ceremonial
work
comprises
baptism
specifically
baptism
for
the
dead
ordination
and
associated
endowments
in
the
priesthood
marriage
ceremonies
other
sealing
ordinances
as
will
be
understood
from
what
has
been
already
written
each
of
these
ceremonies
or
ordinances
may
be
performed
either
for
the
living
present
in
person
or
for
the
dead
who
are
represented
each
by
an
individual
living
proxy
the
living
are
but
few
compared
with
the
dead
and
it
follows
of
necessity
that
the
for
the
departed
exceeds
by
a
great
preponderance
that
done
for
the
living
the
temples
of
today
are
maintained
largely
for
the
benefit
and
salvation
of
the
uncounted
dead
baptism
for
the
dead
as
demonstrated
in
the
preceding
pages
the
law
of
baptism
is
of
universal
application
in
short
baptism
is
required
of
all
who
have
lived
to
the
age
of
accountability
only
those
who
die
in
infancy
are
exempt
children
having
no
sin
to
expiate
and
being
unable
to
comprehend
the
nature
of
the
baptismal
obligation
are
not
to
be
baptized
while
living
nor
is
the
ordinance
to
be
performed
for
them
should
they
die
before
reaching
a
responsible
age
and
state
as
to
the
child
part
in
the
heritage
of
mortality
incident
to
the
transgression
of
adam
the
atonement
of
christ
is
of
full
effect
and
the
redemption
of
the
child
is
assured
regarding
the
general
applicability
of
the
law
prescribing
baptism
as
essential
to
salvation
the
scriptures
make
no
distinction
between
the
living
and
the
dead
the
atoning
sacrifice
of
christ
was
offered
not
only
for
the
few
who
lived
upon
the
earth
while
he
was
in
the
flesh
nor
for
those
alone
who
were
born
in
mortality
after
his
death
but
for
all
inhabitants
of
earth
then
past
present
and
future
he
was
ordained
of
the
father
to
be
a
judge
of
both
quick
and
dead
he
is
lord
alike
of
living
and
dead
as
men
speak
of
dead
and
living
though
all
live
unto
him
among
the
pernicious
dogmas
taught
by
a
perverted
and
christianity
is
the
heinous
doctrine
that
punishment
or
interminable
bliss
unchanging
in
kind
or
degree
shall
be
the
destiny
of
every
soul
the
award
being
made
according
to
the
condition
of
that
soul
at
the
time
of
bodily
death
a
life
of
sin
being
thus
nullified
by
a
repentance
and
a
life
of
honor
if
unmarked
by
the
ceremonies
of
established
sects
being
followed
by
the
tortures
of
hell
without
a
possibility
of
relief
such
a
dogma
is
to
be
ranked
with
the
dread
heresy
which
proclaims
the
condemnation
of
innocent
babes
who
have
not
been
sprinkled
by
man
assumed
authority
in
the
justice
of
god
no
soul
shall
be
finally
condemned
under
a
law
of
which
he
has
had
no
chance
to
learn
true
eternal
punishment
has
been
decreed
as
the
lot
of
the
wicked
but
the
real
meaning
of
the
punishment
so
decreed
has
been
made
known
by
the
lord
himself
eternal
punishment
is
god
punishment
endless
punishment
is
his
for
endless
and
eternal
are
among
his
names
and
the
words
are
descriptive
of
his
attributes
no
soul
will
be
punished
for
sin
beyond
the
time
requisite
to
work
the
needed
reformation
and
to
vindicate
justice
for
which
ends
alone
punishment
is
imposed
and
no
one
will
be
eligible
to
enter
any
kingdom
of
glory
in
the
abode
of
the
blessed
to
which
he
is
not
entitled
through
obedience
to
law
it
follows
as
a
plain
necessity
that
the
gospel
must
be
proclaimed
in
the
spirit
world
and
that
such
ministry
is
provided
for
the
scriptures
abundantly
prove
peter
defining
the
mission
of
the
redeemer
thus
declares
this
solemn
truth
for
this
cause
was
the
gospel
preached
also
to
them
that
are
dead
that
they
might
be
judged
according
to
men
in
the
flesh
but
live
according
to
god
in
the
spirit
as
already
shown
the
inauguration
of
this
work
among
the
dead
was
wrought
by
christ
in
the
interval
between
his
death
and
resurrection
in
his
first
epistle
to
the
saints
in
corinth
paul
presents
a
brief
yet
comprehensive
treatment
of
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
a
subject
which
at
that
time
and
among
those
to
whom
he
wrote
had
given
rise
to
much
contention
and
debate
and
having
shown
that
through
christ
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
had
been
made
possible
and
that
in
due
course
all
mankind
shall
be
redeemed
from
bodily
death
the
apostle
asks
else
what
shall
they
do
which
are
baptized
for
the
dead
if
the
dead
rise
not
at
all
why
then
are
they
baptized
for
the
dead
as
the
question
is
put
by
way
of
finality
and
climax
to
the
preceding
argument
it
is
evident
that
the
subject
so
introduced
was
no
new
or
strange
doctrine
but
on
the
contrary
one
with
which
the
people
addressed
must
have
been
familiar
and
which
to
them
required
no
argument
baptism
for
the
dead
was
therefore
both
known
as
a
principle
and
practised
as
an
ordinance
in
apostolic
times
that
the
practise
was
continued
in
some
form
for
a
century
or
more
after
the
apostles
had
passed
from
the
earth
is
evidenced
by
numerous
passages
in
the
writings
of
the
early
christian
fathers
and
by
later
authorities
on
ecclesiastical
history
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
proclaims
the
present
as
the
dispensation
of
the
fulness
of
times
in
which
shall
be
gathered
and
all
the
saving
principles
and
essential
ordinances
of
earlier
dispensations
and
during
which
the
great
plan
of
universal
redemption
shall
be
fully
revealed
the
church
therefore
provides
for
the
actual
work
of
baptism
for
the
dead
and
in
the
temples
of
today
this
sacred
labor
is
in
uninterrupted
progress
as
will
be
seen
each
of
the
temples
is
provided
with
a
baptismal
font
with
every
necessary
provision
for
the
administration
of
this
ordinance
the
rite
of
in
behalf
of
the
dead
is
followed
by
that
of
the
of
hands
for
the
bestowal
of
the
holy
ghost
and
in
this
as
in
the
preceding
the
dead
person
is
represented
by
the
living
proxy
the
imposition
of
hands
for
the
conferring
of
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
constitutes
the
higher
baptism
of
the
spirit
required
alike
of
all
and
includes
the
rite
of
confirmation
by
which
the
person
becomes
a
member
of
the
church
of
christ
in
all
essentials
the
ordinances
of
baptism
and
confirmation
are
identical
whether
administered
to
the
living
for
themselves
or
as
proxy
for
the
dead
as
these
ordinances
are
administered
in
existing
temples
it
is
required
that
beside
the
recorder
and
the
officiating
elder
two
witnesses
be
present
and
that
they
attest
the
ceremony
as
duly
performed
ordination
and
endowment
and
the
higher
baptism
of
the
spirit
by
the
authorized
imposition
of
hands
for
the
conferring
of
the
holy
ghost
constitute
the
two
fundamental
ordinances
of
the
gospel
the
repentant
soul
who
has
thus
entered
the
church
of
christ
may
afterward
attain
to
position
and
authority
in
the
holy
priesthood
not
as
an
earthly
honor
not
as
a
title
of
personal
aggrandizement
not
as
a
symbol
of
power
to
rule
and
possibly
to
oppress
but
as
an
endowment
bespeaking
authority
and
the
express
responsibility
to
use
that
authority
in
the
service
of
his
fellows
and
to
the
glory
of
god
in
the
temple
service
the
man
who
appears
as
proxy
for
his
dead
relative
must
be
ordained
to
the
priesthood
before
he
can
pass
beyond
the
baptismal
font
it
is
a
precept
of
the
church
that
women
of
the
church
share
the
authority
of
the
priesthood
with
their
husbands
actual
or
prospective
and
therefore
women
whether
taking
the
endowment
for
themselves
or
for
the
dead
are
not
ordained
to
specific
rank
in
the
priesthood
nevertheless
there
is
no
grade
rank
or
phase
of
the
temple
endowment
to
which
women
are
not
eligible
on
an
equality
with
men
true
there
are
certain
of
the
higher
ordinances
to
which
an
unmarried
woman
can
not
be
admitted
but
the
rule
is
equally
in
force
as
to
a
bachelor
the
married
state
is
regarded
as
sacred
sanctified
and
holy
in
all
temple
procedure
and
within
the
house
of
the
lord
the
woman
is
the
equal
and
the
of
the
man
in
the
privileges
and
blessings
of
that
holy
place
the
utterance
of
paul
is
regarded
as
a
scriptural
decree
in
full
force
and
effect
neither
is
the
man
without
the
woman
neither
the
woman
without
the
man
in
the
lord
faith
and
sincere
repentance
followed
first
by
and
then
by
the
of
hands
for
the
bestowal
of
the
holy
ghost
are
the
prescribed
means
of
admission
into
the
church
of
christ
and
prospective
salvation
in
the
kingdom
of
god
but
there
is
a
distinction
between
salvation
and
exaltation
at
this
point
it
may
be
well
to
consider
this
distinction
and
to
set
forth
the
doctrines
of
the
restored
church
as
to
the
graded
degrees
of
exaltation
beyond
the
grave
and
exaltation
some
degree
of
salvation
will
come
to
all
who
have
not
forfeited
their
right
to
it
exaltation
is
given
to
those
only
who
by
active
labors
have
won
a
claim
to
god
merciful
liberality
by
which
it
is
bestowed
of
the
saved
not
all
will
be
exalted
to
the
higher
glories
rewards
will
not
be
bestowed
in
violation
of
justice
punishments
will
not
be
meted
out
to
the
ignoring
of
mercy
claims
no
one
can
be
admitted
to
any
order
of
glory
in
short
no
soul
can
be
saved
until
justice
has
been
satisfied
for
violated
law
in
the
kingdom
of
god
there
are
numerous
degrees
of
exaltation
provided
for
those
who
are
worthy
of
them
the
old
idea
that
in
the
hereafter
there
will
be
but
two
places
for
the
souls
of
mankind
a
heaven
and
a
hell
with
the
same
glory
in
all
parts
of
the
one
and
the
same
terrors
throughout
the
other
is
wholly
untenable
in
the
light
of
divine
revelation
of
glory
that
the
privileges
and
glories
of
heaven
are
graded
to
suit
the
various
capacities
of
the
blessed
is
indicated
in
christ
teachings
to
his
apostles
he
said
in
my
father
house
are
many
mansions
if
it
were
not
so
i
would
have
told
you
i
go
to
prepare
a
place
for
you
and
if
i
go
and
prepare
a
place
for
you
i
will
come
again
and
receive
you
unto
myself
that
where
i
am
there
ye
may
be
also
this
declaration
is
supplemented
by
that
of
paul
who
speaks
of
the
graded
glories
of
the
resurrection
as
follows
there
are
also
celestial
bodies
and
bodies
terrestrial
but
the
glory
of
the
celestial
is
one
and
the
glory
of
the
terrestrial
is
another
there
is
one
glory
of
the
sun
and
another
glory
of
the
moon
and
another
glory
of
the
stars
for
one
star
differeth
from
another
star
in
glory
so
also
is
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
a
fuller
knowledge
of
this
subject
has
been
imparted
in
the
present
dispensation
from
a
revelation
given
in
we
learn
the
following
three
great
kingdoms
or
degrees
of
glory
are
established
for
the
future
habitation
of
the
human
race
these
are
known
as
the
celestial
the
terrestrial
and
the
telestial
far
below
the
last
and
least
of
these
is
the
state
of
eternal
punishment
prepared
for
the
sons
of
perdition
celestial
is
provided
for
those
who
merit
the
highest
honors
of
heaven
in
the
revelation
referred
to
we
read
of
them
they
are
they
who
received
the
testimony
of
jesus
and
believed
on
his
name
and
were
baptized
after
the
manner
of
his
burial
being
buried
in
the
water
in
his
name
and
this
according
to
the
commandment
which
he
has
given
that
by
keeping
the
commandments
they
might
be
washed
and
cleansed
from
all
their
sins
and
receive
the
holy
spirit
by
the
laying
on
of
the
hands
of
him
who
is
ordained
and
sealed
unto
this
power
and
who
overcome
by
faith
and
are
sealed
by
the
holy
spirit
of
promise
which
the
father
sheds
forth
upon
all
those
who
are
just
and
true
they
are
they
who
are
the
church
of
the
they
are
they
into
whose
hands
the
father
has
given
all
things
they
are
they
who
are
priests
and
kings
who
have
received
of
his
fulness
and
of
his
glory
and
are
priests
of
the
most
high
after
the
order
of
melchisedek
which
was
after
the
order
of
enoch
which
was
after
the
order
of
the
only
begotten
son
wherefore
as
it
is
written
they
are
gods
even
the
sons
of
god
wherefore
all
things
are
theirs
whether
life
or
death
or
things
present
or
things
to
come
all
are
theirs
and
they
are
christ
and
christ
is
god
these
shall
dwell
in
the
presence
of
god
and
his
christ
for
ever
and
ever
these
are
they
whom
he
shall
bring
with
him
when
he
shall
come
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
to
reign
on
the
earth
over
his
people
these
are
they
who
shall
have
a
part
in
the
first
resurrection
these
are
they
who
shall
come
forth
in
the
resurrection
of
the
just
these
are
they
who
are
just
men
made
perfect
through
jesus
the
mediator
of
the
new
covenant
who
wrought
out
this
perfect
atonement
through
the
shedding
of
his
own
blood
these
are
they
whose
bodies
are
celestial
whose
glory
is
that
of
the
sun
even
the
glory
of
god
the
highest
of
all
whose
glory
the
sun
of
the
firmament
is
written
of
as
being
typical
terrestrial
glory
this
the
next
lower
degree
will
be
received
by
many
whose
works
do
not
merit
the
highest
reward
we
read
of
them
these
are
they
who
are
of
the
terrestrial
whose
glory
differs
from
that
of
the
church
of
the
who
have
received
the
fulness
of
the
father
even
as
that
of
the
moon
differs
from
the
sun
in
the
firmament
behold
these
are
they
who
died
without
law
and
also
they
who
are
the
spirits
of
men
kept
in
prison
whom
the
son
visited
and
preached
the
gospel
unto
them
that
they
might
be
judged
according
to
men
in
the
flesh
who
received
not
the
testimony
of
jesus
in
the
flesh
but
afterwards
received
it
these
are
they
who
are
honorable
men
of
the
earth
who
were
blinded
by
the
craftiness
of
men
these
are
they
who
receive
of
his
glory
but
not
of
his
fulness
these
are
they
who
receive
of
the
presence
of
the
son
but
not
of
the
fulness
of
the
father
wherefore
they
are
bodies
terrestrial
and
not
bodies
celestial
and
differ
in
glory
as
the
moon
differs
from
the
sun
these
are
they
who
are
not
valiant
in
the
testimony
of
jesus
wherefore
they
obtain
not
the
crown
over
the
kingdom
of
our
god
telestial
glory
the
revelation
continues
and
again
we
saw
the
glory
of
the
telestial
which
glory
is
that
of
the
lesser
even
as
the
glory
of
the
stars
differs
from
that
of
the
glory
of
the
moon
in
the
firmament
these
are
they
who
received
not
the
gospel
of
christ
neither
the
testimony
of
jesus
these
are
they
who
deny
not
the
holy
spirit
these
are
they
who
are
thrust
down
to
hell
these
are
they
who
shall
not
be
redeemed
from
the
devil
until
the
last
resurrection
until
the
lord
even
christ
the
lamb
shall
have
finished
his
work
we
learn
further
that
the
inhabitants
of
this
kingdom
are
to
be
graded
among
themselves
comprising
as
they
do
the
unenlightened
among
the
varied
opposing
sects
and
divisions
of
men
and
sinners
of
many
types
whose
offenses
are
not
those
of
utter
perdition
for
as
one
star
differs
from
another
star
in
glory
even
so
differs
one
from
another
in
glory
in
the
telestial
world
for
these
are
they
who
are
of
paul
and
of
apollos
and
of
cephas
these
are
they
who
say
they
are
some
of
one
and
some
of
another
some
of
christ
and
some
of
john
and
some
of
moses
and
some
of
elias
and
some
of
esaias
and
some
of
isaiah
and
some
of
enoch
but
received
not
the
gospel
neither
the
testimony
of
jesus
neither
the
prophets
neither
the
everlasting
covenant
the
three
kingdoms
of
widely
differing
glories
are
organized
on
an
orderly
plan
of
gradation
we
have
seen
that
the
telestial
kingdom
comprises
several
subdivisions
this
also
is
the
case
we
are
told
with
the
celestial
and
by
analogy
we
conclude
that
a
similar
condition
prevails
in
the
terrestrial
thus
the
innumerable
degrees
of
merit
amongst
mankind
are
provided
for
in
an
infinity
of
graded
glories
the
celestial
kingdom
is
supremely
honored
by
the
personal
ministrations
of
the
father
and
the
son
the
terrestrial
kingdom
will
be
administered
through
the
higher
without
a
fulness
of
glory
the
telestial
is
governed
through
the
ministrations
of
the
terrestrial
by
angels
who
are
appointed
to
minister
for
them
exaltation
in
the
kingdom
of
god
implies
attainment
to
the
graded
orders
of
the
holy
priesthood
and
with
these
the
ceremonies
of
the
endowment
are
directly
associated
temple
as
administered
in
modern
temples
comprises
instruction
relating
to
the
significance
and
sequence
of
past
dispensations
and
the
importance
of
the
present
as
the
greatest
and
grandest
era
in
human
history
this
course
of
instruction
includes
a
recital
of
the
most
prominent
events
of
the
creative
period
the
condition
of
our
first
parents
in
the
garden
of
eden
their
disobedience
and
consequent
expulsion
from
that
blissful
abode
their
condition
in
the
lone
and
dreary
world
when
doomed
to
live
by
labor
and
sweat
the
plan
of
redemption
by
which
the
great
transgression
may
be
atoned
the
period
of
the
great
apostasy
the
restoration
of
the
gospel
with
all
its
ancient
powers
and
privileges
the
absolute
and
indispensable
condition
of
personal
purity
and
devotion
to
the
right
in
present
life
and
a
strict
compliance
with
gospel
requirements
as
will
be
shown
the
temples
erected
by
the
saints
provide
for
the
giving
of
these
instructions
in
separate
rooms
each
devoted
to
a
particular
part
of
the
course
and
by
this
provision
it
is
possible
to
have
several
classes
under
instruction
at
one
time
the
ordinances
of
the
endowment
embody
certain
obligations
on
the
part
of
the
individual
such
as
covenant
and
promise
to
observe
the
law
of
strict
virtue
and
chastity
to
be
charitable
benevolent
tolerant
and
pure
to
devote
both
talent
and
material
means
to
the
spread
of
truth
and
the
uplifting
of
the
race
to
maintain
devotion
to
the
cause
of
truth
and
to
seek
in
every
way
to
contribute
to
the
great
preparation
that
the
earth
may
be
made
ready
to
receive
her
king
the
lord
jesus
christ
with
the
taking
of
each
covenant
and
the
assuming
of
each
obligation
a
promised
blessing
is
pronounced
contingent
upon
the
faithful
observance
of
the
conditions
no
jot
iota
or
tittle
of
the
temple
rites
is
otherwise
than
uplifting
and
sanctifying
in
every
detail
the
endowment
ceremony
contributes
to
covenants
of
morality
of
life
consecration
of
person
to
high
ideals
devotion
to
truth
patriotism
to
nation
and
allegiance
to
god
the
blessings
of
the
house
of
the
lord
are
restricted
to
no
privileged
class
every
member
of
the
church
may
have
admission
to
the
temple
with
the
right
to
participate
in
the
ordinances
thereof
if
he
comes
duly
accredited
as
of
worthy
life
and
conduct
sealing
in
marriage
the
saints
regard
the
marriage
ceremony
performed
exclusively
within
temple
precincts
as
the
one
and
only
perfect
contract
of
matrimony
they
recognize
the
full
legal
validity
and
moral
obligation
of
any
marriage
entered
into
under
the
secular
law
but
civil
marriages
and
indeed
all
marriages
made
without
the
binding
authority
of
the
holy
priesthood
they
regard
as
contracts
for
this
life
only
and
therefore
lacking
the
higher
and
superior
elements
of
a
complete
and
perpetual
union
they
hold
that
the
family
relationships
of
earth
may
be
made
lasting
and
binding
beyond
the
veil
of
death
they
say
that
under
the
perfect
law
operative
in
the
celestial
worlds
the
earthly
relation
of
husband
and
wife
parent
and
child
will
endure
in
full
force
and
effect
provided
such
relationship
has
been
sealed
on
earth
by
the
power
and
authority
of
the
holy
priesthood
the
ordinary
rite
of
matrimony
as
established
by
secular
law
and
as
prescribed
by
sectarian
rule
unites
the
man
and
the
woman
for
this
world
only
the
higher
law
of
marriage
as
divinely
revealed
joins
the
parties
for
time
and
eternity
celestial
marriage
is
a
term
in
current
use
among
the
saints
though
it
does
not
occur
in
any
revelation
contained
in
the
standard
works
of
the
church
the
church
adopts
and
validates
the
scriptures
of
earlier
dispensations
with
respect
to
marriage
it
holds
that
marriage
is
honorable
and
ordained
of
god
under
the
teachings
of
the
church
marriage
is
the
duty
of
all
who
are
not
debarred
by
physical
or
other
effective
disability
from
assuming
the
responsibilities
of
the
wedded
state
the
saints
declare
that
part
of
the
birthright
of
every
worthy
man
is
to
stand
at
the
head
of
a
family
as
husband
and
father
and
equally
strong
is
the
right
of
every
worthy
woman
to
be
an
honored
wife
and
mother
the
church
denounces
as
false
and
pernicious
the
teachings
of
misled
and
morbid
men
who
say
that
the
union
of
the
sexes
is
but
a
carnal
necessity
inherited
by
man
as
an
incident
of
his
degraded
nature
and
it
repudiates
the
thought
that
celibacy
is
a
superior
condition
more
pleasing
to
god
concerning
such
false
teachers
the
lord
has
spoken
in
this
day
whoso
forbiddeth
to
marry
is
not
ordained
of
god
for
marriage
is
ordained
of
god
unto
man
that
the
earth
might
answer
the
end
of
its
creation
and
that
it
might
be
filled
with
the
measure
of
man
according
to
his
creation
before
the
world
was
made
the
saints
affirm
that
perfect
marriage
provides
for
the
eternal
relation
of
the
sexes
with
this
people
marriage
is
not
merely
a
contract
for
time
effective
only
as
long
as
the
parties
shall
live
on
earth
but
a
solemn
covenant
of
union
which
shall
endure
beyond
the
grave
in
the
complete
ceremony
of
marriage
as
ordained
by
the
church
and
as
administered
only
within
the
temple
halls
the
man
and
the
woman
are
placed
under
covenant
of
mutual
fidelity
not
until
death
do
them
part
but
for
time
and
for
all
eternity
a
contract
as
as
this
a
covenant
declared
to
be
effective
not
only
throughout
the
period
of
mortal
life
but
in
the
realm
of
the
hereafter
of
necessity
requires
for
its
validation
an
authority
superior
to
any
that
man
may
originate
it
is
admitted
without
argument
that
men
have
the
right
to
form
among
themselves
associations
and
communities
to
organize
sects
parties
companies
churches
clubs
or
any
other
union
they
may
choose
to
create
provided
of
course
such
bodies
are
not
inimical
to
law
and
order
it
is
further
admitted
that
any
established
association
of
men
may
enact
laws
and
ordain
rules
for
the
government
of
its
members
provided
the
rights
of
individual
liberty
are
not
infringed
thereby
both
church
and
state
therefore
may
enact
prescribe
and
ordain
lawful
regulations
as
to
marriage
or
as
to
any
other
form
of
contract
and
such
regulations
are
acknowledged
to
be
of
full
effect
within
the
domain
of
actual
jurisdiction
thus
marriages
may
be
legally
and
properly
authorized
by
states
and
nations
and
the
contracts
of
marriage
so
made
are
effective
during
the
life
of
the
parties
thereto
but
can
it
be
said
that
any
association
of
men
may
create
and
establish
an
authority
that
shall
be
effective
after
death
can
any
power
legislate
beyond
its
lawful
jurisdiction
can
a
man
sitting
in
his
own
home
prescribe
family
rules
for
the
household
of
his
neighbor
can
our
nation
ordain
laws
that
shall
be
valid
in
a
foreign
realm
can
man
enact
laws
to
regulate
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom
of
god
only
as
god
delegates
authority
to
man
with
the
assurance
that
administration
under
that
authority
shall
be
acknowledged
in
heaven
can
any
contract
be
made
on
earth
and
be
of
assured
effect
after
the
death
of
the
parties
concerned
authority
to
act
in
the
name
of
the
lord
is
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
the
holy
priesthood
as
the
lord
hath
said
all
covenants
contracts
bonds
obligations
oaths
vows
performances
connections
associations
or
expectations
that
are
not
made
and
entered
into
and
sealed
by
the
holy
spirit
of
promise
of
him
who
is
anointed
both
as
well
for
time
and
for
all
eternity
and
that
too
most
holy
by
revelation
and
commandment
through
the
medium
of
mine
anointed
whom
i
have
appointed
on
the

from

for

that

unto
this

have
an
end
when
men
are
dead
in
application
of
this
principle
to
the
covenants
of
matrimony
the
revelation
continues
therefore
if
a
man
marry
him
a
wife
in
the
world
and
he
marry
her
not
by
me
nor
by
my
word
and
he
covenant
with
her
so
long
as
he
is
in
the
world
and
she
with
him
their
covenant
and
marriage
are
not
of
force
when
they
are
dead
and
when
they
are
out
of
the
world
therefore
they
are
not
bound
by
any
law
when
they
are
out
of
the
world
therefore
when
they
are
out
of
the
world
they
neither
marry
nor
are
given
in
marriage
but
are
appointed
angels
in
heaven
which
angels
are
ministering
servants
to
minister
for
those
who
are
worthy
of
a
far
more
and
an
exceeding
and
an
eternal
weight
of
glory
for
these
angels
did
not
abide
my
law
therefore
they
can
not
be
enlarged
but
remain
separately
and
singly
without
exaltation
in
their
saved
condition
to
all
eternity
and
from
henceforth
are
not
gods
but
are
angels
of
god
for
ever
and

of

matrimony
involving

solemnizes

but
no

nor
any

persons
is

unless
the
parties
furnish
proof
that
they
have

legally
and
lawfully
married
no

is
performed
in
any

temples
except
under
license
duly
issued
as
required
by
the
laws
of
the
state
the
sealing
ordinance
extends
to
other
associations
than
those
of
matrimony
as
will
be
shown
the
actuality
of
the
sealing
ordinance
in
marriage
finds
an
illustration
in
the
personal
teachings
of
the
savior
on
one
occasion
there
came
unto
him
certain
sadducees
and
these
be
it
remembered
denied
the
possibility
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
they
sought
to
entrap
him
by
a
difficult
question
they
thus
stated
their
case
master
moses
said
if
a
man
die
having
no
children
his
brother
shall
marry
his
wife
and
raise
up
seed
unto
his
brother
now
there
were
with
us
seven
brethren
and
the
first
when
he
had
married
a
wife
deceased
and
having
no
issue
left
his
wife
unto
his
brother
likewise
the
second
also
and
the
third
unto
the
seventh
and
last
of
all
the
woman
died
also
therefore
in
the
resurrection
whose
wife
shall
she
be
of
the
seven
for
they
all
had
her
note
the
sequel
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
ye
do
err
not
knowing
the
scriptures
nor
the
power
of
god
for
in
the
resurrection
they
neither
marry
nor
are
given
in
marriage
but
are
as
the
angels
of
god
in
heaven
it
is
evident
that
in
the
resurrected
state
there
could
be
no
contest
among
the
seven
brothers
as
to
whose
wife
the
woman
was
for
after
death
there
was
to
be
no
marrying
nor
giving
in
marriage
the
question
of
marriage
between
individuals
was
and
is
to
be
settled
before
that
time
the
woman
would
and
could
be
the
wife
of
but
one
in
the
eternal
world
and
that
one
the
man
to
whom
she
was
given
by
the
authority
of
the
holy
priesthood
on
earth
as
a
consort
for
time
and
eternity
in
short
the
woman
would
be
the
wife
of
the
man
with
whom
she
entered
into
covenant
for
eternity
under
the
seal
of
divine
authority
and
no
contract
or
agreement
for
time
only
would
be
effective
in
the
resurrection
this
exposition
seems
to
have
been
convincing
the
multitude
were
astonished
and
the
sadducees
were
silenced
moreover
some
of
the
scribes
declared
master
thou
hast
well
said
our
lord
added
what
appears
to
have
been
a
supplementary
question
coupled
with
instruction
of
the
greatest
import
but
as
touching
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
have
ye
not
read
that
which
was
spoken
unto
you
by
god
saying
i
am
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
god
is
not
the
god
of
the
dead
but
of
the
living
other
sealing
ordinances
children
born
outside
celestial
marriage
yet
within
legally
established
wedlock
are
the
lawful
and
legitimate
heirs
of
their
parents
in
all
affairs
of
earth
they
are
the
offspring
of
an
earthly
union
that
is
in
every
respect
a
legal
moral
and
proper
relation
under
the
laws
of
man
that
these
children
will
belong
to
their
parents
in
the
hereafter
is
as
uncertain
as
that
the
parents
will
belong
to
each
other
the
parents
have
been
but
temporally
and
temporarily
married
and
the
offspring
are
theirs
for
the
period
of
their
own
contract
only
even
as
husband
and
wife
though
legally
wedded
under
the
secular
law
must
be
sealed
by
the
authority
of
the
holy
priesthood
if
their
union
is
to
be
valid
in
eternity
so
must
children
who
have
been
born
to
parents
married
for
time
only
be
sealed
to
their
parents
after
father
and
mother
have
been
sealed
to
each
other
in
the
order
of
celestial
marriage
the
church
affirms
the
eternal
perpetuity
of
all
family
relationships
existing
on
earth
under
the
seal
and
authority
of
the
priesthood
and
declares
that
none
other
relationship
will
be
binding
after
death
the
offspring
of
parents
not
joined
in
celestial
marriage
are
thus
sealed
to
or
adopted
by
their
parents
as
members
of
the
family
organization
which
shall
endure
through
eternity
thus
husbands
and
wives
who
are
dead
are
married
or
sealed
to
each
other
by
proxy
ministration
and
their
children
are
similarly
sealed
to
them
in
the
family
relationship
it
will
be
seen
therefore
that
the
vicarious
labor
of
the
living
for
the
dead
as
performed
in
the
temples
of
the
present
day
comprises
more
than
baptism
and
confirmation
the
work
is
completed
on
earth
only
when
the
parties
in
the
persons
of
their
living
representatives
have
been
baptized
confirmed
endowed
and
sealed
both
in
the
relationship
of
husband
and
wife
as
once
existent
and
in
the
family
union
of
parents
and
children

this
passage
has

the

adam

this

this

the

and

as
to
general
design
and
indeed
as
to
details
of
plan
and
construction
of
the
earlier
sanctuaries
much
has
been
preserved
to
us
through
the
pages
of
sacred
writ
from
the
biblical
record
alone
it
would
be
possible
to
practically
reproduce
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
the
later
temple
of
solomon
though
had
we
no
information
to
supplement
the
biblical
account
we
would
know
but
little
as
to
procedure
requisite
to
the
administration
of
ordinances
specifically
pertaining
to
temples
regarding
the
plan
of
building
and
the
structural
design
of
temples
we
find
no
close
similarity
far
less
of
aught
approaching
identity
in
these
holy
houses
as
erected
in
different
dispensations
on
the
contrary
we
may
affirm
that
direct
revelation
of
temple
plans
is
required
for
each
distinctive
period
of
the
administration
that
is
to
say
for
every
dispensation
of
divine
authority
while
the
general
purpose
of
temples
is
the
same
in
all
times
the
special
suitability
of
these
edifices
is
determined
by
the
needs
of
the
dispensation
to
which
they
severally
belong
there
is
a
definite
sequence
of
development
in
the
dealings
of
god
with
man
throughout
the
centuries
and
it
is
this
unity
of
order
and
purpose
that
constitutes
the
eternal
unchangeableness
of
the
supreme
being
today
is
no
mere
repetition
of
yesterday
on
the
contrary
every
today
is
a
sum
of
all
precedent
time
so
that
in
each
succeeding
age
the
divine
plan
is
farther
advanced
and
the
grand
finale
in
the
great
drama
of
human
salvation
is
brought
nearer
from
the
days
of
the
ancient
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
thence
onward
to
the
meridian
of
time
animal
sacrifice
was
required
as
an
ordained
rite
of
propitiation
and
worship
and
such
was
in
prototype
of
the
sacrificial
death
predicted
as
part
of
the
mission
of
the
son
of
man
the
temples
of
the
hebrews
who
were
living
under
the
mosaic
law
provided
therefore
for
the
slaughter
of
animals
for
the
ceremonial
dividing
of
the
carcasses
and
for
the
due
disposal
of
the
blood
for
the
convenient
immolation
of
the
offerings
and
for
numerous
other
details
of
ceremony
associated
with
worship
under
the
law
of
moses
the
saints
are
one
with
other
christian
sects
in
the
unreserved
acceptance
of
the
doctrine
that
the
atoning
death
of
christ
terminated
the
mosaic
rites
of
sacrifice
involving
the
ceremonial
shedding
of
blood
that
in
truth
the
prototype
was
consummated
in
the
reality
the
temples
of
today
are
provided
with
no
altars
of
sacrifice
no
courts
of
slaughter
no
shambles
red
with
the
blood
of
beasts
no
pyres
on
which
carcasses
are
burned
no
censers
of
incense
to
becloud
the
fumes
from
burning
flesh
even
among
the
temples
of
the
present
dispensation
there
is
a
graded
variety
in
the
details
of
construction
the
first
temple
of
modern
times
was
in
a
measure
incomplete
as
compared
with
the
holy
houses
of
later
construction
the
fact
was
doubtless
known
to
the
lord
though
wisely
hidden
from
common
knowledge
that
the
kirtland
temple
would
serve
but
for
the
beginning
of
the
of
those
distinctive
ordinances
for
which
temples
are
essential
even
as
the
tabernacle
of
old
was
but
an
inferior
type
of
what
would
follow
designed
for
temporary
use
under
special
conditions
so
the
earlier
temples
of
the
dispensation
specifically
those
of
kirtland
and
nauvoo
were
but
temporary
houses
of
the
lord
destined
to
serve
for
short
periods
only
as
sanctuaries
scarcely
had
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
been
organized
when
the
lord
indicated
the
necessity
of
a
temple
in
which
he
could
reveal
his
mind
and
will
to
man
and
in
which
the
sanctifying
ordinances
of
the
gospel
could
be
administered
in
a
revelation
given
as
early
as
december
the
lord
said
i
am
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
wherefore
gird
up
your
loins
and
i
will
suddenly
come
to
my
temple
in
february
the
lord
further
indicated
his
purpose
thus
that
my
covenant
people
may
be
gathered
in
one
in
that
day
when
i
shall
come
to
my
temple
and
this
i
do

the
salvation
of
my
people
more
definite

to
the
practical
labors
incident
to
the
procuring
of
a
site
and
the
rearing
of
a

soon
followed
temple
site
at
independence
missouri
the
principal
seat
of
the
church
had
been
temporarily
established
at
kirtland
ohio
nevertheless
the
prophet
had
learned
through
early
revelation
that
zion
would
be
established
far
to
the
west
in
june
a
conference
of
elders
was
held
at
kirtland
on
which
occasion
a
revelation
was
received
directing
certain
of
the
elders
to
start
westward
traveling
in
pairs
and
preaching
by
the
way
in
the
month
following
these
elders
reassembled
at
a
designated
place
in
western
missouri
all
rejoicing
in
their
ministry
and
eager
to
learn
the
further
will
of
the
lord
the
burden
of
their
prayer
and
song
is
thus
expressed
by
the
prophet
when
will
the
wilderness
blossom
as
the
rose
when
will
zion
be
built
up
in
her
glory
and
where
will
thy
temple
stand
unto
which
all
nations
shall
come
in
the
last
days
in
answer
to
their
supplications
the
lord
spake
by
the
mouth
of
his
prophet
designating
the
western
part
of
missouri
as
the
land
of
zion
and
the
site
occupied
by
the
town
of
independence
as
the
center
place
and
specifying
a
spot
as
that
upon
which
a
temple
should
be
built
on
the
third
of
august
the
prophet
joseph
smith
and
seven
other
elders
of
the
church
assembled
on
the
temple
lot
and
dedicated
the
same
to
its
sacred
purpose
though
the
company
was
small
the
occasion
was
one
of
great
solemnity
and
impressiveness
the
prophet
himself
offered
the
prayer
of
dedication
the
temple
so
projected
is
yet
to
be
built
though
the
saints
acquired
by
purchase
title
to
and
possession
of
the
temple
lot
they
were
later
by
violence
compelled
to
abandon
their
rightful
possessions
the
kirtland
temple
the
building
of
a
temple
in
missouri
was
regarded
even
by
the
prophet
and
those
who
assisted
him
in
dedicating
the
site
as
an
event
of
the
future
perhaps
even
of
the
far
distant
future
the
center
of
activity
the
seat
of
the
church
for
the
time
being
was
in
ohio
and
kirtland
was
the
place
of
temporary
gathering
in
kirtland
too
was
to
be
erected
the
first
temple
of
modern
times
in
a
revelation
given
december
the
lord
commanded
the
establishment
of
a
holy
house
perhaps
because
their
eyes
were
directed
too
steadily
toward
the
center
place
and
because
the
people
were
prone
to
contemplate
too
absorbedly
the
glory
of
the
future
to
the
neglect
of
then
present
duties
compliance
with
the
requirement
to
proceed
at
once
with
the
erection
of
a
temple
was
not
prompt
and
the
lord
rebuked
the
people
for
their
tardiness
and
neglect
declaring
again
his
will
that
a
house
be
reared
to
his
name
and
promising
success
on
condition
of
faithful
effort
the
saints
were
aroused
to
great
activity
in
the
matter
of
erecting
a
temple
for
immediate
use
a
building
committee
was
organized
and
a
call
issued
to
all
branches
of
the
church
on
the
second
day
of
august
the
voice
of
the
lord
was
heard
again
respecting
the
matter
of
temple
building
and
while
the
specific
requirement
appears
to
directly
apply
to
the
temple
of
the
future
in
jackson
county
missouri
nevertheless
the
revelation
had
immediate
effect
in
inspiring
greater
effort
in
the
building
of
a
temple
at
kirtland
the
kirtland
temple
was
built
as
projected
and
designed
though
the
work
was
marked
by
an
unbroken
course
of
supreme
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
a
people
consider
the
words
of
one
who
was
present
and
saw
one
who
helped
and
suffered
one
who
spoke
from
personal
knowledge
and
keen
remembrance
eliza
snow
a
gifted
poetess
and
historian
of
israel
has
written
it
the
temple
was
commenced
in
june
under
the
immediate
direction
of
the
almighty
through
his
servant
joseph
smith
whom
he
had
called
in
his
boyhood
like
samuel
of
old
to
introduce
the
fulness
of
the
everlasting
gospel
at
that
time
the
saints
were
few
in
number
and
most
of
them
very
poor
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
assurance
that
god
had
spoken
and
had
commanded
that
a
house
should
be
built
to
his
name
of
which
he
not
only
revealed
the
form
but
also
designated
the
dimensions
an
attempt
towards
building
that
temple
under
the
then
existing
circumstances
would
have
been
by
all
concerned
pronounced
preposterous
its
dimensions
are
eighty
by
feet
the
walls
fifty
feet
high
and
the
tower
one
hundred
and
ten
feet
the
two
main
halls
are
by
feet
in
the
inner
court
the
building
has
four
vestries
in
front
and
five
rooms
in
the
attic
which
were
devoted
to
literature
and
for
meetings
of
the
various
quorums
of
the
priesthood
there
was
a
peculiarity
in
the
arrangement
of
the
inner
court
which
made
it
more
than
ordinarily
impressive
so
much
so
that
a
sense
of
sacred
awe
seemed
to
rest
upon
all
who
entered
not
only
the
saints
but
strangers
also
manifested
a
high
degree
of
reverential
feeling
four
pulpits
stood
one
above
another
in
the
center
of
the
building
from
north
to
south
both
on
the
east
and
west
ends
in
front
of
each
of
these
two
rows
of
pulpits
was
a
sacrament
table
for
the
administration
of
that
sacred
ordinance
in
each
corner
of
the
court
was
an
elevated
pew
for
the
singers
the
choir
being
distributed
into
four
compartments
in
addition
to
the
were
others
intersecting
at
right
angles
which
divided
the
main
hall
into
four
equal
sections
giving
to
each
one
half
of
one
set
of
pulpits
from
the
day
the
ground
was
broken
for
laying
the
foundation
of
the
temple
until
its
dedication
on
the
of
march
the
work
was
vigorously
prosecuted
with
very
little
capital
except
brain
bone
and
sinew
combined
with
unwavering
trust
in
god
men
women
and
even
children
worked
with
their
might
while
the
brethren
labored
in
their
departments
the
sisters
were
actively
engaged
in
boarding
and
clothing
workmen
not
otherwise
provided
for
all
living
as
abstemiously
as
possible
so
that
every
cent
might
be
appropriated
to
the
grand
object
while
their
energies
were
stimulated
by
the
prospect
of
participating
in
the
blessing
of
a
house
built
by
the
direction
of
the
most
high
and
accepted
by
him
the
corner
stones
had
been
laid
july
just
when
opposition
and
persecution
were
most
rife
in
the
western
branches
of
the
church
the
very
day
in
fact
on
which
a
lawless
mob
served
notice
of
expulsion
on
the
saints
in
missouri
nevertheless
work
on
the
kirtland
temple
continued
without
interruption
though
to
the
eager
saints
progress
was
all
too
slow
on
the
of
march
a
solemn
convocation
was
held
in
kirtland
called
for
the
purpose
of
blessing
in
the
name
of
the
lord
those
who
have
heretofore
assisted
in
building
by
their
labor
and
other
means
the
house
of
the
lord
in
this
place
the
record
gives
names
of
those
who
had
consecrated
their
time
effort
and
means
to
the
work
long
before
the
temple
was
completed
parts
of
the
structure
were
used
for
council
meetings
and
other
gatherings
of
the
priesthood
in
january
a
code
of
rules
was
adopted
to
be
observed
in
the
house
of
the
lord
in
kirtland
on
the
of
the
month
last
named
a
gathering
of
the
priesthood
was
held
in
the
unfinished
temple
on
which
occasion
the
presiding
patriarch
and
the
three
high
priests
who
composed
the
first
presidency
of
the
church
assembled
in
a
room
by
themselves
and
engaged
in
solemn
prayer
the
patriarch
father
joseph
smith
was
anointed
and
blessed
by
the
members
of
the
first
presidency
in
turn
after
which
he
by
virtue
of
his
office
anointed
and
blessed
them
of
the
glorious
manifestation
that
followed
the
prophet
thus
writes
the
heavens
were
opened
upon
us
and
i
beheld
the
celestial
kingdom
of
god
and
the
glory
thereof
whether
in
the
body
or
out
i
can
not
tell
i
saw
the
transcendent
beauty
of
the
gate
through
which
the
heirs
of
that
kingdom
will
enter
which
was
like
unto
circling
flames
of
fire
also
the
blazing
throne
of
god
whereon
was
seated
the
father
and
the
son
i
saw
the
beautiful
streets
of
that
kingdom
which
had
the
appearance
of
being
paved
with
gold
i
saw
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
who
are
now
upon
the
earth
who
hold
the
keys
of
this
last
ministry
in
foreign
lands
standing
together
in
a
circle
much
fatigued
with
their
clothes
tattered
and
feet
swollen
with
their
eyes
cast
downward
and
jesus
standing
in
their
midst
and
they
did
not
behold
him
the
savior
looked
upon
them
and
wept
many
of
my
brethren
who
received
the
ordinance
with
me
saw
glorious
visions
also
angels
ministered
unto
them
as
well
as
to
myself
and
the
power
of
the
highest
rested
upon
us
the
house
was
filled
with
the
glory
of
god
and
we
shouted
to
god
and
the
lamb
my
scribe
also
received
his
anointing
with
us
and
saw
in
a
vision
the
armies
of
heaven
protecting
the
saints
in
their
return
to
zion
and
many
things
which
i
saw
the
bishop
of
kirtland
with
his
counselors
and
the
bishop
of
zion
with
his
counselors
were
present
with
us
and
received
their
anointings
under
the
hands
of
father
smith
and
this
was
confirmed
by
the
presidency
and
the
glories
of
heaven
were
unfolded
to
them
also
we
then
invited
the
high
councilors
of
kirtland
and
zion
into
our
room
the
visions
of
heaven
were
opened
to
them
also
some
of
them
saw
the
face
of
the
savior
and
others
were
ministered
unto
by
holy
angels
and
the
spirit
of
prophecy
and
revelation
was
poured
out
in
mighty
power
and
loud
hosannas
and
glory
to
god
in
the
highest
saluted
the
heavens
for
we
all
communed
with
the
heavenly
host

of
the
kirtland
temple
occurred
on
sunday
march
the
early
hour
of
had
been
set
as
the
time
for
opening
the
doors
but
so
intense
was
the
interest
and
so
eager
the
expectation
that
long
before
the
time
hundreds
had
gathered
about
the
doors
between
nine
hundred
and
a
thousand
people
attended
the
services
the
congregation
was
seated
in

with
its
presiding
officers
being
in
its
appointed
place
singing
scripture
reading
and
supplication
for
divine
grace
were
followed
by
brief
addresses
after
which
the
authorities
of
the
church
as
then
constituted
were
presented
to
the
people
for
acceptance
or
rejection
and
a
rising
vote
pledged
unanimous
support
in
every
instance
the
authorities
of
the
priesthood
so
sustained
comprised
all
presiding
officers
from
the
first
presidency
down
to
the
presidency
of
the
deacons
the
dedicatory
prayer
was
then
offered
by
joseph
smith
who
affirms
that
the
prayer
was
given
to
him
by
revelation
the
question
as
to
whether
the
house
of
the
lord
was
accepted
as
duly
dedicated
was
put
to
the
quorums
of
the
priesthood
separately
and
to
the
congregation
as
a
whole
the
vote
in
the
affirmative
was
unanimous

and
a
short
prayer
at

brother

arose
and
began
to
prophesy
when
a
noise
was
heard
like
the
sound
of
a
rushing
mighty
wind
which
filled
the
temple
and
all
the
congregation
simultaneously
arose
being
moved
upon
by
an
invisible
power
many
began
to
speak
in
tongues
and
prophesy

filled
with

running
together
hearing
an
unusual
sound
within
and
seeing

bright
light
like
a
pillar
of
fire
resting
upon
the
temple
and
were
astonished
at
what
was
taking
place

eventful
sabbath

solemn
assembly

such
members
as

not
been
able
to
secure
admission
on
the
earlier
day

services
were
in
a
measure
a
repetition
of
the
proceedings
on
the
first
occasion
the
dedicatory
prayer
was
read
appropriate
music
was
rendered
and
addresses
were
delivered
that
the
building
was
in
truth
a
temple
a
holy
structure
accepted
by
him
to
whose
name
it
had
been
reared
that
it
was
veritably
a
house
of
the
lord
had
been
attested
by
the
visitation
of
heavenly
beings
and
by
divine
manifestations
surpassing
all
expectation
as
witnessed
on
the
evening
of
the
dedication
day
on
the
next
sabbath
april
visitations
and
manifestations
of
yet
greater
import
were
received
at
the
afternoon
service
the
lord
supper
was
administered
after
which
the
prophet
and
his
counselor
oliver
cowdery
retired
to
the
stand
reserved
for
the
presiding
officers
of
the
melchisedek
priesthood
which
was
enclosed
by
the
curtains
or
veils
lowered
for
the
occasion
they
solemnly
testify
that
then
and
there
did
the
lord
jesus
christ
reveal
himself
afterward
other
heavenly
personages
ministered
unto
them
each
delivering
or
bestowing
the
particular
authority
with
which
he
was
specially
invested
the
testimony
of
joseph
smith
and
oliver
cowdery
is
as
follows
the
veil
was
taken
from
our
minds
and
the
eyes
of
our
understanding
were
opened
we
saw
the
lord
standing
upon
the
of
the
pulpit
before
us
and
under
his
feet
was
a
paved
work
of
pure
gold
in
color
like
amber
his
eyes
were
as
a
flame
of
fire
the
hair
of
his
head
was
white
like
the
pure
snow
his
countenance
shone
above
the
brightness
of
the
sun
and
his
voice
was
as
the
sound
of
the
rushing
of
great
waters
even
the
voice
of
jehovah
saying
i
am
the
first
and
the
last
i
am
he
who
liveth
i
am
he
who
was
slain
i
am
your
advocate
with
the
father
behold
your
sins
are
forgiven
you
you
are
clean
before
me
therefore
lift
up
your
heads
and
rejoice
let
the
hearts
of
your
brethren
rejoice
and
let
the
hearts
of
all
my
people
rejoice
who
have
with
their
might
built
this
house
to
my
name
for
behold
i
have
accepted
this
house
and
my
name
shall
be
here
and
i
will
manifest
myself
to
my
people
in
mercy
in
this
house
yea
i
will
appear
unto
my
servants
and
speak
unto
them
with
mine
own
voice
if
my
people
will
keep
my
commandments
and
do
not
pollute
this
holy
house
yea
the
hearts
of
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
shall
greatly
rejoice
in
consequence
of
the
blessings
which
shall
be
poured
out
and
the
endowment
with
which
my
servants
have
been
endowed
in
this
house
and
the
fame
of
this
house
shall
spread
to
foreign
lands
and
this
is
the
beginning
of
the
blessing
which
shall
be
poured
out
upon
the
heads
of
my
people
even
so
amen
after
this
vision
closed
the
heavens
were
again
opened
unto
us
and
moses
appeared
before
us
and
committed
unto
us
the
keys
of
the
gathering
of
israel
from
the
four
parts
of
the
earth
and
the
leading
of
the
ten
tribes
from
the
land
of
the
north
after
this
elias
appeared
and
committed
the
dispensation
of
the
gospel
of
abraham
saying
that
in
us
and
our
seed
all
generations
after
us
should
be
blessed
after
this
vision
had
closed
another
great
and
glorious
vision
burst
upon
us
for
elijah
the
prophet
who
was
taken
to
heaven
without
tasting
death
stood
before
us
and
said
behold
the
time
has
fully
come
which
was
spoken
of
by
the
mouth
of
malachi
testifying
that
he
elijah
should
be
sent
before
the
great
and
dreadful
day
of
the
lord
come
to
turn
the
hearts
of
the
fathers
to
the
children
and
the
children
to
the
fathers
lest
the
whole
earth
be
smitten
with
a
curse
therefore
the
keys
of
this
dispensation
are
committed
into
your
hands
and
by
this
ye
may
know
that
the
great
and
dreadful
day
of
the
lord
is
near
even
at
the
doors
the
erection
of
the
temple
at
kirtland
seemed
to
increase
the
hostile
opposition
to
which
the
church
had
been
subjected
since
its
organization
and
persecution
soon
became
so
violent
that
all
of
the
saints
who
could
dispose
of
their
property
and
leave
did
so
and
joined
their
fellow
religionists
in
missouri
within
two
years
following
the
dedication
a
general
exodus
of
the
saints
had
taken
place
and
the
temple
soon
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
persecutors
the
building
is
yet
standing
and
serves
the
purposes
of
an
ordinary
for
an
obscure
sect
that
manifests
no
visible
activity
in
temple
building
nor
apparent
belief
in
the
sacred
ordinances
for
which
temples
are
erected
the
people
whose
sacrifice
and
suffering
reared
the
structure
no
longer
assert
claims
of
ownership
what
was
once
the
temple
of
god
in
which
the
lord
jesus
appeared
in
person
has
become
but
a
house
a
building
whose
sole
claim
to
distinction
among
the
innumerable
structures
built
by
man
lies
in
its
wondrous
past
temple
site
at
far
west
missouri
from
ohio
the
church
migrated
westward
and
were
established
in
missouri
principally
in
jackson
clay
and
caldwell
counties
no
time
was
lost
in
useless
grieving
over
the
enforced
abandonment
of
the
temple
at
kirtland
even
at
that
early
day
but
seven
years
after
the
organization
of
the
church
the
people
had
come
to
regard
persecution
as
an
inevitable
incident
of
their
religion
and
spoliation
as
their
heritage
resolutely
they
went
to
work
in
preparation
for
another
temple
and
a
site
was
chosen
at
far
west
caldwell
county
missouri
on
the
of
august
the
presidency
high
council
and
all
the
authorities
of
the
church
in
missouri
assembled
in
council
at
far
west
and
unanimously
resolved
to
go
on
moderately
and
build
a
house
unto
the
name
of
the
lord
in
far
west
as
they
had
means
on
the
of
april
a
revelation
was
received
directing
the
time
and
manner
of
beginning
the
work
let
the
city
far
west
be
a
holy
and
consecrated
land
unto
me
and
it
shall
be
called
most
holy
for
the
ground
upon
which
thou
standest
is
holy
therefore
i
command
you
to
build
an
house
unto
me
for
the
gathering
together
of
my
saints
that
they
may
worship
me
and
let
there
be
a
beginning
of
this
work
and
a
foundation
and
a
preparatory
work
this
following
summer
and
let
the
beginning
be
made
on
the
fourth
day
of
july
next
and
from
that
time
forth
let
my
people
labor
diligently
to
build
an
house
unto
my
name
and
in
one
year
from
this
day
let
them
laying
the
foundation
of
my
house
on
the
fourth
day
of
july
the
corner
stones
were
laid
to
the
accompaniment
of
military
parade
and
solemn
procession
it
is
plain
from
the
revelation
of
april
that
even
the
laying
of
the
foundation
of
this
proposed
temple
would
not
proceed
uninterruptedly
the
corner
stones
were
placed
on
july
as
had
been
commanded
and
on
the
another
mention
of
the
site
is
made
with
a
specific
requirement
respecting
the
future
work
of
the
apostles
let
them
take
leave
of
my
saints
in
the
city
of
far
west
on
the
day
of
april
next
on
the
building
spot
of
my
house
saith
the
lord
the
months
following
were
marked
by
persecution
and
violence
hostile
opponents
declared
that
the
commission
should
never
be
fulfilled
history
attests
however
that
on
the
day
of
april
the
apostles
several
other
officers
of
the
church
and
a
number
of
the
members
assembled
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
sang
their
hymns
delivered
their
exhortations
and
began
the
work
of
laying
the
foundation
stones
on
the
occasion
two
vacancies
in
the
council
of
the
twelve
were
filled
by
the
ordination
of
wilford
woodruff
and
george
smith
whose
nominations
had
previously
been
voted
upon
the
apostles
then
took
leave
of
the
others
present
and
proceeded
on
their
missions
almost
immediately
after
the
events
last
recorded
the
saints
were
forced
to
abandon
their
homes
in
missouri
the
saints
regard
the
long
delay
in
the
erection
of
temples
on
the
dedicated
sites
in
missouri
as
largely
the
result
of
their
own
defection
neglect
and
disobedience
to
the
word
of
the
lord
in
consequence
of
which
their
enemies
were
permitted
to
prevail
when
in
the
saints
in
missouri
were
subject
to
cruel
persecution
their
fellow
religionists
in
the
eastern
branches
of
the
church
were
directed
to
go
to
their
aid
and
to
send
men
with
money
to
purchase
the
lands
adjacent
to
the
chosen
sites
and
moreover
to
consecrate
their
possessions
to
the
redemption
of
zion
to
these
requirements
there
was
unsatisfactory
response
and
even
in
zion
camp
as
the
body
of
between
one
hundred
and
fifty
and
two
hundred
men
who
set
out
from
ohio
for
missouri
as
directed
was
called
there
was
much
disaffection
murmuring
and
lack
of
faith
on
june
the
lord
said
through
joseph
the
prophet
behold
i
say
unto
you
were
it
not
for
the
transgressions
of
my
people
speaking
concerning
the
church
and
not
individuals
they
might
have
been
redeemed
even
now
thus
through
their
own
transgressions
the
saints
were
hindered
in
the
work
required
at
their
hands
and
the
harvest
of
blessings
predicated
upon
this
specific
labor
has
not
yet
ripened
the
nauvoo
temple
after
their
expulsion
from
missouri
the
mormon
refugees
turned
their
faces
toward
the
east
crossed
the
mississippi
and
established
themselves
in
and
about
the
obscure
village
of
commerce
hancock
county
illinois
the
people
demonstrated
again
their
marvelous
recuperative
power
and
without
delay
or
hesitation
set
about
establishing
new
homes
and
a
temple
by
the
early
part
of
june
dwellings
were
in
course
of
construction
and
soon
the
hamlet
was
transformed
into
a
city
to
this
new
abiding
place
the
saints
gave
the
name
nauvoo
which
to
them
meant
all
that
the
name
city
beautiful
could
convey
it
was
situated
but
a
few
miles
from
quincy
in
a
bend
of
the
majestic
river
giving
the
town
three
water
fronts
it
seemed
to
nestle
there
as
if
the
father
of
waters
was
encircling
it
with
his
mighty
arm
the
best
and
most
suitable
site
within
the
limits
of
the
city
as
planned
was
selected

and
duly
set
apart

others
desirable
rest
upon
the
same
forever
amen
regarding
the
proper
order
of
procedure
in
temple
building
the
prophet
joseph
smith
wrote
as
follows
in
connection
with
the
laying
of
the
at
nauvoo
if
the
strict
order
of
the
priesthood
were
carried
out
in
the
building
of
temples
the
first
stone
would
be
laid
at
the
corner
by
the
first
presidency
of
the
church
the
corner
should
be
laid
next
the
third
or
corner
next
and
the
fourth
or
corner
last
the
first
presidency
should
lay
the
corner
stone
and
dictate
who
are
the
proper
persons
to
lay
the
other
corner
stones
if
a
temple
is
built
at
a
distance
and
the
first
presidency
are
not
present
then
the
quorum
of
the
twelve
apostles
are
the
persons
to
dictate
the
order
for
that
temple
and
in
the
absence
of
the
twelve
apostles
then
the
presidency
of
the
stake
will
lay
the
corner
stone
the
melchisedek
priesthood
laying
the
corner
stones
on
the
east
side
of
the
temple
and
the
lesser
priesthood
those
on
the
west
side
the
nauvoo
temple
was
erected
by
the
people
who
contributed
liberally
both
through
tithes
and
freewill
offerings
of
money
and
labor
most
of
the
work
was
done
by
men
who
tithed
themselves
as
to
time
and
devoted
their
energies
in
the
proportion
of
at
least
one
day
in
ten
to
labor
on
the
temple
the
work
progressed
slowly
but
without
marked
interruption
and
this
fact
becomes
surprising
when
the
many
unfavorable
conditions
are
considered
the
saints
had
found
but
temporary
respite
from
persecution
and
as
the
temple
rose
opposition
increased
interest
had
been
aroused
and
energy
stimulated
in
temple
matters
through
a
revelation
by
which
the
lord
made
known
his
will
and
the
provisions
of
heavenly
law
concerning
the
sacred
ordinance
of
baptism
for
the
dead
it
will
be
remembered
that
no
provision
for
this
rite
had
been
made
in
the
kirtland
temple
for
at
the
time
of
the
erection
of
that
structure
nothing
thereto
pertaining
had
been
revealed
in
modern
times
on
january
the
lord
had
spoken
through
the
prophet
explaining
the
need
of
a
holy
house
with
its
baptistry
largely
and
specifically
for
the
benefit
of
the
dead
so
eager
were
the
saints
to
render
vicarious
service
in
behalf
of
their
dead
that
before
the
temple
walls
were
much
above
the
basement
level
the
construction
of
a
font
was
in
progress
on
november
the
font
was
ready
for
dedication
and
the
ceremony
was
performed
by
the
prophet
himself
thus
long
before
the
temple
was
finished
ordinance
work
was
in
progress
within
its
precincts
the
font
being
enclosed
by
temporary
walls
a
description
written
by
joseph
smith
follows
the
baptismal
font
is
situated
in
the
center
of
the
basement
room
under
the
main
hall
of
the
temple
it
is
constructed
of
pine
timber
and
put
together
of
staves
tongued
and
grooved
oval
shaped
sixteen
feet
long
east
and
west
and
twelve
feet
wide
seven
feet
high
from
the
foundation
the
basin
four
feet
deep
the
moulding
of
the
cap
and
base
are
formed
of
beautiful
carved
work
in
antique
style
the
sides
are
finished
with
panel
work
a
flight
of
stairs
in
the
north
and
south
sides
lead
up
and
down
into
the
basin
guarded
by
side
railing
the
font
stands
upon
twelve
oxen
four
on
each
side
and
two
at
each
end
their
heads
shoulders
and
projecting
out
from
under
the
font
they
are
carved
out
of
pine
plank
glued
together
and
copied
after
the
most
beautiful
steer
that
could
be
found
in
the
country
and
they
are
an
excellent
striking
likeness
of
the
original
the
horns
were
formed
after
the
most
perfect
horn
that
could
be
procured
the
oxen
and
ornamental
mouldings
of
the
font
were
carved
by
elder
elijah
fordham
from
the
city
of
new
york
which
occupied
eight
months
of
time
the
font
was
enclosed
by
a
temporary
frame
building
sided
up
with
split
oak
clapboards
with
a
roof
of
the
same
material
and
was
so
low
that
the
timbers
of
the
first
story
of
the
temple
were
laid
above
it
the
water
was
supplied
from
a
well
thirty
feet
deep
in
the
east
end
of
the
basement
beside
the
baptistry
other
parts
of
the
temple
were
prepared
for
temporary
occupancy
while
yet
work
on
the
walls
was
in
progress
and
on
sunday
october
a
general
assembly
was
convened
therein
this
is
recorded
as
the
first
meeting
held
in
the
temple
at
later
dates
other
meetings
were
held
within
the
unfinished
structure
and
notwithstanding
the
violent
opposition
of
foes
without
and
yet
more
effective
hindrances
caused
by
the
apostate
spirit
manifested
by
a
few
within
the
church
the
work
was
vigorously
prosecuted
it
was
not
permitted
that
joseph
smith
the
prophet
nor
hyrum
smith
counselor
in
the
first
presidency
and
later
patriarch
of
the
church
should
live
to
see
the
completion
of
the
building
on
the
of
june
these
men
of
god
fell
victims
of
the
bullets
of
assassins
at
carthage
illinois
though
heavy
the
blow
and
cruel
the
affliction
suffered
by
the
saints
in
the
martyrdom
of
their
leaders
the
work
of
the
church
showed
scarcely
perceptible
hindrance
within
two
weeks
after
the
dread
event
construction
on
the
temple
was
resumed
and
from
that
time
till
the
completion
the
work
was
prosecuted
with
increased
vigor
and
determination
a
few
months
prior
to
his
martyrdom
patriarch
hyrum
smith
acting
as
one
of
the
temple
committee
had
made
a
call
on
the
women
of
the
church
asking
from
them
a
weekly
subscription
of
one
cent
apiece
the
money
to
be
used
in
purchasing
material
particularly
glass
and
nails
for
the
temple
it
is
recorded
that
there
was
soon
a
great
anxiety
manifest
among
the
sisters
to
pay
their
portion
and
nearly
all
paid
a
year
subscription
in
advance
the
church
archives
for
and
contain
numerous
references
to
the
progress
of
the
work
on
the
of
may
the
capstone
was
laid
with
impressive
ceremony
under
the
direction
of
president
brigham
young
and
other
members
of
the
council
of
the
twelve
apostles
beside
whom
there
were
in
attendance
many
general
and
local
authorities
of
the
church
after
the
had
been
duly
laid
the
president
said
the
last
stone
is
laid
upon
the
temple
and
i
pray
the
almighty
in
the
name
of
jesus
to
defend
us
in
this
place
and
sustain
us
until
the
temple
is
finished
and
we
have
all
got
our
endowments
then
followed
the
solemn
and
sacred
shout
hosanna
hosanna
hosanna
to
god
and
the
lamb
amen
amen
and
amen
this
was
repeated
a
second
and
a
third
time
and
in
conclusion
the
president
said
so
let
it
be
thou
lord
almighty
the
somber
clouds
of
persecution
were
gathering
and
thickening
about
the
devoted
people
under
counsel
from
their
leaders
the
people
prepared
once
again
to
leave
their
homes
and
this
time
they
resolved
to
go
beyond
the
boundaries
of
civilization
a
general
exodus
was
imminent
and
as
early
as
february
this
had
begun
most
of
the
saints
however
remained
for
a
short
time
and
with
these
the
completion
of
the
temple
was
the
main
purpose
and
object
of
life
though
they
knew
the
sacred
edifice
would
soon
be
abandoned
they
labored
diligently
to
complete
it
even
to
the
smallest
detail
by
october
the
building
was
so
well
advanced
that
large
assemblies
therein
were
possible
the
general
autumnal
conference
of
the
church
for
that
year
was
held
within
the
walls
and
the
congregation
present
on
october
numbered
fully
five
thousand
souls
during
december
and
the
early
months
of
many
of
the
saints
received
their
blessings
and
endowments
in
the
temple
for
which
purpose
parts
of
the
structure
had
been
duly
consecrated
but
not
until
the
end
of
april
was
the
building
as
a
whole
ready
for
dedication
the
nauvoo
temple
was
constructed
for
the
most
part
of
a
limestone
a
material
at
once
hard
and
durable
yet
easily
tooled
and
therefore
readily
adapted
to
ornamental
finish
the
entire
building
was
one
hundred
and
feet
by
feet
and
feet
high
in
the
clear
the
top
of
the
spire
was
one
hundred
and
feet
above
the
ground
and
bore
the
figure
of
a
flying
herald
sounding
a
trumpet
the
plan
of
construction
was
that
of
a
solid
and
stable
building
two
and
a
half
stories
high
with
a
hexagonal
tower
at
the
front
rising
in
four
terraces
and
a
dome
over
the
front
center
door
and
immediately
beneath
the
base
of
the
tower
appeared
an
inscription
the
house
of
the
lord
built
by
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
holiness
to
the
lord
on
the
outside
were
thirty
pilasters
nine
on
each
side
and
six
at
each
end
at
its
base

authorities

president
joseph
young
of
the
first
council
of
seventy
offered
the
dedicatory
prayer
the
character
of
the
dedication
was
due
to
the
thought
that
possibly
there
would
be
interference
in
a
public
ceremony
so
active
was
the
spirit
of
intolerance
and
persecution
on
the
day
following
that
is
to
say
may
services
of
a
general
and
public
nature
were
held
in
the
temple

the
direction
of

and

made
of
them
by
the
lord
in
the
building
of
another

to
his
name

work
continued
a
few
months
more
even
though
the
exodus
of
the
people
was
in
progress
in
september
the
nauvoo
temple
was
in
possession
of
the
mob
and
the
people
whose
energy
and
substance
whose
sweat
and
blood
had
been
spent
in
its
rearing
were
driven
into
the
wilderness
or
slain
for
two
years
the
once
hallowed
structure
stood
as
an
abandoned
building
then
on
november
it
fell
a
prey
to
the
wanton
act
of
an
incendiary
after
the
conflagration
only
blackened
walls
remained
where
once
had
stood
so
stately
a
sanctuary
strange
to
say
an
attempt
was
made
by
the
icarians
a
local
organization
to
rebuild
on
the
ruins
the
professed
intent
being
to
provide
for
a
school
but
while
the
work
was
in
its
early
stages
a
tornado
demolished
the
greater
part
of
the
walls
this
occurred
on
may
what
remained
of
the
temple
has
been
taken
away
as
souvenirs
or
used
as
building
material
for
other
structures
stones
of
the
temple
have
been
carried
into
most
of
the
states
of
the
union

beyond
the
seas
but
upon
the
site
where
once
stood
the
house
of
the
lord
not
one
stone
is
left
upon
another
before
the
demolition
of
the
nauvoo
temple
was
complete
the
saints
had
established
themselves
in
the
vales
of
utah
and
were
already
preparing
to
build
another
and
a
greater
sanctuary
to
the
name
and

of
their
god

stands
a
massive
structure
dedicated
to
the
name
of
the
most
high
it
is
at
once
an
object
of
wonder
and
admiration
to
the
visitor
and
a
subject
of
sanctifying
joy
and
righteous
pride
to
the

some
further
data
however
may
be
of
interest
to
the
reader
the
temple
block
a
square
of
ten
acres
was
laid
off
in
and
is
today
one
of
the
choicest
sites
within
the
city
at
the
general
conference
of
the
church
held
in
april
an
official
vote
was
taken
whereby
the
erection
of
the
temple
was
authorized
be
it
remembered
that
this
action
was
that
of
a
people
despoiled
and
in
poverty
struggling
with
the
unsubdued
desert
the
while
menaced
by
hostile
savages
and
that
at
the
time
the
entire
population
of
utah
did
not
exceed
thirty
thousand
souls
of
whom
fewer
than
five
thousand
were
living
within
the
area
of
the
prospective
city
a
general
epistle
issued
by
the
first
presidency
of
the
church
april
is
instructive
in
this
connection
a
railroad
has
been
chartered
to
extend
from
the
temple
block
in
this
city
to
the
stone
quarry
and
mountain
on
the
east
for
the
conveyance
of
building
materials
the
construction
to
commence
immediately
we
contemplate
laying
a
wall
around
the
temple
block
this
season
preparatory
to
laying
the
foundation
of
a
temple
the
year
following
and
this
we
will
be
sure
to
do
if
all
the
saints
shall
prove
themselves
as
ready
to
pay
their
tithing
and
sacrifice
and
consecrate
of
their
substance
as
freely
as
we
will
and
if
the
saints
do
not
pay
their
tithing
we
can
neither
build
nor
prepare
for
building
and
if
there
shall
be
no
temple
built
the
saints
can
have
no
endowments
and
if
they
do
not
receive
their
endowments
they
can
never
attain
unto
that
salvation
they
are
anxiously
looking
for
it
had
been
decided
to
surround
the
entire
block
by
a
substantial
wall
the
beginning
of
work
on
this
enclosure
was
deferred
through
lack
of
material
and
men
until
august
but
from
that
date
it
progressed
with
fair
rapidity
and
on
may
the
wall
was
finished
practically
as
it
now
stands
it
extends
a
full
city
block
one
eighth
of
a
mile
in
each
of
its
four
directions
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
these
dimensions
are
practically
the
same
as
those
which
according
to
josephus
enclosed
the
grounds
on
which
stood
the
temple
of
herod
the
wall
has
a
base
of
cut
stone
a
red
sandstone
from
the
mountains
on
the
east
the
base
is
four
feet
in
height
and
supports
courses
of
adobes
which
extend
ten
feet
higher
then
follows
a
coping
of
red
sandstone
one
foot
in
thickness
giving
the
wall
a
total
height
of
fifteen
feet
the
adobes
are
hidden
by
a
durable
dressing
of
cement
passage
to
and
from
the
square
is
provided
for
by
large
gates
in
the
center
of
each
of
the
four
sides
when
this
wall
was
built
city
creek
ran
through
temple
block
the
stream
is
now
confined
to
a
straight
channel
north
of
the
block
and
the
arches
under
which
the
stream
once
passed
may
be
seen
in
the
base
of
the
wall
both
on
the
east
and
west
sides
the
construction
of
the
wall
in
itself
a
great
and
costly
undertaking
for
people
situated
as
were
its
builders
was
but
an
incident
to
the
greater
labor
of
erecting
the
temple
interest
in
the
work
was
never
allowed
to
flag
it
was
the
theme
of
both
poet
and
preacher
and
the
duty
was
kept
in
public
view
the
people
were
given
to
understand
that
the
commission
to
build
the
house
was
theirs
and
not
that
of
their
leaders
alone
the
site
was
dedicated
and
ground
first
broken
for
the
foundation
february
the
occasion
was
a
notable
one
and
was
observed
by
the
saints
as
a
day
of
general
rejoicing
between
the
date
of
breaking
ground
and
the
time
of
the
next
succeeding
conference
of
the
church
preparations
for
the
laying
of
the
were
carried
on
with
determination
and
vigor
the
glad
event
occurred
on
the
of
april
the
anniversary
of
the
organization
of
the
church
and
was
celebrated
by
the
people
with
such
evidences
of
thanksgiving
and
genuine
joy
as
assured
their
devotion
to
the
work
so
auspiciously
begun
civic
and
military
bodies
took
part
there
were
processions
with
bands
of
music
and
solemn
services
with
prayer
the
mayor
of
the
city
was
marshal
of
the
day
the
city
police
served
as
a
guard
of
honor
and
the
territorial
militia
marched
with
the
congregation
of
the
saints
the
placing
of
the
was
celebrated
as
an
accomplished
triumph
though
but
a
beginning
let
it
not
be
imagined
that
the
work
was
carried
through
without
hindrance
or
the
foundation
was
commenced
at
the
corner
june
and
was
completed
july
a
course
of
rubble
was
laid
on
the
actual
foundation
and
this
was
succeeded
by
courses
of
flagstone
the
work
had
gone
forward
but
slowly
when
in
a
serious
interruption
occurred
at
that
time
the
people
prepared
to
abandon
their
homes
temporarily
at
least
and
seek
an
abiding
place
elsewhere
in
the
desert
the
cause
of
the
portending
exodus
was
the
approach
of
an
armed
force
sent
by
the
united
states
government
to
subdue
an
alleged
rebellion
in
utah
this
military
movement
had
been
ordered
through
an
utter
misunderstanding
of
facts
based
on
vicious
misrepresentation
the
coming
of
the
soldiery
had
been
heralded
with
dire
threats
of
violence
and
while
the
people
knew
themselves
innocent
of
any
act
of
disloyalty
toward
the
government
or
its
officers
they
had
not
forgotten
the
harrowing
scenes
of
organized
persecution
in
missouri
and
illinois
due
to
misapprehension
and
they
preferred
the
uncertainties
of
the
desert
to
the
dread
alternative
of
a
possible
repetition
of
the
past
in
the
saddening
preparations
for
departure
the
people
carefully
covered
the
foundation
work
on
the
site
of
the
temple
excavations
were
and
every
vestige
of
masonry
was
obscured
at
that
time
no
part
of
the
foundation
had
been
carried
above
when
the
process
was
complete
the
site
showed
nothing
more
attractive
than
a
remote
resemblance
to
the
barren
stretch
of
a
roughly
plowed
field
it
is
pleasing
to
note
that
a
peaceable
adjustment
between
the
army
and
the
people
was
effected
the
saints
returned
to
their
homes
and
the
soldiers
established
a
camp
afterward
to
become
a
post
at
a
distance
of
forty
miles
from
the
city
the
interruption
in
building
operations
thus
occasioned
was
followed
by
a
short
period
of
comparative
inactivity
after
the
return
of
the
people
the
foundations
were
uncovered
but
before
the
resumption
of
it
was
found
that
the
rubble
overlying
the
foundation
proper
and
immediately
under
the
flagstone
layers
seemed
to
have
less
stability
than
was
required
and
straightway
both
flagging
and
rubble
were
removed
stone
of
best
quality
was
substituted
and
the
work
of
actual
construction
was
continued
with
renewed
energy
the
reconstruction
was
a
work
of
years
the
temple
enclosure
was
for
a
brief
period
the
communal
center
of
mechanical
industry
the
one
great
of
the
intermountain
commonwealth
the
church
had
established
there
its
public
works
comprising
a
power
plant
in
which
the
energy
of
city
creek
was
harnessed
to
the
wheel
equipment
iron
foundry
and
machine
shops
for
the
working
of
both
wood
and
metal
much
of
the
work
here
done
had
no
connection
with
the
extensive
building
operations
on
temple
block
beside
the
interruptions
and
delays
already
noted
other
hindrances
were
inevitable
and
under
the
best
of
conditions
progress
could
be
but
slow
not
until
years
after
the
move
incident
to
the
entrance
of
the
federal
soldiery
had
the
material
of
the
main
structure
been
decided
upon
as
far
back
as
the
october
conference
of
the
question
of
material
had
been
considered
oolite
from
the
quarries
in
sanpete
county
red
sandstone
from
the
hills
adobes
with
intermixed
pebbles
each
had
been
suggested
and
the
matter
was
brought
to
vote
though
it
must
be
admitted
the
question
presented
was
somewhat
indefinite
in
form
at
the
forenoon
session
of
the
conference
on
october
president
heber
kimball
submitted
the
question
shall
we
have
the
temple
built
of
stone
from
red
butte
adobes
rock
or
the
best
stone
the
mountains
afford
in
reply
a
resolution
was
adopted
by
unanimous
vote
to
the
effect
that
we
build
a
temple
of
the
best
materials
that
can
be
obtained
in
the
mountains
of
north
america
and
that
the
presidency
dictate
where
the
stone
and
other
materials
shall
be
obtained
the
action
is
significant
as
showing
the
faith
reliance
and
determination
of
the
people
the
temple
they
were
about
to
rear
should
be
in
every
particular
the
best
the
people
could
produce
this
modern
house
of
the
lord
was
to
be
no
temporary
structure
nor
of
small
proportions
nor
of
poor
material
nor
of
mean
or
inadequate
design
it
was
known
at
the
outset
that
the
building
could
not
be
finished
for
many
a
long
year
for
decades
perhaps
and
by
that
time
this
colony
would
have
become
a
commonwealth
the
few
would
have
grown
to
a
multitude
of
souls
the
temple
was
to
be
worthy
of
the
great
future
sandstone
oolite
adobe
blocks
each
and
all
were
considered
and
in
turn
rejected
the
decision
was
to
this
effect
the
walls
should
be
of
solid
granite
an
enormous
deposit
of
this
durable
stone
had
been
discovered
in
the
cottonwood
canyons
twenty
miles
to
the
and
to
those
people
it
was
enough
to
know
that
suitable
material
was
available
at
whatever
cost
of
toil
and
sacrifice
at
whatever
toll
of
and
suffering
it
should
be
procured
the
temple
granite
is
in
reality
a
syenite
and
occurs
as
an
immense
laccolith
in
the
cottonwood
section
of
the
wasatch
the
erosion
of
long
ages
had
cut
deep
canyons
through
the
eruptive
mass
and
glaciers
descending
with
irresistible
force
had
dislodged
and
transported
countless
boulders
many
of
them
of
colossal
size
these
isolated
blocks
known
as
erratics
furnished
the
supply
of
building
stone
it
was
not
found
necessary
to
quarry
into
the
granite
in
place
in
the
canyon
the
boulders
were
divided
mostly
by
the
use
of
and
wedges
though
low
power
explosives
were
used
to
a
small
extent
the
rough
blocks
were
conveyed
at
first
by
four
yoke
were
required
for
each
block
and
every
trip
was
a
labored
journey
of
three
or
four
days
a
canal
for
the
conveyance
of
the
rock
by
water
was
projected
and
indeed
work
thereon
was
begun
but
the
plan
was
abandoned
as
the
prospect
of
railroad
transportation
became
more
certain
the
plan
of
the
building
was
given
by
brigham
young
president
of
the
church
and
the
structural
details
were
worked
out
under
his

is
vertical
the
second
large

forms
a
cope
for
those

terminate
with
a
projected
cope
the
only
difference
between
the
tower
buttresses
and
the
one
just
described
is
instead

the
roof
is
quite
flat
rising
only
eight
feet
and
is
to
be
covered
with
galvanized
iron
or
some
other
metal
the
building
is
to
be
otherwise
ornamented
in
many
places
the
whole
structure
is
designed
to
symbolize
some
of
the
great
architectural
work
above
the
basement
windows
recede
in
from
the

on
columns
which
extend
from
an
enriched
string
course
at
the
foot
of
each
window
to
the
center
of
major
axis
my
chief
object
in
the
last
paragraph
is
to
show
to
the
judgment
of
any
who
may
be
baffled
how
those
windows
can
be
come
at
etc
all
the
windows
in
the
towers
are
moulded
and
have
stone
jambs
each
being
crowned
with
label
mouldings
for
further
particulars
wait
till
the
house
is
done
then
come
and
see
it
the
whole
house
covers
an
area
of
thousand
eight
hundred
and
fifty
feet
the
entrance
of
the
union
pacific
railway
into
utah
in
served
temporarily
to
retard
work
on
the
temple
as
the
call
for
laborers
on
the
great
line
was
deemed
imperative
eventually
however
the
activity
in
railroad
construction
operated
as
a
great
assistance
in
the
undertaking
for
to
the
main
line
branches
succeeded
and
by
a
side
line
had
reached
the
granite
quarries
from
the
city
station
a
track
was
constructed
up
south
temple
street
and
into
temple
block
the
work
of
construction
proceeded
so
slowly
as
to
arouse
a
feeling
akin
to
impatience
in
the
hearts
of
saints
and
mild
restraint
was
called
for
at
other
times
gentle
urging
was
necessary
the
work
was
apportioned
to
the
people
of
the
territory
which
for
convenience
was
divided
into
temple
districts
stakes
and
wards
and
quorums
of
the
priesthood
were
assigned
their
parts
and
an
effective
system
of
divided
labor
and
responsibility
was
developed
president
brigham
young
died
in
at
which
time
the
granite
walls
of
the
temple
had
reached
a
height
of
about
twenty
feet
above
ground
during
the
administration
of
his
successor
president
john
taylor
the
work
was
continued
without
important
interruption
for
another
decade
and
thereafter
was
urged
with
even
greater
vigor
under
the
direction
of
wilford
woodruff
the
next
president
of
the
church
as
the
concluding
laps
of
a
race
are
generally
marked
by
increased
energy
incident
to
the
final
spurt
the
supreme
effort
to
reach
the
end
in
glory
and
triumph
as
in
a
powerful
drama
interest
becomes
more
intense
and
action
more
concentrated
with
the
approach
of
the
finale
so
in
this
great
undertaking
the
fact
that
the
end
was
looming
above
the
horizon
of
sight
called
forth
redoubled
energies
on
the
part
of
the
people
when
the
granite
had
risen
to
the
square
and
when
the
spires
began
to
appear
in
place
a
feeling
of
almost
feverish
anxiety
was
manifest
throughout
the
church
laying
of
the
capstone
the
sixth
day
of
april
was
determined
upon
as
the
date
for
placing
in
position
the
capstone
of
the
temple
and
the
announcement
was
hailed
with
joy
in
every
ward
and
branch
of
the
church
and
in
every
household
of
the
saints
the
day
marked
the
close
of
the
annual
conference
and
was
hallowed
by
all
the
observances
of
solemn
assembly
as
a
preliminary
to
the
principal
ceremony
a
vast
congregation
had
assembled
in
the
tabernacle
at
an
early
hour
and
in
this
the
several
organizations
of
the
priesthood
occupied
distinctive
places
on
the
main
floor
while
the
galleries
were
reserved
for
the
accommodation
of
the
general
public
at
the
close
of
an
impressive
service
the
multitude
proceeded
in
formal
procession
to
the
open
space
on
the
south
side
of
the
temple
where
a
temporary
platform
had
been
erected
with
the
flag
of
the
nation
waving
above
an
adjoining
stand
accommodated
the
choir
which
numbered
over
two
hundred
singers
there
was
band
music
of
the
highest
order
and
every
essential
element
of
fervent
worship
combined
with
joyous
celebration
had
been
provided
over
forty
thousand
people
were
gathered
within
the
confines
of
temple
block
and
other
thousands
unable
to
find
a
place
in
the
great
square
stood
in
the
streets
or
looked
down
from
roofs
and
windows
of
adjoining
buildings
it
is
of
record
unchallenged
that
this
assembly
was
the
largest
ever
known
in
utah
at
high
noon
the
special
service
was
begun
the
music
of
both
band
and
choir
the
marches
and
anthems
and
hymns
had
been
specially
composed
for
the
joyous
occasion
the
prayer
was
offered
by
president
joseph
smith
of
the
first
presidency
and
the
great
amen
was
echoed
by
two
score
thousand
throats
a
hymn
followed
and
then
the
venerable
president
of
the
church
wilford
woodruff
stepped
to
the
front
and
announced
that
the
auspicious
moment
so
long
awaited
had
arrived
these
were
his
ringing
words
attention
all
ye
house
of
israel
and
all
ye
nations
of
the
earth
we
will
now
lay
the
of
the
temple
of
our
god
the
foundation
of
which
was
laid
and
dedicated
by
the
prophet
seer
and
revelator
brigham
young
at
this
juncture
the
president
closed
an
electric
circuit
on
the
stand
and
the
granite
hemisphere
forming
the
highest
block
of
the
great
temple
slowly
descended
into
position
then
followed
a
scene
the
like
of
which
is
never
enacted
by
this
people
except
on
occasions
of
extraordinary
solemnity
namely
the
rendering
of
the
sacred
hosanna
shout
led
by
lorenzo
snow
president
of
the
council
of
the
twelve
apostles
the
forty
thousand
saints
shouted
as
with
the
voice
of
one
hosanna
hosanna
hosanna
to
god
and
the
lamb
amen
amen
amen
this
was
repeated
thrice
each
shout
accompanied
by
the
waving
of
white
kerchiefs
from
the
roof
of
the
building
came
the
voice
of
the
j
don
carlos
young
declaring
that
the
capstone
was
duly
laid
and
choir
and
congregation
broke
forth
in
triumphant
song
the
spirit
of
god
like
a
fire
is
burning
the
glory
begins
to
come
forth
the
visions
and
blessings
of
old
are
returning
and
angels
are

elder
francis
lyman
of
the
council
of
the
twelve
then
proposed
the
adoption
of
the
resolution
presented
below
believing
that
the
instruction
of
president
woodruff
respecting
the
early
completion
of
the
salt
lake
temple
is
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
us
i
propose
that
this
assemblage
pledge
themselves
collectively
and
individually
to
furnish
as
fast
as
it
may
be
needed
all
the
money
that
may
be
required
to
complete
the
temple
at
the
earliest
time
possible
so
that
the
dedication
may
take
place
on
april
the
adoption
was
manifested
by
a
deafening
shout
from
the
assembled
multitude
accompanied
by
the
raising
of
hands
the
final
anthem
was
the
glorious
song
of
the
redeemed
particularly
appropriate
to
the
hour
and
the
benediction
was
pronounced
by
president
george
cannon
the
topstone
and
the
granite
block
upon
which
it
immediately
rests
form
a
sphere
within
the
lower
half
a
cavity
had
been
prepared
and
in
this
were
placed
certain
books
and
other
articles
so
that
as
the
capstone
was
laid
it
formed
a
secure
and
massive
lid
to
this
stone

completion
of
the
building
and
its
dedication
the
adoption
of
a
plan
or
the
formal
passing
of
a
resolution
by
vote
is
an
easy
matter
compared
with
which
the
working
out
of
that
plan
the
achieving
of
what
was
provided
for
by
the
vote
may
be
a
gigantic
task
such
was
the
contrast
between
the
action
of
the
assembled
multitude
on
the
of
april
and
the
work
accomplished
in
the
year
that
followed
when
the
capstone
of
the
temple
was
laid
the
scene
inside
the
walls
was
that
of
chaos
and
confusion
to
finish
the
interior
within
a
year
appeared
a
practical
impossibility
the
task
the
people
had
taken
upon
themselves
was
almost
superhuman
nevertheless
they
considered
the
instruction
to
complete
the
building
within
the
specified
time
to
be
verily
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
them
and
they
remembered
the
utterance
of
the
ancient
prophet
i
know
that
the
lord
giveth
no
commandments
unto
the
children
of
men
save
he
shall
prepare
a
way
for
them
that
they
may
accomplish
the
thing
which
he
commandeth
them
the
saints
regarded
their
act
of
voting
to
be
equivalent
to
the
affixing
of
their
individual
signatures
to
a
note
of
promise
as
to
how
well
they
met
their
obligation
and
kept
their
promise
let
the
achievement
of
the
year
speak
the
people
had
pledged
themselves
collectively
and
individually
to
furnish
as
fast
as
it
may
be
needed
all
the
money
that
may
be
required
to
complete
the
temple
at
as
early
a
time
as
possible
so
that
the
dedication
may
take
place
on
april
the
pledge
was
met
in
full
under
date
of
april
the
first
presidency
issued
a
general
epistle
addressed
to
the
saints
in
zion
and
throughout
the
world
directing
that
the
people
gather
in
their
places
of
worship
on
sunday
the
first
day
of
may
and
devote
the
day
to
solemn
fasting
and
prayer
to
this
call
the
people
responded
faithfully
mingled
with
their
thanksgiving
for
the
manifold
blessings
of
the
past
were
fervent
supplications
for
success
in
the
work
of
completing
the
lord
house
within
the
time
prescribed
in
the
work
of
finishing
the
temple
it
was
that
there
be
a
competent
responsible
man
in
charge
who
should
be
invested
with
executive
authority
in
every
department
of
the
labor
while
the
first
presidency
and
the
council
of
the
twelve
retained
in
their
hands
the
directing
power
they
needed
an
agent
who
could
be
trusted
to
act
with
promptness
decision
and
authority
on
every
question
that
should
arise
the
choice
of
the
presiding
authorities
for
a
man
to
fill
this
responsible
position
fell
upon
john
winder
who
was
at
that
time
second
counselor
in
the
presiding
bishopric
and
who
afterward
became
first
counselor
in
the
first
presidency
of
the
church
at
the
time
of
his
appointment
to
the
responsible
position
of
general
superintendent
of
temple
work
april
president
winder
was
in
his
year
yet
he
possessed
the
energy
and
activity
of
youth
combined
with
the
wisdom
and
discretion
that
age
alone
can
give
under
his
efficient
supervision
work
on
the
interior
of
the
temple
progressed
at
a
rate
that
surprised
even
the
workers
laborers
of
all
classes
mechanics
masons
plasterers
carpenters
glaziers
plumbers
painters
decorators
artisans
and
artificers
of
every
kind
were
put
to
work
the
people
verily
believed
that
a
power
above
that
of
man
was
operating
to
assist
them
in
their
great
undertaking
material
much
of
which
was
of
special
manufacture
came
in
from
the
east
and
the
west
with
few
of
the
usual
delays
of
transit
heating
and
lighting
systems
were
installed
and
this
installation
necessitated
the
erection
of
a
boiler
house
with
all
accessories
of
equipment
moreover
the
annex
had
to
be
built
at
this
point
it
may
be
well
to
explain
that
each
of
the
temples
in
utah
is
connected
with
a
separate
structure
known
as
the
annex
in
the
nature
of
an
in
which
preliminary
services
are
held
and
wherein
record
is
made
of
the
ordinance
work
to
be
done
by
the
parties
present
before
they
are
permitted
to
enter
the
temple
on
the
day
of
service
the
annex
to
the
temple
in
salt
lake
city
stands
about
one
hundred
feet
north
from
the
main
structure
even
as
late
as
one
month
prior
to
the
date
set
for
the
dedication
there
was
so
much
yet
to
be
done
as
to
make
many
feel
that
for
once
at
least
the
people
had
been
mistaken
in
their
belief
that
the
lord
had
spoken
and
that
the
completion
of
the
work
by
the
time
set
was
a
physical
impossibility
on
the
of
march
the
first
presidency
issued
the
following
epistle
the
officers
and
members
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
the
near
approach
of
the
date
for
the
dedication
of
the
temple
of
our
god
moves
us
to
express
with
some
degree
of
fulness
our
feelings
to
our
brethren
the
officers
of
the
church
who
with
us
bear
the
priesthood
of
the
son
of
god
and
to
the
saints
generally
to
the
end
that
in
entering
that
holy
building
we
may
all
be
found
acceptable
ourselves
with
our
households
and
that
the
building
which
we
shall
dedicate
may
also
be
acceptable
unto
the
lord
the
saints
have
used
their
means
freely
to
erect
other
temples
in
these
valleys
and
our
father
has
blessed
us
in
our
efforts
today
we
enjoy
the
great
happiness
of
having
three
of
these
sacred
structures
completed
dedicated
to
and
accepted
of
the
lord
wherein
the
saints
can
enter
and
attend
to
those
ordinances
which
he
in
his
infinite
goodness
and
kindness
has
revealed
but
for
forty
years
the
hopes
desires
and
anticipations
of
the
entire
church
have
been
centered
upon
the
completion
of
this
edifice
in
the
principal
city
of
zion
its
foundation
was
laid
in
the
early
days
of
our
settlement
in
these
mountains
and
from
that
day
until
the
present
the
eyes
of
the
members
of
the
church
in
every
land
have
been
lovingly
directed
toward
it
looking
upon
it
as
the
temple
of
temples
the
people
during
all
these
years
have
labored
with
unceasing
toil
undiminished
patience
and
ungrudging
expenditure
of
means
to
bring
it
to
its
present
condition
of
completion
and
now
that
the
toils
and
the
sacrifices
of
forty
years
are
crowned
so
successfully
and
happily
now
that
the
great
building
is
at
last
finished
and
ready
to
be
used
for
divine
purposes
need
we
say
that
we
draw
near
an
event
whose
consummation
is
to
us
as
a
people
momentous
in
the
highest
degree
in
its
consequence
as
that
occasion
is
certain
to
be
what
remains
for
us
to
say
in
order
to
impress
the
entire
church
with
a
sense
of
its
tremendous
importance
on
this
point
surely
nothing
yet
may
we
offer
a
few
words
upon
a
phase
that
directly
touches
it
no
member
of
the
church
who
would
be
deemed
worthy
to
enter
that
sacred
house
can
be
considered
ignorant
of
the
principles
of
the
gospel
it
is
not
too
much
to
presume
that
every
one
knows
what
his
duty
is
to
god
and
to
his
fellowman
none
is
so
forgetful
as
to
have
lost
sight
of
the
admonition
that
we
must
be
filled
with
love
for
and
charity
toward
our
brethren
and
hence
none
can
for
a
moment
doubt
the
supreme
importance
of
every
member
of
the
congregation
being
at
peace
with
all
his
or
her
brethren
and
sisters
and
at
peace
with
god
how
else
can
we
hope
to
gain
the
blessings
he
has
promised
save
by
complying
with
the
requirements
for
which
those
blessings
are
the
reward
can
men
and
women
who
are
violating
a
law
of
god
or
those
who
are
derelict
in
yielding
obedience
to
his
commands
expect
that
the
mere
going
into
his
holy
house
and
taking
part
in
its
dedication
will
render
them
worthy
to
receive
and
cause
them
to
receive
his
blessing
do
they
think
that
repentance
and
turning
away
from
sin
may
be
so
lightly
dispensed
with
do
they
dare
even
in
thought
thus
to
accuse
our
father
of
injustice
and
partiality
and
attribute
to
him
carelessness
in
the
fulfilment
of
his
own
words
assuredly
no
one
claiming
to
belong
to
his
people
would
be
guilty
of
such
a
thing
then
must
those
who
are
unworthy
cease
to
expect
a
blessing
from
their
attendance
at
the
temple
while
sin
unrepented
of
still
casts
its
odor
about
them
and
while
bitterness
or
even
an
unforgiving
coolness
exists
in
their
hearts
against
their
brethren
and
sisters
on
this
latter
subject
we
feel
that
much
might
be
said
in
the
striving
after
compliance
with
the
apparently
weightier
matters
of
the
law
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
importance
of
this
spirit
of
love
and
kindness
and
charity
may
be
underestimated
for
ourselves
we
can
not
think
of
any
precept
that
at
present
requires
more
earnest
inculcation
during
the
past
eighteen
months
there
has
been
a
division
of
the
saints
upon
national
party
lines
political
campaigns
have
been
conducted
elections
have
been
held
and
feelings
more
or
less
intense
have
been
engendered
in
the
minds
of
brethren
and
sisters
upon
one
side
and
the
other
we
have
been
cognizant
of
conduct
and
have
heard
of
many
expressions
that
have
been
very
painful
to
us
and
have
grieved
our
spirits
we
know
they
have
been
an
offense
unto
the
god
of
peace
and
love
and
a
stumbling
block
unto
many
of
the
saints
we
feel
now
that
a
time
for
reconciliation
has
come
that
before
entering
into
the
temple
to
present
ourselves
before
the
lord
in
solemn
assembly
we
shall
divest
ourselves
of
every
harsh
and
unkind
feeling
against
each
other
that
not
only
our
bickerings
shall
cease
but
that
the
cause
of
them
shall
be
removed
and
every
sentiment
that
prompted
and
has
maintained
them
shall
be
dispelled
that
we
shall
confess
our
sins
one
to
another
and
ask
forgiveness
one
of
another
that
we
shall
plead
with
the
lord
for
the
spirit
of
repentance
and
having
obtained
it
follow
its
promptings
so
that
in
humbling
ourselves
before
him
and
seeking
forgiveness
from
each
other
we
shall
yield
that
charity
and
generosity
to
those
who
crave
our
forgiveness
that
we
ask
for
and
expect
from
heaven
thus
may
we
come
up
into
the
holy
place
with
our
hearts
free
from
guile
and
our
souls
prepared
for
the
edification
that
is
promised
thus
shall
our
supplications
undisturbed
by
a
thought
of
discord
unitedly
mount
into
the
ears
of
jehovah
and
draw
down
the
choice
blessings
of
the
god
of
heaven
as
your
brethren
sustained
by
your
vote
and
in
your
faith
as
the
first
presidency
of
the
church
we
have
this
to
say
to
the
saints
in
our
individual
as
well
as
our
official
capacity
if
there
is
a
single
member
of
the
church
who
has
feelings
against
us
we
do
not
wish
to
cross
the
threshold
of
the
temple
until
we
have
satisfied
him
and
have
removed
from
him
all
cause
of
feeling
either
by
explanation
or
by
making
proper
amends
and
atonement
neither
would
we
wish
to
enter
the
sacred
portals
of
that
edifice
until
we
have
sought
an
explanation
or
amends
or
atonement
from
any
against
whom
we
may
have
either
a
real
or
fancied
grievance
in
now
announcing
this
course
for
ourselves
we
say
to
all
the
other
officers
of
the
church
that
we
desire
them
to
follow
our
example
we
wish
them
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
and
throughout
all
the
stakes
and
wards
of
zion
to
take
heed
of
this
counsel
let
them
invite
all
who
may
have
feelings
against
them
to
come
forward
and
make
them
known
let
them
then
endeavor
to
correct
any
misapprehensions
or
misunderstandings
which
may
exist
or
give
redress
for
any
wrong
or
injury
that
may
have
been
done
we
say
the
same
and
when
the
officers
have
taken
the
course
indicated
we
wish
them
to
say
the
same
to
the
individual
members
of
the
church
we
call
upon
them
to
seek
to
have
the
fellowship
of
their
brethren
and
their
sisters
and
their
entire
confidence
and
love
above
all
to
seek
to
have
the
fellowship
and
union
of
the
holy
ghost
let
this
spirit
be
sought
and
cherished
as
diligently
within
the
smallest
and
humblest
family
circle
as
within
the
membership
of
the
highest
organization
and
quorum
let
it
permeate
the
hearts
of
the
brothers
and
sisters
the
parents
and
children
of
the
household
as
well
as
the
hearts
of
the
first
presidency
and
twelve
let
it
mellow
and
soften
all
differences
between
members
of
the
stake
presidencies
and
the
high
councils
as
well
as
between
neighbors
living
in
the
same
ward
let
it
unite
young
and
old
male
and
female
flock
and
shepherd
people
and
priesthood
in
the
bounds
of
gratitude
and
forgiveness
and
love
so
that
israel
may
feel
approved
of
the
lord
and
that
we
may
all
come
before
him
with
a
conscience
void
of
offense
before
all
men
then
there
will
be
no
disappointment
as
to
the
blessings
promised
those
who
sincerely
worship
him
the
sweet
whisperings
of
the
holy
spirit
will
be
given
to
them
and
the
treasures
of
heaven
the
communion
of
angels
will
be
added
from
time
to
time
for
his
promise
has
gone
forth
and
it
can
not
fail
asking
god
blessing
upon
you
all
in
your
endeavor
to
carry
out
this
counsel
and
desirous
of
seeing
it
take
the
form
of
a
united
effort
on
the
part
of
the
whole
people
we
suggest
that
saturday
march
be
set
apart
as
a
day
of
fasting
and
prayer
on
that
occasion
we
advise
that
the
presidencies
of
stakes
the
high
councils
the
bishops
and
their
counselors
meet
together
with
the
saints
in
their
several
meeting
houses
confess
their
sins
one
to
another
and
draw
out
from
the
people
all
feelings
of
anger
of
distrust
or
of
unfriendliness
that
may
have
found
a
lodgment
so
that
entire
confidence
may
then
and
there
be
restored
and
love
from
this
time
prevail
through
all
the
congregations
of
the
saints
it
was
evident
that
the
authorities
of
the
church
realized
the
importance
of
preparing
for
the
great
event
of
the
dedication
in
other
ways
than
by
material
construction
and
costly
furnishings
the
hearts
of
the
people
had
to
be
made
ready
it
was
necessary
that
israel
be
sanctified
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
zion
there
was
a
general
cleansing
of
mind
and
soul
enmity
was
buried
bickering
ceased
differences
between
brethren
were
adjusted
offenses
were
atoned
and
forgiven
a
veritable
jubilee
was
celebrated
the
finishing
touches
to
the
interior
of
the
building
were
made
late
in
the
afternoon
of
april
and
in
the
evening
of
that
day
the
temple
was
thrown
open
to
general
inspection
not
only
were
members
of
the
church
admitted
many
honorable
men
and
women
who
had
never
affiliated
with
the
church
were
invited
to
the
number
of
over
one
thousand
and
they
passed
through
the
temple
from
basement
to
top
in
view
of
the
current
belief
that
the
temples
of
the
saints
are
never
open
to
the
gaze
of
this
fact
is
of
significant
importance
on
the
morning
of
the
of
april
wilford
woodruff
president
of
the
church
led
the
way
through
the
door
into
the
sacred
precincts
the
event
has
been
not
inaptly
likened
to
that
of
joshua
leading
israel
into
the
promised
land
the
venerable
president
was
followed
by
the
rest
of
the
general
authorities
of
the
church
and
these
in
turn
by
other
church
officials
and
such
members
as
had
been
specially
designated
to
take
part
in
the
first
dedication
service
of
the
tens
of
thousands
of
saints
who
desired
to
be
present
whose
rightful
privilege
it
was
to
attend
and
who
had
contributed
of
their
substance
to
the
building
of
the
greatest
temple
of
modern
times
but
few
could
be
accommodated
on
the
day
of
dedication
the
assembly
room
which
with
its
vestries
occupies
the
entire
upper
floor
had
been
furnished
with
seating
accommodations
for
two
thousand
two
hundred
and
persons
it
was
arranged
therefore
that
services
be
repeated
twice
daily
to
continue
from
april
until
all
who
were
entitled
to
admission
had
had
opportunity
to
be
present
on
the
first
day
the
following
were
admitted
to
take
part
in
what
will
always
be
remembered
as
the
official
dedicatory
session
the
first
presidency
the
council
of
the
twelve
apostles
the
presiding
patriarch
the
first
council
of
the
seventy
the
presiding
bishopric
and
all
other
general
authorities
of
the

and
in
addition
presidents
of

and
their
counselors
members
of
stake
high
councils
patriarchs
presidents
of
high
priests
quorums
and
their

of

bishops
of

and
their
counselors
admission
was
extended
to
the
wives
and
immediate
families
of
all
the
church
officials
named
to
the
later
sessions
admission
was
regulated
so
that
particular
wards
and
stakes
had
each
a
special
assignment
as
to
time
no
one
was
admitted
without
a
formal
certificate
conventionally
known
as
a
recommend
signed
by
the
bishop
of
his
ward
and
the
president
of
his
stake
in
a
circular
of
instruction
relating
to
the
dedication
the
following
appears
it
will
be
necessary
for
each
applicant
to
show
his
or
her
recommend
to
the
in
order
to
pass
the
recommend
will
then
be
taken
up
by
a
inside
the
gate
no
person
will
be
admitted
without
a
recommend
on
any
occasion
services
were
held
daily
from
april
to
april
inclusive
and
again
on
the
and
usually
two
sessions
were
held
each
day
but
on
the
of
april
an
evening
session
was
added
while
children
under
eight
years
of
age
and
therefore
unbaptized
were
not
admitted
to
the
general
sessions
special
days
were
set
apart
for
their
accommodation
thus
april
and
friday
and
saturday
were
reserved
for
sunday
school
children
under
the
prescribed
age
for
baptism
at
the
first
service
the
official
dedication
the
prayer
was
offered
by
president
wilford
woodruff
and
at
each
succeeding
session
the
prayer
was
read
the
prayer
itself
is
at
once
a
sermon
and
a
supplication
it
is
expressive
of
the
inmost
thoughts
of
the
people
it
is
an
epitome
of
the
history
of
the
saints
and
the
condition
of
the
church
at
that
time
the
prayer
follows
in
full
our
father
in
heaven
thou
who
hast
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
all
things
that
are
therein

love
and
truth

this
day
before
thee
and

this
house
which
we
have
built
to
thy
most
holy
name
humbly
plead
the
atoning
blood
of
thine
only
begotten
son
that
our
sins
may
be
remembered
no
more
against
us
forever
but
that
our
prayers
may
ascend
unto
thee
and
have
free
access
to
thy
throne
that
we
may
be
heard
in
thy
holy
habitation
and
may
it
graciously
please
thee
to
hearken
unto
our
petitions

them
according
to
thine
infinite
wisdom
and
love
and
grant
that
the
blessings
which
we
seek
may
be
bestowed
upon
us
even
a
hundred

power
of
the
aaronic
and
melchisedek
priesthood
which
thou
didst
bestow
upon
him
by
the
administration
of
holy
angels

held
that
priesthood

the
days
of
the
savior

raise
up
thy

on
the
earth
for
many
years
and
who
led
thy
people
to
these
valleys
of
the
mountains
and
laid
the
of
this
great
temple
and
dedicated
it
unto
thee
and
who
did
direct
the
building
of
three
other
temples
in
these
rocky
mountains
which
have
been
dedicated
unto
thy
holy
name
in
which
temples
many
thousands
of
the
living
have
been
blessed
and
the
dead
redeemed
our
father
in
heaven
we
are
also
thankful
to
thee
for
thy
servant
john
taylor
who
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
thy
servant

he
laid
down
his
life
in
exile

present
day

power
could
have
preserved
him
through
that
which
he
has
passed
during
the
years

hast
granted
him
life
on
the
earth
for
the

children
have

thee
in
erecting
in
these
mountains
in
past
ages
thou
didst
inspire
with
thy
holy
spirit
thy
servants
the
prophets
to
speak
of
a
time
in
the
latter
days
when
the

exalted
above
the

and
that
thou
hast
condescended
to
permit
us
to
take
part
in
the
great
work
and
as
this
portion
of
thy
servants
words
has
thus
so
marvelously
been
brought
to
pass
we
pray
thee
with
increased
faith
and
renewed
hope
that
all
their
words
with
regard
to
thy
great
work
in
gathering
thine
israel
and
building
up
thy
kingdom
on
earth
in
the
last
days
may
be
as
amply
fulfilled

and
thanksgiving

hearts
filled
with

hast
permitted
us
to

this
day

forty

thy
most
glorious
name

set
the

today
we
dedicate
the

and
of
worship

of
thy
son
our
savior

stand
before
thy
face
may
be

hallowed
messengers

to
us
thy
wishes

come
forth
in

first
resurrection
that
we
who
dwell
on

may
be
bound
to
those
who

in
heaven
we
thank
thee
for
their
sake
who
have
finished
their
work
in
mortality
as
well
as
for
our
own
that
the
prison
doors
have
been
opened
that
deliverance
has
been
proclaimed
to
the
captive
and
the
bonds
have
been
loosened
from
those
who
were
bound
we
praise
thee
that
our

from

from
now
back

in
indissoluble
links
welded

these
sacred
walls
and
make
known
unto
us
with
regard
to
the
work
we
should
perform
in
behalf
of
our
dead
and
as
thou
hast
inclined
the
hearts
of
many
who
have
not
yet
entered
into
covenant
with
thee
to
search
out
their
progenitors
and
in
so
doing
they
have
traced
the
ancestry
of
many
of
thy
saints
we
pray
thee
that
thou
wilt
increase
this
desire
in

accomplishment

work

them
we
pray
thee
in
their
labors
that
they
may
not
fall
into
errors
in
preparing
their
genealogies
and
furthermore
we
ask
thee
to
open
before
them
new
avenues
of
information
and
place
in
their
hands
the
records
of
the
past
that
their
work
may
not
only
be
correct

complete

israel
no

that
which
thou
hast
done

been
marvelous
in

we
thank
thee
that
thou
didst
move
upon
the
heart
of
the
president
of
our
nation
to
issue
a
general
amnesty
that
thou
hast
removed
prejudice
and
misunderstanding
from
the
minds
of
many
of

and
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
and
likewise
all
the
poor
the
afflicted
and
the
oppressed
and
indeed
all
people
that
their
hearts
may
be
softened
when
thy
servants
go
forth
to
bear
testimony
of
thy
name
that
their
prejudices
may
give

despotic
form

overthrown

thou
hast
created
for

the
eternal
father
thou
knowest
all
things
thou
seest
the
course
thy
people
have
been
led
to
take
in
political
matters
they
have
in
many
instances
joined
the
two
great
national
parties
campaigns
have
been
entered
upon
elections
have
been
held
and
much
party
feeling
has
been
engendered
many
things
have
been
said
and
done
which
have
wounded
the
feelings
of
the
humble
and
the
meek
and
which
have
been
a
cause
of
offense
we
beseech
thee
in
thine
infinite
mercy
and
goodness
to
forgive
thy
people
wherein
they
have
sinned
in
this
direction
show
them
o
father
their
faults
and
their
errors
that
they
may

in
the

of
the

and
repent
truly
and
sincerely
and
cultivate
that
spirit
of
affection
and
love
which
thou
art
desirous
that
all
the
children
of
men
should
entertain
one
for

and
which
thy
saints
above
all
others
should
cherish
enable
thy
people
hereafter
to
avoid
bitterness
and
strife
and
to
refrain
from
words
and
acts
in
political
discussions
that
shall
create
feeling
and
grieve
thy
holy
spirit
heavenly
father
when
thy
people
shall
not
have
the
opportunity
of
entering
this
holy
house
to
offer
their
supplications
unto
thee
and
they
are
oppressed
and
in
trouble
surrounded
by
difficulties

assailed
by

and
shall
turn
their
faces
towards
this
thy
holy
house
and
ask
thee
for
deliverance
for
help
for
thy
power
to
be
extended

we
beseech
thee
to
look
down
from

tender
compassion
upon

their
cries
or
when
the
children
of
thy

in

shall
be
separated
through
any

from
this
place

their
hearts
shall
turn
in

of
thy

and
grant
unto

the
blessings
for
which
they
ask
almighty
father
increase
within
us
the
powers
of
that
faith
delivered
to
and
possessed
by
thy
saints
strengthen
us
by
the
memories
of
the
glorious
deliverances
of
the
past
by
the
remembrance
of
the
sacred
covenants
that
thou
hast
made
with
us
so
that
when
evil
overshadows
us
when
trouble
encompasses
us
when
we
pass
through
the
valley
of
humiliation
we
may
not
falter
may
not
doubt
but
in
the
strength
of
thy
holy
name
may
accomplish
all
thy
righteous
purposes
with

thy

where
thou
sittest
enthroned
in

with
an
infinitude

which
we
thy

amen
and
amen
all
who
attended
the
dedicatory
services
on
the
morning
of
the
of
april
remember
the
impressiveness
of
the
day
the
sky
was
overcast
and
lowering
and
shortly
before
the
hour
of
beginning
a
strong
wind
set
in
from
the
this
wind
increased
to
a
veritable
hurricane
and
throughout
the
morning
session
it
seemed
indeed
that
the
prince
of
the
air
was
in
full
control
but
the
peace
and
serenity
of
the
assembly
was
rendered
the
more
impressive
by
contrast
with
the
turmoil
and
storm
without
a
large
had
been
set
up
in
the
assembly
room
and
served
as
an
accompaniment
to
the
choir
of
selected
voices
by
whom
the
anthems
and
hymns
specially
composed
for
the
occasion
were
rendered
the
essential
and
characteristic
feature
of
the
service
was
of
course
the
offering
of
the
dedicatory
prayer
and
to
this
were
added
brief
addresses
by
officials
of
the
church
at
the
first
session
each
of
the
first
presidency
delivered
an
address
replete
with
promise
and

the

temple
at
salt
lake
city
exterior
before
us
stands
the
completed
structure
the
visible
result
of
four
decades
of
devoted
toil
a
period
marked
in
the
beginning
by
poverty
and
penury
followed
by
relative
prosperity
and
plenty
the
impression
produced
by
a
first
view
of
the
exterior
is
that
of
massiveness
coupled
with
a
sense
of
assured
stability
closer
examination
and
more
intimate
acquaintance
serve
to
intensify
this
early
impression
while
revealing
numerous
details
of
uniqueness
in
plan
and
of
excellence
in
construction
as
to
architectural
design
the
temple
belongs
to
a
class
of
its
own
originality
rather
than
novelty
characterizes
every
prominent
feature
and
yet
there
is
nothing
apparent
that
speaks
of
strained
effect
nor
of
conscious
effort
for
departure
from
more
conventional
lines
the
temple
is
no
oddity
in
architecture
on
the
contrary
it
is
strictly
in
place
both
as
to
material
environment
and
spiritual
atmosphere
the
building
is
of
composite
style
presenting
features
of
both
the
gothic
and
the
roman
by
architects
of
experience
it
has
been
described
as
a
modification
of
the
round
gothic
while
others
have
called
it
romanesque
in
that
it
follows
in
part
the
castellated
style
so
highly
developed
in
england
but
even
if
this
description
be
true
as
to
the
exterior
it
is
wholly
inapplicable
within
there
are
no
gothic
ceilings
nor
massive
beams
after
the
style
romanesque
on
the
contrary
the
interior
partakes
rather
of
the
nature
of
renaissance
design
the
temple
was
constructed
for
specific
use
it
was
intended
for
service
widely
different
from
that
of
cathedral
tabernacle
mosque
or
synagogue
and
the
building
was
planned
and
patterned
to
suit
its
distinctive
purpose
such
was
and
is
the
reason
for
its
being
the
explanation
of
its
design
both
vindication
and
justification
of
its
plan
as
has
been
shown
the
plans
of
the
building
were
made
known
and
a
fairly
detailed
description
thereof
was
published
in
a
careful
examination
of
the
structure
as
it
now
appears
shows
that
in
every
essential
particular
the
original
plan
of
the
exterior
has
been
followed
almost
to
exactness
details
of
spires
turrets
and
finials
had
not
been
determined
when
the
design
was
first
announced
and
in
these
as
in
certain
other
particulars
the
original
plan
has
been
added
to
but
no
essential
alteration
has
been
introduced
as
it
stands
the
building
is
one
hundred
feet
six
inches
long
and
one
hundred
eighteen
feet
six
inches
wide
including
extensions
of
the
corner

tower
has
a
height
of
two
hundred
and
four
feet
and
the
corresponding
tower
at
the
east
rises
six
feet
higher
the
entire
area
covered
by
the
building
is
thousand
eight
hundred
and
fifty
square
feet
the
walls
are
set
upon
a
massive
footing
which
extends
sixteen
feet
below
ground
is
sixteen
feet
wide
at
the
base
and
narrows
to
nine
feet
at
the
top
from
the
to
the
globes
surmounting
the

the
walls
are
of
granite
every

accurately
cut
as
to

and
fitted
with
equal
nicety
outside
and
inside
the
windows
both
arched
and
oval
all
deeply
set
in
their
granite
recesses
are
framed
with
oolite
throughout
the
first
story
the
walls
are
eight
feet
thick
in
the
upper
structure
the
thickness
is
reduced
by
stages
to
a
minimum
of
six
feet
the
buttresses
are
uniformly
one
foot
thicker
than
the
walls
proper
the
building
consists
of
three
towers
at
each
end
east
and
west
and
between
these
extends
the
main
body
suggesting
to
the
observer
at
a
distance
a
vast
intermediate
nave
in
the
temple
is
strikingly
symmetrical
each
of
the
central
axes
being
an
axis
of
symmetry
the
westerly
half
is
a
repetition
of
the
easterly
and
the
southerly
half
duplicates
the
northerly
lines
running
north
and
south
through
the
centre
of
the
three
towers
at
either
end
are
also
lines
of

indicated
without
by
a

arched
windows
between

course
immediately
above
these
oval
openings
marks
the
centre
of
construction
as
seen
in
the
vertical
section
of
the
main
body
the
upper
half
up
to
the
level
of
the
top
is
in
general
a
repetition
of
the
lower
the
roof
has
so
little
pitch
as
to
be
practically
flat
there
being
a
rise
of
but
eight
feet
from
edge
to
centre
between
the
end
towers
that
is
to
say
in
the
main
body
of
the
building
the
walls
carry
nine
buttresses
or
pilasters
on
both
north
and
south
sides
each
of
these
pilasters
rises
above
the
parapets
and
battlement
walls
and
is
capped
by
a
granite
block
three
and
a
half
feet
square
at
its
base
and
two
and
a
half
feet
high
of
these
pilaster
caps
four
on
either

are
open
and
constitute
the
tops
of

which
extend
to
the
basement
above
the

level
rise
the
upper
sections
of
the
towers
with
their
spires
and
finials
octagonal
turrets
occupy
the
corners
of
the
towers
and
each
turret
is
surmounted
by
a
pyramidal
monolith
six
feet
high
and
three
feet
in
diameter
at
the
base
the
apex
of
this
pyramid
is
cut
to
represent
an
acanthus
cluster
each
of
the
six
towers
is
surmounted
by
a
pyramidal
spire
which
terminates
in
a
spherical
capstone
the
cut
blocks
forming
the
spires
are
two
feet
in
thickness
the
capstones
of
the
four
corner
towers
are
three
feet
in
diameter
while
those
of
the
two
center
towers
measure
eight
inches
more
the
spherical
termination
of
the
east
center
tower
which
is
the
highest
stone
in
the
building
and
therefore
the
capstone
proper
supports
a
statue
the
crown
of
which
marks
the
point
of
greatest
altitude
in
the
entire
structure
the
figure
which
stands
twelve
and
a
half
feet
high
is
that
of
a
man
in
the
character
of
a
herald
or
messenger
blowing
a
trumpet
in
pose
and
proportion
the
figure
is
graceful
and
gentle
yet
virile
and
strong
the
drapings
are
simple
and
leave
only
feet
arms
neck
and
head
bare
around
the
head
is
a
slender
circlet
supporting

of
hammered
copper
thickly
overlaid
with
it
is
the
work
of
dallin
and
now
of
more
than
national
fame
as
a
sculptor
the
figure
is
intended
to
represent
moroni
the
nephite
prophet
who
died
about
and
who
as
a
resurrected
being
came
in
to
the
joseph
smith
and
delivered
to
him
the
message
of
the
restored
gospel
in
accordance
with
the
prediction
of
the
ancient
seer
and
i
saw
another
angel
fly
in
the
midst
of
heaven
having
the
everlasting
gospel
to
preach
unto
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth

questions
as
to
the
style
of
architecture
embodied
in
the
great
temple
have
been
asked
time
and
time
again
some
prominent
architects
have
classed
it
as
round
gothic
others
have
said
that
it
is
practically
unclassifiable
it
being
material
and
not
at
all
design
in
my
judgment
it
might
be
called
the
romanesque

the

it

it

could
achieve
in

its

strictly
in

presented

there
evidence
of
hurried
plan
or
careless
execution
even
the
attic
rooms
and
muniments
but
seldom
used
are
well
and
fully
furnished
however
the
temple
is
not
beautified
throughout
with
equal
elaboration
there
has
been
no
lavish
nor
unnecessary
expenditure
in
embellishment
the
predominating
intent
has
been
that
of
appropriateness
there
are
many
rooms
of
plain
design
furnished
in

simple
style
there
are
others
in

no

has
been
spared

sublimity
in

nowhere

marvelous
as
was
the
achievement
of
the
people
in
rearing
the
great
temple
and
particularly
so
in
the
commencement
of
the
work
under
conditions
that
appeared
so
generally
unfavorable
the
undertaking
becomes
even
more
remarkable
when
we
take
into
consideration
other
carried
on
while
the
temple
was
in
course
of
erection
not
only
were
three
other
temples
begun
and
completed
during
this
period
but
were
reared
all
in
the
various
wards
and
stakes
and
other
structures
of
yet
greater
capacity
were
erected
for
assemblies
of
the
church
in
general
the
buildings
constructed
on
temple
block
in
salt
lake
city
represent
in
and
of
themselves
great
undertakings
when
considered
in
the
light
of
circumstances
prevailing
at
the
time
among
such
buildings
are
the
existing
tabernacle
the
structure
long
since
removed
and
now
referred
to
as
the
old
tabernacle
and
the
assembly
hall
it
is
interesting
to
know
that
the
first
shelters
erected
for
public
gatherings
within
what
is
now
salt
lake
city
were
boweries
among
these
the
old
bowery
is
distinctively
named
and
known
on
the
of
july
but
one
week
after
the
arrival
of
the
pioneers
in
the
valley
of
the
great
salt
lake
a
detachment
of
the
mormon
battalion
which
had
just
reached
the
settlement
or
as
it
was
even
then
called
the
city
built
for
the
accommodation
of
worshipping
assemblies
a
bowery
of
poles
and
brush
this
in
time
was
superseded
by
a
yet
larger
structure
of
the
kind
one
hundred
feet
by
sixty
feet
which
came
to
be
known
in
local
history
as
the
old
bowery
it
consisted
of
posts
set
up
at
convenient
intervals
around
the
sides
of
a
quadrangle
the
tops
of
the
posts
being
joined
by
poles
held
in
place
by
wooden
pegs
or
lashed
in
position
by
rawhide
thongs
and
upon
this
willows
evergreens
sagebrush
and
other
shrubs
were
piled
resulting
in
a
covering
which
was
a
partial
protection
from
the
sun
though
but
a
poor
barrier
against
wind
and
rain
old
at
first
this
building
was
known
as
the
tabernacle
since
the
erection
of
the
present
building
bearing
that
name
the
earlier
structure
has
come
to
be
known
as
the
old
tabernacle
it
was
one
hundred
and
feet
in
length
by
feet
in
width
and
occupied
the
site
of
the
present
assembly
hall
in
the
corner
of
temple
block
for
its
day
and
time
it
was
a
large
and
pretentious
building
as
to
its
seating
capacity
we
read
that
at
the
time
of
its
dedication
during
the
april
conference
of
there
were
hundred
persons
present
at
one
session
its
ceiling
was
arched
and
was
supported
without
pillars
many
of
the
posts
and
poles
of
the
old
bowery
entered
into
the
construction
of
the
old
tabernacle
the
building
now
so
known
was
distinctively
designated
the
new
tabernacle
at
the
time
of
its
construction
it
was
begun
in
july
and
was
so
far
advanced
as
to
permit
the
holding
of
the
general
conference
beneath
its
roof
in
october
this
remarkable
structure
was
planned
and
erected
under
the
direction
of
president
brigham
young
for
it
no
claim
of
architectural
beauty
is
asserted
the
general
appearance
is
that
of
a
huge
inverted
bowl
resting
on
pillars
it
is
in
truth
a
vast
elliptical
dome
supported
at
the
edge
by
massive
sandstone
walls
and
buttresses
the
buttresses
measure
nine
feet
in
width
or
depth
and
three
feet
in
thickness
the
space
between
the
buttresses
is
occupied
by
doors
windows
and
walls
the
doors
open
outward
thus
affording
ready
means
of
exit
the
building
measures
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
length
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
width
at
the
center
the
ceiling
is
seventy
feet
from
the
floor
in
the
middle
and
from
the
ceiling
to
roof
the
distance
is
ten
feet
a
capacious
gallery
thirty
feet
wide
extends
along
the
inner
walls
and
is
broken
at
the
west
end
only
where
it
gives
place
to
the
grand
organ
and
the
seats
reserved
for
the
great
choir
in
contrast
with
the
usual
methods
of
construction
this
enormous
gallery
is
not
continuous
with
the
walls
at
intervals
of
twelve
to
fifteen
feet
great
beams
connect
the
gallery
with
the
wall
buttresses
but
between
these
beams
the
gallery
is
set
forward
two
and
feet
from
the
inside
of
the
walls
and
the
open
spaces
are
guarded
by
a
high
railing
it
is
believed
that
the
surprising
acoustic
properties
of
the
building
are
due
in
part
to
this
feature
of
construction
the
great
dome
is
in
fact
a
colossal
whispering
gallery
as
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
visitors
who
have
inspected
the
building
know
when
it
is
emptied
save
for
the
few
the
fall
of
a
pin
dropped
at
the
focal
point
of
the
ellipse
near
one
end
of
the
building
may
be
heard
at
the
corresponding
point
near
the
other
end
the
convenient
seating
capacity
of
the
building
including
that
of
the
gallery
is
nearly
nine
thousand
though
under
conditions
of
crowding
congregations
much
larger
than
this
have
assembled
at
the
west
end
are
the
stands
including
the
pulpits
there
are
really
three
pulpits
rising
in
tiers
or
terraces
these
afford
accommodations
for
the
church
officers
of
different
grades
in
authority
on
either
side
of
the
are
extended
platforms
for
other
bodies
of
priesthood
behind
the
stands
and
pulpits
rising
on
either
side
to
the
level
of
the
gallery
and
occupying
the
space
in
front
of
the
great
organ
is
the
choir
space
seated
to
accommodate
approximately
three
hundred
singers
with
extra
provision
in
the
gallery
for
nearly
as
many
more
at
the
west
end
of
the
building
is
the
great
organ
generally
admitted
to
be
one
of
the
best
instruments
of
its
class
ever
built
at
the
time
of
its
construction
it
was
the
largest
organ
in
this
country
and
the
second
or
third
largest
in
the
world
one
of
the
many
surprising
features
connected
with
the
instrument
lies
in
the
fact
of
its
having
been
constructed
by
local
artisans
the
woodwork
including
pipe
and
mechanical
equipment
is
wholly
of
native
material
the
organ
occupies
a
of
by
thirty
feet
and
rises
to
a
height
of
forty
feet
for
the
body
of
the
organ
itself
while
the
towers
in
front
reach
a
height
of
feet
its
stops
and
regulators
number
one
hundred
and
ten
it
contains
over
three
thousand
six
hundred
pipes
which
range
from
half
an
inch
to
feet
in
speaking
length
there
are
four
complete
finger
and
one
pedal
system
making
in
all
five
individual
organs
in
size
and
proportions
the
organ
comports
with
the
great
building
in
which
it
is
installed
while
in
tonal
quality
and
mechanical
equipment
it
is
of
an
order
of
excellence
corresponding
to
the
other
appointments
of
this
splendid
auditorium
the
domed
roof
is
constructed
on
the
principle
of
support
and
is
throughout
its
entire
extent
there
being
no
pillars
between
ceiling
and
floor
the
is
of
wood
and
at
the
time
of
its
construction
the
beams
and
trusses
were
held
together
by
wooden
pegs
and
rewhide
thongs
these
materials
were
used
instead
of
nails
from
necessity
rather
than
from
choice
nails
were
obtainable
only
as
new
supplies
were
brought
in
by
prairie
wagons
and
the
cost
of
the
long
haul
precluded
their
use
while
at
present
there
are
many
larger
in
the
great
buildings
of
the
country
most
of
the
more
recent
structures
are
of
steel
and
it
is
doubtful
if
ever
there
has
been
made
a
more
stable
structure

its
kind

wholly
of
wood

the
great
temple
at
salt
lake
city
has
been
the
first
to
be
considered
specifically
and
in
detail
in
these
pages
this
course
has
been
followed
because
of
the
fact
that
among
modern
temples
the
one
at
salt
lake
city
is
the
largest
the
costliest
and
by
far
the
most
generally
known
and
moreover
as
already
stated
of
the
four
temples
thus
far
erected
in
utah
this
was
the
first
begun
and
the
last
finished
while
it
was
in
course
of
construction
three
other
temples
were
proposed
planned
built
dedicated
and
opened
to
sacred
ordinance
service
these
are
known
from
their
locations
as
the
george
temple
the
logan
temple
and
the
manti
temple
the
sequence
in
which
they
are
named
is
the
order
in
which
they
were
completed
and
opened
it
will
be
convenient
to
follow
this
order
in
further
considering
them
each
of
the
three
is
constructed
on
the
same
general
plan
and
for
similar
specific
purposes
while
they
are
of
varying
richness
and
each
is

essentially
the

no
detailed
description
of
internal
arrangements
or
furnishings
will
be
attempted
as
such
would
be
little
more
than
a
reiteration
in
part
of
what
has
been
said
the
george
temple
the
city
of
george
the
county
seat
of
washington
county

in
a
direct
line
and
three
hundred

brigham
young
addressed
the
people
from
the
report
of
his
remarks
the
following
excerpts
are
taken
as
they
furnish
an
illustration
of
the
earnestness
with
which
the
commission
to
build
temples
was
regarded
and
of
the
practical
nature
of
what
the
people
considered
to
be
their
duties
as
members
of
the
church
the
president
urged
a
concentration
of
effort
on
the
part
of
the
people
in
the
work
and
continued
the
idea
may
arise
that
this
is
a
hard
land
in
which
to
get
a
living
now
i
am
very
thankful
for
the
land
just
as
it
is
i
am
glad
that
it
is
just
as
it
is
it
is
a
splendid
country
to
rear
saints
in
among
our
other
duties
we
have
to
build
a
temple
here
i
advise
that
the
bishop
of
this
city
the
bishop
of
santa
clara
and
the
bishop
of
washington
apportion
labor
among
the
members
of
their
respective
wards
to
excavate
the
ground
for
the
foundation
of
the
temple
and
to
haul
rock
sand
clay
and
other
material
if
the
brethren
undertake
to
do
this
work
with
one
heart
and
mind
we
shall
be
blessed
exceedingly
and
prospered
of
the
lord
in
our
earthly
substance
now
if
the
people
present
are
one
with
the
first
presidency
in
this
work
and
will
unite
with
them
to
prosecute
the
labor
of
building
this
temple
by
faith
prayers
and
good
works

all
brethren
and
sisters
manifest
it
by

hand
the

will
be
built
of
stone

and
inside
there
will
be
a

and
on
the
extreme
corners
of
the

and
a
basement
the
two
main
rooms
or

over
the
other
will
each
be
feet

established
agreeable
to
the
laws
of
our

and
commandments
of

on
the
sixth
of

patriarch
of
the
whole
church
suffered
martyrdom
in
carthage
illinois
june
and
the
church
was
driven
into
the
wilderness
in
then
followed
the
names
of
all
the
general
authorities
of
the
church
as
at
that
time
constituted
to
the
specifications
given
in
the
foregoing
it
is
necessary
to
add
only
the
following
to
make
the
description
fairly
complete
the
tower
is
feet
square
the
vane
on
the
tower
is
one
hundred
and
feet
from
the
ground
the
foundation
of
the
entire
basement
story
consists
of
a
black
basaltic
lava
a
rock
occurring
abundantly
in
the
region
and
well
adapted
to
the
purpose
the
soil
of
the
place
is
sandy
and
heavily
impregnated
with
alkaline
mineral
salts
and
no
rock
that
readily
undergoes
disintegration
either
through
abrasion
or
as
the
result
of
a
solution
of
cementing
material
is
suitable
for
foundation
work
in
this
soil
the
foundation
of
the
building
extends
below
the
ten
feet
about
of
the
east
end
and
a
portion
of
the
northerly
side
rest
on
in
place
throughout
the
rest
of
its
extent
the
foundation
is
laid
on
a
thick
layer
of
broken
volcanic
rock
firmly
compacted
under
the
blows
of
a
pile
driver
a
capacious
drain
encircles
the
building
and
connects
with
a
yet
larger
drain
fifty
feet
easterly
from
the
square
tower
the
foundation
is
twelve
feet
wide
at
the
bottom
and
the
walls
are
gradually
diminished
in
width
so
that
at
the
level
of
the
basement
window
sills
they
have
a
thickness
of
three
feet
eight
inches
above
the
basement
story
the
building
is
constructed
of
the
fine
red
sandstone
of
the
region
from
quarries
specifically
located
and
opened
for
this
work
timber
and
lumber
had
to
be
hauled
by
team
from
distances
of
from
seventy
to
ninety
miles
the
temple
stands
in
the
open
plain
on
but
a
slight
elevation
practically
devoid
of
all
the
prominence
that
belongs
to
a
commanding
position
of
altitude
the
ground
on
which
the
building
rests
as
well
as
the
region
for
miles
round
about
is
of
a
prevailing
color
and
this
too
is
the
color
of
the
sandstone
of
which
the
temple
is
built
naturally
the
building
as
a
whole
would
blend
with
its
surroundings
so
as
to
be
practically
invisible
from
even
a
moderate
distance
a
contrast
has
been
afforded
by
whitening
the
walls
and
as
a
result
the
structure
has
become
a
striking
feature
of
the
landscape
as
to
the
interior
it
may
be
sufficient
to
say
that
all
the
ordinance
work
connected
with
baptism
ordination
endowment
and
sealing
as
performed
in
the
temple
at
salt
lake
city
is
administered
in
a
similar
manner
in
this
temple
and
provision
therefor
is
made
for
all
the
sacred
ordinances
there
is
ample
equipment
of
rooms
and
furnishings
the
basement
floor
is
divided
into
fourteen
rooms
of
which
the
baptistry
or
by
forty
feet
is
one
of
the
largest
and
most
important
as
is
usual
the
baptistry
is
situated
below
the
general
level
of
the
assembly
rooms
also
as
in
the
other
temples
the
baptismal
font
rests
upon
twelve
oxen
of
cast
iron
which
occupy
a
depression
slightly
below
the
floor
the
font
oxen
iron
stairs
and
all
accessories
weighing
in
all
over
eighteen
thousand
pounds
were
cast
in
salt
lake
city
and
were
hauled
by
team
thence
to
george
the
entire
baptistry
equipment
was
the
personal
gift
of
president
brigham
young
above
the
basement
there
are
two
stories
in
each
of
these
there
is
one
main
room

an
arched
or
elliptical
ceiling

are
a
number
of
smaller
rooms
used
for
ordinance
work
and
as
assembly
rooms
for
councils
of
the
priesthood
the
large
room
on
the
middle
floor
corresponds
in
use
to
the
splendid
celestial
room
already
described
as
a
prominent
feature
of
the
temple
at
salt
lake
city
in
the
same
way
the
large
room
on
the
upper
floor
corresponds
to
the
main
assembly
room
on
the
fourth
floor
of
the
salt
lake
city
temple
and
is
provided
with
pulpits
at
both
east
and
west
ends
the
former
devoted
to
the
use
of
the
higher
or
melchisedek
priesthood
the
latter
reserved
for
the
officials
of
the
lesser
or
aaronic
order
of
priesthood
adjoining
the
main
building
is
an
accessory
structure
known
as

were
as

we
have
dedicated
this
spot
of
ground
upon

we
expect
to
erect
a
temple
in
which
to
administer
the
ordinances
of
the
house
of
god

this
house
when

wages
are
entirely
out

we
shall
expect
the
brethren
and
sisters
neighborhood
after
neighborhood
ward
after
ward
to
turn
out
their
proportion
of
men
to
come
here
and
labor
as
they
shall
be
notified
by
the
proper
authorities
this
may
be
called
a
temporal
work
but
it
pertains
to
the
salvation
of
ourselves
as
well
as
our
friends
who
have
passed
behind
the
veil
and
also
the
generations
who
are
to
come
after
us
we
can
carry
this
temple
forward
with
our
labor
without
any
burden
to
ourselves
if
our
hearts
are
in
the
work
and
we
will
be
blessed
abundantly
in
doing
so
we
will
be
better
off
in
our
temporal
affairs
when
it
is
completed
than
when
we
commenced
and
than
we
would
be
if
we
did
not
build
it
the
time
we
enjoy
is
the
lord
but
we
have
permission
to
direct
its
use
according
to
our
good
pleasure
when
the
brethren
come
to
work
on
this
temple
they
may
expect
to
be
blessed
of
the
lord
according
to
their
faith
we
pray
for
you
continually
that
you
may
be
blessed

bless
you
according
to
the
power
and
keys
of
the
holy
priesthood
bestowed
upon
me
and
my
brethren

me
heart
and
hand
and
all
the
saints
feel
to
say
feel
to
bless
each
other
feel
to
do
the
work
of
the
lord
and
dismiss
the
narrow
contracted
covetous
feelings
that
are
so
interwoven
with
the
feelings
of
our
natures
it
seems
hard
to
get
rid
of
them
but
we
must
overcome
them
and
unite
ourselves
together
in
the
holy
order
of
god
that
we
may
be
saints
of
the
most
high

at
the

with
an
octagonal
tower
at
each

one
hundred
feet
high
and
a
large
square
tower
at
each
end
the
tower
at
the
west
end
is
one
hundred
and
feet
and
that
at
the

one
hundred
and
seventy
feet
high
in
this
feature
of
the
east
tower
being
higher
than
that
at
the
west
the
logan
temple
resembles
the
greater
structure
at
salt
lake
city
massive
buttresses
strengthen
the
walls
and
the
masonry
is
of
the
best
as
to
architecture
the
temple
may
be
described
as
belonging
to
the
castellated
style
the
rock
used
in
the
building
was
brought
from
the
mountain
quarries
near
by
and
is
a
very
hard
compact
silicious
limestone
locally
called
fucoid
rock
from
its
content
of
fossilized
marine
plants
known
as
fucoids
a
more
typical
limestone
was
used
for
the
arches
and
for
the
uprights
and
lintels
of
doors
and
windows
this
material
being
susceptible
of
a
better
dressed
surface
than
was
possible
with
the
silicious
rock
watertables
and
the
caps
of
battlements
and
towers
consist
of
a
light
buff
sandstone
brought
from
quarries
near
franklin
idaho
as
the
rock
used
in
the
walls
is
of
diversified
color
the
entire
exterior
has
been
painted
in
buff
the
lumber
used
in
the
building
was
obtained
from
logan
canyon
and
was
prepared
at
the
temple
which
had
been
specially
installed
for
the
purpose
an
interesting
sidelight
is
thrown
on
the
spirit
of
earnestness
with
which
the
people
went
about
this
work
of
temple
building
by
the
fact
that
even
the
was
ceremonially
dedicated
when
first
put
in
commission
all
the
lumber
used
was
selected
and
as
nearly
as
possible
was
chosen
so
as
to
be
free
from
defect
the
principal
varieties
are
red
pine
for
the
heavier
work
and
white
pine
for
such
interior
construction
as
stands
and
altars
the
framework
of
the
roof
is
of
the
best
red
pine
and
is
of
ingenious
construction
spanning
a
distance
of
feet
without
at
first
the
roof
was
covered
with
but
this
proved
unsatisfactory
because
of
leakage
due
to
fractures
resulting
from
variations
in
temperature
and
the
old
but
efficient
style
of
shingle
roof
was
finally
substituted
the
workmanship
throughout
is
high
class
indeed
it
is
said
that
after
nearly
thirty
years
not
a
door
has
been
known
to
sag
or
a
wall
to
crack
the
total
cost
of
the
temple
when
completed
was
approximately
seven
hundred
thousand
dollars
the
building
has
five
full
stories
the
basement
story
is
occupied
by
the
font
room
and
adjoining
dressing
rooms
in
common
with
the
practise
followed
in
saint
temples
generally
the
font
is
supported
on
twelve
oxen
of
which
stand
in
a
well
beneath
the
general

of
the

rise
at
intervals
of
a

what
is
known
as
the

which
corresponds
to
the
celestial

elsewhere
described
as
in
other

this
is
the
most
splendidly
finished
of
all
the
large

according
to
the
nature
of
the

at
any

provides
for
the
comfortable

there
are
no

above
the
assembly
room
on
the
fourth

already
described
the
logan
temple
was
seven
years
in
building
on
may
the
structure
was
dedicated
to
the
service
of
the
lord
and
immediately
thereafter
was
opened
for
sacred
ordinances
the
dedicatory
services
lasted
three
days
that
is
to
say
services
were
held
on
each
of
two
days
following
the
official
dedication
and
on
these
later
days
the
dedicatory
prayer
was
read
to
the
assembly
the
ceremonies
and
services
attending
the
dedication
were
held
in
the
large
assembly
room
on
the
fourth
floor
and
the
seating
capacity
of
the
great
auditorium
was
taxed
to
the
utmost
at
every
meeting
president
brigham
young
had
died
before
the
laying
of
the
and
the
building
of
the
temple
had
been
prosecuted
at
first
under
the
administration
of
the
council
of
the
twelve
which
on
the
dissolution
of
the
first
presidency
becomes
the
presiding
council
of
the
church
and
later
under
the
direction
of
the
new
first
presidency
on
the
day
of
the
dedication
the
prayer
was
offered
by
president
john

after
which
his
counselors

made
addresses
and
they
were
followed

after
which
the
stirring
hosanna
shout
was
rendered
benediction
was
pronounced
by
john

the
presiding
patriarch
the
manti
temple
before
construction
work
had
been
begun
on
the
logan
temple
preparations
were
in
progress
for
the
erection
of
another
house
of
the
lord
manti
the
chief
city
of
sanpete
county
situated
about
one
hundred
and
four
miles
southerly
from
salt
lake
city
in
a
direct
line
and
one
hundred
and
thirty
miles
by
rail
was
selected
as
the
place
of
this
new
sanctuary
in
a
circular
issued
by
the
first
presidency
and
the
council
of
the
twelve
october
the
boundaries
of
the
manti
temple
district
were
specified
as
the
following
shows
we
feel
led
to
say
to
the
saints
throughout
these
mountains
let
us
arise
and
build
temples
unto
our
god
at
such
places
as
he
shall
designate
into
which
we
and
our
children
can
enter
and
receive
those
blessings
that
he
has
in
store
for
us
let
the
bishops
of
the
settlements
in
washington
kane
iron
piute
beaver
millard
sevier
sanpete
and
juab
counties
call
the
people
of
their
wards
together
and
ascertain
from
them
how
much
each
one
is
willing
to
do
in
labor
and
means
monthly
quarterly
and
annually
toward
the
erection
of
a
temple
at
manti
sanpete
county
let
it
not
be
forgotten
that
at
this
time
the
people
were
putting
forth
strong
efforts
to
complete
the
temple
at
george
and
were
taking
preliminary
steps
toward
the
erection
of
that
at
logan
and
throughout
this
period
the
greatest
temple
of
all
was
in
course
of
construction
at
salt
lake
city
yet
notwithstanding
the
weight
of
these
duties
which
many
would
call
tasks
if
not
burdens
the
call
of
authority
was
heard
directing
another
great
undertaking
of
the
kind
as
to
the
location
of
the
precise
site
on
which
the
manti
temple
should
stand
a
decision
had
been
reached
in
a
council
of
the
authorities
held
at
ephraim
june
and
the
spot
known
as
the
manti
stone
quarry
had
been
reserved
for
the
purpose
the
spot
so
designated
is
the
termination
or
point
of
a
hill
which
in
turn
appears
as
the
spur
of
a
low
range
of
hills
marked
by
the
outcrop
of
a
well
stratified
and
evenly
bedded
deposit
of
oolite
this
is
a
granular
rock
the
separate
particles
of
which
are
minute
spheroids
consisting
of
concentric
layers
of
calcium
carbonate
the
stone
appears
under
a
lens
not
unlike
hence
the
name
oolite
literally
meaning
the
selection
of
this
spot
on
which
to
found
the
temple
meant
that
the
structure
would
literally
be
built
upon
the
rock
upon
rock
in
place
upon
an
unbroken
and
undisturbed
terrane
the
temple
was
to
consist
of
stone
found
at
the
spot
cut
and
shaped
for
beauty
and
service
the
material
is
admirably
adapted
for
the
purpose
readily
quarried
easily
tooled
and
withal
attractive
both
in
texture
and
color
the
manti
oolite
is
of
uniform
grain
and
of
a
fine
cream
color
it
has
been
used
extensively
for
the
erection
of
some
of
the
more
pretentious
residences
in
salt
lake
city
and
moreover
is
the
material
of
the
annex
to
the
salt
lake
temple
and
of
the
and
other
trimmings
of
the
great
granite
structure
the
site
at
manti
was
dedicated
april
in
the
presence
of
many
of
the
general
authorities
of
the
church
and
hundreds
of
other
people
president
young
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
temple
lot
broke
ground
and
dedicated
the
site
by
solemn
service
he
himself
offering
the
prayer
he
then
gave
brief
instructions
as
to
further
procedure
emphasizing
the
fact
that
the
temple
was
to
be
built
by
the
labor
of
the
people
and
as
a
offering
and
that
work
thereon
was
not
to
be
made
a
means
of
profit
his
address
so
clearly
illustrative
of
the
peculiar
regard
with
which
the
saints
invest
the
great
commission
they
hold
to
build
temples
unto
the
lord
follows
we
now
call
upon
the
people
through
the
several
bishops
who
preside
in
this
and
the
neighboring
settlements
for
men
to
come
here
with
teams
and
wagons
plows
and
scrapers
picks
and
shovels
to
prepare
this
ground
for
the
mason
work
let
this
work
be
commenced
forthwith
and
as
soon
as
possible
we
shall
expect
from
to
men
every
working
day
throughout
the
season
to
labor
here
we
intend
building
this
temple
for
ourselves
and
we
are
abundantly
able
to
do
it
therefore
no
man
need
come
here
to
work
expecting
wages
for
his
services
the
neighboring
settlements
will
send
their
men
and
they
can
be
changed
whenever
and
as
often
as
desirable
and
they
can
get
credit
on
labor
tithing
or
on
donation
account
for
their
services
and
we
expect
them
to
work
until
this
temple
is
completed
without
asking
for
wages
it
is
not
in
keeping
with
the
character
of
saints
to
make
the
building
of
temples
a
matter
of
merchandise
we
want
to
rear
this
temple
with
clean
hands
and
pure
hearts
that
we
with
our
children
may
enter
into
it
to
receive
our
washings
and
anointings
the
keys
and
ordinances
of
the
holy
priesthood
and
also
to
officiate
in
the
same
for
our
fathers
and
mothers
and
our
forefathers
who
lived
and
died
without
the
gospel
that
they
with
us
may
be
made
partakers
of
the
fruits
of
the
tree
of
life
and
live
and
rejoice
in
our
father
kingdom
the
gospel
is
free
its
ordinances
are
free
and
we
are
at
liberty
to
rear
this
temple
to
the
name
of
the
lord
without
charging
anybody
for
our
services
we
call
upon
the
sisters
also
to
render
what
assistance
they
can
in
this
matter
they
can
do
a
great
deal
by
way
of
encouraging
their
husbands
and
sons
and
also
by
making
clothing
of
various
kinds
for
them
and
in
otherwise
providing
for
them
while
they
are
working
here
now
bishops
if
any
person
should
inquire
what
wages
is
to
be
paid
for
work
done
on
this
temple
let
the
answer
be
one
dime
and
when
the
temple
is
completed
we
will
work
in
god
holy
house
without
inquiring
what
we
are
going
to
get
or
who
is
going
to
pay
us
but
we
will
trust
in
the
lord
for
our
reward
and
he
will
not
forget
us
the
fowls
of
the
air
says
the
savior
for
they
sow
not
neither
do
they
reap
nor
gather
into
barns
yet
your
heavenly
father
feedeth
them
are
ye
not
much
better
than
they
let
this
work
be
commenced
without
delay
building
can
not
be
performed
here
in
the
winter
as
in
george
the
rearing
of
this
temple
will
have
to
be
done
in
the
milder
portions
of
the
season
when
the
air
is
free
from
frost
god
bless
you
brethren
and
sisters
we
hope
and
pray
that
you
will
be
inspired
to
perform
this
work
with
honor
to
yourselves
and
glory
to
god
this
is
the
work
of
the
latter
days
that

entered
upon

of
preparing
for
the

million

dedicatory
services
were
set
for
may
from
accounts
published
at
the
time
it
is
plain
that
the
interest
in
the
great
event
was
intense
thus
we
read
from
an
early
hour
on
the
of
may
people
began
to
assemble
on
the
hill
east
of
the
temple
at
which
admission
was
to
be
gained
and
by
the
grounds
were
black
with
people
the
day
was
lovely
the
threatened
rain
of
the
night
preceding
having
passed
away
as
for
two
days
before
all
the
roads
leading
to
manti
were
clouded
with
incoming
teams
each
loaded
with
living
freight
bound
for
the
dedication
president
john
taylor
who
as
the
presiding
officer
of
the
council
of
the
twelve
apostles
had
directed
the
laying
of
the
and
who
afterward
became
the
president
of
the
church
had
died
in
july
again
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
was
without
an
organized
first
presidency
of
three
and
at
the
time
of
the
dedication
of
the
manti
temple
the
council
of
the
twelve
was
the
presiding
quorum
of
the
church
wilford
woodruff
was
at
this
time
the
president
of
the
council
of
the
twelve
the
services
began
at
by
which
time
the
great
room
was
filled
to
its
utmost
capacity
the
principal
feature
of
course
was
the
dedicatory
prayer
which
was
offered
by
elder
lorenzo
snow
of
the
council
of
the
twelve
addresses
were
delivered
by
the
presiding
patriarch
of
the
church
by
several
of
the
council
of
the
twelve
apostles
and
by
other
prominent
brethren
in
the
priesthood
on
account
of
the
large
numbers
desiring
to
attend
services
were
repeated
on
the
two
days
following
may
and
on
each
of
these
occasions
the
dedicatory
prayer
was
read
hymns
and
anthems
were
rendered
and
addresses
given
by
speakers
chosen
by
the
presiding
authorities
on
the
first
day
the
actual
services
occupied
five
hours
and
over
seventeen
hundred
people
attended
many
of
the
saints
testified
to
remarkable
manifestations
of
divine
power
which
they
witnessed
on
this
grand
and
solemn
occasion
on
the
first
day
just
as
professor
smyth
was
concluding
the
voluntary
a
selection
from
mendelssohn
a
number
of
the
saints
in
the
body
of
the
hall
and
some
of
the
brethren
in
the
west
stand
heard
most
heavenly
voices
singing
it
sounded
to
them
as
angelic
and
appeared
to
be
behind
and
above
them
and
many
turned
their
heads
in
that
direction
wondering
if
there
was
not
another
choir
in
some
other
part
of
the
building
there
was
no
other
choir
however
some
of
the
saints
saw
the
spirit
of
presidents
young
and
taylor
grant
and
others
in
the
temple
and
the
heads
of
some
of
the
speakers
were
surrounded
by
a
halo
of
heavenly
light
during
the
services
the
saints
enjoyed
a
spiritual
feast
extending
through
the
three
days
and
many
shed
tears
of
joy
while
listening
to
the
testimonies
and
admonitions
of
the
servants
of
god
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
god
has
accepted
the
manti
temple
at
the
hands
of
his
saints
and
will
bless
all
who
have
in
any
degree
assisted
to
build
it
or
who
not
having
the
means
to
assist
have
said
in
their
hearts
would
have
helped
if
i
could
work
on
the
grounds
has
been
carried
on
of
late
years
to
the
greater
beautification
of
the
site
a
magnificent
stairway
has
been
constructed
from
the
grade
of
the
street
to
the
level
of
the
temple
threshold
this
stairway
is
twenty
feet
in
width
with

large
square
pillars
at

the
steps

a
tread
of
twelve
inches
and
a
rise
of
six
and
of
these
there
are
one
hundred
and
there
are
nine
landings
between
top
and

each
six

chapter
xi
conclusion
as
set
forth
in
the
preceding
pages
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
proclaims
the
need
of
temples
at
the
present
time
reared
and
dedicated
to
the
service
of
the
most
high
and
affirms
that
upon
the
church
has
been
placed
the
commission
to
build
and
maintain
these
sanctuaries
and
to
administer
therein
the
saving
and
exalting
ordinances
of
the
gospel
for
both
living
and
dead
this
labor
has
already
attained
a
magnitude
at
once
impressive
and
surprising
ordinances
of
baptism
with
accompanying
confirmation
ordination
in
the
priesthood
and
sealing
both
in
the
relation
of
husband
and
wife
and
in
that
of
parents
and
children
as
solemnized
in
the
temples
of
the
current
dispensation
already
number
many
millions
and
the
continuation
of
the
work
is
marked
by
unabated
zeal
and
devotion
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
is
given
for
the
salvation
of
its
requirements
apply
alike
to
the
living
whose
blessed
privilege
it
is
to
hear
its
glad
tidings
while
in
the
flesh
and
to
the
dead
who
may
accept
the
truth
in
the
spirit
world
the
genius
of
the
gospel
is
that
of
altruism
unbounded
its
power
to
save
extends
beyond
the
portals
of
death
as
the
vicarious
work
for
the
dead
can
be
done
only
in
sanctuaries
specially
devoted
thereto
there
will
be
an
need
for
temples
so
long
as
there
are
souls
awaiting
this
ministry
the
present
is
the
age
of
greatest
import
in
all
history
embodying
as
it
does
the
fruition
of
the
past
and
the
living
seed
of
the
yet
greater
future
the
present
is
the
dispensation
of
fulness
for
which
the
dispensations
of
bygone
centuries
have
been
but
preliminary
and
preparatory
the
saving
and
sanctifying
labor
incident
to
modern
temples
surpasses
that
of
the
temples
of
earlier
times
as
the
light
of
the
full
day
exceeds
the
twilight
of
the
dawn
the
authority
of
administration
in
the
temples
of
solomon
zerubbabel
and
herod
was
that
of
the
lesser
or
aaronic
priesthood
for
the
higher
or
melchisedek
priesthood
otherwise
known
as
the
holy
priesthood
after
the
order
of
the
son
of
god
had
been
taken
from
israel
with
moses
the
temples
of
the
present
are
administered
under
the
greater
authority
the
importance
of
the
distinction
between
these
two
orders
of
priesthood
may
warrant
a
further
consideration
in
this
place
that
the
two
are
essentially
separate
and
distinct
is
made
plain
by
paul
in
his
epistle
to
the
hebrews
if
therefore
perfection
were
by
the
levitical
priesthood
for
under
it
the
people
received
the
law
what
further
need
was
there
that
another
priest
should
rise
after
the
order
of
melchisedek
and
not
be
called
after
the
order
of
aaron
for
the
priesthood
being
changed
there
is
made
of
necessity
a
change
also
of
the
law
the
apostle
emphasizes
the
superiority
of
the
priesthood
named
after
melchisedek
by
affirming
that
jesus
christ
was
a
high
priest
of
that
exalted
order
this
priesthood
was
held
and
exercised
by
the
patriarchs
in
turn
from
adam
to
moses
aaron
was
ordained
to
the
priest
office
as
were
his
sons
but
that
moses
held
superior
authority
is
abundantly
shown
after
aaron
death
his
son
eleazar
exercised
the
authority
of
high
priest
of
the
lesser
priesthood
and
even
joshua
had
to
ask
of
him
counsel
and
instruction
from
the
ministry
of
moses
to
that
of
christ
the
lesser
priesthood
alone
was
operative
upon
the
earth
excepting
only
the
instances
of
specially
delegated
authority
of
the
higher
order
such
as
is
manifest
in
the
ministrations
of
certain
chosen
prophets
isaiah
jeremiah
ezekiel
and
others
it
is
evident
that
these
prophets
seers
and
revelators
were
individually
and
specially
commissioned
but
it
appears
that
they
had
not
the
authority
to
call
and
ordain
successors
for
in
their
time
the
higher
priesthood
was
not
existent
on
earth
in
an
organized
state
with
duly
officered
quorums
not
so
with
the
aaronic
or
levitical
priesthood
however
for
the
courses
or
quorums
of
that
order
were
continued
until
the
time
of
christ
the
last
to
hold
and
exercise
the
authority
of
the
aaronic
priesthood
under
the
old
or
mosaic
dispensation
was
john
the
baptist
who
was
specially
commissioned
the
matter
is
thus
set
forth
in
a
modern
revelation
now
this
moses
plainly
taught
to
the
children
of
israel
in
the
wilderness
and
sought
diligently
to
sanctify
his
people
that
they
might
behold
the
face
of
god
but
they
hardened
their
hearts
and
could
not
endure
his
presence
therefore
the
lord
in
his
wrath
for
his
anger
was
kindled
against
them
swore
that
they
should
not
enter
into
his
rest
while
in
the
wilderness
which
rest
is
the
fulness
of
his
glory
therefore
he
took
moses
out
of
their
midst
and
the
holy
priesthood
also
and
the
lesser
priesthood
continued
which
priesthood
holdeth
the
key
of
the
ministering
of
angels
and
the
preparatory
gospel
which
gospel
is
the
gospel
of
repentance
and
of
baptism
and
the
remission
of
sins
and
the
law
of
carnal
commandments
which
the
lord
in
his
wrath
caused
to
continue
with
the
house
of
aaron
among
the
children
of
israel
until
john
whom
god
raised
up
being
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
from
his
mother
womb
for
he
was
baptized
while
he
was
yet
in
his
childhood
and

this

has
been
pronounced
one
of
the
most
remarkable
auditoriums
ever
erected
as
the

shows
it
is
simply
a
great

supported

the
immense
is
a
construction

is
the
roof
span
is
without
a
single

more
remarkable
still
the
roof
is
built
entirely
of
wood
and
was
constructed
without
nails
or
metal
spikes
the
enormous
beams
and
trusses
were
held
together
by
wooden
pegs
and
rawhide
thongs
while
the
tabernacle
was
in
course
of
construction
iron
nails
and
spikes
were
obtainable
only
as
they
were
brought
across
the
plains
by
wagon
and
team
and
the
high
cost
prevented
their
use
many
modern
buildings
present
larger
roof
spans
but
such
are
generally
constructed
of
metal
the
roof
covering
of
the
tabernacle
consisted
originally
of
wooden
shingles
these
have
been
replaced
however
by
sheet
metal
the

is
two
hundred

fifty

long
and
one

but
audiences
much
larger

a
thousand
square
feet

an

about
five
thousand

the

ten
stops
and
over
hundred
pipes
the
pipes
range
from
a
fraction
of
an
inch
to
feet
in
speaking
length
this
splendid
instrument
which
at
the
time
of
its
construction
was
the
largest
organ
in
the
country
is
the
product
of
local
talent
and
all
its

the

of

christ
our

he
was
born
at

and
the
testimony
of

at

on

his
vision
of
god
i
saw
two
personages
whose
glory
and
brightness
defy
all
description
one
of
them
spake
unto
me
and
said
this
is
my
beloved
son
hear
him
i
asked
which
of
all
the
sects
was
right
and
which
i
should
join
i
was
answered
i
must
join
none
of
them
they
were
all
wrong
they
teach
for
doctrine
the
commandments
of
men
i
received
a
promise
that
the
fulness
of
the
gospel
would
at
some
future
time
be
made
known
to
me
the
book
of
mormon
this
book
was
revealed
to
him
and
he
translated
it
by
the
gift
and
power
of
god
it
is
an
inspired
history
of
ancient
america
and
contains
the
fulness
of
the
gospel
it
is
the
american
testament
of
our
lord
and
savior
jesus
christ
the
organization
of
the
church
joseph
smith
received
divine
authority
through
the
ministration
of
angels
to
teach
the
gospel
and
administer
the
ordinances
thereof
he
established
again
in
the
earth
the
church
of
jesus
christ
organizing
it
by
the
will
and
commandment
of
god
on
the
day
of
april
he
also
received
commission
to
gather
israel
and
establish
zion
on
this
land
of
america
to
erect
temples
and
perform
ordinances
therein
both
for
the
living
and
the
dead
and
prepare
the
way
for
the
glorious
coming
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
to
reign
on
earth
the
tablet
on
the
back
of
the
pedestal
bears
the
following
inscription
from
the
teachings
of
joseph
smith
the
glory
of
god
is
intelligence
it
is
impossible
for
a
man
to
be
saved
in
ignorance
whatever
principle
of
intelligence
we
attain
unto
in
this
life
will
rise
with
us
in
the
resurrection
there
is
a
law
irrevocably
decreed
in
heaven
before
the
foundations
of
this
world
upon
which
all
blessings
are
predicated
and
when
we
obtain
any
blessing
from
god
it
is
by
obedience
to
that
law
on
which
it
is
predicated
this
is
the
work
and
glory
of
god
to
bring
to
pass
the
immortality
and
eternal
life
of
man
adam
fell
that
man
might
be
and
men
are
that
the
might
have
joy
the
intelligence
of
spirits
had
no
beginning
neither
will
it
have
an
end
jesus
was
in
the
beginning
with
the
father
man
was
also
in
the
beginning
with
god
intelligence
or
the
light
of
truth
was
not
created
or
made
neither
indeed
can
be
the
spirit
and
body
is
the
soul
of
man
and
the
resurrection
from
the
dead
is
the
redemption
of
the
soul
it
is
the
first
principle
of
the
gospel
to
know
for
a
certainty
the
character
of
god
and
to
know
that
man
as
moses
may
