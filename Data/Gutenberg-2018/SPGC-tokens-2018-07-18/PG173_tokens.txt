chapter
i
a
gentleman
to
see
you
doctor
from
across
the
common
a
clock
sounded
the
i
said
a
late
visitor
show
him
up
if
you
please
i
pushed
my
writing
aside
and
tilted
the
as
footsteps
sounded
on
the
landing
the
next
moment
i
had
jumped
to
my
feet
for
a
tall
lean
man
with
his
face
to
the
hue
of
coffee
entered
and
extended
both
hands
with
a
cry
good
old
petrie
did
expect
me
i
swear
it
was
nayland
smith
whom
i
had
thought
to
be
in
burma
smith
i
said
and
gripped
his
hands
hard
this
is
a
delightful
surprise
whatever
however
excuse
me
petrie
he
broke
in
do
put
it
down
to
the
sun
and
he
put
out
the
lamp
plunging
the
room
into
darkness
i
was
too
surprised
to
speak
no
doubt
you
will
think
me
mad
he
continued
and
dimly
i
could
see
him
at
the
window
peering
out
into
the
road
but
before
you
are
many
hours
older
you
will
know
that
i
have
good
reason
to
be
cautious
ah
nothing
suspicious
perhaps
i
am
first
this
time
and
stepping
back
to
the
he
relighted
the
lamp
mysterious
enough
for
you
he
laughed
and
glanced
at
my
unfinished
a
story
eh
from
which
i
gather
that
the
district
is
beastly
healthy
what
petrie
well
i
can
put
some
material
in
your
way
that
if
sheer
uncanny
mystery
is
a
marketable
commodity
ought
to
make
you
independent
of
influenza
and
broken
legs
and
shattered
nerves
and
all
the
rest
i
surveyed
him
doubtfully
but
there
was
nothing
in
his
appearance
to
justify
me
in
supposing
him
to
suffer
from
delusions
his
eyes
were
too
bright
certainly
and
a
hardness
now
had
crept
over
his
face
i
got
out
the
whisky
and
siphon
saying
you
have
taken
your
leave
early
i
am
not
on
leave
he
replied
and
slowly
filled
his
pipe
i
am
on
duty
on
duty
i
exclaimed
what
are
you
moved
to
london
or
something
i
have
got
a
roving
commission
petrie
and
it
does
rest
with
me
where
i
am
nor
where
i
shall
be
there
was
something
ominous
in
the
words
and
putting
down
my
glass
its
contents
untasted
i
faced
round
and
looked
him
squarely
in
the
eyes
out
with
it
i
said
what
is
it
all
about
smith
suddenly
stood
up
and
stripped
off
his
coat
rolling
back
his
left
he
revealed
a
wound
in
the
fleshy
part
of
the
forearm
it
was
quite
healed
but
curiously
striated
for
an
inch
or
so
around
ever
seen
one
like
it
he
asked
not
exactly
i
confessed
it
appears
to
have
been
deeply
cauterized
right
very
deeply
he
rapped
a
barb
steeped
in
the
venom
of
a
hamadryad
went
in
there
a
shudder
i
could
not
repress
ran
coldly
through
me
at
mention
of
that
most
deadly
of
all
the
reptiles
of
the
east
there
only
one
treatment
he
continued
rolling
his
sleeve
down
again
and
that
with
a
sharp
knife
a
match
and
a
broken
cartridge
i
lay
on
my
back
raving
for
three
days
afterwards
in
a
forest
that
stank
with
malaria
but
i
should
have
been
lying
there
now
if
i
had
hesitated
here
the
point
it
was
not
an
accident
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
it
was
a
deliberate
attempt
on
my
life
and
i
am
hard
upon
the
tracks
of
the
man
who
extracted
that
venom
patiently
drop
by
drop
from
the
of
the
snake
who
prepared
that
arrow
and
who
caused
it
to
be
shot
at
me
what
fiend
is
this
a
fiend
who
unless
my
calculations
are
at
fault
is
now
in
london
and
who
regularly
wars
with
pleasant
weapons
of
that
kind
petrie
i
have
traveled
from
burma
not
in
the
interests
of
the
british
government
merely
but
in
the
interests
of
the
entire
white
race
and
i
honestly
believe
though
i
pray
i
may
be
wrong
that
its
survival
depends
largely
upon
the
success
of
my
mission
to
say
that
i
was
perplexed
conveys
no
idea
of
the
mental
chaos
created
by
these
extraordinary
statements
for
into
my
humdrum
suburban
life
nayland
smith
had
brought
fantasy
of
the
wildest
i
did
not
know
what
to
think
what
to
believe
i
am
wasting
precious
time
he
rapped
decisively
and
draining
his
glass
he
stood
up
i
came
straight
to
you
because
you
are
the
only
man
i
dare
to
trust
except
the
big
chief
at
headquarters
you
are
the
only
person
in
england
i
hope
who
knows
that
nayland
smith
has
quitted
burma
i
must
have
someone
with
me
petrie
all
the
time
imperative
can
you
put
me
up
here
and
spare
a
few
days
to
the
strangest
business
i
promise
you
that
ever
was
recorded
in
fact
or
fiction
i
agreed
readily
enough
for
unfortunately
my
professional
duties
were
not
onerous
good
man
he
cried
wringing
my
hand
in
his
impetuous
way
we
start
now
what
i
had
thought
of
turning
in
i
must
admit
i
have
not
dared
to
sleep
for
hours
except
in
stretches
but
there
is
one
move
that
must
be
made
and
immediately
i
must
warn
sir
crichton
davey
sir
crichton
davey
of
the
india
petrie
he
is
a
doomed
man
unless
he
follows
my
instructions
without
question
without
hesitation
before
heaven
nothing
can
save
him
i
do
not
know
when
the
blow
will
fall
how
it
will
fall
nor
from
whence
but
i
know
that
my
first
duty
is
to
warn
him
let
us
walk
down
to
the
corner
of
the
common
and
get
a
taxi
how
strangely
does
the
adventurous
intrude
upon
the
humdrum
for
when
it
intrudes
at
all
more
often
than
not
its
intrusion
is
sudden
and
unlooked
for
we
may
seek
for
romance
and
fail
to
find
it
unsought
it
lies
in
wait
for
us
at
most
prosaic
corners
of
highway
the
drive
that
night
though
it
divided
the
drably
commonplace
from
the
wildly
bizarre
though
it
was
the
bridge
between
the
ordinary
and
the
outre
has
left
no
impression
upon
my
mind
into
the
heart
of
a
weird
mystery
the
cab
bore
me
and
in
reviewing
my
memories
of
those
days
i
wonder
that
the
busy
thoroughfares
through
which
we
passed
did
not
display
before
my
eyes
signs
and
portents
warnings
it
was
not
so
i
recall
nothing
of
the
route
and
little
of
import
that
passed
between
us
we
both
were
strangely
silent
i
think
until
we
were
come
to
our
journey
end
then
what
this
muttered
my
friend
hoarsely
constables
were
moving
on
a
little
crowd
of
curious
idlers
who
pressed
about
the
steps
of
sir
crichton
davey
house
and
sought
to
peer
in
at
the
open
door
without
waiting
for
the
cab
to
draw
up
to
the
curb
nayland
smith
recklessly
leaped
out
and
i
followed
close
at
his
heels
what
has
happened
he
demanded
breathlessly
of
a
constable
the
latter
glanced
at
him
doubtfully
but
something
in
his
voice
and
bearing
commanded
respect
sir
crichton
davey
has
been
killed
sir
smith
lurched
back
as
though
he
had
received
a
physical
blow
and
clutched
my
shoulder
convulsively
beneath
the
heavy
tan
his
face
had
blanched
and
his
eyes
were
set
in
a
stare
of
horror
my
god
he
whispered
i
am
too
late
with
clenched
fists
he
turned
and
pressing
through
the
group
of
loungers
bounded
up
the
steps
in
the
hall
a
man
who
unmistakably
was
a
scotland
yard
official
stood
talking
to
a
footman
other
members
of
the
household
were
moving
about
more
or
less
aimlessly
and
the
chilly
hand
of
king
fear
had
touched
one
and
all
for
as
they
came
and
went
they
glanced
ever
over
their
shoulders
as
if
each
shadow
cloaked
a
menace
and
listened
as
it
seemed
for
some
sound
which
they
dreaded
to
hear
smith
strode
up
to
the
detective
and
showed
him
a
card
upon
glancing
at
which
the
scotland
yard
man
said
something
in
a
low
voice
and
nodding
touched
his
hat
to
smith
in
a
respectful
manner
a
few
brief
questions
and
answers
and
in
gloomy
silence
we
followed
the
detective
up
the
heavily
carpeted
stair
along
a
corridor
lined
with
pictures
and
busts
and
into
a
large
library
a
group
of
people
were
in
this
room
and
one
in
whom
i
recognized
chalmers
cleeve
of
harley
street
was
bending
over
a
motionless
form
stretched
upon
a
couch
another
door
communicated
with
a
small
study
and
through
the
opening
i
could
see
a
man
on
all
fours
examining
the
carpet
the
uncomfortable
sense
of
hush
the
group
about
the
physician
the
bizarre
figure
crawling
across
the
inner
room
and
the
grim
hub
around
which
all
this
ominous
activity
turned
made
up
a
scene
that
etched
itself
indelibly
on
my
mind
as
we
entered
cleeve
straightened
himself
frowning
thoughtfully
frankly
i
do
not
care
to
venture
any
opinion
at
present
regarding
the
immediate
cause
of
death
he
said
sir
crichton
was
addicted
to
cocaine
but
there
are
indications
which
are
not
in
accordance
with
i
fear
that
only
a
can
establish
the
facts
if
he
added
we
ever
arrive
at
them
a
most
mysterious
case
smith
stepping
forward
and
engaging
the
famous
pathologist
in
conversation
i
seized
the
opportunity
to
examine
sir
crichton
body
the
dead
man
was
in
evening
dress
but
wore
an
old
he
had
been
of
spare
but
hardy
build
with
thin
aquiline
features
which
now
were
oddly
puffy
as
were
his
clenched
hands
i
pushed
back
his
sleeve
and
saw
the
marks
of
the
hypodermic
syringe
upon
his
left
arm
quite
mechanically
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
right
arm
it
was
unscarred
but
on
the
back
of
the
hand
was
a
faint
red
mark
not
unlike
the
imprint
of
painted
lips
i
examined
it
closely
and
even
tried
to
rub
it
off
but
it
evidently
was
caused
by
some
morbid
process
of
local
inflammation
if
it
were
not
a
birthmark
turning
to
a
pale
young
man
whom
i
had
understood
to
be
sir
private
secretary
i
drew
his
attention
to
this
mark
and
inquired
if
it
were
constitutional
it
is
not
sir
answered
cleeve
overhearing
my
question
i
have
already
made
that
inquiry
does
it
suggest
anything
to
your
mind
i
must
confess
that
it
affords
me
no
assistance
nothing
i
replied
it
is
most
curious
excuse
me
burboyne
said
smith
now
turning
to
the
secretary
but
inspector
weymouth
will
tell
you
that
i
act
with
authority
i
understand
that
sir
crichton
was
seized
with
illness
in
his
study
yes
at
ten
i
was
working
here
in
the
library
and
he
inside
as
was
our
custom
the
communicating
door
was
kept
closed
yes
always
it
was
open
for
a
minute
or
less
about
when
a
message
came
for
sir
crichton
i
took
it
in
to
him
and
he
then
seemed
in
his
usual
health
what
was
the
message
i
could
not
say
it
was
brought
by
a
district
messenger
and
he
placed
it
beside
him
on
the
table
it
is
there
now
no
doubt
and
at
ten
sir
crichton
suddenly
burst
open
the
door
and
threw
himself
with
a
scream
into
the
library
i
ran
to
him
but
he
waved
me
back
his
eyes
were
glaring
horribly
i
had
just
reached
his
side
when
he
fell
writhing
upon
the
floor
he
seemed
past
speech
but
as
i
raised
him
and
laid
him
upon
the
couch
he
gasped
something
that
sounded
like
red
hand
before
i
could
get
to
bell
or
telephone
he
was
dead
burboyne
voice
shook
as
he
spoke
the
words
and
smith
seemed
to
find
this
evidence
confusing
you
do
not
think
he
referred
to
the
mark
on
his
own
hand
i
think
not
from
the
direction
of
his
last
glance
i
feel
sure
he
referred
to
something
in
the
study
what
did
you
do
having
summoned
the
servants
i
ran
into
the
study
but
there
was
absolutely
nothing
unusual
to
be
seen
the
windows
were
closed
and
fastened
he
worked
with
closed
windows
in
the
hottest
weather
there
is
no
other
door
for
the
study
occupies
the
end
of
a
narrow
wing
so
that
no
one
could
possibly
have
gained
access
to
it
whilst
i
was
in
the
library
unseen
by
me
had
someone
concealed
himself
in
the
study
earlier
in
the
evening
and
i
am
convinced
that
it
offers
no
he
could
only
have
come
out
again
by
passing
through
here
nayland
smith
tugged
at
the
lobe
of
his
left
ear
as
was
his
habit
when
meditating
you
had
been
at
work
here
in
this
way
for
some
time
yes
sir
crichton
was
preparing
an
important
book
had
anything
unusual
occurred
prior
to
this
evening
yes
said
burboyne
with
evident
perplexity
though
i
attached
no
importance
to
it
at
the
time
three
nights
ago
sir
crichton
came
out
to
me
and
appeared
very
nervous
but
at
times
his
nerves
you
know
well
on
this
occasion
he
asked
me
to
search
the
study
he
had
an
idea
that
something
was
concealed
there
some
thing
or
someone
was
the
word
he
used
i
searched
but
fruitlessly
and
he
seemed
quite
satisfied
and
returned
to
his
work
thank
you
burboyne
my
friend
and
i
would
like
a
few
private
investigation
in
the
study
chapter
ii
sir
crichton
davey
study
was
a
small
one
and
a
glance
sufficed
to
show
that
as
the
secretary
had
said
it
offered
no
it
was
heavily
carpeted
and
of
burmese
and
chinese
ornaments
and
curios
and
upon
the
mantelpiece
stood
several
framed
photographs
which
showed
this
to
be
the
sanctum
of
a
wealthy
bachelor
who
was
no
misogynist
a
map
of
the
indian
empire
occupied
the
larger
part
of
one
wall
the
grate
was
empty
for
the
weather
was
extremely
warm
and
a
lamp
on
the
littered
afforded
the
only
light
the
air
was
stale
for
both
windows
were
closed
and
fastened
smith
immediately
pounced
upon
a
large
square
envelope
that
lay
beside
the
sir
crichton
had
not
even
troubled
to
open
it
but
my
friend
did
so
it
contained
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
smell
he
directed
handing
the
letter
to
me
i
raised
it
to
my
nostrils
it
was
scented
with
some
pungent
perfume
what
is
it
i
asked
it
is
a
rather
rare
essential
oil
was
the
reply
which
i
have
met
with
before
though
never
in
europe
i
begin
to
understand
petrie
he
tilted
the
and
made
a
close
examination
of
the
scraps
of
paper
matches
and
other
debris
that
lay
in
the
grate
and
on
the
hearth
i
took
up
a
copper
vase
from
the
mantelpiece
and
was
examining
it
curiously
when
he
turned
a
strange
expression
upon
his
face
put
that
back
old
man
he
said
quietly
much
surprised
i
did
as
he
directed
do
touch
anything
in
the
room
it
may
be
dangerous
something
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
chilled
me
and
i
hastily
replaced
the
vase
and
stood
by
the
door
of
the
study
watching
him
search
methodically
every
inch
of
the
room
behind
the
books
in
all
the
ornaments
in
table
drawers
in
cupboards
on
shelves
that
will
do
he
said
at
last
there
is
nothing
here
and
i
have
no
time
to
search
farther
we
returned
to
the
library
inspector
weymouth
said
my
friend
i
have
a
particular
reason
for
asking
that
sir
crichton
body
be
removed
from
this
room
at
once
and
the
library
locked
let
no
one
be
admitted
on
any
pretense
whatever
until
you
hear
from
me
it
spoke
volumes
for
the
mysterious
credentials
borne
by
my
friend
that
the
man
from
scotland
yard
accepted
his
orders
without
demur
and
after
a
brief
chat
with
burboyne
smith
passed
briskly
downstairs
in
the
hall
a
man
who
looked
like
a
groom
out
of
livery
was
waiting
are
you
wills
asked
smith
yes
sir
it
was
you
who
heard
a
cry
of
some
kind
at
the
rear
of
the
house
about
the
time
of
sir
crichton
death
yes
sir
i
was
locking
the
garage
door
and
happening
to
look
up
at
the
window
of
sir
crichton
study
i
saw
him
jump
out
of
his
chair
where
he
used
to
sit
at
his
writing
sir
you
could
see
his
shadow
on
the
blind
next
minute
i
heard
a
call
out
in
the
lane
what
kind
of
call
the
man
whom
the
uncanny
happening
clearly
had
frightened
seemed
puzzled
for
a
suitable
description
a
sort
of
wail
sir
he
said
at
last
i
never
heard
anything
like
it
before
and
do
want
to
again
like
this
inquired
smith
and
he
uttered
a
low
wailing
cry
impossible
to
describe
wills
perceptibly
shuddered
and
indeed
it
was
an
eerie
sound
the
same
sir
i
think
he
said
but
much
louder
that
will
do
said
smith
and
i
thought
i
detected
a
note
of
triumph
in
his
voice
but
stay
take
us
through
to
the
back
of
the
house
the
man
bowed
and
led
the
way
so
that
shortly
we
found
ourselves
in
a
small
paved
courtyard
it
was
a
perfect
summer
night
and
the
deep
blue
vault
above
was
jeweled
with
myriads
of
starry
points
how
impossible
it
seemed
to
reconcile
that
vast
eternal
calm
with
the
hideous
passions
and
fiendish
agencies
which
that
night
had
loosed
a
soul
upon
the
infinite
up
yonder
are
the
study
windows
sir
over
that
wall
on
your
left
is
the
back
lane
from
which
the
cry
came
and
beyond
is
regent
park
are
the
study
windows
visible
from
there
oh
yes
sir
who
occupies
the
adjoining
house
sir
but
the
family
is
out
of
town
those
iron
stairs
are
a
means
of
communication
between
the
domestic
offices
and
the
servants
quarters
i
take
it
yes
sir
then
send
someone
to
make
my
business
known
to
the
housekeeper
i
want
to
examine
those
stairs
singular
though
my
friend
proceedings
appeared
to
me
i
had
ceased
to
wonder
at
anything
since
nayland
smith
arrival
at
my
rooms
i
seemed
to
have
been
moving
through
the
fitful
phases
of
a
nightmare
my
friend
account
of
how
he
came
by
the
wound
in
his
arm
the
scene
on
our
arrival
at
the
house
of
sir
crichton
davey
the
secretary
story
of
the
dying
man
cry
the
red
hand
the
hidden
perils
of
the
study
the
wail
in
the
lane
all
were
fitter
incidents
of
delirium
than
of
sane
reality
so
when
a
butler
made
us
known
to
a
nervous
old
lady
who
proved
to
be
the
housekeeper
of
the
residence
i
was
not
surprised
at
smith
saying
lounge
up
and
down
outside
petrie
everyone
has
cleared
off
now
it
is
getting
late
keep
your
eyes
open
and
be
on
your
guard
i
thought
i
had
the
start
but
he
is
here
before
me
and
what
is
worse
he
probably
knows
by
now
that
i
am
here
too
with
which
he
entered
the
house
and
left
me
out
in
the
square
with
leisure
to
think
to
try
to
understand
the
crowd
which
usually
haunts
the
scene
of
a
sensational
crime
had
been
cleared
away
and
it
had
been
circulated
that
sir
crichton
had
died
from
natural
causes
the
intense
heat
having
driven
most
of
the
residents
out
of
town
practically
i
had
the
square
to
myself
and
i
gave
myself
up
to
a
brief
consideration
of
the
mystery
in
which
i
so
suddenly
had
found
myself
involved
by
what
agency
had
sir
crichton
met
his
death
did
nayland
smith
know
i
rather
suspected
that
he
did
what
was
the
hidden
significance
of
the
perfumed
envelope
who
was
that
mysterious
personage
whom
smith
so
evidently
dreaded
who
had
attempted
his
life
who
presumably
had
murdered
sir
crichton
sir
crichton
davey
during
the
time
that
he
had
held
office
in
india
and
during
his
long
term
of
service
at
home
had
earned
the
good
will
of
all
british
and
native
alike
who
was
his
secret
enemy
something
touched
me
lightly
on
the
shoulder
i
turned
with
my
heart
fluttering
like
a
child
this
night
work
had
imposed
a
severe
strain
even
upon
my
callous
nerves
a
girl
wrapped
in
a
hooded
stood
at
my
elbow
and
as
she
glanced
up
at
me
i
thought
that
i
never
had
seen
a
face
so
seductively
lovely
nor
of
so
unusual
a
type
with
the
skin
of
a
perfect
blonde
she
had
eyes
and
lashes
as
black
as
a
creole
which
together
with
her
full
red
lips
told
me
that
this
beautiful
stranger
whose
touch
had
so
startled
me
was
not
a
child
of
our
northern
shores
forgive
me
she
said
speaking
with
an
odd
pretty
accent
and
laying
a
slim
hand
with
jeweled
fingers
confidingly
upon
my
arm
if
i
startled
you
but
is
it
true
that
sir
crichton
davey
has
been
murdered
i
looked
into
her
big
questioning
eyes
a
harsh
suspicion
laboring
in
my
mind
but
could
read
nothing
in
their
mysterious
depths
only
i
wondered
anew
at
my
questioner
beauty
the
grotesque
idea
momentarily
possessed
me
that
were
the
bloom
of
her
red
lips
due
to
art
and
not
to
nature
their
kiss
would
leave
though
not
indelibly
just
such
a
mark
as
i
had
seen
upon
the
dead
man
hand
but
i
dismissed
the
fantastic
notion
as
bred
of
the
night
horrors
and
worthy
only
of
a
mediaeval
legend
no
doubt
she
was
some
friend
or
acquaintance
of
sir
crichton
who
lived
close
by
i
can
not
say
that
he
has
been
murdered
i
replied
acting
upon
the
latter
supposition
and
seeking
to
tell
her
what
she
asked
as
gently
as
possible
but
he
is
dead
i
nodded
she
closed
her
eyes
and
uttered
a
low
moaning
sound
swaying
dizzily
thinking
she
was
about
to
swoon
i
threw
my
arm
round
her
shoulder
to
support
her
but
she
smiled
sadly
and
pushed
me
gently
away
i
am
quite
well
thank
you
she
said
you
are
certain
let
me
walk
with
you
until
you
feel
quite
sure
of
yourself
she
shook
her
head
flashed
a
rapid
glance
at
me
with
her
beautiful
eyes
and
looked
away
in
a
sort
of
sorrowful
embarrassment
for
which
i
was
entirely
at
a
loss
to
account
suddenly
she
resumed
i
can
not
let
my
name
be
mentioned
in
this
dreadful
matter
but
i
think
i
have
some
information
for
the
police
will
you
give
this
to
whomever
you
think
proper
she
handed
me
a
sealed
envelope
again
met
my
eyes
with
one
of
her
dazzling
glances
and
hurried
away
she
had
gone
no
more
than
ten
or
twelve
yards
and
i
still
was
standing
bewildered
watching
her
graceful
retreating
figure
when
she
turned
abruptly
and
came
back
without
looking
directly
at
me
but
alternately
glancing
towards
a
distant
corner
of
the
square
and
towards
the
house
of
she
made
the
following
extraordinary
request
if
you
would
do
me
a
very
great
service
for
which
i
always
would
be
grateful
she
glanced
at
me
with
passionate
intentness
when
you
have
given
my
message
to
the
proper
person
leave
him
and
do
not
go
near
him
any
more
before
i
could
find
words
to
reply
she
gathered
up
her
cloak
and
ran
before
i
could
determine
whether
or
not
to
follow
her
for
her
words
had
aroused
anew
all
my
worst
suspicions
she
had
disappeared
i
heard
the
whir
of
a
restarted
motor
at
no
great
distance
and
in
the
instant
that
nayland
smith
came
running
down
the
steps
i
knew
that
i
had
nodded
at
my
post
smith
i
cried
as
he
joined
me
tell
me
what
we
must
do
and
rapidly
i
acquainted
him
with
the
incident
my
friend
looked
very
grave
then
a
grim
smile
crept
round
his
lips
she
was
a
big
card
to
play
he
said
but
he
did
not
know
that
i
held
one
to
beat
it
what
you
know
this
girl
who
is
she
she
is
one
of
the
finest
weapons
in
the
enemy
armory
petrie
but
a
woman
is
a
sword
and
treacherous
to
our
great
good
fortune
she
has
formed
a
sudden
predilection
characteristically
oriental
for
yourself
oh
you
may
scoff
but
it
is
evident
she
was
employed
to
get
this
letter
placed
in
my
hands
give
it
to
me
i
did
so
she
has
succeeded
smell
he
held
the
envelope
under
my
nose
and
with
a
sudden
sense
of
nausea
i
recognized
the
strange
perfume
you
know
what
this
presaged
in
sir
crichton
case
can
you
doubt
any
longer
she
did
not
want
you
to
share
my
fate
petrie
smith
i
said
unsteadily
i
have
followed
your
lead
blindly
in
this
horrible
business
and
have
not
pressed
for
an
explanation
but
i
must
insist
before
i
go
one
step
farther
upon
knowing
what
it
all
means
just
a
few
steps
farther
he
rejoined
as
far
as
a
cab
we
are
hardly
safe
here
oh
you
need
not
fear
shots
or
knives
the
man
whose
servants
are
watching
us
now
scorns
to
employ
such
clumsy
weapons
only
three
cabs
were
on
the
rank
and
as
we
entered
the
first
something
hissed
past
my
ear
missed
both
smith
and
me
by
a
miracle
and
passing
over
the
roof
of
the
taxi
presumably
fell
in
the
enclosed
garden
occupying
the
center
of
the
square
what
was
that
i
cried
get
in
quickly
smith
rapped
back
it
was
attempt
number
one
more
than
that
i
can
not
say
do
let
the
man
hear
he
has
noticed
nothing
pull
up
the
window
on
your
side
petrie
and
look
out
behind
good
we
started
the
cab
moved
off
with
a
metallic
jerk
and
i
turned
and
looked
back
through
the
little
window
in
the
rear
someone
has
got
into
another
cab
it
is
following
ours
i
think
nayland
smith
lay
back
and
laughed
unmirthfully
petrie
he
said
if
i
escape
alive
from
this
business
i
shall
know
that
i
bear
a
charmed
life
i
made
no
reply
as
he
pulled
out
the
dilapidated
pouch
and
filled
his
pipe
you
have
asked
me
to
explain
matters
he
continued
and
i
will
do
so
to
the
best
of
my
ability
you
no
doubt
wonder
why
a
servant
of
the
british
government
lately
stationed
in
burma
suddenly
appears
in
london
in
the
character
of
a
detective
i
am
here
petrie
and
i
bear
credentials
from
the
very
highest
sources
because
quite
by
accident
i
came
upon
a
clew
following
it
up
in
the
ordinary
course
of
routine
i
obtained
evidence
of
the
existence
and
malignant
activity
of
a
certain
man
at
the
present
stage
of
the
case
i
should
not
be
justified
in
terming
him
the
emissary
of
an
eastern
power
but
i
may
say
that
representations
are
shortly
to
be
made
to
that
ambassador
in
london
he
paused
and
glanced
back
towards
the
pursuing
cab
there
is
little
to
fear
until
we
arrive
home
he
said
calmly
afterwards
there
is
much
to
continue
this
man
whether
a
fanatic
or
a
duly
appointed
agent
is
unquestionably
the
most
malign
and
formidable
personality
existing
in
the
known
world
today
he
is
a
linguist
who
speaks
with
almost
equal
facility
in
any
of
the
civilized
languages
and
in
most
of
the
barbaric
he
is
an
adept
in
all
the
arts
and
sciences
which
a
great
university
could
teach
him
he
also
is
an
adept
in
certain
obscure
arts
and
sciences
which
no
university
of
can
teach
he
has
the
brains
of
any
three
men
of
genius
petrie
he
is
a
mental
giant
you
amaze
me
i
said
as
to
his
mission
among
men
why
did
jules
furneaux
fall
dead
in
a
paris
opera
house
because
of
heart
failure
no
because
his
last
speech
had
shown
that
he
held
the
key
to
the
secret
of
tongking
what
became
of
the
grand
duke
stanislaus
elopement
suicide
nothing
of
the
kind
he
alone
was
fully
alive
to
russia
growing
peril
he
alone
knew
the
truth
about
mongolia
why
was
sir
crichton
davey
murdered
because
had
the
work
he
was
engaged
upon
ever
seen
the
light
it
would
have
shown
him
to
be
the
only
living
englishman
who
understood
the
importance
of
the
tibetan
frontiers
i
say
to
you
solemnly
petrie
that
these
are
but
a
few
is
there
a
man
who
would
arouse
the
west
to
a
sense
of
the
awakening
of
the
east
who
would
teach
the
deaf
to
hear
the
blind
to
see
that
the
millions
only
await
their
leader
he
will
die
and
this
is
only
one
phase
of
the
devilish
campaign
the
others
i
can
merely
surmise
but
smith
this
is
almost
incredible
what
perverted
genius
controls
this
awful
secret
movement
imagine
a
person
tall
lean
and
feline
with
a
brow
like
shakespeare
and
a
face
like
satan
a
skull
and
long
magnetic
eyes
of
the
true
invest
him
with
all
the
cruel
cunning
of
an
entire
eastern
race
accumulated
in
one
giant
intellect
with
all
the
resources
of
science
past
and
present
with
all
the
resources
if
you
will
of
a
wealthy
government
which
however
already
has
denied
all
knowledge
of
his
existence
imagine
that
awful
being
and
you
have
a
mental
picture
of
the
yellow
peril
incarnate
in
one
man
chapter
iii
i
sank
into
an
in
my
rooms
and
gulped
down
a
strong
peg
of
brandy
we
have
been
followed
here
i
said
why
did
you
make
no
attempt
to
throw
the
pursuers
off
the
track
to
have
them
intercepted
smith
laughed
useless
in
the
first
place
wherever
we
went
he
would
find
us
and
of
what
use
to
arrest
his
creatures
we
could
prove
nothing
against
them
further
it
is
evident
that
an
attempt
is
to
be
made
upon
my
life
and
by
the
same
means
that
proved
so
successful
in
the
case
of
poor
sir
crichton
his
square
jaw
grew
truculently
prominent
and
he
leapt
stormily
to
his
feet
shaking
his
clenched
fists
towards
the
window
the
villain
he
cried
the
fiendishly
clever
villain
i
suspected
that
sir
crichton
was
next
and
i
was
right
but
i
came
too
late
petrie
that
hits
me
hard
old
man
to
think
that
i
knew
and
yet
failed
to
save
him
he
resumed
his
seat
smoking
hard
has
made
the
blunder
common
to
all
men
of
unusual
genius
he
said
he
has
underrated
his
adversary
he
has
not
given
me
credit
for
perceiving
the
meaning
of
the
scented
messages
he
has
thrown
away
one
powerful
weapon
to
get
such
a
message
into
my
hands
and
he
thinks
that
once
safe
within
doors
i
shall
sleep
unsuspecting
and
die
as
sir
crichton
died
but
without
the
indiscretion
of
your
charming
friend
i
should
have
known
what
to
expect
when
i
receive
her
which
by
the
way
consists
of
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
smith
i
broke
in
who
is
she
she
is
either
daughter
his
wife
or
his
slave
i
am
inclined
to
believe
the
last
for
she
has
no
will
but
his
will
except
with
a
quizzical
glance
in
a
certain
instance
how
can
you
jest
with
some
awful
thing
heaven
knows
what
hanging
over
your
head
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
perfumed
envelopes
how
did
sir
crichton
die
he
died
of
the
zayat
kiss
ask
me
what
that
is
and
i
reply
do
not
know
the
zayats
are
the
burmese
caravanserais
or
along
a
certain
route
upon
which
i
set
eyes
for
the
first
and
only
time
upon
travelers
who
use
them
sometimes
die
as
sir
crichton
died
with
nothing
to
show
the
cause
of
death
but
a
little
mark
upon
the
neck
face
or
limb
which
has
earned
in
those
parts
the
title
of
the
kiss
the
along
that
route
are
shunned
now
i
have
my
theory
and
i
hope
to
prove
it
if
i
live
it
will
be
one
more
broken
weapon
in
his
fiendish
armory
and
it
is
thus
and
thus
only
that
i
can
hope
to
crush
him
this
was
my
principal
reason
for
not
enlightening
cleeve
even
walls
have
ears
where
is
concerned
so
i
feigned
ignorance
of
the
meaning
of
the
mark
knowing
that
he
would
be
almost
certain
to
employ
the
same
methods
upon
some
other
victim
i
wanted
an
opportunity
to
study
the
zayat
kiss
in
operation
and
i
shall
have
one
but
the
scented
envelopes
in
the
swampy
forests
of
the
district
i
have
referred
to
a
rare
species
of
orchid
almost
green
and
with
a
peculiar
scent
is
sometimes
met
with
i
recognized
the
heavy
perfume
at
once
i
take
it
that
the
thing
which
kills
the
traveler
is
attracted
by
this
orchid
you
will
notice
that
the
perfume
clings
to
whatever
it
touches
i
doubt
if
it
can
be
washed
off
in
the
ordinary
way
after
at
least
one
unsuccessful
attempt
to
kill
sir
crichton
you
recall
that
he
thought
there
was
something
concealed
in
his
study
on
a
previous
occasion
hit
upon
the
perfumed
envelopes
he
may
have
a
supply
of
these
green
orchids
in
his
possession
possibly
to
feed
the
creature
what
creature
how
could
any
kind
of
creature
have
got
into
sir
crichton
room
tonight
you
no
doubt
observed
that
i
examined
the
grate
of
the
study
i
found
a
fair
quantity
of
fallen
soot
i
at
once
assumed
since
it
appeared
to
be
the
only
means
of
entrance
that
something
has
been
dropped
down
and
i
took
it
for
granted
that
the
thing
whatever
it
was
must
still
be
concealed
either
in
the
study
or
in
the
library
but
when
i
had
obtained
the
evidence
of
the
groom
wills
i
perceived
that
the
cry
from
the
lane
or
from
the
park
was
a
signal
i
noted
that
the
movements
of
anyone
seated
at
the
study
table
were
visible
in
shadow
on
the
blind
and
that
the
study
occupied
the
corner
of
a
wing
and
therefore
had
a
short
chimney
what
did
the
signal
mean
that
sir
crichton
had
leaped
up
from
his
chair
and
either
had
received
the
zayat
kiss
or
had
seen
the
thing
which
someone
on
the
roof
had
lowered
down
the
straight
chimney
it
was
the
signal
to
withdraw
that
deadly
thing
by
means
of
the
iron
stairway
at
the
rear
of
i
quite
easily
gained
access
to
the
roof
above
sir
crichton
study
and
i
found
this
out
from
his
pocket
nayland
smith
drew
a
tangled
piece
of
silk
mixed
up
with
which
were
a
brass
ring
and
a
number
of
unusually
nipped
on
in
the
manner
usual
on
a
my
theory
proven
he
resumed
not
anticipating
a
search
on
the
roof
they
had
been
careless
this
was
to
weight
the
line
and
to
prevent
the
creature
clinging
to
the
walls
of
the
chimney
directly
it
had
dropped
in
the
grate
however
by
means
of
this
ring
i
assume
that
the
weighted
line
was
withdrawn
and
the
thing
was
only
held
by
one
slender
thread
which
sufficed
though
to
draw
it
back
again
when
it
had
done
its
work
it
might
have
got
tangled
of
course
but
they
reckoned
on
its
making
straight
up
the
carved
leg
of
the
for
the
prepared
envelope
from
there
to
the
hand
of
sir
crichton
which
from
having
touched
the
envelope
would
also
be
scented
with
the
perfume
was
a
certain
move
my
god
how
horrible
i
exclaimed
and
glanced
apprehensively
into
the
dusky
shadows
of
the
room
what
is
your
theory
respecting
this
creature
what
shape
what
color
it
is
something
that
moves
rapidly
and
silently
i
will
venture
no
more
at
present
but
i
think
it
works
in
the
dark
the
study
was
dark
remember
save
for
the
bright
patch
beneath
the
i
have
observed
that
the
rear
of
this
house
is
right
up
to
and
above
your
bedroom
let
us
make
ostentatious
preparations
to
retire
and
i
think
we
may
rely
upon
servants
to
attempt
my
removal
at
any
rate
if
not
yours
but
my
dear
fellow
it
is
a
climb
of
feet
at
the
very
least
you
remember
the
cry
in
the
back
lane
it
suggested
something
to
me
and
i
tested
my
idea
successfully
it
was
the
cry
of
a
dacoit
oh
dacoity
though
quiescent
is
by
no
means
extinct
has
dacoits
in
his
train
and
probably
it
is
one
who
operates
the
zayat
kiss
since
it
was
a
dacoit
who
watched
the
window
of
the
study
this
evening
to
such
a
man
an
wall
is
a
grand
staircase
the
horrible
events
that
followed
are
punctuated
in
my
mind
by
the
striking
of
a
distant
clock
it
is
singular
how
trivialities
thus
assert
themselves
in
moments
of
high
tension
i
will
proceed
then
by
these
punctuations
to
the
coming
of
the
horror
that
it
was
written
we
should
encounter
the
clock
across
the
common
struck
two
having
removed
all
traces
of
the
scent
of
the
orchid
from
our
hands
with
a
solution
of
ammonia
smith
and
i
had
followed
the
programme
laid
down
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
reach
the
rear
of
the
house
by
simply
climbing
a
fence
and
we
did
not
doubt
that
seeing
the
light
go
out
in
the
front
our
unseen
watcher
would
proceed
to
the
back
the
room
was
a
large
one
and
we
had
made
up
my
at
one
end
stuffing
odds
and
ends
under
the
clothes
to
lend
the
appearance
of
a
sleeper
which
device
we
also
had
adopted
in
the
case
of
the
larger
bed
the
perfumed
envelope
lay
upon
a
little
coffee
table
in
the
center
of
the
floor
and
smith
with
an
electric
pocket
lamp
a
revolver
and
a
brassey
beside
him
sat
on
cushions
in
the
shadow
of
the
wardrobe
i
occupied
a
post
between
the
windows
no
unusual
sound
so
far
had
disturbed
the
stillness
of
the
night
save
for
the
muffled
throb
of
the
rare
cars
passing
the
front
of
the
house
our
vigil
had
been
a
silent
one
the
full
moon
had
painted
about
the
floor
weird
shadows
of
the
clustering
ivy
spreading
the
design
gradually
from
the
door
across
the
room
past
the
little
table
where
the
envelope
lay
and
finally
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
the
distant
clock
struck
a
two
a
slight
breeze
stirred
the
ivy
and
a
new
shadow
added
itself
to
the
extreme
edge
of
the
moon
design
something
rose
inch
by
inch
above
the
sill
of
the
westerly
window
i
could
see
only
its
shadow
but
a
sharp
sibilant
breath
from
smith
told
me
that
he
from
his
post
could
see
the
cause
of
the
shadow
every
nerve
in
my
body
seemed
to
be
strung
tensely
i
was
icy
cold
expectant
and
prepared
for
whatever
horror
was
upon
us
the
shadow
became
stationary
the
dacoit
was
studying
the
interior
of
the
room
then
it
suddenly
lengthened
and
craning
my
head
to
the
left
i
saw
a
lithe
form
surmounted
by
a
yellow
face
sketchy
in
the
moonlight
pressed
against
the
one
thin
brown
hand
appeared
over
the
edge
of
the
lowered
sash
which
it
grasped
and
then
another
the
man
made
absolutely
no
sound
whatever
the
second
hand
disappeared
and
reappeared
it
held
a
small
square
box
there
was
a
very
faint
click
the
dacoit
swung
himself
below
the
window
with
the
agility
of
an
ape
as
with
a
dull
muffled
thud
something
dropped
upon
the
carpet
stand
still
for
your
life
came
smith
voice
a
beam
of
white
leaped
out
across
the
room
and
played
full
upon
the
in
the
center
prepared
as
i
was
for
something
horrible
i
know
that
i
paled
at
sight
of
the
thing
that
was
running
round
the
edge
of
the
envelope
it
was
an
insect
full
six
inches
long
and
of
a
vivid
venomous
red
color
it
had
something
of
the
appearance
of
a
great
ant
with
its
long
quivering
antennae
and
its
febrile
horrible
vitality
but
it
was
proportionately
longer
of
body
and
smaller
of
head
and
had
numberless
rapidly
moving
legs
in
short
it
was
a
giant
centipede
apparently
of
the
scolopendra
group
but
of
a
form
quite
new
to
me
these
things
i
realized
in
one
breathless
instant
in
the
next
smith
had
dashed
the
thing
poisonous
life
out
with
one
straight
true
blow
of
the
golf
club
i
leaped
to
the
window
and
threw
it
widely
open
feeling
a
silk
thread
brush
my
hand
as
i
did
so
a
black
shape
was
dropping
with
incredible
agility
from
branch
to
branch
of
the
ivy
and
without
once
offering
a
mark
for
a
it
merged
into
the
shadows
beneath
the
trees
of
the
garden
as
i
turned
and
switched
on
the
light
nayland
smith
dropped
limply
into
a
chair
leaning
his
head
upon
his
hands
even
that
grim
courage
had
been
tried
sorely
never
mind
the
dacoit
petrie
he
said
nemesis
will
know
where
to
find
him
we
know
now
what
causes
the
mark
of
the
zayat
kiss
therefore
science
is
richer
for
our
first
brush
with
the
enemy
and
the
enemy
is
poorer
unless
he
has
any
more
unclassified
centipedes
i
understand
now
something
that
has
been
puzzling
me
since
i
heard
of
it
sir
crichton
stifled
cry
when
we
remember
that
he
was
almost
past
speech
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
his
cry
was
not
red
hand
but
red
ant
petrie
to
think
that
i
failed
by
less
than
an
hour
to
save
him
from
such
an
end
chapter
iv
the
body
of
a
lascar
dressed
in
the
manner
usual
on
the
boats
was
recovered
from
the
thames
off
tilbury
by
the
river
police
at
six
this
morning
it
is
supposed
that
the
man
met
with
an
accident
in
leaving
his
ship
nayland
smith
passed
me
the
evening
paper
and
pointed
to
the
above
paragraph
for
read
he
said
our
visitor
who
came
by
way
of
the
ivy
fortunately
for
us
failed
to
follow
his
instructions
also
he
lost
the
centipede
and
left
a
clew
behind
him
does
not
overlook
such
lapses
it
was
a
sidelight
upon
the
character
of
the
awful
being
with
whom
we
had
to
deal
my
very
soul
recoiled
from
bare
consideration
of
the
fate
that
would
be
ours
if
ever
we
fell
into
his
hands
the
telephone
bell
rang
i
went
out
and
found
that
inspector
weymouth
of
new
scotland
yard
had
called
us
up
will
nayland
smith
please
come
to
the
wapping
river
police
station
at
once
was
the
message
peaceful
interludes
were
few
enough
throughout
that
wild
pursuit
it
is
certainly
something
important
said
my
friend
and
if
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
as
we
must
presume
him
to
be
probably
something
ghastly
a
brief
survey
of
the
showed
us
that
there
were
no
trains
to
serve
our
haste
we
accordingly
chartered
a
cab
and
proceeded
east
smith
throughout
the
journey
talked
entertainingly
about
his
work
in
burma
of
intent
i
think
he
avoided
any
reference
to
the
circumstances
which
first
had
brought
him
in
contact
with
the
sinister
genius
of
the
yellow
movement
his
talk
was
rather
of
the
sunshine
of
the
east
than
of
its
shadows
but
the
drive
concluded
and
all
too
soon
in
a
silence
which
neither
of
us
seemed
disposed
to
break
we
entered
the
police
depot
and
followed
an
officer
who
received
us
into
the
room
where
weymouth
waited
the
inspector
greeted
us
briefly
nodding
toward
the
table
poor
cadby
the
most
promising
lad
at
the
yard
he
said
and
his
usually
gruff
voice
had
softened
strangely
smith
struck
his
right
fist
into
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
and
swore
under
his
breath
striding
up
and
down
the
neat
little
room
no
one
spoke
for
a
moment
and
in
the
silence
i
could
hear
the
whispering
of
the
thames
outside
of
the
thames
which
had
so
many
strange
secrets
to
tell
and
now
was
burdened
with
another
the
body
lay
prone
upon
the
deal
table
this
latest
of
the
dead
dressed
in
rough
sailor
garb
and
to
all
outward
seeming
a
seaman
of
nondescript
nationality
such
as
is
no
stranger
in
wapping
and
shadwell
his
dark
curly
hair
clung
clammily
about
the
brown
forehead
his
skin
was
stained
they
told
me
he
wore
a
gold
ring
in
one
ear
and
three
fingers
of
the
left
hand
were
missing
it
was
almost
the
same
with
mason
the
river
police
inspector
was
speaking
a
week
ago
on
a
wednesday
he
went
off
in
his
own
time
on
some
funny
business
down
george
way
and
thursday
night
the
boat
got
the
grapnel
on
him
off
hanover
hole
his
first
two
fingers
on
the
right
hand
were
clean
gone
and
his
left
hand
was
mutilated
frightfully
he
paused
and
glanced
at
smith
that
lascar
too
he
continued
that
you
came
down
to
see
sir
you
remember
his
hands
smith
nodded
he
was
not
a
lascar
he
said
shortly
he
was
a
dacoit
silence
fell
again
i
turned
to
the
array
of
objects
lying
on
the
table
those
which
had
been
found
in
cadby
clothing
none
of
them
were
noteworthy
except
that
which
had
been
found
thrust
into
the
loose
neck
of
his
shirt
this
last
it
was
which
had
led
the
police
to
send
for
nayland
smith
for
it
constituted
the
first
clew
which
had
come
to
light
pointing
to
the
authors
of
these
mysterious
tragedies
it
was
a
chinese
pigtail
that
alone
was
sufficiently
remarkable
but
it
was
rendered
more
so
by
the
fact
that
the
plaited
queue
was
a
false
one
being
attached
to
a
most
ingenious
bald
wig
you
sure
it
was
part
of
a
chinese
questioned
weymouth
his
eye
on
the
strange
relic
cadby
was
clever
at
disguise
smith
snatched
the
wig
from
my
hands
with
a
certain
irritation
and
tried
to
fit
it
on
the
dead
detective
too
small
by
inches
he
jerked
and
look
how
it
padded
in
the
crown
this
thing
was
made
for
a
most
abnormal
head
he
threw
it
down
and
fell
to
pacing
the
room
again
where
did
you
find
him
exactly
he
asked
limehouse
reach
under
commercial
dock
pier
exactly
an
hour
ago
and
you
last
saw
him
at
eight
last
night
to
weymouth
eight
to
a
quarter
past
you
think
he
has
been
dead
nearly
hours
petrie
roughly
hours
i
replied
then
we
know
that
he
was
on
the
track
of
the
group
that
he
followed
up
some
clew
which
led
him
to
the
neighborhood
of
old
ratcliff
highway
and
that
he
died
the
same
night
you
are
sure
that
is
where
he
was
going
yes
said
weymouth
he
was
jealous
of
giving
anything
away
poor
chap
it
meant
a
big
lift
for
him
if
he
pulled
the
case
off
but
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
expected
to
spend
last
night
in
that
district
he
left
the
yard
about
eight
as
i
said
to
go
to
his
rooms
and
dress
for
the
job
did
he
keep
any
record
of
his
cases
of
course
he
was
most
particular
cadby
was
a
man
with
ambitions
sir
you
want
to
see
his
book
wait
while
i
get
his
address
somewhere
in
brixton
he
went
to
the
telephone
and
inspector
ryman
covered
up
the
dead
face
nayland
smith
was
palpably
excited
he
almost
succeeded
where
we
have
failed
petrie
he
said
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
he
was
hot
on
the
track
of
poor
mason
had
probably
blundered
on
the
scent
too
and
he
met
with
a
similar
fate
without
other
evidence
the
fact
that
they
both
died
in
the
same
way
as
the
dacoit
would
be
conclusive
for
we
know
that
killed
the
dacoit
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
mutilated
hands
smith
god
knows
cadby
death
was
from
drowning
you
say
there
are
no
other
marks
of
violence
but
he
was
a
very
strong
swimmer
doctor
interrupted
inspector
ryman
why
he
pulled
off
the
championship
at
the
crystal
palace
last
year
cadby
was
a
man
easy
to
drown
and
as
for
mason
he
was
an
and
like
a
fish
in
the
water
smith
shrugged
his
shoulders
helplessly
let
us
hope
that
one
day
we
shall
know
how
they
died
he
said
simply
weymouth
returned
from
the
telephone
the
address
is
cold
harbor
lane
he
reported
i
shall
not
be
able
to
come
along
but
you
ca
miss
it
it
close
by
the
brixton
police
station
there
no
family
fortunately
he
was
quite
alone
in
the
world
his
is
in
the
american
desk
which
you
find
in
his
it
in
the
cupboard
in
the
corner
top
shelf
here
are
his
keys
all
intact
i
think
this
is
the
cupboard
key
smith
nodded
come
on
petrie
he
said
we
have
a
second
to
waste
our
cab
was
waiting
and
in
a
few
seconds
we
were
speeding
along
wapping
high
street
we
had
gone
no
more
than
a
few
hundred
yards
i
think
when
smith
suddenly
slapped
his
open
hand
down
on
his
knee
that
pigtail
he
cried
i
have
left
it
behind
we
must
have
it
petrie
stop
stop
the
cab
was
pulled
up
and
smith
alighted
do
wait
for
me
he
directed
hurriedly
here
take
card
remember
where
he
said
the
book
was
it
all
we
want
come
straight
on
to
scotland
yard
and
meet
me
there
but
smith
i
protested
a
few
minutes
can
make
no
difference
ca
it
he
snapped
do
you
suppose
is
going
to
leave
evidence
like
that
lying
about
it
a
thousand
to
one
he
has
it
already
but
there
is
just
a
bare
chance
it
was
a
new
aspect
of
the
situation
and
one
that
afforded
no
room
for
comment
and
so
lost
in
thought
did
i
become
that
the
cab
was
outside
the
house
for
which
i
was
bound
ere
i
realized
that
we
had
quitted
the
purlieus
of
wapping
yet
i
had
had
leisure
to
review
the
whole
troop
of
events
which
had
crowded
my
life
since
the
return
of
nayland
smith
from
burma
mentally
i
had
looked
again
upon
the
dead
sir
crichton
davey
and
with
smith
had
waited
in
the
dark
for
the
dreadful
thing
that
had
killed
him
now
with
those
remorseless
memories
jostling
in
my
mind
i
was
entering
the
house
of
last
victim
and
the
shadow
of
that
giant
evil
seemed
to
be
upon
it
like
a
palpable
cloud
cadby
old
landlady
greeted
me
with
a
queer
mixture
of
fear
and
embarrassment
in
her
manner
i
am
petrie
i
said
and
i
regret
that
i
bring
bad
news
respecting
mr
cadby
oh
sir
she
cried
do
tell
me
that
anything
has
happened
to
him
and
divining
something
of
the
mission
on
which
i
was
come
for
such
sad
duty
often
falls
to
the
lot
of
the
medical
man
oh
the
poor
brave
lad
indeed
i
respected
the
dead
man
memory
more
than
ever
from
that
hour
since
the
sorrow
of
the
worthy
old
soul
was
quite
pathetic
and
spoke
eloquently
for
the
unhappy
cause
of
it
there
was
a
terrible
wailing
at
the
back
of
the
house
last
night
doctor
and
i
heard
it
again
a
second
before
you
knocked
poor
lad
it
was
the
same
when
his
mother
died
at
the
moment
i
paid
little
attention
to
her
words
for
such
beliefs
are
common
unfortunately
but
when
she
was
sufficiently
composed
i
went
on
to
explain
what
i
thought
necessary
and
now
the
old
embarrassment
took
precedence
of
her
sorrow
and
presently
the
truth
came
out
there
a
young
lady
in
his
rooms
sir
i
started
this
might
mean
little
or
might
mean
much
she
came
and
waited
for
him
last
night
doctor
from
ten
until
and
this
morning
again
she
came
the
third
time
about
an
hour
ago
and
has
been
upstairs
since
do
you
know
her
mrs
dolan
dolan
grew
embarrassed
again
well
doctor
she
said
wiping
her
eyes
the
while
i
do
and
god
knows
he
was
a
good
lad
and
i
like
a
mother
to
him
but
she
is
not
the
girl
i
should
have
liked
a
son
of
mine
to
take
up
with
at
any
other
time
this
would
have
been
amusing
now
it
might
be
serious
dolan
account
of
the
wailing
became
suddenly
significant
for
perhaps
it
meant
that
one
of
dacoit
followers
was
watching
the
house
to
give
warning
of
any
approach
warning
to
whom
it
was
unlikely
that
i
should
forget
the
dark
eyes
of
another
of
servants
was
that
lure
of
men
even
now
in
the
house
completing
her
evil
work
i
should
never
have
allowed
her
in
his
rooms
began
dolan
again
then
there
was
an
interruption
a
soft
rustling
reached
my
ears
intimately
feminine
the
girl
was
stealing
down
i
leaped
out
into
the
hall
and
she
turned
and
fled
blindly
before
me
back
up
the
stairs
taking
three
steps
at
a
time
i
followed
her
bounded
into
the
room
above
almost
at
her
heels
and
stood
with
my
back
to
the
door
she
cowered
against
the
desk
by
the
window
a
slim
figure
in
a
clinging
silk
gown
which
alone
explained
dolan
distrust
the
gaslight
was
turned
very
low
and
her
hat
shadowed
her
face
but
could
not
hide
its
startling
beauty
could
not
mar
the
brilliancy
of
the
skin
nor
dim
the
wonderful
eyes
of
this
modern
delilah
for
it
was
she
so
i
came
in
time
i
said
grimly
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
oh
she
panted
at
that
and
stood
facing
me
leaning
back
with
her
hands
clutching
the
desk
edge
give
me
whatever
you
have
removed
from
here
i
said
sternly
and
then
prepare
to
accompany
me
she
took
a
step
forward
her
eyes
wide
with
fear
her
lips
parted
i
have
taken
nothing
she
said
her
breast
was
heaving
tumultuously
oh
let
me
go
please
let
me
go
and
impulsively
she
threw
herself
forward
pressing
clasped
hands
against
my
shoulder
and
looking
up
into
my
face
with
passionate
pleading
eyes
it
is
with
some
shame
that
i
confess
how
her
charm
enveloped
me
like
a
magic
cloud
unfamiliar
with
the
complex
oriental
temperament
i
had
laughed
at
nayland
smith
when
he
had
spoken
of
this
girl
infatuation
love
in
the
east
he
had
said
is
like
the
conjurer
it
is
born
grows
and
flowers
at
the
touch
of
a
hand
now
in
those
pleading
eyes
i
read
confirmation
of
his
words
her
clothes
or
her
hair
exhaled
a
faint
perfume
like
all
servants
she
was
perfectly
chosen
for
her
peculiar
duties
her
beauty
was
wholly
intoxicating
but
i
thrust
her
away
you
have
no
claim
to
mercy
i
said
do
not
count
upon
any
what
have
you
taken
from
here
she
grasped
the
lapels
of
my
coat
i
will
tell
you
all
i
can
all
i
dare
she
panted
eagerly
fearfully
i
should
know
how
to
deal
with
your
friend
but
with
you
i
am
lost
if
you
could
only
understand
you
would
not
be
so
cruel
her
slight
accent
added
charm
to
the
musical
voice
i
am
not
free
as
your
english
women
are
what
i
do
i
must
do
for
it
is
the
will
of
my
master
and
i
am
only
a
slave
ah
you
are
not
a
man
if
you
can
give
me
to
the
police
you
have
no
heart
if
you
can
forget
that
i
tried
to
save
you
once
i
had
feared
that
plea
for
in
her
own
oriental
fashion
she
certainly
had
tried
to
save
me
from
a
deadly
peril
once
at
the
expense
of
my
friend
but
i
had
feared
the
plea
for
i
did
not
know
how
to
meet
it
how
could
i
give
her
up
perhaps
to
stand
her
trial
for
murder
and
now
i
fell
silent
and
she
saw
why
i
was
silent
i
may
deserve
no
mercy
i
may
be
even
as
bad
as
you
think
but
what
have
you
to
do
with
the
police
it
is
not
your
work
to
hound
a
woman
to
death
could
you
ever
look
another
woman
in
the
eyes
one
that
you
loved
and
know
that
she
trusted
you
if
you
had
done
such
a
thing
ah
i
have
no
friend
in
all
the
world
or
i
should
not
be
here
do
not
be
my
enemy
my
judge
and
make
me
worse
than
i
am
be
my
friend
and
save
me
from
him
the
tremulous
lips
were
close
to
mine
her
breath
fanned
my
cheek
have
mercy
on
me
at
that
moment
i
honestly
would
have
given
half
of
my
worldly
possessions
to
have
been
spared
the
decision
which
i
knew
i
must
come
to
after
all
what
proof
had
i
that
she
was
a
willing
accomplice
of
furthermore
she
was
an
oriental
and
her
code
must
necessarily
be
different
from
mine
irreconcilable
as
the
thing
may
be
with
western
ideas
nayland
smith
had
really
told
me
that
he
believed
the
girl
to
be
a
slave
then
there
remained
that
other
reason
why
i
loathed
the
idea
of
becoming
her
captor
it
was
almost
tantamount
to
betrayal
must
i
soil
my
hands
with
such
work
thus
i
suppose
her
seductive
beauty
argued
against
my
sense
of
right
the
jeweled
fingers
grasped
my
shoulders
nervously
and
her
slim
body
quivered
against
mine
as
she
watched
me
with
all
her
soul
in
her
eyes
in
an
abandonment
of
pleading
despair
then
i
remembered
the
fate
of
the
man
in
whose
room
we
stood
you
lured
cadby
to
his
death
i
said
and
shook
her
off
no
no
she
cried
wildly
clutching
at
me
no
i
swear
by
the
holy
name
i
did
not
i
did
not
i
watched
him
spied
upon
him
yes
but
listen
it
was
because
he
would
not
be
warned
that
he
met
his
death
i
could
not
save
him
ah
i
am
not
so
bad
as
that
i
will
tell
you
i
have
taken
his
notebook
and
torn
out
the
last
pages
and
burnt
them
look
in
the
grate
the
book
was
too
big
to
steal
away
i
came
twice
and
could
not
find
it
there
will
you
let
me
go
if
you
will
tell
me
where
and
how
to
seize
dr
yes
her
hands
dropped
and
she
took
a
backward
step
a
new
terror
was
to
be
read
in
her
face
i
dare
not
i
dare
not
then
you
would
if
you
dared
she
was
watching
me
intently
not
if
you
would
go
to
find
him
she
said
and
with
all
that
i
thought
her
to
be
the
stern
servant
of
justice
that
i
would
have
had
myself
i
felt
the
hot
blood
leap
to
my
cheek
at
all
which
the
words
implied
she
grasped
my
arm
could
you
hide
me
from
him
if
i
came
to
you
and
told
you
all
i
know
the
authorities
ah
her
expression
changed
they
can
put
me
on
the
rack
if
they
choose
but
never
one
word
would
i
speak
never
one
little
word
she
threw
up
her
head
scornfully
then
the
proud
glance
softened
again
but
i
will
speak
for
you
closer
she
came
and
closer
until
she
could
whisper
in
my
ear
hide
me
from
your
police
from
him
from
everybody
and
i
will
no
longer
be
his
slave
my
heart
was
beating
with
painful
rapidity
i
had
not
counted
on
this
warring
with
a
woman
moreover
it
was
harder
than
i
could
have
dreamt
of
for
some
time
i
had
been
aware
that
by
the
charm
of
her
personality
and
the
art
of
her
pleading
she
had
brought
me
down
from
my
judgment
seat
had
made
it
all
but
impossible
for
me
to
give
her
up
to
justice
now
i
was
disarmed
but
in
a
quandary
what
should
i
do
what
could
i
do
i
turned
away
from
her
and
walked
to
the
hearth
in
which
some
paper
ash
lay
and
yet
emitted
a
faint
smell
not
more
than
ten
seconds
elapsed
i
am
confident
from
the
time
that
i
stepped
across
the
room
until
i
glanced
back
but
she
had
gone
as
i
leapt
to
the
door
the
key
turned
gently
from
the
outside
ma
came
her
soft
whisper
but
i
am
afraid
to
trust
you
yet
be
comforted
for
there
is
one
near
who
would
have
killed
you
had
i
wished
it
remember
i
will
come
to
you
whenever
you
will
take
me
and
hide
me
light
footsteps
pattered
down
the
stairs
i
heard
a
stifled
cry
from
dolan
as
the
mysterious
visitor
ran
past
her
the
front
door
opened
and
closed
chapter
v
is
a
in
one
of
the
burrows
off
the
old
ratcliff
highway
said
inspector
weymouth
charlie
they
call
it
it
a
center
for
some
of
the
chinese
societies
i
believe
but
all
sorts
of
use
it
there
have
never
been
any
complaints
that
i
know
of
i
understand
this
we
stood
in
his
room
at
new
scotland
yard
bending
over
a
sheet
of
foolscap
upon
which
were
arranged
some
burned
fragments
from
poor
cadby
grate
for
so
hurriedly
had
the
girl
done
her
work
that
combustion
had
not
been
complete
what
do
we
make
of
this
said
smith
hunchback
lascar
went
up
unlike
others
not
return
till
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
name
i
think
me
out
booming
sound
lascar
in
mortuary
i
could
ident
not
for
days
or
suspici
tuesday
night
in
a
different
make
snatch
pigtail
the
pigtail
again
rapped
weymouth
she
evidently
burned
the
pages
all
together
continued
smith
they
lay
flat
and
this
was
in
the
middle
i
see
the
hand
of
retributive
justice
in
that
inspector
now
we
have
a
reference
to
a
hunchback
and
what
follows
amounts
to
this
a
lascar
amongst
several
other
persons
went
up
somewhere
presumably
upstairs
at
and
did
not
come
down
again
cadby
who
was
there
disguised
noted
a
booming
sound
later
he
identified
the
lascar
in
some
mortuary
we
have
no
means
of
fixing
the
date
of
this
visit
to
but
i
feel
inclined
to
put
down
the
as
the
dacoit
who
was
murdered
by
it
is
sheer
supposition
however
but
that
cadby
meant
to
pay
another
visit
to
the
place
in
a
different
or
disguise
is
evident
and
that
the
tuesday
night
proposed
was
last
night
is
a
reasonable
deduction
the
reference
to
a
pigtail
is
principally
interesting
because
of
what
was
found
on
cadby
body
inspector
weymouth
nodded
affirmatively
and
smith
glanced
at
his
watch
exactly
he
said
i
will
trouble
you
inspector
for
the
freedom
of
your
fancy
wardrobe
there
is
time
to
spend
an
hour
in
the
company
of
opium
friends
weymouth
raised
his
eyebrows
it
might
be
risky
what
about
an
official
visit
nayland
smith
laughed
worse
than
useless
by
your
own
showing
the
place
is
open
to
inspection
no
guile
against
guile
we
are
dealing
with
a
chinaman
with
the
incarnate
essence
of
eastern
subtlety
with
the
most
stupendous
genius
that
the
modern
orient
has
produced
i
do
believe
in
disguises
said
weymouth
with
a
certain
truculence
it
mostly
played
out
that
game
and
generally
leads
to
failure
still
if
you
determined
sir
there
an
end
of
it
foster
will
make
your
face
up
what
disguise
do
you
propose
to
adopt
a
sort
of
dago
seaman
i
think
something
like
poor
cadby
i
can
rely
on
my
knowledge
of
the
brutes
if
i
am
sure
of
my
disguise
you
are
forgetting
me
smith
i
said
he
turned
to
me
quickly
petrie
he
replied
it
is
my
business
unfortunately
but
it
is
no
sort
of
hobby
you
mean
that
you
can
no
longer
rely
upon
me
i
said
angrily
smith
grasped
my
hand
and
met
my
rather
frigid
stare
with
a
look
of
real
concern
on
his
gaunt
bronzed
face
my
dear
old
chap
he
answered
that
was
really
unkind
you
know
that
i
meant
something
totally
different
it
all
right
smith
i
said
immediately
ashamed
of
my
choler
and
wrung
his
hand
heartily
i
can
pretend
to
smoke
opium
as
well
as
another
i
shall
be
going
too
inspector
as
a
result
of
this
little
passage
of
words
some
twenty
minutes
later
two
seafaring
ruffians
entered
a
waiting
cab
accompanied
by
inspector
weymouth
and
were
driven
off
into
the
wilderness
of
london
night
in
this
theatrical
business
there
was
to
my
mind
something
ridiculous
almost
childish
and
i
could
have
laughed
heartily
had
it
not
been
that
grim
tragedy
lurked
so
near
to
farce
the
mere
recollection
that
somewhere
at
our
journey
end
awaited
us
was
sufficient
to
sober
my
reflections
who
with
all
the
powers
represented
by
nayland
smith
pitted
against
him
pursued
his
dark
schemes
triumphantly
and
lurked
in
hiding
within
this
very
area
which
was
so
sedulously
patrolled
whom
i
had
never
seen
but
whose
name
stood
for
horrors
indefinable
perhaps
i
was
destined
to
meet
the
terrible
chinese
doctor
i
ceased
to
pursue
a
train
of
thought
which
promised
to
lead
to
morbid
depths
and
directed
my
attention
to
what
smith
was
saying
we
will
drop
down
from
wapping
and
reconnoiter
as
you
say
the
place
is
close
to
the
riverside
then
you
can
put
us
ashore
somewhere
below
ryman
can
keep
the
launch
close
to
the
back
of
the
premises
and
your
fellows
will
be
hanging
about
near
the
front
near
enough
to
hear
the
whistle
yes
assented
weymouth
i
arranged
for
that
if
you
are
suspected
you
shall
give
the
alarm
i
do
know
said
smith
thoughtfully
even
in
that
event
i
might
wait
awhile
do
wait
too
long
advised
the
inspector
we
should
be
much
wiser
if
your
next
appearance
was
on
the
end
of
a
grapnel
somewhere
down
greenwich
reach
with
half
your
fingers
missing
the
cab
pulled
up
outside
the
river
police
depot
and
smith
and
i
entered
without
delay
four
fellows
who
had
been
seated
in
the
office
springing
up
to
salute
the
inspector
who
followed
us
in
guthrie
and
lisle
he
said
briskly
get
along
and
find
a
dark
corner
which
commands
the
door
of
singapore
charlie
off
the
old
highway
you
look
the
dirtiest
of
the
troupe
guthrie
you
might
drop
asleep
on
the
pavement
and
lisle
can
argue
with
you
about
getting
home
move
till
you
hear
the
whistle
inside
or
have
my
orders
and
note
everybody
that
goes
in
and
comes
out
you
other
two
belong
to
this
division
the
men
having
departed
the
remaining
pair
saluted
again
well
you
on
special
duty
you
been
prompt
but
stick
your
chests
out
so
much
do
you
know
of
a
back
way
to
the
men
looked
at
one
another
and
both
shook
their
heads
there
an
empty
shop
nearly
opposite
sir
replied
one
of
them
i
know
a
broken
window
at
the
back
where
we
could
climb
in
then
we
could
get
through
to
the
front
and
watch
from
there
good
cried
the
inspector
see
you
are
not
spotted
though
and
if
you
hear
the
whistle
do
mind
doing
a
bit
of
damage
but
be
inside
like
lightning
otherwise
wait
for
orders
inspector
ryman
came
in
glancing
at
the
clock
launch
is
waiting
he
said
right
replied
smith
thoughtfully
i
am
half
afraid
though
that
the
recent
alarms
may
have
scared
our
quarry
your
man
mason
and
then
cadby
against
which
we
have
that
so
far
as
he
is
likely
to
know
there
has
been
no
clew
pointing
to
this
opium
den
remember
he
thinks
cadby
notes
are
destroyed
the
whole
business
is
an
utter
mystery
to
me
confessed
ryman
told
that
there
some
dangerous
chinese
devil
hiding
somewhere
in
london
and
that
you
expect
to
find
him
at
supposing
he
uses
that
place
which
is
possible
how
do
you
know
he
there
i
do
said
smith
but
it
is
the
first
clew
we
have
had
pointing
to
one
of
his
haunts
and
time
means
precious
lives
where
is
concerned
who
is
he
sir
exactly
this
dr
i
have
only
the
vaguest
idea
inspector
but
he
is
no
ordinary
criminal
he
is
the
greatest
genius
which
the
powers
of
evil
have
put
on
earth
for
centuries
he
has
the
backing
of
a
political
group
whose
wealth
is
enormous
and
his
mission
in
europe
is
to
pave
the
way
do
you
follow
me
he
is
the
of
a
movement
so
that
not
one
britisher
and
not
one
american
in
fifty
thousand
has
ever
dreamed
of
it
ryman
stared
but
made
no
reply
and
we
went
out
passing
down
to
the
breakwater
and
boarding
the
waiting
launch
with
her
crew
of
three
the
party
numbered
seven
that
swung
out
into
the
pool
and
clearing
the
pier
drew
in
again
and
hugged
the
murky
shore
the
night
had
been
clear
enough
hitherto
but
now
came
scudding
rainbanks
to
curtain
the
crescent
moon
and
anon
to
unveil
her
again
and
show
the
muddy
swirls
about
us
the
view
was
not
extensive
from
the
launch
sometimes
a
deepening
of
the
near
shadows
would
tell
of
a
moored
barge
or
lights
high
above
our
heads
mark
the
deck
of
a
large
vessel
in
the
floods
of
moonlight
gaunt
shapes
towered
above
in
the
ensuing
darkness
only
the
oily
glitter
of
the
tide
occupied
the
foreground
of
the
the
surrey
shore
was
a
broken
wall
of
blackness
patched
with
lights
about
which
moved
hazy
suggestions
of
human
activity
the
bank
we
were
following
offered
a
prospect
even
more
gloomy
a
dense
dark
mass
amid
which
sometimes
mysterious
told
of
a
dock
gate
or
sudden
high
lights
leapt
flaring
to
the
eye
then
out
of
the
mystery
ahead
a
green
light
grew
and
crept
down
upon
us
a
giant
shape
loomed
up
and
frowned
crushingly
upon
the
little
craft
a
blaze
of
light
the
jangle
of
a
bell
and
it
was
past
we
were
dancing
in
the
wash
of
one
of
the
scotch
steamers
and
the
murk
had
fallen
again
discords
of
remote
activity
rose
above
the
more
intimate
throbbing
of
our
screw
and
we
seemed
a
pigmy
company
floating
past
the
workshops
of
brobdingnagian
toilers
the
chill
of
the
near
water
communicated
itself
to
me
and
i
felt
the
protection
of
my
shabby
garments
inadequate
against
it
far
over
on
the
surrey
shore
a
blue
light
vaporous
mysterious
flicked
translucent
tongues
against
the
night
curtain
it
was
a
weird
elusive
flame
leaping
wavering
magically
changing
from
blue
to
a
yellowed
violet
rising
falling
only
a
gasworks
came
smith
voice
and
i
knew
that
he
too
had
been
watching
those
elfin
fires
but
it
always
reminds
me
of
a
mexican
teocalli
and
the
altar
of
sacrifice
the
simile
was
apt
but
gruesome
i
thought
of
and
the
severed
fingers
and
could
not
repress
a
shudder
on
your
left
past
the
wooden
pier
not
where
the
lamp
is
beyond
that
next
to
the
dark
square
building
it
was
inspector
ryman
speaking
drop
us
somewhere
handy
then
replied
smith
and
lie
close
in
with
your
ears
wide
open
we
may
have
to
run
for
it
so
do
go
far
away
from
the
tone
of
his
voice
i
knew
that
the
night
mystery
of
the
thames
had
claimed
at
least
one
other
victim
dead
slow
came
ryman
order
we
put
in
to
the
stone
stairs
chapter
vi
a
seemingly
drunken
voice
was
droning
from
a
neighboring
alleyway
as
smith
lurched
in
hulking
fashion
to
the
door
of
a
little
shop
above
which
crudely
painted
were
the
words
barber
i
shuffled
along
behind
him
and
had
time
to
note
the
box
of
studs
german
shaving
tackle
and
rolls
of
twist
which
lay
untidily
in
the
window
ere
smith
kicked
the
door
open
clattered
down
three
wooden
steps
and
pulled
himself
up
with
a
jerk
seizing
my
arm
for
support
we
stood
in
a
bare
and
very
dirty
room
which
could
only
claim
kinship
with
a
civilized
by
virtue
of
the
grimy
towel
thrown
across
the
back
of
the
solitary
chair
a
yiddish
theatrical
bill
of
some
kind
illustrated
adorned
one
of
the
walls
and
another
bill
in
what
may
have
been
chinese
completed
the
decorations
from
behind
a
curtain
heavily
brocaded
with
filth
a
little
chinaman
appeared
dressed
in
a
loose
smock
black
trousers
and
slippers
and
advancing
shook
his
head
vigorously
no
shavee
no
shavee
he
chattered
simian
fashion
squinting
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
with
his
twinkling
eyes
too
late
shuttee
shop
do
you

smith
in
a
voice
of
amazing
gruffness
and
shook
an
artificially
dirtied
fist
under
the
nose
get
inside
and
gim
me

my

bent
forward
and
glared
into
the
other
eyes
with
a
vindictiveness
that
amazed
me
unfamiliar
as
i
was
with
this
form
of
gentle
persuasion

said
and
thrust
a
coin
into

the

smith
raised
his
fist
and
yan
capitulated
allee
lightee
he
said
full
up
no
loom
you
come
see
he
dived
behind
the
dirty
curtain
smith
and
i
following
and
ran
up
a
dark
stair
the
next
moment
i
found
myself
in
an
atmosphere
which
was
literally
poisonous
it
was
all
but
unbreathable
being
loaded
with
opium
fumes
never
before
had
i
experienced
anything
like
it
every
breath
was
an
effort
a
tin
on
a
box
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
dimly
illuminated
the
horrible
place
about
the
walls
of
which
ten
or
twelve
bunks
were
ranged
and
all
of
them
occupied
most
of
the
occupants
were
lying
motionless
but
one
or
two
were
squatting
in
their
bunks
noisily
sucking
at
the
little
metal
pipes
these
had
not
yet
attained
to
the
nirvana
no
loom
samee
tella
you
said
complacently
testing
shilling
with
his
yellow
decayed
teeth
smith
walked
to
a
corner
and
dropped
on
the
floor
pulling
me
down
with
him
two
pipe
quick
he
said
plenty
room
two
piecee
pipe
or
plenty
heap
trouble
a
dreary
voice
from
one
of
the
bunks
came
give
a
pipe
charlie
curse
yer
an
stop
palaver
yan
performed
a
curious
little
shrug
rather
of
the
back
than
of
the
shoulders
and
shuffled
to
the
box
which
bore
the
smoky
lamp
holding
a
needle
in
the
flame
he
dipped
it
when
into
an
old
cocoa
tin
and
withdrew
it
with
a
bead
of
opium
adhering
to
the
end
slowly
roasting
this
over
the
lamp
he
dropped
it
into
the
bowl
of
the
metal
pipe
which
he
held
ready
where
it
burned
with
a
spirituous
blue
flame
pass
it
over
said
smith
huskily
and
rose
on
his
knees
with
the
assumed
eagerness
of
a
slave
to
the
drug
yan
handed
him
the
pipe
which
he
promptly
put
to
his
lips
and
prepared
another
for
me
whatever
you
do
do
inhale
any
came
smith
whispered
injunction
it
was
with
a
sense
of
nausea
greater
even
than
that
occasioned
by
the
disgusting
atmosphere
of
the
den
that
i
took
the
pipe
and
pretended
to
smoke
taking
my
cue
from
my
friend
i
allowed
my
head
gradually
to
sink
lower
and
lower
until
within
a
few
minutes
i
sprawled
sideways
on
the
floor
smith
lying
close
beside
me
the
ship
sinkin
droned
a
voice
from
one
of
the
bunks
look
at
the
rats
yan
had
noiselessly
withdrawn
and
i
experienced
a
curious
sense
of
isolation
from
my
fellows
from
the
whole
of
the
western
world
my
throat
was
parched
with
the
fumes
my
head
ached
the
vicious
atmosphere
seemed
contaminating
i
was
as
one
dropped
somewhere
east
of
suez
where
the
best
is
like
the
worst
and
there
ai
no
ten
commandments
and
a
man
can
raise
a
thirst
smith
began
to
whisper
softly
we
have
carried
it
through
successfully
so
far
he
said
i
know
if
you
have
observed
it
but
there
is
a
stair
just
behind
you
half
concealed
by
a
ragged
curtain
we
are
near
that
and
well
in
the
dark
i
have
seen
nothing
suspicious
so
far
or
nothing
much
but
if
there
was
anything
going
forward
it
would
no
doubt
be
delayed
until
we
new
arrivals
were
well
doped
he
pressed
my
arm
to
emphasize
the
warning
through
my
eyes
i
perceived
a
shadowy
form
near
the
curtain
to
which
he
had
referred
i
lay
like
a
log
but
my
muscles
were
tensed
nervously
the
shadow
materialized
as
the
figure
moved
forward
into
the
room
with
a
curiously
lithe
movement
the
smoky
lamp
in
the
middle
of
the
place
afforded
scant
illumination
serving
only
to
indicate
sprawling
shapes
here
an
extended
hand
brown
or
yellow
there
a
sketchy
face
whilst
from
all
about
rose
obscene
sighings
and
murmurings
in
voices
an
uncanny
animal
chorus
it
was
like
a
glimpse
of
the
inferno
seen
by
some
chinese
dante
but
so
close
to
us
stood
the
newcomer
that
i
was
able
to
make
out
a
ghastly
parchment
face
with
small
oblique
eyes
and
a
misshapen
head
crowned
with
a
coiled
pigtail
surmounting
a
slight
hunched
body
there
was
something
unnatural
inhuman
about
that
masklike
face
and
something
repulsive
in
the
bent
shape
and
the
long
yellow
hands
clasped
one
upon
the
other
from
smith
account
in
no
way
resembled
this
crouching
apparition
with
the
countenance
and
lithe
movements
but
an
instinct
of
some
kind
told
me
that
we
were
on
the
right
scent
that
this
was
one
of
the
doctor
servants
how
i
came
to
that
conclusion
i
can
not
explain
but
with
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
was
a
member
of
the
formidable
murder
group
i
saw
the
yellow
man
creep
nearer
nearer
silently
bent
and
peering
he
was
watching
us
of
another
circumstance
i
became
aware
and
a
disquieting
circumstance
there
were
fewer
murmurings
and
sighings
from
the
surrounding
bunks
the
presence
of
the
crouching
figure
had
created
a
sudden
in
the
den
which
could
only
mean
that
some
of
the
supposed
had
merely
feigned
coma
and
the
approach
of
coma
nayland
smith
lay
like
a
dead
man
and
trusting
to
the
darkness
i
too
lay
prone
and
still
but
watched
the
evil
face
bending
lower
and
lower
until
it
came
within
a
few
inches
of
my
own
i
completely
closed
my
eyes
delicate
fingers
touched
my
right
eyelid
divining
what
was
coming
i
rolled
my
eyes
up
as
the
lid
was
adroitly
lifted
and
lowered
again
the
man
moved
away
i
had
saved
the
situation
and
noting
anew
the
hush
about
me
a
hush
in
which
i
fancied
many
pairs
of
ears
listened
i
was
glad
for
just
a
moment
i
realized
fully
how
with
the
place
watched
back
and
front
we
yet
were
cut
off
were
in
the
hands
of
far
easterns
to
some
extent
in
the
power
of
members
of
that
most
inscrutably
mysterious
race
the
chinese
good
whispered
smith
at
my
side
i
do
think
i
could
have
done
it
he
took
me
on
trust
after
that
my
god
what
an
awful
face
petrie
it
the
hunchback
of
cadby
notes
ah
i
thought
so
do
you
see
that
i
turned
my
eyes
round
as
far
as
was
possible
a
man
had
scrambled
down
from
one
of
the
bunks
and
was
following
the
bent
figure
across
the
room
they
passed
around
us
quietly
the
little
yellow
man
leading
with
his
curious
lithe
gait
and
the
other
an
impassive
chinaman
following
the
curtain
was
raised
and
i
heard
footsteps
receding
on
the
stairs
do
stir
whispered
smith
an
intense
excitement
was
clearly
upon
him
and
he
communicated
it
to
me
who
was
the
occupant
of
the
room
above
footsteps
on
the
stair
and
the
chinaman
reappeared
recrossed
the
floor
and
went
out
the
little
bent
man
went
over
to
another
bunk
this
time
leading
up
the
stair
one
who
looked
like
a
lascar
did
you
see
his
right
hand
whispered
smith
a
dacoit
they
come
here
to
report
and
to
take
orders
petrie
is
up
there
what
shall
we
do
softly
wait
then
we
must
try
to
rush
the
stairs
it
would
be
futile
to
bring
in
the
police
first
he
is
sure
to
have
some
other
exit
i
will
give
the
word
while
the
little
yellow
devil
is
down
here
you
are
nearer
and
will
have
to
go
first
but
if
the
hunchback
follows
i
can
then
deal
with
him
our
whispered
colloquy
was
interrupted
by
the
return
of
the
dacoit
who
recrossed
the
room
as
the
chinaman
had
done
and
immediately
took
his
departure
a
third
man
whom
smith
identified
as
a
malay
ascended
the
mysterious
stairs
descended
and
went
out
and
a
fourth
whose
nationality
it
was
impossible
to
determine
followed
then
as
the
softly
moving
usher
crossed
to
a
bunk
on
the
right
of
the
outer
door
up
you
go
petrie
cried
smith
for
further
delay
was
dangerous
and
further
dissimulation
useless
i
leaped
to
my
feet
snatching
my
revolver
from
the
pocket
of
the
rough
jacket
i
wore
i
bounded
to
the
stair
and
went
blundering
up
in
complete
darkness
a
chorus
of
brutish
cries
clamored
from
behind
with
a
muffled
scream
rising
above
them
all
but
nayland
smith
was
close
behind
as
i
raced
along
a
covered
gangway
in
a
purer
air
and
at
my
heels
when
i
crashed
open
a
door
at
the
end
and
almost
fell
into
the
room
beyond
what
i
saw
were
merely
a
dirty
table
with
some
odds
and
ends
upon
it
of
which
i
was
too
excited
to
take
note
an
swung
by
a
brass
chain
above
and
a
man
sitting
behind
the
table
but
from
the
moment
that
my
gaze
rested
upon
the
one
who
sat
there
i
think
if
the
place
had
been
an
aladdin
palace
i
should
have
had
no
eyes
for
any
of
its
wonders
he
wore
a
plain
yellow
robe
of
a
hue
almost
identical
with
that
of
his
smooth
hairless
countenance
his
hands
were
large
long
and
bony
and
he
held
them
knuckles
upward
and
rested
his
pointed
chin
upon
their
thinness
he
had
a
great
high
brow
crowned
with
sparse
hair
of
his
face
as
it
looked
out
at
me
over
the
dirty
table
i
despair
of
writing
convincingly
it
was
that
of
an
archangel
of
evil
and
it
was
wholly
dominated
by
the
most
uncanny
eyes
that
ever
reflected
a
human
soul
for
they
were
narrow
and
long
very
slightly
oblique
and
of
a
brilliant
green
but
their
unique
horror
lay
in
a
certain
filminess
it
made
me
think
of
the
membrana
nictitans
in
a
bird
which
obscuring
them
as
i
threw
wide
the
door
seemed
to
lift
as
i
actually
passed
the
threshold
revealing
the
eyes
in
all
their
brilliant
iridescence
i
know
that
i
stopped
dead
one
foot
within
the
room
for
the
malignant
force
of
the
man
was
something
surpassing
my
experience
he
was
surprised
by
this
sudden
intrusion
yes
but
no
trace
of
fear
showed
upon
that
wonderful
face
only
a
sort
of
pitying
contempt
and
as
i
paused
he
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
never
removing
his
gaze
from
mine
it
cried
smith
over
my
shoulder
in
a
voice
that
was
almost
a
scream
it
cover
him
shoot
him
dead
if
the
conclusion
of
that
sentence
i
never
heard
reached
down
beside
the
table
and
the
floor
slipped
from
under
me
one
last
glimpse
i
had
of
the
fixed
green
eyes
and
with
a
scream
i
was
unable
to
repress
i
dropped
dropped
dropped
and
plunged
into
icy
water
which
closed
over
my
head
vaguely
i
had
seen
a
spurt
of
flame
had
heard
another
cry
following
my
own
a
booming
sound
the
trap
the
flat
note
of
a
police
whistle
but
when
i
rose
to
the
surface
impenetrable
darkness
enveloped
me
i
was
spitting
filthy
oily
liquid
from
my
mouth
and
fighting
down
the
black
terror
that
had
me
by
the
throat
terror
of
the
darkness
about
me
of
the
unknown
depths
beneath
me
of
the
pit
into
which
i
was
cast
amid
stifling
stenches
and
the
lapping
of
tidal
water
smith
i
cried
help
help
my
voice
seemed
to
beat
back
upon
me
yet
i
was
about
to
cry
out
again
when
mustering
all
my
presence
of
mind
and
all
my
failing
courage
i
recognized
that
i
had
better
employment
of
my
energies
and
began
to
swim
straight
ahead
desperately
determined
to
face
all
the
horrors
of
this
place
to
die
hard
if
die
i
must
a
drop
of
liquid
fire
fell
through
the
darkness
and
hissed
into
the
water
beside
me
i
felt
that
despite
my
resolution
i
was
going
mad
another
fiery
drop
and
another
i
touched
a
rotting
wooden
post
and
slimy
timbers
i
had
reached
one
bound
of
my
watery
prison
more
fire
fell
from
above
and
the
scream
of
hysteria
quivered
unuttered
in
my
throat
keeping
myself
afloat
with
increasing
difficulty
in
my
heavy
garments
i
threw
my
head
back
and
raised
my
eyes
no
more
drops
fell
and
no
more
drops
would
fall
but
it
was
merely
a
question
of
time
for
the
floor
to
collapse
for
it
was
beginning
to
emit
a
dull
red
glow
the
room
above
me
was
in
flames
it
was
drops
of
burning
oil
from
the
lamp
finding
passage
through
the
cracks
in
the
crazy
flooring
which
had
fallen
about
me
for
the
death
trap
had
reclosed
i
suppose
mechanically
my
saturated
garments
were
dragging
me
down
and
now
i
could
hear
the
flames
hungrily
eating
into
the
ancient
rottenness
overhead
shortly
that
cauldron
would
be
loosed
upon
my
head
the
glow
of
the
flames
grew
brighter
and
showed
me
the
piles
upholding
the
building
showed
me
the
tidal
mark
upon
the
walls
showed
me
that
there
was
no
escape
by
some
subterranean
duct
the
foul
place
was
fed
from
the
thames
by
that
duct
with
the
outgoing
tide
my
body
would
pass
in
the
wake
of
mason
cadby
and
many
another
victim
rusty
iron
rungs
were
affixed
to
one
of
the
walls
communicating
with
a
trap
but
the
bottom
three
were
missing
brighter
and
brighter
grew
the
awesome
light
the
light
of
what
should
be
my
funeral
pyre
reddening
the
oily
water
and
adding
a
new
dread
to
the
whispering
clammy
horror
of
the
pit
but
something
it
showed
me
a
projecting
beam
a
few
feet
above
the
water
and
directly
below
the
iron
ladder
merciful
heaven
i
breathed
have
i
the
strength
a
desire
for
laughter
claimed
me
with
sudden
all
but
irresistible
force
i
knew
what
it
portended
and
fought
it
down
grimly
sternly
my
garments
weighed
upon
me
like
a
suit
of
mail
with
my
chest
aching
dully
my
veins
throbbing
to
bursting
i
forced
tired
muscles
to
work
and
every
stroke
an
agony
approached
the
beam
nearer
i
swam
nearer
its
shadow
fell
black
upon
the
water
which
now
had
all
the
seeming
of
a
pool
of
blood
confused
sounds
a
remote
uproar
came
to
my
ears
i
was
nearly
spent
i
was
in
the
shadow
of
the
beam
if
i
could
throw
up
one
arm
a
shrill
scream
sounded
far
above
me
petrie
petrie
that
voice
must
be
smith
do
touch
the
beam
for
god
sake
do
touch
the
beam
keep
afloat
another
few
seconds
and
i
can
get
to
you
another
few
seconds
was
that
possible
i
managed
to
turn
to
raise
my
throbbing
head
and
i
saw
the
strangest
sight
which
that
night
yet
had
offered
nayland
smith
stood
upon
the
lowest
iron
rung
supported
by
the
hideous
chinaman
who
stood
upon
the
rung
above
i
ca
reach
him
it
was
as
smith
hissed
the
words
despairingly
that
i
looked
up
and
saw
the
chinaman
snatch
at
his
coiled
pigtail
and
pull
it
off
with
it
came
the
wig
to
which
it
was
attached
and
the
ghastly
yellow
mask
deprived
of
its
fastenings
fell
from
position
here
here
be
quick
oh
be
quick
you
can
lower
this
to
him
be
quick
be
quick
a
cloud
of
hair
came
falling
about
the
slim
shoulders
as
the
speaker
bent
to
pass
this
strange
lifeline
to
smith
and
i
think
it
was
my
wonder
at
knowing
her
for
the
girl
whom
that
day
i
had
surprised
in
cadby
rooms
which
saved
my
life
for
i
not
only
kept
afloat
but
kept
my
gaze
upturned
to
that
beautiful
flushed
face
and
my
eyes
fixed
upon
hers
which
were
wild
with
fear
for
me
smith
by
some
contortion
got
the
false
queue
into
my
grasp
and
i
with
the
strength
of
desperation
by
that
means
seized
hold
upon
the
lowest
rung
with
my
friend
arm
round
me
i
realized
that
exhaustion
was
even
nearer
than
i
had
supposed
my
last
distinct
memory
is
of
the
bursting
of
the
floor
above
and
the
big
burning
joist
hissing
into
the
pool
beneath
us
its
fiery
passage
striated
with
light
disclosed
two
sword
blades
riveted
edges
up
along
the
top
of
the
beam
which
i
had
striven
to
reach
the
severed
fingers
i
said
and
swooned
how
smith
got
me
through
the
trap
i
do
not
know
nor
how
we
made
our
way
through
the
smoke
and
flames
of
the
narrow
passage
it
opened
upon
my
next
recollection
is
of
sitting
up
with
my
friend
arm
supporting
me
and
inspector
ryman
holding
a
glass
to
my
lips
a
bright
glare
dazzled
my
eyes
a
crowd
surged
about
us
and
a
clangor
and
shouting
drew
momentarily
nearer
it
the
engines
coming
explained
smith
seeing
my
bewilderment
is
in
flames
it
was
your
shot
as
you
fell
through
the
trap
broke
the
is
everybody
out
so
far
as
we
know
smith
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
one
has
seen
him
there
was
some
door
at
the
back
do
you
think
he
may
no
he
said
tensely
not
until
i
see
him
lying
dead
before
me
shall
i
believe
it
then
memory
resumed
its
sway
i
struggled
to
my
feet
smith
where
is
she
i
cried
where
is
she
i
do
know
he
answered
she
given
us
the
slip
doctor
said
inspector
weymouth
as
a
came
swinging
round
the
corner
of
the
narrow
lane
so
has
singapore
charlie
and
i
afraid
somebody
else
we
got
six
or
eight
some
awake
and
some
asleep
but
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
let
go
again
smith
tells
me
that
the
girl
was
disguised
as
a
chinaman
i
expect
that
why
she
managed
to
slip
away
i
recalled
how
i
had
been
dragged
from
the
pit
by
the
false
queue
how
the
strange
discovery
which
had
brought
death
to
poor
cadby
had
brought
life
to
me
and
i
seemed
to
remember
too
that
smith
had
dropped
it
as
he
threw
his
arm
about
me
on
the
ladder
her
mask
the
girl
might
have
retained
but
her
wig
i
felt
certain
had
been
dropped
into
the
water
it
was
later
that
night
when
the
brigade
still
were
playing
upon
the
blackened
shell
of
what
had
been
and
smith
and
i
were
speeding
away
in
a
cab
from
the
scene
of
god
knows
how
many
crimes
that
i
had
an
idea
smith
i
said
did
you
bring
the
pigtail
with
you
that
was
found
on
cadby
yes
i
had
hoped
to
meet
the
owner
have
you
got
it
now
no
i
met
the
owner
i
thrust
my
hands
deep
into
the
pockets
of
the
big
lent
to
me
by
inspector
ryman
leaning
back
in
my
corner
we
shall
never
really
excel
at
this
business
continued
nayland
smith
we
are
far
too
sentimental
i
knew
what
it
meant
to
us
petrie
what
it
meant
to
the
world
but
i
had
the
heart
i
owed
her
your
life
i
had
to
square
the
account
chapter
vii
night
fell
on
redmoat
i
glanced
from
the
window
at
the
nocturne
in
silver
and
green
which
lay
beneath
me
to
the
west
of
the
shrubbery
with
its
broken
canopy
of
elms
and
beyond
the
copper
beech
which
marked
the
center
of
its
mazes
a
gap
offered
a
glimpse
of
the
waverney
where
it
swept
into
a
broad
faint
floated
over
the
water
these
with
the
whisper
of
leaves
alone
claimed
the
ear
ideal
rural
peace
and
the
music
of
an
english
summer
evening
but
to
my
eyes
every
shadow
holding
fantastic
terrors
to
my
ears
every
sound
a
signal
of
dread
for
the
deathful
hand
of
was
stretched
over
redmoat
at
any
hour
to
loose
strange
oriental
horrors
upon
its
inmates
well
said
nayland
smith
joining
me
at
the
window
we
had
dared
to
hope
him
dead
but
we
know
now
that
he
lives
the
rev
eltham
coughed
nervously
and
i
turned
leaning
my
elbow
upon
the
table
and
studied
the
play
of
expression
upon
the
refined
sensitive
face
of
the
clergyman
you
think
i
acted
rightly
in
sending
for
you
mr
smith
nayland
smith
smoked
furiously
eltham
he
replied
you
see
in
me
a
man
groping
in
the
dark
i
am
no
nearer
to
the
conclusion
of
my
mission
than
upon
the
day
when
i
left
mandalay
you
offer
me
a
clew
i
am
here
your
affair
i
believe
stands
thus
a
series
of
attempted
burglaries
or
something
of
the
kind
has
alarmed
your
household
yesterday
returning
from
london
with
your
daughter
you
were
both
drugged
in
some
way
and
occupying
a
compartment
to
yourselves
you
both
slept
your
daughter
awoke
and
saw
someone
else
in
the
carriage
a
man
who
held
a
case
of
instruments
in
his
hands
yes
i
was
of
course
unable
to
enter
into
particulars
over
the
telephone
the
man
was
standing
by
one
of
the
windows
directly
he
observed
that
my
daughter
was
awake
he
stepped
towards
her
what
did
he
do
with
the
case
in
his
hands
she
did
not
notice
or
did
not
mention
having
noticed
in
fact
as
was
natural
she
was
so
frightened
that
she
recalls
nothing
more
beyond
the
fact
that
she
strove
to
arouse
me
without
succeeding
felt
hands
grasp
her
shoulders
and
swooned
but
someone
used
the
emergency
cord
and
stopped
the
train
greba
has
no
recollection
of
having
done
so
hm
of
course
no
man
was
on
the
train
when
did
you
awake
i
was
aroused
by
the
guard
but
only
when
he
had
repeatedly
shaken
me
upon
reaching
great
yarmouth
you
immediately
called
up
scotland
yard
you
acted
very
wisely
sir
how
long
were
you
in
china
eltham
start
of
surprise
was
almost
comical
it
is
perhaps
not
strange
that
you
should
be
aware
of
my
residence
in
china
smith
he
said
but
my
not
having
mentioned
it
may
seem
so
the
fact
is
his
sensitive
face
flushed
in
palpable
embarrassment
i
left
china
under
what
i
may
term
an
episcopal
cloud
i
have
lived
in
retirement
ever
since
unwittingly
i
solemnly
declare
to
you
smith
unwittingly
i
stirred
up
certain
prejudices
in
my
endeavors
to
do
my
duty
my
duty
i
think
you
asked
me
how
long
i
was
in
china
i
was
there
from
until
four
years
i
recall
the
circumstances
eltham
said
smith
with
an
odd
note
in
his
voice
i
have
been
endeavoring
to
think
where
i
had
come
across
the
name
and
a
moment
ago
i
remembered
i
am
happy
to
have
met
you
sir
the
clergyman
blushed
again
like
a
girl
and
slightly
inclined
his
head
with
its
scanty
fair
hair
has
redmoat
as
its
name
implies
a
moat
round
it
i
was
unable
to
see
in
the
dusk
it
remains
redmoat
a
corruption
of
round
moat
was
formerly
a
priory
disestablished
by
the
eighth
henry
in
his
pedantic
manner
was
quaint
at
times
but
the
moat
is
no
longer
flooded
in
fact
we
grow
cabbages
in
part
of
it
if
you
refer
to
the
strategic
strength
of
the
place
he
smiled
but
his
manner
was
embarrassed
again
it
is
considerable
i
have
barbed
wire
fencing
and
other
arrangements
you
see
it
is
a
lonely
spot
he
added
apologetically
and
now
if
you
will
excuse
me
we
will
resume
these
gruesome
inquiries
after
the
more
pleasant
affairs
of
dinner
he
left
us
who
is
our
host
i
asked
as
the
door
closed
smith
smiled
you
are
wondering
what
caused
the
cloud
he
suggested
well
the
prejudices
which
our
reverend
friend
stirred
up
culminated
in
the
boxer
risings
good
heavens
smith
i
said
for
i
could
not
reconcile
the
diffident
personality
of
the
clergyman
with
the
memories
which
those
words
awakened
he
evidently
should
be
on
our
danger
list
my
friend
continued
quickly
but
he
has
so
completely
effaced
himself
of
recent
years
that
i
think
it
probable
that
someone
else
has
only
just
recalled
his
existence
to
mind
the
rev
eltham
my
dear
petrie
though
he
may
be
a
poor
hand
at
saving
souls
at
any
rate
has
saved
a
score
of
christian
women
from
death
and
worse

i
began
is
dan
rapped
smith
the
missionary
the
man
who
with
a
garrison
of
a
dozen
cripples
and
a
german
doctor
held
the
hospital
at
against
two
hundred
boxers
that
who
the
rev
eltham
is
but
what
is
he
up
to
now
i
have
yet
to
find
out
he
is
keeping
something
back
something
which
has
made
him
an
object
of
interest
to
young
china
during
dinner
the
matters
responsible
for
our
presence
there
did
not
hold
priority
in
the
conversation
in
fact
this
for
the
most
part
consisted
in
light
talk
of
books
and
theaters
greba
eltham
the
clergyman
daughter
was
a
charming
young
hostess
and
she
with
vernon
denby
eltham
nephew
completed
the
party
no
doubt
the
girl
presence
in
part
at
any
rate
led
us
to
refrain
from
the
subject
uppermost
in
our
minds
these
little
pools
of
calm
dotted
along
the
torrential
course
of
the
circumstances
which
were
bearing
my
friend
and
me
onward
to
unknown
issues
form
pleasant
sunny
spots
in
my
dark
recollections
so
i
shall
always
remember
with
pleasure
that
at
redmoat
in
the
it
was
so
very
peaceful
so
almost
grotesquely
calm
for
i
within
my
very
bones
felt
it
to
be
the
calm
before
the
storm
when
later
we
men
passed
to
the
library
we
seemed
to
leave
that
atmosphere
behind
us
redmoat
said
the
rev
eltham
has
latterly
become
the
theater
of
strange
doings
he
stood
on
the
a
shaded
lamp
upon
the
big
table
and
candles
in
ancient
sconces
upon
the
mantelpiece
afforded
dim
illumination
eltham
nephew
vernon
denby
lolled
smoking
on
the
and
i
sat
near
to
him
nayland
smith
paced
restlessly
up
and
down
the
room
some
months
ago
almost
a
year
continued
the
clergyman
a
burglarious
attempt
was
made
upon
the
house
there
was
an
arrest
and
the
man
confessed
that
he
had
been
tempted
by
my
collection
he
waved
his
hand
vaguely
towards
the
several
cabinets
about
the
shadowed
room
it
was
shortly
afterwards
that
i
allowed
my
hobby
for
playing
at
forts
to
run
away
with
me
he
smiled
an
apology
i
virtually
fortified
redmoat
against
trespassers
of
any
kind
i
mean
you
have
seen
that
the
house
stands
upon
a
kind
of
large
mound
this
is
artificial
being
the
buried
ruins
of
a
roman
outwork
a
portion
of
the
ancient
castrum
again
he
waved
indicatively
this
time
toward
the
window
when
it
was
a
priory
it
was
completely
isolated
and
defended
by
its
environing
moat
today
it
is
completely
surrounded
by
fencing
below
this
fence
on
the
east
is
a
narrow
stream
a
tributary
of
the
waverney
on
the
north
and
west
the
high
road
but
nearly
twenty
feet
below
the
banks
being
perpendicular
on
the
south
is
the
remaining
part
of
the
moat
now
my
kitchen
garden
but
from
there
up
to
the
level
of
the
house
is
nearly
twenty
feet
again
and
the
barbed
wire
must
also
be
counted
with
the
entrance
as
you
know
is
by
the
way
of
a
kind
of
cutting
there
is
a
gate
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
they
are
some
of
the
original
steps
of
the
priory
petrie
and
another
gate
at
the
head
he
paused
and
smiled
around
upon
us
boyishly
my
secret
defenses
remain
to
be
mentioned
he
resumed
and
opening
a
cupboard
he
pointed
to
a
row
of
batteries
with
a
number
of
electric
bells
upon
the
wall
behind
the
more
vulnerable
spots
are
connected
at
night
with
these
bells
he
said
triumphantly
any
attempt
to
scale
the
barbed
wire
or
to
force
either
gate
would
set
two
or
more
of
these
ringing
a
stray
cow
raised
one
false
alarm
he
added
and
a
careless
rook
threw
us
into
a
perfect
panic
on
another
occasion
he
was
so
boyish
so
nervously
brisk
and
acutely
sensitive
that
it
was
difficult
to
see
in
him
the
hero
of
the
hospital
i
could
only
suppose
that
he
had
treated
the
boxers
raid
in
the
same
spirit
wherein
he
met
trespassers
within
the
precincts
of
redmoat
it
had
been
an
escapade
of
which
he
was
afterwards
ashamed
as
faintly
he
was
ashamed
of
his
fortifications
but
rapped
smith
it
was
not
the
visit
of
the
burglar
which
prompted
these
elaborate
precautions
eltham
coughed
nervously
i
am
aware
he
said
that
having
invoked
official
aid
i
must
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
smith
it
was
the
burglar
who
was
responsible
for
my
continuing
the
wire
fence
all
round
the
grounds
but
the
electrical
contrivance
followed
later
as
a
result
of
several
disturbed
nights
my
servants
grew
uneasy
about
someone
who
came
they
said
after
dusk
no
one
could
describe
this
nocturnal
visitor
but
certainly
we
found
traces
i
must
admit
that
then
i
received
what
i
may
term
a
warning
my
position
is
a
peculiar
one
a
peculiar
one
my
daughter
too
saw
this
prowling
person
over
by
the
roman
castrum
and
described
him
as
a
yellow
man
it
was
the
incident
in
the
train
following
closely
upon
this
other
which
led
me
to
speak
to
the
police
little
as
i
desired
to
er
court
publicity
nayland
smith
walked
to
a
window
and
looked
out
across
the
sloping
lawn
to
where
the
shadows
of
the
shrubbery
lay
a
dog
was
howling
dismally
somewhere
your
defenses
are
not
impregnable
after
all
then
he
jerked
on
our
way
up
this
evening
denby
was
telling
us
about
the
death
of
his
collie
a
few
nights
ago
the
clergyman
face
clouded
that
certainly
was
alarming
he
confessed
i
had
been
in
london
for
a
few
days
and
during
my
absence
vernon
came
down
bringing
the
dog
with
him
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
it
ran
barking
into
the
shrubbery
yonder
and
did
not
come
out
he
went
to
look
for
it
with
a
lantern
and
found
it
lying
among
the
bushes
quite
dead
the
poor
creature
had
been
dreadfully
beaten
about
the
head
the
gates
were
locked
denby
interrupted
and
no
one
could
have
got
out
of
the
grounds
without
a
ladder
and
someone
to
assist
him
but
there
was
no
sign
of
a
living
thing
about
edwards
and
i
searched
every
corner
how
long
has
that
other
dog
taken
to
howling
inquired
smith
only
since
rex
death
said
denby
quickly
it
is
my
mastiff
explained
the
clergyman
and
he
is
confined
in
the
yard
he
is
never
allowed
on
this
side
of
the
house
nayland
smith
wandered
aimlessly
about
the
library
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
press
you
eltham
he
said
but
what
was
the
nature
of
the
warning
to
which
you
referred
and
from
whom
did
it
come
eltham
hesitated
for
a
long
time
i
have
been
so
unfortunate
he
said
at
last
in
my
previous
efforts
that
i
feel
assured
of
your
hostile
criticism
when
i
tell
you
that
i
am
contemplating
an
immediate
return
to
smith
jumped
round
upon
him
as
though
moved
by
a
spring
then
you
are
going
back
to
he
cried
now
i
understand
why
have
you
not
told
me
before
that
is
the
key
for
which
i
have
vainly
been
seeking
your
troubles
date
from
the
time
of
your
decision
to
return
yes
i
must
admit
it
confessed
the
clergyman
diffidently
and
your
warning
came
from
china
it
did
from
a
chinaman
from
the
mandarin
my
good
sir
he
warned
you
to
abandon
your
visit
and
you
reject
his
advice
listen
to
me
smith
was
intensely
excited
now
his
eyes
bright
his
lean
figure
curiously
strung
up
alert
the
mandarin
is
one
of
the
seven
i
do
not
follow
you
mr
smith
no
sir
china
is
not
the
china
of
it
is
a
huge
secret
machine
and
one
of
its
most
important
wheels
but
if
as
i
understand
this
official
is
a
friend
of
yours
believe
me
he
has
saved
your
life
you
would
be
a
dead
man
now
if
it
were
not
for
your
friend
in
china
my
dear
sir
you
must
accept
his
counsel
then
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
made
his
acquaintance
parson
dan
showed
through
the
surface
of
the
rev
eltham
no
sir
replied
the
clergyman
and
the
change
in
his
voice
was
startling
i
am
called
to
only
one
may
deter
my
going
the
admixture
of
deep
spiritual
reverence
with
intense
truculence
in
his
voice
was
dissimilar
from
anything
i
ever
had
heard
then
only
one
can
protect
you
cried
smith
for
by
heaven
no
man
will
be
able
to
do
so
your
presence
in
can
do
no
possible
good
at
present
it
must
do
harm
your
experience
in
should
be
fresh
in
your
memory
hard
words
mr
smith
the
class
of
missionary
work
which
you
favor
sir
is
injurious
to
international
peace
at
the
present
moment
is
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
you
would
be
the
lighted
match
i
do
not
willingly
stand
between
any
man
and
what
he
chooses
to
consider
his
duty
but
i
insist
that
you
abandon
your
visit
to
the
interior
of
china
you
insist
mr
smith
as
your
guest
i
regret
the
necessity
for
reminding
you
that
i
hold
authority
to
enforce
it
denby
fidgeted
uneasily
the
tone
of
the
conversation
was
growing
harsh
and
the
atmosphere
of
the
library
portentous
with
brewing
storms
there
was
a
short
silent
interval
this
is
what
i
had
feared
and
expected
said
the
clergyman
this
was
my
reason
for
not
seeking
official
protection
the
phantom
yellow
peril
said
nayland
smith
materializes
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
western
world
the
peril
you
scoff
sir
and
so
do
others
we
take
the
proffered
right
hand
of
friendship
nor
inquire
if
the
hidden
left
holds
a
knife
the
peace
of
the
world
is
at
stake
eltham
unknowingly
you
tamper
with
tremendous
issues
eltham
drew
a
deep
breath
thrusting
both
hands
in
his
pockets
you
are
painfully
frank
smith
he
said
but
i
like
you
for
it
i
will
reconsider
my
position
and
talk
this
matter
over
again
with
you
thus
then
the
storm
blew
over
yet
i
had
never
experienced
such
an
overwhelming
sense
of
imminent
peril
of
a
sinister
presence
as
oppressed
me
at
that
moment
the
very
atmosphere
of
redmoat
was
impregnated
with
eastern
devilry
it
loaded
the
air
like
some
evil
perfume
and
then
through
the
silence
cut
a
throbbing
scream
the
scream
of
a
woman
in
direst
fear
my
god
it
greba
whispered
eltham
chapter
viii
in
what
order
we
dashed
down
to
the
i
can
not
recall
but
none
was
before
me
when
i
leaped
over
the
threshold
and
saw
miss
eltham
prone
by
the
french
windows
these
were
closed
and
bolted
and
she
lay
with
hands
outstretched
in
the
alcove
which
they
formed
i
bent
over
her
nayland
smith
was
at
my
elbow
get
my
bag
i
said
she
has
swooned
it
is
nothing
serious
her
father
pale
and
hovered
about
me
muttering
incoherently
but
i
managed
to
reassure
him
and
his
gratitude
when
i
having
administered
a
simple
restorative
the
girl
sighed
shudderingly
and
opened
her
eyes
was
quite
pathetic
i
would
permit
no
questioning
at
that
time
and
on
her
father
arm
she
retired
to
her
own
rooms
it
was
some
fifteen
minutes
later
that
her
message
was
brought
to
me
i
followed
the
maid
to
a
quaint
little
octagonal
apartment
and
greba
eltham
stood
before
me
the
candlelight
caressing
the
soft
curves
of
her
face
and
gleaming
in
the
meshes
of
her
rich
brown
hair
when
she
had
answered
my
first
question
she
hesitated
in
pretty
confusion
we
are
anxious
to
know
what
alarmed
you
miss
eltham
she
bit
her
lip
and
glanced
with
apprehension
towards
the
window
i
am
almost
afraid
to
tell
father
she
began
rapidly
he
will
think
me
imaginative
but
you
have
been
so
kind
it
was
two
green
eyes
oh
petrie
they
looked
up
at
me
from
the
steps
leading
to
the
lawn
and
they
shone
like
the
eyes
of
a
cat
the
words
thrilled
me
strangely
are
you
sure
it
was
not
a
cat
miss
eltham
the
eyes
were
too
large
petrie
there
was
something
dreadful
most
dreadful
in
their
appearance
i
feel
foolish
and
silly
for
having
fainted
twice
in
two
days
but
the
suspense
is
telling
upon
me
i
suppose
father
thinks
she
was
becoming
charmingly
confidential
as
a
woman
often
will
with
a
tactful
physician
that
shut
up
here
we
are
safe
from
whatever
threatens
us
i
noted
with
concern
a
repetition
of
the
nervous
shudder
but
since
our
return
someone
else
has
been
in
redmoat
whatever
do
you
mean
miss
eltham
oh
i
do
quite
know
what
i
do
mean
petrie
what
does
it
all
mean
vernon
has
been
explaining
to
me
that
some
awful
chinaman
is
seeking
the
life
of
nayland
smith
but
if
the
same
man
wants
to
kill
my
father
why
has
he
not
done
so
i
am
afraid
you
puzzle
me
of
course
i
must
do
so
but
the
man
in
the
train
he
could
have
killed
us
both
quite
easily
and
last
night
someone
was
in
room
in
his
room
i
could
not
sleep
and
i
heard
something
moving
my
room
is
the
next
one
i
knocked
on
the
wall
and
woke
father
there
was
nothing
so
i
said
it
was
the
howling
of
the
dog
that
had
frightened
me
how
could
anyone
get
into
his
room
i
can
not
imagine
but
i
am
not
sure
it
was
a
man
miss
eltham
you
alarm
me
what
do
you
suspect
you
must
think
me
hysterical
and
silly
but
whilst
father
and
i
have
been
away
from
redmoat
perhaps
the
usual
precautions
have
been
neglected
is
there
any
creature
any
large
creature
which
could
climb
up
the
wall
to
the
window
do
you
know
of
anything
with
a
long
thin
body
for
a
moment
i
offered
no
reply
studying
the
girl
pretty
face
her
eager
eyes
widely
opened
and
fixed
upon
mine
she
was
not
of
the
neurotic
type
with
her
clear
complexion
and
neck
her
arms
healthily
toned
by
exposure
to
the
country
airs
were
rounded
and
firm
and
she
had
the
agile
shape
of
a
young
diana
with
none
of
the
anaemic
languor
which
breeds
morbid
dreams
she
was
frightened
yes
who
would
not
have
been
but
the
mere
idea
of
this
thing
which
she
believed
to
be
in
redmoat
without
the
apparition
of
the
green
eyes
must
have
prostrated
a
victim
of
nerves
have
you
seen
such
a
creature
miss
eltham
she
hesitated
again
glancing
down
and
pressing
her
together
as
father
awoke
and
called
out
to
know
why
i
knocked
i
glanced
from
my
window
the
moonlight
threw
half
the
lawn
into
shadow
and
just
disappearing
in
this
shadow
was
something
something
of
a
brown
color
marked
with
sections
what
size
and
shape
it
moved
so
quickly
i
could
form
no
idea
of
its
shape
but
i
saw
quite
six
feet
of
it
flash
across
the
grass
did
you
hear
anything
a
swishing
sound
in
the
shrubbery
then
nothing
more
she
met
my
eyes
expectantly
her
confidence
in
my
powers
of
understanding
and
sympathy
was
gratifying
though
i
knew
that
i
but
occupied
the
position
of
a
have
you
any
idea
i
said
how
it
came
about
that
you
awoke
in
the
train
yesterday
whilst
your
father
did
not
we
had
coffee
at
a
it
must
have
been
drugged
in
some
way
i
scarcely
tasted
mine
the
flavor
was
so
awful
but
father
is
an
old
traveler
and
drank
the
whole
of
his
cupful
eltham
voice
called
from
below
petrie
said
the
girl
quickly
what
do
you
think
they
want
to
do
to
him
ah
i
replied
i
wish
i
knew
that
will
you
think
over
what
i
have
told
you
for
i
do
assure
you
there
is
something
here
in
redmoat
something
that
comes
and
goes
in
spite
of
father
caesar
knows
there
is
listen
to
him
he
drags
at
his
chain
so
that
i
wonder
he
does
not
break
it
as
we
passed
downstairs
the
howling
of
the
mastiff
sounded
eerily
through
the
house
as
did
the
of
the
tightening
chain
as
he
threw
the
weight
of
his
big
body
upon
it
i
sat
in
smith
room
that
night
for
some
time
he
pacing
the
floor
smoking
and
talking
eltham
has
influential
chinese
friends
he
said
but
they
dare
not
have
him
in
at
present
he
knows
the
country
as
he
knows
norfolk
he
would
see
things
his
precautions
here
have
baffled
the
enemy
i
think
the
attempt
in
the
train
points
to
an
anxiety
to
waste
no
opportunity
but
whilst
eltham
was
absent
he
was
getting
his
outfit
in
london
by
the
way
they
have
been
fixing
some
second
string
to
their
fiddle
here
in
case
no
opportunity
offered
before
he
returned
they
provided
for
getting
at
him
here
but
how
smith
that
the
mystery
but
the
dead
dog
in
the
shrubbery
is
significant
do
you
think
some
emissary
of
is
actually
inside
the
moat
it
impossible
petrie
you
are
thinking
of
secret
passages
and
so
forth
there
are
none
eltham
has
measured
up
every
foot
of
the
place
there
is
a
rathole
left
unaccounted
for
and
as
for
a
tunnel
under
the
moat
the
house
stands
on
a
solid
mass
of
roman
masonry
a
former
camp
of
hadrian
time
i
have
seen
a
very
old
plan
of
the
round
moat
priory
as
it
was
called
there
is
no
entrance
and
no
exit
save
by
the
steps
so
how
was
the
dog
killed
i
knocked
out
my
pipe
on
a
bar
of
the
grate
we
are
in
the
thick
of
it
here
i
said
we
are
always
in
the
thick
of
it
replied
smith
our
danger
is
no
greater
in
norfolk
than
in
london
but
what
do
they
want
to
do
that
man
in
the
train
with
the
case
of
instruments
what
instruments
then
the
apparition
of
the
green
eyes
can
they
have
been
the
eyes
of
is
some
peculiarly
unique
outrage
contemplated
something
calling
for
the
presence
of
the
master
he
may
have
to
prevent
eltham
leaving
england
without
killing
him
quite
so
he
probably
has
instructions
to
be
merciful
but
god
help
the
victim
of
chinese
mercy
i
went
to
my
own
room
then
but
i
did
not
even
undress
refilling
my
pipe
and
seating
myself
at
the
open
window
having
looked
upon
the
awful
chinese
doctor
the
memory
of
his
face
with
its
filmed
green
eyes
could
never
leave
me
the
idea
that
he
might
be
near
at
that
moment
was
a
poor
narcotic
the
howling
and
baying
of
the
mastiff
was
almost
continuous
when
all
else
in
redmoat
was
still
the
dog
mournful
note
yet
rose
on
the
night
with
something
menacing
in
it
i
sat
looking
out
across
the
sloping
turf
to
where
the
shrubbery
showed
as
a
black
island
in
a
green
sea
the
moon
swam
in
a
cloudless
sky
and
the
air
was
warm
and
fragrant
with
country
scents
it
was
in
the
shrubbery
that
denby
collie
had
met
his
mysterious
death
that
the
thing
seen
by
miss
eltham
had
disappeared
what
uncanny
secret
did
it
hold
caesar
became
silent
as
the
stopping
of
a
clock
will
sometimes
awaken
a
sleeper
the
abrupt
cessation
of
that
distant
howling
to
which
i
had
grown
accustomed
now
recalled
me
from
a
world
of
gloomy
imaginings
i
glanced
at
my
watch
in
the
moonlight
it
was
twelve
minutes
past
midnight
as
i
replaced
it
the
dog
suddenly
burst
out
afresh
but
now
in
a
tone
of
sheer
anger
he
was
alternately
howling
and
snarling
in
a
way
that
sounded
new
to
me
the
crashes
as
he
leapt
to
the
end
of
his
chain
shook
the
building
in
which
he
was
confined
it
was
as
i
stood
up
to
lean
from
the
window
and
commanded
a
view
of
the
corner
of
the
house
that
he
broke
loose
with
a
hoarse
bay
he
took
that
decisive
leap
and
i
heard
his
heavy
body
fall
against
the
wooden
wall
there
followed
a
strange
guttural
cry
and
the
growling
of
the
dog
died
away
at
the
rear
of
the
house
he
was
out
but
that
guttural
note
had
not
come
from
the
throat
of
a
dog
of
what
was
he
in
pursuit
at
which
point
his
mysterious
quarry
entered
the
shrubbery
i
do
not
know
i
only
know
that
i
saw
absolutely
nothing
until
caesar
lithe
shape
was
streaked
across
the
lawn
and
the
great
creature
went
crashing
into
the
undergrowth
then
a
faint
sound
above
and
to
my
right
told
me
that
i
was
not
the
only
spectator
of
the
scene
i
leaned
farther
from
the
window
is
that
you
miss
eltham
i
asked
oh
dr
petrie
she
said
i
am
so
glad
you
are
awake
can
we
do
nothing
to
help
caesar
will
be
killed
did
you
see
what
he
went
after
no
she
called
back
and
drew
her
breath
sharply
for
a
strange
figure
went
racing
across
the
grass
it
was
that
of
a
man
in
a
blue
who
held
a
lantern
high
before
him
and
a
revolver
in
his
right
hand
coincident
with
my
recognition
of
eltham
he
leaped
plunging
into
the
shrubbery
in
the
wake
of
the
dog
but
the
night
held
yet
another
surprise
for
nayland
smith
voice
came
come
back
come
back
eltham
i
ran
out
into
the
passage
and
downstairs
the
front
door
was
open
a
terrible
conflict
waged
in
the
shrubbery
between
the
mastiff
and
something
else
passing
round
to
the
lawn
i
met
smith
fully
dressed
he
just
had
dropped
from
a
window
the
man
is
mad
he
snapped
heaven
knows
what
lurks
there
he
should
not
have
gone
alone
together
we
ran
towards
the
dancing
light
of
eltham
lantern
the
sounds
of
conflict
ceased
suddenly
stumbling
over
stumps
and
lashed
by
branches
we
struggled
forward
to
where
the
clergyman
knelt
amongst
the
bushes
he
glanced
up
with
tears
in
his
eyes
as
was
revealed
by
the
dim
light
look
he
cried
the
body
of
the
dog
lay
at
his
feet
it
was
pitiable
to
think
that
the
fearless
brute
should
have
met
his
death
in
such
a
fashion
and
when
i
bent
and
examined
him
i
was
glad
to
find
traces
of
life
drag
him
out
he
is
not
dead
i
said
and
hurry
rapped
smith
peering
about
him
right
and
left
so
we
three
hurried
from
that
haunted
place
dragging
the
dog
with
us
we
were
not
molested
no
sound
disturbed
the
now
perfect
stillness
by
the
lawn
edge
we
came
upon
denby
half
dressed
and
almost
immediately
edwards
the
gardener
also
appeared
the
white
faces
of
the
house
servants
showed
at
one
window
and
miss
eltham
called
to
me
from
her
room
is
he
dead
no
i
replied
only
stunned
we
carried
the
dog
round
to
the
yard
and
i
examined
his
head
it
had
been
struck
by
some
heavy
blunt
instrument
but
the
skull
was
not
broken
it
is
hard
to
kill
a
mastiff
will
you
attend
to
him
doctor
asked
eltham
we
must
see
that
the
villain
does
not
escape
his
face
was
grim
and
set
this
was
a
different
man
from
the
diffident
clergyman
we
knew
this
was
parson
dan
again
i
accepted
the
care
of
the
canine
patient
and
eltham
with
the
others
went
off
for
more
lights
to
search
the
shrubbery
as
i
was
washing
a
bad
wound
between
the
mastiff
ears
miss
eltham
joined
me
it
was
the
sound
of
her
voice
i
think
rather
than
my
more
scientific
ministration
which
recalled
caesar
to
life
for
as
she
entered
his
tail
wagged
feebly
and
a
moment
later
he
struggled
to
his
feet
one
of
which
was
injured
having
provided
for
his
immediate
needs
i
left
him
in
charge
of
his
young
mistress
and
joined
the
search
party
they
had
entered
the
shrubbery
from
four
points
and
drawn
blank
there
is
absolutely
nothing
there
and
no
one
can
possibly
have
left
the
grounds
said
eltham
amazedly
we
stood
on
the
lawn
looking
at
one
another
nayland
smith
angry
but
thoughtful
tugging
at
the
lobe
of
his
left
ear
as
was
his
habit
in
moments
of
perplexity
chapter
ix
with
the
first
coming
of
light
eltham
smith
and
i
tested
the
electrical
contrivances
from
every
point
they
were
in
perfect
order
it
became
more
and
more
incomprehensible
how
anyone
could
have
entered
and
quitted
redmoat
during
the
night
the
fencing
was
intact
and
bore
no
signs
of
having
been
tampered
with
smith
and
i
undertook
an
exhaustive
examination
of
the
shrubbery
at
the
spot
where
we
had
found
the
dog
some
five
paces
to
the
west
of
the
copper
beech
the
grass
and
weeds
were
trampled
and
the
surrounding
laurels
and
rhododendrons
bore
evidence
of
a
struggle
but
no
human
footprint
could
be
found
the
ground
is
dry
said
smith
we
can
not
expect
much
in
my
opinion
i
said
someone
tried
to
get
at
caesar
his
presence
is
dangerous
and
in
his
rage
he
broke
loose
i
think
so
too
agreed
smith
but
why
did
this
person
make
for
here
and
how
having
mastered
the
dog
get
out
of
redmoat
i
am
open
to
admit
the
possibility
of
someone
getting
in
during
the
day
whilst
the
gates
are
open
and
hiding
until
dusk
but
how
in
the
name
of
all
that
wonderful
does
he
get
out
he
must
possess
the
attributes
of
a
bird
i
thought
of
greba
eltham
statements
reminding
my
friend
of
her
description
of
the
thing
which
she
had
seen
passing
into
this
strangely
haunted
shrubbery
that
line
of
speculation
soon
takes
us
out
of
our
depth
petrie
he
said
let
us
stick
to
what
we
can
understand
and
that
may
help
us
to
a
clearer
idea
of
what
at
present
is
incomprehensible
my
view
of
the
case
to
date
stands
thus
eltham
having
rashly
decided
to
return
to
the
interior
of
china
is
warned
by
an
official
whose
friendship
he
has
won
in
some
way
to
stay
in
england
i
know
this
official
for
one
of
the
yellow
group
represented
in
england
by
several
attempts
of
which
we
know
but
little
to
get
at
eltham
are
frustrated
presumably
by
his
curious
an
attempt
in
a
train
fails
owing
to
miss
eltham
distaste
for
coffee
an
attempt
here
fails
owing
to
her
insomnia
during
eltham
absence
from
redmoat
certain
preparations
are
made
for
his
return
these
lead
to
a
the
death
of
denby
collie
b
the
things
heard
and
seen
by
miss
eltham
c
the
things
heard
and
seen
by
us
all
last
night
so
that
the
clearing
up
of
my
fourth
point
id
est
the
discovery
of
the
nature
of
these
preparations
becomes
our
immediate
concern
the
prime
object
of
these
preparations
petrie
was
to
enable
someone
to
gain
access
to
eltham
room
the
other
events
are
incidental
the
dogs
had
to
be
got
rid
of
for
instance
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
miss
eltham
wakefulness
saved
her
father
a
second
time
but
from
what
for
heaven
sake
from
what
smith
glanced
about
into
the
shadows
from
a
visit
by
someone
perhaps
by
himself
he
said
in
a
hushed
voice
the
object
of
that
visit
i
hope
we
may
never
learn
for
that
would
mean
that
it
had
been
achieved
smith
i
said
i
do
not
altogether
understand
you
but
do
you
think
he
has
some
incredible
creature
hidden
here
somewhere
it
would
be
like
him
i
begin
to
suspect
the
most
formidable
creature
in
the
known
world
to
be
hidden
here
i
believe
is
somewhere
inside
redmoat
our
conversation
was
interrupted
at
this
point
by
denby
who
came
to
report
that
he
had
examined
the
moat
the
roadside
and
the
bank
of
the
stream
but
found
no
footprints
or
clew
of
any
kind
no
one
left
the
grounds
of
redmoat
last
night
i
think
he
said
and
his
voice
had
awe
in
it
that
day
dragged
slowly
on
a
party
of
us
scoured
the
neighborhood
for
traces
of
strangers
examining
every
foot
of
the
roman
ruin
hard
by
but
vainly
may
not
your
presence
here
induce
to
abandon
his
plans
i
asked
smith
i
think
not
he
replied
you
see
unless
we
can
prevail
upon
him
eltham
sails
in
a
fortnight
so
the
doctor
has
no
time
to
waste
furthermore
i
have
an
idea
that
his
arrangements
are
of
such
a
character
that
they
must
go
forward
he
might
turn
aside
of
course
to
assassinate
me
if
opportunity
arose
but
we
know
from
experience
that
he
permits
nothing
to
interfere
with
his
schemes
there
are
few
states
i
suppose
which
exact
so
severe
a
toll
from
one
nervous
system
as
the
anticipation
of
calamity
all
anticipation
is
keener
be
it
of
joy
or
pain
than
the
reality
whereof
it
is
a
mental
forecast
but
that
inactive
waiting
at
redmoat
for
the
blow
which
we
knew
full
well
to
be
pending
exceeded
in
its
nerve
taxation
anything
i
hitherto
had
experienced
i
felt
as
one
bound
upon
an
aztec
altar
with
the
priest
obsidian
knife
raised
above
my
breast
secret
and
malign
forces
throbbed
about
us
forces
against
which
we
had
no
armor
dreadful
as
it
was
i
count
it
a
mercy
that
the
climax
was
reached
so
quickly
and
it
came
suddenly
enough
for
there
in
that
quiet
norfolk
home
we
found
ourselves
at
hand
grips
with
one
of
the
mysterious
horrors
which
characterized
the
operations
of
it
was
upon
us
before
we
realized
it
there
is
no
incidental
music
to
the
dramas
of
real
life
as
we
sat
on
the
little
terrace
in
the
creeping
twilight
i
remember
thinking
how
the
peace
of
the
scene
gave
the
lie
to
my
fears
that
we
bordered
upon
tragic
things
then
caesar
who
had
been
a
docile
patient
all
day
began
howling
again
and
i
saw
greba
eltham
shudder
i
caught
smith
eye
and
was
about
to
propose
our
retirement
indoors
when
the
party
was
broken
up
in
more
turbulent
fashion
i
suppose
it
was
the
presence
of
the
girl
which
prompted
denby
to
the
rash
act
a
desire
personally
to
distinguish
himself
but
as
i
recalled
afterwards
his
gaze
had
rarely
left
the
shrubbery
since
dusk
save
to
seek
her
face
and
now
he
leaped
wildly
to
his
feet
overturning
his
chair
and
dashed
across
the
grass
to
the
trees
did
you
see
it
he
yelled
did
you
see
it
he
evidently
carried
a
revolver
for
from
the
edge
of
the
shrubbery
a
shot
sounded
and
in
the
flash
we
saw
denby
with
the
weapon
raised
greba
go
in
and
fasten
the
windows
cried
eltham
smith
will
you
enter
the
bushes
from
the
west
petrie
east
edwards
edwards
and
he
was
off
across
the
lawn
with
the
nervous
activity
of
a
cat
as
i
made
off
in
an
opposite
direction
i
heard
the
gardener
voice
from
the
lower
gate
and
i
saw
eltham
plan
it
was
to
surround
the
shrubbery
two
more
shots
and
two
flashes
from
the
dense
heart
of
greenwood
then
a
loud
cry
i
thought
from
denby
and
a
second
muffled
one
following
silence
only
broken
by
the
howling
of
the
mastiff
i
sprinted
through
the
rose
garden
leaped
heedlessly
over
a
bed
of
geranium
and
heliotrope
and
plunged
in
among
the
bushes
and
under
the
elms
away
on
the
left
i
heard
edwards
shouting
and
answering
voice
denby
i
cried
and
yet
louder
denby
but
the
silence
fell
again
dusk
was
upon
redmoat
now
but
from
sitting
in
the
twilight
my
eyes
had
grown
accustomed
to
gloom
and
i
could
see
fairly
well
what
lay
before
me
not
daring
to
think
what
might
lurk
above
below
around
me
i
pressed
on
into
the
midst
of
the
thicket
vernon
came
eltham
voice
from
one
side
bear
more
to
the
right
edwards
i
heard
nayland
smith
cry
directly
ahead
of
me
with
an
eerie
and
indescribable
sensation
of
impending
disaster
upon
me
i
thrust
my
way
through
to
a
gray
patch
which
marked
a
break
in
the
elmen
roof
at
the
foot
of
the
copper
beech
i
almost
fell
over
eltham
then
smith
plunged
into
view
lastly
edwards
the
gardener
rounded
a
big
rhododendron
and
completed
the
party
we
stood
quite
still
for
a
moment
a
faint
breeze
whispered
through
the
beech
leaves
where
is
he
i
can
not
remember
who
put
it
into
words
i
was
too
dazed
with
amazement
to
notice
then
eltham
began
shouting
vernon
vernon
vernon
his
voice
pitched
higher
upon
each
repetition
there
was
something
horrible
about
that
vain
calling
under
the
whispering
beech
with
shrubs
banked
about
us
cloaking
god
alone
could
know
what
from
the
back
of
the
house
came
caesar
faint
reply
quick
lights
rapped
smith
every
lamp
you
have
off
we
went
dodging
laurels
and
privets
and
poured
out
on
to
the
lawn
a
disordered
company
eltham
face
was
deathly
pale
and
his
jaw
set
hard
he
met
my
eye
god
forgive
me
he
said
i
could
do
murder
he
was
a
man
composed
of
strange
perplexities
it
seemed
an
age
before
the
lights
were
found
but
at
last
we
returned
to
the
bushes
really
after
a
very
brief
delay
and
ten
minutes
sufficed
us
to
explore
the
entire
shrubbery
for
it
was
not
extensive
we
found
his
revolver
but
there
was
no
one
there
nothing
when
we
all
stood
again
on
the
lawn
i
thought
that
i
had
never
seen
smith
so
haggard
what
in
heaven
name
can
we
do
he
muttered
what
does
it
mean
he
expected
no
answer
for
there
was
none
to
offer
one
search
everywhere
said
eltham
hoarsely
he
ran
off
into
the
rose
garden
and
began
beating
about
among
the
flowers
like
a
madman
muttering
vernon
vernon
for
close
upon
an
hour
we
all
searched
we
searched
every
square
yard
i
think
within
the
wire
fencing
and
found
no
trace
miss
eltham
slipped
out
in
the
confusion
and
joined
with
the
rest
of
us
in
that
frantic
hunt
some
of
the
servants
assisted
too
it
was
a
group
terrified
and
awestricken
which
came
together
again
on
the
terrace
one
and
then
another
would
give
up
until
only
eltham
and
smith
were
missing
then
they
came
back
together
from
examining
the
steps
to
the
lower
gate
eltham
dropped
on
to
a
rustic
seat
and
sank
his
head
in
his
hands
nayland
smith
paced
up
and
down
like
a
newly
caged
animal
snapping
his
teeth
together
and
tugging
at
his
ear
possessed
by
some
sudden
idea
or
pressed
to
action
by
his
tumultuous
thoughts
he
snatched
up
a
lantern
and
strode
silently
off
across
the
grass
and
to
the
shrubbery
once
more
i
followed
him
i
think
his
idea
was
that
he
might
surprise
anyone
who
lurked
there
he
surprised
himself
and
all
of
us
for
right
at
the
margin
he
tripped
and
fell
flat
i
ran
to
him
he
had
fallen
over
the
body
of
denby
which
lay
there
denby
had
not
been
there
a
few
moments
before
and
how
he
came
to
be
there
now
we
dared
not
conjecture
eltham
joined
us
uttered
one
short
dry
sob
and
dropped
upon
his
knees
then
we
were
carrying
denby
back
to
the
house
with
the
mastiff
howling
a
marche
funebre
we
laid
him
on
the
grass
where
it
sloped
down
from
the
terrace
nayland
smith
haggard
face
was
terrible
but
the
stark
horror
of
the
thing
inspired
him
to
that
which
conceived
earlier
had
saved
denby
twisting
suddenly
to
eltham
he
roared
in
a
voice
audible
beyond
the
river
heavens
we
are
fools
loose
the
dog
but
the
dog
i
began
smith
clapped
his
hand
over
my
mouth
i
know
he
crippled
he
whispered
but
if
anything
human
lurks
there
the
dog
will
lead
us
to
it
if
a
man
is
there
he
will
fly
why
did
we
not
think
of
it
before
fools
fools
he
raised
his
voice
again
keep
him
on
leash
edwards
he
will
lead
us
the
scheme
succeeded
edwards
barely
had
started
on
his
errand
when
bells
began
ringing
inside
the
house
wait
snapped
eltham
and
rushed
indoors
a
moment
later
he
was
out
again
his
eyes
gleaming
madly
above
the
moat
he
panted
and
we
were
off
en
masse
round
the
edge
of
the
trees
it
was
dark
above
the
moat
but
not
so
dark
as
to
prevent
our
seeing
a
narrow
ladder
of
thin
bamboo
joints
and
silken
cord
hanging
by
two
hooks
from
the
top
of
the
wire
fence
there
was
no
sound
he
out
screamed
eltham
down
the
steps
we
all
ran
our
best
and
swiftest
but
eltham
outran
us
like
a
fury
he
tore
at
bolts
and
bars
and
like
a
fury
sprang
out
into
the
road
straight
and
white
it
showed
to
the
acclivity
by
the
roman
ruin
but
no
living
thing
moved
upon
it
the
distant
baying
of
the
dog
was
borne
to
our
ears
curse
it
he
crippled
hissed
smith
without
him
as
well
pursue
a
shadow
a
few
hours
later
the
shrubbery
yielded
up
its
secret
a
simple
one
enough
a
big
cask
sunk
in
a
pit
with
a
laurel
shrub
cunningly
affixed
to
its
movable
lid
which
was
further
disguised
with
tufts
of
grass
a
slender
rod
lay
near
the
fence
it
had
a
hook
on
the
top
and
was
evidently
used
for
attaching
the
ladder
it
was
the
end
of
this
ladder
which
miss
eltham
saw
said
smith
as
he
trailed
it
behind
him
into
the
shrubbery
when
she
interrupted
him
in
her
fathers
room
he
and
whomever
he
had
with
him
doubtless
slipped
in
during
the
daytime
whilst
eltham
was
absent
in
london
bringing
the
prepared
cask
and
all
necessary
implements
with
them
they
concealed
themselves
somewhere
probably
in
the
shrubbery
and
during
the
night
made
the
cache
the
excavated
earth
would
be
disposed
of
on
the
the
dummy
bush
they
probably
had
ready
you
see
the
problem
of
getting
in
was
never
a
big
one
but
owing
to
the
it
was
impossible
whilst
eltham
was
in
residence
at
any
rate
to
get
out
after
dark
for
purposes
then
a
inside
redmoat
was
essential
his
servant
for
he
needed
assistance
must
have
been
in
hiding
somewhere
outside
heaven
knows
where
during
the
day
they
could
come
or
go
by
the
gates
as
we
have
already
noted
you
think
it
was
the
doctor
himself
it
seems
possible
who
else
has
eyes
like
the
eyes
miss
eltham
saw
from
the
window
last
night
then
remains
to
tell
the
nature
of
the
outrage
whereby
had
planned
to
prevent
eltham
leaving
england
for
china
this
we
learned
from
denby
for
denby
was
not
dead
it
was
easy
to
divine
that
he
had
stumbled
upon
the
fiendish
visitor
at
the
very
entrance
to
his
burrow
had
been
stunned
judging
from
the
evidence
with
a
and
dragged
down
into
the
cache
to
which
he
must
have
lain
in
such
dangerous
proximity
as
to
render
detection
of
the
dummy
bush
possible
in
removing
him
the
quickest
expedient
then
had
been
to
draw
him
beneath
when
the
search
of
the
shrubbery
was
concluded
his
body
had
been
borne
to
the
edge
of
the
bushes
and
laid
where
we
found
it
why
his
life
had
been
spared
i
can
not
conjecture
but
provision
had
been
made
against
his
recovering
consciousness
and
revealing
the
secret
of
the
shrubbery
the
ruse
of
releasing
the
mastiff
alone
had
terminated
the
visit
of
the
unbidden
guest
within
redmoat
denby
made
a
very
slow
recovery
and
even
when
convalescent
consciously
added
not
one
fact
to
those
we
already
had
collated
his
memory
had
completely
deserted
him
this
in
my
opinion
as
in
those
of
the
several
specialists
consulted
was
due
not
to
the
blow
on
the
head
but
to
the
presence
slightly
below
and
to
the
right
of
the
first
cervical
curve
of
the
spine
of
a
minute
puncture
undoubtedly
caused
by
a
hypodermic
syringe
then
unconsciously
poor
denby
furnished
the
last
link
in
the
chain
for
undoubtedly
by
means
of
this
operation
had
designed
to
efface
from
eltham
mind
his
plans
of
return
to
the
nature
of
the
fluid
which
could
produce
such
mental
symptoms
was
a
mystery
a
mystery
which
defied
western
science
one
of
the
many
strange
secrets
of
chapter
x
since
nayland
smith
return
from
burma
i
had
rarely
taken
up
a
paper
without
coming
upon
evidences
of
that
seething
which
had
cast
up
whether
hitherto
such
items
had
escaped
my
attention
or
had
seemed
to
demand
no
particular
notice
or
whether
they
now
became
increasingly
numerous
i
was
unable
to
determine
one
evening
some
little
time
after
our
sojourn
in
norfolk
in
glancing
through
a
number
of
papers
which
i
had
brought
in
with
me
i
chanced
upon
no
fewer
than
four
items
of
news
bearing
more
or
less
directly
upon
the
grim
business
which
engaged
my
friend
and
i
no
white
man
i
honestly
believe
appreciates
the
unemotional
cruelty
of
the
chinese
throughout
the
time
that
remained
in
england
the
press
preserved
a
uniform
silence
upon
the
subject
of
his
existence
this
was
due
to
nayland
smith
but
as
a
result
i
feel
assured
that
my
account
of
the
chinaman
deeds
will
in
many
quarters
meet
with
an
incredulous
reception
i
had
been
at
work
earlier
in
the
evening
upon
the
opening
chapters
of
this
chronicle
and
i
had
realized
how
difficult
it
would
be
for
my
reader
amid
secure
and
cozy
surroundings
to
credit
any
human
being
with
a
callous
villainy
great
enough
to
conceive
and
to
put
into
execution
such
a
death
pest
as
that
directed
against
sir
crichton
davey
one
would
expect
god
worst
man
to
shrink
from
employing
against
however
vile
an
enemy
such
an
instrument
as
the
zayat
kiss
so
thinking
my
eye
was
caught
by
the
following
express
correspondent
new
york
secret
service
men
of
the
united
states
government
are
searching
the
south
sea
islands
for
a
certain
hawaiian
from
the
island
of
maui
who
it
is
believed
has
been
selling
poisonous
scorpions
to
chinese
in
honolulu
anxious
to
get
rid
of
their
children
infanticide
by
scorpion
and
otherwise
among
the
chinese
has
increased
so
terribly
that
the
authorities
have
started
a
searching
inquiry
which
has
led
to
the
hunt
for
the
scorpion
dealer
of
maui
practically
all
the
babies
that
die
mysteriously
are
unwanted
girls
and
in
nearly
every
case
the
parents
promptly
ascribe
the
death
to
the
bite
of
a
scorpion
and
are
ready
to
produce
some
more
or
less
poisonous
insect
in
support
of
the
statement
the
authorities
have
no
doubt
that
infanticide
by
scorpion
bite
is
a
growing
practice
and
orders
have
been
given
to
hunt
down
the
scorpion
dealer
at
any
cost
is
it
any
matter
for
wonder
that
such
a
people
had
produced
a
i
pasted
the
cutting
into
a
determined
that
if
i
lived
to
publish
my
account
of
those
days
i
would
quote
it
therein
as
casting
a
sidelight
upon
chinese
character
a
reuter
message
to
the
globe
and
a
paragraph
in
the
star
also
furnished
work
for
my
scissors
here
were
evidences
of
the
unrest
the
secret
turmoil
which
manifested
itself
so
far
from
its
center
as
peaceful
england
in
the
person
of
the
sinister
doctor
hong
kong
friday
li
hon
hung
the
chinaman
who
fired
at
the
governor
yesterday
was
charged
before
the
magistrate
with
shooting
at
him
with
intent
to
kill
which
is
equivalent
to
attempted
murder
the
prisoner
who
was
not
defended
pleaded
guilty
the
assistant
crown
solicitor
who
prosecuted
asked
for
a
remand
until
monday
which
was
granted
snapshots
taken
by
the
spectators
of
the
outrage
yesterday
disclosed
the
presence
of
an
accomplice
also
armed
with
a
revolver
it
is
reported
that
this
man
who
was
arrested
last
night
was
in
possession
of
incriminating
documentary
evidence
later
examination
of
the
documents
found
on
li
hon
hung
accomplice
has
disclosed
the
fact
that
both
men
were
well
financed
by
the
canton
triad
society
the
directors
of
which
had
enjoined
the
assassination
of
sir
or
the
colonial
secretary
in
a
report
prepared
by
the
accomplice
for
dispatch
to
canton
also
found
on
his
person
he
expressed
regret
that
the
attempt
had
reuter
it
is
officially
reported
in
petersburg
that
a
force
of
chinese
soldiers
and
villagers
surrounded
the
house
of
a
russian
subject
named
said
effendi
near
khotan
in
chinese
turkestan
they
fired
at
the
house
and
set
it
in
flames
there
were
in
the
house
about
russians
many
of
whom
were
killed
the
russian
government
has
instructed
its
minister
at
peking
to
make
the
most
vigorous
representations
on
the
reuter
finally
in
a
personal
column
i
found
the
following
have
abandoned
eltham
i
had
just
pasted
it
into
my
book
when
nayland
smith
came
in
and
threw
himself
into
an
facing
me
across
the
table
i
showed
him
the
cutting
i
am
glad
for
eltham
sake
and
for
the
girl
was
his
comment
but
it
marks
another
victory
for
just
heaven
why
is
retribution
delayed
smith
darkly
tanned
face
had
grown
leaner
than
ever
since
he
had
begun
his
fight
with
the
most
uncanny
opponent
i
suppose
against
whom
a
man
ever
had
pitted
himself
he
stood
up
and
began
restlessly
to
pace
the
room
furiously
stuffing
tobacco
into
his
briar
i
have
seen
sir
lionel
barton
he
said
abruptly
and
to
put
the
whole
thing
in
a
nutshell
he
has
laughed
at
me
during
the
months
that
i
have
been
wondering
where
he
had
gone
to
he
has
been
somewhere
in
egypt
he
certainly
bears
a
charmed
life
for
on
the
evidence
of
his
letter
to
the
times
he
has
seen
things
in
tibet
which
would
have
the
west
blind
to
in
fact
i
think
he
has
found
a
new
keyhole
to
the
gate
of
the
indian
empire
long
ago
we
had
placed
the
name
of
sir
lionel
barton
upon
the
list
of
those
whose
lives
stood
between
and
the
attainment
of
his
end
orientalist
and
explorer
the
fearless
traveler
who
first
had
penetrated
to
lhassa
who
thrice
as
a
pilgrim
had
entered
forbidden
mecca
he
now
had
turned
his
attention
again
to
tibet
thereby
signing
his
own
that
he
has
reached
england
alive
is
a
hopeful
sign
i
suggested
smith
shook
his
head
and
lighted
the
blackened
briar
england
at
present
is
the
web
he
replied
the
spider
will
be
waiting
petrie
i
sometimes
despair
sir
lionel
is
an
impossible
man
to
shepherd
you
ought
to
see
his
house
at
finchley
a
low
squat
place
completely
hemmed
in
by
trees
damp
as
a
swamp
smells
like
a
jungle
everything
he
only
arrived
and
he
is
working
and
eating
and
sleeping
i
expect
in
a
study
that
looks
like
an
earthquake
at
sotheby
the
rest
of
the
house
is
half
a
menagerie
and
half
a
circus
he
has
a
bedouin
groom
a
chinese
and
heaven
only
knows
what
other
strange
people
chinese
yes
i
saw
him
a
squinting
cantonese
he
calls
kwee
i
do
like
him
also
there
is
a
secretary
known
as
strozza
who
has
an
unpleasant
face
he
is
a
fine
linguist
i
understand
and
is
engaged
upon
the
spanish
notes
for
barton
forthcoming
book
on
the
mayapan
temples
by
the
way
all
sir
lionel
baggage
disappeared
from
the
including
his
tibetan
notes
significant
of
course
but
he
argues
that
he
has
crossed
tibet
from
the
to
the
himalayas
without
being
assassinated
and
therefore
that
it
is
unlikely
he
will
meet
with
that
fate
in
london
i
left
him
dictating
the
book
from
memory
at
the
rate
of
about
two
hundred
words
a
minute
he
is
wasting
no
time
wasting
time
in
addition
to
the
yucatan
book
and
the
work
on
tibet
he
has
to
read
a
paper
at
the
institute
next
week
about
some
tomb
he
has
unearthed
in
egypt
as
i
came
away
a
van
drove
up
from
the
docks
and
a
couple
of
fellows
delivered
a
sarcophagus
as
big
as
a
boat
it
is
unique
according
to
sir
lionel
and
will
go
to
the
british
museum
after
he
has
examined
it
the
man
crams
six
months
work
into
six
weeks
then
he
is
off
again
what
do
you
propose
to
do
what
can
i
do
i
know
that
will
make
an
attempt
upon
him
i
can
not
doubt
it
ugh
that
house
gave
me
the
shudders
no
sunlight
i
swear
petrie
can
ever
penetrate
to
the
rooms
and
when
i
arrived
this
afternoon
clouds
of
gnats
floated
like
motes
wherever
a
stray
beam
filtered
through
the
trees
of
the
avenue
there
a
steamy
smell
about
the
place
that
is
almost
malarious
and
the
whole
of
the
west
front
is
covered
with
a
sort
of
which
he
has
imported
at
some
time
or
other
it
has
a
close
exotic
perfume
that
is
quite
in
the
picture
i
tell
you
the
place
was
made
for
murder
have
you
taken
any
precautions
i
called
at
scotland
yard
and
sent
a
man
down
to
watch
the
house
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
helplessly
what
is
sir
lionel
like
a
madman
petrie
a
tall
massive
man
wearing
a
dirty
of
neutral
color
a
man
with
untidy
gray
hair
and
a
bristling
mustache
keen
blue
eyes
and
a
brown
skin
who
wears
a
short
beard
or
rarely
shaves
i
do
know
which
i
left
him
striding
about
among
the
thousand
and
one
curiosities
of
that
incredible
room
picking
his
way
through
his
antique
furniture
works
of
reference
manuscripts
mummies
spears
pottery
and
what
not
sometimes
kicking
a
book
from
his
course
or
stumbling
over
a
stuffed
crocodile
or
a
mexican
mask
alternately
dictating
and
conversing
phew
for
some
time
we
were
silent
smith
i
said
we
are
making
no
headway
in
this
business
with
all
the
forces
arrayed
against
him
still
eludes
us
still
pursues
his
devilish
inscrutable
way
nayland
smith
nodded
and
we
do
know
all
he
said
we
mark
such
and
such
a
man
as
one
alive
to
the
yellow
peril
and
we
warn
him
if
we
have
time
perhaps
he
escapes
perhaps
he
does
not
but
what
do
we
know
petrie
of
those
others
who
may
die
every
week
by
his
murderous
agency
we
can
not
know
everyone
who
has
read
the
riddle
of
china
i
never
see
a
report
of
someone
found
drowned
of
an
apparent
suicide
of
a
sudden
though
seemingly
natural
death
without
wondering
i
tell
you
is
omnipresent
his
tentacles
embrace
everything
i
said
that
sir
lionel
must
bear
a
charmed
life
the
fact
that
we
are
alive
is
a
miracle
he
glanced
at
his
watch
nearly
eleven
he
said
but
sleep
seems
a
waste
of
time
apart
from
its
dangers
we
heard
a
bell
ring
a
few
moments
later
followed
a
knock
at
the
room
door
come
in
i
cried
a
girl
entered
with
a
telegram
addressed
to
smith
his
jaw
looked
very
square
in
the
lamplight
and
his
eyes
shone
like
steel
as
he
took
it
from
her
and
opened
the
envelope
he
glanced
at
the
form
stood
up
and
passed
it
to
me
reaching
for
his
hat
which
lay
upon
my
god
help
us
petrie
he
said
this
was
the
message
sir
lionel
barton
murdered
meet
me
at
his
house
at
weymouth
inspector
chapter
xi
although
we
avoided
all
unnecessary
delay
it
was
close
upon
midnight
when
our
cab
swung
round
into
a
darkly
shadowed
avenue
at
the
farther
end
of
which
as
seen
through
a
tunnel
the
moonlight
glittered
upon
the
windows
of
rowan
house
sir
lionel
barton
home
stepping
out
before
the
porch
of
the
long
squat
building
i
saw
that
it
was
banked
in
as
smith
had
said
by
trees
and
shrubs
the
facade
showed
mantled
in
the
strange
exotic
creeper
which
he
had
mentioned
and
the
air
was
pungent
with
an
odor
of
decaying
vegetation
with
which
mingled
the
heavy
perfume
of
the
little
nocturnal
red
flowers
which
bloomed
luxuriantly
upon
the
creeper
the
place
looked
a
veritable
wilderness
and
when
we
were
admitted
to
the
hall
by
inspector
weymouth
i
saw
that
the
interior
was
in
keeping
with
the
exterior
for
the
hall
was
constructed
from
the
model
of
some
apartment
in
an
assyrian
temple
and
the
squat
columns
the
low
seats
the
hangings
all
were
eloquent
of
neglect
being
thickly
the
musty
smell
too
was
almost
as
pronounced
here
as
outside
beneath
the
trees
to
a
library
whose
contents
overflowed
in
many
literary
torrents
upon
the
floor
the
detective
conducted
us
good
heavens
i
cried
what
that
something
leaped
from
the
top
of
the
bookcase
ambled
silently
across
the
littered
carpet
and
passed
from
the
library
like
a
golden
streak
i
stood
looking
after
it
with
startled
eyes
inspector
weymouth
laughed
dryly
it
a
young
puma
or
a
or
something
doctor
he
said
this
house
is
full
of
surprises
and
mysteries
his
voice
was
not
quite
steady
i
thought
and
he
carefully
closed
the
door
ere
proceeding
further
where
is
he
asked
nayland
smith
harshly
how
was
it
done
weymouth
sat
down
and
lighted
a
cigar
which
i
offered
him
i
thought
you
would
like
to
hear
what
led
up
to
it
so
far
as
we
know
before
seeing
him
smith
nodded
well
continued
the
inspector
the
man
you
arranged
to
send
down
from
the
yard
got
here
all
right
and
took
up
a
post
in
the
road
outside
where
he
could
command
a
good
view
of
the
gates
he
saw
and
heard
nothing
until
going
on
for
ten
when
a
young
lady
turned
up
and
went
in
a
young
lady
miss
edmonds
sir
lionel
shorthand
typist
she
had
found
after
getting
home
that
her
bag
with
her
purse
in
was
missing
and
she
came
back
to
see
if
she
had
left
it
here
she
gave
the
alarm
my
man
heard
the
row
from
the
road
and
came
in
then
he
ran
out
and
rang
us
up
i
immediately
wired
for
you
he
heard
the
row
you
say
what
row
miss
edmonds
went
into
violent
hysterics
smith
was
pacing
the
room
now
in
tense
excitement
describe
what
he
saw
when
he
came
in
he
saw
a
negro
footman
there
is
an
englishman
in
the
house
trying
to
pacify
the
girl
out
in
the
hall
yonder
and
a
malay
and
another
colored
man
beating
their
foreheads
and
howling
there
was
no
sense
to
be
got
out
of
any
of
them
so
he
started
to
investigate
for
himself
he
had
taken
the
bearings
of
the
place
earlier
in
the
evening
and
from
the
light
in
a
window
on
the
ground
floor
had
located
the
study
so
he
set
out
to
look
for
the
door
when
he
found
it
it
was
locked
from
the
inside
well
he
went
out
and
round
to
the
window
there
no
blind
and
from
the
shrubbery
you
can
see
into
the
known
as
the
study
he
looked
in
as
apparently
miss
edmonds
had
done
before
him
what
he
saw
accounted
for
her
hysterics
both
smith
and
i
were
hanging
upon
his
words
all
amongst
the
rubbish
on
the
floor
a
big
egyptian
mummy
case
was
lying
on
its
side
and
face
downwards
with
his
arms
thrown
across
it
lay
sir
lionel
barton
my
god
yes
go
on
there
was
only
a
shaded
alight
and
it
stood
on
a
chair
shining
right
down
on
him
it
made
a
patch
of
light
on
the
floor
you
understand
the
inspector
indicated
its
extent
with
his
hands
well
as
the
man
smashed
the
glass
and
got
the
window
open
and
was
just
climbing
in
he
saw
something
else
so
he
says
he
paused
what
did
he
see
demanded
smith
shortly
a
sort
of
green
mist
sir
he
says
it
seemed
to
be
alive
it
moved
over
the
floor
about
a
foot
from
the
ground
going
away
from
him
and
towards
a
curtain
at
the
other
end
of
the
study
nayland
smith
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
speaker
where
did
he
first
see
this
green
mist
he
says
smith
that
he
thinks
it
came
from
the
mummy
case
yes
go
on
it
is
to
his
credit
that
he
climbed
into
the
room
after
seeing
a
thing
like
that
he
did
he
turned
the
body
over
and
sir
lionel
looked
horrible
he
was
quite
dead
then
croxted
that
the
name
went
over
to
this
curtain
there
was
a
glass
door
shut
he
opened
it
and
it
gave
on
a
conservatory
a
place
stacked
from
the
tiled
floor
to
the
glass
roof
with
more
rubbish
it
was
dark
inside
but
enough
light
came
from
the
study
it
really
a
by
the
way
as
he
turned
all
the
lamps
on
to
give
him
another
glimpse
of
this
green
crawling
mist
there
are
three
steps
to
go
down
on
the
steps
lay
a
dead
chinaman
a
dead
chinaman
a
dead
chinaman
doctor
seen
them
rapped
smith
yes
a
local
man
he
was
out
of
his
depth
i
could
see
contradicted
himself
three
times
but
there
no
need
for
another
opinion
until
we
get
the
coroner
and
croxted
croxted
was
taken
ill
smith
and
had
to
be
sent
home
in
a
cab
what
ails
him
weymouth
raised
his
eyebrows
and
carefully
knocked
the
ash
from
his
cigar
he
held
out
until
i
came
gave
me
the
story
and
then
fainted
right
away
he
said
that
something
in
the
conservatory
seemed
to
get
him
by
the
throat
did
he
mean
that
literally
i
could
say
we
had
to
send
the
girl
home
too
of
course
nayland
smith
was
pulling
thoughtfully
at
the
lobe
of
his
left
ear
got
any
theory
he
jerked
weymouth
shrugged
his
shoulders
not
one
that
includes
the
green
mist
he
said
shall
we
go
in
now
we
crossed
the
assyrian
hall
where
the
members
of
that
strange
household
were
gathered
in
a
group
they
numbered
four
two
of
them
were
negroes
and
two
easterns
of
some
kind
i
missed
the
chinaman
kwee
of
whom
smith
had
spoken
and
the
italian
secretary
and
from
the
way
in
which
my
friend
peered
about
the
shadows
of
the
hall
i
divined
that
he
too
wondered
at
their
absence
we
entered
sir
lionel
study
an
apartment
which
i
despair
of
describing
nayland
smith
words
an
earthquake
at
sotheby
leaped
to
my
mind
at
once
for
the
place
was
simply
stacked
with
curious
litter
loot
of
africa
mexico
and
persia
in
a
clearing
by
the
hearth
a
gas
stove
stood
upon
a
and
about
it
lay
a
number
of
utensils
for
camp
cookery
the
odor
of
rotting
vegetation
mingled
with
the
insistent
perfume
of
the
strange
flowers
was
borne
in
through
the
open
window
in
the
center
of
the
floor
beside
an
overturned
sarcophagus
lay
a
figure
in
a
face
downwards
and
arms
thrust
forward
and
over
the
side
of
the
ancient
egyptian
mummy
case
my
friend
advanced
and
knelt
beside
the
dead
man
good
god
smith
sprang
upright
and
turned
with
an
extraordinary
expression
to
inspector
weymouth
you
do
not
know
sir
lionel
barton
by
sight
he
rapped
no
began
weymouth
but
this
is
not
sir
lionel
this
is
strozza
the
secretary
what
shouted
weymouth
where
is
the
other
the
chinaman
quick
cried
smith
i
have
had
him
left
where
he
was
found
on
the
conservatory
steps
said
the
inspector
smith
ran
across
the
room
to
where
beyond
the
open
door
a
glimpse
might
be
obtained
of
curiosities
holding
back
the
curtain
to
allow
more
light
to
penetrate
he
bent
forward
over
a
figure
which
lay
upon
the
steps
below
it
is
he
cried
aloud
it
is
sir
lionel
servant
kwee
weymouth
and
i
looked
at
one
another
across
the
body
of
the
italian
then
our
eyes
turned
together
to
where
my
friend
stood
over
the
dead
chinaman
a
breeze
whispered
through
the
leaves
a
great
wave
of
exotic
perfume
swept
from
the
open
window
towards
the
curtained
doorway
it
was
a
breath
of
the
east
that
stretched
out
a
yellow
hand
to
the
west
it
was
symbolic
of
the
subtle
intangible
power
manifested
in
as
nayland
smith
lean
agile
bronzed
with
the
suns
of
burma
was
symbolic
of
the
clean
british
efficiency
which
sought
to
combat
the
insidious
enemy
one
thing
is
evident
said
smith
no
one
in
the
house
strozza
excepted
knew
that
sir
lionel
was
absent
how
do
you
arrive
at
that
asked
weymouth
the
servants
in
the
hall
are
bewailing
him
as
dead
if
they
had
seen
him
go
out
they
would
know
that
it
must
be
someone
else
who
lies
here
what
about
the
chinaman
since
there
is
no
other
means
of
entrance
to
the
conservatory
save
through
the
study
kwee
must
have
hidden
himself
there
at
some
time
when
his
master
was
absent
from
the
room
croxted
found
the
communicating
door
closed
what
killed
the
chinaman
both
miss
edmonds
and
croxted
found
the
study
door
locked
from
the
inside
what
killed
strozza
retorted
smith
you
will
have
noted
continued
the
inspector
that
the
secretary
is
wearing
sir
lionel
it
was
seeing
him
in
that
as
she
looked
in
at
the
window
which
led
miss
edmonds
to
mistake
him
for
her
employer
and
consequently
to
put
us
on
the
wrong
scent
he
wore
it
in
order
that
anybody
looking
in
at
the
window
would
be
sure
to
make
that
mistake
rapped
smith
why
i
asked
because
he
came
here
for
a
felonious
purpose
see
smith
stooped
and
took
up
several
tools
from
the
litter
on
the
floor
there
lies
the
lid
he
came
to
open
the
sarcophagus
it
contained
the
mummy
of
some
notable
person
who
flourished
under
meneptah
ii
and
sir
lionel
told
me
that
a
number
of
valuable
ornaments
and
jewels
probably
were
secreted
amongst
the
wrappings
he
proposed
to
open
the
thing
and
to
submit
the
entire
contents
to
examination
he
evidently
changed
his
mind
fortunately
for
himself
i
ran
my
fingers
through
my
hair
in
perplexity
then
what
has
become
of
the
mummy
nayland
smith
laughed
dryly
it
has
vanished
in
the
form
of
a
green
vapor
apparently
he
said
look
at
strozza
face
he
turned
the
body
over
and
used
as
i
was
to
such
spectacles
the
contorted
features
of
the
italian
filled
me
with
horror
so
suggestive
were
they
of
a
death
more
than
ordinarily
violent
i
pulled
aside
the
and
searched
the
body
for
marks
but
failed
to
find
any
nayland
smith
crossed
the
room
and
assisted
by
the
detective
carried
kwee
the
chinaman
into
the
study
and
laid
him
fully
in
the
light
his
puckered
yellow
face
presented
a
sight
even
more
awful
than
the
other
and
his
blue
lips
were
drawn
back
exposing
both
upper
and
lower
teeth
there
were
no
marks
of
violence
but
his
limbs
like
strozza
had
been
tortured
during
his
mortal
struggles
into
unnatural
postures
the
breeze
was
growing
higher
and
pungent
from
the
damp
shrubbery
bearing
too
the
oppressive
sweetness
of
the
creeping
plant
swept
constantly
through
the
open
window
inspector
weymouth
carefully
relighted
his
cigar
i
with
you
this
far
smith
he
said
strozza
knowing
sir
lionel
to
be
absent
locked
himself
in
here
to
rifle
the
mummy
case
for
croxted
entering
by
way
of
the
window
found
the
key
on
the
inside
strozza
did
know
that
the
chinaman
was
hidden
in
the
conservatory
and
kwee
did
not
dare
to
show
himself
because
he
too
was
there
for
some
mysterious
reason
of
his
own
interrupted
smith
having
got
the
lid
off
something
somebody
suppose
we
say
the
mummy
weymouth
laughed
uneasily
well
sir
something
that
vanished
from
a
locked
room
without
opening
the
door
or
the
window
killed
strozza
and
something
which
having
killed
strozza
next
killed
the
chinaman
apparently
without
troubling
to
open
the
door
behind
which
he
lay
concealed
smith
continued
for
once
in
a
way
inspector
has
employed
an
ally
which
even
his
giant
will
was
incapable
entirely
to
subjugate
what
blind
force
what
terrific
agent
of
death
had
he
confined
in
that
sarcophagus
you
think
this
is
the
work
of
i
said
if
you
are
correct
his
power
indeed
is
more
than
human
something
in
my
voice
i
suppose
brought
smith
right
about
he
surveyed
me
curiously
can
you
doubt
it
the
presence
of
a
concealed
chinaman
surely
is
sufficient
kwee
i
feel
assured
was
one
of
the
murder
group
though
probably
he
had
only
recently
entered
that
mysterious
service
he
is
unarmed
or
i
should
feel
disposed
to
think
that
his
part
was
to
assassinate
sir
lionel
whilst
unsuspecting
the
presence
of
a
hidden
enemy
he
was
at
work
here
strozza
opening
the
sarcophagus
clearly
spoiled
the
scheme
and
led
to
the
death
of
a
servant
of
yes
i
am
at
a
loss
to
account
for
that
do
you
think
that
the
sarcophagus
entered
into
the
scheme
smith
my
friend
looked
at
me
in
evident
perplexity
you
mean
that
its
arrival
at
the
time
when
a
creature
of
the
doctor
kwee
was
concealed
here
may
have
been
a
coincidence
i
nodded
and
smith
bent
over
the
sarcophagus
curiously
examining
the
garish
paintings
with
which
it
was
decorated
inside
and
out
it
lay
sideways
upon
the
floor
and
seizing
it
by
its
edge
he
turned
it
over
heavy
he
muttered
but
strozza
must
have
capsized
it
as
he
fell
he
would
not
have
laid
it
on
its
side
to
remove
the
lid
hallo
he
bent
farther
forward
catching
at
a
piece
of
twine
and
out
of
the
mummy
case
pulled
a
rubber
stopper
or
cork
this
was
stuck
in
a
hole
level
with
the
floor
of
the
thing
he
said
ugh
it
has
a
disgusting
smell
i
took
it
from
his
hands
and
was
about
to
examine
it
when
a
loud
voice
sounded
outside
in
the
hall
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
a
big
man
who
despite
the
warmth
of
the
weather
wore
a
overcoat
rushed
impetuously
into
the
room
sir
lionel
cried
smith
eagerly
i
warned
you
and
see
you
have
had
a
very
narrow
escape
sir
lionel
barton
glanced
at
what
lay
upon
the
floor
then
from
smith
to
myself
and
from
me
to
inspector
weymouth
he
dropped
into
one
of
the
few
chairs
unstacked
with
books
smith
he
said
with
emotion
what
does
this
mean
tell
me
quickly
in
brief
terms
smith
detailed
the
happenings
of
the
night
or
so
much
as
he
knew
of
them
sir
lionel
barton
listened
sitting
quite
still
the
while
an
unusual
repose
in
a
man
of
such
evidently
tremendous
nervous
activity
he
came
for
the
jewels
he
said
slowly
when
smith
was
finished
and
his
eyes
turned
to
the
body
of
the
dead
italian
i
was
wrong
to
submit
him
to
the
temptation
god
knows
what
kwee
was
doing
in
hiding
perhaps
he
had
come
to
murder
me
as
you
surmise
smith
though
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
but
i
do
think
this
is
the
handiwork
of
your
chinese
doctor
he
fixed
his
gaze
upon
the
sarcophagus
smith
stared
at
him
in
surprise
what
do
you
mean
sir
lionel
the
famous
traveler
continued
to
look
towards
the
sarcophagus
with
something
in
his
blue
eyes
that
might
have
been
dread
i
received
a
wire
from
professor
rembold
he
continued
you
were
correct
in
supposing
that
no
one
but
strozza
knew
of
my
absence
i
dressed
hurriedly
and
met
the
professor
at
the
traveler
he
knew
that
i
was
to
read
a
paper
next
week
upon
again
he
looked
toward
the
mummy
case
the
tomb
of
mekara
and
he
knew
that
the
sarcophagus
had
been
brought
untouched
to
england
he
begged
me
not
to
open
it
nayland
smith
was
studying
the
speaker
face
what
reason
did
he
give
for
so
extraordinary
a
request
he
asked
sir
lionel
barton
hesitated
one
he
replied
at
last
which
amused
me
at
the
time
i
must
inform
you
that
mekara
whose
tomb
my
agent
had
discovered
during
my
absence
in
tibet
and
to
enter
which
i
broke
my
return
journey
to
alexandria
was
a
high
priest
and
first
prophet
of
amen
under
the
pharaoh
of
the
exodus
in
short
one
of
the
magicians
who
contested
in
magic
arts
with
moses
i
thought
the
discovery
unique
until
professor
rembold
furnished
me
with
some
curious
particulars
respecting
the
death
of
page
le
roi
the
french
egyptologist
particulars
new
to
me
we
listened
in
growing
surprise
scarcely
knowing
to
what
this
tended
le
roi
continued
barton
discovered
but
kept
secret
the
tomb
of
amenti
another
of
this
particular
brotherhood
it
appears
that
he
opened
the
mummy
case
on
the
spot
these
priests
were
of
royal
line
and
are
buried
in
the
valley
of
his
fellah
and
arab
servants
deserted
him
for
some
reason
on
seeing
the
mummy
case
and
he
was
found
dead
apparently
strangled
beside
it
the
matter
was
hushed
up
by
the
egyptian
government
rembold
could
not
explain
why
but
he
begged
of
me
not
to
open
the
sarcophagus
of
mekara
a
silence
fell
the
strange
facts
regarding
the
sudden
death
of
page
le
roi
which
i
now
heard
for
the
first
time
had
impressed
me
unpleasantly
coming
from
a
man
of
sir
lionel
barton
experience
and
reputation
how
long
had
it
lain
in
the
docks
jerked
smith
for
two
days
i
believe
i
am
not
a
superstitious
man
smith
but
neither
is
professor
rembold
and
now
that
i
know
the
facts
respecting
page
le
roi
i
can
find
it
in
my
heart
to
thank
god
that
i
did
not
see
whatever
came
out
of
that
sarcophagus
nayland
smith
stared
him
hard
in
the
face
i
am
glad
you
did
not
sir
lionel
he
said
for
whatever
the
priest
mekara
has
to
do
with
the
matter
by
means
of
his
sarcophagus
has
made
his
first
attempt
upon
your
life
he
has
failed
but
i
hope
you
will
accompany
me
from
here
to
a
hotel
he
will
not
fail
twice
chapter
xii
it
was
the
night
following
that
of
the
double
tragedy
at
rowan
house
nayland
smith
with
inspector
weymouth
was
engaged
in
some
mysterious
inquiry
at
the
docks
and
i
had
remained
at
home
to
resume
my
strange
chronicle
and
why
should
i
not
confess
it
my
memories
had
frightened
me
i
was
arranging
my
notes
respecting
the
case
of
sir
lionel
barton
they
were
hopelessly
incomplete
for
instance
i
had
jotted
down
the
following
queries
did
any
true
parallel
exist
between
the
death
of
page
le
roi
and
the
death
of
kwee
the
chinaman
and
of
strozza
what
had
become
of
the
mummy
of
mekara
how
had
the
murderer
escaped
from
a
locked
room
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
rubber
stopper
why
was
kwee
hiding
in
the
conservatory
was
the
green
mist
a
mere
subjective
hallucination
a
figment
of
imagination
or
had
he
actually
seen
it
until
these
questions
were
satisfactorily
answered
further
progress
was
impossible
nayland
smith
frankly
admitted
that
he
was
out
of
his
depth
it
looks
on
the
face
of
it
more
like
a
case
for
the
psychical
research
people
than
for
a
plain
civil
servant
lately
of
mandalay
he
had
said
only
that
morning
sir
lionel
barton
really
believes
that
supernatural
agencies
were
brought
into
operation
by
the
opening
of
the
high
priest
coffin
for
my
part
even
if
i
believed
the
same
i
should
still
maintain
that
controlled
those
manifestations
but
reason
it
out
for
yourself
and
see
if
we
arrive
at
any
common
center
do
work
so
much
upon
the
datum
of
the
green
mist
but
keep
to
the
facts
which
are
established
i
commenced
to
knock
out
my
pipe
in
the
then
paused
pipe
in
hand
the
house
was
quite
still
for
my
landlady
and
all
the
small
household
were
out
above
the
noise
of
the
passing
tramcar
i
thought
i
had
heard
the
hall
door
open
in
the
ensuing
silence
i
sat
and
listened
not
a
sound
stay
i
slipped
my
hand
into
the
table
drawer
took
out
my
revolver
and
stood
up
there
was
a
sound
someone
or
something
was
creeping
upstairs
in
the
dark
familiar
with
the
ghastly
media
employed
by
the
chinaman
i
was
seized
with
an
impulse
to
leap
to
the
door
shut
and
lock
it
but
the
rustling
sound
proceeded
now
from
immediately
outside
my
partially
opened
door
i
had
not
the
time
to
close
it
knowing
somewhat
of
the
horrors
at
the
command
of
i
had
not
the
courage
to
open
it
my
heart
leaping
wildly
and
my
eyes
upon
that
bar
of
darkness
with
its
gruesome
potentialities
i
waited
waited
for
whatever
was
to
come
perhaps
twelve
seconds
passed
in
silence
who
there
i
cried
answer
or
i
fire
ah
no
came
a
soft
voice
thrillingly
musical
put
it
down
that
pistol
quick
i
must
speak
to
you
the
door
was
pushed
open
and
there
entered
a
slim
figure
wrapped
in
a
hooded
cloak
my
hand
fell
and
i
stood
stricken
to
silence
looking
into
the
beautiful
dark
eyes
of
messenger
if
her
own
statement
could
be
credited
slave
on
two
occasions
this
girl
whose
association
with
the
doctor
was
one
of
the
most
profound
mysteries
of
the
case
had
risked
i
can
not
say
what
unnameable
punishment
perhaps
to
save
me
from
death
in
both
cases
from
a
terrible
death
for
what
was
she
come
now
her
lips
slightly
parted
she
stood
holding
her
cloak
about
her
and
watching
me
with
great
passionate
eyes
how
i
began
but
she
shook
her
head
impatiently
he
has
a
duplicate
key
of
the
house
door
was
her
amazing
statement
i
have
never
betrayed
a
secret
of
my
master
before
but
you
must
arrange
to
replace
the
lock
she
came
forward
and
rested
her
slim
hands
confidingly
upon
my
shoulders
i
have
come
again
to
ask
you
to
take
me
away
from
him
she
said
simply
and
she
lifted
her
face
to
me
her
words
struck
a
chord
in
my
heart
which
sang
with
strange
music
with
music
so
barbaric
that
frankly
i
blushed
to
find
it
harmony
have
i
said
that
she
was
beautiful
it
can
convey
no
faint
conception
of
her
with
her
pure
fair
skin
eyes
like
the
velvet
darkness
of
the
east
and
red
lips
so
tremulously
near
to
mine
she
was
the
most
seductively
lovely
creature
i
ever
had
looked
upon
in
that
electric
moment
my
heart
went
out
in
sympathy
to
every
man
who
had
bartered
honor
country
all
for
a
woman
kiss
i
will
see
that
you
are
placed
under
proper
protection
i
said
firmly
but
my
voice
was
not
quite
my
own
it
is
quite
absurd
to
talk
of
slavery
here
in
england
you
are
a
free
agent
or
you
could
not
be
here
now
can
not
control
your
actions
ah
she
cried
casting
back
her
head
scornfully
and
releasing
a
cloud
of
hair
through
whose
softness
gleamed
a
jeweled
no
he
can
not
do
you
know
what
it
means
to
have
been
a
slave
here
in
your
free
england
do
you
know
what
it
means
the
razzia
the
desert
journey
the
whips
of
the
drivers
the
house
of
the
dealer
the
shame
bah
how
beautiful
she
was
in
her
indignation
slavery
is
put
down
you
imagine
perhaps
you
do
not
believe
that
english
sovereigns
will
buy
a
galla
girl
who
is
brown
and
whisper
two
hundred
and
fifty
a
circassian
who
is
white
no
there
is
no
slavery
so
then
what
am
i
she
threw
open
her
cloak
and
it
is
a
literal
fact
that
i
rubbed
my
eyes
half
believing
that
i
dreamed
for
beneath
she
was
arrayed
in
gossamer
silk
which
more
than
indicated
the
perfect
lines
of
her
slim
shape
wore
a
jeweled
girdle
and
barbaric
ornaments
was
a
figure
fit
for
the
walled
gardens
of
stamboul
a
figure
amazing
incomprehensible
in
the
prosaic
setting
of
my
rooms
i
had
no
time
to
make
myself
an
english
miss
she
said
wrapping
her
cloak
quickly
about
her
you
see
me
as
i
am
her
garments
exhaled
a
faint
perfume
and
it
reminded
me
of
another
meeting
i
had
had
with
her
i
looked
into
the
challenging
eyes
your
request
is
but
a
pretense
i
said
why
do
you
keep
the
secrets
of
that
man
when
they
mean
death
to
so
many
death
i
have
seen
my
own
sister
die
of
fever
in
the
desert
seen
her
thrown
like
carrion
into
a
hole
in
the
sand
i
have
seen
men
flogged
until
they
prayed
for
death
as
a
boon
i
have
known
the
lash
myself
death
what
does
it
matter
she
shocked
me
inexpressibly
enveloped
in
her
cloak
again
and
with
only
her
slight
accent
to
betray
her
it
was
dreadful
to
hear
such
words
from
a
girl
who
save
for
her
singular
type
of
beauty
might
have
been
a
cultured
european
prove
then
that
you
really
wish
to
leave
this
man
service
tell
me
what
killed
strozza
and
the
chinaman
i
said
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
do
not
know
that
but
if
you
will
carry
me
off
she
clutched
me
nervously
so
that
i
am
helpless
lock
me
up
so
that
i
can
not
escape
beat
me
if
you
like
i
will
tell
you
all
i
do
know
while
he
is
my
master
i
will
never
betray
him
tear
me
from
him
by
force
do
you
understand
by
force
and
my
lips
will
be
sealed
no
longer
ah
but
you
do
not
understand
with
your
authorities
your
police
police
ah
i
have
said
enough
a
clock
across
the
common
began
to
strike
the
girl
started
and
laid
her
hands
upon
my
shoulders
again
there
were
tears
glittering
among
the
curved
black
lashes
you
do
not
understand
she
whispered
oh
will
you
never
understand
and
release
me
from
him
i
must
go
already
i
have
remained
too
long
listen
go
out
without
delay
remain
out
at
a
hotel
where
you
will
but
do
not
stay
here
and
nayland
smith
what
is
he
to
me
this
nayland
smith
ah
why
will
you
not
unseal
my
lips
you
are
in
danger
you
hear
me
in
danger
go
away
from
here
she
dropped
her
hands
and
ran
from
the
room
in
the
open
doorway
she
turned
stamping
her
foot
passionately
you
have
hands
and
arms
she
cried
and
yet
you
let
me
go
be
warned
then
fly
from
here
she
broke
off
with
something
that
sounded
like
a
sob
i
made
no
move
to
stay
her
this
beautiful
accomplice
of
the
i
heard
her
light
footsteps
pattering
down
the
stairs
i
heard
her
open
and
close
the
door
the
door
of
which
held
the
key
still
i
stood
where
she
had
parted
from
me
and
was
so
standing
when
a
key
grated
in
the
lock
and
nayland
smith
came
running
up
did
you
see
her
i
began
but
his
face
showed
that
he
had
not
done
so
and
rapidly
i
told
him
of
my
strange
visitor
of
her
words
of
her
warning
how
can
she
have
passed
through
london
in
that
costume
i
cried
in
bewilderment
where
can
she
have
come
from
smith
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
began
to
stuff
mixture
into
the
familiar
cracked
briar
she
might
have
traveled
in
a
car
or
in
a
cab
he
said
and
undoubtedly
she
came
direct
from
the
house
of
you
should
have
detained
her
petrie
it
is
the
third
time
we
have
had
that
woman
in
our
power
the
third
time
we
have
let
her
go
free
smith
i
replied
i
could
she
came
of
her
own
free
will
to
give
me
a
warning
she
disarms
me
because
you
can
see
she
is
in
love
with
you
he
suggested
and
burst
into
one
of
his
rare
laughs
when
the
angry
flush
rose
to
my
cheek
she
is
petrie
why
pretend
to
be
blind
to
it
you
do
know
the
oriental
mind
as
i
do
but
i
quite
understand
the
girl
position
she
fears
the
english
authorities
but
would
submit
to
capture
by
you
if
you
would
only
seize
her
by
the
hair
drag
her
to
some
cellar
hurl
her
down
and
stand
over
her
with
a
whip
she
would
tell
you
everything
she
knows
and
salve
her
strange
eastern
conscience
with
the
reflection
that
speech
was
forced
from
her
i
am
not
joking
it
is
so
i
assure
you
and
she
would
adore
you
for
your
savagery
deeming
you
forceful
and
strong
smith
i
said
be
serious
you
know
what
her
warning
meant
before
i
can
guess
what
it
means
now
he
rapped
hallo
someone
was
furiously
ringing
the
bell
no
one
at
home
said
my
friend
i
will
go
i
think
i
know
what
it
is
a
few
minutes
later
he
returned
carrying
a
large
square
package
from
weymouth
he
explained
by
district
messenger
i
left
him
behind
at
the
docks
and
he
arranged
to
forward
any
evidence
which
subsequently
he
found
this
will
be
fragments
of
the
mummy
what
you
think
the
mummy
was
abstracted
yes
at
the
docks
i
am
sure
of
it
and
somebody
else
was
in
the
sarcophagus
when
it
reached
rowan
house
a
sarcophagus
i
find
is
practically
airtight
so
that
the
use
of
the
rubber
stopper
becomes
evident
ventilation
how
this
person
killed
strozza
i
have
yet
to
learn
also
how
he
escaped
from
a
locked
room
and
what
about
the
green
mist
nayland
smith
spread
his
hands
in
a
characteristic
gesture
the
green
mist
petrie
can
be
explained
in
several
ways
remember
we
have
only
one
man
word
that
it
existed
it
is
at
best
a
confusing
datum
to
which
we
must
not
attach
a
factitious
importance
he
threw
the
wrappings
on
the
floor
and
tugged
at
a
twine
loop
in
the
lid
of
the
square
box
which
now
stood
upon
the
table
suddenly
the
lid
came
away
bringing
with
it
a
lead
lining
such
as
is
usual
in
this
lining
was
partially
attached
to
one
side
of
the
box
so
that
the
action
of
removing
the
lid
at
once
raised
and
tilted
it
then
happened
a
singular
thing
out
over
the
table
billowed
a
sort
of
cloud
an
oily
vapor
and
an
inspiration
it
was
nothing
less
born
of
a
memory
and
of
some
words
of
my
beautiful
visitor
came
to
me
run
smith
i
screamed
the
door
the
door
for
your
life
sent
that
box
i
threw
my
arms
round
him
as
he
bent
forward
the
moving
vapor
rose
almost
to
his
nostrils
i
dragged
him
back
and
all
but
pitched
him
out
on
to
the
landing
we
entered
my
bedroom
and
there
as
i
turned
on
the
light
i
saw
that
smith
tanned
face
was
unusually
drawn
and
touched
with
pallor
it
is
a
poisonous
gas
i
said
hoarsely
in
many
respects
identical
with
chlorine
but
having
unique
properties
which
prove
it
to
be
something
else
god
and
alone
know
what
it
is
the
fumes
of
chlorine
that
kill
the
men
in
the
bleaching
powder
works
we
have
been
blind
i
particularly
do
you
see
there
was
no
one
in
the
sarcophagus
smith
but
there
was
enough
of
that
fearful
stuff
to
have
suffocated
a
regiment
smith
clenched
his
fists
convulsively
my
god
he
said
how
can
i
hope
to
deal
with
the
author
of
such
a
scheme
i
see
the
whole
plan
he
did
not
reckon
on
the
mummy
case
being
overturned
and
kwee
part
was
to
remove
the
plug
with
the
aid
of
the
string
after
sir
lionel
had
been
suffocated
the
gas
i
take
it
is
heavier
than
air
chlorine
gas
has
a
specific
gravity
of
i
said
two
and
a
half
times
heavier
than
air
you
can
pour
it
from
jar
to
jar
like
a
liquid
if
you
are
wearing
a
chemist
mask
in
these
respects
this
stuff
appears
to
be
similar
the
points
of
difference
would
not
interest
you
the
sarcophagus
would
have
emptied
through
the
vent
and
the
gas
have
dispersed
with
no
clew
remaining
except
the
smell
i
did
smell
it
petrie
on
the
stopper
but
of
course
was
unfamiliar
with
it
you
may
remember
that
you
were
prevented
from
doing
so
by
the
arrival
of
sir
lionel
the
scent
of
those
infernal
flowers
must
partially
have
drowned
it
too
poor
misguided
strozza
inhaled
the
stuff
capsized
the
case
in
his
fall
and
all
the
gas
went
pouring
under
the
conservatory
door
and
down
the
steps
where
kwee
was
crouching
croxted
breaking
the
window
created
sufficient
draught
to
disperse
what
little
remained
it
will
have
settled
on
the
floor
now
i
will
go
and
open
both
windows
nayland
raised
his
haggard
face
he
evidently
made
more
than
was
necessary
to
dispatch
sir
lionel
barton
he
said
and
contemptuously
you
note
the
attitude
petrie
contemptuously
devoted
the
surplus
to
me
his
contempt
is
justified
i
am
a
child
striving
to
cope
with
a
mental
giant
it
is
by
no
wit
of
mine
that
scores
a
double
failure
chapter
xiii
i
will
tell
you
now
of
a
strange
dream
which
i
dreamed
and
of
the
stranger
things
to
which
i
awakened
since
out
of
a
blank
a
void
this
vision
burst
in
upon
my
mind
i
can
not
do
better
than
relate
it
without
preamble
it
was
thus
i
dreamed
that
i
lay
writhing
on
the
floor
in
agony
indescribable
my
veins
were
filled
with
liquid
fire
and
but
that
stygian
darkness
was
about
me
i
told
myself
that
i
must
have
seen
the
smoke
arising
from
my
burning
body
this
i
thought
was
death
then
a
cooling
shower
descended
upon
me
soaked
through
skin
and
tissue
to
the
tortured
arteries
and
quenched
the
fire
within
panting
but
free
from
pain
i
lay
exhausted
strength
gradually
returning
to
me
i
tried
to
rise
but
the
carpet
felt
so
singularly
soft
that
it
offered
me
no
foothold
i
waded
and
plunged
like
a
swimmer
treading
water
and
all
about
me
rose
impenetrable
walls
of
darkness
darkness
all
but
palpable
i
wondered
why
i
could
not
see
the
windows
the
horrible
idea
flashed
to
my
mind
that
i
was
become
blind
somehow
i
got
upon
my
feet
and
stood
swaying
dizzily
i
became
aware
of
a
heavy
perfume
and
knew
it
for
some
kind
of
incense
then
a
dim
light
was
born
at
an
immeasurable
distance
away
it
grew
steadily
in
brilliance
it
spread
like
a
stain
like
a
liquid
it
lapped
up
the
darkness
and
spread
throughout
the
room
but
this
was
not
my
room
nor
was
it
any
room
known
to
me
it
was
an
apartment
of
such
size
that
its
dimensions
filled
me
with
a
kind
of
awe
such
as
i
never
had
known
the
awe
of
walled
vastness
its
immense
extent
produced
a
sensation
of
sound
its
hugeness
had
a
distinct
note
tapestries
covered
the
four
walls
there
was
no
door
visible
these
tapestries
were
magnificently
figured
with
golden
dragons
and
as
the
serpentine
bodies
gleamed
and
shimmered
in
the
increasing
radiance
each
dragon
i
thought
intertwined
its
glittering
coils
more
closely
with
those
of
another
the
carpet
was
of
such
richness
that
i
stood
in
its
pile
and
this
too
was
fashioned
all
over
with
golden
dragons
and
they
seemed
to
glide
about
amid
the
shadows
of
the
design
stealthily
at
the
farther
end
of
the
hall
for
hall
it
was
a
huge
table
with
dragons
legs
stood
solitary
amid
the
luxuriance
of
the
carpet
it
bore
scintillating
globes
and
tubes
that
held
living
organisms
and
books
of
a
size
and
in
such
bindings
as
i
never
had
imagined
with
instruments
of
a
type
unknown
to
western
science
a
heterogeneous
litter
quite
indescribable
which
overflowed
on
to
the
floor
forming
an
amazing
oasis
in
a
desert
of
carpet
a
lamp
hung
above
this
table
suspended
by
golden
chains
from
the
ceiling
which
was
so
lofty
that
following
the
chains
upward
my
gaze
lost
itself
in
the
purple
shadows
above
in
a
chair
piled
high
with
cushions
a
man
sat
behind
this
table
the
light
from
the
swinging
lamp
fell
fully
upon
one
side
of
his
face
as
he
leaned
forward
amid
the
jumble
of
weird
objects
and
left
the
other
side
in
purplish
shadow
from
a
plain
brass
bowl
upon
the
corner
of
the
huge
table
smoke
writhed
aloft
and
at
times
partially
obscured
that
dreadful
face
from
the
instant
that
my
eyes
were
drawn
to
the
table
and
to
the
man
who
sat
there
neither
the
incredible
extent
of
the
room
nor
the
nightmare
fashion
of
its
mural
decorations
could
reclaim
my
attention
i
had
eyes
only
for
him
for
it
was
something
of
the
delirium
which
had
seemed
to
fill
my
veins
with
fire
to
people
the
walls
with
dragons
and
to
plunge
me
in
the
carpet
left
me
those
dreadful
filmed
green
eyes
acted
somewhat
like
a
cold
douche
i
knew
without
removing
my
gaze
from
the
still
face
that
the
walls
no
longer
lived
but
were
merely
draped
in
exquisite
chinese
dragon
tapestry
the
rich
carpet
beneath
my
feet
ceased
to
be
as
a
jungle
and
became
a
normal
carpet
extraordinarily
rich
but
merely
a
carpet
but
the
sense
of
vastness
nevertheless
remained
with
the
uncomfortable
knowledge
that
the
things
upon
the
table
and
overflowing
about
it
were
all
or
nearly
all
of
a
fashion
strange
to
me
then
and
almost
instantaneously
the
comparative
sanity
which
i
had
temporarily
experienced
began
to
slip
from
me
again
for
the
smoke
faintly
penciled
through
the
air
from
the
burning
perfume
on
the
table
grew
in
volume
thickened
and
wafted
towards
me
in
a
cloud
of
gray
horror
it
enveloped
me
clammily
dimly
through
its
oily
wreaths
i
saw
the
immobile
yellow
face
of
and
my
stupefied
brain
acclaimed
him
a
sorcerer
against
whom
unwittingly
we
had
pitted
our
poor
human
wits
the
green
eyes
showed
filmy
through
the
fog
an
intense
pain
shot
through
my
lower
limbs
and
catching
my
breath
i
looked
down
as
i
did
so
the
points
of
the
red
slippers
which
i
dreamed
that
i
wore
increased
in
length
curled
sinuously
upward
twined
about
my
throat
and
choked
the
breath
from
my
body
came
an
interval
and
then
a
dawning
like
consciousness
but
it
was
a
false
consciousness
since
it
brought
with
it
the
idea
that
my
head
lay
softly
pillowed
and
that
a
woman
hand
caressed
my
throbbing
forehead
confusedly
as
though
in
the
remote
past
i
recalled
a
kiss
and
the
recollection
thrilled
me
strangely
dreamily
content
i
lay
and
a
voice
stole
to
my
ears
they
are
killing
him
they
are
killing
him
oh
do
you
not
understand
in
my
dazed
condition
i
thought
that
it
was
i
who
had
died
and
that
this
musical
was
communicating
to
me
the
fact
of
my
own
dissolution
but
i
was
conscious
of
no
interest
in
the
matter
for
hours
and
hours
i
thought
that
soothing
hand
caressed
me
i
never
once
raised
my
heavy
lids
until
there
came
a
resounding
crash
that
seemed
to
set
my
very
bones
vibrating
a
metallic
jangling
crash
as
the
fall
of
heavy
chains
i
thought
that
then
i
half
opened
my
eyes
and
that
in
the
dimness
i
had
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
a
figure
clad
in
gossamer
silk
with
arms
covered
with
barbaric
bangles
and
slim
ankles
surrounded
by
gold
bands
the
girl
was
gone
even
as
i
told
myself
that
she
was
an
houri
and
that
i
though
a
christian
had
been
consigned
by
some
error
to
the
paradise
of
mohammed
then
a
complete
blank
my
head
throbbed
madly
my
brain
seemed
to
be
clogged
inert
and
though
my
first
feeble
movement
was
followed
by
the
rattle
of
a
chain
some
moments
more
elapsed
ere
i
realized
that
the
chain
was
fastened
to
a
steel
collar
that
the
steel
collar
was
clasped
about
my
neck
i
moaned
weakly
smith
i
muttered
where
are
you
smith
on
to
my
knees
i
struggled
and
the
pain
on
the
top
of
my
skull
grew
all
but
insupportable
it
was
coming
back
to
me
now
how
nayland
smith
and
i
had
started
for
the
hotel
to
warn
graham
guthrie
how
as
we
passed
up
the
steps
from
the
embankment
and
into
essex
street
we
saw
the
big
motor
standing
before
the
door
of
one
of
the
offices
i
could
recall
coming
up
level
with
the
car
a
modern
limousine
but
my
mind
retained
no
impression
of
our
having
passed
it
only
a
vague
memory
of
a
rush
of
footsteps
a
blow
then
my
vision
of
the
hall
of
dragons
and
now
this
real
awakening
to
a
worse
reality
groping
in
the
darkness
my
hands
touched
a
body
that
lay
close
beside
me
my
fingers
sought
and
found
the
throat
sought
and
found
the
steel
collar
about
it
smith
i
groaned
and
i
shook
the
still
form
smith
old
man
speak
to
me
smith
could
he
be
dead
was
this
the
end
of
his
gallant
fight
with
and
the
murder
group
if
so
what
did
the
future
hold
for
me
what
had
i
to
face
he
stirred
beneath
my
trembling
hands
thank
god
i
muttered
and
i
can
not
deny
that
my
joy
was
tainted
with
selfishness
for
waking
in
that
impenetrable
darkness
and
yet
obsessed
with
the
dream
i
had
dreamed
i
had
known
what
fear
meant
at
the
realization
that
alone
chained
i
must
face
the
dreadful
chinese
doctor
in
the
flesh
smith
began
incoherent
mutterings
look
out
petrie
he
has
us
at
last
oh
heavens
he
struggled
on
to
his
knees
clutching
at
my
hand
all
right
old
man
i
said
we
are
both
alive
so
let
be
thankful
a
moment
silence
a
groan
then
petrie
i
have
dragged
you
into
this
god
forgive
me
dry
up
smith
i
said
slowly
i
not
a
child
there
is
no
question
of
being
dragged
into
the
matter
i
here
and
if
i
can
be
of
any
use
i
glad
i
am
here
he
grasped
my
hand
there
were
two
chinese
in
european
clothes
lord
how
my
head
throbs
in
that
office
door
they
us
petrie
think
of
it
in
broad
daylight
within
hail
of
the
strand
we
were
rushed
into
the
car
and
it
was
all
over
before
his
voice
grew
faint
god
they
gave
me
an
awful
knock
why
have
we
been
spared
smith
do
you
think
he
is
saving
us
for
do
petrie
if
you
had
been
in
china
if
you
had
seen
what
i
have
seen
footsteps
sounded
on
the
flagged
passage
a
blade
of
light
crept
across
the
floor
towards
us
my
brain
was
growing
clearer
the
place
had
a
damp
earthen
smell
it
was
slimy
some
noisome
cellar
a
door
was
thrown
open
and
a
man
entered
carrying
a
lantern
its
light
showed
my
surmise
to
be
accurate
showed
the
walls
of
a
dungeon
some
fifteen
feet
square
shone
upon
the
long
yellow
robe
of
the
man
who
stood
watching
us
upon
the
malignant
intellectual
countenance
it
was
at
last
they
were
face
to
face
the
head
of
the
great
yellow
movement
and
the
man
who
fought
on
behalf
of
the
entire
white
race
how
can
i
paint
the
individual
who
now
stood
before
us
perhaps
the
greatest
genius
of
modern
times
of
him
it
had
been
fitly
said
that
he
had
a
brow
like
shakespeare
and
a
face
like
satan
something
serpentine
hypnotic
was
in
his
very
presence
smith
drew
one
sharp
breath
and
was
silent
together
chained
to
the
wall
two
mediaeval
captives
living
mockeries
of
our
boasted
modern
security
we
crouched
before
he
came
forward
with
an
indescribable
gait
yet
awkward
carrying
his
high
shoulders
almost
hunched
he
placed
the
lantern
in
a
niche
in
the
wall
never
turning
away
the
reptilian
gaze
of
those
eyes
which
must
haunt
my
dreams
forever
they
possessed
a
viridescence
which
hitherto
i
had
supposed
possible
only
in
the
eye
of
the
cat
and
the
film
intermittently
clouded
their
brightness
but
i
can
speak
of
them
no
more
i
had
never
supposed
prior
to
meeting
that
so
intense
a
force
of
malignancy
could
radiate
from
any
human
being
he
spoke
his
english
was
perfect
though
at
times
his
words
were
oddly
chosen
his
delivery
alternately
was
guttural
and
sibilant
smith
and
petrie
your
interference
with
my
plans
has
gone
too
far
i
have
seriously
turned
my
attention
to
you
he
displayed
his
teeth
small
and
evenly
separated
but
discolored
in
a
way
that
was
familiar
to
me
i
studied
his
eyes
with
a
new
professional
interest
which
even
the
extremity
of
our
danger
could
not
wholly
banish
their
greenness
seemed
to
be
of
the
iris
the
pupil
was
oddly
contracted
a
smith
leaned
his
back
against
the
wall
with
assumed
indifference
you
have
presumed
continued
to
meddle
with
a
poor
spiders
caught
in
the
wheels
of
the
inevitable
you
have
linked
my
name
with
the
futility
of
the
young
china
movement
the
name
of
smith
you
are
an
incompetent
meddler
i
despise
you
petrie
you
are
a
fool
i
am
sorry
for
you
he
rested
one
bony
hand
on
his
hip
narrowing
the
long
eyes
as
he
looked
down
on
us
the
purposeful
cruelty
of
the
man
was
inherent
it
was
entirely
untheatrical
still
smith
remained
silent
so
i
am
determined
to
remove
you
from
the
scene
of
your
blunders
added
opium
will
very
shortly
do
the
same
for
you
i
rapped
at
him
savagely
without
emotion
he
turned
the
narrowed
eyes
upon
me
that
is
a
matter
of
opinion
doctor
he
said
you
may
have
lacked
the
opportunities
which
have
been
mine
for
studying
that
subject
and
in
any
event
i
shall
not
be
privileged
to
enjoy
your
advice
in
the
future
you
will
not
long
outlive
me
i
replied
and
our
deaths
will
not
profit
you
incidentally
because
smith
foot
touched
mine
because
inquired
softly
ah
smith
is
so
prudent
he
is
thinking
that
i
have
files
he
pronounced
the
word
in
a
way
that
made
me
shudder
smith
has
seen
a
wire
jacket
have
you
ever
seen
a
wire
jacket
as
a
surgeon
its
functions
would
interest
you
i
stifled
a
cry
that
rose
to
my
lips
for
with
a
shrill
whistling
sound
a
small
shape
came
bounding
into
the
dimly
lit
vault
then
shot
upward
a
marmoset
landed
on
the
shoulder
of
and
peered
grotesquely
into
the
dreadful
yellow
face
the
doctor
raised
his
bony
hand
and
fondled
the
little
creature
crooning
to
it
one
of
my
pets
smith
he
said
suddenly
opening
his
eyes
fully
so
that
they
blazed
like
green
lamps
i
have
others
equally
useful
my
scorpions
have
you
met
my
scorpions
no
my
pythons
and
hamadryads
then
there
are
my
fungi
and
my
tiny
allies
the
bacilli
i
have
a
collection
in
my
laboratory
quite
unique
have
you
ever
visited
molokai
the
leper
island
doctor
no
but
nayland
smith
will
be
familiar
with
the
asylum
at
rangoon
and
we
must
not
forget
my
black
spiders
with
their
diamond
eyes
my
spiders
that
sit
in
the
dark
and
watch
then
leap
he
raised
his
lean
hands
so
that
the
sleeve
of
the
robe
fell
back
to
the
elbow
and
the
ape
dropped
chattering
to
the
floor
and
ran
from
the
cellar
o
god
of
cathay
he
cried
by
what
death
shall
these
die
these
miserable
ones
who
would
bind
thine
empire
which
is
boundless
like
some
priest
of
tezcat
he
stood
his
eyes
upraised
to
the
roof
his
lean
body
quivering
a
sight
to
shock
the
most
unimpressionable
mind
he
is
mad
i
whispered
to
smith
god
help
us
the
man
is
a
dangerous
homicidal
maniac
nayland
smith
tanned
face
was
very
drawn
but
he
shook
his
head
grimly
dangerous
yes
i
agree
he
muttered
his
existence
is
a
danger
to
the
entire
white
race
which
now
we
are
powerless
to
avert
recovered
himself
took
up
the
lantern
and
turning
abruptly
walked
to
the
door
with
his
awkward
yet
feline
gait
at
the
threshold
be
looked
back
you
would
have
warned
graham
guthrie
he
said
in
a
soft
voice
at
twelve
graham
guthrie
dies
smith
sat
silent
and
motionless
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
speaker
you
were
in
rangoon
in
continued
you
remember
the
call
from
somewhere
above
us
i
could
not
determine
the
exact
direction
came
a
low
wailing
cry
an
uncanny
thing
of
falling
cadences
which
in
that
dismal
vault
with
the
sinister
figure
at
the
door
seemed
to
pour
ice
into
my
veins
its
effect
upon
smith
was
truly
extraordinary
his
face
showed
grayly
in
the
faint
light
and
i
heard
him
draw
a
hissing
breath
through
clenched
teeth
it
calls
for
you
said
at
twelve
it
calls
for
graham
guthrie
the
door
closed
and
darkness
mantled
us
again
smith
i
said
what
was
that
the
horrors
about
us
were
playing
havoc
with
my
nerves
it
was
the
call
of
siva
replied
smith
hoarsely
what
is
it
who
uttered
it
what
does
it
mean
i
do
know
what
it
is
petrie
nor
who
utters
it
but
it
means
death
chapter
xiv
there
may
be
some
who
could
have
lain
chained
to
that
noisome
cell
and
felt
no
fear
no
dread
of
what
the
blackness
might
hold
i
confess
that
i
am
not
one
of
these
i
knew
that
nayland
smith
and
i
stood
in
the
path
of
the
most
stupendous
genius
who
in
the
world
history
had
devoted
his
intellect
to
crime
i
knew
that
the
enormous
wealth
of
the
political
group
backing
rendered
him
a
menace
to
europe
and
to
america
greater
than
that
of
the
plague
he
was
a
scientist
trained
at
a
great
university
an
explorer
of
nature
secrets
who
had
gone
farther
into
the
unknown
i
suppose
than
any
living
man
his
mission
was
to
remove
all
obstacles
human
obstacles
from
the
path
of
that
secret
movement
which
was
progressing
in
the
far
east
smith
and
i
were
two
such
obstacles
and
of
all
the
horrible
devices
at
his
command
i
wondered
and
my
tortured
brain
refused
to
leave
the
subject
by
which
of
them
were
we
doomed
to
be
dispatched
even
at
that
very
moment
some
venomous
centipede
might
be
wriggling
towards
me
over
the
slime
of
the
stones
some
poisonous
spider
be
preparing
to
drop
from
the
roof
might
have
released
a
serpent
in
the
cellar
or
the
air
be
alive
with
microbes
of
a
loathsome
disease
smith
i
said
scarcely
recognizing
my
own
voice
i
ca
bear
this
suspense
he
intends
to
kill
us
that
is
certain
but
do
worry
came
the
reply
he
intends
to
learn
our
plans
first
you
mean
you
heard
him
speak
of
his
files
and
of
his
wire
jacket
oh
my
god
i
groaned
can
this
be
england
smith
laughed
dryly
and
i
heard
him
fumbling
with
the
steel
collar
about
his
neck
i
have
one
great
hope
he
said
since
you
share
my
captivity
but
we
must
neglect
no
minor
chance
try
with
your
if
you
can
force
the
lock
i
am
trying
to
break
this
one
truth
to
tell
the
idea
had
not
entered
my
mind
but
i
immediately
acted
upon
my
friend
suggestion
setting
to
work
with
the
small
blade
of
my
knife
i
was
so
engaged
and
having
snapped
one
blade
was
about
to
open
another
when
a
sound
arrested
me
it
came
from
beneath
my
feet
smith
i
whispered
listen
the
scraping
and
clicking
which
told
of
smith
efforts
ceased
motionless
we
sat
in
that
humid
darkness
and
listened
something
was
moving
beneath
the
stones
of
the
cellar
i
held
my
breath
every
nerve
in
my
body
was
strung
up
a
line
of
light
showed
a
few
feet
from
where
we
lay
it
widened
became
an
oblong
a
trap
was
lifted
and
within
a
yard
of
me
there
rose
a
dimly
seen
head
horror
i
had
expected
and
death
or
worse
instead
i
saw
a
lovely
face
crowned
with
a
disordered
mass
of
curling
hair
i
saw
a
white
arm
upholding
the
stone
slab
a
shapely
arm
clasped
about
the
elbow
by
a
broad
gold
bangle
the
girl
climbed
into
the
cellar
and
placed
the
lantern
on
the
stone
floor
in
the
dim
light
she
was
unreal
a
figure
from
an
opium
vision
with
her
clinging
silk
draperies
and
garish
jewelry
with
her
feet
encased
in
little
red
slippers
in
short
this
was
the
houri
of
my
vision
materialized
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
we
were
in
modern
england
easy
to
dream
that
we
were
the
captives
of
a
caliph
in
a
dungeon
in
old
bagdad
my
prayers
are
answered
said
smith
softly
she
has
come
to
save
you
warned
the
girl
and
her
wonderful
eyes
opened
widely
fearfully
a
sound
and
he
will
kill
us
all
she
bent
over
me
a
key
jarred
in
the
lock
which
had
broken
my
penknife
and
the
collar
was
off
as
i
rose
to
my
feet
the
girl
turned
and
released
smith
she
raised
the
lantern
above
the
trap
and
signed
to
us
to
descend
the
wooden
steps
which
its
light
revealed
your
knife
she
whispered
to
me
leave
it
on
the
floor
he
will
think
you
forced
the
locks
down
quickly
nayland
smith
stepping
gingerly
disappeared
into
the
darkness
i
rapidly
followed
last
of
all
came
our
mysterious
friend
a
gold
band
about
one
of
her
ankles
gleaming
in
the
rays
of
the
lantern
which
she
carried
we
stood
in
a
passage
tie
your
handkerchiefs
over
your
eyes
and
do
exactly
as
i
tell
you
she
ordered
neither
of
us
hesitated
to
obey
her
i
allowed
her
to
lead
me
and
smith
rested
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
in
that
order
we
proceeded
and
came
to
stone
steps
which
we
ascended
keep
to
the
wall
on
the
left
came
a
whisper
there
is
danger
on
the
right
with
my
free
hand
i
felt
for
and
found
the
wall
and
we
pressed
forward
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
through
which
we
were
passing
was
steamy
and
loaded
with
an
odor
like
that
of
exotic
plant
life
but
a
faint
animal
scent
crept
to
my
nostrils
too
and
there
was
a
subdued
stir
about
me
infinitely
suggestive
mysterious
now
my
feet
sank
in
a
soft
carpet
and
a
curtain
brushed
my
shoulder
a
gong
sounded
we
stopped
the
din
of
distant
drumming
came
to
my
ears
where
in
heaven
name
are
we
hissed
smith
in
my
ear
that
is
a
the
little
hand
grasping
mine
quivered
nervously
we
were
near
a
door
or
a
window
for
a
breath
of
perfume
was
wafted
through
the
air
and
it
reminded
me
of
my
other
meetings
with
the
beautiful
woman
who
was
now
leading
us
from
the
house
of
who
with
her
own
lips
had
told
me
that
she
was
his
slave
through
the
horrible
phantasmagoria
she
flitted
a
seductive
vision
her
piquant
loveliness
standing
out
richly
in
its
black
setting
of
murder
and
devilry
not
once
but
a
thousand
times
i
had
tried
to
reason
out
the
nature
of
the
tie
which
bound
her
to
the
sinister
doctor
silence
fell
quick
this
way
down
a
thickly
carpeted
stair
we
went
our
guide
opened
a
door
and
led
us
along
a
passage
another
door
was
opened
and
we
were
in
the
open
air
but
the
girl
never
tarried
pulling
me
along
a
graveled
path
with
a
fresh
breeze
blowing
in
my
face
and
along
until
unmistakably
i
stood
upon
the
river
bank
now
planking
creaked
to
our
tread
and
looking
downward
beneath
the
handkerchief
i
saw
the
gleam
of
water
beneath
my
feet
be
careful
i
was
warned
and
found
myself
stepping
into
a
narrow
boat
a
punt
nayland
smith
followed
and
the
girl
pushed
the
punt
off
and
poled
out
into
the
stream
do
speak
she
directed
my
brain
was
fevered
i
scarce
knew
if
i
dreamed
and
was
waking
or
if
the
reality
ended
with
my
imprisonment
in
the
clammy
cellar
and
this
silent
escape
blindfolded
upon
the
river
with
a
girl
for
our
guide
who
might
have
stepped
out
of
the
pages
of
the
arabian
nights
were
fantasy
the
mockery
of
sleep
indeed
i
began
seriously
to
doubt
if
this
stream
whereon
we
floated
whose
waters
plashed
and
tinkled
about
us
were
the
thames
the
tigris
or
the
styx
the
punt
touched
a
bank
you
will
hear
a
clock
strike
in
a
few
minutes
said
the
girl
with
her
soft
charming
accent
but
i
rely
upon
your
honor
not
to
remove
the
handkerchiefs
until
then
you
owe
me
this
we
do
said
smith
fervently
i
heard
him
scrambling
to
the
bank
and
a
moment
later
a
soft
hand
was
placed
in
mine
and
i
too
was
guided
on
to
terra
firma
arrived
on
the
bank
i
still
held
the
girl
hand
drawing
her
towards
me
you
must
not
go
back
i
whispered
we
will
take
care
of
you
you
must
not
return
to
that
place
let
me
go
she
said
when
once
i
asked
you
to
take
me
from
him
you
spoke
of
police
protection
that
was
your
answer
police
protection
you
would
let
them
lock
me
up
imprison
me
and
make
me
betray
him
for
what
for
what
she
wrenched
herself
free
how
little
you
understand
me
never
mind
perhaps
one
day
you
will
know
until
the
clock
strikes
she
was
gone
i
heard
the
creak
of
the
punt
the
drip
of
the
water
from
the
pole
fainter
it
grew
and
fainter
what
is
her
secret
muttered
smith
beside
me
why
does
she
cling
to
that
monster
the
distant
sound
died
away
entirely
a
clock
began
to
strike
it
struck
the
in
an
instant
my
handkerchief
was
off
and
so
was
smith
we
stood
upon
a
away
to
the
left
the
moon
shone
upon
the
towers
and
battlements
of
an
ancient
fortress
it
was
windsor
castle
ten
cried
smith
two
hours
to
save
graham
guthrie
we
had
exactly
fourteen
minutes
in
which
to
catch
the
last
train
to
waterloo
and
we
caught
it
but
i
sank
into
a
corner
of
the
compartment
in
a
state
bordering
upon
collapse
neither
of
us
i
think
could
have
managed
another
twenty
yards
with
a
lesser
stake
than
a
human
life
at
issue
i
doubt
if
we
should
have
attempted
that
dash
to
windsor
station
due
at
waterloo
at
panted
smith
that
gives
us
minutes
to
get
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
reach
his
hotel
where
in
heaven
name
is
that
house
situated
did
we
come
up
or
down
stream
i
could
determine
but
at
any
rate
it
stands
close
to
the
riverside
it
should
be
merely
a
question
of
time
to
identify
it
i
shall
set
scotland
yard
to
work
immediately
but
i
am
hoping
for
nothing
our
escape
will
warn
him
i
said
no
more
for
a
time
sitting
wiping
the
perspiration
from
my
forehead
and
watching
my
friend
load
his
cracked
briar
with
the
broadcut
latakia
mixture
smith
i
said
at
last
what
was
that
horrible
wailing
we
heard
and
what
did
mean
when
he
referred
to
rangoon
i
noticed
how
it
affected
you
my
friend
nodded
and
lighted
his
pipe
there
was
a
ghastly
business
there
in
or
early
in
he
replied
an
utterly
mysterious
epidemic
and
this
beastly
wailing
was
associated
with
it
in
what
way
and
what
do
you
mean
by
an
epidemic
it
began
i
believe
at
the
palace
mansions
hotel
in
the
cantonments
a
young
american
whose
name
i
can
not
recall
was
staying
there
on
business
connected
with
some
new
iron
buildings
one
night
he
went
to
his
room
locked
the
door
and
jumped
out
of
the
window
into
the
courtyard
broke
his
neck
of
course
suicide
apparently
but
there
were
singular
features
in
the
case
for
instance
his
revolver
lay
beside
him
fully
loaded
in
the
courtyard
in
the
courtyard
was
it
murder
by
any
chance
smith
shrugged
his
shoulders
his
door
was
found
locked
from
the
inside
had
to
be
broken
in
but
the
wailing
business
that
began
later
or
was
only
noticed
later
a
french
doctor
named
lafitte
died
in
exactly
the
same
way
at
the
same
place
at
the
same
hotel
but
he
occupied
a
different
room
here
is
the
extraordinary
part
of
the
affair
a
friend
shared
the
room
with
him
and
actually
saw
him
go
saw
him
leap
from
the
window
yes
the
friend
an
englishman
was
aroused
by
the
uncanny
wailing
i
was
in
rangoon
at
the
time
so
that
i
know
more
of
the
case
of
lafitte
than
of
that
of
the
american
i
spoke
to
the
man
about
it
personally
he
was
an
electrical
engineer
edward
martin
and
he
told
me
that
the
cry
seemed
to
come
from
above
him
it
seemed
to
come
from
above
when
we
heard
it
at
house
martin
sat
up
in
bed
it
was
a
clear
moonlight
night
the
sort
of
moonlight
you
get
in
burma
lafitte
for
some
reason
had
just
gone
to
the
window
his
friend
saw
him
look
out
the
next
moment
with
a
dreadful
scream
he
threw
himself
forward
and
crashed
down
into
the
courtyard
what
then
martin
ran
to
the
window
and
looked
down
lafitte
scream
had
aroused
the
place
of
course
but
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
account
for
the
occurrence
there
was
no
balcony
no
ledge
by
means
of
which
anyone
could
reach
the
window
but
how
did
you
come
to
recognize
the
cry
i
stopped
at
the
palace
mansions
for
some
time
and
one
night
this
uncanny
howling
aroused
me
i
heard
it
quite
distinctly
and
am
never
likely
to
forget
it
it
was
followed
by
a
hoarse
yell
the
man
in
the
next
room
an
orchid
hunter
had
gone
the
same
way
as
the
others
did
you
change
your
quarters
no
fortunately
for
the
reputation
of
the
hotel
a
establishment
several
similar
cases
occurred
elsewhere
both
in
rangoon
in
prome
and
in
moulmein
a
story
got
about
the
native
quarter
and
was
fostered
by
some
mad
fakir
that
the
god
siva
was
reborn
and
that
the
cry
was
his
call
for
victims
a
ghastly
story
which
led
to
an
outbreak
of
dacoity
and
gave
the
district
superintendent
no
end
of
trouble
was
there
anything
unusual
about
the
bodies
they
all
developed
marks
after
death
as
though
they
had
been
strangled
the
marks
were
said
all
to
possess
a
peculiar
form
though
it
was
not
appreciable
to
my
eye
and
this
again
was
declared
to
be
the
five
heads
of
siva
were
the
deaths
confined
to
europeans
oh
no
several
burmans
and
others
died
in
the
same
way
at
first
there
was
a
theory
that
the
victims
had
contracted
leprosy
and
committed
suicide
as
a
result
but
the
medical
evidence
disproved
that
the
call
of
siva
became
a
perfect
nightmare
throughout
burma
did
you
ever
hear
it
again
before
this
evening
yes
i
heard
it
on
the
upper
irrawaddy
one
clear
moonlight
night
and
a
colassie
a
leaped
from
the
top
deck
of
the
steamer
aboard
which
i
was
traveling
my
god
to
think
that
the
fiend
has
brought
that
to
england
but
brought
what
smith
i
cried
in
perplexity
what
has
he
brought
an
evil
spirit
a
mental
disease
what
is
it
what
can
it
be
a
new
agent
of
death
petrie
something
born
in
a
of
burma
the
home
of
much
that
is
unclean
and
much
that
is
inexplicable
heaven
grant
that
we
be
in
time
and
are
able
to

chapter

the
train
was
late
and
as
our
cab
turned
out
of
waterloo
station
and
began
to
ascend
to
the
bridge
from
a
hundred
steeples
rang
out
the
gongs
of
midnight
the
bell
of
paul
raised
above
them
all
to
vie
with
the
deep
voice
of
big
ben
i
looked
out
from
the
cab
window
across
the
river
to
where
towering
above
the
embankment
that
place
of
a
thousand
tragedies
the
light
of
some
of
london
greatest
caravanserais
formed
a
sort
of
minor
constellation
from
the
subdued
blaze
that
showed
the
public
i
looked
up
to
the
hundreds
of
starry
points
marking
the
private
apartments
of
those
giant
inns
i
thought
how
each
twinkling
window
denoted
the
presence
of
some
bird
of
passage
some
wanderer
temporarily
abiding
in
our
midst
there
floor
piled
upon
floor
above
the
chattering
throngs
were
these
less
gregarious
units
each
something
of
a
mystery
to
his
each
in
his
separate
cell
and
each
as
remote
from
real
human
companionship
as
if
that
cell
were
fashioned
not
in
the
bricks
of
london
but
in
the
rocks
of
hindustan
in
one
of
those
rooms
graham
guthrie
might
at
that
moment
be
sleeping
all
unaware
that
he
would
awake
to
the
call
of
siva
to
the
summons
of
death
as
we
neared
the
strand
smith
stopped
the
cab
discharging
the
man
outside
sotheby
one
of
the
doctor
may
be
in
the
foyer
he
said
thoughtfully
and
it
might
spoil
everything
if
we
were
seen
to
go
to
guthrie
rooms
there
must
be
a
back
entrance
to
the
kitchens
and
so
on
there
is
i
replied
quickly
i
have
seen
the
vans
delivering
there
but
have
we
time
yes
lead
on
we
walked
up
the
strand
and
hurried
westward
into
that
narrow
court
with
its
iron
posts
and
descending
steps
upon
which
opens
a
we
turned
then
going
parallel
with
the
strand
but
on
the
embankment
level
we
ran
round
the
back
of
the
great
hotel
and
came
to
double
doors
which
were
open
an
arc
lamp
illuminated
the
interior
and
a
number
of
men
were
at
work
among
the
casks
crates
and
packages
stacked
about
the
place
we
entered
hallo
cried
a
man
in
a
white
overall
where
think
going
smith
grasped
him
by
the
arm
i
want
to
get
to
the
public
part
of
the
hotel
without
being
seen
from
the
entrance
hall
he
said
will
you
please
lead
the
way
here
began
the
other
staring
do
waste
time
snapped
my
friend
in
that
tone
of
authority
which
he
knew
so
well
how
to
assume
it
a
matter
of
life
and
death
lead
the
way
i
say
police
sir
asked
the
man
civilly
yes
said
smith
hurry
off
went
our
guide
without
further
demur
skirting
sculleries
kitchens
laundries
and
he
led
us
through
those
mysterious
labyrinths
which
have
no
existence
for
the
guest
above
but
which
contain
the
machinery
that
renders
these
modern
khans
the
aladdin
palaces
they
are
on
a
landing
we
met
a
man
in
a
tweed
suit
to
whom
our
cicerone
presented
us
glad
i
met
you
sir
two
gentlemen
from
the
police
the
man
regarded
us
haughtily
with
a
suspicious
smile
who
are
you
he
asked
you
not
from
scotland
yard
at
any
rate
smith
pulled
out
a
card
and
thrust
it
into
the
speaker
hand
if
you
are
the
hotel
detective
he
said
take
us
without
delay
to
graham
guthrie
a
marked
change
took
place
in
the
other
demeanor
on
glancing
at
the
card
in
his
hand
excuse
me
sir
he
said
deferentially
but
of
course
i
did
know
who
i
was
speaking
to
we
all
have
instructions
to
give
you
every
assistance
is
guthrie
in
his
room
he
been
in
his
room
for
some
time
sir
you
will
want
to
get
there
without
being
seen
this
way
we
can
join
the
lift
on
the
third
floor
off
we
went
again
with
our
new
guide
in
the
lift
have
you
noticed
anything
suspicious
about
the
place
asked
smith
i
have
was
the
startling
reply
that
accounts
for
your
finding
me
where
you
did
my
usual
post
is
in
the
lobby
but
about
eleven
when
the
theater
people
began
to
come
in
i
had
a
hazy
sort
of
impression
that
someone
or
something
slipped
past
in
the
crowd
something
that
had
no
business
in
the
hotel
we
got
out
of
the
lift
i
do
quite
follow
you
said
smith
if
you
thought
you
saw
something
entering
you
must
have
formed
a
more
or
less
definite
impression
regarding
it
that
the
funny
part
of
the
business
answered
the
man
doggedly
i
did
but
as
i
stood
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
i
could
have
sworn
that
there
was
something
crawling
up
behind
a
party
two
ladies
and
two
gentlemen
a
dog
for
instance
it
did
strike
me
as
being
a
dog
sir
anyway
when
the
party
passed
me
there
was
nothing
there
mind
you
whatever
it
was
it
had
come
in
by
the
front
i
have
made
inquiries
everywhere
but
without
result
he
stopped
abruptly
no
guthrie
door
sir
smith
knocked
hallo
came
a
muffled
voice
what
do
you
want
open
the
door
do
delay
it
is
important
he
turned
to
the
hotel
detective
stay
right
there
where
you
can
watch
the
stairs
and
the
lift
he
instructed
and
note
everyone
and
everything
that
passes
this
door
but
whatever
you
see
or
hear
do
nothing
without
my
orders
the
man
moved
off
and
the
door
was
opened
smith
whispered
in
my
ear
some
creature
of
is
in
the
hotel
graham
guthrie
british
resident
in
north
bhutan
was
a
big
man
and
florid
with
widely
opened
eyes
of
the
true
fighting
blue
a
bristling
mustache
and
prominent
shaggy
brows
nayland
smith
introduced
himself
tersely
proffering
his
card
and
an
open
letter
those
are
my
credentials
guthrie
he
said
so
no
doubt
you
will
realize
that
the
business
which
brings
me
and
my
friend
petrie
here
at
such
an
hour
is
of
the
first
importance
he
switched
off
the
light
there
is
no
time
for
ceremony
he
explained
it
is
now
minutes
past
twelve
at
an
attempt
will
be
made
upon
your
life
smith
said
the
other
who
arrayed
in
his
pajamas
was
seated
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
you
alarm
me
very
greatly
i
may
mention
that
i
was
advised
of
your
presence
in
england
this
morning
do
you
know
anything
respecting
the
person
called
dr
only
what
i
was
told
that
he
is
the
agent
of
an
advanced
political
group
it
is
opposed
to
his
interests
that
you
should
return
to
bhutan
a
more
gullible
agent
would
be
preferable
therefore
unless
you
implicitly
obey
my
instructions
you
will
never
leave
england
graham
guthrie
breathed
quickly
i
was
growing
more
used
to
the
gloom
and
i
could
dimly
discern
him
his
face
turned
towards
nayland
smith
whilst
with
his
hand
he
clutched
the
such
a
visit
as
ours
i
think
must
have
shaken
the
nerve
of
any
man
but
smith
he
said
surely
i
am
safe
enough
here
the
place
is
full
of
american
visitors
at
present
and
i
have
had
to
be
content
with
a
room
right
at
the
top
so
that
the
only
danger
i
apprehend
is
that
of
fire
there
is
another
danger
replied
smith
the
fact
that
you
are
at
the
top
of
the
building
enhances
that
danger
do
you
recall
anything
of
the
mysterious
epidemic
which
broke
out
in
rangoon
in
the
deaths
due
to
the
call
of
siva
i
read
of
it
in
the
indian
papers
said
guthrie
uneasily
suicides
were
they
not
no
snapped
smith
murders
there
was
a
brief
silence
from
what
i
recall
of
the
cases
said
guthrie
that
seems
impossible
in
several
instances
the
victims
threw
themselves
from
the
windows
of
locked
rooms
and
the
windows
were
quite
inaccessible
exactly
replied
smith
and
in
the
dim
light
his
revolver
gleamed
dully
as
he
placed
it
on
the
small
table
beside
the
bed
except
that
your
door
is
unlocked
the
conditions
are
identical
silence
please
i
hear
a
clock
striking
it
was
big
ben
it
struck
the
leaving
the
stillness
complete
in
that
room
high
above
the
activity
which
yet
prevailed
below
high
above
the
supping
crowds
in
the
hotel
high
above
the
starving
crowds
on
the
embankment
a
curious
chill
of
isolation
swept
about
me
again
i
realized
how
in
the
very
heart
of
the
great
metropolis
a
man
may
be
as
far
from
aid
as
in
the
heart
of
a
desert
i
was
glad
that
i
was
not
alone
in
that
room
marked
with
the
of
and
i
am
certain
that
graham
guthrie
welcomed
his
unexpected
company
i
may
have
mentioned
the
fact
before
but
on
this
occasion
it
became
so
peculiarly
evident
to
me
that
i
am
constrained
to
record
it
here
i
refer
to
the
sense
of
impending
danger
which
invariably
preceded
a
visit
from
even
had
i
not
known
that
an
attempt
was
to
be
made
that
night
i
should
have
realized
it
as
strung
to
high
tension
i
waited
in
the
darkness
some
invisible
herald
went
ahead
of
the
dreadful
chinaman
proclaiming
his
coming
to
every
nerve
in
one
body
it
was
like
a
breath
of
astral
incense
announcing
the
presence
of
the
priests
of
death
a
wail
low
but
singularly
penetrating
falling
in
minor
cadences
to
a
new
silence
came
from
somewhere
close
at
hand
my
god
hissed
guthrie
what
was
that
the
call
of
siva
whispered
smith
do
stir
for
your
life
guthrie
was
breathing
hard
i
knew
that
we
were
three
that
the
hotel
detective
was
within
hail
that
there
was
a
telephone
in
the
room
that
the
traffic
of
the
embankment
moved
almost
beneath
us
but
i
knew
and
am
not
ashamed
to
confess
that
king
fear
had
icy
fingers
about
my
heart
it
was
awful
that
tense
waiting
for
what
three
taps
sounded
very
distinctly
upon
the
window
graham
guthrie
started
so
as
to
shake
the
bed
it
supernatural
he
muttered
all
that
was
celtic
in
his
blood
recoiling
from
the
omen
nothing
human
can
reach
that
window
from
smith
do
stir
the
tapping
was
repeated
smith
softly
crossed
the
room
my
heart
was
beating
painfully
he
threw
open
the
window
further
inaction
was
impossible
i
joined
him
and
we
looked
out
into
the
empty
air
do
come
too
near
petrie
he
warned
over
his
shoulder
one
on
either
side
of
the
open
window
we
stood
and
looked
down
at
the
moving
embankment
lights
at
the
glitter
of
the
thames
at
the
silhouetted
buildings
on
the
farther
bank
with
the
shot
tower
starting
above
them
all
three
taps
sounded
on
the
panes
above
us
in
all
my
dealings
with
i
had
had
to
face
nothing
so
uncanny
as
this
what
burmese
ghoul
had
he
loosed
was
it
outside
in
the
air
was
it
actually
in
the
room
do
let
me
go
petrie
whispered
smith
suddenly
get
a
tight
hold
on
me
that
was
the
last
straw
for
i
thought
that
some
dreadful
fascination
was
impelling
my
friend
to
hurl
himself
out
wildly
i
threw
my
arms
about
him
and
guthrie
leaped
forward
to
help
smith
leaned
from
the
window
and
looked
up
one
choking
cry
he
gave
smothered
inarticulate
and
i
found
him
slipping
from
my
grip
being
drawn
out
of
the
window
drawn
to
his
death
hold
him
guthrie
i
gasped
hoarsely
my
god
he
going
hold
him
my
friend
writhed
in
our
grasp
and
i
saw
him
stretch
his
arm
upward
the
crack
of
his
revolver
came
and
he
collapsed
on
to
the
floor
carrying
me
with
him
but
as
i
fell
i
heard
a
scream
above
smith
revolver
went
hurtling
through
the
air
and
hard
upon
it
went
a
black
shape
flashing
past
the
open
window
into
the
gulf
of
the
night
the
light
the
light
i
cried
guthrie
ran
and
turned
on
the
light
nayland
smith
his
eyes
starting
from
his
head
his
face
swollen
lay
plucking
at
a
silken
cord
which
showed
tight
about
his
throat
it
was
a
thug
screamed
guthrie
get
the
rope
off
he
choking
my
hands
i
seized
the
a
knife
quick
i
cried
i
have
lost
mine
guthrie
ran
to
the
and
passed
me
an
open
penknife
i
somehow
forced
the
blade
between
the
rope
and
smith
swollen
neck
and
severed
the
deadly
silken
thing
smith
made
a
choking
noise
and
fell
back
swooning
in
my
arms
when
later
we
stood
looking
down
upon
the
mutilated
thing
which
had
been
brought
in
from
where
it
fell
smith
showed
me
a
mark
on
the
brow
close
beside
the
wound
where
his
bullet
had
entered
the
mark
of
kali
he
said
the
man
was
a
phansigar
a
religious
strangler
since
has
dacoits
in
his
service
i
might
have
expected
that
he
would
have
thugs
a
group
of
these
fiends
would
seem
to
have
fled
into
burma
so
that
the
mysterious
epidemic
in
rangoon
was
really
an
outbreak
of
thuggee
on
slightly
improved
lines
i
had
suspected
something
of
the
kind
but
naturally
i
had
not
looked
for
thugs
near
rangoon
my
unexpected
resistance
led
the
strangler
to
bungle
the
rope
you
have
seen
how
it
was
fastened
about
my
throat
that
was
unscientific
the
true
method
as
practiced
by
the
group
operating
in
burma
was
to
throw
the
line
about
the
victim
neck
and
jerk
him
from
the
window
a
man
leaning
from
an
open
window
is
very
nicely
poised
it
requires
only
a
slight
jerk
to
pitch
him
forward
no
loop
was
used
but
a
running
line
which
as
the
victim
fell
remained
in
the
hand
of
the
murderer
no
clew
therefore
we
see
at
once
what
commended
the
system
to
graham
guthrie
very
pale
stood
looking
down
at
the
dead
strangler
i
owe
you
my
life
smith
he
said
if
you
had
come
five
minutes
later
he
grasped
smith
hand
you
see
guthrie
continued
no
one
thought
of
looking
for
a
thug
in
burma
and
no
one
thought
of
the
roof
these
fellows
are
as
active
as
monkeys
and
where
an
ordinary
man
would
infallibly
break
his
neck
they
are
entirely
at
home
i
might
have
chosen
my
room
especially
for
the
business
he
slipped
in
late
this
evening
said
smith
the
hotel
detective
saw
him
but
these
stranglers
are
as
elusive
as
shadows
otherwise
despite
their
having
changed
the
scene
of
their
operations
not
one
could
have
survived
did
you
mention
a
case
of
this
kind
on
the
irrawaddy
i
asked
yes
was
the
reply
and
i
know
of
what
you
are
thinking
the
steamers
of
the
irrawaddy
flotilla
have
a
roof
over
the
top
deck
the
thug
must
have
been
lying
up
there
as
the
colassie
passed
on
the
deck
below
but
smith
what
is
the
motive
of
the
call
i
continued
partly
religious
he
explained
and
partly
to
wake
the
victims
you
are
perhaps
going
to
ask
me
how
has
obtained
power
over
such
people
as
phansigars
i
can
only
reply
that
has
secret
knowledge
of
which
so
far
we
know
absolutely
nothing
but
despite
all
at
last
i
begin
to
score
you
do
i
agreed
but
your
victory
took
you
near
to
death
i
owe
my
life
to
you
petrie
he
said
once
to
your
strength
of
arm
and
once
to
do
speak
of
her
smith
i
interrupted
may
have
discovered
the
part
she
played
in
which
event
god
help
her
chapter
xvi
upon
the
following
day
we
were
afoot
again
and
shortly
at
handgrips
with
the
enemy
in
retrospect
that
restless
time
offers
a
chaotic
prospect
with
no
peaceful
spot
amid
its
turmoils
all
that
was
reposeful
in
nature
seemed
to
have
become
an
irony
and
a
mockery
to
us
who
knew
how
an
evil
demigod
had
his
sacrificial
altars
amid
our
sweetest
groves
this
idea
ruled
strongly
in
my
mind
upon
that
soft
autumnal
day
the
net
is
closing
in
said
nayland
smith
let
us
hope
upon
a
big
catch
i
replied
with
a
laugh
beyond
where
the
thames
tided
slumberously
seaward
showed
the
roofs
of
royal
windsor
the
castle
towers
showing
through
the
autumn
haze
the
peace
of
beautiful
was
about
us
this
was
one
of
the
few
tangible
clews
upon
which
thus
far
we
had
chanced
but
at
last
it
seemed
indeed
that
we
were
narrowing
the
resources
of
that
enemy
of
the
white
race
who
was
writing
his
name
over
england
in
characters
of
blood
to
capture
we
did
not
hope
but
at
least
there
was
every
promise
of
destroying
one
of
the
enemy
strongholds
we
had
circled
upon
the
map
a
tract
of
country
cut
by
the
thames
with
windsor
for
its
center
within
that
circle
was
the
house
from
which
miraculously
we
had
escaped
a
house
used
by
the
most
highly
organized
group
in
the
history
of
criminology
so
much
we
knew
even
if
we
found
the
house
and
this
was
likely
enough
to
find
it
vacated
by
and
his
mysterious
servants
we
were
prepared
but
it
would
be
a
base
destroyed
we
were
working
upon
a
methodical
plan
and
although
our
cooperators
were
invisible
these
numbered
no
fewer
than
twelve
all
of
them
experienced
men
thus
far
we
had
drawn
blank
but
the
place
for
which
smith
and
i
were
making
now
came
clearly
into
view
an
old
mansion
situated
in
extensive
walled
grounds
leaving
the
river
behind
us
we
turned
sharply
to
the
right
along
a
lane
flanked
by
a
high
wall
on
an
open
patch
of
ground
as
we
passed
i
noted
a
gypsy
caravan
an
old
woman
was
seated
on
the
steps
her
wrinkled
face
bent
her
chin
resting
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
i
scarcely
glanced
at
her
but
pressed
on
nor
did
i
notice
that
my
friend
no
longer
was
beside
me
i
was
all
anxiety
to
come
to
some
point
from
whence
i
might
obtain
a
view
of
the
house
all
anxiety
to
know
if
this
was
the
abode
of
our
mysterious
enemy
the
place
where
he
worked
amid
his
weird
company
where
he
bred
his
deadly
scorpions
and
his
bacilli
reared
his
poisonous
fungi
from
whence
he
dispatched
his
murder
ministers
above
all
perhaps
i
wondered
if
this
would
prove
to
be
the
of
the
beautiful
slave
girl
who
was
such
a
potent
factor
in
the
doctor
plans
but
a
sword
which
yet
we
hoped
to
turn
upon
even
in
the
hands
of
a
master
a
beauty
is
a
dangerous
weapon
a
cry
rang
out
behind
me
i
turned
quickly
and
a
singular
sight
met
my
gaze
nayland
smith
was
engaged
in
a
furious
struggle
with
the
old
gypsy
woman
his
long
arms
clasped
about
her
he
was
roughly
dragging
her
out
into
the
roadway
she
fighting
like
a
wild
thing
silently
fiercely
smith
often
surprised
me
but
at
that
sight
frankly
i
thought
that
he
was
become
bereft
of
reason
i
ran
back
and
i
had
almost
reached
the
scene
of
this
incredible
contest
and
smith
now
was
evidently
hard
put
to
it
to
hold
his
own
when
a
man
swarthy
with
big
rings
in
his
ears
leaped
from
the
caravan
one
quick
glance
he
threw
in
our
direction
and
made
off
towards
the
river
smith
twisted
round
upon
me
never
releasing
his
hold
of
the
woman
after
him
petrie
he
cried
after
him
do
let
him
escape
it
a
dacoit
my
brain
in
a
confused
whirl
my
mind
yet
disposed
to
a
belief
that
my
friend
had
lost
his
senses
the
word
dacoit
was
sufficient
i
started
down
the
road
after
the
fleetly
running
man
never
once
did
he
glance
behind
him
so
that
he
evidently
had
occasion
to
fear
pursuit
the
dusty
road
rang
beneath
my
flying
footsteps
that
sense
of
fantasy
which
claimed
me
often
enough
in
those
days
of
our
struggle
with
the
titanic
genius
whose
victory
meant
the
victory
of
the
yellow
races
over
the
white
now
had
me
fast
in
its
grip
again
i
was
an
actor
in
one
of
those
of
the
grim
drama
out
over
the
grass
and
down
to
the
river
brink
ran
the
gypsy
who
was
no
gypsy
but
one
of
that
far
more
sinister
brotherhood
the
dacoits
i
was
close
upon
his
heels
but
i
was
not
prepared
for
him
to
leap
in
among
the
rushes
at
the
margin
of
the
stream
and
seeing
him
do
this
i
pulled
up
quickly
straight
into
the
water
he
plunged
and
i
saw
that
he
held
some
object
in
his
hand
he
waded
out
he
dived
and
as
i
gained
the
bank
and
looked
to
right
and
left
he
had
vanished
completely
only
rings
showed
where
he
had
been
i
had
him
for
directly
he
rose
to
the
surface
he
would
be
visible
from
either
bank
and
with
the
police
whistle
which
i
carried
i
could
if
necessary
summon
one
of
the
men
in
hiding
across
the
stream
i
waited
a
floated
serenely
past
untroubled
by
this
strange
invasion
of
his
precincts
a
full
minute
i
waited
from
the
lane
behind
me
came
smith
voice
do
let
him
escape
petrie
never
lifting
my
eyes
from
the
water
i
waved
my
hand
reassuringly
but
still
the
dacoit
did
not
rise
i
searched
the
surface
in
all
directions
as
far
as
my
eyes
could
reach
but
no
swimmer
showed
above
it
then
it
was
that
i
concluded
he
had
dived
too
deeply
become
entangled
in
the
weeds
and
was
drowned
with
a
final
glance
to
right
and
left
and
some
feeling
of
awe
at
this
sudden
tragedy
this
grim
going
out
of
a
life
at
glorious
noonday
i
turned
away
smith
had
the
woman
securely
but
i
had
not
taken
five
steps
towards
him
when
a
faint
splash
behind
warned
me
instinctively
i
ducked
from
whence
that
saving
instinct
arose
i
can
not
surmise
but
to
it
i
owed
my
life
for
as
i
rapidly
lowered
my
head
something
hummed
past
me
something
that
flew
out
over
the
grass
bank
and
fell
with
a
jangle
upon
the
dusty
roadside
a
knife
i
turned
and
bounded
back
to
the
river
brink
i
heard
a
faint
cry
behind
me
which
could
only
have
come
from
the
gypsy
woman
nothing
disturbed
the
calm
surface
of
the
water
the
reach
was
lonely
of
rowers
out
by
the
farther
bank
a
girl
was
poling
a
punt
along
and
her
figure
was
the
only
living
thing
that
moved
upon
the
river
within
the
range
of
the
most
expert
to
say
that
i
was
nonplused
is
to
say
less
than
the
truth
i
was
amazed
that
it
was
the
dacoit
who
had
shown
me
this
murderous
attention
i
could
not
doubt
but
where
in
heaven
name
was
he
he
could
not
humanly
have
remained
below
water
for
so
long
yet
he
certainly
was
not
above
was
not
upon
the
surface
concealed
amongst
the
reeds
nor
hidden
upon
the
bank
there
in
the
bright
sunshine
a
consciousness
of
the
eerie
possessed
me
it
was
with
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
my
phantom
foe
might
be
aiming
a
second
knife
at
my
back
that
i
turned
away
and
hastened
towards
smith
my
fearful
expectations
were
not
realized
and
i
picked
up
the
little
weapon
which
had
so
narrowly
missed
me
and
with
it
in
my
hand
rejoined
my
friend
he
was
standing
with
one
arm
closely
clasped
about
the
apparently
exhausted
woman
and
her
dark
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
with
an
extraordinary
expression
what
does
it
mean
smith
i
began
but
he
interrupted
me
where
is
the
dacoit
he
demanded
rapidly
since
he
seemingly
possesses
the
attributes
of
a
fish
i
replied
i
can
not
pretend
to
say
the
gypsy
woman
lifted
her
eyes
to
mine
and
laughed
her
laughter
was
musical
not
that
of
such
an
old
hag
as
smith
held
captive
it
was
familiar
too
i
started
and
looked
closely
into
the
wizened
face
he
tricked
you
said
smith
an
angry
note
in
his
voice
what
is
that
you
have
in
your
hand
i
showed
him
the
knife
and
told
him
how
it
had
come
into
my
possession
i
know
he
rapped
i
saw
it
he
was
in
the
water
not
three
yards
from
where
you
stood
you
must
have
seen
him
was
there
nothing
visible
nothing
the
woman
laughed
again
and
again
i
wondered
a
i
added
nothing
else
a
snapped
smith
if
you
will
consult
your
recollections
of
the
habits
of
you
will
see
that
this
particular
specimen
was
a
rara
avis
it
an
old
trick
petrie
but
a
good
one
for
it
is
used
in
decoying
a
dacoit
head
was
concealed
in
that
it
useless
he
has
certainly
made
good
his
escape
by
now
smith
i
said
somewhat
crestfallen
why
are
you
detaining
this
gypsy
woman
gypsy
woman
he
laughed
hugging
her
tightly
as
she
made
an
impatient
movement
use
your
eyes
old
man
he
jerked
the
frowsy
wig
from
her
head
and
beneath
was
a
cloud
of
disordered
hair
that
shimmered
in
the
sunlight
a
wet
sponge
will
do
the
rest
he
said
into
my
eyes
widely
opened
in
wonder
looked
the
dark
eyes
of
the
captive
and
beneath
the
disguise
i
picked
out
the
charming
features
of
the
slave
girl
there
were
tears
on
the
whitened
lashes
and
she
was
submissive
now
this
time
said
my
friend
hardly
we
have
fairly
captured
her
and
we
will
hold
her
from
somewhere
came
a
faint
call
the
dacoit
nayland
smith
lean
body
straightened
he
stood
alert
strung
up
another
call
answered
and
a
third
responded
then
followed
the
flatly
shrill
note
of
a
police
whistle
and
i
noted
a
column
of
black
vapor
rising
beyond
the
wall
mounting
straight
to
heaven
as
the
smoke
of
a
welcome
offering
the
surrounded
mansion
was
in
flames
curse
it
rapped
smith
so
this
time
we
were
right
but
of
course
he
has
had
ample
opportunity
to
remove
his
effects
i
knew
that
the
man
daring
is
incredible
he
has
given
himself
till
the
very
last
moment
and
we
blundered
upon
two
of
the
outposts
i
lost
one
no
matter
we
have
the
other
i
expect
no
further
arrests
and
the
house
will
have
been
so
well
fired
by
the
doctor
servants
that
nothing
can
save
it
i
fear
its
ashes
will
afford
us
no
clew
petrie
but
we
have
secured
a
lever
which
should
serve
to
disturb
world
he
glanced
at
the
queer
figure
which
hung
submissively
in
his
arms
she
looked
up
proudly
you
need
not
hold
me
so
tight
she
said
in
her
soft
voice
i
will
come
with
you
that
i
moved
amid
singular
happenings
you
who
have
borne
with
me
thus
far
have
learned
and
that
i
witnessed
many
curious
scenes
but
of
the
many
such
scenes
in
that
wherein
nayland
smith
and
played
the
leading
parts
i
remember
none
more
bizarre
than
the
one
at
my
rooms
that
afternoon
without
delay
and
without
taking
the
scotland
yard
men
into
our
confidence
we
had
hurried
our
prisoner
back
to
london
for
my
authority
was
supreme
a
strange
trio
we
were
and
one
which
excited
no
little
comment
but
the
journey
came
to
an
end
at
last
now
we
were
in
my
unpretentious
the
room
wherein
smith
first
had
unfolded
to
me
the
story
of
and
of
the
great
secret
society
which
sought
to
upset
the
balance
of
the
world
to
place
europe
and
america
beneath
the
scepter
of
cathay
i
sat
with
my
elbows
upon
the
my
chin
in
my
hands
smith
restlessly
paced
the
floor
relighting
his
blackened
briar
a
dozen
times
in
as
many
minutes
in
the
big
the
pseudogypsy
was
curled
up
a
brief
toilet
had
converted
the
wizened
old
woman
face
into
that
of
a
fascinatingly
pretty
girl
wildly
picturesque
she
looked
in
her
ragged
romany
garb
she
held
a
cigarette
in
her
fingers
and
watched
us
through
lowered
lashes
seemingly
with
true
oriental
fatalism
she
was
quite
reconciled
to
her
fate
and
ever
and
anon
she
would
bestow
upon
me
a
glance
from
her
beautiful
eyes
which
few
men
i
say
with
confidence
could
have
sustained
unmoved
though
i
could
not
be
blind
to
the
emotions
of
that
passionate
eastern
soul
yet
i
strove
not
to
think
of
them
accomplice
of
an
she
might
be
but
she
was
dangerously
lovely
that
man
who
was
with
you
said
smith
suddenly
turning
upon
her
was
in
burma
up
till
quite
recently
he
murdered
a
fisherman
thirty
miles
above
prome
only
a
mouth
before
i
left
the
had
placed
a
thousand
rupees
on
his
head
am
i
right
the
girl
shrugged
her
shoulders
suppose
what
then
she
asked
suppose
i
handed
you
over
to
the
police
suggested
smith
but
he
spoke
without
conviction
for
in
the
recent
past
we
both
had
owed
our
lives
to
this
girl
as
you
please
she
replied
the
police
would
learn
nothing
you
do
not
belong
to
the
far
east
my
friend
said
abruptly
you
may
have
eastern
blood
in
your
veins
but
you
are
no
kin
of
that
is
true
she
admitted
and
knocked
the
ash
from
her
cigarette
will
you
tell
me
where
to
find
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
again
glancing
eloquently
in
my
direction
smith
walked
to
the
door
i
must
make
out
my
report
petrie
he
said
look
after
the
prisoner
and
as
the
door
closed
softly
behind
him
i
knew
what
was
expected
of
me
but
honestly
i
shirked
my
responsibility
what
attitude
should
i
adopt
how
should
i
go
about
my
delicate
task
in
a
quandary
i
stood
watching
the
girl
whom
singular
circumstances
saw
captive
in
my
rooms
you
do
not
think
we
would
harm
you
i
began
awkwardly
no
harm
shall
come
to
you
why
will
you
not
trust
us
she
raised
her
brilliant
eyes
of
what
avail
has
your
protection
been
to
some
of
those
others
she
said
those
others
whom
he
has
sought
for
alas
it
had
been
of
none
and
i
knew
it
well
i
thought
i
grasped
the
drift
of
her
words
you
mean
that
if
you
speak
will
find
a
way
of
killing
you
of
killing
me
she
flashed
scornfully
do
i
seem
one
to
fear
for
myself
then
what
do
you
fear
i
asked
in
surprise
she
looked
at
me
oddly
when
i
was
seized
and
sold
for
a
slave
she
answered
slowly
my
sister
was
taken
too
and
my
brother
a
child
she
spoke
the
word
with
a
tender
intonation
and
her
slight
accent
rendered
it
the
more
soft
my
sister
died
in
the
desert
my
brother
lived
better
far
better
that
he
had
died
too
her
words
impressed
me
intensely
of
what
are
you
speaking
i
questioned
you
speak
of
of
the
desert
where
did
these
things
take
place
of
what
country
are
you
does
it
matter
she
questioned
in
turn
of
what
country
am
i
a
slave
has
no
country
no
name
no
name
i
cried
you
may
call
me
karamaneh
she
said
as
karamaneh
i
was
sold
to
and
my
brother
also
he
purchased
we
were
cheap
at
the
price
he
paid
she
laughed
shortly
wildly
but
he
has
spent
a
lot
of
money
to
educate
me
my
brother
is
all
that
is
left
to
me
in
the
world
to
love
and
he
is
in
the
power
of
you
understand
it
is
upon
him
the
blow
will
fall
you
ask
me
to
fight
against
you
talk
of
protection
did
your
protection
save
sir
crichton
davey
i
shook
my
head
sadly
you
understand
now
why
i
can
not
disobey
my
master
orders
why
if
i
would
i
dare
not
betray
him
i
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
how
could
i
answer
her
arguments
what
could
i
say
i
heard
the
rustle
of
her
ragged
skirts
and
she
who
called
herself
karamaneh
stood
beside
me
she
laid
her
hand
upon
my
arm
let
me
go
she
pleaded
he
will
kill
him
he
will
kill
him
her
voice
shook
with
emotion
he
can
not
revenge
himself
upon
your
brother
when
you
are
in
no
way
to
blame
i
said
angrily
we
arrested
you
you
are
not
here
of
your
own
free
will
she
drew
her
breath
sharply
clutching
at
my
arm
and
in
her
eyes
i
could
read
that
she
was
forcing
her
mind
to
some
arduous
decision
listen
she
was
speaking
rapidly
nervously
if
i
help
you
to
take
tell
you
where
he
is
to
be
found
alone
will
you
promise
me
solemnly
promise
me
that
you
will
immediately
go
to
the
place
where
i
shall
guide
you
and
release
my
brother
that
you
will
let
us
both
go
free
i
will
i
said
without
hesitation
you
may
rest
assured
of
it
but
there
is
a
condition
she
added
what
is
it
when
i
have
told
you
where
to
capture
him
you
must
release
me
i
hesitated
smith
often
had
accused
me
of
weakness
where
this
girl
was
concerned
what
now
was
my
plain
duty
that
she
would
utterly
decline
to
speak
under
any
circumstances
unless
it
suited
her
to
do
so
i
felt
assured
if
she
spoke
the
truth
in
her
proposed
bargain
there
was
no
personal
element
her
conduct
i
now
viewed
in
a
new
light
humanity
i
thought
dictated
that
i
accept
her
proposal
policy
also
i
agree
i
said
and
looked
into
her
eyes
which
were
aflame
now
with
emotion
an
excitement
perhaps
of
anticipation
perhaps
of
fear
she
laid
her
hands
upon
my
shoulders
you
will
be
careful
she
said
pleadingly
for
your
sake
i
replied
i
shall
not
for
my
sake
then
for
your
brother
no
her
voice
had
sunk
to
a
whisper
for
your
own
chapter
xvii
a
cool
breeze
met
us
blowing
from
the
lower
reaches
of
the
thames
far
behind
us
twinkled
the
dim
lights
of
low
cottages
the
last
regular
habitations
abutting
upon
the
marshes
between
us
and
the
cottages
stretched
of
lush
land
through
which
at
this
season
there
were
however
numerous
dry
paths
before
us
the
flats
again
a
dull
monotonous
expanse
beneath
the
moon
with
the
promise
of
the
cool
breeze
that
the
river
flowed
round
the
bend
ahead
it
was
very
quiet
only
the
sound
of
our
footsteps
as
nayland
smith
and
i
tramped
steadily
towards
our
goal
broke
the
stillness
of
that
lonely
place
not
once
but
many
times
within
the
last
twenty
minutes
i
had
thought
that
we
were
to
adventure
alone
upon
the
capture
of
the
formidable
chinese
doctor
but
we
were
following
out
our
compact
with
karamaneh
and
one
of
her
stipulations
had
been
that
the
police
must
not
be
acquainted
with
her
share
in
the
matter
a
light
came
into
view
far
ahead
of
us
that
the
light
petrie
said
smith
if
we
keep
that
straight
before
us
according
to
our
information
we
shall
strike
the
hulk
i
grasped
the
revolver
in
my
pocket
and
the
presence
of
the
little
weapon
was
curiously
reassuring
i
have
endeavored
perhaps
in
extenuation
of
my
own
fears
to
explain
how
about
there
rested
an
atmosphere
of
horror
peculiar
unique
he
was
not
as
other
men
the
dread
that
he
inspired
in
all
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
the
terrors
which
he
controlled
and
hurled
at
whomsoever
cumbered
his
path
rendered
him
an
object
supremely
sinister
i
despair
of
conveying
to
those
who
may
read
this
account
any
but
the
coldest
conception
of
the
man
evil
power
smith
stopped
suddenly
and
grasped
my
arm
we
stood
listening
what
i
asked
you
heard
nothing
i
shook
my
head
smith
was
peering
back
over
the
marshes
in
his
oddly
alert
way
he
turned
to
me
and
his
tanned
face
wore
a
peculiar
expression
you
do
think
it
a
trap
he
jerked
we
are
trusting
her
blindly
strange
it
may
seem
but
something
within
me
rose
in
arms
against
the
innuendo
i
do
i
said
shortly
he
nodded
we
pressed
on
ten
minutes
steady
tramping
brought
us
within
sight
of
the
thames
smith
and
i
both
had
noticed
how
activities
centered
always
about
the
london
river
undoubtedly
it
was
his
highway
his
line
of
communication
along
which
he
moved
his
mysterious
forces
the
opium
den
off
shadwell
highway
the
mansion
upstream
at
that
hour
a
smoldering
shell
now
the
hulk
lying
off
the
marshes
always
he
made
his
headquarters
upon
the
river
it
was
significant
and
even
if
expedition
should
fail
this
was
a
clew
for
our
future
guidance
bear
to
the
right
directed
smith
we
must
reconnoiter
before
making
our
attack
we
took
a
path
that
led
directly
to
the
river
bank
before
us
lay
the
gray
expanse
of
water
and
out
upon
it
moved
the
busy
shipping
of
the
great
mercantile
city
but
this
life
of
the
river
seemed
widely
removed
from
us
the
lonely
spot
where
we
stood
had
no
kinship
with
human
activity
its
dreariness
illuminated
by
the
brilliant
moon
it
looked
indeed
a
fit
setting
for
an
act
in
such
a
drama
as
that
wherein
we
played
our
parts
when
i
had
lain
in
the
east
end
opium
den
when
upon
such
another
night
as
this
i
had
looked
out
upon
a
peaceful
norfolk
countryside
the
same
knowledge
of
aloofness
of
utter
detachment
from
the
world
of
living
men
had
come
to
me
silently
smith
stared
out
at
the
distant
moving
lights
karamaneh
merely
means
a
slave
he
said
irrelevantly
i
made
no
comment
there
the
hulk
he
added
the
bank
upon
which
we
stood
dipped
in
mud
slopes
to
the
level
of
the
running
tide
seaward
it
rose
higher
and
by
a
narrow
inlet
for
we
perceived
that
we
were
upon
a
kind
of
promontory
a
rough
pier
showed
beneath
it
was
a
shadowy
shape
in
the
patch
of
gloom
which
the
moon
threw
far
out
upon
the
softly
eddying
water
only
one
dim
light
was
visible
amid
this
darkness
that
will
be
the
cabin
said
smith
acting
upon
our
prearranged
plan
we
turned
and
walked
up
on
to
the
staging
above
the
hulk
a
wooden
ladder
led
out
and
down
to
the
deck
below
and
was
loosely
lashed
to
a
ring
on
the
pier
with
every
motion
of
the
tidal
waters
the
ladder
rose
and
fell
its
rings
creaking
harshly
against
the
crazy
railing
how
are
we
going
to
get
down
without
being
detected
whispered
smith
we
got
to
risk
it
i
said
grimly
without
further
words
my
friend
climbed
around
on
to
the
ladder
and
commenced
to
descend
i
waited
until
his
head
disappeared
below
the
level
and
clumsily
enough
prepared
to
follow
him
the
hulk
at
that
moment
giving
an
unusually
heavy
heave
i
stumbled
and
for
one
breathless
moment
looked
down
upon
the
glittering
surface
streaking
the
darkness
beneath
me
my
foot
had
slipped
and
but
that
i
had
a
firm
grip
upon
the
top
rung
that
instant
most
probably
had
marked
the
end
of
my
share
in
the
fight
with
as
it
was
i
had
a
narrow
escape
i
felt
something
slip
from
my
hip
pocket
but
the
weird
creaking
of
the
ladder
the
groans
of
the
laboring
hulk
and
the
lapping
of
the
waves
about
the
staging
drowned
the
sound
of
the
splash
as
my
revolver
dropped
into
the
river
rather
i
think
i
joined
smith
on
the
deck
he
had
witnessed
my
accident
but
we
must
risk
it
he
whispered
in
my
ear
we
dare
not
turn
back
now
he
plunged
into
the
making
for
the
cabin
i
perforce
following
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
we
came
fully
into
the
light
streaming
out
from
the
singular
apartments
at
the
entrance
to
which
we
found
ourselves
it
was
fitted
up
as
a
laboratory
a
glimpse
i
had
of
shelves
loaded
with
jars
and
bottles
of
a
table
strewn
with
scientific
paraphernalia
with
retorts
with
tubes
of
extraordinary
shapes
holding
living
organisms
and
with
instruments
some
of
them
of
a
form
unknown
to
my
experience
i
saw
too
that
books
papers
and
rolls
of
parchment
littered
the
bare
wooden
floor
then
smith
voice
rose
above
the
confused
sounds
about
me
incisive
commanding
i
have
you
covered
dr
for
sat
at
the
table
the
picture
that
he
presented
at
that
moment
is
one
which
persistently
clings
in
my
memory
in
his
long
yellow
robe
his
masklike
intellectual
face
bent
forward
amongst
the
riot
of
singular
objects
upon
the
table
his
great
high
brow
gleaming
in
the
light
of
the
shaded
lamp
above
him
and
with
the
abnormal
eyes
filmed
and
green
raised
to
us
he
seemed
a
figure
from
the
realms
of
delirium
but
most
amazing
circumstance
of
all
he
and
his
surroundings
tallied
almost
identically
with
the
which
had
come
to
me
as
i
lay
chained
in
the
cell
some
of
the
large
jars
about
the
place
held
anatomy
specimens
a
faint
smell
of
opium
hung
in
the
air
and
playing
with
the
tassel
of
one
of
the
cushions
upon
which
as
upon
a
divan
was
seated
leaped
and
chattered
a
little
marmoset
that
was
an
electric
moment
i
was
prepared
for
anything
for
anything
except
for
what
really
happened
the
doctor
wonderful
evil
face
betrayed
no
hint
of
emotion
the
lids
flickered
over
the
filmed
eyes
and
their
greenness
grew
momentarily
brighter
and
filmed
over
again
put
up
your
hands
rapped
smith
and
attempt
no
tricks
his
voice
quivered
with
excitement
the
game
up
find
something
to
tie
him
up
with
petrie
i
moved
forward
to
smith
side
and
was
about
to
pass
him
in
the
narrow
doorway
the
hulk
moved
beneath
our
feet
like
a
living
thing
groaning
creaking
and
the
water
lapped
about
the
rotten
woodwork
with
a
sound
infinitely
dreary
put
up
your
hands
ordered
smith
imperatively
slowly
raised
his
hands
and
a
smile
dawned
upon
the
impassive
features
a
smile
that
had
no
mirth
in
it
only
menace
revealing
as
it
did
his
even
discolored
teeth
but
leaving
the
filmed
eyes
inanimate
dull
inhuman
he
spoke
softly
sibilantly
i
would
advise
petrie
to
glance
behind
him
before
he
moves
smith
keen
gray
eyes
never
for
a
moment
quitted
the
speaker
the
gleaming
barrel
moved
not
a
but
i
glanced
quickly
over
my
shoulder
and
stifled
a
cry
of
pure
horror
a
wicked
face
with
wolfish
fangs
bared
and
jaundiced
eyes
squinting
obliquely
into
mine
was
within
two
inches
of
me
a
lean
brown
hand
and
arm
the
great
thews
standing
up
like
cords
held
a
knife
a
fraction
of
an
inch
above
my
jugular
vein
a
slight
movement
must
have
dispatched
me
a
sweep
of
the
fearful
weapon
i
doubt
not
would
have
severed
my
head
from
my
body
smith
i
whispered
hoarsely
do
look
around
for
god
sake
keep
him
covered
but
a
dacoit
has
his
knife
at
my
throat
then
for
the
first
time
smith
hand
trembled
but
his
glance
never
wavered
from
the
malignant
emotionless
countenance
of
he
clenched
his
teeth
hard
so
that
the
muscles
stood
out
prominently
upon
his
jaw
i
suppose
that
silence
which
followed
my
awful
discovery
prevailed
but
a
few
seconds
to
me
those
seconds
were
each
a
lingering
death
there
below
in
that
groaning
hulk
i
knew
more
of
icy
terror
than
any
of
our
meetings
with
the
had
brought
to
me
before
and
through
my
brain
throbbed
a
thought
the
girl
had
betrayed
us
you
supposed
that
i
was
alone
suggested
so
i
was
yet
no
trace
of
fear
had
broken
through
the
impassive
yellow
mask
when
we
had
entered
but
my
faithful
servant
followed
you
he
added
i
thank
him
the
honors
smith
are
mine
i
think
smith
made
no
reply
i
divined
that
he
was
thinking
furiously
moved
his
hand
to
caress
the
marmoset
which
had
leaped
playfully
upon
his
shoulder
and
crouched
there
gibing
at
us
in
a
whistling
voice
do
stir
said
smith
savagely
i
warn
you
kept
his
hand
raised
may
i
ask
you
how
you
discovered
my
retreat
he
asked
this
hulk
has
been
watched
since
dawn
lied
smith
brazenly
so
the
doctor
filmed
eyes
cleared
for
a
moment
and
you
compelled
me
to
burn
a
house
and
you
have
captured
one
of
my
people
too
i
congratulate
you
she
would
not
betray
me
though
lashed
with
scorpions
the
great
gleaming
knife
was
so
near
to
my
neck
that
a
sheet
of
notepaper
could
scarcely
have
been
slipped
between
blade
and
vein
i
think
but
my
heart
throbbed
even
more
wildly
when
i
heard
those
words
an
impasse
said
i
have
a
proposal
to
make
i
assume
that
you
would
not
accept
my
word
for
anything
i
would
not
replied
smith
promptly
therefore
pursued
the
chinaman
and
the
occasional
guttural
alone
marred
his
perfect
english
i
must
accept
yours
of
your
resources
outside
this
cabin
i
know
nothing
you
i
take
it
know
as
little
of
mine
my
burmese
friend
and
doctor
petrie
will
lead
the
way
then
you
and
i
will
follow
we
will
strike
out
across
the
marsh
for
say
three
hundred
yards
you
will
then
place
your
pistol
on
the
ground
pledging
me
your
word
to
leave
it
there
i
shall
further
require
your
assurance
that
you
will
make
no
attempt
upon
me
until
i
have
retraced
my
steps
i
and
my
good
servant
will
withdraw
leaving
you
at
the
expiration
of
the
specified
period
to
act
as
you
see
fit
is
it
agreed
smith
hesitated
then
the
dacoit
must
leave
his
knife
also
he
stipulated
smiled
his
evil
smile
again
agreed
shall
i
lead
the
way
no
rapped
smith
petrie
and
the
dacoit
first
then
you
i
last
a
guttural
word
of
command
from
and
we
left
the
cabin
with
its
evil
odors
its
mortuary
specimens
and
its
strange
instruments
and
in
the
order
arranged
mounted
to
the
deck
it
will
be
awkward
on
the
ladder
said
petrie
i
will
accept
your
word
to
adhere
to
the
terms
i
promise
i
said
the
words
almost
choking
me
we
mounted
the
rising
and
dipping
ladder
all
reached
the
pier
and
strode
out
across
the
flats
the
chinaman
always
under
close
cover
of
smith
revolver
round
about
our
feet
now
leaping
ahead
now
gamboling
back
came
and
went
the
marmoset
the
dacoit
dressed
solely
in
a
dark
walked
beside
me
carrying
his
huge
knife
and
sometimes
glancing
at
me
with
his
eyes
never
before
i
venture
to
say
had
an
autumn
moon
lighted
such
a
scene
in
that
place
here
we
part
said
and
spoke
another
word
to
his
follower
the
man
threw
his
knife
upon
the
ground
search
him
petrie
directed
smith
he
may
have
a
second
concealed
the
doctor
consented
and
i
passed
my
hands
over
the
man
scanty
garments
now
search
this
also
i
did
and
never
have
i
experienced
a
similar
sense
of
revulsion
from
any
human
being
i
shuddered
as
though
i
had
touched
a
venomous
reptile
smith
threw
down
his
revolver
i
curse
myself
for
an
honorable
fool
he
said
no
one
could
dispute
my
right
to
shoot
you
dead
where
you
stand
knowing
him
as
i
did
i
could
tell
from
the
suppressed
passion
in
smith
voice
that
only
by
his
unhesitating
acceptance
of
my
word
and
implicit
faith
in
his
keeping
it
had
escaped
just
retribution
at
that
moment
fiend
though
he
was
i
admired
his
courage
for
all
this
he
too
must
have
known
the
doctor
turned
and
with
the
dacoit
walked
back
nayland
next
move
filled
me
with
surprise
for
just
as
silently
i
was
thanking
god
for
my
escape
my
friend
began
shedding
his
coat
collar
and
waistcoat
pocket
your
valuables
and
do
the
same
he
muttered
hoarsely
we
have
a
poor
chance
but
we
are
both
fairly
fit
petrie
we
literally
have
to
run
for
our
lives
we
live
in
a
peaceful
age
wherein
it
falls
to
the
lot
of
few
men
to
owe
their
survival
to
their
fleetness
of
foot
at
smith
words
i
realized
in
a
flash
that
such
was
to
be
our
fate
i
have
said
that
the
hulk
lay
off
a
sort
of
promontory
east
and
west
then
we
had
nothing
to
hope
for
to
the
south
was
and
even
as
stripped
of
our
heavier
garments
we
started
to
run
northward
the
weird
signal
of
a
dacoit
rose
on
the
night
and
was
answered
was
answered
again
three
at
least
hissed
smith
three
armed
dacoits
hopeless
take
the
revolver
i
cried
smith
it
no
he
rapped
through
clenched
teeth
a
servant
of
the
crown
in
the
east
makes
his
motto
your
word
though
it
break
your
neck
i
do
think
we
need
fear
it
being
used
against
us
avoids
noisy
methods
so
back
we
ran
over
the
course
by
which
earlier
we
had
come
it
was
roughly
a
mile
to
the
first
building
a
deserted
cottage
and
another
quarter
of
a
mile
to
any
that
was
occupied
our
chance
of
meeting
a
living
soul
other
than
dacoits
was
practically
nil
at
first
we
ran
easily
for
it
was
the
second
that
would
decide
our
fate
the
professional
murderers
who
pursued
us
ran
like
panthers
i
knew
and
i
dare
not
allow
my
mind
to
dwell
upon
those
yellow
figures
with
the
curved
gleaming
knives
for
a
long
time
neither
of
us
looked
back
on
we
ran
and
on
silently
doggedly
then
a
hissing
breath
from
smith
warned
me
what
to
expect
should
i
too
look
back
yes
it
was
impossible
to
resist
the
horrid
fascination
i
threw
a
quick
glance
over
my
shoulder
and
never
while
i
live
shall
i
forget
what
i
saw
two
of
the
pursuing
dacoits
had
outdistanced
their
fellow
or
fellows
and
were
actually
within
three
hundred
yards
of
us
more
like
dreadful
animals
they
looked
than
human
beings
running
bent
forward
with
their
faces
curiously
uptilted
the
brilliant
moonlight
gleamed
upon
bared
teeth
as
i
could
see
even
at
that
distance
even
in
that
quick
agonized
glance
and
it
gleamed
upon
the
knives
as
hard
as
you
can
go
now
panted
smith
we
must
make
an
attempt
to
break
into
the
empty
cottage
only
chance
i
had
never
in
my
younger
days
been
a
notable
runner
for
smith
i
can
not
speak
but
i
am
confident
that
the
next
was
done
in
time
that
would
not
have
disgraced
a
crack
man
not
once
again
did
either
of
us
look
back
yard
upon
yard
we
raced
forward
together
my
heart
seemed
to
be
bursting
my
leg
muscles
throbbed
with
pain
at
last
with
the
empty
cottage
in
sight
it
came
to
that
pass
with
me
when
another
three
yards
looks
as
unattainable
as
three
miles
once
i
stumbled
my
god
came
from
smith
weakly
but
i
recovered
myself
bare
feet
pattered
close
upon
our
heels
and
panting
breaths
told
how
even
bloodhounds
were
hard
put
to
it
by
the
killing
pace
we
had
made
smith
i
whispered
look
in
front
someone
as
through
a
red
mist
i
had
seen
a
dark
shape
detach
itself
from
the
shadows
of
the
cottage
and
merge
into
them
again
it
could
only
be
another
dacoit
but
smith
not
heeding
or
not
hearing
my
faintly
whispered
words
crashed
open
the
gate
and
hurled
himself
blindly
at
the
door
it
burst
open
before
him
with
a
resounding
boom
and
he
pitched
forward
into
the
interior
darkness
flat
upon
the
floor
he
lay
for
as
with
a
last
effort
i
gained
the
threshold
and
dragged
myself
within
i
almost
fell
over
his
recumbent
body
madly
i
snatched
at
the
door
his
foot
held
it
open
i
kicked
the
foot
away
and
banged
the
door
to
as
i
turned
the
leading
dacoit
his
eyes
starting
from
their
sockets
his
face
the
face
of
a
demon
leaped
wildly
through
the
gateway
that
smith
had
burst
the
latch
i
felt
assured
but
by
some
divine
accident
my
weak
hands
found
the
bolt
with
the
last
ounce
of
strength
spared
to
me
i
thrust
it
home
in
the
rusty
socket
as
a
full
six
inches
of
shining
steel
split
the
middle
panel
and
protruded
above
my
head
i
dropped
sprawling
beside
my
friend
a
terrific
blow
shattered
every
pane
of
glass
in
the
solitary
window
and
one
of
the
grinning
animal
faces
looked
in
sorry
old
man
whispered
smith
and
his
voice
was
barely
audible
weakly
he
grasped
my
hand
my
fault
i
should
have
let
you
come
from
the
corner
of
the
room
where
the
black
shadows
lay
flicked
a
long
tongue
of
flame
muffled
staccato
came
the
report
and
the
yellow
face
at
the
window
was
blotted
out
one
wild
cry
ending
in
a
rattling
gasp
told
of
a
dacoit
gone
to
his
account
a
gray
figure
glided
past
me
and
was
silhouetted
against
the
broken
window
again
the
pistol
sent
its
message
into
the
night
and
again
came
the
reply
to
tell
how
well
and
truly
that
message
had
been
delivered
in
the
stillness
intense
by
sharp
contrast
the
sound
of
bare
soles
pattering
upon
the
path
outside
stole
to
me
two
runners
i
thought
there
were
so
that
four
dacoits
must
have
been
upon
our
trail
the
room
was
full
of
pungent
smoke
i
staggered
to
my
feet
as
the
gray
figure
with
the
revolver
turned
towards
me
something
familiar
there
was
in
that
long
gray
garment
and
now
i
perceived
why
i
had
thought
so
it
was
my
gray
karamaneh
i
whispered
and
smith
with
difficulty
supporting
himself
upright
and
holding
fast
to
the
ledge
beside
the
door
muttered
something
hoarsely
which
sounded
like
god
bless
her
the
girl
trembling
now
placed
her
hands
upon
my
shoulders
with
that
quaint
pathetic
gesture
peculiarly
her
own
i
followed
you
she
said
did
you
not
know
i
should
follow
you
but
i
had
to
hide
because
of
another
who
was
following
also
i
had
but
just
reached
this
place
when
i
saw
you
running
towards
me
she
broke
off
and
turned
to
smith
this
is
your
pistol
she
said
naively
i
found
it
in
your
bag
will
you
please
take
it
he
took
it
without
a
word
perhaps
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
speak
now
go
hurry
she
said
you
are
not
safe
yet
but
you
i
asked
you
have
failed
she
replied
i
must
go
back
to
him
there
is
no
other
way
strangely
sick
at
heart
for
a
man
who
has
just
had
a
miraculous
escape
from
death
i
opened
the
door
coatless
disheveled
figures
my
friend
and
i
stepped
out
into
the
moonlight
hideous
under
the
pale
rays
lay
the
two
dead
men
their
glazed
eyes
upcast
to
the
peace
of
the
blue
heavens
karamaneh
had
shot
to
kill
for
both
had
bullets
in
their
brains
if
god
ever
planned
a
more
complex
nature
than
hers
a
nature
more
tumultuous
with
conflicting
passions
i
can
not
conceive
of
it
yet
her
beauty
was
of
the
sweetest
and
in
some
respects
she
had
the
heart
of
a
child
this
girl
who
could
shoot
so
straight
we
must
send
the
police
said
smith
or
the
papers
hurry
came
the
girl
voice
commandingly
from
the
darkness
of
the
cottage
it
was
a
singular
situation
my
very
soul
rebelled
against
it
but
what
could
we
do
tell
us
where
we
can
communicate
began
smith
hurry
i
shall
be
suspected
do
you
want
him
to
kill
me
we
moved
away
all
was
very
still
now
and
the
lights
glimmered
faintly
ahead
not
a
wisp
of
cloud
brushed
the
moon
disk
karamaneh
i
whispered
softly
chapter
xviii
to
pursue
further
the
adventure
on
the
marshes
would
be
a
task
at
once
useless
and
thankless
in
its
actual
and
in
its
dramatic
significance
it
concluded
with
our
parting
from
karamaneh
and
in
that
parting
i
learned
what
shakespeare
meant
by
sweet
sorrow
there
was
a
world
i
learned
upon
the
confines
of
which
i
stood
a
world
whose
very
existence
hitherto
had
been
unsuspected
not
the
least
of
the
mysteries
which
peeped
from
the
darkness
was
the
mystery
of
the
heart
of
karamaneh
i
sought
to
forget
her
i
sought
to
remember
her
indeed
in
the
latter
task
i
found
one
more
congenial
yet
in
the
direction
and
extent
of
the
ideas
which
it
engendered
one
that
led
me
to
a
precipice
east
and
west
may
not
intermingle
as
a
student
of
as
a
physician
i
admitted
could
not
deny
that
truth
again
if
karamaneh
were
to
be
credited
she
had
come
to
a
slave
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
raiders
had
crossed
the
desert
with
the
had
known
the
house
of
the
could
it
be
with
the
fading
of
the
crescent
of
islam
i
had
thought
such
things
to
have
passed
but
if
it
were
so
at
the
mere
thought
of
a
girl
so
deliciously
beautiful
in
the
brutal
power
of
slavers
i
found
myself
grinding
my
teeth
closing
my
eyes
in
a
futile
attempt
to
blot
out
the
pictures
called
up
then
at
such
times
i
would
find
myself
discrediting
her
story
again
i
would
find
myself
wondering
vaguely
why
such
problems
persistently
haunted
my
mind
but
always
my
heart
had
an
answer
and
i
was
a
medical
man
who
sought
to
build
up
a
family
practice
who
in
short
a
very
little
time
ago
had
thought
himself
past
the
hot
follies
of
youth
and
entered
upon
that
staid
phase
of
life
wherein
the
daily
problems
of
the
medical
profession
hold
absolute
sway
and
such
seductive
follies
as
dark
eyes
and
red
lips
find
no
place
are
excluded
but
it
is
foreign
from
the
purpose
of
this
plain
record
to
enlist
sympathy
for
the
recorder
the
topic
upon
which
here
i
have
ventured
to
touch
was
one
fascinating
enough
to
me
i
can
not
hope
that
it
holds
equal
charm
for
any
other
let
us
return
to
that
which
it
is
my
duty
to
narrate
and
let
us
forget
my
brief
digression
it
is
a
fact
singular
but
true
that
few
londoners
know
london
under
the
guidance
of
my
friend
nayland
smith
i
had
learned
since
his
return
from
burma
how
there
are
haunts
in
the
very
heart
of
the
metropolis
whose
existence
is
unsuspected
by
all
but
the
few
places
unknown
even
to
the
ubiquitous
pressman
into
a
quiet
thoroughfare
not
two
minutes
walk
from
the
pulsing
life
of
leicester
square
smith
led
the
way
before
a
door
sandwiched
in
between
two
dingy
he
paused
and
turned
to
me
whatever
you
see
or
hear
he
cautioned
express
no
surprise
a
cab
had
dropped
us
at
the
corner
we
both
wore
dark
suits
and
fez
caps
with
black
silk
tassels
my
complexion
had
been
artificially
reduced
to
a
shade
resembling
the
deep
tan
of
my
friend
he
rang
the
bell
beside
the
door
almost
immediately
it
was
opened
by
a
negro
woman
gross
hideously
ugly
smith
uttered
something
in
voluble
arabic
as
a
linguist
his
attainments
were
a
constant
source
of
surprise
the
jargons
of
the
east
far
and
near
he
spoke
as
his
mother
tongue
the
woman
immediately
displayed
the
utmost
servility
ushering
us
into
an
passage
with
every
evidence
of
profound
respect
following
this
passage
and
passing
an
inner
door
from
beyond
whence
proceeded
bursts
of
discordant
music
we
entered
a
little
room
bare
of
furniture
with
coarse
matting
for
mural
decorations
and
a
patternless
red
carpet
on
the
floor
in
a
niche
burned
a
common
metal
lamp
the
negress
left
us
and
close
upon
her
departure
entered
a
very
aged
man
with
a
long
patriarchal
beard
who
greeted
my
friend
with
dignified
courtesy
following
a
brief
conversation
the
aged
arab
for
such
he
appeared
to
be
drew
aside
a
strip
of
matting
revealing
a
dark
recess
placing
his
finger
upon
his
lips
he
silently
invited
us
to
enter
we
did
so
and
the
mat
was
dropped
behind
us
the
sounds
of
crude
music
were
now
much
plainer
and
as
smith
slipped
a
little
shutter
aside
i
gave
a
start
of
surprise
beyond
lay
a
fairly
large
apartment
having
divans
or
low
seats
around
three
of
its
walls
these
divans
were
occupied
by
a
motley
company
of
turks
egyptians
greeks
and
others
and
i
noted
two
chinese
most
of
them
smoked
cigarettes
and
some
were
drinking
a
girl
was
performing
a
sinuous
dance
upon
the
square
carpet
occupying
the
center
of
the
floor
accompanied
by
a
young
negro
woman
upon
a
guitar
and
by
several
members
of
the
assembly
who
clapped
their
hands
to
the
music
or
hummed
a
low
monotonous
melody
shortly
after
our
entrance
into
the
passage
the
dance
terminated
and
the
dancer
fled
through
a
curtained
door
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
a
buzz
of
conversation
arose
it
is
a
sort
of
combined
wekaleh
and
place
of
entertainment
for
a
certain
class
of
oriental
residents
in
or
visiting
london
smith
whispered
the
old
gentleman
who
has
just
left
us
is
the
proprietor
or
host
i
have
been
here
before
on
several
occasions
but
have
always
drawn
blank
he
was
peering
out
eagerly
into
the
strange
clubroom
whom
do
you
expect
to
find
here
i
asked
it
is
a
recognized
said
smith
in
my
ear
it
is
almost
a
certainty
that
some
of
the
group
use
it
at
times
curiously
i
surveyed
all
these
faces
which
were
visible
from
the
my
eyes
rested
particularly
upon
the
two
chinamen
do
you
recognize
anyone
i
whispered
smith
was
craning
his
neck
so
as
to
command
a
sight
of
the
doorway
he
obstructed
my
view
and
only
by
his
tense
attitude
and
some
subtle
wave
of
excitement
which
he
communicated
to
me
did
i
know
that
a
new
arrival
was
entering
the
hum
of
conversation
died
away
and
in
the
ensuing
silence
i
heard
the
rustle
of
draperies
the
newcomer
was
a
woman
then
fearful
of
making
any
noise
i
yet
managed
to
get
my
eyes
to
the
level
of
the
shutter
a
woman
in
an
elegant
opera
cloak
was
crossing
the
floor
and
coming
in
the
direction
of
the
spot
where
we
were
concealed
she
wore
a
soft
silk
scarf
about
her
head
a
fold
partly
draped
across
her
face
a
momentary
view
i
had
of
her
and
wildly
incongruous
she
looked
in
that
place
and
she
had
disappeared
from
sight
having
approached
someone
invisible
who
sat
upon
the
divan
immediately
beneath
our
point
of
vantage
from
the
way
in
which
the
company
gazed
towards
her
i
divined
that
she
was
no
habitue
of
the
place
but
that
her
presence
there
was
as
greatly
surprising
to
those
in
the
room
as
it
was
to
me
whom
could
she
be
this
elegant
lady
who
visited
such
a
haunt
who
it
would
seem
was
so
anxious
to
disguise
her
identity
but
who
was
dressed
for
a
society
function
rather
than
for
a
midnight
expedition
of
so
unusual
a
character
i
began
a
whispered
question
but
smith
tugged
at
my
arm
to
silence
me
his
excitement
was
intense
had
his
keener
powers
enabled
him
to
recognize
the
unknown
a
faint
but
most
peculiar
perfume
stole
to
my
nostrils
a
perfume
which
seemed
to
contain
the
very
soul
of
eastern
mystery
only
one
woman
known
to
me
used
that
perfume
karamaneh
then
it
was
she
at
last
my
friend
vigilance
had
been
rewarded
eagerly
i
bent
forward
smith
literally
quivered
in
anticipation
of
a
discovery
again
the
strange
perfume
was
wafted
to
our
and
glancing
neither
to
right
nor
left
i
saw
karamaneh
for
that
it
was
she
i
no
longer
doubted
recross
the
room
and
disappear
the
man
she
spoke
to
hissed
smith
we
must
see
him
we
must
have
him
he
pulled
the
mat
aside
and
stepped
out
into
the
anteroom
it
was
empty
down
the
passage
he
led
and
we
were
almost
come
to
the
door
of
the
big
room
when
it
was
thrown
open
and
a
man
came
rapidly
out
opened
the
street
door
before
smith
could
reach
him
and
was
gone
slamming
it
fast
i
can
swear
that
we
were
not
four
seconds
behind
him
but
when
we
gained
the
street
it
was
empty
our
quarry
had
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
a
big
car
was
just
turning
the
corner
towards
leicester
square
that
is
the
girl
rapped
smith
but
where
in
heaven
name
is
the
man
to
whom
she
brought
the
message
i
would
give
a
hundred
pounds
to
know
what
business
is
afoot
to
think
that
we
have
had
such
an
opportunity
and
have
thrown
it
away
angry
and
nonplused
he
stood
at
the
corner
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
crowded
thoroughfare
into
which
the
car
had
been
driven
tugging
at
the
lobe
of
his
ear
as
was
his
habit
in
such
moments
of
perplexity
and
sharply
clicking
his
teeth
together
i
too
was
very
thoughtful
clews
were
few
enough
in
those
days
of
our
war
with
that
giant
antagonist
the
mere
thought
that
our
trifling
error
of
judgment
tonight
in
tarrying
a
moment
too
long
might
mean
the
victory
of
might
mean
the
turning
of
the
balance
which
a
wise
providence
had
adjusted
between
the
white
and
yellow
races
was
appalling
to
smith
and
me
who
knew
something
of
the
secret
influences
at
work
to
overthrow
the
indian
empire
to
place
it
might
be
the
whole
of
europe
and
america
beneath
an
eastern
rule
it
seemed
that
a
great
yellow
hand
was
stretched
out
over
london
doctor
was
a
menace
to
the
civilized
world
yet
his
very
existence
remained
unsuspected
by
the
millions
whose
fate
he
sought
to
command
into
what
dark
scheme
have
we
had
a
glimpse
said
smith
what
state
secret
is
to
be
filched
what
faithful
servant
of
the
british
raj
to
be
spirited
away
upon
whom
now
has
set
his
death
seal
karamaneh
on
this
occasion
may
not
have
been
acting
as
an
emissary
of
the
doctor
i
feel
assured
that
she
was
petrie
of
the
many
whom
this
yellow
cloud
may
at
any
moment
envelop
to
which
one
did
her
message
refer
the
man
instructions
were
urgent
witness
his
hasty
departure
curse
it
he
dashed
his
right
clenched
fist
into
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
i
never
had
a
glimpse
of
his
face
first
to
last
to
think
of
the
hours
i
have
spent
in
that
place
in
anticipation
of
just
such
a
meeting
only
to
bungle
the
opportunity
when
it
arose
scarce
heeding
what
course
we
followed
we
had
come
now
to
piccadilly
circus
and
had
walked
out
into
the
heart
of
the
night
traffic
i
just
dragged
smith
aside
in
time
to
save
him
from
the
wheel
of
a
big
mercedes
then
the
traffic
was
blocked
and
we
found
ourselves
dangerously
penned
in
amidst
the
press
of
vehicles
somehow
we
extricated
ourselves
jeered
at
by
who
naturally
took
us
for
two
simple
oriental
visitors
and
just
before
that
impassable
barrier
the
arm
of
a
london
policeman
was
lowered
and
the
stream
moved
on
a
faint
breath
of
perfume
became
perceptible
to
me
the
cabs
and
cars
about
us
were
actually
beginning
to
move
again
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
a
hasty
retreat
to
the
curb
i
could
not
pause
to
glance
behind
but
instinctively
i
knew
that
someone
someone
who
used
that
rare
fragrant
essence
was
leaning
from
the
window
of
the
car
andaman
second
floated
a
soft
whisper
we
gained
the
pavement
as
the
traffic
roared
upon
its
way
smith
had
not
noticed
the
perfume
worn
by
the
unseen
occupant
of
the
car
had
not
detected
the
whispered
words
but
i
had
no
reason
to
doubt
my
senses
and
i
knew
beyond
question
that
lovely
slave
karamaneh
had
been
within
a
yard
of
us
had
recognized
us
and
had
uttered
those
words
for
our
guidance
on
regaining
my
rooms
we
devoted
a
whole
hour
to
considering
what
andaman
second
could
possibly
mean
hang
it
all
cried
smith
it
might
mean
anything
the
result
of
a
race
for
instance
he
burst
into
one
of
his
rare
laughs
and
began
to
stuff
broadcut
mixture
into
his
briar
i
could
see
that
he
had
no
intention
of
turning
in
i
can
think
of
no
one
no
one
of
note
in
london
at
present
upon
whom
it
is
likely
that
would
make
an
attempt
he
said
except
ourselves
we
began
methodically
to
go
through
the
long
list
of
names
which
we
had
compiled
and
to
review
our
elaborate
notes
when
at
last
i
turned
in
the
night
had
given
place
to
a
new
day
but
sleep
evaded
me
and
andaman
second
danced
like
a
mocking
phantom
through
my
brain
then
i
heard
the
telephone
bell
i
heard
smith
speaking
a
minute
afterwards
he
was
in
my
room
his
face
very
grim
i
knew
as
well
as
if
i
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
that
some
black
business
was
afoot
last
night
he
said
and
it
was
within
of
us
someone
has
got
at
frank
norris
west
inspector
weymouth
has
just
been
on
the
norris
west
i
cried
the
american
aviator
and
inventor
of
the
west
yes
he
been
offering
it
to
the
english
war
office
and
they
have
delayed
too
long
i
got
out
of
bed
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
the
potentialities
have
attracted
the
attention
of
dr
those
words
operated
electrically
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
was
in
dressing
how
long
a
time
elapsed
ere
the
cab
for
which
smith
had
arrived
how
many
precious
minutes
were
lost
upon
the
journey
but
in
a
nervous
whirl
these
things
slipped
into
the
past
like
the
telegraph
poles
seen
from
the
window
of
an
express
and
still
in
that
tense
state
we
came
upon
the
scene
of
this
newest
outrage
norris
west
whose
lean
stoic
face
had
latterly
figured
so
often
in
the
daily
press
lay
upon
the
floor
in
the
little
entrance
hall
of
his
chambers
flat
upon
his
back
with
the
telephone
receiver
in
his
hand
the
outer
door
had
been
forced
by
the
police
they
had
had
to
remove
a
piece
of
the
paneling
to
get
at
the
bolt
a
medical
man
was
leaning
over
the
recumbent
figure
in
the
striped
pajama
suit
and
weymouth
stood
watching
him
as
smith
and
i
entered
he
has
been
heavily
drugged
said
the
doctor
sniffing
at
lips
but
i
can
not
say
what
drug
has
been
used
it
is
chloroform
or
anything
of
that
nature
he
can
safely
be
left
to
sleep
it
off
i
think
i
agreed
after
a
brief
examination
it
most
extraordinary
said
weymouth
he
rang
up
the
yard
about
an
hour
ago
and
said
his
chambers
had
been
invaded
by
chinamen
then
the
man
at
the
plainly
heard
him
fall
when
we
got
here
his
front
door
was
bolted
as
you
seen
and
the
windows
are
three
floors
up
nothing
is
disturbed
the
plans
of
the
rapped
smith
i
take
it
they
are
in
the
safe
in
his
bedroom
replied
the
detective
and
that
is
locked
all
right
i
think
he
must
have
taken
an
overdose
of
something
and
had
illusions
but
in
case
there
was
anything
in
what
he
mumbled
you
could
hardly
understand
him
i
thought
it
as
well
to
send
for
you
quite
right
said
smith
rapidly
his
eyes
shone
like
steel
lay
him
on
the
bed
inspector
it
was
done
and
my
friend
walked
into
the
bedroom
save
that
the
bed
was
disordered
showing
that
west
had
been
sleeping
in
it
there
were
no
evidences
of
the
extraordinary
invasion
mentioned
by
the
drugged
man
it
was
a
small
room
the
chambers
were
of
that
kind
which
are
let
furnished
and
very
neat
a
safe
with
a
combination
lock
stood
in
a
corner
the
window
was
open
about
a
foot
at
the
top
smith
tried
the
safe
and
found
it
fast
he
stood
for
a
moment
clicking
his
teeth
together
by
which
i
knew
him
to
be
perplexed
he
walked
over
to
the
window
and
threw
it
up
we
both
looked
out
you
see
came
weymouth
voice
it
is
altogether
too
far
from
the
court
below
for
our
cunning
chinese
friends
to
have
fixed
a
ladder
with
one
of
their
bamboo
rod
arrangements
and
even
if
they
could
get
up
there
it
too
far
down
from
the
roof
two
more
stories
for
them
to
have
fixed
it
from
there
smith
nodded
thoughtfully
at
the
same
time
trying
the
strength
of
an
iron
bar
which
ran
from
side
to
side
of
the
suddenly
he
stooped
with
a
sharp
exclamation
bending
over
his
shoulder
i
saw
what
it
was
that
had
attracted
his
attention
clearly
imprinted
upon
the
gray
stone
of
the
sill
was
a
confused
series
of
marks
tracks
call
them
what
you
will
smith
straightened
himself
and
turned
a
wondering
look
upon
me
what
is
it
petrie
he
said
amazedly
some
kind
of
bird
has
been
here
and
recently
inspector
weymouth
in
turn
examined
the
marks
i
never
saw
bird
tracks
like
these
smith
he
muttered
smith
was
tugging
at
the
lobe
of
his
ear
no
he
returned
reflectively
come
to
think
of
it
neither
did
i
he
twisted
around
looking
at
the
man
on
the
bed
do
you
think
it
was
all
an
illusion
asked
the
detective
what
about
those
marks
on
the
jerked
smith
he
began
restlessly
pacing
about
the
room
sometimes
stopping
before
the
locked
safe
and
frequently
glancing
at
norris
west
suddenly
he
walked
out
and
briefly
examined
the
other
apartments
only
to
return
again
to
the
bedroom
petrie
he
said
we
are
losing
valuable
time
west
must
be
aroused
inspector
weymouth
stared
smith
turned
to
me
impatiently
the
doctor
summoned
by
the
police
had
gone
is
there
no
means
of
arousing
him
petrie
he
said
doubtless
i
replied
he
could
be
revived
if
one
but
knew
what
drug
he
had
taken
my
friend
began
his
restless
pacing
again
and
suddenly
pounced
upon
a
little
phial
of
tabloids
which
had
been
hidden
behind
some
books
on
a
shelf
near
the
bed
he
uttered
a
triumphant
exclamation
see
what
we
have
here
petrie
he
directed
handing
the
phial
to
me
it
bears
no
label
i
crushed
one
of
the
tabloids
in
my
palm
and
applied
my
tongue
to
the
powder
some
preparation
of
chloral
hydrate
i
pronounced
a
sleeping
draught
suggested
smith
eagerly
we
might
try
i
said
and
scribbled
a
formula
upon
a
leaf
of
my
notebook
i
asked
weymouth
to
send
the
man
who
accompanied
him
to
call
up
the
nearest
chemist
and
procure
the
antidote
during
the
man
absence
smith
stood
contemplating
the
unconscious
inventor
a
peculiar
expression
upon
his
bronzed
face
andaman
second
he
muttered
shall
we
find
the
key
to
the
riddle
here
i
wonder
inspector
weymouth
who
had
concluded
i
think
that
the
mysterious
telephone
call
was
due
to
mental
aberration
on
the
part
of
norris
west
was
gnawing
at
his
mustache
impatiently
when
his
assistant
returned
i
administered
the
powerful
restorative
and
although
as
later
transpired
chloral
was
not
responsible
for
west
condition
the
antidote
operated
successfully
norris
west
struggled
into
a
sitting
position
and
looked
about
him
with
haggard
eyes
the
chinamen
the
chinamen
he
muttered
he
sprang
to
his
feet
glaring
wildly
at
smith
and
me
reeled
and
almost
fell
it
is
all
right
i
said
supporting
him
i
a
doctor
you
have
been
unwell
have
the
police
come
he
burst
out
the
safe
try
the
safe
it
all
right
said
inspector
weymouth
the
safe
is
locked
unless
someone
else
knows
the
combination
there
nothing
to
worry
about
no
one
else
knows
it
said
west
and
staggered
unsteadily
to
the
safe
clearly
his
mind
was
in
a
dazed
condition
but
setting
his
jaw
with
a
curious
expression
of
grim
determination
he
collected
his
thoughts
and
opened
the
safe
he
bent
down
looking
in
in
some
way
the
knowledge
came
to
me
that
the
curtain
was
about
to
rise
on
a
new
and
surprising
act
in
the
drama
god
he
whispered
we
could
scarcely
hear
him
the
plans
are
gone
chapter
xix
i
have
never
seen
a
man
quite
so
surprised
as
inspector
weymouth
this
is
absolutely
incredible
he
said
there
only
one
door
to
your
chambers
we
found
it
bolted
from
the
inside
yes
groaned
west
pressing
his
hand
to
his
forehead
i
bolted
it
myself
at
eleven
when
i
came
in
no
human
being
could
climb
up
or
down
to
your
windows
the
plans
of
the
were
inside
a
safe
i
put
them
there
myself
said
west
on
returning
from
the
war
office
and
i
had
occasion
to
consult
them
after
i
had
come
in
and
bolted
the
door
i
returned
them
to
the
safe
and
locked
it
that
it
was
still
locked
you
saw
for
yourselves
and
no
one
else
in
the
world
knows
the
combination
but
the
plans
have
gone
said
weymouth
it
magic
how
was
it
done
what
happened
last
night
sir
what
did
you
mean
when
you
rang
us
up
smith
during
this
colloquy
was
pacing
rapidly
up
and
down
the
room
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
aviator
every
fact
you
can
remember
west
please
he
said
tersely
and
be
as
brief
as
you
possibly
can
i
came
in
as
i
said
explained
west
about
eleven
and
having
made
some
notes
relating
to
an
interview
arranged
for
this
morning
i
locked
the
plans
in
the
safe
and
turned
in
there
was
no
one
hidden
anywhere
in
your
chambers
snapped
smith
there
was
not
replied
west
i
looked
i
invariably
do
almost
immediately
i
went
to
sleep
how
many
chloral
tabloids
did
you
take
i
interrupted
norris
west
turned
to
me
with
a
slow
smile
you
cute
doctor
he
said
i
took
two
it
a
bad
habit
but
i
ca
sleep
without
they
are
specially
made
up
for
me
by
a
firm
in
philadelphia
how
long
sleep
lasted
when
it
became
filled
with
uncanny
dreams
and
when
those
dreams
merged
into
reality
i
do
not
know
shall
never
know
i
suppose
but
out
of
the
dreamless
void
a
face
came
to
me
closer
closer
and
peered
into
mine
i
was
in
that
curious
condition
wherein
one
knows
that
one
is
dreaming
and
seeks
to
awaken
to
escape
but
a
oppression
held
me
so
i
must
lie
and
gaze
into
the
seared
yellow
face
that
hung
over
me
for
it
would
drop
so
close
that
i
could
trace
the
cicatrized
scar
running
from
the
left
ear
to
the
corner
of
the
mouth
and
drawing
up
the
lip
like
the
lip
of
a
snarling
cur
i
could
look
into
the
malignant
jaundiced
eyes
i
could
hear
the
dim
whispering
of
the
distorted
mouth
whispering
that
seemed
to
counsel
something
something
evil
that
whispering
intimacy
was
indescribably
repulsive
then
the
wicked
yellow
face
would
be
withdrawn
and
would
recede
until
it
became
as
a
pin
head
in
the
darkness
far
above
me
almost
like
a
glutinous
liquid
thing
somehow
i
got
upon
my
feet
or
dreamed
i
did
god
knows
where
dreaming
ended
and
reality
began
gentlemen
maybe
you
conclude
i
went
mad
last
night
but
as
i
stood
holding
on
to
the
bedrail
i
heard
the
blood
throbbing
through
my
arteries
with
a
noise
like
a
i
started
laughing
the
laughter
issued
from
my
lips
with
a
shrill
whistling
sound
that
pierced
me
with
physical
pain
and
seemed
to
wake
the
echoes
of
the
whole
block
i
thought
myself
i
was
going
mad
and
i
tried
to
command
my
will
to
break
the
power
of
the
chloral
for
i
concluded
that
i
had
accidentally
taken
an
overdose
then
the
walls
of
my
bedroom
started
to
recede
till
at
last
i
stood
holding
on
to
a
bed
which
had
shrunk
to
the
size
of
a
doll
cot
in
the
middle
of
a
room
like
trafalgar
square
that
window
yonder
was
such
a
long
way
off
i
could
scarcely
see
it
but
i
could
just
detect
a
chinaman
the
owner
of
the
evil
yellow
face
creeping
through
it
he
was
followed
by
another
who
was
enormously
tall
so
tall
that
as
they
came
towards
me
and
it
seemed
to
take
them
something
like
to
cross
this
incredible
apartment
in
my
dream
the
second
chinaman
seemed
to
tower
over
me
like
a
i
looked
up
to
his
face
his
wicked
hairless
face
smith
whatever
age
i
live
to
i
never
forget
that
face
i
saw
last
night
or
did
i
see
it
god
knows
the
pointed
chin
the
great
dome
of
a
forehead
and
the
eyes
heavens
above
the
huge
green
eyes
he
shook
like
a
sick
man
and
i
glanced
at
smith
significantly
inspector
weymouth
was
stroking
his
mustache
and
his
mingled
expression
of
incredulity
and
curiosity
was
singular
to
behold
the
pumping
of
my
blood
continued
west
seemed
to
be
bursting
my
body
the
room
kept
expanding
and
contracting
one
time
the
ceiling
would
be
pressing
down
on
my
head
and
the
chinamen
sometimes
i
thought
there
were
two
of
them
sometimes
twenty
became
dwarfs
the
next
instant
it
shot
up
like
the
roof
of
a
cathedral
i
be
awake
i
whispered
am
i
dreaming
my
whisper
went
sweeping
in
windy
echoes
about
the
walls
and
was
lost
in
the
shadowy
distances
up
under
the
invisible
roof
are
dreaming
yes
it
was
the
chinaman
with
the
green
eyes
who
was
addressing
me
and
the
words
that
he
uttered
appeared
to
occupy
an
immeasurable
time
in
the
utterance
at
will
i
can
render
the
subjective
objective
i
do
think
i
can
have
dreamed
those
singular
words
gentlemen
and
then
he
fixed
the
green
eyes
upon
me
the
blazing
green
eyes
i
made
no
attempt
to
move
they
seemed
to
be
draining
me
of
something
vital
bleeding
me
of
every
drop
of
mental
power
the
whole
nightmare
room
grew
green
and
i
felt
that
i
was
being
absorbed
into
its
greenness
i
can
see
what
you
think
and
even
in
my
delirium
if
it
was
delirium
i
thought
the
same
now
comes
the
climax
of
my
experience
my
vision
i
do
know
what
to
call
it
i
saw
some
words
issuing
from
my
own
mouth
inspector
weymouth
coughed
discreetly
smith
whisked
round
upon
him
this
will
be
outside
your
experience
inspector
i
know
he
said
but
norris
west
statement
does
not
surprise
me
in
the
least
i
know
to
what
the
experience
was
due
weymouth
stared
incredulously
but
a
dawning
perception
of
the
truth
was
come
to
me
too
how
i
saw
a
sound
i
just
wo
attempt
to
explain
i
simply
tell
you
i
saw
it
somehow
i
knew
i
had
betrayed
myself
given
something
away
you
gave
away
the
secret
of
the
lock
combination
rapped
smith
eh
grunted
weymouth
but
west
went
on
hoarsely
just
before
the
blank
came
a
name
flashed
before
my
eyes
it
was
taylor
at
that
i
interrupted
west
i
understand
i
cried
i
understand
another
name
has
just
occurred
to
me
west
that
of
the
frenchman
moreau
you
have
solved
the
mystery
said
smith
it
was
natural
west
should
have
thought
of
the
american
traveler
bayard
taylor
though
moreau
book
is
purely
scientific
he
has
probably
never
read
it
i
fought
with
the
stupor
that
was
overcoming
me
continued
west
striving
to
associate
that
vaguely
familiar
name
with
the
fantastic
things
through
which
i
moved
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
room
was
empty
again
i
made
for
the
hall
for
the
telephone
i
could
scarcely
drag
my
feet
along
it
seemed
to
take
me
to
get
there
i
remember
calling
up
scotland
yard
and
i
remember
no
more
there
was
a
short
tense
interval
in
some
respects
i
was
nonplused
but
frankly
i
think
inspector
weymouth
considered
west
insane
smith
his
hands
locked
behind
his
back
stared
out
of
the
window
andaman
second
he
said
suddenly
weymouth
when
is
the
first
train
to
tilbury
five
from
fenchurch
street
replied
the
scotland
yard
man
promptly
too
late
rapped
my
friend
jump
in
a
taxi
and
pick
up
two
good
men
to
leave
for
china
at
once
then
go
and
charter
a
special
to
tilbury
to
leave
in
minutes
order
another
cab
to
wait
outside
for
me
weymouth
was
palpably
amazed
but
smith
tone
was
imperative
the
inspector
departed
hastily
i
stared
at
smith
not
comprehending
what
prompted
this
singular
course
now
that
you
can
think
clearly
west
he
said
of
what
does
your
experience
remind
you
the
errors
of
perception
regarding
time
the
idea
of
seeing
a
sound
the
illusion
that
the
room
alternately
increased
and
diminished
in
size
your
fit
of
laughter
and
the
recollection
of
the
name
bayard
taylor
since
evidently
you
are
familiar
with
that
author
work
land
of
the
saracen
is
it
not
these
symptoms
of
the
attack
should
be
familiar
i
think
norris
west
pressed
his
hands
to
his
evidently
aching
head
bayard
taylor
book
he
said
dully
yes
i
know
of
what
my
brain
sought
to
remind
me
taylor
account
of
his
experience
under
hashish
smith
someone
doped
me
with
hashish
smith
nodded
grimly
cannabis
indica
i
said
indian
hemp
that
is
what
you
were
drugged
with
i
have
no
doubt
that
now
you
experience
a
feeling
of
nausea
and
intense
thirst
with
aching
in
the
muscles
particularly
the
deltoid
i
think
you
must
have
taken
at
least
fifteen
grains
smith
stopped
his
perambulations
immediately
in
front
of
west
looking
into
his
dulled
eyes
someone
visited
your
chambers
last
night
he
said
slowly
and
for
your
chloral
tabloids
substituted
some
containing
hashish
or
perhaps
not
pure
hashish
is
a
profound
chemist
norris
west
started
someone
substituted
he
began
exactly
said
smith
looking
at
him
keenly
someone
who
was
here
yesterday
have
you
any
idea
whom
it
could
have
been
west
hesitated
i
had
a
visitor
in
the
afternoon
he
said
seemingly
speaking
the
words
unwillingly
but
a
lady
jerked
smith
i
suggest
that
it
was
a
lady
west
nodded
you
quite
right
he
admitted
i
do
know
how
you
arrived
at
the
conclusion
but
a
lady
whose
acquaintance
i
made
recently
a
foreign
lady
karamaneh
snapped
smith
i
do
know
what
you
mean
in
the
least
but
she
came
here
knowing
this
to
be
my
present
address
to
ask
me
to
protect
her
from
a
mysterious
man
who
had
followed
her
right
from
charing
cross
she
said
he
was
down
in
the
lobby
and
naturally
i
asked
her
to
wait
here
whilst
i
went
and
sent
him
about
his
business
he
laughed
shortly
i
am
he
said
to
be
guyed
by
a
woman
you
spoke
just
now
of
someone
called
is
that
the
crook
i
indebted
to
for
the
loss
of
my
plans
i
had
attempts
made
by
agents
of
two
european
governments
but
a
chinaman
is
a
novelty
this
chinaman
smith
assured
him
is
the
greatest
novelty
of
his
age
you
recognize
your
symptoms
now
from
bayard
taylor
account
west
statement
i
said
ran
closely
parallel
with
portions
of
moreau
book
on
hallucinations
only
i
think
would
have
thought
of
employing
indian
hemp
i
doubt
though
if
it
was
pure
cannabis
indica
at
any
rate
it
acted
as
an
opiate
and
drugged
west
interrupted
smith
sufficiently
to
enable
to
enter
unobserved
whilst
it
produced
symptoms
which
rendered
him
an
easy
subject
for
the
doctor
influence
it
is
difficult
in
this
case
to
separate
hallucination
from
reality
but
i
think
west
that
must
have
exercised
an
hypnotic
influence
upon
your
drugged
brain
we
have
evidence
that
he
dragged
from
you
the
secret
of
the
combination
god
knows
we
have
said
west
but
who
is
this
and
how
how
in
the
name
of
wonder
did
he
get
into
my
chambers
smith
pulled
out
his
watch
that
he
said
rapidly
i
can
not
delay
to
explain
if
i
to
intercept
the
man
who
has
the
plans
come
along
petrie
we
must
be
at
tilbury
within
the
hour
there
is
just
a
bare
chance
chapter
xx
it
was
with
my
mind
in
a
condition
of
unique
perplexity
that
i
hurried
with
nayland
smith
into
the
cab
which
waited
and
dashed
off
through
the
streets
in
which
the
busy
life
of
london
just
stirred
into
being
i
suppose
i
need
not
say
that
i
could
penetrate
no
farther
into
this
latest
plot
than
the
drugging
of
norris
west
with
hashish
of
his
having
been
so
drugged
with
indian
hemp
that
is
converted
temporarily
into
a
maniac
would
have
been
evident
to
any
medical
man
who
had
heard
his
statement
and
noted
the
distressing
which
conclusively
pointed
to
indian
hemp
poisoning
knowing
something
of
the
chinese
doctor
powers
i
could
understand
that
he
might
have
extracted
from
west
the
secret
of
the
combination
by
sheer
force
of
will
whilst
the
american
was
under
the
influence
of
the
drug
but
i
could
not
understand
how
had
gained
access
to
locked
chambers
on
the
third
story
of
a
building
smith
i
said
those
bird
tracks
on
the
they
furnish
the
key
to
a
mystery
which
is
puzzling
me
they
do
said
smith
glancing
impatiently
at
his
watch
consult
your
memories
of
habits
especially
your
memories
of
his
pets
i
reviewed
in
my
mind
the
creatures
gruesome
and
terrible
which
surrounded
the
chinaman
the
scorpions
the
bacteria
the
noxious
things
which
were
the
weapons
wherewith
he
visited
death
upon
whomsoever
opposed
the
establishment
of
a
potential
yellow
empire
but
no
one
of
them
could
account
for
the
imprints
upon
the
dust
of
you
puzzle
me
smith
i
confessed
there
is
much
in
this
extraordinary
case
that
puzzles
me
i
can
think
of
nothing
to
account
for
the
marks
have
you
thought
of
marmoset
asked
smith
the
monkey
i
cried
they
were
the
footprints
of
a
small
ape
my
friend
continued
for
a
moment
i
was
deceived
as
you
were
and
believed
them
to
be
the
tracks
of
a
large
bird
but
i
have
seen
the
footprints
of
apes
before
now
and
a
marmoset
though
an
american
variety
i
believe
is
not
unlike
some
of
the
apes
of
burma
i
am
still
in
the
dark
i
said
it
is
pure
hypothesis
continued
smith
but
here
is
the
theory
in
lieu
of
a
better
one
it
covers
the
facts
the
marmoset
and
it
is
contrary
from
the
character
of
to
keep
any
creature
for
mere
amusement
is
trained
to
perform
certain
duties
you
observed
the
waterspout
running
up
beside
the
window
you
observed
the
iron
bar
intended
to
prevent
a
from
falling
out
for
an
ape
the
climb
from
the
court
below
to
the
sill
above
was
a
simple
one
he
carried
a
cord
probably
attached
to
his
body
he
climbed
on
to
the
sill
over
the
bar
and
climbed
down
again
by
means
of
this
cord
a
rope
was
pulled
up
over
the
bar
by
means
of
the
rope
one
of
those
ladders
of
silk
and
bamboo
one
of
the
doctor
servants
ascended
probably
to
ascertain
if
the
hashish
had
acted
successfully
that
was
the
yellow
which
west
saw
bending
over
him
then
followed
the
doctor
and
to
his
giant
will
the
drugged
brain
of
west
was
a
pliant
instrument
which
he
bent
to
his
own
ends
the
court
would
be
deserted
at
that
hour
of
the
night
and
in
any
event
directly
after
the
ascent
the
ladder
probably
was
pulled
up
only
to
be
lowered
again
when
west
had
revealed
the
secret
of
his
own
safe
and
had
secured
the
plans
the
reclosing
of
the
safe
and
the
removing
of
the
hashish
tabloids
leaving
no
clew
beyond
the
delirious
ravings
of
a
drug
slave
for
so
anyone
unacquainted
with
the
east
must
have
construed
west
story
is
particularly
characteristic
his
own
tabloids
were
returned
of
course
the
sparing
of
his
life
alone
is
a
refinement
of
art
which
points
to
a
past
master
karamaneh
was
the
decoy
again
i
said
shortly
certainly
hers
was
the
task
to
ascertain
west
habits
and
to
substitute
the
tabloids
she
it
was
who
waited
in
the
luxurious
car
infinitely
less
likely
to
attract
attention
at
that
hour
in
that
place
than
a
modest
taxi
and
received
the
stolen
plans
she
did
her
work
well
poor
karamaneh
she
had
no
alternative
i
said
i
would
have
given
a
hundred
pounds
for
a
sight
of
the
messenger
face
the
man
to
whom
she
handed
them
i
would
give
a
thousand
now
andaman
second
i
said
what
did
she
mean
then
it
has
not
dawned
upon
you
cried
smith
excitedly
as
the
cab
turned
into
the
station
the
andaman
of
the
oriental
navigation
company
line
leaves
tilbury
with
the
next
tide
for
china
ports
our
man
is
a
passenger
i
am
wiring
to
delay
her
departure
and
the
special
should
get
us
to
the
docks
inside
of
forty
minutes
very
vividly
i
can
reconstruct
in
my
mind
that
dash
to
the
docks
through
the
early
autumn
morning
my
friend
being
invested
with
extraordinary
powers
from
the
highest
authorities
by
inspector
weymouth
instructions
the
line
had
been
cleared
all
the
way
something
of
the
tremendous
importance
of
nayland
smith
mission
came
home
to
me
as
we
hurried
on
to
the
platform
escorted
by
the
and
the
five
of
us
for
weymouth
had
two
other
men
with
him
took
our
seats
in
the
special
off
we
went
on
top
speed
roaring
through
stations
where
a
glimpse
might
be
had
of
wondering
officials
upon
the
platforms
for
a
special
train
was
a
novelty
on
the
line
all
ordinary
traffic
arrangements
were
held
up
until
we
had
passed
through
and
we
reached
tilbury
in
time
which
i
doubt
not
constituted
a
record
there
at
the
docks
was
the
great
liner
delayed
in
her
passage
to
the
far
east
by
the
will
of
my
royally
empowered
companion
it
was
novel
and
infinitely
exciting
commissioner
nayland
smith
said
the
captain
interrogatively
when
we
were
shown
into
his
room
and
looked
from
one
to
another
and
back
to
the
telegraph
form
which
he
held
in
his
hand
the
same
captain
said
my
friend
briskly
i
shall
not
detain
you
a
moment
i
am
instructing
the
authorities
at
all
ports
east
of
suez
to
apprehend
one
of
your
passengers
should
he
leave
the
ship
he
is
in
possession
of
plans
which
practically
belong
to
the
british
government
why
not
arrest
him
now
asked
the
seaman
bluntly
because
i
do
know
him
all
passengers
baggage
will
be
searched
as
they
land
i
am
hoping
something
from
that
if
all
else
fails
but
i
want
you
privately
to
instruct
your
stewards
to
watch
any
passenger
of
oriental
nationality
and
to
cooperate
with
the
two
scotland
yard
men
who
are
joining
you
for
the
voyage
i
look
to
you
to
recover
these
plans
captain
i
will
do
my
best
the
captain
assured
him
then
from
amid
the
heterogeneous
group
on
the
dockside
we
were
watching
the
liner
depart
and
nayland
smith
expression
was
a
very
singular
one
inspector
weymouth
stood
with
us
a
badly
puzzled
man
then
occurred
the
extraordinary
incident
which
to
this
day
remains
inexplicable
for
clearly
heard
by
all
three
of
us
a
guttural
voice
said
another
victory
for
china
nayland
smith
i
turned
as
though
i
had
been
stung
smith
turned
also
my
eyes
passed
from
face
to
face
of
the
group
about
us
none
was
familiar
no
one
apparently
had
moved
away
but
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
doctor
as
i
write
of
it
now
i
can
appreciate
the
difference
between
that
happening
as
it
appealed
to
us
and
as
it
must
appeal
to
you
who
merely
read
of
it
it
is
beyond
my
powers
to
convey
the
sense
of
the
uncanny
which
the
episode
created
yet
even
as
i
think
of
it
i
feel
again
though
in
lesser
degree
the
chill
which
seemed
to
creep
through
my
veins
that
day
from
my
brief
history
of
the
wonderful
and
evil
man
who
once
walked
by
the
way
unsuspected
in
the
midst
of
the
people
of
england
near
whom
you
personally
may
at
some
time
unwittingly
have
been
i
am
aware
that
much
must
be
omitted
i
have
no
space
for
lengthy
examinations
of
the
many
points
but
ill
illuminated
with
which
it
is
dotted
this
incident
at
the
docks
is
but
one
such
point
another
is
the
singular
vision
which
appeared
to
me
whilst
i
lay
in
the
cellar
of
the
house
near
windsor
it
has
since
struck
me
that
it
possessed
peculiarities
akin
to
those
of
a
hashish
hallucination
can
it
be
that
we
were
drugged
on
that
occasion
with
indian
hemp
cannabis
indica
is
a
treacherous
narcotic
as
every
medical
man
knows
full
well
but
knowledge
of
the
drug
was
far
in
advance
of
our
slow
science
west
experience
proved
so
much
i
may
have
neglected
opportunities
later
you
shall
judge
if
i
did
so
opportunities
to
glean
for
the
west
some
of
the
strange
knowledge
of
the
secret
east
perhaps
at
a
future
time
i
may
rectify
my
errors
perhaps
that
wisdom
the
wisdom
stored
up
by
is
lost
forever
there
is
however
at
least
a
bare
possibility
of
its
survival
in
part
and
i
do
not
wholly
despair
of
one
day
publishing
a
scientific
sequel
to
this
record
of
our
dealings
with
the
chinese
doctor
chapter
xxi
time
wore
on
and
seemingly
brought
us
no
nearer
or
very
little
nearer
to
our
goal
so
carefully
had
my
friend
nayland
smith
excluded
the
matter
from
the
press
that
whilst
public
interest
was
much
engaged
with
some
of
the
events
in
the
skein
of
mystery
which
he
had
come
from
burma
to
unravel
outside
the
secret
service
and
the
special
department
of
scotland
yard
few
people
recognized
that
the
several
murders
robberies
and
disappearances
formed
each
a
link
in
a
chain
fewer
still
were
aware
that
a
baneful
presence
was
in
our
midst
that
a
past
master
of
the
evil
arts
lay
concealed
somewhere
in
the
metropolis
searched
for
by
the
keenest
wits
which
the
authorities
could
direct
to
the
task
but
eluding
all
triumphant
contemptuous
one
link
in
that
chain
smith
himself
for
long
failed
to
recognize
yet
it
was
a
big
and
important
link
petrie
he
said
to
me
one
morning
listen
to
this
in
sight
of
shanghai
a
clear
dark
night
on
board
the
deck
of
a
junk
passing
close
to
seaward
of
the
andaman
a
blue
flare
started
up
a
minute
later
there
was
a
cry
of
man
overboard
lewin
the
chief
officer
who
was
in
charge
stopped
the
engines
a
boat
was
put
out
but
no
one
was
recovered
there
are
sharks
in
these
waters
a
fairly
heavy
sea
was
running
showed
the
missing
man
to
be
a
james
edwards
second
class
booked
to
shanghai
i
think
the
name
was
assumed
the
man
was
some
sort
of
oriental
and
we
had
had
him
under
close
observation
that
the
end
of
their
report
exclaimed
smith
he
referred
to
the
two
men
who
had
joined
the
andaman
at
the
moment
of
her
departure
from
tilbury
he
carefully
lighted
his
pipe
is
it
a
victory
for
china
petrie
he
said
softly
until
the
great
war
reveals
her
secret
resources
and
i
pray
that
the
day
be
not
in
my
time
we
shall
never
know
i
replied
smith
began
striding
up
and
down
the
room
whose
name
he
jerked
abruptly
stands
now
at
the
head
of
our
danger
list
he
referred
to
a
list
which
we
had
compiled
of
the
notable
men
intervening
between
the
evil
genius
who
secretly
had
invaded
london
and
the
triumph
of
his
cause
the
triumph
of
the
yellow
races
i
glanced
at
our
notes
lord
southery
i
replied
smith
tossed
the
morning
paper
across
to
me
look
he
said
shortly
he
dead
i
read
the
account
of
the
peer
death
and
glanced
at
the
long
obituary
notice
but
no
more
than
glanced
at
it
he
had
but
recently
returned
from
the
east
and
now
after
a
short
illness
had
died
from
some
affection
of
the
heart
there
had
been
no
intimation
that
his
illness
was
of
a
serious
nature
and
even
smith
who
watched
over
his
flock
the
flock
threatened
by
the
wolf
with
jealous
zeal
had
not
suspected
that
the
end
was
so
near
do
you
think
he
died
a
natural
death
smith
i
asked
my
friend
reached
across
the
table
and
rested
the
tip
of
a
long
finger
upon
one
of
the
to
the
account
sir
frank
narcombe
summoned
too
late
you
see
said
smith
southery
died
during
the
night
but
sir
frank
narcombe
arriving
a
few
minutes
later
unhesitatingly
pronounced
death
to
be
due
to
syncope
and
seems
to
have
noticed
nothing
suspicious
i
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
sir
frank
is
a
great
physician
i
said
slowly
but
we
must
remember
he
would
be
looking
for
nothing
suspicious
we
must
remember
rapped
smith
that
if
is
responsible
for
southery
death
except
to
the
eye
of
an
expert
there
would
be
nothing
suspicious
to
see
leaves
no
clews
are
you
going
around
i
asked
smith
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
think
not
he
replied
either
a
greater
one
than
has
taken
lord
southery
or
the
yellow
doctor
has
done
his
work
so
well
that
no
trace
remains
of
his
presence
in
the
matter
leaving
his
breakfast
untasted
he
wandered
aimlessly
about
the
room
littering
the
hearth
with
matches
as
he
constantly
relighted
his
pipe
which
went
out
every
few
minutes
it
no
good
petrie
he
burst
out
suddenly
it
can
not
be
a
coincidence
we
must
go
around
and
see
him
an
hour
later
we
stood
in
the
silent
room
with
its
drawn
blinds
and
its
deathful
atmosphere
looking
down
at
the
pale
intellectual
face
of
henry
stradwick
lord
southery
the
greatest
engineer
of
his
day
the
mind
that
lay
behind
that
splendid
brow
had
planned
the
construction
of
the
railway
for
which
russia
had
paid
so
great
a
price
had
conceived
the
scheme
for
the
canal
which
in
the
near
future
was
to
bring
two
great
continents
a
full
week
journey
nearer
one
to
the
other
but
now
it
would
plan
no
more
he
had
latterly
developed
symptoms
of
angina
pectoris
explained
the
family
physician
but
i
had
not
anticipated
a
fatal
termination
so
soon
i
was
called
about
two
this
morning
and
found
lord
southery
in
a
dangerously
exhausted
condition
i
did
all
that
was
possible
and
sir
frank
narcombe
was
sent
for
but
shortly
before
his
arrival
the
patient
expired
i
understand
doctor
that
you
had
been
treating
lord
southery
for
angina
pectoris
i
said
yes
was
the
reply
for
some
months
you
regard
the
circumstances
of
his
end
as
entirely
consistent
with
a
death
from
that
cause
certainly
do
you
observe
anything
unusual
yourself
sir
frank
narcombe
quite
agrees
with
me
there
is
surely
no
room
for
doubt
no
said
smith
tugging
reflectively
at
the
lobe
of
his
left
ear
we
do
not
question
the
accuracy
of
your
diagnosis
in
any
way
sir
the
physician
seemed
puzzled
but
am
i
not
right
in
supposing
that
you
are
connected
with
the
police
asked
the
physician
neither
petrie
nor
myself
are
in
any
way
connected
with
the
police
answered
smith
but
nevertheless
i
look
to
you
to
regard
our
recent
questions
as
confidential
as
we
were
leaving
the
house
hushed
awesomely
in
deference
to
the
unseen
visitor
who
had
touched
lord
southery
with
gray
cold
fingers
smith
paused
detaining
a
man
who
passed
us
on
the
stairs
you
were
lord
southery
valet
the
man
bowed
were
you
in
the
room
at
the
moment
of
his
fatal
seizure
i
was
sir
did
you
see
or
hear
anything
unusual
anything
unaccountable
nothing
sir
no
strange
sounds
outside
the
house
for
instance
the
man
shook
his
head
and
smith
taking
my
arm
passed
out
into
the
street
perhaps
this
business
is
making
me
imaginative
he
said
but
there
seems
to
be
something
tainting
the
air
in
yonder
something
peculiar
to
houses
whose
doors
bear
the
invisible
of
you
are
right
smith
i
cried
i
hesitated
to
mention
the
matter
but
i
too
have
developed
some
other
sense
which
warns
me
of
the
doctor
presence
although
there
is
not
a
scrap
of
confirmatory
evidence
i
am
as
sure
that
he
has
brought
about
lord
southery
death
as
if
i
had
seen
him
strike
the
blow
it
was
in
that
torturing
frame
of
mind
chained
helpless
in
our
ignorance
or
by
reason
of
the
chinaman
supernormal
genius
that
we
lived
throughout
the
ensuing
days
my
friend
began
to
look
like
a
man
consumed
by
a
burning
fever
yet
we
could
not
act
in
the
growing
dark
of
an
evening
shortly
following
i
stood
idly
turning
over
some
of
the
works
exposed
for
sale
outside
a
bookseller
in
new
oxford
street
one
dealing
with
the
secret
societies
of
china
struck
me
as
being
likely
to
prove
instructive
and
i
was
about
to
call
the
shopman
when
i
was
startled
to
feel
a
hand
clutch
my
arm
i
turned
around
rapidly
and
was
looking
into
the
darkly
beautiful
eyes
of
karamaneh
she
whom
i
had
seen
in
so
many
guises
was
dressed
in
a
perfectly
fitting
walking
habit
and
had
much
of
her
wonderful
hair
concealed
beneath
a
fashionable
hat
she
glanced
about
her
apprehensively
quick
come
round
the
corner
i
must
speak
to
you
she
said
her
musical
voice
thrilling
with
excitement
i
never
was
quite
master
of
myself
in
her
presence
he
must
have
been
a
man
of
ice
who
could
have
been
i
think
for
her
beauty
had
all
the
bouquet
of
rarity
she
was
a
mystery
and
mystery
adds
charm
to
a
woman
probably
she
should
have
been
under
arrest
but
i
know
i
would
have
risked
much
to
save
her
from
it
as
we
turned
into
a
quiet
thoroughfare
she
stopped
and
said
i
am
in
distress
you
have
often
asked
me
to
enable
you
to
capture
i
am
prepared
to
do
so
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
i
heard
right
your
brother
i
began
she
seized
my
arm
entreatingly
looking
into
my
eyes
you
are
a
doctor
she
said
i
want
you
to
come
and
see
him
now
what
is
he
in
london
he
is
at
the
house
of
dr
and
you
would
have
me
accompany
me
there
yes
nayland
smith
i
doubted
not
would
have
counseled
me
against
trusting
my
life
in
the
hands
of
this
girl
with
the
pleading
eyes
yet
i
did
so
and
with
little
hesitation
shortly
we
were
traveling
eastward
in
a
closed
cab
karamaneh
was
very
silent
but
always
when
i
turned
to
her
i
found
her
big
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
an
expression
in
which
there
was
pleading
in
which
there
was
sorrow
in
which
there
was
something
else
something
indefinable
yet
strangely
disturbing
the
cabman
she
had
directed
to
drive
to
the
lower
end
of
the
commercial
road
the
neighborhood
of
the
new
docks
and
the
scene
of
one
of
our
early
adventures
with
the
mantle
of
dusk
had
closed
about
the
squalid
activity
of
the
east
end
streets
as
we
neared
our
destination
aliens
of
every
shade
of
color
were
about
us
now
emerging
from
alleys
into
the
glare
of
the
lamps
upon
the
main
road
in
the
short
space
of
the
drive
we
had
passed
from
the
bright
world
of
the
west
into
the
dubious
underworld
of
the
east
i
do
not
know
that
karamaneh
moved
but
in
sympathy
as
we
neared
the
abode
of
the
sinister
chinaman
she
crept
nearer
to
me
and
when
the
cab
was
discharged
and
together
we
walked
down
a
narrow
turning
leading
riverward
she
clung
to
me
fearfully
hesitated
and
even
seemed
upon
the
point
of
turning
back
but
overcoming
her
fear
or
repugnance
she
led
on
through
a
maze
of
alleyways
and
courts
wherein
i
hopelessly
lost
my
bearings
so
that
it
came
home
to
me
how
wholly
i
was
in
the
hands
of
this
girl
whose
history
was
so
full
of
shadows
whose
real
character
was
so
inscrutable
whose
beauty
whose
charm
truly
might
mask
the
cunning
of
a
serpent
i
spoke
to
her
she
laid
her
hand
upon
my
arm
enjoining
me
to
silence
the
high
drab
brick
wall
of
what
looked
like
some
part
of
a
dock
building
loomed
above
us
in
the
darkness
and
the
indescribable
stenches
of
the
lower
thames
were
borne
to
my
nostrils
through
a
gloomy
opening
beyond
which
whispered
the
river
the
muffled
clangor
of
waterside
activity
was
about
us
i
heard
a
key
grate
in
a
lock
and
karamaneh
drew
me
into
the
shadow
of
an
open
door
entered
and
closed
it
behind
her
for
the
first
time
i
perceived
in
contrast
to
the
odors
of
the
court
without
the
fragrance
of
the
peculiar
perfume
which
now
i
had
come
to
associate
with
her
absolute
darkness
was
about
us
and
by
this
perfume
alone
i
knew
that
she
was
near
to
me
until
her
hand
touched
mine
and
i
was
led
along
an
uncarpeted
passage
and
up
an
uncarpeted
stair
a
second
door
was
unlocked
and
i
found
myself
in
an
exquisitely
furnished
room
illuminated
by
the
soft
light
of
a
shaded
lamp
which
stood
upon
a
low
inlaid
table
amidst
a
perfect
ocean
of
silken
cushions
strewn
upon
a
persian
carpet
whose
yellow
richness
was
lost
in
the
shadows
beyond
the
circle
of
light
karamaneh
raised
a
curtain
draped
before
a
doorway
and
stood
listening
intently
for
a
moment
the
silence
was
unbroken
then
something
stirred
amid
the
wilderness
of
cushions
and
two
tiny
bright
eyes
looked
up
at
me
peering
closely
i
succeeded
in
distinguishing
crouched
in
that
soft
luxuriance
a
little
ape
it
was
marmoset
this
way
whispered
karamaneh
never
i
thought
was
a
staid
medical
man
committed
to
a
more
unwise
enterprise
but
so
far
i
had
gone
and
no
consideration
of
prudence
could
now
be
of
avail
the
corridor
beyond
was
thickly
carpeted
following
the
direction
of
a
faint
light
which
gleamed
ahead
it
proved
to
extend
as
a
balcony
across
one
end
of
a
spacious
apartment
together
we
stood
high
up
there
in
the
shadows
and
looked
down
upon
such
a
scene
as
i
never
could
have
imagined
to
exist
within
many
a
mile
of
that
district
the
place
below
was
even
more
richly
appointed
than
the
room
into
which
first
we
had
come
here
as
there
piles
of
cushions
formed
splashes
of
gaudy
color
about
the
floor
three
lamps
hung
by
chains
from
the
ceiling
their
light
softened
by
rich
silk
shades
one
wall
was
almost
entirely
occupied
by
glass
cases
containing
chemical
apparatus
tubes
retorts
and
other
less
orthodox
indications
of
pursuits
whilst
close
against
another
lay
the
most
extraordinary
object
of
a
sufficiently
extraordinary
room
a
low
couch
upon
which
was
extended
the
motionless
form
of
a
boy
in
the
light
of
a
lamp
which
hung
directly
above
him
his
olive
face
showed
an
almost
startling
resemblance
to
that
of
karamaneh
save
that
the
coloring
was
more
delicate
he
had
black
curly
hair
which
stood
out
prominently
against
the
white
covering
upon
which
he
lay
his
hands
crossed
upon
his
breast
transfixed
with
astonishment
i
stood
looking
down
upon
him
the
wonders
of
the
arabian
nights
were
wonders
no
longer
for
here
in
london
was
a
true
magician
palace
lacking
not
its
beautiful
slave
lacking
not
its
enchanted
prince
it
is
aziz
my
brother
said
karamaneh
we
passed
down
a
stairway
on
to
the
floor
of
the
apartment
karamaneh
knelt
and
bent
over
the
boy
stroking
his
hair
and
whispering
to
him
lovingly
i
too
bent
over
him
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
anxiety
in
the
girl
eyes
as
she
watched
me
eagerly
whilst
i
made
a
brief
examination
brief
indeed
for
even
ere
i
had
touched
him
i
knew
that
the
comely
shell
held
no
spark
of
life
but
karamaneh
fondled
the
cold
hands
and
spoke
softly
in
that
arabic
tongue
which
long
before
i
had
divined
must
be
her
native
language
then
as
i
remained
silent
she
turned
and
looked
at
me
read
the
truth
in
my
eyes
and
rose
from
her
knees
stood
rigidly
upright
and
clutched
me
tremblingly
he
is
not
dead
he
is
not
dead
she
whispered
and
shook
me
as
a
child
might
seeking
to
arouse
me
to
a
proper
understanding
oh
tell
me
he
is
not
i
can
not
i
replied
gently
for
indeed
he
is
no
she
said
and
raising
her
hands
to
her
face
as
though
half
distraught
you
do
not
understand
yet
you
are
a
doctor
you
do
not
understand
she
stopped
moaning
to
herself
and
looking
from
the
handsome
face
of
the
boy
to
me
it
was
pitiful
it
was
uncanny
but
sorrow
for
the
girl
predominated
in
my
mind
then
from
somewhere
i
heard
a
sound
which
i
had
heard
before
in
houses
occupied
by
that
of
a
muffled
gong
quick
karamaneh
had
me
by
the
arm
up
he
has
returned
she
fled
up
the
stairs
to
the
balcony
i
close
at
her
heels
the
shadows
veiled
us
the
thick
carpet
deadened
the
sound
of
our
tread
or
certainly
we
must
have
been
detected
by
the
man
who
entered
the
room
we
had
just
quitted
it
was
immobile
the
inhuman
green
eyes
glittering
catlike
even
it
seemed
before
the
light
struck
them
he
threaded
his
way
through
the
archipelago
of
cushions
and
bent
over
the
couch
of
aziz
karamaneh
dragged
me
down
on
to
my
knees
watch
she
whispered
watch
felt
for
the
pulse
of
the
boy
whom
a
moment
since
i
had
pronounced
dead
and
stepping
to
the
tall
glass
case
took
out
a
flask
of
chased
gold
and
from
it
into
a
graduated
glass
he
poured
some
drops
of
an
amber
liquid
wholly
unfamiliar
to
me
i
watched
him
with
all
my
eyes
and
noted
how
high
the
liquid
rose
in
the
measure
he
charged
a
and
bending
again
over
aziz
made
an
injection
then
all
the
wonders
i
had
heard
of
this
man
became
possible
and
with
an
awe
which
any
other
physician
who
had
examined
aziz
must
have
felt
i
admitted
him
a
for
as
i
watched
all
but
breathless
the
dead
came
to
life
the
glow
of
health
crept
upon
the
olive
cheek
the
boy
moved
he
raised
his
hands
above
his
head
he
sat
up
supported
by
the
chinese
doctor
touched
some
hidden
bell
a
hideous
yellow
man
with
a
scarred
face
entered
carrying
a
tray
upon
which
were
a
bowl
containing
some
steaming
fluid
apparently
soup
what
looked
like
oaten
cakes
and
a
flask
of
red
wine
as
the
boy
exhibiting
no
more
unusual
symptoms
than
if
he
had
just
awakened
from
a
normal
sleep
commenced
his
repast
karamaneh
drew
me
gently
along
the
passage
into
the
room
which
we
had
first
entered
my
heart
leaped
wildly
as
the
marmoset
bounded
past
us
to
drop
hand
over
hand
to
the
lower
apartment
in
search
of
its
master
you
see
said
karamaneh
her
voice
quivering
he
is
not
dead
but
without
he
is
dead
to
me
how
can
i
leave
him
when
he
holds
the
life
of
aziz
in
his
hand
you
must
get
me
that
flask
or
some
of
its
contents
i
directed
but
tell
me
how
does
he
produce
the
appearance
of
death
i
can
not
tell
you
she
replied
i
do
not
know
it
is
something
in
the
wine
in
another
hour
aziz
will
be
again
as
you
saw
him
but
see
and
opening
a
little
ebony
box
she
produced
a
phial
half
filled
with
the
amber
liquid
good
i
said
and
slipped
it
into
my
pocket
when
will
be
the
best
time
to
seize
and
to
restore
your
brother
i
will
let
you
know
she
whispered
and
opening
the
door
pushed
me
hurriedly
from
the
room
he
is
going
away
to
the
north
but
you
must
not
come
quick
quick
along
the
passage
he
may
call
me
at
any
moment
so
with
the
phial
in
my
pocket
containing
a
potent
preparation
unknown
to
western
science
and
with
a
last
long
look
into
the
eyes
of
karamaneh
i
passed
out
into
the
narrow
alley
out
from
the
fragrant
perfumes
of
that
mystery
house
into
the
place
of
stenches
chapter
xxii
we
must
arrange
for
the
house
to
be
raided
without
delay
said
smith
this
time
we
are
sure
of
our
ally
but
we
must
keep
our
promise
to
her
i
interrupted
you
can
look
after
that
petrie
my
friend
said
i
will
devote
the
whole
of
my
attention
to
dr
he
added
grimly
up
and
down
the
room
he
paced
gripping
the
blackened
briar
between
his
teeth
so
that
the
muscles
stood
out
squarely
upon
his
lean
jaws
the
bronze
which
spoke
of
the
burmese
sun
enhanced
the
brightness
of
his
gray
eyes
what
have
i
all
along
maintained
he
jerked
looking
back
at
me
across
his
shoulder
that
although
karamaneh
was
one
of
the
strongest
weapons
in
the
doctor
armory
she
was
one
which
some
day
would
be
turned
against
him
that
day
has
dawned
we
must
await
word
from
her
quite
so
he
knocked
out
his
pipe
on
the
grate
then
have
you
any
idea
of
the
nature
of
the
fluid
in
the
phial
not
the
slightest
and
i
have
none
to
spare
for
analytical
purposes
nayland
smith
began
stuffing
mixture
into
the
hot
and
dropping
an
almost
equal
quantity
on
the
floor
i
can
not
rest
petrie
he
said
i
am
itching
to
get
to
work
yet
a
false
move
and
he
lighted
his
pipe
and
stood
staring
from
the
window
i
shall
of
course
take
a
with
me
i
explained
smith
made
no
reply
if
i
but
knew
the
composition
of
the
drug
which
produced
the
semblance
of
death
i
continued
my
fame
would
long
survive
my
ashes
my
friend
did
not
turn
but
she
said
it
was
something
he
put
in
the
wine
he
jerked
in
the
wine
yes
silence
fell
my
thoughts
reverted
to
karamaneh
whom
held
in
bonds
stronger
than
any
for
with
aziz
her
brother
suspended
between
life
and
death
what
could
she
do
save
obey
the
mandates
of
the
cunning
chinaman
what
perverted
genius
was
his
if
that
treasury
of
obscure
wisdom
which
he
perhaps
alone
of
living
men
had
rifled
could
but
be
thrown
open
to
the
sick
and
suffering
the
name
of
would
rank
with
the
golden
ones
in
the
history
of
healing
nayland
smith
suddenly
turned
and
the
expression
upon
his
face
amazed
me
look
up
the
next
train
to
l
he
rapped
to
l
what
there
the
bradshaw
we
have
a
minute
to
waste
in
his
voice
was
the
imperative
note
i
knew
so
well
in
his
eyes
was
the
light
which
told
of
an
urgent
need
for
action
a
portentous
truth
suddenly
grasped
one
in
the
last
we
must
catch
it
no
further
word
of
explanation
he
vouchsafed
but
darted
off
to
dress
for
he
had
spent
the
afternoon
pacing
the
room
in
his
and
smoking
without
intermission
out
and
to
the
corner
we
hurried
and
leaped
into
the
first
taxi
upon
the
rank
smith
enjoined
the
man
to
hasten
and
we
were
off
all
in
that
whirl
of
feverish
activity
which
characterized
my
movements
in
times
of
important
action
he
sat
glancing
impatiently
from
the
window
and
twitching
at
the
lobe
of
his
ear
i
know
you
will
forgive
me
old
man
he
said
but
there
is
a
little
problem
which
i
am
trying
to
work
out
in
my
mind
did
you
bring
the
things
i
mentioned
yes
conversation
lapsed
until
just
as
the
cab
turned
into
the
station
smith
said
should
you
consider
lord
southery
to
have
been
the
first
constructive
engineer
of
his
time
petrie
undoubtedly
i
replied
greater
than
von
homber
of
berlin
possibly
not
but
von
homber
has
been
dead
for
three
years
three
years
is
it
roughly
ah
we
reached
the
station
in
time
to
secure
a
compartment
to
ourselves
and
to
allow
smith
leisure
carefully
to
inspect
the
occupants
of
all
the
others
from
the
engine
to
the
guard
van
he
was
muffled
up
to
the
eyes
and
he
warned
me
to
keep
out
of
sight
in
the
corner
of
the
compartment
in
fact
his
behavior
had
me
bursting
with
curiosity
the
train
having
started
do
imagine
petrie
said
smith
that
i
am
trying
to
lead
you
blindfolded
in
order
later
to
dazzle
you
with
my
perspicacity
i
am
simply
afraid
that
this
may
be
a
chase
the
idea
upon
which
i
am
acting
does
not
seem
to
have
struck
you
i
wish
it
had
the
fact
would
argue
in
favor
of
its
being
sound
at
present
i
am
hopelessly
mystified
well
then
i
will
not
bias
you
towards
my
view
but
just
study
the
situation
and
see
if
you
can
arrive
at
the
reason
for
this
sudden
journey
i
shall
be
distinctly
encouraged
if
you
succeed
but
i
did
not
succeed
and
since
smith
obviously
was
unwilling
to
enlighten
me
i
pressed
him
no
more
the
train
stopped
at
rugby
where
he
was
engaged
with
the
stationmaster
in
making
some
mysterious
arrangements
at
l
however
their
object
became
plain
for
a
car
was
awaiting
us
and
into
this
we
hurried
and
ere
the
greater
number
of
passengers
had
reached
the
platform
were
being
driven
off
at
headlong
speed
along
the
roads
twenty
minutes
rapid
traveling
and
a
white
mansion
leaped
into
the
line
of
sight
standing
out
vividly
against
its
woody
backing
stradwick
hall
said
smith
the
home
of
lord
southery
we
are
first
but
was
on
the
train
then
the
truth
dawned
upon
the
gloom
of
my
perplexity
chapter
xxiii
your
extraordinary
proposal
fills
me
with
horror
mr
smith
the
sleek
little
man
in
the
dress
suit
who
looked
like
a
head
waiter
but
was
the
trusted
legal
adviser
of
the
house
of
southery
puffed
at
his
cigar
indignantly
nayland
smith
whose
restless
pacing
had
led
him
to
the
far
end
of
the
library
turned
a
remote
but
virile
figure
and
looked
back
to
where
i
stood
by
the
open
hearth
with
the
solicitor
i
am
in
your
hands
henderson
he
said
and
advanced
upon
the
latter
his
gray
eyes
ablaze
save
for
the
heir
who
is
abroad
on
foreign
service
you
say
there
is
no
kin
of
lord
southery
to
consider
the
word
rests
with
you
if
i
am
wrong
and
you
agree
to
my
proposal
there
is
none
whose
susceptibilities
will
suffer
my
own
sir
if
i
am
right
and
you
prevent
me
from
acting
you
become
a
murderer
mr
henderson
the
lawyer
started
staring
nervously
up
at
smith
who
now
towered
over
him
menacingly
lord
southery
was
a
lonely
man
continued
my
friend
if
i
could
have
placed
my
proposition
before
one
of
his
blood
i
do
not
doubt
what
my
answer
had
been
why
do
you
hesitate
why
do
you
experience
this
feeling
of
horror
henderson
stared
down
into
the
fire
his
constitutionally
ruddy
face
was
pale
it
is
entirely
irregular
smith
we
have
not
the
necessary
powers
smith
snapped
his
teeth
together
impatiently
snatching
his
watch
from
his
pocket
and
glancing
at
it
i
am
vested
with
the
necessary
powers
i
will
give
you
a
written
order
sir
the
proceeding
savors
of
paganism
such
a
course
might
be
admissible
in
china
in
burma
do
you
weigh
a
life
against
such
quibbles
do
you
suppose
that
granting
my
irresponsibility
petrie
would
countenance
such
a
thing
if
he
doubted
the
necessity
henderson
looked
at
me
with
pathetic
hesitance
there
are
guests
in
the
house
mourners
who
attended
the
ceremony
they
will
never
know
if
we
are
in
error
interrupted
smith
good
god
why
do
you
delay
you
wish
it
to
be
kept
secret
you
and
i
henderson
and
petrie
will
go
now
we
require
no
other
witnesses
we
are
answerable
only
to
our
consciences
the
lawyer
passed
his
hand
across
his
damp
brow
i
have
never
in
my
life
been
called
upon
to
come
to
so
momentous
a
decision
in
so
short
a
time
he
confessed
but
aided
by
indomitable
will
he
made
his
decision
as
its
result
we
three
looking
and
feeling
like
conspirators
hurried
across
the
park
beneath
a
moon
whose
placidity
was
a
rebuke
to
the
turbulent
passions
which
reared
their
in
the
garden
of
england
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirred
amid
the
leaves
the
calm
of
perfect
night
soothed
everything
to
slumber
yet
if
smith
were
right
and
i
did
not
doubt
him
the
green
eyes
of
had
looked
upon
the
scene
and
i
found
myself
marveling
that
its
beauty
had
not
wilted
up
even
now
the
dread
chinaman
must
be
near
to
us
as
henderson
unlocked
the
ancient
iron
gates
he
turned
to
nayland
smith
his
face
twitched
oddly
witness
that
i
do
this
unwillingly
he
said
most
unwillingly
mine
be
the
responsibility
was
the
reply
smith
voice
quivered
responsive
to
the
nervous
vitality
pent
up
within
that
lean
frame
he
stood
motionless
listening
and
i
knew
for
whom
he
listened
he
peered
about
him
to
right
and
left
and
i
knew
whom
he
expected
but
dreaded
to
see
above
us
now
the
trees
looked
down
with
a
solemnity
different
from
the
aspect
of
the
monarchs
of
the
park
and
the
nearer
we
came
to
our
journey
end
the
more
somber
and
lowering
bent
the
verdant
arch
or
so
it
seemed
by
that
path
patched
now
with
pools
of
moonlight
lord
southery
had
passed
upon
his
bier
with
the
sun
to
light
his
going
by
that
path
several
generations
of
stradwicks
had
gone
to
their
last
to
the
doors
of
the
vault
the
moon
rays
found
free
access
no
branch
no
leaf
intervened
henderson
face
looked
ghastly
the
keys
which
he
carried
rattled
in
his
hand
light
the
lantern
he
said
unsteadily
nayland
smith
who
again
had
been
peering
suspiciously
about
into
the
shadows
struck
a
match
and
lighted
the
lantern
which
he
carried
he
turned
to
the
solicitor
be
calm
henderson
he
said
sternly
it
is
your
plain
duty
to
your
client
god
be
my
witness
that
i
doubt
it
replied
henderson
and
opened
the
door
we
descended
the
steps
the
air
beneath
was
damp
and
chill
it
touched
us
as
with
clammy
fingers
and
the
sensation
was
not
wholly
physical
before
the
narrow
mansion
which
now
sufficed
lord
southery
the
great
engineer
whom
kings
had
honored
henderson
reeled
and
clutched
at
me
for
support
smith
and
i
had
looked
to
him
for
no
aid
in
our
uncanny
task
and
rightly
with
averted
eyes
he
stood
over
by
the
steps
of
the
tomb
whilst
my
friend
and
myself
set
to
work
in
the
pursuit
of
my
profession
i
had
undertaken
labors
as
unpleasant
but
never
amid
an
environment
such
as
this
it
seemed
that
generations
of
stradwicks
listened
to
each
turn
of
every
screw
at
last
it
was
done
and
the
pallid
face
of
lord
southery
questioned
the
intruding
light
nayland
smith
hand
was
as
steady
as
a
rigid
bar
when
he
raised
the
lantern
later
i
knew
there
would
be
a
sudden
releasing
of
the
tension
of
will
a
reaction
physical
and
mental
but
not
until
his
work
was
finished
that
my
own
hand
was
steady
i
ascribed
to
one
thing
solely
professional
zeal
for
under
conditions
which
in
the
event
of
failure
and
exposure
must
have
led
to
an
unpleasant
inquiry
by
the
british
medical
association
i
was
about
to
attempt
an
experiment
never
before
essayed
by
a
physician
of
the
white
races
though
i
failed
though
i
succeeded
that
it
ever
came
before
the
or
any
other
council
was
improbable
in
the
former
event
all
but
impossible
but
the
knowledge
that
i
was
about
to
practice
charlatanry
or
what
any
one
of
my
must
have
designated
as
such
was
with
me
yet
so
profound
had
my
belief
become
in
the
extraordinary
being
whose
existence
was
a
danger
to
the
world
that
i
reveled
in
my
immunity
from
official
censure
i
was
glad
that
it
had
fallen
to
my
lot
to
take
at
least
one
step
though
blindly
into
the
future
of
medical
science
so
far
as
my
skill
bore
me
lord
southery
was
dead
unhesitatingly
i
would
have
given
a
death
certificate
save
for
two
considerations
the
first
although
his
latest
scheme
ran
contrary
from
the
interests
of
his
genius
diverted
into
other
channels
would
serve
the
yellow
group
better
than
his
death
the
second
i
had
seen
the
boy
aziz
raised
from
a
state
as
like
death
as
this
from
the
phial
of
liquid
which
i
had
with
me
i
charged
the
needle
syringe
i
made
the
injection
and
waited
if
he
is
really
dead
whispered
smith
it
seems
incredible
that
he
can
have
survived
for
three
days
without
food
yet
i
have
known
a
fakir
to
go
for
a
week
henderson
groaned
watch
in
hand
i
stood
observing
the
gray
face
a
second
passed
another
a
third
in
the
fourth
the
miracle
began
over
the
seemingly
cold
clay
crept
the
hue
of
pulsing
life
it
came
in
waves
in
waves
which
corresponded
with
the
throbbing
of
the
awakened
heart
which
swept
fuller
and
stronger
which
filled
and
quickened
the
chilled
body
as
we
rapidly
freed
the
living
man
from
the
trappings
of
the
dead
one
southery
uttering
a
stifled
scream
sat
up
looked
about
him
with
eyes
and
fell
back
my
god
cried
smith
it
is
all
right
i
said
and
had
time
to
note
how
my
voice
had
assumed
a
professional
tone
a
little
brandy
from
my
flask
is
all
that
is
necessary
now
you
have
two
patients
doctor
rapped
my
friend
henderson
had
fallen
in
a
swoon
to
the
floor
of
the
vault
quiet
whispered
smith
he
is
here
he
extinguished
the
light
i
supported
lord
southery
what
has
happened
he
kept
moaning
where
am
i
oh
god
what
has
happened
i
strove
to
reassure
him
in
a
whisper
and
placed
my
traveling
coat
about
him
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
mausoleum
steps
we
had
reclosed
but
not
relocked
now
as
i
upheld
the
man
whom
literally
we
had
rescued
from
the
grave
i
heard
the
door
reopen
to
aid
henderson
i
could
make
no
move
smith
was
breathing
hard
beside
me
i
dared
not
think
what
was
about
to
happen
nor
what
its
effects
might
be
upon
lord
southery
in
his
exhausted
condition
through
the
memphian
dark
of
the
tomb
cut
a
spear
of
light
touching
the
last
stone
of
the
stairway
a
guttural
voice
spoke
some
words
rapidly
and
i
knew
that
stood
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
although
i
could
not
see
my
friend
i
became
aware
that
nayland
smith
had
his
revolver
in
his
hand
and
i
reached
into
my
pocket
for
mine
at
last
the
cunning
chinaman
was
about
to
fall
into
a
trap
it
would
require
all
his
genius
i
thought
to
save
him
unless
his
suspicions
were
aroused
by
the
unlocked
door
his
capture
was
imminent
someone
was
descending
the
steps
in
my
right
hand
i
held
my
revolver
and
with
my
left
arm
about
lord
southery
i
waited
through
ten
such
seconds
of
suspense
as
i
have
rarely
known
the
spear
of
light
plunged
into
the
well
of
darkness
again
lord
southery
smith
and
myself
were
hidden
by
the
angle
of
the
wall
but
full
upon
the
purplish
face
of
henderson
the
beam
shone
in
some
way
it
penetrated
to
the
murk
in
his
mind
and
he
awakened
from
his
swoon
with
a
hoarse
cry
struggled
to
his
feet
and
stood
looking
up
the
stair
in
a
sort
of
frozen
horror
smith
was
past
him
at
a
bound
something
flashed
towards
him
as
the
light
was
extinguished
i
saw
him
duck
and
heard
the
knife
ring
upon
the
floor
i
managed
to
move
sufficiently
to
see
at
the
top
as
i
fired
up
the
stairs
the
yellow
face
of
to
see
the
gleaming
chatoyant
eyes
greenly
terrible
as
they
sought
to
pierce
the
gloom
a
flying
figure
was
racing
up
three
steps
at
a
time
that
of
a
brown
man
scantily
clad
he
stumbled
and
fell
by
which
i
knew
that
he
was
hit
but
went
on
again
smith
hard
on
his
heels
mr
henderson
i
cried
relight
the
lantern
and
take
charge
of
lord
southery
here
is
my
flask
on
the
floor
i
rely
upon
you
smith
revolver
spoke
again
as
i
went
bounding
up
the
stair
black
against
the
square
of
moonlight
i
saw
him
stagger
i
saw
him
fall
as
he
fell
for
the
third
time
i
heard
the
crack
of
his
revolver
instantly
i
was
at
his
side
somewhere
along
the
black
aisle
beneath
the
trees
receding
footsteps
pattered
are
you
hurt
smith
i
cried
anxiously
he
got
upon
his
feet
he
has
a
dacoit
with
him
he
replied
and
showed
me
the
long
curved
knife
which
he
held
in
his
hand
a
full
inch
of
the
blade
bloodstained
a
near
thing
for
me
petrie
i
heard
the
whir
of
a
restarted
motor
we
have
lost
him
said
smith
but
we
have
saved
lord
southery
i
said
will
credit
us
with
a
skill
as
great
as
his
own
we
must
get
to
the
car
smith
muttered
and
try
to
overtake
them
ugh
my
left
arm
is
useless
it
would
be
mere
waste
of
time
to
attempt
to
overtake
them
i
argued
for
we
have
no
idea
in
which
direction
they
will
proceed
i
have
a
very
good
idea
snapped
smith
stradwick
hall
is
less
than
ten
miles
from
the
coast
there
is
only
one
practicable
means
of
conveying
an
unconscious
man
secretly
from
here
to
london
you
think
he
meant
to
take
him
from
here
to
london
prior
to
shipping
him
to
china
i
think
so
his
is
probably
on
the
thames
a
boat
a
yacht
presumably
is
lying
off
the
coast
in
readiness
may
even
have
designed
to
ship
him
direct
to
china
lord
southery
a
bizarre
figure
my
traveling
coat
wrapped
about
him
and
supported
by
his
solicitor
who
was
almost
as
pale
as
himself
emerged
from
the
vault
into
the
moonlight
this
is
a
triumph
for
you
smith
i
said
the
throb
of
car
died
into
faintness
and
was
lost
in
the
night
silence
only
half
a
triumph
he
replied
but
we
still
have
another
chance
the
raid
on
his
house
when
will
the
word
come
from
karamaneh
southery
spoke
in
a
weak
voice
gentlemen
he
said
it
seems
i
am
raised
from
the
dead
it
was
the
weirdest
moment
of
the
night
wherein
we
heard
that
newly
buried
man
speak
from
the
mold
of
his
tomb
yes
replied
smith
slowly
and
spared
from
the
fate
of
heaven
alone
knows
how
many
men
of
genius
the
yellow
society
lacks
a
southery
but
that
was
in
germany
three
years
ago
i
have
reason
to
believe
so
that
even
without
visiting
the
grave
of
your
great
teutonic
rival
who
suddenly
died
at
about
that
time
i
venture
to
predict
that
they
have
a
von
homber
and
the
futurist
group
in
china
knows
how
to
make
men
work
chapter
xxiv
from
the
rescue
of
lord
southery
my
story
bears
me
mercilessly
on
to
other
things
i
may
not
tarry
as
more
leisurely
penmen
to
round
my
incidents
they
were
not
of
my
choosing
i
may
not
pause
to
make
you
better
acquainted
with
the
figure
of
my
drama
its
scheme
is
none
of
mine
often
enough
in
those
days
i
found
a
fitness
in
the
lines
of
omar
we
are
no
other
than
a
moving
show
of
magic
that
come
and
go
round
with
the
lantern
held
in
midnight
by
the
master
of
the
show
but
the
master
of
the
show
in
this
case
was
i
have
been
asked
many
times
since
the
days
with
which
these
records
deal
who
was
let
me
confess
here
that
my
final
answer
must
be
postponed
i
can
only
indicate
at
this
place
the
trend
of
my
reasoning
and
leave
my
reader
to
form
whatever
conclusion
he
pleases
what
group
can
we
isolate
and
label
as
responsible
for
the
overthrow
of
the
manchus
the
casual
student
of
modern
chinese
history
will
reply
young
china
this
is
unsatisfactory
what
do
we
mean
by
young
china
in
my
own
hearing
had
disclaimed
with
scorn
association
with
the
whole
of
that
movement
and
assuming
that
the
name
were
not
an
assumed
one
he
clearly
can
have
been
no
no
republican
the
chinese
republican
is
of
the
mandarin
class
but
of
a
new
generation
which
veneers
its
confucianism
with
western
polish
these
youthful
and
unbalanced
reformers
in
conjunction
with
older
but
no
less
provincial
politicians
may
be
said
to
represent
young
china
amid
such
turmoils
as
this
we
invariably
look
for
and
invariably
find
a
third
party
in
my
opinion
was
one
of
the
leaders
of
such
a
party
another
question
often
put
to
me
was
where
did
the
doctor
hide
during
the
time
that
he
pursued
his
operations
in
london
this
is
more
susceptible
of
explanation
for
a
time
nayland
smith
supposed
as
i
did
myself
that
the
opium
den
adjacent
to
the
old
ratcliff
highway
was
the
chinaman
base
of
operations
later
we
came
to
believe
that
the
mansion
near
windsor
was
his
and
later
still
the
hulk
lying
off
the
downstream
flats
but
i
think
i
can
state
with
confidence
that
the
spot
which
he
had
chosen
for
his
home
was
neither
of
these
but
the
east
end
riverside
building
which
i
was
the
first
to
enter
of
this
i
am
all
but
sure
for
the
reason
that
it
not
only
was
the
home
of
of
karamaneh
and
of
her
brother
aziz
but
the
home
of
something
else
of
something
which
i
shall
speak
of
later
the
dreadful
tragedy
or
series
of
tragedies
which
attended
the
raid
upon
the
place
will
always
mark
in
my
memory
the
supreme
horror
of
a
horrible
case
let
me
endeavor
to
explain
what
occurred
by
the
aid
of
karamaneh
you
have
seen
how
we
had
located
the
whilom
warehouse
which
from
the
exterior
was
so
drab
and
dreary
but
which
within
was
a
place
of
wondrous
luxury
at
the
moment
selected
by
our
beautiful
accomplice
inspector
weymouth
and
a
body
of
detectives
entirely
surrounded
it
a
river
police
launch
lay
off
the
wharf
which
opened
from
it
on
the
and
this
upon
a
singularly
black
night
than
which
a
better
could
not
have
been
chosen
you
will
fulfill
your
promise
to
me
said
karamaneh
and
looked
up
into
my
face
she
was
enveloped
in
a
big
loose
cloak
and
from
the
shadow
of
the
hood
her
wonderful
eyes
gleamed
out
like
stars
what
do
you
wish
us
to
do
asked
nayland
smith
you
and
petrie
she
replied
swiftly
must
enter
first
and
bring
out
aziz
until
he
is
safe
until
he
is
out
of
that
place
you
are
to
make
no
attempt
upon
upon
dr
interrupted
weymouth
for
karamaneh
hesitated
to
pronounce
the
dreaded
name
as
she
always
did
but
how
can
we
be
sure
that
there
is
no
trap
laid
for
us
the
scotland
yard
man
did
not
entirely
share
my
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
this
eastern
girl
whom
he
knew
to
have
been
a
creature
of
the
chinaman
aziz
lies
in
the
private
room
she
explained
eagerly
her
old
accent
more
noticeable
than
usual
there
is
only
one
of
the
burmese
men
in
the
house
and
he
he
dare
not
enter
without
orders
but
we
have
nothing
to
fear
from
him
he
will
be
your
prisoner
within
ten
minutes
from
now
i
have
no
time
for
words
you
must
believe
she
stamped
her
foot
impatiently
and
the
dacoit
snapped
smith
he
also
i
think
perhaps
i
better
come
in
too
said
weymouth
slowly
karamaneh
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
quick
impatience
and
unlocked
the
door
in
the
high
brick
wall
which
divided
the
gloomy
court
from
the
luxurious
apartments
of
make
no
noise
she
warned
and
smith
and
myself
followed
her
along
the
uncarpeted
passage
beyond
inspector
weymouth
with
a
final
word
of
instruction
to
his
second
in
command
brought
up
the
rear
the
door
was
reclosed
a
few
paces
farther
on
a
second
was
unlocked
passing
through
a
small
room
unfurnished
a
farther
passage
led
us
to
a
balcony
the
transition
was
startling
darkness
was
about
us
now
and
silence
a
perfumed
slumberous
darkness
a
silence
full
of
mystery
for
beyond
the
walls
of
the
apartment
whereon
we
looked
down
waged
the
unceasing
battle
of
sounds
that
is
the
hymn
of
the
great
industrial
river
about
the
scented
confines
which
bounded
us
now
floated
the
vapors
of
the
lower
thames
from
the
metallic
but
infinitely
human
clangor
of
life
from
the
unpleasant
but
homely
odors
which
prevail
where
ships
swallow
in
and
belch
out
the
concrete
evidences
of
commercial
prosperity
we
had
come
into
this
incensed
stillness
where
one
shaded
lamp
painted
dim
enlargements
of
its
chinese
silk
upon
the
nearer
walls
and
left
the
greater
part
of
the
room
the
darker
for
its
contrast
nothing
of
the
activity
of
the
riveting
and
scraping
the
bumping
of
bales
the
bawling
of
orders
the
hiss
of
steam
penetrated
to
this
perfumed
place
in
the
pool
of
tinted
light
lay
the
deathlike
figure
of
a
boy
karamaneh
muffled
form
bending
over
him
at
last
i
stand
in
the
house
of
dr
whispered
smith
despite
the
girl
assurance
we
knew
that
proximity
to
the
sinister
chinaman
must
be
fraught
with
danger
we
stood
not
in
the
lion
den
but
in
the
serpent
lair
from
the
time
when
nayland
smith
had
come
from
burma
in
pursuit
of
this
of
a
cogent
yellow
peril
the
face
of
rarely
had
been
absent
from
my
dreams
day
or
night
the
millions
might
sleep
in
peace
the
millions
in
whose
cause
we
labored
but
we
who
knew
the
reality
of
the
danger
knew
that
a
veritable
octopus
had
fastened
upon
england
a
yellow
octopus
whose
head
was
that
of
whose
tentacles
were
dacoity
thuggee
modes
of
death
secret
and
swift
which
in
the
darkness
plucked
men
from
life
and
left
no
clew
behind
karamaneh
i
called
softly
the
muffled
form
beneath
the
lamp
turned
so
that
the
soft
light
fell
upon
the
lovely
face
of
the
slave
girl
she
who
had
been
a
pliant
instrument
in
the
hands
of
now
was
to
be
the
means
whereby
society
should
be
rid
of
him
she
raised
her
finger
warningly
then
beckoned
me
to
approach
my
feet
sinking
in
the
rich
pile
of
the
carpet
i
came
through
the
gloom
of
the
great
apartment
in
to
the
patch
of
light
and
karamaneh
beside
me
stood
looking
down
upon
the
boy
it
was
aziz
her
brother
dead
so
far
as
western
lore
had
power
to
judge
but
kept
alive
in
that
deathlike
trance
by
the
uncanny
power
of
the
chinese
doctor
be
quick
she
said
be
quick
awaken
him
i
am
afraid
from
the
case
which
i
carried
i
took
out
a
and
a
phial
containing
a
small
quantity
of
liquid
it
was
a
drug
not
to
be
found
in
the
british
pharmacopoeia
of
its
constitution
i
knew
nothing
although
i
had
had
the
phial
in
my
possession
for
some
days
i
had
not
dared
to
devote
any
of
its
precious
contents
to
analytical
purposes
the
amber
drops
spelled
life
for
the
boy
aziz
spelled
success
for
the
mission
of
nayland
smith
spelled
ruin
for
the
fiendish
chinaman
i
raised
the
white
coverlet
the
boy
fully
dressed
lay
with
his
arms
crossed
upon
his
breast
i
discerned
the
mark
of
previous
injections
as
charging
the
syringe
from
the
phial
i
made
what
i
hoped
would
be
the
last
of
such
experiments
upon
him
i
would
have
given
half
of
my
small
worldly
possessions
to
have
known
the
real
nature
of
the
drug
which
was
now
coursing
through
the
veins
of
aziz
which
was
tinting
the
grayed
face
with
the
olive
tone
of
life
which
so
far
as
my
medical
training
bore
me
was
restoring
the
dead
to
life
but
such
was
not
the
purpose
of
my
visit
i
was
come
to
remove
from
the
house
of
the
living
chain
which
bound
karamaneh
to
him
the
boy
alive
and
free
the
doctor
hold
upon
the
slave
girl
would
be
broken
my
lovely
companion
her
hands
convulsively
clasped
knelt
and
devoured
with
her
eyes
the
face
of
the
boy
who
was
passing
through
the
most
amazing
physiological
change
in
the
history
of
therapeutics
the
peculiar
perfume
which
she
wore
which
seemed
to
be
a
part
of
her
which
always
i
associated
with
her
was
faintly
perceptible
karamaneh
was
breathing
rapidly
you
have
nothing
to
fear
i
whispered
see
he
is
reviving
in
a
few
moments
all
will
be
well
with
him
the
hanging
lamp
with
its
garishly
colored
shade
swung
gently
above
us
wafted
it
seemed
by
some
draught
which
passed
through
the
apartment
the
boy
heavy
lids
began
to
quiver
and
karamaneh
nervously
clutched
my
arm
and
held
me
so
whilst
we
watched
for
the
eyes
to
open
the
stillness
of
the
place
was
positively
unnatural
it
seemed
inconceivable
that
all
about
us
was
the
discordant
activity
of
the
commercial
east
end
indeed
this
eerie
silence
was
becoming
oppressive
it
began
positively
to
appall
me
inspector
weymouth
wondering
face
peeped
over
my
shoulder
where
is
dr
i
whispered
as
nayland
smith
in
turn
appeared
beside
me
i
can
not
understand
the
silence
of
the
house
look
about
replied
karamaneh
never
taking
her
eyes
from
the
face
of
aziz
i
peered
around
the
shadowy
walls
tall
glass
cases
there
were
shelves
and
niches
where
once
from
the
gallery
above
i
had
seen
the
tubes
and
retorts
the
jars
of
unfamiliar
organisms
the
books
of
unfamiliar
lore
the
impedimenta
of
the
occult
student
and
man
of
science
the
visible
evidences
of
presence
shelves
cases
niches
were
bare
of
the
complicated
appliances
unknown
to
civilized
laboratories
wherewith
he
pursued
his
strange
experiments
of
the
tubes
wherein
he
isolated
the
bacilli
of
unclassified
diseases
of
the
volumes
for
a
glimpse
at
which
had
they
known
of
their
contents
the
great
men
of
harley
street
would
have
given
a
fortune
no
trace
remained
the
silken
cushions
the
inlaid
tables
all
were
gone
the
room
was
stripped
dismantled
had
fled
the
silence
assumed
a
new
significance
his
dacoits
and
kindred
ministers
of
death
all
must
have
fled
too
you
have
let
him
escape
us
i
said
rapidly
you
promised
to
aid
us
to
capture
him
to
send
us
a
message
and
you
have
delayed
until
no
she
said
no
and
clutched
at
my
arm
again
oh
is
he
not
reviving
slowly
are
you
sure
you
have
made
no
mistake
her
thoughts
were
all
for
the
boy
and
her
solicitude
touched
me
i
again
examined
aziz
the
most
remarkable
patient
of
my
busy
professional
career
as
i
counted
the
strengthening
pulse
he
opened
his
dark
eyes
which
were
so
like
the
eyes
of
karamaneh
and
with
the
girl
eager
arms
tightly
about
him
sat
up
looking
wonderingly
around
karamaneh
pressed
her
cheek
to
his
whispering
loving
words
in
that
softly
spoken
arabic
which
had
first
betrayed
her
nationality
to
nayland
smith
i
handed
her
my
flask
which
i
had
filled
with
wine
my
promise
is
fulfilled
i
said
you
are
free
now
for
but
first
let
us
admit
the
police
to
this
house
there
is
something
uncanny
in
its
stillness
no
she
replied
first
let
my
brother
be
taken
out
and
placed
in
safety
will
you
carry
him
she
raised
her
face
to
that
of
inspector
weymouth
upon
which
was
written
awe
and
wonder
the
burly
detective
lifted
the
boy
as
tenderly
as
a
woman
passed
through
the
shadows
to
the
stairway
ascended
and
was
swallowed
up
in
the
gloom
nayland
smith
eyes
gleamed
feverishly
he
turned
to
karamaneh
you
are
not
playing
with
us
he
said
harshly
we
have
done
our
part
it
remains
for
you
to
do
yours
do
not
speak
so
loudly
the
girl
begged
he
is
near
us
and
oh
god
i
fear
him
so
where
is
he
persisted
my
friend
karamaneh
eyes
were
glassy
with
fear
now
you
must
not
touch
him
until
the
police
are
here
she
said
but
from
the
direction
of
her
quick
agitated
glances
i
knew
that
her
brother
safe
now
she
feared
for
me
and
for
me
alone
those
glances
sent
my
blood
dancing
for
karamaneh
was
an
eastern
jewel
which
any
man
of
flesh
and
blood
must
have
coveted
had
he
known
it
to
lie
within
his
reach
her
eyes
were
twin
lakes
of
mystery
which
more
than
once
i
had
known
the
desire
to
explore
look
beyond
that
curtain
her
voice
was
barely
audible
but
do
not
enter
even
as
he
is
i
fear
him
her
voice
her
palpable
agitation
prepared
us
for
something
extraordinary
tragedy
and
were
never
far
apart
though
we
were
two
and
help
was
so
near
we
were
in
the
abode
of
the
most
cunning
murderer
who
ever
came
out
of
the
east
it
was
with
strangely
mingled
emotions
that
i
crossed
the
thick
carpet
nayland
smith
beside
me
and
drew
aside
the
draperies
concealing
a
door
to
which
karamaneh
had
pointed
then
upon
looking
into
the
dim
place
beyond
all
else
save
what
it
held
was
forgotten
we
looked
upon
a
small
square
room
the
walls
draped
with
fantastic
chinese
tapestry
the
floor
strewn
with
cushions
and
reclining
in
a
corner
where
the
faint
blue
light
from
a
lamp
placed
upon
a
low
table
painted
grotesque
shadows
about
the
cavernous
face
was
at
sight
of
him
my
heart
leaped
and
seemed
to
suspend
its
functions
so
intense
was
the
horror
which
this
man
presence
inspired
in
me
my
hand
clutching
the
curtain
i
stood
watching
him
the
lids
veiled
the
malignant
green
eyes
but
the
thin
lips
seemed
to
smile
then
smith
silently
pointed
to
the
hand
which
held
a
little
pipe
a
sickly
perfume
assailed
my
nostrils
and
the
explanation
of
the
hushed
silence
and
the
ease
with
which
we
had
thus
far
executed
our
plan
came
to
me
the
cunning
mind
was
torpid
lost
in
a
brutish
world
of
dreams
was
in
an
opium
sleep
the
dim
light
traced
out
a
network
of
tiny
lines
which
covered
the
yellow
face
from
the
pointed
chin
to
the
top
of
the
great
domed
brow
and
formed
deep
shadow
pools
in
the
hollows
beneath
his
eyes
at
last
we
had
triumphed
i
could
not
determine
the
depth
of
his
obscene
trance
and
mastering
some
of
my
repugnance
and
forgetful
of
karamaneh
warning
i
was
about
to
step
forward
into
the
room
loaded
with
its
nauseating
opium
fumes
when
a
soft
breath
fanned
my
cheek
do
not
go
in
came
karamaneh
warning
voice
hushed
trembling
her
little
hand
grasped
my
arm
she
drew
smith
and
myself
back
from
the
door
there
is
danger
there
she
whispered
do
not
enter
that
room
the
police
must
reach
him
in
some
way
and
drag
him
out
do
not
enter
that
room
the
girl
voice
quivered
hysterically
her
eyes
blazed
into
savage
flame
the
fierce
resentment
born
of
dreadful
wrongs
was
consuming
her
now
but
fear
of
held
her
yet
inspector
weymouth
came
down
the
stairs
and
joined
us
i
have
sent
the
boy
to
ryman
room
at
the
station
he
said
the
divisional
surgeon
will
look
after
him
until
you
arrive
petrie
all
is
ready
now
the
launch
is
just
off
the
wharf
and
every
side
of
the
place
under
observation
where
our
man
he
drew
a
pair
of
handcuffs
from
his
pocket
and
raised
his
eyebrows
interrogatively
the
absence
of
sound
of
any
demonstration
from
the
uncanny
chinaman
whom
he
was
there
to
arrest
puzzled
him
nayland
smith
jerked
his
thumb
toward
the
curtain
at
that
and
before
we
could
utter
a
word
weymouth
stepped
to
the
draped
door
he
was
a
man
who
drove
straight
at
his
goal
and
saved
reflections
for
subsequent
leisure
i
think
moreover
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
stripped
as
it
was
it
retained
its
heavy
voluptuous
perfume
had
begun
to
get
a
hold
upon
him
he
was
anxious
to
shake
it
off
to
be
up
and
doing
he
pulled
the
curtain
aside
and
stepped
into
the
room
smith
and
i
perforce
followed
him
just
within
the
door
the
three
of
us
stood
looking
across
at
the
limp
thing
which
had
spread
terror
throughout
the
eastern
and
western
world
helpless
as
was
he
inspired
terror
now
though
the
giant
intellect
was
inert
stupefied
in
the
dimly
lit
apartment
we
had
quitted
i
heard
karamaneh
utter
a
stifled
scream
but
it
came
too
late
as
though
cast
up
by
a
volcano
the
silken
cushions
the
inlaid
table
with
its
lamp
the
garish
walls
the
sprawling
figure
with
the
ghastly
light
playing
upon
its
features
quivered
and
shot
upward
so
it
seemed
to
me
though
in
the
ensuing
instant
i
remembered
too
late
a
previous
experience
of
the
floors
of
private
apartments
i
knew
what
had
indeed
befallen
us
a
trap
had
been
released
beneath
our
feet
i
recall
falling
but
have
no
recollection
of
the
end
of
my
fall
of
the
shock
marking
the
drop
i
only
remember
fighting
for
my
life
against
a
stifling
something
which
had
me
by
the
throat
i
knew
that
i
was
being
suffocated
but
my
hands
met
only
the
deathly
emptiness
into
a
poisonous
well
of
darkness
i
sank
i
could
not
cry
out
i
was
helpless
of
the
fate
of
my
companions
i
knew
nothing
could
surmise
nothing
then
all
consciousness
ended
chapter
xxv
i
was
being
carried
along
a
dimly
lighted
place
slung
sackwise
across
the
shoulder
of
a
burman
he
was
not
a
big
man
but
he
supported
my
considerable
weight
with
apparent
ease
a
deadly
nausea
held
me
but
the
rough
handling
had
served
to
restore
me
to
consciousness
my
hands
and
feet
were
closely
lashed
i
hung
limply
as
a
wet
towel
i
felt
that
this
spark
of
tortured
life
which
had
flickered
up
in
me
must
ere
long
finally
become
extinguished
a
fancy
possessed
me
in
these
the
first
moments
of
my
restoration
to
the
world
of
realities
that
i
had
been
smuggled
into
china
and
as
i
swung
head
downward
i
told
myself
that
the
huge
puffy
things
which
strewed
the
path
were
a
species
of
giant
toadstool
unfamiliar
to
me
and
possibly
peculiar
to
whatever
district
of
china
i
now
was
in
the
air
was
hot
steamy
and
loaded
with
a
smell
as
of
rotting
vegetation
i
wondered
why
my
bearer
so
scrupulously
avoided
touching
any
of
the
growths
in
passing
through
what
seemed
a
succession
of
cellars
but
steered
a
tortuous
course
among
the
bloated
unnatural
shapes
lifting
his
bare
brown
feet
with
a
catlike
delicacy
he
passed
under
a
low
arch
dropped
me
roughly
to
the
ground
and
ran
back
half
stunned
i
lay
watching
the
agile
brown
body
melt
into
the
distances
of
the
cellars
their
walls
and
roof
seemed
to
emit
a
faint
phosphorescent
light
petrie
came
a
weak
voice
from
somewhere
ahead
is
that
you
petrie
it
was
nayland
smith
smith
i
said
and
strove
to
sit
up
but
the
intense
nausea
overcame
me
so
that
i
all
but
swooned
i
heard
his
voice
again
but
could
attach
no
meaning
to
the
words
which
he
uttered
a
sound
of
terrific
blows
reached
my
ears
too
the
burman
reappeared
bending
under
the
heavy
load
which
he
bore
for
as
he
picked
his
way
through
the
bloated
things
which
grew
upon
the
floors
of
the
cellars
i
realized
that
he
was
carrying
the
inert
body
of
inspector
weymouth
and
i
found
time
to
compare
the
strength
of
the
little
brown
man
with
that
of
a
nile
beetle
which
can
raise
many
times
its
own
weight
then
behind
him
appeared
a
second
figure
which
immediately
claimed
the
whole
of
my
errant
attention
hissed
my
friend
from
the
darkness
which
concealed
him
it
was
indeed
none
other
than
the
whom
we
had
thought
to
be
helpless
the
deeps
of
the
chinaman
cunning
the
fine
quality
of
his
courage
were
forced
upon
me
as
amazing
facts
he
had
assumed
the
appearance
of
a
drugged
so
well
as
to
dupe
me
a
medical
man
so
well
as
to
dupe
karamaneh
whose
experience
of
the
noxious
habit
probably
was
greater
than
my
own
and
with
the
gallows
dangling
before
him
he
had
waited
played
the
part
of
a
lure
whilst
a
body
of
police
actually
surrounded
the
place
i
have
since
thought
that
the
room
probably
was
one
which
he
actually
used
for
opium
debauches
and
the
device
of
the
trap
was
intended
to
protect
him
during
the
comatose
period
now
holding
a
lantern
above
his
head
the
deviser
of
the
trap
whereinto
we
mouselike
had
blindly
entered
came
through
the
cellars
following
the
brown
man
who
carried
weymouth
the
faint
rays
of
the
lantern
it
apparently
contained
a
candle
revealed
a
veritable
forest
of
the
gigantic
fungi
poisonously
colored
hideously
swollen
climbing
from
the
floor
up
the
slimy
walls
climbing
like
horrid
parasites
to
such
part
of
the
arched
roof
as
was
visible
to
me
picked
his
way
through
the
fungi
ranks
as
daintily
as
though
the
distorted
tumid
things
had
been
the
resounding
blows
which
i
had
noted
before
and
which
had
never
ceased
culminated
in
a
splintering
crash
and
his
servant
who
carried
the
apparently
insensible
detective
passed
in
under
the
arch
glancing
back
once
along
the
passages
the
lantern
he
extinguished
or
concealed
and
whilst
i
waited
my
mind
dully
surveying
memories
of
all
the
threats
which
this
uncanny
being
had
uttered
a
distant
clamor
came
to
my
ears
then
abruptly
it
ceased
had
closed
a
heavy
door
and
to
my
surprise
i
perceived
that
the
greater
part
of
it
was
of
glass
the
glow
which
played
around
the
fungi
rendered
the
vista
of
the
cellars
faintly
luminous
and
visible
to
me
from
where
i
lay
spoke
softly
his
voice
its
guttural
note
alternating
with
a
sibilance
on
certain
words
betrayed
no
traces
of
agitation
the
man
unbroken
calm
had
in
it
something
inhuman
for
he
had
just
perpetrated
an
act
of
daring
unparalleled
in
my
experience
and
in
the
clamor
now
shut
out
by
the
glass
door
i
tardily
recognized
the
entrance
of
the
police
into
some
barricaded
part
of
the
house
the
coming
of
those
who
would
save
us
who
would
hold
the
chinese
doctor
for
the
hangman
i
have
decided
he
said
deliberately
that
you
are
more
worthy
of
my
attention
than
i
had
formerly
supposed
a
man
who
can
solve
the
secret
of
the
golden
elixir
i
had
not
solved
it
i
had
merely
stolen
some
should
be
a
valuable
acquisition
to
my
council
the
extent
of
the
plans
of
commissioner
nayland
smith
and
of
the
english
scotland
yard
it
is
incumbent
upon
me
to
learn
therefore
gentlemen
you
live
for
the
present
and
you
swing
came
weymouth
hoarse
voice
in
the
near
future
you
and
all
your
yellow
gang
i
trust
not
was
the
placid
reply
most
of
my
people
are
safe
some
are
shipped
as
lascars
upon
the
liners
others
have
departed
by
different
means
ah
that
last
word
was
the
only
one
indicative
of
excitement
which
had
yet
escaped
him
a
disk
of
light
danced
among
the
brilliant
poison
hues
of
the
passages
but
no
sound
reached
us
by
which
i
knew
that
the
glass
door
must
fit
almost
hermetically
it
was
much
cooler
here
than
in
the
place
through
which
we
had
passed
and
the
nausea
began
to
leave
me
my
brain
to
grow
more
clear
had
i
known
what
was
to
follow
i
should
have
cursed
the
lucidity
of
mind
which
now
came
to
me
i
should
have
prayed
for
oblivion
to
be
spared
the
sight
of
that
which
ensued
it
logan
cried
inspector
weymouth
and
i
could
tell
that
he
was
struggling
to
free
himself
of
his
bonds
from
his
voice
it
was
evident
that
he
too
was
recovering
from
the
effects
of
the
narcotic
which
had
been
administered
to
us
all
logan
he
cried
logan
this
way
help
but
the
cry
beat
back
upon
us
in
that
enclosed
space
and
seemed
to
carry
no
farther
than
the
invisible
walls
of
our
prison
the
door
fits
well
came
mocking
voice
it
is
fortunate
for
us
all
that
it
is
so
this
is
my
observation
window
petrie
and
you
are
about
to
enjoy
an
unique
opportunity
of
studying
fungology
i
have
already
drawn
your
attention
to
the
anaesthetic
properties
of
the
lycoperdon
or
common
you
may
have
recognized
the
fumes
the
chamber
into
which
you
rashly
precipitated
yourselves
was
charged
with
them
by
a
process
of
my
own
i
have
greatly
enhanced
the
value
of
the
in
this
respect
your
friend
weymouth
proved
the
most
obstinate
subject
but
he
succumbed
in
fifteen
seconds
logan
help
help
this
way
man
something
very
like
fear
sounded
in
weymouth
voice
now
indeed
the
situation
was
so
uncanny
that
it
almost
seemed
unreal
a
group
of
men
had
entered
the
farthermost
cellars
led
by
one
who
bore
an
electric
the
hard
white
ray
danced
from
bloated
gray
fungi
to
others
of
nightmare
shape
of
dazzling
venomous
brilliance
the
mocking
voice
continued
note
the
snowy
growth
upon
the
roof
doctor
do
not
be
deceived
by
its
size
it
is
a
giant
variety
of
my
own
culture
and
is
of
the
order
empusa
you
in
england
are
familiar
with
the
death
of
the
common
which
is
found
attached
to
the
by
a
coating
of
white
mold
i
have
developed
the
spores
of
this
mold
and
have
produced
a
giant
species
observe
the
interesting
effect
of
the
strong
light
upon
my
orange
and
blue
amanita
fungus
hard
beside
me
i
heard
nayland
smith
groan
weymouth
had
become
suddenly
silent
for
my
own
part
i
could
have
shrieked
in
pure
horror
for
i
knew
what
was
coming
i
realized
in
one
agonized
instant
the
significance
of
the
dim
lantern
of
the
careful
progress
through
the
subterranean
fungi
grove
of
the
care
with
which
and
his
servant
had
avoided
touching
any
of
the
growths
i
knew
now
that
was
the
greatest
fungologist
the
world
had
ever
known
was
a
poisoner
to
whom
the
borgias
were
as
children
and
i
knew
that
the
detectives
blindly
were
walking
into
a
valley
of
death
then
it
began
the
unnatural
scene
the
saturnalia
of
murder
like
so
many
bombs
the
brilliantly
colored
caps
of
the
huge
things
alluded
to
by
the
chinaman
exploded
as
the
white
ray
sought
them
out
in
the
darkness
which
alone
preserved
their
existence
a
brownish
cloud
i
could
not
determine
whether
liquid
or
powdery
arose
in
the
cellar
i
tried
to
close
my
eyes
or
to
turn
them
away
from
the
reeling
forms
of
the
men
who
were
trapped
in
that
it
was
useless
i
must
look
the
bearer
of
the
lamp
had
dropped
it
but
the
dim
eerily
illuminated
gloom
endured
scarce
a
second
a
bright
light
sprang
up
doubtless
at
the
touch
of
the
fiendish
being
who
now
resumed
speech
observe
the
symptoms
of
delirium
doctor
out
there
beyond
the
glass
door
the
unhappy
victims
were
laughing
tearing
their
garments
from
their
bodies
leaping
waving
their
arms
were
become
maniacs
we
will
now
release
the
ripe
spores
of
giant
entpusa
continued
the
wicked
voice
the
air
of
the
second
cellar
being
with
oxygen
they
immediately
germinate
ah
it
is
a
triumph
that
process
is
the
scientific
triumph
of
my
life
like
powdered
snow
the
white
spores
fell
from
the
roof
frosting
the
writhing
shapes
of
the
already
poisoned
men
before
my
horrified
gaze
the
fungus
grew
it
spread
from
the
head
to
the
feet
of
those
it
touched
it
enveloped
them
as
in
glittering
shrouds
they
die
like
flies
screamed
with
a
sudden
febrile
excitement
and
i
felt
assured
of
something
i
had
long
suspected
that
that
magnificent
perverted
brain
was
the
brain
of
a
homicidal
maniac
though
smith
would
never
accept
the
theory
it
is
my
shrieked
the
chinaman
and
i
am
the
god
of
destruction
chapter
xxvi
the
clammy
touch
of
the
mist
revived
me
the
culmination
of
the
scene
in
the
poison
cellars
together
with
the
effects
of
the
fumes
which
i
had
inhaled
again
had
deprived
me
of
consciousness
now
i
knew
that
i
was
afloat
on
the
river
i
still
was
bound
furthermore
a
cloth
was
wrapped
tightly
about
my
mouth
and
i
was
secured
to
a
ring
in
the
deck
by
moving
my
aching
head
to
the
left
i
could
look
down
into
the
oily
water
by
moving
it
to
the
right
i
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
empurpled
face
of
inspector
weymouth
who
similarly
bound
and
gagged
lay
beside
me
but
only
of
the
feet
and
legs
of
nayland
smith
for
i
could
not
turn
my
head
sufficiently
far
to
see
more
we
were
aboard
an
electric
launch
i
heard
the
hated
guttural
voice
of
subdued
now
to
its
habitual
calm
and
my
heart
leaped
to
hear
the
voice
that
answered
him
it
was
that
of
karamaneh
his
triumph
was
complete
clearly
his
plans
for
departure
were
complete
his
slaughter
of
the
police
in
the
underground
passages
had
been
a
final
reckless
demonstration
of
which
the
chinaman
subtle
cunning
would
have
been
incapable
had
he
not
known
his
escape
from
the
country
to
be
assured
what
fate
was
in
store
for
us
how
would
he
avenge
himself
upon
the
girl
who
had
betrayed
him
to
his
enemies
what
portion
awaited
those
enemies
he
seemed
to
have
formed
the
singular
determination
to
smuggle
me
into
china
but
what
did
he
purpose
in
the
case
of
weymouth
and
in
the
case
of
nayland
smith
all
but
silently
we
were
feeling
our
way
through
the
mist
astern
died
the
clangor
of
dock
and
wharf
into
a
remote
discord
ahead
hung
the
foggy
curtain
veiling
the
traffic
of
the
great
waterway
but
through
it
broke
the
calling
of
sirens
the
tinkling
of
bells
the
gentle
movement
of
the
screw
ceased
altogether
the
launch
lay
heaving
slightly
upon
the
swells
a
distant
throbbing
grew
louder
and
something
advanced
upon
us
through
the
haze
a
bell
rang
and
muffled
by
the
fog
a
voice
proclaimed
itself
a
voice
which
i
knew
i
felt
weymouth
writhing
impotently
beside
me
heard
him
mumbling
incoherently
and
i
knew
that
he
too
had
recognized
the
voice
it
was
that
of
inspector
ryman
of
the
river
police
and
their
launch
was
within
of
that
upon
which
we
lay
i
trembled
a
feverish
excitement
claimed
me
they
were
hailing
us
we
carried
no
lights
but
now
and
ignoring
the
pain
which
shot
from
my
spine
to
my
skull
i
craned
my
neck
to
the
left
the
port
light
of
the
police
launch
glowed
angrily
through
the
mist
i
was
unable
to
utter
any
save
mumbling
sounds
and
my
companions
were
equally
helpless
it
was
a
desperate
position
had
the
police
seen
us
or
had
they
hailed
at
random
the
light
drew
nearer
launch
they
had
seen
us
guttural
voice
spoke
shortly
and
our
screw
began
to
revolve
again
we
leaped
ahead
into
the
bank
of
darkness
faint
grew
the
light
of
the
police
launch
and
was
gone
but
i
heard
ryman
voice
shouting
full
speed
came
faintly
through
the
darkness
port
port
then
the
murk
closed
down
and
with
our
friends
far
astern
of
us
we
were
racing
deeper
into
the
fog
banks
speeding
seaward
though
of
this
i
was
unable
to
judge
at
the
time
on
we
raced
and
on
sweeping
over
growing
swells
once
a
black
towering
shape
dropped
down
upon
us
far
above
lights
blazed
bells
rang
vague
cries
pierced
the
fog
the
launch
pitched
and
rolled
perilously
but
weathered
the
wash
of
the
liner
which
so
nearly
had
concluded
this
episode
it
was
such
a
journey
as
i
had
taken
once
before
early
in
our
pursuit
of
the
genius
of
the
yellow
peril
but
this
was
infinitely
more
terrible
for
now
we
were
utterly
in
power
a
voice
mumbled
in
my
ear
i
turned
my
face
and
inspector
weymouth
raised
his
hands
in
the
dimness
and
partly
slipped
the
bandage
from
his
mouth
i
been
working
at
the
cords
since
we
left
those
filthy
cellars
he
whispered
my
wrists
are
all
cut
but
when
i
got
out
a
knife
and
freed
my
ankles
smith
had
kicked
him
with
his
bound
feet
the
detective
slipped
the
bandage
back
to
position
and
placed
his
hands
behind
him
again
wearing
a
heavy
overcoat
but
no
hat
came
aft
he
was
dragging
karamaneh
by
the
wrists
he
seated
himself
on
the
cushions
near
to
us
pulling
the
girl
down
beside
him
now
i
could
see
her
face
and
the
expression
in
her
beautiful
eyes
made
me
writhe
was
watching
us
his
discolored
teeth
faintly
visible
in
the
dim
light
to
which
my
eyes
were
becoming
accustomed
petrie
he
said
you
shall
be
my
honored
guest
at
my
home
in
china
you
shall
assist
me
to
revolutionize
chemistry
smith
i
fear
you
know
more
of
my
plans
than
i
had
deemed
it
possible
for
you
to
have
learned
and
i
am
anxious
to
know
if
you
have
a
confidant
where
your
memory
fails
you
and
my
files
and
wire
jackets
prove
ineffectual
inspector
weymouth
recollections
may
prove
more
accurate
he
turned
to
the
cowering
girl
who
shrank
away
from
him
in
pitiful
abject
terror
in
my
hands
doctor
he
continued
i
hold
a
needle
charged
with
a
rare
culture
it
is
the
link
between
the
bacilli
and
the
fungi
you
have
seemed
to
display
an
undue
interest
in
the
peach
and
pearl
which
render
my
karamaneh
so
delightful
in
the
supple
grace
of
her
movements
and
the
sparkle
of
her
eyes
you
can
never
devote
your
whole
mind
to
those
studies
which
i
have
planned
for
you
whilst
such
distractions
exist
a
touch
of
this
keen
point
and
the
laughing
karamaneh
becomes
the
shrieking
hag
the
maniacal
mowing
then
with
an
rush
weymouth
was
upon
him
karamaneh
wrought
upon
past
endurance
with
a
sobbing
cry
sank
to
the
deck
and
lay
still
i
managed
to
writhe
into
a
posture
and
smith
rolled
aside
as
the
detective
and
the
chinaman
crashed
down
together
weymouth
had
one
big
hand
at
the
doctor
yellow
throat
with
his
left
he
grasped
the
chinaman
right
it
held
the
needle
now
i
could
look
along
the
length
of
the
little
craft
and
so
far
as
it
was
possible
to
make
out
in
the
fog
only
one
other
was
aboard
the
brown
man
who
navigated
her
and
who
had
carried
us
through
the
cellars
the
murk
had
grown
denser
and
now
shut
us
in
like
a
box
the
throb
of
the
motor
the
hissing
breath
of
the
two
who
fought
with
so
much
at
issue
these
sounds
and
the
wash
of
the
water
alone
broke
the
eerie
stillness
by
slow
degrees
and
with
a
reptilian
agility
horrible
to
watch
was
neutralizing
the
advantage
gained
by
weymouth
his
clawish
fingers
were
fast
in
the
big
man
throat
the
right
hand
with
its
deadly
needle
was
forcing
down
the
left
of
his
opponent
he
had
been
underneath
but
now
he
was
gaining
the
upper
place
his
powers
of
physical
endurance
must
have
been
truly
marvelous
his
breath
was
whistling
through
his
nostrils
significantly
but
weymouth
was
palpably
tiring
the
latter
suddenly
changed
his
tactics
by
a
supreme
effort
to
which
he
was
spurred
i
think
by
the
growing
proximity
of
the
needle
he
raised
by
the
throat
and
arm
and
pitched
him
sideways
the
chinaman
grip
did
not
relax
and
the
two
wrestlers
dropped
a
writhing
mass
upon
the
port
cushions
the
launch
heeled
over
and
my
cry
of
horror
was
crushed
back
into
my
throat
by
the
bandage
for
as
sought
to
extricate
himself
he
overbalanced
fell
back
and
bearing
weymouth
with
him
slid
into
the
river
the
mist
swallowed
them
up
there
are
moments
of
which
no
man
can
recall
his
mental
impressions
moments
so
acutely
horrible
that
mercifully
our
memory
retains
nothing
of
the
emotions
they
occasioned
this
was
one
of
them
a
chaos
ruled
in
my
mind
i
had
a
vague
belief
that
the
burman
forward
glanced
back
then
the
course
of
the
launch
was
changed
how
long
intervened
between
the
tragic
end
of
that
gargantuan
struggle
and
the
time
when
a
black
wall
leaped
suddenly
up
before
us
i
can
not
pretend
to
state
with
a
sickening
jerk
we
ran
aground
a
loud
explosion
ensued
and
i
clearly
remember
seeing
the
brown
man
leap
out
into
the
fog
which
was
the
last
i
saw
of
him
water
began
to
wash
aboard
fully
alive
to
our
imminent
peril
i
fought
with
the
cords
that
bound
me
but
i
lacked
poor
weymouth
strength
of
wrist
and
i
began
to
accept
as
a
horrible
and
imminent
possibility
a
death
from
drowning
within
six
feet
of
the
bank
beside
me
nayland
smith
was
straining
and
twisting
i
think
his
object
was
to
touch
karamaneh
in
the
hope
of
arousing
her
where
he
failed
in
his
project
the
inflowing
water
succeeded
a
silent
prayer
of
thankfulness
came
from
my
very
soul
when
i
saw
her
stir
when
i
saw
her
raise
her
hands
to
her
head
and
saw
the
big
eyes
gleam
through
the
mist
veil
chapter
xxvii
we
quitted
the
wrecked
launch
but
a
few
seconds
before
her
stern
settled
down
into
the
river
where
the
upon
which
we
found
ourselves
was
situated
we
had
no
idea
but
at
least
it
was
terra
firma
and
we
were
free
from
smith
stood
looking
out
towards
the
river
my
god
he
groaned
my
god
he
was
thinking
as
i
was
of
weymouth
and
when
an
hour
later
the
police
boat
located
us
on
the
below
greenwich
and
we
heard
that
the
toll
of
the
poison
cellars
was
eight
men
we
also
heard
news
of
our
brave
companion
back
there
in
the
fog
sir
reported
inspector
ryman
who
was
in
charge
and
his
voice
was
under
poor
command
there
was
an
uncanny
howling
and
peals
of
laughter
that
i
going
to
dream
about
for
weeks
karamaneh
who
nestled
beside
me
like
a
frightened
child
shivered
and
i
knew
that
the
needle
had
done
its
work
despite
weymouth
giant
strength
smith
swallowed
noisily
pray
god
the
river
has
that
yellow
satan
he
said
i
would
sacrifice
a
year
of
my
life
to
see
his
rat
body
on
the
end
of
a
we
were
a
sad
party
that
steamed
through
the
fog
homeward
that
night
it
seemed
almost
like
deserting
a
staunch
comrade
to
leave
the
spot
so
nearly
as
we
could
locate
it
where
weymouth
had
put
up
that
last
gallant
fight
our
helplessness
was
pathetic
and
although
had
the
night
been
clear
as
crystal
i
doubt
if
we
could
have
acted
otherwise
it
came
to
me
that
this
stinking
murk
was
a
new
enemy
which
drove
us
back
in
coward
retreat
but
so
many
were
the
calls
upon
our
activity
and
so
numerous
the
stimulants
to
our
initiative
in
those
times
that
soon
we
had
matter
to
relieve
our
minds
from
this
stress
of
sorrow
there
was
karamaneh
to
be
considered
karamaneh
and
her
brother
a
brief
counsel
was
held
whereat
it
was
decided
that
for
the
present
they
should
be
lodged
at
a
hotel
i
shall
arrange
smith
whispered
to
me
for
the
girl
was
watching
us
to
have
the
place
patrolled
night
and
day
you
can
not
suppose
petrie
i
can
not
and
dare
not
suppose
dead
until
with
my
own
eyes
i
have
seen
him
so
accordingly
we
conveyed
the
beautiful
oriental
girl
and
her
brother
away
from
that
luxurious
abode
in
its
sordid
setting
i
will
not
dwell
upon
the
final
scene
in
the
poison
cellars
lest
i
be
accused
of
accumulating
horror
for
horror
sake
members
of
the
fire
brigade
helmed
against
contagion
brought
out
the
bodies
of
the
victims
wrapped
in
their
living
shrouds
from
karamaneh
we
learned
much
of
little
of
herself
what
am
i
does
my
poor
history
matter
to
anyone
was
her
answer
to
questions
respecting
herself
and
she
would
droop
her
lashes
over
her
dark
eyes
the
dacoits
whom
the
chinaman
had
brought
to
england
originally
numbered
seven
we
learned
as
you
having
followed
me
thus
far
will
be
aware
we
had
thinned
the
ranks
of
the
burmans
probably
only
one
now
remained
in
england
they
had
lived
in
a
camp
in
the
grounds
of
the
house
near
windsor
which
as
we
had
learned
at
the
time
of
its
destruction
the
doctor
had
bought
outright
the
thames
had
been
his
highway
other
members
of
the
group
had
occupied
quarters
in
various
parts
of
the
east
end
where
sailormen
of
all
nationalities
congregate
had
been
the
east
end
headquarters
he
had
employed
the
hulk
from
the
time
of
his
arrival
as
a
laboratory
for
a
certain
class
of
experiments
undesirable
in
proximity
to
a
place
of
residence
nayland
smith
asked
the
girl
on
one
occasion
if
the
chinaman
had
had
a
private
vessel
and
she
replied
in
the
affirmative
she
had
never
been
on
board
however
had
never
even
set
eyes
upon
it
and
could
give
us
no
information
respecting
its
character
it
had
sailed
for
china
you
are
sure
asked
smith
keenly
that
it
has
actually
left
i
understood
so
and
that
we
were
to
follow
by
another
route
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
to
travel
by
a
passenger
boat
i
can
not
say
what
were
his
plans
in
a
state
of
singular
uncertainty
then
readily
to
be
understood
we
passed
the
days
following
the
tragedy
which
had
deprived
us
of
our
vividly
i
recall
the
scene
at
poor
weymouth
home
on
the
day
that
we
visited
it
i
then
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
inspector
brother
nayland
smith
gave
him
a
detailed
account
of
the
last
scene
out
there
in
the
mist
he
concluded
wearily
it
all
seemed
very
unreal
i
wish
to
god
it
had
been
amen
to
that
weymouth
but
your
brother
made
a
gallant
finish
if
ridding
the
world
of
were
the
only
good
deed
to
his
credit
his
life
had
been
well
spent
james
weymouth
smoked
awhile
in
thoughtful
silence
though
but
four
and
a
half
miles
of
paul
the
quaint
little
cottage
with
its
rustic
garden
shadowed
by
the
tall
trees
which
had
so
lined
the
village
street
before
motor
were
was
a
spot
as
peaceful
and
secluded
as
any
in
broad
england
but
another
shadow
lay
upon
it
chilling
fearful
an
incarnate
evil
had
come
out
of
the
dim
east
and
in
its
dying
malevolence
had
touched
this
home
there
are
two
things
i
do
understand
about
it
sir
continued
weymouth
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
horrible
laughter
which
the
river
police
heard
in
the
fog
and
where
are
the
bodies
karamaneh
seated
beside
me
shuddered
at
the
words
smith
whose
restless
spirit
granted
him
little
repose
paused
in
his
aimless
wanderings
about
the
room
and
looked
at
her
in
these
latter
days
of
his
augean
labors
to
purge
england
of
the
unclean
thing
which
had
fastened
upon
her
my
friend
was
more
lean
and
than
i
had
ever
known
him
his
long
residence
in
burma
had
rendered
him
spare
and
had
burned
his
naturally
dark
skin
to
a
coppery
hue
but
now
his
gray
eyes
had
grown
feverishly
bright
and
his
face
so
lean
as
at
times
to
appear
positively
emaciated
but
i
knew
that
he
was
as
fit
as
ever
this
lady
may
be
able
to
answer
your
first
question
he
said
she
and
her
brother
were
for
some
time
in
the
household
of
in
fact
weymouth
karamaneh
as
her
name
implies
was
a
slave
weymouth
glanced
at
the
beautiful
troubled
face
with
scarcely
veiled
distrust
you
do
look
as
though
you
had
come
from
china
miss
he
said
with
a
sort
of
unwilling
admiration
i
do
not
come
from
china
replied
karamaneh
my
father
was
a
pure
bedawee
but
my
history
does
not
matter
at
times
there
was
something
imperious
in
her
manner
and
to
this
her
musical
accent
added
force
when
your
brave
brother
inspector
weymouth
and
were
swallowed
up
by
the
river
held
a
poisoned
needle
in
his
hand
the
laughter
meant
that
the
needle
had
done
its
work
your
brother
had
become
mad
weymouth
turned
aside
to
hide
his
emotion
what
was
on
the
needle
he
asked
huskily
it
was
something
which
he
prepared
from
the
venom
of
a
kind
of
swamp
adder
she
answered
it
produces
madness
but
not
always
death
he
would
have
had
a
poor
chance
said
smith
even
had
he
been
in
complete
possession
of
his
senses
at
the
time
of
the
encounter
we
must
have
been
some
considerable
distance
from
shore
and
the
fog
was
impenetrable
but
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
neither
of
the
bodies
have
been
recovered
ryman
of
the
river
police
tells
me
that
persons
lost
at
that
point
are
not
always
recovered
or
not
until
a
considerable
time
later
there
was
a
faint
sound
from
the
room
above
the
news
of
that
tragic
happening
out
in
the
mist
upon
the
thames
had
prostrated
poor
weymouth
she
has
been
told
half
the
truth
said
her
she
does
know
about
the
poisoned
needle
what
kind
of
fiend
was
this
dr
he
burst
out
into
a
sudden
blaze
of
furious
resentment
john
never
told
me
much
and
you
have
let
mighty
little
leak
into
the
papers
what
was
he
who
was
he
half
he
addressed
the
words
to
smith
half
to
karamaneh
replied
the
former
was
the
ultimate
expression
of
chinese
cunning
a
phenomenon
such
as
occurs
but
once
in
many
generations
he
was
a
superman
of
incredible
genius
who
had
he
willed
could
have
revolutionized
science
there
is
a
superstition
in
some
parts
of
china
according
to
which
under
certain
peculiar
conditions
one
of
which
is
proximity
to
a
deserted
an
evil
spirit
of
incredible
age
may
enter
unto
the
body
of
a
infant
all
my
efforts
thus
far
have
not
availed
me
to
trace
the
genealogy
of
the
man
called
even
karamaneh
can
not
help
me
in
this
but
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
he
was
a
member
of
a
certain
very
old
kiangsu
family
and
that
the
peculiar
conditions
i
have
mentioned
prevailed
at
his
birth
smith
observing
our
looks
of
amazement
laughed
shortly
and
quite
mirthlessly
poor
old
weymouth
he
jerked
i
suppose
my
labors
are
finished
but
i
am
far
from
triumphant
is
there
any
improvement
in
condition
very
little
was
the
reply
she
has
lain
in
a
state
since
the
news
came
no
one
had
any
idea
she
would
take
it
so
at
one
time
we
were
afraid
her
brain
was
going
she
seemed
to
have
delusions
smith
spun
round
upon
weymouth
of
what
nature
he
asked
rapidly
the
other
pulled
nervously
at
his
mustache
my
wife
has
been
staying
with
her
he
explained
since
it
happened
and
for
the
last
three
nights
poor
john
widow
has
cried
out
at
the
same
time
two
that
someone
was
knocking
on
the
door
what
door
that
door
yonder
the
street
door
all
our
eyes
turned
in
the
direction
indicated
john
often
came
home
at
two
from
the
yard
continued
weymouth
so
we
naturally
thought
poor
mary
was
wandering
in
her
mind
but
last
night
and
it
not
to
be
wondered
at
my
wife
could
sleep
and
she
was
wide
awake
at
two
well
nayland
smith
was
standing
before
him
alert
she
heard
it
too
the
sun
was
streaming
into
the
cozy
little
but
i
will
confess
that
weymouth
words
chilled
me
uncannily
karamaneh
laid
her
hand
upon
mine
in
a
quaint
childish
fashion
peculiarly
her
own
her
hand
was
cold
but
its
touch
thrilled
me
for
karamaneh
was
not
a
child
but
a
rarely
beautiful
girl
a
pearl
of
the
east
such
as
many
a
monarch
has
fought
for
what
then
asked
smith
she
was
afraid
to
move
afraid
to
look
from
the
window
my
friend
turned
and
stared
hard
at
me
a
subjective
hallucination
petrie
in
all
probability
i
replied
you
should
arrange
that
your
wife
be
relieved
in
her
trying
duties
weymouth
it
is
too
great
a
strain
for
an
inexperienced
nurse
chapter
xxviii
of
all
that
we
had
hoped
for
in
our
pursuit
of
how
little
had
we
accomplished
excepting
karamaneh
and
her
brother
who
were
victims
and
not
creatures
of
the
chinese
doctor
not
one
of
the
formidable
group
had
fallen
alive
into
our
hands
dreadful
crimes
had
marked
passage
through
the
land
not
of
the
truth
and
nothing
of
the
later
developments
had
been
made
public
nayland
smith
authority
was
sufficient
to
control
the
press
in
the
absence
of
such
a
veto
a
veritable
panic
must
have
seized
upon
the
entire
country
for
a
monster
a
thing
more
than
humanly
evil
existed
in
our
midst
always
secret
activities
had
centered
about
the
great
waterway
there
was
much
of
poetic
justice
in
his
end
for
the
thames
had
claimed
him
who
so
long
had
used
the
stream
as
a
highway
for
the
passage
to
and
fro
for
his
secret
forces
gone
now
were
the
yellow
men
who
had
been
the
instruments
of
his
evil
will
gone
was
the
giant
intellect
which
had
controlled
the
complex
murder
machine
karamaneh
whose
beauty
he
had
used
as
a
lure
at
last
was
free
and
no
more
with
her
smile
would
tempt
men
to
death
that
her
brother
might
live
many
there
are
i
doubt
not
who
will
regard
the
eastern
girl
with
horror
i
ask
their
forgiveness
in
that
i
regarded
her
quite
differently
no
man
having
seen
her
could
have
condemned
her
unheard
many
having
looked
into
her
lovely
eyes
had
they
found
there
what
i
found
must
have
forgiven
her
almost
any
crime
that
she
valued
human
life
but
little
was
no
matter
for
wonder
her
nationality
her
history
furnished
adequate
excuse
for
an
attitude
not
condonable
in
a
european
equally
cultured
but
indeed
let
me
confess
that
hers
was
a
nature
incomprehensible
to
me
in
some
respects
the
soul
of
karamaneh
was
a
closed
book
to
my
western
eyes
but
the
body
of
karamaneh
was
exquisite
her
beauty
of
a
kind
that
was
a
key
to
the
most
extravagant
rhapsodies
of
eastern
poets
her
eyes
held
a
challenge
wholly
oriental
in
its
appeal
her
lips
even
in
repose
were
a
taunt
and
herein
east
is
west
and
west
is
east
finally
despite
her
lurid
history
despite
the
scornful
of
which
i
knew
her
capable
she
was
an
unprotected
girl
in
years
i
believe
a
mere
child
whom
fate
had
cast
in
my
way
at
her
request
we
had
booked
passages
for
her
brother
and
herself
to
egypt
the
boat
sailed
in
three
days
but
karamaneh
beautiful
eyes
were
sad
often
i
detected
tears
on
the
black
lashes
shall
i
endeavor
to
describe
my
own
tumultuous
conflicting
emotions
it
would
be
useless
since
i
know
it
to
be
impossible
for
in
those
dark
eyes
burned
a
fire
i
might
not
see
those
silken
lashes
veiled
a
message
i
dared
not
read
nayland
smith
was
not
blind
to
the
facts
of
the
complicated
situation
i
can
truthfully
assert
that
he
was
the
only
man
of
my
acquaintance
who
having
come
in
contact
with
karamaneh
had
kept
his
head
we
endeavored
to
divert
her
mind
from
the
recent
tragedies
by
a
round
of
amusements
though
with
poor
weymouth
body
still
at
the
mercy
of
unknown
waters
smith
and
i
made
but
a
poor
show
of
gayety
and
i
took
a
gloomy
pride
in
the
admiration
which
our
lovely
companion
everywhere
excited
i
learned
in
those
days
how
rare
a
thing
in
nature
is
a
really
beautiful
woman
one
afternoon
we
found
ourselves
at
an
exhibition
of
water
colors
in
bond
street
karamaneh
was
intensely
interested
in
the
subjects
of
the
drawings
which
were
entirely
egyptian
as
usual
she
furnished
matter
for
comment
amongst
the
other
visitors
as
did
the
boy
aziz
her
brother
anew
upon
the
world
from
his
living
grave
in
the
house
of
suddenly
aziz
clutched
at
his
sister
arm
whispering
rapidly
in
arabic
i
saw
her
peachlike
color
fade
saw
her
become
pale
and
the
haunted
karamaneh
of
the
old
days
she
turned
to
me
petrie
he
says
that
is
here
where
nayland
smith
rapped
out
the
question
violently
turning
in
a
flash
from
the
picture
which
he
was
examining
in
this
room
she
whispered
glancing
furtively
affrightedly
about
her
something
tells
aziz
when
he
is
near
and
i
too
feel
strangely
afraid
oh
can
it
be
that
he
is
not
dead
she
held
my
arm
tightly
her
brother
was
searching
the
room
with
big
velvet
black
eyes
i
studied
the
faces
of
the
several
visitors
and
smith
was
staring
about
him
with
the
old
alert
look
and
tugging
nervously
at
the
lobe
of
his
ear
the
name
of
the
giant
foe
of
the
white
race
instantaneously
had
strung
him
up
to
a
pitch
of
supreme
intensity
our
united
scrutinies
discovered
no
figure
which
could
have
been
that
of
the
chinese
doctor
who
could
mistake
that
long
gaunt
shape
with
the
high
shoulders
and
the
indescribable
gait
which
i
can
only
liken
to
that
of
an
awkward
cat
then
over
the
heads
of
a
group
of
people
who
stood
by
the
doorway
i
saw
smith
peering
at
someone
at
someone
who
passed
across
the
outer
room
stepping
aside
i
too
obtained
a
glimpse
of
this
person
as
i
saw
him
he
was
a
tall
old
man
wearing
a
black
inverness
coat
and
a
rather
shabby
silk
hat
he
had
long
white
hair
and
a
patriarchal
beard
wore
smoked
glasses
and
walked
slowly
leaning
upon
a
stick
smith
gaunt
face
paled
with
a
rapid
glance
at
karamaneh
he
made
off
across
the
room
could
it
be
many
days
had
passed
since
already
by
inspector
iron
grip
before
our
own
eyes
had
been
swallowed
up
by
the
thames
even
now
men
were
seeking
his
body
and
that
of
his
last
victim
nor
had
we
left
any
stone
unturned
acting
upon
information
furnished
by
karamaneh
the
police
had
searched
every
known
haunt
of
the
murder
group
but
everything
pointed
to
the
fact
that
the
group
was
disbanded
and
dispersed
that
the
lord
of
strange
deaths
who
had
ruled
it
was
no
more
yet
smith
was
not
satisfied
neither
let
me
confess
was
i
every
port
was
watched
and
in
suspected
districts
a
kind
of
patrol
had
been
instituted
unknown
to
the
great
public
in
those
days
a
secret
war
waged
a
war
in
which
all
the
available
forces
of
the
authorities
took
the
field
against
one
man
but
that
one
man
was
the
evil
of
the
east
incarnate
when
we
rejoined
him
nayland
smith
was
talking
to
the
commissionaire
at
the
door
he
turned
to
me
that
is
professor
jenner
monde
he
said
the
sergeant
here
knows
him
well
the
name
of
the
celebrated
orientalist
of
course
was
familiar
to
me
although
i
had
never
before
set
eyes
upon
him
the
professor
was
out
east
the
last
time
i
was
there
sir
stated
the
commissionaire
i
often
used
to
see
him
but
he
an
eccentric
old
gentleman
seems
to
live
in
a
world
of
his
own
he
recently
back
from
china
i
think
nayland
smith
stood
clicking
his
teeth
together
in
irritable
hesitation
i
heard
karamaneh
sigh
and
looking
at
her
i
saw
that
her
cheeks
were
regaining
their
natural
color
she
smiled
in
pathetic
apology
if
he
was
here
he
is
gone
she
said
i
am
not
afraid
now
smith
thanked
the
commissionaire
for
his
information
and
we
quitted
the
gallery
professor
jenner
monde
muttered
my
friend
has
lived
so
long
in
china
as
almost
to
be
a
chinaman
i
have
never
met
him
never
seen
him
before
but
i
wonder
you
wonder
what
smith
i
wonder
if
he
could
possibly
be
an
ally
of
the
doctor
i
stared
at
him
in
amazement
if
we
are
to
attach
any
importance
to
the
incident
at
all
i
said
we
must
remember
that
the
boy
impression
and
karamaneh
was
that
was
present
in
person
i
do
attach
importance
to
the
incident
petrie
they
are
naturally
sensitive
to
such
impressions
but
i
doubt
if
even
the
abnormal
organization
of
aziz
could
distinguish
between
the
hidden
presence
of
a
creature
of
the
doctor
and
that
of
the
doctor
himself
i
shall
make
a
point
of
calling
upon
professor
jenner
monde
but
fate
had
ordained
that
much
should
happen
ere
smith
made
his
proposed
call
upon
the
professor
karamaneh
and
her
brother
safely
lodged
in
their
hotel
which
was
watched
night
and
day
by
four
men
under
smith
orders
we
returned
to
my
quiet
suburban
rooms
first
said
smith
let
us
see
what
we
can
find
out
respecting
professor
monde
he
went
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
new
scotland
yard
there
followed
some
little
delay
before
the
requisite
information
was
obtained
finally
however
we
learned
that
the
professor
was
something
of
a
recluse
having
few
acquaintances
and
fewer
friends
he
lived
alone
in
chambers
in
new
inn
court
carey
street
a
charwoman
did
such
cleaning
as
was
considered
necessary
by
the
professor
who
employed
no
regular
domestic
when
he
was
in
london
he
might
be
seen
fairly
frequently
at
the
british
museum
where
his
shabby
figure
was
familiar
to
the
officials
when
he
was
not
in
london
that
is
during
the
greater
part
of
each
year
no
one
knew
where
he
went
he
never
left
any
address
to
which
letters
might
be
forwarded
how
long
has
he
been
in
london
now
asked
smith
so
far
as
could
be
ascertained
from
new
inn
court
replied
scotland
yard
roughly
a
week
my
friend
left
the
telephone
and
began
restlessly
to
pace
the
room
the
charred
briar
was
produced
and
stuffed
with
that
broad
cut
latakia
mixture
of
which
nayland
smith
consumed
close
upon
a
pound
a
week
he
was
one
of
those
untidy
smokers
who
leave
tangled
tufts
hanging
from
the
and
when
they
light
up
strew
the
floor
with
smoldering
fragments
a
ringing
came
and
shortly
afterwards
a
girl
entered
james
weymouth
to
see
you
sir
hullo
rapped
smith
what
this
weymouth
entered
big
and
florid
and
in
some
respects
singularly
like
his
brother
in
others
as
singularly
unlike
now
in
his
black
suit
he
was
a
somber
figure
and
in
the
blue
eyes
i
read
a
fear
suppressed
smith
he
began
there
something
uncanny
going
on
at
maple
cottage
smith
wheeled
the
big
forward
sit
down
weymouth
he
said
i
am
not
entirely
surprised
but
you
have
my
attention
what
has
occurred
weymouth
took
a
cigarette
from
the
box
which
i
proffered
and
poured
out
a
peg
of
whisky
his
hand
was
not
quite
steady
that
knocking
he
explained
it
came
again
the
night
after
you
were
there
and
weymouth
my
wife
i
mean
felt
that
she
could
spend
another
night
there
alone
did
she
look
out
of
the
window
i
asked
no
doctor
she
was
afraid
but
i
spent
last
night
downstairs
in
the
and
looked
out
he
took
a
gulp
from
his
glass
nayland
smith
seated
on
the
edge
of
the
table
his
extinguished
pipe
in
his
hand
was
watching
him
keenly
i
admit
i
did
look
out
at
once
weymouth
resumed
there
was
something
so
uncanny
gentlemen
in
that
knocking
knocking
in
the
dead
of
the
night
i
thought
his
voice
shook
of
poor
jack
lying
somewhere
amongst
the
slime
of
the
river
and
oh
my
god
it
came
to
me
that
it
was
jack
who
was
knocking
and
i
dare
not
think
what
he
what
it
would
look
like
he
leaned
forward
his
chin
in
his
hand
for
a
few
moments
we
were
all
silent
i
know
i
funked
he
continued
huskily
but
when
the
wife
came
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
whispered
to
me
it
is
again
what
in
heaven
name
can
it
be
i
started
to
unbolt
the
door
the
knocking
had
stopped
everything
was
very
still
i
heard
mary
his
widow
sobbing
upstairs
that
was
all
i
opened
the
door
a
little
bit
at
a
time
pausing
again
he
cleared
his
throat
and
went
on
it
was
a
bright
night
and
there
was
no
one
there
not
a
soul
but
somewhere
down
the
lane
as
i
looked
out
into
the
porch
i
heard
most
awful
groans
they
got
fainter
and
fainter
then
i
could
have
sworn
i
heard
someone
laughing
my
nerves
cracked
up
at
that
and
i
shut
the
door
again
the
narration
of
his
weird
experience
revived
something
of
the
natural
fear
which
it
had
occasioned
he
raised
his
glass
with
unsteady
hand
and
drained
it
smith
struck
a
match
and
relighted
his
pipe
he
began
to
pace
the
room
again
his
eyes
were
literally
on
fire
would
it
be
possible
to
get
weymouth
out
of
the
house
before
remove
her
to
your
place
for
instance
he
asked
abruptly
weymouth
looked
up
in
surprise
she
seems
to
be
in
a
very
low
state
he
replied
he
glanced
at
me
perhaps
petrie
would
give
us
an
opinion
i
will
come
and
see
her
i
said
but
what
is
your
idea
smith
i
want
to
hear
that
knocking
he
rapped
but
in
what
i
may
see
fit
to
do
i
must
not
be
handicapped
by
the
presence
of
a
sick
woman
her
condition
at
any
rate
will
admit
of
our
administering
an
opiate
i
suggested
that
would
meet
the
situation
good
cried
smith
he
was
intensely
excited
now
i
rely
upon
you
to
arrange
something
petrie
weymouth
he
turned
to
our
visitor
i
shall
be
with
you
this
evening
not
later
than
twelve
weymouth
appeared
to
be
greatly
relieved
i
asked
him
to
wait
whilst
i
prepared
a
draught
for
the
patient
when
he
was
gone
what
do
you
think
this
knocking
means
smith
i
asked
he
tapped
out
his
pipe
on
the
side
of
the
grate
and
began
with
nervous
energy
to
refill
it
again
from
the
dilapidated
pouch
i
dare
not
tell
you
what
i
hope
petrie
he
replied
nor
what
i
fear
chapter
xxix
dusk
was
falling
when
we
made
our
way
in
the
direction
of
maple
cottage
nayland
smith
appeared
to
be
keenly
interested
in
the
character
of
the
district
a
high
and
ancient
wall
bordered
the
road
along
which
we
walked
for
a
considerable
distance
later
it
gave
place
to
a
rickety
fence
my
friend
peered
through
a
gap
in
the
latter
there
is
quite
an
extensive
estate
here
he
said
not
yet
cut
up
by
the
builder
it
is
well
wooded
on
one
side
and
there
appears
to
be
a
pool
lower
down
the
road
was
a
quiet
one
and
we
plainly
heard
the
tread
quite
unmistakable
of
an
approaching
policeman
smith
continued
to
peer
through
the
hole
in
the
fence
until
the
officer
drew
up
level
with
us
then
does
this
piece
of
ground
extend
down
to
the
village
constable
he
inquired
quite
willing
for
a
chat
the
man
stopped
and
stood
with
his
thumbs
thrust
in
his
belt
yes
sir
they
tell
me
three
new
roads
will
be
made
through
it
between
here
and
the
hill
it
must
be
a
happy
hunting
ground
for
tramps
i
seen
some
coves
about
at
times
but
after
dusk
an
army
might
be
inside
there
and
nobody
would
ever
be
the
wiser
burglaries
frequent
in
the
houses
backing
on
to
it
oh
no
a
favorite
game
in
these
parts
is
snatching
loaves
and
bottles
of
milk
from
the
doors
first
thing
as
they
delivered
there
been
an
extra
lot
of
it
lately
my
mate
who
relieves
me
has
got
special
instructions
to
keep
his
eye
open
in
the
mornings
the
man
grinned
it
would
be
a
very
big
case
even
if
he
caught
anybody
no
said
smith
absently
perhaps
not
your
business
must
be
a
dry
one
this
warm
weather
sir
replied
the
constable
richer
by
and
thank
you
smith
stared
after
him
for
a
moment
tugging
reflectively
at
the
lobe
of
his
ear
i
do
know
that
it
would
be
a
big
case
after
all
he
murmured
come
on
petrie
not
another
word
did
he
speak
until
we
stood
at
the
gate
of
maple
cottage
there
a
man
was
standing
evidently
awaiting
smith
he
touched
his
hat
have
you
found
a
suitable
asked
my
companion
rapidly
yes
sir
was
the
reply
kent
my
mate
is
there
now
notice
that
he
ca
be
seen
from
here
no
agreed
smith
peering
all
about
him
he
ca
where
is
he
behind
the
broken
wall
explained
the
man
pointing
through
that
ivy
there
a
clear
view
of
the
cottage
door
good
keep
your
eyes
open
if
a
messenger
comes
for
me
he
is
to
be
intercepted
you
understand
no
one
must
be
allowed
to
disturb
us
you
will
recognize
the
messenger
he
will
be
one
of
your
fellows
should
he
come
hoot
three
times
as
much
like
an
owl
as
you
can
we
walked
up
to
the
porch
of
the
cottage
in
response
to
ringing
came
james
weymouth
who
seemed
greatly
relieved
by
our
arrival
first
said
my
friend
briskly
you
had
better
run
up
and
see
the
patient
accordingly
i
followed
weymouth
upstairs
and
was
admitted
by
his
wife
to
a
neat
little
bedroom
where
the
woman
lay
a
wanly
pathetic
sight
did
you
administer
the
draught
as
directed
i
asked
james
weymouth
nodded
she
was
a
kindly
looking
woman
with
the
same
dread
haunting
her
hazel
eyes
as
that
which
lurked
in
her
husband
blue
ones
the
patient
was
sleeping
soundly
some
whispered
instructions
i
gave
to
the
faithful
nurse
and
descended
to
the
it
was
a
warm
night
and
weymouth
sat
by
the
open
window
smoking
the
dim
light
from
the
lamp
on
the
table
lent
him
an
almost
startling
likeness
to
his
brother
and
for
a
moment
i
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
scarce
able
to
trust
my
reason
then
he
turned
his
face
fully
towards
me
and
the
illusion
was
lost
do
you
think
she
is
likely
to
wake
doctor
he
asked
i
think
not
i
replied
nayland
smith
stood
upon
the
rug
before
the
hearth
swinging
from
one
foot
to
the
other
in
his
nervously
restless
way
the
room
was
foggy
with
the
fumes
of
tobacco
for
he
too
was
smoking
at
intervals
of
some
five
to
ten
minutes
his
blackened
briar
which
i
never
knew
him
to
clean
or
scrape
would
go
out
i
think
smith
used
more
matches
than
any
other
smoker
i
have
ever
met
and
he
invariably
carried
three
boxes
in
various
pockets
of
his
garments
the
tobacco
habit
is
infectious
and
seating
myself
in
an
i
lighted
a
cigarette
for
this
dreary
vigil
i
had
come
prepared
with
a
bunch
of
rough
notes
a
and
a
fountain
pen
i
settled
down
to
work
upon
my
record
of
the
case
silence
fell
upon
maple
cottage
save
for
the
shuddering
sigh
which
whispered
through
the
cedars
and
smith
eternal
nothing
was
there
to
disturb
me
in
my
task
yet
i
could
make
little
progress
between
my
mind
and
the
chapter
upon
which
i
was
at
work
a
certain
sentence
persistently
intruded
itself
it
was
as
though
an
unseen
hand
held
the
written
page
closely
before
my
eyes
this
was
the
sentence
imagine
a
person
tall
lean
and
feline
with
a
brow
like
shakespeare
and
a
face
like
satan
a
skull
and
long
magnetic
eyes
of
the
true
invest
him
with
all
the
cruel
cunning
of
an
entire
eastern
race
accumulated
in
one
giant
intellect
as
smith
had
described
him
to
me
on
that
night
which
now
seemed
so
remotely
distant
the
night
upon
which
i
had
learned
of
the
existence
of
the
wonderful
and
evil
being
born
of
that
secret
quickening
which
stirred
in
the
womb
of
the
yellow
races
as
smith
for
the
ninth
or
tenth
time
knocked
out
his
pipe
on
a
bar
of
the
grate
the
cuckoo
clock
in
the
kitchen
proclaimed
the
hour
two
said
james
weymouth
i
abandoned
my
task
replacing
notes
and
in
the
bag
that
i
had
with
me
weymouth
adjusted
the
lamp
which
had
begun
to
smoke
i
tiptoed
to
the
stairs
and
stepping
softly
ascended
to
the
sick
room
all
was
quiet
and
weymouth
whispered
to
me
that
the
patient
still
slept
soundly
i
returned
to
find
nayland
smith
pacing
about
the
room
in
that
state
of
suppressed
excitement
habitual
with
him
in
the
approach
of
any
crisis
at
a
quarter
past
two
the
breeze
dropped
entirely
and
such
a
stillness
reigned
all
about
us
as
i
could
not
have
supposed
possible
so
near
to
the
heart
of
the
great
metropolis
plainly
i
could
hear
weymouth
heavy
breathing
he
sat
at
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
black
shadows
under
the
cedars
smith
ceased
his
pacing
and
stood
again
on
the
rug
very
still
he
was
listening
i
doubt
not
we
were
all
listening
some
faint
sound
broke
the
impressive
stillness
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
village
street
it
was
a
vague
indefinite
disturbance
brief
and
upon
it
ensued
a
silence
more
marked
than
ever
some
minutes
before
smith
had
extinguished
the
lamp
in
the
darkness
i
heard
his
teeth
snap
sharply
together
the
call
of
an
owl
sounded
very
clearly
three
times
i
knew
that
to
mean
that
a
messenger
had
come
but
from
whence
or
bearing
what
tidings
i
knew
not
my
friend
plans
were
incomprehensible
to
me
nor
had
i
pressed
him
for
any
explanation
of
their
nature
knowing
him
to
be
in
that
and
somewhat
irritable
mood
which
claimed
him
at
times
of
uncertainty
when
he
doubted
the
wisdom
of
his
actions
the
accuracy
of
his
surmises
he
gave
no
sign
very
faintly
i
heard
a
clock
strike
the
a
soft
breeze
stole
again
through
the
branches
above
the
wind
i
thought
must
be
in
a
new
quarter
since
i
had
not
heard
the
clock
before
in
so
lonely
a
spot
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
the
bell
was
that
of
paul
yet
such
was
the
fact
and
hard
upon
the
ringing
followed
another
sound
a
sound
we
all
had
expected
had
waited
for
but
at
whose
coming
no
one
of
us
i
think
retained
complete
mastery
of
himself
breaking
up
the
silence
in
a
manner
that
set
my
heart
wildly
leaping
it
came
an
imperative
knocking
on
the
door
my
god
groaned
weymouth
but
he
did
not
move
from
his
position
at
the
window
stand
by
petrie
said
smith
he
strode
to
the
door
and
threw
it
widely
open
i
know
i
was
very
pale
i
think
i
cried
out
as
i
fell
back
retreated
with
clenched
hands
from
before
that
which
stood
on
the
threshold
it
was
a
wild
unkempt
figure
with
straggling
beard
hideously
staring
eyes
with
its
hands
it
clutched
at
its
hair
at
its
chin
plucked
at
its
mouth
no
moonlight
touched
the
features
of
this
unearthly
visitant
but
scanty
as
was
the
illumination
we
could
see
the
gleaming
teeth
and
the
wildly
glaring
eyes
it
began
to
laugh
peal
after
peal
hideous
and
shrill
nothing
so
terrifying
had
ever
smote
upon
my
ears
i
was
palsied
by
the
horror
of
the
sound
then
nayland
smith
pressed
the
button
of
an
electric
torch
which
he
carried
he
directed
the
disk
of
white
light
fully
upon
the
face
in
the
doorway
oh
god
cried
weymouth
it
john
and
again
and
again
oh
god
oh
god
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
really
believed
nay
i
could
not
doubt
that
a
thing
of
another
world
stood
before
me
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
the
extent
of
the
horror
that
came
upon
me
james
weymouth
raised
his
hands
as
if
to
thrust
away
from
him
that
awful
thing
in
the
door
he
was
babbling
prayers
i
think
but
wholly
incoherent
hold
him
petrie
smith
voice
was
low
when
we
were
past
thought
or
intelligent
action
he
dominant
and
cool
with
that
forced
calm
for
which
a
crisis
over
he
always
paid
so
dearly
was
thinking
of
the
woman
who
slept
above
he
leaped
forward
and
in
the
instant
that
he
grappled
with
the
one
who
had
knocked
i
knew
the
visitant
for
a
man
of
flesh
and
blood
a
man
who
shrieked
and
fought
like
a
savage
animal
foamed
at
the
mouth
and
gnashed
his
teeth
in
horrid
frenzy
knew
him
for
a
madman
knew
him
for
the
victim
of
not
dead
but
living
for
inspector
weymouth
a
maniac
in
a
flash
i
realized
all
this
and
sprang
to
smith
assistance
there
was
a
sound
of
racing
footsteps
and
the
men
who
had
been
watching
outside
came
running
into
the
porch
a
third
was
with
them
and
the
five
of
us
for
weymouth
brother
had
not
yet
grasped
the
fact
that
a
man
and
not
a
spirit
shrieked
and
howled
in
our
midst
clung
to
the
infuriated
madman
yet
barely
held
our
own
with
him
the
syringe
petrie
gasped
smith
quick
you
must
manage
to
make
an
injection
i
extricated
myself
and
raced
into
the
cottage
for
my
bag
a
hypodermic
syringe
ready
charged
i
had
brought
with
me
at
request
even
in
that
thrilling
moment
i
could
find
time
to
admire
the
wonderful
foresight
of
my
friend
who
had
divined
what
would
befall
isolated
the
strange
pitiful
truth
from
the
chaotic
circumstances
which
saw
us
at
maple
cottage
that
night
let
me
not
enlarge
upon
the
end
of
the
awful
struggle
at
one
time
i
despaired
we
all
despaired
of
quieting
the
poor
demented
creature
but
at
last
it
was
done
and
the
gaunt
savage
whom
we
had
known
as
weymouth
lay
passive
upon
the
couch
in
his
own
a
great
wonder
possessed
my
mind
for
the
genius
of
the
uncanny
being
who
with
the
scratch
of
a
needle
had
made
a
brave
and
kindly
man
into
this
unclean
brutish
thing
nayland
smith
gaunt
and
and
trembling
yet
with
his
tremendous
exertions
turned
to
the
man
whom
i
knew
to
be
the
messenger
from
scotland
yard
well
he
rapped
he
is
arrested
sir
the
detective
reported
they
have
kept
him
at
his
chambers
as
you
ordered
has
she
slept
through
it
said
smith
to
me
i
had
just
returned
from
a
visit
to
the
room
above
i
nodded
is
he
safe
for
an
hour
or
two
indicating
the
figure
on
the
couch
for
eight
or
ten
i
replied
grimly
come
then
our
night
labors
are
not
nearly
complete
chapter
xxx
later
was
forthcoming
evidence
to
show
that
poor
weymouth
had
lived
a
wild
life
in
hiding
among
the
thick
bushes
of
the
tract
of
land
which
lay
between
the
village
and
the
suburb
on
the
neighboring
hill
literally
he
had
returned
to
primitive
savagery
and
some
of
his
food
had
been
that
of
the
lower
animals
though
he
had
not
scrupled
to
steal
as
we
learned
when
his
lair
was
discovered
he
had
hidden
himself
cunningly
but
witnesses
appeared
who
had
seen
him
in
the
dusk
and
fled
from
him
they
never
learned
that
the
object
of
their
fear
was
inspector
john
weymouth
how
having
escaped
death
in
the
thames
he
had
crossed
london
unobserved
we
never
knew
but
his
trick
of
knocking
upon
his
own
door
at
two
each
morning
a
sort
of
dawning
of
sanity
mysteriously
linked
with
old
custom
will
be
a
familiar
class
of
symptom
to
all
students
of
alienation
i
revert
to
the
night
when
smith
solved
the
mystery
of
the
knocking
in
a
car
which
he
had
in
waiting
at
the
end
of
the
village
we
sped
through
the
deserted
streets
to
new
inn
court
i
who
had
followed
nayland
smith
through
the
failures
and
successes
of
his
mission
knew
that
he
had
surpassed
himself
had
justified
the
confidence
placed
in
him
by
the
highest
authorities
we
were
admitted
to
an
untidy
room
that
of
a
student
a
traveler
and
a
crank
by
a
officer
amid
picturesque
and
disordered
fragments
of
a
hundred
ages
in
a
great
carven
chair
placed
before
a
towering
statue
of
the
buddha
sat
a
man
his
white
hair
and
beard
were
patriarchal
his
pose
had
great
dignity
but
his
expression
was
entirely
masked
by
the
smoked
glasses
which
he
wore
two
other
detectives
were
guarding
the
prisoner
we
arrested
professor
jenner
monde
as
he
came
in
sir
reported
the
man
who
had
opened
the
door
he
has
made
no
statement
i
hope
there
is
a
mistake
i
hope
not
rapped
smith
he
strode
across
the
room
he
was
consumed
by
a
fever
of
excitement
almost
savagely
he
tore
away
the
beard
tore
off
the
snowy
wig
dashed
the
smoked
glasses
upon
the
floor
a
great
high
brow
was
revealed
and
green
malignant
eyes
which
fixed
themselves
upon
him
with
an
expression
i
never
can
forget
it
was
one
intense
moment
of
silence
ensued
of
silence
which
seemed
to
throb
then
what
have
you
done
with
professor
monde
demanded
smith
showed
his
even
yellow
teeth
in
the
singularly
evil
smile
which
i
knew
so
well
a
manacled
prisoner
he
sat
as
unruffled
as
a
judge
upon
the
bench
in
truth
and
in
justice
i
am
compelled
to
say
that
was
absolutely
fearless
he
has
been
detained
in
china
he
replied
in
smooth
sibilant
tones
by
affairs
of
great
urgency
his
personality
and
ungregarious
habits
have
served
me
well
here
smith
i
could
see
was
undetermined
how
to
act
he
stood
tugging
at
his
ear
and
glancing
from
the
impassive
chinaman
to
the
wondering
detectives
what
are
we
to
do
sir
one
of
them
asked
leave
petrie
and
myself
alone
with
the
prisoner
until
i
call
you
the
three
withdrew
i
divined
now
what
was
coming
can
you
restore
weymouth
sanity
rapped
smith
abruptly
i
can
not
save
you
from
the
hangman
nor
his
fists
clenched
convulsively
would
i
if
i
could
but
fixed
his
brilliant
eyes
upon
him
say
no
more
smith
he
interrupted
you
misunderstand
me
i
do
not
quarrel
with
that
but
what
i
have
done
from
conviction
and
what
i
have
done
of
necessity
are
separated
are
seas
apart
the
brave
inspector
weymouth
i
wounded
with
a
poisoned
needle
in
but
i
regret
his
condition
as
greatly
as
you
do
i
respect
such
a
man
there
is
an
antidote
to
the
poison
of
the
needle
name
it
said
smith
smiled
again
useless
he
replied
i
alone
can
prepare
it
my
secrets
shall
die
with
me
i
will
make
a
sane
man
of
inspector
weymouth
but
no
one
else
shall
be
in
the
house
but
he
and
i
it
will
be
surrounded
by
police
interrupted
smith
grimly
as
you
please
said
make
your
arrangements
in
that
ebony
case
upon
the
table
are
the
instruments
for
the
cure
arrange
for
me
to
visit
him
where
and
when
you
will
i
distrust
you
utterly
it
is
some
trick
jerked
smith
rose
slowly
and
drew
himself
up
to
his
great
height
his
manacled
hands
could
not
rob
him
of
the
uncanny
dignity
which
was
his
he
raised
them
above
his
head
with
a
tragic
gesture
and
fixed
his
piercing
gaze
upon
nayland
smith
the
god
of
cathay
hear
me
he
said
with
a
deep
guttural
note
in
his
voice
i
swear
the
most
awful
visitor
who
ever
threatened
the
peace
of
england
the
end
of
the
visit
of
was
characteristic
terrible
inexplicable
strange
to
relate
i
did
not
doubt
that
this
weird
being
had
conceived
some
kind
of
admiration
or
respect
for
the
man
to
whom
he
had
wrought
so
terrible
an
injury
he
was
capable
of
such
sentiments
for
he
entertained
some
similar
one
in
regard
to
myself
a
cottage
farther
down
the
village
street
than
weymouth
was
vacant
and
in
the
early
dawn
of
that
morning
became
the
scene
of
outre
happenings
poor
weymouth
still
in
a
comatose
condition
we
removed
there
smith
having
secured
the
key
from
the
astonished
agent
i
suppose
so
strange
a
specialist
never
visited
a
patient
before
certainly
not
under
such
conditions
for
into
the
cottage
which
had
been
entirely
surrounded
by
a
ring
of
police
was
admitted
from
the
closed
car
in
which
his
work
of
healing
complete
he
was
to
be
borne
to
prison
to
death
law
and
justice
were
suspended
by
my
royally
empowered
friend
that
the
enemy
of
the
white
race
might
heal
one
of
those
who
had
hunted
him
down
no
curious
audience
was
present
for
sunrise
was
not
yet
come
no
concourse
of
excited
students
followed
the
hand
of
the
master
but
within
that
surrounded
cottage
was
performed
one
of
those
miracles
of
science
which
in
other
circumstances
had
made
the
fame
of
to
live
forever
inspector
weymouth
dazed
disheveled
clutching
his
head
as
a
man
who
has
passed
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
but
sane
sane
walked
out
into
the
porch
he
looked
towards
us
his
eyes
wild
but
not
with
the
fearsome
wildness
of
insanity
mr
smith
he
cried
and
staggered
down
the
path
petrie
what
there
came
a
deafening
explosion
from
every
visible
window
of
the
deserted
cottage
flames
burst
forth
quick
smith
voice
rose
almost
to
a
scream
into
the
house
he
raced
up
the
path
past
inspector
weymouth
who
stood
swaying
there
like
a
drunken
man
i
was
close
upon
his
heels
behind
me
came
the
police
the
door
was
impassable
already
it
vomited
a
deathly
heat
borne
upon
stifling
fumes
like
those
of
the
mouth
of
the
pit
we
burst
a
window
the
room
within
was
a
furnace
my
god
cried
someone
this
is
supernatural
listen
cried
another
listen
the
crowd
which
a
fire
can
conjure
up
at
any
hour
of
day
or
night
out
of
the
void
of
nowhere
was
gathering
already
but
upon
all
descended
a
pall
of
silence
from
the
heat
of
the
holocaust
a
voice
proclaimed
itself
a
voice
raised
not
in
anguish
but
in
triumph
it
chanted
barbarically
and
was
still
the
abnormal
flames
rose
higher
leaping
forth
from
every
window
the
alarm
said
smith
hoarsely
call
up
the
brigade
i
come
to
the
close
of
my
chronicle
and
feel
that
i
betray
a
trust
the
trust
of
my
reader
for
having
limned
in
the
colors
at
my
command
the
fiendish
chinese
doctor
i
am
unable
to
conclude
my
task
as
i
should
desire
unable
with
any
consciousness
of
finality
to
write
finis
to
the
end
of
my
narrative
it
seems
to
me
sometimes
that
my
pen
is
but
temporarily
idle
that
i
have
but
dealt
with
a
single
phase
of
a
movement
having
a
hundred
phases
one
sequel
i
hope
for
and
against
all
the
promptings
of
logic
and
western
bias
if
my
hope
shall
be
realized
i
can
not
at
this
time
pretend
to
state
the
future
its
many
secrets
holds
this
precious
one
from
me
i
ask
you
then
to
absolve
me
from
the
charge
of
ill
completing
my
work
for
any
curiosity
with
which
this
narrative
may
leave
the
reader
burdened
is
shared
by
the
writer
with
intent
i
have
rushed
you
from
the
chambers
of
professor
jenner
monde
to
that
closing
episode
at
the
deserted
cottage
i
have
made
the
pace
hot
in
order
to
impart
to
these
last
pages
of
my
account
something
of
the
breathless
scurry
which
characterized
those
happenings
my
canvas
may
seem
sketchy
it
is
my
impression
of
the
reality
no
hard
details
remain
in
my
mind
of
the
dealings
of
that
night
arrested
manacled
entering
the
cottage
on
his
mission
of
healing
weymouth
miraculously
rendered
sane
coming
forth
the
place
in
flames
and
then
to
a
shell
the
cottage
burned
with
an
incredible
rapidity
which
pointed
to
some
hidden
agency
to
a
shell
about
ashes
which
held
no
trace
of
human
bones
it
has
been
asked
of
me
was
there
no
possibility
of
having
eluded
us
in
the
ensuing
confusion
was
there
no
loophole
of
escape
i
reply
that
so
far
as
i
was
able
to
judge
a
rat
could
scarce
have
quitted
the
building
undetected
yet
that
had
in
some
incomprehensible
manner
and
by
some
mysterious
agency
produced
those
abnormal
flames
i
can
not
doubt
did
he
voluntarily
ignite
his
own
funeral
pyre
as
i
write
there
lies
before
me
a
soiled
and
creased
sheet
of
vellum
it
bears
some
lines
traced
in
a
cramped
peculiar
and
all
but
illegible
hand
this
fragment
was
found
by
inspector
weymouth
to
this
day
a
man
mentally
sound
in
a
pocket
of
his
ragged
garments
when
it
was
written
i
leave
you
to
judge
how
it
came
to
be
where
weymouth
found
it
calls
for
no
explanation
to
commissioner
nayland
smith
and
petrie
greeting
i
am
recalled
home
by
one
who
may
not
be
denied
in
much
that
i
came
to
do
i
have
failed
much
that
i
have
done
i
would
undo
some
little
i
have
undone
out
of
fire
i
came
the
smoldering
fire
of
a
thing
one
day
to
be
a
consuming
flame
in
fire
i
go
seek
not
my
ashes
i
am
the
lord
of
the
fires
farewell
who
has
been
with
me
in
my
several
meetings
with
the
man
who
penned
that
message
i
leave
to
adjudge
if
it
be
the
letter
of
a
madman
bent
upon
by
strange
means
or
the
gibe
of
a
preternaturally
clever
scientist
and
the
most
elusive
being
ever
born
of
the
land
of
mystery
china
for
the
present
i
can
aid
you
no
more
in
the
forming
of
your
verdict
a
day
may
come
though
i
pray
it
do
not
when
i
shall
be
able
to
throw
new
light
upon
much
that
is
dark
in
this
matter
that
day
so
far
as
i
can
judge
could
only
dawn
in
the
event
of
the
chinaman
survival
therefore
i
pray
that
the
veil
be
never
lifted
but
as
i
have
said
there
is
another
sequel
to
this
story
which
i
can
contemplate
with
a
different
countenance
how
then
shall
i
conclude
this
very
unsatisfactory
account
shall
i
tell
you
finally
of
my
parting
with
lovely
karamaneh
on
board
the
liner
which
was
to
bear
her
to
egypt
no
let
me
instead
conclude
with
the
words
of
nayland
smith
sail
for
burma
in
a
fortnight
petrie
i
have
leave
to
break
my
journey
at
the
ditch
how
would
a
run
up
the
nile
fit
your
programme
bit
early
for
the
season
but
you
might
find
something
to
amuse
you
