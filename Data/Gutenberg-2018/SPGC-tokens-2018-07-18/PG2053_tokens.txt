political

preface
in
the
volume
which
with
much
diffidence
is
here
offered
to
the
public
i
have
given
as
far
as
i
have
considered
it
worth
giving
my
whole
thought
in
a
connected
form
on
the
nature
necessity
extent
authority
origin
ground
and
constitution
of
government
and
the
unity
nationality
constitution
tendencies
and
destiny
of
the
american
republic
many
of
the
points
treated
have
been
from
time
to
time
discussed
or
touched
upon
and
many
of
the
views
have
been
presented
in
my
previous
writings
but
this
work
is
newly
and
independently
written
from
beginning
to
end
and
is
as
complete
on
the
topics
treated
as
i
have
been
able
to
make
it
i
have
taken
nothing
bodily
from
my
previous
essays
but
i
have
used
their
thoughts
as
far
as
i
have
judged
them
sound
and
they
came
within
the
scope
of
my
present
work
i
have
not
felt
myself
bound
to
adhere
to
my
own
past
thoughts
or
expressions
any
farther
than
they
coincide
with
my
present
convictions
and
i
have
written
as
freely
and
as
independently
as
if
i
had
never
written
or
published
any
thing
before
i
have
never
been
the
slave
of
my
own
past
and
truth
has
always
been
dearer
to
me
than
my
own
opinions
this
work
is
not
only
my
latest
but
will
be
my
last
on
politics
or
government
and
must
be
taken
as
the
authentic
and
the
only
authentic
statement
of
my
political
views
and
convictions
and
whatever
in
any
of
my
previous
writings
conflicts
with
the
principles
defended
in
its
pages
must
be
regarded
as
retracted
and
rejected
the
work
now
produced
is
based
on
scientific
principles
but
it
is
an
essay
rather
than
a
scientific
treatise
and
even
critics
will
no
doubt
pronounce
it
an
article
or
a
series
of
articles
designed
for
a
review
rather
than
a
book
it
is
hard
to
overcome
the
habits
of
a
lifetime
i
have
taken
some
pains
to
exchange
the
reviewer
for
the
author
but
am
fully
conscious
that
i
have
not
succeeded
my
work
can
lay
claim
to
very
little
artistic
merit
it
is
full
of
repetitions
the
same
thought
is
frequently
recurring
the
result
to
some
extent
no
doubt
of
carelessness
and
the
want
of
artistic
skill
but
to
a
greater
extent
i
fear
of
malice
aforethought
in
composing
my
work
i
have
followed
rather
than
directed
the
course
of
my
thought
and
having
very
little
confidence
in
the
memory
or
industry
of
readers
i
have
preferred
when
the
completeness
of
the
argument
required
it
to
repeat
myself
to
encumbering
my
pages
with
perpetual
references
to
what
has
gone
before
that
i
attach
some
value
to
this
work
is
evident
from
my
consenting
to
its
publication
but
how
much
or
how
little
of
it
is
really
mine
i
am
quite
unable
to
say
i
have
from
my
youth
up
been
reading
observing
thinking
reflecting
talking
i
had
almost
said
writing
at
least
by
fits
and
starts
on
political
subjects
especially
in
their
connection
with
philosophy
theology
history
and
social
progress
and
have
assimilated
to
my
own
mind
what
it
would
assimilate
without
keeping
any
notes
of
the
sources
whence
the
materials
assimilated
were
derived
i
have
written
freely
from
my
own
mind
as
i
find
it
now
formed
but
how
it
has
been
so
formed
or
whence
i
have
borrowed
my
readers
know
as
well
as
i
all
that
is
valuable
in
the
thoughts
set
forth
it
is
safe
to
assume
has
been
appropriated
from
others
where
i
have
been
distinctly
conscious
of
borrowing
what
has
not
become
common
property
i
have
given
credit
or
at
least
mentioned
the
name
with
three
important
exceptions
which
i
wish
to
note
more
formally
i
am
principally
indebted
for
the
view
of
the
american
nationality
and
the
federal
constitution
i
present
to
hints
and
suggestions
furnished
by
the
remarkable
work
of
john
hurd
on
the
law
of
freedom
and
bondage
in
the
united
states
a
work
of
rare
learning
and
profound
philosophic
views
i
could
not
have
written
my
work
without
the
aid
derived
from
its
suggestions
any
more
than
i
could
without
plato
aristotle
augustine
thomas
suarez
pierre
leroux
and
the
abbate
gioberti
to
these
two
authors
one
a
humanitarian
sophist
the
other
a
catholic
priest
and
certainly
one
of
the
profoundest
philosophical
writers
of
this
century
i
am
much
indebted
though
i
have
followed
the
political
system
of
neither
i
have
taken
from
leroux
the
germs
of
the
doctrine
i
set
forth
on
the
solidarity
of
the
race
and
from
gioberti
the
doctrine
i
defend
in
relation
to
the
creative
act
which
is
after
all
simply
that
of
the
credo
and
the
first
verse
of
genesis
in
treating
the
several
questions
which
the
preparation
of
this
volume
has
brought
up
in
their
connection
and
in
the
light
of
first
principles
i
have
changed
or
modified
on
more
than
one
important
point
the
views
i
had
expressed
in
my
previous
writings
especially
on
the
distinction
between
civilized
and
barbaric
nations
the
real
basis
of
civilization
itself
and
the
value
to
the
world
of
the
civilization
i
have
ranked
feudalism
under
the
head
of
barbarism
rejected
every
species
of
political
aristocracy
and
represented
the
english
constitution
as
essentially
antagonistic
to
the
american
not
as
its
type
i
have
accepted
universal
suffrage
in
principle
and
defended
american
democracy
which
i
define
to
be
territorial
democracy
and
carefully
distinguish
from
pure
individualism
on
the
one
hand
and
from
pure
socialism
or
humanitarianism
on
the
other
i
reject
the
doctrine
of
state
sovereignty
which
i
held
and
defended
from
to
but
still
maintain
that
the
sovereignty
of
the
american
republic
vests
in
the
states
though
in
the
states
collectively
or
united
not
severally
and
thus
escape
alike
consolidation
and
disintegration
i
find
with
madison
our
most
philosophic
statesman
the
originality
of
the
american
system
in
the
division
of
powers
between
a
general
government
having
sole
charge
of
the
foreign
and
general
and
particular
or
state
governments
having
within
their
respective
territories
sole
charge
of
the
particular
relations
and
interests
of
the
american
people
but
i
do
not
accept
his
concession
that
this
division
is
of
conventional
origin
and
maintain
that
it
enters
into
the
original
providential
constitution
of
the
american
state
as
i
have
done
in
my
review
for
october
and
january
and
october
i
maintain
after
mr
senator
sumner
one
of
the
most
philosophic
and
accomplished
living
american
statesmen
that
state
secession
is
state
suicide
but
modify
the
opinion
i
too
hastily
expressed
that
the
political
death
of
a
state
dissolves
civil
society
within
its
territory
and
abrogates
all
rights
held
under
it
and
accept
the
doctrine
that
the
laws
in
force
at
the
time
of
secession
remain
in
force
till
superseded
or
abrogated
by
competent
authority
and
also
that
till
the
state
is
revived
and
restored
as
a
state
in
the
union
the
only
authority
under
the
american
system
competent
to
supersede
or
abrogate
them
is
the
united
states
not
congress
far
less
the
executive
the
error
of
the
government
is
not
in
recognizing
the
territorial
laws
as
surviving
secession
but
in
counting
a
state
that
has
seceded
as
still
a
state
in
the
union
with
the
right
to
be
counted
as
one
of
the
united
states
in
amending
the
constitution
such
state
goes
out
of
the
union
but
comes
under
it
i
have
endeavored
throughout
to
refer
my
particular
political
views
to
their
general
principles
and
to
show
that
the
general
principles
asserted
have
their
origin
and
ground
in
the
great
universal
and
unchanging
principles
of
the
universe
itself
hence
i
have
labored
to
show
the
scientific
relations
of
political
to
theological
principles
the
real
principles
of
all
science
as
of
all
reality
an
atheist
i
have
said
may
be
a
politician
but
if
there
were
no
god
there
could
be
no
politics
this
may
offend
the
sciolists
of
the
age
but
i
must
follow
science
where
it
leads
and
can
not
be
arrested
by
those
who
mistake
their
darkness
for
light
i
write
throughout
as
a
christian
because
i
am
a
christian
as
a
catholic
because
all
christian
principles
nay
all
real
principles
are
catholic
and
there
is
nothing
sectarian
either
in
nature
or
revelation
i
am
a
catholic
by
god
grace
and
great
goodness
and
must
write
as
i
am
i
could
not
write
otherwise
if
i
would
and
would
not
if
i
could
i
have
not
obtruded
my
religion
and
have
referred
to
it
only
where
my
argument
demanded
it
but
i
have
had
neither
the
weakness
nor
the
bad
taste
to
seek
to
conceal
or
disguise
it
i
could
never
have
written
my
book
without
the
knowledge
i
have
as
a
catholic
of
catholic
theology
and
my
acquaintance
slight
as
it
is
with
the
great
fathers
and
doctors
of
the
church
the
great
masters
of
all
that
is
solid
or
permanent
in
modern
thought
either
with
catholics
or
moreover
though
i
write
for
all
americans
without
distinction
of
sect
or
party
i
have
had
more
especially
in
view
the
people
of
my
own
religious
communion
it
is
no
discredit
to
a
man
in
the
united
states
at
the
present
day
to
be
a
firm
sincere
and
devout
catholic
the
old
sectarian
prejudice
may
remain
with
a
few
whose
eyes
as
emerson
says
are
in
their
not
in
their
but
the
american
people
are
not
at
heart
sectarian
and
the
nothingarianism
so
prevalent
among
them
only
marks
their
state
of
transition
from
sectarian
opinions
to
positive
catholic
faith
at
any
rate
it
can
no
longer
be
denied
that
catholics
are
an
integral
living
and
growing
element
in
the
american
population
quite
too
numerous
too
wealthy
and
too
influential
to
be
ignored
they
have
played
too
conspicuous
a
part
in
the
late
troubles
of
the
country
and
poured
out
too
freely
and
too
much
of
their
richest
and
noblest
blood
in
defence
of
the
unity
of
the
nation
and
the
integrity
of
its
domain
for
that
catholics
henceforth
must
be
treated
as
standing
in
all
respects
on
a
footing
of
equality
with
any
other
class
of
american
citizens
and
their
views
of
political
science
or
of
any
other
science
be
counted
of
equal
importance
and
listened
to
with
equal
attention
i
have
no
fears
that
my
book
will
be
neglected
because
avowedly
by
a
catholic
author
and
from
a
catholic
publishing
house
they
who
are
not
catholics
will
read
it
and
it
will
enter
into
the
current
of
american
literature
if
it
is
one
they
must
read
in
order
to
be
up
with
the
living
and
growing
thought
of
the
age
if
it
is
not
a
book
of
that
sort
it
is
not
worth
reading
by
any
one
furthermore
i
am
ambitious
even
in
my
old
age
and
i
wish
to
exert
an
influence
on
the
future
of
my
country
for
which
i
have
made
or
rather
my
family
have
made
some
sacrifices
and
which
i
tenderly
love
now
i
believe
that
he
who
can
exert
the
most
influence
on
our
catholic
population
especially
in
giving
tone
and
direction
to
our
catholic
youth
will
exert
the
most
influence
in
forming
the
character
and
shaping
the
future
destiny
of
the
american
republic
ambition
and
patriotism
alike
as
well
as
my
own
catholic
faith
and
sympathies
induce
me
to
address
myself
primarily
to
catholics
i
quarrel
with
none
of
the
sects
i
honor
virtue
wherever
i
see
it
and
accept
truth
wherever
i
find
it
but
in
my
belief
no
sect
is
destined
to
a
long
life
or
a
permanent
possession
i
engage
in
no
controversy
with
any
one
not
of
my
religion
for
if
the
positive
affirmative
truth
is
brought
out
and
placed
in
a
clear
light
before
the
public
whatever
is
sectarian
in
any
of
the
sects
will
disappear
as
the
morning
mists
before
the
rising
sun
i
expect
the
most
intelligent
and
satisfactory
appreciation
of
my
book
from
the
thinking
and
educated
classes
among
catholics
but
i
speak
to
my
countrymen
at
large
i
could
not
personally
serve
my
country
in
the
field
my
habits
as
well
as
my
infirmities
prevented
to
say
nothing
of
my
age
but
i
have
endeavored
in
this
humble
work
to
add
my
contribution
small
though
it
may
be
to
political
science
and
to
discharge
as
far
as
i
am
able
my
debt
of
loyalty
and
patriotism
i
would
the
book
were
more
of
a
book
more
worthy
of
my
countrymen
and
a
more
weighty
proof
of
the
love
i
beat
them
and
with
which
i
have
written
it
all
i
can
say
is
that
it
is
an
honest
book
a
sincere
book
and
contains
my
best
thoughts
on
the
subjects
treated
if
well
received
i
shall
be
grateful
if
neglected
i
shall
endeavor
to
practise
resignation
as
i
have
so
often
done
o
brownson
elizabeth
september
chapter
i
introduction
the
ancients
summed
up
the
whole
of
human
wisdom
in
the
maxim
know
thyself
and
certainly
there
is
for
an
individual
no
more
important
as
there
is
no
more
difficult
knowledge
than
knowledge
of
himself
whence
he
comes
whither
he
goes
what
he
is
what
he
is
for
what
he
can
do
what
he
ought
to
do
and
what
are
his
means
of
doing
it
nations
are
only
individuals
on
a
larger
scale
they
have
a
life
an
individuality
a
reason
a
conscience
and
instincts
of
their
own
and
have
the
same
general
laws
of
development
and
growth
and
perhaps
of
decay
as
the
individual
man
equally
important
and
no
less
difficult
than
for
the
individual
is
it
for
a
nation
to
know
itself
understand
its
own
existence
its
own
powers
and
faculties
rights
and
duties
constitution
instincts
tendencies
and
destiny
a
nation
has
a
spiritual
as
well
as
a
material
a
moral
as
well
as
a
physical
existence
and
is
subjected
to
internal
as
well
as
external
conditions
of
health
and
virtue
greatness
and
grandeur
which
it
must
in
some
measure
understand
and
observe
or
become
weak
and
infirm
stunted
in
its
growth
and
end
in
premature
decay
and
death
among
nations
no
one
has
more
need
of
full
knowledge
of
itself
than
the
united
states
and
no
one
has
hitherto
had
less
it
has
hardly
had
a
distinct
consciousness
of
its
own
national
existence
and
has
lived
the
irreflective
life
of
the
child
with
no
severe
trial
till
the
recent
rebellion
to
throw
it
back
on
itself
and
compel
it
to
reflect
on
its
own
constitution
its
own
separate
existence
individuality
tendencies
and
end
the
defection
of
the
slaveholding
states
and
the
fearful
struggle
that
has
followed
for
national
unity
and
integrity
have
brought
it
at
once
to
a
distinct
recognition
of
itself
and
forced
it
to
pass
from
thoughtless
careless
heedless
reckless
adolescence
to
grave
and
reflecting
manhood
the
nation
has
been
suddenly
compelled
to
study
itself
and
henceforth
must
act
from
reflection
understanding
science
statesmanship
not
from
instinct
impulse
passion
or
caprice
knowing
well
what
it
does
and
wherefore
it
does
it
the
change
which
four
years
of
civil
war
have
wrought
in
the
nation
is
great
and
is
sure
to
give
it
the
seriousness
the
gravity
the
dignity
the
manliness
it
has
heretofore
lacked
though
the
nation
has
been
brought
to
a
consciousness
of
its
own
existence
it
has
not
even
yet
attained
to
a
full
and
clear
understanding
of
its
own
national
constitution
its
vision
is
still
obscured
by
the
floating
mists
of
its
earlier
morning
and
its
judgment
rendered
indistinct
and
indecisive
by
the
wild
theories
and
fancies
of
its
childhood
the
national
mind
has
been
quickened
the
national
heart
has
been
opened
the
national
disposition
prepared
but
there
remains
the
important
work
of
dissipating
the
mists
that
still
linger
of
brushing
away
these
wild
theories
and
fancies
and
of
enabling
it
to
form
a
clear
and
intelligent
judgment
of
itself
and
a
true
and
just
appreciation
of
its
own
constitution
tendencies
and
destiny
or
in
other
words
of
enabling
the
nation
to
understand
its
own
idea
and
the
means
of
its
actualization
in
space
and
time
every
living
nation
has
an
idea
given
it
by
providence
to
realize
and
whose
realization
is
its
special
work
mission
or
destiny
every
nation
is
in
some
sense
a
chosen
people
of
god
the
jews
were
the
chosen
people
of
god
through
whom
the
primitive
traditions
were
to
be
preserved
in
their
purity
and
integrity
and
the
messiah
was
to
come
the
greeks
were
the
chosen
people
of
god
for
the
development
and
realization
of
the
beautiful
or
the
divine
splendor
in
art
and
of
the
true
in
science
and
philosophy
and
the
romans
for
the
development
of
the
state
law
and
jurisprudence
the
great
despotic
nations
of
asia
were
never
properly
nations
or
if
they
were
nations
with
a
mission
they
proved
false
to
it
and
count
for
nothing
in
the
progressive
development
of
the
human
race
history
has
not
recorded
their
mission
and
as
far
as
they
are
known
they
have
contributed
only
to
the
abnormal
development
or
corruption
of
religion
and
civilization
despotism
is
barbaric
and
abnormal
the
united
states
or
the
american
republic
has
a
mission
and
is
chosen
of
god
for
the
realization
of
a
great
idea
it
has
been
chosen
not
only
to
continue
the
work
assigned
to
greece
and
rome
but
to
accomplish
a
greater
work
than
was
assigned
to
either
in
art
it
will
prove
false
to
its
mission
if
it
do
not
rival
greece
and
in
science
and
philosophy
if
it
do
not
surpass
it
in
the
state
in
law
in
jurisprudence
it
must
continue
and
surpass
rome
its
idea
is
liberty
indeed
but
liberty
with
law
and
law
with
liberty
yet
its
mission
is
not
so
much
the
realization
of
liberty
as
the
realization
of
the
true
idea
of
the
state
which
secures
at
once
the
authority
of
the
public
and
the
freedom
of
the
individual
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
without
social
despotism
and
individual
freedom
without
anarchy
in
other
words
its
mission
is
to
bring
out
in
its
life
the
dialectic
union
of
authority
and
liberty
of
the
natural
rights
of
man
and
those
of
society
the
greek
and
roman
republics
asserted
the
state
to
the
detriment
of
individual
freedom
modern
republics
either
do
the
same
or
assert
individual
freedom
to
the
detriment
of
the
state
the
american
republic
has
been
instituted
by
providence
to
realize
the
freedom
of
each
with
advantage
to
the
other
the
real
mission
of
the
united
states
is
to
introduce
and
establish
a
political
constitution
which
while
it
retains
all
the
advantages
of
the
constitutions
of
states
thus
far
known
is
unlike
any
of
them
and
secures
advantages
which
none
of
them
did
or
could
possess
the
american
constitution
has
no
prototype
in
any
prior
constitution
the
american
form
of
government
can
be
classed
throughout
with
none
of
the
forms
of
government
described
by
aristotle
or
even
by
later
authorities
aristotle
knew
only
four
forms
of
government
monarchy
aristocracy
democracy
and
mixed
governments
the
american
form
is
none
of
these
nor
any
combination
of
them
it
is
original
a
new
contribution
to
political
science
and
seeks
to
attain
the
end
of
all
wise
and
just
government
by
means
unknown
or
forbidden
to
the
ancients
and
which
have
been
but
imperfectly
comprehended
even
by
american
political
writers
themselves
the
originality
of
the
american
constitution
has
been
overlooked
by
the
great
majority
even
of
our
own
statesmen
who
seek
to
explain
it
by
analogies
borrowed
from
the
constitutions
of
other
states
rather
than
by
a
profound
study
of
its
own
principles
they
have
taken
too
low
a
view
of
it
and
have
rarely
if
ever
appreciated
its
distinctive
and
peculiar
merits
as
the
united
states
have
vindicated
their
national
unity
and
integrity
and
are
preparing
to
take
a
new
start
in
history
nothing
is
more
important
than
that
they
should
take
that
new
start
with
a
clear
and
definite
view
of
their
national
constitution
and
with
a
distinct
understanding
of
their
political
mission
in
the
future
of
the
world
the
citizen
who
can
help
his
countrymen
to
do
this
will
render
them
an
important
service
and
deserve
well
of
his
country
though
he
may
have
been
unable
to
serve
in
her
armies
and
defend
her
on
the
the
work
now
to
be
done
by
american
statesmen
is
even
more
difficult
and
more
delicate
than
that
which
has
been
accomplished
by
our
brave
armies
as
yet
the
people
are
hardly
better
prepared
for
the
political
work
to
be
done
than
they
were
at
the
outbreak
of
the
civil
war
for
the
military
work
they
have
so
nobly
achieved
but
with
time
patience
and
the
difficulties
may
be
overcome
the
errors
of
the
past
corrected
and
the
government
placed
on
the
right
track
for
the
future
it
will
hardly
be
questioned
that
either
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
very
defective
or
it
has
been
very
grossly
misinterpreted
by
all
parties
if
the
slave
states
had
not
held
that
the
states
are
severally
sovereign
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
a
simple
agreement
or
compact
they
would
never
have
seceded
and
if
the
free
states
had
not
confounded
the
union
with
the
general
government
and
shown
a
tendency
to
make
it
the
entire
national
government
no
occasion
or
pretext
for
secession
would
have
been
given
the
great
problem
of
our
statesmen
has
been
from
the
first
how
to
assert
union
without
consolidation
and
state
rights
without
disintegration
have
they
as
yet
solved
that
problem
the
war
has
silenced
the
state
sovereignty
doctrine
indeed
but
has
it
done
so
without
lesion
to
state
rights
has
it
done
it
without
asserting
the
general
government
as
the
supreme
central
or
national
government
has
it
done
it
without
striking
a
dangerous
blow
at
the
federal
element
of
the
constitution
in
suppressing
by
armed
force
the
doctrine
that
the
states
are
severally
sovereign
what
barrier
is
left
against
consolidation
has
not
one
danger
been
removed
only
to
give
place
to
another
but
perhaps
the
constitution
itself
if
rightly
understood
solves
the
problem
and
perhaps
the
problem
itself
is
raised
precisely
through
misunderstanding
of
the
constitution
our
statesmen
have
recognized
no
constitution
of
the
american
people
themselves
they
have
confined
their
views
to
the
written
constitution
as
if
that
constituted
the
american
people
a
state
or
nation
instead
of
being
as
it
is
only
a
law
ordained
by
the
nation
already
existing
and
constituted
perhaps
if
they
had
recognized
and
studied
the
constitution
which
preceded
that
drawn
up
by
the
convention
of
and
which
is
intrinsic
inherent
in
the
republic
itself
they
would
have
seen
that
it
solves
the
problem
and
asserts
national
unity
without
consolidation
and
the
rights
of
the
several
states
without
danger
of
disintegration
the
whole
controversy
possibly
has
originated
in
a
misunderstanding
of
the
real
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
that
misunderstanding
itself
in
the
misunderstanding
of
the
origin
and
constitution
of
government
in
general
the
constitution
as
will
appear
in
the
course
of
this
essay
is
not
defective
and
all
that
is
necessary
to
guard
against
either
danger
is
to
discard
all
our
theories
of
the
constitution
and
return
and
adhere
to
the
constitution
itself
as
it
really
is
and
always
has
been
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
question
of
slavery
had
much
to
do
with
the
rebellion
but
it
was
not
its
sole
cause
the
real
cause
must
be
sought
in
the
program
that
had
been
made
especially
in
the
states
themselves
in
forming
and
administering
their
respective
governments
as
well
as
the
general
government
in
accordance
with
political
theories
borrowed
from
european
speculators
on
government
the
liberals
and
revolutionists
which
have
and
can
have
no
legitimate
application
in
the
united
states
the
tendency
of
american
politics
for
the
last
thirty
or
forty
years
has
been
within
the
several
states
themselves
in
the
direction
of
centralized
democracy
as
if
the
american
people
had
for
their
mission
only
the
reproduction
of
ancient
athens
the
american
system
is
not
that
of
any
of
the
simple
forms
of
government
nor
any
combination
of
them
the
attempt
to
bring
it
under
any
of
the
simple
or
mixed
forms
of
government
recognized
by
political
writers
is
an
attempt
to
clothe
the
future
in
the
garments
of
the
past
the
american
system
wherever
practicable
is
better
than
monarchy
better
than
aristocracy
better
than
simple
democracy
better
than
any
possible
combination
of
these
several
forms
because
it
accords
more
nearly
with
the
principles
of
things
the
real
order
of
the
universe
but
american
statesmen
have
studied
the
constitutions
of
other
states
more
than
that
of
their
own
and
have
succeeded
in
obscuring
the
american
system
in
the
minds
of
the
people
and
giving
them
in
its
place
pure
and
simple
democracy
which
is
its
false
development
or
corruption
under
the
influence
of
this
false
development
the
people
were
fast
losing
sight
of
the
political
truth
that
though
the
people
are
sovereign
it
is
the
organic
not
the
inorganic
people
the
territorial
people
not
the
people
as
simple
population
and
were
beginning
to
assert
the
absolute
right
of
the
majority
to
govern
all
the
changes
made
in
the
bosom
of
the
states
themselves
have
consisted
in
removing
all
obstacles
to
the
irresponsible
will
of
the
majority
leaving
minorities
and
individuals
at
their
mercy
this
tendency
to
a
centralized
democracy
had
more
to
do
with
provoking
secession
and
rebellion
than
the
sentiments
of
the
northern
central
and
western
states
the
failure
of
secession
and
the
triumph
of
the
national
cause
in
spite
of
the
and
blundering
of
the
administration
have
proved
the
vitality
and
strength
of
the
national
constitution
and
the
greatness
of
the
american
people
they
say
nothing
for
or
against
the
democratic
theory
of
our
demagogues
but
every
thing
in
favor
of
the
american
system
or
constitution
of
government
which
has
found
a
firmer
support
in
american
instincts
than
in
american
statesmanship
in
spite
of
all
that
had
been
done
by
theorists
radicals
and
revolutionists
men
humanitarians
and
sickly
sentimentalists
to
corrupt
the
american
people
in
mind
heart
and
body
the
native
vigor
of
their
national
constitution
has
enabled
them
to
come
forth
triumphant
from
the
trial
every
american
patriot
has
reason
to
be
proud
of
his
and
every
american
lover
of
freedom
to
be
satisfied
with
the
institutions
of
his
country
but
there
is
danger
that
the
politicians
and
demagogues
will
ascribe
the
merit
not
to
the
real
and
living
national
constitution
but
to
their
miserable
theories
of
that
constitution
and
labor
to
aggravate
the
several
evils
and
corrupt
tendencies
which
caused
the
rebellion
it
has
cost
so
much
to
suppress
what
is
now
wanted
is
that
the
people
whose
instincts
are
right
should
understand
the
american
constitution
as
it
is
and
so
understand
it
as
to
render
it
impossible
for
political
theorists
no
matter
of
what
school
or
party
to
deceive
them
again
as
to
its
real
import
or
induce
them
to
depart
from
it
in
their
political
action
a
work
written
with
temper
without
passion
or
sectional
prejudice
in
a
philosophical
spirit
explaining
to
the
american
people
their
own
national
constitution
and
the
mutual
relations
of
the
general
government
and
the
state
governments
can
not
at
this
important
crisis
in
our
affairs
be
inopportune
and
if
properly
executed
can
hardly
fail
to
be
of
real
service
such
a
work
is
now
attempted
would
it
were
by
another
and
abler
hand
which
imperfect
as
it
is
may
at
least
offer
some
useful
suggestions
give
a
right
direction
to
political
thought
although
it
should
fail
to
satisfy
the
mind
of
the
reader
this
much
the
author
may
say
in
favor
of
his
own
work
that
it
sets
forth
no
theory
of
government
in
general
or
of
the
united
states
in
particular
the
author
is
not
a
monarchist
an
aristocrat
a
democrat
a
feudalist
nor
an
advocate
of
what
are
called
mixed
governments
like
the
english
at
least
for
his
own
country
but
is
simply
an
american
devoted
to
the
real
living
and
energizing
constitution
of
the
american
republic
as
it
is
not
as
some
may
fancy
it
might
be
or
are
striving
to
make
it
it
is
in
his
judgment
what
it
ought
to
be
and
he
has
no
other
ambition
than
to
present
it
as
it
is
to
the
understanding
and
love
of
his
countrymen
perhaps
simple
artistic
unity
and
propriety
would
require
the
author
to
commence
his
essay
directly
with
the
united
states
but
while
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
original
and
peculiar
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
necessarily
something
in
common
with
all
legitimate
governments
and
he
has
thought
it
best
to
precede
his
discussion
of
the
american
republic
its
constitution
tendencies
and
destiny
by
some
considerations
on
government
in
general
he
does
this
because
he
believes
whether
rightly
or
not
that
while
the
american
people
have
received
from
providence
a
most
truly
profound
and
admirable
system
of
government
they
are
more
or
less
infected
with
the
false
theories
of
government
which
have
been
broached
during
the
last
two
centuries
in
attempting
to
realize
these
theories
they
have
already
provoked
or
rendered
practicable
a
rebellion
which
has
seriously
threatened
the
national
existence
and
come
very
near
putting
an
end
to
the
american
order
of
civilization
itself
these
theories
have
received
already
a
shock
in
the
minds
of
all
serious
and
thinking
men
but
the
men
who
think
are
in
every
nation
a
small
minority
and
it
is
necessary
to
give
these
theories
a
public
refutation
and
bring
back
those
who
do
not
think
as
well
as
those
who
do
from
the
world
of
dreams
to
the
world
of
reality
it
is
hoped
therefore
that
any
apparent
want
of
artistic
unity
or
symmetry
in
the
essay
will
be
pardoned
for
the
sake
of
the
end
the
author
has
had
in
view
chapter
ii
government
man
is
a
dependent
being
and
neither
does
nor
can
suffice
for
himself
he
lives
not
in
himself
but
lives
and
moves
and
has
his
being
in
god
he
exists
develops
and
fulfils
his
existence
only
by
communion
with
god
through
which
he
participates
of
the
divine
being
and
life
he
communes
with
god
through
the
divine
creative
act
and
the
incarnation
of
the
word
through
his
kind
and
through
the
material
world
communion
with
god
through
creation
and
incarnation
is
religion
distinctively
taken
which
binds
man
to
god
as
his
first
cause
and
carries
him
onward
to
god
as
his
final
cause
communion
through
the
material
world
is
expressed
by
the
word
property
and
communion
with
god
through
humanity
is
society
religion
society
property
are
the
three
terms
that
embrace
the
whole
of
man
life
and
express
the
essential
means
and
conditions
of
his
existence
his
development
and
his
perfection
or
the
fulfilment
of
his
existence
the
attainment
of
the
end
for
which
he
is
created
though
society
or
the
communion
of
man
with
his
maker
through
his
kind
is
not
all
that
man
needs
in
order
to
live
to
grow
to
actualize
the
possibilities
of
his
nature
and
to
attain
to
his
beatitude
since
humanity
is
neither
god
nor
the
material
universe
it
is
yet
a
necessary
and
essential
condition
of
his
life
his
progress
and
the
completion
of
his
existence
he
is
born
and
lives
in
society
and
can
be
born
and
live
nowhere
else
it
is
one
of
the
necessities
of
his
nature
god
saw
that
it
was
not
good
for
man
to
be
alone
hence
wherever
man
is
found
he
is
found
in
society
living
in
more
or
less
strict
intercourse
with
his
kind
but
society
never
does
and
never
can
exist
without
government
of
some
sort
as
society
is
a
necessity
of
man
nature
so
is
government
a
necessity
of
society
the
simplest
form
of
society
is
the
family
adam
and
eve
but
though
adam
and
eve
are
in
many
respects
equal
and
have
equally
important
though
different
parts
assigned
them
one
or
the
other
must
be
head
and
governor
or
they
can
not
form
the
society
called
family
they
would
be
simply
two
individuals
of
different
sexes
and
the
family
would
fail
for
the
want
of
unity
children
can
not
be
reared
trained
or
educated
without
some
degree
of
family
government
of
some
authority
to
direct
control
restrain
or
prescribe
hence
the
authority
of
the
husband
and
father
is
recognized
by
the
common
consent
of
mankind
still
more
apparent
is
the
necessity
of
government
the
moment
the
family
develops
and
grows
into
the
tribe
and
the
tribe
into
the
nation
hence
no
nation
exists
without
government
and
we
never
find
a
savage
tribe
however
low
or
degraded
that
does
not
assert
somewhere
in
the
father
in
the
elders
or
in
the
tribe
itself
the
rude
outlines
or
the
faint
reminiscences
of
some
sort
of
government
with
authority
to
demand
obedience
and
to
punish
the
refractory
hence
as
man
is
nowhere
found
out
of
society
so
nowhere
is
society
found
without
government
government
is
necessary
but
let
it
be
remarked
by
the
way
that
its
necessity
does
not
grow
exclusively
or
chiefly
out
of
the
fact
that
the
human
race
by
sin
has
fallen
from
its
primitive
integrity
or
original
righteousness
the
fall
asserted
by
christian
theology
though
often
misinterpreted
and
its
effects
underrated
or
exaggerated
is
a
fact
too
sadly
confirmed
by
individual
experience
and
universal
history
but
it
is
not
the
cause
why
government
is
necessary
though
it
may
be
an
additional
reason
for
demanding
it
government
would
have
been
necessary
if
man
had
not
sinned
and
it
is
needed
for
the
good
as
well
as
for
the
bad
the
law
was
promulgated
in
the
garden
while
man
retained
his
innocence
and
remained
in
the
integrity
of
his
nature
it
exists
in
heaven
as
well
as
on
earth
and
in
heaven
in
its
perfection
its
office
is
not
purely
repressive
to
restrain
violence
to
redress
wrongs
and
to
punish
the
transgressor
it
has
something
more
to
do
than
to
restrict
our
natural
liberty
curb
our
passions
and
maintain
justice
between
man
and
man
its
office
is
positive
as
well
as
negative
it
is
needed
to
render
effective
the
solidarity
of
the
individuals
of
a
nation
and
to
render
the
nation
an
organism
not
a
mere
organization
to
combine
men
in
one
living
body
and
to
strengthen
all
with
the
strength
of
each
and
each
with
the
strength
of
all
to
develop
strengthen
and
sustain
individual
liberty
and
to
utilize
and
direct
it
to
the
promotion
of
the
common
weal
to
be
a
social
providence
imitating
in
its
order
and
degree
the
action
of
the
divine
providence
itself
and
while
it
provides
for
the
common
good
of
all
to
protect
each
the
lowest
and
meanest
with
the
whole
force
and
majesty
of
society
it
is
the
minister
of
wrath
to
indeed
but
its
nature
is
beneficent
and
its
action
defines
and
protects
the
right
of
property
creates
and
maintains
a
medium
in
which
religion
can
exert
her
supernatural
energy
promotes
learning
fosters
science
and
art
advances
civilization
and
contributes
as
a
powerful
means
to
the
fulfilment
by
man
of
the
divine
purpose
in
his
existence
next
after
religion
it
is
man
greatest
good
and
even
religion
without
it
can
do
only
a
small
portion
of
her
work
they
wrong
it
who
call
it
a
necessary
evil
it
is
a
great
good
and
instead
of
being
distrusted
hated
or
resisted
except
in
its
abuses
it
should
be
loved
respected
obeyed
and
if
need
be
defended
at
the
cost
of
all
earthly
goods
and
even
of
life
itself
the
nature
or
essence
of
government
is
to
govern
a
government
that
does
not
govern
is
simply
no
government
at
all
if
it
has
not
the
ability
to
govern
and
governs
not
it
may
be
an
agency
an
instrument
in
the
bands
of
individuals
for
advancing
their
private
interests
but
it
is
not
government
to
be
government
it
must
govern
both
individuals
and
the
community
if
it
is
a
mere
machine
for
making
prevail
the
will
of
one
man
of
a
certain
number
of
men
or
even
of
the
community
it
may
be
very
effective
sometimes
for
good
sometimes
for
evil
oftenest
for
evil
but
government
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
it
is
not
to
govern
is
to
direct
control
restrain
as
the
pilot
controls
and
directs
his
ship
it
necessarily
implies
two
terms
governor
and
governed
and
a
real
distinction
between
them
the
denial
of
all
real
distinction
between
governor
and
governed
is
an
error
in
politics
analogous
to
that
in
philosophy
or
theology
of
denying
all
real
distinction
between
creator
and
creature
god
and
the
universe
which
all
the
world
knows
is
either
pantheism
or
pure
atheism
the
supreme
sophism
if
we
make
governor
and
governed
one
and
the
same
we
efface
both
terms
for
there
is
no
governor
nor
governed
if
the
will
that
governs
is
identically
the
will
that
is
governed
to
make
the
controller
and
the
controlled
the
same
is
precisely
to
deny
all
control
there
must
then
if
there
is
government
at
all
be
a
power
force
or
will
that
governs
distinct
from
that
which
is
governed
in
those
governments
in
which
it
is
held
that
the
people
govern
the
people
governing
do
and
must
act
in
a
diverse
relation
from
the
people
governed
or
there
is
no
real
government
government
is
not
only
that
which
governs
but
that
which
has
the
right
or
authority
to
govern
power
without
right
is
not
government
governments
have
the
right
to
use
force
at
need
but
might
does
not
make
right
and
not
every
power
wielding
the
physical
force
of
a
nation
is
to
be
regarded
as
its
rightful
government
whatever
resort
to
physical
force
it
may
be
obliged
to
make
either
in
defence
of
its
authority
or
of
the
rights
of
the
nation
the
government
itself
lies
in
the
moral
order
and
politics
is
simply
a
branch
of
ethics
that
branch
which
treats
of
the
rights
and
duties
of
men
in
their
public
relations
as
distinguished
from
their
rights
and
duties
in
their
private
relations
government
being
not
only
that
which
governs
but
that
which
has
the
right
to
govern
obedience
to
it
becomes
a
moral
duty
not
a
mere
physical
necessity
the
right
to
govern
and
the
duty
to
obey
are
correlatives
and
the
one
can
not
exist
or
be
conceived
without
the
other
hence
loyalty
is
not
simply
an
amiable
sentiment
but
a
duty
a
moral
virtue
treason
is
not
merely
a
difference
in
political
opinion
with
the
governing
authority
but
a
crime
against
the
sovereign
and
a
moral
wrong
therefore
a
sin
against
god
the
founder
of
the
moral
law
treason
if
committed
in
other
countries
unhappily
has
been
more
frequently
termed
by
our
countrymen
patriotism
and
loaded
with
honor
than
branded
as
a
crime
the
greatest
of
crimes
as
it
is
that
human
governments
have
authority
to
punish
the
american
people
have
been
chary
of
the
word
loyalty
perhaps
because
they
regard
it
as
the
correlative
of
royalty
but
loyalty
is
rather
the
correlative
of
law
and
is
in
its
essence
love
and
devotion
to
the
sovereign
authority
however
constituted
or
wherever
lodged
it
is
as
necessary
as
much
a
duty
as
much
a
virtue
in
republics
as
in
monarchies
and
nobler
examples
of
the
most
devoted
loyalty
are
not
found
in
the
history
than
were
exhibited
in
the
ancient
greek
and
roman
republics
or
than
have
been
exhibited
by
both
men
and
women
in
the
young
republic
of
the
united
states
loyalty
is
the
highest
noblest
and
most
generous
of
human
virtues
and
is
the
human
element
of
that
sublime
love
or
charity
which
the
inspired
apostle
tells
us
is
the
fulfilment
of
the
law
it
has
in
it
the
principle
of
devotion
of
and
is
of
all
human
virtues
that
which
renders
man
the
most
godlike
there
is
nothing
great
generous
good
or
heroic
of
which
a
truly
loyal
people
are
not
capable
and
nothing
mean
base
cruel
brutal
criminal
detestable
not
to
be
expected
of
a
really
disloyal
people
such
a
people
no
generous
sentiment
can
move
no
love
can
bind
it
mocks
at
duty
scorns
virtue
tramples
on
all
rights
and
holds
no
person
no
thing
human
or
divine
sacred
or
inviolable
the
assertion
of
government
as
lying
in
the
moral
order
defines
civil
liberty
and
reconciles
it
with
authority
civil
liberty
is
freedom
to
do
whatever
one
pleases
that
authority
permits
or
does
not
forbid
freedom
to
follow
in
all
things
one
own
will
or
inclination
without
any
civil
restraint
is
license
not
liberty
there
is
no
lesion
to
liberty
in
repressing
license
nor
in
requiring
obedience
to
the
commands
of
the
authority
that
has
the
right
to
command
tyranny
or
oppression
is
not
in
being
subjected
to
authority
but
in
being
subjected
to
usurped
authority
to
a
power
that
has
no
right
to
command
or
that
commands
what
exceeds
its
right
or
its
authority
to
say
that
it
is
contrary
to
liberty
to
be
forced
to
forego
our
own
will
or
inclination
in
any
case
whatever
is
simply
denying
the
right
of
all
government
and
falling
into
liberty
is
violated
only
when
we
are
required
to
forego
our
own
will
or
inclination
by
a
power
that
has
no
right
to
make
the
requisition
for
we
are
bound
to
obedience
as
far
as
authority
has
right
to
govern
and
we
can
never
have
the
right
to
disobey
a
rightful
command
the
requisition
if
made
by
rightful
authority
then
violates
no
right
that
we
have
or
can
have
and
where
there
is
no
violation
of
our
rights
there
is
no
violation
of
our
liberty
the
moral
right
of
authority
which
involves
the
moral
duty
of
obedience
presents
then
the
ground
on
which
liberty
and
authority
may
meet
in
peace
and
operate
to
the
same
end
this
has
no
resemblance
to
the
slavish
doctrine
of
passive
obedience
and
that
the
resistance
to
power
can
never
be
lawful
the
tyrant
may
be
lawfully
resisted
for
the
tyrant
by
force
of
the
word
itself
is
a
usurper
and
without
authority
abuses
of
power
may
be
resisted
even
by
force
when
they
become
too
great
to
be
endured
when
there
is
no
legal
or
regular
way
of
redressing
them
and
when
there
is
a
reasonable
prospect
that
resistance
will
prove
effectual
and
substitute
something
better
in
their
place
but
it
is
never
lawful
to
resist
the
rightful
sovereign
for
it
can
never
be
right
to
resist
right
and
the
rightful
sovereign
in
the
constitutional
exercise
of
his
power
can
never
be
said
to
abuse
it
abuse
is
the
unconstitutional
or
wrongful
exercise
of
a
power
rightfully
held
and
when
it
is
not
so
exercised
there
is
no
abuse
or
abuses
to
redress
all
turns
then
on
the
right
of
power
or
its
legitimacy
whence
does
government
derive
its
right
to
govern
what
is
the
origin
and
ground
of
sovereignty
this
question
is
fundamental
and
without
a
true
answer
to
it
politics
can
not
be
a
science
and
there
can
be
no
scientific
statesmanship
whence
then
comes
the
sovereign
right
to
govern
chapter
iii
origin
of
government
government
is
both
a
fact
and
a
right
its
origin
as
a
fact
is
simply
a
question
of
history
its
origin
as
a
right
or
authority
to
govern
is
a
question
of
ethics
whether
a
certain
territory
and
its
population
are
a
sovereign
state
or
nation
or
not
whether
the
actual
ruler
of
a
country
is
its
rightful
ruler
or
not
is
to
be
determined
by
the
historical
facts
in
the
case
but
whence
the
government
derives
its
right
to
govern
is
a
question
that
can
be
solved
only
by
philosophy
or
philosophy
failing
only
by
revelation
political
writers
not
carefully
distinguishing
between
the
fact
and
the
right
have
invented
various
theories
as
to
the
origin
of
government
among
which
may
be
named
i
government
originates
in
the
right
of
the
father
to
govern
his
child
ii
it
originates
in
convention
and
is
a
social
compact
iii
it
originates
in
the
people
who
collectively
taken
are
sovereign
iv
government
springs
from
the
spontaneous
development
of
nature
it
derives
its
right
from
the
immediate
and
express
appointment
of
god
vi
from
god
through
the
pope
or
visible
head
of
the
spiritual
society
vii
from
god
through
the
people
viii
from
god
through
the
natural
law
i
the
first
theory
is
sound
if
the
question
is
confined
to
the
origin
of
government
as
a
fact
the
patriarchal
system
is
the
earliest
known
system
of
government
and
unmistakable
traces
of
it
are
found
in
nearly
all
known
governments
in
the
tribes
of
arabia
and
northern
africa
the
irish
septs
and
the
scottish
clans
the
tartar
hordes
the
roman
qentes
and
the
russian
and
hindoo
villages
the
right
of
the
father
was
held
to
be
his
right
to
govern
his
family
or
household
which
with
his
children
included
his
wife
and
servants
from
the
family
to
the
tribe
the
transition
is
natural
and
easy
as
also
from
the
tribe
to
the
nation
the
father
is
chief
of
the
family
the
chief
of
the
eldest
family
is
chief
of
the
tribe
the
chief
of
the
eldest
tribe
becomes
chief
of
the
nation
and
as
such
king
or
monarch
the
heads
of
families
collected
in
a
senate
form
an
aristocracy
and
the
families
themselves
represented
by
their
delegates
or
publicly
assembling
for
public
affairs
constitute
a
democracy
these
three
forms
with
their
several
combinations
to
wit
monarchy
aristocracy
democracy
and
mixed
governments
are
all
the
forms
known
to
aristotle
and
have
generally
been
held
to
be
all
that
are
possible
historically
all
governments
have
in
some
sense
been
developed
from
the
patriarchal
as
all
society
has
been
developed
from
the
family
even
those
governments
like
the
ancient
roman
and
the
modern
feudal
which
seem
to
be
founded
on
landed
property
may
be
traced
back
to
a
patriarchal
origin
the
patriarch
is
sole
proprietor
and
the
possessions
of
the
family
are
vested
in
him
and
he
governs
as
proprietor
as
well
as
father
in
the
tribe
the
chief
is
the
proprietor
and
in
the
nation
the
king
is
the
landlord
and
holds
the
domain
hence
the
feudal
baron
is
invested
with
his
fief
by
the
suzerain
holds
it
from
him
and
to
him
it
escheats
when
forfeited
or
vacant
all
the
great
asiatic
kings
of
ancient
or
modern
times
hold
the
domain
and
govern
as
proprietors
they
have
the
authority
of
the
father
and
the
owner
and
their
subjects
though
theoretically
their
children
are
really
their
slaves
in
rome
however
the
proprietary
right
undergoes
an
important
transformation
the
father
retains
all
the
power
of
the
patriarch
within
his
family
the
patrician
in
his
gens
or
house
but
outside
of
it
is
met
and
controlled
by
the
city
or
state
the
heads
of
houses
are
united
in
the
senate
and
collectively
constitute
and
govern
the
state
yet
not
all
the
heads
of
houses
have
seats
in
the
senate
but
only
the
tenants
of
the
sacred
territory
of
the
city
which
has
been
surveyed
and
marked
by
the
god
terminus
hence
the
great
plebeian
houses
often
richer
and
nobler
than
the
patrician
were
excluded
from
all
share
in
the
government
and
the
honors
of
the
state
because
they
were
not
tenants
of
any
portion
of
the
sacred
territory
there
is
here
the
introduction
of
an
element
which
is
not
patriarchal
and
which
transforms
the
patriarch
or
chief
of
a
tribe
into
the
city
or
state
and
founds
the
civil
order
or
what
is
now
called
civilization
the
city
or
state
takes
the
place
of
the
private
proprietor
and
territorial
rights
take
the
place
of
purely
personal
rights
in
the
theory
of
the
roman
law
the
land
owns
the
man
not
the
man
the
land
when
land
was
transferred
to
a
new
tenant
the
practice
in
early
times
was
to
bury
him
in
it
in
order
to
indicate
that
it
took
possession
of
him
received
accepted
or
adopted
him
and
it
was
only
such
persons
as
were
taken
possession
of
accepted
or
adopted
by
the
sacred
territory
or
domain
that
though
denizens
of
rome
were
citizens
with
full
political
rights
this
in
modern
language
means
that
the
state
is
territorial
not
personal
and
that
the
citizen
appertains
to
the
state
not
the
state
to
the
citizen
under
the
patriarchal
the
tribal
and
the
asiatic
monarchical
systems
there
is
properly
speaking
no
state
no
citizens
and
the
organization
is
economical
rather
than
political
authority
even
the
nation
itself
is
personal
not
territorial
the
patriarch
the
chief
of
the
tribe
or
the
king
is
the
only
proprietor
under
the
system
all
this
is
transformed
the
nation
is
territorial
as
well
as
personal
and
the
real
proprietor
is
the
city
or
state
under
the
empire
no
doubt
what
lawyers
call
the
eminent
domain
was
vested
in
the
emperor
but
only
as
the
representative
and
trustee
of
the
city
or
state
when
or
by
what
combination
of
events
this
transformation
was
effected
history
does
not
inform
us
the
of
adam
we
are
told
built
a
city
and
called
it
after
his
son
enoch
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
was
constituted
a
municipality
the
earliest
traces
of
the
civil
order
proper
are
found
in
the
greek
and
italian
republics
and
its
fullest
and
grandest
developments
are
found
in
rome
imperial
as
well
as
republican
it
was
no
doubt
preceded
by
the
patriarchal
system
and
was
historically
developed
from
it
but
by
way
of
accretion
rather
than
by
simple
explication
it
has
in
it
an
element
that
if
it
exists
in
the
patriarchal
constitution
exists
there
only
in
a
different
form
and
the
transformation
marks
the
passage
from
the
economical
order
to
the
political
from
the
barbaric
to
the
civil
constitution
of
society
or
from
barbarism
to
civilization
the
word
civilization
stands
opposed
to
barbarism
and
is
derived
from
civitas
city
or
state
the
greeks
and
romans
call
all
tribes
and
nations
in
which
authority
is
vested
in
the
chief
as
distinguished
from
the
state
barbarians
the
origin
of
the
word
barbarian
barbarus
or
is
unknown
and
its
primary
sense
can
be
only
conjectured
webster
regards
its
primary
sense
as
foreign
wild
fierce
but
this
could
not
have
been
its
original
sense
for
the
greeks
and
romans
never
termed
all
foreigners
barbarians
and
they
applied
the
term
to
nations
that
had
no
inconsiderable
culture
and
refinement
of
manners
and
that
had
made
respectable
progress
in
art
and
sciences
the
indians
persians
medians
chaldeans
and
assyrians
they
applied
the
term
evidently
in
a
political
not
an
ethical
or
an
aesthetical
sense
and
as
it
would
seem
to
designate
a
social
order
in
which
the
state
was
not
developed
and
in
which
the
nation
was
personal
not
territorial
and
authority
was
held
as
a
private
right
not
as
a
public
trust
or
in
which
the
domain
vests
in
the
chief
or
tribe
and
not
in
the
state
for
they
never
term
any
others
barbarians
republic
is
opposed
not
to
monarchy
in
the
modern
european
sense
but
to
monarchy
in
the
ancient
or
absolute
sense
lacedaemon
had
kings
yet
it
was
no
less
republican
than
athens
and
rome
was
called
and
was
a
republic
under
the
emperors
no
less
than
under
the
consuls
republic
respublica
by
the
very
force
of
the
term
means
the
public
wealth
or
in
good
english
the
commonwealth
that
is
government
founded
not
on
personal
or
private
wealth
but
on
the
public
wealth
public
territory
or
domain
or
a
government
that
vests
authority
in
the
nation
and
attaches
the
nation
to
a
certain
definite
territory
france
spain
italy
holland
belgium
denmark
even
great
britain
in
substance
though
not
in
form
are
all
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
word
republican
states
for
the
king
or
emperor
does
not
govern
in
his
own
private
right
but
solely
as
representative
of
the
power
and
majesty
of
the
state
the
distinctive
mark
of
republicanism
is
the
substitution
of
the
state
for
the
personal
chief
and
public
authority
for
personal
or
private
right
republicanism
is
really
civilization
as
opposed
to
barbarism
and
all
civility
in
the
old
sense
of
the
word
or
civilian
in
italian
is
republican
and
is
applied
in
modern
times
to
breeding
or
refinement
of
manners
simply
because
these
are
characteristics
of
a
republican
or
polished
from
city
people
every
people
that
has
a
real
civil
order
or
a
fully
developed
state
or
polity
is
a
republican
people
and
hence
the
church
and
her
great
doctors
when
they
speak
of
the
state
as
distinguished
from
the
church
call
it
the
republic
as
may
be
seen
by
consulting
even
a
late
encyclical
of
pius
which
some
have
interpreted
wrongly
in
an
sense
all
tribes
and
nations
in
which
the
patriarchal
system
remains
or
is
developed
without
transformation
are
barbaric
and
really
so
regarded
by
all
christendom
in
civilized
nations
the
patriarchal
authority
is
transformed
into
that
of
the
city
or
state
that
is
of
the
republic
but
in
all
barbarous
nations
it
retains
its
private
and
personal
character
the
nation
is
only
the
family
or
tribe
and
is
called
by
the
name
of
its
ancestor
founder
or
chief
not
by
a
geographical
denomination
race
has
not
been
supplanted
by
country
they
are
a
people
not
a
state
they
are
not
fixed
to
the
soil
and
though
we
may
find
in
them
ardent
love
of
family
the
tribe
or
the
chief
we
never
find
among
them
that
pure
love
of
country
or
patriotism
which
so
distinguished
the
greeks
and
romans
and
is
no
less
marked
among
modern
christian
nations
they
have
a
family
a
race
a
chief
or
king
but
no
patria
or
country
the
barbarians
who
overthrew
the
roman
empire
whether
of
the
west
or
the
east
were
nations
or
confederacies
of
nations
but
not
states
the
nation
with
them
was
personal
not
territorial
their
country
was
wherever
they
fed
their
flocks
and
herds
pitched
their
tents
and
encamped
for
the
night
there
were
germans
but
no
german
state
and
even
the
german

his

the
german

is
spoken
the
polish
sclavonian
hungarian
illyrian
italian
and
other
provinces
held
by
german
states
in
which
the
german
language
is
not
the
are
excluded
from
the
germanic
confederation
the
turks
or
osmanlis
are
a
race
not
a
state
and
are
encamped
not
settled
on
the
site
of
the
eastern
roman
or
greek
empire
even
when
the
barbaric
nations
have
ceased
to
be
nomadic
pastoral
or
predatory
nations
as
the
ancient
assyrians
and
persians
or
modern
chinese
and
have
their
geographical
boundaries
they
have
still
no
state
no
country
the
nation
defines
the
boundaries
not
the
boundaries
the
nation
the
nation
does
not
belong
to
the
territory
but
the
territory
to
the
nation
or
its
chief
the
irish
and
in
former
times
held
the
land
in
gavelkind
and
the
territory
belonged
to
the
tribe
or
sept
but
if
the
tribe
held
it
as
indivisible
they
still
held
it
as
private
property
the
shah
of
persia
holds
the
whole
persian
territory
as
private
property
and
the
landholders
among
his
subjects
are
held
to
be
his
tenants
they
hold
it
from
him
not
from
the
persian
state
the
public
domain
of
the
greek
empire
is
in
theory
the
private
domain
of
the
ottoman
emperor
or
turkish
sultan
there
is
in
barbaric
states
no
republic
no
commonwealth
authority
is
parental
without
being
tempered
by
parental
affection
the
chief
is
a
despot
and
rules
with
the
united
authority
of
the
father
and
the
harshness
of
the
proprietor
he
owns
the
land
and
his
subjects
feudalism
established
in
western
europe
after
the
downfall
of
the
roman
empire
however
modified
by
the
church
and
by
reminiscences
of
civilization
retained
by
the
conquered
was
a
barbaric
constitution
the
feudal
monarch
as
far
as
he
governed
at
all
governed
as
proprietor
or
landholder
not
as
the
representative
of
the
commonwealth
under
feudalism
there
are
estates
but
no
state
the
king
governs
as
an
estate
the
nobles
hold
their
power
as
an
estate
and
the
commons
are
represented
as
an
estate
the
whole
theory
of
power
is
that
it
is
an
estate
a
private
right
not
a
public
trust
it
is
not
without
reason
then
that
the
common
sense
of
civilized
nations
terms
the
ages
when
it
prevailed
in
western
europe
barbarous
ages
it
may
seem
a
paradox
to
class
democracy
with
the
barbaric
constitutions
and
yet
as
it
is
defended
by
many
stanch
democrats
especially
european
democrats
and
revolutionists
and
by
french
and
germans
settled
in
our
own
country
it
is
essentially
barbaric
and
the
characteristic
principle
of
barbarism
is
that
power
is
a
private
or
personal
right
and
when
democrats
assert
that
the
elective
franchise
is
a
natural
right
of
man
or
that
it
is
held
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
elector
is
a
man
they
assert
the
fundamental
principle
of
barbarism
and
despotism
this
says
nothing
in
favor
of
restricted
suffrage
or
against
what
is
called
universal
suffrage
to
restrict
suffrage
to
helps
nothing
theoretically
or
practically
property
has
of
itself
advantages
enough
without
clothing
its
holders
with
exclusive
political
rights
and
privileges
and
the
laboring
classes
any
day
are
as
trustworthy
as
the
business
classes
the
wise
statesman
will
never
restrict
suffrage
or
exclude
the
poorer
and
more
numerous
classes
from
all
voice
in
the
government
of
their
country
general
suffrage
is
wise
and
if
louis
philippe
had
had
the
sense
to
adopt
it
and
thus
rally
the
whole
nation
to
the
support
of
his
government
he
would
never
have
had
to
encounter
the
revolution
of
the
barbarism
the
despotism
is
not
in
universal
suffrage
but
in
defending
the
elective
franchise
as
a
private
or
personal
right
it
is
not
a
private
but
a
political
right
and
like
all
political
rights
a
public
trust
extremes
meet
and
thus
it
is
that
men
who
imagine
that
they
march
at
the
head
of
the
human
race
and
lead
the
civilization
of
the
age
are
really
in
principle
retrograding
to
the
barbarism
of
the
past
or
taking
their
place
with
nations
on
whom
the
light
of
civilization
has
never
yet
dawned
all
is
not
gold
that
glisters
the
characteristic
of
barbarism
is
that
it
makes
all
authority
a
private
or
personal
right
and
the
characteristic
of
civilization
is
that
it
makes
it
a
public
trust
barbarism
knows
only
persons
civilization
asserts
and
maintains
the
state
with
barbarians
the
authority
of
the
patriarch
is
developed
simply
by
way
of
explication
in
civilized
states
it
is
developed
by
way
of
transformation
keeping
in
mind
this
distinction
it
may
be
maintained
that
all
systems
of
government
as
a
simple
historical
fact
have
been
developed
from
the
patriarchal
the
patriarchal
has
preceded
them
all
and
it
is
with
the
patriarchal
that
the
human
race
has
begun
its
career
the
family
or
household
is
not
a
state
a
civil
polity
but
it
is
a
government
and
historically
considered
is
the
initial
or
inchoate
state
as
well
as
the
initial
or
inchoate
nation
but
its
simple
direct
development
gives
us
barbarism
or
what
is
called
oriental
despotism
and
which
nowhere
exists
or
can
exist
in
christendom
it
is
found
only
in
pagan
and
mohammedan
nations
christianity
in
the
secular
order
is
republican
and
continues
and
completes
the
work
of
greece
and
rome
it
meets
with
little
permanent
success
in
any
patriarchal
or
despotic
nation
and
must
either
find
or
create
civilization
which
has
been
developed
from
the
patriarchal
system
by
way
of
transformation
but
though
the
patriarchal
system
is
the
earliest
form
of
government
and
all
governments
have
been
developed
or
modified
from
it
the
right
of
government
to
govern
can
not
be
deduced
from
the
right
of
the
father
to
govern
his
children
for
the
parental
right
itself
is
not
ultimate
or
complete
all
governments
that
assume
it
to
be
so
and
rest
on
it
as
the
foundation
of
their
authority
are
barbaric
or
despotic
and
therefore
without
any
legitimate
authority
the
right
to
govern
rests
on
ownership
or
dominion
where
there
is
no
proprietorship
there
is
no
dominion
and
where
there
is
no
dominion
there
is
no
right
to
govern
only
he
who
is
sovereign
proprietor
is
sovereign
lord
property
ownership
dominion
rests
on
creation
the
maker
has
the
right
to
the
thing
made
he
so
far
as
he
is
sole
creator
is
sole
proprietor
and
may
do
what
he
will
with
it
god
is
sovereign
lord
and
proprietor
of
the
universe
because
he
is
its
sole
creator
he
hath
the
absolute
dominion
because
he
is
absolute
maker
he
has
made
it
he
owns
it
and
one
may
do
what
he
will
with
his
own
his
dominion
is
absolute
because
he
is
absolute
creator
and
he
rightly
governs
as
absolute
and
universal
lord
yet
is
he
no
despot
because
he
exercises
only
his
sovereign
right
and
his
own
essential
wisdom
goodness
justness
rectitude
and
immutability
are
the
highest
of
all
conceivable
guaranties
that
his
exercise
of
his
power
will
always
be
right
wise
just
and
good
the
despot
is
a
man
attempting
to
be
god
upon
earth
and
to
exercise
a
usurped
power
despotism
is
based
on
the
parental
right
and
the
parental
right
is
assumed
to
be
absolute
hence
your
despotic
rulers
claim
to
reign
and
to
be
loved
and
worshipped
as
gods
even
the
roman
emperors
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
were
addressed
as
divinities
and
theodosius
the
great
a
christian
was
addressed
as
your
eternity
eternitas
vestras
so
far
did
barbarism
encroach
on
civilization
even
under
christian
emperors
the
right
of
the
father
over
his
child
is
an
imperfect
right
for
he
is
the
generator
not
the
creator
of
his
child
generation
is
in
the
order
of
second
causes
and
is
simply
the
development
or
explication
of
the
race
the
early
roman
law
founded
on
the
confusion
of
generation
with
creation
gave
the
father
absolute
authority
over
the
child
the
right
of
life
and
death
as
over
his
servants
or
slaves
but
this
was
restricted
under
the
empire
and
in
all
christian
nations
the
authority
of
the
father
is
treated
like
all
power
as
a
trust
the
child
like
the
father
himself
belongs
to
the
state
and
to
the
state
the
father
is
answerable
for
the
use
he
makes
of
his
authority
the
law
fixes
the
age
of
majority
when
the
child
is
completely
emancipated
and
even
during
his
nonage
takes
him
from
the
father
and
places
him
under
guardians
in
case
the
father
is
incompetent
to
fulfil
or
grossly
abuses
his
trust
this
is
proper
because
society
contributes
to
the
life
of
the
child
and
has
a
right
as
well
as
an
interest
in
him
society
again
must
suffer
if
the
child
is
allowed
to
grow
up
a
worthless
vagabond
or
a
criminal
and
has
a
right
to
intervene
both
in
behalf
of
itself
and
of
the
child
in
case
his
parents
neglect
to
train
him
up
in
the
nurture
and
admonition
of
the
lord
or
are
training
him
up
to
be
a
liar
a
thief
a
drunkard
a
murderer
a
pest
to
the
community
how
then
base
the
right
of
society
on
the
right
of
the
father
since
in
point
of
fact
the
right
of
society
is
paramount
to
the
right
of
the
parent
but
even
waiving
this
and
granting
what
is
not
the
fact
that
the
authority
of
the
father
is
absolute
unlimited
it
can
not
be
the
ground
of
the
right
of
society
to
govern
assume
the
parental
right
to
be
perfect
and
inseparable
from
the
parental
relation
it
is
no
right
to
govern
where
no
such
relation
exists
nothing
true
real
solid
in
government
can
be
founded
on
what
carlyle
calls
a
sham
the
statesman
if
worthy
of
the
name
ascertains
and
conforms
to
the
realities
the
verities
of
things
and
all
jurisprudence
that

origin
of

continued
ii
rejecting
the
patriarchal
theory
as
untenable
and
shrinking
from
asserting
the
divine
origin
of
government
lest
they
should
favor
theocracy
and
place
secular
society
under
the
control
of
the
clergy
and
thus
disfranchise
the
laity
modern
political
writers
have
sought
to
render
government
purely
human
and
maintain
that
its
origin
is
conventional
and
that
it
is
founded
in
compact
or
agreement
their
theory
originated
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
was
predominant
in
the
last
century
and
the
first
third
of
the
present
it
has
been
and
perhaps
is
yet
generally
accepted
by
american
politicians
and
statesmen
at
least
so
far
as
they
ever
trouble
their
heads
with
the
question
at
all
which
it
must
be
confessed
is
not
far
the
moral
theologians
of
the
church
have
generally
spoken
of
government
as
a
social
pact
or
compact
and
explained
the
reciprocal
rights
and
obligations
of
subjects
and
rulers
by
the
general
law
of
contracts
but
they
have
never
held
that
government
originates
in
a
voluntary
agreement
between
the
people
and
their
rulers
or
between
the
several
individuals
composing
the
community
they
have
never
held
that
government
has
only
a
conventional
origin
or
authority
they
have
simply
meant
by
the
social
compact
the
mutual
relations
and
reciprocal
rights
and
duties
of
princes
and
their
subjects
as
implied
in
the
very
existence
and
nature
of
civil
society
where
there
are
rights
and
duties
on
each
side
they
treat
the
fact
not
as
an
agreement
voluntarily
entered
into
and
which
creates
them
but
as
a
compact
which
binds
alike
sovereign
and
subject
and
in
determining
whether
either
side
has
sinned
or
not
they
inquire
whether
either
has
broken
the
terms
of
the
social
compact
they
were
engaged
not
with
the
question
whence
does
government
derive
its
authority
but
with
its
nature
and
the
reciprocal
rights
and
duties
of
governors
and
the
governed
the
compact
itself
they
held
was
not
voluntarily
formed
by
the
people
themselves
either
individually
or
collectively
but
was
imposed
by
god
either
immediately
or
mediately
through
the
law
of
nature
every
man
says
cicero
is
born
in
society
and
remains
there
they
held
the
same
and
maintained
that
every
one
born
into
society
contracts
by
that
fact
certain
obligations
to
society
and
society
certain
obligations
to
him
for
under
the
natural
law
every
one
has
certain
rights
as
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
and
owes
certain
duties
to
society
for
the
protection
and
assistance
it
affords
him
but
modern
political
theorists
have
abused
the
phrase
borrowed
from
the
theologians
and
made
it
cover
a
political
doctrine
which
they
would
have
been
the
last
to
accept
these
theorists
or
political
speculators
have
imagined
a
state
of
nature
antecedently
to
civil
society
in
which
men
lived
without
government
law
or
manners
out
of
which
they
finally
came
by
entering
into
a
voluntary
agreement
with
some
one
of
their
number
to
be
king
and
to
govern
them
or
with
one
another
to
submit
to
the
rule
of
the
majority
hobbes
the
english
materialist
is
among
the
earliest
and
most
distinguished
of
the
advocates
of
this
theory
he
held
that
men
lived
prior
to
the
creation
of
civil
society
in
a
state
of
nature
in
which
all
were
equal
and
every
one
had
an
equal
right
to
every
thing
and
to
take
any
thing
on
which
he
could
lay
his
hands
and
was
strong
enough
to
hold
there
was
no
law
but
the
will
of
the
strongest
hence
the
state
of
nature
was
a
state
of
continual
war
at
length
wearied
and
disgusted
men
sighed
for
peace
and
with
one
accord
said
to
the
tallest
bravest
or
ablest
among
them
come
be
our
king
our
master
our
sovereign
lord
and
govern
us
we
surrender
our
natural
rights
and
our
natural
independence
to
you
with
no
other
reserve
or
condition
than
that
you
maintain
peace
among
us
keep
us
from
robbing
and
plundering
one
another
or
cutting
each
other
throats
locke
followed
hobbes
and
asserted
virtually
the
same
theory
but
asserted
it
in
the
interests
of
liberty
as
hobbes
had
asserted
it
in
the
interests
of
power
rousseau
a
citizen
of
geneva
followed
in
the
next
century
with
his
contrat
social
the
of
the
french
revolutionists
almost
their
bible
and
put
the
finishing
stroke
to
the
theory
hitherto
the
compact
or
agreement
had
been
assumed
to
be
between
the
governor
and
the
governed
rousseau
supposes
it
to
be
between
the
people
themselves
or
a
compact
to
which
the
people
are
the
only
parties
he
adopts
the
theory
of
a
state
of
nature
in
which
men
lived
antecedently
to
their
forming
themselves
into
civil
society
without
government
or
law
all
men
in
that
state
were
equal
and
each
was
independent
and
sovereign
proprietor
of
himself
these
equal
independent
sovereign
individuals
met
or
are
held
to
have
met
in
convention
and
entered
into
a
compact
with
themselves
each
with
all
and
all
with
each
that
they
would
constitute
government
and
would
each
submit
to
the
determination
and
authority
of
the
whole
practically
of
the
fluctuating
and
irresponsible
majority
civil
society
the
state
the
government
originates
in
this
compact
and
the
government
as
jefferson
asserts
in
the
declaration
of
american
independence
derives
its
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
this
theory
as
so
set
forth
or
as
modified
by
asserting
that
the
individual
delegates
instead
of
surrendering
his
rights
to
civil
society
was
generally
adopted
by
the
american
people
in
the
last
century
and
is
still
the
more
prevalent
theory
with
those
among
them
who
happen
to
have
any
theory
or
opinion
on
the
subject
it
is
the
political
tradition
of
the
country
the
state
as
defined
by
the
elder
adams
is
held
to
be
a
voluntary
association
of
individuals
individuals
create
civil
society
and
may
uncreate
it
whenever
they
judge
it
advisable
prior
to
the
southern
rebellion
nearly
every
american
asserted
with
lafayette
the
sacred
right
of
insurrection
or
revolution
and
sympathized
with
insurrectionists
rebels
and
revolutionists
wherever
they
made
their
appearance
loyalty
was
held
to
be
the
correlative
of
royalty
treason
was
regarded
as
a
virtue
and
traitors
were
honored
feasted
and
eulogized
as
patriots
ardent
lovers
of
liberty
and
champions
of
the
people
the
fearful
struggle
of
the
nation
against
a
rebellion
which
threatened
its
very
existence
may
have
changed
this
that
there
is
or
ever
was
a
state
of
nature
such
as
the
theory
assumes
may
be
questioned
certainly
nothing
proves
that
it
is
or
ever
was
a
real
state
that
there
is
a
law
of
nature
is
undeniable
all
authorities
in
philosophy
morals
politics
and
jurisprudence
assert
it
the
state
assumes
it
as
its
own
immediate
basis
and
the
codes
of
all
nations
are
founded
on
it
universal
jurisprudence
the
jus
qentium
of
the
romans
embodies
it
and
the
courts
recognize
and
administer
it
it
is
the
reason
and
conscience
of
civil
society
and
every
state
acknowledges
its
authority
but
the
law
of
nature
is
as
much
in
force
in
civil
society
as
out
of
it
civil
law
does
not
abrogate
or
supersede
natural
law
but
presupposes
it
and
supports
itself
on
it
as
its
own
ground
and
reason
as
the
natural
law
which
is
only
natural
justice
and
equity
dictated
by
the
reason
common
to
all
men
persists
in
the
civil
law
municipal
or
international
as
its
informing
soul
so
does
the
state
of
nature
persist
in
the
civil
state
natural
society
in
civil
society
which
simply
develops
applies
and
protects
it
man
in
civil
society
is
not
out
of
nature
but
is
in
it
is
in
his
most
natural
state
for
society
is
natural
to
him
and
government
is
natural
to
society
and
in
some
form
inseparable
from
it
the
state
of
nature
under
the
natural
law
is
not
as
a
separate
state
an
actual
state
and
never
was
but
an
abstraction
in
which
is
considered
apart
from
the
concrete
existence
called
society
what
is
derived
immediately
from
the
natural
law
but
as
abstractions
have
no
existence
out
of
the
mind
that
forms
them
the
state
of
nature
has
no
actual
existence
in
the
world
of
reality
as
a
separate
state
but
suppose
with
the
theory
the
state
of
nature
to
have
been
a
real
and
separate
state
in
which
men
at
first
lived
there
is
great
difficulty
in
understanding
how
they
ever
got
out
of
it
can
a
man
divest
himself
of
his
nature
or
lift
himself
above
it
man
is
in
his
nature
and
inseparable
from
it
if
his
primitive
state
was
his
natural
state
and
if
the
political
state
is
supernatural
preternatural
or
subnatural
how
passed
he
alone
by
his
own
unaided
powers
from
the
former
to
the
latter
the
ancients
who
had
lost
the
primitive
tradition
of
creation
asserted
indeed
the
primitive
man
as
springing
from
the
earth
and
leading
a
mere
animal
life
living
in
eaves
or
hollow
trees
and
feeding
on
roots
and
nuts
without
speech
without
science
art
law
or
sense
of
right
and
wrong
but
prior
to
the
prevalence
of
the
epicurean
philosophy
they
never
pretended
that
man
could
come
out
of
that
state
alone
by
his
own
unaided
efforts
they
ascribed
the
invention
of
language
art
and
science
the
institution
of
civil
society
government
and
laws
to
the
intervention
of
the
gods
it
remained
for
the
epicureans
who
though
unable
like
their
modern
successors
the
positivists
or
developmentists
to
believe
in
a
first
cause
believed
in
effects
without
causes
or
that
things
make
or
take
care
of
themselves
to
assert
that
men
could
by
their
own
unassisted
efforts
or
by
the
simple
exercise
of
reason
come
out
of
the
primitive
state
and
institute
what
in
modern
times
is
called
civilta
civility
or
civilization
the
partisans
of
this
theory
of
the
state
of
nature
from
which
men
have
emerged
by
the
voluntary
and
deliberate
formation
of
civil
society
forget
that
if
government
is
not
the
sole
condition
it
is
one
of
the
essential
conditions
of
progress
the
only
progressive
nations
are
civilized
or
republican
nations
savage
and
barbarous
tribes
are
unprogressive
ages
on
ages
roll
over
them
without
changing
any
thing
in
their
state
and
niebuhr
has
well
remarked
with
others
that
history
records
no
instance
of
a
savage
tribe
or
people
having
become
civilized
by
its
own
spontaneous
or
indigenous
efforts
if
savage
tribes
have
ever
become
civilized
it
has
been
by
influences
from
abroad
by
the
aid
of
men
already
civilized
through
conquest
colonies
or
missionaries
never
by
their
own
indigenous
efforts
nor
even
by
commerce
as
is
so
confidently
asserted
in
this
mercantile
age
nothing
in
all
history
indicates
the
ability
of
a
savage
people
to
pass
of
itself
from
the
savage
state
to
the
civilized
but
the
primitive
man
as
described
by
horace
in
his
satires
and
asserted
by
hobbes
locke
rousseau
and
others
is
far
below
the
savage
the
lowest
most
degraded
and
most
debased
savage
tribe
that
has
yet
been
discovered
has
at
least
some
rude
outlines
or
feeble
reminiscences
of
a
social
state
of
government
morals
law
and
religion
for
even
in
superstition
the
most
gross
there
is
a
reminiscence
of
true
religion
but
the
people
in
the
alleged
state
of
nature
have
none
the
advocates
of
the
theory
deceive
themselves
by
transporting
into
their
imaginary
state
of
nature
the
views
habits
and
capacities
of
the
civilized
man
it
is
perhaps
not
difficult
for
men
who
have
been
civilized
who
have
the
intelligence
the
arts
the
affections
and
the
habits
of
civilization
if
deprived
by
some
great
social
convulsion
of
society
and
thrown
back
on
the
state
of
nature
or
cast
away
on
some
uninhabited
island
in
the
ocean
and
cut
off
from
all
intercourse
with
the
rest
of
mankind
to
reconstruct
civil
society
and
and
maintain
civil
government
they
are
civilized
men
and
bear
civil
society
in
their
own
life
but
these
are
no
representatives
of
the
primitive
man
in
the
alleged
state
of
nature
these
primitive
men
have
no
experience
no
knowledge
no
conception
even
of
civilized
life
or
of
any
state
superior
to
that
in
which
they
have
thus
far
lived
how
then
can
they
since
on
the
theory
civil
society
has
no
root
in
nature
but
is
a
purely
artificial
creation
even
conceive
of
civilization
much
less
realize
it
these
theorists
as
theorists
always
do
fail
to
make
a
complete
abstraction
of
the
civilized
state
and
conclude
from
what
they
feel
they
could
do
in
case
civil
society
were
broken
up
what
men
may
do
and
have
done
in
a
state
of
nature
men
can
not
divest
themselves
of
themselves
and
whatever
their
efforts
to
do
it
they
think
reason
and
act
as
they
are
every
writer
whatever
else
he
writes
writes
himself
the
advocates
of
the
theory
to
have
made
their
abstraction
complete
should
have
presented
their
primitive
man
as
below
the
lowest
known
savage
unprogressive
and
in
himself
incapable
of
developing
any
progressive
energy
unprogressive
and
without
foreign
assistance
incapable
of
progress
how
is
it
possible
for
your
primitive
man
to
pass
by
his
own
unassisted
efforts
from
the
alleged
state
of
nature
to
that
of
civilization
of
which
he
has
no
conception
and
towards
which
no
innate
desire
no
instinct
no
divine
inspiration
pushes
him
but
even
if
by
some
happy
inspiration
hardly
supposable
without
supernatural
intervention
repudiated
by
the
theory
if
by
some
happy
inspiration
a
rare
individual
should
so
far
rise
above
the
state
of
nature
as
to
conceive
of
civil
society
and
of
civil
government
how
could
he
carry
his
conception
into
execution
conception
is
always
easier
than
its
realization
and
between
the
design
and
its
execution
there
is
always
a
weary
distance
the
poetry
of
all
nations
is
a
wail
over
unrealized
ideals
it
is
little
that
even
the
wisest
and
most
potent
statesman
can
realize
of
what
he
conceives
to
be
necessary
for
the
state
political
legislative
or
judicial
reforms
even
when
loudly
demanded
and
favored
by
authority
are
hard
to
be
effected
and
not
seldom
generations
come
and
go
without
effecting
them
the
republics
of
plato
sir
thomas
more
campanella
harrington
as
the
communities
of
robert
owen
and
cabet
remain
utopias
not
solely
because
intrinsically
absurd
though
so
in
fact
but
chiefly
because
they
are
innovations
have
no
support
in
experience
and
require
for
their
realization
the
modes
of
thought
habits
manners
character
life
which
only
their
introduction
and
realization
can
supply
so
to
be
able
to
execute
the
design
of
passing
from
the
supposed
state
of
nature
to
civilization
the
reformer
would
need
the
intelligence
the
habits
and
characters
in
the
public
which
are
not
possible
without
civilization
itself
some
philosophers
suppose
men
have
invented
language
forgetting
that
it
requires

to
give
the

to
invent

men
are

moved
by

reasoning
however
clear
and
convincing
it
may
be
they
are
moved
by
their

routine
is
more
powerful
with
them
than
logic
a
few
are
greedy
of
novelties
and
are
always
for
trying
experiments
but
the
great
body
of
the
people
of
all
nations
have
an
invincible
repugnance
to
abandon
what
they
know
for
what
they

they
are
to

the

not
make
the

even
for

itself
is
powerless
before
their
indolence
prejudice

never
were
philosophers
more
ignorant
of

than
they
so
numerous
in
the
last

that

can
be

may
promise
can
be
successful
if
introduced
unless
it
has
its
root
or
germ
in
the
past
man
is
never
a
creator
he
can
only
develop
and
continue
because
he
is
himself
a
creature
and
only
a
second
cause
the
children
of
israel
when
they
encountered
the
privations
of
the
wilderness
that
lay
between
them
and
the
promised
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
fainted
in
spirit
and
begged
moses
to
lead
them
back
to
egypt
and
permit
them
to
return
to
slavery
in
the
alleged
state
of
nature
as
the
philosophers
describe
it
there
is
no
germ
of
civilization
and
the
transition
to
civil
society
would
not
be
a
development
but
a
complete
rupture
with
the
past
and
an
entire
new
creation
when
it
is
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
necessary
reforms
are
introduced
in
old
and
highly
civilized
nations
and
when
it
can
seldom
be
done
at
all
without
terrible
political
and
social
convulsions
how
can
we
suppose
men
without
society
and
knowing
nothing
of
it
can
deliberately
and
as
it
were
with
malice
aforethought
found
society
without
government
and
destitute
alike
of
habits
of
obedience
and
habits
of
command
how
can
they
initiate
establish
and
sustain
government
to
suppose
it
would
be
to
suppose
that
men
in
a
state
of
nature
without
culture
without
science
without
any
of
the
arts
even
the
most
simple
and
necessary
are
infinitely
superior
to
the
men
formed
under
the
most
advanced
civilization
was
rousseau
right
in
asserting
civilization
as
a
fall
as
a
deterioration
of
the
race
but
suppose
the
state
of
nature
even
suppose
that
men
by
some
miracle
or
other
can
get
out
of
it
and
found
civil
society
the
origin
of
government
as
authority
in
compact
is
not
yet
established
according
to
the
theory
the
rights
of
civil
society
are
derived
from
the
rights
of
the
individuals
who
form
or
enter
into
the
compact
but
individuals
can
not
give
what
they
have
not
and
no
individual
has
in
himself
the
right
to
govern
another
by
the
law
of
nature
all
men
have
equal
rights
are
equals
and
equals
have
no
authority
one
over
another
nor
has
an
individual
the
sovereign
right
even
to
himself
or
the
right
to
dispose
of
himself
as
he
pleases
man
is
not
god
independent
and
he
is
dependent
and
dependent
not
only
on
his
maker
but
on
his
on
society
and
even
on
nature
or
the
material
world
that
on
which
he
depends
in
the
measure
in
which
be
depends
on
it
contributes
to
his
existence
to
his
life
and
to
his
and
has
by
virtue
of
its
contribution
a
right
in
him
and
to
him
and
hence
it
is
that
nothing
is
more
painful
to
the
proud
spirit
than
to
receive
a
favor
that
lays
him
under
an
obligation
to
another
the
right
of
that
on
which
man
depends
and
by
communion
with
which
he
lives
limits
his
own
right
over
himself
man
does
not
depend
exclusively
on
society
for
it
is
not
his
only
medium
of
communion
with
god
and
therefore
its
right
to
him
is
neither
absolute
nor
unlimited
but
still
be
depends
on
it
lives
in
it
and
can
not
live
without
it
it
has
then
certain
lights
over
him
and
he
can
not
enter
into
any
compact
league
or
alliance
that
society
does
not
authorize
or
at
least
permit
these
rights
of
society
override
his
rights
to
himself
and
he
can
neither
surrender
them
nor
delegate
them
other
rights
as
the
rights
of
religion
and
property
which
are
held
directly
from
god
and
nature
and
which
are
independent
of
society
are
included
in
what
are
called
the
natural
rights
of
man
and
these
rights
can
not
be
surrendered
in
forming
civil
society
for
they
are
rights
of
man
only
before
civil
society
and
therefore
not
his
to
cede
and
because
they
are
precisely
the
rights
that
government
is
bound
to
respect
and
protect
the
compact
then
can
not
be
formed
as
pretended
for
the
only
rights
individuals
could
delegate
or
surrender
to
society
to
constitute
the
sum
of
the
rights
of
government
are
hers
already
and
those
which
are
not
hers
are
those
which
can
not
be
delegated
or
surrendered
and
in
the
free
and
full
enjoyment
of
which
it
is
the
duty
the
chief
end
of
government
to
protect
each
and
every
individual
the
convention
not
only
is
not
a
fact
but
individuals
have
no
authority
without
society
to
meet
in
convention
and
enter
into
the
alleged
compact
because
they
are
not
independent
sovereign
individuals
but
pass
over
this
suppose
the
convention
suppose
the
compact
it
must
still
be
conceded
that
it
binds
and
can
bind
only
those
who
voluntarily
and
deliberately
enter
into
it
this
is
conceded
by
jefferson
and
the
american
congress
of
in
the
assertion
that
government
derives
its
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
this
consent
as
the
matter
is
one
of
life
and
death
must
be
free
deliberate
formal
explicit
not
simply
an
assumed
implied
or
constructive
consent
it
must
be
given
personally
and
not
by
one
for
another
without
his
express
authority
it
is
usual
to
infer
the
consent
or
the
acceptance
of
the
terms
of
the
compact
from
the
silence
of
the
individual
and
also
from
his
continued
residence
in
the
country
and
submission
to
its
government
but
residence
is
no
evidence
of
consent
because
it
may
be
a
matter
of
necessity
the
individual
may
be
unable
to
emigrate
if
he
would
and
by
what
right
can
individuals
form
an
agreement
to
which
i
must
consent
or
else
migrate
to
some
strange
land
can
my
consent
under
such
circumstances
even
if
given
be
any
thing
but
a
forced
consent
a
consent
given
under
duress
and
therefore
invalid
nothing
can
be
inferred
from
one
silence
for
he
may
have
many
reasons
for
being
silent
besides
approval
of
the
government
he
may
be
silent
because
speech
would
avail
nothing
because
to
protest
might
be
dangerous
cost
him
his
liberty
if
not
his
life
because
he
sees
and
knows
nothing
better
and
is
ignorant
that
he
has
any
choice
in
the
case
or
because
as
very
likely
is
the
fact
with
the
majority
he
has
never
for
moment
thought
of
the
matter
or
ever
had
his
attention
called
to
it
and
has
no
mind
on
the
subject
but
however
this
may
be
there
certainly
must
be
excluded
from
the
compact
or
obligation
to
obey
the
government
created
by
it
all
the
women
of
a
nation
all
the
children
too
young
to
be
capable
of
giving
their
consent
and
all
who
are
too
ignorant
too
weak
of
mind
to
be
able
to
understand
the
terms
of
the
contract
these
several
classes
can
not
be
less
than
of
the
population
of
any
country
what
is
to
be
done
with
them
leave
them
without
government
extend
the
power
of
the
government
over
them
by
what
right
government
derives
its
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
and
that
consent
they
have
not
given
whence
does
of
the
population
get
its
right
to
govern
the
other
but
what
is
to
be
done
with
the
rights
of
minorities
is
the
rule
of
unanimity
to
be
insisted
on
in
the
convention
and
in
the
government
when
it
goes
into
operation
unanimity
is
impracticable
for
where
there
are
many
men
there
will
be
differences
of
opinion
the
rule
of
unanimity
gives
to
each
individual
a
veto
on
the
whole
proceeding
which
was
the
grand
defect
of
the
polish
constitution
each
member
of
the
polish
diet
which
included
the
whole
body
of
the
nobility
had
an
absolute
veto
and
could
alone
arrest
the
whole
action
of
the
government
will
you
substitute
the
rule
of
the
majority
and
say
the
majority
must
govern
by
what
right
it
is
agreed
to
in
the
convention
unanimously
or
only
by
a
majority
the
right
of
the
majority
to
have
their
will
is
on
the
social
compact
theory
a
conventional
right
and
therefore
can
not
come
into
play
before
the
convention
is
completed
or
the
social
compact
is
framed
and
accepted
how
in
settling
the
terms
of
the
compact
will
you
proceed
by
majorities
but
suppose
a
minority
objects
and
demands
or
and
votes
against
the
majority
rule
which
is
carried
only
by
a
simple
plurality
of
votes
will
the
proceedings
of
the
convention
bind
the
dissenting
minority
what
gives
to
the
majority
the
right
to
govern
the
minority
who
dissent
from
its
action
on
the
supposition
that
society
has
rights
not
derived
from
individuals
and
which
are
intrusted
to
the
government
there
is
a
good
reason
why
the
majority
should
prevail
within
the
legitimate
sphere
of
government
because
the
majority
is
the
best
representative
practicable
of
society
itself
and
if
the
constitution
secures
to
minorities
and
dissenting
individuals
their
natural
rights
and
their
equal
rights
as
citizens
they
have
no
just
cause
of
complaint
for
the
majority
in
such
case
has
no
power
to
tyrannize
over
them
or
to
oppress
them
but
the
theory
under
examination
denies
that
society
has
any
rights
except
such
as
it
derives
from
individuals
who
all
have
equal
rights
according
to
it
society
is
itself
conventional
and
created
by
free
independent
equal
sovereign
individuals
society
is
a
congress
of
sovereigns
in
which
no
one
has
authority
over
another
and
no
one
can
be
rightfully
forced
to
submit
to
any
decree
against
his
will
in
such
a
congress
the
rule
of
the
majority
is
manifestly
improper
illegitimate
and
invalid
unless
adopted
by
unanimous
consent
but
this
is
not
all
the
individual
is
always
the
equal
of
himself
and
if
the
government
derives
its
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
he
governs
in
the
government
and
parts
with
none
of
his
original
sovereignty
the
government
is
not
his
master
but
his
agent
as
the
principal
only
delegates
not
surrenders
his
rights
and
powers
to
the
agent
he
is
free
at
any
time
he
pleases
to
recall
the
powers
he
has
delegated
to
give
new
instructions
or
to
dismiss
him
the
sovereignty
of
the
individual
survives
the
compact
and
persists
through
all
the
acts
of
his
agent
the
government
he
must
then
be
free
to
withdraw
from
the
compact
whenever
he
judges
it
advisable
secession
is
perfectly
legitimate
if
government
is
simply
a
contract
between
equals
the
disaffected
the
criminal
the
thief
the
government
would
send
to
prison
or
the
murderer
it
would
hang
would
be
very
likely
to
revoke
his
consent
and
to
secede
from
the
state
any
number
of
individuals
large
enough
to
count
a
majority
among
themselves
indisposed
to
pay
the
government
taxes
or
to
perform
the
military
service
exacted
might
hold
a
convention
adopt
a
secession
ordinance
and
declare
themselves
a
free
independent
sovereign
state
and
bid
defiance
to
the
and
the
and
that
too
without
forfeiting
their
estates
or
changing
their
domicile
would
the
government
employ
military
force
to
coerce
them
back
to
their
allegiance
by
what
right
government
is
their
agent
their
creature
and
no
man
owes
allegiance
to
his
own
agent
or
creature
the
compact
could
bind
only
temporarily
and
could
at
any
moment
be
dissolved
jefferson
saw
this
and
very
consistently
maintained
that
one
generation
has
no
power
to
bind
another
and
as
if
this
was
not
enough
he
asserted
the
right
of
revolution
and
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
in
every
nation
a
revolution
once
in
every
generation
is
desirable
that
is
according
to
his
reckoning
once
every
nineteen
years
the
doctrine
that
one
generation
has
no
power
to
bind
its
successor
is
not
only
a
logical
conclusion
from
the
theory
that
governments
derive
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
since
a
generation
can
not
give
its
consent
before
it
is
born
but
is
very
convenient
for
a
nation
that
has
contracted
a
large
national
debt
yet
perhaps
not
so
convenient
to
the
public
creditor
since
the
new
generation
may
take
it
into
its
head
not
to
assume
or
discharge
the
obligations
of
its
predecessor
but
to
repudiate
them
no
man
certainly
can
contract
for
any
one
but
himself
and
how
then
can
the
son
be
bound
without
his
own
personal
or
individual
consent
freely
given
by
the
obligations
entered
into
by
his
father
the
social
compact
is
necessarily
limited
to
the
individuals
who
form
it
and
as
necessarily
unless
renewed
expires
with
them
it
thus
creates
no
state
no
political
corporation
which
survives
in
all
its
rights
and
powers
though
individuals
die
the
state
is
on
this
theory
a
voluntary
association
and
in
principle
except
that
it
is
not
a
secret
society
in
no
respect
differs
from
the
carbonari
or
the
knights
of
the
golden
circle
when
orsini
attempted
to
execute
the
sentence
of
death
on
the
emperor
of
the
french
in
obedience
to
the
order
of
the
carbonari
of
which
the
emperor
was
a
member
he
was
if
the
theory
of
the
origin
of
government
in
compact
be
true
no
more
an
assassin
than
was
the
officer
who
executed
on
the
gallows
the
rebel
spies
and
incendiaries
beal
and
kennedy
certain
it
is
that
the
alleged
social
compact
has
in
it
no
social
or
civil
element
it
does
not
and
can
not
create
society
it
can
give
only
an
aggregation
of
individuals
and
society
is
not
an
aggregation
nor
even
an
organization
of
individuals
it
is
an
organism
and
individuals
live
in
its
life
as
well
as
it
in
theirs
there
is
a
real
living
solidarity
which
makes
individuals
members
of
the
social
body
and
members
one
of
another
there
is
no
society
without
individuals
and
there
are
no
individuals
without
society
but
in
society
there
is
that
which
is
not
individual
and
is
more
than
all
individuals
the
social
compact
is
an
attempt
to
substitute
for
this
real
living
solidarity
which
gives
to
society
at
once
unity
of
life
and
diversity
of
members
an
artificial
solidarity
a
fictitious
unity
for
a
real
unity
and
membership
by
contract
for
real
living
membership
a
cork
leg
for
that
which
nature
herself
gives
real
government
has
its
ground
in
this
real
living
solidarity
and
represents
the
social
element
which
is
not
individual
but
above
all
individuals
as
man
is
above
men
but
the
theory
substitutes
a
simple
agency
for
government
and
makes
each
individual
its
principal
it
is
an
abuse
of
language
to
call
this
agency
a
government
it
has
no
one
feature
or
element
of
government
it
has
only
an
artificial
unity
based
on
diversity
its
authority
is
only
personal
individual
and
in
no
sense
a
public
authority
representing
a
public
will
a
public
right
or
a
public
interest
in
no
country
could
government
be
adopted
and
sustained
if
men
were
left
to
the
wisdom
or
justness
of
their
theories
or
in
the
general
affairs
of
life
acted
on
them
society
and
government
as
representing
society
has
a
real
existence
life
faculties
and
organs
of
its
own
not
derived
or
derivable
from
individuals
as
well
might
it
be
maintained
that
the
human
body
consists
in
and
derives
all
its
life
from
the
particles
of
matter
it
assimilates
from
its
food
and
which
are
constantly
escaping
as
to
maintain
that
society
derives
its
life
or
government
its
powers
from
individuals
no
mechanical
aggregation
of
brute
matter
can
make
a
living
body
if
there
is
no
living
and
assimilating
principle
within
and
no
aggregation
of
individuals
however
closely
bound
together
by
pacts
or
oaths
can
make
society
where
there
is
no
informing
social
principle
that
aggregates
and
assimilates
them
to
a
living
body
or
produce
that
mystic
existence
called
a
state
or
commonwealth
the
origin
of
government
in
the
contrat
social
supposes
the
nation
to
be
a
purely
personal
affair
it
gives
the
government
no
territorial
status
and
clothes
it
with
no
territorial
rights
or
jurisdiction
the
government
that
could
so
originate
would
be
if
any
thing
a
barbaric
not
a
republican
government
it
has
only
the
rights
conferred
on
it
surrendered
or
delegated
to
it
by
individuals
and
therefore
at
best
only
individual
rights
individuals
can
confer
only
such
rights
as
they
have
in
the
supposed
state
of
nature
in
that
state
there
is
neither
private
nor
public
domain
the
earth
in
that
state
is
not
property
and
is
open
to
the
first
occupant
and
the
occupant
can
lay
no

then
does

derive

its
right
of

claimed
by
all
national
governments

its

how
does
any

fix

obtain
the

to
prescribe
who

on
what

the

it
get
its

of

and
the

as

here
are

that
it

not
have
derived
from

for
individuals
never

them

the
concocters
of

evidently
overlooked
these

or
considered
them
of
no

they
seem
never
to
have
contemplated
the
existence
of
territorial

or
the
division
of
mankind
into
nations
fixed
to
the

they
seem
not
to
have
supposed
the

could
be
appropriated
and
indeed
many
of
their
followers
pretend
that
it
can
not
be
and
that
the
public

of
a

are
open

whoso
chooses
may
occupy
them

yet
mankind
are
divided

all
civilized

are
fixed
to

from
which
all
private

hold
their

proprietors
hold

it
retains
in

the
eminent

and
prohibits
the
alienation
of

it
defends
its
domain
its
public
unoccupied

and
the

owned
by
private
individuals
against
all
foreign
powers
now
whence
if
government
has
only
the
rights
ceded
it
by

does
it
get
this
domain
and
hold
the
right
to
treat
settlers
on
even
its
unoccupied

as
trespassers
in
the

the
territorial

of

they
have
are

with
their

and
in

to
what
they
hold
from
the

therefore
the
right
as
held
and
defended
by
all
nations
and
without
which
the
nation
has
no
status
no
fixed
dwelling
and
is
and
can
be
no

could
never
have
been
derived

the

the

the

did

whence
does

the
tendency
of
the

was
to

that
of

to

the

of

locke
rousseau

though
not

abandoned

by

has

sovereignty
it
is
now

is
inherent
in
the
people
not
individually
indeed
but
collectively
or
the
people
as

the

is
held
not
to
be
simply
a
compact
or
agreement
entered
into
by
the
people
as
individuals
creating
civil
society
and
government
but
a
law
ordained
by
the
sovereign
people
prescribing
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
defining
its
rights
and
powers
this
transformation
which
is
rather
going
on
than
completed
is
under
one
aspect
at
least
a
progress
or
rather
a
return
to
the
sounder
principles
of
antiquity
under
it
government
ceases
to
be
a
mere
agency
which
must
obtain
the
assassin
consent
to
be
hung
before
it
can
rightfully
hang
him
and
becomes
authority
which
is
one
and
imperative
the
people
taken
collectively
are
society
and
society
is
a
living
organism
not
a
mere
aggregation
of
individuals
it
does
not
of
course
exist
without
individuals
but
it
is
something
more
than
individuals
and
has
rights
not
derived
from
them
and
which
are
paramount
to
theirs
there
is
more
truth
and
truth
of
a
higher
order
in
this
than
in
the
theory
of
the
social
compact
individuals
to
a
certain
extent
derive
their
life
from
god
through
society
and
so
far
they
depend
on
her
and
they
are
hers
she
owns
them
and
has
the
right
to
do
as
she
will
with
them
on
this
theory
the
state
emanates
from
society
and
is
supreme
it
coincides
with
the
ancient
greek
and
roman
theory
as
expressed
by
cicero
already
cited
man
is
born
in
society
and
remains
there
and
it
may
be
regarded
as
the
source
of
ancient
greek
and
roman
patriotism
which
still
commands
the
admiration
of
the
civilized
world
the
state
with
greece
and
rome
was
a
living
reality
and
loyalty
a
religion
the
romans
held
rome
to
be
a
divinity
gave
her
statues
and
altars
and
offered
her
divine
worship
this
was
superstition
no
doubt
but
it
had
in
it
an
element
of
truth
to
every
true
philosopher
there
is
something
divine
in
the
state
and
truth
in
all
theories
society
stands
nearer
to
god
and
participates
more
immediately
of
the
divine
essence
and
the
state
is
a
more
lively
image
of
god
than
the
individual
it
was
man
the
generic
and
reproductive
man
not
the
isolated
individual
that
was
created
in
the
image
and
likeness
of
his
maker
and
god
created
man
in
his
own
image
in
the
image
of
god
created

this
theory
is
usually
called
the
democratic
theory
and
it
enlists
in
its
support
the
instincts
the
intelligence
the
living
forces
and
active
tendencies
of
the
age
kings
kaisers
and
hierarchies
are
powerless
before
it
and
war
against
it
in
vain
the
most
they
can
do
is
to
restrain
its
excesses
or
to
guard
against
its
abuses
its
advocates
in
returning
to
it
sometimes
revive
in
its
name
the
old
pagan
superstition
not
a
few
of
the
european
democrats
recognize
in
the
earth
in
heaven
or
in

no
power
superior
to
the
people
and
say
not

but
they
say
absolutely
without
any
qualification
the

of
the
people
is
the
voice
of
god

the
supreme

not

in

mazzini
said
when
at
the
head
of
the
roman
republic
in
the
question
of
religion
must
be
remitted
to
the
judgment
of
the
people
yet
this
theory
is
the
dominant
theory
of
the
age
and
is
in
all
civilized
nations
advancing
with
apparently
irresistible
force
but
this
theory
has
its
difficulties
who
are
the
collective
people
that
have
the
rights
of
society
or
who
are
the
sovereign
people
the
word
people
is
vague
and
in
itself
determines
nothing
it
may
include
a
larger
or
a
smaller
number
it
may
mean
the
political
people
or
it
may
mean
simply
population
it
may
mean
peasants
artisans
shopkeepers
traders
merchants
as
distinguished
from
the
nobility
hired
laborers
or
workmen
as
distinguished
from
their
employer
or
slaves
as
distinguished
from
their
master
or
owner
in
which
of
these
senses
is
the
word
to
be
taken
when
it
is
said
the
people
are
sovereign
the
people
are
the
population
or
inhabitants
of
one
and
the
same
country
that
is
something
but
who
or
what
determines
the
country
is
the
country
the
whole
territory
of
the
globe
that
will
not
be
said
especially
since
the
dispersion
of
mankind
and
their
division
into
separate
nations
is
the
territory
indefinite
or
undefined
then
indefinite
or
undefined
are
its
inhabitants
or
the
people
invested
with
the
rights
of
society
is
it
defined
and
its
boundaries
fixed
who
has
done
it
the
people
but
who
are
the
people
we
are
as
wise
as
we
were
at
starting
the
logicians
say
that
the
definition
of
idem
per
idem
or
the
same
by
the
same
is
simply
no
definition
at
all
the
people
are
the
nation
undoubtedly
if
you
mean
by
the
people
the
sovereign
people
but
who
are
the
people
constituting
the
nation
the
sovereign
people
this
is
only
to
revolve
in
a
vicious
circle
the
nation
is
the
tribe
or
the
people
living
under
the
same
regimen
and
born
of
the
same
ancestor
or
sprung
from
the
same
ancestor
or
progenitor
but
where
find
a
nation
in
this
the
primitive
sense
of
the
word
migration
conquest
and
intermarriage
have
so
broken
up
and
intermingled
the
primitive
races
that
it
is
more
than
doubtful
if
a
single
nation
tribe
or
family
of
unmixed
blood
now
exists
on
the
face
of
the
earth
a
frenchman
italian
spaniard
german
or
englishman
may
have
the
blood
of
a
hundred
different
races
coursing
in
his
veins
the
nation
is
the
people
inhabiting
the
same
country
and
united
under
one
and
the
same
government
it
is
further
answered
the
nation
then
is
not
purely
personal
but
also
territorial
then
again
the
question
comes
up
who
or
what
determines
the
territory
the
government
but
not
before
it
is
constituted
and
it
can
not
be
constituted
till
its
territorial
limits
are
determined
the
tribe
doubtless
occupies
territory
but
is
not
fixed
to
it
and
derives
no
jurisdiction
from
it
and
therefore
is
not
territorial
but
a
nation
in
the
modern
or
civilized
sense
is
fixed
to
the
territory
and
derives
from
it
its
jurisdiction
or
sovereignty
and
therefore
till
the
territory
is
determined
the
nation
is
not
and
can
not
be
determined
the
question
is
not
an
idle
question
it
is
one
of
great
practical
importance
for
till
it
is
settled
we
can
neither
determine
who
are
the
sovereign
people
nor
who
are
united
under
one
and
the
same
government
laws
have
no
force
and
the
officer
who
should
attempt
to
enforce
the
national
laws
beyond
the
national
territory
would
be
a
trespasser
if
the
limits
are
undetermined
the
government
is
not
territorial
and
can
claim
as
within
its
jurisdiction
only
those
who
choose
to
acknowledge
its
authority
the
importance
of
the
question
has
been
recently
brought
home
to
the
american
people
by
the
secession
of
eleven
or
more
states
from
the
union
were
these
states
a
part
of
the
american
nation
or
were
they
not
was
the
war
which
followed
secession
and
which
cost
so
many
lives
and
so
much
treasure
a
civil
war
or
a
foreign
war
were
the
secessionists
traitors
and
rebels
to
their
sovereign
or
were
they
patriots
fighting
for
the
liberty
and
independence
of
their
country
and
the
right
of
all
on
both
sides
agreed
that
the
nation
is
sovereign
the
dispute
was
as
to
the
existence
of
the
nation
itself
and
the
extent
of
its
jurisdiction
doubtless
when
a
nation
has
a
generally
recognized
existence
as
an
historical
fact
most
of
the
difficulties
in
determining
who
are
the
sovereign
people
can
be
got
over
but
the
question
here
concerns
the
institution
of
government
and
determining
who
constitute
society
and
have
the
right
to
meet
in
person
or
by
their
delegates
in
convention
to
institute
it
this
question
so
important
and
at
times
so
difficult
the
theory
of
the
origin
of
government
in
the
people
collectively
or
the
nation
does
not
solve
or
furnish
any
means
of
solving
but
suppose
this
difficulty
surmounted
there
is
still
another
and
a
very
grave
one
to
overcome
the
theory
assumes
that
the
people
collectively
in
their
own
native
right
and
might
are
sovereign
according
to
it
the
people
are
ultimate
and
free
to
do
whatever
they
please
this
sacrifices
individual
freedom
the
origin
of
government
in
a
compact
entered
into
by
individuals
each
with
all
and
all
with
each
sacrificed
the
rights
of
society
and
assumed
each
individual
to
be
in
himself
an
independent
sovereignty
if
logically
carried
out
there
could
be
no
such
crime
as
treason
there
could
be
no
state
and
no
public
authority
this
new
theory
transfers
to
society
the
sovereignty
which
that
asserted
for
the
individual
and
asserts
social
despotism
or
the
absolutism
of
the
state
it
asserts
with
sufficient
energy
public
authority
or
the
right
of
the
people
to
govern
but
it
leaves
no
space
for
individual
rights
which
society
must
recognize
respect
and
protect
this
was
the
grand
defect
of
the
ancient
civilization
the
historian
explores
in
vain
the
records
of
the
old
greek
and
roman
republics
for
any
recognition
of
the
rights
of
individuals
not
held
as
privileges
or
concessions
from
the
state
society
recognized
no
limit
to
her
authority
and
the
state
claimed
over
individuals
all
the
authority
of
the
patriarch
over
his
household
the
chief
over
his
tribe
or
the
absolute
monarch
over
his
subjects
the
direct
and
indirect
influence
of
the
body
of
freemen
admitted
to
a
voice
in
public
affairs
in
determining
the
resolutions
and
action
of
the
state
no
doubt
tempered
in
practice
to
some
extent
the
authority
of
the
state
and
prevented
acts
of
gross
oppression
but
in
theory
the
state
was
absolute
and
the
people
individually
were
placed
at
the
mercy
of
the
people
collectively
or
rather
the
majority
of
the
collective
people
under
ancient
republicanism
there
were
rights
of
the
state
and
rights
of
the
citizen
but
no
rights
of
man
held
independently
of
society
and
not
derived
from
god
through
the
state
the
recognition
of
these
rights
by
modern
society
is
due
to
christianity
some
say
to
the
barbarians
who
overthrew
the
roman
empire
but
this
last
opinion
is
not
well
founded
the
barbarian
chiefs
and
nobles
had
no
doubt
a
lively
sense
of
personal
freedom
and
independence
but
for
themselves
only
they
had
no
conception
of
personal
freedom
as
a
general
or
universal
right
and
men
never
obtain
universal
principles
by
generalizing
particulars
they
may
give
a
general
truth
a
particular
application
but
not
a
particular
truth
understood
to
be
a
particular
truth
a
general
or
universal
application
they
are
too
good
logicians
for
that
the
barbarian
individual
freedom
and
personal
independence
was
never
generalized
into
the
doctrine
of
the
rights
of
man
any
more
than
the
freedom
of
the
master
has
been
generalized
into
the
right
of
his
slaves
to
be
free
the
doctrine
of
individual
freedom
before
the
state
is
due
to
the
christian
religion
which
asserts
the
dignity
and
worth
of
every
human
soul
the
accountability
to
god
of
each
man
for
himself
and
lays
it
down
as
law
for
every
one
that
god
is
to
be
obeyed
rather
than
men
the
church
practically
denied
the
absolutism
of
the
state
and
asserted
for
every
man
rights
not
held
from
the
state
in
converting
the
empire
to
christianity
in
defiance
of
the
state
authority
and
the
imperial
edicts
punishing
with
death
the
profession
of
the
christian
faith
in
this
she
practically
as
well
as
theoretically
overthrew
state
absolutism
and
infused
into
modern
society
the
doctrine
that
every
individual
even
the
lowest
and
meanest
has
rights
which
the
state
neither
confers
nor
can
abrogate
and
it
will
only
be
by
extinguishing
in
modern
society
the
christian
faith
and
obliterating
all
traces
of
christian
civilization
that
state
absolutism
can
be
revived
with
more
than
a
partial
and
temporary
success
the
doctrine
of
individual
liberty
may
be
abused
and
so
explained
as
to
deny
the
rights
of
society
and
to
become
pure
individualism
but
no
political
system
that
runs
to
the
opposite
extreme
and
absorbs
the
individual
in
the
state
stands
the
least
chance
of
any
general
or
permanent
success
till
christianity
is
extinguished
yet
the
assertion
of
principles
which
logically
imply
state
absolutism
is
not
entirely
harmless
even
in
christian
countries
error
is
never
harmless
and
only
truth
can
give
a
solid
foundation
on
which
to
build
individualism
and
socialism
are
each
opposed
to
the
other
and
each
has
only
a
partial
truth
the
state
founded
on
either
can
not
stand
and
society
will
only
alternate
between
the
two
extremes
it
is
torn
by
a
revolution
in
favor
of
socialism
it
will
be
torn
by
another
in
favor
of
individualism
and
without
effecting
any
real
progress
by
either
revolution
real
progress
can
be
secured
only
by
recognizing
and
building
on
the
truth
not
as
it
exists
in
our
opinions
or
in
our
theories
but
as
it
exists
in
the
world
of
reality
and
independent
of
our
opinions
now
social
despotism
or
state
absolutism
is
not
based
on
truth
or
reality
society
has
certain
rights
over
individuals
for
she
is
a
medium
of
their
communion
with
god
or
through
which
they
derive
life
from
god
the
primal
source
of
all
life
but
she
is
not
the
only
medium
of
man
life
man
as
was
said
in
the
beginning
lives
by
communion
with
god
and
he
communes
with
god
in
the
creative
act
and
the
incarnation
through
his
kind
and
through
nature
this
threefold
communion
gives
rise
to
three
institutions
religion
or
the
church
society
or
the
state
and
property
the
life
that
man
derives
from
god
through
religion
and
property
is
not
derived
from
him
through
society
and
consequently
so
much
of
his
life
be
holds
independently
of
society
and
this
constitutes
his
rights
as
a
man
as
distinguished
from
his
rights
as
a
citizen
in
relation
to
society
as
not
held
from
god
through
her
these
are
termed
his
natural
rights
which
she
must
hold
inviolable
and
government
protect
for
every
one
whatever
his
complexion
or
his
social
position
these
rights
the
rights
of
conscience
and
the
rights
of
property
with
all
their
necessary
implications
are
limitations
of
the
rights
of
society
and
the
individual
has
the
right
to
plead
them
against
the
state
society
does
not
confer
them
and
it
can
not
take
them
away
for
they
are
at
least
as
sacred
and
as
fundamental
as
her
own
but
even
this
limitation
of
popular
sovereignty
is
not
all
the
people
can
be
sovereign
only
in
the
sense
in
which
they
exist
and
act
the
people
are
not
god
whatever
some
theorists
may
pretend
are
not
independent
and
they
are
as
dependent
collectively
as
individually
and
therefore
can
exist
and
act
only
as
second
cause
never
as
first
cause
they
can
then
even
in
the
limited
sphere
of
their
sovereignty
be
sovereign
only
in
a
secondary
sense
never
absolute
sovereign
in
their
own
independent
right
they
are
sovereign
only
to
the
extent
to
which
they
impart
life
to
the
individual
members
of
society
and
only
in
the
sense
in
which
she
imparts
it
or
is
its
cause
she
is
not
its
first
cause
or
creator
and
is
the
medial
cause
or
medium
through
which
they
derive
it
from
god
not
its
efficient
cause
or
primary
source
society
derives
her
own
life
from
god
and
exists
and
acts
only
as
dependent
on
him
then
she
is
sovereign
over
individuals
only
as
dependent
on
god
her
dominion
is
then
not
original
and
absolute
but
secondary
and
derivative
this
third
theory
does
not
err
in
assuming
that
the
people
collectively
are
more
than
the
people
individually
or
in
denying
society
to
be
a
mere
aggregation
of
individuals
with
no
life
and
no
rights
but
what
it
derives
from
them
nor
even
in
asserting
that
the
people
in
the
sense
of
society
are
sovereign
but
in
asserting
that
they
are
sovereign
in
their
own
native
or
underived
right
and
might
society
has
not
in
herself
the
absolute
right
to
govern
because
she
has
not
the
absolute
dominion
either
of
herself
or
her
members
god
gave
to
man
dominion
over
the
irrational
creation
for
he
made
irrational
creatures
for
man
but
he
never
gave
him
either
individually
or
collectively
the
dominion
over
the
rational
creation
the
theory
that
the
people
are
absolutely
sovereign
in
their
own
independent
right
and
might
as
some
zealous
democrats
explain
it
asserts
the
fundamental
principle
of
despotism
and
all
despotism
is
false
for
it
identifies
the
creature
with
the
creator
no
creature
is
creator
or
has
the
rights
of
creator
and
consequently
no
one
in
his
own
right
is
or
can
be
sovereign
this
third
theory
therefore
is
untenable
iv
a
still
more
recent
class
of
philosophers
if
philosophers
they
may
be
called
reject
the
origin
of
government
in
the
people
individually
or
collectively
satisfied
that
it
has
never
been
instituted
by
a
voluntary
and
deliberate
act
of
the
people
and
confounding
government
as
a
fact
with
government
as
authority
maintain
that
government
is
a
spontaneous
development
of
nature
nature
develops
it
as
the
liver
secretes
bile
as
the
bee
constructs
her
cell
or
the
beaver
builds
his
dam
nature
working
by
her
own
laws
and
inherent
energy
develops
society
and
society
develops
government
that
is
all
the
secret
questions
as
to
the
origin
of
government
or
its
rights
beyond
the
simple
positive
fact
belong
to
the
theological
or
metaphysical
stage
of
the
development
of
nature
but
are
left
behind
when
the
race
has
passed
beyond
that
stage
and
has
reached
the
epoch
of
positive
science
in
which
all
except
the
positive
fact
is
held
to
be
unreal
and
government
like
every
thing
else
in
the
universe
is
simply
a
positive
development
of
nature
science
explains
the
laws
and
conditions
of
the
development
but
disdains
to
ask
for
its
origin
or
ground
in
any
order
that
transcends
the
changes
of
the
world
of
space
and
time
these
philosophers
profess
to
eschew
all
theory
and
yet
they
only
oppose
theory
to
theory
the
assertion
that
reality
for
the
human
mind
is
restricted
to
the
positive
facts
of
the
sensible
order
is
purely
theoretic
and
is
any
thing
but
a
positive
fact
principles
are
as
really
objects
of
science
as
facts
and
it
is
only
in
the
light
of
principles
that
facts
themselves
are
intelligible
if
the
human
mind
had
no
science
of
reality
that
transcends
the
sensible
order
or
the
positive
fact
it
could
have
no
science
at
all
as
things
exist
only
in
their
principles
or
causes
so
can
they
be
known
only
in
their
principles
and
causes
for
things
can
be
known
only
as
they
are
or
as
they
really
exist
the
science
that
pretends
to
deduce
principles
from
particular
facts
or
to
rise
from
the
fact
by
way
of
reasoning
to
an
order
that
transcends
facts
and
in
which
facts
have
their
origin
is
undoubtedly
chimerical
and
as
against
that
the
positivists
are
unquestionably
right
but
to
maintain
that
man
has
no
intelligence
of
any
thing
beyond
the
fact
no
intuition
or
intellectual
apprehension
of
its
principle
or
cause
is
equally
chimerical
the
human
mind
can
not
have
all
science
but
it
has
real
science
as
far
as
it
goes
and
real
science
is
the
knowledge
of
things
as
they
are
not
as
they
are
not
sensible
facts
are
not
intelligible
by
themselves
because
they
do
not
exist
by
themselves
and
if
the
human
mind
could
not
penetrate
beyond
the
individual
fact
beyond
the
mimetic
to
the
methexic
or
transcendental
principle
copied
or
imitated
by
the
individual
fact
it
could
never
know
the
fact
itself
the
error
of
modern
philosophers
or
philosopherlings
is
in
supposing
the
principle
is
deduced
or
inferred
from
the
fact
and
in
denying
that
the
human
mind
has
direct
and
immediate
intuition
of
it
something
that
transcends
the
sensible
order
there
must
be
or
there
could
be
no
development
and
if
we
had
no
science
of
it
we
could
never
assert
that
development
is
development
or
scientifically
explain
the
laws
and
conditions
of
development
development
is
explication
and
supposes
a
germ
which
precedes
it
and
is
not
itself
a
development
and
development
however
far
it
may
be
carried
can
never
do
more
than
realize
the
possibilities
of
the
germ
development
is
not
creation
and
can
not
supply
its
own
germ
that
at
least
must
be
given
by
the
creator
for
from
nothing
nothing
can
be
developed
if
authority
has
not
its
germ
in
nature
it
can
not
be
developed
from
nature
spontaneously
or
otherwise
all
government
has
a
governing
will
and
without
a
will
that
commands
there
is
no
government
and
nature
has
in
her
spontaneous
developments
no
will
for
she
has
no
personality
reason
itself
as
distinguished
from
will
only
presents
the
end
and
the
means
but
does
not
govern
it
prescribes
a
rule
but
can
not
ordain
a
law
an
imperative
will
the
will
of
a
superior
who
has
the
right
to
command
what
reason
dictates
or
approves
is
essential
to
government
and
that
will
is
not
developed
from
nature
because
it
has
no
germ
in
nature
so
something
above
and
beyond
nature
must
be
asserted
or
government
itself
can
not
be
asserted
even
as
a
development
nature
is
no
more
than
are
the
people
or
than
is
the
individual
man
no
doubt
there
is
a
natural
law
which
is
law
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
law
but
this
is
a
positive
law
under
which
nature
is
placed
by
a
sovereign
above
herself
and
is
never
to
be
confounded
with
those
laws
of
nature
according
to
which
she
is
productive
as
second
cause
or
produces
her
effects
which
are
not
properly
laws
at
all
fire
burns
water
flows
rain
falls
birds
fly
fishes
swim
food
nourishes
poisons
kill
one
substance
has
a
chemical
affinity
for
another
the
needle
points
to
the
pole
by
a
natural
law
it
is
said
that
is
the
effects
are
produced
by
an
inherent
and
uniform
natural
force
laws
in
this
sense
are
simply
physical
forces
and
are
nature
herself
the
natural
law
in
an
ethical
sense
is
not
a
physical
law
is
not
a
natural
force
but
a
law
impose
by
the
creator
on
all
moral
creatures
that
is
all
creatures
endowed
with
reason
and
and
is
called
natural
because
promulgated
in
natural
reason
or
the
reason
common
and
essential
to
all
moral
creatures
this
is
the
moral
law
it
is
what
the
french
call
le
droit
naturell
natural
right
and
as
the
theologians
teach
us
is
the
transcript
of
the
eternal
law
the
eternal
will
or
reason
of
god
it
is
the
foundation
of
all
law
and
all
acts
of
a
state
that
contravene
it
are
as
augustine
maintains
violences
rather
than
laws
the
moral
law
is
no
development
of
nature
for
it
is
above
nature
and
is
imposed
on
nature
the
only
development
there
is
about
it
is
in
our
understanding
of
it
there
is
of
course
development
in
nature
for
nature
considered
as
creation
has
been
created
in
germ
and
is
completed
only
in
successive
developments
hence
the
origin
of
space
and
time
there
would
have
been
no
space
if
there
had
been
no
external
creation
and
no
time
if
the
creation
had
been
completed
externally
at
once
as
it
was
in
relation
to
the
creator
ideal
space
is
simply
the
ability
of
god
to
externize
his
creative
act
and
actual
space
is
the
relation
of
coexistence
in
the
things
created
ideal
time
is
the
ability
of
god
to
create
existences
with
the
capacity
of
being
completed
by
successive
developments
and
actual
time
is
the
relation
of
these
in
the
order
of
succession
and
when
the
existence
is
completed
or
consummated
development
ceases
and
time
is
no
more
in
relation
to
himself
the
creator
works
are
complete
from
the
first
and
hence
with
him
there
is
no
time
for
there
is
no
succession
but
in
relation
to
itself
creation
is
incomplete
and
there
is
room
for
development
which
may
be
continued
till
the
whole
possibility
of
creation
is
actualized
here
is
the
foundation
of
what
is
true
in
the
modern
doctrine
of
progress
man
is
progressive
because
the
possibilities
of
his
nature
are
successively
unfolded
and
actualized
development
is
a
fact
and
its
laws
and
conditions
may
be
scientifically
ascertained
and
defined
all
generation
is
development
as
is
all
growth
physical
moral
or
intellectual
but
everything
is
developed
in
its
own
order
and
after
its
kind
the
darwinian
theory
of
the
development
of
species
is
not
sustained
by
science
the
development
starts
from
the
germ
and
in
the
germ
is
given
the
law
or
principle
of
the
development
from
the
acorn
is
developed
the
oak
never
the
pine
or
the
linden
every
kind
generates
its
kind
never
another
but
no
development
is
strictly
speaking
spontaneous
or
the
result
alone
of
the
inherent
energy
or
force
of
the
germ
developed
there
is
not
only
a
solidarity
of
race
but
in
some
sense
of
all
races
or
species
all
created
things
are
bound
to
their
creator
and
to
one
another
one
and
the
same
law
or
principle
of
life
pervades
all
creation
binding
the
universe
together
in
a
unity
that
copies
or
imitates
the
unity
of
the
creator
no
creature
is
isolated
from
the
rest
or
absolutely
independent
of
others
all
are
parts
of
one
stupendous
whole
and
each
depends
on
the
whole
and
the
whole
on
each
and
each
on
each
all
creatures
are
members
of
one
body
and
members
one
of
another
the
germ
of
the
oak
is
in
the
acorn
but
the
acorn
left
to
itself
alone
can
never
grow
into
the
oak
any
more
than
a
body
at
rest
can
place
itself
in
motion
lay
the
acorn
away
in
your
closet
where
it
is
absolutely
deprived
of
air
heat
and
moisture
and
in
vain
will
you
watch
for
its
germination
germinate
it
can
not
without
some
external
influence
or
communion
so
to
speak
with
the
elements
from
which
it
derives
its
sustenance
and
support
there
can
be
no
absolutely
spontaneous
development
all
things
are
doubtless
active
for
nothing
exists
except
in
so
far
as
it
is
an
active
force
of
some
sort
but
only
god
himself
alone
suffices
for
his
own
activity
all
created
things
are
dependent
have
not
their
being
in
themselves
and
are
real
only
as
they
participate
through
the
creative
act
of
the
divine
being
the
germ
can
no
more
be
developed
than
it
could
exist
without
god
and
no
more
develop
itself
than
it
could
create
itself
what
is
called
the
law
of
development
is
in
the
germ
but
that
law
or
force
can
operate
only
in
conjunction
with
another
force
or
other
forces
all
development
as
all
growth
is
by
accretion
or
assimilation
the
assimilating
force
is
if
you
will
in
the
germ
but
the
matter
assimilated
comes
and
must
come
from
abroad
every
herdsman
knows
it
and
knows
that
to
rear
his
stock
he
must
supply
them
with
appropriate
food
every
husbandman
knows
it
and
knows
that
to
raise
a
crop
of
corn
he
must
plant
the
seed
in
a
soil
duly
prepared
and
which
will
supply
the
gases
needed
for
its
germination
growth
flowering
boiling
and
ripening
in
all
created
things
in
all
things
not
complete
in
themselves
in
all
save
god
in
whom
there
is
no
development
possible
for
he
is
as
say
the
schoolmen
most
pure
act
in
whom
there
is
no
unactualized
possibility
the
same
law
holds
good
development
is
always
the
resultant
of
two
factors
the
one
the
thing
itself
the
other
some
external
force
with
it
exciting
it
and
aiding
it
to
act
hence
the
praemotio
physica
of
the
thomists
and
the
praevenient
and
adjuvant
grace
of
the
theologians
without
which
no
one
can
begin
the
christian
life
and
which
must
needs
be
supernatural
when
the
end
is
supernatural
the
principle
of
life
in
all
orders
is
the
same
and
human
activity
no
more
suffices
for
itself
in
one
order
than
in
another
here
is
the
reason
why
the
savage
tribe
never
rises
to
a
civilized
state
without
communion
in
some
form
with
a
people
already
civilized
and
why
there
is
no
moral
or
intellectual
development
and
progress
without
education
and
instruction
consequently
without
instructors
and
educators
hence
the
value
of
tradition
and
hence
as
the
first
man
could
not
instruct
himself
christian
theologians
with
a
deeper
philosophy
than
is
dreamed
of
by
the
sciolists
of
the
age
maintain
that
god
himself
was
man
first
teacher
or
that
he
created
adam
a
man
with
all
his
faculties
developed
complete
and
in
full
activity
hence
too
the
heathen
mythologies
which
always
contain
some
elements
of
truth
however
they
may
distort
mutilate
or
travesty
them
make
the
gods
the
first
teachers
of
the
human
race
and
ascribe
to
their
instruction
even
the
most
simple
and
ordinary
arts
of
life
the
gods
teach
men
to
plough
to
plant
to
reap
to

in

to
erect
a
shelter
from
the
storm
and
to
build
a

to
warm
them
and
to
cook
their
food
the
common
sense
as
well
as
the
common
traditions
of
mankind
refuses
to
accept
the
doctrine
that
men
are
developed
without
foreign
aid
or
progressive
without
divine
assistance
nature
of
herself
can
no
more
develop
government
than
it
can
language
there
can
be
no
language
without
society
and
no
society
without
language
there
can
be
no
government
without
society
and
no
society
without
government
of
some
sort
but
even
if
nature
could
spontaneously
develop
herself
she
could
never
develop
an
institution
that
has
the
right
to
govern
for
she
has
not
herself
that
right
nature
is
not
god
has
not
created
us
therefore
has
not
the
right
of
property
in
us
she
is
not
and
can
not
be
our
sovereign
we
belong
not
to
her
nor
does
she
belong
to
herself
for
she
is
herself
creature
and
belongs
to
her
creator
not
being
in
herself
sovereign
she
can
not
develop
the
right
to
govern
nor
can
she
develop
government
as
a
fact
to
say
nothing
of
its
right
for
government
whether
we
speak
of
it
as
fact
or
as
authority
is
distinct
from
that
which
is
governed
but
natural
developments
are
nature
and
indistinguishable
from
her
the
governor
and
the
governed
the
restrainer
and
the
restrained
can
never
as
such
be
identical
taken
strictly
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
when
an
individual
is
said
to
govern
himself
he
is
never
understood
to
govern
himself
in
the
sense
in
which
he
is
governed
he
by
his
reason
and
will
governs
or
restrains
his
appetites
and
passions
it
is
man
as
spirit
governing
man
as
flesh
the
spiritual
mind
governing
the
carnal
mind
natural
developments
can
not
in
all
cases
be
even
allowed
to
take
their
own
course
without
injury
to
nature
herself
follow
nature
is
an
unsafe
maxim
if
it
means
leave
nature
to
develop
herself
as
she
will
and
follow
thy
natural
inclinations
nature
is
good
but
inclinations
are
frequently
bad
all
our
appetites
and
passions
are
given
us
for
good
for
a
purpose
useful
and
necessary
to
individual
and
social
life
but
they
become
morbid
and
injurious
if
indulged
without
restraint
each
has
its
special
object
and
naturally
seeks
it
exclusively
and
thus
generates
discord
and
war
in
the
individual
which
immediately
find
expression
in
society
and
also
in
the
state
if
the
state
be
a
simple
natural
development
the
christian
maxim
deny
thyself
is
far
better
than
the
epicurean
maxim
enjoy
thyself
for
there
is
no
real
enjoyment
without
there
is
deep
philosophy
in
christian
asceticism
as
the
positivists
themselves
are
aware
and
even
insist
but
christian
asceticism
aims
not
to
destroy
nature
as
voluptuaries
pretend
but
to
regulate
direct
and
restrain
its
abnormal
developments
for
its
own
good
it
forces
nature
in
her
developments
to
submit
to
a
law
which
is
not
in
her
but
above
her
the
positivists
pretend
that
this
asceticism
is
itself
a
natural
development
but
that
can
not
be
a
natural
development
which
directs
controls
and
restrains
natural
development
the
positivists
confound
nature
at
one
time
with
the
law
of
nature
and
at
another
the
law
of
nature
with
nature
herself
and
take
what
is
called
the
natural
law
to
be
a
natural
development
here
is
their
mistake
as
it
is
the
mistake
of
all
who
accept
naturalistic
theories
society
no
doubt
is
authorized
by
the
law
of
nature
to
institute
and
maintain
government
but
the
law
of
nature
is
not
a
natural
development
nor
is
it
in
nature
or
any
part
of
nature
it
is
not
a
natural
force
which
operates
in
nature
and
which
is
the
developing
principle
of
nature
do
they
say
reason
is
natural
and
the
law
of
nature
is
only
reason
this
is
not
precisely
the
fact
the
natural
law
is
law
proper
and
is
reason
only
in
the
sense
that
reason
includes
both
intellect
and
will
and
nobody
can
pretend
that
nature
in
her
spontaneous
developments
acts
from
intelligence
and
volition
reason
as
the
faculty
of
knowing
is
subjective
and
natural
but
in
the
sense
in
which
it
is
coincident
with
the
natural
law
it
is
neither
subjective
nor
natural
but
objective
and
divine
and
is
god
affirming
himself
and
promulgating
his
law
to
his
creature
man
it
is
at
least
an
immediate
participation
of
the
divine
by
which
he
reveals
himself
and
his
will
to
the
human
understanding
and
is
not
natural
but
supernatural
in
the
sense
that
god
himself
is
supernatural
this
is
wherefore
reason
is
law
and
every
man
is
bound
to
submit
or
conform
to
reason
that
legitimate
governments
are
instituted
under
the
natural
law
is
frankly
conceded
but
this
is
by
no
means
the
concession
of
government
as
a
natural
development
the
reason
and
will
of
which
the
natural
law
is
the
expression
are
the
reason
and
will
of
god
the
natural
law
is
the
divine
law
as
much
as
the
revealed
law
itself
and
equally
obligatory
it
is
not
a
natural
force
developing
itself
in
nature
like
the
law
of
generation
for
instance
and
therefore
proceeding
from
god
as
first
cause
but
it
proceeds
from
god
as
final
cause
and
is
therefore
theological
and
strictly
a
moral
law
founding
moral
rights
and
duties
of
course
all
morality
and
all
legitimate
government
rest
on
this
law
or
if
you
will
originate
in
it
but
not
therefore
in
nature
but
in
the
author
of
nature
the
authority
is
not
the
authority
of
nature
but
of
him
who
holds
nature
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
in
the
seventeenth
century
a
class
of
political
writers
who
very
well
understood
that
no
creature
no
man
no
number
of
men
not
even
nature
herself
can
be
inherently
sovereign
defended
the
opinion
that
governments
are
founded
constituted
and
clothed
with
their
authority
by
the
direct
and
express
appointment
of
god
himself
they
denied
that
rulers
hold
their
power
from
the
nation
that
however
oppressive
may
be
their
rule
that
they
are
justiciable
by
any
human
tribunal
or
that
power
except
by
the
direct
judgment
of
god
is
amissible
their
doctrine
is
known
in
history
as
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
right
of
kings
and
passive
obedience
all
power
says
paul
is
from
god
and
the
powers
that
be
are
ordained
of
god
and
to
resist
them
is
to
resist
the
ordination
of
god
they
must
be
obeyed
for
conscience
sake
it
would
perhaps
be
rash
to
say
that
this
doctrine
had
never
been
broached
before
the
seventeenth
century
but
it
received
in
that
century
and
chiefly
in
england
its
fullest
and
most
systematic
developments
it
was
patronized
by
the
anglican
divines
asserted
by
james
of
england
and
lost
the
stuarts
the
crown
of
three
kingdoms
it
crossed
the
channel
into
france
where
it
found
a
few
hesitating
and
stammering
defenders
among
catholics
under
louis
but
it
has
never
been
very
generally
held
though
it
has
had
able
and
zealous
supporters
in
england
it
was
opposed
by
all
the
presbyterians
puritans
independents
and
republicans
and
was
forgotten
or
abandoned
by
the
anglican
divines
themselves
in
the
revolution
of
that
expelled
james
ii
and
crowned
william
and
mary
it
was
ably
refuted
by
the
jesuit
suarez
in
his
reply
to
a
remonstrance
for
the
divine
right
of
kings
by
the
james
and
a
spanish
monk
who
had
asserted
it
in
madrid
under
philip
was
compelled
by
the
inquisition
to
retract
it
publicly
in
the
place
where
he
had
asserted
it
all
republicans
reject
it
and
the
church
has
never
sanctioned
it
the
sovereign
pontiffs
have
claimed
and
exercised
the
right
to
deprive
princes
of
their
principality
and
to
absolve
their
subjects
from
the
oath
of
fidelity
whether
the
popes
rightly
claimed
and
exercised
that
power
is
not
now
the
question
but
their
having
claimed
and
exercised
it
proves
that
the
church
does
not
admit
the
inamissibility
of
power
and
passive
obedience
for
the
action
of
the
pope
was
judicial
not
legislative
the
pope
has
never
claimed
the
right
to
depose
a
prince
till
by
his
own
act
he
has
under
the
moral
law
or
the
constitution
of
his
state
forfeited
his
power
nor
to
absolve
subjects
from
their
allegiance
till
their
oath
according
to
its
true
intent
and
meaning
has
ceased
to
bind
if
the
church
has
always
asserted
with
the
apostle
there
is
no
power
but
from
god
non
est
potestas
nisi
a
deo
she
has
always
through
her
doctors
maintained
that
it
is
a
trust
to
be
exercised
for
the
public
good
and
is
forfeited
when
persistently
exercised
in
a
contrary
sense
augustine
thomas
and
suarez
all
maintain
that
unjust
laws
are
violences
rather
than
laws
and
do
not
oblige
except
in
charity
or
prudence
and
that
the
republic
may
change
its
magistrates
and
even
its
constitution
if
it
sees
proper
to
do
so
that
god
as
universal
creator
is
sovereign
lord
and
proprietor
of
all
created
things
or
existences
visible
or
invisible
is
certain
for
the
maker
has
the
absolute
right
to
the
thing
made
it
is
his
and
he
may
do
with
it
as
he
will
as
he
is
sole
creator
he
alone
hath
dominion
and
as
he
is
absolute
creator
he
has
absolute
dominion
over
all
the
things
which
he
has
made
the
guaranty
against
oppression
is
his
own
essential
nature
is
in
the
plenitude
of
his
own
being
which
is
the
plenitude
of
wisdom
and
goodness
he
can
not
contradict
himself
be
other
than
he
is
or
act
otherwise
than
according
to
his
own
essential
nature
as
he
is
in
his
own
eternal
and
immutable
essence
supreme
reason
and
supreme
good
his
dominion
must
always
in
its
exercise
be
supremely
good
and
supremely
reasonable
therefore
supremely
just
and
equitable
from
him
certainly
is
all
power
he
is
unquestionably
king
of
kings
and
lord
of
lords
by
him
kings
reign
and
magistrates
decree
just
things
he
may
at
his
will
set
up
or
pull
down
kings
rear
or
overwhelm
empires
foster
the
infant
colony
and
make
desolate
the
populous
city
all
this
is
unquestionably
true
and
a
simple
dictate
of
reason
common
to
all
men
but
in
what
sense
is
it
true
is
it
true
in
a
supernatural
sense
or
is
it
true
only
in
the
sense
that
it
is
true
that
by
him
we
breathe
perform
any
or
all
of
our
natural
functions
and
in
him
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
viewed
in
their
first
cause
all
things
are
the
immediate
creation
of
god
and
are
supernatural
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
first
cause
the
scriptures
usually
speak
for
the
great
purpose
and
paramount
object
of
the
sacred
writers
as
of
religion
itself
is
to
make
prominent
the
fact
that
god
is
universal
creator
and
supreme
governor
and
therefore
the
first
and
final
cause
of
all
things
but
god
creates
second
causes
or
substantial
existences
capable
themselves
of
acting
and
producing
effects
in
a
secondary
sense
and
hence
he
is
said
to
be
causa
causarum
cause
of
causes
what
is
done
by
these
second
causes
or
creatures
is
done
eminently
by
him
for
they
exist
only
by
his
creative
act
and
produce
only
by
virtue
of
his
active
presence
or
effective
concurrence
what
he
does
through
them
or
through
their
agency
is
done
by
him
not
immediately
but
mediately
and
is
said
to
be
done
naturally
as
what
he
does
immediately
is
said
to
be
done
supernaturally
natural
is
what
god
does
through
second
causes
which
he
creates
supernatural
is
that
which
he
does
by
himself
alone
without
their
intervention
or
agency
sovereignty
or
the
right
to
govern
is
in
him
and
he
may
at
his
will
delegate
it
to
men
either
mediately
or
immediately
by
a
direct
and
express
appointment
or
mediately
through
nature
in
the
absence
of
all
facts
proving
its
delegation
direct
and
express
it
must
be
assumed
to
be
mediate
through
second
causes
the
natural
is
always
to
be
presumed
and
the
supernatural
is
to
be
admitted
only
on
conclusive
proof
the
people
of
israel
had
a
supernatural
vocation
and
they
received
their
law
embracing
their
religious
and
civil
constitution
and
their
ritual
directly
from
god
at
the
hand
of
moses
and
various
individuals
from
time
to
time
appear
to
have
been
specially
called
to
be
their
judges
rulers
or
kings
saul
was
so
called
and
so
was
david
david
and
his
line
appear
also
to
have
been
called
not
only
to
supplant
saul
and
his
line
but
to
have
been
supernaturally
invested
with
the
kingdom
forever
but
it
does
not
appear
that
the
royal
power
with
which
david
and
his
line
were
invested
was
inamissible
they
lost
it
in
the
babylonish
captivity
and
never
afterwards
recovered
it
the
asmonean
princes
were
of
another
line
and
when
our
lord
came
the
sceptre
was
in
the
hands
of
herod
an
idumean
or
edomite
the
promise
made
to
david
and
his
house
is
generally
held
by
christian
commentators
to
have
received
its
fulfilment
in
the
everlasting
spiritual
royalty
of
the
messiah
sprung
through
mary
from
david
line
the
christian
church
is
supernaturally
constituted
and
supernaturally
governed
but
the
persons
selected
to
exercise
powers
supernaturally
defined
from
the
sovereign
pontiff
down
to
the
humblest
parish
priest
are
selected
and
inducted
into
office
through
human
agency
the
gentiles
very
generally
claimed
to
have
received
their
laws
from
the
gods
but
it
does
not
appear
save
in
exceptional
cases
that
they
claimed
that
their
princes
were
designated
and
held
their
powers
by
the
direct
and
express
appointment
of
the
god
save
in
the
case
of
the
jews
and
that
of
the
church
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
particular
government
exists
or
ever
has
existed
by
direct
or
express
appointment
or
otherwise
than
by
the
action
of
the
creator
through
second
causes
or
what
is
called
his
ordinary
providence
except
david
and
his
line
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
express
grant
by
the
divine
sovereign
to
any
individual
or
family
class
or
caste
of
the
government
of
any
nation
or
country
even
those
christian
princes
who
professed
to
reign
by
the
grace
of
god
never
claimed
that
they
received
their
principalities
from
god
otherwise
than
through
his
ordinary
providence
and
meant
by
it
little
more
than
an
acknowledgment
of
their
dependence
on
him
their
obligation
to
use
their
power
according
to
his
law
and
their
accountability
to
him
for
the
use
they
make
of
it
the
doctrine
is
not
favorable
to
human
liberty
for
it
recognizes
no
rights
of
man
in
face
of
civil
society
it
consecrates
tyranny
and
makes
god
the
accomplice
of
the
tyrant
if
we
suppose
all
governments
have
actually
existed
by
his
express
appointment
it
puts
the
king
in
the
place
of
god
and
requires
us
to
worship
in
him
the
immediate
representative
of
the
divine
being
power
is
irresponsible
and
inamissible
and
however
it
may
be
abused
or
however
corrupt
and
oppressive
may
be
its
exercise
there
is
no
human
redress
resistance
to
power
is
resistance
to
god
there
is
nothing
for
the
people
but
passive
obedience
and
unreserved
submission
the
doctrine
in
fact
denies
all
human
government
and
allows
the
people
no
voice
in
the
management
of
their
own
affairs
and
gives
no
place
for
human
activity
it
stands
opposed
to
all
republicanism
and
makes
power
an
hereditary
and
indefeasible
right
not
a
trust
which
he
who
holds
it
may
forfeit
and
of
which
he
may
be
deprived
if
he
abuses
it

the
theory
which
derives
the
right
of
government
from
the
direct
and
express
appointment
of
god
is
sometimes
modified
so
as
to
mean
that
civil
authority
is
derived
from
god
through
the
spiritual
authority
the
patriarch
combined
in
his

both
authorities

both
priest
and
king

they
were
still
united
melchisedech
king
of
salem
was
both
priest
and
king
and
the
earliest
historical
records
of
kings
present
them
as
offering
sacrifices
even
the
roman
emperor
was
pontifex
maximus
as
well
as
imperator
but
that
was
so
not
because
the
two
offices
were
held
to
be
inseparable
but
because
they
were
both
conferred
on
the
same
person
by
the
republic
in
egypt
in
the
time
of
moses
the
royal
authority
and
the
priestly
were
separated
and
held
by
different
persons
moses
in
his
legislation
for
his
nation
separated
them
and
instituted
a
sacerdotal
order
or
caste
the
heads
of
tribes
and
the
heads
of
families
are
under
his
law
princes
but
not
priests
and
the
priesthood
is
conferred
on
and
restricted
to
his
own
tribe
of
levi
and
more
especially
the
family
of
his
own
brother
aaron
the
priestly
office
by
its
own
nature
is
superior
to
the
kingly
and
in
all
primitive
nations
with
a
separate
organized
priesthood
whether
a
true
priesthood
or
a
corrupt
the
priest
is
held
to
be
above
the
king
elects
or
establishes
the
law
by
which
is
selected
the
temporal
chief
and
inducts
him
into
his
office
as
if
he
received
his
authority
from
god
through
the
priesthood
the
christian
priesthood
is
not
a
caste
and
is
transmitted
by
the
election
of
grace
not
as
with
the
israelites
and
all
sacerdotal
nations
by
natural
generation
like
him
whose
priests
they
are
christian
priests
are
priests
after
the
order
of
melchisedech
who
was
without
priestly
descent
without
father
or
mother
of
the
priestly
line
but
in
being
priests
after
the
order
of
melchisedech
they
are
both
priests
and
kings
as
melchisedech
was
and
as
was
our
lord
himself
to
whom
was
given
by
his
father
all
power
in
heaven
and
in
earth
the
pope
or
supreme
pontiff
is
the
vicar
of
our
lord
on
earth
his
representative
the
representative
not
only
of
him
who
is
our
invisible
but
of
him
who
is
king
of
kings
and
lord
of
lords
therefore
of
both
the
priestly
and
the
kingly
power
consequently
no
one
can
have
any
mission
to
govern
in
the
state
any
more
than
in
the
church
unless
derived
from
god
directly
or
indirectly
through
the
pope
or
supreme
pontiff
many
theologians
and
canonists
in
the
middle
ages
so
held
and
a
few
perhaps
hold
so
still
the
bulls
and
briefs
of
several
popes
as
gregory
innocent
gregory
innocent
and
boniface
have
the
appearance
of
favoring
it
at
one
period
the
greater
part
of
the
medieval
kingdoms
and
principalities
were
fiefs
of
the
holy
see
and
recognized
the
holy
father
as
their
suzerain
the
pope
revived
the
imperial
dignity
in
the
person
of
charlemagne
and
none
could
claim
that
dignity
in
the
western
world
unless
elected
and
crowned
by
him
that
is
unless
elected
directly
by
the
pope
or
by
electors
designated
by
him
and
acting
under
his
authority
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
spiritual
is
superior
to
the
temporal
and
that
the
temporal
is
bound
in
the
very
nature
of
things
to
conform
to
the
spiritual
and
any
law
enacted
by
the
civil
power
in
contravention
of
the
law
of
god
is
null
and
void
from
the
beginning
this
is
what
seward
meant
by
the
higher
law
a
law
higher
even
than
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
supposing
this
higher
law
and
supposing
that
kings
and
princes
hold
from
god
through
the
spiritual
society
it
is
very
evident
that
the
chief
of
that
society
would
have
the
right
to
deprive
them
and
to
absolve
their
subjects
as
on
several
occasions
he
actually
has
done
but
this
theory
has
never
been
a
dogma
of
the
church
nor
to
any
great
extent
except
for
a
brief
period
maintained
by
theologians
or
canonists
the
pope
conferred
the
imperial
dignity
on
charlemagne
and
his
successors
but
not
the
civil
power
at
least
out
of
the
pope
own
temporal
dominions
the
emperor
of
germany
was
at
first
elected
by
the
pope
and
afterwards
by
hereditary
electors
designated
or
accepted
by
him
but
the
king
of
the
germans
with
the
full
royal
authority
could
be
elected
and
enthroned
without
the
papal
intervention
or
permission
the
suzerainty
of
the
holy
see
over
italy
naples
aragon
muscovy
england
and
other
european
states
was
by
virtue
of
feudal
relations
not
by
virtue
of
the
spiritual
authority
of
the
holy
see
or
the
vicarship
of
the
holy
father
the
right
to
govern
under
feudalism
was
simply
an
estate
or
property
and
as
the
church
could
acquire
and
hold
property
nothing
prevented
her
holding
fiefs
or
her
chief
from
being
suzerain
the
expressions
in
the
papal
briefs
and
bulls
taken
in
connection
with
the
special
relations
existing
between
the
pope
and
emperor
in
the
middle
ages
and
his
relations
with
other
states
as
their
feudal
sovereign
explained
by
the
controversies
concerning
rights
growing
out
of
these
relations
will
be
found
to
give
no
countenance
to
the
theory
in
question
these
relations
really
existed
and
they
gave
the
pope
certain
temporal
rights
in
certain
states
even
the
temporal
supremacy
as
he
has
still
in
what
is
left
him
of
the
states
of
the
church
but
they
were
exceptional
or
accidental
relations
not
the
universal
and
essential
relations
between
the
church
and
the
state
the
rights
that
grew
out
of
these
relations
were
real
rights
sacred
and
inviolable
but
only
where
and
while
the
relations
subsisted
they
for
the
most
part
grew
out
of
the
feudal
system
introduced
into
the
roman
empire
by
its
barbarian
conquerors
and
necessarily
ceased
with
the
political
order
in
which
they
originated
undoubtedly
the
church
consecrated
civil
rulers
but
this
did
not
imply
that
they
received
their
power
or
right
to
govern
from
god
through
her
but
implied
that
their
persons
were
sacred
and
that
violence
to
them
would
be
sacrilege
that
they
held
the
christian
faith
and
acknowledged
themselves
bound
to
protect
it
and
to
govern
their
subjects
justly
according
to
the
law
of
god
the
church
moreover
has
always
recognized
the
distinction
of
the
two
powers
and
although
the
pope
owes
to
the
fact
that
he
is
chief
of
the
spiritual
society
his
temporal
principality
no
theologian
or
canonist
of
the
slightest
respectability
would
argue
that
he
derives
his
rights
as
temporal
sovereign
from
his
rights
as
pontiff
his
rights
as
pontiff
depend
on
the
express
appointment
of
god
his
rights
as
temporal
prince
are
derived
from
the
same
source
from
which
other
princes
derive
their
rights
and
are
held
by
the
same
tenure
hence
canonists
have
maintained
that
the
subjects
of
other
states
may
even
engage
in
war
with
the
pope
as
prince
without
breach
of
their
fidelity
to
him
as
pontiff
or
supreme
visible
head
of
the
church
the
church
not
only
distinguishes
between
the
two
powers
but
recognizes
as
legitimate
governments
that
manifestly
do
not
derive
from
god
through
her
paul
enjoins
obedience
to
the
roman
emperors
for
conscience
sake
and
the
church
teaches
that
infidels
and
heretics
may
have
legitimate
government
and
if
she
has
ever
denied
the
right
of
any
infidel
or
heretical
prince
it
has
been
on
the
ground
that
the
constitution
and
laws
of
his
principality
require
him
to
profess
and
protect
the
catholic
faith
she
tolerates
resistance
in
a
state
no
more
than
in
a
catholic
state
to
the
prince
and
if
she
has
not
condemned
and
cut
off
from
her
communion
the
catholics
who
in
our
struggle
have
joined
the
secessionists
and
fought
in
their
ranks
against
the
united
states
it
is
because
the
prevalence
of
the
doctrine
of
state
sovereignty
has
seemed
to
leave
a
reasonable
doubt
whether
they
were
really
rebels
fighting
against
their
legitimate
sovereign
or
not
no
doubt
as
the
authority
of
the
church
is
derived
immediately
from
god
in
a
supernatural
manner
and
as
she
holds
that
the
state
derives
its
authority
only
mediately
from
him
in
a
natural
mode
she
asserts
the
superiority
of
her
authority
and
that
in
case
of
conflict
between
the
two
powers
the
civil
must
yield
but
this
is
only
saying
that
supernatural
is
above
natural
but
and
this
is
the
important
point
she
does
not
teach
nor
permit
the
faithful
to
hold
that
the
supernatural
abrogates
the
natural
or
in
any
way
supersedes
it
grace
say
the
theologians
supposes
nature
gratia
supponit
naturam
the
church
in
the
matter
of
government
accepts
the
natural
aids
it
elevates
it
and
is
its
firmest
support
vii
augustine
gregory
magnus
thomas
bellarmin
suarez
and
the
theologians
generally
hold
that
princes
derive
their
power
from
god
through
the
people
or
that
the
people
though
not
the
source
are
the
medium
of
all
political
authority
and
therefore
rulers
are
accountable
for
the
use
they
make
of
their
power
to
both
god
and
the
people
this
doctrine
agrees
with
the
democratic
theory
in
vesting
sovereignty
in
the
people
instead
of
the
king
or
the
nobility
a
particular
individual
family
class
or
caste
and
differs
from
it
as
democracy
is
commonly
explained
in
understanding
by
the
people
the
people
collectively
not
individually
the
organic
people
or
people
fixed
to
a
given
territory
not
the
people
as
a
mere
population
the
people
in
the
republican
sense
of
the
word
nation
not
in
the
barbaric
or
despotic
sense
and
in
deriving
the
sovereignty
from
god
from
whom
is
all
power
and
except
from
whom
there
is
and
can
be
no
power
instead
of
asserting
it
as
the
underived
and
indefeasible
right
of
the
people
in
their
own
native
right
and
might
the
people
not
being
god
and
being
only
what
philosophers
call
a
second
cause
they
are
and
can
be
sovereign
only
in
a
secondary
and
relative
sense
it
asserts
the
divine
origin
of
power
while
democracy
asserts
its
human
origin
but
as
under
the
law
of
nature
all
men
are
equal
or
have
equal
rights
as
men
one
man
has
and
can
have
in
himself
no
right
to
govern
another
and
as
man
is
never
absolutely
his
own
but
always
and
everywhere
belongs
to
his
creator
it
is
clear
that
no
government
originating
in
humanity
alone
can
be
a
legitimate
government
every
such
government
is
founded
on
the
assumption
that
man
is
god
which
is
a
great
mistake
is
in
fact
the
fundamental
sophism
which
underlies
every
error
and
every
sin
the
divine
origin
of
government
in
the
sense
asserted
by
christian
theologians
is
never
found
distinctly
set
forth
in
the
political
writings
of
the
ancient
greek
and
roman
writers
gentile
philosophy
had
lost
the
tradition
of
creation
as
some
modern
philosophers
in
christian
nations
are
fast
losing
it
and
were
as
unable
to
explain
the
origin
of
government
as
they
were
the
origin
of
man
himself
even
plato
the
profoundest
of
all
ancient
philosophers
and
the
most
faithful
to
the
traditionary
wisdom
of
the
race
lacks
the
conception
of
creation
and
never
gets
above
that
of
generation
and
formation
things
are
produced
by
the
divine
being
impressing
his
own
ideas
eternal
in
his
own
mind
on
a
matter
as
a
seal
on
wax
aristotle
teaches
substantially
the
same
doctrine
things
eternally
exist
as
matter
and
form
and
all
the
divine
intelligence
does
is
to
unite
the
form
to
the
matter
and
change
it
as
the
schoolmen
say
from
materia
informis
to
materia
formata
even
the
christian
platonists
and
peripatetics
never
as
philosophers
assert
creation
they
assert
it
indeed
but
as
theologians
as
a
fact
of
revelation
not
as
a
fact
of
science
and
hence
it
is
that
their
theology
and
their
philosophy
never
thoroughly
harmonize
or
at
least
are
not
shown
to
harmonize
throughout
speaking
generally
the
ancient
gentile
philosophers
were
pantheists
and
represented
the
universe
either
as
god
or
as
an
emanation
from
god
they
had
no
proper
conception
of
providence
or
the
action
of
god
in
nature
through
natural
agencies
or
as
modern
physicists
say
natural
laws
if
they
recognized
the
action
of
divinity
at
all
it
was
a
supernatural
or
miraculous
intervention
of
some
god
they
saw
no
divine
intervention
in
any
thing
naturally
explicable
or
explicable
by
natural
laws
having
no
conception
of
the
creative
act
they
could
have
none
of
its
immanence
or
the
active
and
efficacious
presence
of
the
creator
in
all
his
works
even
in
the
action
of
second
causes
themselves
hence
they
could
not
assert
the
divine
origin
of
government
or
civil
authority
without
supposing
it
supernaturally
founded
and
excluding
all
human
and
natural
agencies
from
its
institution
their
writings
may
be
studied
with
advantage
on
the
constitution
of
the
state
on
the
practical
workings
of
different
forms
of
government
as
well
as
on
the
practical
administration
of
affairs
but
never
on
the
origin
of
the
state
and
the
real
ground
of
its
authority
the
doctrine
is
derived
from
christian
theology
which
teaches
that
there
is
no
power
except
from
god
and
enjoins
civil
obedience
as
a
religious
duty
conscience
is
accountable
to
god
alone
and
civil
government
if
it
had
only
a
natural
or
human
origin
could
not
bind
it
yet
christianity
makes
the
civil
law
within
its
legitimate
sphere
as
obligatory
on
conscience
as
the
divine
law
itself
and
no
man
is
blameless
before
god
who
is
not
blameless
before
the
state
no
man
performs
faithfully
his
religious
duties
who
neglects
his
civil
duties
and
hence
the
law
of
the
church
allows
no
one
to
retire
from
the
world
and
enter
a
religious
order
who
has
duties
that
bind
him
or
her
to
the
family
or
the
state
though
it
is
possible
that
the
law
is
not
always
strictly
observed
and
that
individuals
sometimes
enter
a
convent
for
the
sake
of
getting
rid
of
those
duties
or
the
equally
important
duty
of
taking
care
of
themselves
but
by
asserting
the
divine
origin
of
government
christianity
consecrates
civil
authority
clothes
it
with
a
religious
character
and
makes
civil
disobedience
sedition
insurrection
rebellion
revolution
civil
turbulence
of
any
sort
or
degree
sins
against
god
as
well
as
crimes
against
the
state
for
the
same
reason
she
makes
usurpation
tyranny
oppression
of
the
people
by
civil
rulers
offences
against
god
as
well
as
against
society
and
cognizable
by
the
spiritual
authority
after
the
establishment
of
the
christian
church
after
its
public
recognition
and
when
conflicting
claims
arose
between
the
two
powers
the
civil
and
the
ecclesiastical
this
doctrine
of
the
divine
origin
of
civil
government
was
abused
and
turned
against
the
church
with
most
disastrous
consequences
while
the
roman
empire
of
the
west
subsisted
and
even
after
its
fall
so
long
as
the
emperor
of
the
east
asserted
and
practically
maintained
his
authority
in
the
exarchate
of
ravenna
and
the
duchy
of
rome
the
popes
comported
themselves
in
civil
matters
as
subjects
of
the
roman
emperor
and
set
forth
no
claim
to
temporal
independence
but
when
the
emperor
had
lost
rome
and
all
his
possessions
in
italy
had
abandoned
them
or
been
deprived
of
them
by
the
barbarians
and
ceased
to
make
any
efforts
to
recover
them
the
pope
was
no
longer
a
subject
even
in
civil
matters
of
the
emperor
and
owed
him
no
civil
allegiance
he
became
civilly
independent
of
the
roman
empire
and
had
only
spiritual
relations
with
it
to
the
new
powers
that
sprang
up
in
europe
he
appears
never
to
have
acknowledged
any
civil
subjection
and
uniformly
asserted
in
face
of
them
his
civil
as
well
as
spiritual
independence
this
civil
independence
the
successors
of
charlemagne
who
pretended
to
be
the
successors
of
the
roman
emperors
of
the
west
and
called
their
empire
the
holy
roman
empire
denied
and
maintained
that
the
pope
owed
them
civil
allegiance
or
that
in
temporals
the
emperor
was
the
pope
superior
if
said
the
emperor
or
his
lawyers
for
him
the
civil
power
is
from
god
as
it
must
be
since
non
est
potestas
nisi
a
deo
the
state
stands
on
the
same
footing
with
the
church
and
the
imperial
power
emanates
from
as
high
a
source
as
the
pontifical
the
emperor
is
then
as
supreme
in
temporals
as
the
pope
in
spirituals
and
as
the
emperor
is
subject
to
the
pope
in
spirituals
so
must
the
pope
be
subject
to
the
emperor
in
temporals
as
at
the
time
when
the
dispute
arose
the
temporal
interests
of
churchmen
were
so
interwoven
with
their
spiritual
rights
the
pretensions
of
the
emperor
amounted
practically
to
the
subjection
in
spirituals
as
well
as
temporals
of
the
ecclesiastical
authority
to
the
civil
and
absorbed
the
church
in
the
state
the
reasoning
was
denied
and
churchmen
replied
the
pope
represents
the
spiritual
order
which
is
always
and
everywhere
supreme
over
the
temporal
since
the
spiritual
order
is
the
divine
sovereignty
itself
always
and
everywhere
then
is
the
pope
independent
of
the
emperor
his
superior
and
to
subject
him
in
any
thing
to
the
emperor
would
be
as
repugnant
to
reason
as
to
subject
the
soul
to
the
body
the
spirit
to
the
flesh
heaven
to
earth
or
god
to
man
if
the
universal
supremacy
claimed
for
the
pope
rejoined
the
imperialists
be
conceded
the
state
would
be
absorbed
in
the
church
the
autonomy
of
civil
society
would
be
destroyed
and
civil
rulers
would
have
no
functions
but
to
do
the
bidding
of
the
clergy
it
would
establish
a
complete
theocracy
or
rather
clerocracy
of
all
possible
governments
the
government
the
most
odious
to
mankind
and
the
most
hostile
to
social
progress
even
the
jews
could
not
or
would
not
endure
it
and
prayed
god
to
give
them
a
king
that
they
might
be
like
other
nations
in
the
heat
of
the
controversy
neither
party
clearly
and
distinctly
perceived
the
true
state
of
the
question
and
each
was
partly
right
and
partly
wrong
the
imperialists
wanted
room
for
the
free
activity
of
civil
society
the
church
wanted
to
establish
in
that
society
the
supremacy
of
the
moral
order
or
the
law
of
god
without
which
governments
can
have
no
stability
and
society
no
real
the
real
solution
of
the
difficulty
was
always
to
be
found
in
the
doctrine
of
the
church
herself
and
had
been
given
time
and
again
by
her
most
approved
theologians
the
pope
as
the
visible
head
of
the
spiritual
society
is
no
doubt
superior
to
the
emperor
not
precisely
because
he
represents
a
superior
order
but
because
the
church
of
which
he
is
the
visible
chief
is
a
supernatural
institution
and
holds
immediately
from
god
whereas
civil
society
represented
by
the
emperor
holds
from
god
only
mediately
through
second
causes
or
the
people
yet
though
derived
from
god
only
through
the
people
civil
authority
still
holds
from
god
and
derives
its
right
from
him
through
another
channel
than
the
church
or
spiritual
society
and
therefore
has
a
right
a
sacredness
which
the
church
herself
gives
not
and
must
recognize
and
respect
this
she
herself
teaches
in
teaching
that
even
infidels
as
we
have
seen
may
have
legitimate
government
and
since
though
she
interprets
and
applies
the
law
of
god
both
natural
and
revealed
she
makes
neither
nevertheless
the
imperialists
or
the
statists
insisted
on
their
false
charge
against
the
pope
that
he
labored
to
found
a
purely
theocratic
or
clerocratic
government
and
finding
themselves
unable
to
place
the
representative
of
the
civil
society
on
the
same
level
with
the
representative
of
the
spiritual
or
to
emancipate
the
state
from
the
law
of
god
while
they
conceded
the
divine
origin
or
right
of
government
they
sought
to
effect
its
independence
by
asserting
for
it
only
a
natural
or
purely
human
origin
for
nearly
two
centuries
the
most
popular
and
influential
writers
on
government
have
rejected
the
divine
origin
and
ground
of
civil
authority
and
excluded
god
from
the
state
they
have
refused
to
look
beyond
second
causes
and
have
labored
to
derive
authority
from
man
alone
they
have
not
only
separated
the
state
from
the
church
as
an
external
corporation
but
from
god
as
its
internal
lawgiver
and
by
so
doing
have
deprived
the
state
of
her
sacredness
inviolability
or
hold
on
the
conscience
scoffed
at
loyalty
as
a
superstition
and
consecrated
not
civil
authority
but
what
is
called
the
right
of
insurrection
under
their
teaching
the
age
sympathizes
not
with
authority
in
its
efforts
to
sustain
itself
and
protect
society
but
with
those
who
conspire
against
it
the
insurgents
rebels
revolutionists
seeking
its
destruction
the
established
government
that
seeks
to
enforce
respect
for
its
legitimate
authority
and
compel
obedience
to
the
laws
is
held
to
be
despotic
tyrannical
oppressive
and
resistance
to
it
to
be
obedience
to
god
and
a
wild
howl
rings
through
christendom
against
the
prince
that
will
not
stand
still
and
permit
the
conspirators
to
cut
his
throat
there
is
hardly
a
government
now
in
the
civilized
world
that
can
sustain
itself
for
a
moment
without
an
armed
force
sufficient
to
overawe
or
crush
the
party
or
parties
in
permanent
conspiracy
against
it
this
result
is
not
what
was
aimed
at
or
desired
but
it
is
the
logical
or
necessary
result
of
the
attempt
to
erect
the
state
on
atheistical
principles
unless
founded
on
the
divine
sovereignty
authority
can
sustain
itself
only
by
force
for
political
atheism
recognizes
no
right
but
might
no
doubt
the
politicians
have
sought
an
atheistical
or
what
is
the
same
thing
a
purely
human
basis
for
government
in
order
to
secure
an
open
field
for
human
freedom
and
activity
or
individual
or
social
progress
the
end
aimed
at
has
been
good
laudable
even
but
they
forgot
that
freedom
is
possible
only
with
authority
that
protects
it
against
license
as
well
as
against
despotism
and
that
there
can
be
no
progress
where
there
is
nothing
that
is
not
progressive
in
civil
society
two
things
are
necessary
stability
and
movement
the
human
is
the
element
of
movement
for
in
it
are
possibilities
that
can
be
only
successively
actualized
but
the
element
of
stability
can
be
found
only
in
the
divine
in
god
in
whom
there
is
no
unactualized
possibility
who
therefore
is
immovable
immutable
and
eternal
the
doctrine
that
derives
authority
from
god
through
the
people
recognizes
in
the
state
both
of
these
elements
and
provides
alike
for
stability
and
progress
this
doctrine
is
not
mere
theory
it
simply
states
the
real
order
of
things
it
is
not
telling
what
ought
to
be
but
what
is
in
the
real
order
it
only
asserts
for
civil
government
the
relation
to
god
which
nature
herself
holds
to
him
which
the
entire
universe
holds
to
the
creator
nothing
in
man
in
nature
in
the
universe
is
explicable
without
the
creative
act
of
god
for
nothing
exists
without
that
act
that
god
in
the
beginning
created
heaven
and
earth
is
the
first
principle
of
all
science
as
of
all
existences
in
politics
no
less
than
in
theology
god
and
creation
comprise
all
that
is
or
exists
and
creation
though
distinguishable
from
god
as
the
act
from
the
actor
is
inseparable
from
him
for
in
him
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
all
creatures
are
joined
to
him
by
his
creative
act
and
exist
only
as
through
that
act
they
participate
of
his
being
through
that
act
he
is
immanent
as
first
cause
in
all
creatures
and
in
every
act
of
every
creature
the
creature
deriving
from
his
creative
act
can
no
more
continue
to
exist
than
it
could
begin
to
exist
without
it
it
is
as
bad
philosophy
as
theology
to
suppose
that
god
created
the
universe
endowed
it
with
certain
laws
of
development
or
activity
wound
it
up
gave
it
a
jog
set
it
agoing
and
then
left
it
to
go
of
itself
it
can
not
go
of
itself
because
it
does
not
exist
of
itself
it
did
not
merely
not
begin
to
exist
but
it
can
not
continue
to
exist
without
the
creative
act
old
epicurus
was
a
sorry
philosopher
or
rather
no
philosopher
at
all
providence
is
as
necessary
as
creation
or
rather
providence
is
only
continuous
creation
the
creative
act
not
suspended
or
discontinued
or
not
passing
over
from
the
creature
and
returning
to
god
through
the
creative
act
man
participates
of
god
and
he
can
continue
to
exist
act
or
live
only
by
participating
through
it
of
his
divine
being
there
is
therefore
something
of
divinity
so
to
speak
in
every
creature
and
therefore
it
is
that
god
is
worshipped
in
his
works
without
idolatry
but
he
creates
substantial
existences
capable
of
acting
as
second
causes
hence
in
all
living
things
there
is
in
their
life
a
divine
element
and
a
natural
element
in
what
is
called
human
life
there
are
the
divine
and
the
human
the
divine
as
first
and
the
human
as
second
cause
precisely
what
the
doctrine
of
the
great
christian
theologians
assert
to
be
the
fact
with
all
legitimate
or
real
government
government
can
not
exist
without
the
efficacious
presence
of
god
any
more
than
man
himself
and
men
might
as
well
attempt
to
build
up
a
world
as
to
attempt
to
found
a
state
without
god
a
government
founded
on
atheistical
principles
were
less
than
a
castle
in
the
air
it
would
have
nothing
to
rest
on
would
not
be
even
so
much
as
the
baseless
fabric
of
a
vision
and
they
who
imagine
that
they
really
do
exclude
god
from
their
politics
deceive
themselves
for
they
accept
and
use
principles
which
though
they
know
it
not
are
god
what
they
call
abstract
principles
or
abstract
forms
of
reason
without
which
there
were
no
logic
are
not
abstract
but
the
real
living
god
himself
hence
government
like
man
himself
participates
of
the
divine
being
and
derived
from
god
through
the
people
it
at
the
same
time
participates
of
human
reason
and
will
thus
reconciling
authority
with
freedom
and
stability
with
progress
the
people
holding
their
authority
from
god
hold
it
not
as
an
inherent
right
but
as
a
trust
from
him
and
are
accountable
to
him
for
it
it
is
not
their
own
if
it
were
their
own
they
might
do
with
it
as
they
pleased
and
no
one
would
have
any
right
to
call
them
to
an
account
but
holding
it
as
a
trust
from
god
they
are
under
his
law
and
bound
to
exercise
it
as
that
law
prescribes
civil
rulers
holding
their
authority
from
god
through
the
people
are
accountable
for
it
both
to
him
and
to
them
if
they
abuse
it
they
are
justiciable
by
the
people
and
punishable
by
god
himself
here
is
the
guaranty
against
tyranny
oppression
or
bad
government
or
what
in
modern
times
is
called
the
responsibility
of
power
at
the
same
time
the
state
is
guarantied
against
sedition
insurrection
rebellion
revolution
by
the
elevation
of
the
civic
virtues
to
the
rank
of
religious
virtues
and
making
loyalty
a
matter
of
conscience
religion
is
brought
to
the
aid
of
the
state
not
indeed
as
a
foreign
auxiliary
but
as
integral
in
the
political
order
itself
religion
sustains
the
state
not
because
it
externally
commands
us
to
obey
the
higher
powers
or
to
be
submissive
to
the
powers
that
be
not
because
it
trains
the
people
to
habits
of
obedience
and
teaches
them
to
be
resigned
and
patient
under
the
grossest
abuses
of
power
but
because
it
and
the
state
are
in
the
same
order
and
inseparable
though
distinct
parts
of
one
and
the
same
whole
the
church
and
the
state
as
corporations
or
external
governing
bodies
are
indeed
separate
in
their
spheres
and
the
church
does
not
absorb
the
state
nor
does
the
state
the
church
but
both
are
from
god
and
both
work
to
the
same
end
and
when
each
is
rightly
understood
there
is
no
antithesis
or
antagonism
between
them
men
serve
god
in
serving
the
state
as
directly
as
in
serving
the
church
he
who
dies
on
the
fighting
for
his
country
ranks
with
him
who
dies
at
the
stake
for
his
faith
civic
virtues
are
themselves
religious
virtues
or
at
least
virtues
without
which
there
are
no
religious
virtues
since
no
man
who
loves
not
his
brother
does
or
can
love
god
the
guaranties
offered
the
state
or
authority
are
ample
because
it
has
not
only
conscience
moral
sentiment
interest
habit
and
the
via
inertia
of
the
mass
but
the
whole
physical
force
of
the
nation
at
its
command
the
individual
has
indeed
only
moral
guaranties
against
the
abuse
of
power
by
the
sovereign
people
which
may
no
doubt
sometimes
prove
insufficient
but
moral
guaranties
are
always
better
than
none
and
there
are
none
where
the
people
are
held
to
be
sovereign
in
their
own
native
right
and
might
organized
or
unorganized
inside
or
outside
of
the
constitution
as
most
modern
democratic
theorists
maintain
since
if
so
the
will
of
the
people
however
expressed
is
the
criterion
of
right
and
wrong
just
and
unjust
true
and
false
is
infallible
and
impeccable
and
no
moral
right
can
ever
be
pleaded
against
it
they
are
accountable
to
nobody
and
let
them
do
what
they
please
they
can
do
no
wrong
this
would
place
the
individual
at
the
mercy
of
the
state
and
deprive
him
of
all
right
to
complain
however
oppressed
or
cruelly
treated
this
would
establish
the
absolute
despotism
of
the
state
and
deny
every
thing
like
the
natural
rights
of
man
or
individual
and
personal
freedom
as
has
already
been
shown
now
as
men
do
take
part
in
government
and
as
men
either
individually
or
collectively
are
neither
infallible
nor
impeccable
it
is
never
to
be
expected
under
any
possible
constitution
or
form
of
government
that
authority
will
always
be
wisely
and
justly
exercised
that
wrong
will
ever
be
done
and
the
rights
of
individuals
never
in
any
instance
be
infringed
but
with
the
clear
understanding
that
all
power
is
of
god
that
the
political
sovereignty
is
vested
in
the
people
or
the
collective
body
that
the
civil
rulers
hold
from
god
through
them
and
are
responsible
to
him
through
them
and
justiciable
by
them
there
is
all
the
guaranty
against
the
abuse
of
power
by
the
nation
the
political
or
organic
people
that
the
nature
of
the
case
admits
the
nation
may
indeed
err
or
do
wrong
but
in
the
way
supposed
you
get
in
the
government
all
the
available
wisdom
and
virtue
the
nation
has
and
more
is
never
under
any
form
or
constitution
of
government
practicable
or
to
be
expected
it
is
a
maxim
with
constitutional
statesmen
that
the
king
reigns
not
governs
the
people
though
sovereign
under
god
are
not
the
government
the
government
is
in
their
name
and
by
virtue
of
authority
delegated
from
god
through
them
but
they
are
not
it
are
not
their
own
ministers
it
is
only
when
the
people
forget
this
and
undertake
to
be
their
own
ministers
and
to
manage
their
own
affairs
immediately
by
themselves
instead
of
selecting
agents
to
do
it
for
them
and
holding
their
agents
to
a
strict
account
for
their
management
that
they
are
likely
to
abuse
their
power
or
to
sanction
injustice
the
nation
may
be
misled
or
deceived
for
a
moment
by
demagogues
those
popular
courtiers
but
as
a
rule
it
is
disposed
to
be
just
and
to
respect
all
natural
rights
the
wrong
is
done
by
individuals
who
assume
to
speak
in
their
name
to
wield
their
power
and
to
be
themselves
the
state
moi
i
am
the
state
said
louis
xiv
of
france
and
while
that
was
conceded
the
french
nation
could
have
in
its
government
no
more
wisdom
or
virtue
than
he
possessed
or
at
least
no
more
than
he
could
appreciate
and
under
his
government
france
was
made
responsible
for
many
deeds
that
the
nation
would
never
have
sanctioned
if
it
bad
been
recognized
as
the
depositary
of
the
national
sovereignty
or
as
the
french
state
and
answerable
to
god
for
the
use
it
made
of
political
power
or
the
conduct
of
its
government
but
be
this
as
it
may
there
evidently
can
be
no
physical
force
in
the
nation
to
coerce
the
nation
itself
in
case
it
goes
wrong
for
if
the
sovereignty
vests
in
the
nation
only
the
nation
can
rightly
command
or
authorize
the
employment
of
force
and
all
commissions
must
run
in
its
name
written
constitutions
alone
will
avail
little
for
they
emanate
from
the
people
who
can
disregard
them
if
they
choose
and
alter
or
revoke
them
at
will
the
reliance
for
the
wisdom
and
justice
of
the
state
must
after
all
be
on
moral
guaranties
in
the
very
nature
of
the
case
there
are
and
can
be
no
other
but
these
placed
in
a
clear
light
with
an
intelligent
and
religious
people
will
seldom
be
found
insufficient
hence
the
necessity
for
the
protection
not
of
authority
simply
or
chiefly
but
of
individual
rights
and
the
liberty
of
religion
and
intelligence
in
the
nation
of
the
general
understanding
that
the
nation
holds
its
power
to
govern
as
a
trust
from
god
and
that
to
god
through
the
people
all
civil
rulers
are
strictly
responsible
let
the
mass
of
the
people
in
any
nation
lapse
into
the
ignorance
and
barbarism
of
atheism
or
lose
themselves
in
that
supreme
sophism
called
pantheism
the
grand
error
of
ancient
as
well
as
of
modern
gentilism
and
liberty
social
or
political
except
that
wild
kind
of
liberty
and
perhaps
not
even
that
should
be
excepted
which
obtains
among
savages
would
be
lost
and
irrecoverable
but
after
all
this
theory
does
not
meet
all
the
difficulties
of
the
case
it
derives
sovereignty
from
god
and
thus
asserts
the
divine
origin
of
government
in
the
sense
that
the
origin
of
nature
is
divine
it
derives
it
from
god
through
the
people
collectively
or
as
society
and
therefore
concedes
it
a
natural
human
and
social
element
which
distinguishes
it
from
pure
theocracy
it
however
does
not
explain
how
authority
comes
from
god
to
the
people
the
ruler
king
prince
or
emperor
holds
from
god
through
the
people
but
how
do
the
people
themselves
hold
from
god
mediately
or
immediately
if
mediately
what
is
the
medium
surely
not
the
people
themselves
the
people
can
no
more
be
the
medium
than
the
principle
of
their
own
sovereignty
if
immediately
then
god
governs
in
them
as
he
does
in
the
church
and
no
man
is
free
to
think
or
act
contrary
to
popular
opinion
or
in
any
case
to
question
the
wisdom
or
justice
of
any
of
the
acts
of
the
state
which
is
arriving
at
state
absolutism
by
another
process
besides
this
would
theoretically
exclude
all
human
or
natural
activity
all
human
intelligence
and
from
the
state
which
were
to
fall
into
either
pantheism
or
atheism
viii
the
right
of
government
to
govern
or
political
authority
is
derived
by
the
collective
people
or
society
from
god
through
the
law
of
nature
rulers
hold
from
god
through
the
people
or
nation
and
the
people
or
nation
hold
from
god
through
the
natural
law
how
nations
are
founded
or
constituted
or
a
particular
people
becomes
a
sovereign
political
people
invested
with
the
rights
of
society
will
be
considered
in
following
chapters
here
it
suffices
to
say
that
supposing
a
political
people
or
nation
the
sovereignty
vests
in
the
community
not
supernaturally
or
by
an
external
supernatural
appointment
as
the
clergy
hold
their
authority
but
by
the
natural
law
or
law
by
which
god
governs
the
whole
moral
creation
they
who
assert
the
origin
of
government
in
nature
are
right
so
far
as
they
derive
it
from
god
through
the
law
of
nature
and
are
wrong
only
when
they
understand
by
the
law
of
nature
the
physical
force
or
forces
of
nature
which
are
not
laws
in
the
primary
and
proper
sense
of
the
term
the
law
of
nature
is
not
the
order
or
rule
of
the
divine
action
in
nature
which
is
rightfully
called
providence
but
is
as
has
been
said
law
in
its
proper
and
primary
sense
ordained
by
the
author
of
nature
as
its
sovereign
and
supreme
lawgiver
and
binds
all
of
his
creatures
who
are
endowed
with
reason
and
and
is
called
natural
because
promulgated
through
the
reason
common
to
all
men
undoubtedly
it
was
in
the
first
instance
to
the
first
man
supernaturally
promulgated
as
it
is
republished
and
confirmed
by
christianity
as
an
integral
part
of
the
christian
code
itself
man
needs
even
yet
instruction
in
relation
to
matters
lying
within
the
range
of
natural
reason
or
else
secular
schools
colleges
and
universities
would
be
superfluous
and
manifestly
the
instructor
of
the
first
man
could
have
been
only
the
creator
himself
the
knowledge
of
the
natural
law
has
been
transmitted
from
adam
to
us
through
two
channels
reason
which
is
in
every
man
and
in
immediate
relation
with
the
creator
and
the
traditions
of
the
primitive
instruction
embodied
in
language
and
what
the
romans
call
jus
gentium
or
law
common
to
all
civilized
nations
under
this
law
whose
prescriptions
are
promulgated
through
reason
and
embodied
in
universal
jurisprudence
nations
are
providentially
constituted
and
invested
with
political
sovereignty
and
as
they
are
constituted
under
this
law
and
hold
from
god
through
it
it
defines
their
respective
rights
and
powers
their
limitation
and
their
extent
the
political
sovereignty
under
the
law
of
nature
attaches
to
the
people
not
individually
but
collectively
as
civil
or
political
society
it
is
vested
in
the
political
community
or
nation
not
in
an
individual
or
family
or
a
class
because
under
the
natural
law
all
men
are
equal
as
they
are
under
the
christian
law
and
one
man
has
in
his
own
right
no
authority
over
another
the
family
has
in
the
father
a
natural
chief
but
political
society
has
no
natural
chief
or
chiefs
the
authority
of
the
father
is
domestic
not
political
and
ceases
when
his
children
have
attained
to
majority
have
married
and
become
heads
of
families
themselves
or
have
ceased
to
make
part
of
the
paternal
household
the
recognition
of
the
authority
of
the
father
beyond
the
limits
of
his
own
household
is
if
it
ever
occurs
by
virtue
of
the
ordinance
the
consent
express
or
tacit
of
the
political
society
there
are
no
political
chiefs
and
wherever
we
find
men
claiming
or
acknowledged
to
be
such
they
are
either
usurpers
what
the
greeks
called
tyrants
or
they
are
made
such
by
the
will
or
constitution
of
the
people
or
the
nation
both
monarchy
and
aristocracy
were
no
doubt
historically
developed
from
the
authority
of
the
patriarchs
and
have
unquestionably
been
sustained
by
an
equally
false
development
of
the
right
of
property
especially
landed
property
the
owner
of
the
land
or
he
who
claimed
to
own
it
claimed
as
an
incident
of
his
ownership
the
right
to
govern
it
and
consequently
to
govern
all
who
occupied
it
but
however
valid
may
be
the
landlord
title
to
the
soil
and
it
is
doubtful
if
man
can
own
any
thing
in
land
beyond
the
usufruct
it
can
give
him
under
the
law
of
nature
no
political
right
property
like
all
natural
rights
is
entitled
by
the
natural
law
to
protection
but
not
to
govern
whether
it
shall
be
made
a
basis
of
political
power
or
not
is
a
question
of
political
prudence
to
be
determined
by
the
supreme
political
authority
it
was
the
basis
and
almost
exclusive
basis
in
the
middle
ages
under
feudalism
and
is
so
still
in
most
states
france
and
the
united
states
are
the
principal
exceptions
in
christendom
property
alone
or
coupled
with
birth
is
made
elsewhere
in
some
form
a
basis
of
political
power
and
where
made
so
by
the
sovereign
authority
it
is
legitimate
but
not
wise
nor
desirable
for
it
takes
from
the
weak
and
gives
to
the
strong
the
rich
have
in
their
riches
advantages
enough
over
the
poor
without
receiving
from
the
state
any
additional
advantage
an
aristocracy
in
the
sense
of
families
distinguished
by
birth
noble
and
patriotic
services
wealth
cultivation
refinement
taste
and
manners
is
desirable
in
every
nation
is
a
nation
ornament
and
also
its
chief
support
but
they
need
and
should
receive
no
political
recognition
they
should
form
no
privileged
class
in
the
state
or
political
society
chapter
vii
constitution
of
government
the
constitution
is
twofold
the
constitution
of
the
state
or
nation
and
the
constitution
of
the
government
the
constitution
of
the
government
is
or
is
held
to
be
the
work
of
the
nation
itself
the
constitution
of
the
state
or
the
people
of
the
state
is
in
its
origin
at
least
providential
given
by
god
himself
operating
through
historical
events
or
natural
causes
the
one
originates
in
law
the
other
in
historical
fact
the
nation
must
exist
and
exist
as
a
political
community
before
it
can
give
itself
a
constitution
and
no
state
any
more
than
an
individual
can
exist
without
a
constitution
of
some
sort
the
distinction
between
the
providential
constitution
of
the
people
and
the
constitution
of
the
government
is
not
always
made
the
illustrious
count
de
maistre
one
of
the
ablest
political
philosophers
who
wrote
in
the
last
century
or
the
first
quarter
of
the
present
in
his
work
on
the
generative
principle
of
political
constitutions
maintains
that
constitutions
are
generated
not
made
and
excludes
all
human
agency
from
their
formation
and
growth
disgusted
with
french
jacobinism
from
which
he
and
his
kin
and
country
had
suffered
so
much
and
deeply
wedded
to
monarchy
in
both
church
and
state
he
had
the
temerity
to
maintain
that
god
creates
expressly
royal
families
for
the
government
of
nations
and
that
it
is
idle
for
a
nation
to
expect
a
good
government
without
a
king
who
has
descended
from
one
of
those
divinely
created
royal
families
it
was
with
some
such
thought
most
likely
that
a
french
journalist
writing
home
from
the
united
states
congratulated
the
american
people
on
having
a
bonaparte
in
their
army
so
that
when
their
democracy
failed
as
in
a
few
years
it
was
sure
to
do
they
would
have
a
descendant
of
a
royal
house
to
be
their
king
or
emperor
alas
the
bonaparte
has
left
us
and
besides
he
was
not
the
descendant
of
a
royal
house
and
was
like
the
present
emperor
of
the
french
a
decided
parvenu
still
the
emperor
of
the
french
if
only
a
parvenu
bears
himself
right
imperially
among
sovereigns
and
has
no
peer
among
any
of
the
descendants
of
the
old
royal
families
of
europe
there
is
a
truth
however
in
de
maistre
doctrine
that
constitutions
are
generated
or
developed
not
created
de
novo
or
made
all
at
once
but
nothing
is
more
true
than
that
a
nation
can
alter
its
constitution
by
its
own
deliberate
and
voluntary
action
and
many
nations
have
done
so
and
sometimes
for
the
better
as
well
as
for
the
worse
if
the
constitution
once
given
is
fixed
and
unalterable
it
must
be
wholly
divine
and
contain
no
human
element
and
the
people
have
and
can
have
no
hand
in
their
own
government
the
fundamental
objection
to
the
theocratic
constitution
of
society
to
assume
it
is
to
transfer
to
civil
society
founded
by
the
ordinary
providence
of
god
the
constitution
of
the
church
founded
by
his
gracious
or
supernatural
providence
and
to
maintain
that
the
divine
sovereignty
governs
in
civil
society
immediately
and
supernaturally
as
in
the
spiritual
society
but
such
is
not
the
fact
god
governs
the
nation
by
the
nation
itself
through
its
own
reason
and
de
maistre
is
right
only
as
to
the
constitution
the
nation
starts
with
and
as
to
the
control
which
that
constitution
necessarily
exerts
over
the
constitutional
changes
the
nation
can
successfully
introduce
the
disciples
of
jean
jacques
rousseau
recognize
no
providential
constitution
and
call
the
written
instrument
drawn
up
by
a
convention
of
sovereign
individuals
the
constitution
and
the
only
constitution
both
of
the
people
and
the
government
prior
to
its
adoption
there
is
no
government
no
state
no
political
community
or
authority
antecedently
to
it
the
people
are
an
inorganic
mass
simply
individuals
without
any
political
or
national
solidarity
these
individuals
they
suppose
come
together
in
their
own
native
right
and
might
organize
themselves
into
a
political
community
give
themselves
a
constitution
and
draw
up
and
vote
rules
for
their
government
as
a
number
of
individuals
might
meet
in
a
public
hall
and
resolve
themselves
into
a
temperance
society
or
a
debating
club
this
might
do
very
well
if
the
state
were
like
the
temperance
society
or
debating
club
a
simple
voluntary
association
which
men
are
free
to
join
or
not
as
they
please
and
which
they
are
bound
to
obey
no
farther
and
no
longer
than
suits
their
convenience
but
the
state
is
a
power
a
sovereignty
speaks
to
all
within
its
jurisdiction
with
an
imperative
voice
commands
and
may
use
physical
force
to
compel
obedience
when
not
voluntarily
yielded
men
are
born
its
subjects
and
no
one
can
withdraw
from
it
without
its
express
or
tacit
permission
unless
for
causes
that
would
justify
resistance
to
its
authority
the
right
of
subjects
to
denationalize
or
expatriate
themselves
except
to
escape
a
tyranny
or
an
oppression
which
would
forfeit
the
rights
of
power
and
warrant
forcible
resistance
to
it
does
not
exist
any
more
than
the
right
of
foreigners
to
become
citizens
unless
by
the
consent
and
authorization
of
the
sovereign
for
the
citizen
or
subject
belongs
to
the
state
and
is
bound
to
it
the
solidarity
of
the
individuals
composing
the
population
of
a
territory
or
country
under
one
political
head
is
a
truth
but
the
solidarity
of
peoples
irrespective
of
the
government
or
political
authority
of
their
respective
countries
so
eloquently
preached
a
few
years
since
by
the
hungarian
kossuth
is
not
only
a
falsehood
but
a
falsehood
destructive
of
all
government
and
of
all
political
organization
kossuth
doctrine
supposes
the
people
or
the
populations
of
all
countries
are
irrespective
of
their
governments
bound
together
in
solido
each
for
all
and
all
for
each
and
therefore
not
only
free
but
bound
wherever
they
find
a
population
struggling
nominally
for
liberty
against
its
government
to
rush
with
arms
in
their
hands
to
its
assistance
a
doctrine
clearly
incompatible
with
any
recognition
of
political
authority
or
territorial
rights
peoples
or
nations
commune
with
each
other
only
through
the
national
authorities
and
when
the
state
proclaims
neutrality
or
all
its
subjects
are
bound
to
be
neutral
and
to
abstain
from
all
intervention
on
either
side
there
may
be
and
indeed
there
is
a
solidarity
more
or
less
distinctly
recognized
of
christian
nations
but
of
the
populations
with
and
through
their
governments
not
without
them
still
more
strict
is
the
solidarity
of
all
the
individuals
of
one
and
the
same
nation
these
are
all
bound
together
all
for
each
and
each
for
all
the
individual
is
born
into
society
and
under
the
government
and
without
the
authority
of
the
government
which
represents
all
and
each
he
can
not
release
himself
from
his
obligations
the
state
is
then
by
no
means
a
voluntary
association
every
one
born
or
adopted
into
it
is
bound
to
it
and
can
not
without
its
permission
withdraw
from
it
unless
as
just
said
it
is
manifest
that
he
can
have
under
it
no
protection
for
his
natural
rights
as
a
man
more
especially
for
his
rights
of
conscience
this
is
vattel
doctrine
and
the
dictate
of
common
sense
the
constitution
drawn
up
ordained
and
established
by
a
nation
for
itself
is
a
law
the
organic
or
fundamental
law
if
you
will
but
a
law
and
is
and
must
be
the
act
of
the
sovereign
power
that
sovereign
power
must
exist
before
it
can
act
and
it
can
not
exist
if
vested
in
the
people
or
nation
without
a
constitution
or
without
some
sort
of
political
organization
of
the
people
or
nation
there
must
then
be
for
every
state
or
nation
a
constitution
anterior
to
the
constitution
which
the
nation
gives
itself
and
from
which
the
one
it
gives
itself
derives
all
its
vitality
and
legal
force
logic
and
historical
facts
are
here
as
elsewhere
coincident
for
creation
and
providence
are
simply
the
expression
of
the
supreme
logic
the
logos
by
whom
all
things
are
made
nations
have
originated
in
various
ways
but
history
records
no
instance
of
a
nation
existing
as
an
inorganic
mass
organizing
itself
into
a
political
community
every
nation
at
its
first
appearance
above
the
horizon
is
found
to
have
an
organization
of
some
sort
this
is
evident
from
the
only
ways
in
which
history
shows
us
nations
originating
these
ways
are
the
union
of
families
in
the
tribe
the
union
of
tribes
in
the
nation
the
migration
of
families
tribes
or
nations
in
search
of
new
settlements
colonization
military
agricultural
commercial
industrial
religious
or
penal
war
and
conquest
the

and
independence
of

intermingling
of
the
conquerors
and
conquered
and
by
amalgamation
forming
a
new
people
these
are
all
the
ways
known
to
history
and
in
none
of
these
ways
does
a
people
absolutely
destitute
of
all
organization
constitute
itself
a
state
and
institute
and
carry
on
civil
government
the
family
the
tribe
the
colony
are
if
incomplete
yet
incipient
states
or
inchoate
nations
with
an
organization
individuality
and
a
centre
of
social
life
of
their
own
the
families
and
tribes
that
migrate
in
search
of
new
settlements
carry
with
them
their

and

and
retain
it
for
a
long
time
the

broken
up
by

under

in

till
the

of

in

till

they
carry

which
when

and

render

war
and
conquest
effect
great
national
changes
but
do
not
strictly
speaking
create
new
states
they
simply
extend
and
consolidate
the
power
of
the
conquering
state
provinces
revolt
and
become
independent
states
or
nations
but
only
when
they
have
previously
existed
as
such
and
have
retained
the
tradition
of
their
old
constitution
and
independence
or
when
the
administration
has
erected
them
into
real
though
dependent
political
communities
a
portion
of
the
people
of
a
state
not
so
erected
or
organized
that
has
in
no
sense
had
a
distinct
political
existence
of
its
own
has
never
separated
from
the
national
body
and
formed
a
new
and
independent
nation
it
can
not
revolt
it
may
rise
up
against
the
government
and
either
revolutionize
and
take
possession
of
the
state
or
be
put
down
by
the
government
as
an
insurrection
the
amalgamation
of
the
conquering
and
the
conquered
forms
a
new
people
and
modifies
the
institutions
of
both
but
does
not
necessarily
form
a
new
nation
or
political
community
the
english
of
are
very
different
from
both
the
normans
and
the
saxons
or
of
the
time
of
richard
coeur
de
lion
but
they
constitute
the
same
state
or
political
community
england
is
still
england
the
roman
empire
conquered
by
the
northern
barbarians
has
been
cut
up
into
several
separate
and
independent
nations
but
because
its
several
provinces
had
prior
to
their
conquest
by
the
roman
arms
been
independent
nations
or
tribes
and
more
especially
because
the
conquerors
themselves
were
divided
into
several
distinct
nations
or
confederacies
if
the
barbarians
had
been
united
in
a
single
nation
or
state
the
roman
empire
most
likely
would
have
changed
masters
indeed
but
have
retained
its
unity
and
its
constitution
for
the
germanic
nations
that
finally
seated
themselves
on
its
ruins
had
no
wish
to
destroy
its
name
or
nationality
for
they
were
themselves
more
than
half
romanized
before
conquering
rome
but
the
new
nations
into
which
the
empire
has
been
divided
have
never
been
at
any
moment
without
political
or
governmental
organization
continued
from
the
constitution
of
the
conquering
tribe
or
nation
modified
more
or
less
by
what
was
retained
from
the
empire
it
is
not
pretended
that
the
constitutions
of
states
can
not
be
altered
or
that
every
people
starts
with
a
constitution
fully
developed
as
would
seem
to
be
the
doctrine
of
de
maistre
the
constitution
of
the
family
is
rather
economical
than
political
and
the
tribe
is
far
from
being
a
fully
developed
state
strictly
speaking
the
state
the
modern
equivalent
for
the
city
of
the
greeks
and
romans
was
not
fully
formed
till
men
began
to
build
and
live
in
cities
and
became
fixed
to
a
national
territory
but
in
the
first
place
the
eldest
born
of
the
human
race
we
are
told
built
a
city
and
even
in
cities
we
find
traces
of
the
family
and
tribal
organization
long
after
their
municipal
existence
in
athens
down
to
the
macedonian
conquest
and
in
rome
down
to
the
establishment
of
the
empire
and
in
the
second
place
the
pastoral
nations
though
they
have
not
precisely
the
city
or
state
organization
yet
have
a
national
organization
and
obey
a
national
authority
strictly
speaking
no
pastoral
nation
has
a
civil
or
political
constitution
but
they
have
what
in
our
modern
tongues
can
be
expressed
by
no
other
term
the
feudal
regime
which
was
in
full
vigor
even
in
europe
from
the
tenth
to
the
close
of
the
fourteenth
century
had
nothing
to
do
with
cities
and
really
recognized
no
state
proper
yet
who
hesitates
to
speak
of
it
as
a
civil
or
political
system
though
a
very
imperfect
one
the
civil
order
as
it
now
exists
was
not
fully
developed
in
the
early
ages
for
a
long
time
the
national
organizations
bore
unmistakable
traces
of
having
been
developed
from
the
patriarchal
and
modelled
from
the
family
or
tribe
as
they
do
still
in
all
the
world
religion
itself
before
the
incarnation
bore
traces
of
the
same
organization
even
with
the
jews
religion
was
transmitted
and
diffused
not
as
under
christianity
by
conversion
but
by
natural
generation
or
family
adoption
with
all
the
gentile
tribes
or
nations
it
was
the
same
at
first
the
father
was
both
priest
and
king
and
when
the
two
offices
were
separated
the
priests
formed
a
distinct
and
hereditary
class
or
caste
rejected
by
christianity
which
as
we
have
seen
admits
priests
only
after
the
order
of
melchisedech
the
jews
had
the
synagogue
and
preserved
the
primitive
revelation
in
its
purity
and
integrity
but
the
greeks
and
romans
more
fully
than
any
other
ancient
nations
preserved
or
developed
the
political
order
that
best
conforms
to
the
christian
religion
and
christianity
it
is
worthy
of
remark
followed
in
the
track
of
the
roman
armies
and
it
gains
a
permanent
establishment
only
where
was
planted
or
where
it
is
able
to
plant
the
civilization
the
republics
were
hardly
less
a
schoolmaster
to
bring
the
world
to
christ
in
the
civil
order
than
the
jewish
nation
was
to
bring
it
to
him
in
the
spiritual
order
or
in
faith
and
worship
in
the
christian
order
nothing
is
by
hereditary
descent
but
every
thing
is
by
election
of
grace
the
christian
dispensation
is
teleological
palingenesiac
and
the
whole
order
prior
to
the
incarnation
was
initial
genesiac
and
continued
by
natural
generation
as
it
is
still
in
all
nations
and
tribes
outside
of
christendom
no
people
is
a
civilized
people
and
indeed
the
human
race
seems
not
anywhere
prior
to
the
incarnation
to
have
attained
to
its
majority
and
it
is
perhaps
because
the
race
were
not
prepared
for
it
that
the
word
was
not
sooner
incarnated
he
came
only
in
the
fulness
of
time
when
the
world
was
ready
to
receive
him
the
providential
constitution
is
in
fact
that
with
which
the
nation
is
born
and
is
as
long
as
the
nation
exists
the
real
living
and
efficient
constitution
of
the
state
it
is
the
source
of
the
vitality
of
the
state
that
which
controls
or
governs
its
action
and
determines
its
destiny
the
constitution
which
a
nation
is
said
to
give
itself
is
never
the
constitution
of
the
state
but
is
the
law
ordained
by
the
state
for
the
government
instituted
under
it
thomas
paine
would
admit
nothing
to
be
the
constitution
but
a
written
document
which
he
could
fold
up
and
put
in
his
pocket
or
file
away
in
a
the
abbe
sieyes
pronounced
politics
a
science
which
he
had
finished
and
he
was
ready
to
turn
you
out
constitutions
to
order
with
no
other
defect
than
that
they
had
as
carlyle
wittily
says
no
feet
and
could
not
go
many
in
the
last
century
and
some
perhaps
in
the
present
for
folly
as
well
as
wisdom
has
her
heirs
confounded
the
written
instrument
with
the
constitution
itself
no
constitution
can
be
written
on
paper
or
engrossed
on
parchment
what
the
convention
may
agree
upon
draw
up
and
the
people
ratify
by
their
votes
is
no
constitution
for
it
is
extrinsic
to
the
nation
not
inherent
and
living
in
it
is
at
best
legislative
instead
of
constitutive
the
famous
magna
charta
drawn
up
by
cardinal
langton
and
wrung
from
john
lackland
by
the
english
barons
at
runnymede
was
no
constitution
of
england
till
long
after
the
date
of
its
concession
and
even
then
was
no
constitution
of
the
state
but
a
set
of
restrictions
on
power
the
constitution
is
the
intrinsic
or
inherent
and
actual
constitution
of
the
people
or
political
community
itself
that
which
makes
the
nation
what
it
is
and
distinguishes
it
from
every
other
nation
and
varies
as
nations
themselves
vary
from
one
another
the
constitution
of
the
state
is
not
a
theory
nor
is
it
drawn
up
and
established
in
accordance
with
any
preconceived
theory
what
is
theoretic
in
a
constitution
is
unreal
the
constitutions
conceived
by
philosophers
in
their
closets
are
constitutions
only
of
utopia
or
dreamland
this
world
is
not
governed
by
abstractions
for
abstractions
are
nullities
only
the
concrete
is
real
and
only
the
real
or
actual
has
vitality
or
force
the
french
people
adopted
constitution
after
constitution
of
the
most
approved
pattern
and
amid
bonfires
beating
of
drums
sound
of
trumpets
roar
of
musketry
and
thunder
of
artillery
swore
no
doubt
sincerely
as
well
as
enthusiastically
to
observe
them
but
all
to
no
effect
for
they
had
no
authority
for
the
nation
no
hold
on
its
affections
and
formed
no
element
of
its
life
the
english
are
great
for
other
nations
they
fancy
that
a
constitution
fashioned
after
their
own
will
fit
any
nation
that
can
be
persuaded
wheedled
or
bullied
into
trying
it
on
but
unhappily
all
that
have
tried
it
on
have
found
it
only
an
embarrassment
or
encumbrance
the
doctor
might
as
well
attempt
to
give
an
individual
a
new
constitution
or
the
constitution
of
another
man
as
the
statesman
to
give
a
nation
any
other
constitution
than
that
which
it
has
and
with
which
it
is
born
the
whole
history
of
europe
since
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
proves
this
thesis
the
barbarian
conquest
of
rome
introduced
into
the
nations
founded
on
the
site
of
the
empire
a
double
constitution
the
barbaric
and
the
civil
the
germanic
and
the
roman
in
the
west
and
the
tartaric
or
turkish
and
the
in
the
east
the
key
to
all
modern
history
is
in
the
mutual
struggles
of
these
two
constitutions
and
the
interests
respectively
associated
with
them
which
created
two
societies
on
the
same
territory
and
for
the
most
part
under
the
same
national
denomination
the
barbaric
was
the
constitution
of
the
conquerors
they
had
the
power
the
government
rank
wealth
and
fashion
were
reinforced
down
to
the
tenth
century
by
fresh
hordes
of
barbarians
and
had
even
brought
the
external
ecclesiastical
society
to
a
very
great
extent
into
harmony
with
itself
the
pope
became
a
feudal
sovereign
and
the
bishops
and
mitred
abbots
feudal
princes
and
barons
yet
after
eight
hundred
years
of
fierce
struggle
the
roman
constitution
got
the
upper
hand
and
the
barbaric
constitution
as
far
as
it
could
not
be
assimilated
to
the
roman
was
eliminated
the
original
empire
of
the
west
is
now
as
thoroughly
roman
in
its
constitution
its
laws
and
its
civilization
as
it
ever
was
under
any
of
its
christian
emperors
before
the
barbarian
conquest
the
same
process
is
going
on
in
the
east
though
it
has
not
advanced
so
far
having
begun
there
several
centuries
later
and
the
constitution
was
far
feebler
there
than
in
the
west
at
the
epoch
of
the
conquest
the
germanic
tribes
that
conquered
the
west
had
long
had
close
relations
with
the
empire
had
served
as
its
allies
and
even
in
its
armies
and
were
partially
romanized
most
of
their
chiefs
had
received
a
roman
culture
and
their
early
conversion
to
the
christian
faith
facilitated
the
revival
and
permanence
of
the
old
roman
constitution
in
the
east
it
was
different
the
conquerors
had
no
touch
of
roman
civilization
and
followers
of
the
prophet
they
were
animated
with
an
intense
hatred
which
after
the
conquest
was
changed
into
a
superb
contempt
of
christians
and
romans
they
had
their
civil
constitution
in
the
koran
and
the
koran
in
its
principles
doctrines
and
spirit
is
exclusive
and
profoundly
intolerant
the
constitution
was
always
much
weaker
in
the
east
and
had
far
greater
obstacles
to
overcome
there
than
in
the
west
yet
it
has
survived
the
shock
of
the
conquest
throughout
the
limits
of
the
ancient
empire
of
the
east
the
barbaric
constitution
has
received
and
is
daily
receiving
rude
blows
and
but
as
reenforced
by
barbarians
lying
outside
of
the
boundaries
of
that
empire
would
be
no
longer
able
to
sustain
itself
the
greek
or
christian
populations
of
the
empire
are
no
longer
in
danger
of
being
exterminated
or
absorbed
by
the
mohammedan
state
or
population
they
are
the
only
living
and
progressive
people
of
the
ottoman
empire
and
their
complete
success
in
absorbing
or
expelling
the
turk
is
only
a
question
of
time
they
will
in
all
present
probability
reestablish
a
christian
and
roman
east
in
much
less
time
from
the
fall
of
constantinople
in
than
it
took
the
west
from
the
fall
of
rome
in
to
put
an
end
to
the
feudal
or
barbaric
constitution
founded
by
its
germanic
invaders
indeed
the
roman
constitution
laws
and
civilization
not
only
gain
the
mastery
in
the
nations
seated
within
the
limits
of
the
old
roman
empire
but
extend
their
power
through
out
the
whole
civilized
world
the
civilization
is
in
fact
the
only
civilization
now
recognized
and
nations
are
accounted
civilized
only
in
proportion
as
they
are
romanized
and
christianized
the
roman
law
as
found
in
the
institutes
pandects
and
novellae
of
justinian
or
the
corpus
legis
civilis
is
the
basis
of
the
law
and
jurisprudence
of
all
christendom
the
civilization
called
not
improperly
christian
civilization
is
the
only
progressive
civilization
the
old
feudal
system
remains
in
england
little
more
than
an
empty
name
the
king
is
only
the
first
magistrate
of
the
kingdom
and
the
house
of
lords
is
only
an
hereditary
senate
austria
is
hard
at
work
in
the
roman
direction
and
finds
her
chief
obstacle
to
success
in
hungary
with
the
magyars
whose
feudalism
retains
almost
the
full
vigor
of
the
middle
ages
russia
is
moving
in
the
same
direction
and
prussia
and
the
smaller
germanic
states
obey
the
same
impulse
indeed
rome
has
survived
the
conquest
has
conquered
her
conquerors
and
now
invades
every
region
from
which
they
came
the
roman
empire
may
be
said
to
be
acknowledged
and
obeyed
in
lands
lying
far
beyond
the
farthest
limits
reached
by
the
roman
eagles
and
to
be
more
truly
the
mistress
of
the
world
than
under
augustus
trajan
or
the
antonines
nothing
can
stand
before
the
christian
and
romanized
nations
and
all
pagandom
and
mohammedom
combined
are
too
weak
to
resist
their
onward
march
all
modern
european
revolutions
result
only
in
reviving
the
roman
empire
whatever
the
motives

passions
or

that
initiate

of
the

system
that
masters
them
the
reason

france
is
more
completely
and
sincerely
roman
than
any
other
nation
the
revolutions
that
have
shaken
the
world
have
resulted
in
eliminating
the
barbaric
elements
she
had
retained
and
clearing
away
all
obstacles
to
the
complete
triumph
of
imperial
rome
napoleon
iii
is
for
france
what
augustus
was
for
rome
the
revolutions
in
spain
and
italy
have
only
swept
away
the
relics
of
the
barbaric
constitution
and
aided
the
revival
of
roman
imperialism
in
no
country
do
the
revolutionists
succeed
in
establishing
their
own
theories
caesar
remains
master
of
the
field
even
in
the
united
states
a
revolution
undertaken
in
favor
of
the
barbaric
system
has
resulted
in
the
destruction
of
what
remained
of
that
system
in
sweeping
away
the
last
relics
of
disintegrating
feudalism
and
in
the
complete
establishment
of
the
system
with
important
improvements
in
the
new
world
the
roman
system
is
republican
in
the
broad
sense
of
the
term
because
under
it
power
is
never
an
estate
never
the
private
for
the
public
good
as
it
existed
under
the
caesars
and
is
revived
in
modern
times
whether
under
the
imperial
or
the
democratic
form
it
no
doubt
tends
to
centralism
to
the
concentration
of
all
the
powers
and
forces
of
the
state
in
one
central
government
from
which
all
local
authorities
and
institutions
emanate
wise
men
oppose
it
as
affording
no
guaranties
to
individual
liberty
against
the
abuses
of
power
this
it
may
not
do
but
the
remedy
is
not
in
feudalism
the
feudal
lord
holds
his
authority
as
an
estate
and
has
over
the
people
under
him
all
the
power
of
caesar
and
all
the
rights
of
the
proprietor
he
indeed
has
a
guaranty
against
his
sometimes
a
more
effective
guaranty
than
his
has
against
him
but
against
his
centralized
power
his
vassals
and
serfs
have
only
the
guaranty
that
a
slave
has
against
his
owner
feudalism
is
alike
hostile
to
the
freedom
of
public
authority
and
of
the
people
it
is
essentially
a
disintegrating
element
in
the
nation
it
breaks
the
unity
and
individuality
of
the
state
embarrasses
the
sovereign
and
guards
against
the
abuse
of
public
authority
by
overpowering
and
suppressing
it
every
feudal
lord
is
a
more
thorough
despot
in
his
own
domain
than
caesar
ever
was
or
could
be
in
the
empire
and
the
monarch
even
if
strong
enough
is
yet
not
competent
to
intervene
between
him
and
his
people
any
more
than
the
general
government
in
the
united
states
was
to
intervene
between
the
negro
slave
and
his
master
the
great
vassals
of
the
crown
singly
or
if
not
singly
in
combination
and
they
could
always
combine
in
the
interest
of
their
order
were
too
strong
for
the
king
or
to
be
brought
under
any
public
authority
and
could
issue
from
their
fortified
castles
and
rob
and
plunder
to
their
hearts
content
with
none
to
call
them
to
an
account
under
the
most
thoroughly
centralized
government
there
is
far
more
liberty
for
the
people
and
a
far
greater
security
for
person
and
property
except
in
the
case
of
the
feudal
nobles
themselves
than
was
even
dreamed
of
while
the
feudal
regime
was
in
full
vigor
nobles
were
themselves
free
it
is
conceded
but
not
the
people
the
king
was
too
weak
too
restricted
in
his
action
by
the
feudal
constitution
to
reach
them
and
the
higher
clergy
were
ex
officio
sovereigns
princes
barons
or
feudal
lords
and
were
led
by
their
private
interests
to
act
with
the
feudal
nobility
save
when
that
nobility
threatened
the
temporalities
of
the
church
the
only
reliance
under
god
left
in
feudal
times
to
the
poor
people
was
in
the
lower
ranks
of
the
clergy
especially
of
the
regular
clergy
all
the
great
german
emperors
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
who
saw
the
evils
of
feudalism
and
attempted
to
break
it
up
and
revive
imperial
rome
became
involved
in
quarrels
with
the
chiefs
of
the
religious
society
and
failed
because
the
interest
of
the
popes
as
feudal
sovereigns
and
italian
princes
and
the
interests
of
the
dignified
clergy
were
for
the
time
bound
up
with
the
feudal
society
though
their
roman
culture
and
civilization
made
them
at
heart
hostile
to
it
the
student
of
history
however
strong
his
filial
affection
towards
the
visible
head
of
the
church
can
not
help
admiring
the
grandeur
of
the
political
views
of
frederic
the
second
the
greatest
and
last
of
the
hohenstaufen
or
refrain
from
dropping
a
tear
over
his
sad
failure
he
had
great
faults
as
a
man
but
he
had
rare
genius
as
a
statesman
and
it
is
some
consolation
to
know
that
he
died
a
christian
death
in
charity
with
all
men
after
having
received
the
last
sacraments
of
his
religion
the
popes
under
the
circumstances
were
no
doubt
justified
in
the
policy
they
pursued
for
the
swabian
emperors
failed
to
respect
the
acknowledged
rights
of
the
church
and
to
remember
their
own
incompetency
in
spirituals
but
evidently
their
political
views
and
aims
were
liberal
and
worthy
of
admiration
their
success
if
it
could
have
been
effected
without
lesion
to
the
church
would
have
set
europe
forward
some
two
or
three
hundred
years
and
probably
saved
it
from
the
schisms
of
the
fourteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
but
it
is
easy
to
be
wise
after
the
event
the
fact
is
that
during
the
period
when
feudalism
was
in
full
vigor
the
king
was
merely
a
shadow
the
people
found
their
only
consolation
in
religion
and
their
chief
protectors
in
the
monks
who
mingled
with
them
saw
their
sufferings
and
sympathized
with
them
consoled
them
carried
their
cause
to
the
castle
before
the
feudal
lord
and
lady
and
did
thank
god
do
something
to
keep
alive
religious
sentiments
and
convictions
in
the
bosom
of
the
feudal
society
itself
whatever
opinions
may
be
formed
of
the
monastic
orders
in
relation
to
the
present
this
much
is
certain
that
they
were
the
chief
civilizers
of
europe
and
the
chief
agents
in
delivering
european
society
from
feudal
barbarism
the
aristocracy
have
been
claimed
as
the
natural
allies
of
the
throne
but
history
proves
them
to
be
its
natural
enemies
whenever
it
can
not
be
used
in
their
service
and
kings
do
not
consent
to
be
their
ministers
and
to
do
their
bidding
a
political
aristocracy
has
at
heart
only
the
interests
of
its
order
and
pursues
no
line
of
policy
but
the
extension
or
preservation
of
its
privileges
having
little
to
gain
and
much
to
lose
it
opposes
every
political
change
that
would
either
strengthen
the
crown
or
elevate
the
people
the
nobility
in
the
french
revolution
were
the
first
to
desert
both
the
king
and
the
kingdom
and
kings
have
always
found
their
readiest
and
firmest
allies
in
the
people
the
people
in
europe
have
no
such
bitter
feelings
towards
royalty
as
they
have
towards
the
feudal
nobility
for
kings
have
never
so
grievously
oppressed
them
in
rome
the
patrician
order
opposed
alike
the
emperor
and
the
people
except
when
they
as
chivalric
nobles
sometimes
will
do
turned
courtiers
or
demagogues
they
were
the
people
of
rome
and
the
provinces
that
sustained
the
emperors
and
they
were
the
emperors
who
sustained
the
people
and
gave
to
the
provincials
the
privileges
of
roman
citizens
guaranties
against
excessive
centralism
are
certainly
needed
but
the
statesman
will
not
seek
them
in
the
feudal
organization
of
society
in
a
political
aristocracy
whether
founded
on
birth
or
private
wealth
nor
in
a
privileged
class
of
any
sort
better
trust
caesar
than
brutus
or
even
cato
nor
will
he
seek
them
in
the
antagonism
of
interests
intended
to
neutralize
or
balance
each
other
as
in
the
english
constitution
this
was
the
great
error
of
calhoun
no
man
saw
more
clearly
than
calhoun
the
utter
worthlessness
of
simple
paper
constitutions
on
which
jefferson
placed
such
implicit
reliance
or
that
the
real
constitution
is
in
the
state
itself
in
the
manner
in
which
the
people
themselves
are
organized
but
his
reliance
was
in
constituting
as
powers
in
the
state
the
several
popular
interests
that
exist
and
pitting
them
against
each
other
the
famous
system
of
checks
and
balances
of
english
states
men
he
was
led
to
this
because
he
distrusted
power
and
was
more
intention
guarding
against
its
abuses
than
on
providing
for
its
free
vigorous
and
healthy
action
going
on
the
principle
that
that
is
the
best
government
which
governs
least
but
if
the
opposing
interests
could
be
made
to
balance
one
another
perfectly
the
result
would
be
an
equilibrium
in
which
power
would
be
brought
to
a
and
if
not
the
stronger
would
succeed
and
swallow
up
all
the
rest
the
theory
of
checks
and
balances
is
admirable
if
the
object
be
to
trammel
power
and
to
have
as
little
power
in
the
government
as
possible
but
it
is
a
theory
which
is
born
from
passions
engendered
by
the
struggle
against
despotism
or
arbitrary
power
not
from
a
calm
and
philosophical
appreciation
of
government
itself
the
english
have
not
succeeded
in
establishing
their
theory
for
after
all
their
constitution
does
not
work
so
well
as
they
pretend
the
landed
interest
controls
at
one
time
and
the
mercantile
and
manufacturing
interest
at
another
they
do
not
perfectly
balance
one
another
and
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
that
the
mercantile
and
manufacturing
interest
combined
with
the
moneyed
interest
is
henceforth
to
predominate
the
aim
of
the
real
statesman
is
to
organize
all
the
interests
and
forces
of
the
state
dialectically
so
that
they
shall
unite
to
add
to
its
strength
and
work
together
harmoniously
for
the
common
good
chapter
viii
constitution
of
government
concluded
though
the
constitution
of
the
people
is
congenital
like
the
constitution
of
an
individual
and
can
not
be
radically
changed
without
the
destruction
of
the
state
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
it
is
wholly
withdrawn
from
the
action
of
the
reason
and
of
the
nation
nor
from
that
of
individual
statesmen
all
created
things
are
subject
to
the
law
of
development
and
may
be
developed
either
in
a
good
sense
or
in
a
bad
that
is
may
be
either
completed
or
corrupted
all
the
possibilities
of
the
national
constitution
are
given
originally
in
the
birth
of
the
nation
as
all
the
possibilities
of
mankind
were
given
in
the
first
man
the
germ
must
be
given
in
the
original
constitution
but
in
all
constitutions
there
is
more
than
one
element
and
the
several
elements
maybe
developed
pari
passu
or
unequally
one
having
the
ascendency
and
suppressing
the
rest
in
the
original
constitution
of
rome
the
patrician
element
was
dominant
showing
that
the
patriarchal
organization
of
society
still
retained
no
little
force
the
king
was
only
the
presiding
officer
of
the
senate
and
the
leader
of
the
army
in
war
his
civil
functions
corresponded
very
nearly
to
those
of
a
mayor
of
the
city
of
new
york
where
all
the
effective
power
is
in
the
aldermen
common
council
and
heads
of
departments
except
in
name
he
was
little
else
than
a
pageant
the
kings
no
doubt
labored
to
develop
and
extend
the
royal
element
of
the
constitution
this
was
natural
and
it
was
equally
natural
that
they
should
be
resisted
by
the
patricians
hence
when
the
tarquins
or
etruscan
dynasty
undertook
to
be
kings
in
fact
as
well
as
in
name
and
seemed
likely
to
succeed
the
patricians
expelled
them
and
supplied
their
place
by
two
consuls
annually
elected
here
was
a
modification
but
no
real
change
of
the
constitution
the
effective
power
as
before
remained
in
the
senate
but
there
was
from
early
times
a
plebeian
element
in
the
population
of
the
city
though
forming
at
first
no
part
of
the
political
people
their
origin
is
not
very
certain
nor
their
original
position
in
the
city
historians
give
different
accounts
of
them
but
that
they
should
as
they
increased
in
numbers
wealth
and
importance
demand
admission
into
the
political
society
religious
or
solemn
marriage
a
voice
in
the
government
and
the
faculty
of
holding
civil
and
military
offices
was
only
in
the
order
of
regular
development
at
first
the
patricians
fought
them
and
failing
to
subdue
them
by
force
effected
a
compromise
and
bought
up
their
leaders
the
concession
which
followed
of
the
tribunitial
veto
was
only
a
further
development
by
that
veto
the
plebeians
gained
no
initiative
no
positive
power
indeed
but
their
tribunes
by
interposing
it
could
stop
the
proceedings
of
the
government
they
could
not
propose
the
measures
they
liked
but
they
could
prevent
the
legal
adoption
of
measures
they
disliked
a
faculty
calhoun
asserted
for
the
several
states
of
the
american
union
in
his
doctrine
of
nullification
or
state
veto
as
he
called
it
it
was
simply
an
obstructive
power
but
from
a
power
to
obstruct
legislative
action
to
the
power
to
originate
or
propose
it
and
force
the
senate
to
adopt
it
through
fear
of
the
veto
of
measures
the
patricians
had
at
heart
was
only
a
still
further
development
this
gained
the
exclusively
patrician
constitution
had
disappeared
and
marius
the
head
of
a
great
plebeian
house
could
be
elected
consul
and
the
plebeians
in
turn
threaten
to
become
predominant
which
sylla
or
sulla
as
dictator
seeing
tried
in
vain
to
prevent
the
dictator
was
provided
for
in
the
original
constitution
retain
the
dictatorship
for
a
time
strengthen
the
plebeian
element
by
ruthless
proscriptions
of
patricians
and
by
recruits
from
the
provinces
unite
the
tribunitial
pontifical
and
military
powers
in
the
imperator
designated
by
the
army
all
elements
existing
in
the
constitution
from
an
early
day
and
already
developed
in
the
roman
state
and
you
have
the
imperial
constitution
which
retained
to
the
last
the
senate
and
consuls
though
with
less
and
less
practical
power
these
changes
are
very
great
but
are
none
of
them
radical
dating
from
the
recognition
of
the
plebs
as
pertaining
to
the
roman
people
they
are
normal
developments
not
corruptions
and
the
transition
from
the
consular
republic
to
the
imperial
was
unquestionably
a
real
social
and
political
progress
and
yet
the
roman
people
had
they
chosen
could
have
given
a
different
direction
to
the
developments
of
their
constitution
there
was
providence
in
the
course
of
events
but
no
fatalism
sulla
was
a
true
patrician
a
blind
partisan
of
the
past
he
sought
to
arrest
the
plebeian
development
led
by
marius
and
to
restore
the
exclusively
patrician
government
but
it
was
too
late
his
proscriptions
confiscations
butcheries
cruelties
which
anticipated
and
surpassed
those
of
the
french
revolution
of
availed
nothing
the
marian
or
plebeian
movement
apparently
checked
for
a
moment
resumed
its
march
with
renewed
vigor
under
julius
and
triumphed
at
pharsalia
in
vain
cicero
only
accidentally
associated
with
the
patrician
party
which

brutus

the

the
plebeian

moves
on
with
resistless
force
triumphs
anew
at
philippi
and
young
octavius
avenges
the
murder
of
his

and
proves
to
the

that
the

of

thus
far
the
developments
were
normal
and
advanced
civilization
but
rome
still
retained
the
barbaric
element
of
slavery
in
her
bosom
and
had
conquered
more
barbaric
nations
than
she
had
assimilated
these
nations
she
at
first
governed
as
tributary
states
with
their
own
constitutions
and
national
chiefs
afterwards
as
roman
provinces
by
her
own
proconsuls
and
prefects
when
the
emperors
threw
open
the
gates
of
the
city
to
the
provincials
and
conceded
them
the
rights
and
privileges
of
roman
citizens
they
introduced
not
only
a
foreign
element
into
the
state
destitute
of
roman
patriotism
but
the
barbaric
and
despotic
elements
retained
by
the
conquered
nations
as
yet
only
partially
assimilated
these
elements
became
germs
of
developments
rather
of
corruptions
and
prepared
the
downfall
of
the
empire
doubtless
these
corruptions
might
have
been
arrested
and
would
have
been
if
roman
patriotism
had
survived
the
changes
effected
in
the
roman
population
by
the
concession
of
roman
citizenship
to
provincials
but
it
did
not
and
they
were
favored
as
time
went
on
by
the
emperors
themselves
and
more
especially
by
dioclesian
a
real
barbarian
who
hated
rome
and
by
constantine
surnamed
the
great
a
real
despot
who
converted
the
empire
from
a
republican
to
a
despotic
empire
rome
fell
from
the
force
of
barbarism
developed
from
within
far
more
than
from
the
force
of
the
barbarians
hovering
on
her
frontiers
and
invading
her
provinces
the
law
of
all
possible
developments
is
in
the
providential
or
congenital
constitution
but
these
possible
developments
are
many
and
various
and
the
reason
and
of
the
nation
as
well
as
of
individuals
are
operative
in
determining
which
of
them
shall
be
adopted
the
nation
under
the
direction
of
wise
and
able
statesmen
who
understood
their
age
and
country
who
knew
how
to
discern
between
normal
developments
and
barbaric
corruptions
placed
at
the
head
of
affairs
in
season
might
have
saved
rome
from
her
fate
eliminated
the
barbaric
and
assimilated
the
foreign
elements
and
preserved
rome
as
a
christian
and
republican
empire
to
this
day
and
saved
the
civilized
world
from
the
ten
centuries
of
barbarism
which
followed
her
conquest
by
the
barbarians
of
the
north
but
it
rarely
happens
that
the
real
statesmen
of
a
nation
are
placed
at
the
head
of
affairs
rome
did
not
fall
in
consequence
of
the
strength
of
her
external
enemies
nor
through
the
corruption
of
private
morals
and
manners
which
was
never
greater
than
under
the
first
triumvirate
she
fell
from
the
want
of
true
statesmanship
in
her
public
men
and
patriotism
in
her
people
private
virtues
and
private
vices
are
of
the
last
consequence
to
individuals
both
here
and
hereafter
but
private
virtues
never
saved
private
vices
never
ruined
a
nation
edward
the
confessor
was
a
saint
and
yet
he
prepared
the
way
for
the
norman
conquest
of
england
and
france
owes
infinitely
less
to
louis
than
to
louis
richelieu
and
napoleon
who
though
no
saints
were
statesmen
what
is
specially
needed
in
statesmen
is
public
spirit
intelligence
foresight
broad
views
manly
feelings
wisdom
energy
resolution
and
when
statesmen
with
these
qualities
are
placed
at
the
head
of
affairs
the
state
if
not
already
lost
can
however
far
gone
it
may
be
be
recovered
restored
reinvigorated
advanced
and
private
vice
and
corruption
disappear
in
the
splendor
of
public
virtue
providence
is
always
present
in
the
affairs
of
nations
but
not
to
work
miracles
to
counteract
the
natural
effects
of
the
ignorance
ineptness
narrow
views
public
stupidity
and
imbecility
of
rulers
because
they
are
irreproachable
and
saintly
in
their
private
characters
and
relations
as
was
henry
vi
of
england
or
in
some
respects
louis
xvi
of
france
providence
is
god
intervening
through
the
laws
he
by
his
creative
act
gives
to
creatures
not
their
suspension
or
abrogation
it
was
the
corruption
of
the
statesmen
in
substituting
the
barbaric
element
for
the
proper
roman
to
which
no
one
contributed
more
than
constantine
the
first
christian
emperor
that
was
the
real
cause
of
the
downfall
of
rome
and
the
centuries
of
barbarism
that
followed
relieved
only
by
the
superhuman
zeal
and
charity
of
the
church
to
save
souls
and
restore
civilization
but
in
the
constitution
of
the
government
as
distinguished
from
the
state
the
nation
is
freer
and
more
truly
sovereign
the
constitution
of
the
state
is
that
which
gives
to
the
people
of
a
given
territory
political
existence
unity
and
individuality
and
renders
it
capable
of
political
action
it
creates
political
or
national
solidarity
in
imitation
of
the
solidarity
of
the
race
in
which
it
has
its
root
it
is
the
providential
charter
of
national
existence
and
that
which
gives
to
each
nation
its
peculiar
character
and
distinguishes
it
from
every
other
nation
the
constitution
of
government
is
the
constitution
by
the
sovereign
authority
of
the
nation
of
an
agency
or
ministry
for
the
management
of
its
affairs
and
the
letter
of
instructions
according
to
which
the
agent
or
minister
is
to
act
and
conduct
the
matters
intrusted
to
him
the
distinction
which
the
english
make
between
the
sovereign
and
the
ministry
is
analogous
to
that
between
the
state
and
the
government
only
they
understand
by
the
sovereign
the
king
or
queen
and
by
the
ministry
the
executive
excluding
or
not
decidedly
including
the
legislature
and
the
judiciary
the
sovereign
is
the
people
as
the
state
or
body
politic
and
as
the
king
holds
from
god
only
through
the
people
he
is
not
properly
sovereign
and
is
to
be
ranked
with
the
ministry
or
government
yet
when
the
state
delegates
the
full
or
chief
governing
power
to
the
king
and
makes
him
its
sole
or
principal
representative
he
may
with
sufficient
accuracy
for
ordinary
purposes
be
called
sovereign
then
understanding
by
the
ministry
or
government
the
legislative
and
judicial
as
well
as
the
executive
functions
whether
united
in
one
or
separated
into
distinct
and
mutually
independent
departments
the
english
distinction
will
express
accurately
enough
except
for
strictly
scientific
purposes
the
distinction
between
the
state
and
the
government
still
it
is
only
in
despotic
states
which
are
not
founded
on
right
but
force
that
the
king
can
say
moi
i
am
the
state
and
shakespeare
usage
of
calling
the
king
of
france
simply
france
and
the
king
of
england
simply
england
smacks
of
feudalism
under
which
monarchy
is
an
estate
property
not
a
public
trust
it
corresponds
to
the
scottish
usage
of
calling
the
proprietor
by
the
name
of
his
estate
it
is
never
to
be
forgotten
that
in
republican
states
the
king
has
only
a
delegated
sovereignty
that
the
people
as
well
as
god
are
above
him
he
holds
his
power
as
the
emperor
of
the
french
professes
to
hold
his
by
the
grace
of
god
and
the
national
will
the
only
title
by
which
a
king
or
emperor
can
legitimately
hold
power
the
king
or
emperor
not
being
the
state
and
the
government
whatever
its
form
or
constitution
being
a
creature
of
the
state
he
can
be
dethroned
and
the
whole
government
even
virtually
overthrown
without
dissolving
the
state
or
the
political
society
such
an
event
may
cause
much
evil
create
much
social
confusion
and
do
grave
injury
to
the
nation
but
the
political
society
may
survive
it
the
sovereign
remains
in
the
plenitude
of
his
rights
as
competent
to
restore
government
as
he
was
originally
to
institute
it
when
in
louis
philippe
was
dethroned
by
the
parisian
mob
and
fled
the
kingdom
there
was
in
france
no
legitimate
government
for
all
commissions
ran
in
the
name
but
the
organic
or
territorial
people
of
france
the
body
politic
remained
and
in
it
remained
the
sovereign
power
to
organize
and
appoint
a
new
government
when
on
the
of
december
the
president
by
a
coup
suppressed
the
legislative
assembly
and
the
constitutional
government
there
was
no
legitimate
government
standing
and
the
power
assumed
by
the
president
was
unquestionably
a
usurpation
but
the
nation
was
competent
to
condone
his
usurpation
and
legalize
his
power
and
by
a
plebiscitum
actually
did
so
the
wisdom
or
justice
of
the
coup
is
another
question
about
which
men
may
differ
but
when
the
french
nation
by
its
subsequent
act
had
condoned
it
and
formally
conferred
dictatorial
powers
on
the
the
principal
had
approved
the
act
of
his
agent
and
given
him
discretionary
powers
and
nothing
more
was
to
be
said
the
imperial
constitution
and
the
election
of
the
president
to
be
emperor
that
followed
on
december
were
strictly
legal
and
whatever
men
may
think
of
napoleon
it
must
be
conceded
that
there
is
no
legal
flaw
in
his
title
and
that
he
holds
his
power
by
a
title
as
high
and
as
perfect
as
there
is
for
any
prince
or
ruler
but
the
plebiscitum
can
not
be
legally
appealed
to
or
be
valid
when
and
where
there
is
a
legal
government
existing
and
in
the
full
exercise
of
its
constitutional
functions
as
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
a
case
growing
out
of
what
is
known
as
the
dorr
rebellion
in
rhode
island
a
suffrage
committee
having
no
political
authority
drew
up
and
presented
a
new
constitution
of
government
to
the
people
plead
a
plebiscitum
in
its
favor
and
claimed
the
officers
elected
under
it
as
the
legally
elected
officers
of
the
state
the
court
refused
to
recognize
the
plebiscitum
and
decided
that
it
knew
rhode
island
only
as
represented
through
the
government
which
had
never
ceased
to
exist
new
states
in
territories
have
been
organized
on
the
strength
of
a
plebiscitum
when
the
legal
territorial
government
was
in
force
and
were
admitted
as
states
into
the
union
which
though
irregular
and
dangerous
could
be
done
without
revolution
because
congress
that
admitted
them
is
the
power
to
grant
the
permission
to
organize
as
states
and
apply
for
admission
congress
is
competent
to
condone
an
offence
against
its
own
rights
the
real
danger
of
the
practice
is
that
it
tends
to
create
a
conviction
that
sovereignty
inheres
in
the
people
individually
or
as
population
not
as
the
body
politic
or
organic
people
attached
to
a
sovereign
domain
and
the
people
who
organize
under
a
plebiscitum
are
not
till
organized
and
admitted
into
the
union
an
organic
or
a
political
people
at
all
when
louis
napoleon
made
his
appeal
to
a
vote
of
the
french
people
he
made
an
appeal
to
a
people
existing
as
a
sovereign
people
and
a
sovereign
people
without
a
legal
government
in
his
case
the
plebiscitum
was
proper
and
sufficient
even
if
it
be
conceded
that
it
was
through
his
own
fault
that
france
at
the
moment
was
found
without
a
legal
government
when
a
thing
is
done
though
wrongly
done
you
can
not
act
as
if
it
were
not
done
but
must
accept
it
as
a
fact
and
act
accordingly
the
plebiscitum
which
is
simply
an
appeal
to
the
people
outside
of
government
is
not
valid
when
the
government
has
not
lapsed
either
by
its
usurpations
or
by
its
dissolution
nor
is
it
valid
either
in
the
case
of
a
province
or
of
a
population
that
has
no
organic
existence
as
an
independent
sovereign
state
the
plebiscitum
in
france
was
valid
but
in
the
grand
duchy
of
tuscany
the
duchies
of
modena
parma
and
lucca
and
in
the
kingdom
of
the
two
sicilies
it
was
not
valid
for
their
legal
governments
had
not
lapsed
nor
was
it
valid
in
the
aemilian
provinces
of
the
papal
states
because
they
were
not
a
nation
or
a
sovereign
people
but
only
a
portion
of
such
nation
or
people
in
the
case
of
the
states
and
provinces
except
lombardy
ceded
to
france
by
austria
and
sold
to
the
sardinian
king
annexed
to
piedmont
to
form
the
new
kingdom
of
italy
the
plebiscitum
was
invalid
because
implying
the
right
of
the
people
to
rebel
against
the
legal
authority
and
to
break
the
unity
and
individuality
of
the
state
of
which
they
form
an
integral
part
the
nation
is
a
whole
and
no
part
has
the
right
to
secede
or
separate
and
set
up
a
government
for
itself
or
annex
itself
to
another
state
without
the
consent
of
the
whole
the
solidarity
of
the
nation
is
both
a
fact
and
a
law
the
secessionists
from
the
united
states
defended
their
action
only
on
the
ground
that
the
states
of
the
american
union
are
severally
independent
sovereign
states
and
they
only
obeyed
the
authority
of
their
respective
states
the
plebiscitum
or
irregular
appeal
to
what
is
called
universal
suffrage
since
adopted
by
louis
napoleon
in
france
after
the
coup
is
becoming
not
a
little
menacing
to
the
stability
of
governments
and
the
rights
and
integrity
of
states
and
is
not
less
dangerous
to
the
peace
and
order
of
society
than
the
solidarity
of
peoples
asserted
by
kossuth
the
revolutionary
of
hungary
the
last
stronghold
of
feudal
barbarism
in
christian
europe
for
russia
has
emancipated
her
serfs
the
nation
as
sovereign
is
free
to
constitute
government
according
to
its
own
judgment
under

any
of
these
forms
and
systems
and
many
others
besides
are
or
may
be
legitimate
if
established
and
maintained
by
the
national
will
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
of
god
or
of
nature
antecedently
to
the
national
will
that
gives
any
one
of
them
a
right
to
the
exclusion
of
any
one
of
the
others
the
imperial
system
in
france
is
as
legitimate
as
the
federative
system
in
the
united
states
the
only
form
or
system
that
is
necessarily
illegal
is
the
despotic
that
can
never
be
a
truly
civilized
government
nor
a
legitimate
government
for
god
has
given
to
man
no
dominion
over
man
he
gave
men
as
augustine
says
and
pope
gregory
the
great
repeats
dominion
over
the
irrational
creation
not
over
the
rational
and
hence
the
primitive
rulers
of
men
were
called
pastors
or
shepherds
not
lords
it
may
be
the
duty
of
the
people
subjected
to
a
despotic
government
to
demean
themselves
quietly
and
peaceably
towards
it
as
a
matter
of
prudence
to
avoid
sedition
and
the
evils
that
would
necessarily
follow
an
attempted
revolution
but
not
because
founded
as
it
is
on
mere
force
it
has
itself
any
right
or
legality
all
other
forms
of
government
are
republican
in
their
essential
constitution
founded
on
public
right
and
held
under
god
from
and
for
the
commonwealth
and
which
of
them
is
wisest
and
best
for
the
commonwealth
is
for
the
most
part
an
idle
question
forms
of
government
somebody
has
said
are
like
shoes
that
is
the
best
form
which
best
fit
the
feet
that
are
to
wear
them
shoes
are
to
be
fitted
to
the
feet
not
the
feet
to
the
shoes
and
feet
vary
in
size
and
conformation
there
is
in
regard
to
government
as
distinguished
from
the
state
no
antecedent
right
which
binds
the
people
for
antecedently
to
the
existence
of
the
government
as
a
fact
the
state
is
free
to
adopt
any
form
that
it
finds
practicable
or
judges
the
wisest
and
best
for
itself
ordinarily
the
form
of
the
government
practicable
for
a
nation
is
determined
by
the
peculiar
providential
constitution
of
the
territorial
people
and
a
form
of
government
that
would
be
practicable
and
good
in
one
country
may
be
the
reverse
in
another
the
english
government
is
no
doubt
the
best
practicable
in
great
britain
at
present
at
least
but
it
has
proved
a
failure
wherever
else
it
has
been
attempted
the
american
system
has
proved
itself
in
spite
of
the
recent
formidable
rebellion
to
overthrow
it
the
best
and
only
practicable
government
for
the
united
states
but
it
is
impracticable
everywhere
else
and
all
attempts
by
any
european
or
other
american
state
to
introduce
it
can
end
only
in
disaster
the
imperial
system
apparently
works
well
in
france
but
though
all
european
states
are
tending
to
it
it
would
not
work
well
at
all
on
the
american
continent
certainly
not
until
the
republic
of
the
united
states
has
ceased
to
exist
while
the
united
states
remain
the
great
american
power
that
system
or
its
kindred
system
democratic
centralism
can
never
become
an
american
system
as
maximilian
experiment
in
mexico
is
likely
to
prove
political
propagandism
except
on
the
roman
plan
that
is
by
annexation
and
incorporation
is
as
impracticable
as
it
is
wanting
in
the
respect
that
one
independent
people
owes
to
another
the
old
french
jacobins
tried
to
propagate
even
with
fire
and
sword
their
system
throughout
europe
as
the
only
system
compatible
with
the
rights
of
man
the
english
since
have
been
great
political
propagandists
and
at
one
time
it
seemed
not
unlikely
that
every
european
state
would
try
the
experiment
of
a
parliamentary
government
composed
of
an
hereditary
crown
an
hereditary
house
of
lords
and
an
elective
house
of
commons
the
democratic
americans
are
also
great
political
propagandists
and
are
ready
to
sympathize
with
any
rebellion
insurrection
or
movement
in
behalf
of
democracy
in
any
part
of
the
world
however
mean
or
contemptible
fierce
or
bloody
it
may
be
but
all
this
is
as
unstatesmanlike
as
unjust
unstatesmanlike
for
no
form
of
government
can
bear
transplanting
and
because
every
independent
nation
is
the
sole
judge
of
what
best
comports
with
its
own
interests
and
its
judgment
is
to
be
respected
by
the
citizens
as
well
as
by
the
governments
of
other
states
religious
propagandism
is
a
right
and
a
duty
because
religion
is
catholic
and
of
universal
obligation
and
so
is
the
jus
gentium
of
the
romans
which
is
only
the
application
to
individuals
and
nations
of
the
great
principles
of
natural
justice
but
no
political
propagandism
is
ever
allowable
because
no
one
form
of
government
is
catholic
in
its
nature
or
of
universal
obligation
thoughtful
americans
are
opposed
to
political
propagandism
and
respect
the
right
of
every
nation
to
choose
its
own
form
of
government
but
they
hold
that
the
american
system
is
the
best
in
itself
and
that
if
other
nations
were
as
enlightened
as
the
american
they
would
adopt
it
but
though
the
american
system
rightly
understood
is
the
best
as
they
hold
it
is
not
because
other
nations
are
less
enlightened
which
is
by
no
means
a
fact
that
they
do
not
adopt
or
can
not
bear
it
but
solely
because
their
providential
constitutions
do
not
require
or
admit
it
and
an
attempt
to
introduce
it
in
any
of
them
would
prove
a
failure
and
a
grave
evil
fit
your
shoes
to
your
feet
the
law
of
the
governmental
constitution
is
in
that
of
the
nation
the
constitution
of
the
government
must
grow
out
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
accord
with
the
genius
the
character
the
habits
customs
and
wants
of
the
people
or
it
will
not
work
well
or
tend
to
secure
the
legitimate
ends
of
government
the
constitutions
imagined
by
philosophers
are
for
utopia
not
for
any
actual
living
breathing
people
you
must
take
the
state
as
it
is
and
develop
your
governmental
constitution
from
it
and
harmonize
it
with
it
where
there
is
a
discrepancy
between
the
two
constitutions
the
government
has
no
support
in
the
state
in
the
organic
people
or
nation
and
can
sustain
itself
only
by
corruption
or
physical
force
a
government
may
be
under
the
necessity
of
using
force
to
suppress
an
insurrection
or
rebellion
against
the
national
authority
or
the
integrity
of
the
national
territory
but
no
government
that
can
sustain
itself
not
the
state
only
by
physical
force
or
large
standing
armies
can
be
a
good
government
or
suited
to
the
nation
it
must
adopt
the
most
stringent
repressive
measures
suppress
liberty
of
speech
and
of
conscience
outrage
liberty
in
what
it
has
the
most
intimate
and
sacred
and
practise
the
most
revolting
violence
and
cruelty
for
it
can
govern
only
by
terror
such
a
government
is
unsuited
to
the
nation
this
is
seen
in
all
history
in
the
attempt
of
the
dictator
sulla
to
preserve
the
old
patrician
government
against
the
plebeian
power
that
time
and
events
had
developed
in
the
roman
state
and
which
was
about
to
gain
the
supremacy
as
we
have
seen
at
pharsalia
philippi
and
actium
in
the
efforts
to
establish
a
jacobinical
government
in
france
in
in
rome
in
and
the
government
of
victor
emmanuel
in
naples
in
and
these
efforts
proscriptions
confiscations
military
executions
assassinations
massacres
are
all
made
in
the
name
of
liberty
or
in
defence
of
a
government
supposed
to
guaranty
the
of
the
state
and
the
rights
of
the
people
they
are
rendered
inevitable
by
the
mad
attempt
to
force
on
a
nation
a
constitution
of
government
foreign
to
the
national
constitution
or
repugnant
to
the
national
tastes
interests
habits
convictions
or
whole
interior
life
the
repressive
policy
adopted
to
a
certain
extent
by
nearly
all
european
governments
grows
out
of
the
madness
of
a
portion
of
the
people
of
the
several
states
in
seeking
to
force
upon
the
nation
an
constitution
the
sovereigns
may
not
be
very
wise
but
they
are
wiser
more
national
more
patriotic
than
the
mad
theorists
who
seek
to
revolutionize
the
state
and
establish
a
government
that
has
no
hold
in
the
national
traditions
the
national
character
or
the
national
life
and
the
statesman
the
patriot
the
true
friend
of
liberty
sympathizes
with
the
national
authorities
not
with
the
mad
theorists
and
revolutionists
the
right
of
a
nation
to
change
its
form
of
government
and
its
magistrates
or
representatives
by
whatever
name
called
is
incontestable
hence
the
french
constitution
of
which
involved
that
of
was
not
illegal
for
though
accompanied
by
some
irregularities
it
was
adopted
by
the
manifest
will
of
the
nation
and
consented
to
by
all
orders
in
the
state
not
its
legality
but
its
wisdom
is
to
be
questioned
together
with
the
false
and
dangerous
theories
of
government
which
dictated
it
there
is
no
compact
or
mutual
stipulation
between
the
state
and
the
government
the
state
under
god
is
sovereign
and
ordains
and
establishes
the
government
instead
of
making
a
contract
a
bargain
or
covenant
with
it
the
common
democratic
doctrine
on
this
point
is
right
if
by
people
is
understood
the
organic
people
attached
to
a
sovereign
domain
not
the
people
as
individuals
or
as
a
floating
or
nomadic
multitude
by
people
in
the
political
sense
cicero
and
augustine
after
him
understood
the
people
as
the
republic
organized
in
reference
to
the
common
or
public
good
with
this
understanding
the
sovereignty
persists
in
the
people
and
they
retain
the
supreme
authority
over
the
government
the
powers
delegated
are
still
the
powers
of
the
sovereign
delegating
them
and
may
be
modified
altered
or
revoked
as
the
sovereign
judges
proper
the
nation
does
not
and
can
not
abdicate
or
delegate
away
its
own
sovereignty
for
sovereign
it
is
and
can
not
but
be
so
long
as
it
remains
a
nation
not
subjected
to
another
nation
by
the
imperial
constitution
of
the
french
government
the
imperial
power
is
vested
in
napoleon
and
made
hereditary
in
his
family
in
the
male
line
of
his
legitimate
descendants
this
is
legal
but
the
nation
has
not
parted
with
its
sovereignty
or
bound
itself
by
contract
forever
to
a
napoleonic
dynasty
napoleon
holds
the
imperial
power
by
the
grace
of
god
and
the
will
of
the
nation
which
means
simply
that
he
holds
his
authority
from
god
through
the
french
people
and
is
bound
to
exercise
it
according
to
the
law
of
god
and
the
national
will
the
nation
is
as
competent
to
revoke
this
constitution
as
the
legislature
is
to
repeal
any
law
it
is
competent
to
enact
and
in
doing
so
breaks
no
contract
violates
no
right
for
napoleon
and
his
descendants
hold
their
right
to
the
imperial
throne
subject
to
the
national
will
from
which
it
is
derived
in
case
the
nation
should
revoke
the
powers
delegated
he
or
they
would
have
no
more
valid
claim
to
the
throne
than
have
the
bourbons
whom
the
nation
has
unmistakably
dismissed
from
its
service
the
only
point
here
to
be
observed
is
that
the
change
must
be
by
the
nation
itself
in
its
sovereign
capacity
not
by
a
mob
nor
by
a
part
of
the
nation
conspiring
intriguing
or
rebelling
without
any
commission
from
the
nation
the
first
napoleon
governed
by
a
legal
title
but
he
was
never
legally
dethroned
and
the
government
of
the
bourbons
whether
of
the
elder
branch
or
the
younger
was
never
a
legal
government
for
the
bourbons
had
lost
their
original
rights
by
the
election
of
the
first
napoleon
and
never
afterwards
had
the
national
will
in
their
favor
the
republic
of
was
legal
in
the
sense
that
the
nation
acquiesced
in
it
as
a
temporary
necessity
but
hardly
anybody
believed
in
it
or
wanted
it
and
the
nation
accepted
it
as
a
sort
of
locum
tenens
rather
than
willed
or
ordained
it
its
overthrow
by
the
coup
may
not
be
legally
defensible
but
the
election
of
napoleon
iii
condoned
the
illegality
if
there
was
any
and
gave
the
emperor
a
legal
title
that
no
republican
that
none
but
a
despot
or
a
man
can
dispute
as
the
will
of
the
nation
in
so
far
as
it
contravenes
not
the
law
of
god
or
the
law
of
nature
binds
every
individual
of
the
nation
no
individual
or
number
of
individuals
has
or
can
have
any
right
to
conspire
against
him
or
to
labor
to
oust
him
from
his
place
till
his
escheat
has
been
pronounced
by
the
voice
of
the
nation
the
state
in
its
sovereign
capacity
willing
it
is
the
only
power
competent
to
revoke
or
to
change
the
form
and
constitution
of
the
imperial
government
the
same
must
be
said
of
every
nation
that
has
a
lawful
government
and
this
while
it
preserves
the
national
sovereignty
secures
freedom
of
progress
condemns
all
sedition
conspiracy
rebellion
revolution
as
does
the
christian
law
itself
chapter
ix
the
united
states
sovereignty
under
god
inheres
in
the
organic
people
or
the
people
as
the
republic
and
every
organic
people
fixed
to
the
soil
and
politically
independent
of
every
other
people
is
a
sovereign
people
and
in
the
modern
sense
an
independent
sovereign
nation
sovereign
states
may
unite
in
an
alliance
league
or
confederation
and
mutually
agree
to
exercise
their
sovereign
powers
or
a
portion
of
them
in
common
through
a
common
organ
or
agency
but
in
this
agreement
they
part
with
none
of
their
sovereignty
and
each
remains
a
sovereign
state
or
nation
as
before
the
common
organ
or
agency
created
by
the
convention
is
no
state
is
no
nation
has
no
inherent
sovereignty
and
derives
all
its
vitality
and
force
from
the
persisting
sovereignty
of
the
states
severally
that
have
united
in
creating
it
the
agreement
no
more
affects
the
sovereignty
of
the
several
states
entering
into
it
than
does
the
appointment
of
an
agent
affect
the
rights
and
powers
of
the
principal
the
creature
takes
nothing
from
the
creator
exhausts
not
lessens
not
his
creative
energy
and
it
is
only
by
his
retaining
and
continuously
exerting
his
creative
power
that
the
creature
continues
to
exist
an
independent
state
or
nation
may
with
or
without
its
consent
lose
its
sovereignty
but
only
by
being
merged
in
or
subjected
to
another
independent
sovereign
states
can
not
by
convention
or
mutual
agreement
form
themselves
into
a
single
sovereign
state
or
nation
the
compact
or
agreement
is
made
by
sovereign
states
and
binds
by
virtue
of
the
sovereign
power
of
each
of
the
contracting
parties
to
destroy
that
sovereign
power
would
be
to
annul
the
compact
and
render
void
the
agreement
the
agreement
can
be
valid
and
binding
only
on
condition
that
each
of
the
contracting
parties
retains
the
sovereignty
that
rendered
it
competent
to
enter
into
the
compact
and
states
that
retain
severally
their
sovereignty
do
not
form
a
single
sovereign
state
or
nation
the
states
in
convention
can
not
become
a
new
and
single
sovereign
state
unless
they
lose
their
several
sovereignty
and
merge
it
in
the
new
sovereignty
but
this
they
can
not
do
by
agreement
because
the
moment
the
parties
to
the
agreement
cease
to
be
sovereign
the
agreement
on
which
alone
depends
the
new
sovereign
state
is
vacated
in
like
manner
as
a
contract
is
vacated
by
the
death
of
the
contracting
parties
that
a
nation
may
voluntarily
cede
its
sovereignty
is
frankly
admitted
but
it
can
cede
it
only
to
something
or
somebody
actually
existing
for
to
cede
to
nothing
and
not
to
cede
is
one
and
the
same
thing
they
can
part
with
their
own
sovereignty
by
merging
themselves
in
another
national
existence
but
not
by
merging
themselves
in
nothing
and
till
they
have
parted
with
their
own
sovereignty
the
new
sovereign
state
does
not
exist
a
prince
can
abdicate
his
power
because
by
abdicating
he
simply
gives
back
to
the
people
the
trust
he
had
received
from
them
but
a
nation
can
not
save
by
merging
itself
in
another
an
independent
state
not
merged
in
another
or
that
is
not
subject
to
another
can
not
cease
to
be
a
sovereign
nation
even
if
it
would
that
no
sovereign
state
can
be
formed
by
agreement
or
compact
has
already
been
shown
in
the
refutation
of
the
theory
of
the
origin
of
government
in
convention
or
the
social
compact
sovereign
states
are
as
unable
to
form
themselves
into
a
single
sovereign
state
by
mutual
compact
as
are
the
sovereign
individuals
imagined
by
rousseau
the
convention
either
of
sovereign
states
or
of
sovereign
individuals
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
can
form
only
a
compact
or
agreement
between
sovereigns
and
an
agreement
or
compact
whatever
its
terms
or
conditions
is
only
an
alliance
a
league
or
a
confederation
which
no
one
can
pretend
is
a
sovereign
state
nation
or
republic
the
question
then
whether
the
united
states
are
a
single
sovereign
state
or
nation
or
a
confederacy
of
independent
sovereign
states
depends
on
the
question
whether
the
american
people
originally
existed
as
one
people
or
as
several
independent
states
jefferson
maintains
that
before
the
convention
of
they
existed
as
several
independent
sovereign
states
but
that
since
that
convention
or
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
it
proposed
they
exist
as
one
political
people
in
regard
to
foreign
nations
and
several
sovereign
states
in
regard
to
their
internal
and
domestic
relations
webster
concedes
that
originally
the
states
existed
as
severally
sovereign
states
but
contends
that
by
ratifying
the
constitution
they
have
been
made
one
sovereign
political
people
state
or
nation
and
that
the
general
government
is
a
supreme
national
government
though
with
a
reservation
in
favor
of
state
rights
but
both
are
wrong
if
the
several
states
of
the
union
were
severally
sovereign
states
when
they
met
in
the
convention
they
are
so
now
and
the
constitution
is
only
an
agreement
or
compact
between
sovereigns
and
the
united
states
are
as
calhoun
maintained
only
a
confederation
of
sovereign
states
and
not
a
single
state
or
one
political
community
but
if
the
sovereignty
persists
in
the
states
severally
any
state
saving
its
faith
may
whenever
it
chooses
to
do
so
withdraw
from
the
union
absolve
its
subjects
from
all
obligation
to
the
federal
authorities
and
make
it
treason
in
them
to
adhere
to
the
federal
government
secession
is
then
an
incontestable
right
not
a
right
held
under
the
constitution
or
derived
from
the
convention
but
a
right
held
prior
to
it
independently
of
it
inherent
in
the
state
sovereignty
and
inseparable
from
it
the
state
is
bound
by
the
constitution
of
the
union
only
while
she
is
in
it
and
is
one
of
the
states
united
in
ratifying
the
constitution
she
did
not
part
with
her
sovereignty
or
with
any
portion
of
it
any
more
than
france
has
parted
with
her
sovereignty
and
ceased
to
be
an
independent
sovereign
nation
by
vesting
the
imperial
power
in
napoleon
iii
and
his
legitimate
heirs
male
the
principal
parts
not
with
his
power
to
his
agent
for
the
agent

an
agent
only
by
virtue
of
the
continued
power
of
the
principal
napoleon
is
emperor
by
the
will
of
the
french
people
and
governs
only
by
the
authority
of
the
french
nation
which
is
as
competent
to
revoke
the
powers
it
has
conferred
on
him
when
it
judges
proper
as
it
was
to
confer
them
the
union
exists
and
governs
if
the
states
are
sovereign
only
by
the
will
of
the
state
and
she
is
as
competent
to
revoke
the
powers
she
has
delegated
as
she
was
to
delegate
them
the
union
as
far
as
she
is
concerned

her
creation
and
what
she
is
competent
to
make
she
is
competent
to
unmake
in
seceding
or
withdrawing
from
the
union
a
state
may
act
very
unwisely
very
much
against
her
own
interests
and
the
interests
of
the
other
members
of
the
confederacy
but
if
sovereign
she
in
doing
so
only
exercises
her
unquestionable
right
the
other
members
may
regret
her
action
both
for
her
sake
and
their
own
but
they
can
not
accuse
her
or
her
citizens
of
disloyalty
in
seceding
nor
of
rebellion
if
in
obedience
to
her
authority
they
defend
their
independence
by
force
of
arms
against
the
union
neither
she
nor
they
on
the
supposition
ever
owed
allegiance
to
the
union
allegiance
is
due
from
the
citizen
to
the
sovereign
state
but
never
from
a
sovereign
state
or
from
its
citizens
to
any
other
sovereign
state
while
the
state
is
in
the
union
the
citizen
owes
obedience
to
the
united
states
but
only
because
his
state
has
in
ratifying
the
federal
constitution
enacted
that
it
and
all
laws
and
treaties
made
under
it
shall
be
law
within
her
territory
the
repeal
by
the
state
of
the
act
of
ratification
releases
the
citizen
from
the
obligation
even
of
obedience
and
renders
it
criminal
for
him
to
yield
it
without
her
permission
it
avails
nothing
on
the
hypothesis
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
as
distinguished
from
that
of
the
united
states
to
appeal
to
the
language
or
provisions
of
the
federal
constitution
that
constitutes
the
government
not
the
state
or
the
sovereign
it
is
ordained
by
the
sovereign
and
if
the
states
were
severally
independent
and
sovereign
states
that
sovereign
is
the
states
severally
not
the
states
united
the
constitution
is
law
for
the
citizens
of
a
state
only
so
long
as
the
state
remains
one
of
the
united
states
no
matter
then
how
clear
and
express
the
language
or
stringent
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
they
bind
only
the
citizens
of
the
states
that
enact
the
constitution
the
written
constitution
is
simply
a
compact
and
obliges
only
while
the
compact
is
continued
by
the
states
each
for
itself
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
as
a
single
or
political
people
must
be
established
before
any
thing
in
the
constitution
can
be
adduced
as
denying
the
right
of
secession
that
this
doctrine
would
deprive
the
general
government
of
all
right
to
enforce
the
laws
of
the
union
on
a
state
that
secedes
or
the
citizens
thereof
is
no
doubt
true
that
it
would
weaken
the
central
power
and
make
the
union
a
simple
voluntary
association
of
states
no
better
than
a
rope
of
sand
is
no
less
true
but
what
then
it
is
simply
saying
that
a
confederation
is
inferior
to
a
nation
and
that
a
federal
government
lacks
many
of
the
advantages
of
a
national
government
confederacies
are
always
weak
in
the
centre
always
lack
unity
and
are
liable
to
be
dissolved
by
the
influence
of
local
passions
prejudices
and
interests
but
if
the
united
states
are
a
confederation
of
states
or
nations
not
a
single
nation
or
sovereign
state
then
there
is
no
remedy
if
the
colonies
when
their
independence
of
great
britain
was
achieved
and
acknowledged
were
severally
sovereign
states
it
has
never
since
been
in
their
power
to
unite
and
form
a
single
sovereign
state
or
to
form
themselves
into
one
indivisible
sovereign
nation
they
could
unite
only
by
mutual
agreement
which
gives
only
a
confederation
in
which
each
retains
its
own
sovereignty
as
two
individuals
however
closely
united
retain
each
his
own
individuality
no
sovereignty
is
of
conventional
origin
and
none
can
emerge
from
the
convention
that
did
not
enter
it
either
the
states
are
one
sovereign
people
or
they
are
not
if
they
are
not
it
is
undoubtedly
a
great
disadvantage
but
a
disadvantage
that
must
be
accepted
and
submitted
to
without
a
murmur
whether
the
united
states
are
one
sovereign
people
or
only
a
confederation
is
a
question
of
very
grave
importance
if
they
are
only
a
confederation
of
states
and
if
they
ever
were
severally
sovereign
states
only
a
confederation
they
certainly
are
state
secession
is
an
inalienable
right
and
the
government
has
had
no
right
to
make
war
on
the
secessionists
as
rebels
or
to
treat
them
when
their
military
power
is
broken
as
traitors
or
disloyal
persons
the
honor
of
the
government
and
of
the
people
who
have
sustained
it
is
then
deeply
compromised
what
then
is
the
fact
are
the
united
states
politically
one
people
nation
state
or
republic
or
are
they
simply
independent
sovereign
states
united
in
close
and
intimate
alliance
league
or
federation
by
a
mutual
pact
or
agreement
were
the
people
of
the
united
states
who
ordained
and
established
the
written
constitution
one
people
or
were
they
not
if
they
were
not
before
ordaining
and
establishing
the
government
they
are
not
now
for
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
did
not
and
could
not
make
them
one
whether
they
are
one
or
many
is
then
simply
a
question
of
fact
to
be
decided
by
the
facts
in
the
case
not
by
the
theories
of
american
statesmen
the
opinion
of
jurists
or
even
by
constitutional
law
itself
the
old
articles
of
confederation
and
the
later
constitution
can
serve
here
only
as
historical
documents
constitutions
and
laws
presuppose
the
existence
of
a
national
sovereign
from
which
they
emanate
and
that
ordains
them
for
they
are
the
formal
expression
of
a
sovereign
will
the
nation
must
exist
as
an
historical
fact
prior
to
the
possession
or
exercise
of
sovereign
power
prior
to
the
existence
of
written
constitutions
and
laws
of
any
kind
and
its
existence
must
be
established
before
they
can
be
recognized
as
having
any
legal
force
or
vitality
the
existence
of
any
nation
as
an
independent
sovereign
nation
is
a
purely
historical
fact
for
its
right
to
exist
as
such
is
in
the
simple
fact
that
it
does
so
exist
a
nation
de
facto
is
a
nation
de
jure
and
when
we
have
ascertained
the
fact
we
have
ascertained
the
right
there
is
no
right
in
the
case
separate
from
the
fact
only
the
fact
must
be
really
a
fact
a
people
hitherto
a
part
of
another
people
or
subject
to
another
sovereign
is
not
in
fact
a
nation
because
they
have
declared
themselves
independent
and
have
organized
a
government
and
are
engaged
in
what
promises
to
be
a
successful
struggle
for
independence
the
struggle
must
be
practically
over
the
former
sovereign
must
have
practically
abandoned
the
effort
to
reduce
them
to
submission
or
to
bring
them
back
under
his
authority
and
if
he
continues
it
does
it
as
a
matter
of
mere
form
the
postulant
must
have
proved
his
ability
to
maintain
civil
government
and
to
fulfil
within
and
without
the
obligations
which
attach
to
every
civilized
nation
before
it
can
be
recognized
as
an
independent
sovereign
nation
because
before
it
is
not
a
fact
that
it
is
a
sovereign
nation
the
prior
sovereign
when
no
longer
willing
or
able
to
vindicate
his
right
has
lost
it
and
no
one
is
any
longer
bound
to
respect
it
for
humanity
demands
not
martyrs
to
lost
causes
this
doctrine
may
seem
harsh
and
untenable
even
to
those
sickly
philanthropists
who
are
always
weeping
over
extinct
or
oppressed
nationalities
but
nationality
in
modern
civilization
is
a
fact
not
a
right
antecedent
to
the
fact
the
repugnance
felt
to
this
assertion
arises
chiefly
from
using
the
word
nation
sometimes
in
a
strictly
political
sense
and
sometimes
in
its
original
sense
of
tribe
and
understanding
by
it
not
simply
the
body
politic
but
a
certain
relation
of
origin
family
kindred
blood
or
race
but
god
has
made
of
one
blood
or
race
all
the
nations
of
men
and
besides
no
political
rights
are
founded
by
the
law
of
nature
on
relations
of
blood
kindred
or
family
under
the
patriarchal
or
tribal
system
and
to
some
extent
under
feudalism
these
relations
form
the
basis
of
government
but
they
are
economical
relations
rather
than
civil
or
political
and
under
christian
and
modern
civilization
are
restricted
to
the
household
are
domestic
relations
and
enter
not
the
state
or
body
politic
except
by
way
of
reminiscence
or
abuse
they
are
protected
by
the
state
but
do
not
found
or
constitute
it
the
vicissitudes
of
time
the
revolutions
of
states
and
empires
migration
conquest
and
intermixture
of
families
and
races
have
rendered
it
impracticable
even
if
it
were
desirable
to
distribute
people
into
nations
according
to
their
relations
of
blood
or
descent
there
is
no
civilized
nation
now
existing
that
has
been
developed
from
a
common
ancestor
this
side
of
adam
and
the
most
mixed
are
the
most
civilized
the
nearer
a
nation
approaches
to
a
primitive
people
of
pure
unmixed
blood
the
farther
removed
it
is
from
civilization
all
civilized
nations
are
political
nations
and
are
founded
in
the
fact
not
on
rights
antecedent
to
the
fact
a
hundred
or
more
lost
nationalities
went
to
form
the
roman
empire
and
who
can
tell
us
how
many
layers
of
crushed
nationalities
superposed
one
upon
another
serve
for
the
foundation
of
the
present
french
english
russian
austrian
or
spanish
nationalities
what
other
title
to
independence
and
sovereignty
than
the
fact
can
you
plead
in
behalf
of
any
european
nation
every
one
has
absorbed
and
extinguished
no
one
can
say
how
many
nationalities
that
once
had
as
good
a
right
to
be
as
it
has
or
can
have
whether
those
nationalities
have
been
justly
extinguished
or
not
is
no
question
for
the
statesman
it
is
the
secret
of
providence
failure
in
this
world
is
not
always
a
proof
of
wrong
nor
success
of
right
the
good
is
sometimes
overborne
and
the
bad
sometimes
triumphs
but
it
is
consoling
and
even
just
to
believe
that
the
good
oftener
triumphs
than
the
bad
in
the
political
order
the
fact
under
god
precedes
the
law
the
nation
holds
not
from
the
law
but
the
law
holds
from
the
nation
doubtless
the
courts
of
every
civilized
nation
recognize
and
apply
both
the
law
of
nature
and
the
law
of
nations
but
only
on
the
ground
that
they
are
included
or
are
presumed
to
be
included
in
the
national
law
or
jurisprudence
doubtless
too
the
nation
holds
from
god
under
the
law
of
nature
but
only
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
nation
and
when
it
is
a
nation
dependent
on
no
other
it
holds
from
god
all
the
rights
and
powers
of
any
independent
sovereign
nation
there
is
no
right
behind
the
fact
needed
to
legalize
the
fact
or
to
put
the
nation
that
is
in
fact
a
nation
in
possession
of
full
national
rights
in
the
case
of
a
new
nation
or
people
lately
an
integral
part
of
another
people
or
subject
to
another
people
the
right
of
the
prior
sovereign
must
be
extinguished
indeed
but
the
extinction
of
that
right
is
necessary
to
complete
the
fact
which
otherwise
would
be
only
an
initial
inchoate
fact
not
a
fait
accompli
but
that
right
ceases
when
its
claimant
willingly
or
unwillingly
formally
or
virtually
abandons
it
and
he
does
so
when
he
practically
abandons
the
struggle
and
shows
no
ability
or
intention
of
soon
renewing
it
with
any
reasonable
prospect
of
success
the
notion
of
right
independent
of
the
fact
as
applied
to
sovereignty
is
founded
in
error
empty
titles
to
states
and
kingdoms
are
of
no
validity
the
sovereignty
is
under
god
in
the
nation
and
the
title
and
the
possession
are
inseparable
the
title
of
the
palaeologi
to
the
roman
empire
of
the
east
of
the
king
of
sicily
the
king
of
sardinia
or
the
king
of
spain
for
they
are
all
claimants
to
the
kingdom
of
jerusalem
founded
by
godfrey
and
his
crusaders
of
the
stuarts
to
the
thrones
of
england
ireland
and
scotland
or
of
the
bourbons
to
the
throne
of
france
are
vacated
and
not
worth
the
parchment
on
which
they
are
engrossed
the
contrary
opinion
so
generally
entertained
belongs
to
barbarism
not
to
civilization
it
is
in
modern
society
a
relic
of
feudalism
which
places
the
state
in
the
government
and
makes
the
government
a
private
estate
a
private
and
not
a
public
right
a
right
to
govern
the
public
not
a
right
to
govern
held
from
or
by
the
public
the
proprietor
may
be
dispossessed
in
fact
of
his
estate
by
violence
by
illegal
or
unjust
means
without
losing
his
right
and
another
may
usurp
it
occupy
it
and
possess
it
in
fact
without
acquiring
any
right
or
legal
title
to
it
the
man
who
holds
the
legal
title
has
the
right
to
oust
him
and
upon
his
estate
whenever
able
to
do
so
here
in
the
economical
order
the
fact
and
the
right
are
distinguishable
and
the
actual
occupant
may
be
required
to
show
his
holding
sovereignty
to
be
a
private
estate
the
feudal
lawyers
very
properly
distinguish
between
governments
de
facto
and
governments
de
jure
and
argue
very
logically
that
violent
dispossession
of
a
prince
does
not
invalidate
his
title
but
sovereignty
it
has
been
shown
is
not
in
the
government
but
in
the
state
and
the
state
is
inseparable
from
the
public
domain
the
people
organized
and
held
by
the
domain
or
national
territory
are
under
god
the
sovereign
nation
and
remain
so
as
long
as
the
nation
subsists
without
subjection
to
another
the
government
as
distinguished
from
the
state
or
nation
has
only
a
delegated
authority
governs
only
by
a
commission
from
the
nation
the
revocation
of
the
commission
vacates
its
title
and
extinguishes
its
rights
the
nation
is
always
sovereign
and
every
organic
people
fixed
to
the
soil
and
actually
independent
of
every
other
is
a
nation
there
can
then
be
no
independent
nation
de
facto
that
is
not
an
independent
nation
de
jure
nor
de
jure
that
is
not
de
facto
the
moment
a
people
cease
to
be
an
independent
nation
in
fact
they
cease
to
be
sovereign
and
the
moment
they
become
in
fact
an
independent
nation
they
are
so
of
right
hence
in
the
political
order
the
fact
and
the
right
are
born
and
expire
together
and
when
it
is
proved
that
a
people
are
in
fact
an
independent
nation
there
is
no
question
to
be
asked
as
to
their
right
to
be
such
nation
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
there
is
only
the
question
of
fact
if
they
are
in
fact
one
people
they
are
so
in
right
whatever
the
opinions
and
theories
of
statesmen
or
even
the
decisions
of
courts
for
the
courts
hold
from
the
national
authority
and
the
theories
and
opinions
of
statesmen
may
be
erroneous
certain
it
is
that
the
states
in
the
american
union
have
never
existed
and
acted
as
severally
sovereign
states
prior
to
independence
they
were
colonies
under
the
sovereignty
of
great
britain
and
since
independence
they
have
existed
and
acted
only
as
states
united
the
colonists
before
separation
and
independence
were
british
subjects
and
whatever
rights
the
colonies
had
they
held
by
charter
or
concession
from
the
british
crown
the
colonists
never
pretended
to
be
other
than
british
subjects
and
the
alleged
ground
of
their
complaint
against
the
mother
country
was
not
that
she
had
violated
their
natural
rights
as
men
but
their
rights
as
british
subjects
rights
as
contended
by
the
colonists
secured
by
the
english
constitution
to
all
englishmen
or
british
subjects
the
denial
to
them
of
these
common
rights
of
englishmen
they
called
tyranny
and
they
defended
themselves
in
throwing
off
their
allegiance
to
george
on
the
ground
that
he
had
in
their
regard
become
a
tyrant
and
the
tyranny
of
the
prince
absolves
the
subject
from
his
allegiance
in
the
declaration
of
independence
they
declared
themselves
independent
states
indeed
but
not
severally
independent
the
declaration
was
not
made
by
the
states
severally
but
by
the
states
jointly
as
the
united
states
they
unitedly
declared
their
independence
they
carried
on
the
war
for
independence
won
it
and
were
acknowledged
by
foreign
powers
and
by
the
mother
country
as
the
united
states
not
as
severally
independent
sovereign
states
severally
they
have
never
exercised
the
full
powers
of
sovereign
states
they
have
had
no
flag
symbol
of
sovereignty
recognized
by
foreign
powers
have
made
no
foreign
treaties
held
no
foreign
relations
had
no
commerce
foreign
or
interstate
coined
no
money
entered
into
no
alliances
or
confederacies
with
foreign
states
or
with
one
another
and
in
several
respects
have
been
more
restricted
in
their
powers
in
the
union
than
they
were
as
british
colonies
colonies
are
initial
or
inchoate
states
and
become
complete
states
by
declaring
and
winning
their
independence
and
if
the
english
colonies
now
the
united
states
had
separately
declared
and
won
their
independence
they
would
unquestionably
have
become
separately
independent
states
each
invested
by
the
law
of
nature
with
all
the
rights
and
powers
of
a
sovereign
nation
but
they
did
not
do
this
they
declared
and
won
their
independence
jointly
and
have
since
existed
and
exercised
sovereignty
only
as
states
united
or
the
united
states
that
is
states
sovereign
in
their
union
but
not
in
their
separation
this
is
of
itself
decisive
of
the
whole
question
but
the
colonists
have
not
only
never
exercised
the
full
powers
of
sovereignty
save
as
citizens
of
states
united
therefore
as
one
people
but
they
were
so
far
as
a
people
at
all
one
people
even
before
independence
the
colonies
were
all
erected
and
endowed
with
their
rights
and
powers
by
one
and
the
same
national
authority
and
the
colonists
were
subjects
of
one
and
the
same
national
sovereign
quincy
adams
who
almost
alone
among
our
prominent
statesmen
maintains
the
unity
of
the
colonial
people
adds
indeed
to
their
subjection
to
the
same
sovereign
authority
community
of
origin
of
language
manners
customs
and
law
all
these
except
the
last
or
common
law
may
exist
without
national
unity
in
the
modern
political
sense
of
the
term
nation
the
english
common
law
was
recognized
by
the
colonial
courts
and
in
force
in
all
the
colonies
not
by
virtue
of
colonial
legislation
but
by
virtue
of
english
authority
as
expressed
in
english
jurisprudence
the
colonists
were
under
the
common
law
because
they
were
englishmen
and
subjects
of
the
english
sovereign
this
proves
that
they
were
really
one
people
with
the
english
people
though
existing
in
a
state
of
colonial
dependence
and
not
a
separate
people
having
nothing
politically
in
common
with
them
but
in
the
accident
of
having
the
same
royal
person
for
their
king
the
union
with
the
mother
country
was
national
not
personal
as
was
the
union
existing
between
england
and
hanover
or
that
still
existing
between
the
empire
of
austria
formerly
germany
and
the
kingdom
of
hungary
and
hence
the
british
parliament
claimed
and
not
illegally
the
right
to
tax
the
colonies
for
the
support
of
the
empire
and
to
bind
them
in
all
cases
whatsoever
a
claim
the
colonies
themselves
admitted
in
principle
by
recognizing
and
observing
the
british
navigation
laws
the
people
of
the
several
colonies
being
really
one
people
before
independence
in
the
sovereignty
of
the
mother
country
must
be
so
still
unless
they
have
since
by
some
valid
act
divided
themselves
or
been
divided
into
separate
and
independent
states
the
king
say
the
jurists
never
dies
and
the
heralds
cry
the
king
is
dead
live
the
king
sovereignty
never
lapses
is
never
in
abeyance
and
the
moment
it
ceases
in
one
people
it
is
renewed
in
another
the
british
sovereignty
ceased
in
the
colonies
with
independence
and
the
american
took
its
place
did
the
sovereignty
which
before
independence
was
in
great
britain
pass
from
great
britain
to
the
states
severally
or
to
the
states
united
it
might
have
passed
to
them
severally
but
did
it
there
is
no
question
of
law
or
antecedent
right
in
the
case
but
a
simple
question
of
fact
and
the
fact
is
determined
by
determining
who
it
was
that
assumed
it
exercised
it
and
has
continued
to
exercise
it
as
to
this
there
is
no
doubt
the
sovereignty
as
a
fact
has
been
assumed
and
exercised
by
the
united
states
the
states
united
and
never
by
the
states
separately
or
severally
then
as
a
fact
the
sovereignty
that
before
independence
was
in
great
britain
passed
on
independence
to
the
states
united
and
reappears
in
all
its
vigor
in
the
united
states
the
only
successor
to
great
britain
known
to
or
recognized
by
the
civilized
world
as
the
colonial
people
were
though
distributed
in
distinct
colonies
still
one
people
the
people
of
the
united
states
though
distributed
into
distinct
and
mutually
independent
states
are
yet
one
sovereign
people
therefore
a
sovereign
state
or
nation
and
not
a
simple
league
or
confederacy
of
nations
there
is
no
doubt
that
all
the
powers
exercised
by
the
general
government
though
embracing
all
foreign
relations
and
all
general
interests
and
relations
of
all
the
states
might
have
been
exercised
by
it
under
the
authority
of
a
mutual
compact
of
the
several
states
and
practically
the
difference
between
the
compact
theory
and
the
national
view
would
be
very
little
unless
in
cases
like
that
of
secession
on
the
supposition
that
the
american
people
are
one
political
people
the
government
would
have
the
right
to
treat
secession
in
the
sense
in
which
the
seceders
understand
it
as
rebellion
and
to
suppress
it
by
employing
all
the
physical
force
at
its
command
but
on
the
compact
theory
it
would
have
no
such
right
but
the
question
now
under
discussion
turns
simply
on
what
has
been
and
is
the
historical
fact
before
the
states
could
enter
into
the
compact
and
delegate
sovereign
powers
to
the
union
they
must
have
severally
possessed
them
it
is
historically
certain
that
they
did
not
possess
them
before
independence
they
did
not
obtain
them
by
independence
for
they
did
not
severally
succeed
to
the
british
sovereignty
to
which
they
succeeded
only
as
states
united
when
then
and
by
what
means
did
they
or
could
they
become
severally
sovereign
states
the
united
states
having
succeeded
to
the
british
sovereignty
in
the
colonies
they
came
into
possession
of
full
national
sovereignty
and
have
alone
held
and
exercised
it
ever
since
independence
became
a
fact
the
states
severally
succeeding
only
to
the
colonies
never
held
and
have
never
been
competent
to
delegate
sovereign
powers
the
old
articles
of
confederation
it
is
conceded
were
framed
on
the
assumption
that
the
states
are
severally
sovereign
but
the
several
states
at
the
same
time
were
regarded
as
forming
one
nation
and
though
divided
into
separate
states
the
people
were
regarded
as
one
people
the
legislature
of
new
york
as
early
as
calls
for
an
essential
change
in
the
articles
of
confederation
as
proved
to
be
inadequate
to
secure
the
peace
security
and
prosperity
of
the
nation
all
the
proceedings
that
preceded
and
led
to
the
call
of
the
convention
of
were
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
were
one
people
the
states
were
called
united
not
confederated
states
even
in
the
very
articles
of
confederation
themselves
and
officially
the
united
states
were
called
the
union
that
the
united
colonies
by
independence
became
united
states
and
formed
really
one
and
only
one
people
was
in
the
thought
the
belief
the
instinct
of
the
great
mass
of
the
people
they
acted
as
they
existed
through
state
as
they
had
previously
acted
through
colonial
organization
for
in
throwing
off
the
british
authority
there
was
no
other
organization
through
which
they
could
act
the
states
or
people
of
the
states
severally
sent
their
delegates
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
these
delegates
adopted
the
rule
of
voting
in
congress
by
states
a
rule
that
might
be
revived
without
detriment
to
national
unity
nothing
was
more
natural
then
than
that
congress
composed
of
delegates
elected
or
appointed
by
states
should
draw
up
articles
of
confederation
rather
than
articles
of
union
in
order
if
for
no
other
reason
to
conciliate
the
smaller
states
and
to
prevent
their
jealousy
of
the
larger
states
such
as
virginia
massachusetts
and
pennsylvania
moreover
the
articles
of
confederation
were
drawn
up
and
adopted
during
the
transition
from
colonial
dependence
to
national
independence
independence
was
declared
in
but
it
was
not
a
fact
till
when
the
preliminary
treaty
acknowledging
it
was
signed
at
paris
till
then
the
united
states
were
not
an
independent
nation
they
were
only
a
people
struggling
to
become
an
independent
nation
prior
to
that
preliminary
treaty
neither
the
union
nor
the
states
severally
were
sovereign
the
articles
were
agreed
on
in
congress
in
but
they
were
not
ratified
by
all
the
states
till
may
and
in
the
movement
was
commenced
in
the
legislature
of
new
york
for
their
amendment
till
the
organization
under
the
constitution
ordained
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
and
which
went
into
operation
in
the
united
states
had
in
reality
only
a
provisional
government
and
it
was
not
till
then
that
the
national
government
was
definitively
organized
and
the
line
of
demarcation
between
the
general
government
and
the
particular
state
governments
was
fixed
the
confederation
was
an
acknowledged
failure
and
was
rejected
by
the
american
people
precisely
because
it
was
not
in
harmony
with
the
unwritten
or
providential
constitution
of
the
nation
and
it
was
not
in
harmony
with
that
constitution
precisely
because
it
recognized
the
states
as
severally
sovereign
and
substituted
confederation
for
union
the
failure
of
confederation
and
the
success
of
union
are
ample
proofs
of
the
unity
of
the
american
nation
the
instinct
of
unity
rejected
state
sovereignty
in
as
it
did
in
the
first
and
the
last
attempt
to
establish
state
sovereignty
have
failed
and
the
failure
vindicates
the
fact
that
the
sovereignty
is
in
the
states
united
not
in
the
states
severally
chapter
x
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
twofold
written
and
unwritten
the
constitution
of
the
people
and
the
constitution
of
the
government
the
written
constitution
is
simply
a
law
ordained
by
the
nation
or
people
instituting
and
organizing
the
government
the
unwritten
constitution
is
the
real
or
actual
constitution
of
the
people
as
a
state
or
sovereign
community
and
constituting
them
such
or
such
a
state
it
is
providential
not
made
by
the
nation
but
born
with
it
the
written
constitution
is
made
and
ordained
by
the
sovereign
power
and
presupposes
that
power
as
already
existing
and
constituted
the
unwritten
or
providential
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
peculiar
and
difficult
to
understand
because
incapable
of
being
fully
explained
by
analogies
borrowed
from
any
other
state
historically
known
or
described
by
political
philosophers
it
belongs
to
the
family
and
is
republican
as
distinguished
from
despotic
constitutions
but
it
comes
under
the
head
of
neither
monarchical
nor
aristocratic
neither
democratic
nor
mixed
constitutions
and
creates
a
state
which
is
neither
a
centralized
state
nor
a
confederacy
the
difficulty
of
understanding
it
is
augmented
by
the
peculiar
use
under
it
of
the
word
state
which
does
not
in
the
american
system
mean
a
sovereign
community
or
political
society
complete
in
itself
like
france
spain
or
prussia
nor
yet
a
political
society
subordinate
to
another
political
society
and
dependent
on
it
the
american
states
are
all
sovereign
states
united
but
disunited
are
no
states
at
all
the
rights
and
powers
of
the
states
are
not
derived
from
the
united
states
nor
the
rights
and
powers
of
the
united
states
derived
from
the
states
the
simple
fact
is
that
the
political
or
sovereign
people
of
the
united
states
exists
as
united
states
and
only
as
united
states
the
union
and
the
states
are
coeval
born
together
and
can
exist
only
together
separation
is
dissolution
the
death
of
both
the
united
states
are
a
state
a
single
sovereign
state
but
this
single
sovereign
state
consists
in
the
union
and
solidarity
of
states
instead
of
individuals
the
union
is
in
each
of
the
states
and
each
of
the
states
is
in
the
union
it
is
necessary
to
distinguish
in
the
outset
between
the
united
states
and
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
the
federal
government
which
the
convention
refused
contrary
to
its
first
intention
to
call
the
national
government
that
government
is
not
a
supreme
national
government
representing
all
the
powers
of
the
united
states
but
a
limited
government
restricted
by
its
constitution
to
certain
specific
relations
and
interests
the
united
states
are
anterior
to
that
government
and
the
first
question
to
be
settled
relates
to
their
internal
and
inherent
providential
constitution
as
one
political
people
or
sovereign
state
the
written
constitution
in
its
preamble
professes
to
be
ordained
by
we
the
people
of
the
united
states
who
are
this
people
how
are
they
constituted
or
what
the
mode
and
conditions
of
their
political
existence
are
they
the
people
of
the
states
severally
no
for
they
call
themselves
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
they
a
national
people
really
existing
outside
and
independently
of
their
organization
into
distinct
and
mutually
independent
states
no
for
they
define
themselves
to
be
the
people
of
the
united
states
if
they
had
considered
themselves
existing
as
states
only
they
would
have
said
we
the
states
and
if
independently
of
state
organization
they
would
have
said
we
the
people
do
ordain
the
key
to
the
mystery
is
precisely
in
this
appellation
united
states
which
is
not
the
name
of
the
country
for
its
distinctive
name
is
america
but
a
name
expressive
of
its
political
organization
in
it
there
are
no
sovereign
people
without
states
and
no
states
without
union
or
that
are
not
united
states
the
term
united
is
not
part
of
a
proper
name
but
is
simply
an
adjective
qualifying
states
and
has
its
full
and
proper
sense
hence
while
the
sovereignty
is
and
must
be
in
the
states
it
is
in
the
states
united
not
in
the
states
severally
precisely
as
we
have
found
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
is
in
the
people
collectively
or
as
society
not
in
the
people
individually
the
life
is
in
the
body
not
in
the
members
though
the
body
could
not
exist
if
it
had
no
members
so
the
sovereignty
is
in
the
union
not
in
the
states
severally
but
there
could
be
no
sovereign
union
without
the
states
for
there
is
no
union
where
there
is
nothing
united
this
is
not
a
theory
of
the
constitution
but
the
constitutional
fact
itself
it
is
the
simple
historical
fact
that
precedes
the
law
and
constitutes
the
power
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
one
people
as
has
already
been
proved
they
were
one
people
as
far
as
a
people
at
all
prior
to
independence
because
under
the
same
common
law
and
subject
to
the
same
sovereign
and
have
been
so
since
for
as
united
states
they
gained
their
independence
and
took
their
place
among
sovereign
nations
and
as
united
states
they
have
possessed
and
still
possess
the
government
as
their
existence
before
independence
in
distinct
colonies
did
not
prevent
their
unity
so
their
existence
since
in
distinct
states
does
not
hinder
them
from
being
one
people
the
states
severally
simply
continue
the
colonial
organizations
and
united
they
hold
the
sovereignty
that
was
originally
in
the
mother
country
but
if
one
people
they
are
one
people
existing
in
distinct
state
organizations
as
before
independence
they
were
one
people
existing
in
distinct
colonial
organizations
this
is
the
original
the
unwritten
and
providential
constitution
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
this
constitution
is
not
conventional
for
it
existed
before
the
people
met
or
could
meet
in
convention
they
have
not
as
an
independent
sovereign
people
either
established
their
union
or
distributed
themselves
into
distinct
and
mutually
independent
states
the
union
and
the
distribution
the
unity
and
the
distinction
are
both
original
in
their
constitution
and
they
were
born
united
states
as
much
and
as
truly
so
as
the
son
of
a
citizen
is
born
a
citizen
or
as
every
one
born
at
all
is
born
a
member
of
society
the
family
the
tribe
or
the
nation
the
union
and
the
states
were
born
together
are
inseparable
in
their
constitution
have
lived
and
grown
up
together
no
serious
attempt
till
the
late
secession
movement
has
been
made
to
separate
them
and
the
secession
movement
to
all
persons
who
knew
not
the
real
constitution
of
the
united
states
appeared
sure
to
succeed
and
in
fact
would
have
succeeded
if
as
the
secessionists
pretended
the
union
had
been
only
a
confederacy
and
the
states
had
been
held
together
only
by
a
conventional
compact
and
not
by
a
real
and
living
bond
of
unity
the
popular
instinct
of
national
unity
which
seemed
so
weak
proved
to
be
strong
enough
to
defeat
the
secession
forces
to
trample
out
the
confederacy
and
maintain
the
unity
of
the
nation
and
the
integrity
of
its
domain
the
people
can
act
only
as
they
exist
as
they
are
not
as
they
are
not
existing
originally
only
as
distributed
in
distinct
and
mutually
independent
colonies
they
could
at
first
act
only
through
their
colonial
organizations
and
afterward
only
through
their
state
organizations
the
colonial
people
met
in
convention
in
the
person
of
representatives
chosen
by
colonies
and
after
independence
in
the
person
of
representatives
chosen
by
states
not
existing
outside
of
the
colonial
or
state
organizations
they
could
not
act
outside
or
independently
of
them
they
chose
their
representatives
or
delegates
by
colonies
or
states
and
called
at
first
their
convention
a
congress
but
by
an
instinct
surer
than
their
deliberate
wisdom
they
called
it
not
the
congress
of
the
confederate
but
of
the
united
states
asserting
constitutional
unity
as
well
as
constitutional
multiplicity
it
is
true
in
their
first
attempt
to
organize
a
general
government
they
called
the
constitution
they
devised
articles
of
confederation
but
only
because
they
had
not
attained
to
full
consciousness
of
themselves
and
that
they
really
meant
union
not
confederation
is
evident
from
their
adopting
as
the
official
style
of
the
nation
or
new
power
united
not
confederate
states
that
the
sovereignty
vested
in
the
states
united
and
was
represented
in
some
sort
by
the
congress
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
the
several
states
when
they
wished
to
adopt
state
constitutions
in
place
of
colonial
charters
felt
not
at
liberty
to
do
so
without
asking
and
obtaining
the
permission
of
congress
as
the
elder
adams
informs
us
in
his
diary
kept
at
the
time
that
is
they
asked
and
obtained
the
equivalent
of
what
has
since
in
the
case
of
organizing
new
states
been
called
an
enabling
act
this
proves
that
the
states
did
not
regard
themselves
as
sovereign
states
out
of
the
union
but
as
completely
sovereign
only
in
it
and
this
again
proves
that
the
articles
of
confederation
did
not
correspond
to
the
real
living
constitution
of
the
people
even
then
it
was
felt
that
the
organization
and
constitution
of
a
state
in
the
union
could
be
regularly
effected
only
by
the
permission
of
congress
and
no
territory
can
it
is
well
known
regularly
organize
itself
as
a
state
and
adopt
a
state
constitution
without
an
enabling
act
by
congress
or
its
equivalent
new
states
indeed
have
been
organized
and
been
admitted
into
the
union
without
an
enabling
act
of
congress
but
the
case
of
kansas
if
nothing
else
proves
that
the
proceeding
is
irregular
illicit
invalid
and
dangerous
congress
of
course
can
condone
the
wrong
and
validate
the
act
but
it
were
better
that
the
act
should
be
validly
done
and
that
there
should
be
no
wrong
to
condone
territories
have
organized
as
states
adopted
state
constitutions
and
instituted
state
governments
under
what
has
been
called
squatter
sovereignty
but
such
sovereignty
has
no
existence
because
sovereignty
is
attached
to
the
domain
and
the
domain
is
in
the
united
states
it
is
the
offspring
of
that
false
view
of
popular
sovereignty
which
places
it
in
the
people
personally
or
generically
irrespective
of
the
domain
which
makes
sovereignty
a
purely
personal
right
not
a
right
fixed
to
the
soil
and
is
simply
a
return
to
the
barbaric
constitution
of
power
in
all
civilized
nations
sovereignty
is
inseparable
from
the
state
and
the
state
is
inseparable
from
the
domain
the
will
of
the
people
unless
they
are
a
state
is
no
law
has
no
force
binds
nobody
and
justifies
no
act
the
regular
process
of
forming
and
admitting
new
states
explains
admirably
the
mutual
relation
of
the
union
and
the
several
states
the
people
of
a
territory
belonging
to
the
united
states
or
included
in
the
public
domain
not
yet
erected
into
a
state
and
admitted
into
the
union
are
subjects
of
the
united
states
without
any
political
rights
whatever
and
though
a
part
of
the
population
are
no
part
of
the
sovereign
people
of
the
united
states
they
become
a
part
of
that
people
with
political
rights
and
franchises
only
when
they
are
erected
into
a
state
and
admitted
into
the
union
as
one
of
the
united
states
they
may
meet
in
convention
draw
up
and
adopt
a
constitution
declaring
or
assuming
them
to
be
a
state
elect
state
officers
senators
and
representatives
in
the
state
legislature
and
representatives
and
senators
in
congress
but
they
are
not
yet
a
state
and
are
as
before
under
the
territorial
government
established
by
the
general
government
it
does
not
exist
as
a
state
till
recognized
by
congress
and
admitted
into
the
union
the
existence
of
the
state
and
the
rights
and
powers
of
the
people
within
the
state
depend
on
their
being
a
state
in
the
union
or
a
state
united
hence
a
state
erected
on
the
national
domain
but
itself
outside
of
the
union
is
not
an
independent
foreign
state
but
simply
no
state
at
all
in
any
sense
of
the
term
as
there
is
no
union
outside
of
the
states
so
is
there
no
state
outside
of
the
union
and
to
be
a
citizen
either
of
a
state
or
of
the
united
states
it
is
necessary
to
be
a
citizen
of
a
state
and
of
a
state
in
the
union
the
inhabitants
of
territories
not
yet
erected
into
states
are
subjects
not
citizens
that
is
not
citizens
with
political
rights
the
sovereign
people
are
not
the
people
outside
of
state
organization
nor
the
people
of
the
states
severally
but
the
distinct
people
of
the
several
states
united
and
therefore
most
appropriately
called
the
people
of
the
united
states
this
is
the
peculiarity
of
the
american
constitution
and
is
substantially
the
very
peculiarity
noted
and
dwelt
upon
by
madison
in
his
masterly
letter
to
edward
everett
published
in
the
north
american
review
october
i
in
order
to
understand
the
true
character
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
says
madison
the
error
not
uncommon
must
be
avoided
of
viewing
it
through
the
medium
either
of
a
consolidated
government
or
of
a
confederated
government
whilst
it
is
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
but
a
mixture
of
both
and
having
in
no
model
the
similitudes
and
analogies
applicable
to
other
systems
of
government
it
must
more
than
any
other
be
its
own
interpreter
according
to
its
text
and
the
facts
in
the
case
from
these
it
will
be
seen
that
the
characteristic
peculiarities
of
the
constitution
are
the
mode
of
its
formation
the
division
of
the
supreme
powers
of
government
between
the
states
in
their
united
capacity
and
the
states
in
their
individual
capacities
it
was
formed
not
by
the
governments
of
the
component
states
as
the
federal
government
for
which
it
was
substituted
was
formed
nor
was
it
formed
by
a
majority
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
as
a
single
community
in
the
manner
of
a
consolidated
government
it
was
formed
by
the
states
that
is
by
the
people
in
each
of
the
states
acting
in
their
highest
sovereign
capacity
and
formed
consequently
by
the
same
authority
which
formed
the
state
constitution
being
thus
derived
from
the
same
source
as
the
constitutions
of
the
states
it
has
within
each
state
the
same
authority
as
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
is
as
much
a
constitution
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
term
within
its
prescribed
sphere
as
the
constitutions
of
the
states
are
within
their
respective
spheres
but
with
this
obvious
and
essential
difference
that
being
a
compact
among
the
states
in
their
highest
capacity
and
constituting
the
people
thereof
one
people
for
certain
purposes
it
can
not
be
altered
or
annulled
at
the
will
of
the
states
individually
as
the
constitution
of
a
state
may
be
at
its
individual
will
and
that
it
divides
the
supreme
powers
of
government
between
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
the
governments
of
the
individual
states
is
stamped
on
the
face
of
the
instrument
the
powers
of
war
and
of
taxation
of
commerce
and
treaties
and
other
enumerated
powers
vested
in
the
government
of
the
united
states
are
of
high
and
sovereign
a
character
as
any
of
the
powers
reserved
to
the
state
governments
jefferson
webster
chancellor
kent
judge
story
and
nearly
all
the
old
republicans
and
even
the
old
federalists
on
the
question
as
to
what
is
the
actual
constitution
of
the
united
states
took
substantially
the
same
view
but
they
all
as
well
as
madison
himself
speak
of
the
written
constitution
which
on
their
theory
has
and
can
have
only
a
conventional
value
madison
evidently
recognizes
no
constitution
of
the
people
prior
to
the
written
constitution
from
which
the
written
constitution
or
the
constitution
of
the
government
derives
all
its
force
and
vitality
the
organization
of
the
american
people
which
he
knew
well
no
man
better
and
which
he
so
justly
characterizes
he
supposes
to
have
been
deliberately
formed
by
the
people
themselves
through
the
convention
not
given
them
by
providence
as
their
original
and
inherent
constitution
but
this
was
merely
the
effect
of
the
general
doctrine
which
he
had
adopted
in
common
with
nearly
all
his
contemporaries
of
the
origin
of
the
state
in
compact
and
may
be
eliminated
from
his
view
of
what
the
constitution
actually
is
without
affecting
that
view
itself
madison
lays
great
stress
on
the
fact
that
though
the
constitution
of
the
union
was
formed
by
the
states
it
was
formed
not
by
the
governments
but
by
the
people
of
the
several
states
but
this
makes
no
essential
difference
if
the
people
are
the
people
of
the
states
and
sovereign
in
their
severalty
and
not
in
their
union
had
it
been
formed
by
the
state
governments
with
the
acquiescence
of
the
people
it
would
have
rested
on
as
high
authority
as
if
formed
by
the
people
of
the
state
in
convention
assembled
the
only
difference
is
that
if
the
state
ratified
it
by
the
legislature
she
could
abrogate
it
by
the
legislature
if
in
convention
she
could
abrogate
it
only
in
convention
madison
following
jefferson
supposes
the
constitution
makes
the
people
of
the
several
states
one
people
for
certain
specific
purposes
and
leaves
it
to
be
supposed
that
in
regard
to
all
other
matters
or
in
all
other
relations
they
are
sovereign
and
hence
he
makes
the
government
a
mixture
of
a
consolidated
government
and
a
confederated
government
but
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
exclusively
say
the
people
of
the
united
states
were
one
people
in
all
respects
and
under
a
government
which
is
neither
a
consolidated
nor
a
confederated
government
nor
yet
a
mixture
of
the
two
but
a
government
in
which
the
powers
of
government
are
divided
between
a
general
government
and
particular
governments
each
emanating
from
the
same
source
and
you
will
have
the
simple
fact
and
precisely
what
madison
means
when
is
eliminated
what
is
derived
from
his
theory
of
the
origin
of
government
in
compact
it
is
this
theory
of
the
conventional
origin
of
the
constitution
and
which
excludes
the
providential
or
real
constitution
of
the
people
that
has
misled
him
and
so
many
other
eminent
statesmen
and
constitutional
lawyers
the
convention
did
not
create
the
union
or
unite
the
states
for
it
was
assembled
by
the
authority
of
the
united
states
who
were
present
in
it
the
united
states
or
union
existed
before
the
convention
as
the
convention
itself
affirms
in
declaring
one
of
its
purposes
to
be
to
provide
for
a
more
perfect
union
if
there
had
been
no
union
it
could
not
and
would
not
have
spoken
of
providing
for
a
more
perfect
union
but
would
have
stated
its
purpose
to
be
to
create
or
form
a
union
the
convention
did
not
form
the
union
nor
in
fact
provide
for
a
more
perfect
union
it
simply
provided
for
the
more
perfect
representation
or
expression
in
the
general
government
of
the
union
already
existing
the
convention
in
common
with
the
statesmen
at
the
time
recognized
no
unwritten
or
providential
constitution
of
a
people
and
regarded
the
constitution
of
government
as
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
consequently
sometimes
put
the
state
for
the
government
in
interpreting
its
language
it
is
necessary
to
distinguish
between
its
act
and
its
theory
its
act
is
law
its
theory
is
not
the
convention
met
among
other
things
to
organize
a
government
which
should
more
perfectly
represent
the
union
of
the
states
than
did
the
government
created
by
the
articles
of
confederation
the
convention
certainly
professes
to
grant
or
concede
powers
to
the
united
states
and
to
prohibit
powers
to
the
states
but
it
simply
puts
the
state
for
the
government
the
powers
of
the
united
states
are
indeed
grants
or
trusts
but
from
god
through
the
law
of
nature
and
are
grants
trusts
or
powers
always
conceded
to
every
nation
or
sovereign
people
but
none
of
them
are
grants
from
the
convention
the
powers
the
convention
grants
or
concedes
to
the
united
states
are
powers
granted
or
conceded
by
the
united
states
to
the
general
government
it
assembled
to
organize
and
establish
which
as
it
extends
over
the
whole
population
and
territory
of
the
union
and
as
the
interests
it
is
charged
with
relate
to
all
the
states
in
common
or
to
the
people
as
a
whole
is
with
no
great
impropriety
called
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
contradistinction
from
the
state
governments
which
have
each
only
a
local
jurisdiction
but
the
more
exact
term
is
for
the
one
the
general
government
and
for
the
others
particular
governments
as
having
charge
only
of
the
particular
interests
of
the
state
and
the
two
together
constitute
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
the
complete
national
government
for
neither
the
general
government
nor
the
state
government
is
complete
in
itself
the
convention
developed
a
general
government
and
prescribed
its
powers
and
fixed
their
limits
and
extent
as
well
as
the
bounds
of
the
powers
of
the
state
or
particular
governments
but
they
are
the
united
states
assembled
in
convention
that
do
all
this
and
therefore
strictly
speaking
no
powers
are
conceded
to
the
united
states
that
they
did
not
previously
possess
the
convention
itself
in
the
constitution
it
ordained
defines
very
clearly
from
whom
the
general
government
holds
its
powers
it
holds
them
as
we
i
have
seen
from
we
the
people
of
the
united
states
not
we
the
people
of
the
states
severally
but
of
the
states
united
if
it
had
meant
the
states
severally
it
would
have
said
we
the
states
if
it
had
recognized
and
meant
the
population
of
the
country
irrespective
of
its
organization
into
particular
states
it
would
have
said
simply
we
the
people
by
saying
we
the
people
of
the
united
states
it
placed
the
sovereign
power
where
it
is
in
the
people
of
the
states
united
the
convention
ordains
that
the
powers
not
conceded
to
the
general
government
or
prohibited
to
the
particular
governments
are
reserved
to
the
states
respectively
or
to
the
people
but
the
powers
reserved
to
the
states
severally
are
reserved
by
order
of
the
united
states
and
the
powers
not
so
reserved
are
reserved
to
the
people
what
people
the
first
thought
is
that
they
are
the
people
of
the
states
severally
for
the
constitution
understands
by
people
the
state
as
distinguished
from
the
state
government
but
if
this
had
been
its
meaning
in
this
place
it
would
have
said
are
reserved
to
the
states
respectively
or
to
the
people
thereof
as
it
does
not
say
so
and
does
not
define
the
people
it
means
it
is
necessary
to
understand
by
them
the
people
called
in
the
preamble
the
people
of
the
united
states
this
is
confirmed
by
the
authority
reserved
to
amend
the
constitution
which
certainly
is
not
reserved
to
the
states
severally
but
necessarily
to
the
power
that
ordains
the
constitution
we
the
people
of
the
united
states
no
power
except
that
which
ordains
is
or
can
be
competent
to
amend
a
constitution
of
government
the
particular
mode
prescribed
by
the
convention
in
which
the
constitution
of
the
government
may
be
amended
has
no
bearing
on
the
present
argument
because
it
is
prescribed
by
the
states
united
not
severally
and
the
power
to
amend
is
evidently
reserved
not
indeed
to
the
general
government
but
to
the
united
states
for
the
ratification
by
any
state
or
territory
not
in
the
union
counts
for
nothing
the
states
united
can
in
the
way
prescribed
give
more
or
less
power
to
the
general
government
and
reserve
more
or
less
power
to
the
states
individually
the
reserved
powers
are
really
reserved
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
who
can
make
such
disposition
of
them
as
seems
to
them
good
the
conclusion
then
that
the
general
government
holds
from
the
states
united
not
from
the
states
severally
is
not
invalidated
by
the
fact
that
its
constitution
was
completed
only
by
the
ratification
of
the
states
in
their
individual
capacity
the
ratification
was
made
necessary
by
the
will
of
the
people
in
convention
assembled
but
the
convention
was
competent
to
complete
it
and
put
it
in
force
without
that
ratification
had
it
so
willed
the
general
practice
under
the
american
system
is
for
the
convention
to
submit
the
constitution
it
has
agreed
on
to
the
people
to
be
accepted
or
rejected
by
a
plebiscitum
but
such
submission
though
it
may
be
wise
and
prudent
is
not
necessary
the
convention
is
held
to
be
the
convention
of
the
people
and
to
be
clothed
with
the
full
authority
of
the
sovereign
people
and
it
is
in
this
that
it
differs
from
the
congress
or
the
legislature
it
is
not
a
congress
of
delegates
or
ministers
who
are
obliged
to
act
under
instructions
to
report
their
acts
to
their
respective
sovereigns
for
approval
or
rejection
it
is
itself
sovereign
and
may
do
whatever
the
people
themselves
can
do
there
is
no
necessity
for
it
to
appeal
to
a
plebiscitum
to
complete
its
acts
that
the
convention
on
the
score
of
prudence
is
wise
in
doing
so
nobody
questions
but
the
convention
is
always
competent
if
it
chooses
to
ordain
the
constitution
without
appeal
the
power
competent
to
ordain
the
constitution
is
always
competent
to
change
modify
or
amend
it
that
amendments
to
the
constitution
of
the
government
can
be
adopted
only
by
being
proposed
by
a
convention
of
all
the
states
in
the
union
or
by
being
proposed
by
a
vote
of
both
houses
of
congress
and
ratified
by
of
the
states
is
simply
a
conventional
ordinance
which
the
convention
can
change
at
its
pleasure
it
proves
nothing
as
it
stands
but
the
will
of
the
convention
the
term
ratification
itself
because
the
term
commonly
used
in
reference
to
treaties
between
sovereign
powers
has
been
seized
on
since
sometimes
used
by
the
convention
to
prove
that
the
constitution
emanates
from
the
states
severally
and
is
a
treaty
or
compact
between
sovereign
states
not
an
organic
or
fundamental
law
ordained
by
a
single
sovereign
will
but
this
argument
is
inadmissible
because
as
we
have
just
seen
the
convention
is
competent
to
ordain
the
constitution
without
submitting
it
for
ratification
and
because
the
convention
uses
sometimes
the
word
adopt
instead
of
the
word
ratify
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
held
it
to
be
a
treaty
compact
or
agreement
among
sovereigns
there
is
no
doubt
for
they
so
held
in
regard
to
all
constitution
of
government
and
there
is
just
as
little
doubt
that
they
intended
to
constitute
and
firmly
believed
that
they
were
constituting
a
real
government
madison
authority
on
this
point
is
conclusive
they
unquestionably
regarded
the
states
prior
to
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
they
proposed
as
severally
sovereign
as
they
were
declared
to
be
by
the
old
articles
of
confederation
but
they
also
believed
that
all
individuals
are
sovereign
prior
to
the
formation
of
civil
society
yet
very
few
if
any
of
them
believed
that
they
remained
sovereign
after
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
and
we
may
attribute
to
their
belief
in
the
conventional
origin
of
all
government
the
almost
universal
belief
of
the
time
among
political
philosophers
the
little
account
which
they
made
of
the
historical
facts
that
prove
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
were
always
one
people
and
that
the
states
never
existed
as
severally
sovereign
states
the
political
philosophers
of
the
present
day
do
not
generally
accept
the
theory
held
by
our
fathers
and
it
has
been
shown
in
these
pages
to
be
unsound
and
incompatible
with
the
essential
nature
of
government
the
statesmen
of
the
eighteenth
century
believed
that
the
state
is
derived
from
the
people
individually
and
held
that
sovereignty
is
created
by
the
people
in
convention
the
rights
and
powers
of
the
state
they
held
were
made
up
of
the
rights
held
by
individuals
under
the
law
of
nature
and
which
the
individuals
surrendered
to
civil
society
on
its
formation
so
they
supposed
that
independent
sovereign
states
might
meet
in
convention
mutually
agree
to
surrender
a
portion
of
their
rights
organize
their
surrendered
rights
into
a
real
government
and
leave
the
convention
shorn
at
least
of
a
portion
of
their
sovereignty
this
doctrine
crops
out
everywhere
in
the
writings
of
the
elder
adams
and
is
set
forth
with
rare
ability
by
webster
in
his
great
speech
in
the
senate
against
the
state
sovereignty
doctrine
of
general
hayne
and
calhoun
which
won
for
him
the
honorable
title
of
expounder
of
the
constitution
and
expound
it
he
no
doubt
did
in
the
sense
of
its
framers
he
boldly
concedes
that
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
the
people
of
the
united
states
were
severally
sovereign
states
but
by
the
constitution
they
were
made
one
sovereign
political
community
or
people
and
that
the
states
though
retaining
certain
rights
have
merged
their
several
sovereignty
in
the
union
the
subtle
mind
of
calhoun
who
did
not
hold
that
a
state
can
originate
in
compact
proved
to
webster
that
his
theory
could
not
stand
that
if
the
states
went
into
the
convention
sovereign
states
they
came
out
of
it
sovereign
states
and
that
the
constitution
they
formed
could
from
the
nature
of
the
case
be
only
a
treaty
compact
or
agreement
between
sovereigns
it
could
create
an
agency
but
not
a
government
the
sovereign
states
could
only
delegate
the
exercise
of
their
sovereign
powers
not
the
sovereign
powers
themselves
the
states
could
agree
to
exercise
certain
specific
powers
of
sovereignty
only
in
common
but
the
force
and
vitality
of
the
agreement
depended
on
the
states
parties
to
the
agreement
retaining
respectively
their
sovereignty
hence
he
maintained
that
sovereignty
after
as
before
the
convention
vested
in
the
states
severally
hence
state
sovereignty
and
hence
his
doctrine
that
in
all
cases
that
can
not
come
properly
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
for
decision
each
state
is
free
to
decide
for
itself
on
which
he
based
the
right
of
nullification
or
the
state
veto
of
acts
of
congress
whose
constitutionality
the
state
denies
calhoun
was
himself
no
secessionist
but
he
laid
down
the
premises
from
which
secession
is
the
logical
deduction
and
large
numbers
of
young
men
among
the
most
open
the
most
generous
and
the
most
patriotic
in
the
country
adopted
his
premises
without
being
aware
of
this
fact
any
more
than
he
himself
was
and
who
have
been
behind
none
in
their
loyalty
to
the
union
and
in
their
sacrifices
to
sustain
it
in
the
late
rebellion
the
formidable
rebellion
which
is
now
happily
suppressed
and
which
attempted
to
justify
itself
by
the
doctrine
of
state
sovereignty
has
thrown
in
many
minds
new
light
on
the
subject
and
led
them
to
the
historical
facts
in
the
case
from
a
different
point
of
view
to
see
if
calhoun
theory
is
not
as
unfounded
as
he
had
proved
webster
theory
to
be
the
facts
in
the
case
really
sustain
neither
and
both
failed
to
see
it
calhoun
because
he
had
purposes
to
accomplish
which
demanded
state
sovereignty
and
webster
because
he
examined
them
in
the
distorting
medium
of
the
theory
or
understanding
of
the
statesmen
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
civil
war
has
vindicated
the
union
and
defeated
the
armed
forces
of
the
state
sovereignty
men
but
it
has
not
refuted
their
doctrine
and
as
far
as
it
has
had
any
effect
it
has
strengthened
the
tendency
to
consolidation
or
centralism
but
the
philosophy
the
theory
of
government
the
understanding
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
must
be
considered
if
the
expression
will
be
allowed
as
obiter
dicta
and
be
judged
on
their
merits
what
binds
is
the
thing
done
not
the
theory
on
which
it
was
done
or
on
which
the
actors
explained
their
work
either
to
themselves
or
to
others
their
political
philosophy
or
their
political
theory
may
sometimes
affect
the
phraseology
they
adopt
but
forms
no
rule
for
interpreting
their
work
their
work
was
inspired
by
and
accords
with
the
historical
facts
in
the
case
and
is
authorized
and
explained
by
them
the
american
people
were
not
made
one
people
by
the
written
constitution
as
jefferson
madison
webster
and
so
many
others
supposed
but
were
made
so
by
the
unwritten
constitution
born
with
and
inherent
in
them
chapter
xi
the
constitution
continued
providence
or
god
operating
through
historical
facts
constituted
the
american
people
one
political
or
sovereign
people
existing
and
acting
in
particular
communities
organizations
called
states
this
one
people
organized
as
states
meet
in
convention
frame
and
ordain
the
constitution
of
government
or
institute
a
general
government
in
place
of
the
continental
congress
and
the
same
people
in
their
respective
state
organizations
meet
in
convention
in
each
state
and
frame
and
ordain
a
particular
government
for
the
state
individually
which
in
union
with
the
general
government
constitutes
the
complete
and
supreme
government
within
the
states
as
the
general
government
in
union
with
all
the
particular
governments
constitutes
the
complete
and
supreme
government
of
the
nation
or
whole
country
this
is
clearly
the
view
taken
by
madison
in
his
letter
to
everett
when
freed
from
his
theory
of
the
origin
of
government
in
compact
the
constitution
of
the
people
as
one
people
and
the
distinction
at
the
same
time
of
this
one
people
into
particular
states
precedes
the
convention
and
is
the
unwritten
constitution
the
providential
constitution
of
the
american
people
or
civil
society
as
distinguished
from
the
constitution
of
the
government
which
whether
general
or
particular
is
the
ordination
of
civil
society
itself
the
unwritten
constitution
is
the
creation
or
constitution
of
the
sovereign
and
the
sovereign
providentially
constituted
constitutes
in
turn
the
government
which
is
not
sovereign
but
is
clothed
with
just
so
much
and
just
so
little
authority
as
the
sovereign
wills
or
ordains
the
sovereign
in
the
republican
order
is
the
organic
people
or
state
and
is
with
us
the
united
states
for
with
us
the
organic
people
exist
only
as
organized
into
states
united
which
in
their
union
form
one
compact
and
indissoluble
whole
that
is
to
say
the
organic
american
people
do
not
exist
as
a
consolidated
people
or
state
they
exist
only
as
organized
into
distinct
but
inseparable
states
each
state
is
a
living
member
of
the
one
body
and
derives
its
life
from
its
union
with
the
body
so
that
the
american
state
is
one
body
with
many
members
and
the
members
instead
of
being
simply
individuals
are
states
or
individuals
organized
into
states
the
body
consists
of
many
members
and
is
one
body
because
the
members
are
all
members
of
it
and
members
one
of
another
it
does
not
exist
as
separate
or
distinct
from
the
members
but
exists
in
their
solidarity
or
membership
one
of
another
there
is
no
sovereign
people
or
existence
of
the
united
states
distinguishable
from
the
people
or
existence
of
the
particular
states
united
the
people
of
the
united
states
the
state
called
the
united
states
are
the
people
of
the
particular
states
united
the
solidarity
of
the
members
constitutes
the
unity
of
the
body
the
difference
between
this
view
and
madison
is
that
while
his
view
supposes
the
solidarity
to
be
conventional
originating
and
existing
in
compact
or
agreement
this
supposes
it
to
be
real
living
and
prior
to
the
convention
as
much
the
work
of
providence
as
the
existence
in
the
human
body
of
the
living
solidarity
of
its
members
one
law
one
life
circulates
through
all
the
members
constituting
them
a
living
organism
binding
them
in
living
union
all
to
each
and
each
to
all
such
is
the
sovereign
people
and
so
far
the
original
unwritten
constitution
the
sovereign
in
order
to
live
and
act
must
have
an
organ
through
which
he
expresses
his
will
this
organ
under
the
american
system
is
primarily
the
convention
the
convention
is
the
supreme
political
body
the
concrete
sovereign
authority
and
exercises
practically
the
whole
sovereign
power
of
the
people
the
convention
persists
always
although
not
in
permanent
session
it
can
at
any
time
be
convened
by
the
ordinary
authority
of
the
government
or
in
its
failure
by
a
plebiscitum
next
follows
the
government
created
and
constituted
by
the
convention
the
government
is
constituted
in
such
manner
and
has
such
and
only
such
powers
as
the
convention
ordains
the
government
has
in
the
strict
sense
no
political
authority
under
the
american
system
which
separates
the
government
from
the
convention
all
political
questions
proper
such
as
the
elective
franchise
eligibility
the
constitution
of
the
several
departments
of
government
as
the
legislative
the
judicial
and
the
executive
changing
altering
or
amending
the
constitution
of
government
enlarging
or
contracting
its
powers
in
a
word
all
those
questions
that
arise
on
which
it
is
necessary
to
take
the
immediate
orders
of
the
sovereign
belong
not
to
the
government
but
to
the
convention
and
where
the
will
of
the
sovereign
is
not
sufficiently
expressed
in
the
constitution
a
new
appeal
to
the
convention
is
necessary
and
may
always
be
had
the
constitution
of
great
britain
makes
no
distinction
between
the
convention
and
the
government
theoretically
the
constitution
of
great
britain
is
feudal
and
there
is
properly
speaking
no
british
state
there
are
only
the
estates
king
lords
and
commons
and
these
three
estates
constitute
the
parliament
which
is
held
to
be
omnipotent
that
is
has
the
plenitude
of
political
sovereignty
the
british
parliament
composed
of
the
three
estates
possesses
in
itself
all
the
powers
of
the
convention
in
the
american
constitution
and
is
at
once
the
convention
and
the
government
the
imperial
constitution
of
france
recognizes
no
convention
but
clothes
the
senate
with
certain
political
functions
which
in
some
respects
subjects
theoretically
the
sovereign
to
his
creature
the
emperor
confessedly
holds
his
power
by
the
grace
of
god
and
the
will
of
the
nation
which
is
a
clear
acknowledgment
that
the
sovereignty
vests
in
the
french
people
as
the
french
state
but
the
imperial
constitution
which
is
the
constitution
of
the
government
not
of
the
state
studies
while
acknowledging
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
to
render
it
nugatory
by
transferring
it
under
various
subtle
disguises
to
the
government
and
practically
to
the
emperor
as
chief
of
the
government
the
senate
the
council
of
state
the
legislative
body
and
the
emperor
are
all
creatures
of
the
french
state
and
have
properly
no
political
functions
and
to
give
them
such
functions
is
to
place
the
sovereign
under
his
own
subjects
the
real
aim
of
the
imperial
constitution
is
to
secure
despotic
power
under
the
guise
of
republicanism
it
leaves
and
is
intended
to
leave
the
nation
no
way
of
practically
asserting
its
sovereignty
but
by
either
a
revolution
or
a
plebiscitum
and
a
plebiscitum
is
permissible
only
where
there
is
no
regular
government
the
british
constitution
is
consistent
with
itself
but
imposes
no
restriction
on
the
power
of
the
government
the
french
imperial
constitution
is
illogical
inconsistent
with
itself
as
well
as
with
the
free
action
of
the
nation
the
american
constitution
has
all
the
advantages
of
both
and
the
disadvantages
of
neither
the
convention
is
not
the
government
like
the
british
parliament
nor
a
creature
of
the
state
like
the
french
senate
but
the
sovereign
state
itself
in
a
practical
form
by
means
of
the
convention
the
government
is
restricted
to
its
delegated
powers
and
these
if
found
in
practice
either
too
great
or
too
small
can
be
enlarged
or
contracted
in
a
regular
orderly
way
without
resorting
to
a
revolution
or
to
a
plebiscitum
whatever
political
grievances
there
may
be
there
is
always
present
the
sovereign
convention
competent
to
redress
them
the
efficiency
of
power
is
thus
secured
without
danger
to
liberty
and
freedom
without
danger
to
power
the
recognition
of
the
convention
the
real
political
sovereign
of
the
country
and
its
separation
from
and
independence
of
the
ordinary
government
is
one
of
the
most
striking
features
of
the
american
constitution
the
next
thing
to
be
noted
after
the
convention
is
the
constitution
by
the
convention
of
the
government
this
constitution
as
madison
well
observes
divides
the
powers
conceded
by
the
convention
to
government
between
the
general
government
and
the
particular
state
governments
strictly
speaking
the
government
is
one
and
its
powers
only
are
divided
and
exercised
by
two
sets
of
agents
or
ministries
this
division
of
the
powers
of
government
could
never
have
been
established
by
the
convention
if
the
american
people
had
not
been
providentially
constituted
one
people
existing
and
acting
through
particular
state
organizations
here
the
unwritten
constitution
or
the
constitution
written
in
the
people
themselves
rendered
practicable
and
dictated
the
written
constitution
or
constitution
ordained
by
the
convention
and
engrossed
on
parchment
it
only
expresses
in
the
government
the
fact
which
in
the
national
organization
and
life
this
division
of
the
powers
of
government
is
peculiar
to
the
united
states
and
is
an
effective
safeguard
against
both
feudal
disintegration
and
roman
centralism
misled
by
their
prejudices
and
peculiar
interests
a
portion
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
pleading
in
their
justification
the
theory
of
state
sovereignty
attempted
disintegration
secession
and
national
independence
separate
from
that
of
the
united
states
but
the
central
force
of
the
constitution
was
too
strong
for
them
to
succeed
the
unity
of
the
nation
was
too
strong
to
be
effectually
broken
no
doubt
the
reaction
against
secession
and
disintegration
will
strengthen
the
tendency
to
centralism
but
centralism
can
succeed
no
better
than
disintegration
has
succeeded
because
the
general
government
has
no
subsistentia
no
suppositum
to
borrow
a
theological
term
outside
or
independent
of
the
states
the
particular
governments
are
stronger
if
there
be
any
difference
to
protect
the
states
against
centralism
than
the
general
government
is
to
protect
the
union
against
disintegration
and
after
swinging
for
a
time
too
far
toward
one
extreme
and
then
too
far
toward
the
other
the
public
mind
will
recover
its
equilibrium
and
the
government
move
on
in
its
constitutional
path
republican
rome
attempted
to
guard
against
excessive
centralism
by
the
tribunitial
veto
or
by
the
organization
of
a
negative
or
obstructive
power
calhoun
thought
this
admirable
and
wished
to
effect
the
same
end
here
where
it
is
secured
by
other
more
effective
and
less
objectionable
means
by
a
state
veto
on
the
acts
of
congress
by
a
dual
executive
and
by
substituting
concurrent
for
numerical
majorities
imperial
rome
gradually
swept
away
the
tribunitial
veto
concentrated
all
power
in
the
hands
of
the
emperor
became
completely
centralized
and
fell
the
british
constitution
seeks
the
same
end
by
substituting
estates
for
the
state
and
establishing
a
mixed
government
in
which
monarchy
aristocracy
and
democracy
temper
check
or
balance
each
other
but
practically
the
commons
estate
has
become
supreme
and
the
nobility
govern
not
in
the
house
of
lords
and
can
really
influence
public
affairs
only
through
the
house
of
commons
the
principle
of
the
british
constitution
is
not
the
division
of
the
powers
of
government
but
the
antagonism
of
estates
or
rather
of
interests
trusting
to
the
obstructive
influence
of
that
antagonism
to
preserve
the
government
from
pure
centralism
hence
the
study
of
the
british
statesman
is
to
manage
diverse
and
antagonistic
parties
and
interests
so
as
to
gain
the
ability
to
act
which
he
can
do
only
by
intrigue
cajolery
bribery
in
one
form
or
another
and
corruption
of
every
sort
the
british
government
can
not
be
carried
on
by
fair
honest
and
honorable
means
any
more
than
could
the
roman
under
the
antagonism
created
by
the
tribunitial
veto
the
french
tried
the
english
system
of
organized
antagonism
in
as
a
cure
for
the
centralism
introduced
by
richelieu
and
louis
and
again
under
the
restoration
and
louis
philippe
and
called
it
the
system
of
constitutional
guarantees
but
they
could
never
manage
it
and
they
have
taken
refuge
in
unmitigated
centralism
under
napoleon
who
however
well
disposed
finds
no
means
in
the
constitution
of
the
french
nation
of
tempering
it
the
english
system
called
the
constitutional
and
sometimes
the
parliamentary
system
will
not
work
in
france
and
indeed
works
really
well
nowhere
the
american
system
sometimes
called
the
federal
system
is
not
founded
on
antagonism
of
classes
estates
or
interests
and
is
in
no
sense
a
system
of
checks
and
balances
it
needs
and
tolerates
no
obstructive
forces
it
does
not
pit
section
against
section
the
states
severally
against
the
general
government
nor
the
general
government
against
the
state
governments
and
nothing
is
more
hurtful
than
the
attempt
to
explain
it
and
work
it
on
the
principles
of
british
constitutionalism
the
convention
created
no
antagonistic
powers
it
simply
divided
the
powers
of
government
and
gave
neither
to
the
general
government
nor
to
the
state
governments
all
the
powers
of
government
nor
in
any
instance
did
it
give
to
the
two
governments
jurisdiction
in
the
same
matters
hence
each
has
its
own
sphere
in
which
it
can
move
on
without
colliding
with
that
of
the
other
each
is
independent
and
complete
in
relation
to
its
own
work
incomplete
and
dependent
on
the
other
for
the
complete
work
of
government
the
division
of
power
is
not
between
a
national
government
and
state
governments
but
between
a
general
government
and
particular
governments
the
general
government
inasmuch
as
it
extends
to
matters
common
to
all
the
states
is
usually
called
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
sometimes
the
federal
government
to
distinguish
it
from
the
particular
or
state
governments
but
without
strict
propriety
for
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
the
federal
government
means
in
strictness
both
the
general
government
and
the
particular
governments
since
neither
is
in
itself
the
complete
government
of
the
country
the
general
government
has
authority
within
each
of
the
states
and
each
of
the
state
governments
has
authority
in
the
union
the
line
between
the
union
and
the
states
severally
is
not
precisely
the
line
between
the
general
government
and
the
particular
governments
as
for
instance
the
general
government
lays
direct
taxes
on
the
people
of
the
states
and
collects
internal
revenue
within
them
and
the
citizens
of
a
particular
state
and
none
others
are
electors
of
president
and
of
the
united
states
and
representatives
in
the
lower
house
of
congress
while
senators
in
congress
are
elected
by
the
state
legislatures
themselves
the
line
that
distinguishes
the
two
governments
is
that
which
distinguishes
the
general
relations
and
interests
from
the
particular
relations
and
interests
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
these
general
relations
and
interests
are
placed
under
the
general
government
which
because
its
jurisdiction
is
coextensive
with
the
union
is
called
the
government
of
the
united
states
the
particular
relations
and
interests
are
placed
under
particular
governments
which
because
their
jurisdiction
is
only
coextensive
with
the
states
respectively
are
called
state
governments
the
general
government
governs
supremely
all
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
territories
belonging
to
the
union
in
all
their
general
relations
and
interests
or
relations
and
interests
common
alike
to
them
all
the
particular
or
state
government
governs
supremely
the
people
of
a
particular
state
as
massachusetts
new
york
or
new
jersey
in
all
that
pertains
to
their
particular
or
private
rights
relations
and
interests
the
powers
of
each
are
equally
sovereign
and
neither
are
derived
from
the
other
the
state
governments
are
not
subordinate
to
the
general
government
nor
the
general
government
to
the
state
governments
they
are
governments
each
standing
on
the
same
level
and
deriving
its
powers
from
the
same
sovereign
authority
in
their
respective
spheres
neither
yields
to
the
other
in
relation
to
the
matters
within
its
jurisdiction
each
government
is
independent
and
supreme
in
regard
of
the
other
and
subject
only
to
the
convention
the
powers
of
the
general
government
are
the
power
to
lay
and
collect
taxes
duties
imposts
and
excises
to
pay
the
debts
and
provide
for
the
general
welfare

these
with
the

and
places
of

are
of
a
general
nature
and
restricted
to
the
common
relations
and
interests
of
the
people
or
at
least
to
interests
and
relations
which
extend
beyond
the
limits
of
a
particular
state
they
are
all
powers
that
regard
matters
which
extend
beyond
not
only
the
individual
citizen
but
the
individual
state
and
affect
alike
the
relations
and
interests
of
all
the
states
or
matters
which
can
not
be
disposed
of
by
a
state
government
without
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
they
give
the
government
no
jurisdiction
of
questions
which
affect
individuals
or
citizens
only
in
their
private
and
domestic
relations
which
lie
wholly
within
a
particular
state
the
general
government
does
not
legislate
concerning
private
rights
whether
of
persons
or
things
the
tenure
of
real
estate
marriage
dower
inheritance
wills
the
transferrence

it
can
charter
no
private

out
of

establish
no

no

only
by
securing
to
authors
and
inventors
for
a
time
the
exclusive
right
to
their
writings
and
discoveries
the
united
states
bank
was
manifestly
unconstitutional
as
probably
are
the
present
national
banks
the
united
states
bank
was
a
private
or
particular
corporation
and
the
present
national
banks
are
only
corporations
of
the
same
sort
though
organized
under
a
general
law
the
pretence
that
they
are
established
to
supply
a
national
currency
does
not
save
their
constitutionality
for
the
convention
has
not
given
the
general
government
the
power
nor
imposed
on
it
the
duty
of
furnishing
a
national
currency
to
coin
money
and
regulate
the
value
thereof
is
something
very
different
from
authorizing
private
companies
to
issue
bank
notes
on
the
basis
of
the
public
stocks
held
as
private
property
or
even
on
what
is
called
a
specie
basis
to
claim
the
power
under
the
general
welfare
clause
would
be
a
simple
mockery
of
good
sense
it
is
no
more
for
the
general
welfare
than
any
other
successful
private
business
the
private
welfare
of
each
is
no
doubt
for
the
welfare
of
all
but
not
therefore
is
it
the
general
welfare
for
what
is
private
particular
in
its
nature
is
not
and
can
not
be
general
to
understand
by
general
welfare
that
which
is
for
the
individual
welfare
of
all
or
the
greater
number
would
be
to
claim
for
the
general
government
all
the
powers
of
government
and
to
deny
that
very
division
of
powers
which
is
the
crowning
merit
of
the
american
system
the
general
welfare
by
the
very
force
of
the
words
themselves
means
the
common
as
distinguished
from
the
private
or
individual
welfare
the
system
of
national
banks
may
or
may
not
be
a
good
and
desirable
system
but
it
is
difficult
to
understand
the
constitutional
power
of
the
general
government
to
establish
it
on
the
ground
that
its
powers
are
general
not
particular
the
general
government
has
no
power
to
lay
a
protective
tariff
it
can
lay
a
tariff
for
revenue
not
for
protection
of
home
manufactures
or
home
industry
for
the
interests
fostered
even
though
indirectly
advantageous
to
the
whole
people
are
in
their
nature
private
or
particular
not
general
interests
and
chiefly
interests
of
private
corporations
and
capitalists
their
incidental
or
even
consequential
effects
do
not
change
their
direct
and
essential
nature
so
with
domestic
slavery
slavery
comes
under
the
head
of
private
rights
whether
regarded
on
the
side
of
the
master
or
on
the
side
of
the
slave
the
right
of
a
citizen
to
hold
a
slave
if
a
right
at
all
is
the
private
right
of
property
and
the
right
of
the
slave
to
his
freedom
is
a
private
and
personal
right
and
neither
is
placed
under
the
safeguard
of
the
general
government
which
has
nowhere
unless
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
places
over
which
it
has
exclusive
legislative
power
in
all
cases
whatsoever
either
the
right
to
establish
it
or
to
abolish
it
except
perhaps
under
the
war
power
as
a
military
necessity
an
indemnity
for
the
past
or
a
security
for
the
future
this
applies
to
what
are
called
territories
as
well
as
to
the
states
the
right
of
the
government
to
govern
the
territories
in
regard
to
private
and
particular
rights
and
interests
is
derived
from
no
express
grant
of
power
and
is
held
only
ex
necessitate
the
united
states
owning
the
domain
and
there
being
no
other
authority
competent
to
govern
them
but
as
in
the
case
of
all
powers
held
ex
necessitate
the
power
is
restricted
to
the
absolute
necessity
in
the
case
what
are
called
territorial
governments
to
distinguish
them
from
the
state
governments
are
only
provisional
governments
and
can
touch
private
rights
and
interests
no
further
than
is
necessary
to
preserve
order
and
prepare
the
way
for
the
organization
and
installation
of
a
regular
state
government
till
then
the
law
governing
private
rights
is
the
law
that
was
in
force
if
any
such
there
was
when
the
territory
became
by
purchase
by
conquest
or
by
treaty
attached
to
the
domain
of
the
united
states
hence
the
supreme
court
declared
unconstitutional
the
ordinance
of
prohibiting
slavery
in
what
was
called
the
territory
of
the
northwest
and
the
missouri
compromise
prohibiting
slavery
north
of
the
parallel
the
wilmot
proviso
was
for
the
same
reason
unconstitutional
the
general
government
never
had
and
has
not
any
power
to
exclude
slavery
from
the
territories
any
more
than
to
abolish
it
in
the
states
but
slavery
being
a
local
institution
sustained
neither
by
the
law
of
nature
nor
the
law
of
nations
no
citizen
migrating
from
a
slave
state
could
carry
his
slaves
with
him
and
hold
them
as
slaves
in
the
territory
rights
enacted
by
local
law
are
rights
only
in
that
locality
and
slaves
carried
by
their
masters
into
a
slave
state
even
are
free
unless
the
state
into
which
they
are
carried
enacts
to
the
contrary
the
only
persons
that
could
be
held
as
slaves
in
a
territory
would
be
those
who
were
slaves
or
the
children
of
those
who
were
slaves
in
the
territory
when
it
passed
to
the
united
states
the
whole
controversy
on
slavery
in
the
territories
and
which
culminated
in
the
civil
war
was
wholly
unnecessary
and
never
could
have
occurred
had
the
constitution
been
properly
understood
and
adhered
to
by
both
sides
true
congress
could
not
exclude
slavery
from
the
territory
but
neither
could
citizens
migrating
to
them
hold
slaves
in
them
and
so
really
slavery
was
virtually
excluded
for
the
inhabitants
in
nearly
all
of
them
not
emigrants
from
the
states
after
the
cession
to
the
united
states
were
too
few
to
be
counted
the
general
government
has
power
to
establish
a
uniform
rule
of
naturalization
to
which
all
the
states
must
conform
and
it
was
very
proper
that
it
should
have
this
power
so
as
to
prevent
one
state
from
gaining
by
its
naturalization
laws
an
undue
advantage
over
another
but
the
general
government
has
itself
no
power
to
naturalize
a
single
foreigner
or
in
any
case
to
say
who
shall
or
who
shall
not
be
citizens
either
of
a
state
or
of
the
united
states
or
to
declare
who
may
or
may
not
be
electors
even
of
its
own
officers
the
convention
ordains
that
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
shall
be
chosen
by
electors
who
have
the
qualifications
requisite
for
electors
of
the
most
numerous
branch
of
the
state
legislature
but
the
state
determines
these
qualifications
and
who
do
or
do
not
possess
them
that
the
senators
shall
be
chosen
by
the
state
legislatures
and
that
the
electors
of
president
and
shall
be
appointed
in
such
manner
as
the
respective
state
legislatures
may
direct
the
whole
question
of
citizenship
what
shall
or
shall
not
be
the
qualifications
of
electors
who
shall
or
shall
not
be
freemen
is
reserved
to
the
states
as
coming
under
the
head
of
personal
or
private
rights
and
franchises
in
practice
the
exact
line
of
demarcation
may
not
always
have
been
strictly
observed
either
by
the
general
government
or
by
the
state
governments
but
a
careful
study
of
the
constitution
can
not
fail
to
show
that
the
division
of
powers
is
the
division
or
distinction
between
the
public
and
general
relations
and
interests
rights
and
duties
of
the
people
and
their
private
and
particular
relations
and
interests
rights
and
duties
as
these
two
classes
of
relations
and
interests
rights
and
duties
though
distinguishable
are
really
inseparable
in
nature
it
follows
that
the
two
governments
are
essential
to
the
existence
of
a
complete
government
or
to
the
existence
of
a
real
government
in
its
plenitude
and
integrity
left
to
either
alone
the
people
would
have
only
an
incomplete
an
initial
or
inchoate
government
the
general
government
is
the
complement
of
the
state
governments
and
the
state
governments
are
the
complement
of
the
general
government
the
consideration
of
the
powers
denied
by
the
convention
to
the
general
government
and
to
the
state
governments
respectively
will
lead
to
the
same
conclusion
to
the
general
government
is
denied
expressly
or
by
necessary
implication
all
jurisdiction
in
matters
of
private
rights
and
interests
and
to
the
state
government
is
denied
all
jurisdiction
in
right
or
interests
which
extend
as
has
been
said
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
state
no
state
shall
enter
into
any
treaty
alliance
or
confederation
grant
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
coin
money
emit
bills
of
credit
make
any
thing
but
gold
and
silver
coin
a
tender
in
the
payment
of
debts
pass
any
bill
of
attainder
ex
post
facto
law
or
law
impairing
the
obligation
of
contracts
or
grant
any
title
of
nobility
no
state
shall
without
the
consent
of
congress
lay
any
imposts
or
duties
on
imports
or
exports
except
what
may
be
absolutely
necessary
for
executing
its
inspection
laws
and
the
net
produce
of
all
duties
and
imposts
laid
by
any
state
on
imports
and
exports
shall
be
for
the
use
of
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
and
all
such
laws
shall
be
subject
to
the
revision
and
control
of
congress
no
state
shall
without
the
consent
of
congress
lay
any
duty
of
tonnage
keep
troops
or
in
time
of
peace
enter
into
any
agreement
or
compact
with
another
state
or
with
a
foreign
power
or
engage
in
war
unless
actually
invaded
or
in
such
imminent
danger
as
will
not
admit
of
delay
the
powers
denied
to
the
states
in
some
matters
which
are
rather
private
and
particular
such
as
bills
of
attainder
ex
post
facto
laws
laws
impairing
the
obligation
of
contracts
granting
titles
of
nobility
are
denied
equally
to
the
general
government
there
is
evidently
a
profound
logic
in
the
constitution
and
there
is
not
a
single
provision
in
it
that
is
arbitrary
or
anomalous
or
that
does
not
harmonize
dialectically
with
the
whole
and
with
the
real
constitution
of
the
american
people
at
first
sight
the
reservation
to
the
state
of
the
appointment
of
the
officers
of
the
militia
might
seem
an
anomaly
but
as
the
whole
subject
of
internal
police
belongs
to
the
state
it
should
have
some
military
force
at
its
command
the
subject
of
bankruptcies
also
might
seem
to
be
more
properly
within
the
province
of
the
state
and
so
it
would
be
if
commerce
between
the
several
states
had
not
been
placed
under
congress
or
if
trade
were
confined
to
the
citizens
of
the
state
and
within
its
boundaries
but
as
such
is
not
the
case
it
was
necessary
to
place
it
under
the
general
government
in
order
that
laws
on
the
subject
might
be
uniform
throughout
the
union
and
that
the
citizens
of
all
the
states
and
foreigners
trading
with
them
should
be
placed
on
an
equal
footing
and
have
the
same
remedies
the
subject
follows
naturally
in
the
train
of
commerce
for
bankruptcies
as
understood
at
the
time
were
confined
to
the
mercantile
class
bankers
and
brokers
and
since
the
regulation
of
commerce
foreign
and
was
to
be
placed
under
the
sole
charge
of
the
general
government
it
was
necessary
that
bankruptcy
should
be
included
the
subject
of
patents
is
placed
under
the
general
government
though
the
patent
is
a
private
right
because
it
was
the
will
of
the
convention
that
the
patent
should
be
good
in
all
the
states
as
affording
more
encouragement
to
science
and
the
useful
arts
than
if
good
only
within
a
single
state
or
if
the
power
were
left
to
each
state
to
recognize
or
not
patents
granted
by
another
the
right
created
though
private
in
its
nature
is
yet
general
or
common
to
all
the
states
in
its
enjoyment
or
exercise
the
division
of
the
powers
of
government
between
a
general
government
and
particular
governments
rendered
possible
and
practicable
by
the
original
constitution
of
the
people
themselves
as
one
people
existing
and
acting
through
state
organizations
is
the
american
method
of
guarding
against
the
undue
centralism
to
which
roman
imperialism
inevitably
tends
and
it
is
far
simpler
and
more
effective
than
any
of
the
european
systems
of
mixed
governments
which
seek
their
end
by
organizing
an
antagonism
of
interests
or
classes
the
american
method
demands
no
such
antagonism
no
neutralizing
of
one
social
force
by
another
but
avails
itself
of
all
the
forces
of
society
organizes
them
dialectically
not
antagonistically
and
thus
protects
with
equal
efficiency
both
public
authority
and
private
rights
the
general
government
can
never
oppress
the
people
as
individuals
or
abridge
their
private
rights
or
personal
freedom
and
independence
because
these
are
not
within
its
jurisdiction
but
are
placed
in
charge
within
each
state
of
the
state
government
which
within
its
sphere
governs
as
supremely
as
the
general
government
the
state
governments
can
not
weaken
the
public
authority
of
the
nation
or
oppress
the
people
in
their
general
rights
and
interests
for
these
are
withdrawn
from
state
jurisdiction
and
placed
under
charge
of
a
general
government
which
in
its
sphere
governs
as
supremely
as
the
state
government
there
is
no
resort
to
a
system
of
checks
and
balances
there
is
no
restraint
on
power
and
no
systematic
distrust
of
power
but
simply
a
division
of
powers
between
two
governments
distinct
but
inseparable
moving
in
distinct
spheres
but
in
the
same
direction
or
to
a
common
end
the
system
is
no
invention
of
man
is
no
creation
of
the
convention
but
is
given
us
by
providence
in
the
living
constitution
of
the
american
people
the
merit
of
the
statesmen
of
is
that
they
did
not
destroy
or
deface
the
work
of
providence
but
accepted
it
and
organized
the
government
in
harmony
with
the
real
orders
the
real
elements
given
them
they
suffered
themselves
in
all
their
positive
substantial
work
to
be
governed
by
reality
not
by
theories
and
speculations
in
this
they
proved
themselves
statesmen
and
their
work
survives
and
the
republic
laugh
as
sciolists
may
is
for
the
present
and
future
the
model
republic
as
much
so
as
was
rome
in
her
day
and
it
is
not
simply
national
pride
nor
american
that
pronounces
its
establishment
the
beginning
of
a
new
and
more
advanced
order
of
civilization
such
is
really
the
fact
the
only
apparently
weak
point
in
the
system
is
in
the
particular
states
themselves
feudalism
protected
the
feudal
aristocracy
effectively
for
a
time
against
both
the
king
and
the
people
but
left
the
king
and
the
people
without
protection
against
the
aristocracy
and
hence
it
fell
it
was
not
adequate
to
the
wants
of
civil
society
did
not
harmonize
all
social
elements
and
protect
all
social
and
individual
rights
and
interests
and
therefore
could
not
but
fail
the
general
government
takes
care
of
public
authority
and
rights
the
state
protects
private
rights
and
personal
freedom
as
against
the
general
government
but
what
protects
the
citizens
in
their
private
rights
their
personal
freedom
and
independence
against
the
particular
state
government
universal
suffrage
answers
the
democrat
armed
with
the
ballot
more
powerful
than
the
sword
each
citizen
is
able
to
protect
himself
but
this
is
theory
not
reality
if
it
were
true
the
division
of
the
powers
of
government
between
two
governments
would
be
of
no
practical
importance
experience
does
not
sustain
the
theory
and
the
power
of
the
ballot
to
protect
the
individual
may
be
rendered
ineffective
by
the
tyranny
of
party
experience
proves
that
the
ballot
is
far
less
effective
in
securing
the
freedom
and
independence
of
the
individual
citizen
than
is
commonly
pretended
the
ballot
of
an
isolated
individual
counts
for
nothing
the
individual
though
armed
with
the
ballot
is
as
powerless
if
he
stands
alone
as
if
he
had
it
not
to
render
it
of
any
avail
he
must
associate
himself
with
a
party
and
look
for
his
success
in
the
success
of
his
party
and
to
secure
the
success
of
his
party
he
must
give
up
to
it
his
own
private
convictions
and
free
will
in
practice
individuals
are
nothing
individually
and
parties
are
every
thing
even
the
suppression
of
the
late
rebellion
and
the
support
of
the
administration
in
doing
it
was
made
a
party
question
and
the
government
found
the
leaders
of
the
party
opposed
to
the
republican
party
an
obstacle
hardly
less
difficult
to
surmount
than
the
chiefs
of
the
armies
of
the
confederate
states
parties
are
formed
one
hardly
knows
how
and
controlled
no
one
knows
by
whom
but
usually
by
demagogues
men
who
have
some
private
or
personal
purposes
for
which
they
wish
through
party
to
use
the
government
parties
have
no
conscience
no
responsibility
and
their
very
reason
of
being
is
the
usurpation
and
concentration
of
power
the
real
practical
tendency
of
universal
suffrage
is
to
democratic
instead
of
an
imperial
centralism
what
is
to
guard
against
this
centralism
not
universal
suffrage
for
that
tends
to
create
it
and
if
the
government
is
left
to
it
the
government
becomes
practically
the
will
of
an
ever
shifting
and
irresponsible
majority
is
the
remedy
in
written
or
paper
constitutions
party
can
break
through
them
and
by
making
the
judges
elective
by
party
for
short
terms
and
can
do
so
with
impunity
in
several
of
the
states
the
dominant
majority
have
gained
the
power
to
govern
at
will
without
any
let
or
hindrance
besides
constitutions
can
be
altered
and
have
been
altered
very
nearly
at
the
will
of
the
majority
no
mere
paper
constitutions
are
any
protection
against
the
usurpations
of
party
for
party
will
always
grasp
all
the
power
it
can
yet
the
evil
is
not
so
great
as
it
seems
for
in
most
of
the
states
the
principle
of
division
of
powers
is
carried
into
the
bosom
of
the
state
itself
in
some
states
further
than
in
others
but
in
all
it
obtains
to
some
extent
in
what
are
called
the
new
england
states
the
best
governed
portion
of
the
union
each
town
is
a
corporation
having
important
powers
and
the
charge
of
all
purely
local
matters
chooses
its
own
officers
manages
its
own
finances
takes
charge
of
its
own
poor
of
its
own
roads
and
bridges
and
of
the
education
of
its
own
children
between
these
corporations
and
the
state
government
are
the
counties
that
take
charge
of
another
class
of
interests
more
general
than
those
under
the
charge
of
the
town
but
less
general
than
those
of
the
state
in
the
great
central
and
northwestern
states
the
same
system
obtains
though
less
completely
carried
out
in
the
southern
and
southwestern
states
the
town
corporations
hardly
exist
and
the
rights
and
interests
of
the
poorer
classes
of
persons
have
been
less
well
protected
in
them
than
in
the
northern
and
eastern
states
but
with
the
abolition
of
slavery
and
the
lessening
of
the
influence
of
the
wealthy
slaveholding
class
with
the
return
of
peace
and
the
revival
of
agricultural
industrial
and
commercial
prosperity
the
new
england
system
in
its
main
features
is
pretty
sure
to
be
gradually
introduced
or
developed
and
the
division
of
powers
in
the
state
to
be
as
effectively
and
as
systematically
carried
out
as
it
is
between
the
general
government
and
the
particular
or
state
governments
so
though
universal
suffrage
good
as
far
as
it
goes
is
not
alone
sufficient
the
division
of
powers
affords
with
it
a
not
inadequate
protection
no
government
whose
workings
are
intrusted
to
men
ever
is
or
can
be
practically
perfect
secure
all
good
and
guard
against
all
evil
in
all
human
governments
there
will
be
defects
and
abuses
and
he
is
no
wise
man
who
expects
perfection
from
imperfection
but
the
american
constitution
taken
as
a
whole
and
in
all
its
parts
is
the
least
imperfect
that
has
ever
existed
and
under
it
individual
rights
personal
freedom
and
independence
as
well
as
public
authority
or
society
are

chapter
xii
secession
the
doctrine
that
a
state
has
a
right
to
secede
and
carry
with
it
its
population
and
domain
has
been
effectually
put
down
and
the
unity
and
integrity
of
the
united
states
as
a
sovereign
nation
have
been
effectively
asserted
on
the
but
the
secessionists
though
disposed
to
submit
to
superior
force
and
demean
themselves
henceforth
as
loyal
citizens
most
likely
hold
as
firmly
to
the
doctrine
as
before
finding
themselves
unable
to
reduce
it
to
practice
and
the
union
victory
will
remain
incomplete
till
they
are
convinced
in
their
understandings
that
the
union
has
the
better
reason
as
well
as
the
superior
military
resources
the
nation
has
conquered
their
bodies
but
it
is
hardly
less
important
for
our
statesmen
to
conquer
their
minds
and
win
their
hearts
the
right
of
secession
is
not
claimed
as
a
revolutionary
right
or
even
as
a
conventional
right
the
secessionists
disclaim
revolutionary
principles
and
hold
that
the
right
of
secession
is
anterior
to
the
convention
a
right
which
the
convention
could
neither
give
nor
take
away
because
inherent
in
the
very
conception
of
a
sovereign
state
secession
is
simply
the
repeal
by
the
state
of
the
act
of
accession
to
the
union
and
as
that
act
was
a
free
voluntary
act
of
the
state
she
must
always
be
free
to
repeal
it
the
union
is
a
copartnership
a
state
in
the
union
is
simply
a
member
of
the
firm
and
has
the
right
to
withdraw
when
it
judges
it
for
its
interest
to
do
so
there
is
no
power
in
a
firm
to
compel
a
copartner
to
remain
a
member
any
longer
than
be
pleases
he
is
undoubtedly
holden
for
the
obligations
contracted
by
the
firm
while
he
remains
a
member
but
for
none
contracted
after
he
has
withdrawn
and
given
due
notice
thereof
so
of
a
sovereign
state
in
the
union
the
union
itself
apart
from
the
sovereign
states
that
compose
it
is
a
mere
abstraction
a
nullity
and
binds
nobody
all
its
substance
and
vitality
are
in
the
agreement
by
which
the
states
constitute
themselves
a
firm
or
copartnership
for
certain
specific
purposes
and
for
which
they
open
an
office
and
establish
an
agency
under
express
instructions
for
the
management
of
the
general
affairs
of
the
firm
the
state
is
held
jointly
and
severally
for
all
the
legal
obligations
of
the
union
contracted
while
she
is
in
it
but
no
further
and
is
free
to
withdraw
when
she
pleases
precisely
as
an
individual
may
withdraw
from
an
ordinary
business
firm
the
remaining
copartners
have
no
right
of
compulsion
or
coercion
against
the
seceding
member
for
he
saving
the
obligations
already
contracted
is
as
free
to
withdraw
as
they
are
to
remain
the
population
is
fixed
to
the
domain
and
goes
with
it
the
domain
is
attached
to
the
state
and
secedes
in
the
secession
of
the
state
secession
then
carries
the
entire
state
government
people
and
domain
out
of
the
union
and
restores
ipso
facto
the
state
to
its
original
position
of
a
sovereign
state
foreign
to
the
united
states
being
an
independent
sovereign
state
she
may
enter
into
a
new
confederacy
form
a
new
copartnership
or
merge
herself
in
some
other
foreign
state
as
she
judges
proper
or
finds
opportunity
the
states
that
seceded
formed
among
themselves
a
new
confederacy
more
to
their
mind
than
the
one
formed
in
as
they
had
a
perfect
right
to
do
and
in
the
war
just
ended
they
were
not
rebels
nor
revolutionists
but
a
people
fighting
for
the
right
of
loyal
citizens
and
true
patriots
defending
the
independence
and
inviolability
of
their
country
against
foreign
invaders
they
are
to
be
honored
for
their
loyalty
and
patriotism
and
not
branded
as
rebels
and
punished
as
traitors
this
is
the
secession
argument
which
rests
on
no
assumption
of
revolutionary
principles
or
abstract
rights
of
man
and
on
no
allegation
of
real
or
imaginary
wrongs
received
from
the
union
but
simply
on
the
original
and
inherent
rights
of
the
several
states
as
independent
sovereign
states
the
argument
is
conclusive
and
the
defence
complete
if
the
union
is
only
a
firm
or
copartnership
and
the
sovereignty
vests
in
the
states
severally
the
refutation
of
the
secessionists
is
in
the
facts
adduced
that
disprove
the
theory
of
state
sovereignty
and
prove
that
the
sovereignty
vests
not
in
the
states
severally
but
in
the
states
united
or
that
the
union
is
sovereign
and
not
the
states
individually
the
union
is
not
a
firm
a
copartnership
nor
an
artificial
or
conventional
union
but
a
real
living
constitutional
union
founded
in
the
original
and
indissoluble
unity
of
the
american
people
as
one
sovereign
people
there
is
indeed
no
such
people
if
we
abstract
the
states
but
there
are
no
states
if
we
abstract
this
sovereign
people
or
the
union
there
is
no
union
without
the
states
and
there
are
no
states
without
the
union
the
people
are
born
states
and
the
states
are
born
united
states
the
union
and
the
states
are
simultaneous
born
together
and
enter
alike
into
the
original
and
essential
constitution
of
the
american
state
this
the
facts
and
reasonings
adduced
fully
establish
but
this
one
sovereign
people
that
exists
only
as
organized
into
states
does
not
necessarily
include
the
whole
population
or
territory
included
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
it
is
restricted
to
the
people
and
territory
or
domain
organized
into
states
in
the
union
as
in
ancient
rome
the
ruling
people
were
restricted
to
the
tenants
of
the
sacred
territory
which
had
been
surveyed
and
its
boundaries
marked
by
the
god
terminus
and
which
by
no
means
included
all
the
territory
held
by
the
city
and
of
which
she
was
both
the
private
proprietor
and
the
public
sovereign
the
city
had
vast
possessions
acquired
by
confiscation
by
purchase
by
treaty
or
by
conquest
and
in
reference
to
which
her
celebrated
agrarian
laws
were
enacted
and
which
have
their
counterpart
in
our
homestead
and
kindred
laws
in
this
class
of
territory
of
which
the
city
was
the
private
owner
was
the
territory
of
all
the
roman
provinces
which
was
held
to
be
only
leased
to
its
occupants
who
were
often
dispossessed
and
their
lands
given
as
a
recompense
by
the
consul
or
imperator
to
his
disbanded
legionaries
the
provincials
were
subjects
of
rome
but
formed
no
part
of
the
roman
people
and
had
no
share
in
the
political
power
of
the
state
till
at
a
late
period
the
privileges
of
roman
citizens
were
extended
to
them
and
the
roman
people
became
coextensive
with
the
roman
empire
so
the
united
states
have
held
and
still
hold
large
territorial
possessions
acquired
by
the
acknowledgment
of
their
independence
by
great
britain
the
former
sovereign
the
cession
of
particular
states
and
purchase
from
france
spain
and
mexico
till
erected
into
states
and
admitted
into
the
union
this
territory
with
its
population
though
subject
to
the
united
states
makes
no
part
of
the
political
or
sovereign
territory
and
people
of
the
united
states
it
is
under
the
union
not
in
it
as
is
indicated
by
the
phrase
admitting
into
the
union
a
legal
phrase
since
the
constitution
ordains
that
new
states
may
be
admitted
by
the
congress
into
this
union
there
can
be
no
secession
that
separates
a
state
from
the
national
domain
and
withdraws
it
from
the
territorial
sovereignty
or
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
yet
what
hinders
a
state
from
going
out
of
the
union
in
the
sense
that
it
comes
into
it
and
thus
ceasing
to
belong
to
the
political
people
of
the
united
states
if
the
view
of
the
constitution
taken
in
the
preceding
chapters
be
correct
and
certainly
no
facts
tend
to
disprove
it
the
accession
of
a
territory
as
a
state
in
the
union
is
a
free
act
of
the
territorial
people
the
territory
can
not
organize
and
apply
for
admission
as
a
state
without
what
is
called
an
enabling
act
of
congress
or
its
equivalent
but
that
act
is
permissive
not
mandatory
and
nothing
obliges
the
territory
to
organize
under
it
and
apply
for
admission
it
may
do
so
or
not
as
it
chooses
what
then
hinders
the
state
once
in
the
union
from
going
out
or
returning
to
its
former
condition
of
territory
subject
to
the
union
the
original
states
did
not
need
to
come
in
under
an
enabling
act
for
they
were
born
states
in
the
union
and
were
never
territory
outside
of
the
union
and
subject
to
it
but
they
and
the
new
states
adopted
or
naturalized
states
once
in
the
union
stand
on
a
footing
of
perfect
equality
and
the
original
states
are
no
more
and
no
less
bound
than
they
to
remain
states
in
the
union
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
by
the
original
states
was
a
free
act
as
much
so
as
the
accession
of
a
new
state
formed
from
territory
subject
to
the
union
is
a
free
act
and
a
free
act
is
an
act
which
one
is
free
to
do
or
not
to
do
as
he
pleases
what
a
state
is
free
to
do
or
not
to
do
it
is
free
to
undo
if
it
chooses
there
is
nothing
in
either
the
state
constitution
or
in
that
of
the
united
states
that
forbids
it
this
is
denied
the
population
and
domain
are
inseparable
in
the
state
and
if
the
state
could
take
itself
out
of
the
union
it
would
take
them
out
and
be
ipso
facto
a
sovereign
state
foreign
to
the
union
it
would
take
the
domain
and
the
population
out
of
the
union
it
is
conceded
and
even
maintained
but
not
therefore
would
it
take
them
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
union
or
would
they
exist
as
a
state
foreign
to
the
union
for
population
and
territory
may
coexist
as
dacota
colorado
or
new
mexico
out
of
the
union
and
yet
be
subject
to
the
union
or
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
but
the
union
is
formed
by
the
surrender
by
each
of
the
states
of
its
individual
sovereignty
and
each
state
by
its
admission
into
the
union
surrenders
its
individual
sovereignty
or
binds
itself
by
a
constitutional
compact
to
merge
its
individual
sovereignty
in
that
of
the
whole
it
then
can
not
cease
to
be
a
state
in
the
union
without
breach
of
contract
having
surrendered
its
sovereignty
to
the
union
or
bound
itself
by
the
constitution
to
exercise
its
original
sovereignty
only
as
one
of
the
united
states
it
can
unmake
itself
of
its
state
character
only
by
consent
of
the
united
states
or
by
a
successful
revolution
it
is
by
virtue
of
this
fact
that
secession
is
rebellion
against
the
united
states
and
that
the
general
government
as
representing
the
union
has
the
right
and
the
duty
to
suppress
it
by
all
the
forces
at
its
command
there
can
be
no
rebellion
where
there
is
no
allegiance
the
states
in
the
union
can
not
owe
allegiance
to
the
union
for
they
are
it
and
for
any
one
to
go
out
of
it
is
no
more
an
act
of
rebellion
than
it
is
for
a
king
to
abdicate
his
throne
the
union
is
not
formed
by
the
surrender
to
it
by
the
several
states
of
their
respective
individual
sovereignty
such
surrender
could
as
we
have
seen
form
only
an
alliance
or
a
confederation
not
one
sovereign
people
and
from
an
alliance
or
confederation
the
ally
or
confederate
has
saving
its
faith
the
inherent
right
to
secede
the
argument
assumes
that
the
states
were
originally
each
in
its
individuality
a
sovereign
state
but
by
the
convention
which
framed
the
constitution
each
surrendered
its
sovereignty
to
the
whole
and
thus
several
sovereign
states
became
one
sovereign
political
people
governing
in
general
matters
through
the
general
government
and
in
particular
matters
through
particular
or
state
governments
this
is
madison
theory
and
also
webster
but
it
has
been
refuted
in
the
refutation
of
the
theory
that
makes
government
originate
in
compact
a
sovereign
state
can
undoubtedly
surrender
its
sovereignty
but
can
surrender
it
only
to
something
or
somebody
that
really
exists
for
to
surrender
to
no
one
or
to
nothing
is
as
has
been
shown
the
same
thing
as
not
to
surrender
at
all
and
the
union
being
formed
only
by
the
surrender
is
nothing
prior
to
it
or
till
after
it
is
made
and
therefore
can
be
no
recipient
of
the
surrender
besides
the
theory
is
the
reverse
of
the
fact
the
state
does
not
surrender
or
part
with
its
sovereignty
by
coming
into
the
union
but
acquires
by
it
all
the
rights
it
holds
as
a
state
between
the
original
states
and
the
new
states
there
is
a
difference
of
mode
by
which
they
become
states
in
the
union
but
none
in
their
powers
or
the
tenure
by
which
they
hold
them
the
process
by
which
new
states
are
actually
formed
and
admitted
into
the
union
discloses
at
once
what
it
is
that
is
gained
or
lost
by
admission
the
domain
and
population
before
the
organization
of
the
territory
into
one
of
the
united
states
are
subject
to
the
united
states
inseparably
attached
to
the
domain
of
the
union
and
under
its
sovereignty
the
territory
so
remains
organized
or
unorganized
under
a
territorial
government
created
by
congress
congress
by
an
enabling
act
permits
it
to
organize
as
a
state
to
call
a
convention
to
form
a
state
constitution
to
elect
under
it
in
such
way
as
the
convention
ordains
state
officers
a
state
legislature
and
in
the
way
prescribed
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
senators
and
representatives
in
congress
here
is
a
complete
organization
as
a
state
yet
though
called
a
state
it
is
no
state
at
all
and
is
simply
territory
without
a
single
particle
of
political
power
to
be
a
state
it
must
be
recognized
and
admitted
by
congress
as
a
state
in
the
union
and
when
so
recognized
and
admitted
it
possesses
in
union
with
the
other
united
states
supreme
political
sovereignty
jointly
in
all
general
matters
and
individually
in
all
private
and
particular
matters
the
territory
gives
up
no
sovereign
powers
by
coming
into
the
union
for
before
it
came
into
the
union
it
had
no
sovereignty
no
political
rights
at
all
all
the
rights
and
powers
it
holds
are
held
by
the
simple
fact
that
it
has
become
a
state
in
the
union
this
is
as
true
of
the
original
states
as
of
the
new
states
for
it
has
been
shown
in
the
chapter
on
the
united
states
that
the
original
british
sovereignty
under
which
the
colonies
were
organized
and
existed
passed
on
the
fact
of
independence
to
the
states
united
and
not
to
the
states
severally
hence
if
nine
states
had
ratified
the
constitution
and
the
other
four
had
stood
out
and
refused
to
do
it
which
was
within
their
competency
they
would
not
have
been
independent
sovereign
states
outside
of
the
union
but
territories
under
the
union
texas
forms
the
only
exception
to
the
rule
that
the
states
have
never
been
independent
of
the
union
all
the
other
new
states
have
been
formed
from
territory
subject
to
the
union
this
is
true
of
all
the
states
formed
out
of
the
territory
of
the
northwest
and
out
of
the
domain
ceded
by
france
spain
and
mexico
to
the
united
states
all
these
cessions
were
held
by
the
united
states
as
territory
immediately
subject
to
the
union
before
being
erected
into
states
and
by
far
the
larger
part
is
so
held
even
yet
but
texas
was
an
independent
foreign
state
and
was
annexed
as
a
state
without
having
been
first
subjected
as
territory
to
the
united
states
it
of
course
lost
by
annexation
its
separate
sovereignty
but
this
annexation
was
held
by
many
to
be
unconstitutional
it
was
made
when
the
state
sovereignty
theory
had
gained
possession
of
the
government
and
was
annexed
as
a
state
instead
of
being
admitted
as
a
state
formed
from
territory
belonging
to
the
united
states
for
the
very
purpose
of
committing
the
nation
to
that
theory
its
annexation
was
the
prologue
as
the
mexican
war
was
the
first
act
in
the
secession
drama
and
as
the
epilogue
is
the
suppression
of
the
rebellion
on
texan
soil
texas
is
an
exceptional
case
and
forms
no
precedent
and
can
not
be
adduced
as
invalidating
the
general
rule
omitting
texas
the
simple
fact
is
the
states
acquire
all
their
sovereign
powers
by
being
states
in
the
union
instead
of
losing
or
surrendering
them
our
american
statesmen
have
overlooked
or
not
duly
weighed
the
facts
in
the
case
because
holding
the
origin
of
government
in
compact
they
felt
no
need
of
looking
back
of
the
constitution
to
find
the
basis
of
that
unity
of
the
american
people
which
they
assert
neither
madison
nor
webster
felt
any
difficulty
in
asserting
it
as
created
by
the
convention
of
or
in
conceding
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
prior
to
the
union
and
denying
its
existence
after
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
if
it
were
not
that
they
held
that
the
state
originates
in
convention
or
the
social
compact
there
would
be
unpardonable
presumption
on
the
part
of
the
present
writer
in
venturing
to
hazard
an
assertion
contrary
to
theirs
but
if
their
theory
was
unsound
their
practical
doctrine
was
not
for
they
maintained
that
the
american
people
are
one
sovereign
people
and
quincy
adams
an
authority
inferior
to
neither
maintained
that
they
were
always
one
people
and
that
the
states
hold
from
the
union
not
the
union
from
the
states
the
states
without
the
union
cease
to
exist
as
political
communities
the
union
without
the
states
ceases
to
be
a
union
and
becomes
a
vast
centralized
and
consolidated
state
ready
to
lapse
from
a
civilized
into
a
barbaric
from
a
republican
to
a
despotic
nation
the
state
under
the
american
system
as
distinguished
from
territory
is
not
in
the
domain
and
population
fixed
to
it
nor
yet
in
its
exterior
organization
but
solely
in
the
political
powers
rights
and
franchises
which
it
holds
from
the
united
states
or
as
one
of
the
united
states
as
these
are
rights
not
obligations
the
state
may
resign
or
abdicate
them
and
cease
to
be
a
state
on
the
same
principle
that
any
man
may
abdicate
or
forego
his
rights
in
doing
so
the
state
breaks
no
oath
of
allegiance
fails
to
fulfil
no
obligation
she
contracted
as
a
state
she
simply
forgoes
her
political
rights
and
franchises
so
far
then
secession
is
possible
feasible
and
not
unconstitutional
or
unlawful
but
it
is
as
sumner
and
others
have
maintained
simply
state
suicide
nothing
hinders
a
state
from
committing
suicide
if
she
chooses
any
more
than
there
was
something
which
compelled
the
territory
to
become
a
state
in
the
union
against
its
will
it
is
objected
to
this
conclusion
that
the
states
were
prior
to
the
union
independent
sovereign
states
and
secession
would
not
destroy
the
state
but
restore
it
to
its
original
sovereignty
and
independence
as
the
secessionists
maintain
certainly
if
the
states
were
prior
to
the
union
sovereign
states
but
this
is
precisely
what
has
been
denied
and
disproved
for
prior
to
the
union
there
were
no
states
secession
restores
or
reduces
rather
the
state
to
the
condition
it
was
in
before
its
admission
into
the
union
but
that
condition
is
that
of
territory
or
a
territory
subject
to
the
united
states
and
not
that
of
an
independent
sovereign
state
the
state
holds
all
its
political
rights
and
powers
in
the
union
from
the
union
and
has
none
out
of
it
or
in
the
condition
in
which
its
population
and
domain
were
before
being
a
state
in
the
union
state
suicide
it
has
been
urged
releases
its
population
and
territory
from
their
allegiance
to
the
union
and
as
there
is
no
rebellion
where
there
is
no
allegiance
resistance
by
its
population
and
territory
to
the
union
even
war
against
the
union
would
not
be
rebellion
but
the
simple
assertion
of
popular
sovereignty
this
is
only
the
same
objection
in
another
form
the
lapse
of
the
state
releases
the
population
and
territory
from
no
allegiance
to
the
union
for
their
allegiance
to
the
union
was
not
contracted
by
their
becoming
a
state
and
they
have
never
in
their
state
character
owed
allegiance
to
the
united
states
a
state
owes
no
allegiance
to
the
united
states
for
it
is
one
of
them
and
is
jointly
sovereign
the
relation
between
the
united
states
and
the
state
is
not
the
relation
of
suzerain
and
liegeman
or
vassal
a
state
owes
no
allegiance
for
it
is
not
subject
to
the
union
it
is
never
in
their
state
capacity
that
its
population
and
territory
do
or
can
rebel
hence
the
government
has
steadily
denied
that
in
the
late
rebellion
any
state
as
such
rebelled
but
as
a
state
can
not
rebel
no
state
can
go
out
of
the
union
and
therefore
no
state
in
the
late
rebellion
has
seceded
and
the
states
that
passed
secession
ordinances
are
and
all
along
have
been
states
in
the
union
no
state
can
rebel
but
it
does
not
follow
therefrom
that
no
state
can
secede
or
cease
to
exist
as
a
state
it
only
follows
that
secession
in
the
sense
of
state
suicide
or
the
abdication
by
the
state
of
its
political
rights
and
powers
is
not
rebellion
nor
does
it
follow
from
the
fact
that
no
state
has
rebelled
that
no
state
has
ceased
to
be
a
state
or
that
the
states
that
passed
secession
ordinances
have
been
all
along
states
in
the
union
the
secession
ordinances
were
illegal
unconstitutional
not
within
the
competency
of
the
state
and
therefore
null
and
void
from
the
beginning
unconstitutional
illegal
and
not
within
the
competency
of
the
state
so
far
as
intended
to
alienate
any
portion
of
the
national
domain
and
population
thereto
annexed
they
certainly
were
and
so
far
were
void
and
of
no
effect
but
so
far
as
intended
to
take
the
state
simply
as
a
state
out
of
the
union
they
were
within
the
competency
of
the
state
were
not
illegal
or
unconstitutional
and
therefore
not
null
and
void
acts
unconstitutional
in
some
parts
and
constitutional
in
others
are
not
wholly
void
the
unconstitutionality
vitiates
only
the
unconstitutional
parts
the
others
are
valid
are
law
and
recognized
and
enforced
as
such
by
the
courts
the
secession
ordinances
are
void
because
they
were
never
passed
by
the
people
of
the
state
but
by
a
faction
that
overawed
them
and
usurped
the
authority
of
the
state
this
argument
implies
that
if
a
secession
ordinance
is
passed
by
the
people
proper
of
the
state
it
is
valid
which
is
more
than
they
who
urge
it
against
the
state
suicide
doctrine
are
prepared
to
concede
but
the
secession
ordinances
were
in
every
instance
passed
by
the
people
of
the
state
in
convention
legally
assembled
therefore
by
them
in
their
highest
state
capacity
in
the
same
capacity
in
which
they
ordain
and
ratify
the
state
constitution
itself
and
in
nearly
all
the
states
they
were
in
addition
ratified
and
confirmed
if
the
facts
have
been
correctly
reported
by
a
genuine
plebiscitum
or
direct
vote
of
the
people
in
all
cases
they
were
adopted
by
a
decided
majority
of
the
political
people
of
the
state
and
after
their
adoption
they
were
acquiesced
in
and
indeed
actively
supported
by
very
nearly
the
whole
people
the
people
of
the
states
adopting
the
secession
ordinances
were
far
more
unanimous
in
supporting
secession
than
the
people
of
the
other
states
were
in
sustaining
the
government
in
its
efforts
to
suppress
the
rebellion
by
coercive
measures
it
will
not
do
then
to
ascribe
the
secession
ordinances
to
a
faction
the
people
are
never
a
faction
nor
is
a
faction
ever
the
majority
there
has
been
a
disposition
at
the
north
encouraged
by
the
few
union
men
at
the
south
to
regard
secession
as
the
work
of
a
few
ambitious
and
unprincipled
leaders
who
by
their
threats
their
violence
and
their
overbearing
manner
forced
the
mass
of
the
people
of
their
respective
states
into
secession
against
their
convictions
and
their
will
no
doubt
there
were
leaders
at
the
south
as
there
are
in
every
great
movement
at
the
north
no
doubt
there
were
individuals
in
the
seceding
states
that
held
secession
wrong
in
principle
and
were
conscientiously
attached
to
the
union
no
doubt
also
there
were
men
who
adhered
to
the
union
not
because
they
disapproved
secession
but
because
they
disliked
the
men
at
the
head
of
the
movement
or
because
they
were
enough
to
see
that
it
could
not
succeed
that
the
union
must
be
the
winning
side
and
that
by
adhering
to
it
they
would
become
the
great
and
leading
men
of
their
respective
states
which
they
certainly
could
not
be
under
secession
others
sympathized
fully
with
what
was
called
the
southern
cause
held
firmly
the
right
of
secession
and
hated
cordially
the
yankees
but
doubted
either
the
practicability
or
the
expediency
of
secession
and
opposed
it
till
resolved
on
but
after
it
was
resolved
on
yielded
to
none
in
their
earnest
support
of
it
these
last
comprised
the
immense
majority
of
those
who
voted
against
secession
never
could
those
called
the
southern
leaders
have
carried
the
secession
ordinances
never
could
they
have
carried
on
the
war
with
the
vigor
and
determination
and
with
such
formidable
armies
as
they
collected
and
armed
for
four
years
making
at
times
the
destiny
of
the
union
well
nigh
doubtful
if
they
had
not
had
the
southern
heart
with
them
if
they
had
not
been
most
heartily
supported
by
the
overwhelming
mass
of
the
people
they
led
a
popular
not
a
factious
movement
no
state
it
is
said
again
has
seceded
or
could
secede
the
state
is
territorial
not
personal
and
as
no
state
can
carry
its
territory
and
population
out
of
the
union
no
state
can
secede
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
union
or
alienate
them
from
the
sovereign
or
national
domain
very
true
but
out
of
the
union
as
a
state
with
rights
powers
or
franchises
in
the
union
not
true
secession
is
political
not
territorial
but
the
state
holds
from
the
territory
or
domain
the
people
are
sovereign
because
attached
to
a
sovereign
territory
not
the
domain
because
held
by
a
sovereign
people
as
was
established
by
the
analysis
of
the
early
roman
constitution
the
territory
of
the
states
corresponds
to
the
sacred
territory
of
rome
to
which
was
attached
the
roman
sovereignty
that
territory
once
surveyed
and
consecrated
remained
sacred
and
the
ruling
territory
and
could
not
be
divested
of
its
sacred
and
governing
character
the
portions
of
the
territory
of
the
united
states
once
erected
into
states
and
consecrated
as
ruling
territory
can
never
be
deprived
except
by
foreign
conquest
or
successful
revolution
of
its
sacred
character
and
inviolable
rights
the
state
is
territorial
not
personal
and
is
constituted
by
public
not
by
private
wealth
and
is
always
respublica
or
commonwealth
in
distinction
from
despotism
or
monarchy
in
its
oriental
sense
which
is
founded
on
private
wealth
or
which
assumes
that
the
authority
to
govern
or
sovereignty
is
the
private
estate
of
the
sovereign
all
power
is
a
domain
but
there
is
no
domain
without
a
dominus
or
lord
in
oriental
monarchies
the
dominus
is
the
monarch
in
republics
it
is
the
public
or
people
fixed
to
the
soil
or
territory
that
is
the
people
in
their
territorial
and
not
in
their
personal
or
genealogical
relation
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
sovereign
only
within
the
territory
or
domain
of
the
united
states
and
their
sovereignty
is
a
state
because
fixed
attached
or
limited
to
that
specific
territory
it
is
fixed
to
the
soil
not
nomadic
in
barbaric
nations
power
is
nomadic
and
personal
or
genealogical
confined
to
no
locality
but
attaches
to
the
chief
and
follows
wherever
he
goes
the
gothic
chiefs
hold
their
power
by
a
personal
title
and
have
the
same
authority
in
their
tribes
on
the
po
or
the
rhone
as
on
the
banks
of
the
elbe
or
the
danube
power
migrates
with
the
chief
and
his
people
and
may
be
exercised
wherever
he
and
they
find
themselves
as
a
swedish
queen
held
when
she
ordered
the
execution
of
one
of
her
subjects
at
paris
without
asking
permission
of
the
territorial
lord
in
these
nations
power
is
a
personal
right
or
a
private
estate
not
a
state
which
exists
only
as
attached
to
the
domain
and
as
attached
to
the
domain
exists
independently
of
the
chief
or
the
government
the
distinction
is
between
public
domain
and
private
domain
the
american
system
is
republican
and
contrary
to
what
some
democratic
politicians
assert
the
american
democracy
is
territorial
not
personal
not
territorial
because
the
majority
of
the
people
are
agriculturists
or
landholders
but
because
all
political
rights
powers
or
franchises
are
territorial
the
sovereign
people
of
the
united
states
are
sovereign
only
within
the
territory
of
the
united
states
the
great
body
of
the
freemen
have
the
elective
franchise
but
no
one
has
it
save
in
his
state
his
county
his
town
his
ward
his
precinct
out
of
the
election
district
in
which
he
is
domiciled
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
has
no
more
right
to
vote
than
has
the
citizen
or
subject
of
a
foreign
state
this
explains
what
is
meant
by
the
attachment
of
power
to
the
territory
and
the
dependence
of
the
state
on
the
domain
the
state
in
republican
states
exists
only
as
inseparably
united
with
the
public
domain
under
feudalism
power
was
joined
to
territory
or
domain
but
the
domain
was
held
as
a
private
not
as
a
public
domain
all
sovereignty
rests
on
domain
or
proprietorship
and
is
dominion
the
proprietor
is
the
dominus
or
lord
and
in
republican
states
the
lord
is
society
or
the
public
and
the
domain
is
held
for
the
common
or
public
good
of
all
all
political
rights
are
held
from
society
or
the
dominus
and
therefore
it
is
the
elective
franchise
is
held
from
society
and
is
a
civil
right
as
distinguished
from
a
natural
or
even
a
purely
personal
right
as
there
is
no
domain
without
a
lord
or
dominus
territory
alone
can
not
possess
any
political
rights
or
franchises
for
it
is
not
a
domain
in
the
american
system
the
dominus
or
lord
is
not
the
particular
state
but
the
united
states
and
the
domain
of
the
whole
territory
whether
erected
into
particular
states
or
not
is
in
the
united
states
alone
the
united
states
do
not
part
with
the
dominion
of
that
portion
of
the
national
domain
included
within
a
particular
state
the
state
holds
the
domain
not
separately
but
jointly
as
inseparably
one
of
the
united
states
separated
it
has
no
dominion
is
no
state
and
is
no
longer
a
joint
sovereign
at
all
and
the
territory
that
it
included
falls
into
the
condition
of
any
other
territory
held
by
the
united
states
not
erected
into
one
of
the
united
states
lawyers
indeed
tell
us
that
the
eminent
domain
is
in
the
particular
state
and
that
all
escheats
are
to
the
state
not
to
the
united
states
all
escheats
of
private
estates
but
no
public
or
general
escheats
but
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
public
domain
the
united
states
are
the
dominus
but
they
have
by
the
constitution
divided
the
powers
of
government
between
a
general
government
and
particular
state
governments
and
ordained
that
all
matters
of
a
general
nature
common
to
all
the
states
should
be
placed
under
the
supreme
control
of
the
former
and
all
matters
of
a
private
or
particular
character
under
the
supreme
control
of
the
latter
the
eminent
domain
of
private
estates
is
in
the
particular
state
but
the
sovereign
authority
in
the
particular
state
is
that
of
the
united
states
expressing
itself
through
the
state
government
the
united
states
in
the
states
as
well
as
out
of
them
is
the
dominus
as
the
states
respectively
would
soon
find
if
they
were
to
undertake
to
alienate
any
part
of
their
domain
to
a
foreign
power
or
even
to
the
citizens
or
subjects
of
a
foreign
state
as
is
also
evident
from
the
fact
that
the
united
states
in
the
way
prescribed
by
the
constitution
may
enlarge
or
contract
at
will
the
rights
and
powers
of
the
states
the
mistake
on
this
point
grows
out
of
the
habit
of
restricting
the
action
of
the
united
states
to
the
general
government
and
not
recollecting
that
the
united
states
govern
one
class
of
subjects
through
the
general
government
and
another
class
through
state
governments
but
that
it
is
one
and
the
same
authority
that
governs
in
both
the
analogy
borrowed
from
the
roman
constitution
as
far
as
applicable
proves
the
reverse
of
what
is
intended
the
dominus
of
the
sacred
territory
was
the
city
or
the
roman
state
not
the
sacred
territory
itself
the
territory
received
the
tenant
and
gave
him
as
tenant
the
right
to
a
seat
in
the
senate
but
the
right
of
the
territory
was
derived
not
from
the
domain
but
from
the
dominus
that
is
the
city
but
the
city
could
revoke
its
grant
as
it
practically
did
when
it
conferred
the
privileges
of
roman
citizenship
on
the
provincials
and
gave
to
plebeians
seats
in
the
senate
moreover
nothing
in
roman
history
indicates
that
to
the
validity
of
a
senatus
consultum
it
was
necessary
to
count
the
vacant
domains
of
the
sacred
territory
the
particular
domain
must
under
the
american
system
be
counted
when
it
is
held
by
a
state
but
of
itself
alone
or
even
with
its
population
it
is
not
a
state
and
therefore
as
a
state
domain
is
vacant
and
without
any
political
rights
or
powers
whatever
to
argue
that
the
territory
and
population
once
a
state
in
the
union
must
needs
always
be
so
would
be
well
enough
if
a
state
in
the
union
were
individually
a
sovereign
state
for
territory
with
its
population
not
subject
to
another
is
always
a
sovereign
state
even
though
its
government
has
been
subverted
but
this
is
not
the
fact
for
territory
with
its
population
does
not
constitute
a
state
in
the
union
and
therefore
when
of
a
state
nothing
remains
but
territory
and
population
the
state
has
evidently
disappeared
it
will
not
do
then
to
maintain
that
state
suicide
is
impossible
and
that
the
states
that
adopted
secession
ordinances
have
never
for
a
moment
ceased
to
be
states
in
the
union
and
are
free
whenever
they
choose
to
send
their
representatives
and
senators
to
occupy
their
vacant
seats
in
congress
they
must
be
reorganized
first
there
would
also
be
some
embarrassment
to
the
government
in
holding
that
the
states
that
passed
the
secession
ordinance
remain
notwithstanding
states
in
the
union
the
citizens
of
a
state
in
the
union
can
not
be
rebels
to
the
united
states
unless
they
are
rebels
to
their
state
and
rebels
to
their
state
they
are
not
unless
they
resist
its
authority
and
make
war
on
it
the
authority
of
the
state
in
the
union
is
a
legal
authority
and
the
citizen
in
obeying
it
is
disloyal
neither
to
the
state
nor
to
the
union
the
citizens
in
the
states
that
made
war
on
the
united
states
did
not
resist
their
state
for
they
acted
by
its
authority
the
only
men
on
this
supposition
in
them
who
have
been
traitors
or
rebels
are
precisely
the
union
men
who
have
refused
to
go
with
their
respective
states
and
have
resisted
even
with
armed
force
the
secession
ordinances
the
several
state
governments
under
which
the
rebels
carried
on
the
war
for
the
destruction
of
the
union
if
the
states
are
in
the
union
were
legal
and
loyal
governments
of
their
respective
states
for
they
were
legally
elected
and
installed
and
conformed
to
their
respective
state
constitutions
all
the
acts
of
these
governments
have
been
constitutional
their
entering
into
a
confederacy
for
attaining
a
separate
nationality
has
been
legal
and
the
debts
contracted
by
the
states
individually
or
by
the
confederacy
legally
formed
by
them
have
been
legally
contracted
stand
good
against
them
and
perhaps
against
the
united
states
the
war
against
them
has
been
all
wrong
and
the
confederates
killed
in
battle
have
been
murdered
by
the
united
states
the
blockade
has
been
illegal
for
no
nation
can
blockade
its
own
ports
and
the
captures
and
seizures
under
it
robberies
the
supreme
court
has
been
wrong
in
declaring
the
war
a
territorial
civil
war
as
well
as
the
government
in
acting
accordingly
now
all
these
conclusions
are
manifestly
false
and
absurd
and
therefore
the
assumption
that
the
states
in
question
have
all
along
been
states
in
the
union
can
not
be
sustained
it
is
easy
to
understand
the
resistance
the
government
offers
to
the
doctrine
that
a
state
may
commit
suicide
or
by
its
own
act
abdicate
its
rights
and
cease
to
be
a
state
in
the
union
it
is
admissible
on
no
theory
of
the
constitution
that
has
been
widely
entertained
it
is
not
admissible
on
calhoun
theory
of
state
sovereignty
for
on
that
theory
a
state
in
going
out
of
the
union
does
not
cease
to
be
a
state
but
simply
resumes
the
powers
it
had
delegated
to
the
general
government
it
can
not
be
maintained
on
madison
or
theory
that
the
states
prior
to
the
union
were
severally
sovereign
but
by
the
union
were
constituted
one
people
for
if
this
one
people
are
understood
to
be
a
federal
people
state
secession
would
not
be
state
suicide
but
state
independence
and
if
understood
to
be
one
consolidated
or
centralized
people
it
would
be
simply
insurrection
or
rebellion
against
the
national
authority
laboring
to
make
itself
a
revolution
the
government
seems
to
have
understood
theory
in
both
senses
in
the
consolidated
sense
in
declaring
the
secessionists
insurgents
and
rebels
and
in
the
federal
sense
in
maintaining
that
they
have
never
seceded
and
are
still
states
in
the
union
in
full
possession
of
all
their
political
or
state
rights
perhaps
if
the
government
instead
of
borrowing
from
contradictory
theories
of
the
constitution
which
have
gained
currency
had
examined
in
the
light
of
historical
facts
the
constitution
itself
it
would
have
been
as
constitutional
in
its
doctrine
as
it
has
been
loyal
and
patriotic
energetic
and
successful
in
its
military
administration
another
reason
why
the
doctrine
that
state
secession
is
state
suicide
has
appeared
so
offensive
to
many
is
the
supposition
entertained
at
one
time
by
some
of
its
friends
that
the
dissolution
of
the
state
vacates
all
rights
and
franchises
held
under
it
but
this
is
a
mistake
the
principle
is
well
known
and
recognized
by
the
jurisprudence
of
all
civilized
nations
that
in
the
transfer
of
a
territory
from
one
territorial
sovereign
to
another
the
laws
in
force
under
the
old
sovereign
remain
in
force
after
the
change
till
abrogated
or
others
are
enacted
in
their
place
by
the
new
sovereign
except
such
as
are
necessarily
abrogated
by
the
change
itself
of
the
sovereign
not
indeed
because
the
old
sovereign
retains
any
authority
but
because
such
is
presumed
by
the
courts
to
be
the
will
of
the
new
sovereign
the
principle
applies
in
the
case
of
the
death
of
a
state
in
the
union
the
laws
of
the
state
are
territorial
till
abrogated
by
competent
authority
remain
the
lex
loci
and
are
in
full
force
all
that
would
be
vacated
would
be
the
public
rights
of
the
state
and
in
no
case
the
private
rights
of
citizens
corporations
or
laws
affecting
them
but
the
same
conclusion
is
reached
in
another
way
in
the
lapse
of
a
state
or
its
return
to
the
condition
of
a
territory
there
is
really
no
change
of
sovereignty
the
sovereignty
both
before
and
after
is
the
united
states
the
sovereign
authority
that
governs
in
the
state
government
as
we
have
seen
though
independent
of
the
general
government
is
the
united
states
the
united
states
govern
certain
matters
through
a
general
government
and
others
through
particular
state
governments
the
private
rights
and
interests
created
regulated
or
protected
by
the
particular
state
are
created
regulated
or
protected
by
the
united
states
as
much
and
as
plenarily
as
if
done
by
the
general
government
and
the
state
laws
creating
regulating
or
protecting
them
can
be
abrogated
by
no
power
known
to
the
constitution
but
either
the
state
itself
or
the
united
states
in
convention
legally
assembled
if
this
were
what
is
meant
by
the
states
that
have
seceded
or
professed
to
secede
remaining
states
in
the
union
they
would
indeed
be
states
still
in
the
union
notwithstanding
secession
and
the
government
would
be
right
in
saying
that
no
state
can
secede
but
this
is
not
what
is
meant
at
least
not
all
that
is
meant
it
is
meant
not
only
that
the
private
rights
of
citizens
and
corporations
remain
but
the
citizens
retain
all
the
public
rights
of
the
state
that
is
the
right
to
representation
in
congress
and
in
the
electoral
college
and
the
right
to
sit
in
the
convention
which
is
not
true
but
the
correction
of
the
misapprehension
that
the
private
rights
and
interests
are
lost
by
the
lapse
of
the
state
may
remove
the
graver
prejudices
against
the
doctrine
of
state
suicide
and
dispose
loyal
and
honest
union
men
to
bear
the
reasons
by
which
it
is
supported
and
which
nobody
has
refuted
or
can
refute
on
constitutional
grounds
a
territory
by
coming
into
the
union
becomes
a
state
a
state
by
going
out
of
the
union
becomes
a
territory
chapter
xiii
reconstruction
the
question
of
reconstructing
the
states
that
seceded
will
be
practically
settled
before
these
pages
can
see
the
light
and
will
therefore
be
considered
here
only
so
far
as
necessary
to
complete
the
view
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
manner
in
which
the
government
proposed
to
settle
has
settled
or
will
settle
the
question
proves
that
both
it
and
the
american
people
have
only
confused
views
of
the
rights
and
powers
of
the
general
government
but
imperfectly
comprehend
the
distinction
between
the
legislative
and
executive
departments
of
that
government
and
are
far
more
familiar
with
party
tactics
than
with
constitutional
law
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
any
thing
more
unconstitutional
more
crude
or
more
glaringly
impolitic
than
the
mode
of
reconstruction
indicated
by
the
various
executive
proclamations
that
have
been
issued
bearing
on
the
subject
or
even
by
the
bill
for
guaranteeing
the
states
republican
governments
that
passed
congress
but
which
failed
to
obtain
the
president
signature
it
is
in
some
measure
characteristic
of
the
american
government
to
understand
how
things
ought
to
be
done
only
when
they
are
done
and
it
is
too
late
to
do
them
in
the
right
way
its
wisdom
comes
after
action
as
if
engaged
in
a
series
of
experiments
but
happily
for
the
nation
few
blunders
are
committed
that
with
our
young
life
and
elasticity
are
irreparable
and
that
after
all
are
greater
than
are
ordinarily
committed
by
older
and
more
experienced
nations
they
are
not
of
the
most
fatal
character
and
are
for
the
most
part
such
as
are
incident
to
the
conceit
the
heedlessness
the
ardor
and
the
impatience
of
youth
and
need
excite
no
serious
alarm
for
the
future
there
has
been
no
little
confusion
in
the
public
mind
and
in
that
of
the
government
itself
as
to
what
reconstruction
is
who
has
the
power
to
reconstruct
and
how
that
power
is
to
be
exercised
are
the
states
that
seceded
states
in
the
union
with
no
other
disability
than
that
of
having
no
legal
governments
or
are
they
territories
subject
to
the
union
is
their
reconstruction
their
erection
into
new
states
or
their
restoration
as
states
previously
in
the
union
is
the
power
to
reconstruct
in
the
states
themselves
or
is
it
in
the
general
government
if
partly
in
the
people
and
partly
in
the
general
government
is
the
part
in
the
general
government
in
congress
or
in
the
executive
if
in
congress
can
the
executive
without
the
authority
of
congress
proceed
to
reconstruct
simply
leaving
it
for
congress
to
accept
or
reject
the
reconstructed
state
if
the
power
is
partly
in
the
people
of
the
disorganized
states
who
or
what
defines
that
people
decides
who
may
or
may
not
vote
in
the
reorganization
on
all
these
questions
there
has
been
much
crude
if
not
erroneous
thinking
and
much
inconsistent
and
contradictory
action
the
government
started
with
the
theory
that
no
state
had
seceded
or
could
secede
and
held
that
throughout
the
states
in
rebellion
continued
to
be
states
in
the
union
that
is
it
held
secession
to
be
a
purely
personal
and
not
a
territorial
insurrection
yet
it
proclaimed
eleven
states
to
be
in
insurrection
against
the
united
states
blockaded
their
ports
and
interdicted
all
trade
and
intercourse
of
any
kind
with
them
the
supreme
court
in
order
to
sustain
the
blockade
and
interdict
as
legal
decided
the
war
to
be
not
a
war
against
simply
individual
or
personal
insurgents
but
a
territorial
civil
war
this
negatived
the
assumption
that
the
states
that
took
up
arms
against
the
united
states
remained
all
the
while
peaceable
and
loyal
states
with
all
their
political
rights
and
powers
in
the
union
the
states
in
the
union
are
integral
elements
of
the
political
sovereignty
for
the
sovereignty
of
the
american
nation
vests
in
the
states
finite
and
it
is
absurd
to
pretend
that
the
eleven
states
that
made
the
rebellion
and
were
carrying
on
a
formidable
war
against
the
united
states
were
in
the
union
an
integral
element
of
that
sovereign
authority
which
was
carrying
on
a
yet
more
formidable
war
against
them
nevertheless
the
government
still
held
to
its
first
assumption
that
the
states
in
rebellion
continued
to
be
states
in
the
union
loyal
states
with
all
their
rights
and
franchises
unimpaired
that
the
government
should
at
first
have
favored
or
acquiesced
in
the
doctrine
that
no
state
had
ceased
to
be
a
state
in
the
union
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
the
extent
and
determination
of
the
secession
movement
were
imperfectly
understood
and
the
belief
among
the
supporters
of
the
government
and
perhaps
of
the
government
itself
was
that
it
was
a
spasmodic
movement
for
a
temporary
purpose
rather
than
a
fixed
determination
to
found
an
independent
separate
nationality
that
it
was
and
would
be
sustained
by
the
real
majority
of
the
people
of
none
of
the
states
with
perhaps
the
exception
of
south
carolina
that
the
true
policy
of
the
government
would
be
to
treat
the
seceders
with
great
forbearance
to
avoid
all
measures
likely
to
exasperate
them
or
to
embarrass
their
loyal
to
act
simply
on
the
defensive
and
to
leave
the
union
men
in
the
several
seceding
states
to
gain
a
political
victory
at
the
polls
over
the
secessionists
and
to
return
their
states
to
their
normal
position
in
the
union
the
government
may
not
have
had
much
faith
in
this
policy
and
lincoln
personal
authority
might
be
cited
to
the
effect
that
it
had
not
but
it
was
urged
strongly
by
the
union
men
of
the
border
states
the
administration
was
hardly
seated
in
office
and
its
members
were
new
men
without
administrative
experience
the
president
who
had
been
legally
elected
indeed
but
without
a
majority
of
the
popular
votes
was
far
from
having
the
full
confidence
even
of
the
party
that
elected
him
opinions
were
divided
party
spirit
ran
high
the
excitement
was
great
the
crisis
was
imminent
the
government
found
itself
left
by
its
predecessor
without
an
army
or
a
navy
and
almost
without
arms
or
ordnance
it
knew
not
how
far
it
could
count
on
popular
support
and
was
hardly
aware
whom
it
could
trust
or
should
distrust
all
was
hurry
and
confusion
and
what
could
the
government
do
but
to
gain
time
keep
off
active
war
as
long
as
possible
conciliate
all
it
could
and
take
ground
which
at
the
time
seemed
likely
to
rally
the
largest
number
of
the
people
to
its
support
there
were
men
then
warm
friends
of
the
administration
and
still
warmer
friends
of
their
country
who
believed
that
a
bolder
a
less
timid
a
less
cautious
policy
would
have
been
wiser
that
in
revolutionary
times
boldness
what
in
other
times
would
be
rashness
is
the
highest
prudence
on
the
side
of
the
government
as
well
as
on
the
side
of
the
revolution
that
when
once
it
has
shown
itself
the
rebellion
that
hesitates
deliberates
consults
is
defeated
and
so
is
the
government
the
seceders
owed
from
the
first
their
successes
not
to
their
superior
organization
to
their
better
preparation
or
to
the
better
discipline
and
appointment
of
their
armies
but
to
their
very
rashness
to
their
audacity
even
and
the
hesitancy
cautious
and
deliberation
of
the
government
napoleon
owed
his
successes
as
general
and
civilian
far
more
to
the
air
of
power
he
assumed
and
the
conviction
he
produced
of
his
invincibility
in
the
minds
of
his
opponents
than
to
his
civil
or
military
strategy
and
tactics
admirable
as
they
both
were
but
the
government
believed
it
wisest
to
adopt
a
conciliatory
and
in
many
respects
a
temporizing
policy
and
to
rely
more
on
weakening
the
secessionists
in
their
respective
states
than
on
strengthening
the
hands
and
hearts
of
its
own
staunch
and
uncompromising
supporters
it
must
strengthen
the
union
party
in
the
insurrectionary
states
and
as
this
party
hoped
to
succeed
by
political
manipulation
rather
than
by
military
force
the
government
must
rely
rather
on
a
show
of
military
power
than
on
gaining
any
decisive
battle
as
it
hoped
or
affected
to
hope
to
suppress
the
rebellion
in
the
states
that
seceded
through
their
loyal
citizens
it
was
obliged
to
assume
that
secession
was
the
work
of
a
faction
of
a
few
ambitious
and
disappointed
politicians
and
that
the
states
were
all
in
the
union
and
continued
in
the
loyal
portion
of
their
inhabitants
hence
its
aid
to
the
loyal
virginians
to
organize
as
the
state
of
virginia
and
its
subsequent
efforts
to
organize
the
union
men
in
louisiana
arkansas
and
tennessee
and
its
disposition
to
recognize
their
organization
in
each
of
those
states
as
the
state
itself
though
including
only
a
small
minority
of
the
territorial
people
had
the
facts
been
as
assumed
the
government
might
have
treated
the
loyal
people
of
each
state
as
the
state
itself
without
any
gross
usurpation
of
power
but
unhappily
the
facts
assumed
were
not
facts
and
it
was
soon
found
that
the
union
party
in
all
the
states
that
seceded
except
the
western
part
of
virginia
and
the
eastern
section
of
tennessee
after
secession
had
been
carried
by
the
popular
vote
went
almost
unanimously
with
the
secessionists
for
they
as
well
as
the
secessionists
held
the
doctrine
of
state
sovereignty
and
to
treat
the
handful
of
citizens
that
remained
loyal
in
each
state
as
the
state
itself
became
ridiculous
and
the
government
should
have
seen
and
acknowledged
it
the
rebellion
being
really
territorial
and
not
personal
the
state
that
seceded
was
no
more
continued
in
the
loyal
than
in
the
disloyal
population
while
the
war
lasted
both
were
public
enemies
of
the
united
states
and
neither
had
or
could
have
any
rights
as
a
state
in
the
union
the
law
recognizes
a
solidarity
of
all
the
citizens
of
a
state
and
assumes
that
when
a
state
is
at
war
all
its
citizens
are
at
war
whether
approving
the
war
or
not
the
loyal
people
in
the
states
that
seceded
incurred
none
of
the
pains
and
penalties
of
treason
but
they
retained
none
of
the
political
rights
of
the
state
in
the
union
and
in
reorganizing
the
state
after
the
suppression
of
the
rebellion
they
have
no
more
right
to
take
part
than
the
secessionists
themselves
they
as
well
as
the
secessionists
have
followed
the
territory
it
was
on
this
point
that
the
government
committed
its
gravest
mistake
as
to
the
reorganization
or
reconstruction
of
the
state
the
whole
territorial
people
stood
on
the
same
footing
taking
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
as
conclusive
on
the
subject
the
rebellion
was
territorial
and
therefore
placed
all
the
states
as
states
out
of
the
union
and
retained
them
only
as
population
and
territory
under
or
subject
to
the
union
the
states
ceased
to
exist
that
is
as
integral
elements
of
the
national
sovereignty
the
question
then
occurred
are
they
to
be
erected
into
new
states
or
are
they
to
be
reconstructed
and
restored
to
the
union
as
the
identical
old
states
that
seceded
shall
their
identity
be
revived
and
preserved
or
shall
they
be
new
states
regardless
of
that
identity
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
work
to
be
done
was
that
of
restoration
not
of
creation
no
tribe
should
perish
from
israel
no
star
be
struck
from
the
firmament
of
the
union
every
inhabitant
of
the
fallen
states
and
every
citizen
of
the
united
states
must
desire
them
to
be
revived
and
continued
with
their
old
names
and
boundaries
and
all
true
americans
wish
to
continue
the
constitution
as
it
is
and
the
union
as
it
was
who
would
see
old
virginia
the
virginia
of
revolutionary
fame
of
washington
jefferson
madison
of
monroe
the
old
dominion
once
the
leading
state
of
the
union
dead
without
hope
of
resurrection
or
south
carolina
the
land
of
rutledge
moultrie
laurens
hayne
sumter
and
marion
there
is
something
grating
to
him
who
values
state
associations
and
would
encourage
state
emulation
and
state
pride
in
the
mutilation
of
the
old
dominion
and
the
erection
within
her
borders
of
the
new
state
called
west
virginia
states
in
the
union
are
not
mere
prefectures
or
mere
dependencies
on
the
general
government
created
for
the
convenience
of
administration
they
have
an
individual
a
real
existence
of
their
own
as
much
so
as
have
the
individual
members
of
society
they
are
free
members
not
of
a
confederation
indeed
but
of
a
higher
political
community
and
reconstruction
should
restore
the
identity
of
their
individual
life
suspended
for
a
moment
by
secession
but
capable
of
resuscitation
these
states
had
become
indeed
for
a
moment
territory
under
the
union
but
in
no
instance
had
they
or
could
they
become
territory
that
had
never
existed
as
states
the
fact
that
the
territory
and
people
had
existed
as
a
state
could
with
regard
to
none
of
them
be
obliterated
and
therefore
they
could
not
be
erected
into
absolutely
new
states
the
process
of
reconstructing
them
could
not
be
the
same
as
that
of
creating
new
states
in
creating
a
new
state
congress
ex
necessitate
because
there
is
no
other
power
except
the
national
convention
competent
to
do
it
defines
the
boundaries
of
the
new
state
and
prescribes
the
electoral
people
or
who
may
take
part
in
the
preliminary
organization
but
in
reconstructing
states
it
does
neither
for
both
are
done
by
a
law
congress
is
not
competent
to
abrogate
or
modify
and
which
can
be
done
only
by
the
united
states
in
convention
assembled
or
by
the
state
itself
after
its
restoration
the
government
has
conceded
this
and
in
part
has
acted
on
it
it
preserves
except
in
virginia
the
old
boundaries
and
recognizes
or
rather
professes
to
recognize
the
old
electoral
law
only
it
claims
the
right
to
exclude
from
the
electoral
people
those
who
have
voluntarily
taken
part
in
the
rebellion
the
work
to
be
done
in
states
that
have
seceded
is
that
of
reconstruction
not
creation
and
this
work
is
not
and
can
not
be
done
exclusively
nor
chiefly
by
the
general
government
either
by
the
executive
or
by
congress
that
government
can
appoint
military
or
even
provisional
governors
who
may
designate
the
time
and
place
of
holding
the
convention
of
the
electoral
people
of
the
disorganized
state
as
also
the
time
and
place
of
holding
the
elections
of
delegates
to
it
and
superintend
the
elections
so
far
as
to
see
the
polls
are
opened
and
that
none
but
qualified
electors
vote
but
nothing
more
all
the
rest
is
the
work
of
the
territorial
electoral
people
themselves
for
the
state
within
its
own
sphere
must
as
one
of
the
united
states
be
a
community
the
general
government
may
concede
or
withhold
permission
to
the
disorganized
state
to
reorganize
as
it
judges
advisable
but
it
can
not
itself
reorganize
it
if
it
concedes
the
permission
it
must
leave
the
whole
electoral
people
under
the
preexisting
electoral
law
free
to
take
part
in
the
work
of
reorganization
and
to
vote
according
to
their
own
judgment
it
has
no
authority
to
purge
the
electoral
people
and
say
who
may
or
may
not
vote
for
the
whole
question
of
suffrage
and
the
qualifications
of
electors
is
left
to
the
state
and
can
be
settled
neither
by
an
act
of
congress
nor
by
an
executive
proclamation
if
the
government
theory
were
admissible
that
the
disorganized
states
remain
states
in
the
union
the
general
government
could
have
nothing
to
say
on
the
subject
and
could
no
more
interfere
with
elections
in
any
one
of
them
than
it
could
with
elections
in
massachusetts
or
new
york
but
even
on
the
doctrine
here
defended
it
can
interfere
with
them
only
by
way
of
general
superintendence
the
citizens
have
indeed
lost
their
political
rights
but
not
their
private
rights
secession
has
not
dissolved
civil
society
or
abrogated
any
of
the
laws
of
the
disorganized
state
that
were
in
force
at
the
time
of
secession
the
error
of
the
government
is
not
in
maintaining
that
these
laws
survive
the
secession
ordinances
and
remain
the
territorial
law
or
lex
loci
but
in
maintaining
that
they
do
so
by
will
of
the
state
that
has
as
a
state
really
lapsed
they
do
so
by
will
of
the
united
states
which
enacted
them
through
the
individual
state
and
which
has
not
in
convention
abrogated
them
save
the
law
authorizing
slavery
and
its
dependent
laws
this
point
has
already
been
made
but
as
it
is
one
of
the
niceties
of
the
american
constitution
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
elaborate
it
at
greater
length
the
doctrine
of
jefferson
madison
and
the
majority
of
our
jurists
would
see
to
be
that
the
states
under
god
are
severally
sovereign
in
all
matters
not
expressly
confided
to
the
general
government
and
therefore
that
the
american
sovereignty
is
divided
and
the
citizen
owes
a
double
allegiance
allegiance
to
his
state
and
allegiance
to
the
united
states
as
if
there
was
a
united
states
distinguishable
from
the
states
hence
seward
in
an
official
dispatch
to
our
minister
at
the
court
of
james
says
the
citizen
owes
allegiance
to
the
state
and
to
the
united
states
and
nearly
all
who
hold
allegiance
is
due
to
the
union
at
all
hold
that
it
is
also
due
to
the
states
only
that
which
is
due
to
the
united
states
is
paramount
as
that
under
feudalism
due
to
the
overlord
but
this
is
not
the
case
there
is
no
divided
sovereignty
no
divided
allegiance
sovereignty
is
one
and
vests
not
in
the
general
government
or
in
the
state
government
but
in
the
united
states
and
allegiance
is
due
to
the
united
states
and
to
them
alone
treason
can
be
committed
only
against
the
united
states
and
against
a
state
only
because
against
the
united
states
and
is
properly
cognizable
only
by
the
federal
courts
hence
the
union
men
committed
no
treason
in
refusing
to
submit
to
the
secession
ordinances
of
their
respective
states
and
in
sustaining
the
national
arms
against
secession
there
are
two
very
common
mistakes
the
one
that
the
states
individually
possess
all
the
powers
not
delegated
to
the
general
government
and
the
other
that
the
union
or
united
states
have
only
delegated
powers
but
the
united
states
possess
all
the
powers
of
a
sovereign
state
and
the
states
individually
and
the
general
government
possess
only
such
powers
as
the
united
states
in
convention
delegate
to
them
respectively
the
sovereign
is
neither
the
general
government
nor
the
states
severally
but
the
united
states
in
convention
the
united
states
are
the
one
indivisible
sovereign
and
this
sovereign
governs
alike
general
matters
in
the
general
government
and
particular
matters
in
the
several
state
governments
all
legal
authority
in
either
emanates
from
this
one
indivisible
and
plenary
sovereign
and
hence
the
law
enacted
by
a
state
are
really
enacted
by
the
united
states
and
derive
from
them
their
force
and
vitality
as
laws
hence
as
the
united
states
survive
the
particular
state
the
lapse
of
the
state
does
not
abrogate
the
state
laws
or
dissolve
civil
society
within
its
jurisdiction
this
is
evidently
so
because
civil
society
in
the
particular
state
does
not
rest
on
the
state
alone
nor
on
congress
but
on
the
united
states
hence
all
civil
rights
of
every
sort
created
by
the
individual
state
are
really
held
from
the
united
states
and
therefore
it
was
that
the
people
of
states
were
as
citizens
of
the
united
states
responsible
for
the
existence
of
slavery
in
the
states
that
seceded
there
is
a
solidarity
of
states
in
the
union
as
there
is
of
individuals
in
each
of
the
states
the
political
error
of
the
abolitionists
was
not
in
calling
upon
the
people
of
the
united
states
to
abolish
slavery
but
in
calling
upon
them
to
abolish
it
through
the
general
government
which
had
no
jurisdiction
in
the
case
or
in
their
sole
capacity
as
men
on
purely
humanitarian
grounds
which
were
the
abrogation
of
all
government
and
civil
society
itself
instead
of
calling
upon
them
to
do
it
as
the
united
states
in
convention
assembled
or
by
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
the
way
ordained
by
that
constitution
itself
this
understood
the
constitution
and
laws
of
a
defunct
state
remain
in
force
by
virtue
of
the
will
of
the
united
states
till
the
state
is
raised
from
the
dead
restored
to
life
and
activity
and
repeals
or
alters
them
or
till
they
are
repealed
or
altered
by
the
united
states
or
the
national
convention
but
as
the
defunct
state
could
not
and
the
convention
had
not
repealed
or
altered
them
save
in
the
one
case
mentioned
the
general
government
had
no
alternative
but
to
treat
them
and
all
rights
created
by
them
as
the
territorial
law
and
to
respect
them
as
such
what
then
do
the
people
of
the
several
states
that
seceded
lose
by
secession
they
lose
besides
incurring
so
far
as
disloyal
the
pains
and
penalties
of
treason
their
political
rights
or
right
as
has
just
been
said
to
be
in
their
own
department
communities
with
the
right
of
representation
in
congress
and
the
electoral
colleges
and
to
sit
in
the
national
convention
or
of
being
counted
in
the
ratification
of
amendments
to
the
constitution
precisely
what
it
was
shown
a
territorial
people
gain
by
being
admitted
as
a
state
into
the
union
this
is
the
difference
between
the
constitutional
doctrine
and
that
adopted
by
lincoln
and
johnson
administrations
but
what
authority
on
this
constitutional
doctrine
does
the
general
government
gain
over
the
people
of
states
that
secede
that
it
has
not
over
others
as
to
their
internal
constitution
their
private
rights
of
person
or
property
it
gains
none
it
has
over
them
till
they
are
reconstructed
and
restored
to
the
union
the
right
to
institute
for
them
provisional
governments
civil
or
military
precisely
as
it
has
for
the
people
of
a
territory
that
is
not
and
has
never
been
one
of
the
united
states
but
in
their
reconstruction
it
has
less
for
the
geographical
boundaries
and
electoral
people
of
each
are
already
defined
by
a
law
which
does
not
depend
on
its
will
and
which
it
can
neither
abrogate
nor
modify
here
is
the
difference
between
the
constitutional
doctrine
and
that
of
the
radicals
the
state
has
gone
but
its
laws
remain
so
far
as
the
united
states
in
convention
does
not
abrogate
them
not
because
the
authority
of
the
state
survives
but
because
the
united
states
so
will
or
are
presumed
to
will
the
united
states
have
by
a
constitutional
amendment
abrogated
the
laws
of
the
several
states
authorizing
slavery
and
prohibited
slavery
forever
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
union
and
no
state
can
now
be
reconstructed
and
be
admitted
into
the
union
with
a
constitution
that
permits
slavery
for
that
would
be
repugnant
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
if
the
constitutional
amendment
is
not
recognized
as
ratified
by
the
requisite
number
of
states
it
is
the
fault
of
the
government
in
persisting
in
counting
as
states
what
are
no
states
negro
suffrage
as
white
suffrage
is
at
present
a
question
for
states
the
united
states
guarantee
to
such
state
a
republican
form
of
government
and
this
guarantee
no
doubt
authorizes
congress
to
intervene
in
the
internal
constitution
of
a
state
so
far
as
to
force
it
to
adopt
a
republican
form
of
government
but
not
so
far
as
to
organize
a
government
for
a
state
or
to
compel
a
territorial
people
to
accept
or
adopt
a
state
constitution
for
themselves
if
a
state
attempts
to
organize
a
form
of
government
not
republican
it
can
prevent
it
and
if
a
territory
adopts
an
unrepublican
form
it
can
force
it
to
change
its
constitution
to
one
that
is
republican
or
compel
it
to
remain
a
territory
under
a
provisional
government
but
this
gives
the
general
government
no
authority
in
the
organization
or
of
states
beyond
seeing
that
the
form
of
government
adopted
by
the
territorial
people
is
republican
to
press
it
further
to
make
the
constitutional
clause
a
pretext
for
assuming
the
entire
control
of
the
organization
or
of
a
state
is
a
manifest
abuse
a
palpable
violation
of
the
constitution
and
of
the
whole
american
system
the
authority
given
by
the
clause
is
specific
and
is
no
authority
for
intervention
in
the
general
reconstruction
of
the
lapsed
state
it
gives
authority
in
no
question
raised
by
secession
or
its
consequences
and
can
give
none
except
from
within
or
from
without
there
is
an
overt
attempt
to
organize
a
state
in
the
union
with
an
unrepublican
form
of
government
the
general
government
gives
permission
to
the
territorial
people
of
the
defunct
state
to
or
it
contents
itself
with
suffering
them
without
special
recognition
to
reorganize
in
their
own
way
and
apply
to
congress
for
admission
leaving
it
to
congress
to
admit
them
as
a
state
or
not
according
to
its
own
discretion
in
like
manner
as
it
admits
a
new
state
but
the
itself
must
be
the
work
of
the
territorial
people
themselves
under
their
old
electoral
law
the
power
that
reconstructs
is
in
the
people
themselves
the
power
that
admits
them
or
receives
them
into
the
union
is
congress
the
executive
therefore
has
no
authority
in
the
matter
beyond
that
of
seeing
that
the
laws
are
duly
complied
with
and
whatever
power
he
assumes
whether
by
proclamation
or
by
instructions
given
to
the
provisional
governors
civil
or
military
is
simply
a
usurpation
of
the
power
of
congress
which
it
rests
with
congress
to
condone
or
not
as
it
may
see
fit
executive
proclamations
excluding
a
larger
or
a
smaller
portion
of
the
electoral
or
territorial
people
from
the
exercise
of
the
elective
franchise
in
reorganizing
the
state
and
executive
efforts
to
throw
the
state
into
the
hands
of
one
political
party
or
another
are
an
unwarrantable
assumption
of
power
for
the
president
in
relation
to
reconstruction
acts
only
under
the
peace
powers
of
the
constitution
and
simply
as
the
first
executive
officer
of
the
union
his
business
is
to
execute
the
laws
not
to
make
them
his
legislative
authority
is
confined
to
his
qualified
veto
on
the
acts
of
congress
and
to
the
recommendation
to
congress
of
such
measures
as
he
believes
are
needed
by
the
country
in
reconstructing
a
disorganized
state
neither
congress
nor
the
executive
has
any
power
that
either
has
not
in
time
of
peace
the
executive
as
of
the
army
may
ex
necessitate
pace
it
ad
interim
under
a
military
governor
but
he
can
not
appoint
even
a
provisional
civil
governor
till
congress
has
created
the
office
and
given
him
authority
to
fill
it
far
less
can
be
legally
give
instructions
to
the
civil
governor
as
to
the
mode
or
manner
of
reconstructing
the
disorganized
state
or
decide
who
may
or
may
not
vote
in
the
preliminary
reorganization
the
executive
could
do
nothing
of
the
sort
even
in
regard
to
a
territory
never
erected
into
a
state
it
belongs
to
congress
not
to
the
executive
to
erect
territorial
or
provisional
governments
like
those
of
dacotah
colorado
montana
nebraska
and
new
mexico
and
congress
not
the
executive
determines
the
boundaries
of
the
territory
passes
the
enabling
act
and
defines
the
electoral
people
till
the
state
is
organized
and
able
to
act
herself
even
congress
in
reconstructing
and
restoring
to
life
and
vigor
in
the
union
a
disorganized
state
has
nothing
to
say
as
to
its
boundaries
or
its
electoral
people
nor
any
right
to
interfere
between
parties
in
the
state
to
throw
the
reconstructed
state
into
the
hands
of
one
or
another
party
all
that
congress
can
insist
on
is
that
the
territorial
people
shall
reconstruct
with
a
government
republican
in
form
that
its
senators
and
representatives
in
congress
and
the
members
of
the
state
legislature
and
all
executive
and
judicial
officers
of
the
state
shall
be
bound
by
oath
or
affirmation
to
support
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
the
whole
work
the
president
has
nothing
to
do
with
reconstruction
except
to
see
that
peace
is
preserved
and
the
laws
are
fully
executed
it
may
be
at
least
doubted
that
the
executive
has
power
to
proclaim
amnesty
and
pardon
to
rebels
after
the
civil
war
has
ceased
and
ceased
it
has
when
the
rebels
have
thrown
down
their
arms
and
submitted
for
his
pardoning
power
is
only
to
pardon
after
conviction
and
judgment
of
the
court
it
is
certain
that
he
has
no
power
to
proscribe
or
punish
even
traitors
except
by
due
process
of
law
when
the
war
is
over
he
has
only
his
ordinary
peace
powers
he
can
not
then
disfranchise
any
portion
of
the
electoral
people
of
a
state
that
seceded
even
though
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
have
taken
part
in
the
rebellion
and
may
still
be
suspected
of
disloyal
sentiments
not
even
congress
can
do
it
and
no
power
known
to
the
constitution
till
the
state
is
reconstructed
can
do
it
without
due
process
of
law
except
the
national
convention
should
the
president
do
any
of
the
things
supposed
he
would
both
abuse
the
power
he
has
and
usurp
power
that
he
has
not
and
render
himself
liable
to
impeachment
there
are
many
things
very
proper
and
even
necessary
to
be
done
which
are
high
crimes
when
done
by
an
improper
person
or
agent
the
duty
of
the
president
when
there
are
steps
to
be
taken
or
things
to
be
done
which
he
believes
very
necessary
but
which
are
not
within
his
competency
is
if
congress
is
not
in
session
to
call
it
together
at
the
earliest
practicable
moment
and
submit
the
matter
to
its
wisdom
and
discretion
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
late
rebellion
was
not
a
merely
personal
but
a
territorial
rebellion
in
such
a
rebellion
embracing
eleven
states
and
excluding
slaves
a
population
of
at
least
seven
millions
acting
under
an
organized
territorial
government
preserving
internal
civil
order
supporting
an
army
and
navy
under
regularly
commissioned
officers
and
carrying
on
war
as
a
sovereign
nation
in
such
a
territorial
rebellion
no
one
in
particular
can
be
accused
and
punished
as
a
traitor
the
rebellion
is
not
the
work
of
a
few
ambitious
or
reckless
leaders
but
of
the
people
and
the
responsibility
of
the
crime
whether
civil
or
military
is
not
individual
but
common
to
the
whole
territorial
people
engaged
in
it
and
seven
millions
or
the
half
of
them
are
too
many
to
ban
to
exile
or
even
to
disfranchise
their
defeat
and
the
failure
of
their
cause
must
be
their
punishment
the
interest
of
the
country
as
well
the
sentiment
of
the
civilized
world
it
might
almost
be
said
the
law
of
nations
demands
their
permission
to
return
to
their
allegiance
to
be
treated
according
to
their
future
merits
as
an
integral
portion
of
the
american
people
the
sentiment
of
the
civilized
world
has
much
relaxed
from
its
former
severity
toward
political
offenders
it
regards
with
horror
the
savage
cruelties
of
great
britain
to
the
unfortunate
jacobites
after
their
defeat
under
charles
edward
at
culloden
in
their
barbarous
treatment
of
the
united
irishmen
in
and
her
brutality
to
the
mutinous
hindoos
in
the
harshness
of
russia
toward
the
insurgent
poles
defeated
in
their
mad
attempts
to
recover
their
lost
nationality
the
severity
of
austria
under
haynau
toward
the
defeated
magyars
the
liberal
press
kept
up
for
years
especially
in
england
and
the
united
states
a
perpetual
howl
against
the
papal
and
neapolitan
governments
for
arresting
and
imprisoning
men
who
conspired
to
overthrow
them
louis
kossuth
was
no
less
a
traitor
than
jefferson
davis
and
yet
the
united
states
solicited
his
release
from
a
turkish
prison
and
sent
a
national
ship
to
bring
him
hither
as
the
guest
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
held
from
the
first
the
right
of
insurrection
and
have
given
their
moral
support
to
every
insurrection
in
the
old
or
new
world
they
discovered
and
for
them
to
treat
with
severity
any
portion
of
the
southern
secessionists
who
at
the
very
worst
only
acted
on
the
principles
the
nation
had
uniformly
avowed
and
pronounced
sacred
would
be
regarded
and
justly
by
the
civilized
world
as
little
less
than
infamous
not
only
the
fair
fame
but
the
interest
of
the
union
forbids
any
severity
toward
the
people
lately
in
arms
against
the
government
the
interest
of
the
nation
demands
not
the
death
or
the
expulsion
of
the
secessionists
and
least
of
all
of
those
classes
proscribed
by
the
president
proclamation
of
the
of
may
nor
even
their
disfranchisement
perpetual
or
temporary
but
their
restoration
to
citizenship
and
their
loyal
with
all
americans
in
hearing
the
wounds
inflicted
on
the
whole
country
by
the
civil
war
there
need
be
no
fear
to
trust
them
their
cause
is
lost
they
may
or
may
not
regret
it
but
lost
it
is
and
lost
forever
they
appealed
to
the
and
were
defeated
they
appealed
from
the
to
arms
to
war
and
have
been
again
defeated
terribly
defeated
they
know
it
and
feel
it
there
is
no
further
appeal
for
them
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
last
resort
has
been
rendered
and
rendered
against
them
the
cause
is
finished
the
controversy
closed
never
to
be
henceforth
the
union
is
invincible
and
it
is
worse
than
idle
to
attempt
to
renew
the
war
against
it
henceforth
their
lot
is
bound
up
with
that
of
the
nation
and
all
their
hopes
and
interests
for
themselves
and
their
children
and
their
children
depend
on
their
being
permitted
to
demean
themselves
henceforth
as
peaceable
and
loyal
american
citizens
they
must
seek
their
freedom
greatness
and
glory
in
the
freedom
greatness
and
glory
of
the
american
republic
in
which
after
all
they
can
be
far
freer
greater
more
glorious
than
in
a
separate
and
independent
confederacy
all
the
arguments
and
considerations
urged
by
union
men
against
their
secession
come
back
to
them
now
with
redoubled
force
to
keep
them
henceforth
loyal
to
the
union
they
can
not
afford
to
lose
the
nation
and
the
nation
can
not
afford
to
lose
them
to
hang
or
exile
them
and
depopulate
and
suffer
to
run
to
waste
the
lands
they
had
cultivated
were
sad
thrift
sadder
than
that
of
deporting
four
millions
of
negroes
and
colored
men
to
exchange
only
those
excepted
from
amnesty
and
pardon
by
president
johnson
embracing
some
two
millions
or
more
the
very
pars
sanior
of
the
southern
population
for
what
would
remain
or
flock
in
to
supply
their
place
would
be
only
the
exchange
of
glaucus
and
diomed
gold
for
brass
to
disfranchise
them
confiscate
their
estates
and
place
them
under
the
political
control
of
the
freedmen
lately
their
slaves
and
the
ignorant
and
miserable
white
trash
would
be
simply
to
render
rebellion
chronic
and
to
convert
seven
millions
of
americans
willing
and
anxious
to
be
free
loyal
american
citizens
eternal
enemies
they
have
yielded
to
superior
numbers
and
resources
beaten
but
not
disgraced
for
they
have
even
in
rebellion
proved
themselves
what
they
are
real
americans
they
are
the
product
of
the
american
soil
the
free
growth
of
the
american
republic
and
to
disgrace
them
were
to
disgrace
the
whole
american
character
and
people
the
wise
romans
never
allowed
a
triumph
to
a
roman
general
for
victories
however
brilliant
won
over
romans
in
civil
war
the
victory
won
by
the
government
troops
is
held
to
be
a
victory
for
the
country
in
which
all
parties
are
victors
and
nobody
is
vanquished
it
was
as
truly
for
the
good
of
the
secessionists
to
fail
as
it
was
for
those
who
sustained
the
government
to
succeed
and
the
government
having
forced
their
submission
and
vindicated
its
own
authority
it
should
now
leave
them
to
enjoy
with
others
the
victory
which
it
his
won
for
the
common
good
of
all
when
war
becomes
a
stern
necessity
when
it
breaks
out
and
while
it
lasts
humanity
requires
it
to
be
waged
in
earnest
prosecuted
with
vigor
and
made
as
damaging
as
distressful
to
the
enemy
as
the
laws
of
civilized
nations
permit
it
is
the
way
to
bring
it
to
a
speedy
close
and
to
save
life
and
property
but
when
it
is
over
when
the
enemy
submits
and
peace
returns
the
vanquished
should
be
treated
with
gentleness
and
love
no
rancor
should
remain
no
vengeance
should
be
sought
they
who
met
in
mortal
conflict
on
the
should
be
no
longer
enemies
but
embrace
as
comrades
as
friends
as
brothers
none
but
a
coward
kicks
a
fallen
foe
a
brave
people
is
generous
and
the
victors
in
the
late
war
can
afford
to
be
generous
generously
they
fought
for
the
union
and
the
union
has
no
longer
an
enemy
their
late
enemies
are
willing
and
proud
to
be
their
countrymen
and
friends
and
they
should
look
to
it
that
small
politicians
do
not
rob
them
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
by
unnecessary
and
severity
to
the
submissive
of
the
glory
of
being
as
they
are
a
great
noble
chivalric
generous
and
magnanimous
people
the
government
and
the
small
politicians
who
usually
are
the
most
influential
with
all
governments
should
remember
that
none
of
the
secessionists
however
much
in
error
they
have
been
have
committed
the
moral
crime
of
treason
they
held
with
the
majority
of
the
american
people
the
doctrine
of
state
sovereignty
and
on
that
doctrine
they
had
a
right
to
secede
and
have
committed
no
treason
been
guilty
of
no
rebellion
that
was
indeed
no
reason
why
the
government
should
not
use
all
its
force
if
necessary
to
preserve
the
national
unity
and
the
integrity
of
the
national
domain
but
it
is
a
reason
and
a
sufficient
reason
why
no
penalty
of
treason
should
be
inflicted
on
secessionists
or
their
leaders
after
their
submission
and
recognition
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
as
that
to
which
they
owe
allegiance
none
of
the
secessionists
have
been
rebels
or
traitors
except
in
outward
act
and
there
can
after
the
act
has
ceased
be
no
just
punishment
where
there
has
been
no
criminal
intent
treason
is
the
highest
crime
and
deserves
exemplary
punishment
but
not
where
there
has
been
no
treasonable
intent
where
they
who
committed
it
did
not
believe
it
was
treason
and
on
principles
held
by
the
majority
of
their
countrymen
and
by
the
party
that
had
generally
held
the
government
there
really
was
no
treason
concede
state
sovereignty
and
jefferson
davis
was
no
traitor
in
the
war
he
made
on
the
united
states
for
he
made
none
till
his
state
had
seceded
he
could
not
then
be
arraigned
for
his
acts
after
secession
and
at
most
only
for
conspiracy
if
at
all
before
secession
but
if
you
permit
all
to
vote
in
the
of
the
state
who
under
the
old
electoral
law
have
the
elective
franchise
you
throw
the
state
into
the
hands
of
those
who
have
been
disloyal
to
the
union
if
so
and
you
can
not
trust
them
the
remedy
is
not
in
disfranchising
the
majority
but
in
prohibiting
and
in
holding
the
territorial
people
still
longer
under
the
provisional
government
civil
or
military
the
old
electoral
law
disqualifies
all
who
have
been
convicted
of
treason
either
to
the
state
or
the
united
states
and
neither
congress
nor
the
executive
can
declare
any
others
disqualified
on
account
of
disloyalty
but
you
must
throw
the
state
into
the
hands
of
those
who
took
part
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
rebellion
if
you
reconstruct
the
states
at
all
for
they
are
undeniably
the
great
body
of
the
territorial
people
in
all
the
states
that
seceded
these
people
having
submitted
and
declared
their
intention
to
reconstruct
the
state
as
a
state
in
the
union
you
must
amend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
unless
they
are
convicted
of
a
disqualifying
crime
by
due
process
of
law
before
you
can
disfranchise
them
it
is
impossible
to
reconstruct
any
one
of
the
disorganized
states
with
those
alone
or
as
the
dominant
party
who
have
adhered
to
the
union
throughout
the
fearful
struggle
as
states
the
state
resting
on
so
small
a
portion
of
the
people
would
have
no
internal
strength
no
and
could
stand
only
as
upheld
by
federal
arms
which
would
greatly
impair
the
free
and
healthy
action
of
the
whole
american
system
the
government
attempted
to
do
it
in
virginia
louisiana
arkansas
and
tennessee
before
the
rebellion
was
suppressed
but
without
authority
and
without
success
the
organizations
effected
at
great
expense
and
sustained
only
by
military
force
were
neither
states
nor
state
governments
nor
capable
of
being
made
so
by
any
executive
or
congressional
action
if
the
disorganized
states
as
the
government
held
were
still
states
in
the
union
these
organizations
were
flagrantly
revolutionary
as
effected
not
only
without
but
in
defiance
of
state
authority
if
they
had
seceded
and
ceased
to
be
states
as
was
the
fact
they
were
equally
unconstitutional
and
void
of
authority
because
not
created
by
the
free
suffrage
of
the
territorial
people
who
alone
are
competent
to
construct
or
reconstruct
a
state
if
the
unionists
had
retained
the
state
organization
and
government
however
small
their
number
they
would
have
held
the
state
and
the
government
would
have
been
bound
to
recognize
and
to
defend
them
as
such
with
all
the
force
of
the
union
the
rebellion
would
then
have
been
personal
not
territorial
but
such
was
not
the
case
the
state
organization
the
state
government
the
whole
state
authority
rebelled
made
the
rebellion
territorial
not
personal
and
left
the
unionists
very
respectable
persons
assuredly
residing
if
they
remained
at
home
in
rebel
territory
traitors
in
the
eye
of
their
respective
states
and
shorn
of
all
political
status
or
rights
their
political
status
was
simply
that
of
the
old
loyalists
or
adherents
of
the
british
crown
in
the
american
war
for
independence
and
it
was
as
absurd
to
call
them
the
state
as
it
would
have
been
for
great
britain
to
have
called
the
old
tories
the
colonies
the
theory
on
which
the
government
attempted
to
the
disorganized
states
rested
on
two
false
assumptions
first
that
the
people
are
personally
sovereign
and
second
that
all
the
power
of
the
union
vests
in
the
general
government
the
first
as
we
have
seen
is
the
principle
of
squatter
sovereignty
embodied
in
the
famous
bill
which
gave
birth
in
opposition
to
the
republican
party
of
the
people
are
sovereign
only
as
the
state
and
the
state
is
inseparable
from
the
domain
the
unionists
without
the
state
government
without
any
state
organization
could
not
hold
the
domain
which
when
the
state
organization
is
gone
escheats
to
the
united
states
that
is
to
say
ceases
to
exist
the
american
democracy
is
territorial
not
personal
the
general
government
in
time
of
war
or
rebellion
is
indeed
invested
for
war
purposes
with
all
the
power
of
the
union
this
is
the
war
power
but
though
apparently
unlimited
the
war
power
is
yet
restricted
to
war
purposes
and
expires
by
natural
limitation
when
peace
returns
and
peace
returns
in
a
civil
war
when
the
rebels
have
thrown
down
their
arms
and
submitted
to
the
national
authority
and
without
any
formal
declaration
during
the
war
or
while
the
rebellion
lasts
it
can
suspend
the
civil
courts
the
civil
laws
the
state
constitutions
any
thing
necessary
to
the
success
of
the
war
and
of
the
necessity
the
military
authorities
are
the
judges
but
it
can
not
abolish
abrogate
or
reconstitute
them
on
the
return
of
peace
they
revive
of
themselves
in
all
their
vigor
the
emancipation
proclamation
of
the
president
if
it
emancipated
the
slaves
in
certain
states
and
parts
of
states
and
if
those
whom
it
emancipated
could
not
be
did
not
anywhere
abolish
slavery
or
change
the
laws
authorizing
it
and
if
the
government
should
be
sustained
by
congress
or
by
the
supreme
court
in
counting
the
disorganized
states
as
states
in
the
union
the
legal
status
of
slavery
throughout
the
union
with
the
exception
of
maryland
and
perhaps
missouri
is
what
it
was
before
the
war
the
government
undoubtedly
supposed
in
the
reconstructions
it
attempted
that
it
was
acting
under
the
war
power
but
as
reconstruction
can
never
be
necessary
for
war
purposes
and
as
it
is
in
its
very
nature
a
work
of
peace
incapable
of
being
effected
by
military
force
since
its
validity
depends
entirely
on
its
being
the
free
action
of
the
territorial
people
to
be
reconstructed
the
general
government
had
and
could
have
with
regard
to
it
only
its
ordinary
peace
powers
reconstruction
is
jure
pacis
not
jure
belli
yet
such
illegal
organizations
though
they
are
neither
states
nor
state
governments
and
incapable
of
being
legalized
by
any
action
of
the
executive
or
of
congress
may
nevertheless
be
legalized
by
being
indorsed
or
acquiesced
in
by
the
territorial
people
they
are
wrong
as
are
all
usurpations
they
are
undemocratic
inasmuch
as
they
attempt
to
give
the
minority
the
power
to
rule
the
majority
they
are
dangerous
inasmuch
as
they
place
the
state
in
the
hands
of
a
party
that
can
stand
only
as
supported
by
the
general
government
and
thus
destroy
the
proper
freedom
and
independence
of
the
state
and
open
the
door
to
corruption
tend
to
keep
alive
rancor
and
ill
feeling
and
to
retard
the
period
of
complete
pacification
which
might
be
effected
in
three
months
as
well
as
in
three
years
or
twenty
years
yet
they
can
become
legal
as
other
governments
illegal
in
their
origin
become
legal
with
time
and
popular
acquiescence
the
right
way
is
always
the
shortest
and
easiest
but
when
a
government
must
oftener
follow
than
lead
the
public
it
is
not
always
easy
to
hit
the
right
way
and
still
less
easy
to
take
it
the
general
instincts
of
the
people
are
right
as
to
the
end
to
be
gained
but
seldom
right
as
to
the
means
of
gaining
it
and
politicians
of
the
union
party
as
well
as
of
the
late
secession
party
have
an
eye
in
reconstructing
to
the
future
political
control
of
the
state
when
it
is
reconstructed
the
secessionists
if
permitted
to
retain
their
franchise
would
even
if
they
accepted
abolition
no
doubt
their
respective
states
on
the
basis
of
white
suffrage
and
so
would
the
unionists
if
left
to
themselves
there
is
no
party
at
the
south
prepared
to
adopt
negro
suffrage
and
there
would
be
none
at
the
north
if
the
negroes
constituted
any
considerable
portion
of
the
population
as
the
reconstruction
of
a
state
can
not
be
done
under
the
war
power
the
general
government
can
no
more
enfranchise
than
it
can
disfranchise
any
portion
of
the
territorial
people
and
the
question
of
negro
suffrage
must
be
left
where
the
constitution
leaves
it
to
the
states
severally
each
to
dispose
of
it
for
itself
negro
suffrage
will
no
doubt
come
in
time
as
soon
as
the
freedmen
are
prepared
for
it
and
the
danger
is
that
it
will
be
attempted
too
soon
it
would
be
a
convenience
to
have
the
negro
vote
in
the
reconstruction
of
the
states
disorganized
by
secession
for
it
would
secure
their
with
antislavery
constitutions
and
also
make
sure
of
the
proposed
antislavery
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
but
there
is
no
power
in
congress
to
enfranchise
the
negroes
in
the
states
needing
reconstruction
and
once
assured
of
their
freedom
the
freedmen
would
care
little
for
the
union
of
which
they
understand
nothing
they
would
vote
for
the
most
part
with
their
former
masters
their
employers
the
wealthier
and
more
intelligent
classes
whether
loyal
or
disloyal
for
as
a
rule
these
will
treat
them
with
greater
personal
consideration
and
kindness
than
others
the
dislike
of
the
negro
and
hostility
to
negro
equality
increase
as
you
descend
in
the
social
scale
the
freedmen
without
political
instruction
or
experience
who
have
had
no
country
no
domicile
understand
nothing
of
loyalty
or
of
disloyalty
they
have
strong
local
attachments
but
they
can
have
no
patriotism
if
they
adhered
to
the
union
in
the
rebellion
fought
for
it
bled
for
it
it
was
not
from
loyalty
but
because
they
knew
that
their
freedom
could
come
only
from
the
success
of
the
union
arms
that
freedom
secured
they
have
no
longer
any
interest
in
the
union
and
their
local
attachments
personal
associations
habits
tastes
likes
and
dislikes
are
southern
not
northern
in
any
contest
between
the
north
and
the
south
they
would
take
to
a
man
the
southern
side
after
the
taunts
of
the
women
the
captured
soldiers
of
the
union
found
until
nearly
the
last
year
of
the
war
nothing
harder
to
bear
when
marched
as
prisoners
into
richmond
than
the
antics
and
hootings
of
the
negroes
negro
suffrage
on
the
score
of
loyalty
is
at
best
a
matter
of
indifference
to
the
union
and
as
the
elective
franchise
is
not
a
natural
right
but
a
civil
trust
the
friends
of
the
negro
should
for
the
present
be
contented
with
securing
him
simply
equal
rights
of
person
and
property
this
was
the
case
in
august
it
may
be
quite
otherwise

xiv
political
tendencies
the
most
marked
political
tendency
of
the
american
people
has
been
since
to
interpret
their
government
as
a
pure
and
simple
democracy
and
to
shift
it
from
a
territorial
to
a
purely
popular
basis
or
from
the
people
as
the
state
inseparably
united
to
the
national
territory
or
domain
to
the
people
as
simply
population
either
as
individuals
or
as
the
race
their
tendency
has
unconsciously
therefore
been
to
change
their
constitution
from
a
republican
to
a
despotic
or
from
a
civilized
to
a
barbaric
constitution
the
american
constitution
is
democratic
in
the
sense
that
the
people
are
sovereign
that
all
laws
and
public
acts
run
in
their
name
that
the
rulers
are
elected
by
them
and
are
responsible
to
them
but
they
are
the
people
territorially
constituted
and
fixed
to
the
soil
constituting
what
disraeli
with
more
propriety
perhaps
than
he
thinks
calls
a
territorial
democracy
to
this
territorial
democracy
the
real
american
democracy
stand
opposed
two
other
democracies
the
one
personal
and
the
other
humanitarian
each
alike
hostile
to
civilization
and
tending
to
destroy
the
state
and
capable
of
sustaining
government
only
on
principles
common
to
all
despotisms
in
every
man
there
is
a
natural
craving
for
personal
freedom
and
unrestrained
action
a
strong
desire
to
be
himself
not
another
to
be
his
own
master
to
go
when
and
where
he
pleases
to
do
what
he
chooses
to
take
what
he
wants
wherever
he
can
find
it
and
to
keep
what
he
takes
it
is
strong
in
all
nomadic
tribes
who
are
at
once
pastoral
and
predatory
and
is
seldom
weak
in
our
bold
too
often
real
border
ruffians
it
takes
different
forms
in
different
stages
of
social
development
but
it
everywhere
identifies
liberty
with
power
restricted
in
its
enjoyment
to
one
man
it
makes
him
chief
chief
of
the
family
the
tribe
or
the
nation
extended
in
its
enjoyment
to
the
few
it
founds
an
aristocracy
creates
a
nobility
for
nobleman
meant
originally
only
freeman
as
it
does
his
own
consent
express
or
constructive
this
is
the
jeffersonian
democracy
in
which
government
has
no
powers
but
such
as
it
derives
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
and
is
personal
democracy
or
pure
individualism
philosophically
considered
pure
egoism
which
says
i
am
god
under
this
sort
of
democracy
based
on
popular
or
rather
individual
sovereignty
expressed
by
politicians
when
they
call
the
electoral
people
half
seriously
half
mockingly
the
sovereigns
there
obviously
can
be
no
state
no
social
rights
or
civil
authority
there
can
be
only
a
voluntary
association
league
alliance
or
confederation
in
which
individuals
may
freely
act
together
as
long
as
they
find
it
pleasant
convenient
or
useful
but
from
which
they
may
separate
or
secede
whenever
they
find
it
for
their
interest
or
their
pleasure
to
do
so
state
sovereignty
and
secession
are
based
on
the
same
democratic
principle
applied
to
the
several
states
of
the
union
instead
of
individuals
the
tendency
to
this
sort
of
democracy
has
been
strong
in
large
sections
of
the
american
people
from
the
first
and
has
been
greatly
strengthened
by
the
general
acceptance
of
the
theory
that
government
originates
in
compact
the
full
realization
of
this
tendency
which
happily
is
impracticable
save
in
theory
would
be
to
render
every
man
independent
alike
of
every
other
man
and
of
society
with
full
right
and
power
to
make
his
own
will
prevail
this
tendency
was
strongest
in
the
slaveholding
states
and
especially
in
those
states
in
the
slaveholding
class
the
american
imitation
of
the
feudal
nobility
of
mediaeval
europe
and
on
this
side
the
war
just
ended
was
in
its
most
general
expression
a
war
in
defence
of
personal
democracy
or
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
individually
against
the
humanitarian
democracy
represented
by
the
abolitionists
and
the
territorial
democracy
represented
by
the
government
this
personal
democracy
has
been
signally
defeated
in
the
defeat
of
the
late
confederacy
and
can
hardly
again
become
strong
enough
to
be
dangerous
but
the
humanitarian
democracy
which
scorns
all
geographical
lines
effaces
all
in
individualities
and
professes
to
plant
itself
on
humanity
alone
has
acquired
by
the
war
new
strength
and
is
not
without
menace
to
our
future
the
solidarity
of
the
race
which
is
the
condition
of
all
human
life
founds
as
we
have
seen
society
and
creates
what
are
called
social
rights
the
rights
alike
of
society
in
regard
to
individuals
and
of
individuals
in
regard
to
society
territorial
divisions
or
circumscriptions
found
particular
societies
states
or
nations
yet
as
the
race
is
one
and
all
its
members
live
by
communion
with
god
through
it
and
by
communion
one
with
another
these
particular
states
or
nations
are
never
absolutely
independent
of
each
other
but
bound
together
by
the
solidarity
of
the
race
so
that
there
is
a
real
solidarity
of
nations
as
well
as
of
individuals
the
truth
underlying
kossuth
famous
declaration
of
the
solidarity
of
peoples
the
solidarity
of
nations
is
the
basis
of
international
law
binding
on
every
particular
nation
and
which
every
civilized
nation
recognizes
and
enforces
on
its
own
subjects
or
citizens
through
its
own
courts
as
an
integral
part
of
its
own
municipal
or
national
law
the
personal
or
individual
right
is
therefore
restricted
by
the
rights
of
society
and
the
rights
of
the
particular
society
or
nation
are
limited
by
international
law
or
the
rights
of
universal
society
the
truth
the
of
hungary
overlooked
the
grand
error
of
gentilism
was
in
denying
the
unity
and
therefore
the
solidarity
of
the
race
involved
in
its
denial
or
misconception
of
the
unity
of
god
it
therefore
was
never
able
to
assign
any
solid
basis
to
international
law
and
gave
it
only
a
conventional
or
customary
authority
thus
leaving
the
jus
gentium
which
it
recognized
in
deed
without
any
real
foundation
in
the
constitution
of
things
or
authority
in
the
real
world
its
real
basis
is
in
the
solidarity
of
the
race
which
has
its
basis
in
the
unity
of
god
not
the
dead
or
abstract
unity
asserted
by
the
old
eleatics
the
or
the
modern
unitarians
but
the
living
unity
consisting
in
the
threefold
relation
in
the
divine
essence
of
father
son
and
holy
ghost
as
asserted
by
christian
revelation
and
believed
more
or
less
intelligently
by
all
christendom
the
tendency
in
the
southern
states
has
been
to
overlook
the
social
basis
of
the
state
or
the
rights
of
society
founded
on
the
solidarity
of
the
race
and
to
make
all
rights
and
powers
personal
or
individual
and
as
only
the
white
race
has
been
able
to
assert
and
maintain
its
personal
freedom
only
men
of
that
race
are
held
to
have
the
right
to
be
free
hence
the
people
of
those
states
felt
no
scruple
in
holding
the
black
or
colored
race
as
slaves
liberty
said
they
is
the
right
only
of
those
who
have
the
ability
to
assert
and
maintain
it
let
the
negro
prove
that
he
has
this
ability
by
asserting
and
maintaining
his
freedom
and
he
will
prove
his
right
to
be
free
and
that
it
is
a
gross
outrage
a
manifest
injustice
to
enslave
him
but
till
then
let
him
be
my
servant
which
is
best
for
him
and
for
me
why
ask
me
to
free
him
i
shall
by
doing
so
only
change
the
form
of
his
servitude
why
appeal
to
me
am
i
my
brother
keeper
nay
is
he
my
brother
is
this
negro
more
like
an
ape
or
a
baboon
than
a
human
being
of
the
same
race
with
myself
i
believe
it
not
but
in
some
instances
at
least
my
dear
slaveholder
your
slave
is
literally
your
brother
and
sometimes
even
your
son
born
of
your
own
daughter
the
tendency
of
the
southern
democrat
was
to
deny
the
unity
of
the
race
as
well
as
all
obligations
of
society
to
protect
the
weak
and
helpless
and
therefore
all
true
civil
society
at
the
north
there
has
been
and
is
even
yet
an
opposite
tendency
a
tendency
to
exaggerate
the
social
element
to
overlook
the
territorial
basis
of
the
state
and
to
disregard
the
rights
of
individuals
this
tendency
has
been
and
is
strong
in
the
people
called
abolitionists
the
american
abolitionist
is
so
engrossed
with
the
unity
that
he
loses
the
solidarity
of
the
race
which
supposes
unity
of
race
and
multiplicity
of
individuals
and
falls
to
see
any
thing
legitimate
and
authoritative
in
geographical
divisions
or
territorial
circumscriptions
back
of
these
back
of
individuals
he
sees
humanity
superior
to
individuals
superior
to
states
governments
and
laws
and
holds
that
he
may
trample
on
them
all
or
give
them
to
the
winds
at
the
call
of
humanity
or
the
higher
law
the
principle
on
which
he
acts
is
as
indefensible
as
the
personal
or
egoistical
democracy
of
the
slaveholders
and
their
sympathizers
were
his
socialistic
tendency
to
become
exclusive
and
realized
it
would
found
in
the
name
of
humanity
a
complete
social
despotism
which
proving
impracticable
from
its
very
generality
would
break
up
in
anarchy
in
which
might
makes
right
as
in
the
slaveholder
democracy
the
abolitionists
in
supporting
themselves
on
humanity
in
its
generality
regardless
of
individual
and
territorial
rights
can
recognize
no
state
no
civil
authority
and
therefore
are
as
much
out
of
the
order
of
civilization
and
as
much
in
that
of
barbarism
as
is
the
slaveholder
himself
wendell
phillips
is
as
far
removed
from
true
christian
civilization
as
was
john
calhoun
and
william
lloyd
garrison
is
as
much
of
a
barbarian
and
despot
in
principle
and
tendency
as
jefferson
davis
hence
the
great
body
of
the
people
in
the
states
wedded
to
american
democracy
as
they
were
and
are
could
never
as
much
as
they
detested
slavery
be
induced
to
make
common
cause
with
the
abolitionists
and
their
apparent
union
in
the
late
civil
war
was
accidental
simply
owing
to
the
fact
that
for
the
time
the
social
democracy
and
the
territorial
coincides
or
had
the
same
enemy
the
great
body
of
the
loyal
people
instinctively
felt
that
pure
socialism
is
as
incompatible
with
american
democracy
as
pure
individualism
and
the
abolitionists
are
well
aware
that
slavery
has
been
abolished
not
for
humanitarian
or
socialistic
reasons
but
really
for
reasons
of
state
in
order
to
save
the
territorial
democracy
the
territorial
democracy
would
not
unite
to
eliminate
even
so
barbaric
an
element
as
slavery
till
the
rebellion
gave
them
the
constitutional
right
to
abolish
it
and
even
then
so
scrupulous
were
they
that
they
demanded
a
constitutional
amendment
so
as
to
be
able
to
make
clean
work
of
it
without
any
blow
to
individual
or
state
rights
the
abolitionists
were
right
in
opposing
slavery
but
not
in
demanding
its
abolition
on
humanitarian
or
socialistic
grounds
slavery
is
really
a
barbaric
element
and
is
in
direct
antagonism
to
american
civilization
the
whole
force
of
the
national
life
opposes
it
and
must
finally
eliminate
it
or
become
itself
extinct
and
it
is
no
mean
proof
of
their
utter
want
of
sympathy
with
all
the
living
forces
of
modern
civilization
that
the
leading
men
of
the
south
and
their
prominent
friends
at
the
north
really
persuaded
themselves
that
with
cotton
rice
and
tobacco
they
could
effectually
resist
the
movement
and
perpetuate
their
barbaric
democracy
they
studied
the
classics
they
admired
greece
and
rome
and
imagined
that
those
nations
became
great
by
slavery
instead
of
being
great
even
in
spite
of
slavery
they
failed
to
take
into
the
account
the
fact
that
when
greece
and
rome
were
in
the
zenith
of
their
glory
all
contemporary
nations
were
also
slaveholding
nations
and
that
if
they
were
the
greatest
and
most
highly
civilized
nations
of
their
times
they
were
not
fitted
to
be
the
greatest
and
most
highly
civilized
nations
of
all
times
they
failed
also
to
perceive
that
if
the
republic
did
not
include
the
whole
territorial
people
in
the
political
people
it
yet
recognized
both
the
social
and
the
territorial
foundation
of
the
state
and
never
attempted
to
rest
it
on
pure
individualism
they
forgot
too
that
greece
and
rome
both
fell
and
fell
precisely
through
internal
weakness
caused
by
the
barbarism
within
not
through
the
force
of
the
barbarism
beyond
their
frontiers
the
world
has
changed
since
the
time
when
ten
thousand
of
his
slaves
were
sacrificed
as
a
religious
offering
to
the
manes
of
a
single
roman
master
the
infusion
of
the
christian
dogma
of
the
unity
and
solidarity
of
the
race
into
the
belief
the
life
the
laws
the
jurisprudence
of
all
civilized
nations
has
doomed
slavery
and
every
species
of
barbarism
but
this
our
slaveholding
countrymen
saw
not
it
rarely
happens
that
in
any
controversy
individual
or
national
the
real
issue
is
distinctly
presented
or
the
precise
question
in
debate
is
clearly
and
distinctly
understood
by
either
party
slavery
was
only
incidentally
involved
in
the
late
war
the
war
was
occasioned
by
the
collision
of
two
extreme
parties
but
it
was
itself
a
war
between
civilization
and
barbarism
primarily
between
the
territorial
democracy
and
the
personal
democracy
and
in
reality
on
the
part
of
the
nation
as
much
a
war
against
the
socialism
of
the
abolitionist
as
against
the
individualism
of
the
slaveholder
yet
the
victory
though
complete
over
the
former
is
only
half
won
over
the
latter
for
it
has
left
the
humanitarian
democracy
standing
and
perhaps
for
the
moment
stronger
than
ever
the
socialistic
democracy
was
enlisted
by
the
territorial
not
to
strengthen
the
government
at
home
as
it
imagines
for
that
it
did
not
do
and
could
not
do
since
the
national
instinct
was
even
more
opposed
to
it
than
to
the
personal
democracy
but
under
its
antislavery
aspect
to
soften
the
hostility
of
foreign
powers
and
ward
off
foreign
intervention
which
was
seriously
threatened
the
populations
of
europe
especially
of
france
and
england
were
decidedly
and
if
the
war
here
appeared
to
them
a
war
not
solely
for
the
unity
of
the
nation
and
the
integrity
of
its
domain
as
it
really
was
in
which
they
took
and
could
take
no
interest
but
a
war
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
their
governments
would
not
venture
to
intervene
this
was
the
only
consideration
that
weighed
with
lincoln
as
he
himself
assured
the
author
and
induced
him
to
issue
his
emancipation
proclamation
and
europe
rejoices
in
our
victory
over
the
rebellion
only
so
far
as
it
has
liberated
the
slaves
and
honors
the
late
president
only
as
their
supposed
liberator
not
as
the
preserver
of
the
unity
and
integrity
of
the
nation
this
is
natural
enough
abroad
and
proves
the
wisdom
of
the
policy
of
the
government
which
had
become
absolutely
necessary
to
save
the
republic
long
before
it
was
adopted
yet
it
is
not
as
the
emancipator
of
some
two
or
three
millions
of
slaves
that
the
american
patriot
cherishes
the
memory
of
abraham
lincoln
but
aided
by
the
loyal
people
generals
of
rare
merit
and
troops
of
unsurpassed
bravery
and
endurance
as
the
saviour
of
the
american
state
and
the
protector
of
modern
civilization
his
policy
served
this
end
and
therefore
was
wise
but
he
adopted
it
with
the
greatest
possible
reluctance
there
were
greater
issues
in
the
late
war
than
negro
slavery
or
negro
freedom
that
was
only
an
incidental
issue
as
the
really
great
men
of
the
confederacy
felt
who
to
save
their
cause
were
willing
themselves
at
last
to
free
and
arm
their
own
negroes
and
perhaps
were
willing
to
do
it
even
at
first
this
fact
alone
proves
that
they
had
or
believed
they
had
a
far
more
important
cause
than
the
preservation
of
negro
slavery
they
fought
for
personal
democracy
under
the
form
of
state
sovereignty
against
social
democracy
for
personal
freedom
and
independence
against
social
or
humanitarian
despotism
and
so
far
their
cause
was
as
good
as
that
against
which
they
took
up
arms
and
if
they
had
or
could
have
fought
against
that
without
fighting
at
the
same
time
against
the
territorial
the
real
american
the
only
civilized
democracy
they
would
have
succeeded
it
is
not
socialism
nor
abolitionism
that
has
won
nor
is
it
the
north
that
has
conquered
the
union
itself
has
won
no
victories
over
the
south
and
it
is
both
historically
and
legally
false
to
say
that
the
south
has
been
subjugated
the
union
has
preserved
itself
and
american
civilization
alike
for
north
and
south
east
and
west
the
armies
that
so
often
met
in
the
shock
of
battle
were
not
drawn
up
respectively
by
the
north
and
the
south
but
by
two
rival
democracies
to
decide
which
of
the
two
should
rule
the
future
they
were
the
armies
of
two
mutually
antagonistic
systems
and
neither
army
was
clearly
and
distinctly
conscious
of
the
cause
for
which
it
was
shedding
its
blood
each
obeyed
instinctively
a
power
stronger
than
itself
and
which
at
best
it
but
dimly
discerned
on
both
sides
the
cause
was
broader
and
deeper
than
negro
slavery
and
neither
the
proslavery
men
nor
the
abolitionists
have
won
the
territorial
democracy
alone
has
won
and
won
what
will
prove
to
be
a
final
victory
over
the
purely
personal
democracy
which
had
its
chief
seat
in
the
southern
states
though
by
no
means
confined
to
them
the
danger
to
american
democracy
from
that
quarter
is
forever
removed
and
democracy
à
la
rousseau
has
received
a
terrible
defeat
throughout
the
world
though
as
yet
it
is
far
from
being
aware
of
it
but
in
this
world
victories
are
never
complete
the
socialistic
democracy
claims
the
victory
which
has
been
really
won
by
the
territorial
democracy
as
if
it
had
been
socialism
not
patriotism
that
fired
the
hearts
and
nerved
the
arms
of
the
brave
men
led
by
mcclellan
grant
and
sherman
the
humanitarians
are
more
dangerous
in
principle
than
the
egoists
for
they
have
the
appearance
of
building
on
a
broader
and
deeper
foundation
of
being
more
christian
more
philosophic
more
generous
and
philanthropic
but
satan
is
never
more
successful
than
under
the
guise
of
an
angel
of
light
his
favorite
guise
in
modern
times
is
that
of
philanthropy
he
is
a
genuine
humanitarian
and
aims
to
persuade
the
world
that
humanitarianism
is
christianity
and
that
man
is
god
that
the
soft
and
charming
sentiment
of
philanthropy
is
real
christian
charity
and
he
dupes
both
individuals
and
nations
and
makes
them
do
his
work
when
they
believe
they
are
earnestly
and
most
successfully
doing
the
work
of
god
your
leading
abolitionists
are
as
much
affected
by
satanophany
as
your
leading
confederates
nor
are
they
one
whit
more
philosophical
or
less
sophistical
the
one
loses
the
race
the
other
the
individual
and
neither
has
learned
to
apply
practically
that
fundamental
truth
that
there
is
never
the
general
without
the
particular
nor
the
particular
without
the
general
the
race
without
individuals
nor
individuals
without
the
race
the
whole
race
was
in
adam
and
fell
in
him
as
we
are
taught
by
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
or
the
sin
of
the
race
and
adam
was
an
individual
as
we
are
taught
in
the
fact
that
original
sin
was
in
him
actual
or
personal
sin
the
humanitarian
is
carried
away
by
a
vague
generality
and
loses
men
in
humanity
sacrifices
the
rights
of
men
in
a
vain
endeavor
to
secure
the
rights
of
man
as
your
calvinist
or
his
brother
jansenist
sacrifices
the
rights
of
nature
in
order
to
secure
the
freedom
of
grace
yesterday
he
agitated
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
he
agitates
for
negro
suffrage
negro
equality
and
announces
that
when
he
has
secured
that
he
will
agitate
for
female
suffrage
and
the
equality
of
the
sexes
forgetting
or
ignorant
that
the
relation
of
equality
subsists
only
between
individuals
of
the
same
sex
that
god
made
the
man
the
head
of
the
woman
and
the
woman
for
the
man
not
the
man
for
the
woman
having
obliterated
all
distinction
of
sex
in
politics
in
social
industrial
and
domestic
arrangements
he
must
go
farther
and
agitate
for
equality
of
property
but
since
property
if
recognized
at
all
will
be
unequally
acquired
and
distributed
he
must
go
farther
still
and
agitate
for
the
total
abolition
of
property
as
an
injustice
a
grievous
wrong
a
theft
with
proudhon
or
the
englishman
godwin
it
is
unjust
that
one
should
have
what
another
wants
or
even
more
than
another
what
right
have
you
to
ride
in
your
coach
or
astride
your
spirited
barb
while
i
am
forced
to
trudge
on
foot
nor
can
our
humanitarian
stop
there
individuals
are
and
as
long
as
there
are
individuals
will
be
unequal
some
are
handsomer
and
some
are
uglier
some
wiser
or
sillier
more
or
less
gifted
stronger
or
weaker
taller
or
shorter
stouter
or
thinner
than
others
and
therefore
some
have
natural
advantages
which
others
have
not
there
is
inequality
therefore
injustice
which
can
be
remedied
only
by
the
abolition
of
all
individualities
and
the
reduction
of
all
individuals
to
the
race
or
humanity
man
in
general
he
can
find
no
limit
to
his
agitation
this
side
of
vague
generality
which
is
no
reality
but
a
pure
nullity
for
he
respects
no
territorial
or
individual
circumscriptions
and
must
regard
creation
itself
as
a
blunder
this
is
not
fancy
for
he
has
gone
very
nearly
as
far
as
it
is
here
shown
if
logical
he
must
go
the
danger
now
is
that
the
union
victory
will
at
home
and
abroad
be
interpreted
as
a
victory
won
in
the
interest
of
social
or
humanitarian
democracy
it
was
because
they
regarded
the
war
waged
on
the
side
of
the
union
as
waged
in
the
interest
of
this
terrible
democracy
that
our
bishops
and
clergy
sympathized
so
little
with
the
government
in
prosecuting
it
not
as
some
imagined
because
they
were
disloyal
hostile
to
american
or
territorial
democracy
or
not
heartily
in
favor
of
freedom
for
all
men
whatever
their
race
or
complexion
they
had
no
wish
to
see
slavery
prolonged
the
evils
of
which
they
better
than
any
other
class
of
men
knew
and
more
deeply
deplored
none
would
have
regretted
more
than
they
to
have
seen
the
union
broken
up
but
they
held
the
socialistic
or
humanitarian
democracy
represented
by
northern
abolitionists
as
hostile
alike
to
the
church
and
to
civilization
for
the
same
reason
that
they
were
backward
or
reserved
in
their
sympathy
all
the
humanitarian
sects
at
home
and
abroad
were
forward
and
even
ostentatious
in
theirs
the
catholics
feared
the
war
might
result
in
encouraging
la
republiques
democratique
et
sociale
the
humanitarian
sects
trusted
that
it
would
if
the
victory
of
the
union
should
turn
out
to
be
a
victory
for
the
humanitarian
democracy
the
civilized
world
will
have
no
reason
to
applaud
it
that
there
is
some
danger
that
for
a
time
the
victory
will
be
taken
as
a
victory
for
humanitarianism
or
socialism
it
would
be
idle
to
deny
it
is
so
taken
now
and
the
humanitarian
party
throughout
the
world
are
in
ecstasies
over
it
the
party
claim
it
the
european
socialists
and
red
republicans
applaud
it
and
the
mazzinis
and
the
garibaldis
inflict
on
us
the
deep
humiliation
of
their
congratulations
a
cause
that
can
be
approved
by
the
revolutionary
leaders
of
european
liberals
must
be
strangely
misunderstood
or
have
in
it
some
infamous
element
it
is
no
compliment
to
a
nation
to
receive
the
congratulations
of
men
who
assert
not
only
but
and
those
americans
who
are
delighted
with
them
are
worse
enemies
to
the
american
democracy
than
ever
were
jefferson
davis
and
his
fellow
conspirators
and
more
contemptible
as
the
swindler
is
more
contemptible
than
the
highwayman
but
it
is
probable
the
humanitarians
have
reckoned
without
their
host
not
they
are
the
real
victors
when
the
smoke
of
battle
has
cleared
away
the
victory
it
will
be
seen
has
been
won
by
the
republic
and
that
that
alone
has
triumphed
the
abolitionists
in
so
far
as
they
asserted
the
unity
of
the
race
and
opposed
slavery
as
a
denial
of
that
unity
have
also
won
but
in
so
far
as
they
denied
the
reality
or
authority
of
territorial
and
individual
circumscriptions
followed
a
purely
socialistic
tendency
and
sought
to
dissolve
patriotism
into
a
watery
sentimentality
called
philanthropy
have
in
reality
been
crushingly
defeated
as
they
will
find
when
the
late
insurrectionary
states
are
fully
reconstructed
the
southern
or
egoistical
democrats
so
far
as
they
denied
the
unity
and
solidarity
of
the
race
the
rights
of
society
over
individuals
and
the
equal
rights
of
each
and
every
individual
in
face
of
the
state
or
the
obligations
of
society
to
protect
the
weak
and
help
the
helpless
have
been
also
defeated
but
so
far
as
they
asserted
personal
or
individual
rights
which
society
neither
gives
nor
can
take
away
and
so
far
as
they
asserted
not
state
sovereignty
but
state
rights
held
independently
of
the
general
government
and
which
limit
its
authority
and
sphere
of
action
they
share
in
the
victory
as
the
future
will
prove
european
jacobins
revolutionists
conspiring
openly
or
secretly
against
all
legitimate
authority
whether
in
church
or
state
have
no
lot
or
part
in
the
victory
of
the
american
people
not
for
them
nor
for
men
with
their
nefarious
designs
or
mad
dreams
have
our
brave
soldiers
fought
suffered
and
bled
for
four
years
of
the
most
terrible
war
in
modern
times
and
against
troops
as
brave
and
as
well
led
as
themselves
not
for
them
has
the
country
sacrificed
a
million
of
lives
and
contracted
a
debt
of
four
thousand
millions
of
dollars
besides
the
waste
and
destruction
that
it
will
take
years
of
peaceful
industry
to
repair
they
and
their
barbaric
democracy
have
been
defeated
and
civilization
has
won
its
most
brilliant
victory
in
all
history
the
american
democracy
has
crushed
actually
or
potentially
every
species
of
barbarism
in
the
new
world
asserted
victoriously
the
state
and
placed
the
government
definitively
on
the
side
of
legitimate
authority
and
made
its
natural
association
henceforth
with
all
civilized
governments
not
with
the
revolutionary
movements
to
overthrow
them
the
american
people
will
always
be
progressive
as
well
as
conservative
but
they
have
learned
a
lesson
which
they
much
needed
against
false
democracy
civil
war
has
taught
them
that
the
sacred
right
of
insurrection
is
as
much
out
of
place
in
a
democratic
state
as
in
an
aristocratic
or
a
monarchical
state
and
that
the
government
should
always
be
clothed
with
ample
authority
to
arrest
and
punish
whoever
plots
its
destruction
they
must
never
be
delighted
again
to
have
their
government
send
a
national
ship
to
bring
hither
a
noted
traitor
to
his
own
sovereign
as
the
nation
guest
the
people
of
the
northern
states
are
hardly
less
responsible
for
the
late
rebellion
than
the
people
of
the
southern
states
their
press
had
taught
them
to
call
every
government
a
tyranny
that
refused
to
remain
quiet
while
the
traitor
was
cutting
its
throat
or
assassinating
the
nation
and
they
had
nothing
but
mad
denunciations
of
the
papal
the
austrian
and
the
neapolitan
governments
for
their
severity
against
conspirators
and
traitors
but
their
own
government
has
found
it
necessary
for
the
public
safety
to
be
equally
arbitrary
prompt
and
severe
and
they
will
most
likely
require
it
hereafter
to
with
the
governments
of
the
old
world
in
advancing
civilization
instead
of
lending
all
its
moral
support
as
heretofore
to
the
jacobins
revolutionists
socialists
and
humanitarians
to
bring
back
the
reign
of
barbarism
the
tendency
to
individualism
has
been
sufficiently
checked
by
the
failure
of
the
rebellion
and
no
danger
from
the
disintegrating
element
either
in
the
particular
state
or
in
the
united
states
is
henceforth
to
be
apprehended
but
the
tendency
in
the
opposite
direction
may
give
the
american
state
some
trouble
the
tendency
now
is
as
to
the
union
consolidation
and
as
to
the
particular
state
humanitarianism
socialism
or
centralized
democracy
yet
this
tendency
though
it
may
do
much
mischief
will
hardly
become
exclusive
the
states
that
seceded
when
restored
will
always
even
in
abandoning
state
sovereignty
resist
it
and
still
assert
state
rights
when
these
states
are
restored
to
their
normal
position
they
will
always
be
able
to
protect
themselves
against
any
encroachments
on
their
special
rights
by
the
general
government
the
constitution
in
the
distribution
of
the
powers
of
government
provides
the
states
severally
with
ample
means
to
protect
their
individuality
against
the
centralizing
tendency
of
the
general
government
however
strong
it
may
be
the
war
has
no
doubt
had
a
tendency
to
strengthen
the
general
government
and
to
cause
the
people
to
a
great
extent
to
look
upon
it
as
the
supreme
and
exclusive
national
government
and
to
regard
the
several
state
governments
as
subordinate
instead
of
governments
it
is
not
improbable
that
the
executive
since
the
outbreak
of
the
rebellion
has
proceeded
throughout
on
that
supposition
and
hence
his
extraordinary
assumptions
of
power
but
when
once
peace
is
fully
and
the
states
have
all
resumed
their
normal
position
in
the
union
every
state
will
be
found
prompt
enough
to
resist
any
attempt
to
encroach
on
its
constitutional
rights
its
instinct
of
will
lead
it
to
resist
and
it
will
be
protected
by
both
its
own
judiciary
and
that
of
the
united
states
the
danger
that
the
general
government
will
usurp
the
rights
of
the
states
is
far
less
than
the
danger
that
the
executive
will
usurp
all
the
powers
of
congress
and
the
judiciary
congress
during
the
rebellion
clothed
the
president
as
far
as
it
could
with
dictatorial
powers
and
these
powers
the
executive
continues
to
exercise
even
after
the
rebellion
is
suppressed
they
were
given
and
held
under
the
rights
of
war
and
for
war
purposes
only
and
expired
by
natural
limitation
when
the
war
ceased
but
the
executive
forgets
this
and
instead
of
calling
congress
together
and
submitting
the
work
of
reconstruction
of
the
states
that
seceded
to
its
wisdom
and
authority
undertakes
to
reconstruct
them
himself
as
if
he
were
an
absolute
sovereign
and
the
people
seem
to
like
it
he
might
and
should
as
of
the
army
and
navy
govern
them
as
military
departments
by
his
lieutenants
till
congress
could
either
create
provisional
civil
governments
for
them
or
recognize
them
as
states
in
the
union
but
he
has
no
right
under
the
constitution
nor
under
the
war
power
to
appoint
civil
governors
permanent
or
provisional
and
every
act
he
has
done
in
regard
to
reconstruction
is
sheer
usurpation
and
done
without
authority
and
without
the
slightest
plea
of
necessity
his
acts
in
this
respect
even
if
wise
and
just
in
themselves
are
inexcusable
because
done
by
one
who
has
no
legal
right
to
do
them
yet
his
usurpation
is
apparently
sustained
by
public
sentiment
and
a
deep
wound
is
inflicted
on
the
constitution
which
will
be
long
in
healing
the
danger
in
this
respect
is
all
the
greater
because
it
did
not
originate
with
the
rebellion
but
had
manifested
itself
for
a
long
time
before
there
is
a
growing
disposition
on
the
part
of
congress
to
throw
as
much
of
the
business
of
government
as
possible
into
the
hands
of
the
executive
the
patronage
the
executive
wields
even
in
times
of
peace
is
so
large
that
he
has
indirectly
an
almost
supreme
control
over
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
for
this
which
is
and
if
not
checked
will
continue
to
be
a
growing
evil
there
is
no
obvious
remedy
unless
the
president
is
chosen
for
a
longer
term
of
office
and
made
ineligible
for
a
second
term
and
the
mischievous
doctrine
of
rotation
in
office
is
rejected
as
incompatible
with
the
true
interests
of
the
public
here
is
matter
for
the
consideration
of
the
american
statesman
but
as
to
the
usurpations
of
the
executive
in
these
unsettled
times
they
will
be
only
temporary
and
will
cease
when
the
states
are
all
restored
they
are
abuses
but
only
temporary
abuses
and
the
southern
states
when
restored
to
the
union
will
resume
their
rights
in
their
own
sphere
as
communities
and
legalize
or
undo
the
unwarrantable
acts
of
the
federal
executive
the
socialistic
and
centralizing
tendency
in
the
bosom
of
the
individual
states
is
the
most
dangerous
but
it
will
not
be
able
to
become
predominant
for
philanthropy
unlike
charity
does
not
begin
at
home
and
is
powerless
unless
it
operates
at
a
distance
in
the
states
in
which
the
humanitarian
tendency
is
the
strongest
the
territorial
democracy
has
its
most
effective
organization
prior
to
the
outbreak
of
the
rebellion
the
american
people
had
asserted
popular
sovereignty
but
had
never
rendered
an
account
to
themselves
in
what
sense
the
people
are
or
are
not
sovereign
they
had
never
distinguished
the
three
sorts
of
democracy
from
one
another
asked
themselves
which
of
the
three
is
the
distinctively
american
democracy
for
them
democracy
was
democracy
and
those
who
saw
dangers
ahead
sought
to
avoid
them
either
by
exaggerating
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
exclusive
tendencies
or
else
by
restraining
democracy
itself
through
restrictions
on
suffrage
the
latter
class
began
to
distrust
universal
suffrage
to
lose
faith
in
the
people
and
to
dream
of
modifying
the
american
constitution
so
as
to
make
it
conform
more
nearly
to
the
english
model
the
war
has
proved
that
the
were
wrong
for
nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
the
people
have
saved
the
national
unity
and
integrity
almost
in
spite
of
their
government
the
general
government
either
was
not
disposed
or
was
afraid
to
take
a
decided
stand
against
secession
till
forced
to
do
it
by
the
people
themselves
no
wise
american
can
henceforth
distrust
american
democracy
the
people
may
be
trusted
so
much
is
settled
but
as
the
two
extremes
were
equally
democratic
as
the
secessionists
acted
in
the
name
of
popular
sovereignty
and
as
the
humanitarians
were
not
unwilling
to
allow
separation
and
would
not
and
did
not
engage
in
the
war
against
secession
for
the
sake
of
the
union
and
the
integrity
of
the
national
domain
the
conviction
becomes
irresistible
that
it
was
not
democracy
in
the
sense
of
either
of
the
extremes
that
made
the
war
and
came
out
of
it
victorious
and
hence
the
real
american
democracy
must
differ
from
them
both
and
is
neither
a
personal
nor
a
humanitarian
but
a
territorial
democracy
the
true
idea
of
american
democracy
thus
comes
out
for
the
first
time
freed
from
the
two
extreme
democracies
which
have
been
identified
with
it
and
henceforth
enters
into
the
understandings
as
well
as
the
hearts
of
the
people
the
war
has
enlightened
patriotism
and
what
was
sentiment
or
instinct
becomes
reason
a
and
clearly
understood
constitutional
conviction
in
the
several
states
themselves
there
are
many
things
to
prevent
the
socialistic
tendency
from
becoming
exclusive
in
the
states
that
seceded
socialism
has
never
had
a
foothold
and
will
not
gain
it
for
it
is
resisted
by
all
the
sentiments
convictions
and
habits
of
the
southern
people
and
the
southern
people
will
not
be
exterminated
nor
swamped
by
migrations
either
from
the
north
or
from
europe
they
are
and
always
will
be
an
agricultural
people
and
an
agricultural
people
are
and
always
will
be
opposed
to
socialistic
dreams
unless
unwittingly
held
for
a
moment
to
favor
it
in
pursuit
of
some
special
object
in
which
they
take
a
passionate
interest
the
worst
of
all
policies
is
that
of
hanging
exiling
or
disfranchising
the
wealthy
landholders
of
the
south
in
order
to
bring
up
the
poor
and
depressed
whites
shadowed
forth
in
the
executive
proclamation
of
the
of
may
of
course
that
policy
will
not
be
carried
out
and
if
the
negroes
are
enfranchised
they
will
always
vote
with
the
wealthy
landholding
class
and
aid
them
in
resisting
all
socialistic
tendencies
the
humanitarians
will
fail
for
the
want
of
a
good
social
grievance
against
which
they
can
declaim
in
the
new
england
states
the
humanitarian
tendency
is
strong
as
a
speculation
but
only
in
relation
to
objects
at
a
distance
it
is
aided
much
by
the
congregational
constitution
of
their
religion
yet
it
is
weak
at
home
and
is
resisted
practically
by
the
territorial
division
of
power
new
england
means
massachusetts
and
nowhere
is
the
subdivision
of
the
powers
of
government
carried
further
or
the
constitution
of
the
territorial
democracy
more
complete
than
in
that
state
philanthropy
seldom
works
in
private
against
private
vices
and
evils
it
is
effective
only
against
public
grievances
and
the
farther
they
are
from
home
and
the
less
its
right
to
interfere
with
them
the
more
in
earnest
and
the
more
effective
for
evil
does
it
become
its
nature
is
to
mind
every
one
business
but
its
own
but
now
that
slavery
is
abolished
there
is
nowhere
in
the
united
states
a
social
grievance
of
magnitude
enough
to
enlist
any
considerable
number
of
the
people
even
of
massachusetts
in
a
movement
to
redress
it
negro
enfranchisement
is
a
question
of
which
the
humanitarians
can
make
something
and
they
will
make
the
most
of
it
but
as
it
is
a
question
that
each
state
will
soon
settle
for
itself
it
will
not
serve
their
purpose
of
prolonged
agitation
they
could
not
and
never
did
carry
away
the
nation
even
on
the
question
of
slavery
itself
and
abolitionism
had
comparatively
little
direct
influence
in
abolishing
slavery
and
the
exclusion
of
negro
suffrage
can
never
be
made
to
appear
to
the
american
people
as
any
thing
like
so
great
a
grievance
as
was
slavery
besides
in
all
the
states
that
did
not
secede
catholics
are
a
numerous
and
an
important
portion
of
the
population
their
increasing
numbers
wealth
and
education
secure
them
as
much
as
the
majority
may
dislike
their
religion
a
constantly
increasing
influence
and
it
is
idle
to
leave
them
out
in
counting
the
future
of
the
country
they
will
in
a
very
few
years
be
the
best
and
most
thoroughly
educated
class
of
the
american
people
and
aside
from
their
religion
or
rather
in
consequence
of
their
religion
the
most
learned
enlightened
and
intelligent
portion
of
the
american
population
and
as
much
as
they
have
disliked
the
abolitionists
they
have
in
the
army
and
elsewhere
contributed
their
full
share
to
the
victory
the
nation
has
won
the
best
things
written
on
the
controversy
have
been
written
by
catholics
and
catholics
are
better
fitted
by
their
religion
to
comprehend
the
real
character
of
the
american
constitution
than
any
other
class
of
americans
the
moment
they
study
it
in
the
light
of
their
own
theology
the
american
constitution
is
based
on
that
of
natural
society
on
the
solidarity
of
the
race
and
the
difference
between
natural
society
and
the
church
or
christian
society
is
that
the
one
is
initial
and
the
other
teleological
the
law
of
both
is
the
same
catholics
as
such
must
resist
both
extremes
because
each
is
exclusive
and
whatever
is
exclusive
or
is
uncatholic
if
they
have
been
backward
in
their
sympathy
with
the
government
it
has
been
through
their
dislike
of
the
puritanic
spirit
and
the
humanitarian
or
socialistic
elements
they
detected
in
the
republican
party
joined
with
a
prejudice
against
political
and
social
negro
equality
but
their
church
everywhere
opposes
the
socialistic
movements
of
the
age
all
movements
in
behalf
of
barbarism
and
they
may
always
be
counted
on
to
resist
the
advance
of
the
socialistic
democracy
if
the
country
has
had
reason
to
complain
of
some
of
them
in
the
late
war
it
will
have
in
the
future
far
stronger
reason
to
be
grateful
not
to
them
indeed
for
the
citizen
owes
his
life
to
his
country
but
to
their
religion
which
has
been
and
is
the
grand
protectress
of
modern
society
and
civilization
from
the
origin
of
the
government
there
has
been
a
tendency
to
the
extension
of
suffrage
and
to
exclude
both
birth
and
private
property
as
bases
of
political
rights
or
franchises
this
tendency
has
often
been
justified
on
the
ground
that
the
elective
franchise
is
a
natural
right
which
is
not
true
because
the
elective
franchise
is
political
power
and
political
power
is
always
a
civil
trust
never
a
natural
right
and
the
state
judges
for
itself
to
whom
it
will
or
will
not
confide
the
trust
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
is
a
normal
tendency
and
in
strict
accordance
with
the
constitution
of
american
civil
society
which
rests
on
the
unity
of
the
race
and
public
instead
of
private
property
all
political
distinctions
founded
on
birth
race
or
private
wealth
are
anomalies
in
the
american
system
and
are
necessarily
eliminated
by
its
normal
developments
to
contend
that
none
but
may
vote
or
none
but
persons
of
a
particular
race
may
be
enfranchised
is
unamerican
and
contrary
to
the
order
of
civilization
the
new
world
is
developing
the
only
qualification
for
the
elective
franchise
the
american
system
can
logically
insist
on
is
that
the
elector
belong
to
the
territorial
people
that
is
be
a
or
a
naturalized
citizen
be
a
major
in
full
possession
of
his
natural
faculties
and
unconvicted
of
any
infamous
offence
the
state
is
free
to
naturalize
foreigners
or
not
and
under
such
restrictions
as
it
judges
proper
but
having
naturalized
them
it
must
treat
them
as
standing
on
the
same
footing
with
citizens
the
naturalization
question
is
one
of
great
national
importance
the
migration
of
foreigners
hither
has
added
largely
to
the
national
population
and
to
the
national
wealth
and
resources
but
less
perhaps
to
the
development
of
patriotism
the
purity
of
elections
or
the
wisdom
and
integrity
of
the
government
it
is
impossible
that
there
should
be
perfect
harmony
between
the
national
territorial
democracy
and
individuals
born
brought
up
and
formed
under
a
political
order
in
many
respects
widely
different
from
it
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
democracy
in
its
objectionable
sense
has
been
greatly
strengthened
by
the
large
infusion
of
naturalized
citizens
there
can
be
no
question
that
if
the
laboring
classes
in
whom
the
national
sentiment
is
usually
the
strongest
had
been
composed
almost
wholly
of
native
americans
instead
of
being
as
they
were
at
least
in
the
cities
large
towns
and
villages
composed
almost
exclusively
of
persons
foreign
born
the
government
would
have
found
far
less
difficulty
in
filling
up
the
depleted
ranks
of
its
armies
but
to
leave
so
large
a
portion
of
the
actual
population
as
the
foreign
born
residing
in
the
country
without
the
rights
of
citizens
would
have
been
a
far
graver
evil
and
would
in
the
late
struggle
have
given
the
victory
to
secession
there
are
great
national
advantages
derived
from
the
migration
hither
of
foreign
labor
and
if
the
migration
be
encouraged
or
permitted
naturalization
on
easy
and
liberal
terms
is
the
wisest
the
best
and
only
safe
policy
the
children
of
parents
are
real
americans
emigration
has
also
a
singular
effect
in
developing
the
latent
powers
of
the
emigrant
and
the
children
of
emigrants
are
usually
more
active
more
energetic
than
the
children
of
the
older
inhabitants
of
the
country
among
whom
they
settle
some
of
our
first
men
in
civil
life
have
been
sons
of
parents
and
so
are
not
a
few
of
our
greatest
and
most
successful
generals
the
most
successful
of
our
merchants
have
been
the
same
thing
has
been
noticed
elsewhere
especially
in
the
emigration
of
the
french
huguenots
to
holland
germany
england
and
ireland
the
immigration
of
so
many
millions
from
the
old
world
has
no
doubt
given
to
the
american
people
much
of
their
bold
energetic
and
adventurous
character
and
made
them
a
superior
people
on
the
whole
to
what
they
would
otherwise
have
been
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
superiority
or
inferiority
of
race
or
blood
but
is
a
natural
effect
of
breaking
men
away
from
routine
and
throwing
them
back
on
their
own
individual
energies
and
personal
resources
resistance
is
offered
to
negro
suffrage
and
justly
too
till
the
recently
emancipated
slaves
have
served
an
apprenticeship
to
freedom
but
that
resistance
can
not
long
stand
before
the
onward
progress
of
american
democracy
which
asserts
equal
rights
for
all
and
not
for
a
race
or
class
only
some
would
confine
suffrage
to
landholders
or
at
least
to
but
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
american
idea
and
is
a
relic
of
the
barbaric
constitution
which
founds
power
on
private
instead
of
public
wealth
nor
are
a
whit
more
likely
to
vote
for
the
public
good
than
are
those
who
own
no
property
but
their
own
labor
the
men
of
wealth
the
business
men
manufacturers
and
merchants
bankers
and
brokers
are
the
men
who
exert
the
worst
influence
on
government
in
every
country
for
they
always
strive
to
use
it
as
an
instrument
of
advancing
their
own
private
interests
they
act
on
the
beautiful
maxim
let
government
take
care
of
the
rich
and
the
rich
will
take
care
of
the
poor
instead
of
the
far
safer
maxim
let
government
take
care
of
the
weak
the
strong
can
take
care
of
themselves
universal
suffrage
is
better
than
restricted
suffrage
but
even
universal
suffrage
is
too
weak
to
prevent
private
property
from
having
an
undue
political
influence
the
evils
attributed
to
universal
suffrage
are
not
inseparable
from
it
and
after
all
it
is
doubtful
if
it
elevates
men
of
an
inferior
class
to
those
elevated
by
restricted
suffrage
the
congress
of
or
of
was
a
fair
average
of
the
wisdom
the
talent
and
the
virtue
of
the
country
and
not
inferior
to
that
of
or
that
of
and
the
executive
during
the
rebellion
was
at
least
as
able
and
as
efficient
as
it
was
during
the
war
of
far
superior
to
that
of
great
britain
and
not
inferior
to
that
of
france
during
the
crimean
war
the
crimean
war
developed
and
placed
in
high
command
either
with
the
english
or
the
french
no
generals
equal
to
halleck
grant
and
sherman
to
say
nothing
of
others
the
more
aristocratic
south
proved
itself
in
both
statesmanship
and
generalship
in
no
respect
superior
to
the
territorial
democracy
of
the
north
and
west
the
great
evil
the
country
experiences
is
not
from
universal
suffrage
but
from
what
may
be
called
rotation
in
office
the
number
of
political
aspirants
is
so
great
that
in
the
northern
and
western
states
especially
the
representatives
in
congress
are
changed
every
two
or
four
years
and
a
member
as
soon
as
he
has
acquired
the
experience
necessary
to
qualify
him
for
his
position
is
dropped
not
through
the
fickleness
of
his
constituency
but
to
give
place
to
another
whose
aid
had
been
necessary
to
his
first
or
second
election
employes
are
rotated
not
because
they
are
incapable
or
unfaithful
but
because
there
are
others
who
want
their
places
this
is
all
bad
but
it
springs
not
from
universal
suffrage
but
from
a
wrong
public
opinion
which
might
be
corrected
by
the
press
but
which
is
mainly
formed
by
it
there
is
no
doubt
a
due
share
of
official
corruption
but
not
more
than
elsewhere
and
that
would
be
much
diminished
by
increasing
the
salaries
of
the
public
servants
especially
in
the
higher
offices
of
the
government
both
general
and
state
the
pay
to
the
lower
officers
and
employes
of
the
government
and
to
the
privates
and
officers
in
the
army
is
liberal
and
in
general
too
liberal
but
the
pay
of
the
higher
grades
in
both
the
civil
and
military
service
is
too
low
and
relatively
far
lower
than
it
was
when
the
government
was
first
organized
the
worst
tendency
in
the
country
and
which
is
not
encouraged
at
all
by
the
territorial
democracy
manifests
itself
in
hostility
to
the
military
spirit
and
a
standing
army
the
depreciation
of
the
military
spirit
comes
from
the
humanitarian
or
sentimental
democracy
which
like
all
sentimentalisms
defeats
itself
and
brings
about
the
very
evils
it
seeks
to
avoid
the
hostility
to
standing
armies
is
inherited
from
england
and
originated
in
the
quarrels
between
king
and
parliament
and
is
a
striking
evidence
of
the
folly
of
that
bundle
of
antagonistic
forces
called
the
british
constitution
in
feudal
times
most
of
the
land
was
held
by
military
service
and
the
reliance
of
government
was
on
the
feudal
militia
but
no
real
progress
was
made
in
eliminating
barbarism
till
the
national
authority
got
a
regular
army
at
its
command
and
became
able
to
defend
itself
against
its
enemies
it
is
very
doubtful
if
english
civilization
has
not
upon
the
whole
lost
more
than
it
has
gained
by
substituting
parliamentary
for
royal
supremacy
and
exchanging
the
stuarts
for
the
guelfs
no
nation
is
a
living
prosperous
nation
that
has
lost
the
military
spirit
or
in
which
the
profession
of
the
soldier
is
not
held
in
honor
and
esteem
and
a
standing
army
of
reasonable
size
is
public
economy
it
absorbs
in
its
ranks
a
class
of
men
who
are
worth
more
there
than
anywhere
else
it
creates
honorable
places
for
gentlemen
or
the
sons
of
gentlemen
without
wealth
in
which
they
can
serve
both
themselves
and
their
country
under
a
democratic
government
the
most
serious
embarrassment
to
the
state
is
its
gentlemen
or
persons
not
disposed
or
not
fitted
to
support
themselves
by
their
own
hands
more
necessary
in
a
democratic
government
than
in
any
other
the
civil
service
divinity
law
and
medicine
together
with
literature
science
and
art
can
not
absorb
the
whole
of
this
class
and
the
army
and
navy
would
be
an
economy
and
a
real
service
to
the
state
were
they
maintained
only
for
the
sake
of
the
rank
and
position
they
give
to
their
officers
and
the
wholesome
influence
these
officers
would
exert
on
society
and
the
politics
of
the
country
this
even
in
case
there
were
no
wars
or
apprehension
of
wars
they
supply
an
element
needed
in
all
society
to
sustain
in
it
the
chivalric
and
heroic
spirit
perpetually
endangered
by
the
mercantile
and
political
spirit
which
has
in
it
always
something
low
and
sordid
but
wars
are
inevitable
and
when
a
nation
has
no
surrounding
nations
to
fight
it
will
as
we
have
just
proved
fight
itself
when
it
can
have
no
foreign
war
it
will
get
up
a
domestic
war
for
the
human
animal
like
all
animals
must
work
off
in
some
way
its
fighting
humor
and
the
only
sure
way
of
maintaining
peace
is
always
to
be
prepared
for
war
a
regular
standing
army
of
forty
thousand
men
would
have
prevented
the
mexican
war
and
an
army
of
fifty
thousand
and
efficient
troops
at
the
command
of
the
president
on
his
inauguration
in
march
would
have
prevented
the
rebellion
or
have
instantly
suppressed
it
the
cost
of
maintaining
a
land
army
of
even
a
hundred
thousand
men
and
a
naval
force
to
correspond
would
have
been
in
simple
money
value
only
a
tithe
of
what
the
rebellion
has
cost
the
nation
to
say
nothing
of
the
valuable
lives
that
have
been
sacrificed
for
the
losses
on
the
rebel
side
as
well
as
those
on
the
side
of
the
government
are
equally
to
be
counted
the
actual
losses
to
the
country
have
been
not
less
than
six
or
eight
thousand
millions
of
dollars
or
nearly
the
assessed
value
of
the
whole
property
of
the
united
states
according
to
the
census
returns
of
and
which
has
only
been
partially
cancelled
by
actual
increase
of
property
since
to
meet
the
interest
on
the
debt
incurred
will
require
a
heavier
sum
to
be
raised
annually
by
taxation
twice
over
without
discharging
a
cent
of
the
principal
than
would
have
been
necessary
to
maintain
an
army
and
navy
adequate
to
the
protection
of
peace
and
the
prevention
of
the
rebellion
the
rebellion
is
now
suppressed
and
if
the
government
does
not
blunder
much
more
in
its
civil
efforts
at
pacification
than
it
did
in
its
military
operations
before
things
will
settle
down
into
their
normal
order
but
a
regular
army
not
militia
or
volunteers
who
are
too
expensive
of
at
least
a
hundred
thousand
men
of
all
arms
and
a
navy
nearly
as
large
as
that
of
england
or
france
will
be
needed
as
a
peace
establishment
the
army
of
a
hundred
thousand
men
must
form
a
cadre
of
an
army
of
three
times
that
number
which
will
be
necessary
to
place
the
army
on
a
war
footing
less
will
answer
neither
for
peace
nor
war
for
the

in

of
herself
to
maintain
henceforth
the
rank
of

which
the

is
trying
by
strengthening

spain
and
by

to
secure
to

both
in

old

and

a
magnificent
dream
but
not
to

realized
his

sold

left
the

to

and
sought
only
to
secure
to

the
hegemony
of
the
old
but
the
hegemony
of
the
new
world
henceforth
belongs
to
the
united
states
and
she
will
have
a
potent
voice
in
adjusting
the
balance
of
power
even
in
europe
to
maintain
this
position
which
is
imperative
on
her
she
must
always
have
a
large
armed
force
either
on
foot
or
in
reserve
which
she
can
call
out
and
put
on
a
war
footing
at
short
notice
the
united
states
must
henceforth
be
a
great
military
and
naval
power
and
the
old
hostility
to
a
standing
army
and
the
old
attempt
to
bring
the
military
into
disrepute
must
be
abandoned
and
the
country
yield
to
its
destiny
of
the
several
tendencies
mentioned
the
humanitarian
tendency
egoistical
at
the
south
detaching
the
individual
from
the
race
and
socialistic
at
the
north
absorbing
the
individual
in
the
race
is
the
most
dangerous
the
egoistical
form
is
checked
sufficiently
weakened
by
the
defeat
of
the
rebels
but
the
social
form
believes
that
it
has
triumphed
and
that
individuals
are
effaced
in
society
and
the
states
in
the
union
against
this
more
especially
should
public
opinion
and
american
statesmanship
be
now
directed
and
territorial
democracy
and
the
division
of
the
powers
of
government
be
asserted
and
vigorously
maintained
the
danger
is
that
while
this
socialistic
form
of
democracy
is
conscious
of
itself
the
territorial
democracy
has
not
yet
arrived
as
the
germans
say
at
self
consciousness
and
operates
only
instinctively
all
the
dominant
theories
and
sentimentalities
are
against
it
and
it
is
only
providence
that
can
sustain
it
chapter
xv
destiny
political
and
religious
it
has
been
said
in
the
introduction
to
this
essay
that
every
living
nation
receives
from
providence
a
special
work
or
mission
in
the
progress
of
society
to
accomplish
which
is
its
destiny
or
the
end
for
which
it
exists
and
that
the
special
mission
of
the

is
to
continue
and
complete
in
the
political
order
the
civilization
of
all
the
states
or
colonies
on
this
continent
the
american

alone
has
a

to
add

canada
and
the
other
british
provinces
mexico
and
central
america
columbia
and
brazil
and
the
rest
of
the
south
american
states
might
be
absorbed
in
the
united
states
without
being
missed
by
the
civilized
world
they
represent
no
idea
and
the
work
of
civilization
could
go
on
without
them
as
well
as
with
them
if
they
keep
up
with
the
progress
of
civilization
it
is
all
that
can
be
expected
of
them
france
england
germany
and
italy
might
absorb
the
rest
of
europe
and
all
asia
and
africa
without
withdrawing
a
single
laborer
from
the
work
of
advancing
the
civilization
of
the
race
and
it
is
doubtful
if
these
nations
themselves
can
severally
or
jointly
advance
it
much
beyond
the
point
reached
by
the
roman
empire
except
in
abolishing
slavery
and
including
in
the
political
people
the
whole
territorial
people
they
can
only
develop
and
give
a
general
application
to
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
roman
constitution
that
indeed
is
much
but
it
adds
no
new
element
nor
new
combination
of
preexisting
elements
but
nothing
of
this
can
be
said
of
the
united
states
in
the
civilization
is
found
the
state
proper
and
the
great
principle
of
the
territorial
constitution
of
power
instead
of
the
personal
or
the
genealogical
the
patriarchal
or
the
monarchical
and
yet
with
true
civil
or
political
principles
it
mixed
up
nearly
all
the
elements
of
the
barbaric
constitution
the
gentile
system
of
rome
recalls
the
patriarchal
and
the
relation
that
subsisted
between
the
patron
and
his
clients
has
a
striking
resemblance
to
that
which
subsists
between
the
feudal
lord
and
his
retainers
and
may
have
had
the
same
origin
the
three
tribes
ramnes
quirites
and
luceres
into
which
the
roman
people
were
divided
before
the
rise
of
the
plebs
may
have
been
as
niebuhr
contends
local
not
genealogical
in
their
origin
but
they
were
not
strictly
territorial
distinctions
and
the
division
of
each
tribe
into
a
hundred
houses
or
gentes
was
not
local
but
personal
if
not
as
the
name
implies
genealogical
no
doubt
the
individuals
or
families
composing
the
house
or
gens
were
not
all
of
kindred
blood
for
the
oriental
custom
of
adoption
so
frequent
with
our
north
american
indians
and
with
all
people
distributed
into
tribes
septs
or
clans
obtained
with
the
romans
the
adopted
member
was
considered
a
child
of
the
house
and
took
its
name
and
inherited
its
goods
whether
as
niebuhr
maintains
all
the
free
gentiles
of
the
three
tribes
were
called
patres
or
patricians
or
whether
the
term
was
restricted
to
the
heads
of
houses
it
is
certain
that
the
head
of
the
house
represented
it
in
the
senate
and
the
vote
in
the
curies
was
by
houses
not
by
individuals
en
masse
after
all
practically
the
roman
senate
was
hardly
less
an
estate
than
the
english
house
of
lords
for
no
one
could
sit
in
it
unless
a
landed
proprietor
and
of
noble
blood
the
plebs
though
outside
of
the
political
people
proper
as
not
being
included
in
the
three
tribes
when
they
came
to
be
a
power
in
the
republic
under
the
emperors
and
the
old
distinction
of
plebs
and
patricians
was
forgotten
were
an
estate
and
not
a
local
or
territorial
people
the
republican
element
was
in
the
fact
that
the
land
which
gave
the
right
to
participate
in
political
power
was
the
domain
of
the
state
and
the
tenant
held
it
from
the
state
the
domain
was
vested
in
the
state
not
in
the
senator
nor
the
prince
and
was
therefore
respublica
not
private
property
the
first
grand
leap
of
the
human
race
from
barbarism
in
all
other
respects
the
roman
constitution
was
no
more
republican
than
the
feudal
athens
went
farther
than
rome
and
introduced
the
principle
of
territorial
democracy
the
division
into
demes
or
wards
whence
comes
the
word
democracy
was
a
real
territorial
division
not
personal
nor
genealogical
and
if
the
equality
of
all
men
was
not
recognized
all
who
were
included
in
the
political
class
stood
on
the
same
footing
athens
and
other
greek
cities
though
conquered
by
rome
exerted
after
their
conquest
a
powerful
influence
on
roman
civilization
which
became
far
more
democratic
under
the
emperors
than
it
had
been
under
the
patrician
senate
which
the
assassins
of
julius
caesar
and
the
superannuated
conservative
party
they
represented
tried
so
hard
to
preserve
the
senate
and
the
consulship
were
opened
to
the
representatives
of
the
great
plebeian
houses
and
the
provincials
were
clothed
with
the
rights
of
roman
citizens
and
uniform
laws
were
established
throughout
the
empire
the
grand
error
as
has
already
been
said
of
the
or
gentile
civilization
was
in
its
denial
or
ignorance
of
the
unity
of
the
human
race
as
well
as
the
unity
of
god
and
in
its
including
in
the
state
only
a
particular
class
of
the
territorial
people
while
it
held
all
the
rest
as
slaves
though
in
different
degrees
of
servitude
it
recognized
and
sustained
a
privileged
class
a
ruling
order
and
if
as
subsequently
did
the
venetian
aristocracy
it
recognized
democratic
equality
within
that
order
it
held
all
outside
of
it
to
be
less
than
men
and
without
political
rights
practically
power
was
an
attribute
of
birth
and
of
private
wealth
suffrage
was
almost
universal
among
freemen
but
down
almost
to
the
empire
the
people
voted
by
orders
and
were
counted
not
numerically
but
by
the
rank
of
the
order
and
the
comitia
curiata
could
always
carry
the
election
over
the
comitia
centuriata
and
thus
power
remained
always
in
the
hands
of
the
rich
and
noble
few
the
roman
law
as
digested
by
jurists
under
justinian
in
the
sixth
century
indeed
recognizes
the
unity
of
the
race
asserts
the
equality
of
all
men
by
the
natural
law
and
undertakes
to
defend
slavery
on
principles
not
incompatible
with
that
equality
it
represents
it
as
a
commutation
of
the
punishment
of
death
which
the
emperor
has
the
right
to
inflict
on
captives
taken
in
war
to
perpetual
servitude
and
as
servitude
is
less
severe
than
death
slavery
was
really
a
proof
of
imperial
clemency
but
it
has
never
yet
been
proved
that
the
emperor
has
the
right
under
the
natural
law
to
put
captives
taken
even
in
a
just
war
to
death
and
the
roman
poet
himself
bids
us
humble
the
proud
but
spare
the
submissive
in
a
just
war
the
emperor
may
kill
on
the
those
in
arms
against
him
but
the
jus
gentium
as
now
interpreted
by
the
jurisprudence
of
every
civilized
nation
does
not
allow
him
to
put
them
to
death
after
they
have
ceased
resistance
have
thrown
down
their
arms
and
surrendered
but
even
if
it
did
it
gives
him
a
right
only
over
the
persons
captured
not
over
their
innocent
children
and
therefore
no
right
to
establish
hereditary
slavery
for
the
child
is
not
punishable
for
the
offences
of
the
parent
the
law
indeed
assumed
that
the
captive
ceased
to
exist
as
a
person
and
treated
him
as
a
thing
or
mere
property
of
the
conqueror
and
being
property
he
could
beget
only
property
which
would
accrue
only
to
his
owner
but
there
is
no
power
in
heaven
or
earth
that
can
make
a
person
a
thing
a
mere
piece
of
merchandise
and
it
is
only
by
a
clumsy
fiction
or
rather
by
a
lie
that
the
law
denies
the
slave
his
personality
and
treats
him
as
a
thing
i
the
unity
of
all
men
had
been
clearly
seen
and
vividly
felt
the
law
would
never
have
attempted
to
justify
perpetual
slavery
on
the
ground
of
its
penal
character
or
indeed
on
any
ground
whatever
all
men
are
born
under
the
law
of
nature
with
equal
rights
and
the
civil
law
can
justly
deprive
no
man
of
his
liberty
but
for
a
crime
committed
by
him
personally
that
justly
forfeits
his
liberty
to
society
these
defects
of
the
civilization
the
european
nations
have
in
part
remedied
and
may
completely
remedy
they
can
carry
out
practically
the
christian
dogma
of
the
unity
of
the
human
race
abolish
slavery
in
every
form
make
all
men
equal
before
the
law
and
the
political
people
commensurate
with
the
territorial
people
indeed
france
has
already
done
it
she
has
abolished
slavery
villenage
serfage
political
aristocracy
asserted
the
equality
of
all
men
before
the
law
vindicated
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
and
established
universal
suffrage
complete
social
and
territorial
democracy
the
other
nations
may
do
as
much
but
hardly
can
any
of
them
do
more
or
advance
farther
yet
in
france
territorial
democracy
the
most
complete
results
only
in
establishing
the
most
complete
imperial
centralism
usually
called
caesarism
the
imperial
constitution
of
france
recognizes
that
the
emperor
reigns
by
the
grace
of
god
and
the
will
of
the
nation
and
therefore
that
by
the
grace
of
god
and
the
will
of
the
nation
he
may
cease
to
reign
but
while
he
reigns
he
is
supreme
and
his
will
is
law
the
constitution
imposes
no
real
or
effective
restraint
on
his
power
while
he
sits
upon
the
throne
he
is
practically
france
and
the
ministers
are
his
clerks
the
council
of
state
the
senate
and
the
legislative
body
are
merely
his
agents
in
governing
the
nation
this
may
indeed
be
changed
but
only
to
substitute
for
imperial
centralism
democratic
centralism
which
were
no
improvement
or
to
go
back
to
the
system
of
antagonisms
checks
and
balances
called
constitutionalism
or
parliamentary
government
of
which
great
britain
is
the
model
and
which
were
a
return
toward
barbarism
or
mediaeval
feudalism
the
human
race
has
its
life
in
god
and
tends
to
realize
in
all
orders
the
divine
word
or
logos
which
is
ionic
itself
and
the
principle
of
all
conciliation
of
the
dialectic
union
of
all
opposites
or
extremes
mankind
will
be
logical
and
the
worst
of
all
tyrannies
is
that
which
forbids
them
to
draw
from
their
principles
their
last
logical
consequences
or
that
prohibits
them
the
free
explication
and
application
of
the
divine
idea
in
which
consists
their
life
their
progress
such
tyranny
strikes
at
the
very
existence
of
society
and
wars
against
the
reality
of
things
it
is
supremely
sophistical
and
its
success
is
death
for
the
universe
in
its
constitution
is
supremely
logical

the

is
the

unites
the
two
extremes
whence
god
is

a
real
active

living
concrete
not
abstract
or
dead
unity
like
the
unity
of
old
xenophanes
plotinus
and
proclus
in
the
holy
trinity
is
the
principle
and
prototype
of
all
society
and
what
is
called
the
solidarity
of
the
race
is
only
the
outward
expression
or
copy
in
the
external
order
of
what
theologians
term
the
circumsession
of
the
three
divine
persons
of
the
godhead
now
human
society
when
it
copies
the
divine
essence
and
nature
either
in
the
distinction
of
persons
alone
or
in
the
unity
alone
is
sophistical
and
wants
the
principle
of
all
life
and
reality
it
sins
against
god
and
must
fail
of
its
end
the
english
system
which
is
based
on
antagonistic
elements
on
opposites
without
the
middle
term
that
conciliates
them
unites
them
and
makes
them
dialectically
one
copies
the
divine
model
in
its
distinctions
alone
which
considered
alone
are
opposites
or
contraries
it
denies
if
englishmen
could
but
see
it
the
unity
of
god
the
french
or
imperial
system
which
excludes
the
extremes
instead
of
uniting
them
denies
all
opposites
instead
of
conciliating
them
denies
the
distinctions
in
the
model
and
copies
only
the
unity
which
is
the
supreme
sophism
called
pantheism
the
english
constitution
has
no
middle
term
and
the
french
no
extremes
and
each
in
its
way
denies
the
divine
trinity
the
original
basis
and
type
of
the
syllogism
the
human
race
can
be
contented
with
neither
for
neither
allows
it
free
scope
for
its
inherent
life
and
activity
the
english
system
tends
to
pure
individualism
the
french
to
pure
socialism
or
despotism
each
endeavoring
to
suppress
an
element
of
the
one
living
and
indissoluble
truth
this
is
not
fancy
is
not
speculation
or
cold
and
lifeless
abstraction
but
the
highest
theological
and
philosophical
truth
without
which
there
were
no
reason
no
man
no
society
for
god
is
the
first
principle
of
all
being
all
existence
all
science
all
life
and
it
is
in
him
that
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
god
is
at
the
beginning
in
the
middle
and
at
the
end
of
all
things
the
universal
principle
medium
and
end
and
no
truth
can
be
denied
without
his
existence
being
directly
or
indirectly
impugned
in
a
deeper
sense
than
is
commonly
understood
is
it
true
that
nisi
dominus
aedificaverit
domum
in
vanum
laboraverunt
qui
aedificant
eam
the
english
constitution
is
composed
of
contradictory
elements
incapable
of
reconciliation
and
each
element
is
perpetually
struggling
with
the
others
for
the
mastery
for
a
long
time
the
king
labored
intrigued
and
fought
to
free
himself
from
the
thraldom
in
which
he
was
held
by
the
feudal
barons
in
the
aristocracy
and
people
united
and
humbled
the
crown
and
now
the
people
are
at
work
seeking
to
sap
both
the
crown
and
the
nobles
the
state
is
constituted
to
satisfaction
and
though
all
may
unite
in
boasting
its
excellences
all
are
at
work
trying
to
alter
or
amend
it
the
work
of
constituting
the
state
with
the
english
is
ever
beginning
never
ending
hence
the
eternal
clamor
for
parliamentary
reform
great
britain
and
other
european
states
may
sweep
away
all
that
remains
of
feudalism
include
the
whole
territorial
people
with
the
equal
rights
of
all
in
the
state
or
political
people
concede
to
birth
and
wealth
no
political
rights
but
they
will
by
so
doing
only
establish
either
imperial
centralism
as
has
been
done
in
france
or
democratic
centralism
clamored
for
conspired
for
and
fought
for
by
the
revolutionists
of
europe
the
special
merit
of
the
american
system
is
not
in
its
democracy
alone
as
too
many
at
home
and
abroad
imagine
but
along
with
its
democracy
in
the
division
of
the
powers
of
government
between
a
general
government
and
particular
state
governments
which
are
not
antagonistic
governments
for
they
act
on
different
matters
and
neither
is
nor
can
be
subordinated
to
the
other
now
this
division
of
power
which
decentralizes
the
government
without
creating
mutually
hostile
forces
can
hardly
be
introduced
into
any
european
state
there
may
be
a
union
of
states
in
great
britain
in
germany
in
italy
perhaps
in
spain
and
austria
is
laboring
hard
to
effect
it
in
her
heterogeneous
empire
but
the
union
possible
in
any
of
them
is
that
of
a
bund
or
confederation
like
the
swiss
or
german
bund
similar
to
what
the
secessionists
in
the
united
states
so
recently
attempted
and
have
so
signally
failed
to
establish
an
intelligent
confederate
officer
remarked
that
their
confederacy
had
not
been
in
operation
three
months
before
it
became
evident
that
the
principle
on
which
it
was
founded
if
not
rejected
would
insure
its
defeat
it
was
that
principle
of
state
sovereignty
for
which
the
states
seceded
more
than
the
superior
resources
and
numbers
of
the
government
that
caused
the
collapse
of
the
confederacy
the
numbers
were
relatively
about
equal
and
the
military
resources
of
the
confederacy
were
relatively
not
much
inferior
to
those
of
the
government
so
at
least
the
confederate
leaders
thought
and
they
knew
the
material
resources
of
the
government
as
well
as
their
own
and
had
calculated
them
with
as
much
care
and
accuracy
as
any
men
could
foreign
powers
also
friendly
as
well
as
unfriendly
felt
certain
that
the
secessionists
would
gain
their
independence
and
so
did
a
large
part
of
the
people
even
of
the
loyal
states
the
failure
is
due
to
the
disintegrating
principle
of
state
sovereignty
the
very
principle
of
the
confederacy
the
war
has
proved
that
united
states
are
other
things
being
equal
an
overmatch
for
confederated
states
the
european
states
must
unite
either
as
equals
or
as
unequals
as
equals
the
union
can
be
only
a
confederacy
a
sort
of
zollverein
in
which
each
state
retains
its
individual
sovereignty
if
as
unequals
then
someone
among
them
will
aspire
to
the
hegemony
and
you
have
over
again
the
athenian
confederation
formed
at
the
conclusion
of
the
persian
war
and
its
fate
a
union
like
the
american
can
not
be
created
by
a
compact
or
by
the
exercise
of
supreme
power
the
emperor
of
the
french
can
not
erect
the
several
departments
of
france
into
states
and
divide
the
powers
of
government
between
them
as
individual
and
as
united
states
they
would
necessarily
hold
from
the
imperial
government
which
though
it
might
exercise
a
large
part
of
its
functions
through
them
would
remain
as
now
the
supreme
central
government
from
which
all
governmental
powers
emanate
as
our
president
is
apparently
attempting
in
his
reconstruction
policy
to
make
the
government
of
the
united
states
the
elements
of
a
state
constituted
like
the
american
do
not
exist
in
any
european
nation
nor
in
the
constitution
of
european
society
and
the
american
constitution
would
have
been
impracticable
even
here
had
not
providence
so
ordered
it
that
the
nation
was
born
with
it
and
has
never
known
any
other
rome
recognized
the
necessity
of
the
federal
principle
and
applied
it
in
the
best
way
she
could
at
first
it
was
a
single
tribe
or
people
distributed
into
distinct
gentes
or
houses
after
the
sabine
war
a
second
tribe
was
added
on
terms
of
equality
and
the
state
was
dual
composed
of
two
tribes
the
ramnes
and
the
tities
or
quirites
and
afterward
in
the
time
of
tullus
hostilius
were
added
the
lucertes
or
luceres
making
the
division
into
three
ruling
tribes
each
divided
into
one
hundred
houses
or
gentes
each
house
in
each
tribe
was
represented
by
its
chief
or
decurion
in
the
senate
making
the
number
of
senators
exactly
three
hundred
at
which
number
the
senate
was
fixed
subsequently
was
added
by
ancus
the
plebs
who
remained
without
authority
or
share
in
the
government
of
the
city
of
rome
itself
though
they
might
aspire
to
the
first
rank
in
the
allied
cities
the
division
into
tribes
and
the
division
of
the
tribes
into
gentes
or
houses
and
the
vote
in
the
state
by
tribes
and
in
the
tribes
by
houses
effectually
excluded
democratic
centralism
but
the
division
was
not
a
division
of
the
powers
of
government
between
two
governments
for
the
senate
had
supreme
control
like
the
british
parliament
over
all
matters
general
and
particular
the
establishment
after
the
secession
of
the
plebs
of
the
tribunitial
veto
which
gave
the
plebeians
a
negative
power
in
the
state
there
was
an
incipient
division
of
the
powers
of
government
but
only
a
division
between
the
positive
and
negative
powers
not
between
the
general
and
the
particular
the
power
accorded
to
the
plebs
or
commons
as
niebuhr
calls
them
who
is
perhaps
too
fond
of
explaining
the
early
constitution
of
rome
by
analogies
borrowed
from
feudalism
and
especially
from
the
constitution
of
his
native
ditmarsch
was
simply
an
obstructive
power
and
when
it
by
development
became
a
positive
power
it
absorbed
all
the
powers
of
government
and
created
the
empire
there
was
indeed
a
nearer
approach
to
the
division
of
powers
in
the
american
system
between
imperial
rome
and
her
allied
or
confederated
municipalities
these
municipalities
modelled
chiefly
after
that
of
rome
were
elective
and
had
the
management
of
their
own
local
affairs
but
their
local
powers
were
not
in
their
own
sphere
with
those
exercised
by
the
roman
municipality
but
subordinate
and
dependent
the
senate
had
the
supreme
power
over
them
and
they
held
their
rights
subject
to
its
will
they
were
formally
or
virtually
subjugated
states
to
which
the
roman
senate
and
afterward
the
roman
emperors
left
the
form
of
the
state
and
the
mere
shadow
of
freedom
rome
owed
much
to
her
affecting
to
treat
them
as
allies
rather
than
as
subjects
and
at
first
these
municipal
organizations
secured
the
progress
of
civilization
in
the
provinces
but
at
a
later
period
under
the
emperors
they
served
only
the
imperial
treasury
and
were
crushed
by
the
taxes
imposed
and
the
contributions
levied
on
them
by
the
fiscal
agents
of
the
empire
so
heavy
were
the
fiscal
burdens
imposed
on
the
burgesses
if
the
term
may
be
used
that
it
needed
an
imperial
edict
to
compel
them
to
enter
the
municipal
government
and
it
became
under
the
later
emperors
no
uncommon
thing
for
free
citizens
to
sell
themselves
into
slavery
to
escape
the
fiscal
burdens
imposed
there
are
actually
imperial
edicts
extant
forbidden
freemen
to
sell
themselves
as
slaves
thus
ended
the
roman
federative
system
and
it
is
difficult
to
discover
in
europe
the
elements
of
a
federative
system
that
could
have
a
more
favorable
result
now
the
political
destiny
or
mission
of
the
united
states
is
in
common
with
the
european
nations
to
eliminate
the
barbaric
elements
retained
by
the
roman
constitution
and
specially
to
realize
that
philosophical
division
of
the
powers
of
government
which
distinguish
it
from
both
imperial
and
democratic
centralism
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
from
the
checks
and
balances
or
organized
antagonisms
which
seek
to
preserve
liberty
by
obstructing
the
exercise
of
power
no
greater
problem
in
statesmanship
remains
to
be
solved
and
no
greater
contribution
to
civilization
to
be
made
nowhere
else
than
in
this
new
world
and
in
this
new
world
only
in
the
united
states
can
this
problem
be
solved
or
this
contribution
be
made
and
what
the
republic
began
be
completed
but
the
united
states
have
a
religious
as
well
as
a
political
destiny
for
religion
and
politics
go
together
church
and
state
as
governments
are
separate
indeed
but
the
principles
on
which
the
state
is
founded
have
their
origin
and
ground
in
the
spiritual
order
in
the
principles
revealed
or
affirmed
by
religion
and
are
inseparable
from
them
there
is
no
state
without
god
any
more
than
there
is
a
church
without
christ
or
the
incarnation
an
atheist
may
be
a
politician
but
if
there
were
no
god
there
could
be
no
politics
theological
principles
are
the
basis
of
political
principles
the
created
universe
is
a
dialectic
whole
distinct
but
inseparable
from
its
creator
and
all
its
parts
cohere
and
are
essential
to
one
another
all
has
its
origin
and
prototype
in
the
triune
god
and
throughout
expresses
unity
in
triplicity
and
triplicity
in
unity
without
which
there
is
no
real
being
and
no
actual
or
possible
life
every
thing
has
its
principle
medium
and
end
natural
society
is
initial
civil
government
is
medial
the
church
is
teleological
but
the
three
are
only
distinctions
in
one
indissoluble
whole
man
as
we
have
seen
lives
by
communion
with
god
through
the
divine
creative
act
and
is
perfected
or
completed
only
through
the
incarnation
in
christ
the
word
made
flesh
true
he
communes
with
god
through
his
kind
and
through
external
nature
society
in
which
he
is
born
and
reared
and
property
through
which
he
derives
sustenance
for
his
body
but
these
are
only
media
of
his
communion
with
god
the
source
of
life
not
either
the
beginning
or
the
end
of
his
communion
they
have
no
life
in
themselves
since
their
being
is
in
god
and
of
themselves
can
impart
none
they
are
in
the
order
of
second
causes
and
second
causes
without
the
first
cause
are
nought
communion
which
stops
with
them
which
takes
them
as
the
principle
and
end
instead
of
media
as
they
are
is
the
communion
of
death
not
of
life
as
religion
includes
all
that
relates
to
communion
with
god
it
must
in
some
form
be
inseparable
from
every
living
act
of
man
both
individually
and
socially
and
in
the
long
run
men
must
conform
either
their
politics
to
their
religion
or
their
religion
to
their
politics
christianity
is
constantly
at
work
moulding
political
society
in
its
own
image
and
likeness
and
every
political
system
struggles
to
harmonize
christianity
with
itself
if
then
the
united
states
have
a
political
destiny
they
have
a
religious
destiny
inseparable
from
it
the
political
destiny
of
the
united
states
is
to
conform
the
state
to
the
order
of
reality
or
so
to
speak
to
the
divine
idea
in
creation
their
religious
destiny
is
to
render
practicable
and
to
realize
the
normal
relations
between
church
and
state
religion
and
politics
as
concreted
in
the
life
of
the
nation
in
politics
the
united
states
are
not
realizing
a
political
theory
of
any
sort
whatever
they
on
the
contrary
are
successfully
refuting
all
political
theories
making
away
with
them
and
establishing
the
state
not
on
a
theory
not
on
an
artificial
basis
or
a
foundation
laid
by
human
reason
or
will
but
on
reality
the
eternal
and
immutable
principles
in
relation
to
which
man
is
created
they
are
doing
the
same
in
regard
to
religious
theories
religion
is
not
a
theory
a
subjective
view
an
opinion
but
is
objectively
at
once
a
principle
a
law
and
a
fact
and
subjectively
it
is
by
the
aid
of
god
grace
practical
conformity
to
what
is
universally
true
and
real
the
united
states
in
fulfilment
of
their
destiny
are
making
as
sad
havoc
with
religious
theories
as
with
political
theories
and
are
pressing
on
with
irresistible
force
to
the
real
or
the
divine
order
which
is
expressed
in
the
christian
mysteries
which
exists
independent
of
understanding
and
will
and
which
man
can
neither
make
nor
unmake
the
religious
destiny
of
the
united
states
is
not
to
create
a
new
religion
nor
to
found
a
new
church
all
real
religion
is
catholic
and
is
neither
new
nor
old
but
is
always
and
everywhere
true
even
our
lord
came
neither
to
found
a
new
church
nor
to
create
a
new
religion
but
to
do
the
things
which
had
been
foretold
and
to
fulfil
in
time
what
had
been
determined
in
eternity
god
has
himself
founded
the
church
on
catholic
principles
or
principles
always
and
everywhere
real
principles
his
church
is
necessarily
catholic
because
founded
on
catholic
dogmas
and
the
dogmas
are
catholic
because
they
are
universal
and
immutable
principles
having
their
origin
and
ground
in
the
divine
being
himself
or
in
the
creative
act
by
which
he
produces
and
sustains
all
things
founded
on
universal
and
immutable
principles
the
church
can
never
grow
old
or
obsolete
but
is
the
church
for
all
times
and
places
for
all
ranks
and
conditions
of
men
man
can
not
change
either
the
church
or
the
dogmas
of
faith
for
they
are
founded
in
the
highest
reality
which
is
above
him
over
him
and
independent
of
him
religion
is
above
and
independent
of
the
state
and
the
state
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
church
or
her
dogmas
but
to
accept
and
conform
to
them
as
it
does
to
any
of
the
facts
or
principles
of
science
to
a
mathematical
truth
or
to
a
physical
law
but
while
the
church
with
her
essential
constitution
and
her
dogmas
are
founded
in
the
divine
order
and
are
catholic
and
unalterable
the
relations
between
the
civil
and
ecclesiastical
authorities
may
be
changed
or
modified
by
the
changes
of
time
and
place
these
relations
have
not
been
always
the
same
but
have
differed
in
different
ages
and
countries
during
the
first
three
centuries
of
our
era
the
church
had
no
legal
status
and
was
either
connived
at
or
persecuted
by
the
state
under
the
christian
emperors
she
was
recognized
by
the
civil
law
her
prelates
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
mixed
civil
and
ecclesiastical
questions
and
were
made
in
some
sense
civil
magistrates
and
paid
as
such
by
the
empire
under
feudalism
the
prelates
received
investiture
as
princes
and
barons
and
formed
alone
or
in
connection
with
the
temporal
lords
an
estate
in
the
kingdom
the
pope
became
a
temporal
prince
and
suzerain
at
one
time
of
a
large
part
of
europe
and
exercised
the
arbitratorship
in
all
grave
questions
between
christian
sovereigns
themselves
and
between
them
and
their
subjects
since
the
downfall
of
feudalism
and
the
establishment
of
modern
centralized
monarchy
the
church
has
been
robbed
of
the
greater
part
of
her
temporal
possessions
and
deprived
in
most
countries
of
all
civil
functions
and
treated
by
the
state
either
as
an
enemy
or
as
a
slave
in
all
the
sectarian
and
schismatic
states
of
the
old
world
the
national
church
is
held
in
strict
subjection
to
the
civil
authority
as
in
great
britain
and
russia
and
is
the
slave
of
the
state
in
the
other
states
of
europe
as
france
austria
spain
and
italy
she
is
treated
with
distrust
by
the
civil
government
and
allowed
hardly
a
shadow
of
freedom
and
independence
in
france
which
has
the
proud
title
of
eldest
daughter
of
the
church
catholics
as
such
are
not
freer
than
they
are
in
turkey
all
religious
are
said
to
be
free
and
all
are
free
except
the
religion
of
the
majority
of
frenchmen
the
emperor
because
nominally
a
catholic
takes
it
upon
himself
to
concede
the
church
just
as
much
and
just
as
little
freedom
in
the
empire
as
he
judges
expedient
for
his
own
secular
interests
in
italy
spain
portugal
mexico
and
the
central
and
south
american
states
the
policy
of
the
civil
authorities
is
the
same
or
worse
it
may
be
safely
asserted
that
except
in
the
united
states
the
church
is
either
held
by
the
civil
power
in
subjection
or
treated
as
an
enemy
the
relation
is
not
that
of
union
and
harmony
but
that
of
antagonism
to
the
grave
detriment
of
both
religion
and
civilization
it
is
impossible
even
if
it
were
desirable
to
restore
the
mixture
of
civil
and
ecclesiastical
governments
which
obtained
in
the
middle
ages
and
a
total
separation
of
church
and
state
even
as
corporations
would
in
the
present
state
of
men
minds
in
europe
be
construed
if
approved
by
the
church
into
a
sanction
by
her
of
political
atheism
or
the
right
of
the
civil
power
to
govern
according
to
its
own
will
and
pleasure
in
utter
disregard
of
the
law
of
god
the
moral
order
or
the
immutable
distinctions
between
right
and
wrong
it
could
only
favor
the
absolutism
of
the
state
and
put
the
temporal
in
the
place
of
the
spiritual
hence
the
holy
father
includes
the
proposition
of
the
entire
separation
of
church
and
state
in
the
syllabus
of
errors
condemned
in
his
encyclical
dated
at
rome
december
neither
the
state
nor
the
people
elsewhere
than
in
the
united
states
can
understand
practically
such
separation
in
any
other
sense
than
the
complete
emancipation
of
our
entire
secular
life
from
the
law
of
god
or
the
divine
order
which
is
the
real
order
it
is
not
the
union
of
church
and
state
that
is
the
union
or
identity
rather
of
religious
and
political
principles
that
it
is
desirable
to
get
rid
of
but
the
disunion
or
antagonism
of
church
and
state
but
this
is
nowhere
possible
out
of
the
united
states
for
nowhere
else
is
the
state
organized
on
catholic
principles
or
capable
of
acting
when
acting
from
its
own
constitution
in
harmony
with
a
really
catholic
church
or
the
religious
order
really
existing
in
relation
to
which
all
things
are
created
and
governed
nowhere
else
is
it
practicable
at
present
to
maintain
between
the
two
powers
their
normal
relations
but
what
is
not
practicable
in
the
old
world
is
perfectly
practicable
in
the
new
the
state
here
being
organized
in
accordance
with
catholic
principles
there
can
be
no
antagonism
between
it
and
the
church
though
operating
in
different
spheres
both
are
in
their
respective
spheres
developing
and
applying
to
practical
life
the
one
and
the
same
divine
idea
the
church
can
trust
the
state
and
the
state
can
trust
the
church
both
act
from
the
same
principle
to
one
and
the
same
end
each
by
its
own
constitution
with
aids
and
completes
the
other
it
is
true
the
church
is
not
formally
established
as
the
civil
law
of
the
land
nor
is
it
necessary
that
she
should
be
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
state
that
conflicts
with
her
freedom
and
independence
with
her
dogmas
or
her
irreformable
canons
the
need
of
establishing
the
church
by
law
and
protecting
her
by
legal
pains
and
penalties
as
is
still
done
in
most
countries
can
exist
only
in
a
barbarous
or
state
of
society
where
the
state
is
not
organized
on
catholic
principles
or
the
civilization
is
based
on
false
principles
and
in
its
development
tends
not
to
the
real
or
divine
order
of
things
when
the
state
is
constituted
in
harmony
with
that
order
it
is
carried
onward
by
the
force
of
its
own
internal
constitution
in
a
catholic
direction
and
a
church
establishment
or
what
is
called
a
state
religion
would
be
an
anomaly
or
a
superfluity
the
true
religion
is
in
the
heart
of
the
state
as
its
informing
principle
and
real
interior
life
the
external
establishment
by
legal
enactment
of
the
church
would
afford
her
no
additional
protection
add
nothing
to
her
power
and
efficacy
and
effect
nothing
for
faith
or
piety
neither
of
which
can
be
forced
because
both
must
from
their
nature
be
offerings
to
god
in
the
united
states
false
religions
are
legally
as
free
as
the
true
religion
but
all
false
religions
being
sophistical
and
uncatholic
are
opposed
by
the
principles
of
the
state
which
tend
by
their
silent
but
effective
workings
to
eliminate
them
the
american
state
recognizes
only
the
catholic
religion
it
eschews
all
sectarianism
and
none
of
the
sects
have
been
able
to
get
their
peculiarities
incorporated
into
its
constitution
or
its
laws
the
state
conforms
to
what
each
holds
that
is
catholic
that
is
always
and
everywhere
religion
and
what
ever
is
not
catholic
it
leaves
as
outside
of
its
province
to
live
or
die
according
to
its
own
inherent
vitality
or
want
of
vitality
the
state
conscience
is
catholic
not
sectarian
hence
it
is
that
the
utmost
freedom
can
be
allowed
to
all
religions
the
false
as
well
as
the
true
for
the
state
being
catholic
in
its
constitution
can
never
suffer
the
adherents
of
the
false
to
oppress
the
consciences
of
the
adherents
of
the
true
the
church
being
free
and
the
state
harmonizing
with
her
catholicity
has
in
the
freedom
of
both
all
the
protection
it
needs
all
the
security
it
can
ask
and
all
the
support
it
can
in
the
nature
of
the
case
receive
from
external
institutions
or
from
social
and
political
organizations
this
freedom
may
not
be
universally
wise
or
prudent
for
all
nations
may
not
be
prepared
for
it
all
may
not
have
attained
their
majority
the
church
as
well
as
the
state
must
deal
with
men
and
nations
as
they
are
not
as
they
are
not
to
deal
with
a
child
as
with
an
adult
or
with
a
barbarous
nation
as
with
a
civilized
nation
would
be
only
acting
a
lie
the
church
can
not
treat
men
as
free
men
where
they
are
not
free
men
nor
appeal
to
reason
in
those
in
whom
reason
is
undeveloped
she
must
adapt
her
discipline
to
the
age
condition
and
culture
of
individuals
and
to
the
greater
or
less
progress
of
nations
in
civilization
she
herself
remains
always
the
same
in
her
constitution
her
authority
and
her
faith
but
varies
her
discipline
with
the
variations
of
time
and
place
many
of
her
canons
very
proper
and
necessary
in
one
age
cease
to
be
so
in
another
and
many
which
are
needed
in
the
old
world
would
be
out
of
place
in
the
new
world
under
the
american
system
she
can
deal
with
the
people
as
free
men
and
trust
them
as
freemen
because
free
men
they
are
the
freeman
asks
why
and
the
reason
why
must
be
given
him
or
his
obedience
fails
to
be
secured
the
simple
reason
that
the
church
commands
will
rarely
satisfy
him
he
would
know
why
she
commands
this
or
that
the
free
man
revolts
at
blind
obedience
and
he
regards
all
obedience
as
in
some
measure
blind
for
which
he
sees
only
an
extrinsic
command
blind
obedience
even
to
the
authority
of
the
church
can
not
be
expected
of
the
people
reared
under
the
american
system
not
because
they
are
filled
with
the
spirit
of
disobedience
but
because
they
insist
that
obedience
shall
be
rationabile
obsequium
an
act
of
the
understanding
not
of
the
will
or
the
affections
alone
they
are
trained
to
demand
a
reason
for
the
command
given
them
to
distinguish
between
the
law
and
the
person
of
the
magistrate
they
can
obey
god
but
not
man
and
they
must
see
that
the
command
given
has
its
reason
in
the
divine
order
or
the
intrinsic
catholic
reason
of
things
or
they
will
not
yield
it
a
full
entire
and
hearty
obedience
the
reason
that
suffices
for
the
child
does
not
suffice
for
the
adult
and
the
reason
that
suffices
for
barbarians
does
not
suffice
for
civilized
men
or
that
suffices
for
nations
in
the
infancy
of
their
civilization
does
not
suffice
for
them
in
its
maturity
the
appeal
to
external
authority
was
much
less
frequent
under
the
roman
empire
than
in
the
barbarous
ages
that
followed
its
downfall
when
the
church
became
mixed
up
with
the
state
this
trait
of
the
american
character
is
not
uncatholic
an
intelligent
free
willing
obedience
yielded
from
personal
conviction
after
seeing
its
reasonableness
its
justice
its
logic
in
the
divine
order
the
obedience
of
a
free
man
not
of
a
slave
is
far
more
consonant
to
the
spirit
of
the
church
and
far
more
acceptable
to
god
than
simple
blind
obedience
and
a
people
capable
of
yielding
it
stand
far
higher
in
the
scale
of
civilization
than
the
people
that
must
be
governed
as
children
or
barbarians
it
is
possible
that
the
people
of
the
old
world
are
not
prepared
for
the
regimen
of
freedom
in
religion
any
more
than
they
are
prepared
for
freedom
in
politics
for
they
have
been
trained
only
to
obey
external
authority
and
are
not
accustomed
to
look
on
religion
as
having
its
reason
in
the
real
order
or
in
the
reason
of
things
they
understand
no
reason
for
obedience
beyond
the
external
command
and
do
not
believe
it
possible
to
give
or
to
understand
the
reason
why
the
command
itself
is
given
they
regard
the
authority
of
the
church
as
a
thing
apart
and
see
no
way
by
which
faith
and
reason
can
be
harmonized
they
look
upon
them
as
antagonistic
forces
rather
than
as
integral
elements
of
one
and
the
same
whole
concede
them
the
regimen
of
freedom
and
their
religion
has
no
support
but
in
their
their
affections
their
associations
their
habits
and
their
prejudices
it
has
no
root
in
their
rational
convictions
and
when
they
begin
to
reason
they
begin
to
doubt
this
is
not
the
state
of
things
that
is
desirable
but
it
can
not
be
remedied
under
the
political
regime
established
elsewhere
than
in
the
united
states
in
every
state
in
the
world
except
the
american
the
civil
constitution
is
sophistical
and
violates
more
or
less
the
logic
of
things
and
therefore
in
no
one
of
them
can
the
people
receive
a
thoroughly
dialectic
training
or
an
education
in
strict
conformity
to
the
real
order
hence
in
them
all
the
church
is
more
or
less
obstructed
in
her
operations
and
prevented
from
carrying
out
in
its
fulness
her
own
divine
idea
she
does
the
best
she
can
in
the
circumstances
and
with
the
materials
with
which
she
is
supplied
and
exerts
herself
continually
to
bring
individuals
and
nations
into
harmony
with
her
divine
law
but
still
her
life
in
the
midst
of
the
nations
is
a
struggle
a
warfare
the
united
states
being
dialectically
constituted
and
founded
on
real
catholic
not
sectarian
or
sophistical
principles
presents
none
of
these
obstacles
and
must
in
their
progressive
development
or
realization
of
their
political
idea
put
an
end
to
this
warfare
in
so
far
as
a
warfare
between
church
and
state
and
leave
the
church
in
her
normal
position
in
society
in
which
she
can
without
let
or
hindrance
exert
her
free
spirit
and
teach
and
govern
men
by
the
divine
law
as
free
men
she
may
encounter
unbelief
misbelief
ignorance
and
indifference
in
few
or
in
many
but
these
deriving
no
support
from
the
state
which
tends
constantly
to
eliminate
them
must
gradually
give
way
before
her
invincible
logic
her
divine
charity
the
truth
and
reality
of
things
and
the
intelligence
activity
and
zeal
of
her
ministers
the
american
people
are
on
the
surface
sectarians
or
indifferentists
but
they
are
in
reality
less
uncatholic
than
the
people
of
any
other
country
because
they
are
in
their
intellectual
and
moral
development
nearer
to
the
real
order
or
in
the
higher
and
broader
sense
of
the
word
more
truly
civilized
the
multitude
of
sects
that
obtain
may
excite
religious
compassion
for
those
who
are
carried
away
by
them
for
men
can
be
saved
or
attain
to
their
eternal
destiny
only
by
truth
or
conformity
to
him
who
said
i
am
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
but
in
relation
to
the
national
destiny
they
need
excite
no
alarm
no
uneasiness
for
underlying
them
all
is
more
or
less
of
catholic
truth
and
the
vital
forces
of
the
national
life
repel
them
in
so
far
as
they
are
sectarian
and
not
catholic
as
substances
that
can
not
be
assimilated
to
the
national
life
the
american
state
being
catholic
in
its
organic
principles
as
is
all
real
religion
and
the
church
being
free
whatever
is
anticatholic
or
uncatholic
is
without
any
support
in
either
and
having
none
either
in
reality
or
in
itself
it
must
necessarily
fall
and
gradually
disappear
the
sects
themselves
have
a
half
unavowed
conviction
that
they
can
not
subsist
forever
as
sects
if
unsupported
by
the
civil
authority
they
are
free
but
do
not
feel
safe
in
the
united
states
they
know
the
real
church
is
catholic
and
that
they
themselves
are
none
of
them
catholic
the
most
daring
among
them
even
pretends
to
be
no
more
than
a
branch
of
the
catholic
church
they
know
that
only
the
catholic
church
can
withstand
the
pressure
of
events
and
survive
the
shocks
of
time
and
hence
everywhere
their
movements
to
get
rid
of
their
sectarianism
and
to
gain
a
catholic
character
they
hold
conventions
of
delegates
from
the
whole
sectarian
world
form
unions
alliances
and
associations
but
unhappily
for
their
success
the
catholic
church
does
not
originate
in
convention
but
is
founded
by
the
word
made
flesh
and
sustained
by
the
indwelling
holy
ghost
the
most
they
can
do
even
with
the
best
dispositions
in
the
world
is
to
create
a
confederation
and
confederated
sects
are
something
very
different
from
a
church
inherently
one
and
catholic
it
is
no
more
the
catholic
church
than
the
late
southern
confederacy
was
the
american
state
the
sectarian
combinations
may
do
some
harm
may
injure
many
souls
and
retard
for
a
time
the
progress
of
civilization
but
in
a
state
organized
in
accordance
with
catholic
principles
and
left
to
themselves
they
are
powerless
against
the
national
destiny
and
must
soon
wither
and
die
as
branches
severed
from
the
vine
such
being
the
case
no
sensible
catholic
can
imagine
that
the
church
needs
any
physical
force
against
the
sects
except
to
repel
actual
violence
and
protect
her
in
that
freedom
of
speech
and
possession
which
is
the
right
of
all
before
the
state
what
are
called
religious
establishments
are
needed
only
where
either
the
state
is
barbarous
or
the
religion
is
sectarian
where
the
state
in
its
intrinsic
constitution
is
in
accordance
with
catholic
principles
as
in
the
united
states
the
church
has
all
she
needs
or
can
receive
the
state
can
add
nothing
more
to
her
power
or
her
security
in
her
moral
and
spiritual
warfare
with
sectarianism
and
any
attempt
to
give
her
more
would
only
weaken
her
as
against
the
sects
place
her
in
a
false
light
partially
justify
their
hostility
to
her
render
effective
their
declamations
against
her
mix
her
up
unnecessarily
with
political
changes
interests
and
passions
and
distract
the
attention
of
her
ministers
from
their
proper
work
as
churchmen
and
impose
on
them
the
duties
of
politicians
and
statesmen
where
there
is
nothing
in
the
state
hostile
to
the
church
where
she
is
free
to
act
according
to
her
own
constitution
and
laws
and
exercise
her
own
discipline
on
her
own
spiritual
subjects
civil
enactments
in
her
favor
or
against
the
sects
may
embarrass
or
impede
her
operations
but
can
not
aid
her
for
she
can
advance
no
farther
than
she
wins
the
heart
and
convinces
the
understanding
a
spiritual
work
can
in
the
nature
of
things
be
effected
only
by
spiritual
means
the
church
wants
freedom
in
relation
to
the
state
nothing
more
for
all
her
power
comes
immediately
from
god
without
any
intervention
or
mediation
of
the
state
the
united
states
constituted
in
accordance
with
the
real
order
of
things
and
founded
on
principles
which
have
their
origin
and
ground
in
the
principles
on
which
the
church
herself
is
founded
can
never
establish
any
one
of
the
sects
as
the
religion
of
the
state
for
that
would
violate
their
political
constitution
and
array
all
the
other
sects
as
well
as
the
church
herself
against
the
government
they
can
not
be
called
upon
to
establish
the
church
by
law
because
she
is
already
in
their
constitution
as
far
as
the
state
has
in
itself
any
relation
with
religion
and
because
to
establish
her
in
any
other
sense
would
be
to
make
her
one
of
the
civil
institutions
of
the
land
and
to
bring
her
under
the
control
of
the
state
which
were
equally
against
her
interest
and
her
nature
the
religious
mission
of
the
united
states
is
not
then
to
establish
the
church
by
external
law
or
to
protect
her
by
legal
disabilities
pains
and
penalties
against
the
sects
however
uncatholic
they
may
be
but
to
maintain
catholic
freedom
neither
absorbing
the
state
in
the
church
nor
the
church
in
the
state
but
leaving
each
to
move
freely
according
to
its
own
nature
in
the
sphere
assigned
it
in
the
eternal
order
of
things
their
mission
separates
church
and
state
as
external
governing
bodies
but
unites
them
in
the
interior
principles
from
which
each
derives
its
vitality
and
force
their
union
is
in
the
intrinsic
unity
of
principle
and
in
the
fact
that
though
moving
in
different
spheres
each
obeys
one
and
the
same
divine
law
with
this
the
catholic
who
knows
what
catholicity
means
is
of
course
satisfied
for
it
gives
the
church
all
the
advantage
over
the
sects
of
the
real
over
the
unreal
and
with
this
the
sects
have
no
right
to
be
dissatisfied
for
it
subjects
them
to
no
disadvantage
not
inherent
in
sectarianism
itself
in
presence
of
catholicity
and
without
any
support
from
the
civil
authority
the
effect
of
this
mission
of
our
country
fully
realized
would
be
to
harmonize
church
and
state
religion
and
politics
not
by
absorbing
either
in
the
other
or
by
obliterating
the
natural
distinction
between
them
but
by
conforming
both
to
the
real
or
divine
order
which
is
supreme
and
immutable
it
places
the
two
powers
in
their
normal
relation
which
has
hitherto
never
been
done
because
hitherto
there
never
has
been
a
state
normally
constituted
the
nearest
approach
made
to
the
realization
of
the
proper
relations
of
church
and
state
prior
to
the
birth
of
the
american
republic
was
in
the
roman
empire
under
the
christian
emperors
but
the
state
had
been
perverted
by
paganism
and
the
emperors
inheriting
the
old
pontifical
power
could
never
be
made
to
understand
their
own
incompetency
in
spirituals
and
persisted
to
the
last
in
treating
the
church
as
a
civil
institution
under
their
supervision
and
control
as
does
the
emperor
of
the
french
in
france
even
yet
in
the
middle
ages
the
state
was
so
barbarously
constituted
that
the
church
was
obliged
to
supervise
its
administration
to
mix
herself
up
with
the
civil
government
in
order
to
infuse
some
intelligence
into
civil
matters
and
to
preserve
her
own
rightful
freedom
and
independence
when
the
states
broke
away
from
feudalism
they
revived
the
roman
constitution
and
claimed
the
authority
in
ecclesiastical
matters
that
had
been
exercised
by
the
roman
caesars
and
the
states
that
adopted
a
sectarian
religion
gave
the
sect
adopted
a
civil
establishment
and
subjected
it
to
the
civil
government
to
which
the
sect
not
unwillingly
consented
on
condition
that
the
civil
authority
excluded
the
church
and
all
other
sects
and
made
it
the
exclusive
religion
of
the
state
as
in
england
scotland
sweden
denmark
russia
and
the
states
of
northern
germany
even
yet
the
normal
relations
of
church
and
state
are
nowhere
practicable
in
the
old
world
for
everywhere
either
the
state
is
more
or
less
barbaric
in
its
constitution
or
the
religion
is
sectarian
and
the
church
as
well
as
civilization
is
obliged
to
struggle
with
antagonistic
forces
for
there
are
formidable
parties
all
over
europe
at
work
to
introduce
what
they
take
to
be
the
american
system
but
constitutions
are
generated
not
made
providential
not
conventional
statesmen
can
only
develop
what
is
in
the
existing
constitutions
of
their
respective
countries
and
no
european
constitution
contains
all
the
elements
of
the
american
european
liberals
mistake
the
american
system
and
were
they
to
succeed
in
their
efforts
would
not
introduce
it
but
something
more
hostile
to
it
than
the
governments
and
institutions
they
are
warring
against
they
start
from
narrow
sectarian
or
infidel
premises
and
seek
not
freedom
of
worship
but
freedom
of
denial
they
suppress
the
freedom
of
religion
as
the
means
of
securing
what
they
call
religious
liberty
imagine
that
they
secure
freedom
of
thought
by
extinguishing
the
light
without
which
no
thought
is
possible
and
advance
civilization
by
undermining
its
foundation
the
condemnation
of
their
views
and
movements
by
the
holy
father
in
the
encyclical
which
has
excited
so
much
hostility
may
seem
to
superficial
and
unthinking
americans
even
as
a
condemnation
of
our
american
system
indeed
as
the
condemnation
of
modern
science
intelligence
and
civilization
itself
but
whoever
looks
below
the
surface
has
some
insight
into
the
course
of
events
understands
the
propositions
and
movements
censured
and
the
sense
in
which
they
are
censured
is
well
assured
that
the
holy
father
has
simply
exercised
his
pastoral
and
teaching
authority
to
save
religion
society
science
and
civilization
from
utter
corruption
or
destruction
the
opinions
tendencies
and
movements
directly
or
by
implication
censured
are
the
effect
of
narrow
and
superficial
thinking
of
partial
and
views
and
are
sectarian
sophistical
and
hostile
to
all
real
progress
and
tend
as
far
as
they
go
to
throw
society
back
into
the
barbarism
from
which
after
centuries
of
toil
and
struggle
it
is
just
beginning
to
emerge
the
holy
father
has
condemned
nothing
that
real
philosophy
real
science
does
not
also
condemn
nothing
in
fact
that
is
not
at
war
with
the
american
system
itself
for
the
mass
of
the
people
it
were
desirable
that
fuller
explanations
should
be
given
of
the
sense
in
which
the
various
propositions
censured
are
condemned
for
some
of
them
are
not
in
every
sense
false
but
the
explanations
needed
were
expected
by
the
holy
father
to
be
given
by
the
bishops
and
prelates
to
whom
not
to
the
people
save
through
them
the
encyclical
was
addressed
little
is
to
be
hoped
and
much
is
to
be
feared
for
liberty
science
and
civilization
from
european
liberalism
which
has
no
real
affinity
with
american
territorial
democracy
and
real
civil
and
religious
freedom
but
god
and
reality
are
present
in
the
old
world
as
well
as
in
the
new
and
it
will
never
do
to
restrict
their
power
or
freedom
whether
the
american
people
will
prove
faithful
to
their
mission
and
realize
their
destiny
or
not
is
known
only
to
him
from
whom
nothing
is
hidden
providence
is
free
and
leaves
always
a
space
for
human
the
american
people
can
fail
and
will
fail
if
they
neglect
the
appointed
means
and
conditions
of
success
but
there
is
nothing
in
their
present
state
or
in
their
past
history
to
render
their
failure
probable
they
have
in
their
internal
constitution
what
rome
wanted
and
they
are
in
no
danger
of
being
crushed
by
exterior
barbarism
their
success
as
feeble
colonies
of
great
britain
in
achieving
their
national
independence
and
especially
in
maintaining
unaided
and
against
the
real
hostility
of
great
britain
and
france
their
national
unity
and
integrity
against
a
rebellion
which
probably
no
other
people
could
have
survived
gives
reasonable
assurance
for
their
future
the
leaders
of
the
rebellion
than
whom
none
better
knew
or
more
nicely
calculated
the
strength
and
resources
of
the
union
counted
with
certainty
on
success
and
the
ablest
the
most
experienced
and
best
informed
statesmen
of
the
old
world
felt
sure
that
the
republic
was
gone
and
spoke
of
it
as
the
late
united
states
not
a
few
even
in
the
loyal
states
who
had
no
sympathy
with
the
rebellion
believed
it
idle
to
think
of
suppressing
it
by
force
and
advised
peace
on
the
best
terms
that
could
be
obtained
but
ilium
fuit
was
chanted
too
soon
the
american
people
were
equal
to
the
emergency
and
falsified
the
calculations
and
predictions
of
their
enemies
and
surpassed
the
expectations
of
their
friends
the
attitude
of
the
real
american
people
during
the
fearful
struggle
affords
additional
confidence
in
their
destiny
with
larger
armies
on
foot
than
napoleon
ever
commanded
with
their
line
of
battle
stretching
from
ocean
to
ocean
across
the
whole
breadth
of
the
continent
they
never
during
four
long
years
of
alternate
victories
and
defeats
and
both
unprecedentedly
bloody
for
a
moment
lost
their
equanimity
or
appeared
less
calm
collected
tranquil
than
in
the
ordinary
times
of
peace
they
not
for
a
moment
interrupted
their
ordinary
routine
of
business
or
pleasure
or
seemed
conscious
of
being
engaged
in
any
serious
struggle
which
required
an
effort
there
was
no
hurry
no
bustle
no
excitement
no
fear
no
misgiving
they
seemed
to
regard
the
war
as
a
mere
bagatelle
not
worth
being
in
earnest
about
the
was
almost
angry
with
their
apparent
indifference
apparent
insensibility
and
doubted
if
they
moved
at
all
yet
move
they
did
guided
by
an
unerring
instinct
they
moved
quietly
on
with
an
elemental
force
in
spite
of
a
timid
and
hesitating
administration
in
spite
of
inexperienced
incompetent
or
blundering
military
commanders
whom
they
gently
brushed
aside
and
desisted
not
till
their
object
was
gained
and
they
saw
the
flag
of
the
union
floating
anew
in
the
breeze
from
the
capitol
of
every
state
that
dared
secede
no
man
could
contemplate
them
without
feeling
that
there
was
in
them
a
latent
power
vastly
superior
to
any
which
they
judged
it
necessary
to
put
forth
their
success
proves
to
all
that
what
prior
to
the
war
was
treated
as
american
arrogance
or
was
only
the
outspoken
confidence
in
their
destiny
as
a
providential
people
conscious
that
to
them
is
reserved
the
hegemony
of
the
world
count
de
maistre
predicted
early
in
the
century
the
failure
of
the
united
states
because
they
have
no
proper
name
but
his
prediction
assumed
what
is
not
the
fact
the
united
states
have
a
proper
name
by
which
all
the
world
knows
and
calls
them
the
proper
name
of
the
country
is
america
that
of
the
people
is
americans
speak
of
americans
simply
and
nobody
understands
you
to
mean
the
people
of
canada
mexico
brazil
peru
chile
paraguay
but
everybody
understands
you
to
mean
the
people
of
the
united
states
the
fact
is
significant
and
foretells
for
the
people
of
the
united
states
a
continental
destiny
as
is
also
foreshadowed
in
the
monroe
doctrine
which
france
during
our
domestic
troubles
was
permitted
on
condition
of
not
intervening
in
our
civil
war
in
favor
of
the
rebellion
to
violate
there
was
no
statesmanship
in
proclaiming
the
monroe
doctrine
for
the
statesman
keeps
always
as
far
as
possible
his
government
free
to
act
according
to
the
exigencies
of
the
case
when
it
comes
up
unembarrassed
by
previous
declarations
of
principles
yet
the
doctrine
only
expresses
the
destiny
of
the
american
people
and
which
nothing
but
their
own
fault
can
prevent
them
from
realizing
in
its
own
good
time
napoleon
will
not
succeed
in
his
mexican
policy
and
mexico
will
add
some
fifteen
or
twenty
new
states
to
the
american
union
as
soon
as
it
is
clearly
for
the
interests
of
all
parties
that
it
should
be
done
and
it
can
be
done
by
mutual
consent
without
war
or
violence
the
union
will
fight
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
her
domain
and
the
supremacy
of
her
laws
within
it
but
she
can
never
consistently
with
her
principles
or
her
interests
enter
upon
a
career
of
war
and
conquest
her
system
is
violated
endangered
not
extended
by
subjugating
her
neighbors
for
subjugation
and
liberty
go
not
together
annexation
when
it
takes
place
must
be
on
terms
of
perfect
equality
and
by
the
free
act
of
the
state
annexed
the
union
can
admit
of
no
inequality
of
rights
and
franchises
between
the
states
of
which
it
is
composed
the
canadian
provinces
and
the
mexican
and
central
american
states
when
annexed
must
be
as
free
as
the
original
states
of
the
union
sharing
alike
in
the
power
and
the
protection
of
the
republic
alike
in
its
authority
its
freedom
its
grandeur
and
its
glory
as
one
free
independent
people
they
may
gain
much
but
must
lose
nothing
by
annexation
the
emperor
napoleon
and
his
very
respectable
protege
maximilian
an
able
man
and
a
prince
can
change
nothing
in
the
destiny
of
the
united
states
or
of
mexico
herself
no
imperial
government
can
be
permanent
beside
the
american
republic
no
longer
liable
since
the
abolition
of
slavery
to
be
distracted
by
sectional
dissensions
the
states
that
seceded
will
soon
in
some
way
be
restored
to
their
rights
and
franchises
in
the
union
forming
not
the
least
patriotic
portion
of
the
american
people
the
negro
question
will
be
settled
or
settle
itself
as
is
most
likely
by
the
melting
away
of
the
negro
population
before
the
influx
of
white
laborers
all
traces
of
the
late
contest
in
a
very
few
years
will
be
wiped
out
the
national
debt
paid
or
greatly
reduced
and
the
prosperity
and
strength
of
the
republic
be
greater
than
ever
its
moral
force
will
sweep
away
every
imperial
throne
on
the
continent
without
any
effort
or
action
on
the
part
of
the
government
there
can
be
no
stable
government
in
mexico
till
every
trace
of
the
ecclesiastical
policy
established
by
the
council
of
the
indies
is
obliterated
and
the
church
placed
there
on
the
same
footing
as
in
the
united
states
and
that
can
hardly
be
done
without
annexation
maximilian
can
not
divest
the
church
of
her
temporal
possessions
and
place
protestants
and
catholics
on
the
same
footing
without
offending
the
present
church
party
and
deeply
injuring
religion
and
that
too
without
winning
the
confidence
of
the
republican
party
in
all
spanish
and
portuguese
america
the
relations
between
the
church
and
state
are
abnormal
and
exceedingly
hurtful
to
both
religion
is
in
a
wretched
condition
and
politics
in
a
worse
condition
still
there
is
no
effectual
remedy
for
either
but
in
religious
freedom
now
impracticable
and
to
be
rendered
practicable
by
no
european
intervention
for
that
subjects
religion
to
the
state
the
very
source
of
the
evils
that
now
exist
instead
of
emancipating
it
from
the
state
and
leaving
it
to
act
according
to
its
own
constitution
and
laws
as
under
the
american
system
but
the
american
people
need
not
trouble
themselves
about
their
exterior
expansion
that
will
come
of
itself
as
fast
as
desirable
let
them
devote
their
attention
to
their
internal
destiny
to
the
realization
of
their
mission
within
and
they
will
gradually
see
the
whole
continent
coming
under
their
system
forming
one
grand
nation
a
really
catholic
nation
great
glorious
and
free
