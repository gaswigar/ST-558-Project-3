unemployed
at
last
scientifically
such
a
contingency
can
never
have
befallen
of
itself
according
to
one
theory
of
the
universe
the
momentum
of
original
impress
has
been
tending
toward
this
divine
event
ever
since
a
scrap
of
flew
from
the
solar
centre
to
form
our
planet
not
this
event
alone
of
course
but
every
occurrence
past
and
present
from
the
fall
of
captured
troy
to
the
fall
of
a
captured
insect
according
to
another
theory
i
hold
an
independent
diploma
as
one
of
the
architects
of
our
social
system
with
a
commission
to
use
my
own
judgment
and
take
my
own
risks
like
any
other
unit
of
humanity
this
theory
unlike
the
first
entails
frequent
hitches
and
and
to
some
malign
operation
of
these
i
should
owe
my
present
holiday
orthodoxly
we
are
reduced
to
one
assumption
namely
that
my
indomitable
old
adversary
has
suddenly
called
to
mind
watts
friendly
hint
respecting
the
easy
enlistment
of
idle
hands
good
if
either
of
the
two
first
hypotheses
be
correct
my
enforced
furlough
tacitly
conveys
the
responsibility
of
extending
a
ray
of
information
however
narrow
and
feeble
across
the
path
of
such
as
have
led
lives
more
sedentary
than
my
own
particularly
as
i
have
enough
money
to
frank
myself
in
a
frugal
way
for
some
weeks
as
well
as
to
purchase
the
few
requisites
of
authorship
if
on
the
other
hand
my
supposed
safeguard
of
drudgery
has
been
cut
off
at
the
meter
by
that
amusingly
old
conspirator
it
will
be
only
fair
to
notify
him
that
his
age
and
experience
even
his
captivating
habits
and
hospitality
will
be
treated
with
scorn
rather
than
respect
in
the
paragraphs
which
he
virtually
forces
me
to
write
and
he
is
hereby
invited
to
view
his
own
feather
on
the
fatal
dart
whilst
a
peculiar
defect
which
i
scarcely
like
to
call
an
oversight
in
mental
construction
shuts
me
out
from
the
flowery
pathway
of
the
romancer
a
requital
endows
me
i
trust
with
the
more
sterling
if
less
ornamental
qualities
of
the
chronicler
this
fairly
equitable
compensation
embraces
i
have
been
told
three
distinct
attributes
an
intuition
which
reads
men
like
a
limpid
veracity
and
a
memory
which
habitually
stereotypes
all
impressions
except
those
relating
to
personal
injuries
submitting
then
to
the
constitutional
interdict
already
glanced
at
and
availing
myself
of
the
implied
license
to
utilise
that
homely
talent
of
which
i
am
the
bailee
i
purpose
taking
certain
entries
from
my
diary
and
amplifying
these
to
the
minutest
detail
of
occurrence
or
conversation
this
will
afford
to
the
observant
reader
a
fair
picture
of
life
as
that
engaging
problem
has
presented
itself
to
me
consecutive
editions
of
lett
pocket
diary
with
one
week
in
each
opening
lie
on
the
table
before
me
all
filled
up
and
in
a
decent
state
of
preservation
i
think
i
shall
undertake
the
annotation
of
a
week
record
a
man
might
if
he
were
of
a
fearful
heart
stagger
in
this
attempt
but
i
shut
my
eyes
and
take
up
one
of
the
little
volumes
it
proves
to
be
the
edition
of
again
i
shut
my
eyes
while
i
open
the
book
at
random

the
fore
part
of

was
altogether
devoid

or

overhead
the
sun
blazing
wastefully
and
thanklessly
through
a
rarefied
atmosphere
underfoot
the
hot
black
clay
thirsting
for

for

we
go
at
a

the

and

by

away
beyond

carries
that
monotony
across
the
zone
of
myall

swamp
box
across
the
lachlan
and
murrumbidgee
and
on
to
the
victorian
border
say
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
just
about
the
station
track
i
was
following
intersected
and
joined
the
stock
route
and
against
the
background
of
a
a
mile
ahead
i
saw
some
when
i
overtook
them
they
had
stopped
for
dinner
among
the
trees
one
of
the
party
was
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
and
three
others
were
acquaintances
so
without
any
of
the
ceremony
which
prevails
in
more
refined
circles
i
hooked
fancy
rein
on
a
pine
branch
pulled
the
off
bunyip
and
sat
down
with
the
rest
to
screen
the
tea
through
my
teeth
and
flick
the
diligent
little
operatives
out
of
the
cold
mutton
with
the
point
of
my
there
were
five
altogether
thompson
twenty
cooper
eighteen
dixon
eighteen
and
price
two
teams
of
fourteen
each
three
of
the
wagons
in
accordance
with
a
fashion
of
the
day
bore
names
painted
along
the
board
inside
the
guard
irons
thompson
was
the
wanderer
cooper
the
hawkesbury
and
dixon
the
wombat
all
were
platform
wagons
except
cooper
which
was
the
pattern
to
avoid
the
vulgarity
of
ushering
this
company
into
the
presence
of
the
punctilious
reader
without
even
the
ceremony
of
a
bedouin
introduction
this
is
my
friend
n
or
m
if
he
steals
anything
i
will
be
responsible
for
it
a
form
of
introduction
by
the
way
too
sweeping
in
its
suretyship
for
prudent
men
to
use
in
riverina
i
shall
describe
the
group
severally
with
such
succinctness
as
may
be
compatible
with
my
somewhat
discursive
style
steve
thompson
was
a
victorian
he
was
scarcely
a
typical
bullock
driver
since
fifteen
years
of
that
occupation
had
not
brutalised
his
temper
nor
ensanguined
his
vocabulary
nor
frayed
the
terminal
g
from
his
participles
i
knew
him
well
for
we
had
been
partners
in
dogflesh
and
colleagues
in
larceny
when
we
were
as
poets
feign
nearer
to
heaven
than
in
maturer
life
and
wide
as
riverina
is
we
often
encountered
fortuitously
and
were
always
glad
to
fraternise
physically
thompson
was
tall
and
lazy
as
bullock
drivers
ought
to
be
cooper
was
an
entire
stranger
to
me
but
as
he
stoutly
contended
that
hay
and
deniliquin
were
in
port
phillip
i
inferred
him
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
mother
colony
four
months
before
he
had
happened
to
strike
the
very
first
consignment
of
goods
delivered
at
nyngan
by
rail
for
the
western
country
he
had
chanced
seven
tons
of
this
for
kenilworth
had
there
met
thompson
delivering
salt
from
hay
and
now
the
two
freighted
with
kenilworth
wool
were
making
the
trip
to
hay
together
kenilworth
was
on
the
commercial
divide
having
a
choice
of
two
evils
the
long
uninviting
track
southward
to
the
murrumbidgee
and
the
badly
watered
route
eastward
to
the
bogan
this
was
cooper
first
experience
of
riverina
and
he
swore
in
no
apprentice
style
that
it
would
be
his
last
a
correlative
proof
of
the
honest
fellow
eastern
extraction
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
was
three
inches
taller
three
stone
heavier
and
thirty
degrees
lazier
than
thompson
i
had
known
dixon
for
many
years
he
was
a
magnificent
specimen
of
crude
humanity
strong
lithe
graceful
and
not
too
big
just
such
a
man
as
your
novelist
would
picture
as
the
offspring
of
some
rotund
or
ricketty
aristocrat
but
being
for
my
own
part
as
i
plainly
stated
at
the
outset
incapable
of
such
romancing
i
must
register
dixon
as
one
whose
ignoble
blood
had
crept
through
scoundrels
since
the
flood
though
when
you
come
to
look
at
it
leisurely
this
would
interfere
with
aristocratic
or
even
regal
descent
rather
the
reverse
old
price
had
carted
goods
from
melbourne
to
bendigo
in
a
hundred
miles
for
per
ton
he
had
had
two
teams
at
that
time
and
being
a
man
of
prudence
and
sagacity
had
two
teams
still
and
was
able
to
pay
his
way
i
had
known
him
since
i
was
about
the
height
of
this
table
he
was
old
price
then
he
is
old
price
still
and
he
will
probably
be
old
price
when
my
head
is
dredged
with
the
white
flour
of
a
blameless
life
and
i
am
pottering
about
with
a
stick
hating
young
fellows
and
making
myself
generally
disagreeable
price
second
team
was
driven
by
his
son
mosey
a
tight
little
fellow
whose
body
was
about
but
whose
head
according
to
the
ancient
adage
had
worn
out
many
a
good
pair
of
shoulders
willoughby
who
was
travelling
loose
with
thompson
and
cooper
was
a
whaler
not
owing
to
any
inherent
incapacity
for
he
had
taken
his
at
an
english
university
and
was
notwithstanding
his
rags
and
dirt
a
remarkably
man
bearing
a
striking
resemblance
to
dixon
even
in
features
but
as
the
wives
of
napoleon
generals
could
never
learn
to
walk
on
a
carpet
so
the
aimless
popinjay
of
adult
age
can
never
learn
to
take
a
man
place
among
workers
even
in
spite
of
willoughby
personal
resemblance
to
dixon
there
was
a
suggestion
of
latent
physical
force
and
leathery
durability
in
the
bullock
driver
altogether
lacking
in
the
whaler
and
equiponderated
only
by
a
certain
air
of
refinement
how
could
it
be
otherwise
willoughby
of
course
had
no
horse
in
fact
like
bassanio
all
the
wealth
he
had
ran
in
his
veins
he
was
a
gentleman
well
for
the
world
if
all
representatives
of
his
order
were
as
harmless
as
inexpensive
and
as
unobtrusive
as
this
poor
fellow
now
situated
like
that
most
capricious
poet
honest
ovid
among
the
goths
one
generally
feels
a
sort
of
diffidence
in
introducing
one
self
but
i
may
remark
that
i
was
at
that
time
a
government
official
of
the
ninth
class
paid
rather
according
to
my
grade
than
my
merit
and
not
by
any
means
in
proportion
to
the
loafing
i
had
to
do
candidly
i
was
only
a
but
with
the
reversion
of
the
itself
when
it
should
please
atropos
to
snip
the
thread
of
my
superior
officer
the
repast
being
concluded
the
drivers
went
into
committee
on
the
subject
of
grass
a
vital
question
in
as
you
may
remember
it
this
way
said
mosey
imperatively
and
deftly
weaving
into
his
address
the
thin
red
line
of
puissant
adjective
you
dunno
what
you
when
you
foolin
with
this
run
she
at
the
best
o
times
an
she
on
full
cock
this
year

watched

on

whatever
way
you
take
it

middlin

be
collared
in

an
we
jist
as
safe
to
be
collared
in
the
choice
between
the
divil
an
the
dam
an
there
too
big
a
township
o
wagons
together
two
enough
an
three
a
glutton
for
sich
a
season
as
this
i
think
cooper
and
i
had
better
push
on
to
the
suggested
thompson
you
three
can
work
on
the
selection
division
of
labour
the
secret
of
success
they
say
secret
of
england
greatness
mused
dixon
i
forgit
what
the
irrelevant
expletive
that
is
the
true
secret
of
england
greatness
lies
in
her
dependencies
dixon
replied
willoughby
handsomely
and
straightway
the
serene
appreciative
expression
of
the
bullock
driver
face
rightly
interpreted
showed
that
his
mind
was
engaged
in
a
conflict
with
the
polysyllable
the
latter
being
uppermost
well
no
said
mosey
replying
to
thompson
no
use
separatin
now
it
spreadin
the
risk
we
should
separated
yesterday
i
would
misdoubt
the
selection
cunningham
told
me
the
other
day
magomery
shiftin
somebody
to
live
there
if
that
so
it
up
a
tree
straight
the
always
a
risk
too
near
the
station
the
hut
on
the
selection
was
empty
a
week
ago
i
remarked
i
know
it
for
i
camped
there
one
night
good
grass
inquired
a
chorus
of
voices
about
the
best
i
had
this
season
we
chance
the
selection
said
mosey
decidedly
somebody
can
ride
on
ahead
an
see
the
coast
clear
but
they
wo
watch
a
bit
of
a
paddick
in
the
thick
o
the
shearin
when
there
nobody
livin
in
it
squatters
hed
orter
fine
grass
wool
teams
an
glad
o
the
chance
observed
price
with
unprintable
emphasis
lot
of
sense
in
that
remark
commented
mosey
with
a
similar
potency
of
adjective
well
this
is
about
the
last
place
god
made
growled
cooper
the
crimson
thread
of
kinship
running
conspicuously
through
his
observation
notwithstanding
its
narrow
provinciality
roll
up
port
phillipers
the
sydney
man
goin
to
strike
a
match
retorted
mosey
i
wonder
what
fetched
a
feller
like
you
bad
i
swear
we
did
want
no
lessons
cooper
was
too
lazy
to
reply
and
we
smoked
dreamily
while
my
kangaroo
dog
silently
abstracted
a
boiled
leg
of
mutton
from
price
tuckerbox
and
carried
it
out
of
sight
all
eyes
converged
on
a
shapeless
streak
which
had
moved
into
sight
in
the
restless
glassy
glitter
of
the
plain
about
a
mile
away
warrigal
alf
going
out
on
the
lower
track
remarked
thompson
at
length
he
was
coming
behind
baxter
and
donovan
yesterday
but
he
stopped
opposite
the
station
talking
to
montgomery
and
martin
and
the
other
fellows
lost
the
run
of
him
i
wonder
where
he
camped
last
night
he
ought
to
be
able
to
tell
us
where
the
safest
grass
is
considering
he
had
a
load
in
from
the
station
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
in
favour
of
the
if
we
caught
there
we
most
likely
only
get
insulted
and
we
can
stand
a
lot
of
that
but
if
we
caught
in
the
selection
it
about
seven
years
then
we
can
make
the
lignum
swamp
from
the
and
we
ca
make
it
from
the
selection
so
i
think
we
better
be
moving
it
be
dark
enough
before
we
unyoke
i
worked
on
that
so
often
that
i
seem
to
have
a
sort
of
title
to
it
but
there
lots
o
changes
since
you
was
here
last
said
mosey
magomery
he
beginnin
to
think
he
got
a
sort
o
title
to
the
now
considerin
it
all
purchased
tell
you
what
i
do
i
slip
over
in
two
minits
on
valiparaiser
an
consult
with

thick
as

go
with

mosey
said
i
i
got
some
messages
for
him

an
eye
on
my
dog
steve
mosey
untied
the
fine
upstanding
grey
horse
from
the
rear
of
his
wagon
i
hitched
bunyip
to
a
tree
and
mounted
fancy
and
we
cantered
away
together
across
the
plain
the
ponderous
empty
wagon
pattern
with
eight
bullocks
in
yoke
and
twelve
travelling
loose
coming
more
clearly
into
detail
through
the
vibrating
translucence
of
the
lower
atmosphere
alf
did
deign
to
stop
i
noticed
a
sinister
smile
on
his
sad
stern
face
as
mosey
gaily
accosted
him
an
how
the
world
usin
you
alf
got

them
out

shot

with
a
shade
less
of
moroseness
in
his
tone

to

said
mosey
pleasantly
and
we
turned
our
horses
and
rode
away
beggar
that
he
continued
he
floggin
the
cat
now
he
laid
us
on
to
the
selection
in
spite
of
his
self
if
that
feller
do
go
to
the
bottomless
for
his
disagreeableness
there
somethin
wrong
about
providence
i
a
great
believer
in
providence
myself
tom
an
what
more
i
try
to
live
up
to
my
adj
religion
i
sure
i
do
want
to
see
any
pore
fellow
chained
up
in
fire
an
brimstone
for
millions
o
millions
o
years
an
a
worm
tormentin
him
besides
but
i
do
see
what
the
adj
sheol

they
can
do
with
alf
awful
to

mosey
sighed
piously
then
resumed
grand
dog
you
got
since
i
seen
you
last
found
the
animal
i
no
mosey
bought
him
fair
jist
so
jist
so
you
ought
to
give
him
to
me
he
bound
to
pick
up
a
bait
with
you
you
sich
a
careless
and
so
the
conversation
ran
on
the
subject
of
dogs
during
the
return
ride
on
our
reaching
the
wagons
it
was
unanimously
resolved
that
the
selection
should
be
patronised
this
being
so
there
was
no
hurry
rather
the
reverse
for
the
selection
was
not
to
be
reached
till
dusk
you
will
understand
that
the
bullock
drivers
choice
of
accommodation
lay
between
the
selection
the
and
a
perisher
on
the
plain
the
selection
was
four
or
five
miles
ahead
the
near
corner
of
the
about
two
miles
farther
still
whilst
a
perisher
on
the
plain
is
seldom
hard
to
find
in
a
bad
season
when
the
country
is
stocked
for
good
seasons
runnymede
home
station
mooney
and
montgomery
owners
montgomery
managing
partner
was
a
mile
or
so
beyond
the
further
corner
of
the
and
was
the
central
source
of
danger
presently
the
tea
leaves
were
thrown
out
of
the
billies
the
tuckerboxes
were
packed
on
the
and
the
teams
got
under
way
thompson
pressed
me
to
camp
with
him
and
cooper
for
the
night
and
i
readily
consented
thus
temporarily
eluding
a
fatality
which
was
in
the
habit
of
driving
me
from
any
given
direction
to
runnymede
homestead
a
fatality
which
i
trust
i
shall
have
no
farther
occasion
to
notice
in
these
pages
we
therefore
tied
fancy
beside
thompson
horse
at
the
rear
of
his
wagon
and
disposed
bunyip
and
load
on
the
top
of
the
wool
the
horse
of
course
following
fancy
according
to
his
daily
habit
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
stiff
pulling
through
the
sand
of
the
and
the
plain
opened
out
again
a
short
dark
irregular
line
cleanly
separated
from
the
horizon
by
the
wavy
glassiness
of
the
lower
air
indicated
the
clump
of
box
on
the
selection
four
miles
ahead
and
this
comprised
the
landscape
soon
we
became
aware
of
two
teams
coming
to
meet
us
then
three
horsemen
behind
emerging
from
the
we
had
left
as
the
horsemen
gradually
decreased
their
distance
the
teams
met
and
passed
us
without
salutation
sullenly
drawing
off
the
track
in
the
deference
always
conceded
to
wool
victorian
poverty
spoke
in
every
detail
of
the
working
plant
victorian
energy
and
greed
in
the
unmerciful
loads
of
salt
and
wire
for
the
scrub
country
out
back
the
victorian
carrier
formidable
by
his
lack
of
professional
etiquette
and
his
extreme
thrift
is
neither
admired
nor
caressed
by
the
somewhat
select
practitioners
of
riverina
then
the
three
horsemen
overtook
cooper
pausing
a
little
after
the
custom
of
the
country
to
gossip
with
him
as
they
passed
according
to
another
custom
of
the
country
thompson
willoughby
and
i
began
to
criticise
them
i
know
the
bloke
with
the
linen
coat
remarked
thompson
his
name
he
a
contractor
that
has
been
with
him
for
years
tailing
horses
and
so
forth
for
his
tucker
and
rags
mac
no
great
chop
he
lets
his
man
friday
have
the
best
horse
at
all
events
said
i
beast
that
black
one
the
is
riding
by
jove
yes
replied
willoughby
now
thompson
referring
to
the
discussion
we
had
this
morning
that
is
the
class
of
horse
we
mount
in
our
light
cavalry
and
that
strapping
galoot
riding
the
bag
of
bones
beside
him
is
what
you
would
call
excellent
i
suggested
precisely
collins
replied
the
whaler
nature
produces
such
men
expressly
for
rank
and
file
and
i
should
imagine
that
their
existence
furnishes
sufficient
rejoinder
to
the
levelling
theory
quite
possible
the
chap
as
good
as
either
of
you
remarked
thompson
seizing
the
opportunity
for
reproof
do
you
know
anything
against
him
well
to
quote
madame
de
staël
replied
willoughby
he
abuses
a
man
privilege
of
being
ugly
moreover
he
has
left
undone
a
thing
that
he
ought
to
have
done
i
rejoined
he
ought
to
be
taking
a
spell
of
carrying
that
mare
and
pat
he
comes
like
the
catastrophe
of
the
old
comedy
chaps
said
rufus
as
he
joined
us
keep
on
your
pins
you
beggar
and
he
drove
both
spurs
into
his
mare
shrinking
flanks
grey
mare
belongs
to
you
boss
do
she
an
the
black
moke
with
the
roman
nose
follerin
i
was
thinkin
we
might
manage
to
knock
up
some
sort
o
swap
now
this
mare
a
patriarch
she
is
and
you
might
think
it
i
won
this
here
saddle
with
her
at
a
bit
of
a
meetin
las
week
an
rode
her
my
own
self
an
demonster
i
tell
you
if
this
here
mare
had
a
week
spell
you
could
hold
her
an
she
go
a
hundred
mile
between
sunrise
an
sunset
at
the
same
bat
yes
boss
it
the
breed
does
it
i
seen
some
good
horses
about
the
king
but
swelp
me
gawd
i
never
seen
a
patch
on
this
mare
an
you
might
think
it
to
look
at
her
jist
now
fact
is
boss
she
wants
a
week
or
a
fortnit
spell
could
we
work
up
some
sort
o
swap
for
that
ole
black
moke
o
yours
with
the
big
head
if
i
got
a
trifle
o
cash
to
boot
i
would
mind
slingin
in
this
saddle
an
takin
yours
now
boss
do
be
a
adj
fool
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
replied
that
black
horse
has
carried
a
pack
so
long
that
he
about
cooked
for
saddle
but
he
does
me
right
enough
then
i

exclaimed
rufus
impulsively
look
here
at
a
word
i
go
you
an
even
swap
for
that
little
weed
of
a
grey
mare
at
a
word
mind
i
a
reckless
sort
o
person
when
i
take
the
notion

without
a

of
exaggeration
i
would
do
it

fur

some
time
afther
he
had
been
travelling
with
the
fellow
and
the
fascination
of
swapping
was
upon
him
poorly
backed
by
his
suicidal
candour
the
utter
simplicity
of
his
bracketing
his
own
two
horses
worth
respectively
to
all
appearance
and
and
the
frank
confession
of
his
desire
to
have
my
mare
at
any
price
made
me
feel
honestly
compunctious
now

an
undertone
perfect
to
the
eye
murmured
thompson
try
him
a
mile
full
tilt
i
made
the
proposal
to
and
he
eagerly
agreed
at
my
suggestion
the
unhitched
and
tried
fancy
while
i
mounted
the
black
horse
and
turned
him
across
the
plain
i
tried
him
at
all
paces
but
never
before
had
i
met
with
anything
to
equal
that
elastic
step
and
long
easy
powerful
stride
to
ride
that
horse
was
to
feel
free
exultant
invincible
his
gallop
was
like
marching
through
georgia
vigorously
rendered
by
a
good
brass
band
all
that
has
been
written
of
man
noblest
friend
from
the
dim
uncertain
time
when
some
unknown
hand
in
a
leisure
moment
dashed
off
the
chapter
of
the
book
of
job
to
the
yesterday
when
long
gordon
translated
into
ringing
verse
the
rhythmic
clatter
of
the
he
loved
so
well
all
might
find
fulfilment
in
this
unvalued
beast
now
providentially
owned
by
the
softest
of
foreigners
well
interrogated
as
i
rejoined
him

i
asked
in

with
a

which
did
honour
to
my

ye
aff
we
two
notes
but
after
five
minutes
more
palaver
agreed
to
an
even
swap
i
had
pen
and
ink
in
my
pocket
my
supplied
paper
and
receipts
were
soon
exchanged
then
the
saddles
were
shifted
and
we
cantered
ahead
till
we
rejoined
thompson
i
tied
my
new
acquisition
behind
the
wagon
where
for
the
first
five
minutes
he
severely
tested
the
inch
rope
which
secured
him
now
said
i
i
give
you
my
word
that
the
mare
is
just
what
you
see
you
may
as
well
tell
me
what
wrong
with
the
horse
ax
billy
about

mebbe

foun
out
some

somethin

said
billy
devoutly
i
hope
gord
strike
me
stark
stiff
stone
dead
off
o
this
saddle
if
the
horse
has
any
tricks
or
anythin
wrong
with
him
no
more
nor
the
man
in
the
moon
onna

there
i
swore

i
replied
affably
i
should
be
sorry
to
change
it
and
i
never
did
change
it
though
often
afterward
men
of
clerkly
attainments
took
me
aside
and
kindly
pointed
out
what
they
conceived
to
be
a
blunder
i
have
dwelt
perhaps
tediously
upon
this
swap
my
excuses
are
first
that
having
made
few
such
good
bargains
during
the
days
of
my
vanity
the
memory
is
a
pleasant
one
and
second
that
the
horse
will
necessarily
play
a
certain
part
in
these
memoirs

suggested
thompson
evading
the

without
replying
the
contractor
put
his
horse
into
a
canter
and
accompanied
by
his
esquire
went
on
his
way
pausing
only
to
speak
to

likely
he
conjectured
whilst
finding
something
of
interest
on
the
horizon
at
the
side
farthest
from
me
native
o
that
district
i
am
jist
comin
across
for
the
fust
time
what
that
bloke
name
with
the
nex
team
ahead
if
it
a
fair
question
bob
dixon
gosh
i
in
luck
he
spurred
his
mare
forward
and
attached
himself
to
dixon
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
but
time
according
to
its
deplorable
habit
had
been
passing
and
the
glitter
had
died
off
the
plain
as
the
sun
went
on
its
way
to
make
a
futile
attempt
at
purifying
the
atmosphere
of
europe
at
last
we
reached
the
spot
selected
as
a
camp
close
on
our
left
was
the
clump
of
swamp
box
which
covered
about
fifty
acres
of
the
nearer
portion
of
the
selection
leaving
a
few
scattered
trees
outside
the
fence
on
our
right
the
bare
plain
extended
indefinitely
i
ought
to
explain
that
this
selection
was
a
block
which
had
been
taken
up
four
years
previously
by
a
business
man
of
melbourne
whose
aim
was
to
show
the
public
how
to
graze
scientifically
on
a
small
area
now
runnymede
owned
the
selection
whilst
its
former
occupier
was
vending
sixpenny
parcels
of
inferior
fruit
on
a
railway
platform
the
fence
erected
by
the
experimentalist
was
of
the
best
kind
two
rails
and
four
wires
and
the
wagons
drew
off
the
track
and
stopped
beside
the
fence
in
the
deepening
twilight
the
bullocks
were
unyoked
with
all
speed
and
stood
around
waiting
to
see
what
provision
would
be
made
for
the
night
look
said
mosey
taking
a
dead
pine
sapling
from
the
stock
of
firewood
under
his
wagon
and
of
course
emphasising
his
address
by
an
easy
and
not
ungraceful
clatter
of
the
adjective
used
so
largely
by
poets
in
denunciation
of
war
we
ai
goin
to
travel

from

of

o

up

no

the
mare
had
had
enough
for
one
day
she
stumbled
and
fell
rolling
heavily
over
her
rider
what
the
quadruple
expletive
the
matter
with
her
he
continued
extricating
himself
and
kicking
the
beast
till
she
staggered
to
her
feet
come
on
agen
an
do
gim
me
no
more
o
your
religiousness
he
remounted
and
the
mare
under
the
strong
stimulus
of
his
spurs
cantered
laboriously
out
into
the
dark
meanwhile
mosey
had
taken
a
from
its
receptacle
on
his
wagon
and
had
cut
the
pine
spar
to
a
length
of
about
eighteen
inches
less
than
a
panel
of
the
fence
lash
this
saplin
hard
down
on
the
top
rail
he
now
commanded
price
and
dixon
obeyed
and
mosey
laid
his
powerful
bottlejack
on
the
rail
filling
up
the
space
and
began
to
turn
it
with
a
long
bolt
by
way
of
lever
you
see
tom
he
remarked
to
me
this
fixter
put
the
crooked
maginnis
on
any

from

to
it
got
to
come
no

they
spring

an
if
every

a

why
then
ten
posts
makes
five
or
six
inches
an
that
about
all
you
want
then
in
the
mornin
you
can
fix
the
fence
so
the
divil
his
self
could
ball
you
out
ah
that
what
comes
o
blowin
for
the

being
wild
and

burst

running
completely
off

when

he
continued
removing
the
screwjack
accidents
will
happen
best
famblies
our
business
anyhow
now
chaps
round
up
yer
carrion
an
shove
in
the
four
wires
in
the
lower
part
of
the
fence
rung
like
harp
strings
as
the
cattle
stepped
into
or
over
them
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
whole
live
stock
of
the
bullocks
and
seven
horses
were
in
the
selection
but
too
thirsty
to
feed
then
whilst
thompson
mosey
willoughby
and
i
tailed
them
toward
the
tank
dixon
hurried
on
ahead
with
his
in
order
to
replenish
it
before
the
water
was
disturbed
and
price
by
mosey
orders
accompanied
him
on
the
same
business
we
steadied
the
bullocks
at
the
tank
till
all
were
satisfied
then
headed
them
back
to
within
fifty
yards
of
the
wagons
where
we
hobbled
all
the
horses
except
bum
mare
steve
said
i
to
my
old
schoolmate
of
course
you
and
i
are
seized
of
the
true
inwardness
of
duffing
but
to
those
who
live
cleanly
as
noblemen
should
this
would
appear
a
dirty
transaction
the
world
full
of
dirty
transactions
tom
replied
the
bullock
driver
wearily
it
a
dirty
transaction
to
round
up
a
man
team
in
a
paddock
and
stick
a
bob
a
head
on
them
but
that
a
thing
that
i
very
familiar
with
it
a
dirty
transaction
to
refuse
water
to
perishing
beasts
but
i
been
refused
times
out
of
number
and
will
be
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
it
a
dirty
transaction
to
persecute
men
for
having
no
occupation
but
carting
yet
that
what
of
the
squatters
do
and
this
montgomery
is
one
of
the
nine
you
a
bit
sarcastic
how
long
is
it
since
you
were
one
of
the
cheekiest
on
the
track
never
steve
you
been
drinking
anyway
you
need
be
more
of
a
hypocrite
than
you
can
help
grumbled
thompson
if
you
want
a
problem
to
work
out
just
consider
that
god
constructed
cattle
for
living
on
grass
and
the
grass
for
them
to
live
on
and
that
last
night
and
and
night
and
mostly
every
night
we
a
choice
between
two
dirty
transactions
one
is
to
let
the
bullocks
starve
and
the
other
is
to
steal
grass
for
them
for
my
own
part
i
sick
and
tired
of
studying
why
some
people
should
be
in
a
position
where
they
have
to
go
out
of
their
way
to
do
wrong
and
other
people
are
cornered
to
that
extent
that
they
ca
live
without
doing
wrong
and
ca
suicide
without
jumping
out
of
the
into
the
fire
wonder
if
any
allowance
is
made
for
bullock
drivers
or
are
they
supposed
to
be
able
to
make
enough
money
to
retire
into
some
decent
life
before
they
die
well
thank
god
for
one
good
camp
at
all
events
how
the
water
asked
cooper
meeting
us
at
the
fence
enough
for
replied
thompson
but
very
little
left
for
posterity
after
us
the
deluge
observed
willoughby
i
hope
so
replied
cooper
devoutly
lord
knows
it
badly
wanted
and
i
sure
we
do
grudge
nobody
the
benefit
turnin
out
nice
an
cool
ai
it
the
bullocks
be
able
to
do
their
selves
some
sort
o
justice
it
was
a
clear
but
moonless
night
the
dark
blue
canopy
spangled
with
myriad
stars
grandeur
peace
and
purity
above
squalor
worry
and
profanity
below
fit
basis
for
many
an
ancient
system
of
theology
unscientific
if
you
will
but
by
no
means
contemptible
price
and
cooper
being
cooks
had
kindled
an
unobtrusive
fire
in
a
crabhole
where
three
billies
were
soon
boiling
and
the
tea
when
cool
enough
needed
no
light
to
escort
a
due
proportion
of
simple
provender
into
that
mysterious
laboratory
which
should
never
be
considered
too
curiously
after
supper
we
lay
around
resting
ourselves
everyone
smoking
tranquilly
except
willoughby
dixon
and
bum
were
evidently
old
friends
they
reclined
with
their
heads
together
occasionally
laughing
and
whispering
a
piece
of
bad
manners
silently
but
strongly
resented
by
the
rest
of
the
company
i
jist
go
an
have
a
squint
at
the
carrion
remarked
mosey
at
length
with
the
inevitable
adjective
and
passing
through
the
broken
fence
he
disappeared
in
the
timber
and
wants
some
o
the
flashness
took
outen
him
remarked
price
in
arrogant
assertion
of
parental
authority
yet
glancing
apprehensively
after
mosey
as
he
spoke
should
thought
about
that
before
observed
cooper
gravely
too
late
now
you
ai
good
enough
a
few
minutes
silence
ensued
while
each
member
of
the
company
thought
the
matter
over
in
his
own
way
then
mosey
returned
grass
up
over
yer
boots
an
the
carrion
goin
into
it
lemons
he
remarked
i
do
like
to
give
this
runnymede

ropeable
when
he
sees

to
do
his
dirty
work
but
he
like
to
nip
every
divil
of
us
if
he
got
half
a
slant
i
notice
the
more
swellisher
a
man
is
the
more
miserabler
he
is
about
a
bite
o

for
a

or
a

thompson

we
found

away
in
the
sedan
paddock
certainly
we
camped
them
all

in
the
connelly
paddock
but
we
never
touched

and
we
left
no

mosey
flippantly
o
what
a
adj
lie
echoed
dixon
bum
and
the
precentor
himself
thompson
sighed
cooper
growled
and
willoughby
coughed
deprecatingly
i
do
blame
ole
martin
to
have
a
bit
of
a
nose
on
me
continued
mosey
laughingly
lord

comin
down
from

same
time

agen
five
bob
pilot

an
whenever
he
seen
a

he
swim

an
the
whole
fraternity
stringin
after
thinkin
he

grand
leader
but
a

goin
up
nyther
he
manage
to
collar
six
ton
do
mention
that
name
if
you
can
help

mosey
interrupted
cooper
as
he
returned
to
the
group
carrying
a
blanket
and
the
little
bag
of
dead
grass
which
he
used
as
a
pillow
i
a
man
he
continued
in
sullen
apology
but
it
gives
me
the
wilds
and
the
melancholies
does
that
name
which
bargoona

this

roused
from
a
reverie
by
the
magic
dissyllable
fine

he
was
flyblowed

did
want
to
part
with
him
an
me
as
thin
as

with
the
dodger
every
night
to
keep
him
from
goin
overland
to
the
bounds
o
creation
well
at
long
an
at
last
we
swapped
level
for
valiparaiser
i
seen
the
workin
o
providence
in
it
from
fust
to
last
the
horse
he
worth
twenty
notes
all
out
an

you
be

o
grass
says
he
you

says
he
the

asked
thompson
of
course
you
do

tellin
the
truth

you

a

blind
side
o
the
he
do
me
well
enough
for
poking
about
i
replied
modestly
but
how
did
the
other
fellow
get
on
with
pilot
it
was
the
fun
o
the
world
resumed
mosey
the
other
feller
he
left
the
shed
three
days
ahead
of
us
an
when
we
drawed
out
an
camped
at
the
tank
this
feller
wagon
was
standin
there
yet
an
no
sign
o
him
nor
his
carrion
i
was
thinkin
he
have
some
fun
with
pilot
on
account
of
havin
to
do
his
on
foot
for
he
could
afford
to
git
another
horse
till
he
delivered
well
i
never
seen
him
agen
till
when
we
stopped
for
dinner
but
the
feller
at
the
bilby
well
he
told
me
about
it
when
we
was
goin
back
to
bargoona
nex
trip
seems
the
other
feller
he
goes
out
in
the
mornin
on
foot
thinkin
to
fine
his
carrion
among
that
mulgar
in
the
corner
to
yer
left
an
when
he
got
to
the
corner
there
was
a
hole
in
the
fence
an
the
tracks
through
course
he
runs
the
tracks
he
runs
all
day
an
at
night
he
lays
down
an
i
he
swears
his
self
to
sleep
nex
mornin
off
he
scoots
agen
an
jist
before
sundown
he
hears
the
bells
an
he
pipes
the
tail
end
o
the
string
ahead
an
the
front
end
was
jist
at
the
bilby
well
sixty
good
mile
if
it
an
inch
an
scrub
all
the
road
pilot
he
had
thought
worth
while
to
go
by
the
boundary
tank
to
git
on
the
wool
track
he
jist
went
ahead
like
a
surveyor
an
the
fences
was
like
spiders
webs
to
him
it
was
blazing
hot
weather
and
the
other
fellow
he
never
seen
tucker
nor
water
all
the
trip
for
he
would
leave
the
track
laugh
lord
i
thought
i
busted
when
the
bloke
at
the
well
told
me
i
noticed
the
other
feller
was
a
bit
narked
when
he
seen
me
on
the
horse
he
got
red
o
pilot
look
here
mosey
said
thompson
slowly
i
rather
so
help
me
god
i
rather
cut
my
own
throat
than
do
a
trick
like
that
are
you
frightened
of
bringing
a
curse
on
yourself
i
ai
adj
fool
enough
to
believe
in
curses
replied
mosey
his
altered
tone
nevertheless
belying
his
bravado
simply
because
you
do
keep
your
eyes
open
retorted
thompson
is
it
well
known
that
a
money
never
gets
to
his
children
is
it
well
known
that
if
you
mislead
a
woman
a
curse
follow
you
like
your
shadow
is
it
well
known
that
if
you
disobedient
to
your
parents
something
happen
to
you
is
it
well
known
that
brings
a
curse
on
a
man
that
he
ca
shake
off
till
he
reforms
now
you
stole
that
horse
in
the
dirtiest
way
and
stealing
well
anything
except
grass
or
water
brings
as
heavy
a
curse
as
anything
you
can
do
mark
my
words
the
jackdaw
of
rheims
is
a
case
in
point
remarked
willoughby
aside
to
me
well
said
price
emphatically
and
qualifying
every
word
that
would
bear
qualification
so
fur
as
workin
on
sundays
goes
i
well
sure
i
allus
worked
on
sundays
an
i
well
sure
i
allus
will
an
i
well
sure
ai
no
cuss
on
me
why
i
dunno
what
the
complicated
expletive
a
cuss
is
i
get
a
blanket
fer
to
lay
on
he
added
this
ground
sorter
damp
and
he
went
across
to
his
wagon
he
got
a
curse
on
him
as
big
as
mount
macedon
and
he
does
know
it
muttered
thompson
bearing
out
the
prophecy
said
i
aside
to
willoughby
that
the
sinner
being
a
hundred
years
old
shall
be
accursed
you
ought
to
show
him
a
bit
more
respect
mosey
remarked
cooper
gravely
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
replied
mosey
frankly
i
got
no
patience
with
the
ole
bunyip
ca
suffer
fools
no
road
well
i
do
want
to
be
shovin
in
my
jor
but
i
take
him
to
be
more
rogue
than
fool
suggested
bum
time
he
was
thinkin
about
repentin
anyhow
observed
dixon
now
really
thompson
do
you
believe
in
these
special
malisons
asked
willoughby
as
price
rejoined
the
company
are
you
so
superstitious
i
should
have
thought
it
i
good
reason
to
believe
in
them
replied
thompson
you
asked
me
this
morning
why
i
did
have
two
teams
now
i
tell
you
the
reason
it
because
i
not
allowed
to
keep
two
teams
i
got
a
curse
on
me
many
a
long
year
ago
when
i
finished
my
second
season
i
found
myself
at
moama
with
a
hundred
and
ten
notes
to
the
good
and
the
prospect
of
going
straight
ahead
like
the
cube
root
or
the
square
of
the
hypotenuse
is
it
i
forget
the
exact
term
but
no
matter
well
the
curse
came
on
me
in
this
way
charley
webber
the
young
fellow
i
was
travelling
with
got
a
letter
from
some
relations
in
new
zealand
advising
him
to
settle
there
so
he
offered
me
his
plant
for
of
its
value
fifty
notes
down
and
fifty
more
when
he
would
send
for
it
sheer
of
him
for
he
knew
he
could
have
the
lot
if
he
liked
but
there
not
many
fellows
of
charley
stamp
so
i
paid
him
the
fifty
notes
and
we
parted
he
was
to
send
me
his
address
as
soon
as
he
reached
new
zealand
but
he
never
got
there
the
vessel
was
wrecked
on
some
place
they
call
the
north
spit
and
charley
was
one
of
the
missing
never
heard
of
him
from
that
day
to
this
good
ensanguined
shot
remarked
mosey
i
wish
that
same
specie
of
a
curse
would
come
on
me
my
ensanguined
colonial
assented
dixon
and
bum
with
one
accord
well
nobody
knows
anything
about
the
geography
of
new
zealand
continued
thompson
and
i
purposely
forgot
the
address
of
charley
people
any
honest
man
would
have
hunted
them
up
but
that
was
my
style
i
was
a
i
was
a
tare
compromised
with
my
conscience
thought
there
was
no
time
to
lose
in
making
an
independence
making
haste
to
be
rich
and
considering
not
that
there
many
a
slip
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
as
solomon
puts
it
i
said
to
myself
all
right
i
pay
it
some
time
now
see
the
consequence
just
two
years
after
i
bid
the
poor
fellow
years
to
the
very
day
and
not
very
lucky
years
neither
i
found
myself
in
the
middle
of
the
death
track
with
flour
for
wilcannia
one
wagon
left
behind
and
the
bullocks
dropping
off
like
fish
out
of
water
bullocks
worth
ten
notes
going
as
if
they
were
worth
it
was
like
the
retreat
from
moscow
finally
i
lost
fourteen
on
the
trip
exactly
the
number
i
had
got
dishonestly
as
for
the
second
wagon
i
gave
it
to
baxter
for
fetching
the
load
the
last
fifty
mile
i
thought
this
might
clear
away
the
curse
so
i
did
fret
over
it
i
felt
as
if
charley
had
got
satisfaction
but
i
was
going
to
get
off
so
cheap
two
years
afterward
you
remember
dixon
i
bought
that
thin
team
and
the
melbourne
wagon
from
pribble
the
contractor
dixon
here
was
driving
for
pribble
at
that
very
time
and
he
can
tell
you
how
dick
the
devil
cleaned
me
out
of
my
fine
old
picked
team
and
the
new
wagon
leaving
me
to
begin
afresh
with
the
remains
of
pribble
skeletons
and
my
own
old
wagon
then
a
year
or
two
afterward
i
went
in
debt
to
buy
that
plant
of
mulligan
him
that
was
killed
off
the
colt
at
mossgiel
and
that
same
winter
the
pleuro
broke
out
in
my
lot
and
they
went
like
rotten
sheep
till
fourteen
were
gone
and
then
of
course
the
plague
was
stopped
not
having
any
use
for
mulligan
wagon
i
swapped
her
for
a
new
and
a
wagga
pot
good
for
eight
or
ten
mile
on
a
still
night
and
within
a
month
ramsay
punt
went
down
with
my
wagon
she
in
the
bottom
of
the
murrumbidgee
now
with
eight
ton
of
bricks
to
steady
her
and
the
tarpaulin
and
bell
to
keep
her
company
she
be
fetching
the
most
critical
planks
out
of
a
steamer
some
of
these
times
and
i
get
seven
years
for
leaving
her
there
afterward
when
i
was
hauling
logs
for
pontooning
on
the
goulburn
i
kept
buying
up
steers
and
breaking
them
in
till
i
had
two
twelves
and
one
day
i
left
sixteen
of
them
standing
in
yoke
while
i
went
looking
round
for
a
good
log
and
suddenly
i
heard
a
crash
that
rattled
back
and
forward
across
the
river
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
had
a
presentiment
that
providence
was
on
the
job
again
and
i
was
disappointed
one
of
the
fallers
had
left
a
tree
nearly
through
when
he
went
to
dinner
and
a
gust
of
wind
sent
it
over
and
it
carried
a
couple
of
other
trees
before
it
right
on
the
spot
where
my
team
was
folded
up
in
the
shade
eight
of
them
went
that
trip
between
killed
and
crippled
leaving
me
with
sixteen
my
next
piece
of
luck
was
to
lose
that
new
yankee
wagon
in
the
mallee
on
birrawong
then
i
could
see
plain
enough
that
providence
had
taken
up
charley
case
and
was
prepared
to
block
me
of
keeping
two
teams
so
i
determined
to
have
one
good
one
now
i
always
stood
pretty
well
with
the
agents
and
squatters
and
i
know
my
way
round
riverina
so
i
can
turn
over
as
much
money
as
any
man
on
the
track
bar
warrigal
alf
i
beg
your
pardon
cooper
i
forgot
but
what
the
use
of
money
to
me
only
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
as
shakespear
says
i
get
up
to
a
certain
point
and
then
i
knocked
stiff
mind
i
only
given
you
a
small
insignificant
sample
of
the
misfortunes
i
had
since
i
cheated
that
dead
man
but
if
they
do
prove
there
a
curse
on
me
then
there
no
such
thing
as
proof
in
this
world
price
cleared
his
throat
them
misforcunes
was
invidiously
to
yer
own
adj
misjudgment
he
said
dogmatically
serve
you
right
for
not
havin
better
luck
added
dixon
learn
you
sense
anyhow
remarked
mosey
misforcunes
does
some
people
good
hazarded
bum
yes
replied
thompson
gently
i
had
my
turn
i
hope
i
take
it
like
a
man
your
turns
will
come
sooner
or
later
as
sure
as
you
got
heads
on
your
bodies
perhaps
next
year
perhaps
next
week
perhaps
let
see
how
you
take
it
mind
there
a
curse
on
every
one
of
us
and
look
here
we
had
no
business
to
travel
there
was
a
bite
of
feed
in
the
patagonia
swamp
if
it
came
to
the
worst
now
we
in
for
it
i
got
a
presentiment
that
something
happen
before
night
just
mark
my
words
a
constrained
silence
fell
on
the
children
till
willoughby
politely
sought
to
restore
ease
by
contributing
his
quota
to
the
evening
feast
of
reason
there
occurs
to
my
mind
a
capital
thing
he
said
a
capital
thing
indeed
though
apropos
of
nothing
in
particular
a
student
returning
from
a
stroll
encountered
a
countryman
carrying
a
hare
in
his
hand
said
the
student
quietly
that
thine
own
hare
or
a
wig
the
joke
of
course
lies
in
the
play
on
the
word
willoughby
courteous
effort
was
worse
than
wasted
for
the
general
depression
deepened
you
right
thompson
said
cooper
at
length
mostly
everybody
got
a
curse
on
them
i
got
a
curse
on
me
i
got
it
through
and
i
tried
to
knock
off
swearin
fifty
dozen
times
but
i
might
as
well
try
to
fly
last
time
i
tried
to
knock
it
off
was
when
i
left
nyngan
for
kenilworth
four
months
ago
but
there
happened
to
be
a
bag
o
rice
in
the
bottom
o
the
load
an
something
tore
her
an
she
started
leakin
through
the
cracks
in
the
floor
o
the
wagon
an
i
could
git
at
her
no
road
for
there
was
seven
ton
on
top
of
her
an
the
blasted
stuff
it
kep
till
you
could
tracked
me
at
a
gallop
for
over
a
hundred
mile
an
me
swearin
at
it
till
i
was
black
in
the
face
an
it
always
stopped
dribblin
at
night
like
as
if
it
was
to
aggravate
a
man
if
it
had
been
for
that
rice
i
kep
from
swearin
that
trip
an
then
comin
down
from
kenilworth
with
thompson
i
kep
from
it
easy
for
thompson
he
never
swears
i
give
him
credit
for
that
much
i
do
claim
any
credit
remarked
thompson
with
the
unconscious
spiritual
swagger
which
so
often
antecedes
and
possibly
generates
lapse
i
never
could
see
that
swearing
did
any
good
so
i
just
say
to
myself
like
to
come
out
would
you
well
then
once
for
all
you
wo
you
a
happy
man
curse
and
all
replied
the
giant
gloomily
for
my
own
part
i
was
brought
up
careful
but
i
turned
out
a
adj
failure
nobody
would
think
seeing
me
so
brisk
an
cheerful
that
i
got
more
worry
nor
anybody
myself
could
stand
i
got
more
trouble
nor
all
you
fellers
put
together
he
paused
evidently
battling
feebly
with
that
impulse
which
bids
us
ease
the
loaded
breast
even
when
discovery
pain
his
voice
was
even
lower
and
sadder
as
he
resumed
my
father
he
was
well
off
with
a
comfortable
place
of
his
own
on
the
hawkesbury
an
there
was
me
an
my
sister
molly
for
my
mother
died
of
a
cold
she
caught
when
i
was
about
twelve

about
after

the

of
it

growed
up
to
be
the
best
girl
an
the
cleverest
in
the
district
the
other
girls
was
weeds
aside
of

she
was
a
picter
to
look
at
strong
as
whalebone
she
was
an
not
a
lazy
bone
in
her
body
she
was
different
from
me
in
regard
o
learnin
for
she
always
liked
to
have
her
nose
in
a
book
an
she
went
a
lot
to

an
my

he
sent
her
to
sydney
for
over
a
year
o
purpose
to
fetch
her
out
peanner
or
flute
or
fiddle
or
the
curliest
instrument
out
of
a
brass
band
it
was
all
one
to
her
it
come
sort
o
natural
to
her
to
fetch
music
out
of
anything
pore
molly
cooper
paused
awhile
before
he
resumed
she
never
took
up
with
none
o
the
fellers
i
knowed
fellers
try
to
kiss
her
but
her
style
was
to
stiffen
them
with
a
clip
under
the
ear
an
they
sort
o
took
the
hint
an
never
come
back
but
a
man
from
the
queensland
border
he
bought
the
place
next
ours
but
one
an
our
two
got
acquainted
wonderful
clever
ole
feller
he
was
in
regard
o
findin
out
new
gases
an
smells
an
cures
for
an
stuff
that
would
go
off
like
a
cannon
if
you
looked
at
it
this
cove
had
got
one
son
an
two
daughters
an
his
missis
was
sickly
well
the
son
he
was
a
young
chap
about
my
own
age
at
the
time
an
how
old
was
you
then
demanded
mosey
about
he
seemed
to
be
a
fine
straightforrid
young
feller
an
me
an
him
we
soon
got
great
cronies
an
i
seen
he
was
collared
on
molly
an
she
was
collared
on
him
well
thank
god
he
got
a
curse
on
him
that
he
wo
get
rid
of
in
a
hurry
thank
god
for
that
much
ruined
her
queried
mosey
briskly
cooper
passed
the
question
with
unconscious
dignity
and
resumed
things
went
on
this
way
for
a
couple
o
year
an
this
feller
people
was
agreeable
an
to
make
a
long
story
short
the
time
was
fixed
for
two
months
on
ahead
your
father
was
agreeable
of
course
said
thompson
he
was
dead
replied
cooper
reverently
gone
to
eternity
i
hope
he
deserved
to
go
there
if
ever
any
livin
man
did
he
died
about
a
year
after
these
people
come
to
settle
near
our
place
what
was
the
young
feller
name
queried
mosey
never
you
mind
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
one
day
pore
molly
wanted
to
go
somewhere
an
she
jumped
a
horse
i
just
left
in
the
yard
an
she
shoved
her
foot
in
the
an
the
horse
he
was
a
devil
an
he
played
up
with
her
in
the
yard
an
her
heel
went
through
the
loop
o
the
leather
an
she
come
off
an
hung
by
her
ankle
an
the
horse
he
was
shod
all
round
an
he
kicked
her
in
the
face
cooper
paused
killed
her
suggested
mosey
i
caught
the
horse
an
got
her
clear
an
carried
her
into
the
house
all
covered
with
blood
an
just
like
a
corp
an
i
left
her
there
with
the
married
woman
we
had
while
i
went
for
the
doctor
well
there
she
laid
for
weeks
between
dead
an
alive
an
me
like
a
feller
in
a
dream
thinkin
an
thinkin
an
not
able
to
anything
but
the
hammerin
i
used
to
give
her
an
the
things
i
used
to
take
off
of
her
an
set
her
cryin
i
would
go
through
that
lot
agen
not
if
i
got
a
pension
for
it
well
she
got
her
senses
complete
an
this
young
feller
he
had
been
hangin
about
the
house
every
day
sayin
nothing
to
nobody
but
when
she
begun
to
come
round
he
begun
away
at
last
she
was
all
right
in
regard
o
health
but
she
was
disfigured
for
life
she
had
to
wear
a
crape
veil
down
to
her
mouth
then
the
young
feller
he
used
to
come
sometimes
an
just
shake
hands
with
her
but
otherways
he
would
touch
her
with
a
pole
then
he
begun
to
stop
away
altogether
an
he
suddenly
got
married
to
a
girl
out
o
the
lowest
pub
for
ten
mile
round
an
his
father
real
decent
ole
bloke
he
was
he
told
him
never
to
show
his
face
about
the
place
agen
but
there
was
no
end
o
go
in
him
he
had
an
uncle
in
sydney
middlin
rich
a
an
this
what
a
demanded
mosey
a
man
that
supplies
candles
to
ships
i
replied
this
uncle
he
had
a
left
on
his
hands
out
somewhere
south
an
he
give
the
to
the
young
feller
on
sort
o
an
i
believe
he
got
on
splendid
for
a
couple
or
three
year
an
his
wife
had
one
picaninny
so
we
come
to
hear
an
suddenly
he
balled
her
out
with
some
other
feller
i
got
hearsay
for
it
mind
but
i
know
it
true
for
it
just
what
ought
to
happen
anyhow
the
hand
of
god
was
on
him
an
he
got
it
hot
an
heavy
accordin
to
accounts
he
sold
out
an
give
her
the
bulk
o
the
cash
an
then
he
travelled
last
year
out
on
the
namoi
a
man
told
me
he
seen
him
bullock
drivin
in
the
bland
country
seven
year
ago
it
might
be
him
or
it
might
i
do
know
an
i
do
want
to
know
for
he
done
all
the
harm
he
could
i
got
to
thank
him
for
all
my
troubles
for
him
i
been
livin
comfortable
in
the
ole
spot
still
i
do
mention
these
things
not
once
every
three
year
on
a
average
but
sometimes
when
you
think
i
pleasant
an
cheerful
i
fair
wild
with
thinkin
about
that
blasted
cur
an
you
chaps
fetched
him
up
fresh
in
my
mind
and
the
poor
girl
is
she
still
at
home
asked
thompson
no
replied
cooper
hoarsely
she
somewhere
at
the
bottom
o
the
hawkesbury
river
an
there
no
more
home
about
three
or
four
year
after
her
accident
i
was
away
in
sydney
one
time
on
some
business
about
shares
an
when
i
come
home
molly
was
gone
she
left
a
letter
for
me
sayin
she
nothing
to
live
for
an
we
meet
on
the
other
side
o
the
grave
an
i
must
always
think
kind
of
her
an
to
remember
ole
times
when
there
was
the
two
of
us
an
prayin
god
to
bless
me
for
always
bein
good
to
her
why
it
knocked
me
stiff
for
i
always
been
a
selfish
unfeelin
he
stopped
abruptly
he
had
uttered
the
last
sentences
only
by
a
strong
effort
presently
dixon
pitying
his
emotion
remarked
to
thompson
in
a
gratuitously
lively
tone
and
with
diction
too
florid
for
exact
reproduction
say
was
i
tellin
you
i
seen
that
white
bullock
you
swapped
to
cartwright
las
year
i
think
he
gittin
a
cancer
mebbe
it
blight
i
would
say
an
that
lyin
individual
ike
cunningham
told
me
he
busted
his
self
with
trefile
jist
after
cartwright
got
him
ah
replied
thompson
absently
what
become
o
yer
place
asked
mosey
turning
to
cooper
i
answer
that
question
but
not
to
satisfy
you
replied
cooper
coldly
well
chaps
when
pore
molly
day
was
fixed
i
scraped
up
a
hundred
notes
an
borrered
two
hundred
on
the
place
to
give
her
a
start
when
the
thing
took
place
my
ole
dad
he
left
everything
to
me
with
strict
orders
to
see
molly
through
he
did
want
to
make
her
a
bait
for
loafers
well
when
the
thing
was
squashed
me
like
a
fool
i
was
advised
to
lay
the
money
out
in
minin
shares
for
molly
an
then
i
kep
risin
more
money
an
buyin
more
shares
an
i
got
sort
o
muddled
somehow
an
to
make
a
long
story
short
the
whole
adj
thing
went
to
sheol
it
was
goin
that
road
when
i
seen
the
last
o
pore
molly
an
when
i
lost
her
i
jist
roused
round
an
got
a
team
together
an
signed
everything
the
lyin
cheatin
financiers
told
me
to
sign
an
then
i
cleared
off
must
be
gittin
on
for
let
see
molly
was
when
she
got
her
accident
an
it
was
three
year
after
when
she
made
away
with
herself
that
was
nine
year
ago
so
she
be
if
she
was
alive
now
she
need
done
it
o
she
should
done
it
for
she
the
satisfaction
o
knowin
the
curse
that
come
on
that
blasted
dog
i
told
her
all
the
particulars
i
got
thinkin
to
satisfy
her
but
i
believe
it
done
her
harm
for
the
end
come
a
week
or
ten
days
after
seems
strange
lookin
back
at
it
to
think
how
simple
our
been
broke
up
an
my
old
home
gone
into
the
hands
o
strangers
never
got
a
trace
of
your
sister
asked
thompson
not
a
trace
some
people
would
have
it
she
was
gone
to
america
or
california
or
somewhere
but
why
would
she
go
me
an
the
ryans
that
was
the
married
couple
we
had
we
knowed
most
about
it
an
we
cared
most
an
we
was
sure
from
the
first
though
we
done
everything
that
could
be
done
she
went
away
at
night
an
took
nothing
with
her
not
a
single
item
o
clothes
but
jist
as
she
stood
ah
i
give
what
little
i
got
an
walk
a
thousand
mile
on
to
the
back
of
it
to
see
her
pore
bones
buried
safe
an
then
i
be
satisfied
cooper
sighed
deeply
and
lit
his
pipe
then
for
a
time
the
utter
stillness
of
the
bright
starlight
was
broken
only
by
the
faint
jingle
of
the
horses
and
the
sound
of
some
of
the
nearer
bullocks
cropping
the
luxuriant
grass
the
a
fool
to
this
spot
remarked
mosey
at
length
mind
you
it
was
friendly
of
number
two
to
lay
us
on
decent
thing
i
ever
knowed
him
to
do
he
ai
the
clean
spud
he
certainly
observed
thompson
but
i
ca
help
taking
an
interest
in
him
as
a
general
rule
the
more
uncivilised
a
man
is
till
you
come
right
down
to
the
level
of
the
blackfellow
the
better
bushman
he
is
but
i
must
say
this
of
thingamybob
that
he
comes
as
near
the
blackfellow
hold
on
interrupted
dixon
whose
private
conversation
with
bum
had
caused
him
to
lose
step
in
the
march
of
conversation
who
the
sheol
is
this
thingamybob
bar
sells
i
wish
somebody
would
fetch
me
a
drink
of
water
replied
thompson
dropping
his
subject
in
pointed
rebuke
of
dixon
behaviour
i
rather
perish
than
go
for
it
myself
and
i
wo
live
two
hours
if
i
do
get
it
it
cooper
fault
when
he
keeps
the
meat
fresh
it
walks
away
and
when
he
packs
it
in
salt
and
then
roasts
it
in
the
pan
like
this
evening
you
can
see
the
salt
all
over
it
like
frost
grand
remedy
for
scurvy
and
barcoo
rot
and
the
hundreds
of
natural
diseases
that
flesh
is
subject
to
as
the
poet
says
that
adj
liar
growled
cooper
with
a
fairly
successful
attempt
at
easy
an
i
as
bad
off
as
him
an
there
ai
a
whimper
out
o
me
i
bring
a
drink
for
you
both
said
i
rising
and
taking
two
pannikins
from
the
lid
of
the
i
would
do
it
only
that
i
famishing
myself
and
i
tired
of
waiting
for
some
one
else
to
give
in
then
whilst
helping
myself
to
a
drink
from
the
under
the
rear
of
thompson
wagon
and
filling
the
pannikins
for
my
friends
i
could
possibly
avoid
overhearing
the
conversation
which
sprang
into
life
the
moment
my
back
was
turned
my
lord
remarked
mosey
wonder
why
the
sheol
he
ai
at
runnymede
doin
the
amiable
with
mother
bodysark
bright
pair
them
two
would
trust
him
as
fur
i
could
sling
him
said
dixon
too
thick
with
the
adj
squatters
for
my
fancy
a
man
never
knows
what
game
that
bloke
up
to
ca
make
him
out
no
road
confessed
cooper
seems
a
decent
sort
o
feller
but
i
swear
there
more
in
his
head
nor
a
comb
take
out
he
calls
himself
a
philosopher
murmured
thompson
but
his
philosophy
mostly
consists
in
thinking
he
knows
everything
and
other
people
know
nothing
that
the
principal
point
i
seen
in
him
and
we
been
acquainted
since
we
were
about
that
high
it
was
always
his
way
who
this
mother
bodysark
if
it
a
fair
question
asked
cooper
beaudesart
corrected
thompson
she
a
widow
woman
sort
of
cousin
to
montgomery
and
housekeeper
at
the
station
i
never
heard
of
anybody
grudging
her
to
collins
between
ourselves
thompson
remarked
willoughby
his
conversation
this
afternoon
rather
amused
me
it
recalled
to
my
mind
an
excellent
and
most
characteristic
pleasantry
which
you
may
not
have
heard
the
story
goes
that
coleridge
once
asked
lamb
you
ever
hear
me
preach
said
lamb
i
never
heard
you
do
anything
else
and
yet
if
collins
had
enjoyed
the
advantages
accruing
from
even
the
rudiments
of
a
liberal
ed
he
got
summick
to
do
with
lately
said
price
cunningly
my
he
shadderin
summedy
he
ai
a
gurl
o
that
sort
interposed
bum
hastily
my
he
a
spieler
no
more
a
detective
nor
i
am
i
returned
to
the
group
my
friends
drained
their
pannikins
thompson
threw
his
at
the
and
cooper
was
just
aiming
his
when
willoughby
who
had
shared
the
frosted
mutton
interposed
if
you
please
cooper
seen
better
days
pore
fellow
observed
cooper
sympathetically
as
the
ripple
of
the
water
into
the
pannikin
indicated
that
the
whaler
was
at
the
tap
ca
see
much
worse
mused
thompson
my
adj
oath
ca
he
chuckled
mosey
hold
on
till
he
gits
old
people
seem
to
think
gawd
made
these

colonies
for
a
said
bum
that
the
english
idear
of
stiddy
charley
interrupted
dixon
everybody
got
a
right
to
live
an
that
pore
fellow
got
jist
as
much
right
as
me
or
you
a
man
ought
to
show
respect
to
misforcune
charley

for
any
of
you
gentlemen
asked
willoughby
without
a
trace
of
ironical
emphasis
on
the
last
word
fetch
me
one
while
yer
hand
in
replied
bum
willoughby
brought
the
drink
i
fancied
even
an
accession
to
the
subdued
suavity
of
his
manner
as
he
picked
up
and
replaced
on
the
tuckerbox
the
empty
pannikin
which
bum
had
thanklessly
tossed
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
then
he
resumed
his
place
and
thompson
palpably
turning
his
back
on
dixon
and
bum
selected
him
as
chief
hearer
of
his
recommenced
discourse
comes
as
near
the
blackfellow
as
it
possible
for
a
white
man
to
get
and
you
could
kill
him
with
an
axe
then
start
him
at
any
civilised
work
such
as
splicing
a
loop
on
a
wool
rope
or
making
a
yoke
or
wedging
a
loose
box
in
a
wheel
and
he
has
the
best
hands
in
the
country
at
the
same
time
it
plain
to
be
seen
that
he
has
been
brought
up
in
the
class
of
society
that
sticks
a
napkin
in
a
bone
ring
alongside
your
plate
at
dinner
here
thompson
paused
and
the
recurrence
of
some
distressing
memory
elicited
a
sigh
there
is
nothing
unreasonable
in
that
phenomenon
remarked
willoughby
rather
the
reverse
probably
the
person
you
speak
of
is
a
gentleman
now
the
man
who
is
a
gentleman
by
birth
and
culture
by
which
i
mean
a
man
of
good
family
who
has
not
only
gone
through
the
curriculum
of
a
university
but
has
graduated
so
to
speak
in
society
such
a
one
has
every
advantage
in
any
conceivable
situation
the
records
of
military
enterprise
exploration
pioneering
and
so
forth
furnish
abundant
evidence
of
this
very
obvious
fact
you
will
find
i
think
that
high
breeding
and
training
are
conditions
of
superiority
in
the
human
as
well
as
in
the
equine
and
canine
races
pedigree
being
of
course
the
primary
desideratum
non
generant
aquilae
columbas
we
say
do
run
away
with
the
idear
that
nobody
knows
who
columbus
was
retorted
bum
he
discovered
america
or
else
my
readin
did
me
adj
little
good
more
power
to
yer

bum
said
mosey
approvingly
but

or
no

if
a

ai
propped
up
with

this
country
adj
quick
fetch
him
to
his
proper
adj
level
pardon
me
if
i
differ
from
you
mosey
replied
willoughby
blandly
a
few
months
ago
i
travelled
the
lachlan
with
a
man
fitted
by
birth
and
culture
to
be
a
leader
of
society
one
whose
rightful
place
would
be
at
least
in
the
front
rank
of
your
australian
aristocracy
how
do
you
account
for
such
a
man
being
reduced
to
solicit
the
demd
pannikin
of
flour
easy
retorted
the
sansculotte
the
duke
had
jist
settled
down
to
his
proper
adj
level
like
the
bloke
you
see
in
the
bottom
of
a
new
pannikin
when
you
drinkin
out
of
it
mosey
said
cooper
impressively
if
i
git
up
off
o
this
blanket
i

i
did
catch
the
rest
of
the

here
you

sneered
mosey
with
the
usual
flowers
of
speech
an
that
about
all
you
can
git
muttered
cooper
faithfully
following
the
same
ornate
style
of
diction
now
mosey
said
willoughby
courteously
but
tenaciously
will
you
permit
me
to
enumerate
a
few
gentlemen
gentlemen
remember
who
have
exhibited
in
a
marked
degree
the
qualities
of
the
pioneer
let
us
begin
with
those
men
of
whom
you
victorians
are
so
justly
proud
burke
and
wills
then
you
have
hold
on

on

mosey
do
go
no

yer
knockin
yerself
bad
an
you
do

it
wills
was
a
pore
harmless

so
he
kin

but
there
ai
a
drover
nor
yet
a
bullock
driver
nor
yet
a
from
to
that
could
bossed
that
expegition
straight
through
to
the
gulf
an
back
agen
an
never
turned
a
hair
with
sich
a
season
as
burke
had
do
sicken
a
man
with
yer
burke
he
burked
that
expegition
right
enough
grand
style
o
man
for
sich
a
contract
i
tell
you
that
explorer
died
for
want
of
his
sherry
an
biscakes
why
the
ole
man
here
seen
him
out
beyond
menindie
with
his
pardon
me
mosey
was
price
connected
with
the
expedition
no
adj
fear
growled
price
resentfully
jist
happened
to
be
there
with
the
adj
teams
went
up
with
stores
an
come
down
with
wool
willoughby
who
probably
had
wept
over
the
sufferings
of
burke
party
on
their
way
to
menindie
seemed
badly
nonplussed
he
murmured
acquiescence
in
price
authority
and
mosey
continued
well
the
ole
man
here
seen
him
camped
with
his
carpet
an
his
bedsteed
an
sheol
knows
what
paravinalia
an
a
man
nothin
to

but
wait
on

an

here
a
cubbard
made
to

o

as
true
as
i
a
livin
sinner
one
o
the
compartments
made
distinctly
o
purpose
to
hold
his
belltopper
quite
so
replied
willoughby
approvingly
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
burke
had
a
position
to
uphold
in
the
party
and
that
to
maintain
subordination
a
commander
must
differentiate
himself
by
it
gord
truth
anyhow
remarked
price
rousing
his
mind
from
a
retrospect
of
its
extensive
past
and
no
doubt
the
old
man
was
right
for
a
relic
answering
to
mosey
description
was
sold
by
auction
in
melbourne
with
other
assets
of
the
expedition
upon
brahe
return
they
give
him
a
lot
o
credit
for
dyin
in
the
open
continued
the
practical
little
wretch
with
masterly
handling
of
expletive
but
i
want
to
know
what
else
a
feller
like
him
could
do
when
there
was
no
git
out
an
you
see
in
there
a
statue
of
him
made
o
cast
steel
or
concrete
or
somethin
standin
as
bold
as
brass
in
the
middle
o
the
street
my
word
an
all
the
thousands
o
pore
beggars
that
died
o
thirst
an
hardship
in
the
back
country
all
o
them
a
dash
sight
better
men
nor
burke
knowed
how
to
be
where
theyre
statutes
do
talk
rubbage
to
me
why
there
was
no
end
to
that
feller
childishness
before
he
leaves
bray
at
cooper
creek
he
drors
out
what
do
you
think
well
he
drors
out
a
plan
o
forti
adj
fications
like
they
got
in
ole
countries
an
bray
had
to
keep
his
fellers
workin
an
at
this
thing
till
the
time
come
for
them
to
clear
an
mind
you
this
was
among
the
tamest
blackfellers
in
the
world
why
burke
was
dotin
wants
a
young
feller
with
some
life
in
him
for
to
boss
a
expegition
on
top
o
burke
swellishness
an
uselessness
dash
me
if
he
was
forty
well
no
he
war
too
old
mosey
interposed
price
deprecatingly
wants
a
experienced
man
fer
sich
work
same
time
you
could
best
burke
fer
a
counterfit
thing
you
never
hear
one
good
word
o
that
man
observed
cooper
different
from
all
the
other
explorers
ca
account
for
it
no
road
another
singular
thing
is
that
you
never
read
a
word
against
him
added
thompson
in
conversation
you
always
learn
that
burke
never
did
a
thing
worth
doing
or
said
a
thing
worth
saying
and
that
his
management
of
that
expedition
would
have
disgraced
a
schoolboy
and
old
victorian
policemen
will
tell
you
that
he
left
the
force
with
the
name
of
a
bully
and
a
snob
and
a
man
of
the
smallest
brains
wonder
why
these
things
never
get
into
print
de
mortuis
nil
nisi
bonum
is
an
excellent
maxim
thompson
remarked
willoughby
it
is
that
retorted
mosey
divil
a
fear
but
they
nicely
bone
in
the
shape
o
credit
toffs
is
no
slouches
at
for
theyre
own
push
an
i
tell
you
another
dash
good
maximum
it
to
keep
off
of
weltin
a
dyin
man
did
you
ever
read
burke
diary
willoughby
asked
thompson
it
just
two
or
three
pages
of
the
foolishest
trash
that
any
man
ever
lost
time
in
writing
and
i
afraid
it
about
a
fair
sample
of
burke
i
wish
you
could
talk
to
some
fellows
that
i
know
barefooted
bob
for
instance
now
there
a
man
that
was
never
known
to
say
a
thing
that
he
was
sure
of
and
he
been
all
over
the
country
that
burke
was
over
and
heard
all
that
is
to
be
known
of
the
expedition
and
bob
a
man
that
goes
with
his
eyes
open
i
wish
you
could
talk
to
him
lots
of
information
in
the
back
country
that
never
gets
down
here
into
civilisation
there
is
a
certain
justice
in
mosey
contention
i
remarked
addressing
willoughby
he
argues
that
as
burke
by
dying
of
hardship
earned
himself
a
statue
so
brown
jones
and
robinson
whose
souls
we
trust
are
in
a
less
torrid
climate
than
their
unburied
bones
should
in
bare
justice
have
similar
recognition
for
burke
sake
of
course
the
comparison
in
value
of
service
had
better
not
be
entered
on
mosey
would
have
our
cities
resemble
ancient
athens
in
respect
of
having
more
public
statues
than
living
citizens
your
allusion
to
athens
is
singularly
happy
replied
the
whaler
but
you
will
remember
that
the
athenians
were
in
many
respects
as
exclusive
as
ourselves
the
impassable
chasm
which
separates
your
illustrious
explorer
from
brown
jones
and
robinson
existed
also
in
athens
though
perhaps
not
so
jealously
guarded
but
let
us
change
the
subject
yes
do
said
cooper
cordially
i
hate
argyin
fust
go
off
it
all
friendly
my
good
man
my
dear
feller
run
away
with
that
idear
puttin
the
boot
on
the
wrong
foot
got
the
wrong
pig
by
the
tail
an
so
on
as
sweet
as
sugar
but
it
sheol
with
you
for
a
adj
fool
a
adj
liar
the
adj
sheol
do
you
think
you
talking
to
an
one
word
fetchin
on
another
till
it
grows
into
a
sort
o
unpleasantness
hear
anything
of
bob
and
bat
lately
asked
thompson
after
a
pause
both
gone
to
have
a
confab
with
burke
an
good
enough
for
the
likes
o
them
replied
mosey
them
sort
o
varmin
the
curse
o
the
country
i
ai
a
very
honorable
sort
myself
but
i
go
on
one
feed
every
two
days
before
i
come
as
low
as
them
well
couple
or
three
year
ago
you
know
ole
he
sent
the
adj
skunks
out
with
cattle
to
some
new
country
a
hundred
mile
beyond
sheol
an
between
hardship
an
bad
tucker
an
bad
conscience
they
both
pegged
out
so
a
feller
from
the
diamantinar
told
me
a
fortnit
ago
smart
fellows
in
their
way
remarked
thompson
i
do
bear
them
any
malice
though
they
rounded
me
up
twice
and
made
me
fork
out
each
time
boolka
suggested
mosey
they
grabbed
us
there
once
an
it
was
another
time
but
the
place
is
worth
a
bit
o
risk
no
both
times
it
was
on
on
the
deniliquin
side
replied
thompson
first
time
was
about
nine
years
ago
bob
and
bat
were
dummying
on
the
station
at
the
time
and
looking
after
the
skeleton
paddock
flash
young
fellers
they
were
then
cunningham
and
i
worked
on
that
paddock
one
night
as
usual
coming
up
empty
from
the
murray
of
course
we
were
out
in
the
morning
at
grey
daylight
but
it
was
a
bit
foggy
and
instead
of
finding
the
bullocks
we
found
bob
and
bat
cantering
round
looking
for
them
cunningham
and
i
separated
and
so
did
the
other
two
and
the
four
of
us
spent
the
liveliest
you
could
wish
for
chasing
and
crossing
and
meeting
one
another
in
all
directions
and
not
a
word
spoken
and
not
a
hoof
to
be
seen
at
last
the
fog
lifted
a
bit
and
cunningham
spotted
cattle
in
a
timbered
swamp
but
bat
was
between
him
and
them
so
he
circled
round
gently
and
was
edging
up
to
get
a
good
start
when
bat
took
the
alarm
and
saw
the
cattle
then
it
was
with
them
for
possession
bob
and
i
happened
to
be
in
sight
and
when
we
saw
our
mates
go
off
on
the
jump
we
both
went
for
the
same
spot
cunningham
beat
bat
by
a
few
lengths
and
got
possession
but
when
i
got
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
i
saw
there
was
only
part
of
our
lot
there
just
then
i
saw
bob
turn
his
horse
and
race
straight
toward
me
and
when
i
looked
in
the
direction
he
was
going
i
saw
more
cattle
i
went
for
them
with
a
clear
start
of
a
hundred
yards
and
would
have
won
easy
only
that
i
saw
they
were
station
cattle
and
at
the
same
time
i
caught
sight
of
another
little
lot
in
a
hollow
to
the
left
and
bat
travelling
for
them
i
slewed
round
and
gave
him
a
gallop
for
it
but
he
won
by
fifty
yards
however
there
was
only
five
of
our
lot
in
the
little
mob
there
was
thirteen
wanted
still
and
bob
had
possession
of
them
among
the
station
cattle
so
they
got
eighteen
altogether
and
we
only
got
sixteen
after
running
the
legs
off
our
horses
port
phillip
observed
cooper
pointedly
another
time
going
on
for
three
years
ago
continued
thompson
bob
had
me
as
cheap
as
dirt
for
the
whole
twenty
while
bat
snapped
potter
horses
the
same
night
that
was
on
again
shortly
before
sold
the
station
to
stoddart
and
just
before
the
two
of
them
were
sent
out
to
the
diamantina
and
stoddart
of
course
i
gently
suggested
yes
tom
i
thought
i
made
that
clear
so
you
did
steve
i
beg
pardon
do
mention
it
tom
true
friendship
lay
underneath
this
severity
for
when
thompson
got
started
on
his
reminiscences
he
was
apt
to
continue
indefinitely
to
the
ruin
of
his
own
dignity
but
why
this
solicitude
and
panic
over
being
detected
in
trifling
trespass
asked
willoughby
like
most
things
in
this
country
it
appears
to
be
purely
a
matter
of
ł
now
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
totting
up
in
my
own
mind
some
of
your
earnings
will
thompson
permit
me
to
take
his
case
as
an
illustration
i
find
thompson
that
the
tariff
of
your
wool
is
exactly
sevenpence
per
ton
per
mile
you
have
eight
tons
on
your
wagon
at
the
present
time
this
will
give
you
five
shillings
for
each
mile
you
travel
you
have
travelled
ten
miles
sabbath
day
journey
sighed
thompson
that
is
two
pounds
ten
now
all
things
considered
an
occasional
penalty
of
say
one
pound
appears
to
me
by
no
means
ruinous
it
is
not
to
be
mentioned
in
comparison
with
other
losses
which
you
have
been
unfortunate
enough
to
sustain
yet
it
appears
to
be
your
chief
grievance
yes
that
one
way
of
looking
at
it
muttered
thompson
after
a
pause
the
other
fellows
were
silently
and
futilely
wrestling
with
the
apparent
anomaly
a
metaphysical
question
keeps
slipping
away
from
the
grasp
of
the
bullock
driver
mind
like
a
wet
yet
the
solution
is
simple
the
man
is
decidedly
openhanded
he
will
submit
to
crushing
losses
with
cheerfulness
tempered
of
course
by
humility
in
those
cases
where
he
recognises
the
operation
of
an
overhanging
curse
he
will
subscribe
to
any
good
or
bad
cause
with
a
liberality
excelled
only
by
the
digger
he
will
pay
gambling
debts
with
the
easy
careless
grace
which
makes
every
of
so
popular
in
english
sporting
circles
in
a
word
the
smallest
of
his
many
sins
is
parsimony
but
the
penal
suggestiveness
of
trespass
penalty
touches
the
sullen
dignity
of
his
nature
and
the
vague
but
fear
of
a
law
made
and
administered
solely
by
his
natural
enemies
makes
him
feel
about
as
apprehensive
as
john
bunyan
though
certainly
more
dangerous
of
course
willoughby
born
and
bred
a
member
of
the
governing
class
could
easily
conceive
the
dismay
with
which
these
outlaws
regarded
legal
seizure
for
trespass
or
possibly
prosecution
in
courts
dominated
by
squatters
i

here
followed
a

torrent
of
red
vituperation
showing

a
strong
personal

in
the

with
the
two

to
my

knowledge
they
dummied
land
for

an
never

a

for

remarked
dixon

i
got
nothin
to

agen
for
they
never
got
a

to

my

brothers
ai
they
no

replied
mosey
you
never
seen
brothers
hangin
together
like
them
chaps
i
know
some
drovers
that
been
for
theyre
adj
souls
every
night
for
years
on
account
o
the
way
they
used
to
rush
travellin
stock
across
runs
whenever
there
was
dirty
work
to
be
did
them
two
blokes
was
on
hand
to
do
it
an
i
got
it
on
good
authority
that
they
chanced
three
years
chokey
for
perjury
when
they
was
dummyin
for
an
all
they
got
for
it
was
the
fright
hangin
over
them
a
man
should
make
a
dog
of
his
self
without
he
well
paid
for
it
that
my
adj
religion
so
far
as
dummying
is
concerned
said
i
no
one
except
their
maker
and
knows
how
the
thing
was
worked
but
if
they
had
owned
all
the
land
they
secured
for
by
perjury
and
personation
and
straightforward
dummyism
they
would
have
been
little
squatters
themselves
at
the
same
time
they
were
kindly
unselfish
men
according
to
their
uncertain
light
and
in
all
probability
they
gone
to
heaven
such
is
life
boys
anyhow
they
ai
goin
to
trouble
us
no
furder
rejoined
mosey
complacently
theyre
toes
is
turned
up
that
the
sound
i
like
to
hear
the
sound
was
the
deep
heavy
sough
of
a
contented
bullock
as
he
lay
down
with
a
couple
of
days
rations
in
his
capacious
first
stomach
grass
is
generally
a
burning
question
with
you
teamsters
observed
willoughby
i
never
make
no
insinuations
myself
replied
dixon
coldly
good
interjected
mosey
if
you
was
inclined
that
road
you
might
say
the
carrier
got
as
much
interest
in
the
grass
as
a
squatter
it
the
traveller
as
do
give
a

expletive
if
the

as

as

well
i
that
about

cooper
and
he
pulled
off
his

preparatory
to
wrapping
himself
in

tong
cooshey
as
the
frenchman
says
must
oversleep
in
the
mornin
if
the

safe
then
i
disposed
my
possum

and

took
off
my

spread
my
coat
for

to
sleep
on
lit
my
pipe
and
lay
down
for
the
night
thompson
mosey
and
willoughby
arranged
themselves
here
and
there
according
to
taste
dixon
and
methuselah
retired
to
hammocks
under
the
rear
of
their
respective
wagons

simply
lay
where

i
would
do
my
companions
what
honour
i
can
but
the
stern
code
of
the
chronicler
permits
no
quibbling
with
the
fact
that
mosey
and
bum
wound
up
the
evening
with
a
series
of
gestes
and
apothegms
such
as
must
not
tarnish
these
pages
willoughby
occasionally
taking
part
rather
i
think
through
courtesy
than
sympathy
and
ably
closing
the
service
with
a
fescennine
anecdote
beginning
is
related
that
on
one
occasion
the
late
marquis
of
waterford
willoughby
had
selected
a
smooth
place
near
my
own
lair
here
he
spent
five
minutes
in
spreading
his
exceptionally
dirty
blanket
and
another
five
in
tidily
folding
his
ragged
coat
for
a
pillow
then
he
removed
his
unmatched
boots
and
unlapping
from
his
feet
the
inexpensive
substitute
for
socks
known
as
he
artistically
spread
the
redolent
swaths
across
his
boots
to
receive
the
needed
benefit
of
the
night
air
performing
all
these
little
offices
with
an
unconscious
elegance
amusing
to
notice
an
elegance
which
not
another
member
of
our
party
could
have
achieved
any
more
than
willoughby
could
have
acquired
the
practical
effectiveness
of
a
good
rough
average
vulgarian
poor
shadow
of
departed
exclusiveness
lying
there
with
none
so
poor
to
do
him
reverence
he
was
a
type
and
by
reason
of
his
happy
temperament
an
exceedingly
favourable
type
of
the
shifting
for
himself
under
normal
conditions
of
life
urbane
address
faultless
syntax
even
that
good
part
which
shall
not
be
taken
away
namely
the
calm
consciousness
of
inherent
superiority
are
of
little
use
here
and
yet
your
australian
novelist
finds
no
inconsistency
in
placing
the
bookish
student
or
the
city
dandy
many
degrees
above
the
bushman
or
the
digger
or
the
pioneer
in
vocations
which
have
been
the
of
the
latter
o
the
wearisome
nonsense
of
this
kind
which
is
remorselessly
thrust
upon
a
docile
public
and
what
an
opportunity
for
some
novelist
in
his
rabid
pursuit
of
originality
to
merely
reverse
the
incongruity
picturing
a
lassoed
and
launched
into
polished
society
there
to
excel
the
fastidious
idlers
of
and
in
their
own
line
this
miracle
would
be
more
reasonable
than
its
antithesis
without
doubt
it
is
easier
to
acquire
gentlemanly
deportment
than
muscle
easier
to
criticise
an
opera
than
to
identify
a
beast
seen
casually
twelve
months
before
easier
to
dress
becomingly
than
to
make
a
straight
as
the
sighting
of
a
theodolite
across
strange
country
in
foggy
weather
easier
to
recognise
the
various
costly
vintages
than
to
live
contentedly
on
the
smell
of
an
oil
rag
when
you
take
this
back
elevation
of
the
question
the
inconsistency
becomes
apparent
and
the
longa
of
art
viewed
in
conjunction
with
the
brevis
of
life
makes
it
at
least
reasonable
that
when
a
man
has
faithfully
served
one
exclusive
apprenticeship
he
will
find
it
too
late
in
the
day
to
serve
a
second
moreover
there
are
few
advantages
in
training
which
do
not
according
to
present
social
arrangements
involve
corresponding
penalties
human
ignorance
is
after
all
more
variable
in
character
than
in
extent
each
sphere
of
life
each
occupation
is
burdened
with
its
own
special
brand
of
this
unhappy
heritage
to
remove
one
small
section
of
inborn
ignorance
is
a
for
any
man
madam
pure
ignorance
was
what
betrayed
the
great
lexicographer
into
defining
as
horse
knee
and
the
doctor
was
right
in
his
admission
of
course
not
in
his
definition
ignorance
reader
pure
ignorance
is
what
debars
you
from
conversing
fluently
and
intelligibly
in
several
dialects
of
the
chinese
language
yet
a
friend
of
mine
named
yabby
pelham
can
do
so
though
the
same
person
knows
as
little
of
as
william
shakespear
of
stratford
knew
but
if
you
had
been
brought
up
in
a
chinese
camp
on
a
your
own
special
acquirements
and
corresponding
ignorance
might
run
in
grooves
similar
to
yabby
let
each
of
us
keep
himself
behind
the
spikes
on
this
question
of
restricted
capability
and
should
some
insect
indignantly
retort
that
though
his
own
ancestors
have
borne
for
seventeen
generations
and
though
he
himself
was
brought
up
so
utterly
and
aristocratically
useless
as
to
have
been
unable
at
twenty
years
of
age
to
polish
his
own
boots
yet
he
is
now
mentally
and
physically
a
man
fit
for
anything
i
can
only
reply
in
the
words
of
portia
that
i
fear
me
my
lady
his
mother
played
false
with
a
smith
but
this
again
would
be
claiming
too
much
for
heredity
at
the
expense
of
training
remember
however
that
our
present
subject
is
not
the
of
actual
life
he
is
an
unknown
and
elusive
quantity
merging
insensibly
into
saint
or
scoundrel
sage
or
fool
man
or
blackleg
he
runs
in
all
shapes
and
in
all
degrees
of
definiteness
our
subject
is
that
insult
to
common
sense
that
childish
slap
in
the
face
of
honest
manhood
the
of
fiction
and
of
australian
fiction
heaven
knows
i
am
no
more
inclined
to
decry
social
culture
than
moral
principle
but
i
acknowledge
no
aristocracy
except
one
of
service
and
in
which
he
that
is
chief
shall
be
servant
and
he
that
is
greatest
of
all
servant
of
all
and
it
is
surely
time
to
notice
the
threepenny
braggadocio
of
caste
which
makes
the
languid
captain
vemon
de
vere
or
words
to
that
effect
an
overmatch
for
white
savages
any
one
of
whom
would
take
his
lordship
by
the
ankles
and
wipe
the
battlefield
with
his
patrician
visage
which
makes
the
pale
elegant
aristocrat
punch
beelzebub
out
of
big
mick
the
who
in
unpleasant
reality
would
feel
the
kick
of
a
horse
less
than
his
antagonist
would
the
wind
of
heaven
visiting
his
face
too
roughly
which
makes
the
darling
of
the
english
rectory
show
the
specialists
of
the
back
country
how
to
ride
a
buckjumper
which
makes
a
party
of
resourceful
bushmen
stand
helpless
in
the
presence
of
flood
or
fire
till
marshalled
by
some
hero
of
the
croquet
lawn
above
all
which
makes
the
isocratic
and
irreverent
australian
fawn
on
the
for
no
imaginable
reason
except
that
the
latter
says
instead
of
and
jove
instead
of
sheol
go
to
i
no
more
o
it
hath
made
me
mad
and
do
fall
back
upon
the
musty
subterfuge
which
by
a
shifting
value
of
the
term
represents
as
simply
signifying
a
man
of
honour
probity
education
and
taste
for
by
immemorial
usage
by
current
application
and
by
every
rule
which
gives
definite
meaning
to
words
the
man
with
a
shovel
in
his
hand
a
rule
in
his
pocket
an
axe
on
his
shoulder
a
leather
apron
on
his
abdomen
or
any
other
badge
of
manual
labour
about
him
his
virtues
else
be
they
as
pure
as
grace
as
infinite
as
man
may
undergo
is
carefully
contradistinguished
from
the
the
may
be
a
drunkard
a
gambler
a
debauchee
a
parasite
a
helpless
potterer
he
may
be
a
man
of
spotless
life
able
and
honest
but
he
must
on
no
account
be
a
man
with
broad
palms
a
workman
amongst
workmen
the
is
not
necessarily
gentle
but
he
is
necessarily
genteel
etymology
is
not
at
fault
here
gentility
and
gentility
alone
is
the
qualification
of
the
no
doubt
it
is
very
nice
to
see
a
who
when
drunk
can
lie
in
the
gutter
like
a
but
will
someone
suggest
a
more
pitiable
sight
than
such
a
person
trying
to
compete
with
an
miner
on
the
goldfields
or
with
a
hardy
bushman
in
the
back
country
in
the
back
country
a
penniless
and
friendless
if
sober
and
honest
and
possessed
of
some
little
ability
may
aspire
to
the
position
of
a
station
storekeeper
if
destitute
of
these
advantages
and
reduced
are
not
by
any
means
always
sober
honest
and
capable
the
best
thing
he
can
do
if
he
gets
the
chance
is
to
settle
down
thankfully
into
the
innocent
occupation
so
earnestly
desired
by
henry
the
sixth
of
the
play
and
so
thriftily
pursued
by
the
alleged
father
of
any
amateur
elocutionist
whose
name
is
norval
on
the
grampian
hills
of
such
reduced
it
is
often
said
that
their
education
becomes
their
curse
here
is
another
little
subterfuge
this
is
one
of
those
taking
expressions
which
are
repeated
from
parrot
to
magpie
till
they
seem
to
acquire
axiomatic
force
it
is
such
men
ignorance
their
technical
ignorance
that
is
their
curse
education
of
any
kind
never
was
and
never
can
be
a
curse
to
its
possessor
it
is
a
curse
only
to
the
person
whose
interest
lies
in
exploiting
its
possessor
erudition
even
in
the
humblest
sphere
of
life
is
the
sweetest
solace
the
unfailing
refuge
of
the
restless
mind
but
if
the
bearer
thereof
be
not
able
to
do
something
well
enough
to
make
a
living
by
it
his
education
is
simply
outclassed
overborne
and
crushed
by
his
own
superior
ignorance
to
be
sure
there
are
men
of
social
culture
who
gallantly
and
conspicuously
maintain
an
superiority
in
the
society
to
which
i
myself
hereditarily
belong
namely
the
lower
orders
but
their
appearances
are
like
angels
visits
in
the
obvious
as
well
as
in
the
conventional
but
remoter
sense
i
can
count
no
less
than
three
men
of
this
stamp
among
my
ten
thousand
acquaintances
when
the
twofold
excellence
of
such
ambidexters
is
not
stultified
by
selfishness
you
have
in
them
a
realised
ideal
upon
which
their
creator
might
pronounce
the
judgment
that
it
is
very
good
move
heaven
and
earth
then
to
multiply
that
ideal
by
the
number
of
the
population
the
thing
is
at
least
theoretically
possible
for
it
is
in
no
way
necessary
that
the
manual
worker
should
be
rude
and
illiterate
shut
out
from
his
rightful
heirship
of
all
the
ages
nor
is
it
any
more
necessary
that
the
social
aristocrat
ostentatiously
useless
as
he
generally
is
should
hold
virtual
monopoly
of
the
elegancies
of
life
but
the
commonplace
of
fiction
who
without
extraneous
advantage
and
by
mere
virtue
of
and
and
doth
bestride
this
narrow
world
like
a
colossus
i
am
sorry
to
break
in
upon
your
meditations
collins
said
willoughby
deprecatingly
turning
towards
me
on
his
elbow
but
you
know
necessitas
non
habet
leges
i
find
myself
without
the
requisite
for
my
normal
bedtime
solace
and
i
am
unusually
wakeful
could
you
spare
me
a
pipeful
of
tobacco
certainly
why
did
you
mention
it
before
i
had
no
idea
you
were
a
smoker
i
feel
really
vexed
at
your
reticence
well
thompson
kindly
lent
me
a
supply
this
morning
but
unfortunately
i
had
a
hole
in
my
pocket
that
i
was
not
aware
of
and
thanks
i
just
take
a
pipeful
no
no
shove
it
in
your
pocket
i
got
more
in
my
swag
been
long
in
these
colonies
willoughby
about
a
year
i
spent
two
months
in
melbourne
and
nearly
four
in
sydney
for
the
last
six
months
i
have
been
er
travelling
in
search
of
employment
you
find
the
colonies
pretty
rough
i
do
collins
to
speak
frankly
i
do
even
in
your
cities
i
observe
a
feverish
excitement
and
a
demnable
race
for
what
the
scriptures
aptly
call
lucre
and
the
pastoral
regions
are
well
rough
indeed
your
colonies
are
too
young
in
time
to
come
no
doubt
the
amenities
of
life
will
appear
for
you
have
some
magnificent
private
fortunes
but
in
the
meantime
one
hears
of
nothing
but
work
business
and
so
forth
cultivated
leisure
is
a
thing
practically
unknown
however
the
country
is
merely
passing
through
a
necessary
phase
of
development
in
the
near
future
each
of
these
shabby
home
stations
will
be
replaced
by
a
noble
mansion
with
its
spacious
park
and
these
bare
plains
will
reward
the
toil
of
an
industrious
and
contented
tenantry
like
sheol
sneered
mosey
from
his
a
little
crestfallen
notwithstanding
irrigation
my
dear
mosey
will
meet
the
difficulty
which
very
naturally
arises
in
your
mind
a
scientific
system
of
irrigation
would
increase
the
letting
value
of
this
land
more
than
a
now
if
the
state
would
carry
out
such
a
system
by
heaven
collins
you
would
soon
have
a
class
of
country
magnates
second
to
none
in
the
world
you
are
a
native
of
the
colonies
i
presume
yes
i
come
from
the
cabbage
garden
victoria
i
know
is
called
the
cabbage
garden
rejoined
willoughby
but
pardon
me
if
you
are
a
native
of
victoria
you
can
form
no
conception
of
what
england
is
among
the
upper
middle
classes
to
which
i
belonged
the
proclivity
is
held
in
very
low
esteem
i
assure
you
our
solicitude
is
to
make
ourselves
mutually
agreeable
and
the
natural

and
refinement
which
but
what
the

good
does
that
do
the
likes
o

fellows
demanded
mosey
impertinently
or
perhaps
i
should
say
pertinently
a
grace
and
refinement
which
if
you
will
pardon
me
for
saying
so
you
can
form
no
conception
of
inherited
wealth
is
the
secret
of
it
beg

interposed
cooper
apologetically
i
was
goin
to
say
to
collins
before
i
forgit
that
he
can
easy
git

one

a

that
his

an
there
no

over
it
good
idear
ai
it
it
is
a
good
idea
i
replied
i
glad
you
laid
me
on
to
it
but
willoughby
i
ca
help
thinking
you
must
feel
the
change
very
acutely
i
do
but
what
is
the
use
of
grumbling
ver
non
semper
viret
no
doubt
you
are
surprised
to
see
me
in
my
present
position
it
is
owing
in
the
first
place
to
a
curious
combination
of
circumstances
and
in
the
second
place
to
some
of
my
own
little
pranks
i
am
nephew
to
sir
robert
brook
baronet
the
present
representative
of
the
brooks
of
brookcotes
dorsetshire
a
family
sir
dating
from
the
fourteenth
century
possibly
you
have
heard
the
name
often
not
the
brookes
of
the
king
elms
hants
pray
observe
the
brookes
of
the
king
elms
gained
their
enormous
wealth
as
army
contractors
during
the
struggle
with
napoleon
and
their
baronetcy
heaven
knows
how
the
baronetcy
of
the
brooks
of
brookcotes
dates
from
at
which
time
my
maternal
ancestor
sir
roger
brook
knight
procured
his
patent
by
supplying
thirty
infantry
for
three
years
in
the
subjugation
of
ireland
independently
of
the
title
our
family
is
many
centuries
older
than
the
other
we
spell
our
name
without
my
adj
fambly
come
all
the
way
down
from
the
hark
observed
mosey
with
a
rudeness
which
reflected
little
credit
on
his
ancient
lineage
without
the
final
there
is
a
manifest
breach
of
trust
in
creation
of
these
new
baronetcies
it
was
more
than
implied
it
was
distinctly
stipulated
at
the
origination
of
the
order
by
james
i
that
the
number
of
baronets
should
not
exceed
two
hundred
and
that
there
should
be
no
new
creations
to
supply
the
place
of
such
titles
as
might
lapse
through
extinction
of
families
and
is
there
no
remedy
for
this
i
asked
none
whatever
not
that
i
am
personally
interested
in
the
exclusiveness
of
the
order
my
connection
with
the
brooks
of
brookcotes
being
on
the
distaff
side
my
mother
was
sir
robert
only
sister
my
father
was
a
military
man
buffs
died
when
i
was
twelve
or
thirteen
years
of
age
sir
robert
was
a
confirmed
bachelor
and
i
was
his
only
nephew
now
you
see
my
position
i
think
i
do
four
years
ago
demme
if
sir
robert
did
marry
a
manufacturer
daughter
soap
manufacturer
and
within
two
years
there
was
a
lineal
heir
to
brookcotes
you
do
say
so
fact
begad
shortly
afterward
i
was
detected
sua
cuique
voluptas
in
a
liaison
with
a
young
person
who
resided
with
my
uncle
wife
as
a
companion
whereupon
my
lady
used
her
influence
with
the
demd
old
dotard
and
i
was
cut
off
with
a
shilling
however
he
gave
me
a
saloon
passage
to
melbourne
with
an
order
on
his
agent
in
that
city
for
my
lady
father
also
gave
me
letters
of
introduction
to
some
friends
in
sydney
business
people
fact
was
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
me
the
should
have
given
you
a
fair
start
i
suggested
pardon
me
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
enter
into
the
feelings
of
a
man
who
has
been
brought
up
as
presumptive
heir
to
a
of
you
can
not
imagine
how
the
mind
of
a
gentleman
shrinks
from
the
petty
details
the
meanness
the
vulgarities
of
trade
you
are
aware
i
presume
that
all
avenues
of
ambition
except
the
church
the
army
and
the
legislature
are
closed
to
our
class
you
can
not
imagine
pardon
my
repeating
it
the
exclusiveness
the
fine
sense
of
honour
holy
sailor
i
heard
thompson
whisper
to
himself
which
pervades
the
mind
and
controls
the
actions
of
a
gentleman
as
a
casual
illustration
of
what
is
amusingly
though
somewhat
provokingly
ignored
here
you
have
no
doubt
observed
that
our
gentlemen
cricketers
will
acknowledge
no
fellowship
with
professionals
though
they
may
belong
to
the
same
team
and
be
paid
from
the
same
funds
however
to
proceed
with
a
story
which
is
perhaps
not
without
interest
i
left
melbourne
before
my
pittance
was
exhausted
and
presented
my
credentials
in
sydney
wilcox
a
relation
of
my
lady
father
and
a
person
of
some
local
importance
treated
me
at
first
with
consideration
in
fact
there
was
always
a
knife
and
fork
for
me
at
his
table
but
i
noticed
as
time
went
on
a
growing
coolness
on
his
part
i
ought
to
mention
that
his
sister
bradshaw
a
widow
fat
fair
and
forty
had
considerable
capital
invested
in
his
business
and
i
was
paying
my
addresses
to
her
deeming
my
birth
and
education
a
sufficient
counterpoise
to
her
wealth
i
have
married
her
too
begad
i
would
at
this
time
wilcox
was
establishing
gelatine
works
and
he
had
the
demd
effron
what
gelatine
demanded
mosey
i
heard
o
the
adj
stuff
what
the
sheol
is
it
used
in
in
commerce
principally
mosey
i
replied
neat
begad
as
i
was
saying
wilcox
had
the
demd
assurance
to
offer
me
a
clerkship
in
his
new
establishment
we
had
a
few
words
in
consequence
and
shortly
afterward
i
left
sydney
and
found
my
way
here
have
you
any
acquaintance
in
sydney
may
i
ask
a
word
of
explanation
being
only
an
official
of
the
ninth
class
i
received
my
appointment
in
hay
on
that
occasion
i
asked
the
magistrate
who
received
my
securities
and
otherwise
attended
to
the
matter
i
naturally
asked
him
what
chance
i
had
for
promotion
he
told
me
that
it
would
go
strictly
by
seniority
but
as
my
immediate
superior
the
was
not
eligible
for
any
higher
grade
never
having
passed
any
examination
whatever
and
as
i
could
not
be
advanced
over
his
head
my
only
chance
was
to
step
into
his
place
when
he
vacated
it
now
i
knew
he
was
not
likely
to
resign
for
he
had
a
good
salary
all
to
himself
and
nothing
to
do
but
refer
me
to
the
central
office
for
orders
i
knew
in
fact
that
there
was
only
one
way
in
which
he
was
likely
to
quit
his
niche
in
the
edifice
of
the
state
so
i
replied
to
willoughby
question
well
i
may
say
i
have
and
yet
i
not
aware
of
anyone
in
sydney
that
i
would
know
by
sight
my
superior
officer
lives
there
remotely
possible
you
may
know
him
rudolph
winterbottom
esquire
rudolph
winterbottom
did
you
say
yes
by
jove
rather
a
happy
coincidence
i
remember
him
well
i
was
introduced
to
him
on
a
reception
day
at
government
house
and
met
him
frequently
afterward
dined
in
his
company
i
think
on
two
occasions
is
he
a
very
old
man
no
the
old
gentleman
is
his
father
thomas
winterbottom
hale
sturdy
old
boy
overflowing
with
vitality
came
out
he
told
me
in
the
time
of
sir
richard
bourke
but
i
scarcely
think
rudolph
winterbottom
holds
any
government
situation
his
private
fortune
is
fully
sufficient
for
all
demands
of
even
good
society
ah
now
i
have
it
his
son
rudy
his
third
or
fourth
son
holds
some
appointment
that
will
be
your
man
very
likely
an
invalid
is
he
not
something
wrong
with
his
lungs
so
i
should
imagine
now
that
you
mention
it
he
was
away
on
an
excursion
to
the
mountains
when
his
father
spoke
of
him
to
me
git
to
sleep
chaps
for
gossake
murmured
cooper
guarantee
there
be
none
o
this
liveliness
in
the
mornin
when
you
got
to
turn
out
thus
sensibly
admonished
we
committed
ourselves
to
what
macbeth
calls
labour
bath
the
only
kind
of
bath
we
were
likely
to
have
for
some
time
among
the
thousand
natural
ills
there
are
two
to
which
i
never
have
been
and
probably
never
shall
be
subject
namely
gout
and
insomnia
my
immunity
from
the
former
might
be
difficult
to
account
for
but
my
exemption
from
the
latter
may
i
think
be
attributed
to
the
operation
of
a
mind
at
peace
with
all
below
nevertheless
it
used
to
be
my
habit
to
wake
punctually
at
for
the
purpose
of
remembering
whether
i
had
to
listen
for
bells
or
not
and
determining
how
long
i
could
afford
to
sleep
so
at
that
exact
hour
i
opened
my
eyes
to
see
the
calm
splendid
stars
above
whilst
merciful
darkness
the
sordid
accessories
of
daily
life
below
yet
i
noticed
that
the
hammock
under
the
rear
of
dixon
wagon
was
empty
all
the
other
fellows
were
sleeping
except
bum
who
seemed
to
have
disappeared
altogether
the
two
were
probably
up
to
something
no
business
of
mine
and
i
dropped
to
sleep
again
i
had
set
myself
to
wake
at
full
daylight
just
as
i
woke
i
heard
the
distant
patter
of
a
galloping
horse
such
a
sound
at
such
a
time
is
ominous
to
duffing
bullock
drivers
so
as
i
sprang
to
my
feet
you
may
be
sure
my
companions
were
not
much
behind
me
along
the
track
a
mile
in
advance
of
the
wagons
we
saw
an
approaching
horseman
and
as
if
this
was
enough
we
heard
the
sound
of
an
axe
in
the
selection
holy
glory
there
somebody
livin
in
the
hut
after
all
ejaculated
mosey
the
house
stood
on
a
very
slight
rise
where
the
clump
of
swamp
box
terminated
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
and
sure
enough
we
could
see
through
a
gap
in
the
undergrowth
of
a
man
chopping
wood
at
the
edge
of
the
clump
but
he
seemed
quite
unconscious
of
the
multitude
of
bullocks
that
scattered
all
over
the
paddock
were
laying
in
a
fresh
supply
of
grass
it
moriarty
sighed
thompson
gazing
at
the
horseman
he
been
sent
to
catch
us
it
all
up
then
like
the
sound
of
many
waters
rose
the
mingled
sentiments
of
the
company
as
each
man
dragged
on
his
boots
with
a
celerity
beyond
description
you
keep
him
on
a
string
collins
while
we
coller
as
many
of
the
carrion
as
we
what
use
it
a
summonsing
match
already
look
at
the
fence
and
martin
lives
in
the
hut
after
all
he
between
us
and
the
bullocks
now
laughing
at
us
what
business
had
we
to
travel
on
demmit
suggest
something
make
use
of
me
in
this
emergency
i
beg
of
you
shall
i
port
phillip
all
over
jist
let
me
deliver
this
adj
load
that
all
i
comes
o
young
pups
knowin
heverythink
i
kep
all
the
adj
time
are
you
fellows
mad
shouted
the
young
storekeeper
as
he
dashed
past
the
group
and
pulled
his
blown
horse
round
in
a
circle
out
with
those
bullocks
as
quick
as
the
devil
let
you
martin
on
top
of
you
i
just
given
him
the
slip
we
were
sent
from
the
station
expressly
to
nip
you
fly
round
blast
you
fly
round
at
the
word
cooper
and
thompson
snatched
up
their
bridles
and
darted
off
followed
by
price
and
willoughby
dixon
and
bum
were
not
in
the
crowd
but
no
one
had
leisure
just
then
to
notice
their
absence
len
yer
horse
like
a
good
feller
said
mosey
hastily
to
sheol
with
your
cheek
snapped
moriarty
what
next
i
wonder
mosey
snatched
up
his
bridle
and
went
off
at
a
run
hello
collins
i
did
notice
you
in
the
hurry
bright
cards
ai
they
nothing
short
of
seven
years
satisfy
them
you
been
travelling
all
night
no
i
camped
here
with
the
teams
i
thought
when
i
saw
the
saddled
horse
that
you
had
just
turned
him
in
to
get
a
bite
he
not
saddled
there
my
saddle
i
thought
that
was
your
horse
that
black
one
with
the
new
saddle
on
i
should
explain
that
moriarty
being
mounted
could
see
across
the
which
i
could
not
but
i
say
he
continued
what
do
you
mean
by
stopping
here
instead
of
making
for
the
station
i
a
dash
good
mind
to
tell
beaudesart
why
it
two
months
since
you
parted
from
her
where
martin
i
asked
i
left
him
at
the
trying
to
track
his
horse
i
suppose
you
have
heard
that
he
lives
here
now
well
we
heard
that
some
one
was
being
sent
to
live
here
by
the
way
moriarty
you
better
keep
out
of
sight
of
that
fellow
at
the
hut
no
odds
it
only
daddy
montague
he
ca
see
twenty
yards
but
i
say
beaudesart
is
sorting
out
her
own
old
wedding
toggery
she
knows
you
never
have
money
enough
to
how
does
martin
come
to
be
at
the
if
he
lives
here
i
interrupted
i
tell
you
the
whole
rigmarole
replied
the
genial
ass
martin
was
at
the
station
yesterday
crawling
after
miss
king
when
up
comes
a
hound
of
a
contractor
name
of
to
see
about
the
specifications
of
the
new
fence
between
us
and
nalrooka
and
this
fellow
idea
of
getting
on
the
soft
side
of
montgomery
about
the
fence
was
to
nearly
break
his
neck
running
to
tell
him
that
price
and
thompson
and
a
whole
swag
of
other
fellows
intended
to
work
on
the
that
night
that
would
be
last
night
of
course
now
montgomery
does
bark
about
a
night
grass
out
of
the
at
this
time
of
year
in
case
of
emergency
but
he
does
believe
in
driving
expressly
for
it
and
besides
he
badly
wants
to
catch
price
and
thompson
and
make
an
example
of
them
well
it
happened
that
he
had
thought
out
early
jobs
for
all
the
rest
of
the
fellows
so
what
does
he
do
sunday
and
all
but
he
rouses
out
martin
and
me
and
tells
us
to
go
to
the
and
quietly
round
up
all
the
bullocks
and
bring
them
to
the
station
no
hurry
of
course
so
i
got
playing
cards
with
some
of
the
shearers
and
martin
got
yarning
with
the
old
and
we
timed
ourselves
to
be
at
the
just
before
daylight
of
course
the
right
plan
would
have
been
to
go
through
the
and
in
by
the
quondong
gate
and
that
was
what
i
wanted
to
do
then
we
could
have
made
a
circuit
of
the
inside
the
fence
and
given
it
a
good
rough
overhaul
but
because
i
proposed
this
martin
insisted
on
going
by
the
main
road
for
better
riding
and
to
see
if
we
could
find
the
wagons
as
a
sort
of
guide
sensible
to
the
last
well
he
would
have
it
his
own
way
and
i
did
give
a
curse
so
on
we
went
and
just
as
we
were
crossing
the
sort
of
hollow
at
this
near
corner
of
the
the
old
fool
thought
he
heard
cattle
in
the
timber
so
we
tied
our
horses
at
the
fence
and
walked
across
to
see
nothing
there
of
course
only
imagination
and
kangaroos
we
stayed
about
ten
minutes
me
moralising
about
fools
and
him
sulking
and
when
we
came
back
to
where
we
had
left
our
horses
mine
was
there
by
himself
martin
was
dancing
mad
for
his
horse
was
never
known
to
break
a
bridle
and
he
did
know
who
to
blame
for
making
away
with
him
however
i
was
any
way
interested
in
mustering
the
and
martin
wanted
his
horse
so
we
hunted
round
and
round
but
devil
a
smell
of
horse
or
saddle
or
bridle
could
we
find
in
the
dark
after
a
while
daylight
came
and
i
caught
sight
of
the
wool
and
tumbled
to
the
little
game
of
course
i
ripped
across
to
give
the
fellows
the
office
praying
and
cursing
fit
to
break
my
neck
what
the
dickens
induced
them
to
run
the
risk
of
duffing
here
maddest
thing
i
ever
knew
martin
has
been
living
here
since
this
day
week
and
his
greatest
pleasure
in
life
is
prowling
round
when
he
ought
to
be
asleep
warrigal
alf
laid
mosey
on
i
replied
at
least
he
said
he
had
stayed
here
the
night
before
last
and
had
taken
his
bullocks
out
after
they
lay
down
ah
the
treacherous
beggar
i
tell
you
how
that
came
day
before
yesterday
let
see
that
was
saturday
montgomery
and
martin
met
alf
just
at
the
station
coming
along
behind
some
other
teams
montgomery
was
sorry
in
his
own
mind
for
a
blaggarding
he
gave
alf
last
winter
for
letting
his
bullocks
get
into
our
seems
they
got
adrift
from
bottara
while
alf
was
unloading
and
had
gone
the
thirty
miles
right
across
country
with
him
after
them
full
chase
alf
was
too
to
explain
things
at
the
time
and
he
never
mentioned
it
when
he
loaded
our
first
wool
a
month
ago
montgomery
heard
the
truth
of
it
only
the
other
day
so
when
he
met
alf
he
stopped
him
and
mentioned
it
and
told
him
to
shove
his
bullocks
in
martin
paddock
for
that
night
as
grass
was
so
scarce
it
must
have
cut
martin
to
the
bone
to
see
a
kindly
thing
done
but
he
had
to
grin
and
bear
it
treasuring
up
wrath
against
the
day
of
wrath
as
shakespear
says
then
martin
may
be
here
any
minute
well
i
left
him
a
little
better
than
two
mile
away
trying
to
track
his
horse
and
he
ca
track
worth
a
dash
certainly
he
was
headed
toward
the
station
the
last
i
saw
of
him
but
if
he
got
a
spare
saddle
at
home
here
he
pretty
certain
to
come
for
a
fresh
horse
to
hunt
up
the
other
i
give
five
notes
if
i
had
it
to
see
these
fellows
yoked
up
and
off
for
if
martin
catches
them
there
be
sheol
to
pay
and
no
pitch
hot
and
by
george
there
not
half
a
second
to
lose
just
look
at
that
fence
ah
here
they
come
good
lads
well
take
care
of
yourself
tom
and
give
us
a
call
at
the
station
as
soon
as
you
can
i
keep
out
of
sight
till
these
chaps
are
started
then
i
have
a
bit
of
breakfast
with
daddy
montague
and
invent
a
good
watertight
lie
and
do
a
skulk
for
an
hour
or
two
and
then
dodge
on
to
the
station
as
slowly
as
possible
i
want
something
to
go
wrong
in
the
store
while
montgomery
has
charge
himself
it
learn
him
to
appreciate
me
better
i
have
to
ram
it
down
his
throat
that
the
fellows
had
their
bullocks
out
before
i
got
here
wait
moriarty
what
martin
horse
like
i
might
see
him
star
and
snip
white
hind
feet
bang
tail
one
of
the
best
mokes
on
the
station
belongs
to
martin
himself
i
hope
he
scratch
the
bridle
off
and
roll
on
the
saddle
till
it
not
worth
a
cuss
i
say
if
martin
should
find
his
way
here
before
the
fellows
get
clear
will
you
just
tell
him
i
fancied
i
saw
his
horse
going
for
the
connelly
paddock
and
i
shot
after
him
no
message
for
beaudesart
well
so
long
and
the
good
and
faithful
young
servant
cantered
away
toward
an
adjacent
swamp
i
was
picking
up
my
possum
rug
and
saddle
when
i
heard
dixon
voice
in
earnest
entreaty
looking
round
i
saw
him
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
hammock
say
collins
will
you
fetch
my
adj
bullocks
while
yer
hand
in
i
ca
move
this
mornin
yes
dixon
i
wo

o
one
o
the
yokes
here
it
put
a
adj
set
on
me
any
road
with
a
few
words
of
condolence
i
entered
the
paddock
carrying
my
saddle
and
bridle
as
i
came
in
sight
of
cleopatra
i
was
constrained
to
pause
and
reflect
the
horse
was
feeding
composedly
saddled
and
bridled
a
pair
of
hobbles
hanging
to
the
saddle
the
bridle
was
a
cheap
affair
but
the
saddle
was
as
good
as
they
make
them
in
wagga
and
quite
new
during
the
previous
afternoon
i
had
marked
something
incongruous
in
bum
ownership
of
such
a
piece
of
furniture
but
being
always
i
trust
superior
to
anything
like
surprise
i
saddled
and
mounted
bunyip
took
cleopatra
by
the
rein
and
joined
the
ishmaelites
who
on
their
horses
were
hurrying
contingents
of
cattle
from
different
directions
toward
the
gap
of
the
fence
whilst
the
fascination
of
overhanging
danger
bore
so
heavily
on
their
personal
and
professional
dignity
that
every
eye
kept
an
anxious
toward
the
in
a
few
minutes
more
we
were
all
outside
the
fence
and
the
drivers
immediately
began
yoking
i
hooked
cleopatra
rein
on
a
and
still
riding
bunyip
kept
thompson
and
cooper
bullocks
together
mosey
dog
was
performing
the
same
office
for
him
and
price
willoughby
had
returned
with
the
muster
and
bum
was
still
absent
did
you
count
my
bullocks
demanded
dixon
limping
slowly
and
painfully
toward
his
big
roan
horse
o
you
sweet
speciment
retorted
mosey
as
he
picked
up
his
second
yoke
why
the
compound
expletive
do
you
rouse
roun
how
the
same
expression

ah
would
you
indeed
on
you
go
dem
you
get
up
there
it
was
willoughby
voice
among
the
and
the
next
moment
beasts
leaped
the
wires
and
darted
capering
and
shying
past
the
wagons
quod
petis
hic
est
panted
their
pursuer
triumphantly
the
mouse
may
help
the
lion
remember
according
to
the
old
then
such
a
cataract
of
obscenity
and
invective
from
price
and
mosey
while
cooper
remarked
gravely
them
ai
our
bullocks
willerby
them
station
cattle
shoved
in
that
paddick
for
something
now
they
off
to
sheol
an
it
three
good
hours
work
with
a
horse
an
stockwhip
to
in
here
agen
an
that
kangaroo
dog
ai
makin
matters
much
better
lord
stan
by
us
now
for
we
git
adv
near
hung
if
we
caught
and
to
be
sure
there
was
pup
looping
himself
along
the
plain
in
hot
pursuit
it
was
no
use
attempting
to
call
him
off
for
nature
has
not
endowed
the
kangaroo
dog
with
sufficient
instinct
to
bring
him
in
touch
with
his
master
except
when
the
latter
offers
him
food
but
there
is
always
some
penalty
attached
to
the
possession
of
anything
really
valuable
so
though
i
was
interested
in
the
cattle
i
was
bound
to
follow
them
till
i
recovered
my
dog
thompson
unpretentious
stockwhip
was
in
my
hand
at
the
time
and
judging
it
unlikely
that
cleopatra
had
been
broken
in
to
the
use
of
that
disquieting
implement
i
was
just
turning
bunyip
round
when
willoughby
stepped
forward
permit
me
to
redeem
my
unfortunate
mistake
by
assisting
you
he
exclaimed
i
have
ridden
to
hounds
in
england
may
i
take
this
horse
thanks
pray
remember
that
i
shall
be
under
your
orders
collins
take
care
might
he
i
remarked
casually
as
the
whaler
gathered
cleopatra
reins
and
threw
himself
into
the
deep
seat
of
the
new
saddle
and
to
my
genuine
astonishment
he
did
but
he
took
no
mean
advantage
of
his
rider
he
allowed
him
time
to
find
the
off
stirrup
and
then
led
off
with
a
forward
spring
about
five
feet
high
willoughby
small
blame
to
him
was
jerked
clean
out
of
the
saddle
and
lit
fair
across
the
horse
loins
in
the
impulse
of
grasping
the
cantle
with
both
hands
the
small
afforded
a
good
rough
hold
and
the
next
buck
jammed
the
poor
fellow
well
under
the
seat
of
the
saddle
the
position
was
neither
pleasant
nor
dignified
though
certainly
more
secure
for
an
amateur
than
the
conventional
style
particularly
after
the
horse
tremendous
plunges
had
raised
the
back
of
the
saddle
a
foot
or
more
by
dint
of
fair
wedging
price
mosey
thompson
and
cooper
forgot
the
dangers
of
the
time
and
discontinued
their
work
drawing
near
the
spot
with
a
carefully
preserved
air
of
indifference
and
even
dixon
ignored
his
screwmatics
and
composed
his
demeanour
to
something
like
apathy
owing
to
the
leverage
of
the
saddle
the
girth
was
gripping
cleopatra
in
a
ticklish
place
and
the
bow
of
the
saddle
was
dipping
into
another
ticklish
place
whilst
willoughby
swinging
feet
provided
for
the
ticklish
places
on
the
horse
thighs
and
flanks
cleopatra
mistook
all
this
for
deliberate
provocation
and
responded
to
the
very
best
of
his
splendid
ability
early
in
the
entertainment
willoughby
hat
was
bucked
off
his
head
presently
the
wellington
boot
was
bucked
off
one
foot
and
the
blucher
off
the
other
the
following
in
due
course
then
the
portion
of
attire
known
to
one
section
of
society
as
and
to
another
as
the
was
bucked
out
of
that
necessary
garment
which
we
shrink
from
naming
the
ground
was
cut
up
as
if
rooted
by
pigs
yet
cleopatra
was
only
just
warming
to
his
work
and
the
whaler
was
still
clinging
to
the
saddle
like
a
native
bear
to
a
branch
god
help
thee
jack
i
remarked
listlessly
thou
hast
a
bitter
breakfast
o
he
tire
the
horse
out
yet
said
thompson
with
an
artificial
yawn
good
lad
willoughby
stick
to
him
a
bit
longer
got
no
holt
observed
dixon
gone
goose
any
time
he
do
want
no
pipeclay
anyhow
said
mosey
with
childish
levity
people
ought
to
steer
clear
o
playful
horses
all
eyes
were
turned
on
the
young
fellow
face
in
surprise
and
reprehension
and
he
uneasily
attempted
to
carry
off
his
inadvertent
solecism
with
a
sort
of
swagger
the
horse
ca
hold
out
much
longer
at
that
rate
repeated
thompson
stooping
to
lace
his
boots
ca
he
drawled
cooper
poking
out
the
stem
of
his
pipe
with
a
stalk
of
grass
he
can
hold
out
till
something
gives
way
that
what
he
in
the
habit
o
doin
i
thinkin
an
he
ai
to
break
his
rule
this
time
the
got
at
you
that
trip
collins
remarked
mosey
seeking
to
retrieve
his
dignity
by
turning
his
back
on
the
performance
he
seen
you
comin
say
ole
son
how
you
like
to
swap
back
i
kep
misdoubtin
that
hoss
all
the
adj
time
observed
nestor
wisely
i
felt
sort
o
jubious
i
did
wanter
say
nothink
there
goes
the
pore
fellow
at
last
i
knowed
the
horse
would
do
it
said
cooper
as
the
stern
captive
spum
his
weary
load
and
asked
the
image
back
that
heaven
bestowed
collar
the
horse
quick
suggested
dixon
nail
him
now
or
you
never
ketch
him
no
great
hurry
i
muttered
dismounting
however
i
think
i
better
have
it
out
with
him
while
he
warm
or
perhaps
one
of
you
fellows
would
like
a
try
while
i
do
his
yoking
just
for
a
change
cleopatra
now
nibbling
the
scanty
grass
glanced
from
time
to
time
with
grave
sympathy
at
his
late
rider
who
was
occupying
himself
with
his
toilet
ketch
the
horse
quick
reiterated
dixon
i
would
mind
if
i
had
my
mare
back
again
i
remarked
as
i
approached
cleopatra
head
by
jacob
staff
i
swear
i
have
no
mind
of
trying
conclusions
with
this
fellow
for
a
dull
sickening
the
adjectives
were
shorn
of
their
noun
for
cleopatra
accurately
gauging
his
distance
suddenly
sprung
round
and
lashed
out
with
both
hind
feet
you
could
have
struck
a
match
on
the
smoothest
part
of
my
earthly
tabernacle
as
i
dodged
him
by
about
half
an
inch
then
he
went
on
cropping
the
grass
as
before
while
i
looked
round
and
inquired
with
sickly
bravado
what
noble
lucumo
comes
next
to
taste
our
roman
cheer
but
the
bullock
drivers
silently
repudiated
the
grim
invitation
and
hurried
back
to
their
work
which
they
now
pursued
with
redoubled
vigour
and
anxiety
i
remounted
bunyip
and
caught
cleopatra
from
his
back
then
dismounting
i
arranged
the
new
saddle
with
ostentatious
offhandedness
though
in
a
prayerful
frame
of
mind
and
presently
climbed
on
as
if
nothing
was
the
matter
i
certainly
anticipated
westminster
abbey
rather
than
a
peerage
but
the
horse
with
a
nonchalance
greater
than
my
own
inasmuch
as
it
was
genuine
turned
quietly
round
as
i
pressed
the
rein
against
his
neck
and
sailed
away
across
the
plain
at
his
own
inimitable
canter
then
i
looked
back
to
see
the
bullock
drivers
disgustedly
resume
the
work
they
had
again
suspended
by
this
time
the
cattle
had
crossed
a
swamp
and
were
out
of
sight
but
before
i
had
gone
a
quarter
of
a
mile
i
saw
pup
coming
to
meet
me
limping
and
crestfallen
he
had
probably
been
kicked
by
one
of
the
absconders
and
as
he
could
see
no
sign
of
civilisation
except
our
camp
his
sagacity
had
drawn
him
back
well
pleased
therefore
i
returned
to
the
wagons
after
a
few
minutes
absence
the
cattle
are
out
of
sight
steve
said
i
as
i
rounded
up
the
scattering
bullocks
not
worth
while
to
go
after
them
now
let
them
go
by
all
means
replied
thompson
with
a
ghastly
simulation
of
cheerfulness
we
gladly
stand
the
loss
of
them
and
make
the
station
a
present
of
bum
mare
besides
if
we
once
get
out
of
sight
of
this
infernal
camp
stand
up
magpie
just
let
us
yoke
up
as
quickly
as
if
our
lives
depended
on
it
which
to
tell
the
truth
is
not
much
of
an
exag
hello
where
damper
stuck
in
a
gluepot
jist
in
front
o
the
adj
hut
replied
mosey
without
pausing
in
his
work
i
seen
him
there
back
snailey
or
i
knock
the
adj
horn
off
o
you
but
i
thought
it
was
one
o
them
station
cattle
till
you
minded
me
why
the
sheol
did
you
count
yer
lot
properly
a
deep
oath
broke
from
the
lips
of
the
man
who
never
swore
but
he
controlled
himself
by
a
strong
effort
how
much
of
him
above
ground
he
asked
adv
little
his
horns
or
else
i
knowed
him
wub
back
major
replied
mosey
reluctantly
as
he
chained
his
last
pair
then
i
grieve
to
say
thompson
let
himself
out
no
puerile
repetition
no
slovenly
slipshod
work
there
it
was
the
performance
of
a
born
orator
and
poet
and
one
who
like
timothy
had
known
the
scriptures
from
a
child
a
long
involved
litany
of
seething
malediction
delivered
moreover
with
a
measured
and
effortless
eloquence
and
a
grammatical
exactitude
which
left
ernulphus
a
bad
second
the
other
fellows
pursued
their
work
in
silence
till
at
length
cooper
glancing
toward
the
said
deprecatingly
it
man
do
swear
not
now
anyway
i
fetch
these
ten
across
an
they
adv
soon
snake
him
out
git
that
spare
rope
off
o
my
wagon
an
foller
me
quick
he
brought
his
yoked
bullocks
through
the
gap
and
drove
them
rapidly
to
the
spot
indicated
by
mosey
thompson
mounted
his
horse
and
cantered
after
with
the
heavy
coil
of
rope
across
the
front
of
his
saddle
i
accompanied
him
at
the
very
extremity
of
the
clump
and
not
fifty
yards
from
the
house
was
one
of
those
bottomless
quagmires
too
common
in
riverina
it
was
about
twenty
yards
across
and
in
the
very
centre
damper
head
and
the
line
of
his
back
appeared
above
the
surface
the
straight
furrow
behind
him
showing
that
he
had
been
bogged
at
the
edge
but
being
unable
to
turn
and
being
exceedingly
strong
and
sound
had
worked
himself
along
to
the
middle
where
he
was
slowly
settling
down
in
a
couple
of
minutes
one
end
of
the
sixty
feet
long
and
an
inch
and
in
diameter
was
looped
round
the
roots
of
the
bullock
horns
and
the
team
was
attached
to
the
fall
then
a
slow
steady
strain
drove
damper
nose
into
the
ground
and
gently
shifted
him
first
forward
then
upward
then
on
to
the
surface
where
he
slid
smoothly
to
the
solid
ground
we
released
him
there
and
he
staggered
to
his
feet
shook
himself
thoroughly
and
followed
the
team
to
the
camp
ravenously
snatching
mouthfuls
of
grass
as
he
went
along
price
and
mosey
had
just
got
under
way
willoughby
was
trying
to
yoke
dixon
leaders
while
dixon
owing
to
his
screwmatics
could
do
nothing
but
sit
on
his
horse
cursing
with
wearisome
tautology
and
casting
glances
of
frantic
apprehension
toward
the
his
anxiety
was
not
unreasonable
for
there
had
just
come
into
sight
an
upright
speck
too
small
to
be
a
horseman
and
it
was
easy
to
guess
who
was
the
likeliest
person
to
be
coming
on
foot
from
that
direction
there
is
a
limit
to
the
dignified
sufficiency
even
of
a
bullock
driver

unhappy
conjecture

gingerly
approached
the
excited

essaying

the

he
was

and

instantly
recovering

dixon
bullocks
were
exceptionally
docile
for
that
uncultivated
animal
was
one
of
the
most
humane
and
skilful
drivers
in
riverina
therefore
about
minutes
sufficed
to
place
his
team
in
readiness
for
a
start
you
might
as
well
come
along
o
me
for
a

said
he
to
willoughby
we
git
on

i
a

i

it

an
i
would

nor
you

wo
be

after

rejoined
willoughby
bowing
gaily
to
me
then
taking
up
the
whip
dixon
was
a
virtuoso
in
whips
and
always
carried
one
with
six
feet
of
handle
and
twelve
feet
of
lash
he
aimed
at
the
team
collectively
a
clip
which
in
the
most
literal
sense
recoiled
on
himself
and
so
the
officer
son
and
the
sojer
son
took
their
way
together
to
become
as
i
afterward
learned
the
most
attached
and
mutually
considerate
friends
on
the
track
such
is
life
thompson
and
cooper
now
ready
for
the
road
were
repairing
the
fence
as
well
as
they
could
this
being
done
and
the
relics
of
the
fire
kicked
about
they
put
their
teams
in
motion
leaving
little
trace
of
the
camp
except
bum
mare
standing
asleep
outside
the
fence
the
ominous
speck
on
the
plain
had
approached
much
nearer
but
had
taken
definite
form
as
an
emu
and
now
the
negative
blessing
of
escape
seemed
like
a
positive
benefaction
if
says
carlyle
thou
wert
condemned
to
be
hanged
which
is
probably
less
than
thou
deservest
thou
wouldest
esteem
it
happiness
to
be
shot
serene
gratitude
therefore
shone
in
the
frank
faces
of
the
outlaws
tempered
however
in
thompson
case
by
salutary
remorse
for
his
companion
had
reproachfully
asked
him
what
the
adj
sheol
good
his
swearing
had
done
we
could
see
price
teams
stopped
half
a
mile
away
one
of
the
loads
appearing
low
and
canted
over
to
the
off
side
bogged
evidently
dixon
wagon
was
close
in
front
of
us
willoughby
was
zealously
flogging
himself
and
occasionally
we
could
hear
dixon
voice
in
encouragement
and
counsel
the
place
where
price
wagon
was
stuck
was
not
a
creek
but
merely
a
narrow
belt
of
treacherous
ground
mosey
had
gone
down
six
inches
but
price
had
happened
on
a
bad
place
and
his
wagon
had
found
the
bottom
all
mosey
team
except
the
polers
had
been
hooked
on
but
with
no
result
beyond
the
breaking
of

thompson
said
mosey
as
my
companions
stopped
their
teams
and
went
on

thompson
did
as
desired
and
the
first
pull
brought
the
wagon
on
to
solid
ground
meanwhile
dixon
and
willoughby
had
taken
their
team
through
and
were
hurrying
along
cooper
growling
maledictions
on
everything
connected
with
port
phillip
roads
in
particular
had
selected
his
route
and
started
his
team
thompson
hooked
on
to
his
own
wagon
and
crossed
safely
but
with
very
little
to
spare
he
remarked
to
me
another
bale
would
have
anchored
her
ah
cooper
in
it
with
all
his
cleverness
cooper
was
in
it
the
hawkesbury
with
tons
of
load
was
down
to
the
and
the
cornstalk
was
endeavouring
by
means
of
extracts
from
the
sermons
of
knox
soundest
followers
to
do
something
like
justice
to
the
contingency
thompson
sighed
glanced
toward
the
and
hooked
his
team
in
front
of
cooper
mosey
who
had
been
mending
his
broken
chain
with
wire
now
came
over
with
price
we
give
you
a
lend
of
our

said
he
with
cheap
complaisance
take

picked
bullocks
planted

and

and
a
hundred
and
seventy
feet
of
bar

stretched
tense
and
rigid
from
the
leaders
yoke
to
the
the
wagon
crept
forward
a
low
grumble
more
a
growl
than
a
bellow
passed
from
beast
to
beast
along
the
team
sure
indication
that
the
wagon
would
stop
again
if
it
could
be
taken
through
the
off
front
wheel
rose
slowly
on
harder
ground
the
off
hind
wheel
rose
in
its
turn
both
near
wheels
ploughed
deeper
beneath
the
weight
of
bales
she
over
thundered
cooper
keep
her
goin
it
her
chance
then
the
heavy
pine
whipsticks
bent
like
bulrushes
in
the
skilful
hands
while
a
spray
of
dissevered
hair
and
sometimes
a
line
of
springing
blood
followed
each
detonation
the
libretto
being
in
keeping
a
few
yards
forward
still
while
both
off
wheels
rose
to
the
surface
and
both
near
wheels
sank
till
the
naves
burrowed
in
the
ground
then
the
wagon
swung
heavily
over
on
its
near
side
john
said
cooper
with
fine
immobility
job
by
rights
will
you
give
us
a
hand
collins
for
price
and
mosey
were
silently
returning
to
their
teams
certainly
i
will
well
it
a
half
day
contract
i
git
some
breakfast
ready
while
you
fellows
unloosens
the
ropes
thompson
and
i
released
the
bullocks
from
the
pole
unfastened
the
ropes
and
brought
the
wagon
down
to
its
wheels
again
then
cooper
summoned
us
to
breakfast
you
jist
take
sort
o
collins
he
remarked
i
should
baked
some
soda
bread
an
boiled
some
meat
last
night
for
bein
too
busy
doin
nothing
laziness
is
catchin
that
why
i
hate
a

o

campin
together
it
nothing
but

looked

where

got

o

idle
women
ca
cooper
was
an
observer
it
was
pleasant
to
hear
him
philosophise
the
work
of
reloading
was
made
severe
and
tedious
by
the
lack
of
any
better
skids
than
the
poles
of
the
two
wagons
was
indeed
made
impossible
under
the
circumstances
but
for
cooper
enormous
and
wellsaved
strength
our
toil
was
enlivened
however
by
an
argument
as
to
the
esoteric
cause
of
the
capsize
cooper
maintained
that
nothing
better
could
have
been
hoped
for
after
leaving
kenilworth
shed
on
a
friday
thompson
untrammelled
by
such
superstition
contended
that
the
misadventure
was
solely
due
to
travelling
on
sunday
whilst
i
held
it
to
be
merely
a
proof
that
cooper
in
spite
of
his
sins
was
deserted
yet
each
of
us
supported
his
argument
by
a
wealth
of
illustrative
cases
and
thus
fortified
his
own
stubborn
opinion
to
his
own
perfect
satisfaction
then
descending
to
more
tangible
things
we
discussed
cleopatra
here
we
were
unanimous
in
deciding
that
the
horse
had
as
yet
disclosed
only
two
faults
and
these
not
the
faults
of
the
irishman
horse
in
the
weary
yarn
one
of
them
we
concluded
was
to
buck
like
a
demon
on
being
first
mounted
and
the
other
was
to
grope
backward
for
the
person
who
went
to
catch
him
after
delivery
of
loading
in
the
meantime
four
horsemen
with
three
went
by
then
two
horse
teams
loaded
outward
then
stewart
of
kooltopa
paused
to
give
a
few
words
of
sympathy
as
he
drove
past
then
far
ahead
we
saw
two
wool
teams
evidently
from
boolka
converging
slowly
toward
the
main
track
then
more
wool
came
in
sight
from
the
five
or
six
miles
behind
by
this
time
it
was
after
and
cooper
having
tied
the
last
levers
looked
round
before
descending
from
the
load
somebody
on
a
grey
horse
comin
along
the
track
from
the
an
another
fellow
on
a
brown
horse
comin
across
the
plain
he
remarked
wonder
if
one
o
them
he
rose
a
horse
at
the
station
i
was
thinking
about
replied
thompson
i
forgot
martin
duffing
soon
comes
under
the
statute
of
limitations
i
suggested
yes
come
and
have
a
drink
of
tea
and
a
bit
of
cooper
pastry
his
cookery
does
fatten
but
it
fills
up
o
you
adj
liar
gently
protested
the
cornstalk
as
he
seated
himself
on
the
ground
beside
the
is
this
martin
for
the
man
on
the
grey
horse
was
approaching
at
a
canter
no
i
replied
he
a
stranger
to
me
but
that
martin
on
the
brown
horse
said
thompson
with
rising
vexation
keep
him
on
a
string
tom
if
you
can
do
let
him
drive
us
into
a
lie
about
last
night
for
after
all
i
be
hanged
if
i
man
enough
to
tell
him
the
truth
nor
wo
be
for
the
next
fortnight
or
three
weeks
by
this
time
the
man
on
the
grey
horse
was
passing
us
in
response
to
thompson
invitation
he
stopped
and
dismounted
jist
help
yourself
an
your
friends
like
you
the
better
as
the
sayin
is
said
cooper
handing
him
a
pannikin
thanks
i
do
so
i
did
have
any
breakfast
this
morning
replied
the
stranger
picking
up
a
which
liberal
shepherds
give
a
grosser
name
and
eating
it
with
relish
while
the
interior
lamina
of
dough
spued
out
from
between
the
charred
crusts
under
the
pressure
of
his
strong
teeth
been
having
a
little
mishap
yes
nothing
broke
though
how
long
since
my
lads
passed
i
see
their
tracks
on
the
road
about
three
hours
replied
thompson
did
you
meet
an
old
man
and
a
young
fellow
with
horse
behind
one
of
the
wagons
good
day
martin
have
a
drink
of
tea
yes
i
met
them
replied
the
stranger
old
price
teams
i
think
good
day
martin
six
or
seven
miles
from
here
dixon
travelling
behind
with
another
fellow
driving
his
team
brother
apparently
where
did
you
fellows
have
your
bullocks
last
night
demanded
martin
his
eye
resting
on
the
stucco
which
covered
of
damper
colossal
personality
and
did
you
see
a
dark
chestnut
horse
bang
tail
star
and
snip
white
hind
feet
saddle
and
bridle
on
i
asked
i
ran
across
moriarty
this
morning
i
continued
turning
politely
to
martin
and
he
told
me
he
was
after
a
horse
of
that
description
but
he
was
in
a
hurry
dark
chestnut
horse
bang
tail
star
and
snip
white
hind
feet
jr
near
shoulder
like
in
circle
off
thigh
said
the
stranger
reflectively
yes
i
saw
the
horse
this
morning
but
the
owner
has
got
him
again
young
fellow
tweed
pants
strapped
with
moleskin
i
met
him
at
the
nalrooka
boundary
shortly
after
sunrise
thirty
miles
from
here
i
should
say
i
was
speaking
to
him
he
told
me
the
horse
had
slung
him
and
got
away
from
him
last
night
and
he
had
found
him
by
good
luck
before
daylight
this
morning
he
came
down
on
his
hand
poor
beggar
it
swelled
like
a
but
he
taking
it
out
of
the
horse
now
in
the
riverina
of
that
period
it
was
considered
much
more
disgraceful
to
be
had
by
a
scoundrel
than
to
commit
a
felony
yourself
therefore
martin
partly
grasping
the
situation
assumed
an
oblivious
and
even
drowsy
air
did
the
young
fellow
say
where
he
was
going
i
asked
pitying
martin
dilemma
and
admiring
his
greatness
of
soul
for
i
had
more
than
once
been
there
myself
no
he
only
wanted
to
borrow
a
pipe
of
tobacco
but
after
we
parted
i
saw
him
strike
out
across
the
plain
to
the
right
martin
yawned
turned
his
horse
and
rode
slowly
toward
the
selection
very
slowly
so
that
the
stranger
might
overtake
him
soon
come
weal
come
woe
he
would
trail
his
honour
in
the
dust
before
three
cynical
onlookers
well
i
push
on
said
the
stranger
setting
down
his
pannikin
i
want
to
pull
my
chaps
and
i
thinking
about
my
horse
i
say
glancing
after
martin
and
lowering
his
voice
you
fellows
have
a
devil
of
a
bad
show
for
you
right
replied
thompson
tell
you
what
you
do
camp
at
the
belars
and
they
think
you
on
for
the
then
between
the
two
lights
just
scoot
for
the
dead
horse
swamp
never
any
grass
there
said
thompson
that
the
beauty
of
it
replied
the
stranger
they
been
putting
down
a
tank
in
the
middle
of
the
swamp
this
winter
and
the
contractor
had
about
a
dozen
young
fellows
every
one
of
them
with
a
horse
and
a
dog
kicking
up
sheol
delight
there
has
been
a
smell
of
a
sheep
within
of
the
swamp
for
the
last
three
months
and
the
paddock
was
mustered
for
shearing
just
before
the
contractor
left
it
into
your
hand
for
well
i
must
i
beg
your
pardon
said
thompson
hesitatingly
are
you
coming
direct
from
hay
well
i
left
on
saturday
morning
the
mailman
was
telling
me
continued
thompson
wistfully
that
permewan
and
wright
had
three
ton
of
dynamite
for
broken
hill
do
you
know
is
it
gone
yet
not
when
i
left
replied
the
encyclopedia
australiensis
they
offering
eighty
and
i
no
doubt
they
spring
to
a
hundred
tack
and
there
not
a
blade
of
grass
once
you
pass
the
merowie
good
day
boys
and
nodding
to
us
collectively
he
departed
steve
said
i
are
you
a
man
to
go
fooling
with
high
explosives
considering
the
thing
that
on
you
well
replied
thompson
doggedly
it
come
to
this
with
me
that
i
must
make
a
spoon
or
spoil
a
horn
and
if
that
infernal
thing
would
only
keep
off
till
i
got
the
stuff
delivered
i
be
right
my
bullocks
are
fit
for
any
track
in
australia
let
git
down
to
hay
fust
interposed
cooper
then
you
can
do
as
you
like
but
i
be
wantin
a
that
take
me
safe
out
o
port
phillip
say
collins
i
buy
that
new
saddle
off
o
you
mine
all
in
splinters
for
my
horse
he
a
beggar
to
roll
i
hardly
feel
justified
in
selling
it
i
replied
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
sell
you
my
own
saddle
cheap
say
three
notes
and
give
you
bum
bridle
in
cooper
agreed
to
the
proposal
then
as
pup
had
been
eating
about
ten
pounds
of
salt
mutton
stolen
from
the
bullock
drivers
stores
i
enticed
him
to
take
a
good
drink
of
water
knowing
he
would
need
it
before
the
day
was
over
it
was
absolutely
imperative
that
i
should
go
thirty
miles
and
then
if
possible
camp
alone
so
i
shook
hands
with
the
outlaws
and
started
leading
bunyip
till
he
should
become
accustomed
to
his
new
companion
if
the
unmannerly
reader
wishes
to
know
why
i
was
bound
to
a
stage
of
exactly
thirty
miles
i
have
no
objection
to
state
that
knowing
the
geography
of
riverina
as
well
as
if
i
had
laid
out
the
whole
territory
myself
i
was
aware
of
a
sandhill
composed
of
material
unstable
as
water
an
unfavourable
place
for
a
bucking
horse
and
a
favourable
place
for
a
man
to
dismount
head
foremost
if
the
worst
came
and
that
was
my
destination
chapter
ii
when
i
undertook
the
pleasant
task
of
writing
out
these
reminiscences
i
engaged
you
will
remember
to
amplify
the
record
of
one
week
judging
that
a
rigidly
faithful
analysis
of
that
sample
would
disclose
the
approximate
percentage
of
happiness
virtue
in
life
but
whilst
writing
the
annotations
on
which
by
the
way
gratuitously
overlap
on
the
following
day
i
saw
an
alpine
difficulty
looming
ahead
at
the
blowhard
on
the
night
of
the
i
camped
with
a
party
of
six
sons
of
belial
bound
for
deniliquin
with
boolka
wethers
off
the
shears
now
anyone
who
has
listened
for
four
hours
to
the
conversation
of
a
group
of
sheep
drovers
named
respectively
splodger
rabbit
parson
bottler
dingo
and
ike
will
agree
with
me
as
to
the
impossibility
of
getting
the
dialogue
of
such
dramatis
personae
into
anything
like
printable
form
the
bullock
drivers
were
bad
enough
but
these
fellows
are
out
of
the
question
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
a
wider
scope
of
observation
might
give
in
perhaps
fewer
pages
a
fairer
estimate
of
that
ageless
enigma
the
true
solution
of
which
forms
our
and
only
responsibility
i
therefore
concluded
to
skip
one
calendar
month
dipping
again
into
my
old
diary
at
in
the
same
year
namely
after
this
i
shall
pick
out
of
each
consecutive
month
the
day
for
amplification
and
comment
keeping
not
too
long
in
one
tune
but
a
snip
and
away
this
will
prospect
the
gutter
of
life
gutter
is
good
at
different
points
in
other
words
it
will
give
us
a
range
of
seven
months
instead
of
seven
days
the
thread
of
narrative
being
thus
purposely
broken
no
one
of
these
short
and
simple
analyses
can
have
any
connection
with
another
a
point
on
which
i
congratulate
the
judicious
reader
and
the
no
less
judicious
writer
for
the
former
is
thereby
tacitly
warned
against
any
expectation
of
plot
or
denouement
and
so
secured
against
disappointment
whilst
the
latter
is
relieved
from
the
to
him
impossible
task
of
investing
prosaic
people
with
romance
and
a
generally
economy
with
poetical
justice
go
to
then
goolumbulla
to
rory
this
record
transports
you
saving
reverence
of
our
stain
something
more
than
a
hundred
miles
northward
from
the
scene
sketched
in
thus
unveiling
a
territory
blank
on
the
map
and
similarly
qualified
in
the
ordinary
conversation
of
its
inhabitants
the
willandra
billabong
which
in
moderately
wet
seasons
relieves
the
middle
lachlan
of
some
superfluous
water
and
in
reluctantly
debouches
into
the
lower
darling
divides
the
country
between
those
rivers
into
two
unequal
parts
roughly
speaking
the
plains
which
are
chiefly
light
red
lie
to
the
south
of
this
almost
imperceptible
depression
whilst
on
the
north
sometimes
close
by
sometimes
out
of
sight
and
sometimes
thirty
miles
away
the
irregular
scrub
frontier
denotes
an
abrupt
change
of
soil
though
the
uniform
level
is
maintained
here
you
enter
upon
a
region
presenting
to
the
rarely
clouded
sky
an
unbroken
with
isothermal
zones
rigidly
marked
by
their
indigenous
growths
a
tract
of
country
until
yesterday
bare
of
surface
water
for
lack
of
occupation
and
lacking
occupation
for
dearth
of
surface
water
which
goes
to
show
that
regularity
of
rainfall
is
not
ensured
by
copious
growth
of
timber
however
a
hundred
miles
back
in
that
leafy
solitude
just
where
the
line
of
water
conservation
creeping
northward
from
the
lachlan
here
and
there
touched
the
line
creeping
southward
from
the
darling
i
was
standing
in
the
veranda
of
the
barracks
on
goolumbulla
station
when
the
narangies
pagan
henchman
announced
brekfit
leddy
all
li
during
the
meal
jack
ward
the
senior
narangy
made
some
remark
implying
that
certain
cattle
on
a
certain
occasion
had
scented
water
from
a
fabulous
distance
whereupon
andrews
the
storekeeper
interrogated
deponent
with
some
severity
driving
him
down
down
to
three
hundred
yards
range
where
he
made
a
final
stand
but
the
two
junior
narangies
supported
ward
in
the
endowment
of
cattle
with
the
faculty
in
question
and
as
a
matter
of
course
each
young
fellow
supplemented
his
limited
experience
by
a
number
of
instances
all
alike
distinguished
by
that
want
of
proper
hang
which
makes
the
judicious
grieve
a
practical
knowledge
of
the
subject
founded
on
irrefragable
proofs
led
me
to
side
with
andrews
and
it
was
thus
that
i
came
to
quote
a
case
in
point
with
all
the
advantage
of
local
reference
it
will
be
necessary
to
lay
the
facts
before
you
in
two
years
and
eight
months
before
the
date
of
this
record
i
had
drawn
up
to
goolumbulla
homestead
with
six
tons
of
wire
the
manager
spanker
in
his
fine
way
asked
me
to
just
dump
it
down
carelessly
in
five
or
six
places
over
the
run
as
the
contractor
would
be
using
it
at
once
he
would
pay
me
for
the
extra
mileage
and
dan
would
show
me
where
to
sling
it
off
i
objected
to
the
mileage
agreement
inasmuch
as
carting
over
raw
ground
was
a
very
different
thing
from
travelling
on
a
track
i
wanted
a
day
for
the
extra
time
a
fair
current
rate
and
easily
counted
spanker
in
reply
had
no
objection
to
paying
by
the
day
but
as
my
account
came
to
and
as
it
had
taken
me
twelve
weeks
to
do
the
two
hundred
and
thirty
miles
from
hay
and
as
the
contractor
had
been
cursing
me
steadily
for
the
last
four
weeks
well
if
i
asked
him
anything
about
it
he
thought
that
ten
shillings
came
nearer
the
mark
and
was
almost
as
easily
counted
finally
with
that
pliancy
of
temper
which
keeps
me
down
in
the
world
i
assented
to
these
terms
whereupon
spanker
with
characteristic
perversity
called
it
fifteen
next
day
following
andrews
directions
i
took
the
faint
track
of
the
ration
cart
for
seven
or
eight
miles
and
found
a
tank
without
any
trouble
remember
that
this
is
a
recital
of
what
happened
long
before
the
date
of
our
record
early
next
morning
dan
joined
me
and
we
crawled
along
for
another
five
or
six
miles
on
a
still
fainter
track
marked
only
by
a
few
trips
of
the
contractor
wagonette
in
the
afternoon
we
struck
a
line
of
bored
posts
and
dumped
twenty
coils
in
due
time
i
unyoked
and
dan
led
me
to
a
new
tank
of
horribly
alkaline
water
thence
after
arranging
to
meet
me
in
the
morning
he
cut
across
to
his
own
boundary
hut
six
or
eight
miles
away
next
day
still
following
the
line
of
posts
we
dropped
the
rest
of
the
wire
and
before
dan
left
me
i
made
him
repeat
again
and
again
his
directions
for
finding
a
gilgie
which
he
knew
to
be
full
of
water
and
which
i
ought
to
strike
about
sunset
next
day
i
would
reach
the
station
in
good
time
thus
completing
a
loop
journey
of
miles
in
four
days
dan
had
impressed
me
as
a
person
likely
to
be
of
considerably
more
account
in
the
estimation
of
his
maker
than
of
his
and
having
previously
studied
men
of
the
same
description
i
now
accepted
this
involuntary
sentiment
as
the
only
way
of
accounting
for
something
not
unfamiliar
in
his
voice
and
bearing
a
man
of
average
stature
with
a
vast
black
beard
and
guileless
blue
eyes
set
off
by
a
powerful
armagh
accent
evidently
unobservant
uncritical
and
utterly
destitute
of
devil
in
any
form
it
seemed
that
the
spirit
of
the
bog
had
followed
him
into
the
bush
preserving
his
noxious
innocence
and
ineptitude
in
their
pristine
integrity
naturally
he
had
taken
a
slight
local
colour
but
this
seemed
to
express
the
limit
of
his
susceptibility
to
altered
conditions
yet
he
twice
startled
me
by
the
breadth
and
exactness
of
his
information
once
when
america
was
mentioned
and
he
glanced
at
the
character
and
policy
of
each
president
from
washington
to
van
buren
and
again
when
he
spoke
of
the
massacre
of
cawnpore
almost
as
if
he
had
been
there
at
the
time
also
an
unconscious
familiarity
with
the
bible
and
shakespear
was
noticeable
in
his
conversation
though
he
was
evidently
a
catholic
of
the
catholics
when
i
complimented
him
on
his
erudition
he
remarked
with
amusing
incompatibility
of
dialect
and
manner
it
thrue
fur
ye
me
father
hed
consitherable
mains
so
he
hed
an
a
ivver
done
a
han
turn
furbye
divarsion
to
a
come
out
here
however
you
will
now
understand
why
i
made
him
repeat
his
topographical
notes
half
a
dozen
times
before
i
let
him
go
just
at
sunset
i
struck
the
patch
of
sixty
or
eighty
acres
where
the
gilgie
ought
to
be
i
unyoked
with
despatch
then
left
the
bullocks
and
rode
round
looking
for
a
clump
of
mallee
which
would
indicate
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
water
no
use
i
could
find
no
mallee
anywhere
night
came
on
richest
starlight
though
of
course
dark
in
the
scrub
and
still
i
objurgated
round
and
purposely
scattered
the
bullocks
to
search
for
themselves
and
anathematised
in
all
directions
and
consigned
the
whole
vicinity
to
the
evil
one
for
lack
of
that
clump
of
mallee
hour
after
hour
passed
the
bullocks
from
time
to
time
trying
to
clear
off
for
the
distant
lachlan
and
i
spending
half
my
time
in
using
them
as
divining
rods
and
the
other
half
in
execrating
back
and
forward
in
search
of
that
mallee
it
was
about
midnight
when
i
gave
it
best
i
must
have
struck
the
wrong
spot
now
would
it
be
advisable
to
make
a
to
the
station
at
once
with
the
bullocks
loose
or
to
wait
for
morning
and
take
the
wagon
with
me
the
distance
was
eight
or
ten
miles
i
was
standing
near
the
edge
of
the
open
scrub
with
the
reins
over
my
arm
the
mare
was
famished
and
exhausted
the
bells
were
almost
silent
for
the
bullocks
stood
still
in
the
agony
of
thirst
the
weather
was
hot
and
they
had
barely
sipped
the
alkaline
water
at
last
camp
i
was
absently
observing
one
white
bullock
close
by
when
with
a
low
bellow
he
suddenly
darted
forward
eight
or
ten
yards
and
began
drinking
at
the
gilgie
that
bellow
was
answered
from
all
sides
and
in
two
minutes
his
nineteen
mates
were
sharing
the
discovery
meanwhile
i
had
let
fancy
go
amongst
them
after
putting
on
her
bell
and
taking
off
the
saddle
and
bridle
i
had
done
with
her
for
the
night
and
i
knew
that
the
water
was
good
for
all
the
beasts
stood
on
the
brink
and
drank
without
wetting
their
feet
but
how
had
the
first
bullock
found
the
water
after
he
and
his
mates
had
passed
it
a
dozen
times
and
within
a
few
yards
this
was
worth
investigating
at
once
so
before
thinking
about
supper
i
went
to
the
exact
spot
where
the
beast
had
been
standing
and
there
saw
the
stars
reflected
in
the
water
of
course
if
it
had
been
anything
like
a
permanent
supply
the
sound
of
frogs
or
yabbies
would
have
guided
the
beasts
to
it
at
once
but
even
wild
cattle
can
no
more
scent
water
than
we
can
though
they
make
better
use
of
such
faculties
as
they
possess
i
have
tested
the
supposition
deliberately
and
exhaustively
time
after
time
and
this
instance
is
cited
not
controversially
but
because
it
has
to
do
with
the
present
memoir
however
next
morning
after
verifying
the
tracks
of
the
thirsty
bullocks
so
near
the
gilgie
that
it
seemed
a
wonder
they
had
walked
into
it
i
looked
for
the
clump
of
mallee
i
do
believe
there
was
a
stick
of
it
within
miles
but
there
was
a
clump
of
yarran
where
it
should
have
been
a
stately
beefwood
sixty
feet
high
with
swarthy
column
furrowed
a
deep
and
heavy
tufts
of
foliage
like
bundles
of
long
leeks
in
colour
and
configuration
the
first
beefwood
i
had
seen
since
leaving
the
homestead
stood
close
to
the
water
making
a
fine
landmark
but
dan
sense
of
proportion
had
selected
the
adjacent
bit
of
yarran
and
as
i
told
the
he
had
never
concerned
himself
to
know
the
difference
between
yarran
and
mallee
curious
combination
of
a
fool
and
a
man
remarked
ward
is
he
either
of
the
two
asked
broome
my
belief
he
shams
both
easy
matter
to
sham
foolishness
obsened
williamson
not
so
easy
to
sham
information
any
relation
to
the
late
liberator
i
asked
dan
only
his
nickname
replied
andrews
his
proper
name
is
rory
rory
i
repeated
i
thought
i
had
met
him
before
but
could
place
him
and
so
rory
has
found
his
way
here
well
he
was
brought
here
replied
andrews
twelve
or
fourteen
years
ago
he
turned
up
at
moogoojinna
down
deniliquin
way
and
froze
to
the
station
then
when
arbuthnot
settled
this
place
five
years
ago
now
spanker
brought
rory
with
him
and
he
been
here
ever
since
got
married
at
moogoojinna
a
year
or
two
before
leaving
to
a
protestant
from
the
same
part
of
the
globe
as
himself
but
she
stayed
at
moogoojinna
for
her
confinement
and
only
came
up
four
years
ago
after
dan
was
settled
in
the
utopia

good
woman
in
her
way

spends
her
time
in
a
sort
of
steady
fury
for
she
came
to
moogoojinna
with
the
idea
of
collaring
something
worth
while
so
spanker
says
and
he
was
there
at
the
time
seems
she
did
want
dan
and
dan
did
want
her
but
somehow
they
were
married
before
they
came
to
an
understanding
he
very
good
to
her
in
his
own
inoffensive
way
and
she
leads
him
a
dog
life
one
kid
likely
you
knew
him
on
moogoojinna
according
to
his
own
account
he
came
straight
through
only
stopping
once
when
he
chummied
for
a
few
weeks
with
a
squatter
that
took
a
fancy
to
him
and
treated
him
like
a
brother
grain
of
salt
just
there
not
necessarily
i
replied
i
can
verify
his
statement
to
the
letter
for
i
was
that
and
i
straightway
unfolded
to
the
boys
an
earlier
page
of
dan
history
it
was
about
thirteen
years
before
at
that
time
i
was
really
suffering
the
embarrassment
of
riches
though
the
latter
consisted
only
of
those
chastening
experiences
which
daily
confront
adventurers
of
immature
judgment
and
scanty
resources
on
new
selections
the
local
storekeeper
however
was
keeping
me
supplied
with
the
luxuries
of
life
such
as
flour
spuds
tea
sugar
tobacco
whilst
turkeys
and
ducks
were
to
be
had
for
the
shooting
and
kangaroos
for
the
chasing
the
storekeeper
had
also
taken
charge
of
my
land
license
for
safety
and
occasionally
presented
documents
for
my
signature
making
me
feel
like
some
conscious
criminal
happily
let
off
for
the
present
with
a
caution
one
summer
evening
whilst
dragging
myself
home
from
work
i
encountered
a
young
fellow
who
i
flattered
myself
resembled
me
only
in
age
soft
as
a
cabbage
in
every
way
he
was
footsore
and
weary
as
well
as
homesick
and
despondent
to
the
verge
of
tears
in
one
hand
he
carried
a
carpet
bag
and
in
the
other
a
large
bundle
tied
up
in
a
coloured
handkerchief
in
his
conversation
he
employed
the
armagh
accent
with
such
slavish
fidelity
as
to
make
it
evident
that
he
regarded
any
other
form
of
speech
as
showing
culpable
ignorance
or
offensive
affectation
his
name
was
rory
of
course
i
offered
him
the
rugged
hospitalities
of
my
hut
in
the
morning
perceiving
that
his
feet
showed
startling
traces
of
the
walk
from
melbourne
i
constrained
him
to
rest
for
a
few
days
but
the
poor
fellow
had
a
painfully
outspoken
scruple
against
eating
the
damper
of
idleness
so
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
get
his
boots
on
without
supplication
for
divine
support
he
started
to
help
me
with
my
work
soon
our
acquaintance
ripened
to
intimacy
and
i
learned
something
of
his
history
like
the
majority
of
us
he
was
the
scion
of
an
ancient
family
he
was
the
youngest
of
eleven
all
surviving
at
latest
advices
praise
god
seven
of
these
had
swarmed
to
america
and
were
doing
well
glory
be
two
remained
in
their
native
hive
with
full
and
plenty
amen
whilst
he
and
his
brother
larry
had
staked
their
future
on
the
prosperity
of
australia
god
help
us
his
father
must
have
been
a
man
of
wealth
and
position
as
he
apparently
spent
his
whole
time
in
following
the
hounds
shooting
pheasants
and
catching
salmon
with
the
other
gentlemen
but
just
before
rory
left
home
his
father
and
mother
had
withdrawn
from
society
and
here
the
narrator
sudden
reticence
warned
me
not
to
inquire
into
the
details
of
the
old
couple
retirement
larry
it
appeared
had
been
doing
victoria
and
riverina
for
five
or
six
years
with
magnificent
though
unspecific
results
anyway
he
had
franked
rory
to
port
melbourne
pier
by
passage
warrant
but
seemed
to
have
made
no
provision
for
further
intercourse
and
rory
having
walked
the
streets
of
melbourne
for
two
whole
days
without
finding
any
trace
of
larry
had
concluded
that
he
must
be
in
riverina
and
that
it
would
be
a
brave
notion
to
slip
over
and
take
the
defaulter
by
surprise
hence
his
present
pilgrimage
poor
rory
in
spite
of
his
willingness
was
naturally
awkward
with
the
splitters
tools
nor
did
he
know
how
to
harness
a
horse
all
this
he
explained
to
me
was
a
penalty
adherent
to
people
who
by
reason
of
their
position
are
emancipated
from
manual
labour
but
when
a
heavy
soaking
pour
of
summer
rain
brought
the
ground
into
fencing
condition
i
noticed
that
he
could
handle
the
spade
with
a
strength
and
dexterity
rarely
equalled
within
my
observation
you
a
catholic
are
you
rory
i
speculated
one
evening
struck
by
the
simple
piety
of
some
asinine
remark
he
had
made
a
startled
look
of
remonstrance
and
deprecation
was
his
only
reply
however
as
it
has
always
been
my
rule
to
seek
information
at
first
hand
i
tried
in
a
friendly
and
confidential
way
to
draw
him
out
respecting
certain
of
his
church
usages
and
tenets
which
i
knew
to
be
garbled
and
falsified
by
protestant
bigotry
but
it
was
evident
that
throughout
every
fibre
of
his
moral
nature
there
ran
a
conviction
that
the
mere
mention
of
purgatory
or
transubstantiation
would
be
fatal
to
our
friendship
and
he
at
all
events
would
be
no
party
to
the
unmasking
of
that
great
gulf
which
hereditarily
divided
us
it
may
be
worth
while
before
we
go
any
farther
to
inquire
into
the
nature
and
origin
of
this
gulf
not
merely
for
the
sake
of
information
but
because
it
is
a
question
which
affects
the
moral
health
of
our
community
when
australia
was
first
colonised
any
sensible
man
might
have
foreboded
sorrel
cockspur
scotch
thistle
as
unwelcome
but
unavoidable
adjuncts
of
settlement
a
sage
might
have
predicted
that
some
colonist
in
a
fit
of
criminal
folly
would
scourge
the
country
with
a
legacy
of
foxes
rabbits
sparrows
but
a
second
and
jeremiah
could
never
have
prophesied
the
deliberate
introduction
of
hydrophobia
for
dogs
glanders
for
horses
or
orangeism
for
men
yet
the
latter
enterprise
has
been
carried
out
whether
by
john
smith
or
john
beelzebub
by
the
rev
jones
or
the
rev
belphegor
it
matters
not
now
some
one
has
carried
his
congenial
virus
round
the
globe
and
tainted
a
young
nation
it
is
no
question
of
doctrine
there
is
a
greater
difference
between
the
presbyterian
and
episcopalian
creeds
than
between
the
latter
and
the
catholic
but
in
tracing
sectarian
animosities
back
to
their
source
you
may
always
expect
to
crash
up
against
vested
interests
for
instance
the
great
fact
of
the
english
reformation
was
the
confiscation
of
church
property
afterward
a
protestant
england
submitted
peaceably
to
the
inquisition
but
when
mary
proposed
restitution
of
the
abbey
tenures
whoop
to
your
tents
o
israel
the
noble
army
of
prospective
martyrs
could
conform
to
that
heresy
and
the
stubborn
tudor
had
to
back
down
again
wesleyanism
tapped
the
offertory
of
episcopalianism
and
thus
earned
the
undying
hatred
of
that
church
though
in
point
of
doctrine
the
two
are
practically
identical
but
the
prejudice
of
the
irish
protestant
against
the
irish
catholic
has
the
basest
origin
of
all
the
english
and
scotch
colonists
drafted
into
ulster
by
elizabeth
james
i
cromwell
and
william
iii
always
evinced
a
tendency
to
become
irish
in
the
second
generation
the
reason
is
plain
the
cult
of
fear
was
the
territorial
religion
of
ireland
and
in
this
bitter
fellowship
native
catholic
and
acclimatised
protestant
sank
their
small
sectarian
differences
the
almighty
and
eternal
landlord
of
course
was
the
power
who
had
to
be
placated
by
tribute
and
incense
approached
on
all
fours
and
glorified
in
the
highest
we
do
know
much
of
the
history
of
ireland
during
the
century
and
indeed
there
is
not
much
to
be
known
an
irish
parliament
consisting
solely
of
landlords
and
their
nominees
legislated
as
men
do
when
the
personal
equation
is
allowed
to
pass
unchecked
meanwhile
the
agent
collected
such
rents
as
he
could
get
with
an
occasional
charge
of
slugs
thrown
in
gratis
and
the
finest
peasantry
in
the
world
slaved
starved
lied
stole
attended
the
means
of
grace
got
drunk
as
often
as
possible
married
and
gave
in
marriage
harnessed
itself
to
the
landlord
carriage
whenever
that
divinity
deigned
an
avatar
and
hoarded
up
its
pennies
for
the
annual
confiscation
broadly
speaking
it
rendered
unto
caesar
the
things
that
were
caesar
and
unto
god
the
things
that
were
god
conditions
being
so
arranged
that
caesar
title
covered
everything
except
an
insignificant
of
atrophied
souls
however
we
are
concerned
only
with
ulster
where
the
native
element
of
population
oblivious
to
thrift
and
instinctively
loyal
to
anything
in
the
shape
of
supremacy
had
become
alloyed
with
an
ingredient
derived
from
the
most
contumacious
brood
at
that
tirne
in
western
europe
namely
the
a
people
unpleasantly
apt
in
drawing
a
to
aggression
on
its
pocket
and
by
no
means
likely
to
content
itself
with
an
appeal
to
the
saints
or
the
muses
but
was
there
no
sectarian
line
of
cleavage
was
there
no
party
spirit
abroad
seeing
that
for
the
alleged
safety
of
the
protestant
population
the
catholics
lived
under
severe
penal
laws
well
hold
the
right
of
private
judgment
in
matters
of
religion
to
be
equally
sacred
in
others
as
in
ourselves
and
as
men
as
christians
and
as
protestants
we
rejoice
in
the
relaxation
of
the
penal
laws
against
our
roman
catholic
and
we
believe
the
measure
to
be
fraught
with
the
happiest
consequences
to
the
union
and
prosperity
of
ireland
that
is
part
of
a
resolution
carried
with
only
two
dissentient
voices
in
a
meeting
composed
of
the
delegates
of
corps
of
ulster
volunteers
numbering
men
the
meeting
was
held
at
dungannon
tyrone
in
the
volunteers
were
tenants
who
in
had
spontaneously
enrolled
themselves
for
defence
against
foreign
invasion
all
protestants
of
course
inasmuch
as
the
possession
of
arms
except
by
special
license
was
prohibited
to
catholics
though
at
this
time
the
american
war
being
then
in
progress
the
feeling
of
the
irish
protestant
was
strongly
revolutionary
while
the
irish
catholic
true
to
his
fatal
instinct
of
illogical
veneration
was
distinctly
loyalist
otherwise
the
bond
of
a
common
nationality
had
overborne
sectarian
estrangement
and
never
before
or
since
has
ireland
seen
a
period
when
the
professors
of
those
hostile
creeds
got
drunk
together
in
such
amity
this
is
a
historical
fact
which
can
not
be
too
often
repeated
at
no
period
since
the
days
of
constantine
says
the
accomplished
and
trustworthy
lecky
catholicism
so
free
from
domineering
and
aggressive
tendencies
as
during
the
pontificates
of
benedict
xiv
and
his
three
successors
this
covers
a
period
extending
from
to
and
we
know
that
cycles
of
ecclesiastical
polity
never
close
abruptly
the
catholic
was
first
to
perceive
that
lenity
and
cruelty
play
for
a
kingdom
the
gentler
gamester
is
the
soonest
winner
but
the
volunteers
armed
and
organised
without
the
invitation
or
concurrence
of
government
now
began
to
propose
reforms
in
parliamentary
representation
amendments
in
internal
legislation
a
relaxation
of
trade
restrictions
so
it
was
time
for
the
man
with
a
stake
in
the
country
to
think
about
doing
something
divide
and
govern
a
good
ideal
though
not
a
new
one
and
providentially
here
was
the
latent
spark
of
religious
dissent
ready
to
respond
to
the
foulest
breath
ever
blown
from
the
lips
of
greed
in
the
spark
was
first
fanned
into
flame
with
the
best
results
then
the
satisfactory
working
of
the
experiment
being
assured
the
first
orange
lodge
was
formally
inaugurated
at
loughlea
armagh
in
exactly
years
after
the
dethronement
and
expulsion
of
james
ii
and
years
after
the
death
of
william
of
orange
patronised
by
noblemen
gentlemen
clergymen
and
intermediary
pimps
of
substantial
position
the
institution
naturally
appealed
to
the
highest
sentiments
which
is
saying
extremely
little
of
a
protestant
forced
into
servility
by
agrarian
conditions
soon
it
became
and
waxed
mighty
in
the
land
feeding
itself
with
fresh
vendetta
from
each
recurring
of
july
observe
its
origin
well
the
profound
cunning
of
a
propertied
class
operating
with
sinister
purpose
on
the
inevitable
flunkeyism
of
a
dependent
class
per
medium
of
that
moral
kink
in
human
nature
which
makes
sectarian
persecution
an
act
of
worship
generated
an
accordant
monster
hence
any
convocation
however
slenderly
attended
may
fitly
be
called
a
monster
meeting
the
domestic
history
of
the
movement
in
its
palmy
days
the
brutal
and
cowardly
baiting
of
a
penalised
class
the
boorish
insult
to
ideals
held
sacred
by
sensitive
devotees
the
deliberate
cultivation
of
intra
parochial
the
savage
fostering
of
hate
for
hate
own
sake
the
thousand
squalid
details
of
affray
ambuscade
murder
maltreatment
malicious
injury
to
property
these
happily
or
unhappily
rest
on
oral
tradition
alone
but
the
whole
record
though
not
the
most
flagrant
in
modern
history
is
undeniably
the
vilest
asks
job
bring
a
clean
thing
out
of
an
unclean
and
his
answer
is
superfluous
a
fixed
resolution
to
avoid
the
very
appearance
of
digression
in
these
annals
prevents
my
referring
to
various
sporadic
irish
combinations
of
the
century
whiteboys
steelboys
oakboys
boys
defenders
some
catholic
some
protestant
some
mixed
but
each
representing
an
inarticulate
protest
against
agrarian
or
ecclesiastical
aggression
notice
however
that
the
customary
dragging
in
of
these
irrelevancies
to
confuse
the
main
issue
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
seeing
that
orangeism
itself
is
based
in
a
large
general
way
on
the
bible
but
again
what
fanatical
lunacy
or
of
christendom
was
ever
based
on
anything
else
o
catholic
and
protestant
slaves
of
dogma
zealots
idumaeans
partisans
of
ye
know
not
what
fools
all
whooping
for
your
ananus
your
john
of
giscala
your
simon
of
bargioras
and
fighting
amongst
yourselves
whilst
the
invincible
legionaries
of
science
advance
confidently
on
your
polluted
temple
small
sympathy
have
ye
from
this
josephus
but
rory
poor
fellow
had
all
the
impressions
of
party
spirit
built
into
his
moral
system
it
was
a
vital
and
personal
fact
to
him
though
only
a
historical
truth
to
me
that
this
hereditary
war
of
the
and
had
been
conducted
by
our
own
immediate
forefathers
strictly
speaking
mind
you
neither
party
cracked
the
egg
that
too
dainty
product
being
taboo
for
rent
but
they
compromised
by
cracking
each
other
domes
of
thought
rory
could
get
away
from
the
strong
probability
that
my
grandfather
had
overpowered
his
own
contemporary
ancestor
in
the
name
of
the
glorious
pious
and
immortal
memory
and
had
chopped
his
head
off
with
a
spade
he
was
willing
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
but
no
more
o
that
an
thou
lovest
me
yet
he
showed
a
distinctly
intelligent
interest
as
well
as
a
complacent
assent
when
i
pointed
out
to
him
the
irony
of
the
situation
england
original
title
to
the
of
ireland
and
a
perfectly
valid
one
as
times
went
then
was
the
momentous
bull
of
pope
adrian
iv
issued
to
henry
ii
in
and
any
private
title
to
land
in
ireland
traced
back
through
inheritance
purchase
or
what
not
must
lead
to
a
royal
grant
as
its
source
the
authority
for
such
grant
being
the
papal
bull
aforesaid
and
the
validity
of
the
bull
resting
on
the
pope
temporal
power
now
the
orangeman
is
prepared
to
die
in
his
last
in
vindication
of
the
english
domination
that
rests
on
the
papal
bull
that
is
warranted
by
the
pope
temporal
power
that
lay
in
the
house
that
peter
built
to
be
sure
provided
a
title
be
safe
its
value
is
not
affected
though
it
may
have
emanated
from
the
father
of
lies
himself
but
we
should
frankly
say
so
rory
character
was
made
up
of
two
fine
elements
the
poetic
and
the
prosaic
but
these
were
not
compounded
there
was
a
dreamy
idealistic
rory
born
of
a
race
and
there
was
a
painfully
parsimonious
rory
trained
down
to
the
standard
of
a
model
the
first
was
of
imagination
all
compact
living
in
an
atmosphere
of
charms
fairies
poetic
justice
and
angelic
guidance
the
second
was
primed
with
homely
maxims
respecting
the
neglected
value
of
copper
currency
which
reminds
me
we
had
been
together
about
a
week
when
the
thresher
came
round
i
had
no
crop
of
my
own
the
wild
cattle
having
walked
over
the
fence
and
eaten
it
the
crop
of
course
not
the
fence
but
we
both
went
to
help
a
neighbour
i
was
deputed
to
sew
the
bags
and
rory
to
pull
out
the
tailings
and
bag
them
up
for
sending
through
again
i
noticed
that
the
fan
pulley
of
the
machine
was
secured
with
a
key
projecting
about
two
inches
beyond
the
end
of
the
shaft
and
as
this
was
close
beside
where
rory
was
kneeling
at
his
work
i
pointed
it
out
to
him
as
a
thing
that
meant
mischief
to
the
unwary
half
an
hour
afterward
there
was
a
yell
from
the
vicinity
of
the
fan
and
i
knew
that
the
key
had
found
rory
the
engine
driver
shut
off
at
once
and
i
made
for
the
fan
whipping
out
my
pocket
knife
as
i
went
the
key
had
snatched
the
sleeve
of
the
young
fellow
homespun
linen
shirt
midway
between
elbow
and
shoulder
twitching
the
strong
fabric
into
a
knot
and
burrowing
into
the
soft
meat
of
his
arm
already
the
fan
was
pulled
up
while
the
belt
slipped
and
smoked
on
the
drum
pulley
above
the
blade
of
my
knife
was
just
touching
the
twisted
nucleus
of
linen
when
rory
exclaimed
wildly
aisy
tammas
for
marcy
sake
do
ca
ye
take
the
shurt
aff
the
nail
without
cuttin
it
at
this
moment
the
engine
driver
threw
the
fan
belt
off
and
rory
was
soon
liberated
his
satisfaction
at
finding
the
garment
almost
uninjured
was
but
slightly
dashed
by
the
bruise
on
his
arm
the
latter
would
heal
of
itself
the
former
would
but
for
the
rest
of
the
day
he
kept
his
eye
on
that
key
among
the
few
things
he
brought
out
with
him
from
home
was
the
habit
of
sleeping
in
his
skin
a
usage
by
the
way
more
to
be
commended
than
the
converse
custom
practised
by
english
of
turning
into
the
blankets
and
out
again
fully
dressed
till
the
raiment
never
removed
rots
off
by
effluxion
of
time
rory
maintained
that
his
system
added
considerably
to
the
lifetime
of
a
shirt
however
one
sunday
forenoon
while
we
were
enjoying
that
second
sleep
which
gives
to
the
day
of
rest
its
true
significance
the
smouldering
fire
ate
its
way
through
the
side
of
the
log
chimney
and
caught
a
couple
of
hundred
shingles
stacked
in
the
angle
outside
it
was
about
ten
when
rory
was
awakened
by
a
crackling
sound
close
beside
him
and
the
first
sight
he
saw
was
a
broad
tongue
of
flame
leaping
in
under
the
eave
and
licking
the
rafter
above
his
head
he
had
heard
of
bush
fires
and
though
he
knew
the
locusts
were
starving
on
the
surrounding
plain
his
roar
of
despair
brought
me
to
my
feet
on
the
floor
immediately
grasping
the
situation
and
a
shovel
i
called
on
him
to
bring
a
bucket
of
water
the
barrel
was
empty
as
a
matter
of
course
and
rory
cantered
away
down
the
road
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
where
a
deep
replenished
by
the
rain
before
referred
to
furnished
our
supply
but
in
the
panic
of
the
moment
it
escaped
his
observation
that
he
was
affording
a
scandalous
spectacle
to
two
of
assorted
cornish
people
on
their
way
to
the
local
tabernacle
in
fact
he
had
swooped
up
a
bucket
of
water
and
turned
back
with
it
before
he
was
aware
that
they
had
been
close
behind
him
all
the
time
his
first
thought
was
to
squat
down
taking
cover
behind
the
bucket
but
remembering
the
exigency
of
his
errand
he
girded
up
his
fortitude
which
was
the
only
thing
he
had
to
gird
and
faced
the
springcarts
for
the
sake
of
my
hut
as
bravely
as
his
ancestors
had
faced
earcropping
and
similar
cajoleries
for
the
sake
of
the
wan
thrue
church
and
there
was
no
more
joke
about
the
later
martyrdom
than
about
the
earlier
however
by
the
time
he
returned
i
had
thrown
the
burning
shingles
to
a
safer
distance
and
removed
all
the
loose
fire
so
that
the
bucket
of
water
made
everything
safe
owing
to
the
fire
being
on
the
side
of
the
hut
furthest
from
the
road
the
never
noticed
it
hence
they
assumed
that
rory
was
casually
bringing
the
water
for
domestic
purposes
and
their
unavoidable
inference
placed
the
irish
catholics
on
a
lower
moral
plane
than
the
aborigines
by
reason
of
their
priests
keeping
them
in
ignorance
this
misconception
had
acquired
all
the
solidity
of
fact
before
it
reached
me
consequently
my
explanation
was
received
as
a
fib
anyway
these
details
will
give
you
some
idea
of
rory
in
his
natural
state
as
a
colonist
after
the
first
fortnight
or
so
i
frankly
told
him
that
though
nothing
would
suit
my
own
interests
better
than
a
lifelong
extension
of
his
assistance
i
would
advise
him
to
stay
as
there
could
be
no
wages
forthcoming
i
had
absolutely
no
money
nor
was
i
likely
to
have
such
a
thing
in
my
possession
till
the
paddock
was
fenced
ploughed
and
sowed
and
the
crop
if
any
harvested
and
sold
even
then
taking
the
average
of
the
district
i
could
expect
a
return
of
more
than
and
out
of
this
i
would
have
to
pay
off
an
accumulated
shortage
of
about
it
a
quare
quare
counthry
anyhow
sadly
soliloquised
the
exile
of
erin
after
he
had
thought
the
matter
over
wondhers
niver

an

furbye
money
in
his
pocket
bates
all
bates
all
but
the
anomalous
and
baffling
nature
of
australian
conditions
made
rory
all
the
more
reluctant
to
tear
himself
away
from
his
present
asylum
though
its
shelter
seemed
to
resemble
the
shadow
of
a
great
deficit
in
an
insolvent
land
so
another
fortnight
passed
whilst
each
of
us
learned
something
from
the
other
i
constantly
endeavoured
by
reminiscence
and
inference
to
post
him
up
in
the
usages
of
his
adopted
country
and
he
regaled
me
with
the
of
the
where
his
ancestors
had
passively
resisted
extinction
since
the
time
of
japhet
purposeless
fairy
tales
and
profitless
ghost
stories
for
the
most
part
with
another
class
of
legend
equally
fatuous
but
ah
how
legitimately
born
of
that
auroral
fancy
which
ceases
not
to
play
above
the
grave
of
homely
ambition
penury
crushed
and
dead
legends
wherein
the
unvarying
motif
was
a
dazzling
cash
advance
made
by
satan
in
for
the
soul
of
some
rustic
delivery
being
due
in
seven
years
from
date
and
a
clever
repudiation
of
covenant
with
consequent
of
ensuing
clip
always
came
as
a
climax
so
that
the
defaulter
lived
happy
ever
after
while
the
outwitted
speculator
retired
to
his
own
penal
establishment
in
shame
and
confusion
of
tail
at
last
a
queer
thing
happened
i
received
a
letter
containing
a
bank
draft
for
from
a
friend
to
whom
i
had
lent
the
money
three
years
before
on
the
diggings
in
case
there
might
have
been
some
mistake
about
the
remittance
that
draft
was
cashed
before
the
postmaster
had
missed
me
from
the
window
and
i
was
on
the
way
home
before
the
bank
manager
thought
i
was
clear
of
his
porch
on
the
same
evening
i
placed
one
of
the
notes
in
rory
hand
adjuring
him
not
to
let
the
storekeeper
know
anything
about
it
but
to
depart
from
me
while
he
was
safe
he
shrank
from
the
note
as
from
a
lizard
while
his
lip
quivered
and
he
tried
to
swallow
his
emotion
down
then
ensued
mutual
expostulation
which
he
terminated
by
producing
a
knitted
purse
which
might
have
belonged
to
his
grandfather
or
to
brian
boru
grandfather
for
that
matter
and
disclosing
a
hidden
treasure
of
seven
shillings
two
sixpences
and
ten
coppers
i
nearly
hit
him
in
the
mere
fury
of
pity
ultimately
however
my
superior
force
of
character
told
its
tale
and
we
added
the
note
to
his
reserve
fund
i
got
him
started
next
morning
i
gave
him
my
shakespear
as
a
keepsake
with
a
billy
and
pannikin
and
a
few
days
rations
i
made
up
his
swag
scientifically
while
he
lay
on
his
bunk
then
i
walked
with
him
to
the
echuca
road
so
he
sorrowed
his
way
northward
in
renewed
search
of
his
brother
larry
and
as
i
watched
his
diminishing
figure
i
prayed
that
he
might
be
enticed
into
the
most
shocking
company
in
echuca
and
be
made
fightably
drunk
and
fall
in
for
a
remembersome
hammering
and
get
robbed
of
everything
and
be
given
in
charge
for
making
a
disturbance
and
wind
up
the
adventure
with
a
month
in
her
majesty
jail
it
seemed
to
me
that
no
milder
dispensation
of
providence
would
satisfy
his
moral
requirements
drastic
but
such
is
life
i
had
a
letter
from
him
a
month
afterward
but
as
the
postmark
was
hopelessly
illegible
and
as
he
had
omitted
to
head
the
communication
with
any
address
and
as
he
referred
to
the
place
where
he
was
working
as
the
station
mentioning
no
names
except
those
of
his
i
had
to
withhold
the
response
for
which
his
forlorn
soul
craved
takes
a
lot
of
different
sorts
of
people
to
make
a
world
observed
williamson
referring
to
the
hero
of
my
reminiscences
original
remark
commented
ward
and
it
seems
to
me
that
people
as
much
alike
as
sheep
and
dan
just
one
of
the
flock
i
always
speak
of
a
man
as
i
find
him
another
original
remark
said
broome
but
there
greater
fools
than
dan
if
you
only
knew
where
to
drop
across
them
original
remark
number
three
put
in
andrews
who
was
five
years
older
than
any
of
the
boys
you
all
chaps
of
great
experience
speaking
of
dan
as
you
call
him
said
i
by
the
foot
we
recognise
the
hercules
and
if
he
knows
as
much
about
all
other
historical
subjects
as
he
does
about
cawnpore
and
the
american
presidents
he
must
have
ripened
into
an
extraordinary
man
but
then
an
extraordinary
man
should
have
learned
the
difference
between
mallee
and
yarran
in
five
years
of
solid
scrub
observation
well
you
are
gauging
him
by
a
standard
that
foreign
to
his
class
of
mind
replied
andrews
if
he
had
been
as
strange
to
that
gilgie
as
you
were
and
had
got
the
same
directions
he
gave
you
he
would
have
found
it
first
shot
when
a
certain
class
of
bushman
says
he
means
any
sort
of
scrub
except
lignum
and
when
he
says
he
means
any
tree
except
pine
or
currajong
same
mental
slovenliness
in
women
a
woman
will
tell
a
yarn
that
no
man
can
make
head
or
tail
of
but
it
as
clear
as
day
to
any
other
woman
and
if
you
tell
a
woman
a
yarn
as
it
ought
to
be
told
she
think
she
understands
it
and
you
think
so
too
if
she
says
nothing
but
if
she
chances
any
remark
about
it
you
see
that
the
correctness
of
style
has
carried
it
over
her
head
speaking
of
style
reminds
me
that
dan
a
bit
of
an
author
remarked
williamson
one
day
i
was
in
his
place
and
he
casually
showed
me
a
page
of
some
treatise
he
on
of
evenings
and
my
word
the
style
was
grand
knocks
ouida
into
a
cocked
hat
well
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
i
observed
useful
sort
of
man
on
the
station
too
i
should
imagine
average
or
better
replied
andrews
nothing
brilliant
but
careful
and
trustworthy
revolves
in
his
orbit
without
a
perturbation
i
suggested
how
far
is
his
hut
from
here
twelve
mile
let
see
six
or
eight
mile
of
where
you
dropped
the
first
lot
of
wire
that
time
ca
i
take
him
on
the
way
to
mulppa
yes
but
do
trust
him
for
directions
beyond
his
own
place
we
give
you
the
geography
better
put
up
at
his
place
and
you
reach
mulppa
in
good
time
evening
and
look
out
for
that
dog
of
yours
when
you
get
in
range
of
dan
place
he
great
on
strychnine
and
the
station
gets
the
benefit
of
it
in
two
ways
he
keeps
his
paddock
clear
of
dingoes
and
he
never
has
a
scalp
to
sell
by
this
time
breakfast
was
concluded
and
in
two
minutes
the
combined
topographical
knowledge
of
the
young
fellows
had
laid
down
the
best
route
to
mulppa
via
dan
hut
then
a
short
official
interview
with
spanker
followed
by
a
long
desultory
gossip
brought
me
another
couple
of
hours
nearer
the
final
reward
of
my
orthodox
upbringing
in
another
hour
my
horses
were
saddled
and
i
was
having
a
drink
of
tea
and
a
bit
of
brownie
in
the
men
hut
a
few
minutes
afterward
cleopatra
was
shaking
this
refreshment
well
down
by
means
of
the
exercise
with
which
he
habitually
opened
the
day
work
but
this
was
to
be
accepted
in
the
same
spirit
as
the
abusive
language
of
a
faithful
pastor
it
was
all
in
the
contract
i
had
made
a
rule
of
backing
him
only
on
loose
or
in
soft
swamps
for
the
first
fortnight
by
that
time
an
amicable
understanding
had
been
established
between
us
at
an
expense
of
only
three
spills
once
through
an
unexpected
change
of
tactics
once
through
my
own
negligence
and
once
in
spite
of
my
best
endeavours
for
the
faithless
swamp
was
dry
i
dare
say
i
might
have
gradually
weaned
him
from
his
besetting
sin
but
i
did
want
to
be
pestered
with
people
borrowing
him
however
before
midday
i
was
out
on
the
track
along
which
i
had
started
with
the
wire
nearly
three
years
before
here
and
there
the
marks
of
the
wagon
were
still
identifiable
where
the
long
team
and
heavy
load
had
cut
off
corners
of
the
winding
track
presently
the
heavy
diverged
to
the
right
and
disappeared
in
the
scrub
then
the
faint
track
became
suddenly
fainter
where
half
the
scanty
traffic
branched
off
to
the
left
in
the
direction
of
lindsay
paddock
it
is
not
in
our
cities
or
townships
it
is
not
in
our
agricultural
or
mining
areas
that
the
australian
attains
full
consciousness
of
his
own
nationality
it
is
in
places
like
this
and
as
clearly
here
as
at
the
centre
of
the
continent
to
me
the
monotonous
variety
of
this
interminable
scrub
has
a
charm
of
its
own
so
grave
subdued
so
alien
to
the
genial
appeal
of
more
winsome
landscape
or
the
assertive
grandeur
of
mountain
and
gorge
to
me
this
wayward
diversity
of
spontaneous
plant
life
bespeaks
an
unconfined
ungauged
potentiality
of
resource
it
unveils
an
ideographic
prophecy
painted
by
nature
in
her
impressionist
mood
to
be
deciphered
aright
only
by
those
willing
to
discern
through
the
crudeness
of
dawn
a
promise
of
majestic
day
eucalypt
conifer
mimosa
tree
shrub
heath
in
endless
diversity
and
exuberance
yet
sheltering
little
of
animal
life
beyond
and
belated
types
anachronistic
even
to
the
aboriginal
savage
faithfully
and
lovingly
interpreted
what
is
the
latent
meaning
of
it
all
our
virgin
continent
how
long
has
she
tarried
her
bridal
day
pause
and
think
how
she
has
waited
in
serene
loneliness
while
the
deltas
of
nile
euphrates
and
ganges
expanded
inch
by
inch
to
spacious
provinces
and
the
yellow
sea
shallowed
up
with
the
silt
of
winters
innumerable
waited
while
the
primordial
civilisations
of
copt
accadian
aryan
and
mongol
crept
out
step
by
step
from
paleolithic
silence
into
the
uncertain
record
of
tradition
earliest
fable
waited
still
through
the
long
eras
of
successive
empires
while
the
light
broadening
little
by
little
moved
westward
westward
round
the
circumference
of
the
planet
at
last

moods

beneficent

whilst
the
interminable
procession
of

diurnal
alternations
lapsed
unrecorded
into
a
dead
past
bequeathing
no
register
of

present
the
mind

from
such
speculation
unsatisfied
but
impressed
gravely
impressed
for
this
recordless
land
this
land
of
our
lawful
solicitude
and
imperative
responsibility

exempt
from
many

bane

she

the

itself
since
no

one
perennial
truth

namely
that
every

may
be
traced
back
to
the

sins
of
aggression
and
submission

dan
paddock
lay
to
my
route
his
hut
being
about
midway
down
the
line
of
fence
on
striking
the
corner
of
the
paddock
i
went
through
a
gate
and
was
closing
and
securing
it
behind
bunyip
and
pup
when
i
became
aware
of
a
blackbearded
man
on
a
fat
bay
horse
approaching
along
the
inside
of
the
fence
rory
said
i
inquiringly
a
ken
crarit
it

exclaimed
the
evergreen
grasping
my
proffered
hand
while
his
face
became
transformed
with
delight
you
so
much
changed
said
i
so
manly
and
sunburnt
and
bearded
like
the
patriarchs
of
old
that
i
did
know
you
when
i
brought
that
wire
but
i
wonder
how
you
failed
to
recognise
me
considering
that
you
heard
my
name
och
man
dear
a
thought
ye
wur

he
replied
an
collins
is
a
purty
common
name
so
it
is
an
a
did
hear
yer
name
at
all
at
all
but
ye
stap
wi
me
the
night
an
we
hev
a
graat
cronia
about
oul
times
that
just
what
i
was
looking
forward
to
rory
which
way
are
you
going
now
no
matther
tammas
a
turn
back
wi
ye
an
we
git
home
a
brave
while
afore
sundown
so
we
rode
slowly
side
by
side
along
the
narrow
clearing
which
extended
in
endless
perspective
down
the
line
of
fence
after
giving
rory
a
sketch
of
the
vicissitudes
and
disasters
which
had
imparted
an
element
of
variety
to
the
thirteen
preceding
years
of
my
life
i
yielded
myself
to
the
lulling
influence
of
his
own
history
during
the
same
period
as
you
might
expect
he
glanced
lightly
over
all
points
of
real
interest
and
dwelt
interminably
on
the
statistics
of
the
station
such
as
the
percentage
of
lambs
for
each
year
since
the
stock
was
put
on
the
happily
decreasing
loss
by
dingoes
the
average
clip
per
head
and
all
manner
of
circumscribed
pastoral
shop
i
reined
our
conversation
round
to
the
future
prospects
and
possibilities
of
the
region
wherein
his
lot
was
cast
and
tried
to
steer
it
along
that
line
but
he
merely
took
the
country
as
he
found
it
and
left
things
at
that
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
a
physical
revolution
was
already
in
progress
that
the
introduction
of
sheep
meant
the
ultimate
extirpation
of
all
trees
and
scrubs
except
the
inedible
pine
and
that
the
perpetual
trampling
of
those
sharp
little
hoofs
would
in
time
caulk
the
spongy
absorbent
surface
so
that
these
fluffy
expanses
would
become
a
country
of
rich
and
spacious
plains
variegated
by
lakes
and
forests
and
probably
enjoying
a
fairly
equable
rainfall
i
have
reason
to
remember
that
i
quoted
sturt
account
of
the
old
man
plain
as
a
desert
solitude
of
the
most
hopeless
and
forbidding
character
but
as
i
pointed
out
settlement
had
crept
over
that
inhospitable
tract
and
the
old
man
plain
had
become
a
pastoral
paradise
with
a
possible
future
which
no
man
could
conjecture
then
i
was
going
on
to
cite
instances
within
my
own
knowledge
and
memory
of
permanent
lakes
formed
in
northern
victoria
and
a
climate
altered
for
the
better
by
mere
settlement
of
a
soil
antecedently
dessicated
and
disintegrated
by
idle
exposure
to
the
seasons
but
i
had
brought
round
the
subject
of
exploration
and
again
rory
amazed
me
by
the
extent
and
accuracy
of
his
information
glancing
from
sturt
to
eyre
he
firmly
yet
temperately
held
that
the
expedition
carried
out
by
this
explorer
along
the
shores
of
the
great
australian
bight
was
the
ablest
achievement
of
its
kind
on
record
and
he
forthwith
proceeded
to
substantiate
his
contention
by
a
consecutive
account
of
the
difficulties
met
and
surmounted
on
that
journey
also
he
expatiated
with
some
severity
on
the
slightness
of
public
information
with
respect
to
eyre
exploit
he
listened
with
kindly
toleration
whilst
i
adverted
to
the
excellent
work
of
more
recent
explorers
whose
discoveries
had
made
the
transcontinental
telegraph
line
a
feasible
undertaking
but
his
discursive
mind
ricochetted
off
to
the
laying
of
the
transatlantic
cable
in
and
he
dwelt
on
that
work
with
such
minuteness
of
detail
and
such
confident
mastery
of
names
dates
and
so
forth
that
i
not
his
disconcerting
fund
of
information
but
his
modest
reticence
on
other
subjects
of
interest
it
is
a
morally
upsetting
thing
for
instance
to
discover
that
the
unassuming
londoner
to
whom
you
have
been
somewhat
loosely
explaining
the
pedigrees
of
the
british
peerage
has
spent
most
of
his
life
as
a
clerk
in
the
heralds
college
but
i
noticed
a
growing
uneasiness
in
rory
manner
despite
his
efforts
towards
a
cordiality
at
last
he
said
deprecatingly
we
about
a
mile
aff
the
house
now
tammas
a
must
go
roun
be
a
tank
thonder
an
that
manes
lavin
ye
yer
lone
jist
go
sthraight
on
ye
come
till
the
fence
wi
a
wee
gate
in
the
corner
the
house
furnent
ye
an
ye
might
tell
hurself
a
be
home
atoast
sundown
he
shook
up
his
horse
and
dived
through
the
scrub
at
an
easy
trot
whilst
i
went
on
down
the
fence
before
i
had
gone
of
a
mile
my
attention
was
arrested
by
the
peculiar
hue
of
a
tall
pine
standing
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
from
the
fence
knowing
that
this
abnormal
deviation
in
colour
if
not
forthwith
inquired
into
would
harass
me
exceedingly
in
after
years
i
turned
aside
to
inspect
the
tree
it
was
worth
the
trouble
the
pine
had
been
dead
for
years
but
every
leafless
twig
right
up
to
its
spiry
summit
was
by
the
dense
foliage
of
a
giant
woodbine
which
embraced
the
trunk
with
three
clean
stems
each
as
thick
as
your
arm
no
moralist
worthy
of
the
name
could
fail
to
find
a
comprehensive
allegory
in
the
tree
but
i
had
scarcely
turned
away
from
it
before
my
meditations
were
disturbed
ten
or
fifteen
yards
distant
under
the
cool
shade
of
a
large
low
growing
wilga
i
observed
a
man
reclining
at
ease
a
tall
athletic
man
apparently
with
a
billy
and
beside
him
and
nothing
more
to
wish
for
when
i
caught
sight
of
him
he
was
in
the
act
of
settling
himself
more
comfortably
and
adjusting
his
hat
over
his
face
my
first
impulse
was
to
hail
him
with
a
friendly
greeting
but
a
scruple
of
punctilio
made
me
pause
the
clearing
of
rory
was
visible
here
and
there
through
gaps
in
the
scrub
even
the
hut
was
in
sight
from
my
own
point
of
view
the
sun
was
still
a
couple
of
hours
above
the
horizon
and
the
repose
of
the
wilga
shade
was
more
to
be
desired
than
the
activity
of
the
to
everything
there
is
a
time
and
a
season
and
the
tactical
moment
for
weary
approach
to
a
dwelling
is
just
when
fades
the
glimmering
landscape
on
the
sight
and
all
the
air
a
solemn
stillness
holds
so
after
a
moment
hesitation
my
instinctive
sense
of
bush
etiquette
caused
me
to
tum
stealthily
away
and
seek
the
wicket
gate
which
afforded
ingress
to
rory
but
i
want
you
to
notice
that
this
decision
was
preceded
by
a
poise
of
option
between
two
alternatives
now
mark
what
followed
for
like
falstaff
story
it
is
worth
the
marking
each
undertaking
great
or
small
of
our
lives
has
one
controlling
alternative
and
no
more
to
illustrate
this
from
the
play
of
hamlet
you
will
notice
that
up
to
a
certain
point
of
time
the
prince
governs
his
own
destiny
at
least
as
far
as
the
ghost
commission
is
concerned
and
this
covers
the
whole
drama
he
is
master
and
umpire
of
his
circumstances
so
that
when
two
or
more
lines
of
action
or
a
line
of
action
and
a
line
of
inaction
appear
equally
efficacious
he
can
select
the
one
which
appears
to
be
of
least
resistance
but
subsequent
to
that
point
of
time
he
is
no
longer
the
arbiter
of
his
own
situation
but
rather
the
puppet
of
circumstances
there
are
no
more
divergent
roads
if
he
desires
to
leave
the
one
he
has
chosen
he
must
break
blindly
through
a
hedge
of
moral
antagonisms
his
alternatives
have
become
so
lopsided
that
practically
there
is
only
one
course
open
the
initial
exercise
of
judgment
was
not
merely
an
antecedent
to
later
developments
of
the
plot
it
was
a
which
has
committed
the
hero
to
a
system
of
interlaced
contingencies
and
the
tendency
of
this
system
bears
him
away
of
his
own
impotence
to
where
the
rest
is
silence
the
is
where
hamlet
engages
the
players
to
enact
the
murder
of
gonzago
a
may
create
and
enclose
all
the
secondary
alternatives
of
after
life
a
may
exhaust
itself
in
one
minute
or
less
leaving
its
indelible
though
imperceptible
scar
on
the
experimenter
and
through
him
on
the
world
in
which
he
lives
the
is
the
shakespearian
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
often
recognised
though
not
formulated
in
any
case
each
alternative
brings
into
immediate
play
a
flash
of
pure
and
simple
which
instantly
gives
place
as
far
as
that
particular
section
of
life
is
concerned
to
the
dominion
of
what
we
call
destiny
the
two
should
never
be
confounded
who
can
control
his
fate
asks
the
ruined
othello
no
one
indeed
but
every
one
controls
his
option
chooses
his
alternative
othello
himself
had
independently
evolved
the
decision
which
fixed
his
fate
recognising
it
as
such
an
alternative
thus
put
out
the
light
and
then
put
out
the
light
if
i
quench
thee
thou
flaming
minister
i
can
again
thy
former
light
restore
should
i
repent
me
but
once
put
out
thy
light
thou
pattern
of
excelling
nature
i
know
not
where
is
the
promethean
heat
that
can
thy
light
relume
when
i
have
plucked
thy
rose
i
can
not
give
it
vital
growth
again
it
needs
must
wither
also
he
perceives
that
it
is
a
which
confronts
him
and
he
contrasts
this
with
the
supposititious
of
extinguishing
the
lamp
but
how
often
do
we
accept
a
whilst
innocently
oblivious
to
its
gravity
in
macbeth
the
alternatives
are
very
obvious
the
interest
of
the
play
centres
on
the
poise
of
incentive
between
action
and
and
the
absolute
of
election
but
that
election
once
made
we
see
and
the
hero
himself
acknowledges
a
practical
inevitableness
in
all
succeeding
atrocities
which
mark
his
career
as
king
such
momentous
alternatives
are
simply
the
voluntary
of
our
own
ends
whether
there
a
divinity
that
afterwards
shapes
them
is
a
question
which
each
inquirer
may
decide
for
himself
say
however
that
this
postulated
divinity
consists
of
the
universal
mind
and
that
the
universal
mind
comprises
the
aggregate
human
intelligence
with
some
moral
centre
beyond
and
that
the
spontaneous
sway
of
this
influence
is
toward
harmony
toward
the
smoothing
of
obstacles
the
healing
of
wounds
in
the
axiom
that
nature
reverts
to
the
norm
there
is
a
recognition
of
this
restorative
tendency
and
the
religious
aspect
of
the
same
truth
is
expressed
in
the
proverb
that
god
is
love
for
the
grass
will
grow
where
attila
horse
has
trod
while
that
objectionable
hun
himself
is
represented
by
a
of
useful
fertiliser
but
say
that
this
always
comes
about
by
law
of
cause
which
is
human
and
effect
which
is
destiny
never
by
sporadic
intervention
yet
a
certain
scar
tracing
its
origin
to
an
antecedent
alternative
will
remain
as
the
signet
of
that
limitation
under
which
the
divinity
works
the
limitation
namely
of
destiny
or
the
fixed
issue
of
present
effect
from
foregone
cause
such
cause
having
been
perpetually
directed
and
by
recurring
operation
of
individual
exercised
independently
by
those
emanations
from
the
moral
centre
which
by
courtesy
we
call
reasonable
beings
vague
yes
well
put
it
in
parable
form
a
young
man
has
reached
an
absolute
poise
of
incentive
he
tosses
a
shekel
head
i
go
and
see
life
tail
i
stay
at
home
head
it
is
the
alternative
is
accepted
whereupon
destiny
puts
in
her
spoke
bringing
such
vicissitudes
as
are
inevitable
on
the
initial
option
in
due
time
another
alternative
presents
itself
and
the
poise
of
incentive
recurs
the
prodigal
spits
on
a
chip
and
tosses
it
wet
i
crawl
back
home
dry
i
see
it
out
wet
it
is
so
he
goes
to
meet
the
ring
and
the
robe
and
the
fatted
calf
his
latter
alternative
has
taken
him
home
and
a
felicitous
option
on
the
old
man
part
has
given
him
a
welcome
but
the
earlier
alternative
is
following
him
up
for
the
farm
is
gone
the
old
man
himself
can
not
undo
the
effect
of
the
foregone
choice
or
put
it
in
allegorical
form
the
misty
expanse
of
futurity
is
radiated
with
divergent
lines
of
rigid
steel
and
along
one
of
these
lines
with
diminishing
carbon
and
sighing
exhaust
you
travel
at
schedule
speed
at
each
junction
you
switch
right
or
left
and
on
you
go
still
up
or
down
the
way
of
your
own
choosing
but
there
is
no
stopping
or
turning
back
and
until
you
have
passed
the
current
section
there
is
no
divergence
except
by
voluntary
catastrophe
another
junction
flashes
into
sight
and
again
your
choice
is
made
negligently
enough
perhaps
but
still
with
a
view
to
what
you
consider
the
greatest
good
present
or
prospective
one
line
may
lead
through
the
slough
of
despond
and
the
other
across
the
delectable
mountains
but
you
do
know
whether
the
section
will
prove
rough
or
smooth
or
whether
it
ends
in
a
junction
or
a
terminus
till
the
cloven
mists
of
the
future
melt
into
a
manifest
present
we
know
what
we
are
but
we
know
not
what
we
shall
be
often
the
shunting
seems
a
mere
trifle
but
in
reality
the
switch
is
that
which
brings
into
evidence
such
corollaries
of
life
as
felicity
or
misery
peace
or
tribulation
honour
or
ignominy
found
on
the
permanent
way
for
others
remember
as
well
as
for
ourselves
no
one
except
the
anchorite
lives
to
himself
and
he
is
merely
a
person
who
evades
his
responsibilities
here
and
there
you
find
a
curious
complication
of
lines
from
a
junction
in
front
there
stretches
out
into
the
mist
a
single
line
and
a
double
line
and
meantime
along
a
track
converging
toward
your

you
say
i

so
now
you
soon
have
a
long
train
of
empty

to
pull
up
the
gradients
and
while
you
snort
and
bark
under
a

your

occasionally
stimulate
you
with

when
this

told
you
so
to
change
the
metaphor
instead
of
remaining
a
lord

acting

not

of

the

to
promise
such
a

applied
to

theory
is
gratuitously
sound
beyond
that
it
is

however
all
this
must
be
taken
as
referring
back
to
my
own
apparently
insignificant
decision
not
to
disturb
the
masterly
inactivity
of
that
sundowner
under
the
wilga
mere
afterthoughts
introduced
here
by
reason
of
their
bearing
on
this
simple
chronicle
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
approached
rory
neat
hut
speculating
as
to
why
he
had
purposely
left
me
to
feel
my
own
way
i
soon
formed
a
good
rough
guess
a
child
in
a
vast
white
ran
toward
me
as
i
came
in
sight
but
presently
paused
and
returned
at
the
same
pace
on
reaching
the
door
i
was
met
by
a
woman
of
to
whom
i
introduced
myself
as
an
old
friend
of
deed
he
hes
plenty
o
frien
replied
the
woman
drily
are
ye
gunta
stap
the
night
well
was
kind
enough
to
proffer
his
hospitality
i
replied
pulling
the
off
bunyip
by
the
way
i
to
tell
you
that
he
be
home
presently
nat
a
fear
but
he
be
home
at
an
a
purty
house
he
got
fur
till
ax
a
sthranger
intil
now
it
the
loveliest
situation
i
seen
within
a
hundred
miles
i
replied
as
i
set
cleopatra
at
liberty
and
the
way
that
the
place
is
kept
reflects
the
very
highest
credit
upon
yourself
moreover
both
compliments
were
as
true
as
they
were
frank
dacent
enough
for
them
that
niver
been
used
till
betther
there
a
dale
in
how
a
body
rairt
true
i
sighed
i
sure
you
must
feel
it
but
my
word
you
can
grow
the
right
sort
of
children
here
how
old
is
the
little
girl
my
custom
is
to
ask
a
mother
the
age
of
her
child
and
then
express
incredulity
nor
she
good
she
was
five
on
the
thurteenth
iv
last
month
no
but
seriously
mrs
a
always
sayrious
about
telling
the
thruth
and
with
this
retort
courteous
the
impervious
woman
retired
into
her
house
while
i
seated
myself
on
the
bucket
stool
against
the
wall
and
proceeded
to
fill
my
pipe
we
got
six
goats
pure
angoras
remarked
the
little
girl
approaching
me
with
instinctive
courtesy
we
keep
them
for
milkin
an
daddy
shears
them
ivery
year
i
noticed
them
coming
along
i
replied
they
beautiful
goats
and
i
see
you
got
some
horses
too
yis
three
we
bought
wan
o
them

because

an
he
knows
iverything
yes
your
daddy
a
good
man
i
knew
him
long
long
ago
when
there
was
no
you
what
your
name
dear
mary
she
got
no
name
remarked
the
grim
voice
from
the
interior
of
the
house
and
the
mild
apologetic
glance
of
the
child
in
my
face
completed
a
mental
appraisement
of
rory
family
relations
half
an
hour
passed
pleasantly
enough
in
this
kind
of
conversation
then
rory
came
in
sight
at
the
wicket
gate
where
i
had
entered
mary
forgot
my
existence
in
a
moment
and
raced
toward
him
opening
a
conversation
at
the
top
of
her
voice
while
he
was
still
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
when
they
met
he
dismounted
and
placing
her
astride
on
the
saddle
continued
his
way
with
the
expression
of
a
man
whose
cup
of
happiness
is
wastefully
running
over
i
had
leisure
to
observe
the
child
critically
as
she
sat
bareheaded
beside
rory
at
the
glancing
from
time
to
time
at
me
for
the
tribute
of
admiration
due
to
each
remark
made
by
that
nonpareil
of
men
she
was
not
only
a
strikingly
beautiful
child
but
the
stamp
of
child
that
expands
into
a
beautiful
woman
in
spite
of
her
lineage
and
antipodean
birth
there
was
something
almost
amusing
in
the
strong
racial
index
of
her
pure
irish
face
the
black
hair
and
were
there
with
eyes
of
indescribable
blue
the
full
shapely
lips
and
that
delicate
contour
of
chin
which
specially
marks
the
highest
type
of
a
race
which
is
not
only
but
it
is
not
the
celtic
element
that
makes
the
irish
people
a
bundle
of
inconsistencies
clannish
yet
disjunctive
ardent
yet
unstable
faithful
yet
perfidious
exceeding
loveable
for
its
own
impulsive
love
yet
a
broken
reed
to
lean
upon
it
is
not
the
celt
who
has
made
irish
history
an
unexampled
record
of
patience
and
insubordination
of
devotion
and
treachery
the
celt
though
fiery
is
shrewd
sensible
and
practical
it
has
been
truly
said
that
western
britain
is
more
celtic
than
eastern
ireland
but
the
whole
mixture
is
a
thing
of
yesterday
before
the
eagle
of
the
tenth
legion
was
planted
on
the
shore
of
cantium
before
the
first
phoenician
ship
stowed
tin
at
the
cassiterides
the
celt
had
inhabited
the
british
islands
long
enough
to
branch
into
distinct
and
to
rise
from
paloeolithic
savagery
to
the
use
of
metals
the
domestication
of
animals
and
the
observance
of
elaborate
religious
rites
yet
relatively
this
antique
race
is
of
last
week
only
for
away
beyond
the
celt
paloeontology
finds
an
earlier
people
of
different
origin
and
physical
characteristics
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
forced
westward
by
celtic
invaders
of
more
virile
type
and
more
capable
of
organisation
that
immemorial
race
is
represented
by
the
true
irish
of
the
black
hair
associated
with
eyes
and
a
skin
of
extreme
whiteness
found
abundantly
in
ireland
and
amongst
the
offspring
of
irish
emigrants
are
in
all
probability
tokens
of
descent
from
this
appallingly
ancient
people
the
type
appears
occasionally
in
the
basque
provinces
and
on
the
atlantic
coast
of
morocco
but
nowhere
else
few
civilised
races
inhabit
the
land
where
the
fossil
relics
of
their
own
lineal
ancestors
mark
the
furthest
point
of
human
occupancy
yet
it
would
seem
to
be
so
with
the
true
irish
in
what
other
way
can
this
anomalous
variety
of
the
human
race
be
accounted
for
ay
and
beyond
the
earliest
era
noted
by
ethnography
this
original
race
must
have
differentiated
itself
from
the
unknown
archetype
and
by
mere
genealogical
succession
must
have
fixed
its
characteristics
so
tenaciously
as
to
persist
through
the
random
admixture
of
conquests
and
colonisations
during
countless
generations
god
is
eternal
says
a
fine
french
apothegm
but
man
is
very
old
and
very
new
mary
was
perfect
to
describe
her
from
she
was
a
very
creature
of
the
phenomena
which
had
environed
her
own
dawning
intelligence
she
was
a
child
of
the
wilderness
a
dryad
among
her
kindred
trees
the
poetry
of
her
nature
made
the
bush
vocal
with
pure
gladness
of
life
endowed
each
tree
with
sympathy
respondent
to
her
own
fellowship
she
had
noticed
the
dusky
aspect
of
the
ironwood
the
volumed
cumuli
of
rich
crowning
the
lordly
currajong
the
darker
shade
of
the
massy
the
clearer
tint
of
the
tapering
pine
the
column
of
the
leopard
tree
creamy
white
on
slate
from
base
to
topmost
twig
she
pitied
the
unlovely
belar
when
the
wind
sighed
through
its
coarse
scanty
tresses
and
she
loved
to
contemplate
the
silvery
plumage
of
the
two
drooping
myalls
which
because
of
their
rarity
here
had
been
allowed
to
remain
in
the
for
the
last
two
or
three
springs
of
her
vivacious
existence
she
had
watched
the
deepening
crimson
of
the
quondong
amidst
its
thick
contexture
of
leaves
she
had
marked
the
unfolding
bloom
of
the
scrub
in
its
beauty
she
had
revelled
in
the
audacious
glory
of
the
desert
pea
she
knew
the
of
every
loved
companion
and
by
necessity
she
had
her
own
names
for
them
all
since
her
explorations
were
carried
out
on
rory
shoulders
or
on
his
saddle
and
technicalities
never
troubled
him
to
her
it
was
a
new
world
and
she
saw
that
it
was
good
all
those
impressions
which
endear
the
memory
of
early
scenes
to
the
careworn
heart
were
hers
in
their
vivid
present
intensified
by
the
strong
ideality
of
her
nature
and
undisturbed
by
other
companionship
save
that
of
her
father
this
brings
us
to
the
other
mark
of
a
personality
so
freshly
minted
as
to
have
taken
no
more
than
two
impressions
rory
was
her
guide
philosopher
and
crony
he
was
her
overwhelming
ideal
of
power
wisdom
and
goodness
he
was
her
help
in
ages
past
her
hope
for
years
to
come
no
irreverence
intended
here
quite
the
reverse
for
if
true
family
life
existed
we
should
better
apprehend
the
meaning
of
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
he
was
her
ancient
of
days
her
shield
and
her
exceeding
great
reward
a
new
position
for
rory
and
he
grasped
it
with
all
the
avidity
of
a
soul
the
whole
current
of
his
affections
thwarted
and
repulsed
by
the
world
indifference
found
lavish
outlet
here
after
tea
rory
took
a
billy
and
went
out
into
the
to
milk
the
goats
mary
of
course
clinging
to
his
side
i
remained
in
the
house
confiding
to
the
high
respect
which
rory
principles
and
abilities
had
always
commanded
but
she
was
past
all
that
and
i
had
to
give
it
up
when
a
woman
can
listen
with
genuine
contempt
to
the
spontaneous
echo
of
her
husband
popularity
it
is
a
sure
sign
that
she
has
explored
the
profound
depths
of
masculine
worthlessness
and
there
is
no
known
antidote
to
this
fatal
enlightenment
rory
next
duty
was
to
chop
up
a
bit
of
firewood
and
stack
it
beside
the
door
dusk
was
gathering
by
this
time
and
called
mary
to
prepare
her
for
the
night
while
rory
and
i
seated
ourselves
on
the
outside
presently
a
lighted
lamp
was
placed
on
the
table
when
we
removed
indoors
then
mary
in
a
long
white
garment
with
her
innocent
face
shining
from
the
combined
effects
of
perfect
happiness
and
unmerciful
washing
climbed
on
rory
knees
not
to
bid
him
goodnight
but
to
compose
herself
to
sleep
time
the
chile
was
bruk
aff
that
habit
observed
the
mother
as
she
seated
herself
beside
the
table
with
some
sewing
let
her
be
a
child
as
long
as
she
can

remarked

rory
turning
to

on
the
most
salient
of
the
three

had

rouse
the
old

then

when
a

an
obvious
rejoinder
rose
to
my
mind
but
evidently
not
to
rory
for
the
look
on
his
face
told
only
of
a
dogged
resolution
to
continue
sinning
against
the
light
he
knew
that
his
own
contumacy
in
this
respect
would
land
his
soul
in
perdition
and
he
deliberately
let
it
go
at
that
brave
old
rory
never
does
erratic
man
appear
to
such
advantage
as
when
his
own
intuitive
moral
sense
rigorously
overbears
a
conscientiousness
warped
by
some
fallacy
which
he
still
accepts
as
truth
yet
the
mother
loved
the
child
in
her
own
hard
puritanical
way
and
in
any
case
you
are
not
competent
to
judge
her
unless
you
have
to
work
for
your
living
instead
of
finding
somebody
eager
to
support
you
in
luxury
for
the
pleasure
of
your
society
unless
instead
of
marrying
some
squatter
or
bank
clerk
or
member
of
parliament
you
have
inadvertently
coupled
yourself
to
a
catholic
boundary
man
named
nothing
short
of
rory
the
embittered
woman
retired
early
and
without
phrases
as
she
did
so
i
casually
noticed
that
the
was
bisected
by
a
partition
with
a
curtained
doorway
ever
try
your
hand
at
literature
rory
i
presently
asked
remembering
williamson
remark
well
a
ken

no
an
a

replied
rory
with
humility
a
got
a
bit
iv
a
thraytise
scribbled
down
furbye
a
wheen
o
other
wans
on
han
a

and
his
glance
rested
on
the
angelface
of
the
sleeping
child
well
a
thought
mebbe
it
would
do
hur
no

till
know
that

what

now
an
a

the

we
wur
mentionin
he
tenderly
carried
the
child
into
the
first
compartment
of
the
bedroom
and
soon
returning
placed
before
me
about
twenty
quarto
sheets
of
manuscript
written
on
both
sides
in
a
careful
schoolboy
hand
the
first
page
was
headed
a
plea
for
woman
my
word
rory
this
is
great
said
i
after
reading
the
first
long
paragraph
i
should
like
to
skim
it
over
at
once
to
get
the
gist
of
the
argument
and
then
read
it
leisurely
to
enjoy
the
style
and
that
reminds
me
that
i
brought
you
an
australasian
i
get
it
out
of
my
swag
and
you
can
read
it
to
kill
time
but
it
became
evident
that
he
could
fix
his
mind
on
the
newspaper
whilst
his
own
literary
product
was
under
scrutiny
the
latter
unfolded
itself
as
a
unique
example
of
pure
deduction
aided
by
utter
lack
of
discrimination
in
the
value
of
evidence
it
was
all
synthesis
and
no
analysis
a
certain
hypothesis
had
to
be
established
and
it
was
established
the
style
was
directly
antithetical
to
that
curt
blunt
and
simple
pronouncement
aimed
at
by
innocents
who
deceive
no
one
by
denouncing
socialism
over
the
signature
of
a
working
man
but
the
essay
i
am
debarred
from
transcribing
it
not
only
because
of
its
length
but
because
rory
you
must
let
me
take
a
copy
of
this
well
tammas
a
glad
it
plazes
ye
right
glad
so
a

but
a

till
till
spring
it
on
the
public
so
to
speak
yis
well
i
faithfully
promise
to
keep
the
whole
work
sacred
to
your
credit
and
if
ever
i
go
into
print
which
is
most
unlikely
i
refer
to
this
essay
in
such
a
way
as
to
whet
public
curiosity
to
a

if
anything
should

you

ye

time
afore
ye
go
the
object
of
the
essay
was
to
prove
that
at
a
certain
epoch
in
the
history
the
character
of
woman
had
undergone
an
instantaneous
transformation
and
it
was
proved
in
this
way
the
two
greatest
thinkers
and
most
infallible
authorities
our
race
has
produced
are
solomon
and
shakespear
solomon
estimate
of
woman
is
shockingly
low
and
there
is
no
getting
away
from
the
truth
of
it
his
baneful
evidence
has
the
guarantee
of
holy
writ
moreover
it
is
fully
borne
out
by
the
testimony
of
ancient
history
sacred
and
profane
and
by
the
tendency
of
the
greek
and
roman
mythologies
examples
here
quoted
in
profusion
the
fact
of
woman
wickedness
in
ancient
times
is
traceable
to
the
eating
of
the
apple
when
eve
being
the
more
culpable
was
justly
burdened
with
the
heavier
penalty
namely
a
preternatural
bias
toward
sin
in
a
general
way
on
the
other
hand
shakespear
estimate
of
woman
is
high
and
justly
so
since
his
valuation
is
conclusively
endorsed
by
modern
history
examples
again
quoted
in
convincing
volume
from
the
women
of
acts
down
to
chisholm
and
florence
nightingale
now
how
do
you
bring
these
two
apparently
conflicting
facts
into
the
harmony
of
context
simply
by
tracing
the
forward
and
the
backward
to
their
point
of
intersection
and
so
finding
the
moment
of
transition
it
is
where
the
virgin
says
my
soul
doth
magnify
the
lord
and
my
spirit
hath
rejoiced
in
god
my
saviour
for
he
hath
regarded
the
low
estate
of
his
handmaiden
for
behold
from
henceforth
all
generations
shall
call
me
blessed
this
prophecy
has
not
only
a
personal
and
specific
fulfilment
as
pointing
to
the
speaker
herself
but
a
transitive
and
general
application
as
referring
to
her
sex
at
large
there
you
have
it
but
no
mere
abstract
can
do
justice
to
the
sumptuous
phraseology
of
the
work
to
its
opulence
of
carefully
selected
adjective
or
to
the
involved
rhetoric
which
seemed
to
defeat
and
set
at
naught
all
your
petty
rules
of
syntax
and
prosody
still
less
can
i
impart
a
notion
of
the
exhaustive
raking
up
of
ancient
examples
and
modern
instances
mostly
worn
bright
by
familiarity
with
the
popular
mind
but
all
converging
toward
the
conclusion
striven
for
and
the
shakiest
of
them
accepted
in
childlike
faith
integrally
that
essay
conveyed
the
idea
of
two
mighty
glaciers
of
theory
each
impelling
its
own
moraine
of
facts
toward
a
stated
point
of
confluence
represented
by
a
magnificent
postulate
where
one
section
at
least
of
the
universal
plan
would
attain
fulfilment
and
the
eternal
unities
would
be
so
far
satisfied
there
was
something
in
it
that
was
more
like
an
elusive
glimmer
of
genius
than
an
evidence
of
understanding
or
still
less
of
cleverness
remarkable
also
that
though
the
punctuation
was
deplorable
every
superb
polysyllable
was
correctly
spelled
but
as
a
monument
of
wasted
ingenuity
and
industry
i
have
met
with
nothing
so
pathetic
a
long
term
of
in
the
back
country
will
never
leave
a
man
as
it
found
him
outside
his
daily
avocation
he
becomes
a
fool
or
a
philosopher
and
in
rory
case
the
latter
seemed
to
have
been
superimposed
on
the
former
at
ten
i
hunted
him
to
bed
i
had
plenty
of
blank
forms
in
my
and
on
these
i
took
a
preliminary
copy
of
a
plea
for
woman
this
occupied
about
three
hours
then
not
feeling
sleepy
i
took
down
one
of
four
books
which
i
had
previously
noticed
on
a
corner
shelf
it
was
my
own
old
shakespear
with
the
added
interest
of
marginal
marks
in
ink
of
three
colours
neatly
ordered
and
as
the
sand
by
the
innumerable
i
put
it
back
with
the
impression
that
no
book
had
ever
been
better
placed
the
next
volume
was
a
bible
presented
by
the
reverend
miles
barton
rector
of
tanderagee
county
armagh
ireland
to
his
beloved
parishioner
deborah
johnson
on
the
occasion
of
her
departure
for
melbourne
south
australia
june
the
third
book
was
a
fairly
good
dictionary
appendixed
by
a
copious
glossary
of
the
greek
and
roman
mythologies
the
fourth
was
vol
xii
of
macmillan
magazine
may
to
october
opening
the
latter
book
at
random
i
fell
upon
a
sketch
of
eyre
expedition
along
the
shores
of
the
great
australian
bight
in
another
place
was
a
contribution
entitled
gallery
of
american
presidents
the
next
item
of
interest
was
an
account
of
the
massacre
of
cawnpore
and
toward
the
end
of
the
volume
was
a
narrative
of
the
atlantic
telegraph
expedition
of
course
there
were
thirty
or
forty
other
articles
in
the
book
but
they
were
mostly
strange
to
me
however
familiar
they
might
be
to
rory
hopeless
case
i
thought
as
i
blew
out
the
lamp
and
turned
into
my
comfortable
if
this
morepoke
irish
love
of
knowledge
was
backed
by
one
spark
of
mental
enterprise
he
might
have
half
a
ton
of
chosen
literature
to
come
and
go
on
and
here
he
is
with
his
pristine
ignorance
merely
dislocated
when
i
woke
at
sunrise
rory
was
kindling
the
fire
with
the
inseparable
mary
squatted
beside
him
in
her
nightgown
after
putting
on
the
kettle
he
dressed
the
little
girl
and
helped
her
to
wash
her
face
by
this
time
i
was
about
and
mary
brought
me
a
blank
form
which
i
had
dropped
and
overlooked
the
night
before
keep
it
till
you
learn
to
write
dear
said
i
she
ken
write
now
remarked
rory
with
subdued
exultation
here
jewel
he
continued
handing
her
a
pencil
from
the
mantelpiece
write
yer
name
nately
on
that
paper
fur
misther
collins
till
see
the
child
tremulous
with
an
ecstatic
sense
of
responsibility
bent
over
her
paper
on
the
table
for
a
full
minute
then
diffidently
pushed
it
across
to
me
and
i
read
in
strong
roman
capitals
the
inscription
mray
with
the
m
containing
an
extra
angle
being
so
to
speak
a
letter
and
a
half
ye
wake
in
spellin
honey
remarked
her
father
merrily
an
the
m
got
an
exthry
knuckle
on
it
it
right
enough
i
interposed
could
be
better
now
mary
i
keep
this
paper
and
show
it
to
you
again
when
you
a
great
scholar
and
a
great
poetess
see
if
i
do
the
entrance
of
cut
short
this
nonsense
and
rory
went
out
to
milk
the
goats
accompanied
of
course
by
mary
after
breakfast
we
took
our
bridles
and
went
out
toward
where
the
five
horses
were
feeding
together
the
inevitable
child
pattering
along
by
rory
side
you
have
a
lot
to
be
thankful
for
i
remarked
blessed
be
his
name
thought
rory
aloud
and
i
continued
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
send
her
away
to
school
in
another
four
or
five
years
iv
coorse
replied
rory
sadly
a
convent
school
mind
none
of
your
common
boarding
schools
for
a
child
like
mary
rory
only
reply
was
a
glance
of
gratitude
my
stern
admonition
would
be
a
moral
support
to
him
in
the
coming
controversy
you
mentioned
some
other
literary
work
that
you
have
on
hand
i
remarked
inquiringly
yis
a
jotted
down
a
few
idays
now
tammas
where
was
the
garden
of
aden
supposed
to
be
my
word
rory
if
a
man
could
only
disclose
that
to
the
world
he
would
command
attention
however
one
theory
is
that
it
was
on
the
lost
continent
of
atlantis
another
that
it
was
in
the
valley
of
cashmere
there
are
many
other
localities
suggested
but
i
think
the
one
which
meets
most
favour
is
the
isle
of
kishm
in
the
straits
of
ormuz
at
the
entrance
to
the
persian
gulf
will
ye
repate
that
tammas
iv
ye
plaze
i
briefly
rehearsed
such
relevant
information
as
i
possessed
whilst
rory
kidnapped
the
geographical
names
and
imprisoned
them
in

remarked
with
sincerity

by
the
way
if
there
anything
in

of
art
if
the
artist
soars
to
truth
by
the
path
which
no
fowl
knoweth
your
theory
may
find
some
support
in
the
fact
that
it
was
a
usage
of
the
renaissance
to
represent
the
skull
of
adam
at
the
foot
of
the
cross

whilst
replying
i
was
constrained
to
glance
round
at
the
weather
and
my
eye
happened
to
fall
on
the
pine
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
suddenly
a
strange
misgiving
seized
me
and
i
asked
involuntarily
do
you
have
many
swagmen
calling
round
here
nat
six
in
the
coorse
o
the
year
replied
rory
too
amiable
to
heed
the
impolite
change
of
subject
las
time
a
seen
ward
he
continued
after
a
moment
pause
he
toul
me
there
was
a
man
come
to
the
station
wan
mornin
airly
near
blin
wi
sandy
blight
an
he
stapped
all
day
in
a
dark
skillion
an
started
again
at
night
he
was
makin
fur
ivanhoe
fur
till

it
a
sore
ondhertakin
fur

at

this
is
nat
the
road
till
ivanhoe
my
word
rory
i
wish
either
you
or
i
had
spoken
of
this
when
you
came
home
last
night
never
mind
the
horses
now
give
me
your
bridle
and
take
mary
on
your
back
as
we
went
on
i
related
how
i
had
seen
the
man
reclining
under
the
tree
and
rory
nodded
forgivingly
when
i
explained
the
scruple
which
had
withheld
me
from
making
my
presence
known
he
must
come
there
afther
ten
yisterday
observed
rory
or
it
would
be
mighty
quare
fur
me
till
nat
see
him
consitherin
me
eyes
is
iverywhere
when
a
ridin
the
boundhry
but
he
was
near
the
boundary
i
had
turned
off
from
the
fence
to
see
that
dead
pine
with
the
big
creeper
on
it
which
pine
tammas
there
it
is
straight
ahead
the
biggest
of
the
three
that
you
see
above
the
scrub
you
notice
it
a
different
colour
ay
so
it
is
a
would
be
onaisy
tammas
it
likely
there
much
wrong
but
it
good
to
make
sartin
about
it
no
effort
could
shake
off
the
apprehension
which
grew
upon
me
as
we
neared
the
fence
but
on
reaching
it
i
said
briskly
stay
where
you
are
rory
i
be
back
in
half
a
minute
then
i
crushed
myself
through
the
wires
fifteen
or
twenty
paces
brought
me
to
the
spot
the
man
had
changed
his
position
and
was
now
lying
at
full
length
on
his
back
with
arms
extended
along
his
sides
his
face
was
fully
exposed
the
face
of
a
worker
in
the
prime
of
manhood
with
a
heavy
moustache
and
three
or
four
weeks
growth
of
beard
so
much
only
had
i
noted
at
first
glance
whilst
stooping
under
the
heavy
curtain
of
foliage
a
few
steps
more
and
looking
down
on
the
waxen
skin
of
that
inert
figure
i
instinctively
uncovered
my
head
the
dull
eyes
to
a
light
no
longer
intolerable
showed
by
their
tracery
of
inflamed
veins
how
much
the
lone
wanderer
had
suffered
the
hands
with
their
strong
bronze
now
paled
to
tarnished
ochre
were
heavily
callused
by
manual
labour
and
sharply
attenuated
by
recent
hardship
the
skin
was
cold
but
the
rigidity
of
death
was
yet
scarcely
apparent
evidently
he
had
not
died
of
thirst
alone
but
of
mere
physical
exhaustion
sealed
by
the
final
collapse
of
hope
and
it
seemed
so
strange
to
hear
the
low
voices
of
rory
and
mary
close
by
to
see
through
occasional
spaces
in
the
scrub
the
clear
expanse
of
the
horsepaddock
with
even
a
glimpse
of
the
house
all
homely
and
peaceful
in
the
silent
sunshine
but
such
is
life
and
such
is
death
rory
looked
earnestly
in
my
face
as
i
rejoined
him
and
breathed
one
of
his
customary
devotional
ejaculations
under
the
big
wilga
just
beyond
that
said
i
in
an
indifferent
tone
stay
with
me
mary
dear
i
continued
taking
out
my
i
make
you
a
picture
of
a
horse
but
a
aiger
fur
till
see
the
pine
wi
the
big
santipede
on
it
objected
the
terrible
infant
nat
now
darlin
replied
rory
sure
we
come
an
see
the
pine
when
we
lavin
o
time
but
we
in
a
hurry
now
stap
here
an
kape
misther
collins
company
daddy
be
back
at
wanst
he
kissed
the
child
and
disappeared
round
the
then
she
turned
her
unfathomable
eyes
reproachfully
on
my
face
as
i
sat
on
the
ground
a
love
you
tammas
becos
ye
spake
aisy
till
my
daddy
but
o
and
the
little
brown
fingers
wreathed
themselves
together
in
the
distress
of
her
soul
a
do
want
till
go
to
school
an
lave
my
daddy
his
lone
an
a
do
want
till
see
that
picther
iv
a
horse
an
a

me
daddy
i
weakly
explained
that
it
was
a
matter
of
no
great
importance
whether
she
went
to
school
or
not
and
that
at
worst
her
daddy
could
accompany
her
as
a
schoolmate

catastrophe
what
fatality
impelled
me
to
fix
on
the
above
all
other
days
in
the
month
why
did
i
glance
over
the
record
of
each
before
committing
myself
by
a
promise
to
review
and
annotate
the
entries
of
that
date
for

and
evil
as
the
days
of
the
years
of
my

have
undeniably
been
the
of

is
one
of
those
which
i
feel
least
satisfaction
in
recalling
moreover
i
incur
a
certain
risk
in
thus
unbosoming
myself
as
will
become
apparent
to
the
perfidious
reader
who
hungrily
shadows
me
through
this
compromising
story
but
it
may
be
graven
with
a
pen
of
iron
that
at
my
age

shirks
a

tells

i
answer
to
my
bail
one
reservation
i
must
make
however
for
reasons
which
will
too
soon
become
manifest
it
is
expedient
to
conceal
the
exact
locality
of
the
unhappy
experience
now
about
to
be
disclosed
but
i
think
i
shall
be
on
the
safe
side
in
setting
forth
that
it
was
somewhere
between
echuca
and
albury
any
person
who
happens
to
have
preserved
the
files
of
the
express
may
find
on
the
second
page
of
the
issue
of
the
following
local
intelligence
lunatic
at
large
on
the
night
of
friday
last
the
inhabitants
of
were
thrown
into
a
state
of
excitement
which
may
better
be
imagened
than
described
by
the
appearance
of
a
lunatic
in
puris
naturalibus
whose
mania
was
evidently
homicidal
during
the
earlier
portion
of
the
night
the
unfortunate
man
was
seen
from
time
to
time
by
quite
a
number
of
people
in
places
many
miles
apart
some
of
the
returning
from
the
picnic
held
by
the
sunday
school
teachers
noticed
elsewhere
in
our
columns
saw
him
scuttling
along
the
road
at
a
breakneck
pace
others
saw
him
dodging
behind
trees
or
endeavouring
to
conceal
himself
in
scrub
at
about
in
the
evening
one
of
the
picnic
party
an
athlete
of
some
repute
made
a
plucky
and
determined
attempt
to
capture
the
madman
and
succeeded
in
overpowering
him
this
accomplished
secundem
artem
an
impulse
of
humanity
prompted
k
for
as
some
of
our
readers
have
already
guessed
the
gentleman
referred
to
was
k
of
the
firm
of
d
and
s
drapers
to
divest
himself
of
part
of
his
own
clothing
for
the
benefit
of
his
prisoner
the
latter
when
k
attempted
to
force
the
clothing
upon
him
rent
the
air
with
horrible
shrieks
heard
by
many
others
of
the
party
and
by
exertion
of
the
unnatural
strength
which
insanity
confers
broke
from
his
captor
and
escaped
k
humorously
comments
on
the
difficulty
of
holding
a
nude
antagonist
if
we
were
inclined
to
be
facetious
on
the
subject
we
might
suggest
that
mens
sana
in
corpore
sano
is
not
an
infallible
rule
late
in
the
evening
the
maniac
horresco
referrens
made
a
furious
attack
on
the
residence
of
g
who
was
unfortunately
absent
at
the
time
g
with
the
splendid
courage
which
distinguishes
the
farmer
wife
kept
him
at
bay
till
some
wild
impulse
drove
him
to
seek
fresh
fields
and
pastures
new
the
black
trackers
who
were
brought
on
the
scene
on
saturday
afternoon
have
found
his
tracks
in
a
flower
garden
close
to
the
parlour
window
and
also
around
h
homestead
the
trackers
aver
that
he
is
accorpanied
by
a
large
kaugaroo
dog
it
is
a
matter
of
congratulation
that
he
has
so
far
failed
in
effecting
an
entrance
to
any
habitation
the
police
are
scouring
the
neighbourhood
and
though
the
thunderstorm
of
saturday
night
has
unfortunately
placed
the
trackers
at
fault
we
trust
soon
to
chronicle
a
clever
capture
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wished
various
surmises
are
afloat
regarding
the
identity
of
the
lunatic
but
to
our
mind
the
suggestion
of
inspector
collins
of
the
civil
service
appears
most
tenable
on
saturday
afternoon
when
the
excitement
was
at
its
height
this
gentleman
called
at
our
office
and
in
course
of
conversation
on
the
topic
pronounced
his
opinion
that
the
lunatic
is
no
other
than
the
late
escapee
from
beechworth
asylum
anent
his
mysterious
disapearance
at
some
time
late
on
friday
night
collins
supposes
that
he
must
have
drowned
himself
in
the
river
and
advances
many
ingenious
and
apparently
conclusive
arguments
in
support
of
both
his
hypotheses
notwithstanding
the
ingenuity
and
conclusiveness
of
those
arguments
the
chain
of
fatalities
which
has
headed
this
story
with
the
entry
of
brings
the
reluctant
secret
to
light
i
was
that
homicidal
maniac
the
second
page
of
the
newspaper
just
quoted
will
be
also
found
to
contain
in
another
column
the
following
local
item
we
regret
to
learn
that
on
the
morning
of
saturday
last
q
lost
a
valuable
stack
of
hay
by
fire
the
conflagation
was
detected
almost
immediately
on
its
breaking
out
but
no
steps
could
be
taken
to
check
the
progress
of
the
devouring
element
it
might
be
reasonably
expected
that
q
popularity
would
be
a
sufficient
safeguard
against
such
barbarous
incendiarism
but
of
a
truth
there
are
people
now
at
large
who
ought
to
be
in
durance
vile
at
the
moment
of
our
going
to
press
we
are
happy
to
add
that
the
police
have
a
clue
and
will
soon
no
doubt
unearth
the
cowardly
perpetrator
of
this
outrage
and
drag
him
forth
to
condign
punishment
however
the
perpetrator
in
question
being
even
more
cunning
than
cowardly
took
special
order
that
the
police
should
not
unearth
him
and
here
he
sits
in
his
temporary
sanctum
inviting
them
to
come
on
with
what
is
left
of
their
clue
though
at
the
same
time
keeping
like
sir
andrew
o
the
windy
side
o
the
law
by
putting
initials
and
dashes
in
place
of
full
names
and
by
leaving
the
exact
locality
unspecified
drag
me
forth
to
condign
punishment
my
word
drag
a
barrister
now
for
my
narrative
charley
v
a
boundary
rider
on
b
station
is
one
of
my
very
oldest
acquaintances
away
back
in
the
procuratorship
of
latrobe
two
angels
in
wreaths
of
asphodel
had
almost
simultaneously
deposited
charley
and
myself
on
the
same
station
respectively
in
the
hut
of
a
and
in
the
hut
of
a
petty
overseer
together
as
the
seasons
passed
we
had
looked
forward
to
the
shearing
the
and
the
lambing
and
together
we
had
watched
the
lagoon
for
the
bunyip
we
had
aimed
our
little
at
the
same
mark
we
had
whirled
our
little
boomerangs
over
the
same
big
tree
and
we
had
been
welted
an
equal
number
of
times
for
crossing
the
river
on
the
same
slippery
log
whatever
may
be
the
development
of
my
own
inner
nature
charley
at
least
walks
faithfully
in
the
moral
twilight
which
his
early
training
vouchsafed
to
him
his
fidelity
to
b
station
is
like
that
which
ought
to
distinguish
somebody
wife
i
forget
whose
but
no
matter
the
mere
ownership
of
the
property
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
charley
when
the
place
changes
hands
he
is
valued
and
sold
as
part
of
the
working
plant
without
his
concern
and
almost
without
his
knowledge
owners
may
come
and
owners
may
go
but
he
virtually
goes
on
for
ever
his
little
hut
three
or
four
miles
north
from
the
murray
is
the
very
headquarters
of
hospitality
he
has
some
hundreds
of
pounds
lent
out
without
interest
or
security
though
his
pay
is
only
fifteen
shillings
a
week
with
ten
ten
two
and
a
quarter
and
he
is
anything
but
a
miser
many
people
would
like
a
leaf
out
of
his
book
it
is
my
privilege
to
be
able
to
furnish
this
though
in
a
sort
of
ambiguous
way
having
received
the
information
in
confidence
here
it
is
in
a
bend
on
the
north
bank
of
the
murray
a
few
miles
from
charley
hut
is
a
tract
about
a
hundred
acres
in
extent
of
fine
grass
land
completely
isolated
by
billabongs
dense
scrub
and
steep
ridges
of
loose
sand
at
the
time
i
write
of
it
was
impossible
to
ride
to
this
island
of
verdure
and
no
white
man
could
track
a
horse
through
the
labyrinth
that
led
to
it
once
placed
in
that
spot
no
horse
would
ever
try
to
get
away
this
is
all
the
information
i
feel
justified
in
giving
during
the
afternoon
of
the
i
was
sitting
on
a
log
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
on
the
north
bank
of
the
river
about
a
mile
from
that
secluded
eden
and
four
or
five
from
charley
hut
i
had
camped
at
dusk
on
the
previous
evening
and
the
equipment
of
my
two
horses
with
other
impedimenta
was
lying
about
a
small
damper
was
maturing
under
the
handful
of
fire
and
a
quart
pot
of
tea
was
slowly
collecting
a
scum
of
dirt
which
made
it
nothing
the
worse
to
a
man
of
my
nurture
pup
was
reposing
on
my
possum
rug
and
cleopatra
and
bunyip
were
in
eden
per
favour
of
the
kindly
scoundrel
who
held
that
property
by
right
of
discovery
and
who
in
spite
of
some
reluctance
on
my
part
had
made
me
free
of
it
along
with
my
two
horses
were
ten
or
twelve
others
all
strangers
and
in
various
stages
of
ripening
for
rewards
owing
to
the
broken
character
of
the
country
the
lay
three
or
four
miles
north
of
charley
very
private
property
but
a
short
cut
impassable
during
the
winter
and
impracticable
at
any
time
to
wheeled
vehicles
saved
about
three
miles
in
ten
and
passed
within
a
mile
of
the
property
it
was
beside
this
pad
that
i
was
camped
the
refined
leisure
of
the
day
had
been
devoted
chiefly
to
the
study
of
my
current
edwards
on
redemption
and
now
by
the
laborious
blasphemy
of
the
work
i
was
seeking
deliverance
from
the
sin
of
reading
it
by
watching
the
multitudes
of
white
cockatoos
through
my
binocular
and
piously
speculating
as
to
their
intended
use
presently
sweeping
the
with
the
glass
i
noticed
crossing
an
open
place
about
a
mile
away
the
figure
of
a
swagman
approaching
from
the
west
that
is
coming
up
the
river
i
kept
the
glass
in
his
direction
and
whenever
he
disappeared
i
was
on
the
watch
and
caught
him
again
as
he
came
in
sight
tramping
wearily
along
in
the
roasting
sun
that
swagman
had
a
history
highly
important
at
all
events
to
himself
he
had
been
born
he
lived
he
would
probably
die
and
if
any
human
being
wants
a
higher
record
than
that
he
must
work
for
it
this
man
personal
value
judged
by
the
standard
which
i
for
one
dare
not
disown
was
certainly
as
high
as
that
of
the
average
monarch
or
but
was
i
as
much
interested
as
i
would
have
been
had
one
of
these
personages
been
approaching
my
camp
in
state
and
if
not
why
not
i
immediately
filled
and
lit
a
mighty
german
meerschaum
an
ally
of
established
efficiency
in
ethical
emergencies
such
as
this
then
laying
the
pipe
so
to
speak
on
the
scent
of
the
swagman
i
attempted
a
clairvoyant
along
his
past
history
and
essayed
a
forecast
of
his
future
destiny
in
order
to
get
at
the
valuation
presumably
placed
upon
him
by
his
maker
but
the
pipe
being
now
master
of
the
position
gently
seduced
my
mind
to
a
wider
consideration
merely
using
the
swagman
as
a
convenient
for
its
flight
into
regions
of
the
larger
morality
this
is
its
hobby
caught
probably
from
some
society
of
german
illuminati
where
it
became
a
kind
of
or
accumulator
of
such
truths
as
ministers
of
the
gospel
can
not
afford
to
preach
ah
moralised
the
pipe
the
man
who
spends
his
life
in
actual
hardship
seldom
causes
a
trumpet
to
be
blown
before
him
he
is
generally
by
heredity
or
by
the
dispensation
of
providence
an
ornament
to
the
lower
walks
of
life
therefore
his
plea
genuine
if
ungrammatical
is
heard
only
at
in
a
fragmentary
and
garbled
form
little
wonder
then
that
such
a
plea
is
received
with
felicitous
or
passed
with
pharisaical
disregard
by
the
silly
old
world
that
has
still
so
many
lessons
to
learn
so
many
lessons
which
none
but
that
unresisting
butt
of
jokers
can
fitly
teach
and
which
he
the
experienced
one
is
usually
precluded
from
teaching
by
his
inability
to
spell
any
word
of
two
syllables
yet
he
has
thoughts
that
glow
and
words
that
burn
albeit
with
such
sulphurous
fumes
that
when
uttered
in
a
public
place
they
frequently
render
him
liable
to
fourteen
days
without
the
option
and
even
though
he
be
not
a
poor
rogue
hereditary
even
though
he
may
once
have
tasted
the
comfort
ambiguously
scorned
of
devils
even
though
his
descent
into
avernus
be
like
that
of
ulysses
or
dante
temporary
and
incidental
you
need
expect
him
on
reaching
the
upper
air
to
be
the
prophet
spokesman
and
champion
of
the
order
whose
bitter
he
has
eaten
you
must
be
surprised
to
find
him
reticent
not
to
say
mendacious
respecting
details
which
he
may
regard
as
humiliating
a
sort
of
irish
pride
will
probably
lead
him
to
represent
that
he
had
abundant
though
unavailable
resources
during
the
period
of
his
perdition
for
one
or
the
other
of
these
reasons
orthographical
inability
or
irish
pride
the
half
is
never
told
therefore
as
a
rule
the
reading
public
is
acquainted
only
with
sketchy
and
fallacious
pictures
of
that
continuous
indurating
hardship
which
finally
sends
reluctant
hope
after
her
of
the
box
and
further
of
this
my
son
be
admonished
continued
the
pipe
the
more
bitter
the
hardship
the
more
unmixed
and
cordial
is
the
ignominy
lavished
by
the
elect
upon
the
sufferer
always
provided
the
latter
is
one
of
the
and
more
particularly
if
he
is
a
swagman
yet
this
futureless
person
is
the
man
who
pioneers
all
industries
who
discovers
and
unearths
the
precious
ores
whose
heavy
footprints
mark
the
waterless
mulga
the
plains
and
the
scorching
sand
who
leaves
intaglio
impressions
of
his
mortal
coil
on
the
wet
ground
at
every
camp
from
the
murray
to
the
gulf
and
whose
only
satisfaction
in
the
cold
which
curls
him
up

blasphemously
evading

that

the
the
only
god
we

is
by
his
own

by
the

of
the

whosoever

to
recognise
in
the

visage
of
any
social
derelict
the
image
of
him
who
was
despised
and
rejected
of
men
whosoever
resents
not
the
spectacle
of
that
image
weighted
down
by
fraternal
neglect
and
oppression
till
a
human
heart
pulses
with
no
higher
aspiration
than
that
which
prompts
a
persecuted
animal
to
preserve
its

for
further
persecution
such
a
person
i
say
can
have
no

among
the

workmen
being
already
employed
on
the
ageless
this
special
study
of
hardship
resumed
the
pipe
after
a
pause
leads
naturally
to
the
generic
study
of
poverty
for
as
the
greater
includes
the
less
poverty
includes
hardship
along
with
disfranchisement
social
outlawry
proud
man
contumely
and
so
forth
entirely
without
reference
to
the
moral
worth
of
the
person
most
concerned
in
a
word
poverty
is
in
the
eyes
of
the
orthodox
christian
a
hell
in
the
hand
better
worth
avoiding
than
two
hells
in
the
book
which
latter
may
be
only
figurative
after
all
but
the
great
institution
of
poverty
ruminated
the
pipe
is
too
often
referred
to
in
this
large
loose
way
there
are
two
kinds
or
rather
the
condition
exhibits
two
opposite
extremes
of
moral
quality
there
is
a
voluntary
poverty
which
is
certainly
the
least
base
situation
you
can
occupy
whilst
you
crawl
between
heaven
and
earth
and
which
is
not
so
rare
as
your
sordid
disposition
might
lead
you
to
imagine
there
is
also
a
compulsory
poverty
shading
down
from
discontented
to
contented
and
paradoxical
as
it
may
appear
the
contented
is
the
opposing
pole
to
voluntary
poverty
the
discontented
is
the
perpetual
troubler
of
the
world
by
reason
of
its
aiming
only
at
changing
the
incidence
of
hardship
and
succeeding
fairly
well
in
its
object
touching
the
contented
well
possibly
the
hindoo
language
might
do
justice
to
its
vileness
the
english
falls
entirely
short
poverty
is
utterly
irredeemably
despicable
and
by
necessity
ignorantly
blasphemous
not
because
its
style
of
glorifying
god
is
to
place
his
conceded
image
exactly
at
the
level
but
because
it
teaches
its
babies
from
the
cradle
upward
that
a
capricious
has
made
for
them
and
something
with
a
french
name
for
its
boy
moleskins
tied
below
the
knee
for
them
and
a
belltopper
for
the
favourite
of
the
family
the
three
r
for
them
and
the
classics
ancient
and
modern
for
the

chosen
to
honour

snakejuice
for
them
and

for
the
other

the
adherents
of
this
cult
vote
conservative
work
scab
and
are
rightly
termed
the
deserving
poor
inasmuch
as
they
richly
deserve
every
degree
of
poverty
every
ounce
of
indignity
and
every
inch
of
condescension
they
stagger
under
but
their
children
do
deserve
these
things
and
just
mark
the
slimy
little
which
in
order
to
keep
the
deserving
poor
up
to
their
work
pronounces
upon
them
the
blessings
obviously
adherent
only
to
that
unquestionable
guarantee
of
unselfish
purpose
namely
voluntary
poverty
a
subtle
confusion
of
issues
but
the
person
who
homilises
on
the
blessings
of
compulsory
poverty
should
be
left
talking
to
the
undefileable
atmosphere
yet
do
i
cling
continued
the
pipe
to
plato
beautiful
thought
that
no
soul
misses
truth
willingly
in
bare
justice
to
brave
misguided
humanity
in
daily
touch
with
beings
in
so
many
respects
little
lower
than
the
imagined
angels
in
dispassionate
survey
of
history
lurid
record
of
distorted
loyalty
staining
our
old
sad
earth
with
of
opposing
loyalty
while
each
side
fights
for
an
idea
in
view
of
the
zeal
which
fires
the
to
endure
all
that
equal
zeal
can
inflict
in
contemplation
of
the
enmity
between
the
seed
of
the
woman
and
the
seed
of
the
serpent
the
ormuzd
and
the
ahriman
in
man
in
view
even
of
that
dismal
experiment
indifferently
termed
making
the
best
of
both
worlds
and
serving
god
and
mammon
in
view
of
all
these
things
i
can
not
think
it
is
anything
worse
than
a
and
curable
ignorance
which
makes
men
eager
to
subvert
a
human
equality
as
human
variety
and
impregnable
as
any
mathematical
axiom
and
this
special
brand
of
ignorance
is
even
more
rampant
amongst
those
educated
asses
who
can
read
kikero

than
amongst

who
know
not

pursued
the

with
a
touch
of
severity
that

apprehends
no
decimal
of
a
second
adequate
to
note
on
the
limitless
circle
of
time
the
briefness
of
a
centenarian
life
and
yet
the
giddiest
pitch
of
human
effrontery
dares
not
carry
beyond
the
incident
of
death
any
vestige
of
a
social
code
now
accepted
as

enough
to
initiate
a
development
which
according
to
your
own
showing
goes
on
through
changing

till
some
transcendent
purpose
is
fulfilled
the
love
of

that

falsest
of
equivocations

the
inflated

one
of
his

the
church
quibbles
well
and
palters
well
and
in
her
own
pusillanimous
way
means
well
by
her
silky
loyalty
to
the
law
and
the
profits
and
by
her
steady
hostility
to
some
unresisting
personification
known
as
the
common
enemy
but
because
of
that
pernicious
loyalty
she
has
reason
to
complain
that
the
working
man
is
too
rational
to
imbibe
her
teachings
on
the
blessedness
of
slavery
and
starvation
meanwhile
as
no
magnanimous
sinner
can
live
down
to
the
standard
unprogressive
agnosticism
takes
the
place
of
demoralised
belief
and
the
kingdom
of
god
fades
into
a
myth
yet
there
is
nothing
utopian
pleaded
the
pipe
in
the
charter
of
that
kingdom
in
the
sunshiny
sermon
on
the
mount
it
is
no
fanciful
conception
of
an
intangible
order
of
things
but
a
practical
workable
code
of
daily
life
adapted
to
any
stage
of
civilisation
and
delivered
to
men
and
women
who
even
according
to
the
showing
of
hopeless
pessimists
or
strenuous
advocates
for
individualistic
force
and
cunning
were
in
all
respects
like
ourselves
delivered
moreover
by
one
who
knew
exactly
the
potentialities
and
aspirations
of
man
and
in
the
unerring
harmony
of
the
original
idea
the
outcome
of
that
inimitable
teaching
is
merely
the
consummation
of
prophetic
forecast
in
earlier
ages
first
the
slenderest
crescent
seen
by
eyes
that
diligently
searched
the
sky
then
a
broader
crescent
a
hemisphere
at
last
a
perfect
sphere
discovered
by
the
nazarene
artisan
and
by
him
made
plain
to
all
who
wish
to
see
but
from
the
dawn
of
the
ages
that
orb
was
there
waiting
for
recognition
waiting
with
the
awful
tireless
patience
for
which
no
better
name
has
been
found
than
the
will
of
god
history
marks
a
point
of
time
when
first
the
humanity
of
god
touched
the
divine
aspiration
in
man
fulfilling
under
the
skies
of
palestine
the
dim
yet
infallible
instinct
of
every
race
from
eastern
mongol
to
western
aztec
the
soul
naturally
christian
responds
to
this
touch
even
though
blindly
and
erratically
and
so
from
generation
to
generation
the
multitudes
stand
waiting
to
welcome
the
gospel
of
humanity
with
palms
and
hosannas
as
of
old
while
from
generation
to
generation
phylactered
exclusiveness
takes
counsel
against
the
revolution
which
is
to
make
all
things
new
and
shall
this
opposition
the
opposition
by
slander
conspiracy
bribery
and
force
prevail
till
the
fatal
line
is
once
more
passed
and
you
await
the
titus
sword
to
drown
your
land
in
blood
and
the

your

the

after
a
pause
i

undreamt
of

in

now
a
revolt
of
enlightenment
against
ignorance

the
domination
of
the
manifestly
unworthy

answering

the
of

the

hideous
beyond

the
degradation
of
the

i

the
cycle
of
loyalty
to
error
draws
near
its
close
for
the
whole
armoury
of
the
father
of
lies
can
furnish
no

to
turn
aside
the
point
of
the
tireless
and
terrible
pen

which
in
these
latter
days
scornfully
touches
the
demon
of
privilege
and
discloses
a
swelling
frog
contemporaneous
literature
continued
the
pipe
thoughtfully
is
our
surest
register
of
advance
or
retrogression
and
with
few
exceptions
indeed
the
prevailing
and
conspicuous
element
in
all
publications
of
more
than
a
century
ago
is
a
tacit
acceptance
of
irresponsible
lordship
and
abject
inferiority
as
divine
ordinances
brutal
indifference
utter
contempt
or
more
insulting
condescension
toward
the
rank

english
gentleman
religion
a
point
of
our
faith
as
the
pious
sir
thomas
browne
seriously
puts
it
the
complementary
part
being
a
loathsome
servility
toward
nobility
and
royalty
in
that
era
the
most
amiable
of
english
poets
felt
constrained
to
weave
into
his
exquisite
elegy
an
undulating
thread
of
modest
apology
for
bringing
under
notice
the
short
and
simple
annals
of
the
vaisya
caste
later
cowper
thought
poverty
humility
industry
and
piety
a
beautiful
combination
for
the
wearer
of
the
smock
frock
even
crabbe
blindly
accepted
the
sanctified
lie
of
social
inequality
and
this
assumption
was
religiously
acquiesced
in
by
the
lower
animal
himself
who
doubtless
glorified
god
for
the
distinctly
unsearchable
wisdom
and
manifested
in
those
workhouse
regulations
which
separated
his
own
age
from
the
equal
feebleness
of
the
wife
whose
human
rights
he
should
have
died
fighting
for
when
he
was
young
and
as
might
be
expected
this
strictly
gentlemanly
principle
looms
larger
in
your
forefathers
prose
than
in
their
poetry
at
last
burns
and
paine
flashed
their
own
strong
healthy
personalities
on
the
community
marking
an
epoch
and
from
that
day
to
this
the
apology
of
humanity
acquires
momentum
and
scope
now
if
conditions
fail
to
keep
abreast
with
the
impetuous
uncontrollable
advance
of
popular
intelligence
the
time
must
come
when
with
one
the
latter
shall
assail
the
former
and
the
scene
of
this
unpleasantness
concluded
the
infatuated
pipe
is
called
in
the
hebrew
tongue
armageddon
the
swagman
approached
plodding
steadily
along
with
his
billy
in
one
hand
and
his
in
the
other
on
his
shoulder
fashion
his
forty
years
gathering
and
in
his
patient
face
his
forty
years
history
clearly
legible
to
me
by
reason
of
a
gift
which
i
happily
possess
i
was
roused
from
my
reverie
by
some
one
saying
how
fares
our
cousin
hamlet
come
and
have
a
drink
of
tea
and
beggar
the
expense
good
day
responded
hamlet
still
pursuing
his
journey
come
on
come
on
why
should
the
spirit
of
mortal
be
proud
eh
and
he
stopped
and
faced
about
come
and
have
a
feed
i
shouted
i
do
that
ready
enough
said
he
laying
his
fardel
down
in
the
shade
and
seating
himself
on
it
with
a
satisfied
sigh
i
rooted
my
damper
out
of
its
matrix
flogged
the
ashes
off
it
with
a
and
placed
it
before
my
guest
together
with
a
large
wedge
of
leathery
cheese
a
and
the
quart
pot
and
pannikin
eat
and
good
dich
thy
good
heart
apemantus
said
i
cordially
then
resuming
my
seat
i
took
leisure
to
observe
him
he
was
an
everyday
sight
but
one
which
never
loses
its
interest
to
me
the
bent
and
haggard
wreck
of
what
should
have
been
a
fine
soldierly
man
the
honest
face
sunken
and
furrowed
the
neglected
hair
and
matted
beard
thickly
strewn
with
grey
his
eyes
revealed
another
victim
to
the
scourge
of
ophthalmia
this
malady
by
the
way
must
not
be
confounded
with
sandy
blight
the
latter
is
acute
the
former
chronic
coming
from
moama
i
conjectured
at
length
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
ai
had
anything
since
yesterday
afternoon
course
you
go
short
when
you
travellin
but
i
a
man
that
like
to
be
makin
a
song
about
it
would
you
stand
a
better
show
for
work
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
eh
is
the
vic
side
the
best
for
work
i
shouted
yes
takin
it
generally
but
there
a
new
startin
on
this
side
seven
or
eight
mile
up
from
here
an
i
know
the
two
fellers
that
owns
it
two
brothers
the
name
o
h
fact
i
got
my
eyes
cooked
at
a
thresher
for
them
i
not
frightened
but
what
i
git
work
at
the
mill
fine
reasonable
fellers
would
it
suit
you
better
to
look
out
for
some
steady
work
on
a
farm
very
carm
sort
o
carm
heat
i
think
there
a
thunderstorm
hangin
about
we
have
rain
before
this
moon
goes
out
for
a
certainty
she
come
in
on
her
back
i
dunno
whether
you
noticed
i
did
notice
do
you
find
this
kind
of
weather
making
your
eyes
worse
my
word
you
right
not
much
chance
of
a
man
makin
a
rise
the
way
things
is
now
dunno
what
the
country
comin
to
i
do
blame
people
for
not
givin
work
when
they
got
no
work
to
give
but
they
might
be
civil
he
paused
and
went
on
with
his
repast
in
silence
for
a
minute
it
required
no
great
prescience
to
read
his
thought
man
must
be
subject
to
sale
by
auction
or
be
a
wearer
of
imperial
uniform
before
the
susceptibility
to
insult
perishes
in
his
soul
i
been
carryin
a
swag
close
on
twenty
year
he
resumed
but
i
never
got
sich
a
divil
of
a
blaggardin
as
i
got
this
mornin
course
i
wrong
to
swear
about
it
but
that
a
thing
i
ai
in
the
habit
o
doin
it
was
at
a
place
eight
or
ten
mile
down
the
river
on
the
vic
side
i
was
cadging
nyther
i
jist
merely
ast
for
work
not
havin
heard
about
the
h
s
till
after
an
i
thought
the
bloke
was
goin
to
jump
down
my
throat
i
did
ketch
the
most
o
what
he
said
but
i
foun
him
givin
me
rats
for
campin
about
as
fur
off
of
his
place
as
from
here
to
the
other
side
o
the
river
an
a
lagoon
betwixt
an
not
a
particle
o
grass
for
the
fire
to
run
on
fact
i
a
man
that
careful
about
fire
mind
you
i
did
set
fire
to
a
bit
of
a
dead
log
on
the
reserve
but
a
man
has
to
get
a
whiff
o
smoke
these
nights
on
account
o
the
muskeeters
an
there
was
no
more
danger
nor
there
is
with
this
fire
o
yours
called
me
everything
but
a
gentleman
possess
your
soul
in
patience
you
have
no
remedy
and
no
appeal
till
we
gather
at
the
river
o
i
was
in
luck
there
jist
after
i
heard
about
this
bein
then
on
the
vic
side
i
foun
a
couple
o
swells
goin
to
a
picnic
in
a
boat
an
i
told
them
i
wanted
to
git
across
an
they
carted
me
over
an
no
compliment
difference
in
people
i
know
the
h
s
i
shouted
when
did
you
hear
about
them
starting
this
o
this
forenoon
i
must
ast
you
to
speak
loud
i
got
the
misfortune
to
be
a
bit
hard
o
hearin
most
people
notices
it
on
me
but
i
was
you
did
remark
it
it
come
through
a
cold
i
got
in
the
head
about
six
year
ago
among
the
bungaree
savages
i
sorry
for
you
well
it
was
this
way
after
the
feller
hunted
me
off
of
his
place
this
mornin
who
should
i
meet
but
a
young
chap
an
his
girl
goin
to
this
picnic
with
a
white
horse
in
the
buggy
now
that
one
o
these
civil
sort
o
chaps
you
sometimes
git
among
the
farmers
name
o
archie
m
i
dunno
whether
you
might
know
him
he
superintender
o
the
e
sunday
school
fact
i
bin
with
the
h
thresher
at
his
ole
man
place
four
years
runnin
so
when
he
seen
me
this
mornin
it
was
andy
lookin
for
work
an
the
next
word
was
i
sorry
we
ai
got
no
work
for
you
or
words
to
that
effect
says
he
the
h
s
a
fifteen
or
twenty
mile
up
the
river
on
the
other
side
they
wo
see
you
beat
says
he
if
you
do
git
on
with
them
says
he
straight
back
to
our
place
an
we
see
about
something
says
he
so
i
makin
my
way
to
the
well
i
hope
you
get
on
there
mate
you
right
it
half
the
battle
wust
of
it
is
you
ca
stick
to
a
mate
when
you
got
him
i
was
workin
mates
with
a
raw
feller
las
winter
ringin
on
the
yanko
grand
feller
he
was
name
o
tom
but
as
it
happened
we
was
workin
for
a
feller
name
o
joe
collins
an
we
was
on
for
savin
so
we
drawed
an
beggar
me
if
this
joe
collins
did
git
paid
up
on
the
sly
an
travelled
so
we
fell
in
ca
be
too
careful
when
you
workin
for
a
workin
man
but
i
would
like
to
be
in
joe
collins
boots
when
tom
ketches
him
scotch
chap
tom
is
well
after
bin
had
like
this
we
went
out
on
the
lachlan
clean
an
tom
got
a
job
boundary
ridin
through
another
feller
goin
to
mount
brown
diggin
an
there
was
no
work
for
me
so
we
had
to
shake
hands
i
part
my
last
sprat
to
that
feller
i
believe
you
would
but
i
thinking
of
joe
collins
to
a
student
of
nominology
this
is
a
most
unhappy
combination
joseph
denotes
sneaking
hypocrisy
whilst
collins
is
a
guarantee
of
probity
fancy
the
broad
arrow
and
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honour
woven
into
a
monogram
rakin
style
o
dog
you
got
there
i
dunno
when
i
seen
the
like
of
him
well
i
think
i
be
pushin
on
i
got
a
sort
o
rough
idear
where
this
mill
is
an
there
ai
many
people
this
side
o
the
river
to
inquire
off
of
an
my
eyes
is
none
o
the
best
i
be
you
good
day
are
you
a
smoker
i
asked
replenishing
my
own
sagacious
meerschaum
because
you
might
try
a
plug
of
this
tobacco
now
that
man
deafness
was
genuine
and
i
spoke
in
my
ordinary
tone
yet
the
magic
word
vibrated
accurately
and
unmistakably
on
the
paralysed
tympanum
let
your
scientists
account
for
that
if
you
can
spare
it
replied
the
swagman
with
animation
smokin
about
the
pleasure
a
man
got
in
this
world
an
i
jist
used
up
the
dust
out
o
my
pockets
this
mornin
so
this
go
high
my
word
well
good
day
i
might
be
able
to
do
the
same
for
you
some
time
thou
speakest
wiser
than
thou
art
of
i
soliloquised
as
i
watched
his
retreating
figure
whilst
lighting
my
pipe
as
the
other
philosopher
tycho
brahe
found
inspiration
in
the
gibberish
of
his
idiot
companion
so
do
i
find
food
for
reflection
in
thy
casual
courtesy
my
friend
possibly
i
have
reached
the
highest
point
of
all
my
greatness
and
from
that
full
meridian
of
my
glory
i
haste
now
to
my
setting
from
a
with
the
mortuary
reversion
of
the
itself
to
a
swagman
bluey
on
shoulder
and
billy
in
hand
is
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
playful
moke
such
is
life
the
longer
i
smoked
the
more
charmed
i
was
with
the
rounded
symmetry
and
steady
lustre
of
that
pearl
of
truth
which
the
swagman
had
brought
forth
out
of
his
treasury
for
philosophy
is
no
warrant
against
destitution
as
biography
amply
vouches
neither
is
tireless
industry
nor
mechanical
skill
nor
artistic
culture
if
unaccompanied
by
that
business
aptitude
which
tends
to
the
survival
of
the
shrewdest
and
not
even
then
if
a
person
mana
is
off
neither
is
the
saintliest
piety
any
safeguard
if
the
author
of
the
psalm
lived
at
the
present
time
he
would
see
the
righteous
well
represented
among
the
unemployed
and
his
seed
in
the
industrial
schools
for
correction
of
the
misleading
experience
one
need
go
no
further
down
the
very
restricted
stream
of
sacred
history
than
the
date
of
the
typical
lazarus
continually
impending
calamities
menace
with
utter
destitution
any
given
man
though
he
may
bury
his
foolish
head
in
the
sand
and
think
himself
safe
there
lives
no
one
on
earth
to
day
who
holds
even
the
flimsiest
gossamer
of
security
against
a
pauper
death
and
a
pauper
grave
if
he
be
as
rich
as
croesus
let
him
remember
solon
warning
with
its
fulfilment
and
the
change
since
has
by
no
means
been
in
the
direction
of
fixity
of
tenure
where
are
of
the
fortunes
of
twenty
years
ago
and
where
will
the
other
half
be
in
twenty
years
more
though
i
am
like
sir
john
old
only
in
judgment
and
understanding
i
have
again
and
again
seen
the
wealthy
emir
of
yesterday
sitting
on
the
scraping
himself
with
a
bit
of
crockery
but
happily
too
broken
to
find
an
inhuman
sneer
for
the
vagrants
whom
in
former
days
he
would
have
disdained
to
set
with
the
dogs
of
his
flock
i
could
write
you
a
column
of
these
emirs
names
and
if
there
is
one
impudent
interpolation
in
the
bible
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
last
chapter
of
that
ancient
book
of
job
the
original
writer
conceived
a
tragedy
anticipating
the
grandeur
of
the
oedipus
at
colonos
or
lear
and
here
eight
supplementary
verses
have
this
masterpiece
to
the
level
of
a
boys
novel
also
the
lord
gave
job
twice
as
much
as
he
had
before
job
human
nature
had
sustained
a
laceration
that
nothing
but
death
could
heal
is
there
any
rich
man
who
can
not
imagine
a
combination
of
circumstances
that
would
have
given
him
lodgings
under
the
bridge
that
may
still
do
so
say
within
twelve
months
setting
my
knighthood
and
my
soldiership
aside
i
can
imagine
a
combination
that
would
have
quartered
me
in
that
airy
colonnade
nay
that
may
do
so
before
this
day
week
and
my
view
of
the
matter
is
that
if
i
become
not
the
bridge
as
well
as
another
a
plague
of
my
bringing
up
we
are
all
walking
along
the
shelving
edge
of
a
precipice
any
one
of
us
may
go
at
any
moment
or
be
dragged
down
by
another
and
this
is
as
it
ought
to
be
justice
is
done
and
the
sky
does
not
fall
for
from
a
higher
point
of
view
the
sabians
and
chaldeans
of
the
present
day
do
dislocate
society
they
only
alter
the
incidence
of
existing
dislocation
and
all
this
works
steadily
towards
a
restoration
if
not
of
some
old
saturnian
or
jahvistic
at
least
of
a
divine
intention
and
human
ideal
vicissitude
of
fortune
is
the
very
hand
of
the
eternal
not
ourselves
that
maketh
for
righteousness
the
manifestation
of
the
power
behind
moral
evolution
and
we
may
safely
trust
the
harmony
of
universal
legislation
for
this
antidote
to
a
grievous
disease
we
may
rest
confident
that
whilst
this
best
of
all
possible
worlds
remains
under
the
worst
of
all
possible
managements
the
solemn
threat
of
centuries
ago
shall
not
lack
fulfilment
the
poor
shall
never
cease
out
of
the
land
and
no
man
knows
when
his
own
turn
may
come
but
all
this
is
strictly
conditional
collective
humanity
holds
the
key
to
that
kingdom
of
god
on
earth
which
prophets
of
all
ages
have
pictured
in
colours
that
never
fade
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
us
our
duty
is
to
give
it
form
and
effect
a
local
habitation
and
a
name
in
the
meantime
our
reluctance
to
submit
to
the
terms
of
citizenship
has
no
more
effect
on
the
iron
law
of
citizen
reciprocity
than
our
disapproval
has
on
the
process
of
the
seasons
for
see
how
in
the
great
human
family
the
innocent
suffer
for
the
guilty
and
not
only
are
the
sins
of
the
fathers
visited
upon
the
children
but
my
sins
are
visited
upon
your
children
and
your
sins
upon
some
one
else
children
so
that
if
we
decline
a
brotherhood
of
mutual
blessing
and
honour
we
alternatively
accept
one
of
mutual
injury
and
ignominy
eternal
justice
is
in
no
hurry
for
recognition
but
flesh
and
blood
will
assuredly
tire
before
that
principle
tires
it
is
precisely
in
relation
to
the
palingenesis
of
humanity
that
to
the
unseen
will
one
day
is
said
to
be
as
a
thousand
years
and
a
thousand
years
as
one
day
a
divine
idea
points
the
way
clearly
apparent
to
any
vision
not
warped
by
interest
or
prejudice
nor
darkened
by
ignorance
but
the
work
is
man
alone
and
its
period
rests
with
man
my
reason
for
indulging
in
this
reverie
was
merely
to
banish
the
thought
of
my
late
guest
of
course
my
object
in
recording
it
here
is
simply
to
kill
time
for
to
speak
like
a
true
man
i
linger
shivering
on
the
brink
of
the
disclosures
to
which
i
am
pledged
i
feel
something
like
the
doomed
nero
when
he
stood
holding
the
dagger
near
his
throat
trying
meanwhile
to
screw
his
courage
to
the
by
the
recitation
of
heroic
poetry
trust
me
to
go
on
with
the
narrative
as
soon
as
i
choose
i
did
want
to
think
of
andy
personally
intuition
whispered
to
me
that
the
swagman
who
would
have
parted
his
last
sprat
to
a
former
mate
had
that
humble
coin
in
his
pocket
whilst
hinted
that
i
had
four
sovereigns
and
some
loose
silver
in
mine
not
to
speak
of
waiting
for
me
in
hay
if
i
had
allowed
my
mind
to
dwell
on
these
two
intrusive
intimations
they
would
have
seemed
to
fit
each
other
like
tenon
and
mortice
though
when
the
opportunity
of
making
the
joint
had
existed
a
sort
of
moral
laziness
together
with
our
artificial
yet
not
unpraiseworthy
repugnance
to
offering
a
money
gift
had
brought
me
out
rather
a
levite
than
a
samaritan
in
mere
i
would
have
been
constrained
to
keep
up
a
series
of
general
and
impersonal
reflections
till
the
swagman
lost
his
individuality
say
five
or
six
hours
but
i
was
rescued
from
this
tyranny
by
the
faint
rattle
of
a
buggy
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
idly
turning
my
glass
on
the
two
occupants
of
the
vehicle
i
recognised
one
of
them
as
a
familiar
and
valued
friend
a
farmer
residing
five
or
six
miles
down
the
river
on
the
victorian
side
i
rose
and
walked
to
the
brink
as
the
buggy
came
opposite
hello
b
i
shouted
hello
collins
i
thought
you
were
way
back
when
did
you
come
down
why
did
you
give
us
a
call
could
get
across
the
river
without
sacrifice
of
dignity
and
comfort
yes
you
can
easy
enough
you
can
start
off
now
i
going
across
here
with
g
to
see
some
sheep
but
i
be
back
toward
sundown
i
tell
you
how
you
manage
follow
straight
down
the
road
till
you
come
to
the
old
nearly
opposite
our
place
then
turn
to
your
left
down
along
the
fence
no
use
b
i
want
to
get
away
and
you
know
when
we
get
together
yes
i
know
all
about
that
but
you
must
come
collins
there
a
dozen
things
i
want
your
opinion
about
indeed
i
appreciate
your
sensible
valuation
of
me
as
a
referee
b
but
i
must
still
decline
i
wish
i
had
gone
this
morning
it
too
late
now
well
i
feel
disappointed
so
will
dick
dick
l
has
turned
up
again
he
at
our
place
now
he
off
next
week
to
fiji
i
suspect
where
has
he
been
this
last
time
you
would
guess
he
been
in
the
holy
land
poked
about
there
for
over
six
months
at
jerusalem
yes
he
been
a
good
deal
in
jerusalem
he
lived
in
jericho
for
a
month
but
he
spent
most
of
his
time
at
different
places
up
and
down
the
jordan
did
he
meet
many
scotchmen
wandering
along
that
river
i
suppose
he
would
meet
a
good
many
anywhere
but
why
there
particularly
well
byron
tells
us
that
on
jordan
banks
the
arab
campbells
stray
i
do
take
neither
do
i
mr
b
but
i
perfectly
serious
tom
i
am
indeed
i
thought
you
would
like
to
have
a
yarn
with
dick
his
descriptions
of
the
holy
land
are
worth
listening
to
say
bright
honour
bright
then
i
say
collins
did
you
ever
have
reason
to
doubt
my
word
no
but
i
always
get
demoralised
out
back
where
were
you
saying
i
could
get
across
the
river
i
thought
that
would
fetch
the
beggar
i
heard
b
remark
to
his
companion
and
he
was
right
it
would
fetch
the
beggar
across
any
river
on
this
continent
dick
l
b
brother
was
a
mine
of
rare
information
and
queer
experiences
educated
for
the
law
his
innate
honesty
had
shrunk
from
the
practice
of
his
profession
and
he
had
taken
to
rambling
as
people
take
to
drink
turning
up
at
irregular
intervals
to
claim
whatever
might
be
available
of
the
per
quarter
bequeathed
to
him
by
his
father
his
strong
point
was
finding
his
way
into
outlandish
places
and
getting
insulted
and
sat
on
by
the
public
and
run
in
by
the
police
apart
from
this
speciality
he
was
one
of
the
most
useless
beings
i
ever
knew
which
is
saying
a
lot
some
men
by
their
very
aspect
seem
to
invite
confidence
others
insult
others
imposition
but
dick
seemed
only
to
invite
arrest
when
he
used
to
be
arrested
in
mistake
for
some
bank
defaulter
when
ragged
he
was
sure
to
be
copped
for
shoplifting
lack
of
lawful
visible
or
for
having
in
his
possession
property
reasonably
supposed
to
have
been
stolen
therefore
honest
as
he
was
he
had
been
like
paul
in
prisons
frequent
but
thanks
to
his
forensic
training
these
interviews
with
the
majesty
of
the
law
seemed
homely
and
grateful
to
him
he
could
converse
with
a
bench
in
such
terms
of
respectful
camaraderie
yet
with
such
suggestiveness
of
an
old
guard
in
reserve
that
his
innocence
became
a
supererogatory
merit
besides
which
he
had
been
in
a
general
way
a
servant
of
servants
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
and
had
been
run
out
of
every
billet
for
utter
incompetency
often
having
to
content
himself
with
a
poor
of
bread
to
this
intolerable
deal
of
sack
so
he
enjoyed
or
otherwise
opportunities
of
seeing
things
that
the
literary
tourist
never
sees
and
being
a
good
talker
and
withal
a
singularly
truthful
man
he
was
excellent
and
profitable
company
after
having
been
on
the
extended
wallaby
where
were
you
saying
i
could
get
across
the
river
mr
b
you
know
the
old
fence
well
follow
that
down
to
the
river
and
just
at
the
end
of
it
you
find
a
bark
canoe
tied
to
the
bank
bark
by
name
and
bark
by
nature
and
you
see
a
fencing
wire
lying
in
the
river
with
the
end
fastened
to
a
tree
when
you
haul
the
wire
up
out
of
the
water
you
find
the
other
end
tied
to
a
tree
on
this
bank
very
complete
rig
and
i
say
collins
mind
you
slacken
the
wire
down
from
this
end
after
you
get
across
on
account
of
steamers
and
snags
and
so
forth
the
canoe
dead
certain
to
be
on
your
side
of
the
river
it
belongs
to
a
couple
of
splitters
living
in
the
hut
and
they
only
use
it
to
come
across
for
rations
or
the
like
of
that
well
we
be
off
g
i
see
you
again
this
evening
then
collins
the
buggy
rattled
away
through
the
i
packed
my
things
in
a
convenient
hollow
tree
and
started
off
down
the
river
followed
by
the
animal
that
constantly
loved
me
although
i
was
poor
about
to
the
i
was
overtaken
and
passed
by
arthur
h
one
of
the
two
brothers
reported
to
be
starting
the
sawmill
and
i
afterward
remembered
that
though
we
saluted
each
other
and
exchanged
impotent
criticisms
on
the
weather
i
had
by
this
time
obtained
such
ascendency
over
the
meddlesome
and
querulous
part
of
my
nature
that
i
had
never
once
thought
of
asking
him
if
he
had
met
andy
it
must
have
been
near
six
in
the
afternoon
when
i
made
my
way
down
the
steep
bank
to
where
the
bark
was
tied
up
i
soon
pulled
the
slack
of
the
wire
out
of
the
bed
of
the
river
and
made
all
fast
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
have
a
smoke
whilst
pulling
across
my
next
thought
was
that
i
could
economise
time
by
deferring
this
duty
till
i
should
resume
my
journey
with
both
hands
at
liberty
forthwith
i
squatted
in
the
canoe
and
got
under
way
leaving
pup
to
follow
at
his
own
convenience
in
a
former
chapter
i
had
occasion
to
notice
a
great
fact
namely
that
the
course
of
each
person
life
is
directed
by
his
option
or
election
now
let
me
glance
at
two
of
my
own
alternatives
each
of
which
has
immediate
bearing
on
the
incident
i
am
about
to
relate
three
weeks
ago
from
the
present
writing
i
had
open
choice
of
all
the
dates
in
diaries
i
actually
dallied
with
that
choice
and
inadvertently
switched
my
loco
on
to
the
line
i
am
now
faithfully
though
reluctantly
following
the
point
of
time
was
that
which
marked
the
penning
of
my
determination
for
a
engine
is
more
likely
to
go
wandering
off
a
straight
line
than
i
am
to
fail
in
fulfilment
of
a
promise
another
alternative
was
accepted
when
my
guardian
angel
suggested
a
smoke
while
crossing
the
river
and
i
declined
on
the
plea
of
haste
a
picaninny
alternative
that
you
say
i
tell
you
it
proved
an
alternative
before
it
ran
itself
out
the
filling
and
lighting
of
my
pipe
would
have
occupied
three
or
four
minutes
and
i
should
have
seen
an
impending
danger
in
time
to
guard
against
it
but
i
shunted
on
to
the
wrong
line
and
nothing
remained
but
to
follow
it
out
to
a
finish
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
whether
even
your
own
discretion
and
address
could
have
carried
the
allotted
trip
to
a
less
unhappy
issue
hand
over
hand
along
the
wire
i
had
wobbled
the
bark
to
the
middle
of
the
stream
when
i
noticed
not
fifty
yards
away
a
dead
tree
of
twelve
or
fifteen
tons
displacement
en
route
for
south
australia
being
about
submerged
and
having
no
branches
on
the
upper
side
it
would
have
passed
under
the
wire
but
for
a
stump
of
a
root
as
thick
as
your
body
standing
about
five
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
water
on
its
forward
end
in
remarking
that
the
tree
was
ong
root
i
merely
mean
to
imply
such
importance
in
that
portion
of
its
substance
that
it
might
rather
be
viewed
as
a
root
with
a
tree
attached
than
as
a
tree
with
a
root
attached
this
is
the
aspect
it
still
retains
in
my
mind
there
was
not
half
enough
time
to
pull
the
bark
ashore
and
sink
the
wire
so
i
did
the
next
best
thing
i
could
as
the
log
approached
i
carefully
rose
to
my
feet
and
held
the
wire
high
enough
to
clear
the
root
nearer
it
came
it
would
pass
the
bark
nicely
within
three
or
four
feet
a
few
seconds
more
and
the
root
would
glide
underneath
the
wire
pup
had
remained
yelping
and
dancing
on
the
bank
for
a
few
minutes
after
my
embarkation
the
kangaroo
dog
having
a
charcoal
burner
antipathy
to
the
bath
but
at
last
becoming
desperate
he
had
plunged
in
and
was
rapidly
approaching
whilst
i
judiciously
gauged
the
height
of
the
root
and
meanwhile
balanced
the
unsteady
bark
under
my
feet
when
the
root
was
within
six
inches
of
the
wire
pup
chin
and
forepaws
were
on
the
gunwale
in
three
seconds
more
i
was
clinging
with
one
hand
to
the
root
the
other
still
mechanically
holding
the
tightening
wire
pup
was
making
for
the
log
and
the
splitters
bark
had
gone
to
davy
jones
locker
in
another
the
wire
parted
and
pup
and
i
were
deck
passengers
ong
root
for
the
land
of
the
i
was
no
more
disconcerted
than
i
am
at
the
present
moment
i
would
go
on
to
b
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
put
up
with
the
inconvenience
of
swimming
the
river
in
the
morning
in
the
meantime
though
i
was
well
splashed
all
the
things
in
my
pockets
were
dry
i
particularly
congratulated
myself
on
the
good
fortune
of
having
been
so
close
to
the
root
at
the
royal
georgeing
of
my
bark
my
bark
well
strictly
speaking
it
was
the
splitters
bark
but
accidents
will
happen
and
i
was
certain
that
not
a
soul
had
seen
me
turn
off
the
main
road
toward
the
river
my
clothes
were
of
the
lightest
i
took
them
off
and
tied
them
in
my
handkerchief
i
pounded
a
depression
in
the
package
to
fit
the
top
of
my
head
and
bound
it
there
with
my
elastic
belt
holding
the
latter
in
my
teeth
you
must
often
have
noticed
that
the
chief
difficulty
of
swimming
with
your
clothes
on
your
head
arises
from
the
surging
of
the
package
with
each
stroke
but
nothing
could
have
been
more
complete
than
my
arrangements
as
i
slid
gently
into
the
water
and
paddled
for
the
cabbage
garden
shore
when
i
had
gone
a
few
yards
my
faithful
companion
now
left
alone
on
the
log
raised
his
voice
in
lamentation
after
the
manner
of
his
subspecies
come
on
pup
i
shouted
without
looking
round
and
the
next
moment
i
felt
as
if
a
big
kangaroo
dog
had
catapulted
himself
through
twenty
feet
of
space
and
lit
on
my
package
after
returning
to
the
surface
and
coughing
about
a
pint
of
water
out
of
my
nose
and
ears
i
looked
uneasily
round
for
my
cargo
it
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
i
swam
back
to
the
log
and
stood
on
it
to
get
a
better
view
good
there
was
the
white
rounded
top
an
inch
above
the
water
ten
yards
away
as
i
swam
toward
it
a
whirlpool
took
it
under
i
dived
after
it
struck
it
smartly
with
the
crown
of
my
head
and
eventually
returned
to
the
log
whence
i
watched
for
its
above
the
water
it
never
following
the
sinuosities
of
the
river
this
must
have
been
a
mile
and
a
half
below
the
splitters
and
time
had
been
passing
for
there
was
the
setting
sun
blazing
through
a
gap
in
the
timber
and
its
mirrored
reflection
stretching
half
a
mile
of
dazzling
radiance
along
a
straight
reach
of
the
river
now
though
the
murray
is
the
most
crooked
river
on
earth
its
general
tendency
is
directly
from
east
to
west
would
you
therefore
if
you
were
on
a
floating
log
remote
unfriended
melancholy
slow
standing
like
the
apollo
sauroctones
with
your
hand
on
the
adjacent
stump
and
to
enhance
your
resemblance
to
that
fine
antique
clad
in
simplicity
of
mien
and
nothing
else
if
you
were
sadly
realising
the
loss
of
your
best
clothes
with
all
the
things
in
the
pockets
including
a
fairly
trustworthy
watch
if
in
addition
to
this
the
patient
face
of
the
spratless
swagman
was
rising
before
you
till
you
involuntarily
muttered
o
julius
caesar
thou
art
mighty
yet
and
the
nasty
part
of
your
moral
nature
was
reminding
you
that
you
might
have
had
anything
up
to
worth
of
heavenly
debentures
whereas
having
failed
to
put
your
mammon
of
unrighteousness
into
celestial
scrip
to
await
you
at
the
end
of
your
pilgrimage
you
were
now
doubly
debarred
from
retaining
it
in
your
pilgrim
scrip
by
reason
of
having
neither
scrip
nor
mammon
under
such
circumstances
i
say
would
you
be
very
likely
to
take
the
sunset
on
your
left
and
swim
for
the
north
bank
without
doing
an
equation
in
algebra
to
find
out
which
way
the
river
ought
to
run
that
is
what
i
did
it
never
occurred
to
my
mind
that
victoria
could
be
on
the
north
side
of
new
south
wales
after
shouting
myself
hoarse
and
whistling
on
my
fingers
till
my
lips
were
paralysed
i
brought
pup
into
view
on
the
south
and
supposedly
victorian
bank
opposite
where
i
had
landed
by
the
time
i
had
induced
him
to
take
the
water
and
rejoin
me
the
short
twilight
was
gone
and
night
had
set
in
dark
starless
hot
and
full
of
electricity
and
the
mosquitos
well
those
who
have
been
much
in
the
open
air
in
godiva
costume
during
opaque
perspiring
november
nights
about
lake
cooper
or
the
lower
goulburn
or
the
murray
frontage
require
no
reminder
and
to
those
who
have
not
had
such
experience
no
illustration
could
convey
any
adequate
notion
hyperbolically
however
in
the
localities
i
have
mentioned
the
severity
of
the
periodical
plague
goads
the
instinct
of
animals
almost
to
the
standard
of
reason
not
only
will
horses
gather
round
a
fire
to
avail
themselves
of
the
smoke
but
it
is
quite
a
usual
thing
to
see
some
experienced
old
stager
sitting
on
his
haunches
and
dexterously
filliping
his
front
shoes
over
a
little
heap
of
dry
leaves
and
bark
to
return
the
recollection
of
much
worse
predicaments
in
the
past
and
the
reasonable
anticipation
of
still
worse
in
the
future
restored
that
equilibrium
of
temper
which
is
the
aim
of
my
life
and
i
felt
cheerful
enough
as
i
welcomed
my
dripping
companion
and
taking
a
leafy
twig
in
each
hand
to
switch
myself
withal
started
northward
for
the
river
road
which
i
purposed
following
eastward
to
where
the
pad
branched
off
and
then
running
the
latter
to
my
camp
once
clear
of
the
river
timber
and
with
the
road
for
a
base
the
darkness
i
thought
would
make
little
difference
to
me
after
half
an
hour
gliding
through
heavy
forest
and
cleaving
my
way
through
spongy
and
circling
round
black
lagoons
alive
with
the
plump
plump
of
bullfrogs
and
the
interminable
of
yabbies
i
found
the
river
on
my
right
with
a
along
the
bank
here
was
something
definite
to
go
upon
by
keeping
straight
on
i
must
soon
strike
the
old
fence
where
the
splitters
used
to
keep
their
bark
and
in
an
hour
and
more
i
would
be
at
my
camp
but
the
discerning
reader
will
perceive
from
hints
already
given
that
by
following
the
cattle
track
with
the
river
on
my
right
i
was
unconsciously
travelling
westward
on
the
victorian
side
instead
of
eastward
on
the
new
south
wales
side
if
the
sky
had
cleared
for
a
single
instant
a
glance
at
the
familiar
constellations
would
have
set
me
right
after
half
a
mile
the
intersected
a
beaten
road
with
the
black
masses
of
river
timber
still
on
the
right
and
a
wire
fence
on
the
left
as
i
found
by
running
into
it
everything
seemed
unfamiliar
and
puzzling
but
i
followed
the
road
looking
out
for
landmarks
and
zealously
switching
myself
as
i
went
along
soon
i
heard
in
front
the
trampling
of
horses
and
men
voices
in
jolly
conversation
i
aimed
for
the
sounds
and
after
running
against
a
loose
horse
feeding
leisurely
on
the
grass
i
distinguished
through
the
hot
stagnant
darkness
the
approaching
forms
of
three
men
riding
abreast
good
evening
gentlemen
said
i
politely
switching
myself
as
i
spoke
could
you
give
me
some
idea
of
the
geography
i
got
no
farther
for
a
colt
that
one
of
the
fellows
was
riding
suddenly
shied
at
me
and
followed
up
the
action
by
bucking
his
best
upon
this
the
loose
horse
presented
himself
cavorting
round
in
senseless
emulation
while
the
other
two
horses
swerved
and
tried
to
bolt
all
this
took
place
in
half
a
minute
the
rider
of
the
colt
was
taken
by
surprise
but
he
was
plucky
though
losing
not
only
his
stirrups
but
his
saddle
with
the
first
buck
he
spent
the
next
couple
of
minutes
riding
all
over
that
colt
sometimes
on
his
ears
and
sometimes
on
his
tail
but
this
sort
of
thing
could
last
it
never
does
last
so
after
hanging
on
for
about
twenty
seconds
by
one
heel
the
fellow
dismounted
like
a
of
sludge
during
this
time
i
saw
nothing
of
the
two
other
men
but
i
could
hear
them
trying
to
force
their
excited
horses
toward
the
spot
where
i
was
skipping
round
ready
to
catch
the
colt
on
the
moment
of
his
discharging
cargo
on
making
the
attempt
i
missed
the
bridle
in
the
dark
and
away
shot
the
colt
in
one
direction
and
the
loose
horse
in
another
i
bet
a
note
jack
off
said
a
voice
from
the
distance
gosh
you
win
it
if
it
was
twenty
responded
another
voice
from
the
ground
close
by
there
goes
his
moke
said
the
first
voice
come
and
jam
the
beggar
against
the
fence
or
he
be
off
to
glory
and
away
clattered
the
two
horsemen
after
the
wrong
horse
jack
following
on
foot
noticing
their
mistake
i
cantered
hopefully
after
the
colt
thinking
to
obtain
a
favourable
introduction
to
jack
by
restoring
the
animal
but
in
a
few
minutes
i
lost
the
sounds
and
abandoned
the
pursuit
then
after
supplying
myself
with
fresh
switches
i
resumed
my
fatal
westward
course
more
voices
a
short
distance
away
and
straight
in
front
judging
them
to
come
from
some
vehicle
travelling
at
a
slow
walk
along
the
edge
of
the
timber
i
posted
myself
behind
a
tree
and
waited
as
patiently
as
the
mosquitos
permitted
now
you
need
scandalise
one
another
said
a
pleasant
masculine
voice
you
like
the
pot
and
the
kettle
you
both
as
full
of
sin
and
hypocrisy
as
you
can
stick
six
of
one
and
of
the
other
i
would
have
believed
it
if
i
had
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
you
disgraced
yourselves
for
ever
who
the
dickens
do
you
think
would
be
fool
enough
to
marry
either
of
you
after
the
way
you
behaved
yourselves
well
i
sure
we
not
asking
you
to
marry
us
piped
a
feminine
voice
keep
yourselves
in
that
mind
for
goodness
sake
i
disgusted
with
you
why
only
last
sunday
i
heard
your
two
mothers
flattering
themselves
about
the
c
girls
knowing
too
much
and
i
swear
you
both
forgot
more
than
the
c
girls
ever
knew
you
as
common
as
o
you
mighty
modest
your
own
self
retorted
a
second
feminine
voice
it
my
place
to
be
a
bit
rowdy
replied
the
superior
sex
it
part
of
a
man
education
and
i
do
try
to
look
as
if
butter
would
melt
in
my
mouth
you
just
the
reverse
you
hypocrites
unto
you
hypocrites
the
bible
says
but
it
troubling
me
a
good
deal
to
think
what
your
mothers
feel
now
that
you
come
out
in
your
true
colours
but
you
would
be
mean
enough
to
tell
interrupted
one
of
the
sweet
voices
i
always
thought
you
were
too
honourable
to
do
such
a
thing
harry
remarked
the
other
well
now
you
find
your
mistake
but
this
is
not
a
question
of
honour
it
a
question
of
duty
o
you
mighty
fine
with
your
duty
you
a
mean
wretch
there
i
be
a
meaner
wretch
before
another
hour
over
go
on
jerry
let
get
it
past
and
done
with
but
harry
i
say
harry
do
tell
i
never
forgive
you
if
you
do
duty
mabel
duty
what
good
will
it
do
you
to
tell
pleaded
the
other
voice
duty
annie
duty
on
you
go
jerry
and
let
get
home
this
is
painful
to
a
cove
of
my
temperament
during
this
conversation
i
had
become
conscious
of
standing
on
a
populous
and
not
wishing
to
lose
the
chance
of
an
interview
with
harry
i
had
retreated
in
front
of
the
buggy
till
a
second
tree
offered
its
friendly
cover
jerry
head
was
now
within
two
yards
of
my
ambush
and
peeping
round
i
could
make
out
the
vague
outline
of
the
figures
in
the
buggy
well
i
tell
you
what
i
do
said
harry
stopping
the
horse
if
each
of
you
gives
me
a
kiss
of
her
own
good
will
i
promise
not
to
tell
are
you
on
say
the
word
for
i
only
give
you
one
minute
to
decide
what
do
you
think
mabel
murmured
one
of
the
voices
well
i
got
no
but
what
do
you
think
i
think
it
about
the
only
thing
we
can
do
we
would
never
be
let
come
out
again
there
was
perfect
silence
for
a
minute
my
tree
was
a
large
one
and
the
near
front
wheel
of
the
buggy
was
almost
against
it
not
daring
to
move
hand
or
foot
i
could
only
wish
myself
a
rhinoceros
come
on
said
one
of
the
voices
at
last
come
on
how
asked
harry
innocently
look
here
the
agreement
is
that
each
of
you
is
to
give
me
a
kiss
of
her
own
good
will
i
not
going
to
move
o
you
horrid
wretch
do
you
think
we
going
to
demean
ourselves
you
mighty
mistaken
if
you
do
go
on
jerry
and
the
buggy
started
we
not
frightened
of
you
now
remarked
one
of
the
voices
complacently
whilst
i
threw
myself
on
the
ground
and
rolled
like
a
liberated
horse
if
you
dare
to
say
one
single
word
we
just
expose
your
shameful
proposal
you
mean
wretch
you
make
people
think
it
safe
to
send
their
girls
with
you
to
be
insulted
like
this
o
we
expose
you
expose
away
and
do
forget
to
mention
that
you
both
agreed
to
the
shameful
proposal
i
tell
your
mothers
that
i
made
that
proposal
just
to
try
you
and
you
consented
on
condition
of
me
keeping
quiet
you
both
up
a
tree
in
the
balances
and
found
wanting
mene
mene
tekel
upharsin
go
on
jerry
and
let
have
it
over
what
do
you
think
annie
asked
one
of
the
voices
whilst
i
made
for
my
third
tree
he
the
meanest
wretch
that
ever
breathed
replied
the
other
vehemently
and
i
always
thought
men
was
so
honourable
live
and
learn
rejoined
the
escort
pithily
o
harry
panted
one
voice
i
seen
a
white
thing
darting
across
there
quite
likely
replied
harry
when
a
girl
gone
cronk
like
you
she
must
expect
to
see
white
things
darting
about
but
i
give
you
one
more
chance
i
think
we
better
suggested
one
of
the
voices
there
nothing
else
for
it
assented
the
other
by
this
time
the
buggy
had
disappeared
in
the
darkness
i
heard
it
stop
then
followed
with
slight
intervals
two
unsyllabled
sounds
over
again
said
harry
calmly
you
both
cheated
the
sounds
were
repeated
over
again
you
have
to
alter
your
hand
a
bit
both
of
you
or
be
here
all
night
slower
this
time
once
more
the
sounds
were
repeated
then
the
buggy
started
and
harry
voice
died
away
in
the
distance
to
an
indistinct
murmur
as
he
reviled
the
girls
for
this
new
exhibition
of
their
shamelessness
whilst
undecided
whether
to
follow
the
buggy
any
further
i
saw
a
light
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
making
my
way
toward
it
i
crossed
a
fence
bounding
a
roughly
ploughed
fallow
paddock
and
then
a
fence
wondering
all
the
while
that
i
had
never
noticed
the
place
when
passing
it
in
daylight
at
last
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
road
a
white
house
loomed
before
me
with
the
light
in
a
front
window
i
opened
the
gate
of
the
flower
garden
and
was
soon
crouched
under
the
window
taking
stock
of
the
interior
a
woman
was
sitting
by
the
table
darning
socks
and
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
lamp
sat
a
girl
in
holiday
attire
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
her
fingers
in
her
hair
reading
some
illustrated
journal
while
a
little
boy
squatted
behind
the
girl
chair
was
attaching
a
possum
tail
to
her
improver
like
enoch
arden
in
my
own
little
way
i
turned
silently
and
sadly
from
the
window
for
i
was
wanted
in
that
company
i
thought
of
going
round
to
the
back
premises
in
search
of
a
men
hut
but
before
regaining
the
gate
i
trod
on
a
porcupine
cactus
and
forgot
everything
else
for
the
time
then
as
i
lay
on
the
ground
outside
the
gate
caressing
the
sole
of
my
foot
and
comforting
myself
with
the
thought
that
a
brave
man
battling
with
the
storms
of
fate
is
a
sight
worthy
the
admiration
of
the
gods
a
white
dog
came
tearing
round
from
the
back
yard
and
rushed
at
me
like
a
coming
event
casting
its
shadow
before
soolim
pup
i
hissed
that
was
enough
pup
colour
rendered
him
invisible
in
the
dark
and
his
strain
made
him
formidable
when
he
was
on
the
job
the
office
of
a
has
its
duties
as
well
as
its
rights
and
in
half
a
minute
that
farm
dog
found
that
one
of
these
duties
demanded
a
efficiency
with
which
nature
had
omitted
to
endow
him
he
found
that
though
the
stereotyped
tactics
of
worrying
and
freezing
and
chawing
were
good
enough
as
opposed
to
similar
procedure
they
became
mere
bookish
theories
when
confronted
with
the
snapping
system
eviction
becomes
tedious
when
the
intruder
teeth
are
always
meeting
in
the
hind
quarters
of
the
ejecting
party
and
the
latter
can
neither
get
his
antagonist
in
front
of
him
nor
haul
off
to
investigate
damage
of
course
i
fanned
the
flame
of
discord
as
well
as
i
could
hoping
that
some
one
of
my
own
denomination
would
come
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
but
no
the
parlour
door
opened
mam
came
out
to
the
gate
and
in
the
broad
bar
of
light
extending
from
the
door
i
saw
her
pick
up
a
clod
and
aim
it
at
the
rolling
dun
i
was
crouching
some
yards
away
to
one
side
but
the
clod
crumbled
against
my
ear
then
the
storm
of
battle
went
raging
round
the
back
premises
as
the
farm
dog
returned
to
tell
egypt
the
story
mam
retreated
from
the
gate
in
haste
and
for
a
minute
or
two
there
was
a
confused
clatter
of
voices
in
the
house
and
some
opening
and
shutting
of
doors
then
all
was
silent
again
presently
pup
returned
and
accompanied
me
back
to
the
road
carrying
something
which
i
ascertained
to
be
a
large
fowl
plucked
and
dressed
in
readiness
for
cooking
musing
on
the
difficulties
of
this
wonderland
into
which
according
to
immemorial
usage
i
had
been
born
without
a
rag
of
clothes
i
waited
for
pup
whilst
he
ate
his
fowl
and
then
again
pressed
forward
alert
and
vigilant
as
beseemed
a
man
scudding
under
bare
poles
through
an
apparently
populous
country
which
by
right
ought
to
have
been
a
sheeprun
with
about
one
selection
every
five
miles
i
had
managed
to
put
another
mile
between
myself
and
my
camp
when
two
horsemen
met
and
passed
me
at
a
canter
singing
one
of
sankey
melodies
i
made
a
modest
appeal
but
they
did
hear
me
and
so
passed
on
unconscious
of
their
lost
opportunity
then
i
saw
a
long
way
ahead
the
lamps
of
an
approaching
vehicle
and
at
the
same
time
i
heard
close
in
front
the
trampling
of
horses
and
voices
raised
in
careless
glee
i
headed
straight
for
the
horses
as
i
neared
them
the
laughing
and
chatting
ceased
and
i
was
about
to
open
negotiations
when
a
woman
voice
asked
wha
what
that
white
thing
there
in
front
before
the
last
syllable
had
left
her
lips
that
white
thing
was
receding
into
the
darkness
like
a
comet
into
space
the
party
stopped
for
a
minute
and
then
went
on
conversing
in
a
lower
tone
more
pilgrims
of
the
night
this
time
the
slow
footfalls
of
horses
and
a
low
inarticulate
murmur
of
voices
out
in
front
and
a
little
to
the
left
gave
me
fresh
hope
warned
by
past
failures
i
thought
best
to
forego
the
erect
posture
to
which
our
species
owes
so
much
of
its
majesty
i
therefore
dropped
on
and
went
like
a
tarantula
till
i
distinguished
two
horses
walking
slowly
abreast
jammed
together
the
riders
presenting
an
indistinct
outline
of
two
individuals
rolled
into
one
and
it
was
from
this
amalgamation
that
the
low
murmurs
proceeded
an
instinct
of
delicacy
prompted
me
to
pause
and
let
the
siamese
twins
pass
in
peace
but
unfortunately
i
happened
to
be
straight
in
the
way
and
just
as
i
started
to
creep
aside
one
of
the
horses
extended
his
neck
and
with
a
low
protracted
snore
touched
me
on
the
back
with
the
coarse
velvet
of
his
nose
then
followed
two
quick
snorts
of
alarm
the
horses
shied
simultaneously
outward
while
down
on
the
ground
between
them
came
two
souls
with
but
a
single
thud
two
hearts
that
squelched
as
one
in
spite
of
the
compunction
and
sympathy
i
felt
modesty
compelled
me
to
glide
unobstrusively
away
leaving
the
souls
to
disentangle
themselves
and
catch
their
horses
the
best
way
they
could
by
this
time
the
buggy
lamps
had
approached
within
fifty
yards
knowing
how
dense
the
outside
darkness
would
appear
to
anyone
in
the
vehicle
i
made
a
circuit
and
got
round
to
the
rear
it
was
a
buggy
with
a
white
horse
travelling
at
a
walk
and
in
the
darkness
behind
the
lamps
two
figures
were
discernible
i
followed
a
little
to
hear
them
introduce
themselves
they
did
so
as
follows
now
archie
i
scream
my
own
sweetest
letmego
o
why
the
district
was
fairly
bristling
with
this
class
of
people
i
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
except
in
the
flagstaff
gardens
when
i
was
in
melbourne
my
precious
darling
my
sweetest
o
my
sweetest
my
beautiful
o
there
then
sweetest
kiss
me
now
yes
archie
my
precious
love
there
was
more
of
it
but
it
fell
unheeded
on
my
ears
i
paused
and
thought
vehemently
the
white
horse
in
the
buggy
and
archie
m
superintendent
of
the
e
sunday
school
with
his
girl
no
wonder
i
had
met
so
many
people
and
all
going
in
the
same
direction
they
were
the
sediment
of
the
party
returning
from
their
orgy
here
was
the
lost
chord
the
whole
truth
flashed
upon
me
now
the
solid
earth
wheeled
face
east
became
west
and
west
east
i
recognised
the
victorian
river
road
because
i
saw
things
as
they
were
not
as
i
had
imagined
them
though
to
be
sure
i
still
saw
them
as
through
a
glass
darkly
my
friend
let
us
draw
a
lesson
from
this
if
you
have
never
been
bushed
your
immunity
is
by
no
means
an
evidence
of
your
cleverness
but
rather
a
proof
that
your
experience
of
the
wilderness
is
small
if
you
have
been
bushed
you
will
remember
how
as
you
struck
a
place
you
knew
error
was
suddenly
superseded
by
a
flash
of
truth
this
without
volition
of
judgment
on
your
part
and
entirely
by
force
of
a
presentation
of
fact
which
your
own
personal
error
however
sincere
and
stubborn
had
never
affected
and
which
you
were
no
longer
in
a
position
to
repudiate
it
has
always
been
my
strong
impression
that
this
is
very
much
like
the
revelation
which
follows
death
that
is
if
conscious
individuality
be
preserved
a
thing
by
no
means
certain
and
to
my
mind
not
manifestly
desirable
but
if
after
closing
our
eyes
in
death
we
open
them
on
an
appreciable
hereafter
whether
one
imperceptible
fraction
of
a
second
or
a
million
centuries
may
intervene
it
is
as
certain
as
anything
can
be
that
to
most
of
us
the
true
east
will
prove
to
be
our
former
and
the
true
west
our
former
how
many
virtues
will
vanish
then
and
how
many
objectionable
fads
will
shine
as
with
the
glory
of
god
this
much
is
certain
that
all
private
wealth
beyond
simplest
maintenance
will
seem
as
the
spoils
of
the
street
gutter
that
fashion
will
be
as
the
gilded
fly
which
infests
carrion
that
sport
will
seem
folly
that
would
disgrace
an
idiot
that
military
force
embattled
on
behalf
of
royalty
or
aristocracy
or
capital
will
seem
like
well
what
will
it
seem
like
already
looking
or
rather
squinting
back
along
our
rugged
and
random
track
we
perceive
that
the
bloodiest
battle
ever
fought
by
our
forefathers
on
british
soil
and
that
only
one
of
a
series
of
twelve
in
which
fathers
sons
brothers
kinsmen
and
exterminated
each
other
was
fought
to
decide
whether
a
drivelling
imbecile
or
a
shameless
lecher
should
bring
our
said
forefathers
under
the
operation
of
i
samuel
viii
read
the
chapter
for
yourself
my
friend
if
you
know
where
you
can
borrow
a
bible
then
turn
back
these
pages
and
take
a
second
glance
at
the
paragraphs
you
skimmed
over
in
that
unteachable
spirit
which
is
the
primary
element
of
ignorance
namely
those
reflections
on
the
unfettered
alternative
followed
by
rigorous
destiny
much
more
prosaic
were
my
cogitations
as
i
followed
the
buggy
keeping
both
switches
at
work
according
to
the
best
calculation
i
could
make
i
had
ten
or
twelve
miles
of
country
to
besides
the
river
and
having
no
base
on
the
victorian
side
it
was
a
thousand
to
one
against
striking
my
camp
on
such
a
night
of
course
i
might
have
groped
my
way
to
b
place
but
if
you
knew
b
fatuous
appreciation
of
dilemmas
like
mine
you
would
understand
that
such
a
thing
was
not
to
be
thought
of
i
preferred
dealing
with
strangers
alone
and
preserving
a
strict
incognito
however
a
pair
of
i
must
have
if
nothing
else
and
that
immediately
the
buggy
was
fifteen
or
twenty
yards
ahead
archie
m
said
i
in
a
firm
penetrating
tone
the
buggy
stopped
i
repeated
my
salute
all
right
replied
archie
what
the
matter
come
here
i
want
you
the
quadrant
of
light
swept
round
as
the
young
fellow
turned
his
buggy
leave
your
buggy
and
come
alone
i
shouted
careering
in
a
circular
orbit
with
the
light
at
my
very
heels
well
i
must
say
you
hard
to
please
whoever
you
are
remarked
archie
stopping
the
horse
hold
the
reins
sweetest
who
is
it
asked
the
damsel
with
apprehension
in
her
tone
do
know
sweetest
sounds
like
the
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
and
the
light
flashed
on
him
as
he
felt
downward
for
the
step
do
go
she
exclaimed
never
mind
her
archie
i
called
out
she
a
fool
come
on
what
on
earth
the
matter
with
you
asked
archie
addressing
the
darkness
in
my
direction
i
clothed
in
tribulation
ca
explain
further
come
on
o
come
on
do
go
i
tell
you
archie
and
in
the
bright
light
of
the
off
lamp
i
saw
her
clutch
the
after
part
of
his
coat
as
he
stood
on
the
i
must
go
sweetest
good
lad
i
exclaimed
i
be
back
in
a
minute
let
go
sweetest
do
leave
me
archie
i
frightened
just
a
few
minutes
ago
i
saw
a
white
thing
gliding
past
spectral
illusion
most
likely
there
was
a
murdered
here
by
the
blacks
thirty
years
ago
and
they
say
he
walks
occasionally
but
he
ca
hurt
you
even
if
he
tried
now
let
go
sweetest
and
i
say
you
a
good
girl
archie
you
cruel
and
i
love
you
do
leave
me
sweetest
was
in
tears
this
is
ridiculous
i
exclaimed
come
on
archie
i
wo
keep
you
a
minute
the
mountain
ca
go
to
mahomet
and
to
state
the
alternative
would
be
an
insult
to
your
erudition
come
on
o
archie
let
get
away
out
of
this
fearful
place
sobbed
the
wretched
obstruction
do
what
i
ask
you
this
once
and
i
be
like
a
slave
the
rest
of
my
life
well
mind
you
do
forget
when
the
fright
over
replied
archie
resuming
his
seat
that
poor
beggar
has
something
on
his
mind
whoever
he
is
but
he
have
to
pay
the
penalty
of
his
dignity
too
true
said
i
to
myself
as
archie
started
off
at
a
trot
for
the
dignity
is
like
that
of
pompey
statue
austerest
form
of
naked
majesty
a
dignity
i
would
gladly
exchange
for
what
goldsmith
thoughtlessly
calls
glaring
impotence
of
dress
i
followed
the
buggy
at
a
chinaman
trot
thinking
the
thing
over
and
switching
myself
desperately
for
the
night
was
getting
hotter
and
darker
and
mosquitos
livelier
you
will
bear
in
mind
that
i
was
now
retracing
my
way
keeping
on
the
track
which
skirted
the
river
timber
the
cool
impalpable
dust
being
grateful
to
my
bare
feet
i
heard
some
people
on
horseback
pass
along
the
parallel
track
which
ran
by
the
fence
demoralised
by
the
conditions
of
my
unhappy
state
i
again
paused
to
eavesdrop
good
one
fellow
was
relating
an
anecdote
suited
to
gentlemen
only
thanking
providence
for
the
tendency
of
the
yarn
i
darted
diagonally
across
the
clearing
to
intercept
these
brethren
and
was
rapidly
nearing
the
party
when
pup
thinking
i
was
after
something
crossed
my
course
in
the
dark
i
tripped
over
him
and
landed
some
yards
ahead
in
one
of
the
five
patches
of
nettles
in
the
county
of
moira
by
the
time
i
had
cleared
myself
and
recovered
my
equanimity
the
horsemen
had
improved
their
pace
and
were
out
of
reach
a
few
minutes
afterward
i
became
aware
of
the
footfalls
of
a
single
horse
coming
along
behind
me
at
a
slow
trot
i
paused
to
make
one
more
solicitation
when
the
horseman
was
within
twenty
yards
of
where
i
stood
he
pulled
up
and
dismounted
then
he
struck
a
match
and
began
looking
on
the
ground
for
something
he
had
dropped
the
horse
shied
at
the
light
and
refused
to
lead
whereupon
after
giving
the
animal
a
few
kicks
he
threw
the
reins
over
a
post
of
the
fence
close
by
and
continued
his
search
lighting
fresh
matches
assuming
an
air
of
unconcern
so
as
to
avoid
taking
him
by
surprise
i
drew
nearer
and
noted
him
as
a
large
fair
young
man
fashionably
dressed
good
evening
sir
said
i
urbanely
with
that
peculiar
form
of
rudeness
which
provokes
me
most
he
flashed
a
match
on
me
instead
of
replying
to
my
salutation
are
you
satisfied
i
asked
sardonically
switching
myself
the
while
and
still
capering
from
the
effect
of
the
nettles
he
darted
towards
his
horse
but
before
he
reached
the
bridle
my
hand
was
on
his
shoulder
what
do
you
want
he
gasped
i
want
your
i
replied
sternly
i
getting
full
up
of
the
admiration
of
the
gods
i
want
the
admiration
of
my
in
other
words
i
replete
with
the
leading
trait
of
adamic
innocence
i
want
the
sartorial
concomitants
of
adamic
guilt
come
off
with
them
and
with
that
i
snapped
the
laces
of
his
balmorals
for
he
had
sunk
to
the
ground
and
was
lying
on
his
back
and
seeing
that
i
may
as
well
be
hanged
for
a
whole
suit
as
for
a
pair
of
i
just
take
the
complete
outer
ply
while
my
hand
in
leaving
you
whatever
may
be
underneath
let
me
impress
upon
you
that
i
do
attempt
to
defend
this
action
on
strictly
moral
grounds
i
continued
peeling
off
his
coat
and
waistcoat
with
the
celerity
of
a
skilful
butcher
skinning
a
sheep
for
a
bet
i
think
we
may
regard
the
transaction
as
a
pertinent
illustration
of
pandulph
aphorism
to
wit
that
who
stands
upon
a
slippery
place
makes
nice
of
no
vile
hold
to
stay
him
up
when
the
done
i
must
get
you
to
favour
me
with
your
address
so
that
here
my
antagonist
suddenly
gave
tongue
during
an
eventful
life
i
have
frequently
had
occasion
to
observe
that
when
woman
finds
herself
in
a
tight
place
her
first
impulse
is
to
set
the
wild
echoes
flying
whereas
man
resists
or
submits
in
silence
except
perhaps
for
a
few
bad
words
ground
out
between
his
teeth
therefore
when
the
legal
owner
of
the
which
i
was
in
the
act
of
unfastening
suddenly
splintered
the
firmament
with
a
screech
the
thought
flashed
on
my
mind
that
he
was
one
of
those
de
lacy
evanses
we
often
read
of
in
novels
and
in
two
seconds
i
was
fifty
yards
away
trying
to
choose
between
the
opposing
anomalies
of
the
case
a
little
reflection
showed
the
balance
of
probability
strongly
against
a
disguise
which
i
have
never
met
with
in
actual
life
but
by
this
time
i
heard
the
clatter
of
horses
feet
approaching
rapidly
from
both
sides
the
prospective
violation
of
my
incognito
by
a
audience
made
my
position
more
and
more
admirable
from
a
mythological
point
of
view
so
i
straightway
vaulted
over
the
fence
and
lay
down
among
some
cockspurs
within
the
next
few
minutes
several
people
on
horseback
came
up
to
the
scene
of
the
late
attempted
outrage
i
ca
give
the
exact
number
of
course
as
i
could
only
judge
by
sound
but
there
might
have
been
half
a
dozen
a
good
deal
of
animated
conversation
followed
some
of
it
i
thought
in
a
feminine
voice
then
the
whole
party
went
trampling
along
the
fence
close
to
my
ambush
and
away
out
of
hearing
the
mosquitos
were
worse
than
ever
i
pulled
two
handfuls
of
crop
to
replace
the
switches
i
had
thrown
away
on
attempting
to
cajole
the
chevalier
out
of
his
my
mind
was
made
up
i
would
solicit
this
impracticable
generation
no
longer
i
would
follow
the
river
road
for
eight
or
ten
miles
and
then
wait
in
some
secluded
spot
for
the
first
peep
of
daylight
i
began
to
blame
myself
for
not
having
gone
straight
on
when
archie
unconsciously
gave
me
my
longitude
to
get
home
in
the
dark
was
of
course
entirely
out
of
the
question
all
that
i
could
do
was
to
aim
approximately
in
the
right
direction
i
was
pacing
along
at
the
double
when
a
lighted
window
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
from
the
road
attracted
my
attention
like
frankenstein
unhappy
monster
i
had
a
hankering
just
then
for
human
vicinity
though
like
it
i
met
with
nothing
but
horrified
repulse
you
will
notice
that
shelley
with
true
womanly
delicacy
avoids
saying
in
so
many
words
that
the
student
omitted
to
equip
his
abnormal
creation
with
a
pair
of
but
frankenstein
oversight
in
this
matter
will
i
think
sufficiently
account
for
that
furtive
besiegement
of
human
homes
that
pathetic
fascination
for
the
neighbourhood
of
man
which
so
long
refused
to
accept
rebuff
with
man
is
whole
as
the
marble
founded
as
the
rock
as
broad
and
general
as
the
casing
air
without
unaccommodated
man
is
no
more
but
such
a
poor
bare
forked
animal
as
thou
art
the
standard
is
the
labarum
of
modern
civilisation
by
this
sign
shall
we
conquer
since
that
night
by
the
murray
methinks
each
pair
of
i
see
hanging
in
front
of
a
draper
shop
seems
to
bear
aright
in
hoc
signo
vinces
scrolled
in
haughty
blazonry
across
its
widest
part
and
since
that
time
i
note
and
condemn
the
unworthy
satire
which
makes
the
somnambulistic
knight
of
la
mancha
slash
the
wine
skins
in
nothing
but
an
under
garment
reaching
says
one
of
our
translations
only
down
to
the
small
of
his
back
behind
and
shorter
still
in
front
exposing
a
pair
of
legs
very
long
and
very
thin
and
very
hairy
and
very
dirty
strange
to
think
that
man
noble
in
reason
infinite
in
faculty
and
so
forth
should
depend
so
entirely
for
his
dignity
upon
a
pair
of
but
such
is
life
approaching
the
house
i
judged
by
the
style
of
window
curtains
that
the
light
was
in
a
bedroom
i
made
my
way
to
the
front
door
and
knocked
who
there
inquired
a
discouraging
soprano
a
most
poor
man
made
tame
by
fortune
blows
i
replied
humbly
is
the
boss
at
home
yes
she
exclaimed
in
a
hysterical
tone
would
you
be
kind
enough
to
tell
him
i
want
him
clear
off
or
it
be
worse
for
you
she
screamed
it
ca
be
much
worse
will
you
please
tell
the
boss
i
want
him
i
let
the
dog
loose
that
what
i
do
i
got
him
here
in
the
room
with
me
and
he
savage
no
more
so
than
yourself
will
you
please
tell
the
boss
i
want
him
clear
off
this
minute
there
plenty
of
your
sort
knockin
about
heaven
pity
them
then
i
murmured
sorrowfully
and
i
went
round
to
the
back
yard
in
hope
of
finding
something
on
the
but
it
was
only
labour
lost
i
was
on
my
way
back
to
the
road
when
i
saw
another
lighted
window
the
reason
i
had
seen
so
few
lights
was
simple
enough
as
a
rule
farmers
families
spend
their
evenings
in
the
back
dining
room
and
the
front
of
the
house
remains
dark
until
they
are
retiring
for
the
night
when
you
may
see
the
front
bedroom
window
lighted
for
a
few
minutes
turning
toward
the
new
beacon
i
waded
through
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
tall
wheat
which
occasionally
eclipsed
the
light
when
i
emerged
from
the
wheat
the
light
was
gone
however
i
found
the
house
and
went
prowling
round
the
back
yard
till
i
roused
two
these
faithful
animals
fraternised
with
pup
while
i
prospected
the
premises
thoroughly
but
without
finding
even
an
empty
or
a
dry
barrel
with
both
ends
out
in
making
my
way
back
to
the
road
i
noticed
far
away
in
the
river
timber
the
red
light
of
a
this
was
the
best
sight
i
had
seen
since
sunset
some
swagman
camp
beyond
doubt
i
could
safely
count
on
the
hospitality
for
the
night
and
his
help
in
the
morning
if
he
had
any
spare
i
would
borrow
them
if
not
i
would
first
thing
in
the
morning
send
him
cadging
round
the
neighbourhood
for
clothes
while
i
sought
in
his
blanket
this
was
not
too
much
to
count
on
for
i
have
yet
to
find
the
churlish
or
unfeeling
swagman
whereas
my
late
experience
of
the
respectable
classes
had
not
been
satisfactory
at
all
events
the
fire
would
give
me
respite
from
the
mosquitos
encouraged
by
this
brightening
prospect
i
crossed
the
road
and
entered
on
the
heavy
timber
and
broken
ground
of
the
river
frontage
but
all
preceding
difficulties
in
comparison
with
those
which
now
confronted
me
were
as
the
greek
tartarus
to
the
hebrew
tophet
so
intense
was
the
darkness
in
the
bush
that
i
simply
saw
nothing
except
at
irregular
intervals
the
spark
of
red
fire
often
away
to
right
or
left
when
i
had
lost
my
dead
reckoning
through
groping
round
the
slimy
rotten
margins
of
deep
lagoons
or
creeping
like
a
native
bear
over
fallen
timber
or
tacking
round
clumps
of
prickly
scrub
or
tumbling
into
billabongs
i
could
show
you
the
place
in
daylight
and
you
would
say
it
was
one
of
the
worst
spots
on
the
river
still
in
pursuance
of
my
custom
i
endeavoured
to
find
tongues
in
the
mosquitos
no
difficult
matter
books
in
the
patches
of
sermons
in
the
scotch
thistles
and
good
in
everything
light
and
darkness
aptest
of
metaphors
and
see
how
the
symbolism
permeates
our
language
from
the
loftiest
poetry
to
the
most
trifling
colloquialism
there
is
no
darkness
but
ignorance
says
the
pleasantest
of
stage
fools
in
which
thou
art
more
puzzled
than
the
egyptians
in
their
fog
and
what
millions
of
passably
brave
men
have
sympathised
with
ajax
in
his
prayer
not
for
courage
or
strength
he
had
those
already
not
for
victory
that
was
outside
the
province
of
his
interference
but
for
light
to
see
what
he
was
doing
no
obligatory
track
so
rugged
but
man
if
he
be
any
good
at
all
may
travel
it
with
reasonable
safety
in
a
glimmer
of
light
and
no
available
track
so
easy
but
man
however
capable
will
blunder
therein
if
he
walks
in
darkness
nay
the
more
resolute
and
conscientious
he
is
the
more
certainly
will
he
stub
his
big
toe
on
a
root
and
impale
his
open
unseeing
eye
on
a
dead
twig
and
tread
on
nothing
to
the
kinking
of
his
and
the
sudden
alarm
of
his
mind
and
light
which
ought
to
spread
with
precisely
the
rapidity
of
thought
is
tardy
enough
owing
solely
to
lack
of
receptivity
in
its
only
known
medium
namely
the
human
subject
but
and
here
is
the
fact
of
the
ages
light
is
inherently
dynamic
not
static
active
not
passive
aggressive
not
defensive
therefore
as
twice
one
is
two
the
momentum
of
light
having
overborne
the
conservatism
of
the
paleolithic
neolithic
and
other
unpronounceable
ages
has
in
this
century
produced
a
distinct
paling
of
the
stars
with
an
opaline
tint
in
the
east
and
as
a
penny
for
the
first
nail
twopence
for
the
second
fourpence
for
the
third
and
so
on
amounts
to
something
like
a
million
sterling
for
the
set
of
so
the
faint
suggestion
of
dawn
observable
in
our
day
can
not
do
otherwise
than
multiply
itself
into
sunshine
yet
meantime
happy
insect
is
he
whose
luminosity
dispels
a
modicum
of
the
general
darkness
besides
shedding
light
on
his
own
path
as
he
buzzes
along
in
philosophic
meditation
fancy
free
here
i
trod
on
something
about
as
thick
as
your
wrist
something
round
and
smooth
which
jerked
and
wriggled
as
my
weight
came
upon
it
i
rose
fully
three
feet
into
the
air
without
conscious
effort
and
thenceforth
pursued
my
difficult
way
with
a
subjective
discontent
which
i
fear
did
little
honour
to
my
philosophy
thinking
to
confess
the
truth
what
an
advantage
it
would
be
if
man
figuratively
a
mopoke
could
become
one
in
reality
when
all
the
advantage
lay
in
that
direction
also
feeling
prepared
to
wager
my
official
dignity
against
a
pair
of
that
longfellow
would
never
have
apostrophised
the
welcome
the
the
most
fair
the
night
if
he
had
known
what
it
was
to
work
his
passage
through
purgatory
in
a
state
of
paradise
nudity
with
the
incongruity
of
the
association
pressing
on
his
mind
ignorance
again
but
such
is
life
it
was
about
of
a
mile
from
the
edge
of
the
timber
to
the
fire
and
i
should
think
it
took
me
an
hour
to
perform
the
journey
it
was
a
deserted
fire
after
all
and
nearly
burnt
out
but
i
soon
raised
a
good
smoke
and
had
relief
from
the
mosquitos
the
passage
from
the
road
had
given
me
enough
of
exploring
for
the
time
so
i
parted
the
fire
into
three
lots
and
piling
bark
and
rubbish
on
each
lay
down
between
them
to
enjoy
a
good
rest
and
think
the
thing
over
thoroughly
it
may
surprise
the
inexperienced
reader
to
know
that
i
had
often
before
found
myself
in
a
similar
state
of
nature
and
in
far
more
prominent
situations
i
had
repeatedly
found
myself
doing
the
block
or
stalking
down
the
aisle
of
a
crowded
church
mid
nodings
on
and
had
wakened
up
to
find
the
unsubstantial
pageant
faded
and
my
own
conspicuousness
exchanged
for
a
happier
obscurity
so
throughout
the
trying
incidents
of
the
evening
i
have
recalled
the
hope
of
waking
up
had
never
been
entirely
absent
from
my
mind
and
now
as
i
lay
drowsing
with
pup
beside
me
and
not
a
mosquito
within
three
yards
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
i
did
get
out
of
the
difficulty
by
waking
up
i
would
get
out
of
it
some
other
way
philosophy
whispered
that
all
cares
were
not
only
wrong
but
unprofitable
though
i
had
inadvertently
switched
my
little
engine
on
to
the
wrong
line
when
i
postponed
my
intended
smoke
and
had
so
lost
the
clothes
which
evidently
went
so
far
toward
making
the
man
it
would
be
true
wisdom
to
accept
the
consequent
kismet
and
wait
till
the
clouds
rolled
by
the
end
of
the
section
could
be
far
ahead
sufficient
unto
the
day
and
i
dropped
asleep
here
the
record
properly
ends
i
have
faithfully
recounted
the
events
of
the
of
november
at
what
cost
to
my
own
sensibilities
none
but
myself
can
ever
know
but
the
one
foible
of
my
life
is
amiability
and
from
the
first
i
had
no
intention
of
breaking
off
abruptly
when
my
promise
was
fulfilled
leaving
the
reader
to
conclude
that
i
woke
up
at
my
camp
and
found
the
whole
thing
a
dream
the
dream
expedient
is
the
mere
romancist
transparent
shift
and
he
is
fortunate
in
always
having
one
at
command
though
transparency
should
of
course
be
avoided
the
vies
in
puerility
with
the
hero
rescue
of
the
heroine
from
deadly
peril
a
thing
that
has
actually
happened
about
twice
since
the
and
no
less
happily
extinct
helladotherium
disported
itself
on
the
future
site
of
eden
i
am
no
romancist
i
repudiate
shifts
and
stand
or
fall
by
the
naked
truth
therefore
though
legal
risk
here
takes
the
place
of
outraged
sensibility
i
shall
proceed
with
the
record
of
the
next
day
till
my
loco
reaches
the
end
of
the
current
section
by
this
order
of
another
herring
the
foolish
reader
will
be
instructed
the
integrity
of
narrative
preserved
and
the
linked
sacrifice
long
and
if
in
the
writing
of
annotations
yet
to
come
the
exigencies
of
annalism
should
demand
a
repetition
of
this
rather
important
favour
i
may
be
trusted
to
grant
it
without
fishing
for
compliments
or
in
any
way
reminding
the
recipient
of
his
moral
indebtedness
i
ca
say
anything
fairer
than
that
it
was
good
daylight
when
i
woke
a
little
chilled
and
smarting
but
otherwise
nothing
the
worse
let
me
endeavour
to
describe
the
scene
which
i
stealthily
but
carefully
surveyed
during
the
next
few
minutes
the
victorian
river
road
running
east
and
west
lay
about
of
a
mile
to
the
south
north
and
west
i
could
see
nothing
but
heavy
timber
and
undergrowth
the
eastern
prospect
was
more
interesting
within
twenty
yards
of
my
lair
a
long
deep
lagoon
lay
north
and
south
the
intervening
ground
being
covered
with
whipstick
scrub
beyond
the
lagoon
a
large
promontory
of
red
soil
partly
cultivated
and
partly
ringed
projected
northward
from
the
road
into
the
state
forest
beyond
this
still
eastward
the
river
timber
again
came
out
to
the
road
a
roomy
homestead
with
smoke
issuing
from
one
of
the
chimneys
stood
almost
opposite
my
point
of
observation
and
about
a
hundred
yards
distant
whilst
a
garden
occupied
the
space
between
the
house
and
the
lagoon
at
the
north
side
of
the
garden
the
lagoon
was
divided
by
a
dry
isthmus
the
nearer
boundary
fence
of
the
farm
in
whipstick
scrub
ran
north
and
south
along
the
edge
of
the
lagoon
the
lower
line
of
forming
part
of
it
and
a
gate
opposite
the
isthmus
afforded
egress
to
the
river
frontage
again
opposite
my
fire
but
considerably
to
the
right
a
deep
waterworn
drain
came
down
from
the
table
land
into
the
lagoon
and
between
this
drain
and
the
house
stood
a
little
old
worn
away
with
the
friction
of
cattle
to
the
similitude
of
a
monstrous
mushroom
the
stack
was
situated
close
to
the
drain
something
over
a
hundred
yards
from
the
house
and
about
the
same
distance
from
my
camp
the
paddock
intersected
by
the
drain
was
bare
fallow
that
is
land
ploughed
in
readiness
for
the
next
year
sowing
there
were
several
other
old
on
different
parts
of
the
farm
but
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
record
away
beyond
the
farm
two
or
three
miles
up
the
main
road
and
just
to
the
right
of
the
river
timber
i
recognised
the
f
arms
hotel
b
place
lay
beyond
and
to
the
right
but
shut
out
of
view
by
a
paddock
of
green
timber
the
sight
of
the
a
white
speck
in
the
distance
suggested
to
my
mind
an
expedient
which
however
i
had
to
dismiss
we
read
that
napoleon
bonaparte
on
the
eve
of
signing
his
first
abdication
walked
restlessly
about
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
muttering
if
i
only
had
a
hundred
thousand
men
similarly
as
i
contemplated
that
i
muttered
if
i
only
had
a
handful
of
corks
ay
if
my
prototype
wanted
the
men
to
abet
him
in
maintaining
his
imperial
dignity
whilst
i
wanted
the
corks
to
assist
me
in
an
enterprise
attempted
by
a
good
many
people
from
smerdis
to
perkin
warbeck
namely
the
personation
of
royalty
something
similar
you
see
even
apart
from
the
fact
that
neither
of
us
found
any
truth
in
touchstone
statement
that
there
is
much
virtue
in
an
nice
customs
curtsey
to
great
kings
jacky
xlviii
under
whose
mild
sway
i
have
spent
many
peaceful
years
wears
clothes
exactly
when
it
suits
his
comfort
when
his
royal
pleasure
is
to
emulate
the
lilies
of
the
field
he
simply
goes
that
way
thus
literally
excelling
solomon
in
all
his
glory
the
evolution
of
intelligence
has
stripped
him
of
every
other
prerogative
but
there
its
ends
and
his
own
begins
european
monarchs
will
do
well
to
paste
a
memorandum
of
this
inside
their
diadems
for
let
them
paint
an
inch
thick
to
this
favour
they
must
come
at
last
howevers
that
is
their
business
my
own
royal
master
can
still
do
no
wrong
in
arraying
himself
in
any
one
of
his
three
changes
of
attire
the
the
or
the
and
if
i
could
only
counterfeit
his
colour
for
a
few
hours
i
would
stalk
majestically
to
my
camp
caparisoned
in
the
regalia
and
protected
by
the
divinity
that
doth
hedge
a
king
but
i
had
no
corks
the
homestead
was
cheerful
with
voices
which
reached
my
ambush
clearly
though
unintelligibly
through
the
still
morning
air
at
last
i
saw
a
woman
advance
toward
the
edge
of
the
fallow
and
stand
for
a
minute
facing
the
direction
of
the
old
then
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
toward
the
house
and
called
out
can
any
of
you
see
jim
comin
with
that
horse
father
be
ready
in
a
minute
and
then
there
be
ructions
a
little
boy
climbed
the
garden
fence
and
stood
on
the
corner
post
not
comin
yet
mam
mam
went
back
to
the
house
and
the
boy
followed
her
here
was
my
opportunity
the
topography
of
the
place
was
so
perfectly
suited
to
the
simplest
plan
of
campaign
that
it
may
suggest
to
the
suspicious
reader
a
romancist
shift
diaphanous
as
the
woven
wind
of
dacca
let
me
repeat
then
that
such
a
flimsy
thing
is
entirely
out
of
my
line
and
would
have
been
so
even
at
that
time
availing
myself
of
the
abundant
cover
of
whipstick
scrub
i
made
my
way
down
to
the
lagoon
swam
silently
across
darted
along
the
drain
in
a
stooping
position
till
i
could
moon
the
house
with
the
old
stack
and
finally
took
my
post
in
a
convenient
recess
on
the
side
of
the
stack
farthest
from
the
house
sure
enough
there
was
a
across
the
fallow
and
a
culvert
on
the
drain
close
to
my
refuge
jim
would
soon
be
coming
down
that
track
toward
the
house
and
as
my
unhappy
condition
might
appear
more
compatible
with
the
nature
of
an
alien
than
of
a
britisher
i
would
accost
him
with
a
slight
foreign
accent
state
my
difficulty
and
ask
him
pour
de
dieu
to
bring
me
a
pair
of
his
my
name
would
be
frongswaw
bongjoor
i
sat
down
with
my
back
against
the
stack
to
recover
breath
for
already
jim
was
in
sight
approaching
at
an
easy
gallop
and
in
two
minutes
was
within
fifty
yards
then
hope
for
a
season
bade
the
world
farewell
and
a
cold
shiver
ran
down
my
spine
but
without
moving
from
my
niche
i
desperately
tore
down
handfuls
of
irish
feathers
from
the
overhanging
eave
to
form
a
sort
of
screen
for
jim
was
a
magnificent
young
woman
riding
barebacked
á
la
the
fine
contour
of
her
figure
displayed
with
an
amazonian
audacity
which
seemed
to
make
her
nearly
as
horrid
as
myself
my
brow
was
wet
with
honest
sweat
whilst
from
the
poor
concealment
already
described
i
watched
her
swing
the
horse
aside
from
the
culvert
and
send
him
at
the
drain
and
with
that
fascination
by
trifles
which
in
situations
like
mine
you
must
often
have
experienced
i
noticed
her
pliant
waist
spring
in
easy
undulation
to
the
horse
flying
leap
and
so
with
that
thick
cable
of
platted
hair
flapping
and
surging
down
her
back
she
vanished
from
the
scene
she
was
a
phantom
of
delight
when
first
she
gleamed
upon
my
sight
but
the
revulsion
of
feeling
was
one
of
the
quickest
and
fullest
i
ever
experienced
it
was
some
minutes
before
i
became
my
own
philosophic
self
again
then
i
crept
to
the
corner
of
the
stack
and
reconnoitred
the
homestead
near
the
jim
had
just
saddled
the
horse
and
with
the
near
flap
resting
on
her
head
was
taking
up
the
slack
of
the
girth
with
her
teeth
whilst
her
left
hand
grasping
the
rein
close
to
the
horse
mouth
prevented
the
animal
from
taking
a
piece
out
of
her
presently
dad
trotted
out
of
the
house
and
took
possession
of
the
horse
while
she
stepped
back
a
pace
then
she
seemed
to
say
something
of
great
pith
and
moment
for
dad
paused
evidently
questioning
her
at
last
he
returned
hastily
into
the
house
leaving
the
horse
again
in
her
charge
i
made
an
effort
to
concentrate
my
remnant
of
faith
on
a
double
event
namely
that
he
would
delay
long
and
that
he
would
come
my
way
when
he
started
he
at
least
was
a
man
and
a
brother
i
would
interview
him
as
he
passed
and
faith
scored
he
did
delay
long
and
he
came
my
way
straight
but
he
came
on
foot
and
he
came
with
a
gun
speaking
over
his
shoulder
to
jim
as
he
bustled
past
even
in
the
distance
i
fancied
her
attitude
was
that
of
a
girl
who
had
imprudently
set
in
motion
a
thing
that
she
was
powerless
to
stop
i
could
believe
in
the
reality
of
the
spectacle
but
the
illusion
was
there
palpable
enough
and
it
consisted
chiefly
of
a
man
hurrying
toward
the
stack
his
right
hand
on
the
lock
of
a
long
duck
gun
his
left
partly
along
the
barrel
and
the
cheek
of
the
stock
resting
against
his
hip
beyond
doubt
he
was
after
something
and
beyond
doubt
he
meant
mischief
i
glanced
behind
me
and
round
the
expanse
of
bare
fallow
but
there
was
even
a
magpie
in
sight
at
the
same
time
the
sportsman
general
bearing
his
depressed
head
and
downward
vigilance
showed
that
he
was
stalking
ground
game
and
was
interested
in
anything
perched
on
the
stack
this
was
apparent
to
me
by
the
time
he
had
got
within
thirty
or
forty
yards
and
was
holding
the
gun
ready
to
clap
to
his
shoulder
also
i
noticed
that
several
other
women
had
joined
jim
and
were
watching
his
progress
having
now
approached
within
range
he
deployed
to
the
left
in
order
to
outflank
whatever
he
was
after
of
course
you
would
have
rushed
him
you
would
have
wrenched
the
gun
from
his
grasp
and
broken
it
across
your
knee
you
would
have
despoiled
him
of
his
and
cuffed
him
home
with
ignominy
yes
i
know
so
would
i
what
i
actually
did
however
was
to
make
two
springs
which
landed
me
in
the
bottom
of
the
drain
i
called
to
mind
that
less
than
down
to
the
lagoon
i
had
noticed
a
deep
narrow
miniature
ravine
eaten
into
one
side
of
the
drain
by
a
tributary
channel
and
well
sheltered
by
the
foliage
of
large
docks
now
run
up
to
seed
in
thirty
seconds
i
was
rustling
into
this
friendly
cover
there
my
confidence
speedily
returned
and
raising
my
head
among
the
seeding
stems
i
noted
the
guerilla
tactics
of
that
white
savage
still
holding
his
weapon
at
the
ready
he
had
circled
round
the
stack
till
his
view
commanded
all
its
recesses
then
he
looked
up
and
down
the
drain
peered
under
the
culvert
and
cast
his
eye
across
the
fallow
in
every
direction
apparently
satisfied
he
threw
the
gun
on
his
shoulder
and
started
off
toward
the
lower
end
of
the
garden
i
saw
him
disappear
in
the
whipstick
scrub
between
the
garden
and
the
lagoon
then
i
backed
out
into
the
drain
but
i
could
gain
nothing
by
staying
there
and
just
as
little
by
going
back
to
my
camp
whereas
from
the
stack
i
could
see
any
advantage
that
might
offer
itself
either
about
the
house
or
across
the
lagoon
and
logically
the
stack
ought
now
to
be
one
of
the
safest
places
in
the
province
so
i
returned
to
my
old
post
and
almost
hopelessly
brought
one
eye
to
bear
on
the
homestead
i
was
just
in
time
to
catch
occasional
glimpses
of
dad
head
above
the
foliage
of
the
fruit
trees
as
he
rode
down
along
the
farther
side
of
the
garden
to
the
dry
crossing
in
the
lagoon
and
presently
i
saw
him
go
up
the
opposite
bank
and
disappear
in
the
scrub
another
instance
of
erratic
shunting
on
my
part
if
i
had
stayed
at
my
camp
i
might
have
accosted
him
on
neutral
ground
without
his
gun
and
with
his
mind
unpoisoned
by
any
of
jim
hysterical
imaginings
what
on
earth
had
she
told
him
about
me
she
had
certainly
told
him
something
just
at
this
moment
the
sun
which
had
risen
behind
a
dense
bank
of
clouds
suddenly
burst
forth
the
colourless
monotony
of
the
scene
flashed
into
loveliness
under
the
magic
pencils
of
golden
light
and
against
the
sombre
background
of
river
timber
a
pair
of
white
hanging
with
other
drapery
on
a
line
between
the
house
and
garden
leaped
out
in
ravishing
a
lifelong
education
directing
the
inherent
loyalty
of
human
nature
invests
anything
in
the
shape
of
national
or
associational
bunting
with
a
sacredness
difficult
to
express
in
words
loyalty
to
something
is
an
ingredient
in
our
moral
constitution
and
the
more
vague
the
object
the
more
rabid
will
be
our
devotion
to
the
symbol
any
badge
is
good
enough
to
adore
provided
the
worshipper
has
in
some
way
identified
the
fetish
with
himself
anything
from
the
standard
of
george
to
the
forky
pennon
of
lord
marmion
from
the
banner
to
the
three
legs
of
the
isle
of
man
now
with
insignia
as
with
everything
else
it
is
deprivation
only
that
gives
a
true
sense
of
value
and
speaking
from
experience
i
maintain
that
even
the
british
flag
which
covers
fabulous
millions
of
our
dwindles
into
parochial
insignificance
beside
that
forky
pennon
on
the
farmer
which
latter
covers
in
a
far
more
essential
manner
of
civilised
humanity
rightly
viewed
i
say
that
ensign
is
the
proudest
gonfalon
ever
kissed
by
wanton
zephyrs
whoop
vive
les
thou
sun
shine
on
them
joyously
ye
breezes
waft
them
wide
our
glorious
semper
eadem
the
banner
of
our
pride
there
was
no
time
to
lose
the
bifurcated
banner
might
be
taken
into
the
house
at
any
moment
in
the
meantime
several
women
were
unwittingly
maintaining
a
sort
of
guard
over
their
alien
flag
the
to
him
who
can
wear
them
thought
i
must
give
this
garrison
an
alerte
though
i
should
have
to
sacrifice
the
old
is
dangerous
when
the
baser
nature
comes
between
the
pass
and
fell
incensed
points
of
mighty
opposites
the
old
is
the
baser
nature
the
mighty
opposites
are
the
and
myself
few
men
i
think
have
a
healthier
hatred
of
incendiarism
than
i
have
this
hatred
dates
from
my
eleventh
year
or
thereabout
when
i
was
strongly
impressed
by
a
which
cleaned
the
grass
off
half
the
county
the
origin
of
that
fire
still
remains
a
mystery
though
all
manner
of
investigation
was
made
at
the
time
one
of
the
most
dilligent
inquirers
being
a
boy
of
ten
or
twelve
who
used
to
lie
awake
half
the
night
wondering
what
could
be
done
to
a
person
for
trying
to
smoke
a
bandicoot
out
of
a
hollow
log
without
thinking
of
the
dead
grass
but
now
it
was
a
choice
between
the
old
and
my
citizenship
and
the
former
had
to
go
i
am
aware
of
course
that
the
law
takes
no
cognisance
of
dilemmas
like
mine
and
has
no
manly
scruple
against
raking
up
old
grievances
that
would
be
better
forgotten
but
as
i
said
before
come
on
with
your
clue
embittered
though
i
was
by
abraham
idea
of
hospitality
i
still
felt
some
lingering
scruple
as
my
order
of
battle
unfolded
itself
in
detail
every
great
operation
as
well
as
every
small
or
one
consists
of
details
as
a
circle
consists
of
degrees
and
the
person
responsible
for
the
grand
enterprise
must
unavoidably
be
responsible
for
its
most
uninviting
detail
the
details
of
a
for
instance
are
revolting
enough
and
here
you
must
judge
not
according
to
the
appearance
but
judge
righteous
judgment
you
must
perceive
that
the
white
hands
of
the
judge
are
the
hands
which
reeve
the
noose
which
adjust
the
same
round
the
neck
of
the
man
or
woman
which
pull
down
the
which
manipulate
the
lever
and
which
if
necessary
grip
the
other
person
ankles
and
hang
on
till
he
is
and
the
lord
has
mercy
on
his
soul
it
is
as
unreasonable
to
despise
de
melbourne
or
de
sydney
for
his
little
share
in
a
scragging
operation
as
it
would
be
to
heap
contumely
on
comp
or
devil
because
of
this
somewhat
offensive
paragraph
having
in
the
present
instance
no
subordinate
to
carry
out
my
details
i
realised
their
unpleasantness
even
whilst
speciously
justifying
the
enterprise
as
a
whole
further
provocation
was
required
to
overcome
my
aversion
to
the
dirty
work
and
this
provocation
was
forthcoming
in
ample
measure
i
had
withdrawn
from
the
corner
of
the
stack
into
my
nook
to
lay
a
few
plans
and
to
hastily
review
the
ethics
of
the
matter
now
i
crept
back
to
feast
my
eyes
once
more
on
the
before
making
my
but
another
object
met
my
sight
first
and
i
nearly
fainted
when
i
recovered
myself
a
few
minutes
later
i
was
in
the
lagoon
i
dare
swim
across
for
i
would
have
been
in
full
view
from
the
stack
a
cluster
of
leafy
reeds
growing
in
two
feet
of
water
and
the
same
depth
of
slimy
mud
was
the
nearest
cover
and
in
the
midst
of
this
i
cowered
hardening
my
heart
against
society
and
watching
jim
herself
as
she
tripped
blithely
past
the
end
of
the
stack
and
looked
into
my
recess
it
seemed
incredible
and
yet
in
spite
of
the
cold
and
misery
and
difficulty
of
the
situation
i
could
wake
up
to
find
myself
in
my
i
always
make
a
point
of
believing
the
best
where
women
are
concerned
and
i
had
been
prepossessed
in
jim
favour
yet
it
now
seemed
to
me
that
if
she
had
been
worthy
of
her
high
calling
she
would
have
brought
that
pair
of
white
off
the
line
with
perhaps
a
supplementary
garment
or
so
and
modestly
left
them
in
the
drain
instead
of
thus
seeking
further
occasion
against
me
she
looked
under
the
culvert
across
the
paddock
and
toward
the
lagoon
as
abraham
had
done
then
walked
round
the
stack
and
finally
returned
home
by
the
lower
end
of
the
garden
even
pausing
to
look
over
the
picket
fence
and
scanning
right
and
left
as
she
entered
the
whipstick
scrub
enough
and
to
spare
thought
i
these
barbarians
have
given
me
the
sign
of
their
order
now
let
me
respond
with
the
countersign
not
without
practical
protest
shall
i
die
a
nude
fugitive
on
their
premises
and
not
if
i
can
help
it
shall
the
people
find
the
word
written
on
my
heart
the
intervening
garden
and
whipstick
scrub
effectually
concealed
my
movements
from
the
enemy
as
i
recrossed
the
lagoon
and
made
my
way
with
all
speed
to
the
unfurnished
lodgings
i
had
occupied
on
the
preceding
night
there
i
selected
a
piece
of
thick
bark
about
the
size
of
your
open
hand
and
solid
fire
for
half
its
length
i
swam
the
lagoon
with
this
in
my
teeth
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
had
buried
it
in
the
broken
straw
at
the
base
of
the
stack
then
i
returned
along
the
drain
but
instead
of
crossing
the
lagoon
sneaked
through
the
thick
fringe
of
whipstick
scrub
to
the
lower
end
of
the
garden
and
there
waited
for
something
to
happen
i
had
to
wait
a
good
while
the
old
was
in
sight
from
my
post
and
i
began
to
think
i
should
have
to
get
another
piece
of
bark
when
i
heard
a
youngster
voice
squeak
out
oo
mam
th
ole
then
followed
sundry
little
yelps
of
surprise
from
the
women
and
after
giving
them
a
start
of
a
minute
or
two
i
went
loping
round
the
side
of
the
garden
and
into
the
back
yard
before
the
vanguard
reached
the
stack
i
had
captured
the
flag
that
braved
a
thousand
years
and
applied
it
to
its
proper
use
i
also
made
free
with
another
banner
which
i
tucked
into
the
former
i
was
like
the
man
who
wrapped
his
colours
round
his
breast
on
a
field
of
spain
glancing
into
the
combined
kitchen
and
i
saw
a
row
of
wooden
pegs
along
the
wall
with
several
coats
and
hats
hanging
thereon
i
appropriated
only
an
old
shaped
like
a
even
to
the
aperture
at
the
top
and
from
three
pairs
of
boots
under
the
sofa
i
chose
the
shabbiest
astonished
like
clive
at
my
own
moderation
i
next
rummaged
all
the
most
likely
places
in
search
of
a
pipe
and
tobacco
but
without
avail
i
even
extended
my
researches
into
the
pantry
and
thence
into
the
sacred
precincts
of
the
front
parlour
but
the
raged
equally
everywhere
the
place
was
a
residence
but
by
no
stretch
of
hyperbole
could
you
call
it
a
home
the
side
window
of
the
parlour
looked
toward
the
conflagration
and
there
i
counted
four
women
one
girl
and
a
little
boy
three
of
the
women
to
judge
by
their
gestures
were
laughing
and
joking
whilst
the
fourth
and
most
matronly
was
talking
to
the
others
over
her
shoulder
as
she
turned
her
steps
toward
the
house
then
i
bethought
myself
of
dugald
dalgetty
excellent
rule
respecting
the
provant
and
the
kitchen
early
though
it
was
the
had
been
cleared
away
so
i
took
the
lid
off
the
boiler
under
the
safe
in
search
of
the
cake
which
ought
to
be
kept
there
but
the
house
was
afflicted
with
too
however
having
no
time
to
and
being
constitutionally
anything
but
an
epicure
i
just
helped
myself
to
the
major
part
of
a
dipper
of
milk
which
stood
on
the
dresser
then
secured
a
scone
and
a
generous
section
of
excellent
potted
head
from
the
safe
eating
these
out
of
my
hand
i
departed
without
ostentation
reflecting
that
it
was
better
to
be
at
the
latter
end
of
a
feast
than
the
beginning
of
a
quarrel
and
pervaded
by
a
spirit
of
thankfulness
which
can
be
conceived
only
by
those
who
have
undergone
similar
tribulation
and
experienced
similar
relief
relief
did
i
say
the
word
is
much
too
light
for
the
bore
of
the
matter
there
is
a
story
bearing
the
unmistakable
earmark
of
a
lie
and
evidently
not
a
translation
from
any
other
language
to
the
effect
that
once
a
british
subject
in
a
foreign
land
was
taken
out
to
be
shot
just
for
being
too
good
pinioned
and
blindfold
he
stood
with
folded
arms
looking
with
haughty
unconcern
down
twelve
all
in
radial
alignment
on
his
heart
of
oak
twelve
foreign
eyes
were
drawing
beads
on
the
dauntless
captive
and
twelve
foreign
fingers
were
pressing
with
increasing
force
on
the
triggers
when
a
majestic
form
appeared
on
the
scene
and
with
the
motion
of
a
woman
launching
a
quilt
across
a
wide
bed
the
british
consul
draped
the
prisoner
from
head
to
foot
in
the
union
jack
that
all
the
purpose
of
the
lie
is
to
convey
the
impression
that
it
is
a
grand
thing
to
be
covered
by
the
flag
of
britain
but
give
me
the
forky
pennon
before
referred
to
and
keep
your
union
jack
cardinal
wolsey
you
may
remember
as
a
consequence
of
putting
his
trust
in
princes
found
himself
at
last
so
badly
treed
that
his
robe
and
his
integrity
to
heaven
were
all
he
dared
now
call
his
own
the
effect
was
a
peace
above
all
earthly
dignities
so
with
me
but
in
larger
beatitude
having
my
and
my
integrity
to
heaven
i
found
myself
overflowing
with
the
sunny
of
the
man
that
struck
buckley
and
before
you
join
the
against
the
barbarous
incendiary
of
the
express
just
put
yourself
in
my
place
and
you
wo
fail
to
realise
what
a
profitable
transaction
it
was
to
get
a
puris
naturalibus
lunatic
clothed
and
in
his
right
mind
by
the
sacrifice
of
a
mere
eyesore
on
a
farm
the
old
was
worth
eighteen
pence
but
i
would
gladly
have
purchased
its
destruction
with
as
many
pounds
to
be
paid
say
in
nine
monthly
instalments
to
be
sure
it
did
belong
to
me
but
then
neither
did
the
splitters
bark
so
there
you
are
crossing
the
dry
place
in
the
lagoon
i
dived
into
the
whipstick
scrub
and
turned
northward
intending
to
get
across
the
river
as
soon
as
possible
and
follow
up
the
new
south
wales
side
to
my
camp
i
should
have
been
well
not
exactly
happy
having
taken
degrees
in
philosophy
which
place
me
above
a
state
fit
only
for
girls
i
should
have
been
without
a
ripple
on
my
mirrored
surface
but
i
was
serenely
sufficient
as
i
felt
and
fit
for
anything
some
ingredient
seemed
lacking
in
my
goblet
there
was
a
vacant
chair
somewhere
in
my
microcosm
i
knew
i
was
forgetting
something
but
how
could
that
be
when
in
the
most
restricted
sense
of
the
word
i
had
nothing
to
forget
thus
musing
i
had
gone
through
half
my
provant
now
i
turned
round
to
give
the
rest
to
ah
where
was
pup
i
knew
he
had
followed
me
on
my
first
journey
up
the
drain
but
i
had
seen
him
since
and
had
been
too
busy
to
notice
his
absence
he
would
probably
be
at
the
farmhouse
i
must
get
my
clothes
changed
and
look
after
him
it
was
about
a
mile
and
a
half
northward
to
the
river
before
reaching
it
i
saw
crossing
the
flat
in
the
direction
of
the
victorian
river
road
a
swagman
whom
i
recognised
in
the
distance
as
my
friend
andy
in
casual
surprise
for
as
you
may
remember
i
had
last
seen
him
on
the
new
south
wales
side
eight
or
ten
miles
away
and
going
in
the
opposite
direction
i
went
on
without
exchange
of
greeting
shortly
afterwards
i
came
plump
upon
abraham
sitting
on
his
horse
and
talking
to
a
young
fellow
with
an
axe
on
his
shoulder
i
respectfully
swerved
aside
not
wishing
in
this
particular
case
to
come
under
the
provisions
of
that
unsound
rule
which
judges
a
man
by
the
clothes
he
wears
presently
i
became
aware
of
the
jingle
of
a
and
the
smoke
of
a
and
close
to
the
river
i
found
a
tilted
near
which
an
elderly
man
with
tattooed
arms
sat
on
a
log
enjoying
his
smoke
now
if
i
had
only
known
this
a
couple
of
hours
earlier
after
the
usual
civilities
i
reinforced
my
provant
by
a
pannikin
of
tea
some
fried
fish
and
a
slice
off
the
edge
of
a
damper
which
rivalled
the
nether
millstone
in
more
than
one
respect
thus
assuring
myself
that
i
had
attained
carlyle
definition
of
a
man
an
omnivorous
biped
that
wears
meanwhile
in
response
to
my
host
invitation
to
tell
him
what
i
was
lagged
for
i
explained
that
i
was
travelling
my
horses
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
i
had
come
across
to
see
a
friend
had
been
bushed
all
night
and
wanted
to
get
back
he
could
manage
the
river
for
me
he
said
he
followed
fishing
and
for
a
living
but
there
was
so
many
informers
about
these
times
that
a
man
had
to
keep
his
open
if
he
wanted
to
use
a
net
or
a
people
need
be
so
particular
for
there
was
ole
q
had
been
warning
and
threatening
him
yesterday
and
here
was
the
two
young
q
s
out
this
morning
at
the
skreek
of
daylight
falling
spars
to
build
a
big
shed
and
the
ole
man
out
on
horseback
picking
the
best
saplings
on
the
river
ole
q
was
a
his
place
was
just
across
the
flat
with
a
garden
reaching
down
to
the
lagoon
q
himself
was
the
two
ends
and
the
bight
of
a
sanguinary
dog
after
breakfast
the
old
fellow
furnished
me
with
and
paddled
me
across
the
river
during
the
passage
for
want
of
something
else
to
say
i
mentioned
to
him
that
i
had
seen
andy
crossing
the
flat
apparently
from
his
camp
he
explained
that
the
swagman
had
been
on
his
way
to
a
new
the
day
before
but
had
met
one
of
the
owners
who
told
him
the
mill
would
start
till
after
harvest
and
promised
him
work
on
the
farm
in
the
meantime
so
andy
on
his
return
journey
had
seen
the
outlaw
fire
in
the
dusk
and
after
some
conversation
across
the
river
the
latter
had
ferried
him
over
and
entertained
him
for
the
night
i
mention
this
merely
to
show
with
what
waste
of
energy
the
sundowner
often
hunts
for
work
particularly
if
he
happens
to
be
the
victim
of
any
physical
infirmity
on
reaching
the
north
bank
i
reminded
the
old
fellow
that
i
wanted
to
return
to
look
after
a
dog
i
had
lost
when
i
was
bushed
and
he
promised
to
bring
his
skiff
for
me
when
i
would
in
a
couple
of
hours
i
was
at
my
camp
in
another
fifteen
minutes
i
was
arrayed
in
my
best
and
only
shortly
afterward
my
horses
were
equipped
and
cleopatra
being
in
fine
trim
was
bucking
furiously
in
the
where
i
had
mounted
in
an
hour
and
a
half
more
i
had
unsaddled
and
hobbled
both
horses
on
a
patch
of
good
grass
nearly
opposite
where
the
stood
my
persecuted
acquaintance
in
response
to
my
appeared
with
his
skiff
and
ferried
me
over
then
i
hurried
across
the
flat
to
the
residence
of
q
a
man
loses
no
time
when
such
a
dog
as
pup
is
at
stake
it
could
have
been
later
than
when
i
walked
up
along
the
garden
fence
and
approached
the
door
of
the
kitchen
a
and
singularly
handsome
girl
had
just
filled
a
bucket
of
water
at
the
and
was
hammering
the
peg
into
the
barrel
with
an
old
i
recognised
her
as
jim
and
forgave
her
on
sight
good
day
to
you
said
i
affably
sultry
weather
is
it
i
looking
for
a
big
blue
kangaroo
dog
with
a
red
leather
collar
answers
to
the
name
of
she
hesitated
a
moment
you
better
see
my
father
he
at
dinner
will
you
come
this
way
please
i
followed
her
into
the
parlour
in
passing
through
the
kitchen
i
noticed
that
dinner
was
over
and
a
second
young
woman
apparently
the
original
owner
of
my
boots
was
disposing
the
crockery
on
the
dresser
in
the
parlour
q
a
man
of
overpowering
dignity
redolent
of
the
bench
and
as
i
think
his
age
some
fifty
or
lady
inclining
to
threescore
was
dining
in
solitary
grandeur
waited
on
by
young
woman
number
three
lucullus
was
dining
with
lucullus

i
with
a
respectful
salaam

the
honour
of
addressing
mr

he
replied
surveying
me
from
head
to
foot
i
looking
for

night
or
this
morning
a
big
blue
kangaroo
dog
with
a
are

perfectly
sure
mr
q
how
did
you
come
in
possession
of
him
i
bought
him
eight
months

i
right
in
assuming
that
he
on
your
prem
steady
my
good
man
who
are
you

your
name
i
must
apologise
for
not
having
given
my
name
at
first
my
name
is
collins
of
the
new
south
wales
civil
service
i
and
what
leads
you
to
imply
that
i
got
your
dog
information
received
leave
the
apartment
naomi
said
the
magistrate
loftily
now
collins
he
continued
pouring
out
a
glass
of
wine
and
holding
it
between
his
eye
and
the
light
i
want
to
ask
you
he
drank
half
the
wine
set
the
glass
on
the
table
and
leisurely
wiped
his
mouth
with
his
serviette
i
want
to
ask
you
he
paused
again
pursed
his
lips
and
placed
his
forefinger
against
his
temple
i
want
to
ask
you
how
you
come
to
imply
that
the
dog
is
here
received
was
your
statement
be
precise
this
time
collins
i
waiting
for
your
answer
i
had
my
information
from
a
man
who
saw
the
dog
on
your
premises
mr
q
very
good
indeed
at
what
time
did
he
see
the
dog
be
punctual
collins
punctuality
implies
truth
about
sunrise
i
think
you
think
are
you
sure
well
yes
i
sure
describe
your
informer
please
describe
him
if
i
described
him
ever
so
accurately
you
would
know
him
from
adam
i
replied
sharply
and
withal
truthfully
is
my
dog
here
q
if
he
is
i
take
him
and
go
i
do
want
to
be
trying
your
patience
after
this
fashion
steady
connell
was
your
informer
a
man
about
my
height
i
have
no
idea
of
your
height
mr
q
was
he
a
man
about
your
own
height
we
get
at
it
presently
you
got
at
it
first
try
i
should
say
you
struck
his
height
to
about
a
sixteenth
of
an
inch
sunburnt
face
skulking
fugitive
appearance
generally
your
description
wonderfully
correct
q
you
might
without
libel
call
him
a
sansculotte
i
seldom
far
out
in
these
matters
how
was
he
dressed
in
a
little
brief
authority
so
far
as
i
remember
but
is
my
dog
do
you
imply
a
sarcasm
inquired
the
j
p
darkly
i
would
do
so
if
i
was
you
i
not
thinking
about
your
dog
you
and
your
dog
i
thinking
about
a
valuable
stack
of
hay
i
had
burnt
this
morning
and
you
give
me
a
clue
to
the
incendiary
he
paused
to
let
his
words
filter
in
you
done
it
without
your
knowledge
he
continued
pompously
again
holding
up
his
glass
to
the
light
in
the
silence
that
ensued
i
could
hear
the
murmur
of
the
girls
voices
about
the
house
and
the
irregular
ticking
of
two
clocks
while
there
dawned
on
my
mind
an
impression
that
somebody
had
fallen
in
the
fat
i
sorry
to
hear
of
your
loss
q
i
remarked
at
length
so
far
as
the
loss
goes
that
gives
me
no
inconvenience
though
it
might
break
a
poorer
man
i
been
burnt
out
r
p
and
stump
by
an
incendiary
when
i
was
at
ballarat
ah
said
i
sympathetically
but
my
sympathy
was
with
the
other
party
and
then
i
could
afford
to
offer
a
hundred
notes
for
the
apprehension
of
the
offender
before
the
ashes
was
cold
but
might
this
last
affair
be
an
accident
q
a
horse
treading
on
a
match
for
instance
i
think
you
ought
to
make
strict
inquiries
as
to
whether
any
horse
or
cow
or
anything
passed
by
the
stack
shortly
before
the
fire
was
noticed
i
know
my
own
business
he
replied
severely
i
been
the
instigation
of
bringing
more
offenders
and
vagabonds
and
that
class
of
people
to
justice
than
anybody
else
in
this
district
if
i
my
way
i
stamp
out
the
lawless
elements
of
society
i
admire
your
principles
q
and
you
may
count
upon
my
assistance
in
this
matter
there
are
two
illicit
down
here
i
was
talking
to
you
about
this
affair
interposed
the
beak
i
annoyed
over
it
i
been
on
the
wrong
lay
so
to
speak
all
this
morning
but
that
never
lasts
long
with
me
i
got
the
perpetrator
in
my
eye
now
in
his
naked
guilt
and
take
my
word
for
it
connor
i
bring
him
to
book
i
make
an
example
of
him
i
make
him
smoke
for
it
it
was
an
open
question
this
forenoon
but
to
show
how
circumstantial
evidence
sort
of
hems
in
a
suspected
party
why
here
i
can
lay
my
hand
on
the
very
man
and
what
more
he
ca
get
out
of
it
i
can
point
out
the
very
mark
of
his
body
where
he
slep
at
a
fire
among
the
whipstick
scrub
just
across
that
lagoon
and
a
party
i
acquainted
with
seen
him
yesterday
afternoon
some
distance
up
the
river
on
the
other
side
and
i
seen
him
this
morning
crossing
the
flat
here
more
or
less
about
the
time
the
fire
was
noticed
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
circumstantial
evidence
connelly
and
in
addition
to
this
i
can
point
out
his
incentive
which
i
prefer
to
hold
in
reserve
for
the
present
he
might
think
his
incentive
justifiable
but
the
bench
might
differ
with
him
and
el
corregidor
held
me
with
his
glittering
eye
while
he
sipped
his
wine
i
beg
your
pardon
q
said
i
clearing
my
throat
i
ca
help
taking
a
certain
interest
in
this
matter
would
it
be
impertinent
in
me
to
ask
who
the
person
was
that
saw
the
suspected
incendiary
up
the
river
on
yesterday
afternoon
i
no
objection
to
answer
your
question
conway
i
quite
expect
you
to
take
a
strong
interest
in
the
matter
in
fact
i
require
to
know
something
of
your
whereabouts
after
you
leave
my
premises
i
think
you
be
wanted
over
this
affair
the
party
that
seen
the
incendiary
yesterday
was
h
of
h
brothers
charles
h
i
inquired
casually
no
arthur
h
very
respectable
man
having
personal
knowledge
of
the
incendiary
again
the
sipped
his
wine
and
the
girls
voices
murmured
and
the
clocks
ticked
and
the
hens
clucked
in
the
yard
also
the
magpies
tootled
beyond
the
lagoon
and
a
couple
of
axes
sounded
faintly
across
the
flat
and
i
even
heard
through
the
open
window
the
noise
of
some
old
chattering
through
a
crop
of
hay
on
an
adjacent
farm
give
me
your
address
continued
mephistopheles
replenishing
his
glass
on
the
side
table
i
wrote
my
name
and
official
title
giving
our
departmental
office
in
sydney
as
a
fine
loose
postal
address
and
laid
the
paper
on
the
table
beside
the
magnate
it
reminded
me
of
old
times
when
my
dad
used
to
send
me
to
bring
him
the
strap
it
was
time
to
shake
my
faculties
together
for
had
alpine
son
such
need
i
made
a
study
of
law
myself
q
i
remarked
thoughtfully
this
was
perfectly
true
though
in
the
urgency
of
the
moment
i
omitted
to
add
that
my
researches
had
been
confined
to
those
interesting
laws
which
govern
the
manifold
operations
of
nature
i
made
a
special
study
of
law
and
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
a
successful
criminal
prosecution
is
a
pyrrhic
victory
at
best
at
worst
that
is
if
you
fail
to
prove
your
case
and
mind
you
it
no
easy
matter
to
prove
a
case
against
a
man
by
circumstantial
evidence
alone
if
you
fail
to
prove
your
case
then
it
his
turn
for
malicious
prosecution
and
you
ca
expect
any
mercy
from
him
when
you
think
your
case
is
complete
you
find
the
little
hitch
the
little
legal
point
that
your
opponent
has
been
holding
in
reserve
now
you
a
gentleman
of
substance
q
a
perfect
target
for
a
man
that
has
studied
law
i
paused
for
i
noticed
the
moor
already
changing
with
my
poison
by
heaven
i
like
to
have
a
shot
at
you
for
a
thousand
i
continued
eyeing
him
greedily
one
of
the
obstacles
in
a
position
like
mine
is
the
thing
you
just
implied
connellan
responded
the
waywode
almost
deferentially
same
time
this
case
ought
to
be
followed
up
for
the
sake
of
the
public
weal
as
valuable
as
the
stack
was
i
do
give
that
for
it
and
he
snapped
his
finger
and
thumb
you
may
be
morally
certain
of
the
identity
of
the
scoundrel
but
your
proofs
require
to
be
legally
impregnable
i
continued
pressing
home
where
he
had
disclosed
weakness
of
guard
i
know
a
very
respectable
man
a
johnson
who
dropped
something
over
a
thousand
in
a
case
similar
to
this
the
scoundrel
was
a
deep
subject
and
he
got
at
johnson
for
false
imprisonment
these
roving
characters
can
always
get
up
an
alibi
if
they
clever
excuse
my
meddling
in
this
case
q
but
you
interested
me
strongly
you
have
evidence
that
this
suspected
incendiary
was
seen
somewhere
down
the
river
yesterday
or
up
the
river
was
it
and
you
saw
him
somewhere
here
this
morning
very
well
would
the
two
descriptions
of
dress
and
deportment
tally
exactly
with
each
other
and
with
the
appearance
of
the
person
whom
independently
of
that
evidence
you
know
to
be
the
perpetrator
i
mean
the
scoundrel
of
the
consider
the
opening
for
an
alibi
there
you
hold
the
incentive
in
reserve
i
think
you
said
pardon
me
is
it
a
sufficient
one
it
do
take
much
incentive
to
be
sufficient
for
a

replied
the

suddenly
true
i
conceded
but

machiavelli
what
profit
would
it
be
to
such
a
scoundrel
to
do
you
an
injury
mr
q
the

classes
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
thriftless
classes
he
remarked
with
but
incendiarism
q
i
urged
in
modest
protest
why
the
whole
country
lives
by
the
farmer
and
i
sure
we
wo
argy
the
matter
collingwood
replied
my
antagonist
lowering
his
point
possibly
i
wo
trouble
you
any
further
over
this
affair
your
business
keeps
you
on
the
move
he
continued
looking
at
the
paper
beside
him
and
it
might
be
difficult
to
effect
service
you
want
your
dog
go
into
the
kitchen
inquire
for
miss
jemima
and
tell
her
i
authorise
her
to
give
you
the
dog
and
a
very
fine
dog
he
is
thank
you
q
good
day
good
day
replied
the
boyard
acknowledging
my
obeisance
by
a
wave
of
his
hand
it
was
a
near
thing
but
i
had
scored
after
all
you
ca
beat
the
passing
through
the
kitchen
i
met
the
graceful
jim
are
you
miss
jemima
i
asked
in
the
tone
you
should
always
use
towards
women
a
dimple
stole
into
each
beautiful
cheek
as
she
nodded
assent
well
q
authorises
miss
jemima
to
give
me
the
come
this
way
then
please
there
was
a
slight
flush
of
vexation
on
the
girl
face
now
and
indeed
it
was
scarcely
fair
of
dogberry
when
his
own
soft
thing
had
fallen
through
to
make
jim
cover
his
dignified
retreat
with
deepening
colour
she
led
the
way
to
the
stable
and
opened
a
disclosing
pup
crouched
with
a
large
bone
between
his
paws
the
red
collar
was
gone
and
he
was
chained
to
the
manger
by
a
of
course
i
did
blame
the
franklin
nor
do
i
blame
him
now
rather
the
reverse
there
seems
something
touching
and
beautiful
in
the
thought
that
respectability
at
best
is
merely
poised
never
hard
home
and
that
our
clay
will
assert
itself
when
a
dog
like
pup
throws
himself
into
the
other
scale
but
i
could
feel
the
vicarious
crimson
spreading
over
jim
forehead
and
ears
as
i
unbuckled
the
whilst
vainly
ransacking
my
mind
for
some
expression
of
thanks
that
would
sound
ironical
a
terrible
tie
of
sympathetic
estrangement
bound
this
sweet
scapegoat
and
me
asunder
or
divided
us
together
and
each
felt
that
salvation
awaited
the
one
who
spoke
first
and
to
the
point
or
rather
from
the
point
all
honour
to
jim
she
paced
you
call
him
observed
the
girl
girlishly
he
a
big
pup
his
proper
name
is
eton
boy
replied
the
wretch
wretchedly
and
neither
of
us
could
see
anything
in
the
other
remark
but
the
tension
was
relaxed
and
leaving
the
stable
together
we
gravely
agreed
that
a
thunderstorm
seemed
to
be
hanging
about
still
a
new
embarrassment
was
growing
in
the
girl
face
and
voice
even
in
the
uneasy
movement
of
her
hands
at
last
it
broke
out
i
you
have
had
any
dinner
do
let
that
trouble
you
miss
q
father
not
himself
today
she
continued
hastily
he
blames
us
for
burning
an
old
and
i
sure
we
never
done
it
mother
been
at
him
to
burn
it
out
of
the
way
this
years
back
for
it
was
right
between
the
house
and
the
road
and
it
was
straw
rotten
with
rust
but
i
glad
we
did
take
on
us
to
burn
it
for
father
vowing
vengeance
on
whoever
done
it
and
he
awful
at
finding
out
things
q
mentioned
it
to
me
i
replied
with
polite
interest
but
do
you
think
it
seems
a
most
unlikely
thing
for
a
stranger
to
do
perhaps
some
of
your
own
horses
or
cattle
trod
on
a
match
that
q
had
accidentally
dropped
there
himself
that
could
be
for
father
never
allows
any
matches
about
the
place
only
them
safety
ones
that
strikes
on
the
box
and
he
hates
smoking
my
brothers
has
to
smoke
on
the
sly
have
you
many
irish
people
about
here
miss
q
none
only
the
fogartys
and
they
the
best
neighbours
we
got
and
was
nobody
seen
near
the
stack
before
the
fire
broke
out
not
a
soul
i
was
past
there
myself
not
twenty
minutes
before
we
seen
the
fire
but
i
was
going
middling
smart
and
i
did
see
anybody
nothing
only
morgan
big
white
pig
curled
under
the
edge
of
the
stack
that
always
jumps
out
of
the
sty
and
comes
over
here
and
breaks
into
our
garden
well
father
always
threatening
to
shoot
that
pig
and
me
never
thinking
i
told
him
it
was
there
and
he
got
his
gun
and
went
after
it
and
us
in
a
fright
for
fear
he
would
find
it
but
he
did
then
when
we
seen
him
well
out
of
sight
i
went
over
to
the
stack
quietly
to
shoo
the
pig
home
but
it
was
gone
and
there
was
no
sign
of
fire
then
and
nobody
in
sight
then
my
sisters
and
me
was
just
starting
out
to
the
and
mother
had
begun
to
take
the
things
off
the
line
when
little
enoch
seen
the
fire
we
could
make
it
out
at
all
and
i
examined
up
and
down
the
drain
for
but
there
was
none
and
just
before
you
come
i
picked
up
the
track
of
the
horse
i
was
riding
to
see
if
his
feet
had
struck
fire
on
anything
but
i
was
as
wise
as
ever
ah
the
horse
was
shod
miss
q
no
he
barefooted
all
round
well
he
trod
on
a
piece
of
a
brick
near
the
corner
of
the
garden
but
the
fire
never
travelled
from
there
it
very
unaccountable
very
i
wonder
would
there
have
been
such
a
thing
as
a
broken
bottle
anywhere
about
the
stack
miss
q
the
sun
came
out
unusually
strong
this
morning
i
noticed
and
it
a
scientific
fact
that
the
action
of
the
solar
rays
focussed
by
such
a
medium
as
i
have
suggested
will
produce
ignition
provided
of
course
that
the
inflammable
material
is
in
the
angle
of
refraction
i
do
know
sir
she
replied
reverently
why
gold
has
been
melted
in
four
seconds
silver
in
three
and
steel
in
ten
under
the
mere
influence
of
the
sun
concentrated
by
a
lens
she
shivered
and
i
magnanimously
withheld
my
hand
if
this
hypothesis
should
prove
untenable
i
continued
gently
we
may
assume
spontaneous
ignition
produced
by
chemical
combination
nor
are
we
confined
to
this
supposition
silex
is
an
element
which
enters
largely
into
the
composition
of
wheaten
straw
and
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
in
most
cases
where
fire
is
purposely
generated
by
the
agency
of
some
form
of
silex
is
enlisted
flint
for
instance
or
the
silicious
covering
of
endogenous
plants
such
as
bamboo
and
so
forth
a
theory
might
be
built
on
this
it
seems
very
reasonable
sir
she
murmured
anyway
i
glad
the
old
stack
out
of
the
road
the
place
looks
a
lot
cleaner
well
i
wo
keep
you
out
in
the
sun
said
i
reluctantly
good
bye
miss
q
and
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
oh
do
mention
it
i
sure
we
very
happy
to
she
hesitated
blushing
desperately
well
miss
jemima
she
murmured
her
hand
i
might
see
you
again
some
time
i
remarked
almost
unconsciously
as
our
fingers
met
i
hope
so
she
faltered
jim
said
i
slowly
releasing
her
hand
the
word
sounded
like
a
breath
of
evening
air
kissing
the
foliage
then
the
maiden
with
the
meek
brown
eyes
and
the
pathetic
evidence
of
australian
nationality
on
her
upper
lip
returned
to
her
simple
duties
and
the
remembrance
of
beaudesart
came
down
on
me
like
a
thousand
of
bricks
such
is
life
but
my
difficulties
were
over
for
the
time
being
my
loco

jolted
its
way
over
the
rough
section
carrying
away
an
obstruction
labelled
and
had
reached
the
next
points
i
was
still
two
or
three
days
ahead
of
my
official
work
and
there
had
happened
to
be
a
stray
in
the
pocket
of
the
spare
oriflamme
i
had
unfurled
at
my
camp
should
i
push
on
to
hay
on
the
strength
of
that
draw
my
and
send
my
clothier
a
guileful
letter
containing
a
for
say
thirty
shillings
this
would
test
his
awfulness
at
finding
out
things
besides
giving
myself
morally
a
clean
bill
of
health
or
should
i
first
walk
across
to
b
and
get
dick
l
to
shift
some
of
my
inborn
ignorance
re
palestine
i
decided
on
the
latter
line
of
action
and
followed
it
with
well
at
all
events
i
have
the
compensating
consciousness
of
a
dignity
uncompromised
and
a
nonchalance
unruffled
in
the

really
interesting
descriptions
of
tasmania
concerning
my
lapse
of

on
the

i
merely
remarked
that
the

was
caused
my
circumstances
over
which
i
spent
a
couple
of
days
besides
sunday
at
b
place
while
the
fisherman
kept
an
eye
on
my
horses
i
helped
b
to
work
out
a
new
and
rotten
idea
of
a
pump
dick
handing
me
things
and
holding
the
other
end
on
the
first
afternoon
a
couple
of
hours
after
my
arrival
i
drove
into
for
some
blacksmith
work
and
whilst
it
was
being
done
i
looked
in
at
the
express
office
and
had
a
gossip
with
archimedes
on
the
topics
of
the
day
and
now
whilst
duly
appreciating
the
rectitude
of
soul
which
has
carried
me
through
this
trying
disclosure
you
will
surely
condone
the
obscurity
in
which

to
envelop

what
would
your

rede
you
from
that
record
if
he
had
possession
of
my
diary
something
mysterious
and
momentous
no
doubt
and
probably
connected
with
buried
treasure
yet
it
is
only
the
abstract
and
brief
chronicle
of
a
fair
average
day
a
day
happy
in
having
no
history
worth
mentioning
merely
a
drowsy
morning
an
idle
and
a
stirring
afternoon
life
is
largely
composed
of
such
uneventful
days
and
these
are
therefore
most
worthy
of
careful
analysis
how
easy
it
is
to
recall
the
scene
the
lachlan
river
filled
by
summer
rains
far
away
among
the
mountains
to
a
width
of
something
like
thirty
yards
flowing
silently
past
and
going
to
waste
irregular
areas
of
lignum
hundreds
of
acres
in
extent
and
eight
or
ten
feet
in
height
representing
swamps
and
long
serpentine
reaches
of
the
same
but
higher
in
growth
indicating
billabongs
of
the
river
the
river
itself
fringed
and
the
adjacent
low
ground
dotted
with
swamp
box
river
coolibah
and
the
latter
small
and
stunted
in
comparison
with
the
giants
of
its
species
on
the
murray
and
lower
goulburn
on
both
sides
of
the
river
far
as
the
eye
can
command
extend
the
level
plains
of
black
or
soil
broken
here
and
there
by
clumps
and
belts
of
swamp
box
now
cut
off
from
the
line
of
the
horizon
by
the
quivering
glassy
stratum
of
the
lower
atmosphere
and
where
the
boundary
fence
of
mondunbarra
and
avondale
crosses
the
plain
is
seen
a
fair
example
of
the
mirage
that
phenomenon
so
vaguely
apprehended
in
regions
outside
its
domain
and
so
little
noticed
where
repetition
has
made
it
familiar
but
there
it
is
no
film
on
the
plain
no
shimmering
distortion
of
objects
in
but
to
all
appearance
a
fine
sheet
of
silvery
water
two
hundred
yards
distant
about
the
same
in
average
width
and
in
length
from
right
to
left
both
banks
are
clearly
defined
irregular
promontories
jut
far
out
into
the
smooth
water
from
each
side
and
the
boundary
fence
crosses
it
post
after
post
in
diminishing
perspective
like
any
fence
standing
in
shallow
sunlit
water
the
most
critical
and
deliberate
examination
can
no
more
detect
evidence
of
phantasy
in
the
unreal
water
than
in
the
real
fence
the
mirage
is
one
of
nature
obscure
and
cheerless
jokes
and
in
this
instance
as
in
some
few
others
she
is
beyond
art
she
even
assists
the
illusion
by
a
very
slight
depression
of
the
plain
in
the
right
place
in
fact
an
artist
picture
of
a
mirage
would
be
his
picture
of
a
unruffled
lake
also
the
most
skilful
in
attempting
to
contrast
the
appearance
of
water
with
that
of
its
would
become
as
confused
and
hazy
as
any
clergyman
taxed
to
differentiate
his
creed
from
that
of
the
mollah
running
the
opposition
and
nature
in
taking
this
mirthless
rise
out
of
the
spectator
never
repeats
herself
in
the
particulars
of
distance
area
or
configuration
of
her
simulacre
it
may
be
a
mere
stripe
across
the
road
the
brown
sinuous
track
disappearing
beneath
its
surface
to
on
the
opposing
shore
it
may
be
no
larger
than
a
good
gilgie
or
it
may
be
the
counterfeit
presentment
of
a
sheet
of
water
miles
in
extent
though
this
last
is
rare
a
hot
day
is
not
an
imperative
condition
of
the
true
mirage
but
the
ground
must
be
open
plain
or
nearly
so
the
atmosphere
must
be
clear
and
the
ground
thoroughly
dry
it
is
worthy
of
notice
that
horses
and
cattle
are
entirely
insusceptible
to
the
illusion
another
fact
not
so
noteworthy
in
view
of
the
general
perversity
of
inanimate
things
is
that
you
never
see
a
mirage
when
you
are
watching
for
it
to
decide
an
argument
it
always
presents
itself
when
you
have
no
interest
in
it
in
this
quality
of
irredeemable
cussedness
it
resembles
the
emu
nest
no
one
ever
found
that
when
he
was
looking
for
it
no
one
ever
found
it
except
he
was
in
a
raging
hurry
with
a
long
stage
to
go
and
no
likelihood
of
coming
back
by
the
same
route
to
complete
the
picture
which
i
want
you
to
carry
in
your
mind
eye
you
will
imagine
cleopatra
and
bunyip
standing
under
a
coolibah
standing
heads
and
points
after
the
manner
of
equine
mates
each
switching
the
flies
and
mosquitos
off
his
comrade
face
and
shivering
them
off
such
parts
of
his
own
body
as
possessed
the
requisite
faculty
and
in
the
centre
of
a
clear
place
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
away
you
may
notice
a
apparently
deserted
the
heavy
dark
with
dust
and
grease
thrown
across
the
arched
jigger
forming
a
tent
on
the
body
and
falling
over
the
wheels
nearly
to
the
ground
yet
displaying
the
outline
of
the
sydney
pattern
which
as
every
schoolgirl
knows
differs
from
that
of
riverina
in
the
foreground
of
this
picture
you
may
fancy
the
present
annalist
lying
or
as
lying
is
an
ill
phrase
and
peculiarly
inapplicable
just
here
we
say
reclining
pipe
in
mouth
on
a
patch
of
pennyroyal
trying
to
one
of
ouida
novels
and
thinking
ah
your
a
wanton
what
a
sweet
spicy
piquant
thing
it
must
be
to
be
lured
to
destruction
by
a
tigress
with
slumbrous
dark
eyes
no
such
romance
for
the
annalist
poor
man
such
then
was
my
benevolent
and
creditable
allotment
such
my
unworthy
vagary
at
the
time
this
record
opens
i
had
camped
in
the
dead
man
bend
late
on
the
previous
evening
had
a
little
after
sunrise
and
turned
out
a
little
after
eleven
then
a
dip
in
the
river
to
clear
away
the
cobwebs
and
a
breakfast
which
if
not
in
its
accessories
was
at
least
enjoyed
at
a
fashionable
hour
had
made
me
feel
as
if
i
wanted
a
quiet
smoke
out
of
the
gigantic
meerschaum
which
i
unpack
only
on
special
occasions
and
something
demoralising
to
read
but
the
austere
pipe
resented
this
unworthy
alliance
so
strongly
that
for
peace
sake
i
had
to
lay
aside
the
literary
then
i
remembered
the
official
letter
i
had
received
on
the
previous
day
i
had
merely
glanced
over
it
before
acting
on
the
orders
it
contained
now
i
the
document
and
pharisaically
contemplated
the
penmanship
and
orthography
of
my
superior
officer
sydney

t
collins

sir
haveing
got
months
leave
of
abscence
you
are

ynnnnnnnnly
r
wmlnlnllnn
i
was
now
on
my
way
to
keep
the
apointment
i
was
still
about
twenty
miles
from
poondoo
and
the
next
day
would
be
monday
prox
i
intended
to
start
again
at
about
two
so
i
had
still
a
couple
of
hours
to
spend
in
what
civilians
call
rest
and
soldiers
fatigue
whilst
studying
such
problems
as
might
present
themselves
for
solution
pup
was
safe
by
my
side
and
i
had
nothing
to
trouble
myself
about
a
thought
of
the
transitoriness
and
uncertainty
of
life
did
occur
to
me
as
it
has
done
to
thinkers
and
of
all
ages
but
i
deftly
applied
the
reflection
to
my
superior
officer
and
so
turned
everything
to
commodity
the
unfortunate
young
fellow
i
thought
is
a
confirmed
invalid
sure
enough
a
trip
round
the
colonies
may
liven
him
up
a
bit
or
on
the
other
hand
it
may
not
and
if
he
returns
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
kind
hands
will
soothe
his
pillow
and
so
forth
and
when
with
dirges
due
in
sad
array
they
have
performed
the
last
melancholy
offices
i
trust
that
some
one
will
be
found
to
dress
with
simple
hands
his
rural
tomb
i
would
do
it
myself
for
as
the
poet
says
ah
surely
nothing
dies
but
something
mourns
a
sweet
fancy
but
not
so
filling
as
the
cognate
reflection
somebody
calling
from
the
other
side
of
the
river
probably
some
forlorn
and
shipwreck
brother
looking
for
his
mates
the
cognate
reflection
namely
that
nothing
withdraws
but
it
leaves
room
for
a
successor
and
this
successor
thus
favoured
by
a
providence
which
has
kindly
supervised
the
fall
of
the
antecedent
sparrow
will
be
entitled
to
live
in
a
weatherboard
house
with
the
water
and
a
up
to
the
footpath
and
a
few
hamburgs
in
the
back
yard
and
everything
comfortable
ah
me
it
is
the
thought
of
the
dove
peace
peace
orestes
like
i
breathe
this
prayer
thy
comrades
are
sleeping
go
sleep
thou
with
the
thought
of
the
dove
that
has
suggested
this
fairy
picture
of
the
dovecote
and
something
tells
me
that
jim
quarterman
is
not
likely
to
forget
a
certain
cavalier
who
called
one
day
about
a
dog
doubtless
her
memory
holds
him
enshrined
as
a
person
of
scientific
attainments
and
courtly
address
offering
a
contrast
i
trust
to
the
uninteresting
hayseeds
who
have
come
under
her
purview
and
will
he
not
come
again
yea
jim
mystery
and
revelation
as
thou
art
he
will
come
again
to
lay
at
thy
shapely
and
substantial
feet
the
trophy
of
an
ay
lay
thee
down
and
roar
of
an
ah
jim
tentatively
beloved
so
to
speak
by
this
solitary
but
by
no
means
desolate
heart
setting
aside
the
rises
i
would
take
out
of
thy
artlessness
and
the
way
i
would
whip
thy
simplicity
with
my
fine
wit
till
thou
wert
as
crestfallen
as
a
dried
pear
i
confess
a
spontaneous
thought
associated
with
the
mental
of
thy
wholesome
avoirdupois
no
less
indeed
than
the
psychological
recognition
of
an
in
vain
in
vain
strike
other
chords
you
can
call
spirits
from
the
vasty
deep
but
will
they
come
when
you
do
call
for
them
an
tangible
visible
audible
which
would
make
jordan
the
easiest
of
all
roads
to
travel
by
thy
side
peerless
jim
crowning
triumph
of
darwinian
evolution
from
the
inert
mineral
through
countless
hairy
and
uninviting
types
how
precious
the
inexplicable
vital
spark
which
nevertheless
robs
thy
sculptured
form
of
all
cash
and
how
easy
to
read
in
that
gentle
personality
a
satisfying
comment
on
the
concluding
lines
of
faust
the
leadeth
us
upward
and
on
a
double
meaning
there
by
my
faith
alas
poor
little
jim
go
thy
ways
die
when
thou
wilt
for
maud
beaudesart
comes
h

rest
perturbed
spirit
by
thy
long
grey
beard
and
glittering
eye
now
wherefore
thou
me
for
maud
beaudesart
comes
my
memory
as
doth
the
raven

get
thee
to

nunnery
jim

my
door
for

no
less
than
three
consecutive
husbands
in
heaven
so
potently
has
her
proved
its
capacity
for
leading
people
upward
and
on
methinks
i
perceive
a
new
and
sinister
meaning
in
the
shakespearean
come
away
come
away
death
and
in
sad
cypress
let
me
be
laid
fly
away
fly
away
breath
i
am
slain
by
a
fair
cruel
maid
nicely
put
no
doubt
but
the
importance
of
a
departure
depends
very
much
on
the
no
appearance
your
worship
call
for
enobarbus
he
will
not
hear
thee
or
from
caesar
camp
say
am
none
of
thine
on
the
value
of
the
departed
for
instance
when
a
man
of
property
departs
he
leaves
his
possessions
behind
a
fact
noticed
by
many
poets
and
the
man
himself
is
replaced
without
cost
when
a
official
departs
such
as
a
royal
falconer
or
a
master
of
the
buckhounds
or
an
he
perforce
leaves
his
billet
behind
and
we
wish
him
bon
voyage
to
whichever
port
he
may
be
bound
but
when
a
philosopher
departs
in
this
untimely
fashion
he
leaves
nothing
and
echo
answers
authority
melts
from
you
leaves
nothing
but
a
few
rudimentary
theories
of
no
use
to
anyone
except
the
owner
inasmuch
as
no
one
else
can
develop
them
properly
just
a
few
evanescent
footprints
on
the
sands
of
time
which
would
require
only
a
certain
combination
of
age
and
facilities
for
cohesion
to
mature
into
on
the
sandstone
of
progress
all
on
the
debit
side
of
civilisation
ledger
you
observe
consequently
he
does
long
to
leave
these
fading
scenes
that
glide
so
quickly
by
and
when
the
poet
holds
it
truth
that
men
may
rise
on
of
their
dead
selves
to
higher
things
he
is
simply
talking
when
he
ought
to
be
sleeping
it
off
in
seclusion
i
understand
how
a
man
may
rise
on
the
of
his
defunct
superior
officer
to
higher
things
but
his
dead
self
it
do
alfred
it
wo
do
but
hark
that
heavy
sound
breaks
in
once
more
as
if
the
clouds
its
echo
would
who
is
he
whose
grief
bears
such
an
emphasis
whose
phrase
of
sorrow
makes
the
very
lignum
quiver
in
sympathy
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
look
round
and
see
so
i
turned
my
head
and
saw
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
about
eighty
yards
away
a
man
on
a
grey
horse
i
rose
and
advanced
toward
the
bank
why
mosey
said
i
is
that
you
how
does
your
honour
for
this
many
a
day
where

clear

hours

sollicker
could
you
get
them
from
him
yourself
i
did
try
i
was
glad
to
see
them
goin
i
begun
to
think
after
thinks
i
it
a
pity
o
the
poor
misforchunate
carrion
walkin
all
that
way
free
gracious
for
nothin
an
a

top
of

an
them
none

but
i
glad
for
alf
i
hate
that
beggar
i
would
len
him
my
knife
to
cut
up
a
pipe
o
tobacker
not
if
his
tongue
was
stickin
out
as
long
as
yer
arm
i
was
goin
to
demean
myself
to
tell
him
about
his
carrion
nyther
i
knowed
your
horses
when
i
seen
them
an
i
spotted
you
where
you
was
layin
down
sleepin
fit
to
break
yer
neck
an
i
bin
hollerin
at
you
till
i
black
in
the
face
i
begun
to
think
you
was
drunk
or
dead
or
somethin
bust
you
and
with
this
address
which
i
give
in
bowdlerised
form
the
young
fellow
turned
his
horse
and
disappeared
through
a
belt
of
lignum
i
walked
across
to
the
the
camp
had
a
strangely
desolate
and
deserted
appearance
three
yokes
lay
around
with
the
bows
and
keys
scattered
about
and
there
was
no
sign
of
a
under
the
wagon
lay
a
saddle
and
bridle
and
beside
them
the
swollen
and
distorted
body
of
alf
black
probably
the
only
thing
on
earth
that
had
loved
the
gloomy
misanthrope
i
lifted
the
edge
of
the
hot
greasy
tarpaulin
and
looked
on
the
flooring
of
the
wagon
partly
covered
with
heavy
coils
of
and
the
spare
yokes
and
chains
a
drink
of
water
for
god
sake
said
a
scarcely
intelligible
whisper
from
the
suffocating
gloom
of
the
almost
tent
i
threw
the
tarpaulin
back
off
the
end
of
the
wagon
and
ran
to
the
river
for
a
billy
of
water
then
vaulting
on
the
platform
i
saw
alf
lying
on
his
blankets
apparently
helpless
and
breathing
heavily
his
face
drawn
and
haggard
with
pain
i
raised
his
head
and
held
the
billy
to
his
lips
but
being
in
too
great
a
hurry
i
let
his
head
slip
off
my
hand
and
most
of
the
water
spilled
over
his
throat
and
chest
he
shrank
and
shivered
as
the
cool
deluge
seemed
to
fizz
on
his
burning
skin
but
drank
what
was
left
to
the
last
drop
now
turn
me
over
on
the
other
side
or
i
go
mad
he
whispered
he
shuddered
and
groaned
as
i
touched
him
but
with
one
hand
under
his
shoulders
and
the
other
under
his
bent
and
rigid
knees
i
slowly
turned
him
on
the
other
side
would
you
like
to
lie
on
your
back
for
a
change
i
asked
no
no
he
whispered
excitedly
my
heels
might
slip
and
straighten
my
knees
another
drink
of
water
please
i
brought
a
second
billy
of
water
but
he
turned
from
it
with
disgust
if
you
could
make
a
sort
of
an
effort
alf
i
suggested
he
treated
me
to
a
look
and
turned
away
his
face
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
rolled
back
the
tarpaulin
along
the
jigger
for
the
heat
was
still
suffocating
is
there
anything
more
i
can
do
for
you
just
now
alf
i
asked
presently
more
water
i
gave
him
a
drink
out
of
a
pannikin
and
as
i
laid
his
head
down
again
he
continued
in
the
same
painful
whisper
and
with
frequent
pauses
have
you
any
idea
where
my
bullocks
are
i
was
trying
to
keep
them
here
in
this
corner
of
mondunbarra
and
they
reasonably
safe
unless
unless
the
chinaman
knows
the
state
i
in
but
if
they
cross
the
boundary
into
avondale
tommy
will
hunt
them
over
the
river
and
sollicker
will
get
them
it
must
be
remembered
that
alf
was
camped
at
the
junction
of
three
runs
yoongoolee
lay
along
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
whilst
on
our
side
mondunbarra
and
avondale
were
separated
by
a
boundary
fence
which
ran
into
the
water
a
few
yards
beyond
where
the
wagon
stood
the
fence
much
damaged
by
floods
was
repaired
merely
to
the
standard
the
wagon
was
in
mondunbarra
they
across
the
river
now
alf
mosey
price
told
me
so
not
twenty
minutes
ago
across
the
river
hissed
alf
and
then
falling
heavily
back
whilst
a
low
moan
mingled
with
the
furious
grinding
of
his
teeth
they
got
into
avondale
and
tommy
has
hunted
them
across
may
the
holy
never
mind
let
them
go
i
had
enough
of
it
if
other
people
are
satisfied
i
sure
i
am
who
is
she
i
thought
and
i
was
just
lapsing
into
my
collins
yes
alf
would
you
be
kind
enough
to
lift
my
dog
into
the
wagon
i
have
been
able
to
call
him
lately
but
he
wo
be
far
off
bad
news
for
you
alf
the
poor
fellow
got
a
bait
somewhere
and
came
home
to
die
he
lying
under
the
wagon
beside
your
saddle
the
outlaw
turned
away
his
face
of
being
swift
says
taine
must
love
something
ay
and
short
of
being
too
morally
slow
to
catch
grubs
one
must
hate
something
see
then
that
you
hate
prayerfully
and
judiciously
while
i
was
thinking
that
every
minute
delay
would
make
my
journey
after
the
bullocks
a
little
longer
alf
suddenly
looked
round
you
need
stay
here
said
he
sharply
thin
blades
of
articulation
shooting
here
and
there
through
his
laboured
whisper
as
the
water
he
had
drunk
took
effect
on
his
swollen
tongue
if
you
would
come
again
in
an
hour
and
give
me
another
you
would
be
doing
more
for
me
than
i
would
do
for
you
what
day
is
this
sunday
december
the
ninth
he
pondered
awhile
i
lost
count
of
the
days
what
time
is
it
between
one
and
two
i
should
think
my
watch
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
murray
afternoon
of
course
i
think
i
ought
to
be
dead
by
this
time
what
keeping
you
here
i
want
to
be
alone
do
talk
nonsense
alf
i
pull
you
through
if
i
can
only
hit
the
complaint
have
you
any
symptoms
i
do
know
i
do
know
i
was
gradually
getting
worse
and
worse
for
a
week
or
more
but
still
able
to
yoke
up
a
few
quiet
bullocks
to
shift
the
wagon
every
day
till
at
last
one
night
i
just
managed
to
climb
in
here
to
get
away
from
the
mosquitos
i
do
know
what
night
it
was
or
how
the
time
has
passed
since
then
just
look
at
my
arms
if
you
have
any
curiosity
but
do
dare
to
prescribe
for
me
i
had
enough
of
your
doctoring
at
the
yellow
tank
blast
you
without
heeding
his
reminiscence
which
has
no
connection
with
the
present
memoir
i
untied
an
old
which
fastened
one
of
his
wristbands
and
drew
up
the
sleeve
the
long
sinewy
arm
now
wet
and
clammy
from
the
effect
of
the
water
he
had
drunk
was
helpless
and
shapeless
round
and
rigid
the
set
at
a
and
extremely
sensitive
to
pain
there
said
he
with
a
quivering
groan
the
other
arm
is
just
the
same
and
so
are
my
knees
and
ankles
and
my
head
fit
to
burst
and
i
one
mass
of
pains
all
over
it
all
up
with
me
collins
now
i
only
ask
one
favour
of
you
and
that
is
to
get
out
of
my
sight
i
be
back
in
two
or
three
hours
alf
said
i
rising
keep
your
mind
as
easy
as
possible
and
see
if
you
can
doze
off
to
sleep
so
i
returned
to
my
own
camp
and
with
all
speed
caught
and
equipped
cleopatra
then
after
chaining
pup
in
a
shady
place
i
stowed
some
in
the
crown
of
the
soft
hat
i
wore
then
shed
apparel
till
i
was
like
the
photo
of
some
champion
athlete
finally
i
stuck
the
spare
clothes
with
the
rest
of
my
riches
among
the
branches
of
a
coolibah
out
of
the
way
of
the
wild
pigs
the
next
moment
i
was
in
the
saddle
and
cleopatra
after
perfunctorily
illustrating
demosthenes
three
rules
of
oratory
the
first
action
the
second
ditto
the
third
turned
obediently
toward
the
river
and
was
soon
breasting
the
cool
current
while
with
one
arm
across
the
saddle
i
steered
him
for
the
most
promising
on
the
opposite
bank
let
me
remark
here
that
the
man
who
knows
no
better
than
to
remain
in
the
saddle
after
his
horse
has
lost
bottom
ought
never
to
go
out
of
sight
of
a
bridge
he
is
the
sort
of
adventurer
that
is
brought
to
light
a
week
afterward
per
medium
of
a
in
the
hollow
of
his
eye
perhaps
the
best
plan
of
all
though
no
hero
of
romance
could
do
such
a
thing
is
to
hang
on
to
the
horse
tail
also
never
wait
for
an
emergency
to
make
sure
that
your
mount
can
swim
many
a
man
has
lost
his
life
through
the
helpless
floundering
of
a
horse
bewildered
by
first
and
sudden
experience
of
deep
water
my
happened
to
be
none
of
the
best
after
clearing
the
water
it
required
all
cleopatra
strength
and
activity
to
climb
the
bank
having
slipped
into
the
saddle
as
he
regained
footing
i
was
lying
flat
against
the
side
of
his
neck
to
help
his
centre
of
gravity
and
give
him
a
hold
with
his
front
feet
when
he
brushed
under
a
low
coolibah
and
the
spur
of
a
broken
branch
or
something
started
at
the
neck
of
the
undergarment
which
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
name
and
ripped
it
to
the
very
tail
nearly
dragging
me
off
the
saddle
when
we
reached
level
ground
the
vestment
alluded
to
was
hanging
wet
and
sticky
on
my
arms
like
a
child
pinny
unfastened
behind
or
to
use
a
more
elegant
simile
like
the
front
half
of
a
herald
tabard
what
i
should
have
done
was
to
have
reversed
the
thing
and
put
it
on
like
a
jacket
but
being
in
a
desperate
hurry
and
slightly
annoyed
by
the
accident
and
not
feeling
the
sun
after
just
leaving
the
water
i
whipped
the
rag
off
altogether
and
threw
it
aside
in
two
seconds
more
cleopatra
was
stretching
away
with
his
long
eager
untiring
stride
towards
yoongoolee
distant
about
sixteen
miles
slackening
speed
now
and
then
to
cross
creeks
and
rough
places
i
found
myself
following
a
pad
and
noticed
the
fresh
tracks
of
the
bullocks
mile
after
mile
at
last
i
heard
across
the
lignum
the
jangle
of
a
brass
bell
and
the
plock
of
an
iron
frog
and
presently
my
quarry
appeared
in
sight
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
ahead
to
do
the
justice
he
was
driving
the
cattle
quietly
and
considerately
he
looked
round
on
hearing
the
clatter
of
horse
feet
but
my
mazeppa
aspect
seemed
neither
to
surprise
nor
disconcert
him
he
was
altogether
a
stranger
to
me
for
several
years
i
had
known
him
by
sight
as
a
solid
phlegmatic
man
on
a
solid
phlegmatic
cob
and
i
suppose
he
had
his
own
crude
estimate
of
me
though
we
had
never
had
occasion
to
exchange
civilities
but
now
after
a
five
miles
chase
the
sight
of
the
man
acted
on
my
moral
nature
as
vinegar
is
erroneously
supposed
to
act
on
nitre
i
beside
him
the
irresistible
was
about
to
encounter
the
immovable
and
even
in
the
excitement
of
the
time
i
awaited
the
result
with
scientific
interest
when
a
collision
of
this
kind
takes
place
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
irresistible
bounces
off
in
a
more
or
less
damaged
state
at
other
times
the
immovable
is
scattered
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
in
the
form
of
scrap
while
the
irresistible
slightly
checked
perhaps
in
speed
sails
on
its
way
but
you
can
never
tell
where
are
you
taking
these
bullocks
i
demanded
in
a
tone
which
i
am
sorry
to
say
reflected
as
little
credit
on
my
politeness
as
on
my
philosophy
steation
yaads
he
replied
indifferently
and
with
a
strong
english
accent
did
you
take
them
off
purchased
land
i
asked
eyeing
him
keenly
oi
teuk
animals
horf
of
run
he
remarked
rather
than
replied
without
condescending
to
look
at
me
do
you
know
what
day
this
is
i
inquired
magisterially
zabbath
he
replied
kindly
and
do
you
know
there
a
new
act
passed
act
they
call
it
that
makes
the
removing
of
from
pastoral
leasehold
on
sundays
a
misdemeanour
punishable
by
a
term
of
imprisonment
not
exceeding
twelve
months
with
or
without
hard
labour
granny
he
remarked
driven
back
in
disorder
i
hurried
up
my
second
do
you
know
who
these
bullocks
belong
to
i
inquired
ominously
something
akin
to
a
smile
flickered
round
the
shaven
lips
of
the
descendant
of
hengist
as
contemplating
the
lop
ears
of
his
horse
he
observedly
contentedly
ees
shure
an
oi

not

horf
o

will
you
have
it
now
or
wait
till
you
get
it
i
asked
betrayed
by
the
annoyance
of
the
moment
into
a
species
of
vulgarity
unbecoming
an
officer
and
gentleman
i
do
mind
paying
you
the
money
provided
it
clears
the
bullocks
for
the
future
not
otherwise
in
the
meantime
i
going
to
take
them
or
no
pay
be
to
resky
he
inquired
slightly
reining
his
hippopotamus
and
looking
me
frankly
in
the
face
whilst
an
almost
merry
twinkle
animated
his
small
blue
eyes
by
no
means
i
replied
suavely
and
we
rode
together
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
i
had
wakened
the
wrong
man
the
immovable
had
scored
simply
because
he
was
a
person
of
one
idea
and
that
idea
panoplied
in
impenetrable
ignorance
a
compound
idea
by
the
way
namely
that
alf
bullocks
were
going
to
the
station
yards
and
that
he
was
taking
them
there
all
this
was
apparent
to
me
as
i
regarded
him
out
of
the
comer
of
my
eye
foak
bea
ter

he
remarked
calmly
a
gentleman
against
the
world
for
i
sneered
aiming
in
desperation
at
the
heel
by
which
mother
nature
had
held
him
during
his
baptism
in
the
thick
slab
bath
of
undiluted
scientific
symbol
jn
bl

is

he
argued
as
the
good
penetrated
his
epidermis
fair
in
the
vulnerable
spot
i
laughed
contemptuously

with

he
asked
in
wavering
expostulation
the
point
now
settling
in
the
vascular
tissues

the

right

i
retorted
with
insolent

and
still

judiciously
assisting
the

i
surprised
at
a
gentleman
in
your
position
making
excuses
like
that
do
you
know
and
my
tones
became
soft
and
confidential
something
struck
me
that
you
were
an
englishman
even
this
was
too
strong
i
wish
you
were
both
for
my
sake
and
your
own
however
that
be
helped
now
for
the

you
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
you
had
your

and
that
you
walked
a

bullocks
off
to

yard
while
he
was
helpless
yes

i
glad
you
not
an

but
the

too
hot
for

so
i
must
be
getting
back
and
if
i
said
anything
to
offend
you
i
sorry
for
it
and
i
beg
your
pardon
then
still
regarding
him
out
of
the
comer
of
my
eye
i
turned
cleopatra
slowly
round
he
snorted

the

slapped

not
round

flank
for
the
animal
had
none
with
his
doubled
and
turned
off
the
track
at
a
beckoning
me
to
follow
when
he
had
gone
twenty
yards
he
pulled
steadily
on
one
rein
and
so
to
speak
wore
his
ship
of
the
plains
round
till
we
faced
the
cattle
again
for
i
had
simultaneously
pirouetted
cleopatra

the
black
collie
was
sitting
where
he
had
stopped
on
the
instant
that
we
had
turned
off
sitting
with
his
head
slightly
canted
to
one
side
one
ear
limp
and
pendant
the
other
partly
erect
and
with
something
like
a
smile
on
his
expectant
face
on
hearing
the
order
he
made
a
wide
circuit
round
the
cattle
and
quietly
turned
them
back
along
the
track
where
he
followed
them
as
before
meanwhile
sollicker
sullenly
slipped
off
his
linen
coat
and
handed
it
to
me
with
a
low
growl
i
thanked
him
with
great
sincerity
and
put
it
on
but
his
glance
at
me
as
we
behind
the
cattle
seemed
to
demand
further
appreciation
and
i
was
not
slow
to
respond
partly
from
a
sense
of
obligation
but
principally
from
a
broadening
hope
of
extended
concession
i
had
already
selected
him
as
a
singularly
eligible
guardian
for
bullocks
and
i
knew
that
if
i
could
once
get
him
to
accept
the
trust
nothing
short
of
dynamite
would
shift
him
but
the
seduction
of
a
purpose
is
a
contract
not
to
be
taken
by
any
of
your
mushroom
mental
firms
and
this
was
a
large
order
of
course
the
diplomatic
of
nature
has
served
as
a
letter
of
introduction
to
the
man
now
i
would
follow
up
the
national
phase
of
this
delicate
point
of
contact
no
use
i
remarked
doggedly
i
give
it
up
i
ca
find
words
this
is
not
a
personal
favour
it
an
evidence
of
the
principle
that
makes
an
englishman
respected
all
over
the
world
all
over
the
world
sir
for
you
know
the
sun
follows
the
english
right
round
the
earth
now
i
ca
flatter
you
i
see
you
in
the
bottomless
pit

anything
of

just
look

how
did
you

a

of

a
very
common
one
too
and
good
enough
till
the
proper
person
comes
interfering

tenure
my
companion
seeing
me
at
fault
remarked
with
elephantine
waggishness
dog
coomed
deaoun
t
me
f
ebm
i
assumed
the
look
of
a
man
who
conceals
staggering
bewilderment
under
the
transparent
disguise
of
incredulity
and
sollicker
looking
like
thurlow
wiser
than
any
man
ever
was
enjoyed
my
discomfiture
as
much
as
he
was
capable
of
enjoying
anything
then
he
proceeded
with
great
deliberation
to
interpret
his
oracular
utterance
but
first
with
a
powerful
facial
exertion
he
wrenched
his
mouth
and
nose
to
one
side
inhaling
vigorously
through
the
lee
nostril
then
cleared
his
throat
with
the
sound
of
a
catching
on
an
old
nail
and
sent
the
result
whirling
from
his
mouth
at
a
butterfly
on
a
stem
of
lignum
sent
it
with
such
accurate
calculation
of
the
distance
of
his
object
the
trajectory
of
his
missile
and
the
pace
of
his
horse
that
the
mucous
disc
smote
the
ornamental
insect

on

laying
it
out
never

this

opened
afresh
solicker
well
of
english
undefiled
and
another
hour
passed
pleasantly
enough
except
that
alf
bullocks
preyed
on
my
mind
and
i
wanted
them
to
prey
on
yoongoolee
instead
i
therefore
modestly
opened
my
mouth
in
parable
recounting
some
noteworthy
reminiscences
as
they
occurred
to
my
imagination
and
always
slightly
or
scornfully
referring
to
the
magnanimous
and
indomitable
hero
of
my
yarn
as
of
these
english
fools
or
as
ass
of
a
john
bull
that
had
sense
enough
to
mind
his
own
business
these
apologues
all
seemed
to
point
toward
chivalrous
succour
of
the
helpless
and
afflicted
as
a
conspicuous
weakness
of
the
english
character
and
sollicker
listened
with
a
stolid
approbation
unfortunately
altogether
objective
in
character
i
never
dealt
better
since
i
was
a
man
no
one
has
dealt
better
since
antony
harangued
the
sollickers
of
his
day
on
dead
caesar
behalf
but
i
differed
from
antony
so
largely
in
result
that
the
comparison
is
seriously
disturbed
there
was
no
more
spring
in
my
auditor
than
in
a
bag
of
sand
the
honest
fellow
ignorance
stood
solidly
in
the
way
rendering
prevarication
or
quibble
or
any
form
of
subterfuge
unnecessary
on
his
part
he
merely
formed
himself
into
a
hollow
square
and
casually
glanced
at
the
impossibility
of
those
particular
bullocks
loafing
on
his
paddock
if
they
came
across
the
river
again
he
would
hunt
them
back
into
mondunbarra
he
would
do
that
much
but
muster
orders
were
orders
two
bullock
drivers
here
a
truculent
look
came
over
the
retainer
face
had
selected
in
sight
of
the
very
and
now
all
working
bullocks
found
loafing
on
the
run
were
to
be
yarded
at
the
station
this
lot
being
specially
noticed
for
muster
had
a
bit
of
a
derry
on
alf
by
way
of
changing
the
subject
sollicker
became
confidential
he
had
been
in
his
present
employ
ever
since
his
arrival
in
the
country
ten
years
before
and
had
never
set
foot
outside
the
run
during
that
time
he
was
married
three
years
ago
come
boxing
day
to
the
station
bullockdriver
daughter
a
girl
who
had
been
in
service
at
the
house
but
could
hit
it
with
the
missus
muster
wanted
to
see
him
settled
down
and
had
fetched
the
parson
to
do
the
job
he
had
only
one
of
a
family
a
little
boy
called
roderick
in
honour
of
muster
his
own
name
true
to
the
rule
of
the
higher
nomenology
was
edward
stanley
vivian
not
zedekiah
backband
as
the
reader
might
be
prone
to
imagine
and
his
age
was
if
i
knew
anyone
in
straits
for
a
bit
of
ready
cash
i
was
to
send
that
afflicted
person
to
him
for
relief
he
liked
to
oblige
people
and
his
tariff
was
fifteen
per
cent
per
annum
but
the
security
must
be
unexceptionable
i
gave
him
some
details
of
alf
sickness
and
asked
whether
he
had
any
medicine
at
home
by
preference
i
have
great
faith
in
this
specific
and
i
tell
you
the
reason
a
few
years
before
the
date
of
these
events
it
had
been
my
fortune
to
be
associated
in
arduous
and
unhealthy
work
with
fifteen
or
twenty
of
the
order
of
society
which
daniel
was
accustomed
to
refer
to
as
highly
important
and
respectable
class
the
men
of
no
property
true
makers
of
history
if
the
fools
only
knew
or
could
be
taught
their
power
and
responsibility
occasionally
one
of
these
potential
rulers
and
practical
slaves
would
come
to
me
with
white
lips
and
unsteady
pace
i
say
tom
i
ai
a
man
to
while
i
got
a
sanguinary
leg
to
stan
on
but
i
gone
in
the
inside
some
road
i
jist
bin
slingin
up
every
sanguinary
thing
i
et
for
the
last
month
an
i
as
weak
as
a
sanguinary
cat
i
must
ding
it
mebbe
i
be
right
if
i
jist
step
over
to
the
an
git
here
i
would
stop
him
and
endeavour
to
establish
a
diagnosis
but
a
man
with
the
vocabulary
of
a
stratford
whatever
a
woolcomber
may
be
of
the
century
a
vocabulary
of
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
words
mostly
obscene
is
placed
at
a
grave
disadvantage
when
confronted
by
scientific
terminology
and
my
patient
casting
symptomatic
precision
to
the
winds
and
roughly
averaging
his
malady
would
succinctly
describe
himself
as
sanguinary
bad
that
was
all
that
was
wrong
with
him
nevertheless
having
a
little
theory
of
my
own
respecting
sickness
i
always
undertook
to
grapple
with
the
complaint
i
had
noticed
as
a
singular
feature
in
that
the
more
it
is
diluted
the
more
unspeakably
nauseous
and
suffocating
it
becomes
wherefore
my
medicine
chest
consisted
merely
of
a
couple
of
bottles
of
this
rousing
drug
my
practice
was
to
exhibit
tablespoonfuls
of
the
panacea
in
a
quart
of
oxide
of
hydrogen
vulgarly
known
as
water
when
my
patient
had
swallowed
that
lot
i
caused
him
to
lie
down
in
some
shady
place
till
the
internal
conflagration
produced
by
the
potent
had
subsided
to
and
then
sent
him
back
to
his
work
like
a
giant
refreshed
with
new
wine
i
never
knew
one
of
those
potentates
to
be
sick
the
second
time
sollicker
did
know
whether
his
wife
had
any
medicine
but
we
could
see
accordingly
when
the
twenty
bullocks
and
the
horse
had
landed
themselves
on
mondunbarra
close
to
alf
camp
we
started
at
a
canter
and
after
riding
a
couple
of
miles
pulled
up
at
a
comfortable
cottage
by
the
drooping
silvery
foliage
of
a
clump
of
myall
sollicker
turned
his
moke
loose
in
the
paddock
i
tied
my
horse
to
the
fence
and
we
entered
the
house
a
tall
slight
sunburnt
and
decidedly
handsome
young
woman

a
brown
moustache

his

with
kindly
concern
and
with
an
easy
mastery
of
expression
seldom
attained
by
her
sex

shoved

when
i

she
opened
a
box
and
produced
a
small
octagonal
blue
bottle
which
she
held
up
to
the
light
chlorodyne
she
explained
an
some

but
it
equal

she
handed
me
the
bottle
and
proceeded
to
lay
the
table
i
endeavoured
to
make
friends
with
roddy
but
he
was
very
shy
as

usually
are

a
fine
little

i
remarked
how
old
is
he
he
was
two

she
replied
with
vainglory
no

petulantly
what

truly

murmured
her
husband
sadly
and
as
he
spoke
an
inch
of

tongue
shot
momentarily
into

as
she
turned
her
comely
face
overflowing
with
merriment
toward
me
my

was
cut
out
for
a

she
remarked
i
tell
him
it

it

such

at

i
drifted
into
a

of
insoluble
enigmas
and
perplexing
hypotheses

with

as
the

awkwardly

tenderly
wiped
the
little

nose
i
was
still
lost

are
the

easier
than
to

which
will
fall
in
splinters
before
the
first
of
unparleying
fact
what
authority
had
the

man
or
i
to
dogmatise
on
the
coming
australian
just
the
same
authority
as
marcus

froude
or
francis

and
that
is
exactly
none
deductive
reasoning
of

kind
is
seldom

have

from

association
and
what
not
the
development
of
those
silky
honours
which
grace
the
upper
lip
of
the
australienne
no
doubt
there
are
certain
occult
laws
which
govern
these
things
but
we
have
even
mastered
the
laws
themselves
and
how
are
we
going
to
forecast
their
operation
here
was
an
example
vivian
was
a
type
englishman
of
his
particular
his
wife
was
a
type
australienne
of
the
species
and
their
little
boy
was
almost
comically
scottish
in
features
expression
and
bearing
where
are
your
theories
now
atavism
is
inadmissible
and
fright
is
the
thinnest
and
most
unscientific
subterfuge
extant
the
coming
australian
is
a
problem
vivian
overwhelmed
me
with
instructions
concerning
alf
and
frankly
urged
me
to
hurry
back
to
his
assistance
i
paid
little
heed
to
her
advice
for
i
knew
he
would
soon
come
round
and
in
the
meantime
my
mind
was
fully
occupied
with
his
team
after
drinking
a
cup
of
tea
i
shook
hands
with
her
and
lingered
at
the
door
looking
at
her
husband
as
he
amused
himself
with
roddy
i
leave
your
coat
on
the
fence
vivian
said
i
at
length
horrite
you
want
to
be
as
lively
as
god
let
you
said
the
excellent
woman
accompanying
me
to
my
horse
i
wo
be
satisfied
till
i
see
you
off
very
well
thought
i
on
your
own
head
be
it
so
i
took
off
the
linen
coat
and
handed
it
to
her
you
should
kep
on
a
inside
shirt
she
remarked
kindly
them
shoulders
o
yours
give
you
particular
hell
to
morrow
why
you
like
a
boiled
crawfish
now
hides
like
that
o
yours
she
added
testing
with
her
finger
and
thumb
the
integument
on
my
near
flank
as
i
hastily
placed
my
bare
foot
in
the
stirrup
ai
worth
a
tinker
dam
for
standin
the
sun
for
the
information
of
people
whose
education
may
unhappily
have
been
neglected
it
will
be
right
to
mention
that
the
little
morsel
of
chewed
bread
which
a
of
the
old
school
places
on
his
seam
to
check
the
inconvenient
flow
of
the
solder
is
technically
and
appropriately
termed
a
dam
it
is
the
conceivable
minimum
of
commercial
value
the
sun
was
still
above
the
trees
when
i
unsaddled
cleopatra
at
my
camp
and
resumed
my
clothes
the
were
ringing
among
the
lignum
as
the
animals
exerted
themselves
to
make
up
for
lost
time
and
how
are
we
now
said
i
assuming
a
cheerful
professional
air
as
i
swung
myself
on
the
platform
of
the
wagon
i
secured
a
drop
of
one
of
our
most
valuable
antiphlogistics
which
is
precisely
what
you
require
as
the
trouble
is
distinctly
anthrodymic
you
be
right
in
a
couple
of
days
no
collins
replied
alf
gently
i
never
be
right
in
the
sense
you
mean
i
wo
take
any
medicine
i
done
with
everything
help
me
to
turn
over
again
please
and
give
me
another
drink
of
water
i
want
to
tell
you
something
after
giving
him
a
turn
over
i
took
the
billy
and
replenished
it
at
the
river
before
getting
into
the
wagon
again
i
emptied
the
contents
of
bottle
into
half
a
of
the
oxide
of
hydrogen
and
stirred
the
potion
thoroughly
with
a
stick
then
returning
to
my
patient
i
raised
his
head
and
held
the
pannikin
to
his
lips
he
finished
the
draught
unconscious
of
its
medicinal
virtues
and
i
refolded
the
old
overcoat
which
served
as
a
pillow
and
laid
him
down
as
gently
as
possible
the
water
seems
to
have
a
peculiar
taste
he
murmured
i
do
notice
my
sight
failing
yet
but
my
hearing
is
all
deranged
i
hear
your
voice
through
a
ringing
of
bells
and
a
sound
like
a
distant
waterfall
i
just
on
the
collins
i
very
little
more
to
suffer
and
why
should
i
come
back
to
begin
it
all
again
how
long
is
it
since
you
left
me
from
four
to
five
hours
i
think
i
put
your
bullocks
together
they
re
close
by
well
now
i
would
have
the
slightest
idea
whether
it
was
one
hour
or
twelve
i
been
in
the
since
then
or
a
spirit
has
visited
me
here
i
heard
plain
and
clear
the
voice
of
a
woman
singing
old
familiar
songs
and
that
voice
has
been
silent
in
death
for
ten
years
silent
to
me
for
three
years
before
that
thirteen
years
that
may
not
seem
much
to
you
but
what
an
age
it
seems
to
me
it
was
no
dream
collins
i
saw
everything
as
i
see
now
but
i
heard
her
glorious
voice
as
i
used
to
hear
it
in
our
happy
days
and
i
felt
that
her
spirit
was
bringing
forgiveness
at
last
i
not
a
religious
man
collins
i
do
know
what
will
become
of
me
after
death
but
god
does
and
that
sufficient
for
me
i
never
believed
on
him
so
devoutly
as
i
do
now
that
he
has
vindicated
his
justice
upon
me
i
praise
him
for
avenging
an
act
of
the
blindest
folly
and
heartlessness
and
i
thank
him
that
my
punishment
is
over
at
last
there
listen
no
it
nothing
but
it
was
a
favourite
song
of
hers
and
while
you
were
away
i
heard
her
sing
it
with
new
meaning
in
every
syllable
my
poor
love
alf
alf
i
remonstrated
compose
yourself
and
go
to
sleep
if
you
can
the
tears
of
feebleness
had
accumulated
in
the
hollows
of
his
sunken
eyes
and
not
having
the
use
of
his
hands
he
was
throwing
his
head
from
side
to
side
to
clear
them
away
did
you
ever
make
a
terrible
mistake
in
life
collins
he
asked
at
length
before
i
could
reply
he
resumed
absently
when
i
was
a
boy
away
on
the
queensland
border
i
knew
a
squatter
as
fine
a
fellow
as
ever
lived
and
this
man
married
some
young
lady
in
sydney
and
brought
her
to
live
on
the
station
a
few
months
afterward
he
came
home
unexpectedly
at
about
two
one
morning
and
found
his
place
occupied
by
an
intimate
friend
of
his
own
a
young
barrister
who
was
staying
at
the
station
as
a
guest
he
managed
to
conceal
his
discovery
and
within
the
next
few
days
he
got
his
friend
to
draw
out
a
new
will
by
which
he
left
everything
without
reservation
to
his
wife
a
day
or
two
after
completing
the
will
he
took
his
gun
and
went
out
alone
he
did
come
home
that
night
and
next
day
one
of
the
station
hands
found
him
at
a
wire
fence
shot
straight
through
the
heart
accidentally
of
course
but
we
knew
better
it
might
have
been
accidental
alf
i
suggested
there
a
lot
of
supposition
in
the
story
none
collins
before
going
out
with
his
gun
he
wrote
a
letter
to
my
father
and
sent
it
by
a
trustworthy
blackfellow
my
father
got
the
letter
about
ten
at
night
and
he
had
a
horse
at
once
and
started
off
for
the
station
through
a
raging
thunderstorm
arriving
next
day
only
in
time
to
see
his
friend
body
before
it
was
moved
to
the
house
my
father
was
terribly
about
it
he
was
manager
of
an
adjoining
station
at
the
time
now
let
me
tell
you
another
true
story
pursued
alf
dreamily
five
years
ago
i
knew
a
man
on
the
maroo
a
with
a
wife
and
two
children
the
wife
got
soft
on
a
young
fellow
at
the
camp
and
everybody
except
the
husband
saw
how
things
stood
presently
the
husband
began
to
circulate
the
report
that
he
was
going
to
new
zealand
in
the
meantime
he
sent
the
two
children
to
a
in
wagga
he
was
in
no
hurry
afterward
he
sold
his
plant
to
the
station
and
bade
in
the
most
friendly
way
to
all
hands
including
the
don
juan
then
he
started
across
the
country
to
wagga
alone
with
his
wife
in
a
wagonette
are
you
listening
attentively
alf
but
suppose
i
boil
your
billy
and
two
years
afterward
a
flock
was
sold
off
the
station
i
was
speaking
of
for
western
queensland
and
one
of
the
station
men
went
with
the
party
to
see
the
sheep
delivered
curious
coincidence
he
met
on
the
new
station
his
old
acquaintance
the
with
his
two
children
and
a
second
wife
the
told
him
that
his
first
wife
had
died
soon
after
leaving
the
maroo
and
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
about
going
to
new
zealand
am
i
making
myself
clear
yes
so
far
you
know
the
man
you
speaking
of
slightly
i
delivered
goods
to
him
once
on
the
maroo
and
casually
heard
the
scandal
that
was
in
the
air
well
the
shearing
came
round
on
the
maroo
just
as
the
station
man
got
back
from
queensland
and
while
the
adjoining
station
was
mustering
for
the
shed
a
boundary
man
found
in
the
centre
of
one
of
the
paddocks
in
the
loneliest
barrenest
hole
of
a
place
in
new
south
wales
he
found
where
a
big
fire
had
been
made
and
some
bones
burnt
into
white
cinders
and
smashed
small
with
a
stick
he
kicked
the
ashes
over
and
found
the
steel
part
of
a
woman
stays
and
the
charred
heel
of
a
woman
boot
and
even
a
thimble
and
a
few
shillings
that
had
probably
been
in
her
pocket
i
was
on
the
station
at
the
time
waiting
for
wool
and
saw
the
relics
when
the
boundary
man
brought
them
in
there
are
queer
things
done
when
every
man
is
a
law
unto
himself
supposition
alf
and
strained
supposition
at
that
but
why
should
you
trouble
your
mind
about
these
things
there
was
no
supposition
on
the
station
where
the
things
were
found
nor
on
the
station
the
had
left
when
they
compared
notes
the
things
were
found
three
or
four
miles
off
a
bit
of
a
track
that
led
to
wagga
and
there
was
a
pine
of
a
year
and
a
half
old
growing
in
the
ashes
but
we
pass
that
story
i
want
you
to
listen
to
another
some
other
time
alf
i
make
you
a
drink
of
tea
and
when
i
was
young
continued
alf
doggedly
i
was
very
intimate
with
an
american
a
man
of
high
principle
and
fine
education
man
i
ever
knew
this
poor
fellow
was
a
drunkard
occasional
but
incorrigible
misfortune
had
driven
him
to
it
his
wife
was
dead
his
children
had
died
in
infancy
and
at
he
was
a
hopeless
wreck
he
worked
at
my
father
farm
on
the
hawkesbury
for
two
or
three
years
and
died
at
our
place
when
i
was
about
immediately
before
i
left
home
i
do
like
to
correct
you
alf
i
interposed
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
your
father
was
a
on
the
queensland
border
up
to
the
time
i
was
or
then
he
bought
a
place
on
the
hawkesbury
intending
poor
man
to
spend
the
evening
of
his
life
indulging
his
hobby
of
chemistry
while
i
took
the
care
of
the
place
off
his
hands
for
though
i
have
two
sisters
i
was
his
only
son
his
great
ambition
was
to
bequeath
some
chemical
discovery
to
future
generations
but
i
demolished
his
castles
in
the
air
along
with
my
own
it
no
odds
about
myself
but
my
poor
father
deserved
better
after
all
his
work
and
worry
ah
my
god
we
parted
in
anger
and
now
i
do
know
whether
he
alive
or
dead
the
prodigal
paused
and
sighed
bitterly
and
your
mother
i
suggested
experimentally
she
was
an
invalid
for
several
years
before
i
left
home
replied
alf
his
tone
fulfilling
my
anticipation
have
you
ever
noticed
that
the
prodigal
son
of
real
life
in
nineteen
cases
out
of
twenty
speaks
spontaneously
and
feelingly
of
his
father
with
perhaps
a
dash
of
reverent
humour
whereas
to
quote
menenius
he
no
more
remembers
his
mother
than
an
horse
this
is
cruel
beyond
measure
and
unjust
beyond
comment
but
sad
to
say
it
is
true
and
the
platitudinous
for
the
sake
of
verisimilitude
as
well
as
of
novelty
should
make
a
memo
of
it
amongst
all
the
of
my
acquaintance
i
can
only
think
of
one
whose
mother
unseen
presence
is
a
power
and
her
memory
a
holy
beacon
shining
with
a
decidedly
intermittent
light
unfortunately
a
glance
along
the
three
yet
to
come
shows
me
that
this
nobly
spurious
type
of
the
shellback
vassal
of
runnymede
station
will
not
come
within
the
scope
of
these
memoirs
alf
dreamily
resumed
his
inconsequent
story
however
this
charley
cross
or
yankee
charley
was
an
old
victorian
digger
about
twelve
years
before
his
death
he
was
working
on
inglewood
with
a
mate
that
he
would
have
trusted
and
did
trust
to
any
extent
and
in
any
way
but
it
was
the
old
old
story
he
got
a
friendly
hint
and
watched
and
watched
for
weeks
without
betraying
any
suspicion
at
last
he
was
satisfied
then
he
carefully
laid
down
his
line
of
action
and
followed
it
to
the
end
one
day
his
mate
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
shaft
ready
to
put
his
foot
in
the
rope
suddenly
overbalanced
and
went
down
of
course
cross
was
close
beside
him
at
the
time
and
no
one
else
was
in
sight
cross
gave
the
alarm
and
in
the
meantime
went
down
the
rope
intending
like
bruce
to
sicker
for
the
shaft
was
only
about
forty
feet
deep
but
it
happened
that
the
man
neck
was
broken
in
the
fall
cross
forgave
his
wife
and
never
breathed
a
word
of
his
discovery
or
his
vengeance
but
in
spite
of
this
the
woman
seemed
to
live
in
fear
and
horror
during
the
next
couple
of
years
luck
favoured
him
and
he
made
an
independence
he
invested
his
money
judiciously
but
there
no
guarantee
for
domestic
happiness
in
fact
there
no
guarantee
for
anything
first
his
two
surviving
children
died
of
diphtheria
then
his
wife
followed
dying
cross
assured
me
of
a
broken
heart
he
sorrowed
for
her
more
deeply
perhaps
because
she
had
cost
him
so
dear
and
this
no
doubt
was
what
drove
him
to
drink
very
probably
i
replied
but
alf
this
taxing
of
your
mind
is
about
as
good
for
you
just
now
as
footballing
or
boxing
are
you
a
smoker
no
that
what
i
feared
now
take
my
advice
and
give
yourself
absolute
rest
while
i
boil
one
more
story
collins
as
well
authenticated
as
any
of
the
three
i
have
told
i
knew
a
young
fellow
of
between
and
thirty
this
wo
do
i
interposed
firmly
for
he
had
become
restless
and
excited
why
should
you
allow
your
mind
to
dwell
so
exclusively
on
the
manifestations
of
one
particular
phase
of
moral
aberration
and
to
do
bare
justice
to
womanhood
an
exceedingly
rare
one
except
among
the
very
highest
and
the
very
lowest
classes
unless
you
handle
such
questions
in
a
scientific
spirit
you
find
them
or
unfortunately
you
wo
find
them
envelop
your
reasoning
faculties
in
a
most
unwholesome
atmosphere
the
perpetual
brooding
over
any
one
evil
however
fatal
that
evil
may
be
naturally
the
mind
into
a
narrow
fanaticism
which
is
apt
to
condone
ten
times
as
much
wrong
as
it
condemns
and
you
drift
into
the
position
of
the
man
who
strains
at
the
moderate
drinker
and
swallows
the
usurer
we
see
this
in
the
good
templar
the
social
purity
person
the
trades
unionist
and
the
moral
faddist
generally
musonius
rufus
sternly
reminded
epictetus
that
there
were
other
crimes
besides
setting
the
capitol
on
fire
have
you
done
asked
alf
coldly
but
gently
let
me
tell
you
one
more
story
while
i
able
i
soon
be
silent
the
man
i
thinking
of
was
a
owner
he
had
been
married
a
couple
of
years
and
had
one
child
i
could
say
that
he
actually
loved
his
wife
in
fact
she
was
a
woman
to
inspire
love
though
she
was
certainly
at
her
very
best
there
was
nothing
in
her
at
her
worst
she
was
ignorant
and
vain
and
utterly
unprincipled
no
not
exactly
unprincipled
but
she
was
essentially
low
if
you
understand
my
meaning
low
in
her
tastes
and
aspirations
low
in
her
likes
and
dislikes
low
in
her
thoughts
and
her
language
low
in
everything
she
may
not
have
been
what
is
called
a
bad
woman
but
that
miserable
want
of
i
ca
understand
how
would
you
give
me
another
drink
please
he
drank
very
little
this
time
he
had
been
speaking
with
an
effort
and
a
haggard
hopeless
look
was
intensifying
in
his
face
i
began
to
suspect
a
temporary
delirium
the
presentiment
of
impending
death
was
unreasonable
though
not
ominous
so
also
with
the
determination
to
narrate
irrelevant
stories
but
the
incongruity
of
the
two
associated
notions
set
me
speculating
in
a
sympathetic
way
alf
said
i
gravely
it
foolish
to
tax
your
memory
for
anecdotes
now
try
if
you
can
settle
yourself
to
sleep
i
sure
i
have
great
pleasure
in
exchanging
yarns
with
you
at
some
future
time
when
you
more
fit
listen
collins
he
replied
sullenly
our
owner
got
the
inevitable
glimpse
of
the
truth
he
was
blind
before
now
he
was
incredulous
he
condescended
to
play
the
spy
and
he
was
soon
satisfied
this
time
it
was
a
government
of
the
local
court
a
blackleg
vagabond
with
interest
at
about
the
vilest
rat
and
certainly
the
rat
that
ever
breathed
the
breath
of
life
our
hero
took
no
further
notice
of
him
than
to
terrify
him
into
confession
and
drive
him
into
laying
the
blame
on
his
paramour
and
the
amusing
feature
of
the
case
was
that
she
finding
herself
fairly
run
to
earth
thought
she
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
turn
from
the
evil
of
her
ways
and
take
her
husband
part
against
the
other
fellow
but
no
no
our
hero
after
thinking
the
matter
over
took
her
into
his
confidence
without
giving
her
any
voice
in
the
new
arrangement
he
to
the
best
advantage
and
divided
the
proceeds
with
her
reserving
to
himself
enough
to
start
him
in
a
line
of
life
that
he
could
follow
without
the
annoyance
of
being
associated
with
anyone
all
that
he
earned
afterward
beyond
bare
expenses
he
forwarded
to
her
to
save
or
squander
as
she
pleased
the
only
condition
being
that
she
should
acknowledge
each
remittance
and
answer
as
briefly
as
possible
such
questions
as
he
chose
to
ask
she
humbly
assented
to
all
this
evidently
looking
forward
to
forgiveness
and
reconciliation
somewhere
or
eternity
but
by
god
she
mistook
her
mark
he
laughed
harshly
paused
and
resumed
one
restraint
upon
our
hero
was
the
thought
of
his
little
boy
only
old
enough
to
creep
about
and
incredibly
fond
of
him
though
this
never
softened
him
towards
the
worthless
cursed
mother
anyway
after
about
three
years
the
little
boy
died
and
his
heart
was
turned
to
stone
still
through
mere
bitterness
and
obstinacy
he
followed
the
course
he
had
adopted
meeting
with
a
run
of
success
that
surprised
himself
the
very
curse
that
was
on
him
seemed
to
protect
him
from
the
mishaps
that
befell
other
men
in
his
line
of
work
and
he
found
life
worth
living
for
the
sake
of
hating
and
despising
the
whole
human
race
including
himself
there
no
pleasure
like
the
pleasure
of
being
a
devil
when
you
feel
yourself
master
of
the
situation
and
now
i
done
collins
that
right
i
been
thinking
how
to
fix
things
for
you
till
you
able
to
first
i
have
one
question
to
ask
you
persisted
alf
you
notice
that
all
these
men
acted
differently
which
of
them
acted
right
or
did
any
of
them
you
know
there
are
two
other
courses
open
to
appeal
to
the
law
or
to
pass
the
matter
over
quietly
for
fear
of
scandal
is
either
of
these
right
one
course
must
be
right
and
all
the
others
must
be
wrong
by
this
time
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
humour
him
well
i
replied
it
happens
that
i
have
given
the
subject
some
thought
as
i
intend
if
i
can
find
time
to
write
a
few
words
on
the
varied
manifestations
of
jealousy
in
the
shakespear
plays
you
familiar
with
the
plays
of
course
i
read
bits
of
them
possibly
you
remember
then
that
posthumus
in
cymbeline
on
receiving
proofs
of
his
wife
infidelity
we
know
her
to
be
loyal
but
that
does
affect
his
proofs
harbours
not
one
thought
of
revenge
toward
the
man
who
has
supplanted
him
indeed
as
an
artistic
illustration
of
iachimo
immunity
from
retribution
posthumus
is
afterward
represented
as
disarming
and
sparing
him
in
battle
a
concession
he
would
have
made
to
an
ordinary
enemy
he
looks
to
imogen
alone
nothing
but
the
sacrifice
of
her
life
will
satisfy
him
on
the
eve
of
the
same
battle
we
find
him
though
seeking
for
death
himself
still
gloating
over
the
handkerchief
supposed
to
be
stained
with
her
very
well
now
troilus
in
troilus
and
cressida
is
a
man
very
much
resembling
posthumus
in
temperament
brave
resolute
truthful
unsuspicious
and
more
liberally
endowed
with
muscle
than
brains
but
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
interrupted
alf
i
was
asking
your
opinion
as
to
which
of
the
four
acted
rightly
or
did
any
of
them
yes
alf
i
coming
to
that
i
was
going
to
remark
that
though
the
temperamental
conditions
of
posthumus
and
troilus
are
apparently
so
similar
apparently
mind
and
their
position
as
betrayed
husbands
so
identical
we
find
them
acting
in
directly
opposite
ways
troilus
entertains
no
thought
of
revenge
upon
his
faithless
wife
he
gives
his
whole
attention
to
the
now
let
us
glance
at
othello
here
is
a
man
who
allowing
for
his
maturer
age
is
much
like
the
briton
and
the
trojan
in
temperament
even
to
the
extent
of
being
more
liberally
endowed
with
muscle
than
but
you
not
answering
my
question
moaned
alf
which
of
the
four
acted
right
well
i
replied
i
afraid
my
conclusions
wo
have
the
rounded
completeness
we
value
so
much
in
moral
inferences
unless
i
allowed
to
empanel
leontes
in
the
winter
tale
as
well
as
othello
and
thus
work
from
a
solid
foundation
but
we
see
i
put
my
answer
in
this
way
a
casual
thinker
might
pronounce
it
impossible
to
lay
down
any
rule
of
conduct
here
on
account
of
necessary
diversity
in
conditions
he
would
perhaps
argue
that
though
abstract
right
is
absolute
and
unchangeable
the
alternative
wrong
though
never
shading
down
into
right
varies
immeasurably
in
degree
of
turpitude
so
that
the
action
which
is
intrinsically
wrong
may
be
more
excusable
in
one
man
than
in
another
or
under
certain
conditions
than
under
others
now
i
not
going
to
deny
that
it
lies
within
our
province
as
rational
beings
to
classify
wrongs
provided
we
do
so
from
a
purely
objective
i
shall
endeavour
to
deal
with
that
issue
i
merely
notice
stop
stop
interrupted
alf
rolling
his
head
from
side
to
side
answer
my
question
well
if
you
must
have
it
like
a
potato
i
give
my
vote
in
favour
of
potiphar
the
fourth
the
man
i
do
see
what
better
he
could
have
done
it
was
the
most
romantic
course
perhaps
but
i
not
a
romantic
person
rather
the
reverse
and
it
meets
my
approval
and
your
deliberate
conviction
is
that
he
acted
rightly
rightly
mind
assuredly
he
did
that
is
what
i
was
driving
at
but
now
you
have
to
take
my
conclusion
as
an
ipse
dixit
rather
than
as
a
theorem
the
misanthropy
of
the
gentleman
is
another
question
and
one
which
would
lead
us
into
a
different
and
much
wider
region
of
philosophy
but
i
think
we
find
it
interesting
to
trace
step
by
step
from
its
genesis
to
its
culmination
the
involuntary
process
of
thought
which
led
each
of
your
potiphars
separately
to
his
independent
action
we
ca
embark
on
this
inquiry
just
now
alf
for
we
shall
have
to
grapple
with
the
most
minute
and
subtle
shades
of
psychical
distinction
and
we
shall
have
to
deal
largely
in
postulates
for
though
i
want
to
tell
you
something
collins
interrupted
alf
in
a
tone
now
free
from
all
trace
of
the
distraction
and
constraint
which
made
it
painful
to
listen
to
him
like
poor
cross
i
feel
impelled
to
place
my
tragedy
on
record
but
in
one
man
memory
only
i
trust
entirely
to
your
discretion
did
you
know
i
was
a
married
man
no
i
certainly
did
i
replied
recalling
myself
for
i
had
been
to
a
sound
in
the
lignum
but
as
he
spoke
there
flashed
across
my
mental
vision
the
picture
of
his
wife
a
tigress
with
slumbrous
dark
eyes
a
circe
whose
glorious
voice
had
been
silent
in
death
for
ten
years
and
lost
to
him
for
three
years
longer
hence
by
some
sequence
worth
tracing
the
voluntary
exile
the
ishmaelite
occupation
the
morbid
malevolent
interest
in
the
messalinas
at
large
and
the
generally
pervading
smell
of
husks
this
let
me
tell
you
is
what
comes
of
meddling
with
tigresses
who
harass
a
man
out
of
individuality
and
then
die
or
abscond
leaving
him
like
the
last
cactus
of
summer
no
young
fellow
could
have
started
in
life
with
a
fairer
prospect
than
i
had
continued
alf
in
a
grave
composed
tone
but
i
was
guilty
of
one
deliberately
fiendish
and
heartless
action
and
following
upon
that
action
i
made
a
mistake
that
nothing
but
death
can
absolve
i
married
a
woman
who
i
believe
was
divinely
assigned
to
me
as
a
punishment
i
tell
you
the
whole
story
wait
alf
said
i
hastily
i
must
leave
you
for
a
few
minutes
do
you
want
anything
before
i
go
nothing
thank
you
do
stay
long
you
may
be
sure
i
wo
try
if
you
can
go
to
sleep
i
jumped
off
the
wagon
there
was
no
time
to
lose
during
the
last
few
minutes
a
peculiar
cadence
in
the
sound
of
alf
bells
had
told
me
just
as
surely
as
words
could
have
done
that
the
bullocks
were
mustered
and
travelling
away
my
horses
were
not
far
off
and
to
save
time
i
took
alf
saddle
and
bridle
from
under
his
wagon
as
i
did
so
i
heard
his
voice
low
and
monotonous
i
paused
o
molly
molly
my
girl
my
poor
love
my
darling
i
hurried
away
and
put
the
saddle
and
bridle
on
bunyip
body
o
me
i
thought
can
a
tigress
be
called
molly
this
must
be
seen
into
when
i
have
time
in
a
couple
of
minutes
bunyip
had
settled
down
to
that
flying
trot
which
would
have
been
an
independence
to
anyone
except
myself
after
clearing
the
lignum
i
got
a
back
elevation
of
the
bullocks
out
on
the
plain
and
rapidly
overhauling
them
i
perceived
that
i
should
have
to
pit
myself
against
the
chinese
boundary
rider
this
time
consequently
i
felt
like
cassius
fresh
of
spirit
and
resolved
to
meet
all
perils
very
constantly
out
of
my
way
you
manchurian
leper
or
i
run
over
you
i
shouted
gaily
as
i
swung
round
the
cattle
turning
them
back
remonstrated
the
unbeliever
drawing
his
horse
aside
to
let
them
pass

john
the
chinaman
had
turned
back
with
me
and
as
if
he
had
been
hired
for
the
work
was
stolidly
assisting
to
return
the
cattle
to
the
spot
whence
he
had
taken
them
why
do
you
speak
for
yourself
john
i
asked
thanklessly
quoting
from
the
familiar
hexameter
and
lighting
my
pipe
as
i
spoke
eulopean
dam
logue
responded
the
heathen
in
his
blindness
in
contradistinction
to
the
asiatic
and
the
australian
who
are
scrupulously
honest
i
observed
pleasantly

with
this
the
discomfited
mongol
turned
his
horse
in
the
direction
of
mondunbarra
homestead
and
like
a
driver
starting
an
engine
when
there
is
danger
of
the
belt
flying
off
gradually
worked
up
his
pace
to
a
canter
leaving
me
in
possession
of
the
field
but
in
cases
of
this
kind
there
is
only
one
thing
worse
than
victory
i
was
fairly
in
a
fix
with
alf
bullocks
you
must
understand
that
these
beasts
had
no
legal
right
to
be
anywhere
except
travelling
along
the
track
or
floating
down
the
river
if
they
scattered
off
the
track
not
being
attended
by
some
capable
person
their
owner
would
there
and
then
and
as
often
as
this
occurred
be
liable
for
trespass
twenty
times
a
day
if
you
like
and
a
shilling
per
head
each
time
if
i
wished
to
remove
them
across
a
five
or
paddock
the
only
way
i
could
legally
do
so
would
be
by
means
of
a
balloon
the
thousands
of
homeless
bullocks
and
horses
which
carry
on
the
trade
had
to
live
and
work
or
starve
and
work
on
squatters
grass
year
after
year
so
the
right
to
live
being
in
the
nature
of
a
boon
or
benefaction
went
largely
by
favour
like
the
slobbery
salute
imagined
by
poets
and
poor
alf
was
no
favourite
with
anyone
the
managers
of
all
these
three
stations
were
out
of
reach
and
besides
there
was
no
great
hope
in
appealing
to
any
of
them
yoongoolee
homestead
across
the
river
was
about
sixteen
miles
distant
and
hungry
from
what
i
knew
of
him
was
little
likely
to
make
concessions
to
any
member
of
the
guild
whose
representatives
had
selected
within
sight
of
his
yoongoolee
was
avoided
by
all
the
floating
population
of
the
country
and
particularly
by
those
who
could
afford
to
be
independent
forasmuch
as
there
was
nothing
there
but
highland
pride
and
highland
eczema
and
hunger
most
squatters
have
titles
had
two
which
were
used
indifferently
one
of
these
was
derived
from
the
hunger
the
other
from
the
eczema
and
of
all
alf
enemies
perhaps
the
most
inveterate
was
the
chinaman
boss
smythe
managing
partner
of
mondunbarra
this
gentleman
whose
exclusiveness
took
the
very
usual
form
of
excluding
all
considerations
not
tending
to
his
own
profit
and
whose
refinement
manifested
itself
to
the
vulgar
eye
chiefly
in
cutting
things
fine
about
the
station
had
a
couple
of
years
previously
taken
alf
in
the
very
act
of
running
one
of
his
own
bullocks
out
of
the
station
cattle
an
altercation
had
ensued
followed
by
a
summons
and
alf
had
been
mulcted
in
five
shillings
trespass
with
six
guineas
costs
besides
having
to
travel
seventy
or
eighty
miles
to
court
and
the
same
distance
back
to
his
wagon
this
was
trying
enough
to
a
man
of
alf
avaricious
and
irascible
bent
it
had
caused
him
to
speak
a
word
in
private
to
smythe
and
from
that
time
forward
the
squatter
hated
the
bullock
driver
considerably
more
than
he
hated
sin
and
feared
him
more
than
he
feared
his
reputed
maker
poor
smythe
the
remembrance
of
him
wrings
my
soul
with
pity
even
now
he
was
parsimonious
cunning
pusillanimous
fastidious
and
hysterically
excitable
he
was
cruelly
by
his
inexorable
partner
contemned
by
his
social
equals
hated
by
his
inferiors
and
popularly
known
as
the
marquis
of
canton
his
only
friend
was
his
brother
bert
a
quiet
youth
who
attended
him
with
and
his
appreciation
of
the
cheap
and
reliable
asiatic
was
passively
recognised
by
a
station
staff
of
there
was
no
use
in
my
appealing
to
this
gentleman
for
though
most
men
in
his
place
would
have
accepted
the
opportunity
of
laying
alf
under
an
obligation
i
knew
his
unhappy
moral
organisation
well
enough
to
be
certain
that
neither
policy
nor
magnanimity
could
intervene
on
behalf
of
a
prostrate
enemy
and
to
make
matters
more
hopeless
confucius
would
be
just
ahead
of
me
with
his
story
of
forcible
rescue
coupled
with
personal
threats
of
the
gravest
character
avondale
remained
this
station
belonged
to
that
grand
old
colonist
captain
royce
who
governed
the
seigneury
from
his
toorak
mansion
like
von
moltke
commanding
an
army
from
his
the
patriarchal
traditions
of
early
days
were
still
current
on
the
station
but
that
property
had
to
pay
and
pay
well
at
the
manager
peril
to
illustrate
this
captain
royce
in
responding
to
pastoral
interests
never
failed
to
remark
that
no
working
beast
had
ever
been
impounded
from
avondale
this
of
course
conveyed
the
impression
that
it
was
a
run
flowing
with
grass
and
water
for
distressed
teams
but
the
unhappy
manager
watched
and
reported
always
by
at
least
one
narangy
and
ground
as
you
see
between
the
upper
of
royce
the
munificent
and
the
nether
and
much
harder
one
of
royce
the
businessman
had
to
transmute
every
blade
of
grass
or
twig
of
into
a
filament
of
wool
or
let
somebody
else
have
a
try
consequently
the
boundary
riders
of
avondale
had
strict
orders
to
hunt
all
strays
and
trespassers
across
the
frontiers
of
stations
that
did
impound
so
the
fine
old
got
there
just
the
same
also
the
carriers
teams
and
the
drovers
horses
one
characteristic
of
avondale
was
that
the
rank
and
file
of
the
station
were
always
treated
with
fatherly
benevolence
and
were
never
discharged
they
gradually
got
useless
by
reason
of
mere
antiquity
and
without
actually
dying
slowly
mummified
and
were
duly
interred
in
the
cemetery
at
the
homestead
in
view
of
the
rigorous
usages
specified
it
was
no
marvel
that
a
deficiency
in
the
avondale
clip
of
had
led
to
the
resignation
of
angus
cameron
and
the
installation
of
a
new
manager
a
few
weeks
before
the
date
of
these
incidents
but
the
appointment
of
a
strange
boundary
rider
to
the
paddock
adjoining
alf
camp
an
event
which
had
taken
place
three
or
four
months
before
the
same
date
seemed
like
a
sudden
angle
and
break
in
the
corridor
of
time
avondale
was
nine
miles
distant
i
had
never
met
the
new
manager
but
his
name
was
wentworth
john
ffrench
and
by
all
accounts
he
acted
up
to
it
popular
rumour
likened
him
to
the
man
with
the
whole
pound
of
tobacco
who
had
sworn
against
borrowing
or
lending
ffrench
could
afford
to
be
independent
of
such
men
as
alf
but
could
afford
to
establish
a
precedent
for
invalided
carriers
loafing
on
the
run
of
course
you
would
look
at
the
thing
in
that
light
but
then
your
name
is
not
wentworth
john
ffrench
and
you
would
do
for
a
manager
of
avondale
you
would
have
the
run
swarming
with
a
most
tenacious
type
of
trespassers
before
you
knew
what
you
were
doing
moreover
the
moral
responsibility
if
any
of
the
matter
rested
on
mondunbarra
not
on
avondale
neither
had
i
ever
seen
the
new
avondale
boundary
man
but
i
was
prejudiced
against
him
also
it
required
no
deep
dive
into
the
mysteries
of
nomenology
to
augur
ill
from
the
nickname
of
tommy
the
title
was
of
course
satirical
the
man
an
imbecile
and
fickle
windbag
still
this
name
was
better
than
the
manager
evidently
my
only
chance
was
to
deal
directly
with
some
one
of
the
boundary
men
i
had
already
failed
to
melt
the
musing
briton
eyes
and
though
i
had
in
a
sense
prevailed
over
the
mongol
i
could
make
no
use
of
him
so
i
found
myself
hanging
as
you
might
say
by
one
strand
that
strand
being
terrible
tommy
i
must
enlist
this
man
i
mentally
concluded
as
a
willing
accomplice
and
by
my
faith
i
do
so
before
i
leave
him
i
care
not
an
he
be
the
devil
give
me
faith
say
i
by
this
time
the
sun
was
just
setting
i
left
the
bullocks
near
the
boundary
fence
turned
bunyip
adrift
and
placed
the
saddle
and
bridle
where
i
could
find
them
again
then
crossing
into
avondale
i
picked
my
way
through
a
belt
of
tall
lignum
sloppy
with
warm
water
and
alive
with
mosquitos
then
on
through
scattered
timber
until
a
mile
from
the
fence
appeared
the
abode
of
the
man
i
wanted
i
knew
where
to
find
the
place
having
stayed
there
one
night
when
bendigo
bill
was
in
charge
of
the
paddock
but
now
nearing
the
house
how
i
wished
i
had
that
frank
old
eureka
rebel
to
deal
with
instead
of
the
man
whom
i
saw
carrying
home
a
couple
of

of

our

interrupted
desperately
he
seemed
about

but
checked
himself
and
looked
at

absently
then
he
turned
to
the
fire
took
his

from

and
mechanically
measured
out
a
handful
of
tea
he
stood
gazing
into
the
fire
till
recalled
to
himself
by
the
boiling
of
the

then
a
triumphant
smile
invaded
his
stern

he
took
the

off

threw
the

into

clapped
both

on

tommy
was
now
laying
the
table
he
made
no
reply
to
my
rebuke
but
the
forced
and
deprecating
smile
which
struggled
to
his
face
showed
that
the
irresistible
had
scored
again
but
one
of
the
most
unpleasant
experiences
i
can
now
recall
to
mind
was
the
sitting
down
with
that
unsuspecting
to
his
and
cold
mutton
while
i
smiled
and
smiled
and
was
a
scotchman
the
easy
victory
tested
by
that
moral
we
all
carry
made
me
feel
as
mean
as
a
liveried
servant
and
when
tommy
requested
me
to
ask
a
blessing
and
sat
with
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
his
face
reverently
veiled
by
his
hand
whilst
i
wove
a
protracted
and
incoherent
grace
from
the
lowland
vocabulary
i
seemed
to
sink
to
the
level
of
a
prince
equerry
in
fact
i
would
almost
as
soon
make
one
of
a
crowd
to
hurrah
for
a
governor
as
go
through
such
an
ordeal
again
my
truthfulness
perhaps
the
only
quality
in
which
i
attain
an
insulting
seemed
outraged
to
the
limit
of
endurance
as
i
looked
forward
to
the
inevitable
detection
soon
or
late
of
the
impromptu
deception
which
in
spite
of
me
was
expanding
and
developing
like
a
or
an
election
squabble
however
i
contented
myself
with
directing
the
stream
of
conversation
and
leaving
the
rest
to
tommy
it
transpired
that
he
had
been
four
months
in
his
present
situation
and
only
nine
in
the
country
altogether
he
had
got
employment
on
avondale
by
a
lucky
chance
and
though
engaged
only
for
six
months
entertained
hopes
that
he
might
be
baptised
into
the
billet
to
the
permanent
exclusion
of
bendigo
bill
for
menial
employment
on
avondale
was
like
membership
in
a
church
only
that
to
the
carnal
mind
there
was
more
in
it
moreover
the
initiation
was
attended
with
greater
ceremony
and
the
possibility
of
expulsion
was
kept
further
in
the
background
once
admitted
into
avondale
fellowship
the
communicant
might
turn
out
a
white
sheep
or
a
black
one
but
he
was
still
a
sheep
whilst
all
outside
the
fold
white
or
black
as
the
case
might
be
were
goats
this
may
be
illustrated
by
the
incident
which
had
just
given
tommy
the
footing
of
an
unbaptised
believer
provisionally
admitted
amongst
the
elect
he
gave
me
the
account
so
far
as
it
affected
himself
and
bendigo
bill
sitting
on
the
same
long
afterward
narrated
the
episode
fully
two
years
before
the
date
of
this
record
bendigo
bill
mind
such
as
it
was
had
been
disturbed
by
the
discovery
of
gold
at
mount
brown
as
time
went
on
the
occasional
sight
of
drays
and
revived
the
old
lunacy
in
its
most
malignant
form
till
the
demoniac
at
last
gave
formal
notice
of
his
intention
to
leave
the
station
and
push
his
fortune
on
the
diggings
his
resignation
was
in
due
course
forwarded
to
captain
royce
whereupon
that
potentate
sent
him
a
peremptory
order
to
mind
his
paddock
and
not
make
an
infernal
exhibition
of
himself
the
demon
quaked
and
collapsed
for
the
time
and
bill
in
his
proper
person
acquiesced
with
the
humility
customarily
manifested
by
avondale
people
when
captain
royce
was
conducting
the
other
side
of
the
argument
but
the
evil
spirit
was
scotched
not
killed
and
bill
became
a
harmless
melancholic
dwelling
on
old
time
memories
of
the
diggings
and
gradually
lying
himself
into
the
conviction
that
if
he
had
gone
to
mount
brown
he
could
have
told
by
the
lay
of
the
country
unerringly
and
at
the
first
glance
where
the
gold
was
things
being
in
this
posture
there
reached
avondale
in
the
winter
of
a
vague
intangible
bruit
of
somebody
expecting
to
hit
it
on
mount
brown
and
shortly
afterward
bill
in
a
vision
of
the
night
found
himself
paddocking
a
bit
of
ground
for
a
free
lively
wash
running
something
like
ten
ounces
to
the
shotty
gold
next
night
the
dream
was
repeated
but
with
this
addition
that
the
dreamer
bent
the
point
of
his
pick
whilst
hooking
out
of
a
sort
of
pocket
in
the
pipeclay
a
flat
nugget
that
he
could
hardly
lift
the
third
night
found
the
ground
richer
than
ever
but
bill
knowing
it
to
be
a
dream
and
having
no
way
of
permanently
retaining
the
gold
he
might
get
under
such
conditions
very
wisely
contented
himself
with
taking
accurate
observations
of
his
landmarks
so
that
he
might
know
the
place
again
when
he
saw
it
by
daylight
whilst
so
engaged
his
attention
was
attracted
by
two
emus
which
resolved
themselves
respectively
into
captain
royce
and
mick
magee
the
latter
being
an
old
mate
of
his
own
accidentally
killed
on
the
jim
crow
about
fifteen
years
before
this
made
the
assurance
of
the
dream
triply
sure
for
the
emu
is
one
of
the
luckiest
things
a
person
can
dream
about
and
its
identification
with
captain
royce
was
as
good
as
an
old
boot
thrown
by
that
awesome
magnate
whilst
its
association
with
mick
magee
made
the
cup
of
blessing
overslop
in
all
directions
mick
having
been
in
the
days
of
his
vanity
a
man
that
brought
luck
with
him
wherever
he
went
particularly
in
shallow
ground
so
bill
wiped
from
the
tablet
of
his
memory
everything
except
the
picture
of
a
place
where
two
gullies
met
after
the
fashion
of
a
y
and
formed
a
bit
of
a
blind
creek
running
between
low
ranges
broken
here
and
there
by
the
outcrop
of
a
hungry
white
quartz
his
dream
intuitively
conveyed
the
further
knowledge
that
the
surrounding
country
had
been
prospected
for
a
few
floaters
and
the
creek
lower
down
for
bare
tucker
while
this
little
spur
of
made
ground
between
the
prongs
of
the
y
remained
intact
and
there
was
the
jeweller
shop
again
bill
emboldened
by
the
unholy
afflatus
caught
from
his
earlier
life
gave
notice
to
the
manager
this
time
following
up
his
action
by
buying
a
horse
and
from
a
and
conditionally
selling
his
own
two
horses
then
came
captain
royce
ukase
to
the
effect
that
no
man
must
be
allowed
to
swag
the
country
ragged
and
homeless
with
the
story
in
his
mouth
that
he
had
been
boundary
riding
on
avondale
for
ten
years
therefore
bill
notice
was
passed
over
with
the
contempt
it
merited
but
something
must
be
done
so
a
six
months
leave
of
absence
was
granted
and
the
manager
was
instructed
to
employ
for
that
time
only
the
first
stranger
who
presented
himself
the
latter
being
clearly
given
to
understand
that
he
was
only
in
the
loosest
sense
of
the
word
an
avondale
employe
if
bill
returned
on
the
expiration
of
his
furlough
he
should
be
reinstated
and
all
would
be
forgiven
if
he
failed
to
return
such
default
would
be
taken
as
evidence
of
contumacy
excommunication
would
promptly
follow
and
the
station
would
thereby
be
acquitted
of
all
responsibility
touching
any
destitute
old
bummer
who
might
swag
the
country
with
the
yarn
that
he
had
been
boundary
riding
on
avondale
for
ten
years
captain
royce
could
be
stern
enough
when
he
let
himself
out
the
of
the
dream
being
thus
partly
fulfilled
bill
clutched
at
a
release
in
any
form
and
it
happened
that
simultaneously
with
the
arrival
of
captain
royce
mandate
came
tom
armstrong
and
his
mate
andrew
glover
from
a
job
of
ringing
on
the
yanko
the
manager
being
named
angus
cochrane
plumped
tom
into
the
vacancy
and
supplied
him
with
a
couple
of
old
station
horses
bill
remained
a
few
days
longer
teaching
tom
the
routine
of
his
work
then
the
manager
and
bill
harnessed
his
horse
and
fled
northward
not
because
he
disliked
avondale
but
because
he
liked
it
so
well
that
he
was
impatient
to
make
captain
royce
such
a
bid
for
the
property
as
that
nabob
could
think
of
refusing
with
any
hope
of
luck
afterward
on
my
mentioning
alf
bullocks
tom
told
me
that
he
had
heard
bells
among
the
lignum
in
the
corner
of
mondunbana
a
few
nights
before
and
had
next
morning
found
twenty
bullocks
and
a
bay
horse
on
the
avondale
side
of
the
fence
he
knew
that
the
chow
had
passed
them
on
to
him
to
save
trouble
so
he
immediately
passed
them
back
to
the
chow
next
evening
his
neighbour
had
them
to
avondale
and
in
the
morning
tom
returned
them
to
mondunbarra
next
night
the
untiring
asiatic
had
them
back
on
avondale
and
in
the
morning
tom
did
what
he
should
have
done
at
first
put
them
across
the
river
on
to
the
station
from
whose
bourne
no
trespasser
returned
the
ensuing
adventures
of
the
bullocks
you
already
know
tom
had
acquired
without
any
severe
wrench
of
his
finer
feelings
the
boundary
man
hostility
to
the
bullock
driver
and
was
cultivating
the
same
with
all
the
energy
of
his
race
his
title
after
all
was
no
more
quizzical
in
its
application
than
that
of
ivan
the
terrible
and
to
understand
how
nasty
a
station
vassal
can
sometimes
make
himself
you
must
know
a
little
concerning
the
manners
none
and
customs
beastly
of
the
time
and
place
wherein
our
scene
is
laid
and
to
my
unspeakable
disgust
i
found
that
though
tom
had
never
met
alf
personally
the
unfortunate
outlaw
was
his
doctor
fell
too
and
the
very
spirit
of
leviticus
breathed
in
his
tone
as
he
informed
me
that
gin
he
had
umquhile
kent
the
nowte
belangit
tae
yon
raff
he
wad
hae
whummelt
them
owre
the

the
lachlan
a

o
my
country
lang
syne
an
no
fashit
himsel
wi
ony
sic
nothing
but
extreme
caution
would
do
here
the
brutal
truth
of
my
unwarranted
solicitude
for
the
sick
man
would
certainly
cause
friction
and
might
spoil
all
so
in
a
few
words
i
informed
tom
that
there
was
a
trifle
between
alf
and
me
and
he
was
sick
just
when
i
wanted
to
keep
him
on
his
feet
for
a
while
would
tom
and
my
patois
became
so
hideously
homely
that
for
the
reader
sake
i
have
to
paraphrase
it
would
tom
as
a
personal
favour
to
me
call
round
at
alf
camp
morning
and
evening
for
a
few
days
and
in
the
meantime
keep
his
bullocks
safe
no
answer
the
silken
bond
of
our
nationality
would
stand
such
a
strain
then
i
slowly
drew
out
my
and
with
the
stifled
sigh
of
a
thrifty
man
handed
my
compatriot
one
of
the
four
notes
which
excluded
me
from
the
state
of
grace
enjoyed
by
lazarus
remarking
that
he
could
be
expected
to
take
all
this
trouble
for
nothing
and
though
i
was
a
poor
man
like
himself
it
would
pay
me
to
get
alf
at
work
again
and
considering
that
a
bullock
driver
often
has
it
in
his
power
to
do
a
good
turn
for
a
boundary
man
would
it
be
better
i
suggested
for
tom
to
do
all
this
on
his
own
account
without
a
whisper
concerning
my
interposition
i
had
known
better
than
to
make
such
a
proposition
to
sollicker
that
impracticable
animal
who
would
have
uncovered
his
head
to
receive
backsheesh
as
backsheesh
from
a
would
have
spurned
my
lubricant
as
an
unholy
thing
and
woe
to
alf
bullocks
if
he
had
caught
them
again
but
i
was
surprised
to
find
my
modus
vivendi
accepted
by
this
passive
product
of
a
social
code
fabricated
and
compiled
in
the
nethermost
pit
a
code
which
under
the
heading
of
thrift
frankly
teaches
the
poor
to
grind
each
other
without
scruple
whilst
religiously
avoiding
all
inquiry
into
the
claims
of
the
rich
a
code
in
fact
which
makes
the
greasing
of
the
fat
pig
a
work
holy
unto
the
lord
the
keen
selfishness
of
my
proposal
touched
a
kindred
chord
in
poor
bosom
the
mettlesome
casting
of
my
sprat
upon
the
waters
in
sure
hope
of
finding
a
mackerel
after
many
days
awoke
his
admiration
whilst
an
immediate
and
prospective
advantage
to
himself
stood
out
through
it
all
yet
under
this
crust
of
clannishness
cunning
and
there
lay
a
fine
manhood
i
saw
the
latter
come
to
the
surface
a
few
months
afterward
but
that
is
another
episode
and
i
must
confine
myself
to
the
case
before
the
court
tom
knew
of
an
island
among
the
lignum
where
the
bullocks
would
be
safe
and
he
would
put
them
there
in
the
morning
after
he
had
visited
alf
but
i
must
take
the
bells
off
first
i
thanked
him
with
a
sincerity
out
of
all
keeping
with
my
accent
and
shortly
afterward
drew
the
intolerable
conference
gently
to
a
close
upon
the
whole
i
had
impressed
my
host
as
a
shrewd
person
too
much
with
the
cares
of
the
world
and
the
deceitfulness
of
riches
to
dwell
upon
personal
memories
of
the
auld
kintra
i
was
touched
to
notice
a
certain
disappointment
and
forlornness
in
his
manner
as
he
accompanied
me
to
the
boundary
fence
where
we
shook
hands
and
parted
each
looking
forward
to
the
probability
of
meeting
again
but
with
different
degrees
of
longing
and
now
thought
i
as
i
recovered
alf
saddle
and
bridle
heaven
grant
that
that
parting
may
be
a
kathleen
mavourneen
one
and
let
me
have
some
other
class
of
difficulty
to
deal
with
next
time
thus
in
the
best
of
spirits
owing
to
the
prospect
of
some
smooth
travelling
on
my
main
trunk
line
after
having
traversed
the
steep
and
crooked
section
to
which
i
had
been
committed
by
one
touch
of
the
switch
two
hours
before
i
made
my
way
through
the
lignum
to
alf
camp
guided
partly
by
the
instinct
which
we
share
unequally
with
the
lower
creation
and
partly
by
the
smell
of
the
dead
dog
on
the
night
air
after
dragging
the
poor
animal
body
a
little
distance
away
i
vaulted
into
the
wagon
and
spoke
cheerily
to
alf
no
reply
i
struck
a
match
and
saw
him
sleeping
the
peaceful
dreamless
sleep
of
a
tired
child
i
lit
a
bit
of
candle
i
had
noticed
in
the
daytime
and
sat
down
to
note
his
progress
in
a
professional
way
his
pulse
was
right
as
i
found
by
timing
it
with
my
own
and
the
hard
swelling
of
the
elbows
seemed
to
have
relaxed
a
little
the
backs
of
his
hands
were
pretty
bad
with
the
external
scurvy
known
as
rot
produced
by
unsuitable
food
and
extreme
hardship
but
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
complaint
which
had
so
strangely
overtaken
him
his
breathing
was
gentle
and
regular
though
his
face
was
covered
with
gorged
mosquitos
the
healthy
moistness
of
the
skin
showed
that
my
prescription
had
operated
as
a
sudorific
no
less
than
as
a
soporific
altogether
there
was
a
marked
diminution
of
what
we
call
febrile
symptoms
and
better
still
he
had
managed
to
turn
himself
over
since
i
left
him
i
lit
my
pipe
and
contemplated
the
unconscious
outlaw
without
being
aggressively
handsome
like
dixon
or
willoughby
alf
in
his
normal
state
was
a
decidedly
man
of
the
type
modified
hy
sixty
or
eighty
years
of
australian
deterioration
his
grandfather
had
probably
been
something
like
sollicker
and
the
apprehensions
of
that
discomfortable
cousin
were
being
fulfilled
only
too
ruthlessly
the
climate
had
played
old
gooseberry
with
the
fine
primordial
stock
physically
the
suffolk
punch
had
degenerated
into
the
steeplechaser
psychologically
the
chasm
between
the
stolid
english
peasant
and
the
saturnine
sensitive
australian
had
been
spanned
with
that
facilis
which
marks
the
descensus
averni
but
the
question
of
racial
degeneracy
past
present
or
to
come
troubled
its
victim
very
little
as
he
lay
there
indeed
it
had
never
troubled
him
much
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
can
not
learn
to
think
systematically
but
who
make
up
their
deficiency
by
feeling
the
more
intensely
and
now
that
the
unseen
guide
had
given
his
beloved
sleep
and
the
stern
defiant
blue
eyes
were
veiled
and
the
habitual
frown
smoothed
from
the
fine
forehead
i
found
something
pathetic
in
the
worn
repose
of
the
sleeper
face
presently
drifting
into
a
philosophic
mood
i
placed
my
propositions
in
order
and
by
the
inductive
system
applicable
in
such
cases
read
his
history
like
a
book
right
back
to
the
time
when
according
to
a
popular
though
rather
tough
assumption
he
had
lain
helpless
and
imbecile
on
his
mother
knee
clad
in
a
white
garment
about
four
feet
long
and
with
a
pulsating
soft
place
on
the
top
of
the
bald
head
which
wobbled
on
his
insufficient
neck
like
a
rose
on
a
weak
stalk
little
dreamed
that
mother
poor
mortal
when
with
tireless
iteration
she
ticked
off
his
extremities
pig
went
to
market
this
pig
stayed
at
home
little
did
she
dream
when
she
wiped
the
perpetual
dribble
from
his
mouth
when
she
poured
all
manner
of
unintelligible
into
his
inattentive
and
conspicuous
ears
little
did
she
then
dream
that
the
blind
evolution
of
events
would
transform
her
inexplicably
valued
baby
into
a
scrap
of
floating
wreckage
on
a
sea
of
trouble
scarcely
amounting
to
a
circumstance
in
the
vast
and
endless
procession
of
his
doubtless
he
would
soon
be
on
his
feet
again
but
to
what
end
merely
to
resume
the
old
persecuted
life
still
achieving
still
pursuing
that
strictly
congruous
penalty
which
waits
upon
the
man
whose
life
is
one
protracted
challenge
to
a
world
wherein
no
person
except
the
systematic
and
successful
hypocrite
has
too
many
friends
or
too
good
a
character
any
fool
can
get
himself
hated
if
he
goes
the
right
way
to
work
but
the
game
was
never
yet
worth
a
rap
for
a
rational
man
to
play
this
in
clear
view
of
the
fact
that
most
people
lose
more
by
their
friends
than
by
their
enemies
but
there
are
few
sins
more
odious
than
and
there
nothing
blessed
about
the
persecution
you
undergo
on
that
account
your
position
is
not
heroic
at
best
it
is
only
pitiable
at
worst
it
is
detestable
athanasius
contra
mundum
is
grand
only
in
cases
where
the
snag
is
right
and
the
mundus
wrong
then
persecution
becomes
the
form
of
blessedness
the
highest
form
of
course
being
the
ability
to
turn
round
and
the
persecutor
now
if
alf
could
open
the
windows
of
his
understanding
but
then
one
of
the
gravest
disabilities
in
the
leopard
of
or
thereabout
is
connected
with
the
changing
of
his
spots
such
is
life
with
these
reflections
i
extinguished
the
candle
and
left
the
wagon
the
bullocks
happened
to
be
close
by
after
the
manner
of
workers
they
had
collected
themselves
on
a
piece
of
open
ground
some
folded
asleep
head
to
flank
while
others
lay
chewing
meditatively
reviewing
the
events
of
the
day
and
wondering
what
the
morrow
might
bring
forth
amidst
the
reposing
group
stood
the
hardy
bay
horse
the
world
forgetting
by
the
world
forgot
for
contrary
to
popular
supposition
the
horse
has
not
half
the
innate
sagacity
of
the
ox
though
he
is
to
a
much
greater
extent
the
creature
of
habit
and
therefore
appears
more
teachable
by
the
light
of
a
good
now
declining
in
the
west
i
got
the
two
bells
off
without
much
trouble
and
threw
them
under
the
wagon
then
in
case
the
confucian
might
be
an
earlier
bird
than
the
lad
o
ecclefechan
i
put
the
bullocks
and
horse
across
the
boundary
fence
carefully
replacing
the
brush
i
had
removed
for
their
passage
from
there
i
struck
across
to
the
sound
of
cleopatra
bell
and
brought
my
two
most
useful
friends
to
where
the
most
valuable
was
still
in
ten
minutes
i
had
packed
my
share
of
the
things
that
make
death
bitter
and
in
another
i
had
left
mondunbarra
behind
and
was
well
into
avondale
working
out
in
my
own
mind
an
abstruse
ethical
problem
which
would
have
no
interest
for
the
reader
and
so
ends
the
day
but
not
the
narrative
i
am
mindful
of
my
promise
as
hour
after
hour
passed
the
insecurity
of
alf
situation
grew
upon
me
till
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
i
might
say
as
it
has
pleased
heaven
to
fashion
me
i
confess
i
could
arrive
at
no
definite
forecast
of
the
order
which
the
outlaw
affairs
would
assume
at
the
next
turn
of
the
kaleidoscope
but
i
knew
that
it
was
in
the
nature
of
the
kaleidoscope
to
turn
in
due
time
the
stars
dimmed
and
disappeared
the
of
the
sky
paled
to
a
greenish
tint
like
the
under
side
of
a
melon
changing
slowly
to
an
opaline
hue
then
imperceptibly
succeeded
a
blush
of
presently
shot
with
radial
bars
of
dusky
red
and
now
every
object
above
the
horizon
stood
vividly
revealed
through
the
limpid
air
soon
to
be
blurred
distorted
or
entirely
withdrawn
from
view
in
the
favourable
interval
of
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
i
saw
poondoo
homestead
six
or
eight
miles
ahead
in
the
intermediate
distance
appeared
a
moving
dot
which
as
i
was
travelling
at
a
walk
brought
my
into
use
only
an
man
in
a
pith
hat
driving
a
pair
of
chestnuts
in
a
buggy
no
business
of
mine
i
thought
in
my
human
and
i
was
lowering
the
glass
when
the
figure
of
another
traveller
crossed
its
field
this
last
was
a
person
bearing
a
startling
resemblance
to
mungo
park
inasmuch
as
he
was
evidently
a
poor
white
man
with
no
mother
to
bring
him
milk
no
wife
to
grind
his
corn
the
solitude
of
the
place
made
the
contrast
between
the
two
travellers
impressive
i
replaced
the
glass
thinking
with
sorrow
rather
than
conceit
that
i
could
make
a
better
world
myself
with
my
eyes
shut
there
was
no
irreverence
in
the
thought
the
irreverence
is
on
the
part
of
any
profane
reader
who
forges
the
creator
endorsement
to
that
good
old
rule
and
simple
plan
which
was
is
and
ever
shall
be
the
outcome
of
individualism
but
the
good
old
rule
as
you
shall
perceive
worked
happily
in
this
instance
now
try
to
imagine
a
writer
of
fiction
deliberately
inventing
an
incident
which
seems
to
strike
at
the
very
root
of
his
own
argument
then
you
will
have
some
idea
of
the
annalist
stern
veracity
as
opposed
to
the
mere
expediency
of
the
novelist
i
was
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
swagman
when
the
buggy
overtook
him
the
driver
drew
up
to
a
walk
apparently
yarning
with
mungo
and
i
nearly
tumbled
off
my
horse
when
i
saw
him
stop
on
the
off
lock
and
wait
whilst
the
swagman
deposited
bluey
on
the
and
himself
on
the
seat
then
the
chestnuts
tossed
their
heads
and
the
buggy
resumed
its
way
surging
across
the
like
a
canoe
on
rough
water
my
soul
went
forth
in
a
paean
of
joy
for
exactly
as
the
perfect
circle
of
a
flying
scrawl
bespoke
giotto
this
action
bespoke
stewart
of
kooltopa
now
masquerading
under
a
pair
of
strange
horses
here
was
my
opportunity
figuratively
i
would
put
alf
in
a
basket
with
a
note
pinned
to
his
bib
and
leave
him
on
stewart
those
whose
knowledge
of
the
pastoral
regions
is
drawn
from
a
course
of
novels
of
the
geoffrey
hamlyn
class
can
not
fail
to
hold
a
most
erroneous
notion
of
the
squatter
of
course
we
use
the
term
indifferently
to
denote
a
a
managing
partner
or
a
salaried
manager
lacking
generations
of
development
there
is
no
typical
squatter
or
if
you
like
there
are
a
thousand
types
hungry
is
one
type
smythe
petty
genteel
and
parsimonious
is
another
patriarchal
royce
is
another
yet
haughty
and
imperious
is
another
stewart
is
another
my
diary
might
just
as
likely
as
not
have
compelled
me
to
introduce
instead
of
these
a
few
of
the
remaining
and
type
conceivable
in
fact
except
the
overgrown
schoolboys
who
fill
henry
kingsley
exceedingly
trashy
and
misleading
novel
with
their
insufferable
twaddle
there
was
a
squatter
of
the
sam
buckley
type
but
he
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
word
went
to
beggary
and
being
too
plump
of
body
and
exalted
of
soul
for
and
too
comprehensively
witless
for
anything
else
he
was
shifted
by
the
angels
to
a
better
world
a
world
where
the
christian
gentleman
is
duly
recognised
and
where
socialistic
carpenters
vulgar
fishermen
and
all
manner
of
undesirable
people
do
the
stewart
it
must
be
admitted
was
no
gentleman
starting
with
a
generous
handicap
as
the
younger
son
of
a
wealthy
and
aristocratic
scottish
laird
he
had
during
a
colonial
race
of
forty
years
daily
committed
himself
by
actions
which
shut
him
out
from
the
fine
old
title
he
was
in
the
gall
of
altruism
and
in
the
bond
of
democracy
amiable
demeanour
unmeasured
magnanimity
and
spotless
integrity
could
never
carry
off
the
unpardonable
sin
in
which
this
lost
wallowed
the
taint
namely
of
isocratic
principle
when
a
member
of
the
classes
takes
to
his
bosom
that
unclean
thing
in
its
naked
reality
he
thereby
forfeits
the
title
of
and
becomes
a
mere
man
for
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
democratic
gentleman
the
adjective
and
noun
are
hyphenated
by
a
drawn
sword
if
the
said
unclean
thing
eats
into
its
victim
to
the
same
extent
that
the
wolf
did
into
baron
munchausen
the
metamorphosed
subject
comes
perilously
near
being
what
the
orientals
call
a
dog
of
a
christian
for
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
christian
gentleman
except
as
loosely
distinguished
from
the
buddhist
parsee
or
mahometan
gentleman
try
the
transposition
and
why
not
since
you
have
the
taking
the
shifty
insidious
title
in
its
sense
every
christian
is
prima
facie
a
gentleman
taking
it
in
its
sense
no
can
be
a
christian
for
christianity
postulates
initial
equality
and
recognises
no
gradation
except
in
usefulness
so
stewart
was
never
even
by
inadvertence
spoken
of
as
a
gentleman
always
as
a
christian
years
of
wise
choice
in
the
alternatives
of
life
had
made
the
golden
rule
his
spontaneous
impulse
and
now
though
according
to
the
theory
he
must
have
had
faults
no
one
in
riverina
below
the
degree
of
squatter
had
proved
sharp
enough
to
detect
them
it
was
considered
bad
form
to
express
approval
of
anything
he
did
oh
he
a
adj
christian
that
was
all
he
had
reached
a
certain
standard
and
was
expected
to
live
up
to
it
such
is
life
by
a
notable
coincidence
stewart
was
rich
not
owing
to
his
christianity
bear
in
mind
but
partly
to
a
faculty
for
knowing
by
the
look
of
a
sheep
as
it
raced
past
whether
the
animal
was
worth
or
seven
shillings
partly
to
his
being
able
to
tell
by
what
was
happening
in
some
other
quarter
of
the
globe
how
the
was
going
to
move
partly
to
his
being
connected
with
a
thing
that
paid
partly
to
his
knowing
when
he
was
well
off
and
leaving
the
reflected
meat
to
the
inverted
dog
in
the
water
partly
to
a
stubborn
crotchet
which
made
him
hold
the
giver
of
usury
as
well
as
the
taker
to
be
beyond
the
pale
of
mercy
partly
to
a
fine
administrative
ability
partly
to
the
avoidance
of
expensive
habits
partly
to
all
these
combined
but
chiefly
to
the
fact
that
his
mana
never
failed
anyway
he
could
afford
to
impart
in
judicious
assistance
to
deserving
and
undeserving
people
more
than
the
average
squatter
spends
in
usury
and
extravagance
put
together
and
be
better
off
all
the
while
an
illustration
may
not
be
amiss
here
i
tell
you
what
i
saw
in
the
miamia
paddock
on
kooltopa
during
the
autumn
and
winter
of
that
is
from
six
to
nine
months
before
the
date
of
this
discursive
yet
faithful
record
was
a
bad
year
the
scanty
growth
of
the
spring
had
been
eaten
off
nearly
as
fast
as
it
grew
and
afterward
the
millions
of
stock
had
to
live
like
the
melbourne
unemployed
of
later
times
on
the
glorious
sunshine
then
when
the
winter
came
it
brought
nothing
but
frost
and
the
last
state
of
the
country
was
worse
than
the
first
the
stockroute
from
wilcannia
to
hay
was
strewn
with
carcases
of
travelling
sheep
along
the
whole
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
on
one
part
of
the
route
some
frivolous
person
had
stooked
the
dried
mummies
they
were
lying
so
thick
in
order
that
drovers
and
boundary
men
might
have
the
pleasure
of
cantering
on
ahead
to
run
the
little
mobs
out
of
the
way
and
as
human
nature
thus
sold
never
grudges
to
others
participation
in
the
sell
the
stooks
improved
in
size
and
for
weeks
and
months
i
remember
noticing
once
in
passing
along
the
stretch
of
that
route
which
bisects
the
one
tree
plain
that
taking
no
account
of
sheep
i
never
was
out
of
sight
of
dying
cattle
and
horses
let
alone
the
dead
ones
the
famine
was
sore
in
the
land
to
use
the
expression
of
men
deeply
interested
in
the
matter
you
could
flog
a
flea
from
the
murrumbidgee
to
the
darling
or
to
put
it
in
another
way
the
life
of
stock
in
riverina
was
as
cheap
as
the
life
of
the
common
person
in
the
novels
of
stevenson
rider
haggard
rudyard
kipling
and
some
other
modern
classics
kooltopa
being
the
best
of
land
and
lightly
stocked
was
an
exception
and
thither
flocked
nearly
all
the
uncircumcised
of
riverina
with
their
homeless
bullocks
and
horses
stewart
was
the
man
to
order
them
off
while
ordering
would
have
been
of
any
use
and
in
affairs
of
this
nature
the
squatter
who
hesitates
is
lost
the
time
comes
when
will
stand
a
lot
of
ordering
off
in
extreme
cases
such
as
the
one
under
review
they
are
about
equal
in
tenacity
to
the
scythians
or
the
cimbri
of
olden
times
there
was
no
end
to
them
week
after
week
month
after
month
they
came
from
localities
on
all
points
of
the
compass
some
with
sunburnt
wives
and
graduated
sets
of
children
the
latter
i
grieve
to
admit
distinctly
affirming
that
disquieting
theory
which
assumes
evolution
of
immigrating
races
toward
the
aboriginal
type
there
was
plenty
of
rough
feed
in
the
paddock
and
there
the
tribes
congregated
to
hold
their
protracted
feast
of
tabernacles
their
vast
which
they
by
no
means
conducted
on
religious
lines
for
the
easy
profanity
unconscious
obscenity
and
august
slang
of
the
back
country
scented
the
air
like
myall
whilst
the
aggregate
repertory
of
bonâ
fide
anecdote
and
reminiscence
was
something
worth
while
no
young
fellow
in
that
great
rendezvous
dared
to
embellish
his
narrative
in
the
slightest
degree
on
pain
of
being
posted
as
a
blatherskite
for
his
audience
was
sure
to
include
a
couple
of
critical
cynical
cyclopedias
of
everything
australian
everything
at
least
untainted
by
the
spurious
and
civilisation
of
the
littoral
an
evangelist
collecting
money
for
the
support
of
an
aboriginal
mission
went
fifty
miles
out
of
his
way
to
give
these
unregenerate
brethren
a
word
of
exhortation
this
good
man
he
probably
never
had
a
sovereign
which
he
regarded
as
his
own
and
rest
his
soul
he
needs
no
money
now
this
good
man
afterward
told
me
with
tears
of
gratitude
and
sorrow
in
his
eyes
that
he
got
a
fine
collection
in
the
but
no
souls
and
both
clauses
of
his
statement
seemed
to
have
the
ring
of
truth
stewart
sullenly
avoided
this
gathering
of
the
clans
he
knew
he
was
wanted
there
and
as
the
paddock
consisted
chiefly
of
purchased
land
he
felt
that
the
conventionalities
were
in
a
sense
violated
but
what
could
the
people
do
it
was
a
miserable
business
altogether
at
last
moved
by
the
report
of
the
boundary
rider
he
drove
slowly
along
the
river
frontage
and
saw
five
miles
of
wagons
wagonettes
buggies
tents
women
children
dogs
and
masculine
laundry
he
saw
fellows
patching
tarpaulins
mending
harness
making
yokes
platting
whips
fishing
reading
ouida
yarning
round
fires
or
trying
to
invent
some
new
form
of
gambling
but
he
only
saw
their
backs
and
they
did
see
him
at
all
he
took
a
tour
round
the
paddock
and
found
a
racecourse
duly
laid
out
in
a
suitable
place
with
a
few
fellows
training
their
bits
of
stuff
for
a
coming
event
others
were
in
the
swamps
and
others
after
turkeys
on
the
plains
whilst
a
few
diverted
themselves
by
coursing
rabbits
on
the
and
as
for
bullocks
and
horses
why
they
were
as
grasshoppers
for
multitude
a
closer
examination
brought
to
light
his
own
sheep
wild
and
shy
as
paddocked
merinos
always
are
these
had
withdrawn
to
the
quietest
places
they
could
find
and
were
there
making
the
best
of
a
bad
job
stewart
lost
his
temper
for
once
and
he
that
is
without
similar
sin
among
the
readers
of
this
simple
memoir
is
hereby
authorised
to
cast
the
first
stone
he
allowed
the
sun
to
go
down
upon
his
wrath
next
morning
he
rallied
up
all
his
station
hands
mustered
the
paddock
distributed
the
sheep
elsewhere
over
the
run
and
thus
washed
his
hands
of
all
responsibility
touching
the
welfare
of
his
guests
toward
spring
he
drove
round
the
camps
again
pausing
here
and
there
to
give
the
trespassers
a
bit
of
his
mind
boys
i
must
get
you
to
shift
lots
of
perishing
teams
not
able
to
get
down
out
of
the
back
country
till
now
and
all
making
for
this
paddock
must
leave
a
bit
of
grass
for
them
when
they
come
and
more
to
the
same
effect
so
the
settlement
gradually
and
things
returned
to
their
normal
monotony
but
not
altogether
so
some
of
the
nomads
wanted
land
and
had
means
to
back
their
desire
rambling
leisurely
over
the
station
paddocks
with
the
county
map
for
reference
these
people
saw
where
the
most
eligible
allotments
were
and
presently
picked
the
eyes
out
of
the
run
in
some
cases
shifting
straight
from
their
camps
to
their
selections
such
is
life
saint
peter
i
should
imagine
had
narrowly
watched
the
squatter
attitude
when
the
assyrian
came
down
like
a
person
flying
from
perdition
afterward
he
had
noted
with
approval
that
the
new
selectors
were
treated
with
the
same
forbearance
and
benevolence
they
had
formerly
experienced
as
refugees
but
not
until
he
saw
stewart
pounce
on
the
incident
of
the
mammoth
as
a
clinching
argument
against
did
that
austere
janitor
hang
his
keys
on
his
thumb
to
far
back
in
his
book
the
page
reserved
in
case
of
rich
men
and
still
the
metaphor
of
the
camel
and
the
needle
eye
stands
unimpaired
the
difficulties
vanish
only
when
you
attain
some
conception
of
what
the
kingdom
of
god
is
how
much
more
to
the
purpose
than
pearly
gates
or
jasper
seas
how
accordant
with
the
ormuzd
in
man
how
premeditated
in
design
how
indomitable
in
patience
and
how
needfully
and
inexorably
guarded
by
the
diminutive
portal
above
referred
to
good
morning
collins
good
morning
stewart
an
early
stirrer
by
the
rood
yes
i
have
a
sheol
of
a
long
stage
before
me
been
travelling
all
night
only
since
about
twelve
i
camped
yesterday
in
the
dead
man
bend
on
mondunbarra
i
been
kept
on
the
move
since
or
so
tell
you
how
it
came
i
was
lying
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
having
a
smoke
and
thinking
about
one
thing
or
another
when
i
heard
some
one
calling
from
the
other
side
of
the
river
it
was
mosey
price
and
he
told
me
stewart
sighed
glanced
toward
the
produced
a
took
thence
three
cigars
handed
one
to
me
and
another
to
mungo
park
lit
the
third
himself
then
smoked
listlessly
and
mechanically
good
he
remarked
throwing
away
the
stump
of
his
cigar
and
gathering
his
reins
what
your
name
he
continued
turning
to
the
swagman
bob
stirling
replied
the
african
explorer
i
worked
on
kooltopa
many
years
ago
but
i
do
suppose
you
remember
me
i
not
sure
however
i
find
a
nice
comfortable
week
work
for
you
at
all
events
collins
i
give
you
credit
you
should
have
gone
into
politics
you
have
made
a
d
d
good
diplomatist
i
glad
you
think
so
stewart
but
the
main
body
of
the
story
has
to
come
you
see
i
was
in
a
sense
no
farther
forward
than
at
first
alf
bullocks
were
only
respited
and
briefly
at
that
so
as
i
was
telling
you
i
left
them
against
the
boundary
fence
and
walked
across
to
interview
this
terrible
tommy
he
was
my
last
resource
i
just
met
him
carrying
home
a
couple
of
buckets
of
water
from
the
lagoon
sir
says
i
as
sweet
as
sugar
stewart
glanced
at
the
blazing
orb
now
slowly
climbing
the
coppery
sky
sighed
again
lit
another
cigar
and
smoked
impassively
d
d
if
i
approve
of
your
action
in
that
instance
collins
he
remarked
gravely
throwing
away
his
second
stump
and
groping
for
something
under
the
indeed
stewart
i
do
defend
the
action
i
only
endeavour
to
palliate
it
on
the
plea
of
necessity
and
if
adam
fell
in
the
days
of
innocency
what
should
poor
tom
collins
do
in
the
days
of
villainy
shakespear
observed
the
squatter
approvingly
as
he
drew
a
bottle
and
glass
from
a
under
the
seat
misquoted
though
unless
my
memory
betrays
me
but
i
look
at
the
thing
in
this
way
the
poondoo
people
put
a
couple
of
bottles
of
albury
into
the
buggy
and
i
think
we
can
do
one
of
them
now
early
as
it
is
when
shall
we
three
meet
again
eh
how
is
that
for
aptness
a
roland
for
your
adj
i
look
at
the
thing
in
this
way
collins
but
you
must
take
anything
on
an
empty
stomach
i
have
some
sandwiches
here
he
handed
a
couple
to
me
a
couple
to
bob
and
reserved
a
couple
for
i
look
at
the
thing
in
this
way
i
put
myself
in
tommy
place
now
if
any
man
presumed
to
play
such
a
trick
on
me
why
d
n
me
i
should
take
it
very
now
collins
o
stop
please
do
fill
that
glass
for
me
i
very
sensible
of
your
disapproval
stewart
i
more
sorry
than
i
can
express
not
in
the
way
of
penitence
certainly
but
that
i
should
be
unfortunate
enough
to
have
incurred
your
displeasure
i
wish
you
could
put
yourself
in
my
place
instead
of
well
long
life
to
you
stewart
both
for
your
own
sake
and
the
sake
of
the
public
thanks
for
the
good
wish
collins
and
to
sheol
with
the
flattery
i
may
tell
you
that
i
do
put
myself
in
your
place
as
well
as
in
tommy
but
d
n
it
you
do
seem
to
be
alive
to
the
principle
of
the
you
not
a
i
suppose
and
he
tendered
the
replenished
glass
to
bob
bad
hand
you
got
poor
fellow
severe
accident
apparently
sepoy
bullet
at
lucknow
sir
i
was
a
lad
of
nineteen
then
just
joined
you
been
a
soldier
yes
sir
i
was
an
ensign
in
the
queen
we
formed
part
of
havelock
column
of
relief
the
placid
unassertive
incapable
face
told
the
rest
of
the
poor
fellow
story
you
do
seem
to
be
alive
to
the
principle
of
the
thing
repeated
stewart
turning
again
to
me
your
cosmopolitanism
is
a
d
d
big
mistake
every
man
has
a
nationality
remember
and
though
you
find
many
most
excellent
fellows
of
all
races
yet
if
you
want
the
real
thing
you
must
look
may
god
bless
you
mr
stewart
murmured
stirling
of
ours
raising
the
glass
to
his
lips
thank
you
my
you
must
look
to
scotland
for
it
and
d
n
it
man
this
is
the
very
nationality
you
have
been
fleering
at
of
course
i
do
dwell
on
the
subject
because
i
happen
to
be
a
scotsman
myself
only
i
must
say
i
should
never
have
expected
but
what
do
you
think
is
the
matter
with
alf
morris
difficult
to
say
some
sort
of
arthrodynic
complaint
i
fancy
at
all
events
he
badly
gone
in
most
of
his
joints
poor
devil
soliloquised
the
squatter
filling
the
glass
for
himself
he
a
bad
lot
a
d
n
bad
lot
a
d
bad
lot
bitter
vindictive
sort
of
man
you
familiar
like
myself
with
shakespear
now
morris
reminds
me
of
titus
better
luck
boys
thank
you
mr
stewart
thank
you
mr
stewart
this
titus
as
you
may
remember
was
expelled
from
athens
by
the
people
after
they
had
elected
him
consul
they
could
stand
his
d
d
pride
he
took
up
his
abode
in
a
cave
and
for
the
rest
of
his
life
met
every
overture
of
friendship
with
taunts
and
insults
even
in
his
epitaph
written
by
himself
here
rests
his
head
upon
the
lap
of
earth
now
d
it
i
committed
those
lines
to
memory
ay
years
ago
i
wish
i
could
recall
them
i
think
i
can
repeat
the
passage
stewart
said
i
modestly
here
lies
a
wretched
corse
of
wretched
soul
bereft
seek
not
his
name
a
plague
consume
you
wicked
catiffs
left
here
lie
i
timon
who
alive
all
living
men
did
hate
pass
on
and
curse
thy
fill
but
pass
and
stay
not
here
thy
gait
good
replied
the
squatter
all
his
hurry
forgotten
in
the
fascination
of
profitless
gossip
now
there
you
have
morris
to
the
very
life
hopeless
d
d
case
but
the
misanthropy
of
the
shakespearean
hero
was
not
without
cause
stewart
i
urged
given
certain
rigorous
circumstances
acting
on
a
given
temperament
and
you
have
a
practically
inevitable
sequence
perhaps
a
pious
faith
perhaps
a
philosophic
calm
perhaps
an
intensified
selfishness
perhaps
a
sullen
despair
in
fact
the
variety
of
possible
results
corresponds
exactly
with
the
variety
of
possible
circumstances
and
temperaments
in
the
case
of
the
greek
misanthrope
the
factor
of
temperament
is
first
carefully
stated
then
the
factor
of
circumstances
is
brought
into
operation
then
the
genius
of
the
dramatist
supplies
the
resultant
revolution
of
moral
being
in
such
a
manner
as
to
excite
sympathy
rather
than
reprobation
reasoning
from
cause
to
effect
we
see
the
inevitableness
of
the
issue
but
in
morris
case
we
must
reason
from
effect
to
cause
we
see
a
certain
outcome
d
d
unmistakably
muttered
the
squatter
and
it
rests
with
us
to
account
for
this
from
prior
conditions
of
temperament
and
circumstances
then
we
shall
have
so
to
speak
the
second
and
third
terms
and
from
these
it
wo
be
difficult
i
think
to
calculate
the
term
which
should
antecede
them
namely
temperament
morris
is
a
widower
his
wife
was
a
magnificent
singer
and
in
a
general
way
one
of
those
tigresses
who
leave
their
mark
on
a
man
life
and
are
much
better
left
alone
has
he
any
children
asked
stewart
well
no
these
tigresses
do
have
children
anyway
she
died
some
ten
years
ago
but
at
the
time
of
her
death
they
had
been
separated
for
about
three
years
they
could
have
been
living
long
together
or
else
he
married
young
suggested
stewart
no
they
were
long
together
but
alf
is
a
man
of
peculiar
moral
constitution
he
frets
a
lot
over
her
memory
loves
and
hates
her
at
the
same
time
secondary
to
this
is
a
misunderstanding
with
his
father
which
caused
alf
to
clear
off
leaving
the
old
man
to
mind
everything
himself
of
course
i
only
giving
you
the
heads
and
my
information
is
derived
from
no
random
hearsay
but
is
obtained
by
an
intransmissible
power
of
induction
rare
in
our
times
thought
as
much
muttered
stewart
it
remains
then
i
continued
to
determine
the
temperament
which
acted
upon
by
these
circumstances
has
given
the
result
which
is
already
before
us
now
i
think
that
that
temperament
though
perhaps
tending
to
the
volcanic
must
have
been
a
sensitive
and
an
amiable
one
however
it
may
have
soured
and
hardened
into
misanthropy
and
avarice
we
ca
all
be
philosophers
mr
stewart
if
there
one
thing
i
hate
like
sheol
replied
the
squatter
gravely
it
is
the
quoting
of
scripture
as
against
my
but
d
n
it
we
are
told
that
the
righteous
man
turneth
away
from
his
righteousness
and
committeth
iniquity
all
the
days
of
his
vanity
which
god
giveth
him
under
the
sun
he
shall
be
likened
unto
a
foolish
man
that
built
his
house
upon
the
sand
you
know
the
rest
if
we
take
upon
us
to
judge
morris
at
all
we
must
judge
him
as
he
is
your
judgment
is
generous
but
nonsensical
mine
is
rational
but
churlish
d
churlish
he
paused
in
evident
discomfort
flicked
a
with
his
whip
and
continued
you
know
i
had
him
on
kooltopa
for
a
couple
of
months
bringing
in
pine
logs
when
barker
was
there
well
without
going
into
details
capable
fellow
too
fine
combination
of
a
cultivated
man
and
an
experienced
bushman
strictly
honest
also
i
think
only
for
his
d
nable
disposition
doctor
johnson
liked
a
good
hater
i
suggested
sadly
for
it
was
evident
that
my
unfortunate
protégé
had
already
in
his
own
peculiar
way
recommended
himself
to
stewart
you
can
imagine
by
that
circumstance
alone
what
a
strong
tincture
of
venom
was
held
in
solution
by
this
feeble
tenant
of
an
hour
indeed
if
the
matter
had
rested
with
the
squatters
they
would
have
starved
him
out
of
riverina
by
industrial
boycott
but
the
of
wool
and
the
of
goods
are
cares
that
as
a
rule
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
forwarding
firms
and
these
resemble
george
in
having
no
predilections
though
let
us
hope
the
similarity
ceases
here
hence
the
jolly
good
soul
of
a
carrier
with
lots
of
spring
in
him
the
man
who
seldom
buys
any
groceries
whose
breath
often
smells
like
broached
and
who
makes
a
joke
of
camping
for
a
few
weeks
with
a
load
on
his
wagon
is
very
naturally
passed
over
in
favour
of
the
misanthrope
who
neither
asks
nor
gives
quarter
and
the
personal
popularity
of
the
latter
with
his
own
guild
is

by
this
preference
doctor
johnson
be
d
d
replied
the
squatter
warmly
what
is
his
dictum
worth
what
the
sheol
entitled
him
for
instance
to
sneer
at
the
very
element
of
population
that
has
made
britain
a
nation
you
know
what
i
allude
to
now
speaking
with
strict
impartiality
it
strikes
me
d
forcibly
that
the
finest
prospect
england
ever
saw
is
the
road
that
leads
from
scotland
he
checked
himself
and
continued
in
a
gentler
tone
that
just
reminds
me
of
a
very
able
article
i
read
some
time
ago
i
think
it
was
in
blackwood
the
writer
proves
that
your
shakespear
must
have
imbibed
his
genius
to
a
great
extent
in
scotland
he
grounds
his
argument
partly
and
i
think
justly
on
the
fact
that
the
best
play
in
the
collection
is
a
purely
scottish
one
he
makes
a
d
strong
point
i
remember
of
the
expression
heath
from
whence
upon
this
blasted
heath
you
stop
our
way
making
night
hideous
and
so
forth
yes
i
replied
mechanically
and
then
avoiding
the
eye
of
the
grand
old
saint
and
hating
myself
as
a
buffoon
i
continued
my
own
conjecture
is
that
something
must
have
occurred
to
irritate
the
dramatist
whilst
he
was
writing
that
passage
and
the
expression
slipped
from
his
pen
unawares
never
replied
stewart
no
man
under
the
influence
of
petty
irritation
ever
wrote
anything
like
the
passage
where
that
expression
occurs
criticism
is
not
your
forte
collins
the
writer
i
speaking
of
sees
a
landscape
photographed
in
those
two
words
pardon
me
for
saying
that
your
talent
seems
to
run
more
in
the
line
of
acting
i
do
like
referring
to
it
again
but
d
n
it
all
my
interest
in
you
personally
makes
me
feel
very
strongly
over
your
interview
with
this
tom
armstrong
indeed
stewart
i
ca
tell
you
how
sorry
i
am
to
have
fallen
in
your
estimation
but
you
were
speaking
of
alf
morris
when
i
unfortunately
drew
you
from
the
subject
ay
to
return
to
morris
do
you
know
how
he
came
to
leave
the
bland
country
some
five
or
six
years
ago
well
yes
i
replied
reluctantly
rates
are
a
lot
higher
here
than
there
did
you
ever
hear
that
he
shot
anyone
a
boundary
rider
for
instance
the
kernel
of
truth
in
that
report
stewart
is
that
he
spoke
of
a
certain
boundary
rider
as
a
man
that
deserved
shooting
how
do
you
know
well
in
the
first
place
i
only
allowing
for
fair
average
growth
in
the
report
and
in
the
second
place
when
a
person
shoots
a
boundary
man
he
not
allowed
to
just
change
his
district
and
go
his
way
in
peace
sometimes
he
is
i
tell
you
how
it
happened
with
morris
and
the
man
who
had
a
profanely
long
stage
before
him
settled
into
an
easy
position
his
heels
on
top
of
the
and
his
arms
behind
the
back
of
the
seat
whilst
bob
held
the
reins
it
was
on
mirrabooka
brothers
had
owned
the
place
for
a
few
years
but
they
were
careless
and
intemperate
great
lovers
of
racehorses
and
d
d
extravagant
all
round
familiar
faults
with
people
named
i
remarked
you
perfectly
right
they
got
involved
and
had
to
sell
the
place
prescott
bought
it
and
it
was
about
a
month
after
he
had
taken
possession
that
the
thing
occurred
during
the
time
the
bullock
drivers
had
made
a
d
d
thoroughfare
of
the
run
zigzagging
from
one
tank
to
another
and
passing
close
to
the
home
station
prescott
determined
to
put
a
stop
to
this
he
locked
all
the
gates
on
the
track
and
secured
the
tanks
with
fences
and
kept
his
men
foxing
the
teams
day
and
night
and
along
with
all
this
he
prosecuted
right
and
left
d
d
hard
on
the
bullockies
of
course
and
far
from
generous
on
part
but
it
acted
as
a
check
and
in
a
couple
of
months
the
track
was
closed
for
good
however
just
in
the
thick
of
the
trouble
morris
crossed
the
run
and
of
course
fared
neither
better
nor
worse
than
the
rest
one
evening
he
was
seen
taking
down
a
fence
and
camping
at
a
new
tank
a
couple
of
miles
from
the
homestead
and
at
nine
or
ten
that
night
he
rode
up
to
the
station
and
asked
to
see
prescott
when
prescott
appeared
morris
drew
him
aside
and
told
him
as
cool
as
a
d
cucumber
that
he
wanted
to
make
a
deposition
before
him
as
a
magistrate
to
the
effect
that
he
had
just
shot
a
man
for
attempting
to
remove
his
bullocks
prescott
refused
to
take
the
deposition
just
then
but
he
had
a
pair
of
horses
put
in
a
wagonette
and
took
the
storekeeper
with
him
to
accompany
morris
to
where
the
thing
had
happened
when
they
got
there
d
n
the
sign
of
a
body
could
they
find
but
morris
showed
them
the
spot
and
strictly
charged
them
to
note
it
well
then
he
refused
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
the
d
d
business
and
went
after
his
bells
while
prescott
and
the
other
fellow
returned
to
the
station
cooeeing
and
listening
as
they
went
they
overtook
the
man
on
the
way
with
a
revolver
through
his
arm
and
the
bullet
lodged
in
his
side
of
course
he
was
one
of
the
station
men
i
forget
his
name
at
the
present
moment
but
it
no
matter
when
they
got
the
chap
home
and
found
there
was
nothing
dangerous
prescott
had
his
horse
saddled
at
once
and
followed
the
track
till
he
came
to
morris
wagon
from
there
he
went
to
the
bells
and
found
morris
minding
his
bullocks
they
had
a
long
conference
and
prescott
went
home
next
morning
morris
continued
his
journey
and
when
he
unloaded
about
sixty
miles
this
side
of
mirrabooka
he
came
right
on
to
riverina
now
collins
you
put
a
d
d
big
value
on
your
acumen
and
your
sagacity
and
your
penetration
and
all
the
rest
of
it
what
do
you
make
of
that
story
mind
i
vouch
for
the
truth
of
it
there
a
hitch
somewhere
mr
stewart
confess
you
at
fault
d
n
you
i
am
at
fault
for
once
good
replied
the
squatter
complacently
now
i
give
you
the
key
when
the
sold
the
station
there
was
a
tank
nearly
finished
but
not
paid
for
and
somehow
d
d
if
i
know
how
people
can
make
such
blunders
somehow
this
tank
was
overlooked
in
the
valuation
prescott
considered
that
the
terms
of
sale
included
the
tank
the
liability
being
still
on
the
while
they
imagined
that
the
whole
transaction
was
taken
off
their
hands
if
the
truth
must
be
told
prescott
tried
to
do
a
sharp
thing
under
the
cloak
of
an
oversight
and
the
checkmated
him
with
a
d
d
sight
sharper
thing
in
this
way
their
last
action
while
the
station
remained
in
their
power
was
to
transfer
the
tank
to
the
department
on
condition
that
a
section
of
land
should
be
reserved
round
it
the
department
accepted
it
on
these
terms
and
struck
the
section
off
the
mirrabooka
assessment
but
prescott
got
wind
of
the
thing
before
it
was
gazetted
and
was
moving
heaven
and
earth
to
secure
the
reserve
just
at
the
time
morris
camped
there
how
morris
came
by
this
information
beats
the
devil
but
of
course
all
he
had
to
say
to
prescott
was
caught
some
d
d
scoundrel
stealing
my
bullocks
by
night
off
the
government
reserve
close
by
here
i
tried
without
effect
to
get
them
from
him
peaceably
and
i
was
compelled
to
stop
him
by
force
i
was
careful
to
ask
him
if
he
was
a
government
official
but
d
n
it
he
gave
me
an
insulting
answer
then
knowing
him
to
be
a
at
large
i
shot
him
in
the
act
of
felony
it
did
suit
prescott
to
the
question
of
the
reserve
just
at
that
what
the
sheol
could
he
do
and
in
any
case
morris
was
within
his
legal
rights
the
reserve
was
as
free
to
him
as
to
prescott
and
d
n
it
all
stock
must
be
protected
curious
case
altogether
of
course
prescott
afterward
got
the
land
secured
quietly
but
just
think
of
the
calculation
and
d
d
unscrupulousness
of
morris
he
a
man
to
be
avoided
collins
well
i
replied
baffled
and
hopeless
i
nothing
more
to
say
except
that
generally
speaking
the
man
who
ought
to
be
avoided
is
just
the
sort
of
person
that
my
own
refractory
nature
clings
to
with
the
which
makes
us
wondrous
kind
therefore
i
go
away
sorrowful
not
because
i
have
great
possessions
for
i
certainly
have
but
because
my
last
hope
for
alf
was
that
you
might
interest
yourself
in
his
present
difficulty
a
look
crossed
the
frank
face
of
the
fine
old
believer
followed
by
one
of
his
evanescent
frowns
why
d
n
it
man
have
i
arranged
that
already
with
bob
here
said
he
resuming
a
normal
position
on
the
seat
and
taking
the
reins
from
his
companion
hand
we
going
straight
to
the
dead
man
bend
never
you
fear
i
see
morris
through
i
never
forget
your
kindness
mr
stewart
nonsense
but
is
it
a
most
remarkable
thing
what
we
too
apt
to
call
a
mere
coincidence
here
i
find
bob
footsore
through
walking
in
bad
boots
and
while
i
wondering
what
in
the
devil
name
to
do
with
him
you
tell
me
of
morris
and
i
see
immediately
why
bob
was
placed
in
my
way
it
the
legislation
of
an
unsleeping
providence
short
of
it
we
meet
with
these
divine
adjustments
of
circumstances
every
day
of
our
lives
if
we
only
choose
to
recognise
them
thinking
over
these
things
makes
me
feel
devilish
small
in
my
own
eyes
but
all
the
more
confident
knowing
that
not
a
sparrow
falls
to
the
ground
without
oh
d
n
it
look
where
the
sun
has
got
to
i
might
see
you
again
i
sold

surely
not

going
to
queensland
they
tell
you
about
it

mr

chapter
v
trinidad
per
sam
young
conclave
on
the
evening
of
tuesday
the
i
had
called
officially
at
mondunbarra
homestead
no
one
was
visible
except
bert
smythe
the
managing
partner
younger
brother
who
was
leaving
the
store
with
a
ring
of
keys
on
his
finger
his
icy
response
to
my
respectful
greeting
revived
certain
memories
connected
with
the
chinese
boundary
man
and
warrigal
alf
bullocks
as
related
in
last
chapter
in
the
fewest
words
possible
bert
informed
me
that
smythe
was
in
melbourne
and
would
be
back
for
another
week
if
i
chose
to
leave
the
k
form
with
himself
it
would
be
filled
up
and
posted
to
our
central
office
immediately
on
smythe
return
which
would
save
me
the
trouble
of
calling
at
the
station
again
for
some
time
i
gave
him
the
k
form
and
he
was
moving
away
toward
the
barracks
when
i
asked
him
if
he
could
let
me
have
a
bob
worth
of
flour
and
a
bob
worth
of
tea
and
sugar
without
a
word
he
turned
back
to
the
store
and
supplied
the
articles
required
whilst
i
monologued
pleasantly
on
the
topics
of
the
day
when
i
inquired
where
i
would
be
likely
to
find
a
bit
of
grass
he
glanced
at
my
horses
and
i
honoured
him
for
the
evident
accession
of
sympathy
which
dictated
his
ready
reply
he
informed
me
that
the
only
available
grass
was
to
be
found
in
the
near
end
of
sam
young
paddock
and
proceeded
to
give
me
directions
that
a
child
might
follow
fixing
these
in
my
mind
i
went
round
by
the
to
solicit
from
the
tungusan
butcher
a
pluck
for
pup
and
altogether
by
the
time
i
reached
sam
young
paddock
night
had
imperceptibly
the
atmosphere
was
charged
with
smoke
probably
from
some
big
fire
among
the
spinifex
far
away
northward
and
a
nucleus
of
brighter
light
on
the
meridian
showed
the
position
of
a
gibbous
moon
yet
the
hazy
uniform
light
disciplining
the
eye
to
its
standard
seemed
rather
like
a
noonday
dulled
to
the
same
shade
the
temperature
was
perfect
for
comfort
so
i
fared
well
enough
whilst
with
respect
to
my
horses
i
could
only
hope
that
bert
had
been
unfaithful
to
his
chief
and
clan
now
for
the
record
of
wednesday
the
just
at
sunrise
one
glance
round
the
vicinity
brought
me
out
of
my
with
an
impression
that
there
was
nothing
but
roguery
to
be
found
in
villainous
man
the
country
on
all
sides
was
as
bare
as
the
palm
of
your
hand
and
my
horses
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
were
nibbling
at
the
stumps
of
breakfast
however
was
the
first
consideration
as
i
had
bothered
about
supper
on
the
previous
night
though
filling
my
at
a
tank
on
the
way
whilst
baking
a
of
such
inferior
quality
as
to
richly
deserve
its
designation
and
meanwhile
boiling
my
on
a
separate
handful
of
such
as
the
plain
afforded
i
found
myself
slowly
approached
by
a
chinaman
on
a
roan
horse
and
though
it
is
impossible
to
recognise
any
individual
chow
i
fancied
that
this
unit
bore
something
more
than
a
racial
resemblance
to
the
one
from
whom
i
had
recovered
alf
bullocks
moreover
he
was
riding
the
same
horse
mornin

how
me
that
peller
paul
dismounted
and
declining
my
meagre
hospitality
gave
me
copious
information
respecting
the
trinidad
the
nearest
corner
of
this
paddock
was
only
eight
miles
away
but
it
would
be
expedient
to
go
round
by
certain
tracks
making
the
distance
twelve
or
fourteen
miles
it
was
a
small
paddock
five
by
portion
of
a
five
by
ten
recently
divided
there
was
no
water
in
it
it
was
crossed
by
a
shallow
billabong
which
had
been
dammed
when
the
dividing
fence
was
erected
but
the
first
flood
in
the
lachlan
had
burst
an
opening
in
the
embankment
so
that
even
at
the
end
of
the
previous
winter
there
was
no
water
in
the
paddock
except
a
drop
of
sludgy
stuff
in
the
excavation
hence
the
grass
there
was
no
stock
in
the
trinidad
and
no
one
in
charge
there
were
two
station
men
with
a
team
of
bullocks
and
scoop
cleaning
out
the
dam
and
repairing
the
bank
but
they
would
see
anything
also
smythe
was
away
in
melbourne
and
would
be
back
for
another
week
of
course
it
took
me
about
to
champollion
all
this
information
from
the
cryptical
utterances
of
the
friendly
asiatic
you
allee
same
christian
i
remarked
packing
away
my
you

replied
not
without
dignity

long
time
clistian
name
splink
wattel
all
li
with
this
he
bade
me
a
civil
and
went
his
way
then
i
and
started
for
the
trinidad
mentally
placing
smythe
bert
and
myself
in
one
dish
of
the
moral
scale
and
this
undesirable
alien
in
the
other
with
an
unflattering
upshot
to
the
superior
race
and
this
conclusion
was
more
than
verified
when
i
reached
my
destination
the
grass
was
something
splendid
any
island
or
peninsula
of
plain
among
the
tall
lignum
would
do
for
a
camp
and
there
was
a
good
waterhole
about
a
mile
away
with
only
a
low
slack
fence
to
cross
between
one
thing
and
another
it
might
have
been
about
three
in
the
afternoon
when
with
pup
reposing
by
my
side
i
finally
settled
down
to
an
smoke
from
the
sage
meerschaum
often
deservedly
noticed
in
these
annals
the
two
greatest
pleasures
of
life
are
antithetical
in
operation
one
is
to
have
something
to
do
and
to
know
that
you
are
doing
it
deftly
and
honestly
the
other
is
to
have
nothing
to
do
and
to
know
that
you
are
carrying
out
your
blank
programme
like
a
good
and
faithful
menial
on
this
afternoon
the
latter
line
of
inaction
seemed
to
be
my
path
of
duty
even
to
the
extent
of
unharnessing
my
mind
so
that
when
any
difficulty
did
arise
i
might
be
prepared
to
meet
it
as
a
bridegroom
is
supposed
to
meet
his
bride
therefore
whenever
my
reasoning
faculties
obtruded
themselves
i
knapp
o
the
coxcombs
with
a
stick
and
cry
wantons
down
briefly
i
kept
my
ratiocinative
gear
strictly
quiescent
with
only
the
perceptive
apparatus
unrestrained
thus
observing
all
things
through
the
hallowed
haze
of
a
mental
sabbath
there
is
a
positive
felicity
in
this
attitude
of
soul
comparing
most
favorably
with
the
negative
happiness
of
nirvana
taking
it
easy
tom
conjectured
a
familiar
voice
no
steve
i
murmured
without
even
raising
my
eyes
tea
in
the
there
what
are
you
after
or
is
someone
after
you
prospecting
for
a
bite
of
grass
well
you
bottomed
on
the
wash
thought
you
were
out
to
kulkaroo
with
salt
just
getting
down
again
with
a
of
pressed
skins
bullocks
living
on
and
lignum
rode
over
to
get
the
geography
of
this
place
by
daylight
saunders
the
fencer
told
me
about
it
this
morning
he
got
a
contract
away
on
poolkija
and
he
going
out
with
three
horses
and
a
of
stores
for
himself
dray
stopped
on
the
road
for
the
last
week
with
his
wife
minding
it
horses
supposed
to
be
lost
in
the
lignum
on
yoongoolee
and
him
hunting
them
for
all
he
worth
keeps
them
planted
all
day
and
tails
them
here
at
night
he
would
have
laid
me
on
only
that
he
going
to
drop
across
them
morning
and
shift
anyone
coming
with
you
baxter
and
donovan
it
a
good
step
to
travel
must
be
ten
or
twelve
mile
but
this
grass
is
worth
it
safe
too
from
what
i
hear
might
get
two
goes
at
it
by
taking
the
bullocks
out
at
daylight
and
planting
them
till
night
however
i
must
get
back
to
meet
the
other
chaps
with
the
mob
well
i
be
here
when
you
come
thompson
turned
his
horse
and
disappeared
round
a
promontory
of
lignum
by
this
time
the
sun
was
dipping
dusky
red
toward
the
smoky
horizon
so
i
addressed
myself
to
the
duties
of
the
evening
which
consisted
in
taking
my
horses
and
pup
to
the
water
and
bringing
back
a
supply
for
myself
also
as
a
concession
to
the
new
aspect
of
things
i
took
the
bell
off
cleopatra
daylight
had
now
melted
into
soft
shadowless
moonlight
and
the
place
was
no
longer
solitary
dozens
of
cattle
were
scattered
round
harvesting
the
fine
crop
of
grass
and
thompson
with
his
two
confederates
joined
me
during
daylight
i
had
made
it
my
business
to
find
a
secluded
place
bare
of
grass
where
a
fire
could
be
kindled
without
offending
the
public
eye
and
to
this
spot
the
four
of
us
repaired
to
see
about
some
supper
before
the
first
match
was
struck
a
sound
of
subdued
voices
behind
us
notified
the
coming
of
two
more
interlopers
one
of
these
was
stevenson
a
now
on
his
way
northward
with
fresh
horses
fresh
by
the
way
only
in
respect
of
their
new
branch
of
industry
for
the
draft
was
entirely
of
condemned
coachers
from
hay
and
from
victoria
the
other
arrival
was
a
dutchman
who
brought
his
two
teams
a
thrifty
honest
sociable
fellow
he
was
yet
nothing
but
the
integrity
of
narrative
could
possibly
move
me
to
repeat
his
name
it
was
helsmok
with
the
sounded
long
the
first
time
i
had
addressed
him
by
name
many
years
before
a
sense
of
delicacy
had
impelled
me
to
shorten
the
vowel
also
to
slur
the
first
syllable
whilst
placing
a
strong
accent
on
the
second
but
he
had
corrected
me
just
as
promptly
as
smythe
would
have
done
if
i
had
called
him
smith
and
far
more
civilly
he
had
even
softened
the
admonition
by
explaining
that
his
strictness
arose
from
a
justifiable
family
pride
several
of
his
paternal
ancestors
having
been
captains
and
one
an
admiral
in
which
cases
the
name
would
certainly
seem
appropriate
but
some
continental
surnames
are
sad
indeed
the
of
germany
furnishes
perhaps
the
most
unhappy
examples
there
are
bonâ
fide
german
names
which
no
man
of
refinement
cares
about
repeating
except
in
a
shearers
hut
or
a
gentlemen
shadowed
you
chaps
remarked
stevenson
replying
to
the
bullock
look
of
inquiry
and
he
also
applied
himself
to
the
kindling
of
a
small
fire
jis
missed
my
ole
camp
by
about
ten
chain
cheerfully
observed
saunders
entering
the
arena
with
a
billy
in
one
hand
and
a
small
calico
bag
in
the
other
i
was
makin
for
her
when
when
i
heard
you
fellows
talkin

and
he
set
about
making
a

remarked
thompson
with
real
sincerity
it
an
infernal
name
for
children
to
hear
literally
so
commented
stevenson
alter
it
to
john
suggested
baxter
how

sighed
thompson
purposely
misconstruing
the
honest
vindication
and
it
have
the
same
effect
on
anybody
that
considers
it
properly
but
for
that
very
reason
it
not
a
decent
name
it
is
ein
olt
name
domson
argued
the
dutchman
old
enough
rejoined
thompson
gloomily
it
was
to
the
fore
when
satan
was
slung
out
of
heaven
and
it
be
going
as
strong
as
ever
when
we
trying
to
give
an
account
of
ourselves
it
wo
be
a
joking
matter
then
nor
was
it
any
longer
a
for
our
assembly
soon
however
the
billies
were
taken
off
the
fires
and
spiritual
apprehension
forthwith
gave
place
to
physical
indulgence
after
supper
we
adjourned
to
the
open
plain
the
night
was
delicious
and
for
the
congress
was
governed
by
that
dignified
silence
which
backcountry
men
appreciate
so
highly
yet
so
unconsciously
then
the
contemplative
quiet
of
our
synod
was
broken
by
the
vigorous
barking
of
saunders
dog
at
a
solitary
box
tree
indicating
a
possum
in
full
sight
gostruth
that
do
muttered
the
fencer
hastily
starting
toward
the
dog
that
visible
to
the
naked
eye
about
three
mile
on
a
night
like
now
recalls
the
most
perfect
pun
within
my
knowledge
remarked
stevenson
a
lady
travelling
by
coach
had
a
pet
dog
which
annoyed
her
till
one
of
them
remonstrated
surprised
that
you
do
like
my
dog
says
the
lady
a
real
peruvian
do
object
to
your
peruvian
dog
says
the
passenger
we
wish
he
would
give
us
less
of
his
peruvian
bark
before
our
company
had
recovered
from
the
painful
constraint
induced
by
this
unfathomable
joke
saunders
resumed
his
place
holding
the
dog
by
a
saddlestrap
taken
from
his
own
equator
dead
spit
of
my
poor
old
monkey
remarked
thompson
sadly
as
he
caressed
the
dog
never
felt
the
thing
that
on
me
more
distinctly
than
when
i
lost
poor
monkey
well
i
offered
you
a
fiver
for
him
rejoined
donovan
never
a
man
to
have
luck
with
a
thing
that
he
refused
a
good
bid
for
picked
up
a
bait
i
monkey
would
never
have
stayed
with
you
replied
thompson
that
dog
would
have
broke
his
heart
if
he
been
parted
from
me
tell
you
how
i
lost
him
last
winter
when
i
was
for
kenilworth
where
i
met
cooper
you
might
remember
it
was
dry
and
frosty
and
miserable
and
the
country
as
bare
as
a
stockyard
and
mostly
everybody
loafing
on
kooltopa
well
i
dodged
round
by
yoongoolee
stealing
a
bite
of
grass
here
and
a
bite
there
and
travelling
by
myself
so
as
not
to
be
worth
the
runs
and
staying
with
the
bullocks
every
night
and
keeping
them
in
decent
fettle
considering
so
one
evening
i
left
the
wagon
on
that
bit
of
red
ground
at
the
gate
and
tailed
the
bullocks
down
in
the
dark
to
sample
the
grass
in
old
sollicker
about
eleven
at
night
when
the
first
of
them
began
to
i
shifted
the
lot
to
an
open
place
so
as
to
have
them
all
together
when
they
got
full
i
was
in
bodily
fear
of
losing
some
of
them
among
the
lignum
in
the
dark
for
it
a
to
duff
in
a
horsepaddock
on
yoongoolee
i
knew
old
sollicker
was
as
regular
as
clockwork
and
i
was
safe
till
sunrise
so
i
intended
to
the
bullocks
just
before
daylight
to
lay
in
a
fresh
supply
in
the
meantime
i
settled
myself
down
for
a
sleep
where
was
the
adj
dog
asked
baxter
rolled
up
in
the
blanket
with
me
i
tell
you
and
we
both
slept
like
the
dead
owing
to
having
no
fleas
on
you
suggested
stevenson
do
know
what
was
the
cause
but
the
thing
that
woke
me
was
the
jingle
of
a
barwell
on
one
side
and
the
rattle
of
a
bridle
on
the
other
sure
enough
there
was
the
sun
high
and
old
sollicker
about
thirty
yards
off
and
here
on
the
other
side
was
his
two
horses
dodging
away
from
him
and
me
in
a
belt
of
lignum
between
and
my
twenty
bullocks
as
bold
as
brass
all
feeding
together
in
the
open
a
bit
to
the
left
of
the
horses
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
the
old
fellow
had
caught
sight
of
the
bullocks
on
account
of
the
belt
of
lignum
where
i
was
planted
but
he
was
making
for
an
openish
place
not
twenty
yards
ahead
of
him
and
when
he
got
there
it
would
be
all
up
so
i
grabbed
hold
of
monkey
and
fired
him
at
the
horses
he
was
there
he
went
like
a
boomerang
when
i
let
him
rip
and
in
two
seconds
he
had
the
blood
flying
out
of
those
horses
heels
and
of
course
they
streaked
for
the
clear
ground
near
the
hut
as
soon
as
i
let
the
dog
go
i
turned
my
attention
to
sollicker
at
the
first
alarm
he
stopped
to
consider
then
when
the
horses
shot
past
him
with
the
dog
eating
their
heels
he
rubbed
his
chin
for
about
two
minutes
and
me
trusting
providence
all
i
was
able
then
he
gave
a
sort
of
snort
and
said
i
be
dang
and
with
that
he
turned
round
and
went
toward
his
hut
that
was
the
signal
for
me
to
clear
and
in
fifteen
minutes
i
had
all
my
stock
in
poor
monkey
and
i
never
saw
him
from
that
day
to
this
you
adj
fool
why
did
you
hunt
for
him
asked
donovan
and
did
i
hunt
for
him
till
i
was
sick
and
tired
i
spent
half
that
day
hunting
for
him
and
next
morning
i
went
back
seven
mile
and
called
at
the
hut
to
ask
sollicker
if
her
old
man
had
seen
a
magpie
steer
with
a
bugle
horn
anywhere
among
the
lignum
and
when
i
got
clear
of
the
hut
i
whistled
till
i
was
black
in
the
face
and
still
no
dog
i
hunted
everywhere
and
still
no
dog
vanished
out
of
the
land
of
the
living
that
dog
would
never
leave
me
while
he
had
breath
in
his
body
and
when
he
did
come
back
after
he
had
chivied
the
horses
i
might
have
whispered
stevenson
and
following
the
direction
of
his
look
we
discerned
the
approaching
figure
of
a
man
on
horseback
ben
cartwright
observed
baxter
after
a
pause
anybody
else
comin
i
wonder
seems
like
as
if
people
could
fine
a
bit
o
grass
without
the
whole
adj
country
jumpin
it
i
move
that
all
trespassers
ought
to
be
prosecuted
with
the
utmost
vigour
o
the
adj
law
remarked
donovan
aloud
as
the
dismounted
and
liberated
his
horse
a
few
yards
away
we
should
certainly
be
justified
in
taking
the
opinion
of
the
court
on
a
test
case
added
stevenson
suppose
we
make
an
example
of
cartwright
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
for
the
intended
sacrifice
was
just
collapsing
into
an
easy
position
beside
the
speaker
been
scoutin
for
you
fellows
this
last
he
remarked
sociably
but
in
the
suppressed
tone
befitting
time
and
place
seen
samples
o
your
workin

an
know
who
to
expect
heard
the
dog
jis
now

we
got

ai
it
how
did
you
find

asked
thompson
know
jack

at
the
boree
paddick
about
four
mile
out
there
well
i
worked
on
his
las
night
an
he
follered
me
up
this
mornin
an
talked
summons
but
i
ai
very
the
way
things
is
jis
now
an
i
got
at
the
soft

o
the

an
he
laid

man
observed
thompson
so
long
as
you
do
interfere
with
his
own
paddock
he
never
makes
himself
nasty
my
own
experience
of
the
morning
led
me
to
endorse
this
judgment
wherefore
if
john
did
exactly
rise
in
the
estimation
of
the
camp
he
certainly
reduced
his
soundings
in
its
destestation
comin
down

asked
baxter

to
go
to

while
three
or
four
of
the
fellows
placed
their
eatables
before
cartwright
thompson
remarked
you
gave
me
a
bit
of
a
start
when
i
saw
you
coming
it
reminded
me
of
one
time
i
got
snapped
by
barefooted
bob
on
while
owned
the
station
for
all
the
world
such
a
night
as
moonlight
and
as
good
as
day
i
had
a
fearful
perisher
coming
down
with
the
last
wool
and
i
was
making
for
the
murray
by
myself
stealing
a
bite
of
grass
every
night
and
getting
caught
altogether
five
times
between
hay
and
barmah
well
i
knew
there
was
rough
feed
in
the
tin
hut
paddock
so
i
crawled
along
quietly
and
after
dark
in
that
timber
where
the
coolaman
hole
is
then
i
sneaked
the
bullocks
through
the
fence
and
out
past
that
bit
of
a
swamp
and
they
had
just
settled
down
to
feed
when
i
saw
some
one
riding
toward
me
got
possession
of
some
bullocks
close
handy
here
says
he
you
own
them
says
i
by
the
same
token
i
have
possession
you
are
says
he

if
you

i
just
stop
with

bullocks
till

them
out
of
the
paddock
so
we
stayed
there
yarning
all
night
and
in
the
morning
we
and
he
saw
me
out
of
the
paddock
nicest
civilest
fellow
you
meet
but
no
more
conscience
than
that
of
tom
he
and
bat
had
been
four
or
five
years
away
north
toward
the
gulf
and
had
just
come
down
used
to
keep
them
up
to
their
work
sent
them
away
somewhere
about
the
diamantina
shortly
after
this
affair
and
now
bob
speak
o
the
divil
growled
baxter
you
done
it
you
blatherin
fool
look
behine
you
now
there
a
bob
or
a
summons
for
every
individual
of
us
might
had
more
sense
thompson
as
you
will
remember
had
heard
of
bob
decease
but
had
since
learned
the
fallacy
of
the
report
i
was
therefore
probably
the
only
person
present
who
took
for
granted
that
obnoxious
familiar
was
so
removed
from
further
opportunity
of
mischief
as
to
leave
him
a
safe
subject
of
conversation
among
people
situated
as
we
were
hence
the
disquietude
of
the
company
was
nothing
in
comparison
with
my
own
perplexity
which
i
trust
was
no
less
successfully
disguised
for
it
was
bob
himself
who
had
just
ridden
round
a
contiguous
cape
of
lignum
and
now
dismounting
and
throwing
his
reins
on
the
ground
joined
our
unappreciative
group
after
folding
his
interminable
legs
in
two
places
and
clasping
his
hands
round
his
shins
this
excrescence
on
society
remarked
in
basso
profundo
evenin
chaps
evenin
came
in
sullen
but
general
response
then
baxter
queried
indifferently
same
ole
lay

the
deep
low
voice
every
man
to
his
work
my
mullockin
in
a
reservoy

the
leonine

deepened
to
hoarseness

in
the
shadder
of
a
lonely
rock

the
bible
says
i
buried

by
my

time

a
lot
o
difference
in

stewart
of

an
gits
there
an
he
got
the
heart
to
make
a
proper
use
o
what
money
travels
his
road
a
christian
then
there
smythe
his
mind
so
much
with

that
he
ca

as
he
did
pratt
from
boolka
i
asked

all
the
time
replied
bob
he
got
smythe
frightened
of
him
now
an
beginnin
to
hate
him
like
fury
besides
that
lay
smythe
be
dreamin
about
him
all
night
an
he
was
game
to
poison
him
all
day
an
when
he
feels
enough
haunted
make
him
an
offer
an
he
like
a
bird
i
should
be
inclined
to
reverse
the
situation
remarked
stevenson
i
should
make
him
glad
to
to
me
my
word
you
do
a
lot
replied
bob
i
seen
smarter
men
nor
you
through
tryin
to
work
points
on
the
same
ole
tell
you
what
i
seen
on
about
three
year
ago
jist
before
me
an
pore
bat
was
put
on
the
diamantinar
feller
name
o
tregarvis
from
bendigo
he
selected
a
lot
o
land
on
an
his
mind
he
straighten
bit
of
a
berryite
he
was
for
a
selector
too
an
he
done
a
big
business
back
an
forrid
to
vic
with
cattle
mixed
lots
of
course
with
stags
an
ole
cows
that
no
fence
would
hold
north
of
ireland
feller
name
o
moore
was
managin
at
the
time
an
was
a
good
deal
about
the
station
takin
a
sort
o
interest
in
this
tregarvis
well
things
was
so
arranged
that
the
cousin
jack
cattle
was
always
gittin
into
our
paddicks
an
the
rule
was
that
his
people
had
to
come
to
the
to
get
leaf
to
hunt
an
a
man
was
sent
along
o
them
as
a
percaution
an
generally
by
the
time
they
the
cattle
there
was
one
or
two
o
the
fattest
o
them
short
remedy
for
that
game
remarked
stevenson
i
should
have
laid
a
trap
jist
what
tregarvis
done
rejoined
bob
one
day
there
was
a
stranger
among
our
cattle
a
fine
big
white
bullock
an
tregarvis
brand
on
him
we
run
this
mob
into
the
yard
before
dinner
to
git
a
beast
to
kill
an
turned
all
out
agen
bar
the
white
one
but
he
was
in
the
all
the
afternoon
dusk
in
the
evenin
the
white
bullock
was
shot
an
jist
in
the
nick
o
time
when
the
head
was
slung
in
the
pigsty
an
the
hide
was
hangin
on
the
fence
raw
side
up
who
should
pounce
on
us
but
ole
tregarvis
an
young
tregarvis
an
a
trooper
no
mistake
moore
looked
a
bit
gallied
on
it
an
he
hum
an
ha
an
threatened
to
brain
tregarvis
if
he
laid
a
hand
on
the
hide
anyhow
the
trooper
took
charge
o
the
hide
an
both
the
tregarvises
struck
matches
an
examined
the
head
in
the
next
mornin
a
warrant
was
served
on
moore
but
of
course
he
was
bailed
then
the
come
on
an
tregarvis
swore
to
a
knowledge
that
a
white
bullock
of
his
was
among
the
cattle
an
he
give
evidence
about
the
findin
o
the
skin
an
swore
to
the
head
he
seen
in
the
an
young
tregarvis
he
swore
he
was
with
a
telescope
an
seen
a
white
bullock
o
theirs
yarded
with
some
more
an
all
the
rest
turnedout
an
he
kep
his
eye
on
that
white
bullock
all
the
afternoon
an
he
heard
the
shot
an
went
up
with
his
ole
man
an
the
trooper
an
he
seen
the
raw
hide
hangin
on
the
fence
an
the
head
in
the
an
a
couple
o
fellers
hoistin
the
carkidge
on
the
gallus
when
the
magistrate
asked
moore
if
he
wanted
to
make
a
statement
he
said
he
was
quite
bewildered
about
it
he
allowed
he
had
picked
the
white
bullock
for
killin
an
he
had
give
the
order
but
he
swear
the
beast
belonged
to
the
station
so
the
hide
was
spread
out
on
a
bit
o
tarpolin
in
the
floor
o
the
court
an
there
was
one
brand
on
it
an
that
brand
was
dmg
mind
you
this
is
what
i
was
told
my
orders
was
to
keep
clear
till
the
case
was
over
it
was
a
day
or
two
follerin
that
me
an
pore
bat
got
our
orders
for
the
diamantinar
anyhow
moore
whanged
it
on
to
tregarvis
for
malicious
prosecution
an
it
cost
the
cousin
jack
a
good
many
hundred
before
he
was
done
with
it
as
for
young
dick
tregarvis
he
got
four
years
for
perjury
so
they
be
jist
about
lettin
him
out
now
if
he
got
the
remission
beast
changed
suggested
thompson
yes
that
was
the
idear
some
different
dodge
next
time
changed
jist
at
dusk
an
shot
the
minit
after
i
had
the
station
bullock
all
ready
before
ever
tregarvis
one
was
yarded
dead
spit
o
one
another
down
to
the
shape
o
their
horns
bar
the
brands
of
course
treganis
beast
havin
nt
an
jh
conjoined
under
halfcircle
i
had
him
back
to
the
paddick
agen
when
tregarvis
thought
he
was
identifyin
him
in
the
so
he
simple
enough
an
between
one
thing
an
another
an
bein
like
the
last
dingo
on
a
sheep
station
ole
tregarvis
was
glad
to
to
before
all
was
over
yes
stevenson
lord
mercy
on
if
you
got
a
holt
of
him
my
word
where
the
adj
sheol
do
you
reckon
on
bein
shoved
into
when
you
croak
bob
asked
donovan
with
a
touch
of
human
solicitude
well
replied
bob
pointedly
as
he
unfolded
his
long
angles
to
a
perpendicular
right
line
i
got
good
hopes
o
goin
to
a
place
where
no
admittance
for
swearers
ai
ashamed
to
say
i
repented
eight
or
ten
months
ago
guarantee
you
fellers
ai
heard
no
language
out
o
my
mouth
since
i
set
down
here
nor
never
again
well
take
care
o
yourselves
chaps
and
without
further
farewell
bob
removed
his
lonely
individuality
from
our
convention
anointed
adj
savage
remarked
donovan
as
the
subject
of
his
comment
receded
into
the
hazy
of
the
plain
where
his
horse
was
feeding
uncivilised
person
added
baxter
well
yes
conceded
thompson
same
time
he
got
the
profit
of
his
unprofitableness
so
to
speak
hard
to
beat
him
in
the
back
country
you
have
to
be
more
uncivilised
than
he
is
and
i
saw
that
very
thing
happen
to
him
four
or
five
weeks
ago
out
on
goolumbulla
thompson
paused
experimentally
then
continued
yes
i
saw
him
till
he
must
have
felt
a
lot
too
tall
in
proportion
to
his
cleverness
another
tentative
pause
but
it
took
the
very
pick
of
uncivilisation
to
do
it
a
prolonged
pause
while
thompson
languidly
filled
and
lit
his
pipe
still
the
dignified
indifference
of
the
camp
remained
unruffled
thompson
might
tell
his
yarn
or
keep
it
to
himself
once
already
during
the
evening
his
tongue
had
run
too
freely
what
i
thinking
about
he
continued
in
a
tone
of
audible
musing
is
that
i
forgot
to
tell
bob
when
he
was
here
that
i
had
a
long
pitch
with
dan
three
or
four
nights
ago
boundary
man
on
goolumbulla
i
suggested
apathetically
got
acquainted
with
bob
years
ago
when
he
was
making
himself
useful
on
moogoojinna
and
bob
was
making
himself
obnoxious
on
or
boolka
no
they
never
met
till
four
or
five
weeks
ago
replied
thompson
with
inimitable
indifference
though
now
licensed
to
proceed
without
damage
to
his
own
dignity
dan
an
old
acquaintance
of
yours
is
he
i
heard
your
name
mentioned
over
the
finding
of
a
dead
man
george
something
had
been
fencing
on
mooltunya
george
murdock
yes
thompson
told
a
story
well
i
verily
believe
he
used
to
practise
the
accomplishment
mentally
as
he
sauntered
along
beside
his
team
he
knew
his
own
superiority
here
his
acquaintances
knew
it
too
and
they
also
knew
that
he
knew
it
hence
they
were
reluctant
to
minister
occasion
to
his
egotism
speaking
of
bob
he
continued
listlessly
i
met
him
in
the
hut
at
kulkaroo
on
the
evening
i
got
there
with
the
load
he
was
on
his
way
down
from
that
new
place
of
where
he
been
and
he
had
come
round
by
kulkaroo
to
see
one
of
the
very
few
friends
he
has
in
the
world
but
he
lost
his
labour
for
this
cove
had
left
the
station
more
than
a
year
before
however
we
had
been
yarning
for
hours
and
the
station
chaps
were
about
when
we
heard
someone
coming
in
a
hurry
no
less
than
webster
himself
first
time
he
had
been
in
the
hut
since
it
was
built
the
chaps
told
me
afterward
he
had
a
leaf
of
a
in
his
hand
and
says
he
lost
in
the
scrub
on
goolumbulla
dan
little
girl
five
or
six
years
old
anybody
know
where
there
any
blackfellows
nobody
knew
raise
horses
wherever
you
can
and
clear
at
once
says
he
man
for
the
next
couple
of
days
will
be
worth
a
regiment
very
shortly
as
for
you
thompson
says
he
your
own
master
of
course
i
was
only
too
glad
of
any
chance
to
help
in
such
a
case
so
i
went
for
my
horse
at
once
bob
had
duffed
his
two
horses
into
the
ration
paddock
on
his
way
to
the
hut
and
had
put
them
along
with
my
mare
so
that
he
could
find
them
at
daylight
by
the
sound
of
her
bell
this
started
me
and
him
together
he
lent
his
second
horse
to
one
of
the
station
chaps
and
the
three
of
us
got
to
goolumbulla
just
after
sunrise
first
of
the
crowd
mile
there
was
tucker
on
the
table
and
chaff
for
our
horses
and
during
the
twenty
minutes
or
so
that
we
stayed
they
gave
us
the
outline
of
the
mishap
seems
that
for
some
reason
or
other
valuation
for
mortgage
i
thinking
the
classer
had
come
round
a
few
days
before
and
spanker
had
called
in
every
man
on
the
station
to
muster
the
ewes
you
know
how
thick
the
scrub
is
on
goolumbulla
dan
came
in
along
with
the
rest
leaving
his
own
place
before
daylight
on
the
first
morning
they
swept
the
paddock
the
first
day
for
about
three
parts
of
the
ewes
the
second
day
they
got
most
of
what
was
left
but
spanker
wanted
every
hoof
if
possible
and
he
kept
all
hands
on
for
the
third
day
seems
the
little
girl
did
trouble
herself
the
first
day
though
she
had
seen
dan
in
the
morning
but
the
second
day
there
was
something
peculiar
about
her
not
fretful
but
dreaming
and
asking
her
mother
strange
questions
it
appears
that
up
to
this
time
she
had
never
said
a
word
about
the
man
that
was
found
dead
near
their
place
a
couple
of
months
before
she
saw
that
her
parents
did
want
to
tell
her
anything
about
it
so
she
had
never
showed
any
curiosity
but
now
her
mother
was
startled
to
find
that
she
knew
all
the
particulars
it
appears
that
she
was
very
fond
of
her
father
and
this
affair
of
the
man
perishing
in
the
scrub
was
working
on
her
mind
all
the
second
day
she
did
nothing
but
watch
and
during
the
night
she
got
up
several
times
to
ask
her
mother
questions
that
frightened
the
woman
the
child
did
understand
her
father
going
away
before
she
was
awake
and
not
coming
back
still
the
curious
thing
was
that
she
never
took
her
mother
into
her
confidence
and
never
seemed
to
fret
anyway
on
the
third
morning
after
breakfast
her
mother
went
out
to
milk
the
goats
leaving
her
in
the
house
when
the
woman
came
back
she
found
the
child
gone
she
looked
round
the
place
and
called
and
listened
and
prospected
everywhere
for
an
hour
then
she
went
into
the
house
and
examined
she
found
that
the
little
girl
had
taken
about
a
pint
of
milk
in
a
small
billy
with
a
lid
and
half
a
loaf
of
bread
then
putting
everything
together
the
mother
decided
that
she
had
gone
into
the
scrub
to
look
for
her
father
there
was
no
help
to
be
had
nearer
than
the
for
the
only
other
boundary
man
on
that
part
of
the
run
was
away
at
the
muster
so
she
cleared
for
the
station
twelve
mile
and
got
there
about
three
in
the
afternoon
not
able
to
stand
there
was
nobody
about
the
station
but
spanker
and
the
and
the
cook
and
the
chow
slushy
and
spanker
was
the
only
one
that
knew
the
track
to
the
however
they
got
a
horse
in
and
off
went
spanker
to
give
the
alarm
fine
woman
daughter
of
old
walsh
storekeeper
at
moogoojinna
on
the
deniliquin
side
it
would
be
about
five
when
spanker
struck
the
and
met
broome
and
another
fellow
then
the
three
split
out
to
catch
whoever
they
could
and
pass
the
word
round
dan
got
the
news
just
before
sundown
he
only
remarked
that
she
might
have
found
her
own
way
back
then
he
went
for
home
as
hard
as
his
horse
could
lick
as
the
fellows
one
after
another
spanker
sent
the
smartest
of
them
one
to
kulkaroo
and
one
to
mulppa
and
two
or
three
others
to
different
fencers
and
camps
but
the
main
thing
was
blackfellows
did
anybody
know
where
to
find
a
blackfellow
now
that
he
was
wanted
seems
there
had
been
about
a
dozen
of
them
camped
near
the
tank
in
the
for
a
month
past
but
they
were
just
gone
nobody
knew
where
and
there
had
been
an
old
lubra
and
a
young
one
camped
within
a
mile
of
the
station
and
an
old
fellow
and
his
lubra
near
one
of
the
boundary
men
places
but
they
all
happened
to
have
shifted
and
no
one
had
the
slightest
idea
where
they
could
be
found
however
in
a
sense
everyone
was
after
them
but
as
i
was
telling
you
we
had
some
breakfast
at
the
station
and
then
started
for
dan
place
seven
of
us
by
this
time
for
another
of
the
kulkaroo
men
had
come
up
and
there
were
three
in
a
buggy
this
was
on
a
thursday
morning
and
the
little
girl
had
been
out
hours
well
we
had
gone
about
seven
mile
with
crowds
of
fresh
horsetracks
to
guide
us
and
we
happened
to
be
going
at
a
fast
shog
and
bob
riding
a
couple
or
three
yards
to
the
right
when
he
suddenly
wheeled
his
horse
round
and
jumped
off
far
is
it
yet
to
dan
place
says
he
mile
says
one
of
the
just
on
the
corner
of
his
paddock
got
tracks
says
bob
run
them
up
while
you
fetch
the
other
fellows
somebody
look
after
my
horse
and
by
the
time
the
last
word
was
out
of
his
mouth
he
was
twenty
yards
away
along
the
little
track
no
trouble
in
following
it
for
she
was
running
the
track
of
somebody
that
had
rode
out
that
way
a
few
days
before
thinking
it
was
her
father
horse
poor
little
thing
apparently
she
had
kept
along
the
inside
of
dan
fence
the
way
she
had
generally
seen
him
going
out
till
she
came
to
the
corner
where
there
was
a
gate
then
she
had
noticed
this
solitary
horse
track
striking
away
from
the
gate
out
to
the
left
and
she
had
followed
it
however
brought
us
to
a
patch
of
hardish
ground
where
she
had
lost
the
horse
track
and
there
bob
lost
hers
presently
he
picked
it
up
again
but
now
there
was
only
her
little
bootmarks
to
follow
a
goot
dog
would
be
wort
vivty
men
dere
i
tink
suggested
helsmok
same
thought
struck
several
of
us
but
it
did
strike
bob
replied
thompson
fact
the
had
brought
a
retriever
with
them
in
the
buggy
a
dog
that
would
follow
the
scent
of
any
game
you
could
lay
him
on
but
they
could
get
him
to
take
any
notice
of
the
little
track
never
been
trained
to
track
children
and
how
were
they
going
to
make
him
understand
that
a
child
was
lost
however
while
two
of
the
were
persevering
with
their
retriever
the
other
fellow
drove
off
like
fury
to
fetch
dan
making
sure
that
we
would
only
have
to
follow
him
along
the
scent
in
the
meantime
i
walked
behind
bob
leading
both
our
horses
give
him
his
due
he
a
great
tracker
i
compare
tracking
to
reading
a
letter
written
in
a
good
business
hand
you
look
at
under
your
eye
you
must
see
a
lot
at
once
and
keep
a
general
grasp
of
what
on
ahead
besides
spotting
each
track
you
pass
otherwise
you
be
always
turning
back
for
a
fresh
race
at
it
and
you
must
no
more
confine
yourself
to
actual
tracks
than
you
would
expect
to
find
each
letter
correctly
formed
you
must
just
lift
the
general
meaning
as
you
go
of
course
our
everyday
tracking
is
not
tracking
at
all
however
bob
run
this
little
track
full
walk
mile
after
mile
in
places
where
i
would
see
a
mark
for
fifty
yards
at
a
stretch
on
account
of
rough
grass
and
dead
leaves
and
so
forth
one
thing
in
favour
of
bob
was
that
she
kept
a
fairly
straight
course
except
when
she
was
blocked
by
porcupine
or
then
she
would
swerve
off
and
keep
another
middling
straight
line
at
last
bob
stopped
where
she
slept
last
night
says
he
and
we
could
trace
the
marks
right
enough
we
even
found
some
crumbs
of
bread
on
the
ground
and
others
that
the
ants
were
carrying
away
she
had
made
twelve
or
fourteen
mile
in
the
day
walk
by
this
time
several
chaps
had
come
from
about
dan
place
and
they
were
still
joining
us
in
twos
and
threes
as
fast
as
they
came
they
scattered
out
in
front
right
and
left
and
one
cove
walked
a
bit
behind
bob
with
a
shaking
it
now
and
then
to
give
the
fellows
their
latitude
this
would
be
about
two
in
the
afternoon
or
and
we
pushed
along
the
tracks
she
had
made
only
a
few
hours
before
with
good
hopes
of
overtaking
her
before
dark
the
thing
that
made
us
most
uneasy
was
the
weather
it
was
threatening
for
a
thunderstorm
at
this
time
we
were
in
that
unstocked
country
of
the
station
suddenly
bob
rose
up
from
his
stoop
and
looked
round
at
me
with
a
face
on
him
like
a
ghost
help
us
now
if
we
do
get
a
blackfellow
quick
says
he
pointing
at
the
ground
before
him
and
sure
enough
there
lay
the
little
coppertoed
boots
where
she
had
taken
them
off
when
her
feet
got
sore
and
walked
on
in
her
socks
it
was
just
then
that
a
drove
up
with
dan
and
his
dog
in
the
buggy
poor
old
rory
i
interposed
much
excited
well
no
but
there
was
a
look
of
suspense
in
his
face
that
was
worse
and
his
dog
a
dog
that
had
run
the
scent
of
his
horse
for
hundreds
of
miles
all
put
together
that
dog
would
smell
any
plain
track
of
the
little
only
a
few
hours
old
and
would
wag
his
tail
and
bark
to
show
that
he
knew
whose
track
it
was
and
all
the
time
showing
the
greatest
distress
to
see
dan
in
trouble
but
it
was
no
use
trying
to
start
him
on
the
scent
they
tried
three
or
four
other
dogs
with
just
the
same
success
but
bob
never
lost
over
these
attempts
he
knew
anyway
it
was
fearful
work
after
that
with
the
thunderstorm
hanging
over
us
bob
was
continually
losing
the
track
and
us
circling
round
and
round
in
front
sometimes
picking
it
up
a
little
further
ahead
but
we
only
made
another
or
at
the
outside
before
night
was
on
i
daresay
there
might
be
about
of
us
by
this
time
and
eighteen
or
twenty
horses
and
two
or
three
buggies
and
wagonettes
some
of
the
chaps
took
all
the
horses
to
a
tank
six
or
eight
mile
away
and
some
in
desperation
to
hunt
for
blackfellows
and
the
rest
of
us
scattered
out
a
mile
or
two
ahead
of
the
last
track
to
listen
they
had
been
sending
lots
of
tucker
from
the
station
and
before
the
morning
was
grey
everyone
had
breakfast
and
was
out
again
but
do
what
we
would
it
was
slow
slow
work
and
bob
was
the
only
one
that
could
make
any
show
at
all
in
running
the
track
friday
morning
of
course
and
by
this
time
the
little
girl
had
been
out
for
hours
at
nine
or
ten
in
the
forenoon
when
bob
had
made
about
one
of
the
kulkaroo
men
came
galloping
through
the
scrub
from
the
right
making
for
the
sound
of
the
bell
bob
says
he
found
the
little
girl
billy
at
the
fence
of
peter
paddock
where
she
crossed
take
this
horse
about
two
mile
straight
out
there
i
had
my
horse
with
me
at
the
time
and
i
bob
to
the
fence
he
went
full
tilt
keeping
the
track
that
the
horse
had
come
and
this
fetched
us
to
where
a
couple
of
chaps
were
standing
over
a
little
billy
with
a
lump
of
bread
beside
it
she
had
laid
them
down
to
get
through
the
fence
and
then
went
on
without
them
the
lid
was
still
on
the
billy
and
there
was
a
drop
of
milk
left
the
ants
had
eaten
the
bread
out
of
all
shape
but
bob
was
through
the
fence
and
bowling
down
a
dusty
sheeptrack
where
a
couple
of
fellows
had
gone
before
him
and
where
we
could
all
see
the
marks
of
the
little
bare
feet
for
the
stockings
were
off
by
this
time
but
in
sixty
or
eighty
yards
this
pad
run
into
another
covered
with
fresh
since
the
little
girl
had
passed
nothing
for
it
but
to
spread
out
and
examine
the
network
of
pads
scattered
over
the
country
all
this
time
the
weather
was
but
there
was
a
grumble
of
thunder
now
and
then
and
the
air
was
fearfully
close
at
last
there
was
a
out
to
the
left
young
broome
had
found
three
plain
tracks
about
away
we
took
these
for
a
base
but
we
get
beyond
them
we
were
circling
round
for
miles
without
making
any
headway
and
so
the
time
passed
till
about
three
in
the
afternoon
then
up
comes
spanker
with
his
hat
lost
and
his
face
cut
and
bleeding
from
the
scrub
and
his
horses
in
a
white
lather
and
a
black
lubra
sitting
in
the
back
of
the
buggy
and
the
mulppa
tearing
along
in
front
giving
him
our
tracks
she
was
an
old
lubra
blind
of
one
eye
but
she
knew
her
business
and
she
was
on
the
job
for
life
or
death
she
the
track
at
a
glance
and
run
it
like
a
bloodhound
we
found
that
the
little
girl
had
kept
the
as
we
expected
generally
she
went
straight
till
something
blocked
her
then
she
go
straight
again
at
another
angle
very
rarely
hardly
ever
we
could
see
what
signs
the
lubra
was
following
but
she
was
all
right
uncivilised
even
for
an
old
lubra
nobody
could
yabber
with
her
but
bob
and
he
kept
close
to
her
all
the
time
she
began
to
get
uneasy
as
night
came
on
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
she
went
slower
and
slower
and
at
last
she
sat
down
where
she
was
we
judged
that
the
little
girl
had
made
about
seventeen
mile
to
the
place
where
the
lubra
got
on
her
track
and
we
had
added
something
like
four
to
that
though
mind
you
at
this
time
we
were
only
about
twelve
or
fourteen
mile
from
dan
place
and
eight
or
ten
mile
from
the
longest
night
i
ever
passed
though
it
was
one
of
the
shortest
in
the
year
eyes
burning
for
want
of
sleep
and
could
bear
to
lie
down
for
a
minute
wandering
about
for
miles
listening
hearing
something
in
the
scrub
and
finding
it
was
only
one
of
the
other
chaps
or
some
sheep
thunder
and
lightning
on
and
off
all
night
even
two
or
three
drops
of
rain
toward
morning
once
i
heard
the
howl
of
a
dingo
and
i
thought
of
the
little
girl
lying
and
far
more
helpless
than
a
sheep
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
if
she
came
out
safe
i
would
lead
a
better
life
for
the
future
however
between
daylight
and
sunrise
being
then
about
a
mile
or
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
bell
i
was
riding
at
a
slow
walk
listening
and
dozing
in
the
saddle
when
i
heard
a
call
that
sounded
like
it
seemed
to
be
straight
in
front
of
me
and
i
went
for
it
like
mad
had
gone
far
when
williamson
the
narangy
was
alongside
me
anything
says
i
says
he
like
i
think
it
was
out
here
think
it
was
more
this
way
says
i
and
each
of
us
went
his
own
way
when
i
got
to
where
i
thought
was
about
the
place
i
listened
again
and
searched
round
everywhere
the
bell
was
coming
that
way
and
presently
i
went
to
meet
it
leading
my
horse
and
still
listening
then
another
call
came
through
the
stillness
of
the
scrub
faint
but
beyond
mistake
there
was
a
trace
of
terror
in
the
tone
it
was
just
the
voice
of
a
child
deliberately
calling
with
all
her
might
seemed
to
be
something
less
than
away
but
i
could
fix
on
the
direction
and
the
scrub
was
very
thick
i
hurried
down
to
the
bell
everyone
there
had
heard
the
call
or
fancied
they
had
but
it
was
out
to
their
right
not
in
front
of
course
the
lubra
would
leave
the
track
nor
bob
nor
the
chap
with
the
bell
but
everyone
else
was
gone
dan
among
the
rest
the
lubra
said
something
to
bob
tumble
down
here
again
says
bob
very
weak
on
her
feet
plenty
tumble
down
it
was
pitiful
but
we
knew
that
we
were
close
on
her
at
last
by
this
time
of
course
she
had
been
out
for
hours
i
stuck
to
the
track
with
the
lubra
and
bob
we
could
hear
some
of
the
chaps
now
and
again
and
calling
bad
line
bad
line
muttered
saunders
impatiently
seemed
to
confuse
things
anyway
replied
thompson
and
it
was
very
doubtful
whether
the
little
girl
was
likely
to
answer
a
strange
voice
at
last
however
the
lubra
stopped
and
pointed
to
a
all
dusty
lying
under
a
spreading
she
spoke
to
bob
again
sleep
here
last
night
says
bob
and
that
was
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
spot
i
had
after
hearing
the
first
call
i
knew
it
by
three
or
four
tall
pines
among
a
mass
of
pine
scrub
however
the
lubra
turned
off
at
an
angle
to
the
right
and
run
the
track
not
an
hour
old
toward
where
we
had
heard
the
second
call
we
were
crossing
fresh
every
few
yards
and
never
two
minutes
but
what
somebody
to
ask
the
news
but
to
show
how
little
use
anything
was
except
fair
tracking
the
lubra
herself
never
saw
the
child
till
she
went
right
up
to
where
she
was
lying
between
two
thick
soft
bushes
that
met
over
her
and
hid
her
from
sight
asleep
i
suggested
with
a
sinking
heart
no
she
had
been
walking
along
less
than
before
and
she
had
brushed
through
between
these
bushes
to
avoid
some
prickly
scrub
on
both
sides
but
there
happened
to
be
a
close
in
front
and
she
fell
in
the
sort
of
trough
with
her
head
down
the
slope
and
that
was
the
end
of
her
long
journey
it
would
have
taken
a
child
in
fair
strength
to
get
out
of
the
place
she
was
in
and
she
was
to
the
last
ounce
so
her
face
had
sunk
down
on
the
loose
mould
and
she
had
died
without
a
struggle
bob
snatched
her
up
the
instant
he
caught
sight
of
her
but
we
all
saw
that
it
was
too
late
we
and
the
chap
with
the
bell
kept
it
going
steady
then
all
hands
reckoned
that
the
search
was
over
and
they
were
soon
collected
round
the
spot
now
that
little
girl
was
only
five
years
old
and
she
had
walked
nothing
less
than
miles
might
be
nearer
there
was
a
minute
silence
personal
observation
or
trustworthy
report
had
made
every
one
of
thompson
audience
familiar
with
such
episodes
of
new
settlement
and
for
that
very
reason
his
last
remark
came
as
a
confirmation
rather
than
as
an
nothing
is
more
astonishing
than
the
distances
lost
children
have
been
known
to
traverse
how
did
poor
rory
take
it
i
asked
dan
well
he
took
it
bad
when
he
saw
her
face
he
gave
one
little
cry
like
a
wounded
animal
then
he
sat
down
on
the
with
her
on
his
knees
wiping
the
mould
out
of
her
mouth
and
talking
baby
to
her
not
one
of
us
could
find
a
word
to
say
but
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
brought
to
ourselves
by
thunder
and
lightning
in
earnest
and
the
storm
was
on
us
with
a
roar
and
just
at
this
moment
webster
of
kulkaroo
came
up
with
the
smartest
blackfellow
in
that
district
we
cleared
out
one
of
the
wagonettes
and
filled
it
with
pine
leaves
and
laid
a
blanket
over
it
and
spanker
gently
took
the
child
from
dan
and
laid
her
there
spreading
the
other
half
of
the
blanket
over
her
then
he
thanked
all
hands
and
made
them
welcome
at
the
station
if
they
liked
to
come
i
went
for
one
but
bob
went
back
to
kulkaroo
direct
so
i
saw
no
more
of
him
till
poor
dan
he
walked
behind
the
wagonette
all
the
way
crying
softly
like
a
child
and
never
taking
his
eyes
from
the
little
shape
under
the
soaking
wet
blanket
hard
lines
for
him
he
had
heard
her
voice
calling
him
not
an
hour
before
and
now
if
he
lived
till
he
was
a
hundred
he
would
never
hear
it
again
as
soon
as
we
reached
the
station
i
helped
andrews
the
storekeeper
to
make
the
little
coffin
dan
would
have
her
buried
in
the
station
cemetery
she
must
be
buried
in
consecrated
ground
at
hay
so
we
boiled
a
pot
of
to
the
quality
of
pitch
and
dipped
long
strips
of
in
it
and
wrapped
them
tight
round
the
coffin
after
the
lid
was
on
till
it
was
two
ply
all
over
and
as
hard
and
close
as
ay
and
by
this
time
more
than
a
dozen
blackfellows
had
to
the
station
spanker
arranged
to
send
a
man
with
the
wagonette
to
look
after
the
horses
for
dan
the
child
mother
wanted
to
go
with
them
but
dan
refused
to
allow
it
and
did
so
with
a
harshness
that
surprised
me
in
the
end
spanker
sent
ward
one
of
the
narangies
i
happened
to
camp
with
them
four
nights
ago
when
i
was
coming
down
from
kulkaroo
and
they
were
getting
back
to
goolumbulla
however
added
thompson
with
sublime
lowliness
of
manner
that
what
i
meant
by
saying
that
in
some
cases
a
all
the
better
for
being
uncivilised
you
see
we
were
nowhere
beside
bob
and
bob
was
nowhere
beside
the
old
lubra
had
you
much
of
a
yarn
with
the
poor
fellow
when
you
met
him
i
asked
evening
and
morning
only
replied
thompson
maintaining
the
fine
apathy
due
to
himself
under
the
circumstances
i
was
away
all
night
with
the
bullocks
in
a
certain
paddock
did
recognise
me
but
i
told
him
i
had
been
there
and
then
he
would
talk
about
nothing
but
the
little
girl
catholic
priest
in
hay
sympathised
very
strongly
with
him
he
told
me
but
could
read
the
service
over
the
child
on
account
of
her
not
being
baptised
so
ward
read
the
service
his
people
are
english
catholics
most
likely
spanker
thought
of
this
when
he
sent
ward
dan
did
seem
to
be
as
much
as
you
expect
he
was
getting
uneasy
about
his
paddock
and
he
thought
spanker
might
be
at
some
inconvenience
but
that
black
beard
of
his
is
more
than
half
white
already
and
something
like
me
i
never
thought
of
mentioning
this
to
bob
when
he
was
here
absence
of
mind
bad
habit
this
dan
has
much
to
be
thankful
for
remarked
stevenson
with
strong
feeling
in
his
voice
suppose
that
thunderstorm
had
come
on
a
few
hours
sooner
what
then
there
was
a
silence
for
some
minutes
tell
you
what
made
me
interrupt
you
thompson
when
i
foun
fault
with
after
lost
kids
observed
saunders
at
length
instigation
o
many
a
pore
little
child
perishin
unknownst
seen
one
instance
when
i
was
puttin
up
a
bit
o
fence
on
grundle
hundred
an
chain
an
some
links
links
if
i
do
disremember
top
rail
an
six
wires
jist
cuttin
off
a
bend
o
the
river
to
make
a
handy
they
had
it
with
twelve
or
fifteen
years
before
but
when
they
got
it
purchased
they
naterally
for
a
proper
fence
an
you
ca
lick
a
top
rail
an
six
wires
with
panels
you
a
bit
of
an
authority
on
fencin
remarked
baxter
drily
well
as
i
was
sayin
continued
saunders
this
kid
belonged
to
a
married
man
name
o
tom
bracy
that
was
workin
mates
with
me
one
night
when
his
missus
drafted
the
lot
she
made
one
short
an
she
hunted
roun
an
called
an
got
excited
an
you
could
blame
the
woman
well
we
hunted
all
an
tom
an
cunningham
the
cove
that
was
engaged
to
cart
the
stuff
the
line
decent
chap
cunningham
is
but
a
sheol
of
a
liar
when
it
shoots
him
course
some
o
you
fellers
knows
him
man
but
one
o
them
hard
wiry
deepchested
deceivin
fellers
see
him
slingin
that
heavy
stuff
about
as
if
it
was
broad
palin
course
he
was
twenty
an
fellers
o
that
age
do
know
their
own
strenth
his
bullocks
was
fearful
low
at
the
time
on
account
of
a
trip
he
had
out
to
wilcanniar
with
flour
an
that
how
he
come
to
take
this
job
never
mind
cunningham
he
dead
now
observed
donovan
indifferently
well
as
i
was
tellin
you
pursued
saunders
we
walked
that
bend
the
whole
adj
night
singin
out
an
in
the
mornin
we
was
jist
as
fur
as
when
we
started
tom
he
to
the
station
before
daylight
to
git
help
an
by
this
time
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
kid
must
be
in
the
river
or
out
on
the
plains
i
favoured
the
river
a
lot
but
i
bethought
me
o
where
this
fence
had
bin
burnt
to
git
it
out
o
our
road
before
the
grass
got
dry
so
i
starts
at
one
end
to
examine
the
line
o
soft
ashes
that
divided
the
bend
off
o
the
plain
an
a
sign
o
traffic
across
it
yet
had
went
not
fifteen
chain
before
i
bumps
up
agen
the
kid
tracks
plain
as
a
b
c
crossin
out
towards
the
plain
for
cunningham
shows
him
the
tracks
an
the
two
of
us
follers
the
line
o
ashes
right
to
the
other
end
to
see
if
the
tracks
come
back
no
adj
tracks
so
we
tells
the
missus
an
she
for
the
plain
an
me
after
her
cunningham
he
collars
his
horse
an
out
for
the
plain
too
station
chaps
in
ones
an
twos
an
when
they
seen
the
tracks
they
scattered
for
the
plain
too
mostly
young
fellers
on
good
horses
some
o
them
good
enough
to
be
worth
enterin
for
a
saddle
or
the
like
o
that
curious
how
horses
was
better
an
cheaper
them
days
nor
what
they
are
now
i
had
a
brown
mare
that
time
got
her
off
of
a
traveller
for
three
notes
an
you
pass
her
by
without
lookin
at
her
but
of
all
the
deceivin
goers
you
ever
come
across
no
odds
about
the
mare
she
dead
long
ago
interposed
thompson
about
two
continued
saunders
cheerfully
i
was
an
an
i
went
back
to
the
tent
to
git
a
bite
to
eat
an
comin
back
agen
i
went
roun
to
have
another
look
at
the
tracks
now
thinks
i
what
road
would
that
little
wanderer
be
likeliest
to
head
from
here
an
i
hitches
myself
up
on
a
big
ole
black
log
that
was
about
a
chain
past
the
tracks
an
i
set
there
for
a
minit
like
sheol
you
would
call
it
a
big
log
for
the
murray
or
the
lower
but
it
was
a
log
for
the
murrumbidgee
i
seen
some
whoppin
redgums
in
gippsland
too
but
the
biggest
one
i
ever
seen
was
on
the
course
when
i
say
i
mean
measurement
i
ai
thinkin
about
holler
shells
with
no
timber
in
this
tree
i
speakin
about

eleven
thousand
two
hundred
an
some
odd
feet
o

the
feller
that

his
troubles

over
too
murmured
baxter
well
as
i
was
tellin
you
i
begun
to
fancy
i
could
hear
the
whimper
of
a
kid
far
away
thinks
fit
to
break
my
adj
neck
hears
it
agen
seemed
to
come
from
the
bank
o
the
river
away
i
goes
hunts
roun

agen
not
a
sound
couple
the
station
hands
happened
to
come
roun
an
i
told
well
after
an
hour
o
searchin
an
the
three
of
us
went
back
to
where
i
heard
the
sound
i
hitches
myself
up
the
log
agen
an
says
i
is
the
very
spot
i
was
says
i
i
heard
it
an
before
the
word
was
out
o
my
mouth
verb
me
if
i
did

says
they
lookin
as
wise
as

an
not
they
could
hear
it
but
for
an
all
they
parted
an
rode
roun
an
roun
as
slow
as
they
could
crawl
stoppin
every
now
an
agen
an
listening
for
all
they
was
worth
an
me
settin
on
the
log
puzzlin
my
brains
at
last
i
hears
another
whimper
you
are
again
says
i
an
one
cove
he
was
stopped
close
in
front
o
the
butt
end
o
the
log
at
the
time
an
he
jumps
off
his
horse
an
sticks
his
head
in
the
holler
o
the
log
an
lets
a
oath
out
of
him
fearful
feller
to
swear
he
was
i
disremember
his
name
jis
now
but
he
bin
on
grundle
ever
since
he
bolted
from
his
ole
man
place
in
bullarook
forest
on
account
of
a
he
got
an
it
was
hard
to
best
him
among
sheep
an
now
i
his
name
was
dick
dick
it
jist
on
the
tip
o
my
adj
tongue
no
matter
hees
name
interposed
helsmok
he
have
yoined
der
graat
mayority
too
well
as
i
was
sayin
continued
the
patient
saunders
we
at
the
mouth
o
the
holler
an
heard
the
kid
whinin
inside
an
when
we
to
him
he
was
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
an
we
struck
matches
an
tried
to
see
him
but
he
was
too
fur
along
an
the
log
was
a
bit
crooked
an
when
you
got
in
a
couple
o
yards
the
hole
was
so
small
you
wonder
how
he
done
it
anyhow
the
two
station
blokes
rode
out
to
pass
the
word
an
the
most
o
the
crowd
was
there
in
the
kid
was
a
good
thirty
foot
up
the
log
an
there
was
no
satisfaction
to
be
got
out
of
him
he
would
shift
an
we
come
to
the
impression
that
he
could
shift
an
at
long
an
at
last
we
had
to
chop
him
out
like
a
bees
nest
turned
out
after
that
the
little
stray
had
foun
himself
out
of
his
latitude
when
night
come
on
an
he
got
gumption
enough
to
set
down
where
he
was
an
wait
for
mornin
he
always
bin
told
to
do
that
if
he
got
lost
but
he
heard
boomin
bellerin
back
an
forrid
across
the
bend
in
the
dark
an
he
thought
the
an
the
bunyip
an
the
banshee
an
sheol
knows
what
all
was
after
him
so
he
foun
this
holler
log
an
he
thought
he
could
nt
git
fur
enough
into
it
he
was
about
seven
year
old
then
an
that
was
in
the
year
after
the
big
flood
an
the
shearin
was
jist
about
over
how
old
would
that
make
him
now
nineteen
or
twenty
he
left
his
ole
man
three
year
ago
to
travel
with
a
name
o
sep
halliday
an
he
bin
with
the
same
bloke
ever
since
mos
likely
some
o
you
chaps
knows
this
sep
stout
butt
of
a
feller
with
a
red
baird
used
to
mostly
take
flocks
for
truckin
at
deniliquin
but
that
got
too
many
at
it
like
everything
else
an
he
went
out
back
cooper
creek
way
with
three
thousand
gunbar
yowes
the
beginnin
o
las
winter
an
i
ai
heard
of
him
since
he
crossed
at
wilcanniar
no
wonder
i
observed
he
gone
aloft
like
the
rest
there
was
a
pause
broken
by
stevenson
in
a
voice
that
brought
constraint
on
us
all
bad
enough
to
lose
a
youngster
for
a
day
or
two
and
find
him
alive
and
well
worse
beyond
comparison
when
he
found
dead
but
the
most
fearful
thing
of
all
is
for
a
youngster
to
be
lost
in
the
bush
and
never
found
alive
or
dead
that
what
happened
to
my
brother
eddie
when
he
was
about
eight
year
old
you
must
remember
it
thompson
was
my
father
out
on
the
search
replied
thompson
tom
father
too
you
were
living
on
the
upper
campaspe
yes
continued
stevenson
clearing
his
throat
i
been
thinking
over
it
every
night
for
these
years
and
it
seems
to
me
the
most
likely
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
him
was
to
get
jammed
in
a
log
like
that
other
little
chap
then
after
five
years
or
ten
years
or
twenty
years
the
log
gets
burned
and
nobody
notices
a
few
little
bones
crumbled
among
the
ashes
i
was
three
or
four
years
older
than
eddie
he
resumed
hoarsely
and
he
just
worshipped
me
i
had
been
staying
with
my
uncle
in
kyneton
for
three
months
going
to
school
and
eddie
was
lost
the
day
after
i
came
home
we
were
out
gathering
gum
four
of
us
altogether
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
home
and
i
got
cross
with
the
poor
little
fellow
and
gave
him
two
or
three
hits
and
he
started
home
by
himself
crying
he
turned
round
and
looked
at
me
just
before
he
got
out
of
sight
among
the
trees
and
that
was
the
last
that
was
ever
seen
of
him
alive
or
dead
my
god
when
i
think
of
that
look
it
makes
me
thankful
to
remember
that
every
day
brings
me
nearer
to
the
end
the
spot
where
he
turned
round
is
in
the
middle
of
a
now
but
i
could
walk
straight
to
it
in
the
middle
of
the
darkest
night
yes
he
started
off
home
crying
we
all
went
the
same
way
so
soon
afterward
that
i
expected
every
minute
to
see
him
on
ahead
at
last
we
thought
we
must
have
passed
him
on
the
way
no
alarm
yet
of
course
but
i
was
choking
with
grief
to
think
how
i
treated
the
little
chap
so
i
gave
maggie
and
billy
the
slip
and
went
back
to
meet
him
i
knew
from
experience
how
glad
he
would
be
ah
well
the
time
that
followed
is
like
some
horrible
dream
he
was
lost
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
and
there
would
be
about
a
dozen
people
looking
for
him
and
calling
his
name
all
night
next
day
i
daresay
there
would
be
about
thirty
next
morning
my
father
offered
reward
for
him
dead
or
alive
and
five
other
men
guaranteed
each
next
day
my
father
reward
was
doubled
and
five
other
men
put
down
their
names
for
another
next
day
government
offered
so
between
genuine
sympathy
and
the
chance
of
making
the
bush
was
fairly
alive
with
people
and
everyone
within
thirty
miles
was
keeping
a
no
use
the
search
was
gradually
dropped
till
no
one
was
left
but
my
father
month
after
month
he
was
out
every
day
wet
or
dry
and
my
mother
waiting
at
home
with
a
look
on
her
face
that
frightened
us
waiting
for
the
news
he
might
bring
and
time
after
time
he
took
stray
bones
to
the
doctor
but
they
always
turned
out
to
belong
to
sheep
or
kangaroos
or
some
other
animal
of
course
he
neglected
the
place
altogether
and
it
went
to
wreck
and
our
cattle
got
lost
and
he
was
always
meeting
with
people
that
sympathised
with
him
and
asked
him
to
have
a
drink
and
you
can
hardly
call
him
responsible
for
the
rest
however
on
the
anniversary
of
the
day
that
eddie
got
lost
my
mother
took
a
dose
of
laudanum
and
that
brought
things
to
a
head
my
father
had
borrowed
every
shilling
that
the
place
would
carry
to
keep
up
the
search
and
there
was
neither
interest
nor
principal
forthcoming
so
the
mortgagee
wesleyan
minister
i
sorry
to
say
had
to
sell
us
off
to
get
his
money
we
had
three
uncles
each
of
them
took
one
of
us
youngsters
but
they
could
do
nothing
for
my
father
he
hung
about
the
getting
lower
and
lower
till
he
was
found
dead
in
a
stable
one
cold
winter
morning
that
was
about
four
years
after
eddie
was
lost
stevenson
paused
and
restlessly
changed
his
position
then
muttered
in
evident
torture
of
mind
think
of
it
while
he
was
going
away
crying
he
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
at
me
without
a
word
of
anger
and
he
walked
up
against
a
sapling
and
staggered
and
i
laughed
great
god
i
laughed
that
was
the
end
of
the
story
and
silence
fell
on
our
camp
doubtless
each
one
of
us
recalled
actions
of
petty
tyranny
toward
leal
loving
helpless
dependents
or
inferiors
in
strength
actions
which
now
seemed
to
rise
from
the
irrevocable
past
proclaiming
their
exemption
from
that
moral
statute
of
limitations
which
brings
in
course
of
time
for
an
innate
jehovah
sets
his
mark
upon
the
cain
guilty
merely
of
bullying
or
terrifying
any
brother
whose
keeper
he
is
by
virtue
of
superior
strength
and
that
brand
will
burn
while
life
endures
conversely
does
such
remorse
ever
follow
disdain
of
authority
or
defiance
of
power
i
for
one
have
never
experienced
it
soon
a
disquietude
from
another
source
set
my
mind
at
work
in
troubled
calculation
of
probabilities
at
last
i
said
would
you
suppose
steve
that
the
finding
of
george
murdoch
body
was
a
necessary
incitement
among
the
causes
that
led
to
the
little
getting
lost
domson
ascleep
murmured
helsmok
i
tink
dey
all
ascleep
i
wass

off

and
in
two
minutes
his
relaxed
pose
and
regular
breathing
affirmed
a
kind
of
fellowship
with
the
rest
in
spite
of
his
alien
birth
and
objectionable
name
but
i
could
sleep
dear
innocent
mary
perishing
alone
in
the
bush
nature
precious
link
between
a
squalid
past
and
a
nobler
future
broken
snatched
away
from
her
allotted
place
in
the
long
chain
of
the
ages
heiress
of
infinite
hope
and
dowered
with
latent
fitness
to
fulfil
her
part
now
so
suddenly
fallen
by
the
wayside
that
quaint
dialect
silent
so
soon
and
for
ever
vanished
from
this
earth
that
keen
eager
perception
that
fathomless
love
and
devotion
but
such
is
life
yet
it
is
well
with
her
and
it
is
well
with
her
father
since
he
throughout
her
transitory
life
spoke
no
word
to
hurt
or
grieve
her
poor
old
rory
reaching
goolumbulla
after
his
sorrowful
journey
his
soft
heart
would
be
stabbed
afresh
by
the
sight
of
two
which
i
had
posted
a
fortnight
before
and
how
many
memories
and
associations
would
confront
him
when
he
returned
to
his
daily
round
of
life
how
many
reminders
that
the
irremediable
loss
is
a
reality
from
which
there
can
be
no
awakening
how
many
relics
to
be
contemplated
with
that
morbid
fascination
for
the
of
a
slumbering
and
intolerable
sense
of
bereavement
but
the
saddest
and
most
precious
of
memorials
will
be
those
little
boots
that
she
left
along
the
way
deepest
pathos
lies
only
in
homely
things
since
the
frailness
of
mortality
is
the
pathetic
centre
and
mortality
is
nothing
but
homely
hence
no
relic
is
so
affecting
as
the
boots
of
the
dead
thus
in
the
funeral
of
that
trooper
when
i
was
but
little
older
than
poor
mary
the
armed
procession
the
dead
march
the
cap
and
sword
on
the
coffin
seemed
so
imposing
that
i
forthwith
resolved
to
be
a
trooper
myself
that
ambition
passed
away
but
the
pathos
of
the
empty
boots
reversed
in
the
stirrups
of
the
led
horse
has
remained
with
me
ever
since
from
sad
reflections
i
seemed
to
be
thus
drifting
into
philosophic
musing
when
helsmok
shook
me
gently
by
the
shoulder
a
glance
at
the
setting
moon
showed
that
i
had
been
asleep
and
that
it
was
long
past
midnight
here
therefore
ends
the
record
of
december
the
and
you
might
imagine
this
chapter
of
life
fitly
concluded
but
sometimes
an
of
plot
running
parallel
with
the
main
action
emerges
from
its
murky
depths
and
causes
a
transient
eddy
in
the
interminable
stream
of
events
something
of
this
kind
occurred
on
the
morning
of
the
collince
said
the
dutchman
softly

i
left
my

and
we
walked
out
across
the
plain
followed
by
the
faithful
pup
when
we
had
ranged
for
an
hour
in
day
began
to
break
and
nothing
had
except
four
of
stevenson
horses
but
we
heard
through
the
stillness
of
the
dawn
a
faint
trampling
of
hoofs
we
headed
for
the
sound
and
presently
found
ourselves
meeting
three
or
four
dozen
of
mixed
bullocks
and
horses
convoyed
by
five
mounted
chinamen
we
stood
aside
to
let
them
pass
by
this
time
an
advancing
daylight
enabled
me
to
recognise
the
roan
horse
of
sam
young
also
called
paul
with
a
rider
who
was
more
likely
to
be
that
proselyte
than
anyone
else
at
all
events
he
turned
upon
me
the
light
of
a
countenance
broad
yellow
and
effulgent
as
the
harvest
moon
of
pastoral
poetry
and
like
a

the

went
on

warbling

to
each

in
their
native
tongue
while
the
discomfited
foreign
devils
hurried
toward
their
camp
to
give
the
alarm
but
baxter
donovan
thompson
and
saunders
had
already
gone
out
to
feast
their
eyes
on
the
change
which
such
a
night
would
make
in
the
appearance
of
their
stock
stevenson
was
just
getting
on
his
feet
and
feeling
for
his
pipe
cartwright
was
still
asleep
it
seemed
a
pity
to
disturb
him
sharply
whetted
to
this
form
of
by
hardship
that
would
have
finished
any
civilised
man
he
had
gently
dozed
off
as
the
last
bite
of
a
copious
and
indigestible
supper
reached
his
and
had
never
moved
since
now
them
chinks
was
so
suddent
he
mused
as
i
woke
him
with
the
tidings
trapped
gosh
what
a
slant
i
had
at
that
fellow
horsepaddick
if
i
knowed
i
be
boun
no
good
over
it
now
anyhow
after
you
with

matches
stevenson
mine
all

barefooted
bob
in
this
remarked
stevenson
handing
the
matches
now
who
would
have
suspected
it
from
his
manner
last
night
but
no
one
is
to
be
trusted
better
take
our
saddles
and
bridles
with
us
in
respect
of
imbecility
and
ignorance
i
grant
you
i
replied
but
in
respect
of
deliberate
deceit
most
men
are
to
be
trusted
there
four
of
your
frames
left
out
near
those
coolibahs
stake
the
question
on
bob
he
suggested
may
as
well
catch
them
and
ride
so
be
it
to
both
proposals
the
sun
was
now
above
the
indefinable
horizon
looming
through
the
smoky
haze
all
objects
even
in
the
middle
distance
showed
vague
and
shadowy
but
knowing
which
way
the
marauders
had
taken
their
prey
we
went
after
them
making
a
slight
detour
to
secure
the
four
horses
but
we
were
just
in
time
to
discern
a
chinese
patrol
tailing
the
same
beasts
toward
a
larger
detachment
which
was
moving
in
the
direction
taken
by
the
earlier
draft
we
followed
and
for
my
own
part
even
if
i
had
not
been
personally
interested
i
should
have
judged
it
well
worth
going
a
mile
to
witness
the
strong
situation
which
supplied
a
sequel
to
our
homely
little
drama
precise
and
faithful
execution
with
masterly
strategy
had
realised
one
of
the
most
magnificent
hauls
of
assorted
trespassers
that
i
have
been
privileged
to
survey
i
jotted
down
a
memo
of
the
numbers
there
were
head
of
overworked
and
underfed
beasts
bullocks
and
horses
these
were
in
the
custody
of
nine
mongolians
two
and
two
gentlemen
the
latter
being
smythe
and
bert
also
bullocks
and
horses
left
their
bones
in
the
paddock
as
evidence
of
the
bitter
necessity
which
had
prompted
this
illegal
invasion
of
pastoral
leasehold
there
were
including
myself
claimants
present
in
person
or
arriving
by
twos
or
threes
a
few
of
these
were
ludicrously
abashed
others
were
insolent
but
the
large
majority
observed
a
fine
nonchalance
shading
down
to
apathy
and
smythe
true
to
his
order
of
mind
treated
the
first
with
outrageous
contumely
the
second
with
silent
contempt
and
the
third
with
a
respect
born
of
vague
disquietude
and
anxiety
for
the
morrow
a
squatter
just
or
unjust
generous
or
avaricious
hearty
or
exclusive
debonair
or
harsh
should
be
a
strong
man
this
was
a
weakling
and
my
soul
went
forth
in
genuine
compassion
for
him
the
three
hours
occupied
in
and
furnished
perhaps
as
varied
and
interesting
experiences
to
me
as
to
anyone
else
in
the
cast
first
a
thrill
of
dismay
altogether
apart
from
the
drama
and
afterward
the
fortuitous
cognisance
of
a
bit
of
in
the
main
action
my
horses
of
course
were
among
the
captives
each
of
them
with
both
buckled
round
the
same
leg
early
in
the
reception
whilst
treating
for
them
i
was
fairly
disconcerting
smythe
with
my
affability
when
that
sudden
consternation
came
over
me
where
was
pup
i
put
the
two
pairs
of
hobbles
round
bunyip
neck
and
saddled
cleopatra
without
delay
the
gallant
beast
as
if
he
knew
the
need
for
despatch
bucked
straight
ahead
till
he
merged
into
an
easy
gallop
a
few
minutes
brought
me
to
the
camp
and
my
anxiety
was
dispelled
the
chaps
had
hung
their
on
some
adjacent
lignum
out
of
reach
of
the
wild
pigs
but
at
a
height
accessible
to
pup
the
absence
of
the
owners
though
desirable
would
not
have
been
absolutely
necessary
to
the
performance

to

from

the

corner
of

these
unshamed
delinquents
rode
slowly
through
and
through
the
mob
each
vainly
trying
to
identify
and
count
his
own
while
now
and
then
one
would
pass
out
to
overbear
some
encroaching
pagan
by
interrogations
respecting
a
bay
mare
with
a
switch
tail
or
a
strawberry
bullock
with
wide
horns

ostentatious
inquiry
being
accompanied
by

and
vicious
jabbing
of

evidence

with

was
withdrawn
and

while
the
red

rose
higher
and
smythe
became
impatient
and
crusty
by
reason
of
the
transparent
dallying
helsmok
after
protracted
and
patient
sorting
brought
out
nineteen
of
his
horses
and
paid
for

his

said
he
would
have
to
borrow
a

of

a

of

represented
about
six
months
untiring
work
on
a
piece
of

all
along
been
pained
by
the
incongruity
of
such
a
gem
in
such
keeping
and
now
having
discharged
his
the
hollander
politely
borrowed
this
jewel
from
its
clinging
owner
and
so
recovered
his
horse
without

when

followed

across

he
beckoned
to
his

you
must
meet
me
with
the
buggy
bert
when
this
is
over
i
have
a
splitting
headache
we
can
do
without
you
now
alas
what
doth
a

with
splitting
headaches
answer
ye
pastoralists
stevenson
had
just
drafted
and
paid
for
his
batch
when
barefooted
bob
stalked
up
bearing
an
unmistakable
scowl
on
his
frank
face
and
a
saddle
on
his
shoulder
did
you
receive
my
message
last
night
bob
demanded
smythe
well
drawled
bob
i
could
say
whether
it
was
las
night
or
this
mornin
but
i
got
your
message
right
enough
and
why
did
you
why
did
i
repeated
bob
thoughtfully
you
be
so
good
as
to
inform
me
if
my
work
cleanin
out
reservoys
or
mindin
paddicks
but
you
should
be
loyal
to
your
employ
replied
smythe
severely
meanin
i
should
turn
dog
conjectured
bob
no
more
i
do
i
ai
turnin
dog
on
anybody
when
i
stick
to
my
own
work
an
keep
off
of
goin
partners
with
opium
an
leprosy
same
time
mind
you
i
be
dog
on
the
station
if
i
took
advantage
o
your
message
to
go
round
the
chaps
that
was
workin
on
the
paddick
way
i
was
situated
the
clean
thing
was
to
stand
out
an
that
what
i
done
meanwhile
stevenson
had
lingered
to
feel
his
pockets
sort
his
papers
examine
his
horse
legs
and
so
forth
while
his
draft
spread
out
over
the
grass
you
were
right
and
i
was
wrong
he
remarked
aside
to
me
bob
is
trustworthy
ruthlessly
so
only
in
respect
of
conscience
which
is
mere
moral
punctilio
and
may
with
any
degree
of
ignorance
or
error
i
replied
i
would
chance
sixpence
on
his
moral
sense
nor
on
yours
either
both
for
the
lesson
and
the
compliment
do
forget
to
call
round
at
my
camp
any
time
you
crossing
koolybooka
goodbye
are
your
bullocks
here
bob
demanded
smythe
horses
too
replied
bob
ai
you
lookin
at
but
smythe
did
know
beasts
on
the
station
and
bob
as
he
afterward
told
me
was
aware
of
his
boss
weakness
in
individuality
take
them
and
get
to
work
then
retorted
smythe
how
many
bullocks
are
you
working
he
added
with
sudden
suspicion
his
idea
evidently
being
that
bob
might
wish
to
do
a
good
turn
to
some
of
the
bullock
drivers
well
i
workin
ten
but
i
have
no
about
it
snapped
smythe
take
your
ten
and
go
right
drawled
bob
and
he
slowly
strode
toward
one
of
his
own
horses
and
you
fellows
vociferated
smythe
this
paddock
must
be
cleared
within
fifteen
minutes
or
i
shall
proceed
to
more
extreme
measures
whereupon
thompson
withdrew
his
lot
deliberately
followed
by
four
other
culprits
whose
names
are
immaterial
meanwhile
bob
had
some
trouble
in
sorting
out
his
ten
often
slowly
crossing
and
the
paths
of
donovan
and
baxter
in
their
still
more
arduous
and
task
at
last
the
of
the
squatter
counted
bob
ten
accompanied
by
his
spare
horse
as
he
tailed
the
lot
toward
his
camp
and
the
same
aquiline
optic
an
aggregate
of
to
baxter
and
donovan
who
to
my
own
private
knowledge
had
entered
the
paddock
with
this
disposed
of
the
whole
muster
months
afterward
when
the
two
mondunbarra
bullocks
had
been
into
a
team
from
the
sydney
side
i
camped
one
night
with
baxter
and
donovan
who
discussed
in
the
most
way
their
own
tranquil
appropriation
of
the
beasts
each
of
these
useful
scoundrels
had
the
answer
of
a
good
conscience
touching
the
transaction
they
maintained
with
manifest
sincerity
that
smythe
repudiation
of
the
bullocks
and
his
subsequent
levy
of
damages
upon
them
as
strangers
and
trespassers
gave
themselves
a
certain
right
of
trover
which
prerogative
they
had
duly
developed
into
a
title
containing
nine
points
of
the
law
not
equal
to
a
of
course
but
good
enough
for
the
track
and
throughout
the
discussion
bob
name
was
never
mentioned
nor
his
complicity
hinted
at
such
is
life
chapter
vi
sat
runnymede
to
alf
jones
not
much
in
that
bill
of
fare
you
think
perhaps
not
nor
was
count
federigo
degli
alberighi
falcon
much
of
a
banquet
for
the
lady
giovanna
though
that
meagre
catering
cost
a
considerable
jar
to
the
sensibilities
of
the
impoverished
aristocrat
accurately
represented
in
this
instance
by
the
writer
of
these
memoirs
of
course
i
am
committed
to
any
narration
imposed
by
my
random
election
of
dates
but
just
notice
that
perversity
that
untowardness
that
cussedness
in
the
affairs
of
men
which
brings
me
back
to
runnymede
above
all
places
in
the
spacious
quarter
of
the
mother
province
the
unforeseen
sequences
of
that
original
option
are
masters
of
the
situation
till
they
run
their
course
and
most
tyrannical
masters
they
are
they
have
tied
me
to
a
stake
i
can
not
fly
but
i
must
fight
the
course
ay
your
novelist
delights
in
relating
his
simply
because
he
can
invent
something
to
pamper
his
own
romantic
notions
whereas
a
similar
undertaking
makes
the
faithful
chronicler
squirm
inasmuch
as
oh
you
find
out
soon
enough
five
days
before
the
date
of
this
entry
i
had
received
orders
to
proceed
at
once
to
runnymede
and
there
to
complete
an
which
would
in
the
meantime
be
forwarded
from
our
central
office
to
montgomery
twelve
hours
riding
had
brought
me
to
the
station
but
the
document
had
not
arrived
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
wait
till
the
next
mail
came
in
that
would
be
on
the
being
a
little
too
exalted
for
the
men
hut
and
a
great
deal
too
vile
for
the
boss
house
i
was
quartered
in
the
narangies
barracks
social
status
apart
from
all
consideration
of
mind
manners
or
even
money
is
more
accurately
weighed
on
a
australian
station
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
the
of
riverina
is
rich
in
variations
of
a
mythus
pointing
to
the
combat
between
a
quiet
and
a
domineering
squatter
in
the
brave
days
of
old
with
one
solitary
exception
each
station
from
the
murray
to
the
darling
claims
and
holds
this
legend
as
its
own
on
kooltopa
alone
the
tables
are
turned
and
the
amiable
stewart
makes
a
holy
show
of
the
truculent
but
on
no
station
not
even
on
kooltopa
has
imagination
bodied
forth
or
tradition
handed
down
any
such
vagary
as
might
imply
that
a
saw
the
inside
of
the
house
or
the
barracks
and
a
narangy
will
always
avoid
your
eye
as
he
relates
how
on
some
momentous
occasion
the
boss
invited
him
to
step
in
and
take
a
seat
in
the
society
of
a
proper
station
you
have
a
reproduction
of
the
temple
economy
under
the
old
jewish
ritual
the
manager
house
is
a
sanctum
sanctorum
wherein
no
one
but
the
high
priest
enters
the
barracks
is
an
inner
court
accessible
to
the
priests
only
the
men
hut
is
an
outer
court
for
the
accommodation
of
lay
worshippers
and
the
nearest
or
perhaps
one
of
the
empty
huts
at
the
is
the
court
of
the
gentiles
and
the
restrictions
of
the
temple
were
never
more
rigid
than
those
of
a
station
this
usage
of
course
bears
fruit
after
its
kind
it
was
more
than
a
mere
custom
with
the
mediaeval
baron
it
was
a
large
part
of
the
religion
which
guided
his
rascally
life
to
wolf
his
pork
in
fellowship
with
his
hence
he
could
bash
the
latter
about
at
pleasure
and
they
in
return
were
prepared
to
die
in
his
service
a
good
solid
social
system
in
its
own
brutal
and
way
the
squatter
of
course
can
not
get
back
to
the
long
table
with
the
dogs
underneath
but
he
ought
to
some
practicable
equivalent
to
the
baron
crude
and
camaraderie
this
having
been
a
necessary
condition
of
vassal
loyalty
in
olden
time
without
vassal
loyalty
or
abject
vassal
fear
the
monopolist
sleep
can
never
be
secure
domination
to
be
unassailable
must
have
overwhelming
force
in
reserve
moral
force
as
in
the
feudal
system
or
physical
force
as
in
our
police
system
the
of
accredited
integrity
and
capability
though
so
to
speak
ducally
weedy
has
moral
force
in
reserve
and
we
all
know
how
he
controls
the
also
the
man
glaringly
destitute
of
integrity
or
capacity
but
noticed
as
having
a
a
square
jaw
countersunk
eyes
and
the
rest
in
proportion
is
suspected
of
having
the
other
kind
of
force
in
reserve
and
we
know
how
he
escapes
anything
like
wanton
personal
indignity
in
his
intercourse
with
gentle
or
simple
now
the
only
adherent
to
station
aristocracy
resides
in
the
manager
power
to
sack
the
squatter
of
ago
dominated
his
immigrant
servants
by
moral
force
no
difficult
matter
with
a
on
one
side
and
a
squad
of
hereditary
grovellers
on
the
other
he
dominated
his
convict
servants
by
physical
force
an
equally
easy
task
but
now
the
old
squatter
has
gone
to
the
mansions
above
the
immigrant
and
old
hand
to
the
kitchen
below
and
between
the
of
the
squatter
and
that
of
his
contemporary
there
is
very
little
to
choose
hence
the
toe
of
the
blucher
treads
on
the
heel
of
the
tan
boot
and
galls
its
stitches
the
average
share
of
that
knowledge
which
is
power
is
undoubtedly
in
favour
of
the
tan
boot
but
the
preponderant
moiety
is
just
as
surely
held
by
the
blucher
in
our
democracy
the
sum
of
cultivated
intelligence
and
corresponding
sensitiveness
to
affront
is
dangerously
high
and
becoming
higher
on
the
other
hand
the
squatter
even
if
pliant
by
disposition
can
not
spring
to
the
strain
social
usage
being
territorial
rather
than
personal
so
here
you
see
we
have
the
two
factors
which
should
blend
together
in
harmony
namely
the
stubborn
tradition
of
the
soil
and
the
elastic
genius
of
the
divorced
by
an
breach
there
are
two
remedies
and
only
two
available
failing
one
of
these
something
must
soon
or
later
give
way
with
a
crash
either
the
anachronistic
tradition
must
make
suicidal
concessions
or
the
people
must
drown
all
plebeian
australian
males
in
infancy
and
fill
the
vacancy
with
asiatics
my
acquaintance
with
runnymede
dated
from
about
seven
years
before
tracking
three
stray
steers
i
had
reached
the
station
at
sunset
i
had
come
more
than
sixty
miles
nearly
all
unstocked
country
in
two
days
and
with
only
one
chance
meal
my
horse
was
provokingly
fagged
i
was
ragged
by
reason
of
the
scrub
and
dirty
for
lack
of
water
whilst
an
and
ungrammatical
order
on
naylor
of
koolybooka
for
was
the
nearest
approach
to
money
in
my
possession
i
had
left
my
and
was
approaching
the
when
i
met
montgomery
himself
i
told
him
my
story
well
go
to
the
store
and
get
your
rations
said
he
disgustedly
see
if
those
steers
of
yours
are
on
the
run
get
them
off
as
quick
as
possible
no
doubt
come
or
the
store
will
be
closed
the
storekeeper
measured
me
out
a
pannikin
of
dust
into
a
newspaper
and
directed
me
to
the
corner
of
the
as
the
best
place
for
my
horse
there
in
the
spacious
court
of
the
gentiles
i
made
a
fire
worked
up
my
on
the
flat
top
of
the
corner
post
ate
it
hot
off
the
coals
then
lay
down
in
contentment
and
read
the
newspaper
till
i
could
smell
my
hair
scorching
and
so
to
sleep
my
next
visit
to
runnymede
took
place
about
three
years
later
i
had
timed
myself
to
to
the
station
on
a
saturday
afternoon
with
of
wire
montgomery
met
me
as
before
collins
are
you
i
got
the
duplicate
we
wo
disturb
your
load
till
monday
shove
your
trespassers
in
the
and
go
and
stop
in
the
hut
i
was
rising
in
the
world
next
time
i
called
at
runnymede
it
was
to
inspect
and
verify
the
register
which
montgomery
was
supposed
to
keep
for
my
department
being
now
worthy
of
the
inner
court
i
was
to
sleep
in
the
spare
bed
in
room
and
to
sit
at
meat
with
the
narangies
where
we
were
waited
on
by
a
menial
if
my
social
evolution
had
continued
if
i
had
expanded
for
instance
into
a
literary
tourist
of
sound
conservative
principles
i
would
have
seen
the
inside
of
the
boss
house
before
i
had
done
but
as
it
happened
i
withered
and
contracted
from
that
point
simultaneously
mind
you
with
a
perceptible
diminution
of
my
inherent
ignorance
and
correlative
uselessness
such
however
is
life
but
on
the
present
occasion
i
had
been
quartered
in
the
barracks
for
four
whole
days
as
idle
as
a
ship
upon
an
ocean
made
iridescent
by
the
unavoidable
dripping
and
sprinkling
of
the
pigment
used
a
clumsy
metaphor
but
happily
not
my
own
this
lethargy
was
inexcusable
i
had
three
filled
with
valuable
memoranda
for
a
series
of
shakespearean
studies
and
o
how
i
longed
for
a
few
untroubled
leisure
just
to
break
ground
on
the
work
those
notes
had
been
written
in
noisy
huts
or
by
flickering
firelight
or
on
horseback
written
in
eager
activity
of
mind
and
in
hope
of
such
an
opportunity
for
amplification
as
i
was
now
letting
slip
but
i
have
one
besetting
sin
and
this
delilah
scissors
in
hand
had
dogged
me
to
runnymede
and
polled
me
by
the
skull
nor
could
i
plead
inadvertence
when
i
gravitated
into
the
old
familiar
vice
but
i
left
the
consequences
for
an
the
opportunity
was
there
like
an
uncorked
bottle
under
a
dipsomaniac
nose
and
that
was
enough
more
i
kept
saying
to
myself
more
and
the
last
so
sweet
was
so
fatal
according
to
the
unhappy
custom
of
besetting
sins
this
evil
thing
came
upon
me
the
moment
i
woke
on
the
morning
of
the
i
slipped
into
my
clothes
and
started
off
along
the
fence
toward
a
natural
hollow
a
mile
from
the
station
here
twelve
or
fifteen
years
continuous
trampling
by
the

the
billygoat
on
ground
theretofore
untrodden
except
by
blackfellows
birds
and
marsupials
had
developed
a
pond
sometimes
a
couple
of
acres
in
area
and
eight
feet
deep
in
the
middle
and
sometimes
dry
full
or
dry

or

the
pond
was
known
as

at
the
time
i
speak
of
the
water
was
about
in
both
senses
and
evaporating
at
the
rate
of
an
inch
a
day
with
a
good
supple
stem
of
saltbush
i
dispersed
three
snakes
that
lay
around
the
margin
waiting
for
frogs
then
i
noticed
my
empty
clothes
lying
on
the
bank
and
found
myself
sliding
through
the
lukewarm
water
recklessly
and
wickedly
discounting
the
prospective
virility
of
another
day
and
there
i
remained
till
i
thought
it
was
time
to
go
to
breakfast
nothing
but
that
integrity
which
springs
from
the
certainty
of
being
ultimately
prompts
me
to
the
foregoing
confession
a
confession
which
i
can
not
but
regard
as
damaging
from
the
literary
as
well
as
from
the
moral
point
of
view
and
for
this
reason
during
the
last
twenty
or
thirty
years
the
foremost
humorist
of
our
language
has
from
time
to
time
casually
touched
on
the
removal
of
natural
and
acquired
dirt
by
means
of
bathing
but
however
lightly
and
racily
this
subject
might
leave
his
pen
it
has
been
degraded
into
repulsiveness
by
the
clumsy
handling
of
imitators
some
things
look
best
when
merely
implied
in
the
dim
background
and
recent
literature
certainly
proves
this
to
be
one
of
them
there
is
nothing
dainty
or
picturesque
in
the
presentment
of
a
naked
character
washing
himself
yet
how
few
of
our
later
novels
or
notes
of
travel
are
without
that
bit
of
description
generally
by
an
ungainly
reflection
on
the
dirt
of
some
other
person
class
or
community
the
noxious
affectation
is
everywhere
even
the
salvation
officer
can
not
now
write
his
contribution
to
the
war
cry
without
a
detailed
account
of
the
bath
he
took
on
this
or
that
occasion
a
thing
which
has
no
interest
whatever
for
anyone
but
himself
it
would
be
much
more
becoming
to
wash
our
dirty
skins
as
well
as
our
dirty
calico
in
private
we
might
advantageously
copy
here
woman
in
the
nature
of
things
must
accumulate
dirt
as
we
do
and
she
must
now
and
then
wash
that
dirt
off
or
it
would
be
there
still
like
paul
i
speak
as
a
man
but
the
scribess
never
parades
her
ablutions
on
the
printed
page
if
for
instance
you
could
prevail
upon
the
whole
galaxy
of
australian
authoresses
and
to
attend
a
northern
victoria
agricultural
show
in
their
literary
capacity
you
would
see
proof
of
this
each
would
write
her
catalogue
of
aristocratic
visitors
her
unfavourable
impressions
re
quality
of
refreshments
her
sarcastic
notice
of
other
women
attire
and
her
fragmentary
observations
on
the
floral
exhibits
but
not
one
would
her
memoir
with
an
account
of
the
she
gave
herself
in
the
seclusion
of
her
lodgings
when
the
turmoil
was
over
woman
must
be
more
than
figuratively
a
poem
if
she
can
promenade
a
dusty
for
a
long
hot
afternoon
without
increasing
in
weight
by
exogenous
accretion
but
her
soulfulness
however
powerless
to
disallow
dirt
silently
asserts
itself
when
that
dirt
comes
to
be
shifted
however
mere
fidelity
to
fact
brings
me
into
the
swim
in
the
figurative
sense
as
well
as
in
the
literal
and
the
sad
consciousness
of
fellowship
with
men
who
themselves
on
paper
is
added
to
the
humiliation
of
the
disclosure
itself
in
a
word
just
as
i
lost
my
vigour
in
the
i
lose
my
individuality
in
the
confession
but
i
lose
my
discrimination
nor
my
veracity
i
do
call
my
evil
good
in
physical
science
or
in
pure
ethics
whoop
i
am
antony
yet
nature
by
a
kind
of
monroe
doctrine
has
allotted
the
dry
land
to
man
and
various
other
animals
the
water
to
fish
leeches
etc
the
air
to
birds
bats
flies
etc
the
fire
to
salamanders
imps
unbaptised
babies
etc
and
she
strictly
penalises
the
trespass
of
each
class
on
the
domain
of
any
other
naturally
then
about
sixteen
raids
within
four
days
on
an
alien
element
had
stewed
every
atom
of
vigour
out
of
my
system
and
quenched
every
spark
of
heroism
consider
the
child
he
is
the
creature
of
instinct
and
instinct
according
to
my
late
relative
wilkie
collins
never
errs
though
reason
often
does
so
as
we
know
to
our
cost
now
the
picaninny
knows
what
is
good
for
him
place
him
in
promixity
to
a
or
an
and
observe
what
takes
place
he
approaches
it
with
that
droll
yet
pathetic
method
of
locomotion
peculiar
to
his
period
of
life
travelling
on
both
hands
and
one
knee
whilst
with
the
big
toe
of
the
other
he
propels
himself
along
in
the
very
centre
of
the
dirt
he
deftly
whirls
into
a
sitting
position
and
proceeds
to
redeem
the
time
maintaining
meanwhile
that
silence
which
is
the
perfectest
herald
of
joy
ormuzd
the
good
has
inspired
him
with
this
inclination
but
the
minister
of
ahriman
the
evil
is
not
far
off
the
mother
seizes
the
mite
of
a
bambino
by
the
wrist
and
carries
him
at
to
the
kitchen
it
is
to
no
purpose
that
he
becomes
alternately
rigid
and
flaccid
lifting
up
his
voice
in
clamorous
protest
and
making
himself
as
heavy
as
a
bag
of
shot
that
misguided
woman
denudes
him
washes
him
rubs
soap
into
his
eyes
spanks
him
him
and
sets
him
in
a
clean
place
giving
him
a
teaspoon
to
play
with
then
she
resumes
her
household
work
whereupon
ormuzd
whispers
in
the
pledge
projecting
ear
and
that
bimbo
straightway
turns
his
head
toward
the
and
again
illustrating
the
first
clause
of
the
sphynx
not
very
complicated
riddle
keeps
the
strictly
noiseless
tenor
of
his
way
till
ahriman
priestess
looks
round
to
see
the
metaphors
fulfilled
of
the
pup
turning
again
to
his
ashheap
and
the
papoose
that
was
washed
wallowing
in
the
and
so
the
strife
goes
on
to
the
last
syllable
of
recorded
time
not
between
mother
and
child
as
you
are
prone
to
imagine
but
between
the
two
great
principles
of
good
and
evil
so
widely
allegorised
and
personified
yet
so
uncertainly
grasped
and
so
loosely
defined
the
result
is
sad
enough
physically
not
one
in
ten
of
us
is
what
the
doctor
ordered
and
of
course
brought
mentally
we
are
mostly
fools
morally
we
are
in
a
sense
little
better
than
we
ought
to
be
and
such
is
life
at
breakfast
i
remember
there
occurred
a
slight
misunderstanding
between
beaudesart
the
housekeeper
and
ida
the
white
trash
whose
vocation
was
to
wait
on
the
narangies
beaudesart
was
do
study
that
expression
too
closely
or
you
get
puzzled
her
father
hungry
buckley
of
baroona
a
gentleman
addicted
to
high
living
and
extremely
plain
thinking
had
been
by
apoplexy
and
abundantly
filled
a
premature
grave
some
time
in
the
early
after
seeing
baroona
pass
by
foreclosure
into
the
hands
of
a
brainy
and
nosey
financier
people
who
had
known
the
poor
gentleman
when
he
was
very
emphatically
in
the
flesh
and
had
listened
to
his
palaver
and
noticed
his
feckless
way
of
going
about
things
were
not
surprised
at
the
misfortune
that
had
struck
buckley
had
then
taken
a
small
villa
near
sydney
where
in
course
of
time
her
son
and
daughter
took
positions
of
vantage
such
as
their
circumstances
allowed
each
being
prepared
to
stake
his
or
her
gentility
an
objectionable
word
but
it
has
no
synonym
and
nasty
things
have
nasty
names
against
any
amount
of
filth
that
could
be
planked
down
by
an
aspiring
representative
of
the
opposite
sex
but
young
buckley
who
was
something
indefinite
in
a
bank
presently
ventured
on
a
bit
of
blacksmith
work
and
being
by
reason
of
hopeless
impecuniosity
not
worth
lenient
treatment
got
a
tenner
hard
about
the
same
time
miss
buckley
then
a
singularly
handsome
young
lady
became
a
veritable
heroine
of
romance
a
german
prince
whose
name
i
forget
at
the
present
moment
visited
these
provinces
and
our
beatrix
esmond
well
perhaps
a
reflected
greatness
is
better
than
no
greatness
at
all
so
at
all
events
thought
lionel
who
married
miss
buckley
on
the
strength
of
her
celebrity
this
young
man
in
less
than
two
years
went
to
his
reward
and
his
widow
after
a
seemly
interval
reinforced
her
financial
position
by
accepting
the
hand
and
heart
of
old
mr
tidy
an
aitchless
whose
hobby
was
to
collect
his
own
rents
bottoming
on
gold
this
time
she
buried
the
old
man
within
eighteen
months
and
paid
probate
duty
on
after
three
years
of
something
like
life
she
accepted
the
addresses
of
the
hon
henry
beaudesart
a
social
refugee
from
belgravia
wherever
that
may
be
this
was
a
gentleman
of
such
refined
tastes
that
it
took
over
a
year
to
satisfy
his
so
when
she
buried
him
after
two
years
trial
it
was
in
the
sure
and
certain
hope
that
he
would
stay
where
he
was
put
this
brought
her
to
about
the
year
and
the
tide
had
turned
for
the
next
two
years
the
poor
gentlewoman
hung
round
the
scene
of
her
former
glories
wearing
garments
that
were
out
of
fashion
and
otherwise
drinking
to
its
very
dregs
the
cup
of
bitterness
which
a
heartless
society
holds
to
the
lips
of
its
deposed
queen
the
elegancies
of
life
were
necessities
to
her
but
those
elegancies
would
cost
to
put
it
tangibly
the
balance
of
profit
accruing
from
the
continuous
labour
of
at
least
fifty
average
industrious
women
and
when
the
industrious
women
were
not
to
the
fore
where
were
the
elegancies
to
come
from
where
indeed
it
is
a
question
which
has
broken
many
a
gentler
heart
than
maud
beaudesart
and
will
break
many
more
it
is
a
cruel
question
but
not
to
put
it
would
be
more
cruel
still
for
while
this
or
that
gentlewoman
is
in
danger
no
gentlewoman
is
safe
and
the
basest
type
of
mind
is
that
which
gloats
on
the
adversity
of
the
world
spoiled
child
the
next
basest
is
that
which
concentrates
its
sympathy
on
the
same
adversity
the
least
base
i
think
is
that
which
goaded
by
a
human
compassion
for
all
human
distress
longs
to
get
a
lever
under
the
order
of
things
which
necessitates
the
spoiling
of
any
particular
child
two
or
three
years
before
the
date
of
this
record
montgomery
a
distant
relation
and
friend
of
beaudesart
had
met
the
latter
in
sydney
and
had
brought
her
out
to
runnymede
montgomery
viewing
the
tenacious
widow
as
a
fixture
had
insisted
upon
her
having
some
definite
status
on
the
place
and
she
was
therefore
installed
as
housekeeper
little
wonder
that
the
poor
gentlewoman
remembering
her
own
departed
greatness
and
chafing
under
the
mild
yoke
of
montgomery
used
to
make
the
handmaidens
of
the
household
wish
themselves
in
gehenna
dionysius
the
younger
shifted
from
his
throne
opened
a
school
so
that
he
might
take
it
out
of
the
boys
such
is
life
levites
tribesmen
and
gentiles
alike
used
to
poke
fun
at
me
over
beaudesart
but
the
fact
that
they
thought
they
knew
my
real
standing
whereas
they
did
seemed
to
weigh
so
much
in
my
favour
as
to
make
their
banter
anything
but
provoking
yet
my
relations
with
the
gentlewoman
were
painful
enough
i
tell
you
exactly
how
we
stood
on
my
first
official
visit
to
runnymede
whilst
montgomery
and
i
stood
talking
in
front
of
the
store
beaudesart
passed
by
he
detained
her
a
moment
to
speak
of
my
but
first
with
grave
courtliness
introduced
me
to
her
as
the
last
lineal
descendant
of
commander
david
collins
situated
as
i
was
what
could
i
say
what
would
you
have
said
i
had
to
fall
in
with
the
thing
at
the
time
and
having
done
so
of
course
i
had
to
live
up
to
it
moreover
this
meant
a
good
deal
when
i
had
to
beat
time
with
a
woman
like
maud
in
spite
of
my
chivalrous
disinclination
to
flaunt
superior
descent
in
the
face
of
a
lady
our
shuddersome
intimacy
deepened
and
the
necessity
for
keeping
up
my
accompaniment
seemed
to
grow
more
imperative
as
it
became
more
difficult
but
even
at
this
distance
of
time
it
soothes
me
to
remember
that
i
went
through
the
ordeal
without
any
sacrifice
of
veracity
partly
by
modest
reticence
touching
my
forbears
and
the
rest
by
a
little
diplomacy
for
instance
in
remarking
that
my
grandfather
sir
timothy
collins
had
been
well
known
in
connection
with
the
turf
i
omitted
to
explain
that
he
was
allowed
to
obtain
it
only
from
a
specified
bog
and
that
his
custom
was
to
sell
it
at
the
stump
for
so
much
per
to
be
taken
out
in
spuds
or
oatmeal
altogether
i
got
on
better
than
you
might
expect
meanwhile
some
unhappy
hitch
in
the
order
of
things
as
well
as
that
strange
fascination
which
accompanies
danger
of
detection
kept
dragging
me
to
runnymede
on
every
pretext
another
thing
beaudesart
possessed
a
vast
store
of
debrett
information
touching
those
early
whose
enterprise
is
hymned
by
loftier
harps
than
mine
but
whose
sordid
greed
and
unspeakable
arrogance
has
yet
to
be
said
or
sung
socially
she
knew
something
about
most
of
our
old
nobility
and
her
supported
by
the
which
invests
aristocratic
giddiness
lent
tenderness
of
colour
and
accuracy
of
detail
to
some
queer
revelations
she
could
make
me
fancy
myself
in
ancient
corinth
and
such
was
her
hypnotic
power
or
my
adaptability
that
in
the
atmosphere
of
runnymede
i
became
a
conservative
of
the
good
old
type
and
actually
enjoyed
the
communion
of
soul
necessarily
subsisting
between
a
pedigreed
lady
and
a
pedigreed
gentleman
we
habitually
spoke
of
the
montgomerys
as
of
the
wealthy
lower
orders
people
of
yesterday
and
so
forth
and
because
we
took
especial
care
to
let
nobody
hear
us
the
jealousy
of
our
inferiors
manifested
itself
in
that
badinage
so
dear
to
the
mind
i
say
advisedly
for
there
was
an
indescribable
something
about
us
two
when
we
got
together
a
something
too
subtle
for
expression
in
the
vulgar
tongue
which
made
us
feel
the
station
aristocracy
to
be
a
mere
bourgeoisie
and
ourselves
the
real
mackay
of
course
montgomery
had
forgotten
my
high
descent
as
soon
as
the
words
of
introduction
were
out
of
his
mouth
and
i
had
begged
the
lady
to
conceal
my
gentilesse
for
the
present
family
pride
causing
me
to
be
extremely
sensitive
on
the
subject
of
my
low
position
this
was
the
only
witchcraft
i
had
used
ida
the
handmaid
of
the
barracks
was
a
common
person
she
certainly
belonged
to
the
same
mammiferous
division
of
vertebrata
as
beaudesart
but
there
the
affinity
ended
with
a
jerk
in
a
word
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
late
victorian
selector
her
father
after
twelve
years
manful
struggle
with
a
bad
selection
had
hanged
himself
in
the
stable
whereupon
the
storekeeper
had
sold
the
movables
and
the
mortgagee
the
farm
runnymede
was
ida
first
situation
her
wages
month
by
month
went
to
the
support
of
her
mother
then
living
frugally
in
a
country
township
taking
care
of
ida
remaining
brother
who
had
been
knocked
out
of
shape
through
getting
in
a
painfully
protracted
way
by
a
heavy
set
of
harrows
her
other
brother
had
unfortunately
sat
down
to
eat
his
lunch
on
the
wrong
side
of
a
partly
grubbed
tree
altogether
poor
ida
had
very
little
to
be
thankful
for
personally
she
was
without
any
exception
the
ugliest
white
girl
i
ever
saw
she
measured
about
twice
as
long
from
the
chin
to
as
from
benevolence
to
amativeness
not
one
feature
of
her
face
was
even
middling
her
skin
was
of
a
neutral
creamy
tint
and
she
had
a
straggly
goatee
of
dirty
white
with
woolly
of
the
same
colour
in
lieu
of
the
short
silky
moustache
which
is
the
piquant
of
our
besides
this
she
was
lame
on
account
of
the
of
one
of
her
ankles
having
been
cut
through
by
a
and
in
addition
to
all
this
the
fingers
of
her
left
hand
had
been
snipped
to
a
uniform
length
through
getting
into
the
feed
of
a
montgomery
had
picked
her
purposely
for
the
barracks
so
at
least
he
told
montgomery
so
she
told
beaudesart
and
so
the
latter
told
me
for
myself
i
often
felt
an
impulse
to
marry
the
poor
mortal
partly
from
compassion
partly
from
the
idea
that
such
an
action
would
redound
largely
to
my
honour
and
partly
from
the
impression
that
such
an
unattractive
woman
would
idolise
a
fellow
like
me
the
daughter
of
an
unlucky
selector
is
not
taught
to
spare
herself
and
ida
was
an
untiring
and
conscientious
worker
for
the
rest
she
was
a
generous
patient
girl
transparently
honest
in
word
and
deed
the
gentle
soul
shining
through
its
homely
mask
like
a
candle
in
a
bottle
upon
the
whole
ugly
illiterate
and
above
all
lowly
and
defenceless
as
she
was
she
would
have
made
an
admirable
butt
for
the
of
your
illustrated
comic
journal
beaudesart
abhorred
ida
for
her
ugliness
for
her
vulgarity
for
her
simplicity
but
chiefly
for
her
name
i
can
sympathise
with
the
gentlewoman
here
remembering
how
rancorously
i
once
hated
another
boy
because
he
came
from
the
isle
of
wight
yet
the
two
mammals
chronic
state
of
friction
was
partly
chargeable
on
ida
who
would
answer
back
in
her
own
way
and
to
add
to
the
aggravation
she
could
answer
back
without
crying
something
had
gone
wrong
as
usual
this
morning
and
beaudesart
remained
in
the
narangies
mildly
glowering
into
ida
face
and
noting
with
polite
deprecation
the
convulsive
sobs
which
the
sensitive
girl
vainly
tried
to
repress
before
the
young
fellows
beauty
in
distress
is
a
favorite
theme
of
your
shallow
romancists
but
to
the
philosophic
mind
its
pathos
is
nothing
to
that
of
ugliness
in
distress
at
the
best
of
times
poor
ida
was
her
sunniest
smile
wrung
my
soul
with
commiseration
and
when
the
sympathy
naturally
accorded
to
helpless
anguish
was
superimposed
upon
that
which
she
claimed
as
her
birthright
the
pressure
became
intolerable
it
had
always
been
my
consolation
to
think
that
she
would
yet
be
a
bright
and
beautiful
angel
and
now
i
fell
back
for
solace
upon
that
thought
though
how
the
thing
was
to
be
accomplished
seemed
a
problem
too
vast
for
the
grasp
of
a
and
partially
dissolved
understanding
like
mine
remember
mary
i
reprimand
you
for
your
own
good
murmured
the
lady
of
course
brought
up
as
you
have
been
you
ca
be
expected
to
have
the
manners
we
look
for
in
the
servants
of
a
household
so
when
i
consider
it
my
duty
to
instruct
you
in
the
decencies
of
life
you
must
take
it
people
have
to
suffer
for
their
ignorance
mary
as
well
as
for
their
faults
i
know
how
you
must
feel
it
but
parents
in
the
position
that
yours
were
in
should
send
their
children
to
service
before
they
are
too
old
for
the
necessary
training
my
parents
done
the
best
they
could
to
keep
their
home
together
protested
the
girl
in
a
choking
voice
speak
grammatically
my
dear
no
doubt
your
parents
did
as
you
say
but
my
point
is
that
they
forgot
their
position
instead
of
accepting
the
fair
wages
and
abundant
food
which
society
offers
to
their
class
they
joined
the
hungry
horde
that
has
cut
up
those
fine
victorian
stations
part
of
the
retribution
justly
falls
on
their
children
part
of
course
on
themselves
your
father
i
venture
to
say
often
envied
the
life
of
the
domestic
animals
on
the
station
where
he
had
selected
but
he
aimed
at
independence
independence
a
fine
word
mary
but
a
poor
reality
this
idea
of
independence
is
much
too
common
amongst
people
who
however
poorly
they
may
fare
are
nevertheless
better
fed
than
taught
i
afraid
you
wilfully
overlook
the
religious
side
of
the
question
mary
the
divine
command
to
do
our
duty
in
that
state
of
life
in
which
it
has
pleased
god
to
call
us
service
is
honourable
here
ida
sobbed
out
something
that
sounded
like
a
rejoinder
and
there
was
a
harder
ring
in
the
lady
voice
as
she
continued
without
pausing
yes
my
dear
if
your
parents
had
known
themselves
and
had
cheerfully
remained
in
the
position
for
which
their
birth
and
education
fitted
them
you
would
have
been
spared
many
humiliations
and
it
would
have
been
better
for
your
father
both
in
time
and
in
eternity
o
ca
you
let
him
rest
in
his
grave
sobbed
the
girl
i
have
no
wish
to
condemn
him
mary
replied
the
lady
soothingly
i
assure
you
it
is
dreadful
to
me
to
realise
the
fate
of
that
poor
man
where
the
worm
dieth
not
and
the
fire
is
not
quenched
i
was
only
wishing
to
show
you
what
a
tempting
of
providence
it
is
for
people
of
the
lower
classes
to
have
notions
above
what
their
maker
intends
for
them
and
you
know
how
prone
you
are
to
forget
your
place
as
you
did
this
morning
susan
has
the
same
fault
i
sorry
to
say
but
i
condone
it
to
some
extent
in
her
she
has
the
advantage
of
good
looks
and
naturally
expects
to
better
her
condition
by
marriage
but
surely
mary
one
glance
at
yourself
in
the
glass
ought
to
show
you
the
impropriety
of
counting
upon
any
endowment
of
nature
indeed
i
know
i
no
beauty
blubbered
ida
and
her
tears
rained
hot
and
fast
on
the
back
of
my
neck
as
she
replaced
my
of
course
you
did
make
yourself
pursued
the
lady
blandly
but
in
view
of
your
lack
of
personal
attractions
you
should
endeavour
to
cultivate
the
modest
and
respectful
demeanour
which
befits
a
sphere
of
life
that
you
are
likely
to
occupy
permanently
no
doubt
it
was
good
policy
to
transport
yourself
to
a
locality
where
the
males
of
your
own
class
are
in
such
large
majority
but
the
movement
is
still
attended
by
certain
disadvantages
a
female
whose
looks
approach
repulsiveness
should
at
least
have
a
character
beyond
suspicion
and
for
any
woman
to
run
away
from
the
neighbourhood
where
her
doings
are
known
is
not
the
way
to
inspire
confidence
and
though
it
has
pleased
god
for
your
own
good
to
remove
the
snare
of
beauty
far
from
you
yet
well
we
must
believe
what
we
hear
on
good
authority
your
master
before
engaging
you
should
have
made
some
inquiry
regarding
your
antecedents
and
not
have
left
these
things
to
i
wish
i
could
hold
you
guiltless
mary
ask
your
own
conscience
whether
you
were
justified
in
obtaining
entry
to
an
establishment
like
this
it
places
me
in
a
very
difficult
here
ida
turned
and
with
blazing
tearless
eyes
fearlessly
fronted
her
the
latter
faltered
and
paused
she
had
gone
a
step
too
far
and
had
trod
on
the
lion
tail
what
that
you
say
you
wicked
woman
demanded
ida
in
a
calm
voice
yet
breathing
heavily
ai
i
miserable
enough
without
you
lyin
away
my
character
i
make
you
prove
your
words
as
sure
as
you
standin
there
you
forgetting
yourself
replied
the
housekeeper
haughtily
though
still
quailing
before
the
girl
terrible
plainness
of
speech
and
person
am
i
indeed
well
we
both
go
straight
to
montgomery
she
your
missus
as
well
as
mine
she
is
an
we
git
her
to
write
to
a
dozen
people
that
knows
me
since
i
was
as
high
as
that
i
make
it
hot
for
you
bodyzart
so
i
will
what
impertinence
ejaculated
the
lady
moistening
her
lips
leave
the
apartment
this
instant
mary
and
send
how
dare
you
call
me
out
o
my
name
for
two
pins
i
slap
your
face
replied
ida
her
voice
rising
to
a
hysterical
scream
you
know
what
my
proper
name
is
so
you
do
an
i
wo
leave
the
apartment
to
please
you
so
i
wo
think
god
made
me
for
the
likes
o
you
to
wipe
your
feet
on
think
i
bin
behavin
myself
decent
all
my
life
for
you
to
put
a
slur
on
me
if
i
wanted
to
bemean
myself
could
i
cast
up
somethin
you
would
like
to
be
minded
of
ai
you
ashamed
o
yourself
you
ole
gentlemen
i
must
apologise
for
my
servant
said
the
housekeeper
with
quiet
dignity
she
seems
to
have
taken
leave
of
her
senses
i
trust
you
will
overlook
her
rudeness
she
knows
no
better
they
ca
help
doin
me
justice
an
that
all
i
ask
from
anybody
rejoined
ida
looking
appealingly
round
the
table
an
look
here
bodyzart
i
bin
full
up
o
your
ever
since
i
come
to
this
house
an
i
put
up
with
it
for
the
sake
o
other
people
but
now
you
put
a
slur
on
my
character
an
it
me
an
you
for
it
i
ai
goin
to
let
this
drop
i
must
withdraw
gentlemen
said
the
lady
forbearingly
pray
forget
the
unhappy
scene
you
have
been
forced
to
witness
and
let
me
beg
of
you
for
this
poor
woman
sake
to
leave
all
further
pursuit
of
the
matter
entirely
in
my
hands
whilst
she
remains
in
this
establishment
i
must
continue
to
shield
her
from
the
penalties
to
which
she
insists
upon
exposing
herself
come
mary
dry
your
eyes
and
attend
to
your
duties
the
time
is
coming
when
you
will
thank
me
for
the
discipline
to
which
you
are
now
subjected
and
beaudesart
retired
greater
in
defeat
than
in

i
never
expected
anybody
to
put
a

on

faltered
ida
apologetically
after
a

silence

nelson
i

a

in
han
ida
dried
her
eyes
and
with
the
more
alacrity
forasmuch
as
an
approaching
step
crunched
the
gravel
outside
it
was
priestley
a
bullock
driver
who
had
drawn
up
to
the
store
on
the
a
decent
sort
of
vulgarian
but
altogether
too
industrious
to
get
any
further
forward
than
the
extreme
of
his
profession
some
carriers
never
learn
the
great
lesson
that
to
everything
there
is
a
time
and
a
season
a
time
for
work
and
a
time
for
repose
hence
you
find
the
industrious
man
inveterately
set
of
frames
in
hopeless
competition
with
the
judiciously
lazy
man
string
of
daisies
the
contrast
is
sickening
moreover
the
same
rule
holds
fairly
well
throughout
the
whole
region
of
industry
but
the
ca
see
it
he
is
too
furiously
busy
for
eighteen
hours
out
of
the
to
notice
that
even
in
the
most
literal
sense
loafing
has
a
more
intimate
connection
with
than
working
can
possibly
have
such
a
man
finds
himself
born
unto
trouble
as
the
sparks
fly
in
all
directions
but
he
is
merely
aware
of
undergoing
a
chastening
process
just
as
the
tethered
calf
is
aware
that
he
always
turns
a
flying
somersault
when
he
impetuously
charges
in
any
direction
away
from
his
peg
and
this
simply
because
the
man
knows
as
much
about
the
order
of
things
as
the
calf
knows
about
euclid
definition
of
a
radial
line
the
fact
is
that
the
order
of
things
rightly
understood
is
not
susceptible
of
any
coercion
whatever
and
must
be
humoured
in
every
possible
way
in
the
race
of
life
my
son
you
must
run
cunning
reserving
your
sprint
for
the
tactical
moment
priestley
ran
in
consequence
of
being
always
at
work
he
could
get
very
little
work
done
and
being
pursuantly
in
a
chronic
state
of
debt
and
destitution
he
got
only
the
work
that
intermittently
slothful
men
would
take
at
the
price
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
add
that
he
had
a
wife
and
about
thirteen
small
children
mostly
girls
mornin
chaps
said
this
plebeian
standing
between
the
wind
and
our
nobility
with
a
hand
on

hope

replied
the
young
storekeeper
i
know
you
always
want
to
get
away

chaps
continued
the
bullock
driver
advancing
into
the
room
and
glancing
confidentially
round
the
table
think
there
any
use
o
me
stickin
up
the
boss
for

to
take
the
to

i
could
make

then

i

i
have

if
i

through

what
do
you
think
chaps
why
did
you
take
this
into
consideration
when
you
loaded
demanded
young
arblaster
well
beggars
ai
choosers
replied
the
apostle
of
brute
force
and
ignorance
fact
was
arblaster
i
bethought
me
what
a
lot
o
work
i
done
for
magomery
one
time
or
another
an
what
good
friends

an
him
always

to
myself
i
chance

that
the
way
i
reasoned
it
out
see
if
i
got
to
turn

the

back
agen
to
the

an
take
the
nalrookar
track
from

i
wo

short
o
fifty

an
there
ai

the

et
right
into

ground
starve
a
locust
i
jubious
about
the
convincer
even
with
half
a
load
bullocks
too
weak
well
it
hardly
likely
the
boss
would
let
you
cross
the
run
replied
arblaster
he
be
a
d
d
fool
if
he
did
i
afraid
there
no
use
asking
him
priestley
added
nelson
he
make
a
thoroughfare
of
the
run
at
any
price
for
instance
when
baxter
and
donovan
delivered
that
in
the
quondong
paddock
the
other
day
they
were
five
mile
from
the
main
road
and
a
gate
to
go
through
but
he
made
them
come
right
back
by
the
station
thirty
mile
of
a
roundabout
and
their
cheques
were
forthcoming
till
they
did
it
no
priestley
to
ask
montgomery
is
simply
to
get
a
refusal
and
to
argue
with
him
is
simply
to
get
insulted
well
i
i
must
worry
through
some
road
said
the
bullock
driver
resignedly
as
he
turned
and
went
out
fifty
miles
instead
of
remarked
mooney
hard
enough
case
and
yet
it
necessary
in
a
sense
replied
nelson
same
time
anybody
except
the
like
of
montgomery
would
spring
a
bit
in
a
season
like
this
i
could
crush
a
poor
decent
devil
like
that
i
give
him
a
thorough
good
blackguarding
for
calculating
upon
crossing
the
run
and
then
as
a
matter
of
form
i
send
a
man
with
him
to
see
him
across
well
i
suppose
we
must
go
and
get
our
mot
d
ordre
boys
so
we
left
the
to
ida
the
four
narangies
with
the
practical
went
to
the
veranda
of
the
boss
house
for
their
day
orders
moriarty
with
a
ring
of
keys
in
his
hand
sauntered
across
to
the
store
and
i
managed
to
drag
myself
out
to
a
seat
built
against
the
south
side
of
the
barracks
whence
i
torpidly
surveyed
the
scene
around
whilst
listening
to
my
vitality
whistling
out
through
four
million
yawning
pores
in
an
open
shed
near
the
store
where
two
tribesmen
were
now
assisting
priestley
to
unload
a
travelling
saddler
and
salvationist
named
without
a
word
of
a

was
at
work
on
the
of
the
station
his
tilted
wagonette
blazoned
with
his
name
and
title
joseph
pawsome
saddler
standing
close
by
watching
these
lewd
fellows
of
the
baser
sort
at
their
sordid
toil
my
mind
reverted
to
certain
incidents
of
the
preceding
night
and
so
drifted
into
a
speculation
on
the
peculiar
kind
of
difficulties
which
at
certain
times
beset
certain
sojourners
on
the
rind
of
this
third
primary
orb
the
incidents
of
course
have
nothing
to
do
with
my
story
but
as
the
mere
mention
of
them
may
have
whetted
the
reader
curiosity
i
suppose
it
is
only
fair
to
satisfy
him
the
night
in
question
seemed
from
an
astrological
point
of
view
to
be
peculiarly
favourable
to
the
ascendancy
of
baleful
influences
the
moon
hung
above
the
western
horizon
in
her
most
formidable
phase
just
past
the
semicircle
with
her
gibbous
edge
malignantly
feathered
being
now
in
the
house
of
taurus
she
had
overborne
the
benignant
sway
of
aldebaran
and
was
pressing
hard
on
castor
and
pollux
in
the
house
of
gemini
also
her
horizontal
attitude
was
so
full
of
menace
that
rigel
and
betelgeux
in
orion
seemed
to
wilt
under
her
sinister
supremacy
sirius
in
canis
major
strongest
and
most
malevolent
of
the
astral
powers
hung
southwest
of
the
zenith
reinforcing
the
evil
bias
of
the
time
and
thus
from
his
commanding
position
overruling
the
guardianship
of
canopus
in
argo
of
the
same
point
lower
still
toward
the
south
achernar
seemed
to
reserve
his
gracious
prestige
whilst
across
the
invisible
pole
the
beneficent
constellations
of
crux
and
centaurus
exhibited
the
very
paralysis
of
hopelessness
worst
of
all
jupiter
and
mars
both
held
aloof
whilst
ascendant
saturn
mourned
in
the
house
of
cancer
such
was
the
wretched
aspect
of
the
heavens
to
my
debilitated
intelligence
as
i
slunk
home
from
the
toward
midnight
i
was
somewhat
comforted
to
observe
in
procyon
a
firmness
which
i
attributed
to
the
evident
support
of
regulus
in
the
house
of
leo
but
the
most
reassuring
element
in
an
extremely
baleful
horoscope
was
spica
in
the
house
of
virgo
scarcely
affected
by
the
moon
interference
and
now
ascending
confidently
from
the
eastern
horizon
still
to
my
mind
there
was
something
so
hopeless
in
the
lunar
and
stellar
outlook
that
for
comfort
i
turned
my
eyes
toward
the
station
cemetery
which
was
dimly
in
view
there
several
shapeless
forms
some
white
and
others
of
neutral
hue
seemed
to
be
moving
slowly
and
silently
amongst
the
dwellings
of
the
dead
as
if
holding
what
you
could
scarcely
call
a
carnival
in
their
own
sombre
way
the
time
the
place
the
supermundane
conditions
acting
together
on
a
mind
gave
to
the
whole
scene
a
weird
reality
which
writing
can
not
convey
so
after
pinching
myself
to
make
sure
i
was
awake
and
doing
a
small
sum
in
mental
arithmetic
to
verify
my
sanity
i
advanced
toward
the
perturbed
spirits
got
them
against
the
sky
and
identified
them
as
cattle
greedily
stevedoring
the
long
dry
grass
it
seemed
a
pity
to
turn
the
poor
hungry
animals
out
yet
i
knew
that
somebody
would
have
to
suffer
for
it
if
montgomery
knew
of
anything
trespassing
here
but
how
had
they
got
in
through
seven
wires

upper

good
night
ole
man
my
way
led
me
past
a
small
isolated
stable
used
exclusively
for
the
boss
nearing
this
building
i
heard
a
suppressed
commotion
inside
followed
by
soothing
gibberish
in
a
very
low
voice
this
was
bad
priestley
bullocks
were
within
easy
view
and
jerry
the
groom
was
a
notorious
master
man
i
must
have
a
friendly
yarn
with
him
what
up
with
you
this
hour
of
the
night
jerry
i
asked
looking
through
the
latticed
uneasy
conscience
i
bet
whilst
speaking
the
last
words
i
distinguished
montgomery
pair
of
greys
tied
one
in
each
back
corner
of
the
stable
whilst
pawsome
horses
a
white
and
a
piebald
were
occupying
the
two
stalls
and
voraciously
tearing
down
mouthfuls
of
good
victorian
hay
from
the
rack
above
the
manger
pawsome
silently
caressing
one
of
the
greys
moved
to
the
lattice
on
hearing
my
voice
work
i
suggested
in
a
whisper
sort
of
attempt
replied
the
wizard
in
the
same
key
you

all
the

out
two

an
i
med

everybody
was

they
are
i
only
been
down
for

collins

he

whispered
the
poor
necromancer
in
eager
fellowship
and
displaying
a
knowledge
of

rare
amongst
his
sect
god
bless
you
collins
may
we
meet
in
a
better
world
it
wo
be
difficult
to
do
that
i
replied
dejectedly
as
i
withdrew
to
enjoy
my
unearned
slumber
now
the
night
replete
with
such
was
past
and
the
cares
that
infest
the
day
had
returned
to
everyone
on
the
station
except
myself
and
two
or
three
equally
clean
useless
and
aristocratic
loafers
in
the
boss
house
toby
the
was
cantering
away
toward
clarke
for
the
weekly
mail
priestley
at
his
wagon
was
bullocking
even
more
desperately
than
usual
with
a
view
to
getting
out
of
sight
of
the
station
as
soon
as
possible
pawsome
repairing
a
on
his
extemporised
bench
was
softly
crooning
a
familiar
hymn
the
sentiment
of
which
seemed
appropriate
to
himself
whilst
the
language
breathed
the
very
aroma
of
his
social
atmosphere
must
i
be
carried
to
the
skies
on
flowery
beds
of
ease
while
others
fought
to
gain
the
prize
and
sail
through
adj
seas
in
the
veranda
of
the
house
folkestone
a
young
english
gentleman
of
not
less
than
two
lolled
on
a
hammock
smoking
a
chibouque
and
reading
a
magazine
while
straight
between
us
two
aristocratic
loafers
vandemonian
jack
aged
about
a
century
was
mechanically
sawing
firewood
in
the
hot
sickly
sunshine
this
is
one
of
the
jobs
that
it
takes
a
man
of
four
or
five
score
years
to
perform
ungrudgingly
and
to
any
illuminated
mind
the
secret
of
these
old
fellows
greatness
is
very
plain
bathing
though
an
ancient
heresy
has
been
of
strictly
local
prevalence
and
for
the
best
of
reasons
of
transient
continuance
our
relapse
belongs
to
the
present
generation
though
our
grandsires
understood
no
science
unconnected
with
the
gloves
a
marvellous
instinct
taught
them
the
unwholesomeness
of
sluicing
away
that
panoply
of
dirt
which
is
nature
own
defence
against
the
microbe
of
imbecility
and
which
indeed
was
the
only
armour
worn
by
the
formidable
berserkers
from
whom
some
of
them
claimed
descent
we
have
done
it
however
at
least
we
say
so
whilst
our
social
inferiors
have
held
on
to
the
religion
at
least
we
say
so
here
again
wherefore
i
say
collins
faltered
ida
breaking
in
on
my
reflections
i
picked
up
this
little
buckle
aside
o
your
it
come
off
o
the
back
o
your
tr
rs
i
sew
it
on
for
you
any
time
for
i
notice
bothered
with
them
slippin
down
o
mr
collins
and
the
poor
unlovely
face
was
suddenly
distorted
with
anguish
and
wet
with
tears
ai
bodyzart
wicked
to
put
a
slur
on
me
like
that
there
ai
one
word
o
truth
in
it
i
say
the
same
if
i
was
to
die
an
you
may
believe
me
or
believe
me
not
but
i
tellin
the
truth
far
be
it
indeed
hush
stop
crying
ida
do
look
round
beaudesart
watching
you
from
the
window
over
there
you
poor
thing
you
should
trouble
yourself
over
what
anybody
says
did
you
feed
pup
this
morning
i
give
him
a
whole
full
o
scraps
but
if
people
tells
the
truth
there
nobody
in
the
world
can
say
black
is
the
white
o
my
eye
an
you
may
believe
me
or
believe
me
not
you
need
to
give
pup
a
drink
ida
he
got
a
dish
o
good
aside
him
but
if
people
would
consider
true
very
true
now
go
away
dear
and
do
come
fooling
about
me
or
you
give
her
liberty
to
talk
the
girl
limped
back
to
the
scene
of
her
unromantic
martyrdom
and
i
made
a
feeble
effort
to
shake
the
from
my
mane
and
so
to
speak
look
myself
in
the
face
i
must
give
this
life
over
i
thought
and
i
will
give
it
over
an
i
do
not
i
am
a
villain
after
all
there
are
not
two
sides
to
this
question
there
is
only
one
and
you
may
trust
an
overclean
man
to
be
an
authority
on
the
evil
effects
of
bathing
upon
mind
body
and
estate
just
as
the
grogbibber
is
our
highest
authority
on
headaches
fantods
and
bankruptcy
the
spartans
so
ran
my
reflections
were
as
much
addicted
to
dirt
as
the
sybarites
to
cleanliness
and
just
compare
the
two
communities
the
conquering
races
of
later
ages
goths
huns
vandals
longobards
were
no
less
celebrated
for
one
kind
of
grit
than
for
the
other
it
is
the
turkish
bath
that
has
made
the
ottoman
empire
the
sick
man
of
europe
latifundia
perdidere
italian
large
estates
ruined
italy
yes
blame
it
on
the
large
estates
would
a
large
estate
ruin
you
bathing
did
the
business
for
italy
as
it
does
the
business
for
all
its
victims
if
rome
had
left
to
the
soft
capuan
his
baths
and
his
perfumes
she
would
have
but
think
of
the
polished
roman
debating
the
question
of
survival
with
the
superlatively
dirty
barbarian
of
the
north
polished
is
good
for
in
the
ruins
of
the
fatal
roman
baths
the
innumerable
strigulae
used
by
the
bathers
to
polish
their
skins
bear
sad
testimony
to
the
suicidal
cleanliness
of
that
doomed
race
and
just
compare
your
roman
morally
and
physically
with
his
contemporary
the
anchorite
of
the
thebaid
the
former
flickering
briefly
in
a
puerile
way
and
going
out
with
a
sulphurous
smell
the
latter
on
a
ration
of
six
dates
per
week
attaining
an
interminable
longevity
and
possessing
the
power
of
striking
scoffers
dead
or
blind
or
paralytic
at
pleasure
and
talking
of
hermits
do
you
think
peter
of
picardy
could
have
launched
the
muscular
christianity
of
western
europe
against
the
less
muscular
because
cleaner
islamism
of
western
asia
but
for
his
vow
never
to
change
his
clothes
nor
wash
himself
till
his
contract
should
be
completed
prouder
in
his
rags
than
the
emperor
in
his
purple
and
justly
too
for
he
achieved
the
very
apotheosis
of
dirt
animate
no
doubt
as
well
as
inanimate
or
take
the
first
teutonic
emperor
of
rome
conqueror
arbitrator
legislator
and
what
not
in
those
middle
ages
you
know
it
was
the
custom
to
name
monarchs
from
some
peculiarity
of
person
or
habitude
and
i
put
it
to
any
reasonable
soul
was
this
mere
yarman
brince
likely
to
have
become
the
central
figure
of
the
century
but
for
such
rigid
abstinence
from
external
application
of
water
as
is
implied
in
the
significant
name
of
otto
the
great
indeed
the
most
sweepingly
appropriate
bestowal
of
the
title
is
made
when
we
refer
to
the
adherents
of
the
collectively
as
the
great
unwashed
again
johnson
biographies
lovingly
preserve
the
personal
habits
of
most
of
the
loftiest
and
sweetest
poets
that
ever
trod
english
soil
and
think
what
a
large
percentage
of
those
according
to
their
historian
carried
a
fair
quantity
of
that
soil
perennially
on
their
hides
and
speaking
of
the
diogenes
of
fleet
street
himself
we
know
on
good
authority
that
his
antipathy
to
the
order
of
the
bath
caused
him
to
appeal
to
more
senses
than
one
he
was
another
otto
the
great
the
original
diogenes
by
the
way
revelled
in
dirt
as
well
as
in
wisdom
and
the
mighty
scholar
porson
as
you
may
remember
never
needed
to
wash
because
he
never
perspired
yet
in
spite
of
this
cloud
of
witness
and
in
the
face
of
our
own
experience
we
will
entice
external
leakage
of
such
incipient
greatness
as
we
have
soaking
ourselves
in
water
as
if
we
were
possums
and
our
virility
a
eucalyptus
flavour
that
we
sought
to
dissipate
look
at
myself
now
a
king
now
thus
have
i
fallen
so
low
and
yet
i
was
once
like
our
otto
and
before
touching
the
forbidden
thing
i
felt
as
if
i
wanted
to
pursue
an
inspiring
if
purposeless
journey
up
uncomfortable
alpine
heights
with
my
in
my
hand
and
a
tear
in
my
solitary
bright
blue
eye
now
the
maiden
invitation
seems
to
be
the
only
part
of
the
enterprise
that
has
any
pith
in
it
then
i
gloried
in
the
fiendish
adage
of
hours
sleep
for
a
man
three
for
a
woman
and
four
for
a
fool
now
my
livelist
ambition
is
to
gaze
my
fill
on
yon
calm
deep
then
like
an
infant
sink
asleep
on
this
form
and
so
remain
till
i
should
say
belonging
as
i
do
to
the
better
classes
then
i
was
like
hotspur
on
his
roan
now
i
merely
wish
the
desert
were
my
with
one
fair
spirit
for
my
minister
to
confess
the
truth
i
note
a
certain
weak
glimmer
of
investing
the
thought
that
i
would
be
content
with
one
fair
spirit
got
to
go
to
by
virtue
thou
enforcest
laughter
i
wish
i
was
as
happy
as
you
murmured
ida
who
had
again
silently
approached
here
two
newspapers
they
done
with
them
in
the
house
o
mr
collins
and
the
girl
tears
broke
forth
afresh
whilst
ungovernable
sobs
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
i
ca
git
it
off
o
my
mind
what
bodyzart
said
ida
ida
i
remonstrated
you
making
your
nose
red
the
information
acted
like
a
charm
her
crying
was
over
though
she
still
persisted
in
chewing
her
grievance
i
can
prove
there
ai
one
word
o
truth
in
it
she
continued
pertinaciously
what
your
idea
of
proof
ida
i
can
prove
it
on
the
bible
she
replied
eagerly
that
settles
the
matter
beyond
controversy
considering
that
you
rightly
belong
to
the
middle
ages
indeed
i
do
she
replied
with
a
flash
of
resentment
i
was
last
birthday
an
i
do
care
who
knows
it
on
the
third
of
july
it
was
an
i
would
care
tuppence
if
her
ladyship
snoke
roun
people
i
was
forty
but
to
put
a
slur
on
me
like
that
i
leave
it
to
your
own
self
collins
was
it
right
right
i
repeated
wearily
in
heaven
name
girl
what
does
it
signify
to
you
whether
it
was
right
or
otherwise
that
own
business
not
yours
why
if
she
charged
me
with
stooping
to
folly
i
would
merely
say
to
undeceive
you
but
i
been
too
much
given
to
letting
i
dare
not
wait
upon
i
would
like
the
poor
bandicoot
i
the
adage
but
i
certainly
should
concern
myself
with
a
question
lying
entirely
between
herself
and
saint
peter
ah
but
you
different
replied
the
girl
sadly
simply
because
i
a
philosopher
ida
i
held
communion
with
the
unfathomable
and
watched
the
exfoliation
of
the
inscrutable
and
you
know
these
things
are
altogether
beyond
the
orbit
of
the
now
clear
off
like
a
good
fellow
and
let
me
read
the
papers
but
i
was
too
far
gone
to
take
any
interest
in
either
of
the
loathsome
contemporanes
too
much
afflicted
even
to
drift
down
to
the
again
much
as
i
desired
to
do
so
i
also
longed
for
the
opinion
of
my
mighty
pipe
on
the
but
that
faithful
ally
was
packed
among
my
things
forty
feet
away
and
it
might
as
well
have
been
forty
miles
so
i
just
lay
on
the
seat
clean
frail
and
inert
as
a
recumbent
statue
moulded
in
whilst
the
ancient
oscillated
his
frame
saw
and
the
pious
pawsome
lightened
his
toil
with
selections
from
sankey
and
the
perspiring
priestley
hurried
up
his
bullocks
from
the
and
sling
muck
the
gardener
used
his
hoe
among
the
callots
and
cabbagee
with
the
automatic
stroke
of
a
man
brought
up
to
one
holiday
per
annum
and
no
sunday
meanwhile
the
unreturning
sands
of
life
dribbled
through
the
unheeded
isthmus
of
the
present
moment
and
the
fixed
cone
of
the
past
expanded
and
the
dimple
deepened
in
the
diminished
and
hurrying
future
nevertheless
i
collected
the
wreckage
of
what
had
been
very
fair
faculties
and
attempted
to
grapple
with
an
idea
which
ida
conversation
had
suggested
finding
this
impossible
i
made
a
mental
memo
of
the
inspiration
and
by
the
same
token
i
neatly
utilised
it
within
the
next
few
hours
your
attention
will
be
drawn
to
the
circumstance
in
due
season
at
the
bell
sounded
from
the
hut
pawsome
and
the
tribesmen
quitted
their
work
and
went
to
dinner
priestley
had
started
an
hour
before
bound
for
nalrooka
with
the
remaining
half
of
his
load
all
the
levites
except
moriarty
were
out
on
the
run
but
martin
the
head
boundary
rider
had
timed
himself
for
lunch
this
man
status
was
a
vexed
question
he
certainly
rated
but
did
he
rate
high
enough
for
the
barracks
as
head
boundary
man
decidedly
not
but
as
recent
proprietor
of
a
small
station
absorbed
by
runnymede
he
was
not
destitute
of
pretensions
out
in
the
open
air
he
was
of
course
as
good
as
any
levite
but
well
though
we
rather
resented
his
presence
in
the
inner
court
we
yielded
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
he
took
that
benefit
just
as
if
he
had
been
born
in
the
purple
like
ourselves
martin
was
an
orangeman
of
rank
he
had
attained
the
black
degree
it
was
whispered
that
he
held
all
the
loyal
brethren
of
riverina
under
the
whip
by
reason
of
his
being
the
only
man
in
the
region
beyond
the
murrumbidgee
who
could
confer
the
purple
degree
for
owing
to
an
inherent
haziness
in
the
theses
and
aims
of
orangeism
there
are
orders
in
the
society
as
hard
to
attain
as
those
german
university
degrees
which
no
man
ever
took
and
had
his
eyesight
perfect
afterward
though
to
be
sure
there
is
a
certain
difference
in
the
relative
value
of
the
two
species
of
attainment
moriarty
whose
front
name
was
felix
was
if
anything
a
catholic
and
partly
on
this
account
partly
on
account
of
his
being
a
young
fellow
and
partly
on
account
of
miss
king
the
governess
martin
set
him
now
there
was
just
one
man
within
a
hundred
miles
who
knew
less
of
irish
history
than
martin
and
that
man
was
moriarty
consequently
the
two
jostled
each
other
as
they
rushed
into
that
branch
of
learning
where
scholars
fear
to
tread
each
repeatedly
appealing
to
me
for
confirmation
of
his
outlandish
myths
and
clumsy
fabrications
i
listlessly
confirmed
anything
and
everything
having
lost
all
mental
as
well
as
physical
energy
where
king
john
lost
his
regalia
namely
in
the
wash
the
line
of
least
resistance
was
the
line
for
me
after
a
hearty
lunch
i
made
my
way
back
to
the
seat
against
the
wall
while
moriarty
lounged
across
to
the
store
and
martin
went
to
speak
to
the
high
priest
at
the
door
of
the
sanctum
sanctorum
then
martin
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
and
presently
the
tribesman
jerry
brought
a
buggy
and
pair
to
the
front
door
montgomery
and
folkestone
the
latter
in
knickerbockers
took
their
seats
in
the
buggy
and
whirled
away
down
the
fence
then
all
was
still
save
for
the
faint
of
a
piano
in
the
holy
of
holies
whom
have
we
here
moriarty
to
disturb
me
let
him
come
it
is
meat
and
drink
to
me
to
see
a
clown
by
my
faith
we
that
have
good
wits
have
much
to
answer
for
we
shall
be
flouting
we
can
not
the
young
levite
closing
the
door
of
the
store
behind
him
advanced
with
the
indescribably
weary
step
of
a
station
man
when
the
day
is
warm
and
the
boss
absent
and
seated
himself
by
my
side
why
ai
you
in
the
barracks
having
one
of
your
quiet
palavers
with
mrs
beaudesart
he
asked
prithee
be
silent
boy
i
profit
not
by
thy
talk
i
murmured
something
i
wanted
to
ask
you
collins
he
resumed
but
i
beggared
if
i
can
think
what
it
is
slipped
away
like
a
snake
while
you
looking
round
for
a
stick
singular
how
a
person
ca
remember
a
thing
for
the
life
of
them
when
once
they
forget
it
and
suddenly
it
crops
up
of
its
own
accord
when
you
not
thinking
of
it
parse
that
said
i
listlessly
parse
your
granny
he
retorted
i
do
believe
you
could
parse
it
yourself
as
clever
as
you
think
you
are
beggar
conceitedness
beggar
everything
i
wish
i
was
about
forty
and
know
as
much
as
you
do
now
i
barely
articulated
yes
and
know
as
much
as
i
do
now
he
repeated
doggedly
in
fact
i
never
met
anyone
that
knows
as
much
as
i
do
but
people
wo
pay
any
attention
to
a
young
fellow
no
matter
if
he
was
solomon
that
martin
wants
a
lift
under
the
ear
does
he
i
asked
faintly
i
did
hear
him
express
the
desire
gosh
you
been
on
the
turkey
you
be
cutting
yourself
some
of
these
times
i
wish
toby
was
back
with
the
mail
i
hope
he
forget
to
ask
for
your
letters
now
the
lord
lighten
thee
thou
art
a
great
fool
i
sighed
what
time
does
toby
generally
get
back
any
time
between
two
in
the
afternoon
and
sunrise
next
morning
according
to
the
state
of
the
mailman
horses
beggar
such
a
life
as
this
at
it
early
and
late
working
through
accounts
and
rations
and
one
thing
or
another
and
no
more
chance
of
distinguishing
myself
than
if
i
was
in
jail
i
ca
stand
it
much
longer
and
what
more
i
wo
i
wish
the
mail
was
in
i
got
a
presentiment
of
something
good
this
time
if
you
do
speculate
you
wo
accumulate
as
the
saying
is
and
if
a
man
ca
make
a
rise
by
some
sort
of
gambling
he
may
as
well
lie
down
and
die
but
the
first
rise
is
the
difficulty
and
of
course
you
got
to
take
the
risk
what
do
you
do
with
the
rise
when
you
get
it
i
asked
drowsily
why
distinguish
yourself
of
course
what
else
there
a
great
future
sticking
out
for
a
fellow
if
he
got
his
head
screwed
on
right
so
there
is
well
what
shall
it
be
mechanics
fine
opening
for
an
inventive
genius
there
but
you
must
be
up
and
doing
as
the
poet
says
you
had
all
the
chances
when
you
were
my
age
replied
moriarty
bitterly
i
too
late
arriving
everything
invented
now
true
i
observed
i
had
thought
of
that
objection
then
why
not
take
up
some
interesting
study
and
work
it
out
from
post
to
finish
political
economy
for
instance
anybody
could
do
that
replied
the
young
fellow
contemptuously
i
want
to
distinguish
myself
then
i
tell
you
what
you
do
moriarty
take
a
narrow
branch
of
some
scientific
study
and
restrict
yourself
to
that
say
you
devote
your
life
to
some
special
division
of
the
formicae
the
what
formicae
the
name
is
plural
it
embraces
all
the
different
species
of
ants
why
there
only
about
three
species
of
ants
altogether
and
there
nothing
to
learn
about
them
except
that
they
make
different
kinds
of
hills
and
give
different
kinds
of
bites
that
sort
of
study
would
about
suit
you
fat
lot
of
distinction
a
person
could
get
out
of
ants
still
every
avenue
to
distinction
is
not
closed
i
urged
we
knocking
at
the
gates
of
futurity
for
the
australian
pioneer
of
poetry
fiction
philosophy
what
not
you
got
all
the
working
plant
ready
in
your
office
there
you
are
no
use
collins
he
replied
hopelessly
i
got
the
talent
right
enough
but
i
have
got
the
patience
in
fact
i
too
dash
lazy
charge
it
on
the
brother
i
sighed
no
i
ca
very
well
do
that
i
have
been
there
for
the
last
month
i
go
if
i
had
a
horse
heavens
above
i
murmured
what
would
he
be
like
if
he
was
clean
he
would
distinguish
himself
in
one
direction
the
material
is
there
jealousy
jealousy
replied
moriarty
disgustedly
never
mind
i
make
things
hum
yet
do
you
know
i
stand
to
win
notes
on
the
regatta
besides
my
chance
of
the
station
sweep
on
the
big
flemington
let
alone
private
bets
we
get
news
of
both
events
and
i
have
a
presentiment
of
something
good
gosh
i
wish
toby
was
here
and
how
much
do
you
stand
to
lose
if
your
mozzle
is
out
i
asked
did
i
incidentally
hear
that
you
were
playing
cards
all
last
sunday
i
do
believe
that
has
anything
to
do
with
it
replied
moriarty
in
an
altered
tone
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
dare
count
up
how
much
i
lose
if
things
go
crooked
i
plunged
too
heavy
there
no
doubt
about
that
but
i
did
it
with
the
best
intention
i
made
sure
of
scooping
and
for
that
matter
i
make
sure
of
it
still
but
whatever
you
do
do
begin
to
preach
about
the
evils
of
gambling
not
now
collins
not
till
after
we
get
news
of
these
events
does
everybody
gamble
from
the
governor
downward
bar
you
and
a
couple
or
three
more
sanctimonious
old
hypocrites
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
and
the
other
in
the
devil
mouth
why
nosey
alf
is
the
only
fellow
on
this
station
that
has
no
interest
in
the
sweep
besides
no
end
of
private
bets
is
that
toby
i
asked
indicating
a
horseman
away
gosh
yes
replied
moriarty
nervously
i
wonder
what
brings
him
from
that
direction
come
collins
will
you
give
me
five
to
one
he
has
letters
for
you
i
take
it
at
that
indeed
you
wo
sonny
well
let
have
some
wager
before
he
gets
any
nearer
persisted
moriarty
with
an
unpleasant
laugh
the
suspense
was
beginning
to
tell
upon
a
mind
not
originally
cast
in
the
stoic
mould
so
much
so
that
i
felt
inclined
to
lose
a
trifle
to
him
even
as
a
teetotaller
would
administer
a
nip
to
a
man
who
was
beginning
to
see
things
come
he
continued
recklessly
i
give
you
two
to
one
he
has
letters
for
you
twenty
to
one
he
has
letters
for
the
station
and
so
he
gabbled
on
whilst
drifting
into
my
i
charted
the
poor
fellow
mind
for
my
own
edification
hold
on
moriarty
i
interrupted
recalling
myself
let
hear
that
offer
again
am
i
to
understand
that
if
toby
has
letters
for
the
station
and
none
for
me
you
win
if
he
has
letters
for
me
and
none
for
the
station
i
win
and
failing
the
fulfilment
of
either
double
the
wager
is
off
that
it
are
you
on
make
it
a
hundred
to
one
done
at
a
hundred
to
one
in
what
i
replied
feeling
for
the
purse
which
vulgar
as
it
is
bushmen
even
of
aristocratic
lineage
are
compelled
to
carry
i
placed
the
little
coin
about
of
my
total
wealth
in
moriarty
hand
he
shrank
from
the
touch
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
petulantly
i
might
win
it
after
all
do
be
more
disagreeable
than
you
can
help
you
intend
to
get
it
without
giving
an
equivalent
do
you
you
know
it
yours
are
you
betting
on
a
certainty
lay
it
on
the
if
you
like
and
pick
it
up
when
you
can
read
your
title
clear
if
you
do
speculate
you
wo
accumulate
and
i
suppose
you
no
objection
to
looking
into
the
morality
of
your
speculation
i
had
cleared
my
throat
for
a
disquisition
which
would
have
been
intolerable
to
the
unprincipled
reader
when
a
very
curious
thing
arrested
the
attention
both
of
moriarty
and
myself
the
strangest
coincidence
perhaps
within
the
personal
experience
of
either
of
us
a
conjuncture
in
fact
which
for
a
moment
threw
us
both
staggering
back
on
the
theology
of
childhood
at
the
present
time
i
feel
too
meek
to
attempt
any
unravelment
and
too
haughty
to
offer
any
apology
other
than
that
such
is
life
the
had
cantered
up
to
the
gate
had
dismounted
had
divested
his
horse
of
the
saddle
and
bridle
and
had
given
the
animal
a
slap
with
the
latter
now
he
was
depositing
those
equipments
in
the
shed
now
he
approached
us
taking
two
letters
and
a
newspaper
from
the
of
what
had
once
been
an
expensive
of
montgomery
yours
collins
said
he
do
say
i
never
gave
you
nothing
nix
for
you
mr
adj
moriarty
you
very
laconic
observed
the
storekeeper
in
a
hollow
voice
yet
eyeing
the
prince
sternly
very
laconic
indeed
i
must
say
if
i
was
you
i
would
be
quite
so
laconic
how
the
sheol
comes
it
that
you
did
fetch
the
mail
need
look
in
that
paper
for
the
flemington
collins
said
the
she
a
day
too
soon
i
took
a
squint
at
her
comin
along
i
was
asking
how
the
adj
sheol
you
managed
to
come
without
the
mail
repeated
moriarty
with
dignity
i
heard
you
right
enough
i
ai
deaf
well
i
come
on
a
moke
think
i
padded
it
fact
was
moriarty

this
station

my
bit
o
filthy
lucre

out
o
your
pocket
i
got
great
pleasure
informin
you
i
met
ole
gladstone
comin
to
tell
us
the
same
yarn
anything
else
you
want
to
know
did
you
hear
which
crew
won
the
regatta
asked
moriarty
almost
civilly
sydney
replied
the
prince
think
you
port
phillipers
could
lick
us
that
a
lie
exclaimed
moriarty
catching
his
breath
right
it
a
lie
if
you
like
i
got
no
stuff
on
it
see
what
paper
says
an
now
i
feel
like
as
if
i
could
do
a
bit
o
dinner
unless
you
got
any
objections
he
stalked
away
toward
the
hut
whilst
i
opened
what
turned
out
to
be
a
evidently
intended
for
some
other
member
of
our
diffusive
clan
for
i
could
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
it
nothing
indeed
but
heart
and
such
heart
as
it
has
never
been
my
luck
to
capture
meanwhile
moriarty
had
cut
the
string
of
the
newspaper
and
was
running
his
eye
over
its
columns
my
mozzle
is
out
collins
said
he
with
an
effort
i
never
clear
myself
never
in
the
creation
of
cats
it
all
up
yes
you
suffer
by
comparison
with
the
sanctimonious
old
hypocrites
now
i
replied
in
a
fatherly
tone
as
i
took
the
from
the
feel
something
like
an
overproof
idiot
do
you
we
talk
about
that
presently
but
see
what
i
got
here
my
second
letter
ran
no
central
office
of
unconsidered
trifles
sydney
february
collins
sir
i
am
directed
to
inform
you
that
the
purposes
visiting
nyngan
on
the

are
required
to
attend
the

of
the
department
in
that
township
at
on
the
day
above
mentioned
to
furnish
any
information
which
he
may
require
i
am
sir
ynnnnnnnnnnly
mmmnnynnlnny
pro
not
a
whisper
about
the
i
remarked
perhaps
it
in
your
mail
no
odds
montgomery
can
complete
it
and
send
it
on
just
as
well
as
if
i
had
been
near
the
place
at
all
but
here
something
like
two
hundred
and
thirty
miles
to
be
done
in
seven
days
and
the
country
in
such
a
state
this
is
the
balsam
that
the
usuring
senate
pours
into
captains
wounds
never
mind
the
time
is
only
too
near
when
i
sit
in
my
sumptuous
office
retaliating
all
this
on
some
future
and
in
the
meantime
this
long
dusty
ride
will
make
a
man
of
me
once
more
i
must
start
at
once
and
i
could
do
with
some
money
moriarty
you
owing
me
fifty
notes
i
know
i
am
replied
the
storekeeper
in
a
quivering
voice
he
was
as
punctiliously
honourable
in
some
ways
as
he
was
perfidious
in
others
being
amiably
asinine
in
each
extreme
now
including
your
little
liability
to
me
how
much
are
you
out
even
if
the
flemington
gamble
goes
in
your
favour
i
asked
only
notes
he
faltered
i
clear
it
right
enough
if
i
not
rushed
and
if
i
do
get
the
sack
off
the
station
but
by
every
rule
of
analogy
you
also
badly
left
on
the
flemington
i
continued
serenely
how
much
does
that
leave
you
out
notes
and
my
rifle
he
replied
steadying
his
voice
by
an
effort
i
wish
i
were
dead
will
you
swear
of
gambling
altogether
till
my
claim
is
discharged
on
that
condition
i
can
extend
the
time
say
to
the
greek
kalends
if
you
think
i
could
raise
the
money
by
that
time
replied
the
poor
fellow
dubiously
anyway
i
give
you
my
solemn
promise
but
i
say
he
continued
with
seeming
irrelevance
when
do
you
expect
promotion
at
any
moment
my
presentiments
being
based
on
the
deepest
inductions
of
science
and
the
subtlest
intuitions
of
the
higher
philosophy
are
a
trifle
more
trustworthy
than
yours
and
i
have
a
presentiment
that
the
thing
is
impending
but
you
need
congratulate
me
yet
think
about
yourself
that
just
what
i
doing
if
you
tell
her
about
this
wager
i
suicide
or
clear
well
upon
my
word
do
you
think
i
condescend
to
undermine
you
you
storekeeper
look
out
for
martin
never
mind
me
i
do
mean
her
mumbled
the
young
fool
i
mean
beaudesart
you
going
to
marry
her
when
you
get
your
promotion
ai
you
there
was
such
evident
sincerity
in
his
tone
that
i
maintained
a
stern
and
stony
silence
whilst
his
eyes
met
mine
with
a
doubtful
deprecating
look
then
he
remarked
doggedly
well
that
what
she
told
montgomery
last
sunday
and
she
said
it
seriously
miss
king
was
present
at
the
time
and
she
told
butler
and
mooney
and
me
across
the
gate
of
the
the
same
evening
beaudesart
takes
it
for
granted
and
so
does
everybody
else
she
says
she
accepted
you
some
time
ago
you
lying
dog
i
remarked
wearily
i
hope
i
may
never
stir
alive
off
this
seat
if
i
not
telling
you
the
exact
truth
ask
mooney
or
butler
if
i
do
sleep
would
all
my
wealth
would
wake
me
i
murmured
you
do
want
to
marry
her
then
after
all
how
long
do
you
suppose
i
would
last
well
do
marry
her
does
it
occur
to
you
i
asked
with
some
bitterness
that
there
are
some
things
a
person
can
do
and
some
things
he
ca
do
if
the
head
of
my
department
orders
me
to
nyngan
i
can
reply
by
letter
telling
him
to
mind
his
own
business
and
not
concern
himself
about
me
but
if
beaudesart
assumes
if
she
merely
takes
for
granted
that
i
going
to
marry
her
i
must
do
it
to
keep
her
in
countenance
how
in
the
name
can
i
slink
out
of
it
now
that
i
accepted
can
i
tell
her
i
examined
my
heart
and
i
find
i
can
only
love
her
as
a
sister
now
would
that
sound
well
no
no
i
a
done
man
of
course
she
had
no
business
to
accept
me
unawares
but
as
she
has
done
so
i
must
help
her
to
keep
up
the
grisly
fraud
of
feminine
reluctance
for
as
the
abbot
sings
so
must
the
sacristan
respond
it
is
kismet
this
is
how
all
these
unaccountable
marriages
are
brought
about
though
to
be
sure
i
have
the
dubious
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
the
enterprise
brings
me
a
good
many
days
march
nearer
home
the
expression
of
heavenly
beatitude
on
moriarty
face
goaded
my
mind
to
activity
sweeping
with
one
glance
the
whole
horizon
of
expediency
and
possibility
i
caught
sight
of
the
idea
glanced
at
in
a
former
page
and
suggested
you
will
remember
by
my
dialogue
with
ida
by
the
way
moriarty
said
i
respecting
that
trifling
debt
of
honour
there
another
condition
that
i
did
think
of
as
a
sort
of
payment
on
account
you
must
privately
and
insidiously
circulate
a
very
grave
scandal
for
me
well
i
wo
exclaimed
the
young
fellow
after
a
moment
pause
i
do
mind
telling
a
lie
when
i
driven
to
it
but
a
woman
a
woman
do
your
own
dirty
work
then
by
jove
i
post
you
if
anyone
had
used
this
threat
to
me
i
would
have
asked
how
the
posting
was
usually
done
and
what
results
might
be
expected
to
follow
but
lip
quivered
under
the
threat
do
your
worst
said
he
swallowing
the
lump
in
his
throat
you
may
depend
on
that
i
replied
quietly
however
the
scandal
was
only
about
myself
i
do
understand
i
enlighten
you
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
take
nelson
or
mooney
or
both
of
them
into
your
confidence
then
you
would
arrange
that
beaudesart
should
overhear
you
discussing
some
horrible
scandal
in
connection
with
me
and
mind
she
would
have
to
believe
it
or
you
would
be
a
ruined
man
for
the
rest
of
your
life
you
would
be
a
defaulting
gambler
a
byword
a
hissing
an
astonishment
with
the
curse
of
cain
upon
your
brow
then
she
would
spurn
me
with
contumely
and
i
would
be
my
own
man
again
i
would
be
in
sanctuary
so
to
speak
inviolable
by
reason
of
my
disgrace
metaphorically
you
could
lay
the
blast
and
fire
it
at
your
leisure
in
my
absence
i
would
leave
all
details
to
your
own
judgment
only
holding
you
responsible
for
quality
of
fuse
and
quantity
of
powder
i
stand
the
explosion
i
on
exclaimed
moriarty
brightening
up
gosh
i
give
you
a
character
to
rights
mind
it
make
you
look
small
the
smaller
the
better
i
have
a
small
aperture
to
crawl
through
and
no
other
means
of
escape
of
course
being
innocent
all
the
time
the
scandal
wo
even
fizz
on
my
inner
consciousness
in
fact
i
feel
myself
taking
a
rise
out
of
everyone
that
believes
the
yarn
and
live
it
down
in
good
time
now
lay
your
plans
carefully
moriarty
and
make
a
clean
job
of
it
for
your
own
sake
this
being
definitely
settled
i
soon
demonstrated
to
the
young
fellow
that
his
case
as
regarded
other
liabilities
was
by
no
means
desperate
and
his
elastic
temperament
asserted
itself
at
once
i
may
add
in
passing
that
he
has
never
broken
his
pledge
also
that
my
remains
unpaid
to
this
day
now
i
must
go
and
catch
my
horses
said
i
can
you
come
hold
on
replied
moriarty
here
comes
toby
we
send
him
as
the
lounged
out
of
the
front
door
of
the
hut
the
cook
went
out
by
the
back
door
and
gathered
an
armful
of
firewood
toby
turned
and
glided
back
into
the
hut
and
a
moment
later
the
cook
also
at
the
opposite
side
then
the
prince
bounded
out
through
the
front
door
with
a
triumphant
grin
on
his
brown
face
and
an
enormous
cockroach
of
black
sugar
in
his
hand
the
next
moment
a
piece
of
firewood
whizzed
through
the
open
door
smote
full
on
love
of
approbation
ricochetted
from
his
skull
and
banged
against
the
weatherboard
wall
of
an
will
yo
ever
go
home
i
dunno
laughed
the
prince
picking
up
his
hat
while
the
baffled
cook
recovered
his
stick
and
returned
to
the
hut
now
what
the
use
of
arguing
that
a
blackfellow
belongs
to
the
human
race
queried
moriarty
the
last
ripple
of
trouble
having
vanished
from
the
serene
shallowness
of
his
mind
that
welt
would
have
laid
one
of
us
out
and
did
you
ever
notice
that
a
blackfellow
or
a
can
always
clear
himself
when
his
horse
comes
down
the
first
thing
a
whitefellow
thinks
about
when
he
feels
his
horse
gone
is
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
what
coming
but
it
an
even
wager
that
he
pinned
never
so
with
the
inferior
race
now
last
boxing
day
when
we
had
races
here
we
could
see
that
the
main
event
rested
between
admiral
rodney
a
big
chestnut
belonging
to
a
cove
on
a
visit
to
the
boss
with
toby
in
the
saddle
and
that
grey
of
admiral
crichton
with
repeat
that
last
name
please
admiral
that
slews
you
did
i
tell
you
you
be
cutting
yourself
it
own
pronunciation
and
if
he
does
know
the
proper
twang
i
dash
well
sure
you
do
for
he
owns
the
horse
but
was
it
a
curious
coincidence
of
name
considering
that
neither
the
owners
nor
the
horses
had
ever
met
before
well
young
jack
was
to
ride
admiral
crichton
and
i
had
such
faith
in
the
horse
with
jack
up
that
i
plunged
thundering
heavy
on
him
so
did
nelson
but
by
jingo
the
more
we
saw
of
admiral
rodney
the
more
frightened
we
got
in
fact
we
could
see
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
stiffen
toby
toby
was
to
get
a
note
if
he
won
the
big
event
and
nothing
if
he
lost
but
it
paid
us
to
give
him
two
notes
to
run
cronk
one
moment
i
interrupted
just
oblige
me
with
the
name
and
address
of
that
horse
owner
it
blown
over
now
but
as
i
was
telling
you
the
chestnut
had
been
a
few
times
round
the
course
under
the
owner
eye
and
he
knew
the
road
and
to
make
matters
better
you
might
break
the
reins
but
you
could
get
a
give
out
of
his
mouth
and
he
could
travel
like
a
so
when
toby
tried
to
get
him
inside
the
posts
he
pulled
and
reefed
like
fury
and
bolted
altogether
and
came
flying
into
the
straight
a
dozen
lengths
to
the
good
of
course
losing
the
race
made
a
difference
of
a
note
to
toby
so
he
caught
the
horse
shoulder
with
his
spur
and
turned
him
upside
down
going
at
that
bat
then
to
keep
himself
out
of
a
row
he
gammoned
dead
till
we
poured
a
pint
of
beer
down
his
throat
and
he
lay
groaning
for
two
solid
hours
winking
now
and
then
at
nelson
and
me
but
that
just
tell
you
the
difference
neither
you
nor
i
would
be
game
to
do
a
thing
like
that
we
could
be
trained
to
it
simply
because
we
belong
to
a
superior
race
i
say
toby
for
the
had
seated
himself
near
pawsome
bench
and
was
there
enjoying
his
cockroach
off
you
go
like
a
good
chap
and
fetch
collins
horses
impidence
ai
worth
a
d
n
if
it

properly
carried
out
replied
the
inferior
creation
think
you
git
a
note
a
week
jist
for
your
adj
tucker

some
of

times
replied
moriarty
darkly
it

the
prince
the
divil
resave
ye

ind
to

said
moriarty
with
a
calmness
intended
to
seem
ominous
if
i
had
a
gun
in
my
hand
i
shoot
you
like
a
but
i
suppose
i
get
into
trouble
for
it
he
continued
scornfully
jist
the
same
for
layin
out
a
whitefeller
assented
the
prince
still
rasping
at
his
cockroach
like
ugolini
at
the
living
skull
of
ruggieri
in
dante
airy
conception
of
the
place
where
wrongs
are
rectified
that
unhappy
mannerism
again
you
see
permit
me
to
suggest
said
moriarty
after
a
pause
that
if
you
contemplated
your
own
origin
and
antecedents
it
would
assist
you
to
approximate
your
relative
position
on
this
station
do
you
think
a
trifle
of
subordination
would
be
appropriate
to
a
servile
and
halting
imitation
of
and
imitation
is
the
sincerest
flattery
i
commented
i
tell
miss
manners
please
appropriate
i
was
saying
to
a
blasted
varmin
like
you
permit
me
to
remind
you
that
montgomery
senior
gave
a
blanket
for
you
when
you
were
little
i
know
she
did
replied
the
prince
with
just
a
suspicion
of
nobody
would
be
fool
enough
to
give
a
blanket
for
you
when
you
was
little
soolim
come
on
moriarty
said
i
rising
i
must
take
a
bit
off
the
near
end
of
my
journey
howld
your
howlt
chaps
interposed
the
i
run
up
your
horses
for
you
i
was
takin
a
rise
out
mr
mori
adj
arty
esquire
jist
to
learn
him
not
to
be
quite
so
suddent
and
in
another
minute
he
was
striding
down
the
paddock
with
his
bridle
and
stockwhip
half
an
hour
later
my
horses
were
equipped
and
all
the
levites
being
absent
four
or
five
tribesmen
slowly
collected
under
pawsome
shed
waiting
to
see
what
would
happen
cleopatra
was
not
without
reputation
tell
you
what
you
better
do
said
moriarty
to
me
better
hang
your
socks
on
nosey
alf
crook
his
place
is
fifteen
mile
from
here
and
very
little
out
of
your
way
cranky
beggar
alf
is
been
on
the
pea
but
there
no
end
of
grass
in
his
paddock
and
i
say
get
him
to
give
you
a
tune
or
two
on
his
fiddle
something
splendid
i
believe
he
always
getting
music
by
post
from
sydney
montgomery
had
heard
him
sing
and
play
some
time
or
other
and
when
old
mooney
was
here
just
before
last
shearing
he
sent
toby
to
tell
alf
to
come
to
the
house
in
the
evening
and
bring
his
fiddle
and
alf
came
very
much
against
his
grain
young
mooney
was
asked
into
the
house
on
account
of
his
dad
being
there
and
he
swears
he
never
heard
anything
like
alf
style
though
the
stubborn
devil
would
sing
a
word
nothing
but
play
and
he
was
just
as
good
on
the
piano
as
on
the
fiddle
though
his
hand
must
have
been
badly
out
mooney
thinks
he
jibbed
on
singing
because
the
women
were
there
alf
a
it
i
suggested
mis
mis
mysterious
character
no
mis
mis
try
a
synonym
is
that
it
i
think
it
is
well
alf
a
misasynonym
womanhater
among
other
things
when
he
comes
to
the
station
he
dodges
the
women
like
a
criminal
and
the
unsociable
dog
begged
of
montgomery
not
to
ask
him
to
perform
again
one
night
nelson
was
going
past
his
place
and
heard
a
concert
going
on
so
he
left
his
horse
and
sneaked
up
to
the
wall
but
the
music
suddenly
stopped
and
before
nelson
knew
nosey
dog
had
the
seat
out
of
his
pants
nosey
came
out
and
apologised
for
the
dog
and
brought
nelson
in
to
have
some
supper
and
nelson
stayed
till
about
twelve
but
devil
a
squeak
of
the
fiddle
or
a
line
of
a
song
could
he
get
out
of
alf
but
as
the
boss
says
alf
only
mad
enough
to
know
the
difference
between
an
and

began
drawing

on

with

moriarty
i
interrupted
do
you
see
that

reversing

a

to

there

do

a

which
is

again
interrupted
you
at

now
do
you
see

and
did
you
ever

i

you
seen
some
changes
on

station
jack
well
i
must
be
going
leaving
the
old
fellow
talking
i
threw
the
reins
over
cleopatra
head
and
drew
the
near
one
a
little
the
tightest
he
stood
motionless
as
a
statue
and
beautiful
as
a
poet
dream
would
think
that
horse
had
a
devil
in
him
as
big
as
a
bulldog
observed
the
shake
the
out
of
a
man
you
do
stick
to
him
and
yet
collins
ca
ride
worth
a
cuss
contributed
moriarty
confidentially
he
just
dropped
to
this
fellow
style
boss
wanted
to
see
him
on
our
satan
but
collins
knew
a
thundering
sight
better
a
slight
lad
with
a
spur
trailing
at
his
right
heel
advanced
from
the
group
would
you
mind
lettin
me
take
the
off
o
this
feller
he
asked
modestly
if
he
slings
me
you
can
git
him
while
he
warm
an
no
harm
done
i
like
to
try
that
saddle
he
added
by
way
of
excuse
minds
me
o
one
i
got
shook
five
months
ago
with
a
redheaded
galoot
i
bin
treatin
like
a
brother
on
account
of
him
bein
an
the
both
of
us
travellin
the
same
road
best
shape
saddle
i
ever
had
a
leg
over
that
was
will
i
have
a
try
not
worth
while
jack
i
replied
he
might
prop
a
little
certainly
but
it
only
playfulness
so
i
swung
into
the
deep
seat
of
the
stolen
saddle
and
lightly
touched
the
memphian
with
both
spurs
first
a
reeling
dancing
uncertain
panorama
of
buildings
fences
and
spectators
then
a
mechanical
response
to
the
surging
jerking
concussive
saddle
and
a
guarded
strain
on
the
dragging
reins
also
a
tranquil
cognisance
of
favourable
comment
exchanged
by
competent
judges
no
excitement
no
admiration
remember
not
a
trace
of
interest
but
a
certain
dignified
and
judicious
approbation
honourable
alike
to
critic
and
artist
fools
admire
but
men
of
wit
approve
you
see
it
only
playfulness
i
remarked
indifferently
the
words
being
punctuated
by
necessity
rather
than
by
choice
magnificent
but
not
war
there
not
of
vice
in
his
as
the
poet
says
this
is
mere
madness
and
thus
awhile
the
fit
will
work
on
him
anon
as
patient
as
the
female
dove
when
that
her
golden
couplets
have
dis
closed
his
silence
will
sit
drooping
there
you
are
and
cleopatra
stood
still
slightly
panting
it
is
true
but
with
guilelessness
in
his
madonna
face
then
as
the
toilers
of
the
station
slowly
dispersed
to
see
about
getting
up
an
appetite
for
supper
moriarty
advanced
and
laid
both
hands
on
cleopatra
mane
collins
he
exclaimed
i
better
pleased
than
if
i
had
won
ten
bob
what
do
you
think
that
verse
you
quoted
from
shakespear
brought
the
question
to
my
mind
like
a
shot
of
a
gun
the
very
question
i
wanted
to
ask
you
a
couple
of
hours
ago
i
know
it
been
asked
before
in
fact
i
met
with
it
in
an
english
magazine
where
the
writer
uses
the
very
words
you
quoted
just
now
i
thought
perhaps
you
had
never
met
with
the
question
and
it
might
interest
you
was
hamlet
mad
of
some
few
amiable
qualities
with
which
it
has
pleased
heaven
to
endow
me
beyond
the
majority
of
my
fellows
a
is
by
no
means
the
least
in
importance
i
looked
down
in
the
ingenuous
face
of
the
searcher
after
wisdom
quenching
like
malvolio
my
familiar
smile
with
an
austere
regard
of
control
semper
felix
i
observed
hopelessly
you
right
in
saying
that
the
question
has
been
asked
before
it
has
been
asked
but
daylight
in
the
morning
is
the
right
time
to
enter
on
that
inquiry
for
the
present
we
must
leave
the
prince
to
rest
in
his
ancestral
vault
where
he
was
laid
by
the
pious
hands
of
horatio
and
fortinbras
where
each
in
his
narrow
cell
for
ever
laid
the
rude
forefathers
of
the
hamlet
sleep
quotation
ai
it
suggested
moriarty
critically
no
i
sighed
well
then
i
beggared
if
i
can
see
anything
in
that
sort
of
an
answer
remarked
the
young
fellow
resentfully
dear
boy
i
replied
i
never
imagined
that
you
could
i
would
you
had
but
the
wit
better
than
your
dukedom
is
other
name
which
jack
old
jack
or
young
jack
or
jack
the
shellback
or
jack
young
jack
the
chap
that
offered
to
ride
cleopatra
jack
frost
right
and
remember
our
arrangement
ole
man
depend
your
life
on
my
straightness
then
i
whistled
to
pup
noticed
that
bunyip
had
got
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
fence
and
turned
cleopatra
head
toward
the
bogan
james
rightly
remarks
that
nothing
is
more
promotive
of
thought
than
the
walking
pace
of
a
horse
we
may
add
that
nothing
on
earth
can
soothe
and
purify
like
the
canter
nothing
strengthen
and
exhilarate
like
the
gallop
the
trot
is
passed
over
with
such
contempt
as
it
deserves
so
for
the
first
mile
i
was
soothed
and
purified
for
the
next
i
busied
myself
on
a
metaphysical
problem
and
so
on
for
about
five
miles
the
metaphysical
difficulty
if
you
care
about
knowing
arose
in
connection
with
the
singular
issue
of
that
preposterous
wager
whence
came
such
an
elaborate
dispensation
if
from
above
it
was
plainly
addressed
to
moriarty
as
a
salutary
check
on
his
growing
propensity
if
from
beneath
it
must
have
been
a
last
desperate
attempt
to
decoy
into
evil
ways
one
who
was
perhaps
better
worth
enlisting
than
the
average
to
which
of
these
sources
would
you
trace
the
movement
mind
you
our
grandfathers
to
come
no
closer
would
have
piously
taken
the
event
on
its
face
value
of
as
a
blessing
to
the
prodistan
and
a
chastisement
to
the
papish
but
we
move
and
by
my
faith
we
have
need
presently
i
entered
on
the
narrow
and
now
carrying
a
line
of
fence
on
my
right
shoulder
i
followed
the
pleasant
track
winding
through
pine
wilga
quondong
and
so
forth
two
miles
of
this
then
on
my
right
appeared
the
white
gate
through
which
ran
the
nalrooka
track
up
to
this
time
i
had
been
following
the
route
which
a
harsh
usage
of
the
country
had
interdicted
to
priestley
montgomery
and
folkestone
returning
from
their
drive
had
just
come
through
this
gate
the
buggy
turned
toward
home
was
on
the
track
in
front
of
me
and
montgomery
was
resuming
his
seat
after
shutting
the
gate
the
station
loosely
tied
was
lying
on
the
i
had
just
done
explaining
where
i
was
bound
for
and
on
what
business
and
where
i
intended
staying
that
night
when
i
nearly
tumbled
off
my
horse
with
a
sort
of
white
horror
for
straight
behind
the
buggy
and
less
than
eighty
yards
away
team
came
crawling
along
the
fence
with
the
evident
purpose
of
catching
the
nalrooka
track
at
the
gate
priestley
had
chanced
it
knowing
every
gate
on
the
run
he
had
merely
gone
round
the
and
had
already
made
a
stage
in
ten
miles
travelling
that
is
losing
three
miles
in
the
detour
once
through
this
gate
the
track
would
be
lovely
the
wagon
would
chase
the
bullocks
evening
would
soon
be
on
he
would
fetch
feed
and
water
at
the
tank
in
the
quiet
moonlight
moreover
if
he
met
a
boundary
man
he
could
easily
say
he
had
permission
from
the
boss
in
any
case
it
would
soon
be
not
worth
while
to
order
him
back
and
he
would
be
off
the
run
some
time
forenoon
i
could
read
his
thoughts
as
i
looked
at
him
across
montgomery
shoulder
concealed
from
distant
observation
by
the
timber
of
the
he
had
dismissed
all
apprehension
and
allowed
his
mind
to
drift
to
a
bend
of
the
murrumbidgee
a
couple
of
miles
above
hay
there
were
his
young
barbarians
all
at
play
there
was
their
dacent
mother
he
their
sire
looking
blissfully
forward
to
superhuman
work
and
plenty
of
it
straight
into
the
lion
mouth
heaven
help
but
does
heaven
help
the
i
question
it
half
an
hour
loafing
at
any
time
during
the
day
would
have
timed
his
arrival
so
as
not
only
to
obviate
the
present
danger
but
to
spare
him
the
disquieting
consciousness
of
narrow
escape
and
heaven
helps
those
who
help
themselves
he
knew
the
gate
was
near
and
with
the
automatic
restlessness
of
an
impatient
dog
tied
under
a
travelling
dray
he
walked
back
and
forward
backward
and
forward
beside
his
weary
team
often
looking
back
to
see
the
wagon
clear
the
trees
but
never
by
any
chance
looking
forward
against
the
blaze
of
the
declining
sun
intently
enough
to
notice
the
back
of
the
buggy
partly
concealed
as
it
was
by
an
umbrageous
wilga
as
i
watched
him
i
wished
with
balaam
that
there
were
a
sword
in
mine
hand
that
i
might
slay
the
ass
i
dare
ride
past
the
buggy
for
fear
of
montgomery
looking
round
to
say
something
i
him
tell
me
that
the
sydney
crew
had
won
the
regatta
and
that
jupiter
was
starting
a
hot
favourite
for
the
flemington
and
all
this
time
the
unconscious
son
of
perdition
was
crawling
nearer
not
a
jolt
nor
a
came
from
his
wagon
as
it
pressed
the
yielding
soil
and
the
faint
creaking
of
the
tackle
was
drowned
in
the
rustle
of
a
hot
wind
through
the
foliage
i
sorry
to
see
you
starting
so
late
in
the
day
and
saturday
too
continued
the
squatter
courteously
the
barracks
will
be
lively
over
these
sporting
events
i
bowed
i
would
have
licked
the
dust
to
see
him
stand
not
upon
the
order
of
his
going
but
go
at
once
well
i
must
be
moving
i
mumbled
hastily
glancing
behind
me
at
the
sun
and
backing
cleopatra
into
the
scrub
to
let
the
buggy
pass
noting
also
that
priestley
was
forty
yards
away
now
confess
the
truth
collins
you
been
having
a
tiff
with
mrs
beaudesart
continued
montgomery
lovers
quarrel
that
nothing
i
did
think
you
were
so
pettish
as
to
run
away
like
this
indeed
montgomery
said
i
earnestly
i
assure
you
i
only
going
at
the
call
of
duty
i
show
here
it
struck
me
that
the
production
of
my
letter
would
delay
things
worse
and
by
the
way
there
a
parcel
for
alf
jones
in
the
continued
the
squatter
with
hideous
dilatoriness
i
see
it
a
roll
of
music
better
take
it
and
his
newspaper
get
him
to
give
you
a
tune
on
his
violin
if
you
can
it
will
be
something
to
remember
thank
you
for
the
suggestion
sir
i
continued
slavishly
whilst
backing
cleopatra
a
little
further
into
the
scrub
and
clearing
my
throat
with
a
sharp
pentrating
sound
as
if
i
had
swallowed
a
fly
just
then
the
bullocks
stopped
of
their
own
accord
within
ten
yards
of
the
buggy
and
priestley
in
laying
out
fresh
work
for
himself
was
roused
by
my
loud
and
took
in
the
situation
montgomery
seemed
amused
at
my
tribulation
why
your
manner
betrays
you
collins
never
mind
you
grow
out
of
that
in
good
time
when
is
it
coming
off
he
crossed
his
knees
and
held
the
reins
jammed
between
them
whilst
deliberately
filling
and
lighting
his
pipe
meanwhile
priestley
in
silent
communion
with
his
maker
stood
by
his
team
as
if
waiting
to
be
photographed
the
buggy
was
in
a
cool
pleasant
shade
and
montgomery
would
maintain
this
flagitious
procrastination
of
his
managerial
duties
while
i
remained
a
butt
for
his
chaff
critical
is
no
name
for
the
state
of
affairs
but
an
angel
seemed
to
whisper
me
soul
to
soul
i
responded
to
the
inspiration
well
i
show
you
the
letter
montgomery
said
i
with
a
petulance
tempered
by
sycophancy
i
first
felt
then
slapped
my
pockets
by
japers
i
left
my
on
the
seat
in
front
of
the
barracks
i
continued
hurriedly
as
i
turned
cleopatra
back
toward
the
station
and
bounded
off
at
a
canter
i
had
gone
five
strides
when
flick
went
the
the
vehicle
started
after
me
and
priestley
was
saved
but
there
is
no
such
thing
as
permanent
safety
in
this
world
the
first
rattle
of
the
wheels
was
followed
by
a
loud
pompous
cough
from
one
of
the
bullocks
hullo
what
the
sheol
have
we
here
it
was
montgomery
voice
no
longer
jocular
i
turned
and
rode
back
as
he
swung
his
buggy
round
on
the
lock
skilfully
threading
the
trees
and
scrub
till
he
resumed
his
old
position
but
now
facing
the
bullock
team
and
what
in
the
devil
name
brings
you
round
this
quarter
he
demanded
sternly
this
is
a
bad
job
you
right
magomery
assented
the
bullock
driver
with
emphasis
it
is
a
bad
job
it
a
adj
bad
job
way
it
comes
you
see
i
got
a
bit
o
loadin
for
nalrookar
i
know
all
about
that
though
i
not
interested
in
the
transaction
retorted
montgomery
i
asked
you
what
the
sheol
brings
you
here
well
that
just
what
i
was
goin
to
explain
when
you
took
the
word
out
o
my
mouth
you
see
magomery
the
proper
road
for
me
would
been
back
along
the
main
track
to
the
swamp
an
from
there
along
the
nalrookar
track
but
i
was
frightened
o
the
convincer
so
i
thought
i
just
cut
across
great
god
you
thought
you
just
cut
across
do
you
own
this
run
well
no
magomery
i
do
that
adj
certain
but
if
i
thought
you
any
objection
i
ast
leaf
that
what
you
should
have
done
you
acted
like
a
d
d
fool
you
give
me
leaf
suggested
the
bullock
driver
in
a
tone
full
of
unspoken
entreaty
i
have
seen
you
in
sheol
first
i
decline
to
make
a
thoroughfare
of
the
run
but
by
condescending
to
ask
me
you
have
saved
yourself
some
travelling
the
nearest
way
to
the
main
road
is
past
the
station
here
rouse
up
your
d
d
mongrels
and
make
a
start
along
this
track
i
see
that
you
escorted
if
you
before
you
reach
the
main
road
i
shall
certainly
prosecute
you
once
there
i
take
care
you
trespass
again
during
this
trip
come
move
yourself
priestley
had
never
been
taught
to
order
himself
lowly
and
reverently
to
all
his
betters
yet
there
was
deeper
pathos
in
the
rude
dignity
of
his
reply
than
could
have
attended
servility
it
s
this
way
magomery
i
do
deny
i
got
here
in
a
sneakin
way
i
feel
it
magomery
by
sheol
i
do
still
i
here
now
well
if
i
tackle
this
track
out
to
the
main
road
there
three
o
them
drop
in
yoke
before
i
fetch
the
station
would
you
like
to
see
the
bones
layin
aside
this
track
every
time
you
drive
past
i
bet
you
what
you
like
you
be
sorry
when
your
temper
is
over
then
we
say
i
out
on
the
main
road
how
i
goin
to
fetch
nalrooka
not
possible
the
way
i
fixed
i
would
do
it
to
you
mr
magomery
i
had
ridden
to
the
side
of
the
buggy
montgomery
said
i
i
wish
to
heaven
that
you
were
under
of
the
obligation
to
me
that
i
am
under
to
you
so
that
i
might
venture
to
speak
in
this
case
but
the
remembrance
of
so
much
consideration
at
your
hands
m
the
past
encourages
me
there
a
great
deal
in
what
priestley
says
my
own
experience
in
bullock
driving
brings
it
home
to
me
and
i
sympathise
with
him
rather
than
with
you
of
course
the
matter
rests
entirely
in
your
hands
but
to
me
it
appears
in
the
light
of
a
responsibility
it
is
noble
to
have
a
squatter
strength
but
tyrannous
to
use
it
like
a
squatter
something
like
a
smile
struggled
to
montgomery
sunburnt
face
and
i
could
see
that
the
battle
was
over
but
another
was
impending
it
was
now
since
i
had
met
the
buggy
folkestone
had
calmly
ignored
me
from
the
first
when
the
trouble
supervened
his
haughty
immobility
had
still
sustained
him
at
such
an
altitude
as
to
render
priestley
as
well
as
myself
invisible
even
to
bird
eye
view
but
the
small
soul
rattling
about
loose
in
the
large
body
could
let
it
pass
at
that
on
my
interposing
he
placed
a
glass
in
his
eye
and
with
a
degress
of
rudeness
which
i
have
never
seen
equalled
in
a
navvies
camp
stared
straight
in
my
face
till
i
had
done
speaking
then
the
lens
dropped
from
his
eye
and
he
turned
to
his
companion
who
is
this
person
montgomery
he
asked
the
squatter
looked
plainly
displeased
he
was
as
proud
as
his
guest
but
in
a
different
way
folkestone
being
a
gentleman
per
se
was
distinguished
from
the
ordinary
image
of
god
by
caste
and
culture
and
to
these
he
added
a
fatal
do
take
me
as
saying
that
caste
and
culture
could
possibly
have
made
him
a
boor
take
me
as
saying
that
these
had
been
powerless
to
avert
the
misfortune
he
was
a
gentleman
by
the
grace
of
god
and
the
flunkeyism
of
man
montgomery
was
also
a
gentleman
but
only
by
virtue
of
his
position
so
that
for
instance
priestley
personal
appearing
as
a
squatter
would
have
been
received
on
equal
terms
by
montgomery
whereas
disdain
would
have
been
scarcely
lessened
the
relative
manliness
of
the
two
types
of
is
a
question
which
each
student
will
judge
according
to
his
own
fallen
nature
pardon
me
for
saying
that
you
australians
have
queer
ways
of
maintaining
authority
continued
the
european
lazily
raising
his
eyebrows
and
speaking
with
the
accent
or
rather
absence
of
accent
which
in
an
englishman
denotes
education
a
vagrant
by
appearance
and
probably
not
overburdened
with
honesty
is
found
trespassing
on
your
property
then
this
individual
by
gad
i
feel
curious
to
know
who
our
learned
brother
for
the
defence
is
bandies
words
with
you
on
the
other
fellow
behalf
i
confess
i
rather
like
his
style
i
expected
to
hear
him
address
you
as
boy
or
dear
fellow
or
by
some
such
affectionate
title
pardon
my
warmth
i
say
montgomery
but
this
phase
of
colonial
life
is
new
to
me
placed
in
your
position
if
my
opinion
as
a
landlord
be
worth
anything
i
should
make
an
example
of
the
trespassing
scoundrel
partly
as
a
tonic
to
himself
and
partly
as
a
lesson
to
this
cad
if
i
rightly
understand
you
have
the
power
to
punish
by
fine
or
imprisonment
any
trespass
on
your
you
do
exercise
your
prerogative
you
say
by
gad
you
have
to
exercise
it
or
let
me
assure
you
you
will
be
sowing
thorns
for
your
children
to
reap
here
i
should
imagine
is
an
excellent
opportunity
for
vindication
of
your
rights
as
a
land
owner
this
reasoning
would
have
affected
montgomery
foregone
decision
to
suspend
his
own
rights
in
the
current
case
had
not
priestley
been
too
industrious
to
notice
the
opening
avenue
of
escape
but
to
the
bullock
driver
troubled
mind
it
appeared
that
he
had
managed
to
wander
inside
the
wings
of
the
stockyard
of
fate
and
that
folkestone
was
lending
a
willing
hand
to
hurroo
him
into
the
crush
moreover
the
rough
magnanimity
of
the
man
nature
was
outraged
by
some
supposed
insult
sustained
by
me
on
his
behalf
just
three
words
of
comment
here
built
into
the
moral
structure
of
each
earthly
probationer
is
a
thermometer
graduated
independently
and
it
is
never
safe
to
heat
the
individual
to
the
of
his
register
you
never
know
how
far
up
the
scale
this
point
is
unless
you
are
very
familiar
with
the
particular
thermometer
under
experiment
romeo
for
instance
pacific
by
nature
and
to
forbearance
by
the
of
inspirations
meets
deadly
public
insult
by
the
softest
of
answers
dishonourable
vile
submission
his
friend
calls
it
but
the
slaying
of
that
friend
touches
then
to
heaven
respective
lenity
and
fury
be
my
conduct
now
whereupon
tybalt
the
tamperer
is
scalded
to
death
in
ida
as
we
have
seen
the
insinuated
aspersion
of
unchastity
touched
and
the
experimentalist
was
glad
to
retreat
with
damaged
dignity
from
the
escaping
steam
so
in
priestley
the
wanton
hostility
of
folkestone
touched
and
the
billy
boiled
over
wasting
the
water
and
smothering
the
owner
with
ashes
one
moment
more
please
nations
kindreds
and
peoples
are
individuals
in
mass
and
here
the
existence
of
an
overlooked
is
the
one
thing
that
makes
history
interesting
cowper
puts
on
paper
a
fine
breezy
english
contempt
for
the
submissiveness
and
of
the
french
and
lives
to
wonder
at
the
course
of
events
macaulay
diction
rolls
like
the
swelling
of
jordan
as
he
expatiates
on
the
absolute
subserviency
the
settled
incapacity
for
resistance
of
the
bengalee
till
presently
the
mutiny
a
near
thing
in
two
widely
different
senses
and
confined
to
the
bengalee
troops
shakes
his
credit
so
it
has
ever
been
and
ever
shall
be
but
for
that
ingrained
endowment
of
resilience
man
would
long
ago
have
ceased
to
inhabit
this
planet
when
priestley
came
to
the
boil
all
considerations
of
expediency
all
natural
love
of
peace
and
fear
of
the
wrath
to
come
all
solicitude
for
wife
and
children
vanished
from
his
mind
leaving
him
fit
for
treasons
stratagems
and
spoils
i
must
suppress
about
half
the
language
in
which
he
clothed
his
one
remaining
thought
an
who
are
you
he
thundered
advancing
toward
the
buggy
a
loafer
no
better
an
you
must
shove
in
your
lip
i
do
blame
magomery
for
bein
nasty
he
got
a
right
to
blaggard
me
the
way
things
is
an
i
give
him
credit
but
you
if
i
had
you
a
couple
o
hundred
mile
furder
back
i
learn
you
manners
i
make
you
spring
off
o
your
tail
folkestone
his
head
canted
to
a
listening
angle
noted
with
a
smile
the
outlaw
tirade
then
he
rose
drew
off
his
light
coat
and
laid
it
across
the
back
of
the
buggy
seat
i
will
thump
this
fellow
montgomery
said
he
and
he
certainly
meant
it
priestley
was
a
man
of
nine
stone
by
your
favour
once
more
and
only
once
the
englishman
proper
is
the
pugilist
of
the
world
the
australian
or
american
maxima
may
be
as
brutal
or
even
more
so
but
the
average
efficiency
in
smiting
with
the
fist
of
wickedness
is
beyond
all
question
on
the
english
side
fair
play
is
a
fine
expression
it
justifies
the
bashing
of
the
puny
drapers
assistant
by
the
big
hairy
blacksmith
and
this
to
the
perfect
satisfaction
of
both
parties
if
they
are
worthy
the
name
of
englishmen
also
the
english
gentleman
may
take
off
his
coat
to
the
potsherd
of
the
earth
and
so
excellent
is
his
discrimination
that
the
combat
will
surely
end
even
as
your
novelist
describes
simply
because
no
worshipper
can
make
headway
against
his
god
when
the
divinity
hits
back
at
the
same
time
no
insubordinate
englishman
named
yorkey
and
made
in
proportion
ever
did
or
ever
will
suffer
manual
mauling
at
the
hands
of
an
english
gentleman
or
any
other
gentleman
for
that
matter
what
a
fool
the
gentleman
would
be
no
yorkey
is
always
given
in
charge
and
it
takes
three
policemen
to
run
him
in
english
varnhagen
von
ense
tells
us
how
continental
gentlemen
envied
the
social
usage
which
permitted
lord
castlereagh
in
to
show
off
his
bruising
ability
at
the
expense
of
a
viennese
cabman
probably
some
consumptive
and
certainly
a
man
who
had
never
seen
a
in
his
life
but
english
does
stand
transplantation
to
australia
except
in
patches
of
suitable
soil
for
instance
when
meets
pimp
at
a
side
then
comes
the
business
the
man
though
saturnine
is
very
rarely
quarrelsome
and
almost
never
a
pugilist
nevertheless
his
foot
on
his
native
it
is
not
advisable
to
assault
him
with
any
feebler
weapon
than
there
is
a
radical
difference
without
a
verbal
distinction
between
his
and
the
englishman
notions
of
each
is
willing
to
content
himself
with
the
weapons
provided
by
nature
but
the
southern
barbarian
prefers
a
natural
product
about
three
feet
long
and
the
thickness
of
your
wrist
at
the
butt
his
conception
of
being
qualified
by
a
fixed
resolution
to
prove
himself
the
better
counterfeit
so
priestley
with
a
sinister
glitter
in
his
patient
eyes
had
reversed
his
whipstick
pliant
end
downward
and
bent
along
the
ground
he
knew
the
nature
of
seasoned
pine
a
sharp
jerk
and
the
whipstick
would
snap
supplying
a
which
would
make
him
an
for
a
dozen
folkestones
in
rotation
my
hand
was
on
cleopatra
mane
and
my
clear
of
the
stirrup
it
would
be
a
christian
act
to
save
foikestone
from
the
father
of
a
batin
and
priestley
from
that
sterner
father
namely
old
father
antic
the
law
but
imminent
as
the
collision
seemed
it
did
sit
down
folkestone
said
montgomery
holding
his
companion
sleeve
with
a
firm
grip
whilst
gazing
steadily
northward
through
the
narrow
fringe
of
timber
following
his
eye
i
saw
a
horseman
a
mile
and
a
half
distant
heading
for
the
homestead
at
a
walk
is
that
arblaster
collins
demanded
the
squatter
i
brought
my
binocular
to
bear
on
the
horseman
nelson
i
replied
better
still
signal
him
i
galloped
out
into
the
plain
wheeled
broadside
on
and
waved
my
hat
the
equestrian
profile
changed
to
a
narrow
line
and
i
returned
to
the
buggy
followed
at
a
decent
interval
by
nelson
i
was
glad
to
see
priestley
in
the
act
of
driving
through
the
gate
come
here
priestley
said
montgomery
quietly
you
have
my
permission
to
follow
this
track
to
the
nalrooka
boundary
i
hope
i
git
some
slant
to
do
as
much
silence
but
if
you
trespass
on
my
feed
or
water
by
god
i
prosecute
you
another
thing
never
in
future
load
anything
for
me
or
come
to
this
station
expecting
wool
and
i
may
as
well
warn
you
that
every
boundary
man
in
my
employ
will
be
on
the
for
you
from
this
time
forward
nelson
you
ride
behind
his
wagon
to
the
boundary
and
see
that
he
keeps
the
track
a
frown
gathered
on
the
young
fellow
face
reinforced
by
a
burning
blush
as
montgomery
went
on
perhaps
you
scarcely
expected
me
to
concur
in
your
opinion
that
one
ought
to
spring
a
bit
in
a
season
like
this
yet
i
have
no
intention
of
crushing
a
poor

more
to

without

i
have
already
given
him
a
thorough
good
blackguarding
for
calculating
upon
crossing
the

if
he
trespasses
on

or

if
he
does
go
straight
on

you

i
may
quarrel
who

ah
who

the
ubiquitous

i
abjectly
are
you

asked
with
a
glance
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
i
find
i
got
it
here
all
the

wonder
how
i
came
to

too
much
about

i
raised
my
wideawake
to
folkestone
who
again
placed
his
glass
in
his
eye
and
stared
at
me
wonderingly
till
we
tore
ourselves
apart
another
mile
and
i
cleared
the
looking
back
to
the
right
i
could
see
priestley
and
his
guard
of
honour
crawling
toward
the
which
lay
two
miles
from
the
gate
where
we
had
parted
they
would
reach
the
tank
as
twilight
merged
into
moonlight
then
nelson
would
say
going
to
have
a
drink
of
tea
at
jack

i
be
back
in

or
four
hours

you
not

of

that

in
the
hollow

kindle
a
fire
unless
you
want
to
get
lagged
and
priestley
would
get
to
the
boundary
by
ten
on
the
morrow
without
the
loss
of
a
beast
thanking
heaven
that
he
had
been
escorted
by
arblaster
or
butler
and
racking
his
invention
to
provide
for
the
coming
night
also
montgomery
would
within
a
week
know
all
the
details
of
the
trip
again
but
being
a
white
man
he
would
silently
condone
nelson
disobedience
one
more
little
incident
enlivened
the
monotony
of
my
journey
to
alf
hut
whilst
giving
my
horses
a
walk
i
took
out
the
newspaper
toby
had
brought
i
did
look
for
any
marginal
marks
having
recognised
jeff
rigby
handwriting
in
the
address
rigby
is
a
man
who
never
writes
except
on
his
own
account
his
way
of
acknowledging
a
letter
is
to
pick
up
a
newspaper
of
perhaps
a
month
old
tie
a
string
round
it
stamp
and
address
it
and
drop
it
in
the
nearest
this
paper
however
happened
to
be
the
latest
available
issue
of
a
melbourne
daily
and
contained
a
copious
account
of
the
regatta
followed
by
the
portrait
of
a
young
man
with
the
neck
and
shoulders
and
by
one
of
nature
sad
yet
just
compensations
also
the
face
and
head
of
the
average
athlete
rude
as
the
engraving
was
the
subject
of
it
at
once
suggested
what
the
canvassers
call
an
risk
and
underneath
ran
the
title
rudolph
winterbottom
stroke
of
the
winning
crew
an
ensuing
paragraph
briefly
sketched
the
hero
history
habits
and
physical
excellencies
he
was
years
of
age
had
a
good
position
in
the
civil
service
and
was
now
on
leave
of
absence
he
was
a
a
and
in
a
word
was
distinguished
in
almost
every
branch
of
those
gambol
faculties
which
show
a
weak
mind
and
an
able
body
it
gave
me
quite
a
turn
sic
transit
thought
i
with
a
sigh
such
is
life
the
cranky
boundary
rider
little
weatherboard
hut
standing
just
inside
his
fence
was
neater
than
the
average
the
moonlight
showed
that
a
radius
of
five
or
six
yards
from
the
door
had
been
swept
with
a
broom
while
some
containing
occupied
the
angle
formed
by
the
chimney
and
the
wall
the
galvanised
bucket
and
basin
on
the
bench
by
the
door
were
conspicuously
clean
and
the
showed
through
a
green
blind
on
the
window
a
collie
gave
a
few
perfunctory
barks
as
i
drew
near
whereupon
alf
with
sleeves
rolled
up
and
hands
freshly
blooded
to
the
wrists
appeared
at
the
door
and
drew
back
on
seeing
me
i
brought
my
horses
through
the
gate
and
he
met
me
outside
the
hut
his
hands
washed
and
his
buttoned
he
stood
by
scarcely
speaking
whilst
i
introduced
myself
gave
him
his
parcel
and
newspaper
and
unsaddled
my
horses
then
i
followed
him
into
the
hut
and
he
cleared
away
from
the
table
the
anatomy
of
a
fine
turkey
shot
during
the
day
sullenly
he
replenished
the
kettle
and
put
the
fire
together
then
washed
the
table
and
laid
it
for
one
but
the
newspaper
revelation
in
giving
me
a
turn
had
turned
me
and
i
cared
little
for
alf
sullenness
provided
he
listened
with
attention
to
my
discourse
on
the
mutability
of
things
by
the
time
he
had
poured
out
my
tea
he
was
a
vanquished
man
he
filled
a
cup
for
himself
to
keep
me
company
and
guardedly
commented
on
the
news
i
brought
from
the
station
and
the
gate
still
i
was
touched
to
observe
that
he
kept
his
disfigured
face
averted
as
much
as
possible
did
you
ever
reflect
upon
how
much
you
have
to
be
thankful
for
in
the
matter
of
noses
your
nose
in
all
probability
is
your
dram
of
eale
your
club
foot
your
mordecai
sitting
at
the
king
gate
but
you
would
look
very
queer
without
it
in
your
morbid
hypercriticalness
you
may
wish
this
indocile
undisguisable
and
most
unsheltered
feature
had
been
made
a
little
longer
or
a
little
shorter
or
a
little
wider
or
not
quite
so
wide
or
perhaps
you
wish
the
isthmus
between
your
eyes
a
little
higher
or
the
ridge
of
the
peninsula
a
little
straighter
or
the
south
cape
a
little
more
or
less
obtuse
or
possibly
you
wish
that
the
front
elevation
elevation
is
good
did
not
admit
through
the
natural
grottoes
above
your
moustache
so
clear
a
perspective
of
the
interior
of
ambition
airy
hall
forcing
upon
you
the
conviction
that
your
own
early
disregard
of
your
repeated
admonitions
against
wiping
upward
had
come
home
to
you
at
last
and
had
come
to
stay
check
that
rebellious
spirit
i
charge
you
your
nose
is
good
enough
better
probably
than
you
deserve
be
thankful
that
you
have
one
of
any
design
at
all
this
poor
boundary
man
had
none
to
speak
of
and
it
seemed
such
a
pity
more
beautiful
otherwise
than
a
man
face
is
justified
in
being
it
was
apart
from
sex
as
if
pygmalion
masterpiece
had
fallen
heavily
face
downward
and
then
sprung
into
life
minus
the
feature
which
will
least
bear
tampering
with
the
upper
half
of
his
nose
was
represented
by
an
irregular
scar
running
off
toward
the
left
eye
which
was
dull
and
opaque
the
other
was
splendid
soft
and
luminous
and
as
he
sat
in
the
full
light
of
the
lamp
with
his
elbow
on
the
table
in
order
to
shade
with
his
hand
the
middle
part
of
his
face
the
combination
of
fine
frontal
development
with
exquisite
and
vigorous
contour
of
mouth
and
chin
was
so
striking
that
i
involuntarily
glanced
round
the
hut
for
the
his
lithe
graceful
movements
had
at
first
led
me
to
mark
him
down
as
a
mere
lad
but
now
the
showed
a
maze
of
incipient
wrinkles
on
the
sunburnt
neck
and
a
few
silver
threads
in
the
thick
strong
coalblack
hair
moreover
owing
to
inadvertence
or
ignorance
on
the
part
of
people
who
should
have
known
better
he
had
been
christened
in
immediate
succession
to
a
girl
it
is
well
and
widely
known
that
this
oversight
small
as
it
looks
will
free
a
man
for
life
from
any
rude
inquiry
as
to
when
he
is
going
to
burn
off
the
scrub
alf
had
no
scrub
to
burn
off
except
a
faint
moustache
unnoticeable
but
for
its
dark
colour
for
the
rest
he
was
slightly
above
medium
height
and
by
no
means
a
good
stamp
of
a
man
tapering
the
wrong
way
if
i
might
so
put
it
without
shocking
the
reader
and
from
stiff
serge
jumper
to
spur
he
alf
of
course
was
unbecomingly
clean
for
saturday
the
somewhat
wearisome
minuteness
of
this
description
is
owing
to
his
being
at
least
in
my
estimation
the
most
interesting
character
within
the
scope
of
these
scranny
memoirs
i
looked
round
for
the
it
was
a
bookcase
this
time
a
flat
nailed
to
the
wall
fitted
with
shelves
and
curtained
on
the
front
i
rose
and
inspected
the
collection
fifty
or
sixty
volumes
altogether
poetry
drama
popular
theology
reference
and
a
few
miscellaneous
works
history
meagrely
represented
science
and
fiction
not
at
all
you
do
find
many
people
of
my
name
in
the
country
remarked
the
boundary
man
trivially
after
a
pause
not
many
i
replied
wondering
whether
he
referred
to
his
nickname
or
to
the
inexpensive
but
lasting
gift
of
his
godfathers
and
godmothers
at
the
time
of
their
annoying
mistake
i
suppose
you
hardly
know
one
he
persisted
not
that
i
can
think
of
i
replied
have
you
any
yes
you
find
venne
lying
on
top
of
the
upper
shelf
i
read
it
years
ago
but
we
change
i
replied
when
i
first
got
my
it
was
by
hannah
more
now
it
by
zola
and
smutty
enough
at
that
it
has
undergone
about
twenty
intermediate
metamorphoses
and
it
still
going
remarkably
strong
in
both
senses
of
the
word
therefore
i
can
recommend
it
i
do
think
it
does
a
person
any
good
to
read
zola
remarked
the
boundary
man
gravely
not
the
slightest
alf
that
is
in
the
works
by
which
he
is
represented
amongst
us
but
do
you
think
it
does
a
person
any
good
to
read
holmes
zola
has
several
phases
one
of
them
i
admit
blue
as
heaven
own
tinct
but
holmes
has
only
one
phase
namely
pharisaism
zola
even
as
we
know
him
here
in
riverina
has
this
advantage
that
he
gives
you
no
rest
for
the
sole
of
your
foot
or
rather
for
the
foot
of
your
soul
whilst
holmes
serenely
seduces
you
to
his
own
pinchbeck
standard
zola
is
honest
he
never
calls
evil
good
whilst
holmes
is
spurious
all
through
mind
you
each
has
a
genuine
literary
merit
of
his
own
but
do
you
like
holmes
poetry
asked
alf
well
his
poems
fill
a
little
volume
that
the
world
would
be
sorry
to
lose
but
why
did
he
write
one
verse
just
one
for
the
abolitionists
to
quote
because
it
not
in
his
nature
to
denounce
things
objected
alf
neither
was
it
in
longfellow
nature
yet
longfellow
poems
on
slavery
are
judged
worthy
to
form
a
separate
section
of
his
works
but
holmes
can
denounce
most
valiantly
he
denounces
and
like
the
chivalrous
soul
that
he
is
he
has
achieved
the
distinction
of
being
the
only
american
poet
of
note
who
blandly
ignores
slavery
and
takes
part
with
the
aristocrat
as
against
the
lowly
the
same
spirit
runs
through
all
his
writings
he
has
a
range
of
about
three
notes
a
flunkeyish
to
eminence
a
tawdry
sympathy
with
aristocratic
woe
and
a
drivelling
contempt
for
angular
poor
relations
in
bombazine
gowns
bombazine
is
a
cheap
fabric
built
of
shoddy
and
generally
used
for
quilts
no
it
not
broke
in
alf
with
a
rippling
laugh
it
a
very
good
silk
one
way
and
wool
the
other
and
it
mostly
black
or
maroon
or
he
stopped
with
a
gasp
why
do
you
sit
down
he
continued
in
an
altered
tone
and
that
reminds
me
my
day
not
done
yet
he
cleared
the
table
and
placed
upon
it
his
turkey
in
a
i
had
the
conversation
to
myself
till
he
finished
his
work
and
took
the
turkey
outside
to
hang
it
on
the
this
was
a
sapling
of
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
high
with
a
fork
at
the
top
through
which
ran
a
piece
of
i
followed
him
to
the
door
discoursing
on
literature
whilst
he
attached
one
end
of
the
to
the
legs
hauled
it
up
to
the
fork
and
hitched
the
fall
of
the
rope
to
the
pole
but
just
as
the
turkey
reached
its
place
he
had
dropped
his
head
with
a
movement
of
pain
and
after
securing
the
rope
he
groped
his
way
into
the
hut
holding
his
hand
over
his
right
eye
bit
of
bark
or
something
dropped
nght
into
my
eye
he
muttered
it
does
suit
me
to
have
anything
wrong
with
the
one
i
have
left
by
the
bright
i
soon
relieved
him
of
what
proved
to
be
a
small
ant
then
he
went
out
to
the
and
i
heard
the
dabbling
of
water
i
got
a
in
my
eye
the
new
year
day
before
last
he
remarked
in
a
sort
of
sullen
after
we
had
sat
in
silence
for
a
minute
i
could
see
to
catch
a
horse
and
it
took
me
about
six
hours
to
grope
my
way
along
the
fences
to
dick
templeton
hut
i
thought
i
have
gone
mad
ah
said
i
sympathetically
that
reminds
me
of
an
incident
that
came
under
my
own
notice
on
the
very
day
you
speak
of
i
tell
you
how
it
happened
by
this
time
alf
had
lit
a
meek
and
lowly
meerschaum
whilst
a
large
grey
cat
had
jumped
on
his
knees
and
settled
itself
for
repose
you
asked
me
awhile
ago
whether
i
knew
anyone
of
your
name
in
this
part
of
the
country
i
forgot
at
the
moment
that
one
of
my
most
profitable
studies
is
a
namesake
of
yours
warrigal
alf
a
carrier
on
these
roads
what
his
other
name
asked
the
boundary
man
in
a
suppressed
voice
morris
why
do
you
call
him
so
then
i
hate
nicknames
poor
fellow
thought
i
and
i
continued
i
was
coming
down
from
cobar
with
a
single
horse
and
on
the
new
year
day
before
last
i
reached
the
yellow
tank
about
forty
miles
from
here
is
it
i
left
my
saddle
and
things
at
the
tank
and
was
taking
my
horse
out
to
a
place
where
there
always
a
bit
of
grass
when
i
noticed
a
wagon
in
the
scrub
and
identified
it
as
alf
did
you
know
him
before
murmured
the
boundary
man
certainly
is
he
a
married
man
widower
widower
repeated
alf
almost
in
a
whisper
did
you
know
his
wife
personally
no
inductively
yes
she
was
one
of
those
indefinably
dangerous
women
who
sing
men
to
destruction
one
of
those
tigresses
with
slumbrous
dark
eyes
name
iolanthe
what
iolanthe
de
vavasour
i
replied
more
appropriate
than
molly
is
it
the
boundary
man
after
picking
up
his
pipe
which
had
fallen
on
the
slumbering
cat
fixed
his
zitska
eye
on
my
face
with
a
puzzled
shrinking
defiant
look
whilst
drawing
his
seat
a
little
further
away
ah
years
of
solitary
life
with
the
haunting
consciousness
of
frightful
disfigurement
had
told
on
his
mind
moriarty
was
right
and
i
remembered
that
the
moon
was
approaching
the
full
alf
was
sitting
under
a
i
continued
with
his
hand
across
his
eyes
the
matter
alf
says
i
that
you
collins
says
he
trying
to
look
up
just
in
time
to
do
more
for
me
than
i
would
care
about
doing
for
you
i
met
with
an
accident
i
was
lying
on
my
back
under
the
wagon
this
morning
tightening
some
nuts
when
a
bit
of
rust
or
something
fell
straight
into
my
eye
frightful
pain
and
it
affecting
the
other
eye
already
giving
me
a
foretaste
of
hell
no
doubt
it
a
good
thing
but
i
do
want
a
monopoly
of
it
i
wish
i
could
pass
it
round
this
was
alf
style
of
philosophy
our
friend
iolanthe
is
largely
though
perhaps
indirectly
responsible
for
it
yes
go
on
said
the
boundary
man
nervously
well
as
i
was
telling
you
it
was
after
sunset
and
there
was
no
time
to
lose
so
i
whittled
a
bit
of
wood
to
a
point
and
essayed
the
task
in
which
i
claim
a
certain
eminence
namely
the
extraction
of
a
mote
from
my
brother
eye
right
alf
says
i
a
flake
of
rust
about
the
size
of
a
fish
scale
lodged
on
the
coloured
part
which
we
term
the
iris
or
strictly
speaking
on
that
part
of
the
cornea
which
covers
the
iris
but
i
ca
shift
it
with
this
appliance
must
get
something
sharper
so
i
took
a
pin
out
of
my
coat
and
grubbed
the
mote
as
well
as
i
could
by
the
deficient
light
i
do
know
what
alf
thought
of
it
at
the
time
but
i
considered
it
a
lovely
operation
when
it
was
over
alf
signified
to
me
that
i
was
wanted
any
longer
so
i
went
about
my
business
next
morning
as
i
was
going
toward
my
i
gave
my
patient
a
purely
professional
call
and
found
his
eye
worse
than
ever
i
subjected
him
to
another
examination
and
this
time
having
the
advantage
of
full
daylight
i
discovered
that
the
cause
of
his
trouble
was
a
flake
of
rust
after
all
but
a
small
barbed
speck
of
clean
iron
embedded
in
the
white
of
the
eye
i
discovered
something
else
alf
eyes
are
as
blue
as
those
of
zola
nana
and
in
the
iris
of
the
affected
one
there
is
or
rather
was
a
brown
spot
i
had
often
noticed
this
before
but
in
the
defective
light
and
the
hurry
of
the
operation
i
had
never
thought
of
the
thing
and
had
wasted
time
and
skill
on
it
as
i
tell
you
i
have
often
laughed
to
remember
you
were
badly
off
for
something
to
laugh
at
again
i
recalled
monarty
remark
for
the
boundary
man
voice
trembled
as
he
spoke
and
his
splendid
eye
blazed
with
sudden
resentment
but
the
fit
passed
away
instantly
and
he
asked
in
his
usual
subdued
tone
when
did
you
see
this
this
alf
morris
last
about
two
months
ago
i
replied
he
was
camped
at
that
time
in
the
dead
man
bend
at
the
junction
of
avondale
and
mondunbarra
when
are
you
likely
to
see
him
again
asked
the
boundary
man
but
of
course
you
ca
tell
it
a
foolish
question
i
do
know
what
come
over
me
ignorance
is
bliss
in
that
instance
poor
fellow
thought
i
glancing
out
at
the
weirdly
beautiful
moonlight
and
i
replied
most
likely
i
never
see
him
again
these
that
knew
him
so
well
will
know
him
no
more
again
for
ever
he
gone
to
a
warmer
climate
that
decides
it
muttered
the
lunatic
swaying
on
his
seat
whilst
he
clutched
the
edge
of
the
table
alf
alf
i
remonstrated
laying
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
shrank
from
the
touch
and
immediately
recovered
himself
let
me
explain
i
continued
soothingly
he
has
gone
four
or
five
months
journey
due
north
in
charge
of
three
teams
loaded
with
lares
and
penates
and
tools
and
cooking
utensils
and
rations
and
other
things
too
numerous
to
particularise
belonging
once
to
kooltopa
but
now
to
a
new
station
in
queensland
hence
i
say
he
gone
to
a
warmer
climate
not
much
of
a
joke
i
admit
and
what
what
become
of
kooltopa
asked
the
boundary
man
panting
under
his
effort
at
old
times
are
changed
old
manners
gone
a
stranger
fills
the
throne
i
replied
with
real
sadness
kooltopa
sold
to
a
melbourne
company
and
is
going
to
be
worked
for
all
it
worth
and
i
thinking
of
the
carrier
coming
down
with
the
survivors
of
a
severe
trip
and
the
penniless
pedestrian
striking
the
station
at
the
eleventh
hour
these
people
will
miss
stewart
badly
for
the
guest
flies
the
hall
and
the
vassal
from
labour
since
his
turban
was
cleft
by
the
infidel
sabre
whose
turban
asked
alf
with
a
puzzled
look
stewart
i
spake
but
by
a
metaphor
as
with
antony
is
one
of
those
odd
tricks
that
sorrow
shoots
out
of
the
mind
there
was
a
few
minutes
silence
i
was
thinking
of
the
christian
squatter
and
so
no
doubt
was
many
another
wanderer
at
the
same
moment
but
he
come
back
to
riverina
when
he
delivers
the
loading
suggested
the
boundary
man
who
this
alf
morris
i
do
think
so
i
know
he
does
intend
it
another
pause
glancing
at
my
companion
as
he
sat
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
one
hand
as
usual
across
the
middle
of
his
face
i
noticed
his
chest
heaving
unnaturally
and
his
shapely
lips
losing
their
deep
colour
are
you
sick
alf
yes
a
little
he
whispered
i
filled
a
cup
at
the
and
set
it
before
him
he
drank
part
of
it
quakers
meeting
he
remarked
at
length
with
a
slight
laugh
why
do
you
say
something
i
not
much
of
a
talker
myself
but
i
a
good
listener
tell
us
some
yarn
to
pass
the
time
anything
you
like
tell
us
all
about
that
camp
on
the
lachlan
and
what
passed
between
you
and
your
friend
morris
upon
this
hint
i
spake
i
recounted
consecutively
the
incidents
which
form
the
subject
of
an
earlier
chapter
whilst
an
occasional
inquiry
or
an
appreciative
nod
proved
my
eccentric
auditor
in
touch
with
me
from
first
to
last
three
or
four
weeks
afterward
i
continued
i
met
this
bob
stirling
in
mossgeil
he
had
a
bit
of
a
head
on
him
at
the
time
having
just
got
through
five
notes
three
from
stewart
and
two
from
alf
i
got
a
bob
worth
of
brandy
to
straighten
him
up
and
we
had
a
drink
of
tea
together
while
my
horses
went
through
a
small
feed
of
bad
chaff
at
sixpence
a
pound
his
account
was
that
stewart
after
parting
from
me
drove
straight
to
alf
camp
and
deposited
him
there
to
look
after
things
stewart
himself
only
stayed
a
few
minutes
and
then
drove
to
avondale
to
see
wentworth
john
ffrench
terrible
tommy
boss
next
morning
a
wagonette
came
from
avondale
with
a
few
parcels
of
eatables
and
a
few
bottles
of
drinkables
and
other
sinful
lusts
of
the
flesh
four
days
after
that
again
stewart
drove
round
on
his
way
back
to
kooltopa
by
this
time
alf
was
able
to
crawl
about
trying
his
best
to
be
civil
to
bob
and
succeeding
fairly
well
for
a
however
when
stewart
called
he
got
into
a
yarn
with
alf
and
had
a
drink
of
tea
while
bob
held
the
horses
presently
according
to
bob
account
the
conversation
grew
closer
and
after
an
hour
or
so
stewart
told
bob
to
unharness
the
horses
and
hobble
them
out
where
they
could
get
a
bite
of
grass
altogether
stewart
stayed
about
half
a
day
in
a
few
days
more
alf
was
able
to
yoke
and
unyoke
a
few
quiet
bullocks
then
he
and
bob
started
for
kooltopa
together
arrived
at
their
destination
stewart
and
alf
each
paid
bob
as
already
hinted
and
bob
having
urgent
business
in
mossgeil
hurried
away
to
transact
it
he
had
just
completed
the
deal
when
i
met
him
here
i
paused
to
light
my
pipe
and
what
makes
you
think
he
has
left
riverina
for
good
asked
the
boundary
man
absently
catch
him
leaving
riverina
he
knows
he
has
a
good
character
as
a
quiet
decent
innoffensive
sundowner
nobody
enemy
but
his
own
and
experience
has
taught
him
that
any
kind
of
tolerable
reputation
is
better
than
no
reputation
at
all
i
do
mean
him
said
the
boundary
man
constrainedly
of
course
not
i
beg
your
pardon
well
i
heard
it
from
himself
i
met
him
about
three
weeks
ago
that
would
be
about
three
weeks
after
my
interview
with
bob
stirling
he
fairly
in
love
with
what
he
saw
of
queensland
before
last
shearing
and
between
bad
seasons
and
selectors
not
to
mention
his
own
presentiment
of
a
he
of
riverina
but
that
reminds
me
that
i
have
brought
alf
morris
story
to
a
proper
conclusion
i
heard
the
rest
of
it
from
stewart
on
the
occasion
i
speak
of
stewart
has
bought
his
plant
and
engaged
him
permanently
his
first
business
is
to
take
stewart
teams
to
their
destination
no
easy
matter
at
this
time
of
the
year
and
such
a
year
as
this
but
if
any
man
can
do
it
that
man
is
alf
he
started
some
weeks
ago
a
little
shaky
after
his
sickness
but
recovering
fast
entirely
changed
in
disposition
stewart
tells
me
and
those
who
know
him
will
agree
that
a
change
would
be
out
of
place
but
stewart
speaks
of
him
as
one
of
the
men
he
ever
knew
he
says
he
just
wants
a
man
like
alf
and
he
does
intend
to
part
with
him
i
fancy
our
love
of
paradox
makes
us
prone
to
associate
with
cantankerousness
at
all
events
nobody
ever
called
me
but
such
is
life
then
this
new
situation
is
a
permanent
thing
for
him
suggested
the
boundary
man
for
alf
no
i
sorry
to
say
it
not
why
because
stewart
about
sixty
and
alf
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
would
give
stewart
an
actuarial
expectation
of
ten
or
fifteen
years
and
alf
one
of
or
thirty
and
there
will
be
changes
in
the
personnel
of
the
station
staff
when
the
grand
old
christian
sleeps
with
his
fathers
and
his
son
reigns
in
his
stead
such
again
is
life
but
this
wo
affect
interests
to
any
ruinous
extent
he
has
a
stockingful
of
his
own
it
a
fact
that
few
carriers
of
riverina
cleared
as
much
money
as
he
did
and
probably
not
one
spent
less
stewart
gave
him
for
his
plant
and
he
never
broke
the
cheque
posted
it
whole
stewart
himself
took
charge
of
it
as
he
told
me
in
his
gossiping
way
let
alf
alone
he
knows
how
to
come
in
out
of
the
wet
in
fact
the
rainy
day
is
his
strong
point
such
for
the
third
and
last
time
is
life
whilst
i
spoke
my
unfortunate
companion
was
persistently
trying
to
light
his
empty
pipe
his
hands
trembling
and
his
breath
quickening
the
maroo
fly
was
at
him
again
i
tried
to
divert
his
attention
by
the
way
said
i
did
you
blame
thompson
and
cunningham
for
duffing
in
your
ten
or
twelve
months
ago
i
did
make
any
song
about
it
replied
the
boundary
rider
of
course
not
still
you
owe
them
an
apology
which
i
shall
be
happy
to
convey
if
you
wish
it
alf
morris
was
the
depredator
he
was
hovering
about
your
hut
that
night
like
a
guardian
angel
while
his
twenty
bullocks
had
their
going
on
your
grass
and
you
slept
the
sleep
of
the
unsuspecting
ask
old
jack
he
give
you
chapter
and
verse
without
much
pressing
he
told
me
about
it
this
afternoon
but
the
fit
came
on
after
all
the
boundary
man
stared
at
me
with
a
wild
shrinking
look
and
the
same
paling
of
the
lips
i
had
noticed
before
then
he
drank
the
remaining
water
out
of
the
cup
and
rising
from
his
seat
walked
slowly
to
his
bed
and
lay
down
with
his
face
toward
the
wall
far
gone
i
faith
thought
i
presently
i
went
to
the
door
and
shoring
up
one
of
the
posts
with
my
shoulder
looked
out
upon
the
cool
white
moonlight
flooding
the
level
landscape
strange
phenomena
follow
the
footsteps
of
night
it
has
long
been
observed
that
avalanches
and
landslips
occur
most
frequently
about
midnight
and
especially
on
moonless
midnights
when
the
sun
and
moon
are
in
conjunction
at
the
nadir
this
is
the
time
when
mines
cave
in
when
loose
bark
falls
from
trees
when
limbs
crash
down
from
old
dead
timber
when
branches
break
when
all
ponderable
bodies
of
relatively
slight
restraint
are
most
apt
to
lose
their
hold
this
may
be
definitely
and
satisfactorily
accounted
for
by
the
mere
operation
of
newton
law
at
the
time
and
under
the
conditions
specified
the
conjoined
attraction
of
sun
and
moon
an
attraction
sufficient
to
sway
millions
of
tons
of
water
in
the
spring
tides
is
superadded
to
the
centric
gravity
of
the
earth
the
triple
force
at
the
moment
of
midnight
tending
toward
the
nadir
or
downward
so
that
when
these
midnight
phenomena
are
most
observable
at
one
point
of
the
globe
they
will
be
least
likely
to
make
manifestation
at
the
antipodes
to
that
point
and
though
changes
of
the
moon
as
copiously
proved
by
meteorological
statistics
have
no
relation
whatever
to
rainfall
the
illuminated
moon
on
rising
will
rarely
fail
to
clear
a
clouded
sky
this
singular
influence
is
exercised
solely
by
the
cold
light
of
that
dead
satellite
producing
an
effect
which
the
sunlight
though
two
hundred
times
as
is
altogether
powerless
to
rival
in
kind
when
we
can
explain
the
nature
of
this
force
adherent
to
moonlight
and
to
no
other
light
we
may
inquire
why
in
all
ages
and
in
all
lands
the
verdict
of
experience
points
to
moonlight
as
a
factor
in
the
production
and
aggravation
of
lunacy
an
empirical
hypothesis
of
course
but
in
the
better
sense
as
well
as
in
the
worse
for
the
perturbing
influence
of
moonlight
if
it
be
a
myth
is
about
the
most
tenacious
one
on
earth
this
anomalous
form
of
force
may
or
may
not
be
observable
in
asylums
where
the
patients
are
not
directly
subjected
to
it
but
anyone
who
has
lived
in
the
back
country
camping
out
with
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
oddities
need
not
be
accounted
credulous
if
he
holds
the
word
to
rest
on
a
sounder
derivation
than
or
appended
to
the
end
of
the
final
chapter
the
proportional
intensity
of
sunlight
to
moonlight
is
subject
to
fluctuations
from
many
causes
and
is
therefore
variously
stated
the
highest
accepted
ratio
is
to
the
lowest
to
a
constutional
repugnance
to
anything
savouring
of
effect
prompted
me
to
indicate
the
lower
proportion
the
error
in
the
text
unfortunately
escaped
observation
but
the
moonlight
strong
chaste
and
beautiful
as
its
ideal
queen
soothes
and
elevates
the
mind
i
took
from
my
the
i
always
carry
and
sitting
on
the
floor
with
my
back
against
the
unbound
the
instrument
from
its
square
stick
and
began
to
play
it
is
not
the
highest
class
of
music
i
am
well
aware
and
this
paragraph
is
dictated
by
no
shallow
impulse
of
but
i
never
had
opportunity
to
master
any
more
complicated
instrument
and
even
if
i
had
it
would
be
much
use
for
i
know
only
about
three
tunes
and
these
by
no
means
perfectly
so
i
played
softly
and
voluptuously
till
my
scanty
repertory
was
exhausted
and
then
drifted
into
a
tender
capriccio
i
noticed
alf
move
uneasily
on
his
bed
but
knowing
the
effect
of
music
on
my
own
mind
and
remembering
moriarty
and
montgomery
independent
panegyrics
on
the
boundary
man
skill
i
felt
put
on
my
mettle
and
performed
with
a
power
and
feeling
which
surprised
myself
do
you
like
music
asked
alf
at
length
like
it
i
repeated
i
would
give
of
the
residue
of
my
life
to
be
a
good
singer
and
musician
as
it
is
i
not
much
of
a
player
and
still
less
of
a
vocalist
but
i
give
you
a
song
if
you
like
how
sweetly
everything
sounds
do
you
like
music
interrupted
alf
sitting
up
on
the
bed
not
if
i
could
play
any
better
instrument
such
as
the
violin
or
the
concertina
though
i
should
in
any
case
avoid
the
piano
for
fear
of
flattening
the
ends
of
my
fingers
still
the
is
a
and
this
is
the
very
best
i
could
find
in
the
market
humble
as
it
looks
and
humble
as
it
undeniably
is
it
has
sounded
in
every
nook
and
corner
of
riverina
last
time
i
took
it
out
it
was
to
give
a
poor
consumptive
old
blackfellow
a
treat
and
now
you
see
i
tune
to
please
a
peasant
ear
the
harp
a
king
had
loved
to
bear
i
give
you
a
tune
on
the
violin
if
you
like
exclaimed
my
companion
rising
to
his
feet
alf
i
carefully
my
simple
instrument
while
the
boundary
man
took
from
its
case
a
dusky
violin
then
he
turned
down
the
lamp
till
a
mere
bead
of
flame
showed
above
the
burner
resumed
his
seat
by
the
table
and
after
some
preliminary
screwing
and
testing
began
to
play
query
if
the
relation
of
moonlight
to
insanity
is
a
thing
to
be
derided
what
shall
we
say
of
the
influence
of
music
on
the
normal
mind
is
it
not
equally
unaccountable
in
operation
however
indisputable
in
effect
contemplate
music
from
a
scientific
standpoint
that
is
merely
as
a
succession
of
conveyed
from
the
instrument
to
the
ear
by
pulsations
of
the
atmosphere
or
of
some
other
intervening
medium
music
is
thus
reduced
to
a
series
of
definite
vibrations
a
certain
number
of
which
constitute
a
note
each
separate
note
has
three
distinct
properties
or
attributes
first
its
intensity
or
loudness
which
is
governed
by
the
height
depth
amplitude
for
these
amount
to
the
same
thing
of
the
waves
produced
in
the
medium
second
the
timbre
or
quality
which
is
regulated
by
the
shape
or
outline
of
these
waves
third
the
pitch
high
or
low
which
is
controlled
by
the
distance
from
crest
to
crest
of
the
or
as
we
say
from
node
to
node
of
the
vibrations
to
the
most
sensitive
human
ear
the
highest
limit
of
audibleness
is
reached
by
estimated
at
of
an
inch
from
node
to
node
equal
to
vibrations
per
second
the
extreme
of
lowness
to
which
our
sense
of
hearing
is
susceptible
has
been
placed
at
feet
from
node
to
node
or
vibrations
per
second
this
total
range
of
audibleness
covers
octaves
running
of
course
far
above
and
far
below
the
domain
of
music
the
extreme
highness
and
lowness
of
sounds
which
convey
musical
impression
are
represented
respectively
by
and
by
vibrations
per
second
or
by
sound
waves
in
the
former
case
of
inches
and
in
the
latter
of
feet
therefore
there
are
not
only
sounds
which
by
reason
of
highness
or
lowness
are
unmusical
but
beyond
these
others
to
which
the
tympanum
of
the
human
ear
is
insensible
nature
is
alive
with
such
sounds
each
carrying
its
three
distinct
properties
of
intensity
timbre
and
pitch
but
whilst
this
muddy
vesture
of
decay
doth
grossly
close
us
in
we
can
no
more
hear
them
than
we
can
hear
the
of
the
spheres
apt
term
for
that
celestial
harmony
of
motion
which
guides
the
myriad
orbs
of
the
universe
in
their
career
through
space
but
to
take
an
illustration
from
the
visual
faculty
any
sound
beyond
the
highest
limit
of
audibleness
would
resemble
a
surface
lined
so
minutely
and
closely
as
to
appear
perfectly
plain
whilst
a
sound
too
low
in
pitch
to
be
heard
would
be
represented
by
superficial
undulations
of
land
or
water
so
vast
in
extent
that
the
idea
of
unevenness
would
not
occur
we
have
fairly
trustworthy
evidence
that
whales
communicate
with
each
other
by
notes
so
low
in
pitch
by
so
long
in
range
so
few
per
second
that
no
human
ear
can
detect
them
bats
on
the
other
hand
utter
calls
so
such
rapid
pulsations
as
to
be
equally
inaudible
to
us
unison
of
musical
notes
is
attained
when
the
respective
numbers
of
pulsations
per
second
admit
a
low
for
instance
the
note
produced
by
vibrations
per
second
will
chord
with
one
produced
by
each
node
of
the
former
coinciding
with
each
alternate
node
of
the
latter
and
will
also
chord
and
will
produce
discord
and
worse
discord
and
so
on
the
science
of
musical
composition
lies
in
the
management
of
and
is
governed
by
certain
rigid
mathematical
laws
which
laws
the
composer
need
not
understand
may
of
course
take
place
without
for
air
is
only
incidentally
a
earth
metal
water
and
especially
wood
along
the
grain
are
better
media
than
the
atmosphere
for
the
transmission
of
sound
but
sound
may
be
transmitted
without
vibration
of
intervening
the
electric
current
passing
along
the
telephone
wire
picks
up
the
sound
waves
at
one
end
and
instantaneously
deposits
them
in
good
order
and
condition
at
the
other
end
say
a
couple
of
hundred
miles
away
so
that
the
brilliant
pianist
of
the
concert
hall
the
of
the
army
ring
the
blind
fiddler
at
the
corner
the
mother
singing
her
to
sleep
clancy
thundering
forth
something
concerning
his
broken
heart
whilst
tailing
up
the
stringing
cattle
the
canary
in
its
cage
the
magpie
on
the
fence
are
each
setting
in
motion
the
complex
machinery
of
music
and
with
about
equal
scientific
knowledge
of
what
they
are
doing
to
the
philosophic
mind
however
they
are
not
playing
or
singing
they
are
producing
and
controlling
arbitrarily
varied
in
duration
and
quality
a
series
of
such
pulsations
constituting
a
note
a
series
of
notes
constituting
an
air
these
vibrations
are
diffused
from
the
instrument
or
the
lips
at
a
speed
varying
with
temperature
media
and
other
conditions
they
ripple
spread
percolate
everywhere
they
penetrate
and
saturate
all
solids
and
gases
yet
are
palpable
corporeally
only
to
the
tympanum
of
the
ear
and
mechanically
as
yet
only
to
the
diaphragm
of
the
phonograph
such
however
is
the
scientific
analysis
of
music
spoken
language
appeals
by
the
same
process
but
with
very
different
effect
no
one
can
understand
a
language
which
he
has
not
previously
learned
word
by
word
and
the
verbal
appeal
however
imaginative
or
spiritual
comes
in
concrete
form
that
is
in
the
nature
of
information
spoken
words
inform
the
emotional
side
of
our
nature
through
the
intellectual
whereas
music
operating
outwardly
in
the
same
manner
speaks
over
the
head
of
intellect
to
an
inborn
sense
which
ceases
not
to
receive
as
a
little
child
and
herein
lies
its
mystery
for
the
music
thus
impassively
anatomised
by
science
is
a
voice
from
the
unseen
pregnant
with
meaning
beyond
translation
a
mere
ripple
of
called
into
existence
by
human
touch
a
creation
vanishing
from
its
birth
elusive
irreclaimable
as
a
departing
soul
yet
strong
to
sway
heart
and
hand
as
the
tornado
sways
the
pliant
pine
it
is
a
language
peculiar
to
no
period
race
or
caste
ageless
and
universal
it
raises
to
highest
daring
or
suffuses
with
tenderness
and
here
as
once
on

deck
or
in
the
halls
of
persepolis
purely
material
in
origin
and
analysis
easily
explicable
in
mere
physical
operation
its
influence
is
one
of
the
things
that
are
not
dreamt
of
in
the
philosophy
of
science
why
should
a
certain
psychological
effect
ensue
upon
certain
untranslatable
sounds
being
placed
in
a
given
relation
to
each
other
and
not
when
the
same
sounds
are
placed
in
another
relation
and
why
should
that
effect
be
always
upward
why
should
the
composer
be
perforce
a
prophet
of
the
sphere

for
alas
what

achievement
can
fancy
conceive
as
reproduced
in
regions
of
eternal
perfection
or

science
is
of
the

sad
penalty
in

and
what
art
save
music
has
man
dedicated
to
without
disappointment
and
loss
doubtfully
architecture
and
for
such
consecration
we
have
found
no
more
expressive
name
than
music
this
unknown
anchorite
playing
was
both
a
mystery
and
a
revelation
i
had
never
before
heard
anything
to
compare
with
it
nor
do
i
expect
ever
to
hear
the
like
again
talent
taste
feeling
were
there
all
in
superlative
degree
and
disclosed
with
the
unassuming
confidence
of
power
whilst
long
and
loving
practice
in
solitude
had
averted
a
certain
artificiality
which
in
the
judgment
of
the
uninitiated
generally
accompanies
musical
skill
his
was
no
triumphant
mastery
of
a
complicated
and
perplexing
score
he
was
a
sympathetic
interpreter
a
exponent
of
his
composer
revelations
now
his
own
solitary
practice
with
no
one
but
himself
to
please
would
unavoidably
give
a
distinct
character
to
his
performance
and
this
character
was
evident
from
the
first
it
was
melancholy
a
weary
wistful
melancholy
beyond
repining
or
tears
beyond
impatience
or
passion
it
was
the
involuntary
record
of
a
gentle
heart
breaking
slowly
under
discipline
untempered
by
one
ray
of
earthly
hope
my
own
incompetence
to
identify
by
name
a
tune
which
i
spiritually
recognise
is
perhaps
the
most
disgraceful
manifestation
of
my
neglected
musical
education
at
all
events
it
is
the
one
which
causes
me
most
uneasiness
experience
has
warned
me
never
to
ask
a
player
for
the
or
lie
down
or
what
not
for
he
is
pretty
sure
to
say
that
just
what
i
been
giving
you
or
words
to
similar
effect
alf
at
last
grew
tired
of
my
remarks
and
replies
and
with
a
tact
which
impressed
me
more
afterward
than
at
the
time
named
each
tune
before
and
after
playing
it
for
instance
the
yearning
tenderness
of
an
exquisitely
rendered
air
would
seem
to
bring
back
some
lost
consciousness
of
an
earlier
and
happier
existence
suffusing
my
whole
being
with
a
pensive
sadness
not
to
be
exchanged
for
any
joy
i
would
feel
the
notes
familiar
but
whether
of
five
years
or
five
million
years
before
or
whether
in
the
body
or
out
of
the
body
i
could
tell
alf
on
concluding
would
simply
murmur
home
sweet
home
and
all
would
be
explained
then
perhaps
he
would
say
the
last
rose
of
summer
and
i
would
be
able
to
follow
him
intelligently
right
through
but
he
did
confine
himself
to
the
comfortable
vulgarity
of
popular
airs
he
played
selections
from
handel
mozart
wagner
and
i
do
know
whom
while
the
time
passed
unnoticed
by
both
of
us
at
length
he
laid
the
violin
across
his
knees
and
after
a
pause
his
voice
rose
in
one
of
the
sweetest
songs
ever
woven
from
words
and
such
a
voice
rich
soft
transcendent
yet
suggesting
ungauged
resources
of
enchantment
unconsciously
held
in
reserve
i
sat
entranced
as
verse
after
verse
flowed
slowly
on
every
syllable
clear
and
distinct
as
in
speech
the
subtle
tyranny
of
vocal
harmony
admitting
no
intruding
thought
beyond
a
regretful
sense
that
the
song
must
end
but
sorrow
sel
wears
past
jean
and
joy
fast
jean
the
joy
that
aye
to
last
i
the
land
o
the
leal
a
our
freens
are
gane
jean
we
lang
been
left
alane
jean
we
a
meet
again
i
the
land
o
the
leal
how
happy
jean
armour
must
have
been
to
be
with
poor
burns
while
this
cold
world
seemed
to
slip
away
from
his
feet
and
leave
him
to
rest
with
his
forgiving
saviour
murmured
the
boundary
man
laying
his
violin
on
the
table
whilst
he
gazed
absently
into
the
expiring
fire
that
song
was
composed
by
burns
on
his
is
it
beautiful
it
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
songs
in
the
language
i
replied
but
burns
is
not
the
author
the
song
was
composed
by
a
woman
baroness
nairne
it
is
not
for
men
to
write
in
that
strain
as
for
jean
armour
well
she
had
a
good
deal
to
forgive
too
ah
do
you
think
a
woman
loves
less
because
she
has
much
to
forgive
returned
alf
sadly
and
then
added
with
sudden
interest
but
what
difference
do
you
notice
between
the
poetry
of
men
and
women
what
is
the
mark
of
women
work
sincerity
i
replied
notwithstanding
hemans
and
others
you
will
find
that
as
a
rule
men
poetry
is
superior
to
women
not
only
in
vigour
but
in
grace
this
is
not
strange
for
grace
is
after
all
a
display
of
force
an
aspect
of
strength
but
in
the
quality
of
sincerity
woman
is
a
good
first
take
an
illustration
while
i
think
of
it
compare
the
verses
of
my
ancestor
collins
the
grave
of
thompson
with
eliza
cook
verses
the
grave
of
good
but
collins
was
never
married
interposed
alf
true
i
replied
pleasantly
but
our
family
is
aristocratic
and
a
only
sets
us
off
however
in
the
two
poems
i
was
speaking
of
the
subject
matter
is
similar
the
pieces
are
about
the
same
length
and
the
writers
have
adopted
the
same
iambic
with
alternate
rhymes
now
my
ancestor
poem
is
not
excelled
in
grace
by
anything
within
the
range
of
our
literature
but
there
nothing
else
in
it
whatever
eliza
cook
versification
is
in
a
measure
forced
and
imperfect
her
language
occasionally
homely
and
rugged
but
the
strong
beating
of
a
sincere
sympathetic
heart
is
audible
in
every
line
but
your
ancestor
is
the
most
artificial
writer
of
an
artificial
school
and
eliza
cook
is
the
most
spontaneous
writer
of
a
spontaneous
school
replied
alf
with
the
contradictive
impulse
which
amusingly
accompanied
his
teachableness
of
course
he
added
deprecatingly
i
would
presume
to
criticise
such
a
poet
as
collins
but
you
said
yourself
oh
that
all
right
said
i
generously
however
though
your
argument
blunts
the
force
of
my
illustration
it
does
weaken
my
contention
you
find
the
distinction
i
hold
good
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
throughout
literature
you
find
examples
by
the
thousand
and
of
course
exceptions
by
the
dozen
but
sing
again
alf
please
every
minute
you
silent
is
a
minute
wasted
sing
anything
you
like
only
sing
i
wanted
to
have
a
talk
remonstrated
alf
you
were
speaking
of
the
difference
between
men
and
women
in
their
literary
work
i
believe
you
right
though
it
never
struck
me
before
now
there
another
question
that
might
be
worth
comparing
notes
upon
your
remark
just
brought
it
into
my
mind
here
it
is
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
went
on
with
a
certain
constraint
in
his
voice
the
constraint
we
are
apt
to
feel
when
forced
to
plump
out
the
word
in
its
narrower
sense
when
women
love
they
do
know
why
they
love
they
just
love
because
they
do
so
they
say
and
we
bound
to
believe
them
but
when
we
love
women
why
do
we
love
them
being
more
logical
we
ought
to
know
do
we
love
a
woman
for
her
beauty
or
for
her
virtues
or
for
her
accomplishments
or
for
what
i
fancy
if
we
understood
ourselves
we
should
be
able
to
say
we
loved
her
for
some
particular
quality
and
the
others
are
as
you
might
say
oh
you
know
what
quality
is
it
then
that
we
love
a
woman
for
there
a
problem
for
you
i
can
solve
it
with
mathematical
certainty
alf
that
is
to
say
in
such
a
manner
as
to
convey
the
impossibility
of
the
solution
being
otherwise
than
according
to
my
finding
when
i
allowed
to
these
things
in
my
own
circuitous
way
which
is
seldom
the
case
there
are
few
questions
in
moral
or
psychological
philosophy
which
the
commission
of
my
years
and
art
can
to
no
issue
of
true
honour
bring
but
you
have
to
sing
six
songs
first
i
leave
the
choice
of
them
to
yourself
very
well
replied
alf
readily
i
sing
the
songs
as
they
come
to
my
mind
remember
your
promise
now
then
rich
soft
and
sweet
rose
that
exquisite
voice
in
easy
volume
flooding
with
new
and
vivid
meaning
old
familiar
verses
here
was
my
opportunity
i
was
interested
in
this
boundary
man
and
resolved
to
know
his
history
rejecting
alf
jones
as
an
assumed
name
nomenology
would
be
at
fault
here
yet
knowing
already
by
a
kind
of
incommunicable
intuition
that
he
was
a
and
had
been
in
some
way
connected
with
the
i
expected
to
have
my
knowledge
so
supplemented
by
the
character
of
his
songs
that
counting
reasonably
on
a
little
further
information
to
be
gathered
before
my
departure
i
should
be
able
to
his
biography
at
least
as
correctly
as
biographies
are
generally
for
the
esoteric
side
of
his
history
i
counted
much
on
his
spontaneous
choice
of
songs
man
is
but
a
lyre
in
both
senses
of
the
word
unfortunately
and
some
salient
experience
some
thought
some
clinging
hope
is
the
plectrum
which
strikes
the
passive
chords
an
old
truism
will
bear
expansion
here
till
it
embraces
the
rule
that
whatever
else
a
man
may
sing
he
always
sings
himself
but
you
must
know
how
to
interpret
i
have
said
that
melancholy
was
the
of
alf
playing
fused
with
this
and
deeply
coloured
by
it
the
tendency
of
his
songs
was
toward
love
and
love
alone
chaste
supersensuous
but
purely
human
and
exclusive
love
no
suggestion
of
national
inspiration
no
broad
human
sympathies
no
echo
of
the
oppressed
ones
cry
no
stern
challenge
of
wrong
only
a
hopeless
undying
love
and
an
unspeakable
he
was
even
a
lyre
he
was
a
pipe
for
fortune
finger
to
sound
what
stop
she
pleased
and
judging
from
the
tone
of
his
playing
and
the
selection
of
his
songs
it
had
pleased
that
irresponsible
goddess
to
attune
the
chords
of
his
being
to
a
love
pure
as
heaven
sad
as
earth
and
hopeless
as
the
other
place
who
is
she
thought
i
silence
again
sank
on
the
faint
yellow
lamplight
of
the
hut
as
the
last
syllables
of
the
sixth
song
died
mournfully
away
is
far
from
the
land
where
her
young
hero
sleeps
then
the
boundary
rider
lit
his
pipe
and
slightly
moved
his
seat
placing
himself
in
an
easy
listening
attitude
with
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
his
hand
across
his
face
alf
said
i
impressively
you
certainly
find
yourself
shot
into
outer
darkness
if
you
do
alter
your
hand
you
recklessly
transgressing
the
lesson
set
forth
in
the
parable
of
the
talents
do
you
know
it
wrong
to
bury
yourself
here
eating
your
own
life
away
with
melancholia
seeing
that
you
gifted
as
you
are
maestros
and
highclass
critics
and
other
unwholesomely
cultured
people
might
possibly
sit
on
you
or
damn
you
with
faint
praise
but
you
could
afford
to
take
chance
of
that
for
beyond
all
doubt
the
million
would
idolise
you
i
not
looking
at
the
business
aspect
of
the
thing
i
thinking
of
the
humanising
influence
you
would
exercise
and
the
happiness
you
would
confer
and
altogether
of
the
unmixed
good
that
would
lie
to
your
credit
if
you
made
the
intended
use
of
your
lord
money
and
here
you
are
burying
it
in
the
earth
o
i
would
be
here
i
suppose
only
for
the
disfigurement
of
my
face
he
replied
swallowing
a
sob
that
nothing
i
interjected
deeply
pained
by
his
allusion
and
inwardly
soliciting
forgiveness
without
repentance
whilst
i
spoke
did
the
british
think
less
of
nelson
did
lady
hamilton
think
less
of
him
if
it
comes
to
that
for
the
loss
of
his
arm
and
his
eye
why
even
the
conceited
german
students
value
scars
on
the
face
more
than
academic
honours
believe
me
alf
while
a
man
merely
conducts
himself
as
a
man
his
scars
need
cost
him
a
thought
but
if
he
an
artist
as
you
are
what
might
otherwise
be
a
disfigurement
becomes
the
highest
claim
to
respect
and
sympathy
it
pure
effeminancy
to
brood
over
such
things
for
that
just
where
we
have
the
advantage
of
women
woman
first
duty
says
the
proverb
to
be
beautiful
if
lady
hamilton
had
been
minus
an
eye
and
an
arm
she
would
scarcely
have
attained
her
unfortunate
celebrity
the
boundary
man
laid
down
his
pipe
rested
his
forehead
on
his
arm
upon
the
table
and
for
a
minute
or
two
sobbed
like
a
child
it
was
dreadful
to
see
him
he
was
worse
than
ida
in
an
argument
with
beaudesart
he
was
as
bad
as
an
australian
judge
passing
mitigated
sentence
on
some
criminal
presently
he
rose
and
walked
unsteadily
to
the
other
end
of
the
hut
his
dog
with
a
low
pathetic
whine
following
him
perceiving
that
he
was
off
again
i
turned
up
the
flame
of
the
lamp
with
a
view
to
neutralising
the
effect
of
the
moonlight
are
you
not
well
alf
no
answer
he
was
lying
on
his
back
on
the
bed
one
arm
across
his
face
and
the
other
hanging
down
whilst
his
dog
crouched
at
the
bedside
was
silently
licking
the
brown
fingers
then
my
eye
happened
to
fall
on
the
american
clock
over
the
not
that
time
surely
but
my
watch
had
beaten
the
clock
by
ten
minutes
i
say
alf
i
do
know
how
to
apologise
for
keeping
you
up
till
this
time
it
eleven
still
no
answer
i
brought
in
my
and
began
to
spread
it
on
the
floor
alf
had
risen
and
rolled
his
blankets
back
off
the
bed
he
now
took
out
the
mattress
of
dried
grass
and
laid
it
on
the
floor
then
his
blankets
but
i
certainly
wo
rob
you
of
your
tick
said
i
one
characteristic
of
childhood
i
still
retain
is
the
ability
to
sleep
anywhere
like
a
dog
you
must
take
it
if
you
sleep
in
this
hut
he
replied
curtly
take
that
too
he
handed
me
his
feather
pillow
do
you
shut
your
door
at
nights
i
asked
because
if
you
do
i
chain
pup
to
the
fence
he
likes
to
go
in
and
out
at
his
own
pleasure
and
if
he
found
himself
he
might
get
lost
it
can
stay
open
replied
alf
right
said
i
and
i
began
to
disrobe
as
i
always
do
when
circumstances
permit
sleeping
with
your
clothes
on
is
slovenly
sleeping
with
your
spurs
on
is
in
addition
ruinously
destructive
to
even
the
strongest
alf
i
remarked
as
i
pulled
off
my
socks
i
was
forgetting
your
problem
the
solution
is
clear
enough
to
me
but
the
inquiry
opens
out
no
end
of
each
of
which
must
be
followed
out
to
its
with
the
main
line
of
argument
if
we
wish
to
leave
our
conclusion
unassailable
at
any
point
the
question
then
is
do
we
love
a
woman
for
her
beauty
for
her
virtues
or
for
her
accomplishments
now
let
us
make
sure
of
our
terminology
i
paused
but
alf
maintained
silence
in
the
first
place
i
continued
kicking
off
the
garment
which
it
is
unlawful
even
to
name
we
must
inquire
what
the
personal
beauty
of
woman
is
and
wherein
it
consists
it
consists
in
approximation
to
a
given
ideal
and
this
ideal
is
not
absolute
it
is
elastic
in
respect
of
races
and
civilisations
though
each
type
may
be
regarded
as
more
or
less
rigid
within
its
own
domain
passing
over
such
racial
ideals
as
the
hottentot
venus
and
waiving
comparison
between
the
riverine
ideal
of
fifty
years
ago
and
that
of
we
have
the
typical
eve
of
flanders
as
one
ideal
and
the
typical
eve
of
italy
as
another
again
i
paused
but
alf
remained
silent
moreover
i
continued
settling
myself
down
into
the
comfortable
mattress
if
no
specimen
of
classic
art
had
survived
the
dark
ages
i
question
whether
we
would
implicitly
accept
as
our
present
ideal
the
chiselled
profile
in
which
physiognomists
fail
to
find
any
special
indications
of
moral
or
intellectual
excellence
but
when
we
based
our
modern
civilisation
on
the
relics
of
classic
greece
directly
or
through
rome
we
naturally
accepted
the
ideal
of
beauty
then
and
there
current
attila
or
abderrahman
might
have
deflected
the
european
standard
of
beauty
into
a
widely
different
ideal
but
it
was
not
to
be
and
we
too
prone
to
accept
our
classic
ideal
as
being
identified
with
civilisation
and
refinement
we
should
remember
that
the
flat
features
of
the
coptic
ideal
looked
out
on
high
attainments
in
art
and
science
when
our
hellenic
archetypes
in
spite
of
their
chiselled
profiles
were
drifting
across
from
the
in
the
stage
of
civilisation
also
the
ideal
of
china
has
a
decent
record
further
still
the
german
is
facially
coarser
and
mentally
higher
than
the
circassian
again
i
paused
are
you
sleepy
asked
alf
gently
but
significantly
i
ought
to
be
i
replied
humouring
his
present
caprice
though
grieved
to
withhold
the
solution
which
he
had
so
earnestly
desired
an
hour
before
just
as
the
secondary
use
of
the
bee
is
to
make
honey
and
his
primary
one
to
teach
us
habits
of
industry
so
the
secondary
use
of
the
hen
is
to
lay
eggs
and
her
primary
one
to
teach
us
proper
hours
but
unfortunately
we
do
avail
ourselves
of
the
lessons
written
for
us
in
the
book
of
nature
we
simply
eat
the
honey
and
the
eggs
allowing
our
capability
and
reason
to
fust
in
us
unused
such
is
life
alf
and
in
thirty
seconds
i
was
asleep
on
awaking
as
usual
to
listen
for
bells
i
became
conscious
of
something
between
a
sigh
and
a
groan
outside
the
hut
this
was
repeated
again
and
again
until
actuated
by
compassion
rather
than
curiosity
i
crept
to
the
door
and
looked
out
six
or
eight
yards
away
alf
was
kneeling
at
the
fence
his
arms
on
one
of
the
wires
and
the
poor
disfigured
face
wet
with
tears
turned
westward
to
the
pitiless
moon
now
just
setting
thou
art
in
a
parlous
state
shepherd
thought
i
and
it
then
occurred
to
me
that
my
own
acute
philosophic
temperament
was
one
of
the
things
i
ought
to
be
thankful
for
but
i
could
feel
thankful
i
could
only
feel
powerless
and
in
the
presence
of
a
distress
which
seemed
proof
against
palliative
let
alone
antidote
at
length
the
moon
disappeared
then
the
boundary
man
forehead
sank
on
his
arms
a
calm
came
over
him
and
i
knew
that
his
shapeless
vagaries
had
taken
form
in
prayer
so
i
withdrew
to
my
speculating
on
the
mysterious
effect
of
a
ray
of
lunar
light
on
grey
matter
protected
by
various
plies
of
apparently
natural
armour
when
i
woke
again
the
early
sunlight
was
streaming
through
the
open
door
and
alf
with
a
short
veil
of
crape
concealing
the
middle
of
his
face
was
frying
chops
at
the
fire
the
fit
had
passed
away
and
he
was
perfectly
sane
and
cheerful
my
first
solicitude
was
for
pup
but
i
soon
saw
that
he
was
more
than
merely
safe
he
was
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
gorged
like
a
while
a
pair
of
feet
still
attached
to
the
loosened
rope
were
all
that
remained
of
the
turkey
probably
he
had
stood
on
his
scratching
at
the
rope
till
the
hitch
hurriedly
secured
in
the
first
place
had
come
undone
i
was
too
well
accustomed
to
such
things
to
feel
any
embarrassment
and
as
for
alf
i
could
help
thinking
that
the
loss
of
his
turkey
enhanced
the
cordiality
of
his
manner
grandest
dog
i
seen
for
years
he
remarked
as
he
set
the
table
do
you
get
many
kangaroos
with
him
oh
no
i
replied
i
never
get
one
and
do
intend
to
i
never
let
him
go
after
anything
it
quite
enough
and
sometimes
more
than
enough
for
him
to
do
his
regular
travelling
the
hot
weather
comes
very
severe
on
him
in
fact
some
days
i
have
to
give
him
a
drink
every
hour
or
oftener
then
he
has
the
hard
ground
to
contend
with
and
when
the
rain
comes
the
dirt
sticks
between
his
toes
and
annoys
him
windy
weather
is
bad
for
him
too
and
frost
puts
a
set
on
him
altogether
then
he
always
swarming
with
fleas
and
in
addition
to
that
the
flies
have
a
particular
fancy
for
him
and
seeing
that
one
half
of
the
population
is
always
plotting
to
steal
him
and
the
other
half
trying
to
poison
him
while
for
his
own
part
he
has
a
confirmed
habit
of
getting
lost
you
may
be
sure
we
have
plenty
to
occupy
our
minds
without
thinking
about
kangaroos
he
considerably
more
trouble
to
me
than
all
my
money
but
he
worth
it
as
you
say
he
a
fine
dog
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
without
him
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
without
my
dog
either
replied
alf
and
he
related
some
marvellous
stories
of
the
animal
sagacity
to
which
of
course
i
could
respond
on
pup
behalf
then
whilst
we
and
rode
off
together
at
a
walk
the
conversation
naturally
drifted
to
horses
until
about
ten
when
we
stopped
at
a
little
in
the
corner
of
alf
paddock
you
in
the
patagonia
paddock
now
said
he
as
i
passed
through
the
gate
you
strike
the
track
in
six
miles
can
i
do
anything
for
you
at
the
station
he
added
after
a
pause
any
message
or
anything
yes
alf
if
you
be
so
good
when
will
you
be
going
across
he
replied
i
not
going
round
the
paddock
i
drew
my
from
bunyip
pack
and
this
was
the
note
i
pencilled
wallaby
track
dear
jack
when
you
remarked
yesterday
that
the
saddle
on
my
horse
was
very
like
one
that
a
galoot
had
stolen
from
you
you
displayed
a
creditable
acuteness
combined
with
a
still
more
creditable
unsuspiciousness
it
was
your
saddle
once
but
it
is
yours
no
longer
it
is
mine
demand
not
how
the
prize
i
hold
it
was
not
given
nor
lent
nor
sold
rokeby
you
will
find
three
notes
in
this
letter
please
accept
the
same
as
compensation
for
loss
of
the
article
in
question
this
is
all
you
are
likely
to
get
for
though
the
saddle
is
honestly
worth
about
twice
that
amount
my
conscience
now
acquits
me
in
the
matter
moreover
my
official
salary
is
so
judiciously
proportioned
to
my
frugal
requirements
that
i
can
afford
no
more
if
you
duly
receive
this
money
and
at
the
same
time
feel
hopelessly
mystified
concerning
the
saddle
a
double
purpose
will
be
fulfilled
yours
in
a
manner
of
speaking
thomas
collins
i
put
this
into
jack
hand
if
i
live
said
the
boundary
man
with
amusing
solemnity
as
he
buttoned
his
over
the
letter
thank
you
alf
and
now
i
continued
retaining
for
a
moment
the
hand
he
extended
in
farewell
take
my
advice
and
while
you
at
the
station
give
montgomery
notice
let
some
more
capable
boundary
man
take
your
place
you
not
worth
your
damper
at
this
work
for
no
man
ability
is
comprehensive
enough
to
cover
musical
proficiency
such
as
yours
and
leave
the
narrowest
flap
available
for
anything
else
i
can
see
through
you
like
glass
i
could
write
your
biography
and
believe
me
you
no
more
fitted
for
this
life
than
you
are
to
preside
over
a
school
of
stoic
philosophy
you
a
reed
shaken
by
the
wind
be
a
man
alf
turn
your
face
eastward
or
southward
and
challenge
fortune
with
your
violin
and
your
voice
he
made
no
reply
but
below
the
edge
of
the
crape
mask
i
saw
his
lips
move
as
he
bent
his
head
in
unconscious
acquiescence
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterward
i
looked
back
to
see
him
and
his
history
a
shapeless
speck
far
away
along
the
diminishing
perspective
of
the
line
of
fence
there
was
something
impressive
in
the
recollection
that
during
the
whole
of
our
companionship
he
had
never
uttered
one
objectionable
or
uncharitable
word
nor
attempted
any
witticism
respecting
beaudesart
chapter
vii
the
reader
however
unruly
under
weaker
management
is
by
this
time
made
aware
of
a
power
beyond
his
own
likes
and
dislikes
controlling
the
selection
and
treatment
of
these
informal
annals
that
power
in
the
nature
of
things
resides
napoleonically
with
myself
and
has
i
trust
been
exercised
toward
the
information
and
edification
of
the
few
who
fall
under
its
jurisdiction
suggesting
as
it
does
tom
hood
idea
of
perfect
rule
an
angel
from
heaven
and
a
despotism
encouraged
by
this
assurance
and
prompted
as
usual
by
a
refinement
which
some
might
construe
into
fastidiousness
i
shall
once
more
avail
myself
of
the
prerogative
hitherto
so
profitably
sustained
the
routine
record
of
march
is
not
a
desirable
text
it
would
merely
call
forth
from
fitting
oblivion
the
of
two
stalwart
fencers
by
a
pimply
old
and
you
know
this
sort
of
thing
has
been
described
ad
sickenum
by
other
pens
less
proper
than
mine
described
in
fact
till
you
would
think
that
in
the
drinking
took
the
place
of
conduct
as
of
life
whilst
the
remaining
fourth
consisted
of
fighting
whereas
outside
the
shearing
season
you
might
travel
a
hundred
miles
calling
at
five
shanties
without
seeing
a
man
the
worse
for
drink
and
you
would
be
still
more
likely
to
go
a
thousand
miles
calling
at
fifty
shanties
without
seeing
any
indication
of
a
fight
of
course
there
are
some
queer
tragedies
and
many
melancholy
farces
enacted
at
the
shanties
but
speaking
in
a
broad
statistical
way
the
gets
such
a
miserably
small
percentage
of
the
money
earned
that
he
usually
lives
in
indigence
and
dies
in
the
odour
of
very
inferior
liquor
here
and
there
the
exceptional
case
of
a
retiring
on
his
congealed
ability
goes
to
show
the
fatuity
of
the
curse
hypothesis
rounding
us
up
on
the
one
unassailable
bit
of
namely
that
such
is
life
it
would
do
you
no
good
to
hear
how
the
old
major
he
was
an
of
the
imperial
army
fawned
on
my
officialship
and
threw
himself
in
rapport
with
my
gentlemanship
how
his
haggard
handsome
wife
leered
at
me
over
his
shoulder
how
the
asses
of
fencers
in
weary
alternation
confidentially
told
me
fragmentary
and
idiotic
yarns
how
they
shook
hands
with
me
till
i
was
tired
and
wept
over
me
till
i
was
disgusted
how
they
irrelevantly
and
profusely
apologised
for
anything
they
might
have
said
and
abjectly
besought
me
if
i
felt
anyway
nasty
to
take
it
out
of
their
adj
hides
i
say
it
would
do
you
no
good
so
for
this
and
two
other
reasons
i
shall
take
as
my
text
the
entry
of
march
and
a
portion
of
the
following
verse
this
arbitrary
departure
in
dates
will
give
you
another
glimpse
of
alf
jones
also
the
peculiar
of
my
style
of
narrative
will
take
in
a
rencontre
with
another
person
to
whom
in
your
helpless
state
as
a
reader
you
have
already
been
introduced
and
if
you
take
it
not
patiently
the
more
is
your
mettle
march
wilcannia
shower
jack
the
shellback
sat
march
to
runnymede
tom
armstrong
and
mate
i
had
spent
the
night
of
the
at
burke
camp
on
boottara
my
horses
faring
decently
for
the
season
burke
the
regular
had
been
off
work
for
a
month
keeping
his
twenty
horses
and
bullocks
in
the
abbotsford
paddock
and
watering
them
daily
at
granger
tank
the
abbotsford
paddock
having
gone
dry
in
the
spring
had
fair
grass
in
it
but
of
course
no
station
stock
in
spite
of
all
the
loafing
i
could
do
the
season
was
telling
on
my
horses
their
hoofs
were
worn
to
the
similitude
of
quoits
you
could
count
their
ribs
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
and
they
had
acquired
that
crease
down
the
hip
pathetically
known
as
poor
man
stripe
cleopatra
bucking
had
become
feeble
and
mechanical
and
so
transparently
stagey
that
i
used
to
be
ashamed
of
it
still
my
aversion
to
lending
the
horse
or
having
him
duffed
compelled
me
to
keep
his
performance
up
to
the
highest
standard
compatible
with
justice
to
himself
runnymede
homestead
to
which
that
strange
fatality
was
again
driving
me
was
thirty
miles
from
burke
camp
but
by
losing
a
few
miles
in
a
slight
detour
i
could
make
a
stage
to
alf
jones
and
next
day
a
stage
to
the
station
this
rate
of
travelling
with
frequent
holidays
was
fast
enough
for
a
man
without
official
hopes
or
corresponding
fear
of
the
sack
if
alf
was
gone
so
much
the
better
for
himself
if
he
was
still
in
the
old
spot
so
much
the
better
for
me
that
was
the
way
i
looked
at
it
in
view
of
the
ignorance
which
saturates
society
it
may
be
well
to
repeat
that
this
central
point
of
the
universe
riverina
proper
consists
of
a
wide
promontory
of
open
and
level
plain
coming
in
from
the
broken
of
course
by
many
pine
ridges
clumps
of
red
box
patches
of
scrub
or
timber
and
the
inevitable
red
gum
flats
which
fringe
the
rivers
eastward
the
plain
runs
out
irregularly
into
open
forests
of
white
box
pine
and
other
timber
northward
something
over
a
couple
of
hundred
miles
from
the
murray
the
tortuous
frontier
of
boundless
scrub
meets
the
plain
with
the
abruptness
of
a
wall
boottara
is
half
plain
and
half
scrub
runnymede
is
practically
all
plain
when
i
left
burke
camp
heading
for
alf
paddock
there
was
a
strong
dry
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
then
useless
wind
tearing
through
the
tops
of
the
trees
i
thought
it
might
lull
before
i
left
the
shelter
of
the
scrub
but
it
only
increased
the
willowy
foliage
of
the
scattered
myalls
on
the
plain
stood
out
horizontally
to
leeward
and
an
endless
supply
of
were
chasing
each
other
across
the
level
ground
i
lashed
my
hat
on
with
a
handkerchief
one
side
of
the
brim
being
turned
down
to
keep
some
of
the
sand
and
dust
out
of
my
the
horses
with
ears
flattened
backward
and
muzzles
slanted
out
to
leeward
caught
the
storm
on
their
polls
and
leaning
sideways
against
the
pressure
pushed
on
gallantly
they
remembered
alf
grass
as
well
as
i
remembered
his
music
about
having
crossed
the
main
track
diagonally
without
seeing
it
i
came
upon
the
portable
engine
and
centrifugal
pump
belonging
to
runnymede
set
up
for
work
at
patagonia
tank
on
a
station
like
runnymede
a
tank
is
whenever
possible
excavated
on
the
margin
of
a
swamp
the
clay
extracted
is
formed
into
a
strong
wall
or
enclosing
embankment
a
couple
of
yards
back
from
the
edge
of
the
excavation
and
under
this
wall
an
iron
pipe
connects
the
swamp
with
the
tank
the
swamp
being
full
and
the
water
in
the
tank
having
reached
the
same
level
the
outer
end
of
the
pipe
is
closed
and
the
portable
pumping
plant
sent
out
to
fill
the
space
inside
the
wall
thus
doubling
the
capacity
of
the
tank
three
days
before
the
time
i
speak
of
a
thunderstorm
of
a
few
miles
area
had
filled
the
patagonia
swamp
and
montgomery
dreading
a
rainless
winter
had
seized
the
opportunity
to
secure
a
supply
of
water
the
pumping
plant
had
been
on
the
evening
before
but
not
started
and
now
the
wind
had
swept
all
the
water
to
the
other
end
of
the
swamp
the
and
his
mate
had
struck
their
tent
to
prevent
its
being
blown
away
and
were
lying
in
the
lee
of
the
tank
wall
trying
to
get
a
smoke
young
mooney
had
come
early
from
the
station
to
see
how
the
pump
started
and
had
been
drawn
into
a
controversy
with
his
colt
the
point
in
dispute
being
whether
it
was
safe
to
go
within
forty
yards
of
the
engine
mooney
had
maintained
the
affirmative
and
the
colt
the
negative
the
pure
logic
which
the
colt
had
opposed
to
mooney
applied
logic
had
ultimately
prevailed
and
the
narangy
had
withdrawn
from
the
argument
on
his
ear
whilst
the
colt
had
disappeared
through
the
rising
now
mooney
was
sitting
in
the
lee
of
the
embankment
cursing
the
day
he
elected
to
be
a
squatter
rather
than
a
clergyman
i
watered
my
horses
and
pup
at
the
tank
condoled
with
mooney
joined
the
two
other
chaps
in
severe
criticism
on
the
weather
replenished
my
and
passed
on
i
may
add
that
the
pump
was
started
on
that
occasion
at
all
the
water
being
blown
clean
out
of
the
swamp
and
scattered
fine
as
dust
through
the
thirsty
atmosphere
the
steady
intensity
of
the
shower
augmented
as
i
went
on
it
got
under
my
hat
and
the
next
moment
that
product
of
german
industry
was
flying
across
the
wilderness
for
the
good
of
trade
at
last
i
had
to
the
increasing
broadside
pressure
with
the
sand
and
dust
was
becoming
too
much
for
the
horses
and
in
any
case
i
should
have
had
to
stop
on
pup
account
i
turned
cleopatra
head
to
leeward
and
began
carefully
to
dismount
but
the
wind
ballooned
the
back
of
my
coat
and
the
right
branch
of
my
other
garment
and
i
went
three
yards
through
the
air
like
a
bird
shot
on
the
wing
recovering
foothold
i
fought
my
way
to
bunyip
and
relieved
him
of
his
pack
then
with
cleopatra
rein
over
my
arm
i
sat
down
on
the
ground
to
see
it
out
at
this
low
elevation
the
air
was
thick
with
skipping
crumbs
of
hard
dirt
which
rattled
on
my
skull
like
hail
in
fact
everything
not
anchored
to
the
ground
was
at
racing
speed
and
all
in
the
same
direction
but
this
strong
thirsty
wind
coming
from
the
deserts
with
a
clear
fetch
of
a
thousand
miles
was
not
going
to
last
many
hours
meantime
i
set
myself
to
work
out
scientifically
its
genesis
operation
and
hidden
purpose
the
first
and
second
considerations
were
merely
matters
of
research
and
calculation
the
third
was
largely
speculative
admitting
of
no
more
definite
conclusion
than
that
the
time
had
come
when
hygienic
necessities
required
a
thorough
rousing
and
of
microbes
bacteria
and
other
pests
too
minute
to
be
worth
particularising
but
i
was
better
enlightened
before
another
day
had
gone
over
my
head
whilst
engaged
in
these
not
unpleasing
studies
i
caught
a
momentary
glimpse
of
something
ten
yards
away
to
the
left
which
seemed
to
be
moving
slowly
against
the
wind
the
volume
of
flying
dust
was
of
course
far
from
uniform
in
density
and
presently
i
caught
sight
of
the
object
again
it
was
a
man
creeping
slowly
and
painfully
across
the
stubbly
knobs
of
on
his
hands
and
knees
i
hailed
him
in
a
voice
that
took
the
skin
off
my
throat
but
another
glimpse
showed
him
still
travelling
his
head
bent
almost
to
the
ground
i
rose
carefully
to
my
feet
facing
the
shower
but
only
to
be
hurled
down
on
top
of
the
faithful
pup
and
savagely
snapped
at
then
i
went
like
a
quadruped
till
i
reached
the
wayfarer
and
caught
him
by
the
ankle
he
looked
round
i
beckoned
and
crept
back
to
my
former
seat
whilst
he
followed
close
behind
then
a
bearded
haggard
resolute
face
framed
by
an
old
hat
tied
down
over
the
ears
confronted
me
you
look
like
some
worn
and
weary
brother
pulling
hard
against
the
stream
i
shouted
the
dry
cracked
lips
moved
without
speech
and
the
bloodshot
eyes
left
my
face
to
scan
the
beside
me
water
i
suggested
he
nodded
cleopatra
was
close
behind
me
propped
against
the
wind
i
drew
myself
up
by
the
near
stirrup
till
i
could
unbuckle
the
from
the
cantle
though
filled
with
half
a
gallon
of
water
not
two
hours
before
it
was
now
i
drew
the
cork
my
visitor
clasped
the
cool
damp
canvas
between
his
trembling
hands
and
with
fine
barely
wetted
his
lips
again
and
again
at
last
he
took
a
moderate
drink
making
for
patagonia
tank
he
hoarsely
remarked
you
were
going
past
it
it
about
a
mile
and
a
half
straight
across
there
i
just
come
from
it
disappointed
of
water
last
night
he
continued
it
was
dark
when
i
struck
the
little
tank
i
was
making
for
and
i
found
her
dry
and
my
throat
like
a
too
to
go
any
further
so
i
rested
till
morning
and
then
struck
for
the
patagonia
with
a
devil
of
a
headache
to
help
me
along
i
knew
of
another
tank
nearer
but
i
would
trust
myself
to
find
her
in
the
dust
i
helped
to
sink
the
patagonia
fine
tank
ai
she
have
you
no
swag
i
had
a
very
good
one
a
few
hours
ago
but
lord
knows
where
she
is
now
i
left
her
behind
when
the
wind
put
me
on
kept
pretty
well
in
the
same
quarter
i
think
about
the
same
that
be
a
bit
of
a
guide
you
be
staying
here
till
she
there
nothing
else
i
can
do
well
i
stay
with
you
if
you
shoot
me
straight
for
the
swamp
i
be
right
i
spell
at
the
tank
and
then
have
a
try
for
my
swag
you
find
two
very
decent
coves
camped
at
the
tank
with
the
engine
and
pump
they
put
you
on
your
feet
good
again
which
way
are
you
travelling
i
asked
any
way
work
scarce
contractors
camped
for
want
of
water
too
late
for
nothing
doing
i
wish
to
god
the
rabbits
would
come
something
worth
while
and
so
the
profitless
conversation
conversation
is
generally
profitless
went
on
by
fits
and
starts
till
the
sand
and
ceased
to
drift
later
it
was
an
almost
perfect
calm
though
the
air
was
still
charged
with
dust
by
this
time
i
had
and
was
ready
to
start
my
guest
was
now
on
his
feet
but
shaky
enough
with
impartiality
i
meted
out
half
a
pint
of
water
to
him
the
same
quantity
to
pup
and
the
remaining
to
myself
got
a
bit
of
tobacco
to
spare
he
asked
mine
all
in
my
swag
certainly
i
replied
are
you
because
i
can
lend
you
five
bob
till
we
meet
again
no
i
got
a
couple
or
three
notes
left
and
even
if
i
had
i
think
twice
before
i
touched
your
money
money
a
peculiar
thing
especially
in
the
sense
of
being
peculiar
to
certain
sections
of
society
i
replied
now
strike
straight
across
there
and
you
fetch
the
tank
in
a
mile
and
a
half
what
your
name
he
demanded
as
i
placed
my
foot
in
the
stirrup
collins
well
my
horses
went
off
freely
i
struck
the
with
accuracy
and
bowled
on
toward
the
declining
sun
which
showed
dull
and
coppery
through
suspended
dust
till
just
at
that
hour
which
calls
the
faithful
mussulman
to
prayer
and
the
no
less
faithful
sundowner
to
the
station
store
i
reached
my
destination
one
glance
was
enough
two
strange
horses
were
in
the
paddock
the
still
stood
in
the
sheltered
angle
by
the
chimney
but
the
flowers
were
dead
the
radius
round
the
door
was
no
longer
swept
except
by
the
winds
of
heaven
and
was
becoming
a
midden
whence
antiquaries
of
future
ages
might
sift
out
priceless
relics
with
unpronounceable
names
a
strange
dog
came
to
the
gave
a
single
bark
and
then
jack
the
shellback
appeared
and
recognising
me
got
a
larger
quantity
of
profanity
and
indecency
into
his
cordial
welcome
than
you
might
think
possible
scarce
as
water
was
he
cursed
me
into
washing
the
sand
out
of
my
hair
with
two
consecutive
goes
of
the
precious
liquid
whilst
he
swore
the
saddles
of
my
horses
and
some
supper
for
me
even
before
the
shower
the
whole
area
of
my
mortal
shrine
back
from
mark
round
neck
and
wrists
had
been
with
a
thousand
samples
of
dust
patiently
collected
over
the
same
number
of
miles
but
that
did
trouble
me
i
could
get
rid
of
it
along
with
much
moral
and
mental
virtue
unfortunately
possibly
at
the
runnymede
or
failing
that
at
the
place
where
the
lachlan
had
been
stiff
little
breeze
we
had
i
remarked
as
i
sat
down
to
supper
well
no
replied
jack
in
reluctant
and
compassionate
negative
and
this
was
the
only
part
of
his
long
reply
fit
to
place
before
the
sanctimonious
reader
he
went
on
to
tell
me
in
the
vulgar
tongue
that
if
i
had
ever
been
at
sea
i
would
think
nothing
of
a
whiff
like
that
he
told
me
of
storms
he
had
weathered
particularly
one
off
christiana
cooner
a
solitary
island
in
the
south
atlantic
and
the
effect
of
his
discourse
is
that
i
have
ever
since
been
careful
in
the
company
of
sailors
to
avoid
speaking
of
the
winds
i
have
encountered
i
fix
you
up
for
a
hat
he
continued
in
language
of
matchless
force
and
piquancy
bend
her
she
about
fit
you
i
dropped
across
her
one
day
i
was
in
the
was
a
drab
belltopper
in
perfect
preservation
with
a
crown
nothing
less
than
a
foot
and
a
half
high
and
a
narrow
wavy
brim
she
proved
a
perfect
fit
when
i
her
i
wore
her
afterward
for
many
a
week
till
one
night
she
rolled
away
from
my
camp
and
i
saw
her
no
more
though
i
sought
her
diligently
take
her
for
all
in
all
i
shall
not
look
upon
her
like
again
now
if
you
a

skylights

you
be
set
up
for
a
professor
of
phrenology
or
doxology
or
any
other
ology
suggested
jack
with
one
oath
two
unseemly
expletives
and
two
obscenities
how
is
that
for
high
i
asked
putting
on
a
pair
of
large
round
clouded
lenses
which
my
experience
of
ophthalmia
has
warned
me
to
carry
continually
then
without
interrupting
my
good
host
torrent
of
unrepeatable
congratulation
i
turned
aside
and
unstrapped
a
portion
of
bunyip
pack
presently
i
advanced
and
resumed
my
seat
with
the
ancestor
of
all
pipes
pendent
from
my
mouth
the
hat
glasses
and
pipe
chorded
if
i
may
use
that
expression
so
perfectly
that
jack
merriment
in
a
reverent
petition
to
be
struck
dead
the
pipe
has
already
been
in
these
annals
it
was
probably
the
most
artistic
the
most
the
most
scholarly
the
most
imposing
and
from
a
darwinian
point
of
view
the
most
highly
specialised
meerschaum
ever
seen
on
earth
it
was
a
pipe
such
as
no
smoker
parts
with
during
life
but
bequeaths
to
his
son
a
pipe
such
as
would
make
any
man
wish
to
have
a
benjamin
but
for
the
fear
that
the
might
be
exposed
to
unfair
temptation
and
the
old
man
himself
to
grave
peril
this
nonpareil
lies
before
me
now
on
an
old
cracked
with
my
knife
and
tobacco
its
head
ideally
perfect
as
that
goddess
who
rose
from
similar
material
carries
in
spite
of
its
vast
size
no
suggestion
of
the
colossal
but
rather
of
the
majestic
its
aspect
would
be
overpowering
but
for
the
soothing
and
reassuring
effect
of
colour
as
where
at
point
of
contact
the
opaque
snow
of
the
upper
half
with
edge
overlies
rather
than
meets
the
indescribable
wealth
of
lucent
and
fathomless
umber
which
colour
intensifies
toward
the
rounded
heel
softening
to
a
paler
tint
in
its
serene
till
the
meerschaum
terminates
in
a
heavy
collar
of
almost
audacious
simplicity
then
a
thick
flexible
stem
takes
up
the
wondrous
tale
in
its
turn
extending
with
a
most
magnanimous
restraint
barely
four
inches
ere
transferring
its
glories
to
the
worthy
keeping
of
such
a
piece
of
baltic
amber
as
you
shall
not
match
in
any
democratic
community
the
slight
silver
mounting
hints
a
princely
concession
to
the
great
pipe
family
and
the
two
little
red
crackers
depending
from
the
junction
of
mouthpiece
and
stem
whilst
giving
no
encouragement
to
presumptuous
rivalry
soften
the
austere
unapproachable
perfection
of
the
whole
ongsomble
here
it
occurs
to
the
subtle
critic
that
this
is
something
like
what
a
novelist
would
write
a
novelist
is
always
able
to
bring
forth
out
of
his
imagination
the
very
thing
required
by
the
exigencies
of
his
story
just
as
he
unmasks
the
villian
at
the
critical
moment
and
for
the
young
hero
benefit
gently
shifts
the
amiable
old
potterer
to
a
better
land
in
the
very
nick
of
time
such
is
not
life
and
to
avoid
any
shadow
of
the
imputation
in
which
that
novelist
wallows
i
must
now
turn
aside
for
one
moment
to
tell
how
i
came
into
possession
of
such
a
pipe
as
no
other
australian
bushman
ever
owned
as
for
the
digression
well
i
suppose
even
the
most
insubordinate
reader
is
by
this
time
educated
up
to
my
style
shortly
before
the
previous
i
had
found
myself
on
a
rather
chilly
night
drawing
toward
the
western
boundary
of
gunbah
on
the
track
from
hillston
to
hay
a
spark
of
red
fire
miles
ahead
told
of
someone
camped
at
a
clump
on
illilliwa
just
about
the
spot
i
had
marked
out
as
my
own
destination
there
being
grass
anywhere
inside
the
boundary
of
illilliwa
and
none
in
the
of
gunbah
as
i
drew
nearer
the
impotent
tinkle
of
one
of
those
hemispherical
indicated
a
camp
i
casually
noticed
a
man
sitting
before
the
fire
though
he
vanished
before
i
arrived
leaving
an
empty
as
i
unsaddled
my
horses
he
reappeared
out
of
the
darkness
a
large
blonde
young
fellow
with
a
light
rifle
in
the
hollow
of
his
arm
being
too
hungry
for
conversation
i
merely
tendered
about
three
words
of
civil
remark
whilst
raking
out
some
coals
for
my
and
he
resumed
his
seat
in
silence
watching
me
across
the
fire
but
during
my
ample
repast
the
second
one
of
the
day
i
introduced
myself
more
fully
and
partly
won
my
way
through
the
suspicious
reserve
of
the
strong
man
armed
by
the
time
my
was
and
i
was
stretched
in
aboriginal
contentment
beside
the
fire
i
had
noticed
by
the
uncertain
light
an
tent
which
seemed
to
contain
two
on
one
of
which
lay
a
sleeping
man
some
yards
behind
the
tent
stood
a
my
new
acquaintance
becoming
quite
frank
and
cordial
supported
his
end
of
the
conversation
in
rather
laboured
english
with
a
slight
foreign
accent
was
the
topic
which
had
risen
to
the
surface
and
as
an
hour
two
hours
passed
i
was
fairly
abashed
by
the
extent
and
accuracy
of
his
information
he
talked
so
confidently
so
scientifically
and
as
far
as
my
knowledge
went
so
veraciously
not
only
of
the
principal
australian
but
of
the
different
notable
claims
that
curiosity
broke
through
ceremony
and
i
asked
him
how
long
he
had
been
out
just
three
weeks
he
told
me
his
name
he
added
with
an
inimitable
bow
was
franz
von
swammerbrunck
very
much
at
my
service
his
friend
schloss
and
himself
had
left
frankfort
only
three
months
before
or
i
asked
veiling
a
mild
and
inoffensive
pedantry
under
the
guise
of
friendly
interest
his
courteous
reply
naturally
into
such
a
volume
of
condensed
information
as
on
my
mind
a
fact
which
we
are
perhaps
too
prone
to
lose
sight
of
namely
the
existence
of
a
civilisation
north
of
torres
straits
desiring
of
course
to
avail
myself
of
some
few
rays
of
this
boreal
light
i
tried
to
steer
the
conversation
in
the
direction
of
bainting
and
boetry
for
such
subjects
go
well
at
but
franz
hung
so
persistently
on
one
rein
that
i
had
to
give
him
his
head
and
he
edged
back
to
turn
the
discourse
whatever
way
i
would
that
wearisome
topic
was
adroitly
made
to
occur
as
if
of
its
own
accord

he
entered
the
tent
and
spoke
to
the
sleeper
with
suppressed
eagerness
in
his
voice
the
watch
below
attired
himself
and
came
forth
then
followed
a
formal
introduction
and
in
another
couple
of
hours
such
was
the
clearness
and
receptivity
of
these
young
men
minds
i
had
made
them
acquainted
with
all
i
knew
of
the
geology
of
upper
riverina
and
not
less
remarkable
than
their
infatuation
for
reefs
was
their
vivid
interest
in
bushrangers
and
blackfellows
but
whereas
they
received
my
crude
geological
information
with
the
attention
which
its
frankness
certainly
merited
it
was
plain
that
their
idea
of
prospecting
the
with
the
pick
in
one
hand
and
the
rifle
in
the
other
remained
unshaken
by
my
repeated
assurances
of
peace
and
safety
that
was
all
right
the
topography
of
the
wilderness
was
the
thing
they
wanted
they
would
manage
the
peace
and
safety
for
themselves
schloss
in
particular
was
almost
as
eager
for
the
inevitable
brush
with
outlaw
or
savage
as
he
was
for
the
no
less
inevitable
golden
reef
in
due
time
the
stars
paled
to
indistinctness
then
to
invisibility
and
the
landscape
came
into
view
in
the
fresh
chilly
dawn
showing
a
strong
grey
horse
feeding
with
fancy
and
bunyip
two
hundred
yards
away
i
was
in
no
hurry
to
start
but
my
friends
were
like
greyhounds
in
the
leash
therefore
whilst
i
dozed
off
to
sleep
they
packed
up
their
elaborate
camp
and
harnessed
their
horse
in
the
they
would
stop
for
breakfast
after
a
few
hours
travelling
meantime
they
had
a
cup
of
coffee
i
roused
myself
to
reiterate
the
directions
i
had
already
given
respecting
the
locality
of
half
a
dozen
reefs
in
the
then
my
friends
stowed
away
their
maps
and
diagrams
and
shook
hands
with
me
so
affectionately
so
germanly
in
fact
that
i
called
up
a
certain
sardonic
expression
of
face
as
the
best
safeguard
against
possible
kissing
finally
when
they
were
seated
side
by
side
under
the
tilt
of
the

i
promised
to

the
message
whereupon
the
wise
men
of
the
north
laughed
heartily
then
the
three
of
us
raised
our
hats
with
aristocratic
gravity
and
the
vehicle
moved
away
toward
the
land
of
disillusionment
as
i
lay
down
again
i
heard
the
poor
fellows
burst
into
unintelligible
song
and
after
the
had
jogged
a
quarter
of
a
mile
one
of
the
adventurers
looked
past
the
edge
of
the
tilt
toward
me
and
waved
his
handkerchief
not
having
any
similar
article
on
me
at
the
time
i
and
returned
the
farewell
with
my
hat
as
big
fools
as
ever
between
asleep
and
awake
i
pondered
on
the
quantity
and
quality
of
lore
which
had
found
utterance
there
the
outlawed
bushrangers
the
lurking
blackfellows
the
squatter
lovely
awaiting
the
greenhorn
for
even
she
had
in
conversation
how
these
things
recalled
my
reading
and
yet
they
were
quite
as
reasonable
as
the
discovery
of
the
rich
reef
by
the
fastidious
young
i
had
only
wasted
time
in
asseverating
that
barren
reefs
are
twice
as
plentiful
as
reefs
ten
times
as
plentiful
as
wages
reefs
and
a
hundred
times
as
plentiful
as
pile
reefs
both
margraves
had
listened
with
polite
toleration
when
i
compassionately
added
that
the
pile
reef
is
always
discovered
by
an
ungrammatical
person
named
old
brummy
or
sydney
bob
or
pete
or
something
to
the
same
general
effect
and
this
because
few
can
stoop
low
enough
and
long
enough
and
doggedly
enough
to
conquer
whereas
brummy
does
require
to
stoop
at
all
and
his
show
is
little
better
than
buckley
also
the
barons
had
derived
keen
enjoyment
from
my
honest
suggestion
that
the
best
show
is
to
discover
the
discoverer
and
prevail
upon
the
latter
per
medium
of
and
blarney
to
affix
his
illegible
signature
to
some
expropriating
document
and
yet
those
visionaries
were
highly
informed
men
at
least
as
far
as
schools
lecturerooms
laboratories
museums
and
the
whole
admirable
machinery
of
modern
academic
and
technical
training
could
take
them
this
let
me
add
is
the
record
of
an
actual
occurrence
it
will
just
show
you
how
much
the
novelist
has
to
answer
for
following
as
he
does
the
devices
and
desires
of
his
own
heart
telling
the
lies
he
ought
not
to
have
told
and
leaving
untold
the
lies
that
he
ought
to
have
told
i
am
not
forgetting
the
pipe
leaving
the
camp
at
about
ten
in
the
forenoon
i
noticed
lying
among
the
tussocks
where
the
had
stood
something
which
at
the
first
glance
i
took
for
the
sumptuous
holster
of
an
overgrown
navy
revolver
i
need
say
no
more
it
may
have
been
the
landgraves
or
on
the
other
hand
it
may
not
at
all
events
regarding
the
article
as
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
i
formally
took
possession
under
hen
sec
holding
myself
prepared
at
any
time
to
surrender
the
property
to
anyone
clever
enough
to
sneak
it
and
cunning
enough
to
keep
it
though
a
sense
of
delicacy
might
prevent
me
chasing
the
kronprinzes
round
the
country
as
if
they
had
stolen
something
when
the
pipe
had
eaten
its
magnificent
head
off
in
tobacco
then
of
course
i
sold
it
to
pay
expenses
and
bought
it
in
myself
so
i
have
it
still
and
if
the
censorious
reader
has
detected
here
and
there
in
these
pages
a
tendency
toward
the
higher
criticism
or
a
leaning
to
state
socialism
or
any
passage
that
seemed
to
indicate
a
familiarity
with
cuneiform
inscriptions
or
with
the
history
and
habits
of
man
he
may
be
assured
that
at
the
time
of
writing
such
passage
i
had
been
smoking
the
mighty
pipe
or
rather
the
mighty
pipe
had
been
smoking
me
and
the
unlawful
erudition
had
effervesced
per
motion
of
my
scholastic
ally

better

yet

had
persuaded
him
to
give
them
a
couple
or
three
songs
before
he
left
was
he
something
wonderful
i
remarked
well
no
jack
replied
deferentially
but
positively
nothing
like
what
you
hear
in
a
in
fact
according
to
jack
account
he
used
to
be
reputed
a
middling
singer
himself
and
he
straightway
rendered
a
mawkishly
sentimental
song
and
a
couple
of
extremely
unchaste
ones
in
a
voice
which
made
the
pannikins
on
the
table
rattle
in
sympathy
i
remembered
alf
minstrelsy
and
the
contrast
was
painful
jack
noticed
a
depression
creeping
over
me
and
with
the
intuition
of
true
hospitality
exerted
his
conversational
powers
for
my
entertainment
his
discourse
ran
exclusively
on
a
topic
which
sad
to
say
furnishes
in
all
grades
of
masculine
society
the
motif
of
nearly
every
joke
worth
telling
in
this
line
jack
was
a
discriminating
anthologist
and
moreover
a
judicious
adapter
all
his
gestes
being
related
in
the
his
autobiographical
record
was
a
staggerer
but
i
happened
to
recognise
amongst
his
affaires
de
coeur
several
very
old
acquaintances
and
made
allowance
accordingly
if
he
had
been
a
truthful
man
the
floor
of
the
hut
would
have
opened
that
night
and
swallowed
him
alive
but
his
emulation
of
paul
hyperbole
covered
as
with
a
mantle
his
multitude
of
transgressions
and
preserved
him
for
better
things
yes
better
things
for
mind
you
beyond
this
rollicking
blackguard
there
stood
a
second
jack
a
chivalrous
to
quixotism
yet
provokingly
reticent
touching
any
act
or
sentiment
which
reflected
real
credit
on
himself
not
that
every
blackguard
is
a
bayard
any
more
than
every
is
a
coward
but
almost
all
moral
and
immoral
qualities
are
in
reality
independent
of
each
other
and
jack
for
one
thing
was
eminently
religious
as
indeed
were
those
greater
geniuses
and
equally
hard
cases
dick
steele
and
henry
fielding
says
the
first
lord
neither
of
the
admiralty
nor
the
treasury
web
of
our
life
is
of
a
mingled
yarn
good
and
ill
together
our
virtues
would
be
proud
if
our
faults
whipped
them
not
and
our
crimes
would
despair
if
they
were
not
cherished
by
our
virtues
i
always
make
a
bit
of
a
prayer
before
remarked
jack
in
appendix
to
a
story
which
chaucer
or
boccaccio
would
have
rejected
with
horror
then
the
poor
fellow
laid
his
pipe
on
the
table
and
kneeling
by
his
bedside
repeated
in
a
firm
reverent
voice
an
almost
unrecognisable
version
of
the
lord
prayer
and
an
unconscious
parody
on
evening
hymn
to
thee
my
god
this
night
see
it
this
way
with
me
he
continued
rising
from
his
knees
and
his
pipe
las
time
i
seen
my
pore
mother
she
was
for
my
ole
man
he
shipped
o
the
raglan
las
time
she
weighed
says
the
ole
woman
to
me
an
the
tears
rollin
down
her
face
be
goin
on
five
year
ago
now
says
she
me
you
always
make
a
bit
of
a
prayer
before
for
the
lord
says
anybody
that
ashamed
o
him
he
be
ashamed
o
him
at
the
day
o
judgment
awful
ai
it
course
i
promised
but
it
went
in
o
one
ear
an
out
o
the
other
till
about
two
year
after
when
i
got
word
she
was
dead
i
was
on
runnymede
then
for
i
come
straight
here
when
i
bolted
from
the
ship
an
i
begun
to
bethink
myself
that
she
could
see
how
i
was
keepin
my
promise
so
i
an
laid
a
bit
closer
lord
knows
i
gev
her
worry
enough
while
she
was
alive
without
follerin
her
up
any
furder
i
have
taken
some
trouble
in
weeding
the
language
of
jack
confession
so
as
not
to
destroy
its
consecutiveness
and
in
the
worthy
fellow
mind
with
this
childlike
simplicity
was
a
really
fine
store
of
the
best
kind
of
knowledge
namely
that
acquired
from
observation
and
experience
it
is
surprising
how
much
a
landsman
however
may
gather
from
a
sailor
when
he
listens
like
a
child
and
the
mariner
hath
his
will
i
only
wish
i
was
as
well
posted
up
in
stingarees
krakens
and
other
marine
commonplaces
as
i
am
thanks
to
jack
information
in
the
hawk
and
the
penguin
it
came
about
in
this
way
the
door
was
left
open
for
ventilation
when
we
retired
to
rest
jack
in
his
bunk
and
i
on
the
floor
we
were
both
asleep
when
i
became
aware
of
an
icy
touch
on
my
face
accompanied
by
a
breath
strongly
suggesting
to
my
scientific
nose
the
of
dead
bullock
drowsily
opening
one
eye
i
saw
pup
standing
by
my
side
he
had
thought
i
was
dead
but
finding
his
mistake
he
walked
away
through
the
gloom
with
an
injured
and
dissatisfied
air
and
began
trying
to
root
the
lid
off
jack
with
his
pointed
nose
one
peculiarity
of
the
is
that
though
he
has
no
faculty
of
scent
at
the
service
of
his
master
he
can
smell
food
through
boilerplate
and
he
rivals
trenck
or
monte
cristo
in
making
way
through
any
obstacle
which
may
stand
between
him
and
the
object
of
his
desires
the
clattering
of
the
roused
jack
he
looked
up
and
then
left
his
bed
pore
creature
hungry
is
near
enough
what
he
said
he
opened
a
sort
of
safe
and
took
out
all
the
cooked
mutton
which
he
divided
into
two
unequal
portions
then
gave
the
smaller
share
to
his
own
dog
and
the
larger
to
pup
bit
evener
on
your
keel
after
you
stowed
that
in
your
hold
he
soliloquised
profanely
jack
said
i
would
you
just
see
that
everything
safe
from
him
before
you
again
there
always
a
siege
of
jerusalem
going
on
in
his
inside
the
the
hungriest
subject
in
the
animal
kingdom
well
no
replied
jack
forbearingly
as
he
returned
to
his
bed
he
ai
in
it
with
the
hawk
that
the
hungriest
subject
goin
though
strictly
speakin
he
do
belong
to
no
kingdom
in
particular
he
belongs
to
the
high
seas
if
you
had
a
chance
to
study
hawks
like
i
had
you
never
think
a
was
half
hungry
why
he
dunno
what
proper
hunger
is
then
he
gave
me
such
a
description
of
this
afflicted
bird
as
in
the
interests
of
science
i
have
great
pleasure
in
laying
before
the
intelligent
public
i
must
however
use
my
own
language
jack
rhetoric
though
lucid
and
forcible
would
look
so
bad
on
paper
that
the
police
might
interfere
with
its
publication
the
hawk
it
appears
utters
a
thrilling
squeal
of
hunger
the
moment
his
beak
emerges
from
the
shell
and
this
hunger
dogs
him
him
you
might
say
through
life
at
adult
age
he
consists
chiefly
of
wings
but
in
addition
to
these
he
has
a
pair
of
eager
sleepless
eyes
endowed
with
a
power
of
something
like
diameters
and
he
has
also
a
perennially
empty
stomach
the
sort
of
vacuum
by
the
way
which
nature
particularly
abhors
he
can
eat
nothing
but
fish
and
since
he
suffers
under
the
disadvantage
of
being
unable
to
dive
wade
or
swim
some
one
else
must
catch
the
fish
for
him
the
penguin
does
this
and
does
it
with
a
listless
ease
which
would
excite
the
envy
of
the
hawk
if
the
unceasing
anguish
of
hunger
allowed
the
latter
any
respite
for
thought
the
penguin
also
lives
on
fish
but
there
the
resemblance
happily
ends
in
every
other
respect
he
presents
a
pointed
antithesis
to
the
hawk
and
that
is
the
only
pointed
thing
about
him
for
he
consists
wholly
of
a
comfortable
body
a
blunt
neb
and
a
pair
of
small
sleepy
eyes
he
has
no
neck
for
he
never
requires
to
look
round
no
wings
for
he
never
requires
to
fly
no
feet
for
he
stands
firmly
on
one
end
like
a
bag
of
flour
which
indeed
he
closely
resembles
his
life
is
unadventurous
some
might
call
it
monotonous
he
takes
his
position
on
a
smooth
rock
protected
from
cold
by
the
beautiful
padded
surtout
which
clothes
him
from
neb
to
base
and
from
heat
by
the
cool
limpid
wave
softly
against
the
impenetrable
feathers
he
feels
like
a
stove
in
the
winter
and
like
a
in
the
summer
when
from
a
sort
of
drowsy
felicitous
wantonness
for
he
never
requires
to
act
either
on
reason
or
impulse
he
desires
to
visit
an
adjacent
island
he
simply
allows
the
tide
to
encircle
him
to
about
his
total
altitude
then
by
the
floatative
property
of
his
peerless
physique
and
by
the
mere
volition
of
will
he
transports
himself
whither
he
lists
he
has
few
wants
and
no
ambition
dreaming
the
happy
hours
away
that
is
his
idea
he
knows
barely
enough
to
be
aware
that
with
much
wisdom
cometh
much
sorrow
therefore
no
pierian
spring
no
tree
of
knowledge
thank
you
all
the
same
he
is
right
enough
as
he
is
the
perpetual
sabbath
of
absolute
negation
is
good
enough
for
him
his
motto
is
the
bird
that
has
no
history
once
a
day
he
experiences
a
crisp
triumphant
appetite
which
differs
from
hunger
as
melody
differs
from
discord
then
he
slowly
his
eyes
and
selects
from
the
finny
multitudes
swimming
around
him
such
a
fish
as
for
size
flavour
and
general
applicability
will
best
administer
to
his
bodily
requirements
and
gratify
his
epicurean
taste
whilst
he
is
in
the
act
of
dipping
his
neb
in
the
water
to
help
himself
to
the
fish
a
hawk
espies
him
from
a
distance
of
say
five
miles
emitting
a
quivering
shriek
of
hunger
the
sufferer
cleaves
the
intervening
air
with
the
speed
of
a
telegram
and
has
siezed
and
swallowed
the
fish
before
his
own
belated
shriek
arrives
the
penguin
living
in
total
ignorance
of
the
hawk
existence
vaguely
and
apprehends
his
deprivation
in
this
way
you
have
heard
the
girl
rap
at
your
bedroom
door
and
tell
you
that
breakfast
is
on
the
table
you
have
thought
to
yourself
now
i
turning
out
now
i
putting
on
my
now
my
socks
now
why
i
in
bed
still
and
no
nearer
breakfast
than
at
first
here
we
have
a
reproduction
of
the
penguin
train
of
thought
plus
the
slight
shock
of
surprise
which
marks
your
own
relatively
imperfect
organisation
the
whole
thing
does
amount
to
a
crumpled
beneath
the
penguin
base
so
he
apathetically
depresses
his
dreamy
eyes
in
casual
quest
of
another
fish
now
if
the
feathered
martyr
could
only
wait
one
minute
he
might
obtain
the
second
morsel
on
the
same
terms
as
the
first
but
nature
has
so
constructed
him
that
in
his
estimation
the
most
important
of
all
economies
is
the
economy
of
time
and
his
dollond
eye
has
descried
another
penguin
seven
miles
distant
in
the
very
act
of
dipping
for
a
fish
can
he
make
the
return
trip
he
must
chance
it
he
negotiates
with
lightning
speed
the
interspace
between
his
tortured
stomach
and
the
second
penguin
provender
whilst
his
own
screech
of
famine
comes
feebly
halting
after
and
blends
with
the
desolate
plop
of
his
prey
into
the
abysmal
emptiness
of
his
epigastrium
then
wheeling
madly
round
his
connemara
complaint
freshly
whetted
by
what
he
has
taken
he
sees
the
first
penguin
dropping
asleep
as
the
fish
he
has
just
caught
slides
down
to
be
assimilated
by
the
simple
clockwork
of
his
interior
too
late
by
full
fifteen
seconds
and
the
wild
despair
of
lost
opportunity
lends
a
horrid
eeriness
to
the
banshee
utterance
with
which
the
hawk
greets
this
crushing
discovery
barbed
as
it
is
by
the
prior
knowledge
that
every
penguin
within
twenty
miles
is
in
nirvana
for
the
present
now
he
must
wait
ah
heavens
wait
while
one
with
moderate
haste
might
tell
a
hundred
by
that
time
the
bird
beside
him
will
have
caught
another
fish
and
though
it
be
only
by
my
faith
he
must
wait
longer
for
the
penguin
concluding
that
his
own
appetite
will
be
more
finely
matured
by
another
sleep
is
just
dozing
off
woe
for
the
hawk
he
must
decide
on
something
without
delay
and
he
must
do
that
something
quickly
quickly
quickly
for
there
will
be
loafing
enough
in
the
grave
as
the
great
american
moralist
says
but
five
hundred
miles
away
across
the
restless
hungry
waste
of
waters
is
another
rock
where
penguins
steep
themselves
in
sinless
voluptuousness
and
with
one
prolonged
yell
wrung
from
him
by
the
torment
of
his
fell
disease
the
unhappy
bird
expands
his
pinions
and
with
the
speed
of
a
comet
passing
its
perihelion
sweeps
away
to
that
rock
for
like
louis
he
knows
geography
after
listening
with
much
interest
to
the
description
here
loosely
paraphrased
i
fell
asleep
with
the
longing
to
be
a
penguin
and
the
liveliest
gratitude
that
i
was
not
a
hawk
next
morning
whilst
i
caught
and
equipped
my
horses
jack
tailed
his
own
two
into
the
every
runnymede
boundary
man
was
expected
to
find
himself
in
horses
and
jack
on
being
rated
had
purchased
the
two
quietest
and
most
shapeless
mokes
on
the
station
or
indeed
off
it
is
good
in
this
connection
but
in
a
week
or
two
lazy
as
the
mokes
were
jack
could
grapple
either
of
them
stabbard
or
port
in
the
open
paddock
they
had
learned
to
await
and
even
approach
him
so
he
had
to
pelt
them
into
the
little
yard
where
an
ingeniously
devised
adjustable
crush
formed
by
one
barbed
wire
kept
them
till
he
caught
the
one
he
wanted
for
the
day
let
jack
alone
having
caught
one
of
his
mokes
he
caparisoned
the
i
forget
his
own
designation
with
what
in
dearth
of
adequate
superlative
i
shall
simply
call
a
english
saddle
of
more
than
ordinary
capacity
the
f
firewood
which
had
once
formed
the
tree
was
all
in
splinters
so
that
you
could
fold
the
saddle
in
any
direction
and
the
panel
had
from
time
to
time
been
subjected
to
so
much
amateur
repairing
that
when
jack
mounted
he
looked
like
a
hen
in
a
nest
so
surrounded
he
was
with
exuding
tufts
of
wool
raw
emus
feathers
and
the
frayed
edges
of
half
a
dozen
plies
of
old
blanket
of
various
colours
but
when
he
said
it
was
the
softest
saddle
on
the
station
though
it
would
be
nothing
the
worse
for
a
bit
of
an
overhaul
i
was
bound
to
admit
that
the
statement
and
the
reservation
were
equally
reasonable
we
journeyed
together
as
far
as
the
western
gate
of
jack
paddock
and
the
conversation
turning
on
saddles
he
expressed
himself
in
actionably
misdemeanant
language
on
the
folly
of
riding
horses
like
cleopatra
and
satan
without
a
purchase
his
idea
of
such
a
purchase
was
simple
enough
merely
the
ordinary
saddle
with
two
standing
bulkheads
of
say
thirty
inches
in
height
by
eighteen
in
width
rigged
thortships
one
forrid
of
the
rider
and
one
aft
and
each
padded
on
the
inside
surface
a
couple
or
three
rove
on
each
side
would
prevent
the
rider
listing
to
stabbard
or
port
while
the
vertical
pitch
would
be
provided
for
by
a
lashing
rove
across
each
shoulder
if
the
horse
reared
and
fell
back
you
would
just
draw
your
head
in
like
a
turtle
and
let
the
bulkheads
carry
the
strain
with
such
a
tackle
pr
tayckle
jack
would
undertake
to
ride
the
evil
one
himself
let
alone
his
namesake
at
the
station
whereas
there
was
young
jack
at
work
on
the
horse
for
the
last
week
while
the
horse
aforesaid
knowing
the
purchase
he
had
on
his
rider
would
be
a
fool
to
give
in
but
these
young
colonials
had
nothing
in
them
and
jack
spirit
was
moved
within
him
by
reason
of
their
degeneracy
after
parting
from
this
secret
of
england
greatness
i
detected
a
certain
spontaneous
creeping
over
my
soul
and
slightly
swelling
my
head
a
certain
placid
cockiness
not
to
be
fully
accounted
for
by
the
consciousness
of
birth
which
naturally
broadened
as
i
approached
runnymede
i
thereupon
resolved
myself
into
a
committee
of
inquiry
and
applying
the
analytical
system
befitting
these
introspective
investigations
discovered
in
the
first
place
furtively
underlying
my
philosophy
a
latent
ambition
to
be
regarded
as
a
final
authority
on
things
in
general
hitherto
this
aspiration
had
fallen
short
partly
owing
to
the
clinging
sediment
of
my
congenital
ignorance
but
more
especially
because
i
lacked
and
knew
i
lacked
what
is
known
as
a
now
however
the
high
drab
belltopper
and
long
alpaca
coat
happily
seconded
by
large
round
glasses
and
a
vast
and
scholarly
pipe
seemed
to
get
over
the
latter
and
greater
difficulty
and
for
perhaps
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
enjoyed
that
experience
so
dear
to
some
of
my
the
consciousness
of
being
this
would
naturally
come
as
a
revelation
to
one
who
had
always
been
satisfied
with
any
attire
which
kept
him
out
of
the
hands
of
the
police
there
was
something
in
presenting
an
appearance
even
to
the
sordid
sheep
as
they
looked
up
from
nibbling
their
stumps
and
to
the
frivolous
galahs
sweeping
in
a
cloud
over
the
plain
or
studding
the
trees
of
the
like
large
pink
and
blossoms
set
off
by
the
rich
green
of
the
foliage
but
outside
all
possible
research
or
divination
lay
the
occult
reason
why
my
bosom
lord
sat
so
lightly
on
his
throne
this
will
be
explained
in
its
proper
place
in
the
last
just
after
clearing
the
i
met
young
jack
on
satan
satan
was
an
ornament
to
the
station
a
magnificently
beautiful
horse
with
silver
mane
and
tail
but
unfortunately
spoiled
a
couple
of
years
before
in
the
now
the
shallow
inattentive
reader
may
not
grasp
all
that
is
implied
in
the
remark
that
a
specialist
unconscious
of
his
own
peculiar
and
circumscribed
greatness
and
cheaply
replaceable
in
case
of
extinction
was
exercising
a
seasoned
colt
thoroughly
spoiled
beforehand
your
novelist
availing
himself
of
his
prerogative
fancifully
assigns
this
office
to
the
and
above
all
fresh
from
the
english
rectory
but
i
am
a
mere
annalist
and
a
blunt
stolid
unimaginative
one
at
that
therefore
not
entirely
lost
to
all
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
listen
then
when
after
an
assiduous
and
inglorious
apprenticeship
you
can
wheel
a
galloping
horse
round
in
his
own
length
without
paraboling
over
his
head
or
turning
him
upside
down
when
you
can
take
him
safely
across
any
leap
he
is
able
to
clear
when
you
can
send
him
at
his
uttermost
with
perfect
safety
through
forest
or
scrub
you
are
scarcely
one
step
nearer
to
the
successful
riding
of
an
equine
artist
that
has
sworn
to
get
you
off
or
perish
scarcely
one
step
nearer
than
you
were
at
first
unless
you
constitutionally
possess
certain
qualifications
and
are
at
the
same
time
distinguished
by
a
plentiful
lack
of
other
gifts
and
acquirements
for
which
notwithstanding
you
are
fain
to
take
credit
this
rather
obscure
apostrophe
is
written
expressly
for
the
benefit
of
such
imaginative
litterateurs
and
conversational
liars
as
it
may
concern
for
it
should
be
known
that
the
perfect
rider
non
fit
to
begin
with
that
his
training
must
begin
in
early
boyhood
and
be
followed
up
sans
intermission
that
his
system
of
must
be
the
which
is
beyond
doubt
the
most
trying
in
the
world
that
his
skill
is
won
by
grassers
innumerable
that
in
short
there
is
no
royal
road
to
the
riding
of
a
proper
outlaw
a
horse
that
not
with
any
view
of
before
girls
but
with
the
confirmed
intention
of
flattening
out
his
antagonist
plays
such
fantastic
jigs
before
high
heaven
as
make
the
angels
peep
and
yet
to
be
an
ideal
rider
man
wants
but
little
here
below
nor
is
it
at
all
likely
he
will
want
that
little
long
he
wants
or
rather
needs
a
skull
of
best
spring
steel
a
spinal
column
of
standard
lowmoor
limbs
of
a
hide
of
vulcanised
and
the
less
brains
he
has
the
better
figuratively
speaking
he
should
have
no
brains
at
all
his
thinking
faculties
should
be
so
placed
as
to
be
in
direct
touch
with
the
only
thing
that
concerns
him
namely
the
saddle
yet
his
heart
must
not
be
there
he
must
by
no
means
be
what
the
schoolboys
call
a
beggar
perfect
horsemanship
is
usually
the
special
accomplishment
of
the
man
who
is
not
otherwise
worth
his
salt
by
reason
of
being
too
lazy
for
manual
labour
and
too
slenderly
upholstered
on
the
mental
side
for
anything
else
sir
francis
head
one
of
the
five
exceptions
to
this
rule
gordon
being
the
second
the
third
the
fourth
and
the
demurring
reader
the
fifth
says
the
greatest
art
in
riding
is
knowing
how
to
fall
and
here
we
touch
the
very
root
of
the
matter
it
is
the
moral
effect
of
that
apprehension
which
makes
one
salient
difference
between
the
cultivated
or
spurious
rider
and
the
ignorant
or
true
rider
in
this
case
ignorance
is
not
only
bliss
but
usurps
the
place
of
knowledge
as
power
edward
curr
knew
as
much
of
the
australian
horse
and
his
rider
as
any
writer
ever
did
and
this
is
what
he
says
of
the
natives
are
taciturn
shy
ignorant
and
incurious
undemonstrative
but
orderly
hospitable
courageous
cool
and
sensible
these
men
ride
like
centaurs
etc
yes
yes
but
why
looking
back
along
that
string
of
adjectives
does
your
own
inductive
faculty
at
once
place
its
finger
on
ignorance
as
the
key
to
the
enigma
notice
too
how
curr
being
a
bit
of
a
sticker
himself
is
thereby
disqualified
from
knowing
that
the
centaurs
were
better
constructed
for
firing
other
people
over
their
heads
than
for
straddling
their
own
backs
your
must
audibly
and
sanguineously
challenge
every
unfamiliar
scientific
fact
stated
in
conversation
and
be
prepared
to
stake
his
rudimentary
soul
on
the
truth
of
anything
read
aloud
from
a
book
he
must
believe
with
the
ecclesiastics
of
yesterday
that
the
earth
is
flat
and
square
like
them
he
must
be
a
violent
supporter
of
the
geocentric
theory
unlike
them
his
aeschatological
hypothesis
must
be
that
the
fire
we
wot
of
is
only
a
man
own
conscience
the
wish
in
his
case
being
father
to
the
thought
above
all
he
must
have
no
idea
how
fearfully
and
wonderfully
he
is
made
he
must
think
upon
himself
as
a
good
strong
framework
of
bones
cushioned
and
buffered
with
meat
and
partly
tubular
for
the
reception
and
retention
of
food
he
must
further
regard
it
as
a
rather
grave
oversight
in
his
own
architectural
design
that
the
calf
of
his
leg
is
riot
in
front
just
consider
what
advantages
such
a
man
enjoys
in
cultivating
the
art
of
knowing
how
to
fall
why
a
spill
that
perils
neck
or
limb
a
simple
buster
is
to
him
and
it
is
nothing
more
but
it
is
a
great
deal
more
to
one
who
has
been
nourishing
a
youth
sublime
with
the
curious
facts
of
science
and
the
items
of
general
information
necessary
to
any
person
who
like
the
fantastical
duke
of
dark
corners
above
all
other
strifes
contends
especially
to
know
himself
and
that
physically
as
well
as
morally
to
him
it
is
a
nasty
scrunch
of
the
two
hundred
and
bones
forming
his
own
admirably
designed
osseous
structure
a
dull
sickening
wallop
of
his
exquisitely
composed
cellular
muscular
and
nervous
tissues
a
general
squash
of
his
beautifully
mapped
vascular
system
a
pitiless
stoush
of
membranes
ligaments
cartilages
and
what
not
a
beastly
squelch
of
gastric
and
pancreatic
juices
and
secretions
of
all
imaginable
descriptions
biliary
glandular
and
so
forth
and
all
for
what
why
for
the
sake
of
emulating
the
jack
frosts
of
real
life
in
their
own
line
my
contention
simply
is
that
the
is
only
too
well
seized
of
the
important
fact
that
his
bones
cost
too
much
in
the
breeding
to
play
at
with
them
and
i
further
maintain
that
for
reasons
above
specified
the
man
of
large
discourse
looking
before
an
after
ah
that
is
where
the
mischief
lies
never
in
spite
of
his
severest
knows
what
a
frightened
beggar
he
is
till
he
finds
himself
placing
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
preparatory
to
mounting
a
recognised
performer
just
take
yourself
as
an
example
you
remember
the
time
you
were
passing
the
old
in
the
flat
and
saw
four
fellows
of
your
acquaintance
putting
the
bridle
on
a
black
colt
in
the
crush
you
remember
how
the
chaps
inspected
your
saddle
and
the
concurrence
of
opinion
being
that
it
was
the
best
on
the
ground
how
they
asked
the
loan
of
it
for
an
hour
you
lent
it
with
pleasure
you
will
remember
and
assisted
them
to
girth
it
on
you
liked
to
be
at
the
second
backing
of
a
colt
not
as
the
central
figure
of
course
but
in
the
capacity
of
critic
and
adviser
there
was
the
probability
of
some
decent
riding
also
the
probability
of
a
catastrophe
you
may
perhaps
further
remember
that
whilst
the
ceremony
of
saddling
was
in
progress
you
casually
related
one
of
your
most
ornate
and
unassailable
anecdotes
how
with
that
very
saddle
you
had
once
backed
a
roan
filly
that
on
the
preceding
day
had
broken
a
circus
man
for
reasons
of
your
own
you
located
the
performance
a
hundred
miles
away
and
for
proof
you
pointed
to
the
saddle
itself
yes
i
see
you
remember
it
all
like
yesterday
the
colt
with
a
handkerchief
across
his
eyes
was
led
out
of
the
yard
to
some
nice
level
ground
then
a
supervened
the
chap
who
had
backed
him
on
the
previous
evening
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
was
to
have
ridden
him
again
did
like
the
set
of
your
saddle
now
that
he
saw
it
the
owner
of
the
colt
speaking
for
himself
frankly
admitted
that
he
never
pretended
to
be
a
sticker
the
third
fellow
whilst
modestly
glancing
at
his
own
unrivalled
record
regretted
he
was
sworn
with
a
against
backing
colts
for
the
current
year
the
fourth
was
also
out
of
it
owing
to
a
boil
which
kept
him
standing
in
the
stirrups
even
on
his
own
old
crock
he
was
compelled
to
forego
the
one
transcendant
joy
of
his
life
but
you
well
to
begin
with
there
was
your
own
saddle
on
the
colt
secondly
your
conversation
had
not
been
that
of
a
man
who
did
pretend
to
be
a
sticker
thirdly
the
expedient
was
simply
out
of
the
question
and
fourthly
it
was
too
late
in
the
day
to
allege
a
boil
what
was
the
use
of
your
remarking
that
the
first
backing
of
a
colt
is
nothing
that
in
this
case
it
is
the
second
step
that
costs
the
four
fellows
knew
as
well
as
you
did
everyone
except
the
tenderfoot
novelist
knows
that
in
nearly
every
instance
a
freshly
backed
colt
is
like
a
fish
out
of
water
stupid
puzzled
it
is
at
the
second
backing
that
he
is
ready
to
contest
the
question
of
fitness
for
survival
he
has
had
time
to
think
the
matter
over
and
to
note
the
of
the
alliance
again
there
is
a
large
difference
between
riding
a
colt
upon
a
warm
evening
and
doing
the
same
thing
on
a
cold
dry
gusty
morning
when
his
hair
inclines
to
stand
on
end
but
there
was
your
own
reminiscence
of
the
roan
filly
staring
you
in
the
face
one
of
the
fellows
holds
the
blindfolded
colt
whilst
another
rubs
the
saddle
all
over
with
a
wet
handkerchief
the
colt
stands
still
and
composed
with
one
ear
warily
cocked
the
other
indifferently
slouched
with
his
back
slightly
arched
and
ah
the
saints
preserve
us
with
his
tail
jammed
hard
down
carelessly
humming
a
little
tune
you
hang
your
coat
on
the
fence
and
in
the
saying
of
two
credos
note
the
appositeness
of
cervantes
expression
here
you
are
in
the
saddle
the
same
saddle
by
the
way
with
which
you
took
the
flashness
out
of
the
roan
filly
that
had
broken
the
circus
man
what
have
i
pinch
you
signior
gremio
the
chap
should
have
let
the
colt
go
at
once
for
in
situations
like
yours
a
person
keeps
as
the
moments
pass
but
no
ready
tom
yes
you
sure
you
ready
yes
i
think
he
buck
middlin
hard
is
there
no
pity
sitting
in
the
clouds
that
looks
into
the
bottom
of
your
woe
we
see
presently
meantime
console
yourself
with
the
recollection
of
the
roan
filly
that
had
broken
the
circus
man
you
got
the
off
stirrup
all
right
tom
yes
i
goin
to
let
the
beggar
rip
go
ahead
look
out
now
right
but
your
voice
is
not
what
it
ought
to
be
and
the
soles
of
your
boots
are
rattling
on
the
flat
part
of
the
the
chap
draws
the
handkerchief
from
the
colt
eyes
and
walks
backward
the
colt
catches
sight
of
your
left
foot
and
skips
three
yards
to
the
right
in
doing
so
he
catches
sight
of
the
other
foot
and
skips
to
the
left
then
everything
disappears
from
in
front
of
the
saddle
the
wicked
ears
now
laid
level
backward
the
black
tangled
mane
the
shining
neck
with
the
sweeping
curve
of
a
circular
saw
the
clean
oblique
shoulders
they
have
all
disappeared
and
there
is
nothing
in
front
of
the
saddle
but
a
precipice
there
is
something
underneath
it
though
how
distinctly
you
note
the
grunting
of
the
colt
the
thumping
of
his
feet
on
the
ground
and
the
gratuitous
counsel
addressed
to
you
in
four
calmly
critical
voices
lean
back
a
bit
more
tom
and
give
with
him
do
ride
so
loose
if
you
can
help
it
tom
hold
yourself
well
down
with
the
reins
and
stick
to
him
tom
stick
to
him
tom
whatever
you
do
ay
stick
to
him
stick
to
the
lever
of
a
steam
hammer
when
the
ram
kicks
the
stick
to
the
rope
when
an
irish
quarryman
named
bamey
has
hold
of
the
other
end
stick
to
him
quotha
easier
said
than
done
is
it
not
and
yet
you
been
riding
all
manner
of
horses
on
and
off
mark
the
significance
of
that
expression
since
you
were
a
mere
kiddie
however
you
have
stuck
to
him
for
a
good
solid
sixty
seconds
now
one
of
your
knees
has
slipped
over
the
pad
and
your
stirrup
is
swinging
loose
good
night
sweet
prince
and
away
circles
the
colt
slapping
at
the
bit
with
his
front
feet
whilst
your
historic
saddle
shines
in
the
sun
and
the
occasionally
meet
high
in
the
air
and
away
in
chase
go
two
of
the
chaps
on
their
bits
of
stuff
meanwhile
you
explain
to
the
other
two
that
the
spill
serves
you
right
for
riding
so
carelessly
and
that
though
your
soul
lusts
to
have
it
out
with
the
colt
a
stringent
appointment
in
the
township
will
force
you
to
clear
as
soon
as
you
can
get
your
saddle
such
is
life
satan
approached
carrying
his
negatively
gifted
rider
at
a
free
flying
canter
his
gregarious
instinct
prompting
him
to
join
my
horses
his
tawny
skin
was
streaked
with
foam
and
his
off
flank
slightly
stained
from
the
repeated
puncture
of
jack
spur
ten
yards
from
where
i
had
pulled
up
he
suddenly
sulked
and
stood
good
morning
jack
well
i
be
dash
did
know
you
from
a
crow
reckoned
some
member
o
parliament
or
bishop
or
somebody
had
bin
swappin
horses
with
you
you
are
comin
out
oh
i
say
nosey
give
me
the
letter
with
the
three
notes
in
it
but
i
could
make
head
or
tail
of
it
about
the
saddle
no
more
could
moriarty
i
explain
all
that
to
you
some
time
how
are
you
getting
on
with
satan
bad
replied
jack
humbly
you
can
easy
enough
steady
him
down
but
then
the
swine
he
wants
a
spell
an
when
he
gits
a
spell
you
jist
got
to
steady
him
down
agen
always
got
some
new
idear
in
his
head
there
hastily
rooting
the
horse
side
with
his
spur
he
goin
to
laydown
an
make
chips
o
the
saddle
up
you
swine
and
lying
backward
he
reached
down
to
grip
the
sensitive
membrane
connecting
the
swine
with
his
body
the
maddened
beast
shot
past
me
like
a
yellow
streak
for
another
ten
yards
then
with
a
flaring
bound
and
a
snort
that
was
between
a
whistle
and
a
shriek
spun
in
the
air
and
alighted
rigidly
on
his
front
feet
his
ears
between
his
knees
and
his
neck
and
back
describing
a
vertical
semicircle
with
the
saddle
and
jack
on
the
centre
of
its
forward
curve
jist
his
style
continued
jack
dejectedly
never
be
worth
a
dash
for
general
i
lost
the
next
word
or
two
for
the
young
fellow
face
was
buried
in
the
mass
of
silver
mane
as
the
horse
reared
rampant
to
the
balancing
point
and
the
next
word
again
was
dislocated
by
a
blow
from
the
crupper
buckle
just
below
the
speaker
an
magomery
wants
a
person
to
make
a
lady
hack
out
o
sich
an
outlawr
as
him
he
continued
in
hopeless
protest
whilst
the
exerted
his
iron
muscles
to
the
utmost
and
the
saddle
creaked
like
a
basket
nummin
good
horse
too
spoiled
with
jist
look
at
that
satan
had
suddenly
gathered
his
lithe
powerful
limbs
and
was
tearing
across
toward
the
adjacent
spinning
round
every
thirty
yards
in
two
or
three
terrific
bucks
i
do
want
to
sawr
his
mouth
shouted
jack
over
his
shoulder
in
polite
apology
i
see
you
agen
away
on
the
evergreen
shore
probably
i
soliloquised
resuming
my
journey
but
turning
in
the
saddle
and
pushing
up
my
glasses
out
of
the
way
i
watched
the
receding
contest
i
saw
jack
wrench
the
horse
aside
from
the
timber
whereupon
the
animal
reared
rather
too
rashly
and
just
saved
himself
from
falling
backward
by
dropping
on
his
quarters
and
flapping
down
on
one
side
when
his
broadside
touched
ground
jack
was
standing
beside
him
and
when
he
leaped
to
his
feet
jack
was
in
the
saddle
exeunt
fighting
toby
with
his
bare
feet
and
brown
face
was
the
only
person
visible
on
the
station
premises
as
i
rode
up
gosh
i
did
know
you
till
i
seen
you
when
you
was
the
red
gate
he
remarked
the
red
gate
was
about
a
mile
and
a
half
distant
i
thought
you
was
somebody
comin
to
buy
the
the
station
magomery
he
buzznackin
roun
the
run
as
usual
he
continued
helping
me
to
unsaddle
butler
he
laid
up
with
the
bung
blight
in
both
eyes
all
the
other
fellers
is
out
bodysark
and
his
grin
deepened
she
all
right
moriarty
of
course
he
loafin
in
the
store
him
now
laughin
fit
to
break
his
neck
at
some
of
his
own
gosh
foolishness
i
shove
your
horses
in
the
paddick
i
say
ai
they
awful
yes
the
season
telling
on
them
now
will
you
look
after
pup
like
a
good
chap
here
his
chain
i
want
to
keep
him
fresh
for
travelling
right
i
do
wish
you
no
harm
collins
but
i
would
mind
if
you
was
in
heaven
you
left
me
that
dog
i
went
across
to
the
store
and
looked
in
moriarty
laughing
suddenly
ceased
as
his
eye
fell
on
me
and
he
respectfully
rose
to
his
feet
wherefore
that
crackling
of
thorns
under
a
pot
i
asked
sternly
as
i
removed
my
belltopper
and
placed
it
on
the
counter
do
you
see
the
spirits
of
the
wise
sitting
in
the
clouds
and
mocking
you
well
i
be
dashed
he
exclaimed
admiringly
you
are
coming
out
in
blossom
now
you
only
want
the
upper
half
of
your
head
shaved
and
you
could
start
a
loan
and
discount
bank
with
a
capital
of
half
a
million
thanks
worthy
peer
i
replied
with
dignity
but
talking
of
finance
i
trust
you
have
forgotten
the
trifle
that
there
is
between
us
and
the
terms
of
our
agreement
i
not
likely
to
forget
take
that
chair
i
got
such
fun
here
he
had
sliced
some
corks
into
flat
discs
into
the
centre
of
each
disc
he
had
stuck
a
slender
piece
of
pine
about
two
inches
in
height
and
spatulated
at
the
upper
end
like
a
paddle
then
to
the
flat
part
of
each
upright
he
had
attached
a
by
means
of
a
touch
of
gum
on
the
insect
back
and
had
placed
in
the
grasp
of
each
fly
a
piece
of
pine
an
inch
long
cut
into
the
shape
of
a
rifle
the
walking
motion
of
the
fly
feet
twirled
and
balanced
the
stick
in
rather
droll
burlesque
of
musketry
drill
and
a
dozen
of
these
disposed
in
open
order
on
the
counter
were
ministering
to
the
young
fool
mirth
just
you
notice
the
gravity
of
the
beggars
he
laughed
not
a
smile
on
them
solemn
as
presbyterians
present
recover
not
a
lazy
bone
in
their
bodies
i
say
collins
a
person
could
make
a
perpetual
motion
with
a
fly
on
a
sort
of
a
treadmill
ah
but
then
it
would
pass
muster
unless
it
went
of
its
own
accord
would
it
perpetual
motion
a
thing
i
been
giving
my
attention
to
lately
you
remember
you
advised
me
to
study
mechanics
well
i
been
thinking
of
arranging
a
clock
so
as
to
wind
itself
up
as
it
went
on
that
one
idea
another
is
a
little
more
complicated
it
a
driving
a
pump
that
throws
a
stream
into
the
race
that
feeds
the
so
that
you
use
the
same
water
over
and
over
again
and
the
whole
concern
the
idea
came
into
my
head
like
an
inspiration
mind
i
telling
you
in
confidence
for
there
a
thousand
notes
hanging
on
to
it
moriarty
said
i
sadly
you
worse
than
ever
try
something
else
you
not
a
born
mechanician
if
i
not
i
like
to
know
who
the
devil
is
replied
the
young
fellow
hotly
possibly
your
own
self
was
my
father
a
foreman
in
one
of
the
largest
in
victoria
in
his
day
i
know
what
the
matter
with
you
jealousy
it
must
be
so
plato
thou
reasonest
well
said
i
hopelessly
but
supposing
you
are
a
born
mechanician
you
have
neither
the
theoretical
nor
the
practical
training
do
you
know
for
instance
the
use
of
the
brass
slide
you
often
see
on
a
carpenter
rule
of
course
i
do
why
i
could
calculate
with
that
slide
before
i
was
ten
years
old
one
to
moriarty
i
should
have
remembered
that
his
abnormal
breadth
across
the
temples
qualified
him
to
do
a
sum
in
his
head
in
ten
seconds
that
i
could
do
on
a
slate
in
ten
hours
nor
for
that
matter
in
ten
years
no
accounts
in
riverina
were
better
kept
than
those
of
runnymede
good
so
far
i
replied
benevolently
but
how
much
do
you
know
of
prismoidal
formulae
or
logarithmic
secants
not
to
speak
of
segmental
ordinates
or
the
cycloidal
calculus
or
even
of
adiabatic
expansion
or
torsional
resistance
or
the
hydrostatic
paradox
or
the
coefficient
of
friction
now
these
things
are
the
very
a
b
c
of
mechanics
as
you
find
to
your
utter
confusion
moriarty
countenance
fell
but
happening
to
glance
at
the
performing
flies
he
laughed
himself
weak
and
empty
just
look
at
the
beggars
he
murmured
wiping
his
eyes
business
first
said
i
how
about
my
scandal
it
going
grand
replied
moriarty
beaming
with
new
pleasure
i
carried
out
your
suggestions
to
the
letter
first
i
took
mooney
and
nelson
into
my
confidence
and
we
arranged
to
meet
accidentally
one
evening
after
dusk
under
that
willow
beside
her
at
last
we
sat
down
with
our
backs
against
the
weatherboard
wall
and
talked
about
day
chaps
said
a
stranger
appearing
at
the
door
of
the
store
got
any
pickles
in
stock
moriarty
lots
a
bottle
say
three
bottles
replied
the
stranger
seating
himself
on
the
counter
and
let
see
a
pound
of
tobacco
a
dozen
of
matches
a
tin
of
and
a
couple
of
i
make
that
do
till
i
get
as
far
as
hay
my
chaps
are
squealing
for
pickles
he
continued
turning
to
me
i
did
know
you
at
the
first
glance
your
collins
is
it
you
might
remember
me
passing
by
you
last
spring
a
few
miles
back
along
the
track
here
where
you
been
helping
steve
thompson
and
a
big
fellow
to
load
up
some
wool
on
a
wagon
so
that
chestnut
was
a
stolen
horse
after
all
smart
bit
of
work
another
devil
of
a
season
is
it
i
been
trying
to
shift
head
of
forward
stores
from
mamarool
to
vic
but
i
advised
the
owner
to
give
it
best
though
it
was
money
out
of
my
pocket
when
i
had
none
in
it
to
begin
with
managed
to
arrange
for
them
on
wooloomburra
till
the
winter
comes
on
whilst
speaking
he
had
opened
his
knife
and
removed
the
capsule
and
cork
from
one
of
the
bottles
of
pickles
then
after
drinking
some
of
the
vinegar
out
of
the
way
he
began
harpooning
the
contents
of
the
bottle
and
eating
them
with
a
relish
that
was
pleasant
to
see
i
made
a
suitable
reply
whilst
moriarty
having
made
up
his
order
noted
the
items
and
price
on
the
paper
which
contained
the
tobacco
i
see
alf
jones
is
gone
moriarty
i
remarked
after
a
pause
the
stranger
being
occupied
with
his
pickles
wisest
thing
he
could
do
foolishest
thing
he
could
do
replied
the
storekeeper
nosey
was
a
fixture
on
runnymede
he
was
one
of
montgomery
pets
and
if
he
thinks
he
can
better
that
in
australia
he
got
a
lot
to
learn
and
what
a
hurry
he
was
in
to
get
out
of
the
best
billet
he
ever
have
poor
beggar
with
his
shyness
and
his
disfigurement
but
he
been
on
the
pea
like
a
good
many
more
let
see
it
was
just
the
day
after
you
went
away
that
he
came
to
montgomery
and
said
he
must
go
that
be
six
or
eight
weeks
ago
now
montgomery
went
a
lot
out
of
his
way
to
persuade
him
to
stop
but
it
was
no
use
he
was
like
a
hen
on
a
hot
griddle
till
he
got
away
decent
chap
too
and
by
gosh
ca
he
sing
and
play
we
found
afterward
that
he
had
given
his
books
to
the
station
library
with
the
message
that
we
were
to
think
kindly
of
him
when
he
was
gone
i
felt
sort
of
melancholy
to
see
him
drifting
away
to
beggary
with
his
across
the
front
of
his
saddle
and
his
spare
horse
in
his
hand
he
knew
no
more
where
he
was
going
than
the
man
in
the
moon
do
you
believe
it
i
replied
these
cranky
fellows
have
always
sane
spots
in
their
heads
and
alf
is
particularly
lucky
in
that
respect
there
not
above
two
or
at
the
most
three
lobes
of
that
fellow
brain
in
bad
working
order
just
you
watch
the
weekly
papers
and
you
get
news
of
him
in
his
proper
sphere
he
gone
to
sydney
or
perhaps
melbourne
to
do
something
better
than
boundary
riding
no
he
gone
to
western
queensland
remarked
the
stranger
who
had
been
watching
moriarty
flies
without
the
trace
of
a
smile
on
his
saturnine
face
i
met
him
sixty
or
eighty
mile
beyond
the
darling
on
the
thargomindah
track
three
weeks
ago
not
the
same
fellow
surely
i
suggested
well
replied
the
stranger
tolerantly
the
young
chap
i
speaking
of
had
some
disfigurement
of
the
face
so
far
as
i
could
distinguish
through
a
short
crape
veil
and
he
was
carrying
a
box
that
he
evidently
would
trust
on
his
but
whether
it
was
a
or
a
child
coffin
i
was
rude
enough
to
ask
manton
slung
on
his
back
dog
brown
small
star
wd
conjoined
near
shoulder
c
or
g
near
flank
bay
mare
packed
js
off
shoulder
white
horses
in
rattling
condition
and
he
was
taking
his
time
he
been
boundary
riding
in
the
bland
country
before
coming
here
peculiar
habit
of
giving
his
head
a
little
toss
sometimes
when
he
spoke
that
him
right
enough
said
moriarty
had
you
a
yarn
with
him
not
much
of
a
yarn
certainly
replied
the
stranger
holding
his
bottle
up
to
the
light
while
he
speared
a
gherkin
with
his
knife
it
was
coming
on
evening
when
i
met
him
and
says
he
making
for
the
gilgie
have
you
come
past
it
so
i
told
him
if
he
wanted
to
camp
on
water
he
have
to
turn
back
five
mile
and
come
with
me
to
where
i
knew
of
a
brackish
dam
i
just
been
disappointed
of
water
myself
at
the
gilgie
it
had
been
a
few
days
before
but
a
dozen
of
elder
camels
had
called
there
carrying
tucker
to
mount
brown
and
each
of
them
had
scoffed
the
full
of
a
tank
talk
about
camels
doing
without
water
just
here
though
the
stranger
ordinary
language
was
singularly
quotable
in
character
he
digressed
into
a
searching
and
comprehensive
curse
extending
inclusively
from
sir
thomas
elder
away
back
along
the
vanishing
vista
of
time
to
the
first
man
who
had
conceived
the
idea
of
utilising
the
camel
as
a
beast
of
burthen
so
we
camped
late
at
night
he
resumed
in
a
relieved
tone
and
this
friend
of
yours
early
in
the
morning
he
was
interested
in
anything
but
the
diamantina
track
and
i
was
nasty
over
the
gilgie
so
we
did
yarn
much
however
that
chap
no
more
off
his
head
than
i
am
bit
odd
i
daresay
but
that
nothing
i
often
find
myself
a
bit
odd
negligent
and
forgetful
and
sort
of
imbecile
but
that
a
very
different
thing
from
being
off
your
head
why
just
now
i
saw
your
two
horses
in
the
paddock
as
i
came
up
and
if
i
was
to
be
lagged
for
it
i
could
think
where
i
had
seen
them
before
in
fact
not
till
i
recognised
you
want
of
sleep
i
blame
it
on
well
if
i
do
shift
there
wo
be
many
pickles
left
for
my
chaps
they
were
to
boil
the
billy
at
the
balahs
better
give
us
another
bottle
he
handed
moriarty
the
money
for
the
goods
and
stowed
them
in
a
small
boys
see
you
again
some
day
and
the
imbecile
stranger
trailed
his
spurs
from
our
presence
do
you
know
him
moriarty
i
asked
i
ca
say
i
do
replied
the
storekeeper
one
day
last
winter
i
happened
to
be
out
at
the
main
road
when
he
passed
with
head
of
fats
and
somehow
i
knew
that
his
name
was
spooner
never
saw
him
again
till
now
but
how
about
nosey
alf
was
i
right
for
once
and
were
you
wrong
for
once
so
it
appears
i
replied
but
you
have
told
me
how
you
worked
the
scandal
you
were
sitting
with
your
backs
against
the
wall
go
on
sitting
with
our
backs
against
the
wall
repeated
my
agent
complacently
well
we
began
to
talk
about
the
jealousy
there
was
amongst
the
station
chaps
on
account
of
jack
the
shellback
being
picked
to
take
nosey
place
and
from
that
we
got
round
to
gossip
about
you
stopping
with
nosey
the
evening
you
left
here
and
wondering
how
you
got
on
together
being
queer
in
different
ways
then
the
conversation
settled
down
on
you
and
we
even
quoted
a
remark
beaudesart
had
made
about
you
only
a
couple
of
hours
before
she
had
said
that
though
you
were
such
a
wonderful
talker
you
were
surprisingly
reticent
respecting
your
own
former
life
and
your
family
connections
and
the
place
you
came
from
we
commented
on
this
remark
and
laughed
a
bit
not
at
you
but
at
her
clever
engineering
was
it
not
unless
she
was
in
her
room
with
her
ear
against
the
wall
trust
her
replied
my
ambassador
confidently
she
saw
us
sitting
down
as
she
went
across
the
yard
and
we
counted
on
her
we
knew
her
meanness
in
the
matter
of
listening
do
say
i
remonstrated
i
must
take
her
part
there
you
ca
judge
even
a
woman
by
the
standard
of
a
moderately
mean
man
in
this
particular
phase
of
character
our
deepest
student
of
human
nature
makes
his
favourite
beatrice
on
receiving
a
hint
run
down
the
garden
like
a
lapwing
to
do
a
bit
of
deliberate
eavesdropping
whilst
her
masculine
counterpart
benedick
has
to
hear
his
share
of
the
disclosure
inadvertently
and
reluctantly
similarly
in
love
labour
lost
when
the
letter
is
handed
to
lord
boyet
to
read
he
says
this
letter
is
mistook
it
importeth
none
here
it
is
writ
to
jaquenetta
that
of
course
settles
the
matter
in
his
mind
but
the
princess
true
to
her
sex
says
eagerly
and
with
a
perfectly
clear
conscience
we
will
read
it
i
swear
break
the
neck
of
the
wax
and
let
every
one
give
ear
do
let
us
judge
women
by
our
standard
here
for
we
ca
afford
to
be
judged
by
their
standard
in
some
other
hear
hear
loud
applause
much
laughter
interrupted
the
delegate
flippantly
well
we
were
yarning
and
laughing
over
simplicity
and
it
came
out
that
nelson
and
mooney
knew
there
was
some
reason
why
you
dare
go
back
to
where
you
were
known
but
they
had
never
heard
the
story
so
i
put
them
on
their
honour
and
told
them
the
whole
affair
how
did
the
story
run
i
asked
my
vicar
repeated
it
which
is
more
than
i
can
do
well
that
ought
to
drum
me
out
of
her
esteem
i
remarked
with
the
feeling
of
a
man
respited
on
the
scaffold
and
it
hangs
together
fairly
well
for
a
fabrication
but
i
honestly
sorry
to
have
been
forced
to
put
such
an
office
on
you
moriarty
indeed
i
wonder
how
you
could
have
the
nerve
to
tell
such
a
yarn
in
a
woman
hearing
friendship
old
man
replied
my
factor
wammly
but
it
ai
a
fabrication
i
found
i
could
invent
anything
with
the
proper
ring
of
truth
about
it
so
the
evening
before
the
disclosure
when
jack
the
shellback
was
in
the
store
getting
some
things
to
take
out
with
him
i
asked
him
what
was
the
most
blackguardly
prank
he
ever
got
off
with
and
that
was
the
yarn
he
told
me
of
course
i
altered
it
a
bit
to
suit
you
and
beaudesart
believes
it
i
queried
hopefully
i
do
see
what
else
she
can
do
considering
the
way
the
thing
she
would
have
to
be
like
one
of
the
ancient
prophets
and
you
think
it
has
the
proper
effect
no
effect
at
all
replied
the
nuncio
decidedly
her
manner
just
the
same
when
she
hears
you
talked
about
promiscuously
and
she
does
take
it
any
way
ill
to
overhear
a
quiet
joke
about
the
thing
that
supposed
to
be
some
time
soon
it
a
failure
so
far
as
that
goes
certain
as
life
well
moriarty
if
dishonour
has
no
effect
we
must
try
disgrace
why
they
the
same
you
better
go
back
to
school
collins
they
entirely
independent
of
each
other
if
you
insist
on
bringing
me
back
to
school
to
waste
my
time
over
one
barren
pupil
poverty
for
instance
is
disgrace
without
dishonour
is
dishonour
without
disgrace
in
cases
like
mine
the
dishonour
lies
in
the
fact
and
the
disgrace
in
the
publicity
you
must
set
the
whole
station
commenting
on
your
scandal
that
just
what
the
whole
station
is
doing
at
the
present
time
replied
my
legate
unctuously
surprising
how
these
things
spread
of
themselves
when
they
once
fairly
started
and
everybody
believes
the
yarn
bar
mooney
and
nelson
and
myself
and
you
can
depend
your
life
on
us
to
keep
it
jigging
no
i
wrong
montgomery
got
the
inside
crook
on
us
montgomery
said
i
inquiringly
yes
i
got
a
fright
over
that
explained
the
diplomatist
the
other
morning
i
was
at
some
correspondence
here
and
i
heard
a
quick
step
and
when
i
looked
up
who
should
i
see
but
montgomery
as
black
as
thunder
says
he
in
a
voice
that
made
me
jump
is
this
story
i
hear
of
collins
now
no
shuffling
says
he
traced
it
home
to
you
and
i
want
your
authority
i
always
looked
upon
collins
as
a
decent
sort
of
oddity
says
he
i
determined
to
sift
this
matter
thoroughly
frightened
me
out
of
a
year
growth
moriarty
paused
and
drew
a
long
breath
well
said
i
hazily
wondering
whether
this
piteous
wreckage
of
plot
was
owing
to
some
defect
in
my
own
strategy
or
to
bad
lieutenantry
in
the
working
out
so
i
had
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
continued
the
plenipotentiary
in
a
reluctant
and
apologetic
tone
no
use
talking
it
was
impossible
to
stand
to
the
yarn
when
montgomery
eye
was
on
me
let
alone
being
taken
by
surprise
it
was
dragged
from
me
by
a
sort
of
hypodermic
influence
and
all
the
fun
seemed
to
have
died
out
of
it
till
it
sounded
mean
and
small
and
unmanly
yes
i
had
to
tell
him
the
fix
you
were
in
and
the
commission
you
had
given
me
and
everything
from
first
to
last
bar
that
infernal
wager
well
you
know
montgomery
never
laughs
but
i
saw
his
face
twitching
once
or
twice
and
before
i
had
done
he
wheeled
round
and
stood
looking
out
of
the
door
as
if
i
was
worth
listening
to
then
he
went
away
coughing
fit
to
break
his
neck
i
may
thank
him
for
being
tree
in
the
first
place
and
he
knows
it
i
remarked
with
a
sourness
which
appears
pardonable
even
at
this
distance
of
time
what
had
he
got
to
do
with
it
asked
moriarty
how
the
tempus
does
fugit
i
replied
for
the
bell
was
ringing
at
the
hut
best
sound
since
said
moriarty
rising
come
on
to
lunch
as
we
left
the
store
representatives
of
the
lower
classes
were
from
different
directions
toward
the
hut
to
attend
to
the
most
ancient
and
eminent
of
human
institutions
the
institution
which
predicates
and
affirms
the
brotherhood
of
our
race
as
positively
and
to
the
philosophic
mind
as
touchingly
as
death
itself
being
recognised
and
remembered
by
the
aristocrat
who
forgets
his
own
personal
and
by
the
woman
who
forgets
the
date
of
her
birth
by
the
friend
who
forgets
the
insulting
language
he
used
to
you
when
he
was
under
the
influence
and
by
the
boy
who
forgets
his
catechism
the
is
the
real
ducdame
ducdame
ducdame
the
greek
invocation
which
calls
fools
into
a
circle
as
surely
as
wise
men
for
neither
folly
nor
wisdom
is
proof
against
its
spell
just
then
two
swagmen
on
foot
came
into
the
yard
and
approached
moriarty
and
me
i
fixed
my
belltopper
adjusted
my
specs
and
assumed
my
stately
pipe
whilst
my
soul
went
forth
in
psalms
of
thanksgiving
here
was
the
true
key
to
the
wilcannia
shower
here
was
the
of
my
imagined
precaution
against
ophthalmia
here
was
the
hidden
purpose
of
that
repetitional
picking
and
sorting
of
the
hawker
stock
which
had
left
jack
the
shellback
his
hobson
choice
in
coats
here
was
a
wesleyan
converging
of
the
whole
vast
order
of
the
universe
toward
the
happiest
issue
for
here
was
tom
armstrong
at
last
and
i
stood
prepared
to
force
a
temporary
renewal
albeit
for
double
the
original
amount
of
the
bill
drawn
by
me
on
the
royal
inevitable
and
now
about
to
be
presented
by
the
legitimate
holder
is
the
bose

asked
the
holder
briskly
turning
first
to
moriarty
and
then
to
me
losh
it
no
tam
he
swung
his
swag
to
the
ground
and
extended
his

replied
with

politeness
and
a
hearty
though
i
felt
like
a
man
in
the
act
of
parrying
a
rifle
bullet
i
have
a
wretched

tam

replied
the
young
fellow
moving
toward
the
barracks
the
boss
was
saying
there
was
a
few
burrs
that
would
have
to
be
looked

ava
he
resumed
his
swag
i
made
a
sign
perceptible
only
to
moriarty
and
the
latter
hesitated
a
moment
by
virtue
of
a
fine
tradition
or
unwritten
law
handed
down
from
the
time
of
montgomery
father
a
subaltern
officer
of
runnymede
had
power
to
send
any
swagman
or
a
couple
of
them
for
that
matter
to
the
hut
for
a
feed
certain
conditions
however
had
formulated
themselves
around
this
prerogative
first
the
stranger
must
of
necessity
be
a
man
second
he
must
be
within
the
precincts
of
the
homestead
at
the
ringing
of
the
bell
third
the
officer
must
walk
down
to
the
hut
with
him
as
a
testimony
fourth
no
particular
sub
must
make
a
trade
of
it
the
prerogative
was
something
like
one
enjoyed
by
abbots
and
other
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
in
the
ages
of
faith
namely
the
right
to
extend
the
jurisdiction
and
protection
of
the
church
over
any
secular
prisoner
accidentally
met
on
his
way
to
execution
a
prerogative
the
existence
of
which
depended
on
its
not
being
abused
and
though
moriarty
was
only
on
the
commissariat
and
was
therefore
unmercifully
by
the
vulgar
whenever
he
presumed
to
give
orders
he
held
this
right
through
a
series
of
forerunners
extending
back
to
the
time
when
montgomery
had
been
his
own
storekeeper
do
you
believe
the
yarns
your
enthusiast
tells
of
the
squatter
hospitality
toward
the
swagman
such
things
were
and
are
but
i
would
advise
you
to
count
upon
the
institution
as
a
neat
and
easy
escape
from
the
adamic
penalty
you
might
hence
moriarty
personal
reluctance
in
the
matter
was
perfectly
natural
the
meal
at
the
hut
and
the
pannikin
of
dust
at
the
store
are
two
widely
different
things
but
a
faithful
and
exhaustive
inquiry
into
the
ethics
of
station
hospitality
would
fill
many
pages
for
the
question
has
more
than
one
aspect
go
down
to
the
hut
and
have
some
dinner
said
moriarty
turning
back
and
we
preceded
the
two
men
on
their
way
can
you
make
room
for
these
chaps
matt
he
asked
looking
into
the
hut
the
cook
growled
assent
and
the
two
strangers
took
their
places
at
the
table
scotty
thought
he
knew
you
observed
moriarty
with
characteristic
profundity
as
we
turned
again
toward
the
barracks
the
remark
broke
a
spell
that
was
coming
over
me
and
i
thought
i
knew
his
mate
though
i
ca
manage
to
locate
him
i
replied
but
as
i
was
telling
scotty
i
have
the
worst
memory
in
the
world
for
faces
ay
that
poor
wreck
would
fetch
much
in
the
yard
remarked
moriarty
referring
to
tam
mate
when
a
fellow
comes
to
his
state
he
ought
to
be
turned
out
for
the
summer
in
a
swamp
paddock
with
the
leeches
on
his
legs
then
you
ought
to
sell
him
to
cobb
and
to
get
the
last
kick
out
of
him
or
else
the
beggar
very
good
system
moriarty
apply
it
to
yourself
also
you
not
dead
yet
but
i
never
come
to
that
state
of
affairs
assuredly
you
will
sonny
just
for
the
remark
you
made
but
i
like
to
see
that
fellow
again
go
on
to
the
barracks
i
be
after
you
in
two
minutes
confused
identity
seemed
to
be
in
the
air
had
i
seen
that
weary
looking
figure
and
that
face
before
i
could
determine
and
i
ca
determine
now
but
the
question
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
record
at
all
events
impelled
partly
by
a
desire
to
have
another
look
at
the
man
and
partly
perhaps
by
a
morbid
longing
to
flaunt
myself
before
tam
i
grandly
dipped
my
lofty
belltopper
under
the
doorway
of
the
hut
and
without
removing
it
helped
myself
to
a
pannikin
of
tea
from
the
bucket
by
the
hearth
and
sat
down
opposite
the
silent
swagman
farther
along
the
table
tam
was
already
in
the
stream
of
conversation
in
answer
to
some
question
he
was
replying
that
he
had
been
only

months

an

ten

all
this
while
i
had
been
observing
the
silent
swagman
who
seemed
to
grow
uneasy
under
my
notice
i
was
remarking
to
a
friend
just
now
that
i
fancied
i
had
seen
you
before
i
explained
well
they
ai
actilly

the

in

relief
i

nor

i
had

he
give
me
a
little
bottle
o

the
other
day
an
it
seems
to
be
about
the
correct
thing
jist
feels
like
a
spoonful
o
ashes
in
your
eye
an
if
a
drop
falls
outside
it
tums
your
skin
black
that
ought
to
cut
away
the

o
glassy
phlegm
off

interrupted
the

sadly
and
sullenly
an
i

he
continued
raising
his

in
attempted

ai

gittin

for

well
the

collins
persisted
dave
i
neither
know
him
nor
do
i
feel
any
aching
void
in
consequence
i
replied
pointedly
interpolating
in
two
places
the
quidnunc
flowers
of
speech
how
did
the
evidence
go
mate
asked
the
young
fellow
greedily
eh
how
did
the
evidence
go
oh
yes
well
i
a
bit
hard
o
hearin
i
dunno

you
notice
it

i

with

course
it
all
in
a
man
lifetime
pursued
andrew
resignedly
same
time
it
seems
sort
a
hard
lines
when
a
man
shoved
in
the
logs
for
the
best
three
months
in
the
year
for
a
thing
he
never
done
i
was
on
for
a
good
long
job
with
two
as
decent
a
fellers
as
you
meet
in
a
day
walk
i
met
one
o
them
ten
mile
up
the
river
as
it
might
be
this
afternoon
an
the
fire
it
took
place
as
it
might
be
mornin
but
where
was
you
when
the
fire
that
the
question
demanded
dave
with
a
pleasant
round
the
table
eh
you
be
bumpin
up
agen
a
snag
some
o
these
times
young
feller
muttered
the
bullock
driver
i
was
only
askin
him
where
he
was
when
the
fire
broke
out
protested
somebody
darling
then
in
a
louder
voice
he
repeated
his
question
dunno
somewhere
close
handy
replied
the
swagman
hopelessly
anyhow
i
never
done
it
well
then
i
jist
got
well
started
to
work
on
monday
mornin
when
up
comes
the
bobby
an
grabs
me
you
have
to
go
says
the
missus
for
the
bosses
was
both
away
at
another
place
they
got
so
says
i
take
my
swag
with
me
anyhow
course
by
the
time
my
three
months
was
up
things
was
at
the
slackest
an
i
could
go
straight
back
to
a
decent
place
an
me
fresh
out
o
chokey
fact
i
ca
go
back
to
that
district
no
more
but
as
luck
would
have
it
i
runs
butt
agen
the
very
man
i
ratherest
meet
of
anybody
in
the
country
the
swagman
paused
and
slowly
turned
toward
me
in
evident
trouble
of
mind
he
did
tell
you
two
blokes
i
was
logged
for
and
the
poor
fellow
flickering
eyes
sought
my
face
appealingly
indeed
he
did
mate
why
you
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
yourself
exclaimed
dave
triumphantly
then
the
conversation
took
a
more
general
turn
by
this
time
i
had
provisionally
accounted
for
my
recognition
of
the
man
with
the
circumspection
of
a
seasoned
speculatist
i
had
bracketed
two
independent
hypotheses
either
of
which
would
supply
a
satisfactory
solution
one
of
these
simply
attributed
the
whole
matter
to
unconscious
cerebration
but
here
a
question
arose
if
one
half
of
my
brain
had
been
more
alert
than
its
duplicate
when
the
object
first
presented
itself
so
that
the
observation
of
the
vigilant
half
instantaneously
appeared
as
an
intangible
memory
to
the
judgment
of
the
apathetic
half
it
still
remained
to
be
determined
which
of
the
halves
might
be
said
to
be
in
a
normal
condition
was
one
half
unduly
and
wastefully
excited
or
was
the
other
half
unhealthily
dormant
the
thing
would
have
to
be
seen
into
at
some
fitting
time
but
this
hypothesis
of
unconscious
cerebration
seemed
scarcely
as
satisfactory
as
the
that
having
at
a
former
time
heard
terrible
tommy
mention
the
name
of
andrew
glover
my
educated
instinct
of
nomenology
rising
to
the
very
acme
of
efficiency
had
accurately
though
unconsciously
a
corresponding
apparition
on
the
retina
of
my
mind
eye
then
there
were
lessons
to
be
gathered
from
tom
armstrongs
prompt
acceptance
of
such
alibi
evidence
touching
myself
as
would
have
merely
tended
to
unfathomable
speculations
on
metempsychosis
in
an
tom
though
crushing
for
a
couple
of
ounces
was
one
of
your
practical
decided
cocksure
men
guided
by
unweighed
unanalysed
phenomena
and
governed
by
conviction
alone
the
latter
being
based
simply
though
solidly
upon
itself
these
men
are
deaf
to
the
symphony
of
the
silences
blind
to
the
horizonless
areas
of
the
unknown
unresponsive
to
the
touch
of
the
impalpable
oblivious
to
the
machinery
of
the
moral
universe
in
a
word
indifferent
to
the
mysterious
motive
of
nature
soul
in
such
mental
organisms
opinion
once
deflected
tangentially
from
the
central
truth
acquires
an
independent
and
stubborn
orbit
of
its
own
but
the
absolute
truth
is
so
large
and
human
opinion
so
small
that
the
latter
can
not
get
away
altogether
however
eccentric
its
course
may
be
indeed
the
more
elongated
the
orbit
of
error
the
greater
chance
of
its
being
swallowed
up
by
the
scorching
truth
on
its
return
trip
in
the
present
instance
my
own
ready
with
a
marvellously
conducive
providential
legislation
had
been
sufficient
unto
the
deflection
of
tom
opinion
and
i
was
content
to
let
the
collision
take
thought
for
itself
particularly
as
beaudesart
conjunction
was
just
about
falling
due
then
i
rose
to
go
here
mate
said
i
fearlessly
removing
my
clouded
glasses
and
handing
them
with
their
case
to
andrew
you
find
the
advantage
of
these
there
was
no
trace
of
recognition
in
tom
look
of
gratitude
as
his
eyes
rested
on
my
face
but
i
sighed
to
reflect
that
he
was
still
looking
out
for
the
tracks
of
that
miserable
impostor
from
the
braes
o
yarra
now
i
had
to
enact
the
cynic
philosopher
to
moriarty
and
butler
and
the
aristocratic
man
with
a
to
beaudesart
with
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
each
of
these
was
acting
a
part
to
me
such
is
life
my
just
like
a
poor
player
that
bluffs
and
feints
his
hour
upon
the
stage
and
then
cheapens
down
to
mere
nonentity
but
let
me
not
hear
any
small
witticism
to
the
further
effect
that
its
story
is
a
tale
told
by
a
vulgarian
full
of
slang
and
blanky
signifying
nothing
the
end
end
of
this
project
