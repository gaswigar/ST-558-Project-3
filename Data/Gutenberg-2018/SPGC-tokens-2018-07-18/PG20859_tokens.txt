it
a
planet
i
said
a
little
world
how
little
venza
demanded
the
mass
of
the
moon
that
what
they
calculated
now
and
how
far
is
it
away
anita
asked
i
heard
a
newscaster
say
yesterday
newscasters
venza
broke
in
scornfully
say
you
can
take
what
they
tell
you
about
any
danger
or
trouble
and
cut
it
in
half
and
even
then
you
be
on
the
gloomy
side
see
here
gregg
haljan
i
not
giving
you
newscasters
blare
i
retorted
extravagant
vehemence
was
always
refreshing
the
venus
girl
glared
at
me
i
added
anita
mentioned
newscasters
i
did
anita
was
in
no
mood
for
smiling
tell
us
gregg
she
sat
upright
and
tense
her
chin
cupped
in
her
hands
tell
us
for
a
fact
they
do
know
much
about
it
yet
you
can
call
it
a
planet
a
wanderer
i
should
say
it
was
a
wanderer
venza
exclaimed
coming
from
heaven
knows
where
beyond
the
stars
swimming
in
here
like
a
comet
they
calculated
its
distance
yesterday
at
some
million
miles
from
earth
i
said
it
is
so
far
beyond
the
orbit
of
mars
coming
diagonally
and
heading
very
nearly
for
the
sun
but
it
not
a
comet
the
thing
was
indeed
inexplicable
for
many
weeks
now
astronomers
had
been
studying
it
this
was
early
summer
of
the
year
all
of
us
had
recently
returned
from
those
extraordinary
events
i
have
already
recounted
when
we
came
close
to
losing
johnny
radiactum
treasure
on
the
moon
and
our
lives
as
well
my
ship
the
in
the
astronomical
seasons
when
the
earth
mars
and
venus
were
within
comfortable
traveling
distances
of
each
other
had
carried
mail
and
passengers
from
greater
new
york
to
of
the
martian
union
and
to
grebhar
of
the
venus
free
state
now
it
was
wrecked
on
the
moon
footnote
see
brigands
of
the
moon
ace
book
i
had
been
under
navigating
officer
of
the
upon
her
i
had
met
anita
prince
whose
only
living
relative
her
brother
was
among
those
killed
in
the
struggle
with
the
brigands
anita
and
i
were
soon
to
marry
we
hoped
i
was
waiting
now
in
greater
new
york
upon
the
decision
of
the
line
officials
regarding
another
spaceship
perhaps
i
would
have
command
of
it
since
captain
carter
of
the
had
been
killed
it
was
a
month
or
so
before
that
adventure
april
that
this
mysterious
visitor
from
interstellar
space
first
appeared
upon
our
astronomical
horizon
a
little
thing
at
first
a
mere
unusual
dot
a
pinpoint
on
a
star
diagram
which
should
not
have
been
there
it
occasioned
no
comment
at
the
time
save
that
some
thought
it
might
be
another
planet
beyond
pluto
but
this
was
not
taken
seriously
enough
to
get
into
the
newscasts
none
of
us
had
heard
about
it
as
late
as
may
when
the
set
out
on
what
was
to
be
her
final
voyage
presently
it
was
seen
that
the
object
could
not
be
a
planet
of
our
solar
system
coming
in
at
tremendous
speed
it
daily
changed
its
aspect
gathering
velocity
until
soon
it
was
not
a
dot
but
a
streak
on
every
in
a
week
or
so
the
thing
passed
from
an
astronomical
curiosity
to
an
item
of
public
news
and
now
early
in
june
when
it
had
cut
through
the
orbit
of
jupiter
and
was
approaching
that
of
mars
fear
was
growing
the
visitor
was
a
menace
no
astronomical
body
could
come
among
us
with
a
mass
as
great
as
a
fifth
of
the
moon
without
causing
trouble
the
newscasters
with
a
ready
skill
for
lurid
possibilities
were
blaring
of
all
sorts
of
horrible
events
impending
i
told
the
girls
all
i
knew
of
the
approaching
wanderer
the
density
was
similar
to
that
of
earth
the
oncoming
velocity
and
the
calculated
elements
of
its
orbit
now
were
such
that
within
a
few
weeks
more
the
new
planet
would
round
our
sun
and
presumably
head
outward
again
it
would
pass
within
a
few
million
miles
of
us
causing
a
disturbance
to
earth
orbit
even
a
change
of
the
inclination
of
our
axis
affecting
our
tides
and
our
climate
so
i
heard
venza
interrupted
me
they
say
that
and
then
they
stop
why
ca
a
newscaster
tell
you
what
is
so
mysterious
for
a
very
good
reason
venza
because
you
ca
throw
people
into
a
panic
this
whole
thing
up
to
today
has
been
withheld
from
the
public
of
earth
and
venus
the
martian
union
tried
to
withhold
it
but
could
not
every
heliogram
between
the
worlds
is
censored
and
still
said
venza
sarcastically
you
do
tell
us
what
is
so
mysterious
about
this
wanderer
for
one
thing
i
said
it
changes
its
direction
no
normal
heavenly
body
does
that
they
calculated
the
elements
of
its
orbit
last
april
they
done
it
twenty
times
since
and
every
time
the
projected
orbit
is
different
just
a
little
at
first
but
last
week
the
accursed
thing
actually
took
a
sudden
turn
as
though
it
were
a
spaceship
the
girls
stared
at
me
what
does
that
mean
anita
asked
they
beginning
to
make
wild
guesses
but
we
wo
go
into
that
what
else
is
mysterious
venza
demanded
the
thing
is
normally
visible
venza
shifted
her
legs
do
talk
in
code
not
normally
visible
i
repeated
a
world
as
large
as
the
moon
could
be
seen
plainly
by
our
when
well
beyond
pluto
now
between
jupiter
and
mars
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
of
course
but
still
it
not
very
far
away
i
been
out
there
myself
with
instruments
we
ought
to
be
able
to
see
its
surface
see
whether
it
has
land
and
water
inhabitants
perhaps
you
should
be
able
to
distinguish
an
object
on
its
surface
as
large
as
a
city
but
you
ca
why
not
asked
anita
are
the
clouds
too
thick
what
causes
it
they
do
even
know
that
i
retorted
there
is
something
abnormal
about
the
coming
from
it
not
exactly
blurred
but
a
distortion
a
fading
it
some
abnormality
of
the
a
swift
rapping
on
our
interrupted
me
and
snap
dean
burst
in
everybody
is
it
a
conference
you
look
so
solemn
he
dashed
across
the
room
kissed
venza
pretended
that
he
was
about
to
kiss
anita
and
winked
at
me
he
was
a
dynamic
little
fellow
small
wiry
and
and
had
been
the
operator
of
the
he
was
a
perfect
match
for
venza
for
all
the
millions
of
miles
that
separated
their
native
lands
venza
too
was
small
and
slim
her
manner
as
readily
jocular
as
his
and
where
have
you
been
venza
demanded
me
my
private
life
is
my
own
so
far
we
not
married
yet
since
you
insist
on
us
going
to
grebhar
for
the
ceremony
do
stop
it
protested
anita
we
been
talking
of
i
know
very
well
what
you
been
talking
about
everybody
is
got
news
for
you
gregg
he
went
abruptly
solemn
and
lowered
his
voice
halsey
wants
to
see
us
right
away
i
regarded
him
blankly
and
my
mind
swept
back
no
more
than
a
few
short
weeks
ago
halsey
of
divisional
headquarters
here
in
greater
new
york
had
sent
for
us
and
we
had
been
precipitated
into
the
grantline
affair
halsey
i
burst
out
easy
gregg
snap
cast
a
vague
look
around
anita
draped
apartment
an
open
window
was
beside
us
leading
to
a
tiny
catwalk
balcony
it
was
moonlit
now
and
two
hundred
feet
above
the
pedestrian
viaduct
but
snap
continued
to
frown
easy
i
tell
you
why
shout
about
halsey
the
air
can
have
ears
venza
moved
and
closed
and
sealed
the
window
what
is
it
i
asked
more
softly
but
snap
was
not
satisfied
anita
do
you
have
a
complete
isolation
barrage
for
this
room
of
course
i
have
snap
well
gregg
do
you
have
a
detector
with
you
i
had
none
snap
produced
his
little
coil
and
indicator
dial
out
of
order
but
let
see
now
shove
over
that
chair
gregg
he
disconnected
one
of
the
room
and
contacted
with
the
cathode
it
was
a
makeshift
method
but
as
he
dropped
to
the
floor
uncoiling
a
little
length
of
his
wire
for
an
external
we
saw
that
the
thing
worked
the
pointer
on
the
was
swaying
gregg
he
muttered
look
at
that
did
i
tell
you
the
pointer
quivered
in
positive
reaction
an
eavesdropping
ray
was
upon
us
anita
gasped
i
had
no
idea
no
but
i
did
snap
added
softly
no
one
very
close
he
and
i
carried
the
detector
to
the
length
of
the
hall
the
indicator
went
nearer
normal
it
must
be
the
other
way
i
whispered
we
went
to
the
moonlit
balcony
way
down
there
on
the
pedestrian
arcade
i
said
we
soon
fix
that
snap
said
inside
the
room
we
made
connection
with
a
newscaster
blaring
voice
under
cover
of
it
we
could
talk
snap
gathered
us
close
around
him
halsey
has
something
important
and
it
about
this
interstellar
invader
it
all
connects
his
office
paged
me
on
a
public
mirror
i
happened
to
see
it
at
when
i
answered
it
halsey
man
wanted
me
to
talk
in
code
i
ca
talk
in
code
i
have
enough
to
worry
about
with
the
interplanetary
helios
then
they
sent
me
to
an
official
booth
where
i
got
examined
for
positive
legal
identification
and
then
they
put
me
on
the
official
length
after
all
of
which
precautions
i
was
told
to
be
at
office
tonight
at
midnight
and
told
a
few
other
things
what
demanded
venza
breathlessly
only
hints
why
take
chances
by
repeating
them
now
you
said
he
wants
me
too
i
put
in
yes
you
and
venza
we
got
to
get
into
his
office
secretly
by
the
vacuum
cylinders
we
to
meet
a
man
from
his
office
at
the
eighth
postal
venza
anita
said
sharply
what
in
the
universe
can
he
want
with
venza
if
she
going
i
going
too
snap
gazed
at
her
and
grinned
that
sounds
like
a
logical
deduction
naturally
he
must
want
you
that
why
he
said
venza
i
going
anita
insisted
we
left
half
an
hour
before
midnight
the
girls
were
both
in
gray
with
long
capes
we
took
the
public
monorail
into
the
section
under
the
city
roof
of
the
business
district
and
into
the
eighth
postal
where
the
sleek
bronze
cylinders
came
tumbling
out
of
the
vacuum
ports
to
be
and
dispatched
again
a
man
was
on
the
lookout
for
us
daniel
dean
and
party
yes
we
were
ordered
here
the
detective
gazed
at
the
girls
and
at
me
it
was
three
dean
and
now
it
four
said
snap
cheerfully
the
extra
one
is
miss
anita
prince
ever
heard
of
her
he
had
indeed
all
right
he
said
if
you
and
haljan
say
so
we
were
put
into
one
of
the
oversized
mail
cylinders
and
routed
through
the
tubes
like
sacks
of
recorded
letters
in
ten
minutes
with
a
thump
that
knocked
the
breath
out
of
all
of
us
we
were
in
the
of
halsey
outer
office
we
clambered
from
the
cylinder
our
guide
led
us
down
one
of
the
gloomy
metal
corridors
it
echoed
with
our
tread
a
door
lifted
daniel
dean
and
party
the
guard
stood
aside
come
in
the
door
slid
down
behind
us
we
advanced
into
the
small
apartment
like
a
vault
colonel
halsey
sat
at
his
desk
with
a
few
papers
before
him
and
a
bank
of
instrument
controls
at
his
elbow
he
pushed
his
audiphone
and
to
one
side
sit
down
please
he
gave
us
each
the
benefit
of
a
welcoming
smile
and
his
gaze
finished
upon
anita
i
came
because
you
sent
for
venza
anita
said
quickly
please
colonel
halsey
let
me
stay
i
thought
whatever
you
want
her
for
you
might
need
me
too
quite
so
miss
prince
perhaps
i
shall
it
seemed
that
in
his
mind
were
many
of
the
thoughts
thronging
my
own
for
he
added
haljan
i
recall
i
sent
for
you
like
this
once
before
i
hope
this
may
be
a
more
auspicious
occasion
so
do
i
sir
snap
said
we
been
afraid
hardly
to
do
more
than
a
whisper
but
you
insulated
here
and
we
mighty
curious
halsey
nodded
i
can
talk
freely
to
you
and
yet
i
can
not
his
gaze
went
to
venza
it
is
you
in
whom
i
am
most
interested
me
you
flatter
me
colonel
halsey
she
sat
gracefully
reclining
in
the
metal
chair
before
his
desk
seeming
small
as
a
child
between
its
big
broad
arms
her
long
gray
skirt
had
parted
to
display
her
shapely
legs
she
had
thrown
off
the
hood
of
her
cloak
her
thick
black
hair
was
coiled
in
a
knot
low
at
the
back
of
her
neck
her
carmine
lips
bore
an
alluring
smile
it
was
all
instinctive
to
this
girl
from
venus
it
came
as
naturally
as
she
breathed
halsey
gray
eyes
twinkled
do
not
look
at
me
quite
like
that
miss
venza
or
i
shall
forget
what
i
have
to
say
you
would
get
the
better
of
me
i
glad
you
not
a
criminal
so
am
i
she
declared
what
can
i
do
for
you
colonel
halsey
his
smile
faded
at
once
his
glance
included
us
all
just
this
there
is
a
man
here
in
greater
new
york
a
martian
whom
they
call
molo
he
has
a
younger
sister
meka
have
any
of
you
heard
of
them
we
had
not
halsey
went
on
slowly
now
apparently
choosing
his
words
with
the
greatest
care
there
are
things
that
i
can
tell
you
and
there
are
things
that
i
can
not
why
not
asked
venza
my
dear
for
one
thing
if
you
are
going
to
help
me
you
can
do
it
best
by
not
knowing
too
much
for
another
i
have
my
orders
this
thing
concerns
the
very
highest
authorities
not
only
of
the
but
in
and
grebhar
too
he
paused
but
none
of
us
spoke
then
halsey
said
quietly
well
this
martian
and
his
sister
are
here
now
in
greater
new
york
they
have
some
secret
they
are
engaged
in
some
activity
and
i
want
to
find
out
what
it
is
i
have
picked
up
only
little
parts
of
it
he
stopped
and
out
of
the
silence
snap
said
if
you
do
mind
colonel
halsey
it
seems
to
me
you
are
mostly
talking
in
code
i
not
but
i
trying
to
tell
you
as
little
as
possible
you
miss
venza
need
only
understand
this
the
martian
molo
must
be
induced
to
give
you
some
idea
of
what
he
is
doing
here
and
i
am
to
induce
him
venza
asked
calmly
that
is
my
idea
the
faint
shadow
of
a
smile
swept
halsey
thin
intent
face
my
dear
you
are
a
girl
of
venus
more
than
that
you
have
far
more
than
your
normal
share
of
wits
and
brains
it
did
not
make
venza
smile
she
sat
tense
now
with
her
gaze
fastened
on
halsey
face
anita
equally
breathless
reached
over
and
gripped
her
hand
then
venza
said
slowly
i
realize
colonel
halsey
that
this
is
something
vital
as
vital
my
child
as
it
could
be
he
drew
a
long
breath
i
want
you
to
understand
i
am
doing
my
duty
doing
what
seems
the
best
thing
not
for
you
perhaps
but
for
the
world
i
seemed
to
see
into
his
mind
at
that
moment
he
might
have
been
a
father
sending
a
daughter
into
danger
i
need
not
disguise
the
danger
i
have
lost
a
dozen
men
he
lighted
a
cigarette
i
do
seem
to
be
able
to
frighten
you
no
she
said
and
i
heard
anita
murmur
oh
venza
but
you
frighten
me
said
snap
colonel
look
here
you
know
going
to
marry
this
girl
very
soon
yes
i
know
you
have
to
consider
this
a
sacrifice
a
voluntary
descent
into
danger
for
a
great
cause
in
a
great
crisis
you
four
have
just
come
out
of
a
very
considerable
danger
we
know
of
what
stuff
you
are
made
all
of
you
he
smiled
again
perhaps
that
prominence
is
unfortunate
for
you
but
let
me
settle
it
now
is
there
any
one
of
you
who
will
not
take
my
orders
and
trust
my
judgement
of
what
is
best
and
do
it
if
need
be
blindly
will
you
offer
yourselves
to
me
we
gazed
at
each
other
both
the
girls
instantly
murmured
yes
yes
i
said
at
last
it
was
not
too
hard
for
me
for
i
thought
i
was
yielding
him
venza
not
anita
snap
was
very
pale
he
stared
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
yes
he
said
finally
but
colonel
surely
you
can
tell
us
more
halsey
tossed
his
cigarette
away
i
will
tell
you
as
much
as
i
think
best
these
martians
molo
and
his
sister
do
not
know
of
venza
at
least
i
think
that
they
do
not
they
apparently
have
not
been
here
very
long
how
they
got
here
we
do
know
there
was
no
passenger
or
freight
ship
in
they
have
a
dubious
reputation
at
best
but
i
wo
go
into
that
venza
i
will
show
you
these
martians
and
the
rest
depends
upon
you
there
is
a
mystery
you
will
find
out
what
it
is
he
reached
for
his
audiphone
i
want
to
locate
the
martian
molo
francis
staff
has
it
in
charge
the
audible
connection
came
in
a
moment
francis
we
could
hear
the
answering
microphonic
voice
yes
colonel
is
the
fellow
in
a
public
place
by
any
chance
in
the
red
spark
cafe
colonel
with
his
sister
and
a
party
good
enough
the
red
spark
has
an
have
you
visual
connection
yes
the
whole
room
they
have
a
dozen
finders
use
a
magnifier
get
me
the
closest
view
you
can
it
done
colonel
i
did
it
just
in
case
you
called
connect
it
in
a
moment
our
was
glowing
with
the
square
image
of
the
interior
of
the
red
spark
cafe
i
knew
the
place
by
reputation
a
fashionable
more
or
less
disreputable
eating
drinking
and
dancing
restaurant
where
money
and
alcholite
flowed
freely
the
patrons
were
successful
criminals
of
the
three
worlds
intermingled
with
thrilled
respectable
tourists
who
hoped
they
would
see
something
really
evil
the
red
spark
was
not
far
from
halsey
office
it
was
perched
high
in
a
break
of
the
city
roof
almost
directly
over
there
he
is
said
halsey
we
crowded
around
his
desk
the
image
showed
the
interior
of
a
large
oval
room
balconied
and
terraced
a
dais
raised
high
in
the
center
with
three
professional
couples
gyrating
there
and
beneath
them
the
public
slowly
rotating
on
its
central
axis
a
hundred
or
so
couples
were
dancing
the
lower
floor
was
crowded
with
dining
tables
others
were
upon
the
little
catwalk
balconies
and
still
others
in
the
terraced
nooks
and
side
niches
by
colored
draperies
the
image
now
was
silent
for
halsey
was
not
bothering
with
audio
connection
but
it
was
a
riot
of
color
flashing
colored
floodlights
bathing
the
dancers
in
vivid
tints
and
there
were
twinkling
spots
of
colored
on
all
the
tables
i
saw
too
the
blank
rectangles
of
darkness
against
the
walls
which
marked
the
private
dining
rooms
insulated
against
sight
and
sound
here
one
might
go
for
frivolous
indiscretion
or
for
conspiracy
perhaps
and
be
as
secure
from
interruption
as
we
were
here
in
halsey
office
venza
asked
eagerly
which
is
he
over
there
on
the
third
terrace
to
the
left
that
table
there
seem
to
be
six
of
them
in
the
party
we
heard
francis
voice
he
was
in
halsey
lower
manhattan
office
with
this
same
image
before
him
we
get
a
closer
view
the
table
in
question
was
no
more
than
a
square
inch
on
our
image
we
could
see
an
apparently
gay
party
of
men
and
women
one
of
the
couples
was
gigantic
a
martian
man
and
woman
obviously
the
others
seemed
to
be
earth
or
venus
people
francis
voice
added
i
got
an
audio
magnifier
on
them
been
listening
for
an
hour
nice
clear
english
much
good
it
does
us
this
fellow
is
as
cautious
as
a
director
of
the
lower
your
our
image
shifted
to
another
view
the
with
which
we
were
connected
now
gave
us
a
view
directly
over
the
martian
table
we
were
looking
down
diagonally
upon
the
table
at
a
distance
of
no
more
than
ten
feet
there
were
three
earthwomen
in
the
party
there
was
nothing
peculiar
about
them
they
were
rather
handsome
dissolute
in
appearance
all
of
them
obviously
befuddled
by
alcholite
there
was
a
man
who
could
have
been
a
wastrel
probably
with
more
money
than
wit
he
wore
a
black
dinner
suit
edged
with
white
our
attention
focussed
upon
the
other
two
they
were
tall
as
are
all
martians
the
young
woman
meka
seemed
perhaps
twenty
or
years
of
age
by
earth
reckoning
in
stature
perhaps
very
nearly
my
own
height
which
is
six
feet
two
it
is
difficult
to
tell
a
martian
age
but
she
was
very
handsome
even
by
earth
standards
and
in
she
would
be
considered
a
beauty
her
hair
was
parted
and
tied
at
the
back
with
a
plaited
metal
rope
her
short
dark
cloak
so
luminous
a
fabric
that
it
caught
and
reflected
the
sheen
of
all
the
gaudy
restaurant
lights
was
parted
its
ends
thrown
back
over
her
shoulders
beneath
it
she
wore
the
characteristic
martian
leather
jacket
and
short
wide
leather
trousers
ornamented
with
spun
metal
fringes
and
tassels
most
martian
women
have
an
amazonian
aspect
but
i
saw
now
that
meka
was
an
exception
her
brother
who
sat
beside
her
was
a
full
seven
feet
or
more
a
hulking
sort
of
fellow
far
less
spindly
than
most
of
his
race
he
might
have
come
from
the
polar
outposts
beyond
the
martian
union
he
was
his
hair
clipped
close
upon
a
round
bullet
head
with
the
familiar
martian
round
eyes
i
gazed
into
the
face
of
molo
as
momentarily
he
turned
his
head
it
was
a
strongly
masculine
face
with
a
nose
bushy
black
brows
frowning
above
deepset
round
eyes
the
face
of
a
keen
scoundrel
i
could
not
doubt
though
the
gray
skin
was
flushed
now
with
alcholite
and
the
wide
mouth
was
leering
at
the
woman
across
the
table
from
him
like
his
sister
he
had
thrown
back
his
cloak
disclosing
a
brawny
powerful
figure
leather
clad
with
a
wide
belt
of
dangling
ornaments
some
of
which
probably
were
weapons
how
long
we
gazed
at
this
silent
colored
image
of
the
restaurant
table
i
do
not
know
i
was
aware
of
halsey
quiet
voice
look
him
over
miss
venza
it
depends
on
you
another
interval
passed
it
seemed
as
we
watched
that
interest
in
his
party
was
very
slight
i
got
the
impression
too
that
though
at
first
he
had
seemed
to
be
intoxicated
actually
he
was
not
nor
was
his
sister
anxiety
seemed
upon
her
the
smile
she
had
for
jests
seemed
forced
and
at
intervals
she
would
cast
a
swift
furtive
glance
across
the
gay
restaurant
scene
more
drinks
arrived
the
earthpeople
at
the
table
here
seemed
upon
the
verge
of
stupor
and
suddenly
it
appeared
that
molo
had
completely
lost
interest
in
them
with
a
gesture
to
his
sister
he
abruptly
rose
from
his
seat
she
joined
him
they
left
the
table
and
a
floor
manager
of
the
restaurant
came
at
their
call
then
in
a
moment
they
were
moving
across
the
room
halsey
called
sharply
into
his
audiphone
francis
hold
us
to
them
if
you
can
they
were
standing
now
by
the
opened
door
of
one
of
the
red
private
insulated
rooms
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
its
interior
a
gaily
set
table
with
a
bank
of
colored
lights
over
it
the
figure
of
a
man
was
in
there
he
was
on
his
feet
as
though
he
had
just
arrived
to
meet
the
martians
here
and
a
hooded
long
cloak
enveloped
him
it
may
have
been
a
magnetic
invisible
cloak
with
the
current
now
off
we
caught
only
the
fleetest
of
impressions
before
the
insulated
door
closed
and
barred
our
vision
the
glimpse
was
an
accident
molo
taken
by
surprise
at
this
appearance
of
his
visitor
could
hardly
have
guarded
against
it
the
waiting
figure
was
very
tall
some
ten
feet
and
very
thin
the
hood
shrouded
his
face
and
head
in
his
hand
he
held
a
large
circular
box
of
black
shiny
leather
of
the
sort
in
which
women
carry
hats
as
molo
joined
him
he
put
the
box
gently
on
the
floor
he
handled
it
as
though
it
were
extraordinarily
heavy
and
as
he
took
a
step
or
two
he
seemed
weighted
down
just
as
the
room
door
was
hastily
closing
meka
sliding
it
from
the
inside
we
caught
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
horror
the
lid
of
the
hat
box
had
lifted
up
inside
was
a
great
round
thing
of
a
living
thing
a
distended
ball
of
membrane
with
a
network
of
veins
and
showing
beneath
the
transparent
skin
for
the
instant
we
gazed
stricken
the
ball
was
palpitating
breathing
i
saw
convolutions
of
inner
tissue
under
the
transparent
skin
of
membrane
a
little
tentacle
like
an
arm
with
a
hand
was
holding
up
the
lid
of
the
box
the
lid
rose
a
trifle
higher
the
colored
lights
overhead
gave
us
a
brief
but
clear
view
of
it
the
thing
in
the
box
was
a
huge
living
brain
i
saw
goggling
protruding
eyes
an
orifice
that
could
have
been
a
nose
and
a
gash
upended
for
a
vertical
mouth
it
was
a
face
and
the
little
tentacle
arm
holding
up
the
was
joined
to
where
the
ear
should
have
been
was
this
something
human
a
huge
distended
human
brain
with
the
body
withered
to
that
tiny
arm
the
palpitating
thing
sank
down
in
the
box
and
the
lid
dropped
and
upon
our
horrified
gaze
the
insulated
door
of
the
room
slid
too
by
the
gods
exclaimed
halsey
one
of
them
dares
come
to
the
red
spark
here
almost
in
public
so
halsey
knew
what
this
meant
his
eyes
were
blazing
now
his
face
was
white
with
an
intensity
of
emotion
that
transfigured
it
francis
tell
foley
i
be
in
the
manager
office
in
five
minutes
he
snapped
off
our
image
connection
with
the
red
spark
went
dead
we
going
to
the
red
spark
he
announced
this
changes
everything
yet
i
do
know
venza
i
may
need
you
more
than
ever
now
halsey
herded
us
to
the
office
door
from
his
desk
he
had
snatched
up
a
few
portable
instruments
and
he
flung
on
a
cloak
it
was
a
brief
trip
to
the
red
spark
on
foot
through
the
arcade
to
where
under
park
circle
we
went
up
in
a
vertical
lift
to
the
roof
we
were
in
the
side
entrance
oval
of
the
restaurant
in
five
minutes
in
the
dim
metal
room
of
orentino
the
red
spark
manager
a
barrage
was
up
and
foley
was
waiting
for
us
we
could
hear
it
faintly
humming
now
we
could
talk
halsey
slammed
the
door
down
he
said
swiftly
my
men
caught
one
of
these
things
this
morning
they
have
it
now
and
i
think
molo
does
not
yet
know
we
captured
it
a
brain
we
convinced
it
understands
english
and
can
talk
but
no
one
has
been
able
to
make
it
talk
yet
foley
order
that
damned
orentino
to
the
room
molo
is
in
now
by
the
gods
we
may
see
and
hear
something
the
frightened
manager
of
the
red
spark
was
in
the
control
room
halsey
killed
our
barrage
to
let
the
outside
connections
get
through
to
us
we
all
crowded
around
the
which
stood
on
desk
foley
gave
us
connection
with
the
control
room
we
saw
orentino
face
his
eyes
nearly
popping
with
fright
colonel
halsey
i
will
do
whatever
you
tell
me
what
room
is
that
martian
occupying
insulated
break
off
the
insulation
do
it
slowly
and
he
may
not
notice
then
give
us
connection
audio
and
vision
but
i
have
no
in
the
insulated
rooms
cut
off
the
barrage
i
get
connection
there
foley
was
already
setting
up
his
eavesdropper
on
the
desk
the
mirror
blurred
a
little
then
it
clarified
we
had
the
interior
of
the
secret
room
and
voices
were
coming
out
of
foley
tiny
receiver
the
image
showed
the
box
on
the
floor
with
its
lid
down
the
tall
hooded
shape
of
the
stranger
stood
with
molo
and
his
sister
by
the
table
they
were
talking
in
swift
vehement
undertones
the
language
was
martian
a
dialect
principally
used
in
our
equipment
brought
it
in
and
i
could
understand
it
molo
was
saying
but
you
are
the
fool
to
have
dared
to
come
here
the
master
knows
that
there
is
danger
something
is
wrong
the
hooded
stranger
spoke
like
a
foreigner
but
not
a
martian
nor
an
earthman
and
not
like
any
person
of
venus
i
had
ever
heard
it
was
a
strange
indescribable
intonation
a
flat
hollow
voice
i
say
the
master
is
concerned
let
him
be
and
he
demanded
i
bring
him
here
to
find
you
he
is
displeased
that
you
are
here
what
gruesome
thing
was
this
their
glances
seemed
to
go
to
the
box
on
the
floor
at
their
feet
as
though
the
master
were
in
there
but
the
lid
of
the
box
did
not
rise
well
you
have
found
me
molo
declared
impatiently
when
you
know
me
better
always
you
will
find
i
have
my
wits
the
thing
is
for
tomorrow
night
not
tonight
but
that
my
master
is
not
sure
the
hollow
voice
was
deferential
but
insistent
he
fears
danger
something
has
gone
wrong
he
is
working
on
it
now
striving
to
receive
the
message
there
is
a
message
he
knows
that
much
perhaps
from
our
world
wandl
itself
for
a
moment
molo
had
no
answer
his
sister
had
not
spoken
i
noticed
that
her
gaze
seemed
roving
the
room
what
is
it
i
should
do
molo
asked
at
last
come
with
us
to
your
but
i
have
everything
ready
there
the
contact
is
ready
for
tomorrow
night
your
world
will
control
earth
but
if
it
be
tonight
again
molo
was
silent
my
breath
stopped
on
our
mirror
i
saw
the
stranger
hood
part
just
a
little
there
seemed
to
be
no
face
just
the
blur
of
something
brownish
but
if
it
be
tonight
the
voice
insisted
i
will
go
molo
said
abruptly
but
your
coming
here
was
dangerous
suppose
we
can
not
get
out
undetected
you
know
i
will
never
go
to
where
all
our
instruments
are
set
up
and
have
some
damnable
spy
follow
me
is
all
going
well
on
venus
and
mars
yes
my
master
feels
so
he
seems
to
get
messages
the
contacts
will
be
made
simultaneously
a
gruesome
chuckle
the
capture
of
these
three
worlds
we
shall
have
all
three
enchained
at
once
helpless
the
lid
of
the
black
box
seemed
again
about
to
rise
when
there
came
a
sharp
cry
from
meka
this
room
is
not
insulated
our
eavesdropping
was
discovered
beside
me
i
heard
halsey
give
a
low
curse
on
our
mirror
we
saw
sudden
action
the
cloaked
figure
laboriously
lifted
the
black
box
and
swung
with
it
toward
the
outer
wall
of
the
room
i
saw
now
clearly
with
what
a
dragging
heavy
tread
that
giant
shape
moved
as
though
it
weighed
here
on
earth
far
more
than
the
normal
weight
to
which
it
was
accustomed
over
there
molo
gasped
the
this
room
has
one
meka
go
with
him
i
will
join
you
you
know
where
foley
cried
colonel
i
may
be
able
to
stop
them
but
halsey
saw
on
our
image
that
molo
was
staying
wait
let
them
go
if
we
have
the
martian
here
that
better
i
saw
the
room
swing
open
as
meka
and
the
hooded
shape
carrying
the
box
moved
for
it
the
moonlit
darkness
of
the
outer
catwalk
enveloped
the
disappearing
figures
molo
was
left
alone
he
closed
the
port
swiftly
his
detector
now
was
in
his
hand
but
halsey
anticipated
him
by
a
second
or
two
our
listener
went
dead
our
mirror
darkened
doubtless
molo
was
never
sure
whether
he
had
been
spied
on
or
not
halsey
was
on
his
feet
foley
get
out
into
the
main
room
stay
with
him
but
there
was
no
need
to
follow
molo
he
had
sent
his
visitor
and
sister
out
by
the
which
was
usual
enough
now
he
was
back
in
the
main
room
as
though
nothing
of
importance
had
happened
with
an
appearance
of
intoxication
about
him
he
wavered
jovially
across
the
room
threading
his
way
through
the
gay
diners
and
reached
the
table
where
his
party
still
sat
carousing
again
halsey
shut
us
off
he
got
a
base
somewhere
in
the
city
you
heard
what
they
said
about
it
we
got
to
trick
him
into
going
there
unsuspecting
halsey
seized
the
audiphone
your
chance
venza
it
the
only
way
foley

away
from
that
martian
shut
off
all
contacts

in
a
moment
i
sending
a
girl

after

only
way

can
get

all
the
wiles

no
gasped
snap
it
too
dangerous
anita
was
clinging
to
venza
colonel
halsey
i
going
too
halsey
stared
then
made
a
swift
decision
right
that
is
still
better
i
jumped
to
my
feet
colonel
i
should
prefer
that
one
of
us
men
he
gripped
me
by
the
shoulders
gregg
haljan
i
take
no
suggestions
from
you
his
blazing
eyes
bored
into
me
there
is
a
second
to
lose
do
you
realize
this
means
destruction
of
our
three
inhabited
planets
i
sacrifice
myself

or
these
girls
venza
take
anita
outside
i
join
you
immediately
give
you
last
instructions
take
a
portable
audiphone
with
you
he
turned
to
snap
this
is
the
only
way
these
demons
ca
be
forced
you
know
that
the
girls
were
moving
toward
the
door
i
met
snap
anguished
gaze
gregg
do
let
them
go
no
no
i
wo
i
made
a
lunge
past
halsey
with
snap
after
me
halsey
did
not
move
but
one
of
his
rays
struck
us
with
all
senses
numbed
i
felt
myself
falling
gregg
do
let
them
snap
had
tumbled
upon
me
my
senses
did
not
quite
fade
i
was
aware
of
anita
and
venza
horrified
cries
but
halsey
pushed
them
toward
the
door
it
slid
up
i
vaguely
saw
the
two
girls
going
out
with
halsey
after
them
and
the
door
coming
down
i
have
no
idea
how
long
it
was
before
halsey
came
back
snap
and
i
were
seated
on
a
low
metal
bench
against
the
wall
the
effect
of
the
paralysing
ray
was
wearing
off
we
were
tingling
all
over
our
senses
still
confused
halsey
stalked
in
upon
us
so
you
are
recovered
snap
stammered
we
i
say
we
sorry
as
hell
we
acted
like
that
i
know
you
are
his
voice
softened
if
i
could
have
done
anything
else
believe
me
i
would
have
but
i
do
think
harm
will
come
to
them
they
clever
are
they
outside
i
asked
did
they
find
a
way
of
meeting
the
martians
how
long
have
you
been
gone
halsey
merely
stared
at
me
as
though
he
had
no
intention
of
answering
and
then
the
audiphone
on
the
desk
buzzed
this
is
halsey
he
said
yes
i
have
them
here
bring
them
did
you
say
bring
them
we
could
not
hear
the
answering
voice
for
halsey
had
the
muffler
in
contact
no
i
would
prefer
not
to
come
i
watching
something
i
at
the
red
spark
cafe
well
i
going
back
to
my
office
presently
to
wait
there
he
continued
in
code
like
snap
i
had
never
had
occasion
to
learn
it
the
words
were
a
strange
sounding
staccato
gibberish
he
ended
i
will
send
them
grantline
very
well
i
tell
them
to
locate
him
at
once
yes
he
closed
off
the
audiphone
halsey
swung
on
us
you
all
right
now
yes
i
stood
up
drawing
snap
up
with
me
what
is
wanted
of
us
colonel
that
better
gregg
he
smiled
but
he
was
still
grim
i
wanted
you
here
to
wait
for
this
call
from
the
conclave
of
public
safety
it
met
at
midnight
they
have
ordered
both
of
you
there
that
a
secret
meeting
is
it
asked
snap
there
was
no
report
of
it
over
the
air
tonight
yes
secret
he
was
leading
us
to
the
door
they
wo
need
you
for
more
than
half
an
hour
when
they
finish
come
back
to
my
office
you
can
come
openly
he
stood
with
his
finger
on
the
door
lever
lads
foley
will
lead
you
to
the
service
room
you
are
to
take
a
mail
cylinder
for
postal
they
you
from
there
to
the
conclave
auditorium
the
door
slid
up
when
you
disembark
he
added
ask
for
johnny
grantline
you
are
to
sit
with
him
he
showed
us
out
and
the
door
slid
down
before
him
we
trudged
the
corridor
and
snap
gripped
me
for
myself
he
whispered
swiftly
i
go
to
the
damnable
conclave
because
i
ordered
but
i
wo
stay
there
long
once
we
get
out
of
it
if
i
do
route
myself
back
to
the
red
spark
i
a
i
agreed
with
him
we
had
a
mental
picture
of
anita
and
venza
in
the
red
spark
public
room
doubtless
orentino
had
created
a
way
for
them
to
meet
molo
they
would
sit
there
in
the
red
spark
with
that
drinking
party
and
in
less
than
an
hour
we
would
be
back
but
as
we
crossed
diagonally
across
an
end
of
the
main
room
with
foley
leading
us
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
molo
table
the
party
was
still
there
but
molo
anita
and
venza
were
gone
we
had
no
time
to
get
any
information
foley
abruptly
left
us
and
another
man
took
his
place
in
the
service
room
a
passenger
cylinder
was
waiting
our
guide
entered
it
with
us
at
the
switch
station
we
had
the
breath
knocked
out
of
us
after
another
ten
minutes
in
the
vacuum
tube
we
reached
our
unknown
destination
the
opened
we
found
ourselves
with
a
lone
guard
and
through
a
gloomy
arcade
opening
johnny
grantline
was
advancing
to
greet
us
well
so
here
you
are
gregg
hell
to
pay
heaven
going
on
here
come
on
in
i
tell
you
we
were
sent
for
snap
said
yes
but
they
do
want
you
yet
come
in
here
he
waved
away
the
guard
and
led
us
through
a
padded
arcade
into
a
audience
room
windowless
and
gloomy
across
it
a
doorway
panel
stood
ajar
grantline
peered
through
it
there
was
the
glow
of
light
from
the
adjoining
room
and
the
distant
murmur
of
many
voices
grantline
closed
the
door
sit
down
and
i
tell
you
where
are
we
i
asked
the
ninth
conclave
hall
i
knew
its
location
lower
manhattan
high
under
the
city
roof
grantline
produced
little
cigarette
cylinders
steady
your
nerves
lads
you
need
it
he
grinned
at
us
the
hand
with
which
he
lighted
my
cylinder
was
steady
as
a
but
he
was
excited
i
could
see
it
by
the
glint
in
his
eyes
and
hear
it
in
his
voice
what
going
on
snap
demanded
it
about
this
invading
planet
by
the
gods
when
you
hear
really
been
learned
about
it
well
what
i
asked
he
sketched
what
he
had
heard
this
night
at
the
conclave
the
mysterious
invader
was
inhabited
how
do
they
know
that
snap
put
in
wait
i
tell
you
the
rest
of
it
the
accursed
thing
changes
its
orbit
it
banks
and
turns
like
a
spaceship
it
stopped
out
in
space
it
poised
out
there
now
between
mars
and
jupiter
a
world
about
a
fifth
the
size
of
the
moon
and
the
beings
on
it
can
control
its
movements
they
brought
it
in
from
interstellar
space
into
our
solar
system
evidently
the
point
they
reached
now
is
far
as
they
want
to
come
they
poised
out
there
getting
ready
to
attack
not
only
us
but
mars
and
venus
simultaneously
grantline
gazed
at
us
through
the
smoke
of
his
cigarette
he
was
much
like
snap
small
wiry
brisk
of
movement
and
manner
but
older
his
hair
was
graying
at
the
temples
his
voice
carried
the
authority
of
one
accustomed
to
commanding
men
do
ask
me
for
the
technicalities
of
how
they
reached
these
conclusions
i
no
astronomer
i
only
telling
you
their
conclusions
and
what
their
discussions
have
been
here
for
the
past
hour
heaven
knows
we
had
no
inclination
to
dispute
him
what
we
had
seen
and
heard
at
the
red
spark
tallied
with
his
words
he
went
on
swiftly
the
attack
of
whatever
nature
it
may
be
is
impending
at
once
not
next
month
or
next
week
but
now
lord
gregg
i
do
blame
you
for
staring
like
that
you
do
know
what
been
going
on
for
the
past
two
days
on
earth
and
venus
and
mars
it
all
been
suppressed
neither
did
i
until
i
heard
it
here
tonight
the
the
martian
union
the
venus
free
state
are
all
preparing
for
war
every
government
spaceship
on
earth
is
being
commissioned
not
going
to
sit
around
and
wait
for
invaders
to
land
the
war
be
fought
on
earth
if
we
can
help
it
we
stared
snap
asked
what
makes
them
so
sure
that
war
is
coming
plenty
this
new
planet
has
sent
out
spaceships
the
planet
itself
is
hovering
sixty
million
miles
away
from
us
about
forty
million
miles
from
mars
and
close
to
ninety
million
from
venus
perhaps
its
leaders
think
that
the
most
strategic
spot
then
it
sent
out
spaceships
three
of
them
one
is
hovering
close
to
venus
another
is
near
mars
and
the
third
is
some
miles
off
earth
several
of
our
interplanetary
freighters
are
overdue
it
seems
now
that
they
must
have
encountered
these
invading
ships
and
been
destroyed
still
more
and
worse
these
three
hovering
ships
have
already
landed
the
enemy
on
mars
and
venus
the
mention
mysterious
encounters
in
and
grebhar
for
three
or
four
days
mars
has
been
in
a
panic
of
apprehension
venus
almost
as
bad
and
some
have
landed
here
not
many
perhaps
but
one
has
been
captured
a
thing
god
it
almost
beyond
description
we
could
well
agree
with
that
since
snap
and
i
had
just
seen
one
they
got
it
here
grantline
was
saying
they
tried
to
make
it
talk
they
ca
but
they
going
to
try
again
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
went
to
the
door
they
bringing
it
in
upon
his
face
was
a
look
of
awed
horror
we
stood
crowding
the
small
it
gave
onto
a
darkened
balcony
of
the
conclave
hall
the
girders
of
the
city
roof
were
over
us
there
were
a
few
official
spectators
sitting
up
here
in
the
dark
on
the
balcony
but
none
noticed
us
the
lower
floor
of
the
hall
was
lighted
around
the
polished
oblong
tables
perhaps
a
hundred
scientists
and
high
governmental
officials
of
the
three
worlds
were
seated
near
the
center
of
the
hall
was
a
small
on
a
table
there
someone
had
just
placed
a
circular
black
box
similar
to
the
one
we
had
seen
previously
the
hall
was
hushed
and
tense
on
the
dais
stood
a
group
of
earth
officials
one
of
them
spoke
here
it
is
gentlemen
and
this
time
by
god
we
make
it
speak
grantline
whispered
that
the
war
secretary
from
greater
london
i
recognized
him
brayley
commander
in
chief
of
the
land
air
water
and
space
armies
of
the
united
states
of
the
world
he
was
gigantic
in
stature
with
a
great
shock
of
hair
a
commanding
figure
if
there
ever
was
one
beside
him
nippor
the
japanese
representative
in
greater
new
york
seemed
a
pigmy
the
acoustics
of
the
silent
hall
carried
his
soft
voice
up
to
us
i
would
be
afraid
of
drugs
will
we
use
force
it
is
vital
yes
by
god
anything
it
seemed
that
everyone
in
the
hall
must
be
shuddering
i
could
feel
it
like
an
aura
pounding
up
at
me
brayley
lifted
the
reached
in
and
raised
the
horrible
thing
he
held
it
up
a
ball
of
palpitating
membrane
another
living
brain
now
damn
you
you
going
to
talk
to
us
understand
that
going
to
make
you
talk
get
that
box
out
of
the
way
they
flung
the
box
to
the
floor
and
brayley
placed
the
brain
on
the
table
a
glare
of
light
focussed
on
it
showed
beneath
the
stretched
taut
membrane
the
convolutions
of
the
brain
like
tangled
purple
worms
the
seemed
distended
almost
to
bursting
now
the
gruesome
face
with
popping
eyes
and
that
gaping
mouth
showed
a
horrible
travesty
of
terror
from
where
its
ears
should
have
been
a
crooked
little
arm
of
flabby
flesh
came
down
one
on
each
side
and
braced
the
table
and
i
saw
now
that
it
had
a
shriveled
body
or
at
least
little
legs
bent
almost
crushed
under
by
its
weight
now
damn
you
brayley
said
rubbing
off
his
hands
on
a
rough
towel
for
the
last
time
will
you
talk
the
goggling
eyes
held
a
terrified
but
baleful
gaze
upon
face
did
it
understand
the
eyes
were
fronted
our
way
and
suddenly
their
glance
swung
up
so
that
i
seemed
for
an
instant
to
see
down
into
them
and
it
struck
me
then
this
was
a
thing
of
greater
intelligence
than
my
own
a
humanoid
with
brain
so
developed
that
through
myriad
generations
the
body
was
shriveled
almost
gone
a
mind
was
housed
here
an
intelligence
housed
in
this
monstrous
brain
were
these
the
beings
of
the
new
planet
which
had
come
to
attack
us
but
how
could
this
helpless
creature
incapable
of
almost
everything
obviously
save
thought
do
the
work
of
its
world
then
i
recalled
again
that
insulated
room
of
the
red
spark
cafe
the
thin
hooded
shape
which
was
carrying
the
box
was
that
perhaps
an
opposite
type
of
being
with
the
brain
submerged
dwarfed
and
the
body
paramount
were
there
on
this
mysterious
planet
two
types
each
a
specialist
one
for
the
physical
work
and
the
other
for
the
mental
i
stood
with
snap
and
grantline
in
that
dark
balcony
doorway
gazing
down
to
where
the
giant
brain
stood
braced
upon
its
shriveled
arms
and
legs
and
realized
why
we
of
earth
and
venus
and
mars
are
all
cast
in
the
same
mould
we
call
human
it
is
a
little
family
of
planets
here
in
our
solar
system
for
countless
eons
we
have
been
close
neighbors
the
same
sunlight
the
same
general
conditions
of
life
the
same
seed
were
strewn
here
by
a
wise
creator
a
man
from
the
orient
is
different
from
an
a
man
of
mars
differs
a
little
more
but
basically
they
are
the
same
yet
confronting
us
now
was
a
new
type
from
realms
of
interstellar
space
far
beyond
our
solar
system
for
the
last
time
will
you
talk
snapped
brayley
there
was
another
interval
of
silence
the
eyes
of
the
brain
were
very
watchful
its
gaze
roved
the
hall
as
though
it
were
seeking
for
help
it
shifted
its
little
arms
on
the
table
seemingly
exhausted
from
the
physical
effort
of
supporting
itself
brayley
voice
came
again
doubtless
you
can
feel
pain
acutely
we
shall
see
with
what
effort
of
will
to
overcome
his
revulsion
we
may
only
guess
he
reached
forward
and
pinched
the
little
arm
the
result
was
electrifying
from
the
upended
slit
of
mouth
in
that
goggling
face
came
a
scream
it
pierced
the
heavy
tense
silence
of
the
hall
ghastly
in
its
timbre
like
nothing
any
of
us
had
ever
heard
before
and
in
it
was
conveyed
agony
as
though
brayley
had
not
merely
pinched
that
flabby
arm
but
had
thrust
a
knife
into
its
vitals
the
brain
could
feel
pain
indeed
it
crouched
with
stiffened
arms
and
legs
the
membrane
of
its
great
head
seemed
to
bulge
with
greater
distension
the
knotted
were
gorged
with
purple
blood
the
eyes
rolled
then
it
closed
its
mouth
its
gaze
steadied
upon
brayley
face
so
baleful
a
gaze
that
as
i
could
see
the
reflection
of
its
luminous
purple
glow
a
shudder
of
fear
and
revulsion
swept
me
so
you
did
not
like
that
brayley
steadied
his
voice
if
you
want
more
you
had
better
speak
how
did
you
get
here
on
earth
what
are
you
trying
to
do
here
there
seemed
an
interminable
silence
then
nippor
took
a
menacing
step
forward
speak
we
will
force
it
from
you
and
then
it
spoke
do
not
touch
me
again
indescribable
voice
human
animal
or
monster
no
one
could
say
but
the
words
were
clear
precise
and
for
all
their
terror
they
seemed
to
hold
an
infinite
command
a
wave
of
excitement
swept
the
hall
but
brayley
gesture
silenced
it
he
leaped
forward
and
bent
low
over
the
palpitating
brain
so
you
can
talk
you
came
as
an
enemy
we
have
given
you
every
chance
today
for
friendship
and
you
have
refused
what
are
you
trying
to
do
to
us
it
only
glared
speak
i
will
not
tell
you
anything
oh
yes
you
will
no
all
the
men
on
the
platform
were
crowding
close
to
it
now
speak
ordered
brayley
again
here
in
greater
new
york
is
a
hiding
place
where
is
it
no
answer
where
is
it
you
are
perhaps
a
leader
of
your
world
i
lead
ours
and
i
going
to
master
you
now
where
is
this
hiding
place
the
thing
suddenly
laughed
a
gruesome
eerie
cackle
you
will
know
when
it
is
too
late
i
think
it
is
too
late
already
too
late
for
what
to
save
your
world
doomed
your
three
worlds
do
touch
me
it
ended
with
a
scream
of
apprehension
as
nippor
grasped
the
crooked
little
arm
tell
us
no
it
screamed
again
let
me
go
tell
us
nippor
strengthened
his
squeezing
grip
the
thing
was
writhing
the
thin
ball
of
membrane
palpitating
heaving
and
suddenly
it
burst
over
all
its
purpled
surface
blood
came
with
a
gush
nippor
and
brayley
staggered
backward
the
scream
of
the
brain
ended
in
a
choking
gurgle
the
little
legs
and
tiny
body
wilted
under
it
the
round
ball
of
membrane
sank
to
the
table
it
rolled
sidewise
upon
one
arm
and
ear
and
in
a
moment
its
palpitation
ceased
a
mass
of
blood
it
lay
deflated
and
flabby
it
was
dead
but
see
here
i
said
did
they
mention
the
martian
molo
at
all
they
were
discussing
molo
before
you
arrived
grantline
told
us
we
had
drawn
back
from
the
doorway
the
conference
with
the
dead
thing
removed
was
proceeding
snap
and
i
had
momentarily
forgotten
anita
and
venza
but
now
we
were
in
a
panic
to
get
back
to
the
red
spark
but
you
ca
go
said
grantline
brayley
ordered
you
here
want
to
see
you
in
a
moment
well
why
does
he
see
us
now
snap
protested
i
not
going
to
cool
myself
off
sitting
here
oh
yes
you
are
grantline
sent
word
to
brayley
that
we
were
here
in
a
moment
the
answer
came
we
were
to
wait
a
short
time
he
would
want
to
see
us
we
swiftly
told
grantline
what
had
happened
at
the
red
spark
and
found
that
already
he
knew
francis
had
relayed
it
to
the
conference
and
halsey
was
in
constant
communication
with
the
officials
here
then
what
is
happening
i
demanded
where
are
the
girls
has
halsey
heard
from
them
again
grantline
went
to
a
nearby
room
anita
sent
a
message
he
said
when
he
returned
they
are
with
molo
halsey
is
ordering
a
squad
of
men
to
be
ready
grantline
told
us
what
had
been
happening
in
the
red
spark
anita
and
venza
simulating
drunkenness
with
a
skill
for
acting
which
i
knew
both
of
them
possessed
had
joined
molo
party
perhaps
if
meka
had
been
there
she
would
have
seen
through
them
but
molo
did
not
and
they
have
since
told
me
that
the
martian
himself
was
far
from
sober
although
he
was
probably
not
aware
of
it
he
yielded
to
their
demands
to
leave
the
restaurant
with
him
he
wanted
as
we
know
to
leave
unobtrusively
and
venza
threatened
a
scene
unless
she
could
go
he
took
them
leaving
openly
in
a
public
doubtless
he
at
first
intended
to
them
somewhere
but
they
convinced
him
that
he
was
not
being
followed
twice
he
used
his
detector
and
anita
and
halsey
were
clever
enough
to
throw
off
their
rays
in
time
to
avoid
it
then
halsey
lost
connection
with
the
fleeing
car
and
after
that
molo
changed
his
mind
about
ditching
the
girls
but
where
are
they
now
i
demanded
you
said
grantline
sternly
are
out
of
it
do
you
think
that
halsey
under
brayley
orders
will
neglect
any
chance
to
find
out
where
molo
is
hiding
something
is
about
to
happen
this
conference
is
wrestling
with
it
in
grebhar
and
they
striving
to
find
out
what
it
is
something
impending
helios
are
pouring
in
here
from
venus
and
mars
they
mobilizing
their
spaceships
just
as
we
are
grantline
at
last
was
letting
out
all
his
apprehensions
on
us
with
this
burst
halsey
did
tell
you
that
the
entire
resources
of
his
organization
are
out
upon
this
thing
tonight
here
at
this
conclave
there
a
room
of
that
just
where
i
came
from
a
moment
ago
every
country
on
our
earth
is
making
ready
for
what
nobody
knows
he
had
two
fragmentary
calls
from
anita
he
has
a
hundred
men
ready
to
rush
to
their
aid
and
to
capture
molo
lair
he
expects
another
message
from
anita
any
moment
this
conference
here
knows
every
movement
that
is
being
made
within
ten
or
twenty
seconds
of
its
making
perhaps
upon
anita
and
venza
the
whole
outcome
of
this
thing
may
hang
we
had
no
answer
to
that
do
you
know
who
molo
is
he
an
interplanetary
pirate
his
ship
is
the
good
lord
we
had
heard
of
him
for
five
years
past
a
gray
spaceship
with
a
base
supposedly
hidden
in
the
polar
deserts
of
mars
had
been
terrorizing
interplanetary
shipping
they
think
grantline
went
on
that
molo
was
cruising
with
his
pirate
ship
he
has
as
you
know
a
band
of
criminals
drawn
from
all
the
three
worlds
there
are
about
fifty
of
them
commanded
by
his
sister
and
himself
we
think
that
molo
encountered
the
three
ships
which
that
new
planet
sent
out
the
was
captured
perhaps
destroyed
molo
and
his
band
joined
with
this
new
enemy
to
save
themselves
and
because
they
have
been
promised
rewards
but
why
should
these
brains
want
their
help
snap
demanded
would
you
say
it
was
because
in
grebhar
and
here
in
greater
new
york
simultaneously
tonight
something
has
to
be
accomplished
something
the
brains
themselves
could
not
do
molo
and
his
band
know
all
three
cities
how
they
landed
here
in
greater
new
york
nobody
knows
the
enemy
spaceship
is
miles
out
obviously
they
came
from
it
landed
secretly
with
some
smaller
ship
somewhere
on
earth
and
made
their
way
here
a
buzzer
sounded
beside
us
a
voice
commanded
grantline
bring
gregg
haljan
and
daniel
dean
to
room
six
at
once
in
room
six
we
stood
before
the
war
secretary
who
had
arrived
there
a
moment
ahead
of
us
ah
haljan
and
dean
i
glad
to
see
you
he
was
still
white
and
shaken
beads
of
perspiration
stood
upon
his
forehead
he
mopped
them
off
i
just
had
a
rather
terrible
experience
he
did
not
suggest
that
we
sit
down
he
went
on
crisply
grantline
no
doubt
has
told
you
of
what
going
on
disturbing
terrifying
haljan
we
have
a
ship
being
rushed
into
commission
tonight
you
know
her
the
i
know
her
i
said
quite
so

about
fifty
men
grantline

in
charge
of
the
armament
and
men

dean
we
want
to
handle
her
right
said
snap
and
you
haljan
we
can
think
of
no
one
better
to
navigate
her
he
waved
away
my
appreciation
within
a
brief
time
we
shall
have
thirty
such
ships
in
space
mars
and
venus
also
are
mobilizing
he
stood
up
we
feel
haljan
that
if
anyone
can
handle
the
with
skill
enough
to
combat
this
lurking
enemy
it
will
be
you
i
do
my
best
sir
we
know
that
the
ship
is
leaving
from
the
tappan
interplanetary
stage
shortly
after
dawn
when
have
you
and
dean
last
slept
last
night

both
said
quite
so
then

good
shape

keep
out
of
this
night
activities
here
in
the
city
you
understand
yes
sir
an
orderly
was
approaching
behind
brayley
i
be
back
in
a
moment
rollins
he
shook
hands
with
us
i
may
not
see
you
again
before
it
over
good
luck
lads
grantline
they
need
you
for
a
moment
in
the
hall
something
about
electronic
space
weapons
further
equipment
for
the
then
you
better
go
to
tappan
house
too
and
get
some
sleep
we
were
dismissed
snap
and
i
regarded
each
other
hesitantly
i
said
impulsively
brayley
halsey
is
using
two
girls
yes
we
watching
that
haljan
they
the
girls
we
to
marry
i
added
may
we
communicate
with
colonel
halsey
yes
call
him
from
here
he
smiled
wanly
but
keep
out
of
it
we
need
you
at
dawn
the
tappan
was
only
a
few
miles
up
the
hudson
we
could
get
there
in
half
an
hour
it
was
now
nearly
trinight
halfway
between
midnight
and
dawn
i
had
my
portable
audiphone
and
got
halsey
at
once
you
gregg
yes
they
through
with
us
at
the
conclave
where
is
anita
we
heard
from
her
twice
i
expecting
we
could
hear
someone
interrupting
him
then
he
came
back
gregg
molo
took
them
somewhere
i
did
dare
fling
after
them
he
had
his
detector
going
and
anita
warned
me
not
to
try
it
she
had
to
stop
connection
herself
god
knows
how
she
was
able
to
whisper
to
me
at
all
his
voice
like
brayley
had
the
ring
of
a
man
strained
to
the
breaking
point
i
could
appreciate
how
halsey
must
feel
forced
to
remain
at
his
desk
with
its
encircling
banks
of
instruments
holding
all
the
network
of
his
farflung
activities
centralized
his
decisions
his
commands
in
a
hundred
places
almost
simultaneously
while
his
body
sat
there
inactive
gregg
the
girls
must
have
arrived
at
molo
place
by
now
if
only
they
know
where
they
are
i
have
lookouts
throughout
the
city
with
intricate
and
complete
connecting
equipment
gregg
i
must
disconnect
colonel
give
me
anita
frequency
maybe
snap
or
i
can
pick
up
the
message
he
named
the
oscillating
frequency
then
disconnected
try
that
frequency
snap
suggested
we
got
to
do
something
the
opened
suddenly

orderly
appeared

had
our
orders

in
the
city
wanted

the
various
publicly
displayed
throughout
the
city
in
the
hope
that

said
snap
answer
it
for
us
that
a
good
fellow

orderly
insisted

the
search
bureau
that
how
they
located
you
here
he
paid
the
highest
fee
to
search
you

emergency

against
the
law
to
invoke
the
services
of
the
search
bureau
unless
based
upon
actual
impending
danger
we
take
it
i
said
come
with
me
he
turned
to
the
left
and
down
the
corridor
we
hastened
with
him
to
a
corridor
cubby
upon
the
audiphone
there
i
was
at
once
connected
with
a
voice
and
an
anxious
man

with
a
growth
upon
it
haljan

outlines
of
the
little
public
cubby
from
which
he
was
calling
he
and
his
brother
on
some
illicit
errand
of
their
own
in
east
side
lower
manhattan
had
seen
figures
alighting
from
a
they
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
faces
of
anita
and
venza
the
girls
were
hooded
and
cloaked
a
hooded
man
was
with
them
the
quickly
rolled
away
and
the
hooded
figures
suddenly
becoming
invisible
within
their
magnetic
cloaks
had
vanished
me
we
could
do
nothin
you
know
we
take
no
chances
with
the
police
by
carryin
cylinders
so
i
paged

a
hurry

ardleys

should
be
informed
damn
right
dud
we
come
at
once
you
two
wait
for
us
sure
if
you
got
instruments
maybe
we
can
track
it
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
here
over
toward
the
river
plenty
of
rotten
dumps
down
there
wait
for
us
dud
we
come
in
a
rush
i
slammed
shut
the
audiphone
snap
beside
me
had
heard
it
all
he
shoved
the
astonished
orderly
out
of
the
way
what
the
nearest
out
of
here
to
the
city
roof
sir
up
this
incline
we
dashed
up
the
spiral
incline
through
a
low
and
were
in
the
starlight
of
the
city
roof
connect
it
gregg
you
ca
tell
her
message
might
come
over
any
minute
i
tuned
my
coils
to
the
seldom
used
oscillation
frequency
which
halsey
had
told
us
anita
transmitter
was
sending
anything
gregg
no
dead
channel
the
air
in
anita
channel
was
bafflingly
silent
we
had
been
challenged
by
a
when
we
appeared
from
the
upper
port
of
the
conclave
hall
the
city
roof
was
not
open
to
public
traffic
but
with
our
identifications
he
found
us
a
and
started
us
southward
on
the
deserted
route
it
was
a
cloudless
night
with
stars
like
diamonds
on
purple
velvet
the
city
roof
lay
glistening
in
the
starlight
in
my
time
there
had
been
no
roof
here
the
open
city
was
exposed
to
all
the
inclement
weather
but
gradually
the
arcades
and
overhead
viaducts
cross
balconies
and
catwalks
which
spanned
the
canyon
street
between
the
giant
buildings
became
a
roof
it
spread
now
terraced
and
sloped
to
top
the
lofty
buildings
like
a
great
rumpled
sheet
propped
by
the
knees
of
sleeping
giants
some
of
the
roof
was
of
opaque
alumite
dark
patches
alternating
with
the
great
glassite
panes
which
in
places
admitted
the
daylight
our
little
tram
sped
along
southward
wending
its
way
over
the
terraces
save
for
the
guards
and
lookouts
in
their
occasional
cubbies
and
the
directors
in
their
towers
we
were
alone
up
here
the
roof
was
tangled
with
conduits
aerials
arterial
systems
of
the
ventilating
and
lighting
devices
as
far
as
one
could
see
the
ventilators
stood
fronting
the
night
breeze
like
listening
ears
there
were
water
tanks
great
and
flumes
to
handle
the
rain
and
snow
a
few
traffic
towers
maintained
order
in
the
overhead
their
beacons
shot
up
into
the
sky
when
the
passing
lights
marked
the
trinight
traffic
we
were
stopped
at
intervals
but
in
each
case
were
passed
promptly
nothing
yet
gregg
no
anita
channel
remained
empty
it
was
i
suppose
no
more
than
ten
minutes
during
which
we
sped
south
along
the
grotesque
maze
of
the
roof
but
to
us
it
was
an
eternity
if
only
some
message
would
come
i
pull
up
here
yes
i
gathered
up
my
little
audiphone
thrust
it
under
my
dark
flowing
cloak
if
only
our
cloaks
were
magnetic
we
leaped
from
our
car
in
a
rush
haljan
asked
a
guard
that
us
orders
from
mr
brayley
we
left
him
and
plunged
into
a
descending
automatic
lift
a
drop
of
a
thousand
feet
we
shot
downward
past
all
the
deserted
levels
past
the
the
undersurface
transportation
lanes
the
tubes
the
down
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
city
come
on
gregg
two
segments
from
here
we
advanced
at
a
run
at
this
hour
of
night
hardly
a
pedestrian
was
in
evidence
it
was
an
arched
vaulted
corridor
almost
a
tunnel
dimly
with
short
lengths
of
fluorescent
tubes
at
intervals
on
the
ceiling
for
all
the
vaunted
mechanisms
of
our
time
the
air
here
was
heavy
and
fetid
moisture
dripped
from
the
concrete
roof
it
lay
on
the
metal
pavement
of
the
ground
the
smell
of
it
was
dank
there
were
frequent
we
turned
eastward
into
one
of
them
for
a
segment
there
were
the
lower
entrances
to
the
cellars
of
the
giant
buildings
overhead
we
passed
a
place
where
the
widened
into
a
great
underground
plaza
the
sewerage
and
lay
like
tangled
pythons
on
its
floor
half
across
it
by
the
glow
of
temporary
lights
strung
on
a
cable
a
group
of
repairmen
were
working
we
passed
them
headed
in
to
where
the
tunnel
narrowed
again
and
there
were
now
occasional
cubby
entrances
to
underground
dwellings
it
was
a
rabbit
warren
from
here
to
the
river
haunted
by
criminals
and
by
miserable
families
many
of
whom
never
saw
the
daylight
for
weeks
at
a
time
the
giant
voices
of
the
city
hardly
carried
down
here
so
that
an
oppressive
silence
hung
upon
everything
that
next
crossing
gregg
they
said
they
wait
for
us
there
occasional
escalators
led
upward
in
advance
of
us
was
a
narrow
intersection
there
were
a
few
lights
in
the
bullseyes
of
the
subterranean
dwelling
rooms
but
most
of
them
were
dark
easy
snap
not
so
fast
i
pulled
snap
to
a
walk
we
edged
over
against
the
tunnel
side
we
had
passed
a
small
lighted
audiphone
cubby
evidently
the
one
from
which
dud
and
shac
had
paged
us
they
should
have
been
here
waiting
but
there
was
nothing
but
the
empty
gloomy
tunnels
something
is
coming
snap
clutched
at
me
we
drew
our
cloaks
around
us
and
waited
in
a
shadowed
recess
down
a
side
incline
a
segment
behind
us
a
small
automatic
food
truck
came
lurching
it
pulled
up
at
an
arcade
entrance
its
driver
slid
the
portals
deposited
his
cases
of
food
locked
the
panel
after
him
and
in
a
moment
he
and
his
truck
were
gone
up
the
incline
we
heard
in
the
ensuing
silence
a
low
groan
near
at
hand
then
abruptly
it
stopped
we
saw
within
twenty
feet
of
us
two
dark
figures
lying
on
the
pavement
grid
in
a
black
patch
of
shadow
where
the
mailtube
came
down
in
a
curve
and
disappeared
into
the
tunnel
wall
we
bent
over
the
figures
of
two
men
they
lay
together
one
half
upon
the
other
figures
with
white
staring
faces
one
twitched
a
little
and
then
lay
still
they
were
shac
and
dud
ardley
murdered
gregg
good
lord
both
were
dead
but
we
could
see
no
marks
on
either
of
them
i
found
my
wits
snap
we
ca
stand
like
this
wholly
visible
i
pulled
snap
away
we
darted
a
few
feet
the
light
of
the
tunnel
intersection
was
directly
over
us
not
here
snap
run
under
the
curving
vacuum
tube
a
little
further
along
we
found
shelter
snap
murmured
the
girls
went
past
here
but
which
way
gregg
as
though
i
knew
i
felt
at
that
moment
under
the
shirt
against
my
skin
the
anode
of
my
audiphone
tingling
a
receiving
signal
in
the
gloom
i
could
see
snap
white
face
as
he
watched
me
bring
it
out
we
heard
a
tiny
microphonic
voice
anita
voice
colonel
halsey
yes

have
the
location
lafayette
east
corridor
lowest
level
a
descending
entrance
do

minute
venza

but
send

a
strange
mechanism
here
then
halsey
interrupting
voice

and
venza
we
ca
they

us
i
sending
men
they

there
in
ten
minutes
ten
minutes
will
be
too
late
molo
is
it
seemed
that
we
heard
her
scream
then
the
waves
blurred
and
died
lafayette
east
corridor
lowest
level
snap
that
here
a
descending
entrance
we
stood
back
against
the
great
curving
side
of
the
postal
vacuum
tube
within
it
i
heard
the
hiss
and
clank
as
a
mail
cylinder
flashed
past
halsey
secret
orders
must
be
going
out
now
his
men
nearest
this
place
would
come
in
a
rush
but
anita
said
that
would
be
too
late
snap
and
i
were
frantically
searching
somewhere
here
was
an
entrance
to
molo
lair
it
seemed
in
the
silence
that
anita
scream
was
still
ringing
in
my
ears
had
it
been
entirely
from
the
instrument
or
were
we
so
close
that
we
had
heard
its
distant
echoes
gregg
help
me
snap
was
tugging
at
a
horizontal
like
a
trap
in
the
tunnel
floor
partly
under
the
vacuum
tube
stuck
he
gasped
it
yielded
with
our
efforts
it
slid
aside
steps
led
downward
into
blackness
we
plunged
in
caution
gone
from
us
the
steps
went
down
some
twenty
feet
we
were
in
another
smaller
corridor
it
was
vaguely
lighted
by
a
glow
from
somewhere
and
as
my
pupils
expanded
i
could
see
this
was
a
shabby
alley
opening
ahead
into
a
winding
passage
with
the
above
us
like
its
back
gate
a
warren
of
cubbies
was
here
a
little
sequestered
segment
of
disreputable
dwellings
we
stood
peering
listening
shall
i
try
the
eavesdropper
gregg
yes
no
wait
i
thought
i
heard
distant
sounds
voices
snap
listen
more
than
voices
a
thud
footsteps
running
a
commotion
back
in
this
warren
within
a
hundred
feet
of
us
this
way
i
murmured
we
plunged
into
a
black
gash
there
was
a
glow
of
light
a
glassite
pane
in
a
house
wall
nearby
the
commotion
was
louder
and
under
it
now
we
heard
a
vague
humming
something
electrical
it
was
an
indescribably
weird
sound
like
nothing
i
had
ever
heard
before
snap
clutched
at
me
in
here
but
where
is
the
accursed
door
there
was
a
glassite
pane
but
we
could
find
no
door
in
our
hands
we
held
small
electronic
weapons
the
hum
and
hissing
was
louder
it
seemed
to
throb
within
us
as
though
vibration
were
communicating
to
every
fiber
of
our
bodies
light
was
streaming
through
the
glassite
pane
and
we
glimpsed
the
interior
of
the
room
the
light
now
came
from
a
strange
mechanism
set
in
the
center
of
the
metal
cubby
i
caught
only
an
instant
glimpse
of
it
a
round
thing
of
coils
and
wires
the
metal
floor
of
the
room
was
cut
away
exposing
the
gray
rock
of
manhattan
island
and
against
the
rock
in
a
circle
a
series
of
discs
were
contacted
with
wires
leading
from
them
to
the
central
coils
the
whole
was
glowing
with
opalescent
light
it
was
dazzling
blinding
within
in
it
the
goggled
figure
of
molo
was
moving
adjusting
the
contacts
he
stooped
he
straightened
drew
back
from
the
light
only
an
instant
glimpse
but
we
saw
the
girls
crouching
with
black
bandages
on
their
eyes
meka
goggled
like
her
brother
was
holding
them
a
tall
shape
carrying
a
round
black
box
darted
through
the
light
and
ran
molo
leaped
for
the
girls
the
hum
had
mounted
to
a
wild
electrical
scream
molo
flung
his
sister
back
out
of
the
light
they
all
vanished
there
was
nothing
but
the
light
and
the
mounting
dynamic
scream
beside
me
snap
was
pounding
on
the
glassite
panel
i
joined
him
everything
was
dreamlike
blurring
as
though
unconsciousness
was
upon
me
where
was
snap
gone
then
i
saw
him
nearby
he
had
found
a
door
but
it
would
yield
i
saw
his
arm
go
up
in
a
gesture
to
me
he
ran
i
found
myself
running
after
him
but
i
stumbled
and
fell
then
over
me
the
scream
burst
into
a
great
roar
of
sound
it
seemed
so
intense
so
gigantic
a
sound
that
it
must
ring
around
the
world
and
the
light
burst
with
an
exploding
puff
the
black
metal
cubby
walls
seemed
to
melt
like
phantoms
in
a
dream
a
titan
blowtorch
the
opalescent
light
shot
upward
a
circular
beam
eating
its
way
through
all
the
city
levels
as
though
they
were
paper
up
through
the
city
roof
molo
cubby
was
gone
his
mechanism
was
eaten
by
the
light
and
destroyed
there
was
only
this
motionless
upstanding
beam
contacted
here
with
the
earth
streaming
like
an
opalescent
sword
into
the
starry
sky
i
must
paint
now
upon
a
broader
canvas
to
depict
the
utter
chaos
of
this
most
memorable
night
in
the
history
of
the
earth
venus
and
mars
from
that
point
in
the
bowels
of
greater
new
york
near
the
southern
tip
of
manhattan
island
the
mysterious
shot
up
it
screamed
with
its
weird
electrical
voice
for
an
hour
so
penetrating
a
sound
that
it
was
heard
with
the
unaided
ears
as
far
away
as
philadelphia
a
titan
voice
it
was
shrill
as
if
with
triumph
there
were
millions
of
people
awakened
by
it
this
night
awakened
and
struck
with
a
chill
of
fear
at
this
nameless
siren
shrilling
its
note
of
danger
the
sound
gradually
subsided
it
seemed
to
reach
its
peak
within
a
few
minutes
of
the
appearance
of
the
light
and
within
an
hour
it
had
ceased
but
the
light
beam
remained
those
who
inspected
it
closely
have
given
a
clear
description
of
its
aspect
but
to
this
day
its
real
nature
has
never
been
determined
it
was
a
circular
beam
of
about
a
diameter
in
color
it
was
vaguely
opalescent
rather
more
brilliant
at
night
than
in
the
day
with
the
coming
of
the
sun
it
did
not
fade
but
remained
clearly
visible
with
a
spectrum
sheen
when
the
sunlight
hit
it
so
that
it
had
somewhat
the
appearance
of
a
titanic
straightened
rainbow
from
that
contact
point
with
our
earth
the
inexplicable
beam
stood
vertically
upward
it
ate
a
vertical
hole
like
a
chimney
up
through
all
the
city
levels
through
the
roof
and
into
the
sky
it
had
a
tremendous
heat
communicable
by
contact
so
that
it
melted
the
city
above
it
with
a
clean
round
hole
but
the
heat
was
i
was
found
lying
within
fifty
feet
of
the
base
of
the
beam
there
had
been
an
explosion
so
that
molo
metal
room
was
gone
but
from
where
i
lay
there
was
only
a
warmth
to
be
felt
from
the
light
halsey
men
found
me
within
half
an
hour
i
was
unconscious
but
not
injured
i
think
now
that
the
sound
and
not
the
light
overcame
me
i
presently
recovered
consciousness
for
another
hour
i
was
blind
and
deaf
but
that
quickly
wore
off
they
rushed
me
through
the
chaos
of
the
city
to
the
tappan
headquarters
grantline
was
there
but
not
snap
i
sent
them
back
when
once
i
was
fully
conscious
they
searched
all
the
vicinity
at
the
base
of
the
light
snap
alive
or
dead
was
not
to
be
found
anita
and
venza
were
gone
i
had
seen
molo
and
meka
plunge
away
with
them
as
the
burst
forth
they
were
gone
and
snap
was
gone
there
was
by
now
a
turmoil
unprecedented
throughout
all
the
metropolitan
area
the
motionless
itself
had
done
little
damage
but
its
appearance
brought
instant
chaos
within
a
radius
of
five
miles
of
its
base
the
city
was
plunged
into
darkness
all
power
was
cut
off
every
vehicle
even
the
aeros
passing
overhead
and
the
ventilating
system
stopped
audiphones
were
wrecked
it
subsided
within
an
hour
though
and
after
that
lights
and
instruments
brought
into
the
area
were
not
affected
but
during
that
hour
south
manhattan
was
in
panic
a
multitude
of
terrified
people
awakened
in
the
night
to
find
blackness
and
that
screaming
sound
the
streets
and
corridors
and
traffic
levels
were
jammed
with
throngs
trampling
and
killing
one
another
in
their
efforts
to
escape
this
was
in
the
stricken
area
but
everywhere
else
the
panic
was
spreading
transportation
systems
were
almost
all
out
of
commission
the
panic
spread
until
by
dawn
there
was
a
wild
exodus
of
refugees
jamming
the
bridges
and
viaducts
and
tunnels
streaming
from
all
the
city
exits
this
was
greater
new
york
but
from
venus
and
mars
came
similar
reports
in
grebhar
and
in
doubtless
almost
simultaneous
with
greater
new
york
similar
appeared
but
what
can
it
be
i
demanded
of
grantline
something
molo
contacted
there
he
did
it
that
was
what
he
was
working
for
and
he
accomplished
his
purpose
but
what
will
the
beam
do
to
us
it
doing
plenty
said
grantline
grimly
he
did
intend
that
there
was
something
else
but
what
as
yet
no
one
knew
i
had
already
told
the
authorities
what
i
had
seen
i
was
the
only
to
molo
activities
and
heaven
knows
i
had
but
a
brief
confused
glimpse
the
beam
remained
it
streamed
upward
from
the
rock
they
thought
this
night
that
molo
strange
current
had
set
up
a
disintegration
of
the
atoms
and
that
electronic
particles
from
them
were
streaming
into
space
the
seemed
impervious
to
attack
within
a
few
hours
the
authorities
were
attacking
its
base
with
various
vibratory
weapons
but
without
success
from
where
grantline
and
i
sat
we
saw
the
dawn
coming
but
the
remained
unaffected
gregg
look
there
at
venus
to
the
east
of
us
there
was
a
distant
line
of
metal
structures
surmounting
the
hills
above
them
in
the
brightening
sky
of
dawn
venus
was
just
rising
mars
had
already
set
at
our
longitude
venus
fairly
close
to
the
earth
now
was
the
morning
star
it
mounted
now
above
that
line
of
metal
stages
in
the
distance
and
as
grantline
gestured
i
saw
from
venus
the
same
beam
streaming
off
almost
to
cross
our
own
grantline
and
i
with
a
mutual
thought
ran
around
the
balcony
and
gazed
to
where
mars
had
set
a
narrow
radiance
was
streaming
up
among
the
stars
off
there
three
swinging
swords
of
light
in
the
sky
with
the
rotation
of
the
planets
they
swept
the
firmament
the
mysterious
enemy
had
planted
them
but
why
what
was
coming
next
and
as
though
to
answer
us
from
far
to
the
south
over
came
a
new
manifestation
we
saw
a
speck
rising
a
distant
mounting
speck
of
something
dark
with
streamers
of
tiny
radiance
flowing
from
it
a
spaceship
gregg
it
seemed
so
it
came
slowly
from
above
the
maze
of
distant
structures
gathered
speed
and
in
a
moment
was
gone
but
others
better
equipped
had
observed
it
it
was
a
cylindrical
projectile
with
propelling
it
upward
an
unusual
form
of
spaceship
telescopically
it
was
seen
until
well
after
dawn
speeding
out
in
the
direction
of
the
moon
molo
and
his
weird
allies
had
escaped
i
thought
with
their
work
done
here
on
earth
they
were
off
to
rejoin
the
hovering
enemy
ship
miles
out
i
stood
gripping
grantline
on
that
balcony
and
gazed
with
sinking
heart
were
anita
and
venza
prisoners
on
that
mounting
ship
and
snap
i
prayed
he
was
there
with
the
girls
to
lend
them
the
protection
i
had
failed
to
give
haljan
and
grantline
wanted
below
the
voice
of
a
mechanic
on
the
balcony
behind
us
roused
us
from
our
thoughts
we
went
down
through
the
busy
building
the
workshops
of
tappan
interplanetary
headquarters
had
for
hours
been
ringing
with
busy
activity
the
rested
upon
her
departure
stage
outside
with
a
score
of
workmen
conditioning
her
additional
armament
was
aboard
ready
to
be
assembled
after
the
start
the
men
to
handle
it
were
embarked
my
half
dozen
officers
and
the
ten
members
of
the
crew
i
had
already
briefly
met
they
were
waiting
for
me
on
we
go
gregg
let
wish
ourselves
luck
from
grim
silent
abstraction
grantline
had
now
sprung
into
his
familiar
dynamic
self
there
was
a
solemn
group
of
officers
and
a
hundred
or
so
workmen
here
they
stopped
their
fevered
labors
now
to
watch
the
get
away
first
of
earth
ships
speeding
into
space
to
confront
this
nameless
enemy
grantline
and
i
went
past
them
with
silent
handshakes
and
murmured
i
saw
the
towering
figure
of
brayley
he
raised
an
arm
for
a
farewell
gesture
to
us
we
mounted
the
incline
to
the
she
rested
upon
her
stage
a
great
sleek
bronze
ship
low
and
rakish
with
pointed
ends
and
a
flattened
arched
dome
of
glassite
covering
the
superstructure
and
the
decks
from
bow
to
stern
she
lay
quiescent
gleaming
in
the
glow
of
the
departure
beacons
but
there
was
an
aspect
of
latent
power
upon
her
my
ship
my
first
command
as
we
went
through
the
opened
port
of
the
domeside
and
i
touched
foot
upon
the
deck
i
prayed
that
i
might
justify
the
faith
reposed
in
me
men
crowded
the
narrow
covered
deck
i
saw
the
at
the
deck
partly
assembled
my
chief
officer
a
young
fellow
named
drac
davidson
who
with
his
twin
brother
had
been
in
the
interplanetary
freight
service
rushed
up
to
me
we
ready
sir
very
good
drac
he
hurried
me
to
the
turret
control
room
grantline
instantly
had
plunged
into
details
of
assembling
the
weapons
her
ports
are
all
closed
said
drac
he
spoke
calmly
but
his
thin
face
was
pale
and
his
dark
eyes
glowed
with
excitement
the
interior
pressure
is
set
at
fifteen
pounds
you
can
ring
us
up
at
once
no
formalities
to
this
departure
with
pounding
heart
i
entered
the
small
circular
turret
and
mounted
its
tiny
spiral
stairs
to
the
upper
control
room
but
as
i
touched
the
levers
calmness
came
to
me
with
these
familiar
tasks
at
which
i
was
skilled
i
slid
a
it
went
smoothly
perfectly
operated
by
the
magnets
the
vessel
trembled
lifted
outside
the
enclosing
dome
i
could
see
the
of
the
sky
and
paling
floodlights
of
the
stage
figures
of
men
out
there
made
silent
gestures
of
farewell
dropping
slowly
beneath
our
hull
as
we
lifted
the
bow
slid
into
the
positions
the
bow
lifted
the
responded
smoothly
we
went
up
poised
at
a
degree
angle
i
saw
the
outer
beacons
on
the
stage
swing
upward
with
their
warning
to
passing
traffic
in
the
lower
lanes
light
our
drac
we
lifted
through
the
lower
thousand
and
two
lanes
the
lights
of
tappen
were
dwindling
beneath
us
the
interior
of
the
was
humming
with
the
whirr
of
its
circulators
and
mingled
with
the
throb
of
air
pressure
pumps
at
three
thousand
feet
i
started
the
engines
they
came
on
with
a
gentle
purring
the
fluorescence
from
them
streamed
along
our
hull
and
down
past
the
stern
like
twin
rocket
tails
with
gathering
speed
we
slid
smoothly
upward
through
the
highest
traffic
lanes
out
of
the
atmosphere
through
the
stratosphere
and
into
space
leaving
the
stratosphere
i
cut
off
the
engines
slid
the
stern
for
the
earth
repulsion
and
the
bow
plates
for
the
attraction
of
the
moon
and
sun
the
firmament
swung
in
a
slow
arc
and
steadied
with
the
earth
behind
us
and
the
sun
and
moon
in
advance
of
our
bow
we
were
on
our
course
plunging
through
space
with
accelerating
velocity
toward
the
unknown
enemy
ship
hovering
two
hundred
thousand
miles
ahead
of
us
my
orders
were
to
find
the
ship
and
maneuver
us
close
to
it
and
grantline
orders
were
to
assail
it
i
gazed
down
at
the
convex
north
atlantic
with
the
reddening
coastline
of
north
america
spread
like
a
map
what
was
the
nature
of
this
strange
enemy
whom
we
sought
that
opalescent
beam
from
greater
new
york
mounted
with
its
radiance
into
the
starfield
the
one
from
venus
and
the
other
from
mars
seemed
crossing
overhead
amid
the
stars
three
swords
crossing
the
sky
what
did
they
mean
will
you
swing
east
or
west
of
the
moon
we
have
decided
drac
davidson
and
i
were
alone
in
the
control
turret
we
were
some
ten
hours
out
from
earth
over
such
short
astronomical
distances
it
was
impossible
to
attain
any
great
velocity
when
once
we
were
clear
of
the
earth
atmospheric
envelope
the
engines
were
useless
the
was
equipped
also
with
of
electronic
nature
they
exerted
a
slight
pressure
useful
for
sudden
curving
and
turning
but
they
had
only
negligible
influence
upon
the
main
velocity
of
the
vehicle
i
used
the
repulsion
of
the
earth
upon
our
negatively
charged
stern
and
with
those
of
the
bow
electronified
to
the
positive
reaction
we
were
drawn
forward
by
the
sun
and
the
moon
for
three
or
four
hours
i
held
to
this
combination
with
steady
acceleration
but
then
i
had
to
retard
in
close
quarters
such
as
this
the
retarding
velocity
must
be
calculated
with
a
nicety
many
hours
in
advance
we
hung
now
very
nearly
poised
within
some
forty
thousand
miles
of
the
surface
of
the
moon
bleak
and
cold
sharply
black
and
white
it
hung
in
a
gigantic
crescent
in
advance
of
our
bow
the
sun
whose
attraction
i
had
ceased
using
some
hours
back
was
visible
sharply
to
one
side
now
its
great
gas
streams
of
giant
flame
licked
up
into
the
blackness
of
the
firmament
the
sunlight
caught
the
lunar
mountains
with
a
white
glare
and
left
the
valleys
black
with
shadow
moonlight
and
the
mingled
sunlight
painted
our
bow
behind
our
stem
the
great
disk
of
earth
hung
somber
and
glowing
and
everywhere
else
was
the
great
black
enclosing
firmament
the
stars
blazed
with
a
new
white
glory
never
seen
through
the
haze
of
an
atmosphere
like
a
little
world
in
the
vastness
of
this
awesome
void
we
hung
poised
grantline
came
into
the
turret
i
got
everything
ready
gregg
by
the
gods
once
you
can
lay
telescope
upon
that
accursed
enemy
ship
i
ready
to
open
fire
on
it
good
i
said
but
the
thought
of
hurling
our
bolts
at
this
enemy
ship
had
struck
terror
into
my
heart
for
hours
past
i
was
convinced
that
the
three
who
in
all
the
world
were
dearest
to
me
anita
venza
and
snap
were
upon
that
enemy
vessel
grantline
asked
are
you
going
closer
to
the
moon
no
the
ship
could
be
between
us
and
the
moon
waters
and
i
have
been
in
the
helio
room
for
the
past
hour
searching
with
the
there
nothing
doing
gregg
not
a
sign
i
know
our
instruments
here
show
that
there
might
be
a
way
of
sighting
them
drac
put
in
i
try
the
i
suggested
drac
and
i
have
it
corrected
but
i
doubt
if
it
would
penetrate
the
sort
of
invisibility
this
enemy
would
use
grantline
nodded
or
the
benson
you
think
the
ship
went
behind
the
moon
or
landed
on
the
moon
it
could
have
done
either
has
waters
still
got
contact
with
the
earth
have
they
seen
it
no
i
made
a
sudden
decision
it
would
take
us
two
hours
at
least
to
make
a
careful
scanning
with
the
and
to
take
an
elaborate
series
of
of
the
moon
surface
which
might
show
the
enemy
vessel
if
it
had
landed
there
was
a
laborious
process
after
brief
thought
i
discarded
the
idea
we
go
to
the
helio
room
i
told
grantline
i
going
to
try
the
benson
grantline
and
i
left
the
turret
heading
along
the
catwalk
under
the
glassite
dome
toward
the
helio
cubby
where
the
rotund
waters
was
in
charge
it
made
my
heart
sink
to
think
of
the
helio
room
snap
should
have
been
there
we
crossed
the
transverse
catwalk
the
superstructure
roof
was
under
us
farther
down
the
narrow
decks
showed
with
grantline
men
grouped
at
the
firing
ports
where
his
weapons
were
mounted
and
ready
as
i
saw
those
grouped
men
loitering
on
the
deck
waiting
for
me
to
give
them
a
sighting
i
prayed
i
could
do
so
and
yet
there
was
the
shuddering
fear
that
the
first
blast
would
bring
death
to
anita
waters
met
us
at
the
door
of
his
cubby
his
face
was
red
he
mopped
the
perspiration
from
his
bald
head
i
so
glad
you
came
will
you
want
the
i
say
i
lost
connection
with
the
earth
i
had
the
washington
transmitter
five
minutes
ago
they
sent
me
a
flash
of
the
mars
and
venus
news
they
both
sent
ships
out
he
gasped
for
breath
then
added
in
a
rush
both
the
mars
and
venus
ships
were
destroyed
and
the
enemy
escaped
grantline
and
i
gasped
with
horror
destroyed
i
said
how
waters
did
not
know
the
news
came
then
immediately
after
the
washington
transmitter
changed
its
wavelength
and
he
lost
connection
but
why
in
heaven
name
man
did
you
ring
and
tell
us
grantline
demanded
destroyed
only
that
just
destroyed
i
was
afraid
to
leave
my
instruments
waters
said
how
could
i
tell
i
might
be
able
to
renew
connections
with
washington
any
minute
come
on
in
do
you
want
to
try
the
benson
mr
haljan
yes
i
said
i
do
we
entered
the
dim
helio
cubby
see
here
waters
what
about
the
projectile
that
ascended
from
earth
last
night
did
the
washington
observatory
report
what
happened
to
it
no
not
a
word
they
lost
it
evidently
our
on
the
had
not
been
able
to
locate
the
projectile
the
large
instruments
of
earth
had
lost
it
was
that
because
with
tremendous
velocity
it
had
sped
directly
for
the
new
planet
out
beyond
mars
or
with
some
form
of
invisibility
might
it
be
close
to
us
now
just
as
the
lurking
ship
might
be
somewhere
around
here
from
the
little
circular
helio
cubby
perched
here
under
the
dome
like
an
eagle
nest
i
could
see
down
all
the
length
of
the
ship
and
out
the
side
ports
of
the
dome
to
the
blazing
firmament
the
sun
moon
and
earth
and
all
the
starfield
were
silently
turning
as
drac
swung
us
upon
our
new
course
waters
bent
over
the
projector
of
the
benson
making
connections
the
cubby
was
silent
and
dim
with
only
a
tiny
spotlight
where
waters
was
working
and
a
glow
upon
his
table
where
his
recent
messages
from
earth
were
filed
grantline
and
i
glanced
at
them
panic
in
greater
new
york
grebhar
and
the
three
strange
beams
which
the
enemy
had
planted
on
earth
venus
and
mars
still
remained
unchanged
i
could
see
them
now
plainly
from
the
helio
cubby
windows
great
shafts
of
radiance
sweeping
the
firmament
waters
straightened
from
his
task
that
will
do
it
mr
haljan
he
met
me
in
the
center
of
the
cubby
when
you
locate
the
enemy
do
you
think
they
destroy
us
as
they
did
those
other
ships
grantline
laughed
grimly
maybe
so
waters
but
let
hope
not
fat
little
waters
was
anything
but
a
coward
but
being
closed
up
here
all
these
hours
with
a
stream
of
dire
messages
from
earth
had
shaken
him
what
i
mean
grantline
is
that
prudence
is
sometimes
better
than
reckless
valor
the
is
no
warship
if
earth
had
sent
an
international
patrol
vessel
grantline
did
not
answer
he
joined
me
at
the
benson
projector
can
we
operate
it
from
here
gregg
or
will
you
mount
it
in
the
bow
from
here
drac
swinging
when
he
on
the
course
i
gave
him
i
can
throw
the
through
the
bow
waters
you
all
done
in
go
below
and
sleep
awhile
but
he
stood
his
ground
no
sir
i
do
want
to
sleep
we
had
ours
said
grantline
we
call
you
if
anything
shows
up
we
sent
waters
away
ready
gregg
yes
i
got
the
range
the
coils
hummed
and
heated
with
the
current
and
in
a
moment
the
benson
leaped
from
the
projector
the
benson
was
similar
to
an
ordinary
white
searchlight
beam
except
that
its
path
instead
of
being
straight
could
be
bent
at
will
into
various
curves
hyperbola
parabola
and
for
its
extreme
curve
the
segment
of
an
ellipse
gradually
straightening
as
it
left
its
source
it
was
effective
for
police
work
with
hand
torches
for
seeing
around
opaque
obstructions
it
had
also
another
advantage
especially
when
used
at
long
range
the
enemy
when
gazing
back
at
its
source
would
under
normal
circumstances
conceive
it
to
be
a
straight
beam
and
thus
be
misled
as
to
the
location
of
its
source
or
even
realizing
it
to
be
curved
one
had
no
means
of
judging
the
angle
of
the
curve
a
narrow
white
stream
of
light
it
flung
through
our
forward
under
the
dome
and
through
the
bow
dome
bullseye
into
space
i
saw
the
men
on
the
deck
spring
into
sudden
alertness
with
the
realization
we
were
using
it
the
bow
lookout
on
the
forward
observation
bridge
crouched
at
his
to
help
us
search
from
the
control
turret
came
an
audiphone
buzz
and
drac
voice
am
i
headed
right
the
swing
is
almost
completed
finish
the
job
and
do
bother
me
now
i
bent
over
the
of
the
projector
on
its
glowing
grid
the
shifting
image
of
my
range
was
visible
a
curving
brilliant
limb
of
the
moon
with
the
sunlight
on
the
jagged
mountain
peaks
everywhere
else
was
the
black
firmament
and
the
blazing
dots
of
stars
grantline
crouched
beside
me
i
work
the
amplifiers
going
to
spread
it
much
gregg
yes
a
full
spread
first
we
in
no
mood
for
a
detailed
narrow
search
i
gradually
widened
the
light
three
feet
here
at
its
source
it
spread
in
a
great
widening
arc
with
the
naked
eye
we
could
see
its
white
radiance
as
an
edge
of
it
fell
upon
the
moon
and
though
optically
it
was
not
apparent
the
elliptical
curve
of
it
was
rounding
the
moon
disclosing
the
hidden
starfield
to
our
instruments
nothing
yet
i
murmured
no
i
try
a
narrower
spread
and
less
curve
grantline
was
searching
the
magnified
images
on
the
series
of
amplifier
grids
there
was
nothing
for
an
hour
we
worked
then
suddenly
grantline
cried
gregg
wait
hold
it
i
tensed
stricken
i
held
the
angle
and
the
spread
of
light
steady
two
seconds
of
arc
east
try
that
the
damned
thing
is
shifting
he
gripped
me
it
at
the
eastern
edge
of
the
field
it
shifts
off
it
must
be
in
rapid
motion
then
i
saw
it
a
mere
moving
dot
of
black
but
suddenly
it
clarified
i
saw
a
dot
which
i
could
imagine
was
a
shape
with
discs
along
its
edge
moving
with
high
velocity
grantline
was
shifting
our
field
to
hold
it
got
it
gregg
by
god
that
it
now
we
see
then
presently
we
saw
that
from
its
bow
a
very
faint
radiant
beam
was
streaming
beside
me
i
heard
grantline
gasp
gregg
am
i
crazy
or
is
that
bow
beacon
like
the
planted
in
greater
new
york
there
did
seem
to
be
a
similarity
but
thought
of
it
abruptly
was
swept
from
my
mind
our
cubby
was
alive
with
signals
both
the
bow
and
the
stern
observers
saw
the
enemy
ship
now
with
their
gazing
directly
along
our
and
drac
was
calling
i
got
the
measurement
of
its
velocity
doubling
every
ten
seconds
god
what
acceleration
i
flung
off
the
the
enemy
ship
had
come
from
behind
the
limb
of
the
moon
our
telescopes
showed
it
clearly
it
was
heading
unmistakably
in
our
direction
drac
was
pleading
we
need
velocity
are
you
coming
to
the
turret
yes
grantline
and
i
rushed
out
upon
the
catwalk
waters
was
mounting
the
spiral
ladder
from
the
deck
into
your
cubby
i
shouted
call
earth
keep
calling
until
you
get
them
grantline
rushed
for
the
deck
i
gained
the
control
turret
drac
with
his
thin
face
white
and
set
met
me
at
the
door
we
need
velocity
i
nodded
we
get
it
drac
have
no
fear
of
that
i
set
the
for
the
greatest
possible
acceleration
forward
and
added
the
stern
rocket
engines
for
maneuvering
with
gathering
speed
we
plunged
directly
for
the
oncoming
enemy
ship
but
there
something
wrong
drac
we
got
grade
five
acceleration
grantline
had
joined
us
in
the
control
turret
how
far
would
you
say
at
a
rough
guess
that
ship
is
from
us
now
thirty
thousand
miles
about
that
drac
scanned
his
page
of
calculations
impossible
to
gauge
with
any
exactness
they
change
their
pace
so
often
and
i
ca
figure
out
how
large
the
damn
thing
is
say
they
got
a
forty
thousand
velocity
added
to
our
ten
fifty
and
we
accelerating
in
half
an
hour
we
be
within
range
but
there
something
wrong
i
persisted
for
several
minutes
now
i
had
been
aware
that
the
was
acting
strangely
a
sluggish
response
to
the
controls
i
thought
but
when
i
called
engine
chief
franklin
he
had
not
noticed
it
yet
i
was
certain
grantline
stared
at
me
something
wrong
yes
drac
try
orienting
us
i
did
it
ten
minutes
ago
i
shoved
him
at
my
equations
giving
the
angles
with
the
sun
earth
and
moon
which
we
should
now
have
there
our
flight
course
as
it
ought
to
be
measure
how
we
heading
actual
position
if
it
what
it
ought
to
be
with
the
i
using
then
i
crazy
oh
you
just
naturally
apprehensive
grantline
said
but
we
were
not
where
we
should
be
the
was
off
her
predetermined
course
and
then
i
realized
the
factor
of
error
there
was
a
gravitational
force
here
for
which
i
was
not
allowing
the
error
was
not
within
the
she
was
responding
perfectly
but
there
was
a
force
upon
her
and
not
that
of
the
sun
earth
moon
or
the
distant
starfield
i
had
calculated
all
of
these
it
was
something
else
some
gravitational
pull
so
that
we
were
not
upon
the
course
of
flight
we
should
have
been
on
but
what
could
be
wrong
grantline
demanded
it
was
drac
who
guessed
it
that
radiance
from
the
enemy
bow
it
was
that
we
felt
certain
even
at
this
thirty
thousand
mile
distance
the
seemed
streaming
upon
us
we
could
not
see
that
it
illumined
the
nor
could
our
instruments
measure
any
added
illumination
our
if
held
would
carry
us
with
a
swing
some
ten
thousand
miles
above
the
south
pole
of
the
moon
it
would
cross
diagonally
in
front
of
the
trajectory
that
the
enemy
vessel
was
maintaining
but
we
were
off
our
predetermined
course
with
a
toward
the
enemy
that
radiance
was
exerting
a
force
upon
us
a
strange
gravitational
pull
grantline
gasped
when
drac
said
it
if
it
that
now
what
will
it
be
when
we
get
closer
the
minutes
were
passing
the
thirty
thousand
miles
between
us
and
the
enemy
was
cut
to
ten
thousand
to
five
the
ship
was
soon
visible
to
the
naked
eye
its
visual
movement
for
all
this
time
measurable
only
as
a
drift
upon
the
amplified
images
of
our
instruments
now
was
obvious
we
could
see
it
plunging
forward
could
see
that
probably
we
would
cross
its
bow
within
fifty
miles
we
hoped
and
guessed
that
would
be
the
result
so
that
with
this
first
passing
we
could
use
our
weapons
fifty
miles
of
distance
at
combined
speeds
of
some
fifty
thousand
miles
an
hour
that
would
be
something
like
three
seconds
from
a
collision
the
danger
of
a
collision
which
both
ships
would
do
anything
to
avert
was
negligible
in
the
immensity
of
space
two
objects
so
small
could
not
strike
each
other
even
with
intention
once
in
a
million
times
we
could
not
calculate
the
passing
so
closely
but
suddenly
it
seemed
that
perhaps
the
enemy
could
the
radiance
so
obviously
a
miniature
of
the
weird
streaming
from
earth
mars
and
venus
now
swung
away
from
us
and
was
extinguished
whatever
alteration
of
our
course
the
enemy
had
made
they
seemed
to
be
satisfied
the
passing
would
be
to
their
liking
would
it
be
to
ours
grantline
had
left
the
turret
he
was
down
on
the
deck
ready
with
his
men
the
weapons
were
ready
we
had
long
since
advanced
beyond
the
possibility
of
mathematical
calculations
keeping
pace
with
our
changing
position
in
relation
to
the
enemy
but
it
seemed
that
the
passing
would
be
within
fifty
miles
grantline
weapons
would
carry
their
bolt
that
far
it
was
barely
two
thousand
miles
away
now
two
minutes
of
time
before
the
passing
i
stared
at
it
a
long
low
ship
of
dark
metal
red
where
the
moonlight
struck
upon
it
i
estimated
its
size
to
be
about
that
of
the
but
it
was
much
more
nearly
globular
upon
its
top
seeming
to
project
from
the
terraced
dome
was
an
funnel
like
the
smokestack
of
an
surface
steam
vessel
or
like
a
great
black
muzzle
of
an
gun
and
in
a
row
along
the
bulging
middle
of
the
hull
there
was
a
series
of
little
discs
the
vessel
was
still
a
tiny
blob
but
every
instant
it
was
enlarging
doubling
its
visual
size
drac
said
tensely
fifteen
hundred
miles
we
pass
in
a
minute
and
a
half
i
turned
the
angle
of
the
stern
the
firmament
slowly
began
swinging
the
enemy
ship
seemed
swaying
up
over
us
i
was
turning
our
top
to
it
so
that
grantline
might
fire
directly
upward
from
both
sides
almost
simultaneously
it
might
be
possible
if
i
could
roll
us
over
at
just
the
proper
seconds
but
the
enemy
anticipated
us
as
they
observed
our
roll
again
the
flashed
on
it
visibly
struck
us
bathed
all
our
length
in
its
spreading
opalescent
radiance
it
seemed
for
an
instant
to
do
nothing
our
dome
did
not
crack
there
was
no
shock
but
our
slowed
the
heavens
stopped
their
swing
and
then
swung
back
we
were
upon
an
even
keel
again
the
enemy
level
with
our
bow
against
the
force
of
my
turning
this
radiation
had
righted
us
it
clung
a
few
seconds
more
and
again
vanished
grantline
deck
audiphone
rang
with
his
startled
voice
gregg
roll
us
over
quick
i
can
only
fire
from
one
side
i
ca
it
was
too
late
now
a
few
hundred
miles
of
distance
drac
stood
clutching
me
staring
through
the
port
and
i
stared
breathless
awaiting
the
results
of
these
next
few
seconds
the
ships
passed
like
crossing
speeding
meteors
a
few
seconds
of
final
approach
i
saw
the
enemy
vessel
as
an
elongated
flattened
globe
with
a
dome
and
terraced
decks
beneath
it
that
queer
stack
on
top
the
round
discs
like
eyes
gleamed
along
the
equator
of
the
bulging
hull
one
of
grantline
weapons
fired
a
silent
flash
still
out
of
range
the
spit
of
our
electrons
leaped
from
our
side
the
enemy
was
untouched
the
thought
stabbed
at
me
not
killed
by
that
another
shot
from
grantline
no
result
it
seemed
that
i
saw
the
bolt
strike
there
was
a
reddening
a
flash
upon
that
bulging
hull
but
nothing
more
i
was
aware
again
of
the
enemy
swinging
upon
us
the
beam
was
pressing
us
over
again
so
that
in
a
moment
we
would
be
to
the
enemy
and
grantline
could
not
fire
he
anticipated
it
the
ship
was
broadside
to
us
in
the
split
second
of
that
passing
i
saw
that
it
was
not
fifty
miles
away
hardly
ten
grantline
flung
his
remaining
bolts
the
enemy
was
a
streaked
blur
going
by
and
all
in
that
second
it
was
past
reddening
in
the
distance
untouched
by
our
bolts
it
seemed
so
the
bow
radiance
darted
ahead
of
it
the
globular
shape
unharmed
dwindled
in
the
distance
behind
us
and
it
had
done
nothing
to
us
the
control
levers
were
in
my
hands
i
would
shift
the
and
make
the
quickest
turn
we
could
we
would
go
around
the
moon
probably
and
come
back
within
an
hour
or
two
perhaps
our
adversary
would
also
turn
to
encounter
us
again
at
that
second
i
had
not
seen
the
little
discs
but
i
saw
them
now
they
came
sailing
in
a
line
ten
foot
flat
circular
discs
of
a
dark
metal
they
gleamed
reddish
where
the
sunlight
painted
them
they
had
been
fastened
outside
the
enemy
vessel
and
in
our
passing
they
had
been
discharged
they
sailed
now
like
whirling
plates
there
seemed
perhaps
twenty
of
them
heading
in
a
curve
toward
us
grantline
voice
came
again
from
the
deck
audiphone
missed
them
gregg
that
what
i
thought
but
at
least
two
of
our
bolts
must
have
struck
but
it
did
hurt
them
no
i
replied
it
seemed
not
they
must
have
a
defensive
barrage
drac
was
pulling
at
me
those
things
out
there
those
discs
grantline
demanded
yes
what
in
hell
are
they
we
could
not
tell
it
seemed
that
their
curve
would
take
them
behind
our
stern
grantline
added
will
you
try
going
back
after
that
ship
yes
but
i
did
not
to
the
naked
eye
the
enemy
ship
had
already
disappeared
but
with
the
we
saw
that
it
seemed
to
be
turning
i
did
not
attempt
to
turn
us
for
we
were
afraid
of
those
oncoming
discs
which
took
all
our
attention
they
passed
within
five
miles
astern
of
us
but
in
a
great
curve
they
swung
and
now
seemed
heading
across
our
bow
with
what
tremendous
velocity
they
had
been
endowed
by
their
firing
mechanisms
their
elliptical
curve
swung
them
a
mile
or
so
ahead
of
us
they
were
circling
us
like
tiny
satellites
in
a
narrowing
spiral
ellipse
our
attraction
the
normal
gravity
of
our
close
bulk
was
drawing
them
to
us
the
men
on
the
deck
stood
gazing
surprised
but
not
yet
alarmed
the
lookout
calls
sounded
with
routine
notification
each
time
the
discs
passed
across
our
bow
and
stern
in
the
helio
cubby
waters
was
still
trying
to
raise
an
earth
station
grantline
came
running
to
the
control
turret
if
those
cursed
things
should
strike
us
gregg
i
had
set
the
into
new
combinations
turning
our
course
downward
trying
to
swing
us
under
the
plane
of
the
discs
orbit
but
they
swung
downward
with
us
they
were
no
more
than
two
thousand
feet
away
now
grantline
said
at
the
next
broadside
passing
i
fire
at
them
drac
looked
up
from
his
calculating
instruments
look
a
circular
rotation
horribly
swift
but
i
caught
a
picture
look
he
had
a
still
image
of
one
of
the
discs
it
had
at
its
thin
outer
circumference
whirling
at
tremendous
speed
these
metal
discs
might
cut
into
our
dome
or
some
other
part
of
our
ship
at
the
next
round
grantline
fired
the
discs
reddened
a
little
but
came
on
unharmed
from
the
other
side
he
fired
again
three
of
the
discs
seemed
to
have
been
caught
full
his
bolts
sustained
for
their
fullest
ten
seconds
of
duration
at
this
close
range
took
effect
the
three
discs
seemed
to
crumble
with
a
puff
of
vacuum
then
were
gone
but
the
others
came
closing
in
the
rang
now
with
the
excitement
and
alarm
of
the
men
grantline
could
not
set
his
gauges
fast
enough
to
fire
at
every
round
i
had
a
sudden
thought
with
the
rear
rockets
i
rolled
us
over
for
a
moment
we
were
to
the
passing
discs
from
our
hull
i
flung
a
full
repulsion
would
it
stave
them
off
bend
their
orbit
outward
it
did
not
their
course
was
unaltered
again
grantline
was
shouting
at
me
roll
us
back
i
must
fire
it
had
been
an
error
that
rolling
grantline
lost
several
shots
because
of
it
i
swung
us
level
the
discs
passed
within
a
hundred
feet
half
a
dozen
of
them
were
still
closer
gleaming
whirling
circles
thin
as
they
passed
close
under
our
stern
came
broadside
these
were
tense
horrible
seconds
the
discs
skimmed
our
bow
one
seemed
to
miss
our
dome
by
inches
grantline
volley
annihilated
four
more
but
there
were
still
eight
of
them
they
swung
in
at
our
stern
i
was
aware
of
confusion
throughout
the
the
crew
and
stewards
were
running
up
to
the
bow
my
second
officer
stood
there
stricken
the
stern
lookout
screamed
his
futile
warning
useless
i
saw
one
of
the
discs
strike
our
stern
dome
then
another
still
others
they
were
silent
blows
but
it
seemed
that
i
could
feel
them
cutting
into
the
the
dome
was
cracking
then
after
that
horrible
instant
came
the
sound
crunch
a
rumble
the
grind
of
crushed
and
breaking
metal
then
the
puff
and
surge
of
the
outward
explosion
i
saw
the
whole
tip
of
the
stern
dome
cracking
bursting
outward
forced
by
our
interior
air
pressure
and
over
all
the
the
outgoing
air
was
sucking
and
whining
with
a
growing
rush
of
wind
i
shouted
drac
close
the
stern
bulkhead
i
set
the
for
the
distress
siren
and
pulled
the
lever
its
voice
screamed
over
the
uproar
forward
take
the
prepare
to
abandon
ship
in
the
midst
of
the
chaos
i
was
aware
that
all
the
remaining
discs
struck
us
upon
the
port
stern
quarter
the
broken
dome
of
the
stern
showed
a
jagged
hole
but
the
partially
shut
it
off
two
or
three
of
the
crew
and
the
stern
lookout
were
gone
behind
that
closing
bulkhead
their
bodies
in
a
moment
would
be
blown
into
space
it
may
hold
drac
order
waters
out
of
his
cubby
forward
i
was
calling
the
order
your
men
up
by
the
bow
not
the
stern
but
i
got
no
answer
from
the
i
raised
grantline
order
your
men
forward
clear
amidships
i
want
to
close
the
central
bulkheads
if
the
stern
one
breaks
with
the
pressure
right
gregg
are
we
lost
god
knows
we
know
in
a
minute
or
two
get
all
your
men
into
their
keep
in
the
bow
prepare
the
there
right
gregg
you
coming
down
yes
when
i
finish
i
cut
him
off
drac
get
out
of
here
did
you
order
waters
forward
he
wo
leave
why
the
hell
not
he
thinks
he
may
be
able
to
get
communication
with
earth
he
ca
stay
where
he
is
there
no
protection
up
here
when
that
stern
bulkhead
goes
it
was
breaking
i
could
see
it
bending
sternward
under
the
pressure
and
at
best
it
was
leaking
air
so
that
the
decks
were
a
rush
of
wind
already
drac
and
i
were
gasping
with
the
lowered
pressure
drac
get
out
of
here
go
get
waters
bring
him
forward
the
hell
with
his
transmitter
this
is
life
or
death
but
you
i
coming
down
from
the
forward
deck
call
the
hull
control
rooms
order
everybody
forward
and
to
the
deck
what
about
the
pressure
pumps
i
can
keep
them
going
from
here
i
set
the
circulating
system
to
guide
the
fresh
air
forward
but
it
was
futile
against
the
sucking
rush
of
wind
toward
the
stern
as
the
pumps
speeded
up
i
saw
with
the
little
added
pressure
the
great
cross
panel
of
the
stern
bulkhead
straining
harder
it
would
go
in
a
moment
drac
was
clinging
to
me
tell
me
what
to
do
i
told
you
what
to
do
i
shoved
him
to
the
catwalk
get
out
of
here
get
waters
forward
get
the
men
out
of
the
hull
his
anguished
eyes
stared
at
me
then
he
turned
and
ran
forward
on
the
catwalk
i
saw
him
forcibly
dragging
the
waters
from
the
helio
cubby
it
was
the
last
time
i
ever
saw
either
of
them
a
buzzer
was
ringing
in
the
turret
and
i
plunged
back
for
it
the
exertion
put
a
band
of
pain
across
my
chest
a
panting
constriction
from
the
lowering
pressure
fanning
assistant
engineer
was
still
at
the
pressure
pumps
his
voice
came
up
pumps
and
renewers
working
will
you
use
the
gravity
shifters
hell
no
get
out
of
there
fanning
we
smashed
air
going
it
a
matter
of
minutes
abandoning
ship
get
forward
suddenly
the
stern
bulkhead
cracked
with
a
great
diagonal
rift
i
waited
a
moment
to
give
them
all
time
to
get
forward
then
i
slid
all
the
cross
bulkheads
it
was
barely
in
time
the
stern
bulkhead
went
out
with
a
gale
of
wind
but
the
barrier
amidships
stemmed
it
half
of
the
vessel
sternward
was
devoid
of
air
but
here
in
the
bow
we
could
last
a
little
longer
beneath
me
i
could
see
grantline
men
some
of
them
not
all
and
a
few
of
the
stewards
crew
and
officers
crowding
the
deck
donning
the
two
side
chambers
were
ready
half
a
dozen
men
crowded
into
each
of
them
the
deck
doors
slid
closed
the
outer
ports
opened
helmeted
goggled
bloated
figures
were
blown
by
the
outgoing
air
from
the
chamber
into
space
then
the
outer
slides
went
closed
the
pumps
filled
up
the
chambers
the
deck
doors
opened
again
another
batch
of
men
i
saw
grantline
suited
but
with
his
helmet
off
dashing
from
one
side
of
the
deck
to
the
other
commanding
the
abandonment
the
central
bulkheads
seemed
momentarily
holding
then
little
red
lights
in
the
panel
board
before
me
showed
where
in
the
hull
corridors
the
doors
were
leaking
cracking
giving
away
breaking
under
the
strain
the
whole
ribbed
framework
of
the
vessel
was
strained
and
slued
the
bulkhead
sides
no
longer
set
true
in
the
casements
air
was
whining
everywhere
and
pulling
sternward
it
was
the
last
stand
i
was
aware
that
the
alarm
siren
had
ceased
there
was
a
sudden
stillness
with
only
the
shouts
of
the
remaining
men
at
the
mingling
with
the
whine
of
the
wind
and
the
roaring
in
my
head
i
felt
detached
my
senses
were
reeling
i
staggered
to
the
gauges
of
the
erentz
system
the
system
whereby
an
oscillating
current
circling
within
the
walls
of
hull
and
dome
absorbed
into
negative
energy
much
of
the
interior
pressure
the
main
walls
of
the
vessel
were
straining
outward
the
could
collapse
at
any
moment
i
started
for
the
catwalk
door
the
stood
near
it
and
i
yielded
to
a
vague
desire
to
gaze
into
the
eyepiece
the
instrument
was
still
operative
i
swept
it
sternward
the
enemy
ship
had
not
vanished
by
what
strange
means
i
can
not
say
its
velocity
had
been
checked
a
few
thousand
miles
from
us
it
was
making
a
narrow
turn
coming
back
i
thought
so
i
suddenly
realized
my
intention
of
having
all
the
in
neutral
before
abandoning
the
ship
i
seized
the
controls
now
an
agony
of
fear
was
upon
me
that
the
shifting
valves
would
fail
but
they
did
not
the
plates
slid
haltingly
reluctantly
i
recall
staggering
to
the
catwalk
it
seemed
that
the
central
bulkhead
was
breaking
there
were
fallen
figures
on
the
deck
beneath
me
i
stumbled
against
the
body
of
a
man
who
had
tangled
himself
in
the
stays
of
the
ladder
rail
and
was
hanging
there
i
think
i
fell
the
last
ten
feet
to
the
deck
the
roaring
in
my
ears
the
bands
tightening
about
my
chest
encompassed
all
the
world
then
i
was
on
my
feet
again
and
i
stumbled
over
another
body
it
was
garbed
in
a
with
the
helmet
beside
it
i
stripped
it
of
the
suit
i
was
panting
with
all
the
world
whirling
in
a
daze
bursting
spots
of
light
before
my
eyes
ten
feet
away
down
the
deck
was
the
opened
door
of
the
pressure
chamber
a
bloated
figure
came
into
my
dreamlike
vista
moving
for
the
pressure
door
it
turned
saw
me
came
leaping
and
bent
over
me
i
saw
behind
the
vizor
that
it
was
grantline
his
bloated
gloved
hands
helped
me
don
my
suit
he
helped
me
with
my
helmet
the
metal
tip
on
grantline
gloved
hand
touched
the
on
my
shoulder
his
voice
sounded
from
the
tiny
audiphone
grid
within
my
helmet
gregg
thank
god
i
found
you
all
right
yes
my
head
was
clearing
i
got
the
chamber
ready
we
the
last
gregg
i
gripped
his
shoulder
you
sure
there
nobody
else
no
i
been
everywhere
i
could
reach
the
central
bulkheads
are
almost
gone
he
pushed
me
into
the
pressure
chamber
there
was
hardly
need
to
close
the
door
after
us
i
stood
gripping
him
as
he
opened
the
small
outer
slides
the
abyss
was
at
our
feet
the
outgoing
wind
tore
at
us
like
a
gale
so
that
we
stood
gripping
the
casements
thank
god
you
got
a
gregg
so
have
i
we
must
keep
together
yes
i
could
feel
the
floor
grid
of
the
chamber
shuddering
beneath
my
feet
the
was
cracking
bursting
outward
throughout
her
length
at
any
instant
she
might
collapse
for
a
moment
we
stood
poised
beneath
us
here
at
the
brink
were
millions
upon
millions
of
miles
of
emptiness
the
remote
unfathomable
void
blazing
worlds
down
there
in
the
black
darkness
gregg
it
may
be
the
end
for
us
good
luck
johnny
his
bloated
figure
dropped
away
from
me
i
waited
just
an
instant
and
then
i
dove
into
space
for
a
moment
there
was
a
chaos
of
strangeness
the
wrench
to
my
sense
of
the
transition
i
had
been
the
inhabitant
of
a
little
world
the
with
a
gravity
beneath
my
feet
now
in
a
breath
i
had
no
world
to
inhabit
i
was
alone
in
space
no
gravity
nothing
solid
to
touch
emptiness
i
was
in
a
world
to
myself
and
the
abnormality
of
it
brought
a
mental
shock
but
in
a
moment
the
adjustment
came
i
passed
the
transition
the
sense
of
falling
the
firmament
steadied
and
my
senses
cleared
my
dive
from
the
carried
me
in
a
slow
arc
some
three
hundred
feet
away
there
had
been
a
sense
of
falling
but
no
actual
fall
my
velocity
was
retarded
with
the
mass
of
the
pulling
at
me
i
went
like
a
toy
boat
in
water
shoved
by
a
child
quickly
slowing
in
a
few
moments
the
velocity
was
gone
and
i
hung
poised
i
saw
bloated
form
not
over
fifty
feet
from
me
he
waved
an
arm
at
me
out
here
in
the
void
i
lay
weightless
as
though
upon
an
infinitely
soft
feather
bed
i
could
kick
flounder
but
not
endow
myself
with
motion
i
craned
my
neck
gazed
around
through
the
bulging
vizor
pane
the
earth
and
the
sun
hung
level
with
the
white
strewn
everywhere
i
could
not
see
that
unknown
from
greater
new
york
it
was
shafting
out
now
in
the
other
direction
so
that
the
earth
hid
it
from
me
venus
was
visible
to
one
side
of
the
sun
the
enemy
from
grebhar
was
apparent
and
as
i
turned
my
body
and
bent
double
to
look
behind
me
i
saw
mars
and
the
ray
from
the
beams
streamed
off
like
the
radiance
of
the
milky
way
faintly
luminous
but
seemingly
visible
for
an
infinite
distance
the
was
obviously
falling
now
toward
the
moon
drawn
irresistibly
and
all
of
us
with
her
toward
the
lunar
surface
it
seemed
so
close
that
black
and
white
mountainous
disc
we
were
i
suppose
some
twenty
thousand
miles
from
it
gathering
speed
as
it
pulled
at
us
but
that
motion
was
not
apparent
now
distance
dwindled
all
these
celestial
motions
so
that
all
the
firmament
seemed
frozen
into
immobility
but
there
was
some
motion
twenty
or
more
bloated
figures
the
survivors
from
the
wreck
of
the
were
encircling
it
in
varying
orbits
revolving
around
it
like
tiny
satellites
some
were
closing
in
drawn
against
it
i
saw
one
plunge
against
the
wrecked
dome
and
begin
crawling
like
a
fly
and
i
found
that
the
forces
of
the
firmament
were
molding
my
orbit
also
my
outward
plunge
was
checked
i
poised
for
an
indeterminate
instant
and
then
i
took
my
orbit
i
too
was
a
satellite
of
the
i
gazed
at
the
wreck
of
the
my
ship
my
first
command
so
smoothly
confidently
rising
from
the
earth
only
a
few
hours
ago
and
she
had
come
to
this
she
lay
askew
in
the
heavens
the
dome
was
cracked
throughout
all
its
length
and
smashed
like
a
shell
at
the
sterntip
i
could
see
the
interior
litter
beneath
the
dome
the
twisted
and
strained
lines
of
the
hull
a
dead
ship
now
the
mechanisms
stilled
dead
and
silent
inside
with
all
the
warmth
gone
out
of
it
all
the
air
dissipated
so
that
in
every
cubby
every
dark
corridor
of
that
broken
hull
there
was
the
coldness
and
silence
of
interplanetary
space
i
suppose
these
thoughts
swept
me
within
a
few
seconds
i
saw
myself
starting
to
revolve
in
my
orbit
perhaps
my
motion
would
carry
me
around
indefinitely
or
i
might
be
drawn
down
to
the
vessel
as
those
other
survivors
had
been
drawn
grantline
with
one
of
the
few
power
suits
was
coming
toward
me
now
with
tiny
fluorescent
streams
back
along
his
body
from
his
shoulder
blades
i
switched
on
my
own
mechanism
it
moved
me
toward
him
and
our
gravity
attracted
us
we
shut
off
the
power
when
twenty
feet
apart
drifted
together
contacted
bounced
apart
like
rubber
balls
as
our
inflated
suits
struck
then
in
a
moment
we
had
drifted
back
and
clung
i
touched
the
metal
plate
of
his
shoulder
working
all
right
yes
thank
god
for
this
much
gregg
i
wonder
how
many
are
alive
in
the
chaos
of
the
abandonment
many
of
the
men
air
mechanisms
had
failed
to
operate
it
is
always
so
in
times
of
disaster
we
could
see
revolving
around
the
wreck
and
motionless
against
its
dome
those
horrible
flabby
deflated
suits
where
the
delicate
erentz
mechanism
had
failed
within
was
only
a
corpse
too
many
i
said
and
not
more
than
four
or
five
of
us
with
power
what
shall
we
do
first
round
them
up
we
must
all
get
together
his
answering
voice
was
grim
we
can
tow
them
from
the
wreck
six
or
seven
of
us
altogether
have
power
do
you
suppose
we
can
get
away
gregg
get
loose
from
the
ship
before
she
falls
only
trying
it
could
tell
us
that
the
and
all
of
us
with
her
were
plunging
for
the
moon
we
would
seek
out
the
men
who
were
alive
and
tow
them
in
a
string
if
we
could
break
the
gravity
pull
of
the
ship
and
then
struggle
upward
from
the
moon
we
could
maintain
ourselves
here
in
space
until
some
rescue
ship
from
earth
venus
or
mars
would
come
and
pick
us
up
you
take
one
side
gregg
i
take
the
other
do
go
aboard
she
might
collapse
i
pick
up
the
men
without
power
and
alive
the
others
with
power
suits
will
do
the
same
then
we
meet
out
here
about
where
we
are
now
yes
and
hurry
gregg
every
mile
toward
the
moon
makes
it
that
much
harder
we
falling
fast
good
luck
i
shoved
away
from
him
and
within
a
minute
as
he
went
in
an
arc
toward
the
bow
and
i
toward
her
stern
i
suddenly
thought
of
that
returning
enemy
vessel
my
last
look
through
the
had
shown
that
she
was
returning
and
then
i
had
forgotten
it
my
gaze
swept
the
firmament
now
i
had
no
instruments
within
the
helmet
with
the
naked
eye
the
enemy
ship
was
not
in
sight
but
i
knew
that
meant
little
within
a
moment
she
could
come
in
view
and
be
here
if
she
were
going
at
any
great
velocity
there
were
on
the
at
the
time
of
the
disaster
some
men
perhaps
forty
had
gotten
away
and
i
could
see
very
soon
that
not
more
than
fifteen
or
less
out
here
were
alive
two
with
power
were
ahead
of
me
now
slowly
floating
past
the
wrecked
dome
of
the
stern
one
had
picked
up
two
others
found
them
alive
and
was
towing
them
out
they
went
past
me
moving
very
slowly
so
that
i
could
see
that
two
were
all
that
one
of
us
could
tow
and
attain
any
velocity
at
all
i
contacted
with
the
leader
he
was
one
of
grantline
men
two
or
three
hundred
feet
out
i
directed
i
gestured
grantline
said
to
meet
out
there
i
tow
others
yes
around
the
stern
you
find
god
haljan
look
a
mile
from
us
the
enemy
ship
was
in
view
passing
no
stopping
with
incredible
retardation
she
had
plunged
into
view
was
here
and
yet
had
no
great
forward
velocity
she
seemed
no
more
rapid
than
a
great
air
liner
winging
past
so
close
that
her
bulging
hull
length
showed
clearly
the
discs
were
gone
the
funnel
set
on
top
of
her
was
sloped
diagonally
toward
us
as
she
rolled
on
her
side
so
that
momentarily
i
could
see
down
into
it
there
was
some
mechanism
down
there
the
bow
radiance
was
a
narrow
opalescent
beam
in
advance
of
the
bow
slowing
haljan
yes
stopping
do
try
to
meet
grantline
tow
your
men
away
or
should
we
board
the
and
hide
no
they
come
back
to
bombard
her
i
kicked
at
him
violently
with
his
two
drifting
figures
clinging
behind
he
swung
past
me
i
headed
behind
the
stern
upon
its
dangling
framework
several
of
our
men
were
glued
lying
there
inert
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
interior
of
the
stern
the
littered
deck
men
lying
there
had
been
stricken
before
they
had
time
to
get
into
their
suits
on
the
outside
forward
i
saw
grantline
come
rounding
the
bow
towing
a
figure
and
heading
for
another
on
the
outside
of
the
a
group
of
others
were
perched
gesticulating
for
help
i
started
that
way
then
i
saw
another
and
nearer
figure
in
a
power
suit
heading
for
them
i
swung
back
there
were
two
figures
on
the
outside
of
the
whom
i
could
more
quickly
reach
inverted
flies
their
feet
were
on
the
keel
they
stooped
and
waved
toward
me
i
took
a
swoop
passing
close
down
the
hull
my
struck
the
hull
plates
and
gave
me
sudden
downward
velocity
i
shot
down
out
past
the
keel
and
again
i
saw
the
enemy
ship
she
hung
poised
no
more
than
two
miles
away
and
as
i
looped
over
with
all
the
black
firmament
in
a
dizzy
whirl
the
great
first
above
and
then
below
me
i
saw
the
of
the
enemy
swinging
it
came
to
the
and
there
it
clung
i
had
gone
perhaps
fifty
feet
below
the
keel
with
my
dive
when
i
righted
i
was
mounting
i
saw
the
opalescent
circle
of
the
beam
moving
along
the
hull
it
seemed
to
do
no
damage
then
suddenly
it
darted
down
and
clung
to
me
i
felt
nothing
save
the
impact
of
a
gentle
push
something
shoving
with
a
ponderable
force
against
me
i
saw
the
receding
the
heavens
swinging
as
i
turned
over
the
red
disc
of
the
distant
earth
swooped
the
moon
surface
momentarily
seemed
rotating
and
lifting
above
me
i
was
helpless
rolling
then
whirling
then
again
i
steadied
the
beam
was
gone
from
me
i
saw
the
a
full
mile
away
from
me
the
enemy
ship
was
again
in
motion
moving
toward
me
and
between
the
and
the
earth
and
the
beam
was
steady
upon
the
the
had
a
new
velocity
now
i
could
not
miss
it
she
was
dwindling
rapidly
in
visual
size
relative
to
me
she
was
receding
falling
upon
the
moon
more
than
that
she
was
being
pushed
downward
by
the
repulsive
force
of
the
strange
enemy
beam
upon
her
i
stared
as
with
all
the
little
dots
which
were
our
men
around
and
upon
her
she
went
down
into
the
void
i
found
myself
presently
alone
up
here
with
the
enemy
ship
hovering
nearby
its
maneuvering
to
thrust
the
wrecked
toward
the
moon
had
brought
it
within
a
mile
of
me
the
was
still
on
the
and
then
abruptly
it
vanished
the
had
almost
dwindled
beyond
the
sight
of
my
unaided
vision
by
chance
undoubtedly
the
beam
had
fallen
upon
me
and
thrust
me
from
the
wreck
i
was
alone
up
here
now
with
the
enemy
but
they
may
not
have
noticed
me
or
cared
i
found
my
power
mechanism
intact
i
turned
it
on
slowly
like
a
log
in
water
i
began
moving
away
a
minute
five
minutes
the
was
lost
grantline
all
the
men
were
lost
with
that
added
downward
thrust
they
could
never
free
themselves
from
the
falling
wreck
i
was
jerked
out
of
my
thoughts
by
the
sight
of
an
oncoming
red
blob
something
was
coming
from
the
enemy
ship
red
with
the
sunlight
and
earthlight
silvered
by
the
moon
and
the
stars
it
took
form
it
was
a
disc
another
of
those
cursed
whirling
discs
sent
to
annihilate
me
then
when
it
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
i
saw
that
it
was
a
disc
which
was
turning
slowly
rocket
radiances
came
from
its
rotating
circumference
it
came
sailing
directly
at
me
so
swiftly
that
my
own
velocity
was
futile
another
minute
and
i
was
caught
i
saw
that
the
disc
was
some
fifteen
feet
in
diameter
and
that
it
bulged
so
that
within
its
convex
floor
and
ceiling
was
a
space
of
several
feet
i
cut
off
my
power
and
with
pounding
heart
lay
waiting
the
had
no
weapons
for
equipment
save
a
knife
hung
in
the
belt
i
drew
it
out
held
it
in
my
gloved
fingers
the
disc
sailed
upon
its
level
vertical
axis
its
rotation
slowed
i
saw
little
windows
set
around
its
convex
middle
it
came
up
and
bumped
me
with
its
metal
side
i
kicked
away
shoved
off
shapes
were
moving
in
a
dim
interior
light
behind
the
little
of
radiance
darted
out
they
seemed
to
seize
me
draw
me
i
found
myself
glued
helplessly
to
the
convex
outer
surface
of
the
disc
the
rotation
gathered
speed
again
but
i
looked
presently
only
at
the
gleaming
surface
to
which
i
was
pinned
had
i
been
a
metal
bar
upon
the
horns
of
an
i
could
not
have
been
more
helpless
an
interval
passed
with
the
contact
plate
of
my
fingers
against
this
hull
it
seemed
that
i
could
hear
voices
within
strange
indistinguishable
words
i
twisted
but
could
not
see
into
the
port
again
the
rotation
was
slowing
the
near
shape
of
the
enemy
vessel
swung
close
and
past
and
again
and
again
i
saw
that
we
were
over
it
dropping
down
into
the
wide
black
opening
of
the
it
yawned
presently
like
a
great
black
tunnel
into
which
we
fell
the
jar
of
landing
knocked
me
loose
and
no
doubt
the
attraction
radiance
also
released
me
i
fell
another
space
bounced
up
and
sank
back
i
thought
that
something
like
a
sliding
closed
over
me
and
then
in
the
dimness
figures
were
gripping
me
i
lashed
and
struck
but
the
knife
was
wrenched
away
i
was
a
prisoner
in
a
of
the
enemy
ship
it
seemed
that
the
small
room
had
a
very
faint
radiance
showing
through
my
vizor
pane
narrow
enclosing
walls
were
visible
it
was
a
space
fifteen
feet
or
so
down
one
side
with
a
concave
ceiling
overhead
i
was
lying
on
the
floor
the
darkness
at
first
had
been
impenetrable
the
figures
which
had
flung
me
down
and
seized
my
knife
were
gone
i
had
not
seen
them
nor
where
they
went
for
a
moment
i
lay
cushioned
by
my
bloated
suit
when
i
struggled
to
my
feet
i
was
almost
weightless
the
movement
of
getting
upright
flung
me
upward
as
though
i
were
a
tossed
feather
my
helmet
struck
the
metal
ceiling
so
sharp
a
blow
that
i
feared
for
an
instant
i
had
smashed
the
helmet
from
the
ceiling
with
flailing
arms
and
legs
i
sank
back
to
the
and
in
a
moment
i
was
able
to
stand
upright
with
so
slight
a
feeling
of
weight
that
i
could
have
been
a
bit
of
thistle
ready
to
blow
away
in
the
least
wind
there
was
as
i
stood
there
balancing
myself
a
queer
feeling
of
triumph
within
me
a
triumphant
hope
for
coming
down
in
the
capacious
funnel
larger
than
it
had
seemed
from
a
distance
i
had
seen
what
appeared
to
be
a
small
projectile
resting
in
some
strange
landing
gear
the
disc
bearing
me
had
settled
on
a
stage
alongside
it
was
that
the
projectile
from
earth
a
growing
air
pressure
was
around
me
the
tiny
erentz
dials
within
my
helmet
had
been
immovable
but
now
they
were
showing
outside
pressure
i
stood
waiting
whatever
sounds
were
here
i
could
not
tell
then
presently
the
dials
stopped
they
registered
seventeen
pounds
whatever
that
might
mean
here
i
loosed
the
helmet
and
took
it
off
with
the
first
gasping
breath
my
senses
reeled
i
sank
to
the
floor
and
though
i
tried
to
replace
the
helmet
it
was
too
late
my
thoughts
were
fading
a
strange
chemical
odor
was
in
my
nostrils
it
was
like
breathing
a
thin
perfumed
water
the
drifting
away
was
pleasant
tortured
dreams
came
with
my
awakening
i
found
myself
in
the
same
dim
room
upon
the
floor
i
could
breathe
better
now
and
in
a
few
more
hours
the
strangeness
had
almost
gone
i
found
now
that
i
was
not
injured
but
i
was
ravenously
hungry
again
gingerly
as
before
i
stood
up
and
slid
my
from
me
and
now
i
was
aware
of
movement
and
sound
the
vibrations
were
apparent
and
there
was
a
dim
distant
tiny
throbbing
it
was
much
like
the
interior
of
the
while
in
flight
and
there
were
other
sounds
indescribably
faint
yet
strangely
clear
i
thought
they
might
be
distant
voices
i
took
a
cautious
step
i
could
see
a
dim
blank
wall
nearby
with
what
seemed
a
article
of
furniture
on
the
floor
against
the
wall
for
all
my
caution
i
sailed
upward
but
this
time
i
held
my
balance
and
i
found
that
with
my
negligible
weight
i
could
almost
swim
in
this
strange
air
i
hit
the
wall
and
slid
slowly
down
it
to
the
floor
again
like
a
man
sinking
to
the
bottom
of
a
tank
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
to
put
my
ear
against
the
wall
at
once
the
sounds
all
became
incredibly
louder
it
was
a
confusion
of
sound
the
mechanisms
of
the
vessel
some
of
which
i
thought
i
could
identify
and
some
not
the
strange
swish
and
thump
of
what
might
have
been
people
moving
and
there
were
voices
the
voices
seemed
mingled
babble
coming
from
everywhere
the
timber
of
the
sound
was
very
strange
it
held
no
suggestion
of
how
far
away
from
me
the
voices
might
be
there
were
so
many
of
them
i
could
only
think
they
were
scattered
about
the
ship
and
yet
they
all
seemed
together
after
a
moment
the
blend
was
less
confusing
again
very
strangely
my
hearing
seemed
able
to
separate
one
from
the
other
i
was
to
learn
that
the
atmosphere
handled
sound
vibrations
differently
from
that
of
earth
voices
had
a
muffled
tone
as
though
they
were
smothered
there
was
undoubtedly
a
vibrational
distortion
and
a
speed
slower
than
earth
rate
of
feet
a
second
perhaps
as
slow
as
yet
sounds
remained
audible
over
longer
distances
than
on
earth
in
this
instance
now
as
i
listened
with
my
ear
to
the
wall
of
the
ship
i
was
hearing
all
its
sounds
picked
up
and
carried
by
the
metal
now
i
heard
a
strange
tongue
two
types
of
voices
slow
measured
phrases
and
voices
of
a
curiously
sepulchral
hollow
sound
my
mind
went
back
to
the
red
spark
restaurant
room
and
suddenly
i
realized
that
amid
the
babble
i
was
hearing
english
a
man
voice
talking
english
i
caught
very
clearly
the
phrase
master
yes
she
means
well
can
you
not
see
it
molo
voice
then
the
girls
must
be
here
also
another
voice
i
am
not
sure
perhaps
the
great
intelligence
will
talk
with
her
when
we
are
arrived
it
was
the
slow
measured
voice
of
one
of
the
brains
when
will
that
be
pretty
soon
now
wo
it
molo
venza
a
great
wave
of
thankfulness
swept
me
and
then
i
heard
anita
your
two
captives
where
are
they
you
not
going
to
kill
them
are
you
no
said
molo
perhaps
not
no
one
has
inspected
the
new
one
yet
the
other
is
being
cared
for
the
great
intelligence
will
question
him
when
we
arrive
we
are
arriving
said
venza
that
your
world
wandl
down
there
is
it
yes
we
are
dropping
fast
the
voice
of
the
brain
come
wyk
the
instruments
are
showing
events
on
our
captured
worlds
take
me
to
watch
i
am
tired
of
movement
yes
master
it
seemed
that
the
brain
was
being
carried
away
molo
and
the
two
girls
were
being
left
alone
i
had
thought
at
first
that
they
were
in
the
adjacent
room
to
me
but
they
could
have
been
far
distant
they
had
mentioned
two
captives
one
obviously
was
myself
was
the
other
snap
come
molo
was
saying
stand
here
with
me
and
we
will
watch
this
world
not
mine
venza
as
you
just
called
it
but
my
adopted
world
and
it
will
be
yours
until
we
rule
the
new
mars
i
heard
them
moving
to
gaze
through
the
then
came
voice
if
it
anything
like
this
ship
it
will
be
very
strange
strange
indeed
little
dove
i
was
there
only
once
a
month
ago
and
for
a
few
hours
only
the
great
intelligence
as
they
call
him
talked
with
me
absorbing
my
knowledge
they
call
it
that
and
he
was
much
impressed
by
me
and
made
very
wonderful
promises
in
exchange
for
my
fidelity
and
for
my
sister
too
i
learned
further
how
molo
and
meka
became
identified
with
the
wandlites
it
was
as
we
had
suspected
you
will
rule
mars
venza
was
saying
when
this
is
over
you
mean
you
will
really
be
given
mars
to
rule
i
would
rather
live
on
the
earth
said
anita
there
was
a
young
man
there
he
will
not
be
there
much
longer
molo
laughed
you
are
very
lucky
that
i
fancy
you
lucky
indeed
venza
echoed
no
death
for
me
i
too
young
but
all
those
millions
dead
it
seems
so
terrible
it
is
for
them
molo
was
in
high
good
humor
pleased
with
himself
and
with
these
girls
see
down
there
that
blurring
is
the
heavy
air
we
almost
down
into
it
now
i
heard
the
sound
of
someone
joining
them
and
then
the
hollow
voice
again
molo
bad
tidings
come
from
mars
one
of
the
masters
was
captured
there
in
they
tortured
him
as
they
did
the
one
on
earth
but
he
did
not
die
unyielding
he
spoke
and
told
our
plans
hah
did
i
not
advise
you
to
keep
those
helpless
things
on
wandl
but
it
is
done
now
the
worlds
know
our
purpose
they
are
preparing
spaceships
already
some
are
rising
from
from
grebhar
and
from
greater
new
york
we
knew
they
were
doing
that
but
now
they
know
our
purpose
the
master
intelligence
fears
that
they
will
come
raiding
wandl
our
vessels
are
being
made
ready
to
go
out
and
repel
them
the
hollow
voice
ceased
your
purpose
discovered
asked
anita
what
does
that
mean
you
tell
us
now
twin
queens
for
your
future
mars
and
you
treat
us
like
children
that
he
so
cleverly
planted
in
greater
new
york
venza
hinted
yes
i
will
tell
you
without
me
in
new
york
and
my
men
who
went
with
these
wandlites
to
and
grebhar
the
vital
gravity
beams
could
never
successfully
have
been
planted
the
apparatus
was
complicated
you
saw
it
you
saw
the
labor
i
had
making
the
contact
but
what
are
the
for
i
listened
breathless
as
he
told
them
the
electronic
beams
could
not
be
destroyed
a
disintegration
of
the
rock
atoms
had
been
set
up
with
each
rotation
of
the
earth
it
was
sweeping
the
sky
from
a
great
control
station
wandl
was
flinging
attraction
gravity
upon
that
beam
using
it
as
a
monstrous
lever
upon
the
rotation
of
earth
with
every
daily
passage
now
the
force
was
being
exerted
the
rotation
was
slowing
in
a
few
days
it
would
stop
with
the
end
of
the
beam
drawn
to
wandl
and
held
there
and
the
beams
from
grebhar
and
were
the
same
three
giant
chains
then
wandl
traveling
of
its
own
gravitational
volition
would
withdraw
from
our
solar
system
the
gravitational
chains
would
pull
the
earth
venus
and
mars
after
it
titanic
the
destruction
not
of
our
worlds
but
of
all
life
upon
them
for
the
cold
of
interstellar
space
would
leave
no
living
organism
three
dead
worlds
wandl
would
draw
them
to
her
own
sun
and
then
free
them
send
them
with
new
orbits
around
the
distant
blazing
star
three
new
worlds
brought
home
triumphantly
by
wandl
to
join
the
little
family
of
inhabited
planets
revolving
around
this
other
sun
three
fair
and
lovely
worlds
warmed
back
by
the
other
sunlight
to
be
green
mansions
untenanted
ready
to
receive
the
new
beings
who
would
come
and
possess
them
you
snap
gregg
but
how
hush
they
might
hear
us
they
can
do
more
than
that
they
can
almost
hear
you
think
anita
and
venza
are
here
i
know
it
i
was
with
them
for
a
time
this
accursed
gravity
i
walk
careful
i
whispered
you
can
crack
your
head
on
something
with
the
least
false
step
are
they
taking
us
ashore
i
guess
so
how
did
you
happen
tell
you
later
they
had
come
for
me
in
that
dark
taken
me
along
a
dim
corridor
of
the
ship
which
evidently
had
landed
a
few
moments
before
then
snap
with
strange
figures
around
him
had
been
flung
at
me
these
weird
beings
the
brains
were
here
but
not
many
i
saw
half
a
dozen
on
the
ship
they
could
move
easily
now
they
bounced
upon
their
small
arms
and
legs
hitching
with
little
leaps
of
a
few
feet
close
at
hand
they
were
gruesome
from
a
distance
they
had
the
aspect
of
ovoids
bouncing
of
their
own
volition
and
i
saw
too
that
underneath
toward
the
back
was
a
shriveled
body
the
other
figures
were
wholly
different
they
seemed
at
first
to
be
upright
insects
the
two
legs
were
like
stilts
the
body
narrow
but
with
bulging
chest
the
neck
was
thin
holding
the
small
round
head
about
the
size
of
my
own
words
seem
futile
to
picture
this
thing
which
was
a
man
of
wandl
there
was
no
skin
but
instead
what
seemed
to
be
a
glossy
hard
brown
shell
it
was
laid
in
scales
and
upon
the
legs
was
a
brown
fuzz
of
stiff
hair
there
were
many
joints
both
of
the
legs
and
the
torso
clothing
was
worn
a
single
garment
hanging
from
a
wide
belt
halfway
down
the
legs
seemed
incongruous
fantastically
aping
humanity
this
was
the
worker
equipped
by
nature
for
mechanical
tasks
there
were
not
two
arms
but
at
least
ten
from
what
could
have
been
called
the
shoulders
they
were
tentacles
half
the
length
of
an
trunk
with
hands
at
the
ends
from
the
waist
depended
huge
pincers
and
from
the
chest
and
back
the
arms
were
smaller
each
with
a
different
type
the
head
and
face
were
most
of
all
a
personal
mocking
of
mankind
wide
upstanding
listening
ears
were
upon
the
sides
of
the
head
one
on
the
forehead
and
one
on
the
back
the
face
was
mobile
with
tiny
brown
scales
small
as
a
fish
a
nose
orifice
with
two
protruding
brown
eyes
above
it
was
set
outward
on
stems
and
an
upended
slit
of
a
mouth
there
was
an
eye
in
the
back
of
the
head
probably
over
eons
of
upward
development
from
what
was
perhaps
an
original
single
type
these
two
specialized
forms
had
developed
the
masters
as
they
were
known
upon
wandl
neglected
the
body
for
the
brain
and
the
workers
the
reverse
there
was
no
separate
individual
for
the
female
as
is
the
case
with
primitive
organisms
they
were
all
the
parent
dying
in
the
reproduction
of
offspring
of
necessity
i
have
been
forced
into
digression
but
at
the
time
snap
and
i
clung
together
whispering
as
a
group
of
workers
pushed
us
down
a
descending
incline
snap
back
there
in
greater
new
york
when
contact
light
had
burst
into
existence
had
fallen
half
unconscious
they
picked
him
up
molo
was
going
to
kill
him
but
the
girls
persuaded
him
to
take
snap
with
them
anita
and
venza
pretended
never
to
have
seen
me
before
snap
whispered
to
me
now
you
take
the
same
line
if
we
get
with
them
we
will
it
was
weird
this
landing
upon
wandl
we
had
left
the
and
were
descending
what
seemed
a
narrow
landing
incline
we
were
outdoors
and
it
was
night
shafts
of
colored
radiance
flashed
around
us
the
ship
was
poised
on
a
platform
with
skeleton
legs
it
seemed
a
hundred
feet
or
more
down
to
the
ground
level
from
where
the
colored
lights
were
darting
up
overhead
was
a
cloudless
sky
of
blurred
reddish
stars
no
doubt
the
curious
atmosphere
of
wandl
gave
the
sky
and
stars
this
abnormal
look
later
what
a
multiplicity
of
obscure
wonders
we
were
to
glimpse
upon
wandl
the
slowing
rotation
of
the
earth
caused
climatic
changes
there
volcanic
and
tidal
disturbances
but
wandl
rotated
and
stopped
at
will
undoubtedly
she
was
equipped
to
withstand
the
shock
her
internal
fires
could
not
break
into
eruption
she
had
very
little
fluid
surface
and
the
nature
of
her
atmosphere
was
such
that
it
was
not
easily
disturbed
into
storms
only
if
there
was
laxity
in
the
handling
of
the
planet
motion
would
a
storm
come
but
now
questions
pounded
at
me
earth
venus
and
mars
were
to
be
towed
into
interstellar
space
all
life
on
our
worlds
would
perish
in
the
cold
of
that
stellar
journey
yet
wandl
had
made
that
journey
was
her
atmosphere
inherently
such
that
it
did
not
transmit
rays
of
heat
snap
and
i
had
been
pushed
down
the
incline
with
half
a
dozen
figures
in
advance
of
us
without
difficulty
we
could
have
leapt
down
that
hundred
feet
unaided
figures
were
leaping
into
from
several
of
the
ship
they
did
not
fall
but
floated
drifted
down
i
saw
one
of
the
workers
drop
with
motionless
outstretched
arms
others
came
mounting
up
using
their
arms
and
legs
with
sweeping
strokes
as
though
swimming
it
was
like
being
under
water
it
was
a
strange
weird
scene
the
vessel
wavering
above
us
the
flashing
lights
waving
beams
of
radiance
a
fantastic
structure
nearby
reared
itself
several
hundred
feet
with
lights
on
top
and
outlining
its
many
lateral
balconies
one
above
the
other
the
air
was
full
of
the
leaping
swimming
figures
the
brains
the
masters
were
not
in
evidence
then
i
saw
one
of
them
being
carried
and
others
floating
down
like
distended
falling
balloons
to
be
caught
by
the
workers
in
small
nets
and
thus
saved
from
jarring
contact
snap
was
suddenly
whispering
that
fellow
back
of
us
is
our
guard
i
can
feel
his
ray
some
form
of
attraction
it
pulling
at
me
snap
was
a
little
behind
me
i
turned
and
saw
the
faint
radiance
of
a
narrow
upon
him
it
came
from
an
instrument
in
an
upper
shoulder
hand
of
the
insect
figure
following
us
no
doubt
the
reverse
form
of
the
same
ray
which
had
been
used
to
thrust
the
wrecked
toward
the
moon
we
reached
the
bottom
i
saw
now
that
the
group
of
workers
in
advance
of
us
were
carrying
metal
cubes
seemingly
of
considerable
weight
they
also
had
to
use
the
incline
we
stood
presently
on
a
smooth
ground
surface
we
had
not
seen
anita
and
venza
nor
molo
and
his
sister
the
insect
figure
who
was
our
guard
came
forward
you
stand
here
molo
comes
where
is
he
i
demanded
i
want
to
see
him
i
stopped
myself
quickly
i
had
very
nearly
mentioned
the
girls
and
talk
with
him
he
comes
soon
i
hungry
i
gestured
to
my
stomach
food
you
know
what
that
is
the
brown
scaly
face
contorted
for
a
smile
a
ghastly
grimace
yes
you
shall
have
food
and
drink
it
seemed
that
the
hollow
voice
came
not
from
the
neck
but
from
the
bulging
chest
he
stood
aside
with
the
globular
weapon
of
the
ray
in
a
pincer
hand
we
waited
standing
gingerly
together
wavering
with
our
slight
weight
a
wind
would
have
blown
us
away
but
there
was
no
wind
instead
there
was
a
heavy
sultry
air
warm
as
a
earth
night
warmer
even
than
the
of
venus
snap
and
i
were
dressed
much
the
same
wearing
heavy
boots
for
which
weight
we
were
thankful
tight
trousers
flaring
at
the
top
and
white
blouses
both
of
us
were
doubtless
we
were
as
fantastic
a
sight
to
these
wandlites
as
they
to
us
some
of
the
workers
crowded
up
reaching
out
to
pluck
at
us
but
snap
waved
them
away
and
our
guard
dispersed
them
one
of
the
master
brains
came
bouncing
up
upon
his
little
upright
body
the
great
head
wavered
you
will
wait
here
his
eyes
glowed
up
at
us
but
listen
snap
began
you
will
wait
here
for
the
martian
he
has
his
orders
to
take
you
to
the
great
intelligence
the
little
arm
from
the
side
of
the
head
had
a
hand
with
a
finger
pointing
for
a
gesture
there
is
a
meeting
place
there
we
decided
now
what
to
do
to
destroy
the
warships
of
your
worlds
i
do
not
like
your
thoughts
they
are
black
i
will
inform
the
great
intelligence
when
he
can
spare
the
thought
for
you
he
added
something
in
the
wandl
tongue
a
worker
came
forward
lifted
him
carefully
held
him
in
the
hollow
of
an
encircling
tentacle
and
with
a
bound
the
worker
sailed
upward
and
was
gone
again
we
stood
through
an
interval
i
noticed
now
that
the
towering
structure
near
us
with
its
storied
balconies
was
not
perpendicular
its
front
curved
up
and
back
it
was
convex
somewhat
in
the
fashion
of
an
irregular
globe
a
foot
ball
with
a
flattened
base
set
here
on
the
ground
the
balconies
were
segments
of
its
front
curve
at
the
top
the
roof
was
as
though
the
ball
had
been
sliced
off
like
a
giant
apple
with
a
slice
gone
for
a
base
and
another
for
the
roof
at
the
bottom
was
a
huge
portal
with
a
glow
of
light
from
within
and
at
the
terraced
balcony
levels
were
lighted
windows
is
that
the
meeting
place
snap
whispered
probably
and
look
to
the
side
of
it
snap
it
was
a
city
there
was
a
vista
of
distance
to
one
side
of
the
great
globe
structure
now
that
our
eyes
were
more
accustomed
to
the
queerness
of
this
night
upon
wandl
we
could
ignore
the
colored
of
the
landing
stage
and
the
disembarking
palisade
upon
which
we
were
standing
gazing
into
the
distance
the
curvature
of
the
surface
of
this
little
world
was
immediately
apparent
the
reddish
firmament
of
stars
came
down
to
meet
the
surface
at
a
horizon
line
which
seemed
about
a
mile
away
spread
upon
this
near
distance
were
a
variety
of
structures
with
little
roads
of
open
space
winding
between
them
most
of
the
buildings
seemed
globular
in
shape
some
were
small
little
round
individual
dwellings
others
were
larger
some
were
tiered
like
half
a
dozen
apples
speared
in
a
row
upon
a
stick
and
set
upright
i
saw
a
ribbon
of
what
might
be
a
river
in
the
distance
with
the
reddish
starlight
glinting
upon
it
to
our
left
half
a
mile
away
perhaps
was
a
row
of
buttes
and
rocks
which
stood
like
a
miniature
range
of
mountains
the
city
seemed
entirely
to
encompass
them
and
every
little
had
upon
its
top
a
globelike
dwelling
lights
were
winking
everywhere
and
figures
bounded
a
hundred
feet
and
more
and
sailed
in
an
arc
coming
down
to
the
ground
to
bound
again
a
row
of
workers
went
by
overhead
not
swimming
or
leaping
but
stiffly
motionless
tiny
opalescent
rays
went
from
them
to
the
ground
as
though
to
give
them
power
five
minutes
of
might
have
passed
while
snap
and
i
gazed
at
this
busy
night
scene
in
this
wandl
city
upon
the
occasion
of
the
landing
of
their
ship
so
triumphantly
returned
from
its
mission
to
earth
as
i
stood
certainly
a
helpless
captive
if
ever
there
was
one
nevertheless
a
strange
sense
of
my
own
power
was
within
me
this
was
so
small
a
world
the
people
were
so
flimsy
with
a
poke
of
my
fist
i
could
kill
any
one
of
these
master
brains
the
workers
seemed
mere
shells
light
and
fragile
even
the
buildings
were
light
and
flimsy
the
little
on
their
sticks
seemed
to
waver
almost
like
nodding
flowers
if
we
ran
amuck
we
could
smash
everything
we
saw
here
on
wandl
we
became
aware
of
molo
approaching
what
a
solid
giant
this
martian
seemed
now
in
the
midst
of
this
buoyant
almost
weightless
city
he
was
still
and
wearing
his
garments
of
ornamented
leather
with
his
brawny
legs
bare
upon
his
feet
were
shoes
his
hands
and
forearms
were
thrust
into
loops
of
small
shields
these
shields
appeared
to
be
constructed
of
a
flexible
framework
covered
with
an
opaque
membrane
they
were
about
two
feet
long
and
half
as
wide
with
a
hand
and
forearm
thrust
into
fabric
loops
the
shield
appeared
to
serve
as
wings
so
that
the
arms
had
more
thrust
against
the
air
he
came
at
us
with
a
sort
of
swimming
stroke
he
landed
somewhat
awkwardly
and
almost
fell
but
gathered
himself
up
and
confronted
us
he
gained
his
balance
and
waved
our
guard
aside
his
gaze
went
to
me
you
are
the
new
prisoner
taken
from
that
wrecked
yes
what
is
your
name
you
are
an
earthman
evidently
yes
i
hesitated
i
had
seen
molo
and
heard
him
talk
back
there
in
greater
new
york
but
he
had
not
seen
me
nor
heard
of
me
probably
gregg
haljan
i
added
i
am
a
skilled
navigator
perhaps
it
was
fortunate
you
saved
me
he
flung
me
a
look
and
there
was
a
tinge
of
amusement
in
it
you
would
save
your
own
skin
now
why
not
you
a
martian
and
this
is
a
war
also
against
mars
his
look
darkened
but
then
again
sardonic
amusement
struck
him
we
shall
see
what
the
great
master
says
there
will
be
a
few
of
our
type
humans
men
and
women
wanted
when
the
worlds
begin
anew
the
great
master
said
so
he
wants
to
study
life
on
earth
as
it
was
before
the
destruction
molo
glance
swept
behind
us
i
turned
to
see
three
figures
approaching
my
heart
pounded
they
were
anita
venza
and
sister
meka
they
came
slowly
trying
to
walk
with
balancing
outstretched
arms
with
a
dozen
curious
wandl
workers
crowding
them
they
came
and
joined
molo
before
us
my
heart
was
pounding
but
i
flung
them
a
curious
impersonal
stare
you
are
here
said
molo
good
we
go
now
he
bent
over
snap
and
me
i
advise
you
make
no
effort
to
leap
away
though
it
may
look
easy
not
me
said
snap
where
would
i
go
alone
in
this
damned
world
i
ca
very
well
leap
back
to
earth
can
i
true
enough
said
molo
you
have
sense
little
fellow
but
i
just
warn
you
the
guard
who
will
watch
you
always
is
very
sharp
of
eye
and
the
weapons
here
bring
very
swift
death
i
could
feel
anita
gaze
upon
me
but
i
did
not
dare
look
her
way
let
go
i
said
you
will
have
no
trouble
with
me
with
molo
leading
us
and
the
giant
guard
following
close
behind
we
made
our
slow
awkward
way
across
the
esplanade
portals
of
the
huge
globular
building
and
within
we
traversed
a
padded
corridor
and
came
presently
upon
the
strangest
interior
scene
i
had
ever
beheld
the
room
was
so
large
that
it
seemed
almost
the
entire
interior
of
the
building
it
was
a
globular
room
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
or
more
in
diameter
the
inner
surface
was
crowded
with
people
it
was
a
huge
hollow
interior
of
a
ball
and
upon
its
concave
surface
a
throng
of
the
workers
were
gathered
they
sat
on
low
seats
at
the
curved
bottom
of
the
room
where
we
entered
and
up
the
sides
and
upon
the
slopes
and
the
top
like
flies
in
a
globe
hanging
head
downward
there
was
no
up
or
down
here
the
slight
gravity
made
little
difference
i
gazed
up
amazed
to
where
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
above
me
head
downward
the
crowd
of
figures
were
calmly
seated
these
were
clinging
of
course
the
of
each
of
them
would
drop
them
down
if
they
let
loose
but
it
required
only
a
slight
effort
between
the
tiers
there
were
narrow
open
aisles
bearing
glowlights
at
intervals
with
molo
leading
us
we
stared
up
the
curving
incline
of
one
of
these
aisles
gregg
good
lord
it
weird
snap
said
where
are
we
going
to
sit
do
speak
to
the
girls
yet
have
you
spoken
to
them
yes
a
little
on
the
ship
they
watching
for
an
opportunity
but
we
have
to
be
cautious
gregg
i
got
so
much
to
tell
you
but
no
chance
the
brains
can
just
about
hear
your
thoughts
we
went
only
a
short
distance
up
the
incline
there
were
vacant
seats
seemingly
held
ready
for
us
our
passage
created
a
commotion
among
the
figures
some
leaped
up
and
over
us
to
get
a
better
look
i
found
that
we
were
clinging
to
the
convex
surface
of
a
small
it
raised
us
some
ten
feet
above
the
floor
there
were
low
seats
with
arms
against
the
of
gravity
i
found
anita
close
beside
me
her
hand
touched
me
but
she
did
not
turn
her
head
or
speak
molo
was
on
my
other
side
i
chanced
to
see
his
feet
they
were
planted
firmly
on
the
floor
he
wore
shoes
equipped
with
suction
pads
no
doubt
which
would
enable
him
like
the
wandlites
to
walk
and
stand
upon
the
upper
inner
surfaces
of
buildings
as
during
the
moments
when
snap
and
i
stood
on
the
landing
esplanade
there
was
so
much
here
that
at
first
i
could
not
encompass
it
but
now
i
began
to
grasp
other
details
of
the
strange
scene
poised
in
almost
exactly
in
the
center
of
the
huge
globular
room
was
a
metal
globe
of
some
thirty
feet
in
diameter
it
was
held
not
by
any
solid
girders
but
by
four
narrow
beams
of
light
which
mounted
to
it
from
widespread
points
of
the
convex
room
upon
the
entire
surface
of
this
globe
a
group
of
masters
were
seated
in
little
seats
upon
resilient
stems
they
swayed
and
nodded
with
movement
there
seemed
to
be
glowing
wires
and
grids
and
beams
of
light
carrying
current
shot
from
the
mechanisms
to
the
heads
of
the
seated
brains
all
the
devices
were
evidently
in
operation
and
upon
this
poised
central
globe
the
attention
of
the
audience
was
directed
molo
bent
over
me
the
great
intelligence
soon
will
see
you
snap
from
the
other
side
of
molo
whispered
what
are
they
doing
up
there
the
faint
hiss
and
throb
of
the
devices
were
audible
i
stared
trying
to
understand
images
and
sounds
invisible
and
inaudible
were
being
received
from
across
the
millions
of
miles
of
space
and
they
were
being
transmuted
within
the
brains
themselves
i
saw
that
discs
were
fastened
upon
the
bulging
foreheads
of
the
brains
upon
which
the
tiny
carrying
the
vibrations
impinged
these
brains
receiving
waves
of
some
unknown
variety
were
within
the
mechanism
of
the
transmuting
translating
the
vibrations
into
things
knowable
they
were
not
seeing
not
hearing
but
what
went
on
millions
of
miles
across
space
again
molo
bent
over
me
they
are
about
to
show
this
audience
what
is
happening
on
the
three
worlds
upon
the
globe
i
saw
now
a
dozen
or
so
balls
of
about
diameter
these
had
been
dark
and
i
had
not
noticed
them
now
they
began
glowing
not
from
wires
carrying
the
current
but
from
the
little
hands
of
the
brains
touching
them
i
stared
at
the
brain
nearest
me
his
flabby
little
arm
was
extended
his
hand
touched
the
gave
it
light
and
color
like
a
of
earth
with
a
crystal
before
her
even
though
i
was
some
sixty
feet
from
it
i
could
see
the
moving
images
clearly
and
recognized
the
scene
the
tappan
interplanetary
stage
ships
were
rising
two
of
our
spaceships
mounting
and
all
in
an
instant
the
scene
blurred
took
form
again
the
spires
and
minarets
of
the
central
canal
extended
like
a
gash
across
the
foreground
the
mushroom
mountains
were
in
a
line
upon
the
horizon
three
martian
slid
up
while
we
watched
and
now
grebhar
the
silver
forest
in
all
its
shining
beauty
where
venza
was
born
the
sunlight
sparkled
on
the
river
a
spaceship
was
rising
in
the
distant
sky
over
the
shining
forest
beyond
anita
i
heard
venza
murmuring
home
if
only
we
were
there
i
could
feel
anita
move
to
silence
her
molo
was
whispering
they
come
but
we
will
be
ready
for
them
another
image
the
allied
ships
gathering
waiting
for
others
to
arrive
a
group
here
of
about
ten
of
our
ships
from
the
three
worlds
poised
waiting
i
was
aware
that
upon
the
protuberance
of
the
where
we
were
sitting
a
door
was
opening
it
slid
or
melted
away
at
our
feet
was
an
opening
downward
into
the
small
interior
of
the
mound
molo
whispered
the
great
master
sit
quiet
he
will
talk
to
us
over
us
now
a
barrage
came
with
a
hiss
a
circular
curtain
of
insulation
the
huge
globular
room
faded
we
were
alone
on
the
mound
snap
molo
myself
anita
venza
and
meka
upon
the
end
of
our
bench
behind
us
stood
our
single
wandlite
guard
with
a
weapon
in
his
shoulder
hand
at
our
feet
an
opening
yawned
into
the
it
was
a
tiny
lighted
room
in
a
seat
a
brain
was
perched
just
below
the
level
of
our
feet
the
great
master
brain
of
wandl
he
was
alone
here
not
attended
by
retinue
no
pomp
and
ceremony
to
usher
us
into
his
presence
no
underlings
obsequiously
bowing
to
mark
him
for
a
great
ruler
we
stared
down
and
the
great
brain
stared
up
at
us
seemingly
equally
curious
his
head
was
a
full
four
feet
in
diameter
the
little
body
sat
in
the
cup
with
dangling
legs
the
clothes
were
ornamented
there
was
a
glowing
device
on
the
chest
he
spoke
with
a
measured
rumble
in
martian
you
are
molo
of
yes
said
molo
you
must
say
great
master
yes
great
master
i
know
about
you
i
know
that
we
trust
you
the
huge
round
eyes
next
fastened
upon
me
then
to
snap
and
back
to
me
the
words
were
english
this
time
men
of
earth
are
you
decided
like
the
martian
to
join
with
us
i
tried
with
sudden
vehemence
to
still
my
thoughts
or
to
change
them
so
that
they
lied
fear
surged
upon
me
could
this
vast
mechanism
of
human
mind
here
at
my
feet
interpret
the
vibrations
of
my
thoughts
could
this
great
master
of
wandl
see
into
my
mind
the
brain
said
you
are
uncertain
you
do
not
want
to
die
no
great
master
we
both
answered
you
shall
not
unless
you
attempt
to
cause
us
trouble
your
thoughts
are
black
he
addressed
molo
have
they
ever
been
read
no
great
master
when
opportunity
comes
have
them
read
he
added
to
snap
and
me
i
plan
to
take
prisoners
my
supreme
rulers
rulers
of
a
neighboring
more
powerful
planet
which
sent
wandl
upon
her
mission
of
conquest
ordered
it
when
your
worlds
are
vacant
of
life
those
who
command
me
will
want
some
of
you
left
alive
to
be
studied
your
thoughts
are
very
black
earthman
i
think
when
they
are
carefully
read
you
will
prove
no
great
advantage
to
us
there
was
irony
in
the
voice
and
upon
the
monstrous
bulging
face
came
the
horrible
travesty
of
a
grin
the
grin
on
the
brain
face
faded
his
interest
went
again
to
molo
that
is
your
sister
the
eyes
swung
to
meka
and
back
yes
great
master
she
is
caring
for
this
and
this
girl
from
venus
yes
great
master
i
am
fond
of
them
i
have
plans
they
are
in
your
charge
martian
i
will
not
interfere
with
you
but
guard
them
well
i
trust
you
and
your
sister
these
others
the
earth
and
the
venus
girl
can
be
of
help
to
me
great
master
how
they
knew
young
men
who
were
in
the
spaceship
service
they
can
tell
me
the
armament
of
men
and
weapons
on
most
of
the
spaceships
which
earth
will
send
against
us
did
molo
really
believe
that
probably
not
but
he
wanted
the
girls
with
him
again
came
that
grotesque
smile
let
them
not
bother
you
martian
you
have
work
to
do
listen
carefully
there
will
be
a
battle
earth
mars
and
venus
may
perhaps
have
a
hundred
ships
i
can
not
bring
destruction
upon
those
three
worlds
in
a
day
we
soon
will
make
contact
with
the
you
placed
on
earth
that
i
will
show
you
but
the
rotation
can
not
be
stopped
at
once
it
will
take
time
the
enemy
ships
might
dare
to
come
to
wandl
but
i
shall
not
wait
for
that
all
my
spaceships
are
very
nearly
ready
if
there
is
to
be
a
battle
it
shall
be
far
from
here
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
enemy
worlds
we
are
at
this
time
about
million
of
your
miles
from
the
earth
a
third
less
than
that
from
mars
and
about
a
third
more
from
venus
i
understand
martian
that
you
are
skilled
in
space
warfare
the
brain
went
on
i
have
given
you
a
vessel
to
command
you
will
be
surprised
to
know
its
name
the
meka
gasped
but
you
destroyed
it
great
master
only
wrecked
it
martian
girl
it
is
repaired
now
you
molo
and
your
sister
to
help
you
who
could
command
it
to
more
advantage
all
your
own
weapons
and
ours
of
wandl
have
been
added
you
may
select
your
crew
is
it
to
your
liking
yes
great
master
you
will
be
housed
in
this
city
wor
in
the
you
occupied
before
keep
your
prisoners
with
you
if
you
like
these
two
earthmen
began
molo
but
he
was
interrupted
settle
that
later
i
do
not
want
the
annoyance
i
was
dimly
conscious
of
a
great
clanging
coming
through
the
curtain
of
barrage
which
was
over
us
the
brain
added
keep
wyk
with
you
to
guard
the
prisoners
he
will
also
attend
your
needs
in
the
battle
martian
i
expect
great
things
of
you
and
your
great
master
you
will
not
be
disappointed
and
prisoners
but
not
too
many
bring
me
a
few
young
specimens
like
these
representative
of
venus
mars
and
the
earth
i
want
both
of
the
sexes
an
equal
number
of
each
yes
great
master
the
warning
signal
is
coming
you
will
now
see
our
first
contact
the
light
at
our
feet
was
fading
it
clung
last
by
the
gruesome
face
of
the
huge
brain
the
goggling
eyes
shone
green
and
as
the
light
in
the
little
dimmed
there
was
in
a
moment
nothing
left
but
those
lurid
green
pools
of
the
brain
eyes
then
i
was
aware
that
the
aperture
at
our
feet
had
closed
over
us
the
barrage
curtain
was
dissipating
sight
and
sound
coming
in
to
us
the
huge
conclave
room
again
became
visible
the
audience
crowding
its
entire
inner
surface
i
suddenly
felt
anita
fingers
twitching
at
my
sleeve
gregg
darling
can
you
hear
me
yes
be
careful
but
molo
was
gazing
up
over
our
heads
the
crowd
was
shifting
bending
so
that
they
all
seemed
gazing
at
their
feet
a
dim
white
radiance
seeming
to
come
from
down
here
somewhere
near
us
lay
in
a
splotch
on
a
segment
of
the
throng
overhead
molo
was
watching
i
whispered
all
right
anita
quick
what
is
it
the
great
control
station
is
not
far
from
here
venza
and
i
have
been
trying
to
find
out
where
it
is
exactly
she
stopped
evidently
fearful
of
meka
then
she
added
gregg
we
have
been
guarded
very
closely
they
not
suspicious
of
us
later
anita
ca
talk
now
no
watch
our
chance
later
i
turned
toward
molo
what
that
up
there
the
transparent
ray
is
opening
the
top
of
the
globe
the
clanging
signal
gong
had
stilled
the
audience
was
hushed
and
expectant
the
white
patch
of
light
overhead
spread
until
it
encompassed
all
the
top
of
the
globe
the
whole
area
was
glowing
the
people
were
white
spectral
shapes
transparent
and
the
top
of
the
globe
was
transparent
i
saw
the
night
sky
with
the
gleaming
reddish
stars
it
was
in
a
moment
as
though
we
were
staring
up
at
a
huge
square
window
orifice
cut
in
the
top
of
the
room
a
broad
vista
of
cloudless
sky
and
stars
was
visible
across
it
like
a
shining
sword
was
a
narrow
opalescent
beam
the
which
i
planted
molo
whispered
triumphantly
our
control
station
will
contact
with
it
now
the
first
contact
earth
was
below
our
angle
of
vision
but
the
beam
from
greater
new
york
sweeping
the
sky
with
the
earth
rotation
was
passing
now
comparatively
close
to
wandl
there
was
an
expectant
moment
then
into
the
sky
leaped
another
ray
narrow
luridly
green
it
swung
up
from
wandl
and
darted
into
space
the
hissing
agonized
electrical
scream
from
it
as
it
burst
through
the
wandl
atmosphere
was
deafening
i
saw
it
strike
the
grip
it
with
a
blinding
burst
of
radiance
up
there
in
the
sky
clinging
pulling
against
the
rotation
of
the
earth
with
a
lever
sixty
million
miles
long
a
moment
of
screaming
sound
in
the
atmosphere
around
us
and
that
conflict
of
light
in
the
sky
then
the
screaming
suddenly
stilled
the
wandl
beam
vanished
the
still
swept
the
heavens
like
a
stiff
upstanding
sword
but
in
that
moment
when
wandl
gripped
it
the
axis
of
the
earth
had
been
changed
a
little
the
rotation
was
slowed
by
a
few
minutes
the
day
and
the
night
on
earth
were
lengthened
it
was
the
beginning
of
earth
desolation
but
when
do
we
eat
snap
demanded
soon
said
molo
i
hope
so
we
were
leaving
the
great
room
as
we
had
come
walking
i
can
only
call
it
that
though
the
word
is
futile
to
describe
our
progress
as
we
made
our
way
to
the
lighted
esplanade
across
its
side
and
into
what
might
have
been
called
a
street
globular
houses
single
or
one
set
upon
another
or
half
a
dozen
swaying
on
a
stick
gardens
of
vegetables
and
flowers
i
saw
what
seemed
to
be
a
round
patch
of
like
a
thick
batch
of
bamboo
it
was
laced
and
latticed
thick
with
vines
a
house
snap
murmured
that
a
house
another
type
of
dwelling
this
patch
of
vegetable
growth
so
flimsy
it
was
all
stirring
with
the
movement
of
the
night
breeze
was
woven
into
circular
thatched
rooms
birds
nests
of
little
dwellings
staring
up
i
seemed
to
see
a
hundred
of
them
ladders
flimsy
vine
platforms
tiny
lights
winking
up
there
in
the
trees
on
a
platform
twenty
feet
above
us
a
group
of
tiny
infant
brains
sat
in
a
gruesome
row
goggling
down
on
us
we
passed
the
tree
patch
again
the
city
seemed
all
a
thin
flexible
metal
the
ground
was
like
a
smooth
rock
surface
alternating
with
small
patches
of
soil
where
things
were
growing
we
walked
in
a
slow
unsteady
line
molo
led
behind
snap
and
me
came
the
girls
ignoring
us
and
at
the
rear
the
giant
guard
stalked
after
us
molo
stopped
at
a
large
we
rest
here
i
will
go
see
that
our
rooms
are
ready
he
gestured
to
his
sister
meka
you
come
with
me
wyk
will
guard
them
we
stood
at
an
oval
doorway
a
worker
came
out
stared
at
us
then
went
back
on
an
upper
balcony
a
brain
was
gazing
down
at
us
i
caught
molo
brawny
arm
wo
you
tell
us
what
going
on
rest
here
with
wyk
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
snap
i
am
going
to
select
my
men
for
battle
when
do
you
go
in
a
few
hours
and
you
taking
us
on
the
ship
molo
where
is
your
that
i
must
find
out
he
gazed
at
us
with
a
slow
faint
smile
not
far
nothing
is
far
on
wandl
i
do
not
know
if
i
will
take
you
on
my
ship
you
might
be
of
help
or
you
might
be
troublesome
the
great
master
wants
prisoners
or
i
would
have
killed
you
long
ago
he
took
his
sister
and
left
us
there
was
a
brief
moment
when
wyk
standing
aside
incuriously
gave
us
opportunity
for
swift
whispers
again
anita
clutched
me
gregg
we
be
separated
now
but
with
molo
gone
venza
and
i
can
get
away
from
meka
venza
whirled
on
us
gregg
listen
snap
be
quiet
if
we
ever
going
to
escape
now
is
the
time
you
get
away
from
wyk
we
handle
meka
and
do
what
snap
demanded
the
control
station
we
find
it
anita
whispered
we
got
to
wreck
it
gregg
stop
those
contacts
it
mean
the
end
of
earth
if
we
do
i
protested
better
try
for
molo
vessel
we
might
be
able
to
navigate
it
escape
from
this
world
the
control
station
first
anita
insisted
gregg
we
know
something
about
it
you
and
snap
with
your
strength
can
demolish
it
and
then
if
we
can
locate
the
it
was
a
desperate
mad
plan
but
there
seemed
nothing
better
the
girls
insisted
now
that
though
they
did
not
know
where
the
control
station
was
located
they
knew
the
details
of
its
interior
its
physical
layout
its
human
operators
in
an
hour
whispered
snap
have
you
got
a
timer
is
it
going
the
little
timers
we
still
had
with
us
were
undoubtedly
operating
differently
from
on
earth
but
they
were
in
agreement
an
hour
by
our
timers
i
whispered
we
make
the
break
then
try
to
find
you
inside
anita
if
you
get
free
of
meka
do
come
out
all
right
we
had
only
a
moment
to
try
and
plan
it
anita
in
an
hour
with
molo
gone
he
came
suddenly
with
a
driving
leap
from
the
doorway
and
dropped
among
us
all
is
ready
come
we
ignored
the
girls
snap
again
protested
that
he
was
hungry
which
indeed
for
me
at
least
was
certainly
the
truth
and
i
was
parched
with
thirst
i
felt
that
this
vaunted
strength
of
my
earth
body
would
not
last
long
without
food
and
drink
we
entered
the
globular
interior
there
were
narrow
corridors
triangular
rooms
a
slatted
incline
leading
upward
to
a
higher
level
the
girls
followed
meka
up
the
incline
molo
and
wyk
herded
us
into
a
nearby
room
you
will
have
your
food
and
drink
here
cause
wyk
no
trouble
and
you
will
be
quite
safe
he
turned
but
snap
plucked
at
him
when
are
you
coming
back
not
too
long
i
said
we
will
cause
you
no
trouble
take
us
on
the
ship
i
will
see
he
murmured
to
wyk
in
martian
then
left
us
the
small
triangular
room
had
no
windows
and
only
the
single
door
wyk
touched
a
mechanism
and
it
slid
closed
the
place
was
a
queer
apartment
indeed
the
floor
was
convex
curving
upward
to
the
walls
the
light
radiance
dimly
glowed
as
though
inherent
to
the
metal
ceiling
there
was
strange
metal
furniture
a
table
and
chairs
high
and
large
bunks
of
a
size
evidently
for
the
workers
the
door
opened
and
a
worker
brought
us
food
and
drink
wyk
sat
apart
and
watched
us
while
we
consumed
the
meal
i
noticed
that
he
seldom
let
himself
get
close
to
us
he
sat
stiffly
upright
with
his
jointed
legs
bent
double
under
him
his
many
arms
and
pincers
hanging
inert
save
the
one
short
with
flexible
fingers
gripping
his
weapon
at
his
waist
and
upon
several
protuberances
of
his
chest
other
weapons
and
devices
were
hanging
snap
gazed
up
from
where
on
the
floor
we
were
ravenously
eating
and
drinking
are
you
hungry
he
asked
wyk
no
you
eat
often
no
an
incurious
taciturn
creature
this
being
snap
whispered
got
to
talk
to
him
make
him
let
us
get
close
that
weapon
how
the
weapon
operated
we
did
not
know
but
that
a
flash
from
it
would
bring
instant
death
we
well
imagined
half
of
that
hour
of
waiting
was
past
i
said
to
wyk
you
would
call
this
night
on
your
world
the
sun
obviously
is
on
the
other
hemisphere
when
will
it
be
day
his
gaze
swung
on
me
his
hollow
voice
deep
from
the
capacious
shell
of
chest
echoed
and
blurred
in
the
room
i
think
wandl
has
no
rotation
now
or
almost
none
he
was
not
as
taciturn
as
he
had
seemed
and
presently
we
had
him
talking
we
learned
several
things
regarding
the
of
wandl
by
which
at
will
the
planet
could
be
rotated
on
its
axis
and
by
which
also
it
could
navigate
space
we
learned
that
the
great
control
station
contained
these
gravitational
mechanisms
as
well
as
the
mechanism
by
which
the
earth
had
been
attacked
but
we
could
not
discover
where
on
wandl
that
station
was
located
then
with
our
meal
finished
snap
rose
to
his
feet
those
arms
of
yours
seem
very
strange
to
us
but
they
must
be
mighty
useful
snap
had
taken
a
cautious
shoving
step
it
wafted
him
directly
toward
the
guard
the
weird
face
of
wyk
with
its
popping
eyes
upon
stems
and
its
upended
mouth
contorted
with
surprise
back
do
come
near
me
he
flung
himself
back
but
struck
the
wall
of
the
room
all
his
arms
were
writhing
alarm
was
in
his
voice
it
was
the
first
time
either
snap
or
i
had
made
an
unexpected
move
and
it
startled
wyk
wait
let
me
go
snap
cried
wyk
longest
arms
were
around
snap
like
the
tentacles
of
an
octopus
and
snap
was
struggling
fighting
we
had
not
intended
this
at
this
time
but
the
opportunity
was
here
i
scrambled
from
the
floor
now
with
the
need
for
powerful
action
the
lack
of
gravity
was
a
tremendous
handicap
i
went
up
with
flailing
arms
into
the
air
wyk
fired
his
weapon
but
it
missed
me
a
soundless
bolt
it
hissed
along
the
curving
wall
of
the
room
the
smell
of
it
was
a
stench
in
my
nostrils
i
hit
the
concave
ceiling
shoved
down
and
like
a
swimmer
in
water
struck
against
the
struggling
bodies
of
snap
and
the
guard
the
waving
little
shoulder
arm
with
the
weapon
came
at
me
snap
shouted
gregg
look
out
i
seized
the
little
arm
it
felt
like
the
shell
of
a
huge
crab
for
a
moment
we
were
all
three
entangled
floundering
unable
to
find
a
foothold
then
suddenly
i
felt
snap
pulling
me
loose
we
got
him
the
body
of
wyk
sank
away
from
us
hit
the
floor
and
lay
still
i
felt
the
floor
under
me
and
snap
clutching
at
me
in
my
hand
i
was
clutching
wyk
little
shoulder
arm
with
fingers
still
gripping
the
weapon
i
had
jerked
it
out
of
his
shoulder
socket
with
a
shudder
i
cast
the
noisome
thing
away
whether
wyk
was
dead
or
not
we
did
not
know
he
lay
on
his
back
the
hideous
face
stared
upward
i
cracked
the
shell
snap
gasped
we
got
to
get
out
of
here
better
try
and
get
the
girls
loose
now
we
wasted
no
further
time
on
wyk
snap
snatched
several
of
his
weapons
and
mechanical
devices
we
stowed
them
hastily
in
our
pockets
one
was
like
another
to
us
we
could
only
guess
at
their
uses
his
shoes
gregg
i
ca
get
the
damn
things
off
him
here
are
shoes
a
small
pile
of
shoes
was
in
a
corner
of
the
room
wide
resilient
suction
soles
built
like
sandals
they
were
very
large
but
the
things
were
so
placed
that
it
seemed
we
could
fasten
them
to
our
boots
but
not
now
snap
we
snatched
up
four
pairs
of
the
shoes
there
seemed
nothing
else
to
do
could
we
get
the
door
open
snap
was
already
fumbling
at
it
accursed
thing
it
wo
give
then
it
slid
open
the
dim
corridor
was
visible
no
one
nothing
out
there
come
on
gregg
in
a
rush
we
went
like
bouncing
rubber
figures
up
the
incline
ladder
snap
watch
out
he
all
but
cracked
his
head
with
an
upward
leap
every
instant
we
expected
to
be
set
upon
there
was
a
terraced
upper
hall
black
with
shadow
dark
ovals
of
doorways
led
into
rooms
no
one
here
as
yet
we
were
not
discovered
we
stood
at
the
intersection
of
two
corridors
one
went
almost
vertically
up
like
a
chimney
extending
into
the
dome
peak
of
the
globe
its
sides
were
latticed
we
could
go
up
it
hand
over
hand
like
monkeys
the
other
sloped
at
an
angle
downward
which
way
snap
whispered
what
do
you
think
got
to
find
them
it
still
lacked
about
five
minutes
of
our
designated
time
but
it
would
not
do
to
burst
in
upon
the
girls
perhaps
to
find
molo
and
guards
there
let
wait
a
minute
listen
see
if
we
ca
get
some
idea
we
were
backed
against
the
corridor
wall
almost
in
darkness
from
the
dark
length
of
the
descending
corridor
came
a
thump
the
sound
of
a
struggle
and
then
a
muffled
scream
venza
and
we
heard
her
words
anita
look
out
for
her
she
got
a
knife
as
though
diving
into
water
snap
and
i
plunged
head
first
into
the
blackness
of
the
corridor
later
we
learned
that
anita
and
venza
had
tried
much
the
same
tactics
on
meka
that
we
had
used
on
wyk
but
their
task
was
more
difficult
she
was
suspicious
of
them
venza
asked
her
where
the
control
station
was
but
she
would
answer
your
brother
said
it
was
just
beyond
the
dark
forest
anita
said
what
is
the
dark
forest
a
place
with
trees
where
no
one
lives
off
that
way
venza
gestured
that
what
molo
said
will
it
be
day
soon
or
will
the
night
keep
on
if
they
cause
wandl
to
rotate
it
will
soon
be
day
an
ironic
look
crossed
meka
face
i
am
in
no
mood
for
answering
more
of
your
silly
questions
save
the
breath
well
if
that
they
way
you
feel
about
it
replied
venza
laughing
we
will
there
not
much
air
in
here
she
shoved
herself
across
the
floor
toward
the
closed
window
get
back
oh
all
right
all
right
perhaps
meka
herself
felt
there
was
not
enough
air
she
stood
waveringly
upright
and
pushed
herself
with
a
slow
leap
for
the
window
her
back
for
that
moment
was
to
anita
and
venza
they
shoved
from
the
floor
whirled
through
the
air
and
were
upon
her
it
was
a
brief
struggle
and
instantly
they
knew
that
they
had
lost
the
huge
martian
whirled
and
flung
them
off
her
upflung
fist
with
a
blow
like
a
man
caught
anita
thigh
and
knocked
her
toward
the
ceiling
she
sank
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
saw
that
venza
had
shoved
back
but
was
standing
upright
anita
bent
double
with
her
feet
braced
against
a
chair
tensed
to
shove
forward
again
at
the
still
unopened
window
meka
crouched
anita
heard
venza
warning
outcry
anita
look
out
for
her
got
a
knife
upon
this
scene
in
a
moment
snap
and
i
came
with
a
rush
the
closed
door
was
not
barred
we
slid
it
down
and
catapulted
through
the
opening
meka
sailed
over
us
i
swam
up
at
her
seized
her
the
knife
ripped
my
blouse
and
slit
the
flesh
of
my
upper
arm
with
a
glancing
blow
then
snap
came
and
struck
against
us
we
sank
to
the
floor
meka
had
fought
silently
but
now
she
was
shouting
i
twisted
her
wrist
seized
the
knife
handle
and
flung
the
knife
away
i
was
aware
of
anita
lunging
to
retrieve
it
and
over
us
venza
appeared
waving
a
metal
chair
as
though
it
were
a
huge
feather
snap
gasped
gregg
get
your
hand
over
her
mouth
shut
her
up
we
had
her
subdued
in
a
moment
but
it
seemed
almost
too
late
outside
the
opened
door
a
distant
shout
sounded
i
shoved
meka
toward
the
door
if
you
do
do
what
i
say
i
kill
you
i
whispered
into
her
ear
what
shall
i
do
there
came
another
shout
closer
now
someone
was
coming
call
out
in
martian
say
there
no
trouble
nothing
wrong
you
were
arguing
with
these
girls
she
did
as
i
commanded
the
voice
down
the
corridor
answered
and
then
subsided
snap
slid
the
door
closed
hurry
we
go
by
the
window
i
dropped
those
damn
shoes
anita
and
venza
tore
their
dark
coats
into
strips
we
bound
and
gagged
meka
laid
her
in
a
corner
of
the
room
we
had
dropped
the
shoes
as
we
came
plunging
through
the
door
oval
we
found
that
we
could
all
fasten
their
things
to
our
feet
i
put
meka
knife
in
my
belt
hurry
all
of
you
snap
was
saying
got
to
get
out
of
here
jump
by
the
window
say
look
at
these
from
a
recess
in
a
corner
of
the
room
venza
appeared
with
an
armful
of
the
small
shields
we
thrust
our
hands
and
forearms
into
their
loops
the
shields
extended
from
a
few
inches
beyond
our
fingers
to
the
elbow
snap
had
slid
the
window
blind
i
bent
over
the
prone
form
of
meka
do
try
to
move
molo
will
release
you
when
he
comes
back
we
gathered
on
the
starlit
balcony
the
city
stretched
around
us
there
was
as
yet
no
alarm
no
swimming
figures
near
here
but
a
distance
away
we
saw
the
towering
conclave
globe
with
its
audience
just
beginning
to
emerge
like
bees
coming
from
a
hive
let
me
go
first
i
held
anita
and
venza
at
the
rail
it
like
swimming
i
suppose
we
get
the
way
of
it
pretty
quickly
i
balanced
on
the
rail
and
then
leaped
off
with
the
others
after
me
we
swam
awkwardly
upward
into
the
reddish
starlight
the
city
structures
dropped
away
showing
in
a
dark
blur
with
winking
lights
over
us
were
the
stars
and
the
cloudless
night
sky
behind
the
flashing
light
beams
of
radiance
at
the
landing
stage
the
figures
fluttering
the
great
globe
all
dropped
swiftly
beneath
a
sharply
curving
horizon
we
had
passed
the
city
a
thousand
feet
below
us
a
dark
forest
stretched
it
was
beyond
this
that
the
control
station
was
located
the
swimming
flight
became
less
awkward
but
it
was
an
effort
in
this
abnormal
wandl
air
snap
and
venza
were
behind
me
anita
was
leading
a
strange
little
figure
white
blouse
long
parted
dark
skirt
from
which
her
legs
kicked
out
as
she
swam
sometimes
half
upon
one
side
or
with
a
breast
stroke
the
braids
of
her
dark
hair
fell
forward
over
her
shoulders
she
was
tiring
i
could
not
miss
it
how
far
had
we
gone
ten
miles
perhaps
there
was
only
a
small
vista
of
this
little
world
visible
at
once
it
was
so
sharply
convex
a
line
of
distant
mountains
was
to
our
left
we
had
crossed
a
river
at
the
forest
edge
i
suppose
we
had
been
half
an
hour
swimming
those
was
daylight
coming
it
seemed
that
the
sideline
of
had
a
little
light
on
them
the
opalescent
beam
from
earth
had
swept
this
portion
of
the
sky
and
was
gone
below
the
horizon
apparently
there
was
no
pursuit
from
the
city
behind
me
venza
panted
say
i
about
finished
ca
we
rest
with
this
altitude
we
could
cease
our
efforts
and
drift
down
it
would
take
several
minutes
we
gathered
together
falling
with
a
slow
drift
toward
the
dark
forest
under
us
the
trees
seemed
huge
and
spindly
a
porous
growth
something
on
the
martian
style
with
huge
leaves
and
a
tangle
of
matter
vines
they
came
mounting
up
at
us
as
we
fell
with
slowly
gathering
speed
shall
we
go
on
i
suggested
yes
but
she
was
tired
and
anita
as
well
girls
i
asked
where
is
the
they
did
not
know
anita
said
perhaps
we
can
land
in
the
trees
and
examine
what
devices
we
have
here
the
girls
had
carefully
watched
molo
upon
several
occasions
they
thought
we
might
find
we
had
a
or
a
couple
of
the
repulsive
rays
with
these
we
could
attain
rapid
flight
without
effort
we
sank
fluttering
into
a
dark
and
tangled
mass
of
the
forest
growth
i
had
understood
that
wandl
was
crowded
with
its
human
population
yet
this
dark
and
silent
forest
evidently
was
uninhabited
we
clung
like
awkward
birds
to
a
swaying
limb
of
a
the
trees
were
close
together
let
see
what
you
got
venza
demanded
we
handed
the
girls
the
various
devices
we
had
taken
from
wyk
most
of
them
were
the
size
of
my
fist
globular
metallic
projectors
like
hand
bombs
ray
cylinders
a
device
with
multiple
barrels
the
size
of
finger
set
in
a
small
circumference
of
a
circular
grid
of
wires
anita
said
i
saw
molo
with
one
of
these
he
killed
an
unwilling
worker
on
the
ship
i
take
a
look
around
snap
said
anxiously
suppose
we
being
followed
give
me
that
weapon
there
was
vegetation
partly
over
us
so
that
the
sky
was
half
obscured
snap
took
the
weapon
and
like
a
monkey
swaying
precariously
he
ran
and
leaped
among
the
upper
branches
crashing
his
way
until
he
could
see
back
toward
the
horizon
beyond
which
lay
the
city
of
wor
we
heard
his
voice
all
clear
nothing
in
sight
you
coming
up
better
get
started
i
put
the
weapons
in
my
pocket
snap
had
one
now
in
the
branches
over
us
i
was
examining
an
electronic
bolt
when
suddenly
there
came
snap
call
gregg
look
out
we
heard
the
hiss
and
saw
the
flash
of
his
bolt
anita
swung
at
me
gregg
see
there
i
followed
her
gesture
and
then
i
knew
why
this
forest
was
shunned
by
humans
the
forest
swarmed
with
living
things
here
in
the
dark
they
had
been
crawling
upon
us
every
branch
of
this
leafy
angle
had
something
staring
at
us
the
darkness
was
suddenly
glowing
with
a
myriad
little
green
torches
which
were
their
eyes
they
all
winked
on
in
an
instant
as
though
at
a
signal
or
at
the
sound
of
snap
shout
and
the
hiss
of
his
bolt
insects
i
suppose
i
should
call
them
that
with
a
glance
i
saw
that
they
were
of
many
sizes
and
shapes
tiny
little
things
with
eyes
like
lanterns
things
of
many
legs
and
some
as
long
as
my
forearm
things
with
eyes
glowing
on
stems
there
was
one
quite
near
us
a
smooth
body
a
round
head
on
top
as
big
as
my
fist
and
these
things
had
heads
like
little
distended
brains
what
horrible
jest
of
nature
this
was
with
miniatures
of
the
wandl
workers
crawling
here
unable
to
stand
erect
groping
with
little
pincers
and
miniature
brains
with
naked
shriveled
bodies
it
seemed
that
the
eyes
of
that
little
brain
were
fixed
on
me
with
a
baleful
green
glare
in
the
darkness
anita
and
venza
were
floundering
to
their
feet
in
horror
they
all
but
slipped
from
the
limb
the
weapons
and
devices
they
had
arranged
there
slid
off
and
went
down
into
the
darkness
unheeded
from
above
us
came
snap
horrified
shouts
and
the
hiss
of
his
bolts
here
i
gasped
my
hand
anita
venza
jump
i
shoved
anita
upward
the
little
eyes
suddenly
were
all
in
movement
advancing
upon
us
anita
floundered
fluttered
got
into
the
air
and
mounted
toward
snap
again
venza
slipped
off
the
limb
i
lunged
and
drew
her
up
green
eyes
nearest
us
came
swooping
i
did
not
dare
fire
a
bolt
it
was
too
close
to
venza
i
flung
the
entire
weapon
at
the
green
eyes
but
i
missed
the
little
thing
bit
venza
arm
she
screamed
and
her
flailing
hand
hit
the
tiny
distended
head
its
hideous
little
scream
mingled
with
hers
it
floated
downward
massed
and
with
gushing
blood
i
struggled
upward
with
the
inert
form
of
venza
under
one
arm
anita
was
mounting
free
snap
came
lunging
down
fired
every
bolt
in
the
damn
weapon
he
saw
the
unconscious
venza
good
god
gregg
never
have
i
heard
such
anguish
in
his
tone
gregg
she
is
one
of
them
bit
her
help
me
he
floundered
up
with
her
a
hundred
feet
above
the
of
that
horrible
forest
the
little
lanterns
of
eyes
down
there
had
all
winked
out
the
open
starlight
was
over
us
anita
came
swimming
then
venza
stirred
she
murmured
all
right
she
had
fainted
it
seemed
nothing
more
but
i
found
her
upper
arm
swelling
she
tried
to
bend
her
body
and
sit
up
but
it
threw
us
all
out
of
balance
lie
straight
snap
murmured
venza
are
you
all
right
yes
why
not
and
then
she
laughed
it
sent
a
shuddering
chill
over
me
what
the
fuss
about
let
get
away
from
here
somebody
will
be
coming
she
was
swimming
now
and
we
let
her
loose
but
stayed
close
by
her
the
reddish
firmament
was
like
an
inverted
bowl
the
curving
wandl
surface
gave
us
a
narrow
little
vista
the
forest
rolling
up
from
the
horizon
in
front
then
we
saw
where
the
forest
seemed
to
end
water
was
beyond
it
a
ribbon
like
a
broad
river
and
beyond
that
frowning
mountains
terraced
and
spired
with
jagged
peaks
snap
and
i
suddenly
recalled
the
gravity
ray
projectors
we
tried
them
found
that
they
would
fling
little
beams
of
two
varieties
pencil
points
of
radiance
they
seemed
to
have
an
effective
range
of
no
more
than
a
few
hundred
feet
i
let
myself
drift
downward
experimenting
the
tiny
beam
struck
the
i
felt
the
projector
pulling
violently
downward
in
my
hand
i
clung
to
it
i
was
being
drawn
swiftly
down
by
the
attractive
gravity
force
of
the
ray
the
forest
rose
rapidly
under
me
i
was
all
but
flung
upon
it
before
i
could
find
the
other
controls
then
the
ray
altered
its
nature
the
projector
in
my
hand
pulled
me
steadily
up
but
after
a
few
hundred
feet
i
felt
i
was
mounting
only
of
my
own
momentum
with
gravity
and
retarding
me
snap
had
tried
similar
experiments
we
rejoined
the
swimming
girls
i
stared
into
venza
face
it
was
pale
but
she
did
not
seem
distressed
she
winked
at
me
how
your
arm
venza
it
hurts
but
i
guess
it
all
right
i
turned
to
snap
i
guess
we
can
work
these
things
get
venza
to
cling
to
you
our
progress
now
was
far
less
difficult
venza
clung
to
snap
ankles
and
anita
to
mine
with
the
repulsing
rays
directed
downward
we
had
a
strong
upward
and
forward
thrust
we
went
forward
with
great
bounds
the
forest
rolled
back
under
us
we
came
over
the
gleaming
river
it
seemed
several
miles
broad
it
appeared
to
have
a
swift
current
i
saw
sunlight
upon
the
mountain
ahead
the
darkness
had
been
paling
now
day
suddenly
burst
upon
us
the
sun
smaller
than
on
earth
mounted
swiftly
up
it
was
a
flattened
distorted
disc
blurred
by
wandl
strange
atmosphere
we
were
in
a
dim
red
daylight
anita
twitched
at
my
ankles
look
back
of
us
we
were
going
up
venza
and
snap
behind
us
were
in
a
descending
arc
above
them
far
back
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
come
two
blobs
were
visible
up
against
the
reddish
day
sky
pursuit
it
seemed
so
the
blobs
went
down
but
came
up
again
traveling
with
rays
like
ourselves
i
called
to
snap
someone
after
us
two
figures
back
there
he
was
shouting
gregg
gregg
help
my
gaze
had
been
on
the
distant
figures
i
saw
now
that
at
the
bottom
of
his
arc
and
starting
upward
again
snap
had
lost
venza
the
impulse
of
his
ray
had
twitched
his
ankle
from
her
grasp
or
had
she
let
loose
he
was
about
a
hundred
feet
above
the
river
and
venza
with
acceleration
downward
unchecked
was
falling
into
it
gregg
help
venza
swim
up
his
frenzied
call
reached
me
as
i
used
the
attractive
ray
and
anita
and
i
whirled
over
and
lunged
downward
gregg
help
venza
use
your
arms
swim
she
was
lying
inert
making
no
effort
to
keep
from
falling
her
body
turned
slowly
she
struck
the
river
surface
but
did
not
sink
instead
she
half
emerged
came
up
and
lay
in
a
crumpled
heap
and
with
its
rapid
current
the
river
carried
her
away
it
was
several
minutes
before
we
could
reach
venza
snap
was
already
there
floundering
on
the
water
awkwardly
maintaining
his
balance
bending
over
venza
gregg
she
unconscious
fainted
again
the
bite
of
that
insect
the
thought
of
it
turned
me
cold
the
river
surface
was
like
a
very
soft
rubber
mattress
the
water
clung
to
us
wet
us
we
could
not
kneel
or
stand
erect
but
in
sitting
down
only
a
few
inches
of
our
bodies
were
submerged
we
floated
like
corks
we
were
so
light
and
so
little
water
did
we
displace
we
struggled
with
venza
across
the
gluey
river
surface
she
had
fallen
near
the
further
shore
rocks
crags
and
strewn
boulders
were
passing
as
the
current
swept
us
along
at
a
speed
of
about
ten
miles
an
hour
she
lay
in
our
arms
eyes
closed
her
face
pallid
but
calm
she
seemed
to
breathe
rapidly
but
that
on
wandl
was
normal
we
landed
on
the
rocky
shore
it
was
still
daylight
the
blurred
sun
was
winging
across
the
zenith
so
swiftly
that
its
movement
was
visible
wandl
had
been
suddenly
endowed
with
axial
rotation
even
in
these
few
minutes
the
day
was
past
its
noon
on
the
distant
mountain
peaks
looming
above
the
nearby
horizon
it
seemed
that
the
sheen
of
coming
night
was
mingled
with
the
red
sunlight
anita
and
snap
laid
venza
on
the
rocks
i
suddenly
remembered
the
two
blobs
in
the
sky
behind
us
which
had
seemed
to
be
following
i
stood
gazing
across
the
river
the
red
sky
there
seemed
empty
thank
god
she
reviving
snap
called
at
me
and
i
joined
them
venza
was
stirring
color
was
coming
into
her
cheeks
her
lips
were
murmuring
as
though
she
were
talking
in
her
sleep
then
she
opened
her
eyes
her
gaze
fixed
on
us
as
we
bent
over
her
why
what
the
matter
where
are
we
i
thought
we
were
in
the
snap
do
look
at
me
like
that
dear
i
all
right
only
confused
she
could
remember
nothing
since
that
gruesome
thing
bit
into
her
arm
but
the
attack
of
its
poison
in
her
veins
seemed
definitely
over
we
sat
with
her
soothing
her
explaining
what
had
happened
and
she
was
wholly
rational
her
strength
came
back
her
mind
cleared
the
brief
red
day
came
to
its
close
the
sun
plunged
below
the
horizon
the
stars
winked
into
being
the
wandl
night
again
was
here
and
now
we
saw
that
the
whole
firmament
was
swinging
the
rotation
made
visible
the
darkness
leaped
around
us
shadows
filled
the
rock
hollows
the
caves
and
recesses
of
this
rocky
shore
turned
black
with
darkness
and
in
the
sky
now
we
saw
another
of
those
familiar
opalescent
beams
this
was
the
one
from
mars
we
could
identify
the
red
disc
of
the
planet
and
then
from
the
mountains
ahead
of
us
but
still
below
our
horizon
the
wandl
control
station
shot
its
attacking
beam
upward
again
there
was
that
conflict
in
the
sky
the
axis
of
mars
was
being
altered
its
rotation
slowed
we
could
see
now
that
we
were
much
nearer
than
before
to
the
control
station
it
seemed
only
about
twenty
miles
ahead
of
us
the
scream
from
it
was
deafening
the
wandl
beam
died
presently
the
electrical
scream
from
the
control
station
was
stilled
the
earth
axis
had
been
altered
now
mars
and
next
would
be
venus
a
few
more
of
these
gravitational
attacks
and
then
the
helpless
planets
with
rotation
checked
would
be
towed
away
by
wandl
out
into
the
deadly
cold
of
interstellar
space
anita
abruptly
gave
a
startled
outcry
the
four
of
us
sitting
in
a
group
had
no
time
to
rise
from
behind
a
dark
crag
nearby
two
figures
appeared
the
starlight
showed
them
clearly
molo
and
wyk
they
lunged
forward
at
us
we
were
unarmed
i
had
flung
my
weapon
at
the
thing
in
the
forest
and
snap
had
exhausted
all
his
bolts
firing
at
the
multitude
of
green
eyes
molo
and
wyk
came
with
a
dive
through
the
air
two
tiny
flashes
leaped
from
them
to
the
rocks
behind
them
and
flung
them
forward
snap
and
i
seized
venza
and
anita
it
was
a
second
of
confusion
then
i
saw
we
would
not
be
able
to
rise
in
time
the
driving
oncoming
figures
were
no
more
than
twenty
feet
away
protect
venza
snap
get
her
behind
you
snap
shoved
venza
behind
him
i
got
myself
in
front
of
anita
we
had
almost
gained
our
feet
i
tried
to
thrust
anita
and
myself
violently
upward
we
rose
but
only
a
few
feet
and
then
we
were
struck
by
the
oncoming
body
of
wyk
like
a
huge
insect
lunging
in
against
us
the
two
longest
tentacle
arms
wrapped
around
us
anita
twisted
and
kicked
the
gruesome
goggling
face
of
wyk
thrust
itself
almost
into
mine
the
hollow
voice
panted
i
have
you
fast
one
of
my
arms
was
free
and
i
struck
with
my
fist
at
the
gaping
upended
mouth
there
was
a
crack
my
fist
sank
through
the
shell
a
cold
sticky
ooze
spurted
out
wyk
screamed
his
encircling
arms
fell
away
the
grisly
smashed
face
was
white
with
ooze
and
pulp
where
my
fist
had
gone
in
we
had
sunk
back
to
the
rocks
i
kicked
the
dead
body
of
wyk
away
anita
swim
up
no
sinking
beside
us
were
the
flailing
bodies
of
molo
snap
and
venza
were
drifting
down
they
seemed
intermingled
snap
was
shouting
no
you
do
drop
that
i
leaped
for
them
something
long
and
thin
and
glowing
was
dangling
from
molo
hand
he
broke
loose
from
the
struggling
snap
and
venza
his
feet
struck
the
rocks
and
he
shoved
himself
backward
my
leap
had
carried
me
too
high
i
saw
that
in
his
hand
was
a
length
of
glowing
wire
he
whirled
it
the
weight
on
its
end
described
an
arc
and
then
he
flung
the
handle
the
weighted
wire
struck
venza
and
snap
just
as
their
repulsive
ray
shot
down
against
the
rocks
and
shoved
them
upward
the
whirling
wire
wrapped
itself
around
them
bound
them
together
its
glow
vanished
snap
had
been
shouting
gregg
come
up
but
it
died
in
his
throat
all
this
while
in
those
few
seconds
i
was
vaulting
over
molo
trying
to
get
back
to
the
ground
to
leap
again
i
saw
that
anita
was
crawling
on
the
rocks
my
gravity
cylinder
was
at
my
belt
i
had
jammed
it
there
to
leave
my
hands
free
just
as
wyk
struck
me
i
saw
that
snap
and
venza
wrapped
together
by
the
wire
had
dropped
their
gravity
projector
their
entwined
figures
went
up
some
fifty
feet
and
stopped
then
began
drifting
down
molo
was
shouting
you
gregg
haljan
now
for
you
i
struck
the
rocks
and
fell
twenty
feet
beyond
him
i
jerked
out
my
gravity
projector
but
i
did
not
know
what
i
wanted
to
do
with
it
and
in
that
second
i
saw
that
the
standing
molo
was
aiming
at
me
directly
over
my
head
the
inert
bound
bodies
of
venza
and
snap
were
falling
a
flash
leaped
over
the
dark
rocks
from
molo
there
was
a
when
i
thought
it
was
the
end
of
me
but
i
was
still
alive
the
bodies
of
venza
and
snap
struck
my
head
and
shoulders
knocked
me
down
i
felt
molo
ray
upon
me
not
death
but
only
his
gravity
ray
like
a
giant
hand
pulling
me
apparently
he
wanted
us
alive
i
was
scrambling
on
the
rocks
entangled
with
venza
and
snap
molo
radiance
clung
all
three
of
us
went
tumbling
forward
toward
him
i
flashed
my
own
ray
but
i
was
rolling
end
over
end
and
it
went
wild
i
dropped
it
saw
molo
beam
vanish
saw
his
upright
standing
figure
towering
above
me
snap
venza
and
i
were
in
a
heap
at
his
feet
he
leaned
down
and
seized
me
now
gregg
haljan
i
will
teach
you
not
to
try
escaping
like
this
with
the
huge
muscular
martian
gripping
me
his
fist
striking
for
my
face
but
missing
and
hitting
my
shoulder
this
was
a
semblance
of
normality
i
could
understand
fighting
like
this
i
wrapped
my
legs
around
him
my
fingers
reached
for
his
brawny
throat
as
he
kicked
us
into
the
air
free
of
the
entangling
bodies
of
snap
and
venza
we
rose
a
few
feet
and
sank
back
gripping
each
other
lunging
and
striking
he
was
very
powerful
this
martian
i
caught
the
round
pillar
of
his
throat
with
my
hands
for
an
instant
i
shut
off
his
wind
but
i
could
not
hold
the
grip
he
struck
me
a
glancing
blow
in
the
face
then
the
heel
of
his
hand
was
under
my
chin
it
forced
back
my
head
broke
my
hold
on
his
throat
with
returning
breath
he
gasped
an
inhalation
and
i
heard
his
exulting
words
you
are
not
strong
enough
we
rolled
and
bumped
over
the
rocks
i
caught
a
blow
from
his
fists
full
in
my
face
it
was
almost
the
end
i
felt
my
strength
going
he
laughed
as
he
struck
away
my
answering
swing
i
was
on
my
back
against
the
rocks
with
his
body
on
top
of
me
then
beyond
and
behind
his
hulking
shoulder
silhouetted
against
the
sky
i
saw
anita
rise
up
she
was
lifting
a
jagged
gray
mass
of
stone
full
four
feet
in
diameter
she
poised
it
then
crashed
it
down
on
molo
head
he
sank
away
from
me
his
arms
relaxed
the
boulder
rolled
beside
him
it
was
over
now
wyk
was
dead
his
gruesome
body
with
its
smashed
face
lay
near
us
molo
was
unconscious
breathing
heavily
lying
motionless
with
a
wound
on
the
back
of
his
head
the
blood
welling
out
matting
his
hair
anita
and
i
were
uninjured
victorious
but
what
a
hollow
victory
on
the
rocks
here
bound
together
by
that
strange
wire
snap
and
venza
lay
inert
we
bent
over
them
the
wire
was
cold
to
the
touch
now
it
resisted
our
efforts
to
untwine
it
we
pulled
frantically
as
we
pleaded
snap
speak
to
us
venza
ca
you
speak
their
eyes
were
open
i
was
aware
that
there
was
no
starlight
above
us
but
instead
a
lurid
sky
of
flying
clouds
shot
with
a
greenish
cast
the
darkness
here
was
green
the
glow
of
it
struck
upon
the
staring
eyes
of
venza
and
snap
it
seemed
that
there
was
intelligence
in
those
eyes
snap
ca
you
hear
us
his
eyelids
came
down
and
up
again
slowly
as
though
by
a
horrible
effort
can
you
move
snap
his
right
eyelid
moved
was
his
answer
no
anita
and
i
had
never
felt
so
horrible
a
sense
of
aloneness
as
that
which
swept
us
in
those
succeeding
minutes
a
breeze
was
springing
up
in
the
lurid
green
night
it
came
from
the
mountains
it
wafted
across
the
nearby
river
rippling
the
surface
which
was
now
green
and
sullen
we
did
not
know
where
to
go
what
to
do
we
found
at
last
that
we
could
untwist
the
stiffly
clinging
wire
we
laid
venza
and
snap
on
the
rocks
about
thirty
feet
back
from
the
river
the
glowing
wire
had
burned
their
clothes
only
a
little
as
the
current
was
absorbed
by
the
contact
with
their
bodies
snap
are
you
in
pain
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
trying
to
talk
to
me
anita
rose
from
venza
oh
gregg
what
shall
we
do
ca
we
carry
them
but
where
to
what
purpose
wild
thoughts
thronged
me
wandl
control
station
bringing
chaos
and
death
upon
earth
mars
and
venus
what
was
that
now
to
me
i
thought
of
molo
ship
anita
if
we
can
get
to
the
seize
it
and
escape
from
this
world
carry
snap
and
venza
there
now
but
we
do
know
where
it
is
can
we
make
molo
lead
us
but
molo
lay
unconscious
i
could
not
rouse
him
anita
and
i
were
so
alone
we
clung
together
gregg
look
at
that
sky
the
mounting
wind
was
tugging
at
us
it
whined
through
the
dark
mountain
defiles
surged
out
over
the
river
where
the
water
now
was
beginning
to
toss
with
waves
crossing
the
swift
current
the
sky
was
shot
with
green
shafts
of
radiance
over
us
the
lowering
leaden
clouds
were
scudding
riding
the
wind
it
burst
now
upon
us
i
found
suddenly
that
anita
and
i
were
bracing
against
it
a
puff
dislodged
us
so
that
we
were
blown
a
dozen
feet
bringing
up
against
a
crag
as
though
we
were
balloons
anita
this
wind
we
ca
maintain
ourselves
here
we
horror
checked
me
at
the
thought
of
venza
and
snap
lying
there
on
the
rocks
we
saw
the
body
of
wyk
like
a
great
dried
insect
lifted
by
the
wind
whirled
like
a
brown
leaf
over
and
over
and
carried
away
a
little
pebble
came
hurtling
and
struck
me
then
a
rain
of
pebbles
like
hailstones
was
pelting
at
us
the
storm
was
probably
caused
by
the
axial
rotation
of
wandl
the
upon
earth
had
been
attacked
by
the
wandl
control
station
without
axial
rotation
but
to
attack
the
beam
from
mars
a
manipulation
of
wandl
was
necessary
the
planet
rotation
was
started
and
suddenly
checked
it
remained
night
now
here
in
this
hemisphere
perhaps
there
were
natural
storm
tendencies
here
perhaps
the
operators
of
the
control
station
were
unduly
eager
manipulating
the
rotation
too
suddenly
at
all
events
it
was
frightening
i
shouted
above
its
whine
and
the
clatter
of
the
pebbles
hold
onto
me
we
get
to
venza
and
snap
we
reached
the
two
inert
forms
where
they
had
blown
into
a
niche
between
two
boulders
ca
stay
here
anita
no
if
it
begins
again
over
there
a
cave
we
got
venza
and
snap
into
it
just
as
another
gust
came
with
a
rain
of
dirt
and
loose
stones
pelting
past
outside
suddenly
i
thought
of
molo
anita
stay
here
must
get
to
molo
gregg
no
i
must
if
we
can
bring
him
to
consciousness
make
him
tell
us
where
the
is
i
flung
off
her
restraining
hold
the
wind
had
eased
up
i
leaped
out
into
it
swimming
the
rocks
slid
by
close
under
me
in
a
swift
sidewise
drift
in
a
moment
i
would
be
carried
out
over
the
river
it
was
a
chaos
of
green
windswept
darkness
but
there
was
bursting
light
now
overhead
and
rumbling
claps
like
thunder
i
saw
molo
body
where
the
wind
held
him
pinned
against
the
side
of
a
flat
rock
butte
and
dove
for
him
swimming
down
frantically
until
i
struck
against
the
rock
with
a
blow
that
almost
knocked
the
breath
from
me
molo
was
still
obviously
unconscious
how
long
it
took
me
to
get
back
to
anita
floundering
with
body
i
do
not
know
i
managed
to
keep
against
the
ground
was
blown
back
and
struggled
forward
again
the
wind
came
with
strange
puffs
in
one
of
the
lulls
i
hauled
molo
through
the
air
and
into
the
cave
gregg
anita
held
to
me
her
arms
around
me
gregg
dear
you
were
gone
so
long
i
was
battered
and
bruised
and
breathless
the
cave
mouth
was
like
a
tunnel
leading
downward
into
blackness
gregg
i
put
venza
and
snap
here
they
lay
side
by
side
like
two
dead
bodies
here
in
the
greenish
darkness
we
placed
molo
with
them
together
anita
and
i
crouched
beside
them
clinging
to
each
other
listening
to
the
wild
sweep
of
the
wind
outside
the
storm
had
burst
into
full
fury
now
it
would
whirl
us
away
like
feathers
outside
there
now
the
lightning
and
thunder
hissed
and
crashed
stones
and
boulders
were
being
flung
like
hailstones
this
flimsy
weightless
world
it
seemed
as
though
the
rocks
here
on
which
we
were
crouching
would
be
shifted
and
carried
away
gregg
gregg
is
this
the
end
a
mass
of
rocks
fell
at
the
opening
closing
it
so
that
we
were
buried
here
in
the
darkness
anita
my
darling
i
will
never
stop
loving
you
darkness
with
her
arms
around
me
and
a
shuddering
world
outside
but
here
only
anita
and
her
soft
arms
gregg
horror
was
in
her
voice
then
i
saw
what
she
was
seeing
it
was
not
just
anita
and
i
buried
here
in
the
darkness
with
the
bodies
of
snap
and
venza
and
molo
something
else
was
here
from
the
blackness
of
the
cave
two
green
glowing
eyes
were
staring
their
radiance
showed
me
the
outlines
of
a
distended
head
an
insane
thing
but
it
was
not
another
of
the
forest
insects
this
seemed
to
be
an
animal
the
glow
of
its
distended
head
disclosed
a
lythe
horizontal
body
seemingly
solid
and
muscled
a
chattering
insane
animal
here
in
the
dark
with
us
we
heard
mouthing
mumbling
words
and
an
eerie
cackling
laugh
as
it
came
padding
toward
us
the
thing
in
the
cave
stared
at
us
as
we
clung
together
in
the
darkness
transfixed
for
a
moment
by
horror
the
distended
head
ghastly
of
face
with
its
green
glowing
eyes
wobbled
upon
a
long
spindly
neck
the
eyes
seemed
luminous
of
their
own
internal
light
the
radiance
from
them
faintly
lighted
the
black
cave
so
we
were
able
to
see
its
tawny
hairy
body
it
was
long
sleek
the
size
of
an
earth
leopard
a
muscled
body
with
ponderable
weight
it
was
moving
toward
us
padding
on
the
rocks
i
recovered
my
wits
and
shoved
anita
behind
me
i
crouched
on
one
knee
there
was
no
escape
nowhere
to
run
this
tunnel
was
blocked
by
a
fallen
rock
mass
behind
us
with
the
wild
storm
raging
outside
the
thing
was
some
twenty
feet
away
where
the
tunnel
broadened
into
a
black
cave
of
unknown
size
beside
me
snap
and
venza
lay
inert
the
molo
with
them
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
crouch
here
and
protect
anita
i
waved
my
arms
shouted
above
the
outside
surge
of
the
storm
my
voice
reverberated
with
a
muffled
roar
in
this
subterranean
darkness
get
back
back
back
away
from
me
it
stopped
round
ears
stood
up
from
the
bloated
head
then
it
laughed
again
i
felt
anita
shoving
a
rock
at
my
hand
a
chunk
of
rock
the
size
of
my
head
its
face
gregg
aim
for
its
face
the
rock
felt
like
a
ball
of
cork
i
flung
it
and
hit
the
thing
on
the
body
its
laughter
checked
abruptly
it
crouched
as
though
gathering
for
a
spring
and
then
i
thought
of
my
gravity
projector
i
flashed
on
the
repulsive
ray
to
its
full
intensity
the
tawny
body
leaped
it
came
hurtling
but
my
beam
met
it
in
for
a
second
i
thought
that
i
had
been
too
late
the
thing
was
clawing
the
air
its
momentum
carried
it
against
the
push
of
my
ray
for
an
instant
it
hung
snarling
and
then
laughed
that
wild
laugh
the
ray
forced
it
back
it
receded
through
the
air
back
across
the
blackness
of
the
cave
gathering
speed
until
in
a
moment
it
brought
up
against
the
opposite
wall
some
forty
feet
away
there
it
hung
pinned
as
i
held
the
ray
upon
it
the
body
had
struck
the
rocky
wall
but
the
head
was
uninjured
it
was
writhing
and
twisting
the
cave
was
filled
with
the
reverberations
of
its
screams
over
the
screams
i
heard
another
voice
oh
gregg
where
are
you
snap
behind
me
anita
was
moving
sidewise
toward
where
snap
and
venza
were
lying
the
thing
pinned
in
my
light
stopped
its
screaming
with
curiosity
perhaps
at
this
new
sound
snap
we
here
snap
then
venza
voice
it
letting
me
talk
we
better
now
they
were
recovering
anita
was
bending
over
them
gregg
they
all
right
the
shock
is
wearing
off
thank
god
but
i
did
not
dare
move
to
them
my
light
on
the
snarling
thing
across
the
cave
held
it
but
i
did
not
dare
to
relax
my
attention
i
called
stay
with
them
anita
i
moved
slowly
forward
holding
the
beam
steady
the
cave
floor
was
littered
with
loose
stones
and
boulders
ten
feet
from
the
pinned
animal
i
selected
a
great
chunk
of
rock
it
towered
in
my
hand
but
the
weight
of
it
was
only
a
few
pounds
the
gravity
held
the
animal
as
though
i
had
pinned
it
by
a
pole
from
the
distance
of
a
few
feet
i
heaved
the
boulder
the
palpitating
head
mashed
against
the
wall
the
body
and
the
pulp
of
the
head
and
the
boulder
sank
to
the
floor
when
i
removed
the
beam
snap
thank
god
you
recovered
and
you
venza
anita
and
i
sat
with
them
they
had
been
fully
conscious
all
the
while
but
they
were
out
of
it
now
an
hour
passed
while
we
sat
crouched
listening
to
the
storm
it
letting
up
venza
said
out
of
a
silence
anita
was
sitting
over
the
prone
form
of
molo
he
had
stirred
and
mumbled
several
times
let
see
if
we
can
get
out
of
here
snap
suggested
rocks
had
fallen
and
blocked
the
only
exit
from
the
cave
but
to
our
strength
even
the
hugest
of
the
rocks
was
movable
shall
we
try
it
now
gregg
as
though
we
were
elephants
heaving
and
pushing
we
struggled
with
the
litter
choking
the
passage
there
was
a
danger
that
the
whole
thing
would
cave
in
on
us
but
we
were
careful
of
that
we
tossed
the
small
rocks
aside
like
pebbles
there
was
one
main
mass
together
we
pulled
and
tugged
and
shifted
it
a
small
opening
was
disclosed
large
enough
for
our
bodies
the
wind
puffed
in
through
it
the
girls
called
us
molo
had
regained
consciousness
the
blow
from
the
rock
had
only
stunned
him
we
bound
his
wrists
with
a
portion
of
his
belt
which
we
cut
into
strips
what
is
it
you
do
with
me
is
wyk
dead
yes
he
lay
silent
and
sullen
look
here
molo
we
going
to
get
out
of
this
and
you
going
to
help
us
if
you
do
the
knife
which
we
had
taken
from
him
to
cut
his
belt
was
in
my
hand
i
drew
its
blade
lightly
across
his
throat
will
you
talk
freely
and
truthfully
yes
i
will
talk
the
truth
do
you
know
where
the
control
station
is
located
yes
where
not
far
the
hell
with
that
snap
burst
out
get
it
meshed
in
your
mind
molo
that
we
in
no
mood
for
talk
like
that
how
far
is
it
on
earth
you
would
call
it
ten
miles
in
these
mountains
he
told
us
it
was
said
anita
underground
do
you
know
where
your
ship
is
i
persisted
he
told
us
that
it
was
some
thirty
miles
in
another
direction
not
in
the
mountains
but
in
the
outskirts
of
a
city
like
wor
it
was
equipped
and
ready
for
flight
all
but
the
assembling
of
its
crew
and
now
we
had
weapons
molo
was
carrying
several
of
the
gravity
projectors
two
small
searchlight
beams
little
hand
torches
and
three
electronic
of
size
hope
filled
us
the
storm
was
abating
we
could
creep
upon
the
single
small
control
room
of
the
gravity
station
where
usually
but
two
operators
were
stationed
the
delicate
mechanisms
there
could
be
wrecked
and
then
we
would
seize
the
no
one
would
be
on
the
lookout
for
us
the
fact
that
molo
prisoners
had
escaped
was
as
yet
unknown
he
and
wyk
had
not
dared
tell
it
meka
was
back
there
waiting
our
absence
from
the
globe
dwelling
might
have
been
discovered
but
meka
would
say
that
we
were
with
molo
she
was
waiting
there
hoping
that
her
brother
and
wyk
would
recapture
us
all
this
we
dragged
piecemeal
from
molo
snap
and
i
shared
the
gravity
projectors
and
the
small
electronic
guns
let
get
started
gregg
the
storm
seems
over
it
was
we
found
the
starry
night
again
outside
the
river
was
lashed
white
with
waves
but
they
were
spent
there
was
only
a
mild
warm
breeze
remaining
molo
legs
were
free
but
his
wrists
were
lashed
behind
him
i
hooked
an
arm
under
his
holding
him
like
a
huge
but
light
oblong
bundle
snap
called
ready
gregg
yes
snap
flashed
on
his
gravity
ray
and
mounted
with
the
girls
clinging
to
his
ankles
then
i
followed
with
molo
by
great
arching
swoops
we
swung
up
into
the
frowning
tumbled
mountains
this
will
be
the
place
to
land
gregg
haljan
we
were
drifting
down
upon
a
barren
region
of
naked
crags
dark
frowning
broken
and
tumbled
as
though
by
some
great
cataclysm
of
nature
mountains
upon
the
moon
could
not
be
more
desolate
of
aspect
we
landed
on
the
rocks
the
heights
here
had
a
sheen
from
the
starlight
we
had
seen
frequent
evidence
of
the
storm
and
it
showed
here
rocks
were
abnormally
piled
in
drifts
smooth
areas
showed
where
the
pebbles
stones
and
boulders
had
been
swept
away
by
the
wind
snap
and
the
girls
landed
beside
us
we
spoke
softly
none
of
us
not
even
molo
knew
how
far
sound
would
carry
in
this
air
where
is
the
place
from
here
snap
demanded
off
there
molo
spoke
with
docile
guarded
softness
he
gestured
with
his
head
and
shoulder
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
over
these
uplands
the
broken
land
went
down
in
a
sharp
depression
it
is
there
i
think
from
here
we
should
go
on
the
ground
there
is
no
guard
and
i
think
seldom
is
anyone
on
top
if
i
help
you
now
if
we
should
wreck
the
gravity
controls
then
wandl
will
be
helpless
to
navigate
space
or
to
interfere
with
the
rotation
of
earth
mars
and
venus
the
allied
worlds
might
then
defeat
the
wandl
ships
in
battle
if
that
happened
perhaps
your
governments
because
of
my
help
here
would
forgive
what
my
has
done
your
piracy
i
said
yes
i
am
outlawed
i
might
be
reinstated
if
you
would
speak
the
good
words
for
me
maybe
maybe
even
they
would
reward
me
you
think
so
gregg
haljan
he
wanted
to
be
on
the
winning
side
this
suited
us
let
try
it
and
see
molo
i
speak
plenty
of
good
words
for
you
now
as
we
landed
on
the
uplands
he
said
you
will
do
best
to
free
my
hands
oh
no
snap
declared
but
i
am
a
good
fighter
something
unexpected
might
come
too
good
a
fighter
i
said
we
trust
you
because
we
have
to
molo
but
no
more
than
is
necessary
a
small
recess
in
the
rocks
was
near
us
we
put
molo
there
with
his
hands
bound
and
with
anita
and
venza
to
guard
him
venza
held
the
electronic
gun
she
knew
how
to
fire
it
the
girls
crouched
in
a
depression
about
twenty
feet
away
they
could
see
molo
plainly
if
he
moved
a
flash
of
the
gun
would
kill
him
he
knew
that
the
girls
gazed
at
us
as
we
were
ready
to
start
gregg
snap
good
luck
we
wo
be
long
sit
where
you
are
snap
touched
venza
shoulder
for
his
listen
venza
molo
has
already
told
us
enough
to
enable
us
to
find
the
ship
if
he
tries
anything
kill
him
right
she
said
we
left
them
a
minute
or
two
cautiously
shoving
ourselves
along
the
rocks
and
we
were
crouching
there
the
cauldron
was
about
two
hundred
feet
broad
and
fifty
feet
deep
an
irregular
circular
bowl
the
starlight
gleamed
on
it
and
there
were
dots
of
small
artificial
light
we
saw
a
group
of
small
metal
buildings
very
low
and
squat
like
balls
mashed
down
flattened
in
a
bulging
between
them
were
tiny
skeleton
towers
the
towers
twice
the
height
of
a
man
were
spread
at
irregular
intervals
in
a
circle
with
a
group
of
three
or
four
in
the
center
there
seemed
some
twenty
of
them
taut
wires
connected
their
tops
each
tower
with
every
other
so
that
the
wires
were
a
lacework
above
the
small
disc
buildings
the
bottoms
of
the
towers
were
grounded
with
electrical
contacts
and
every
tower
had
a
ground
connection
with
each
other
by
means
of
cables
far
to
one
side
across
the
bowl
from
us
was
a
single
with
lighted
windows
from
its
ground
doorway
a
narrow
metal
catwalk
extended
like
a
sidewalk
on
the
ground
winding
and
branching
among
the
towers
and
discs
this
was
the
exterior
of
the
wandl
gravity
station
it
lay
silent
and
dark
save
for
the
starlight
and
the
little
lights
on
the
towers
no
sign
of
humans
then
we
saw
movement
in
the
a
man
came
to
the
doorway
gazed
at
the
sky
and
went
back
i
whispered
which
is
the
best
entrance
to
the
underground
rooms
we
saw
where
at
several
points
the
winding
catwalk
terminated
in
low
kiosks
giving
ingress
downward
one
was
on
our
slope
of
the
cauldron
that
the
one
we
try
snap
murmured
he
stopped
suddenly
the
top
of
the
distant
was
glowing
a
little
round
patch
there
was
radiant
like
a
lighted
window
a
transparent
ray
was
coming
from
inside
the
operators
within
this
globe
were
observing
the
sky
training
instruments
upon
it
no
doubt
and
now
we
saw
in
the
sky
the
third
of
those
beams
it
had
probably
been
visible
there
for
some
time
but
we
had
not
noticed
it
that
venus
i
murmured
it
seemed
so
a
blurred
star
red
in
this
atmosphere
was
close
above
the
horizon
the
stood
out
from
it
sweeping
up
to
the
zenith
the
gravity
station
here
was
about
to
make
contact
with
the
venus
beam
we
heard
a
muffled
siren
a
signal
echoing
from
the
subterranean
control
rooms
the
current
went
into
all
these
wires
and
towers
and
ground
discs
the
hissing
and
throbbing
hum
of
it
was
audible
the
discs
and
towers
were
glowing
red
at
first
then
violet
then
that
milky
opalescent
white
the
overhead
were
snapping
with
a
myriad
of
tiny
jumping
sparks
i
saw
now
that
the
top
of
each
tower
was
a
grid
of
radiant
wires
a
circular
projector
with
a
mirror
reflector
close
beneath
it
and
a
series
of
prisms
and
lenses
just
above
it
all
glowed
opalescent
in
a
moment
a
dazzling
glare
then
the
tower
tops
were
swinging
the
lights
from
them
had
reached
the
intensity
of
an
upflung
beam
and
the
projectors
were
swinging
to
focus
the
beam
inward
the
focal
point
seemed
about
a
thousand
feet
overhead
all
the
beams
merged
there
and
guided
by
the
towers
directly
underneath
a
single
shaft
was
standing
into
the
sky
the
entire
cauldron
depression
was
now
a
blinding
mass
of
opalescent
light
we
could
see
nothing
but
the
inferno
of
glare
it
painted
the
rocks
up
here
on
the
rim
so
that
we
shrank
back
shaded
our
eyes
and
gazed
into
the
sky
and
from
the
cauldron
the
hum
and
the
hiss
of
the
current
the
snapping
of
sparks
were
all
lost
in
a
wild
electrical
screaming
turmoil
overhead
we
saw
the
wandl
beam
from
venus
apparently
this
control
station
had
two
functions
the
control
of
the
planet
movements
its
axial
rotation
and
its
orbital
flight
and
its
ability
to
apply
gravitational
force
to
other
celestial
bodies
wandl
was
controlling
her
own
movements
by
applying
gravity
force
attraction
and
repulsion
to
all
the
celestial
starfield
and
doubtless
also
by
applying
the
repulsive
beam
tangentially
against
the
ether
like
rocket
streams
in
this
respect
i
realized
the
planet
was
probably
operated
not
unlike
one
of
our
familiar
spaceships
in
effect
it
was
itself
a
gigantic
globular
vehicle
later
i
learned
that
it
was
thought
that
wandl
atmosphere
could
be
highly
electronized
at
will
with
a
resulting
aberration
of
the
natural
reflected
from
her
into
space
this
could
have
caused
the
blurring
of
the
image
of
wandl
when
viewed
telescopically
from
other
worlds
again
for
a
moment
of
the
contact
there
was
that
bursting
light
in
the
sky
the
contact
with
the
venus
beam
lasted
a
minute
or
two
snap
and
i
on
the
cauldron
rim
were
engulfed
in
the
blaze
of
reflected
light
and
the
wild
scream
of
sound
then
presently
the
turmoil
subsided
the
contact
in
the
sky
was
broken
the
of
venus
jerked
itself
away
but
on
the
next
venus
rotation
it
would
be
attacked
again
another
few
minutes
passed
the
little
circular
depression
beneath
us
was
dim
and
silent
as
we
had
first
seen
it
figures
were
moving
within
the
dwelling
structure
from
several
of
the
underground
entrances
figures
came
up
the
shapes
of
workers
three
or
four
of
the
brains
came
bouncing
up
moving
along
the
ground
catwalk
with
little
leaps
all
the
figures
entered
the
distant
main
dwelling
house
the
contact
was
over
probably
hardly
anyone
left
down
below
snap
whispered
now
our
chance
if
we
can
get
into
that
opening
without
being
seen
i
said
shadows
down
the
rocks
to
the
left
damnation
gregg
we
can
make
it
in
one
calculated
leap
i
try
it
first
i
get
in
and
wait
for
you
right
we
each
had
a
gravity
cylinder
at
our
belt
and
a
in
our
hand
the
slope
of
the
depression
was
dim
here
merely
starlit
it
was
a
steep
broken
and
fairly
shadowed
descent
fifty
feet
to
the
little
kiosk
which
marked
the
nearest
subterranean
entrance
i
went
down
it
with
a
swoop
landed
in
a
heap
beside
the
kiosk
and
ducked
into
it
instinct
made
me
fear
a
guard
but
reason
told
me
none
would
be
here
there
was
only
the
danger
of
encountering
someone
coming
up
i
was
at
the
top
of
a
winding
descending
passage
a
floor
there
were
occasional
lights
in
the
ceiling
in
a
moment
snap
joined
me
got
here
i
wonder
how
far
down
it
goes
i
gripped
him
snap
no
matter
what
happens
do
it
with
a
rush
keep
with
me
and
if
i
shout
to
get
out
we
go
out
with
a
rush
yes
back
to
the
girls
use
your
and
the
gravity
projector
in
getting
back
to
them
and
get
away
without
me
if
i
fall
same
for
you
gregg
we
went
down
the
deserted
passage
we
had
had
experience
in
movement
on
wandl
now
we
handled
ourselves
more
deftly
we
went
down
several
hundred
feet
the
passage
branched
but
there
always
seemed
a
main
tunnel
it
was
all
deserted
there
were
distant
silent
rooms
were
these
factories
of
the
strange
forms
of
electronic
gravity
currents
wandl
used
some
were
in
operation
a
hum
issued
from
them
workers
moved
about
we
stopped
to
consult
the
girls
and
molo
himself
had
described
what
we
would
find
a
main
route
leading
to
the
control
room
where
the
delicate
mechanisms
which
operated
all
this
were
centralized
the
nerve
center
of
wandl
it
seemed
that
we
were
following
that
main
route
a
worker
came
with
a
swimming
leap
past
us
we
dropped
into
a
hollowed
shadow
at
a
tunnel
intersection
and
he
went
swooping
by
lord
snap
i
muttered
that
was
too
close
for
comfort
again
we
advanced
the
tunnel
turned
sharply
down
a
short
slope
a
glowing
room
was
disclosed
with
two
or
three
workmen
moving
within
it
the
main
control
room
we
could
not
doubt
it
molo
in
his
enthusiasm
had
once
described
it
clearly
to
the
girls
its
great
skeins
of
little
wires
spread
upon
the
walls
the
myriad
tiny
opalescent
discs
contacted
with
the
small
gray
rock
surface
under
the
tangled
masses
of
the
levers
and
dials
banked
on
the
circular
tables
they
were
unmistakable
features
there
it
is
snap
i
whispered
in
his
ear
in
that
central
rack
those
insulated
rods
see
them
anita
told
us
they
used
them
to
adjust
the
discs
watch
out
for
the
current
but
it
off
now
gregg
there
still
danger
in
it
and
you
somewhere
keep
your
hands
off
use
the
rods
the
operators
he
got
no
further
a
figure
lunged
into
us
from
behind
a
giant
worker
his
largest
pincer
bit
into
my
shoulder
his
hollow
shout
resounded
the
operators
of
the
control
room
came
with
leaps
at
us
there
was
a
moment
of
wild
confusion
light
seemingly
almost
weightless
bodies
flapped
against
us
arms
gripped
us
but
they
were
flimsy
the
huge
cracked
gruesomely
as
we
struck
with
our
solid
fists
a
moment
of
turmoil
passed
no
bolts
were
fired
the
shouts
were
brief
down
here
in
the
narrow
confines
of
the
tunnel
panting
bruised
more
by
our
collisions
against
the
rocks
than
by
our
adversaries
we
ceased
our
wild
lunges
we
did
not
look
at
the
scattered
broken
and
crushed
bodies
drifting
now
to
the
floor
now
snap
hurry
others
may
come
we
lunged
into
the
glowing
control
room
seized
the
long
insulated
poles
from
the
central
rack
they
had
a
grateful
feel
of
weight
i
picked
one
up
jumped
with
a
twenty
foot
leap
to
the
wall
the
wires
came
down
like
cobwebs
under
my
sweeping
blows
the
little
discs
knocked
off
as
though
they
were
fungus
growth
sparks
flew
around
us
shafts
of
electronic
radiance
spat
out
the
wall
was
hissing
over
all
its
length
as
i
ranged
up
and
down
it
the
tangled
broken
threads
of
wire
writhed
like
living
things
on
the
floor
then
crumpled
fused
and
turned
black
i
swept
that
with
frantic
haste
lunged
around
and
started
another
way
across
the
room
i
saw
snap
doing
the
same
a
turmoil
of
electrical
sound
was
reverberating
around
us
deafening
and
the
glare
was
blinding
a
shot
from
the
wreckage
under
my
rod
it
seared
my
left
arm
my
sleeve
burned
off
the
arm
hung
limp
and
tingling
at
my
side
i
stopped
to
rub
it
in
a
moment
strength
came
back
to
its
muscles
snap
was
raging
like
a
great
heavy
bird
gone
amok
through
the
green
fumes
of
electrical
gases
which
were
filling
the
room
i
saw
him
lunging
at
the
circular
tables
overturning
them
they
cracked
like
thin
polished
stone
as
they
struck
the
metal
floor
i
finished
with
the
wall
there
was
a
square
piece
of
metal
apparatus
ramified
and
intricate
i
heaved
it
over
upon
its
side
a
thousand
little
mirrors
and
prisms
dislodged
from
it
came
out
in
a
splintering
deluge
i
was
aware
of
snap
fighting
with
a
figure
then
he
was
free
of
it
i
saw
it
mashed
and
broken
at
his
feet
as
i
dove
past
swimming
in
the
smoke
to
lunge
the
length
of
a
great
fluorescent
tube
which
was
still
dimly
glowing
my
pole
pried
it
over
it
crashed
with
a
brief
puff
of
light
and
the
rush
of
an
explosion
as
air
went
into
its
vacuum
i
found
snap
panting
beside
me
clinging
to
me
in
the
glare
was
dying
around
us
the
din
was
lessening
we
were
choking
in
the
chemical
fumes
of
the
released
gases
turgid
darkness
was
coming
to
the
wrecked
room
with
little
hissing
flares
spitting
through
it
enough
gregg
listen
up
overhead
a
great
siren
from
up
there
was
screaming
into
the
night
snap
panted
got
to
get
out
of
here
ca
breathe
together
we
lunged
for
the
tunnel
by
which
we
had
entered
i
stood
a
moment
gazing
back
upon
the
strewn
and
scattered
room
the
delicate
of
wandl
heavy
gas
fumes
swirled
in
it
darkness
and
silence
closed
down
over
us
was
turmoil
that
screaming
siren
then
suddenly
it
was
checked
and
we
heard
the
thump
and
swish
of
what
on
earth
would
have
been
called
running
footsteps
and
shouts
snap
shoved
me
do
stay
there
you
fool
we
lunged
up
the
passage
figures
barred
it
but
they
scattered
a
bolt
hissed
at
us
but
missed
at
the
kiosk
a
group
of
workers
and
several
peering
little
brains
leaped
away
in
terror
to
let
us
pass
we
gained
the
open
air
with
the
small
gravity
rays
darting
down
with
repulsion
upon
the
rocks
we
mounted
like
rockets
out
of
the
cauldron
the
upper
plateau
lay
silent
in
the
starlight
but
the
cauldron
behind
us
was
ringing
with
alarm
and
again
the
danger
siren
was
blaring
i
changed
my
way
of
direction
swung
it
to
the
plateau
rocks
ahead
the
arc
of
my
flight
was
sharply
bent
as
i
went
hurtling
down
over
me
i
saw
snap
use
the
same
tactics
i
tried
to
aim
for
where
we
had
left
the
girls
and
molo
i
could
not
see
them
down
there
amid
the
starlit
crags
and
suddenly
a
wild
apprehension
filled
me
how
had
we
dared
leave
them
to
molo
trickery
then
ahead
and
below
me
i
saw
the
slight
figure
of
one
of
the
girls
standing
on
a
rock
with
arms
outstretched
to
signal
us
i
changed
my
ray
to
repulsion
barely
in
time
to
avoid
crashing
the
landing
flung
me
in
a
heap
twenty
feet
away
snap
came
whirling
down
we
picked
ourselves
up
saw
anita
waving
from
the
rock
and
bounded
to
her
the
girls
were
safe
venza
sat
intent
with
unwavering
watchful
gaze
across
the
intervening
space
to
where
molo
had
flattened
himself
against
his
rock
not
daring
to
move
still
got
him
venza
exulted
he
was
willing
to
take
any
chances
with
us
you
did
it
snap
i
a
if
we
did
come
on
got
to
get
out
of
this
they
after
us
we
wrecked
the
whole
damn
place
venza
wandl
a
normal
planet
now
no
more
of
this
accursed
dislocation
of
earth
we
learned
later
that
our
hope
and
our
assumption
that
we
had
irretrievably
wrecked
the
entire
gravity
control
system
of
wandl
was
proven
to
be
a
fact
wandl
was
in
effect
a
normal
celestial
body
now
the
beams
planted
in
greater
new
york
and
grebhar
still
streamed
across
space
but
there
was
no
giant
beam
from
wandl
to
seize
them
and
wandl
now
could
not
move
through
space
of
her
own
volition
like
earth
and
all
other
known
planets
satellites
comets
and
asteroids
she
was
subject
now
to
all
the
normal
natural
laws
of
celestial
mechanics
we
had
done
a
thorough
job
of
it
now
i
shoved
at
snap
no
time
to
talk
you
tow
the
girls
i
take
molo
got
to
get
to
the
i
lunged
over
and
seized
molo
we
did
it
now
for
your
vessel
it
will
be
ill
for
you
if
she
is
not
where
you
say
she
is
she
will
be
there
gregg
haljan
he
docilely
put
himself
in
position
for
me
to
hook
my
forearm
under
his
crossed
bound
wrists
and
carry
him
snap
rose
up
past
us
towing
the
girls
over
the
nearby
cauldron
a
figure
mounted
to
gaze
and
see
the
nature
of
this
strange
attacking
enemy
and
then
sank
back
with
molo
hanging
to
me
i
mounted
with
my
ray
following
snap
and
the
girls
into
the
starlight
with
the
turmoil
of
the
cauldron
receding
until
in
a
moment
or
so
it
was
gone
behind
our
horizon
we
headed
now
not
toward
wor
whence
we
had
come
but
over
at
an
angle
to
the
side
our
great
bounding
arcs
soon
left
the
mountains
behind
we
crossed
the
river
another
portion
of
the
forest
and
came
over
undulating
lowlands
it
was
a
flight
of
under
half
an
hour
the
pursuit
if
indeed
anyone
followed
us
remained
below
our
little
segment
of
curving
horizon
everywhere
there
was
evidence
of
the
storm
the
forest
trees
were
laid
flat
strewn
like
driftwood
over
the
area
the
river
had
in
several
places
lashed
over
its
banks
the
lowlands
were
dotted
thick
with
some
were
hanging
awry
on
their
stems
others
were
pulled
from
their
place
cracked
and
piled
into
a
litter
we
kept
well
aloft
the
surface
scenes
were
only
glimpses
of
wreckage
moving
lights
and
people
and
there
were
areas
which
the
wind
had
seemingly
spared
the
confusion
from
the
storm
was
mingled
now
with
the
spreading
alarm
from
the
gravity
station
the
sound
of
the
danger
siren
there
was
still
audible
behind
us
as
we
advanced
into
what
now
seemed
the
outskirts
of
a
city
like
wor
with
a
pile
of
metal
structures
ranging
the
horizon
ahead
i
saw
a
distant
spaceship
rise
up
and
wing
away
wandl
was
proceeding
with
the
dispatching
of
her
space
navy
to
oppose
the
distantly
gathering
ships
of
earth
venus
and
mars
no
doubt
with
the
wrecking
of
the
control
station
the
masters
of
wandl
immediately
recognized
the
paramount
importance
of
the
coming
battle
the
huge
globular
ship
sailed
high
over
us
rotating
with
the
impulse
of
its
in
a
moment
it
was
lost
in
the
stars
and
then
another
rose
and
followed
it
there
were
many
human
figures
in
the
air
around
us
now
i
mounted
higher
and
snap
with
the
girls
followed
me
the
figures
intent
upon
their
own
affairs
did
not
seem
to
heed
us
molo
vessel
lay
alone
upon
a
low
metal
cradle
no
other
ship
was
near
it
but
half
a
mile
away
on
both
sides
we
could
see
others
resting
on
their
stages
lights
were
moving
around
and
upon
them
but
the
was
dark
and
neglected
we
poised
a
thousand
feet
over
her
and
to
one
side
i
saw
her
as
a
long
low
pointed
vessel
dead
gray
in
color
longer
than
the
and
seemingly
narrower
but
very
similar
in
aspect
meka
and
i
are
supposed
to
be
gathering
our
crew
said
molo
no
one
bothers
with
my
vessel
will
you
take
me
to
wor
now
to
get
meka
i
will
not
snap
was
drifting
down
with
the
girls
they
were
near
us
his
arm
waved
at
me
with
a
gesture
and
then
came
the
muffled
tone
of
his
voice
shall
we
drop
down
gregg
yes
but
cautiously
have
your
gun
ready
molo
protested
i
would
like
to
take
meka
with
us
and
a
few
of
my
crew
you
will
have
trouble
handling
the
just
us
three
men
we
take
our
chances
we
dropped
swiftly
down
upon
the
dark
and
vacant
platform
the
gray
hull
of
the
loomed
beside
us
her
dome
arched
still
higher
an
inclined
catwalk
went
up
to
her
opened
i
go
first
i
said
softly
to
snap
come
quickly
after
me
watch
out
there
might
be
someone
on
board
venza
still
clung
to
her
weapon
mine
was
in
my
hand
as
i
lifted
molo
and
ignoring
the
incline
bounded
the
thirty
feet
for
the
i
landed
safely
and
stood
molo
upon
his
feet
do
you
move
i
admonished
him
sternly
he
stood
docilely
against
the
cabin
wall
of
the
superstructure
no
one
here
we
had
thought
there
might
easily
be
one
or
two
workers
on
board
snap
and
the
girls
came
sailing
one
after
the
other
and
landed
on
the
deck
beside
me
we
stood
silent
alert
no
one
appeared
from
within
the
cabin
or
from
the
lengths
of
the
deck
venza
was
watching
molo
with
her
weapon
upon
him
snap
and
i
had
planned
this
boarding
anita
and
venza
to
stay
here
and
guard
molo
while
we
searched
the
ship
and
inspected
the
controls
we
started
for
the
cabin
door
oval
gregg
it
was
all
the
warning
snap
could
give
i
was
within
the
dim
cabin
but
he
behind
me
was
still
on
the
deck
i
whirled
to
see
a
dozen
dark
forms
leaping
from
the
roof
of
the
cabin
superstructure
snap
was
all
but
buried
by
them
these
were
not
men
of
wandl
but
molo
pirate
crew
martians
earthmen
and
venusians
snap
spat
as
he
went
down
one
of
the
men
dropped
away
i
saw
venza
turn
with
startled
horror
as
the
huge
figure
of
meka
leaped
down
upon
her
and
anita
from
the
roof
for
an
instant
weapon
in
hand
i
paused
in
the
doorway
i
could
not
fire
into
the
turmoil
of
that
struggling
group
so
instead
plunged
into
it
striking
with
my
fists
molo
was
shouting
do
not
kill
them
i
was
ordered
not
to
kill
them
these
men
so
different
from
the
workers
and
the
brains
of
wandl
were
solid
in
my
grip
but
we
were
all
so
weightless
i
felled
one
but
others
gripped
me
pounded
me
a
struggling
mass
of
bodies
arms
and
legs
we
surged
up
to
the
superstructure
roof
and
dropped
upon
it
my
weapon
was
gone
half
a
dozen
adversaries
had
me
pinioned
down
on
the
deck
i
saw
that
venza
had
lost
her
weapon
molo
and
meka
were
clutching
her
snap
was
fighting
with
several
antagonists
anita
was
loose
she
dove
for
the
group
in
which
snap
was
struggling
hit
them
kicked
and
bounded
upward
to
be
seized
by
two
of
my
own
captors
anita
do
fight
they
kill
you
i
tried
to
break
loose
but
four
huge
martians
were
holding
me
oh
gregg
there
was
horror
in
anita
voice
snap
had
broken
away
at
the
open
he
stood
as
though
undecided
what
to
do
the
deck
was
almost
black
around
him
he
was
silhouetted
against
the
outside
starlight
from
almost
at
his
side
in
the
darkness
a
tiny
bolt
spat
upward
at
his
head
his
arms
went
wildly
out
he
tumbled
backward
at
the
top
of
the
boarding
incline
his
body
seemed
spasmodically
to
kick
and
the
thrust
whirled
it
down
into
the
darkness
the
end
of
snap
a
pang
went
through
me
snap
my
best
friend
molo
cursed
the
unknown
man
of
his
crew
who
had
fired
the
shot
but
none
would
admit
who
did
it
get
to
your
posts
molo
roared
in
martian
enough
of
you
are
here
lash
up
the
prisoners
we
launching
away
now
he
thumped
his
brawny
sister
as
she
passed
him
well
played
meka
these
wily
martians
molo
had
planned
that
meka
was
to
gather
the
crew
and
wait
here
at
the
ship
for
him
and
wyk
if
they
returned
with
us
as
captives
it
would
be
here
that
they
would
come
but
if
by
chance
things
went
adversely
molo
reasoned
we
would
act
just
as
we
did
and
meka
and
her
men
were
lurking
here
in
ambush
waiting
for
us
all
the
many
various
ports
swung
shut
anita
venza
and
i
with
arms
and
legs
bound
were
taken
by
molo
to
the
forward
observation
and
control
room
the
ship
was
resounding
with
signals
the
interior
controls
in
the
raised
the
within
the
vessel
to
a
strength
comparable
to
that
of
earth
within
a
few
minutes
the
lifted
from
the
stage
strange
weird
wandl
fell
away
from
us
we
slid
upward
through
the
atmosphere
following
one
of
the
globular
wandl
vessels
and
headed
into
space
toward
the
point
where
a
few
million
miles
distant
the
ships
of
allied
earth
venus
and
mars
were
gathering
they
are
visible
molo
turned
from
the
eyepiece
of
his
do
you
want
to
see
them
gregg
haljan
we
were
in
the
forward
control
and
observation
turret
of
the
molo
and
his
sister
meka
venza
anita
and
myself
unobtrusively
squatting
on
the
floor
was
a
small
gray
fellow
put
there
weapon
in
hand
to
watch
us
he
was
a
ruffian
from
the
underworld
of
grebhar
a
member
of
the
pirate
crew
we
were
some
ten
hours
out
from
wandl
a
group
of
four
of
the
globular
wandl
ships
were
with
us
strung
in
a
line
some
ten
thousand
miles
to
our
left
we
had
been
heading
diagonally
toward
mars
some
fifteen
other
wandl
vessels
were
ahead
and
others
following
we
were
no
more
than
fifteen
million
miles
from
mars
when
molo
sighted
the
allied
ships
will
you
observe
them
gregg
haljan
i
moved
to
take
his
place
at
the
with
the
gaze
of
anita
and
venza
upon
me
they
sat
huddled
together
on
a
low
bench
against
the
back
curve
of
the
circular
turret
it
was
dim
here
with
little
spots
of
instrument
lights
and
the
radiance
coming
in
the
glassite
plates
of
the
encircling
dome
the
loss
of
snap
had
put
a
grim
look
upon
the
girls
they
were
dispirited
docile
with
meka
they
had
hardly
had
a
word
with
me
i
think
that
all
of
us
had
about
given
up
hope
during
those
hours
molo
had
consulted
me
several
times
with
his
policies
of
navigation
but
i
saw
no
chance
to
trick
him
he
was
indeed
far
more
experienced
than
i
and
more
skillful
in
celestial
mechanics
i
worked
with
him
i
learned
the
operation
and
the
handling
of
the
which
was
not
greatly
different
from
the
or
the
poor
snap
he
and
i
had
planned
to
capture
and
navigate
this
we
could
have
handled
her
there
were
i
gathered
some
fifteen
men
aboard
her
now
but
no
more
than
two
or
three
were
engaged
at
the
navigating
mechanisms
even
they
could
be
dispensed
with
at
times
for
the
ship
controls
were
all
automatic
handled
directly
from
the
forward
turret
i
learned
too
something
though
not
much
of
the
weapons
they
were
similar
to
those
of
the
allied
ships
since
molo
in
equipping
his
pirate
craft
had
seized
upon
all
the
best
he
could
find
of
the
three
worlds
the
during
this
flight
toward
mars
was
in
close
communication
with
the
wandl
craft
there
was
a
giant
vessel
the
wor
off
to
our
left
now
it
carried
the
brain
master
in
command
of
the
wandl
forces
molo
took
his
orders
from
the
wor
but
since
his
equipment
and
his
weapons
were
so
wholly
different
the
was
set
apart
i
can
do
what
i
like
molo
told
me
with
my
own
judgement
i
can
act
you
shall
see
you
had
plenty
of
experience
molo
have
i
not
the
terror
of
the
starways
your
world
called
me
he
chuckled
vaingloriously
i
must
justify
it
now
act
do
not
talk
meka
commented
sourly
children
with
toys
make
speeches
like
that
and
then
the
toys
get
broken
fear
not
sister
never
again
will
the
come
to
grief
and
now
i
gazed
through
the
at
the
waiting
allied
ships
they
were
lying
some
eight
million
miles
off
mars
i
gazed
and
saw
the
poised
little
group
there
were
perhaps
fifty
of
them
the
majority
were
martian
long
low
and
very
and
dull
red
in
color
the
wider
earth
and
venus
ships
were
silvery
and
drab
i
could
distinguish
the
several
different
types
of
craft
in
this
hastily
assembled
fleet
many
converted
commercials
like
my
a
few
rakish
police
ships
and
about
a
dozen
of
the
long
narrow
supermodern
warships
it
was
their
first
voyage
into
battle
they
had
only
been
built
these
past
few
years
by
peaceful
governments
that
protested
there
never
again
would
be
another
war
the
little
fleet
was
lying
waiting
for
us
it
was
being
augmented
by
occasional
other
ships
from
mars
they
saw
us
coming
now
the
radiance
of
a
benson
enveloped
them
with
a
shaft
toward
us
the
image
of
them
shifted
over
a
million
miles
to
one
side
molo
laughed
when
he
saw
it
protecting
themselves
already
but
we
are
not
going
to
attack
them
there
the
first
tactics
of
the
wandl
commanders
surprised
me
we
swung
away
from
the
course
to
mars
and
headed
diagonally
toward
earth
and
venus
earth
was
the
nearer
to
us
with
venus
some
forty
million
miles
beyond
her
for
hours
we
turned
in
that
sweeping
curve
then
with
our
wandl
convoy
following
we
headed
for
earth
i
could
not
help
admiring
the
way
the
was
handled
she
turned
more
sharply
than
the
wandl
craft
and
before
our
next
meal
we
were
leading
them
all
would
the
allied
ships
follow
us
it
was
immediately
apparent
they
were
coming
but
from
their
poised
position
hours
of
attaining
velocity
would
be
needed
the
other
allied
vessels
approaching
from
venus
and
earth
checked
their
flight
and
turned
after
us
we
passed
within
five
or
six
hundred
thousand
miles
of
several
of
them
i
found
now
that
some
twenty
other
wandl
ships
leaving
wandl
after
us
had
headed
directly
for
earth
we
were
all
together
presently
the
and
nearly
fifty
wandl
ships
gathered
close
to
one
side
of
the
moon
the
allies
about
a
hundred
of
them
were
strung
through
space
scattered
with
varying
velocities
and
flight
direction
but
most
of
them
endeavoring
to
get
between
the
moon
and
earth
this
was
the
day
i
call
it
that
a
routine
of
meals
which
meka
grimly
served
us
in
the
turret
and
a
little
sleep
when
she
took
the
girls
below
and
i
lay
on
the
turret
floor
i
wondered
who
was
in
command
of
this
allied
force
and
did
not
learn
until
afterward
that
it
was
grantline
the
had
fallen
upon
the
moon
apennines
not
very
far
from
where
my
old
still
lay
near
the
base
of
archimedes
but
grantline
and
a
few
of
his
companions
with
their
powered
suits
had
struggled
free
from
the
gravity
pull
of
the
wreckage
and
a
few
hours
later
a
ship
out
from
earth
picked
them
up
grantline
on
one
of
the
earth
police
ships
commanded
the
fleet
now
and
he
afterward
told
me
in
detail
how
he
endeavored
to
conduct
his
forces
in
the
battle
thus
enabling
me
to
describe
it
from
both
viewpoints
he
had
been
cruising
toward
mars
when
he
saw
us
make
the
turn
he
thought
a
landing
upon
earth
might
be
planned
and
hastened
all
his
ships
into
the
area
between
the
moon
and
earth
to
cut
us
off
but
that
was
what
wandl
wanted
the
wandl
ships
with
the
among
them
made
a
complete
slow
circuit
of
the
moon
it
took
another
day
molo
said
very
little
to
me
in
explanation
of
the
wandl
tactics
but
i
could
see
that
the
object
was
to
lure
grantline
into
following
a
few
of
the
allied
ships
did
follow
us
around
but
not
many
the
rest
stayed
carefully
guarding
the
line
between
the
moon
and
earth
there
had
been
no
encounter
yet
between
the
hostile
ships
the
huge
distances
involved
in
the
engagement
must
be
kept
in
mind
the
gravity
rays
from
the
wandl
ships
were
only
a
slight
disturbing
element
at
such
a
long
distance
grantline
and
benson
were
defensive
only
for
offence
grantline
electronic
guns
and
other
weapons
were
of
varying
range
but
none
for
such
distances
as
these
wandl
seemed
unwilling
to
begin
the
battle
and
grantline
was
cautious
as
well
he
did
not
know
what
weapons
these
strange
globular
vessels
would
use
his
only
experience
had
been
our
encounter
with
the
whirling
discs
then
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
came
the
first
clash
the
and
all
the
wandl
ships
were
again
clustered
on
the
earth
side
of
the
moon
they
were
hovering
perhaps
twenty
thousand
miles
above
its
surface
grantline
force
was
a
hundred
thousand
miles
off
toward
earth
one
of
the
wandl
ships
came
tentatively
forward
and
grantline
sent
one
of
the
warships
to
meet
it
they
encircled
each
other
both
were
cautious
but
there
was
a
passing
within
fifty
miles
the
earth
ship
fired
her
bolts
the
insulated
barrage
of
the
wandl
ship
withstood
them
there
was
a
shower
of
ether
sparks
close
to
the
ship
and
a
reddening
of
the
hull
but
nothing
more
it
seemed
that
the
of
the
wandl
and
allied
ships
were
very
similar
in
nature
an
aura
of
enclosing
the
ship
like
a
curtain
fifty
feet
away
absorbed
the
electronic
stream
of
the
enemy
bolt
the
wandl
ship
flung
no
bolts
she
loosed
a
score
of
the
whirling
discs
during
the
passing
they
were
of
varying
sizes
but
similar
to
those
which
cut
and
wrecked
the
in
this
instance
the
grantline
ship
was
able
to
destroy
each
of
them
as
it
came
close
this
was
the
first
encounter
the
earth
warship
went
back
to
its
squadron
and
the
wandl
vessel
rejoined
its
fellows
it
had
fired
no
bolts
grantline
suspected
now
what
afterward
proved
to
be
the
fact
these
wandl
vessels
were
not
equipped
with
electronic
guns
the
wandl
defensive
tactics
were
necessary
they
feared
a
widespread
encounter
they
were
hovering
in
a
compact
group
covering
a
five
hundred
mile
area
over
the
moon
surface
their
purpose
was
not
yet
apparent
but
grantline
saw
now
that
one
of
the
wandl
ships
was
dropping
down
and
landing
on
the
moon
it
skimmed
the
apennines
and
landed
not
far
from
archimedes
what
was
that
for
grantline
noticed
that
the
lowering
wandl
fleet
tried
to
mask
the
landing
and
their
with
repulsive
force
darted
out
to
impede
the
grantline
vessels
should
they
try
to
advance
this
earthward
hemisphere
of
the
moon
was
now
largely
in
shadow
but
grantline
magnifiers
showed
the
vessel
on
the
moon
apparatus
was
being
unloaded
it
seemed
down
there
on
the
rocky
moon
plain
in
the
foothills
of
the
apennines
that
some
extensive
elaborate
base
was
being
prepared
it
was
for
this
the
hovering
wandl
fleet
was
waiting
holding
off
from
conflict
until
this
moon
base
was
ready
when
grantline
reached
that
conclusion
he
ordered
all
his
vessels
forward
to
a
general
attack
during
this
time
on
the
as
we
and
the
wandl
fleet
made
that
preliminary
circuit
of
the
moon
an
incident
occurred
which
changed
everything
for
me
i
had
noticed
several
times
as
we
gathered
in
the
forward
turret
that
venza
and
anita
were
eying
me
their
expressions
were
furtive
but
i
realized
that
they
were
trying
to
attract
my
attention
we
had
no
opportunity
to
speak
secretly
molo
or
meka
or
that
guard
were
always
too
near
us
and
molo
kept
me
busy
with
computations
of
our
course
we
rounded
the
moon
we
gathered
with
the
wandl
fleet
some
twenty
thousand
miles
above
the
lunar
surface
and
i
watched
that
ship
descend
and
land
like
grantline
i
wondered
what
for
molo
gave
me
no
hint
i
saw
through
his
bloated
figures
in
pressure
suits
unloading
mechanisms
they
seemed
to
be
placing
huge
in
a
circle
on
the
lunar
rocks
it
was
reminiscent
of
the
wandl
gravity
station
and
the
which
molo
had
planted
in
york
then
at
last
the
girls
had
an
opportunity
to
whisper
to
me
a
swift
phrase
came
from
anita
gregg
snap
is
alive
hiding
on
board
i
gasped
snap
alive
planning
to
rescue
us
you
and
he
can
capture
the
anita
tell
me
how
no
more
now
our
room
below
he
near
it
he
spoke
to
us
no
more
she
moved
away
from
me
but
it
was
enough
snap
alive
i
recalled
that
when
he
fell
beside
the
ship
no
one
had
bothered
to
go
down
after
the
body
and
at
that
time
the
were
open
after
a
time
meka
took
the
girls
below
i
sat
with
molo
gazing
down
at
the
dark
and
gloomy
surface
of
the
moon
i
had
finished
the
mathematical
work
molo
had
given
me
my
thoughts
were
with
anita
and
venza
down
in
their
cabin
now
with
meka
perhaps
even
now
snap
was
joining
them
i
hardly
heard
molo
low
muttered
curses
as
he
set
his
lenses
for
a
slight
alteration
of
our
slow
circular
course
among
the
wandl
fleet
that
fellow
at
my
acts
like
a
nitwit
he
has
them
disarranged
it
snapped
me
to
sudden
alertness
something
wrong
molo
nonsense
these
men
of
my
crew
answer
my
controls
too
slowly
they
should
jump
when
my
signals
come
the
plates
suddenly
shifted
normally
but
there
had
been
an
interval
of
delay
molo
was
puzzled
and
annoyed
my
heart
pounded
as
i
wondered
if
he
would
investigate
but
he
did
not
you
had
better
sleep
haljan
take
advantage
now
we
shall
have
action
presently
did
you
figure
our
emerging
curve
i
shoved
my
computations
across
the
table
to
him
there
you
are
quick
haljan
we
should
emerge
from
the
moon
shadow
in
about
two
hours
but
i
will
not
hold
that
course
we
staying
close
near
here
with
the
other
vessels
but
i
want
some
velocity
always
take
your
sleep
haljan
i
stretched
on
the
narrow
floor
mattress
the
turret
was
silent
i
was
aroused
from
a
doze
by
molo
activities
in
the
turret
the
girls
and
meka
were
still
below
the
venusian
squatting
in
the
turret
corner
still
had
his
gun
upon
me
i
saw
that
grantline
ships
over
a
wide
spread
were
advancing
and
presently
we
were
engaged
in
the
soundless
turmoil
of
battle
i
can
not
relate
more
than
fragments
things
i
saw
and
experienced
during
six
or
more
hours
of
bursting
electronic
light
and
puffs
of
darkness
in
that
spread
of
battle
area
within
the
it
was
a
silent
battle
of
crossing
lights
ships
a
thousand
miles
apart
gathering
velocity
with
great
tangential
curves
passing
each
other
in
a
second
sweeping
a
thousand
miles
apart
again
turning
and
coming
back
a
hundred
engagements
the
was
very
fast
very
mobile
and
unlike
all
the
other
wandl
ships
had
the
allies
own
weapons
to
use
against
them
i
saw
now
why
they
called
molo
the
terror
of
the
starways
we
swept
into
the
shadowed
battle
area
over
all
its
spread
were
the
radiant
wandl
disturbing
and
impeding
the
course
of
grantline
ships
there
was
the
luminous
gleam
of
projectile
rockets
like
little
comets
soundless
launched
by
the
wandl
craft
and
the
radiance
of
the
which
all
the
vessels
were
using
now
for
close
maneuvering
the
glare
of
searchlight
bombs
and
his
white
to
disclose
the
deadly
whirling
discs
which
the
weapons
of
his
vessel
must
seek
out
and
destroy
a
chaos
of
silent
light
stabbed
here
and
there
with
grantline
darkness
bombs
bombs
of
limited
local
range
which
exploded
in
space
and
which
for
a
few
minutes
duration
absorbed
all
giving
a
temporary
effect
of
darkness
and
then
wreckage
broken
leprous
wandl
vessels
whose
barrage
at
close
range
had
been
smashed
by
grantline
guns
torn
and
littered
allied
ships
struck
by
the
huge
exploding
and
the
whirling
discs
airless
hulks
and
scattered
fragments
which
no
longer
resembled
a
ship
at
all
but
only
a
hull
plate
or
a
torn
segment
of
dome
and
little
drifting
blobs
the
survivors
in
pressure
suits
who
had
leaped
from
the
wreckage
little
blobs
ignored
whirled
away
or
drawn
forward
as
by
chance
the
sweeping
fell
upon
them
tiny
derelicts
floating
stormtossed
until
the
moon
attraction
caught
and
pulled
them
down
or
a
whirling
disc
cut
through
them
or
the
distant
aura
of
a
bolt
shocked
them
to
a
merciful
death
it
was
a
spread
of
fantasy
infernal
out
of
it
after
an
hour
or
two
a
steady
sift
of
every
manner
of
wreckage
was
drifting
down
upon
the
moon
the
scene
began
to
blur
a
haze
like
glowing
or
the
radiance
from
a
comet
tail
was
spreading
a
weirdly
luminous
mist
blurring
obscuring
the
scene
this
was
the
released
electrons
and
the
dissipating
gases
of
the
space
guns
and
exploding
projectiles
forming
dust
which
glowed
in
the
mingled
starlight
and
earthlight
the
had
plunged
during
those
six
or
eight
hours
through
the
battle
area
our
several
encounters
were
all
characterized
by
the
extreme
flexibility
her
speed
mobility
and
molo
reckless
skill
we
came
through
unscathed
there
is
a
certain
advantage
for
the
man
who
seems
not
to
care
for
his
own
life
but
there
was
an
encounter
the
last
one
as
it
chanced
just
before
we
emerged
downward
out
of
the
fog
and
found
ourselves
no
more
than
a
thousand
miles
above
the
moon
surface
where
our
adversary
was
equally
reckless
and
only
molo
skill
saved
us
we
came
upon
a
venus
police
ship
we
plunged
as
though
seeking
a
collision
and
the
venus
ship
was
willing
for
a
moment
of
chaos
both
barrages
held
against
the
exchange
of
bolts
then
we
rolled
over
and
tilted
down
from
the
impulse
of
the
stern
rockets
the
passing
must
have
been
within
feet
not
miles
and
in
that
second
molo
timed
a
shot
to
strike
at
the
enemy
bottom
it
went
through
their
barrage
behind
us
a
second
later
there
was
only
strewn
wreckage
of
the
ship
so
finely
powdered
that
it
became
a
silvery
radiance
like
moonlight
shining
on
a
little
patch
of
fog
not
too
bad
molo
gazed
around
for
appreciation
not
bad
gregg
haljan
molo
is
not
too
unskillful
we
hung
now
close
above
the
moon
surface
with
the
battle
area
over
us
out
of
the
fog
up
there
came
the
drifting
wreckage
and
now
the
wandl
ships
were
coming
down
one
by
one
not
so
many
of
them
now
no
more
than
ten
of
them
emerged
grantline
did
not
follow
his
ships
withdrew
the
other
way
the
fog
gradually
dispersed
grantline
could
now
take
stock
of
the
battle
he
had
been
victorious
one
might
call
it
that
since
his
percentage
of
strength
numerically
was
greater
now
than
when
the
battle
began
ten
remaining
wandl
ships
and
the
allies
had
about
another
hour
passed
grantline
ships
were
gathered
in
a
close
group
ten
thousand
miles
above
the
moon
surface
under
them
the
ten
wandl
vessels
and
the
seemed
ranging
in
a
five
hundred
mile
circle
down
through
it
on
the
rocks
of
the
moon
in
the
foothills
of
the
apennines
the
mechanism
established
there
abruptly
sprang
into
action
it
was
a
giant
of
infinitely
greater
power
than
any
wandl
vessel
could
generate
it
flung
out
its
spreading
conical
ray
so
this
had
been
the
purpose
of
all
the
wandl
tactics
to
manipulate
grantline
into
his
present
position
this
though
far
smaller
was
comparable
to
the
one
used
by
the
wandl
control
station
a
rock
contact
against
a
huge
mass
wandl
and
here
the
moon
were
necessary
to
give
the
ray
its
power
no
ship
could
generate
such
a
ray
so
the
wandlites
chose
this
battleground
where
they
could
establish
themselves
upon
our
deserted
moon
the
beam
had
about
a
hundred
foot
diameter
at
its
base
on
the
rocks
it
passed
upward
through
the
circle
of
wandl
vessels
and
its
spread
bathed
all
of
grantline
ships
at
once
an
attractive
beam
so
powerful
that
the
ships
were
helpless
against
all
their
efforts
they
were
pinned
and
drawn
downward
a
slight
velocity
at
first
but
with
a
tremendous
acceleration
within
an
hour
they
were
hurtling
coming
together
as
they
speeded
down
the
narrowing
cone
of
the
beam
the
ten
thousand
miles
their
distance
above
the
moon
was
cut
to
five
thousand
the
wandl
ships
drew
aside
keeping
well
out
of
range
to
let
them
pass
in
another
thirty
minutes
they
would
crash
against
the
rocks
i
gazed
in
horror
from
the
turret
we
were
sidewise
to
the
angle
of
the
beam
grantline
ships
were
pulled
together
now
into
almost
a
group
they
hung
all
askew
helplessly
pinned
some
broadside
some
upended
the
movement
of
their
fall
was
so
rapid
that
even
with
the
naked
eye
it
was
apparent
got
them
now
molo
chuckled
this
is
the
end
for
them
gregg
haljan
there
were
only
three
of
us
in
the
turret
molo
and
i
and
my
watchful
silent
guard
who
sat
with
a
pointed
at
me
meka
and
the
two
girls
were
below
during
all
the
engagement
it
was
over
now
during
this
lull
molo
had
sent
the
men
from
the
deck
gun
ports
to
their
hull
quarters
our
decks
were
empty
now
the
bridges
and
catwalks
up
here
had
momentarily
no
occupants
the
had
little
velocity
only
a
slow
drift
downward
toward
the
moon
surface
which
now
was
only
a
few
hundred
miles
beneath
us
the
lunar
disc
was
a
great
dark
spread
of
desolation
with
only
the
sunlight
topping
the
distant
horizon
limb
and
from
under
us
to
the
side
was
the
source
of
the
giant
over
us
were
the
vessels
and
still
higher
the
helpless
knot
of
grantline
ships
hurtling
down
got
them
now
molo
repeated
in
another
he
never
finished
from
the
open
doorway
of
the
turret
a
figure
rose
up
snap
his
aspect
even
more
than
his
appearance
transfixed
me
snap
with
his
clothes
torn
grimy
and
spattered
with
blood
his
face
pale
and
gaunt
with
hollow
blazing
eyes
and
above
it
the
shock
of
rumpled
red
hair
in
one
hand
he
clutched
a
and
in
the
other
a
knife
my
guard
squatting
on
the
floor
snap
bolt
met
him
before
he
could
raise
his
weapon
he
tumbled
dead
almost
at
my
feet
and
mingled
with
the
hiss
of
the
bolt
was
snap
shout
at
the
unarmed
molo
into
the
corner
you
back
up
you
damned
traitor
else
i
kill
you
as
i
killed
everyone
else
on
this
ship
i
had
leaped
and
seized
the
gun
which
was
still
in
the
hand
of
the
dead
guard
snap
the
girls
down
below
free
they
got
meka
bound
and
gagged
locked
and
sealed
in
a
you
bring
them
up
i
hold
this
accursed
traitor
no
need
to
kill
him
by
the
gods
i
killed
enough
he
saw
for
the
first
time
the
vast
silent
drama
in
the
firmament
outside
the
dome
windows
gregg
for
the
love
of
no
time
now
snap
i
get
the
girls
watch
out
i
might
have
missed
somebody
down
below
he
had
three
men
appeared
on
the
forward
deck
near
the
foot
of
our
turret
ladder
my
bolt
spat
down
upon
them
two
of
them
fell
the
other
ran
aft
toward
where
i
saw
venza
and
anita
appearing
from
the
lounge
doorway
of
the
cabin
superstructure
i
fired
again
and
the
running
man
tumbled
forward
on
his
face
he
was
the
last
of
the
pirate
crew
molo
was
crouching
forward
over
his
instrument
table
with
snap
gun
upon
him
the
girls
burst
upon
us
we
armed
them
meka
was
safely
fastened
down
below
we
backed
molo
to
the
floor
in
the
corner
with
venza
and
anita
watching
him
snap
and
i
were
in
control
of
the
ship
for
temporary
periods
the
automatics
would
handle
the
i
could
operate
them
here
from
the
turret
we
had
a
downward
velocity
toward
the
moon
five
hundred
miles
below
us
no
more
was
the
base
of
that
diabolical
which
was
so
swiftly
pulling
the
grantline
ships
to
their
destruction
i
gripped
snap
and
told
him
what
we
must
do
the
forward
gun
on
the
starboard
side
is
almost
identical
with
our
earth
guns
the
francine
projectors
with
a
short
range
you
can
handle
it
and
i
give
you
a
close
mark
he
dashed
for
the
deck
i
set
the
levers
with
full
bow
attraction
stern
repulsion
to
the
earth
and
the
stern
at
highest
power
the
responded
smoothly
with
acceleration
such
as
only
molo
famous
terror
of
the
starways
could
attain
we
dove
for
the
moon
breathless
minutes
those
wandl
ships
up
in
the
firmament
behind
our
stern
would
probably
do
nothing
they
would
not
understand
this
sudden
move
of
their
friendly
ship
the
brain
masters
the
wandlites
down
on
the
moon
rocks
operating
the
mechanism
of
the
would
not
suspect
until
too
late
what
the
was
doing
uprushing
rocks
the
apennines
to
one
side
the
dark
yawning
maw
of
archimedes
on
the
other
we
were
diving
parallel
with
the
now
hardly
a
mile
from
it
diving
for
the
mechanisms
of
its
source
twenty
thousand
feet
of
altitude
i
bent
our
up
for
the
start
of
our
turning
next
ten
thousand
feet
five
thousand
how
close
we
went
i
never
knew
it
was
seconds
now
not
minutes
i
shifted
all
the
controls
our
bow
lifted
as
we
straightened
the
whole
spreading
lunar
surface
tilted
and
dipped
snap
fired
i
saw
the
bolt
flash
at
the
tilting
landscape
and
a
puff
of
light
down
there
on
the
rocks
and
an
instant
later
there
were
vacant
rocks
where
the
little
cluster
of
men
and
mechanisms
had
been
and
the
upflung
was
gone
the
giant
towering
cliffs
of
the
mountain
of
archimedes
seemed
to
rush
at
our
upturning
bow
the
great
dark
slid
under
our
hull
but
we
cleared
it
the
maw
of
blackness
slid
down
and
away
the
whole
lunar
world
tilted
down
and
dwindled
as
we
mounted
again
into
the
starlight
minutes
passed
while
we
mounted
above
our
upstanding
bow
was
a
new
drama
the
grantline
ships
almost
level
with
the
ten
wandl
vessels
when
the
ray
vanished
turned
sidewise
the
poised
wandl
craft
devoid
of
velocity
could
not
pick
up
the
ray
to
escape
now
grantline
for
those
minutes
ignored
the
frantically
flung
discs
it
was
a
desperate
encounter
all
at
close
quarters
we
saw
the
spitting
puffing
lights
and
the
silent
turmoil
hidden
presently
by
the
spreading
clouds
of
luminous
fog
then
out
of
it
came
drifting
the
wreckage
we
plunged
through
an
end
of
the
glowing
fog
encountered
nothing
but
two
triumphant
venus
vessels
with
them
we
mounted
into
the
upper
starlight
this
was
the
end
of
the
battle
the
victorious
grantline
ships
one
by
one
came
lunging
up
only
twelve
of
them
now
no
wandl
vessels
were
left
the
great
spreading
cloud
drifted
down
like
a
shroud
to
hide
the
wreckage
drifted
and
settled
to
the
lunar
surface
a
great
radiant
area
of
fog
gleaming
in
the
earthlight
there
is
very
little
more
pertinent
to
this
narrative
that
i
need
add
of
the
events
on
earth
venus
and
mars
during
this
momentous
summer
the
main
facts
are
history
now
the
wild
storms
the
damage
done
by
outraged
nature
and
the
panic
among
the
people
all
of
it
has
been
detailed
as
public
news
the
strange
planted
by
wandl
in
greater
new
york
grebhar
and
have
not
yet
burned
themselves
away
but
they
are
lessening
and
scientists
say
that
they
will
soon
be
gone
the
changed
calendars
call
this
the
new
era
the
axis
of
each
of
the
three
worlds
was
not
appreciably
altered
the
climates
are
at
last
restoring
to
normal
but
the
axial
rotations
of
all
three
planets
were
slowed
by
that
attacking
wandl
beam
before
we
wrecked
the
gravity
station
the
earth
day
has
been
lengthened
resulting
in
the
new
calendar
the
new
era
our
year
formerly
of
approximately
days
now
contains
but
days
molo
and
meka
have
been
returned
to
they
were
tried
there
for
piracy
and
treason
and
are
imprisoned
and
wandl
with
her
wrecked
wandl
became
subject
to
the
balancing
celestial
forces
during
those
succeeding
months
of
the
summer
and
autumn
no
other
spaceships
appeared
from
her
nor
did
our
world
investigate
her
presence
here
even
a
little
world
the
size
of
the
moon
was
causing
disturbance
enough
wandl
moved
with
slow
velocity
like
a
dallying
strangely
sluggish
comet
about
to
round
our
sun
what
would
her
final
orbit
be
by
fortunate
chance
she
headed
in
far
from
the
earth
and
venus
missed
mercury
by
a
wide
margin
went
close
around
the
sun
came
out
again
but
the
pull
of
the
sun
and
mercury
dragged
her
back
her
velocity
was
not
great
enough
i
recall
that
late
autumn
afternoon
when
with
anita
snap
and
venza
i
sat
in
the
observatory
near
washington
gazing
at
wandl
through
the
dark
glass
of
the
doomed
invader
she
showed
now
as
a
tiny
dark
dot
over
the
sun
giant
blazing
surface
this
was
her
final
plunge
the
dot
was
presently
swallowed
and
gone
it
seemed
amid
those
giant
licking
streamers
of
blazing
gas
that
there
was
an
extra
puff
of
light
and
some
claim
now
that
for
a
brief
time
our
sunlight
was
a
trifle
warmer
a
little
pyre
to
mark
the
end
of
wandl
the
invader
a
classic
novel
of
interplanetary
warfare
there
were
nine
major
planets
in
the
solar
system
and
it
was
within
their
boundaries
that
man
first
set
up
interplanetary
commerce
and
began
trading
with
the
ancient
martian
civilization
and
then
they
discovered
a
tenth
planet
a
maverick
this
tenth
world
if
it
had
an
orbit
had
a
strange
one
for
it
was
heading
inwards
from
interstellar
space
heading
close
to
the
spaceways
upsetting
astronautic
calculations
and
raising
turmoil
on
the
two
inhabited
worlds
but
even
so
none
suspected
then
just
how
much
trouble
this
new
world
would
make
for
it
was
wandl
the
invader
and
it
was
no
barren
planetoid
it
was
a
manned
world
manned
by
minds
and
monsters
and
traveling
into
our
system
with
a
purpose
beyond
that
of
astronomical
accident
it
a
terrific
novel
from
the
classic
days
of
great
adventure
now
first
published
in
book
form
when
ray
cummings
took
leave
of
this
planet
early
in
the

the

of
this
talented
writer
supplied
a
great
many
of
the
most
basic
themes
upon
which
the
present
superstructure
of
is
based
following
the
lead
of
jules
verne
and
wells
cummings
successfully
bridged
the
gap
between
the
early
dawning
of
in
the
last
decades
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
the
full
flowering
of
the
field
in
these
middle
decades
of
the
twentieth
