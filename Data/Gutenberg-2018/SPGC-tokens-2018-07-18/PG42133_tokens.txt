chapter
i
four
girls
face
a
problem
now
that
the
crash
is
over
and
the
last
echo
has
ceased
to
reverberate
through
our
ancestral
halls
the
problem
before
the
house
is
what
shall
the
family
of
vandergrifts
do
next
gloria
i
do
wish
you
would
stand
there
grinning
like
a
cheshire
cat
there
certainly
is
nothing
amusing
about
the
whirlwind
of
a
catastrophe
that
we
have
just
been
through
and
are
still
in
for
that
matter
gwendolyn
tapped
her
toe
impatiently
as
she
sat
in
a
luxuriously
upholstered
chair
in
what
until
this
past
week
had
been
the
library
in
the
long
island
home
of
the
proud
family
of
vandergrifts
gloria
the
oldest
of
the
four
girls
ceased
to
smile
but
the
pleasant
expression
which
was
habitual
to
the
blue
eyes
did
not
entirely
vanish
as
she
inquired
what
would
you
have
me
do
gwen
fret
and
fume
as
you
are
doing
that
is
no
way
to
readjust
your
life
to
new
and
changed
conditions
face
the
facts
squarely
say
i
and
then
try
to
find
some
way
to
surmount
your
difficulties
now
first
of
all
we
ought
the
dark
handsome
gwendolyn
whose
natural
selfishness
was
plainly
portrayed
in
a
drooping
mouth
and
petulant
expression
put
her
fingers
in
her
ears
saying
if
you
are
going
to
preach
i
can
assure
you
that
i
am
not
going
to
listen
so
you
might
as
well
save
your
breath
until
hush
here
comes
lena
may
in
from
the
garden
do
let
her
hear
us
scrapping
it
effects
her
sensitive
soul
as
discord
effects
a
true
musician
lena
may
entered
through
the
porch
door
her
arms
filled
with
blossoming
branches
look
sisters
are
apple
blossoms
even
sweeter
than
usual
this
year
the
slip
of
a
girl
began
then
paused
and
glanced
from
one
face
to
the
other
gwen
what
is
wrong
she
asked
anxiously
but
it
was
gloria
who
replied
nothing
at
all
pet
that
is
nothing
than
usual
if
you
will
permit
my
lapse
of
grammar
but
the
sister
threw
down
the
book
which
she
had
been
trying
to
read
as
she
exclaimed
you
both
know
perfectly
well
than
nothing
could
be
in
more
of
a
muddle
than
our
lives
are
at
the
present
moment
and
your
for
the
silver
lining
philosophy
gloria
vandergrift
help
in
the
least
the
eyes
of
the
frail
youngest
sister
turned
inquiringly
toward
the
oldest
has
anything
more
happened
i
mean
anything
new
she
asked
yes
dear
we
had
a
letter
from
father
lawyer
and
he
states
than
beyond
a
doubt
our
place
here
on
long
island
does
not
belong
to
us
and
for
that
matter
it
never
did
really
grandfather
bought
it
in
good
faith
i
am
sure
but
he
did
not
receive
a
clear
title
then
why
does
our
lawyer
clear
it
up
that
what
i
like
to
know
gwen
said
throwing
herself
petulantly
into
another
position
why
did
father
employ
him
if
he
can
not
attend
to
our
legal
matters
but
gwen
dear
ca
you
understand
gloria
began
to
explain
with
infinite
patience
when
father
died
leaving
four
orphaned
daughters
we
knew
that
the
fortune
he
had
inherited
had
been
lost
through
unwise
investments
but
we
did
think
that
the
income
from
this
vast
acreage
and
the
tenants
would
be
sufficient
to
permit
us
to
live
in
about
the
same
comfortable
way
that
we
always
have
but
now
we
find
that
even
this
place
is
not
ours
and
that
we
are
well
up
against
it
as
bobs
would
say
where
is
bobs
this
from
lena
may
who
was
arranging
the
sprays
of
apple
blossoms
in
a
large
bowl
on
a
low
wicker
stand
look
out
of
yonder
window
and
you
will
see
the
object
of
your
inquiry
gloria
laughed
as
she
pointed
toward
the
grounds
where
a
hoidenish
young
girl
of
could
be
seen
riding
astride
a
slender
black
horse
with
a
white
star
in
his
forehead
i
do
wish
roberta
would
wear
that
outlandish
costume
gwendolyn
began
and
what
more
i
ca
see
why
she
wants
to
be
galloping
around
the
country
in
that
fashion
when
a
calamity
like
this
is
staring
us
in
the
face
the
horse
had
disappeared
beyond
the
shrubbery
the
sisters
supposed
that
the
young
rider
would
go
down
to
the
stables
and
so
they
were
somewhat
startled
a
second
later
by
seeing
bobs
vault
over
the
sill
of
an
open
window
and
land
in
their
midst
gwendolyn
of
course
rebuked
her
roberta
vandergrift
are
you
ever
going
to
become
ladylike
she
admonished
the
newcomer
was
about
to
retort
that
she
hoped
not
if
gwen
was
a
sample
but
gloria
intervened
do
be
ladylike
bobs
she
said
now
more
than
ever
we
need
a
man
in
the
family
but
come
let
talk
peaceably
together
and
decide
what
we
are
to
do
all
right
roberta
tossed
her
hat
to
one
side
and
sat
on
the
floor
adding
fire
ahead
i
present
such
language
was
what
gwendolyn
refrained
from
saying
but
bobs
chuckled
in
wicked
glee
she
thought
it
jolly
fun
to
shock
miss
prunes
and
prisms
as
she
called
the
sister
but
one
year
her
senior
gloria
whatever
you
suggest
i
know
will
be
best
little
lena
may
said
as
she
slipped
a
trusting
hand
into
that
of
the
oldest
sister
now
tell
us
what
is
your
plan
the
oldest
girl
was
thoughtful
for
a
moment
then
said
honestly
i
do
know
that
i
have
made
one
very
far
ahead
but
of
course
we
must
leave
here
that
is
the
inevitable
and
equally
of
course
we
must
find
some
way
of
earning
our
daily
bread
bread
indeed
sniffed
the
disdainful
gwendolyn
you
know
that
i
never
eat
such
a
plebian
thing
as
bread
well
you
may
work
to
earn
cake
if
you
prefer
bobs
told
her
then
leaning
forward
she
added
eagerly
i
say
gloria
it
going
to
be
a
great
adventure
is
it
i
always
been
so
envious
of
people
who
actually
earned
their
own
way
in
the
world
it
shows
there
is
something
in
them
anyone
can
be
a
parasite
but
the
person
who
is
worth
while
is
contented
to
be
one
ever
since
kathryn
de
laney
went
to
little
old
new
york
town
to
take
a
course
in
nursing
that
she
might
do
something
big
in
the
world
i
had
the
itch
to
do
likewise
getting
up
at
noon
and
then
dwaddling
away
the
hours
until
midnight
is
all
very
well
for
those
who
like
it
but
not
for
mine
i
been
wishing
that
something
would
jar
us
out
of
the
rut
we
in
and
i
for
one
am
glad
that
it
has
come
kathryn
de
laney
is
a
disgrace
to
her
family
this
scornfully
from
gwen
a
girl
with
a
million
in
her
own
name
could
hire
people
to
do
all
the
nursing
she
wished
done
without
going
into
dirty
slummy
places
herself
and
actually
waiting
on
immigrants
the
very
sight
of
whom
would
make
me
feel
ill
i
never
even
permit
hawkins
to
drive
me
through
the
poorer
sections
of
the
city
and
if
i
am
obliged
to
pass
through
the
tenement
district
i
close
the
windows
that
i
need
not
breath
the
polluted
air
and
i
also
draw
the
curtains
i
no
doubt
that
you
do
bobs
said
eyeing
her
sister
almost
coldly
i
sometimes
wonder
where
our
mother
got
you
anyway
you
have
one
resemblance
to
that
dear
little
woman
who
when
the
squalid
hamlet
down
by
the
sound
was
burned
opened
her
home
and
took
them
all
in
we
were
too
small
to
remember
it
ourselves
but
i
heard
father
tell
about
it
time
and
again
and
he
would
always
end
the
story
by
saying
dearest
wish
is
that
my
four
girls
each
grow
up
to
be
just
such
an
angel
woman
as
their
mother
was
nor
was
that
all
lena
may
put
in
a
tender
light
glowing
in
her
soft
brown
eyes
mother
herself
superintended
the
rebuilding
of
the
hamlet
which
has
now
grown
to
be
the
model
town
along
the
sound
then
looking
lovingly
up
at
the
oldest
sister
she
continued
i
glad
gloria
that
you
are
so
like
our
mother
but
you
have
as
yet
told
me
your
plan
and
i
am
sure
that
you
must
at
least
have
the
beginning
of
one
well
as
i
said
before
we
must
leave
here
and
go
to
work
gloria
replied
i
suppose
the
best
thing
would
be
for
us
to
go
to
new
york
where
so
many
varieties
of
endeavor
await
us
corey
thinks
that
there
will
be
about
one
hundred
dollars
a
month
for
us
to
live
on
that
will
be
dollars
for
each
of
us
and
dollars
indeed
i
ca
even
get
a
hat
for
that
and
i
certainly
shall
need
one
to
wear
to
phyllis
de
laney
lawn
party
on
the
of
june
if
but
you
wo
be
here
then
gwen
so
you
might
as
well
not
plan
to
attend
gloria
said
seriously
we
are
obliged
to
vacate
this
place
by
the
first
of
june
the
grabbersteins
who
claim
their
ancestors
were
the
original
owners
will
move
in
on
that
day
bag
and
baggage
and
so
my
suggestion
is
that
we
leave
the
week
previous
that
we
need
not
meet
them
have
you
thought
what
you
will
do
to
earn
money
lena
may
asked
gloria
yes
miss
lovejoy
of
the
east
street
settlement
has
asked
me
to
take
charge
of
the
girls
clubs
and
i
have
accepted
gloria
vandergrift
you
a
daughter
of
one
of
the
very
oldest
families
in
this
country
to
work
actually
work
in
those
dreadful
smelling
slums
gloria
looked
almost
with
pity
at
the
speaker
who
of
course
was
gwendolyn
as
she
said
do
you
realize
that
being
born
an
aristocrat
is
merely
an
accident
you
might
have
been
born
in
the
slums
gwen
and
if
you
had
been
would
you
be
glad
to
have
someone
come
to
you
and
give
you
a
chance
there
being
no
reply
gloria
continued
i
take
no
credit
to
myself
because
i
happened
to
be
born
in
luxury
and
not
in
poverty
but
have
to
postpone
this
conversation
for
our
neighbors
are
evidently
coming
to
call
bobs
sprang
to
her
feet
and
leaped
to
the
open
window
hello
there
phyl
and
dick
come
around
this
way
and
i
open
the
porch
door
gwendolyn
shrugged
her
shoulders
why
does
roberta
allow
peter
to
admit
our
visitors
she
began
but
gloria
interrupted
one
excellent
reason
perhaps
is
that
all
our
servants
except
the
cook
left
this
morning
you
of
course
were
still
asleep
and
did
not
know
of
the
exodus
the
sharp
retort
on
the
tongue
of
gwendolyn
was
not
uttered
for
phyllis
de
laney
and
her
big
brother
richard
were
entering
the
library
you
poor
dear
girls
just
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
news
i
came
right
over
phyllis
de
laney
exclaimed
as
she
sank
down
in
a
deep
comfortable
chair
and
looked
about
at
her
friends
with
an
expression
of
frank
curiosity
on
her
face
however
i
told
ma
mere
that
i
knew
there
was
a
word
of
truth
in
the
scandalous
gossip
and
so
i
came
to
hear
how
it
all
started
that
i
may
be
able
to
contradict
it
phyllis
took
a
breath
and
then
continued
her
chatter
your
maid
gwen
told
my
fanchon
and
she
said
that
every
servant
in
your
employ
had
been
dismissed
with
two
weeks
advance
pay
and
she
said
a
good
deal
more
than
that
too
which
of
course
is
true
just
listen
to
this
and
then
tell
me
if
it
is
simply
scandalous
that
maid
declared
that
you
girls
are
going
to
work
actually
work
to
earn
your
own
living
i
say
it
true
roberta
put
in
grinning
with
wicked
glee
her
good
pal
dick
smiled
over
at
her
as
he
remarked
with
evident
amusement
you
do
look
very
miserable
about
it
bobs
in
fact
quite
the
contrary
you
appear
pleased
if
the
truth
were
known
i
envy
you
honestly
i
do
i
much
rather
go
to
work
than
go
to
college
i
no
good
at
latin
or
greek
if
languages
are
dead
bury
them
i
say
i
not
a
student
by
nature
so
what
the
use
pretending
but
the
pater
wo
hear
to
it
just
because
our
grandfather
left
us
each
a
million
we
got
to
dwaddle
away
our
lives
spending
it
of
course
i
nineteen
now
but
you
wait
until
i
years
old
and
see
what
will
happen
his
sister
phyllis
lifted
her
eyebrows
ever
so
slightly
and
looked
her
disapproval
in
that
time
you
will
have
changed
your
mind
she
remarked
then
turning
to
her
particular
friend
she
added
but
gwen
you
are
going
to
work
are
you
pray
what
could
you
do
gwendolyn
was
in
no
pleasant
frame
of
mind
as
her
sisters
well
knew
and
her
reply
was
most
ungraciously
given
curtly
she
stated
that
she
did
not
care
to
discuss
her
personal
affairs
with
anyone
phyllis
flushed
and
rose
at
once
saying
coldly
indeed
since
when
have
you
become
so
secretive
you
always
tell
me
everything
you
do
and
so
i
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
you
would
object
to
my
friendly
inquiry
but
you
need
have
no
fear
i
shall
never
again
intrude
upon
your
privacy
i
will
bid
you
all
good
afternoon
and
for
of
course
since
you
are
going
to
new
york
to
work
i
suppose
as
clerks
in
the
shops
we
will
not
likely
meet
again
aw
i
say
sis
cut
it
out
what
the
big
idea
anyway
a
friend
is
a
friend
is
he
whether
he
wears
broadcloth
or
overalls
then
as
his
sister
continued
to
sweep
out
of
the
room
the
lad
crossed
to
the
oldest
sister
and
held
out
his
hand
saying
with
sincere
boyish
sympathy
gloria
i
mighty
sorry
about
this
er
this
well
whatever
it
is
and
please
let
me
know
where
you
go
and
as
soon
as
you
settled
i
run
over
and
play
the
big
brother
act
if
you
let
me
then
turning
to
bobs
he
said
go
riding
with
me
at
sunrise
tomorrow
morning
will
you
like
we
used
to
do
before
i
went
away
to
school
there
a
lot
i
want
to
say
and
the
day
after
i
going
to
be
packed
off
to
the
academy
again
to
be
tortured
for
another
month
then
thanks
be
vacation
will
let
me
out
of
that
prison
for
a
while
roberta
hesitated
and
dick
urged
go
on
bob
be
a
sport
say
yes
all
right
i
be
at
the
twin
oaks
where
we
met
ever
since
we
were
little
shavers
when
the
door
closed
behind
the
departing
guests
gloria
turned
to
the
sister
who
was
but
one
year
her
junior
and
said
gwendolyn
i
am
sorry
to
say
this
but
the
good
of
the
larger
number
requires
it
if
you
can
not
face
the
changed
conditions
cheerfully
with
us
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
make
your
plans
independent
of
us
we
three
have
decided
to
be
brave
and
courageous
and
try
to
find
joy
and
happiness
in
whatever
may
present
itself
just
as
our
mother
and
father
would
wish
us
to
do
and
just
as
they
would
have
done
had
similar
circumstances
overtaken
them
gwendolyn
rose
and
walked
toward
the
door
but
turned
to
say
you
need
not
concern
yourselves
about
me
in
the
least
i
shall
not
go
with
you
to
new
york
i
shall
visit
my
dear
friend
eloise
rochester
in
newport
as
she
has
often
begged
me
to
do
an
excellent
plan
if
gloria
began
then
paused
gwendolyn
turned
and
inquired
haughtily
if
what
if
eloise
wants
you
when
she
hears
that
you
have
neither
home
nor
wealth
if
i
am
anything
of
a
character
reader
i
should
say
that
the
invitation
about
which
you
have
just
told
was
merely
a
bait
so
to
speak
for
a
return
invitation
it
is
quite
evident
that
eloise
has
decided
to
marry
richard
de
laney
inheritance
and
since
phyllis
will
not
invite
her
to
their
home
you
as
a
neighbor
can
be
used
to
advantage
indeed
well
luckily
miss
vandergrift
you
are
a
character
reader
as
you
will
learn
in
the
near
future
you
three
make
whatever
plans
you
wish
but
do
not
include
me
so
saying
gwendolyn
left
the
room
and
a
few
moments
later
the
three
sisters
heard
her
moving
about
in
the
apartment
overhead
and
they
correctly
assumed
that
she
was
packing
preparatory
for
her
departure
to
newport
gloria
sighed
i
wonder
why
gwen
is
so
unlike
our
mother
and
father
she
said
i
have
it
bobs
cried
whirling
about
with
eyes
laughingly
aglow
she
a
changeling
a
discontented
nurse
girl
wished
to
wreak
vengeance
upon
mother
for
having
discharged
her
or
something
like
that
and
so
she
stole
the
child
who
really
was
our
sister
and
left
this
do
bobsie
lena
may
protested
even
if
gwen
is
selfish
maybe
we
are
to
blame
she
was
ill
for
so
long
after
mother
died
that
we
bear
the
thought
of
having
two
deaths
and
so
we
rather
spoiled
her
i
believe
that
if
we
meet
her
contrariness
with
love
and
are
very
patient
we
may
find
the
gold
that
must
be
in
her
nature
since
she
our
mother
child
you
can
do
it
if
it
lena
may
bobs
declared
now
gloria
break
the
glad
news
when
do
we
hit
the
trail
for
the
big
town
i
going
in
tomorrow
to
find
a
place
for
us
to
live
if
you
girls
wish
you
may
accompany
me
wish
why
all
the
king
oxen
and
all
the
king
men
could
keep
me
from
going
gloria
smiled
at
her
hoidenish
sister
but
refrained
from
commenting
on
her
language
she
was
so
thankful
that
there
was
only
one
gwen
in
the
family
that
she
could
overlook
lesser
failings
bobs
was
taking
the
mishap
that
had
befallen
them
as
a
great
adventure
but
even
she
did
not
dream
of
the
truly
exciting
adventures
that
lay
before
them
chapter
ii
a
proposal
soon
after
daybreak
the
next
morning
down
a
deserted
country
road
two
thoroughbred
horses
were
galloping
neck
and
neck
gee
along
star
bobs
was
shouting
she
had
lost
her
hat
a
mile
back
and
her
short
hair
which
would
ripple
though
she
tried
hard
to
brush
out
the
natural
curls
was
tossed
about
her
head
making
her
look
more
hoidenish
than
ever
dick
on
his
slender
brown
horse
gradually
won
a
lead
and
was
a
length
ahead
when
they
reached
the
twin
oaks
which
for
many
years
had
been
their
trysting
place
roberta
and
dick
had
been
playmates
and
then
pals
squabbling
and
making
up
ever
since
the
pinafore
days
more
however
like
two
boys
than
a
boy
and
a
girl
bobs
in
fact
never
thought
of
herself
as
a
young
person
who
in
due
time
would
become
a
marriageable
young
lady
and
so
it
was
with
rather
a
shock
of
surprise
that
she
heard
dick
say
when
they
had
drawn
their
horses
to
a
standstill
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
i
say
roberta
could
you
cut
out
this
going
to
work
stuff
and
marry
me
ye
gods
and
little
fishes
marry
you
bobs
remark
and
the
accompanying
expression
in
her
round
sunburned
face
with
its
pertly
tilting
freckled
nose
were
none
too
complimentary
dick
flushed
well
i
say
what
the
matter
with
me
anyhow
anyone
might
think
by
the
way
you
staring
that
i
had
said
something
dreadful
i
not
deformed
am
i
and
i
got
money
enough
so
you
would
have
to
work
ever
and
roberta
became
a
girl
at
once
a
girl
with
a
sincere
nature
and
a
tender
heart
reaching
out
a
strong
brown
hand
she
placed
it
kindly
on
the
arm
of
her
friend
dicky
boy
forgive
me
if
if
i
was
a
little
astonished
and
showed
it
truth
is
for
so
many
years
i
thought
of
you
as
the
playmate
i
could
always
count
on
to
fight
my
battles
that
i
sort
of
forgotten
that
we
were
grown
up
enough
to
even
think
of
marrying
of
course
we
are
grown
up
enough
yet
to
really
marry
for
you
are
only
nineteen
and
i
worse
than
that
being
not
yet
seventeen
and
as
for
money
dick
i
like
you
heaps
better
if
you
were
poor
and
working
your
way
but
i
know
that
you
meant
what
you
said
most
kindly
you
wanted
to
save
me
from
hard
knocks
but
dick
honest
injun
i
revel
in
them
that
is
i
suppose
i
will
never
having
had
one
as
yet
i
ca
speak
from
past
experience
then
they
rode
slowly
back
to
find
the
hat
that
had
blown
off
into
the
bushes
dick
rescued
it
and
when
he
returned
it
he
handed
her
a
spray
from
a
blossoming
wild
rose
vine
the
lad
did
not
again
refer
to
his
offer
and
the
girl
he
noted
with
an
inward
sigh
had
evidently
forgotten
all
about
it
she
was
gazing
about
her
appreciatively
dicky
boy
she
exclaimed
there
nothing
much
prettier
than
early
morning
in
the
country
is
there
with
the
dew
still
sparkling
and
a
meadow
lark
singing
she
added
for
at
that
moment
a
joyous
song
arose
from
a
thicket
for
a
time
they
were
silent
as
they
rode
slowly
back
by
the
way
they
had
come
then
dick
said
bobs
since
you
love
the
country
so
dearly
you
afraid
you
be
homesick
in
that
human
whirlpool
new
york
the
girl
turned
toward
him
brightly
perhaps
sometimes
she
replied
but
it
is
far
to
the
country
when
i
feel
the
need
of
a
deep
breath
of
fresh
air
then
her
face
saddened
as
she
continued
of
course
we
be
coming
out
here
any
more
she
waved
toward
the
vast
estate
which
for
many
years
had
been
the
home
of
vandergrifts
we
could
stand
it
not
one
of
us
could
to
see
strangers
living
where
mother
and
father
were
so
happy
they
probably
change
things
a
lot
then
she
added
almost
passionately
i
hope
they
will
then
if
ever
i
see
it
again
it
will
not
look
like
the
same
place
dick
did
not
say
what
was
in
his
heart
but
gloomily
he
realized
that
if
the
girl
at
his
side
did
not
expect
ever
to
return
to
that
neighborhood
it
was
quite
evident
that
she
would
not
be
his
wife
for
his
home
adjoined
that
of
the
vandergrifts
when
he
spoke
his
words
in
no
way
betrayed
his
thoughts
have
you
any
idea
bobs
what
you
like
to
do
over
there
in
the
big
city
i
mean
to
make
a
living
the
girl
laughed
then
sent
a
merry
side
glance
toward
her
companion
you
never
could
guess
in
a
thousand
years
she
flung
at
him
then
challenged
try
the
boy
flicked
his
quirt
at
the
drooping
branches
of
a
willow
they
were
passing
then
frankly
confessed
that
he
could
picture
roberta
in
any
of
the
occupations
for
women
of
which
he
had
ever
heard
mischievously
she
queried
would
i
make
a
nice
demure
saleswoman
for
dresses
or
great
guns
was
the
explosive
interruption
do
put
such
a
strain
on
my
imagination
then
he
laughed
gaily
for
he
was
evidently
trying
to
picture
the
hoidenish
girl
mincing
up
and
down
in
some
fashionable
emporium
dressed
in
the
latest
styles
while
women
peered
at
her
through
lorgnettes
bobs
laughed
with
him
when
he
told
his
thoughts
then
said
i
agree
as
a
model
i
wo
do
then
with
pretended
thoughtfulness
she
flicked
a
fly
from
her
horse
ear
would
i
make
a
good
actress
dicky
do
you
think
you
make
a
better
circus
performer
the
boy
told
her
i
never
forget
the
antics
we
used
to
pull
before
before
i
realized
that
i
was
a
girl
and
to
be
ladylike
bobs
laughed
with
him
then
added
merrily
if
it
had
been
for
my
prunes
and
prisms
sister
gwendolyn
i
might
have
ceased
to
be
a
i
hope
you
never
will
become
like
gwen
dick
said
almost
fiercely
or
like
my
sister
phyllis
either
they
not
though
i
sorry
to
say
it
then
noting
a
thoughtful
expression
which
had
crept
into
the
girl
eyes
the
lad
inquired
say
bobs
have
you
any
idea
gwyn
earn
a
living
you
the
sort
who
can
hold
your
own
anywhere
you
be
willing
to
work
but
gwyn
well
i
ca
picture
her
as
a
earner
his
companion
shook
her
head
then
quite
unexpectedly
she
said
dick
why
you
fall
in
love
with
gwen
it
would
have
solved
her
problem
to
have
had
someone
nice
and
rich
to
take
care
of
her
well
of
all
the
unheard
of
preposterous
suggestions
the
amazed
youth
was
so
astonished
that
he
unconsciously
drew
rein
and
stared
at
the
girl
he
knew
by
her
merry
laugh
that
she
had
said
it
but
to
tease
and
so
he
rode
on
again
at
her
side
bobs
feared
that
she
had
hurt
her
friend
for
his
face
was
still
flushed
and
he
did
not
speak
reining
her
horse
close
to
his
she
again
put
a
hand
on
his
arm
saying
with
sincere
earnestness
forgive
me
pal
of
mine
if
i
seemed
to
speak
lightly
honestly
i
did
mean
it
that
is
not
as
it
sounded
but
i
wish
that
someone
as
nice
and
yes
i
say
as
rich
as
you
are
propose
to
poor
gwen
you
do
know
how
sorry
gloria
and
i
feel
because
gwen
has
to
be
poor
with
the
rest
of
us
the
boy
had
placed
his
hand
over
the
one
resting
on
his
arm
but
only
for
a
moment
you
see
bobs
explained
glow
and
i
honestly
feel
that
an
adventure
of
a
new
and
interesting
kind
awaits
us
and
as
for
little
lena
may
money
means
nothing
to
her
if
she
can
just
be
with
gloria
that
is
all
she
asks
of
fate
they
had
reached
the
vandergrift
gate
and
bobs
drawing
rein
reached
out
her
hand
saying
goodbye
dick
then
after
a
hesitating
moment
she
added
sincerely
i
sorry
old
pal
i
wish
i
could
have
said
yes
that
is
if
it
means
a
lot
to
you
the
boy
held
her
hand
in
a
firm
clasp
as
he
replied
earnestly
i
not
going
to
give
up
hoping
bobsie
i
put
that
question
on
the
table
for
a
couple
of
years
but
when
i
am
i
going
to
hit
the
trail
for
you
are
and
ask
it
all
over
again
you
see
if
i
do
you
wo
if
eloise
rochester
has
anything
to
say
about
it
was
the
girl
merry
rejoinder
then
as
bobs
turned
her
horse
toward
the
stables
she
called
over
her
shoulder
o
i
say
dick
i
forgot
to
tell
you
the
profession
i
chosen
i
going
to
a
girl
detective
chapter
iii
venturing
forth
when
roberta
entered
the
breakfast
room
she
found
gloria
and
lena
may
there
waiting
for
her
in
answer
to
her
question
the
oldest
sister
replied
that
gwen
would
not
unlock
her
door
lena
may
had
left
her
breakfast
on
a
tray
in
the
hall
we
think
she
is
packing
to
leave
gloria
sighed
the
way
gwen
takes
our
misfortune
is
the
hardest
thing
about
it
bobs
who
was
ravenously
hungry
after
her
early
morning
ride
was
eating
her
breakfast
with
a
relish
which
contrasted
noticeably
with
the
evident
lack
of
appetite
shown
by
her
sisters
at
last
she
said
glow
i
not
so
sure
all
this
is
really
a
misfortune
if
something
had
happened
to
jolt
us
out
of
a
rut
we
would
have
settled
down
here
and
led
a
humdrum
monotonous
life
going
to
teas
and
receptions
bridge
parties
and
played
tennis
and
golf
married
and
died
and
nothing
real
or
vital
would
have
happened
but
now
take
it
from
me
i
for
one
am
going
to
really
live
not
stagnate
or
rust
gloria
smiled
as
she
hastened
to
assure
her
sister
i
agree
with
you
bobs
i
glad
something
happened
to
make
it
possible
for
me
to
carry
out
a
desire
of
mine
i
have
said
much
about
it
but
ever
since
kathryn
de
laney
came
home
last
summer
on
a
vacation
and
told
me
about
the
girls
of
the
east
side
who
have
never
had
a
real
chance
to
develop
the
best
that
is
in
them
i
have
wanted
to
help
them
i
know
how
to
go
about
doing
it
not
until
the
crash
came
then
i
wrote
kathryn
and
you
know
what
happened
next
she
found
a
place
for
me
in
the
settlement
house
to
conduct
social
clubs
for
those
very
girls
of
whom
she
had
told
me
both
of
the
listeners
noted
the
eager
earnest
expression
on
the
truly
beautiful
face
of
the
sister
who
had
mothered
them
but
almost
at
once
it
had
saddened
and
they
knew
that
again
she
was
thinking
of
gwen
directly
after
breakfast
gloria
went
once
more
to
the
upper
hall
and
tapped
on
a
closed
and
locked
door
but
there
was
no
response
from
within
however
the
breakfast
tray
which
lena
may
had
left
on
a
near
table
was
not
in
sight
and
so
at
least
gwendolyn
was
not
going
hungry
it
seemed
strange
to
the
two
younger
girls
to
be
clearing
away
the
breakfast
things
and
tidying
up
the
kitchen
where
for
so
many
years
a
chinaman
had
reigned
supreme
i
going
to
miss
sing
more
than
any
servant
that
we
ever
had
bobs
was
saying
when
gloria
entered
the
kitchen
there
was
a
serious
expression
on
the
face
of
the
oldest
girl
and
bobs
refrained
from
uttering
the
flippancy
which
had
been
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
lena
may
having
put
away
the
dishes
turned
to
ask
solicitously
would
gwen
let
you
in
glow
no
i
did
hear
a
sound
but
the
tray
is
gone
the
gentle
lena
may
was
pleased
to
hear
that
poor
gwen
she
is
making
it
harder
for
herself
and
for
all
of
us
gloria
said
then
added
are
you
girls
ready
to
go
with
me
i
like
to
get
over
to
the
city
early
after
the
first
rush
is
over
and
the
midday
rush
has
not
begun
exultant
bobs
could
not
refrain
from
waving
the
dishcloth
she
still
held
hurray
for
us
she
sang
out
three
adventurers
starting
on
they
know
not
what
wild
escapade
wait
until
i
change
my
togs
glow
and
i
be
with
you
then
glancing
down
at
her
riding
habit
unless
this
will
do
she
questioned
her
sister
of
course
not
dear
we
all
wear
tailored
suits
it
was
midmorning
when
three
fashionably
attired
girls
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
ascended
to
the
third
avenue
elevated
going
uptown
at
that
hour
there
were
few
people
traveling
in
that
direction
and
they
had
a
car
almost
to
themselves
as
they
were
whirled
past
tenements
so
close
that
they
could
plainly
see
the
shabby
furniture
in
the
flats
beyond
the
younger
girls
suddenly
realized
how
great
was
the
contrast
between
the
life
that
was
ahead
of
them
and
that
which
they
were
leaving
the
thundering
of
the
trains
the
constant
rumble
of
traffic
below
the
discordant
cries
of
hucksters
reached
them
through
the
open
windows
it
hard
to
believe
that
a
meadow
lark
is
singing
anywhere
in
the
world
bobs
said
turning
to
gloria
or
that
little
children
are
playing
in
those
meadows
the
older
girl
replied
she
was
watching
the
pale
ragged
children
hanging
to
railings
around
fire
escapes
on
a
level
with
the
train
windows
poor
little
things
lena
may
tone
was
pitying
i
do
see
how
they
can
do
much
playing
in
such
cramped
crowded
places
i
do
suppose
they
even
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
bobs
replied
they
left
the
train
at
the
station
nearest
the
street
settlement
since
gloria
was
to
be
employed
there
she
planned
starting
from
that
point
to
search
for
the
nearest
suitable
dwelling
they
found
themselves
in
a
motley
crowd
composed
of
foreign
women
and
children
who
jostled
one
another
in
an
evident
effort
to
reach
the
sidewalk
where
in
carts
venders
of
all
kinds
of
things
salable
were
calling
their
wares
they
must
sell
everything
from
fish
to
calico
bobs
reported
after
a
moment
inspection
from
the
curbing
the
women
who
wore
shawls
of
many
colors
over
their
heads
and
who
carried
market
baskets
and
babies
were
some
of
them
bohemians
and
others
hungarian
few
words
of
english
were
heard
by
the
interested
girls
i
see
where
i
have
to
acquire
a
new
tongue
if
i
am
to
know
what
our
future
neighbors
are
talking
about
bobs
had
just
said
when
suddenly
just
ahead
of
them
a
thin
sickly
woman
slipped
and
would
have
fallen
had
not
a
laboring
man
who
was
passing
caught
her
just
in
time
the
grateful
woman
coughed
her
hand
pressed
to
her
throat
before
she
could
thank
him
the
girls
saw
that
she
had
potatoes
in
a
basket
which
seemed
too
heavy
for
her
the
man
was
apparently
asking
where
she
lived
then
he
assisted
her
toward
a
near
tenement
well
bobs
exclaimed
there
is
evidently
chivalry
among
working
men
as
well
as
among
idlers
at
the
crossing
they
were
caught
in
a
jam
of
traffic
and
pedestrians
little
lena
may
clung
to
gloria
arm
looking
about
as
though
terrorized
at
this
new
and
startling
experience
when
after
some
moments
delay
the
opposite
sidewalk
was
reached
in
safety
bobs
exclaimed
gleefully
was
that
great
but
lena
may
had
not
enjoyed
the
experience
and
it
was
quite
evident
to
the
other
two
that
it
was
going
to
be
very
hard
for
their
sensitive
frail
youngest
sister
to
be
transplanted
from
her
gardens
where
she
had
spent
long
quiet
happy
hours
painting
the
scenes
she
loved
to
this
maelstrom
of
foreign
humanity
there
was
almost
a
pang
of
regret
in
the
heart
of
the
girl
who
had
mothered
the
others
when
she
realized
fully
for
the
first
time
what
her
own
choice
of
a
home
location
might
mean
to
their
youngest
perhaps
she
had
been
selfish
because
of
her
own
great
interest
in
settlement
work
to
plan
to
have
them
all
live
on
the
crowded
east
side
but
her
fears
were
set
at
rest
a
moment
later
when
they
came
upon
a
group
of
children
scarcely
more
than
babies
who
were
playing
in
a
gutter
lena
may
sweet
face
brightened
and
smiling
up
at
gloria
she
exclaimed
are
they
dears
in
spite
of
the
rags
and
dirt
i
love
to
do
something
for
them
i
like
to
put
them
all
in
a
tub
of
and
give
them
a
good
scrubbing
for
once
in
their
lives
the
practical
bobs
remarked
then
she
caught
gloria
by
the
arm
exclaiming
as
she
nodded
toward
a
crossing
there
goes
that
chivalrous
laboring
man
he
steps
off
with
too
much
agility
to
be
a
or
anyone
who
does
hard
work
does
he
glow
the
oldest
sister
laughed
bobs
she
remarked
i
sometimes
think
that
you
are
a
detective
by
nature
you
are
always
trying
to
discover
by
the
cut
of
a
man
hair
what
his
profession
may
be
bobs
hazel
eyes
were
merry
though
her
face
was
serious
you
hit
it
glow
she
exclaimed
i
was
going
to
keep
it
a
secret
a
while
longer
but
i
might
as
well
confess
now
that
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag
what
cat
lena
may
had
only
heard
half
of
this
sentence
she
had
been
so
interested
in
watching
the
excitement
among
the
children
caused
by
the
approach
of
an
organ
grinder
my
chosen
profession
is
the
cat
bobs
informed
her
and
i
suppose
my
brain
where
it
has
been
hiding
is
the
bag
i
going
to
be
a
detective
little
lena
may
was
horrified
detectives
meant
to
her
sleuths
who
visited
underground
haunts
of
crooks
of
all
kinds
i
sure
gloria
will
not
wish
it
will
you
glow
appealingly
the
soft
brown
eyes
were
lifted
and
met
the
smiling
gaze
of
the
oldest
sister
we
are
each
to
do
the
work
for
which
we
are
best
fitted
she
replied
you
are
to
be
our
little
housekeeper
and
that
will
give
you
time
to
go
on
with
your
painting
i
was
just
wondering
a
moment
ago
if
you
might
not
like
to
put
some
of
these
hungarian
babies
into
a
picture
if
they
are
clean
they
would
be
unusually
beautiful
lena
may
was
interested
at
once
and
glanced
about
for
possible
subjects
and
so
for
the
time
being
the
startling
statement
of
bobs
chosen
profession
was
dropped
they
were
nearing
the
east
river
very
close
to
which
stood
a
large
plain
brick
building
containing
many
windows
i
believe
that
is
the
settlement
house
gloria
had
just
said
when
bobs
discovering
the
name
over
the
door
verified
the
statement
a
pretty
hungarian
girl
of
about
their
own
age
answered
their
ring
and
admitted
them
to
a
big
cheerful
clubroom
another
girl
was
practicing
on
a
piano
in
a
far
corner
the
three
newcomers
seated
themselves
near
the
door
and
looked
about
with
great
interest
just
beyond
were
shelves
of
books
bobs
sauntered
over
to
look
at
the
titles
it
a
dandy
collection
for
girls
she
reported
as
she
again
took
her
seat
it
was
not
long
before
miss
lovejoy
the
matron
entered
the
room
and
advanced
toward
them
the
three
girls
rose
to
greet
her
miss
lovejoy
smilingly
held
out
a
hand
to
the
tallest
saying
in
her
pleasant
friendly
voice
i
wonder
if
i
am
right
in
believing
that
are
the
miss
gloria
vandergrift
who
is
coming
to
assist
me
yes
miss
lovejoy
i
am
and
these
are
my
younger
sisters
roberta
and
little
lena
may
then
she
explained
we
have
moved
into
town
as
yet
i
thought
best
to
come
over
this
morning
and
find
a
place
for
us
to
live
then
we
will
have
our
trunks
sent
and
our
personal
possessions
that
is
a
good
idea
the
matron
said
then
asked
have
you
found
anything
as
yet
we
thought
since
we
are
strangers
in
the
neighborhood
that
you
might
be
able
to
suggest
some
place
for
us
gloria
told
the
matron
after
a
thoughtful
moment
miss
lovejoy
replied
the
tenement
houses
in
this
immediate
neighborhood
are
most
certainly
not
desirable
for
one
used
to
comforts
however
on
street
there
is
a
new
model
tenement
built
by
some
wealthy
women
and
it
is
just
possible
that
there
may
be
a
vacant
flat
you
might
inquire
at
the
office
there
you
can
take
the
path
across
the
playground
and
it
will
lead
you
directly
to
the
model
tenement
thank
you
miss
lovejoy
gloria
said
we
will
let
you
know
the
result
of
our
search
chapter
iv
a
haunted
house
the
model
tenement
which
miss
lovejoy
had
pointed
out
to
them
was
soon
reached
a
door
on
the
ground
floor
was
labeled
office
and
so
gloria
pushed
the
electric
button
a
trim
young
woman
whose
dark
eyes
suggested
her
nationality
received
them
but
regretted
to
have
to
tell
them
that
every
flat
in
the
model
tenement
was
occupied
she
looked
with
but
slightly
concealed
curiosity
at
these
three
applicants
who
as
was
quite
evident
were
from
other
environments
gloria
glanced
about
the
neat
courtyard
and
up
at
windows
where
flowers
were
blossoming
in
bright
window
boxes
then
glowingly
she
turned
back
to
the
girl
it
was
a
splendid
thing
for
those
wealthy
society
women
to
do
was
it
she
said
erecting
this
really
handsome
yellow
brick
building
in
the
midst
of
so
much
poverty
and
squalor
it
must
have
a
most
uplifting
effect
on
the
lives
of
the
poor
people
to
be
able
to
live
here
where
everything
is
so
sweet
and
clean
rather
than
there
nodding
as
she
spoke
at
a
building
across
the
street
which
looked
gloomy
crumbling
unsafe
and
unsanitary
the
office
attendant
spoke
with
enthusiasm
no
one
knows
better
than
i
for
i
used
to
live
in
the
other
kind
of
tenement
when
i
was
a
child
but
miss
lovejoy
club
for
factory
girls
gave
me
my
chance
to
learn
bookkeeping
and
now
i
am
agent
here
my
name
is
miss
selenski
would
you
like
to
see
the
model
apartment
thank
you
indeed
we
would
gloria
replied
with
enthusiasm
then
she
added
miss
selenski
i
am
miss
vandergrift
and
these
are
my
sisters
roberta
and
lena
may
we
hope
to
be
your
neighbors
soon
if
there
was
a
natural
curiosity
in
the
heart
of
the
girl
she
said
nothing
of
it
and
at
once
led
the
way
through
the
neatly
tiled
halls
and
soon
opened
a
door
admitting
them
to
a
small
flat
of
three
rooms
which
was
clean
and
attractively
furnished
the
windows
flooded
with
sunlight
overlooked
the
east
river
this
is
the
apartment
that
we
show
miss
selenski
explained
the
others
are
just
like
it
or
were
before
tenants
moved
in
she
corrected
say
this
sure
cosy
who
lives
in
this
one
bobs
inquired
i
do
miss
selenski
replied
hurrying
to
add
but
i
did
not
fit
it
up
the
ladies
did
that
it
has
all
the
modern
appliances
that
help
to
make
housekeeping
easy
and
once
every
week
a
teacher
comes
here
to
instruct
the
neighborhood
women
how
to
cook
clean
and
sew
in
fact
how
to
live
and
the
lessons
and
demonstrations
are
given
in
this
apartment
when
the
girls
were
again
in
the
office
gloria
turned
to
their
new
acquaintance
saying
do
you
happen
to
know
of
any
place
around
here
that
is
vacant
where
we
might
like
to
live
at
first
miss
selenski
shook
her
head
then
she
added
with
a
queer
little
smile
not
unless
you
willing
to
live
in
the
old
pensinger
mansion
then
she
went
on
to
explain
long
long
ago
when
new
york
was
little
more
than
a
village
and
street
was
country
all
along
the
east
river
there
were
here
and
there
handsome
homes
and
vast
grounds
oh
so
different
from
what
it
is
now
every
once
in
a
while
you
find
one
of
these
old
dwellings
still
standing
some
of
them
house
many
poor
families
but
the
pensinger
mansion
is
seldom
occupied
if
a
family
is
brave
enough
to
move
in
before
many
weeks
the
rent
sign
is
again
at
the
door
the
rent
is
almost
nothing
but
the
girl
hesitated
then
went
on
to
say
maybe
i
ought
not
to
tell
you
the
story
about
the
old
place
if
you
have
any
thought
of
living
there
oh
please
tell
it
is
it
a
ghost
story
bobs
begged
and
gloria
added
yes
do
tell
it
miss
selenski
we
are
none
of
us
afraid
of
ghosts
of
course
you
are
miss
selenski
agreed
and
for
that
matter
neither
am
i
but
nearly
all
of
our
neighbors
are
superstitious
tenowitz
the
grocer
at
the
corner
of
first
and
has
the
renting
of
the
place
and
he
declares
that
the
last
tenant
rushed
into
his
store
early
one
morning
paid
his
bill
and
departed
without
a
word
of
explanation
but
he
looked
tenowitz
told
me
as
though
he
seen
a
ghost
i
do
think
there
is
anything
the
matter
with
the
old
house
their
informant
continued
except
just
loneliness
of
course
big
barnlike
rooms
when
they
are
empty
echo
every
sound
in
a
mournful
manner
without
supernatural
aid
but
how
did
it
all
start
bobs
inquired
did
anything
of
an
unusual
nature
ever
happen
there
miss
selenski
nodded
and
then
continued
the
story
is
that
the
only
daughter
of
the
last
of
the
pensingers
who
lived
there
disappeared
one
night
and
was
never
again
seen
her
mother
so
the
tale
goes
wished
her
to
marry
an
elderly
english
nobleman
but
she
loved
a
poor
hungarian
violinist
whom
she
was
forbidden
to
see
because
of
her
grief
she
did
many
strange
things
and
one
of
them
was
to
walk
at
midnight
dressed
all
in
white
along
the
brink
of
the
dark
swirling
river
which
edged
the
wide
lawn
in
front
of
her
home
her
white
silk
shawl
was
found
on
the
bank
one
morning
and
the
lovely
marilyn
pensinger
was
never
seen
again
her
father
however
was
convinced
that
his
daughter
was
not
drowned
but
that
she
had
married
the
man
she
loved
and
returned
with
him
to
his
native
land
hungary
so
great
was
his
faith
in
his
own
theory
that
in
his
will
he
stated
that
the
taxes
on
the
old
pensinger
mansion
should
be
paid
for
one
hundred
years
and
that
it
should
become
the
property
of
any
descendant
of
his
daughter
marilyn
who
could
be
found
within
that
time
i
believe
that
will
was
made
about
years
ago
and
so
you
see
there
are
years
remaining
for
an
heir
to
turn
up
what
will
happen
if
no
one
claims
the
old
place
gloria
inquired
it
is
to
be
sold
and
the
money
devoted
to
charity
miss
selenski
told
them
that
certainly
is
an
interesting
yarn
bobs
declared
then
added
gleefully
i
suppose
the
people
around
here
think
that
the
fair
marilyn
returns
at
midnight
prowling
along
the
shores
of
the
river
looking
for
her
white
silk
shawl
miss
selenski
nodded
that
about
it
i
believe
then
she
added
brightly
i
tell
you
what
i
not
busy
at
this
hour
and
if
you
wish
i
take
you
over
to
see
the
old
place
tenowitz
will
give
me
the
keys
thank
you
miss
selenski
gloria
said
we
would
be
glad
to
have
you
show
us
the
place
there
seems
to
be
nothing
else
around
here
to
rent
and
we
might
remain
in
the
pensinger
mansion
until
you
have
a
model
flat
unoccupied
that
will
not
be
soon
they
were
told
as
there
is
a
long
waiting
list
then
after
hanging
a
sign
on
the
door
which
stated
that
she
would
be
gone
for
half
an
hour
miss
selenski
and
the
three
interested
young
people
went
down
street
and
toward
the
east
river
bobs
was
hilariously
excited
perhaps
after
all
she
was
going
to
have
an
opportunity
to
really
practice
what
she
had
half
in
fun
called
her
chosen
profession
for
was
there
not
a
mystery
to
be
solved
and
an
heir
to
be
found
chapter
a
strange
new
home
lena
may
clasp
on
the
hand
of
her
older
sister
grew
unconsciously
tighter
as
they
passed
a
noisy
tobacco
factory
which
faced
the
east
river
and
loomed
and
huge
the
old
pensinger
mansion
was
just
beyond
set
far
back
on
what
had
once
been
a
beautiful
lawn
reaching
to
the
river
edge
but
which
was
now
hard
ground
with
here
and
there
a
tree
struggling
to
live
without
care
a
wide
road
now
separated
it
from
the
river
which
was
lined
as
far
up
and
down
as
one
could
see
with
wharves
to
which
coal
and
lumber
barges
were
tied
the
house
did
indeed
look
as
though
it
were
a
century
old
the
windows
had
never
been
boarded
up
and
many
of
the
panes
had
been
broken
by
stones
thrown
by
the
most
daring
of
the
street
urchins
though
luckily
few
dared
go
near
enough
to
further
molest
the
place
for
fear
of
stirring
up
the
haunt
a
noble
house
gone
to
decay
gloria
said
she
had
to
speak
louder
than
usual
because
of
the
pounding
and
whirring
of
the
machinery
in
the
neighboring
factory
lena
may
wondered
if
anywhere
in
all
the
world
there
were
still
peaceful
spaces
where
birds
sang
or
where
the
only
sound
was
the
murmuring
of
the
wind
in
the
trees
is
it
never
still
here
she
turned
big
inquiring
eyes
toward
their
guide
never
miss
selenski
told
her
that
is
not
for
more
than
a
minute
at
a
time
between
shifts
for
when
the
day
work
stops
the
night
work
begins
many
of
the
workers
are
women
are
they
not
gloria
was
looking
at
the
windows
of
the
factory
where
many
foreign
women
could
be
seen
standing
at
long
tables
they
leave
their
children
at
the
settlement
house
they
work
on
the
day
shift
and
the
men
if
they
can
be
made
to
work
at
all
go
on
at
night
oh
gloria
this
appealingly
from
the
youngest
will
we
ever
be
able
to
sleep
in
the
midst
of
such
noise
when
we
have
been
used
to
such
silent
nights
at
home
i
do
much
wonder
that
you
ask
bobs
laughingly
exclaimed
as
she
thrust
her
fingers
in
her
ears
for
at
that
moment
a
tug
on
the
river
not
a
stone
throw
away
from
them
rent
the
air
with
a
shrill
blast
of
its
whistle
which
was
repeated
time
and
again
you
wo
mind
the
noises
when
you
get
used
to
them
miss
selenski
told
them
cheerfully
i
lived
on
street
right
under
the
third
avenue
l
and
the
only
time
i
woke
up
was
when
the
trains
stopped
running
the
sudden
stillness
startles
one
i
suppose
lena
may
said
nothing
but
she
was
remembering
what
bobs
had
said
when
they
had
left
the
third
avenue
elevated
now
we
are
to
see
how
the
half
lives
poor
other
half
the
young
girl
thought
i
ought
to
be
willing
to
live
here
for
a
time
and
bring
a
little
of
the
brightness
i
have
known
into
their
lives
for
they
must
be
very
drab
just
wait
here
a
minute
miss
selenski
was
saying
and
i
run
over
to
the
grocery
and
get
the
key
she
was
back
in
an
incredibly
short
time
and
found
the
three
girls
examining
with
great
interest
the
heavy
front
door
which
had
wide
panels
a
shapely
fan
light
over
them
with
beautiful
emerald
glass
panes
on
each
side
i
simply
adore
this
knocker
bobs
declared
jubilantly
hark
hear
the
echoes
the
knocker
was
lifted
and
dropped
again
but
though
they
all
listened
intently
a
sudden
confusion
on
the
river
made
it
impossible
to
hear
aught
else
my
private
opinion
is
that
marilyn
ghost
would
much
prefer
some
other
spot
for
midnight
prowls
bobs
remarked
as
the
old
key
was
being
fitted
into
the
queerly
designed
lock
imagine
a
beautiful
sensitive
girl
of
years
ago
trying
to
prowl
down
there
where
barges
are
tied
to
docks
and
where
derricks
are
emptying
coal
into
waiting
trucks
no
really
romantic
ghost
such
as
i
am
sure
marilyn
pensinger
must
be
would
care
to
prowl
around
here
miss
selenski
smiled
at
bobs
nonsense
i
glad
you
feel
that
way
she
said
for
of
course
if
you
do
believe
in
the
ghost
you
wo
mind
renting
the
house
at
that
moment
the
derrick
of
which
bobs
had
spoken
emptied
a
great
bucket
of
coal
with
a
deafening
roar
and
a
wind
blowing
from
the
river
sent
the
cloud
of
black
dust
hurling
toward
them
quick
duck
inside
bobs
cautioned
as
they
all
leaped
within
and
closed
the
door
with
a
bang
she
then
ejaculated
using
her
favorite
expression
the
man
who
has
this
place
to
rent
ca
advertise
it
as
clean
and
quiet
a
good
place
for
nervous
people
to
recuperate
then
with
a
wry
face
toward
her
older
sister
i
ca
imagine
gwen
in
this
house
can
you
there
was
a
sudden
troubled
expression
in
gloria
eyes
no
dear
i
ca
and
i
wondering
in
fact
i
have
often
been
wondering
this
morning
if
we
ought
not
to
select
some
place
where
gwen
and
little
lena
may
would
be
happier
for
of
course
gwen
keep
on
visiting
her
friends
forever
she
will
have
to
come
home
some
day
the
speaker
felt
a
hand
slip
into
hers
and
glancing
down
she
saw
a
pleading
in
the
uplifted
eyes
of
their
youngest
i
to
live
here
glow
for
a
while
if
you
would
little
puss
that
you
are
gloria
smiled
at
miss
selenski
then
said
may
we
look
over
the
old
house
and
decide
if
we
wish
to
take
it
time
is
passing
and
we
have
much
packing
to
do
if
we
are
to
return
in
another
day
or
two
although
she
did
not
say
so
bobs
and
lena
may
knew
that
their
mothering
sister
was
eager
to
return
to
their
long
island
home
that
she
might
see
gwendolyn
before
her
departure
the
old
colonial
mansion
like
many
others
of
its
kind
had
a
wide
hall
extending
from
the
front
to
the
back
at
the
extreme
rear
was
a
fireplace
with
seats
in
fact
to
the
great
delight
of
bobs
who
quite
adored
them
a
fireplace
was
found
in
each
of
the
big
barren
rooms
four
of
these
were
on
that
floor
with
the
old
kitchen
in
the
basement
and
four
vast
silent
rooms
above
that
had
been
bed
chambers
in
the
long
ago
too
there
was
an
attic
which
they
did
not
visit
when
they
had
returned
to
the
front
hall
bobs
exclaimed
we
might
rent
just
one
floor
of
this
mansion
and
then
have
room
to
spare
but
the
oldest
sister
looked
dubious
i
hardly
think
it
advisable
to
attempt
to
live
in
this
place
she
began
there
is
enough
room
here
to
home
an
orphanage
and
the
kiddies
would
be
crowded
either
roberta
was
plainly
disappointed
oh
i
say
glow
have
you
always
told
us
younger
girls
not
to
make
hasty
conclusions
and
here
you
have
hardly
more
than
crossed
the
threshold
and
you
have
decided
that
we
could
make
the
old
house
livable
now
i
think
this
room
could
be
made
real
cozy
how
the
others
laughed
bobs
what
a
word
to
apply
to
this
old
salon
with
its
huge
chandeliers
and
say
girls
the
irrepressible
interrupted
would
you
like
to
see
all
of
those
crystals
sparkle
when
the
room
is
lighted
then
she
confessed
perhaps
cozy
is
exactly
the
right
word
but
nevertheless
i
like
the
place
and
now
with
the
door
closed
it
is
so
noisy
either
it
keen
take
it
from
me
roberta
gloria
sighed
now
and
then
i
congratulate
myself
that
you
have
actually
reformed
in
your
manner
of
speech
when
say
glow
i
make
a
bargain
bobs
again
interrupted
i
talk
like
the
daughter
of
if
you
take
this
place
now
my
idea
is
that
we
can
just
furnish
up
this
lower
floor
make
one
of
the
back
rooms
into
a
kitchen
and
put
in
gas
and
electricity
and
presto
change
there
you
are
living
in
a
modern
apartment
then
we
could
lock
up
the
basement
and
the
rooms
upstairs
and
forget
they
are
there
if
you
are
permitted
to
forget
miss
selenski
added
with
her
pleasant
smile
then
for
the
first
time
the
girls
remembered
that
the
old
house
was
supposed
to
be
supernaturally
occupied
it
was
bobs
who
exclaimed
well
if
that
poor
girl
marilyn
pensinger
wants
to
come
back
here
now
and
then
and
prowl
about
her
very
own
ancestral
mansion
i
for
one
think
we
would
be
greatly
lacking
in
hospitality
if
we
did
make
her
welcome
then
pleadingly
to
her
older
sister
glow
be
a
sport
take
it
for
a
month
and
give
it
a
lena
may
big
brown
eyes
wonderingly
watched
this
enthusiastic
sister
who
was
but
one
year
her
senior
but
whose
tastes
were
widely
different
her
gentle
heart
was
already
desperately
homesick
for
the
old
place
on
long
island
for
the
gardens
that
were
a
riot
of
flowers
from
spring
until
late
fall
gloria
walked
to
one
of
the
windows
and
looked
out
meditatively
if
this
is
the
only
place
in
the
neighborhood
in
which
we
can
live
she
was
thinking
perhaps
we
would
better
take
it
and
after
all
bobs
may
be
right
this
one
floor
can
be
made
real
homelike
with
the
furniture
that
we
will
bring
and
what
we
do
not
need
can
be
stored
in
the
rooms
overhead
bobs
was
eagerly
awaiting
her
older
sister
decision
and
when
it
was
given
that
hoidenish
girl
leaped
about
the
room
staging
a
sort
of
wild
indian
dance
that
must
have
amazed
the
two
chandeliers
which
had
in
the
long
ago
looked
down
upon
dignified
young
ladies
who
solemnly
danced
the
minuet
and
yet
perhaps
the
lonely
old
house
was
glad
and
proud
to
think
that
it
had
been
chosen
as
a
residence
for
three
girls
and
that
once
again
its
walls
would
reverberate
with
laughter
and
song
we
must
start
for
home
at
once
gloria
said
then
to
miss
selenski
we
will
stop
on
our
way
to
the
elevated
and
tell
tenowitz
that
we
will
take
the
place
for
a
time
and
thank
you
so
much
for
having
helped
us
find
something
we
shall
want
you
to
come
often
to
see
us
bobs
was
the
last
one
to
leave
and
before
she
closed
the
heavy
door
she
peered
back
into
the
musty
dimness
and
called
old
house
we
going
to
have
jolly
good
times
all
of
us
together
chapter
vi
a
lost
sister
two
weeks
later
many
changes
had
taken
place
tenowitz
had
agreed
to
have
one
of
the
two
large
back
rooms
transformed
into
a
modern
kitchen
at
one
end
and
the
other
end
arranged
so
that
it
might
be
used
as
a
in
that
room
the
early
morning
sun
found
its
way
and
when
lena
may
had
filled
the
windows
with
boxes
containing
the
flowering
plants
brought
from
the
home
gardens
it
assumed
a
cheerfulness
that
delighted
the
heart
of
the
little
housekeeper
too
the
huge
chandeliers
in
the
salon
had
been
wired
with
electricity
and
great
was
the
joy
in
the
heart
of
bobs
on
the
night
when
they
were
first
lighted
the
rich
furnishings
from
their
own
were
in
place
and
the
effect
was
far
more
homelike
than
gloria
had
supposed
possible
the
two
large
rooms
on
the
other
side
of
the
wide
dividing
hall
had
been
fitted
up
as
bed
chambers
and
the
furniture
that
they
did
not
need
had
been
stored
in
the
large
room
over
the
kitchen
how
lena
may
had
dreaded
that
first
night
they
had
spent
in
the
old
house
not
because
she
believed
it
to
be
haunted
gloria
had
convinced
her
that
that
could
not
possibly
be
so
but
because
of
the
unusual
noises
she
knew
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
sleep
a
wink
nor
was
she
for
each
time
that
she
fell
into
a
light
slumber
a
shriek
from
some
passing
tug
awakened
her
and
a
dozen
times
at
least
she
seized
her
roommate
exclaiming
glow
what
was
that
sometimes
it
was
a
band
of
hoodlums
passing
or
again
an
early
milk
wagon
or
some
of
the
many
noises
which
accompanied
the
night
activities
of
the
factory
that
was
their
neighbor
it
was
a
very
pale
lena
may
who
set
about
getting
breakfast
the
next
morning
with
gloria
helping
but
bobs
looked
as
refreshed
as
though
she
had
spent
the
night
in
her
own
room
on
long
island
where
the
whippoorwill
was
the
only
disturber
of
the
peace
you
get
used
to
it
soon
that
beaming
maiden
told
lena
may
and
then
when
the
youngest
girl
had
gone
with
a
small
watering
pot
to
attend
to
the
needs
of
her
flower
gardens
at
the
front
of
the
house
bobs
added
softly
glow
how
have
you
planned
things
it
never
would
do
to
leave
lena
may
all
alone
in
the
house
would
it
and
yet
you
and
i
must
go
out
and
earn
our
daily
bread
i
shall
take
lena
may
with
me
wherever
i
go
that
is
i
will
at
first
until
we
have
things
adjusted
the
older
sister
replied
then
she
inquired
what
do
you
intend
to
do
bobsie
or
is
it
a
secret
as
yet
it
sure
is
was
the
laughing
reply
a
secret
from
myself
as
well
as
from
everyone
else
but
i
going
to
start
out
all
alone
into
the
great
city
of
new
york
this
morning
and
give
it
the
once
over
roberta
vandergrift
did
you
promise
me
that
you
would
talk
like
a
johnsonian
if
we
would
rent
this
house
gloria
reprimanded
the
irrepressible
younger
girl
eyes
twinkled
my
revered
sister
she
said
solemnly
my
plans
for
the
day
are
as
yet
veiled
in
mystery
but
with
your
kind
permission
i
will
endeavor
to
discover
in
this
vast
metropolis
some
refined
occupation
the
doing
of
which
will
prove
sufficiently
remunerative
to
enable
me
to
at
least
assist
in
the
recuperation
of
our
fallen
fortunes
then
rising
and
making
a
deep
bow
her
right
hand
on
her
heart
that
mischievous
girl
inquired
miss
vandergrift
shall
i
continue
conversing
in
that
way
during
our
sojourn
in
this
ancient
mansion
or
shall
i
be
just
natural
lena
may
who
had
returned
joined
in
the
laughter
and
begged
do
be
natural
bobs
please
but
not
too
natural
thank
you
mademoiselles
for
your
kind
permission
and
now
i
believe
i
will
don
my
outdoor
apparel
and
go
in
search
of
a
profession
gloria
looked
anxiously
at
the
young
girl
before
her
who
was
of
such
a
splendid
athletic
physique
whose
cheeks
were
ruddy
with
health
and
whose
eyes
were
glowing
with
enthusiasm
ought
she
to
permit
bobs
to
go
alone
into
the
great
surging
mass
of
humanity
so
unprotected
roberta
she
began
do
not
be
too
trusting
dear
remember
that
the
city
is
full
of
dangers
that
lurk
in
places
the
younger
girl
put
both
hands
on
the
shoulders
of
the
oldest
sister
and
looking
steadily
into
her
eyes
she
said
seriously
glow
dear
you
have
taught
us
that
the
greatest
thing
a
parent
can
do
for
her
daughter
is
to
teach
her
to
be
that
she
may
stand
alone
as
sooner
or
later
she
will
have
to
do
i
shall
be
careful
as
i
do
not
wish
to
cause
my
sisters
needless
worry
or
anxiety
but
i
begin
to
live
my
own
life
you
really
wish
me
to
do
this
do
you
not
gloria
yes
dear
was
the
reply
and
i
am
sure
the
love
of
our
mother
will
guide
and
guard
you
and
good
luck
when
bobs
was
gone
lena
may
slipped
up
to
the
older
sister
who
had
remained
seated
and
putting
a
loving
arm
over
the
strong
shoulders
she
said
tenderly
glow
there
are
tears
in
your
eyes
why
do
you
mind
bobs
going
alone
out
into
the
world
i
was
thinking
of
mother
dear
and
wishing
i
could
better
take
her
place
to
you
younger
girls
and
too
i
am
worried
just
a
little
because
gwendolyn
does
not
write
it
was
a
great
sorrow
to
me
pet
to
find
that
she
had
left
without
saying
and
i
ca
help
but
fear
that
i
was
hasty
when
i
told
her
that
she
must
plan
her
life
apart
from
us
if
she
could
not
be
more
harmonious
then
rising
she
added
ah
well
things
will
surely
turn
out
for
the
best
little
girl
come
now
let
us
do
our
bit
of
tidying
and
then
go
over
to
the
settlement
house
and
find
out
what
my
hours
are
to
be
but
all
that
day
try
as
she
might
to
be
cheerful
the
mothering
heart
of
gloria
was
filled
with
anxiety
concerning
her
two
charges
would
all
be
well
with
the
venturous
bobs
and
why
did
gwen
write
chapter
vii
bobs

a
profession
there
was
no
anxiety
in
the
heart
of
roberta
in
her
short
walking
suit
of
blue
tweed
with
a
jaunty
hat
atop
of
her
waving
brown
hair
she
was
walking
a
brisk
pace
down
third
avenue
even
at
that
early
hour
foreign
women
with
shawls
over
their
heads
and
baskets
on
their
arms
were
going
to
market
it
was
a
new
experience
to
roberta
to
be
elbowed
aside
as
though
she
were
not
a
descendant
of
a
long
line
of
aristocratic
vandergrifts
the
fact
that
she
was
among
them
made
her
one
of
them
was
probably
their
reasoning
if
indeed
they
noticed
her
at
all
which
she
doubted
gwen
would
have
drawn
her
skirts
close
fearing
contamination
but
not
so
bobs
she
reveled
in
the
new
experience
feeling
almost
as
though
she
were
abroad
in
bohemia
hungary
or
even
italy
for
the
dominant
nationality
of
the
crowd
changed
noticeably
before
she
had
gone
many
blocks
how
wonderfully
beautiful
were
some
of
the
young
italian
matrons
bobs
thought
their
dark
eyes
shaded
with
long
lashes
their
natural
grace
but
little
concealed
by
shawls
at
one
corner
where
the
traffic
held
her
up
the
girl
turned
and
looked
at
the
store
nearest
her
attention
being
attracted
by
a
spray
of
lilacs
that
stood
within
among
piles
of
dusty
old
books
it
seemed
strange
to
see
that
fragrant
bit
of
springtime
in
a
gloomy
shop
so
far
from
the
country
where
it
might
have
blossomed
as
bobs
gazed
into
the
shop
she
was
suddenly
conscious
of
a
movement
within
and
then
out
of
the
shadows
she
saw
forms
emerging
an
old
man
with
a
long
flowing
beard
and
the
tight
black
skull
cap
so
often
worn
by
elderly
men
of
the
east
side
was
pushing
a
wheeled
chair
in
which
reclined
a
frail
old
woman
evidently
his
wife
in
her
face
there
was
an
expression
of
suffering
patiently
borne
which
touched
the
heart
of
the
young
girl
the
chair
was
placed
close
to
the
window
that
the
invalid
might
look
out
at
the
street
if
she
wished
and
watch
the
panorama
passing
by
instantly
bobs
knew
the
meaning
of
the
lilac
or
thought
that
she
did
and
also
she
at
once
decided
that
she
wished
to
purchase
a
book
and
she
groped
about
in
her
memory
trying
to
recall
a
title
for
which
she
might
inquire
a
detective
story
of
course
that
was
what
she
wanted
since
it
was
to
be
her
chosen
profession
she
could
not
read
too
many
of
them
the
old
man
had
disappeared
by
this
time
but
when
bobs
entered
the
dingy
shop
the
woman
smiled
up
at
her
and
to
roberta
surprise
she
heard
herself
saying
oh
may
i
have
just
one
little
sniff
of
your
lilac
i
adore
them
do
you
the
woman
in
the
chair
nodded
and
her
reply
was
in
broken
english
which
charmed
her
listener
she
said
that
her
good
man
bought
her
a
blossom
by
the
flower
shop
every
day
though
she
did
tell
him
he
should
she
knowing
that
to
do
it
he
had
to
go
without
himself
but
it
the
only
bit
of
brightness
he
can
be
giving
me
my
good
man
says
then
she
was
silent
for
from
a
little
dark
room
at
the
back
of
the
shop
the
old
man
bent
with
years
shuffled
forward
looking
at
him
roberta
knew
at
once
why
he
bought
flowers
and
went
without
to
do
it
for
there
was
infinite
tenderness
in
the
eyes
that
turned
first
of
all
to
the
occupant
of
the
wheeled
chair
then
he
inquired
what
the
customer
might
wish
roberta
knew
that
she
had
a
very
small
sum
in
her
pocket
and
that
as
yet
she
had
not
obtained
work
but
buy
something
she
surely
must
so
she
asked
for
detective
stories
the
old
man
led
her
to
a
musty
dusty
shelf
and
there
she
selected
several
titles
paid
the
small
sum
asked
and
inquired
if
he
would
keep
the
parcel
for
her
until
she
returned
later
in
the
day
then
with
another
bright
word
to
the
little
old
woman
the
girl
was
gone
looking
back
at
the
corner
to
smile
and
nod
and
the
last
thing
that
she
saw
was
the
spray
of
lilacs
that
symbolized
unselfish
love
with
no
definite
destination
in
mind
roberta
crossed
third
avenue
and
walked
as
briskly
as
the
throngs
would
permit
in
the
direction
of
fourth
in
a
mood
half
amused
half
serious
she
began
to
soliloquize
now
miss
roberta
vandergrift
it
is
high
time
that
you
were
attempting
to
obtain
employment
in
this
great
city
suppose
you
go
over
to
fifth
avenue
and
apply
for
a
position
as
sales
girl
in
one
of
the
fine
stores
where
you
used
to
spend
money
so
lavishly
but
when
the
fourth
avenue
corner
was
reached
roberta
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
street
heedless
of
the
seething
traffic
and
stared
at
an
upper
window
where
she
saw
a
sign
that
fascinated
her
burns
fourth
avenue
branch
detective
agency
the
building
was
old
and
dingy
the
stairway
rickety
and
dark
but
roberta
in
the
spirit
of
adventure
climbed
to
the
second
floor
without
a
thought
of
fear
a
moment
later
she
was
obeying
a
message
printed
on
a
card
that
hung
on
the
first
door
in
the
unlighted
hall
which
bade
her
enter
and
be
seated
this
she
did
and
admitted
herself
into
a
small
waiting
room
beyond
which
were
the
private
offices
as
the
black
letters
on
the
frosted
glass
of
a
swinging
door
informed
her
roberta
sat
down
feeling
unreal
as
though
she
were
living
in
a
story
book
she
could
hear
voices
beyond
the
door
one
was
quiet
and
calm
the
other
high
pitched
and
excited
the
latter
was
saying
i
tell
you
i
do
want
no
regular
detective
that
any
crook
could
get
wise
to
i
want
someone
so
sort
of
that
a
thief
would
think
she
would
get
on
to
it
if
he
lifted
something
right
before
her
eyes
it
was
harder
for
roberta
to
hear
the
reply
however
she
believed
that
it
was
but
queerwitz
we
only
have
one
woman
in
our
employ
just
now
and
she
is
engaged
out
of
town
i
the
speaker
paused
and
looked
up
for
surely
the
door
to
his
private
office
had
opened
just
a
bit
nor
was
he
mistaken
for
bobs
as
usual
acting
upon
an
impulse
stood
there
and
was
saying
pardon
me
for
overhearing
your
conversation
i
just
could
help
it
i
came
to
apply
for
a
position
and
i
wondered
if
i
would
do
there
was
a
twinkle
in
her
eyes
as
she
added
i
can
look
real
stupid
if
need
be
the
young
man
in
the
neat
grey
tweed
arose
and
his
expression
was
one
of
appreciative
good
humor
this
is
not
exactly
according
to
hoyle
he
remarked
in
his
pleasant
voice
but
perhaps
under
the
circumstances
it
is
excusable
may
i
know
your
name
and
former
occupation
roberta
did
a
bit
of
quick
mental
gymnastics
she
did
not
wish
to
give
her
real
name
a
vandergrift
in
a
fourth
avenue
detective
agency
even
gloria
might
not
approve
of
that
almost
instantly
and
in
a
voice
that
carried
conviction
at
least
to
the
older
man
the
girl
said
dora
dolittle
were
the
eyes
of
the
younger
man
laughing
the
girl
could
not
tell
for
his
face
was
serious
and
he
continued
in
a
more
manner
miss
dolittle
i
am
james
jewett
may
i
introduce
queerwitz
who
has
a
very
fine
shop
on
fifth
avenue
where
he
sells
antiques
of
great
value
although
he
has
lost
nothing
as
yet
he
reports
that
neighboring
shops
have
been
visited
presumably
by
a
woman
who
departs
with
something
of
value
and
he
wishes
to
be
prepared
by
having
in
his
employ
a
clerk
whose
business
it
shall
be
to
discover
the
possible
thief
are
you
willing
to
undertake
this
bit
of
detective
work
if
at
the
end
of
one
week
you
have
proved
your
ability
in
this
line
i
will
take
you
on
our
staff
as
we
are
often
in
need
of
a
young
lady
it
was
difficult
for
roberta
not
to
shout
for
joy
thank
you
jewett
she
replied
as
demurely
as
a
gladly
pounding
heart
would
permit
shall
i
go
with
queerwitz
now
yes
and
report
to
me
each
morning
at
eight
the
two
departed
although
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
merchant
was
not
entirely
pleased
with
the
arrangement
queerwitz
what
a
name
bobs
was
soliloquizing
as
she
sat
on
the
back
seat
of
the
big
comfortable
limousine
and
now
and
then
glanced
at
her
preoccupied
companion
he
was
very
rich
she
decided
but
not
refined
and
yet
how
strange
that
a
man
with
unrefined
tastes
should
wish
to
sell
rarely
beautiful
things
and
antiques
queerwitz
was
not
communicative
in
fact
he
had
tried
to
protest
at
the
suddenly
made
arrangement
and
had
declared
to
jewett
in
a
brief
moment
when
they
were
alone
that
he
should
pay
a
cent
of
salary
to
that
upstart
of
a
girl
unless
she
did
something
to
really
earn
it
jewett
had
agreed
saying
that
he
would
assume
the
responsibility
but
of
this
roberta
knew
nothing
they
were
soon
riding
down
fifth
avenue
in
the
throng
of
fine
equipages
with
which
she
was
most
familiar
as
often
the
handsome
vandergrift
car
had
been
one
of
the
procession
bobs
felt
that
she
would
have
to
pinch
herself
as
she
followed
her
portly
employer
into
an
exclusive
art
shop
to
be
sure
that
she
was
that
same
roberta
vandergrift
then
she
reminded
herself
that
she
must
entirely
forget
her
own
name
if
she
were
to
be
consistently
dora
dolittle
how
bobs
hoped
that
she
would
be
successful
on
this
her
first
case
that
she
might
be
permanently
engaged
by
that
interesting
looking
young
man
who
called
himself
james
jewett
chapter
viii
a
new
friend
at
that
early
hour
there
were
no
customers
in
the
shop
but
roberta
saw
three
young
women
of
widely
varying
ages
who
were
dusting
and
putting
things
in
order
for
the
business
of
the
day
queerwitz
went
at
once
to
a
tall
spare
woman
of
about
fifty
whose
light
reddish
hair
suggested
that
the
color
had
been
applied
from
without
miss
peerwinkle
he
said
rather
abruptly
here
the
new
clerk
i
was
telling
you
about
you
better
show
her
the
lay
of
things
before
it
gets
busy
miss
peerwinkle
turned
and
her
blue
eyes
seemed
to
look
down
at
roberta
from
the
great
height
where
at
least
she
believed
that
her
position
as
head
saleslady
at
the
queerwitz
antique
shop
had
placed
her
your
name
miss
she
inquired
when
the
proprietor
had
departed
toward
a
rear
door
labeled
no
admittance
bobs
had
been
so
amused
by
all
that
she
had
seen
that
she
hardly
heard
the
inquiry
and
when
at
last
she
did
become
conscious
of
it
for
one
wild
moment
she
could
recall
her
new
name
and
so
she
actually
hesitated
luckily
just
then
one
of
the
girls
called
to
miss
peerwinkle
to
ask
her
about
a
tag
and
in
that
brief
moment
bobs
remembered
when
the
haughty
head
lady
turned
her
coldly
inquiring
eyes
again
toward
the
new
clerk
roberta
was
able
to
calmly
reply
dora
dolittle
miss
peerwinkle
sniffed
perhaps
she
was
thinking
it
a
poor
name
for
an
efficient
clerk
to
possess
bobs
sense
of
humor
almost
made
her
exclaim
i
ought
to
have
chosen
dora
domuch
then
she
laughingly
assured
herself
that
would
have
done
at
all
as
she
did
not
believe
that
there
such
a
name
and
surely
she
heard
of
dolittle
bobs
soliloquy
was
broken
in
upon
by
a
strident
voice
calling
miss
dolittle
you
not
paying
any
attention
to
what
i
am
saying
right
here
and
now
let
me
tell
you
is
permitted
in
this
shop
i
was
telling
you
to
go
with
nell
wiggin
to
the
cloakroom
and
do
be
gone
five
minutes
queerwitz
do
pay
salaries
for
prinking
bobs
was
desperately
afraid
that
she
would
be
able
to
get
through
the
morning
without
laughing
and
yet
there
was
something
tragic
about
the
haughtiness
of
this
poor
miss
peerwinkle
meekly
she
followed
a
thin
pale
girl
of
perhaps
the
two
who
were
left
in
the
shop
at
once
began
to
express
their
indignation
because
a
new
clerk
had
been
brought
in
for
them
to
train
if
ever
anybody
looked
the
greenhorn
it
her
miss
peerwinkle
exclaimed
disdainfully
and
miss
harriet
dingley
agreed
they
said
no
more
for
the
new
clerk
returning
said
what
am
i
to
do
first
unfortunately
roberta
asked
this
of
the
one
nearest
who
happened
to
be
miss
harriet
dingley
that
woman
actually
looked
frightened
as
she
said
nodding
toward
her
companion
do
ask
me
i
not
head
lady
she
is
again
bobs
found
it
hard
not
to
laugh
for
miss
peerwinkle
perceptibly
stiffened
and
her
manner
seemed
to
say
you
evidently
are
used
to
class
if
you
ca
tell
which
folks
are
head
and
which
are
but
what
she
really
said
was
nell
wiggin
will
show
you
around
and
do
be
careful
you
do
knock
anything
over
if
you
do
your
salary
docked
i
be
very
careful
miss
peerwinkle
the
new
clerk
said
but
she
was
thinking
docked
my
salary
docked
i
know
what
it
is
to
dock
a
coal
barge
for
i
have
one
in
front
of
my
home
but
oh
miss
dolittle
please
do
watch
where
you
go
you
almost
ran
into
that
venetian
vase
there
was
real
kindness
and
concern
in
the
voice
of
the
pale
very
young
girl
at
her
side
and
in
that
moment
bobs
knew
that
she
was
going
to
like
her
poor
little
thing
bobs
thought
she
looks
as
though
some
unkind
fate
had
put
out
the
light
that
ought
to
be
shining
in
her
heart
i
wish
that
i
might
find
a
way
to
rekindle
it
very
patiently
miss
nell
wiggin
explained
the
different
departments
in
the
antique
shop
suddenly
she
began
to
cough
and
sent
a
frightened
glance
toward
the
closed
door
that
bore
the
sign
no
admittance
then
stifled
the
sound
in
her
handkerchief
nothing
was
said
but
roberta
understood
the
old
furniture
greatly
interested
bobs
in
her
own
home
there
were
many
beautiful
antiques
casually
she
inquired
how
does
queerwitz
manage
to
obtain
so
much
rare
old
furniture
to
her
surprise
nell
wiggin
looked
quickly
around
to
be
sure
that
no
one
was
near
then
she
said
i
ought
not
to
tell
you
but
i
will
if
keep
it
dark
dark
as
the
deepest
dungeon
roberta
replied
much
puzzled
by
her
comrade
mysterious
manner
the
slight
girl
drew
close
he
makes
it
behind
that
door
that
nobody
allowed
to
go
through
she
said
in
a
low
voice
then
added
evidently
wishing
to
be
fair
but
that
nothing
unusual
lots
of
dealers
make
their
antiques
and
the
public
goes
on
buying
them
knowing
they
may
not
be
as
old
as
the
tags
say
here
now
are
the
old
books
and
at
least
they
are
honest
bobs
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
oh
how
i
do
wish
i
could
have
charge
of
this
department
she
said
i
adore
old
books
there
was
a
light
in
the
pale
face
of
little
miss
wiggin
i
do
too
she
said
that
is
i
love
dickens
i
never
read
much
else
then
almost
wistfully
she
added
i
did
have
much
chance
to
go
to
school
but
once
where
i
went
to
live
i
found
an
old
set
of
dickens
books
that
someone
had
left
and
i
just
read
them
over
and
over
i
never
go
out
nights
and
the
people
living
in
those
books
are
such
a
lot
of
company
for
me
again
bobs
felt
a
yearning
tenderness
for
this
frail
girl
who
was
saying
they
all
the
friends
i
ever
had
i
guess
impulsively
the
new
clerk
exclaimed
i
be
your
friend
if
you
let
me
just
then
a
strident
voice
called
miss
wiggin
forward
you
stay
with
the
books
nell
said
softly
and
i
do
the
china
bobs
watched
the
slight
figure
that
was
hurrying
toward
the
front
and
she
sighed
with
tears
close
to
the
hazel
eyes
and
in
her
heart
was
a
prayer
may
i
be
forgiven
for
the
selfish
heedless
years
i
have
lived
but
perhaps
now
i
can
make
up
for
it
surely
i
shall
try
roberta
had
been
told
by
jewett
that
she
must
not
reveal
to
anyone
her
real
reason
for
being
at
the
antique
shop
and
as
queerwitz
had
no
faith
in
the
girl
ability
to
waylay
a
pilferer
he
did
not
care
to
have
miss
nell
wiggin
devote
more
time
to
teaching
her
the
business
of
selling
antiques
this
information
was
conveyed
by
miss
peerwinkle
to
nell
who
was
told
to
stay
away
from
the
new
clerk
with
the
added
remark
if
she
did
get
on
to
the
ropes
with
one
hour
showing
too
stupid
for
this
business
anyhow
why
the
head
lady
had
taken
such
a
very
evident
dislike
to
her
bobs
could
not
understand
for
surely
she
was
willing
to
do
whatever
she
was
told
ah
well
she
was
going
to
worry
worrying
is
what
makes
one
old
she
thought
as
she
mounted
a
small
on
casters
that
one
could
push
along
the
shelves
from
the
top
of
it
she
examined
the
books
that
were
highest
suddenly
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
delight
then
looked
about
quickly
to
be
sure
that
she
had
not
been
heard
customers
in
the
front
part
of
the
store
occupied
the
attention
of
the
three
clerks
so
roberta
reached
for
a
volume
that
had
attracted
her
attention
it
was
indeed
rare
and
old
so
very
old
that
she
wondered
that
the
covers
did
not
crumble
and
it
had
illumined
letters
perhaps
they
were
made
by
early
monks
bobs
was
thinking
she
sat
down
on
the
ladder
and
began
turning
the
fascinating
pages
that
were
yellow
with
age
suddenly
she
was
conscious
that
someone
stood
near
her
she
looked
up
to
find
the
accusing
gaze
of
the
head
clerk
fixed
upon
her
bobs
was
startled
into
exclaiming
say
miss
peerwinkle
a
cat
has
nothing
on
you
when
it
comes
to
walking
softly
has
it
the
reply
was
frigidly
given
miss
with
emphasis
you
are
supposed
to
dust
the
books
not
read
them
and
what
more
that
particular
book
is
the
rarest
one
in
the
whole
collection
there
a
mate
to
it
somewhere
and
when
queerwitz
finds
it
he
can
sell
the
two
of
them
to
leonel
van
loon
for
one
thousand
dollars
in
cool
cash
roberta
was
properly
impressed
and
replaced
the
book
then
taking
a
duster
she
proceeded
to
tidy
her
department
at
eleven
bobs
wondered
if
she
ought
to
wander
about
the
shop
and
watch
the
occasional
customer
this
she
did
and
was
soon
in
the
neighborhood
of
miss
wiggin
you
to
go
out
to
eat
when
i
do
nell
told
her
i
glad
to
hear
it
was
the
reply
promptly
at
noon
miss
wiggin
beckoned
and
said
come
miss
dolittle
be
as
quick
as
you
can
we
only
have
half
an
hour
nooning
and
every
minute
counts
i
go
around
to
my
room
you
might
buy
something
then
come
with
me
and
eat
it
roberta
could
hardly
believe
what
she
had
heard
only
half
an
hour
to
wash
go
somewhere
eat
your
lunch
and
get
back
why
the
mad
rush
she
exclaimed
does
queerwitz
know
all
eternity
ahead
of
us
a
wan
smile
was
the
only
answer
miss
nell
wiggin
was
not
wasting
time
she
led
the
way
to
the
cloakroom
donned
her
outdoor
garments
and
then
taking
her
new
friend
by
the
hand
she
said
hold
fast
to
me
we
take
a
short
cut
through
the
back
stockroom
it
black
as
soot
in
there
when
it
is
lit
up
queerwitz
wo
let
us
burn
lights
except
for
business
reasons
bobs
found
herself
being
led
through
a
room
so
dark
that
she
could
barely
see
the
two
walls
of
boxes
that
were
piled
high
on
either
side
with
a
narrow
path
between
they
soon
emerged
upon
a
back
alley
where
huge
cans
of
refuse
stood
and
where
trucks
were
continually
passing
up
and
down
or
standing
at
the
back
entrances
of
stores
loading
and
unloading
now
walk
as
fast
as
you
can
little
miss
wiggin
said
as
away
she
went
toward
fourth
avenue
with
roberta
close
behind
her
if
bobs
had
known
what
was
going
to
happen
that
noon
she
would
not
have
left
the
shop
chapter
ix
a
hurried
lunch
fourth
avenue
having
been
reached
miss
wiggin
darted
into
a
corner
delicatessen
store
what
will
you
have
for
your
lunch
she
turned
to
ask
of
her
companion
i
going
to
get
five
cents
worth
of
hot
macaroni
and
a
dill
pickle
double
the
order
bobs
said
and
then
she
added
to
the
man
who
stood
behind
the
counter
i
also
take
two
ham
sandwiches
and
two
chocolate
eclairs
oh
miss
dolittle
is
that
too
much
for
you
to
spend
at
noon
this
anxiously
from
pale
little
miss
wiggin
at
the
vandergrift
table
there
had
always
been
many
courses
with
a
butler
to
serve
and
in
her
heedless
thoughtless
way
bobs
had
supposed
that
everyone
everywhere
had
enough
to
eat
it
was
a
queer
little
smile
that
she
turned
toward
her
new
friend
as
she
replied
this
being
our
first
lunch
together
let
have
a
spread
then
she
paid
the
entire
bill
which
came
to
forty
cents
no
she
assured
the
protesting
nell
wiggin
i
wo
offer
to
treat
every
day
after
this
we
go
dutch
honest
we
will
now
lead
the
way
again
in
the
thronged
street
little
miss
wiggin
turned
with
an
apology
maybe
i
ought
to
asked
you
to
come
to
my
room
probably
used
to
something
better
do
you
believe
it
bobs
replied
cheerily
i
live
in
the
shabbiest
kind
of
a
dump
she
did
not
add
that
she
had
not
as
yet
resided
on
new
york
east
side
for
more
than
hours
at
the
longest
and
that
prior
to
that
her
home
on
long
island
had
been
palatial
she
was
eager
to
know
how
girls
who
had
never
had
a
chance
were
forced
to
live
miss
wiggin
was
descending
rather
rickety
steps
below
the
street
level
is
your
room
in
the
basement
bobs
asked
trying
to
keep
from
her
voice
the
shock
that
this
revelation
brought
to
her
no
wonder
there
were
no
roses
in
the
wan
cheeks
of
little
miss
wiggin
yes
was
the
reply
the
caretakers
of
the
buildings
all
live
in
the
basements
you
know
and
the
janitor
of
this
one
is
a
widow
with
two
little
boys
she
had
a
room
to
rent
cheap
and
so
i
took
it
then
she
led
the
way
through
a
long
narrow
dark
hall
once
bobs
touched
the
wall
and
she
drew
back
shuddering
for
the
stones
were
cold
and
clammy
the
little
room
to
which
bobs
was
admitted
opened
only
on
an
air
shaft
but
there
was
sunlight
entering
its
one
small
window
too
there
were
white
curtains
and
a
geranium
in
bloom
on
the
sill
it
always
pleasantest
at
noon
for
that
the
only
time
that
the
sun
reaches
my
window
the
little
hostess
said
as
she
hurriedly
drew
a
sewing
table
out
from
behind
the
small
cot
bed
unfolded
it
and
placed
the
lunch
thereon
bobs
gaze
wandered
about
the
room
which
was
so
small
that
its
three
pieces
of
furniture
seemed
to
crowd
it
in
one
corner
was
a
bamboo
bookcase
which
held
the
real
treasure
of
miss
wiggin
row
after
row
of
books
in
uniform
dark
red
binding
they
were
all
there
oliver
twist
david
copperfield
old
curiosity
shop
and
the
rest
of
them
nights
it
would
be
sort
of
dismal
sitting
in
here
alone
if
was
for
those
books
the
little
hostess
confessed
that
a
real
good
kerosene
lamp
i
have
it
makes
a
bright
light
i
curl
up
on
the
couch
as
soon
as
my
supper
eaten
and
then
i
forget
where
i
really
am
for
i
go
wherever
the
story
takes
me
come
everything
is
ready
she
added
and
since
fifteen
minutes
of
our
time
is
gone
already
we
better
eat
without
talking
this
they
did
and
gloria
would
have
said
that
they
gulped
their
food
but
what
can
one
do
with
but
half
an
hour
for
nooning
they
did
even
stop
to
put
away
the
table
i
leave
it
ready
for
my
supper
tonight
miss
wiggin
said
as
she
fairly
flew
down
the
dark
damp
basement
hall
five
minutes
later
they
were
entering
the
alley
door
of
the
antique
shop
which
had
so
fine
an
entrance
on
fifth
avenue
may
the
fates
save
us
bobs
exclaimed
i
do
believe
we
are
one
minute
late
are
we
in
for
execution
or
dismissal
but
that
one
minute
had
evidently
escaped
the
watchful
eye
of
miss
peerwinkle
for
when
nell
wiggin
and
roberta
entered
the
shop
they
saw
the
portly
queerwitz
pacing
up
and
down
and
in
tragic
tones
he
was
exclaiming
gone
gone
i
should
have
locked
it
up
but
i
did
think
anyone
else
knew
the
value
of
it
then
wheeling
around
he
demanded
of
bobs
what
good
are
you
anyway
in
the
book
department
one
of
the
rarest
books
i
possess
was
stolen
this
morning
right
beneath
your
very
eyes
and
little
nell
wiggin
usually
so
timid
stepped
forward
and
said
it
must
have
happened
while
we
were
out
at
lunch
it
could
have
been
while
we
were
here
for
nobody
at
all
went
down
to
the
books
queerwitz
paid
no
more
attention
to
the
words
of
little
miss
wiggin
than
he
would
at
that
moment
to
the
buzzing
of
a
fly
dolittle
i
should
say
he
remarked
scathingly
how
roberta
wished
that
she
had
chosen
a
busier
sounding
name
but
the
deed
was
done
one
could
be
changing
one
name
every
few
hours
but
her
revery
was
interrupted
by
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
nothing
was
the
honest
reply
you
are
discharged
came
the
ultimatum
bobs
was
almost
glad
very
well
queerwitz
she
replied
and
turning
she
walked
briskly
toward
the
cloakroom
when
bobs
returned
from
the
cloakroom
having
donned
her
hat
and
jacket
she
was
informed
that
queerwitz
had
just
driven
away
but
that
he
had
said
where
he
was
going
bobs
believed
that
he
was
going
to
report
her
uselessness
as
a
detective
to
her
employer
james
jewett
ah
well
let
him
go
perhaps
after
all
she
had
made
a
mistake
in
her
choice
of
a
profession
as
she
was
passing
she
heard
the
older
women
talking
miss
harriet
dingley
was
saying
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
just
after
the
girls
went
out
to
lunch
i
did
see
a
man
come
in
but
i
thought
he
was
looking
at
china
the
head
lady
shot
a
none
too
pleasant
glance
at
the
other
clerk
as
she
said
coldly
well
you
are
giving
me
any
information
did
i
watch
every
move
he
made
like
a
cat
watches
a
mouse
hole
just
tell
me
that
oh
yes
miss
peerwinkle
i
not
criticizing
anything
you
did
but
you
remember
when
a
boy
ran
by
shouting
fire
we
did
go
to
the
door
to
see
where
the
fire
was
and
a
minute
later
the
man
went
out
and
he
went
the
said
i
know
he
did
now
please
do
think
i
criticizing
you
but
when
he
went
out
i
noticed
that
he
was
a
and
i
certain
that
he
did
have
a
hump
when
he
came
in
we
not
discuss
the
matter
further
was
said
in
a
tone
of
finality
as
miss
peerwinkle
walked
away
with
an
air
of
offended
dignity
bobs
looked
about
for
nell
to
whom
she
wished
to
say
she
was
glad
that
the
youngest
clerk
was
beyond
the
book
shelves
as
roberta
was
curious
to
know
which
book
had
been
taken
a
gap
on
the
top
shelf
told
the
story
it
was
a
rare
old
book
for
which
one
thousand
dollars
had
been
offered
if
its
mate
could
be
found
whoever
has
taken
the
book
has
the
other
volume
i
detective
enough
to
know
that
roberta
declared
then
she
turned
to
find
little
miss
wiggin
standing
at
her
side
looking
as
sad
as
though
something
very
precious
was
being
taken
away
from
her
impulsively
bobs
held
out
both
hands
do
forget
nell
wiggin
that
you
and
i
are
to
be
friends
and
more
next
sunday
morning
at
ten
sharp
i
coming
down
to
get
you
and
take
you
to
my
home
for
dinner
how
would
you
like
that
like
it
the
dark
eyes
in
the
pale
wan
face
were
like
stars
o
miss
dolittle
what
it
will
mean
to
me
miss
harriet
dingley
did
nod
when
she
heard
bobs
singing
out
but
miss
peerwinkle
seemed
to
be
as
deaf
as
a
statue
i
could
laugh
bobs
said
to
herself
as
she
joined
the
throng
on
fifth
avenue
if
my
heart
was
so
full
of
tears
i
do
know
as
i
can
stand
much
more
of
seeing
how
the
other
half
lives
without
having
a
good
cry
over
it
dickens
the
only
friend
and
comforter
of
that
frail
little
mite
of
humanity
then
as
she
turned
again
toward
avenue
a
she
suddenly
remembered
the
package
of
detective
stories
for
which
she
had
promised
to
call
at
the
shop
where
there
was
a
spray
of
lilacs
and
a
invalid
woman
i
guess
i
give
up
the
detective
game
she
thought
as
she
hurried
along
but
i
enjoy
reading
the
stories
just
the
same
half
an
hour
later
she
had
changed
her
mind
and
had
decided
that
she
really
was
a
very
fine
detective
indeed
chapter
bobs
as
bookseller
it
was
three
in
the
afternoon
when
bobs
entered
the
musty
book
shop
on
the
east
side
and
found
the
place
unoccupied
however
the
tinkling
of
a
bell
sounded
in
the
back
room
and
the
little
old
man
shuffled
in
his
expression
was
troubled
and
when
roberta
inquired
for
his
invalid
wife
he
replied
that
she
was
so
well
poor
marlitta
he
said
and
there
was
infinite
tenderness
in
his
voice
she
yearning
to
go
back
to
the
home
country
where
our
children
are
and
their
children
and
the
doctor
thinks
it
might
make
her
strong
once
again
to
be
there
but
the
voyage
costs
money
and
marlitta
would
rather
die
here
than
not
go
honest
the
old
man
seemed
to
be
overcome
with
emotion
then
suddenly
recalling
his
customer
errand
he
shuffled
away
to
procure
the
package
of
detective
stories
for
which
she
had
called
during
his
absence
roberta
went
back
of
the
counter
reached
for
a
book
on
an
upper
shelf
and
while
so
doing
dislodged
several
others
that
tumbled
about
her
revealing
as
though
it
had
been
hidden
in
the
dark
recess
back
of
them
the
rare
book
which
that
morning
had
been
taken
from
the
queerwitz
antique
shop
that
then
was
what
the
old
man
meant
when
he
said
that
his
marlitta
would
not
go
unless
she
could
go
honest
the
girl
quickly
replaced
the
books
and
then
stood
deep
in
thought
what
could
she
do
what
should
she
do
she
knew
that
the
gentle
bookseller
had
taken
the
rare
volume
merely
to
try
to
save
the
life
of
the
one
dearest
to
him
when
he
returned
with
the
package
the
girl
heard
herself
asking
but
you
if
your
marlitta
went
to
the
home
country
would
you
not
be
very
lonely
there
was
infinite
sadness
in
the
faded
eyes
and
yet
too
there
was
something
else
a
light
from
the
soul
that
true
sacrifice
brings
ah
that
i
also
might
go
he
said
then
with
a
gesture
that
included
all
of
the
small
dark
shop
he
added
but
these
old
books
are
all
i
have
and
they
do
not
sell
at
that
moment
roberta
recalled
the
name
of
lionel
van
loon
who
as
miss
peerwinkle
had
assured
her
would
pay
one
thousand
dollars
for
the
rare
book
and
its
mate
for
a
thoughtful
moment
the
girl
gazed
at
the
lilac
then
decided
to
tell
the
little
old
man
all
that
she
knew
at
first
she
regretted
this
decision
when
she
saw
the
frightened
expression
in
his
gentle
face
but
she
hastened
to
assure
him
that
she
only
wanted
to
help
him
and
so
she
was
asking
him
to
send
the
stolen
book
back
to
the
antique
shop
by
mail
when
this
had
been
done
roberta
returning
from
the
corner
post
box
found
the
old
man
gazing
sadly
at
another
volume
which
the
girl
instantly
knew
was
the
prized
mate
of
the
one
she
had
just
mailed
it
no
use
without
the
other
the
bookseller
told
her
and
queerwitz
would
pay
what
it
worth
he
never
does
he
crowds
the
poor
man
to
the
wall
and
then
crushes
him
i
have
a
plan
the
girl
told
him
will
you
trust
me
with
this
book
for
a
little
while
trust
her
who
would
not
for
reply
the
old
man
held
his
treasure
toward
her
heaven
bless
you
was
all
that
he
said
it
was
four
when
bobs
descended
from
a
taxicab
and
mounted
the
steps
of
a
handsome
brown
stone
mansion
on
riverside
drive
van

was
at
home
and
being
a
most
kindly
old
gentleman
and
accustomed
to
receiving
all
manner
of
persons
he
welcomed
roberta
into
his
wonderful
library
listened
courteously
at
first
but
with
growing
interest
when
he
realized
that
this
radiant
girl
had
a
book
to
sell
which
she
believed
to
be
both
rare
and
valuable
the
eyes
of
the
cultured
gentleman
plainly
revealed
his
great
joy
when
he
actually
saw
the
first
volume
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
you
can
not
know
what
it
means
to
me
to
be
able
to
obtain
that
book
i
know
where
i
can
find
its
mate
and
so
i
assure
you
i
will
purchase
it
the
price
being
he
paused
inquiringly
roberta
heard
as
though
it
were
someone
else
speaking
her
own
voice
saying
would
one
thousand
dollars
be
too
much
van
loon
to
a
man
whose
hobby
was
collecting
books
and
who
was
many
times
a
millionaire
it
was
not
too
much
will
you
have
cash
or
a
check
he
inquired
cash
if
you
please
it
was
six
when
bobs
handed
the
money
to
the
overjoyed
bookseller
who
could
not
thank
her
enough
the
little
old
woman
again
was
by
the
window
and
she
smiled
happily
as
she
listened
to
the
words
of
the
girl
that
fairly
tumbled
over
each
other
in
their
eagerness
to
be
spoken
then
reaching
out
a
frail
hand
to
her
good
man
and
looking
at
him
with
a
light
in
her
eyes
that
bobs
would
never
forget
she
said
caleb
now
we
can
both
go
home
to
our
children
roberta
promised
to
return
the
following
day
to
help
them
prepare
for
the
voyage
she
was
turning
away
when
the
little
woman
called
to
her
i
want
you
to
have
my
lilac
she
said
as
she
held
the
blossoming
spray
toward
the
girl
it
was
half
past
six
when
bobs
reached
home
gloria
was
watching
for
her
rather
anxiously
but
it
was
not
until
they
were
gathered
about
the
fireplace
for
the
evening
that
bobs
told
her
story
here
endeth
my
experience
as
a
detective
she
concluded
but
roberta
was
mistaken
chapter
xi
a
queer
gift
true
to
her
promise
roberta
had
gone
on
the
following
afternoon
to
assist
her
new
friends
to
prepare
for
their
voyage
but
to
her
amazement
she
found
that
they
had
departed
but
the
janitress
living
in
the
basement
was
on
the
watch
for
the
girl
and
at
once
she
ascended
the
stone
stairs
and
inquired
are
you
miss
dolittle
bobs
replied
that
she
was
and
the
large
woman
in
a
manner
which
plainly
told
that
she
had
a
message
of
importance
to
convey
whispered
mysteriously
wait
here
down
into
the
well
of
a
stairway
she
disappeared
soon
to
return
with
an
envelope
containing
something
hard
which
felt
as
though
it
might
be
a
key
this
it
proved
to
be
the
writing
in
the
letter
had
been
painstakingly
made
but
the
language
was
not
english
and
bobs
looked
at
it
with
so
frankly
puzzled
an
expression
that
the
woman
who
had
been
standing
near
watching
curiously
asked
can
i
read
it
for
you
strange
things
surely
had
happened
since
the
vandergrifts
had
gone
to
the
east
side
to
live
but
this
was
the
strangest
of
all
it
was
hard
for
roberta
to
believe
that
she
heard
aright
the
old
man
had
written
that
his
entire
stock
was
worth
no
more
than
five
hundred
dollars
and
since
roberta
had
procured
more
than
that
sum
for
him
he
was
making
her
a
gift
of
the
books
that
remained
and
requested
that
she
remove
them
at
once
as
the
rent
on
the
shop
would
expire
the
following
day
the
janitress
with
an
eye
to
business
at
once
said
that
her
son
jacob
was
idle
and
could
truck
the
books
for
the
young
lady
wherever
she
wished
them
to
go
it
was
two
in
the
afternoon
when
this
conversation
took
place
and
at
five
gloria
and
lena
may
returning
from
the
settlement
house
were
amazed
to
see
a
skinny
horse
drawing
a
ash
cart
stopping
at
the
curb
in
front
of
the
pensinger
mansion
the
driver
was
a
hebrew
lad
but
at
his
side
sat
no
less
a
personage
than
roberta
who
beamed
down
upon
her
astonished
sisters
after
a
moment
of
explanation
the
three
girls
assisted
the
boy
jacob
to
cart
all
the
books
to
one
of
the
unoccupied
upper
rooms
and
when
he
had
driven
away
roberta
sank
down
upon
a
kitchen
chair
and
laughed
until
she
declared
that
she
ached
lena
may
busy
setting
the
table
for
supper
merrily
declared
bobs
what
a
girl
you
are
to
have
adventures
here
glow
and
i
have
been
on
the
east
side
just
as
long
as
you
have
and
nothing
unusual
has
happened
to
us
give
it
time
roberta
remarked
as
she
rose
to
wash
her
hands
but
now
i
seem
to
have
had
a
new
profession
thrust
upon
me
glow
how
would
it
do
to
open
an
old
book
shop
out
on
the
front
lawn
i
prophesy
that
these
books
will
fill
a
good
need
some
day
perhaps
when
we
least
expecting
it
was
gloria
reply
then
as
they
sat
eating
their
evening
meal
together
and
watching
the
afterglow
of
the
sunset
on
the
river
that
was
so
near
their
front
door
at
last
bobs
said
do
see
those
throngs
of
poor
women
trooping
from
the
factory
now
they
will
go
to
the
settlement
house
and
get
their
children
go
home
and
cook
and
wash
and
iron
and
darn
and
she
paused
then
added
how
did
we
four
girls
ever
manage
to
live
so
near
all
this
and
know
nothing
about
it
i
feel
as
though
i
had
been
the
most
selfish
useless
here
here
young
lady
i
wo
allow
you
to
call
my
sister
such
hard
names
glow
said
merrily
as
she
rose
to
replenish
their
cups
of
hot
chocolate
then
more
seriously
she
added
as
she
reseated
herself
losing
our
home
seemed
hard
but
i
do
believe
that
we
three
are
glad
that
something
happened
to
make
us
of
greater
use
in
the
world
i
am
lena
may
said
looking
up
brightly
she
was
thinking
of
the
sandpile
at
the
settlement
house
over
which
she
had
presided
that
afternoon
and
gloria
concluded
i
know
that
i
would
be
more
nearly
happy
than
i
have
been
since
our
mother
died
if
only
i
knew
where
gwendolyn
is
and
where
was
gwendolyn
the
proud
selfish
girl
who
had
not
tried
to
make
the
best
of
things
gloria
would
indeed
have
been
troubled
had
she
but
known
chapter
xii
a
young
man
enters
it
was
early
sunday
morning
since
we
are
to
have
your
little
friend
nell
wiggin
to
dinner
today
gloria
remarked
as
the
three
sat
at
breakfast
suppose
we
also
invite
miss
selenski
it
will
be
a
nice
change
for
her
good
bobs
agreed
that
a
splendid
suggestion
now
what
is
the
program
for
the
day
lena
may
has
consented
to
tell
bible
stories
to
the
very
little
children
each
sunday
morning
at
the
settlement
house
gloria
said
and
i
have
asked
a
group
of
the
older
girls
who
are
in
one
of
my
clubs
to
come
over
here
this
afternoon
for
tea
and
a
quiet
hour
around
the
fireplace
i
thought
it
would
be
a
pleasant
change
for
them
and
i
want
you
girls
to
become
acquainted
with
them
so
when
i
mention
their
names
you
will
be
able
to
picture
them
they
really
are
such
bright
attractive
girls
the
settlement
house
is
giving
them
the
only
chance
that
life
has
to
offer
them
then
smiling
lovingly
at
the
youngest
gloria
concluded
lena
may
has
consented
to
pour
and
you
bobs
i
shall
expect
to
provide
much
of
the
entertainment
roberta
laughed
me
she
asked
what
am
i
to
do
o
just
be
natural
gloria
rose
and
began
to
clear
the
table
as
she
added
now
bobs
since
you
have
to
go
after
your
friend
miss
wiggin
lena
may
and
i
will
prepare
the
dinner
we
have
it
planned
but
going
to
surprise
you
with
our
menu
it
was
nine
when
roberta
left
the
pensinger
mansion
it
was
the
first
sunday
that
the
girls
had
spent
on
the
east
side
and
what
a
different
sight
met
the
eyes
of
bobs
when
she
started
down
the
nearly
deserted
street
on
one
side
of
which
were
the
wide
docks
derricks
were
silent
and
the
men
who
lived
on
the
barges
were
dressed
in
whatever
holiday
attire
they
possessed
they
were
seated
some
on
gunwales
others
on
rolls
of
tarred
rope
smoking
and
talking
and
save
for
an
occasional
steamer
loaded
with
folk
from
the
city
who
were
sailing
away
for
a
day
outing
peace
reigned
on
the
waterfront
for
even
the
noise
of
the
factory
was
stilled
turning
the
corner
at
street
roberta
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
boys
playground
was
nearly
deserted
she
had
supposed
that
at
this
hour
it
would
be
thronged
just
as
she
was
puzzling
about
it
a
lad
with
whom
she
had
a
speaking
acquaintance
emerged
from
a
doorway
and
she
hailed
him
you
all
dressed
up
antovich
are
you
just
like
a
regular
little
gentleman
are
you
going
to
sunday
school
oh
no
that
is
i
donno
as
is
hardinian
does
go
to
call
it
that
he
calls
it
a
boys
club
by
treasure
seekers
there
a
clubhouse
over
to
street
i
say
miss
bobs
i
wish
for
you
to
come
and
see
it
i
sure
wish
for
you
to
roberta
assured
the
eager
lad
that
she
might
look
in
a
little
later
then
bidding
him
she
turned
in
to
the
model
tenement
house
to
ask
miss
selenski
to
a
one
dinner
oh
how
lovely
and
sunny
and
sweet
smelling
your
little
home
is
bobs
said
three
minutes
later
when
she
had
been
admitted
to
the
small
apartment
the
front
windows
of
which
overlooked
the
glistening
blue
river
i
like
it
was
the
bright
reply
of
the
slender
girl
who
lived
there
bobs
continued
how
i
wish
the
rich
folk
who
built
this
would
influence
others
to
do
the
same
take
that
rookery
across
the
street
for
instance
it
looks
as
though
a
clap
of
thunder
would
crash
it
to
the
ground
and
it
surely
is
a
fire
trap
it
is
indeed
that
miss
selenski
said
and
though
i
have
reported
it
time
and
again
the
very
rich
man
who
owns
it
finds
it
such
excellent
income
property
that
he
manages
to
evade
an
injunction
to
have
the
place
torn
down
some
day
we
have
a
terrible
tragedy
of
some
kind
over
there
and
then
perhaps
she
paused
and
sighed
but
since
we
help
let
talk
of
pleasanter
things
bobs
then
informed
miss
selenski
that
she
had
come
to
invite
her
to
dinner
that
day
and
the
little
agent
of
the
model
apartments
indeed
was
pleased
and
replied
some
time
soon
i
shall
invite
you
girls
over
here
and
give
you
just
hungarian
dishes
then
bobs
departed
and
as
she
walked
down
fourth
avenue
she
glanced
with
rather
an
amused
expression
up
at
the
windows
of
the
detective
agency
of
which
for
so
brief
a
time
she
had
been
an
employee
she
wondered
what
that
young
man
james
jewett
had
thought
of
her
for
surely
her
recent
employer
would
have
at
once
telephoned
that
as
a
detective
she
had
been
no
good
then
she
decided
that
she
probably
never
would
learn
as
she
most
certainly
would
not
again
return
to
the
agency
but
little
do
we
know
what
fate
holds
in
store
for
us
nell
wiggin
was
ready
and
waiting
and
she
looked
very
sweet
indeed
with
her
corn
yellow
hair
fluffed
beneath
her
neat
blue
hat
her
eyes
eager
her
cheeks
usually
pale
flushed
with
this
unusual
excitement
her
suit
was
neat
and
trim
though
made
of
cheap
material
you
right
on
time
to
the
very
minute
are
you
miss
dolittle
she
said
happily
as
she
opened
the
door
to
admit
her
new
friend
i
sure
am
was
the
bright
reply
i
the
original
on
the
dot
man
or
young
lady
i
should
say
but
while
bobs
was
speaking
there
was
misgivings
in
her
heart
she
had
forgotten
to
ask
gloria
what
she
ought
to
do
about
her
name
should
they
all
be
dolittles
or
vandergrifts
she
decided
to
take
nell
into
her
confidence
and
tell
her
the
story
of
the
assumed
name
the
listener
did
not
seem
at
all
surprised
lots
of
girls
who
go
out
to
work
change
their
names
she
said
it
just
as
honest
as
writing
stories
under
a
different
name
i
should
think
that
so
roberta
agreed
much
relieved
a
is
much
different
and
so
you
are
a
detective
nell
looked
at
her
friend
with
a
little
more
awe
perhaps
heavens
no
not
now
bobs
was
quick
to
protest
i
merely
tried
it
and
failed
well
as
it
turned
out
a
detective
was
needed
on
that
particular
case
nell
was
giving
bob
the
very
information
she
was
eager
to
receive
but
for
which
she
did
not
wish
to
ask
the
next
day
the
stolen
book
came
back
by
mail
roberta
knew
that
she
ought
to
register
astonishment
but
instead
she
laughed
what
did
queerwitz
say
she
inquired
oh
they
all
put
it
down
to
conscience
that
does
happen
you
know
you
read
about
conscience
money
being
returned
every
now
and
then
in
the
newspapers
but
the
strangest
part
was
that
that
very
afternoon
van
loon
came
in
and
said
that
he
had
been
able
to
obtain
the
first
volume
and
wished
to
purchase
the
second
queerwitz
was
out
at
the
time
and
so
miss
peerwinkle
sold
it
to
him
for
five
hundred
dollars
bobs
wanted
to
laugh
again
it
amused
her
to
think
that
she
had
driven
the
better
bargain
but
she
thought
it
unwise
to
appear
too
interested
in
the
transaction
and
so
she
changed
the
subject
and
together
they
walked
up
third
avenue
how
different
it
all
is
on
sunday
nell
wiggin
smiled
happily
at
her
new
friend
she
had
indeed
spoken
truly
the
vendors
carts
were
conspicuous
by
their
absence
and
the
stores
if
they
were
open
seemed
to
be
more
for
the
social
gathering
of
foreign
folk
dressed
in
their
gay
best
than
for
active
business
even
the
elevated
trains
thundered
overhead
with
much
longer
intervals
in
between
and
sometimes
for
as
long
as
fifteen
minutes
the
peace
of
sunday
seemed
to
pervade
that
unlovely
east
side
bobs
noting
a
street
sign
stopped
and
gazed
down
toward
the
river
and
sure
enough
she
saw
a
long
low
building
labeled
club
house
let
go
through
this
way
to
second
bobs
suggested
in
front
of
the
clubhouse
there
was
a
group
of
boys
with
faces
so
clean
that
they
shone
and
one
of
these
leaving
the
others
raced
up
to
the
girls
and
taking
his
friend
by
the
hand
he
said
oh
miss
bobs
you
did
for
to
come
did
you
please
stop
in
by
the
clubhouse
it
will
to
please
mr
hardinian
roberta
smile
seemed
to
convey
consent
and
she
found
herself
being
rapidly
led
toward
a
door
nell
willingly
followed
the
sound
of
band
practice
came
from
within
but
when
the
lad
appeared
with
the
smiling
guest
a
young
man
who
had
been
playing
upon
a
flute
arose
and
at
once
advanced
toward
them
what
dark
beautiful
eyes
he
had
why
roberta
exclaimed
in
surprise
we
saw
hardinian
the
very
first
day
we
came
in
this
neighborhood
to
live
he
was
helping
a
poor
sick
woman
who
had
fallen
and
but
she
could
say
no
more
for
the
small
boy
was
eagerly
telling
the
clubmaster
that
this
was
his
lady
friend
and
that
her
name
was
miss
bobs
the
young
man
smiled
and
said
that
he
was
always
glad
to
have
visitors
what
a
musical
voice
was
bobs
thought
then
turning
to
the
girl
who
had
remained
by
the
open
door
she
held
out
a
hand
this
is
my
friend
nell
wiggin
i
am
sure
that
we
will
both
be
interested
in
knowing
of
your
work
hardinian
if
you
have
time
to
spare
indeed
i
have
always
for
those
who
are
interested
then
the
young
man
told
them
of
his
many
clubs
for
boys
roberta
looked
about
with
interest
why
are
there
so
many
wide
shelves
all
around
the
walls
mr
hardinian
she
asked
at
last
the
young
man
smiled
if
you
will
come
some
night
at
ten
you
will
find
a
little
street
urchin
some
homeless
little
fellow
tucked
up
in
blankets
asleep
on
each
of
those
shelves
as
you
call
their
bunks
maybe
you
do
not
know
but
even
in
the
bitterest
winter
weather
many
small
boys
sleep
out
in
the
streets
or
creep
into
doorways
and
huddle
together
to
keep
warm
that
is
they
used
to
before
i
came
now
they
are
all
welcome
in
here
roberta
wished
she
might
ask
this
wonderful
young
man
where
he
came
from
but
that
would
not
do
on
so
slight
an
acquaintance
and
so
thanking
him
and
bidding
him
good
morning
with
nell
and
antovich
she
again
started
for
home
though
roberta
little
dreamed
it
the
wonderful
young
man
had
come
into
the
drama
of
their
lives
and
was
to
play
a
very
important
part
chapter
xiii
nell
wiggin
story
such
a
merry
dinner
party
as
it
was
in
one
corner
of
the
big
southeast
corner
room
of
the
old
pensinger
mansion
the
young
hostesses
by
neither
word
nor
manner
betrayed
the
fact
that
they
were
used
to
better
things
when
at
last
the
dishes
had
been
washed
and
put
away
a
fire
was
started
on
the
wide
hearth
in
the
long
salon
and
the
girls
gathered
about
it
suppose
we
each
tell
the
story
of
our
lives
gloria
suggested
and
in
that
way
we
may
the
sooner
become
really
acquainted
for
ourselves
a
few
words
will
suffice
we
three
girls
lived
very
happily
in
our
long
island
home
until
our
dear
mother
died
then
last
year
our
beloved
father
was
taken
and
since
then
i
because
i
am
oldest
have
tried
to
be
both
parents
to
my
younger
sisters
and
truly
you
have
succeeded
bobs
put
in
gloria
smiled
lovingly
at
her
hoidenish
sister
who
sat
on
a
low
stool
close
to
the
fire
her
arms
folded
about
her
knees
but
we
soon
found
that
in
reality
the
roof
that
had
sheltered
us
from
childhood
was
not
really
our
own
the
title
it
seems
had
not
been
clear
in
the
very
beginning
when
our
had
purchased
it
and
so
because
of
this
we
had
to
move
i
wanted
to
do
settlement
work
and
that
is
what
i
am
doing
now
lena
may
also
loves
the
work
and
is
soon
to
have
classes
for
the
very
little
boys
and
girls
bobs
as
we
call
this
sister
of
ours
as
yet
i
believe
has
not
definitely
decided
upon
a
profession
roberta
eyes
were
laughing
as
she
glanced
across
at
nell
wiggin
but
since
miss
selenski
did
not
know
the
story
of
her
recent
adventure
nothing
was
said
turning
to
the
slender
agent
of
the
model
tenements
gloria
remarked
will
you
now
tell
us
a
little
about
yourself
miss
selenski
all
through
the
dinner
hour
the
girls
had
noticed
a
happy
light
that
seemed
to
linger
far
back
in
the
nearly
black
orbs
of
the
hungarian
girl
but
they
thought
it
was
her
optimistic
nature
that
gladdened
her
eyes
but
now
in
answer
to
gloria
question
the
dark
pretty
face
became
radiant
as
the
girl
replied
the
past
holds
little
worth
the
telling
but
the
future
i
believe
will
hold
much
oh
miss
selenski
bobs
exclaimed
leaning
forward
eagerly
and
smiling
at
their
hungarian
friend
something
wonderful
is
about
to
happen
in
your
life
i
am
sure
of
that
the
dark
girl
nodded
do
you
want
to
guess
what
it
was
lena
may
who
answered
i
think
you
are
going
to
be
married
she
said
i
am
was
the
joyfully
given
reply
to
a
young
man
from
my
own
country
who
has
a
business
in
the
bronx
nor
is
that
all
he
owns
a
little
home
way
out
by
the
park
and
there
is
a
real
yard
about
it
with
flowers
and
trees
oh
can
you
understand
what
it
will
mean
to
me
to
be
awakened
in
the
morning
by
birds
instead
of
by
the
thundering
noise
of
overhead
trains
miss
selenski
gloria
said
we
are
glad
indeed
that
such
a
happy
future
awaits
you
then
turning
to
little
nell
wiggin
who
sat
back
somewhat
in
the
shadow
though
now
and
then
the
flickering
firelight
changed
her
hair
to
a
halo
of
golden
sheen
she
asked
kindly
is
there
some
bit
of
your
past
that
you
wish
to
tell
us
there
was
something
so
infinitely
sorrowful
in
the
pale
pinched
face
of
little
nell
wiggin
that
instinctively
the
girls
knew
that
the
story
they
would
hear
would
be
sad
nor
were
they
mistaken
nell
wiggin
began
it
is
not
interesting
my
past
and
i
fear
that
it
is
too
sad
for
a
story
but
briefly
i
will
tell
it
my
twin
brother
dean
and
i
were
born
on
a
farm
in
new
england
which
seemed
able
to
produce
but
little
on
its
rocky
soil
and
though
our
father
managed
to
keep
us
alive
he
could
not
pay
off
the
mortgage
and
each
year
he
grew
more
troubled
in
spirit
at
last
he
heard
of
rich
lands
in
the
west
that
might
be
homesteaded
and
so
leaving
us
one
spring
he
set
out
on
foot
for
he
planned
taking
up
a
claim
and
when
he
had
constructed
there
a
shelter
of
some
kind
mother
was
to
sell
the
new
england
farm
pay
off
the
mortgage
and
with
whatever
remained
buy
tickets
that
would
take
us
west
to
my
father
it
was
may
when
he
left
us
he
did
not
expect
to
reach
his
destination
for
many
weeks
as
he
knew
that
he
would
have
to
stop
along
the
way
to
work
for
his
food
dear
little
mother
tried
to
run
the
farm
that
summer
dean
and
i
were
ten
years
of
age
and
though
we
could
do
weeding
and
seeding
we
could
not
help
with
the
heavier
work
and
since
our
mother
was
frail
much
of
this
had
to
be
left
undone
fate
was
against
us
it
would
seem
for
the
rain
was
scarce
and
our
crops
poor
and
the
bitterly
cold
winter
found
us
with
but
little
provisions
in
store
in
all
this
time
we
had
not
heard
from
father
and
after
the
snows
came
we
knew
the
post
office
in
the
town
twenty
miles
away
could
not
be
reached
by
us
until
the
following
spring
and
so
we
could
neither
receive
nor
send
a
letter
our
nearest
neighbor
was
eight
miles
away
and
he
was
but
a
poor
scrabbler
in
the
rocky
soil
a
hermit
of
whom
brother
and
i
had
at
first
been
afraid
because
of
his
long
bushy
beard
perhaps
but
when
we
once
chanced
to
be
near
enough
to
see
his
kind
gray
eyes
we
loved
him
and
knew
that
he
was
a
friend
and
the
future
surely
was
to
prove
this
but
if
possible
that
dear
old
man
eastland
was
poorer
than
we
were
our
mother
we
knew
was
worried
nearly
to
the
point
of
heartbreak
but
i
shall
never
forget
how
wonderful
she
was
that
winter
whenever
we
looked
she
smiled
at
us
tremulously
sometimes
and
when
our
task
of
shelling
and
pounding
corn
was
over
she
helped
us
invent
little
games
and
told
us
beautiful
stories
that
she
made
up
but
for
all
her
outward
cheer
i
now
realize
when
we
children
were
asleep
on
the
mattress
that
had
been
brought
from
the
cold
bedroom
and
placed
on
the
floor
near
the
stove
that
our
mother
spent
many
long
hours
on
her
knees
in
prayer
our
cow
had
been
sold
before
the
snow
came
as
money
had
been
needed
to
pay
on
the
mortgage
and
so
we
had
no
milk
our
few
hens
were
kept
in
a
shed
during
the
day
but
mother
permitted
them
to
roost
behind
the
stove
on
those
bitterly
cold
nights
and
so
occasionally
we
had
eggs
and
a
rare
feast
it
was
but
at
last
our
supply
of
corn
was
nearly
exhausted
there
was
usually
a
thaw
in
january
but
instead
this
exceptionally
cold
winter
brought
a
blizzard
which
continued
day
after
day
burying
our
house
deep
in
snow
at
last
mother
had
to
tell
us
that
unless
a
thaw
came
that
we
might
procure
some
provisions
from
our
neighbors
we
would
have
to
kill
our
three
hens
for
food
what
we
would
do
after
that
she
did
not
say
but
luckily
for
the
feathered
members
of
our
family
the
thaw
did
come
and
with
it
came
eastland
riding
the
eight
miles
on
his
stout
little
mule
and
fastened
to
the
saddle
back
of
him
was
a
bag
of
corn
and
potatoes
dear
kind
man
he
must
have
brought
us
half
of
his
own
remaining
store
eagerly
our
mother
asked
if
there
had
been
news
from
town
but
he
shook
his
head
one
been
through
with
the
mail
wiggin
he
said
then
he
added
likely
you
powerful
consarned
about
that
man
o
yourn
i
you
have
heard
from
him
yet
mis
wiggin
mother
tried
to
answer
but
her
lips
quivered
and
she
had
to
turn
away
so
long
folks
the
old
man
called
be
over
agin
spring
the
snow
permittin
we
children
climbed
on
the
gate
and
stood
as
high
as
we
could
to
watch
our
good
friend
ride
away
what
we
did
not
know
until
later
was
that
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
our
sight
he
turned
and
rode
that
twenty
miles
to
the
village
post
office
a
week
later
mother
was
indeed
surprised
to
see
eastland
returning
and
this
time
he
brought
a
letter
it
was
with
eager
joy
that
mother
leaped
forward
to
take
it
but
it
was
with
a
cry
of
grief
that
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
hurried
into
the
house
the
letter
had
fallen
and
i
picked
it
up
and
glanced
at
it
father
never
got
there
it
said
but
when
he
knew
he
was
going
to
die
he
asked
someone
to
write
he
had
worked
days
and
walked
nights
and
died
of
exposure
and
exhaustion
spring
came
and
with
the
first
balmy
days
our
mother
was
taken
from
us
we
children
were
eleven
years
old
then
and
we
knew
not
what
to
do
must
go
to
eastland
dean
said
would
want
us
to
we
went
and
that
good
man
took
us
in
and
made
a
home
for
us
until
she
paused
and
looked
around
but
as
her
listeners
did
not
speak
she
added
perhaps
this
is
all
too
sad
perhaps
you
will
not
care
to
hear
the
rest
please
do
tell
us
dear
nell
gloria
said
and
so
the
frail
girl
continued
her
story
chapter
xiv
a
pleasant
plan
the
summer
following
our
mother
death
was
hot
and
dry
the
frail
girl
continued
and
the
grass
around
eastland
shack
though
tall
from
early
rains
was
parched
in
august
one
morning
before
he
rode
in
town
our
jokingly
told
my
brother
dean
that
he
would
leave
the
place
in
his
care
ye
let
anything
happen
to
it
sonny
he
said
dean
who
is
always
serious
looked
up
at
the
old
man
on
the
mule
as
he
replied
take
care
of
it
daddy
eastland
even
with
my
life
we
thought
nothing
of
this
my
brother
was
a
dreamer
living
it
sometimes
seemed
in
a
world
of
his
own
creating
i
now
realize
that
my
and
i
did
not
quite
understand
him
it
was
an
intensely
hot
day
how
the
grass
got
on
fire
i
do
not
know
but
about
noon
i
heard
a
cry
from
dean
who
had
been
lying
for
hours
on
the
ground
in
the
shade
of
the
shack
reading
a
book
of
poetry
that
a
traveling
missionary
had
brought
to
him
he
had
visited
us
six
months
before
and
had
promised
the
next
time
he
came
that
he
would
bring
a
book
for
my
brother
when
i
heard
dean
cry
of
alarm
and
saw
him
leap
to
his
feet
and
run
toward
a
swiftly
approaching
column
of
smoke
i
also
ran
but
not
being
as
fleet
of
foot
i
was
soon
far
behind
him
he
had
caught
up
a
burlap
bag
as
he
passed
a
shed
then
on
he
raced
toward
the
fire
i
too
paused
to
get
a
bag
but
when
i
started
on
i
saw
my
brother
suddenly
plunge
forward
and
disappear
he
had
caught
his
foot
in
a
briar
and
had
fallen
into
a
thicket
which
a
moment
later
with
a
crackle
and
roar
leaped
into
flame
his
cap
had
slipped
over
his
face
thank
heaven
and
so
his
truly
beautiful
eyes
and
features
were
spared
but
his
body
was
badly
burned
when
the
fire
had
swept
over
him
the
wind
had
veered
very
suddenly
and
turned
the
flame
back
upon
the
charred
land
and
so
there
being
nothing
left
to
burn
it
was
extinguished
it
was
at
that
moment
that
daddy
eastland
returned
he
lifted
my
unconscious
brother
out
of
the
black
burnt
thicket
and
carried
him
to
the
shack
boy
he
said
and
i
never
will
forget
the
sob
there
was
in
his
voice
did
you
say
ye
take
care
of
the
old
place
with
your
life
was
worth
one
hair
on
yer
head
but
dean
was
not
dead
slowly
so
slowly
he
came
back
to
life
but
his
left
arm
was
burned
to
the
bone
and
his
side
beneath
it
then
because
of
the
pain
his
muscles
tightened
and
he
could
not
move
his
arm
we
were
so
far
from
town
that
perhaps
he
did
not
have
just
the
right
care
once
a
month
a
quack
physician
made
the
rounds
of
those
remote
farms
however
he
did
the
best
that
he
could
and
a
year
later
dean
was
able
to
walk
about
how
like
our
mother
he
was
so
brave
and
cheerful
am
glad
that
it
is
my
left
arm
that
will
not
move
sister
he
often
said
have
a
use
for
my
right
arm
our
noting
how
it
pleased
the
lad
invented
tasks
around
the
farm
that
a
boy
could
do
to
help
but
when
he
was
fourteen
years
of
age
i
discovered
what
he
had
meant
when
he
said
that
he
had
a
use
for
his
right
arm
he
had
a
little
den
of
his
own
in
the
loft
of
the
old
barn
with
a
big
opening
that
overlooked
meadow
lands
a
winding
silver
ribbon
of
a
river
and
distant
hills
and
there
he
spent
hours
every
day
writing
at
last
he
confessed
that
he
was
trying
to
make
verse
like
that
in
his
one
greatly
treasured
book
it
was
his
joy
and
he
had
so
little
that
i
encouraged
him
though
i
could
not
understand
his
poetry
i
am
more
like
our
father
who
was
a
faithful
plodding
farmer
and
dean
is
like
our
mother
who
could
tell
such
wonderful
stories
out
of
her
own
head
at
last
when
i
was
eighteen
years
old
i
told
daddy
eastland
that
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
city
to
earn
my
own
way
and
send
some
money
back
for
dean
how
the
lad
grieved
when
i
left
for
he
said
that
he
was
the
one
who
should
go
out
in
the
world
and
work
for
both
of
us
but
i
told
him
to
keep
on
with
his
writing
and
that
maybe
some
day
he
would
be
able
to
earn
money
with
his
poetry
so
i
came
to
town
and
began
as
an
errand
girl
in
a
big
department
store
now
i
earn
eighteen
dollars
a
week
and
i
send
half
of
it
back
to
the
little
rocky
farm
in
new
england
too
i
send
magazines
and
books
but
now
a
new
problem
has
presented
itself
eastland
has
died
and
dean
is
alone
and
so
i
have
sent
for
him
to
come
and
live
with
me
how
glad
i
shall
be
to
see
him
but
i
dread
having
him
know
where
i
live
he
will
guess
at
once
that
i
chose
a
basement
room
that
i
might
have
money
to
send
to
him
it
was
miss
selenski
who
interrupted
miss
wiggin
she
said
while
you
have
been
talking
i
have
chosen
you
to
be
my
successor
tomorrow
i
am
to
be
married
and
i
promised
the
ladies
who
built
the
model
tenements
that
i
would
find
someone
fitted
to
take
my
place
before
i
left
the
pay
is
better
than
you
are
getting
it
is
dollars
a
week
with
a
sunny
little
apartment
to
live
in
i
want
all
of
you
girls
to
come
to
my
wedding
and
then
when
i
am
gone
miss
wiggin
you
can
move
right
in
and
you
will
be
there
to
welcome
that
wonderful
brother
of
yours
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
a
happier
girl
than
nell
when
she
learned
that
a
brighter
future
awaited
her
than
she
had
dared
to
dream
she
tried
to
thank
her
benefactor
but
her
sensitive
lips
quivered
and
the
girls
knew
that
she
was
so
overcome
with
emotion
that
she
might
cry
and
so
miss
selenski
began
at
once
to
tell
them
about
her
wedding
plans
and
then
soon
after
she
had
finished
the
girls
who
had
been
invited
for
tea
arrived
miss
selenski
knew
many
of
them
and
so
the
conversation
became
general
and
little
nell
wiggin
was
permitted
to
quietly
become
accustomed
to
her
wonderful
good
fortune
before
she
was
again
asked
to
join
in
the
conversation
bobs
walked
with
her
to
the
elevated
and
merry
plans
she
laid
for
the
pleasant
times
the
vandergrifts
were
to
have
with
their
new
neighbors
chapter
xv
the
detective
detected
one
monday
at
high
noon
the
pretty
miss
selenski
was
married
in
the
hungarian
church
and
her
four
new
friends
were
among
the
many
foreign
women
who
came
to
wish
their
kindly
neighbor
much
happiness
in
her
new
life
gloria
had
been
pleased
with
the
earnest
face
of
the
man
who
had
won
the
love
of
little
miss
selenski
and
when
the
smiling
pair
rode
away
on
an
automobile
delivery
truck
which
was
their
very
own
the
vandergrift
girls
with
nell
wiggin
stood
on
a
crowded
street
corner
and
waved
and
nodded
promising
that
very
soon
they
would
visit
the
little
home
with
a
yard
around
it
that
was
out
near
the
woodsy
bronx
park
bobs
at
the
last
moment
had
tied
an
old
shoe
to
the
back
of
the
truck
with
a
white
ribbon
and
there
it
hung
dangling
and
bobbing
in
a
manner
most
festive
while
through
a
small
hole
in
the
sole
of
it
a
stream
of
rice
trickled
but
in
the
thronging
surging
masses
of
east
side
humanity
this
little
drama
was
scarcely
noticed
when
and
cheniska
had
disappeared
up
third
avenue
gloria
turned
to
smile
at
little
nell
wiggin
now
let
us
make
haste
to
get
your
new
apartment
in
order
that
you
may
wire
your
brother
to
come
at
once
that
is
if
a
wire
will
reach
him
yes
indeed
it
will
and
he
is
eagerly
awaiting
it
nell
happily
replied
since
our
death
my
brother
has
been
living
in
town
with
the
missionary
of
whom
i
told
you
the
one
who
used
to
visit
the
remote
farms
and
who
brought
my
brother
years
ago
his
first
book
of
poetry
they
have
been
close
friends
ever
since
but
when
the
girls
reached
the
little
apartment
they
found
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
it
was
in
perfect
order
and
the
thoughtful
bride
had
even
left
part
of
her
wedding
flowers
that
they
might
be
there
to
welcome
the
new
agent
of
the
model
tenements
there
seems
to
be
nothing
to
do
here
beamingly
miss
wiggin
said
perhaps
i
would
better
go
at
once
to
my
room
and
pack
i
will
go
with
you
and
help
bobs
told
her
then
both
of
you
come
to
the
pensinger
mansion
for
lunch
lena
may
suggested
what
did
you
do
about
notifying
mr
queerwitz
bobs
inquired
an
hour
later
as
the
two
girls
started
down
fourth
avenue
toward
the
basement
home
of
nell
wiggin
nothing
as
yet
that
is
i
merely
telephoned
that
i
would
not
be
there
today
i
suppose
i
will
have
to
give
two
weeks
notice
let
us
go
there
at
once
and
i
will
do
so
when
the
two
girls
entered
the
queerwitz
antique
shop
miss
peerwinkle
seemed
to
be
much
excited
because
of
their
arrival
and
hastening
to
the
rear
door
which
was
labeled
no
admittance
she
gave
three
sharp
raps
and
then
hurried
back
and
took
up
her
post
near
the
front
door
as
though
to
prevent
escape
in
that
direction
bobs
looked
all
around
wondering
if
there
was
a
customer
in
the
store
who
was
being
watched
but
she
and
nell
seemed
to
be
the
only
other
occupants
of
the
place
to
add
to
the
mysteriousness
miss
harriet
dingley
upon
receiving
a
nod
from
the
head
lady
walked
to
the
entrance
of
the
cloakroom
deliberately
turned
the
key
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
bobs
always
on
the
alert
noted
all
this
and
marveled
at
it
surely
nell
wiggin
had
done
nothing
to
arouse
the
suspicion
of
queerwitz
then
suddenly
a
very
possible
solution
of
the
mystery
flashed
into
consciousness
undoubtedly
queerwitz
suspected
that
the
late
miss
dolittle
had
something
to
do
with
the
disappearance
reappearance
and
subsequent
sale
of
the
rare
old
book
she
well
knew
how
enraged
the
grasping
shopkeeper
would
be
if
he
learned
that
he
had
received
only
half
as
much
for
the
second
volume
as
had
been
paid
by
van
loon
for
the
first
and
if
that
gentleman
had
described
the
girl
who
had
sold
the
book
to
him
bobs
actually
smiled
as
she
thought
i
guess
i
trapped
all
right
a
fine
detective
i
would
make
when
i
never
even
thought
to
wear
a
disguise
well
the
game
up
she
knew
that
she
ought
to
feel
troubled
when
she
saw
queerwitz
emerge
from
his
secret
sanctum
and
approach
her
looking
about
as
friendly
as
a
thunder
cloud
but
instead
that
irrepressible
girl
felt
amused
as
though
she
were
embarking
upon
another
interesting
adventure
and
she
actually
smiled
to
greet
him
bobs
was
depending
upon
her
natural
to
save
her
from
whatever
avalanche
of
wrath
was
about
to
descend
upon
her
she
had
glanced
beyond
the
man
then
suddenly
she
stared
as
though
amazed
at
what
she
saw
back
of
him
the
shopkeeper
noting
this
turned
and
observed
that
in
his
haste
he
had
neglected
to
latch
the
door
labeled
no
admittance
and
that
a
draught
of
air
had
opened
it
beyond
plainly
were
seen
several
workmen
engaged
in
making
antique
furniture
queerwitz
looked
sharply
at
the
girl
trying
to
learn
if
possible
how
much
of
his
secret
had
been
revealed
to
her
his
anger
increased
when
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
laughing
what
puzzles
me
she
was
saying
innocently
is
how
you
can
make
things
look
as
well
as
whatever
accusations
might
have
been
on
the
lips
of
queerwitz
when
he
approached
roberta
they
were
never
uttered
instead
he
turned
and
walked
rapidly
back
to
his
workshop
and
closed
the
door
none
too
quietly
but
in
a
manner
that
seemed
to
convince
miss
peerwinkle
that
she
and
miss
dingley
need
no
longer
guard
the
entrances
how
bobs
wanted
to
laugh
but
instead
she
walked
over
to
nell
wiggin
who
had
been
collecting
the
few
things
that
she
had
at
the
shop
have
you
given
notice
roberta
inquired
i
wrote
a
note
and
asked
miss
peerwinkle
to
give
it
to
queerwitz
come
let
us
go
half
an
hour
later
nell
wiggin
was
packing
her
few
garments
in
a
suitcase
while
roberta
tied
up
the
precious
books
two
hours
later
the
new
agent
of
the
model
tenements
was
established
in
the
sunny
apartment
and
her
row
of
books
stood
on
one
shelf
of
the
bookcase
now
i
will
wire
my
brother
dean
that
he
may
come
as
soon
as
he
wishes
and
oh
how
i
do
hope
that
will
be
soon
nell
said
as
she
happily
surveyed
the
pleasantest
place
that
she
had
ever
called
home
the
message
was
sent
when
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
pensinger
mansion
for
lunch
i
must
not
remain
long
the
new
agent
told
gloria
for
i
promised
that
i
would
be
on
duty
at
one
every
little
while
during
that
noon
meal
bobs
would
look
up
with
laughing
eyes
at
last
she
told
the
cause
of
her
mirth
i
am
wondering
what
james
jewett
thinks
of
his
assistant
detective
she
remarked
i
am
so
glad
that
i
gave
the
name
miss
dolittle
now
i
can
retire
from
the
profession
without
being
traced
oh
good
here
comes
the
postman
lena
may
declared
as
she
rose
and
went
to
the
side
door
to
meet
the
gloria
looked
up
eagerly
she
was
always
hoping
that
gwendolyn
would
write
the
letters
that
she
had
sent
to
the
newport
home
of
the
schoolmate
whom
gwendolyn
had
said
that
she
was
going
to
visit
had
been
returned
marked
whereabouts
not
known
there
were
two
letters
and
both
were
for
bobs
one
was
a
bulging
missive
from
her
long
island
friend
dick
de
laney
but
it
was
at
the
other
that
the
girl
stared
as
though
in
uncomprehending
amazement
the
cause
of
her
very
evident
astonishment
was
the
printed
return
address
in
the
upper
corner
it
was
fourth
avenue
branch
burns
detective
agency
then
she
glanced
still
puzzled
at
her
own
name
which
was
written
not
typed
miss
roberta
vandergrift
she
read
aloud
then
suddenly
she
laughed
and
looking
up
at
the
other
girls
who
all
interest
were
awaiting
an
explanation
of
her
queer
conduct
she
exclaimed
the
amateur
detective
has
been
detected
but
how
under
the
shining
heavens
did
james
jewett
know
that
my
name
was
miss
dolittle
gloria
smiled
you
have
much
faith
it
would
seem
in
his
ability
as
a
detective
what
has
he
written
bobs
there
were
few
words
in
the
message
miss
vandergrift
please
report
at
this
office
at
once
as
we
have
need
of
your
services
signed
g
jewett
well
i
be
flabbergasted
roberta
ejaculated
but
i
must
confess
i
am
curious
and
so
i
will
immediately
if
not
sooner
hie
me
down
that
way
wait
a
jiff
miss
wiggin
i
walk
along
with
you
when
roberta
and
nell
were
gone
gloria
found
the
bulging
letter
from
bobs
oldest
friend
dick
de
laney
lying
on
the
table
unopened
the
girl
who
was
so
loved
by
that
faithful
lad
had
quite
forgotten
it
in
her
new
interests
gloria
sighed
poor
dick
she
said
to
lena
may
as
she
placed
the
letter
on
a
mantel
i
wish
he
did
not
care
so
much
for
roberta
for
i
fear
that
she
does
not
really
care
for
him
true
it
was
that
at
that
particular
moment
bobs
was
far
more
interested
in
learning
what
jewett
had
to
tell
her
than
in
any
message
that
a
letter
from
dick
might
contain
chapter
xvi
a
new
case
for
bobs
the
outer
office
of
the
fourth
avenue
branch
of
the
burns
detective
agency
was
vacant
when
the
girl
entered
but
almost
instantly
the
door
of
the
inner
office
opened
and
jewett
himself
stood
there
his
pleasant
face
brightened
when
he
saw
his
visitor
advancing
with
his
right
hand
extended
he
exclaimed
miss
vandergrift
i
am
almost
surprised
to
see
you
i
really
feared
that
you
had
deserted
your
new
profession
but
jewett
i
that
is
my
name
i
told
you
that
it
was
miss
dolittle
the
young
man
drew
forward
a
chair
for
her
then
seated
himself
at
his
desk
and
again
roberta
realized
that
although
his
face
was
serious
his
eyes
were
smiling
the
letter
i
sent
to
you
was
addressed
to
miss
roberta
vandergrift
he
said
and
since
you
have
replied
in
person
am
i
not
justified
in
believing
that
to
be
your
real
name
bobs
flushed
i
have
to
acknowledge
that
it
is
she
said
but
the
other
day
when
you
asked
me
my
name
i
did
quite
like
to
give
that
of
our
family
and
so
at
random
i
chose
one
then
the
girl
smiled
frankly
at
him
i
could
have
chosen
a
worse
one
it
seems
miss
dolittle
did
not
impress
my
late
employer
as
being
a
good
name
for
a
clerk
you
are
wrong
there
the
young
man
told
her
and
at
last
there
was
no
mistaking
the
fact
that
he
was
amused
queerwitz
decided
that
you
did
too
much
and
not
too
little
i
do
know
when
i
have
been
so
pleased
as
i
was
over
the
fact
which
so
disturbs
him
that
you
were
able
to
drive
the
better
bargain
queerwitz
has
excelled
in
that
line
and
to
have
a
mere
slip
of
a
girl
obtain
one
thousand
dollars
for
a
book
the
mate
of
which
brought
him
but
five
hundred
dollars
is
humiliating
to
say
the
least
then
leaning
forward
the
young
man
said
with
evident
interest
miss
vandergrift
will
you
tell
me
what
happened
roberta
expression
was
i
understand
jewett
she
replied
that
one
need
not
give
incriminating
evidence
against
oneself
then
her
eyes
twinkled
and
what
is
more
she
told
him
i
believe
that
it
is
necessary
this
office
seems
to
have
ferreted
out
the
facts
you
are
right
the
young
man
confessed
and
now
i
will
tell
you
just
what
happened
it
seems
that
while
you
were
out
for
lunch
queerwitz
or
one
of
his
assistants
discovered
that
the
rare
book
was
missing
he
phoned
me
at
once
and
reported
that
his
head
clerk
believed
that
you
had
taken
the
book
she
had
found
you
so
absorbed
in
it
earlier
in
the
day
that
you
had
not
even
been
conscious
of
her
presence
i
assured
queerwitz
that
i
believed
he
was
on
the
wrong
trail
but
he
insisted
that
a
detective
be
sent
to
watch
your
actions
this
was
done
and
that
night
the
report
delivered
to
this
office
was
that
you
had
visited
an
old
book
shop
on
third
avenue
that
from
there
you
had
mailed
one
book
and
had
then
taken
another
to
van
loon
sold
it
and
had
delivered
the
money
to
the
old
bookseller
our
natural
conclusion
was
that
the
stolen
book
was
the
one
that
you
had
sold
but
when
van
loon
was
reached
by
telephone
he
stated
that
the
first
of
the
volumes
was
the
one
that
he
had
purchased
for
one
thousand
dollars
we
said
nothing
of
all
this
to
queerwitz
as
we
wished
to
see
if
the
book
that
you
had
mailed
was
the
one
that
had
been
taken
from
the
antique
shop
it
was
not
until
the
following
noon
that
the
book
was
delivered
and
almost
immediately
afterward
van
loon
appeared
and
purchased
it
for
five
hundred
dollars
during
the
absence
of
queerwitz
we
were
then
forced
to
conclude
that
the
old
bookseller
on
third
avenue
had
been
the
thief
and
we
sent
at
once
to
his
shop
to
have
him
arrested
only
to
discover
that
with
his
wife
marlitta
he
had
sailed
for
europe
at
daybreak
however
our
detective
reported
that
miss
dolittle
was
at
the
shop
having
all
of
the
old
books
heaped
upon
a
cart
being
truly
puzzled
by
the
case
i
decided
to
follow
it
up
myself
which
i
did
reaching
the
place
in
my
closed
car
just
as
you
were
being
driven
away
on
the
truck
i
followed
unobserved
and
when
you
descended
in
front
of
the
pensinger
mansion
with
which
place
i
am
familiar
i
decided
that
you
lived
there
to
verify
this
i
visited
the
grocer
who
has
charge
of
the
place
i
made
a
few
purchases
and
then
said
casually
to
the
grocer
see
the
old
pensinger
mansion
is
occupied
people
been
there
long
tenowitz
as
i
hoped
was
garrulous
and
told
me
all
he
knew
about
the
three
vandergrift
girls
who
had
taken
possession
of
the
place
he
said
the
one
answering
to
your
description
was
called
roberta
of
course
the
grocer
really
knew
little
about
you
but
it
was
not
hard
for
a
detective
to
learn
much
more
about
a
family
that
for
generations
has
been
so
well
known
in
new
york
but
there
is
one
thing
i
do
not
understand
and
that
is
your
evident
interest
in
that
old
dealer
in
books
i
will
tell
you
gladly
roberta
said
and
she
recounted
the
story
from
the
moment
when
she
had
caught
a
first
glimpse
of
the
spray
of
lilacs
unconsciously
telling
him
more
than
her
words
did
of
how
touched
her
heart
was
by
the
poverty
and
sorrow
that
she
was
seeing
for
the
first
time
when
she
paused
he
looked
thoughtfully
out
of
the
window
i
do
know
that
i
ought
to
permit
you
to
continue
in
this
line
of
work
he
said
a
girl
brought
up
as
you
have
been
can
know
nothing
really
of
the
dangers
that
lurk
everywhere
in
this
great
city
oh
mr
jewett
bobs
was
eager
please
let
me
try
just
once
more
then
if
i
fail
again
i
will
endeavor
to
find
a
profession
for
which
i
am
better
fitted
very
well
i
will
was
the
smiling
reply
for
this
case
can
not
lead
you
into
places
that
might
be
unwise
for
you
to
visit
in
fact
i
am
sure
that
it
is
a
case
that
will
greatly
interest
a
young
girl
jewett
paused
to
take
a
note
book
from
his
pocket
while
he
was
scanning
the
pages
roberta
leaned
forward
waiting
almost
breathlessly
eager
jewett
glancing
up
from
his
note
book
smiled
to
see
bobs
eager
interested
expression
then
he
told
her
about
the
case
a
certain
who
is
prominent
in
society
has
a
daughter
who
although
brought
up
in
a
convent
is
determined
to
go
upon
the
stage
her
mother
has
tried
every
form
of
persuasion
to
prevent
this
unfortunate
step
and
at
last
she
decided
that
a
year
of
travel
in
europe
might
have
the
desired
effect
and
so
she
engaged
passage
upon
a
steamer
which
is
to
sail
next
week
believed
that
if
she
could
interest
the
girl
in
other
things
just
now
on
their
return
to
this
country
she
might
entirely
abandon
her
determination
to
become
a
chorus
girl
the
mother
assured
me
that
winnie
her
daughter
is
not
talented
enough
to
advance
beyond
that
point
but
the
girl
it
would
seem
has
more
determination
and
than
she
has
talent
for
when
her
mother
informed
her
of
the
plans
she
had
made
although
outwardly
seeming
to
acquiesce
she
was
inwardly
rebellious
as
her
subsequent
actions
proved
for
that
night
she
disappeared
three
days
have
passed
and
she
has
not
returned
did
not
report
the
matter
at
once
believing
that
winnie
must
have
gone
to
stay
with
girl
friends
in
the
suburbs
but
yesterday
having
inquired
at
all
possible
places
where
her
daughter
might
visit
without
having
found
a
trace
of
her
whereabouts
in
desperation
appealed
to
us
imploring
us
forever
to
keep
the
matter
secret
we
of
course
agreed
to
do
this
and
it
was
then
that
i
determined
to
send
for
you
believing
that
a
young
girl
could
find
winnie
sooner
than
one
of
our
men
do
you
think
jewett
that
the
daughter
of
has
joined
a
theatrical
troupe
in
this
city
bobs
inquired
i
think
that
it
is
more
possible
that
she
has
joined
a
troupe
that
either
has
or
soon
will
leave
town
to
tour
the
country
but
of
course
we
must
first
visit
the
playhouses
in
the
city
i
have
two
other
women
working
on
the
case
as
i
wish
if
possible
to
cover
all
of
the
theaters
today
i
have
assigned
to
you
a
group
of
broadway
playhouses
that
you
can
easily
visit
during
the
matinee
performances
here
is
a
photograph
of
the
missing
girl
roberta
looked
at
the
pictured
face
how
lovely
she
is
was
her
comment
i
do
not
wonder
that
her
mother
wants
to
protect
her
how
i
do
hope
that
i
will
be
able
to
find
winnie
and
persuade
her
to
wait
at
least
until
she
is
eighteen
years
of
age
before
choosing
a
profession
the
girl
rose
it
is
she
said
perhaps
i
had
better
be
starting
do
i
have
to
have
a
pass
or
something
of
that
sort
in
order
to
be
admitted
to
the
theaters
jewett
also
rose
and
pinned
a
badge
under
the
lapel
of
the
jacket
show
that
he
told
her
and
it
will
be
all
the
pass
that
you
will
need
then
as
he
held
open
the
door
he
smilingly
added
good
luck
to
you
miss
dolittle
vandergrift
bobs
flashed
a
merry
smile
back
at
the
young
man
i
sincerely
hope
that
i
will
do
more
than
i
did
last
time
she
said
but
when
she
was
seated
in
the
taxi
which
was
to
take
her
to
her
destination
on
broadway
her
thoughts
were
not
of
the
little
actress
but
of
gwendolyn
day
after
day
roberta
had
noted
that
try
as
she
might
to
be
cheerful
her
oldest
sister
the
one
who
had
been
mother
to
them
all
grew
sadder
and
more
troubled
glow
will
not
be
really
happy
bobs
was
thinking
until
gwen
comes
back
to
us
i
can
not
see
where
she
can
be
for
she
had
only
one
allowance
with
her
and
she
could
not
live
long
on
that
bobs
reverie
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
stopping
of
the
taxi
and
looking
up
the
girl
found
that
they
were
in
front
of
one
of
the
festively
adorned
theaters
with
a
rapidly
beating
heart
she
descended
to
the
walk
made
her
way
through
the
throng
showed
her
badge
and
was
admitted
at
her
request
an
usher
led
her
behind
the
scenes
bobs
felt
as
though
she
were
on
the
brink
of
some
momentous
discovery
chapter
xvii
bobs
tries
acting
when
they
were
behind
the
scenes
a
short
flashily
attired
man
advanced
to
meet
roberta
and
the
usher
departed
for
one
panicky
moment
bobs
wondered
whether
she
should
tell
that
she
was
a
detective
would
the
director
wish
her
to
interfere
with
his
plans
as
she
undoubtedly
would
be
doing
were
she
to
take
from
him
one
of
his
chorus
girls
the
alert
little
man
however
did
not
need
to
be
told
for
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
roberta
badge
when
a
projecting
bit
of
scenery
had
for
a
moment
pulled
at
her
coat
rubbing
his
hands
and
smiling
ingratiatingly
he
said
in
a
voice
of
oily
smoothness
is
it
one
of
our
girls
that
you
wishing
to
see
bob
realized
that
he
had
guessed
her
mission
and
so
she
thought
best
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
him
and
tell
the
whole
story
the
little
man
seemed
greatly
relieved
and
shook
his
head
many
times
as
he
talked
no
such
girl
here
he
assured
her
i
turn
her
over
to
her
ma
if
there
was
come
and
see
the
small
man
spun
around
with
the
suddenness
of
a
top
and
bobs
could
not
help
thinking
that
his
build
suggested
the
shape
of
that
toy
then
he
darted
away
dodging
the
painted
trees
with
great
dexterity
leading
the
way
down
dark
aisles
among
the
scenes
that
were
not
to
be
used
that
day
at
last
they
reached
the
dressing
rooms
look
in
all
of
he
said
do
knock
just
walk
in
then
with
a
flourish
of
his
plump
hands
which
seemed
to
bestow
upon
her
the
freedom
of
the
place
the
small
man
gave
another
of
his
spins
and
disappeared
among
the
scenery
roberta
found
herself
standing
near
a
door
on
which
was
a
large
gilt
star
no
need
to
go
in
there
she
decided
for
of
course
the
girl
whom
she
sought
would
not
be
the
company
star
but
since
she
had
the
open
sesame
of
all
the
rooms
why
not
enter
she
had
always
been
wild
to
go
behind
the
scenes
when
she
and
her
sisters
had
been
seated
in
a
box
in
this
very
theater
little
had
she
dreamed
in
those
days
that
now
seemed
so
far
in
the
past
that
day
would
come
when
she
would
be
behind
the
scenes
in
the
role
of
an
amateur
detective
as
roberta
stood
gazing
at
the
closed
door
she
saw
it
open
and
a
maid
dressed
trimly
in
black
and
white
hurried
out
leaving
the
door
ajar
glancing
in
bobs
saw
a
truly
beautiful
young
woman
lounging
in
a
comfortable
chair
in
front
of
a
long
mirror
the
maid
had
evidently
been
arranging
her
hair
several
elaborate
gowns
were
hanging
about
the
room
suddenly
roberta
flushed
for
she
realized
that
a
pair
of
darkly
lashed
eyes
were
observing
her
in
the
mirror
then
the
beautiful
face
smiled
and
a
slim
white
hand
beckoned
entering
the
small
dressing
room
roberta
also
smiled
into
the
mirror
forgive
me
for
gazing
so
rudely
she
apologized
but
all
my
life
i
have
wished
that
i
might
meet
a
real
star
the
young
woman
turned
and
with
a
graceful
yet
indolent
gesture
bade
roberta
be
seated
on
a
low
chair
that
was
facing
her
do
was
all
that
she
said
and
the
visitor
thought
that
even
that
harsh
word
was
like
music
so
deep
and
rich
was
the
voice
that
uttered
it
bobs
was
puzzled
she
looked
up
inquiringly
do
what
she
asked
the
white
hand
rested
on
roberta
knee
as
the
voice
continued
kindly
if
you
were
my
sister
i
would
say
do
take
up
the
stage
as
a
profession
it
such
a
weary
thankless
life
only
a
few
of
us
reach
the
top
little
girl
and
it
such
a
hard
grind
too
if
you
want
to
live
right
theatrical
folk
think
you
are
queer
and
you
do
win
their
friendship
they
say
you
not
their
kind
but
you
roberta
breathed
with
very
evident
admiration
you
are
a
star
you
do
not
need
their
friendship
she
was
thinking
of
the
small
florid
man
who
had
suggested
a
top
the
actress
smiled
and
then
hurriedly
added
in
a
low
voice
for
the
maid
was
returning
i
have
time
to
talk
more
now
but
dear
girl
even
as
a
star
i
say
bobs
impulsively
caught
the
frail
hand
and
held
it
in
a
close
clasp
she
wondered
why
there
were
tears
in
the
eyes
as
she
was
closing
the
door
after
her
she
heard
the
maid
address
the
star
as
miss
merryheart
another
fictitious
name
that
does
fit
bobs
thought
how
she
longed
to
go
back
to
the
little
dressing
room
and
ask
miss
merryheart
if
there
was
something
anything
she
could
do
for
her
but
instead
with
a
half
sigh
she
turned
toward
an
open
door
beyond
which
she
could
hear
laughter
and
joking
bobs
wondered
if
among
those
chorus
girls
she
would
find
the
one
she
sought
the
door
to
the
larger
room
was
ajar
and
roberta
entered
as
she
had
guessed
there
was
a
bevy
of
girls
in
the
room
a
dozen
mirrors
lined
the
walls
and
before
each
of
them
stood
a
young
girl
applying
paint
or
powder
to
her
face
or
adjusting
a
wig
with
long
golden
curls
some
of
them
were
dressed
in
spangly
tights
and
others
in
very
short
skirts
that
stood
out
stiffly
this
was
unmistakably
the
chorus
hello
sweetie
a
buxom
maiden
near
the
door
sang
out
when
she
observed
the
newcomer
what
line
of
talk
are
you
goin
to
give
us
the
last
guy
as
was
here
asked
us
if
our
souls
was
saved
is
that
the
dope
you
got
up
your
sleeve
roberta
smiled
so
frankly
that
she
seemed
to
disarm
their
fears
that
they
were
to
be
preached
to
i
say
she
began
as
she
sat
on
a
trunk
near
the
door
do
you
all
like
this
life
another
girl
whirled
about
and
pausing
in
the
process
of
applying
a
lip
stick
she
winked
wisely
at
the
one
who
had
first
spoken
say
pink
she
called
i
spotted
she
an
for
some
daily
wrong
you
are
bobs
merrily
replied
then
she
turned
to
a
slender
girl
who
was
standing
at
the
mirror
next
to
her
who
had
appeared
quite
indifferent
to
the
newcomer
presence
how
is
it
with
you
roberta
asked
her
directly
do
you
like
this
life
but
it
was
one
of
the
bolder
girls
who
replied
sure
thing
we
all
like
the
life
it
great
goin
to
join
the
high
kicks
this
question
was
asked
by
still
another
girl
who
having
completed
her
toilet
now
sauntered
up
and
stood
directly
in
front
of
bobs
for
one
moment
the
young
detective
heart
beat
rapidly
for
the
newcomer
resemblance
to
the
picture
was
striking
but
another
girl
was
saying
bee
there
has
been
with
this
here
show
for
two
years
and
she
likes
the
life
do
you
bee
so
after
all
this
was
the
one
whom
she
sought
bobs
decided
to
take
them
into
her
confidence
smiling
around
in
the
winning
way
that
she
had
she
began
girls
you
had
three
guesses
and
missed
so
now
i
put
you
wise
i
looking
for
a
winifred
whose
wishes
to
see
her
at
once
if
not
sooner
can
you
tell
me
at
which
theater
i
can
find
her
the
others
grouped
about
roberta
but
all
shook
their
heads
dunno
as
i
squeal
on
her
if
i
did
know
said
the
one
called
pink
but
as
it
happens
i
do
nor
did
the
others
it
would
seem
and
when
roberta
was
convinced
that
winnie
was
not
to
be
found
there
she
left
but
as
the
curtain
had
raised
on
the
first
scene
she
paused
near
the
front
door
to
hear
miss
merryheart
sing
truly
she
was
an
actress
bobs
thought
for
no
one
in
that
vast
audience
who
saw
the
star
could
have
guessed
that
only
a
brief
time
before
there
had
been
tears
in
those
eyes
that
now
seemed
to
be
brimming
with
mirth
at
the
next
theater
she
entered
bobs
had
an
unexpected
and
rather
startling
experience
just
as
she
appeared
in
the
dimly
lighted
space
back
of
the
scenes
she
was
pounced
upon
by
a
man
who
was
undoubtedly
the
stage
manager
miss
finefeather
he
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
what
you
late
again
two
minutes
only
to
get
into
your
riggin
then
giving
bobs
a
shove
toward
an
open
door
he
called
hoarsely
here
that
laggard
stella
help
her
and
be
quick
we
do
want
any
hitches
in
this
scene
no
time
for
explainin
that
an
settlin
accounts
will
come
later
he
added
when
bobs
tried
to
turn
back
to
explain
that
she
was
miss
finefeather
the
man
was
gone
and
the
leading
chorus
girl
pounced
upon
her
and
with
the
aid
of
two
others
she
was
being
disrobed
to
her
amusement
as
well
as
amazement
she
soon
found
herself
arrayed
in
tights
with
a
short
spangled
overskirt
resignedly
she
decided
to
see
it
through
just
at
that
moment
a
buzzer
sounded
which
seemed
to
be
a
signal
for
the
entrance
of
the
chorus
here
you
miss
finefeather
someone
was
saying
ca
you
remember
overnight
where
your
place
is
just
back
of
me
and
do
everything
i
do
and
you
get
through
all
right
the
voice
was
evidently
intended
to
be
kind
bobs
followed
the
one
ahead
trying
to
suppress
an
almost
uncontrollable
desire
to
laugh
who
in
the
world
did
they
suppose
her
to
be
she
wondered
the
girls
had
divided
into
two
long
lines
and
they
entered
the
stage
from
opposite
sides
bobs
was
thinking
i
heard
folk
say
hard
to
get
on
the
stage
strikes
me
it
just
the
other
way
i
jolly
wish
though
i
had
some
idea
what
i
supposed
to
do
roberta
reverie
was
interrupted
by
her
kindly
neighbor
who
whispered
gim
me
your
paw
here
where
we
swing
an
do
forget
to
keep
your
feet
going
all
the
time
there
no
standing
still
in
this
act
being
in
it
bobs
decided
to
try
to
do
her
best
and
having
been
a
champion
in
school
athletics
she
was
limber
and
mentally
alert
and
went
through
the
skipping
and
whirling
and
various
gyrations
almost
as
well
as
though
she
had
been
trained
however
when
the
act
was
finished
and
the
chorus
girls
with
a
burst
of
singing
laughter
had
run
from
the
stage
the
man
whom
she
had
first
seen
came
up
to
her
profuse
with
apologies
he
had
just
received
a
message
telling
him
that
miss
finefeather
was
very
ill
and
would
be
able
to
keep
on
with
the
work
you
a
wonder
he
exclaimed
with
very
sincere
admiration
how
you
went
through
that
act
and
never
missed
so
one
could
notice
it
proves
you
the
girl
for
the
place
say
you
like
it
and
the
position
yours
bobs
paused
but
in
that
moment
she
seemed
to
hear
miss
merryheart
one
word
do
roberta
thanked
the
man
but
said
that
her
business
engagements
for
that
afternoon
were
so
urgent
that
she
could
not
even
remain
for
another
act
having
learned
that
miss
finefeather
had
been
with
them
but
a
few
days
bobs
believing
that
she
might
be
the
girl
whom
she
sought
asked
for
her
address
and
departed
her
heart
was
filled
with
hope
i
believe
i
hit
the
right
trail
she
thought
as
she
hurried
out
of
the
theater
chapter
xviii
who
was
miss
finefeather
roberta
stepped
into
a
drug
store
to
inquire
the
way
to
the
address
that
she
had
upon
a
slip
of
brown
paper
the
clerk
happened
to
know
the
locality
without
referring
to
the
directory
and
bobs
was
thanking
him
when
one
of
the
customers
exclaimed
in
a
voice
that
plainly
expressed
the
speaker
great
joy
bobsy
vandergrift
of
all
people
where
in
the
world
are
you
girls
living
dick
wrote
me
that
you
had
left
long
island
but
he
failed
to
tell
me
where
you
had
located
it
was
kathryn
de
laney
who
as
she
talked
drew
bobs
into
a
quiet
booth
the
girls
seated
themselves
and
clasped
hands
across
the
table
oh
kathy
bobs
said
her
eyes
glowing
with
the
real
pleasure
that
she
felt
i
been
meaning
to
look
you
up
for
gloria
sake
if
for
no
other
reason
i
heard
glow
say
only
the
other
day
that
she
wanted
to
see
you
i
believe
you
do
her
worlds
of
good
you
so
breezy
and
cheerful
kathryn
looked
troubled
why
is
anything
especially
wrong
with
glow
she
brooding
because
gwen
does
write
bobs
said
then
she
told
briefly
all
that
had
happened
how
gwen
had
refused
to
come
with
the
others
to
try
to
earn
her
living
and
how
instead
she
had
departed
without
saying
to
them
to
visit
her
school
friend
eloise
rochester
and
how
letters
sent
there
by
gloria
had
been
returned
marked
whereabouts
unknown
i
honestly
believe
that
gloria
thinks
of
nothing
else
i
watched
her
when
she
was
pretending
to
read
and
she
does
turn
a
page
by
the
hour
i
had
just
about
made
up
my
mind
to
put
an
advertisement
of
some
kind
in
the
paper
not
that
i
crazy
about
gwen
myself
there
no
excuse
for
one
sister
being
so
superlatively
selfish
and
disagreeable
as
she
is
but
gloria
believes
she
honestly
does
that
if
we
are
patient
and
loving
gwen
will
change
in
time
because
after
all
she
is
our
daughter
gloria
is
right
was
the
quiet
answer
i
am
sure
of
that
you
all
helped
to
spoil
gwen
when
she
was
a
child
because
she
was
frail
then
later
you
let
her
have
her
own
way
because
you
dreaded
her
temper
spells
but
i
honestly
believe
that
a
few
hard
knocks
will
do
much
toward
readjusting
gwendolyn
outlook
upon
life
but
kathryn
bobs
exclaimed
do
you
know
that
gwen
could
stand
hard
knocks
if
it
were
a
case
of
sink
or
swim
gwen
would
just
give
up
and
sink
i
not
so
sure
the
girl
who
had
been
next
door
neighbor
to
the
vandergrifts
all
her
life
replied
it
an
instinct
with
all
of
us
to
at
least
try
to
keep
our
heads
above
water
then
she
added
but
did
i
hear
you
asking
the
clerk
about
an
address
that
was
what
first
attracted
my
attention
to
you
because
it
is
the
same
locality
as
my
destination
i
visiting
nurse
now
on
the
lower
west
side
then
after
glancing
at
the
slip
of
paper
bobs
held
up
kathryn
continued
i
call
a
taxi
and
while
we
are
riding
down
there
you
can
tell
me
all
about
yourself
when
they
were
settled
for
the
long
ride
bobs
blurted
out
say
kathy
before
i
begin
please
tell
me
why
you
taken
up
nursing
a
girl
with
a
thousand
dollars
a
month
income
hardly
needs
the
salary
derived
from
such
service
and
of
course
i
know
that
you
take
none
phyl
said
she
thought
you
ought
to
be
examined
by
a
lunacy
board
kathryn
laughed
as
she
replied
oh
phyl
means
all
right
she
does
think
i
crazy
but
honestly
bobsy
anyone
who
lives
the
idle
selfish
butterfly
life
that
phyllis
does
is
worse
than
not
sane
i
think
but
she
will
wake
up
as
gwen
will
some
day
and
see
the
worthlessness
of
it
all
now
tell
me
about
yourself
why
are
you
bound
for
the
lower
west
side
bobs
told
her
story
how
kathryn
laughed
a
vandergrift
a
detective
she
exclaimed
what
would
that
stately
old
grandfather
of
yours
have
to
say
if
he
knew
it
roberta
eyes
twinkled
just
about
the
same
thing
that
he
would
say
about
aircraft
or
radio
impossible
the
recounting
of
their
recent
experiences
had
occupied
so
much
time
that
as
its
conclusion
was
reached
so
too
was
bobs
destination
i
get
out
with
you
if
you
do
mind
kathryn
said
for
since
miss
finefeather
is
ill
i
may
at
least
be
able
to
give
her
some
advice
that
will
help
her
roberta
glanced
gratefully
at
her
friend
i
had
hoped
that
you
would
want
to
come
with
me
she
said
but
i
did
not
like
to
ask
knowing
that
your
own
mission
might
be
imperative
no
it
is
not
then
having
dismissed
the
taxi
driver
kathryn
said
i
know
this
building
it
is
where
a
large
number
of
poor
struggling
artists
have
rooms
on
each
floor
there
is
one
community
kitchen
a
janitor
appeared
from
the
basement
at
their
ring
she
said
that
miss
finefeather
lived
on
the
very
top
floor
and
that
the
young
ladies
might
go
right
up
and
she
did
hope
that
they
would
be
on
time
on
time
for
what
kathryn
paused
to
inquire
the
woman
gave
an
indifferent
shrug
oh
she
informed
them
ever
so
often
one
of
the
artists
gets
discouraged
and
then
she
happens
to
remember
that
the
river
is
so
very
far
away
also
they
just
go
to
sleep
sometimes
another
shrug
and
with
the
added
remark
that
she
did
blame
them
much
the
woman
returned
to
her
dreary
home
bobs
shuddered
what
if
they
were
too
late
poor
miss
finefeather
if
she
were
really
winnie
as
roberta
so
hoped
would
not
need
be
discouraged
when
she
had
a
fine
home
and
a
mother
whose
only
interest
in
life
was
to
find
her
they
were
up
the
long
steep
flight
of
stairs
leading
to
the
top
floor
when
bobs
paused
and
looked
back
at
her
friend
as
she
said
almost
afraid
that
this
girl
can
not
be
the
one
i
am
seeking
winnie
could
not
be
discouraged
in
only
three
days
i
thought
that
at
once
kathryn
replied
but
she
is
someone
in
trouble
and
so
i
must
go
to
her
and
see
if
i
can
help
in
silence
they
continued
to
climb
to
the
top
floor
which
was
divided
into
four
small
rooms
three
of
the
doors
were
locked
but
the
fourth
opened
at
their
touch
revealing
a
room
so
dark
that
at
first
they
could
only
see
the
form
of
the
bed
and
were
relieved
to
note
that
someone
was
lying
upon
it
but
at
their
entrance
there
was
no
movement
from
the
silent
figure
maybe
after
all
we
came
too
late
bobs
said
softly
and
how
her
heart
ached
for
the
poor
girl
lying
there
and
she
wondered
who
it
might
be
chapter
xix
the
lost
is
found
kathryn
crossed
to
the
one
window
and
drew
up
the
shade
it
was
late
afternoon
and
almost
dusk
on
that
north
side
of
the
house
the
dim
light
revealed
on
the
pillow
a
face
so
still
and
white
that
bobs
was
sure
only
death
could
make
it
so
for
one
long
moment
she
gazed
before
she
recognized
the
girl
lying
on
the
bed
and
no
wonder
for
great
was
the
change
in
her
gwen
it
our
own
sister
gwen
she
cried
as
one
who
can
scarcely
believe
the
evidence
of
her
senses
down
by
the
bedside
roberta
knelt
and
took
one
of
the
lifeless
white
hands
in
her
own
oh
gwen
she
implored
why
did
you
do
it
you
thought
we
did
want
you
you
believed
that
in
all
the
world
there
was
no
one
who
loved
you
no
home
in
which
you
were
welcome
oh
how
selfish
i
been
gwen
forgive
me
sister
i
should
have
tried
to
help
you
i
was
the
one
really
who
was
selfish
for
i
wanted
adventure
i
did
try
to
think
what
it
would
mean
to
you
but
o
i
will
i
will
gwen
if
only
you
will
live
why
do
you
open
your
eyes
gwen
then
as
there
was
no
response
from
the
apparently
lifeless
form
on
the
bed
bobs
looked
up
at
her
friend
as
she
implored
kathryn
why
gwen
open
her
eyes
are
we
too
late
o
do
say
that
we
are
it
will
kill
glow
she
thinks
that
it
is
her
fault
that
gwen
left
she
feels
that
she
turned
one
of
mother
own
daughters
out
of
our
home
kathryn
who
had
been
hunting
about
the
room
as
though
in
search
of
something
as
indeed
she
had
been
gave
an
exclamation
of
relief
and
going
to
bobs
she
held
out
a
small
vial
gwen
is
dead
she
said
it
was
poison
that
she
took
just
a
heavy
dose
of
sleeping
powder
however
she
will
probably
continue
in
this
deathlike
sleep
for
hours
and
yet
she
may
soon
recover
we
have
no
time
to
delay
i
will
remain
here
while
you
go
to
the
corner
drug
store
and
telephone
to
my
hospital
for
an
ambulance
just
say
that
it
is
for
miss
de
laney
and
they
will
respond
at
once
while
she
is
unable
to
protest
we
will
take
her
to
your
home
bobs
had
arisen
but
lovingly
she
stooped
and
kissed
the
white
face
that
was
so
unlike
the
proud
beautiful
one
she
had
last
seen
on
that
day
when
they
had
planned
leaving
their
long
island
home
tears
fell
unheeded
as
roberta
whispered
to
ears
that
could
not
hear
and
when
you
waken
sister
dear
you
will
be
in
a
home
that
wants
you
and
our
gloria
who
has
tried
to
be
mother
to
us
all
these
years
will
be
at
your
side
smiling
down
and
a
new
life
will
begin
for
you
and
for
us
all
then
almost
blinded
by
her
tears
roberta
descended
the
long
dark
flight
of
stairs
and
telephoned
not
only
to
the
hospital
but
also
to
gloria
telling
her
the
wonderful
news
and
bidding
her
prepare
bobs
own
room
for
the
sister
who
was
coming
home
two
hours
later
gwendolyn
who
had
not
awakened
was
lying
in
the
comfortable
bed
in
bobs
room
her
three
sisters
and
their
friend
kathryn
de
laney
stood
watching
her
in
the
shaded
the
expression
on
the
face
of
gloria
told
more
than
words
could
have
done
what
it
meant
to
her
to
have
this
one
of
her
dear
mother
daughters
back
in
the
home
and
a
real
home
it
is
going
to
be
to
her
from
now
on
if
patient
love
can
make
it
so
gloria
said
then
to
the
nurse
she
turned
asking
will
it
be
long
before
she
wakens
kathryn
it
ought
not
to
be
long
was
the
reply
which
had
hardly
been
given
when
roberta
whispered
eagerly
glow
i
think
gwen
moved
the
eyes
that
looked
so
wearily
out
at
them
were
about
to
close
as
though
nothing
mattered
when
suddenly
they
were
again
opened
with
a
brightening
expression
and
yet
they
did
not
look
quite
natural
holding
out
her
arms
toward
the
oldest
sister
the
girl
on
the
bed
cried
eagerly
mother
i
have
come
to
you
after
all
i
took
something
i
wanted
to
come
her
voice
trailed
away
and
again
she
closed
her
eyes
gloria
was
the
one
of
the
girls
who
looked
most
like
their
mother
dear
dear
sister
glow
said
trying
not
to
sob
you
are
home
again
i
am
sure
that
our
mother
led
us
to
you
try
to
get
strong
we
will
help
you
gwendolyn
for
truly
we
love
you
no
one
knows
little
gwen
how
your
big
sister
has
wanted
you
ca
you
try
to
forgive
me
for
having
spoken
impatiently
if
not
for
my
sake
at
least
for
the
sake
of
our
mother
gwendolyn
looked
at
the
face
bent
close
above
her
as
though
trying
to
recall
the
past
then
reaching
out
a
frail
hand
she
said
i
glow
am
the
one
who
should
be
forgiven
then
she
closed
her
eyes
and
a
moment
later
kathryn
said
that
she
was
asleep
but
that
this
time
it
was
a
natural
sleep
from
great
weariness
when
she
wakens
again
give
her
broth
for
i
fear
she
is
too
nearly
starved
to
take
heavier
food
just
now
chapter
xx
a
failure
that
was
success
the
day
following
that
on
which
gwen
had
been
found
detective
bobs
had
gone
early
in
the
morning
to
report
at
the
fourth
avenue
branch
of
the
burns
agency
jewett
she
began
at
once
as
a
detective
i
certainly
am
a
failure
the
young
man
laughed
i
agree
with
you
that
in
one
way
you
certainly
are
but
nevertheless
you
accomplished
your
mission
bobs
expression
of
blank
surprise
seemed
to
delight
her
employer
but
jewett
what
can
you
mean
it
was
my
sister
whom
i
found
i
did
not
find
miss
yes
you
did
and
you
talked
with
her
or
to
her
rather
well
i
be
flabbergasted
then
bobs
apologized
pardon
my
lingo
jewett
our
gardener
boy
used
to
say
that
when
he
was
greatly
astonished
and
i
certainly
never
was
more
so
when
in
the
name
of
mystery
did
i
talk
to
that
young
lady
and
where
it
was
at
the
first
theater
that
you
visited
miss
winifred
said
that
you
came
into
the
dressing
room
and
that
after
two
of
the
girls
called
pink
and
bee
had
talked
with
you
awhile
you
turned
to
her
for
her
mirror
was
nearest
you
and
asked
her
directly
if
she
liked
the
life
of
a
chorus
girl
she
did
not
know
how
to
reply
for
the
truth
was
that
her
three
days
experience
on
the
stage
had
greatly
disillusioned
her
she
had
found
the
rough
ways
of
the
girls
repellent
to
her
refined
sensitive
nature
and
she
was
afraid
of
the
stage
manager
whose
criticisms
were
sarcastic
and
even
unkind
while
she
was
hesitating
bee
it
seems
had
replied
for
her
and
then
it
was
that
you
had
explained
your
mission
she
of
course
had
not
given
her
real
name
and
so
no
one
suspected
that
she
was
miss
winifred
her
pride
alone
kept
her
from
following
you
and
confessing
her
identity
she
had
declared
to
her
mother
that
she
would
live
her
own
life
in
her
own
way
and
she
could
not
bear
to
acknowledge
her
defeat
too
there
was
one
bright
spot
in
her
new
profession
which
was
that
the
star
miss
merryheart
had
singled
her
out
and
was
very
kind
to
her
that
same
afternoon
it
seems
after
the
matinee
jewett
continued
miss
merryheart
sent
for
her
to
come
to
her
dressing
room
the
others
were
jealous
and
said
things
that
were
so
unkind
and
untrue
that
the
sensitive
girl
was
almost
in
tears
when
she
reached
the
room
of
the
star
when
the
door
had
been
closed
and
they
were
alone
miss
merryheart
placed
kindly
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
looked
deep
into
the
eyes
little
girl
she
said
did
you
tell
our
visitor
that
you
are
winifred
of
course
the
girl
was
amazed
and
greatly
puzzled
for
she
had
told
miss
merryheart
nothing
at
all
concerning
her
past
or
her
identity
and
so
she
asked
her
how
she
had
known
the
star
replied
have
been
long
on
the
stage
and
i
know
when
a
girl
has
been
brought
up
in
an
environment
different
from
the
others
too
i
saw
last
night
that
you
were
greatly
disillusioned
and
i
realized
by
the
frightened
anxious
glances
that
you
cast
about
the
audience
that
you
feared
someone
might
be
there
who
would
recognize
you
in
spite
of
your
disguise
and
when
our
visitor
today
told
me
that
in
this
city
there
was
a
home
made
desolate
a
mother
heart
breaking
because
a
little
girl
had
run
away
to
go
on
the
stage
why
should
i
guess
that
you
are
the
one
then
she
added
me
your
telephone
number
dear
and
that
jewett
concluded
is
how
it
chanced
that
an
hour
later
winifred
was
restored
to
the
arms
of
her
mother
who
at
once
canceled
her
passage
for
europe
as
a
year
abroad
would
not
be
needed
to
disillusion
the
little
actress
that
wonderful
miss
merryheart
bobs
said
irrelevantly
i
love
her
and
i
want
to
know
her
better
jewett
smiled
miss
vandergrift
as
you
say
you
are
not
exactly
a
successful
detective
and
yet
in
both
of
the
cases
on
which
you
have
been
engaged
you
have
accomplished
what
might
be
called
indirect
success
for
even
though
you
did
help
him
to
escape
you
discovered
the
thief
of
the
rare
old
book
and
you
have
been
instrumental
in
restoring
a
lost
girl
to
her
mother
now
i
have
another
case
and
one
quite
different
for
you
do
you
wish
to
take
it
bobs
laughed
jewett
she
said
like
winnie
i
fear
that
i
too
am
disillusioned
i
find
that
a
detective
is
not
allowed
to
have
sympathy
honestly
if
my
life
had
depended
upon
it
i
could
have
turned
that
old
man
over
to
justice
but
what
is
the
new
case
roberta
could
not
believe
that
she
was
hearing
aright
when
he
told
her
jewett
she
exclaimed
will
you
kindly
say
that
over
again
the
young
man
was
finding
his
new
assistant
refreshingly
different
i
merely
stated
that
i
would
like
you
to
help
us
find
the
heir
to
the
pensinger
mansion
who
he
paused
and
snapped
his
fingers
i
declare
he
ejaculated
i
had
quite
forgotten
for
the
moment
that
is
your
present
home
all
the
better
for
there
may
be
some
important
evidence
right
on
the
premises
come
into
my
office
and
i
will
read
all
the
data
that
we
have
filed
up
to
the
present
very
much
interested
roberta
followed
the
young
man
wondering
what
she
was
to
hear
when
they
were
seated
jewett
said
perhaps
you
know
something
of
the
story
of
the
pensinger
family
roberta
replied
that
she
did
that
a
neighbor
miss
selenski
had
told
about
the
lost
daughter
marilyn
and
about
her
father
strange
will
there
is
little
more
known
by
anyone
jewett
said
judge
whose
father
was
pensinger
legal
advisor
and
close
friend
is
very
eager
to
find
the
heir
before
it
is
too
late
not
many
years
remain
before
the
property
according
to
the
will
is
to
be
sold
the
money
to
be
devoted
to
charity
judge
cory
declares
that
it
haunts
him
sometimes
as
the
old
house
is
supposed
to
be
haunted
he
feels
sure
that
marilyn
is
not
living
but
she
might
have
children
somewhere
who
are
in
need
the
judge
never
accepted
the
theory
which
some
held
that
the
beautiful
girl
leaped
into
the
east
river
on
the
night
that
her
shawl
was
found
on
the
bank
he
believes
that
she
was
secretly
married
and
that
with
her
she
departed
for
his
home
country
hungary
roberta
nodded
o
i
do
hope
so
she
exclaimed
so
eagerly
that
jewett
smiled
but
what
he
said
was
and
so
now
once
again
the
case
is
to
be
reopened
and
as
the
judge
himself
is
very
busy
he
has
turned
the
matter
over
to
his
son
who
has
recently
become
junior
member
of
his
father
firm
ralph
is
young
and
filled
with
fresh
enthusiasms
and
it
is
wish
that
we
put
on
the
case
a
girl
of
about
the
age
that
marilyn
was
at
the
time
if
we
have
one
in
our
employ
since
you
had
not
notified
me
that
you
had
ceased
to
be
one
of
us
i
told
him
that
i
would
procure
just
the
type
of
person
whom
i
believed
best
fitted
to
assist
us
are
you
willing
to
undertake
this
case
miss
vandergrift
bobs
smiled
when
she
heard
the
name
gladly
she
said
rising
and
i
hope
i
will
not
chapter
xxi
a
new
arrival
when
roberta
reached
home
that
day
she
began
to
sniff
for
the
house
seemed
to
be
pervaded
with
a
most
delicious
aroma
ohee
fried
chicken
if
i
guess
aright
she
thought
the
front
room
being
vacant
she
skipped
down
the
long
wide
hall
and
pounced
into
the
sunny
combination
kitchen
and
lena
may
smiled
over
her
shoulder
to
greet
the
newcomer
she
was
busy
at
the
stove
preparing
the
noon
meal
gwendolyn
made
comfortable
on
a
pillowed
reclining
chair
was
lying
in
the
sunshine
near
the
blossoming
she
also
smiled
though
she
was
too
weak
and
weary
to
speak
bobs
kissed
her
tenderly
and
then
inquired
say
lena
may
why
all
this
festiveness
it
anyone
birthday
is
it
you
know
it
is
their
youngest
replied
as
she
stopped
to
open
the
oven
door
revealing
a
tin
of
biscuits
that
were
browning
within
then
rising
she
added
but
nevertheless
we
are
celebrating
you
see
nurse
kathryn
ordered
chicken
broth
for
gwen
and
having
made
that
i
decided
to
fry
the
remaining
pieces
because
we
are
going
to
have
company
for
lunch
who
pray
bobs
was
removing
her
hat
and
coat
as
she
spoke
just
then
gloria
came
in
from
the
settlement
house
and
she
inquired
as
she
glanced
about
has
the
company
come
not
yet
lena
may
looked
at
the
old
grandfather
clock
it
lacks
two
minutes
of
being
noon
they
will
be
here
promptly
at
twelve
i
do
believe
that
you
are
all
trying
to
arouse
my
curiosity
bobs
said
well
the
deed
is
done
so
fire
ahead
and
tell
me
who
is
to
be
the
victim
victim
indeed
lena
may
tossed
her
curly
head
with
pretended
indignation
i
have
nine
minds
not
to
give
you
a
single
piece
of
this
delicious
fried
chicken
because
of
that
that
bobs
helped
her
out
slam
on
your
cooking
is
what
you
really
mean
but
of
course
you
ca
use
slang
not
even
in
a
pinch
but
i
say
is
our
honored
guest
fine
or
superfine
gloria
and
lena
may
exchanged
amused
glances
it
was
the
former
who
replied
the
guest
of
honor
is
to
be
a
young
gentleman
and
as
to
his
identity
you
may
have
three
guesses
this
had
always
been
their
method
of
telling
each
other
interesting
news
dick
de
laney
is
in
town
is
he
roberta
inquired
in
so
and
little
interested
a
manner
that
again
gloria
realized
that
her
sister
did
not
greatly
care
for
the
lad
who
had
loved
her
since
the
pinafore
days
not
that
i
heard
of
lena
may
said
now
you
may
guess
again
but
before
this
could
be
done
the
heavy
knocker
on
the
front
door
was
announcing
the
arrival
of
someone
and
gloria
went
to
answer
its
summons
bobs
skipped
over
to
the
stove
as
she
said
hurriedly
tell
me
quickly
who
is
coming
so
that
i
may
be
prepared
nell
wiggin
and
her
brother
dean
was
the
whispered
reply
he
came
in
on
the
train
nell
went
to
meet
him
and
i
told
her
to
bring
him
over
here
to
lunch
i
thought
it
would
be
pleasant
for
both
of
them
you
a
trump
bobs
began
but
paused
for
gloria
was
opening
the
door
saying
sisters
here
are
nell
and
her
brother
dean
then
to
the
tall
pale
lad
with
the
dreamy
eyes
she
added
this
sister
is
gwendolyn
who
has
been
ill
and
this
is
lena
may
fork
in
hand
symbolizing
the
fact
that
she
is
also
our
housekeeper
roberta
we
call
bobs
for
every
family
has
need
of
a
boy
and
bobsy
has
always
done
her
best
to
fill
the
requirements
the
lad
unused
to
girls
acknowledged
these
introductions
rather
shyly
bobs
knowing
that
he
was
conscious
of
his
left
arm
which
he
could
not
move
said
at
once
in
her
merry
nonsensical
manner
if
so
many
sisters
wo
frighten
you
dean
i
retire
from
the
role
of
brother
and
let
you
fill
it
then
she
added
i
not
going
to
call
you
mr
wiggin
it
is
too
formal
the
lad
flushed
in
his
effort
to
reply
but
lena
may
saved
him
from
further
embarrassment
by
saying
nell
you
and
your
brother
may
sit
on
either
side
of
gloria
bobsy
will
you
serve
the
chicken
gwen
had
her
broth
at
eleven
so
she
is
hungry
just
now
realizing
that
the
lad
who
had
lived
only
on
remote
new
england
farms
would
rather
listen
than
talk
bobs
monopolized
the
conversation
in
her
usual
breezy
manner
and
often
when
she
glanced
his
way
she
noted
that
the
soft
brown
eyes
of
the
lad
were
smiling
as
though
he
were
much
amused
but
after
lunch
she
spoke
to
him
directly
dean
she
said
your
sister
tells
me
that
you
love
books
indeed
i
do
the
boy
replied
but
i
have
seen
very
few
and
have
owned
only
one
my
goodness
bobs
exclaimed
come
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
several
hundred
several
hundred
books
the
lad
gasped
quite
forgetting
his
in
his
astonishment
at
this
amazing
remark
bobs
nodded
mysteriously
as
she
led
the
way
to
the
room
overhead
where
in
the
dim
light
dean
beheld
old
books
in
dusty
piles
everywhere
about
there
was
a
sudden
glow
of
pleasure
in
the
eyes
of
the
boy
which
told
bobs
that
he
was
indeed
a
booklover
what
a
treat
this
will
be
he
exclaimed
if
i
may
browse
up
here
when
i
wish
then
he
added
as
a
new
thought
presented
itself
but
miss
roberta
i
must
not
spend
my
time
in
idle
reading
i
want
to
find
some
way
to
earn
money
eagerly
anxiously
his
eyes
turned
toward
her
can
you
suggest
anything
that
i
might
be
able
to
do
for
one
panicky
moment
bobs
thoughts
groped
wildly
for
some
profession
that
a
lad
might
follow
then
she
had
what
she
believed
was
a
wonderful
inspiration
and
she
said
with
her
usual
impulsiveness
i
do
indeed
know
just
the
very
thing
you
and
i
will
start
an
old
book
shop
and
you
may
be
manager
the
lad
pale
face
flushed
with
pleasure
do
you
really
mean
it
miss
vandergrift
he
asked
eagerly
how
i
would
like
that
in
her
characteristic
manner
bobs
wanted
to
settle
the
matter
at
once
and
so
she
tripped
downstairs
with
dean
following
she
found
that
gwendolyn
had
gone
back
to
bed
and
that
the
kitchen
having
been
tidied
the
three
girls
were
sitting
about
the
fireplace
talking
softly
together
when
they
heard
bobs
inspiration
they
all
thought
it
a
splendid
plan
and
nell
said
that
there
was
a
vacant
room
adjoining
the
office
of
the
model
tenement
that
she
had
been
told
she
might
use
in
any
way
that
she
wished
as
there
was
a
door
opening
upon
the
street
she
believed
it
would
be
an
ideal
place
for
an
old
book
shop
rising
nell
continued
i
will
telephone
at
once
to
be
sure
that
she
is
still
willing
that
i
use
the
room
as
i
desire
this
was
done
and
that
most
kindly
woman
in
her
beautiful
home
on
riverside
drive
listened
with
interest
to
the
plan
and
gave
the
permission
that
was
requested
moreover
upon
leaving
the
telephone
she
made
a
note
in
her
engagement
book
at
the
next
board
meeting
suggest
that
a
visit
be
made
to
the
old
book
shop
in
the
model
tenement
when
nell
returned
with
the
information
that
they
might
do
as
they
wished
with
the
room
bobs
and
dean
went
at
once
to
a
lumber
yard
near
the
docks
and
ordered
the
shelves
they
would
need
an
hour
later
antovich
and
several
of
his
boy
companions
had
carried
the
old
books
from
the
pensinger
mansion
and
had
heaped
them
upon
the
floor
of
the
pleasant
vacant
room
which
opened
directly
upon
the
sidewalk
on
street
when
bobs
left
dean
was
busy
with
hammer
and
nails
and
happier
perhaps
than
he
had
been
in
the
twenty
years
of
his
life
chapter
xxii
a
case
for
two
as
bobs
left
the
small
shop
she
glanced
at
her
watch
and
finding
that
it
was
nearly
four
she
hastened
her
steps
recalling
that
that
was
the
hour
when
she
might
expect
a
call
from
the
young
lawyer
as
she
turned
the
corner
at
the
east
river
she
saw
a
small
auto
drawing
up
at
the
curb
in
front
of
the
pensinger
mansion
and
from
it
leaped
a
fashionably
groomed
young
man
truly
an
unusual
sight
in
that
part
of
new
york
east
side
where
the
clothes
even
at
best
descended
from
father
to
son
often
made
smaller
by
merely
being
haggled
off
at
arm
and
ankle
no
wonder
that
ralph
was
the
object
of
many
an
admiring
glance
from
the
dark
eyes
of
the
young
hungarian
women
who
with
gayly
colored
shawls
over
their
heads
at
that
moment
were
passing
on
their
way
to
the
tobacco
factory
but
ralph
was
quite
unconscious
of
their
scrutiny
for
having
seen
bobs
approaching
he
hastened
to
meet
her
hat
in
hand
his
face
glowing
with
anticipation
have
you
found
a
clue
as
yet
miss
vandergrift
he
asked
eagerly
when
greetings
had
been
exchanged
roberta
laughed
no
and
i
have
to
confess
that
i
have
given
the
matter
a
moment
thought
since
we
parted
three
hours
ago
is
that
all
it
has
been
to
me
it
has
seemed
three
centuries
the
boy
said
this
so
sincerely
that
roberta
believed
that
he
must
be
greatly
interested
in
the
pensinger
mystery
it
did
not
enter
her
remotest
thought
that
he
might
also
be
interested
in
her
having
reached
the
mansion
bobs
led
the
way
up
the
wide
stone
steps
saying
i
do
hope
gloria
and
lena
may
are
at
home
i
want
my
sisters
to
meet
you
but
no
one
was
to
be
seen
gwen
was
still
in
her
room
while
the
other
girls
had
not
returned
from
the
settlement
house
well
there
another
time
coming
bobs
flashed
a
smile
at
her
companion
then
led
the
way
to
the
wide
fireplace
where
comfortable
chairs
awaited
them
and
they
seated
themselves
facing
the
still
burning
embers
i
say
miss
vandergrift
ralph
began
you
a
girl
and
you
ought
to
know
better
than
i
just
what
another
girl
even
though
she
lived
years
ago
would
do
under
the
circumstances
with
which
we
are
both
familiar
if
you
loved
a
man
of
whom
your
mother
did
not
approve
would
you
really
drown
yourself
or
would
you
marry
him
and
permit
your
parents
to
believe
that
you
were
dead
bobs
sat
so
long
gazing
into
the
fire
that
the
lad
earnestly
watching
her
wondered
at
her
deep
thought
at
last
she
spoke
i
could
have
hurt
my
mother
that
way
she
said
and
there
were
tears
in
the
hazel
eyes
that
were
lifted
to
her
companion
i
would
have
known
that
her
dearest
desire
would
be
for
my
ultimate
happiness
but
mothers
are
different
we
will
have
to
confess
the
lad
declared
marilyn
may
have
thought
only
of
social
fitness
then
as
he
glanced
about
the
old
salon
and
up
at
the
huge
crystal
chandeliers
he
added
i
judge
that
the
pensingers
were
people
of
great
wealth
in
those
early
days
and
probably
leaders
in
society
i
believe
that
they
were
roberta
agreed
but
my
mother
had
a
different
standard
she
believed
that
mental
and
soul
companionship
should
be
the
big
thing
in
marriage
and
for
that
matter
so
do
i
ralph
felt
awed
this
was
a
very
different
girl
from
the
hoidenish
young
detective
with
whom
he
had
so
brief
an
acquaintance
miss
vandergrift
he
said
impulsively
i
wish
i
had
a
sister
like
you
and
would
my
mother
be
pleased
though
if
you
were
her
daughter
a
girl
i
am
sure
would
have
been
more
of
a
comfort
and
companion
to
her
when
my
brother
desmond
died
then
he
added
after
a
moment
of
silence
i
can
get
your
point
of
view
all
right
i
would
break
my
heart
by
pretending
to
drown
myself
not
even
if
the
heavens
fell
i
like
to
know
your
mother
roberta
said
she
must
be
a
wonderful
woman
she
is
the
lad
declared
i
want
you
to
meet
her
as
soon
as
she
returns
just
now
she
is
touring
the
west
with
friends
but
to
get
back
to
marilyn
pensinger
from
the
little
that
we
know
of
her
family
i
conclude
that
her
mother
was
a
snob
and
placed
social
distinction
above
her
daughter
happiness
but
the
very
fact
that
the
father
made
his
will
as
he
did
proves
does
it
that
he
loved
his
daughter
more
sincerely
he
did
not
cut
her
off
with
a
shilling
when
he
believed
that
she
had
eloped
with
a
foreign
musician
instead
he
arranged
so
that
a
descendant
of
that
hungarian
whose
name
we
do
not
even
know
would
inherit
all
that
pensinger
possessed
but
this
is
getting
us
anywhere
do
you
happen
to
know
anyone
who
has
recently
come
over
from
hungary
bobs
smiled
would
that
be
grasping
at
straws
maybe
but
do
you
roberta
thought
a
moment
then
looked
up
brightly
i
believe
i
do
at
least
i
know
a
hungarian
his
name
is
hardinian
and
he
is
doing
social
welfare
work
he
speaks
perfect
english
however
and
may
have
been
born
in
this
country
suppose
we
go
over
to
his
clubhouse
and
interview
him
then
as
she
rose
she
added
you
will
like
hardinian
he
has
such
beautiful
eyes
ralph
laughed
as
he
also
arose
is
that
a
girl
reason
for
liking
a
man
he
inquired
then
he
added
would
i
were
a
hungarian
that
i
might
have
interesting
eyes
as
it
is
mine
are
the
plain
unromantic
american
variety
roberta
smiled
at
her
new
friend
but
what
she
said
showed
that
her
thought
was
far
from
the
subject
before
we
go
i
want
to
be
sure
that
my
sister
gwen
is
comfortable
gwendolyn
was
sleeping
so
quietly
that
roberta
believed
she
would
not
awaken
before
lena
may
return
and
so
beckoning
the
lad
to
follow
she
left
the
house
closing
the
door
softly
ralph
turned
and
looked
back
at
the
upper
windows
of
the
rooms
that
were
not
occupied
as
he
inquired
do
you
have
a
hunch
that
the
old
mansion
holds
the
clue
we
are
seeking
roberta
reply
was
only
the
ghost
of
marilyn
knows
when
the
two
were
in
the
small
luxurious
car
and
going
very
slowly
because
of
the
congested
traffic
down
first
avenue
ralph
said
tell
me
a
little
about
your
sisters
and
yourself
that
i
may
feel
better
acquainted
and
so
briefly
roberta
told
the
story
of
their
coming
to
the
east
side
to
live
i
say
miss
vandergrift
that
certainly
was
hard
luck
losing
the
fine
old
place
that
your
family
had
supposed
was
its
own
for
so
many
generations
then
the
lad
added
with
sincere
admiration
you
girls
certainly
are
trumps
i
mighty
glad
i
met
you
and
i
hope
you
be
glad
too
some
day
why
i
glad
right
this
very
moment
roberta
assured
him
in
so
impersonal
a
manner
that
the
lad
did
not
feel
greatly
flattered
indeed
he
was
rather
pleased
that
this
was
so
being
the
son
of
a
famous
judge
possessed
of
good
looks
charming
manners
and
all
the
money
he
wished
to
spend
ralph
had
been
greatly
sought
after
by
the
fond
mothers
of
the
girls
in
his
set
if
not
by
the
maidens
themselves
and
it
seemed
rather
an
interesting
change
to
meet
a
girl
whose
interest
in
him
was
not
personal
after
a
silent
moment
in
which
the
lad
entire
attention
had
been
centered
on
extricating
his
small
auto
from
a
crush
of
trucks
and
foreign
pedestrians
he
turned
and
smiled
at
his
companion
let
turn
over
to
central
park
now
he
suggested
it
a
little
round
about
i
agree
but
it
will
be
pleasanter
riding
it
was
decidedly
out
of
their
way
but
a
glance
at
her
wrist
watch
assured
roberta
that
lena
may
would
have
returned
to
be
with
gwen
by
that
time
and
so
she
was
in
no
especial
hurry
how
beautiful
the
park
seemed
after
the
thronged
noisy
east
side
with
its
mingled
odors
from
tobacco
fish
markets
and
general
squalor
there
now
we
can
talk
ralph
said
as
he
drove
slowly
along
one
of
the
winding
avenues
under
a
canopy
formed
by
trees
what
shall
it
be
about
you
roberta
replied
tell
me
about
yourself
there
is
much
to
tell
the
lad
began
my
brother
desmond
and
i
grew
up
in
a
happy
home
during
the
winter
months
we
attended
a
boys
school
up
the
hudson
and
each
summer
vacation
we
traveled
with
our
parents
we
have
been
about
everywhere
i
do
believe
desmond
and
i
were
all
in
all
to
each
other
we
were
twins
perhaps
that
was
why
we
seemed
to
love
each
other
even
more
than
brothers
usually
do
i
did
not
feel
the
need
of
any
other
boy
companion
and
when
at
last
we
entered
college
we
were
permitted
to
be
roommates
in
our
sophomore
year
desmond
died
and
i
did
much
care
what
happened
after
that
it
seemed
as
though
i
never
could
room
with
another
chap
but
at
last
the
dormitories
were
so
crowded
that
i
had
to
take
a
fellow
in
that
was
two
years
ago
and
today
dick
de
laney
is
as
close
to
me
as
desmond
was
almost
not
quite
of
course
no
one
will
ever
be
that
but
i
tell
you
miss
vandergrift
dick
is
a
fine
chap
clear
through
to
the
core
i
bank
on
dick
doing
the
honorable
thing
come
what
might
i
a
year
older
than
he
is
and
he
wo
finish
until
june
then
he
coming
on
here
to
little
old
new
york
and
spend
a
month
with
me
i
say
miss
vandergrift
i
like
to
have
you
meet
him
roberta
smiled
i
been
waiting
for
you
to
come
to
a
period
that
i
might
tell
you
that
dick
de
laney
and
i
were
playmates
when
we
wore
pinafores
you
see
they
were
our
neighbors
bobs
said
this
in
so
a
tone
that
ralph
did
not
think
for
one
moment
that
this
could
be
the
girl
his
pal
had
once
told
him
that
he
loved
and
hoped
to
win
if
only
ralph
had
realized
this
much
so
might
have
been
saved
for
one
of
them
chapter
xxiii
it
was
when
the
left
the
quiet
park
where
long
shadows
were
lying
on
the
grass
and
where
birds
were
calling
softly
from
one
rustling
tree
to
another
it
seems
like
a
different
world
does
it
bobs
said
as
she
smiled
in
her
friendliest
way
at
the
lad
at
the
wheel
she
had
felt
a
real
tenderness
for
her
companion
since
he
had
told
her
about
desmond
and
she
was
glad
that
an
old
friend
of
hers
had
been
a
comfort
to
him
it
does
indeed
he
declared
with
a
last
glance
back
at
the
park
i
like
trees
better
than
i
do
many
people
we
have
some
wonderful
old
elms
around
our
summer
home
in
the
orange
hills
when
my
mother
returns
i
shall
ask
her
to
invite
you
four
girls
to
one
of
her
or
to
one
that
she
will
plan
just
for
me
after
dick
comes
then
as
they
were
again
on
the
thronged
east
side
the
lad
said
street
beyond
second
you
said
did
you
yes
there
is
the
boys
club
house
just
ahead
roberta
exclaimed
then
as
they
drew
up
at
the
curb
she
added
good
the
door
is
open
and
so
hardinian
probably
is
here
the
young
man
whom
they
sought
was
still
there
and
as
they
entered
the
low
wooden
temporary
structure
which
covered
a
vacant
lot
between
two
rickety
old
tenements
they
saw
him
smiling
down
at
a
group
of
excited
newsies
who
were
evidently
relating
to
him
some
occurrence
of
their
day
he
at
once
recognized
roberta
and
made
his
way
toward
her
while
the
boys
to
whom
he
had
spoken
a
few
words
of
dismissal
departed
through
a
side
door
leaving
the
big
room
empty
bobs
held
out
her
hand
as
she
said
hardinian
this
is
my
friend
and
we
have
come
i
do
believe
on
a
wild
goose
chase
ralph
at
once
liked
the
young
man
with
the
lithe
wiry
build
and
the
dark
face
that
was
so
wonderfully
expressive
he
looked
to
be
about
years
of
age
although
he
might
have
been
even
a
year
or
two
older
an
amused
smile
accompanied
his
question
miss
vandergrift
am
i
the
wild
goose
the
girl
laughed
that
was
a
very
graceful
way
of
stating
our
errand
she
said
so
i
will
begin
again
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
cory
and
i
are
amateur
detectives
again
hardinian
smiled
and
with
a
swinging
gesture
that
seemed
to
include
the
entire
place
he
said
search
where
you
will
but
i
doubt
if
you
will
detect
here
a
hidden
wild
goose
then
more
seriously
he
added
come
let
us
be
seated
in
the
library
corner
for
i
am
sure
that
your
visit
has
some
real
purpose
hardinian
listened
to
the
story
of
the
pensinger
mystery
which
as
little
was
really
known
about
it
took
but
a
brief
moment
to
tell
at
its
conclusion
he
said
did
you
think
miss
vandergrift
that
i
might
know
something
about
all
this
i
truly
do
not
although
i
was
born
in
hungary
while
i
was
still
an
infant
my
parents
went
to
england
where
i
was
educated
and
only
last
year
the
need
of
my
own
people
brought
me
here
where
so
many
of
them
come
believing
that
they
are
to
find
freedom
and
fortune
but
how
soon
they
are
disillusioned
for
they
find
poverty
suffering
and
conditions
to
which
they
are
unused
and
with
which
they
know
not
how
to
cope
many
of
the
older
ones
lose
out
and
their
children
are
left
waifs
all
alone
in
this
great
city
i
found
when
i
reached
here
that
they
needed
me
most
the
homeless
boys
who
many
of
them
slept
huddled
over
some
grating
through
which
heat
came
or
in
hallways
crowded
together
for
warmth
until
they
were
told
to
move
on
and
so
the
first
thing
that
i
did
was
to
rent
this
vacant
lot
and
build
a
temporary
wooden
structure
now
with
these
walls
lined
with
bunks
as
you
see
i
can
make
many
of
the
boys
fairly
comfortable
at
night
i
say
hardinian
ralph
exclaimed
this
is
a
splendid
work
that
you
are
doing
i
coming
over
some
night
soon
if
i
may
i
want
to
see
the
place
in
full
swing
come
whenever
you
wish
was
the
reply
and
then
as
roberta
had
risen
the
young
men
did
also
the
girl
smiled
as
she
said
honestly
hardinian
i
knew
in
my
bones
that
you
would
not
be
able
to
help
us
solve
the
mystery
but
you
were
the
only
hungarian
with
whom
i
had
even
the
slightest
speaking
acquaintance
and
so
we
thought
that
we
would
tell
you
the
story
and
if
you
ever
hear
anything
that
might
be
a
clue
let
us
know
wo
you
indeed
i
will
and
gladly
come
over
sunday
afternoon
at
four
if
you
have
no
other
plans
we
have
a
little
service
then
and
the
boys
conduct
it
entirely
when
they
were
again
in
the
small
car
ralph
was
enthusiastic
i
like
that
chap
he
exclaimed
i
wish
detectives
could
plan
to
have
things
turn
out
the
way
an
author
can
if
i
had
the
say
of
it
i
make
hardinian
into
a
descendant
of
marilyn
pensinger
and
then
he
could
inherit
all
of
that
fortune
and
use
it
for
his
homeless
waifs
it
was
after
six
when
the
small
car
stopped
in
front
of
the
pensinger
mansion
and
ralph
declared
that
since
he
had
a
date
with
his
dad
he
could
not
stop
to
meet
the
other
vandergrift
girls
as
he
greatly
desired
that
night
when
ralph
returned
from
an
evening
affair
which
he
had
attended
with
his
father
he
did
not
retire
at
once
instead
he
seated
himself
at
his
desk
and
for
half
an
hour
his
pen
scratched
rapidly
over
a
large
sheet
of
white
paper
he
was
writing
a
letter
to
dick
de
laney
his
friend
telling
him
that
at
last
the
only
girl
in
the
world
had
appeared
in
his
life
i
always
told
you
old
pal
that
i
know
the
girl
who
was
meant
for
me
the
minute
that
i
met
her
but
i
do
believe
that
she
is
going
to
be
hard
to
win
chapter
xxiv
romance
budding
two
weeks
have
passed
since
the
evening
upon
which
bobs
and
her
new
friend
ralph
drove
together
in
central
park
and
told
each
other
briefly
the
story
of
their
lives
it
does
not
take
interested
young
people
long
to
become
acquainted
and
these
two
had
many
opportunities
to
be
together
for
were
they
not
solving
the
pensinger
mystery
and
was
it
not
of
paramount
importance
that
the
poor
defrauded
heir
of
all
those
idle
millions
should
be
found
and
made
happy
with
his
rightful
possessions
of
course
no
other
motive
prompted
ralph
the
rising
young
lawyer
to
seek
the
companionship
of
his
not
only
daily
but
often
in
the
morning
afternoon
and
evening
they
had
sought
clues
everywhere
in
the
mansion
but
the
great
old
rooms
had
failed
to
reveal
aught
that
was
concealed
too
they
had
long
drives
in
the
little
red
car
that
its
owner
called
the
whizz
and
these
frequently
took
them
far
away
from
the
thronged
east
side
along
country
roads
where
quite
undisturbed
they
could
talk
over
possible
clues
and
plan
ways
to
follow
them
and
all
this
time
roberta
really
thought
that
ralph
interest
in
her
was
impersonal
for
the
lad
dreaded
revealing
his
true
feeling
until
she
showed
some
even
remote
sign
of
being
interested
in
him
if
i
tell
bobs
that
i
care
for
her
it
might
queer
the
whole
thing
was
one
thought
suggested
to
him
as
he
rode
home
alone
one
night
through
the
quiet
park
another
thought
was
more
encouraging
it
suggested
but
a
girl
pride
wo
let
her
show
that
she
cares
there
is
only
one
way
to
find
out
and
that
is
to
ask
and
still
another
assured
him
there
is
every
reason
why
roberta
vandergrift
should
be
pleased
you
ralph
have
wealth
and
position
and
can
restore
to
her
all
that
she
has
lost
lots
you
know
about
bobs
the
lad
blurted
out
as
though
someone
really
had
spoken
to
him
my
opinion
is
that
roberta
is
really
grown
up
enough
as
yet
to
think
of
love
she
considers
her
boy
friends
more
as
brothers
and
that
what
they
ought
to
be
first
and
foremost
i
bide
my
time
but
if
i
do
lose
bobs
it
will
be
like
losing
desmond
all
over
again
meanwhile
although
no
progress
had
been
made
in
solving
the
mystery
much
progress
was
being
made
in
other
directions
gloria
with
bobs
and
ralph
had
attended
a
sunday
afternoon
meeting
of
the
boy
club
and
hardinian
had
walked
home
with
them
and
had
remained
for
tea
he
was
very
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
to
talk
with
a
young
woman
whose
interest
in
welfare
work
paralleled
his
own
especially
as
he
had
one
rather
wayward
boy
whom
he
believed
needed
mothering
more
than
all
else
gloria
heart
indeed
was
touched
when
she
heard
the
sad
story
that
the
young
man
had
to
tell
and
she
gladly
offered
to
do
what
she
could
she
invited
the
wayward
boy
to
one
of
her
game
evenings
at
the
settlement
house
and
in
teaching
him
to
play
honestly
she
not
only
won
his
ardent
devotion
but
also
saved
him
from
being
sent
to
the
island
reformatory
for
petty
thievery
after
that
hardinian
frequently
called
upon
gloria
when
he
needed
advice
or
help
the
little
old
book
shop
during
the
eventful
two
weeks
had
started
or
so
it
would
seem
on
a
very
successful
business
career
because
of
the
little
memorandum
that
she
had
made
in
her
note
book
on
the
day
that
nell
wiggin
had
first
telephoned
to
her
did
tell
the
ladies
who
attended
the
next
model
tenement
board
meeting
about
the
shop
and
asked
them
to
visit
it
which
they
did
being
sincerely
interested
in
all
that
pertained
to
their
venture
and
not
only
did
they
buy
books
but
they
left
others
to
be
sold
on
commission
one
glance
at
the
fine
face
of
the
lad
who
was
bookseller
made
them
realize
that
crippled
as
he
might
be
he
would
not
accept
charity
how
business
this
hot
day
bobs
asked
early
one
morning
as
she
poked
her
head
in
at
the
door
she
was
on
her
way
down
to
the
fourth
avenue
branch
of
the
burns
detective
agency
where
she
went
every
day
to
do
a
few
hours
secretarial
work
for
jewett
we
had
a
splendid
trade
yesterday
the
lad
replied
as
he
looked
up
from
the
old
book
of
poetry
which
he
was
reading
and
yet
since
he
held
a
pencil
bobs
concluded
that
he
was
also
writing
verse
as
the
inspiration
came
how
so
she
inquired
the
shop
had
a
visit
from
no
less
a
personage
than
van
loon
the
millionaire
book
collector
of
whom
you
told
me
he
bought
several
volumes
that
i
had
supposed
were
worth
a
farthing
and
what
he
paid
for
them
will
more
than
cover
our
expenses
up
to
date
i
wonder
how
he
happened
to
know
about
this
shop
oh
i
guess
he
goes
nosing
around
after
old
books
sort
of
ferrets
them
out
like
as
not
well
so
long
i
mighty
glad
our
shop
is
financially
on
its
feet
as
bobs
went
on
her
way
down
the
crowded
first
avenue
she
smiled
to
herself
for
it
was
she
who
had
sent
van
loon
a
letter
announcing
the
opening
of
an
old
book
shop
feeling
sure
that
he
would
not
miss
an
opportunity
of
seeing
it
if
it
held
something
that
he
might
desire
fifteen
minutes
after
her
departure
dean
again
heard
the
door
open
and
this
time
a
dear
little
boy
of
three
darted
in
and
hid
beneath
a
counter
peering
out
to
whisper
delightedly
hidin
miss
may
her
arter
me
almost
immediately
the
pursuer
who
was
lena
may
vandergrift
appeared
in
the
doorway
the
young
bookseller
was
on
his
feet
at
once
and
there
was
a
sudden
light
in
the
dreamy
brown
eyes
that
told
its
own
story
good
morning
dean
the
girl
said
have
you
seen
antony
wilovich
i
told
him
to
wait
out
in
front
for
me
so
that
he
could
escort
me
to
the
settlement
house
this
morning
dean
smiled
knowingly
and
replied
which
was
his
part
of
the
game
well
well
has
that
little
scamp
run
away
again
somewhere
and
hidden
i
guess
he
does
love
his
miss
may
or
he
would
do
that
this
always
proved
too
much
for
the
little
fellow
in
hiding
and
from
under
the
counter
he
would
dart
his
arms
extended
then
the
girl
stopping
would
catch
him
in
a
loving
embrace
i
do
so
love
miss
may
the
child
would
protest
i
loves
her
next
most
to
my
muvver
over
dere
a
chubby
finger
would
point
or
the
golden
head
would
nod
in
the
direction
of
the
rickety
tenement
across
the
way
the
very
one
which
miss
selenski
the
former
agent
of
the
model
tenement
had
called
a
fire
trap
this
little
game
of
took
place
every
morning
for
lena
may
had
promised
the
muvver
over
dere
who
was
slowly
dying
of
consumption
that
she
would
call
for
tony
take
him
to
the
settlement
sandpile
and
return
him
safely
at
noon
if
this
was
a
merry
moment
each
day
for
little
tony
it
was
to
dean
wiggin
much
more
the
sweet
sympathetic
girl
in
her
pretty
muslin
dress
and
hat
suggested
to
the
lad
from
the
country
all
that
he
most
loved
the
fragrance
of
blossoms
the
song
of
birds
and
the
peace
of
the
at
noon
time
when
she
was
gone
with
a
friendly
backward
nod
at
the
crippled
bookseller
he
would
always
read
poetry
or
try
to
write
one
that
would
express
what
lena
may
was
to
him
to
little
tony
or
to
the
invalid
mother
who
trusted
her
with
her
one
treasure
and
so
that
two
weeks
had
raised
the
curtain
upon
three
dreams
but
one
of
them
was
to
become
a
tragedy
chapter
xxv
a
sudden
departure
time
a
week
later
hello
bobs
is
that
you
but
it
was
lena
may
who
had
answered
an
imperative
ring
at
the
telephone
and
so
she
replied
oh
good
morning
no
i
am
not
roberta
i
will
call
her
a
moment
later
ralph
knew
that
he
was
talking
to
the
girl
whom
he
loved
i
say
bobety
he
exclaimed
will
you
go
for
a
drive
with
me
right
away
this
minute
please
say
for
she
had
hesitated
i
have
something
of
great
importance
to
tell
you
honestly
i
ca
ralph
was
the
earnest
reply
i
am
going
to
give
lena
may
a
holiday
she
and
dean
wiggin
are
going
to
take
little
tony
wilovich
to
bronx
park
and
spend
the
day
the
little
fellow
is
wild
to
see
the
monkeys
and
lena
may
needs
a
day
among
the
trees
her
youngest
sister
was
at
her
elbow
whispering
we
can
go
some
other
time
dear
if
there
something
that
you
want
to
do
but
roberta
shook
her
head
there
was
a
brief
silence
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
then
the
lad
spoke
again
i
say
bobs
how
are
they
going
on
the
l
that
what
i
thought
suppose
i
get
dad
big
car
we
can
take
them
out
to
the
park
and
then
on
the
way
back
you
and
i
can
have
the
visit
i
want
in
fact
i
to
see
you
bobs
it
terribly
important
to
me
i
all
cut
up
about
something
that
has
happened
and
roberta
knew
by
her
friend
voice
that
something
had
occurred
to
trouble
him
greatly
and
so
she
said
wait
a
moment
ralph
i
will
talk
it
over
with
my
sister
lena
may
thought
the
plan
a
good
one
and
ralph
was
told
to
be
at
the
pensinger
mansion
in
hour
with
the
car
and
they
would
all
be
ready
and
waiting
for
him
lena
may
then
departed
to
the
rickety
tenement
to
get
the
wee
lad
oh
wilovich
the
girl
said
as
she
looked
about
the
small
hot
room
how
i
do
wish
that
you
would
go
with
us
today
do
you
feel
strong
enough
no
dearie
thanks
though
the
coughin
spell
was
usual
this
mornin
was
all
as
i
could
do
to
get
tony
breakfast
i
be
that
happy
knowin
as
the
little
fellow
seein
the
monkeys
his
heart
been
set
on
ever
since
the
picture
posters
was
up
on
the
fences
five
minutes
later
the
girl
and
the
little
boy
were
joined
by
the
young
bookseller
on
street
dean
lena
may
said
sadly
i
do
believe
that
wilovich
will
be
with
us
one
month
from
today
nor
do
i
the
lad
replied
then
he
added
as
he
looked
at
the
who
had
darted
ahead
but
who
looked
back
laughing
at
them
what
will
become
of
tony
i
going
to
keep
him
somehow
gloria
has
given
her
permission
i
wanted
to
be
sure
that
sister
thought
my
plan
wise
that
i
might
know
just
what
to
say
to
the
little
mother
when
she
speaks
of
it
to
me
as
she
will
in
time
no
wonder
was
it
that
the
lad
unspoken
love
for
the
girl
took
unto
itself
the
qualities
of
adoration
she
is
too
sweet
and
too
good
to
be
loved
by
a
useless
man
such
as
i
am
he
thought
and
how
he
wished
that
his
arm
might
be
freed
that
he
could
work
and
fight
the
world
for
this
angel
of
a
girl
a
surgeon
had
once
told
him
that
there
was
really
nothing
wrong
with
his
arm
it
had
grown
with
the
passing
years
but
was
stiffened
from
long
disuse
tony
was
wildly
excited
when
he
saw
the
big
green
car
in
which
he
was
to
ride
for
the
first
time
in
his
short
life
and
he
entertained
them
all
with
his
chatter
roberta
sitting
on
the
front
seat
with
her
friend
glanced
often
at
his
face
and
realized
that
although
he
too
joined
in
the
laughter
evoked
by
the
baby
prattle
his
thoughts
were
of
a
very
serious
nature
and
she
wondered
what
she
was
to
hear
when
they
two
were
alone
she
little
dreamed
that
ralph
was
to
say
something
that
would
greatly
affect
her
dean
carrying
the
basket
which
was
well
filled
with
picnic
refreshments
and
lena
may
leading
the
shining
eyed
waved
back
at
the
big
car
as
they
entered
the
side
gate
of
the
woodsy
bronx
park
bobs
smiled
as
the
baby
voice
wafted
to
them
ohee
see
funny
cow
they
were
near
the
buffalo
enclosure
then
ralph
started
the
engine
and
slowly
the
car
rolled
along
the
little
river
and
toward
the
country
roberta
knowing
that
something
was
greatly
troubling
her
friend
reached
out
a
hand
and
laid
it
sympathetically
upon
his
arm
instantly
his
left
hand
closed
over
hers
and
his
eyes
turned
toward
her
questioningly
bobs
he
said
you
been
a
trump
of
a
friend
to
me
i
not
going
to
try
to
tell
you
just
now
what
it
means
it
another
friend
i
want
to
talk
about
dick
dick
de
laney
you
remember
that
i
told
you
he
has
become
almost
as
dear
to
me
as
a
brother
since
desmond
died
i
was
sure
dick
would
do
anything
for
me
i
had
such
faith
in
his
loyalty
in
his
devoted
friendship
but
now
he
has
done
something
i
ca
understand
ralph
paused
and
his
companion
saw
that
he
was
greatly
affected
bobs
i
taking
this
awfully
hard
i
roberta
was
amazed
what
had
her
old
pal
dick
de
laney
done
to
so
hurt
her
new
friend
why
ralph
dear
she
said
for
he
had
turned
away
as
though
too
overcome
with
emotion
for
the
moment
to
go
on
with
his
story
what
has
dick
done
i
know
that
it
is
nothing
disloyal
or
dishonorable
you
do
know
dick
as
i
do
if
you
can
doubt
him
for
one
moment
he
would
do
what
he
believed
was
right
even
if
the
consequences
were
to
bring
real
suffering
to
him
he
been
that
way
ever
since
he
was
a
little
fellow
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
ralph
that
whatever
dick
has
done
his
motive
is
of
the
highest
now
tell
me
what
has
hurt
you
so
deeply
well
it
this
way
the
lad
began
i
missed
dick
terribly
more
of
course
before
i
met
you
but
i
have
been
looking
eagerly
forward
to
the
month
he
was
to
spend
with
me
in
the
orange
hills
i
did
tell
you
that
i
expected
him
to
arrive
today
i
wanted
to
surprise
you
but
instead
i
received
a
letter
on
the
early
morning
mail
and
it
informed
me
that
although
the
writer
really
did
love
me
as
though
i
were
his
brother
he
thought
it
best
not
to
visit
me
this
summer
instead
he
had
decided
to
travel
abroad
indefinitely
and
that
he
had
engaged
passage
on
a
steamer
that
leaves
hoboken
at
noon
today
what
can
it
mean
the
lad
turned
and
was
amazed
at
the
expression
in
the
face
of
the
girl
why
bobs
he
blurted
out
can
it
be
do
you
care
so
much
because
dick
is
going
away
oh
ralph
of
course
i
care
it
all
my
fault
i
knew
dick
loved
me
i
guess
i
always
known
it
and
last
april
when
he
was
home
for
the
spring
vacation
i
promised
him
that
oh
i
do
remember
just
what
i
did
promise
but
i
do
know
that
i
have
written
often
of
late
and
i
guess
he
thinks
i
do
care
any
more
and
maybe
that
why
he
going
away
but
i
do
care
and
oh
ralph
i
ca
let
him
go
without
telling
him
i
always
meant
to
tell
him
when
he
came
home
from
college
i
thought
we
were
too
young
to
be
really
engaged
until
then
dick
has
been
so
patient
waiting
all
these
years
and
loving
me
so
truly
and
so
loyally
ca
we
stop
him
or
at
least
ca
we
see
him
before
he
sails
the
expression
in
the
fine
face
of
the
lad
at
her
side
plainly
told
the
struggle
that
was
going
on
within
his
heart
so
after
all
dick
de
laney
had
been
as
loyal
as
a
brother
he
was
going
away
to
give
ralph
a
clear
field
well
it
was
ralph
turn
now
to
show
the
mettle
he
was
made
of
in
a
voice
that
might
have
betrayed
his
emotion
if
roberta
had
not
been
so
concerned
with
her
own
anxiety
and
regrets
he
said
of
course
bobs
we
will
try
to
reach
the
boat
before
it
sails
ferry
over
to
the
jersey
side
and
then
we
break
the
speed
limit
chapter
xxvi
a
happy
reunion
dick
de
laney
was
leaning
over
the
railing
of
the
big
liner
that
was
to
take
him
away
from
the
country
that
was
home
to
him
and
from
the
girl
he
loved
whose
happiness
meant
more
to
him
than
did
his
own
but
as
he
looked
out
over
the
choppy
waters
of
the
bay
and
toward
the
broad
atlantic
he
could
see
ahead
of
him
nothing
but
years
of
loneliness
then
it
was
that
he
heard
a
voice
that
was
eagerly
tremulously
calling
his
name
he
whirled
and
beheld
roberta
back
of
him
her
hands
outstretched
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
as
she
said
dick
why
did
you
do
it
why
did
you
plan
going
away
without
saying
even
if
you
have
changed
your
mind
even
if
you
do
care
for
me
any
more
it
is
like
you
to
just
run
away
dick
face
troubled
at
first
was
radiant
when
the
full
meaning
of
the
words
reached
his
consciousness
bobs
he
said
why
bobita
i
thought
you
did
care
that
is
i
thought
maybe
you
loved
ralph
and
so
and
so
you
were
going
away
to
let
me
have
someone
else
you
dear
old
stupid
to
think
that
i
so
nearly
lost
you
just
because
i
was
so
very
sure
that
you
loved
me
that
i
never
could
lose
you
and
so
i
write
about
it
these
two
were
holding
each
other
hands
and
looking
deep
into
each
other
eyes
entirely
oblivious
of
their
surroundings
roberta
continued
i
had
my
lesson
and
when
we
are
married
every
day
the
first
thing
instead
of
good
morning
i
am
going
to
say
i
love
you
which
after
all
will
mean
the
same
thing
married
bobs
when
are
we
to
be
married
the
girl
laughed
at
the
lad
eagerness
but
as
many
passengers
were
appearing
on
deck
she
replied
demurely
sometime
of
course
and
live
happily
ever
after
it
was
hard
for
dick
not
to
shout
but
instead
he
said
come
along
dear
and
i
cancel
my
passage
and
then
i
go
home
with
you
and
tell
you
what
all
this
means
to
me
i
ca
very
well
here
then
as
he
glanced
about
he
inquired
how
did
you
get
here
bobs
did
you
come
alone
no
ralph
brought
me
her
conscience
rebuked
her
for
she
had
completely
forgotten
the
existence
of
her
other
friend
he
was
as
hurt
as
i
was
because
you
were
going
away
without
seeing
him
she
told
dick
poor
old
ralph
was
all
he
said
i
certainly
am
sorry
for
him
but
i
suppose
it
ca
be
helped
sorry
for
ralph
why

of
surprised
inquiry
was
so
frank
that
the
lad
knew
his
pal
had
never
spoken
of
his
love
dick
was
even
more
puzzled
when
upon
reaching
the
dock
he
saw
his
friend
ralph
leap
toward
them
with
hands
outstretched
joyfully
he
exclaimed
great
i
know
by
your
radiant
faces
that
you
made
up
i
congratulate
you
both
i
certainly
am
glad
that
we
made
it
on
time
then
after
a
hearty
what
put
that
wild
notion
of
flight
into
your
head
old
man
you
ca
get
rid
of
us
that
easy
can
he
bobs
my
here
has
been
telling
me
that
she
has
been
engaged
to
you
ever
since
she
wore
pinafores
or
was
it
a
little
later
roberta
laughed
i
believe
i
had
on
a
riding
habit
that
day
did
i
dick
ralph
turned
away
after
a
fleeting
glance
at
the
girl
face
as
it
was
uplifted
to
his
roommate
he
had
not
dreamed
that
she
could
be
as
beautiful
as
that
expression
of
love
had
made
her
dick
was
replying
oh
it
does
much
matter
when
it
happened
dear
the
big
thing
is
that
it
did
happen
at
all
then
when
they
were
in
the
big
green
car
the
front
seat
was
wide
enough
to
hold
all
three
of
them
dick
began
to
ask
questions
how
is
gwen
now
was
the
first
of
them
he
was
pleased
to
hear
that
the
girl
but
a
year
roberta
senior
was
much
better
and
visiting
his
sister
phyllis
then
it
was
that
bobs
thought
of
something
why
ralph
she
said
you
never
did
have
an
opportunity
to
meet
my
beautiful
sister
gwendolyn
did
you
she
has
been
strong
enough
to
visit
with
strangers
and
now
she
has
gone
away
for
a
whole
month
dick
smiled
as
he
said
to
the
driver
bobs
is
giving
herself
a
compliment
when
she
calls
gwendolyn
beautiful
for
the
family
resemblance
between
the
two
girls
is
very
striking
roberta
laughed
i
should
say
that
it
must
be
dick
did
i
ever
write
you
about
the
time
a
stage
manager
thought
that
i
gwen
and
i
actually
had
to
do
a
song
and
dance
i
laugh
every
time
i
think
of
it
gloria
said
afterwards
that
it
was
a
natural
mistake
for
though
i
am
not
as
as
my
sister
we
do
look
very
much
the
same
ralph
smiled
but
he
made
no
response
his
thought
was
commenting
as
though
anyone
could
be
like
you
bobs
it
was
noon
when
the
pensinger
mansion
was
reached
and
roberta
told
the
lads
that
she
was
going
to
ask
them
in
just
then
as
she
had
to
do
some
writing
for
jewett
that
must
be
delivered
that
afternoon
but
she
invited
them
both
to
supper
if
they
were
afraid
to
eat
her
cooking
dick
said
he
certainly
would
reappear
as
soon
as
she
would
permit
him
to
come
but
ralph
had
an
engagement
with
his
dad
as
that
was
not
unusual
bobs
did
not
think
that
this
time
it
was
an
excuse
to
remain
away
as
indeed
it
was
roberta
turned
at
the
house
door
to
wave
to
the
lads
in
the
car
that
was
starting
away
vaguely
she
wondered
what
they
would
talk
about
how
little
she
knew
of
the
aching
heart
that
one
of
them
was
so
bravely
trying
to
hide
chapter
xxvii
revelations
that
do
not
reveal
the
two
lads
who
were
close
as
brothers
rode
for
some
time
in
silence
after
having
left
roberta
at
the
pensinger
mansion
it
took
skillful
driving
to
cross
the
crowded
streets
at
first
second
and
third
but
after
that
the
way
was
open
to
central
park
and
when
at
last
they
were
riding
down
one
of
the
wide
avenues
ralph
turned
his
gaze
from
the
road
and
smiled
at
his
friend
the
eyes
of
dick
were
searching
and
all
this
means
what
to
you
he
asked
earnestly
that
i
wrote
the
letter
to
which
you
are
referring
hastily
on
an
impulse
before
i
was
really
acquainted
with
miss
vandergrift
i
know
now
that
she
is
the
girl
for
me
and
i
also
know
that
she
the
girl
for
you
and
i
sincerely
congratulate
you
both
now
i
say
dick
you
are
going
to
spoil
my
plans
for
a
house
party
in
the
orange
hills
by
bolting
are
you
ma
mere
will
be
back
tomorrow
and
she
wrote
that
i
might
have
my
friends
for
a
week
as
soon
as
the
house
has
been
aired
out
you
know
it
has
been
closed
all
winter
indeed
i
not
going
anywhere
dick
felt
greatly
relieved
for
he
believed
that
ralph
was
telling
him
the
truth
he
knew
that
his
college
pal
was
impulsive
and
often
did
things
in
more
of
a
headlong
manner
than
he
would
had
he
given
the
matter
thought
of
course
he
admires
my
bobs
no
one
could
help
that
but
i
glad
that
he
does
really
love
her
dick
was
thinking
he
had
sorrow
enough
as
it
is
aloud
he
asked
who
are
you
going
to
ask
well
i
did
invite
all
four
of
the
vandergrift
girls
but
bobs
is
the
only
one
who
has
accepted
the
oldest
and
youngest
sisters
are
free
but
a
few
hours
each
day
the
rest
of
their
time
they
devote
to
settlement
work
and
they
feel
that
they
are
especially
needed
now
that
it
is
vacation
in
the
schools
gwendolyn
however
may
come
as
of
course
i
have
invited
your
sister
phyllis
and
her
guests
dick
looked
at
ralph
with
the
light
of
a
new
inspiration
in
his
eyes
i
say
would
it
be
great
if
you
could
care
for
my
sister
phyl
then
you
would
be
my
brother
in
very
truth
ralph
laughed
he
said
are
you
turning
matchmaker
too
late
for
that
old
man
bobs
tells
me
that
phyllis
is
engaged
to
a
fine
chap
from
up
boston
way
his
name
is
arden
wentworth
gee
that
great
news
arden
is
a
chap
after
my
own
heart
but
i
think
that
he
ever
could
win
phyl
she
must
have
changed
a
lot
this
last
year
why
how
that
ralph
looked
around
inquiringly
his
father
has
piled
up
a
few
millions
that
ought
to
please
any
girl
that
just
where
the
shoe
pinches
so
to
speak
was
the
reply
arden
being
a
young
american
refused
to
just
spend
his
money
and
so
he
put
on
overalls
and
began
at
the
bottom
in
one
of
his
dad
factories
he
said
he
wanted
to
prove
to
himself
even
if
the
world
did
care
that
he
had
brains
enough
to
make
good
without
help
phyl
would
speak
to
him
after
that
hoping
that
for
her
sake
he
would
give
it
up
but
he
did
and
so
i
thought
it
was
all
off
between
them
well
something
must
have
happened
for
bobs
tells
me
that
they
are
really
engaged
and
so
of
course
i
have
also
invited
arden
by
the
way
you
know
gwendolyn
vandergrift
what
kind
of
a
chap
ought
i
to
ask
for
her
harry
birch
is
in
town
i
thought
she
might
like
him
and
so
the
lads
talked
over
the
plans
for
the
coming
house
party
and
so
successfully
did
ralph
play
his
part
that
his
pal
did
not
for
one
moment
suspect
that
his
friend
was
secretly
wishing
that
he
might
have
sailed
away
in
dick
place
on
the
boat
which
that
noon
had
left
for
distant
shores
but
night
is
darkest
before
the
dawn
chapter
xxviii
the
house
party
ralph
and
dick
were
out
on
the
wide
velvety
lawn
which
surrounded
the
handsome
rambling
summer
home
of
the
the
gay
awnings
palms
and
boxes
of
flowers
gave
the
house
a
festive
appearance
while
the
many
colored
lanterns
strung
about
the
garden
suggested
that
some
merriment
was
planned
for
the
evening
who
seemed
very
young
to
be
the
mother
of
a
junior
member
of
an
ancient
law
firm
emerged
from
the
house
closely
followed
by
roberta
vandergrift
bobs
in
an
attractive
summer
dress
and
wide
hat
looked
very
different
from
the
girl
who
while
on
the
east
side
dressed
in
a
simple
dark
suit
and
a
neat
hat
are
your
guests
late
my
son
the
hostess
inquired
ralph
looked
at
his
watch
for
the
tenth
time
in
as
many
minutes
they
certainly
are
he
replied
late
by
a
full
hour
now
and
i
am
almost
inclined
to
think
that
they
had
a
breakdown
they
were
coming
in
jack
beardsley
tallyho
and
he
said
he
would
time
the
drive
from
new
york
so
that
they
would
reach
us
promptly
at
and
now
it
is
nearing
four
just
at
that
moment
a
butler
crossed
the
lawn
and
beckoning
ralph
to
one
side
told
him
that
someone
awaited
him
at
the
telephone
excusing
himself
the
lad
fairly
ran
indoors
as
he
had
expected
it
was
the
voice
of
his
friend
jack
beardsley
that
greeted
him
i
say
ralph
are
you
alone
so
that
no
one
will
get
wise
to
what
i
am
going
to
say
yes
was
the
reply
we
do
want
to
worry
her
sister
needlessly
there
really
is
no
cause
for
that
but
we
been
delayed
at
the
orange
hills
inn
because
gwendolyn
vandergrift
who
is
as
strong
as
she
thought
has
found
riding
in
the
tallyho
too
hard
she
got
grit
that
girl
has
never
complained
but
kept
up
as
long
as
she
could
that
she
need
not
trouble
anyone
until
she
just
keeled
over
and
fainted
she
better
now
and
phyllis
thought
that
if
you
would
come
over
after
her
with
that
little
runabout
of
yours
made
comfortable
with
blankets
and
pillows
it
would
be
as
hard
for
miss
vandergrift
as
this
old
tallyho
of
mine
buscom
the
innkeeper
wife
will
look
out
for
her
and
so
if
you
are
coming
we
start
along
as
i
want
to
make
the
steep
grade
with
this
lumbering
vehicle
of
mine
before
dark
sure
thing
i
get
there
all
right
i
take
a
short
cut
through
the
hills
so
you
wo
pass
me
but
do
be
alarmed
i
probably
get
back
here
in
the
whizz
as
soon
as
you
do
in
the
tallyho
so
i
wo
say
anything
to
her
sister
roberta
as
yet
so
long
again
ralph
was
acting
on
impulse
his
first
desire
had
been
to
take
bobs
with
him
but
if
he
did
there
would
not
be
room
to
make
the
invalid
sister
comfortable
on
the
return
trip
and
moreover
it
would
be
fair
to
dick
his
dad
would
arrive
with
the
big
car
until
and
so
the
whizz
would
have
to
do
sending
word
out
to
the
group
on
the
lawn
that
the
tallyho
had
been
delayed
but
would
soon
arrive
ralph
donned
his
leather
coat
cap
and
goggles
and
made
his
way
out
through
a
back
entrance
and
down
to
the
garage
soon
thereafter
he
was
speeding
over
a
country
road
which
led
among
the
hills
and
was
a
short
cut
of
many
miles
to
the
inn
he
broke
the
speed
limit
whenever
the
dirt
road
was
smooth
enough
to
permit
him
to
do
so
but
although
he
frightened
many
a
flock
of
birds
from
the
hedges
no
one
arose
from
the
wayside
tangle
to
bid
him
go
more
slowly
when
at
last
he
drew
up
at
the
inn
the
kind
buscom
appeared
and
smilingly
informed
him
that
the
young
lady
was
quite
rested
and
that
the
tallyho
had
been
gone
for
half
an
hour
she
was
about
to
lead
the
way
into
the
dim
parlor
of
the
inn
when
new
arrivals
delayed
her
and
so
ralph
went
in
alone
the
blinds
in
the
parlor
of
the
inn
were
drawn
and
having
come
in
from
the
dazzling
sunshine
ralph
at
first
could
scarcely
see
but
a
girl
who
had
been
seated
in
a
haircloth
rocker
arose
and
advanced
toward
him
she
wore
a
linen
hat
and
dress
for
a
moment
the
lad
paused
and
stared
as
though
at
an
apparition
bobs
he
ejaculated
then
he
laughed
as
he
extended
his
hand
miss
vandergrift
honestly
just
for
a
second
i
thought
that
i
was
seeing
a
vision
i
had
quite
forgotten
that
you
and
your
sister
so
closely
resemble
each
other
though
to
be
sure
you
are
taller
than
bobs
but
pardon
me
for
not
introducing
myself
i
am
ralph
cory
of
whom
perhaps
you
have
heard
and
i
am
gwendolyn
vandergrift
of
whom
i
am
sure
that
you
have
heard
else
you
would
not
have
come
for
me
the
girl
smiled
and
to
his
amazement
ralph
found
that
his
heart
was
pounding
like
a
if
you
are
sure
that
you
are
rested
miss
vandergrift
he
said
we
will
start
back
at
once
i
brought
soft
pillows
galore
and
a
jolly
soft
lap
robe
i
do
hope
you
be
comfortable
on
the
porch
of
the
inn
gwen
turned
and
holding
out
a
frail
hand
she
said
to
the
kindly
woman
thank
you
buscom
for
having
taken
such
good
care
of
me
i
shall
stop
again
on
our
way
back
to
town
the
bustling
little
woman
helped
arrange
the
pillows
and
tucked
in
the
blanket
then
to
ralph
she
said
as
the
machinery
started
do
take
care
of
the
pretty
dear
it
like
a
flower
she
is
and
ought
to
be
sheltered
from
the
rough
winds
of
the
world
i
do
that
little
thing
buscom
wish
us
luck
ralph
drove
slowly
at
first
but
gwen
said
i
so
well
packed
in
pillows
cory
it
wo
jar
me
in
the
least
if
you
go
faster
and
so
the
speed
increased
it
was
late
afternoon
and
the
highway
was
deserted
i
like
to
overtake
the
tallyho
ralph
remarked
if
i
thought
you
would
mind
the
pace
we
have
to
hit
gwendolyn
smiled
up
trustingly
i
have
perfect
faith
in
your
driving
she
said
i
know
you
will
take
care
of
me
ralph
looking
into
the
face
of
the
girl
at
his
side
again
had
the
strange
feeling
that
it
was
bobs
only
different
and
oh
what
was
the
matter
with
him
anyway
was
it
possible
that
he
liked
the
difference
bobs
had
always
been
a
frank
comrade
more
like
another
boy
when
he
came
to
think
of
it
but
this
girl
who
was
equally
beautiful
was
depending
upon
him
to
take
good
care
of
her
a
spurt
brought
them
to
the
top
of
a
hill
and
in
the
valley
below
they
saw
the
tallyho
ralph
stopped
a
brief
moment
on
the
plateau
leaped
out
to
be
sure
that
the
whizz
was
in
perfect
condition
and
then
anxiously
inquired
are
you
sure
you
game
loop
the
loop
wo
be
in
it
gwen
nodded
i
like
it
she
assured
him
the
color
had
mounted
to
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
sparkled
all
right
hold
fast
here
goes
then
the
whizz
went
like
a
red
streak
down
that
hill
on
which
as
ralph
had
observed
from
the
top
there
was
nothing
to
impede
their
progress
they
overtook
the
tallyho
and
slowed
up
that
they
need
not
startle
the
horses
they
had
reached
the
outer
boundaries
of
the
estate
suppose
i
get
back
in
the
tallyho
with
the
others
gwen
said
then
bobs
wo
know
that
i
had
a
fainting
spell
if
she
knew
it
she
would
feel
that
she
ought
to
take
me
right
home
and
i
do
want
to
go
her
smile
at
ralph
seemed
to
imply
that
he
was
her
i
not
going
to
let
you
go
he
heard
himself
saying
so
the
change
was
made
ralph
turned
the
whizz
into
a
rear
entrance
used
only
by
delivery
autos
and
in
that
way
reached
the
garage
he
had
asked
jack
beardsley
to
give
him
time
to
get
out
on
the
lawn
before
he
arrived
and
so
the
three
who
were
still
seated
around
a
tea
table
under
a
spreading
oak
saw
ralph
coming
from
the
house
at
the
same
time
that
the
tallyho
entered
the
front
gate
they
little
dreamed
of
all
that
had
happened
chapter
xxix
tragic
hours
and
now
while
these
young
people
are
having
a
happy
time
in
the
beautiful
orange
hill
country
let
us
return
to
the
east
side
that
is
sweltering
in
the
heat
of
late
june
it
was
nine
at
night
and
the
air
was
still
breathlessly
stifling
the
playground
that
edged
the
east
river
was
thronged
with
neighboring
folk
who
had
brought
what
portable
bedding
they
had
and
who
planned
sleeping
upon
the
ground
to
catch
some
possible
breeze
from
over
the
water
many
of
these
people
were
residents
of
the
rickety
tenement
across
from
the
model
apartments
but
one
there
was
who
had
been
unable
to
leave
the
small
hot
room
that
she
called
home
and
that
one
was
wilovich
she
was
not
alone
nor
had
she
been
for
all
that
day
lena
may
had
been
at
her
bedside
she
can
not
last
the
night
out
the
visiting
district
nurse
had
said
hast
she
any
own
folks
to
stay
with
her
till
it
all
over
i
shall
stay
little
lena
may
had
replied

think
you
ought

a
mere
girl
are
there
some
women
in
this
house
who
do
that
much
for
a
neighbor
i
am
seventeen
was
the
quiet
reply
and
wilovich
would
rather
have
me
she
never
made
friends
among
the
neighbors
well
as
you
wish
the
busy
nurse
had
said
i
have
many
more
places
to
visit
this
evening
so
i
ca
stay
and
anyway
there
nothing
to
do
but
to
let
her
hush
please
do
say
it
little
tony
might
hear
lena
may
had
implored
in
a
whisper
as
she
glanced
at
the
child
curled
up
on
the
floor
as
though
he
were
asleep
when
the
nurse
was
gone
dean
wiggin
appeared
in
the
open
doorway
as
he
had
many
times
that
day
and
evening
nell
had
been
called
to
the
country
to
see
about
the
small
farm
which
their
had
bequeathed
them
or
she
would
have
been
with
lena
may
gloria
had
left
at
eight
to
take
her
evening
classes
at
the
settlement
and
had
promised
to
return
at
ten
and
remain
with
her
sister
until
the
end
the
giant
of
a
lad
with
his
helpless
arm
that
was
always
held
in
one
position
as
it
had
been
in
slings
so
long
ago
glanced
first
at
the
woman
in
the
bed
and
then
at
the
girl
who
advanced
to
him
ca
i
stay
now
he
spoke
softly
i
closed
the
shop
and
the
office
is
there
anything
that
i
can
do
to
help
no
dean
i
do
need
you
and
there
is
room
but
i
do
wish
that
you
would
take
tony
out
of
doors
it
is
stifling
here
the
little
fellow
seemed
to
hear
his
name
he
rose
and
went
to
dean
the
lad
lifted
tony
with
his
strong
right
arm
i
take
him
down
to
the
docks
a
while
he
told
the
girl
put
a
light
in
the
window
if
you
want
me
lena
may
said
that
she
would
then
for
a
time
the
young
girl
stood
in
the
open
window
watching
the
moving
lights
out
on
the
river
at
last
she
turned
back
and
glanced
at
the
bed
the
mother
lay
so
quiet
and
so
white
that
lena
may
believed
that
she
had
passed
into
the
land
where
there
is
no
sweltering
crowded
east
side
she
was
right
the
tired
soul
had
taken
its
flight
the
girl
was
about
to
place
the
lamp
in
the
window
to
recall
dean
when
she
paused
and
listened
what
a
strange
roaring
sound
she
heard
and
how
intensely
hot
it
was
becoming
in
another
moment
there
was
a
wild
cry
of
fire
fire
from
the
playground
lena
may
sprang
to
the
open
door
she
knew
there
was
but
one
fire
escape
and
that
at
the
extreme
rear
of
the
long
dark
hallway
that
very
day
she
had
noticed
that
it
was
piled
high
with
rubbish
then
she
must
make
her
escape
by
the
narrow
rickety
front
stairs
down
the
top
flight
she
ran
only
to
find
that
the
flight
beneath
her
was
a
seething
mass
of
flame
she
darted
back
into
the
small
room
and
closed
the
door
then
she
ran
to
the
open
window
and
called
for
help
but
the
roaring
of
the
flames
drowned
her
voice
however
she
was
seen
and
several
firemen
ran
forward
with
a
ladder
but
a
rear
wall
crashed
in
and
they
leaped
back
at
that
moment
a
lad
darted
up
and
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
put
the
ladder
up
to
that
window
he
commanded
pointing
to
where
lena
may
pale
and
quiet
was
still
standing
by
heck
we
wo
it
sure
death
to
climb
up
there
the
wall
rocking
even
now
stand
back
everybody
the
chief
shouted
but
one
there
was
who
did
not
obey
with
superhuman
effort
he
lifted
the
ladder
several
men
seeing
that
he
was
determined
helped
him
place
it
then
ran
back
and
left
the
lad
to
scale
it
alone
never
before
had
dean
so
regretted
his
useless
arm
god
give
me
strength
he
cried
then
mounted
the
ladder
he
could
feel
it
sway
flames
leaped
from
the
windows
as
he
passed
he
caught
at
the
rounds
with
his
left
hand
as
well
as
his
right
and
up
up
he
went
the
girl
leaned
far
out

the
window

i
catch
you
the
lad
called
lena
may
did
as
she
was
told
and
clinging
to
the
top
round
with
his
left
hand
dean
clasped
the
girl
waist
with
his
strong
right
arm
and
climbed
down
as
fast
as
he
could
go
he
did
not
realize
that
he
was
using
his
left
arm
he
had
to
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
a
pain
like
that
made
by
a
hot
branding
iron
shot
through
his
shoulder
but
even
this
he
did
not
know
firemen
rushed
forward
and
took
the
girl
from
him
and
none
too
soon
for
with
a
terrific
roar
the
fire
burst
through
the
roof
which
caved
in
then
the
wall
tottered
and
crashed
down
about
them
where
that
boy
the
one
that
went
up
the
ladder
people
were
asking
on
all
sides
where
was

a
hero
rewarded
a
week
later
lena
may
was
in
the
sunny
kitchen
of
the
pensinger
mansion
making
broth
a
boy
was
sitting
on
the
floor
playing
contentedly
with
his
toys
he
had
been
told
that
his
mother
had
gone
to
a
beautiful
country
where
she
would
be
well
and
happy
and
that
some
day
he
would
see
her
again
muvver
likes
tony
to
stay
wiv
you
auntie
may
he
prattled
as
the
girl
stooped
to
kiss
him
then
as
he
suddenly
reached
up
his
chubby
arms
he
added
tony
likes
to
stay
wiv
you
there
now
the
broth
ready
and
tony
may
help
auntie
may
she
told
him
the
little
fellow
was
given
a
plate
of
crackers
and
the
girl
followed
with
a
bowl
of
steaming
refreshment
they
went
to
bobs
room
where
a
lad
was
lying
in
bed
once
again
dean
wiggin
had
fought
a
fire
for
the
sake
of
a
friend
but
this
time
had
undone
the
harm
that
had
been
done
in
the
long
ago
even
the
surgeon
who
had
been
called
in
declared
that
the
way
the
lad
had
wrenched
his
arm
free
and
had
actually
used
it
was
little
less
than
a
miracle
but
all
through
the
ages
people
who
with
a
high
purpose
have
called
upon
god
for
help
have
received
it
and
that
help
has
been
named
a
miracle
see
lena
may
the
lad
said
as
he
stretched
out
his
left
arm
it
moves
does
it
stiffly
perhaps
but
i
must
keep
it
going
the
doctor
told
me
then
he
drew
himself
into
a
sitting
position
and
the
girl
raised
the
pillows
to
make
him
comfortable
he
smiled
at
her
beamingly
as
he
said
another
bit
of
good
news
is
that
tomorrow
i
may
get
up
just
because
one
wall
of
a
burning
tenement
fell
on
me
is
no
reason
why
i
should
remain
in
bed
longer
than
one
week
and
be
waited
upon
you
surely
had
a
wonderful
escape
dean
the
girl
said
as
she
gave
him
the
broth
just
by
chance
the
firemen
instantly
turned
the
water
where
you
had
fallen
and
so
you
were
burned
nor
drowned
the
lad
said
merrily
just
knocked
senseless
then
after
a
moment
pause
he
continued
i
want
to
be
up
and
about
before
nell
returns
she
will
be
in
about
noon
tomorrow
unless
it
got
into
the
new
england
papers
which
is
likely
she
wo
know
a
thing
about
it
i
do
want
her
to
hear
of
it
before
i
tell
her
she
would
imagine
all
sorts
of
things
that
are
true
and
be
needlessly
worried
how
glad
your
sister
will
be
when
she
finds
that
the
use
of
your
arm
has
been
restored
to
you
lena
may
sat
by
the
bedside
holding
tony
on
her
lap
wo
she
dean
upward
glance
was
radiant
no
longer
will
i
have
to
follow
the
profession
of
old
i
want
to
do
something
that
will
keep
that
arm
constantly
busy
what
dean
have
you
thought
yes
indeed
you
wo
think
it
a
very
wonderful
ambition
i
want
to
be
a
farmer
i
do
like
this
crowded
city
i
feel
as
though
i
breathe
when
i
am
lying
here
alone
i
keep
thinking
of
the
new
england
farm
where
my
boyhood
was
spent
and
i
long
to
really
work
in
that
rocky
soil
standing
up
now
and
then
to
breathe
deep
of
that
sparkling
air
and
to
gaze
at
that
wide
view
over
the
and
the
shining
curving
silver
ribbon
that
is
really
a
river
to
the
distant
mountains
lena
may
how
i
wish
you
could
see
it
with
me
i
am
sure
that
i
would
love
it
the
girl
said
then
rising
she
added
here
comes
gloria
and
hardinian
they
are
going
to
hear
some
hungarian
music
tonight
and
i
promised
to
have
an
early
supper
for
them
tony
may
stay
with
you
i
am
sure
he
would
like
to
hear
a
story
about
the
little
wild
creatures
who
live
on
your
farm
but
when
the
girl
was
gone
the
little
fellow
accommodatingly
curled
up
by
dean
side
and
went
to
sleep
and
so
the
lad
thoughts
were
left
free
to
dream
of
a
wonderful
something
that
might
happen
some
day
on
that

have
things
been
happening
with
a
whirl
of
late
bobs
exclaimed
as
she
passed
a
plate
of
hot
muffins
i
feel
dizzy
honestly
i
do
i
so
proud
of
dick
she
added
as
she
sank
into
her
own
place
at
the
table
all
of
his
own
accord
he
told
me
that
he
going
back
for
one
more
year
at
law
school
and
then
he
and
ralph
are
going
to
hang
out
a
shingle
for
themselves
they
going
to
start
a
new
firm
and
be
partners
judge
thinks
that
his
son
must
be
crazy
when
he
is
already
a
junior
member
of
an
old
and
well
established
firm
they
got
the
idea
from
arden
wentworth
i
suppose
he
has
made
good
by
himself
and
the
plan
rather
appeals
to
dick
and
ralph
they
great
pals
are
they
these
two
brothers
could
care
more
for
each
other
i
do
believe
lena
may
said
as
she
buttered
a
muffin
for
her
little
charge
and
to
think
that
they
are
to
marry
sisters
in
the
dim
and
distant
future
that
ought
to
cement
the
brotherly
ties
even
closer
than
ever
gloria
remarked
as
she
smiled
at
gwendolyn
who
and
looked
as
though
she
had
never
been
gwen
you
and
ralph
fell
in
love
rather
suddenly
did
you
lena
may
inquired
maybe
so
her
sister
replied
ralph
says
that
he
has
always
felt
sure
that
he
would
know
the
girl
who
was
meant
for
him
the
very
moment
that
he
saw
her
and
he
insists
that
he
loved
me
the
minute
he
met
me
at
orange
hills
inn
roberta
leaned
over
and
placed
her
hand
on
that
of
her
sister
i
so
glad
she
said
for
i
do
believe
that
ralph
is
almost
as
fine
a
chap
as
my
dick
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
and
to
think
that
if
it
been
for
the
pensinger
mystery
we
might
never
have
met
him
by
the
way
gloria
remarked
what
has
become
of
the
pensinger
mystery
roberta
laughed
as
she
arose
to
replenish
the
muffin
plate
from
the
oven
i
afraid
it
is
destined
to
always
remain
a
mystery
ralph
and
i
followed
every
clue
we
could
possibly
think
of
it
a
shame
is
it
not
to
have
this
old
place
owned
by
someone
to
say
nothing
of
the
money
after
a
moment
silence
gloria
asked
lena
may
was
there
any
news
of
general
interest
in
dean
letter
this
morning
their
youngest
sister
smiled
brightly
oh
yes
indeed
he
was
so
glad
to
get
back
to
that
new
england
farm
where
he
can
breathe
he
said
that
there
are
wonderful
possibilities
in
the
old
house
and
that
he
is
going
to
begin
work
on
it
at
once
he
hopes
that
by
the
time
i
am
eighteen
it
will
look
like
a
real
home
but
there
was
another
item
in
the
letter
that
i
am
sure
you
will
all
be
glad
to
hear
his
group
of
nature
poems
has
been
accepted
by
a
magazine
called
new
england
and
the
check
they
sent
seems
like
a
real
fortune
to
dean
the
best
of
it
is
they
have
asked
for
more
great
i
for
one
shall
be
most
proud
to
have
a
poet
for
a
then
to
lena
may
maybe
you
thought
you
were
keeping
it
a
secret
from
us
little
one
but
you
were
and
we
glad
just
as
glad
as
we
can
be
their
youngest
looked
up
at
the
oldest
sister
who
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
then
she
said
of
course
i
had
told
glow
because
she
is
mother
to
us
but
after
that
letter
from
dean
this
morning
i
want
to
tell
you
all
then
merrily
bobs
exclaimed
now
gloria
we
all
up
but
you
are
you
and
hardinian
going
to
be
married
some
day
and
live
happily
ever
after
i
never
knew
two
people
who
seemed
better
suited
for
each
other
gwendolyn
commented
gloria
smiled
and
what
would
you
have
us
live
on
dear
you
know
that
it
takes
hardinian
entire
income
to
pay
the
expenses
of
his
club
of
course
the
little
chaps
pay
five
cents
a
night
for
a
bunk
when
they
have
work
but
he
has
to
loan
money
to
others
who
are
out
of
work
who
might
take
to
stealing
if
they
had
no
other
way
to
procure
food
however
they
have
never
failed
to
pay
him
back
when
they
did
get
work
their
oldest
sister
enthusiastic
praise
of
the
welfare
worker
told
how
great
was
her
admiration
for
that
truly
noble
young
man
if
nothing
more
crickets
what
was
that
bobs
suddenly
exclaimed
only
the
telephone
my
dear
lena
may
remarked
bobsy
will
you
answer
it
three
minutes
later
that
girl
fairly
plunged
back
into
the
kitchen
her
shining
eyes
assuring
them
that
she
had
heard
something
of
an
astonishing
nature
it
was
ralph
she
exclaimed
as
she
sank
down
into
the
nearest
chair
the
mystery
is
solved
solved
her
sisters
repeated
inquiringly
and
all
at
once
how
when
who
is
the
heir
roberta
laughed
well
here
where
i
resign
as
a
detective
she
declared
i
had
three
cases
and
although
each
one
has
been
successfully
solved
in
spite
of
me
it
has
not
been
because
of
any
cleverness
on
my
part
but
bobs
do
tell
us
what
ralph
said
we
bursting
with
curiosity
my
feels
as
chagrined
about
it
as
i
do
for
the
solution
of
the
mystery
just
turned
up
we
neither
of
us
ferreted
it
out
as
we
had
hoped
that
we
would
bobita
you
just
trying
to
tantalize
us
gwen
declared
do
tell
us
from
the
beginning
very
well
then
i
will
ralph
said
that
his
dad
happened
to
recall
recently
something
which
his
father
had
once
told
him
you
know
it
was
ralph
grandfather
who
was
the
intimate
friend
and
legal
advisor
of
pensinger
it
seems
that
a
week
before
his
death
pensinger
had
sent
some
important
papers
and
a
letter
to
the
office
of
the
grandfather
you
understand
just
as
he
was
about
to
examine
them
he
was
called
away
on
urgent
business
and
he
left
the
papers
on
his
desk
expecting
to
return
soon
the
cory
building
was
even
then
in
the
process
of
construction
but
ralph
grandfather
had
moved
in
before
it
was
quite
completed
that
day
the
floor
was
being
put
down
in
the
room
adjoining
the
small
office
later
when
returned
his
mind
was
so
filled
with
the
intricacies
of
the
new
case
which
had
just
been
given
to
him
that
he
did
not
even
notice
that
the
brown
packet
containing
the
pensinger
papers
was
gone
in
fact
he
had
forgotten
that
it
ever
existed
but
a
week
later
when
he
received
word
that
his
friend
pensinger
had
died
suddenly
he
recalled
the
papers
and
began
to
search
for
them
but
they
were
never
found
oh
i
know
where
they
were
lena
may
said
brightly
under
the
floor
bobs
nodded
her
eyes
glowing
that
just
it
she
affirmed
recently
judge
said
to
ralph
we
will
have
to
tear
down
this
old
building
of
ours
or
we
will
have
to
renovate
it
and
bring
it
up
to
date
ralph
is
romantic
enough
to
want
to
retain
the
atmosphere
of
the
days
of
his
grandfather
and
so
he
favored
the
latter
plan
soon
carpenters
were
tearing
up
the
office
floors
to
replace
them
with
hard
wood
and
the
packet
was
found
and
in
those
papers
had
pensinger
made
some
different
disposition
of
his
property
gloria
inquired
bobs
nodded
yes
she
said
it
seems
that
pensinger
after
his
wife
death
visited
hungary
found
his
daughter
marilyn
who
lived
but
a
short
time
and
so
as
he
was
without
an
heir
he
had
written
requesting
him
to
use
the
pensinger
fortune
wherever
he
thought
it
would
be
most
needed
what
will
become
of
this
house
lena
may
inquired
ralph
did
say
he
wants
to
tell
that
himself
in
fact
he
said
that
he
was
coming
right
up
in
the
whizz
and
that
he
was
coming
alone
either
i
suppose
that
dick
de
laney
will
be
with
him
gloria
remarked
as
she
cleared
the
table
we
are
going
to
be
kept
long
in
suspense
gwendolyn
said
for
the
whizz
just
passed
the
window
and
there
the
knocker
shall
i
go
to
the
door
before
her
sisters
could
reply
that
maiden
was
down
the
long
hall
and
a
second
later
she
reappeared
with
ralph
at
her
side
two
other
young
men
followed
closely
one
indeed
was
dick
de
laney
and
the
other
was
hardinian
his
dark
expressive
eyes
showed
that
he
was
much
mystified
by
all
that
was
happening
shall
we
go
into
the
salon
gloria
inquired
when
greetings
were
over
no
indeed
this
corner
with
its
cheerful
grate
fire
is
the
pleasantest
part
of
the
old
house
ralph
declared
dick
help
me
bring
in
another
chair
or
two
now
sit
down
everybody
and
i
tell
you
the
results
of
my
conference
with
my
father
ralph
was
plainly
elated
about
something
which
as
yet
he
had
revealed
to
no
one
when
they
were
seated
he
turned
at
once
to
the
tall
dark
hungarian
hardinian
you
were
telling
me
last
week
that
your
temporary
wooden
building
for
the
boys
club
is
to
be
torn
down
next
month
that
a
tobacco
factory
may
be
erected
were
you
not
yes
was
the
reply
of
the
still
puzzled
young
man
i
ca
imagine
where
i
am
to
take
my
boys
i
do
like
to
have
them
bunkless
even
for
one
night
of
course
not
nor
shall
they
be
ralph
continued
then
he
looked
at
the
girls
beamingly
not
if
these
young
ladies
will
consent
to
having
a
model
clubhouse
erected
in
the
old
garden
back
of
their
mansion
ralph
how
wonderful
that
would
be
gloria
exclaimed
but
what
do
you
mean
just
what
i
say
the
lad
replied
the
former
owner
of
this
place
wanted
his
fortune
used
for
some
good
cause
and
dad
and
i
thought
that
it
would
be
great
to
help
hardinian
carry
on
his
fine
work
right
here
on
this
very
spot
as
a
sort
of
memorial
and
could
it
be
called
the
pensinger
boys
club
or
something
like
that
indeed
it
could
hardinian
dark
eyes
expressed
his
appreciation
more
than
words
could
have
done
then
to
the
tall
girl
at
his
side
he
said
now
many
of
our
for
the
boys
can
be
made
a
reality
turning
to
the
others
he
continued
i
am
sure
that
gloria
is
now
willing
that
i
should
tell
you
that
she
had
consented
to
some
day
mother
all
of
our
boys
and
because
of
this
splendid
new
plan
i
hope
that
the
may
be
very
soon
and
it
was
indeed
before
another
year
had
passed
each
of
the
girls
was
in
a
home
of
her
own
transcriber
note
obvious
typographical
errors
were
corrected
without
comment
inconsistent
proper
names
were
made
consistent
spellings
and
dialect
were
left
unchanged
