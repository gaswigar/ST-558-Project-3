introduction
i
we
travel
rapidly
in
these
historical
sketches
the
reader
flies
in
his
express
train
in
a
few
minutes
through
a
couple
of
centuries
the
centuries
pass
more
slowly
to
those
to
whom
the
years
are
doled
out
day
by
day
institutions
grow
and
beneficently
develop
themselves
making
their
way
into
the
hearts
of
generations
which
are
than
they
attracting
love
and
respect
and
winning
loyal
obedience
and
then
as
gradually
forfeiting
by
their
shortcomings
the
allegiance
which
had
been
honorably
gained
in
worthier
periods
we
see
wealth
and
greatness
we
see
corruption
and
vice
and
one
seems
to
follow
so
close
upon
the
other
that
we
fancy
they
must
have
always
we
look
more
steadily
and
we
perceive
long
periods
of
time
in
which
there
is
first
a
growth
and
then
a
decay
like
what
we
perceive
in
a
tree
of
the
forest
froude
of
an
english
monasticism
record
in
the
philippines
presents
no
new
general
fact
to
the
eye
of
history
the
attempt
to
eliminate
the
eternal
feminine
from
her
natural
and
normal
sphere
in
the
scheme
of
things
there
met
with
the
same
certain
and
signal
disaster
that
awaits
every
perversion
of
human
activity
beginning
with
a
band
of
zealous
earnest
men
sincere
in
their
convictions
to
whom
the
cause
was
all
and
their
personalities
nothing
it
there
as
elsewhere
passed
through
its
usual
cycle
of
usefulness
stagnation
corruption
and
degeneration
to
the
unselfish
and
heroic
efforts
of
the
early
friars
spain
in
large
measure
owed
her
dominion
over
the
philippine
islands
and
the
filipinos
a
marked
advance
on
the
road
to
civilization
and
nationality
in
fact
after
the
dreams
of
sudden
wealth
from
gold
and
spices
had
faded
the
islands
were
retained
chiefly
as
a
missionary
conquest
and
a
to
the
broader
fields
of
asia
with
manila
as
a
depot
for
the
oriental
trade
the
records
of
those
early
years
are
filled
with
tales
of
courage
and
heroism
worthy
of
proudest
years
as
the
missionary
fathers
labored
with
unflagging
zeal
in
disinterested
endeavor
for
the
spread
of
the
faith
and
the
betterment
of
the
condition
of
the
malays
among
whom
they
found
themselves
they
won
the
confidence
of
the
native
peoples
gathered
them
into
settlements
and
villages
led
them
into
the
ways
of
peace
and
became
their
protectors
guides
and
counselors
in
those
times
the
cross
and
the
sword
went
hand
in
hand
but
in
the
philippines
the
latter
was
rarely
needed
or
used
the
lightness
and
vivacity
of
the
spanish
character
with
its
strain
of
orientalism
its
fertility
of
resource
in
meeting
new
conditions
its
adaptability
in
dealing
with
the
dwellers
in
warmer
lands
all
played
their
part
in
this
as
in
the
other
conquests
only
on
occasions
when
some
stubborn
resistance
was
met
with
as
in
manila
and
the
surrounding
country
where
the
most
advanced
of
the
native
peoples
dwelt
and
where
some
of
the
forms
and
beliefs
of
islam
had
been
established
was
it
necessary
to
resort
to
violence
to
destroy
the
native
leaders
and
replace
them
with
the
missionary
fathers
a
few
sallies
by
young
salcedo
the
cortez
of
the
philippine
conquest
with
a
company
of
the
splendid
infantry
which
was
at
that
time
the
admiration
and
despair
of
martial
europe
soon
effectively
exorcised
any
idea
of
resistance
that
even
the
boldest
and
most
intransigent
of
the
native
leaders
might
have
entertained
for
the
most
part
no
great
persuasion
was
needed
to
turn
a
simple
imaginative
fatalistic
people
from
a
few
vague
animistic
deities
to
the
systematic
iconology
and
the
elaborate
ritual
of
the
spanish
church
an
obscure
or
a
dim
was
easily
superseded
by
or
transformed
into
a
clearly
defined
and
in
the
case
of
any
especially
tenacious
demon
he
could
without
much
difficulty
be
merged
into
a
christian
saint
or
devil
there
was
no
organized
priesthood
to
be
overcome
the
primitive
religious
observances
consisting
almost
entirely
of
occasional
orgies
presided
over
by
an
old
woman
who
filled
the
priestly
offices
of
interpreter
for
the
unseen
powers
and
chief
eater
at
the
sacrificial
feast
with
their
unflagging
zeal
their
organization
their
elaborate
forms
and
ceremonies
the
missionaries
were
enabled
to
win
the
confidence
of
the
natives
especially
as
the
greater
part
of
them
learned
the
local
language
and
identified
their
lives
with
the
communities
under
their
care
accordingly
the
people
took
kindly
to
their
new
teachers
and
rulers
so
that
in
less
than
a
generation
spanish
authority
was
generally
recognized
in
the
settled
portions
of
the
philippines
and
in
the
succeeding
years
the
missionaries
gradually
extended
this
area
by
forming
settlements
from
among
the
wilder
peoples
whom
they
persuaded
to
abandon
the
more
objectionable
features
of
their
old
roving
often
predatory
life
and
to
group
themselves
into
towns
and
villages
under
the
bell
the
tactics
employed
in
the
conquest
and
the
subsequent
behavior
of
the
conquerors
were
true
to
the
old
spanish
nature
so
succinctly
characterized
by
a
englishman
of
mary
reign
when
the
of
castile
encircled
the
globe
and
even
hovered
ominously
near
the
sceptered
isle
when
in
the
intoxication
of
power
character
stands
out
so
sharply
defined
they
be
verye
wyse
and
politicke
and
can
thorowe
ther
wysdome

and
brydell
theyr
owne
natures
for
a
tyme
and
applye
ther
conditions
to
the
manners
of
those
men
with
whom
they
meddell

by

whose
mischievous
maners

but
then
shall

for
in

untyll
they
have
ther
purposes
and
afterwards
in
oppression
and
tyrannye
when
they
can
obtain
them
they
do
exceed
all
other
nations
upon
the
earthe
in
the
working
out
of
this
spirit
with
all
the
indomitable
courage
and
fanatical
ardor
derived
from
the
long
contests
with
the
moors
they
reduced
the
native
peoples
to
submission
but
still
not
to
the
galling
yoke
which
they
fastened
upon
the
aborigines
of
america
to
make
one
las
casas
shine
amid
the
horde
of
pizarros
there
was
some
compulsory
labor
in
and
with
enforced
military
service
as
rowers
and
soldiers
for
expeditions
to
the
moluccas
and
the
coasts
of
asia
but
nowhere
the
unspeakable
atrocities
which
in
mexico
hispaniola
and
south
america
drove
mothers
to
strangle
their
babes
at
birth
and
whole
tribes
to
prefer
to
the
living
death
in
the
mines
and
quite
differently
from
the
case
in
america
where
entire
islands
and
districts
were
depopulated
to
bring
on
later
the
curse
of
negro
slavery
in
the
philippines
the
fact
appears
that
the
native
population
really
increased
and
the
standard
of
living
was
raised
under
the
stern
yet
beneficent
tutelage
of
the
missionary
fathers
the
great
distance
and
the
hardships
of
the
journey
precluded
the
coming
of
many
irresponsible
adventurers
from
spain
and
fortunately
for
the
native
population
no
great
mineral
wealth
was
ever
discovered
in
the
philippine
islands
the
system
of
government
was
in
its
essential
features
a
simple
one
the
missionary
priests
drew
the
inhabitants
of
the
towns
and
villages
about
themselves
or
formed
new
settlements
and
with
profuse
use
of
symbol
and
symbolism
taught
the
people
the
faith
laying
particular
stress
upon
the
fear
of
god
as
administered
by
them
reconciling
the
people
to
their
subjection
by
inculcating
the
christian
virtues
of
patience
and
humility
when
any
recalcitrants
refused
to
accept
the
new
order
or
later
showed
an
inclination
to
break
away
from
it
the
military
forces
acting
usually
under
secret
directions
from
the
padre
made
raids
in
the
disaffected
parts
with
all
the
unpitying
atrocity
the
spanish
soldiery
were
ever
capable
of
displaying
in
their
dealings
with
a
weaker
people
after
sufficient
punishment
had
been
inflicted
and
a
wholesome
fear
inspired
the
padre
very
opportunely
interfered
in
the
natives
behalf
by
which
means
they
were
convinced
that
peace
and
security
lay
in
submission
to
the
authorities
especially
to
the
curate
of
their
town
or
district
a
single
example
will
suffice
to
make
the
method
clear
not
an
isolated
instance
but
a
typical
case
chosen
from
among
the
mass
of
records
left
by
the
chief
actors
themselves
fray
domingo
perez
evidently
a
man
of
courage
and
conviction
for
he
later
lost
his
life
in
the
work
of
which
he
wrote
was
the
dominican
vicar
on
the
zambales
coast
when
that
order
temporarily
took
over
the
district
from
the
recollects
in
a
report
written
for
his
superior
in
he
outlines
the
method
clearly
in
order
that
those
whom
we
have
assembled
in
the
three
villages
may
persevere
in
their
settlements
the
most
efficacious
fear
and
the
one
most
suited
to
their
nature
is
that
the
spaniards
of
the
fort
and
presidio
of
paynaven
of
whom
they
have
a
very
great
fear
may
come
very
often
to
the
said
villages
and
overrun
the
land
and
penetrate
even
into
their
old
recesses
where
they
formerly
lived
and
if
perchance
they
should
find
anything
planted
in
the
said
recesses
that
they
would
destroy
it
and
cut
it
down
without
leaving
them
anything
and
so
that
they
may
see
the
father
protects
them
when
the
said
spaniards
come
to
the
village
the
father
opposes
them
and
takes
the
part
of
the
indians
but
it
is
always
necessary
in
this
matter
for
the
soldiers
to
conquer
and
the
father
is
always
very
careful
always
to
inform
the
spaniards
by
whom
and
where
anything
is
planted
which
it
may
be
necessary
to
destroy
and
that
the
edicts
which
his
lordship
the
governor
sent
them
be
carried
out
but
at
all
events
said
spaniards
are
to
make
no
trouble
for
the
indians
whom
they
find
in
the
villages
but
rather
must
treat
them
well
this
in
the
dominican
transcriber
of
the
record
in
has
added
a
very
illuminating
note
revealing
the
immutability
of
the
system
and
showing
that
the
rulers
possessed
in
a
superlative
degree
the
bourbonesque
trait
of
learning
nothing
and
forgetting
nothing
even
when
i
was
a
missionary
to
the
heathens
from
to
i
had
occasion
to
observe
the
said
policy
to
inform
the
chief
of
the
fortress
of
the
measures
that
he
ought
to
take
and
to
make
a
false
show
on
the
other
side
so
that
it
might
have
no
influence
on
the
fortress
thus
it
stands
out
in
bold
relief
as
a
system
built
up
and
maintained
by
fraud
and
force
bound
in
the
course
of
nature
to
last
only
as
long
as
the
deception
could
be
carried
on
and
the
repressive
force
kept
up
to
sufficient
strength
its
maintenance
required
that
the
different
sections
be
isolated
from
each
other
so
that
there
could
be
no
growth
toward
a
common
understanding
and
coöperation
and
its
permanence
depended
upon
keeping
the
people
ignorant
and
contented
with
their
lot
held
under
strict
control
by
religious
and
political
fear
yet
it
was
a
vast
improvement
over
their
old
mode
of
life
and
their
condition
was
bettered
as
they
grew
up
to
such
a
system
only
with
the
passing
of
the
years
and
the
increase
of
wealth
and
influence
the
ease
and
luxury
invited
by
these
and
the
consequent
corruption
so
induced
with
the
insatiable
longing
ever
for
more
wealth
and
greater
influence
did
the
poison
of
greed
and
grasping
power
enter
the
system
to
work
its
insidious
way
into
every
part
slowly
transforming
the
beneficent
institution
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
into
an
incubus
weighing
upon
all
the
activities
of
the
people
in
the
nineteenth
an
unyielding
bar
to
the
development
of
the
country
a
hideous
anachronism
in
these
modern
times
it
must
be
remembered
also
that
spain
in
the
years
following
her
brilliant
conquests
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
lost
strength
and
vigor
through
the
corruption
at
home
induced
by
the
unearned
wealth
that
flowed
into
the
mother
country
from
the
colonies
and
by
the
draining
away
of
her
best
blood
nor
did
her
sons
ever
develop
that
economic
spirit
which
is
the
permanent
foundation
of
all
empire
but
they
let
the
wealth
of
the
indies
flow
through
their
country
principally
to
london
and
amsterdam
there
to
form
in
more
practical
hands
the
basis
of
the
british
and
dutch
colonial
empires
the
priest
and
the
soldier
were
supreme
so
her
best
sons
took
up
either
the
cross
or
the
sword
to
maintain
her
dominion
in
the
distant
colonies
a
movement
which
long
continued
spelled
for
her
a
form
of
national
suicide
the
soldier
expended
his
strength
and
generally
laid
down
his
life
on
alien
soil
leaving
no
fit
successor
of
his
own
stock
to
carry
on
the
work
according
to
his
standards
the
priest
under
the
celibate
system
in
its
better
days
left
no
offspring
at
all
and
in
the
days
of
its
corruption
none
bred
and
reared
under
the
influences
that
make
for
social
and
political
progress
the
dark
chambers
of
the
inquisition
stifled
all
advance
in
thought
so
the
civilization
and
the
culture
of
spain
as
well
as
her
political
system
settled
into
rigid
forms
to
await
only
the
inevitable
process
of
stagnation
and
decay
in
her
proudest
hour
an
old
soldier
who
had
lost
one
of
his
hands
fighting
her
battles
against
the
turk
at
lepanto
employed
the
other
in
writing
the
masterpiece
of
her
literature
which
is
really
a
caricature
of
the
nation
there
is
much
in
the
career
of
spain
that
calls
to
mind
the
dazzling
beauty
of
her
daughters
with
its
early
bloom
its
startling
almost
morbid
brilliance
and
its
premature
decay
rapid
and
brilliant
was
her
rise
gradual
and
inglorious
her
steady
decline
from
the
bright
morning
when
the
banners
of
castile
and
aragon
were
flung
triumphantly
from
the
battlements
of
the
alhambra
to
the
short
summer
not
so
long
gone
when
at
cavite
and
santiago
with
swift
decisive
havoc
the
last
ragged
remnants
of
the
once
power
were
blown
into
space
and
time
to
hover
disembodied
there
a
lesson
and
a
warning
to
future
generations
whatever
her
final
place
in
the
records
of
mankind
whether
as
the
pioneer
of
modern
civilization
or
the
buccaneer
of
the
nations
or
as
would
seem
most
likely
a
goodly
mixture
of
both
she
has
at
least
with
the
exception
only
of
her
great
mother
rome
furnished
the
most
instructive
lessons
in
political
pathology
yet
recorded
and
the
advice
to
students
of
world
progress
to
familiarize
themselves
with
her
history
is
even
more
apt
today
than
when
it
first
issued
from
the
encyclopedic
mind
of
macaulay
nearly
a
century
ago
hardly
had
she
reached
the
zenith
of
her
power
when
the
disintegration
began
and
one
by
one
her
brilliant
conquests
dropped
away
to
leave
her
alone
in
her
faded
splendor
with
naught
but
her
vaunting
pride
left
another
niobe
of
nations
in
the
countries
more
in
contact
with
the
trend
of
civilization
and
more
susceptible
to
revolutionary
influences
from
the
mother
country
this
separation
came
from
within
while
in
the
remoter
parts
the
archaic
and
outgrown
system
dragged
along
until
a
stronger
force
from
without
destroyed
it
nowhere
was
the
crystallization
of
form
and
principle
more
pronounced
than
in
religious
life
which
fastened
upon
the
mother
country
a
deadening
weight
that
hampered
all
progress
and
in
the
colonies
notably
in
the
philippines
virtually
converted
her
government
into
a
hagiarchy
that
had
its
face
toward
the
past
and
either
could
not
or
would
not
move
with
the
current
of
the
times
so
when
the
shot
heard
round
the
world
the
declaration
of
humanity
right
to
be
and
to
become
in
its
sweep
reached
the
lands
controlled
by
her
it
was
coldly
received
and
blindly
rejected
by
the
governing
powers
and
there
was
left
only
the
slower
subtler
but
none
the
less
sure
process
of
working
its
way
among
the
people
to
burst
in
time
in
rebellion
and
the
destruction
of
the
conservative
forces
that
would
repress
it
in
the
opening
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
friar
orders
in
the
philippines
had
reached
the
apogee
of
their
power
and
usefulness
their
influence
was
everywhere
felt
and
acknowledged
while
the
country
still
prospered
under
the
effects
of
the
vigorous
and
progressive
administrations
of
anda
and
vargas
in
the
preceding
century
native
levies
had
fought
loyally
under
spanish
leadership
against
dutch
and
british
invaders
or
in
suppressing
local
revolts
among
their
own
people
which
were
always
due
to
some
specific
grievance
never
directed
definitely
against
the
spanish
sovereignty
the
philippines
were
shut
off
from
contact
with
any
country
but
spain
and
even
this
communication
was
restricted
and
carefully
guarded
there
was
an
elaborate
central
government
which
however
hardly
touched
the
life
of
the
native
peoples
who
were
guided
and
governed
by
the
parish
priests
each
town
being
in
a
way
an
independent
entity
of
this
halcyon
period
just
before
the
process
of
disintegration
began
there
has
fortunately
been
left
a
record
which
may
be
characterized
as
the
most
notable
spanish
literary
production
relating
to
the
philippines
being
the
calm
sympathetic
judicial
account
of
one
who
had
spent
his
manhood
in
the
work
there
and
who
full
of
years
and
experience
sat
down
to
tell
the
story
of
their
life
in
it
there
are
no
puerile
whinings
no
querulous
curses
that
tropical
malays
do
not
order
their
lives
as
did
the
people
of
the
spanish
village
where
he
may
have
been
reared
no
selfish
laments
of
ingratitude
over
blessings
unasked
and
only
imperfectly
understood
by
the
natives
no
fatuous
as
to
the
real
conditions
but
a
patient
consideration
of
the
difficulties
encountered
the
good
accomplished
and
the
unavoidable
evils
incident
to
any
human
work
the
country
and
the
people
too
are
described
with
the
charming
simplicity
of
the
eyes
that
see
clearly
the
brain
that
ponders
deeply
and
the
heart
that
beats
sympathetically
through
all
the
pages
of
his
account
runs
the
quiet
strain
of
peace
and
contentment
of
satisfaction
with
the
existing
order
for
he
had
looked
upon
the
creation
and
saw
that
it
was
good
there
is
neither
haste
nor
hate
nor
anger
but
the
deliberate
recital
of
the
facts
warmed
and
illumined
by
the
geniality
of
a
soul
to
whom
age
and
experience
had
brought
not
a
sour
cynicism
but
the
mellowing
influence
of
a
ripened
philosophy
he
was
such
an
old
man
as
may
fondly
be
imagined
walking
through
the
streets
of
parañaque
in
stately
benignity
amid
the
fear
and
respect
of
the
brown
people
over
whom
he
watched
but
in
all
his
chronicle
there
is
no
suggestion
of
anything
more
to
hope
for
anything
beyond
beautiful
as
the
picture
is
it
is
that
of
a
system
which
had
reached
maturity
a
condition
of
stagnation
not
of
growth
in
less
than
a
decade
the
terrific
convulsions
in
european
politics
made
themselves
felt
even
in
the
remote
philippines
and
then
began
the
gradual
drawing
away
of
the
people
from
their
rulers
blind
gropings
and
erratic
wanderings
at
first
but
nevertheless
persistent
and
vigorous
tendencies
the
first
notable
influence
was
the
admission
of
representatives
for
the
philippines
into
the
spanish
cortes
under
the
revolutionary
governments
and
the
abolition
of
the
trade
monopoly
with
mexico
the
last
galleon
reached
manila
in
and
soon
foreign
commercial
interests
were
permitted
in
a
restricted
way
to
enter
the
country
then
with
the
separation
of
mexico
and
the
other
american
colonies
from
spain
a
more
marked
change
was
brought
about
in
that
direct
communication
was
established
with
the
mother
country
and
the
absolutism
of
the
hagiarchy
first
questioned
by
the
numbers
of
peninsular
spaniards
who
entered
the
islands
to
trade
some
even
to
settle
and
rear
families
there
these
also
affected
the
native
population
in
the
larger
centers
by
the
spread
of
their
ideas
which
were
not
always
in
conformity
with
those
that
for
several
centuries
the
friars
had
been
inculcating
into
their
wards
moreover
there
was
a
portion
of
the
population
sprung
from
the
friars
themselves
who
were
eager
to
adopt
the
customs
and
ideas
of
the
spanish
immigrants
the
suppression
of
many
of
the
monasteries
in
spain
in
caused
a
large
influx
of
the
disestablished
monks
into
the
philippines
in
search
for
a
haven
and
a
home
thus
bringing
about
a
conflict
with
the
native
clergy
who
were
displaced
from
their
best
holdings
to
provide
berths
for
the
newcomers
at
the
same
time
the
increase
of
education
among
the
native
priests
brought
the
natural
demand
for
more
equitable
treatment
by
the
spanish
friar
so
insistent
that
it
even
broke
out
into
open
rebellion
in
on
the
part
of
a
young
tagalog
who
thought
himself
aggrieved
in
this
respect
thus
the
struggle
went
on
with
stagnation
above
and
some
growth
below
so
that
the
governors
were
ever
getting
further
away
from
the
governed
and
for
such
a
movement
there
is
in
the
course
of
nature
but
one
inevitable
result
especially
when
outside
influences
are
actively
at
work
penetrating
the
social
system
and
making
for
better
things
among
these
influences
four
cumulative
ones
may
be
noted
the
spread
of
journalism
the
introduction
of
steamships
into
the
philippines
the
return
of
the
jesuits
and
the
opening
of
the
suez
canal
the
entered
the
islands
with
the
conquest
but
its
use
had
been
strictly
confined
to
religious
works
until
about
the
middle
of
the
past
century
when
there
was
a
sudden
awakening
and
within
a
few
years
five
journals
were
being
published
in
appeared
the
first
regular
newspaper
of
importance
diario
de
and
about
a
decade
later
the
principal
organ
of
the
population
which
with
varying
vicissitudes
has
continued
down
to
the
present
while
rigorously
censored
both
politically
and
religiously
and
accessible
to
only
an
infinitesimal
portion
of
the
people
they
still
performed
the
service
of
letting
a
few
rays
of
light
into
the
cimmerian
intellectual
gloom
of
the
time
and
place
with
the
coming
of
steam
navigation
communication
between
the
different
parts
of
the
islands
was
facilitated
and
trade
encouraged
with
all
that
such
a
change
meant
in
the
way
of
breaking
up
the
old
isolation
and
tending
to
a
common
understanding
spanish
power
too
was
for
the
moment
more
firmly
established
and
moro
piracy
in
luzon
and
the
bisayan
islands
which
had
been
so
great
a
drawback
to
the
development
of
the
country
was
forever
ended
the
return
of
the
jesuits
produced
two
general
results
tending
to
dissatisfaction
with
the
existing
order
to
them
was
assigned
the
missionary
field
of
mindanao
which
meant
the
displacement
of
the
recollect
fathers
in
the
missions
there
and
for
these
other
berths
had
to
be
found
again
the
native
clergy
were
the
losers
in
that
they
had
to
give
up
their
best
parishes
in
luzon
especially
around
manila
and
cavite
so
the
breach
was
further
widened
and
the
soil
sown
with
discontent
but
more
than
this
immediate
result
was
the
educational
movement
inaugurated
by
the
jesuits
the
native
already
feeling
the
vague
impulses
from
without
and
stirred
by
the
growing
restlessness
of
the
times
here
saw
a
new
world
open
before
him
a
considerable
portion
of
the
native
population
in
the
larger
centers
who
had
shared
in
the
economic
progress
of
the
colony
were
enabled
to
look
beyond
their
daily
needs
and
to
afford
their
children
an
opportunity
for
study
and
advancement
a
condition
and
a
need
met
by
the
jesuits
for
a
time
with
the
opening
of
the
suez
canal
in
communication
with
the
mother
country
became
cheaper
quicker
surer
so
that
large
numbers
of
spaniards
many
of
them
in
sympathy
with
the
republican
movements
at
home
came
to
the
philippines
in
search
of
fortunes
and
generally
left
families
who
had
imbibed
their
ideas
native
boys
who
had
already
felt
the
intoxication
of
such
learning
as
the
schools
of
manila
afforded
them
began
to
dream
of
greater
wonders
in
spain
now
that
the
journey
was
possible
for
them
so
began
the
definite
movements
that
led
directly
to
the
disintegration
of
the
friar
régime
in
the
same
year
occurred
the
revolution
in
the
mother
country
which
had
tired
of
the
old
corrupt
despotism
isabella
ii
was
driven
into
exile
and
the
country
left
to
waver
about
uncertainly
for
several
years
passing
through
all
the
stages
of
government
from
red
radicalism
to
absolute
conservatism
finally
adjusting
itself
to
the
middle
course
of
constitutional
monarchism
during
the
effervescent
and
ephemeral
republic
there
was
sent
to
the
philippines
a
governor
who
set
to
work
to
modify
the
old
system
and
establish
a
government
more
in
harmony
with
modern
ideas
and
more
democratic
in
form
his
changes
were
hailed
with
delight
by
the
growing
class
of
filipinos
who
were
striving
for
more
consideration
in
their
own
country
and
who
in
their
enthusiasm
and
the
intoxication
of
the
moment
perhaps
became
more
radical
than
was
safe
under
the
conditions
surely
too
radical
for
their
religious
guides
watching
and
waiting
behind
the
veil
of
the
temple
in
january
an
uprising
occurred
in
the
naval
arsenal
at
cavite
with
a
spanish
officer
as
one
of
the
leaders
from
the
meager
evidence
now
obtainable
this
would
seem
to
have
been
purely
a
local
mutiny
over
the
service
questions
of
pay
and
treatment
but
in
it
the
friars
saw
their
opportunity
it
was
blazoned
forth
with
all
the
wild
panic
that
was
to
characterize
the
actions
of
the
governing
powers
from
that
time
on
as
the
premature
outbreak
of
a
general
insurrection
under
the
leadership
of
the
native
clergy
and
rigorous
repressive
measures
were
demanded
three
native
priests
notable
for
their
popularity
among
their
own
people
one
an
octogenarian
and
the
other
two
young
canons
of
the
manila
cathedral
were
summarily
garroted
along
with
the
renegade
spanish
officer
who
had
participated
in
the
mutiny
no
record
of
any
trial
of
these
priests
has
ever
been
brought
to
light
the
archbishop
himself
a
secular
clergyman
stoutly
refused
to
degrade
them
from
their
holy
office
and
they
wore
their
sacerdotal
robes
at
the
execution
which
was
conducted
in
a
hurried
fearful
manner
at
the
same
time
a
number
of
young
manilans
who
had
taken
conspicuous
part
in
the
liberal
demonstrations
were
deported
to
the
ladrone
islands
or
to
remote
islands
of
the
philippine
group
itself
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
yet
there
immediately
followed
the
delusive
calm
which
ever
precedes
the
fatal
outburst
lulling
those
marked
for
destruction
to
a
delusive
security
the
two
decades
following
were
years
of
quiet
unobtrusive
growth
during
which
the
philippine
islands
made
the
greatest
economic
progress
in
their
history
but
this
in
itself
was
preparing
the
final
catastrophe
for
if
there
be
any
fact
well
established
in
human
experience
it
is
that
with
economic
development
the
power
of
organized
religion
begins
to
wane
the
rise
of
the
merchant
spells
the
decline
of
the
priest
a
sordid
change
from
masses
and
mysteries
to
sugar
and
shoes
this
is
often
said
to
be
but
it
should
be
noted
that
the
epochs
of
greatest
economic
activity
have
been
those
during
which
the
generality
of
mankind
have
lived
fuller
and
freer
lives
and
above
all
that
in
such
eras
the
finest
intellects
and
the
grandest
souls
have
been
developed
nor
does
an
institution
that
has
been
slowly
growing
for
three
centuries
molding
the
very
life
and
fiber
of
the
people
disintegrate
without
a
violent
struggle
either
in
its
own
constitution
or
in
the
life
of
the
people
trained
under
it
not
only
the
ecclesiastical
but
also
the
social
and
political
system
of
the
country
was
controlled
by
the
religious
orders
often
silently
and
secretly
but
none
the
less
effectively
this
is
evident
from
the
ceaseless
conflict
that
went
on
between
the
religious
orders
and
the
spanish
political
administrators
who
were
at
every
turn
thwarted
in
their
efforts
to
keep
the
government
abreast
of
the
times
the
shock
of
the
affair
of
had
apparently
stunned
the
filipinos
but
it
had
at
the
same
time
brought
them
to
the
parting
of
the
ways
and
induced
a
vague
feeling
that
there
was
something
radically
wrong
which
could
only
be
righted
by
a
closer
union
among
themselves
they
began
to
consider
that
their
interests
and
those
of
the
governing
powers
were
not
the
same
in
these
feelings
of
distrust
toward
the
friars
they
were
stimulated
by
the
great
numbers
of
immigrant
spaniards
who
were
then
entering
the
country
many
of
whom
had
taken
part
in
the
republican
movements
at
home
and
who
upon
the
restoration
of
the
monarchy
no
doubt
thought
it
safer
for
them
to
be
at
as
great
a
distance
as
possible
from
the
throne
the
young
filipinos
studying
in
spain
came
from
different
parts
of
the
islands
and
by
their
association
there
in
a
foreign
land
were
learning
to
forget
their
narrow
sectionalism
hence
the
way
was
being
prepared
for
some
concerted
action
thus
aided
and
encouraged
by
the
spaniards
in
the
mother
country
there
was
growing
up
a
new
generation
of
native
leaders
who
looked
toward
something
better
than
the
old
system
it
is
with
this
period
in
the
history
of
the
country
the
boyhood
that
the
story
of
me
deals
typical
scenes
and
characters
are
sketched
from
life
with
wonderful
accuracy
and
the
picture
presented
is
that
of
a
who
knew
and
loved
his
subject
terror
and
repression
were
the
order
of
the
day
with
ever
a
growing
unrest
in
the
higher
circles
while
the
native
population
at
large
seemed
to
be
completely
brutalized
is
the
term
repeatedly
used
by
rizal
in
his
political
essays
spanish
writers
of
the
period
observing
only
the
superficial
movements
some
of
which
were
indeed
fantastical
enough
for
they
who
in
oppression
darkness
caved
have
dwelt
they
are
not
eagles
nourished
with
the
day
what
marvel
then
at
times
if
they
mistake
their
way
and
not
heeding
the
currents
at
work
below
take
great
delight
in
ridiculing
the
pretensions
of
the
young
men
seeking
advancement
while
they
indulge
in
coarse
ribaldry
over
the
wretched
condition
of
the
great
mass
of
the
indians
the
author
however
himself
a
miserable
indian
vividly
depicts
the
unnatural
conditions
and
dominant
characters
produced
under
the
outworn
system
of
fraud
and
force
at
the
same
time
presenting
his
people
as
living
feeling
struggling
individuals
with
all
the
frailties
of
human
nature
and
all
the
possibilities
of
mankind
either
for
good
or
evil
incidentally
he
throws
into
marked
contrast
the
despicable
depreciation
used
by
the
spanish
writers
in
referring
to
the
filipinos
making
clear
the
application
of
the
proposition
that
no
ordinary
human
being
in
the
presence
of
superior
force
can
very
well
conduct
himself
as
a
man
unless
he
be
treated
as
such
the
friar
orders
deluded
by
their
transient
triumph
and
secure
in
their
pride
of
place
became
more
arrogant
more
domineering
than
ever
in
the
general
administration
the
political
rulers
were
at
every
turn
thwarted
their
best
efforts
frustrated
and
if
they
ventured
too
far
their
own
security
threatened
for
in
the
wrangle
which
lasted
throughout
the
whole
of
the
spanish
domination
the
friar
orders
had
in
addition
to
the
strength
derived
from
their
organization
and
their
wealth
the
damoclean
weapon
of
control
over
the
natives
to
hang
above
the
heads
of
both
governor
and
archbishop
the
curates
in
the
towns
always
the
real
rulers
became
veritable
despots
so
that
no
voice
dared
to
raise
itself
against
them
even
in
the
midst
of
conditions
which
the
humblest
was
beginning
to
feel
dumbly
to
be
perverted
and
unnatural
and
that
too
after
three
centuries
of
training
under
the
system
that
he
had
ever
been
taught
to
accept
as
the
will
of
god
the
friars
seemed
long
since
to
have
forgotten
those
noble
aims
that
had
meant
so
much
to
the
founders
and
early
workers
of
their
orders
if
indeed
the
great
majority
of
those
of
the
later
day
had
ever
realized
the
meaning
of
their
office
for
the
spanish
writers
of
the
time
delight
in
characterizing
them
as
the
meanest
of
the
spanish
peasantry
when
not
something
worse
who
had
been
lassoed
taught
a
few
ritualistic
prayers
and
shipped
to
the
philippines
to
be
placed
in
isolated
towns
as
lords
and
masters
of
the
native
population
with
all
the
power
and
prestige
over
a
docile
people
that
the
sacredness
of
their
holy
office
gave
them
these
writers
treat
the
matter
lightly
seeing
in
it
rather
a
huge
joke
on
the
miserable
indians
and
give
the
friars
great
credit
for
patriotism
a
term
which
in
this
connection
they
dragged
from
depth
to
depth
until
it
quite
aptly
fitted
johnson
famous
definition
the
last
refuge
of
a
scoundrel
in
their
conduct
the
religious
corporations
both
as
societies
and
as
individuals
must
be
estimated
according
to
their
own
standards
the
application
of
any
other
criterion
would
be
palpably
unfair
they
undertook
to
hold
the
native
in
subjection
to
regulate
the
essential
activities
of
his
life
according
to
their
ideas
so
upon
them
must
fall
the
responsibility
for
the
conditions
finally
attained
to
destroy
the
freedom
of
the
subject
and
then
attempt
to
blame
him
for
his
conduct
is
a
paradox
into
which
the
learned
men
often
fell
perhaps
inadvertently
through
their
deductive
logic
they
endeavored
to
shape
the
lives
of
their
malay
wards
not
only
in
this
existence
but
also
in
the
next
their
vows
were
poverty
chastity
and
obedience
the
vow
of
poverty
was
early
relegated
to
the
limbo
of
neglect
only
a
few
years
after
the
founding
of
manila
royal
decrees
began
to
issue
on
the
subject
of
complaints
received
by
the
king
over
the
usurpation
of
lands
on
the
part
of
the
priests
using
the
same
methods
so
familiar
in
the
heyday
of
the
institution
of
monasticism
in
europe
pious
gifts
deathbed
bequests
pilgrims
offerings
the
friar
orders
gradually
secured
the
richest
of
the
arable
lands
in
the
more
thickly
settled
portions
of
the
philippines
notably
the
part
of
luzon
occupied
by
the
tagalogs
not
always
however
it
must
in
justice
be
recorded
were
such
doubtful
means
resorted
to
for
there
were
instances
where
the
missionary
was
the
pioneer
gathering
about
himself
a
band
of
devoted
natives
and
plunging
into
the
unsettled
parts
to
build
up
a
town
with
its
fields
around
it
which
would
later
become
a
friar
estate
with
the
accumulated
incomes
from
these
estates
and
the
fees
for
religious
observances
that
poured
into
their
treasuries
the
orders
in
their
nature
of
perpetual
corporations
became
the
masters
of
the
situation
the
lords
of
the
country
but
this
condition
was
not
altogether
objectionable
it
was
in
the
excess
of
their
greed
that
they
went
astray
for
the
native
peoples
had
been
living
under
this
system
through
generations
and
not
until
they
began
to
feel
that
they
were
not
receiving
fair
treatment
did
they
question
the
authority
of
a
power
which
not
only
secured
them
a
peaceful
existence
in
this
life
but
also
assured
them
eternal
felicity
in
the
next
with
only
the
shining
exceptions
that
are
produced
in
any
system
no
matter
how
false
its
premises
or
how
decadent
it
may
become
to
uphold
faith
in
the
intrinsic
soundness
of
human
nature
the
vow
of
chastity
was
never
much
more
than
a
myth
through
the
tremendous
influence
exerted
over
a
fanatically
religious
people
who
implicitly
followed
the
teachings
of
the
reverend
fathers
once
their
confidence
had
been
secured
the
curate
was
seldom
to
be
gainsaid
in
his
desires
by
means
of
the
secret
influence
in
the
confessional
and
the
more
open
political
power
wielded
by
him
the
fairest
was
his
to
command
and
the
favored
one
and
her
people
looked
upon
the
choice
more
as
an
honor
than
otherwise
for
besides
the
social
standing
that
it
gave
her
there
was
the
proud
prospect
of
becoming
the
mother
of
children
who
could
claim
kinship
with
the
dominant
race
the
curate
companion
or
the
sacristan
wife
was
a
power
in
the
community
her
family
was
raised
to
a
place
of
importance
and
influence
among
their
own
people
while
she
and
her
ecclesiastical
offspring
were
well
cared
for
on
the
death
or
removal
of
the
curate
it
was
almost
invariably
found
that
she
had
been
provided
with
a
husband
or
protector
and
a
not
inconsiderable
amount
of
property
an
arrangement
rather
appealing
to
a
people
among
whom
the
means
of
living
have
ever
been
so
insecure
that
this
practise
was
not
particularly
offensive
to
the
people
among
whom
they
dwelt
may
explain
the
situation
but
to
claim
that
it
excuses
the
friars
approaches
dangerously
close
to
casuistry
still
as
long
as
this
arrangement
was
decently
and
moderately
carried
out
there
seems
to
have
been
no
great
objection
nor
from
a
worldly
point
of
view
with
all
the
conditions
considered
could
there
be
much
but
the
old
story
of
excess
of
unbridled
power
turned
toward
bad
ends
again
recurs
at
the
same
time
that
the
ideas
brought
in
by
the
spaniards
who
came
each
year
in
increasing
numbers
and
the
principles
observed
by
the
young
men
studying
in
europe
cast
doubt
upon
the
fitness
of
such
a
state
of
affairs
as
they
approached
their
downfall
like
all
mankind
the
friars
became
more
open
more
insolent
more
shameless
in
their
conduct
the
story
of
maria
clara
as
told
in
me
is
by
no
means
an
exaggerated
instance
but
rather
one
of
the
few
clean
enough
to
bear
the
light
and
her
fate
as
depicted
in
the
epilogue
is
said
to
be
based
upon
an
actual
occurrence
with
which
the
author
must
have
been
familiar
the
vow
of
obedience
whether
considered
as
to
the
pope
their
highest
religious
authority
or
to
the
king
of
spain
their
political
liege
might
not
always
be
so
callously
disregarded
but
it
could
be
evaded
and
defied
from
the
vatican
came
bull
after
bull
from
the
escorial
decree
after
decree
only
to
be
archived
in
manila
sometimes
after
a
hollow
pretense
of
compliance
a
large
part
of
the
records
of
spanish
domination
is
taken
up
with
the
wearisome
quarrels
that
went
on
between
the
archbishop
representing
the
head
of
the
church
and
the
friar
orders
over
the
questions
of
the
episcopal
visitation
and
the
enforcement
of
the
provisions
of
the
council
of
trent
relegating
the
monks
to
their
original
status
of
missionaries
with
the
friars
invariably
victorious
in
their
contentions
royal
decrees
ordering
inquiries
into
the
titles
to
the
estates
of
the
men
of
poverty
and
those
providing
for
the
education
of
the
natives
in
spanish
were
merely
sneered
at
and
left
to
molder
in
harmless
quiet
not
without
good
grounds
for
his
contention
the
friar
claimed
that
the
spanish
dominion
over
the
philippines
depended
upon
him
and
he
therefore
confidently
set
himself
up
as
the
best
judge
of
how
that
dominion
should
be
maintained
thus
there
are
presented
in
the
philippines
of
the
closing
quarter
of
the
century
just
past
the
phenomena
so
frequently
met
with
in
modern
societies
so
disheartening
to
the
people
who
must
drag
out
their
lives
under
them
of
an
old
system
which
has
outworn
its
usefulness
and
is
being
called
into
question
with
forces
actively
at
work
disintegrating
it
yet
with
the
unhappy
folk
bred
and
reared
under
it
unprepared
for
a
new
order
of
things
the
old
faith
was
breaking
down
its
forms
and
beliefs
once
so
full
of
life
and
meaning
were
being
sharply
examined
doubt
and
suspicion
were
the
order
of
the
day
moreover
it
must
ever
be
borne
in
mind
that
in
the
philippines
this
unrest
except
in
the
parts
where
the
friars
were
the
landlords
was
not
general
among
the
people
the
masses
of
whom
were
still
sunk
in
their
loved
egyptian
night
but
affected
only
a
very
small
proportion
of
the
population
for
the
most
part
young
men
who
were
groping
their
way
toward
something
better
yet
without
any
very
clearly
conceived
idea
of
what
that
better
might
be
and
among
whom
was
to
be
found
the
usual
sprinkling
of
sunshine
patriots
and
omnipresent
opportunists
ready
for
any
kind
of
trouble
that
will
afford
them
a
chance
to
rise
add
to
the
apathy
of
the
masses
dragging
out
their
vacant
lives
amid
the
shadows
of
religious
superstition
and
to
the
unrest
of
the
few
the
fact
that
the
orders
were
in
absolute
control
of
the
political
machinery
of
the
country
with
the
best
part
of
the
agrarian
wealth
amortized
in
their
hands
add
also
the
jealousies
petty
feuds
and
racial
hatreds
for
which
manila
and
the
philippines
with
their
medley
of
creeds
and
races
offer
such
a
fertile
field
all
fostered
by
the
governing
class
for
the
maintenance
of
the
old
machiavelian
principle
of
divide
and
rule
and
the
sum
is
about
the
most
miserable
condition
under
which
any
portion
of
mankind
ever
tried
to
fulfill
nature
inexorable
laws
of
growth
ii
and
third
came
she
who
gives
dark
creeds
their
power
sorceress
draped
fair
in
many
lands
as
lowly
faith
but
ever
juggling
souls
with
rites
and
prayers
the
keeper
of
those
keys
which
lock
up
hells
and
open
heavens
wilt
thou
dare
she
said
put
by
our
sacred
books
dethrone
our
gods
unpeople
all
the

shaking
down
that

which
feeds
the

the

thee
unto
thy

sir

arnold
light
of
ah
simple
people
how
little
do
you
know
the
blessing
that
you
enjoy
neither
hunger
nor
nakedness
nor
inclemency
of
the
weather
troubles
you
with
the
payment
of
seven
reals
per
year
you
remain
free
of

you
do
not
have
to
close
your

with

you
do
not
fear
that
the
district

will
come
in
to

and
trample
you
under

at
your

you

the
one
who
is
in

over
you
perhaps
there
will
come
a
time
when
you
will
be
more
civilized
and
you
will
break
out
in
revolution
and
you
will
wake
terrified
at
the
tumult
of
the
riots
and
will
see
blood
flowing
through
these
quiet
fields
and
gallows
and
guillotines
erected
in
these
squares
which
never
yet
have
seen
an
execution
thus
moralized
a
spanish
traveler
in
just
as
that
far
was
drawing
to
its
close
already
men
had
begun
to
raise
in
the
spanish
parliament
the
question
of
the
future
of
the
philippines
looking
toward
some
definite
program
for
their
care
under
modern
conditions
and
for
the
adjustment
of
their
relations
with
the
mother
country
but
these
were
mere
the
horologe
of
time
was
striking
for
rome
successor
as
it
did
for
rome
herself
just
where
will
come
the
outbreak
after
three
centuries
of
and
of
forcing
a
growing
subject
into
the
of
medieval
thought
and
action
of
natural
selection
reversed
by
the
constant
elimination
of
native
initiative
and
leadership
is
indeed
a
curious
study
that
there
will
be
an
outbreak
somewhere
is
as
certain
as
that
the
plant
will
grow
toward
the
light
even
under
the
most
unfavorable
conditions
for
man
nature
is
but
the
resultant
of
eternal
forces
that
ceaselessly
and
irresistibly
interplay
about
and
upon
him
and
somewhere
this
resultant
will
express
itself
in
thought
or
deed
after
three
centuries
of
spanish
ecclesiastical
domination
in
the
philippines
it
was
to
be
expected
that
the
wards
would
turn
against
their
mentors
the
methods
that
had
been
used
upon
them
nor
is
it
especially
remarkable
that
there
was
a
decided
tendency
in
some
parts
to
revert
to
primitive
barbarism
but
that
concurrently
a
creative
genius
a
bard
or
seer
should
have
been
developed
among
a
people
who
as
a
whole
have
hardly
passed
through
the
clan
or
village
stage
of
society
can
be
regarded
as
little
less
than
a
psychological
phenomenon
and
provokes
the
perhaps
presumptuous
inquiry
as
to
whether
there
may
not
be
some
things
about
our
common
human
nature
that
the
learned
doctors
have
not
yet
included
in
their
anthropometric
diagrams
on
the
western
shore
of
the
lake
of
bay
in
the
heart
of
the
philippines
clusters
the
village
of
kalamba
first
established
by
the
jesuit
fathers
in
the
early
days
of
the
conquest
and
upon
their
expulsion
in
taken
over
by
the
crown
which
later
transferred
it
to
the
dominicans
under
whose
care
the
fertile
fields
about
it
became
one
of
the
richest
of
the
friar
estates
it
can
hardly
be
called
a
town
even
for
the
philippines
but
is
rather
a
set
as
it
is
at
the
outlet
of
the
rich
country
of
northern
batangas
on
the
open
waterway
to
manila
and
the
outside

of

and
but
a
few
miles
to
the
southwestward
seething
taal
mutters
and
moans
of
the
world
it
is
the
center
of
a
region
rich
in
native
lore
and
legend
as
it
sleeps
through
the
dusty
noons
when
the
cacao
leaves
droop
with
the
heat
and
dreams
through
the
silvery
nights
waking
twice
or
thrice
a
week
to
the
endless
babble
and
ceaseless
chatter
of
an
oriental
market
where
the
noisy
throngs
make
of
their
trading
as
much
a
matter
of
pleasure
and
recreation
as
of
business
directly
opposite
this
in
a
house
facing
the
village
church
there
was
born
in
into
the
already
large
family
of
one
of
the
more
prosperous
tenants
on
the
dominican
estate
a
boy
who
was
to
combine
in
his
person
the
finest
traits
of
the
oriental
character
with
the
best
that
spanish
and
european
culture
could
add
on
whom
would
fall
the
burden
of
his
people
woes
to
lead
him
over
the
of
struggle
and
sacrifice
ending
in
his
own
destruction
amid
the
crumbling
ruins
of
the
system
whose
disintegration
he
himself
had
done
so
much
to
compass
josé
y
alonso
as
his
name
emerges
from
the
confusion
of
filipino
nomenclature
was
of
malay
extraction
with
some
distant
strains
of
spanish
and
chinese
blood
his
genealogy
reveals
several
persons
remarkable
for
intellect
and
independence
of
character
notably
a
philippine
eloise
and
abelard
who
drawn
together
by
their
common
enthusiasm
for
study
and
learning
became
his
maternal
grandparents
as
well
as
a
who
was
a
traveler
and
student
and
who
directed
the
boy
early
studies
thus
from
the
beginning
his
training
was
exceptional
while
his
mind
was
stirred
by
the
trouble
already
brewing
in
his
community
and
from
the
earliest
hours
of
consciousness
he
saw
about
him
the
wrongs
and
injustices
which
overgrown
power
will
ever
develop
in
dealing
with
a
weaker
subject
one
fact
of
his
childhood
too
stands
out
clearly
well
worthy
of
record
his
mother
seems
to
have
been
a
woman
of
more
than
ordinary
education
for
the
time
and
place
and
pleased
with
the
boy
quick
intelligence
she
taught
him
to
read
spanish
from
a
copy
of
the
vulgate
in
that
language
which
she
had
somehow
managed
to
secure
and
keep
in
her
possession
the
old
old
story
of
the
woman
and
the
book
repeated
often
enough
under
strange
circumstances
but
under
none
stranger
than
these
the
father
was
so
he
was
sent
at
the
age
of
eight
to
study
in
the
new
jesuit
school
in
manila
not
however
before
he
had
already
inspired
some
awe
in
his
simple
neighbors
by
the
facility
with
which
he
composed
verses
in
his
native
tongue
he
began
his
studies
in
a
private
house
while
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
enter
the
ateneo
as
the
jesuit
school
is
called
and
while
there
he
saw
one
of
his
tutors
padre
burgos
haled
to
an
ignominious
death
on
the
garrote
as
a
result
of
the
affair
of
this
made
a
deep
impression
on
his
childish
mind
and
in
fact
seems
to
have
been
one
of
the
principal
factors
in
molding
his
ideas
and
shaping
his
career
that
the
effect
upon
him
was
lasting
and
that
his
later
judgment
confirmed
him
in
the
belief
that
a
great
injustice
had
been
done
are
shown
by
the
fact
that
his
second
important
work
written
about
and
miscalled
by
himself
a
novel
for
it
is
really
a
series
of
constituting
a
terrific
arraignment
of
the
whole

degrade
you
has
placed
in
doubt
the
crime
imputed
to
you
the
government
in
surrounding
your
case
with
mystery
and
shadow
gives
reason
for

all
the

in
venerating
your
memory
and
calling

in

your
guilt
the
only
answer
he
ever
received
to
this
was
eight
remington
bullets
fired
into
his
back
in
the
ateneo
he
quickly
attracted
attention
and
became
a
general
favorite
by
his
application
to
his
studies
the
poetic
fervor
with
which
he
entered
into
all
the
exercises
of
religious
devotion
and
the
gentleness
of
his
character
he
was
from
the
first
considered
peculiar
for
so
the
common
mind
regards
everything
that
fails
to
fit
the
old
formulas
being
of
a
rather
dreamy
and
reticent
disposition
more
inclined
to
reading
spanish
romances
than
joining
in
the
games
of
his
schoolmates
and
of
all
the
literatures
that
could
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
an
imaginative
child
what
one
would
be
more
productive
in
a
receptive
mind
of
a
fervid
love
of
life
and
home
and
country
and
all
that
men
hold
dear
than
that
of
the
musical
language
of
castile
with
its
high
coloring
and
passionate
character
his
activities
were
varied
for
in
addition
to
his
regular
studies
he
demonstrated
considerable
skill
in
and
and
during
this
period
won
several
prizes
for
poetical
compositions
in
spanish
which
while
sometimes
juvenile
in
form
and
following
closely
after
spanish
models
reveal
at
times
flashes
of
thought
and
turns
of
expression
that
show
distinct
originality
even
in
these
early
compositions
there
is
that
plaintive
undertone
that
minor
chord
of
sadness
which
pervades
all
his
poems
reaching
its
fullest
measure
of
pathos
in
the
verses
written
in
his
he
received
a
bachelor
degree
according
to
the
spanish
system
in
but
continued
advanced
studies
in
agriculture
at
the
ateneo
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
pursuing
the
course
in
philosophy
in
the
dominican
university
of
santo
tomas
where
in
he
startled
the
learned
doctors
by
a
reference
in
a
prize
poem
to
the
philippines
as
his
patria
fatherland
this
political
heresy
on
the
part
of
a
native
of
the
islands
was
given
no
very
serious
attention
at
the
time
being
looked
upon
as
the
vagary
of
a
schoolboy
but
again
in
the
following
year
by
what
seems
a
strange
fatality
he
stirred
the
resentment
of
the
friars
especially
the
dominicans
by
winning
over
some
of
their
number
the
first
prize
in
a
literary
contest
celebrated
in
honor
of
the
author
of
the
archaic
instruction
in
santo
tomas
soon
disgusted
him
and
led
to
disagreements
with
the
instructors
and
he
turned
to
spain
plans
for
his
journey
and
his
stay
there
had
to
be
made
with
the
utmost
caution
for
it
would
hardly
have
fared
well
with
his
family
had
it
become
known
that
the
son
of
a
tenant
on
an
estate
which
was
a
part
of
the
university
endowment
was
studying
in
europe
he
reached
spanish
territory
first
in
barcelona
the
hotbed
of
radicalism
where
he
heard
a
good
deal
of
revolutionary
talk
which
however
seems
to
have
made
but
little
impression
upon
him
for
throughout
his
entire
career
breadth
of
thought
and
strength
of
character
are
revealed
in
his
consistent
opposition
to
all
forms
of
violence
in
madrid
he
pursued
the
courses
in
medicine
and
philosophy
but
a
fact
of
even
more
consequence
than
his
proficiency
in
his
regular
work
was
his
persistent
study
of
languages
and
his
omnivorous
reading
he
was
associated
with
the
other
filipinos
who
were
working
in
a
somewhat
spectacular
way
misdirected
rather
than
led
by
what
may
be
styled
the
spanish
liberals
for
more
considerate
treatment
of
the
philippines
but
while
he
was
among
them
he
was
not
of
them
as
his
studious
habits
and
reticent
disposition
would
hardly
have
made
him
a
favorite
among
those
who
were
enjoying
the
broader
and
gayer
life
there
moreover
he
soon
advanced
far
beyond
them
in
thought
by
realizing
that
they
were
beginning
at
the
wrong
end
of
the
labor
for
even
at
that
time
he
seems
to
have
caught
by
what
must
almost
be
looked
upon
as
an
inspiration
of
genius
since
there
was
nothing
apparent
in
his
training
that
would
have
suggested
it
the
realization
of
the
fact
that
hope
for
his
people
lay
in
bettering
their
condition
that
any
real
benefit
must
begin
with
the
benighted
folk
at
home
that
the
introduction
of
reforms
for
which
they
were
unprepared
would
be
useless
even
dangerous
to
them
this
was
not
at
all
the
popular
idea
among
his
associates
and
led
to
serious
disagreements
with
their
leaders
for
it
was
the
way
of
toil
and
sacrifice
without
any
of
the
excitement
and
glamour
that
came
from
drawing
up
magnificent
plans
and
sending
them
back
home
with
appeals
for
funds
to
carry
on
the
propaganda
for
the
most
part
banquets
and
entertainments
to
political
leaders
his
views
as
revealed
in
his
purely
political
writings
may
be
succinctly
stated
for
he
had
that
faculty
of
expression
which
never
leaves
any
room
for
doubt
as
to
the
meaning
his
people
had
a
natural
right
to
grow
and
to
develop
and
any
obstacles
to
such
growth
and
development
were
to
be
removed
he
realized
that
the
masses
of
his
countrymen
were
sunk
deep
in
poverty
and
ignorance
cringing
and
crouching
before
political
authority
crawling
and
groveling
before
religious
superstition
but
to
him
this
was
no
subject
for
jest
or
indifferent
neglect
it
was
a
serious
condition
which
should
be
ameliorated
and
hope
lay
in
working
into
the
inert
social
mass
the
leaven
of
conscious
individual
effort
toward
the
development
of
a
distinctive
responsible
personality
he
was
profoundly
appreciative
of
all
the
good
that
spain
had
done
but
saw
in
this
no
inconsistency
with
the
desire
that
this
gratitude
might
be
given
cause
to
be
ever
on
the
increase
thereby
uniting
the
philippines
with
the
mother
country
by
the
firm
bonds
of
common
ideas
and
interests
for
his
earlier
writings
breathe
nothing
but
admiration
respect
and
loyalty
for
spain
and
her
more
advanced
institutions
the
issue
was
clear
to
him
and
he
tried
to
keep
it
so
it
was
indeed
administrative
myopia
induced
largely
by
blind
greed
which
allowed
the
friar
orders
to
confuse
the
objections
to
their
repressive
system
with
an
attack
upon
spanish
sovereignty
thereby
dragging
matters
from
bad
to
worse
to
engender
ill
feeling
and
finally
desperation
this
narrow
selfish
policy
had
about
as
much
soundness
in
it
as
the
idea
upon
which
it
was
based
so
often
brought
forward
with
what
looks
very
suspiciously
like
a
specious
effort
to
cover
mental
indolence
with
a
glittering
generality
that
the
filipino
is
only
a
child
and
needs
a
strong
paternal
government
an
idea
which
entirely
overlooks
the
natural
fact
that
when
an
impressionable
subject
comes
within
the
influence
of
a
stronger
force
from
a
higher
civilization
he
is
very
likely
to
remain
a
child
perhaps
a
stunted
one
as
long
as
he
is
treated
as
such
there
is
about
as
much
sense
and
justice
in
such
logic
as
there
would
be
in
that
of
keeping
a
babe
confined
in
and
then
blaming
it
for
not
knowing
how
to
walk
no
creature
will
remain
a
healthy
child
forever
but
as
spain
learned
to
her
bitter
cost
will
be
very
prone
as
the
parent
grows
decrepit
and
it
begins
to
feel
its
strength
to
prove
a
troublesome
subject
to
handle
thereby
reversing
the
natural
law
suggested
by
the
comparison
and
bringing
such
statecraft
to
flounder
at
last
through
as
hopeless
confusion
to
as
absurd
a
conclusion
as
his
own
island
government
rizal
was
not
one
of
those
rabid
revolutionists
who
would
merely
overthrow
the
government
and
maintain
the
old
system
with
themselves
in
the
privileged
places
of
the
former
rulers
nor
is
he
to
be
classed
among
the
misguided
enthusiasts
who
by
their
intemperate
demands
and
immoderate
conduct
merely
strengthen
the
hands
of
those
in
power
he
realized
fully
that
the
restrictions
under
which
the
people
had
become
accustomed
to
order
their
lives
should
be
removed
gradually
as
they
advanced
under
suitable
guidance
and
became
capable
of
adjusting
themselves
to
the
new
and
better
conditions
they
should
take
all
the
good
offered
from
any
source
especially
that
suited
to
their
nature
which
they
could
properly
assimilate
no
great
patience
was
ever
exhibited
by
him
toward
those
of
his
countrymen
the
most
repulsive
characters
in
his
stories
are
such
who
would
make
of
themselves
mere
apes
and
mimes
decorating
themselves
with
a
veneer
of
questionable
alien
characteristics
but
with
no
personality
or
stability
of
their
own
presenting
at
best
a
spectacle
to
make
devils
laugh
and
angels
weep
lacking
even
the
hothouse
product
virtue
of
being
good
to
look
upon
reduced
to
a
definite
form
the
wish
of
the
more
thoughtful
in
the
new
generation
of
filipino
leaders
that
was
growing
up
was
that
the
philippine
islands
be
made
a
province
of
spain
with
representation
in
the
cortes
and
the
concomitant
freedom
of
expression
and
criticism
all
that
was
directly
asked
was
some
substantial
participation
in
the
management
of
local
affairs
and
the
curtailment
of
the
arbitrary
power
of
petty
officials
especially
of
the
friar
curates
who
constituted
the
chief
obstacle
to
the
education
and
development
of
the
people
the
friar
orders
were
however
not
only
in
the
philippines
but
also
in
madrid
where
they
were
not
chary
of
making
use
of
a
part
of
their
wealth
to
maintain
their
influence
the
efforts
of
the
filipinos
in
spain
while
closely
watched
do
not
seem
to
have
been
given
any
very
serious
attention
for
the
spanish
authorities
no
doubt
realized
that
as
long
as
the
young
men
stayed
in
madrid
writing
manifestoes
in
a
language
which
less
than
one
per
cent
of
their
countrymen
could
read
and
spending
their
money
on
members
of
the
cortes
there
could
be
little
danger
of
trouble
in
the
philippines
moreover
the
spanish
ministers
themselves
appear
to
have
been
in
sympathy
with
the
more
moderate
wishes
of
the
filipinos
a
fact
indicated
by
the
number
of
changes
ordered
from
time
to
time
in
the
philippine
administration
but
they
were
powerless
before
the
strength
and
local
influence
of
the
religious
orders
so
matters
dragged
their
weary
way
along
until
there
was
an
unexpected
and
startling
development
a
contest
and
certainly
no
one
but
a
genius
could
have
polished
the
smooth
stone
that
was
to
smite
the
giant
it
is
said
that
the
idea
of
writing
a
novel
depicting
conditions
in
his
native
land
first
came
to
rizal
from
a
perusal
of
eugene
wandering
while
he
was
a
student
in
madrid
although
the
model
for
the
greater
part
of
it
is
plainly
the
delectable
sketches
in
for
the
author
himself
possessed
in
a
remarkable
degree
that
cervantic
touch
which
raises
the
commonplace
even
the
mean
into
the
highest
regions
of
art
not
however
until
he
had
spent
some
time
in
paris
continuing
his
medical
studies
and
later
in
germany
did
anything
definite
result
but
in
me
was
printed
in
berlin
in
an
establishment
where
the
author
is
said
to
have
worked
part
of
his
time
as
a
compositor
in
order
to
defray
his
expenses
while
he
continued
his
studies
a
limited
edition
was
published
through
the
financial
aid
extended
by
a
filipino
associate
and
sent
to
hongkong
thence
to
be
surreptitiously
introduced
into
the
philippines
me
touch
me
not
at
the
time
the
work
was
written
had
a
peculiar
fitness
as
a
title
not
only
was
there
an
apt
suggestion
of
a
comparison
with
the
common
flower
of
that
name
but
the
term
is
also
applied
in
pathology
to
a
malignant
cancer
which
affects
every
bone
and
tissue
in
the
body
and
that
this
latter
was
in
the
author
mind
would
appear
from
the
dedication
and
from
the
of
the
philippine
situation
in
the
final
conversation
between
ibarra
and
elias
but
in
a
letter
written
to
a
friend
in
paris
at
the
time
the
author
himself
says
that
it
was
taken
from
the
gospel
scene
where
the
risen
savior
appears
to
the
magdalene
to
whom
he
addresses
these
words
a
scene
that
has
been
the
subject
of
several
notable
paintings
in
this
connection
it
is
interesting
to
note
what
he
himself
thought
of
the
work
and
his
frank
statement
of
what
he
had
tried
to
accomplish
made
just
as
he
was
publishing
it
me
an
expression
taken
from
the
gospel
of
luke
means
me
the
book
contains
things
of
which
no
one
up
to
the
present
time
has
spoken
for
they
are
so
sensitive
that
they
have
never
suffered
themselves
to
be
touched
by
any
one
whomsoever
for
my
own
part
i
have
attempted
to
do
what
no
one
else
has
been
willing
to
do
i
have
dared
to
answer
the
calumnies
that
have
for
centuries
been
heaped
upon
us
and
our
country
i
have
written
of
the
social
condition
and
the
life
of
our
beliefs
our
hopes
our
longings
our
complaints
and
our
sorrows
i
have
unmasked
the
hypocrisy
which
under
the
cloak
of
religion
has
come
among
us
to
impoverish
and
to
brutalize
us
i
have
distinguished
the
true
religion
from
the
false
from
the
superstition
that
traffics
with
the
holy
word
to
get
money
and
to
make
us
believe
in
absurdities
for
which
catholicism
would
blush
if
ever
it
knew
of
them
i
have
unveiled
that
which
has
been
hidden
behind
the
deceptive
and
dazzling
words
of
our
governments
i
have
told
our
countrymen
of
our
mistakes
our
vices
our
faults
and
our
weak
complaisance
with
our
miseries
there
where
i
have
found
virtue
i
have
spoken
of
it
highly
in
order
to
render
it
homage
and
if
i
have
not
wept
in
speaking
of
our
misfortunes
i
have
laughed
over
them
for
no
one
would
wish
to
weep
with
me
over
our
woes
and
laughter
is
ever
the
best
means
of
concealing
sorrow
the
deeds
that
i
have
related
are
true
and
have
actually
occurred
i
can
furnish
proof
of
this
my
book
may
have
and
it
does
have
defects
from
an
artistic
and
esthetic
point
of
view
this
i
do
not
deny
but
no
one
can
dispute
the
veracity
of
the
facts
presented
but
while
the
primary
purpose
and
first
effect
of
the
work
was
to
crystallize
sentiment
the
author
has
risen
above
a
mere
personal
attack
which
would
give
it
only
a
temporary
value
and
by
portraying
in
so
clear
and
sympathetic
a
way
the
life
of
his
people
has
produced
a
piece
of
real
literature
of
especial
interest
now
as
they
are
being
swept
into
the
newer
day
any
fool
can
point
out
errors
and
defects
if
they
are
at
all
apparent
and
the
persistent
searching
them
out
for
their
own
sake
is
the
surest
mark
of
the
vulpine
mind
but
the
author
has
east
aside
all
such
petty
considerations
and
whether
consciously
or
not
has
left
a
work
of
permanent
value
to
his
own
people
and
of
interest
to
all
friends
of
humanity
if
ever
a
fair
land
has
been
cursed
with
the
wearisome
breed
of
both
indigenous
and
exotic
that
land
is
the
philippines
so
it
is
indeed
refreshing
to
turn
from
the
dreary
waste
of
carping
criticisms
pragmatical
scientific
analyses
and
sneering
to
a
story
pulsating
with
life
presenting
the
filipino
as
a
human
being
with
his
virtues
and
his
vices
his
loves
and
hates
his
hopes
and
fears
the
publication
of
me
suggests
the
reflection
that
the
story
of
achilles
heel
is
a
myth
only
in
form
the
belief
that
any
institution
system
organization
or
arrangement
has
reached
an
absolute
form
is
about
as
far
as
human
folly
can
go
the
friar
orders
looked
upon
themselves
as
the
sum
of
human
achievement
in
and
divinely
appointed
to
rule
fixed
in
their
power
far
above
suspicion
yet
they
were
obsessed
by
the
sensitive
covert
dread
of
exposure
that
ever
lurks
spectrally
under
pharisaism
specious
robe
so
when
there
appeared
this
work
of
a
miserable
indian
who
dared
to
portray
them
and
the
conditions
that
their
control
produced
exactly
as
they
were
for
the
indefinable
touch
by
which
the
author
gives
an
air
of
unimpeachable
veracity
to
his
story
is
perhaps
its
greatest
artistic
merit
the
effect
upon
the
mercurial
spanish
temperament
was
to
say
the
least
electric
the
very
audacity
of
the
thing
left
the
friars
breathless
a
committee
of
learned
doctors
from
santo
tomas
who
were
appointed
to
examine
the
work
unmercifully
scored
it
as
attacking
everything
from
the
state
religion
to
the
integrity
of
the
spanish
dominions
so
the
circulation
of
it
in
the
philippines
was
of
course
strictly
prohibited
which
naturally
made
the
demand
for
it
greater
large
sums
were
paid
for
single
copies
of
which
it
might
be
remarked
in
passing
the
author
himself
received
scarcely
any
part
collections
have
ever
had
a
curious
habit
of
going
astray
in
the
philippines
although
the
possession
of
a
copy
by
a
filipino
usually
meant
summary
imprisonment
or
deportation
often
with
the
concomitant
confiscation
of
property
for
the
benefit
of
some
patriot
the
book
was
widely
read
among
the
leading
families
and
had
the
desired
effect
of
crystallizing
the
sentiment
against
the
friars
thus
to
pave
the
way
for
concerted
action
at
last
the
idol
had
been
flouted
so
all
could
attack
it
within
a
year
after
it
had
begun
to
circulate
in
the
philippines
a
memorial
was
presented
to
the
archbishop
by
quite
a
respectable
part
of
the
filipinos
in
manila
requesting
that
the
friar
orders
be
expelled
from
the
country
but
this
resulted
only
in
the
deportation
of
every
signer
of
the
petition
upon
whom
the
government
could
lay
hands
they
were
scattered
literally
to
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
some
to
the
ladrone
islands
some
to
fernando
po
off
the
west
coast
of
africa
some
to
spanish
prisons
others
to
remote
parts
of
the
philippines
meanwhile
the
author
had
returned
to
the
philippines
for
a
visit
to
his
family
during
which
time
he
was
constantly
attended
by
an
officer
of
the
civil
guard
detailed
ostensibly
as
a
all
his
movements
were
closely
watched
and
after
a
few
months
the
advised
him
to
leave
the
country
at
the
same
time
requesting
a
copy
of
me
saying
that
the
excerpts
submitted
to
him
by
the
censor
had
awakened
a
desire
to
read
the
entire
work
rizal
returned
to
europe
by
way
of
japan
and
the
united
states
which
did
not
seem
to
make
any
distinct
impression
upon
him
although
it
was
only
a
little
later
that
he
predicted
that
when
spain
lost
control
of
the
philippines
an
eventuality
he
seemed
to
consider
certain
not
far
in
the
future
the
united
states
would
be
a
probable
successor
returning
to
europe
he
spent
some
time
in
london
preparing
an
edition
of
morga
de
las
a
work
published
in
mexico
about
by
the
principal
actor
in
some
of
the
most
stirring
scenes
of
the
formative
period
of
the
philippine
government
it
is
a
record
of
prime
importance
in
philippine
history
and
the
resuscitation
of
it
was
no
small
service
to
the
country
rizal
added
notes
tending
to
show
that
the
filipinos
had
been
possessed
of
considerable
culture
and
civilization
before
the
spanish
conquest
and
he
even
intimated
that
they
had
retrograded
rather
than
advanced
under
spanish
tutelage
but
such
an
extreme
view
must
be
ascribed
to
patriotic
ardor
for
rizal
himself
though
possessed
of
that
intangible
quality
commonly
known
as
genius
and
partly
trained
in
northern
europe
is
still
in
his
own
personality
the
strongest
refutation
of
such
a
contention
later
in
ghent
he
published
called
by
him
a
continuation
of
me
but
with
which
it
really
has
no
more
connection
than
that
some
of
the
characters
reappear
and
are
disposed
of
there
is
almost
no
connected
plot
in
it
and
hardly
any
action
but
there
is
the
same
incisive
and
clear
etching
of
conditions
that
characterize
the
earlier
work
it
is
a
maturer
effort
and
a
more
forceful
political
argument
hence
it
lacks
the
charm
and
simplicity
which
assign
me
to
a
preeminent
place
in
philippine
literature
the
light
satire
of
the
earlier
work
is
replaced
by
bitter
sarcasm
delivered
with
deliberate
intent
for
the
iron
had
evidently
entered
his
soul
with
broadening
experience
and
the
realization
that
justice
at
the
hands
of
decadent
spain
had
been
an
iridescent
dream
of
his
youth
nor
had
the
spanish
authorities
in
the
philippines
been
idle
his
relatives
had
been
subjected
to
all
the
annoyances
and
irritations
of
petty
persecution
eventually
losing
the
greater
part
of
their
property
while
some
of
them
suffered
deportation
in
he
returned
to
hongkong
to
practise
medicine
in
which
profession
he
had
remarkable
success
even
coming
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
wizard
by
his
simple
countrymen
among
whom
circulated
wonderful
accounts
of
his
magical
powers
he
was
especially
skilled
in
ophthalmology
and
his
first
operation
after
returning
from
his
studies
in
europe
was
to
restore
his
mother
sight
by
removing
a
cataract
from
one
of
her
eyes
an
achievement
which
no
doubt
formed
the
basis
of
marvelous
tales
but
the
misfortunes
of
his
people
were
ever
the
paramount
consideration
so
he
wrote
to
the
requesting
permission
to
remove
his
numerous
relatives
to
borneo
to
establish
a
colony
there
for
which
purpose
liberal
concessions
had
been
offered
him
by
the
british
government
the
request
was
denied
and
further
stigmatized
as
an
unpatriotic
attempt
to
lessen
the
population
of
the
philippines
when
labor
was
already
scarce
this
was
the
answer
he
received
to
a
reasonable
petition
after
the
homes
of
his
family
including
his
own
birthplace
had
been
ruthlessly
destroyed
by
military
force
while
a
quarrel
over
ownership
and
rents
was
still
pending
in
the
courts
the
at
the
time
was
valeriano
weyler
the
pitiless
instrument
of
the
reactionary
forces
manipulated
by
the
monastic
orders
he
who
was
later
sent
to
cuba
to
introduce
there
the
repressive
measures
which
had
apparently
been
so
efficacious
in
the
philippines
thus
to
bring
on
the
interference
of
the
united
states
to
end
spain
colonial
power
all
of
which
induces
the
reflection
that
there
may
still
be
deluded
casuists
who
doubt
the
reality
of
nemesis
weyler
was
succeeded
by
eulogio
despujols
who
made
sincere
attempts
to
reform
the
administration
and
was
quite
popular
with
the
filipinos
in
reply
to
repeated
requests
from
rizal
to
be
permitted
to
return
to
the
philippines
unmolested
a
passport
was
finally
granted
to
him
and
he
set
out
for
manila
for
this
move
on
his
part
in
addition
to
the
natural
desire
to
be
among
his
own
people
two
special
reasons
appear
he
wished
to
investigate
and
stop
if
possible
the
unwarranted
use
of
his
name
in
taking
up
collections
that
always
remained
mysteriously
unaccounted
for
and
he
was
drawn
by
a
ruse
deliberately
planned
and
executed
in
that
his
mother
was
several
times
officiously
arrested
and
hustled
about
as
a
common
criminal
in
order
to
work
upon
the
son
filial
feelings
and
thus
get
him
back
within
reach
of
the
spanish
authority
which
as
subsequent
events
and
later
researches
have
shown
was
the
real
intention
in
issuing
the
passport
entirely
unsuspecting
any
ulterior
motive
however
in
a
few
days
after
his
arrival
he
convoked
a
motley
gathering
of
filipinos
of
all
grades
of
the
population
for
he
seems
to
have
been
only
slightly
acquainted
among
his
own
people
and
not
at
all
versed
in
the
mazy
walpurgis
dance
of
philippine
politics
and
laid
before
it
the
constitution
for
a
philippine
league
an
organization
looking
toward
greater
unity
among
the
filipinos
and
coöperation
for
economic
progress
this
was
no
doubt
the
result
of
his
observations
in
england
and
germany
and
despite
its
questionable
form
as
a
secret
society
for
political
and
economic
purposes
was
assuredly
a
step
in
the
right
direction
but
unfortunately
its
significance
was
beyond
the
comprehension
of
his
countrymen
most
of
whom
saw
in
it
only
an
opportunity
for
harassing
the
spanish
government
for
which
all
were
ready
enough
all
his
movements
were
closely
watched
and
a
few
days
after
his
return
he
was
arrested
on
the
charge
of
having
seditious
literature
in
his
baggage
the
friars
were
already
clamoring
for
his
blood
but
despujols
seems
to
have
been
more
in
sympathy
with
rizal
than
with
the
men
whose
tool
he
found
himself
forced
to
be
without
trial
rizal
was
ordered
deported
to
dapitan
a
small
settlement
on
the
northern
coast
of
mindanao
the
decree
ordering
this
deportation
and
the
destruction
of
all
copies
of
his
books
to
be
found
in
the
philippines
is
a
marvel
of
sophistry
since
in
the
words
of
a
spanish
writer
of
the
time
in
this
document
we
do
not
know
which
to
wonder
at
most
the
ingenuousness
of
the
for
in
this
decree
he
implicitly
acknowledges
his
weakness
and
proneness
to
error
or
the
candor
of
rizal
who
believed
that
all
the
way
was
strewn
with
roses
but
it
is
quite
evident
that
despujols
was
playing
a
double
game
of
which
he
seems
to
have
been
rather
ashamed
for
he
gave
strict
orders
that
copies
of
the
decree
should
be
withheld
from
rizal
in
dapitan
rizal
gave
himself
up
to
his
studies
and
such
medical
practice
as
sought
him
out
in
that
remote
spot
for
the
fame
of
his
skill
was
widely
extended
and
he
was
allowed
to
live
unmolested
under
parole
that
he
would
make
no
attempt
to
escape
in
company
with
a
jesuit
missionary
he
gathered
about
him
a
number
of
native
boys
and
conducted
a
practical
school
on
the
german
plan
at
the
same
time
indulging
in
religious
polemics
with
his
jesuit
acquaintances
by
correspondence
and
working
fitfully
on
some
compositions
which
were
never
completed
noteworthy
among
them
being
a
study
in
english
of
the
tagalog
verb
but
while
he
was
living
thus
quietly
in
dapitan
events
that
were
to
determine
his
fate
were
misshaping
themselves
in
manila
the
stone
had
been
loosened
on
the
and
was
bounding
on
in
mad
career

beyond
his
control

spelling

action
for

revolt
on
a
fixed
date
when
they
would
rise
simultaneously
take
possession
of
the
city
of

and
the
rest
were
better
left
to
the
imagination
for
they
had
been
reared
under
the
spanish
colonial
system
and
imitativeness
has
ever
been
pointed
out
as
a
cardinal
trait
in
the
filipino
character
no
quarter
was
to
be
asked
or
given
and
the
most
sacred
ties
even
of
consanguinity
were
to
be
disregarded
in
the
general
slaughter
to
the
inquiry
of
a
curious
neophyte
as
to
how
the
spaniards
were
to
be
distinguished
from
the
other
europeans
in
order
to
avoid
international
complications
dark
andres
replied
that
in
case
of
doubt
they
should
proceed
with
due
caution
but
should
take
good
care
that
they
made
no
mistakes
about
letting
any
of
the
escape
their
vengeance
the
higher
officials
of
the
government
were
to
be
taken
alive
as
hostages
while
the
friars
were
to
be
reserved
for
a
special
holocaust
on
bagumbayan
field
where
over
their
incinerated
remains
a
monument
would
be
erected
this
katipunan
seems
to
have
been
an
outgrowth
from
spanish
freemasonry
introduced
into
the
philippines
by
a
spaniard
named
morayta
and
marcelo
del
pilar
a
native
of
bulacan
province
who
was
the
practical
leader
of
the
filipinos
in
spain
but
who
died
there
in
just
as
he
was
setting
out
for
hongkong
to
mature
his
plans
for
a
general
uprising
to
expel
the
friar
orders
there
had
been
some
masonic
societies
in
the
islands
for
some
time
but
the
membership
had
been
limited
to
peninsulars
and
they
played
no
part
in
the
politics
of
the
time
but
about
filipinos
began
to
be
admitted
into
some
of
them
and
later
chiefly
through
the
exertions
of
pilar
lodges
exclusively
for
them
were
instituted
these
soon
began
to
display
great
activity
especially
in
the
transcendental
matter
of
collections
so
that
their
existence
became
a
source
of
care
to
the
government
and
a
nightmare
to
the
religious
orders
from
them
and
with
a
perversion
of
the
idea
in
rizal
it
was
an
easy
transition
to
the
katipunan
which
was
to
put
aside
all
pretense
of
reconciliation
with
spain
and
at
the
appointed
time
rise
to
exterminate
not
only
the
friars
but
also
all
the
spaniards
and
spanish
sympathizers
thus
to
bring
about
the
reign
of
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
under
the
benign
guidance
of
patriot
bonifacio
with
his
bolo
for
a
scepter
with
its
secrecy
and
mystic
forms
its
methods
of
threats
and
intimidation
the
katipunan
spread
rapidly
especially
among
the
tagalogs
the
most
intransigent
of
the
native
peoples
and
it
should
be
noted
the
ones
in
whose
territory
the
friars
were
the
principal
landlords
it
was
organized
on
the
triangle
plan
so
that
no
member
might
know
or
communicate
with
more
than
three
others
the
one
above
him
from
whom
he
received
his
information
and
instructions
and
two
below
to
whom
he
transmitted
them
the
initiations
were
conducted
with
great
secrecy
and
solemnity
calculated
to
inspire
the
new
members
with
awe
and
fear
the
initiate
after
a
series
of
ordeals
to
try
out
his
courage
and
resolution
swore
on
a
human
skull
a
terrific
oath
to
devote
his
life
and
energies
to
the
extermination
of
the
white
race
regardless
of
age
or
sex
and
later
affixed
to
it
his
signature
or
mark
usually
the
latter
with
his
own
blood
taken
from
an
incision
in
the
left
arm
or
left
breast
this
was
one
form
of
the
famous
blood
compact
which
if
history
reads
aright
played
so
important
a
part
in
the
assumption
of
sovereignty
over
the
philippines
by
legazpi
in
the
name
of
philip
ii
rizal
was
made
the
honorary
president
of
the
association
his
portrait
hung
in
all
the
and
the
magic
of
his
name
used
to
attract
the
easily
deluded
masses
who
were
in
a
state
of
agitated
ignorance
and
growing
unrest
ripe
for
any
movement
that
looked
and
especially
soon
after
the
organization
had
been
perfected
collections
began
to
be
taken
up
those
collections
were
never
overlooked
for
the
purpose
of
chartering
a
steamer
to
rescue
him
from
dapitan
and
transport
him
to
singapore
whence
he
might
direct
the
general
uprising
the
day
and
the
hour
for
which
were
fixed
by
bonifacio
for
august
at
six
sharp
in
the
evening
since
lack
of
precision
in
his
magnificent
programs
was
never
a
fault
of
that
bold
patriot
his
logic
being
as
severe
as
that
of
the
filipino
policeman
who
put
the
flag
at
on
good
friday
of
all
this
rizal
himself
was
of
course
entirely
ignorant
until
in
may
a
filipino
doctor
named
pio
valenzuela
a
creature
of
bonifacio
was
despatched
to
dapitan
taking
along
a
blind
man
as
a
pretext
for
the
visit
to
the
famous
oculist
to
lay
the
plans
before
him
for
his
consent
and
approval
rizal
expostulated
with
valenzuela
for
a
time
over
such
a
mad
and
hopeless
venture
which
would
only
bring
ruin
and
misery
upon
the
masses
and
then
is
said
to
have
very
humanly
lost
his
patience
ending
the
interview
in
so
bad
a
humor
and
with
words
so
offensive
that
the
deponent
who
had
gone
with
the
intention
of
remaining
there
a
month
took
the
steamer
on
the
following
day
for
return
to
manila
he
reported
secretly
to
bonifacio
who
bestowed
several
choice
tagalog
epithets
on
rizal
and
charged
his
envoy
to
say
nothing
about
the
failure
of
his
mission
but
rather
to
give
the
impression
that
he
had
been
successful
rizal
name
continued
to
be
used
as
the
shibboleth
of
the
insurrection
and
the
masses
were
made
to
believe
that
he
would
appear
as
their
leader
at
the
appointed
hour
vague
reports
from
police
officers
to
the
effect
that
something
unusual
in
the
nature
of
secret
societies
was
going
on
among
the
people
began
to
reach
the
government
but
no
great
attention
was
paid
to
them
until
the
evening
of
august
nineteenth
when
the
parish
priest
of
tondo
was
informed
by
the
of
one
of
the
that
she
had
just
learned
of
a
plot
to
massacre
all
the
spaniards
she
had
the
information
from
a
devoted
pupil
whose
brother
was
a
compositor
in
the
office
of
the
de
as
is
so
frequently
the
case
in
filipino
families
this
elder
sister
was
the
and
the
brother
insistent
requests
for
money
which
was
needed
by
him
to
meet
the
repeated
assessments
made
on
the
members
as
the
critical
hour
approached
awakened
her
curiosity
and
suspicion
to
such
an
extent
that
she
forced
him
to
confide
the
whole
plan
to
her
without
delay
she
divulged
it
to
her
patroness
who
in
turn
notified
the
curate
of
tondo
where
the
was
located
the
priest
called
in
two
officers
of
the
civil
guard
who
arrested
the
young
printer
frightened
a
confession
out
of
him
and
that
night
in
company
with
the
friar
searched
the
finding
secreted
there
several
lithographic
plates
for
printing
receipts
and
certificates
of
membership
in
the
katipunan
with
a
number
of
documents
giving
some
account
of
the
plot
then
the
spanish
population
went
wild
general
ramon
blanco
was
governor
and
seems
to
have
been
about
the
only
person
who
kept
his
head
at
all
he
tried
to
prevent
giving
so
irresponsible
a
movement
a
fictitious
importance
but
was
utterly
powerless
to
stay
the
clamor
for
blood
which
at
once
arose
loudest
on
the
part
of
those
alleged
ministers
of
the
gentle
christ
the
gates
of
the
old
walled
city
long
fallen
into
disuse
were
cleaned
and
put
in
order
martial
law
was
declared
and
wholesale
arrests
made
many
of
the
prisoners
were
confined
in
fort
santiago
one
batch
being
crowded
into
a
dungeon
for
which
the
only
ventilation
was
a
grated
opening
at
the
top
and
one
night
a
sergeant
of
the
guard
carelessly
spread
his
over
this
so
the
next
morning
some
asphyxiated
corpses
were
hauled
away
on
the
armed
insurrection
broke
out
at
caloocan
just
north
of
manila
from
time
immemorial
the
resort
of
bad
characters
from
all
the
country
round
and
the
center
of
brigandage
while
at
san
juan
del
monte
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
several
bloody
skirmishes
were
fought
a
few
days
later
with
the
civil
the
picked
police
force
bonifacio
had
been
warned
of
the
discovery
of
his
schemes
in
time
to
make
his
escape
and
flee
to
the
barrio
or
village
of
balintawak
a
few
miles
north
of
manila
thence
to
lead
the
attack
on
caloocan
and
inaugurate
the
reign
of
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
in
the
manner
in
which
philippine
insurrections
have
generally
had
a
habit
of
starting
with
the
murder
of
chinese
merchants
and
the
pillage
of
their
shops
he
had
from
the
first
reserved
for
himself
the
important
office
of
treasurer
in
the
katipunan
in
addition
to
being
on
occasions
president
and
at
all
times
its
ruling
spirit
so
he
now
established
himself
as
dictator
and
proceeded
to
appoint
a
magnificent
staff
most
of
whom
contrived
to
escape
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
reach
of
his
bolo
yet
he
drew
considerable
numbers
about
him
for
this
man
though
almost
entirely
unlettered
seems
to
have
been
quite
a
personality
among
his
own
people
especially
possessed
of
that
gift
of
oratory
in
his
native
tongue
to
which
the
malay
is
so
preeminently
susceptible
in
manila
a
special
tribunal
was
constituted
and
worked
steadily
sometimes
through
the
for
there
were
times
of
which
this
was
one
when
even
spanish
justice
could
be
swift
bagumbayan
began
to
be
a
veritable
field
of
blood
as
the
old
methods
of
repression
were
resorted
to
for
the
purpose
of
striking
terror
into
the
native
population
by
wholesale
executions
nor
did
the
ruling
powers
realize
that
the
time
for
such
methods
had
passed
it
was
a
case
of
colonial
methods
fallen
into
fretful
and
frantic
senility
so
in
all
this
wretched
business
it
is
doubtful
whim
to
pity
the
more
the
blind
stupidity
of
the
fossilized
conservatives
incontinently
throwing
an
empire
away
forfeiting
their
influence
over
a
people
whom
they
by
temperament
and
experience
should
have
been
fitted
to
control
and
govern
or
the
potential
cruelty
of
perverted
human
nature
in
the
dark
frankenstein
who
would
wreak
upon
the
rulers
in
their
decadent
days
the
most
hideous
of
the
methods
in
the
system
that
produced
him
as
he
planned
his
festive
holocaust
and
carmagnole
on
the
spot
where
every
spark
of
initiative
and
leadership
among
his
people
both
good
and
bad
had
been
summarily
and
ruthlessly
extinguished
there
is
at
least
a
world
of
reflection
in
it
for
the
rulers
of
men
in
the
meantime
rizal
wearying
of
the
quiet
life
in
dapitan
and
doubtless
foreseeing
the
impending
catastrophe
had
requested
leave
to
volunteer
his
services
as
a
physician
in
the
military
hospitals
of
cuba
of
the
horrors
and
sufferings
in
which
he
had
heard
general
blanco
at
once
gladly
acceded
to
this
request
and
had
him
brought
to
manila
but
unfortunately
the
boat
carrying
him
arrived
there
a
day
too
late
for
him
to
catch
the
regular
august
to
spain
so
he
was
kept
in
the
cruiser
a
prisoner
of
war
awaiting
the
next
transportation
while
he
was
thus
detained
the
katipunan
plot
was
discovered
and
the
rebellion
broke
out
he
was
accused
of
being
the
head
of
it
but
blanco
gave
him
a
personal
letter
completely
exonerating
him
from
any
complicity
in
the
outbreak
as
well
as
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
the
spanish
minister
of
war
he
was
placed
on
the
de
when
it
left
for
spain
on
september
third
and
traveled
at
first
as
a
passenger
at
singapore
he
was
advised
to
land
and
claim
british
protection
as
did
some
of
his
fellow
travelers
but
he
refused
to
do
so
saying
that
his
conscience
was
clear
as
the
name
of
rizal
had
constantly
recurred
during
the
trials
of
the
katipunan
suspects
the
military
tribunal
finally
issued
a
formal
demand
for
him
the
order
of
arrest
was
cabled
to
port
said
and
rizal
there
placed
in
solitary
confinement
for
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
arrived
at
barcelona
he
was
confined
in
the
grim
fortress
of
montjuich
where
by
a
curious
coincidence
the
governor
was
the
same
despujols
who
had
issued
the
decree
of
banishment
in
shortly
afterwards
he
was
placed
on
the
transport
which
was
bound
for
the
philippines
with
troops
blanco
having
at
last
been
stirred
to
action
strenuous
efforts
were
now
made
by
friends
in
london
to
have
him
removed
from
the
ship
at
singapore
but
the
british
authorities
declined
to
take
any
action
on
the
ground
that
he
was
on
a
spanish
warship
and
therefore
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
their
courts
the
arrived
at
manila
on
november
third
and
rizal
was
imprisoned
in
fort
santiago
while
a
special
tribunal
was
constituted
to
try
him
on
the
charges
of
carrying
on
and
propaganda
rebellion
sedition
and
the
formation
of
illegal
associations
some
other
charges
may
have
been
overlooked
in
the
hurry
and
excitement
it
would
be
almost
a
travesty
to
call
a
trial
the
proceedings
which
began
early
in
december
and
dragged
along
until
the
rizal
was
defended
by
a
young
spanish
officer
selected
by
him
from
among
a
number
designated
by
the
tribunal
who
chivalrously
performed
so
unpopular
a
duty
as
well
as
he
could
but
the
whole
affair
was
a
mockery
of
justice
for
the
spanish
government
in
the
philippines
had
finally
and
hopelessly
reached
the
condition
graphically
pictured
by
kipling
panic
that
shells
the
drifting
spar
loud
waste
with
none
to
check
mad
fear
that
rakes
a
scornful
star
or
sweeps
a
consort
deck
the
clamor
against
blanco
had
resulted
in
his
summary
removal
by
royal
decree
and
the
appointment
of
a
real
pacificator
camilo
polavieja
while
in
prison
rizal
prepared
an
address
to
those
of
his
countrymen
who
were
in
armed
rebellion
repudiating
the
use
of
his
name
and
deprecating
the
resort
to
violence
the
closing
words
are
a
compendium
of
his
life
and
beliefs
countrymen
i
have
given
proofs
as
well
as
the
best
of
you
of
desiring
liberty
for
our
country
and
i
continue
to
desire
it
but
i
place
as
a
premise
the
education
of
the
people
so
that
by
means
of
instruction
and
work
they
may
have
a
personality
of
their
own
and
that
they
may
make
themselves
worthy
of
that
same
liberty
in
my
writings
i
have
recommended
the
study
of
the
civic
virtues
without
which
there
can
be
no
redemption
i
have
also
written
and
my
words
have
been
repeated
that
reforms
to
be
fruitful
must
come
from
that
those
which
spring
from
are
uncertain
and
insecure
movements
imbued
with
these
ideas
i
can
not
do
less
than
condemn
and
i
do
condemn
this
absurd
savage
rebellion
planned
behind
my
back
which
dishonors
the
filipinos
and
discredits
those
who
can
speak
for
us
i
abominate
all
criminal
actions
and
refuse
any
kind
of
participation
in
them
pitying
with
all
my
heart
the
dupes
who
have
allowed
themselves
to
be
deceived
go
back
then
to
your
homes
and
may
god
forgive
those
who
have
acted
in
bad
faith
this
address
however
was
not
published
by
the
spanish
authorities
since
they
did
not
consider
it
patriotic
enough
instead
they
killed
the
writer
rizal
appeared
before
the
tribunal
bound
closely
guarded
by
two
peninsular
soldiers
but
maintained
his
serenity
throughout
and
answered
the
charges
in
a
straightforward
way
he
pointed
out
the
fact
that
he
had
never
taken
any
great
part
in
politics
having
even
quarreled
with
marcelo
del
pilar
the
active
leader
of
the
by
reason
of
those
perennial
subscriptions
and
that
during
the
time
he
was
accused
of
being
the
instigator
and
organizer
of
armed
rebellion
he
had
been
a
close
prisoner
in
dapitan
under
strict
surveillance
by
both
the
military
and
ecclesiastical
authorities
the
prosecutor
presented
a
lengthy
document
which
ran
mostly
to
words
about
the
only
definite
conclusion
laid
down
in
it
being
that
the
philippines
are
and
always
must
remain
spanish
territory
what
there
may
have
been
in
rizal
career
to
hang
such
a
conclusion
upon
is
not
quite
dear
but
at
any
rate
this
learned
legal
light
was
evidently
still
thinking
in
colors
on
the
map
serenely
unconscious
in
his
european
of
the
new
and
wonderful
development
in
the
western
hemisphere
humanity
militant
lincolnism
the
death
sentence
was
asked
but
the
longer
the
case
dragged
on
the
more
favorable
it
began
to
look
for
the
accused
so
the
president
of
the
tribunal
after
deciding
that
the
charges
had
been
proved
ordered
that
no
further
evidence
be
taken
rizal
betrayed
some
sunrise
when
his
doom
was
thus
foreshadowed
for
dreamer
that
he
was
he
seems
not
to
have
anticipated
such
a
fatal
eventuality
for
himself
he
did
not
lose
his
serenity
however
even
when
the
tribunal
promptly
brought
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
imposed
the
death
sentence
upon
which
polavieja
the
next
day
placed
his
fixing
the
morning
of
december
thirtieth
for
the
execution
so
rizal
fate
was
sealed
the
witnesses
against
him
in
so
far
as
there
was
any
substantial
testimony
at
all
had
been
his
own
countrymen
coerced
or
cajoled
into
making
statements
which
they
have
since
repudiated
as
false
and
which
in
some
cases
were
extorted
from
them
by
threats
and
even
torture
but
he
betrayed
very
little
emotion
even
maintaining
what
must
have
been
an
assumed
cheerfulness
only
one
reproach
is
recorded
that
he
had
been
made
a
dupe
of
that
he
had
been
deceived
by
every
one
even
the
and
his
old
jesuit
instructors
remained
with
him
in
the
or
and
largely
through
the
influence
of
an
image
of
the
sacred
heart
which
he
had
carved
as
a
schoolboy
it
is
claimed
that
a
reconciliation
with
the
church
was
effected
there
has
been
considerable
pragmatical
discussion
as
to
what
form
of
retraction
from
him
was
necessary
since
he
had
been
after
studying
in
europe
a
frank
freethinker
but
such
futile
polemics
may
safely
be
left
to
the
learned
doctors
that
he
was
reconciled
with
the
church
would
seem
to
be
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
just
before
the
execution
he
gave
legal
status
as
his
wife
to
the
woman
a
rather
remarkable
eurasian
adventuress
who
had
lived
with
him
in
dapitan
and
the
religious
ceremony
was
the
only
one
then
recognized
in
the
islands
the
greater
part
of
his
last
night
on
earth
was
spent
in
composing
a
chain
of
verse
no
very
majestic
flight
of
poesy
but
a
pathetic
monody
throbbing
with
patient
resignation
and
inextinguishable
hope
one
of
the
sweetest
saddest
ever
sung
thus
he
was
left
at
the
last
entirely
alone
as
soon
as
his
doom
became
certain
the
patriots
had
all
scurried
to
cover
one
gentle
poetaster
even
rushing
into
doggerel
verse
to
condemn
him
as
a
reversion
to
barbarism
the
wealthier
suspects
betook
themselves
to
other
lands
or
made
judicious
use
of
their
among
the
spanish
officials
the
better
classes
of
the
population
floundered
hopelessly
leaderless
in
the
confused
whirl
of
opinions
and
passions
while
the
voiceless
millions
for
whom
he
had
spoken
moved
on
in
dumb
uncomprehending
silence
he
had
lived
in
that
higher
dreamland
of
the
future
ahead
of
his
countrymen
ahead
even
of
those
who
assumed
to
be
the
mentors
of
his
people
and
he
must
learn
as
does
every
noble
soul
that
labors
to
make
the
bounds
of
freedom
wider
yet
the
bitter
lesson
that
if
not
all
the
woes
that
afflict
humanity
spring
from
man
own
stupid
selfishness
that
the
wresting
of
the
scepter
from
the
tyrant
is
often
the
least
of
the
task
that
the
bondman
comes
to
love
his
bonds
like
chillon
prisoner
his
very
chains
and
he
grow
friends
but
that
the
struggle
for
human
freedom
must
go
on
at
whatever
cost
in
circles
wave
after
wave
each
mightier
than
the
last
for
as
long
as
one
body
toils
in
fetters
or
one
mind
welters
in
blind
ignorance
either
of
the
base
delusion
or
the
despot
specious
illusion
there
can
be
no
final
security
for
any
free
man
or
his
children
or
his
children

was
one
of
those
magic
december
mornings
of
the
tropics
the
very
nuptials
of
earth

when
great
nature
seems
to
fling
herself
incontinently
into
creation
wrapping
the
world
in
a
brooding
calm
of
light
and
color
that
spain
chose
for
committing
political
suicide

in
the
streets
double
guards
were
placed
over
the
archiepiscopal
and
gubernatorial
palaces
the
calmest
man
in
all
manila
that
day
was
he
who
must
stand
before
the
two
special
and
unusual
features
are
to
be
noted
about
this
execution
all
the
principal
actors
were
filipinos
the
commander
of
the
troops
and
the
officer
directly
in
charge
of
the
execution
were
while
the
itself
was
drawn
from
a
local
native
regiment
though
it
is
true
that
on
this
occasion
a
squad
of
peninsular
armed
with
loaded
mausers
stood
directly
behind
them
to
see
that
they
failed
not
in
their
duty
again
there
was
but
one
victim
for
it
seems
to
have
ever
been
the
custom
of
the
spanish
rulers
to
associate
in
these
gruesome
affairs
some
real
criminals
with
the
political
offenders
no
doubt
with
the
intentional
purpose
of
confusing
the
issue
in
the
general
mind
rizal
standing
alone
the
occasion
of
so
much
hurried
preparation
and
fearful
precaution
is
a
pathetic
testimonial
to
the
degree
of
incapacity
into
which
the
ruling
powers
had
fallen
even
in
chicanery
after
bidding
to
his
sister
and
making
final
disposition
regarding
some
personal
property
the
doomed
man
under
close
guard
walked
calmly
even
cheerfully
from
fort
santiago
along
the
malecon
to
the
luneta
accompanied
by
his
jesuit
confessors
arrived
there
he
thanked
those
about
him
for
their
kindness
and
requested
the
officer
in
charge
to
allow
him
to
face
the
since
he
had
never
been
a
traitor
to
spain
this
the
officer
declined
to
permit
for
the
order
was
to
shoot
him
in
the
back
rizal
assented
with
a
slight
protest
pointed
out
to
the
soldiers
the
spot
in
his
back
at
which
they
should
aim
and
with
a
firm
step
took
his
place
in
front
of
them
then
occurred
an
act
almost
too
hideous
to
record
there
he
stood
expecting
a
volley
of
remington
bullets
in
his
back
time
was
and
life
stream
ebbed
to
eternity
flood
when
the
military
surgeon
stepped
forward
and
asked
if
he
might
feel
his
pulse
rizal
extended
his
left
hand
and
the
officer
remarked
that
he
could
not
understand
how
a
man
pulse
could
beat
normally
at
such
a
terrific
moment
the
victim
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
let
the
hand
fall
again
to
his
side
latin
refinement
could
be
no
further
refined
a
moment
later
there
he
lay
on
his
right
side
his
spurting
over
the
luneta
curb
eyes
wide
open
fixedly
staring
at
that
heaven
where
the
priests
had
taught
all
those
centuries
agone
that
justice
abides
the
troops
filed
past
the
body
for
the
most
part
silently
while
desultory
cries
of
españa
from
among
the
patriotic
filipino
volunteers
were
summarily
hushed
by
a
spanish
stern
rebuke
silence
you
rabble
to
drown
out
the
fitful
cheers
and
the
audible
murmurs
the
bands
struck
up
spanish
national
airs
stranger
no
man
and
system
ever
had
carnival
revelers
now
dance
about
the
scene
and
filipino
schoolboys
play
baseball
over
that
same
spot
a
few
days
later
another
execution
was
held
on
that
spot
of
members
of
the
some
of
them
characters
that
would
have
richly
deserved
shooting
at
any
place
or
time
according
to
existing
standards
but
notable
among
them
there
knelt
as
to
his
orisons
francisco
roxas
millionaire
capitalist
who
may
be
regarded
as
the
social
and
economic
head
of
the
filipino
people
as
rizal
was
fitted
to
be
their
intellectual
leader
shades
of
anda
and
vargas
out
there
at
balintawak
rather
fitly
the
home
of
the
not
three
hours
march
from
this
same
spot
on
the
very
edge
of
the
city
andres
bonifacio
and
his
literally
sansculottic
gangs
of
cutthroats
were
almost
with
impunity
soiling
the
fair
name
of
freedom
with
murder
and
mutilation
rape
and
rapine
awakening
the
worst
passions
of
an
excitable
impulsive
people
destroying
that
essential
respect
for
law
and
order
which
to
restore
would
take
a
holocaust
of
fire
and
blood
with
a
generation
of
severe
training
unquestionably
did
rizal
demonstrate
himself
to
be
a
seer
and
prophet
when
he
applied
to
such
a
system
the
story
of
babylon
and
the
fateful
handwriting
on
the
wall
but
forces
had
been
loosed
that
would
not
be
so
suppressed
the
time
had
gone
by
when
such
wild
methods
of
repression
would
serve
the
destruction
of
the
native
leaders
culminating
in
the
executions
of
rizal
and
roxas
produced
a
by
rousing
the
tagalogs
good
and
bad
alike
to
desperate
fury
and
the
aftermath
was
frightful
the
better
classes
were
driven
to
take
part
in
the
rebellion
and
cavite
especially
became
a
veritable
as
the
contest
settled
down
into
a
hideous
struggle
for
mutual
extermination
dark
andres
went
his
wild
way
to
perish
by
the
violence
he
had
himself
invoked
a
prey
to
the
rising
ambition
of
a
young
leader
of
considerable
culture
and
ability
a
schoolmaster
named
emilio
aguinaldo
his
katipunan
hovered
fitfully
around
manila
for
a
time
even
drawing
to
itself
in
their
desperation
some
of
the
better
elements
of
the
population
only
to
find
itself
sold
out
and
deserted
by
its
leaders
dying
away
for
a
time
but
later
under
changed
conditions
it
reappeared
in
strange
metamorphosis
as
the
for
the
largest
number
of
filipinos
who
have
ever
gathered
together
for
a
common
purpose
and
then
finally
went
down
before
those
thin
grim
lines
in
khaki
with
sharp
and
sharpest
shot
clearing
away
the
wreck
of
the
old
blazing
the
way
for
the
new

broadening
sweep
of
democracy

a

of
so
malignant
a
character
that
the

irritates
it
and

in
it
the

pains
thus
how
many
times
when

i
have
wished
to
call
thee

to
accompany
me

thee
with

thy

itself
showing
a
social
cancer
like
to
that
other
desiring
thy
welfare
which
is
our
own
and
seeking
the
best
treatment
i
will
do
with
thee
what
the
ancients
did
with
their
sick
exposing
them
on
the
steps
of
the
temple
so
that
every
one
who
came
to
invoke
the
divinity
might
offer
them
a
remedy
and
to
this
end
i
will
strive
to
reproduce
thy
condition
faithfully
without
discriminations
i
will
raise
a
part
of
the
veil
that
covers
the
evil
sacrificing
to

don
santiago
de
los
santos
popularly
known
as
capitan
tiago
gave
a
dinner
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
he
had
made
the
announcement
only
that
afternoon
it
was
already
the
sole
topic
of
conversation
in
binondo
and
adjacent
districts
and
even
in
the
walled
city
for
at
that
time
capitan
tiago
was
considered
one
of
the
most
hospitable
of
men
and
it
was
well
known
that
his
house
like
his
country
shut
its
doors
against
nothing
except
commerce
and
all
new
or
bold
ideas
like
an
electric
shock
the
announcement
ran
through
the
world
of
parasites
bores
and
whom
god
in
his
infinite
bounty
creates
and
so
kindly
multiplies
in
manila
some
looked
at
once
for
others
for
buttons
and
cravats
but
all
were
especially
concerned
about
how
to
greet
the
master
of
the
house
in
the
most
familiar
tone
in
order
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
ancient
friendship
or
if
occasion
should
arise
to
excuse
a
late
arrival
this
dinner
was
given
in
a
house
on
calle
anloague
and
although
we
do
not
remember
the
number
we
will
describe
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
may
still
be
recognized
provided
the
earthquakes
have
not
destroyed
it
we
do
not
believe
that
its
owner
has
had
it
torn
down
for
such
labors
are
generally
entrusted
to
god
or
nature
which
powers
hold
the
contracts
also
for
many
of
the
projects
of
our
government
it
is
a
rather
large
building
in
the
style
of
many
in
the
country
and
fronts
upon
the
arm
of
the
pasig
which
is
known
to
some
as
the
binondo
river
and
which
like
all
the
streams
in
manila
plays
the
varied
rôles
of
bath
sewer
laundry
fishery
means
of
transportation
and
communication
and
even
drinking
water
if
the
chinese
finds
it
convenient
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
in
the
distance
of
nearly
a
mile
this
important
artery
of
the
district
where
traffic
is
most
dense
and
movement
most
deafening
can
boast
of
only
one
wooden
bridge
which
is
out
of
repair
on
one
side
for
six
months
and
impassable
on
the
other
for
the
rest
of
the
year
so
that
during
the
hot
season
the
ponies
take
advantage
of
this
permanent
to
jump
off
the
bridge
into
the
water
to
the
great
surprise
of
the
abstracted
mortal
who
may
be
dozing
inside
the
carriage
or
philosophizing
upon
the
progress
of
the
age
the
house
of
which
we
are
speaking
is
somewhat
low
and
not
exactly
correct
in
all
its
lines
whether
the
architect
who
built
it
was
afflicted
with
poor
eyesight
or
whether
the
earthquakes
and
typhoons
have
twisted
it
out
of
shape
no
one
can
say
with
certainty
a
wide
staircase
with
green
newels
and
carpeted
steps
leads
from
the
tiled
entrance
up
to
the
main
floor
between
rows
of
set
upon
pedestals
of
and
fantastically
decorated
chinese
porcelain
since
there
are
neither
porters
nor
servants
who
demand
invitation
cards
we
will
go
in
o
you
who
read
this
whether
friend
or
foe
if
you
are
attracted
by
the
strains
of
the
orchestra
the
lights
or
the
suggestive
rattling
of
dishes
knives
and
forks
and
if
you
wish
to
see
what
such
a
gathering
is
like
in
the
distant
pearl
of
the
orient
gladly
and
for
my
own
comfort
i
should
spare
you
this
description
of
the
house
were
it
not
of
great
importance
since
we
mortals
in
general
are
very
much
like
tortoises
we
are
esteemed
and
classified
according
to
our
shells
in
this
and
still
other
respects
the
mortals
of
the
philippines
in
particular
also
resemble
tortoises
if
we
go
up
the
stairs
we
immediately
find
ourselves
in
a
spacious
hallway
called
there
for
some
unknown
reason
the
which
tonight
serves
as
the
and
at
the
same
time
affords
a
place
for
the
orchestra
in
the
center
a
large
table
profusely
and
expensively
decorated
seems
to
beckon
to
the
with
sweet
promises
while
it
threatens
the
bashful
maiden
the
simple
with
two
mortal
hours
in
the
company
of
strangers
whose
language
and
conversation
usually
have
a
very
restricted
and
special
character
contrasted
with
these
terrestrial
preparations
are
the
motley
paintings
on
the
walls
representing
religious
matters
such
as
purgatory
hell
the
last
judgment
the
death
of
the
just
and
the
death
of
the
sinner
at
the
back
of
the
room
fastened
in
a
splendid
and
elegant
framework
in
the
renaissance
style
possibly
by
arévalo
is
a
glass
case
in
which
are
seen
the
figures
of
two
old
women
the
inscription
on
this
reads
our
lady
of
peace
and
prosperous
voyages
who
is
worshiped
in
antipolo
visiting
in
the
disguise
of
a
beggar
the
holy
and
renowned
capitana
inez
during
her
sickness
while
the
work
reveals
little
taste
or
art
yet
it
possesses
in
compensation
an
extreme
realism
for
to
judge
from
the
yellow
and
bluish
tints
of
her
face
the
sick
woman
seems
to
be
already
a
decaying
corpse
and
the
glasses
and
other
objects
accompaniments
of
long
illness
are
so
minutely
reproduced
that
even
their
contents
may
be
distinguished
in
looking
at
these
pictures
which
excite
the
appetite
and
inspire
gay
bucolic
ideas
one
may
perhaps
be
led
to
think
that
the
malicious
host
is
well
acquainted
with
the
characters
of
the
majority
of
those
who
are
to
sit
at
his
table
and
that
in
order
to
conceal
his
own
way
of
thinking
he
has
hung
from
the
ceiling
costly
chinese
lanterns
without
birds
red
green
and
blue
globes
of
frosted
glass
faded
and
dried
and
inflated
fishes
which
they
call
the
view
is
closed
on
the
side
of
the
river
by
curious
wooden
arches
half
chinese
and
half
european
affording
glimpses
of
a
terrace
with
arbors
and
bowers
faintly
lighted
by
paper
lanterns
of
many
colors
in
the
sala
among
massive
mirrors
and
gleaming
chandeliers
the
guests
are
assembled
here
on
a
raised
platform
stands
a
grand
piano
of
great
price
which
tonight
has
the
additional
virtue
of
not
being
played
upon
here
hanging
on
the
wall
is
an
of
a
handsome
man
in
full
dress
rigid
erect
straight
as
the
tasseled
cane
he
holds
in
his
stiff
fingers
the
whole
seeming
to
say
ahem
see
how
well
dressed
and
how
dignified
i
am
the
furnishings
of
the
room
are
elegant
and
perhaps
uncomfortable
and
unhealthful
since
the
master
of
the
house
would
consider
not
so
much
the
comfort
and
health
of
his
guests
as
his
own
ostentation
a
terrible
thing
is
dysentery
he
would
say
to
them
but
you
are
sitting
in
european
chairs
and
that
is
something
you
do
find
every
day
this
room
is
almost
filled
with
people
the
men
being
separated
from
the
women
as
in
synagogues
and
catholic
churches
the
women
consist
of
a
number
of
filipino
and
spanish
maidens
who
when
they
open
their
mouths
to
yawn
instantly
cover
them
with
their
fans
and
who
murmur
only
a
few
words
to
each
other
any
conversation
ventured
upon
dying
out
in
monosyllables
like
the
sounds
heard
in
a
house
at
night
sounds
made
by
the
rats
and
lizards
is
it
perhaps
the
different
likenesses
of
our
lady
hanging
on
the
walls
that
force
them
to
silence
and
a
religious
demeanor
or
is
it
that
the
women
here
are
an
exception
a
cousin
of
capitan
tiago
a
old
woman
who
speaks
spanish
quite
badly
is
the
only
one
receiving
the
ladies
to
offer
to
the
spanish
ladies
a
plate
of
cigars
and
to
extend
her
hand
to
her
countrywomen
to
be
kissed
exactly
as
the
friars
do
this
is
the
sum
of
her
courtesy
her
policy
the
poor
old
lady
soon
became
bored
and
taking
advantage
of
the
noise
of
a
plate
breaking
rushed
precipitately
away
muttering
just
wait
you
rascals
and
failed
to
reappear
the
men
for
their
part
are
making
more
of
a
stir
some
cadets
in
one
corner
are
conversing
in
a
lively
manner
but
in
low
tones
looking
around
now
and
then
to
point
out
different
persons
in
the
room
while
they
laugh
more
or
less
openly
among
themselves
in
contrast
two
foreigners
dressed
in
white
are
promenading
silently
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
with
their
hands
crossed
behind
their
backs
like
the
bored
passengers
on
the
deck
of
a
ship
all
the
interest
and
the
greatest
animation
proceed
from
a
group
composed
of
two
priests
two
civilians
and
a
soldier
who
are
seated
around
a
small
table
on
which
are
seen
bottles
of
wine
and
english
biscuits
the
soldier
a
tall
elderly
lieutenant
with
an
austere
countenance
a
duke
of
alva
straggling
behind
in
the
roster
of
the
civil
guard
talks
little
but
in
a
harsh
curt
way
one
of
the
priests
a
youthful
dominican
friar
handsome
graceful
polished
as
the
eyeglasses
he
wears
maintains
a
premature
gravity
he
is
the
curate
of
binondo
and
has
been
in
former
years
a
professor
in
the
college
of
san
juan
de
letran
where
he
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
being
a
consummate
dialectician
so
much
so
that
in
the
days
when
the
sons
of
guzman
still
dared
to
match
themselves
in
subtleties
with
laymen
the
able
disputant
de
luna
had
never
been
able
either
to
catch
or
to
confuse
him
the
distinctions
made
by
fray
sibyla
leaving
his
opponent
in
the
situation
of
a
fisherman
who
tries
to
catch
eels
with
a
lasso
the
dominican
says
little
appearing
to
weigh
his
words
quite
in
contrast
the
other
priest
a
franciscan
talks
much
and
gesticulates
more
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
his
hair
is
beginning
to
turn
gray
he
seems
to
be
preserving
well
his
robust
constitution
while
his
regular
features
his
rather
disquieting
glance
his
wide
jaws
and
herculean
frame
give
him
the
appearance
of
a
roman
noble
in
disguise
and
make
us
involuntarily
recall
one
of
those
three
monks
of
whom
heine
tells
in
his
gods
in
exile
who
at
the
september
equinox
in
the
tyrol
used
to
cross
a
lake
at
midnight
and
each
time
place
in
the
hand
of
the
poor
boatman
a
silver
piece
cold
as
ice
which
left
him
full
of
terror
but
fray
damaso
is
not
so
mysterious
as
they
were
he
is
full
of
merriment
and
if
the
tone
of
his
voice
is
rough
like
that
of
a
man
who
has
never
had
occasion
to
correct
himself
and
who
believes
that
whatever
he
says
is
holy
and
above
improvement
still
his
frank
merry
laugh
wipes
out
this
disagreeable
impression
and
even
obliges
us
to
pardon
his
showing
to
the
room
bare
feet
and
hairy
legs
that
would
make
the
fortune
of
a
mendieta
in
the
quiapo
fairs
one
of
the
civilians
is
a
very
small
man
with
a
black
beard
the
only
thing
notable
about
him
being
his
nose
which
to
judge
from
its
size
ought
not
to
belong
to
him
the
other
is
a
rubicund
youth
who
seems
to
have
arrived
but
recently
in
the
country
with
him
the
franciscan
is
carrying
on
a
lively
discussion
you
see
the
friar
was
saying
when
you
been
here
a
few
months
you
be
convinced
of
what
i
say
it
one
thing
to
govern
in
madrid
and
another
to
live
in
the
philippines
but
i
for
example
continued
fray
damaso
raising
his
voice
still
higher
to
prevent
the
other
from
speaking
i
for
example
who
can
look
back
over
years
of
bananas
and
know
whereof
i
speak
do
come
at
me
with
theories
and
fine
speeches
for
i
know
the
indian
mark
well
that
the
moment
i
arrived
in
the
country
i
was
assigned
to
a
toxin
small
it
is
true
but
especially
devoted
to
agriculture
i
did
understand
tagalog
very
well
then
but
i
was
soon
confessing
the
women
and
we
understood
one
another
and
they
came
to
like
me
so
well
that
three
years
later
when
i
was
transferred
to
another
and
larger
town
made
vacant
by
the
death
of
the
native
curate
all
fell
to
weeping
they
heaped
gifts
upon
me
they
escorted
me
with
music
but
that
only
goes
to
show
wait
wait
do
be
so
hasty
my
successor
remained
a
shorter
time
and
when
he
left
he
had
more
attendance
more
tears
and
more
music
yet
he
had
been
more
given
to
whipping
and
had
raised
the
fees
in
the
parish
to
almost
double
but
you
will
allow
me
but
that
is
all
i
stayed
in
the
town
of
san
diego
twenty
years
and
it
has
been
only
a
few
months
since
i
left
it
here
he
showed
signs
of
chagrin
twenty
years
no
one
can
deny
are
more
than
sufficient
to
get
acquainted
with
a
town
san
diego
has
a
population
of
six
thousand
souls
and
i
knew
every
inhabitant
as
well
as
if
i
had
been
his
mother
and
i
knew
in
which
foot
this
one
was
lame
where
the
shoe
pinched
that
one
who
was
courting
that
girl
what
affairs
she
had
had
and
with
whom
who
was
the
real
father
of
the
child
and
so
on
for
i
was
the
confessor
of
every
last
one
and
they
took
care
not
to
fail
in
their
duty
our
host
santiago
will
tell
you
whether
i
am
speaking
the
truth
for
he
has
a
lot
of
land
there
and
that
was
where
we
first
became
friends
well
then
you
may
see
what
the
indian
is
when
i
left
i
was
escorted
by
only
a
few
old
women
and
some
of
the
tertiary
brethren
and
that
after
i
had
been
there
twenty
years
but
i
do
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
the
abolition
of
the
tobacco
monopoly
ventured
the
rubicund
youth
taking
advantage
of
the
franciscan
pausing
to
drink
a
glass
of
sherry
fray
damaso
was
so
greatly
surprised
that
he
nearly
let
his
glass
fall
he
remained
for
a
moment
staring
fixedly
at
the
young
man
what
how
that
he
was
finally
able
to
exclaim
in
great
wonderment
is
it
possible
that
you
do
see
it
as
clear
as
day
do
you
see
my
son
that
all
this
proves
plainly
that
the
reforms
of
the
ministers
are
irrational
it
was
now
the
youth
turn
to
look
perplexed
the
lieutenant
wrinkled
his
eyebrows
a
little
more
and
the
small
man
nodded
toward
fray
damaso
equivocally
the
dominican
contented
himself
with
almost
turning
his
back
on
the
whole
group
do
you
really
believe
so
the
young
man
at
length
asked
with
great
seriousness
as
he
looked
at
the
friar
with
curiosity
do
i
believe
so
as
i
believe
the
gospel
the
indian
is
so
indolent
ah
pardon
me
for
interrupting
you
said
the
young
man
lowering
his
voice
and
drawing
his
chair
a
little
closer
but
you
have
said
something
that
awakens
all
my
interest
does
this
indolence
actually
naturally
exist
among
the
natives
or
is
there
some
truth
in
what
a
foreign
traveler
says
that
with
this
indolence
we
excuse
our
own
as
well
as
our
backwardness
and
our
colonial
system
he
referred
to
other
colonies
whose
inhabitants
belong
to
the
same
race
bah
jealousy
ask
señor
laruja
who
also
knows
this
country
ask
him
if
there
is
any
equal
to
the
ignorance
and
indolence
of
the
indian
it
true
affirmed
the
little
man
who
was
referred
to
as
señor
laruja
in
no
part
of
the
world
can
you
find
any
one
more
indolent
than
the
indian
in
no
part
of
the
world
nor
more
vicious
nor
more
ungrateful
nor
more
unmannerly
the
rubicund
youth
began
to
glance
about
nervously
gentlemen
he
whispered
i
believe
that
we
are
in
the
house
of
an
indian
those
young
ladies
bah
do
be
so
apprehensive
santiago
does
consider
himself
an
indian
and
besides
he
not
here
and
what
if
he
were
these
are
the
nonsensical
ideas
of
the
newcomers
let
a
few
months
pass
and
you
will
change
your
opinion
after
you
have
attended
a
lot
of
fiestas
and
slept
on
cots
and
eaten
your
fill
of
ah
is
this
thing
that
you
call
a
variety
of
lotus
which
makes
people
er
forgetful
nothing
of
the
kind
exclaimed
fray
damaso
with
a
smile
getting
absurd
is
a
stew
of
chicken
and
squash
how
long
has
it
been
since
you
got
here
four
days
responded
the
youth
rather
offended
have
you
come
as
a
government
employee
no
sir
i
come
at
my
own
expense
to
study
the
country
man
what
a
rare
bird
exclaimed
fray
damaso
staring
at
him
with
curiosity
to
come
at
one
own
expense
and
for
such
foolishness
what
a
wonder
when
there
are
so
many
books
and
with
two
fingerbreadths
of
forehead
many
have
written
books
as
big
as
that
with
two
fingerbreadths
of
forehead
the
dominican
here
brusquely
broke
in
upon
the
conversation
did
your
reverence
fray
damaso
say
that
you
had
been
twenty
years
in
the
town
of
san
diego
and
that
you
had
left
it
was
your
reverence
satisfied
with
the
town
at
this
question
which
was
put
in
a
very
natural
and
almost
negligent
tone
fray
damaso
suddenly
lost
all
his
merriment
and
stopped
laughing
no
he
grunted
dryly
and
let
himself
back
heavily
against
the
back
of
his
chair
the
dominican
went
on
in
a
still
more
indifferent
tone
it
must
be
painful
to
leave
a
town
where
one
has
been
for
twenty
years
and
which
he
knows
as
well
as
the
clothes
he
wears
i
certainly
was
sorry
to
leave
kamiling
and
that
after
i
had
been
there
only
a
few
months
but
my
superiors
did
it
for
the
good
of
the
orders
for
my
own
good
fray
damaso
for
the
first
time
that
evening
seemed
to
be
very
thoughtful
suddenly
he
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
with
a
heavy
breath
exclaimed
either
religion
is
a
fact
or
it
is
not
that
is
either
the
curates
are
free
or
they
are
not
the
country
is
going
to
ruin
it
is
lost
and
again
he
struck
the
arm
of
his
chair
everybody
in
the
sala
turned
toward
the
group
with
astonished
looks
the
dominican
raised
his
head
to
stare
at
the
franciscan
from
under
his
glasses
the
two
foreigners
paused
a
moment
stared
with
an
expression
of
mingled
severity
and
reproof
then
immediately
continued
their
promenade
he
in
a
bad
humor
because
you
have
treated
him
with
deference
murmured
señor
laruja
into
the
ear
of
the
rubicund
youth
what
does
your
reverence
mean
what
the
trouble
inquired
the
dominican
and
the
lieutenant
at
the
same
time
but
in
different
tones
that
why
so
many
calamities
come
the
ruling
powers
support
heretics
against
the
ministers
of
god
continued
the
franciscan
raising
his
heavy
fists
what
do
you
mean
again
inquired
the
frowning
lieutenant
half
rising
from
his
chair
what
do
i
mean
repeated
fray
damaso
raising
his
voice
and
facing
the
lieutenant
i
tell
you
what
i
mean
i
yes
i
mean
to
say
that
when
a
priest
throws
out
of
his
cemetery
the
corpse
of
a
heretic
no
one
not
even
the
king
himself
has
any
right
to
interfere
and
much
less
to
impose
any
punishment
but
a
little
general
a
little
general
calamity
padre
his
excellency
is
the
patron
shouted
the
soldier
rising
to
his
feet
excellency
patron
what
of
that
retorted
the
franciscan
also
rising
in
other
times
he
would
have
been
dragged
down
a
staircase
as
the
religious
orders
once
did
with
the
impious
governor
bustamente
those
were
indeed
the
days
of
faith
i
warn
you
that
i
ca
permit
this
his
excellency
represents
his
majesty
the
king
king
or
rook
what
difference
does
that
make
for
us
there
is
no
king
other
than
the
legitimate
halt
shouted
the
lieutenant
in
a
threatening
tone
as
if
he
were
commanding
his
soldiers
either
you
withdraw
what
you
have
said
or
tomorrow
i
will
report
it
to
his
excellency
go
ahead
right
now
go
on
was
the
sarcastic
rejoinder
of
fray
damaso
as
he
approached
the
officer
with
clenched
fists
do
you
think
that
because
i
wear
the
cloth
i
afraid
go
now
while
i
can
lend
you
my
carriage
the
dispute
was
taking
a
ludicrous
turn
but
fortunately
the
dominican
intervened
gentlemen
he
began
in
an
authoritative
tone
and
with
the
nasal
twang
that
so
well
becomes
the
friars
you
must
not
confuse
things
or
seek
for
offenses
where
there
are
none
we
must
distinguish
in
the
words
of
fray
damaso
those
of
the
man
from
those
of
the
priest
the
latter
as
such
can
never
give
offense
because
they
spring
from
absolute
truth
while
in
those
of
the
man
there
is
a
secondary
distinction
to
be
made
those
which
he
utters
those
which
he
utters
but
not
and
those
which
he
does
utter
these
last
are
the
only
ones
that
can
really
offend
and
only
according
to
whether
they
preexisted
as
a
motive
or
arose
solely
in
the
heat
of
the
discussion
if
there
really
exist
but
i
by
and
for
my
own
part
understand
his
motives
padre
sibyla
broke
in
the
old
soldier
who
saw
himself
about
to
be
entangled
in
so
many
distinctions
that
he
feared
lest
he
might
still
be
held
to
blame
i
understand
the
motives
about
which
your
reverence
is
going
to
make
distinctions
during
the
absence
of
padre
damaso
from
san
diego
his
coadjutor
buried
the
body
of
an
extremely
worthy
individual
yes
sir
extremely
worthy
for
i
had
had
dealings
with
him
many
times
and
had
been
entertained
in
his
house
what
if
he
never
went
to
confession
what
does
that
matter
neither
do
i
go
to
confession
but
to
say
that
he
committed
suicide
is
a
lie
a
slander
a
man
such
as
he
was
who
has
a
son
upon
whom
he
centers
his
affection
and
hopes
a
man
who
has
faith
in
god
who
recognizes
his
duties
to
society
a
just
and
honorable
man
does
not
commit
suicide
this
much
i
will
say
and
will
refrain
from
expressing
the
rest
of
my
thoughts
here
so
please
your
reverence
then
turning
his
back
on
the
franciscan
he
went
on
now
then
this
priest
on
his
return
to
the
town
after
maltreating
the
poor
coadjutor
had
the
corpse
dug
up
and
taken
away
from
the
cemetery
to
be
buried
i
do
know
where
the
people
of
san
diego
were
cowardly
enough
not
to
protest
although
it
is
true
that
few
knew
of
the
outrage
the
dead
man
had
no
relatives
there
and
his
only
son
was
in
europe
but
his
excellency
learned
of
the
affair
and
as
he
is
an
upright
man
asked
for
some
punishment
and
padre
damaso
was
transferred
to
a
better
town
that
all
there
is
to
it
now
your
reverence
can
make
your
distinctions
so
saying
he
withdrew
from
the
group
i
sorry
that
i
inadvertently
brought
up
so
delicate
a
subject
said
padre
sibyla
sadly
but
after
all
if
there
has
been
a
gain
in
the
change
of
towns
how
is
there
to
be
a
gain
and
what
of
all
the
things
that
are
lost
in
moving
the
letters
and
the
and
everything
that
is
mislaid
interrupted
fray
damaso
stammering
in
the
vain
effort
to
control
his
anger
little
by
little
the
party
resumed
its
former
tranquillity
other
guests
had
come
in
among
them
a
lame
old
spaniard
of
mild
and
inoffensive
aspect
leaning
on
the
arm
of
an
elderly
filipina
who
was
resplendent
in
frizzes
and
paint
and
a
european
gown
the
group
welcomed
them
heartily
and
doctor
de
espadaña
and
his
señora
the
doña
victorina
took
their
seats
among
our
acquaintances
some
newspaper
reporters
and
shopkeepers
greeted
one
another
and
moved
about
aimlessly
without
knowing
just
what
to
do
but
can
you
tell
me
señor
laruja
what
kind
of
man
our
host
is
inquired
the
rubicund
youth
i
have
been
introduced
to
him
yet
they
say
that
he
has
gone
out
i
have
seen
him
either
there
no
need
of
introductions
here
volunteered
fray
damaso
santiago
is
made
of
the
right
stuff
no
he
not
the
man
who
invented
gunpowder
added
laruja
you
too
señor
laruja
exclaimed
doña
victorina
in
mild
reproach
as
she
fanned
herself
how
could
the
poor
man
invent
gunpowder
if
as
is
said
the
chinese
invented
it
centuries
ago
the
chinese
are
you
crazy
cried
fray
damaso
out
with
you
a
franciscan
one
of
my
order
fray
savalls
invented
it
in
the
ah
the
seventh
century
a
franciscan
well
he
must
have
been
a
missionary
in
china
that
padre
savalls
replied
the
lady
who
did
not
thus
easily
part
from
her
beliefs
schwartz
perhaps
you
mean
señora
said
fray
sibyla
without
looking
at
her
i
do
know
fray
damaso
said
a
franciscan
and
i
was
only
repeating
well
savalls
or
chevas
what
does
it
matter
the
difference
of
a
letter
does
make
him
a
chinaman
replied
the
franciscan
in
bad
humor
and
in
the
fourteenth
century
not
the
seventh
added
the
dominican
in
a
tone
of
correction
as
if
to
mortify
the
pride
of
the
other
friar
well
neither
does
a
century
more
or
less
make
him
a
dominican
do
get
angry
your
reverence
admonished
padre
sibyla
smiling
so
much
the
better
that
he
did
invent
it
so
as
to
save
his
brethren
the
trouble
and
did
you
say
padre
sibyla
that
it
was
in
the
fourteenth
century
asked
doña
victorina
with
great
interest
was
that
before
or
after
christ
fortunately
for
the
individual
questioned
two
persons
entered
the
room
chapter
ii
crisostomo
ibarra
it
was
not
two
beautiful
and
young
women
that
attracted
the
attention
of
all
even
including
fray
sibyla
nor
was
it
his
excellency
the
with
his
staff
that
the
lieutenant
should
start
from
his
abstraction
and
take
a
couple
of
steps
forward
or
that
fray
damaso
should
look
as
if
turned
to
stone
it
was
simply
the
original
of
the
leading
by
the
hand
a
young
man
dressed
in
deep
mourning
good
evening
gentlemen
good
evening
padre
were
the
greetings
of
capitan
tiago
as
he
kissed
the
hands
of
the
priests
who
forgot
to
bestow
upon
him
their
benediction
the
dominican
had
taken
off
his
glasses
to
stare
at
the
newly
arrived
youth
while
fray
damaso
was
pale
and
unnaturally
i
have
the
honor
of
presenting
to
you
don
crisostomo
ibarra
the
son
of
my
deceased
friend
went
on
capitan
tiago
the
young
gentleman
has
just
arrived
from
europe
and
i
went
to
meet
him
at
the
mention
of
the
name
exclamations
were
heard
the
lieutenant
forgot
to
pay
his
respects
to
his
host
and
approached
the
young
man
looking
him
over
from
head
to
foot
the
young
man
himself
at
that
moment
was
exchanging
the
conventional
greetings
with
all
in
the
group
nor
did
there
seem
to
be
any
thing
extraordinary
about
him
except
his
mourning
garments
in
the
center
of
that
brilliantly
lighted
room
yet
in
spite
of
them
his
remarkable
stature
his
features
and
his
movements
breathed
forth
an
air
of
healthy
youthfulness
in
which
both
body
and
mind
had
equally
developed
there
might
have
been
noticed
in
his
frank
pleasant
face
some
faint
traces
of
spanish
blood
showing
through
a
beautiful
brown
color
slightly
flushed
at
the
cheeks
as
a
result
perhaps
of
his
residence
in
cold
countries
what
he
exclaimed
with
joyful
surprise
the
curate
of
my
native
town
padre
damaso
my
father
intimate
friend
every
look
in
the
room
was
directed
toward
the
franciscan
who
made
no
movement
pardon
me
perhaps
i
mistaken
added
ibarra
embarrassed
you
are
not
mistaken
the
friar
was
at
last
able
to
articulate
in
a
changed
voice
but
your
father
was
never
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
ibarra
slowly
withdrew
his
extended
hand
looking
greatly
surprised
and
turned
to
encounter
the
gloomy
gaze
of
the
lieutenant
fixed
on
him
young
man
are
you
the
son
of
don
rafael
ibarra
he
asked
the
youth
bowed
fray
damaso
partly
rose
in
his
chair
and
stared
fixedly
at
the
lieutenant
welcome
back
to
your
country
and
may
you
be
happier
in
it
than
your
father
was
exclaimed
the
officer
in
a
trembling
voice
i
knew
him
well
and
can
say
that
he
was
one
of
the
worthiest
and
most
honorable
men
in
the
philippines
sir
replied
ibarra
deeply
moved
the
praise
you
bestow
upon
my
father
removes
my
doubts
about
the
manner
of
his
death
of
which
i
his
son
am
yet
ignorant
the
eyes
of
the
old
soldier
filled
with
tears
and
turning
away
hastily
he
withdrew
the
young
man
thus
found
himself
alone
in
the
center
of
the
room
his
host
having
disappeared
he
saw
no
one
who
might
introduce
him
to
the
young
ladies
many
of
whom
were
watching
him
with
interest
after
a
few
moments
of
hesitation
he
started
toward
them
in
a
simple
and
natural
manner
allow
me
he
said
to
overstep
the
rules
of
strict
etiquette
it
has
been
seven
years
since
i
have
been
in
my
own
country
and
upon
returning
to
it
i
can
not
suppress
my
admiration
and
refrain
from
paying
my
respects
to
its
most
precious
ornaments
the
ladies
but
as
none
of
them
ventured
a
reply
he
found
himself
obliged
to
retire
he
then
turned
toward
a
group
of
men
who
upon
seeing
him
approach
arranged
themselves
in
a
semicircle
gentlemen
he
addressed
them
it
is
a
custom
in
germany
when
a
stranger
finds
himself
at
a
function
and
there
is
no
one
to
introduce
him
to
those
present
that
he
give
his
name
and
so
introduce
himself
allow
me
to
adopt
this
usage
here
not
to
introduce
foreign
customs
when
our
own
are
so
beautiful
but
because
i
find
myself
driven
to
it
by
necessity
i
have
already
paid
my
respects
to
the
skies
and
to
the
ladies
of
my
native
land
now
i
wish
to
greet
its
citizens
my
gentlemen
my
name
is
juan
crisostomo
ibarra
y
magsalin
the
others
gave
their
names
more
or
less
obscure
and
unimportant
here
my
name
is
a
said
one
youth
dryly
as
he
made
a
slight
bow
then
i
have
the
honor
of
addressing
the
poet
whose
works
have
done
so
much
to
keep
up
my
enthusiasm
for
my
native
land
it
is
said
that
you
do
not
write
any
more
but
i
could
not
learn
the
reason
the
reason
because
one
does
not
seek
inspiration
in
order
to
debase
himself
and
lie
one
writer
has
been
imprisoned
for
having
put
a
very
obvious
truth
into
verse
they
may
have
called
me
a
poet
but
they
call
me
a
fool
and
may
i
enquire
what
that
truth
was
he
said
that
the
lion
son
is
also
a
lion
he
came
very
near
to
being
exiled
for
it
replied
the
strange
youth
moving
away
from
the
group
a
man
with
a
smiling
face
dressed
in
the
fashion
of
the
natives
of
the
country
with
diamond
studs
in
his
came
up
at
that
moment
almost
running
he
went
directly
to
ibarra
and
grasped
his
hand
saying
señor
ibarra
i
been
eager
to
make
your
acquaintance
capitan
tiago
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
knew
your
respected
father
i
am
known
as
capitan
tinong
and
live
in
tondo
where
you
will
always
be
welcome
i
hope
that
you
will
honor
me
with
a
visit
come
and
dine
with
us
tomorrow
he
smiled
and
rubbed
his
hands
thank
you
replied
ibarra
warmly
charmed
with
such
amiability
but
tomorrow
morning
i
must
leave
for
san
diego
how
unfortunate
then
it
will
be
on
your
return
dinner
is
served
announced
a
waiter
from
the
café
la
campana
and
the
guests
began
to
file
out
toward
the
table
the
women
especially
the
filipinas
with
great
hesitation

the
dinner

bago
quiere
fray
sibyla
seemed
to
be
very
content
as
he
moved
along
tranquilly
with
the
look
of
disdain
no
longer
playing
about
his
thin
refined
lips
he
even
condescended
to
speak
to
the
lame
doctor
de
espadaña
who
answered
in
monosyllables
only
as
he
was
somewhat
of
a
stutterer
the
franciscan
was
in
a
frightful
humor
kicking
at
the
chairs
and
even
elbowing
a
cadet
out
of
his
way
the
lieutenant
was
grave
while
the
others
talked
vivaciously
praising
the
magnificence
of
the
table
doña
victorina
however
was
just
turning
up
her
nose
in
disdain
when
she
suddenly
became
as
furious
as
a
trampled
serpent
the
lieutenant
had
stepped
on
the
train
of
her
gown
have
you
any
eyes
she
demanded
yes
señora
two
better
than
yours
but
the
fact
is
that
i
was
admiring
your
frizzes
retorted
the
rather
ungallant
soldier
as
he
moved
away
from
her
as
if
from
instinct
the
two
friars
both
started
toward
the
head
of
the
table
perhaps
from
habit
and
then
as
might
have
been
expected
the
same
thing
happened
that
occurs
with
the
competitors
for
a
university
position
who
openly
exalt
the
qualifications
and
superiority
of
their
opponents
later
giving
to
understand
that
just
the
contrary
was
meant
and
who
murmur
and
grumble
when
they
do
not
receive
the
appointment
for
you
fray
damaso
for
you
fray
sibyla
an
older
friend
of
the
family
confessor
of
the
deceased
lady
age
dignity
and
authority
not
so
very
old
either
on
the
other
hand
you
are
the
curate
of
the
district
replied
fray
damaso
sourly
without
taking
his
hand
from
the
back
of
the
chair
since
you
command
it
i
obey
concluded
fray
sibyla
disposing
himself
to
take
the
seat
i
do
command
it
protested
the
franciscan
i
do
command
it
fray
sibyla
was
about
to
seat
himself
without
paying
any
more
attention
to
these
protests
when
his
eyes
happened
to
encounter
those
of
the
lieutenant
according
to
clerical
opinion
in
the
philippines
the
highest
secular
official
is
inferior
to
a
arma
said
cicero
in
the
senate
arma
say
the
friars
in
the
philippines
but
fray
sibyla
was
a
person
so
he
said
lieutenant
here
we
are
in
the
world
and
not
in
the
church
the
seat
of
honor
belongs
to
you
to
judge
from
the
tone
of
his
voice
however
even
in
the
world
it
really
did
belong
to
him
and
the
lieutenant
either
to
keep
out
of
trouble
or
to
avoid
sitting
between
two
friars
curtly
declined
none
of
the
claimants
had
given
a
thought
to
their
host
ibarra
noticed
him
watching
the
scene
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
how
this
don
santiago
are
you
going
to
sit
down
with
us
but
all
the
seats
were
occupied
lucullus
was
not
to
sup
in
the
house
of
lucullus
sit
still
do
get
up
said
capitan
tiago
placing
his
hand
on
the
young
man
shoulder
this
fiesta
is
for
the
special
purpose
of
giving
thanks
to
the
virgin
for
your
safe
arrival
bring
on
the
i
ordered
as
you
doubtless
have
not
tasted
any
for
so
long
a
time
a
large
steaming
tureen
was
brought
in
the
dominican
after
muttering
the
benedicite
to
which
scarcely
any
one
knew
how
to
respond
began
to
serve
the
contents
but
whether
from
carelessness
or
other
cause
padre
damaso
received
a
plate
in
which
a
bare
neck
and
a
tough
wing
of
chicken
floated
about
in
a
large
quantity
of
soup
amid
lumps
of
squash
while
the
others
were
eating
legs
and
breasts
especially
ibarra
to
whose
lot
fell
the
second
joints
observing
all
this
the
franciscan
mashed
up
some
pieces
of
squash
barely
tasted
the
soup
dropped
his
spoon
noisily
and
roughly
pushed
his
plate
away
the
dominican
was
very
busy
talking
to
the
rubicund
youth
how
long
have
you
been
away
from
the
country
laruja
asked
ibarra
almost
seven
years
then
you
have
probably
forgotten
all
about
it
quite
the
contrary
even
if
my
country
does
seem
to
have
forgotten
me
i
have
always
thought
about
it
how
do
you
mean
that
it
has
forgotten
you
inquired
the
rubicund
youth
i
mean
that
it
has
been
a
year
since
i
have
received
any
news
from
here
so
that
i
find
myself
a
stranger
who
does
not
yet
know
how
and
when
his
father
died
this
statement
drew
a
sudden
exclamation
from
the
lieutenant
and
where
were
you
that
you
did
telegraph
asked
doña
victorina
when
we
were
married
we
telegraphed
to
the
peñinsula
señora
for
the
past
two
years
i
have
been
in
the
northern
part
of
europe
in
germany
and
russian
poland
doctor
de
espadaña
who
until
now
had
not
ventured
upon
any
conversation
thought
this
a
good
opportunity
to
say
something
i
i
knew
in
a
from
if
i
you
him
he
asked
timidly
and
almost
blushingly
it
very
likely
answered
ibarra
in
a
friendly
manner
but
just
at
this
moment
i
do
recall
him
you
have
him
with
any
one
else
went
on
the
doctor
taking
courage
he
was
as
gold
and
spanish
very
those
are
good
clues
but
unfortunately
while
there
i
talked
spanish
only
in
a
few
consulates
how
then
did
you
get
along
asked
the
wondering
doña
victorina
the
language
of
the
country
served
my
needs
madam
do
you
also
speak
english
inquired
the
dominican
who
had
been
in
hongkong
and
who
was
a
master
of
that
adulteration
of
shakespeare
tongue
used
by
the
sons
of
the
celestial
empire
i
stayed
in
england
a
year
among
people
who
talked
nothing
but
english
which
country
of
europe
pleased
you
the
most
asked
the
rubicund
youth
after
spain
my
second
fatherland
any
country
of
free
europe
and
you
who
seem
to
have
traveled
so
much
tell
us
what
do
you
consider
the
most
notable
thing
that
you
have
seen
inquired
laruja
ibarra
appeared
to
reflect
notable
in
what
way
for
example
in
regard
to
the
life
of
the
people
the
social
political
religious
life
in
general
in
its
essential
features
as
a
whole
ibarra
paused
thoughtfully
before
replying
frankly
i
like
everything
in
those
people
setting
aside
the
national
pride
of
each
one
but
before
visiting
a
country
i
tried
to
familiarize
myself
with
its
history
its
exodus
if
i
may
so
speak
and
afterwards
i
found
everything
quite
natural
i
have
observed
that
the
prosperity
or
misery
of
each
people
is
in
direct
proportion
to
its
liberties
or
its
prejudices
and
accordingly
to
the
sacrifices
or
the
selfishness
of
its
forefathers
and
have
you
observed
anything
more
than
that
broke
in
the
franciscan
with
a
sneer
since
the
beginning
of
the
dinner
he
had
not
uttered
a
single
word
his
whole
attention
having
been
taking
up
no
doubt
with
the
food
it
was
worth
while
to
squander
your
fortune
to
learn
so
trifling
a
thing
any
schoolboy
knows
that
ibarra
was
placed
in
an
embarrassing
position
and
the
rest
looked
from
one
to
the
other
as
if
fearing
a
disagreeable
scene
he
was
about
to
say
the
dinner
is
nearly
over
and
his
reverence
is
now
satiated
but
restrained
himself
and
merely
remarked
to
the
others
gentlemen
do
be
surprised
at
the
familiarity
with
which
our
former
curate
treats
me
he
treated
me
so
when
i
was
a
child
and
the
years
seem
to
make
no
difference
in
his
reverence
i
appreciate
it
too
because
it
recalls
the
days
when
his
reverence
visited
our
home
and
honored
my
father
table
the
dominican
glanced
furtively
at
the
franciscan
who
was
trembling
visibly
ibarra
continued
as
he
rose
from
the
table
you
will
now
permit
me
to
retire
since
as
i
have
just
arrived
and
must
go
away
tomorrow
morning
there
remain
some
important
business
matters
for
me
to
attend
to
the
principal
part
of
the
dinner
is
over
and
i
drink
but
little
wine
and
seldom
touch
cordials
gentlemen
all
for
spain
and
the
philippines
saying
this
he
drained
his
glass
which
he
had
not
before
touched
the
old
lieutenant
silently
followed
his
example
do
go
whispered
capitan
tiago
maria
clara
will
be
here
isabel
has
gone
to
get
her
the
new
curate
of
your
town
who
is
a
saint
is
also
coming
i
call
tomorrow
before
starting
i
a
very
important
visit
to
make
now
with
this
he
went
away
meanwhile
the
franciscan
had
recovered
himself
do
you
see
he
said
to
the
rubicund
youth
at
the
same
time
flourishing
his
dessert
spoon
that
comes
from
pride
they
ca
stand
to
have
the
curate
correct
them
they
even
think
that
they
are
respectable
persons
the
evil
result
of
sending
young
men
to
europe
the
government
ought
to
prohibit
it
and
how
about
the
lieutenant
doña
victorina
chimed
in
upon
the
franciscan
he
did
get
the
frown
off
his
face
the
whole
evening
he
did
well
to
leave
us
so
old
and
still
only
a
lieutenant
the
lady
could
not
forget
the
allusion
to
her
frizzes
and
the
trampled
ruffles
of
her
gown
that
night
the
rubicund
youth
wrote
down
among
other
things
the
following
title
for
a
chapter
in
his
concerning
the
manner
in
which
the
neck
and
wing
of
a
chicken
in
a
friar
plate
of
soup
may
disturb
the
merriment
of
a
feast
among
his
notes
there
appeared
these
observations
in
the
philippines
the
most
unnecessary
person
at
a
dinner
is
he
who
gives
it
for
they
are
quite
capable
of
beginning
by
throwing
the
host
into
the
street
and
then
everything
will
go
on
smoothly
under
present
conditions
it
would
perhaps
be
a
good
thing
not
to
allow
the
filipinos
to
leave
the
country
and
even
not
to
teach
them
to
read
chapter
iv
heretic
and
filibuster
ibarra
stood
undecided
for
a
moment
the
night
breeze
which
during
those
months
blows
cool
enough
in
manila
seemed
to
drive
from
his
forehead
the
light
cloud
that
had
darkened
it
he
took
off
his
hat
and
drew
a
deep
breath
carriages
flashed
by
public
rigs
moved
along
at
a
sleepy
pace
pedestrians
of
many
nationalities
were
passing
he
walked
along
at
that
irregular
pace
which
indicates
thoughtful
abstraction
or
freedom
from
care
directing
his
steps
toward
binondo
plaza
and
looking
about
him
as
if
to
recall
the
place
there
were
the
same
streets
and
the
identical
houses
with
their
white
and
blue
walls
whitewashed
or
frescoed
in
bad
imitation
of
granite
the
church
continued
to
show
its
illuminated
clock
face
there
were
the
same
chinese
shops
with
their
soiled
curtains
and
their
iron
gratings
in
one
of
which
was
a
bar
that
he
in
imitation
of
the
street
urchins
of
manila
had
twisted
one
night
it
was
still
unstraightened
how
slowly
everything
moves
he
murmured
as
he
turned
into
calle
sacristia
the
venders
were
repeating
the
same
shrill
cry
while
the
smoky
lamps
still
lighted
the
identical
chinese
stands
and
those
of
the
old
women
who
sold
candy
and
fruit
wonderful
he
exclaimed
there
the
same
chinese
who
was
here
seven
years
ago
and
that
old
woman
the
very
same
it
might
be
said
that
tonight
i
dreamed
of
a
seven
years
journey
in
europe
good
heavens
that
pavement
is
still
in
the
same
unrepaired
condition
as
when
i
left
true
it
was
that
the
stones
of
the
sidewalk
on
the
corner
of
san
jacinto
and
sacristia
were
still
loose
while
he
was
meditating
upon
this
marvel
of
the
city
stability
in
a
country
where
everything
is
so
unstable
a
hand
was
placed
lightly
on
his
shoulder
he
raised
his
head
to
see
the
old
lieutenant
gazing
at
him
with
something
like
a
smile
in
place
of
the
hard
expression
and
the
frown
which
usually
characterized
him
young
man
be
careful
learn
from
your
father
was
the
abrupt
greeting
of
the
old
soldier
pardon
me
but
you
seem
to
have
thought
a
great
deal
of
my
father
can
you
tell
me
how
he
died
asked
ibarra
staring
at
him
what
do
you
know
about
it
asked
the
officer
i
asked
don
santiago
about
it
but
he
would
promise
to
tell
me
until
tomorrow
perhaps
you
know
i
should
say
i
do
as
does
everybody
else
he
died
in
prison
the
young
man
stepped
backward
a
pace
and
gazed
searchingly
at
the
lieutenant
in
prison
who
died
in
prison
your
father
man
since
he
was
in
confinement
was
the
somewhat
surprised
answer
my
father
in
prison
confined
in
a
prison
what
are
you
talking
about
do
you
know
who
my
father
was
are
you
demanded
the
young
man
seizing
the
officer
arm
i
rather
think
that
i
not
mistaken
he
was
don
rafael
ibarra
yes
don
rafael
ibarra
echoed
the
youth
weakly
well
i
thought
you
knew
about
it
muttered
the
soldier
in
a
tone
of
compassion
as
he
saw
what
was
passing
in
ibarra
mind
i
supposed
that
you
but
be
brave
here
one
can
not
be
honest
and
keep
out
of
jail
i
must
believe
that
you
are
not
joking
with
me
replied
ibarra
in
a
weak
voice
after
a
few
moments
silence
can
you
tell
me
why
he
was
in
prison
the
old
man
seemed
to
be
perplexed
it
strange
to
me
that
your
family
affairs
were
not
made
known
to
you
his
last
letter
a
year
ago
said
that
i
should
not
be
uneasy
if
he
did
not
write
as
he
was
very
busy
he
charged
me
to
continue
my
studies
and
sent
me
his
blessing
then
he
wrote
that
letter
to
you
just
before
he
died
it
will
soon
be
a
year
since
we
buried
him
but
why
was
my
father
a
prisoner
for
a
very
honorable
reason
but
come
with
me
to
the
barracks
and
i
tell
you
as
we
go
along
take
my
arm
they
moved
along
for
some
time
in
silence
the
elder
seemed
to
be
in
deep
thought
and
to
be
seeking
inspiration
from
his
goatee
which
he
stroked
continually
as
you
well
know
he
began
your
father
was
the
richest
man
in
the
province
and
while
many
loved
and
respected
him
there
were
also
some
who
envied
and
hated
him
we
spaniards
who
come
to
the
philippines
are
unfortunately
not
all
we
ought
to
be
i
say
this
as
much
on
account
of
one
of
your
ancestors
as
on
account
of
your
enemies
the
continual
changes
the
corruption
in
the
higher
circles
the
favoritism
the
low
cost
and
the
shortness
of
the
journey
are
to
blame
for
it
all
the
worst
characters
of
the
peninsula
come
here
and
even
if
a
good
man
does
come
the
country
soon
ruins
him
so
it
was
that
your
father
had
a
number
of
enemies
among
the
curates
and
other
spaniards
here
he
hesitated
for
a
while
some
months
after
your
departure
the
troubles
with
padre
damaso
began
but
i
am
unable
to
explain
the
real
cause
of
them
fray
damaso
accused
him
of
not
coming
to
confession
although
he
had
not
done
so
formerly
and
they
had
nevertheless
been
good
friends
as
you
may
still
remember
moreover
don
rafael
was
a
very
upright
man
more
so
than
many
of
those
who
regularly
attend
confession
and
than
the
confessors
themselves
he
had
framed
for
himself
a
rigid
morality
and
often
said
to
me
when
he
talked
of
these
troubles
guevara
do
you
believe
that
god
will
pardon
any
crime
a
murder
for
instance
solely
by
a
man
telling
it
to
a
priest
a
man
after
all
and
one
whose
duty
it
is
to
keep
quiet
about
it
by
his
fearing
that
he
will
roast
in
hell
as
a
penance
by
being
cowardly
and
certainly
shameless
into
the
bargain
i
have
another
conception
of
god
he
used
to
say
in
my
opinion
one
evil
does
not
correct
another
nor
is
a
crime
to
be
expiated
by
vain
lamentings
or
by
giving
alms
to
the
church
take
this
example
if
i
have
killed
the
father
of
a
family
if
i
have
made
of
a
woman
a
sorrowing
widow
and
destitute
orphans
of
some
happy
children
have
i
satisfied
eternal
justice
by
letting
myself
be
hanged
or
by
entrusting
my
secret
to
one
who
is
obliged
to
guard
it
for
me
or
by
giving
alms
to
priests
who
are
least
in
need
of
them
or
by
buying
indulgences
and
lamenting
night
and
day
what
of
the
widow
and
the
orphans
my
conscience
tells
me
that
i
should
try
to
take
the
place
of
him
whom
i
killed
that
i
should
dedicate
my
whole
life
to
the
welfare
of
the
family
whose
misfortunes
i
caused
but
even
so
who
can
replace
the
love
of
a
husband
and
a
father
thus
your
father
reasoned
and
by
this
strict
standard
of
conduct
regulated
all
his
actions
so
that
it
can
be
said
that
he
never
injured
anybody
on
the
contrary
he
endeavored
by
his
good
deeds
to
wipe
out
some
injustices
which
he
said
your
ancestors
had
committed
but
to
get
back
to
his
troubles
with
the
curate
these
took
on
a
serious
aspect
padre
damaso
denounced
him
from
the
pulpit
and
that
he
did
not
expressly
name
him
was
a
miracle
since
anything
might
have
been
expected
of
such
a
character
i
foresaw
that
sooner
or
later
the
affair
would
have
serious
results
again
the
old
lieutenant
paused
there
happened
to
be
wandering
about
the
province
an
who
has
been
discharged
from
the
army
on
account
of
his
stupidity
and
ignorance
as
the
man
had
to
live
and
he
was
not
permitted
to
engage
in
manual
labor
which
would
injure
our
prestige
he
somehow
or
other
obtained
a
position
as
collector
of
the
tax
on
vehicles
the
poor
devil
had
no
education
at
all
a
fact
of
which
the
natives
soon
became
aware
as
it
was
a
marvel
for
them
to
see
a
spaniard
who
did
know
how
to
read
and
write
every
one
ridiculed
him
and
the
payment
of
the
tax
was
the
occasion
of
broad
smiles
he
knew
that
he
was
an
object
of
ridicule
and
this
tended
to
sour
his
disposition
even
more
rough
and
bad
as
it
had
formerly
been
they
would
purposely
hand
him
the
papers
upside
down
to
see
his
efforts
to
read
them
and
wherever
he
found
a
blank
space
he
would
scribble
a
lot
of
pothooks
which
rather
fitly
passed
for
his
signature
the
natives
mocked
while
they
paid
him
he
swallowed
his
pride
and
made
the
collections
but
was
in
such
a
state
of
mind
that
he
had
no
respect
for
any
one
he
even
came
to
have
some
hard
words
with
your
father
one
day
it
happened
that
he
was
in
a
shop
turning
a
document
over
and
over
in
the
effort
to
get
it
straight
when
a
schoolboy
began
to
make
signs
to
his
companions
and
to
point
laughingly
at
the
collector
with
his
finger
the
fellow
heard
the
laughter
and
saw
the
joke
reflected
in
the
solemn
faces
of
the
bystanders
he
lost
his
patience
and
turning
quickly
started
to
chase
the
boys
who
ran
away
shouting
be
bi
bo
blind
with
rage
and
unable
to
catch
them
he
threw
his
cane
and
struck
one
of
the
boys
on
the
head
knocking
him
down
he
ran
up
and
began
to
kick
the
fallen
boy
and
none
of
those
who
had
been
laughing
had
the
courage
to
interfere
unfortunately
your
father
happened
to
come
along
just
at
that
time
he
ran
forward
indignantly
caught
the
collector
by
the
arm
and
reprimanded
him
severely
the
artilleryman
who
was
no
doubt
beside
himself
with
rage
raised
his
hand
but
your
father
was
too
quick
for
him
and
with
the
strength
of
a
descendant
of
the
basques
some
say
that
he
struck
him
others
that
he
merely
pushed
him
but
at
any
rate
the
man
staggered
and
fell
a
little
way
off
striking
his
head
against
a
stone
don
rafael
quietly
picked
the
wounded
boy
up
and
carried
him
to
the
town
hall
the
artilleryman
bled
freely
from
the
mouth
and
died
a
few
moments
later
without
recovering
consciousness
as
was
to
be
expected
the
authorities
intervened
and
arrested
your
father
all
his
hidden
enemies
at
once
rose
up
and
false
accusations
came
from
all
sides
he
was
accused
of
being
a
heretic
and
a
filibuster
to
be
a
heretic
is
a
great
danger
anywhere
but
especially
so
at
that
time
when
the
province
was
governed
by
an
alcalde
who
made
a
great
show
of
his
piety
who
with
his
servants
used
to
recite
his
rosary
in
the
church
in
a
loud
voice
perhaps
that
all
might
hear
and
pray
with
him
but
to
be
a
filibuster
is
worse
than
to
be
a
heretic
and
to
kill
three
or
four
who
know
how
to
read
write
and
attend
to
business
every
one
abandoned
him
and
his
books
and
papers
were
seized
he
was
accused
of
subscribing
to
correo
de
and
to
newspapers
from
madrid
of
having
sent
you
to
germany
of
having
in
his
possession
letters
and
a
photograph
of
a
priest
who
had
been
legally
executed
and
i
do
know
what
not
everything
served
as
an
accusation
even
the
fact
that
he
a
descendant
of
peninsulars
wore
a
camisa
had
it
been
any
one
but
your
father
it
is
likely
that
he
would
soon
have
been
set
free
as
there
was
a
physician
who
ascribed
the
death
of
the
unfortunate
collector
to
a
hemorrhage
but
his
wealth
his
confidence
in
the
law
and
his
hatred
of
everything
that
was
not
legal
and
just
wrought
his
undoing
in
spite
of
my
repugnance
to
asking
for
mercy
from
any
one
i
applied
personally
to
the
the
predecessor
of
our
present
one
and
urged
upon
him
that
there
could
not
be
anything
of
the
filibuster
about
a
man
who
took
up
with
all
the
spaniards
even
the
poor
emigrants
and
gave
them
food
and
shelter
and
in
whose
veins
yet
flowed
the
generous
blood
of
spain
it
was
in
vain
that
i
pledged
my
life
and
swore
by
my
poverty
and
my
military
honor
i
succeeded
only
in
being
coldly
listened
to
and
roughly
sent
away
with
the
epithet
of
the
old
man
paused
to
take
a
deep
breath
and
after
noticing
the
silence
of
his
companion
who
was
listening
with
averted
face
continued
at
your
father
request
i
prepared
the
defense
in
the
case
i
went
first
to
the
celebrated
filipino
lawyer
young
a
but
he
refused
to
take
the
case
should
lose
it
he
told
me
my
defending
him
would
furnish
the
motive
for
another
charge
against
him
and
perhaps
one
against
me
go
to
señor
m
who
is
a
forceful
and
fluent
speaker
and
a
peninsular
of
great
influence
i
did
so
and
the
noted
lawyer
took
charge
of
the
case
and
conducted
it
with
mastery
and
brilliance
but
your
father
enemies
were
numerous
some
of
them
hidden
and
unknown
false
witnesses
abounded
and
their
calumnies
which
under
other
circumstances
would
have
melted
away
before
a
sarcastic
phrase
from
the
defense
here
assumed
shape
and
substance
if
the
lawyer
succeeded
in
destroying
the
force
of
their
testimony
by
making
them
contradict
each
other
and
even
perjure
themselves
new
charges
were
at
once
preferred
they
accused
him
of
having
illegally
taken
possession
of
a
great
deal
of
land
and
demanded
damages
they
said
that
he
maintained
relations
with
the
tulisanes
in
order
that
his
crops
and
animals
might
not
be
molested
by
them
at
last
the
case
became
so
confused
that
at
the
end
of
a
year
no
one
understood
it
the
alcalde
had
to
leave
and
there
came
in
his
place
one
who
had
the
reputation
of
being
honest
but
unfortunately
he
stayed
only
a
few
months
and
his
successor
was
too
fond
of
good
horses
the
sufferings
the
worries
the
hard
life
in
the
prison
or
the
pain
of
seeing
so
much
ingratitude
broke
your
father
iron
constitution
and
he
fell
ill
with
that
malady
which
only
the
tomb
can
cure
when
the
case
was
almost
finished
and
he
was
about
to
be
acquitted
of
the
charge
of
being
an
enemy
of
the
fatherland
and
of
being
the
murderer
of
the
he
died
in
the
prison
with
no
one

in

but
still
ibarra
said
nothing
they
had
arrived
meanwhile
at
the
door
of

the
soldier
stopped
and
said

he
grasped
the

young
man

details
ask
capitan
tiago
now
good
night
as
i
must
return
to
duty
and
see
that
all
well
silently
but
with
great
feeling
ibarra
shook
the
lieutenant
bony
hand
and
followed
him
with
his
eyes
until
he
disappeared
then
he
turned
slowly
and
signaled
to
a
passing
carriage
to

the

he
gave

voice

dark
night
ibarra
went
to
his
room
which
overlooked
the
river
and
dropping
into
a
chair
gazed
out
into
the
vast
expanse
of
the
heavens
spread
before
him
through
the
open
window
the
house
on
the
opposite
bank
was
profusely
lighted
and
gay
strains
of
music
largely
from
stringed
instruments
were
borne
across
the
river
even
to
his
room
if
the
young
man
had
been
less
preoccupied
if
he
had
had
more
curiosity
and
had
cared
to
see
with
his
opera
glasses
what
was
going
on
in
that
atmosphere
of
light
he
would
have
been
charmed
with
one
of
those
magical
and
fantastic
spectacles
the
like
of
which
is
sometimes
seen
in
the
great
theaters
of
europe
to
the
subdued
strains
of
the
orchestra
there
seems
to
appear
in
the
midst
of
a
shower
of
light
a
cascade
of
gold
and
diamonds
in
an
oriental
setting
a
deity
wrapped
in
misty
gauze
a
sylph
enveloped
in
a
luminous
halo
who
moves
forward
apparently
without
touching
the
floor
in
her
presence
the
flowers
bloom
the

the

bursts
forth
and
troops
of
devils
nymphs
satyrs
demons
angels
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
dance
shake
their
tambourines
and
whirl
about
in
rhythmic
evolutions
each

some
tribute
at
the
feet
of

ibarra
would
have
seen
a
beautiful
and
graceful
maiden
clothed
in
the
picturesque
garments
of
the
daughters
of

standing
in
the

gesticulating
and
moving

in

smiling
like

yes
fray
sibyla

was
talking
to
her
doña

was
arranging
in
the

of

a
string
of
pearls
and
diamonds
which
threw
out
all
the
beautiful
tints
of
the

she
was
white
perhaps
too
much
so
and
whenever
she
raised
her
downcast
eyes
there
shone
forth
a
spotless
soul
when
she
smiled
so
as
to
show
her
small
white
teeth
the
beholder
realized
that
the
rose
is
only
a
flower
and
ivory
but
the
elephant
tusk
from
out
the
filmy
piña
draperies
around
her
white
and
shapely
neck
there
blinked
as
the
tagalogs

the
bright
eyes
of
a
collar
of
diamonds
one
man
only
in
all
the
crowd
seemed
insensible
to
her
radiant
influence
a
young
franciscan
thin
wasted
and
pale
who
watched
her
from
a
distance
motionless
as
a
statue
and
scarcely
breathing
but
ibarra
saw
nothing
of
all
this
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
other
things
a
small
space
was
enclosed
by
four
bare
and
grimy
walls
in
one
of
which
was
an
iron
grating
on
the
filthy
and
loathsome
floor
was
a
mat
upon
which
an
old
man
lay
alone
in
the
throes
of
death
an
old
man
breathing
with
difficulty
and
turning
his
head
from
side
to
side
as
amid
his
tears
he
uttered
a
name
the
old
man
was
alone
but
from
time
to
time
a
groan
or
the
rattle
of
a
chain
was
heard
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
far
away
there
was
a
merry
feast
almost
an
orgy
a
youth
was
laughing
shouting
and
pouring
wine
upon
the
flowers
amid
the
applause
and
drunken
laughter
of
his
companions
the
old
man
had
the
features
of
father
the
youth
was
himself
and
the
name
that
the
old
man
uttered
with
tears
was
name
this
was
what
the
wretched
young
man
saw
before
him
the
lights
in
the
house
opposite
were
extinguished
the
music
and
the
noises
ceased
but
ibarra
still
heard
the
anguished
cry
of
his
father
calling
upon
his
son
in
the
hour
of
his
death
silence
had
now
blown
its
hollow
breath
over
the
city
and
all
things
seemed
to
sleep
in
the
embrace
of
nothingness
the
alternated
with
the
strokes
of
the
clocks
in
the
church
towers
and
the
mournful
cries
of
the
weary
sentinels
a
waning
moon
began
to
appear
and
everything
seemed
to
be
at
rest
even
ibarra
himself
worn
out
by
his
sad
thoughts
or
by
his
journey
now
slept
only
the
young
franciscan
whom
we
saw
not
so
long
ago
standing
motionless
and
silent
in
the
midst
of
the
gaiety
of
the
ballroom
slept
not
but
kept
vigil
in
his
cell
with
his
elbow
upon
the
window
sill
and
his
pale
worn
cheek
resting
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
was
gazing
silently
into
the
distance
where
a
bright
star
glittered
in
the
dark
sky
the
star
paled
and
disappeared
the
dim
light
of
the
waning
moon
faded
but
the
friar
did
not
move
from
his
place
he
was
gazing
out
over
the
field
of
bagumbayan
and
the
sleeping
sea
at
the
far
horizon
wrapped
in
the
morning
mist

capitan
tiago
thy
will
be
done
on
earth
while
our
characters
are
deep
in
slumber
or
busy
with
their
breakfasts
let
us
turn
our
attention
to
capitan
tiago
we
have
never
had
the
honor
of
being
his
guest
so
it
is
neither
our
right
nor
our
duty
to
pass
him
by
slightingly
even
under
the
stress
of
important
events
low
in
stature
with
a
clear
complexion
a
corpulent
figure
and
a
full
face
thanks
to
the
liberal
supply
of
fat
which
according
to
his
admirers
was
the
gift
of
heaven
and
which
his
enemies
averred
was
the
blood
of
the
poor
capitan
tiago
appeared
to
be
younger
than
he
really
was
he
might
have
been
thought
between
thirty
and
years
of
age
at
the
time
of
our
story
his
countenance
always
wore
a
sanctified
look
his
little
round
head
covered
with
hair
cut
long
in
front
and
short
behind
was
reputed
to
contain
many
things
of
weight
his
eyes
small
but
with
no
chinese
slant
never
varied
in
expression
his
nose
was
slender
and
not
at
all
inclined
to
flatness
and
if
his
mouth
had
not
been
disfigured
by
the
immoderate
use
of
tobacco
and
buyo
which
when
chewed
and
gathered
in
one
cheek
marred
the
symmetry
of
his
features
we
would
say
that
he
might
properly
have
considered
himself
a
handsome
man
and
have
passed
for
such
yet
in
spite
of
this
bad
habit
he
kept
marvelously
white
both
his
natural
teeth
and
also
the
two
which
the
dentist
furnished
him
at
twelve
pesos
each
he
was
considered
one
of
the
richest
landlords
in
binondo
and
a
planter
of
some
importance
by
reason
of
his
estates
in
pampanga
and
laguna
principally
in
the
town
of
san
diego
the
income
from
which
increased
with
each
year
san
diego
on
account
of
its
agreeable
baths
its
famous
cockpit
and
his
cherished
memories
of
the
place
was
his
favorite
town
so
that
he
spent
at
least
two
months
of
the
year
there
his
holdings
of
real
estate
in
the
city
were
large
and
it
is
superfluous
to
state
that
the
opium
monopoly
controlled
by
him
and
a
chinese
brought
in
large
profits
they
also
had
the
lucrative
contract
of
feeding
the
prisoners
in
bilibid
and
furnished
zacate
to
many
of
the
stateliest
establishments
in
manila
u
through
the
medium
of
contracts
of
course
standing
well
with
all
the
authorities
clever
cunning
and
even
bold
in
speculating
upon
the
wants
of
others
he
was
the
only
formidable
rival
of
a
certain
perez
in
the
matter
of
the
of
revenues
and
the
sale
of
offices
and
appointments
which
the
philippine
government
always
confides
to
private
persons
thus
at
the
time
of
the
events
here
narrated
capitan
tiago
was
a
happy
man
in
so
far
as
it
is
possible
for
a
individual
to
be
happy
in
such
a
land
he
was
rich
and
at
peace
with
god
the
government
and
men
that
he
was
at
peace
with
god
was
beyond
doubt
almost
like
religion
itself
there
is
no
need
to
be
on
bad
terms
with
the
good
god
when
one
is
prosperous
on
earth
when
one
has
never
had
any
direct
dealings
with
him
and
has
never
lent
him
any
money
capitan
tiago
himself
had
never
offered
any
prayers
to
him
even
in
his
greatest
difficulties
for
he
was
rich
and
his
gold
prayed
for
him
for
masses
and
supplications
high
and
powerful
priests
had
been
created
for
novenas
and
rosaries
god
in
his
infinite
bounty
had
created
the
poor
for
the
service
of
the
rich
the
poor
who
for
a
peso
could
be
secured
to
recite
sixteen
mysteries
and
to
read
all
the
sacred
books
even
the
hebrew
bible
for
a
little
extra
if
at
any
time
in
the
midst
of
pressing
difficulties
he
needed
celestial
aid
and
had
not
at
hand
even
a
red
chinese
taper
he
would
call
upon
his
most
adored
saints
promising
them
many
things
for
the
purpose
of
putting
them
under
obligation
to
him
and
ultimately
convincing
them
of
the
righteousness
of
his
desires
the
saint
to
whom
he
promised
the
most
and
whose
promises
he
was
the
most
faithful
in
fulfilling
was
the
virgin
of
antipolo
our
lady
of
peace
and
prosperous
voyages
with
many
of
the
lesser
saints
he
was
not
very
punctual
or
even
decent
and
sometimes
after
having
his
petitions
granted
he
thought
no
more
about
them
though
of
course
after
such
treatment
he
did
not
bother
them
again
when
occasion
arose
capitan
tiago
knew
that
the
calendar
was
full
of
idle
saints
who
perhaps
had
nothing
wherewith
to
occupy
their
time
up
there
in
heaven
furthermore
to
the
virgin
of
antipolo
he
ascribed
greater
power
and
efficiency
than
to
all
the
other
virgins
combined
whether
they
carried
silver
canes
naked
or
richly
clothed
images
of
the
christ
child
scapularies
rosaries
or
girdles
perhaps
this
reverence
was
owing
to
the
fact
that
she
was
a
very
strict
lady
watchful
of
her
name
and
according
to
the
senior
sacristan
of
antipolo
an
enemy
of
photography
when
she
was
angered
she
turned
black
as
ebony
while
the
other
virgins
were
softer
of
heart
and
more
indulgent
it
is
a
fact
that
some
minds
love
an
absolute
monarch
rather
than
a
constitutional
one
as
witness
louis
xiv
and
louis
xvi
philip
ii
and
amadeo
i
this
fact
perhaps
explains
why
infidel
chinese
and
even
spaniards
may
be
seen
kneeling
in
the
famous
sanctuary
what
is
not
explained
is
why
the
priests
run
away
with
the
money
of
the
terrible
image
go
to
america
and
get
married
there
in
the
sala
of
capitan
tiago
house
that
door
hidden
by
a
silk
curtain
leads
to
a
small
chapel
or
oratory
such
as
must
be
lacking
in
no
filipino
home
there
were
placed
his
household
gods
and
we
say
gods
because
he
was
inclined
to
polytheism
rather
than
to
monotheism
which
he
had
never
come
to
understand
there
could
be
seen
images
of
the
holy
family
with
busts
and
extremities
of
ivory
glass
eyes
long
eyelashes
and
curly
blond
hair
masterpieces
of
santa
cruz
sculpture
paintings
in
oil
by
artists
of
paco
and
ermita
represented
martyrdoms
of
saints
and
miracles
of
the
virgin
lucy
gazing
at
the
sky
and
carrying
in
a
plate
an
extra
pair
of
eyes
with
lashes
and
eyebrows
such
as
are
seen
painted
in
the
triangle
of
the
trinity
or
on
egyptian
tombs
pascual
bailon
anthony
of
padua
in
a
habit
looking
with
tears
upon
a
christ
child
dressed
as
a
with
the
hat
sword
and
boots
as
in
the
children
ball
at
madrid
that
character
is
represented
which
signified
for
capitan
tiago
that
while
god
might
include
in
his
omnipotence
the
power
of
a
of
the
philippines
the
franciscans
would
nevertheless
play
with
him
as
with
a
doll
there
might
also
be
seen
a
anthony
the
abbot
with
a
hog
by
his
side
a
hog
that
for
the
worthy
capitan
was
as
miraculous
as
the
saint
himself
for
which
reason
he
never
dared
to
refer
to
it
as
the
but
as
the
of
holy
a
francis
of
assisi
in
a
robe
and
with
seven
wings
placed
over
a
vincent
who
had
only
two
but
in
compensation
carried
a
trumpet
a
peter
the
martyr
with
his
head
split
open
by
the
talibon
of
an
and
held
fast
by
a
kneeling
infidel
side
by
side
with
another
peter
cutting
off
the
ear
of
a
moro
malchus
no
doubt
who
was
gnawing
his
lips
and
writhing
with
pain
while
a
on
a
doric
column
crowed
and
flapped
his
wings
from
all
of
which
capitan
tiago
deduced
that
in
order
to
be
a
saint
it
was
just
as
well
to
smite
as
to
be
smitten
who
could
enumerate
that
army
of
images
and
recount
the
virtues
and
perfections
that
were
treasured
there
a
whole
chapter
would
hardly
suffice
yet
we
must
not
pass
over
in
silence
a
beautiful
michael
of
painted
and
gilded
wood
almost
four
feet
high
the
archangel
is
biting
his
lower
lip
and
with
flashing
eyes
frowning
forehead
and
rosy
cheeks
is
grasping
a
greek
shield
and
brandishing
in
his
right
hand
a
sulu
kris
ready
as
would
appear
from
his
attitude
and
expression
to
smite
a
worshiper
or
any
one
else
who
might
approach
rather
than
the
horned
and
tailed
devil
that
had
his
teeth
set
in
his
girlish
leg
capitan
tiago
never
went
near
this
image
from
fear
of
a
miracle
had
not
other
images
even
those
more
rudely
carved
ones
that
issue
from
the
carpenter
shops
of
paete
many
times
come
to
life
for
the
confusion
and
punishment
of
incredulous
sinners
it
is
a
fact
that
a
certain
image
of
christ
in
spain
when
invoked
as
a
witness
of
promises
of
love
had
assented
with
a
movement
of
the
head
in
the
presence
of
the
judge
and
that
another
such
image
had
reached
out
its
right
arm
to
embrace
lutgarda
and
furthermore
had
he
not
himself
read
a
booklet
recently
published
about
a
mimic
sermon
preached
by
an
image
of
dominic
in
soriano
true
the
saint
had
not
said
a
single
word
but
from
his
movements
it
was
inferred
at
any
rate
the
author
of
the
booklet
inferred
that
he
was
announcing
the
end
of
the
world
was
it
not
reported
too
that
the
virgin
of
luta
in
the
town
of
lipa
had
one
cheek
swollen
larger
than
the
other
and
that
there
was
mud
on
the
borders
of
her
gown
does
not
this
prove
mathematically
that
the
holy
images
also
walk
about
without
holding
up
their
skirts
and
that
they
even
suffer
from
the
toothache
perhaps
for
our
sake
had
he
not
seen
with
his
own
eyes
during
the
regular
sermon
all
the
images
of
christ
move
and
bow
their
heads
thrice
in
unison
thereby
calling
forth
wails
and
cries
from
the
women
and
other
sensitive
souls
destined
for
heaven
more
we
ourselves
have
seen
the
preacher
show
to
the
congregation
at
the
moment
of
the
descent
from
the
cross
a
handkerchief
stained
with
blood
and
were
ourselves
on
the
point
of
weeping
piously
when
to
the
sorrow
of
our
soul
a
sacristan
assured
us
that
it
was
all
a
joke
that
the
blood
was
that
of
a
chicken
which
had
been
roasted
and
eaten
on
the
spot
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
good
friday
and
the
sacristan
was
fat
so
capitan
tiago
even
though
he
was
a
prudent
and
pious
individual
took
care
not
to
approach
the
kris
of
michael
let
take
no
chances
he
would
say
to
himself
i
know
that
he
an
archangel
but
i
do
trust
him
no
i
do
trust
him
not
a
year
passed
without
his
joining
with
an
orchestra
in
the
pilgrimage
to
the
wealthy
shrine
of
antipolo
he
paid
for
two
thanksgiving
masses
of
the
many
that
make
up
the
three
novenas
and
also
for
the
days
when
there
are
no
novenas
and
washed
himself
afterwards
in
the
famous
or
pool
where
the
sacred
image
herself
had
bathed
her
votaries
can
even
yet
discern
the
tracks
of
her
feet
and
the
traces
of
her
locks
in
the
hard
rock
where
she
dried
them
resembling
exactly
those
made
by
any
woman
who
uses
and
just
as
if
her
hair
had
been
steel
or
diamonds
and
she
had
weighed
a
thousand
tons
we
should
like
to
see
the
terrible
image
once
shake
her
sacred
hair
in
the
eyes
of
those
credulous
persons
and
put
her
foot
upon
their
tongues
or
their
heads
there
at
the
very
edge
of
the
pool
capitan
tiago
made
it
his
duty
to
eat
roast
pig
of
with
leaves
and
other
more
or
less
appetizing
dishes
the
two
masses
would
cost
him
over
four
hundred
pesos
but
it
was
cheap
after
all
if
one
considered
the
glory
that
the
mother
of
the
lord
would
acquire
from
the
rockets
bombs
and
mortars
and
also
the
increased
profits
which
thanks
to
these
masses
would
come
to
one
during
the
year
but
antipolo
was
not
the
only
theater
of
his
ostentatious
devotion
in
binondo
in
pampanga
and
in
the
town
of
san
diego
when
he
was
about
to
put
up
a
with
large
wagers
he
would
send
gold
moneys
to
the
curate
for
propitiatory
masses
and
just
as
the
romans
consulted
the
augurs
before
a
battle
giving
food
to
the
sacred
fowls
so
capitan
tiago
would
also
consult
his
augurs
with
the
modifications
befitting
the
times
and
the
new
truths
tie
would
watch
closely
the
flame
of
the
tapers
the
smoke
from
the
incense
the
voice
of
the
priest
and
from
it
all
attempt
to
forecast
his
luck
it
was
an
admitted
fact
that
he
lost
very
few
wagers
and
in
those
cases
it
was
due
to
the
unlucky
circumstance
that
the
officiating
priest
was
hoarse
or
that
the
were
few
or
contained
too
much
tallow
or
that
a
bad
piece
of
money
had
slipped
in
with
the
rest
the
warden
of
the
brotherhood
would
then
assure
him
that
such
reverses
were
tests
to
which
he
was
subjected
by
heaven
to
receive
assurance
of
his
fidelity
and
devotion
so
beloved
by
the
priests
respected
by
the
sacristans
humored
by
the
chinese
chandlers
and
the
dealers
in
fireworks
he
was
a
man
happy
in
the
religion
of
this
world
and
persons
of
discernment
and
great
piety
even
claimed
for
him
great
influence
in
the
celestial
court
that
he
was
at
peace
with
the
government
can
not
be
doubted
however
difficult
an
achievement
it
may
seem
incapable
of
any
new
idea
and
satisfied
with
his
he
was
ever
ready
to
gratify
the
desires
of
the
last
official
of
the
fifth
class
in
every
one
of
the
offices
to
make
presents
of
hams
capons
turkeys
and
chinese
fruits
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
if
he
heard
any
one
speak
ill
of
the
natives
he
who
did
not
consider
himself
as
such
would
join
in
the
chorus
and
speak
worse
of
them
if
any
one
aspersed
the
chinese
or
spanish
mestizos
he
would
do
the
same
perhaps
because
he
considered
himself
become
a
iberian
he
was
ever
first
to
talk
in
favor
of
any
new
imposition
of
taxes
or
special
assessment
especially
when
he
smelled
a
contract
or
a
farming
assignment
behind
it
he
always
had
an
orchestra
ready
for
congratulating
and
serenading
the
governors
judges
and
other
officials
on
their
and
birthdays
at
the
birth
or
death
of
a
relative
and
in
fact
at
every
variation
from
the
usual
monotony
for
such
occasions
he
would
secure
laudatory
poems
and
hymns
in
which
were
celebrated
the
kind
and
loving
governor
the
brave
and
courageous
judge
for
whom
there
awaits
in
heaven
the
palm
of
the
just
with
many
other
things
of
the
same
kind
he
was
the
president
of
the
rich
guild
of
mestizos
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
many
of
them
who
did
not
regard
him
as
one
of
themselves
in
the
two
years
that
he
held
this
office
he
wore
out
ten
frock
coats
an
equal
number
of
high
hats
and
half
a
dozen
canes
the
frock
coat
and
the
high
hat
were
in
evidence
at
the
ayuntamiento
in
the
palace
and
at
military
headquarters
the
high
hat
and
the
frock
coat
might
have
been
noticed
in
the
cockpit
in
the
market
in
the
processions
in
the
chinese
shops
and
under
the
hat
and
within
the
coat
might
have
been
seen
the
perspiring
capitan
tiago
waving
his
tasseled
cane
directing
arranging
and
throwing
everything
into
disorder
with
marvelous
activity
and
a
gravity
even
more
marvelous
so
the
authorities
saw
in
him
a
safe
man
gifted
with
the
best
of
dispositions
peaceful
tractable
and
obsequious
who
read
no
books
or
newspapers
from
spain
although
he
spoke
spanish
well
indeed
they
rather
looked
upon
him
with
the
feeling
with
which
a
poor
student
contemplates
the
heel
of
his
old
shoe
twisted
by
his
manner
of
walking
in
his
case
there
was
truth
in
both
the
christian
and
profane
proverbs
pauperes
and
and
there
might
well
be
applied
to
him
that
translation
according
to
some
people
incorrect
from
the
greek
glory
to
god
in
the
highest
and
peace
to
men
of
on
earth
even
though
we
shall
see
further
along
that
it
is
not
sufficient
for
men
to
have
in
order
to
live
in
peace
the
irreverent
considered
him
a
fool
the
poor
regarded
him
as
a
heartless
and
cruel
exploiter
of
misery
and
want
and
his
inferiors
saw
in
him
a
despot
and
a
tyrant
as
to
the
women
ah
the
women
accusing
rumors
buzzed
through
the
wretched
nipa
huts
and
it
was
said
that
wails
and
sobs
might
be
heard
mingled
with
the
weak
cries
of
an
infant
more
than
one
young
woman
was
pointed
out
by
her
neighbors
with
the
finger
of
scorn
she
had
a
downcast
glance
and
a
faded
cheek
but
such
things
never
robbed
him
of
sleep
nor
did
any
maiden
disturb
his
peace
it
was
an
old
woman
who
made
him
suffer
an
old
woman
who
was
his
rival
in
piety
and
who
had
gained
from
many
curates
such
enthusiastic
praises
and
eulogies
as
he
in
his
best
days
had
never
received
between
capitan
tiago
and
this
widow
who
had
inherited
from
brothers
and
cousins
there
existed
a
holy
rivalry
which
redounded
to
the
benefit
of
the
church
as
the
competition
among
the
pampanga
steamers
then
redounded
to
the
benefit
of
the
public
did
capitan
tiago
present
to
some
virgin
a
silver
wand
ornamented
with
emeralds
and
topazes
at
once
doña
patrocinio
had
ordered
another
of
gold
set
with
diamonds
if
at
the
time
of
the
naval
procession
capitan
tiago
erected
an
arch
with
two
façades
covered
with
ruffled
cloth
and
decorated
with
mirrors
glass
globes
and
chandeliers
then
doña
patrocinio
would
have
another
with
four
facades
six
feet
higher
and
more
gorgeous
hangings
then
he
would
fall
back
on
his
reserves
his
strong
point
his
specialty
masses
with
bombs
and
fireworks
whereat
doña
patrocinia
could
only
gnaw
at
her
lips
with
her
toothless
gums
because
being
exceedingly
nervous
she
could
not
endure
the
chiming
of
the
bells
and
still
less
the
explosions
of
the
bombs
while
he
smiled
in
triumph
she
would
plan
her
revenge
and
pay
the
money
of
others
to
secure
the
best
orators
of
the
five
orders
in
manila
the
most
famous
preachers
of
the
cathedral
and
even
the
paulists
to
preach
on
the
holy
days
upon
profound
theological
subjects
to
the
sinners
who
understood
only
the
vernacular
of
the
mariners
the
partizans
of
capitan
tiago
would
observe
that
she
slept
during
the
sermon
but
her
adherents
would
answer
that
the
sermon
was
paid
for
in
advance
and
by
her
and
that
in
any
affair
payment
was
the
prime
requisite
at
length
she
had
driven
him
from
the
field
completely
by
presenting
to
the
church
three
of
gilded
silver
each
one
of
which
cost
her
over
three
thousand
pesos
capitan
tiago
hoped
that
the
old
woman
would
breathe
her
last
almost
any
day
or
that
she
would
lose
five
or
six
of
her
lawsuits
so
that
he
might
be
alone
in
serving
god
but
unfortunately
the
best
lawyers
of
the
looked
after
her
interests
and
as
to
her
health
there
was
no
part
of
her
that
could
be
attacked
by
sickness
she
seemed
to
be
a
steel
wire
no
doubt
for
the
edification
of
souls
and
she
hung
on
in
this
vale
of
tears
with
the
tenacity
of
a
boil
on
the
skin
her
adherents
were
secure
in
the
belief
that
she
would
be
canonized
at
her
death
and
that
capitan
tiago
himself
would
have
to
worship
her
at
the
altars
all
of
which
he
agreed
to
and
cheerfully
promised
provided
only
that
she
die
soon
such
was
capitan
tiago
in
the
days
of
which
we
write
as
for
the
past
he
was
the
only
son
of
a
of
malabon
wealthy
enough
but
so
miserly
that
he
would
not
spend
a
cent
to
educate
his
son
for
which
reason
the
little
santiago
had
been
the
servant
of
a
good
dominican
a
worthy
man
who
had
tried
to
train
him
in
all
of
good
that
he
knew
and
could
teach
when
he
had
reached
the
happy
stage
of
being
known
among
his
acquaintances
as
a
that
is
when
he
began
to
study
logic
the
death
of
his
protector
soon
followed
by
that
of
his
father
put
an
end
to
his
studies
and
he
had
to
turn
his
attention
to
business
affairs
he
married
a
pretty
young
woman
of
santa
cruz
who
gave
him
social
position
and
helped
him
to
make
his
fortune
doña
pia
alba
was
not
satisfied
with
buying
and
selling
sugar
indigo
and
coffee
but
wished
to
plant
and
reap
so
the
couple
bought
land
in
san
diego
from
this
time
dated
their
friendship
with
padre
damoso
and
with
don
rafael
ibarra
the
richest
capitalist
of
the
town
the
lack
of
an
heir
in
the
first
six
years
of
their
wedded
life
made
of
that
eagerness
to
accumulate
riches
almost
a
censurable
ambition
doña
pia
was
comely
strong
and
healthy
yet
it
was
in
vain
that
she
offered
novenas
and
at
the
advice
of
the
devout
women
of
san
diego
made
a
pilgrimage
to
the
virgin
of
kaysaysay
in
taal
distributed
alms
to
the
poor
and
danced
at
midday
in
may
in
the
procession
of
the
virgin
of
turumba
in
pakil
but
it
was
all
with
no
result
until
fray
damaso
advised
her
to
go
to
obando
to
dance
in
the
fiesta
of
pascual
bailon
and
ask
him
for
a
son
now
it
is
well
known
that
there
is
in
obando
a
trinity
which
grants
sons
or
daughters
according
to
request
our
lady
of
salambaw
clara
and
pascual
thanks
to
this
wise
advice
doña
pia
soon
recognized
the
signs
of
approaching
motherhood
but
alas
like
the
fisherman
of
whom
shakespeare
tells
in
who
ceased
to
sing
when
he
had
found
a
treasure
she
at
once
lost
all
her
mirthfulness
fell
into
melancholy
and
was
never
seen
to
smile
again
capriciousness
natural
in
her
condition
commented
all
even
capitan
tiago
a
puerperal
fever
put
an
end
to
her
hidden
grief
and
she
died
leaving
behind
a
beautiful
girl
baby
for
whom
fray
damaso
himself
stood
sponsor
as
pascual
had
not
granted
the
son
that
was
asked
they
gave
the
child
the
name
of
maria
clara
in
honor
of
the
virgin
of
salambaw
and
clara
punishing
the
worthy
pascual
with
silence
the
little
girl
grew
up
under
the
care
of
her
aunt
isabel
that
good
old
lady
of
monkish
urbanity
whom
we
met
at
the
beginning
of
the
story
for
the
most
part
her
early
life
was
spent
in
san
diego
on
account
of
its
healthful
climate
and
there
padre
damaso
was
devoted
to
her
maria
clara
had
not
the
small
eyes
of
her
father
like
her
mother
she
had
eyes
large
black
merry
and
smiling
when
she
was
playing
but
sad
deep
and
pensive
in
moments
of
repose
as
a
child
her
hair
was
curly
and
almost
blond
her
straight
nose
was
neither
too
pointed
nor
too
flat
while
her
mouth
with
the
merry
dimples
at
the
corners
recalled
the
small
and
pleasing
one
of
her
mother
her
skin
had
the
fineness
of
an
and
was
white
as
cotton
according
to
her
perplexed
relatives
who
found
the
traces
of
capitan
tiago
paternity
in
her
small
and
shapely
ears
aunt
isabel
ascribed
her
features
to
the
longings
of
doña
pia
whom
she
remembered
to
have
seen
many
times
weeping
before
the
image
of
anthony
another
cousin
was
of
the
same
opinion
differing
only
in
the
choice
of
the
smut
as
for
her
it
was
either
the
virgin
herself
or
michael
a
famous
philosopher
who
was
the
cousin
of
capitan
tinong
and
who
had
memorized
the
amat
sought
for
the
true
explanation
in
planetary
influences
the
idol
of
all
maria
clara
grew
up
amidst
smiles
and
love
the
very
friars
showered
her
with
attentions
when
she
appeared
in
the
processions
dressed
in
white
her
abundant
hair
interwoven
with
tuberoses
and
sampaguitas
with
two
diminutive
wings
of
silver
and
gold
fastened
on
the
back
of
her
gown
and
carrying
in
her
hands
a
pair
of
white
doves
tied
with
blue
ribbons
afterwards
she
would
be
so
merry
and
talk
so
sweetly
in
her
childish
simplicity
that
the
enraptured
capitan
tiago
could
do
nothing
but
bless
the
saints
of
obando
and
advise
every
one
to
purchase
beautiful
works
of
sculpture
in
southern
countries
the
girl
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
years

into
a
woman
as
the
bud
of
the
night
becomes
a
flower
in
the
morning
at
this
period
of
change
so
full
of
mystery
and
romance
maria
clara
was
placed
by
the
advice
of
the
curate
of
binondo
in
the
nunnery
of
catherine
in
order
to
receive
strict
religious
training
from
the
sisters
with
tears
she
took
leave
of
padre
damaso
and
of
the
only
lad
who
had
been
a
friend
of
her
childhood
crisostomo
ibarra
who
himself
shortly
afterward
went
away
to
europe
there
in
that
convent
which
communicates
with
the
world
through
double
bars
even
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
the
nuns
she
spent
seven
years
each
having
his
own
particular
ends
in
view
and
knowing
the
mutual
inclinations
of
the
two
young
persons
don
rafael
and
capitan
tiago
agreed
upon
the
marriage
of
their
children
and
the
formation
of
a
business
partnership
this
agreement
which
was
concluded
some
years
after
the
younger
ibarra
departure
was
celebrated
with
equal
joy
by
two
hearts
in
widely
separated
parts
of
the
world

very
different
circumstances

early
to
mass

elegantly
dressed
and
wearing
a
rosary
of

partly
served
as

for

with

in

of

the
holy
communion
scarcely
had
the
priest
disappeared
from
the
altar
when
the
maiden
expressed
a
desire
for
returning
home
to
the
great
surprise
and
displeasure
of
her
good
aunt
who
believed
her
niece
to
be
as
pious

devoted
to
praying

in
working
at
a
silk
purse
while
her
aunt
was
trying
to
clean
up
the
traces
of
the
former
night
revelry
by
swinging
a
feather
duster
about
capitan
tiago
was
busy
looking
over
some
papers
every
noise
in
the
street
every
carriage
that
passed
caused
the
maiden
to
tremble
and
quickened
the
beatings
of
her
heart
now
she
wished
that
she
were
back
in
the
quiet
convent
among
her
friends
there
she
could
have
seen
him
without
emotion
and
agitation
but
was
he
not
the
companion
of
her
infancy
had
they
not
played
together
and
even
quarreled
at
times
the
reason
for
all
this
i
need
not
explain
if
you
o
reader
have
ever
loved
you
will
understand
and
if
you
have
not
it
is
useless
for
me
to
tell
you
as
the
uninitiated
do
not
comprehend
these
mysteries
i
believe
maria
that
the
doctor
is
right
said
capitan
tiago
you
ought
to
go
into
the
country
for
you
are
pale
and
need
fresh
air
what
do
you
think
of
malabon
or
san
diego
at
the
mention
of
the
latter
place
maria
clara
blushed
like
a
poppy
and
was
unable
to
answer
you
and
isabel
can
go
at
once
to
the
convent
to
get
your
clothes
and
to
say
to
your
friends
he
continued
without
raising
his
head
you
will
not
stay
there
any
longer
the
girl
felt
the
vague
sadness
that
possesses
the
mind
when
we
leave
forever
a
place
where
we
have
been
happy
but
another
thought
softened
this
sorrow
in
four
or
five
days
after
you
get
some
new
clothes
made
go
to
malabon
your
godfather
is
no
longer
in
san
diego
the
priest
that
you
may
have
noticed
here
last
night
that
young
padre
is
the
new
curate
whom
we
have
there
and
he
is
a
saint
i
think
that
san
diego
would
be
better
cousin
observed
aunt
isabel
besides
our
house
there
is
better
and
the
time
for
the
fiesta
draws
near
maria
clara
wanted
to
embrace
her
aunt
for
this
speech
but
hearing
a
carriage
stop
she
turned
pale
ah
very
true
answered
capitan
tiago
and
then
in
a
different
tone
he
exclaimed
don
crisostomo
the
maiden
let
her
sewing
fall
from
her
hands
and
wished
to
move
but
could
not
a
violent
tremor
ran
through
her
body
steps
were
heard
on
the
stairway
and
then
a
fresh
manly
voice
as
if
that
voice
had
some
magic
power
the
maiden
controlled
her
emotion
and
ran
to
hide
in
the
oratory
among
the
saints
the
two
cousins
laughed
and
ibarra
even
heard
the
noise
of
the
door
closing
pale
and
breathing
rapidly
the
maiden
pressed
her
beating
heart
and
tried
to
listen
she
heard
his
voice
that
beloved
voice
that
for
so
long
a
time
she
had
heard
only
in
her
dreams
he
was
asking
for
her
overcome
with
joy
she
kissed
the
nearest
saint
which
happened
to
be
anthony
the
abbot
a
saint
happy
in
flesh
and
in
wood
ever
the
object
of
pleasing
temptations
afterwards
she
sought
the
keyhole
in
order
to
see
and
examine
him
she
smiled
and
when
her
aunt
snatched
her
from
that
position
she
unconsciously
threw
her
arms
around
the
old
lady
neck
and
rained
kisses
upon
her
foolish
child
what
the
matter
with
you
the
old
lady
was
at
last
able
to
say
as
she
wiped
a
tear
from
her
faded
eyes
maria
clara
felt
ashamed
and
covered
her
eyes
with
her
plump
arm
come
on
get
ready
come
added
the
old
aunt
fondly
while
he
is
talking
to
your
father
about
you
come
do
make
him
wait
like
a
child
the
maiden
obediently
followed
her
and
they
shut
themselves
up
in
her
chamber
capitan
tiago
and
ibarra
were
conversing
in
a
lively
manner
when
aunt
isabel
appeared
half
dragging
her
niece
who
was
looking
in
every
direction
except
toward
the
persons
in
the
room
what
said
those
two
souls
communicating
through
the
language
of
the
eyes
more
perfect
than
that
of
the
lips
the
language
given
to
the
soul
in
order
that
sound
may
not
mar
the
ecstasy
of
feeling
in
such
moments
when
the
thoughts
of
two
happy
beings
penetrate
into
each
other
souls
through
the
eyes
the
spoken
word
is
halting
rude
and
weak
it
is
as
the
harsh
slow
roar
of
the
thunder
compared
with
the
rapidity
of
the
dazzling
lightning
flash
expressing
feelings
already
recognized
ideas
already
understood
and
if
words
are
made
use
of
it
is
only
because
the
heart
desire
dominating
all
the
being
and
flooding
it
with
happiness
wills
that
the
whole
human
organism
with
all
its
physical
and
psychical
powers
give
expression
to
the
song
of
joy
that
rolls
through
the
soul
to
the
questioning
glance
of
love
as
it
flashes
out
and
then
conceals
itself
speech
has
no
reply
the
smile
the
kiss
the
sigh
answer
soon
the
two
lovers
fleeing
from
the
dust
raised
by
aunt
broom
found
themselves
on
the
azotea
where
they
could
commune
in
liberty
among
the
little
arbors
what
did
they
tell
each
other
in
murmurs
that
you
nod
your
heads
o
little
red
cypress
flowers
tell
it
you
who
have
fragrance
in
your
breath
and
color
on
your
lips
and
thou
o
zephyr
who
learnest
rare
harmonies
in
the
stillness
of
the
dark
night
amid
the
hidden
depths
of
our
virgin
forests
tell
it
o
sunbeams
brilliant
manifestation
upon
earth
of
the
eternal
sole
immaterial
essence
in
a
material
world
you
tell
it
for
i
only
know
how
to
relate
prosaic
commonplaces
but
since
you
seem
unwilling
to
do
so
i
am
going
to
try
myself
the
sky
was
blue
and
a
fresh
breeze
not
yet
laden
with
the
fragrance
of
roses
stirred
the
leaves
and
flowers
of
the
vines
that
is
why
the
cypresses
the
orchids
the
dried
fishes
and
the
chinese
lanterns
were
trembling
the
splash
of
paddles
in
the
muddy
waters
of
the
river
and
the
rattle
of
carriages
and
carts
passing
over
the
binondo
bridge
came
up
to
them
distinctly
although
they
did
not
hear
what
the
old
aunt
murmured
as
she
saw
where
they
were
that
better
there
be
watched
by
the
whole
neighborhood
at
first
they
talked
nonsense
giving
utterance
only
to
those
sweet
inanities
which
are
so
much
like
the
boastings
of
the
nations
of
europe
pleasing
and
at
home
but
causing
foreigners
to
laugh
or
frown
she
like
a
sister
of
cain
was
of
course
jealous
and
asked
her
sweetheart
have
you
always
thought
of
me
have
you
never
forgotten
me
on
all
your
travels
in
the
great
cities
among
so
many
beautiful
women
he
too
was
a
brother
of
cain
and
sought
to
evade
such
questions
making
use
of
a
little
fiction
could
i
forget
you
he
answered
as
he
gazed
enraptured
into
her
dark
eyes
could
i
be
faithless
to
my
oath
my
sacred
oath
do
you
remember
that
stormy
night
when
you
saw
me
weeping
alone
by
the
side
of
my
dead
mother
and
drawing
near
to
me
you
put
your
hand
on
my
shoulder
that
hand
which
for
so
long
a
time
you
had
not
allowed
me
to
touch
saying
to
me
have
lost
your
mother
while
i
never
had
one
and
you
wept
with
me
you
loved
her
and
she
looked
upon
you
as
a
daughter
outside
it
rained
and
the
lightning
flashed
but
within
i
seemed
to
hear
music
and
to
see
a
smile
on
the
pallid
face
of
the
dead
oh
that
my
parents
were
alive
and
might
behold
you
now
i
then
caught
your
hand
along
with
the
hand
of
my
mother
and
swore
to
love
you
and
to
make
you
happy
whatever
fortune
heaven
might
have
in
store
for
me
and
that
oath
which
has
never
weighed
upon
me
as
a
burden
i
now
renew
could
i
forget
you
the
thought
of
you
has
ever
been
with
me
strengthening
me
amid
the
dangers
of
travel
and
has
been
a
comfort
to
my
soul
loneliness
in
foreign
lands
the
thoughts
of
you
have
neutralized
the
of
europe
which
erases
from
the
memories
of
so
many
of
our
countrymen
the
hopes
and
misfortunes
of
our
fatherland
in
dreams
i
saw
you
standing
on
the
shore
at
manila
gazing
at
the
far
horizon
wrapped
in
the
warm
light
of
the
early
dawn
i
heard
the
slow
sad
song
that
awoke
in
me
sleeping
affections
and
called
back
to
the
memory
of
my
heart
the
first
years
of
our
childhood
our
joys
our
pleasures
and
all
that
happy
past
which
you
gave
life
to
while
you
were
in
our
town
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
were
the
fairy
the
spirit
the
poetic
incarnation
of
my
fatherland
beautiful
unaffected
lovable
frank
a
true
daughter
of
the
philippines
that
beautiful
land
which
unites
with
the
imposing
virtues
of
the
mother
country
spain
the
admirable
qualities
of
a
young
people
as
you
unite
in
your
being
all
that
is
beautiful
and
lovely
the
inheritance
of
both
races
so
indeed
the
love
of
you
and
that
of
my
fatherland
have
become
fused
into
one
could
i
forget
you
many
times
have
i
thought
that
i
heard
the
sound
of
your
piano
and
the
accents
of
your
voice
when
in
germany
as
i
wandered
at
twilight
in
the
woods
peopled
with
the
fantastic
creations
of
its
poets
and
the
mysterious
legends
of
past
generations
always
i
called
upon
your
name
imagining
that
i
saw
you
in
the
mists
that
rose
from
the
depths
of
the
valley
or
i
fancied
that
i
heard
your
voice
in
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
when
from
afar
i
heard
the
songs
of
the
peasants
as
they
returned
from
their
labors
it
seemed
to
me
that
their
tones
harmonized
with
my
inner
voices
that
they
were
singing
for
and
thus
they
lent
reality
to
my
illusions
and
dreams
at
times
i
became
lost
among
the
mountain
paths
and
while
the
night
descended
slowly
as
it
does
there
i
would
find
myself
still
wandering
seeking
my
way
among
the
pines
and
beeches
and
oaks
then
when
some
scattering
rays
of
moonlight
slipped
down
into
the
clear
spaces
left
in
the
dense
foliage
i
seemed
to
see
you
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
as
a
dim
loving
shade
wavering
about
between
the
spots
of
light
and
shadow
if
perhaps
the
nightingale
poured
forth
his
varied
trills
i
fancied
it
was
because
he
saw
you
and
was
inspired
by
you
have
i
thought
of
you
the
fever
of
love
not
only
gave
warmth
to
the
snows
but
colored
the
ice
the
beautiful
skies
of
italy
with
their
clear
depths
reminded
me
of
your
eyes
its
sunny
landscape
spoke
to
me
of
your
smile
the
plains
of
andalusia
with
their
airs
peopled
with
oriental
memories
full
of
romance
and
color
told
me
of
your
love
on
dreamy
moonlit
nights
while
boating
oil
the
rhine
i
have
asked
myself
if
my
fancy
did
not
deceive
me
as
i
saw
you
among
the
poplars
on
the
banks
on
the
rocks
of
the
lorelei
or
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
singing
in
the
silence
of
the
night
as
if
you
were
a
comforting
fairy
maiden
sent
to
enliven
the
solitude
and
sadness
of
those
ruined
castles
i
have
not
traveled
like
you
so
i
know
only
your
town
and
manila
and
antipolo
she
answered
with
a
smile
which
showed
that
she
believed
all
he
said
but
since
i
said
to
you
and
entered
the
convent
i
have
always
thought
of
you
and
have
only
put
you
out
of
my
mind
when
ordered
to
do
so
by
my
confessor
who
imposed
many
penances
upon
me
i
recalled
our
games
and
our
quarrels
when
we
were
children
you
used
to
pick
up
the
most
beautiful
shells
and
search
in
the
river
for
the
roundest
and
smoothest
pebbles
of
different
colors
that
we
might
play
games
with
them
you
were
very
stupid
and
always
lost
and
by
way
of
a
forfeit
i
would
slap
you
with
the
palm
of
my
hand
but
i
always
tried
not
to
strike
you
hard
for
i
had
pity
on
you
in
those
games
you
cheated
much
even
more
than
i
did
and
we
used
to
finish
our
play
in
a
quarrel
do
you
remember
that
time
when
you
became
really
angry
at
me
then
you
made
me
suffer
but
afterwards
when
i
thought
of
it
in
the
convent
i
smiled
and
longed
for
you
so
that
we
might
quarrel
again
so
that
we
might
once
more
make
up
we
were
still
children
and
had
gone
with
your
mother
to
bathe
in
the
brook
under
the
shade
of
the
thick
bamboo
on
the
banks
grew
many
flowers
and
plants
whose
strange
names
you
told
me
in
latin
and
spanish
for
you
were
even
then
studying
in
the
ateneo
i
paid
no
attention
but
amused
myself
by
running
after
the
and
the
butterflies
with
their
rainbow
colors
and
tints
of
as
they
swarmed
about
among
the
flowers
sometimes
i
tried
to
surprise
them
with
my
hands
or
to
catch
the
little
fishes
that
slipped
rapidly
about
amongst
the
moss
and
stones
in
the
edge
of
the
water
once
you
disappeared
suddenly
and
when
you
returned
you
brought
a
crown
of
leaves
and
orange
blossoms
which
you
placed
upon
my
head
calling
me
chloe
for
yourself
you
made
one
of
vines
but
your
mother
snatched
away
my
crown
and
after
mashing
it
with
a
stone
mixed
it
with
the
with
which
she
was
going
to
wash
our
heads
the
tears
came
into
your
eyes
and
you
said
that
she
did
not
understand
mythology
boy
your
mother
exclaimed
see
how
sweet
your
hair
will
smell
afterwards
i
laughed
but
you
were
offended
and
would
not
talk
with
me
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
appeared
so
serious
that
then
i
wanted
to
cry
on
our
way
back
to
the
town
through
the
hot
sun
i
picked
some
sage
leaves
that
grew
beside
the
path
and
gave
them
to
you
to
put
in
your
hat
so
that
you
might
not
get
a
headache
you
smiled
and
caught
my
hand
and
we
made
up
ibarra
smiled
with
happiness
as
he
opened
his
pocketbook
and
took
from
it
a
piece
of
paper
in
which
were
wrapped
some
dry
blackened
leaves
which
gave
off
a
sweet
odor
your
sage
leaves
he
said
in
answer
to
her
inquiring
look
this
is
all
that
you
have
ever
given
me
she
in
turn
snatched
from
her
bosom
a
little
pouch
of
white
satin
you
must
not
touch
this
she
said
tapping
the
palm
of
his
hand
lightly
it
a
letter
of
farewell
the
one
i
wrote
to
you
before
leaving
have
you
ever
written
me
any
other
sir
and
what
did
i
say
to
you
then
many
fibs
excuses
of
a
delinquent
debtor
she
answered
smilingly
thus
giving
him
to
understand
how
sweet
to
her
those
fibs
were
be
quiet
now
and
i
read
it
to
you
i
leave
out
your
fine
phrases
in
order
not
to
make
a
martyr
of
you
raising
the
paper
to
the
height
of
her
eyes
so
that
the
youth
might
not
see
her
face
she
began
but
i
not
read
what
follows
that
because
it
not
true
her
eyes
ran
along
some
lines
father
wishes
me
to
go
away
in
spite
of
all
my
pleadings
are
a
man
now
he
told
me
you
must
think
about
your
future
and
about
your
duties
you
must
learn
the
science
of
life
a
thing
which
your
fatherland
can
not
teach
you
so
that
you
may
some
day
be
useful
to
it
if
you
remain
here
in
my
shadow
in
this
environment
of
business
affairs
you
will
not
learn
to
look
far
ahead
the
day
in
which
you
lose
me
you
will
find
yourself
like
the
plant
of
which
our
poet
baltazar
tells
grown
in
the
water
its
leaves
wither
at
the
least
scarcity
of
moisture
and
a
moment
heat
dries
it
up
do
you
understand
you
are
almost
a
young
man
and
yet
you
weep
these
reproaches
hurt
me
and
i
confessed
that
i
loved
you
my
father
reflected
for
a
time
in
silence
and
then
placing
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
said
in
a
trembling
voice
you
think
that
you
alone
know
how
to
love
that
your
father
does
not
love
you
and
that
he
will
not
feel
the
separation
from
you
it
is
only
a
short
time
since
we
lost
your
mother
and
i
must
journey
on
alone
toward
old
age
toward
the
very
time
of
life
when
i
would
seek
help
and
comfort
from
your
youth
yet
i
accept
my
loneliness
hardly
knowing
whether
i
shall
ever
see
you
again
but
you
must
think
of
other
and
greater
things
the
future
lies
open
before
you
while
for
me
it
is
already
passing
behind
your
love
is
just
awakening
while
mine
is
dying
fire
burns
in
your
blood
while
the
chill
is
creeping
into
mine
yet
you
weep
and
can
not
sacrifice
the
present
for
the
future
useful
as
it
may
be
alike
to
yourself
and
to
your
country
my
father
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
i
fell
upon
my
knees
at
his
feet
i
embraced
him
i
begged
his
forgiveness
and
i
assured
him
that
i
was
ready
to
set
out
ibarra
growing
agitation
caused
her
to
suspend
the
reading
for
he
had
grown
pale
and
was
pacing
back
and
forth
what
the
matter
what
is
troubling
you
she
asked
him
you
have
almost
made
me
forget
that
i
have
my
duties
that
i
must
leave
at
once
for
the
town
tomorrow
is
the
day
for
commemorating
the
dead
maria
clara
silently
fixed
her
large
dreamy
eyes
upon
him
for
a
few
moments
and
then
picking
some
flowers
she
said
with
emotion
go
i
wo
detain
you
longer
in
a
few
days
we
shall
see
each
other
again
lay
these
flowers
on
the
tomb
of
your
parents
a
few
moments
later
the
youth
descended
the
stairway
accompanied
by
capitan
tiago
and
aunt
isabel
while
maria
clara
shut
herself
up
in
the
oratory
please
tell
andeng
to
get
the
house
ready
as
maria
and
isabel
are
coming
a
pleasant
journey
said
capitan
tiago
as
ibarra
stepped
into
the
carriage
which
at
once
started
in
the
direction
of
the
plaza
of
san
gabriel
afterwards
by
way
of
consolation
her
father
said
to
maria
clara
who
was
weeping
beside
an
image
of
the
virgin
come
light
two
candles
worth
two
reals
each
one
to
roch
and
one
to
raphael
the
protector
of
travelers
light
the
lamp
of
our
lady
of
peace
and
prosperous
voyages
since
there
are
so
many
tulisanes
it
better
to
spend
four
reals
for
wax
and
six
cuartos
for
oil
now
than
to
pay
a
big
ransom
later
chapter
viii
recollections
ibarra
carriage
was
passing
through
a
part
of
the
busiest
district
in
manila
the
same
which
the
night
before
had
made
him
feel
sad
but
which
by
daylight
caused
him
to
smile
in
spite
of
himself
the
movement
in
every
part
so
many
carriages
coming
and
going
at
full
speed
the
carromatas
and
calesas
the
europeans
the
chinese
the
natives
each
in
his
own
peculiar
costume
the
the
the
naked
porters
the
grocery
stores
the
lunch
stands
and
restaurants
the
shops
and
even
the
carts
drawn
by
the
impassive
and
indifferent
carabao
who
seems
to
amuse
himself
in
carrying
burdens
while
he
patiently
ruminates
all
this
noise
and
confusion
the
very
sun
itself
the
distinctive
odors
and
the
motley
colors
awoke
in
the
youth
mind
a
world
of
sleeping
recollections
those
streets
had
not
yet
been
paved
and
two
successive
days
of
sunshine
filled
them
with
dust
which
covered
everything
and
made
the
cough
while
it
nearly
blinded
him
a
day
of
rain
formed
pools
of
muddy
water
which
at
night
reflected
the
carriage
lights
and
splashed
mud
a
distance
of
several
yards
away
upon
the
pedestrians
on
the
narrow
sidewalks
and
how
many
women
have
left
their
embroidered
slippers
in
those
waves
of
mud
then
there
might
have
been
seen
repairing
those
streets
the
lines
of
convicts
with
their
shaven
heads
dressed
in
camisas
and
pantaloons
that
reached
only
to
their
knees
each
with
his
letter
and
number
in
blue
on
their
legs
were
chains
partly
wrapped
in
dirty
rags
to
ease
the
chafing
or
perhaps
the
chill
of
the
iron
joined
two
by
two
scorched
in
the
sun
worn
out
by
the
heat
and
fatigue
they
were
lashed
and
goaded
by
a
whip
in
the
hands
of
one
of
their
own
number
who
perhaps
consoled
himself
with
this
power
of
maltreating
others
they
were
tall
men
with
somber
faces
which
he
had
never
seen
brightened
with
the
light
of
a
smile
yet
their
eyes
gleamed
when
the
whistling
lash
fell
upon
their
shoulders
or
when
a
threw
them
the
chewed
and
broken
stub
of
a
cigar
which
the
nearest
would
snatch
up
and
hide
in
his
salakot
while
the
rest
remained
gazing
at
the
with
strange
looks
the
noise
of
the
stones
being
crushed
to
fill
the
puddles
and
the
merry
clank
of
the
heavy
fetters
on
the
swollen
ankles
seemed
to
remain
with
ibarra
he
shuddered
as
he
recalled
a
scene
that
had
made
a
deep
impression
on
his
childish
imagination
it
was
a
hot
afternoon
and
the
burning
rays
of
the
sun
fell
perpendicularly
upon
a
large
cart
by
the
side
of
which
was
stretched
out
one
of
those
unfortunates
lifeless
yet
with
his
eyes
half
opened
two
others
were
silently
preparing
a
bamboo
bier
showing
no
signs
of
anger
or
sorrow
or
impatience
for
such
is
the
character
attributed
to
the
natives
today
it
is
you
tomorrow
it
will
be
i
they
say
to
themselves
the
people
moved
rapidly
about
without
giving
heed
women
came
up
and
after
a
look
of
curiosity
continued
unconcerned
on
their
way
it
was
such
a
common
sight
that
their
hearts
had
become
callous
carriages
passed
flashing
back
from
their
varnished
sides
the
rays
of
the
sun
that
burned
in
a
cloudless
sky
only
he
a
child
of
eleven
years
and
fresh
from
the
country
was
moved
and
to
him
alone
it
brought
bad
dreams
on
the
following
night
there
no
longer
existed
the
useful
and
honored
de
the
good
filipino
pontoon
bridge
that
had
done
its
best
to
be
of
service
in
spite
of
its
natural
imperfections
and
its
rising
and
falling
at
the
caprice
of
the
pasig
which
had
more
than
once
abused
it
and
finally
destroyed
it
the
almond
trees
in
the
plaza
of
san
gabriel
had
not
grown
they
were
still
in
the
same
feeble
and
stunted
condition
the
escolta
appeared
less
beautiful
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
an
imposing
building
with
caryatids
carved
on
its
front
now
occupied
the
place
of
the
old
row
of
shops
the
new
bridge
of
spain
caught
his
attention
while
the
houses
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
among
the
clumps
of
bamboo
and
trees
where
the
escolta
ends
and
the
isla
de
romero
begins
reminded
him
of
the
cool
mornings
when
he
used
to
pass
there
in
a
boat
on
his
way
to
the
baths
of
he
met
many
carriages
drawn
by
beautiful
pairs
of
dwarfish
ponies
within
which
were
government
clerks
who
seemed
yet
half
asleep
as
they
made
their
way
to
their
offices
or
military
officers
or
chinese
in
foolish
and
ridiculous
attitudes
or
gave
friars
and
canons
in
an
elegant
victoria
he
thought
he
recognized
padre
damaso
grave
and
frowning
but
he
had
already
passed
now
he
was
pleasantly
greeted
by
capitan
tinong
who
was
passing
in
a
carretela
with
his
wife
and
two
daughters
as
they
went
down
off
the
bridge
the
horses
broke
into
a
trot
along
the
sabana
drive
on
the
left
the
arroceros
cigar
factory
resounded
with
the
noise
of
the
pounding
the
tobacco
leaves
and
ibarra
was
unable
to
restrain
a
smile
as
he
thought
of
the
strong
odor
which
about
five
in
the
afternoon
used
to
float
all
over
the
de
and
which
had
made
him
sick
when
he
was
a
child
the
lively
conversations
and
the
repartee
of
the
crowds
from
the
cigar
factories
carried
him
back
to
the
district
of
lavapiés
in
madrid
with
its
riots
of
so
fatal
for
the
unfortunate
policemen
the
botanical
garden
drove
away
these
agreeable
recollections
the
demon
of
comparison
brought
before
his
mind
the
botanical
gardens
of
europe
in
countries
where
great
labor
and
much
money
are
needed
to
make
a
single
leaf
grow
or
one
flower
open
its
calyx
he
recalled
those
of
the
colonies
where
they
are
well
supplied
and
tended
and
all
open
to
the
public
ibarra
turned
away
his
gaze
toward
the
old
manila
surrounded
still
by
its
walls
and
moats
like
a
sickly
girl
wrapped
in
the
garments
of
her
grandmother
better
days
then
the
sight
of
the
sea
losing
itself
in
the
distance
on
the
other
shore
lies
europe
thought
the
young
man
europe
with
its
attractive
peoples
in
constant
movement
in
the
search
for
happiness
weaving
their
dreams
in
the
morning
and
disillusioning
themselves
at
the
setting
of
the
sun
happy
even
in
the
midst
of
their
calamities
yes
on
the
farther
shore
of
the
boundless
sea
are
the
really
spiritual
nations
those
who
even
though
they
put
no
restraints
on
material
development
are
still
more
spiritual
than
those
who
pride
themselves
on
adoring
only
the
spirit
but
these
musings
were
in
turn
banished
from
his
mind
as
he
came
in
sight
of
the
little
mound
in
bagumbayan
field
this
isolated
knoll
at
the
side
of
the
luneta
now
caught
his
attention
and
made
him
reminiscent
he
thought
of
the
man
who
had
awakened
his
intellect
and
made
him
understand
goodness
and
justice
the
ideas
which
that
man
had
impressed
upon
him
were
not
many
to
be
sure
but
they
were
not
meaningless
repetitions
they
were
convictions
which
had
not
paled
in
the
light
of
the
most
brilliant
foci
of
progress
that
man
was
an
old
priest
whose
words
of
farewell
still
resounded
in
his
ears
do
not
forget
that
if
knowledge
is
the
heritage
of
mankind
it
is
only
the
courageous
who
inherit
it
he
had
reminded
him
i
have
tried
to
pass
on
to
you
what
i
got
from
my
teachers
the
sum
of
which
i
have
endeavored
to
increase
and
transmit
to
the
coming
generation
as
far
as
in
me
lay
you
will
now
do
the
same
for
those
who
come
after
you
and
you
can
treble
it
since
you
are
going
to
rich
countries
then
he
had
added
with
a
smile
they
come
here
seeking
wealth
go
you
to
their
country
to
seek
also
that
other
wealth
which
we
lack
but
remember
that
all
that
glitters
is
not
gold
the
old
man
had
died
on
that
spot
at
these
recollections
the
youth
murmured
audibly
no
in
spite
of
everything
the
fatherland
first
first
the
philippines
the
child
of
spain
first
the
spanish
fatherland
no
that
which
is
decreed
by
fate
does
not
tarnish
the
honor
of
the
fatherland
no
he
gave
little
heed
to
ermita
the
phenix
of
nipa
that
had
rearisen
from
its
ashes
under
the
form
of
blue
and
white
houses
with
roofs
of
corrugated
iron
nor
was
his
attention
caught
by
malate
neither
by
the
cavalry
barracks
with
the
spreading
trees
in
front
nor
by
the
inhabitants
or
their
little
nipa
huts
pyramidal
or
prismatic
in
shape
hidden
away
among
the
banana
plants
and
areca
palms
constructed
like
nests
by
each
father
of
a
family
the
carriage
continued
on
its
way
meeting
now
and
then
carromatas
drawn
by
one
or
two
ponies
whose
abaka
harness
indicated
that
they
were
from
the
country
the
drivers
would
try
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
occupant
of
the
fine
carriage
but
would
pass
on
without
exchanging
a
word
without
a
single
salute
at
times
a
heavy
cart
drawn
by
a
slow
and
indifferent
carabao
would
appear
on
the
dusty
road
over
which
beat
the
brilliant
sunlight
of
the
tropics
the
mournful
and
monotonous
song
of
the
driver
mounted
on
the
back
of
the
carabao
would
be
mingled
at
one
time
with
the
screechings
of
a
dry
wheel
on
the
huge
axle
of
the
heavy
vehicle
or
at
another
time
with
the
dull
scraping
of
runners
on
a
sledge
which
was
dragged
heavily
through
the
dust
and
over
the
ruts
in
the
road
in
the
fields
and
wide
meadows
the
herds
were
grazing
attended
ever
by
the
white
which
roosted
peacefully
on
the
backs
of
the
animals
while
these
chewed
their
cuds
or
browsed
in
lazy
contentment
upon
the
rich
grass
in
the
distance
ponies
frisked
jumping
and
running
about
pursued
by
the
lively
colts
with
long
tails
and
abundant
manes
who
whinnied
and
pawed
the
ground
with
their
hard
hoofs
let
us
leave
the
youth
dreaming
or
dozing
since
neither
the
sad
nor
the
animated
poetry
of
the
open
country
held
his
attention
for
him
there
was
no
charm
in
the
sun
that
gleamed
upon
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
caused
the
rustics
with
feet
burned
by
the
hot
ground
in
spite
of
their
callousness
to
hurry
along
or
that
made
the
villager
pause
beneath
the
shade
of
an
almond
tree
or
a
bamboo
brake
while
he
pondered
upon
vague
and
inexplicable
things
while
the
youth
carriage
sways
along
like
a
drunken
thing
on
account
of
the
inequalities
in
the
surface
of
the
road
when
passing
over
a
bamboo
bridge
or
going
up
an
incline
or
descending
a
steep
slope
let
us
return
to
manila
chapter
ix
local
affairs
ibarra
had
not
been
mistaken
about
the
occupant
of
the
victoria
for
it
was
indeed
padre
damaso
and
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
house
which
the
youth
had
just
left
where
are
you
going
asked
the
friar
of
maria
clara
and
aunt
isabel
who
were
about
to
enter
a
carriage
in
the
midst
of
his
preoccupation
padre
damaso
stroked
the
maiden
cheek
lightly
to
the
convent
to
get
my
things
answered
the
latter
ahaa
aha
we
see
who
stronger
we
see
muttered
the
friar
abstractedly
as
with
bowed
head
and
slow
step
he
turned
to
the
stairway
leaving
the
two
women
not
a
little
amazed
he
must
have
a
sermon
to
preach
and
is
memorizing
it
commented
aunt
isabel
get
in
maria
or
we
be
late
whether
or
not
padre
damaso
was
preparing
a
sermon
we
can
not
say
but
it
is
certain
that
some
grave
matter
filled
his
mind
for
he
did
not
extend
his
hand
to
capitan
tiago
who
had
almost
to
get
down
on
his
knees
to
kiss
it
santiago
said
the
friar
at
once
i
have
an
important
matter
to
talk
to
you
about
let
go
into
your
office
capitan
tiago
began
to
feel
uneasy
so
much
so
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
but
he
obeyed
following
the
heavy
figure
of
the
priest
who
closed
the
door
behind
him
while
they
confer
in
secret
let
us
learn
what
fray
sibyla
has
been
doing
the
astute
dominican
is
not
at
the
rectory
for
very
soon
after
celebrating
mass
he
had
gone
to
the
convent
of
his
order
situated
just
inside
the
gate
of
isabel
ii
or
of
magellan
according
to
what
family
happened
to
be
reigning
in
madrid
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
rich
odor
of
chocolate
or
to
the
rattle
of
boxes
and
coins
which
came
from
the
treasury
and
scarcely
acknowledging
the
respectful
and
deferential
salute
of
the
he
entered
passed
along
several
corridors
and
knocked
at
a
door
come
in
sighed
a
weak
voice
may
god
restore
health
to
your
reverence
was
the
young
greeting
as
he
entered
seated
in
a
large
armchair
was
an
aged
priest
wasted
and
rather
sallow
like
the
saints
that
rivera
painted
his
eyes
were
sunken
in
their
hollow
sockets
over
which
his
heavy
eyebrows
were
almost
always
contracted
thus
accentuating
their
brilliant
gleam
padre
sibyla
with
his
arms
crossed
under
the
venerable
scapulary
of
dominic
gazed
at
him
feelingly
then
bowed
his
head
and
waited
in
silence
ah
sighed
the
old
man
they

my
age

his
eyes
slowly
and
fixed
them
on
the
sick
face
what
has
your
reverence
decided
to
do
he
asked
to
die
ah
what
else
can
i
do
i
am
suffering
too
much
but
i
have
made
many
suffer
i
am
paying
my
debt
and
how
are
you
what
has
brought
you
here
i
come
to
talk
about
the
business
which
you
committed
to
my
care
ah
what
about
it
pish
answered
the
young
man
disgustedly
as
he
seated
himself
and
turned
away
his
face
with
a
contemptuous
expression
been
telling
us
fairy
tales
young
ibarra
is
a
youth
of
discernment
he
does
seem
to
be
a
fool
but
i
believe
that
he
is
a
good
lad
you
believe
so
hostilities
began
last
night
already
how
fray
sibyla
then
recounted
briefly
what
had
taken
place
between
padre
damaso
and
ibarra
besides
he
said
in
conclusion
the
young
man
is
going
to
marry
capitan
tiago
daughter
who
was
educated
in
the
college
of
our
sisterhood
he
rich
and
wo
care
to
make
enemies
and
to
run
the
risk
of
ruining
his
fortune
and
his
happiness
the
sick
man
nodded
in
agreement
yes
i
think
as
you
do
with
a
wife
like
that
and
such
a
we
own
him
body
and
soul
if
not
so
much
the
better
for
him
to
declare
himself
an
enemy
of
ours
fray
sibyla
looked
at
the
old
man
in
surprise
for
the
good
of
our
holy
order
i
mean
of
course
he
added
breathing
heavily
i
prefer
open
attacks
to
the
silly
praises
and
flatteries
of
friends
which
are
really
paid
for
does
your
reverence
think
the
old
man
regarded
him
sadly
keep
it
clearly
before
you
he
answered
gasping
for
breath
our
power
will
last
as
long
as
it
is
believed
in
if
they
attack
us
the
government
will
say
attack
them
because
they
see
in
them
an
obstacle
to
their
liberty
so
then
let
us
preserve
them
but
if
it
should
listen
to
them
sometimes
the
government
it
will
not
listen
nevertheless
if
led
on
by
cupidity
it
should
come
to
wish
for
itself
what
we
are
taking
in
if
there
should
be
some
bold
and
daring
one
then
woe
unto
that
one
both
remained
silent
for
a
time
then
the
sick
man
continued
besides
we
need
their
attacks
to
keep
us
awake
that
makes
us
see
our
weaknesses
so
that
we
may
remedy
them
exaggerated
flattery
will
deceive
us
and
put
us
to
sleep
while
outside
our
walls
we
shall
be
laughed
at
and
the
day
in
which
we
become
an
object
of
ridicule
we
shall
fall
as
we
fell
in
europe
money
will
not
flow
into
our
churches
no
one
will
buy
our
scapularies
or
girdles
or
anything
else
and
when
we
cease
to
be
rich
we
shall
no
longer
be
able
to
control
consciences
but
we
shall
always
have
our
estates
our
property
all
will
be
lost
as
we
lost
them
in
europe
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
we
are
working
toward
our
own
ruin
for
example
this
unrestrained
eagerness
to
raise
arbitrarily
the
rents
on
our
lands
each
year
this
eagerness
which
i
have
so
vainly
combated
in
all
the
chapters
this
will
ruin
us
the
native
sees
himself
obliged
to
purchase
farms
in
other
places
which
bring
him
as
good
returns
as
ours
or
better
i
fear
that
we
are
already
on
the
decline
vult
perdere
jupiter
dementat
for
this
reason
we
should
not
increase
our
burden
the
people
are
already
murmuring
you
have
decided
well
let
us
leave
the
others
to
settle
their
accounts
in
that
quarter
let
us
preserve
the
prestige
that
remains
to
us
and
as
we
shall
soon
appear
before
god
let
us
wash
our
hands
of
it
and
may
the
god
of
mercy
have
pity
on
our
weakness
so
your
reverence
thinks
that
the
rent
or
tax
let
not
talk
any
more
about
money
interrupted
the
sick
man
with
signs
of
disgust
you
say
that
the
lieutenant
threatened
to
padre
damaso
that
yes
padre
broke
in
fray
sibyla
with
a
faint
smile
but
this
morning
i
saw
him
and
he
told
me
that
he
was
sorry
for
what
occurred
last
night
that
the
sherry
had
gone
to
his
head
and
that
he
believed
that
padre
damaso
was
in
the
same
condition
your
threat
i
asked
him
jokingly
he
answered
me
know
how
to
keep
my
word
when
my
honor
is
affected
but
i
am
not
nor
have
ever
been
an
informer
for
that
reason
i
wear
only
two
stars
after
they
had
conversed
a
while
longer
on
unimportant
subjects
fray
sibyla
took
his
departure
it
was
true
that
the
lieutenant
had
not
gone
to
the
palace
but
the
heard
what
had
occurred
while
talking
with
some
of
his
aides
about
the
allusions
that
the
manila
newspapers
were
making
to
him
under
the
names
of
comets
and
celestial
apparitions
one
of
them
told
him
about
the
affair
of
padre
damaso
with
a
somewhat
heightened
coloring
although
substantially
correct
as
to
matter
from
whom
did
you
learn
this
asked
his
excellency
smiling
from
laruja
who
was
telling
it
this
morning
in
the
office
the
again
smiled
and
said
a
woman
or
a
friar
insult
one
i
contemplate
living
in
peace
for
the
time
that
i
shall
remain
in
this
country
and
i
do
want
any
more
quarrels
with
men
who
wear
skirts
besides
i
learned
that
the
provincial
has
scoffed
at
my
orders
i
asked
for
the
removal
of
this
friar
as
a
punishment
and
they
transferred
him
to
a
better
town
tricks
as
we
say
in
spain
but
when
his
excellency
found
himself
alone
he
stopped
smiling
ah
if
this
people
were
not
so
stupid
i
would
put
a
curb
on
their
reverences
he
sighed
to
himself
but
every
people
deserves
its
fate
so
let
do
as
everybody
else
does
capitan
tiago
meanwhile
had
concluded
his
interview
with
padre
damaso
or
rather
to
speak
more
exactly
padre
damaso
had
concluded
with
him
so
now
you
are
warned
said
the
franciscan
on
leaving
all
this
could
have
been
avoided
if
you
had
consulted
me
beforehand
if
you
had
not
lied
when
i
asked
you
try
not
to
play
any
more
foolish
tricks
and
trust
your
protector
capitan
tiago
walked
up
and
down
the
sala
a
few
times
meditating
and
sighing
suddenly
as
if
a
happy
thought
had
occurred
to
him
he
ran
to
the
oratory
and
extinguished
the
candles
and
the
lamp
that
had
been
lighted
for
ibarra
safety
the
way
is
long
and
yet
time
he
muttered
chapter
x
the
town
almost
on
the
margin
of
the
lake
in
the
midst
of
meadows
and
lies
the
town
of
san
diego
from
it
sugar
rice
coffee
and
fruits
are
either
exported
or
sold
for
a
small
part
of
their
value
to
the
chinese
who
exploit
the
simplicity
and
vices
of
the
native
farmers
when
on
a
clear
day
the
boys
ascend
to
the
upper
part
of
the
church
tower
which
is
beautified
by
moss
and
creeping
plants
they
break
out
into
joyful
exclamations
at
the
beauty
of
the
scene
spread
out
before
them
in
the
midst
of
the
clustering
roofs
of
nipa
tiles
corrugated
iron
and
palm
leaves
separated
by
groves
and
gardens
each
one
is
able
to
discover
his
own
home
his
little
nest
everything
serves
as
a
mark
a
tree
that
tamarind
with
its
light
foliage
that
coco
palm
laden
with
nuts
like
the
astarte
genetrix
or
the
diana
of
ephesus
with
her
numerous
breasts
a
bending
bamboo
an
areca
palm
or
a
cross
yonder
is
the
river
a
huge
glassy
serpent
sleeping
on
a
green
carpet
with
rocks
scattered
here
and
there
along
its
sandy
channel
that
break
its
current
into
ripples
there
the
bed
is
narrowed
between
high
banks
to
which
the
gnarled
trees
cling
with
bared
roots
here
it
becomes
a
gentle
slope
where
the
stream
widens
and
eddies
about
farther
away
a
small
hut
built
on
the
edge
of
the
high
bank
seems
to
defy
the
winds
the
heights
and
the
depths
presenting
with
its
slender
posts
the
appearance
of
a
huge
bird
watching
for
a
reptile
to
seize
upon
trunks
of
palm
or
other
trees
with
their
bark
still
on
them
unite
the
banks
by
a
shaky
and
infirm
which
if
not
a
very
secure
crossing
is
nevertheless
a
wonderful
contrivance
for
gymnastic
exercises
in
preserving
one
balance
a
thing
not
to
be
despised
the
boys
bathing
in
the
river
are
amused
by
the
difficulties
of
the
old
woman
crossing
with
a
basket
on
her
head
or
by
the
antics
of
the
old
man
who
moves
tremblingly
and
loses
his
staff
in
the
water
but
that
which
always
attracts
particular
notice
is
what
might
be
called
a
peninsula
of
forest
in
the
sea
of
cultivated
fields
there
in
that
wood
are
trees
with
hollow
trunks
which
die
only
when
their
high
tops
are
struck
and
set
on
fire
by
the
lightning
and
it
is
said
that
the
fire
always
checks
itself
and
dies
out
in
the
same
spot
there
are
huge
points
of
rock
which
time
and
nature
are
clothing
with
velvet
garments
of
moss
layer
after
layer
of
dust
settles
in
the
hollows
the
rains
beat
it
down
and
the
birds
bring
seeds
the
tropical
vegetation
spreads
out
luxuriantly
in
thickets
and
underbrush
while
curtains
of
interwoven
vines
hang
from
the
branches
of
the
trees
and
twine
about
their
roots
or
spread
along
the
ground
as
if
flora
were
not
yet
satisfied
but
must
place
plant
above
plant
mosses
and
fungi
live
upon
the
cracked
trunks
and
orchids
graceful
guests
twine
in
loving
embrace
with
the
foliage
of
the
hospitable
trees
strange
legends
exist
concerning
this
wood
which
is
held
in
awe
by
the
country
folk
the
most
credible
account
and
therefore
the
one
least
known
and
believed
seems
to
be
this
when
the
town
was
still
a
collection
of
miserable
huts
with
the
grass
growing
abundantly
in
the
streets
at
the
time
when
the
wild
boar
and
deer
roamed
about
during
the
nights
there
arrived
in
the
place
one
day
an
old
spaniard
who
spoke
tagalog
rather
well
after
looking
about
and
inspecting
the
land
he
finally
inquired
for
the
owners
of
this
wood
in
which
there
were
hot
springs
some
persons
who
claimed
to
be
such
presented
themselves
and
the
old
man
acquired
it
in
exchange
for
clothes
jewels
and
a
sum
of
money
soon
afterward
he
disappeared
mysteriously
the
people
thought
that
he
had
been
spirited
away
when
a
bad
odor
from
the
neighboring
wood
attracted
the
attention
of
some
herdsmen
tracing
this
they
found
the
decaying
corpse
of
the
old
spaniard
hanging
from
the
branch
of
a
balete
tree
in
life
he
had
inspired
fear
by
his
deep
hollow
voice
his
sunken
eyes
and
his
mirthless
laugh
but
now
dead
by
his
own
act
he
disturbed
the
sleep
of
the
women
some
threw
the
jewels
into
the
river
and
burned
the
clothes
and
from
the
time
that
the
corpse
was
buried
at
the
foot
of
the
balete
itself
no
one
willingly
ventured
near
the
spot
a
belated
herdsman
looking
for
some
of
his
strayed
charges
told
of
lights
that
he
had
seen
there
and
when
some
venturesome
youths
went
to
the
place
they
heard
mournful
cries
to
win
the
smiles
of
his
disdainful
lady
a
forlorn
lover
agreed
to
spend
the
night
there
and
in
proof
to
wrap
around
the
trunk
a
long
piece
of
rattan
but
he
died
of
a
quick
fever
that
seized
him
the
very
next
day
stories
and
legends
still
cluster
about
the
place
a
few
months
after
the
finding
of
the
old
spaniard
body
there
appeared
a
youth
apparently
a
spanish
mestizo
who
said
that
he
was
the
son
of
the
deceased
he
established
himself
in
the
place
and
devoted
his
attention
to
agriculture
especially
the
raising
of
indigo
don
saturnino
was
a
silent
young
man
with
a
violent
disposition
even
cruel
at
times
yet
he
was
energetic
and
industrious
he
surrounded
the
grave
of
his
father
with
a
wall
but
visited
it
only
at
rare
intervals
when
he
was
along
in
years
he
married
a
young
woman
from
manila
and
she
became
the
mother
of
don
rafael
the
father
of
crisostomo
from
his
youth
don
rafael
was
a
favorite
with
the
country
people
the
agricultural
methods
introduced
and
encouraged
by
his
father
spread
rapidly
new
settlers
poured
in
the
chinese
came
and
the
settlement
became
a
village
with
a
native
priest
later
the
village
grew
into
a
town
the
priest
died
and
fray
damaso
came
all
this
time
the
tomb
and
the
land
around
it
remained
unmolested
sometimes
a
crowd
of
boys
armed
with
clubs
and
stones
would
become
bold
enough
to
wander
into
the
place
to
gather
guavas
papayas
lomboy
and
other
fruits
but
it
frequently
happened
that
when
their
sport
was
at
its
height
or
while
they
gazed
in
awed
silence
at
the
rotting
piece
of
rope
which
still
swung
from
the
branch
stones
would
fall
coming
from
they
knew
not
where
then
with
cries
of
the
old
man
the
old
man
they
would
throw
away
fruit
and
clubs
jump
from
the
trees
and
hurry
between
the
rocks
and
through
the
thickets
nor
would
they
stop
running
until
they
were
well
out
of
the
wood
some
pale
and
breathless
others
weeping
and
only
a
few
laughing
chapter
xi
the
rulers
divide
and
rule
new
who
were
the
caciques
of
the
town
don
rafael
when
alive
even
though
he
was
the
richest
owned
more
land
and
was
the
patron
of
nearly
everybody
had
not
been
one
of
them
as
he
was
modest
and
depreciated
the
value
of
his
own
deeds
no
faction
in
his
favor
had
ever
been
formed
in
the
town
and
we
have
already
seen
how
the
people
all
rose
up
against
him
when
they
saw
him
hesitate
upon
being
attacked
could
it
be
capitan
tiago
true
it
was
that
when
he
went
there
he
was
received
with
an
orchestra
by
his
debtors
who
banqueted
him
and
heaped
gifts
upon
him
the
finest
fruits
burdened
his
table
and
a
quarter
of
deer
or
wild
boar
was
his
share
of
the
hunt
if
he
found
the
horse
of
a
debtor
beautiful
half
an
hour
afterwards
it
was
in
his
stable
all
this
was
true
but
they
laughed
at
him
behind
his
back
and
in
secret
called
him
sacristan
tiago
perhaps
it
was
the
gobernadorcillo
no
for
he
was
only
an
unhappy
mortal
who
commanded
not
but
obeyed
who
ordered
not
but
was
ordered
who
drove
not
but
was
driven
nevertheless
he
had
to
answer
to
the
alcalde
for
having
commanded
ordered
and
driven
just
as
if
he
were
the
originator
of
everything
yet
be
it
said
to
his
credit
that
he
had
never
presumed
upon
or
usurped
such
honors
which
had
cost
him
five
thousand
pesos
and
many
humiliations
but
considering
the
income
it
brought
him
it
was
cheap
well
then
might
it
be
god
ah
the
good
god
disturbed
neither
the
consciences
nor
the
sleep
of
the
inhabitants
at
least
he
did
not
make
them
tremble
and
if
by
chance
he
might
have
been
mentioned
in
a
sermon
surely
they
would
have
sighed
longingly
oh
that
only
there
were
a
god
to
the
good
lord
they
paid
little
attention
as
the
saints
gave
them
enough
to
do
for
those
poor
folk
god
had
come
to
be
like
those
unfortunate
monarchs
who
are
surrounded
by
courtiers
to
whom
alone
the
people
render
homage
san
diego
was
a
kind
of
rome
not
the
rome
of
the
time
when
the
cunning
romulus
laid
out
its
walls
with
a
plow
nor
of
the
later
time
when
bathed
in
its
own
and
others
blood
it
dictated
laws
to
the
world
no
it
was
a
rome
of
our
own
times
with
the
difference
that
in
place
of
marble
monuments
and
colosseums
it
had
its
monuments
of
sawali
and
its
cockpit
of
nipa
the
curate
was
the
pope
in
the
vatican
the
alferez
of
the
civil
guard
the
king
of

on

all
it
must
be
understood
on
a
scale
of
nipa
and
bamboo
here
as
there
continual
quarreling
went
on
since
each
wished
to
be
the
master
and
considered
the
other
an
intruder
let
us
examine
the
characteristics
of
each
fray
bernardo
salvi
was
that
silent
young
franciscan
of
whom
we
have
spoken
before
in
his
habits
and
manners
he
was
quite
different
from
his
brethren
and
even
from
his
predecessor
the
violent
padre
damaso
he
was
thin
and
sickly
habitually
pensive
strict
in
the
fulfilment
of
his
religious
duties
and
careful
of
his
good
name
in
a
month
after
his
arrival
nearly
every
one
in
the
town
had
joined
the
venerable
tertiary
order
to
the
great
distress
of
its
rival
the
society
of
the
holy
rosary
his
soul
leaped
with
joy
to
see
about
each
neck
four
or
five
scapularies
and
around
each
waist
a
knotted
girdle
and
to
behold
the
procession
of
corpses
and
ghosts
in
habits
the
senior
sacristan
made
a
small
fortune
selling
or
giving
away
as
alms
we
should
say
all
things
necessary
for
the
salvation
of
the
soul
and
the
warfare
against
the
devil
as
it
is
well
known
that
this
spirit
which
formerly
had
the
temerity
to
contradict
god
himself
face
to
face
and
to
doubt
his
words
as
is
related
in
the
holy
book
of
job
who
carried
our
lord
christ
through
the
air
as
afterwards
in
the
dark
ages
he
carried
the
ghosts
and
continues
according
to
report
to
carry
the
of
the
philippines
now
seems
to
have
become
so
shamefaced
that
he
can
not
endure
the
sight
of
a
piece
of
painted
cloth
and
that
he
fears
the
knots
on
a
cord
but
all
this
proves
nothing
more
than
that
there
is
progress
on
this
side
also
and
that
the
devil
is
backward
or
at
least
a
conservative
as
are
all
who
dwell
in
darkness
otherwise
we
must
attribute
to
him
the
weakness
of
a
girl
as
we
have
said
fray
salvi
was
very
assiduous
in
the
fulfilment
of
his
duties
too
assiduous
the
alferez
thought
while
he
was
preaching
he
was
very
fond
of
preaching
the
doors
of
the
church
were
closed
wherein
he
was
like
nero
who
allowed
no
one
to
leave
the
theater
while
he
was
singing
but
the
former
did
it
for
the
salvation
and
the
latter
for
the
corruption
of
souls
fray
salvi
rarely
resorted
to
blows
but
was
accustomed
to
punish
every
shortcoming
of
his
subordinates
with
fines
in
this
respect
he
was
very
different
from
padre
damaso
who
had
been
accustomed
to
settle
everything
with
his
fists
or
a
cane
administering
such
chastisement
with
the
greatest
for
this
however
he
should
not
be
judged
too
harshly
as
he
was
firm
in
the
belief
that
the
indian
could
be
managed
only
by
beating
him
just
as
was
affirmed
by
a
friar
who
knew
enough
to
write
books
and
padre
damaso
never
disputed
anything
that
he
saw
in
print
a
credulity
of
which
many
might
have
reason
to
complain
although
fray
salvi
made
little
use
of
violence
yet
as
an
old
wiseacre
of
the
town
said
what
he
lacked
in
quantity
he
made
up
in
quality
but
this
should
not
be
counted
against
him
for
the
fasts
and
abstinences
thinned
his
blood
and
unstrung
his
nerves
and
as
the
people
said
the
wind
got
into
his
head
thus
it
came
about
that
it
was
not
possible
to
learn
from
the
condition
of
the
sacristans
backs
whether
the
curate
was
fasting
or
feasting
the
only
rival
of
this
spiritual
power
with
tendencies
toward
the
temporal
was
as
we
have
said
the
alferez
the
only
one
since
the
women
told
how
the
devil
himself
would
flee
from
the
curate
because
having
one
day
dared
to
tempt
him
he
was
caught
tied
to
a
bedpost
soundly
whipped
with
a
rope
and
set
at
liberty
only
after
nine
days
as
a
consequence
any
one
who
after
this
would
still
be
the
enemy
of
such
a
man
deserved
to
fall
into
worse
repute
than
even
the
weak
and
unwary
devils
but
the
alferez
deserved
his
fate
his
wife
was
an
old
filipina
of
abundant
rouge
and
paint
known
as
doña
consolacion
although
her
husband
and
some
others
called
her
by
quite
another
name
the
alferez
revenged
his
conjugal
misfortunes
on
his
own
person
by
getting
so
drunk
that
he
made
a
tank
of
himself
or
by
ordering
his
soldiers
to
drill
in
the
sun
while
he
remained
in
the
shade
or
more
frequently
by
beating
up
his
consort
who
if
she
was
not
a
lamb
of
god
to
take
away
one
sins
at
least
served
to
lay
up
for
her
spouse
many
torments
in
purgatory
if
perchance
he
should
get
there
a
matter
of
doubt
to
the
devout
women
as
if
for
the
fun
of
it
these
two
used
to
beat
each
other
up
beautifully
giving
free
shows
to
the
neighborhood
with
vocal
and
instrumental
accompaniments
soft
loud
with
pedal
and
all
whenever
these
scandals
reached
the
ears
of
padre
salvi
he
would
smile
cross
himself
and
recite
a
paternoster
they
called
him
a
grafter
a
hypocrite
a
carlist
and
a
miser
he
merely
smiled
and
recited
more
prayers
the
alferez
had
a
little
anecdote
which
he
always
related
to
the
occasional
spaniards
who
visited
him
are
you
going
over
to
the
convento
to
visit
the
sanctimonious
rascal
there
the
little
curate
yes
well
if
he
offers
you
chocolate
which
i
doubt
but
if
he
offers
it
remember
this
if
he
calls
to
the
servant
and
says
make
a
cup
of
chocolate
then
stay
without
fear
but
if
he
calls
out
make
a
cup
of
chocolate
then
take
your
hat
and
leave
on
a
run
what
the
startled
visitor
would
ask
does
he
poison
people
no
man
not
at
all
what
then
eh
means
thick
and
rich
while
means
watered
and
thin
but
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
this
was
a
slander
on
the
part
of
the
alferez
since
the
same
story
is
told
of
many
curates
at
least
it
may
be
a
thing
peculiar
to
the
order
to
make
trouble
for
the
curate
the
soldier
at
the
instigation
of
his
wife
would
prohibit
any
one
from
walking
abroad
after
nine
at
night
doña
consolacion
would
then
claim
that
she
had
seen
the
curate
disguised
in
a
piña
camisa
and
salakot
walking
about
late
fray
salvi
would
take
his
revenge
in
a
holy
manner
upon
seeing
the
alferez
enter
the
church
he
would
innocently
order
the
sacristan
to
close
all
the
doors
and
would
then
go
up
into
the
pulpit
and
preach
until
the
very
saints
closed
their
eyes
and
even
the
wooden
dove
above
his
head
the
image
of
the
holy
ghost
murmured
for
mercy
but
the
alferez
like
all
the
unregenerate
did
not
change
his
ways
for
this
he
would
go
away
cursing
and
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
catch
a
sacristan
or
one
of
the
curate
servants
he
would
arrest
him
give
him
a
beating
and
make
him
scrub
the
floor
of
the
barracks
and
that
of
his
own
house
which
at
such
times
was
put
in
a
decent
condition
on
going
to
pay
the
fine
imposed
by
the
curate
for
his
absence
the
sacristan
would
explain
the
cause
fray
salvi
would
listen
in
silence
take
the
money
and
at
once
turn
out
his
goats
and
sheep
so
that
they
might
graze
in
the
alferez
garden
while
he
himself
looked
up
a
new
text
for
another
longer
and
more
edifying
sermon
but
these
were
only
little
pleasantries
and
if
the
two
chanced
to
meet
they
would
shake
hands
and
converse
politely
when
her
husband
was
sleeping
off
the
wine
he
had
drunk
or
was
snoring
through
the
siesta
and
she
could
not
quarrel
with
him
doña
consolacion
in
a
blue
flannel
camisa
with
a
big
cigar
in
her
mouth
would
take
her
stand
at
the
window
she
could
not
endure
the
young
people
so
from
there
she
would
scrutinize
and
mock
the
passing
girls
who
being
afraid
of
her
would
hurry
by
in
confusion
holding
their
breath
the
while
and
not
daring
to
raise
their
eyes
one
great
virtue
doña
consolation
possessed
and
this
was
that
she
had
evidently
never
looked
in
a
mirror
these
were
the
rulers
of
the
town
of
san
diego
chapter
xii
all
saints
the
one
thing
perhaps
that
indisputably
distinguishes
man
from
the
brute
creation
is
the
attention
which
he
pays
to
those
who
have
passed
away
and
wonder
of
wonders
this
characteristic
seems
to
be
more
deeply
rooted
in
proportion
to
the
lack
of
civilization
historians
relate
that
the
ancient
inhabitants
of
the
philippines
venerated
and
deified
their
ancestors
but
now
the
contrary
is
true
and
the
dead
have
to
entrust
themselves
to
the
living
it
is
also
related
that
the
people
of
new
guinea
preserve
the
bones
of
their
dead
in
chests
and
maintain
communication
with
them
the
greater
part
of
the
peoples
of
asia
africa
and
america
offer
them
the
finest
products
of
their
kitchens
or
dishes
of
what
was
their
favorite
food
when
alive
and
give
banquets
at
which
they
believe
them
to
be
present
the
egyptians
raised
up
palaces
and
the
mussulmans
built
shrines
but
the
masters
in
these
things
those
who
have
most
clearly
read
the
human
heart
are
the
people
of
dahomey
these
negroes
know
that
man
is
revengeful
so
they
consider
that
nothing
will
more
content
the
dead
than
to
sacrifice
all
his
enemies
upon
his
grave
and
as
man
is
curious
and
may
not
know
how
to
entertain
himself
in
the
other
life
each
year
they
send
him
a
newsletter
under
the
skin
of
a
beheaded
slave
we
ourselves
differ
from
all
the
rest
in
spite
of
the
inscriptions
on
the
tombs
hardly
any
one
believes
that
the
dead
rest
and
much
less
that
they
rest
in
peace
the
most
optimistic
fancies
his
forefathers
still
roasting
in
purgatory
and
if
it
turns
out
that
he
himself
be
not
completely
damned
he
will
yet
be
able
to
associate
with
them
for
many
years
if
any
one
would
contradict
let
him
visit
the
churches
and
cemeteries
of
the
country
on
all
saints
day
and
he
will
be
convinced
now
that
we
are
in
san
diego
let
us
visit
its
cemetery
which
is
located
in
the
midst
of
there
toward
the
west
not
a
city
merely
a
village
of
the
dead
approached
by
a
path
dusty
in
dry
weather
and
navigable
on
rainy
days
a
wooden
gate
and
a
fence
half
of
stone
and
half
of
bamboo
stakes
appear
to
separate
it
from
the
abode
of
the
living
but
not
from
the
curate
goats
and
some
of
the
pigs
of
the
neighborhood
who
come
and
go
making
explorations
among
the
tombs
and
enlivening
the
solitude
with
their
presence
in
the
center
of
this
enclosure
rises
a
large
wooden
cross
set
on
a
stone
pedestal
the
storms
have
doubled
over
the
tin
plate
for
the
inscription
inri
and
the
rains
have
effaced
the
letters
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
as
on
the
real
golgotha
is
a
confused
heap
of
skulls
and
bones
which
the
indifferent
has
thrown
from
the
graves
he
digs
and
there
they
will
probably
await
not
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
but
the
coming
of
the
animals
to
defile
them
round
about
may
be
noted
signs
of
recent
excavations
here
the
earth
is
sunken
there
it
forms
a
low
mound
there
grow
in
all
their
luxuriance
the
to
prick
the
feet
with
its
spiny
berries
and
the
to
add
its
odor
to
that
of
the
cemetery
as
if
the
place
did
not
have
smells
enough
already
yet
the
ground
is
sprinkled
with
a
few
little
flowers
which
like
those
skulls
are
known
only
to
their
creator
their
petals
wear
a
pale
smile
and
their
fragrance
is
the
fragrance
of
the
tombs
the
grass
and
creepers
fill
up
the
corners
or
climb
over
the
walls
and
niches
to
cover
and
beautify
the
naked
ugliness
and
in
places
even
penetrate
into
the
fissures
made
by
the
earthquakes
so
as
to
hide
from
sight
the
revered
hollowness
of
the
sepulcher
at
the
time
we
enter
the
people
have
driven
the
animals
away
with
the
single
exception
of
some
old
hog
an
animal
that
is
hard
to
convince
who
shows
his
small
eyes
and
pulling
back
his
head
from
a
great
gap
in
the
fence
sticks
up
his
snout
and
seems
to
say
to
a
woman
praying
near
do
eat
it
all
leave
something
for
me
wo
you
two
men
are
digging
a
grave
near
one
of
the
tottering
walls
one
of
them
the
works
with
indifference
throwing
about
bones
as
a
gardener
does
stones
and
dry
branches
while
the
other
more
intent
on
his
work
is
perspiring
smoking
and
spitting
at
every
moment
listen
says
the
latter
in
tagalog
would
it
be
better
for
us
to
dig
in
some
other
place
this
is
too
recent
one
grave
is
as
recent
as
another
i
ca
stand
it
any
longer
that
bone
you
just
cut
in
two
has
blood
oozing
from
it
and
those
hairs
but
how
sensitive
you
are
was
the
other
reproach
just
as
if
you
were
a
town
clerk
if
like
myself
you
had
dug
up
a
corpse
of
twenty
days
on
a
dark
and
rainy
night
my
lantern
went
out
his
companion
shuddered
the
coffin
burst
open
the
corpse
fell
out
it
stunk
and
supposing
you
had
to
carry
it
the
rain
wet
us
both
ugh
and
why
did
you
dig
it
up
the
looked
at
him
in
surprise
why
how
do
i
know
i
was
ordered
to
do
so
who
ordered
you
the
stepped
backward
and
looked
his
companion
over
from
head
to
foot
man
you
like
a
spaniard
for
afterwards
a
spaniard
asked
me
the
same
questions
but
in
secret
so
i
going
to
answer
you
as
i
answered
the
spaniard
the
fat
curate
ordered
me
to
do
so
ah
and
what
did
you
do
with
the
corpse
afterwards
further
questioned
the
sensitive
one
the
devil
if
i
did
know
you
and
was
not
sure
that
you
are
a
i
would
say
that
you
were
certainly
a
spaniard
of
the
civil
guard
since
you
ask
questions
just
as
he
did
well
the
fat
curate
ordered
me
to
bury
it
in
the
chinamen
cemetery
but
the
coffin
was
heavy
and
the
chinese
cemetery
far
away
no
no
i
not
going
to
dig
any
more
the
other
interrupted
in
horror
as
he
threw
away
his
spade
and
jumped
out
of
the
hole
i
cut
a
skull
in
two
and
i
afraid
that
it
wo
let
me
sleep
tonight
the
old
laughed
to
see
how
the
fellow
left
crossing
himself
the
cemetery
was
filling
up
with
men
and
women
dressed
in
mourning
some
sought
a
grave
for
a
time
disputing
among
themselves
the
while
and
as
if
they
were
unable
to
agree
they
scattered
about
each
kneeling
where
he
thought
best
others
who
had
niches
for
their
deceased
relatives
lighted
candles
and
fell
to
praying
devoutly
exaggerated
or
suppressed
sighs
and
sobs
were
heard
amid
the
hum
of
prayers
orapreiss
that
arose
from
all
sides
a
little
old
man
with
bright
eyes
entered
bareheaded
upon
seeing
him
many
laughed
and
some
women
knitted
their
eyebrows
the
old
man
did
not
seem
to
pay
any
attention
to
these
demonstrations
as
he
went
toward
a
pile
of
skulls
and
knelt
to
look
earnestly
for
something
among
the
bones
then
he
carefully
removed
the
skulls
one
by
one
but
apparently
without
finding
what
he
sought
for
he
wrinkled
his
brow
nodded
his
head
from
side
to
side
looked
all
about
him
and
finally
rose
and
approached
the
who
raised
his
head
when
the
old
man
spoke
to
him
do
you
know
where
there
is
a
beautiful
skull
white
as
the
meat
of
a
coconut
with
a
complete
set
of
teeth
which
i
had
there
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
under
those
leaves
the
shrugged
his
shoulders
look
added
the
old
man
showing
a
silver
coin
i
have
only
this
but
i
give
it
to
you
if
you
find
the
skull
for
me
the
gleam
of
the
silver
caused
the
to
consider
and
staring
toward
the
heap
of
bones
he
said
is
it
there
no
then
i
do
know
where
it
is
do
you
know
when
those
who
owe
me
pay
me
i
give
you
more
continued
the
old
man
it
was
the
skull
of
my
wife
so
if
you
find
it
for
me
is
it
there
then
i
do
know
but
if
you
wish
i
can
give
you
another
you
like
the
grave
you
digging
apostrophized
the
old
man
nervously
you
do
know
the
value
of
what
you
lose
for
whom
is
that
grave
how
should
i
know
replied
the
other
in
bad
humor
for
a
corpse
like
the
grave
like
the
grave
repeated
the
old
man
with
a
dry
smile
you
do
know
what
you
throw
away
nor
what
you
receive
dig
dig
on
and
he
turned
away
in
the
direction
of
the
gate
meanwhile
the
had
completed
his
task
attested
by
the
two
mounds
of
fresh
red
earth
at
the
sides
of
the
grave
he
took
some
buyo
from
his
salakot
and
began
to
chew
it
while
he
stared
stupidly
at
what
was
going
on
around
him
chapter
xiii
signs
of
storm
as
the
old
man
was
leaving
the
cemetery
there
stopped
at
the
head
of
the
path
a
carriage
which
from
its
appearance
and
sweating
horses
seemed
to
have
come
from
a
great
distance
followed
by
an
aged
servant
ibarra
left
the
carriage
and
dismissed
it
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
then
gravely
and
silently
turned
toward
the
cemetery
my
illness
and
my
duties
have
not
permitted
me
to
return
said
the
old
servant
timidly
capitan
tiago
promised
that
he
would
see
that
a
niche
was
constructed
but
i
planted
some
flowers
on
the
grave
and
set
up
a
cross
carved
by
my
own
hands
ibarra
made
no
reply
there
behind
that
big
cross
sir
he
added
when
they
were
well
inside
the
gate
as
he
pointed
to
the
place
ibarra
was
so
intent
upon
his
quest
that
he
did
not
notice
the
movement
of
surprise
on
the
part
of
the
persons
who
recognized
him
and
suspended
their
prayers
to
watch
him
curiously
he
walked
along
carefully
to
avoid
stepping
on
any
of
the
graves
which
were
easily
distinguishable
by
the
hollow
places
in
the
soil
in
other
times
he
had
walked
on
them
carelessly
but
now
they
were
to
be
respected
his
father
lay
among
them
when
he
reached
the
large
cross
he
stopped
and
looked
all
around
his
companion
stood
confused
and
confounded
seeking
some
mark
in
the
ground
but
nowhere
was
any
cross
to
be
seen
was
it
here
he
murmured
through
his
teeth
no
there
but
the
ground
has
been
disturbed
ibarra
gave
him
a
look
of
anguish
yes
he
went
on
i
remember
that
there
was
a
stone
near
it
the
grave
was
rather
short
the
was
sick
so
a
farmer
had
to
dig
it
but
let
ask
that
man
what
has
become
of
the
cross
they
went
over
to
where
the
was
watching
them
with
curiosity
he
removed
his
salakot
respectfully
as
they
approached
can
you
tell
me
which
is
the
grave
there
that
had
a
cross
over
it
asked
the
servant
the
looked
toward
the
place
and
reflected
a
big
cross
yes
a
big
one
affirmed
the
servant
eagerly
with
a
significant
look
at
ibarra
whose
face
lighted
up
a
carved
cross
tied
up
with
rattan
continued
the
that
it
that
it
like
this
exclaimed
the
servant
in
answer
as
he
drew
on
the
ground
the
figure
of
a
byzantine
cross
were
there
flowers
scattered
on
the
grave
oleanders
and
tuberoses
and
yes
the
servant
added
joyfully
offering
the
a
cigar
tell
us
which
is
the
grave
and
where
the
cross
is
the
scratched
his
ear
and
answered
with
a
yawn
well
as
for
the
cross
i
burned
it
burned
it
why
did
you
burn
it
because
the
fat
curate
ordered
me
to
do
so
who
is
the
fat
curate
asked
ibarra
who
why
the
one
that
beats
people
with
a
big
cane
ibarra
drew
his
hand
across
his
forehead
but
at
least
you
can
tell
us
where
the
grave
is
you
must
remember
that
the
smiled
as
he
answered
quietly
but
the
corpse
is
no
longer
there
what
that
you
saying
yes
continued
the
in
a
tone
i
buried
a
woman
in
that
place
a
week
ago
are
you
crazy
cried
the
servant
it
has
been
a
year
since
we
buried
him
that
very
true
but
a
good
many
months
ago
i
dug
the
body
up
the
fat
curate
ordered
me
to
do
so
and
to
take
it
to
the
cemetery
of
the
chinamen
but
as
it
was
heavy
and
there
was
rain
that
night
he
was
stopped
by
the
threatening
attitude
of
ibarra
who
had
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
was
shaking
him
did
you
do
that
demanded
the
youth
in
an
indescribable
tone
do
be
angry
sir
stammered
the
pale
and
trembling
i
did
bury
him
among
the
chinamen
better
be
drowned
than
lie
among
chinamen
i
said
to
myself
so
i
threw
the
body
into
the
lake
ibarra
placed
both
his
hands
on
the
shoulders
and
stared
at
him
for
a
long
time
with
an
indefinable
expression
then
with
the
ejaculation
you
are
only
a
miserable
slave
he
turned
away
hurriedly
stepping
upon
bones
graves
and
crosses
like
one
beside
himself
the
patted
his
arm
and
muttered
all
the
trouble
dead
men
cause
the
fat
padre
caned
me
for
allowing
it
to
be
buried
while
i
was
sick
and
this
fellow
almost
tore
my
arm
off
for
having
dug
it
up
that
what
these
spaniards
are
i
lose
my
job
yet
ibarra
walked
rapidly
with
a
look
in
his
eyes
while
the
aged
servant
followed
him
weeping
the
sun
was
setting
and
over
the
eastern
sky
was
flung
a
heavy
curtain
of
clouds
a
dry
wind
shook
the
and
made
the
bamboo
clumps
creak
ibarra
went
bareheaded
but
no
tear
wet
his
eyes
nor
did
any
sigh
escape
from
his
breast
he
moved
as
if
fleeing
from
something
perhaps
the
shade
of
his
father
perhaps
the
approaching
storm
he
crossed
through
the
town
to
the
outskirts
on
the
opposite
side
and
turned
toward
the
old
house
which
he
had
not
entered
for
so
many
years
surrounded
by
a
wall
it
seemed
to
beckon
to
him
with
its
open
windows
while
the
waved
its
branches
joyfully
and
the
doves
circled
about
the
conical
roof
of
their
cote
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
but
the
youth
gave
no
heed
to
these
signs
of
welcome
back
to
his
old
home
his
eyes
being
fixed
on
the
figure
of
a
priest
approaching
from
the
opposite
direction
it
was
the
curate
of
san
diego
the
pensive
franciscan
whom
we
have
seen
before
the
rival
of
the
alferez
the
breeze
folded
back
the
brim
of
his
wide
hat
and
blew
his
habit
closely
about
him
revealing
the
outlines
of
his
body
and
his
thin
curved
thighs
in
his
right
hand
he
carried
an
cane
this
was
the
first
time
that
he
and
ibarra
had
met
when
they
drew
near
each
other
ibarra
stopped
and
gazed
at
him
from
head
to
foot
fray
salvi
avoided
the
look
and
tried
to
appear
unconcerned
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
ibarra
went
up
to
him
quickly
and
dropping
a
heavy
hand
on
his
shoulder
asked
in
a
husky
voice
what
did
you
do
with
my
father
fray
salvi
pale
and
trembling
as
he
read
the
deep
feelings
that
flushed
the
youth
face
could
not
answer
he
seemed
paralyzed
what
did
you
do
with
my
father
again
demanded
the
youth
in
a
choking
voice
the
priest
who
was
gradually
being
forced
to
his
knees
by
the
heavy
hand
that
pressed
upon
his
shoulder
made
a
great
effort
and
answered
you
are
mistaken
i
did
nothing
to
your
father
you
did
went
on
the
youth
forcing
him
down
upon
his
knees
no
i
assure
you
it
was
my
predecessor
it
was
padre
damaso
ah
exclaimed
the
youth
releasing
his
hold
and
clapping
his
hand
desperately
to
his
brow
then
leaving
poor
fray
salvi
he
turned
away
and
hurried
toward
his
house
the
old
servant
came
up
and
helped
the
friar
to
his
feet
chapter
xiv
tasio
lunatic
or
sage
the
peculiar
old
man
wandered
about
the
streets
aimlessly
a
former
student
of
philosophy
he
had
given
up
his
career
in
obedience
to
his
mother
wishes
and
not
from
any
lack
of
means
or
ability
quite
the
contrary
it
was
because
his
mother
was
rich
and
he
was
said
to
possess
talent
the
good
woman
feared
that
her
son
would
become
learned
and
forget
god
so
she
had
given
him
his
choice
of
entering
the
priesthood
or
leaving
college
being
in
love
he
chose
the
latter
course
and
married
then
having
lost
both
his
wife
and
his
mother
within
a
year
he
sought
consolation
in
his
books
in
order
to
free
himself
from
sorrow
the
cockpit
and
the
dangers
of
idleness
he
became
so
addicted
to
his
studies
and
the
purchase
of
books
that
he
entirely
neglected
his
fortune
and
gradually
ruined
himself
persons
of
culture
called
him
don
anastasio
or
tasio
the
sage
while
the
great
crowd
of
the
ignorant
knew
him
as
tasio
the
lunatic
on
account
of
his
peculiar
ideas
and
his
eccentric
manner
of
dealing
with
others
as
we
said
before
the
evening
threatened
to
be
stormy
the
lightning
flashed
its
pale
rays
across
the
leaden
sky
the
air
was
heavy
and
the
slight
breeze
excessively
sultry
tasio
had
apparently
already
forgotten
his
beloved
skull
and
now
he
was
smiling
as
he
looked
at
the
dark
clouds
near
the
church
he
met
a
man
wearing
an
alpaca
coat
who
carried
in
one
hand
a
large
bundle
of
candles
and
in
the
other
a
tasseled
cane
the
emblem
of
his
office
as
gobernadorcillo
you
seem
to
be
merry
he
greeted
tasio
in
tagalog
truly
i
am
señor
capitan
i
merry
because
i
hope
for
something
ah
what
do
you
hope
for
the
storm
the
storm
are
you
thinking
of
taking
a
bath
asked
the
gobernadorcillo
in
a
jesting
way
as
he
stared
at
the
simple
attire
of
the
old
man
a
bath
that
not
a
bad
idea
especially
when
one
has
just
stumbled
over
some
trash
answered
tasio
in
a
similar
though
somewhat
more
offensive
tone
staring
at
the
other
face
but
i
hope
for
something
better
what
then
some
thunderbolts
that
will
kill
people
and
burn
down
houses
returned
the
sage
seriously
why
do
you
ask
for
the
deluge
at
once
we
all
deserve
it
even
you
and
i
you
señor
gobernadorcillo
have
there
a
bundle
of
tapers
that
came
from
some
chinese
shop
yet
this
now
makes
the
tenth
year
that
i
have
been
proposing
to
each
new
occupant
of
your
office
the
purchase
of
every
one
laughs
at
me
and
buys
bombs
and
rockets
and
pays
for
the
ringing
of
bells
even
you
yourself
on
the
day
after
i
made
my
proposition
ordered
from
the
chinese
founders
a
bell
in
honor
of
barbara
when
science
has
shown
that
it
is
dangerous
to
ring
the
bells
during
a
storm
explain
to
me
why
in
the
year
when
lightning
struck
in
biñan
it
hit
the
very
church
tower
and
destroyed
the
clock
and
altar
what
was
the
bell
of
barbara
doing
then
at
the
moment
there
was
a
vivid
flash
maría
y
josé
holy
st
barbara
exclaimed
the
gobernadorcillo
turning
pale
and
crossing
himself
tasio
burst
out
into
a
loud
laugh
you
are
worthy
of
your
patroness
he
remarked
dryly
in
spanish
as
he
turned
his
back
and
went
toward
the
church
inside
the
sacristans
were
preparing
a
catafalque
bordered
with
candles
placed
in
wooden
sockets
two
large
tables
had
been
placed
one
above
the
other
and
covered
with
black
cloth
across
which
ran
white
stripes
with
here
and
there
a
skull
painted
on
it
is
that
for
the
souls
or
for
the
candles
inquired
the
old
man
but
noticing
two
boys
one
about
ten
and
the
other
seven
he
turned
to
them
without
awaiting
an
answer
from
the
sacristans
wo
you
come
with
me
boys
he
asked
them
your
mother
has
prepared
a
supper
for
you
fit
for
a
curate
the
senior
sacristan
will
not
let
us
leave
until
eight
sir
answered
the
larger
of
the
two
boys
i
expect
to
get
my
pay
to
give
it
to
our
mother
ah
and
where
are
you
going
now
to
the
belfry
sir
to
ring
the
knell
for
the
souls
going
to
the
belfry
then
take
care
do
go
near
the
bells
during
the
storm
tasio
then
left
the
church
not
without
first
bestowing
a
look
of
pity
on
the
two
boys
who
were
climbing
the
stairway
into
the
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
looked
at
the
sky
again
and
murmured
now
i
should
be
sorry
if
thunderbolts
should
fall
with
his
head
bowed
in
thought
he
started
toward
the
outskirts
of
the
town
wo
you
come
in
invited
a
voice
in
spanish
from
a
window
the
sage
raised
his
head
and
saw
a
man
of
thirty
or
years
of
age
smiling
at
him
what
are
you
reading
there
asked
tasio
pointing
to
a
book
the
man
held
in
his
hand
a
work
just
published
torments
suffered
by
the
blessed
souls
in
purgatory
the
other
answered
with
a
smile
man
man
man
exclaimed
the
sage
in
an
altered
tone
as
he
entered
the
house
the
author
must
be
a
very
clever
person
upon
reaching
the
top
of
the
stairway
he
was
cordially
received
by
the
master
of
the
house
don
filipo
lino
and
his
young
wife
doña
teodora
viña
don
filipo
was
the
of
the
town
and
leader
of
one
of
the
parties
the
liberal
faction
if
it
be
possible
to
speak
so
and
if
there
exist
parties
in
the
towns
of
the
philippines
did
you
meet
in
the
cemetery
the
son
of
the
deceased
don
rafael
who
has
just
returned
from
europe
yes
i
saw
him
as
he
alighted
from
his
carriage
they
say
that
he
went
to
look
for
his
father
grave
it
must
have
been
a
terrible
blow
the
sage
shrugged
his
shoulders
does
such
a
misfortune
affect
you
asked
the
young
wife
you
know
very
well
that
i
was
one
of
the
six
who
accompanied
the
body
and
it
was
i
who
appealed
to
the
when
i
saw
that
no
one
not
even
the
authorities
said
anything
about
such
an
outrage
although
i
always
prefer
to
honor
a
good
man
in
life
rather
than
to
worship
him
after
his
death
well
but
madam
i
am
not
a
believer
in
hereditary
monarchy
by
reason
of
the
chinese
blood
which
i
have
received
from
my
mother
i
believe
a
little
like
the
chinese
i
honor
the
father
on
account
of
the
son
and
not
the
son
on
account
of
the
father
i
believe
that
each
one
should
receive
the
reward
or
punishment
for
his
own
deeds
not
for
those
of
another
did
you
order
a
mass
said
for
your
dead
wife
as
i
advised
you
yesterday
asked
the
young
woman
changing
the
subject
of
conversation
no
answered
the
old
man
with
a
smile
what
a
pity
she
exclaimed
with
unfeigned
regret
they
say
that
until
ten
tomorrow
the
souls
will
wander
at
liberty
awaiting
the
prayers
of
the
living
and
that
during
these
days
one
mass
is
equivalent
to
five
on
other
days
of
the
year
or
even
to
six
as
the
curate
said
this
morning
what
does
that
mean
that
we
have
a
period
without
paying
which
we
should
take
advantage
of
but
doray
interrupted
don
filipo
you
know
that
don
anastasio
does
believe
in
purgatory
i
do
believe
in
purgatory
protested
the
old
man
partly
rising
from
his
seat
even
when
i
know
something
of
its
history
the
history
of
purgatory
exclaimed
the
couple
full
of
surprise
come
relate
it
to
us
you
do
know
it
and
yet
you
order
masses
and
talk
about
its
torments
well
as
it
has
begun
to
rain
and
threatens
to
continue
we
shall
have
time
to
relieve
the
monotony
replied
tasio
falling
into
a
thoughtful
mood
don
filipo
closed
the
book
which
he
held
in
his
hand
and
doray
sat
down
at
his
side
determined
not
to
believe
anything
that
the
old
man
was
about
to
say
the
latter
began
in
the
following
manner
purgatory
existed
long
before
our
lord
came
into
the
world
and
must
have
been
located
in
the
center
of
the
earth
according
to
padre
astete
or
somewhere
near
cluny
according
to
the
monk
of
whom
padre
girard
tells
us
but
the
location
is
of
least
importance
here
now
then
who
were
scorching
in
those
fires
that
had
been
burning
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
its
very
ancient
existence
is
proved
by
christian
philosophy
which
teaches
that
god
has
created
nothing
new
since
he
rested
but
it
could
have
existed
and
not
observed
don
filipo
very
well
but
yet
i
must
answer
that
some
knew
of
it
and
as
existing
one
of
these
was
zarathustra
or
zoroaster
who
wrote
part
of
the
and
founded
a
religion
which
in
some
points
resembles
ours
and
zarathustra
according
to
the
scholars
flourished
at
least
eight
hundred
years
before
christ
i
say
least
since
gaffarel
after
examining
the
testimony
of
plato
xanthus
of
lydia
pliny
hermippus
and
eudoxus
believes
it
to
have
been
two
thousand
five
hundred
years
before
our
era
however
that
may
be
it
is
certain
that
zarathustra
talked
of
a
kind
of
purgatory
and
showed
ways
of
getting
free
from
it
the
living
could
redeem
the
souls
of
those
who
died
in
sin
by
reciting
passages
from
the
avesta
and
by
doing
good
works
but
under
the
condition
that
the
person
offering
the
petitions
should
be
a
relative
up
to
the
fourth
generation
the
time
for
this
occurred
every
year
and
lasted
five
days
later
when
this
belief
had
become
fixed
among
the
people
the
priests
of
that
religion
saw
in
it
a
chance
of
profit
and
so
they
exploited
deep
and
dark
prison
where
remorse
reigns
as
zarathustra
called
it
they
declared
that
by
the
payment
of
a
small
coin
it
was
possible
to
save
a
soul
from
a
year
of
torture
but
as
in
that
religion
there
were
sins
punishable
by
three
hundred
to
a
thousand
years
of
suffering
such
as
lying
faithlessness
failure
to
keep
one
word
and
so
on
it
resulted
that
the
rascals
took
in
countless
sums
here
you
will
observe
something
like
our
purgatory
if
you
take
into
account
the
differences
in
the
religions
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
followed
by
rolling
thunder
caused
doray
to
start
up
and
exclaim
as
she
crossed
herself
maría
y
josé
i
going
to
leave
you
i
going
to
burn
some
sacred
palm
and
light
candles
of
penitence
the
rain
began
to
fall
in
torrents
the
sage
tasio
watching
the
young
woman
leave
continued
now
that
she
is
not
here
we
can
consider
this
matter
more
rationally
doray
even
though
a
little
superstitious
is
a
good
catholic
and
i
do
care
to
root
out
the
faith
from
her
heart
a
pure
and
simple
faith
is
as
distinct
from
fanaticism
as
the
flame
from
smoke
or
music
from
discords
only
the
fools
and
the
deaf
confuse
them
between
ourselves
we
can
say
that
the
idea
of
purgatory
is
good
holy
and
rational
it
perpetuates
the
union
of
those
who
were
and
those
who
are
leading
thus
to
greater
purity
of
life
the
evil
is
in
its
abuse
but
let
us
now
see
where
catholicism
got
this
idea
which
does
not
exist
in
the
old
testament
nor
in
the
gospels
neither
moses
nor
christ
made
the
slightest
mention
of
it
and
the
single
passage
which
is
cited
from
maccabees
is
insufficient
besides
this
book
was
declared
apocryphal
by
the
council
of
laodicea
and
the
holy
catholic
church
accepted
it
only
later
neither
have
the
pagan
religions
anything
like
it
the
passage
in
virgil
panduntur
which
probably
gave
occasion
for
gregory
the
great
to
speak
of
drowned
souls
and
to
dante
for
another
narrative
in
his
can
not
have
been
the
origin
of
this
belief
neither
the
brahmins
the
buddhists
nor
the
egyptians
who
may
have
given
rome
her
charon
and
her
avernus
had
anything
like
this
idea
i
wo
speak
now
of
the
religions
of
northern
europe
for
they
were
religions
of
warriors
bards
and
hunters
and
not
of
philosophers
while
they
yet
preserve
their
beliefs
and
even
their
rites
under
christian
forms
they
were
unable
to
accompany
the
hordes
in
the
spoliation
of
rome
or
to
seat
themselves
on
the
capitoline
the
religions
of
the
mists
were
dissipated
by
the
southern
sun
now
then
the
early
christians
did
not
believe
in
a
purgatory
but
died
in
the
blissful
confidence
of
shortly
seeing
god
face
to
face
apparently
the
first
fathers
of
the
church
who
mentioned
it
were
clement
of
alexandria
origen
and
irenaeus
who
were
all
perhaps
influenced
by
religion
which
still
flourished
and
was
widely
spread
throughout
the
east
since
at
every
step
we
read
reproaches
against
orientalism
irenaeus
proved
its
existence
by
the
fact
that
christ
remained
days
in
the
depths
of
the
earth
three
days
of
purgatory
and
deduced
from
this
that
every
soul
must
remain
there
until
the
resurrection
of
the
body
although
the
mecum
eris
in
seems
to
contradict
it
augustine
also
speaks
of
purgatory
and
if
not
affirming
its
existence
yet
he
did
not
believe
it
impossible
conjecturing
that
in
another
existence
there
might
continue
the
punishments
that
we
receive
in
this
life
for
our
sins
the
devil
with
st
augustine
ejaculated
don
filipo
he
satisfied
with
what
we
suffer
here
but
wished
a
continuance
well
so
it
went
some
believed
it
and
others
did
although
gregory
finally
came
to
admit
it
in
his
quibusdam
levibus
culpis
esse
ante
judicium
purgatorius
ignis
credendus
yet
nothing
definite
was
done
until
the
year
that
is
eight
centuries
later
when
the
council
of
florence
declared
that
there
must
exist
a
purifying
fire
for
the
souls
of
those
who
have
died
in
the
love
of
god
but
without
having
satisfied
divine
justice
lastly
the
council
of
trent
under
pius
iv
in
in
the
session
issued
the
purgatorial
decree
beginning
catholica
ecclesia
spiritu
santo
wherein
it
deduces
that
after
the
office
of
the
mass
the
petitions
of
the
living
their
prayers
alms
and
other
pious
works
are
the
surest
means
of
freeing
the
souls
nevertheless
the
protestants
do
not
believe
in
it
nor
do
the
greek
fathers
since
they
reject
any
biblical
authority
for
it
and
say
that
our
responsibility
ends
with
death
and
that
the
ligaberis
in
does
not
mean
ad
purgatorium
but
to
this
the
answer
can
be
made
that
since
purgatory
is
located
in
the
center
of
the
earth
it
fell
naturally
under
the
control
of
peter
but
i
should
never
get
through
if
i
had
to
relate
all
that
has
been
said
on
the
subject
any
day
that
you
wish
to
discuss
the
matter
with
me
come
to
my
house
and
there
we
will
consult
the
books
and
talk
freely
and
quietly
now
i
must
go
i
do
understand
why
christian
piety
permits
robbery
on
this
night
and
you
the
authorities
allow
it
and
i
fear
for
my
books
if
they
should
steal
them
to
read
i
would
object
but
i
know
that
there
are
many
who
wish
to
burn
them
in
order
to
do
for
me
an
act
of
charity
and
such
charity
worthy
of
the
caliph
omar
is
to
be
dreaded
some
believe
that
on
account
of
those
books
i
am
already
damned
but
i
suppose
that
you
do
believe
in
damnation
asked
doray
with
a
smile
as
she
appeared
carrying
in
a
brazier
the
dry
palm
leaves
which
gave
off
a
peculiar
smoke
and
an
agreeable
odor
i
do
know
madam
what
god
will
do
with
me
replied
the
old
man
thoughtfully
when
i
die
i
will
commit
myself
to
him
without
fear
and
he
may
do
with
me
what
he
wishes
but
a
thought
strikes
me
what
thought
is
that
if
the
only
ones
who
can
be
saved
are
the
catholics
and
of
them
only
five
per
cent
as
many
curates
say
and
as
the
catholics
form
only
a
twelfth
part
of
the
population
of
the
world
if
we
believe
what
statistics
show
it
would
result
that
after
damning
millions
and
millions
of
men
during
the
countless
ages
that
passed
before
the
saviour
came
to
the
earth
after
a
son
of
god
has
died
for
us
it
is
now
possible
to
save
only
five
in
every
twelve
hundred
that
can
not
be
so
i
prefer
to
believe
and
say
with
job
thou
break
a
leaf
driven
to
and
fro
and
wilt
thou
pursue
the
dry
stubble
no
such
a
calamity
is
impossible
and
to
believe
it
is
blasphemy
what
do
you
wish
divine
justice
divine
purity
oh
but
divine
justice
and
divine
purity
saw
the
future
before
the
creation
answered
the
old
man
as
he
rose
shuddering
man
is
an
accidental
and
not
a
necessary
part
of
creation
and
that
god
can
not
have
created
him
no
indeed
only
to
make
a
few
happy
and
condemn
hundreds
to
eternal
misery
and
all
in
a
moment
for
hereditary
faults
no
if
that
be
true
strangle
your
baby
son
sleeping
there
if
such
a
belief
were
not
a
blasphemy
against
that
god
who
must
be
the
highest
good
then
the
phenician
moloch
which
was
appeased
with
human
sacrifices
and
innocent
blood
and
in
whose
belly
were
burned
the
babes
torn
from
their
mothers
breasts
that
bloody
deity
that
horrible
divinity
would
be
by
the
side
of
him
a
weak
girl
a
friend
a
mother
of
humanity
horrified
the
lunatic
or
the
sage
left
the
house
and
ran
along
the
street
in
spite
of
the
rain
and
the
darkness
a
lurid
flash
followed
by
frightful
thunder
and
filling
the
air
with
deadly
currents
lighted
the
old
man
as
he
stretched
his
hand
toward
the
sky
and
cried
out
thou
protestest
i
know
that
thou
art
not
cruel
i
know
that
i
must
only
name
thee

the
flashes
of

became
more

the
storm
increased
in
violence
chapter
xv
the
sacristans
the
thunder
resounded
roar
following
close
upon
roar
each
by
a
blinding
flash
of
zigzag
lightning
so
that
it
might
have
been
said
that
god
was
writing
his
name
in
fire
and
that
the
eternal
arch
of
heaven
was
trembling
with
fear
the
rain
whipped
about
in
a
different
direction
each
moment
by
the
mournfully
whistling
wind
fell
in
torrents
with
a
voice
full
of
fear
the
bells
sounded
their
sad
supplication
and
in
the
brief
pauses
between
the
roars
of
the
unchained
elements
tolled
forth
sorrowful
peals
like
plaintive
groans
on
the
second
floor
of
the
church
tower
were
the
two
boys
whom
we
saw
talking
to
the
sage
the
younger
a
child
of
seven
years
with
large
black
eyes
and
a
timid
countenance
was
huddling
close
to
his
brother
a
boy
of
ten
whom
he
greatly
resembled
in
features
except
that
the
look
on
the
elder
face
was
deeper
and
firmer
both
were
meanly
dressed
in
clothes
full
of
rents
and
patches
they
sat
upon
a
block
of
wood
each
holding
the
end
of
a
rope
which
extended
upward
and
was
lost
amid
the
shadows
above
the
rain
reached
them
and
snuffed
the
piece
of
candle
burning
dimly
on
the
large
round
stone
that
was
used
to
furnish
the
thunder
on
good
friday
by
being
rolled
around
the
gallery
pull
on
the
rope
crispin
pull
cried
the
elder
to
his
little
brother
who
did
as
he
was
told
so
that
from
above
was
heard
a
faint
peal
instantly
drowned
out
by
the
reechoing
thunder
oh
if
we
were
only
at
home
now
with
mother
sighed
the
younger
as
he
gazed
at
his
brother
there
i
should
be
afraid
the
elder
did
not
answer
he
was
watching
the
melting
wax
of
the
candle
apparently
lost
in
thought
there
no
one
would
say
that
i
stole
went
on
crispin
mother
would
allow
it
if
she
knew
that
they
whip
me
the
elder
took
his
gaze
from
the
flame
raised
his
head
and
clutching
the
thick
rope
pulled
violently
on
it
so
that
a
sonorous
peal
of
the
bells
was
heard
are
we
always
going
to
live
this
way
brother
continued
crispin
i
like
to
get
sick
at
home
tomorrow
i
like
to
fall
into
a
long
sickness
so
that
mother
might
take
care
of
me
and
not
let
me
come
back
to
the
convento
so
i
not
be
called
a
thief
nor
would
they
whip
me
and
you
too
brother
you
must
get
sick
with
me
no
answered
the
older
we
should
all
die
mother
of
grief
and
we
of
hunger
crispin
remained
silent
for
a
moment
then
asked
how
much
will
you
get
this
month
two
pesos
they
fined
me
twice
then
pay
what
they
say
i
stolen
so
that
they
wo
call
us
thieves
pay
it
brother
are
you
crazy
crispin
mother
would
have
anything
to
eat
the
senior
sacristan
says
that
you
stolen
two
gold
pieces
and
worth
pesos
the
little
one
counted
on
his
fingers
up
to
six
hands
and
two
fingers
over
and
each
finger
a
peso
he
murmured
thoughtfully
and
each
peso
how
many
cuartos
a
hundred
and
sixty
a
hundred
and
sixty
cuartos
a
hundred
and
sixty
times
a
cuarto
goodness
and
how
many
are
a
hundred
and
sixty
hands
answered
the
older
crispin
looked
hard
at
his
little
hands
hands
he
repeated
six
hands
and
two
fingers
over
and
each
finger
hands
and
each
finger
a
cuarto
goodness
what
a
lot
of
cuartos
i
could
hardly
count
them
in
three
days
and
with
them
could
be
bought
shoes
for
our
feet
a
hat
for
my
head
when
the
sun
shines
hot
a
big
umbrella
for
the
rain
and
food
and
clothes
for
you
and
mother
and
he
became
silent
and
thoughtful
again
now
i
sorry
that
i
did
steal
he
soon
exclaimed
crispin
reproached
his
brother
do
get
angry
the
curate
has
said
that
he
beat
me
to
death
if
the
money
does
appear
and
if
i
had
stolen
it
i
could
make
it
appear
anyhow
if
i
died
you
and
mother
would
at
least
have
clothes
oh
if
i
had
only
stolen
it
the
elder
pulled
on
the
rope
in
silence
after
a
time
he
replied
with
a
sigh
what
i
afraid
of
is
that
mother
will
scold
you
when
she
knows
about
it
do
you
think
so
asked
the
younger
with
astonishment
you
will
tell
her
that
they
whipped
me
and
i
show
the
welts
on
my
back
and
my
torn
pocket
i
had
only
one
cuarto
which
was
given
to
me
last
easter
but
the
curate
took
that
away
from
me
yesterday
i
never
saw
a
prettier
cuarto
no
mother
wo
believe
it
if
the
curate
says
so
crispin
began
to
cry
murmuring
between
his
sobs
then
go
home
alone
i
do
want
to
go
tell
mother
that
i
sick
i
do
want
to
go
crispin
do
cry
pleaded
the
elder
mother
wo
believe
it
do
cry
old
tasio
told
us
that
a
fine
supper
is
waiting
for
us
a
fine
supper
and
i
have
eaten
for
a
long
time
they
wo
give
me
anything
to
eat
until
the
two
gold
pieces
appear
but
if
mother
believes
it
you
must
tell
her
that
the
senior
sacristan
is
a
liar
but
that
the
curate
believes
him
and
that
all
of
them
are
liars
that
they
say
that
we
thieves
because
our
father
is
a
vagabond
who
at
that
instant
a
head
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
stairway
leading
down
to
the
floor
below
and
that
head
like
medusa
froze
the
words
on
the
child
lips
it
was
a
long
narrow
head
covered
with
black
hair
with
blue
glasses
concealing
the
fact
that
one
eye
was
sightless
the
senior
sacristan
was
accustomed
to
appear
thus
without
noise
or
warning
of
any
kind
the
two
brothers
turned
cold
with
fear
on
you
basilio
i
impose
a
fine
of
two
reals
for
not
ringing
the
bells
in
time
he
said
in
a
voice
so
hollow
that
his
throat
seemed
to
lack
vocal
chords
you
crispin
must
stay
tonight
until
what
you
stole
reappears
crispin
looked
at
his
brother
as
if
pleading
for
protection
but
we
already
have
permission
mother
expects
us
at
eight
objected
basilio
timidly
neither
shall
you
go
home
at
eight
you
stay
until
ten
but
sir
after
nine
no
one
is
allowed
to
be
out
and
our
house
is
far
from
here
are
you
trying
to
give
me
orders
growled
the
man
irritably
as
he
caught
crispin
by
the
arm
and
started
to
drag
him
away
oh
sir
it
been
a
week
now
since
we
seen
our
mother
begged
basilio
catching
hold
of
his
brother
as
if
to
defend
him
the
senior
sacristan
struck
his
hand
away
and
jerked
at
crispin
who
began
to
weep
as
he
fell
to
the
floor
crying
out
to
his
brother
do
leave
me
they
going
to
kill
me
the
sacristan
gave
no
heed
to
this
and
dragged
him
on
to
the
stairway
as
they
disappeared
among
the
shadows
below
basilio
stood
speechless
listening
to
the
sounds
of
his
brother
body
striking
against
the
steps
then
followed
the
sound
of
a
blow
and
heartrending
cries
that
died
away
in
the
distance
the
boy
stood
on
tiptoe
hardly
breathing
and
listening
fixedly
with
his
eyes
unnaturally
wide
and
his
fists
clenched
when
shall
i
be
strong
enough
to
plow
a
field
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
as
he
started
below
hastily
upon
reaching
the
he
paused
to
listen
the
voice
of
his
brother
was
fast
dying
away
in
the
distance
and
the
cries
of
mother
brother
were
at
last
completely
cut
off
by
the
sound
of
a
closing
door
trembling
and
perspiring
he
paused
for
a
moment
with
his
fist
in
his
mouth
to
keep
down
a
cry
of
anguish
he
let
his
gaze
wander
about
the
dimly
lighted
church
where
an
gave
a
ghostly
light
revealing
the
catafalque
in
the
center
the
doors
were
closed
and
fastened
and
the
windows
had
iron
bars
on
them
suddenly
he
reascended
the
stairway
to
the
place
where
the
candle
was
burning
and
then
climbed
up
into
the
third
floor
of
the
belfry
after
untying
the
ropes
from
the
he
again
descended
he
was
pale
and
his
eyes
glistened
but
not
with
tears
meanwhile
the
rain
was
gradually
ceasing
and
the
sky
was
clearing
basilio
knotted
the
ropes
together
tied
one
end
to
a
rail
of
the
balustrade
and
without
even
remembering
to
put
out
the
light
let
himself
down
into
the
darkness
outside
a
few
moments
later
voices
were
heard
on
one
of
the
streets
of
the
town
two
shots
resounded
but
no
one
seemed
to
be
alarmed
and
silence
again
reigned
chapter
xvi
sisa
through
the
dark
night
the
villagers
slept
the
families
who
had
remembered
their
dead
gave
themselves
up
to
quiet
and
satisfied
sleep
for
they
had
recited
their
requiems
the
novena
of
the
souls
and
had
burned
many
wax
tapers
before
the
sacred
images
the
rich
and
powerful
had
discharged
the
duties
their
positions
imposed
upon
them
on
the
following
day
they
would
hear
three
masses
said
by
each
priest
and
would
give
two
pesos
for
another
besides
buying
a
bull
of
indulgences
for
the
dead
truly
divine
justice
is
not
nearly
so
exacting
as
human
but
the
poor
and
indigent
who
earn
scarcely
enough
to
keep
themselves
alive
and
who
also
have
to
pay
tribute
to
the
petty
officials
clerks
and
soldiers
that
they
may
be
allowed
to
live
in
peace
sleep
not
so
tranquilly
as
gentle
poets
who
have
perhaps
not
felt
the
pinches
of
want
would
have
us
believe
the
poor
are
sad
and
thoughtful
for
on
that
night
if
they
have
not
recited
many
prayers
yet
they
have
prayed
much
with
pain
in
their
eyes
and
tears
in
their
hearts
they
have
not
the
novenas
nor
do
they
know
the
responsories
versicles
and
prayers
which
the
friars
have
composed
for
those
who
lack
original
ideas
and
feelings
nor
do
they
understand
them
they
pray
in
the
language
of
their
misery
their
souls
weep
for
them
and
for
those
dead
beings
whose
love
was
their
wealth
their
lips
may
proffer
the
salutations
but
their
minds
cry
out
complaints
charged
with
lamentations
wilt
thou
be
satisfied
o
thou
who
blessedst
poverty
and
you
o
suffering
souls
with
the
simple
prayers
of
the
poor
offered
before
a
rude
picture
in
the
light
of
a
dim
wick
or
do
you
perhaps
desire
wax
tapers
before
bleeding
christs
and
virgins
with
small
mouths
and
crystal
eyes
and
masses
in
latin
recited
mechanically
by
priests
and
thou
religion
preached
for
suffering
humanity
hast
thou
forgotten
thy
mission
of
consoling
the
oppressed
in
their
misery
and
of
humiliating
the
powerful
in
their
pride
hast
thou
now
promises
only
for
the
rich
for
those
who
can
pay
thee
the
poor
widow
watches
among
the
children
who
sleep
at
her
side
she
is
thinking
of
the
indulgences
that
she
ought
to
buy
for
the
repose
of
the
souls
of
her
parents
and
of
her
dead
husband
a
peso
she
says
a
peso
is
a
week
of
happiness
for
my
children
a
week
of
laughter
and
joy
my
savings
for
a
month
a
dress
for
my
daughter
who
is
becoming
a
woman
but
it
is
necessary
that
you
put
aside
these
worldly
desires
says
the
voice
that
she
heard
in
the
pulpit
it
is
necessary
that
you
make
sacrifices
yes
it
is
necessary
the
church
does
not
gratuitously
save
the
beloved
souls
for
you
nor
does
it
distribute
indulgences
without
payment
you
must
buy
them
so
tonight
instead
of
sleeping
you
should
work
think
of
your
daughter
so
poorly
clothed
fast
for
heaven
is
dear
decidedly
it
seems
that
the
poor
enter
not
into
heaven
such
thoughts
wander
through
the
space
enclosed
between
the
rough
mats
spread
out
on
the
bamboo
floor
and
the
ridge
of
the
roof
from
which
hangs
the
hammock
wherein
the
baby
swings
the
infant
breathing
is
easy
and
peaceful
but
from
time
to
time
he
swallows
and
smacks
his
lips
his
hungry
stomach
which
is
not
satisfied
with
what
his
older
brothers
have
given
him
dreams
of
eating
the
cicadas
chant
monotonously
mingling
their
ceaseless
notes
with
the
trills
of
the
cricket
hidden
in
the
grass
or
the
chirp
of
the
little
lizard
which
has
come
out
in
search
of
food
while
the
big
gekko
no
longer
fearing
the
water
disturbs
the
concert
with
its
voice
as
it
shows
its
head
from
out
the
hollow
of
the
decayed
the
dogs
howl
mournfully
in
the
streets
and
superstitious
folk
hearing
them
are
convinced
that
they
see
spirits
and
ghosts
but
neither
the
dogs
nor
the
other
animals
see
the
sorrows
of
men
yet
how
many
of
these
exist
distant
from
the
town
an
hour
walk
lives
the
mother
of
basilio
and
crispin
the
wife
of
a
heartless
man
she
struggles
to
live
for
her
sons
while
her
husband
is
a
vagrant
gamester
with
whom
her
interviews
are
rare
but
always
painful
he
has
gradually
stripped
her
of
her
few
jewels
to
pay
the
cost
of
his
vices
and
when
the
suffering
sisa
no
longer
had
anything
that
he
might
take
to
satisfy
his
whims
he
had
begun
to
maltreat
her
weak
in
character
with
more
heart
than
intellect
she
knew
only
how
to
love
and
to
weep
her
husband
was
a
god
and
her
sons
were
his
angels
so
he
knowing
to
what
point
he
was
loved
and
feared
conducted
himself
like
all
false
gods
daily
he
became
more
cruel
more
inhuman
more
wilful
once
when
he
had
appeared
with
his
countenance
gloomier
than
ever
before
sisa
had
consulted
him
about
the
plan
of
making
a
sacristan
of
basilio
and
he
had
merely
continued
to
stroke
his
saying
neither
yes
nor
no
only
asking
whether
the
boy
would
earn
much
money
she
had
not
dared
to
insist
but
her
needy
situation
and
her
desire
that
the
boys
should
learn
to
read
and
write
in
the
town
school
forced
her
to
carry
out
the
plan
still
her
husband
had
said
nothing
that
night
between
ten
and
eleven
when
the
stars
were
glittering
in
a
sky
now
cleared
of
all
signs
of
the
storm
of
the
early
evening
sisa
sat
on
a
wooden
bench
watching
some
fagots
that
smouldered
upon
the
fireplace
fashioned
of
rough
pieces
of
natural
rock
upon
a
tripod
or
was
a
small
pot
of
boiling
rice
and
upon
the
red
coals
lay
three
little
dried
fishes
such
as
are
sold
at
three
for
two
cuartos
her
chin
rested
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
while
she
gazed
at
the
weak
yellow
glow
peculiar
to
the
cane
which
burns
rapidly
and
leaves
embers
that
quickly
grow
pale
a
sad
smile
lighted
up
her
face
as
she
recalled
a
funny
riddle
about
the
pot
and
the
fire
which
crispin
had
once
propounded
to
her
the
boy
said
the
black
man
sat
down
and
the
red
man
looked
at
him
a
moment
passed
and
rang
forth
sisa
was
still
young
and
it
was
plain
that
at
one
time
she
had
been
pretty
and
attractive
her
eyes
which
like
her
disposition
she
had
given
to
her
sons
were
beautiful
with
long
lashes
and
a
deep
look
her
nose
was
regular
and
her
pale
lips
curved
pleasantly
she
was
what
the
tagalogs
call
that
is
her
color
was
a
clear
pure
brown
in
spite
of
her
youthfulness
pain
and
perhaps
even
hunger
had
begun
to
make
hollow
her
pallid
cheeks
and
if
her
abundant
hair
in
other
times
the
delight
and
adornment
of
her
person
was
even
yet
simply
and
neatly
arranged
though
without
pins
or
combs
it
was
not
from
coquetry
but
from
habit
sisa
had
been
for
several
days
confined
to
the
house
sewing
upon
some
work
which
had
been
ordered
for
the
earliest
possible
time
in
order
to
earn
the
money
she
had
not
attended
mass
that
morning
as
it
would
have
taken
two
hours
at
least
to
go
to
the
town
and
return
poverty
obliges
one
to
sin
she
had
finished
the
work
and
delivered
it
but
had
received
only
a
promise
of
payment
all
that
day
she
had
been
anticipating
the
pleasures
of
the
evening
for
she
knew
that
her
sons
were
coming
and
she
had
intended
to
make
them
some
presents
she
had
bought
some
small
fishes
picked
the
most
beautiful
tomatoes
in
her
little
garden
as
she
knew
that
crispin
was
very
fond
of
them
and
begged
from
a
neighbor
old
tasio
the
sage
who
lived
half
a
mile
away
some
slices
of
dried
wild
boar
meat
and
a
leg
of
wild
duck
which
basilio
especially
liked
full
of
hope
she
had
cooked
the
whitest
of
rice
which
she
herself
had
gleaned
from
the
it
was
indeed
a
curate
meal
for
the
poor
boys
but
by
an
unfortunate
chance
her
husband
came
and
ate
the
rice
the
slices
of
wild
boar
meat
the
duck
leg
five
of
the
little
fishes
and
the
tomatoes
sisa
said
nothing
although
she
felt
as
if
she
herself
were
being
eaten
his
hunger
at
length
appeased
he
remembered
to
ask
for
the
boys
then
sisa
smiled
happily
and
resolved
that
she
would
not
eat
that
night
because
what
remained
was
not
enough
for
three
the
father
had
asked
for
their
sons
and
that
for
her
was
better
than
eating
soon
he
picked
up
his
and
started
away
do
you
want
to
see
them
she
asked
tremulously
old
tasio
told
me
that
they
would
be
a
little
late
crispin
now
knows
how
to
read
and
perhaps
basilio
will
bring
his
wages
this
last
reason
caused
the
husband
to
pause
and
waver
but
his
good
angel
triumphed
in
that
case
keep
a
peso
for
me
he
said
as
he
went
away
sisa
wept
bitterly
but
the
thought
of
her
sons
soon
dried
her
tears
she
cooked
some
more
rice
and
prepared
the
only
three
fishes
that
were
left
each
would
have
one
and
a
half
they
have
good
appetites
she
mused
the
way
is
long
and
hungry
stomachs
have
no
heart
so
she
sat
he
ear
strained
to
catch
every
sound
listening
to
the
lightest
footfalls
strong
and
clear
basilio
light
and
irregular
crispin
thus
she
mused
the
called
in
the
woods
several
times
after
the
rain
had
ceased
but
still
her
sons
did
not
come
she
put
the
fishes
inside
the
pot
to
keep
them
warm
and
went
to
the
threshold
of
the
hut
to
look
toward
the
road
to
keep
herself
company
she
began
to
sing
in
a
low
voice
a
voice
usually
so
sweet
and
tender
that
when
her
sons
listened
to
her
singing
the
they
wept
without
knowing
why
but
tonight
it
trembled
and
the
notes
were
halting
she
stopped
singing
and
gazed
earnestly
into
the
darkness
but
no
one
was
coming
from
the
town
that
noise
was
only
the
wind
shaking
the
raindrops
from
the
wide
banana
leaves
suddenly
a
black
dog
appeared
before
her
dragging
something
along
the
path
sisa
was
frightened
but
caught
up
a
stone
and
threw
it
at
the
dog
which
ran
away
howling
mournfully
she
was
not
superstitious
but
she
had
heard
so
much
about
presentiments
and
black
dogs
that
terror
seized
her
she
shut
the
door
hastily
and
sat
down
by
the
light
night
favors
credulity
and
the
imagination
peoples
the
air
with
specters
she
tried
to
pray
to
call
upon
the
virgin
and
upon
god
to
watch
over
her
sons
especially
her
little
crispin
then
she
forgot
her
prayers
as
her
thoughts
wandered
to
think
about
them
to
recall
the
features
of
each
those
features
that
always
wore
a
smile
for
her
both
asleep
and
awake
suddenly
she
felt
her
hair
rise
on
her
head
and
her
eyes
stared
wildly
illusion
or
reality
she
saw
crispin
standing
by
the
fireplace
there
where
he
was
wont
to
sit
and
prattle
to
her
but
now
he
said
nothing
as
he
gazed
at
her
with
those
large
thoughtful
eyes
and
smiled
mother
open
the
door
open
mother
cried
the
voice
of
basilio
from
without
sisa
shuddered
violently
and
the
vision
disappeared
chapter

basilio
la
vida
es
sueño
basilio
was
scarcely
inside
when
he
staggered
and
fell
into
his
mother
arms
an
inexplicable
chill
seized
sisa
as
she
saw
him
enter
alone
she
wanted
to
speak
but
could
make
no
sound
she
wanted
to
embrace
her
son
but
lacked
the
strength
to
weep
was
impossible
at
sight
of
the
blood
which
covered
the
boy
forehead
she
cried
in
a
tone
that
seemed
to
come
from
a
breaking
heart
my
sons
do
be
afraid
mother
basilio
reassured
her
crispin
stayed
at
the
convento
at
the
convento
he
stayed
at
the
convento
is
he
alive
the
boy
raised
his
eyes
to
her
ah
she
sighed
passing
from
the
depths
of
sorrow
to
the
heights
of
joy
she
wept
and
embraced
her
son
covering
his
bloody
forehead
with
kisses
crispin
is
alive
you
left
him
at
the
convento
but
why
are
you
wounded
my
son
have
you
had
a
fall
she
inquired
as
she
examined
him
anxiously
the
senior
sacristan
took
crispin
away
and
told
me
that
i
could
not
leave
until
ten
but
it
was
already
late
and
so
i
ran
away
in
the
town
the
soldiers
challenged
me
i
started
to
run
they
fired
and
a
bullet
grazed
my
forehead
i
was
afraid
they
would
arrest
me
and
beat
me
and
make
me
scrub
out
the
barracks
as
they
did
with
pablo
who
is
still
sick
from
it
my
god
my
god
murmured
his
mother
shuddering
thou
hast
saved
him
then
while
she
sought
for
bandages
water
vinegar
and
a
feather
she
went
on
a
finger
breadth
more
and
they
would
have
killed
you
they
would
have
killed
my
boy
the
do
not
think
of
the
mothers
you
must
say
that
i
fell
from
a
tree
so
that
no
one
will
know
they
chased
me
basilio
cautioned
her
why
did
crispin
stay
asked
sisa
after
dressing
her
son
wound
basilio
hesitated
a
few
moments
then
with
his
arms
about
her
and
their
tears
mingling
he
related
little
by
little
the
story
of
the
gold
pieces
without
speaking
however
of
the
tortures
they
were
inflicting
upon
his
young
brother
my
good
crispin
to
accuse
my
good
crispin
it
because
we
poor
and
we
poor
people
have
to
endure
everything
murmured
sisa
staring
through
her
tears
at
the
light
of
the
lamp
which
was
now
dying
out
from
lack
of
oil
so
they
remained
silent
for
a
while
have
you
had
any
supper
yet
here
are
rice
and
fish
i
do
want
anything
only
a
little
water
yes
answered
his
mother
sadly
i
know
that
you
do
like
dried
fish
i
had
prepared
something
else
but
your
father
came
father
came
asked
basilio
instinctively
examining
the
face
and
hands
of
his
mother
the
son
questioning
gaze
pained
sisa
heart
for
she
understood
it
only
too
well
so
she
added
hastily
he
came
and
asked
a
lot
about
you
and
wanted
to
see
you
and
he
was
very
hungry
he
said
that
if
you
continued
to
be
so
good
he
would
come
back
to
stay
with
us
an
exclamation
of
disgust
from
basilio
contracted
lips
interrupted
her
son
she
reproached
him
forgive
me
mother
he
answered
seriously
but
are
we
three
better
off
you
crispin
and
i
you
crying
i
have
said
anything
sisa
sighed
and
asked
are
you
going
to
eat
then
let
go
to
sleep
for
it
now
very
late
she
then
closed
up
the
hut
and
covered
the
few
coals
with
ashes
so
that
the
fire
would
not
die
out
entirely
just
as
a
man
does
with
his
inner
feelings
he
covers
them
with
the
ashes
of
his
life
which
he
calls
indifference
so
that
they
may
not
be
deadened
by
daily
contact
with
his
fellows
basilio
murmured
his
prayers
and
lay
down
near
his
mother
who
was
upon
her
knees
praying
he
felt
hot
and
cold
he
tried
to
close
his
eyes
as
he
thought
of
his
little
brother
who
that
night
had
expected
to
sleep
in
his
mother
lap
and
who
now
was
probably
trembling
with
terror
and
weeping
in
some
dark
corner
of
the
convento
his
ears
were
again
pierced
with
those
cries
he
had
heard
in
the
church
tower
but
wearied
nature
soon
began
to
confuse
his
ideas
and
the
veil
of
sleep
descended
upon
his
eyes
he
saw
a
bedroom
where
two
dim
tapers
burned
the
curate
with
a
rattan
whip
in
his
hand
was
listening
gloomily
to
something
that
the
senior
sacristan
was
telling
him
in
a
strange
tongue
with
horrible
gestures
crispin
quailed
and
turned
his
tearful
eyes
in
every
direction
as
if
seeking
some
one
or
some
the
curate
turned
toward
him
and
called
to
him
irritably
the
rattan
whistled
the
child
ran
to
hide
himself
behind
the
sacristan
who
caught
and
held
him
thus
exposing
him
to
the
curate
fury
the
unfortunate
boy
fought
kicked
screamed
threw
himself
on
the
floor
and
rolled
about
he
picked
himself
up
ran
slipped
fell
and
parried
the
blows
with
his
hands
which
wounded
he
hid
quickly
all
the
time
shrieking
with
pain
basilio
saw
him
twist
himself
strike
the
floor
with
his
head
he
saw
and
heard
the
rattan
whistle
in
desperation
his
little
brother
rose
mad
with
pain
he
threw
himself
upon
his
tormentor
and
bit
him
on
the
hand
the
curate
gave
a
cry
and
dropped
the
rattan
the
sacristan
caught
up
a
heavy
cane
and
struck
the
boy
a
blow
on
the
head
so
that
he
fell
stunned
the
curate
seeing
him
down
trampled
him
with
his
feet
but
the
child
no
longer
defended
himself
nor
did
he
cry
out
he
rolled
along
the
floor
a
lifeless
mass
that
left
a
damp
track
sisa
voice
brought
him
back
to
reality
what
the
matter
why
are
you
crying
i
dreamed
o
god
exclaimed
basilio
sitting
up
covered
with
perspiration
it
was
a
dream
tell
me
mother
that
it
was
only
a
dream
only
a
dream
what
did
you
dream
the
boy
did
not
answer
but
sat
drying
his
tears
and
wiping
away
the
perspiration
the
hut
was
in
total
darkness
a
dream
a
dream
repeated
basilio
in
subdued
tones
tell
me
what
you
dreamed
i
ca
sleep
said
his
mother
when
he
lay
down
again
well
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
dreamed
that
we
had
gone
to
glean
the
in
a
field
where
there
were
many
flowers
the
women
had
baskets
full
of
the
men
too
had
baskets
full
of
and
the
children
too
i
do
remember
any
more
mother
i
do
remember
the
rest
sisa
had
no
faith
in
dreams
so
she
did
not
insist
mother
i
thought
of
a
plan
tonight
said
basilio
after
a
few
moments
silence
what
is
your
plan
she
asked
sisa
was
humble
in
everything
even
with
her
own
sons
trusting
their
judgment
more
than
her
own
i
do
want
to
be
a
sacristan
any
longer
what
listen
mother
to
what
i
been
thinking
about
today
there
arrived
from
spain
the
son
of
the
dead
don
rafael
and
he
will
be
a
good
man
like
his
father
well
now
mother
tomorrow
you
will
get
crispin
collect
my
wages
and
say
that
i
will
not
be
a
sacristan
any
longer
as
soon
as
i
get
well
i
go
to
see
don
crisostomo
and
ask
him
to
hire
me
as
a
herdsman
of
his
cattle
and
carabaos
i
now
big
enough
crispin
can
study
with
old
tasio
who
does
not
whip
and
who
is
a
good
man
even
if
the
curate
does
not
believe
so
what
have
we
to
fear
now
from
the
padre
can
he
make
us
any
poorer
than
we
are
you
may
believe
it
mother
the
old
man
is
good
i
seen
him
often
in
the
church
when
no
one
else
was
about
kneeling
and
praying
believe
it
so
mother
i
stop
being
a
sacristan
i
earn
but
little
and
that
little
is
taken
away
from
me
in
fines
every
one
complains
of
the
same
thing
be
a
herdsman
and
by
performing
my
tasks
carefully
i
make
my
employer
like
me
perhaps
he
let
us
milk
a
cow
so
that
we
can
drink
milk
crispin
likes
milk
so
much
who
can
tell
maybe
they
give
us
a
little
calf
if
they
see
that
i
behave
well
and
we
take
care
of
it
and
fatten
it
like
our
hen
i
pick
fruits
in
the
woods
and
sell
them
in
the
town
along
with
the
vegetables
from
our
garden
so
have
money
i
set
snares
and
traps
to
catch
birds
and
wild
cats
i
fish
in
the
river
and
when
i
bigger
i
hunt
i
be
able
also
to
cut
firewood
to
sell
or
to
present
to
the
owner
of
the
cows
and
so
he
be
satisfied
with
us
when
i
able
to
plow
ask
him
to
let
me
have
a
piece
of
land
to
plant
in
or
corn
and
you
wo
have
to
sew
until
midnight
we
have
new
clothes
for
every
fiesta
we
eat
meat
and
big
fish
we
live
free
seeing
each
other
every
day
and
eating
together
old
tasio
says
that
crispin
has
a
good
head
and
so
we
send
him
to
manila
to
study
i
support
him
by
working
hard
is
that
fine
mother
perhaps
he
be
a
doctor
what
do
you
say
what
can
i
say
but
yes
said
sisa
as
she
embraced
her
son
she
noted
however
that
in
their
future
the
boy
took
no
account
of
his
father
and
shed
silent
tears
basilio
went
on
talking
of
his
plans
with
the
confidence
of
the
years
that
see
only
what
they
wish
for
to
everything
sisa
said
yes
everything
appeared
good
sleep
again
began
to
weigh
down
upon
the
tired
eyelids
of
the
boy
and
this
time
of
whom
andersen
tells
us
spread
over
him
his
beautiful
umbrella
with
its
pleasing
pictures
now
he
saw
himself
with
his
little
brother
as
they
picked
guavas
alpay
and
other
fruits
in
the
woods
they
clambered
from
branch
to
branch
light
as
butterflies
they
penetrated
into
the
caves
and
saw
the
shining
rocks
they
bathed
in
the
springs
where
the
sand
was
and
the
stones
like
the
jewels
in
the
virgin
crown
the
little
fishes
sang
and
laughed
the
plants
bent
their
branches
toward
them
laden
with
golden
fruit
then
he
saw
a
bell
hanging
in
a
tree
with
a
long
rope
for
ringing
it
to
the
rope
was
tied
a
cow
with
a
bird
nest
between
her
horns
and
crispin
was
inside
the
bell
thus
he
went
on
dreaming
while
his
mother
who
was
not
of
his
age
and
who
had
not
run
for
an
hour
slept
not
chapter
xviii
souls
in
torment
it
was
about
seven
in
the
morning
when
fray
salvi
finished
celebrating
his
last
mass
having
offered
up
three
in
the
space
of
an
hour
the
padre
is
ill
commented
the
pious
women
he
move
about
with
his
usual
slowness
and
elegance
of
manner
he
took
off
his
vestments
without
the
least
comment
without
saying
a
word
or
looking
at
any
one
attention
whispered
the
sacristans
among
themselves
the
devil
to
pay
it
going
to
rain
fines
and
all
on
account
of
those
two
brothers
he
left
the
sacristy
to
go
up
into
the
rectory
in
the
hallway
of
which
there
awaited
him
some
seven
or
eight
women
seated
upon
benches
and
a
man
who
was
pacing
back
and
forth
upon
seeing
him
approach
the
women
arose
and
one
of
them
pressed
forward
to
kiss
his
hand
but
the
holy
man
made
a
sign
of
impatience
that
stopped
her
short
can
it
be
that
you
lost
a
real
exclaimed
the
woman
with
a
jesting
laugh
offended
at
such
a
reception
not
to
give
his
hand
to
me
matron
of
the
sisterhood
sister
rufa
it
was
an
proceeding
he
did
go
into
the
confessional
this
morning
added
sister
sipa
a
toothless
old
woman
i
wanted
to
confess
myself
so
as
to
receive
communion
and
get
the
indulgences
well
i
sorry
for
you
commented
a
young
woman
with
a
frank
face
this
week
i
earned
three
plenary
indulgences
and
dedicated
them
to
the
soul
of
my
husband
badly
done
sister
juana
said
the
offended
rufa
one
plenary
indulgence
was
enough
to
get
him
out
of
purgatory
you
ought
not
to
squander
the
holy
indulgences
do
as
i
do
i
thought
so
many
more
the
better
answered
the
simple
sister
juana
smiling
but
tell
me
what
you
do
sister
rufa
did
not
answer
at
once
first
she
asked
for
a
buyo
and
chewed
at
it
gazed
at
her
audience
which
was
listening
attentively
then
spat
to
one
side
and
commenced
chewing
at
the
buyo
meanwhile
i
do
misspend
one
holy
day
since
i
belonged
to
the
sisterhood
earned
four
hundred
and
plenary
indulgences
seven
hundred
sixty
thousand
five
hundred
and
years
of
indulgence
i
set
down
all
that
i
earn
for
i
like
to
have
clean
accounts
i
want
to
cheat
or
be
cheated
here
sister
rufa
paused
to
give
more
attention
to
her
chewing
the
women
gazed
at
her
in
admiration
but
the
man
who
was
pacing
back
and
forth
remarked
with
some
disdain
well
this
year
i
gained
four
plenary
indulgences
more
than
you
have
sister
rufa
and
a
hundred
years
more
and
that
without
praying
much
either
more
than
i
more
than
six
hundred
and
plenary
indulgences
or
nine
hundred
thousand
eight
hundred
and
years
queried
rufa
somewhat
disgruntled
that
it
eight
indulgences
and
a
hundred
fifteen
years
more
and
a
few
months
over
answered
the
man
from
whose
neck
hung
soiled
scapularies
and
rosaries
that
not
strange
admitted
rufa
at
last
admitting
defeat
an
expert
the
best
in
the
province
the
flattered
man
smiled
and
continued
it
is
so
wonderful
that
i
earn
more
than
you
do
why
i
can
almost
say
that
even
when
sleeping
i
earn
indulgences
and
what
do
you
do
with
them
sir
asked
four
or
five
voices
at
the
same
time
pish
answered
the
man
with
a
gesture
of
proud
disdain
i
have
them
to
throw
away
but
in
that
i
ca
commend
you
sir
protested
rufa
you
go
to
purgatory
for
wasting
the
indulgences
you
know
very
well
that
for
every
idle
word
one
must
suffer
forty
days
in
fire
according
to
the
curate
for
every
span
of
thread
uselessly
wasted
sixty
days
and
for
every
drop
of
water
spilled
twenty
you
go
to
purgatory
well
i
know
how
to
get
out
answered
brother
pedro
with
sublime
confidence
how
many
souls
have
i
saved
from
the
flames
how
many
saints
have
i
made
besides
even
articulo
i
can
still
earn
if
i
wish
at
least
seven
plenary
indulgences
and
shall
be
able
to
save
others
as
i
die
so
saying
he
strode
proudly
away
sister
rufa
turned
to
the
others
nevertheless
you
must
do
as
i
do
for
i
do
lose
a
single
day
and
i
keep
my
accounts
well
i
want
to
cheat
or
be
cheated
well
what
do
you
do
asked
juana
you
must
imitate
what
i
do
for
example
suppose
i
earn
a
year
of
indulgence
i
set
it
down
in
my
and
say
blessed
father
and
lord
dominic
please
see
if
there
is
anybody
in
purgatory
who
needs
exactly
a
year
neither
a
day
more
nor
a
day
less
then
i
play
heads
and
tails
if
it
comes
heads
no
if
tails
yes
let
suppose
that
it
comes
tails
then
i
write
down
if
it
comes
heads
then
i
keep
the
indulgence
in
this
way
i
arrange
groups
of
a
hundred
years
each
of
which
i
keep
a
careful
account
it
a
pity
that
we
ca
do
with
them
as
with
money
put
them
out
at
interest
for
in
that
way
we
should
be
able
to
save
more
souls
believe
me
and
do
as
i
do
well
i
do
it
a
better
way
remarked
sister
sipa
what
better
demanded
the
astonished
rufa
that
ca
be
my
system
ca
be
improved
upon
listen
a
moment
and
you
be
convinced
sister
said
old
sipa
in
a
tone
of
vexation
how
is
it
let
hear
exclaimed
the
others
after
coughing
ceremoniously
the
old
woman
began
with
great
care
you
know
very
well
that
by
saying
the
sea
tu
and
the
mío
jesucristo
padre
dulcísimo
por
el
ten
years
are
gained
for
each
letter
twenty
no
less
five
interrupted
several
voices
a
few
years
more
or
less
make
no
difference
now
when
a
servant
breaks
a
plate
a
glass
or
a
cup
i
make
him
pick
up
the
pieces
and
for
every
scrap
even
the
very
smallest
he
has
to
recite
for
me
one
of
those
prayers
the
indulgences
that
i
earn
in
this
way
i
devote
to
the
souls
every
one
in
my
house
except
the
cats
understands
this
system
but
those
indulgences
are
earned
by
the
servants
and
not
by
you
sister
sipa
objected
rufa
and
my
cups
and
plates
who
pays
for
them
the
servants
are
glad
to
pay
for
them
in
that
way
and
it
suits
me
also
i
never
resort
to
blows
only
sometimes
a
pinch
or
a
whack
on
the
head
i
going
to
do
as
you
do
i
do
the
same
and
i
exclaimed
the
women
but
suppose
the
plate
is
only
broken
into
two
or
three
pieces
then
you
earn
very
few
observed
the
obstinate
rufa
answered
old
sipa
i
make
them
recite
the
prayers
anyhow
then
i
glue
the
pieces
together
again
and
so
lose
nothing
sister
rufa
had
no
more
objections
left
allow
me
to
ask
about
a
doubt
of
mine
said
young
juana
timidly
you
ladies
understand
so
well
these
matters
of
heaven
purgatory
and
hell
while
i
confess
that
i
ignorant
often
i
find
in
the
novenas
and
other
books
this
direction
three
paternosters
three
ave
marias
and
three
gloria
patris
yes
well
now
i
want
to
know
how
they
should
be
recited
whether

way
wo
get
anything
from
your
novenas
replied
old
sipa
who
wo
asked
rufa
rising
a
short
time
ago
i
lost
a
little
pig
i
prayed
to
anthony
and
found
it
and
then
i
sold
it
for
a
good
price
yes
then
that
why
one
of
your
neighbors
was
saying
that
you
sold
a
pig
of
hers
who
the
shameless
one
perhaps
i
like
you
here
the
expert
had
to
interfere
to
restore
peace
for
no
one
was
thinking
any
more
about
paternosters
the
talk
was
all
about
pigs
come
come
there
must
be
any
quarrel
over
a
pig
sisters
the
holy
scriptures
give
us
an
example
to
follow
the
heretics
and
protestants
did
quarrel
with
our
lord
for
driving
into
the
water
a
herd
of
swine
that
belonged
to
them
and
we
that
are
christians
and
besides
brethren
of
the
holy
rosary
shall
we
have
hard
words
on
account
of
a
little
pig
what
would
our
rivals
the
tertiary
brethren
say
all
became
silent
before
such
wisdom
at
the
same
time
fearing
what
the
tertiary
brethren
might
say
the
expert
well
satisfied
with
such
acquiescence
changed
his
tone
and
continued
soon
the
curate
will
send
for
us
we
must
tell
him
which
preacher
we
chosen
of
the
three
that
he
suggested
yesterday
whether
padre
damaso
padre
martin
or
the
coadjutor
i
do
know
whether
the
tertiary
brethren
have
yet
made
any
choice
so
we
must
decide
the
coadjutor
murmured
juana
timidly
ahem
the
coadjutor
does
know
how
to
preach
declared
sipa
padre
martin
is
better
padre
martin
exclaimed
another
disdainfully
he
has
any
voice
padre
damaso
would
be
better
that
right
cried
rufa
padre
damaso
surely
does
know
how
to
preach
he
looks
like
a
comedian
but
we
do
understand
him
murmured
juana
because
he
very
deep
and
as
he
preaches
well
this
speech
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
sisa
who
was
carrying
a
basket
on
her
head
she
saluted
the
sisters
and
went
on
up
the
stairway
she
going
in
let
go
in
too
they
exclaimed
sisa
felt
her
heart
beating
violently
as
she
ascended
the
stairs
she
did
not
know
just
what
to
say
to
the
padre
to
placate
his
wrath
or
what
reasons
she
could
advance
in
defense
of
her
son
that
morning
at
the
first
flush
of
dawn
she
had
gone
into
her
garden
to
pick
the
choicest
vegetables
which
she
placed
in
a
basket
among
and
flowers
then
she
had
looked
along
the
bank
of
the
river
for
the
which
she
knew
the
curate
liked
for
salads
putting
on
her
best
clothes
and
without
awakening
her
son
she
had
set
out
for
the
town
with
the
basket
on
her
head
as
she
went
up
the
stairway
she
tried
to
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
and
listened
attentively
in
the
hope
that
she
might
hear
a
fresh
childish
voice
so
well
known
to
her
but
she
heard
nothing
nor
did
she
meet
any
one
as
she
made
her
way
to
the
kitchen
there
she
looked
into
all
the
corners
the
servants
and
sacristans
received
her
coldly
scarcely
acknowledging
her
greeting
where
can
i
put
these
vegetables
she
asked
not
taking
any
offense
at
their
coldness
there
anywhere
growled
the
cook
hardly
looking
at
her
as
he
busied
himself
in
picking
the
feathers
from
a
capon
with
great
care
sisa
arranged
the
vegetables
and
the
salad
leaves
on
the
table
placing
the
flowers
above
them
smiling
she
then
addressed
one
of
the
servants
who
seemed
to
be
more
approachable
than
the
cook
may
i
speak
with
the
padre
he
sick
was
the
whispered
answer
and
crispin
do
you
know
if
he
is
in
the
sacristy
the
servant
looked
surprised
and
wrinkled
his
eyebrows
crispin
is
he
at
your
house
do
you
mean
to
deny
it
basilio
is
at
home
but
crispin
stayed
here
answered
sisa
and
i
want
to
see
him
yes
he
stayed
but
afterwards
he
ran
away
after
stealing
a
lot
of
things
early
this
morning
the
curate
ordered
me
to
go
and
report
it
to
the
civil
guard
they
must
have
gone
to
your
house
already
to
hunt
for
the
boys
sisa
covered
her
ears
and
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
but
her
lips
moved
without
giving
out
any
sound
a
pretty
pair
of
sons
you
have
exclaimed
the
cook
it
plain
that
you
a
faithful
wife
the
sons
are
so
like
the
father
take
care
that
the
younger
does
surpass
him
sisa
broke
out
into
bitter
weeping
and
let
herself
fall
upon
a
bench
do
cry
here
yelled
the
cook
do
you
know
that
the
sick
get
out
in
the
street
and
cry
the
unfortunate
mother
was
almost
shoved
down
the
stairway
at
the
very
time
when
the
sisters
were
coming
down
complaining
and
making
conjectures
about
the
curate
illness
so
she
hid
her
face
in
her
pañuelo
and
suppressed
the
sounds
of
her
grief
upon
reaching
the
street
she
looked
about
uncertainly
for
a
moment
and
then
as
if
having
reached
a
decision
walked
rapidly
away

responded
to
the
fury

as
the
first
reflections
of
light
awoke
on
its
surface
the
phosphorescent
spirits
there
were
outlined
in
the
distance
almost
on
the
horizon
the
gray
silhouettes
of
the
little
bankas
of
the
fishermen
who
were
taking
in
their
nets
and
of
the
larger
craft
spreading
their
sails
two
men
dressed
in
deep
mourning
stood
gazing
at
the
water
from
a
little
elevation
one
was
ibarra
and
the
other
a
youth
of
humble
aspect
and
melancholy
features
this
is
the
place
the
latter
was
saying
from
here
your
body
was
thrown
into
the
water
here
where
the
brought
lieutenant
guevara
and
me
ibarra
warmly
grasped
the
hand
of
the
young
man
who
went
on
you
have
no
occasion
to
thank
me
i
owed
many
favors
to
your
father
and
the
only
thing
that
i
could
do
for
him
was
to
accompany
his
body
to
the
grave
i
came
here
without
knowing
any
one
without
recommendation
and
having
neither
name
nor
fortune
just
as
at
present
my
predecessor
had
abandoned
the
school
to
engage
in
the
tobacco
trade
your
father
protected
me
secured
me
a
house
and
furnished
whatever
was
necessary
for
running
the
school
he
used
to
visit
the
classes
and
distribute
pictures
among
the
poor
but
studious
children
as
well
as
provide
them
with
books
and
paper
but
this
like
all
good
things
lasted
only
a
little
while
ibarra
took
off
his
hat
and
seemed
to
be
praying
for
a
time
then
he
turned
to
his
companion
did
you
say
that
my
father
helped
the
poor
children
and
now
now
they
get
along
as
well
as
possible
and
write
when
they
can
answered
the
youth
what
is
the
reason
the
reason
lies
in
their
torn
camisas
and
their
downcast
eyes
how
many
pupils
have
you
now
asked
ibarra
with
interest
after
a
pause
more
than
two
hundred
on
the
roll
but
only
about
in
actual
attendance
how
does
that
happen
the
schoolmaster
smiled
sadly
as
he
answered
to
tell
you
the
reasons
would
make
a
long
and
tiresome
story
do
attribute
my
question
to
idle
curiosity
replied
ibarra
gravely
while
he
stared
at
the
distant
horizon
i
thought
better
of
it
and
believe
that
to
carry
out
my
father
ideas
will
be
more
fitting
than
to
weep
for
him
and
far
better
than
to
revenge
him
sacred
nature
has
become
his
grave
and
his
enemies
were
the
people
and
a
priest
the
former
i
pardon
on
account
of
their
ignorance
and
the
latter
because
i
wish
that
religion
which
elevated
society
should
be
respected
i
wish
to
be
inspired
with
the
spirit
of
him
who
gave
me
life
and
therefore
desire
to
know
about
the
obstacles
encountered
here
in
educational
work
the
country
will
bless
your
memory
sir
said
the
schoolmaster
if
you
carry
out
the
beautiful
plans
of
your
dead
father
you
wish
to
know
the
obstacles
which
the
progress
of
education
meets
well
then
under
present
circumstances
without
substantial
aid
education
will
never
amount
to
much
in
the
very
first
place
because
even
when
we
have
the
pupils
lack
of
suitable
means
and
other
things
that
attract
them
more
kill
off
their
interest
it
is
said
that
in
germany
a
peasant
son
studies
for
eight
years
in
the
town
school
but
who
here
would
spend
half
that
time
when
such
poor
results
are
to
be
obtained
they
read
write
and
memorize
selections
and
sometimes
whole
books
in
spanish
without
understanding
a
single
word
what
benefit
does
our
country
child
get
from
the
school
and
why
have
you
who
see
the
evil
not
thought
of
remedying
it
the
schoolmaster
shook
his
head
sadly
a
poor
teacher
struggles
not
only
against
prejudices
but
also
against
certain
influences
first
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
a
suitable
place
and
not
to
do
as
i
must
at
present
hold
the
classes
under
the
convento
by
the
side
of
the
padre
carriage
there
the
children
who
like
to
read
aloud
very
naturally
disturb
the
padre
and
he
often
comes
down
nervous
especially
when
he
has
his
attacks
yells
at
them
and
even
insults
me
at
times
you
know
that
no
one
can
either
teach
or
learn
under
such
circumstances
for
the
child
will
not
respect
his
teacher
when
he
sees
him
abused
without
standing
up
for
his
rights
in
order
to
be
heeded
and
to
maintain
his
authority
the
teacher
needs
prestige
reputation
moral
strength
and
some
freedom
of
action
now
let
me
recount
to
you
even
sadder
details
i
have
wished
to
introduce
reforms
and
have
been
laughed
at
in
order
to
remedy
the
evil
of
which
i
just
spoke
to
you
i
tried
to
teach
spanish
to
the
children
because
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
government
so
orders
i
thought
also
that
it
would
be
of
advantage
for
everybody
i
used
the
simplest
method
of
words
and
phrases
without
paying
any
attention
to
long
rules
expecting
to
teach
them
grammar
when
they
should
understand
the
language
at
the
end
of
a
few
weeks
some
of
the
brightest
were
almost
able
to
understand
me
and
could
use
a
few
phrases
the
schoolmaster
paused
and
seemed
to
hesitate
then
as
if
making
a
resolution
he
went
on
i
must
not
be
ashamed
of
the
story
of
my
wrongs
for
any
one
in
my
place
would
have
acted
the
same
as
i
did
as
i
said
it
was
a
good
beginning
but
a
few
days
afterwards
padre
damaso
who
was
the
curate
then
sent
for
me
by
the
senior
sacristan
knowing
his
disposition
and
fearing
to
make
him
wait
i
went
upstairs
at
once
saluted
him
and
wished
him
in
spanish
his
only
greeting
had
been
to
put
out
his
hand
for
me
to
kiss
but
at
this
he
drew
it
back
and
without
answering
me
began
to
laugh
loud
and
mockingly
i
was
very
much
embarrassed
as
the
senior
sacristan
was
present
at
the
moment
i
did
know
just
what
to
say
for
the
curate
continued
his
laughter
and
i
stood
staring
at
him
then
i
began
to
get
impatient
and
saw
that
i
was
about
to
do
something
indiscreet
since
to
be
a
good
christian
and
to
preserve
dignity
are
not
incompatible
i
was
going
to
put
a
question
to
him
when
suddenly
passing
from
ridicule
to
insult
he
said
sarcastically
it
dins
eh
buenos
dias
how
nice
that
you
know
how
to
talk
spanish
then
again
he
broke
out
into
laughter
ibarra
was
unable
to
repress
a
smile
you
smile
continued
the
schoolmaster
following
ibarra
example
but
i
must
confess
that
at
the
time
i
had
very
little
desire
to
laugh
i
was
still
standing
i
felt
the
blood
rush
to
my
head
and
lightning
seemed
to
flash
through
my
brain
the
curate
i
saw
far
far
away
i
advanced
to
reply
to
him
without
knowing
just
what
i
was
going
to
say
but
the
senior
sacristan
put
himself
between
us
padre
damaso
arose
and
said
to
me
in
tagalog
try
to
shine
in
borrowed
finery
be
content
to
talk
your
own
dialect
and
do
spoil
spanish
which
is
meant
for
you
do
you
know
the
teacher
ciruela
well
ciruela
was
a
teacher
who
did
know
how
to
read
and
he
had
a
school
i
wanted
to
detain
him
but
he
went
into
his
bedroom
and
slammed
the
door
what
was
i
to
do
with
only
my
meager
salary
to
collect
which
i
have
to
get
the
curate
approval
and
make
a
trip
to
the
capital
of
the
province
what
could
i
do
against
him
the
foremost
religious
and
political
power
in
the
town
backed
up
by
his
order
feared
by
the
government
rich
powerful
sought
after
and
listened
to
always
believed
and
heeded
by
everybody
although
he
insulted
me
i
had
to
remain
silent
for
if
i
replied
he
would
have
had
me
removed
from
my
position
by
which
i
should
lose
all
hope
in
my
chosen
profession
nor
would
the
cause
of
education
gain
anything
but
the
opposite
for
everybody
would
take
the
curate
side
they
would
curse
me
and
call
me
presumptuous
proud
vain
a
bad
christian
uncultured
and
if
not
those
things
then
and
a
filibuster
of
a
schoolmaster
neither
learning
nor
zeal
is
expected
resignation
humility
and
inaction
only
are
asked
may
god
pardon
me
if
i
have
gone
against
my
conscience
and
my
judgement
but
i
was
born
in
this
country
i
have
to
live
i
have
a
mother
so
i
have
abandoned
myself
to
my
fate
like
a
corpse
tossed
about
by
the
waves
did
this
difficulty
discourage
you
for
all
time
have
you
lived
so
since
would
that
it
had
been
a
warning
to
me
if
only
my
troubles
had
been
limited
to
that
it
is
true
that
from
that
time
i
began
to
dislike
my
profession
and
thought
of
seeking
some
other
occupation
as
my
predecessor
had
done
because
any
work
that
is
done
in
disgust
and
shame
is
a
kind
of
martyrdom
and
because
every
day
the
school
recalled
the
insult
to
my
mind
causing
me
hours
of
great
bitterness
but
what
was
i
to
do
i
could
not
undeceive
my
mother
i
had
to
say
to
her
that
her
three
years
of
sacrifice
to
give
me
this
profession
now
constituted
my
happiness
it
is
necessary
to
make
her
believe
that
this
profession
is
most
honorable
the
work
delightful
the
way
strewn
with
flowers
that
the
performance
of
my
duties
brings
me
only
friendship
that
the
people
respect
me
and
show
me
every
consideration
by
doing
otherwise
without
ceasing
to
be
unhappy
myself
i
should
have
caused
more
sorrow
which
besides
being
useless
would
also
be
a
sin
i
stayed
on
therefore
and
tried
not
to
feel
discouraged
i
tried
to
struggle
on
here
he
paused
for
a
while
then
resumed
from
the
day
on
which
i
was
so
grossly
insulted
i
began
to
examine
myself
and
i
found
that
i
was
in
fact
very
ignorant
i
applied
myself
day
and
night
to
the
study
of
spanish
and
whatever
concerned
my
profession
the
old
sage
lent
me
some
books
and
i
read
and
pondered
over
everything
that
i
could
get
hold
of
with
the
new
ideas
that
i
have
been
acquiring
in
one
place
and
another
my
point
of
view
has
changed
and
i
have
seen
many
things
under
a
different
aspect
from
what
they
had
appeared
to
me
before
i
saw
error
where
before
i
had
seen
only
truth
and
truth
in
many
things
where
i
had
formerly
seen
only
error
corporal
punishment
for
example
which
from
time
immemorial
has
been
the
distinctive
feature
in
the
schools
and
which
has
heretofore
been
considered
as
the
only
efficacious
means
of
making
pupils
learn
so
we
have
been
accustomed
to
believe
soon
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
great
hindrance
rather
than
in
any
way
an
aid
to
the
child
progress
i
became
convinced
that
it
was
impossible
to
use
one
mind
properly
when
blows
or
similar
punishment
were
in
prospect
fear
and
terror
disturb
the
most
serene
and
a
child
imagination
besides
being
very
lively
is
also
very
impressionable
as
it
is
on
the
brain
that
ideas
are
impressed
it
is
necessary
that
there
be
both
inner
and
outer
calm
that
there
be
serenity
of
spirit
physical
and
moral
repose
and
willingness
so
i
thought
that
before
everything
else
i
should
cultivate
in
the
children
confidence
assurance
and
some
personal
pride
moreover
i
comprehended
that
the
daily
sight
of
floggings
destroyed
kindness
in
their
hearts
and
deadened
all
sense
of
dignity
which
is
such
a
powerful
lever
in
the
world
at
the
same
time
it
caused
them
to
lose
their
sense
of
shame
which
is
a
difficult
thing
to
restore
i
have
also
observed
that
when
one
pupil
is
flogged
he
gets
comfort
from
the
fact
that
the
others
are
treated
in
the
same
way
and
that
he
smiles
with
satisfaction
upon
hearing
the
wails
of
the
others
as
for
the
person
who
does
the
flogging
while
at
first
he
may
do
it
with
repugnance
he
soon
becomes
hardened
to
it
and
even
takes
delight
in
his
gloomy
task
the
past
filled
me
with
horror
so
i
wanted
to
save
the
present
by
modifying
the
old
system
i
endeavored
to
make
study
a
thing
of
love
and
joy
i
wished
to
make
the
primer
not
a
black
book
bathed
in
the
tears
of
childhood
but
a
friend
who
was
going
to
reveal
wonderful
secrets
and
of
the
schoolroom
not
a
place
of
sorrows
but
a
scene
of
intellectual
refreshment
so
little
by
little
i
abolished
corporal
punishment
taking
the
instruments
of
it
entirely
away
from
the
school
and
replacing
them
with
emulation
and
personal
pride
if
one
was
careless
about
his
lesson
i
charged
it
to
lack
of
desire
and
never
to
lack
of
capacity
i
made
them
think
that
they
were
more
capable
than
they
really
were
which
urged
them
on
to
study
just
as
any
confidence
leads
to
notable
achievements
at
first
it
seemed
that
the
change
of
method
was
impracticable
many
ceased
their
studies
but
i
persisted
and
observed
that
little
by
little
their
minds
were
being
elevated
and
that
more
children
came
that
they
came
with
more
regularity
and
that
he
who
was
praised
in
the
presence
of
the
others
studied
with
double
diligence
on
the
next
day
it
soon
became
known
throughout
the
town
that
i
did
not
whip
the
children
the
curate
sent
for
me
and
fearing
another
scene
i
greeted
him
curtly
in
tagalog
on
this
occasion
he
was
very
serious
with
me
he
said
that
i
was
exposing
the
children
to
destruction
that
i
was
wasting
time
that
i
was
not
fulfilling
my
duties
that
the
father
who
spared
the
rod
was
spoiling
the
child
according
to
the
holy
ghost
that
learning
enters
with
blood
and
so
on
he
quoted
to
me
sayings
of
barbarous
times
just
as
if
it
were
enough
that
a
thing
had
been
said
by
the
ancients
to
make
it
indisputable
according
to
which
we
ought
to
believe
that
there
really
existed
those
monsters
which
in
past
ages
were
imaged
and
sculptured
in
the
palaces
and
temples
finally
he
charged
me
to
be
more
careful
and
to
return
to
the
old
system
otherwise
he
would
make
unfavorable
report
about
me
to
the
alcalde
of
the
province
nor
was
this
the
end
of
my
troubles
a
few
days
afterward
some
of
the
parents
of
the
children
presented
themselves
under
the
convento
and
i
had
to
call
to
my
aid
all
my
patience
and
resignation
they
began
by
reminding
me
of
former
times
when
teachers
had
character
and
taught
as
their
grandfathers
had
indeed
were
the
times
of
the
wise
men
they
declared
whipped
and
straightened
the
bent
tree
they
were
not
boys
but
old
men
of
experience
and
severe
don
catalino
king
of
them
all
and
founder
of
this
very
school
used
to
administer
no
less
than
blows
and
as
a
result
his
pupils
became
wise
men
and
priests
ah
the
old
people
were
worth
more
than
we
ourselves
yes
sir
more
than
we
ourselves
some
did
not
content
themselves
with
such
indirect
rudeness
but
told
me
plainly
that
if
i
continued
my
system
their
children
would
learn
nothing
and
that
they
would
be
obliged
to
take
them
from
the
school
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
them
for
as
a
young
man
they
thought
me
incapable
of
sound
judgment
what
would
i
not
have
given
for
some
gray
hairs
they
cited
the
authority
of
the
curate
of
this
one
and
that
one
and
even
called
attention
to
themselves
saying
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
whippings
they
had
received
from
their
teachers
they
would
never
have
learned
anything
only
a
few
persons
showed
any
sympathy
to
sweeten
for
me
the
bitterness
of
such
a
disillusioning
in
view
of
all
this
i
had
to
give
up
my
system
which
after
so
much
toil
was
just
beginning
to
produce
results
in
desperation
i
carried
the
whips
bank
to
the
school
the
next
day
and
began
the
barbarous
practice
again
serenity
disappeared
and
sadness
reigned
in
the
faces
of
the
children
who
had
just
begun
to
care
for
me
and
who
were
my
only
kindred
and
friends
although
i
tried
to
spare
the
whippings
and
to
administer
them
with
all
the
moderation
possible
yet
the
children
felt
the
change
keenly
they
became
discouraged
and
wept
bitterly
it
touched
my
heart
and
even
though
in
my
own
mind
i
was
vexed
with
the
stupid
parents
still
i
was
unable
to
take
any
spite
out
on
those
innocent
victims
of
their
parents
prejudices
their
tears
burned
me
my
heart
seemed
bursting
from
my
breast
and
that
day
i
left
the
school
before
to
go
home
and
weep
alone
perhaps
my
sensitiveness
may
seem
strange
to
you
but
if
you
had
been
in
my
place
you
would
understand
it
old
don
anastasio
said
to
me
the
parents
want
floggings
why
not
inflict
them
on
themselves
as
a
result
of
it
all
i
became
sick
ibarra
was
listening
thoughtfully
scarcely
had
i
recovered
when
i
returned
to
the
school
to
find
the
number
of
my
pupils
reduced
to
a
fifth
the
better
ones
had
run
away
upon
the
return
to
the
old
system
and
of
those
who
remained
mostly
those
who
came
to
school
to
escape
work
at
home
not
one
showed
any
joy
not
one
congratulated
me
on
my
recovery
it
would
have
been
the
same
to
them
whether
i
got
well
or
not
or
they
might
have
preferred
that
i
continue
sick
since
my
substitute
although
he
whipped
them
more
rarely
went
to
the
school
my
other
pupils
those
whose
parents
had
obliged
them
to
attend
school
had
gone
to
other
places
their
parents
blamed
me
for
having
spoiled
them
and
heaped
reproaches
on
me
for
it
one
however
the
son
of
a
country
woman
who
visited
me
during
my
illness
had
not
returned
on
account
of
having
been
made
a
sacristan
and
the
senior
sacristan
says
that
the
sacristans
must
not
attend
school
they
would
be
dismissed
were
you
resigned
in
looking
after
your
new
pupils
asked
ibarra
what
else
could
i
do
was
the
queried
reply
nevertheless
during
my
illness
many
things
had
happened
among
them
a
change
of
curates
so
i
took
new
hope
and
made
another
attempt
to
the
end
that
the
children
should
not
lose
all
their
time
and
should
in
so
far
as
possible
get
some
benefit
from
the
floggings
that
such
things
might
at
least
have
some
good
result
for
them
i
pondered
over
the
matter
as
i
wished
that
even
if
they
could
not
love
me
by
getting
something
useful
from
me
they
might
remember
me
with
less
bitterness
you
know
that
in
nearly
all
the
schools
the
books
are
in
spanish
with
the
exception
of
the
catechism
in
tagalog
which
varies
according
to
the
religious
order
to
which
the
curate
belongs
these
books
are
generally
novenas
canticles
and
the
catechism
of
padre
astete
from
which
they
learn
about
as
much
piety
as
they
would
from
the
books
of
heretics
seeing
the
impossibility
of
teaching
the
pupils
in
spanish
or
of
translating
so
many
books
i
tried
to
substitute
short
passages
from
useful
works
in
tagalog
such
as
the
treatise
on
manners
by
hortensio
y
feliza
some
manuals
of
agriculture
and
so
forth
sometimes
i
would
myself
translate
simple
works
such
as
padre
barranera
history
of
the
philippines
which
i
then
dictated
to
the
children
with
at
times
a
few
observations
of
my
own
so
that
they
might
make
as
i
had
no
maps
for
teaching
geography
i
copied
one
of
the
province
that
i
saw
at
the
capital
and
with
this
and
the
tiles
of
the
floor
i
gave
them
some
idea
of
the
country
this
time
it
was
the
women
who
got
excited
the
men
contented
themselves
with
smiling
as
they
saw
in
it
only
one
of
my
vagaries
the
new
curate
sent
for
me
and
while
he
did
not
reprimand
me
yet
he
said
that
i
should
first
take
care
of
religion
that
before
learning
such
things
the
children
must
pass
an
examination
to
show
that
they
had
memorized
the
mysteries
the
canticles
and
the
catechism
of
christian
doctrine
so
then
i
am
now
working
to
the
end
that
the
children
become
changed
into
parrots
and
know
by
heart
so
many
things
of
which
they
do
not
understand
a
single
word
many
of
them
now
know
the
mysteries
and
the
canticles
but
i
fear
that
my
efforts
will
come
to
grief
with
the
catechism
of
padre
astete
since
the
greater
part
of
the
pupils
do
not
distinguish
between
the
questions
and
the
answers
nor
do
they
understand
what
either
may
mean
thus
we
shall
die
thus
those
unborn
will
do
while
in
europe
they
will
talk
of
progress
let
not
be
so
pessimistic
said
ibarra
the
has
sent
me
an
invitation
to
attend
a
meeting
in
the
town
hall
who
knows
but
that
there
you
may
find
an
answer
to
your
questions
the
schoolmaster
shook
his
head
in
doubt
as
he
answered
you
see
how
the
plan
of
which
they
talked
to
me
meets
the
same
fate
as
mine
has
but
yet
let
us
see
chapter
xx
the
meeting
in
the
town
hall
the
hall
was
about
twelve
to
fifteen
meters
long
by
eight
to
ten
wide
its
whitewashed
walls
were
covered
with
drawings
in
charcoal
more
or
less
ugly
and
obscene
with
inscriptions
to
complete
their
meanings
stacked
neatly
against
the
wall
in
one
corner
were
to
be
seen
about
a
dozen
old
among
rusty
swords
and
talibons
the
armament
of
the
cuadrilleros
at
one
end
of
the
hall
there
hung
half
hidden
by
soiled
red
curtains
a
picture
of
his
majesty
the
king
of
spain
underneath
this
picture
upon
a
wooden
platform
an
old
chair
spread
out
its
broken
arms
in
front
of
the
chair
was
a
wooden
table
spotted
with
ink
stains
and
whittled
and
carved
with
inscriptions
and
initials
like
the
tables
in
the
german
taverns
frequented
by
students
benches
and
broken
chairs
completed
the
furniture
this
is
the
hall
of
council
of
judgment
and
of
torture
wherein
are
now
gathered
the
officials
of
the
town
and
its
dependent
villages
the
faction
of
old
men
does
not
mix
with
that
of
the
youths
for
they
are
mutually
hostile
they
represent
respectively
the
conservative
and
the
liberal
parties
save
that
their
disputes
assume
in
the
towns
an
extreme
character
the
conduct
of
the
gobernadorcillo
fills
me
with
distrust
don
filipo
the
and
leader
of
the
liberal
faction
was
saying
to
his
friends
it
was
a
scheme
this
thing
of
putting
off
the
discussion
of
expenses
until
the
eleventh
hour
remember
that
we
have
scarcely
eleven
days
left
and
he
has
staved
at
the
convento
to
hold
a
conference
with
the
curate
who
is
sick
observed
one
of
the
youths
it
does
matter
remarked
another
we
have
everything
prepared
just
so
the
plan
of
the
old
men
does
receive
a
majority
i
do
believe
it
will
interrupted
don
filipo
as
i
shall
present
the
plan
of
the
old
men
myself
what
what
are
you
saying
asked
his
surprised
hearers
i
said
that
if
i
speak
first
i
shall
present
the
plan
of
our
rivals
but
what
about
our
plan
i
shall
leave
it
to
you
to
present
ours
answered
don
filipo
with
a
smile
turning
toward
a
youthful
cabeza
de
barangay
you
will
propose
it
after
i
have
been
defeated
we
do
understand
you
sir
said
his
hearers
staring
at
him
with
doubtful
looks
listen
continued
the
liberal
leader
in
a
low
voice
to
several
near
him
this
morning
i
met
old
tasio
and
the
old
man
said
to
me
rivals
hate
you
more
than
they
do
your
ideas
do
you
wish
that
a
thing
shall
not
be
done
then
propose
it
yourself
and
though
it
were
more
useful
than
a
miter
it
would
be
rejected
once
they
have
defeated
you
have
the
least
forward
person
in
the
whole
gathering
propose
what
you
want
and
your
rivals
in
order
to
humiliate
you
will
accept
it
but
keep
quiet
about
it
but
so
i
will
propose
the
plan
of
our
rivals
and
exaggerate
it
to
the
point
of
making
it
ridiculous
ah
here
come
señor
ibarra
and
the
schoolmaster
these
two
young
men
saluted
each
of
the
groups
without
joining
either
a
few
moments
later
the
gobernadorcillo
the
very
same
individual
whom
we
saw
yesterday
carrying
a
bundle
of
candles
entered
with
a
look
of
disgust
on
his
face
upon
his
entrance
the
murmurs
ceased
every
one
sat
down
and
silence
was
gradually
established
as
he
took
his
seat
under
the
picture
of
the
king
coughed
four
or
five
times
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
face
and
head
rested
his
elbows
on
the
table
then
withdrew
them
coughed
once
more
and
then
the
whole
thing
over
again
gentlemen
he
at
last
began
in
an
unsteady
voice
i
have
been
so
bold
as
to
call
you
together
here
for
this
meeting
ahem
ahem
we
have
to
celebrate
the
fiesta
of
our
patron
saint
san
diego
on
the
twelfth
of
this
month
ahem
today
is
the
second
ahem
ahem
at
this
point
a
slow
dry
cough
cut
off
his
speech
a
man
of
proud
bearing
apparently
about
forty
years
of
age
then
arose
from
the
bench
of
the
elders
he
was
the
rich
capitan
basilio
the
direct
contrast
of
don
rafael
ibarra
father
he
was
a
man
who
maintained
that
after
the
death
of
thomas
aquinas
the
world
had
made
no
more
progress
and
that
since
john
lateran
had
left
it
humanity
had
been
retrograding
gentlemen
allow
me
to
speak
a
few
words
about
such
an
interesting
matter
he
began
i
speak
first
even
though
there
are
others
here
present
who
have
more
right
to
do
so
than
i
have
but
i
speak
first
because
in
these
matters
it
seems
to
me
that
by
speaking
first
one
does
not
take
the
first
place
no
more
than
that
by
speaking
last
does
one
become
the
least
besides
the
things
that
i
have
to
say
are
of
such
importance
that
they
should
not
be
put
off
or
last
spoken
of
and
accordingly
i
wish
to
speak
first
in
order
to
give
them
due
weight
so
you
will
allow
me
to
speak
first
in
this
meeting
where
i
see
so
many
notable
persons
such
as
the
present
señor
capitan
the
former
capitan
my
distinguished
friend
don
valentin
a
former
capitan
the
friend
of
my
infancy
don
julio
our
celebrated
captain
of
cuadrilleros
don
melchor
and
many
other
personages
whom
for
the
sake
of
brevity
i
must
omit
to
enumerate
all
of
whom
you
see
present
here
i
beg
of
you
that
i
may
be
allowed
a
few
words
before
any
one
else
speaks
have
i
the
good
fortune
to
see
my
humble
request
granted
by
the
meeting
here
the
orator
with
a
faint
smile
inclined
his
head
respectfully
go
on
you
have
our
undivided
attention
said
the
notables
alluded
to
and
some
others
who
considered
capitan
basilio
a
great
orator
the
elders
coughed
in
a
satisfied
way
and
rubbed
their
hands
after
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
with
a
silk
handkerchief
he
then
proceeded
now
that
you
have
been
so
kind
and
complaisant
with
my
humble
self
as
to
grant
me
the
use
of
a
few
words
before
any
one
else
of
those
here
present
i
shall
take
advantage
of
this
permission
so
generously
granted
and
shall
talk
in
imagination
i
fancy
myself
in
the
midst
of
the
august
roman
senate
populusque
as
was
said
in
those
happy
days
which
unfortunately
for
humanity
will
nevermore
return
i
propose
to
the
as
the
learned
cicero
would
say
if
he
were
in
my
place
i
propose
in
view
of
the
short
time
left
and
time
is
money
as
solomon
said
that
concerning
this
important
matter
each
one
set
forth
his
opinion
clearly
briefly
and
simply
satisfied
with
himself
and
flattered
by
the
attention
in
the
hall
the
orator
took
his
seat
not
without
first
casting
a
glance
of
superiority
toward
ibarra
who
was
seated
in
a
corner
and
a
significant
look
at
his
friends
as
if
to
say
aha
have
i
spoken
well
his
friends
reflected
both
of
these
expressions
by
staring
at
the
youths
as
though
to
make
them
die
of
envy
now
any
one
may
speak
who
wishes
that
ahem
began
the
gobernadorcillo
but
a
repetition
of
the
cough
and
sighs
cut
short
the
phrase
to
judge
from
the
silence
no
one
wished
to
consider
himself
called
upon
as
one
of
the
conscript
fathers
since
no
one
rose
then
don
filipo
seized
the
opportunity
and
rose
to
speak
the
conservatives
winked
and
made
significant
signs
to
each
other
i
rise
gentlemen
to
present
my
estimate
of
expenses
for
the
fiesta
he
began
we
ca
allow
it
commented
a
consumptive
old
man
who
was
an
irreconcilable
conservative
we
vote
against
it
corroborated
others
gentlemen
exclaimed
don
filipo
repressing
a
smile
i
have
yet
made
known
the
plan
which
we
younger
bring
here
we
feel
that
this
great
plan
will
be
preferred
by
all
over
any
other
that
our
opponents
think
of
or
are
capable
of
conceiving
this
presumptuous
exordium
so
thoroughly
irritated
the
minds
of
the
conservatives
that
they
swore
in
their
hearts
to
offer
determined
opposition
we
have
estimated
three
thousand
five
hundred
pesos
for
the
expenses
went
on
don
filipo
now
then
with
such
a
sum
we
shall
be
able
to
celebrate
a
fiesta
that
will
eclipse
in
magnificence
any
that
has
been
seen
up
to
this
time
in
our
own
or
neighboring
provinces
ahem
coughed
some
doubters
the
town
of
a
has
five
thousand
b
has
four
thousand
ahem
humbug
listen
to
me
gentlemen
and
i
convince
you
continued
the
unterrified
speaker
i
propose
that
we
erect
a
theater
in
the
middle
of
the
plaza
to
cost
one
hundred
and
fifty
pesos
that
wo
be
enough
it
take
one
hundred
and
sixty
objected
a
confirmed
conservative
write
it
down
señor
director
two
hundred
pesos
for
the
theater
said
don
filipo
i
further
propose
that
we
contract
with
a
troupe
of
comedians
from
tondo
for
seven
performances
on
seven
successive
nights
seven
performances
at
two
hundred
pesos
a
night
make
fourteen
hundred
pesos
write
down
fourteen
hundred
pesos
señor
director
both
the
elders
and
the
youths
stared
in
amazement
only
those
in
the
secret
gave
no
sign
i
propose
besides
that
we
have
magnificent
fireworks
no
little
lights
and
such
as
please
children
and
old
maids
nothing
of
the
sort
we
want
big
bombs
and
immense
rockets
i
propose
two
hundred
big
bombs
at
two
pesos
each
and
two
hundred
rockets
at
the
same
price
we
have
them
made
by
the
pyrotechnists
of
malabon
huh
grunted
an
old
man
a
bomb
does
frighten
or
deafen
me
they
ought
to
be
ones
write
down
one
thousand
pesos
for
two
hundred
bombs
and
two
hundred
rockets
the
conservatives
could
no
longer
restrain
themselves
some
of
them
rose
and
began
to
whisper
together
moreover
in
order
that
our
visitors
may
see
that
we
are
a
liberal
people
and
have
plenty
of
money
continued
the
speaker
raising
his
voice
and
casting
a
rapid
glance
at
the
whispering
group
of
elders
i
propose
first
four
for
the
two
days
of
the
fiesta
and
second
that
each
day
there
be
thrown
into
the
lake
two
hundred
fried
chickens
one
hundred
stuffed
capons
and
forty
roast
pigs
as
did
sylla
a
contemporary
of
that
cicero
of
whom
capitan
basilio
just
spoke
that
it
like
sylla
repeated
the
flattered
capitan
basilio
the
surprise
steadily
increased
since
many
rich
people
will
attend
and
each
one
will
bring
thousands
of
pesos
his
best
and
his
i
propose
that
the
cockpit
run
for
fifteen
days
and
that
license
be
granted
to
open
all
gambling
houses
the
youths
interrupted
him
by
rising
thinking
that
he
had
gone
crazy
the
elders
were
arguing
heatedly
and
finally
that
we
may
not
neglect
the
pleasures
of
the
soul
the
murmurs
and
cries
which
arose
all
over
the
hall
drowned
his
voice
out
completely
and
tumult
reigned
no
yelled
an
irreconcilable
conservative
i
do
want
him
to
flatter
himself
over
having
run
the
whole
fiesta
no
let
me
speak
let
me
speak
don
filipo
has
deceived
us
cried
the
liberals
we
vote
against
his
plan
he
has
gone
over
to
the
old
men
we
vote
against
him
the
gobernadorcillo
more
overwhelmed
than
ever
did
nothing
to
restore
order
but
rather
was
waiting
for
them
to
restore
it
themselves
the
captain
of
the
cuadrilleros
begged
to
be
heard
and
was
granted
permission
to
speak
but
he
did
not
open
his
mouth
and
sat
down
again
confused
and
ashamed
by
good
fortune
capitan
valentin
the
most
moderate
of
all
the
conservatives
arose
and
said
we
can
not
agree
to
what
the
has
proposed
as
it
appears
to
be
exaggerated
so
many
bombs
and
so
many
nights
of
theatrical
performances
can
only
be
desired
by
a
young
man
such
as
he
is
who
can
spend
night
after
night
sitting
up
and
listening
to
so
many
explosions
without
becoming
deaf
i
have
consulted
the
opinion
of
the
sensible
persons
here
and
all
of
them
unanimously
disapprove
don
filipo
plan
is
it
not
so
gentlemen
yes
yes
cried
the
youths
and
elders
with
one
voice
the
youths
were
delighted
to
hear
an
old
man
speak
so
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
four
mayores
went
on
the
old
man
what
is
the
meaning
of
those
chickens
capons
and
roast
pigs
thrown
into
the
lake
our
neighbors
would
say
and
afterwards
we
should
have
to
fast
for
six
months
what
have
we
to
do
with
sylla
and
the
romans
have
they
ever
invited
us
to
any
of
their
festivities
i
wonder
i
at
least
have
never
received
any
invitation
from
them
and
you
can
all
see
that
i
an
old
man
the
romans
live
in
rome
where
the
pope
is
capitan
basilio
prompted
him
in
a
low
voice
now
i
understand
exclaimed
the
old
man
calmly
they
would
make
of
their
festivals
and
the
pope
would
order
them
to
throw
their
food
into
the
sea
so
that
they
might
commit
no
sin
but
in
spite
of
all
that
your
plan
is
inadmissible
impossible
a
piece
of
foolishness
being
so
stoutly
opposed
don
filipo
had
to
withdraw
his
proposal
now
that
their
chief
rival
had
been
defeated
even
the
worst
of
the
irreconcilable
insurgents
looked
on
with
calmness
while
a
young
cabeza
de
barangay
asked
for
the
floor
i
beg
that
you
excuse
the
boldness
of
one
so
young
as
i
am
in
daring
to
speak
before
so
many
persons
respected
for
their
age
and
prudence
and
judgment
in
affairs
but
since
the
eloquent
orator
capitan
basilio
has
requested
every
one
to
express
his
opinion
let
the
authoritative
words
spoken
by
him
excuse
my
insignificance
the
conservatives
nodded
their
heads
with
satisfaction
remarking
to
one
another
this
young
man
talks
sensibly
he
modest
he
reasons
admirably
what
a
pity
that
he
does
know
very
well
how
to
gesticulate
observed
capitan
basilio
but
there
time
yet
he
has
studied
cicero
and
he
still
a
young
man
if
i
present
to
you
gentlemen
any
program
or
plan
the
young
man
continued
i
do
do
so
with
the
thought
that
you
will
find
it
perfect
or
that
you
will
accept
it
but
at
the
same
time
that
i
once
more
bow
to
the
judgment
of
all
of
you
i
wish
to
prove
to
our
elders
that
our
thoughts
are
always
like
theirs
since
we
take
as
our
own
those
ideas
so
eloquently
expressed
by
capitan
basilio
well
spoken
well
spoken
cried
the
flattered
conservatives
capitan
basilio
made
signs
to
the
speaker
showing
him
how
he
should
stand
and
how
he
ought
to
move
his
arm
the
only
one
remaining
impassive
was
the
gobernadorcillo
who
was
either
bewildered
or
preoccupied
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
seemed
to
be
both
the
young
man
went
on
with
more
warmth
my
plan
gentlemen
reduces
itself
to
this
invent
new
shows
that
are
not
common
and
ordinary
such
as
we
see
every
day
and
endeavor
that
the
money
collected
may
not
leave
the
town
and
that
it
be
not
wasted
in
smoke
but
that
it
be
used
in
some
manner
beneficial
to
all
that
right
assented
the
youths
that
what
we
want
excellent
added
the
elders
what
should
we
get
from
a
week
of
comedies
as
the
proposes
what
can
we
learn
from
the
kings
of
bohemia
and
granada
who
commanded
that
their
daughters
heads
be
cut
off
or
that
they
should
be
blown
from
a
cannon
which
later
is
converted
into
a
throne
we
are
not
kings
neither
are
we
barbarians
we
have
no
cannon
and
if
we
should
imitate
those
people
they
would
hang
us
on
bagumbayan
what
are
those
princesses
who
mingle
in
the
battles
scattering
thrusts
and
blows
about
in
combat
with
princes
or
who
wander
alone
over
mountains
and
through
valleys
as
though
seduced
by
the
our
nature
is
to
love
sweetness
and
tenderness
in
woman
and
we
would
shudder
at
the
thought
of
taking
the
hand
of
a
maiden
even
when
the
blood
was
that
of
a
moro
or
a
giant
so
abhorred
by
us
we
consider
vile
the
man
who
raises
his
hand
against
a
woman
be
he
prince
or
alferez
or
rude
countryman
would
it
not
be
a
thousand
times
better
to
give
a
representation
of
our
own
customs
in
order
to
correct
our
defects
and
vices
and
to
encourage
our
better
qualities
that
right
that
right
exclaimed
some
of
his
faction
he
right
muttered
several
old
men
thoughtfully
i
should
never
have
thought
of
that
murmured
capitan
basilio
but
how
are
you
going
to
do
it
asked
the
irreconcilable
very
easily
answered
the
youth
i
have
brought
here
two
dramas
which
i
feel
sure
the
good
taste
and
recognized
judgment
of
the
respected
elders
here
assembled
will
find
very
agreeable
and
entertaining
one
is
entitled
election
of
the
gobernadorcillo
being
a
comedy
in
prose
in
five
acts
written
by
one
who
is
here
present
the
other
is
in
nine
acts
for
two
nights
and
is
a
fantastical
drama
of
a
satirical
nature
entitled
makiling
written
by
one
of
the
best
poets
of
the
province
seeing
that
the
discussion
of
preparations
for
the
fiesta
has
been
postponed
and
fearing
that
there
would
not
be
time
enough
left
we
have
secretly
secured
the
actors
and
had
them
learn
their
parts
we
hope
that
with
a
week
of
rehearsal
they
will
have
plenty
of
time
to
know
their
parts
thoroughly
this
gentlemen
besides
being
new
useful
and
reasonable
has
the
great
advantage
of
being
economical
we
shall
not
need
costumes
as
those
of
our
daily
life
will
be
suitable
i
pay
for
the
theater
shouted
capitan
basilio
enthusiastically
if
you
need
cuadrilleros
i
lend
you
mine
cried
their
captain
and
i
and
i
if
art
old
man
is
needed
stammered
another
one
swelling
with
pride
accepted
accepted
cried
many
voices
don
filipo
became
pale
with
emotion
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
crying
from
spite
thought
the
irreconcilable
so
he
yelled
accepted
accepted
without
discussion
thus
satisfied
with
revenge
and
the
complete
defeat
of
his
rival
this
fellow
began
to
praise
the
young
man
plan
the
latter
continued
his
speech
a
fifth
of
the
money
collected
may
be
used
to
distribute
a
few
prizes
such
as
to
the
best
school
child
the
best
herdsman
farmer
fisherman
and
so
on
we
can
arrange
for
boat
races
on
the
river
and
lake
and
for
horse
races
on
shore
we
can
raise
greased
poles
and
also
have
other
games
in
which
our
country
people
can
take
part
i
concede
that
on
account
of
our
customs
we
must
have
some
fireworks
wheels
and
fire
castles
are
very
beautiful
and
entertaining
but
i
do
believe
it
necessary
to
have
bombs
as
the
former
speaker
proposed
two
bands
of
music
will
afford
sufficient
merriment
and
thus
we
shall
avoid
those
rivalries
and
quarrels
between
the
poor
musicians
who
come
to
gladden
our
fiesta
with
their
work
and
who
so
often
behave
like
afterwards
going
away
poorly
paid
underfed
and
even
bruised
and
wounded
at
times
with
the
money
left
over
we
can
begin
the
erection
of
a
small
building
for
a
schoolhouse
since
we
ca
wait
until
god
himself
comes
down
and
builds
one
for
us
and
it
is
a
sad
state
of
affairs
that
while
we
have
a
fine
cockpit
our
children
study
almost
in
the
curate
stable
such
are
the
outlines
of
my
plan
the
details
can
be
worked
out
by
all
a
murmur
of
pleasure
ran
through
the
hall
as
nearly
every
one
agreed
with
the
youth
some
few
muttered
innovations
innovations
when
we
were
young
let
adopt
it
for
the
time
being
and
humiliate
that
fellow
said
others
indicating
don
filipo
when
silence
was
restored
all
were
agreed
there
was
lacking
only
the
approval
of
the
gobernadorcillo
that
worthy
official
was
perspiring
and
fidgeting
about
he
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
and
was
at
length
able
to
stammer
out
in
a
weak
voice
i
also
agree
but
ahem
every
one
in
the
hall
listened
in
silence
but
what
asked
capitan
basilio
very
agreeable
repeated
the
gobernadorcillo
that
is
to
say
i
do
agree
i
mean
yes
but
here
he
rubbed
his
eyes
with
the
back
of
his
hand
but
the
curate
the
poor
fellow
went
on
the
curate
wants
something
else
does
the
curate
or
do
we
ourselves
pay
for
this
fiesta
has
he
given
a
cuarto
for
it
exclaimed
a
penetrating
voice
all
looked
toward
the
place
whence
these
questions
came
and
saw
there
the
sage
tasio
don
filipo
remained
motionless
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
gobernadorcillo
what
does
the
curate
want
asked
capitan
basilio
well
the
padre
wants
six
processions
three
sermons
three
high
masses
and
if
there
is
any
money
left
a
comedy
from
tondo
with
songs
in
the
intermissions
but
we
do
want
that
said
the
youths
and
some
of
the
old
men
the
curate
wants
it
repeated
the
gobernadorcillo
i
promised
him
that
his
wish
shall
be
carried
out
then
why
did
you
have
us
assemble
here
the
very
purpose
of
telling
you
this
why
did
you
tell
us
so
at
the
start
i
wanted
to
tell
you
gentlemen

several

several
other
old

the

the

approached
this
official
and
said
to
him
bitterly

sacrificing
your
dignity

in

of

and
asked

ibarra
mysteriously
on
the
way

bad

to
him

chapter

the
story
of
a
mother
andaba
incierto
volaba
errante
un
solo

sin
descansar
alaejos
sisa
ran
in
the
direction
of
her
home
with
her
thoughts
in
that
confused
whirl
which
is
produced
in
our
being
when
in
the
midst
of
misfortunes
protection
and
hope
alike
are
gone
it
is
then
that
everything
seems
to
grow
dark
around
us
and
if
we
do
see
some
faint
light
shining
from
afar
we
run
toward
it
we
follow
it
even
though
an
abyss
yawns
in
our
path
the
mother
wanted
to
save
her
sons
and
mothers
do
not
ask
about
means
when
their
children
are
concerned
precipitately
she
ran
pursued
by
fear
and
dark
forebodings
had
they
already
arrested
her
son
basilio
whither
had
her
boy
crispin
fled
as
she
approached
her
little
hut
she
made
out
above
the
garden
fence
the
caps
of
two
soldiers
it
would
be
impossible
to
tell
what
her
heart
felt
she
forgot
everything
she
was
not
ignorant
of
the
boldness
of
those
men
who
did
not
lower
their
gaze
before
even
the
richest
people
of
the
town
what
would
they
do
now
to
her
and
to
her
sons
accused
of
theft
the
are
not
men
they
are
they
do
not
listen
to
supplications
and
they
are
accustomed
to
see
tears
sisa
instinctively
raised
her
eyes
toward
the
sky
that
sky
which
smiled
with
brilliance
indescribable
and
in
whose
transparent
blue
floated
some
little
fleecy
clouds
she
stopped
to
control
the
trembling
that
had
seized
her
whole
body
the
soldiers
were
leaving
the
house
and
were
alone
as
they
had
arrested
nothing
more
than
the
hen
which
sisa
had
been
fattening
she
breathed
more
freely
and
took
heart
again
how
good
they
are
and
what
kind
hearts
they
have
she
murmured
almost
weeping
with
joy
had
the
soldiers
burned
her
house
but
left
her
sons
at
liberty
she
would
have
heaped
blessings
upon
them
she
again
looked
gratefully
toward
the
sky
through
which
a
flock
of
herons
those
light
clouds
in
the
skies
of
the
philippines
were
cutting
their
path
and
with
restored
confidence
she
continued
on
her
way
as
she
approached
those
fearful
men
she
threw
her
glances
in
every
direction
as
if
unconcerned
and
pretended
not
to
see
her
hen
which
was
cackling
for
help
scarcely
had
she
passed
them
when
she
wanted
to
run
but
prudence
restrained
her
steps
she
had
not
gone
far
when
she
heard
herself
called
by
an
imperious
voice
shuddering
she
pretended
not
to
hear
and
continued
on
her
way
they
called
her
again
this
time
with
a
yell
and
an
insulting
epithet
she
turned
toward
them
pale
and
trembling
in
spite
of
herself
one
of
them
beckoned
to
her
mechanically
sisa
approached
them
her
tongue
paralyzed
with
fear
and
her
throat
parched
tell
us
the
truth
or
we
tie
you
to
that
tree
and
shoot
you
said
one
of
them
in
a
threatening
tone
the
woman
stared
at
the
tree
you
the
mother
of
the
thieves
are
you
asked
the
other
mother
of
the
thieves
repeated
sisa
mechanically
where
the
money
your
sons
brought
you
last
night
ah
the
money
do
deny
it
or
it
be
the
worse
for
you
added
the
other
come
to
arrest
your
sons
and
the
older
has
escaped
from
us
where
have
you
hidden
the
younger
upon
hearing
this
sisa
breathed
more
freely
and
answered
sir
it
has
been
many
days
since
i
seen
crispin
i
expected
to
see
him
this
morning
at
the
convento
but
there
they
only
told
me
the
two
soldiers
exchanged
significant
glances
all
right
exclaimed
one
of
them
give
us
the
money
and
we
leave
you
alone
sir
begged
the
unfortunate
woman
my
sons
would
steal
even
though
they
were
starving
for
we
are
used
to
that
kind
of
suffering
basilio
did
bring
me
a
single
cuarto
search
the
whole
house
and
if
you
find
even
a
real
do
with
us
what
you
will
not
all
of
us
poor
folks
are
thieves
well
then
ordered
the
soldier
slowly
as
he
fixed
his
gaze
on
sisa
eyes
come
with
us
your
sons
will
show
up
and
try
to
get
rid
of
the
money
they
stole
come
on
i
go
with
you
murmured
the
woman
as
she
stepped
backward
and
gazed
fearfully
at
their
uniforms
and
why
not
oh
have
pity
on
me
she
begged
almost
on
her
knees
i
very
poor
so
i
neither
gold
nor
jewels
to
offer
you
the
only
thing
i
had
you
already
taken
and
that
is
the
hen
which
i
was
thinking
of
selling
take
everything
that
you
find
in
the
house
but
leave
me
here
in
peace
leave
me
here
to
die
go
ahead
you
got
to
go
and
if
you
do
move
along
willingly
we
tie
you
sisa
broke
out
into
bitter
weeping
but
those
men
were
inflexible
at
least
let
me
go
ahead
of
you
some
distance
she
begged
when
she
felt
them
take
hold
of
her
brutally
and
push
her
along
the
soldiers
seemed
to
be
somewhat
affected
and
after
whispering
apart
one
of
them
said
all
right
since
from
here
until
we
get
into
the
town
you
might
be
able
to
escape
you
walk
between
us
once
there
you
may
walk
ahead
twenty
paces
but
take
care
that
you
delay
and
that
you
do
go
into
any
shop
and
do
stop
go
ahead
quickly
vain
were
her
supplications
and
arguments
useless
her
promises
the
soldiers
said
that
they
had
already
compromised
themselves
by
having
conceded
too
much
upon
finding
herself
between
them
she
felt
as
if
she
would
die
of
shame
no
one
indeed
was
coming
along
the
road
but
how
about
the
air
and
the
light
of
day
true
shame
encounters
eyes
everywhere
she
covered
her
face
with
her
pañuelo
and
walked
along
blindly
weeping
in
silence
at
her
disgrace
she
had
felt
misery
and
knew
what
it
was
to
be
abandoned
by
every
one
even
her
own
husband
but
until
now
she
had
considered
herself
honored
and
respected
up
to
this
time
she
had
looked
with
compassion
on
those
boldly
dressed
women
whom
the
town
knew
as
the
concubines
of
the
soldiers
now
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
fallen
even
a
step
lower
than
they
in
the
social
scale
the
sound
of
hoofs
was
heard
proceeding
from
a
small
train
of
men
and
women
mounted
on
poor
nags
each
between
two
baskets
hung
over
the
back
of
his
mount
it
was
a
party
carrying
fish
to
the
interior
towns
some
of
them
on
passing
her
hut
had
often
asked
for
a
drink
of
water
and
had
presented
her
with
some
fishes
now
as
they
passed
her
they
seemed
to
beat
and
trample
upon
her
while
their
compassionate
or
disdainful
looks
penetrated
through
her
pañuelo
and
stung
her
face
when
these
travelers
had
finally
passed
she
sighed
and
raised
the
pañuelo
an
instant
to
see
how
far
she
still
was
from
the
town
there
yet
remained
a
few
telegraph
poles
to
be
passed
before
reaching
the
or
little
at
the
entrance
to
the
town
never
had
that
distance
seemed
so
great
to
her
beside
the
road
there
grew
a
leafy
bamboo
thicket
in
whose
shade
she
had
rested
at
other
times
and
where
her
lover
had
talked
so
sweetly
as
he
helped
her
carry
her
basket
of
fruit
and
vegetables
alas
all
that
was
past
like
a
dream
the
lover
had
become
her
husband
and
a
cabeza
de
barangay
and
then
trouble
had
commenced
to
knock
at
her
door
as
the
sun
was
beginning
to
shine
hotly
the
soldiers
asked
her
if
she
did
not
want
to
rest
there
thanks
no
was
the
horrified
woman
answer
real
terror
seized
her
when
they
neared
the
town
she
threw
her
anguished
gaze
in
all
directions
but
no
refuge
offered
itself
only
wide
a
small
irrigating
ditch
and
some
stunted
trees
there
was
not
a
cliff
or
even
a
rock
upon
which
she
might
dash
herself
to
pieces
now
she
regretted
that
she
had
come
so
far
with
the
soldiers
she
longed
for
the
deep
river
that
flowed
by
her
hut
whose
high
and
banks
would
have
offered
such
a
sweet
death
but
again
the
thought
of
her
sons
especially
of
crispin
of
whose
fate
she
was
still
ignorant
lightened
the
darkness
of
her
night
and
she
was
able
to
murmur
resignedly
afterwards
afterwards
go
and
live
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
drying
her
eyes
and
trying
to
look
calm
she
turned
to
her
guards
and
said
in
a
low
voice
with
an
indefinable
accent
that
was
a
complaint
and
a
lament
a
prayer
and
a
reproach
sorrow
condensed
into
sound
now
we
in
the
town
even
the
soldiers
seemed
touched
as
they
answered
her
with
a
gesture
she
struggled
to
affect
a
calm
bearing
while
she
went
forward
quickly
at
that
moment
the
church
bells
began
to
peal
out
announcing
the
end
of
the
high
mass
sisa
hurried
her
steps
so
as
to
avoid
if
possible
meeting
the
people
who
were
coming
out
but
in
vain
for
no
means
offered
to
escape
encountering
them
with
a
bitter
smile
she
saluted
two
of
her
acquaintances
who
merely
turned
inquiring
glances
upon
her
so
that
to
avoid
further
mortification
she
fixed
her
gaze
on
the
ground
and
yet
strange
to
say
she
stumbled
over
the
stones
in
the
road
upon
seeing
her
people
paused
for
a
moment
and
conversed
among
themselves
as
they
gazed
at
her
all
of
which
she
saw
and
felt
in
spite
of
her
downcast
eyes
she
heard
the
shameless
tones
of
a
woman
who
asked
from
behind
at
the
top
of
her
voice
where
did
you
catch
her
and
the
money
it
was
a
woman
without
a
tapis
or
tunic
dressed
in
a
green
and
yellow
skirt
and
a
camisa
of
blue
gauze
easily
recognizable
from
her
costume
as
a
of
the
soldiery
sisa
felt
as
if
she
had
received
a
slap
in
the
face
for
that
woman
had
exposed
her
before
the
crowd
she
raised
her
eyes
for
a
moment
to
get
her
fill
of
scorn
and
hate
but
saw
the
people
far
far
away
yet
she
felt
the
chill
of
their
stares
and
heard
their
whispers
as
she
moved
over
the
ground
almost
without
knowing
that
she
touched
it
eh
this
way
a
guard
called
to
her
like
an
automaton
whose
mechanism
is
breaking
she
whirled
about
rapidly
on
her
heels
then
without
seeing
or
thinking
of
anything
ran
to
hide
herself
she
made
out
a
door
where
a
sentinel
stood
and
tried
to
enter
it
but
a
still
more
imperious
voice
called
her
aside
with
wavering
steps
she
sought
the
direction
of
that
voice
then
felt
herself
pushed
along
by
the
shoulders
she
shut
her
eyes
took
a
couple
of
steps
and
lacking
further
strength
let
herself
fall
to
the
ground
first
on
her
knees
and
then
in
a
sitting
posture
dry
and
voiceless
sobs
shook
her
frame
convulsively
now
she
was
in
the
barracks
among
the
soldiers
women
hogs
and
chickens
some
of
the
men
were
sewing
at
their
clothes
while
their
thighs
furnished
pillows
for
their
who
were
reclining
on
benches
smoking
and
gazing
wearily
at
the
ceiling
other
women
were
helping
some
of
the
men
clean
their
ornaments
and
arms
humming
doubtful
songs
the
while
it
seems
that
the
chicks
have
escaped
for
you
brought
only
the
old
hen
commented
one
woman
to
the
new
arrivals
whether
alluding
to
sisa
or
the
still
clucking
hen
is
not
certain
yes
the
hen
is
always
worth
more
than
the
chicks
sisa
herself
answered
when
she
observed
that
the
soldiers
were
silent
where
the
sergeant
asked
one
of
the
guards
in
a
disgusted
tone
has
report
been
made
to
the
alferez
yet
a
general
shrugging
of
shoulders
was
his
answer
for
no
one
was
going
to
trouble
himself
inquiring
about
the
fate
of
a
poor
woman
there
sisa
spent
two
hours
in
a
state
of
huddled
in
a
corner
with
her
head
hidden
in
her
arms
and
her
hair
falling
down
in
disorder
at
noon
the
alferez
was
informed
and
the
first
thing
that
he
did
was
to
discredit
the
curate
accusation
bah
tricks
of
that
rascally
friar
he
commented
as
he
ordered
that
the
woman
be
released
and
that
no
one
should
pay
any
attention
to
the
matter
if
he
wants
to
get
back
what
he
lost
let
him
ask
anthony
or
complain
to
the
nuncio
out
with
her
consequently
sisa
was
ejected
from
the
barracks
almost
violently
as
she
did
not
try
to
move
herself
finding
herself
in
the
street
she
instinctively
started
to
hurry
toward
her
house
with
her
head
bared
her
hair
disheveled
and
her
gaze
fixed
on
the
distant
horizon
the
sun
burned
in
its
zenith
with
never
a
cloud
to
shade
its
flashing
disk
the
wind
shook
the
leaves
of
the
trees
lightly
along
the
dry
road
while
no
bird
dared
stir
from
the
shade
of
their
branches
at
last
sisa
reached
her
hut
and
entered
it
in
silence
she
walked
all
about
it
and
ran
in
and
out
for
a
time
then
she
hurried
to
old
house
and
knocked
at
the
door
but
he
was
not
at
home
the
unhappy
woman
then
returned
to
her
hut
and
began
to
call
loudly
for
basilio
and
crispin
stopping
every
few
minutes
to
listen
attentively
her
voice
came
back
in
an
echo
for
the
soft
murmur
of
the
water
in
the
neighboring
river
and
the
rustling
of
the
bamboo
leaves
were
the
only
sounds
that
broke
the
stillness
she
called
again
and
again
as
she
climbed
the
low
cliffs
or
went
down
into
a
gully
or
descended
to
the
river
her
eyes
rolled
about
with
a
sinister
expression
now
flashing
up
with
brilliant
gleams
now
becoming
obscured
like
the
sky
on
a
stormy
night
it
might
be
said
that
the
light
of
reason
was
flickering
and
about
to
be
extinguished
again
returning
to
her
hut
she
sat
down
on
the
mat
where
she
had
lain
the
night
before
raising
her
eyes
she
saw
a
twisted
remnant
from
basilio
camisa
at
the
end
of
the
bamboo
post
in
the
or
wall
that
overlooked
the
precipice
she
seized
and
examined
it
in
the
sunlight
there
were
blood
stains
on
it
but
sisa
hardly
saw
them
for
she
went
outside
and
continued
to
raise
and
lower
it
before
her
eyes
to
examine
it
in
the
burning
sunlight
the
light
was
failing
and
everything
beginning
to
grow
dark
around
her
she
gazed
and
unblinkingly
straight
at
the
sun
still
wandering
about
here
and
there
crying
and
wailing
she
would
have
frightened
any
listener
for
her
voice
now
uttered
rare
notes
such
as
are
not
often
produced
in
the
human
throat
in
a
night
of
roaring
tempest
when
the
whirling
winds
beat
with
invisible
wings
against
the
crowding
shadows
that
ride
upon
it
if
you
should
find
yourself
in
a
solitary
and
ruined
building
you
would
hear
moans
and
sighs
which
you
might
suppose
to
be
the
soughing
of
the
wind
as
it
beats
on
the
high
towers
and
moldering
walls
to
fill
you
with
terror
and
make
you
shudder
in
spite
of
yourself
as
mournful
as
those
unknown
sounds
of
the
dark
night
when
the
tempest
roars
were
the
accents
of
that
mother
in
this
condition
night
came
upon
her
perhaps
heaven
had
granted
some
hours
of
sleep
while
the
invisible
wing
of
an
angel
brushing
over
her
pallid
countenance
might
wipe
out
the
sorrows
from
her
memory
perhaps
such
suffering
was
too
great
for
weak
human
endurance
and
providence
had
intervened
with
its
sweet
remedy
forgetfulness
however
that
may
be
the
next
day
sisa
wandered
about
smiling
singing
and
talking
with
all
the
creatures

and

chapter

lights
and
shadows
three
days
have
passed
since
the
events
narrated
three
days
which
the
town
of
san
diego
has
devoted
to
making
preparations
for
the
fiesta
commenting
and
murmuring
at
the
same
time
while
all
were
enjoying
the
prospect
of
the
pleasures
to
come
some
spoke
ill
of
the
gobernadorcillo
others
of
the
others
of
the
young
men
and
there
were
not
lacking
those
who
blamed
everybody
for
everything
there
was
a
great
deal
of
comment
on
the
arrival
of
maria
clara
accompanied
by
her
aunt
isabel
all
rejoiced
over
it
because
they
loved
her
and
admired
her
beauty
while
at
the
same
time
they
wondered
at
the
change
that
had
come
over
padre
salvi
he
often
becomes
inattentive
during
the
holy
services
nor
does
he
talk
much
with
us
and
he
is
thinner
and
more
taciturn
than
usual
commented
his
penitents
the
cook
noticed
him
getting
thinner
and
thinner
by
minutes
and
complained
of
the
little
honor
that
was
done
to
his
dishes
but
that
which
caused
the
most
comment
among
the
people
was
the
fact
that
in
the
convento
were
to
be
seen
more
than
two
lights
burning
during
the
evening
while
padre
salvi
was
on
a
visit
to
a
private
dwelling
the
home
of
maria
clara
the
pious
women
crossed
themselves
but
continued
their
comments
ibarra
had
telegraphed
from
the
capital
of
the
province
welcoming
aunt
isabel
and
her
niece
but
had
failed
to
explain
the
reason
for
his
absence
many
thought
him
a
prisoner
on
account
of
his
treatment
of
padre
salvi
on
the
afternoon
of
all
saints
but
the
comments
reached
a
climax
when
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
they
saw
him
alight
before
the
home
of
his
fiancée
and
extend
a
polite
greeting
to
the
priest
who
was
just
entering
the
same
house
sisa
and
her
sons
were
forgotten
by
all
if
we
should
now
go
into
the
home
of
maria
clara
a
beautiful
nest
set
among
trees
of
orange
and
we
should
surprise
the
two
young
people
at
a
window
overlooking
the
lake
shadowed
by
flowers
and
climbing
vines
which
exhaled
a
delicate
perfume
their
lips
murmured
words
softer
than
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
and
sweeter
than
the
aromatic
odors
that
floated
through
the
garden
it
was
the
hour
when
the
sirens
of
the
lake
take
advantage
of
the
fast
falling
twilight
to
show
their
merry
heads
above
the
waves
to
gaze
upon
the
setting
sun
and
sing
it
to
rest
it
is
said
that
their
eyes
and
hair
are
blue
and
that
they
are
crowned
with
white
and
red
water
plants
that
at
times
the
foam
reveals
their
shapely
forms
whiter
than
the
foam
itself
and
that
when
night
descends
completely
they
begin
their
divine
sports
playing
mysterious
airs
like
those
of
æolian
harps
but
let
us
turn
to
our
young
people
and
listen
to
the
end
of
their
conversation
ibarra
was
speaking
to
maria
clara
tomorrow
before
daybreak
your
wish
shall
be
fulfilled
i
arrange
everything
tonight
so
that
nothing
will
be
lacking
then
i
write
to
my
girl
friends
to
come
but
arrange
it
so
that
the
curate
wo
be
there
why
because
he
seems
to
be
watching
me
his
deep
gloomy
eyes
trouble
me
and
when
he
fixes
them
on
me
i
afraid
when
he
talks
to
me
his
voice
oh
he
speaks
of
such
odd
such
strange
such
incomprehensible
things
he
asked
me
once
if
i
have
ever
dreamed
of
letters
from
my
mother
i
really
believe
that
he
is
my
friend
sinang
and
my
andeng
say
that
he
is
somewhat
touched
because
he
neither
eats
nor
bathes
and
lives
in
darkness
see
to
it
that
he
does
not
come
we
ca
do
otherwise
than
invite
him
answered
ibarra
thoughtfully
the
customs
of
the
country
require
it
he
is
in
your
house
and
besides
he
has
conducted
himself
nobly
toward
me
when
the
alcalde
consulted
him
about
the
business
of
which
i
told
you
he
had
only
praises
for
me
and
did
try
to
put
the
least
obstacle
in
the
way
but
i
see
that
you
serious
about
it
so
cease
worrying
for
he
wo
go
in
the
same
boat
with
us
light
footsteps
were
heard
it
was
the
curate
who
approached
with
a
forced
smile
on
his
lips
the
wind
is
chilly
he
said
and
when
one
catches
cold
one
generally
does
get
rid
of
it
until
the
hot
weather
are
you
afraid
of
catching
cold
his
voice
trembled
and
his
eyes
were
turned
toward
the
distant
horizon
away
from
the
young
people
no
we
rather
find
the
night
pleasant
and
the
breeze
delicious
answered
ibarra
during
these
months
we
have
our
autumn
and
our
spring
some
leaves
fall
but
the
flowers
are
always
in
bloom
fray
salvi
sighed
i
think
the
union
of
these
two
seasons
beautiful
with
no
cold
winter
intervening
continued
ibarra
in
february
the
buds
on
the
trees
will
burst
open
and
in
march
we
have
the
ripe
fruit
when
the
hot
month
come
we
shall
go
elsewhere
fray
salvi
smiled
and
began
to
talk
of
commonplace
things
of
the
weather
of
the
town
and
of
the
fiesta
maria
clara
slipped
away
on
some
pretext
since
we
are
talking
of
fiestas
allow
me
to
invite
you
to
the
one
that
we
are
going
to
celebrate
tomorrow
it
is
to
be
a
picnic
in
the
woods
which
we
and
our
friends
are
going
to
hold
together
where
will
it
be
held
the
young
women
wish
to
hold
it
by
the
brook
in
the
neighboring
wood
near
to
the
old
balete
so
we
shall
rise
early
to
avoid
the
sun
the
priest
thought
a
moment
and
then
answered
the
invitation
is
very
tempting
and
i
accept
it
to
prove
to
you
that
i
hold
no
rancor
against
you
but
i
shall
have
to
go
late
after
i
attended
to
my
duties
happy
are
you
who
are
free
entirely
free
a
few
moments
later
ibarra
left
in
order
to
look
after
the
arrangements
for
the
picnic
on
the
next
day
the
night
was
dark
and
in
the
street
some
one
approached
and
saluted
him
respectfully
who
are
you
asked
ibarra
sir
you
do
know
my
name
answered
the
unknown
but
i
been
waiting
for
you
two
days
for
what
purpose
because
nowhere
has
any
pity
been
shown
me
and
they
say
that
i
an
outlaw
sir
but
i
lost
my
two
sons
my
wife
is
insane
and
every
one
says
that
i
deserve
what
has
happened
to
me
ibarra
looked
at
the
man
critically
as
he
asked
what
do
you
want
now
to
beg
for
your
pity
upon
my
wife
and
sons
i
ca
stop
now
replied
ibarra
if
you
wish
to
come
you
can
tell
me
as
we
go
along
what
has
happened
to
you
the
man
thanked
him
and
the
two
quickly
disappeared
in
the
shadows
along
the
dimly
lighted
street
chapter
xxiii
fishing
the
stars
still
glittered
in
the
sapphire
arch
of
heaven
and
the
birds
were
still
sleeping
among
the
branches
when
a
merry
party
lighted
by
torches
of
resin
commonly
called
made
its
way
through
the
streets
toward
the
lake
there
were
five
girls
who
walked
along
rapidly
with
hands
clasped
or
arms
encircling
one
another
waists
followed
by
some
old
women
and
by
servants
who
were
carrying
gracefully
on
their
heads
baskets
of
food
and
dishes
looking
upon
the
laughing
and
hopeful
countenances
of
the
young
women
and
watching
the
wind
blow
about
their
abundant
black
hair
and
the
wide
folds
of
their
garments
we
might
have
taken
them
for
goddesses
of
the
night
fleeing
from
the
day
did
we
not
know
that
they
were
maria
clara
and
her
four
friends
the
merry
sinang
the
grave
victoria
the
beautiful
iday
and
the
thoughtful
neneng
of
modest
and
timid
beauty
they
were
conversing
in
a
lively
manner
laughing
and
pinching
one
another
whispering
in
one
another
ears
and
then
breaking
out
into
loud
laughter
you
wake
up
the
people
who
are
still
asleep
aunt
isabel
scolded
when
we
were
young
we
did
make
so
much
disturbance
neither
would
you
get
up
so
early
nor
would
the
old
folks
have
been
such
retorted
little
sinang
they
were
silent
for
a
short
time
then
tried
to
talk
in
low
tones
but
soon
forgot
themselves
and
again
filled
the
street
with
their
fresh
young
voices
behave
as
if
you
were
displeased
and
do
talk
to
him
sinang
was
advising
maria
clara
scold
him
so
he
wo
get
into
bad
habits
do
be
so
exacting
objected
iday
be
exacting
do
be
foolish
he
must
be
made
to
obey
while
only
engaged
for
after
he
your
husband
he
do
as
he
pleases
counseled
little
sinang
what
do
you
know
about
that
child
her
cousin
victoria
corrected
her
sst
keep
quiet
for
here
they
come
a
group
of
young
men
lighting
their
way
with
large
bamboo
torches
now
came
up
marching
gravely
along
to
the
sound
of
a
guitar
it
sounds
like
a
beggar
guitar
laughed
sinang
when
the
two
parties
met
it
was
the
women
who
maintained
a
serious
and
formal
attitude
just
as
if
they
had
never
known
how
to
laugh
while
on
the
other
hand
the
men
talked
and
laughed
asking
six
questions
to
get
half
an
answer
is
the
lake
calm
do
you
think
we
have
good
weather
asked
the
mothers
do
be
alarmed
ladies
i
know
how
to
swim
well
answered
a
tall
thin
emaciated
youth
we
ought
to
have
heard
mass
first
sighed
aunt
isabel
clasping
her
hands
there
yet
time
albino
has
been
a
theological
student
in
his
day
and
can
say
it
in
the
boat
remarked
another
youth
pointing
to
the
tall
thin
one
who
had
first
spoken
the
latter
who
had
a
clownish
countenance
threw
himself
into
an
attitude
of
contrition
caricaturing
padre
salvi
ibarra
though
he
maintained
his
serious
demeanor
also
joined
in
the
merriment
when
they
arrived
at
the
beach
there
involuntarily
escaped
from
the
women
exclamations
of
surprise
and
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
two
large
bankas
fastened
together
and
picturesquely
adorned
with
garlands
of
flowers
leaves
and
ruined
cotton
of
many
colors
little
paper
lanterns
hung
from
an
improvised
canopy
amid
flowers
and
fruits
comfortable
seats
with
rugs
and
cushions
for
the
women
had
been
provided
by
ibarra
even
the
paddles
and
oars
were
decorated
while
in
the
more
profusely
decorated
banka
were
a
harp
guitars
accordions
and
a
trumpet
made
from
a
carabao
horn
in
the
other
banka
fires
burned
on
the
clay
for
preparing
refreshments
of
tea
coffee
and
in
this
boat
here
the
women
and
in
the
other
there
the
men
ordered
the
mothers
upon
embarking
keep
quiet
do
move
about
so
or
be
upset
cross
yourself
first
advised
aunt
isabel
setting
the
example
are
we
to
be
here
all
alone
asked
sinang
with
a
grimace
ourselves
alone
this
question
was
opportunely
answered
by
a
pinch
from
her
mother
as
the
boats
moved
slowly
away
from
the
shore
the
light
of
the
lanterns
was
reflected
in
the
calm
waters
of
the
lake
while
in
the
eastern
sky
the
first
tints
of
dawn
were
just
beginning
to
appear
a
deep
silence
reigned
over
the
party
after
the
division
established
by
the
mothers
for
the
young
people
seemed
to
have
given
themselves
up
to
meditation
take
care
said
albino
the
student
in
a
loud
tone
to
another
youth
keep
your
foot
tight
on
the
plug
under
you
what
it
might
come
out
and
let
the
water
in
this
banka
has
a
lot
of
holes
in
it
oh
we
going
to
sink
cried
the
frightened
women
do
be
alarmed
ladies
the
student
reassured
them
to
calm
their
fears
the
banka
you
are
in
is
safe
it
has
only
five
holes
in
it
and
they
are
large
five
holes
do
you
want
to
drown
us
exclaimed
the
horrified
women
not
more
than
five
ladies
and
only
about
so
large
the
student
assured
them
indicating
the
circle
formed
with
his
index
finger
and
thumb
press
hard
on
the
plugs
so
that
they
wo
come
out
santísima
the
water
coming
in
cried
an
old
woman
who
felt
herself
already
getting
wet
there
now
arose
a
small
tumult
some
screamed
while
others
thought
of
jumping
into
the
water
press
hard
on
the
plugs
there
repeated
albino
pointing
toward
the
place
where
the
girls
were
where
where
we
do
know
how
for
pity
sake
come
here
for
we
do
know
how
begged
the
frightened
women
it
was
accordingly
necessary
for
five
of
the
young
men
to
get
over
into
the
other
banka
to
calm
the
terrified
mothers
but
by
some
strange
chance
it
seemed
that
there
w
as
danger
by
the
side
of
each
of
the
all
the
old
ladies
together
did
not
have
a
single
dangerous
hole
near
them
still
more
strange
it
was
that
ibarra
had
to
be
seated
by
the
side
of
maria
clara
albino
beside
victoria
and
so
on
quiet
was
restored
among
the
solicitous
mothers
but
not
in
the
circle
of
the
young
people
as
the
water
was
perfectly
still
the
not
far
away
and
the
hour
yet
early
it
was
decided
to
abandon
the
oars
so
that
all
might
partake
of
some
refreshment
dawn
had
now
come
so
the
lanterns
were
extinguished
there
nothing
to
compare
with
drunk
in
the
morning
before
going
to
mass
said
capitana
tika
mother
of
the
merry
sinang
drink
some
and
eat
a
albino
and
you
see
that
even
you
will
want
to
pray
that
what
i
doing
answered
the
youth
addressed
i
thinking
of
confessing
myself
no
said
sinang
drink
some
coffee
to
bring
merry
thoughts
i
will
at
once
because
i
feel
a
trifle
sad
do
do
that
advised
aunt
isabel
drink
some
tea
and
eat
a
few
crackers
they
say
that
tea
calms
one
thoughts
i
also
take
some
tea
and
crackers
answered
the
complaisant
youth
since
fortunately
none
of
these
drinks
is
catholicism
but
can
you
victoria
began
drink
some
chocolate
also
well
i
guess
so
since
breakfast
is
not
so
far
off
the
morning
was
beautiful
the
water
began
to
gleam
with
the
light
reflected
from
the
sky
with
such
clearness
that
every
object
stood
revealed
without
producing
a
shadow
a
bright
fresh
clearness
permeated
with
color
such
as
we
get
a
hint
of
in
some
marine
paintings
all
were
now
merry
as
they
breathed
in
the
light
breeze
that
began
to
arise
even
the
mothers
so
full
of
cautions
and
warnings
now
laughed
and
joked
among
themselves
do
you
remember
one
old
woman
was
saying
to
capitana
tika
do
you
remember
the
time
we
went
to
bathe
in
the
river
before
we
were
married
in
little
boats
made
from
there
drifted
down
with
the
current
fruits
of
many
kinds
and
fragrant
flowers
the
little
boats
had
banners
on
them
and
each
of
us
could
see
her
name
on
one
of
them
and
when
we
were
on
our
way
back
home
added
another
without
letting
her
go
on
we
found
the
bamboo
bridges
destroyed
and
so
we
had
to
wade
the
brooks
the
rascals
yes
i
know
that
i
chose
rather
to
let
the
borders
of
my
skirt
get
wet
than
to
uncover
my
feet
said
capitana
tika
for
i
knew
that
in
the
thickets
on
the
bank
there
were
eyes
watching
us
some
of
the
girls
who
heard
these
reminiscences
winked
and
smiled
while
the
others
were
so
occupied
with
their
own
conversations
that
they
took
no
notice
one
man
alone
he
who
performed
the
duty
of
pilot
remained
silent
and
removed
from
all
the
merriment
he
was
a
youth
of
athletic
build
and
striking
features
with
large
sad
eyes
and
compressed
lips
his
black
hair
long
and
unkempt
fell
over
a
stout
neck
a
dark
striped
shirt
afforded
a
suggestion
through
its
folds
of
the
powerful
muscles
that
enabled
the
vigorous
arms
to
handle
as
if
it
were
a
pen
the
wide
and
unwieldy
paddle
which
served
as
a
rudder
for
steering
the
two
bankas
maria
clara
had
more
than
once
caught
him
looking
at
her
but
on
such
occasions
he
had
quickly
turned
his
gaze
toward
the
distant
mountain
or
the
shore
the
young
woman
was
moved
with
pity
at
his
loneliness
and
offered
him
some
crackers
the
pilot
gave
her
a
surprised
stare
which
however
lasted
for
only
a
second
he
took
a
cracker
and
thanked
her
briefly
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
after
this
no
one
paid
any
more
attention
to
him
the
sallies
and
merry
laughter
of
the
young
folks
caused
not
the
slightest
movement
in
the
muscles
of
his
face
even
the
merry
sinang
did
not
make
him
smile
when
she
received
pinchings
that
caused
her
to
wrinkle
up
her
eyebrows
for
an
instant
only
to
return
to
her
former
merry
mood
the
lunch
over
they
proceeded
on
their
way
toward
the
of
which
there
were
two
situated
near
each
other
both
belonging
to
capitan
tiago
from
afar
were
to
be
seen
some
herons
perched
in
contemplative
attitude
on
the
tops
of
the
bamboo
posts
while
a
number
of
white
birds
which
the
tagalogs
call
flew
about
in
different
directions
skimming
the
water
with
their
wings
and
filling
the
air
with
shrill
cries
at
the
approach
of
the
bankas
the
herons
took
to
flight
and
maria
clara
followed
them
with
her
gaze
as
they
flew
in
the
direction
of
the
neighboring
mountain
do
those
birds
build
their
nests
on
the
mountain
she
asked
the
pilot
not
so
much
from
a
desire
to
know
as
for
the
purpose
of
making
him
talk
probably
they
do
señora
he
answered
but
no
one
up
to
this
time
has
ever
seen
their
nests
do
they
have
nests
i
suppose
they
must
have
them
otherwise
they
would
be
very
unfortunate
maria
clara
did
not
notice
the
tone
of
sadness
with
which
he
uttered
these
words
then
it
is
said
señora
answered
the
strange
youth
that
the
nests
of
those
birds
are
invisible
and
that
they
have
the
power
of
rendering
invisible
any
one
who
possesses
one
of
them
just
as
the
soul
can
only
be
seen
in
the
pure
mirror
of
the
eyes
so
also
in
the
mirror
of
the
water
alone
can
their
nests
be
looked
upon
maria
clara
became
sad
and
thoughtful
meanwhile
they
had
reached
the
first
and
an
aged
boatman
tied
the
craft
to
a
post
wait
called
aunt
isabel
to
the
son
of
the
fisherman
who
was
getting
ready
to
climb
upon
the
platform
of
the
corral
with
his
or
fastened
on
the
end
of
a
stout
bamboo
pole
we
must
get
the
ready
so
that
the
fish
may
pass
at
once
from
the
water
into
the
soup
kind
aunt
isabel
exclaimed
the
student
she
want
the
fish
to
miss
the
water
for
an
instant
andeng
maria
clara
in
spite
of
her
carefree
and
happy
face
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
being
an
excellent
cook
so
she
set
about
preparing
a
soup
of
rice
and
vegetables
helped
and
hindered
by
some
of
the
young
men
eager
perhaps
to
win
her
favor
the
other
young
women
all
busied
themselves
in
cutting
up
and
washing
the
vegetables
in
order
to
divert
the
impatience
of
those
who
were
waiting
to
see
the
fishes
taken
alive
and
wriggling
from
their
prison
the
beautiful
iday
got
out
the
harp
for
iday
not
only
played
well
on
that
instrument
but
besides
she
had
very
pretty
fingers
the
young
people
applauded
and
maria
clara
kissed
her
for
the
harp
is
the
most
popular
instrument
in
that
province
and
was
especially
suited
to
this
occasion
sing
the
hymn
about
marriage
begged
the
old
women
the
men
protested
and
victoria
who
had
a
fine
voice
complained
of
hoarseness
the
hymn
of
marriage
is
a
beautiful
tagalog
chant
in
which
are
set
forth
the
cares
and
sorrows
of
the
married
state
yet
not
passing
over
its
joys
they
then
asked
maria
clara
to
sing
but
she
protested
that
all
her
songs
were
sad
ones
this
protest
however
was
overruled
so
she
held
back
no
longer
taking
the
harp
she
played
a
short
prelude
and
then
sang
in
a
harmonious
and
vibrating
voice
full
of
feeling
sweet
are
the
hours
in
one
native
land
where
all
is
dear
the
sunbeams
bless
breezes
sweep
the
strand
and
death
is
soften
by
love
caress
warm
kisses
play
on
mother
lips
on
her
fond
tender
breast
awaking
when
round
her
neck
the
soft
arm
slips
and
bright
eyes
smile
all
love
partaking
sweet
is
death
for
one
native
land
where
all
is
dear
the
sunbeams
bless
dead
is
the
breeze
that
sweeps
the
strand
without
a
mother
home
or
love
caress
the
song
ceased
the
voice
died
away
the
harp
became
silent
and
they
still
listened
no
one
applauded
the
young
women
felt
their
eyes
fill
with
tears
and
ibarra
seemed
to
be
unpleasantly
affected
the
youthful
pilot
stared
motionless
into
the
distance
suddenly
a
thundering
roar
was
heard
such
that
the
women
screamed
and
covered
their
ears
it
was
the
student
blowing
with
all
the
strength
of
his
lungs
on
the
or
carabao
horn
laughter
and
cheerfulness
returned
while
eyes
brightened
are
you
trying
to
deafen
us
you
heretic
cried
aunt
isabel
madam
replied
the
offender
gravely
i
once
heard
of
a
poor
trumpeter
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
who
by
playing
on
his
trumpet
won
in
marriage
a
rich
and
noble
maiden
that
right
the
trumpeter
of
sackingen
exclaimed
ibarra
unable
to
resist
taking
part
in
the
renewed
merriment
do
you
hear
that
went
on
albino
now
i
want
to
see
if
i
have
the
same
luck
so
saying
he
began
to
blow
with
even
more
force
into
the
resounding
horn
holding
it
close
to
the
ears
of
the
girls
who
looked
saddest
as
might
be
expected
a
small
tumult
arose
and
the
mothers
finally
reduced
him
to
silence
by
beating
him
with
their
slippers
and
pinching
him
my
oh
my
he
complained
as
he
felt
of
his
smarting
arms
what
a
distance
there
is
between
the
philippines
and
the
banks
of
the
rhine
tempora
o
mores
some
are
given
honors
and
others
sanbenitos
all
laughed
at
this
even
the
grave
victoria
while
sinang
she
of
the
smiling
eyes
whispered
to
maria
clara
happy
girl
i
too
would
sing
if
i
could
andeng
at
length
announced
that
the
soup
was
ready
to
receive
its
guests
so
the
young
fisherman
climbed
up
into
the
pen
placed
at
the
narrower
end
of
the
corral
over
which
might
be
written
for
the
fishes
were
they
able
to
read
and
understand
italian
ogni
speranza
voi
ch
for
no
fish
that
gets
in
there
is
ever
released
except
by
death
this
division
of
the
corral
encloses
a
circular
space
so
arranged
that
a
man
can
stand
on
a
platform
in
the
upper
part
and
draw
the
fish
out
with
a
small
net
i
should
get
tired
fishing
there
with
a
pole
and
line
commented
sinang
trembling
with
pleasant
anticipation
all
were
now
watching
and
some
even
began
to
believe
that
they
saw
the
fishes
wriggling
about
in
the
net
and
showing
their
glittering
scales
but
when
the
youth
lowered
his
net
not
a
fish
leaped
up
it
must
be
full
whispered
albino
for
it
has
been
over
five
days
now
since
it
was
visited
the
fisherman
drew
in
his
net
but
not
even
a
single
little
fish
adorned
it
the
water
as
it
fell
back
in
glittering
drops
reflecting
the
sunlight
seemed
to
mock
his
efforts
with
a
silvery
smile
an
exclamation
of
surprise
displeasure
and
disappointment
escaped
from
the
lips
of
all
again
the
youth
repeated
the
operation
but
with
no
better
result
you
do
understand
your
business
said
albino
climbing
up
into
the
pen
of
the
corral
and
taking
the
net
from
the
youth
hands
now
you
see
andeng
get
the
pot
ready
but
apparently
albino
did
not
understand
the
business
either
for
the
net
again
came
up
empty
all
broke
out
into
laughter
at
him
do
make
so
much
noise
that
the
fish
can
hear
and
so
not
let
themselves
be
caught
this
net
must
be
torn
but
on
examination
all
the
meshes
of
the
net
appeared
to
be
intact
give
it
to
me
said
leon
iday
sweetheart
he
assured
himself
that
the
fence
was
in
good
condition
examined
the
net
and
being
satisfied
with
it
asked
are
you
sure
that
it
has
been
visited
for
five
days
very
sure
the
last
time
was
on
the
eve
of
all
saints
well
then
either
the
lake
is
enchanted
or
i
draw
up
something
leon
then
dropped
the
pole
into
the
water
and
instantly
astonishment
was
pictured
on
his
countenance
silently
he
looked
off
toward
the
mountain
and
moved
the
pole
about
in
the
water
then
without
raising
it
murmured
in
a
low
voice
a
cayman
a
cayman
repeated
everyone
as
the
word
ran
from
mouth
to
mouth
in
the
midst
of
fright
and
general
surprise
what
did
you
say
they
asked
him
i
say
that
we
caught
a
cayman
leon
assured
them
and
as
he
dropped
the
heavy
end
of
the
pole
into
the
water
he
continued
do
you
hear
that
sound
that
not
sand
but
a
tough
hide
the
back
of
a
cayman
do
you
see
how
the
posts
shake
he
pushing
against
them
even
though
he
is
all
rolled
up
wait
he
a
big
one
his
body
is
almost
a
foot
or
more
across
what
shall
we
do
was
the
question
catch
him
prompted
some
one
and
who
catch
him
no
one
offered
to
go
down
into
the
trap
for
the
water
was
deep
we
ought
to
tie
him
to
our
banka
and
drag
him
along
in
triumph
suggested
sinang
the
idea
of
his
eating
the
fish
that
we
were
going
to
eat
i
have
never
yet
seen
a
live
cayman
murmured
maria
clara
the
pilot
arose
picked
up
a
long
rope
and
climbed
nimbly
up
on
the
platform
where
leon
made
room
for
him
with
the
exception
of
maria
clara
no
one
had
taken
any
notice
of
him
but
now
all
admired
his
shapely
figure
to
the
great
surprise
of
all
and
in
spite
of
their
cries
he
leaped
down
into
the
enclosure
take
this
knife
called
crisostomo
to
him
holding
out
a
wide
toledo
blade
but
already
the
water
was
splashing
up
in
a
thousand
jets
and
the
depths
closed
mysteriously
maría
y
exclaimed
the
old
women
we
going
to
have
an
accident
do
be
uneasy
ladies
said
the
old
boatman
for
if
there
is
any
one
in
the
province
who
can
do
it
he
the
man
what
his
name
they
asked
we
call
him
pilot
and
he
the
best
i
ever
seen
only
he
does
like
the
business
the
water
became
disturbed
then
broke
into
ripples
the
fence
shook
a
struggle
seemed
to
be
going
on
in
the
depths
all
were
silent
and
hardly
breathed
ibarra
grasped
the
handle
of
the
sharp
knife
convulsively
now
the
struggle
seemed
to
be
at
an
end
and
the
head
of
the
youth
appeared
to
be
greeted
with
joyful
cries
the
eyes
of
the
old
women
filled
with
tears
the
pilot
climbed
up
with
one
end
of
the
rope
in
his
hand
and
once
on
the
platform
began
to
pull
on
it
the
monster
soon
appeared
above
the
water
with
the
rope
tied
in
a
double
band
around
its
neck
and
underneath
its
front
legs
it
was
a
large
one
as
leon
had
said
speckled
and
on
its
back
grew
the
green
moss
which
is
to
the
caymans
what
gray
hairs
are
to
men
roaring
like
a
bull
and
beating
its
tail
against
or
catching
hold
of
the
sides
of
the
corral
it
opened
its
huge
jaws
and
showed
its
long
sharp
teeth
the
pilot
was
hoisting
it
alone
for
no
one
had
thought
to
assist
him
once
out
of
the
water
and
resting
on
the
platform
he
placed
his
foot
upon
it
and
with
his
strong
hands
forced
its
huge
jaws
together
and
tried
to
tie
its
snout
with
stout
knots
with
a
last
effort
the
reptile
arched
its
body
struck
the
floor
with
its
powerful
tail
and
jerking
free
hurled
itself
with
one
leap
into
the
water
outside
the
corral
dragging
its
captor
along
with
it
a
cry
of
horror
broke
from
the
lips
of
all
but
like
a
flash
of
lightning
another
body
shot
into
the
water
so
quickly
that
there
was
hardly
time
to
realize
that
it
was
ibarra
maria
clara
did
not
swoon
only
for
the
reason
that
the
filipino
women
do
not
yet
know
how
to
do
so
the
anxious
watchers
saw
the
water
become
colored
and
dyed
with
blood
the
young
fisherman
jumped
down
with
his
bolo
in
his
hand
and
was
followed
by
his
father
but
they
had
scarcely
disappeared
when
crisostomo
and
the
pilot
reappeared
clinging
to
the
dead
body
of
the
reptile
which
had
the
whole
length
of
its
white
belly
slit
open
and
the
knife
still
sticking
in
its
throat
to
describe
the
joy
were
impossible
as
a
dozen
arms
reached
out
to
drag
the
young
men
from
the
water
the
old
women
were
beside
themselves
between
laughter
and
prayers
andeng
forgot
that
her
had
boiled
over
three
times
spilling
the
soup
and
putting
out
the
fire
the
only
one
who
could
say
nothing
was
maria
clara
ibarra
was
uninjured
while
the
pilot
had
only
a
slight
scratch
on
his
arm
i
owe
my
life
to
you
said
the
latter
to
ibarra
who
was
wrapping
himself
up
in
blankets
and
cloths
the
pilot
voice
seemed
to
have
a
note
of
sadness
in
it
you
are
too
daring
answered
ibarra
do
tempt
fate
again
if
you
had
not
come
up
again
murmured
the
still
pale
and
trembling
maria
clara
if
i
had
not
come
up
and
you
had
followed
me
replied
ibarra
completing
the
thought
in
his
own
way
in
the
bottom
of
the
lake
should
still
have
been
with
my
family
he
had
not
forgotten
that
there
lay
the
bones
of
his
father
the
old
women
did
not
want
to
visit
the
other
corral
but
wished
to
return
saying
that
the
day
had
begun
inauspiciously
and
that
many
more
accidents
might
occur
all
because
we
did
hear
mass
sighed
one
but
what
accident
has
befallen
us
ladies
asked
ibarra
the
cayman
seems
to
have
been
the
only
unlucky
one
all
of
which
proves
concluded
the
of
theology
that
in
all
its
sinful
life
this
unfortunate
reptile
has
never
attended
mass
at
least
i
never
seen
him
among
the
many
other
caymans
that
frequent
the
church
so
the
boats
were
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
other
corral
and
andeng
had
to
get
her
ready
again
the
day
was
now
well
advanced
with
a
fresh
breeze
blowing
the
waves
curled
up
behind
the
body
of
the
cayman
raising
mountains
of
foam
whereon
the
smooth
rich
sunlight
glitters
as
the
poet
says
the
music
again
resounded
iday
played
on
the
harp
while
the
men
handled
the
accordions
and
guitars
with
greater
or
less
skill
the
was
albino
who
actually
scratched
the
instruments
getting
out
of
tune
and
losing
the
time
every
moment
or
else
forgetting
it
and
changing
to
another
tune
entirely
different
the
second
corral
was
visited
with
some
misgivings
as
many
expected
to
find
there
the
mate
of
the
dead
cayman
but
nature
is
ever
a
jester
and
the
nets
came
up
full
at
each
haul
aunt
isabel
superintended
the
sorting
of
the
fish
and
ordered
that
some
be
left
in
the
trap
for
decoys
it
not
lucky
to
empty
the
corral
completely
she
concluded
then
they
made
their
way
toward
the
shore
near
the
forest
of
old
trees
that
belonged
to
ibarra
there
in
the
shade
by
the
clear
waters
of
the
brook
among
the
flowers
they
ate
their
breakfast
under
improvised
canopies
the
space
was
filled
with
music
while
the
smoke
from
the
fires
curled
up
in
slender
wreaths
the
water
bubbled
cheerfully
in
the
hot
dishes
as
though
uttering
sounds
of
consolation
or
perchance
of
sarcasm
and
irony
to
the
dead
fishes
the
body
of
the
cayman
writhed
about
sometimes
showing
its
torn
white
belly
and
again
its
speckled
greenish
back
while
man
nature
favorite
went
on
his
way
undisturbed
by
what
the
brahmins
and
vegetarians
would
call
so
many
cases
of
fratricide
chapter
xxiv
in
the
wood
early
very
early
indeed
somewhat
differently
from
his
usual
custom
padre
salvi
had
celebrated
mass
and
cleansed
a
dozen
sinful
souls
in
a
few
moments
then
it
seemed
that
the
reading
of
some
letters
which
he
had
received
firmly
sealed
and
waxed
caused
the
worthy
curate
to
lose
his
appetite
since
he
allowed
his
chocolate
to
become
completely
cold
the
padre
is
getting
sick
commented
the
cook
while
preparing
another
cup
for
days
he
has
eaten
of
the
six
dishes
that
i
set
before
him
on
the
table
he
does
touch
even
two
it
because
he
sleeps
badly
replied
the
other
servant
he
has
nightmares
since
he
changed
his
bedroom
his
eyes
are
becoming
more
sunken
all
the
time
and
he
getting
thinner
and
yellower
day
by
day
truly
padre
salvi
was
a
pitiable
sight
he
did
not
care
to
touch
the
second
cup
of
chocolate
nor
to
taste
the
sweet
cakes
of
cebu
instead
he
paced
thoughtfully
about
the
spacious
sala
crumpling
in
his
bony
hands
the
letters
which
he
read
from
time
to
time
finally
he
called
for
his
carriage
got
ready
and
directed
that
he
be
taken
to
the
wood
where
stood
the
fateful
tree
near
which
the
picnic
was
being
held
arriving
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
the
padre
dismissed
his
carriage
and
made
his
way
alone
into
its
depths
a
gloomy
pathway
opened
a
difficult
passage
through
the
thickets
and
led
to
the
brook
formed
by
certain
warm
springs
like
many
that
flow
from
the
slopes
of
makiling
adorning
its
banks
grow
wild
flowers
many
of
which
have
as
yet
no
latin
names
but
which
are
doubtless
to
the
gilded
insects
and
butterflies
of
all
shapes
and
colors
blue
and
gold
white
and
black
glittering
with
iridescent
spots
with
rubies
and
emeralds
on
their
wings
and
to
the
countless
beetles
with
their
metallic
lusters
of
powdered
gold
the
hum
of
the
insects
the
cries
of
the
cicada
which
cease
not
night
or
day
the
songs
of
the
birds
and
the
dry
crashing
of
the
rotten
branch
that
falls
and
strikes
all
around
against
the
trees
are
the
only
sounds
to
break
the
stillness
of
that
mysterious
place
for
some
time
the
padre
wandered
aimlessly
among
the
thick
underbrush
avoiding
the
thorns
that
caught
at
his
habit
as
though
to
detain
him
and
the
roots
of
the
trees
that
protruded
from
the
soil
to
form
at
every
step
for
this
wanderer
unaccustomed
to
such
places
but
suddenly
his
feet
were
arrested
by
the
sound
of
clear
voices
raised
in
merry
laughter
seeming
to
come
from
the
brook
and
apparently
drawing
nearer
i
going
to
see
if
i
can
find
one
of
those
nests
said
a
beautiful
sweet
voice
which
the
curate
recognized
i
like
to
see
without
having
him
see
me
so
i
could
follow
him
everywhere
padre
salvi
hid
behind
the
trunk
of
a
large
tree
and
set
himself
to
eavesdrop
does
that
mean
that
you
want
to
do
with
him
what
the
curate
does
with
you
asked
a
laughing
voice
he
watches
you
everywhere
be
careful
for
jealousy
makes
people
thin
and
puts
rings
around
their
eyes
no
no
not
jealousy
it
pure
curiosity
replied
the
silvery
voice
while
the
laughing
one
repeated
yes
jealousy
jealousy
and
she
burst
out
into
merry
laughter
if
i
were
jealous
instead
of
making
myself
invisible
i
make
him
so
in
order
that
no
one
might
see
him
but
neither
would
you
see
and
that
would
be
nice
the
best
thing
for
us
to
do
if
we
find
the
nest
would
be
to
present
it
to
the
curate
so
that
he
could
watch
over
us
without
the
necessity
of
our
seeing
him
do
you
think
so
i
do
believe
in
those
herons
nests
interrupted
another
voice
but
if
at
any
time
i
should
be
jealous
i
know
how
to
watch
and
still
keep
myself
hidden
how
how
perhaps
like
a
escucha
this
reminiscence
of
provoked
another
merry
burst
of
laughter
and
you
know
how
she
fooled
the
escucha
from
his
padre
salvi
saw
maria
clara
victoria
and
sinang
wading
along
the
border
of
the
brook
they
were
moving
forward
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
crystal
waters
seeking
the
enchanted
nest
of
the
heron
wet
to
their
knees
so
that
the
wide
folds
of
their
bathing
skirts
revealed
the
graceful
curves
of
their
bodies
their
hair
was
flung
loose
their
arms
bare
and
they
wore
camisas
with
wide
stripes
of
bright
hues
while
looking
for
something
that
they
could
not
find
they
were
picking
flowers
and
plants
which
grew
along
the
bank
the
religious
acteon
stood
pale
and
motionless
gazing
at
that
chaste
diana
but
his
eyes
glittered
in
their
dark
circles
untired
of
staring
at
those
white
and
shapely
arms
and
at
that
elegant
neck
and
bust
while
the
small
rosy
feet
that
played
in
the
water
awoke
in
his
starved
being
strange
sensations
and
in
his
burning
brain
dreams
of
new
ideas
the
three
charming
figures
disappeared
behind
a
bamboo
thicket
around
a
bend
in
the
brook
and
their
cruel
allusions
ceased
to
be
heard
intoxicated
staggering
covered
with
perspiration
padre
salvi
left
his
and
looked
all
about
him
with
rolling
eyes
he
stood
still
as
if
in
doubt
then
took
a
few
steps
as
though
he
would
try
to
follow
the
girls
but
turned
again
and
made
his
way
along
the
banks
of
the
stream
to
seek
the
rest
of
the
party
at
a
little
distance
he
saw
in
the
middle
of
the
brook
a
kind
of
well
enclosed
decorated
with
palm
leaves
flowers
and
streamers
with
a
leafy
clump
of
bamboo
for
a
covering
from
within
which
came
the
sound
of
happy
feminine
voices
farther
on
he
saw
a
bamboo
bridge
and
beyond
it
the
men
bathing
near
these
a
crowd
of
servants
was
busily
engaged
around
improvised
in
plucking
chickens
washing
rice
and
roasting
a
pig
on
the
opposite
bank
in
a
cleared
space
were
gathered
men
and
women
under
a
canvas
covering
which
was
fastened
partly
to
the
hoary
trees
and
partly
to
stakes
there
were
gathered
the
alferez
the
coadjutor
the
gobernadorcillo
the
the
schoolmaster
and
many
other
personages
of
the
town
even
including
sinang
father
capitan
basilio
who
had
been
the
adversary
of
the
deceased
don
rafael
in
an
old
lawsuit
ibarra
had
said
to
him
we
are
disputing
over
a
point
of
law
but
that
does
not
mean
that
we
are
enemies
so
the
celebrated
orator
of
the
conservatives
had
enthusiastically
accepted
the
invitation
sending
along
three
turkeys
and
putting
his
servants
at
the
young
man
disposal
the
curate
was
received
with
respect
and
deference
by
all
even
the
alferez
why
where
has
your
reverence
been
asked
the
latter
as
he
noticed
the
curate
scratched
face
and
his
habit
covered
with
leaves
and
dry
twigs
has
your
reverence
had
a
fall
no
i
lost
my
way
replied
padre
salvi
lowering
his
gaze
to
examine
his
gown
bottles
of
lemonade
were
brought
out
and
green
coconuts
were
split
open
so
that
the
bathers
as
they
came
from
the
water
might
refresh
themselves
with
the
milk
and
the
soft
meat
whiter
than
the
milk
itself
the
girls
all
received
in
addition
rosaries
of
sampaguitas
intertwined
with
roses
and
blossoms
to
perfume
their
flowing
tresses
some
of
the
company
sat
on
the
ground
or
reclined
in
hammocks
swung
from
the
branches
of
the
trees
while
others
amused
themselves
around
a
wide
flat
rock
on
which
were
to
be
seen
a
booklets
cowry
shells
and
pebbles
they
showed
the
cayman
to
the
curate
but
he
seemed
inattentive
until
they
told
him
that
the
gaping
wound
had
been
inflicted
by
ibarra
the
celebrated
and
unknown
pilot
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
as
he
had
disappeared
before
the
arrival
of
the
alferez
at
length
maria
clara
came
from
the
bath
with
her
companions
looking
fresh
as
a
rose
on
its
first
morning
when
the
dew
sparkling
on
its
fair
petals
glistens
like
diamonds
her
first
smile
was
for
crisostomo
and
the
first
cloud
on
her
brow
for
padre
salvi
who
noted
it
and
sighed
the
lunch
hour
was
now
come
and
the
curate
the
coadjutor
the
gobernadorcillo
the
and
the
other
dignitaries
took
their
seats
at
the
table
over
which
ibarra
presided
the
mothers
would
not
permit
any
of
the
men
to
eat
at
the
table
where
the
young
women
sat
this
time
albino
you
ca
invent
holes
as
in
the
bankas
said
leon
to
the
quondam
student
of
theology
what
that
asked
the
old
women
the
bankas
ladies
were
as
whole
as
this
plate
is
explained
leon
the
rascal
exclaimed
the
smiling
aunt
isabel
have
you
yet
learned
anything
of
the
criminal
who
assaulted
padre
damaso
inquired
fray
salvi
of
the
alferez
of
what
criminal
padre
asked
the
military
man
staring
at
the
friar
over
the
glass
of
wine
that
he
was
emptying
what
criminal
why
the
one
who
struck
padre
damaso
in
the
road
yesterday
afternoon
struck
padre
damaso
asked
several
voices
the
coadjutor
seemed
to
smile
while
padre
salvi
went
on
yes
and
padre
damaso
is
now
confined
to
his
bed
it
thought
that
he
may
be
the
very
same
elias
who
threw
you
into
the
mudhole
señor
alferez
either
from
shame
or
wine
the
alferez
face
became
very
red
of
course
i
thought
continued
padre
salvi
in
a
joking
manner
that
you
the
alferez
of
the
civil
guard
would
be
informed
about
the
affair
the
soldier
bit
his
lip
and
was
murmuring
some
foolish
excuse
when
the
meal
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
a
pale
thin
woman
no
one
had
noticed
her
approach
for
she
had
come
so
noiselessly
that
at
night
she
might
have
been
taken
for
a
ghost
give
this
poor
woman
something
to
eat
cried
the
old
women
come
here
still
the
strange
woman
kept
on
her
way
to
the
table
where
the
curate
was
seated
as
he
turned
his
face
and
recognized
her
his
knife
dropped
from
his
hand
give
this
woman
something
to
eat
ordered
ibarra
the
night
is
dark
and
the
boys
disappear
murmured
the
wandering
woman
but
at
sight
of
the
alferez
who
spoke
to
her
she
became
frightened
and
ran
away
among
the
trees
who
is
she
he
asked
an
unfortunate
woman
who
has
become
insane
from
fear
and
sorrow
answered
don
filipo
for
four
days
now
she
has
been
so
is
her
name
sisa
asked
ibarra
with
interest
your
soldiers
arrested
her
continued
the
rather
bitterly
to
the
alferez
they
marched
her
through
the
town
on
account
of
something
about
her
sons
which
is
very
clearly
known
what
exclaimed
the
alferez
turning
to
the
curate
she
is
the
mother
of
your
two
sacristans
the
curate
nodded
in
affirmation
they
disappeared
and
nobody
made
any
inquiries
about
them
added
don
filipo
with
a
severe
look
at
the
gobernadorcillo
who
dropped
his
eyes
look
for
that
woman
crisostomo
ordered
the
servants
i
promised
to
try
to
learn
where
her
sons
are
they
disappeared
did
you
say
asked
the
alferez
your
sacristans
disappeared
padre
the
friar
emptied
the
glass
of
wine
before
him
and
again
nodded
padre
exclaimed
the
alferez
with
a
sarcastic
laugh
pleased
at
the
thought
of
a
little
revenge
a
few
pesos
of
your
reverence
disappear
and
my
sergeant
is
routed
out
early
to
hunt
for
them
two
sacristans
disappear
and
your
reverence
says
nothing
and
you
señor
capitan
it
also
true
that
you
here
he
broke
off
with
another
laugh
as
he
buried
his
spoon
in
the
red
meat
of
a
wild
papaya
the
curate
confused
and
not
upon
what
he
was
saying
replied
that
because
i
have
to
answer
for
the
money
a
good
answer
reverend
shepherd
of
souls
interrupted
the
alferez
with
his
mouth
full
of
food
a
splendid
answer
holy
man
ibarra
wished
to
intervene
but
padre
salvi
controlled
himself
by
an
effort
and
said
with
a
forced
smile
then
you
do
know
sir
what
is
said
about
the
disappearance
of
those
boys
no
then
ask
your
soldiers
what
exclaimed
the
alferez
all
his
mirth
gone
it
said
that
on
the
night
they
disappeared
several
shots
were
heard
several
shots
echoed
the
alferez
looking
around
at
the
other
guests
who
nodded
their
heads
in
corroboration
of
the
statement
padre
salvi
then
replied
slowly
and
with
cutting
sarcasm
come
now
i
see
that
you
do
catch
the
criminals
nor
do
you
know
what
is
going
on
in
your
own
house
yet
you
try
to
set
yourself
up
as
a
preacher
to
point
out
their
duties
to
others
you
ought
to
keep
in
mind
that
proverb
about
the
fool
in
his
own
house
gentlemen
interrupted
ibarra
seeing
that
the
alferez
had
grown
pale
in
this
connection
i
should
like
to
have
your
opinion
about
a
project
of
mine
i
thinking
of
putting
this
crazy
woman
under
the
care
of
a
skilful
physician
and
in
the
meantime
with
your
aid
and
advice
i
search
for
her
sons
the
return
of
the
servants
without
the
madwoman
whom
they
had
been
unable
to
find
brought
peace
by
turning
the
conversation
to
other
matters
the
meal
ended
and
while
the
tea
and
coffee
were
being
served
both
old
and
young
scattered
about
in
different
groups
some
took
the
chessmen
others
the
cards
while
the
girls
curious
about
the
future
chose
to
put
questions
to
a
of
come
señor
ibarra
called
capitan
basilio
in
merry
mood
we
have
a
lawsuit
fifteen
years
old
and
there
is
a
judge
in
the
audiencia
who
can
settle
it
let
see
if
we
ca
end
it
on
the
with
the
greatest
pleasure
replied
the
youth
just
wait
a
moment
the
alferez
is
leaving
upon
hearing
about
this
match
all
the
old
men
who
understood
chess
gathered
around
the
board
for
it
promised
to
be
an
interesting
one
and
attracted
even
spectators
who
were
not
familiar
with
the
game
the
old
women
however
surrounded
the
curate
in
order
to
converse
with
him
about
spiritual
matters
but
fray
salvi
apparently
did
not
consider
the
place
and
time
appropriate
for
he
gave
vague
answers
and
his
sad
rather
bored
looks
wandered
in
all
directions
except
toward
his
questioners
the
began
with
great
solemnity
if
this
game
ends
in
a
draw
it
understood
that
the
lawsuit
is
to
be
dropped
said
ibarra
in
the
midst
of
the
game
ibarra
received
a
telegram
which
caused
his
eyes
to
shine
and
his
face
to
become
pale
he
put
it
into
his
pocketbook
at
the
same
time
glancing
toward
the
group
of
young
people
who
were
still
with
laughter
and
shouts
putting
questions
to
destiny
check
to
the
king
called
the
youth
capitan
basilio
had
no
other
recourse
than
to
hide
the
piece
behind
the
queen
check
to
the
queen
called
the
youth
as
he
threatened
that
piece
with
a
rook
which
was
defended
by
a
pawn
being
unable
to
protect
the
queen
or
to
withdraw
the
piece
on
account
of
the
king
behind
it
capitan
basilio
asked
for
time
to
reflect
willingly
agreed
ibarra
especially
as
i
have
something
to
say
this
very
minute
to
those
young
people
in
that
group
over
there
he
arose
with
the
agreement
that
his
opponent
should
have
a
quarter
of
an
hour
iday
had
the
round
card
on
which
were
written
the
questions
while
albino
held
the
book
of
answers
a
lie
it
not
so
cried
sinang
half
in
tears
what
the
matter
asked
maria
clara
just
imagine
i
asked
shall
i
have
some
sense
i
threw
the
dice
and
that
priest
read
from
the
book
the
frogs
raise
hair
what
do
you
think
of
that
as
she
said
this
sinang
made
a
grimace
at
the
laughing
student
who
told
you
to
ask
that
question
her
cousin
victoria
asked
her
to
ask
it
is
enough
to
deserve
such
an
answer
you
ask
a
question
they
said
to
ibarra
offering
him
the
wheel
we
decided
that
whoever
gets
the
best
answer
shall
receive
a
present
from
the
rest
each
of
us
has
already
had
a
question
who
got
the
best
answer
maria
clara
maria
clara
replied
sinang
we
made
her
ask
your
sweetheart
faithful
and
constant
and
the
book
answered
but
here
the
blushing
maria
clara
put
her
hands
over
sinang
mouth
so
that
she
could
not
finish
well
give
me
the
wheel
said
crisostomo
smiling
my
question
is
i
succeed
in
my
present
enterprise
what
an
ugly
question
exclaimed
sinang
ibarra
threw
the
dice
and
in
accordance
with
the
resulting
number
the
page
and
line
were
sought
dreams
are
dreams
read
albino
ibarra
drew
out
the
telegram
and
opened
it
with
trembling
hands
this
time
your
book
is
wrong
he
exclaimed
joyfully
read
this
project
approved
suit
decided
in
your
favor
what
does
it
mean
all
asked
did
you
say
that
a
present
is
to
be
given
to
the
one
receiving
the
best
answer
he
asked
in
a
voice
shaking
with
emotion
as
he
tore
the
telegram
carefully
into
two
pieces
yes
yes
well
then
this
is
my
present
he
said
as
he
gave
one
piece
to
maria
clara
a
school
for
boys
and
girls
is
to
be
built
in
the
town
and
this
school
is
my
present
and
the
other
part
what
does
it
mean
it
to
be
given
to
the
one
who
has
received
the
worst
answer
to
me
then
to
me
cried
sinang
ibarra
gave
her
the
other
piece
of
the
telegram
and
hastily
withdrew
what
does
it
mean
she
asked
but
the
happy
youth
was
already
at
a
distance
returning
to
the
game
of
chess
fray
salvi
in
abstracted
mood
approached
the
circle
of
young
people
maria
clara
wiped
away
her
tears
of
joy
the
laughter
ceased
and
the
talk
died
away
the
curate
stared
at
the
young
people
without
offering
to
say
anything
while
they
silently
waited
for
him
to
speak
what
this
he
at
length
asked
picking
up
the
book
and
turning
its
leaves
wheel
of
a
book
of
games
replied
leon
do
you
know
that
it
a
sin
to
believe
in
these
things
he
scolded
tearing
the
leaves
out
angrily
cries
of
surprise
and
anger
escaped
from
the
lips
of
all
it
a
greater
sin
to
dispose
of
what
is
yours
against
the
wish
of
the
owner
contradicted
albino
rising
padre
that
what
is
called
stealing
and
it
is
forbidden
by
god
and
men
maria
clara
clasped
her
hands
and
gazed
with
tearful
eyes
at
the
remnants
of
the
book
which
a
few
moments
before
had
been
the
source
of
so
much
happiness
for
her
contrary
to
the
general
expectation
fray
salvi
did
not
reply
to
albino
but
stood
staring
at
the
torn
leaves
as
they
were
whirled
about
some
falling
in
the
wood
some
in
the
water
then
he
staggered
away
with
his
hands
over
his
head
he
stopped
for
a
few
moments
to
speak
with
ibarra
who
accompanied
him
to
one
of
the
carriages
which
were
at
the
disposal
of
the
guests
he
doing
well
to
leave
that
murmured
sinang
he
has
a
face
that
seems
to
say
laugh
for
i
know
about
your
sins
after
making
the
present
to
his
fiancée
ibarra
was
so
happy
that
he
began
to
play
without
reflection
or
a
careful
examination
of
the
positions
of
the
pieces
the
result
was
that
although
capitan
basilio
was
hard
pressed
the
game
became
a
stalemate
owing
to
many
careless
moves
on
the
young
man
part
it
settled
we
at
peace
exclaimed
capitan
basilio
heartily
yes
we
at
peace
repeated
the
youth
whatever
the
decision
of
the
court
may
be
and
the
two
shook
hands
cordially
while
all
present
were
rejoicing
over
this
happy
termination
of
a
quarrel
of
which
both
parties
were
tired
the
sudden
arrival
of
a
sergeant
and
four
soldiers
of
the
civil
guard
all
armed
and
with
bayonets
fixed
disturbed
the
mirth
and
caused
fright
among
the
women
keep
still
everybody
shouted
the
sergeant
shoot
any
one
who
moves
in
spite
of
this
blustering
command
ibarra
arose
and
approached
the
sergeant
what
do
you
want
he
asked
that
you
deliver
to
us
at
once
a
criminal
named
elias
who
was
your
pilot
this
morning
was
the
threatening
reply
a
criminal
the
pilot
you
must
be
mistaken
answered
ibarra
no
sir
this
elias
has
just
been
accused
of
putting
his
hand
on
a
priest
oh
was
that
the
pilot
the
very
same
according
to
reports
you
admit
persons
of
bad
character
into
your
fiestas
señor
ibarra
ibarra
looked
him
over
from
head
to
foot
and
replied
with
great
disdain
i
do
have
to
give
you
an
account
of
my
actions
at
our
fiestas
all
are
welcome
had
you
yourself
come
you
would
have
found
a
place
at
our
table
just
as
did
your
alferez
who
was
with
us
a
couple
of
hours
ago
with
this
he
turned
his
back
the
sergeant
gnawed
at
the
ends
of
his
mustache
but
considering
himself
the
weaker
party
ordered
the
soldiers
to
institute
a
search
especially
among
the
trees
for
the
pilot
a
description
of
whom
he
carried
on
a
piece
of
paper
don
filipo
said
to
him
notice
that
this
description
fits
nine
tenths
of
the
natives
do
make
any
false
move
after
a
time
the
soldiers
returned
with
the
report
that
they
had
been
unable
to
see
either
banka
or
man
that
could
be
called
so
the
sergeant
muttered
a
few
words
and
went
away
as
he
had
come
in
the
manner
of
the
civil
guard
the
merriment
was
little
by
little
restored
amid
questions
and
comments
so
that
the
elias
who
threw
the
alferez
into
the
mudhole
said
leon
thoughtfully
how
did
that
happen
how
was
it
asked
some
of
the
more
curious
they
say
that
on
a
very
rainy
day
in
september
the
alferez
met
a
man
who
was
carrying
a
bundle
of
firewood
the
road
was
very
muddy
and
there
was
only
a
narrow
path
at
the
side
wide
enough
for
but
one
person
they
say
that
the
alferez
instead
of
reining
in
his
pony
put
spurs
to
it
at
the
same
time
calling
to
the
man
to
get
out
of
the
way
it
seemed
that
this
man
on
account
of
the
heavy
load
he
was
carrying
on
his
shoulder
had
little
relish
for
going
back
nor
did
he
want
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
mud
so
he
continued
on
his
way
forward
the
alferez
in
irritation
tried
to
knock
him
down
but
he
snatched
a
piece
of
wood
from
his
bundle
and
struck
the
pony
on
the
head
with
such
great
force
that
it
fell
throwing
its
rider
into
the
mud
they
also
say
that
the
man
went
on
his
way
tranquilly
without
taking
any
notice
of
the
five
bullets
that
were
fired
after
him
by
the
alferez
who
was
blind
with
mud
and
rage
as
the
man
was
entirely
unknown
to
him
it
was
supposed
that
he
might
be
the
famous
elias
who
came
to
the
province
several
months
ago
having
come
from
no
one
knows
where
he
has
given
the
civil
guard
cause
to
know
him
in
several
towns
for
similar
actions
then
he
a
tulisan
asked
victoria
shuddering
i
do
think
so
for
they
say
that
he
fought
against
some
tulisanes
one
day
when
they
were
robbing
a
house
he
has
the
look
of
a
criminal
commented
sinang
no
but
he
looks
very
sad
i
did
see
him
smile
the
whole
morning
added
maria
clara
thoughtfully
so
the
afternoon
passed
away
and
the
hour
for
returning
to
the
town
came
under
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
they
left
the
woods
passing
in
silence
by
the
mysterious
tomb
of
ancestors
afterwards
the
merry
talk
was
resumed
in
a
lively
manner
full
of
warmth
beneath
those
branches
so
little
accustomed
to
hear
so
many
voices
the
trees
seemed
sad
while
the
vines
swung
back
and
forth
as
if
to
say
farewell
youth
farewell
dream
of
a
day
now
in
the
light
of
the
great
red
torches
of
bamboo
and
with
the
sound
of
the
guitars
let
us
leave
them
on
the
road
to
the
town
the
groups
grow
smaller
the
lights
are
extinguished
the
songs
die
away
and
the
guitar
becomes
silent
as
they
approach
the
abodes
of
men
put
on
the
mask
now
that
you
are
once
more
amongst
your
kind
chapter
xxv
in
the
house
of
the
sage
on
the
morning
of
the
following
day
ibarra
after
visiting
his
lands
made
his
way
to
the
home
of
old
tasio
complete
stillness
reigned
in
the
garden
for
even
the
swallows
circling
about
the
eaves
scarcely
made
any
noise
moss
grew
on
the
old
wall
over
which
a
kind
of
ivy
clambered
to
form
borders
around
the
windows
the
little
house
seemed
to
be
the
abode
of
silence
ibarra
hitched
his
horse
carefully
to
a
post
and
walking
almost
on
tiptoe
crossed
the
clean
and
garden
to
the
stairway
which
he
ascended
and
as
the
door
was
open
he
entered
the
first
sight
that
met
his
gaze
was
the
old
man
bent
over
a
book
in
which
he
seemed
to
be
writing
on
the
walls
were
collections
of
insects
and
plants
arranged
among
maps
and
stands
filled
with
books
and
manuscripts
the
old
man
was
so
absorbed
in
his
work
that
he
did
not
notice
the
presence
of
the
youth
until
the
latter
not
wishing
to
disturb
him
tried
to
retire
ah
you
here
he
asked
gazing
at
ibarra
with
a
strange
expression
excuse
me
answered
the
youth
i
see
that
very
busy
true
i
was
writing
a
little
but
it
not
urgent
and
i
want
to
rest
can
i
do
anything
for
you
a
great
deal
answered
ibarra
drawing
nearer
but
a
glance
at
the
book
on
the
table
caused
him
to
exclaim
in
surprise
what
are
you
given
to
deciphering
hieroglyphics
no
replied
the
old
man
as
he
offered
his
visitor
a
chair
i
understand
egyptian
or
coptic
either
but
i
know
something
about
the
system
of
writing
so
i
write
in
hieroglyphics
you
write
in
hieroglyphics
why
exclaimed
the
youth
doubting
what
he
saw
and
heard
so
that
i
can
not
be
read
now
ibarra
gazed
at
him
fixedly
wondering
to
himself
if
the
old
man
were
not
indeed
crazy
he
examined
the
book
rapidly
to
learn
if
he
was
telling
the
truth
and
saw
neatly
drawn
figures
of
animals
circles
semicircles
flowers
feet
hands
arms
and
such
things
but
why
do
you
write
if
you
do
want
to
be
read
because
i
not
writing
for
this
generation
but
for
other
ages
if
this
generation
could
read
it
would
burn
my
books
the
labor
of
my
whole
life
but
the
generation
that
deciphers
these
characters
will
be
an
intelligent
generation
it
will
understand
and
say
all
were
asleep
in
the
night
of
our
ancestors
the
mystery
of
these
curious
characters
will
save
my
work
from
the
ignorance
of
men
just
as
the
mystery
of
strange
rites
has
saved
many
truths
from
the
destructive
priestly
classes
in
what
language
do
you
write
asked
ibarra
after
a
pause
in
our
own
tagalog
are
the
hieroglyphical
signs
suitable
if
it
were
not
for
the
difficulty
of
drawing
them
which
takes
time
and
patience
i
would
almost
say
that
they
are
more
suitable
than
the
latin
alphabet
the
ancient
egyptian
had
our
vowels
our
which
is
only
final
and
is
not
like
that
of
the
spanish
which
is
a
vowel
between
and
like
us
the
egyptians
lacked
the
true
sound
of
and
in
their
language
are
found
our
and
which
we
do
not
have
in
the
latin
alphabet
such
as
is
used
in
spanish
for
example
in
this
word
he
went
on
pointing
to
the
book
i
transcribe
the
syllable
more
correctly
with
the
figure
of
a
fish
than
with
the
latin
which
in
europe
is
pronounced
in
different
ways
for
a
weaker
aspirate
as
for
example
in
this
word
where
the
has
less
force
i
avail
myself
of
this
head
or
of
these
three
lotus
flowers
according
to
the
quantity
of
the
vowel
besides
i
have
the
nasal
sound
which
does
not
exist
in
the
alphabet
i
repeat
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
difficulty
of
drawing
them
exactly
these
hieroglyphics
could
almost
be
adopted
but
this
same
difficulty
obliges
me
to
be
concise
and
not
say
more
than
what
is
exact
and
necessary
moreover
this
work
keeps
me
company
when
my
guests
from
china
and
japan
go
away
your
guests
from
china
and
japan
do
you
hear
them
my
guests
are
the
swallows
this
year
one
of
them
is
missing
some
bad
boy
in
china
or
japan
must
have
caught
it
how
do
you
know
that
they
come
from
those
countries
easily
enough
several
years
ago
before
they
left
i
tied
to
the
foot
of
each
one
a
slip
of
paper
with
the
name
in
english
on
it
supposing
that
they
must
not
travel
very
far
and
because
english
is
understood
nearly
everywhere
for
years
my
slips
brought
no
reply
so
that
at
last
i
had
it
written
in
chinese
and
here
in
the
following
november
they
have
returned
with
other
notes
which
i
have
had
deciphered
one
is
written
in
chinese
and
is
a
greeting
from
the
banks
of
the
and
the
other
as
the
chinaman
whom
i
consulted
supposes
must
be
in
japanese
but
i
taking
your
time
with
these
things
and
have
asked
you
what
i
can
do
for
you
i
come
to
speak
to
you
about
a
matter
of
importance
said
the
youth
yesterday
afternoon
have
they
caught
that
poor
fellow
you
mean
elias
how
did
you
know
about
him
i
saw
the
muse
of
the
civil
guard
the
muse
of
the
civil
guard
who
is
she
the
alferez
woman
whom
you
did
invite
to
your
picnic
yesterday
morning
the
incident
of
the
cayman
became
known
through
the
town
the
muse
of
the
civil
guard
is
as
astute
as
she
is
malignant
and
she
guessed
that
the
pilot
must
be
the
bold
person
who
threw
her
husband
into
the
mudhole
and
who
assaulted
padre
damaso
as
she
reads
all
the
reports
that
her
husband
is
to
receive
scarcely
had
he
got
back
home
drunk
and
not
knowing
what
he
was
doing
when
to
revenge
herself
on
you
she
sent
the
sergeant
with
the
soldiers
to
disturb
the
merriment
of
your
picnic
be
careful
eve
was
a
good
woman
sprung
from
the
hands
of
god
they
say
that
doña
consolacion
is
evil
and
it
not
known
whose
hands
she
came
from
in
order
to
be
good
a
woman
needs
to
have
been
at
least
sometime
either
a
maid
or
a
mother
ibarra
smiled
slightly
and
replied
by
taking
some
documents
from
his
pocketbook
my
dead
father
used
to
consult
you
in
some
things
and
i
recall
that
he
had
only
to
congratulate
himself
on
following
your
advice
i
have
on
hand
a
little
enterprise
the
success
of
which
i
must
assure
here
he
explained
briefly
his
plan
for
the
school
which
he
had
offered
to
his
fiancée
spreading
out
in
view
of
the
astonished
sage
some
plans
which
had
been
prepared
in
manila
i
would
like
to
have
you
advise
me
as
to
what
persons
in
the
town
i
must
first
win
over
in
order
to
assure
the
success
of
the
undertaking
you
know
the
inhabitants
well
while
i
have
just
arrived
and
am
almost
a
stranger
in
my
own
country
old
tasio
examined
the
plans
before
him
with
eyes
what
you
are
going
to
do
has
been
my
dream
the
dream
of
a
poor
lunatic
he
exclaimed
with
emotion
and
now
the
first
thing
that
i
advise
you
to
do
is
never
to
come
to
consult
with
me
the
youth
gazed
at
him
in
surprise
because
the
sensible
people
he
continued
with
bitter
irony
would
take
you
for
a
madman
also
the
people
consider
madmen
those
who
do
not
think
as
they
do
so
they
hold
me
as
such
which
i
appreciate
because
the
day
in
which
they
think
me
returned
to
sanity
they
will
deprive
me
of
the
little
liberty
that
i
purchased
at
the
expense
of
the
reputation
of
being
a
sane
individual
and
who
knows
but
they
are
right
i
do
not
live
according
to
their
rules
my
principles
and
ideals
are
different
the
gobernadorcillo
enjoys
among
them
the
reputation
of
being
a
wise
man
because
he
learned
nothing
more
than
to
serve
chocolate
and
to
put
up
with
padre
damaso
bad
humor
so
now
he
is
wealthy
he
disturbs
the
petty
destinies
of
his
and
at
times
he
even
talks
of
justice
a
man
of
talent
think
the
vulgar
how
from
nothing
he
has
made
himself
great
but
i
i
inherited
fortune
and
position
i
have
studied
and
now
i
am
poor
i
am
not
trusted
with
the
most
ridiculous
office
and
all
say
a
fool
he
does
know
how
to
live
the
curate
calls
me
as
a
nickname
and
gives
to
understand
that
i
am
a
charlatan
who
is
making
a
show
of
what
i
learned
in
the
higher
schools
when
that
is
exactly
what
benefits
me
the
least
perhaps
i
really
am
the
fool
and
they
the
wise
ones
who
can
say
the
old
man
shook
his
head
as
if
to
drive
away
that
thought
and
continued
the
second
thing
i
can
advise
is
that
you
consult
the
curate
the
gobernadorcillo
and
all
persons
in
authority
they
will
give
you
bad
stupid
or
useless
advice
but
consultation
mean
compliance
although
you
should
make
it
appear
that
you
are
taking
their
advice
and
acting
according
to
it
ibarra
reflected
a
moment
before
he
replied
the
advice
is
good
but
difficult
to
follow
could
i
go
ahead
with
my
idea
without
a
shadow
being
thrown
upon
it
could
a
worthy
enterprise
make
its
way
over
everything
since
truth
does
need
to
borrow
garments
from
error
nobody
loves
the
naked
truth
answered
the
old
man
that
is
good
in
theory
and
practicable
in
the
world
of
which
youth
dreams
here
is
the
schoolmaster
who
has
struggled
in
a
vacuum
with
the
enthusiasm
of
a
child
he
has
sought
the
good
yet
he
has
won
only
jests
and
laughter
you
have
said
that
you
are
a
stranger
in
your
own
country
and
i
believe
it
the
very
first
day
you
arrived
you
began
by
wounding
the
vanity
of
a
priest
who
is
regarded
by
the
people
as
a
saint
and
as
a
sage
among
his
fellows
god
grant
that
such
a
misstep
may
not
have
already
determined
your
future
because
the
dominicans
and
augustinians
look
with
disdain
on
the
habit
the
rope
girdle
and
the
immodest
because
a
learned
doctor
in
santo
tomas
may
have
once
recalled
that
pope
innocent
iii
described
the
statutes
of
that
order
as
more
fit
for
hogs
than
men
do
believe
but
that
all
of
them
work
hand
in
hand
to
affirm
what
a
preacher
once
said
most
insignificant
lay
brother
can
do
more
than
the
government
with
all
its
soldiers
ne
cadas
gold
is
powerful
the
golden
calf
has
thrown
god
down
from
his
altars
many
times
and
that
too
since
the
days
of
moses
i
not
so
pessimistic
nor
does
life
appear
to
me
so
perilous
in
my
country
said
ibarra
with
a
smile
i
believe
that
those
fears
are
somewhat
exaggerated
and
i
hope
to
be
able
to
carry
out
my
plans
without
meeting
any
great
opposition
in
that
quarter
yes
if
they
extend
their
hands
to
you
no
if
they
withhold
them
all
your
efforts
will
be
shattered
against
the
walls
of
the
rectory
if
the
friar
so
much
as
waves
his
girdle
or
shakes
his
habit
tomorrow
the
alcalde
will
on
some
pretext
deny
you
what
today
he
has
granted
no
mother
will
allow
her
son
to
attend
the
school
and
then
all
your
labors
will
produce
a
they
will
dishearten
those
who
afterwards
may
wish
to
attempt
altruistic
undertakings
but
after
all
replied
the
youth
i
ca
believe
in
that
power
of
which
you
speak
and
even
supposing
it
to
exist
and
making
allowance
for
it
i
should
still
have
on
my
side
the
sensible
people
and
the
government
which
is
animated
by
the
best
intentions
which
has
great
hopes
and
which
frankly
desires
the
welfare
of
the
philippines
the
government
the
government
muttered
the
sage
raising
his
eyes
to
stare
at
the
ceiling
however
inspired
it
may
be
with
the
desire
for
fostering
the
greatness
of
the
country
for
the
benefit
of
the
country
itself
and
of
the
mother
country
however
some
official
or
other
may
recall
the
generous
spirit
of
the
catholic
kings
and
may
agree
with
it
too
the
government
sees
nothing
hears
nothing
nor
does
it
decide
anything
except
what
the
curate
or
the
provincial
causes
it
to
see
hear
and
decide
the
government
is
convinced
that
it
depends
for
its
salvation
wholly
on
them
that
it
is
sustained
because
they
uphold
it
and
that
the
day
on
which
they
cease
to
support
it
it
will
fall
like
a
manikin
that
has
lost
its
prop
they
intimidate
the
government
with
an
uprising
of
the
people
and
the
people
with
the
forces
of
the
government
whence
originates
a
simple
game
very
much
like
what
happens
to
timid
persons
when
they
visit
gloomy
places
taking
for
ghosts
their
own
shadows
and
for
strange
voices
the
echoes
of
their
own
as
long
as
the
government
does
not
deal
directly
with
the
country
it
will
not
get
away
from
this
tutelage
it
will
live
like
those
imbecile
youths
who
tremble
at
the
voice
of
their
tutor
whose
kindness
they
are
begging
for
the
government
has
no
dream
of
a
healthy
future
it
is
the
arm
while
the
head
is
the
convento
by
this
inertia
with
which
it
allows
itself
to
be
dragged
from
depth
to
depth
it
becomes
changed
into
a
shadow
its
integrity
is
impaired
and
in
a
weak
and
incapable
way
it
trusts
everything
to
mercenary
hands
but
compare
our
system
of
government
with
those
of
the
countries
you
have
visited
oh
interrupted
ibarra
that
asking
too
much
let
us
content
ourselves
with
observing
that
our
people
do
not
complain
or
suffer
as
do
the
people
of
other
countries
thanks
to
religion
and
the
benignity
of
the
governing
powers
this
people
does
not
complain
because
it
has
no
voice
it
does
not
move
because
it
is
lethargic
and
you
say
that
it
does
not
suffer
because
you
have
seen
how
its
heart
bleeds
but
some
day
you
will
see
this
you
will
hear
its
complaints
and
then
woe
unto
those
who
found
their
strength
on
ignorance
and
fanaticism
woe
unto
those
who
rejoice
in
deceit
and
labor
during
the
night
believing
that
all
are
asleep
when
the
light
of
day
shows
up
the
monsters
of
darkness
the
frightful
reaction
will
come
so
many
sighs
suppressed
so
much
poison
distilled
drop
by
drop
so
much
force
repressed
for
centuries
will
come
to
light
and
burst
who
then
will
pay
those
accounts
which
oppressed
peoples
present
from
time
to
time
and
which
history
preserves
for
us
on
her
bloody
pages
god
the
government
and
religion
will
not
allow
that
day
to
come
replied
ibarra
impressed
in
spite
of
himself
the
philippines
is
religious
and
loves
spain
the
philippines
will
realize
how
much
the
nation
is
doing
for
her
there
are
abuses
yes
there
are
defects
that
can
not
be
denied
but
spain
is
laboring
to
introduce
reforms
that
will
correct
these
abuses
and
defects
she
is
formulating
plans
she
is
not
selfish
i
know
it
and
that
is
the
worst
of
it
the
reforms
which
emanate
from
the
higher
places
are
annulled
in
the
lower
circles
thanks
to
the
vices
of
all
thanks
for
instance
to
the
eager
desire
to
get
rich
in
a
short
time
and
to
the
ignorance
of
the
people
who
consent
to
everything
a
royal
decree
does
not
correct
abuses
when
there
is
no
zealous
authority
to
watch
over
its
execution
while
freedom
of
speech
against
the
insolence
of
petty
tyrants
is
not
conceded
plans
will
remain
plans
abuses
will
still
be
abuses
and
the
satisfied
ministry
will
sleep
in
peace
in
spite
of
everything
moreover
if
perchance
there
does
come
into
a
high
place
a
person
with
great
and
generous
ideas
he
will
begin
to
hear
while
behind
his
back
he
is
considered
a
fool
excellency
does
not
know
the
country
your
excellency
does
not
understand
the
character
of
the
indians
your
excellency
is
going
to
ruin
them
your
excellency
will
do
well
to
trust
and
his
excellency
in
fact
does
not
know
the
country
for
he
has
been
until
now
stationed
in
america
and
besides
that
he
has
all
the
shortcomings
and
weaknesses
of
other
men
so
he
allows
himself
to
be
convinced
his
excellency
also
remembers
that
to
secure
the
appointment
he
has
had
to
sweat
much
and
suffer
more
that
he
holds
it
for
only
three
years
that
he
is
getting
old
and
that
it
is
necessary
to
think
not
of
quixotisms
but
of
the
future
a
modest
mansion
in
madrid
a
cozy
house
in
the
country
and
a
good
income
in
order
to
live
in
luxury
at
the
capital
these
are
what
he
must
look
for
in
the
philippines
let
us
not
ask
for
miracles
let
us
not
ask
that
he
who
comes
as
an
outsider
to
make
his
fortune
and
go
away
afterwards
should
interest
himself
in
the
welfare
of
the
country
what
matters
to
him
the
gratitude
or
the
curses
of
a
people
whom
he
does
not
know
in
a
country
where
he
has
no
associations
where
he
has
no
affections
fame
to
be
sweet
must
resound
in
the
ears
of
those
we
love
in
the
atmosphere
of
our
home
or
of
the
land
that
will
guard
our
ashes
we
wish
that
fame
should
hover
over
our
tomb
to
warm
with
its
breath
the
chill
of
death
so
that
we
may
not
be
completely
reduced
to
nothingness
that
something
of
us
may
survive
naught
of
this
can
we
offer
to
those
who
come
to
watch
over
our
destinies
and
the
worst
of
all
this
is
that
they
go
away
just
when
they
are
beginning
to
get
an
understanding
of
their
duties
but
we
are
getting
away
from
our
subject
but
before
getting
back
to
it
i
must
make
some
things
plain
interrupted
the
youth
eagerly
i
can
admit
that
the
government
does
not
know
the
people
but
i
believe
that
the
people
know
the
government
even
less
there
are
useless
officials
bad
ones
if
you
wish
but
there
are
also
good
ones
and
if
these
are
unable
to
do
anything
it
is
because
they
meet
with
an
inert
mass
the
people
who
take
little
part
in
the
affairs
that
concern
them
but
i
did
come
to
hold
a
discussion
with
you
on
that
point
i
came
to
ask
for
advice
and
you
tell
me
to
lower
my
head
before
grotesque
idols
yes
i
repeat
it
because
here
you
must
either
lower
your
head
or
lose
it
either
lower
my
head
or
lose
it
repeated
ibarra
thoughtfully
the
dilemma
is
hard
but
why
is
love
for
my
country
incompatible
with
love
for
spain
is
it
necessary
to
debase
oneself
to
be
a
good
christian
to
prostitute
one
conscience
in
order
to
carry
out
a
good
purpose
i
love
my
native
land
the
philippines
because
to
it
i
owe
my
life
and
my
happiness
because
every
man
should
love
his
country
i
love
spain
the
fatherland
of
my
ancestors
because
in
spite
of
everything
the
philippines
owes
to
it
and
will
continue
to
owe
her
happiness
and
her
future
i
am
a
catholic
i
preserve
pure
the
faith
of
my
fathers
and
i
do
not
see
why
i
have
to
lower
my
head
when
i
can
raise
it
to
give
it
over
to
my
enemies
when
i
can
humble
them
because
the
field
in
which
you
wish
to
sow
is
in
possession
of
your
enemies
and
against
them
you
are
powerless
it
is
necessary
that
you
first
kiss
the
hand
that
but
the
youth
let
him
go
no
farther
exclaiming
passionately
kiss
their
hands
you
forget
that
among
them
they
killed
my
father
and
threw
his
body
from
the
tomb
i
who
am
his
son
do
not
forget
it
and
that
i
do
not
avenge
it
is
because
i
have
regard
for
the
good
name
of
the
church
the
old
sage
bowed
his
head
as
he
answered
slowly
señor
ibarra
if
you
preserve
those
memories
which
i
can
not
counsel
you
to
forget
abandon
the
enterprise
you
are
undertaking
and
seek
in
some
other
way
the
welfare
of
your
countrymen
the
enterprise
needs
another
man
because
to
make
it
a
success
zeal
and
money
alone
are
not
sufficient
in
our
country
are
required
also
tenacity
of
purpose
and
faith
for
the
soil
is
not
ready
it
is
only
sown
with
discord
ibarra
appreciated
the
value
of
these
observations
but
still
would
not
be
discouraged
the
thought
of
maria
clara
was
in
his
mind
and
his
promise
must
be
fulfilled
does
your
experience
suggest
any
other
than
this
hard
means
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
the
old
man
took
him
by
the
arm
and
led
him
to
the
window
a
fresh
breeze
the
precursor
of
the
north
wind
was
blowing
and
before
their
eyes
spread
out
the
garden
bounded
by
the
wide
forest
that
was
a
kind
of
park
why
can
we
not
do
as
that
weak
stalk
laden
with
flowers
and
buds
does
asked
the
sage
pointing
to
a
beautiful
jasmine
plant
the
wind
blows
and
shakes
it
and
it
bows
its
head
as
if
to
hide
its
precious
load
if
the
stalk
should
hold
itself
erect
it
would
be
broken
its
flowers
would
be
scattered
by
the
wind
and
its
buds
would
be
blighted
the
wind
passes
by
and
the
stalk
raises
itself
erect
proud
of
its
treasure
yet
who
will
blame
it
for
having
bowed
before
necessity
there
you
see
that
gigantic
which
majestically
waves
its
light
foliage
wherein
the
eagle
builds
his
nest
i
brought
it
from
the
forest
as
a
weak
sapling
and
braced
its
stem
for
months
with
slender
pieces
of
bamboo
if
i
had
transplanted
it
large
and
full
of
life
it
is
certain
that
it
would
not
have
lived
here
for
the
wind
would
have
thrown
it
down
before
its
roots
could
have
fixed
themselves
in
the
soil
before
it
could
have
become
accustomed
to
its
surroundings
and
before
it
could
have
secured
sufficient
nourishment
for
its
size
and
height
so
you
transplanted
from
europe
to
this
stony
soil
may
end
if
you
do
not
seek
support
and
do
not
humble
yourself
you
are
among
evil
conditions
alone
elevated
the
ground
shakes
the
sky
presages
a
storm
and
the
top
of
your
family
tree
has
shown
that
it
draws
the
thunderbolt
it
is
not
courage
but
foolhardiness
to
fight
alone
against
all
that
exists
no
one
censures
the
pilot
who
makes
for
a
port
at
the
first
gust
of
the
whirlwind
to
stoop
as
the
bullet
passes
is
not
cowardly
it
is
worse
to
defy
it
only
to
fall
never
to
rise
again
but
could
this
sacrifice
produce
the
fruit
that
i
hope
for
asked
ibarra
would
the
priest
believe
in
me
and
forget
the
affront
would
they
aid
me
frankly
in
behalf
of
the
education
that
contests
with
the
conventos
the
wealth
of
the
country
can
they
not
pretend
friendship
make
a
show
of
protection
and
yet
underneath
in
the
shadows
fight
it
undermine
it
wound
it
in
the
heel
in
order
to
weaken
it
quicker
than
by
attacking
it
in
front
granted
the
previous
actions
which
you
surmise
anything
may
be
expected
the
old
man
remained
silent
from
inability
to
answer
these
questions
after
meditating
for
some
time
he
said
if
such
should
happen
if
the
enterprise
should
fail
you
would
be
consoled
by
the
thought
that
you
had
done
what
was
expected
of
you
and
thus
something
would
be
gained
you
would
have
placed
the
first
stone
you
would
have
sown
the
seed
and
after
the
storm
had
spent
itself
perhaps
some
grain
would
have
survived
the
catastrophe
to
grow
and
save
the
species
from
destruction
and
to
serve
afterwards
as
the
seed
for
the
sons
of
the
dead
sower
the
example
may
encourage
others
who
are
only
afraid
to
begin
weighing
these
reasons
ibarra
realized
the
situation
and
saw
that
with
all
the
old
man
pessimism
there
was
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
what
he
said
i
believe
you
he
exclaimed
pressing
the
old
man
hand
not
in
vain
have
i
looked
to
you
for
advice
this
very
day
i
go
and
reach
an
understanding
with
the
curate
who
after
all
is
said
has
done
me
no
wrong
and
who
must
be
good
since
all
of
them
are
not
like
the
persecutor
of
my
father
i
have
besides
to
interest
him
in
behalf
of
that
unfortunate
madwoman
and
her
sons
i
put
my
trust
in
god
and
men
after
taking
leave
of
the
old
man
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
as
the
pessimistic
sage
followed
him
with
his
gaze
he
muttered
now
let
watch
how
destiny
will
unfold
the
drama
that
began
in
the
cemetery
but
for
once
he
was
greatly
mistaken
the
drama
had
begun
long
before
chapter
xxvi
the
eve
of
the
fiesta
it
is
now
the
tenth
of
november
the
eve
of
the
fiesta
emerging
from
its
habitual
monotony
the
town
has
given
itself
over
to
unwonted
activity
in
house
church
cockpit
and
field
windows
are
covered
with
banners
and
draperies
all
space
is
filled
with
noise
and
music
and
the
air
is
saturated
with
rejoicings
on
little
tables
with
embroidered
covers
the
arrange
in
glass
dishes
different
kinds
of
sweetmeats
made
from
native
fruits
in
the
yard
the
hens
cackle
the
cocks
crow
and
the
hogs
grunt
all
terrified
by
this
merriment
of
man
servants
move
in
and
out
carrying
fancy
dishes
and
silver
cutlery
here
there
is
a
quarrel
over
a
broken
plate
there
they
laugh
at
the
simple
country
girl
everywhere
there
is
ordering
whispering
shouting
comments
and
conjectures
are
made
one
hurries
the
other
all
is
commotion
noise
and
confusion
all
this
effort
and
all
this
toil
are
for
the
stranger
as
well
as
the
acquaintance
to
entertain
every
one
whether
he
has
been
seen
before
or
not
or
whether
he
is
expected
to
be
seen
again
in
order
that
the
casual
visitor
the
foreigner
friend
enemy
filipino
spaniard
the
poor
and
the
rich
may
go
away
happy
and
contented
no
gratitude
is
even
asked
of
them
nor
is
it
expected
that
they
do
no
damage
to
the
hospitable
family
either
during
or
after
digestion
the
rich
those
who
have
ever
been
to
manila
and
have
seen
a
little
more
than
their
neighbors
have
bought
beer
champagne
liqueurs
wines
and
from
europe
of
which
they
will
hardly
taste
a
bite
or
drink
a
drop
their
tables
are
luxuriously
furnished
in
the
center
is
a
artificial
pineapple
in
which
are
arranged
toothpicks
elaborately
carved
by
convicts
in
their
here
they
have
designed
a
fan
there
a
bouquet
of
flowers
a
bird
a
rose
a
palm
leaf
or
a
chain
all
wrought
from
a
single
piece
of
wood
the
artisan
being
a
forced
laborer
the
tool
a
dull
knife
and
the
taskmaster
voice
the
inspiration
around
this
are
placed
glass
from
which
rise
pyramids
of
oranges
lansons
ates
chicos
and
even
mangos
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
is
november
on
wide
platters
upon
sheets
of
perforated
paper
are
to
be
seen
hams
from
europe
and
china
stuffed
turkeys
and
a
big
pastry
in
the
shape
of
an
agnus
dei
or
a
dove
the
holy
ghost
perhaps
among
all
these
are
jars
of
appetizing
with
fanciful
decorations
made
from
the
flowers
of
the
areca
palm
and
other
fruits
and
vegetables
all
tastefully
cut
and
fastened
with
sirup
to
the
sides
of
the
flasks

globes
that
have
been
handed
down
from
father
to
son
are
cleaned
the
copper
ornaments
polished
the
kerosene
lamps
taken
out
of
the
red
wrappings
which
have
protected
them
from
the
flies
and
mosquitoes
during
the
year
and
which
have
made
them
unserviceable
the
prismatic
glass
pendants
shake
to
and
fro
they
clink
together
harmoniously
in
song
and
even
seem
to
take
part
in
the
fiesta
as
they
flash
back
and
break
up
the
rays
of
light
reflecting
them
on
the
white
walls
in
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
the
children
play
about
amusing
themselves
by
chasing
the
colors
they
stumble
and
break
the
globes
but
this
does
not
interfere
with
the
general
merriment
although
at
other
times
in
the
year
the
tears
in
their
round
eyes
would
be
taken
account
of
in
a
different
way
along
with
these
venerated
lamps
there
also
come
forth
from
their
the
work
of
the
girls
crocheted
scarfs
rugs
artificial
flowers
there
appear
old
glass
trays
on
the
bottoms
of
which
are
sketched
miniature
lakes
with
little
fishes
caymans
seaweeds
coral
and
glassy
stones
of
brilliant
hues
these
are
heaped
with
cigars
cigarettes
and
diminutive
buyos
prepared
by
the
delicate
fingers
of
the
maidens
the
floor
of
the
house
shines
like
a
mirror
curtains
of
piña
and
husi
festoon
the
doorways
from
the
windows
hang
lanterns
covered
with
glass
or
with
paper
pink
blue
green
or
red
the
house
itself
is
filled
with
plants
and
on
stands
of
chinese
porcelain
even
the
saints
bedeck
themselves
the
images
and
relics
put
on
a
festive
air
the
dust
is
brushed
from
them
and
on
the
glass
of
their
cases
are
hung
flowery
garlands
in
the
streets
are
raised
at
intervals
fanciful
bamboo
arches
known
as
constructed
in
various
ways
and
adorned
with
the
curling
bunches
of
shavings
scraped
on
their
sides
at
the
sight
of
which
alone
the
hearts
of
the
children
rejoice
about
the
front
of
the
church
where
the
procession
is
to
pass
is
a
large
and
costly
canopy
upheld
on
bamboo
posts
beneath
this
the
children
run
and
play
climbing
jumping
and
tearing
the
new
camisas
in
which
they
should
shine
on
the
principal
day
of
the
fiesta
there
on
the
plaza
a
platform
has
been
erected
the
scenery
being
of
bamboo
nipa
and
wood
there
the
tondo
comedians
will
perform
wonders
and
compete
with
the
gods
in
improbable
miracles
there
will
sing
and
dance
marianito
chananay
balbino
ratia
carvajal
yeyeng
liceria
etc
the
filipino
enjoys
the
theater
and
is
a
deeply
interested
spectator
of
dramatic
representations
but
he
listens
in
silence
to
the
song
he
gazes
delighted
at
the
dancing
and
mimicry
he
never
hisses
or
applauds
if
the
show
is
not
to
his
liking
he
chews
his
buyo
or
withdraws
without
disturbing
the
others
who
perhaps
find
pleasure
in
it
only
at
times
the
commoner
sort
will
howl
when
the
actors
embrace
or
kiss
the
actresses
but
they
never
go
beyond
that
formerly
dramas
only
were
played
the
local
poet
composed
a
piece
in
which
there
must
necessarily
be
a
fight
every
second
minute
a
clown
and
terrifying
transformations
but
since
the
tondo
artist
have
begun
to
fight
every
fifteen
seconds
with
two
clowns
and
even
greater
marvels
than
before
they
have
put
to
rout
their
provincial
compeers
the
gobernadorcillo
was
very
fond
of
this
sort
of
thing
so
with
the
approval
of
the
curate
he
chose
a
spectacle
with
magic
and
fireworks
entitled
the
prince
villardo
or
the
captives
rescued
from
the
infamous
cave
from
time
to
time
the
bells
chime
out
merrily
those
same
bells
that
ten
days
ago
were
tolling
so
mournfully
and
mortars
rend
the
air
for
the
filipino
pyrotechnist
who
learned
the
art
from
no
known
instructor
displays
his
ability
by
preparing
fire
bulls
castles
of
bengal
lights
paper
balloons
inflated
with
hot
air
bombs
rockets
and
the
like
now
distant
strains
of
music
are
heard
and
the
small
boys
rush
headlong
toward
the
outskirts
of
the
town
to
meet
the
bands
of
music
five
of
which
have
been
engaged
as
well
as
three
orchestras
the
band
of
pagsanhan
belonging
to
the
escribano
must
not
be
lacking
nor
that
of
san
pedro
de
tunasan
at
that
time
famous
because
it
was
directed
by
the
maestro
austria
the
vagabond
corporal
mariano
who
according
to
report
carried
fame
and
harmony
in
the
tip
of
his
baton
musicians
praise
his
funeral
march
el
sauce
and
deplore
his
lack
of
musical
education
since
with
his
genius
he
might
have
brought
glory
to
his
country
the
bands
enter
the
town
playing
lively
airs
followed
by
ragged
or
urchins
one
in
the
camisa
of
his
brother
another
in
his
father
pantaloons
as
soon
as
the
band
ceases
the
boys
know
the
piece
by
heart
they
hum
and
whistle
it
with
rare
skill
they
pronounce
their
judgment
upon
it
meanwhile
there
are
arriving
in
conveyances
of
all
kinds
relatives
friends
strangers
the
gamblers
with
their
best
and
their
bags
of
gold
ready
to
risk
their
fortune
on
the
green
cloth
or
within
the
arena
of
the
cockpit
the
alferez
has
fifty
pesos
for
each
night
murmurs
a
small
chubby

into
the

carlos
the
chinaman
will
loosen
up
also
here
the
chubby
individual
works
his
fingers
as
though
counting
out
pieces
of
money
outside
the
town
the
the

putting
on
their
best
clothes
to

to
the
houses
of
their
landlords
chickens
wild
pigs
deer
and
birds
some
load
firewood
on
the
heavy
carts
others
fruits
ferns
and
orchids
the
rarest
that
grow
in
the
forests
others
bring
caladiums
and
blossoms
to
decorate
the
doors
of
the
houses
but
the
place
where
the
greatest
activity
reigns
where
it
is
converted
into
a
tumult
is
there
on
a
little
plot
of
raised
ground
a
few
steps
from
ibarra
house
pulleys
screech
and
yells
are
heard
amid
the
metallic
sound
of
iron
striking
upon
stone
hammers
upon
nails
of
axes
chopping
out
posts
a
crowd
of
laborers
is
digging
in
the
earth
to
open
a
wide
deep
trench
while
others
place
in
line
the
stones
taken
from
the
town
quarries
carts
are
unloaded
piles
of
sand
are
heaped
up
windlasses
and
derricks
are
set
in
place
hey
you
there
hurry
up
cries
a
little
old
man
with
lively
and
intelligent
features
who
has
for
a
cane
a
rule
around
which
is
wound
the
cord
of
a
this
is
the
foreman
of
the
work
ñor
juan
architect
mason
carpenter
painter
locksmith
stonecutter
and
on
occasions
sculptor
it
must
be
finished
right
now
tomorrow
there
be
no
work
and
the
day
after
tomorrow
is
the
ceremony
hurry
cut
that
hole
so
that
this
cylinder
will
fit
it
exactly
he
says
to
some
masons
who
are
shaping
a
large
square
block
of
stone
within
that
our
names
will
be
preserved
he
repeats
to
every
newcomer
who
approaches
the
place
what
he
has
already
said
a
thousand
times
you
know
what
we
going
to
build
well
it
a
schoolhouse
a
model
of
its
kind
like
those
in
germany
and
even
better
a
great
architect
has
drawn
the
plans
and
i
i
am
bossing
the
job
yes
sir
look
at
it
it
going
to
be
a
palace
with
two
wings
one
for
the
boys
and
the
other
for
the
girls
here
in
the
middle
a
big
garden
with
three
fountains
there
on
the
sides
shaded
walks
with
little
plots
for
the
children
to
sow
and
cultivate
plants
in
during
their
that
they
may
improve
the
hours
and
not
waste
them
look
how
deep
the
foundations
are
three
meters
and
centimeters
this
building
is
going
to
have
storerooms
cellars
and
for
those
who
are
not
diligent
students
dungeons
near
the
playgrounds
so
that
the
culprits
may
hear
how
the
studious
children
are
enjoying
themselves
do
you
see
that
big
space
that
will
be
a
lawn
for
running
and
exercising
in
the
open
air
the
little
girls
will
have
a
garden
with
benches
swings
walks
where
they
can
jump
the
rope
fountains
and
so
on
it
going
to
be
magnificent
then
ñor
juan
would
rub
his
hands
together
as
he
thought
of
the
fame
that
he
was
going
to
acquire
strangers
would
come
to
see
it
and
would
ask
who
was
the
great
artisan
that
built
this
and
all
would
answer
do
you
know
can
it
be
that
you
never
heard
of
ñor
juan
undoubtedly
you
come
from
a
great
distance
with
these
thoughts
he
moved
from
one
part
to
the
other
examining
and
reexamining
everything
it
seems
to
me
that
there
too
much
timber
for
one
derrick
he
remarked
to
a
yellowish
man
who
was
overseeing
some
laborers
i
should
have
enough
with
three
large
beams
for
the
tripod
and
three
more
for
the
braces
never
mind
answered
the
yellowish
man
smiling
in
a
peculiar
way
the
more
apparatus
we
use
in
the
work
so
much
the
greater
effect
we
get
the
whole
thing
will
look
better
and
of
more
importance
so
they
say
hard
they
worked
you
see
you
see
what
a
derrick
i
put
up
then
i
decorate
it
with
banners
and
garlands
of
leaves
and
flowers
you
say
afterwards
that
you
were
right
in
hiring
me
as
one
of
your
laborers
and
señor
ibarra
ask
for
more
as
he
said
this
the
man
laughed
and
smiled
ñor
juan
also
smiled
but
shook
his
head
some
distance
away
were
seen
two
kiosks
united
by
a
kind
of
arbor
covered
with
banana
leaves
the
schoolmaster
and
some
thirty
boys
were
weaving
crowns
and
fastening
banners
upon
the
frail
bamboo
posts
which
were
wrapped
in
white
cloth
take
care
that
the
letters
are
well
written
he
admonished
the
boys
who
were
preparing
inscriptions
the
alcalde
is
coming
many
curates
will
be
present
perhaps
even
the
who
is
now
in
the
province
if
they
see
that
you
draw
well
maybe
they
praise
you
and
give
us
a
blackboard
perhaps
but
señor
ibarra
has
already
ordered
one
from
manila
tomorrow
some
things
will
come
to
be
distributed
among
you
as
prizes
leave
those
flowers
in
the
water
and
tomorrow
we
make
the
bouquets
bring
more
flowers
for
it
necessary
that
the
table
be
covered
with
them
flowers
please
the
eye
my
father
will
bring
some
and
a
basket
of
sampaguitas
tomorrow
mine
has
brought
three
cartloads
of
sand
without
pay
my
uncle
has
promised
to
pay
a
teacher
added
a
nephew
of
capitan
basilio
truly
the
project
was
receiving
help
from
all
the
curate
had
asked
to
stand
sponsor
for
it
and
himself
bless
the
laying
of
the
a
ceremony
to
take
place
on
the
last
day
of
the
fiesta
as
one
of
its
greatest
solemnities
the
very
coadjutor
had
timidly
approached
ibarra
with
an
offer
of
all
the
fees
for
masses
that
the
devout
would
pay
until
the
building
was
finished
even
more
the
rich
and
economical
sister
rufa
had
declared
that
if
money
should
be
lacking
she
would
canvass
other
towns
and
beg
for
alms
with
the
mere
condition
that
she
be
paid
her
expenses
for
travel
and
subsistence
ibarra
thanked
them
all
as
he
answered
we
are
going
to
have
anything
very
great
since
i
am
not
rich
and
this
building
is
not
a
church
besides
i
did
undertake
to
erect
it
at
the
expense
of
others
the
younger
men
students
from
manila
who
had
come
to
take
part
in
the
fiesta
gazed
at
him
in
admiration
and
took
him
for
a
model
but
as
it
nearly
always
happens
when
we
wish
to
imitate
great
men
that
we
copy
only
their
foibles
and
even
their
defects
since
we
are
capable
of
nothing
else
so
many
of
these
admirers
took
note
of
the
way
in
which
he
tied
his
cravat
others
of
the
style
of
his
collar
and
not
a
few
of
the
number
of
buttons
on
his
coat
and
vest
the
funereal
presentiments
of
old
tasio
seemed
to
have
been
dissipated
forever
so
ibarra
observed
to
him
one
day
but
the
old
pessimist
answered
remember
what
baltazar
says
kung
ang
isalúbong
sa
iyong
pagdating
ay
masayang
may
pakitang
giliw
lalong
kaaway
na
lihim
baltazar
was
no
less
a
thinker
than
a
poet
thus
in
the
gathering
shadows
before
the
setting
of
the
sun
events
were
shaping
themselves
chapter
xxvii
in
the
twilight
in
capitan
tiago
house
also
great
preparations
had
been
made
we
know
its
owner
whose
love
of
ostentation
and
whose
pride
as
a
manilan
imposed
the
necessity
of
humiliating
the
provincials
with
his
splendor
another
reason
too
made
it
his
duty
to
eclipse
all
others
he
had
his
daughter
maria
clara
with
him
and
there
was
present
his
future
who
was
attracting
universal
attention
in
fact
one
of
the
most
serious
newspapers
in
manila
had
devoted
to
ibarra
an
article
on
its
front
page
entitled
imitate
him
heaping
him
with
praise
and
giving
him
some
advice
it
had
called
him
the
cultivated
young
gentleman
and
rich
capitalist
two
lines
further
on
the
distinguished
philanthropist
in
the
following
paragraph
the
disciple
of
minerva
who
had
gone
to
the
mother
country
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
true
home
of
the
arts
and
sciences
and
a
little
further
on
the
filipino
spaniard
capitan
tiago
burned
with
generous
zeal
to
imitate
him
and
wondered
whether
he
ought
not
to
erect
a
convento
at
his
own
expense
some
days
before
there
had
arrived
at
the
house
where
maria
clara
and
aunt
isabel
were
staying
a
profusion
of
eases
of
european
wines
and
colossal
mirrors
paintings
and
maria
piano
capitan
tiago
had
arrived
on
the
day
before
the
fiesta
and
as
his
daughter
kissed
his
hand
had
presented
her
with
a
beautiful
locket
set
with
diamonds
and
emeralds
containing
a
sliver
from
boat
in
which
our
savior
sat
during
the
fishing
his
first
interview
with
his
future
could
not
have
been
more
cordial
naturally
they
talked
about
the
school
and
capitan
tiago
wanted
it
named
school
of
st
francis
believe
me
he
said
francis
is
a
good
patron
if
you
call
it
of
primary
instruction
you
will
gain
nothing
who
is
primary
instruction
anyhow
some
friends
of
maria
clara
came
and
asked
her
to
go
for
a
walk
but
come
back
quickly
said
capitan
tiago
to
his
daughter
when
she
asked
his
permission
for
you
know
that
padre
damaso
who
has
just
arrived
will
dine
with
us
then
turning
to
ibarra
who
had
become
thoughtful
he
said
you
dine
with
us
also
you
be
all
alone
in
your
house
i
would
with
the
greatest
pleasure
but
i
have
to
be
at
home
in
case
visitors
come
stammered
the
youth
as
he
avoided
the
gaze
of
maria
clara
bring
your
friends
along
replied
capitan
tiago
heartily
in
my
house
there
always
plenty
to
eat
also
i
want
you
and
padre
damaso
to
get
on
good
terms
there
be
time
enough
for
that
answered
ibarra
with
a
forced
smile
as
he
prepared
to
accompany
the
girls
they
went
downstairs
maria
clara
in
the
center
between
victoria
and
iday
aunt
isabel
following
the
people
made
way
for
them
respectfully
maria
clara
was
startling
in
her
beauty
her
pallor
was
all
gone
and
if
her
eyes
were
still
pensive
her
mouth
on
the
contrary
seemed
to
know
only
smiles
with
maiden
friendliness
the
happy
young
woman
greeted
the
acquaintances
of
her
childhood
now
the
admirers
of
her
promising
youth
in
less
than
a
fortnight
she
had
succeeded
in
recovering
that
frank
confidence
that
childish
prattle
which
seemed
to
have
been
benumbed
between
the
narrow
walls
of
the
nunnery
it
might
be
said
that
on
leaving
the
cocoon
the
butterfly
recognized
all
the
flowers
for
it
seemed
to
be
enough
for
her
to
spread
her
wings
for
a
moment
and
warm
herself
in
the
sun
rays
to
lose
all
the
stiffness
of
the
chrysalis
this
new
life
manifested
itself
in
her
whole
nature
everything
she
found
good
and
beautiful
and
she
showed
her
love
with
that
maiden
modesty
which
having
never
been
conscious
of
any
but
pure
thoughts
knows
not
the
meaning
of
false
blushes
while
she
would
cover
her
face
when
she
was
teased
still
her
eyes
smiled
and
a
light
thrill
would
course
through
her
whole
being
the
houses
were
beginning
to
show
lights
and
in
the
streets
where
the
music
was
moving
about
there
were
lighted
torches
of
bamboo
and
wood
made
in
imitation
of
those
in
the
church
from
the
streets
the
people
in
the
houses
might
be
seen
through
the
windows
in
an
atmosphere
of
music
and
flowers
moving
about
to
the
sounds
of
piano
harp
or
orchestra
swarming
in
the
streets
were
chinese
spaniards
filipinos
some
dressed
in
european
style
some
in
the
costumes
of
the
country
crowding
elbowing
and
pushing
one
another
walked
servants
carrying
meat
and
chickens
students
in
white
men
and
women
all
exposing
themselves
to
be
knocked
down
by
the
carriages
which
in
spite
of
the
drivers
cries
made
their
way
with
difficulty
in
front
of
capitan
basilio
house
some
young
women
called
to
our
acquaintances
and
invited
them
to
enter
the
merry
voice
of
sinang
as
she
ran
down
the
stairs
put
an
end
to
all
excuses
come
up
a
moment
so
that
i
may
go
with
you
she
said
i
bored
staying
here
among
so
many
strangers
who
talk
only
of
and
cards
they
were
ushered
into
a
large
room
filled
with
people
some
of
whom
came
forward
to
greet
ibarra
for
his
name
was
now
well
known
all
gazed
in
ecstasy
at
the
beauty
of
maria
clara
and
some
old
women
murmured
as
they
chewed
their
buyo
she
looks
like
the
virgin
there
they
had
to
have
chocolate
as
capitan
basilio
had
become
a
warm
friend
and
defender
of
ibarra
since
the
day
of
the
picnic
he
had
learned
from
the
half
of
the
telegram
given
to
his
daughter
sinang
that
ibarra
had
known
beforehand
about
the
court
decision
in
the
latter
favor
so
not
wishing
to
be
outdone
in
generosity
he
had
tried
to
set
aside
the
decision
of
the
but
when
ibarra
would
not
consent
to
this
he
had
proposed
that
the
money
which
would
have
been
spent
in
court
fees
should
be
used
to
pay
a
teacher
in
the
new
school
in
consequence
the
orator
employed
all
his
eloquence
to
the
end
that
other
litigants
should
give
up
their
extravagant
claims
saying
to
them
believe
me
in
a
lawsuit
the
winner
is
left
without
a
camisa
but
he
had
succeeded
in
convincing
no
one
even
though
he
cited
the
romans
after
drinking
the
chocolate
our
young
people
had
to
listen
to
by
the
town
organist
when
i
listen
to
him
in
the
church
exclaimed
sinang
pointing
to
the
organist
i
want
to
dance
and
now
that
he
playing
here
i
feel
like
praying
so
i
going
out
with
you
do
you
want
to
join
us
tonight
whispered
capitan
basilio
into
ibarra
ear
as
they
were
leaving
padre
damaso
is
going
to
set
up
a
little
bank
ibarra
smiled
and
answered
with
an
equivocal
shake
of
his
head
who
that
asked
maria
clara
of
victoria
indicating
with
a
rapid
glance
a
youth
who
was
following
them
he
he
a
cousin
of
mine
she
answered
with
some
agitation
and
the
other
he
no
cousin
of
mine
put
in
sinang
merrily
he
my
uncle
son
they
passed
in
front
of
the
parish
rectory
which
was
not
one
of
the
least
animated
buildings
sinang
was
unable
to
repress
an
exclamation
of
surprise
on
seeing
the
lamps
burning
those
lamps
of
antique
pattern
which
padre
salvi
had
never
allowed
to
be
lighted
in
order
not
to
waste
kerosene
loud
talk
and
resounding
bursts
of
laughter
might
be
heard
as
the
friars
moved
slowly
about
nodding
their
heads
in
unison
with
the
big
cigars
that
adorned
their
lips
the
laymen
with
them
who
from
their
european
garments
appeared
to
be
officials
and
employees
of
the
province
were
endeavoring
to
imitate
whatever
the
good
priests
did
maria
clara
made
out
the
rotund
figure
of
padre
damaso
at
the
side
of
the
trim
silhouette
of
padre
sibyla
motionless
in
his
place
stood
the
silent
and
mysterious
fray
salvi
he
sad
observed
sinang
for
he
thinking
about
how
much
so
many
visitors
are
going
to
cost
but
you
see
how
he
not
pay
it
himself
but
the
sacristans
will
his
visitors
always
eat
at
other
places
sinang
scolded
victoria
i
have
been
able
to
endure
him
since
he
tore
up
the
of
i
do
go
to
confession
to
him
any
more
of
all
the
houses
one
only
was
to
be
noticed
without
lights
and
with
all
the
windows
closed
that
of
the
alferez
maria
clara
expressed
surprise
at
this
the
witch
the
muse
of
the
civil
guard
as
the
old
man
says
exclaimed
the
irrepressible
sinang
what
has
she
to
do
with
our
merrymakings
i
imagine
she
raging
but
just
let
the
cholera
come
and
you
see
her
give
a
banquet
but
sinang
again
her
cousin
scolded
i
never
was
able
to
endure
her
and
especially
since
she
disturbed
our
picnic
with
her
if
i
were
the
archbishop
i
marry
her
to
padre
salvi
then
think
what
children
look
how
she
tried
to
arrest
the
poor
pilot
who
threw
himself
into
the
water
simply
to
please
she
was
not
allowed
to
finish
for
in
the
corner
of
the
plaza
where
a
blind
man
was
singing
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
guitar
a
curious
spectacle
was
presented
it
was
a
man
miserably
dressed
wearing
a
broad
salakot
of
palm
leaves
his
clothing
consisted
of
a
ragged
coat
and
wide
pantaloons
like
those
worn
by
the
chinese
torn
in
many
places
wretched
sandals
covered
his
feet
his
countenance
remained
hidden
in
the
shadow
of
his
wide
hat
but
from
this
shadow
there
flashed
intermittently
two
burning
rays
placing
a
flat
basket
on
the
ground
he
would
withdraw
a
few
paces
and
utter
strange
incomprehensible
sounds
remaining
the
while
standing
entirely
alone
as
if
he
and
the
crowd
were
mutually
avoiding
each
other
then
some
women
would
approach
the
basket
and
put
into
it
fruit
fish
or
rice
when
no
one
any
longer
approached
from
the
shadows
would
issue
sadder
but
less
pitiful
sounds
cries
of
gratitude
perhaps
then
he
would
take
up
the
basket
and
make
his
way
to
another
place
to
repeat
the
same
performance
maria
clara
divined
that
there
must
be
some
misfortune
there
and
full
of
interest
she
asked
concerning
the
strange
creature
he
a
leper
iday
told
her
four
years
ago
he
contracted
the
disease
some
say
from
taking
care
of
his
mother
others
from
lying
in
a
damp
prison
he
lives
in
the
fields
near
the
chinese
cemetery
having
intercourse
with
no
one
because
all
flee
from
him
for
fear
of
contagion
if
you
might
only
see
his
home
it
a
tumbledown
shack
through
which
the
wind
and
rain
pass
like
a
needle
through
cloth
he
has
been
forbidden
to
touch
anything
belonging
to
the
people
one
day
when
a
little
child
fell
into
a
shallow
ditch
as
he
was
passing
he
helped
to
get
it
out
the
child
father
complained
to
the
gobernadorcillo
who
ordered
that
the
leper
be
flogged
through
the
streets
and
that
the
rattan
be
burned
afterwards
it
was
horrible
the
leper
fled
with
his
flogger
in
pursuit
while
the
gobernadorcillo
cried
him
better
be
drowned
than
get
the
disease
you
have
can
it
be
true
murmured
maria
clara
then
without
saying
what
she
was
about
to
do
went
up
to
the
wretch
basket
and
dropped
into
it
the
locket
her
father
had
given
her
what
have
you
done
her
friends
asked
i
had
anything
else
she
answered
trying
to
conceal
her
tears
with
a
smile
what
is
he
going
to
do
with
your
locket
victoria
asked
her
one
day
they
gave
him
some
money
but
he
pushed
it
away
with
a
stick
why
should
he
want
it
when
no
one
accepts
anything
that
comes
from
him
as
if
the
locket
could
be
eaten
maria
clara
gazed
enviously
at
the
women
who
were
selling
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
the
leper
approached
the
basket
picked
up
the
jeweled
locket
which
glittered
in
his
hands
then
fell
upon
his
knees
kissed
it
and
taking
off
his
salakot
buried
his
forehead
in
the
dust
where
the
maiden
had
stepped
maria
clara
hid
her
face
behind
her
fan
and
raised
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
meanwhile
a
poor
woman
had
approached
the
leper
who
seemed
to
be
praying
her
long
hair
was
loose
and
unkempt
and
in
the
light
of
the
torches
could
be
recognized
the
extremely
emaciated
features
of
the
crazy
sisa
feeling
the
touch
of
her
hand
the
leper
jumped
up
with
a
cry
but
to
the
horror
of
the
onlooker
sisa
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
said
let
us
pray
let
us
pray
today
is
all
souls
day
those
lights
are
the
souls
of
men
let
us
pray
for
my
sons
separate
them
separate
them
the
madwoman
will
get
the
disease
cried
the
crowd
but
no
one
dared
to
go
near
them
do
you
see
that
light
in
the
tower
that
is
my
son
basilio
sliding
down
a
rope
do
you
see
that
light
in
the
convento
that
is
my
son
crispin
but
i
not
going
to
see
them
because
the
curate
is
sick
and
had
many
gold
pieces
and
the
gold
pieces
are
lost
pray
let
us
pray
for
the
soul
of
the
curate
i
took
him
the
finest
fruits
for
my
garden
was
full
of
flowers
and
i
had
two
sons
i
had
a
garden
i
used
to
take
care
of
my
flowers
and
i
had
two
sons
then
releasing
her
hold
of
the
leper
she
ran
away
singing
i
had
a
garden
and
flowers
i
had
two
sons
a
garden
and
flowers
what
have
you
been
able
to
do
for
that
poor
woman
maria
clara
asked
ibarra
nothing
lately
she
has
been
missing
from
the
totem
and
was
to
be
found
answered
the
youth
rather
confusedly
besides
i
have
been
very
busy
but
do
let
it
trouble
you
the
curate
has
promised
to
help
me
but
advised
that
i
proceed
with
great
tact
and
caution
for
the
civil
guard
seems
to
be
mixed
up
in
it
the
curate
is
greatly
interested
in
her
case
did
the
alferez
say
that
he
would
have
search
made
for
her
sons
yes
but
at
the
time
he
was
somewhat
drunk
scarcely
had
he
said
this
when
they
saw
the
crazy
woman
being
led
or
rather
dragged
along
by
a
soldier
sisa
was
offering
resistance
why
are
you
arresting
her
what
has
she
done
asked
ibarra
why
have
you
seen
how
she
been
raising
a
disturbance
was
the
reply
of
the
guardian
of
the
public
peace
the
leper
caught
up
his
basket
hurriedly
and
ran
away
maria
clara
wanted
to
go
home
as
she
had
lost
all
her
mirth
and
good
humor
so
there
are
people
who
are
not
happy
she
murmured
arriving
at
her
door
she
felt
her
sadness
increase
when
her
fiancé
declined
to
go
in
excusing
himself
on
the
plea
of
necessity
maria
clara
went
upstairs
thinking
what
a
bore
are
the
fiesta
days
when
strangers
make
their
visits

feria
como
le
va
en
ella
as
nothing
of
importance
to
our
characters
happened
during
the
first
two
days
we
should
gladly
pass
on
to
the
third
and
last
were
it
not
that
perhaps
some
foreign
reader
may
wish
to
know
how
the
filipinos
celebrate
their
fiestas
for
this
reason
we
shall
faithfully
reproduce
in
this
chapter
several
letters
one
of
them
being
that
of
the
correspondent
of
a
noted
manila
newspaper
respected
for
its
grave
tone
and
deep
seriousness
our
readers
will
correct
some
natural
and
trifling
slips
of
the
pen
thus
the
worthy
correspondent
of
the
respectable
newspaper
wrote
to
the
editor
my
distinguished
friend
never
did
i
witness
nor
had
i
ever
expected
to
see
in
the
provinces
a
religious
fiesta
so
solemn
so
splendid
and
so
impressive
as
that
now
being
celebrated
in
this
town
by
the
most
reverend
and
virtuous
franciscan
fathers
great
crowds
are
in
attendance
i
have
here
had
the
pleasure
of
greeting
nearly
all
the
spaniards
who
reside
in
this
province
three
reverend
augustinian
fathers
from
the
province
of
batangas
and
two
reverend
dominican
fathers
one
of
the
latter
is
the
very
reverend
fray
hernando
sibyla
who
has
come
to
honor
this
town
with
his
presence
a
distinction
which
its
worthy
inhabitants
should
never
forget
i
have
also
seen
a
great
number
of
the
best
people
of
cavite
and
pampanga
many
wealthy
persons
from
manila
and
many
bands
of
music
among
these
the
very
artistic
one
of
pagsanhan
belonging
to
the
escribano
don
miguel
guevara
swarms
of
chinamen
and
indians
who
with
the
curiosity
of
the
former
and
the
piety
of
the
latter
awaited
anxiously
the
day
on
which
was
to
be
celebrated
the
spectacle
for
which
a
large
and
spacious
theater
had
been
erected
in
the
middle
of
the
plaza
at
nine
on
the
night
of
the
the
eve
of
the
fiesta
after
a
succulent
dinner
set
before
us
by
the
the
attention
of
all
the
spaniards
and
friars
in
the
convento
was
attracted
by
strains
of
music
from
a
surging
multitude
which
with
the
noise
of
bombs
and
rockets
preceded
by
the
leading
citizens
of
the
town
came
to
the
convento
to
escort
us
to
the
place
prepared
and
arranged
for
us
that
we
might
witness
the
spectacle
such
a
courteous
offer
we
had
to
accept
although
i
should
have
preferred
to
rest
in
the
arms
of
morpheus
and
repose
my
weary
limbs
which
were
aching
thanks
to
the
joltings
of
the
vehicle
furnished
us
by
the
gobernadorcillo
of
b
accordingly
we
joined
them
and
proceeded
to
look
for
our
companions
who
were
dining
in
the
house
owned
here
by
the
pious
and
wealthy
don
santiago
de
los
santos
the
curate
of
the
town
the
very
reverend
fray
bernardo
salvi
and
the
very
reverend
fray
damaso
verdolagas
who
is
now
by
the
special
favor
of
heaven
recovered
from
the
suffering
caused
him
by
an
impious
hand
in
company
with
the
very
reverend
fray
hernando
sibyla
and
the
virtuous
curate
of
tanawan
with
other
spaniards
were
guests
in
the
house
of
the
filipino
croesus
there
we
had
the
good
fortune
of
admiring
not
only
the
luxury
and
good
taste
of
the
host
which
are
not
usual
among
the
natives
but
also
the
beauty
of
the
charming
and
wealthy
heiress
who
showed
herself
to
be
a
polished
disciple
of
cecelia
by
playing
on
her
elegant
piano
with
a
mastery
that
recalled
galvez
to
me
the
best
german
and
italian
compositions
it
is
a
matter
of
regret
that
such
a
charming
young
lady
should
be
so
excessively
modest
as
to
hide
her
talents
from
a
society
which
has
only
admiration
for
her
nor
should
i
leave
unwritten
that
in
the
house
of
our
host
there
were
set
before
us
champagne
and
fine
liqueurs
with
the
profusion
and
splendor
that
characterize
the
capitalist
we
attended
the
spectacle
you
already
know
our
artists
ratia
carvajal
and
fernandez
whose
cleverness
was
comprehended
by
us
alone
since
the
uncultured
crowd
did
not
understand
a
jot
of
it
chananay
and
balbino
were
very
good
though
a
little
hoarse
the
latter
made
one
break
but
together
and
as
regards
earnest
effort
they
were
admirable
the
indians
were
greatly
pleased
with
the
tagalog
drama
especially
the
gobernadorcillo
who
rubbed
his
hands
and
informed
us
that
it
was
a
pity
that
they
had
not
made
the
princess
join
in
combat
with
the
giant
who
had
stolen
her
away
which
in
his
opinion
would
have
been
more
marvelous
especially
if
the
giant
had
been
represented
as
vulnerable
only
in
the
navel
like
a
certain
ferragus
of
whom
the
stories
of
the
paladins
tell
the
very
reverend
fray
damaso
in
his
customary
goodness
of
heart
concurred
in
this
opinion
and
added
that
in
such
case
the
princess
should
be
made
to
discover
the
giant
weak
spot
and
give
him
the
de
needless
to
tell
you
that
during
the
show
the
affability
of
the
filipino
rothschild
allowed
nothing
to
be
lacking
lemonade
wines
and
refreshments
of
all
kinds
circulated
profusely
among
us
a
matter
of
reasonable
and
special
note
was
the
absence
of
the
and
cultured
youth
don
juan
crisostomo
ibarra
who
as
you
know
will
tomorrow
preside
at
the
laying
of
the
for
the
great
edifice
which
he
is
so
philanthropically
erecting
this
worthy
descendant
of
the
pelayos
and
elcanos
for
i
have
learned
that
one
of
his
paternal
ancestors
was
from
our
heroic
and
noble
northern
provinces
perhaps
one
of
the
companions
of
magellan
or
legazpi
did
not
show
himself
during
the
entire
day
owing
to
a
slight
indisposition
his
name
runs
from
mouth
to
mouth
being
uttered
with
praises
that
can
only
reflect
glory
upon
spain
and
true
spaniards
like
ourselves
who
never
deny
our
blood
however
mixed
it
may
be
today
at
eleven
in
the
morning
we
attended
a
spectacle
today
as
is
generally
known
is
the
fiesta
of
the
virgin
of
peace
and
is
being
observed
by
the
brethren
of
the
holy
rosary
tomorrow
will
occur
the
fiesta
of
the
patron
san
diego
and
it
will
be
observed
principally
by
the
venerable
tertiary
order
between
these
two
societies
there
exists
a
pious
rivalry
in
serving
god
which
piety
has
reached
the
extreme
of
holy
quarrels
among
them
as
has
just
happened
in
the
dispute
over
the
preacher
of
acknowledged
fame
the
very
reverend
fray
damaso
who
tomorrow
will
occupy
the
pulpit
of
the
holy
ghost
with
a
sermon
which
according
to
general
expectation
will
be
a
literary
and
religious
event
so
we
were
we
attended
a
highly
edifying
and
moving
spectacle
six
pious
youths
three
to
recite
the
mass
and
three
for
acolytes
marched
out
of
the
sacristy
and
prostrated
themselves
before
the
altar
while
the
officiating
priest
the
very
reverend
fray
hernando
sibyla
chanted
the
the
signal
for
commencing
the
procession
around
the
church
with
the
magnificent
voice
and
religious
unction
that
all
recognize
and
that
make
him
so
worthy
of
general
admiration
when
the
was
concluded
the
gobernadorcillo
in
a
frock
coat
carrying
the
standard
and
followed
by
four
acolytes
with
headed
the
procession
behind
them
came
the
tall
silver
candelabra
the
municipal
corporation
the
precious
images
dressed
in
satin
and
gold
representing
dominic
and
the
virgin
of
peace
in
a
magnificent
blue
robe
trimmed
with
gilded
silver
the
gift
of
the
pious
the
and
don
santiago
de
los
santos
all
these
images
were
borne
on
silver
cars
behind
the
mother
of
god
came
the
spaniards
and
the
rest
of
the
clergy
while
the
officiating
priest
was
protected
by
a
canopy
carried
by
the
cabezas
de
barangay
and
the
procession
was
closed
by
a
squad
of
the
worthy
civil
guard
i
believe
it
unnecessary
to
state
that
a
multitude
of
indians
carrying
lighted
candles
with
great
devotion
formed
the
two
lines
of
the
procession
the
musicians
played
religious
marches
while
bombs
and
pinwheels
furnished
repeated
salutes
it
causes
admiration
to
see
the
modesty
and
the
fervor
which
these
ceremonies
inspire
in
the
hearts
of
the
true
believers
the
grand
pure
faith
professed
for
the
virgin
of
peace
the
solemnity
and
fervent
devotion
with
which
such
ceremonies
are
performed
by
those
of
us
who
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
born
under
the
sacrosanct
and
immaculate
banner
of
spain
the
procession
concluded
there
began
the
mass
rendered
by
the
orchestra
and
the
theatrical
artists
after
the
reading
of
the
gospel
the
very
reverend
fray
manuel
martin
an
augustinian
from
the
province
of
batangas
ascended
the
pulpit
and
kept
the
whole
audience
enraptured
and
hanging
on
his
words
especially
the
spaniards
during
the
exordium
in
castilian
as
he
spoke
with
vigor
and
in
such
flowing
and
periods
that
our
hearts
were
filled
with
fervor
and
enthusiasm
this
indeed
is
the
term
that
should
be
used
for
what
is
felt
or
what
we
feel
when
the
virgin
of
our
beloved
spain
is
considered
and
above
all
when
there
can
be
intercalated
in
the
text
if
the
subject
permits
the
ideas
of
a
prince
of
the
church
the
which
are
surely
those
of
all
spaniards
at
the
conclusion
of
the
services
all
of
us
went
up
into
the
convento
with
the
leading
citizens
of
the
town
and
other
persons
of
note
there
we
were
especially
honored
by
the
refinement
attention
and
prodigality
that
characterize
the
very
reverend
fray
salvi
there
being
set
before
us
cigars
and
an
abundant
lunch
which
the
had
prepared
under
the
convento
for
all
who
might
feel
the
necessity
for
appeasing
the
cravings
of
their
stomachs
during
the
day
nothing
has
been
lacking
to
make
the
fiesta
joyous
and
to
preserve
the
animation
so
characteristic
of
spaniards
and
which
it
is
impossible
to
restrain
on
such
occasions
as
this
showing
itself
sometimes
in
singing
and
dancing
at
other
times
in
simple
and
merry
diversions
of
so
strong
and
noble
a
nature
that
all
sorrow
is
driven
away
and
it
is
enough
for
three
spaniards
to
be
gathered
together
in
one
place
in
order
that
sadness
and
be
banished
thence
then
homage
was
paid
to
terpsichore
in
many
homes
but
especially
in
that
of
the
cultured
filipino
millionaire
where
we
were
all
invited
to
dine
needless
to
say
the
banquet
which
was
sumptuous
and
elegantly
served
was
a
second
edition
of
the
in
cana
or
of
camacho
corrected
and
enlarged
while
we
were
enjoying
the
meal
which
was
directed
by
a
cook
from
campana
an
orchestra
played
harmonious
melodies
the
beautiful
young
lady
of
the
house
in
a
mestiza
gown
and
a
cascade
of
diamonds
was
as
ever
the
queen
of
the
all
of
us
deplored
from
the
bottom
of
our
hearts
a
light
sprain
in
her
shapely
foot
that
deprived
her
of
the
pleasures
of
the
dance
for
if
we
have
to
judge
by
her
other
conspicuous
perfections
the
young
lady
must
dance
like
a
sylph
the
alcalde
of
the
province
arrived
this
afternoon
for
the
purpose
of
honoring
with
his
presence
the
ceremony
of
tomorrow
he
has
expressed
regret
over
the
poor
health
of
the
distinguished
landlord
señor
ibarra
who
in
god
mercy
is
now
according
to
report
somewhat
recovered
tonight
there
was
a
solemn
procession
but
of
that
i
will
speak
in
my
letter
tomorrow
because
in
addition
to
the
explosions
that
have
bewildered
me
and
made
me
somewhat
deaf
i
am
tired
and
falling
over
with
sleep
while
therefore
i
recover
my
strength
in
the
arms
of
morpheus
or
rather
on
a
cot
in
the
convento
i
desire
for
you
my
distinguished
friend
a
pleasant
night
and
take
leave
of
you
until
tomorrow
which
will
be
the
great
day
your
affectionate
friend
san
diego
november
the
correspondent
thus
wrote
the
worthy
correspondent
now
let
us
see
what
capitan
martin
wrote
to
his
friend
luis
chiquito
dear
choy
come
if
you
can
for
there
something
doing
at
the
fiesta
just
imagine
capitan
joaquin
is
almost
broke
capitan
tiago
has
doubled
up
on
him
three
times
and
won
at
the
first
turn
of
the
cards
each
time
so
that
capitan
manuel
the
owner
of
the
house
is
growing
smaller
every
minute
from
sheer
joy
padre
damaso
smashed
a
lamp
with
his
fist
because
up
to
now
he
has
won
on
a
single
card
the
consul
has
lost
on
his
cocks
and
in
the
bank
all
that
he
won
from
us
at
the
fiesta
of
biñan
and
at
that
of
the
virgin
of
the
pillar
in
santa
cruz
we
expected
capitan
tiago
to
bring
us
his
future
the
rich
heir
of
don
rafael
but
it
seems
that
he
wishes
to
imitate
his
father
for
he
does
not
even
show
himself
a
pity
for
it
seems
he
never
will
be
any
use
to
us
carlos
the
chinaman
is
making
a
big
fortune
with
the
i
suspect
that
he
carries
something
hidden
probably
a
charm
for
he
complains
constantly
of
headaches
and
keeps
his
head
bandaged
and
when
the
wheel
of
the
is
slowing
down
he
leans
over
almost
touching
it
as
if
he
were
looking
at
it
closely
i
am
shocked
because
i
know
more
stories
of
the
same
kind
choy
my
birds
are
well
and
my
wife
is
happy
and
having
a
good
time
your
friend
martin
aristorenas
ibarra
had
received
a
perfumed
note
which
andeng
maria
delivered
to
him
on
the
evening
of
the
first
day
of
the
fiesta
this
note
said
crisostomo
it
has
been
over
a
day
since
you
have
shown
yourself
i
have
heard
that
you
are
ill
and
have
prayed
for
you
and
lighted
two
candles
although
papa
says
that
you
are
not
seriously
last
night
and
today
i
been
bored
by
requests
to
play
on
the
piano
and
by
invitations
to
dance
i
did
know
before
that
there
are
so
many
tiresome
people
in
the
world
if
it
were
not
for
padre
damaso
who
tries
to
entertain
me
by
talking
to
me
and
telling
me
many
things
i
would
have
shut
myself
up
in
my
room
and
gone
to
sleep
write
me
what
the
matter
is
with
you
and
i
tell
papa
to
visit
you
for
the
present
i
send
andeng
to
make
you
some
tea
as
she
knows
how
to
prepare
it
well
probably
better
than
your
servants
do
maria
clara
if
you
do
come
tomorrow
i
wo
go
to
the
ceremony
chapter
xxix
the
morning
at
the
first
flush
of
dawn
bands
of
music
awoke
the
tired
people
of
the
town
with
lively
airs
life
and
movement
reawakened
the
bells
began
to
chime
and
the
explosions
commenced
it
was
the
last
day
of
the
fiesta
in
fact
the
fiesta
proper
much
was
hoped
for
even
more
than
on
the
previous
day
the
brethren
of
the
venerable
tertiary
order
were
more
numerous
than
those
of
the
holy
rosary
so
they
smiled
piously
secure
that
they
would
humiliate
their
rivals
they
had
purchased
a
greater
number
of
tapers
wherefor
the
chinese
dealers
had
reaped
a
harvest
and
in
gratitude
were
thinking
of
being
baptized
although
some
remarked
that
this
was
not
so
much
on
account
of
their
faith
in
catholicism
as
from
a
desire
to
get
a
wife
to
this
the
pious
women
answered
even
so
the
marriage
of
so
many
chinamen
at
once
would
be
little
short
of
a
miracle
and
their
wives
would
convert
them
the
people
arrayed
themselves
in
their
best
clothes
and
dragged
out
from
their
all
their
jewelry
the
sharpers
and
gamblers
all
shone
in
embroidered
camisas
with
large
diamond
studs
heavy
gold
chains
and
white
straw
hats
only
the
old
sage
went
his
way
as
usual
in
his
sinamay
camisa
buttoned
up
to
the
neck
loose
shoes
and
wide
gray
felt
hat
you
look
sadder
than
ever
the
accosted
him
you
want
us
to
be
happy
now
and
then
since
we
have
so
much
to
weep
over
to
be
happy
does
mean
to
act
the
fool
answered
the
old
man
the
senseless
orgy
of
every
year
and
all
for
no
end
but
to
squander
money
when
there
is
so
much
misery
and
want
yes
i
understand
it
all
it
the
same
orgy
the
revel
to
drown
the
woes
of
all
you
know
that
i
share
your
opinion
though
replied
don
filipo
half
jestingly
and
half
in
earnest
i
have
defended
it
but
what
can
one
do
against
the
gobernadorcillo
and
the
curate
resign
was
the
old
man
curt
answer
as
he
moved
away
don
filipo
stood
perplexed
staring
after
the
old
man
resign
he
muttered
as
he
made
his
way
toward
the
church
resign
yes
if
this
office
were
an
honor
and
not
a
burden
yes
i
would
resign
the
paved
court
in
front
of
the
church
was
filled
with
people
men
and
women
young
and
old
dressed
in
their
best
clothes
all
crowded
together
came
and
went
through
the
wide
doors
there
was
a
smell
of
powder
of
flowers
of
incense
and
of
perfumes
while
bombs
rockets
and
made
the
women
run
and
scream
the
children
laugh
one
band
played
in
front
of
the
convento
another
escorted
the
town
officials
and
still
others
marched
about
the
streets
where
floated
and
waved
a
multitude
of
banners
variegated
colors
and
lights
distracted
the
sight
melodies
and
explosions
the
hearing
while
the
bells
kept
up
a
ceaseless
chime
moving
all
about
were
carriages
whose
horses
at
times
became
frightened
frisked
and
reared
all
of
which
while
not
included
in
the
program
of
the
fiesta
formed
a
show
in
itself
free
and
by
no
means
the
least
entertaining
the
for
this
day
had
sent
servants
to
seek
in
the
streets
for
whomsoever
they
might
invite
as
did
he
who
gave
the
feast
of
which
the
gospel
tells
us
almost
by
force
were
urged
invitations
to
partake
of
chocolate
coffee
tea
and
sweetmeats
these
invitations
not
seldom
reaching
the
proportions
of
a
demand
there
was
to
be
celebrated
the
high
mass
that
known
as
the
dalmatic
like
the
one
of
the
day
before
about
which
the
worthy
correspondent
wrote
only
that
now
the
officiating
priest
was
to
be
padre
salvi
and
that
the
alcalde
of
the
province
with
many
other
spaniards
and
persons
of
note
was
to
attend
it
in
order
to
hear
padre
damaso
who
enjoyed
a
great
reputation
in
the
province
even
the
alferez
smarting
under
the
preachments
of
padre
salvi
would
also
attend
in
order
to
give
evidence
of
his
and
to
recompense
himself
if
possible
for
the
bad
spells
the
curate
had
caused
him
such
was
the
reputation
of
padre
damaso
that
the
correspondent
wrote
beforehand
to
the
editor
of
his
newspaper
as
was
announced
in
my
badly
executed
account
of
yesterday
so
it
has
come
to
pass
we
have
had
the
especial
pleasure
of
listening
to
the
very
reverend
fray
damaso
verdolagas
former
curate
of
this
town
recently
transferred
to
a
larger
parish
in
recognition
of
his
meritorious
services
the
illustrious
and
holy
orator
occupied
the
pulpit
of
the
holy
ghost
and
preached
a
most
eloquent
and
profound
sermon
which
edified
and
left
marveling
all
the
faithful
who
had
waited
so
anxiously
to
see
spring
from
his
fecund
lips
the
restoring
fountain
of
eternal
life
sublimity
of
conception
boldness
of
imagination
novelty
of
phraseology
gracefulness
of
style
naturalness
of
gestures
cleverness
of
speech
vigor
of
ideas
these
are
the
traits
of
the
spanish
bossuet
who
has
justly
earned
such
a
high
reputation
not
only
among
the
enlightened
spaniards
but
even
among
the
rude
indians
and
the
cunning
sons
of
the
celestial
empire
but
the
confiding
correspondent
almost
saw
himself
obliged
to
erase
what
he
had
written
padre
damaso
complained
of
a
cold
that
he
had
contracted
the
night
before
for
after
singing
a
few
merry
songs
he
had
eaten
three
plates
of
and
attended
the
show
for
a
short
time
as
a
result
of
all
this
he
wished
to
renounce
his
part
as
the
spokesman
of
god
to
men
but
as
no
one
else
was
to
be
found
who
was
so
well
versed
in
the
life
and
miracles
of
san
diego
the
curate
knew
them
it
is
true
but
it
was
his
place
to
celebrate
mass
the
other
priests
unanimously
declared
that
the
tone
of
padre
damaso
voice
could
not
be
improved
upon
and
that
it
would
be
a
great
pity
for
him
to
forego
delivering
such
an
eloquent
sermon
as
he
had
written
and
memorized
accordingly
his
former
housekeeper
prepared
for
him
lemonade
rubbed
his
chest
and
neck
with
liniment
and
massaged
him
and
wrapped
him
in
warm
cloths
he
drank
some
raw
eggs
beaten
up
in
wine
and
for
the
whole
morning
neither
talked
nor
breakfasted
taking
only
a
glass
of
milk
and
a
cup
of
chocolate
with
a
dozen
or
so
of
crackers
heroically
renouncing
his
usual
fried
chicken
and
half
of
a
laguna
cheese
because
the
housekeeper
affirmed
that
cheese
contained
salt
and
grease
which
would
aggravate
his
cough
all
for
the
sake
of
meriting
heaven
and
of
converting
us
exclaimed
the
tertiary
sisters
much
affected
upon
being
informed
of
these
sacrifices
may
our
lady
of
peace
punish
him
muttered
the
sisters
of
the
holy
rosary
unable
to
forgive
him
for
leaning
to
the
side
of
their
rivals
at
half
past
eight
the
procession
started
from
the
shadow
of
the
canvas
canopy
it
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
previous
day
but
for
the
introduction
of
one
novelty
the
older
members
of
the
venerable
tertiary
order
and
some
maidens
dressed
as
old
women
displayed
long
gowns
the
poor
having
them
of
coarse
cloth
and
the
rich
of
silk
or
rather
of
franciscan
as
it
is
called
since
it
is
most
used
by
the
reverend
franciscan
friars
all
these
sacred
garments
were
genuine
having
come
from
the
convento
in
manila
where
the
people
may
obtain
them
as
alms
at
a
fixed
price
if
a
commercial
term
may
be
permitted
this
fixed
price
was
liable
to
increase
but
not
to
reduction
in
the
convento
itself
and
in
the
nunnery
of
clara
are
sold
these
same
garments
which
possess
besides
the
special
merit
of
gaining
many
indulgences
for
those
who
may
be
shrouded
in
them
the
very
special
merit
of
being
dearer
in
proportion
as
they
are
old
threadbare
and
unserviceable
we
write
this
in
case
any
pious
reader
need
such
sacred
relics
or
any
cunning
of
europe
wish
to
make
a
fortune
by
taking
to
the
philippines
a
consignment
of
patched
and
grimy
garments
since
they
are
valued
at
sixteen
pesos
or
more
according
to
their
more
or
less
tattered
appearance
san
diego
de
alcala
was
borne
on
a
float
adorned
with
plates
of
repoussé
silver
the
saint
though
rather
thin
had
an
ivory
bust
which
gave
him
a
severe
and
majestic
mien
in
spite
of
abundant
kingly
bangs
like
those
of
the
negrito
his
mantle
was
of
satin
embroidered
with
gold
our
venerable
father
francis
followed
the
virgin
as
on
yesterday
except
that
the
priest
under
the
canopy
this
time
was
padre
salvi
and
not
the
graceful
padre
sibyla
so
refined
in
manner
but
if
the
former
lacked
a
beautiful
carriage
he
had
more
than
enough
unction
walking
half
bent
over
with
lowered
eyes
and
hands
crossed
in
mystic
attitude
the
bearers
of
the
canopy
were
the
same
cabezas
de
barangay
sweating
with
satisfaction
at
seeing
themselves
at
the
same
time
collectors
of
the
tribute
redeemers
of
poor
erring
humanity
and
consequently
christs
who
were
giving
their
blood
for
the
sins
of
others
the
surpliced
coadjutor
went
from
float
to
float
carrying
the
censer
with
the
smoke
from
which
he
from
time
to
time
regaled
the
nostrils
of
the
curate
who
then
became
even
more
serious
and
grave
so
the
procession
moved
forward
slowly
and
deliberately
to
the
sound
of
bombs
songs
and
religious
melodies
let
loose
into
the
air
by
bands
of
musicians
that
followed
the
floats
meanwhile
the
distributed
candles
with
such
zeal
that
many
of
the
participants
returned
to
their
homes
with
light
enough
for
four
nights
of
devoutly
the
curious
spectators
knelt
at
the
passage
of
the
float
of
the
mother
of
god
reciting
credos
and
salves
fervently
in
front
of
a
house
in
whose
gaily
decorated
windows
were
to
be
seen
the
alcalde
capitan
tiago
maria
clara
and
ibarra
with
various
spaniards
and
young
ladies
the
float
was
detained
padre
salvi
happened
to
raise
his
eyes
but
made
not
the
slightest
movement
that
might
have
been
taken
for
a
salute
or
a
recognition
of
them
he
merely
stood
erect
so
that
his
cope
fell
over
his
shoulders
more
gracefully
and
elegantly
in
the
street
under
the
window
was
a
young
woman
of
pleasing
countenance
dressed
in
deep
mourning
carrying
in
her
arms
a
young
baby
she
must
have
been
a
nursemaid
only
for
the
child
was
white
and
ruddy
while
she
was
brown
and
had
hair
blacker
than
jet
upon
seeing
the
curate
the
tender
infant
held
out
its
arms
laughed
with
the
laugh
that
neither
causes
nor
is
caused
by
sorrow
and
cried
out
stammeringly
in
the
midst
of
a
brief
silence
papa
papa
the
young
woman
shuddered
slapped
her
hand
hurriedly
over
the
mouth
and
ran
away
in
dismay
with
the
baby
crying
malicious
ones
winked
at
each
other
and
the
spaniards
who
had
witnessed
the
short
scene
smiled
while
the
natural
pallor
of
padre
salvi
changed
to
the
hue
of
poppies
yet
the
people
were
wrong
for
the
curate
was
not
acquainted
with
the
woman
at
all
she
being
a
stranger
in
the
town
chapter
xxx
in
the
church
from
end
to
end
the
huge
barn
that
men
dedicate
as
a
home
to
the
creator
of
all
existing
things
was
filled
with
people
pushing
crowding
and
crushing
one
another
the
few
who
were
leaving
and
the
many
who
were
entering
filled
the
air
with
exclamations
of
distress
even
from
afar
an
arm
would
be
stretched
out
to
dip
the
fingers
in
the
holy
water
but
at
the
critical
moment
the
surging
crowd
would
force
the
hand
away
then
would
be
heard
a
complaint
a
trampled
woman
would
upbraid
some
one
but
the
pushing
would
continue
some
old
people
might
succeed
in
dipping
their
fingers
in
the
water
now
the
color
of
slime
where
the
population
of
a
whole
town
with
transients
besides
had
washed
with
it
they
would
anoint
themselves
devoutly
although
with
difficulty
on
the
neck
on
the
crown
of
the
head
on
the
forehead
on
the
chin
on
the
chest
and
on
the
abdomen
in
the
assurance
that
thus
they
were
sanctifying
those
parts
and
that
they
would
suffer
neither
stiff
neck
headache
consumption
nor
indigestion
the
young
people
whether
they
were
not
so
ailing
or
did
not
believe
in
that
holy
prophylactic
hardly
more
than
moistened
the
tip
of
a
finger
and
this
only
in
order
that
the
devout
might
have
no
cause
to
talk
and
pretended
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
their
foreheads
of
course
without
touching
them
it
may
be
blessed
and
everything
you
may
wish
some
young
woman
doubtless
thought
but
it
has
such
a
color
it
was
difficult
to
breathe
in
the
heat
amid
the
smells
of
the
human
animal
but
the
preacher
was
worth
all
these
inconveniences
as
the
sermon
was
costing
the
town
two
hundred
and
fifty
pesos
old
tasio
had
said
two
hundred
and
fifty
pesos
for
a
sermon
one
man
on
one
occasion
only
a
third
of
what
comedians
cost
who
will
work
for
three
nights
surely
you
must
be
very
rich
what
has
that
to
do
with
the
drama
testily
inquired
the
nervous
leader
of
the
tertiary
brethren
with
the
drama
souls
go
to
hell
but
with
the
sermon
to
heaven
if
he
had
asked
a
thousand
we
would
have
paid
him
and
should
still
owe
him
gratitude
after
all
you
right
replied
the
sage
for
the
sermon
is
more
amusing
to
me
at
least
than
the
drama
but
i
am
not
amused
even
by
the
drama
yelled
the
other
furiously
i
believe
it
since
you
understand
one
about
as
well
as
you
do
the
other
and
the
impious
old
man
moved
away
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
insults
and
the
direful
prophecies
that
the
irritated
leader
offered
concerning
his
future
existence
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
alcalde
the
people
sweated
and
yawned
agitating
the
air
with
fans
hats
and
handkerchiefs
children
shouted
and
cried
which
kept
the
sacristans
busy
putting
them
out
of
the
sacred
edifice
such
action
brought
to
the
dull
and
conscientious
leader
of
the
brotherhood
of
the
holy
rosary
this
thought
little
children
to
come
unto
me
said
our
savior
it
is
true
but
here
must
be
understood
children
who
do
not
cry
an
old
woman
in
a
habit
sister
puté
chid
her
granddaughter
a
child
of
six
years
who
was
kneeling
at
her
side
o
lost
one
give
heed
for
you
going
to
hear
a
sermon
like
that
of
good
friday
here
the
old
lady
gave
her
a
pinch
to
awaken
the
piety
of
the
child
who
made
a
grimace
stuck
out
her
nose
and
wrinkled
up
her
eyebrows
some
men
squatted
on
their
heels
and
dozed
beside
the
confessional
one
old
man
nodding
caused
our
old
woman
to
believe
that
he
was
mumbling
prayers
so
running
her
fingers
rapidly
over
the
beads
of
her
rosary
as
that
was
the
most
reverent
way
of
respecting
the
designs
of
heaven
little
by
little
she
set
herself
to
imitating
hint
ibarra
stood
in
one
corner
while
maria
clara
knelt
near
the
high
altar
in
a
space
which
the
curate
had
had
the
courtesy
to
order
the
sacristans
to
clear
for
her
capitan
tiago
in
a
frock
coat
sat
on
one
of
the
benches
provided
for
the
authorities
which
caused
the
children
who
did
not
know
him
to
take
him
for
another
gobernadorcillo
and
to
be
wary
about
getting
near
him
at
last
the
alcalde
with
his
staff
arrived
proceeding
from
the
sacristy
and
taking
their
seats
in
magnificent
chairs
placed
on
strips
of
carpet
the
alcalde
wore
a
uniform
and
displayed
the
cordon
of
carlos
iii
with
four
or
five
other
decorations
the
people
did
not
recognize
him
exclaimed
a
rustic
a
dressed
as
a
comedian
fool
rejoined
a
bystander
nudging
him
with
his
elbow
it
the
prince
villardo
that
we
saw
at
the
show
last
night
so
the
alcalde
went
up
several
degrees
in
the
popular
estimation
by
becoming
an
enchanted
prince
a
vanquisher
of
giants
when
the
mass
began
those
who
were
seated
arose
and
those
who
had
been
asleep
were
awakened
by
the
ringing
of
the
bells
and
the
sonorous
voices
of
the
singers
padre
salvi
in
spite
of
his
gravity
wore
a
look
of
deep
satisfaction
since
there
were
serving
him
as
deacon
and
subdeacon
none
less
than
two
augustinians
each
one
as
it
came
his
turn
sang
well
in
a
more
or
less
nasal
tone
and
with
unintelligible
articulation
except
the
officiating
priest
himself
whose
voice
trembled
somewhat
even
getting
out
of
tune
at
times
to
the
great
wonder
of
those
who
knew
him
still
he
moved
about
with
precision
and
elegance
while
he
recited
the
unctuously
dropping
his
head
a
little
to
the
side
and
gazing
toward
heaven
seeing
him
receive
the
smoke
from
the
incense
one
would
have
said
that
galen
was
right
in
averring
the
passage
of
smoke
in
the
nasal
canals
to
the
head
through
a
screen
of
ethmoids
since
he
straightened
himself
threw
his
head
back
and
moved
toward
the
middle
of
the
altar
with
such
pompousness
and
gravity
that
capitan
tiago
found
him
more
majestic
than
the
chinese
comedian
of
the
night
before
even
though
the
latter
had
been
dressed
as
an
emperor
with
beribboned
sword
stiff
beard
like
a
mane
and
slippers
undoubtedly
so
his
thoughts
ran
a
single
curate
of
ours
has
more
majesty
than
all
the
emperors
at
length
came
the
expected
moment
that
of
hearing
padre
damaso
the
three
priests
seated
themselves
in
their
chairs
in
an
edifying
attitude
as
the
worthy
correspondent
would
say
the
alcalde
and
other
persons
of
place
and
position
following
their
example
the
music
ceased
the
sudden
transition
from
noise
to
silence
awoke
our
aged
sister
puté
who
was
already
snoring
under
cover
of
the
music
like
segismundo
or
like
the
cook
in
the
story
of
the
sleeping
beauty
the
first
thing
that
she
did
upon
awaking
was
to
whack
her
granddaughter
on
the
neck
as
the
child
had
also
fallen
asleep
the
latter
screamed
but
soon
consoled
herself
at
the
sight
of
a
woman
who
was
beating
her
breast
with
contrition
and
enthusiasm
all
tried
to
place
themselves
comfortably
those
who
had
no
benches
squatting
down
on
the
floor
or
on
their
heels
padre
damaso
passed
through
the
congregation
preceded
by
two
sacristans
and
followed
by
another
friar
carrying
a
massive
volume
he
disappeared
as
he
went
up
the
winding
staircase
but
his
round
head
soon
reappeared
then
his
fat
neck
followed
immediately
by
his
body
coughing
slightly
he
looked
about
him
with
assurance
he
noticed
ibarra
and
with
a
special
wink
gave
to
understand
that
he
would
not
overlook
that
youth
in
his
prayers
then
he
turned
a
look
of
satisfaction
upon
padre
sibyla
and
another
of
disdain
upon
padre
martin
the
preacher
of
the
previous
day
this
inspection
concluded
he
turned
cautiously
and
said
attention
brother
to
his
companion
who
opened
the
massive
volume
but
the
sermon
deserves
a
separate
chapter
a
young
man
who
was
then
learning
stenography
and
who
idolizes
great
orators
took
it
down
thanks
to
this
fact
we
can
here
present
a
selection
from
the
sacred
oratory
of
those
regions
chapter
xxxi
the
sermon
fray
damaso
began
slowly
in
a
low
voice
spiritum
bonum
dedisti
qui
doceret
eos
et
manna
tuum
non
prohibuisti
ab
ore
eorum
et
aquam
dedisti
eis
in
and
thou
gavest
thy
good
spirit
to
teach
them
and
thy
manna
thou
didst
not
withhold
from
their
mouth
and
thou
gavest
them
water
for
their
thirst
words
which
the
lord
spoke
through
the
mouth
of
esdras
in
the
second
book
the
ninth
chapter
and
the
twentieth
verse
padre
sibyla
glanced
in
surprise
at
the
preacher
padre
manuel
martin
turned
pale
and
swallowed
hard
that
was
better
than
his
whether
padre
damaso
noticed
this
or
whether
he
was
still
hoarse
the
fact
is
that
he
coughed
several
times
as
he
placed
both
hands
on
the
rail
of
the
pulpit
the
holy
ghost
was
above
his
head
freshly
painted
clean
and
white
with
beak
and
feet
most
honorable
sir
to
the
alcalde
most
holy
priests
christians
brethren
in
jesus
christ
here
he
made
a
solemn
pause
as
again
he
swept
his
gaze
over
the
congregation
with
whose
attention
and
concentration
he
seemed
satisfied
the
first
part
of
the
sermon
is
to
be
in
spanish
and
the
other
in
tagalog
omnes
after
the
salutations
and
the
pause
he
extended
his
right
hand
majestically
toward
the
altar
at
the
same
time
fixing
his
gaze
on
the
alcalde
he
slowly
crossed
his
arms
without
uttering
a
word
then
suddenly
passing
from
calmness
to
action
threw
back
his
head
and
made
a
sign
toward
the
main
door
sawing
the
air
with
his
open
hand
so
forcibly
that
the
sacristans
interpreted
the
gesture
as
a
command
and
closed
the
doors
the
alferez
became
uneasy
doubting
whether
he
should
go
or
stay
when
the
preacher
began
in
a
strong
voice
full
and
sonorous
truly
his
old
housekeeper
was
skilled
in
medicine
radiant
and
resplendent
is
the
altar
wide
is
the
great
door
the
air
is
the
vehicle
of
the
holy
and
divine
words
that
will
spring
from
my
mouth
hear
ye
then
with
the
ears
of
your
souls
and
hearts
that
the
words
of
the
lord
may
not
fall
on
the
stony
soil
where
the
birds
of
hell
may
consume
them
but
that
ye
may
grow
and
flourish
as
holy
seed
in
the
field
of
our
venerable
and
seraphic
father
francis
o
ye
great
sinners
captives
of
the
moros
of
the
soul
that
infest
the
sea
of
eternal
life
in
the
powerful
craft
of
the
flesh
and
the
world
ye
who
are
laden
with
the
fetters
of
lust
and
avarice
and
who
toil
in
the
galleys
of
the
infernal
satan
look
ye
here
with
reverent
repentance
upon
him
who
saved
souls
from
the
captivity
of
the
devil
upon
the
intrepid
gideon
upon
the
valiant
david
upon
the
triumphant
roland
of
christianity
upon
the
celestial
civil
guard
more
powerful
than
all
the
civil
guards
together
now
existing
or
to
exist
the
alferez
frowned
yes
señor
alferez
more
valiant
and
powerful
he
who
with
no
other
weapon
than
a
wooden
cross
boldly
vanquishes
the
eternal
tulisan
of
the
shades
and
all
the
hosts
of
lucifer
and
who
would
have
exterminated
them
forever
were
not
the
spirits
immortal
this
marvel
of
divine
creation
this
wonderful
prodigy
is
the
blessed
diego
of
alcala
who
if
i
may
avail
myself
of
a
comparison
since
comparisons
aid
in
the
comprehension
of
incomprehensible
things
as
another
has
said
i
say
then
that
this
great
saint
is
merely
a
private
soldier
a
steward
in
the
powerful
company
which
our
seraphic
father
francis
sends
from
heaven
and
to
which
i
have
the
honor
to
belong
as
a
corporal
or
sergeant
by
the
grace
of
god
the
rude
indians
as
the
correspondent
would
say
caught
nothing
more
from
this
paragraph
than
the
words
civil
guard
tulisan
san
diego
and
francis
so
observing
the
wry
face
of
the
alferez
and
the
bellicose
gestures
of
the
preacher
they
deduced
that
the
latter
was
reprehending
him
for
not
running
down
the
tulisanes
san
diego
and
francis
would
be
commissioned
in
this
duty
and
justly
so
as
is
proved
by
a
picture
existing
in
the
convento
at
manila
representing
francis
by
means
of
his
girdle
only
holding
back
the
chinese
invasion
in
the
first
years
after
the
discovery
the
devout
were
accordingly
not
a
little
rejoiced
and
thanked
god
for
this
aid
not
doubting
that
once
the
tulisanes
had
disappeared
francis
would
also
destroy
the
civil
guard
with
redoubled
attention
therefore
they
listened
to
padre
damaso
as
he
continued
most
honorable
sir
great
affairs
are
great
affairs
even
by
the
side
of
the
small
and
the
small
are
always
small
even
by
the
side
of
the
great
so
history
says
but
since
history
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
only
once
in
a
hundred
times
being
a
thing
made
by
men
and
men
make
mistakes
es
as
cicero
said
he
who
opens
his
mouth
makes
mistakes
as
they
say
in
my
country
then
the
result
is
that
there
are
profound
truths
which
history
does
not
record
these
truths
most
honorable
sir
the
divine
spirit
spoke
with
that
supreme
wisdom
which
human
intelligence
has
not
comprehended
since
the
times
of
seneca
and
aristotle
those
wise
priests
of
antiquity
even
to
our
sinful
days
and
these
truths
are
that
not
always
are
small
affairs
small
but
that
they
are
great
not
by
the
side
of
the
little
things
but
by
the
side
of
the
grandest
of
the
earth
and
of
the
heavens
and
of
the
air
and
of
the
clouds
and
of
the
waters
and
of
space
and
of
life
and
of
death
amen
exclaimed
the
leader
of
the
tertiaries
crossing
himself
with
this
figure
of
rhetoric
which
he
had
learned
from
a
famous
preacher
in
manila
padre
damaso
wished
to
startle
his
audience
and
in
fact
his
holy
ghost
was
so
fascinated
with
such
great
truths
that
it
was
necessary
to
kick
him
to
remind
him
of
his
business
patent
to
your
eyes
prompted
the
holy
ghost
below
patent
to
your
eyes
is
the
conclusive
and
impressive
proof
of
this
eternal
philosophical
truth
patent
is
that
sun
of
virtue
and
i
say
sun
and
not
moon
for
there
is
no
great
merit
in
the
fact
that
the
moon
shines
during
the
night
in
the
land
of
the
blind
the
man
is
king
by
night
may
shine
a
light
a
tiny
star
so
the
greatest
merit
is
to
be
able
to
shine
even
in
the
middle
of
the
day
as
the
sun
does
so
shines
our
brother
diego
even
in
the
midst
of
the
greatest
saints
here
you
have
patent
to
your
eyes
in
your
impious
disbelief
the
masterpiece
of
the
highest
for
the
confusion
of
the
great
of
the
earth
yes
my
brethren
patent
to
all
patent
a
man
rose
pale
and
trembling
and
hid
himself
in
a
confessional
he
was
a
liquor
dealer
who
had
been
dozing
and
dreaming
that
the
carbineers
were
demanding
the
patent
or
license
that
he
did
not
have
it
may
safely
be
affirmed
that
he
did
not
come
out
from
his
while
the
sermon
lasted
humble
and
lowly
saint
thy
wooden
cross
the
one
that
the
image
held
was
of
silver
thy
modest
gown
honors
the
great
francis
whose
sons
and
imitators
we
are
we
propagate
thy
holy
race
in
the
whole
world
in
the
remote
places
in
the
cities
in
the
towns
without
distinction
between
black
and
white
the
alcalde
held
his
breath
suffering
hardships
and
martyrdoms
thy
holy
race
of
faith
and
religion
militant
ah
breathed
the
alcalde
which
holds
the
world
in
balance
and
prevents
it
from
falling
into
the
depths
of
perdition
his
hearers
including
even
capitan
tiago
yawned
little
by
little
maria
clara
was
not
listening
to
the
sermon
for
she
knew
that
ibarra
was
near
and
was
thinking
about
him
while
she
fanned
herself
and
gazed
at
an
evangelical
bull
that
had
all
the
outlines
of
a
small
carabao
all
should
know
by
heart
the
holy
scriptures
and
the
lives
of
the
saints
and
then
i
should
not
have
to
preach
to
you
o
sinners
you
should
know
such
important
and
necessary
things
as
the
prayer
although
many
of
you
have
forgotten
it
living
now
as
do
the
protestants
or
heretics
who
like
the
chinese
respect
not
the
ministers
of
god
but
the
worse
for
you
o
ye
accursed
moving
as
you
are
toward
damnation
pale
lamaso
what
muttered
carlos
the
chinese
looking
angrily
at
the
preacher
who
continued
to
extemporize
emitting
a
series
of
apostrophes
and
imprecations
you
will
die
in
final
unrepentance
o
race
of
heretics
god
punishes
you
even
on
this
earth
with
jails
and
prisons
women
should
flee
from
you
the
rulers
should
hang
all
of
you
so
that
the
seed
of
satan
be
not
multiplied
in
the
vineyard
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
said
you
have
an
evil
member
that
leads
you
to
sin
cut
it
off
and
cast
it
into
the
fire
having
forgotten
both
his
sermon
and
his
rhetoric
fray
damaso
began
to
be
nervous
ibarra
became
uneasy
and
looked
about
for
a
quiet
corner
but
the
church
was
crowded
maria
clara
neither
heard
nor
saw
anything
as
she
was
analyzing
a
picture
of
the
blessed
souls
in
purgatory
souls
in
the
shape
of
men
and
women
dressed
in
hides
with
miters
hoods
and
cowls
all
roasting
in
the
fire
and
clutching
girdle
which
did
not
break
even
with
such
great
weight
with
that
improvisation
on
the
preacher
part
the
friar
lost
the
thread
of
the
sermon
and
skipped
over
three
long
paragraphs
giving
the
wrong
cue
to
the
now
fray
damaso
who
of
you
o
sinners
would
lick
the
sores
of
a
poor
and
ragged
beggar
who
let
him
answer
by
raising
his
hand
none
that
i
knew
for
only
a
saint
like
diego
de
alcala
would
do
it
he
licked
all
the
sores
saying
to
an
astonished
brother
is
this
sick
one
cured
o
christian
charity
o
matchless
example
o
virtue
of
virtues
o
inimitable
pattern
o
spotless
talisman
here
he
continued
a
long
series
of
exclamations
the
while
crossing
his
arms
and
raising
and
lowering
them
as
though
he
wished
to
fly
or
to
frighten
the
birds
away
before
dying
he
spoke
in
latin
without
knowing
latin
marvel
o
sinners
you
in
spite
of
what
you
study
for
which
blows
are
given
to
you
you
do
not
speak
latin
and
you
will
die
without
speaking
it
to
speak
latin
is
a
gift
of
god
and
therefore
the
church
uses
latin
i
too
speak
latin
was
god
going
to
deny
this
consolation
to
his
beloved
diego
could
he
die
could
he
be
permitted
to
die
without
speaking
latin
impossible
god
would
be
just
he
be
god
so
he
talked
in
latin
and
of
that
fact
the
writers
of
his
time
bear
witness
he
ended
this
exordium
with
the
passage
which
had
cost
him
the
most
toil
and
which
he
had
plagiarized
from
a
great
writer
sinibaldo
de
mas
therefore
i
salute

thy

and
thy

higher
than

and
clearer
than

itself
that
circles
about
thy
feet
aid
me
all
of
you
as
you
appeal
to
god
for
sufficient
inspiration
by
reciting
the
ave
maria
all
fell
upon
their
knees
and
raised
a
murmur
like
the
humming
of
a
thousand
bees
the
alcalde
laboriously
bent
one
knee
and
wagged
his
head
in
a
disgusted
manner
while
the
alferez
looked
pale
and
penitent
to
the
devil
with
the
curate
muttered
one
of
two
youths
who
had
come
from
manila
keep
still
admonished
his
companion
his
woman
might
hear
us
meanwhile
padre
damaso
instead
of
reciting
the
ave
maria
was
scolding
his
holy
ghost
for
having
skipped
three
of
his
best
paragraphs
at
the
same
time
he
consumed
a
couple
of
cakes
and
a
glass
of
malaga
secure
of
encountering
therein
greater
inspiration
than
in
all
the
holy
ghosts
whether
of
wood
in
the
form
of
a
dove
or
of
flesh
in
the
shape
of
an
inattentive
friar
then
he
began
the
sermon
in
tagalog
the
devout
old
woman
again
gave
her
granddaughter
a
hearty
slap
the
child
awoke
and
asked
is
it
time
to
cry
now
not
yet
o
lost
one
but
do
go
to
sleep
again
answered
the
good
grandmother
of
the
second
part
of
the
sermon
that
in
tagalog
we
have
only
a
few
rough
notes
for
padre
damaso
extemporized
in
this
language
not
because
he
knew
it
better
but
because
holding
the
provincial
filipinos
ignorant
of
rhetoric
he
was
not
afraid
of
making
blunders
before
them
with
spaniards
the
case
was
different
he
had
heard
rules
of
oratory
spoken
of
and
it
was
possible
that
among
his
hearers
some
one
had
been
in
perhaps
the
alcalde
so
he
wrote
out
his
sermons
corrected
and
polished
them
and
then
memorized
and
rehearsed
them
for
several
days
beforehand
it
is
common
knowledge
that
none
of
those
present
understood
the
drift
of
the
sermon
they
were
so
dull
of
understanding
and
the
preacher
was
so
profound
as
sister
rufa
said
that
the
audience
waited
in
vain
for
an
opportunity
to
weep
and
the
lost
grandchild
of
the
blessed
old
woman
went
to
sleep
again
nevertheless
this
part
had
greater
consequences
than
the
first
at
least
for
certain
hearers
as
we
shall
see
later
he
began
with
a
capatir
con
followed
by
an
avalanche
of
untranslatable
phrases
he
talked
of
the
soul
of
hell
of
na
santo
of
the
indian
sinners
and
of
the
virtuous
franciscan
fathers
the
devil
exclaimed
one
of
the
two
irreverent
manilans
to
his
companion
that
all
greek
to
me
i
going
seeing
the
doors
closed
he
went
out
through
the
sacristy
to
the
great
scandal
of
the
people
and
especially
of
the
preacher
who
turned
pale
and
paused
in
the
midst
of
his
sentence
some
looked
for
a
violent
apostrophe
but
padre
damaso
contented
himself
with
watching
the
delinquent
and
then
he
went
on
with
his
sermon
then
were
let
loose
curses
upon
the
age
against
the
lack
of
reverence
against
the
growing
indifference
to
religion
this
matter
seemed
to
be
his
forte
for
he
appeared
to
be
inspired
and
expressed
himself
with
force
and
clearness
he
talked
of
the
sinners
who
did
not
attend
confession
who
died
in
prisons
without
the
sacraments
of
families
accursed
of
proud
and
little
of
young
sages
and
little
philosophers
of
pettifoggers
of
picayunish
students
and
so
on
well
known
is
this
habit
that
many
have
when
they
wish
to
ridicule
their
enemies
they
apply
to
them
belittling
epithets
because
their
brains
do
not
appear
to
furnish
them
any
other
means
and
thus
they
are
happy
ibarra
heard
it
all
and
understood
the
allusions
preserving
an
outward
calm
he
turned
his
eyes
to
god
and
the
authorities
but
saw
nothing
more
than
the
images
of
saints
and
the
alcalde
was
sleeping
meanwhile
the
preacher
enthusiasm
was
rising
by
degrees
he
spoke
of
the
times
when
every
filipino
upon
meeting
a
priest
took
off
his
hat
knelt
on
the
ground
and
kissed
the
priest
hand
but
now
he
added
you
only
take
off
your
salakot
or
your
felt
hat
which
you
have
placed
on
the
side
of
your
head
in
order
not
to
ruffle
your
nicely
combed
hair
you
content
yourself
with
saying
day
and
there
are
proud
dabblers
in
a
little
latin
who
from
having
studied
in
manila
or
in
europe
believe
that
they
have
the
right
to
shake
a
priest
hand
instead
of
kissing
it
ah
the
day
of
judgment
will
quickly
come
the
world
will
end
as
many
saints
have
foretold
it
will
rain
fire
stones
and
ashes
to
chastise
your
pride
the
people
were
exhorted
not
to
imitate
such
savages
but
to
hate
and
shun
them
since
they
were
beyond
the
religious
pale
hear
what
the
holy
decrees
say
when
an
indian
meets
a
curate
in
the
street
he
should
bow
his
head
and
offer
his
neck
for
his
master
to
step
upon
if
the
curate
and
the
indian
are
both
on
horseback
then
the
indian
should
stop
and
take
off
his
hat
or
salakot
reverently
and
finally
if
the
indian
is
on
horseback
and
the
curate
on
foot
the
indian
should
alight
and
not
mount
again
until
the
curate
has
told
him
to
go
on
or
is
far
away
this
is
what
the
holy
decrees
say
and
he
who
does
not
obey
will
be
excommunicated
and
when
one
is
riding
a
carabao
asked
a
scrupulous
countryman
of
his
neighbor
then
keep
on
going
answered
the
latter
who
was
a
casuist
but
in
spite
of
the
cries
and
gestures
of
the
preacher
many
fell
asleep
or
wandered
in
their
attention
since
these
sermons
were
ever
the
same
in
vain
some
devout
women
tried
to
sigh
and
sob
over
the
sins
of
the
wicked
they
had
to
desist
in
the
attempt
from
lack
of
supporters
even
sister
puté
was
thinking
of
something
quite
different
a
man
beside
her
had
dropped
off
to
sleep
in
such
a
way
that
he
had
fallen
over
and
crushed
her
habit
so
the
good
woman
caught
up
one
of
her
clogs
and
with
blows
began
to
wake
him
crying
out
get
away
savage
brute
devil
carabao
cur
accursed
naturally
this
caused
somewhat
of
a
stir
the
preacher
paused
and
arched
his
eyebrows
surprised
at
so
great
a
scandal
indignation
choked
the
words
in
his
throat
and
he
was
able
only
to
bellow
while
he
pounded
the
pulpit
with
his
fists
this
had
the
desired
effect
however
for
the
old
woman
though
still
grumbling
dropped
her
clog
and
crossing
herself
repeatedly
fell
devoutly
upon
her
knees
aaah
aaah
the
indignant
priest
was
at
last
able
to
roar
out
as
he
crossed
his
arms
and
shook
his
head
for
this
do
i
preach
to
you
the
whole
morning
savages
here
in
the
house
of
god
you
quarrel
and
curse
shameless
ones
aaaah
you
respect
nothing
this
is
the
result
of
the
luxury
and
the
looseness
of
the
age
that
just
what
i
told
you
aah
upon
this
theme
he
continued
to
preach
for
half
an
hour
the
alcalde
snored
and
maria
clara
nodded
for
the
poor
child
could
no
longer
keep
from
sleeping
since
she
had
no
more
paintings
or
images
to
study
nor
anything
else
to
amuse
her
on
ibarra
the
words
and
allusions
made
no
more
impression
for
he
was
thinking
of
a
cottage
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
and
saw
maria
clara
in
the
garden
let
men
crawl
about
in
their
miserable
towns
in
the
depths
of
the
valley
padre
salvi
had
caused
the
altar
bell
to
be
rung
twice
but
this
was
only
adding
fuel
to
the
flame
for
padre
damaso
became
stubborn
and
prolonged
the
sermon
fray
sibyla
gnawed
at
his
lips
and
repeatedly
adjusted
his
fray
manuel
martin
was
the
only
one
who
appeared
to
listen
with
pleasure
for
he
was
smiling
but
at
last
god
said
enough
the
orator
became
weary
and
descended
from
the
pulpit
all
knelt
to
render
thanks
to
god
the
alcalde
rubbed
his
eyes
stretched
out
one
arm
as
if
to
waken
himself
and
yawned
with
a
deep
the
mass
continued
when
all
were
kneeling
and
the
priests
had
lowered
their
heads
while
the
was
being
sung
a
man
murmured
in
ibarra
ear
at
the
laying
of
the
cornerstone
do
move
away
from
the
curate
do
go
down
into
the
trench
do
go
near
the
stone
your
life
depends
upon
it
ibarra
turned
to
see
elias
who
as
soon
as
he
had
said
this
disappeared
in
the
crowd
chapter
xxxii
the
derrick
the
yellowish
individual
had
kept
his
word
for
it
was
no
simple
derrick
that
he
had
erected
above
the
open
trench
to
let
the
heavy
block
of
granite
down
into
its
place
it
was
not
the
simple
tripod
that
ñor
juan
had
wanted
for
suspending
a
pulley
from
its
top
but
was
much
more
being
at
once
a
machine
and
an
ornament
a
grand
and
imposing
ornament
over
eight
meters
in
height
rose
the
confused
and
complicated
scaffolding
four
thick
posts
sunk
in
the
ground
served
as
a
frame
fastened
to
each
other
by
huge
timbers
crossing
diagonally
and
joined
by
large
nails
driven
in
only
perhaps
for
the
reason
that
the
apparatus
was
simply
for
temporary
use
and
thus
might
easily
be
taken
down
again
huge
cables
stretched
from
all
sides
gave
an
appearance
of
solidity
and
grandeur
to
the
whole
at
the
top
it
was
crowned
with
banners
streaming
pennants
and
enormous
garlands
of
flowers
and
leaves
artistically
interwoven
there
at
the
top
in
the
shadow
made
by
the
posts
the
garlands
and
the
banners
hung
fastened
with
cords
and
iron
hooks
an
unusually
large
pulley
over
the
polished
sides
of
which
passed
in
a
crotch
three
cables
even
larger
than
the
others
these
held
suspended
the
smooth
massive
stone
hollowed
out
in
the
center
to
form
with
a
similar
hole
in
the
lower
stone
already
in
place
the
little
space
intended
to
contain
the
records
of
contemporaneous
history
such
as
newspapers
manuscripts
money
medals
and
the
like
and
perhaps
to
transmit
them
to
very
remote
generations
the
cables
extended
downward
and
connected
with
another
equally
large
pulley
at
the
bottom
of
the
apparatus
whence
they
passed
to
the
drum
of
a
windlass
held
in
place
by
means
of
heavy
timbers
this
windlass
which
could
be
turned
with
two
cranks
increased
the
strength
of
a
man
a
hundredfold
by
the
movement
of
notched
wheels
although
it
is
true
that
what
was
gained
in
force
was
lost
in
velocity
look
said
the
yellowish
individual
turning
the
crank
look
ñor
juan
how
with
merely
my
own
strength
i
can
raise
and
lower
the
great
stone
it
so
well
arranged
that
at
will
i
can
regulate
the
rise
or
fall
inch
by
inch
so
that
a
man
in
the
trench
can
easily
fit
the
stones
together
while
i
manage
it
from
here
ñor
juan
could
not
but
gaze
in
admiration
at
the
speaker
who
was
smiling
in
his
peculiar
way
curious
bystanders
made
remarks
praising
the
yellowish
individual
who
taught
you
mechanics
asked
ñor
juan
my
father
my
dead
father
was
the
answer
accompanied
by
his
peculiar
smile
who
taught
your
father
don
saturnino
the
grandfather
of
don
crisostomo
i
did
know
that
don
saturnino
oh
he
knew
a
lot
of
things
he
not
only
beat
his
laborers
well
and
exposed
them
out
in
the
sun
but
he
also
knew
how
to
wake
the
sleepers
and
put
the
waking
to
sleep
you
see
in
time
what
my
father
taught
me
you
see
here
the
yellowish
individual
smiled
again
but
in
a
strange
way
on
a
tame
covered
with
a
piece
of
persian
tapestry
rested
a
leaden
cylinder
containing
the
objects
that
were
to
be
kept
in
the
receptacle
and
a
glass
case
with
thick
sides
which
would
hold
that
mummy
of
an
epoch
and
preserve
for
the
future
the
records
of
a
past
tasio
the
sage
who
was
walking
about
there
thoughtfully
murmured
perchance
some
day
when
this
edifice
which
is
today
begun
has
grown
old
and
after
many
vicissitudes
has
fallen
into
ruins
either
from
the
visitations
of
nature
or
the
destructive
hand
of
man
and
above
the
ruins
grow
the
ivy
and
the
moss
then
when
time
has
destroyed
the
moss
and
ivy
and
scattered
the
ashes
of
the
ruins
themselves
to
the
winds
wiping
from
the
pages
of
history
the
recollection
of
it
and
of
those
who
destroyed
it
long
since
lost
from
the
memory
of
man
perchance
when
the
races
have
been
buried
in
their
mantle
of
earth
or
have
disappeared
only
by
accident
the
pick
of
some
miner
striking
a
spark
from
this
rock
will
dig
up
mysteries
and
enigmas
from
the
depths
of
the
soil
perchance
the
learned
men
of
the
nation
that
dwells
in
these
regions
will
labor
as
do
the
present
egyptologists
with
the
remains
of
a
great
civilization
which
occupied
itself
with
eternity
little
dreaming
that
upon
it
was
descending
so
long
a
night
perchance
some
learned
professor
will
say
to
his
students
of
five
or
six
years
of
age
in
a
language
spoken
by
all
mankind
after
studying
and
examining
carefully
the
objects
found
in
the
depths
of
our
soil
after
deciphering
some
symbols
and
translating
a
few
words
we
can
without
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
conclude
that
these
objects
belonged
to
the
barbaric
age
of
man
to
that
obscure
era
which
we
are
accustomed
to
speak
of
as
fabulous
in
short
gentlemen
in
order
that
you
may
form
an
approximate
idea
of
the
backwardness
of
our
ancestors
it
will
be
sufficient
that
i
point
out
to
you
the
fact
that
those
who
lived
here
not
only
recognized
kings
but
also
for
the
purpose
of
settling
questions
of
local
government
they
had
to
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
earth
just
as
if
we
should
say
that
a
body
in
order
to
move
itself
would
need
to
consult
a
head
existing
in
another
part
of
the
globe
perhaps
in
regions
now
sunk
under
the
waves
this
incredible
defect
however
improbable
it
may
seem
to
us
now
must
have
existed
if
we
take
into
consideration
the
circumstances
surrounding
those
beings
whom
i
scarcely
dare
to
call
human
in
those
primitive
times
men
were
still
or
at
least
so
they
believed
in
direct
communication
with
their
creator
since
they
had
ministers
from
him
beings
different
from
the
rest
designated
always
with
the
mysterious
letters
concerning
the
meaning
of
which
our
learned
men
do
not
agree
according
to
the
professor
of
languages
whom
we
have
here
rather
mediocre
since
he
does
not
speak
more
than
a
hundred
of
the
imperfect
languages
of
the
past
may
signify
rico
these
ministers
were
a
species
of
demigods
very
virtuous
and
enlightened
and
were
very
eloquent
orators
who
in
spite
of
their
great
power
and
prestige
never
committed
the
slightest
fault
which
fact
strengthens
my
belief
in
supposing
that
they
were
of
a
nature
distinct
from
the
rest
if
this
were
not
sufficient
to
sustain
my
belief
there
yet
remains
the
argument
disputed
by
no
one
and
day
by
day
confirmed
that
these
mysterious
beings
could
make
god
descend
to
earth
merely
by
saying
a
few
words
that
god
could
speak
only
through
their
mouths
that
they
ate
his
flesh
and
drank
his
blood
and
even
at
times
allowed
the
common
folk
to
do
the
same
these
and
other
opinions
the
skeptical
sage
put
into
the
mouths
of
all
the
corrupt
men
of
the
future
perhaps
as
may
easily
be
the
case
old
tasio
was
mistaken
but
we
must
return
to
our
story
in
the
kiosks
which
we
saw
two
days
ago
occupied
by
the
schoolmaster
and
his
pupils
there
was
now
spread
out
a
toothsome
and
abundant
meal
noteworthy
is
the
fact
that
on
the
table
prepared
for
the
school
children
there
was
not
a
single
bottle
of
wine
but
an
abundance
of
fruits
in
the
arbors
joining
the
two
kiosks
were
the
seats
for
the
musicians
and
a
table
covered
with
sweetmeats
and
confections
with
bottles
of
water
for
the
thirsty
public
all
decorated
with
leaves
and
flowers
the
schoolmaster
had
erected
near
by
a
greased
pole
and
hurdles
and
had
hung
up
pots
and
pans
for
a
number
of
games
the
crowd
resplendent
in
garments
gathered
as
people
fled
from
the
burning
sun
some
into
the
shade
of
the
trees
others
under
the
arbor
the
boys
climbed
up
into
the
branches
or
on
the
stones
in
order
to
see
the
ceremony
better
making
up
in
this
way
for
their
short
stature
they
looked
with
envy
at
the
clean
and
school
children
who
occupied
a
place
especially
assigned
to
them
and
whose
parents
were
overjoyed
as
they
poor
country
folk
would
see
their
children
eat
from
a
white
tablecloth
almost
the
same
as
the
curate
or
the
alcalde
thinking
of
this
alone
was
enough
to
drive
away
hunger
and
such
an
event
would
be
recounted
from
father
to
son
soon
were
heard
the
distant
strains
of
the
band
which
was
preceded
by
a
motley
throng
made
up
of
persons
of
all
ages
in
clothing
of
all
colors
the
yellowish
individual
became
uneasy
and
with
a
glance
examined
his
whole
apparatus
a
curious
countryman
followed
his
glance
and
watched
all
his
movements
this
was
elias
who
had
also
come
to
witness
the
ceremony
but
in
his
salakot
and
rough
attire
he
was
almost
unrecognizable
he
had
secured
a
very
good
position
almost
at
the
side
of
the
windlass
on
the
edge
of
the
excavation
with
the
music
came
the
alcalde
the
municipal
officials
the
friars
with
the
exception
of
padre
damaso
and
the
spanish
employees
ibarra
was
conversing
with
the
alcalde
of
whom
he
had
made
quite
a
friend
since
he
had
addressed
to
him
some
compliments
over
his
decorations
and
ribbons
for
aristocratic
pretensions
were
the
weakness
of
his
honor
capitan
tiago
the
alferez
and
some
other
wealthy
personages
came
in
the
gilded
cluster
of
maidens
displaying
their
silken
parasols
padre
salvi
followed
silent
and
thoughtful
as
ever
count
upon
my
support
always
in
any
worthy
enterprise
the
alcalde
was
saying
to
ibarra
i
will
give
you
whatever
appropriation
you
need
or
else
see
that
it
is
furnished
by
others
as
they
drew
nearer
the
youth
felt
his
heart
beat
faster
instinctively
he
glanced
at
the
strange
scaffolding
raised
there
he
saw
the
yellowish
individual
salute
him
respectfully
and
gaze
at
him
fixedly
for
a
moment
with
surprise
he
noticed
elias
who
with
a
significant
wink
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
should
remember
the
warning
in
the
church
the
curate
put
on
his
sacerdotal
robes
and
commenced
the
ceremony
while
the
sacristan
held
the
book
and
an
acolyte
the
hyssop
and
jar
of
holy
water
the
rest
stood
about
him
uncovered
and
maintained
such
a
profound
silence
that
in
spite
of
his
reading
in
a
low
tone
it
was
apparent
that
padre
salvi
voice
was
trembling
meanwhile
there
had
been
placed
in
the
glass
case
the
manuscripts
newspapers
medals
coins
and
the
like
and

hermetically

its
place

waiting
murmured
the
alcalde
into
the
young
man
ear
i
would
with
great
pleasure
answered
the
latter
but
that
would
be
usurping
the
honorable
duty
of
the
escribano
the
escribano
must
make
affidavit
of
the
act
so
the
escribano
gravely
took
the
box
descended
the
carpeted
stairway
leading
to
the
bottom
of
the
excavation
and
with
due
solemnity
placed
it
in
the
hole
in
the
stone
the
curate
then
took
the
hyssop
and
sprinkled
the
stones
with
holy
water
now
the
moment
had
arrived
for
each
one
to
place
his
trowelful
of
mortar
on
the
face
of
the
large
stone
lying
in
the
trench
in
order
that
the
other
might
be
fitted
and
fastened
to
it
ibarra
handed
the
alcalde
a
mason
trowel
on
the
wide
silver
made
of
which
was
engraved
the
date
but
the
alcalde

many
voices
were
raised
in
answer
adding
long
live
the
señor
alcalde
he
then
majestically
descended
to
the
strains
of
the
band
which
began
to
play
deposited
several
trowelfuls
of
mortar
on
the
stone
and
with
equal
majesty
reascended
the
employees
applauded
ibarra
offered
another
trowel
to
the
curate
who
after
fixing
his
eyes
on
him
for
a
moment
descended
slowly
down
the
steps
he
raised
his
eyes
to
look
at
the
stone
which
hung
fastened
by
the
stout
cables
but
this
was
only
for
a
second
and
he
then
went
on
down
he
did
the
same
as
the
alcalde
but
this
time
more
applause
was
heard
for
to
the
employees
were
added
some
friars
and
capitan
tiago
padre
salvi
then
seemed
to
seek
for
some
one
to
whom
he
might
give
the
trowel
he
looked
doubtfully
at
maria
clara
but
changing
his
mind
offered
it
to
the
escribano
the
latter
in
gallantry
offered
it
to
maria
clara
who
smilingly
refused
it
the
friars
the
employees
and
the
alferez
went
down
one
after
another
nor
was
capitan
tiago
forgotten
ibarra
only
was
left
and
the
order
was
about
to
be
given
for
the
yellowish
individual
to
lower
the
stone
when
the
curate
remembered
the
youth
and
said
to
him
in
a
joking
tone
with
affected
familiarity
are
you
going
to
put
on
your
trowelful
señor
ibarra
i
should
be
a
juan
palomo
to
prepare
the
meal
and
eat
it
myself
answered
the
latter
in
the
same
tone
go
on
said
the
alcalde
shoving
him
forward
gently
otherwise
i
order
that
the
stone
be
not
lowered
at
all
and
we
be
here
until
doomsday
before
such
a
terrible
threat
ibarra
had
to
obey
he
exchanged
the
small
silver
trowel
for
a
large
iron
one
an
act
which
caused
some
of
the
spectators
to
smile
and
went
forward
tranquilly
elias
gazed
at
him
with
such
an
indefinable
expression
that
on
seeing
it
one
might
have
said
that
his
whole
life
was
concentrated
in
his
eyes
the
yellowish
individual
stared
into
the
trench
which
opened
at
his
feet
after
directing
a
rapid
glance
at
the
heavy
stone
hanging
over
his
head
and
another
at
elias
and
the
yellowish
individual
ibarra
said
to
ñor
juan
in
a
somewhat
unsteady
voice
give
me
the
mortar
and
get
me
another
trowel
up
there
the
youth
remained
alone
elias
no
longer
looked
at
him
for
his
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
hand
of
the
yellowish
individual
who
leaning
over
the
trench
was
anxiously
following
the
movements
of
ibarra
there
was
heard
the
noise
of
the
trowel
scraping
on
the
stone
in
the
midst
of
a
feeble
murmur
among
the
employees
who
were
congratulating
the
alcalde
on
his
speech
suddenly
a
crash
was
heard
the
pulley
tied
at
the
base
of
the
derrick
jumped
up
and
after
it
the
windlass
which
struck
the
heavy
posts
like
a
the
timbers
shook
the
fastenings
flew
apart
and
the
whole
apparatus
fell
in
a
second
with
a
frightful
crash
a
cloud
of
dust
arose
while
a
cry
of
horror
from
a
thousand
voices
filled
the
air
nearly
all
fled
only
a
few
dashed
toward
the
trench
maria
clara
and
padre
salvi
remained
in
their
places
pale
motionless
and
speechless
when
the
dust
had
cleared
away
a
little
they
saw
ibarra
standing
among
beams
posts
and
cables
between
the
windlass
and
the
heavy
stone
which
in
its
rapid
descent
had
shaken
and
crushed
everything
the
youth
still
held
the
trowel
in
his
hand
and
was
staring
with
frightened
eyes
at
the
body
of
a
man
which
lay
at
his
feet
among
the
timbers
you
not
killed
you
still
alive
for
god
sake
speak
cried
several
employees
full
of
terror
and
solicitude
a
miracle
a
miracle
shouted
some
come
and
extricate
the
body
of
this
poor
devil
exclaimed
ibarra
like
one
arousing
himself
from
sleep
on
hearing
his
voice
maria
clara
felt
her
strength
leave
her
and
fell
into
the
arms
of
her
friends
great
confusion
prevailed
all
were
talking
gesticulating
running
about
descending
into
the
trench
coming
up
again
all
amazed
and
terrified
who
is
the
dead
man
is
he
still
alive
asked
the
alferez
the
corpse
was
identified
as
that
of
the
yellowish
individual
who
had
been
operating
the
windlass
arrest
the
foreman
on
the
work
was
the
first
thing
that
the
alcalde
was
able
to
say
they
examined
the
corpse
placing
their
hands
on
the
chest
but
the
heart
had
ceased
to
beat
the
blow
had
struck
him
on
the
head
and
blood
was
flowing
from
his
nose
mouth
and
ears
on
his
neck
were
to
be
noticed
some
peculiar
marks
four
deep
depressions
toward
the
back
and
one
more
somewhat
larger
on
the
other
side
which
induced
the
belief
that
a
hand
of
steel
had
caught
him
as
in
a
pair
of
pincers
the
priests
felicitated
the
youth
warmly
and
shook
his
hand
the
franciscan
of
humble
aspect
who
had
served
as
holy
ghost
for
padre
damaso
exclaimed
with
tearful
eyes
god
is
just
god
is
good
when
i
think
that
a
few
moments
before
i
was
down
there
said
one
of
the
employees
to
ibarra
what
if
i
had
happened
to
be
the
last
it
makes
my
hair
stand
on
end
remarked
another
partly
bald
individual
i
glad
that
it
happened
to
you
and
not
to
me
murmured
an
old
man
tremblingly
don
pascual
exclaimed
some
of
the
spaniards
i
say
that
because
the
young
man
is
not
dead
if
i
had
not
been
crushed
i
should
have
died
afterwards
merely
from
thinking
about
it
but
ibarra
was
already
at
a
distance
informing
himself
as
to
maria
clara
condition
do
let
this
stop
the
fiesta
señor
ibarra
said
the
alcalde
praise
god
the
dead
man
is
neither
a
priest
nor
a
spaniard
we
must
rejoice
over
your
escape
think
if
the
stone
had
caught
you
there
are
presentiments
there
are
presentiments
exclaimed
the
escribano
i
said
so
before
señor
ibarra
did
go
down
willingly
i
saw
it
the
dead
man
is
only
an
indian
let
the
fiesta
go
on
music
sadness
will
never
resuscitate
the
dead
an
investigation
shall
be
made
right
here
send
for
the
directorcillo
arrest
the
foreman
on
the
work
to
the
stocks
with
him
to
the
stocks
music
to
the
stocks
with
the
foreman
señor
alcalde
said
ibarra
gravely
if
mourning
will
not
resuscitate
the
dead
much
less
will
arresting
this
man
about
whose
guilt
we
know
nothing
i
will
be
security
for
his
person
and
so
i
ask
his
liberty
for
these
days
at
least
very
well
but
do
let
him
do
it
again
all
kinds
of
rumors
began
to
circulate
the
idea
of
a
miracle
was
soon
an
accepted
fact
although
fray
salvi
seemed
to
rejoice
but
little
over
a
miracle
attributed
to
a
saint
of
his
order
and
in
his
parish
there
were
not
lacking
those
who
added
that
they
had
seen
descending
into
the
trench
when
everything
was
tumbling
down
a
figure
in
a
dark
robe
like
that
of
the
franciscans
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
it
was
san
diego
himself
it
was
also
noted
that
ibarra
had
attended
mass
and
that
the
yellowish
individual
had
not
it
was
all
as
clear
as
the
sun
you
see
you
did
want
to
go
to
mass
said
a
mother
to
her
son
if
i
had
whipped
you
to
make
you
go
you
would
now
be
on
your
way
to
the
town
hall
like
him
in
a
cart
the
yellowish
individual
or
rather
his
corpse
wrapped
up
in
a
mat
was
in
fact
being
carried
to
the
town
hall
ibarra
hurried
home
to
change
his
clothes
a
bad
beginning
huh
commented
old
tasio
as
he
moved
away
chapter
xxxiii
free
thought
ibarra
was
just
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
a
change
of
clothing
when
a
servant
informed
him
that
a
countryman
was
asking
for
him
supposing
it
to
be
one
of
his
laborers
he
ordered
that
he
be
brought
into
his
office
or
study
which
was
at
the
same
time
a
library
and
a
chemical
laboratory
greatly
to
his
surprise
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
severe
and
mysterious
figure
of
elias
you
saved
my
life
said
the
pilot
in
tagalog
noticing
start
of
surprise
i
have
partly
paid
the
debt
and
you
have
nothing
to
thank
me
for
but
quite
the
opposite
i
come
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
speak
answered
the
youth
in
the
same
language
puzzled
by
the
pilot
gravity
elias
stared
into
ibarra
eyes
for
some
seconds
before
he
replied
when
human
courts
try
to
clear
up
this
mystery
i
beg
of
you
not
to
speak
to
any
one
of
the
warning
that
i
gave
you
in
the
church
do
worry
answered
the
youth
in
a
rather
disgusted
tone
i
know
that
you
wanted
but
i
no
informer
oh
it
not
on
my
account
not
on
my
account
exclaimed
elias
with
some
vigor
and
haughtiness
it
on
your
own
account
i
fear
nothing
from
men
ibarra
surprise
increased
the
tone
in
which
this
rustics
formerly
a
pilot
spoke
was
new
and
did
not
seem
to
harmonize
with
either
his
condition
or
his
fortune
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
interrogating
that
mysterious
individual
with
his
looks
i
do
not
talk
in
enigmas
but
try
to
express
myself
clearly
for
your
greater
security
it
is
better
that
your
enemies
think
you
unsuspecting
and
unprepared
ibarra
recoiled
my
enemies
have
i
enemies
all
of
us
have
them
sir
from
the
smallest
insect
up
to
man
from
the
poorest
and
humblest
to
the
richest
and
most
powerful
enmity
is
the
law
of
life
ibarra
gazed
at
him
in
silence
for
a
while
then
murmured
you
are
neither
a
pilot
nor
a
rustic
you
have
enemies
in
high
and
low
places
continued
elias
without
heeding
the
young
man
words
you
are
planning
a
great
undertaking
you
have
a
past
your
father
and
your
grandfather
had
enemies
because
they
had
passions
and
in
life
it
is
not
the
criminal
who
provokes
the
most
hate
but
the
honest
man
do
you
know
who
my
enemies
are
elias
meditated
for
a
moment
i
knew
one
him
who
is
dead
he
finally
answered
last
night
i
learned
that
a
plot
against
you
was
being
hatched
from
some
words
exchanged
with
an
unknown
person
who
lost
himself
in
the
crowd
fish
will
not
eat
him
as
they
did
his
father
you
see
tomorrow
the
unknown
said
these
words
caught
my
attention
not
only
by
their
meaning
but
also
on
account
of
the
person
who
uttered
them
for
he
had
some
days
before
presented
himself
to
the
foreman
on
the
work
with
the
express
request
that
he
be
allowed
to
superintend
the
placing
of
the
stone
he
did
ask
for
much
pay
but
made
a
show
of
great
knowledge
i
had
sufficient
reason
for
believing
in
his
bad
intentions
but
something
within
told
me
that
my
conjectures
were
true
and
therefore
i
chose
as
the
suitable
occasion
to
warn
you
a
moment
when
you
could
not
ask
me
any
questions
the
rest
you
have
seen
for
yourself
for
a
long
time
after
elias
had
become
silent
ibarra
remained
thoughtful
not
answering
him
or
saying
a
word
i
sorry
that
that
man
is
dead
he
exclaimed
at
length
from
him
something
more
might
have
been
learned
if
he
had
lived
he
would
have
escaped
from
the
trembling
hand
of
blind
human
justice
god
has
judged
him
god
has
killed
him
let
god
be
the
only
judge
crisostomo
gazed
for
a
moment
at
the
man
who
while
he
spoke
thus
exposed
his
muscular
arms
covered
with
lumps
and
bruises
do
you
also
believe
in
the
miracle
he
asked
with
a
smile
you
know
what
a
miracle
the
people
are
talking
about
were
i
to
believe
in
miracles
i
should
not
believe
in
god
i
should
believe
in
a
deified
man
i
should
believe
that
man
had
really
created
a
god
in
his
own
image
and
likeness
the
mysterious
pilot
answered
solemnly
but
i
believe
in
him
i
have
felt
his
hand
more
than
once
when
the
whole
apparatus
was
falling
down
and
threatening
destruction
to
all
who
happened
to
be
near
it
i
i
myself
caught
the
criminal
i
placed
myself
at
his
side
he
was
struck
and
i
am
safe
and
sound
you
so
it
was
you
yes
i
caught
him
when
he
tried
to
escape
once
his
deadly
work
had
begun
i
saw
his
crime
and
i
say
this
to
you
let
god
be
the
sole
judge
among
men
let
him
be
the
only
one
to
have
the
right
over
life
let
no
man
ever
think
to
take
his
place
but
you
in
this
instance
no
interrupted
elias
guessing
the
objection
it
not
the
same
when
a
man
condemns
others
to
death
or
destroys
their
future
forever
he
does
it
with
impunity
and
uses
the
strength
of
others
to
execute
his
judgments
which
after
all
may
be
mistaken
or
erroneous
but
i
in
exposing
the
criminal
to
the
same
peril
that
he
had
prepared
for
others
incurred
the
same
risk
as
he
did
i
did
not
kill
him
but
let
the
hand
of
god
smite
him
then
you
do
believe
in
accidents
believing
in
accidents
is
like
believing
in
miracles
both
presuppose
that
god
does
not
know
the
future
what
is
an
accident
an
event
that
no
one
has
at
all
foreseen
what
is
a
miracle
a
contradiction
an
overturning
of
natural
laws
lack
of
foresight
and
contradiction
in
the
intelligence
that
rules
the
machinery
of
the
world
indicate
two
great
defects
who
are
you
ibarra
again
asked
with
some
awe
have
you
ever
studied
i
have
had
to
believe
greatly
in
god
because
i
have
lost
faith
in
men
answered
the
pilot
avoiding
the
question
ibarra
thought
he
understood
this
hunted
youth
he
rejected
human
justice
he
refused
to
recognize
the
right
of
man
to
judge
his
fellows
he
protested
against
force
and
the
superiority
of
some
classes
over
others
but
nevertheless
you
must
admit
the
necessity
of
human
justice
however
imperfect
it
may
be
he
answered
god
in
spite
of
the
many
ministers
he
may
have
on
earth
can
not
or
rather
does
not
pronounce
his
judgments
clearly
to
settle
the
million
conflicts
that
our
passions
excite
it
is
proper
it
is
necessary
it
is
just
that
man
sometimes
judge
his
fellows
yes
to
do
good
but
not
to
do
ill
to
correct
and
to
better
but
not
to
destroy
for
if
his
judgments
are
wrong
he
has
the
power
to
remedy
the
evil
he
has
done
but
he
added
with
a
change
of
tone
this
discussion
is
beyond
my
powers
and
i
detaining
you
who
are
being
waited
for
do
forget
what
i
just
told
you
you
have
enemies
take
care
of
yourself
for
the
good
of
our
country
saying
this
he
turned
to
go
when
shall
i
see
you
again
asked
ibarra
whenever
you
wish
and
always
when
i
can
be
of
service
to
you
i
am
still

chapter
xxxiv
the
dinner
there
in
the
decorated
kiosk
the
great
men
of
the
province
were
dining
the
alcalde
occupied
one
end
of
the
table
and
ibarra
the
other
at
the
young
man
right
sat
maria
clara
and
at
his
left
the
escribano
capitan
tiago
the
alferez
the
gobernadorcillo
the
friars
the
employees
and
the
few
young
ladies
who
had
remained
sat
not
according
to
rank
but
according
to
their
inclinations
the
meal
was
quite
animated
and
happy
when
the
dinner
was
half
over
a
messenger
came
in
search
of
capitan
tiago
with
a
telegram
to
open
which
he
naturally
requested
the
permission
of
the
others
who
very
naturally
begged
him
to
do
so
the
worthy
capitan
at
first
knitted
his
eyebrows
then
raised
them
his
face
became
pale
then
lighted
up
as
he
hastily
folded
the
paper
and
arose
gentlemen
he
announced
in
confusion
his
excellency
the
is
coming
this
evening
to
honor
my
house
thereupon
he
set
off
at
a
run
hatless
taking
with
him
the
message
and
his
napkin
he
was
followed
by
exclamations
and
questions
for
a
cry
of
tulisanes
would
not
have
produced
greater
effect
but
listen
when
is
he
coming
tell
us
about
it
his
excellency
but
capitan
tiago
was
already
far
away
his
excellency
is
coming
and
will
stay
at
capitan
tiago
exclaimed
some
without
taking
into
consideration
the
fact
that
his
daughter
and
future
were
present
the
choice
could
be
better
answered
the
latter
the
friars
gazed
at
one
another
with
looks
that
seemed
to
say
the
is
playing
another
one
of
his
tricks
he
is
slighting
us
for
he
ought
to
stay
at
the
convento
but
since
this
was
the
thought
of
all
they
remained
silent
none
of
them
giving
expression
to
it
i
was
told
of
this
yesterday
said
the
alcalde
but
at
that
time
his
excellency
had
not
yet
fully
decided
do
you
know
señor
alcalde
how
long
the
thinks
of
staying
here
asked
the
alferez
uneasily
with
certainty
no
his
excellency
likes
to
give
surprises
here
come
some
more
messages
these
were
for
the
alcalde
the
alferez
and
the
gobernadorcillo
and
contained
the
same
announcement
the
friars
noted
well
that
none
came
directed
to
the
curate
his
excellency
will
arrive
at
four
this
afternoon
gentlemen
announced
the
alcalde
solemnly
so
we
can
finish
our
meal
in
peace
leonidas
at
thermopylae
could
not
have
said
more
cheerfully
tonight
we
shall
sup
with
pluto
the
conversation
again
resumed
its
ordinary
course
i
note
the
absence
of
our
great
preacher
timidly
remarked
an
employee
of
inoffensive
aspect
who
had
not
opened
his
mouth
up
to
the
time
of
eating
and
who
spoke
now
for
the
first
time
in
the
whole
morning
all
who
knew
the
history
of
crisostomo
father
made
a
movement
and
winked
as
if
to
say
get
out
fools
rush
in
but
some
one
more
charitably
disposed
answered
he
must
be
rather
tired
rather
exclaimed
the
alferez
he
must
be
exhausted
and
as
they
say
here
all
fagged
out
what
a
sermon
it
was
a
splendid
sermon
wonderful
said
the
escribano
magnificent
profound
added
the
correspondent
to
be
able
to
talk
so
much
it
necessary
to
have
the
lungs
that
he
has
observed
padre
manuel
martin
the
augustinian
did
not
concede
him
anything
more
than
lungs
and
his
fertility
of
expression
added
padre
salvi
do
you
know
that
señor
ibarra
has
the
best
cook
in
the
province
remarked
the
alcalde
to
cut
short
such
talk
you
may
well
say
that
but
his
beautiful
neighbor
does
wish
to
honor
the
table
for
she
is
scarcely
eating
a
bite
observed
one
of
the
employees
maria
clara
blushed
i
thank
the
gentleman
he
troubles
himself
too
much
on
my
account
she
stammered
timidly
but
but
you
honor
it
enough
merely
by
being
present
concluded
the
gallant
alcalde
as
he
turned
to
padre
salvi
padre
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
i
observed
that
during
the
whole
day
your
reverence
has
been
silent
and
thoughtful
the
alcalde
is
a
great
observer
remarked
fray
sibyla
in
a
meaning
tone
it
a
habit
of
mine
stammered
the
franciscan
it
pleases
me
more
to
listen
than
to
talk
your
reverence
always
takes
care
to
win
and
not
to
lose
said
the
alferez
in
a
jesting
tone
padre
salvi
however
did
not
take
this
as
a
joke
for
his
gaze
brightened
a
moment
as
he
replied
the
alferez
knows
very
well
these
days
that
i
not
the
one
who
is
winning
or
losing
most
the
alferez
turned
the
hit
aside
with
a
forced
laugh
pretending
not
to
take
it
to
himself
but
gentlemen
i
do
understand
how
it
is
possible
to
talk
of
winnings
and
losses
interposed
the
alcalde
what
will
these
amiable
and
discreet
young
ladies
who
honor
us
with
their
company
think
of
us
for
me
the
young
women
are
like
the
æolian
harps
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
is
necessary
to
listen
with
close
attention
in
order
that
their
ineffable
harmonies
may
elevate
the
soul
to
the
celestial
spheres
of
the
infinite
and
the
ideal
your
honor
is
becoming
poetical
exclaimed
the
escribano
gleefully
and
both
emptied
their
i
ca
help
it
said
the
alcalde
as
he
wiped
his
lips
opportunity
while
it
does
always
make
the
thief
makes
the
poet
in
my
youth
i
composed
verses
which
were
really
not
bad
so
your
excellency
has
been
unfaithful
to
the
muses
to
follow
themis
emphatically
declared
our
mythical
or
mythological
correspondent
pshaw
what
would
you
have
to
run
through
the
entire
social
scale
was
always
my
dream
yesterday
i
was
gathering
flowers
and
singing
songs
today
i
wield
the
rod
of
justice
and
serve
humanity
tomorrow
tomorrow
your
honor
will
throw
the
rod
into
the
fire
to
warm
yourself
by
it
in
the
winter
of
life
and
take
an
appointment
in
the
cabinet
added
padre
sibyla
pshaw
yes
no
to
be
a
cabinet
official
is
exactly
my
any
upstart
may
become
one
a
villa
in
the
north
in
which
to
spend
the
summer
a
mansion
in
madrid
and
some
property
in
andalusia
for
the
winter
there
we
shall
live
remembering
our
beloved
philippines
of
me
voltaire
would
not
say
have
lived
among
these
people
only
to
enrich
ourselves
and
to
calumniate
them
the
alcalde
quoted
this
in
french
so
the
employees
thinking
that
his
honor
had
cracked
a
joke
began
to
laugh
in
appreciation
of
it
some
of
the
friars
did
likewise
since
they
did
not
know
that
the
voltaire
mentioned
was
the
same
voltaire
whom
they
had
so
often
cursed
and
consigned
to
hell
but
padre
sibyla
was
aware
of
it
and
became
serious
from
the
belief
that
the
alcalde
had
said
something
heretical
or
impious
in
the
other
kiosk
the
children
were
eating
under
the
direction
of
their
teacher
for
filipino
children
they
were
rather
noisy
since
at
the
table
and
in
the
presence
of
other
persons
their
sins
are
generally
more
of
omission
than
of
commission
perhaps
one
who
was
using
the
tableware
improperly
would
be
corrected
by
his
neighbor
and
from
this
there
would
arise
a
noisy
discussion
in
which
each
would
have
his
partisans
some
would
say
the
spoon
others
the
knife
or
the
fork
and
as
no
one
was
considered
an
authority
there
would
arise
the
contention
that
god
is
christ
or
more
clearly
a
dispute
of
theologians
their
fathers
and
mothers
winked
made
signs
nudged
one
another
and
showed
their
happiness
by
their
smiles
ya
exclaimed
a
countrywoman
to
an
old
man
who
was
mashing
buyo
in
his
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
my
husband
is
opposed
to
it
my
andoy
shall
be
a
priest
it
true
that
we
poor
but
we
work
and
if
necessary
we
beg
alms
there
are
not
lacking
those
who
will
give
money
so
that
the
poor
may
take
holy
orders
does
not
brother
mateo
a
man
who
does
not
lie
say
that
pope
sextus
was
a
herder
of
carabaos
in
batangas
well
then
look
at
my
andoy
see
if
he
already
the
face
of
a
st
vincent
the
good
mother
watered
at
the
mouth
to
see
her
son
take
hold
of
a
fork
with
both
hands
god
help
us
added
the
old
man
rolling
his
quid
of
buyo
if
andoy
gets
to
be
pope
we
go
to
rome
he
he
i
can
still
walk
well
and
if
i
die
he
he
do
worry
granddad
andoy
wo
forget
that
you
taught
him
how
to
weave
baskets
you
right
petra
i
also
believe
that
your
son
will
be
great
at
least
a
patriarch
i
have
never
seen
any
one
who
learned
the
business
in
a
shorter
time
yes
he
remember
me
when
as
pope
or
bishop
he
entertains
himself
in
making
baskets
for
his
cook
he
then
say
masses
for
my
soul
he
he
with
this
hope
the
good
old
man
again
filled
his
with
buyo
if
god
hears
my
prayers
and
my
hopes
are
fulfilled
i
say
to
andoy
take
away
all
our
sins
and
send
us
to
heaven
then
we
need
to
pray
and
fast
and
buy
indulgences
one
whose
son
is
a
blessed
pope
can
commit
sins
send
him
to
my
house
tomorrow
petra
cried
the
old
man
enthusiastically
and
i
teach
him
to
weave
the
huh
get
out
what
are
you
dreaming
about
do
you
still
think
that
the
popes
even
move
their
hands
the
curate
being
nothing
more
than
a
curate
only
works
in
the
mass
when
he
turns
around
the
archbishop
does
even
turn
around
for
he
says
mass
sitting
down
so
the
pope
the
pope
says
it
in
bed
with
a
fan
what
are
you
thinking
about
of
nothing
more
petra
than
that
he
know
how
to
weave
the
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
be
able
to
sell
hats
and
so
that
he
would
have
to
beg
alms
as
the
curate
does
here
every
year
in
the
name
of
the
pope
it
always
fills
me
with
compassion
to
see
a
saint
poor
so
i
give
all
my
savings
another
countryman
here
joined
in
the
conversation
saying
it
all
settled
cumare
my
son
has
got
to
be
a
doctor
there
nothing
like
being
a
doctor
doctor
what
are
you
talking
about
cumpare
retorted
petra
nothing
like
being
a
curate
a
curate
pish
a
curate
the
doctor
makes
lots
of
money
the
sick
people
worship
him
cumare
excuse
me
the
curate
by
making
three
or
four
turns
and
saying
eats
god
and
makes
money
all
even
the
women
tell
him
their
secrets
and
the
doctor
what
do
you
think
a
doctor
is
the
doctor
sees
all
that
the
women
have
he
feels
the
pulses
of
the
i
just
like
to
be
a
doctor
for
a
week
and
the
curate
perhaps
the
curate
does
see
what
your
doctor
sees
better
still
you
know
the
saying
fattest
chicken
and
the
roundest
leg
for
the
curate
what
of
that
do
the
doctors
eat
dried
fish
do
they
soil
their
fingers
eating
salt
does
the
curate
dirty
his
hands
as
your
doctors
do
he
has
great
estates
and
when
he
works
he
works
with
music
and
has
sacristans
to
help
him
but
the
confessing
cumare
is
that
work
no
work
about
that
i
just
like
to
be
confessing
everybody
while
we
work
and
sweat
to
find
out
what
our
own
neighbors
are
doing
the
curate
does
nothing
more
than
take
a
seat
and
they
tell
him
everything
sometimes
he
falls
asleep
but
he
lets
out
two
or
three
blessings
and
we
are
again
the
children
of
god
i
just
like
to
be
a
curate
for
one
evening
in
lent
but
the
preaching
you
ca
tell
me
that
it
not
work
just
look
how
the
fat
curate
was
sweating
this
morning
objected
the
rustic
who
felt
himself
being
beaten
into
retreat
preaching
work
to
preach
where
your
judgment
i
just
like
to
be
talking
half
a
day
from
the
pulpit
scolding
and
quarreling
with
everybody
without
any
one
daring
to
reply
and
be
getting
paid
for
it
besides
i
just
like
to
be
the
curate
for
one
morning
when
those
who
are
in
debt
to
me
are
attending
mass
look
there
now
how
padre
damaso
gets
fat
with
so
much
scolding
and
beating
padre
damaso
was
indeed
approaching
with
the
gait
of
a
heavy
man
he
was
half
smiling
but
in
such
a
malignant
way
that
ibarra
upon
seeing
him
lost
the
thread
of
his
talk
the
padre
was
greeted
with
some
surprise
but
with
signs
of
pleasure
on
the
part
of
all
except
ibarra
they
were
then
at
the
dessert
and
the
champagne
was
foaming
in
the
glasses
padre
damaso
smile
became
nervous
when
he
saw
maria
clara
seated
at
crisostomo
right
he
took
a
seat
beside
the
alcalde
and
said
in
the
midst
of
a
significant
silence
were
you
discussing
something
gentlemen
go
ahead
we
were
at
the
toasts
answered
the
alcalde
señor
ibarra
was
mentioning
all
who
have
helped
him
in
his
philanthropic
enterprise
and
was
speaking
of
the
architect
when
your
reverence
well
i
do
know
anything
about
architecture
interrupted
padre
damaso
but
i
laugh
at
architects
and
the
fools
who
employ
them
here
you
have
it
i
drew
the
plan
of
this
church
and
it
perfectly
constructed
so
an
english
jeweler
who
stopped
in
the
convento
one
day
assured
me
to
draw
a
plan
one
needs
only
to
have
two
breadth
of
forehead
nevertheless
answered
the
alcalde
seeing
that
ibarra
was
silent
when
we
consider
certain
buildings
as
for
example
this
schoolhouse
we
need
an
expert
get
out
with
your
experts
exclaimed
the
priest
with
a
sneer
only
a
fool
needs
experts
one
must
be
more
of
a
brute
than
the
indians
who
build
their
own
houses
not
to
know
how
to
construct
four
walls
and
put
a
roof
on
top
of
them
that
all
a
schoolhouse
is
the
guests
gazed
at
ibarra
who
had
turned
pale
but
he
continued
as
if
in
conversation
with
maria
clara
but
your
reverence
should
consider
see
now
went
on
the
franciscan
not
allowing
the
alcalde
to
continue
look
how
one
of
our
lay
brothers
the
most
stupid
that
we
have
has
constructed
a
hospital
good
pretty
and
cheap
he
made
them
work
hard
and
paid
only
eight
cuartos
a
day
even
to
those
who
had
to
come
from
other
towns
he
knew
how
to
handle
them
not
like
a
lot
of
cranks
and
little
mestizos
who
are
spoiling
them
by
paying
three
or
four
reals
does
your
reverence
say
that
he
paid
only
eight
cuartos
impossible
the
alcalde
was
trying
to
change
the
course
of
the
conversation
yes
sir
and
those
who
pride
themselves
on
being
good
spaniards
ought
to
imitate
him
you
see
now
since
the
suez
canal
was
opened
the
corruption
that
has
come
in
here
formerly
when
we
had
to
double
the
cape
neither
so
many
vagabonds
came
here
nor
so
many
others
went
from
here
to
become
vagabonds
but
padre
damaso
you
know
well
enough
what
the
indian
is
just
as
soon
as
he
gets
a
little
learning
he
sets
himself
up
as
a
doctor
all
these
little
fellows
that
go
to
europe
but
listen
your
reverence
interrupted
the
alcalde
who
was
becoming
nervous
over
the
aggressiveness
of
such
talk
every
one
ends
up
as
he
deserves
the
friar
continued
the
hand
of
god
is
manifest
in
the
midst
of
it
all
and
one
must
be
blind
not
to
see
it
even
in
this
life
the
fathers
of
such
vipers
receive
their
punishment
they
die
in
jail
ha
ha
as
we
might
say
they
have
nowhere
but
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
ibarra
livid
had
been
following
him
with
his
gaze
and
upon
hearing
this
allusion
to
his
father
jumped
up
and
dropped
a
heavy
hand
on
the
priest
head
so
that
he
fell
back
stunned
the
company
was
so
filled
with
surprise
and
fright
that
no
one
made
any
movement
to
interfere
keep
off
cried
the
youth
in
a
terrible
voice
as
he
caught
up
a
sharp
knife
and
placed
his
foot
on
the
neck
of
the
friar
who
was
recovering
from
the
shock
of
his
fall
let
him
who
values
his
life
keep
away
the
youth
was
beside
himself
his
whole
body
trembled
and
his
eyes
rolled
threateningly
in
their
sockets
fray
damaso
arose
with
an
effort
but
the
youth
caught
him
by
the
neck
and
shook
him
until
he
again
fell
doubled
over
on
his
knees
señor
ibarra
señor
ibarra
stammered
some
but
no
one
not
even
the
alferez
himself
dared
to
approach
the
gleaming
knife
when
they
considered
the
youth
strength
and
the
condition
of
his
mind
all
seemed
to
be
paralyzed
you
here
you
have
been
silent
now
it
is
my
turn
i
have
tried
to
avoid
this
but
god
brings
me
to
it
let
god
be
the
judge
the
youth
was
breathing
laboriously
but
with
a
hand
of
iron
he
held
down
the
franciscan
who
was
struggling
vainly
to
free
himself
my
heart
beats
tranquilly
my
hand
is
sure
he
began
looking
around
him
first
is
there
one
among
you
one
who
has
not
loved
his
father
who
was
born
in
such
shame
and
humiliation
that
he
hates
his
memory
you
see
you
understand
this
silence
priest
of
a
god
of
peace
with
your
mouth
full
of
sanctity
and
religion
and
your
heart
full
of
evil
you
can
not
know
what
a
father
is
or
you
might
have
thought
of
your
own
in
all
this
crowd
which
you
despise
there
is
not
one
like
you
you
are
condemned
the
persons
surrounding
him
thinking
that
he
was
about
to
commit
murder
made
a
movement
away
he
cried
again
in
a
threatening
voice
what
do
you
fear
that
i
shall
stain
my
hands
with
impure
blood
have
i
not
told
you
that
my
heart
beats
tranquilly
away
from
us
listen
priests
and
judges
you
who
think
yourselves
other
men
and
attribute
to
yourselves
other
rights
my
father
was
an
honorable
man
ask
these
people
here
who
venerate
his
memory
my
father
was
a
good
citizen
and
he
sacrificed
himself
for
me
and
for
the
good
of
his
country
his
house
was
open
and
his
table
was
set
for
the
stranger
and
the
outcast
who
came
to
him
in
distress
he
was
a
christian
who
always
did
good
and
who
never
oppressed
the
unprotected
or
afflicted
those
in
trouble
to
this
man
here
he
opened
his
doors
he
made
him
sit
at
his
table
and
called
him
his
friend
and
how
has
this
man
repaid
him
he
calumniated
him
persecuted
him
raised
up
against
him
all
the
ignorant
by
availing
himself
of
the
sanctity
of
his
position
he
outraged
his
tomb
dishonored
his
memory
and
persecuted
him
even
in
the
sleep
of
death
not
satisfied
with
this
he
persecutes
the
son
now
i
have
fled
from
him
i
have
avoided
his
presence
you
this
morning
heard
him
profane
the
pulpit
pointing
me
out
to
popular
fanaticism
and
i
held
my
peace
now
he
comes
here
to
seek
a
quarrel
with
me
to
your
surprise
i
have
suffered
in
silence
but
he
again
insults
the
most
sacred
memory
that
there
is
for
a
son
you
who
are
here
priests
and
judges
have
you
seen
your
aged
father
wear
himself
out
working
for
you
separating
himself
from
you
for
your
welfare
have
you
seen
him
die
of
sorrow
in
a
prison
sighing
for
your
embrace
seeking
some
one
to
comfort
him
alone
sick
when
you
were
in
a
foreign
land
have
you
afterwards
heard
his
name
dishonored
have
you
found
his
tomb
empty
when
you
went
to
pray
beside
it
no
you
are
silent
you
condemn
him
he
raised
his
hand
but
with
the
swiftness
of
light
a
girlish
form
put
itself
between
them
and
delicate
fingers
restrained
the
avenging
arm
it
was
maria
clara
ibarra
stared
at
her
with
a
look
that
seemed
to
reflect
madness
slowly
his
clenched
fingers
relaxed
letting
fall
the
body
of
the
franciscan
and
the
knife
covering
his
face
he
fled
through
the
crowd
chapter

comments
news
of
the
incident
soon
spread
throughout
the
town
at
first
all
were
incredulous
but
having
to
yield
to
the
fact
they
broke
out
into
exclamations
of
surprise
each
one
according
to
his
moral
lights
made
his
comments
padre
damaso
is
dead
said
some
when
they
picked
him
up
his
face
was
covered
with
blood
and
he
was
breathing
may
he
rest
in
peace
but
he
has
any
more
than
settled
his
debts
exclaimed
a
young
man
look
what
he
did
this
morning
in
the
convento
there
is
any
name
for
it
what
did
he
do
did
he
beat
up
the
coadjutor
again
what
did
he
do
tell
us
about
it
you
saw
that
spanish
mestizo
go
out
through
the
sacristy
in
the
midst
of
the
sermon
yes
we
saw
him
padre
damaso
took
note
of
him
well
after
the
sermon
he
sent
for
the
young
man
and
asked
him
why
he
had
gone
out
do
understand
tagalog
padre
was
the
reply
why
did
you
joke
about
it
saying
that
it
was
greek
yelled
padre
damaso
slapping
the
young
man
in
the
face
the
latter
retorted
and
the
two
came
to
blows
until
they
were
separated
if
that
had
happened
to
me
hissed
a
student
between
his
teeth
i
do
approve
of
the
action
of
the
franciscan
said
another
since
religion
ought
not
to
be
imposed
on
any
one
as
a
punishment
or
a
penance
but
i
am
almost
glad
of
it
for
i
know
that
young
man
i
know
that
he
from
san
pedro
makati
and
that
he
talks
tagalog
well
now
he
wants
to
be
taken
for
a
recent
arrival
from
russia
and
prides
himself
on
appearing
not
to
know
the
language
of
his
fathers
then
god
makes
them
and
they
rush
together
still
we
must
protest
against
such
actions
exclaimed
another
student
to
remain
silent
would
be
to
assent
to
the
abuse
and
what
has
happened
may
be
repeated
with
any
one
of
us
we
going
back
to
the
times
of
nero
you
wrong
replied
another
nero
was
a
great
artist
while
padre
damaso
is
only
a
tiresome
preacher
the
comments
of
the
older
persons
were
of
a
different
kind
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
in
a
hut
outside
the
town
the
gobernadorcillo
was
saying
to
tell
who
was
right
and
who
was
wrong
is
not
an
easy
matter
yet
if
señor
ibarra
had
used
more
prudence
if
padre
damaso
had
used
half
the
prudence
of
señor
ibarra
you
mean
to
say
perhaps
interrupted
don
filipo
the
bad
thing
about
it
is
that
they
exchanged
parts
the
youth
conducted
himself
like
an
old
man
and
the
old
man
like
a
youth
did
you
say
that
no
one
moved
no
one
went
near
to
separate
them
except
capitan
tiago
daughter
asked
capitan
martin
none
of
the
friars
nor
the
alcalde
ahem
worse
and
worse
i
should
like
to
be
in
that
young
man
skin
no
one
will
forgive
him
for
having
been
afraid
of
him
worse
and
worse
ahem
do
you
think
so
asked
capitan
basilio
curiously
i
hope
said
don
filipo
exchanging
a
look
with
the
latter
that
the
people
wo
desert
him
we
must
keep
in
mind
what
his
family
has
done
and
what
he
is
trying
to
do
now
and
if
as
may
happen
the
people
being
intimidated
are
silent
his
friends
but
gentlemen
interrupted
the
gobernadorcillo
what
can
we
do
what
can
the
people
do
happen
what
will
the
friars
are
always
right
they
are
right
because
we
allow
them
to
be
answered
don
filipo
impatiently
putting
double
stress
on
the
italicized
word
let
us
be
right
once
and
then
we
talk
the
gobernadorcillo
scratched
his
head
and
stared
at
the
roof
while
he
replied
in
a
sour
tone
ay
the
heat
of
the
blood
you
do
seem
to
realize
yet
what
country
we
in
you
do
know
your
countrymen
the
friars
are
rich
and
united
while
we
are
divided
and
poor
yes
try
to
defend
yourself
and
you
see
how
the
people
will
leave
you
in
the
lurch
yes
exclaimed
don
filipo
bitterly
that
will
happen
as
long
as
you
think
that
way
as
long
as
fear
and
prudence
are
synonyms
more
attention
is
paid
to
a
possible
evil
than
to
a
necessary
good
at
once
fear
and
not
confidence
presents
itself
each
one
thinks
only
of
himself
no
one
thinks
of
the
rest
and
therefore
we
are
all
weak
well
then
think
of
others
before
yourself
and
you
see
how
leave
you
in
the
lurch
do
you
know
the
proverb
begins
at
home
you
had
better
say
replied
the
exasperated
that
cowardice
begins
in
selfishness
and
ends
in
shame
this
very
day
going
to
hand
in
my
resignation
to
the
alcalde
i
tired
of
passing
for
a
joke
without
being
useful
to
anybody
the
women
had
opinions
of
still
another
kind
sighed
one
woman
of
kindly
expression
the
young
men
are
always
so
if
his
good
mother
were
alive
what
would
she
say
when
i
think
that
the
like
may
happen
to
my
son
who
has
a
violent
temper
i
almost
envy
his
dead
mother
i
should
die
of
grief
well
i
should
replied
another
it
would
cause
me
any
shame
if
such
a
thing
should
happen
to
my
two
sons
what
are
you
saying
capitana
maria
exclaimed
the
first
clasping
her
hands
it
pleases
me
to
see
a
son
defend
the
memory
of
his
parents
capitana
tinay
what
would
you
say
if
some
day
when
you
were
a
widow
you
heard
your
husband
spoken
ill
of
and
your
son
antonio
should
hang
his
head
and
remain
silent
i
would
deny
him
my
blessing
exclaimed
a
third
sister
rufa
but
deny
him
my
blessing
never
interrupted
the
kind
capitana
tinay
a
mother
ought
not
to
say
that
but
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
i
do
know
i
believe
i
die
but
i
should
want
to
see
him
again
but
what
do
you
think
about
it
capitana
maria
after
all
added
sister
rufa
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
a
great
sin
to
place
your
hand
on
a
sacred
person
a
father
memory
is
more
sacred
replied
capitana
maria
no
one
not
even
the
pope
himself
much
less
padre
damaso
may
profane
such
a
holy
memory
that
true
murmured
capitana
tinay
admiring
the
wisdom
of
both
where
did
you
get
such
good
ideas
but
the
excommunication
and
the
condemnation
exclaimed
sister
rufa
what
are
honor
and
a
good
name
in
this
life
if
in
the
other
we
are
damned
everything
passes
away
quickly
but
the
excommunication
to
outrage
a
minister
of
christ
no
one
less
than
the
pope
can
pardon
that
god
who
commands
honor
for
father
and
mother
will
pardon
it
god
will
not
excommunicate
him
and
i
tell
you
that
if
that
young
man
comes
to
my
house
i
will
receive
him
and
talk
with
him
and
if
i
had
a
daughter
i
would
want
him
for
a
he
who
is
a
good
son
will
be
a
good
husband
and
a
good
father
believe
it
sister
rufa
well
i
do
think
so
say
what
you
like
and
even
though
you
may
appear
to
be
right
i
always
rather
believe
the
curate
before
everything
else
i
save
my
soul
what
do
you
say
capitana
tinny
oh
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
you
both
right
the
curate
is
right
but
god
must
also
be
right
i
do
know
i
only
a
foolish
woman
what
i
going
to
do
is
to
tell
my
son
not
to
study
any
more
for
they
say
that
persons
who
know
anything
die
on
the
gallows
my
son
wants
to
go
to
europe
what
are
you
thinking
of
doing
tell
him
to
stay
with
me
why
should
he
know
more
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
we
shall
die
the
learned
and
the
ignorant
alike
must
die
and
the
only
question
is
to
live
in
peace
the
good
old
woman
sighed
and
raised
her
eyes
toward
the
sky
for
my
part
said
capitana
maria
gravely
if
i
were
rich
like
you
i
would
let
my
sons
travel
they
are
young
and
will
some
day
be
men
i
have
only
a
little
while
to
live
we
should
see
one
another
in
the
other
life
so
sons
should
aspire
to
be
more
than
their
fathers
but
at
our
sides
we
only
teach
them
to
be
children
ay
what
rare
thoughts
you
have
exclaimed
the
astonished
capitana
tinay
clasping
her
hands
it
must
be
that
you
did
suffer
in
bearing
your
twin
boys
for
the
very
reason
that
i
did
bear
them
with
suffering
that
i
have
nurtured
and
reared
them
in
spite
of
our
poverty
i
do
not
wish
that
after
the
trouble
they
cost
me
they
be
only
it
seems
to
me
that
you
do
love
your
children
as
god
commands
said
sister
rufa
in
a
rather
severe
tone
pardon
me
every
mother
loves
her
sons
in
her
own
way
one
mother
loves
them
for
her
own
sake
and
another
loves
them
for
their
sake
i
am
one
of
the
latter
for
my
husband
has
so
taught
me
all
your
ideas
capitana
maria
said
sister
rufa
as
if
preaching
are
but
little
religious
become
a
sister
of
the
holy
rosary
or
of
francis
or
of
rita
or
of
st
clara
sister
rufa
when
i
am
a
worthy
sister
of
men
then
i
try
to
be
a
sister
of
the
saints
she
answered
with
a
smile
to
put
an
end
to
this
chapter
of
comments
and
that
the
reader
may
learn
in
passing
what
the
simple
country
folk
thought
of
the
incident
we
will
now
go
to
the
plaza
where
under
the
large
awning
some
rustics
are
conversing
one
of
them
he
who
dreamed
about
doctors
of
medicine
being
an
acquaintance
of
ours
what
i
regret
most
said
he
is
that
the
schoolhouse
wo
be
finished
what
that
asked
the
bystanders
with
interest
my
son
wo
be
a
doctor
but
a
carter
nothing
more
now
there
be
any
school
who
says
there
wo
be
any
school
asked
a
rough
and
robust
countryman
with
wide
cheeks
and
a
narrow
head
i
do
the
white
padres
have
called
don
crisostomo
now
there
wo
be
any
school
all
stood
looking
questioningly
at
each
other
that
was
a
new
term
to
them
and
is
that
a
bad
name
the
rough
countryman
made
bold
to
ask
the
worst
thing
that
one
christian
can
say
to
another
worse
than
and
if
it
were
only
that
i
been
called
those
names
several
times
and
they
did
even
give
me
a
bellyache
well
it
ca
be
worse
than
as
the
alferez
says
the
man
who
was
to
have
a
carter
for
a
son
became
gloomier
while
the
other
scratched
his
head
in
thought
then
it
must
be
like
the
that
the
alferez
old
woman
says
worse
than
that
is
to
spit
on
the
host
well
it
worse
than
to
spit
on
the
host
on
good
friday
was
the
grave
reply
you
remember
the
word
which
when
applied
to
a
man
is
enough
to
have
the
take
him
into
exile
or
put
him
in
jail
well
is
much
worse
according
to
what
the
telegrapher
and
the
directorcillo
said
said
by
a
christian
a
curate
or
a
spaniard
to
another
christian
like
us
is
a
with
for
if
they
ever
call
you
a
then
you
better
get
yourself
shriven
and
pay
your
debts
since
nothing
remains
for
you
but
to
be
hanged
you
know
whether
the
telegrapher
and
the
directorcillo
ought
to
be
informed
one
talks
with
wires
and
the
other
knows
spanish
and
works
only
with
a
pen
all
were
appalled
may
they
force
me
to
wear
shoes
and
in
all
my
life
to
drink
nothing
but
that
vile
stuff
they
call
beer
if
i
ever
let
myself
be
called
swore
the
countryman
clenching
his
fists
what
rich
as
don
crisostomo
is
knowing
spanish
as
he
does
and
able
to
eat
fast
with
a
knife
and
spoon
i
laugh
at
five
curates
the
next
i
catch
stealing
my
chickens
i
going
to
call
then
i
go
to
confession
at
once
murmured
one
of
the
rustics
in
a
low
voice
as
he
withdrew
from
the
group
chapter
xxxvi
the
first
cloud
in
capitan
tiago
house
reigned
no
less
disorder
than
in
the
imagination
maria
clara
did
nothing
but
weep
and
would
not
listen
to
the
consoling
words
of
her
aunt
and
of
andeng
her
her
father
had
forbidden
her
to
speak
to
ibarra
until
the
priests
should
absolve
him
from
the
excommunication
capitan
tiago
himself
in
the
midst
of
his
preparations
for
receiving
the
properly
had
been
summoned
to
the
convento
do

said
aunt
isabel
as
she
polished
the
bright
plates
of
the
mirrors
with
a
piece
of
chamois
they
withdraw
the
excommunication
they
write
now
to
the
pope
and
we
make
a
big
padre
damaso
only
fainted
he
not
dead

whispered
andeng
i
manage
it
so
that
you
may
talk
with
him
what
are
confessionals
for
if
not
that
we
may
sin
everything
is
forgiven
by
telling
it
to
the
curate
at
length
capitan
tiago
returned
they
sought
in
his
face
the
answer
to
many
questions
and
it
announced
discouragement
the
poor
fellow
was
perspiring
he
rubbed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
but
was
unable
to
say
a
single
word
what
has
happened
santiago
asked
aunt
isabel
anxiously
he
answered
by
sighing
and
wiping
away
a
tear
for
god
sake
speak
what
has
happened
just
what
i
feared
he
broke
out
at
last
half
in
tears
all
is
lost
padre
damaso
has
ordered
me
to
break
the
engagement
otherwise
he
will
damn
me
in
this
life
and
in
the
next
all
of
them
told
me
the
same
even
padre
sibyla
i
must
close
the
doors
of
my
house
against
him
and
i
owe
him
over
fifty
thousand
pesos
i
told
the
padres
this
but
they
refused
to
take
any
notice
of
it
do
you
prefer
to
lose
they
asked
me
thousand
pesos
or
your
life
and
your
soul
ay
anthony
if
i
had
only
known
if
i
had
only
known
do
cry
daughter
he
went
on
turning
to
the
sobbing
girl
you
not
like
your
mother
who
never
cried
except
just
before
you
were
born
padre
damaso
told
me
that
a
relative
of
his
has
just
arrived
from
spain
and
you
are
to
marry
him
maria
clara
covered
her
ears
while
aunt
isabel
screamed
santiago
are
you
crazy
to
talk
to
her
of
another
sweetheart
now
do
you
think
that
your
daughter
changes
sweethearts
as
she
does
her
camisa
that
just
the
way
i
felt
isabel
don
crisostomo
is
rich
while
the
spaniards
marry
only
for
love
of
money
but
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
they
threatened
me
with
another
excommunication
they
say
that
not
only
my
soul
but
also
my
body
is
in
great
danger
my
body
do
you
hear
my
body
but
you
only
making
your
daughter
more
disconsolate
is
the
archbishop
your
friend
why
do
you
write
to
him
the
archbishop
is
also
a
friar
the
archbishop
does
only
what
the
friars
tell
him
to
do
but
maria
do
cry
the
is
coming
he
want
to
see
you
and
your
eyes
are
all
red
ay
i
was
thinking
to
spend
a
happy
evening
without
this
misfortune
i
should
be
the
happiest
of
men
every
one
would
envy
me
be
calm
my
child
i
more
unfortunate
than
you
and
i
not
crying
you
can
have
another
and
better
husband
while
i
i
lost
fifty
thousand
pesos
ay
virgin
of
antipolo
if
tonight
i
may
only
have
luck
salvos
the
sound
of
carriage
wheels
the
galloping
of
horses
and
a
band
playing
the
royal
march
announced
the
arrival
of
his
excellency
the
of
the
philippines
maria
clara
ran
to
hide
herself
in
her
chamber
poor
child
rough
hands
that
knew
not
its
delicate
chords
were
playing
with
her
heart
while
the
house
became
filled
with
people
and
heavy
steps
commanding
voices
and
the
clank
of
sabers
and
spurs
resounded
on
all
sides
the
afflicted
maiden
reclined
before
a
picture
of
the
virgin
represented
in
that
sorrowful
loneliness
perceived
only
by
delaroche
as
if
he
had
surprised
her
returning
from
the
sepulcher
of
her
son
but
maria
clara
was
not
thinking
of
that
mother
sorrow
she
was
thinking
of
her
own
with
her
head
hanging
down
over
her
breast
and
her
hands
resting
on
the
floor
she
made
the
picture
of
a
lily
bent
by
the
storm
a
future
dreamed
of
and
cherished
for
years
whose
illusions
born
in
infancy
and
grown
strong
throughout
youth
had
given
form
to
the
very
fibers
of
her
being
to
be
wiped
away
now
from
her
mind
and
heart
by
a
single
word
it
was
enough
to
stop
the
beating
of
one
and
to
deprive
the
other
of
reason
maria
clara
was
a
loving
daughter
as
well
as
a
good
and
pious
christian
so
it
was
not
the
excommunication
alone
that
terrified
her
but
the
command
and
the
ominous
calmness
of
her
father
demanding
the
sacrifice
of
her
love
now
she
felt
the
whole
force
of
that
affection
which
until
this
moment
she
had
hardly
suspected
it
had
been
like
a
river
gliding
along
peacefully
with
its
banks
carpeted
by
fragrant
flowers
and
its
bed
covered
with
fine
sand
so
that
the
wind
hardly
ruffled
its
current
as
it
moved
along
seeming
hardly
to
flow
at
all
but
suddenly
its
bed
becomes
narrower
sharp
stones
block
the
way
hoary
logs
fall
across
it
forming
a
barrier
then
the
stream
rises
and
roars
with
its
waves
boiling
and
scattering
clouds
of
foam
it
beats
against
the
rocks
and
rushes
into
the
abyss
she
wanted
to
pray
but
who
in
despair
can
pray
prayers
are
for
the
hours
of
hope
and
when
in
the
absence
of
this
we
turn
to
god
it
is
only
with
complaints
my
god
cried
her
heart
why
dost
thou
thus
cut
a
man
off
why
dost
thou
deny
him
the
love
of
others
thou
dost
not
deny
him
thy
sunlight
and
thy
air
nor
hide
from
him
the
sight
of
thy
heaven
why
then
deny
him
love
for
without
a
sight
of
the
sky
without
air
or
sunlight
one
can
live
but
without
love
never
would
these
cries
unheard
by
men
reach
the
throne
of
god
or
be
heard
by
the
mother
of
the
distressed
the
poor
maiden
who
had
never
known
a
mother
dared
to
confide
these
sorrows
of
an
earthly
love
to
that
pure
heart
that
knew
only
the
love
of
daughter
and
of
mother
in
her
despair
she
turned
to
that
deified
image
of
womanhood
the
most
beautiful
idealization
of
the
most
ideal
of
all
creatures
to
that
poetical
creation
of
christianity
who
unites
in
herself
the
two
most
beautiful
phases
of
womanhood
without
its
sorrows
those
of
virgin
and
mother
to
her
whom
we
call
mary
mother
mother
she
moaned
aunt
isabel
came
to
tear
her
away
from
her
sorrow
since
she
was
being
asked
for
by
some
friends
and
by
the
who
wished
to
talk
with
her
aunt
tell
them
that
i
ill
begged
the
frightened
girl
going
to
make
me
play
on
the
piano
and
sing
your
father
has
promised
are
you
going
to
put
your
father
in
a
bad
light
maria
clara
rose
looked
at
her
aunt
and
threw
back
her
shapely
arms
murmuring
oh
if
i
only
had
but
without
concluding
the
phrase
she
began
to
make
herself
ready
for
presentation
chapter
xxxvii
his
excellency
i
want
to
talk
with
that
young
man
said
his
excellency
to
an
aide
he
has
aroused
all
my
interest
they
have
already
gone
to
look
for
him
general
but
here
is
a
young
man
from
manila
who
insists
on
being
introduced
we
told
him
that
your
excellency
had
no
time
for
interviews
that
you
had
not
come
to
give
audiences
but
to
see
the
town
and
the
procession
and
he
answered
that
your
excellency
always
has
time
to
dispense
justice
his
excellency
turned
to
the
alcalde
in
wonder
if
i
am
not
mistaken
said
the
latter
with
a
slight
bow
he
is
the
young
man
who
this
morning
had
a
quarrel
with
padre
damaso
over
the
sermon
still
another
has
this
friar
set
himself
to
stir
up
the
whole
province
or
does
he
think
that
he
governs
here
show
the
young
man
in
his
excellency
paced
nervously
from
one
end
of
the
sala
to
the
other
in
the
hall
were
gathered
various
spaniards
mingled
with
soldiers
and
officials
of
san
diego
and
neighboring
towns
standing
in
groups
conversing
or
disputing
there
were
also
to
be
seen
all
the
friars
with
the
exception
of
padre
damaso
and
they
wanted
to
go
in
to
pay
their
respects
to
his
excellency
his
excellency
the
begs
your
reverences
to
wait
a
moment
said
the
aide
come
in
young
man
the
manilan
who
had
confounded
greek
with
tagalog
entered
the
room
pale
and
trembling
all
were
filled
with
surprise
surely
his
excellency
must
be
greatly
irritated
to
dare
to
make
the
friars
wait
padre
sibyla
remarked
i
have
anything
to
say
to
him
i
wasting
my
time
here
i
say
the
same
added
an
augustinian
shall
we
go
would
it
be
better
that
we
find
out
how
he
stands
asked
padre
salvi
we
should
avoid
a
scandal
and
should
be
able
to
remind
him
of
his
duties
toward
religion
your
reverences
may
enter
if
you
so
desire
said
the
aide
as
he
ushered
out
the
youth
who
did
not
understand
greek
and
whose
countenance
was
now
beaming
with
satisfaction
fray
sibyla
entered
first
padre
salvi
padre
martin
and
the
other
priests
following
they
all
made
respectful
bows
with
the
exception
of
padre
sibyla
who
even
in
bending
preserved
a
certain
air
of
superiority
padre
salvi
on
the
other
hand
almost
doubled
himself
over
the
girdle
which
of
your
reverences
is
padre
damaso
asked
the
without
any
preliminary
greeting
neither
asking
them
to
be
seated
nor
inquiring
about
their
health
nor
addressing
them
with
the
flattering
speeches
to
which
such
important
personages
are
accustomed
padre
damaso
is
not
here
among
us
sir
replied
fray
sibyla
in
the
same
dry
tone
as
that
used
by
his
excellency
your
excellency
servant
is
in
bed
sick
added
padre
salvi
humbly
after
having
the
pleasure
of
welcoming
you
and
of
informing
ourselves
concerning
your
excellency
health
as
is
the
duty
of
all
good
subjects
of
the
king
and
of
every
person
of
culture
we
have
come
in
the
name
of
the
respected
servant
of
your
excellency
who
has
had
the
misfortune
oh
interrupted
the
twirling
a
chair
about
on
one
leg
and
smiling
nervously
if
all
the
servants
of
my
excellency
were
like
his
reverence
padre
damaso
i
should
prefer
myself
to
serve
my
excellency
the
reverend
gentlemen
who
were
standing
up
physically
did
so
mentally
at
this
interruption
wo
your
reverences
be
seated
he
added
after
a
brief
pause
moderating
his
tone
a
little
capitan
tiago
here
appeared
in
full
dress
walking
on
tiptoe
and
leading
by
the
hand
maria
clara
who
entered
timidly
and
with
hesitation
still
she
bowed
gracefully
and
ceremoniously
is
this
young
lady
your
daughter
asked
the
in
surprise
and
your
excellency
general
answered
capitan
tiago
seriously
the
alcalde
and
the
aides
opened
their
eyes
wide
but
his
excellency
lost
none
of
his
gravity
as
he
took
the
girl
hand
and
said
affably
happy
are
the
fathers
who
have
daughters
like
you
señorita
i
have
heard
you
spoken
of
with
respect
and
admiration
and
have
wanted
to
see
you
and
thank
you
for
your
beautiful
action
of
this
afternoon
i
am
informed
of
and
when
i
make
my
report
to
his
government
i
shall
not
forget
your
noble
conduct
meanwhile
permit
me
to
thank
you
in
the
name
of
his
majesty
the
king
whom
i
represent
here
and
who
loves
and
in
his
loyal
subjects
and
for
myself
a
father
who
has
daughters
of
your
age
and
to
propose
a
reward
for
you
sir
answered
the
trembling
maria
clara
his
excellency
guessed
what
she
wanted
to
say
and
so
continued
it
is
well
señorita
that
you
are
at
peace
with
your
conscience
and
content
with
the
good
opinion
of
your
with
the
faith
which
is
its
own
best
reward
and
beyond
which
we
should
not
aspire
but
you
must
not
deprive
me
of
an
opportunity
to
show
that
if
justice
knows
how
to
punish
she
also
knows
how
to
reward
and
that
she
is
not
always
the
italicized
words
were
all
spoken
in
a
loud
and
significant
tone
señor
don
juan
crisostomo
ibarra
awaits
the
orders
of
your
excellency
announced
the
aide
in
a
loud
voice
maria
clara
shuddered
ah
exclaimed
the
allow
me
señorita
to
express
my
desire
to
see
you
again
before
leaving
the
town
as
i
still
have
some
very
important
things
to
say
to
you
señor
alcalde
you
will
accompany
me
during
the
walk
which
i
wish
to
take
after
the
conference
that
i
will
hold
alone
with
señor
ibarra
your
excellency
will
permit
us
to
inform
you
began
padre
salvi
humbly
that
señor
ibarra
is
excommunicated
his
excellency
cut
short
this
speech
saying
i
am
happy
that
i
have
only
to
regret
the
condition
of
padre
damaso
for
whom
i
desire
a
recovery
since
at
his
age
voyage
to
on
account
of
his
health
may
not
be
very
agreeable
but
that
depends
on
him
meanwhile
may
god
preserve
the
health
of
your
reverences
and
so
much
depends
on
him
murmured
padre
salvi
as
they
retired
we
see
who
makes
that
voyage
soonest
remarked
another
franciscan
i
shall
leave
at
once
declared
the
indignant
padre
sibyla
and
we
shall
go
back
to
our
province
said
the
augustinians
neither
the
dominican
nor
the
augustinians
could
endure
the
thought
that
they
had
been
so
coldly
received
on
a
franciscan
account
in
the
hall
they
met
ibarra
their
amphitryon
of
a
few
hours
before
but
no
greetings
were
exchanged
only
looks
that
said
many
things
but
when
the
friars
had
withdrawn
the
alcalde
greeted
him
familiarly
although
the
entrance
of
the
aide
looking
for
the
young
man
left
no
time
for
conversation
in
the
doorway
he
met
maria
clara
their
looks
also
said
many
things
but
quite
different
from
what
the
eyes
had
expressed
ibarra
was
dressed
in
deep
mourning
but
presented
himself
serenely
and
made
a
profound
bow
even
though
the
visit
of
the
friars
had
not
appeared
to
him
to
be
a
good
augury
the
advanced
toward
him
several
steps
i
take
pleasure
señor
ibarra
in
shaking
your
hand
permit
me
to
receive
you
in
all
confidence
his
excellency
examined
the
youth
with
marked
satisfaction
sir
such
kindness
your
surprise
offends
me
signifying
as
it
does
that
you
had
not
expected
to
be
well
received
that
is
casting
a
doubt
on
my
sense
of
justice
a
cordial
reception
sir
for
an
insignificant
subject
of
his
majesty
like
myself
is
not
justice
but
a
favor
good
good
exclaimed
his
excellency
seating
himself
and
waving
ibarra
to
a
chair
let
us
enjoy
a
brief
period
of
frankness
i
am
very
well
satisfied
with
your
conduct
and
have
already
recommended
you
to
his
majesty
for
a
decoration
on
account
of
your
philanthropic
idea
of
erecting
a
schoolhouse
if
you
had
let
me
know
i
would
have
attended
the
ceremony
with
pleasure
and
perhaps
might
have
prevented
a
disagreeable
incident
it
seemed
to
me
such
a
small
matter
answered
the
youth
that
i
did
not
think
it
worth
while
troubling
your
excellency
with
it
in
the
midst
of
your
numerous
cares
besides
my
duty
was
to
apply
first
to
the
chief
authority
of
my
province
his
excellency
nodded
with
a
satisfied
air
and
went
on
in
an
even
more
familiar
tone
in
regard
to
the
trouble
you
had
with
padre
damaso
do
hold
any
fear
or
rancor
for
they
wo
touch
a
hair
of
your
head
while
i
govern
the
islands
as
for
the
excommunication
i
speak
to
the
archbishop
since
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
adjust
ourselves
to
circumstances
here
we
ca
laugh
at
such
things
in
public
as
we
can
in
the
peninsula
and
in
enlightened
europe
nevertheless
be
more
prudent
in
the
future
you
have
placed
yourself
in
opposition
to
the
religious
orders
who
must
be
respected
on
account
of
their
influence
and
their
wealth
but
i
will
protect
you
for
i
like
good
sons
i
like
to
see
them
honor
the
memory
of
their
fathers
i
loved
mine
and
as
god
lives
i
do
know
what
i
would
have
done
in
your
place
then
changing
the
subject
of
conversation
quickly
he
asked
told
that
you
have
just
returned
from
europe
were
you
in
madrid
yes
sir
several
months
perhaps
you
heard
my
family
spoken
of
your
excellency
had
just
left
when
i
had
the
honor
of
being
introduced
to
your
family
how
is
it
then
that
you
came
without
bringing
any
recommendations
to
me
sir
replied
ibarra
with
a
bow
because
i
did
not
come
direct
from
spain
and
because
i
have
heard
your
excellency
so
well
spoken
of
that
i
thought
a
letter
of
recommendation
might
not
only
be
valueless
but
even
offensive
all
filipinos
are
recommended
to
you
a
smile
played
about
the
old
soldier
lips
and
he
replied
slowly
as
though
measuring
and
weighing
his
words
you
flatter
me
by
thinking
so
and
so
it
ought
to
be
nevertheless
young
man
you
must
know
what
burdens
weigh
upon
our
shoulders
here
in
the
philippines
here
we
old
soldiers
have
to
do
and
to
be
everything
king
minister
of
state
of
war
of
justice
of
finance
of
agriculture
and
of
all
the
rest
the
worst
part
of
it
too
is
that
in
every
matter
we
have
to
consult
the
distant
mother
country
which
accepts
or
rejects
our
proposals
according
to
circumstances
there
and
at
times
blindly
as
we
spaniards
say
who
attempts
many
things
succeeds
in
none
besides
we
generally
come
here
knowing
little
about
the
country
and
leave
it
when
we
begin
to
get
acquainted
with
it
with
you
i
can
be
frank
for
it
would
be
useless
to
try
to
be
otherwise
even
in
spain
where
each
department
has
its
own
minister
born
and
reared
in
the
locality
where
there
are
a
press
and
a
public
opinion
where
the
opposition
frankly
opens
the
eyes
of
the
government
and
keeps
it
informed
everything
moves
along
imperfectly
and
defectively
thus
it
is
a
miracle
that
here
things
are
not
completely
topsyturvy
in
the
lack
of
these
safeguards
and
having
to
live
and
work
under
the
shadow
of
a
most
powerful
opposition
good
intentions
are
not
lacking
to
us
the
governing
powers
but
we
find
ourselves
obliged
to
avail
ourselves
of
the
eyes
and
arms
of
others
whom
ordinarily
we
do
not
know
and
who
perhaps
instead
of
serving
their
country
serve
only
their
own
private
interests
this
is
not
our
fault
but
the
fault
of
circumstances
the
friars
aid
us
not
a
little
in
getting
along
but
they
are
not
sufficient
you
have
aroused
my
interest
and
it
is
my
desire
that
the
imperfections
of
our
present
system
of
government
be
of
no
hindrance
to
you
i
can
not
look
after
everybody
nor
can
everybody
come
to
me
can
i
be
of
service
to
you
in
any
way
have
you
no
request
to
make
ibarra
reflected
a
moment
before
he
answered
sir
my
dearest
wish
is
the
happiness
of
my
country
a
happiness
which
i
desire
to
see
owed
to
the
mother
country
and
to
the
efforts
of
my
the
two
united
by
the
eternal
bonds
of
common
aspirations
and
common
interests
what
i
would
request
can
only
be
given
by
the
government
after
years
of
unceasing
toil
and
after
the
introduction
of
definite
reforms
his
excellency
gazed
at
him
for
a
few
seconds
with
a
searching
look
which
ibarra
sustained
with
naturalness
you
are
the
first
man
that
i
talked
to
in
this
country
he
finally
exclaimed
extending
his
hand
your
excellency
has
seen
only
those
who
drag
themselves
about
in
the
city
you
have
not
visited
the
slandered
huts
of
our
towns
or
your
excellency
would
have
been
able
to
see
real
men
if
to
be
a
man
it
is
sufficient
to
have
a
generous
heart
and
simple
customs
the
rose
and
began
to
walk
back
and
forth
in
the
room
señor
ibarra
he
exclaimed
pausing
suddenly
and
the
young
man
also
rose
perhaps
within
a
month
i
shall
leave
your
education
and
your
mode
of
thinking
are
not
for
this
country
sell
what
you
have
pack
your
trunk
and
come
with
me
to
europe
the
climate
there
will
be
more
agreeable
to
you
i
shall
always
while
i
live
preserve
the
memory
of
your
kindness
replied
ibarra
with
emotion
but
i
must
remain
in
this
country
where
my
fathers
have
lived
where
they
have
died
you
might
say
with
more
exactness
believe
me
perhaps
i
know
your
country
better
than
you
yourself
do
ah
now
i
remember
he
exclaimed
with
a
change
of
tone
you
are
going
to
marry
an
adorable
young
woman
and
i
detaining
you
here
go
go
to
her
and
that
you
may
have
greater
freedom
send
her
father
to
me
this
with
a
smile
do
forget
though
that
i
want
you
to
accompany
me
in
my
walk
ibarra
bowed
and
withdrew
his
excellency
then
called
to
his
aide
i
satisfied
he
said
slapping
the
latter
lightly
on
the
shoulder
today
i
seen
for
the
first
time
how
it
is
possible
for
one
to
be
a
good
spaniard
without
ceasing
to
be
a
good
filipino
and
to
love
his
country
today
i
showed
their
reverences
that
we
are
not
all
puppets
of
theirs
this
young
man
gave
me
the
opportunity
and
i
shall
soon
have
settled
all
my
accounts
with
the
friars
it
a
pity
that
some
day
or
other
this
young
man
but
call
the
alcalde
the
alcalde
presented
himself
immediately
as
he
entered
the
said
to
him
señor
alcalde
in
order
to
avoid
any
repetition
of
such
as
you
this
afternoon
scenes
that
i
regret
as
they
the
of
the
government
and
of
all
good
spaniards
allow
me
to
recommend
to
your
care
señor
ibarra
so
that
you
may
afford
him
means
for
carrying
out
his
patriotic
intentions
and
also
that
in
the
future
you
prevent
his
being
molested
by
persons
of
any
class
whatsoever
under
any
pretext
at
all
the
alcalde
understood
the
reprimand
and
bowed
to
conceal
his
confusion
have
the
same
order
communicated
to
the
alferez
who
commands
in
the
district
here
also
investigate
whether
that
gentleman
has
affairs
of
his
own
that
are
not
sanctioned
by
the
regulations
i
heard
more
than
one
complaint
in
regard
to
that
capitan
tiago
presented
himself
stiff
and
formal
don
santiago
said
his
excellency
in
an
affable
tone
a
little
while
ago
i
felicitated
you
on
the
happiness
of
having
a
daughter
such
as
the
señorita
de
los
santos
now
let
me
congratulate
you
on
your
future
the
most
virtuous
of
daughters
is
certainly
worthy
of
the
best
citizen
of
the
philippines
is
it
permitted
to
know
when
the
wedding
will
occur
sir
stammered
capitan
tiago
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
come
now
i
see
that
there
is
nothing
definitely
arranged
if
persons
are
lacking
to
stand
up
with
them
i
shall
take
the
greatest
pleasure
in
being
one
of
them
that
for
the
purpose
of
ridding
myself
of
the
feeling
of
disgust
which
the
many
weddings
i
heretofore
taken
part
in
have
given
me
he
added
turning
to
the
alcalde
yes
sir
answered
capitan
tiago
with
a
smile
that
would
move
to
pity
ibarra
almost
ran
in
search
of
maria
clara
he
had
so
many
things
to
tell
her
hearing
merry
voices
in
one
of
the
rooms
he
knocked
lightly
on
the
door
who
there
asked
the
voice
of
maria
clara
i
the
voices
became
hushed
and
the
door
did
not
open
it
i
may
i
come
in
called
the
young
man
his
heart
beating
violently
the
silence
continued
then
light
footsteps
approached
the
door
and
the
merry
voice
of
sinang
murmured
through
the
keyhole
crisostomo
going
to
the
theater
tonight
write
what
you
have
to
say
to
maria
the
footsteps
retreated
again
as
rapidly
as
they
approached
what
does
this
mean
murmured
ibarra
thoughtfully
as
he
retired
slowly
from
the
door
chapter
xxxviii
the
procession
at
nightfall
when
all
the
lanterns
in
the
windows
had
been
lighted
for
the
fourth
time
the
procession
started
amid
the
ringing
of
bells
and
the
usual
explosions
of
bombs
the
who
had
gone
out
on
foot
in
company
with
his
two
aides
capitan
tiago
the
alcalde
the
alferez
and
ibarra
preceded
by
and
officials
who
opened
the
way
and
cleared
the
street
was
invited
to
review
the
procession
from
the
house
of
the
gobernadorcillo
in
front
of
which
a
platform
had
been
erected
where
a
would
be
recited
in
honor
of
the
blessed
patron
ibarra
would
gladly
have
renounced
the
pleasure
of
hearing
this
poetical
composition
preferring
to
watch
the
procession
from
capitan
tiago
house
where
maria
clara
had
remained
with
some
of
her
friends
but
his
excellency
wished
to
hear
the
so
he
had
no
recourse
but
to
console
himself
with
the
prospect
of
seeing
her
at
the
theater
the
procession
was
headed
by
the
silver
candelabra
borne
by
three
begloved
sacristans
behind
whom
came
the
school
children
in
charge
of
their
teacher
then
boys
with
paper
lanterns
of
varied
shapes
and
colors
placed
on
the
ends
of
bamboo
poles
of
greater
or
less
length
and
decorated
according
to
the
caprice
of
each
boy
since
this
illumination
was
furnished
by
the
children
of
the
barrios
who
gladly
performed
this
service
imposed
by
the
sa
each
one
designing
and
fashioning
his
own
lantern
adorning
it
as
his
fancy
prompted
and
his
finances
permitted
with
a
greater
or
less
number
of
frills
and
little
streamers
and
lighting
it
with
a
piece
of
candle
if
he
had
a
friend
or
relative
who
was
a
sacristan
or
if
he
could
buy
one
of
the
small
red
tapers
such
as
the
chinese
burn
before
their
altars
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
came
and
went
alguazils
guardians
of
justice
to
take
care
that
the
lines
were
not
broken
and
the
people
did
not
crowd
together
for
this
purpose
they
availed
themselves
of
their
rods
with
blows
from
which
administered
opportunely
and
with
sufficient
force
they
endeavored
to
add
to
the
glory
and
brilliance
of
the
procession
all
for
the
edification
of
souls
and
the
splendor
of
religious
show
at
the
same
time
that
the
alguazils
were
thus
distributing
free
their
sanctifying
blows
other
persons
to
console
the
recipients
distributed
candles
and
tapers
of
different
sizes
also
free
señor
alcalde
said
ibarra
in
a
low
voice
do
they
administer
those
blows
as
a
punishment
for
sin
or
simply
because
they
like
to
do
so
you
right
señor
ibarra
answered
the
overhearing
the
question
this
barbarous
sight
is
a
wonder
to
all
who
come
here
from
other
countries
it
ought
to
be
forbidden
without
any
apparent
reason
the
first
saint
that
appeared
was
john
the
baptist
on
looking
at
him
it
might
have
been
said
that
the
fame
of
our
savior
cousin
did
not
amount
to
much
among
the
people
for
while
it
is
true
that
he
had
the
feet
and
legs
of
a
maiden
and
the
face
of
an
anchorite
yet
he
was
placed
on
an
old
wooden
and
was
hidden
by
a
crowd
of
children
who
armed
with
candles
and
unlighted
lanterns
were
engaging
in
mock
fights
unfortunate
saint
muttered
the
sage
tasio
who
was
watching
the
procession
from
the
street
it
avails
you
nothing
to
have
been
the
forerunner
of
the
good
tidings
or
that
jesus
bowed
before
you
your
great
faith
and
your
austerity
avail
you
nothing
nor
the
fact
that
you
died
for
the
truth
and
your
convictions
all
of
which
men
forget
when
they
consider
nothing
more
than
their
own
merits
it
avails
more
to
preach
badly
in
the
churches
than
to
be
the
eloquent
voice
crying
in
the
desert
this
is
what
the
philippines
teaches
you
if
you
had
eaten
turkey
instead
of
locusts
and
had
worn
garments
of
silk
rather
than
hides
if
you
had
joined
a
corporation
but
the
old
man
suspended
his
apostrophe
at
the
approach
of
francis
did
i
say
so
he
then
went
on
smiling
sarcastically
this
one
rides
on
a
ear
and
good
heavens
what
a
car
how
many
lights
and
how
many
glass
lanterns
never
did
i
see
you
surrounded
by
so
many
luminaries
giovanni
bernardone
and
what
music
other
tunes
were
heard
by
your
followers
after
your
death
but
venerable
and
humble
founder
if
you
were
to
come
back
to
life
now
you
would
see
only
degenerate
eliases
of
cortona
and
if
your
followers
should
recognize
you
they
would
put
you
in
jail
and
perhaps
you
would
share
the
fate
of
cesareus
of
spyre
after
the
music
came
a
banner
on
which
was
pictured
the
same
saint
but
with
seven
wings
carried
by
the
tertiary
brethren
dressed
in
habits
and
praying
in
high
plaintive
voices
rather
inexplicably
next
came
mary
magdalene
a
beautiful
image
with
abundant
hair
wearing
a
pañuelo
of
embroidered
piña
held
by
fingers
covered
with
rings
and
a
silk
gown
decorated
with
gilt
spangles
lights
and
incense
surrounded
her
while
her
glass
tears
reflected
the
colors
of
the
bengal
lights
which
while
giving
a
fantastic
appearance
to
the
procession
also
made
the
saintly
sinner
weep
now
green
now
red
now
blue
tears
the
houses
did
not
begin
to
light
up
until
francis
was
passing
john
the
baptist
did
not
enjoy
this
honor
and
passed
hastily
by
as
if
ashamed
to
be
the
only
one
dressed
in
hides
in
such
a
crowd
of
folk
covered
with
gold
and
jewels
there
goes
our
saint
exclaimed
the
daughter
of
the
gobernadorcillo
to
her
visitors
i
lent
him
all
my
rings
but
that
in
order
to
get
to
heaven
the
stopped
around
the
platform
to
listen
to
the
and
the
blessed
saints
did
the
same
either
they
or
their
bearers
wished
to
hear
the
verses
those
who
were
carrying
john
tired
of
waiting
squatted
down
on
their
heels
and
agreed
to
set
him
on
the
ground
the
alguazil
may
scold
objected
one
of
them
huh
in
the
sacristy
they
leave
him
in
a
corner
among
the
cobwebs
so
john
once
on
the
ground
became
one
of
the
townsfolk
as
the
magdalene
set
out
the
women
joined
the
procession
only
that
instead
of
beginning
with
the
children
as
among
the
men
the
old
women
came
first
and
the
girls
filled
up
the
lines
to
the
car
of
the
virgin
behind
which
came
the
curate
under
his
canopy
this
practise
they
had
from
padre
damaso
who
said
to
the
virgin
the
maidens
and
not
the
old
women
are
pleasing
this
statement
had
caused
wry
faces
on
the
part
of
many
saintly
old
ladies
but
the
virgin
did
not
change
her
tastes
san
diego
followed
the
magdalene
but
did
not
seem
to
be
rejoicing
over
this
fact
since
he
moved
along
as
repentantly
as
he
had
in
the
morning
when
he
followed
francis
his
float
was
drawn
by
six
tertiary
sisters
whether
because
of
some
vow
or
on
account
of
some
sickness
the
fact
is
that
they
dragged
him
along
and
with
zeal
san
diego
stopped
in
front
of
the
platform
and
waited
to
be
saluted
but
it
was
necessary
to
wait
for
the
float
of
the
virgin
which
was
preceded
by
persons
dressed
like
phantoms
who
frightened
the
little
children
so
that
there
were
heard
the
cries
and
screams
of
terrified
babies
yet
in
the
midst
of
that
dark
mass
of
gowns
hoods
girdles
and
nuns
veils
from
which
arose
a
monotonous
and
snuffling
prayer
there
were
to
be
seen
like
white
jasmines
or
fresh
sampaguitas
among
old
rags
twelve
girls
dressed
in
white
crowned
with
flowers
their
hair
curled
and
flashing
from
their
eyes
glances
as
bright
as
their
necklaces
like
little
genii
of
light
who
were
prisoners
of
specters
they
moved
along
holding
to
the
wide
blue
ribbons
tied
to
the
car
and
suggesting
the
doves
that
draw
the
car
of
spring
now
all
the
images
were
in
attitudes
of
attention
crowded
one
against
the
other
to
listen
to
the
verses
everybody
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
curtain
until
at
length
a
sigh
of
admiration
escaped
from
the
lips
of
all
deservedly
so
too
for
it
was
a
boy
with
wings
sash
belt
and
plumed
hat
it
the
alcalde
cried
some
one
but
this
prodigy
of
creation
began
to
recite
a
poem
like
himself
and
took
no
offense
at
the
comparison
but
why
record
here
what
he
said
in
latin
tagalog
and
spanish
all
in
verse
this
poor
victim
of
the
gobernadorcillo
our
readers
have
enjoyed
padre
damaso
sermon
of
the
morning
and
we
do
not
wish
to
spoil
them
by
too
many
wonders
besides
the
franciscan
might
feel
hard
toward
us
if
we
were
to
put
forward
a
competitor
and
this
is
far
from
being
the
desire
of
such
peaceful
folk
as
we
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
afterwards
the
procession
moved
on
john
proceeding
along
his
vale
of
tears
when
the
virgin
passed
the
house
of
capitan
tiago
a
heavenly
song
greeted
her
with
the
words
of
the
archangel
it
was
a
voice
tender
melodious
pleading
sighing
out
the
of
gounod
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
piano
that
prayed
with
it
the
music
of
the
procession
became
hushed
the
praying
ceased
and
even
padre
salvi
himself
paused
the
voice
trembled
and
became
plaintive
expressing
more
than
a
salutation
rather
a
prayer
and
a
protest
terror
and
melancholy
settled
down
upon
ibarra
heart
as
he
listened
to
the
voice
from
the
window
where
he
stood
he
comprehended
what
that
suffering
soul
was
expressing
in
a
song
and
yet
feared
to
ask
himself
the
cause
of
such
sorrow
gloomy
and
thoughtful
he
turned
to
the
you
will
join
me
at
the
table
the
latter
said
to
him
there
talk
about
those
boys
who
disappeared
could
i
be
the
cause
murmured
the
young
man
staring
without
seeing
the
whom
he
was
following
mechanically
chapter
xxxix
doña
consolacion
why
were
the
windows
closed
in
the
house
of
the
alferez
where
were
the
masculine
features
and
the
flannel
camisa
of
the
medusa
or
muse
of
the
civil
guard
while
the
procession
was
passing
had
doña
consolacion
realized
how
disagreeable
were
her
forehead
seamed
with
thick
veins
that
appeared
to
conduct
not
blood
but
vinegar
and
gall
and
the
thick
cigar
that
made
a
fit
ornament
for
her
purple
lips
and
her
envious
leer
and
yielding
to
a
generous
impulse
had
she
wished
not
to
disturb
the
pleasure
of
the
populace
by
her
sinister
appearance
ah
for
her
generous
impulses
existed
in
the
golden
age
the
house
showed
neither
lanterns
nor
banners
and
was
gloomy
precisely
because
the
town
was
making
merry
as
sinang
said
and
but
for
the
sentinel
walking
before
the
door
appeared
to
be
uninhabited
a
dim
light
shone
in
the
disordered
sala
rendering
transparent
the
dirty
on
which
the
cobwebs
had
fastened
and
the
dust
had
become
incrusted
the
lady
of
the
house
according
to
her
indolent
custom
was
dozing
on
a
wide
sofa
she
was
dressed
as
usual
that
is
badly
and
horribly
tied
round
her
head
a
pañuelo
from
beneath
which
escaped
thin
locks
of
tangled
hair
a
camisa
of
blue
flannel
over
another
which
must
once
have
been
white
and
a
faded
skirt
which
showed
the
outlines
of
her
thin
flat
thighs
placed
one
over
the
other
and
shaking
feverishly
from
her
mouth
issued
little
clouds
of
smoke
which
she
puffed
wearily
in
whatever
direction
she
happened
to
be
looking
when
she
opened
her
eyes
if
at
that
moment
don
francisco
de
cañamaque
could
have
seen
her
he
would
have
taken
her
for
a
cacique
of
the
town
or
the
and
then
decorated
his
discovery
with
commentaries
in
the
vernacular
of
the
markets
invented
by
him
for
her
particular
use
that
morning
she
had
not
attended
mass
not
because
she
had
not
so
desired
for
on
the
contrary
she
had
wished
to
show
herself
to
the
multitude
and
to
hear
the
sermon
but
her
spouse
had
not
permitted
her
to
do
so
his
refusal
being
accompanied
as
usual
by
two
or
three
insults
oaths
and
threats
of
kicking
the
alferez
knew
that
his
mate
dressed
ridiculously
and
had
the
appearance
of
what
is
known
as
a
of
the
soldiers
so
he
did
not
care
to
expose
her
to
the
gaze
of
strangers
and
persons
from
the
capital
but
she
did
not
so
understand
it
she
knew
that
she
was
beautiful
and
attractive
that
she
had
the
airs
of
a
queen
and
dressed
much
better
and
with
more
splendor
than
maria
clara
herself
who
wore
a
tapis
while
she
went
in
a
flowing
skirt
it
was
therefore
necessary
for
the
alferez
to
threaten
her
either
shut
up
or
i
kick
you
back
to
your
damned
town
doña
consolacion
did
not
care
to
return
to
her
town
at
the
toe
of
a
boot
but
she
meditated
revenge
never
had
the
dark
face
of
this
lady
been
such
as
to
inspire
confidence
in
any
one
not
even
when
she
painted
but
that
morning
it
greatly
worried
the
servants
especially
when
they
saw
her
move
about
the
house
from
one
part
to
another
silently
as
if
meditating
something
terrible
or
malign
her
glance
reflected
the
look
that
springs
from
the
eyes
of
a
serpent
when
caught
and
about
to
be
crushed
it
was
cold
luminous
and
penetrating
with
something
fascinating
loathsome
and
cruel
in
it
the
most
insignificant
error
the
least
unusual
noise
drew
from
her
a
vile
insult
that
struck
into
the
soul
but
no
one
answered
her
for
to
excuse
oneself
would
have
been
an
additional
fault
so
the
day
passed
not
encountering
any
obstacle
that
would
block
her
way
her
husband
had
been
invited
out
she
became
saturated
with
bile
the
cells
of
her
whole
organism
seemed
to
become
charged
with
electricity
which
threatened
to
burst
in
a
storm
of
hate
everything
about
her
folded
up
as
do
the
flowers
at
the
first
breath
of
the
hurricane
so
she
met
with
no
resistance
nor
found
any
point
or
high
place
to
discharge
her
evil
humor
the
soldiers
and
servants
kept
away
from
her
that
she
might
not
hear
the
sounds
of
rejoicing
outside
she
had
ordered
the
windows
closed
and
charged
the
sentinel
to
let
no
one
enter
she
tied
a
handkerchief
around
her
head
as
if
to
keep
it
from
bursting
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
sun
was
still
shining
ordered
the
lamps
to
be
lighted
sisa
as
we
saw
had
been
arrested
as
a
disturber
of
the
peace
and
taken
to
the
barracks
the
alferez
was
not
then
present
so
the
unfortunate
woman
had
had
to
spend
the
night
there
seated
on
a
bench
in
an
abandoned
attitude
the
next
day
the
alferez
saw
her
and
fearing
for
her
in
those
days
of
confusion
nor
caring
to
risk
a
disagreeable
scene
he
had
charged
the
soldiers
to
look
after
her
to
treat
her
kindly
and
to
give
her
something
to
eat
thus
the
madwoman
spent
two
days
tonight
whether
the
nearness
to
the
house
of
capitan
tiago
had
brought
to
her
maria
clara
sad
song
or
whether
other
recollections
awoke
in
her
old
melodies
whatever
the
cause
sisa
also
began
to
sing
in
a
sweet
and
melancholy
voice
the
of
her
youth
the
soldiers
heard
her
and
fell
silent
those
airs
awoke
old
memories
of
the
days
before
they
had
been
corrupted
doña
consolacion
also
heard
them
in
her
tedium
and
on
learning
who
it
was
that
sang
after
a
few
moments
of
meditation
ordered
that
sisa
be
brought
to
her
instantly
something
like
a
smile
wandered
over
her
dry
lips
when
sisa
was
brought
in
she
came
calmly
showing
neither
wonder
nor
fear
she
seemed
to
see
no
lady
or
mistress
and
this
wounded
the
vanity
of
the
muse
who
endeavored
to
inspire
respect
and
fear
she
coughed
made
a
sign
to
the
soldiers
to
leave
her
and
taking
down
her
husband
whip
said
to
the
crazy
woman
in
a
sinister
tone
come
on
icau
naturally
sisa
did
not
understand
such
tagalog
and
this
ignorance
calmed
the
medusa
wrath
for
one
of
the
beautiful
qualities
of
this
lady
was
to
try
not
to
know
tagalog
or
at
least
to
appear
not
to
know
it
speaking
it
the
worst
possible
she
would
thus
give
herself
the
air
of
a
genuine
as
she
was
accustomed
to
say
but
she
did
well
for
if
she
martyrized
tagalog
spanish
fared
no
better
with
her
either
in
regard
to
grammar
or
pronunciation
in
spite
of
her
husband
the
chairs
and
the
shoes
all
of
which
had
done
what
they
could
to
teach
her
one
of
the
words
that
had
cost
her
more
effort
than
the
hieroglyphics
cost
champollion
was
the
name
the
story
goes
that
on
the
day
after
her
wedding
when
she
was
talking
with
her
husband
who
was
then
a
corporal
she
had
said
the
corporal
thought
it
his
duty
to
correct
her
so
he
said
slapping
her
on
the
head
say
woman
do
be
stupid
do
you
know
that
what
your
damned
country
is
called
from
the
woman
dreaming
through
her
honeymoon
wished
to
obey
and
said
to
the
corporal
it
seemed
that
she
was
getting
nearer
to
it
so
he
increased
the
slaps
and
reprimanded
her
thus
but
woman
ca
you
pronounce
do
forget
it
you
know
the
king
don
felipe
the
fifth
say
and
add
to
it
which
in
latin
means
of
indians
and
you
have
the
name
of
your
damned
country
consolacion
at
that
time
a
washerwoman
patted
her
bruises
and
repeated
with
symptoms
of
losing
her
patience
felipe
nas
felipinas
so
the
corporal
saw
visions
how
could
it
be
instead
of
one
of
two
things
either
it
was
or
it
was
necessary
to
say
so
that
day
he
very
prudently
dropped
the
subject
leaving
his
wife
he
went
to
consult
the
books
here
his
astonishment
reached
a
climax
he
rubbed
his
eyes
let
see
slowly
now
filipinas
so
all
the
books
gave
it
neither
he
nor
his
wife
was
right
how
this
he
murmured
can
history
lie
does
this
book
say
that
alonso
saavedra
gave
the
country
that
name
in
honor
of
the
prince
don
felipe
how
was
that
name
corrupted
can
it
be
that
this
alonso
saavedra
was
an
indian
with
these
doubts
he
went
to
consult
the
sergeant
gomez
who
as
a
youth
had
wanted
to
be
a
curate
without
deigning
to
look
at
the
corporal
the
sergeant
blew
out
a
mouthful
of
smoke
and
answered
with
great
pompousness
in
ancient
times
it
was
pronounced
instead
of
but
since
we
moderns
have
become
frenchified
we
ca
endure
two
in
succession
so
cultured
people
especially
in
madrid
you
never
been
in
madrid
cultured
people
as
i
say
have
begun
to
change
the
first
to
in
many
words
this
is
called
modernizing
yourself
the
poor
corporal
had
never
been
in
madrid
here
was
the
cause
of
his
failure
to
understand
the
riddle
what
things
are
learned
in
madrid
so
now
it
proper
to
say
in
the
ancient
style
man
this
country
not
yet
cultured
in
the
ancient
style
exclaimed
gomez
disdainfully
the
corporal
even
if
he
was
a
bad
philologist
was
yet
a
good
husband
what
he
had
just
learned
his
spouse
must
also
know
so
he
proceeded
with
her
education
consola
what
do
you
call
your
damned
country
what
should
i
call
it
just
what
you
taught
me
i
throw
a
chair
at
you
you
yesterday
you
pronounced
it
even
better
in
the
modern
style
but
now
it
proper
to
pronounce
it
like
an
ancient
i
mean
remember
that
i
no
ancient
what
are
you
thinking
about
never
mind
say
i
do
want
to
i
no
ancient
baggage
scarcely
thirty
years
old
she
replied
rolling
up
her
sleeves
and
preparing
herself
for
the
fray
say
it
you
or
i
throw
this
chair
at
you
consolacion
saw
the
movement
reflected
then
began
to
stammer
with
heavy
breaths
file
pum
crack
the
chair
finished
the
word
so
the
lesson
ended
in
fisticuffs
scratchings
slaps
the
corporal
caught
her
by
the
hair
she
grabbed
his
goatee
but
was
unable
to
bite
because
of
her
loose
teeth
he
let
out
a
yell
released
her
and
begged
her
pardon
blood
began
to
flow
one
eye
got
redder
than
the
other
a
camisa
was
torn
into
shreds
many
things
came
to
light
but
not
similar
incidents
occurred
every
time
the
question
of
language
came
up
the
corporal
watching
her
linguistic
progress
sorrowfully
calculated
that
in
ten
years
his
mate
would
have
completely
forgotten
how
to
talk
and
this
was
about
what
really
came
to
pass
when
they
were
married
she
still
knew
tagalog
and
could
make
herself
understood
in
spanish
but
now
at
the
time
of
our
story
she
no
longer
spoke
any
language
she
had
become
so
addicted
to
expressing
herself
by
means
of
signs
and
of
these
she
chose
the
loudest
and
most
impressive
that
she
could
have
given
odds
to
the
inventor
of
volapuk
sisa
therefore
had
the
good
fortune
not
to
understand
her
so
the
medusa
smoothed
out
her
eyebrows
a
little
while
a
smile
of
satisfaction
lighted
up
her
face
undoubtedly
she
did
not
know
tagalog
she
was
an
boy
tell
her
in
tagalog
to
sing
she
does
understand
me
she
does
understand
spanish
the
madwoman
understood
the
boy
and
began
to
sing
the
of
the
doña
consolacion
listened
at
first
with
a
sneer
which
disappeared
little
by
little
from
her
lips
she
became
attentive
then
serious
and
even
somewhat
thoughtful
the
voice
the
sentiment
in
the
lines
and
the
song
itself
affected
her
that
dry
and
withered
heart
was
perhaps
thirsting
for
rain
she
understood
it
well
the
sadness
the
cold
and
the
moisture
that
descend
from
the
sky
when
wrapped
in
the
mantle
of
night
so
ran
the
seemed
to
be
descending
also
on
her
heart
the
withered
and
faded
flower
which
during
the
day
flaunted
her
finery
seeking
applause
and
full
of
vanity
at
eventide
repentant
and
disenchanted
makes
an
effort
to
raise
her
drooping
petals
to
the
sky
seeking
a
little
shade
to
hide
herself
and
die
without
the
mocking
of
the
light
that
saw
her
in
her
splendor
without
seeing
the
vanity
of
her
pride
begging
also
that
a
little
dew
should
weep
upon
her
the
nightbird
leaves
his
solitary
retreat
the
hollow
of
an
ancient
trunk
and
disturbs
the
sad
loneliness
of
the
open
places
no
do
sing
she
exclaimed
in
perfect
tagalog
as
she
rose
with
agitation
do
sing
those
verses
hurt
me
the
crazy
woman
became
silent
the
boy
ejaculated
she
talks
tagalog
and
stood
staring
with
admiration
at
his
mistress
who
realizing
that
she
had
given
herself
away
was
ashamed
of
it
and
as
her
nature
was
not
that
of
a
woman
the
shame
took
the
aspect
of
rage
and
hate
so
she
showed
the
door
to
the
imprudent
boy
and
closed
it
behind
him
with
a
kick
twisting
the
whip
in
her
nervous
hands
she
took
a
few
turns
around
the
room
then
stopping
suddenly
in
front
of
the
crazy
woman
said
to
her
in
spanish
dance
but
sisa
did
not
move
dance
dance
she
repeated
in
a
sinister
tone
the
madwoman
looked
at
her
with
wandering
expressionless
eyes
while
the
alfereza
lifted
one
of
her
arms
then
the
other
and
shook
them
but
to
no
purpose
for
sisa
did
not
understand
then
she
began
to
jump
about
and
shake
herself
encouraging
sisa
to
imitate
her
in
the
distance
was
to
be
heard
the
music
of
the
procession
playing
a
grave
and
majestic
march
but
doña
consolacion
danced
furiously
keeping
other
time
to
other
music
resounding
within
her
sisa
gazed
at
her
without
moving
while
her
eyes
expressed
curiosity
and
something
like
a
weak
smile
hovered
around
her
pallid
lips
the
lady
dancing
amused
her
the
latter
stopped
as
if
ashamed
raised
the
whip
that
terrible
whip
known
to
thieves
and
soldiers
made
in
ulango
and
perfected
by
the
alferez
with
twisted
wires
and
said
now
your
turn
to
dance
dance
she
began
to
strike
the
madwoman
bare
feet
gently
with
the
whip
sisa
face
drew
up
with
pain
and
she
was
forced
to
protect
herself
with
her
hands
aha
now
you
starting
she
exclaimed
with
savage
joy
passing
from
to
the
afflicted
sisa
gave
a
cry
of
pain
and
quickly
raised
her
foot
you
got
to
dance
you
indian
the
whip
swung
and
whistled
sisa
let
herself
fall
to
the
floor
and
placed
both
hands
on
her
knees
while
she
gazed
at
her
tormentor
with
eyes
two
sharp
cuts
of
the
whip
on
her
shoulder
made
her
stand
up
and
it
was
not
merely
a
cry
but
a
howl
that
the
unfortunate
woman
uttered
her
thin
camisa
was
torn
her
skin
broken
and
the
blood
was
flowing
the
sight
of
blood
arouses
the
tiger
the
blood
of
her
victim
aroused
doña
consolacion
dance
damn
you
dance
evil
to
the
mother
who
bore
you
she
cried
dance
or
i
flog
you
to
death
she
then
caught
sisa
with
one
hand
and
whipping
her
with
the
other
began
to
dance
about
the
crazy
woman
at
last
understood
and
followed
the
example
by
swinging
her
arms
about
awkwardly
a
smile
of
satisfaction
curled
the
lips
of
her
teacher
the
smile
of
a
female
mephistopheles
who
succeeds
in
getting
a
great
pupil
there
were
in
it
hate
disdain
jest
and
cruelty
with
a
burst
of
demoniacal
laughter
she
could
not
have
expressed
more
thus
absorbed
in
the
joy
of
the
sight
she
was
not
aware
of
the
arrival
of
her
husband
until
he
opened
the
door
with
a
loud
kick
the
alferez
appeared
pale
and
gloomy
and
when
he
saw
what
was
going
on
he
threw
a
terrible
glance
at
his
wife
who
did
not
move
from
her
place
but
stood
smiling
at
him
cynically
the
alferez
put
his
hand
as
gently
as
he
could
on
the
shoulder
of
the
strange
dancer
and
made
her
stop
the
crazy
woman
sighed
and
sank
slowly
to
the
floor
covered
with
her
own
blood
the
silence
continued
the
alferez
breathed
heavily
while
his
wife
watched
him
with
questioning
eyes
she
picked
up
the
whip
and
asked
in
a
smooth
soft
voice
what
the
matter
with
you
you
even
wished
me
good
evening
the
alferez
did
not
answer
but
instead
called
the
boy
and
said
to
him
take
this
woman
away
and
tell
marta
to
get
her
some
other
clothes
and
attend
to
her
you
give
her
something
to
eat
and
a
good
bed
take
care
that
she
is
tomorrow
she
be
taken
to
señor
ibarra
house
then
he
closed
the
door
carefully
bolted
it
and
approached
his
wife
you
tempting
me
to
kill
you
he
exclaimed
doubling
up
his
fists
what
the
matter
with
you
she
asked
rising
and
drawing
away
from
him
what
the
matter
with
me
he
yelled
in
a
voice
of
thunder
letting
out
an
oath
and
holding
up
before
her
a
sheet
of
paper
covered
with
scrawls
did
you
write
this
letter
to
the
alcalde
saying
that
i
bribed
to
permit
gambling
huh
i
do
know
why
i
do
beat
you
to
death
let
see
you
let
see
you
try
it
if
you
dare
she
replied
with
a
jeering
laugh
the
one
who
beats
me
to
death
has
got
to
be
more
of
a
man
than
you
are
he
heard
the
insult
but
saw
the
whip
catching
up
a
plate
from
the
table
he
threw
it
at
her
head
but
she
accustomed
to
such
fights
dodged
quickly
and
the
plate
was
shattered
against
the
wall
a
cup
and
saucer
met
with
a
similar
fate
coward
she
yelled
you
afraid
to
come
near
me
and
to
exasperate
him
the
more
she
spat
upon
him
the
alferez
went
blind
from
rage
and
with
a
roar
attempted
to
throw
himself
upon
her
but
she
with
astonishing
quickness
hit
him
across
the
face
with
the
whip
and
ran
hurriedly
into
an
inner
room
shutting
and
bolting
the
door
violently
behind
her
bellowing
with
rage
and
pain
he
followed
but
was
only
able
to
run
against
the
door
which
made
him
vomit
oaths
accursed
be
your
offspring
you
sow
open
open
or
i
break
your
head
he
howled
beating
the
door
with
his
hands
and
feet
no
answer
was
heard
but
instead
the
scraping
of
chairs
and
trunks
as
if
she
was
building
a
barricade
with
the
furniture
the
house
shook
under
the
kicks
and
curses
of
the
alferez
do
come
in
do
come
in
called
the
sour
voice
inside
if
you
show
yourself
i
shoot
you
by
degrees
he
appeared
to
become
calm
and
contented
himself
with
walking
up
and
down
the
room
like
a
wild
beast
in
its
cage
go
out
into
the
street
and
cool
off
your
head
the
woman
continued
to
jeer
at
him
as
she
now
seemed
to
have
completed
her
preparations
for
defense
i
swear
that
if
i
catch
you
even
god
wo
save
you
you
old
sow
yes
now
you
can
say
what
you
like
you
did
want
me
to
go
to
mass
you
did
let
me
attend
to
my
religious
duties
she
answered
with
such
sarcasm
as
only
she
knew
how
to
use
the
alferez
put
on
his
helmet
arranged
his
clothing
a
little
and
went
out
with
heavy
steps
but
returned
after
a
few
minutes
without
making
the
least
noise
having
taken
off
his
shoes
the
servants
accustomed
to
these
brawls
were
usually
bored
but
this
novelty
of
the
shoes
attracted
their
attention
so
they
winked
to
one
another
the
alferez
sat
down
quietly
in
a
chair
at
the
side
of
the
sublime
port
and
had
the
patience
to
wait
for
more
than
half
an
hour
have
you
really
gone
out
or
are
you
still
there
old
goat
asked
the
voice
from
time
to
time
changing
the
epithets
and
raising
the
tone
at
last
she
began
to
take
away
the
furniture
piece
by
piece
he
heard
the
noise
and
smiled
boy
has
your
master
gone
out
cried
doña
consolacion
at
a
sign
from
the
alferez
the
boy
answered
yes
señora
gone
out
a
gleeful
laugh
was
heard
from
her
as
she
pulled
back
the
bolt
slowly
her
husband
arose
the
door
opened
a
little
way
a
yell
the
sound
of
a
falling
body
oaths
howls
curses
blows
hoarse
voices
who
can
tell
what
took
place
in
the
darkness
of
that
room
as
the
boy
went
out
into
the
kitchen
he
made
a
significant
sign
to
the
cook
who
said
to
him
you
pay
for
that
i
in
any
case
the
whole
town
will
she
asked
me
if
he
had
gone
out
not
if
he
had
come
back
chapter
xl
right
and
might
ten
at
night
the
last
rockets
rose
lazily
in
the
dark
sky
where
a
few
paper
balloons
recently
inflated
with
smoke
and
hot
air
still
glimmered
like
new
stars
some
of
those
adorned
with
fireworks
took
fire
threatening
all
the
houses
so
there
might
be
seen
on
the
ridges
of
the
roofs
men
armed
with
pails
of
water
and
long
poles
with
pieces
of
cloth
on
the
ends
their
black
silhouettes
stood
out
in
the
vague
clearness
of
the
air
like
phantoms
that
had
descended
from
space
to
witness
the
rejoicings
of
men
many
pieces
of
fireworks
of
fantastic
shapes
wheels
castles
bulls
carabaos
had
been
set
off
surpassing
in
beauty
and
grandeur
anything
ever
before
seen
by
the
inhabitants
of
san
diego
now
the
people
were
moving
in
crowds
toward
the
plaza
to
attend
the
theater
for
the
last
time
here
and
there
might
be
seen
bengal
lights
fantastically
illuminating
the
merry
groups
while
the
boys
were
availing
themselves
of
torches
to
hunt
in
the
grass
for
unexploded
bombs
and
other
remnants
that
could
still
be
used
but
soon
the
music
gave
the
signal
and
all
abandoned
the
open
places
the
great
stage
was
brilliantly
illuminated
thousands
of
lights
surrounded
the
posts
hung
from
the
roof
or
sowed
the
floor
with
pyramidal
clusters
an
alguazil
was
looking
after
these
and
when
he
came
forward
to
attend
to
them
the
crowd
shouted
at
him
and
whistled
there
he
is
there
he
is
in
front
of
the
curtain
the
orchestra
players
were
tuning
their
instruments
and
playing
preludes
of
airs
behind
them
was
the
space
spoken
of
by
the
correspondent
in
his
letter
where
the
leading
citizens
of
the
town
the
spaniards
and
the
rich
visitors
occupied
rows
of
chairs
the
general
public
the
nameless
rabble
filled
up
the
rest
of
the
place
some
of
them
bringing
benches
on
their
shoulders
not
so
much
for
seats
as
to
make
up
for
their
lack
of
stature
this
provoked
noisy
protests
on
the
part
of
the
benchless
so
the
offenders
got
down
at
once
but
before
long
they
were
up
again
as
if
nothing
had
happened
goings
and
comings
cries
exclamations
bursts
of
laughter
a
turned
loose
a
firecracker
set
off
all
contributed
to
swell
the
uproar
here
a
bench
had
a
leg
broken
off
and
the
people
fell
to
the
ground
amid
the
laughter
of
the
crowd
they
were
visitors
who
had
come
from
afar
to
observe
and
now
found
themselves
the
observed
over
there
they
quarreled
and
disputed
over
a
seat
a
little
farther
on
was
heard
the
noise
of
breaking
glass
it
was
andeng
carrying
refreshments
and
drinks
holding
the
wide
tray
carefully
with
both
hands
but
by
chance
she
had
met
her
sweetheart
who
tried
to
take
advantage
of
the
situation
the
don
filipo
presided
over
the
show
as
the
gobernadorcillo
was
fond
of
monte
he
was
talking
with
old
tasio
what
can
i
do
the
alcalde
was
unwilling
to
accept
my
resignation
you
feel
strong
enough
to
attend
to
your
duties
he
asked
me
how
did
you
answer
him
alcalde
i
answered
strength
of
a
however
insignificant
it
may
be
is
like
all
other
authority
it
emanates
from
higher
spheres
the
king
himself
receives
his
strength
from
the
people
and
the
people
theirs
from
god
that
is
exactly
what
i
lack
señor
alcalde
but
he
did
not
care
to
listen
to
me
telling
me
that
we
would
talk
about
it
after
the
fiesta
then
may
god
help
you
said
the
old
man
starting
away
do
you
want
to
see
the
show
thanks
no
for
dreams
and
nonsense
i
am
sufficient
unto
myself
the
sage
answered
with
a
sarcastic
smile
but
now
i
think
of
it
has
your
attention
never
been
drawn
to
the
character
of
our
people
peaceful
yet
fond
of
warlike
shows
and
bloody
fights
democratic
yet
adoring
emperors
kings
and
princes
irreligious
yet
impoverishing
itself
by
costly
religious
pageants
our
women
have
gentle
natures
yet
go
wild
with
joy
when
a
princess
flourishes
a
lance
do
you
know
to
what
it
is
due
well
the
arrival
of
maria
clara
and
her
friends
put
an
end
to
this
conversation
don
filipo
met
them
and
ushered
them
to
their
seats
behind
them
came
the
curate
with
another
franciscan
and
some
spaniards
following
the
priests
were
a
number
of
the
townsmen
who
make
it
their
business
to
escort
the
friars
may
god
reward
them
also
in
the
next
life
muttered
old
tasio
as
he
went
away
the
play
began
with
chananay
and
marianito
in
é
la
all
now
had
their
eyes
and
ears
turned
to
the
stage
all
but
one
padre
salvi
who
seemed
to
have
gone
there
for
no
other
purpose
than
that
of
watching
maria
clara
whose
sadness
gave
to
her
beauty
an
air
so
ideal
and
interesting
that
it
was
easy
to
understand
how
she
might
be
looked
upon
with
rapture
but
the
eyes
of
the
franciscan
deeply
hidden
in
their
sunken
sockets
spoke
nothing
of
rapture
in
that
gloomy
gaze
was
to
be
read
something
desperately
sad
with
such
eyes
cain
might
have
gazed
from
afar
on
the
paradise
whose
delights
his
mother
pictured
to
him
the
first
scene
was
over
when
ibarra
entered
his
appearance
caused
a
murmur
and
attention
was
fixed
on
him
and
the
curate
but
the
young
man
seemed
not
to
notice
anything
as
he
greeted
maria
clara
and
her
friends
in
a
natural
way
and
took
a
seat
beside
them
the
only
one
who
spoke
to
him
was
sinang
did
you
see
the
fireworks
she
asked
no
little
friend
i
had
to
go
with
the
well
that
a
shame
the
curate
was
with
us
and
told
us
stories
of
the
damned
can
you
imagine
it
to
fill
us
with
fear
so
that
we
might
not
enjoy
ourselves
can
you
imagine
it
the
curate
arose
and
approached
don
filipo
with
whom
he
began
an
animated
conversation
the
former
spoke
in
a
nervous
manner
the
latter
in
a
low
measured
voice
i
sorry
that
i
ca
please
your
reverence
said
don
filipo
but
señor
ibarra
is
one
of
the
heaviest
contributors
and
has
a
right
to
be
here
as
long
as
he
does
disturb
the
peace
but
is
it
disturbing
the
peace
to
scandalize
good
christians
letting
a
wolf
enter
the
fold
you
will
answer
for
this
to
god
and
the
authorities
i
always
answer
for
the
actions
that
spring
from
my
own
will
padre
replied
don
filipo
with
a
slight
bow
but
my
little
authority
does
not
empower
me
to
mix
in
religious
affairs
those
who
wish
to
avoid
contact
with
him
need
not
talk
to
him
señor
ibarra
forces
himself
on
no
one
but
it
giving
opportunity
for
danger
and
he
who
loves
danger
perishes
in
it
i
do
see
any
danger
padre
the
alcalde
and
the
my
superior
officers
have
been
talking
with
him
all
the
afternoon
and
it
not
for
me
to
teach
them
a
lesson
if
you
do
put
him
out
of
here
we
leave
i
very
sorry
but
i
ca
put
any
one
out
of
here
the
curate
repented
of
his
threat
but
it
was
too
late
to
retract
so
he
made
a
sign
to
his
companion
who
arose
with
regret
and
the
two
went
out
together
the
persons
attached
to
them
followed
their
example
casting
looks
of
hatred
at
ibarra
the
murmurs
and
whispers
increased
a
number
of
people
approached
the
young
man
and
said
to
him
we
with
you
do
take
any
notice
of
them
whom
do
you
mean
by
ibarra
asked
in
surprise
those
who
just
left
to
avoid
contact
with
you
left
to
avoid
contact
with
me
yes
they
say
that
you
excommunicated
excommunicated
the
astonished
youth
did
not
know
what
to
say
he
looked
about
him
and
saw
that
maria
clara
was
hiding
her
face
behind
her
fan
but
is
it
possible
he
exclaimed
finally
are
we
still
in
the
dark
ages
so
he
approached
the
young
women
and
said
with
a
change
of
tone
excuse
me
i
forgotten
an
engagement
i
be
back
to
see
you
home
stay
sinang
said
to
him
yeyeng
is
going
to
dance

the
uproar

fancifully
dressed
with
the

carvajal
was
answering
her
usté
when
two
soldiers
of
the
civil
guard
went
up
to
don
filipo
and
ordered
him
to
stop
the
performance
why
asked

surprise
because
the
alferez
and
his
wife
have
been
fighting
and
ca
sleep
tell
the
alferez
that
we
have
permission
from
the
alcalde
and
that
against
such
permission
in
the
town
has
any
authority
not
even
the
gobernadorcillo
himself
and
is
my
well
the
show
must
stop
repeated
the
soldiers
don
filipo
turned
his
back
and
they
went
away
in
order
not
to
disturb
the
merriment
he
told
no
one
about
the
incident
after
the
selection
of
vaudeville
which
was
loudly
applauded
the
prince
villardo
presented
himself
challenging
to
mortal
combat
the
moros
who
held
his
father
prisoner
the
hero
threatened
to
cut
off
all
their
heads
at
a
single
stroke
and
send
them
to
the
moon
but
fortunately
for
the
moros
who
were
disposing
themselves
for
the
combat
a
tumult
arose
the
orchestra
suddenly
ceased
playing
threw
their
instruments
away
and
jumped
up
on
the
stage
the
valiant
villardo
not
expecting
them
and
taking
them
for
allies
of
the
moros
dropped
his
sword
and
shield
and
started
to
run
the
moros
seeing
that
such
a
doughty
christian
was
fleeing
did
not
consider
it
improper
to
imitate
him
cries
groans
prayers
oaths
were
heard
while
the
people
ran
and
pushed
one
another
about
the
lights
were
extinguished
blazing
lamps
were
thrown
into
the
air

some

fire
robbers
shouted
others
women
and
children
wept
benches
and
spectators
were
rolled
together
on
the
ground
amid
the
general
pandemonium
the
cause
of
all
this
uproar
was
two
clubs
in
hand
chasing
the
musicians
in
order
to
break
up
the
performance
the
with
the
aid
of
the
cuadrilleros
who
were
armed
with
old
sabers
managed
at
length
to
arrest
them
in
spite
of
their
resistance
take
them
to
the
town
hall
cried
don
filipo
take
care
that
they
do
get
away
ibarra
had
returned
to
look
for
maria
clara
the
frightened
girls
clung
to
him
pale
and
trembling
while
aunt
isabel
recited
the
latin
litany
when
the
people
were
somewhat
calmed
down
from
their
fright
and
had
learned
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
they
were
beside
themselves
with
indignation
stones
rained
on
the
squad
of
cuadrilleros
who
were
conducting
the
two
offenders
from
the
scene
and
there
were
even
those
who
proposed
to
set
fire
to
the
barracks
of
the
civil
guard
so
as
to
roast
doña
consolacion
along
with
the
alferez
that
what
they
good
for
cried
a
woman
doubling
up
her
fists
and
stretching
out
her
arms
to
disturb
the
town
they
do
chase
any
but
honest
folks
out
yonder
are
the
tulisanes
and
the
gamblers
set
fire
to
the
barracks
one
man
was
beating
himself
on
the
arm
and
begging
for
confession
plaintive
sounds
issued
from
under
the
overturned
benches
it
was
a
poor
musician
the
stage
was
crowded
with
actors
and
spectators
all
talking
at
the
same
time
there
was
chananay
dressed
as
leonor
in
talking
in
the
language
of
the
markets
to
ratia
in
the
costume
of
a
schoolmaster
yeyeng
wrapped
in
a
silk
shawl
was
clinging
to
the
prince
villardo
while
balbino
and
the
moros
were
exerting
themselves
to
console
the
more
or
less
injured
musicians
several
spaniards
went
from
group
to
group
haranguing
every
one
they
met
a
large
crowd
was
forming
whose
intention
don
filipo
seemed
to
be
aware
of
for
he
ran
to
stop
them
do
disturb
the
peace
he
cried
tomorrow
we
ask
for
an
accounting
and
we
get
justice
i
answer
for
it
that
we
get
justice
no
was
the
reply
of
several
they
did
the
same
thing
in
kalamba
the
same
promise
was
made
but
the
alcalde
did
nothing
take
the
law
into
our
own
hands
to
the
barracks
in
vain
the
pleaded
with
them
the
crowd
maintained
its
hostile
attitude
so
he
looked
about
him
for
help
and
noticed
ibarra
señor
ibarra
as
a
favor
restrain
them
while
i
get
some
cuadrilleros
what
can
i
do
asked
the
perplexed
youth
but
the
was
already
at
a
distance
he
gazed
about
him
seeking
he
knew
not
whom
when
accidentally
he
discerned
elias
who
stood
impassively
watching
the
disturbance
ibarra
ran
to
him
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
said
to
him
in
spanish
for
god
sake
do
something
if
you
can
i
ca
do
anything
the
pilot
must
have
understood
him
for
he
disappeared
in
the
crowd
lively
disputes
and
sharp
exclamations
were
heard
gradually
the
crowd
began
to
break
up
its
members
each
taking
a
less
hostile
attitude
it
was
high
time
indeed
for
the
soldiers
were
already
rushing
out
armed
and
with
fixed
bayonets
meanwhile
what
had
the
curate
been
doing
padre
salvi
had
not
gone
to
bed
but
had
stood
motionless
resting
his
forehead
against
the
curtains
and
gazing
toward
the
plaza
from
time
to
time
a
suppressed
sigh
escaped
him
and
if
the
light
of
the
lamp
had
not
been
so
dim
perhaps
it
would
have
been
possible
to
see
his
eyes
fill
with
tears
thus
nearly
an
hour
passed
the
tumult
in
the
plaza
awoke
him
from
his
reverie
with
startled
eyes
he
saw
the
confused
movements
of
the
people
while
their
voices
came
up
to
him
faintly
a
breathless
servant
informed
him
of
what
was
happening
a
thought
shot
across
his
mind
in
the
midst
of
confusion
and
tumult
is
the
time
when
libertines
take
advantage
of
the
consternation
and
weakness
of
woman
every
one
seeks
to
save
himself
no
one
thinks
of
any
one
else
a
cry
is
not
heard
or
heeded
women
faint
are
struck
and
fall
terror
and
fright
heed
not
shame
under
the
cover
of
night
and
when
they
are
in
love
he
imagined
that
he
saw
crisostomo
snatch
the
fainting
maria
clara
up
in
his
arms
and
disappear
into
the
darkness
so
he
went
down
the
stairway
by
leaps
and
bounds
and
without
hat
or
cane
made
for
the
plaza
like
a
madman
there
he
met
some
spaniards
who
were
reprimanding
the
soldiers
but
on
looking
toward
the
seats
that
the
girls
had
occupied
he
saw
that
they
were
vacant
padre
padre
cried
the
spaniards
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
them
as
he
ran
in
the
direction
of
capitan
tiago
there
he
breathed
more
freely
for
he
saw
in
the
open
hallway
the
adorable
silhouette
full
of
grace
and
soft
in
outline
of
maria
clara
and
that
of
the
aunt
carrying
cups
and
glasses
ah
he
murmured
it
seems
that
she
has
been
taken
sick
only
aunt
isabel
at
that
moment
closed
the
windows
and
the
graceful
shadow
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
the
curate
moved
away
without
heeding
the
crowd
he
had
before
his
eyes
the
beautiful
form
of
a
maiden
sleeping
and
breathing
sweetly
her
eyelids
were
shaded
by
long
lashes
which
formed
graceful
curves
like
those
of
the
virgins
of
raphael
the
little
mouth
was
smiling
all
the
features
breathed
forth
virginity
purity
and
innocence
that
countenance
formed
a
sweet
vision
in
the
midst
of
the
white
coverings
of
her
bed
like
the
head
of
a
cherub
among
the
clouds
his
imagination
went
still
further
but
who
can
write
what
a
burning
brain
can
imagine
perhaps
only
the
newspaper
correspondent
who
concluded
his
account
of
the
fiesta
and
its
accompanying
incidents
in
the
following
manner
a
thousand
thanks
infinite
thanks
to
the
opportune
and
active
intervention
of
the
very
reverend
padre
fray
bernardo
salvi
who
defying
every
danger
in
the
midst
of
the
unbridled
mob
without
hat
or
cane
calmed
the
wrath
of
the
crowd
using
only
his
persuasive
word
with
the
majesty
and
authority
that
are
never
lacking
to
a
minister
of
a
religion
of
peace
with
unparalleled
this
virtuous
priest
tore
himself
from
sweet
repose
such
as
every
good
conscience
like
his
enjoys
and
rushed
to
protect
his
flock
from
the
least
harm
the
people
of
san
diego
will
hardly
forget
this
sublime
deed
of
their
heroic
pastor
remembering
to
hold
themselves
grateful
to
him
for
all
eternity
chapter
xli
two
visits
ibarra
was
in
such
a
state
of
mind
that
he
found
it
impossible
to
sleep
so
to
distract
his
attention
from
the
sad
thoughts
which
are
so
exaggerated
during
the
he
set
to
work
in
his
lonely
cabinet
day
found
him
still
making
mixtures
and
combinations
to
the
action
of
which
he
subjected
pieces
of
bamboo
and
other
substances
placing
them
afterwards
in
numbered
and
sealed
jars
a
servant
entered
to
announce
the
arrival
of
a
man
who
had
the
appearance
of
being
from
the
country
show
him
in
said
ibarra
without
looking
around
elias
entered
and
remained
standing
in
silence
ah
it
you
exclaimed
ibarra
in
tagalog
when
he
recognized
him
excuse
me
for
making
you
wait
i
did
notice
that
it
was
you
i
making
an
important
experiment
i
do
want
to
disturb
you
answered
the
youthful
pilot
come
first
to
ask
you
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
for
you
in
the
province
of
batangas
for
which
i
am
leaving
immediately
and
also
to
bring
you
some
bad
news
ibarra
questioned
him
with
a
look
capitan
tiago
daughter
is
ill
continued
elias
quietly
but
not
seriously
that
what
i
feared
murmured
ibarra
in
a
weak
voice
do
you
know
what
is
the
matter
with
her
a
fever
now
if
you
have
nothing
to
command
thank
you
my
friend
no
i
wish
you
a
pleasant
journey
but
first
let
me
ask
you
a
question
if
it
is
indiscreet
do
not
answer
elias
bowed
how
were
you
able
to
quiet
the
disturbance
last
night
asked
ibarra
looking
steadily
at
him
very
easily
answered
elias
in
the
most
natural
manner
the
leaders
of
the
commotion
were
two
brothers
whose
father
died
from
a
beating
given
him
by
the
civil
guard
one
day
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
save
them
from
the
same
hands
into
which
their
father
had
fallen
and
both
are
accordingly
grateful
to
me
i
appealed
to
them
last
night
and
they
undertook
to
dissuade
the
rest
and
those
two
brothers
whose
father
died
from
the
beating
will
end
as
their
father
did
replied
elias
in
a
low
voice
when
misfortune
has
once
singled
out
a
family
all
its
members
must
perish
when
the
lightning
strikes
a
tree
the
whole
is
reduced
to
ashes
ibarra
fell
silent
on
hearing
this
so
elias
took
his
leave
when
the
youth
found
himself
alone
he
lost
the
serene
he
had
maintained
in
the
pilot
presence
his
sorrow
pictured
itself
on
his
countenance
i
i
have
made
her
suffer
he
murmured
he
dressed
himself
quickly
and
descended
the
stairs
a
small
man
dressed
in
mourning
with
a
large
scar
on
his
left
cheek
saluted
him
humbly
and
detained
him
on
his
way
what
do
you
want
asked
ibarra
sir
my
name
is
lucas
and
i
the
brother
of
the
man
who
was
killed
yesterday
ah
you
have
my
sympathy
well
sir
i
want
to
know
how
much
you
going
to
pay
my
brother
family
pay
repeated
the
young
man
unable
to
conceal
his
disgust
talk
of
that
later
come
back
this
afternoon
i
in
a
hurry
now
only
tell
me
how
much
you
willing
to
pay
insisted
lucas
i
told
you
that
we
talk
about
that
some
other
time
i
time
now
repeated
ibarra
impatiently
you
have
time
now
sir
asked
lucas
bitterly
placing
himself
in
front
of
the
young
man
you
have
time
to
consider
the
dead
come
this
afternoon
my
good
man
replied
ibarra
restraining
himself
i
on
my
way
now
to
visit
a
sick
person
ah
for
the
sick
you
forget
the
dead
do
you
think
that
because
we
are
poor
ibarra
looked
at
him
and
interrupted
do
try
my
patience
then
went
on
his
way
lucas
stood
looking
after
him
with
a
smile
full
of
hate
it
easy
to
see
that
you
the
grandson
of
the
man
who
tied
my
father
out
in
the
sun
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
you
still
have
the
same
blood
then
with
a
change
of
tone
he
added
but
if
you
pay
well
friends
chapter
xlii
the
espadañas
the
fiesta
is
over
the
people
of
the
town
have
again
found
as
in
every
other
year
that
their
treasury
is
poorer
that
they
have
worked
sweated
and
stayed
awake
much
without
really
amusing
themselves
without
gaining
any
new
friends
and
in
a
word
that
they
have
dearly
bought
their
dissipation
and
their
headaches
but
this
matters
nothing
for
the
same
will
be
done
next
year
the
same
the
coming
century
since
it
has
always
been
the
custom
in
capitan
tiago
house
sadness
reigns
all
the
windows
are
closed
the
inmates
move
about
noiselessly
and
only
in
the
kitchen
do
they
dare
to
speak
in
natural
tones
maria
clara
the
soul
of
the
house
lies
sick
in
bed
and
her
condition
is
reflected
in
all
the
faces
as
the
sorrows
of
the
mind
may
be
read
in
the
countenance
of
an
individual
which
seems
best
to
you
isabel
shall
i
make
a
to
the
cross
of
tunasan
or
to
the
cross
of
matahong
asks
the
afflicted
father
in
a
low
voice
the
tunasan
cross
grows
while
the
matahong
cross
sweats
which
do
you
think
is
more
miraculous
aunt
isabel
reflects
shakes
her
head
and
murmurs
to
grow
to
grow
is
a
greater
miracle
than
to
sweat
all
of
us
sweat
but
not
all
of
us
grow
that
right
isabel
but
remember
that
to
sweat
for
the
wood
of
which
are
made
to
sweat
is
not
a
small
miracle
come
the
best
thing
will
be
to
make
to
both
crosses
so
neither
will
resent
it
and
maria
will
get
better
sooner
are
the
rooms
ready
you
know
that
with
the
doctors
is
coming
a
new
gentleman
a
distant
relative
of

nothing
should
be
lacking
at
the
other
end
of
the
are
the
two
cousins

the
of
maria
clara
asks
victoria

latter
the
only
thing
that
i
know
about
him
is
that
he
charges

to
capitan
tiago
then
he
must
be
good
exclaims
andeng
the
one
who
performed
an
operation
on
doña
maria
charged

so
he
was
learned
silly
retorts
sinang
every
one

learned
look

guevara
after
performing
a
bungling
operation
that
cost
the
life
of
both
mother
and
child
he
charged
the
widower

journey

the
sound
of
a
carriage
stopping
in

of

house

an
end
to
these
conversations
capitan

young
man
bowed
politely
and
capitan
tiago
came
very
near
to
kissing
his
hand
while
their
numerous
trunks
and
are
being
carried
in
and
capitan
tiago
is
conducting
them
to
their
rooms
let
us
talk
a
little
of
this
couple
whose
acquaintance
we
made
slightly
in
the
first
chapters
doña
victorina
was
a
lady
of
forty
and
five
winters
which
were
equivalent
to
thirty
and
two
summers
according
to
her
arithmetical
calculations
she
had
been
beautiful
in
her
youth
having
had
as
she
used
to
say
flesh
but
in
the
ecstasies
of
contemplating
herself
she
had
looked
with
disdain
on
her
many
filipino
admirers
since
her
aspirations
were
toward
another
race
she
had
refused
to
bestow
on
any
one
her
little
white
hand
not
indeed
from
distrust
for
not
a
few
times
had
she
given
jewelry
and
gems
of
great
value
to
various
foreign
and
spanish
adventurers
six
months
before
the
time
of
our
story
she
had
seen
realized
her
most
beautiful
dream
the
dream
of
her
whole
life
for
which
she
might
scorn
the
fond
illusions
of
her
youth
and
even
the
promises
of
love
that
capitan
tiago
had
in
other
days
whispered
in
her
ear
or
sung
in
some
serenade
late
it
is
true
had
the
dream
been
realized
but
doña
victorina
who
although
she
spoke
the
language
badly
was
more
spanish
than
augustina
of
saragossa
understood
the
proverb
better
late
than
never
and
found
consolation
in
repeating
it
to
herself
absolute
happiness
does
not
exist
on
earth
was
another
favorite
proverb
of
hers
but
she
never
used
both
together
before
other
persons
having
passed
her
first
second
third
and
fourth
youth
in
casting
her
nets
in
the
sea
of
the
world
for
the
object
of
her
vigils
she
had
been
compelled
at
last
to
content
herself
with
what
fate
was
willing
to
apportion
her
had
the
poor
woman
been
only
thirty
and
one
instead
of
thirty
and
two
summers
the
difference
according
to
her
mode
of
reckoning
was
great
she
would
have
restored
to
destiny
the
award
it
offered
her
to
wait
for
another
more
suited
to
her
taste
but
since
man
proposes
and
necessity
disposes
she
saw
herself
obliged
in
her
great
need
for
a
husband
to
content
herself
with
a
poor
fellow
who
had
been
cast
out
from
estremadura
and
who
after
wandering
about
the
world
for
six
or
seven
years
like
a
modern
ulysses
had
at
last
found
on
the
island
of
luzon
hospitality
and
a
withered
calypso
for
his
better
half
this
unhappy
mortal
by
name
tiburcio
espadaña
was
only
years
of
age
and
looked
like
an
old
man
yet
he
was
nevertheless
younger
than
doña
victorina
who
was
only
the
reason
for
this
is
easy
to
understand
but
dangerous
to
state
don
tiburcio
had
come
to
the
philippines
as
a
petty
official
in
the
customs
but
such
had
been
his
bad
luck
that
besides
suffering
severely
from
seasickness
and
breaking
a
leg
during
the
voyage
he
had
been
dismissed
within
a
fortnight
just
at
the
time
when
he
found
himself
without
a
cuarto
after
his
rough
experience
on
the
sea
he
did
not
care
to
return
to
spain
without
having
made
his
fortune
so
he
decided
to
devote
himself
to
something
spanish
pride
forbade
him
to
engage
in
manual
labor
although
the
poor
fellow
would
gladly
have
done
any
kind
of
work
in
order
to
earn
an
honest
living
but
the
prestige
of
the
spaniards
would
not
have
allowed
it
even
though
this
prestige
did
not
protect
him
from
want
at
first
he
had
lived
at
the
expense
of
some
of
his
countrymen
but
in
his
honesty
the
bread
tasted
bitter
so
instead
of
getting
fat
he
grew
thin
since
he
had
neither
learning
nor
money
nor
recommendations
he
was
advised
by
his
countrymen
who
wished
to
get
rid
of
him
to
go
to
the
provinces
and
pass
himself
off
as
a
doctor
of
medicine
he
refused
at
first
for
he
had
learned
nothing
during
the
short
period
that
he
had
spent
as
an
attendant
in
a
hospital
his
duties
there
having
been
to
dust
off
the
benches
and
light
the
fires
but
as
his
wants
were
pressing
and
as
his
scruples
were
soon
laid
to
rest
by
his
friends
he
finally
listened
to
them
and
went
to
the
provinces
he
began
by
visiting
some
sick
persons
and
at
first
made
only
moderate
charges
as
his
conscience
dictated
but
later
like
the
young
philosopher
of
whom
samaniego
tells
he
ended
by
putting
a
higher
price
on
his
visits
thus
he
soon
passed
for
a
great
physician
and
would
probably
have
made
his
fortune
if
the
medical
authorities
in
manila
had
not
heard
of
his
exorbitant
fees
and
the
competition
that
he
was
causing
others
both
private
parties
and
professionals
interceded
for
him
man
they
said
to
the
zealous
medical
official
let
him
make
his
stake
and
as
soon
as
he
has
six
or
seven
thousand
pesos
he
can
go
back
home
and
live
there
in
peace
after
all
what
does
it
matter
to
you
if
he
does
deceive
the
unwary
indians
they
should
be
more
careful
he
a
poor
devil
do
take
the
bread
from
his
mouth
be
a
good
spaniard
this
official
was
a
good
spaniard
and
agreed
to
wink
at
the
matter
but
the
news
soon
reached
the
ears
of
the
people
and
they
began
to
distrust
him
so
in
a
little
while
he
lost
his
practise
and
again
saw
himself
obliged
almost
to
beg
his
daily
bread
it
was
then
that
he
learned
through
a
friend
who
was
an
intimate
acquaintance
of
doña
victorina
of
the
dire
straits
in
which
that
lady
was
placed
and
also
of
her
patriotism
and
her
kind
heart
don
tiburcio
then
saw
a
patch
of
blue
sky
and
asked
to
be
introduced
to
her
doña
victorina
and
don
tiburcio
met
venientibus
he
would
have
exclaimed
had
he
known
latin
she
was
no
longer
passable
she
was
passée
her
abundant
hair
had
been
reduced
to
a
knot
about
the
size
of
an
onion
according
to
her
maid
while
her
face
was
furrowed
with
wrinkles
and
her
teeth
were
falling
loose
her
eyes
too
had
suffered
considerably
so
that
she
squinted
frequently
in
looking
any
distance
her
disposition
was
the
only
part
of
her
that
remained
intact
at
the
end
of
a
conversation
they
understood
and
accepted
each
other
she
would
have
preferred
a
spaniard
who
was
less
lame
less
stuttering
less
bald
less
toothless
who
slobbered
less
when
he
talked
and
who
had
more
spirit
and
quality
as
she
used
to
say
but
that
class
of
spaniards
no
longer
came
to
seek
her
hand
she
had
more
than
once
heard
it
said
that
opportunity
is
pictured
as
being
bald
and
firmly
believed
that
don
tiburcio
was
opportunity
itself
for
as
a
result
of
his
misfortunes
he
suffered
from
premature
baldness
and
what
woman
is
not
prudent
at
years
of
age
don
tiburcio
for
his
part
felt
a
vague
melancholy
when
he
thought
of
his
honeymoon
but
smiled
with
resignation
and
called
to
his
support
the
specter
of
hunger
never
had
he
been
ambitious
or
pretentious
his
tastes
were
simple
and
his
desires
limited
but
his
heart
untouched
till
then
had
dreamed
of
a
very
different
divinity
back
there
in
his
youth
when
worn
out
with
work
he
lay
doom
on
his
rough
bed
after
a
frugal
meal
he
used
to
fall
asleep
dreaming
of
an
image
smiling
and
tender
afterwards
when
troubles
and
privations
increased
and
with
the
passing
of
years
the
poetical
image
failed
to
materialize
he
thought
modestly
of
a
good
woman
diligent
and
industrious
who
would
bring
him
a
small
dowry
to
console
him
for
the
fatigues
of
his
toil
and
to
quarrel
with
him
now
and
then
yes
he
had
thought
of
quarrels
as
a
kind
of
happiness
but
when
obliged
to
wander
from
land
to
land
in
search
not
so
much
of
fortune
as
of
some
simple
means
of
livelihood
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
when
deluded
by
the
stories
of
his
countrymen
from
overseas
he
had
set
out
for
the
philippines
realism
gave
place
to
an
arrogant
mestiza
or
a
beautiful
indian
with
big
black
eyes
gowned
in
silks
and
transparent
draperies
loaded
down
with
gold
and
diamonds
offering
him
her
love
her
carriages
her
all
when
he
reached
manila
he
thought
for
a
time
that
his
dream
was
to
be
realized
for
the
young
women
whom
he
saw
driving
on
the
luneta
and
the
malecon
in
carriages
had
gazed
at
him
with
some
curiosity
then
after
his
position
was
gone
the
mestiza
and
the
indian
disappeared
and
with
great
effort
he
forced
before
himself
the
image
of
a
widow
of
course
an
agreeable
widow
so
when
he
saw
his
dream
take
shape
in
part
he
became
sad
but
with
a
certain
touch
of
native
philosophy
said
to
himself
those
were
all
dreams
and
in
this
world
one
does
not
live
on
dreams
thus
he
dispelled
his
doubts
she
used
but
after
their
marriage
he
would
break
her
of
the
habit
her
face
had
many
wrinkles
but
his
coat
was
torn
and
patched
she
was
a
pretentious
old
woman
domineering
and
mannish
but
hunger
was
more
terrible
more
domineering
and
pretentious
still
and
anyway
he
had
been
blessed
with
a
mild
disposition
for
that
very
end
and
love
softens
the
character
she
spoke
spanish
badly
but
he
himself
did
not
talk
it
well
as
he
had
been
told
when
notified
of
his
dismissal
moreover
what
did
it
matter
to
him
if
she
was
an
ugly
and
ridiculous
old
woman
he
was
lame
toothless
and
bald
don
tiburcio
preferred
to
take
charge
of
her
rather
than
to
become
a
public
charge
from
hunger
when
some
friends
joked
with
him
about
it
he
answered
give
me
bread
and
call
me
a
fool
don
tiburcio
was
one
of
those
men
who
are
popularly
spoken
of
as
unwilling
to
harm
a
fly
modest
incapable
of
harboring
an
unkind
thought
in
bygone
days
he
would
have
been
made
a
missionary
his
stay
in
the
country
had
not
given
him
the
conviction
of
grand
superiority
of
great
valor
and
of
elevated
importance
that
the
greater
part
of
his
countrymen
acquire
in
a
few
weeks
his
heart
had
never
been
capable
of
entertaining
hate
nor
had
he
been
able
to
find
a
single
filibuster
he
saw
only
unhappy
wretches
whom
he
must
despoil
if
he
did
not
wish
to
be
more
unhappy
than
they
were
when
he
was
threatened
with
prosecution
for
passing
himself
off
as
a
physician
he
was
not
resentful
nor
did
he
complain
recognizing
the
justness
of
the
charge
against
him
he
merely
answered
but
it
necessary
to
live
so
they
married
or
rather
bagged
each
other
and
went
to
santa
ann
to
spend
their
honeymoon
but
on
their
doña
victorina
was
attacked
by
a
horrible
indigestion
and
don
tiburcio
thanked
god
and
showed
himself
solicitous
and
attentive
a
few
days
afterward
however
he
looked
into
a
mirror
and
smiled
a
sad
smile
as
he
gazed
at
his
naked
gums
for
he
had
aged
ten
years
at
least
very
well
satisfied
with
her
husband
doña
victorina
had
a
fine
set
of
false
teeth
made
for
him
and
called
in
the
best
tailors
of
the
city
to
attend
to
his
clothing
she
ordered
carriages
sent
to
batangas
and
albay
for
the
best
ponies
and
even
obliged
him
to
keep
a
pair
for
the
races
nor
did
she
neglect
her
own
person
while
she
was
transforming
him
she
laid
aside
the
native
costume
for
the
european
and
substituted
false
frizzes
for
the
simple
filipino
coiffure
while
her
gowns
which
fitted
her
marvelously
ill
disturbed
the
peace
of
all
the
quiet
neighborhood
her
husband
who
never
went
out
on
foot
she
did
not
care
to
have
his
lameness
noticed
took
her
on
lonely
drives
in
unfrequented
places
to
her
great
sorrow
for
she
wanted
to
show
him
off
in
public
but
she
kept
quiet
out
of
respect
for
their
honeymoon
the
last
quarter
was
coming
on
when
he
took
up
the
subject
of
the
telling
her
that
the
use
of
it
was
false
and
unnatural
doña
victorina
wrinkled
up
her
eyebrows
and
stared
at
his
false
teeth
he
became
silent
and
she
understood
his
weakness
she
placed
a
before
her
husband
surname
since
the
cost
nothing
and
gave
quality
to
the
name
signing
herself
victorina
de
los
reyes
de
espadaña
this
was
such
a
mania
with
her
that
neither
the
stationer
nor
her
husband
could
get
it
out
of
her
head
if
i
write
only
one
it
may
be
thought
that
you
do
have
it
you
fool
she
said
to
her
husband
soon
she
believed
that
she
was
about
to
become
a
mother
so
she
announced
to
all
her
acquaintances
next
month
de
espadaña
and
i
are
going
to
the
i
do
want
our
son
to
be
born
here
and
be
called
a
revolutionist
she
talked
incessantly
of
the
journey
having
memorized
the
names
of
the
different
ports
of
call
so
that
it
was
a
treat
to
hear
her
talk
i
going
to
see
the
isthmus
in
the
suez
canal
de
espadaña
thinks
it
very
beautiful
and
de
espadaña
has
traveled
over
the
whole
world
i
probably
not
return
to
this
land
of
savages
i
was
born
to
live
here
aden
or
port
said
would
suit
me
better
i
thought
so
ever
since
i
was
a
girl
in
her
geography
doña
victorina
divided
the
world
into
the
philippines
and
spain
rather
differently
from
the
clever
people
who
divide
it
into
spain
and
america
or
china
for
another
name
her
husband
realized
that
these
things
were
barbarisms
but
held
his
peace
to
escape
a
scolding
or
reminders
of
his
stuttering
to
increase
the
illusion
of
approaching
maternity
she
became
whimsical
dressed
herself
in
colors
with
a
profusion
of
flowers
and
ribbons
and
appeared
on
the
escolta
in
a
wrapper
but
oh
the
disenchantment
three
months
went
by
and
the
dream
faded
and
now
having
no
reason
for
fearing
that
her
son
would
be
a
revolutionist
she
gave
up
the
trip
she
consulted
doctors
midwives
old
women
but
all
in
vain
having
to
the
great
displeasure
of
capitan
tiago
jested
about
pascual
bailon
she
was
unwilling
to
appeal
to
any
saint
for
this
reason
a
friend
of
her
husband
remarked
to
her
believe
me
señora
you
are
the
only
person
in
this
tiresome
country
she
had
smiled
without
knowing
what
meant
but
that
night
she
asked
her
husband
my
dear
he
answered
the
that
i
know
of
is
ammonia
my
must
have
after
that
she
would
say
on
every
possible
occasion
i
the
only
ammonia
in
this
tiresome
country
speaking
figuratively
so
señor
de
a
peninsular
gentleman
of
quality
told
me
whatever
she
said
had
to
be
done
for
she
had
succeeded
in
dominating
her
husband
completely
he
on
his
part
did
not
put
up
any
great
resistance
and
so
was
converted
into
a
kind
of
of
hers
if
she
was
displeased
with
him
she
would
not
let
him
go
out
and
when
she
was
really
angry
she
tore
out
his
false
teeth
thus
leaving
him
a
horrible
sight
for
several
days
it
soon
occurred
to
her
that
her
husband
ought
to
be
a
doctor
of
medicine
and
surgery
and
she
so
informed
him
my
dear
do
you
me
to
be
arrested
he
asked
fearfully
do
be
a
fool
leave
me
to
arrange
it
she
answered
not
going
to
treat
any
one
but
i
want
people
to
call
you
and
me
see
so
on
the
following
day
rodoreda
received
an
order
to
engrave
on
a
slab
of
black
marble
de
espadaña
specialist
in
all
kinds
of
diseases
all
the
servants
had
to
address
them
by
their
new
titles
and
as
a
result
she
increased
the
number
of
frizzes
the
layers
of
the
ribbons
and
laces
and
gazed
with
more
disdain
than
ever
on
her
poor
and
unfortunate
countrywomen
whose
husbands
belonged
to
a
lower
grade
of
society
than
hers
did
day
by
day
she
felt
more
dignified
and
exalted
and
by
continuing
in
this
way
at
the
end
of
a
year
she
would
have
believed
herself
to
be
of
divine
origin
these
sublime
thoughts
however
did
not
keep
her
from
becoming
older
and
more
ridiculous
every
day
every
time
capitan
tiago
saw
her
and
recalled
having
made
love
to
her
in
vain
he
forthwith
sent
a
peso
to
the
church
for
a
mass
of
thanksgiving
still
he
greatly
respected
her
husband
on
account
of
his
title
of
specialist
in
all
kinds
of
diseases
and
listened
attentively
to
the
few
phrases
that
he
was
able
to
stutter
out
for
this
reason
and
because
this
doctor
was
more
exclusive
than
others
capitan
tiago
had
selected
him
to
treat
his
daughter
in
regard
to
young
linares
that
is
another
matter
when
arranging
for
the
trip
to
spain
doña
victorina
had
thought
of
having
a
peninsular
administrator
as
she
did
not
trust
the
filipinos
her
husband
bethought
himself
of
a
nephew
of
his
in
madrid
who
was
studying
law
and
who
was
considered
the
brightest
of
the
family
so
they
wrote
to
him
paying
his
passage
in
advance
and
when
the
dream
disappeared
he
was
already
on
his
way
such
were
the
three
persons
who
had
just
arrived
while
they
were
partaking
of
a
late
breakfast
padre
salvi
came
in
the
espadañas
were
already
acquainted
with
him
and
they
introduced
the
blushing
young
linares
with
all
his
titles
as
was
natural
they
talked
of
maria
clara
who
was
resting
and
sleeping
they
talked
of
their
journey
and
doña
victorina
exhibited
all
her
verbosity
in
criticising
the
customs
of
the
provincials
their
nipa
houses
their
bamboo
bridges
without
forgetting
to
mention
to
the
curate
her
intimacy
with
this
and
that
high
official
and
other
persons
of
quality
who
were
very
fond
of
her
if
you
had
come
two
days
ago
doña
victorina
put
in
capitan
tiago
during
a
slight
pause
you
would
have
met
his
excellency
the
he
sat
right
there
what
how
that
his
excellency
here
in
your
house
no
i
tell
you
that
he
sat
right
there
if
you
had
only
come
two
days
ago
ah
what
a
pity
that
clarita
did
not
get
sick
sooner
she
exclaimed
with
real
feeling
then
turning
to
linares
do
you
hear
cousin
his
excellency
was
here
do
you
see
now
that
de
espadaña
was
right
when
he
told
you
that
you
were
going
to
the
house
of
a
miserable
indian
because
you
know
don
santiago
in
madrid
our
cousin
was
the
friend
of
ministers
and
dukes
and
dined
in
the
house
of
count
el
campanario
the
duke
of
la
torte
victorina
corrected
her
husband
it
the
same
thing
if
you
will
tell
me
shall
i
find
padre
damaso
in
his
town
interrupted
linares
addressing
padre
salvi
i
been
told
that
it
near
here
he
right
here
and
will
be
over
in
a
little
while
replied
the
curate
how
glad
i
am
of
that
i
have
a
letter
to
him
exclaimed
the
youth
and
if
it
were
not
for
the
happy
chance
that
brings
me
here
i
would
have
come
expressly
to
visit
him
in
the
meantime
the
chance
had
awakened
de
espadaña
said
doña
victorina
when
the
meal
was
over
shall
we
go
in
to
see
clarita
then
to
capitan
tiago
only
for
you
don
santiago
only
for
you
my
husband
only
attends
persons
of
quality
and
yet
and
yet
he
not
like
those
here
in
madrid
he
only
visited
persons
of
quality
they
adjourned
to
the
sick
girl
chamber
the
windows
were
closed
from
fear
of
a
draught
so
the
room
was
almost
dark
being
only
dimly
illuminated
by
two
tapers
which
burned
before
an
image
of
the
virgin
of
antipolo
her
head
covered
with
a
handkerchief
saturated
in
cologne
her
body
wrapped
carefully
in
white
sheets
which
swathed
her
youthful
form
with
many
folds
under
curtains
of
jusi
and
piña
the
girl
lay
on
her
kamagon
bed
her
hair
formed
a
frame
around
her
oval
countenance
and
accentuated
her
transparent
paleness
which
was
enlivened
only
by
her
large
sad
eyes
at
her
side
were
her
two
friends
and
andeng
with
a
bouquet
of
tuberoses
de
espadaña
felt
her
pulse
examined
her
tongue
asked
a
few
questions
and
said
as
he
wagged
his
head
from
side
to
side
but
be
doña
victorina
looked
proudly
at
the
bystanders
lichen
with
milk
in
the
morning
syrup
of
marshmallow
two
cynoglossum
pills
ordered
de
espadaña
cheer
up
clarita
said
doña
victorina
going
up
to
her
come
to
cure
you
i
want
to
introduce
our
cousin
linares
was
so
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
those
eloquent
eyes
which
seemed
to
be
searching
for
some
one
that
he
did
not
hear
doña
victorina
name
him
señor
linares
said
the
curate
calling
him
out
of
his
abstraction
here
comes
padre
damaso
it
was
indeed
padre
damaso
but
pale
and
rather
sad
on
leaving
his
bed
his
first
visit
was
for
maria
clara
nor
was
it
the
padre
damaso
of
former
times
hearty
and
now
he
moved
silently
and
with
some
hesitation
chapter
xliii
plans
without
heeding
any
of
the
bystanders
padre
damaso
went
directly
to
the
bed
of
the
sick
girl
and
taking
her
hand
said
to
her
with
ineffable
tenderness
while
tears
sprang
into
his
eyes
maria
my
daughter
you
must
die
the
sick
girl
opened
her
eyes
and
stared
at
him
with
a
strange
expression
no
one
who
knew
the
franciscan
had
suspected
in
him
such
tender
feelings
no
one
had
believed
that
under
his
rude
and
rough
exterior
there
might
beat
a
heart
unable
to
go
on
he
withdrew
from
the
girl
side
weeping
like
a
child
and
went
outside
under
the
favorite
vines
of
maria
clara
balcony
to
give
free
rein
to
his
grief
how
he
loves
his
goddaughter
thought
all
present
while
fray
salvi
gazed
at
him
motionlessly
and
in
silence
lightly
gnawing
his
lips
the
while
when
he
had
become
somewhat
calm
again
doña
victorina
introduced
linares
who
approached
him
respectfully
fray
damaso
silently
looked
him
over
from
head
to
foot
took
the
letter
offered
and
read
it
but
apparently
without
understanding
for
he
asked
and
who
are
you
alfonso
linares
the
godson
of
your
stammered
the
young
man
padre
damaso
threw
back
his
body
and
looked
the
youth
over
again
carefully
then
his
features
lighted
up
and
he
arose
so
you
are
the
godson
of
carlicos
he
exclaimed
come
and
let
me
embrace
you
i
got
your
letter
several
days
ago
so
it
you
i
did
recognize
you
which
is
easily
explained
for
you
were
born
when
i
left
the
country
i
did
recognize
you
padre
damaso
squeezed
his
robust
arms
about
the
young
man
who
became
very
red
whether
from
modesty
or
lack
of
breath
is
not
known
after
the
first
moments
of
effusion
had
passed
and
inquiries
about
carlicos
and
his
wife
had
been
made
and
answered
padre
damaso
asked
come
now
what
does
carlicos
want
me
to
do
for
you
i
believe
he
says
something
about
that
in
the
letter
linares
again
stammered
in
the
letter
let
see
that
right
he
wants
me
to
get
you
a
job
and
a
wife
ahem
a
job
a
job
that
easy
can
you
read
and
write
i
received
my
degree
of
law
from
the
university
so
you
a
pettifogger
you
do
show
it
you
look
more
like
a
shy
maiden
so
much
the
better
but
to
get
you
a
wife
padre
i
not
in
such
a
great
hurry
interrupted
linares
in
confusion
but
padre
damaso
was
already
pacing
from
one
end
of
the
hallway
to
the
other
muttering
a
wife
a
wife
his
countenance
was
no
longer
sad
or
merry
but
now
wore
an
expression
of
great
seriousness
while
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
deeply
padre
salvi
gazed
on
the
scene
from
a
distance
i
did
think
that
the
matter
would
trouble
me
so
much
murmured
padre
damaso
in
a
tearful
voice
but
of
two
evils
the
lesser
then
raising
his
voice
he
approached
linares
and
said
to
him
come
boy
let
talk
to
santiago
linares
turned
pale
and
allowed
himself
to
be
dragged
along
by
the
priest
who
moved
thoughtfully
then
it
was
padre
salvi
turn
to
pace
back
and
forth
pensive
as
ever
a
voice
wishing
him
good
morning
drew
him
from
his
monotonous
walk
he
raised
his
head
and
saw
lucas
who
saluted
him
humbly
what
do
you
want
questioned
the
curate
eyes
padre
i
the
brother
of
the
man
who
was
killed
on
the
day
of
the
fiesta
began
lucas
in
tearful
accents
the
curate
recoiled
and
murmured
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
well
lucas
made
an
effort
to
weep
and
wiped
his
eyes
with
a
handkerchief
padre
he
went
on
tearfully
i
been
to
don
crisostomo
to
ask
for
an
indemnity
first
he
received
me
with
kicks
saying
that
he
would
pay
anything
since
he
himself
had
run
the
risk
of
getting
killed
through
the
fault
of
my
dear
unfortunate
brother
i
went
to
talk
to
him
yesterday
but
he
had
gone
to
manila
he
left
me
five
hundred
pesos
for
charity
sake
and
charged
me
not
to
come
back
again
ah
padre
five
hundred
pesos
for
my
poor
brother
five
hundred
pesos
ah
padre
at
first
the
curate
had
listened
with
surprise
and
attention
while
his
lips
curled
slightly
with
a
smile
of
such
disdain
and
sarcasm
at
the
sight
of
this
farce
that
had
lucas
noticed
it
he
would
have
run
away
at
top
speed
now
what
do
you
want
he
asked
turning
away
ah
padre
tell
me
for
the
love
of
god
what
i
ought
to
do
the
padre
has
always
given
good
advice
who
told
you
so
you
do
belong
in
these
parts
the
padre
is
known
all
over
the
province
with
irritated
looks
padre
salvi
approached
him
and
pointing
to
the
street
said
to
the
now
startled
lucas
go
home
and
be
thankful
that
don
crisostomo
did
have
you
sent
to
jail
get
out
of
here
lucas
forgot
the
part
he
was
playing
and
murmured
but
i
thought
get
out
of
here
cried
padre
salvi
nervously
i
would
like
to
see
padre
damaso
padre
damaso
is
busy
get
out
of
here
again
ordered
the
curate
imperiously
lucas
went
down
the
stairway
muttering
he
another
of
them
as
he
does
pay
well
the
one
who
pays
best
at
the
sound
of
the
curate
voice
all
had
hurried
to
the
spot
including
padre
damaso
capitan
tiago
and
linares
an
insolent
vagabond
who
came
to
beg
and
who
does
want
to
work
explained
padre
salvi
picking
up
his
hat
and
cane
to
return
to
the
convento
chapter
xliv
an
examination
of
conscience
long
days
and
weary
nights
passed
at
the
sick
girl
bed
after
having
confessed
herself
maria
clara
had
suffered
a
relapse
and
in
her
delirium
she
uttered
only
the
name
of
the
mother
whom
she
had
never
known
but
her
girl
friends
her
father
and
her
aunt
kept
watch
at
her
side
offerings
and
alms
were
sent
to
all
the
miraculous
images
capitan
tiago
vowed
a
gold
cane
to
the
virgin
of
antipolo
and
at
length
the
fever
began
to
subside
slowly
and
regularly
doctor
de
espadaña
was
astonished
at
the
virtues
of
the
syrup
of
marshmallow
and
the
infusion
of
lichen
prescriptions
that
he
had
not
varied
doña
victorina
was
so
pleased
with
her
husband
that
one
day
when
he
stepped
on
the
train
of
her
gown
she
did
not
apply
her
penal
code
to
the
extent
of
taking
his
set
of
false
teeth
away
from
him
but
contented
herself
with
merely
exclaiming
if
you
were
lame
you
even
step
on
my
corset
an
article
of
apparel
she
did
not
wear
one
afternoon
while
sinang
and
victoria
were
visiting
their
friend
the
curate
capitan
tiago
and
doña
victorina
family
were
conversing
over
their
lunch
in
the
well
i
feel
very
sorry
about
it
said
the
doctor
padre
damaso
also
will
regret
it
very
much
where
do
you
say
they
transferring
him
to
linares
asked
the
curate
to
the
province
of
tayabas
replied
the
curate
negligently
one
who
will
be
greatly
affected
by
it
is
maria
clara
when
she
learns
of
it
said
capitan
tiago
she
loves
him
like
a
father
fray
salvi
looked
at
him
askance
i
believe
padre
continued
capitan
tiago
that
all
her
illness
is
the
result
of
the
trouble
on
the
last
day
of
the
fiesta
i
of
the
same
opinion
and
think
that
you
done
well
not
to
let
señor
ibarra
see
her
she
would
have
got
worse
if
it
was
for
us
put
in
doña
victorina
clarita
would
already
be
in
heaven
singing
praises
to
god
amen
capitan
tiago
thought
it
his
duty
to
exclaim
it
lucky
for
you
that
my
husband
did
have
any
patient
of
greater
quality
for
then
you
have
had
to
call
in
another
and
all
those
here
are
ignoramuses
my
husband
just
as
i
was
saying
the
curate
in
turn
interrupted
i
think
that
the
confession
that
maria
clara
made
brought
on
the
favorable
crisis
which
has
saved
her
life
a
clean
conscience
is
worth
more
than
a
lot
of
medicine
do
think
that
i
deny
the
power
of
science
above
all
that
of
surgery
but
a
clean
conscience
read
the
pious
books
and
you
see
how
many
cures
are
effected
merely
by
a
clean
confession
pardon
me
objected
the
piqued
doña
victorina
this
power
of
the
confessional
cure
the
alferez
woman
with
a
confession
a
wound
madam
is
not
a
form
of
illness
which
the
conscience
can
affect
replied
padre
salvi
severely
nevertheless
a
clean
confession
will
preserve
her
from
receiving
in
the
future
such
blows
as
she
got
this
morning
she
deserves
them
went
on
doña
victorina
as
if
she
had
not
heard
what
padre
salvi
said
that
woman
is
so
insolent
in
the
church
she
did
nothing
but
stare
at
me
you
can
see
that
she
a
nobody
sunday
i
was
going
to
ask
her
if
she
saw
anything
funny
about
my
face
but
who
would
lower
oneself
to
speak
to
people
that
are
not
of
rank
the
curate
on
his
part
continued
just
as
though
he
had
not
heard
this
tirade
believe
me
don
santiago
to
complete
your
recovery
it
necessary
that
she
take
communion
tomorrow
i
bring
the
viaticum
over
here
i
do
think
she
has
anything
to
confess
but
yet
if
she
wants
to
confess
herself
tonight
i
do
know
doña
victorina
instantly
took
advantage
of
a
slight
hesitation
on
padre
salvi
part
to
add
i
do
understand
how
there
can
be
men
capable
of
marrying
such
a
fright
as
that
woman
is
it
easily
seen
where
she
comes
from
she
just
dying
of
envy
you
can
see
it
how
much
does
an
alferez
get
accordingly
don
santiago
tell
your
cousin
to
prepare
the
sick
girl
for
the
communion
tomorrow
i
come
over
tonight
to
absolve
her
of
her
peccadillos
seeing
aunt
isabel
come
from
the
he
said
to
her
in
tagalog
prepare
your
niece
for
confession
tonight
tomorrow
i
bring
over
the
viaticum
with
that
she
improve
faster
but
padre
linares
gathered
up
enough
courage
to
ask
faintly
you
do
think
that
she
in
any
danger
of
dying
do
you
worry
answered
the
padre
without
looking
at
him
i
know
what
i
doing
i
helped
take
care
of
plenty
of
sick
people
before
besides
she
decide
herself
whether
or
not
she
wishes
to
receive
the
holy
communion
and
you
see
that
she
says
yes
capitan
tiago
immediately
agreed
to
everything
while
aunt
isabel
returned
to
the
sick
girl
chamber
maria
clara
was
still
in
bed
pale
very
pale
and
at
her
side
were
her
two
friends
take
one
more
grain
sinang
whispered
as
she
offered
her
a
white
tablet
that
she
took
from
a
small
glass
tube
he
says
that
when
you
feel
a
rumbling
or
buzzing
in
your
ears
you
are
to
stop
the
medicine
has
he
written
to
you
again
asked
the
sick
girl
in
a
low
voice
no
he
must
be
very
busy
has
he
sent
any
message
he
says
nothing
more
than
that
he
going
to
try
to
get
the
archbishop
to
absolve
him
from
the
excommunication
so
that
this
conversation
was
suspended
at
the
aunt
approach
the
padre
says
for
you
to
get
ready
for
confession
daughter
said
the
latter
you
girls
must
leave
her
so
that
she
can
make
her
examination
of
conscience
but
it
has
been
a
week
since
she
confessed
protested

sick
and
i
do
sin
as
often
as
that
abá
do
you
know
what
the
curate
says
the
righteous
sin
seven
times
a
day

what
book

maria

did
not
answer
well
you
must
tire
yourself
added
the
good
aunt
to
console
her
i
read
the
examination
myself
and
you
have
only
to
recall
your
sins
write
to
him
not
to
think
of
me
any
more
murmured
maria
clara
in
sinang
ear
as
the
latter
said
to
her
what
but
the
aunt
again
approached
and
sinang
had
to
go
away
without
understanding
what
her
friend
had
meant
the
good
old
aunt
drew
a
chair
up
to
the
light
put
her
spectacles
on
the
end
of
her
nose
and
opened
a
booklet
pay
close
attention
daughter
i
going
to
begin
with
the
ten
commandments
i
go
slow
so
that
you
can
meditate
if
you
do
hear
well
tell
me
so
that
i
can
repeat
you
know
that
in
looking
after
your
welfare
i
never
weary
she
began
to
read
in
a
monotonous
and
snuffling
voice
the
considerations
of
cases
of
sinfulness
at
the
end
of
each
paragraph
she
made
a
long
pause
in
order
to
give
the
girl
time
to
recall
her
sins
and
to
repent
of
them
maria
clara
stared
vaguely
into
space
after
finishing
the
first
commandment
love
god
above
all
aunt
isabel
looked
at
her
over
her
spectacles
and
was
satisfied
with
her
sad
and
thoughtful
mien
she
coughed
piously
and
after
a
long
pause
began
to
read
the
second
commandment
the
good
old
woman
read
with
unction
and
when
she
had
finished
the
commentaries
looked
again
at
her
niece
who
turned
her
head
slowly
to
the
other
side
bah
said
aunt
isabel
to
herself
with
taking
his
holy
name
in
vain
the
poor
child
has
nothing
to
do
let
pass
on
to
the
third
the
third
commandment
was
analyzed
and
commented
upon
after
citing
all
the
cases
in
which
one
can
break
it
she
again
looked
toward
the
bed
but
now
she
lifted
up
her
glasses
and
rubbed
her
eyes
for
she
had
seen
her
niece
raise
a
handkerchief
to
her
face
as
if
to
wipe
away
tears
hum
ahem
the
poor
child
once
went
to
sleep
during
the
sermon
then
replacing
her
glasses
on
the
end
of
her
nose
she
said
now
see
if
just
as
you
failed
to
keep
holy
the
sabbath
you
failed
to
honor
your
father
and
mother
so
she
read
the
fourth
commandment
in
an
even
slower
and
more
snuffling
voice
thinking
thus
to
give
solemnity
to
the
act
just
as
she
had
seen
many
friars
do
aunt
isabel
had
never
heard
a
quaker
preach
or
she
would
also
have
trembled
the
sick
girl
in
the
meantime
raised
the
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
several
times
and
her
breathing
became
more
noticeable
what
a
good
soul
thought
the
old
woman
she
who
is
so
obedient
and
submissive
to
every
one
i
committed
more
sins
and
yet
never
been
able
really
to
cry
she
then
began
the
fifth
commandment
with
greater
pauses
and
even
more
pronounced
snuffling
if
that
were
possible
and
with
such
great
enthusiasm
that
she
did
not
hear
the
stifled
sobs
of
her
niece
only
in
a
pause
which
she
made
after
the
comments
on
homicide
by
violence
did
she
notice
the
groans
of
the
sinner
then
her
tone
passed
into
the
sublime
as
she
read
the
rest
of
the
commandment
in
accents
that
she
tried
to
reader
threatening
seeing
that
her
niece
was
still
weeping
weep
daughter
weep
she
said
approaching
the
bed
the
more
you
weep
the
sooner
god
will
pardon
you
hold
the
sorrow
of
repentance
as
better
than
that
of
mere
penitence
weep
daughter
weep
you
know
how
much
i
enjoy
seeing
you
weep
beat
yourself
on
the
breast
also
but
not
hard
for
you
still
sick
but
as
if
her
sorrow
needed
mystery
and
solitude
to
make
it
increase
maria
clara
on
seeing
herself
observed
little
by
little
stopped
sighing
and
dried
her
eyes
without
saying
anything
or
answering
her
aunt
who
continued
the
reading
since
the
wails
of
her
audience
had
ceased
however
she
lost
her
enthusiasm
and
the
last
commandments
made
her
so
sleepy
that
she
began
to
yawn
with
great
detriment
to
her
snuffling
which
was
thus
interrupted
if
i
had
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
i
would
have
believed
it
thought
the
good
old
lady
afterwards
this
girl
sins
like
a
soldier
against
the
first
five
and
from
the
sixth
to
the
tenth
not
a
venial
sin
just
the
opposite
to
us
how
the
world
does
move
now
so
she
lighted
a
large
candle
to
the
virgin
of
antipolo
and
two
other
smaller
ones
to
our
lady
of
the
rosary
and
our
lady
of
the
pillar
taking
care
to
put
away
in
a
corner
a
marble
crucifix
to
make
it
understand
that
the
candles
were
not
lighted
for
it
nor
did
the
virgin
of
delaroche
have
any
share
she
was
an
unknown
foreigner
and
aunt
isabel
had
never
heard
of
any
miracle
of
hers
we
do
not
know
what
occurred
during
the
confession
that
night
and
we
respect
such
secrets
but
the
confession
was
a
long
one
and
the
aunt
who
stood
watch
over
her
niece
at
a
distance
could
note
that
the
curate
instead
of
turning
his
ear
to
hear
the
words
of
the
sick
girl
rather
had
his
face
turned
toward
hers
and
seemed
only
to
be
trying
to
read
or
divine
her
thoughts
by
gazing
into
her
beautiful
eyes
pale
and
with
contracted
lips
padre
salvi
left
the
chamber
looking
at
his
forehead
which
was
gloomy
and
covered
with
perspiration
one
would
have
said
that
it
was
he
who
had
confessed
and
had
not
obtained
absolution

exclaimed
aunt
isabel
crossing
herself
to
dispel
an
evil
thought
who

the
hunted
in
the
dim
light
shed
by
the
moonbeams
sifting
through
the
thick
foliage
a
man
wandered
through
the
forest
with
slow
and
cautious
steps
from
time
to
time
as
if
to
find
his
way
he
whistled
a
peculiar
melody
which
was
answered
in
the
distance
by
some
one
whistling
the
same
air
the
man
would
listen
attentively
and
then
make
his
way
in
the
direction
of
the
distant
sound
until
at
length
after
overcoming
the
thousand
obstacles
offered
by
the
virgin
forest
in
the
he
reached
a
small
open
space
which
was
bathed
in
the
light
of
the
moon
in
its
first
quarter
the
high
rocks
that
rose
about
formed
a
kind
of
ruined
amphitheater
in
the
center
of
which
were
scattered
recently
felled
trees
and
charred
logs
among
boulders
covered
with
nature
mantle
of
verdure
scarcely
had
the
unknown
arrived
when
another
figure
started
suddenly
from
behind
a
large
rock
and
advanced
with
drawn
revolver
who
are
you
he
asked
in
tagalog
in
an
imperious
tone
cocking
the
weapon
is
old
pablo
among
you
inquired
the
unknown
in
an
even
tone
without
answering
the
question
or
showing
any
signs
of
fear
you
mean
the
capitan
yes
he
here
then
tell
him
that
elias
is
here
looking
for
him
was
the
answer
of
the
unknown
who
was
no
other
than
the
mysterious
pilot
are
you
elias
asked
the
other
respectfully
as
he
approached
him
not
however
ceasing
to
cover
him
with
the
revolver
then
come
elias
followed
him
and
they
penetrated
into
a
kind
of
cave
sunk
down
in
the
depths
of
the
earth
the
guide
who
seemed
to
be
familiar
with
the
way
warned
the
pilot
when
he
should
descend
or
turn
aside
or
stoop
down
so
they
were
not
long
in
reaching
a
kind
of
hall
which
was
poorly
lighted
by
pitch
torches
and
occupied
by
twelve
to
fifteen
armed
men
with
dirty
faces
and
soiled
clothing
some
seated
and
some
lying
down
as
they
talked
fitfully
to
one
another
resting
his
arms
on
a
stone
that
served
for
a
table
and
gazing
thoughtfully
at
the
torches
which
gave
out
so
little
light
for
so
much
smoke
was
seen
an
old
man
with
his
head
wrapped
in
a
bloody
bandage
did
we
not
know
that
it
was
a
den
of
tulisanes
we
might
have
said
on
reading
the
look
of
desperation
in
the
old
man
face
that
it
was
the
tower
of
hunger
on
the
eve
before
ugolino
devoured
his
sons
upon
the
arrival
of
elias
and
his
guide
the
figures
partly
rose
but
at
a
signal
from
the
latter
they
settled
back
again
satisfying
themselves
with
the
observation
that
the
newcomer
was
unarmed
the
old
man
turned
his
head
slowly
and
saw
the
quiet
figure
of
elias
who
stood
uncovered
gazing
at
him
with
sad
interest
it
you
at
last
murmured
the
old
man
his
gaze
lighting
up
somewhat
as
he
recognized
the
youth
in
what
condition
do
i
find
you
exclaimed
the
youth
in
a
suppressed
tone
shaking
his
head
the
old
man
dropped
his
head
in
silence
and
made
a
sign
to
the
others
who
arose
and
withdrew
first
taking
the
measure
of
the
muscles
and
stature
with
a
glance
yes
said
the
old
man
to
elias
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
six
months
ago
when
i
sheltered
you
in
my
house
it
was
i
who
pitied
you
now
we
have
changed
parts
and
it
is
you
who
pity
me
but
sit
down
and
tell
me
how
you
got
here
it
fifteen
days
now
since
i
was
told
of
your
misfortune
began
the
young
man
slowly
in
a
low
voice
as
he
stared
at
the
light
i
started
at
once
and
have
been
seeking
you
from
mountain
to
mountain
traveled
over
nearly
the
whole
of
two
provinces
in
order
not
to
shed
innocent
blood
continued
the
old
man
i
have
had
to
flee
my
enemies
were
afraid
to
show
themselves
i
was
confronted
merely
with
some
unfortunates
who
have
never
done
me
the
least
harm
after
a
brief
pause
during
which
he
seemed
to
be
occupied
in
trying
to
read
the
thoughts
in
the
dark
countenance
of
the
old
man
elias
replied
i
come
to
make
a
proposition
to
you
having
sought
in
vain
for
some
survivor
of
the
family
that
caused
the
misfortunes
of
mine
i
decided
to
leave
the
province
where
i
live
and
move
toward
the
north
among
the
independent
pagan
tribes
do
you
want
to
abandon
the
life
you
have
entered
upon
and
come
with
me
i
will
be
your
son
since
you
have
lost
your
own
i
have
no
family
and
in
you
will
find
a
father
the
old
man
shook
his
head
in
negation
saying
when
one
at
my
age
makes
a
desperate
resolution
it
because
there
is
no
other
recourse
a
man
who
like
myself
has
spent
his
youth
and
his
mature
years
toiling
for
the
future
of
himself
and
his
sons
a
man
who
has
been
submissive
to
every
wish
of
his
superiors
who
has
conscientiously
performed
difficult
tasks
enduring
all
that
he
might
live
in
peace
and
quiet
when
that
man
whose
blood
time
has
chilled
renounces
all
his
past
and
foregoes
all
his
future
even
on
the
very
brink
of
the
grave
it
is
because
he
has
with
mature
judgment
decided
that
peace
does
not
exist
and
that
it
is
not
the
highest
good
why
drag
out
miserable
days
on
foreign
soil
i
had
two
sons
a
daughter
a
home
a
fortune
i
was
esteemed
and
respected
now
i
am
as
a
tree
shorn
of
its
branches
a
wanderer
a
fugitive
hunted
like
a
wild
beast
through
the
forest
and
all
for
what
because
a
man
dishonored
my
daughter
because
her
brothers
called
that
man
infamy
to
account
and
because
that
man
is
set
above
his
fellows
with
the
title
of
minister
of
god
in
spite
of
everything
i
her
father
i
dishonored
in
my
old
age
forgave
the
injury
for
i
was
indulgent
with
the
passions
of
youth
and
the
weakness
of
the
flesh
and
in
the
face
of
irreparable
wrong
what
could
i
do
but
hold
my
peace
and
save
what
remained
to
me
but
the
culprit
fearful
of
vengeance
sooner
or
later
sought
the
destruction
of
my
sons
do
you
know
what
he
did
no
you
do
know
then
that
he
pretended
that
there
had
been
a
robbery
committed
in
the
convento
and
that
one
of
my
sons
figured
among
the
accused
the
other
could
not
be
included
because
he
was
in
another
place
at
the
time
do
you
know
what
tortures
they
were
subjected
to
you
know
of
them
for
they
are
the
same
in
all
the
towns
i
i
saw
my
son
hanging
by
the
hair
i
heard
his
cries
i
heard
him
call
upon
me
and
i
coward
and
lover
of
peace
had
the
courage
either
to
kill
or
to
die
do
you
know
that
the
theft
was
not
proved
that
it
was
shown
to
be
a
false
charge
and
that
in
punishment
the
curate
was
transferred
to
another
town
but
that
my
son
died
as
a
result
of
his
tortures
the
other
the
one
who
was
left
to
me
was
not
a
coward
like
his
father
so
our
persecutor
was
still
fearful
that
he
would
wreak
vengeance
on
him
and
under
the
pretext
of
his
not
having
his
cedula
which
he
had
not
carried
with
him
just
at
that
time
had
him
arrested
by
the
civil
guard
mistreated
him
enraged
and
harassed
him
with
insults
until
he
was
driven
to
suicide
and
i
i
have
outlived
so
much
shame
but
if
i
had
not
the
courage
of
a
father
to
defend
my
sons
there
yet
remains
to
me
a
heart
burning
for
revenge
and
i
will
have
it
the
discontented
are
gathering
under
my
command
my
enemies
increase
my
forces
and
on
the
day
that
i
feel
myself
strong
enough
i
will
descend
to
the
lowlands
and
in
flames
sate
my
vengeance
and
end
my
own
existence
and
that
day
will
come
or
there
is
no
god
the
old
man
arose
trembling
with
fiery
look
and
hollow
voice
he
added
tearing
his
long
hair
curses
curses
upon
me
that
i
restrained
the
avenging
hands
of
my
sons
i
have
murdered
them
had
i
let
the
guilty
perish
had
i
confided
less
in
the
justice
of
god
and
men
i
should
now
have
my
sons
fugitives
perhaps
but
i
should
have
them
they
would
not
have
died
under
torture
i
was
not
born
to
be
a
father
so
i
have
them
not
curses
upon
me
that
i
had
not
learned
with
my
years
to
know
the
conditions
under
which
i
lived
but
in
fire
and
blood
by
my
own
death
i
will
avenge
them
in
his
paroxysm
of
grief
the
unfortunate
father
tore
away
the
bandage
reopening
a
wound
in
his
forehead
from
which
gushed
a
stream
of
blood
i
respect
your
sorrow
said
elias
and
i
understand
your
desire
for
revenge
i
too
am
like
you
and
yet
from
fear
of
injuring
the
innocent
i
prefer
to
forget
my
misfortunes
you
can
forget
because
you
are
young
and
because
you
have
lost
a
son
your
last
hope
but
i
assure
you
that
i
shall
injure
no
innocent
one
do
you
see
this
wound
rather
than
kill
a
poor
cuadrillero
who
was
doing
his
duty
i
let
him
inflict
it
but
look
urged
elias
after
a
moment
silence
look
what
a
frightful
catastrophe
you
are
going
to
bring
down
upon
our
unfortunate
people
if
you
accomplish
your
revenge
by
your
own
hand
your
enemies
will
make
terrible
reprisals
not
against
you
not
against
those
who
are
armed
but
against
the
peaceful
who
as
usual
will
be
accused
and
then
the
eases
of
injustice
let
the
people
learn
to
defend
themselves
let
each
one
defend
himself
you
know
that
that
is
impossible
sir
i
knew
you
in
other
days
when
you
were
happy
then
you
gave
me
good
advice
will
you
now
permit
me
the
old
man
folded
his
arms
in
an
attitude
of
attention
sir
continued
elias
weighing
his
words
well
i
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
render
a
service
to
a
young
man
who
is
rich
generous
noble
and
who
desires
the
welfare
of
his
country
they
say
that
this
young
man
has
friends
in
madrid
i
do
know
myself
but
i
can
assure
you
that
he
is
a
friend
of
the
what
do
you
say
that
we
make
him
the
bearer
of
the
people
complaints
if
we
interest
him
in
the
cause
of
the
unhappy
the
old
man
shook
his
head
you
say
that
he
is
rich
the
rich
think
only
of
increasing
their
wealth
pride
and
show
blind
them
and
as
they
are
generally
safe
above
all
when
they
have
powerful
friends
none
of
them
troubles
himself
about
the
woes
of
the
unfortunate
i
know
all
because
i
was
rich
but
the
man
of
whom
i
speak
is
not
like
the
others
he
is
a
son
who
has
been
insulted
over
the
memory
of
his
father
and
a
young
man
who
as
he
is
soon
to
have
a
family
thinks
of
the
future
of
a
happy
future
for
his
children
then
he
is
a
man
who
is
going
to
be
happy
our
cause
is
not
for
happy
men
but
it
is
for
men
who
have
feelings
perhaps
replied
the
old
man
seating
himself
suppose
that
he
agrees
to
carry
our
cry
even
to
the
suppose
that
he
finds
in
the
cortes
delegates
who
will
plead
for
us
do
you
think
that
we
shall
get
justice
let
us
try
it
before
we
resort
to
violent
measure
answered
elias
you
must
be
surprised
that
i
another
unfortunate
young
and
strong
should
propose
to
you
old
and
weak
peaceful
measures
but
it
because
i
seen
as
much
misery
caused
by
us
as
by
the
tyrants
the
defenseless
are
the
ones
who
pay
and
if
we
accomplish
nothing
something
we
shall
accomplish
believe
me
for
all
those
who
are
in
power
are
not
unjust
but
if
we
accomplish
nothing
if
they
disregard
our
entreaties
if
man
has
become
deaf
to
the
cry
of
sorrow
from
his
kind
then
i
will
put
myself
under
your
orders
the
old
man
embraced
the
youth
enthusiastically
i
accept
your
proposition
elias
i
know
that
you
will
keep
your
word
you
will
come
to
me
and
i
shall
help
you
to
revenge
your
ancestors
you
will
help
me
to
revenge
my
sons
my
sons
that
were
like
you
in
the
meantime
sir
you
will
refrain
from
violent
measures
you
will
present
the
complaints
of
the
people
you
know
them
when
shall
i
know
your
answer
in
four
days
send
a
man
to
the
beach
at
san
diego
and
i
will
tell
him
what
i
shall
have
learned
from
the
person
in
whom
i
place
so
much
hope
if
he
accepts
they
will
give
us
justice
and
if
not
i
be
the
first
to
fall
in
the
struggle
that
we
will
begin
elias
will
not
die
elias
will
be
the
leader
when
capitan
pablo
fails
satisfied
in
his
revenge
concluded
the
old
man
as
he
accompanied
the
youth
out
of
the
cave
into
the
open
air
chapter
xlvi
the
cockpit
to
keep
holy
the
afternoon
of
the
sabbath
one
generally
goes
to
the
cockpit
in
the
philippines
just
as
to
the
in
spain
cockfighting
a
passion
introduced
into
the
country
and
exploited
for
a
century
past
is
one
of
the
vices
of
the
people
more
widely
spread
than
among
the
chinese
there
the
poor
man
goes
to
risk
all
that
he
has
desirous
of
getting
rich
without
work
there
the
rich
man
goes
to
amuse
himself
using
the
money
that
remains
to
him
from
his
feasts
and
his
masses
of
thanksgiving
the
fortune
that
he
gambles
is
his
own
the
cock
is
raised
with
much
more
care
perhaps
than
his
son
and
successor
in
the
cockpit
so
we
have
nothing
to
say
against
it
since
the
government
permits
it
and
even
in
a
way
recommends
it
by
providing
that
the
spectacle
may
take
place
only
in
the
on
in
order
that
all
may
see
it
and
be
encouraged
by
the
example
the
high
mass
until
nightfall
hours
let
us
proceed
thither
to
seek
out
some
of
our
acquaintances
the
cockpit
of
san
diego
does
not
differ
from
those
to
be
found
in
other
towns
except
in
some
details
it
consists
of
three
parts
the
first
of
which
the
entrance
is
a
large
rectangle
some
twenty
meters
long
by
fourteen
wide
on
one
side
is
the
gateway
generally
tended
by
an
old
woman
whose
business
it
is
to
collect
the
or
admission
fee
of
this
contribution
which
every
one
pays
the
government
receives
a
part
amounting
to
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pesos
a
year
it
is
said
that
with
this
money
with
which
vice
pays
its
license
magnificent
schoolhouses
are
erected
bridges
and
roads
are
constructed
prizes
for
encouraging
agriculture
and
commerce
are
distributed
blessed
be
the
vice
that
produces
such
good
results
in
this
first
enclosure
are
the
vendors
of
buyos
cigars
sweetmeats
and
foodstuffs
there
swarm
the
boys
in
company
with
their
fathers
or
uncles
who
carefully
initiate
them
into
the
secrets
of
life
this
enclosure
communicates
with
another
of
somewhat
larger
dimensions
a
kind
of
foyer
where
the
public
gathers
while
waiting
for
the
combats
there
are
the
greater
part
of
the
tied
with
cords
which
are
fastened
to
the
ground
by
means
of
a
piece
of
bone
or
hard
wood
there
are
assembled
the
gamblers
the
devotees
those
skilled
in
tying
on
the
gaffs
there
they
make
agreements
they
deliberate
they
beg
for
loans
they
curse
they
swear
they
laugh
boisterously
that
one
fondles
his
chicken
rubbing
his
hand
over
its
brilliant
plumage
this
one
examines
and
counts
the
scales
on
its
legs
they
recount
the
exploits
of
the
champions
there
you
will
see
many
with
mournful
faces
carrying
by
the
feet
corpses
picked
of
their
feathers
the
creature
that
was
the
favorite
for
months
petted
and
cared
for
day
and
night
on
which
were
founded
such
flattering
hopes
is
now
nothing
more
than
a
carcass
to
be
sold
for
a
peseta
or
to
be
stewed
with
ginger
and
eaten
that
very
night
transit
gloria
mundi
the
loser
returns
to
the
home
where
his
anxious
wife
and
ragged
children
await
him
without
his
money
or
his
chicken
of
all
that
golden
dream
of
all
those
vigils
during
months
from
the
dawn
of
day
to
the
setting
of
the
sun
of
all
those
fatigues
and
labors
there
results
only
a
peseta
the
ashes
left
from
so
much
smoke
in
this
foyer
even
the
least
intelligent
takes
part
in
the
discussion
while
the
man
of
most
hasty
judgment
conscientiously
investigates
the
matter
weighs
examines
extends
the
wings
feels
the
muscles
of
the
cocks
some
go
very
surrounded
and
followed
by
the
partisans
of
their
champions
others
who
are
dirty
and
bear
the
imprint
of
vice
on
their
squalid
features
anxiously
follow
the
movements
of
the
rich
to
note
the
bets
since
the
purse
may
become
empty
but
the
passion
never
satiated
no
countenance
here
but
is
animated
not
here
is
to
be
found
the
indolent
apathetic
silent
filipino
all
is
movement
passion
eagerness
it
may
be
one
would
say
that
they
have
that
thirst
which
is
quickened
by
the
water
of
the
swamp
from
this
place
one
passes
into
the
arena
which
is
known
as
the
the
wheel
the
ground
here
surrounded
by
is
usually
higher
than
that
in
the
two
other
divisions
in
the
back
part
reaching
almost
to
the
roof
are
tiers
of
seats
for
the
spectators
or
gamblers
since
these
are
the
same
during
the
fights
these
seats
are
filled
with
men
and
boys
who
shout
clamor
sweat
quarrel
and
blaspheme
fortunately
hardly
any
women
get
in
this
far
in
the
are
the
men
of
importance
the
rich
the
famous
bettors
the
contractor
the
referee
on
the
perfectly
leveled
ground
the
cocks
fight
and
from
there
destiny
apportions
to
the
families
smiles
or
tears
feast
or
famine
at
the
time
of
entering
we
see
the
gobernadorcillo
capitan
pablo
capitan
basilio
and
lucas
the
man
with
the
sear
on
his
face
who
felt
so
deeply
the
death
of
his
brother
capitan
basilio
approaches
one
of
the
townsmen
and
asks
do
you
know
which
cock
capitan
tiago
is
going
to
bring
i
do
know

morning

match

it
i
should
say
so
i
bet

house
and
my
camisa
on
it
at
that
moment
capitan
tiago
arrives
dressed
like
the
heavy
gamblers
in
a
camisa
of
canton
linen
woolen
pantaloons
and
a
wide
straw
hat
behind
him
come
two
servants
carrying
the
and
a
white
cock
of
enormous
size
sinang
tells
me
that
maria

improving
all

time

capitan
basilio

more
fever

weak

little
i

going
to
see
if

asks
capitan
basilio
looking
at
the
cock
and
taking
it
from
the
servant
that
depends
if

much
will

up
i
wo

for
less
than
two
have
you
seen
my
inquires
capitan
basilio
calling
to
a
man
who
is
carrying
a
small
capitan
tiago
examines
it
and
after
feeling
its
weight
and
studying
its
scales
returns
it
with
the
question
how
much
will
you
put
up
whatever
you
will
two
and
five
hundred
three
three
for
the
next
fight
after
this
the
chorus
of
curious
bystanders
and
the
gamblers
spread
the
news
that
two
celebrated
cocks
will
fight
each
of
which
has
a
history
and
a
reputation
all
wish
to
see
and
examine
the
two
celebrities
opinions
are
offered
prophecies
are
made
meanwhile
the
murmur
of
the
voices
grows
the
confusion
increases
the
is
broken
into
the
seats
are
filled
the
skilled
attendants
carry
the
two
cocks
into
the
arena
a
white
and
a
red
already
armed
but
with
the
gaffs
still
sheathed
cries
are
heard
on
the
white
on
the
white
while
some
other
voice
answers
on
the
red
the
odds
are
on
the
white
he
is
the
favorite
the
red
is
the
outsider
the
members
of
the
civil
guard
move
about
in
the
crowd
they
are
not
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
that
meritorious
corps
but
neither
are
they
in
civilian
costume
trousers
of
with
a
red
stripe
a
camisa
stained
blue
from
the
faded
blouse
and
a
make
up
their
costume
in
keeping
with
their
deportment
they
make
bets
and
keep
watch
they
raise
disturbances
and
talk
of
keeping
the
peace
while
the
spectators
are
yelling
waving
their
hands
flourishing
and
clinking
pieces
of
silver
while
they
search
in
their
pockets
for
the
last
coin
or
in
the
lack
of
such
try
to
pledge
their
word
promising
to
sell
the
carabao
or
the
next
crop
two
boys
brothers
apparently
follow
the
bettors
with
wistful
eyes
loiter
about
murmur
timid
words
to
which
no
one
listens
become
more
and
more
gloomy
and
gaze
at
one
another
and
dejectedly
lucas
watches
them
covertly
smiles
malignantly
jingles
his
silver
passes
close
to
them
and
gazing
into
the
cries
out
fifty
fifty
to
twenty
on
the
white
the
two
brothers
exchange
glances
i
told
you
muttered
the
elder
that
you
should
have
put
up
all
the
money
if
you
had
listened
to
me
we
should
now
have
something
to
bet
on
the
red
the
younger
timidly
approached
lucas
and
touched
him
on
the
arm
oh
it
you
exclaimed
the
latter
turning
around
with
feigned
surprise
does
your
brother
accept
my
proposition
or
do
you
want
to
bet
how
can
we
bet
when
we
lost
everything
then
you
accept
he
does
want
to
if
you
would
lend
us
something
now
that
you
say
you
know
us
lucas
scratched
his
head
pulled
at
his
camisa
and
replied
yes
i
know
you
you
are
tarsilo
and
bruno
both
young
and
strong
i
know
that
your
brave
father
died
as
a
result
of
the
hundred
lashes
a
day
those
soldiers
gave
him
i
know
that
you
do
think
of
revenging
him
do
meddle
in
our
affairs
broke
in
tarsilo
the
elder
that
might
lead
to
trouble
if
it
were
not
that
we
have
a
sister
we
should
have
been
hanged
long
ago
hanged
they
only
hang
a
coward
one
who
has
no
money
or
influence
and
at
all
events
the
mountains
are
near
a
hundred
to
twenty
on
the
white
cried
a
lend
us
four
pesos
three
two
begged
the
younger
we
soon
pay
them
back
double
the
fight
is
going
to
commence
lucas
again
scratched
his
head
tush
this
money
is
mine
don
crisostomo
has
given
it
to
me
for
those
who
are
willing
to
serve
him
but
i
see
that
you
not
like
your
father
he
was
really
brave
let
him
who
is
not
so
not
seek
amusement
so
saying
he
drew
away
from
them
a
little
let
take
him
up
what
the
difference
said
bruno
it
the
same
to
be
shot
as
to
be
hanged
we
poor
folks
are
good
for
nothing
else
you
right
but
think
of
our
sister
meanwhile
the
ring
has
been
cleared
and
the
combat
is
about
to
begin
the
voices
die
away
as
the
two
starters
with
the
expert
who
fastens
the
gaffs
are
left
alone
in
the
center
at
a
signal
from
the
referee
the
expert
unsheathes
the
gaffs
and
the
fine
blades
glitter
threateningly
sadly
and
silently
the
two
brothers
draw
nearer
to
the
ring
until
their
foreheads
are
pressed
against
the
railing
a
man
approaches
them
and
calls
into
their
ears
a
hundred
to
ten
on
the
white
tarsilo
stares
at
him
in
a
foolish
way
and
responds
to
bruno
nudge
with
a
grunt
the
starters
hold
the
cocks
with
skilful
delicacy
taking
care
not
to
wound
themselves
a
solemn
silence
reigns
the
spectators
seem
to
be
changed
into
hideous
wax
figures
they
present
one
cock
to
the
other
holding
his
head
down
so
that
the
other
may
peck
at
it
and
thus
irritate
him
then
the
other
is
given
a
like
opportunity
for
in
every
duel
there
must
be
fair
play
whether
it
is
a
question
of
parisian
cocks
or
filipino
cocks
afterwards
they
hold
them
up
in
sight
of
each
other
close
together
so
that
each
of
the
enraged
little
creatures
may
see
who
it
is
that
has
pulled
out
a
feather
and
with
whom
he
must
fight
their
bristle
up
as
they
gaze
at
each
other
fixedly
with
flashes
of
anger
darting
from
their
little
round
eyes
now
the
moment
has
come
the
attendants
place
them
on
the
ground
a
short
distance
apart
and
leave
them
a
clear
field
slowly
they
advance
their
footfalls
are
audible
on
the
hard
ground
no
one
in
the
crowd
speaks
no
one
breathes
raising
and
lowering
their
heads
as
if
to
gauge
one
another
with
a
look
the
two
cocks
utter
sounds
of
defiance
and
contempt
each
sees
the
bright
blade
throwing
out
its
cold
bluish
reflections
the
danger
animates
them
and
they
rush
directly
toward
each
other
but
a
pace
apart
they
check
themselves
with
fixed
gaze
and
bristling
plumage
at
that
moment
their
little
heads
are
filled
with
a
rush
of
blood
their
anger
flashes
forth
and
they
hurl
themselves
together
with
instinctive
valor
they
strike
beak
to
beak
breast
to
breast
gaff
to
gaff
wing
to
wing
but
the
blows
are
skilfully
parried
only
a
few
feathers
fall
again
they
size
each
other
up
suddenly
the
white
rises
on
his
wings
brandishing
the
deadly
knife
but
the
red
has
bent
his
legs
and
lowered
his
head
so
the
white
smites
only
the
empty
then
on
touching
the
ground
the
white
fearing
a
blow
from
behind
turns
quickly
to
face
his
adversary
the
red
attacks
him
furiously
but
he
defends
himself
calmly
not
undeservedly
is
he
the
favorite
of
the
spectators
all
of
whom
tremulously
and
anxiously
follow
the
fortunes
of
the
fight
only
here
and
there
an
involuntary
cry
being
heard
the
ground
becomes
strewn
with
red
and
white
feathers
dyed
in
blood
but
the
contest
is
not
for
the
first
blood
the
filipino
carrying
out
the
laws
dictated
by
his
government
wishes
it
to
be
to
the
death
or
until
one
or
the
other
turns
tail
and
runs
blood
covers
the
ground
the
blows
are
more
numerous
but
victory
still
hangs
in
the
balance
at
last
with
a
supreme
effort
the
white
throws
himself
forward
for
a
final
stroke
fastens
his
gaff
in
the
wing
of
the
red
and
catches
it
between
the
bones
but
the
white
himself
has
been
wounded
in
the
breast
and
both
are
weak
and
feeble
from
loss
of
blood
breathless
their
strength
spent
caught
one
against
the
other
they
remain
motionless
until
the
white
with
blood
pouring
from
his
beak
falls
kicking
his
the
red
remains
at
his
side
with
his
wing
caught
then
slowly
doubles
up
his
legs
and
gently
closes
his
eyes
then
the
referee
in
accordance
with
the
rule
prescribed
by
the
government
declares
the
red
the
winner
a
savage
yell
greets
the
decision
a
yell
that
is
heard
over
the
whole
town
even
and
prolonged
he
who
hears
this
from
afar
then
knows
that
the
winner
is
the
one
against
which
the
odds
were
placed
or
the
joy
would
not
be
so
lasting
the
same
happens
with
the
nations
when
a
small
one
gains
a
victory
over
a
large
one
it
is
sung
and
recounted
from
age
to
age
you
see
now
said
bruno
dejectedly
to
his
brother
if
you
had
listened
to
me
we
should
now
have
a
hundred
pesos
you
the
cause
of
our
being
penniless
tarsilo
did
not
answer
but
gazed
about
him
as
if
looking
for
some
one
there
he
is
talking
to
pedro
added
bruno
he
giving
him
money
lots
of
money
true
it
was
that
lucas
was
counting
silver
coins
into
the
hand
of
sisa
husband
the
two
then
exchanged
some
words
in
secret
and
separated
apparently
satisfied
pedro
must
have
agreed
that
what
it
is
to
be
decided
sighed
bruno
tarsilo
remained
gloomy
and
thoughtful
wiping
away
with
the
cuff
of
his
camisa
the
perspiration
that
ran
down
his
forehead
brother
said
bruno
i
going
to
accept
if
you
do
decide
the
continues
the
must
win
and
we
ought
not
to
lose
any
chance
i
want
to
bet
on
the
next
fight
what
the
difference
we
revenge
our
father
wait
said
tarsilo
as
he
gazed
at
him
fixedly
eye
to
eye
while
both
turned
pale
i
go
with
you
you
right
we
revenge
our
father
still
he
hesitated
and
again
wiped
away
the
perspiration
what
stopping
you
asked
bruno
impatiently
do
you
know
what
fight
comes
next
is
it
worth
while
if
you
think
that
way
no
have
you
heard
the
of
capitan
basilio
against
capitan
tiago
according
to
the
the
must
win
ah
the
i
bet
on
it
too
but
let
be
sure
first
bruno
made
a
sign
of
impatience
but
followed
his
brother
who
examined
the
cock
studied
it
meditated
and
reflected
asked
some
questions
the
poor
fellow
was
in
doubt
bruno
gazed
at
him
with
nervous
anger
but
do
you
see
that
wide
scale
he
has
by
the
side
of
his
spur
do
you
see
those
feet
what
more
do
you
want
look
at
those
legs
spread
out
his
wings
and
this
split
scale
above
this
wide
one
and
this
double
one
tarsilo
did
not
hear
him
but
went
on
examining
the
cock
the
clinking
of
gold
and
silver
came
to
his
ears
now
let
look
at
the
he
said
in
a
thick
voice
bruno
stamped
on
the
ground
and
gnashed
his
teeth
but
obeyed
they
approached
another
group
where
a
cock
was
being
prepared
for
the
ring
a
gaff
was
selected
red
silk
thread
for
tying
it
on
was
waxed
and
rubbed
thoroughly
tarsilo
took
in
the
creature
with
a
gloomily
impressive
gaze
as
if
he
were
not
looking
at
the
bird
so
much
as
at
something
in
the
future
he
rubbed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
and
said
to
his
brother
in
a
stifled
voice
are
you
ready
i
long
ago
without
looking
at
them
but
our
poor
sister
have
they
told
you
that
don
crisostomo
is
the
leader
you
see
him
walking
with
the
what
risk
do
we
run
and
if
we
get
killed
what
the
difference
our
father
was
flogged
to
death
you
right
the
brothers
now
sought
for
lucas
in
the
different
groups
as
soon
as
they
saw
him
tarsilo
stopped
no
let
get
out
of
here
going
to
ruin
ourselves
he
exclaimed
go
on
if
you
want
to
i
going
to
accept
bruno
unfortunately
a
man
approached
them
saying
are
you
betting
for
the
the
brothers
did
not
answer
i
give
odds
how
much
asked
bruno
the
man
began
to
count
out
his
pesos
bruno
watched
him
breathlessly
i
have
two
hundred
fifty
to
forty
no
said
bruno
resolutely
put
all
right
fifty
to
thirty
double
it
if
you
want
to
all
right
the
belongs
to
my
protector
and
i
just
won
a
hundred
to
sixty
taken
wait
till
i
get
the
money
but
i
hold
the
stakes
said
the
other
not
confiding
much
in
bruno
looks
it
all
the
same
to
me
answered
the
latter
trusting
to
his
fists
then
turning
to
his
brother
he
added
even
if
you
do
keep
out
i
going
in
tarsilo
reflected
he
loved
his
brother
and
liked
the
sport
and
unable
to
desert
him
he
murmured
let
it
go
they
made
their
way
to
lucas
who
on
seeing
them
approach
smiled
sir
called
tarsilo
what
up
how
much
will
you
give
us
asked
the
two
brothers
together
i
already
told
you
if
you
will
undertake
to
get
others
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
on
the
barracks
i
give
each
of
you
thirty
pesos
and
ten
pesos
for
each
companion

well
each
one

receive
a
hundred
pesos
and
you
double
that
amount
don
crisostomo
is
rich
accepted
exclaimed
bruno
let
have
the
money
i
knew
you
were
brave
as
your
father
was
come
so
that
those
fellows
who
killed
him
may
not
overhear
us
said
lucas
indicating
the
taking
them
into
a
corner
he
explained
to
them
while
he
was
counting
out
the
money
tomorrow
don
crisostomo
will
get
back
with
the
arms
day
after
tomorrow
about
eight
at
night
go
to
the
cemetery
and
i
let
you
know
the
final
arrangements
you
have
time
to
look
for
companions
after
they
had
left
him
the
two
brothers
seemed
to
have
changed
parts
tarsilo
was
calm
while
bruno
was
uneasy
chapter
xlvii
the
two
señoras
while
capitan
tiago
was
gambling
on
his
doña
victorina
was
taking
a
walk
through
the
town
for
the
purpose
of
observing
how
the
indolent
indians
kept
their
houses
and
fields
she
was
dressed
as
elegantly
as
possible
with
all
her
ribbons
and
flowers
over
her
silk
gown
in
order
to
impress
the
provincials
and
make
them
realize
what
a
distance
intervened
between
them
and
her
sacred
person
giving
her
arm
to
her
lame
husband
she
strutted
along
the
streets
amid
the
wonder
and
stupefaction
of
the
natives
her
cousin
linares
had
remained
in
the
house
what
ugly
shacks
these
indians
have
she
began
with
a
grimace
i
do
see
how
they
can
live
in
them
one
must
have
to
be
an
indian
and
how
rude
they
are
and
how
proud
they
do
take
off
their
hats
when
they
meet
us
hit
them
over
the
head
as
the
curates
and
the
officers
of
the
civil
guard
do
teach
them
politeness
and
if
they
hit
me
back
asked
de
espadaña
that
what
you
a
man
for
i
doña
victorina
was
falling
into
a
bad
humor
the
streets
were
unpaved
and
the
train
of
her
gown
was
covered
with
dust
besides
they
had
met
a
number
of
young
women
who
in
passing
them
had
dropped
their
eyes
and
had
not
admired
her
rich
costume
as
they
should
have
done
cochero
who
was
driving
sinang
and
her
cousin
in
an
elegant
carriage
had
the
impudence
to
yell
in
such
a
commanding
tone
that
she
had
to
jump
out
of
the
way
and
could
only
protest
look
at
that
brute
of
a
cochero
i
going
to
tell
his
master
to
train
his
servants
better
let
go
back
to
the
house
she
commanded
to
her
husband
who
fearing
a
storm
wheeled
on
his
crutch
in
obedience
to
her
mandate
they
met
and
exchanged
greetings
with
the
alferez
this
increased
doña
victorina
ill
humor
for
the
officer
not
only
did
not
proffer
any
compliment
on
her
costume
but
even
seemed
to
stare
at
it
in
a
mocking
way
you
ought
not
to
shake
hands
with
a
mere
alferez
she
said
to
her
husband
as
the
soldier
left
them
he
scarcely
touched
his
helmet
while
you
took
off
your
hat
you
do
know
how
to
maintain
your
rank
he
the
here
what
do
we
care
for
that
we
are
indians
perhaps
you
right
he
assented
not
caring
to
quarrel
they
passed
in
front
of
the
officer
dwelling
doña
consolacion
was
at
the
window
as
usual
dressed
in
flannel
and
smoking
her
cigar
as
the
house
was
low
the
two
señoras
measured
one
another
with
looks
doña
victorina
stared
while
the
muse
of
the
civil
guard
examined
her
from
head
to
foot
and
then
sticking
out
her
lower
lip
turned
her
head
away
and
spat
on
the
ground
this
used
up
the
last
of
doña
patience
leaving
her
husband
without
support
she
planted
herself
in
front
of
the
alfereza
trembling
with
anger
from
head
to
foot
and
unable
to
speak
doña
consolacion
slowly
turned
her
head
calmly
looked
her
over
again
and
once
more
spat
this
time
with
greater
disdain
what
the
matter
with
you
doña
she
asked
can
you
tell
me
señora
why
you
look
at
me
so
are
you
envious
doña
victorina
was
at
length
able
to
articulate
i
envious
of
you
i
of
you
drawled
the
muse
yes
i
envy
you
those
frizzes
come
woman
pleaded
the
doctor
any
let
me
teach
this
shameless
slattern
a
lesson
replied
his
wife
giving
him
such
a
shove
that
he
nearly
kissed
the
ground
then
she
again
turned
to
doña
consolacion
remember
who
you
dealing
with
she
exclaimed
do
think
that
i
a
provincial
or
a
soldier
in
my
house
in
manila
the
alfereces
do
eater
they
wait
at
the
door
oho
señora
alfereces
do
enter
but
cripples
do
like
that
one
ha
ha
ha
had
it
not
been
for
the
rouge
doña
victorian
would
have
been
seen
to
blush
she
tried
to
get
to
her
antagonist
but
the
sentinel
stopped
her
in
the
meantime
the
street
was
filling
up
with
a
curious
crowd
listen
i
lower
myself
talking
to
you
people
of
quality
do
you
want
to
wash
my
clothes
i
pay
you
well
do
you
think
that
i
know
that
you
were
a
doña
consolacion
straightened
up
furiously
the
remark
about
washing
hurt
her
do
you
think
that
we
do
know
who
you
are
and
what
class
of
people
you
belong
with
get
out
my
husband
has
already
told
me
señora
i
at
least
have
never
belonged
to
more
than
one
but
you
one
must
be
dying
of
hunger
to
take
the
leavings
the
mop
of
the
whole
world
this
shot
found
its
mark
with
doña
victorina
she
rolled
up
her
sleeves
clenched
her
fists
and
gritted
her
teeth
come
down
old
sow
she
cried
i
going
to
smash
that
dirty
mouth
of
yours
of
a
battalion
filthy
hag
the
muse
immediately
disappeared
from
the
window
and
was
soon
seen
running
down
the
stairs
flourishing
her
husband
whip
don
tiburcio
interposed
himself
supplicatingly
but
they
would
have
come
to
blows
had
not
the
alferez
arrived
on
the
scene
ladies
don
tiburcio
train
your
woman
better

her
some
decent
clothes
and
if
you
have
any
money
left

doña
victorina
here
i

mouth

cried
the
alferez
furiously
to
doña
victorina
be
thankful
that

kick
you
to
pieces
frizzes
ribbons
and

alferez
get
out
you
quack
you
do
wear
the
pants
the
women
brought
into
play
words
and
gestures
insults
and
abuse
dragging
out
all
the
evil
that
was
stored
in
the
recesses
of
their
minds
since
all
four
talked
at
once
and
said
so
many
things
that
might
hurt
the
prestige
of
certain
classes
by
the
truths
that
were
brought
to
light
we
forbear
from
recording
what
they
said
the
curious
spectators
while
they
may
not
have
understood
all
that
was
said
got
not
a
little
entertainment
out
of
the
scene
and
hoped
that
the
affair
would
come
to
blows
unfortunately
for
them
the
curate
came
along
and
restored
order
señores
señoras
what
a
shame

are

hypocrite
carlist
don
tiburcio

señora
hold
your
tongue
say
that
to
these
robbers
of
the
poor
little
by
little
the
lexicon
of
epithets
was
exhausted
the
review
of
shamelessness
of
the
two
couples
completed
and
with
threats
and
insults
they
gradually
drew
away
from
one
another
fray
salvi
moved
from
one
group
to
the
other
giving
animation
to
the
scene
would
that
our
friend
the
correspondent
had
been
present
this
very
day
we
go
to
manila
and
see
the
declared
the
raging
doña
victorina
to
her
husband

doña
victorina

fixedly
at
his
false
teeth
my
i
never
had
hold
of
a
but
she
did
not
let
him
finish
with
a
majestic
sweep
of
her
hand
she
snatched
out
his
false
teeth
and
trampled
them
in
the
street
thus
he
and
she
breathing
fire
they
reached
the
house
linares
was
talking
with
maria
clara
sinang
and
victoria
and
as
he
had
heard
nothing
of
the
quarrel
became
rather
uneasy
at
sight
of
his
cousins
maria
clara
lying
in
an
among
pillows
and
wraps
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
the
new
physiognomy
of
her
doctor
cousin
began
doña
victorina
you
must
challenge
the
alferez
right
away
or
why
asked
the
startled
linares

him
right
now
or

i
tell
everybody
here
who
you
are
but
doña
victorina
the
three
girls
exchanged
glances
you
see
the
alferez
has
insulted
us
and
said
that
you
are
what
you
are
his
old
hag
came
down
with
a
whip
and
he
this
thing
here
permitted
the
insult

man
exclaimed
sinang
they
had
a
fight
and
we
did
see
it

alferez

doctor

day

doña
victorina
doña
victorina
interrupted
the
now
pallid
linares

up
to
her
be
calm

then
he
added
in
a
whisper
do
be
imprudent
especially
just
now
at
that
moment
capitan
tiago
came
in
from
the
cockpit
sad
and
sighing
he
had
lost
his
but
doña
victorina
left
him
no
time
to
grieve
in
a
few
words
but
with
no
lack
of
strong
language
she
related
what
had
happened
trying
of
course
to
put
herself
in
the
best
light
possible
linares
is
going
to
challenge
him

her
merry

that

rose
and

with

at

capitan

dropped
his
eyes
while
the
señora
went

this
in
mind
never
marry
a
man
that
does
wear
trousers
you
expose
yourself
to
insults

from

the
girl
did
not
answer
her
but
turned
to
her
friends
and
said
help
me
to
my
room

walk
alone
by
their
aid
she
rose
and
with
her
waist
encircled
by
the
round

of

friends
resting
her
head
on
the
shoulder
of
the
beautiful

went
to
her
chamber
that
same
night
the
married
couple
gathered
their
effects
together
and
presented
capitan
tiago
with
a
bill
which
amounted
to
several
thousand
pesos
very
early
the
following
day
they
left
for

as

had
foretold
ibarra
arrived
on
the
following
day
his
first
visit
was
to
the
family
of
capitan
tiago
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
maria
clara
and
informing
her
that
his
grace
had
reconciled
him
with
religion
and
that
he
brought
to
the
curate
a
letter
of
recommendation
in
the
handwriting
of
the
archbishop
himself
aunt
isabel
was
not
a
little
rejoiced
at
this
for
she
liked
the
young
man
and
did
not
look
favorably
on
the
marriage
of
her
niece
with
linares
capitan
tiago
was
not
at
home
come
in
said
the
aunt
in
her
broken
spanish
maria
don
crisostomo
is
once
more
in
the
favor
of
god
the
archbishop
has
him
but
the
youth
was
unable
to
advance
the
smile
froze
on
his
lips
words
failed
him
standing
on
the
balcony
at
the
side
of
maria
clara
was
linares
arranging
bouquets
of
flowers
and
leaves
roses
and
sampaguitas
were
scattered
about
on
the
floor
reclining
in
a
big
chair
pale
with
a
sad
and
pensive
air
maria
clara
toyed
with
an
ivory
fan
which
was
not
whiter
than
her
shapely
fingers
at
the
appearance
of
ibarra
linares
turned
pale
and
maria
cheeks
flushed
crimson
she
tried
to
rise
but
strength
failed
her
so
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
let
the
fan
fall
an
embarrassed
silence
prevailed
for
a
few
moments
ibarra
was
then
able
to
move
forward
and
murmur
tremblingly
i
just
got
back
and
have
come
immediately
to
see
you
i
find
you
better
than
i
had
thought
i
should
the
girl
seemed
to
have
been
stricken
dumb
she
neither
said
anything
nor
raised
her
eyes
ibarra
looked
linares
over
from
head
to
foot
with
a
stare
which
the
bashful
youth
bore
haughtily
well
i
see
that
my
arrival
was
unexpected
said
ibarra
slowly
maria
pardon
me
that
i
did
have
myself
announced
at
some
other
time
i
be
able
to
make
explanations
to
you
about
my
conduct
we
still
see
one
another
surely
these
last
words
were
accompanied
by
a
look
at
linares
the
girl
raised
toward
him
her
lovely
eyes
full
of
purity
and
sadness
they
were
so
beseeching
and
eloquent
that
ibarra
stopped
in
confusion
may
i
come
tomorrow
you
know
that
for
my
part
you
are
always
welcome
she
answered
faintly
ibarra
withdrew
in
apparent
calm
but
with
a
tempest
in
his
head
and
ice
in
his
heart
what
he
had
just
seen
and
felt
was
incomprehensible
to
him
was
it
doubt
dislike
or
faithlessness
oh
only
a
woman
after
all
he
murmured
taking
no
note
of
where
he
was
going
he
reached
the
spot
where
the
schoolhouse
was
under
construction
the
work
was
well
advanced
ñor
juan
with
his
mile
and
coming
and
going
among
the
numerous
laborers
upon
catching
sight
of
ibarra
he
ran
to
meet
him
don
crisostomo
at
last
you
come
we
all
been
waiting
for
you
look
at
the
walls
they
already
more
than
a
meter
high
and
within
two
days
they
be
up
to
the
height
of
a
man
i
put
in
only
the
strongest
and
most
durable

sent
for
the
finest

and

for
the
finishings
do
you
want
to
look
at
the
foundations
the
workmen
saluted
ibarra
respectfully
while
ñor
juan
made
voluble
explanations
here
is
the
piping
that
i
have
taken
the
liberty
to
add
he
said
these
subterranean
conduits
lead
to
a
sort
of
cesspool
thirty
yards
away
it
will
help
fertilize
the
garden
there
was
nothing
of
that
in
the
plan
does
it
displease
you
quite
the
contrary
i
approve
what
you
done
and
congratulate
you
you
are
a
real
architect
from
whom
did
you
learn
the
business
from
myself
sir
replied
the
old
man
modestly
oh
before
i
forget
about
it
tell
those
who
may
have
scruples
if
perhaps
there
is
any
one
who
fears
to
speak
to
me
that
i
no
longer
excommunicated
the
archbishop
invited
me
to
dinner
sir
we
do
pay
any
attention
to
excommunications
all
of
us
are
excommunicated
padre
damaso
himself
is
and
yet
he
stays
fat
how
that
it
true
sir
for
a
year
ago
he
caned
the
coadjutor
who
is
just
as
much
a
sacred
person
as
he
is
who
pays
any
attention
to
excommunications
sir
among
the
laborers
ibarra
caught
sight
of
elias
who
as
he
saluted
him
along
with
the
others
gave
him
to
understand
by
a
look
that
he
had
something
to
say
to
him
ñor
juan
said
ibarra
will
you
bring
me
your
list
of
the
laborers
ñor
juan
disappeared
and
ibarra
approached
elias
who
was
by
himself
lifting
a
heavy
stone
into
a
cart
if
you
can
grant
me
a
few
hours
conversation
sir
walk
down
to
the
shore
of
the
lake
this
evening
and
get
into
my
banka
the
youth
nodded
and
elias
moved
away
ñor
juan
now
brought
the
list
but
ibarra
scanned
it
in
vain
the
name
of
elias
did
not
appear
on
it
chapter
xlix
the
voice
of
the
hunted
as
the
sun
was
sinking
below
the
horizon
ibarra
stepped
into
banka
at
the
shore
of
the
lake
the
youth
looked
out
of
humor
pardon
me
sir
said
elias
sadly
on
seeing
him
that
i
have
been
so
bold
as
to
make
this
appointment
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
freely
and
so
i
chose
this
means
for
here
we
wo
have
any
listeners
we
can
return
within
an
hour
you
wrong
friend
answered
ibarra
with
a
forced
smile
have
to
take
me
to
that
town
whose
belfry
we
see
from
here
a
mischance
forces
me
to
this
a
mischance
yes
on
my
way
here
i
met
the
alferez
and
he
forced
his
company
on
me
i
thought
of
you
and
remembered
that
he
knows
you
so
to
get
away
from
him
i
told
him
that
i
was
going
to
that
town
i
have
to
stay
there
all
day
since
he
will
look
for
me
tomorrow
afternoon
i
appreciate
your
thoughtfulness
but
you
might
simply
have
invited
him
to
accompany
you
answered
elias
naturally
what
about
you
he
would
have
recognized
me
since
the
only
time
he
ever
saw
me
he
was
in
a
position
to
take
careful
note
of
my
appearance
i
in
bad
luck
sighed
ibarra
thinking
of
maria
clara
what
did
you
have
to
tell
me
elias
looked
about
him
they
were
already
at
a
distance
from
the
shore
the
sun
had
set
and
as
in
these
latitudes
there
is
scarcely
any
twilight
the
shades
were
lengthening
bringing
into
view
the
bright
disk
of
the
full
moon
sir
replied
elias
gravely
i
am
the
bearer
of
the
wishes
of
many
unfortunates
unfortunates
what
do
you
mean
in
a
few
words
elias
recounted
his
conversation
with
the
leader
of
the
tulisanes
omitting
the
latter
doubts
and
threats
ibarra
listened
attentively
and
was
the
first
to
break
the
long
silence
that
reigned
after
he
had
finished
his
story
so
they
want
radical
reforms
in
the
armed
forces
in
the
priesthood
and
in
the
administration
of
justice
that
is
to
say
they
ask
for
paternal
treatment
from
the
government
reforms
in
what
sense
for
example
more
respect
for
a
man
dignity
more
security
for
the
individual
less
force
in
the
armed
forces
fewer
privileges
for
that
corps
which
so
easily
abuses
what
it
has
elias
answered
the
youth
i
do
know
who
you
are
but
i
suspect
that
you
are
not
a
man
of
the
people
you
think
and
act
so
differently
from
others
you
will
understand
me
if
i
tell
you
that
however
imperfect
the
condition
of
affairs
may
be
now
it
would
be
more
so
if
it
were
changed
i
might
be
able
to
get
the
friends
that
i
have
in
madrid
to
talk
paying
i
might
even
be
able
to
see
the
but
neither
would
the
former
accomplish
anything
nor
has
the
latter
sufficient
power
to
introduce
so
many
novelties
nor
would
i
ever
take
a
single
step
in
that
direction
for
the
reason
that
while
i
fully
understand
that
it
is
true
that
these
corporations
have
their
faults
they
are
necessary
at
this
time
they
are
what
is
known
as
a
necessary
evil
greatly
surprised
elias
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
do
you
then
also
believe
in
a
necessary
evil
sir
he
asked
in
a
voice
that
trembled
slightly
do
you
believe
that
in
order
to
do
good
it
is
necessary
to
do
evil
no
i
believe
in
it
as
in
a
violent
remedy
that
we
make
use
of
when
we
wish
to
cure
a
disease
now
then
the
country
is
an
organism
suffering
from
a
chronic
malady
and
in
order
to
cure
it
the
government
sees
the
necessity
of
employing
such
means
harsh
and
violent
if
you
wish
but
useful
and
necessary
he
is
a
bad
doctor
sir
who
seeks
only
to
destroy
or
stifle
the
symptoms
without
an
effort
to
examine
into
the
origin
of
the
malady
or
when
knowing
it
fears
to
attack
it
the
civil
guard
has
only
this
purpose
the
repression
of
crime
by
means
of
terror
and
force
a
purpose
that
it
does
not
fulfil
or
accomplishes
only
incidentally
you
must
take
into
account
the
truth
that
society
can
be
severe
with
individuals
only
when
it
has
provided
them
with
the
means
necessary
for
their
moral
perfection
in
our
country
where
there
is
no
society
since
there
is
no
unity
between
the
people
and
the
government
the
latter
should
be
indulgent
not
only
because
indulgence
is
necessary
but
also
because
the
individual
abandoned
and
uncared
for
by
it
has
less
responsibility
for
the
very
reason
that
he
has
received
less
guidance
besides
following
out
your
comparison
the
treatment
that
is
applied
to
the
ills
of
the
country
is
so
destructive
that
it
is
felt
only
in
the
sound
parts
of
the
organism
whose
vitality
is
thus
weakened
and
made
receptive
of
evil
would
it
not
be
more
rational
to
strengthen
the
diseased
parts
of
the
organism
and
lessen
the
violence
of
the
remedy
a
little
to
weaken
the
civil
guard
would
be
to
endanger
the
security
of
the
towns
the
security
of
the
towns
exclaimed
elias
bitterly
it
will
soon
be
fifteen
years
since
the
towns
have
had
their
civil
guard
and
look
still
we
have
tulisanes
still
we
hear
that
they
sack
towns
that
they
infest
the
highways
robberies
continue
and
the
perpetrators
are
not
hunted
down
crime
flourishes
and
the
real
criminal
goes
but
not
so
the
peaceful
inhabitant
of
the
town
ask
any
honorable
citizen
if
he
looks
upon
this
institution
as
a
benefit
a
protection
on
the
part
of
the
government
and
not
as
an
imposition
a
despotism
whose
outrageous
acts
do
more
damage
than
the
violent
deeds
of
criminals
these
latter
are
indeed
serious
but
they
are
rare
and
against
them
one
has
the
right
to
defend
himself
but
against
the
molestations
of
legal
force
he
is
not
even
allowed
a
protest
and
if
they
are
not
serious
they
are
nevertheless
continued
and
sanctioned
what
effect
does
this
institution
produce
among
our
people
it
paralyzes
communication
because
all
are
afraid
of
being
abused
on
trifling
pretexts
it
pays
more
attention
to
formalities
than
to
the
real
nature
of
things
which
is
the
first
symptom
of
incapacity
because
one
has
forgotten
his
cedula
he
must
be
manacled
and
knocked
about
regardless
of
the
fact
that
he
may
be
a
decent
and
respectable
citizen
the
superiors
hold
it
their
first
duty
to
make
people
salute
them
either
willingly
or
forcibly
even
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
their
inferiors
imitate
them
by
mistreating
and
robbing
the
country
folk
nor
are
pretexts
lacking
to
this
end
sanctity
of
the
home
does
not
exist
not
long
ago
in
kalamba
they
entered
by
forcing
their
way
through
the
windows
the
house
of
a
peaceful
inhabitant
to
whom
their
chief
owed
money
and
favors
there
is
no
personal
security
when
they
need
to
have
their
barracks
or
houses
cleaned
they
go
out
and
arrest
any
one
who
does
not
resist
them
in
order
to
make
him
work
the
whole
day
do
you
care
to
hear
more
during
these
holidays
gambling
which
is
prohibited
by
law
has
gone
on
while
they
forcibly
broke
up
the
celebrations
permitted
by
the
authorities
you
saw
what
the
people
thought
about
these
things
what
have
they
got
by
repressing
their
anger
and
hoping
for
human
justice
ah
sir
if
that
is
what
you
call
keeping
the
peace
i
agree
with
you
that
there
are
evils
replied
ibarra
but
let
us
bear
with
those
evils
on
account
of
the
benefits
that
accompany
them
this
institution
may
be
imperfect
but
believe
me
by
the
fear
that
it
inspires
it
keeps
the
number
of
criminals
from
increasing
say
rather
that
by
this
fear
the
number
is
increased
corrected
elias
before
the
creation
of
this
corps
almost
all
the
with
the
exception
of
a
very
few
were
criminals
from
hunger
they
plundered
and
robbed
in
order
to
live
but
when
their
time
of
want
was
passed
they
again
left
the
highways
clear
sufficient
to
put
them
to
flight
were
the
poor
but
brave
cuadrilleros
they
who
have
been
so
calumniated
by
the
writers
about
our
country
who
have
for
a
right
death
for
duty
fighting
and
for
reward
jests
now
there
are
tulisanes
who
are
such
for
life
a
single
fault
a
crime
inhumanly
punished
resistance
against
the
outrages
of
this
power
fear
of
atrocious
tortures
east
them
out
forever
from
society
and
condemn
them
to
slay
or
be
slain
the
terrorism
of
the
civil
guard
closes
against
them
the
doors
of
repentance
and
as
outlaws
they
fight
to
defend
themselves
in
the
mountains
better
than
the
soldiers
at
whom
they
laugh
the
result
is
that
we
are
unable
to
put
an
end
to
the
evil
that
we
have
created
remember
what
the
prudence
of
the
de
la
torre
accomplished
the
amnesty
granted
by
him
to
those
unhappy
people
has
proved
that
in
those
mountains
there
still
beat
the
hearts
of
men
and
that
they
only
wait
for
pardon
terrorism
is
useful
when
the
people
are
slaves
when
the
mountains
afford
no
when
power
places
a
sentinel
behind
every
tree
and
when
the
body
of
the
slave
contains
nothing
more
than
a
stomach
and
intestines
but
when
in
desperation
he
fights
for
his
life
feeling
his
arm
strong
his
heart
throb
his
whole
being
fill
with
hate
how
can
terrorism
hope
to
extinguish
the
flame
to
which
it
is
only
adding
fuel
i
am
perplexed
elias
to
hear
you
talk
thus
and
i
should
almost
believe
that
you
were
right
had
i
not
my
own
convictions
but
note
this
fact
and
do
be
offended
for
i
consider
you
an
exception
look
who
the
men
are
that
ask
for
these
reforms
nearly
all
criminals
or
on
the
way
to
be
such
criminals
now
or
future
criminals
but
why
are
they
such
because
their
peace
has
been
disturbed
their
happiness
destroyed
their
dearest
affections
wounded
and
when
they
have
asked
justice
for
protection
they
have
become
convinced
that
they
can
expect
it
only
from
themselves
but
you
are
mistaken
sir
if
you
think
that
only
the
criminals
ask
for
justice
go
from
town
to
town
from
house
to
house
listen
to
the
secret
sighings
in
the
bosoms
of
the
families
and
you
will
be
convinced
that
the
evils
which
the
civil
guard
corrects
are
the
same
as
if
not
less
than
those
it
causes
all
the
time
should
we
decide
from
this
that
all
the
people
are
criminals
if
so
then
why
defend
some
from
the
others
why
not
destroy
them
all
some
error
exists
here
which
i
do
not
see
just
now
some
fallacy
in
the
theory
to
invalidate
the
practise
for
in
spain
the
mother
country
this
corps
is
displaying
and
has
ever
displayed
great
usefulness
i
do
doubt
it
perhaps
there
it
is
better
organized
the
men
of
better
grade
perhaps
also
spain
needs
it
while
the
philippines
does
not
our
customs
our
mode
of
life
which
are
always
invoked
when
there
is
a
desire
to
deny
us
some
right
are
entirely
overlooked
when
the
desire
is
to
impose
something
upon
us
and
tell
me
sir
why
have
not
the
other
nations
which
from
their
nearness
to
spain
must
be
more
like
her
than
the
philippines
is
adopted
this
institution
is
it
because
of
this
that
they
still
have
fewer
robberies
on
their
railway
trains
fewer
riots
fewer
murders
and
fewer
assassinations
in
their
great
capitals
ibarra
bowed
his
head
in
deep
thought
raising
it
after
a
few
moments
to
reply
this
question
my
friend
calls
for
serious
study
if
my
inquiries
convince
me
that
these
complaints
are
well
founded
i
will
write
to
my
friends
in
madrid
since
we
have
no
representatives
meanwhile
believe
me
that
the
government
needs
a
corps
with
strength
enough
to
make
itself
respected
and
to
enforce
its
authority
yes
sir
when
the
government
is
at
war
with
the
country
but
for
the
welfare
of
the
government
itself
we
must
not
have
the
people
think
that
they
are
in
opposition
to
authority
rather
if
such
were
true
if
we
prefer
force
to
prestige
we
ought
to
take
care
to
whom
we
grant
this
unlimited
power
this
authority
so
much
power
in
the
hands
of
men
ignorant
men
filled
with
passions
without
moral
training
of
untried
principles
is
a
weapon
in
the
hands
of
a
madman
in
a
defenseless
multitude
i
concede
and
wish
to
believe
with
you
that
the
government
needs
this
weapon
but
then
let
it
choose
this
weapon
carefully
let
it
select
the
most
worthy
instruments
and
since
it
prefers
to
take
upon
itself
authority
rather
than
have
the
people
grant
it
at
least
let
it
be
seen
that
it
knows
how
to
exercise
it
elias
spoke
passionately
enthusiastically
in
vibrating
tones
his
eyes
flashed
a
solemn
pause
followed
the
banka
unimpelled
by
the
paddle
seemed
to
stand
still
on
the
water
the
moon
shone
majestically
in
a
sapphire
sky
and
a
few
lights
glimmered
on
the
distant
shore
what
more
do
they
ask
for
inquired
ibarra
reform
in
the
priesthood
answered
elias
in
a
sad
and
discouraged
tone
these
unfortunates
ask
for
more
protection
against
against
the
religious
orders
against
their
oppressors
sir
has
the
philippines
forgotten
what
she
owes
to
those
orders
has
she
forgotten
the
immense
debt
of
gratitude
that
is
due
from
her
to
those
who
snatched
her
from
error
to
give
her
the
true
faith
to
those
who
have
protected
her
against
the
tyrannical
acts
of
the
civil
power
this
is
the
evil
result
of
not
knowing
the
history
of
our
native
land
the
surprised
elias
could
hardly
credit
what
he
heard
sir
he
replied
in
a
grave
tone
you
accuse
these
people
of
ingratitude
let
me
one
of
the
people
who
suffer
defend
them
favors
rendered
in
order
to
have
any
claims
to
recognition
must
be
disinterested
let
us
pass
over
its
missionary
work
the
christian
charity
let
us
brush
history
aside
and
not
ask
what
spain
has
done
with
the
jewish
people
who
gave
all
europe
a
book
a
religion
and
a
god
what
she
has
done
with
the
arabic
people
who
gave
her
culture
who
were
tolerant
with
her
religious
beliefs
and
who
awoke
her
lethargic
national
spirit
so
nearly
destroyed
during
the
roman
and
gothic
dominations
you
say
that
she
snatched
us
from
error
and
gave
us
the
true
faith
do
you
call
faith
these
outward
forms
do
you
call
religion
this
traffic
in
girdles
and
scapularies
truth
these
miracles
and
wonderful
tales
that
we
hear
daily
is
this
the
law
of
jesus
christ
for
this
it
was
hardly
necessary
that
a
god
should
allow
himself
to
be
crucified
or
that
we
should
be
obliged
to
show
eternal
gratitude
superstition
existed
long
before
it
was
only
necessary
to
systematize
it
and
raise
the
price
of
its
merchandise
you
will
tell
me
that
however
imperfect
our
religion
may
be
at
present
it
is
preferable
to
what
we
had
before
i
believe
that
too
and
would
agree
with
you
in
saying
so
but
the
cost
is
too
great
since
for
it
we
have
given
up
our
nationality
our
independence
for
it
we
have
given
over
to
its
priests
our
best
towns
our
fields
and
still
give
up
our
savings
by
the
purchase
of
religious
objects
an
article
of
foreign
manufacture
has
been
introduced
among
us
we
have
paid
well
for
it
and
we
are
even
if
you
mean
the
protection
that
they
afforded
us
against
the
i
might
answer
that
through
them
we
fell
under
the
power
of
the
but
no
i
realize
that
a
true
faith
and
a
sincere
love
for
humanity
guided
the
first
missionaries
to
our
shores
i
realize
the
debt
of
gratitude
we
owe
to
those
noble
hearts
i
know
that
at
that
time
spain
abounded
in
heroes
of
all
kinds
in
religious
as
well
as
in
political
affairs
in
civil
and
in
military
life
but
because
the
forefathers
were
virtuous
should
we
consent
to
the
abuses
of
their
degenerate
descendants
because
they
have
rendered
us
great
service
should
we
be
to
blame
for
preventing
them
from
doing
us
wrong
the
country
does
not
ask
for
their
expulsion
but
only
for
reforms
required
by
the
changed
circumstances
and
new
needs
i
love
our
native
land
as
well
as
you
can
elias
i
understand
something
of
what
it
desires
and
i
have
listened
with
attention
to
all
you
have
said
but
after
all
my
friend
i
believe
that
we
are
looking
at
things
through
rather
impassioned
eyes
here
less
than
in
other
parts
do
i
see
the
necessity
for
reforms
is
it
possible
sir
asked
elias
extending
his
arms
in
a
gesture
of
despair
that
you
do
not
see
the
necessity
for
reforms
you
after
the
misfortunes
of
your
family
ah
i
forget
myself
and
my
own
troubles
in
the
presence
of
the
security
of
the
philippines
in
the
presence
of
the
interests
of
spain
interrupted
ibarra
warmly
to
preserve
the
philippines
it
is
meet
that
the
friars
continue
as
they
are
on
the
union
with
spain
depends
the
welfare
of
our
country
when
ibarra
had
ceased
elias
still
sat
in
an
attitude
of
attention
with
a
sad
countenance
and
eyes
that
had
lost
their
luster
the
missionaries
conquered
the
country
it
is
true
he
replied
but
do
you
believe
that
by
the
friars
the
philippines
will
be
preserved
yes
by
them
alone
such
is
the
belief
of
all
who
have
written
about
the
country
oh
exclaimed
elias
dejectedly
throwing
the
paddle
clown
in
the
banka
i
did
not
believe
that
you
would
have
so
poor
an
idea
of
the
government
and
of
the
country
why
do
you
condemn
both
what
would
you
say
of
the
members
of
a
family
that
dwells
in
peace
only
through
the
intervention
of
an
outsider
a
country
that
is
obedient
because
it
is
deceived
a
government
that
commands
be
cause
it
avails
itself
of
fraud
a
government
that
does
not
know
how
to
make
itself
loved
or
respected
for
its
own
sake
pardon
me
sir
but
i
believe
that
our
government
is
stupid
and
is
working
its
own
ruin
when
it
rejoices
that
such
is
the
belief
i
thank
you
for
your
kindness
where
do
you
wish
me
to
take
you
now
no
replied
ibarra
let
us
talk
it
is
necessary
to
see
who
is
right
on
such
an
important
subject
pardon
me
sir
replied
elias
shaking
his
head
but
i
have
the
eloquence
to
convince
you
even
though
i
have
had
some
education
i
am
still
an
indian
my
way
of
life
seems
to
you
a
precarious
one
and
my
words
will
always
seem
to
you
suspicious
those
who
have
given
voice
to
the
opposite
opinion
are
spaniards
and
as
such
even
though
they
may
speak
idly
and
foolishly
their
tones
their
titles
and
their
origin
make
their
words
sacred
and
give
them
such
authority
that
i
have
desisted
forever
from
arguing
against
them
moreover
when
i
see
that
you
who
love
your
country
you
whose
father
sleeps
beneath
these
quiet
waters
you
who
have
seen
yourself
attacked
insulted
and
persecuted
hold
such
opinions
in
spite
of
all
these
things
and
in
spite
of
your
knowledge
i
begin
to
doubt
my
own
convictions
and
to
admit
the
possibility
that
the
people
may
be
mistaken
i
have
to
tell
those
unfortunates
who
have
put
their
trust
in
men
that
they
must
place
it
in
god
and
their
own
strength
again
i
thank
you
tell
me
where
i
shall
take
you
elias
your
bitter
words
touch
my
heart
and
make
me
also
doubt
what
do
you
want
i
was
not
brought
up
among
the
people
so
i
am
perhaps
ignorant
of
their
needs
i
spent
my
childhood
in
the
jesuit
college
i
grew
up
in
europe
i
have
been
molded
by
books
learning
only
what
men
have
been
able
to
bring
to
light
what
remains
among
the
shadows
what
the
writers
do
not
tell
that
i
am
ignorant
of
yet
i
love
our
country
as
you
do
not
only
because
it
is
the
duty
of
every
man
to
love
the
country
to
which
he
owes
his
existence
and
to
which
he
will
no
doubt
owe
his
final
rest
not
only
because
my
father
so
taught
me
but
also
because
my
mother
was
an
indian
because
my
fondest
recollections
cluster
around
my
country
and
i
love
it
also
because
to
it
i
owe
and
shall
ever
owe
my
happiness
and
i
because
to
it
i
owe
my
misfortunes
muttered
elias
yes
my
friend
i
know
that
you
suffer
that
you
are
unfortunate
and
that
those
facts
make
you
look
into
the
future
darkly
and
influence
your
way
of
thinking
so
i
am
somewhat
forearmed
against
your
complaints
if
i
could
understand
your
motives
something
of
your
past
my
misfortunes
had
another
source
if
i
thought
that
the
story
of
them
would
be
of
any
use
i
would
relate
it
to
you
since
apart
from
the
fact
that
i
make
no
secret
of
it
it
is
quite
well
known
to
many
perhaps
on
hearing
it
i
might
correct
my
opinions
you
know
that
i
do
not
trust
much
to
theories
preferring
rather
to
be
guided
by
facts
elias
remained
thoughtful
for
a
few
moments
if
that
is
the
case
sir
i
will
tell
you
my
story
briefly
chapter
l
elias
story
some
sixty
years
ago
my
grandfather
dwelt
in
manila
being
employed
as
a
bookkeeper
in
a
spanish
commercial
house
he
was
then
very
young
was
married
and
had
a
son
one
night
from
some
unknown
cause
the
warehouse
burned
down
the
fire
was
communicated
to
the
dwelling
of
his
employer
and
from
there
to
many
other
buildings
the
losses
were
great
a
scapegoat
was
sought
and
the
merchant
accused
my
grandfather
in
vain
he
protested
his
innocence
but
he
was
poor
and
unable
to
pay
the
great
lawyers
so
he
was
condemned
to
be
flogged
publicly
and
paraded
through
the
streets
of
manila
not
so
very
long
since
they
still
used
the
infamous
method
of
punishment
which
the
people
call
the
y
and
which
is
a
thousand
times
more
dreadful
than
death
itself
abandoned
by
all
except
his
young
wife
my
grandfather
saw
himself
tied
to
a
horse
followed
by
an
unfeeling
crowd
and
whipped
on
every
in
the
sight
of
men
his
brothers
and
in
the
neighborhood
of
numerous
temples
of
a
god
of
peace
when
the
wretch
now
forever
disgraced
had
satisfied
the
vengeance
of
man
with
his
blood
his
tortures
and
his
cries
he
had
to
be
taken
off
the
horse
for
he
had
become
unconscious
would
to
god
that
he
had
died
but
by
one
of
those
refinements
of
cruelty
he
was
given
his
liberty
his
wife
pregnant
at
the
time
vainly
begged
from
door
to
door
for
work
or
alms
in
order
to
care
for
her
sick
husband
and
their
poor
son
but
who
would
trust
the
wife
of
an
incendiary
and
a
disgraced
man
the
wife
then
had
to
become
a
prostitute
ibarra
rose
in
his
seat
oh
do
get
excited
prostitution
was
not
now
a
dishonor
for
her
or
a
disgrace
to
her
husband
for
them
honor
and
shame
no
longer
existed
the
husband
recovered
from
his
wounds
and
came
with
his
wife
and
child
to
hide
himself
in
the
mountains
of
this
province
here
they
lived
several
months
miserable
alone
hated
and
shunned
by
all
the
wife
gave
birth
to
a
sickly
child
which
fortunately
died
unable
to
endure
such
misery
and
being
less
courageous
than
his
wife
my
grandfather
in
despair
at
seeing
his
sick
wife
deprived
of
all
care
and
assistance
hanged
himself
his
corpse
rotted
in
sight
of
the
son
who
was
scarcely
able
to
care
for
his
sick
mother
and
the
stench
from
it
led
to
their
discovery
her
husband
death
was
attributed
to
her
for
of
what
is
the
wife
of
a
wretch
a
woman
who
has
been
a
prostitute
besides
not
believed
to
be
capable
if
she
swears
they
call
her
a
perjurer
if
she
weeps
they
say
that
she
is
acting
and
that
she
blasphemes
when
she
calls
on
god
nevertheless
they
had
pity
on
her
condition
and
waited
for
the
birth
of
another
child
before
they
flogged
her
you
know
how
the
friars
spread
the
belief
that
the
indians
can
only
be
managed
by
blows
read
what
padre
gaspar
de
san
agustin
says
a
woman
thus
condemned
will
curse
the
day
on
which
her
child
is
born
and
this
besides
prolonging
her
torture
violates
every
maternal
sentiment
unfortunately
she
brought
forth
a
healthy
child
two
months
afterwards
the
sentence
was
executed
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
men
who
thought
that
thus
they
were
performing
their
duty
not
being
at
peace
in
these
mountains
she
then
fled
with
her
two
sons
to
a
neighboring
province
where
they
lived
like
wild
beasts
hating
and
hated
the
elder
of
the
two
boys
still
remembered
even
amid
so
much
misery
the
happiness
of
his
infancy
so
he
became
a
tulisan
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
strong
enough
before
long
the
bloody
name
of
balat
spread
from
province
to
province
a
terror
to
the
people
because
in
his
revenge
he
did
everything
with
blood
and
fire
the
younger
who
was
by
nature
resigned
himself
to
his
shameful
fate
along
with
his
mother
and
they
lived
on
what
the
woods
afforded
clothing
themselves
in
the
rags
of
travelers
she
had
lost
her
name
being
known
only
as
convict
the
prostitute
the
he
was
known
as
the
son
of
his
mother
only
because
the
gentleness
of
his
disposition
led
every
one
to
believe
that
he
was
not
the
son
of
the
incendiary
and
because
any
doubt
as
to
the
morality
of
the
indians
can
be
held
reasonable
at
last
one
day
the
notorious
balat
fell
into
the
clutches
of
the
authorities
who
exacted
of
him
a
strict
accounting
for
his
crimes
and
of
his
mother
for
having
done
nothing
to
rear
him
properly
one
morning
the
younger
brother
went
to
look
for
his
mother
who
had
gone
into
the
woods
to
gather
mushrooms
and
had
not
returned
he
found
her
stretched
out
on
the
ground
under
a
beside
the
highway
her
face
turned
toward
the
sky
her
eyes
fixed
and
staring
her
clenched
hands
buried
in
the
earth
some
impulse
moved
him
to
look
up
in
the
direction
toward
which
the
eyes
of
the
dead
woman
were
staring
and
he
saw
hanging
from
a
branch
a
basket
and
in
the
basket
the
gory
head
of
his
brother
my
god
ejaculated
ibarra
that
might
have
been
the
exclamation
of
my
father
continued
elias
coldly
the
body
of
the
brigand
had
been
cut
up
and
the
trunk
buried
but
his
limbs
were
distributed
and
hung
up
in
different
towns
if
ever
you
go
from
kalamba
to
santo
tomas
you
will
still
see
a
withered
where
one
of
my
uncle
legs
hung
rotting
nature
has
blasted
the
tree
so
that
it
no
longer
grows
or
bears
fruit
the
same
was
done
with
the
other
limbs
but
the
head
as
the
best
part
of
the
person
and
the
portion
most
easily
recognizable
was
hung
up
in
front
of
his
mother
hut
ibarra
bowed
his
head
the
boy
fled
like
one
accursed
elias
went
on
he
fled
from
town
to
town
by
mountain
and
valley
when
he
thought
that
he
had
reached
a
place
where
he
was
not
known
he
hired
himself
out
as
a
laborer
in
the
house
of
a
rich
man
in
the
province
of
tayabas
his
activity
and
the
gentleness
of
his
character
gained
him
the
of
all
who
did
not
know
his
past
and
by
his
thrift
and
economy
he
succeeded
in
accumulating
a
little
capital
he
was
still
young
he
thought
his
sorrows
buried
in
the
past
and
he
dreamed
of
a
happy
future
his
pleasant
appearance
his
youth
and
his
somewhat
unfortunate
condition
won
him
the
love
of
a
young
woman
of
the
town
but
he
dared
not
ask
for
her
hand
from
fear
that
his
past
might
become
known
but
love
is
stronger
than
anything
else
and
they
wandered
from
the
straight
path
so
to
save
the
woman
honor
he
risked
everything
by
asking
for
her
in
marriage
the
records
were
sought
and
his
whole
past
became
known
the
girl
father
was
rich
and
succeeded
in
having
him
prosecuted
he
did
not
try
to
defend
himself
but
admitted
everything
and
so
was
sent
to
prison
the
woman
gave
birth
to
twins
a
boy
and
a
girl
who
were
nurtured
in
secret
and
made
to
believe
that
their
father
was
dead
no
difficult
matter
since
at
a
tender
age
they
saw
their
mother
die
and
they
gave
little
thought
to
tracing
genealogies
as
our
maternal
grandfather
was
rich
our
childhood
passed
happily
my
sister
and
i
were
brought
up
together
loving
one
another
as
only
twins
can
love
when
they
have
no
other
affections
when
quite
young
i
was
sent
to
study
in
the
jesuit
college
and
my
sister
in
order
that
we
might
not
be
completely
separated
entered
the
concordia
college
after
our
brief
education
was
finished
since
we
desired
only
to
be
farmers
we
returned
to
the
town
to
take
possession
of
the
inheritance
left
us
by
our
grandfather
we
lived
happily
for
a
time
the
future
smiled
on
us
we
had
many
servants
our
fields
produced
abundant
harvests
and
my
sister
was
about
to
be
married
to
a
young
man
whom
she
adored
and
who
responded
equally
to
her
affection
but
in
a
dispute
over
money
and
by
reason
of
my
haughty
disposition
at
that
time
i
alienated
the
good
will
of
a
distant
relative
and
one
day
he
east
in
my
face
my
doubtful
birth
and
shameful
descent
i
thought
it
all
a
slander
and
demanded
satisfaction
the
tomb
which
covered
so
much
rottenness
was
again
opened
and
to
my
consternation
the
whole
truth
came
out
to
overwhelm
me
to
add
to
our
sorrow
we
had
had
for
many
years
an
old
servant
who
had
endured
all
my
whims
without
ever
leaving
us
contenting
himself
merely
with
weeping
and
groaning
at
the
rough
jests
of
the
other
servants
i
do
know
how
my
relative
had
found
it
out
but
the
fact
is
that
he
had
this
old
man
summoned
into
court
and
made
him
tell
the
truth
that
old
servant
who
had
clung
to
his
beloved
children
and
whom
i
had
abused
many
times
was
my
father
our
happiness
faded
away
i
gave
up
our
fortune
my
sister
lost
her
betrothed
and
with
our
father
we
left
the
town
to
seek
refuge
elsewhere
the
thought
that
he
had
contributed
to
our
misfortunes
shortened
the
old
man
days
but
before
he
died
i
learned
from
his
lips
the
whole
story
of
the
sorrowful
past
my
sister
and
i
were
left
alone
she
wept
a
great
deal
but
even
in
the
midst
of
such
great
sorrows
as
heaped
themselves
upon
us
she
could
not
forget
her
love
without
complaining
without
uttering
a
word
she
saw
her
former
sweetheart
married
to
another
girl
but
i
watched
her
gradually
sicken
without
being
able
to
console
her
one
day
she
disappeared
and
it
was
in
vain
that
i
sought
everywhere
in
vain
i
made
inquiries
about
her
about
six
months
afterwards
i
learned
that
about
that
time
after
a
flood
on
the
lake
there
had
been
found
in
some
rice
fields
bordering
on
the
beach
at
kalamba
the
corpse
of
a
young
woman
who
had
been
either
drowned
or
murdered
for
she
had
had
so
they
said
a
knife
sticking
in
her
breast
the
officials
of
that
town
published
the
fact
in
the
country
round
about
but
no
one
came
to
claim
the
body
no
young
woman
apparently
had
disappeared
from
the
description
they
gave
me
afterward
of
her
dress
her
ornaments
the
beauty
of
her
countenance
and
her
abundant
hair
i
recognized
in
her
my
poor
sister
since
then
i
have
wandered
from
province
to
province
my
reputation
and
my
history
are
in
the
mouths
of
many
they
attribute
great
deeds
to
me
sometimes
calumniating
me
but
i
pay
little
attention
to
men
keeping
ever
on
my
way
such
in
brief
is
my
story
a
story
of
one
of
the
judgments
of
men
elias
fell
silent
as
he
rowed
along
i
still
believe
that
you
are
not
wrong
murmured
crisostomo
in
a
low
voice
when
you
say
that
justice
should
seek
to
do
good
by
rewarding
virtue
and
educating
the
criminals
only
it
impossible
utopian
and
where
could
be
secured
so
much
money
so
many
new
employees
for
what
then
are
the
priests
who
proclaim
their
mission
of
peace
and
charity
is
it
more
meritorious
to
moisten
the
head
of
a
child
with
water
to
give
it
salt
to
eat
than
to
awake
in
the
benighted
conscience
of
a
criminal
that
spark
which
god
has
granted
to
every
man
to
light
him
to
his
welfare
is
it
more
humane
to
accompany
a
criminal
to
the
scaffold
than
to
lead
him
along
the
difficult
path
from
vice
to
virtue
do
they
also
pay
spies
executioners
these
things
besides
being
dirty
also
cost
money
my
friend
neither
you
nor
i
although
we
may
wish
it
can
accomplish
this
alone
it
is
true
we
are
nothing
but
take
up
the
cause
of
the
people
unite
yourself
with
the
people
be
not
heedless
of
their
cries
set
an
example
to
the
rest
spread
the
idea
of
what
is
called
a
fatherland
what
the
people
ask
for
is
impossible
we
must
wait
wait
to
wait
means
to
suffer
if
i
should
ask
for
it
the
powers
that
be
would
laugh
at
me
but
if
the
people
supported
you
never
i
will
never
be
the
one
to
lead
the
multitude
to
get
by
force
what
the
government
does
not
think
proper
to
grant
no
if
i
should
ever
see
that
multitude
armed
i
would
place
myself
on
the
side
of
the
government
for
in
such
a
mob
i
should
not
see
my
countrymen
i
desire
the
country
welfare
therefore
i
would
build
a
schoolhouse
i
seek
it
by
means
of
instruction
by
progressive
advancement
without
light
there
is
no
road
neither
is
there
liberty
without
strife
answered
elias
the
fact
is
that
i
do
want
that
liberty
the
fact
is
that
without
liberty
there
is
no
light
replied
the
pilot
with
warmth
you
say
that
you
are
only
slightly
acquainted
with
your
country
and
i
believe
you
you
do
see
the
struggle
that
is
preparing
you
do
see
the
cloud
on
the
horizon
the
fight
is
beginning
in
the
sphere
of
ideas
to
descend
later
into
the
arena
which
will
be
dyed
with
blood
i
hear
the
voice
of
god
woe
unto
them
who
would
oppose
it
for
them
history
has
not
been
written
elias
was
transfigured
standing
uncovered
with
his
manly
face
illuminated
by
the
moon
there
was
something
extraordinary
about
him
he
shook
his
long
hair
and
went
on
do
you
see
how
everything
is
awakening
the
sleep
has
lasted
for
centuries
but
one
day
the
thunderbolt
struck
and
in
striking
infused
life
since
then
new
tendencies
are
stirring
our
spirits
and
these
tendencies
today
scattered
will
some
day
be
united
guided
by
the
god
who
has
not
failed
other
peoples
and
who
will
not
fail
us
for
his
cause
is
the
cause
of
liberty
a
solemn
silence
followed
these
words
while
the
banka
carried
along
insensibly
by
the
waves
neared
the
shore
elias
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
what
shall
i
tell
those
who
sent
me
he
asked
with
a
change
from
his
former
tone
i
already
told
you
i
greatly
deplore
their
condition
but
they
should
wait
evils
are
not
remedied
by
other
evils
and
in
our
misfortunes
each
of
us
has
his
share
of
blame
elias
did
not
again
reply
but
dropped
his
head
and
rowed
along
until
they
reached
the
shore
where
he
took
leave
of
ibarra
i
thank
you
sir
for
the
condescension
you
have
shown
me
now
for
your
own
good
i
beg
of
you
that
in
the
future
you
forget
me
and
that
you
do
not
recognize
me
again
no
matter
in
what
situation
you
may
find
me
so
saying
he
drew
away
in
the
banka
rowing
toward
a
thicket
on
the
shore
as
he
covered
the
long
distance
he
remained
silent
apparently
intent
upon
nothing
but
the
thousands
of
phosphorescent
diamonds
that
the
oar
caught
up
and
dropped
back
into
the
lake
where
they
disappeared
mysteriously
into
the
blue
waves
when
he
had
reached
the
shadow
of
the
thicket
a
man
came
out
of
it
and
approached
the
banka
what
shall
i
tell
the
capitan
he
asked
tell
him
that
elias
if
he
lives
will
keep
his
word
was
the
sad
answer
when
will
you
join
us
then
when
your
capitan
thinks
that
the
hour
of
danger
has
come
very
well
if
i

in

the
affair
was
serious
he
was
well
enough
acquainted
with
the
character
of
doña
victorina
to
know
what
she
was
capable
of
to
talk
to
her
of
reason
was
to
talk
of
honesty
and
courtesy
to
a
revenue
carbineer
when
he
proposes
to
find
contraband
where
there
is
none
to

there

no

the
difficulty

challenge
but
how
suppose

he
soliloquized

the
hour

listened

the
old

to
oblige

to
get
myself
tangled
up
to
tell

to
make
a
blustering

what

now
i
sorry
that
i
been
secretary
to
all
the

while
the
good

was
in
the
midst
of
his
soliloquy
padre
salvi
came
in
the
franciscan
was
even
thinner
and
paler
than
usual
but
his
eyes
gleamed
with
a
strange
light
and
his
lips
wore
a
peculiar
smile
señor
linares
all
alone
was
his
greeting
as
he
made
his
way
to
the
sala
through
the
door
of
which
floated
the
notes
from
a
piano
linares
tried
to
smile
where
is
don
santiago
continued
the
curate
capitan
tiago
at
that
moment
appeared
kissed
the
curate
hand
and
relieved
him
of
his
hat
and
cane
smiling
all
the
while
like
one
of
the
blessed
come
come
exclaimed
the
curate
entering
the
sala
followed
by
linares
and
capitan
tiago
i
have
good
news
for
you
all
i
just
received
letters
from
manila
which
confirm
the
one
señor
ibarra
brought
me
yesterday
so
don
santiago
the
objection
is
removed
maria
clara
who
was
seated
at
the
piano
between
her
two
friends
partly
rose
but
her
strength
failed
her
and
she
fell
back
again
linares
turned
pale
and
looked
at
capitan
tiago
who
dropped
his
eyes
that
young
man
seems
to
me
to
be
very
agreeable
continued
the
curate
at
first
i
misjudged
him
he
a
little
but
he
knows
so
well
how
to
atone
for
his
faults
afterwards
that
one
ca
hold
anything
against
him
if
it
were
not
for
padre
damaso
here
the
curate
shot
a
quick
glance
at
maria
clara
who
was
listening
without
taking
her
eyes
off
the
sheet
of
music
in
spite
of
the
sly
pinches
of
sinang
who
was
thus
expressing
her
joy
had
she
been
alone
she
would
have
danced
padre
damaso
queried
linares
yes
padre
damaso
has
said
the
curate
went
on
without
taking
his
gaze
from
maria
clara
that
as
being
her
sponsor
in
baptism
he
ca
permit
but
after
all
i
believe
that
if
señor
ibarra
begs
his
pardon
which
i
do
doubt
he
do
everything
will
be
settled
maria
clara
rose
made
some
excuse
and
retired
to
her
chamber
accompanied
by
victoria
but
if
padre
damaso
does
pardon
him
asked
capitan
tiago
in
a
low
voice
then
maria
clara
will
decide
padre
damaso
is
her
father
spiritually
but
i
think
they
reach
an
understanding
at
that
moment
footsteps
were
heard
and
ibarra
appeared
followed
by
aunt
isabel
his
appearance
produced
varied
impressions
to
his
affable
greeting
capitan
tiago
did
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
to
cry
he
acknowledged
the
presence
of
linares
with
a
profound
bow
fray
salvi
arose
and
extended
his
hand
so
cordially
that
the
youth
could
not
restrain
a
look
of
astonishment
do
be
surprised
said
fray
salvi
for
i
was
just
now
praising
you
ibarra
thanked
him
and
went
up
to
sinang
who
began
with
her
childish
garrulity
where
have
you
been
all
day
we
were
all
asking
where
can
that
soul
redeemed
from
purgatory
have
gone
and
we
all
said
the
same
thing
may
i
know
what
you
said
no
that
a
secret
but
i
tell
you
soon
alone
now
tell
me
where
you
been
so
we
can
see
who
guessed
right
no
that
also
a
secret
but
i
tell
you
alone
if
these
gentlemen
will
excuse
us
certainly
certainly
by
all
means
exclaimed
padre
salvi
rejoicing
over
the
prospect
of
learning
a
secret

one
end
of
the
sala

she
begins
to
cry
capitan
tiago

padre

about

i
said

to
cry

grave

sinang

in
the
town
of
los
baños

going
to

and
i
thinking
of

your
father

partner

more
than

secret

sinang
aloud
in
the
tone
of
a
cheated
usurer
i
thought

careful

do
want
you
to
make
it
known
nor
do
i
want

replied
sinang
turning
up
her
nose
if
it
were
something
more
important
i
would
tell
my
friends
but
to
buy
coconuts
coconuts
who
interested
in
coconuts
and
with
extraordinary
haste
she
ran
to
join
her
friends
a
few
minutes
later
ibarra
seeing
that
the
interest
of
the
party
could
only
languish
took
his
leave
capitan
tiago
wore
a
look
linares
was
silent
and
watchful
while
the
curate
with
assumed
cheerfulness
talked
of
indifferent
matters
none
of
the
girls
had
reappeared
chapter
lii
the
cards
of
the
dead
and
the
shadows
the
moon
was
hidden
in
a
cloudy
sky
while
a
cold
wind
precursor
of
the
approaching
december
swept
the
dry
leaves
and
dust
about
in
the
narrow
pathway
leading
to
the
cemetery
three
shadowy
forms
were
conversing
in
low
tones
under
the
arch
of
the
gateway
have
you
spoken
to
elias
asked
a
voice
no
you
know
how
reserved
and
circumspect
he
is
but
he
ought
to
be
one
of
us
don
crisostomo
saved
his
life
that
why
i
joined
said
the
first
voice
don
crisostomo
had
my
wife
cured
in
the
house
of
a
doctor
in
manila
i
look
after
the
convento
to
settle
some
old
scores
with
the
curate
and
we
take
care
of
the
barracks
to
show
the
that
our
father
had
sons
how
many
of
us
will
there
be
five
and
five
will
be
enough
don
crisostomo
servant
though
says
there
be
twenty
of
us
what
if
you
do
succeed
hist
exclaimed
one
of
the
shadows
and
all
fell
silent
in
the
a
shadowy
figure
was
seen
to
approach
sneaking
along
by
the
fence
from
time
to
time
it
stopped
as
if
to
look
back
nor
was
reason
for
this
movement
lacking
since
some
twenty
paces
behind
it
came
another
figure
larger
and
apparently
darker
than
the
first
but
so
lightly
did
it
touch
the
ground
that
it
vanished
as
rapidly
as
though
the
earth
had
swallowed
it
every
time
the
first
shadow
paused
and
turned
they
following
me
muttered
the
first
figure
can
it
be
the
did
the
senior
sacristan
lie
they
said
that
they
would
meet
here
thought
the
second
shadow
some
mischief
must
be
on
foot
when
the
two
brothers
conceal
it
from
me
at
length
the
first
shadow
reached
the
gateway
of
the
cemetery
the
three
who
were
already
there
stepped
forward
is
that
you
is
that
you
we
must
scatter
for
they
followed
me
tomorrow
you
get
the
arms
and
tomorrow
night
is
the
time
the
cry
is
don
crisostomo
go
the
three
shadows
disappeared
behind
the
stone
walls
the
later
arrival
hid
in
the
hollow
of
the
gateway
and
waited
silently
see
who
following
me
he
thought
the
second
shadow
came
up
very
cautiously
and
paused
as
if
to
look
about
him
i
late
he
muttered
but
perhaps
they
will
return
a
thin
fine
rain
which
threatened
to
last
began
to
fall
so
it
occurred
to
him
to
take
refuge
under
the
gateway
naturally
he
ran
against
the
other
ah
who
are
you
asked
the
latest
arrival
in
a
rough
tone
who
are
you
returned
the
other
calmly
after
which
there
followed
a
moment
pause
as
each
tried
to
recognize
the
other
voice
and
to
make
out
his
features
what
are
you
waiting
here
for
asked
he
of
the
rough
voice
for
the
clock
to
strike
eight
so
that
i
can
play
cards
with
the
dead
i
want
to
win
something
tonight
answered
the
other
in
a
natural
tone
and
you
what
have
you
come
for
for
for
the
same
purpose
i
glad
of
that
i
not
be
alone
i
brought
cards
at
the
first
stroke
of
the
bell
i
make
the
lay
at
the
second
deal
the
cards
that
move
are
the
cards
of
the
dead
and
we
have
to
cut
for
them
have
you
brought
cards
no
then
how
it
simple
enough
just
as
you
going
to
deal
for
them
so
i
expect
them
to
play
for
me
but
what
if
the
dead
do
play
what
can
we
do
gambling
has
yet
been
made
compulsory
among
the
dead
a
short
silence
ensued
are
you
armed
how
are
you
going
to
fight
with
the
dead
with
my
fists
answered
the
larger
of
the
two
oh
the
devil
now
i
remember
the
dead
wo
bet
when
there
more
than
one
living
person
and
there
are
two
of
us
is
that
right
well
i
do
want
to
leave
nor
i
short
of
money
answered
the
smaller
but
let
do
this
let
play
for
it
the
one
who
loses
to
leave
all
right
agreed
the
other
rather
ungraciously
then
get
inside
have
you
any
matches
they
went
in
to
seek
in
the
for
a
suitable
place
and
soon
found
a
niche
in
which
they
could
sit
the
shorter
took
some
cards
from
his
salakot
while
the
other
struck
a
match
in
the
light
from
which
they
stared
at
each
other
but
from
the
expressions
on
their
faces
apparently
without
recognition
nevertheless
we
can
recognize
in
the
taller
and
one
elias
and
in
the
shorter
one
from
the
scar
on
his
cheek
lucas
cut
called
lucas
still
staring
at
the
other
he
pushed
aside
some
bones
that
were
in
the
niche
and
dealt
an
ace
and
a
jack
elias
lighted
match
after
match
on
the
jack
he
said
and
to
indicate
the
card
placed
a
vertebra
on
top
of
it
play
called
lucas
as
he
dealt
an
ace
with
the
fourth
or
fifth
card
you
lost
he
added
now
leave
me
alone
so
that
i
can
try
to
make
a
raise
elias
moved
away
without
a
word
and
was
soon
swallowed
up
in
the
darkness
several
minutes
later
the
struck
eight
and
the
bell
announced
the
hour
of
the
souls
but
lucas
invited
no
one
to
play
nor
did
he
call
on
the
dead
as
the
superstition
directs
instead
he
took
off
his
hat
and
muttered
a
few
prayers
crossing
and
recrossing
himself
with
the
same
fervor
with
which
at
that
same
moment
the
leader
of
the
brotherhood
of
the
holy
rosary
was
going
through
a
similar
performance
throughout
the
night
a
drizzling
rain
continued
to
fall
by
nine
the
streets
were
dark
and
solitary
the
lanterns
which
the
inhabitants
were
required
to
hang
out
scarcely
illuminated
a
small
circle
around
each
seeming
to
be
lighted
only
to
render
the
darkness
more
apparent
two
paced
back
and
forth
in
the
street
near
the
church
it
cold
said
one
in
tagalog
with
a
visayan
accent
we
caught
any
sacristan
so
there
is
no
one
to
repair
the
they
all
scared
out
by
the
death
of
that
other
one
this
makes
me
tired
me
too
answered
the
other
no
one
commits
robbery
no
one
raises
a
disturbance
but
thank
god
they
say
that
elias
is
in
town
the
alferez
says
that
whoever
catches
him
will
be
exempt
from
floggings
for
three
months
aha
do
you
remember
his
description
asked
the
visayan
i
should
say
so
height
tall
according
to
the
alferez
medium
according
to
padre
damaso
color
brown
eyes
black
nose
ordinary
beard
none
hair
black
aha
but
special
marks
black
shirt
black
pantaloons
aha
he
wo
get
away
from
me
i
think
i
see
him
now
i
would
mistake
him
for
any
one
else
even
though
he
might
look
like
him
thus
the
two
soldiers
continued
on
their
round
by
the
light
of
the
lanterns
we
may
again
see
two
shadowy
figures
moving
cautiously
along
one
behind
the
other
an
energetic
vive
stops
both
and
the
first
answers
in
a
trembling
voice
the
soldiers
seize
him
and
hustle
him
toward
a
lantern
to
examine
him
it
is
lucas
but
the
soldiers
seem
to
be
in
doubt
questioning
each
other
with
their
eyes
the
alferez
did
say
that
he
had
a
scar
whispered
the
visayan
where
you
going
to
order
a
mass
for
tomorrow
have
you
seen
elias
i
do
know
him
sir
answered
lucas
i
did
ask
you
if
you
know
him
you
fool
neither
do
we
know
him
i
asking
you
if
you
seen
him
no
sir
listen
i
describe
him
height
sometimes
tall
sometimes
medium
hair
and
eyes
black
all
the
other
features
ordinary
recited
the
visayan
now
do
you
know
him
no
sir
replied
lucas
stupidly
then
get
away
from
here
brute
dolt
and
they
gave
him
a
shove
do
you
know
why
elias
is
tall
to
the
alferez
and
of
medium
height
to
the
curate
asked
the
tagalog
thoughtfully
no
answered
the
visayan
because
the
alferez
was
down
in
the
mudhole
when
he
saw
him
and
the
curate
was
on
foot
that
right
exclaimed
the
visayan
you
talented
blow
is
it
that
you
a
i
was
always
one
i
was
a
smuggler
answered
the
tagalog
with
a
touch
of
pride
but
another
shadowy
figure
diverted
their
attention
they
challenged
this
one
also
and
took
the
man
to
the
light
this
time
it
was
the
real
elias
where
you
going
to
look
for
a
man
sir
who
beat
and
threatened
my
brother
he
has
a
scar
on
his
face
and
is
called
elias
aha
exclaimed
the
two
guards
gazing
at
each
other
in
astonishment
as
they
started
on
the
run
toward
the
church
where
lucas
had
disappeared
a
few
moments
before
chapter
liii
il
buon
dí
si
conosce
da
mattina
early
the
next
morning
the
report
spread
through
the
town
that
many
lights
had
been
seen
in
the
cemetery
on
the
previous
night
the
leader
of
the
venerable
tertiary
order
spoke
of
lighted
candles
of
their
shape
and
size
and
although
he
could
not
fix
the
exact
number
had
counted
more
than
twenty
sister
sipa
of
the
brotherhood
of
the
holy
rosary
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
a
member
of
a
rival
order
should
alone
boast
of
having
seen
this
divine
marvel
so
she
even
though
she
did
not
live
near
the
place
had
heard
cries
and
groans
and
even
thought
she
recognized
by
their
voices
certain
persons
with
whom
she
in
other
times
but
out
of
christian
charity
she
not
only
forgave
them
but
prayed
for
them
and
would
keep
their
names
secret
for
all
of
which
she
was
declared
on
the
spot
to
be
a
saint
sister
rufa
was
not
so
keen
of
hearing
but
she
could
not
suffer
that
sister
sipa
had
heard
so
much
and
she
nothing
so
she
related
a
dream
in
which
there
had
appeared
before
her
many
souls
not
only
of
the
dead
but
even
of
the
living
souls
in
torment
who
begged
for
a
part
of
those
indulgences
of
hers
which
were
so
carefully
recorded
and
treasured
she
could
furnish
names
to
the
families
interested
and
only
asked
for
a
few
alms
to
succor
the
pope
in
his
needs
a
little
fellow
a
herder
who
dared
to
assert
that
he
had
seen
nothing
more
than
one
light
and
two
men
in
salakots
had
difficulty
in
escaping
with
mere
slaps
and
scoldings
vainly
he
swore
to
it
there
were
his
carabaos
with
him
and
could
verify
his
statement
do
you
pretend
to
know
more
than
the
warden
and
the
sisters
heretic
he
was
asked
amid
angry
looks
the
curate
went
up
into
the
pulpit
and
preached
about
purgatory
so
fervently
that
the
pesos
again
flowed
forth
from
their
to
pay
for
masses
but
let
us
leave
the
suffering
souls
and
listen
to
the
conversation
between
don
filipo
and
old
tasio
in
the
lonely
home
of
the
latter
the
sage
or
lunatic
was
sick
having
been
for
days
unable
to
leave
his
bed
prostrated
by
a
malady
that
was
rapidly
growing
worse
really
i
do
know
whether
to
congratulate
you
or
not
that
your
resignation
has
been
accepted
formerly
when
the
gobernadorcillo
so
shamelessly
disregarded
the
will
of
the
majority
it
was
right
for
you
to
tender
it
but
now
that
you
are
engaged
in
a
contest
with
the
civil
guard
it
not
quite
proper
in
time
of
war
you
ought
to
remain
at
your
post
yes
but
not
when
the
general
sells
himself
answered
don
filipo
you
know
that
on
the
following
morning
the
gobernadorcillo
liberated
the
soldiers
that
i
had
succeeded
in
arresting
and
refused
to
take
any
further
action
without
the
consent
of
my
superior
officer
i
could
do
nothing
you
alone
nothing
but
with
the
rest
much
you
should
have
taken
advantage
of
this
opportunity
to
set
an
example
to
the
other
towns
above
the
ridiculous
authority
of
the
gobernadorcillo
are
the
rights
of
the
people
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
good
lesson
and
you
have
neglected
it
but
what
could
i
have
done
against
the
representative
of
the
interests
here
you
have
señor
ibarra
he
has
bowed
before
the
beliefs
of
the
crowd
do
you
think
that
he
believes
in
excommunications
you
are
not
in
the
same
fix
señor
ibarra
is
trying
to
sow
the
good
seed
and
to
do
so
he
must
bend
himself
and
make
what
use
he
can
of
the
material
at
hand
your
mission
was
to
stir
things
up
and
for
that
purpose
initiative
and
force
are
required
besides
the
fight
should
not
be
considered
as
merely
against
the
gobernadorcillo
the
principle
ought
to
be
against
him
who
makes
wrong
use
of
his
authority
against
him
who
disturbs
the
public
peace
against
him
who
fails
in
his
duty
you
would
not
have
been
alone
for
the
country
is
not
the
same
now
that
it
was
twenty
years
ago
do
you
think
so
asked
don
filipo
do
you
feel
it
rejoined
the
old
man
sitting
up
in
his
bed
ah
that
is
because
you
have
seen
the
past
you
have
studied
the
effect
of
european
immigration
of
the
coming
of
new
books
and
of
the
movement
of
our
youth
to
europe
examine
and
compare
these
facts
it
is
true
that
the
royal
and
pontifical
university
of
santo
tomas
with
its
most
sapient
faculty
still
exists
and
that
some
intelligences
are
yet
exercised
in
formulating
distinctions
and
in
penetrating
the
subtleties
of
scholasticism
but
where
will
you
now
find
the
metaphysical
youth
of
our
days
with
their
archaic
education
who
tortured
their
brains
and
died
in
full
pursuit
of
sophistries
in
some
corner
of
the
provinces
without
ever
having
succeeded
in
understanding
the
attributes
of
or
solving
the
problem
of
and
those
lofty
concepts
that
made
us
forget
what
was
essential
our
own
existence
and
our
own
individuality
look
at
the
youth
of
today
full
of
enthusiasm
at
the
view
of
a
wider
horizon
they
study
history
mathematics
geography
literature
physical
sciences
languages
all
subjects
that
in
our
times
we
heard
mentioned
with
horror
as
though
they
were
heresies
the
greatest
of
my
day
declared
them
inferior
to
the
classifications
of
aristotle
and
the
laws
of
the
syllogism
man
has
at
last
comprehended
that
he
is
man
he
has
given
up
analyzing
his
god
and
searching
into
the
imperceptible
into
what
he
has
not
seen
he
has
given
up
framing
laws
for
the
phantasms
of
his
brain
he
comprehends
that
his
heritage
is
the
vast
world
dominion
over
which
is
within
his
reach
weary
of
his
useless
and
presumptuous
toil
he
lowers
his
head
and
examines
what
surrounds
him
see
how
poets
are
now
springing
up
among
us
the
muses
of
nature
are
gradually
opening
up
their
treasures
to
us
and
begin
to
smile
in
encouragement
on
our
efforts
the
experimental
sciences
have
already
borne
their
time
only
is
lacking
for
their
development
the
lawyers
of
today
are
being
trained
in
the
new
forms
of
the
philosophy
of
law
some
of
them
begin
to
shine
in
the
midst
of
the
shadows
which
surround
our
courts
of
justice
indicating
a
change
in
the
course
of
affairs
hear
how
the
youth
talk
visit
the
centers
of
learning
other
names
resound
within
the
walls
of
the
schools
there
where
we
heard
only
those
of
thomas
suarez
amat
sanchez
and
others
who
were
the
idols
of
our
times
in
vain
do
the
friars
cry
out
from
the
pulpits
against
our
demoralization
as
the
cry
out
against
the
cupidity
of
their
customers
disregarding
the
fact
that
their
wares
are
stale
and
unserviceable
in
vain
do
the
conventos
extend
their
ramifications
to
check
the
new
current
the
gods
are
going
the
roots
of
the
tree
may
weaken
the
plants
that
support
themselves
under
it
but
they
can
not
take
away
life
from
those
other
beings
which
like
birds
are
soaring
toward
the
sky
the
sage
spoke
with
animation
his
eyes
gleamed
still
the
new
seed
is
small
objected
don
filipo
incredulously
if
all
enter
upon
the
progress
we
purchase
so
dearly
it
may
be
stifled
stifled
who
will
stifle
it
man
that
weak
dwarf
stifle
progress
the
powerful
child
of
time
and
action
when
has
he
been
able
to
do
so
bigotry
the
gibbet
the
stake
by
endeavoring
to
stifle
it
have
hurried
it
along
pur
si
said
galileo
when
the
dominicans
forced
him
to
declare
that
the
earth
does
not
move
and
the
same
statement
might
be
applied
to
human
progress
some
wills
are
broken
down
some
individuals
sacrificed
but
that
is
of
little
import
progress
continues
on
its
way
and
from
the
blood
of
those
who
fall
new
and
vigorous
offspring
is
born
see
the
press
itself
however
backward
it
may
wish
to
be
is
taking
a
step
forward
the
dominicans
themselves
do
not
escape
the
operation
of
this
law
but
are
imitating
the
jesuits
their
irreconcilable
enemies
they
hold
fiestas
in
their
cloisters
they
erect
little
theaters
they
compose
poems
because
as
they
are
not
devoid
of
intelligence
in
spite
of
believing
in
the
fifteenth
century
they
realize
that
the
jesuits
are
right
and
they
will
still
take
part
in
the
future
of
the
younger
peoples
that
they
have
reared
so
according
to
you
the
jesuits
keep
up
with
progress
asked
don
filipo
in
wonder
why
then
are
they
opposed
in
europe
i
will
answer
you
like
an
old
scholastic
replied
the
sage
lying
down
again
and
resuming
his
jesting
expression
there
are
three
ways
in
which
one
may
accompany
the
course
of
progress
in
front
of
beside
or
behind
it
the
first
guide
it
the
second
suffer
themselves
to
be
carried
along
with
it
and
the
last
are
dragged
after
it
and
to
these
last
the
jesuits
belong
they
would
like
to
direct
it
but
as
they
see
that
it
is
strong
and
has
other
tendencies
they
capitulate
preferring
to
follow
rather
than
to
be
crushed
or
left
alone
among
the
shadows
by
the
wayside
well
now
we
in
the
philippines
are
moving
along
at
least
three
centuries
behind
the
car
of
progress
we
are
barely
beginning
to
emerge
from
the
middle
ages
hence
the
jesuits
who
are
reactionary
in
europe
when
seen
from
our
point
of
view
represent
progress
to
them
the
philippines
owes
her
dawning
system
of
instruction
in
the
natural
sciences
the
soul
of
the
nineteenth
century
as
she
owed
to
the
dominicans
scholasticism
already
dead
in
spite
of
leo
xiii
for
there
is
no
pope
who
can
revive
what
common
sense
has
judged
and
condemned
but
where
are
we
getting
to
he
asked
with
a
change
of
tone
ah
we
were
speaking
of
the
present
condition
of
the
philippines
yes
we
are
now
entering
upon
a
period
of
strife
or
rather
i
should
say
that
you
are
for
my
generation
belongs
to
the
night
we
are
passing
away
this
strife
is
between
the
past
which
seizes
and
strives
with
curses
to
cling
to
the
tottering
feudal
castle
and
the
future
whose
song
of
triumph
may
be
heard
from
afar
amid
the
splendors
of
the
coming
dawn
bringing
the
message
of
from
other
lands
who
will
fall
and
be
buried
in
the
moldering
ruins
the
old
man
paused
noticing
that
don
filipo
was
gazing
at
him
thoughtfully
he
said
with
a
smile
i
can
almost
guess
what
you
are
thinking
really
you
are
thinking
of
how
easily
i
may
be
mistaken
was
the
answer
with
a
sad
smile
today
i
am
feverish
and
i
am
not
infallible
sum
et
nihil
humani
a
me
alienum
said
terence
and
if
at
any
time
one
is
allowed
to
dream
why
not
dream
pleasantly
in
the
last
hours
of
life
and
after
all
i
have
lived
only
in
dreams
you
are
right
it
is
a
dream
our
youths
think
only
of
love
affairs
and
dissipations
they
expend
more
time
and
work
harder
to
deceive
and
dishonor
a
maiden
than
in
thinking
about
the
welfare
of
their
country
our
women
in
order
to
care
for
the
house
and
family
of
god
neglect
their
own
our
men
are
active
only
in
vice
and
heroic
only
in
shame
childhood
develops
amid
ignorance
and
routine
youth
lives
its
best
years
without
ideals
and
a
sterile
manhood
serves
only
as
an
example
for
corrupting
youth
gladly
do
i
die
iam
rivos
pueri
do
you
want
some
medicine
asked
don
filipo
in
order
to
change
the
course
of
the
conversation
which
had
darkened
the
old
man
face
the
dying
need
no
medicines
you
who
remain
need
them
tell
don
crisostomo
to
come
and
see
me
tomorrow
for
i
have
some
important
things
to
say
to
him
in
a
few
days
i
am
going
away
the
philippines
is
in
darkness
after
a
few
moments
more
of
talk
don
filipo
left
the
sick
man
house
grave
and
thoughtful
chapter
liv
revelations
quidquid
latet
adparebit
nil
inultum
remanebit
the
vesper
bells
are
ringing
and
at
the
holy
sound
all
pause
drop
their
tasks
and
uncover
the
laborer
returning
from
the
fields
ceases
the
song
with
which
he
was
pacing
his
carabao
and
murmurs
a
prayer
the
women
in
the
street
cross
themselves
and
move
their
lips
affectedly
so
that
none
may
doubt
their
piety
a
man
stops
caressing
his
and
recites
the
angelus
to
bring
better
luck
while
inside
the
houses
they
pray
aloud
every
sound
but
that
of
the
ave
maria
dies
away
becomes
hushed
nevertheless
the
curate
without
his
hat
rushes
across
the
street
to
the
scandalizing
of
many
old
women
and
greater
scandal
still
directs
his
steps
toward
the
house
of
the
alferez
the
devout
women
then
think
it
time
to
cease
the
movement
of
their
lips
in
order
to
kiss
the
curate
hand
but
padre
salvi
takes
no
notice
of
them
this
evening
he
finds
no
pleasure
in
placing
his
bony
hand
on
his
christian
nose
that
he
may
slip
it
down
dissemblingly
as
doña
consolacion
has
observed
over
the
bosom
of
the
attractive
young
woman
who
may
have
bent
over
to
receive
his
blessing
some
important
matter
must
be
engaging
his
attention
when
he
thus
forgets
his
own
interests
and
those
of
the
church
in
fact
he
rushes
headlong
up
the
stairway
and
knocks
impatiently
at
the
alferez
door
the
latter
puts
in
his
appearance
scowling
followed
by
his
better
half
who
smiles
like
one
of
the
damned
ah
padre
i
was
just
going
over
to
see
you
that
old
goat
of
yours
i
have
a
very
important
matter
i
ca
stand
for
his
running
about
and
breaking
down
the
fence
shoot
him
if
he
comes
back
that
is
if
you
are
alive
tomorrow
exclaimed
the
panting
curate
as
he
made
his
way
toward
the
sala
what
do
you
think
that
puny
doll
will
kill
me
i
bust
him
with
a
kick
padre
salvi
stepped
backward
with
an
involuntary
glance
toward
the
alferez
feet
whom
are
you
talking
about
he
asked
tremblingly
about
whom
would
i
talk
but
that
simpleton
who
has
challenged
me
to
a
duel
with
revolvers
at
a
hundred
paces
ah
sighed
the
curate
then
he
added
i
come
to
talk
to
you
about
a
very
urgent
matter
enough
of
urgent
matters
it
be
like
that
affair
of
the
two
boys
had
the
light
been
other
than
from
coconut
oil
and
the
lamp
globe
not
so
dirty
the
alferez
would
have
noticed
the
curate
pallor
now
this
is
a
serious
matter
which
concerns
the
lives
of
all
of
us
declared
padre
salvi
in
a
low
voice
a
serious
matter
echoed
the
alferez
turning
pale
can
that
boy
shoot
straight
i
not
talking
about
him
then
what
the
friar
made
a
sign
toward
the
door
which
the
alferez
closed
in
his
own
way
with
a
kick
for
he
had
found
his
hands
superfluous
and
had
lost
nothing
by
ceasing
to
be
bimanous
a
curse
and
a
roar
sounded
outside
brute
you
split
my
forehead
open
yelled
his
wife
now
unburden
yourself
he
said
calmly
to
the
curate
the
latter
stared
at
him
for
a
space
then
asked
in
the
nasal
droning
voice
of
the
preacher
did
you
see
me
come
running
sure
i
thought
you
lost
something
well
now
continued
the
curate
without
heeding
the
rudeness
when
i
fail
thus
in
my
duty
it
because
there
are
grave
reasons
well
what
else
asked
the
other
tapping
the
floor
with
his
foot
be
calm
then
why
did
you
come
in
such
a
hurry
the
curate
drew
nearer
to
him
and
asked
mysteriously
have
you
heard
anything
the
alferez
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
admit
that
you
know
absolutely
nothing
do
you
want
to
talk
about
elias
who
put
away
your
senior
sacristan
last
night
was
the
retort
no
i
not
talking
about
those
matters
answered
the
curate
i
talking
about
a
great
danger
well
damn
it
out
with
it
come
said
the
friar
slowly
and
disdainfully
you
see
once
more
how
important
we
ecclesiastics
are
the
meanest
lay
brother
is
worth
as
much
as
a
regiment
while
a
curate
then
he
added
in
a
low
and
mysterious
tone
i
discovered
a
big
conspiracy
the
alferez
started
up
and
gazed
in
astonishment
at
the
friar
a
terrible
and
plot
which
will
be
carried
out
this
very
night
this
very
night
exclaimed
the
alferez
pushing
the
curate
aside
and
running
to
his
revolver
and
sword
hanging
on
the
wall
who
i
arrest
who
i
arrest
he
cried
calm
yourself
there
is
still
time
thanks
to
the
promptness
with
which
i
have
acted
we
have
till
eight
i
shoot
all
of
them
this
afternoon
a
woman
whose
name
i
ca
reveal
it
a
secret
of
the
confessional
came
to
me
and
told
everything
at
eight
they
will
seize
the
barracks
by
surprise
plunder
the
convento
capture
the
police
boat
and
murder
all
of
us
spaniards
the
alferez
was
stupefied
the
woman
did
not
tell
me
any
more
than
this
added
the
curate
she
did
tell
any
more
then
i
arrest
her
i
ca
consent
to
that
the
bar
of
penitence
is
the
throne
of
the
god
of
mercies
there
neither
god
nor
mercies
that
amount
to
anything
arrest
her
you
losing
your
head
what
you
must
do
is
to
get
yourself
ready
muster
your
soldiers
quietly
and
put
them
in
ambush
send
me
four
guards
for
the
convento
and
notify
the
men
in
charge
of
the
boat
the
boat
is
here
i
ask
for
help
from
the
other
sections
no
for
then
the
plotters
would
be
warned
and
would
not
carry
out
their
plans
what
we
must
do
is
to
catch
them
alive
and
make
them
talk
i
mean
you
make
them
talk
since
i
as
a
priest
must
not
meddle
in
such
matters
listen
here
where
you
win
crosses
and
stars
i
ask
only
that
you
make
due
acknowledgment
that
it
was
i
who
warned
you
it
be
acknowledged
padre
it
be
acknowledged
and
perhaps
you
get
a
miter
answered
the
glowing
alferez
glancing
at
the
cuffs
of
his
uniform
so
you
send
me
four
guards
in
plain
clothes
eh
be
discreet
and
tonight
at
eight
it
rain
stars
and
crosses
while
all
this
was
taking
place
a
man
ran
along
the
road
leading
to
ibarra
house
and
rushed
up
the
stairway
is
your
master
here
the
voice
of
elias
called
to
a
servant
he
in
his
study
at
work
ibarra
to
divert
the
impatience
that
he
felt
while
waiting
for
the
time
when
he
could
make
his
explanations
to
maria
clara
had
set
himself
to
work
in
his
laboratory
ah
that
you
elias
he
exclaimed
i
was
thinking
about
you
yesterday
i
forgot
to
ask
you
the
name
of
that
spaniard
in
whose
house
your
grandfather
lived
let
not
talk
about
me
sir
look
continued
ibarra
not
noticing
the
youth
agitation
while
he
placed
a
piece
of
bamboo
over
a
flame
i
made
a
great
discovery
this
bamboo
is
incombustible
it
not
a
question
of
bamboo
now
sir
it
a
question
of
your
collecting
your
papers
and
fleeing
at
this
very
moment
ibarra
glanced
at
him
in
surprise
and
on
seeing
the
gravity
of
his
countenance
dropped
the
object
that
he
held
in
his
hands
burn
everything
that
may
compromise
you
and
within
an
hour
put
yourself
in
a
place
of
safety
why
ibarra
was
at
length
able
to
ask
put
all
your
valuables
in
a
safe
place
why
burn
every
letter
written
by
you
or
to
you
the
most
innocent
thing
may
be
wrongly
construed
but
why
all
this
why
because
i
just
discovered
a
plot
that
is
to
be
attributed
to
you
in
order
to
ruin
you
a
plot
who
is
forming
it
i
have
been
able
to
discover
the
author
of
it
but
just
a
moment
ago
i
talked
with
one
of
the
poor
dupes
who
are
paid
to
carry
it
out
and
i
was
able
to
dissuade
him
but
he
did
he
tell
you
who
is
paying
him
yes
under
a
pledge
of
secrecy
he
said
that
it
was
you
my
god
exclaimed
the
terrified
ibarra
there
no
doubt
of
it
sir
do
lose
any
time
for
the
plot
will
probably
be
carried
out
this
very
night
ibarra
with
his
hands
on
his
head
and
his
eyes
staring
unnaturally
seemed
not
to
hear
him
the
blow
can
not
be
averted
continued
elias
i
come
late
i
do
know
who
the
leaders
are
save
yourself
sir
save
yourself
for
your
country
sake
whither
shall
i
flee
she
expects
me
tonight
exclaimed
ibarra
thinking
of
maria
clara
to
any
town
whatsoever
to
manila
to
the
house
of
some
official
but
anywhere
so
that
they
may
not
say
that
you
are
directing
this
movement
suppose
that
i
myself
report
the
plot
you
an
informer
exclaimed
elias
stepping
back
and
staring
at
him
you
would
appear
as
a
traitor
and
coward
in
the
eyes
of
the
plotters
and
in
the
eyes
of
others
they
would
say
that
you
planned
the
whole
thing
to
curry
favor
they
would
say
but
what
to
be
done
i
already
told
you
destroy
every
document
that
relates
to
your
affairs
flee
and
await
the
outcome
and
maria
clara
exclaimed
the
young
man
no
i
die
first
elias
wrung
his
hands
saying
well
then
at
least
parry
the
blow
prepare
for
the
time
when
they
accuse
you
ibarra
gazed
about
him
in
bewilderment
then
help
me
there
in
that
are
all
the
letters

ones

compromise

read
the
signatures
so
the
bewildered
and
stupefied
young
man
opened
and
shut
boxes
collected
papers
read
letters
hurriedly
tearing
up
some
and
laying
others
aside
he
took
down
some
books
and
began
to
turn
their
leaves
elias
did
the
same
if
not
so
excitedly
yet
with
equal
eagerness
but
suddenly
he
paused
his
eyes
bulged
he
turned
the
paper
in
his
hand
over
and
over
then
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
was
your
family
acquainted
with
don
pedro
eibarramendia
i
should
say
so
answered
ibarra
as
he
opened
a
chest
and
took
out
a
bundle
of
papers
he
was
my
your
don
pedro
eibarramendia
again
asked
elias
with
changed
and
livid
features
yes
replied
ibarra
absently
we
shortened
the
surname
it
was
too
long
was
he
a
basque
demanded
elias
approaching
him
yes
a
basque
but
what
the
matter
asked
ibarra
in
surprise
clenching
his
fists
and
pressing
them
to
his
forehead
elias
glared
at
crisostomo
who
recoiled
when
he
saw
the
expression
on
the
face
do
you
know
who
don
pedro
eibarramendia
was
he
asked
between
his
teeth
don
pedro
eibarramendia
was
the
villain
who
falsely
accused
my
grandfather
and
caused
all
our
misfortunes
i
have
sought
for
that
name
and
god
has
revealed
it
to
me
render
me
now
an
accounting
for
our
misfortunes
elias
caught
and
shook
the
arm
of
crisostomo
who
gazed
at
him
in
terror
in
a
voice
that
was
bitter
and
trembling
with
hate
he
said
look
at
me
well
look
at
one
who
has
suffered
and
you
live
you
live
you
have
wealth
a
home
reputation
you
live
you
live
beside
himself
he
ran
to
a
small
collection
of
arms
and
snatched
up
a
dagger
but
scarcely
had
he
done
so
when
he
let
it
fall
again
and
stared
like
a
madman
at
the
motionless
ibarra
what
was
i
about
to
do
he
muttered
fleeing
from
the
house
chapter

the
catastrophe
there
in
the
capitan
tiago
linares
and
aunt
isabel
were
at
supper
so
that
even
in
the
sala
the
rattling
of
plates
and
dishes
was
plainly
heard
maria
clara
had
said
that
she
was
not
hungry
and
had
seated
herself
at
the
piano
in
company
with
the
merry
sinang
who
was
murmuring
mysterious
words
into
her
ear
meanwhile
padre
salvi
paced
nervously
back
and
forth
in
the
room
it
was
not
indeed
that
the
convalescent
was
not
hungry
no
but
she
was
expecting
the
arrival
of
a
certain
person
and
was
taking
advantage
of
this
moment
when
her
argus
was
not
present
linares
you
see
how
that
specter
will
stay
till
eight
murmured
sinang
indicating
the
curate
and
at
eight
will
come
the
curate
in
love
with
linares
maria
clara
gazed
in
consternation
at
her
friend
who
went
on
heedlessly
with
her
terrible
chatter
oh
i
know
why
he
go
in
spite
of
my
hints
he
does
want
to
burn
up
oil
in
the

do
you
know
that
since
you
been
sick
the
two
lamps
that
he
used
to
keep
lighted
he
has
had
put
out
but
look
how
he
stares
and
what
a
face
at
that
moment
a
clock
in
the
house
struck

the
curate
shuddered
and
sat
down
in
a
corner
here
he
comes
exclaimed
sinang
pinching
maria
clara
do
you
hear
him
the
church
bell
boomed
out
the
hour
of
eight
and
all
rose
to
pray
padre
salvi
offered
up
a
prayer
in
a
weak
and
trembling
voice
but
as
each
was
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
the
priest
agitation
scarcely
had
the
prayer
ceased
when
ibarra
appeared
the
youth
was
in
mourning
not
only
in
his
attire
but
also
in
his
face
to
such
an
extent
that
on
seeing
him
maria
clara
arose
and
took
a
step
toward
him
to
ask
what
the
matter
was
but
at
that
instant
the
report
of
firearms
was
heard
ibarra
stopped
his
eyes
rolled
he
lost
the
power
of
speech
the
curate
had
concealed
himself
behind
a
post
more
shots
more
reports
were
heard
from
the
direction
of
the
convento
followed
by
cries
and
the
sound
of
persons
running

and

of

armed
with

and
maria

were
in
each

while
the
only
one
that
remained
motionless
as
if
petrified
was
crisostomo
whose
paleness
was
indescribable
the
cries
and
sound
of
blows
continued

closed
noisily
the

fifty

and

responded

gradually
there
prevailed
a
heavy
silence
which
was
soon
broken
by
the
voice
of
the
alferez
calling
as
he
ran
padre
padre

come
here
the
alferez
is
calling
for
confession
cried
aunt

the
alferez

asked

hastily
ah

then
did
he
notice
that
he
had
not
yet
swallowed
what
he
had
in
his
mouth
padre
come
here
there
nothing
more
to
fear
the
alferez
continued
to
call
out
the
pallid
fray
salvi
at
last
concluded
to
venture
out
from
his
and
went
down

also
turned
toward
the
stairway
in
spite
of
aunt
cries
do
go
out
you
have
been
shriven
do
go
out
the
good
old
lady
had
been
a
particular
friend
of
his
mother
but
ibarra
left
the
house
everything
seemed
to
reel
around
him
the
ground
was
unstable
his
ears
buzzed
his
legs
moved
heavily
and
irregularly
waves
of
blood
lights
and
shadows
chased
one
another
before
his
eyes
and
in
spite
of
the
bright
moonlight
he
stumbled
over
the
stones
and
blocks
of
wood
in
the
vacant
and
deserted
street
near
the
barracks
he
saw
soldiers
with
bayonets
fixed
who
were
talking
among
themselves
so
excitedly
that
he
passed
them
unnoticed
in
the
town
hall
were
to
be
heard
blows
cries
and
curses
with
the
voice
of
the
alferez
dominating
everything
to
the
stocks
handcuff
them
shoot
any
one
who
moves
sergeant
mount
the
guard
today
no
one
shall
walk
about
not
even

captain
this
is
no
time
to
go
to
sleep
ibarra
hastened
his
steps
toward
home
where
his
servants
were
anxiously
awaiting
him
saddle
the
best
horse
and
go
to
bed
he
ordered
them
going
into
his
study
he
hastily
packed
a
opened
an
iron
safe
took
out
what
money
he
found
there
and
put
it
into
some
sacks
then
he
collected
his
jewels
took
clown
a
portrait
of
maria
clara
armed
himself
with
a
dagger
and
two
revolvers
and
turned
toward
a
closet
where
he
kept
his
instruments
at
that
moment
three
heavy
knocks
sounded
on
the
door
there
asked
ibarra
in
a
gloomy
tone
open
in
the
king
name
open
at
once
or
we
break
the
door
down
answered
an
imperious
voice
in
spanish
ibarra
looked
toward
the
window
his
eyes
gleamed
and
he
cocked
his
revolver
then
changing
his
mind
he
put
the
weapons
down
and
went
to
open
the
door
just
as
the
servant
appeared
three
guards
instantly
seized
him
consider
yourself
a
prisoner
in
the
king
name
said
the
sergeant
for
what
they
tell
you
over
there
we
forbidden
to
say
the
youth
reflected
a
moment
and
then
perhaps
not
wishing
that
the
soldiers
should
discover
his
preparations
for
flight
picked
up
his
hat
saying
i
at
your
service
i
suppose
that
it
will
only
be
for
a
few
hours
if
you
promise
not
to
try
to
escape
we
wo
tie
you
the
alferez
grants
this
favor
but
if
you
run
ibarra
went
with
them
leaving
his
servants
in
consternation
meanwhile
what
had
become
of
elias
leaving
the
house
of
crisostomo
he
had
run
like
one
crazed
without
heeding
where
he
was
going
he
crossed
the
fields
in
violent
agitation
he
reached
the
woods
he
fled
from
the
town
from
the
light
even
the
moon
so
troubled
him
that
he
plunged
into
the
mysterious
shadows
of
the
trees
there
sometimes
pausing
sometimes
moving
along
unfrequented
paths
supporting
himself
on
the
hoary
trunks
or
being
entangled
in
the
undergrowth
he
gazed
toward
the
town
which
bathed
in
the
light
of
the
moon
spread
out
before
him
on
the
plain
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
birds
awakened
from
their
sleep
flew
about
huge
bats
and
owls
moved
from
branch
to
branch
with
strident
cries
and
gazed
at
him
with
their
round
eyes
but
elias
neither
heard
nor
heeded
them
in
his
fancy
he
was
followed
by
the
offended
shades
of
his
family
he
saw
on
every
branch
the
gruesome
basket
containing
balat
gory
head
as
his
father
had
described
it
to
him
at
every
tree
he
seemed
to
stumble
over
the
corpse
of
his
grandmother
he
imagined
that
he
saw
the
rotting
skeleton
of
his
dishonored
grandfather
swinging
among
the
shadows
and
the
skeleton
and
the
corpse
and
the
gory
head
cried
after
him
coward
coward
leaving
the
hill
elias
descended
to
the
lake
and
ran
along
the
shore
excitedly
there
at
a
distance
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
where
the
moonlight
seemed
to
form
a
cloud
he
thought
he
could
see
a
specter
rise
and
soar
the
shade
of
his
sister
with
her
breast
bloody
and
her
loose
hair
streaming
about
he
fell
to
his
knees
on
the
sand
and
extending
his
arms
cried
out
you
too
then
with
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
cloud
he
arose
slowly
and
went
forward
into
the
water
as
if
he
were
following
some
one
he
passed
over
the
gentle
slope
that
forms
the
bar
and
was
soon
far
from
the
shore
the
water
rose
to
his
waist
but
he
plunged
on
like
one
fascinated
following
ever
following
the
ghostly
charmer
now
the
water
covered
his
chest
a
volley
of
sounded
the
vision
disappeared
the
youth
returned
to
his
senses
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
and
the
greater
density
of
the
air
the
reports
reached
him
clearly
and
distinctly
he
stopped
to
reflect
and
found
himself
in
the
water
over
the
peaceful
ripples
of
the
lake
he
could
still
make
out
the
lights
in
the
fishermen
huts
he
returned
to
the
shore
and
started
toward
the
town
but
for
what
purpose
he
himself
knew
not
the
streets
appeared
to
be
deserted
the
houses
were
closed
and
even
the
dogs
that
were
wont
to
bark
through
the
night
had
hidden
themselves
in
fear
the
silvery
light
of
the
moon
added
to
the
sadness
and
loneliness
fearful
of
meeting
the
he
made
his
way
along
through
yards
and
gardens
in
one
of
which
he
thought
he
could
discern
two
human
figures
but
he
kept
on
his
way
leaping
over
fences
and
walls
until
after
great
labor
he
reached
the
other
end
of
the
town
and
went
toward
crisostomo
house
in
the
doorway
were
the
servants
lamenting
their
master
arrest
after
learning
about
what
had
occurred
elias
pretended
to
go
away
but
really
went
around
behind
the
house
jumped
over
the
wall
and
crawled
through
a
window
into
the
study
where
the
candle
that
ibarra
had
lighted
was
still
burning
he
saw
the
books
and
papers
and
found
the
arms
the
jewels
and
the
sacks
of
money
reconstructing
in
his
imagination
the
scene
that
had
taken
place
there
and
seeing
so
many
papers
that
might
be
of
a
compromising
nature
he
decided
to
gather
them
up
throw
them
from
the
window
and
bury
them
but
on
glancing
toward
the
street
he
saw
two
guards
approaching
their
bayonets
and
caps
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
with
them
was
the
directorcillo
he
made
a
sudden
resolution
throwing
the
papers
and
some
clothing
into
a
heap
in
the
center
of
the
room
he
poured
over
them
the
oil
from
a
lamp
and
set
fire
to
the
whole
he
was
hurriedly
placing
the
arms
in
his
belt
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
portrait
of
maria
clara
and
hesitated
a
moment
then
thrust
it
into
one
of
the
sacks
and
with
them
in
his
hands
leaped
from
the
window
into
the
garden
it
was
time
that
he
did
so
too
for
the
guards
were
forcing
an
entrance
let
us
in
to
get
your
master
papers
cried
the
directorcillo
have
you
permission
if
you
have
you
wo
get
in
answered
an
old
man
but
the
soldiers
pushed
him
aside
with
the
butts
of
their
rifles
and
ran
up
the
stairway
just
as
a
thick
cloud
of
smoke
rolled
through
the
house
and
long
tongues
of
flame
shot
out
from
the
study
enveloping
the
doors
and
windows
fire
fire
was
the
cry
as
each
rushed
to
save
what
he
could
but
the
blaze
had
reached
the
little
laboratory
and
caught
the
inflammable
materials
there
so
the
guards
had
to
retire
the
flames
roared
about
licking
up
everything
in
their
way
and
cutting
off
the
passages
vainly
was
water
brought
from
the
well
and
cries
for
help
raised
for
the
house
was
set
apart
from
the
rest
the
fire
swept
through
all
the
rooms
and
sent
toward
the
sky
thick
spirals
of
smoke
soon
the
whole
structure
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
flames
fanned
now
by
the
wind
which
in
the
heat
grew
stronger
some
few
rustics
came
up
but
only
to
gaze
on
this
great
bonfire
the
end
of
that
old
building
which
had
been
so
long
respected
by
the
elements
chapter

rumors
and
beliefs
day
dawned
at
last
for
the
terrified
town
the
streets
near
the
barracks
and
the
town
hail
were
still
deserted
and
solitary
the
houses
showed
no
signs
of
life
nevertheless
the
wooden
panel
of
a
window
was
pushed
back
noisily
and
a
child
head
was
stretched
out
and
turned
from
side
to
side
gazing
about
in
all
directions
at
once
however
a
smack
indicated
the
contact
of
tanned
hide
with
the
soft
human
article
so
the
child
made
a
wry
face
closed
its
eyes
and
disappeared
the
window
slammed
shut
but
an
example
had
been
set
that
opening
and
shutting
of
the
window
had
no
doubt
been
heard
on
all
sides
for
soon
another
window
opened
slowly
and
there
appeared
cautiously
the
head
of
a
wrinkled
and
toothless
old
woman
it
was
the
same
sister
puté
who
had
raised
such
a
disturbance
while
padre
damaso
was
preaching
children
and
old
women
are
the
representatives
of
curiosity
in
this
world
the
former
from
a
wish
to
know
things
and
the
latter
from
a
desire
to
recollect
them
apparently
there
was
no
one
to
apply
a
slipper
to
sister
puté
for
she
remained
gazing
out
into
the
distance
with
wrinkled
eyebrows
then
she
rinsed
out
her
mouth
spat
noisily
and
crossed
herself
in
the
house
opposite
another
window
was
now
timidly
opened
to
reveal
sister
rufa
she
who
did
not
wish
to
cheat
or
be
cheated
they
stared
at
each
other
for
a
moment
smiled
made
some
signs
and
again
crossed
themselves
it
seemed
like
a
thanksgiving
mass
regular

commented

were

opened

more
faces
appeared
to
exchange
greetings
and
make
comments
in
the
clear
light
which
promised
a
bright
day
soldiers
could
be
seen
in
the
distance
coming
and
going

the
exclamation
from

and
i
but
really
can
it
be
you
do
know
what
it
was
asked
a
individual
oh
the
cuadrilleros
no
sir
it
was
a
mutiny
in
the
barracks
what
kind
of
mutiny
the
curate
against
the
alferez
no
it
was
nothing
of
the
kind
answered
the
man
who
had
asked
the
first
question
it
was
the
chinamen
who
have
rebelled
with
this
he
shut
his
window
the
chinamen
echoed
all
in
great
astonishment
that
why
not
one
of
them
is
to
be
seen
they
probably
killed
them
all
i
thought
they
were
going
to
do
something
bad
yesterday
i
saw
it
myself
last
night
what
a
pity
exclaimed
sister
rufa
to
get
killed
just
before
christmas
when
they
bring
around
their
presents
they
should
have
waited
until
new
year
little
by
little
the
street
awoke
to
life
dogs
chickens
pigs
and
doves
began
the
movement
and
these
animals
were
soon
followed
by
some
ragged
urchins
who
held
fast
to
each
other
arms
as
they
timidly
approached
the
barracks
then
a
few
old
women
with
handkerchiefs
tied
about
their
heads
and
fastened
under
their
chins
appeared
with
thick
rosaries
in
their
hands
pretending
to
be
at
their
prayers
so
that
the
soldiers
would
let
them
pass
when
it
was
seen
that
one
might
walk
about
without
being
shot
at
the
men
began
to
come
out
with
assumed
airs
of
indifference
first
they
limited
their
steps
to
the
neighborhood
of
their
houses
caressing
their
then
they
extended
their
stroll
stopping
from
time
to
time
until
at
last
they
stood
in
front
of
the
town
hall
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
other
versions
of
the
affair
were
in
circulation
ibarra
with
his
servants
had
tried
to
kidnap
maria
clara
and
capitan
tiago
had
defended
her
aided
by
the
civil
guard
the
number
of
killed
was
now
not
fourteen
but
thirty
capitan
tiago
was
wounded
and
would
leave
that
very
day
with
his
family
for
manila
the
arrival
of
two
cuadrilleros
carrying
a
human
form
on
a
covered
stretcher
and
followed
by
a
produced
a
great
sensation
it
was
conjectured
that
they
came
from
the
convento
and
from
the
shape
of
the
feet
which
were
dangling
over
one
end
some
guessed
who
the
dead
man
might
be
some
one
else
a
little
distance
away
told
who
it
was
further
on
the
corpse
was
multiplied
and
the
mystery
of
the
holy
trinity
duplicated
later
the
miracle
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
was
repeated
and
the
dead
were
then
thirty
and
eight
by
seven
when
other
guards
arrived
from
neighboring
towns
the
current
version
was
clear
and
detailed
i
just
come
from
the
town
hall
where
i
seen
don
filipo
and
don
crisostomo
prisoners
a
man
told
sister
puté
i
talked
with
one
of
the
cuadrilleros
who
are
on
guard
well
bruno
the
son
of
that
fellow
who
was
flogged
to
death
confessed
everything
last
night
as
you
know
capitan
tiago
is
going
to
marry
his
daughter
to
the
young
spaniard
so
don
crisostomo
in
his
rage
wanted
to
get
revenge
and
tried
to
kill
all
the
spaniards
even
the
curate
last
night
they
attacked
the
barracks
and
the
convento
but
fortunately
by
god
mercy
the
curate
was
in
capitan
house
they
say
that
a
lot
of
them
escaped
the
burned
don
crisostomo
house
down
and
if
they
had
arrested
him
first
they
would
have
burned
him
also
they
burned
the
house
down
all
the
servants
are
under
arrest
look
you
can
still
see
the
smoke
from
here
answered
the
narrator
approaching
the
window
those
who
come
from
there
tell
of
many
sad
things
all
looked
toward
the
place
indicated
a
thin
column
of
smoke
was
still
slowly
rising
toward
the
sky
all
made
comments
more
or
less
pitying
more
or
less
accusing
poor
youth
exclaimed
an
old
man
puté
husband
yes
she
answered
but
look
how
he
did
order
a
mass
said
for
the
soul
of
his
father
who
undoubtedly
needs
it
more
than
others
but
woman
have
you
any
pity
pity
for
the
excommunicated
it
a
sin
to
take
pity
on
the
enemies
of
god
the
curates
say
do
you
remember
in
the
cemetery
he
walked
about
as
if
he
was
in
a
corral
but
a
corral
and
the
cemetery
are
alike
replied
the
old
man
only
that
into
the
former
only
one
kind
of
animal
enters
shut
up
cried
sister
puté
you
still
defend
those
whom
god
has
clearly
punished
you
see
how
they
arrest
you
too
upholding
a
falling
house
her
husband
became
silent
before
this
argument
yes
continued
the
old
lady
after
striking
padre
damaso
there
was
anything
left
for
him
to
do
but
to
kill
padre
salvi
but
you
ca
deny
that
he
was
good
when
he
was
a
little
boy
yes
he
was
good
replied
the
old
woman
but
he
went
to
spain
all
those
that
go
to
spain
become
heretics
as
the
curates
have
said
oho
exclaimed
her
husband
seeing
his
chance
for
a
retort
and
the
curate
and
all
the
curates
and
the
archbishop
and
the
pope
and
the
virgin
are
they
from
spain
are
they
also
heretics
happily
for
sister
puté
the
arrival
of
a
maidservant
running
all
pale
and
terrified
cut
short
this
discussion
a
man
hanged
in
the
next
garden
she
cried
breathlessly
a
man
hanged
exclaimed
all
in
stupefaction
the
women
crossed
themselves
no
one
could
move
from
his
place
yes
sir
went
on
the
trembling
servant
i
was
going
to
pick
peas
i
looked
into
our
neighbor
garden
to
see
if
it
was
i
saw
a
man
swinging
i
thought
it
was
teo
the
servant
who
always
gives
me
i
went
nearer
to
pick
the
peas
and
i
saw
that
it
was
teo
but
a
dead
man
i
ran
and
i
ran
and
let
go
see
him
said
the
old
man
rising
show
us
the
way
do
you
go
cried
sister
puté
catching
hold
of
his
camisa
something
will
happen
to
you
is
he
hanged
then
the
worse
for
him
let
me
see
him
woman
you
juan
go
to
the
barracks
and
report
it
perhaps
he
not
dead
yet
so
he
proceeded
to
the
garden
with
the
servant
who
kept
behind
him
the
women
including
even
sister
puté
herself
followed
after
filled
with
fear
and
curiosity
there
he
is
sir
said
the
servant
as
she
stopped
and
pointed
with
her
finger
the
committee
paused
at
a
respectful
distance
and
allowed
the
old
man
to
go
forward
alone
a
human
body
hanging
from
the
branch
of
a
santol
tree
swung
about
gently
in
the
breeze
the
old
man
stared
at
it
for
a
time
and
saw
that
the
legs
and
arms
were
stiff
the
clothing
soiled
and
the
head
doubled
over
we
must
touch
him
until
some
officer
of
the
law
arrives
he
said
aloud
he
already
stiff
he
been
dead
for
some
time
the
women
gradually
moved
closer
he
the
fellow
who
lived
in
that
little
house
there
he
came
here
two
weeks
ago
look
at
the
scar
on
his
face
maria
exclaimed
some
of
the
women
shall
we
pray
for
his
soul
asked
a
young
woman
after
she
had
finished
staring
and
examining
the
body
fool
heretic
scolded
sister
puté
do
you
know
what
padre
damaso
said
it
tempting
god
to
pray
for
one
of
the
damned
whoever
commits
suicide
is
irrevocably
damned
and
therefore
he
is
buried
in
holy
ground
then
she
added
i
knew
that
this
man
was
coming
to
a
bad
end
i
never
could
find
out
how
he
lived
i
saw
him
twice
talking
with
the
senior
sacristan
observed
a
young
woman
it
would
be
to
confess
himself
or
to
order
a
mass
other
neighbors
came
up
until
a
large
group
surrounded
the
corpse
which
was
still
swinging
about
after
half
an
hour
an
alguazil
and
the
directorcillo
arrived
with
two
cuadrilleros
who
took
the
body
down
and
placed
it
on
a
stretcher
people
are
getting
in
a
hurry
to
die
remarked
the
directorcillo
with
a
smile
as
he
took
a
pen
from
behind
his
ear
he
made
captious
inquiries
and
took
down
the
statement
of
the
maidservant
whom
he
tried
to
confuse
now
looking
at
her
fiercely
now
threatening
her
now
attributing
to
her
things
that
she
had
not
said
so
much
so
that
she
thinking
that
she
would
have
to
go
to
jail
began
to
cry
and
wound
up
by
declaring
that
she
was
looking
for
peas
but
and
she
called
teo
as
a
witness
while
this
was
taking
place
a
rustic
in
a
wide
salakot
with
a
big
bandage
on
his
neck
was
examining
the
corpse
and
the
rope
the
face
was
not
more
livid
than
the
rest
of
the
body
two
scratches
and
two
red
spots
were
to
be
seen
above
the
noose
the
strands
of
the
rope
were
white
and
had
no
blood
on
them
the
curious
rustic
carefully
examined
the
camisa
and
pantaloons
and
noticed
that
they
were
very
dusty
and
freshly
torn
in
some
parts
but
what
most
caught
his
attention
were
the
seeds
of
that
were
sticking
on
the
camisa
even
up
to
the
collar
what
are
you
looking
at
the
directorcillo
asked
him
i
was
looking
sir
to
see
if
i
could
recognize
him
stammered
the
rustic
partly
uncovering
but
in
such
a
way
that
his
salakot
fell
lower
but
have
you
heard
that
it
a
certain
lucas
were
you
asleep
the
crowd
laughed
while
the
abashed
rustic
muttered
a
few
words
and
moved
away
slowly
with
his
head
down
here
where
you
going
cried
the
old
man
after
him
that
not
the
way
out
that
the
way
to
the
dead
man
house
the
fellow
still
asleep
remarked
the
directorcillo
facetiously
better
pour
some
water
over
him
amid
the
laughter
of
the
bystanders
the
rustic
left
the
place
where
he
had
played
such
a
ridiculous
part
and
went
toward
the
church
in
the
sacristy
he
asked
for
the
senior
sacristan
he
still
asleep
was
the
rough
answer
do
you
know
that
the
convento
was
assaulted
last
night
then
i
wait
till
he
wakes
up
this
with
a
stupid
stare
at
the
sacristans
such
as
is
common
to
persons
who
are
used
to
rough
treatment
in
a
corner
which
was
still
in
shadow
the
senior
sacristan
lay
asleep
in
a
big
chair
his
spectacles
were
placed
on
his
forehead
amid
long
locks
of
hair
while
his
thin
squalid
chest
which
was
bare
rose
and
fell
regularly
the
rustic
took
a
seat
near
by
as
if
to
wait
patiently
but
he
dropped
a
piece
of
money
and
started
to
look
for
it
with
the
aid
of
a
candle
under
the
senior
sacristan
chair
he
noticed
seeds
of
on
the
pantaloons
and
on
the
cuffs
of
the
sleeper
camisa
the
latter
awoke
rubbed
his
one
good
eye
and
began
to
scold
the
rustic
with
great
i
wanted
to
order
a
mass
sir
was
the
reply
in
a
tone
of
excuse
the
masses
are
already
over
said
the
sacristan
sweetening
his
tone
a
little
at
this
if
you
want
it
for
tomorrow
is
it
for
the
souls
in
purgatory
no
sir
answered
the
rustic
handing
him
a
peso
then
gazing
fixedly
at
the
single
eye
he
added
it
for
a
person
who
going
to
die
soon
hereupon
he
left
the
sacristy
i
could
have
caught
him
last
night
he
sighed
as
he
took
off
the
bandage
and
stood
erect
to
recover
the
face
and
form

in

with
their
the

urchins

rose
on

or
climbed
up
on

the

that
agreeable
aspect
it
wore
when
the
program
of
the
fiesta
was
under
discussion
now
it
was
gloomy
and
rather
ominous
the
and
cuadrilleros
who
occupied
it
scarcely
spoke
and
then
with
few
words
in
low
tones
at
the
table
the
directorcillo
two
clerks
and
several
soldiers
were
rustling
papers
while
the
alferez
strode
from
one
side
to
the
other
at
times
gazing
fiercely
toward
the
door
prouder

after

doña

yawned
in
a
corner
exhibiting
a
dirty
mouth
and
jagged
teeth
while
she
fixed
her
cold
sinister
gaze
on
the
door
of
the
jail
which
was
covered
with
indecent
drawings
she
had
succeeded
in
persuading
her
husband
whose
victory
had
made
him
amiable
to
let
her
witness
the
inquiry
and
perhaps
the
accompanying
tortures
the
hyena
smelt
the
carrion
and
licked
herself
wearied
by
the
delay
the
gobernadorcillo
was
very
compunctious
his
seat
that
large
chair
placed
under
his
majesty
portrait
was
vacant
being
apparently
intended
for
some
one
else
about
nine
the
curate
arrived
pale
and
scowling
well
you
have
kept
yourself
waiting
the
alferez
greeted
him
i
should
prefer
not
to
be
present
replied
padre
salvi
in
a
low
voice
paying
no
heed
to
the
bitter
tone
of
the
alferez
i
very
nervous
as
no
one
else
has
come
to
fill
the
place
i
judged
that
your
presence
you
know
that
they
leave
this
afternoon
young
ibarra
and
the
the
alferez
pointed
toward
the
jail
there
are
eight
there
he
said
bruno
died
at
midnight
but
his
statement
is
on
record
the
curate
saluted
doña
consolacion
who
responded
with
a
yawn
and
took
his
seat
in
the
big
chair
under
his
majesty
portrait
let
us
begin
he
announced
bring
out
those
two
who
are
in
the
stocks
ordered
the
alferez
in
a
tone
that
he
tried
to
make
as
terrible
as
possible
then
turning
to
the
curate
he
added
with
a
change
of
tone
they
are
fastened
in
by
skipping
two
holes
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
not
informed
about
these
instruments
of
torture
we
will
say
that
the
stocks
are
one
of
the
most
harmless
the
holes
in
which
the
offender
legs
are
placed
are
a
little
more
or
less
than
a
foot
apart
by
skipping
two
holes
the
prisoner
finds
himself
in
a
rather
forced
position
with
peculiar
inconvenience
to
his
ankles
and
a
distance
of
about
a
yard
between
his
lower
extremities
it
does
not
kill
instantaneously
as
may
well
be
imagined
the
jailer
followed
by
four
soldiers
pushed
back
the
bolt
and
opened
the
door
a
nauseating
odor
and
currents
of
thick
damp
air
escaped
from
the
darkness
within
at
the
same
time
that
laments
and
sighs
were
heard
a
soldier
struck
a
match
but
the
flame
was
choked
in
such
a
foul
atmosphere
and
they
had
to
wait
until
the
air
became
fresher
in
the
dim
light
of
the
candle
several
human
forms
became
vaguely
outlined
men
hugging
their
knees
or
hiding
their
heads
between
them
some
lying
face
downward
some
standing
and
some
turned
toward
the
wall
a
blow
and
a
creak
were
heard
accompanied
by
curses
the
stocks
were
opened
doña
consolacion
bent
forward
with
the
muscles
of
her
neck
swelling
and
her
bulging
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
a
wretched
figure
tarsilo
bruno
brother
came
out
between
two
soldiers
on
his
wrists
were
handcuffs
and
his
clothing
was
in
shreds
revealing
quite
a
muscular
body
he
turned
his
eyes
insolently
on
the
alferez
woman
this
is
the
one
who
defended
himself
with
the
most
courage
and
told
his
companions
to
run
said
the
alferez
to
padre
salvi
behind
him
came
another
of
miserable
aspect
moaning
and
weeping
like
a
child
he
limped
along
exposing
pantaloons
spotted
with
blood
mercy
sir
mercy
i
not
go
back
into
the
yard
he
whimpered
he
a
rogue
observed
the
alferez
to
the
curate
he
tried
to
run
but
he
was
wounded
in
the
thigh
these
are
the
only
two
that
we
took
alive
what
your

asked

beat
our
father
to
death
and
we
were
avenging
him
nothing
more
look
for
your
two
associates
the
alferez
gazed
at
the
sergeant
in
surprise
they
over
there
in
the
gully
where
we
threw
them
yesterday
and
where
they
rot
now
kill
me
you
not
learn
anything
more
general
surprise
and
silence
broken
by
the
alferez
you
are
going
to
tell
who
your
other
accomplices
are
he
threatened
flourishing
a
rattan
whip
a
smile
of
disdain
curled
the
prisoner
lips
the
alferez
consulted
with
the
curate
in
a
low
tone
for
a
few
moments
then
turned
to
the
soldiers
take
him
out
where
the
corpses
are
he
commanded
on
a
cart
in
a
corner
of
the
yard
were
heaped
five
corpses
partly
covered
with
a
filthy
piece
of
torn
matting
a
soldier
walked
about
near
them
spitting
at
every
moment
do
you
know
them
asked
the
alferez
lifting
up
the
matting
tarsilo
did
not
answer
he
saw
the
corpse
of
the
madwoman
husband
with
two
others
that
of
his
brother
slashed
with
and
that
of
lucas
with
the
halter
still
around
his
neck
his
look
became
somber
and
a
sigh
seemed
to
escape
from
his
breast
do
you
know
them
he
was
again
asked
but
he
still
remained
silent
the
air
hissed
and
the
rattan
cut
his
shoulders
he
shuddered
his
muscles
contracted
the
blows
were
redoubled
but
he
remained
unmoved
whip
him
until
he
bursts
or
talks
cried
the
exasperated
alferez
talk
now
the
directorcillo
advised
him
they
kill
you
anyhow
they
led
him
back
into
the
hall
where
the
other
prisoner
with
chattering
teeth
and
quaking
limbs
was
calling
upon
the
saints
do
you
know
this
fellow
asked
padre
salvi
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
ever
seen
him
replied
tarsilo
with
a
look
of
pity
at
the
other
the
alferez
struck
him
with
his
fist
and
kicked
him
tie
him
to
the
bench
without
taking
off
the
handcuffs
which
were
covered
with
blood
they
tied
him
to
a
wooden
bench
the
wretched
boy
looked
about
him
as
if
seeking
something
and
noticed
doña
consolacion
at
sight
of
whom
he
smiled
sardonically
in
surprise
the
bystanders
followed
his
glance
and
saw
the
señora
who
was
lightly
gnawing
at
her
lips
i
never
seen
an
uglier
woman
exclaimed
tarsilo
in
the
midst
of
a
general
silence
i
rather
lie
down
on
a
bench
as
i
do
now
than
at
her
side
as
the
alferez
does
the
muse
turned
pale
you
going
to
flog
me
to
death
señor
alferez
he
went
on
but
tonight
your
woman
will
revenge
me
by
embracing
you
gag
him
yelled
the
furious
alferez
trembling
with
wrath
tarsilo
seemed
to
have
desired
the
gag
for
after
it
was
put
in
place
his
eyes
gleamed
with
satisfaction
at
a
signal
from
the
alferez
a
guard
armed
with
a
rattan
whip
began
his
gruesome
task
whole
body
contracted
and
a
stifled
prolonged
cry
escaped
from
him
in
spite
of
the
piece
of
cloth
which
covered
his
mouth
his
head
drooped
and
his
clothes
became
stained
with
blood
padre
salvi
pallid
and
with
wandering
looks
arose
laboriously
made
a
sign
with
his
hand
and
left
the
hall
with
faltering
steps
in
the
street
he
saw
a
young
woman
leaning
with
her
shoulders
against
the
wall
rigid
motionless
listening
attentively
staring
into
space
her
clenched
hands
stretched
out
along
the
wall
the
sun
beat
down
upon
her
fiercely
she
seemed
to
be
breathlessly
counting
those
dry
dull
strokes
and
those
heartrending
groans
it
was
tarsilo
sister
meanwhile
the
scene
in
the
hall
continued
the
wretched
boy
overcome
with
pain
silently
waited
for
his
executioners
to
become
weary
at
last
the
panting
soldier
let
his
arm
fall
and
the
alferez
pale
with
anger
and
astonishment
made
a
sign
for
them
to
untie
him
doña
consolacion
then
arose
and
murmured
a
few
words
into
the
ear
of
her
husband
who
nodded
his
head
in
understanding
to
the
well
with
him
he
ordered
the
filipinos
know
what
this
means
in
tagalog
they
call
it
we
do
not
know
who
invented
this
procedure
but
we
judge
that
it
must
be
quite
ancient
truth
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
may
perhaps
be
a
sarcastic
interpretation
in
the
center
of
the
yard
rose
the
picturesque
curb
of
a
well
roughly
fashioned
from
living
rock
a
rude
apparatus
of
bamboo
in
the
form
of
a
served
for
drawing
up
the
thick
slimy
water
broken
pieces
of
pottery
manure
and
other
refuse
were
collected
there
since
this
well
was
like
the
jail
being
the
place
for
what
society
rejected
or
found
useless
and
any
object
that
fell
into
it
however
good
it
might
have
been
was
then
a
thing
lost
yet
it
was
never
closed
up
and
even
at
times
the
prisoners
were
condemned
to
go
down
and
deepen
it
not
because
there
was
any
thought
of
getting
anything
useful
out
of
such
punishment
but
because
of
the
difficulties
the
work
offered
a
prisoner
who
once
went
down
there
would
contract
a
fever
from
which
he
would
surely
die
tarsilo
gazed
upon
all
the
preparations
of
the
soldiers
with
a
fixed
look
he
was
pale
and
his
lips
trembled
or
murmured
a
prayer
the
haughtiness
of
his
desperation
seemed
to
have
disappeared
or
at
least
to
have
weakened
several
times
he
bent
his
stiff
neck
and
fixed
his
gaze
on
the
ground
as
though
resigned
to
his
sufferings
they
led
him
to
the
followed
by
the
smiling
doña
consolacion
in
his
misery
he
cast
a
glance
of
envy
toward
the
heap
of
corpses
and
a
sigh
escaped
from
his
breast
talk
now
the
directorcillo
again
advised
him
they
hang
you
anyhow
you
at
least
die
without
suffering
so
much
you
come
out
of
this
only
to
die
added
a
cuadrillero
they
took
away
the
gag
and
hung
him
up
by
his
feet
for
he
must
go
down
head
foremost
and
remain
some
time
under
the
water
just
as
the
bucket
does
only
that
the
man
is
left
a
longer
time
while
the
alferez
was
gone
to
look
for
a
watch
to
count
the
minutes
tarsilo
hung
with
his
long
hair
streaming
down
and
his
eyes
half
closed
if
you
are
christians
if
you
have
any
heart
he
begged
in
a
low
voice
let
me
down
quickly
or
make
my
head
strike
against
the
sides
so
that
i
die
god
will
reward
you
for
this
good
deed
perhaps
some
day
you
may
be
as
i
am
the
alferez
returned
watch
in
hand
to
superintend
the
lowering
slowly
slowly
cried
doña
consolacion
as
she
kept
her
gaze
fixed
on
the
wretch
be
careful
the
moved
gently
downwards
tarsilo
rubbed
against
the
jutting
stones
and
filthy
weeds
that
grew
in
the
crevices
then
the
sweep
stopped
while
the
alferez
counted
the
seconds
lift
him
up
he
ordered
at
the
end
of
a
the
silvery
and
harmonious
tinkling
of
the
drops
of
water
falling
back
indicated
the
prisoner
return
to
the
light
now
that
the
sweep
was
heavier
he
rose
rapidly
pieces
of
stone
and
pebbles
torn
from
the
walls
fell
noisily
his
forehead
and
hair
smeared
with
filthy
slime
his
face
covered
with
cuts
and
bruises
his
body
wet
and
dripping
he
appeared
to
the
eyes
of
the
silent
crowd
the
wind
made
him
shiver
with
cold
will
you
talk
he
was
asked
take
care
of
my
sister
murmured
the
unhappy
boy
as
he
gazed
beseechingly
toward
one
of
the
cuadrilleros
the
bamboo
sweep
again
creaked
and
the
condemned
boy
once
more
disappeared
doña
consolacion
observed
that
the
water
remained
quiet
the
alferez
counted
a
minute
when
tarsilo
again
came
up
his
features
were
contracted
and
livid
with
his
bloodshot
eyes
wide
open
he
looked
at
the
bystanders
are
you
going
to
talk
the
alferez
again
demanded
in
dismay
tarsilo
shook
his
head
and
they
again
lowered
him
his
eyelids
were
closing
as
the
pupils
continued
to
stare
at
the
sky
where
the
fleecy
clouds
floated
he
doubled
back
his
neck
so
that
he
might
still
see
the
light
of
day
but
all
too
soon
he
had
to
go
down
into
the
water
and
that
foul
curtain
shut
out
the
sight
of
the
world
from
him
forever
a
minute
passed
the
watchful
muse
saw
large
bubbles
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
water
he
thirsty
she
commented
with
a
laugh
the
water
again
became
still
this
time
the
alferez
did
not
give
the
signal
for
a
minute
and
a
half
tarsilo
features
were
now
no
longer
contracted
the
lids
left
the
whites
of
his
eyes
showing
from
his
mouth
poured
muddy
water
streaked
with
blood
but
his
body
did
not
tremble
in
the
chill
breeze
pale
and
terrified
the
silent
bystanders
gazed
at
one
another
the
alferez
made
a
sign
that
they
should
take
the
body
down
and
then
moved
away
thoughtfully
doña
consolation
applied
the
lighted
end
of
her
cigar
to
the
bare
legs
but
the
flesh
did
not
twitch
and
the
fire
was
extinguished
he
strangled
himself
murmured
a
cuadrillero
look
how
he
turned
his
tongue
back
as
if
trying
to
swallow
it
the
other
prisoner
who
had
watched
this
scene
sweating
and
trembling
now
stared
like
a
lunatic
in
all
directions
the
alferez
ordered
the
directorcillo
to
question
him
sir
sir
he
groaned
i
tell
everything
you
want
me
to
good
let
see
what
your
name

ricardo
eduardo
gerardo
or
what

repeated
the
imbecile
put
it
down
bernardo
or
whatever
it
may
be
dictated
the
alferez
surname
the
man
gazed
at
him
in
terror
what
name
have
you
that
is
added
to
the
name
andong
ah
sir
andong
the
witless
sir
the
bystander
could
not
restrain
a
smile
even
the
alferez
paused
in
his
pacing
about
occupation
pruner
of
coconut
trees
sir
and
servant
of
my
who
ordered
you
to
attack
the
barracks
no
one
sir
what

or
into
the
well

asking

in
the
yard
by
the
barracks
last
night
ah
sir
exclaimed
andong
blushing
who
guilty
of
that
my
sir
surprise
and
laughter
followed
these
words
the
alferez
stopped
and
stared
not
unkindly
at
the
wretch
who
thinking
that
his
words
had
produced
a
good
effect
went
on
with
more
spirit
yes
sir
my
does
give
me
anything
to
eat
but
what
is
rotten
and
unfit
so
last
night
when
i
came
by
here
with
my
belly
aching
i
saw
the
yard
of
the
barracks
near
and
i
said
to
myself
no
one
will
see
me
i
went
in
and
then
many
shots
sounded
a
blow
from
the
rattan
cut
his
speech
short
to
the
jail
ordered
the
alferez
this
afternoon
to
the
capital
chapter
lviii
the
accursed
soon
the
news
spread
through
the
town
that
the
prisoners
were
about
to
set
out
at
first
it
was
heard
with
terror
afterward
came
the
weeping
and
wailing
the
families
of
the
prisoners
ran
about
in
distraction
going
from
the
convento
to
the
barracks
from
the
barracks
to
the
town
hall
and
finding
no
consolation
anywhere
filled
the
air
with
cries
and
groans
the
curate
had
shut
himself
up
on
a
plea
of
illness
the
alferez
had
increased
the
guards
who
received
the
supplicating
women
with
the
butts
of
their
rifles
the
gobernadorcillo
at
best
a
useless
creature
seemed
to
be
more
foolish
and
more
useless
than
ever
in
front
of
the
jail
the
women
who
still
had
strength
enough
ran
to
and
fro
while
those
who
had
not
sat
down
on
the
ground
and
called
upon
the
names
of
their
beloved
although
the
sun
beat
down
fiercely
not
one
of
these
unfortunates
thought
of
going
away
doray
the
erstwhile
merry
and
happy
wife
of
don
filipo
wandered
about
dejectedly
carrying
in
her
arms
their
infant
son
both
weeping
to
the
advice
of
friends
that
she
go
back
home
to
avoid
exposing
her
baby
to
an
attack
of
fever
the
disconsolate
woman
replied
why
should
he
live
if
he
is
going
to
have
a
father
to
rear
him
your
husband
is
innocent
perhaps
he
come
back
yes
after
we
all
dead
capitana
tinay
wept
and
called
upon
her
son
antonio
the
courageous
capitana
maria
gazed
silently
toward
the
small
grating
behind
which
were
her
her
only
sons
there
was
present
also
the
of
the
pruner
of
but
she
was
not
weeping
instead
she
paced
back
and
forth
gesticulating
with
uplifted
arms
and
haranguing
the
crowd
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
it
to
arrest
my
andong
to
shoot
at
him
to
put
him
in
the
stocks
to
take
him
to
the
capital
and
only
because
because
he
had
a
new
pair
of
pantaloons
this
calls
for
vengeance
the
are
committing
abuses
i
swear
that
if
i
ever
again
catch
one
of
them
in
my
garden
as
has
often
happened
i
chop
him
up
i
chop
him
up
or
else
let
him
try
to
chop
me
up
few
persons
however
joined
in
the
protests
of
the
mussulmanish
don
crisostomo
is
to
blame
for
all
this
sighed
a
woman
the
schoolmaster
was
also
in
the
crowd
wandering
about
bewildered
ñor
juan
did
not
rub
his
hands
nor
was
he
carrying
his
rule
and
he
was
dressed
in
black
for
he
had
heard
the
bad
news
and
true
to
his
habit
of
looking
upon
the
future
as
already
assured
was
in
mourning
for
ibarra
death
at
two
in
the
afternoon
an
open
cart
drawn
by
two
oxen
stopped
in
front
of
the
town
hall
this
was
at
once
set
upon
by
the
people
who
attempted
to
unhitch
the
oxen
and
destroy
it
do
do
that
said
capitana
maria
do
you
want
to
make
them
walk
this
consideration
acted
as
a
restraint
on
the
prisoners
relatives
twenty
soldiers
came
out
and
surrounded
the
cart
then
the
prisoners
appeared
the
first
was
don
filipo
bound
he
greeted
his
wife
smilingly
but
doray
broke
out
into
bitter
weeping
and
two
guards
had
difficulty
in
preventing
her
from
embracing
her
husband
antonio
the
son
of
capitana
tinay
appeared
crying
like
a
baby
which
only
added
to
the
lamentations
of
his
family
the
witless
andong
broke
out
into
tears
at
sight
of
his
the
cause
of
his
misfortune
albino
the
quondam
theological
student
was
also
bound
as
were
capitana
maria
twins
all
three
were
grave
and
serious
the
last
to
come
out
was
ibarra
unbound
but
conducted
between
two
guards
the
pallid
youth
looked
about
him
for
a
friendly
face
he
the
one
that
to
blame
cried
many
voices
he
to
blame
and
he
goes
loose
my
has
done
anything
and
he
got
handcuffs
on
ibarra
turned
to
the
guards
bind
me
and
bind
me
well
elbow
to
elbow
he
said
we
have
any
order
bind
me
and
the
soldiers
obeyed
the
alferez
appeared
on
horseback
armed
to
the
teeth
ten
or
fifteen
more
soldiers
following
him
each
prisoner
had
his
family
there
to
pray
for
him
to
weep
for
him
to
bestow
on
him
the
most
endearing
names
all
save
ibarra
who
had
no
one
even
ñor
juan
and
the
schoolmaster
having
disappeared
look
what
you
done
to
my
husband
and
my
son
doray
cried
to
him
look
at
my
poor
son
you
robbed
him
of
his
father
so
the
sorrow
of
the
families
was
converted
into
anger
toward
the
young
man
who
was
accused
of
having
started
the
trouble
the
alferez
gave
the
order
to
set
out
you
a
coward
the
of
andong
cried
after
ibarra
while
others
were
fighting
for
you
you
hid
yourself
coward
may
you
be
accursed
exclaimed
an
old
man
running
along
beside
him
accursed
be
the
gold
amassed
by
your
family
to
disturb
our
peace
accursed
accursed
may
they
hang
you
heretic
cried
a
relative
of
albino
unable
to
restrain
himself
he
caught
up
a
stone
and
threw
it
at
the
youth
this
example
was
quickly
followed
and
a
rain
of
dirt
and
stones
fell
on
the
wretched
young
man
without
anger
or
complaint
impassively
he
bore
the
righteous
vengeance
of
so
many
suffering
hearts
this
was
the
parting
the
farewell
offered
to
him
by
the
people
among
whom
were
all
his
affections
with
bowed
head
he
was
perhaps
thinking
of
a
man
whipped
through
the
streets
of
manila
of
an
old
woman
falling
dead
at
the
sight
of
her
son
head
perhaps
elias
history
was
passing
before
his
eyes
the
alferez
found
it
necessary
to
drive
the
crowd
back
but
the
and
the
insults
did
not
cease
one
mother
alone
did
not
wreak
vengeance
on
him
for
her
sorrows
capitana
maria
motionless
with
lips
contracted
and
eyes
full
of
silent
tears
she
saw
her
two
sons
move
away
her
firmness
her
dumb
grief
surpassed
that
of
the
fabled
niobe
so
the
procession
moved
on
of
the
persons
who
appeared
at
the
few
open
windows
those
who
showed
most
pity
for
the
youth
were
the
indifferent
and
the
curious
all
his
friends
had
hidden
themselves
even
capitan
basilio
himself
who
forbade
his
daughter
sinang
to
weep
ibarra
saw
the
smoking
ruins
of
his
house
the
home
of
his
fathers
where
he
was
born
where
clustered
the
fondest
recollections
of
his
childhood
and
his
youth
tears
long
repressed
started
into
his
eyes
and
he
bowed
his
head
and
wept
without
having
the
consolation
of
being
able
to
hide
his
grief
tied
as
he
was
nor
of
having
any
one
in
whom
his
sorrow
awoke
compassion
now
he
had
neither
country
nor
home
nor
love
nor
friends
nor
future
from
a
slight
elevation
a
man
gazed
upon
the
sad
procession
he
was
an
old
man
pale
and
emaciated
wrapped
in
a
woolen
blanket
supporting
himself
with
difficulty
on
a
staff
it
was
the
old
sage
tasio
who
on
hearing
of
the
event
had
left
his
bed
to
be
present
but
his
strength
had
not
been
sufficient
to
carry
him
to
the
town
hall
the
old
man
followed
the
cart
with
his
gaze
until
it
disappeared
in
the
distance
and
then
remained
for
some
time
afterward
with
his
head
bowed
deep
in
thought
then
he
stood
up
and
laboriously
made
his
way
toward
his
house
pausing
to
rest
at
every
step
on
the
following
day
some
herdsmen
found
him
dead
on
the
very
threshold
of
his
solitary
home
chapter
lix
patriotism
and
private
interests
secretly
the
telegraph
transmitted
the
report
to
manila
and
hours
later
the
newspapers
commented
on
it
with
great
mystery
and
not
a
few
dark
hints
augmented
corrected
or
mutilated
by
the
censor
in
the
meantime
private
reports
emanating
from
the
convents
were
the
first
to
gain
secret
currency
from
mouth
to
mouth
to
the
great
terror
of
those
who
heard
them
the
fact
distorted
in
a
thousand
ways
was
believed
with
greater
or
less
ease
according
to
whether
it
was
flattering
or
worked
contrary
to
the
passions
and
ways
of
thinking
of
each
hearer
without
public
tranquillity
seeming
disturbed
at
least
outwardly
yet
the
peace
of
mind
of
each
home
was
whirled
about
like
the
water
in
a
pond
while
the
surface
appears
smooth
and
clear
in
the
depths
the
silent
fishes
swarm
dive
about
and
chase
one
another
for
one
part
of
the
population
crosses
decorations
epaulets
offices
prestige
power
importance
dignities
began
to
whirl
about
like
butterflies
in
a
golden
atmosphere
for
the
other
part
a
dark
cloud
arose
on
the
horizon
projecting
from
its
gray
depths
like
black
silhouettes
bars
chains
and
even
the
fateful
gibbet
in
the
air
there
seemed
to
be
heard
investigations
condemnations
and
the
cries
from
the
torture
chamber
marianas
and
bagumbayan
presented
themselves
wrapped
in
a
torn
and
bloody
veil
fishers
and
fished
confused
fate
pictured
the
event
to
the
imaginations
of
the
manilans
like
certain
chinese
fans
one
side
painted
black
the
other
gilded
with
birds
and
flowers
in
the
convents
the
greatest
excitement
prevailed
carriages
were
harnessed
the
provincials
exchanged
visits
and
held
secret
conferences
they
presented
themselves
in
the
palaces
to
offer
their
aid
to
government
in
its
perilous
again
there
was
talk
of
comets
and
omens
te
deum
a
te
deum
cried
a
friar
in
one
convent
this
time
let
no
one
be
absent
from
the
chorus
it
no
small
mercy
from
god
to
make
it
clear
just
now
especially
in
these
hopeless
times
how
much
we
are
worth
the
little
general
can
gnaw
his
lips
over
this
lesson
responded
another
what
would
have
become
of
him
if
not
for
the
religious
corporations
and
to
celebrate
the
fiesta
better
serve
notice
on
the
cook
and
the
refectioner
for
three
days
amen
viva
salvi
amen
in
another
convent
they
talked
differently
you
see
now
that
fellow
is
a
pupil
of
the
jesuits
the
filibusters
come
from
the
ateneo
and
the
i
told
you
so
the
jesuits
are
ruining
the
country
they
corrupting
the
youth
but
they
are
tolerated
because
they
trace
a
few
scrawls
on
a
piece
of
paper
when
there
is
an
earthquake
and
god
knows
how
they
are
made
yes
but
do
contradict
them
when
everything
is
shaking
and
moving
about
who
draws
diagrams
nothing
padre
secchi
and
they
smiled
with
sovereign
disdain
but
what
about
the
weather
forecasts
and
the
typhoons
asked
another
ironically
are
they
divine
any
fisherman
foretells
them
when
he
who
governs
is
a
fool
tell
me
how
your
head
is
and
tell
you
how
your
foot
is
but
you
see
if
the
friends
favor
one
another
the
newspapers
very
nearly
ask
a
miter
for
padre
salvi
he
going
to
get
it
he
lick
it
right
up
do
you
think
so
why
not
nowadays
they
grant
one
for
anything
whatsoever
i
know
of
a
fellow
who
got
one
for
less
he
wrote
a
cheap
little
work
demonstrating
that
the
indians
are
not
capable
of
being
anything
but
mechanics
pshaw
that
right
so
much
favoritism
injures
religion
exclaimed
another
if
the
miters
only
had
eyes
and
could
see
what
heads
they
were
upon
if
the
miters
were
natural
objects
added
another
in
a
nasal
tone
abhorrer
that
why
they
grab
for
them
their
emptiness
attracts
responded
another
these
and
many
more
things
were
said
in
the
convents
but
we
will
spare
our
reader
other
comments
of
a
political
metaphysical
or
piquant
nature
and
conduct
him
to
a
private
house
as
we
have
few
acquaintances
in
manila
let
us
enter
the
home
of
capitan
tinong
the
polite
individual
whom
we
saw
so
profusely
inviting
ibarra
to
honor
him
with
a
visit
in
the
rich
and
spacious
sala
of
his
tondo
house
capitan
tinong
was
seated
in
a
wide
armchair
rubbing
his
hands
in
a
gesture
of
despair
over
his
face
and
the
nape
of
his
neck
while
his
wife
capitana
tinchang
was
weeping
and
preaching
to
him
from
the
corner
their
two
daughters
listened
silently
and
stupidly
yet
greatly
affected
ay
virgin
of
antipolo
cried
the
woman
ay
virgin
of
the
rosary
and
of
the
girdle
ay
ay
our
lady
of
novaliches
mother
responded
the
elder
of
the
daughters
i
told
you
so
continued
the
wife
in
an
accusing
tone
i
told
you
so
ay
virgin
of
carmen
ay
but
you
did
tell
me
anything
capitan
tinong
dared
to
answer
tearfully
on
the
contrary
you
told
me
that
i
was
doing
well
to
frequent
capitan
tiago
house
and
cultivate
friendship
with
him
because
he
rich
and
you
told
me
what
what
did
i
tell
you
i
did
tell
you
that
i
did
tell
you
anything
ay
if
you
had
only
listened
to
me
now
you
throwing
the
blame
on
he
replied
bitterly
slapping
the
arm
of
his
chair
did
you
tell
me
that
i
had
done
well
to
invite
him
to
dine
with
us
because
he
was
wealthy
did
you
say
that
we
ought
to
have
friends
only
among
the
wealthy
it
true
that
i
told
you
so
because
because
there
was
anything
else
for
me
to
do
you
did
nothing
but
sing
his
praises
here
there
everywhere
but
i
did
advise
you
to
hunt
him
up
and
talk
to
him
at
that
reception
you
ca
deny
that
did
i
know
that
he
was
to
be
there
perhaps
but
you
ought
to
have
known
it
how
so
if
i
did
even
know
him
but
you
ought
to
have
known
him
but
tinchang
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
ever
saw
him
that
i
ever
heard
him
spoken
of
well
then
you
ought
to
have
known
him
before
and
heard
him
spoken
of
that
what
you
a
man
for
and
wear
trousers
and
read
diario
de
answered
his
unterrified
spouse
casting
on
him
a
terrible
look
to
this
capitan
tinong
did
not
know
what
to
reply
capitana
tinchang
however
was
not
satisfied
with
this
victory
but
wished
to
silence
him
completely
so
she
approached
him
with
clenched
fists
is
this
what
i
worked
for
year
after
year
toiling
and
saving
that
you
by
your
stupidity
may
throw
away
the
fruits
of
my
labor
she
scolded
now
they
come
to
deport
you
they
take
away
all
our
property
just
as
they
did
from
the
wife
of
oh
if
i
were
a
man
if
i
were
a
man
seeing
that
her
husband
bowed
his
head
she
again
fell
to
sobbing
but
still
repeating
ay
if
i
were
a
man
if
i
were
a
man
well
if
you
were
a
man
the
provoked
husband
at
length
asked
what
would
you
do
what
would
i
do
well
well
well
this
very
minute
i
go
to
the
and
offer
to
fight
against
the
rebels
this
very
minute
but
have
you
seen
what
the
says
read
it
vile
and
infamous
treason
has
been
suppressed
with
energy
strength
and
vigor
and
soon
the
rebellious
enemies
of
the
fatherland
and
their
accomplices
will
feel
all
the
weight
and
severity
of
the
law
you
see
it
there
is
any
more
rebellion
that
does
matter
you
ought
to
offer
yourself
as
they
did
in
they
saved
themselves
yes
that
what
was
done
by
padre
burg
but
he
was
unable
to
finish
this
name
for
his
wife
ran
to
him
and
slapped
her
hand
over
his
mouth
shut
up
are
you
saying
that
name
so
that
they
may
garrote
you
tomorrow
on
bagumbayan
do
you
know
that
to
pronounce
it
is
enough
to
get
yourself
condemned
without
trial
keep
quiet
however
capitan
tinong
may
have
felt
about
obeying
her
he
could
hardly
have
done
otherwise
for
she
had
his
mouth
covered
with
both
her
hands
pressing
his
little
head
against
the
back
of
the
chair
so
that
the
poor
fellow
might
have
been
smothered
to
death
had
not
a
new
personage
appeared
on
the
scene
this
was
their
cousin
don
primitivo
who
had
memorized
the
amat
a
man
of
some
forty
years
plump
and
elegantly
dressed
video
he
exclaimed
as
he
entered
happening
ay
cousin
cried
the
woman
running
toward
him
in
tears
sent
for
you
because
i
do
know
what
going
to
become
of
us
what
do
you
advise
speak
you
studied
latin
and
know
how
to
argue
but
first
quaeritis
nihil
est
in
intellectu
quod
prius
non
fuerit
in
sensu
nihil
volitum
quin
he
sat
down
gravely
and
just
as
if
the
latin
phrases
had
possessed
a
soothing
virtue
the
couple
ceased
weeping
and
drew
nearer
to
him
to
hang
upon
the
advice
from
his
lips
as
at
one
time
the
greeks
did
before
the
words
of
salvation
from
the
oracle
that
was
to
free
them
from
the
persian
invaders
why
do
you
weep
gentium
sumus
you
already
heard
of
the
uprising
ibarrae
ab
alferesio
guardiae
civilis
destructum
et
nunc
what
does
don
crisostomo
owe
you
anything
no
but
you
know
tinong
invited
him
to
dinner
and
spoke
to
him
on
the
bridge
of
spain
in
broad
daylight
they
say
that
he
a
friend
of
his
a
friend
of
his
exclaimed
the
startled
latinist
rising

ahem
capitan
tinong
turned
deathly
pale
at
hearing
so
many
words
in
such
a
sound
presaged
his
wife
clasped
her
hands
supplicatingly
and
said
cousin
do
talk
to
us
in
latin
now
you
know
that
we
not
philosophers
like
you
let
talk
in
spanish
or
tagalog
give
us
some
advice
it
a
pity
that
you
do
understand
latin
cousin
truths
in
latin
are
lies
in
tagalog
for
example
principia
negantem
fustibus

in
latin
is
a
truth
like
noah
ark
but
i
put
it
into
practise
once
and
i
was
the
one
who
got
whipped
so
it
a
pity
that
you
do
know
latin
in
latin
everything
would
be
straightened
out
we
too
know
many
and
dei
but
now
we
should
understand
one
another
provide
tinong
with
an
argument
so
that
they
wo
hang
him
you
done
wrong
very
wrong
cousin
in
cultivating
friendship
with
that
young
man
replied
the
latinist
the
righteous
suffer
for

to

dismay

orders
and
more
orders

soon
a
big
fire
was
burning
in
the
kitchen
old
shotguns

smashed
with
axes
rusty
revolvers

thrown
away
the

four
or
five
hours
later
at
a
pretentious
reception
in
the
walled

current

were
being
commented
upon
there
were

a

employees
dressed
in
loose
gowns
fanning
themselves
and
yawning
among
the
men
who
like
the
women
showed
in
their
faces
their
education
and
origin
was
an
elderly
gentleman
small
and
whom
the
others
treated
with
great
respect
he
himself
maintained
a
disdainful
silence
to
tell
the
truth
formerly
i
could
endure
the
friars
and
the
they
so
rude
said
a
corpulent
dame
but
now
that
i
see
their
usefulness
and
their
services
i
would
almost
marry
any
one
of
them
gladly
i
a
patriot
that
what
i
say
added
a
thin
lady
what
a
pity
that
we
our
former
governor
he
would
leave
the
country
as
clean
as
a
platter
and
the
whole
race
of
filibusters
would
be
exterminated
do
they
say
that
there
are
still
a
lot
of
islands
to
be
populated
why
do
they
deport
all
these
crazy
indians
to
them
if
i
were
the
señoras
interrupted
the
individual
the
knows
his
duty
as
i
heard
he
very
much
irritated
for
he
had
heaped
favors
on
that
ibarra
heaped
favors
on
him
echoed
the
thin
lady
fanning
herself
furiously
look
how
ungrateful
these
indians
are
is
it
possible
to
treat
them
as
if
they
were
human
beings
do
you
know
what
i
heard
asked
a
military
official
what
that
let
hear
it
what
do
they
say
reputable
persons
replied
the
officer
in
the
midst
of
a
profound
silence
state
that
this
agitation
for
building
a
schoolhouse
was
a
pure
fairy
tale
just
see
that
the
señoras
exclaimed
already
believing
in
the
trick
the
school
was
a
pretext
what
he
wanted
to
build
was
a
fort
from
which
he
could
safely
defend
himself
when
we
should
come
to
attack
him
what
infamy
only
an
indian
is
capable
of
such
cowardly
thoughts
exclaimed
the
fat
lady
if
i
were
the
they
would
soon
seem
they
would
soon
see
that
what
i
say
exclaimed
the
thin
lady
turning
to
the
man
arrest
all
the
little
lawyers
priestlings
merchants
and
without
trial
banish
or
deport
them
tear
out
the
evil
by
the
roots
but
it
said
that
this
filibuster
is
the
descendant
of
spaniards
observed
the
man
without
looking
at
any
one
in
particular
oh
yes
exclaimed
the
fat
lady
unterrified
it
always
the
creoles
no
indian
knows
anything
about
revolution
rear
crows
rear
crows
do
you
know
what
i
heard
asked
a
creole
lady
to
change
the
topic
of
conversation
the
wife
of
capitan
tinong
you
remember
her
the
woman
in
whose
house
we
danced
and
dined
during
the
fiesta
of
tondo
the
one
who
has
two
daughters
what
about
her
well
that
woman
just
this
afternoon
presented
the
with
a
ring
worth
a
thousand
pesos
the
man
turned
around
is
that
so
why
he
asked
with
shining
eyes
she
said
that
it
was
a
christmas
gift
but
christmas
does
come
for
a
month
yet
perhaps
she
afraid
the
storm
is
blowing
her
way
observed
the
fat
lady
and
is
getting
under
cover
added
the
thin
señora
when
no
return
is
asked
it
a
confession
of
guilt
this
must
be
carefully
looked
into
declared
the
man
thoughtfully
i
fear
that
there
a
cat
in
the
bag
a
cat
in
the
bag
yes
that
just
what
i
was
going
to
say
echoed
the
thin
lady
and
so
was
i
said
the
other
taking
the
words
out
of
her
mouth
the
wife
of
capitan
tinong
is
so
stingy
she
has
yet
sent
us
any
present
and
that
after
we
been
in
her
house
so
when
such
a
grasping
and
covetous
woman
lets
go
of
a
little
present
worth
a
thousand
pesos
but
is
it
a
fact
inquired
the
man
certainly
most
certainly
my
cousin
sweetheart
his
adjutant
told
her
so
and
i
of
the
opinion
that
it
the
very
same
ring
that
the
older
daughter
wore
on
the
day
of
the
fiesta
always
covered
with
diamonds
a
walking
a
way
of
attracting
attention
like
any
other
instead
of
buying
a
fashion
plate
or
paying
a
dressmaker
giving
some
pretext
the
man
left
the
gathering
two
hours
later
when
the
world
slept
various
residents
of
tondo
received
an
invitation
through
some
soldiers
the
authorities
could
not
consent
to
having
certain
persons
of
position
and
property
sleep
in
such
poorly
guarded
and
badly
ventilated
houses
in
fort
santiago
and
other
government
buildings
their
sleep
would
be
calmer
and
more
refreshing
among
these
favored
persons
was
included
the
unfortunate
capitan
tinong
chapter
lx
maria
clara
weds
capitan
tiago
was
very
happy
for
in
all
this
terrible
storm
no
one
had
taken
any
notice
of
him
he
had
not
been
arrested
nor
had
he
been
subjected
to
solitary
confinement
investigations
electric
machines
continuous
in
underground
cells
or
other
pleasantries
that
are
to
certain
folk
who
call
themselves
civilized
his
friends
that
is
those
who
had
been
his
friends
for
the
good
man
had
denied
all
his
filipino
friends
from
the
instant
when
they
were
suspected
by
the
government
had
also
returned
to
their
homes
after
a
few
days
vacation
in
the
state
edifices
the
himself
had
ordered
that
they
be
cast
out
from
his
precincts
not
considering
them
worthy
of
remaining
therein
to
the
great
disgust
of
the
individual
who
had
hoped
to
celebrate
the
approaching
christmas
in
their
abundant
and
opulent
company
capitan
tinong
had
returned
to
his
home
sick
pale
and
swollen
the
excursion
had
not
done
him
good
he
was
so
changed
that
he
said
not
a
word
nor
even
greeted
his
family
who
wept
laughed
chattered
and
almost
went
mad
with
joy
the
poor
man
no
longer
ventured
out
of
his
house
for
fear
of
running
the
risk
of
saying
to
a
filibuster
not
even
don
primitivo
himself
with
all
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
could
draw
him
out
of
his
silence
the
latinist
told
him
if
i
had
got
here
to
burn
all
your
papers
they
would
have
squeezed
your
neck
and
if
i
had
burned
the
whole
house
they
would
have
touched
a
hair
of
your
head
but
eventum
gratias
agamus

quia

camotes
stories
similar
to
capitan
tinong
were
not
unknown
to
capitan
tiago
so
he
bubbled
over
with
gratitude
without
knowing
exactly
to
whom
he
owed
such
signal
favors
aunt
isabel
attributed
the
miracle
to
the
virgin
of
antipolo
to
the
virgin
of
the
rosary
or
at
least
to
the
virgin
of
carmen
and
at
the
very
very
least
that
she
was
willing
to
concede
to
our
lady
of
the
girdle
according
to
her
the
miracle
could
not
get
beyond
that
capitan
tiago
did
not
deny
the
miracle
but
added
i
think
so
isabel
but
the
virgin
of
antipolo
could
have
done
it
alone
my
friends
have
helped
my
future
señor
linares
who
as
you
know
joked
with
señor
antonio
canovas
himself
the
premier
whose
portrait
appears
in
the
he
who
does
condescend
to
show
more
than
half
his
face
to
the
people
so
the
good
man
could
not
repress
a
smile
of
satisfaction
every
time
that
he
heard
any
important
news
and
there
was
plenty
of
news
it
was
whispered
about
in
secret
that
ibarra
would
be
hanged
that
while
many
proofs
of
his
guilt
had
been
lacking
at
last
some
one
had
appeared
to
sustain
the
accusation
that
experts
had
declared
that
in
fact
the
work
on
the
schoolhouse
could
pass
for
a
bulwark
of
fortification
although
somewhat
defective
as
was
only
to
be
expected
of
ignorant
indians
these
rumors
calmed
him
and
made
him
smile
in
the
same
way
that
capitan
tiago
and
his
cousin
diverged
in
their
opinions
the
friends
of
the
family
were
also
divided
into
two
parties
one
miraculous
the
other
governmental
although
this
latter
was
insignificant
the
miraculous
party
was
again
subdivided
the
senior
sacristan
of
binondo
the
and
the
leader
of
the
brotherhood
saw
the
hand
of
god
directed
by
the
virgin
of
the
rosary
while
the
chinese
his
caterer
on
his
visits
to
antipolo
said
as
he
fanned
himself
and
shook
his
leg
do
fool
yourself
it
the
virgin
of
antipolo
she
can
do
more
than
all
the
rest
do
fool
yourself
capitan
tiago
had
great
respect
for
this
chinese
who
passed
himself
off
as
a
prophet
and
a
physician
examining
the
palm
of
the
deceased
lady
just
before
her
daughter
was
born
he
had
prognosticated
if
it
not
a
boy
and
does
die
it
be
a
fine
girl
and
maria
clara
had
come
into
the
world
to
fulfill
the
infidel
prophecy
capitan
tiago
then
as
a
prudent
and
cautious
man
could
not
decide
so
easily
as
trojan
paris
he
could
not
so
lightly
give
the
preference
to
one
virgin
for
fear
of
offending
another
a
situation
that
might
be
fraught
with
grave
consequences
prudence
he
said
to
himself
not
go
and
spoil
it
all
now
he
was
still
in
the
midst
of
these
doubts
when
the
governmental
party
arrived
doña
victorina
don
tiburcio
and
linares
doña
victorina
did
the
talking
for
the
three
men
as
well
as
for
herself
she
mentioned
linares
visits
to
the
and
repeatedly
insinuated
the
advantages
of
a
relative
of
quality
now
she
concluded
as
we
was
zaying
he
who
zhelterz
himzelf
well
builds
a
good
roof
other
corrected
the
doctor
for
some
days
now
she
had
been
endeavoring
to
her
speech
and
no
one
had
been
able
to
get
this
idea
out
of
her
head
she
would
sooner
have
first
let
them
tear
off
her
false
frizzes
yez
she
went
on
speaking
of
ibarra
he
deserves
it
all
i
told
you
zo
when
i
first
zaw
him
he
a
filibuzter
what
did
the
general
zay
to
you
cousin
what
did
he
zay
what
news
did
he
tell
you
about
thiz
ibarra
seeing
that
her
cousin
was
slow
in
answering
she
continued
directing
her
remarks
to
capitan
tiago
believe
me
if
they
zentenz
him
to
death
as
is
to
be
hoped
it
be
on
account
of
my
cousin
señora
señora
protested
linares
but
she
gave
him
no
time
for
objections
how
diplomatic
you
have
become
we
know
that
you
the
adviser
of
the
general
that
he
could
live
without
you
ah
clarita
what
a
pleasure
to
zee
you
maria
clara
was
still
pale
although
now
quite
recovered
from
her
illness
her
long
hair
was
tied
up
with
a
light
blue
silk
ribbon
with
a
timid
bow
and
a
sad
smile
she
went
up
to
doña
victorina
for
the
ceremonial
kiss
after
the
usual
conventional
remarks
the
continued
we
come
to
visit
you
you
been
zaved
thankz
to
your
relations
this
was
said
with
a
significant
glance
toward
linares
god
has
protected
my
father
replied
the
girl
in
a
low
voice
yez
clarita
but
the
time
of
the
miracles
is
pazt
we
zpaniards
zay
in
the
virgin
and
take
to
your
heels
other
capitan
tiago
who
had
up
to
this
point
had
no
chance
to
speak
now
made
bold
enough
to
ask
while
he
threw
himself
into
an
attitude
of
strict
attention
so
you
doña
victorina
think
that
the
virgin
we
come
ezpezially
to
talk
with
you
about
the
virgin
she
answered
mysteriously
making
a
sign
toward
maria
clara
we
come
to
talk
business
the
maiden
understood
that
she
was
expected
to
retire
so
with
an
excuse
she
went
away
supporting
herself
on
the
furniture
what
was
said
and
what
was
agreed
upon
in
this
conference
was
so
sordid
and
mean
that
we
prefer
not
to
recount
it
it
is
enough
to
record
that
as
they
took
their
leave
they
were
all
merry
and
that
afterwards
capitan
tiago
said
to
aunt
isabel
notify
the
restaurant
that
we
have
a
fiesta
tomorrow
get
maria
ready
for
we
going
to
marry
her
off
before
long
aunt
isabel
stared
at
him
in
consternation
you
see
when
señor
linares
is
our
we
get
into
all
the
palaces
every
one
will
envy
us
every
one
will
die
of
envy
thus
it
happened
that
at
eight
on
the
following
evening
the
house
of
capitan
tiago
was
once
again
filled
but
this
time
his
guests
were
only
spaniards
and
chinese
the
fair
sex
was
represented
by
peninsular
and
ladies
there
were
present
the
greater
part
of
our
acquaintances
padre
sibyla
and
padre
salvi
among
various
franciscans
and
dominicans
the
old
lieutenant
of
the
civil
guard
señor
guevara
gloomier
than
ever
the
alferez
who
was
for
the
thousandth
time
describing
his
battle
and
gazing
over
his
shoulders
at
every
one
believing
himself
to
be
a
don
john
of
austria
for
he
was
now
a
major
de
espadaña
who
looked
at
the
alferez
with
respect
and
fear
and
avoided
his
gaze
and
doña
victorina
swelling
with
indignation
linares
had
not
yet
come
as
a
personage
of
importance
he
had
to
arrive
later
than
the
others
there
are
creatures
so
simple
that
by
being
an
hour
behind
time
they
transform
themselves
into
great
men
in
the
group
of
women
maria
clara
was
the
subject
of
a
murmured
conversation
the
maiden
had
welcomed
them
all
ceremoniously
without
losing
her
air
of
sadness
pish
remarked
one
young
woman
the
proud
little
thing
pretty
little
thing
responded
another
but
he
might
have
picked
out
some
other
girl
with
a
less
foolish
face
the
gold
child
the
good
youth
is
selling
himself
in
another
part
the
comments
ran
thus
to
get
married
when
her
first
fiancé
is
about
to
be
hanged
that
what
called
prudence
having
a
substitute
ready
well
when
she
gets
to
be
a
widow
maria
clara
was
seated
in
a
chair
arranging
a
salver
of
flowers
and
doubtless
heard
all
these
remarks
for
her
hand
trembled
she
turned
pale
and
several
times
bit
her
lips
in
the
circle
of
men
the
conversation
was
carried
on
in
loud
tones
and
naturally
turned
upon
recent
events
all
were
talking
even
don
tiburcio
with
the
exception
of
padre
sibyla
who
maintained
his
usual
disdainful
silence
i
heard
it
said
that
your
reverence
is
leaving
the
town
padre
salvi
inquired
the
new
major
whose
fresh
star
had
made
him
more
amiable
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
there
i
going
to
stay
permanently
in
manila
and
you
i
also
leaving
the
town
answered
the
swelling
up
the
government
needs
me
to
command
a
flying
column
to
clean
the
provinces
of
filibusters
fray
sibyla
looked
him
over
rapidly
from
head
to
foot
and
then
turned
his
back
completely
is
it
known
for
certain
what
will
become
of
the
ringleader
the
filibuster
inquired
a
government
employee
do
you
mean
crisostomo
ibarra
asked
another
the
most
likely
and
most
just
thing
is
that
he
will
be
hanged
like
those
of
he
going
to
be
deported
remarked
the
old
lieutenant
dryly
deported
nothing
more
than
deported
but
it
will
be
a
perpetual
deportation
exclaimed
several
voices
at
the
same
time
if
that
young
man
continued
the
lieutenant
guevara
in
a
loud
and
severe
tone
had
been
more
cautious
if
he
had
confided
less
in
certain
persons
with
whom
he
corresponded
if
our
prosecutors
did
not
know
how
to
interpret
so
subtly
what
is
written
that
young
man
would
surely
have
been
acquitted
this
declaration
on
the
part
of
the
old
lieutenant
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
produced
great
surprise
among
his
hearers
who
were
apparently
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
say
padre
salvi
stared
in
another
direction
perhaps
to
avoid
the
gloomy
look
that
the
old
soldier
turned
on
him
maria
clara
let
her
flowers
fall
and
remained
motionless
padre
sibyla
who
knew
so
well
how
to
be
silent
seemed
also
to
be
the
only
one
who
knew
how
to
ask
a
question
you
speaking
of
letters
señor
guevara
i
speaking
of
what
was
told
me
by
his
lawyer
who
looked
after
the
case
with
interest
and
zeal
outside
of
some
ambiguous
lines
which
this
youth
wrote
to
a
woman
before
he
left
for
europe
lines
in
which
the
government
attorney
saw
a
plot
and
a
threat
against
the
government
and
which
he
acknowledged
to
be
his
there
was
anything
found
to
accuse
him
of
but
the
declaration
of
the
outlaw
before
he
died
his
lawyer
had
that
thrown
out
because
according
to
the
outlaw
himself
they
had
never
communicated
with
the
young
man
but
with
a
certain
lucas
who
was
an
enemy
of
his
as
could
be
proved
and
who
committed
suicide
perhaps
from
remorse
it
was
proved
that
the
papers
found
on
the
corpse
were
forged
since
the
handwriting
was
like
that
of
señor
ibarra
seven
years
ago
but
not
like
his
now
which
leads
to
the
belief
that
the
model
for
them
may
have
been
that
incriminating
letter
besides
the
lawyer
says
that
if
señor
ibarra
had
refused
to
acknowledge
the
letter
he
might
have
been
able
to
do
a
great
deal
for
him
but
at
sight
of
the
letter
he
turned
pale
lost
his
courage
and
confirmed
everything
written
in
it
did
you
say
that
the
letter
was
directed
to
a
woman
asked
a
franciscan
how
did
it
get
into
the
hands
of
the
prosecutor
the
lieutenant
did
not
answer
he
stared
for
a
moment
at
padre
salvi
and
then
moved
away
nervously
twisting
the
sharp
point
of
his
gray
beard
the
others
made
their
comments
there
is
seen
the
hand
of
god
remarked
one
even
the
women
hate
him
he
had
his
house
burned
down
thinking
in
that
way
to
save
himself
but
he
did
count
on
the
guest
on
his
his
added
another

meanwhile
the
old
soldier
paused
in
his
pacing
about
and
approached
maria
clara
who
was
listening
to
the
conversation
motionless
in
her
chair
with
the
flowers
scattered
at
her
feet
you
are
a
very
prudent
girl
the
old
officer
whispered
to
her
you
did
well
to
give
up
the
letter
you
have
thus
assured
yourself
an
untroubled
future
with
startled
eyes
she
watched
him
move
away
from
her
and
bit
her
lip
fortunately
aunt
isabel
came
along
and
she
had
sufficient
strength
left
to
catch
hold
of
the
old
lady
skirt
aunt
she
murmured
what
the
matter
asked
the
old
lady
frightened
by
the
look
on
the
girl
face
take
me
to
my
room
she
pleaded
grasping
her
aunt
arm
in
order
to
rise
are
you
sick
daughter
you
look
as
if
you
lost
your
bones
the
matter
a
fainting

in
the

so
many

that
i
going
to
sleep

do
you
want
some
tea
maria
clara
shook
her
head
entered
and
locked
the
door
of
her
chamber
and
then
her
strength
failing
her
she
fell
sobbing
to
the
floor
at
the
feet
of
an
image
mother
mother
mother
mine
she
sobbed
through
the
window
and
a
door
that
opened
on
the
azotea
the
moonlight
entered
the
musicians
continued
to
play
merry
waltzes
laughter
and
the
hum
of
voices
penetrated
into
the
chamber
several
times
her
father
aunt
isabel
doña
victorina
and
even
linares
knocked
at
the
door
but
maria
did
not
move
heavy
sobs
shook
her
breast
hours
passed
the
pleasures
of
the
ended
the
sound
of
singing
and
dancing
was
heard
the
candle
burned
itself
out
but
the
maiden
still
remained
motionless
on
the
moonlit
floor
at
the
feet
of
an
image
of
the
mother
of
jesus
gradually
the
house
became
quiet
again
the
lights
were
extinguished
and
aunt
isabel
once
more
knocked
at
the
door
well
she
gone
to
sleep
said
the
old
woman
aloud
as
young
and
has
no
cares
she
sleeps
like
a
corpse
when
all
was
silence
she
raised
herself
slowly
and
threw
a
look
about
her
she
saw
the
azotea
with
its
little
arbors
bathed
in
the
ghostly
light
of
the
moon
an
untroubled
future
she
sleeps
like
a
corpse
she
repeated
in
a
low
voice
as
she
made
her
way
out
to
the
azotea
the
city
slept
only
from
time
to
time
there
was
heard
the
noise
of
a
carriage
crossing
the
wooden
bridge
over
the
river
whose
undisturbed
waters
reflected
smoothly
the
light
of
the
moon
the
young
woman
raised
her
eyes
toward
a
sky
as
clear
as
sapphire
slowly
she
took
the
rings
from
her
fingers
and
from
her
ears
and
removed
the
combs
from
her
hair
placing
them
on
the
balustrade
of
the
azotea
she
gazed
toward
the
river
a
small
banka
loaded
with
zacate
stopped
at
the
foot
of
the
landing
such
as
every
house
on
the
bank
of
the
river
has
one
of
two
men
who
were
in
it
ran
up
the
stone
stairway
and
jumped
over
the
wall
and
a
few
seconds
later
his
footsteps
were
heard
on
the
stairs
leading
to
the
azotea
maria
clara
saw
him
pause
on
discovering
her
but
only
for
a
moment
then
he
advanced
slowly
and
stopped
within
a
few
paces
of
her
maria
clara
recoiled
crisostomo
she
murmured
overcome
with
fright
yes
i
am
crisostomo
replied
the
young
man
gravely
an
enemy
a
man
who
has
every
reason
for
hating
me
elias
has
rescued
me
from
the
prison
into
which
my
friends
threw
me
a
sad
silence
followed
these
words
maria
clara
bowed
her
head
and
let
her
arms
fall
ibarra
went
on
beside
my
mother
corpse
i
swore
that
i
would
make
you
happy
whatever
might
be
my
destiny
you
can
have
been
faithless
to
your
oath
for
she
was
not
your
mother
but
i
i
who
am
her
son
hold
her
memory
so
sacred
that
in
spite
of
a
thousand
difficulties
i
have
come
here
to
carry
mine
out
and
fate
has
willed
that
i
should
speak
to
you
yourself
maria
we
shall
never
see
each
other
again
you
are
young
and
perhaps
some
day
your
conscience
may
reproach
you
i
have
come
to
tell
you
before
i
go
away
forever
that
i
forgive
you
now
may
you
be
happy
and
farewell
ibarra
started
to
move
away
but
the
girl
stopped
him
crisostomo
she
said
god
has
sent
you
to
save
me
from
desperation
hear
me
and
then
judge
me
ibarra
tried
gently
to
draw
away
from
her
i
did
come
to
call
you
to
account
i
came
to
give
you
peace
i
do
want
that
peace
which
you
bring
me
peace
i
will
give
myself
you
despise
me
and
your
contempt
will
embitter
all
the
rest
of
my
life
ibarra
read
the
despair
and
sorrow
depicted
in
the
suffering
face
and
asked
her
what
she
wished
that
you
believe
that
i
have
always
loved
you
at
this
he
smiled
bitterly
ah
you
doubt
me
you
doubt
the
friend
of
your
childhood
who
has
never
hidden
a
single
thought
from
you
the
maiden
exclaimed
sorrowfully
i
understand
now
but
when
you
hear
my
story
the
sad
story
that
was
revealed
to
me
during
my
illness
you
will
have
mercy
on
me
you
will
not
have
that
smile
for
my
sorrow
why
did
you
not
let
me
die
in
the
hands
of
my
ignorant
physician
you
and
i
both
would
have
been
happier
resting
a
moment
she
then
went
on
you
have
desired
it
you
have
doubted
me
but
may
my
mother
forgive
me
on
one
of
the
sorrowfulest
of
my
nights
of
suffering
a
man
revealed
to
me
the
name
of
my
real
father
and
forbade
me
to
love
you
except
that
my
father
himself
should
pardon
the
injury
you
had
done
him
ibarra
recoiled
a
pace
and
gazed
fearfully
at
her
yes
she
continued
that
man
told
me
that
he
could
not
permit
our
union
since
his
conscience
would
forbid
it
and
that
he
would
be
obliged
to
reveal
the
name
of
my
real
father
at
the
risk
of
causing
a
great
scandal
for
my
father
is
and
she
murmured
into
the
ear
a
name
in
so
low
a
tone
that
only
he
could
have
heard
it
what
was
i
to
do
must
i
sacrifice
to
my
love
the
memory
of
my
mother
the
honor
of
my
supposed
father
and
the
good
name
of
the
real
one
could
i
have
done
that
without
having
even
you
despise
me
but
the
proof
had
you
any
proof
you
needed
proofs
exclaimed
ibarra
trembling
with
emotion
the
maiden
snatched
two
papers
from
her
bosom
two
letters
of
my
mother
two
letters
written
in
the
midst
of
her
remorse
while
i
was
yet
unborn
take
them
read
them
and
you
will
see
how
she
cursed
me
and
wished
for
my
death
which
my
father
vainly
tried
to
bring
about
with
drugs
these
letters
he
had
forgotten
in
a
building
where
he
had
lived
the
other
man
found
and
preserved
them
and
only
gave
them
up
to
me
in
exchange
for
your
letter
in
order
to
assure
himself
so
he
said
that
i
would
not
marry
you
without
the
consent
of
my
father
since
i
have
been
carrying
them
about
with
me
in
place
of
your
letter
i
have
felt
the
chill
in
my
heart
i
sacrificed
you
i
sacrificed
my
love
what
else
could
one
do
for
a
dead
mother
and
two
living
fathers
could
i
have
suspected
the
use
that
was
to
be
made
of
your
letter
ibarra
stood
appalled
while
she
continued
what
more
was
left
for
me
to
do
could
i
perhaps
tell
you
who
my
father
was
could
i
tell
you
that
you
should
beg
forgiveness
of
him
who
made
your
father
suffer
so
much
could
i
ask
my
father
that
he
forgive
you
could
i
tell
him
that
i
knew
that
i
was
his
daughter
him
who
desired
my
death
so
eagerly
it
was
only
left
to
me
to
suffer
to
guard
the
secret
and
to
die
suffering
now
my
friend
now
that
you
know
the
sad
history
of
your
poor
maria
will
you
still
have
for
her
that
disdainful
smile
maria
you
are
an
angel
then
i
am
happy
since
you
believe
me
but
yet
added
the
youth
with
a
change
of
tone
i
heard
that
you
are
going
to
be
married
yes
sobbed
the
girl
my
father
demands
this
sacrifice
he
has
loved
me
and
cared
for
me
when
it
was
not
his
duty
to
do
so
and
i
will
pay
this
debt
of
gratitude
to
assure
his
peace
by
means
of
this
new
relationship
but
but
what
i
will
never
forget
the
vows
of
faithfulness
that
i
have
made
to
you
what
are
you
thinking
of
doing
asked
ibarra
trying
to
read
the
look
in
her
eyes
the
future
is
dark
and
my
destiny
is
wrapped
in
gloom
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
but
know
that
i
have
loved
but
once
and
that
without
love
i
will
never
belong
to
any
man
and
you
what
is
going
to
become
of
you
i
am
only
a
fugitive
i
am
fleeing
in
a
little
while
my
flight
will
have
been
discovered
maria
maria
clara
caught
the
youth
head
in
her
hands
and
kissed
him
repeatedly
on
the
lips
embraced
him
and
drew
abruptly
away
go
go
she
cried
go
and
farewell
ibarra
gazed
at
her
with
shining
eyes
but
at
a
gesture
from
her
moved
away
intoxicated
wavering
once
again
he
leaped
over
the
wall
and
stepped
into
the
banka
maria
clara
leaning
over
the
balustrade
watched
him
depart
elias
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
to
her
profoundly
chapter
lxi
the
chase
on
the
lake
listen
sir
to
the
plan
that
i
have
worked
out
said
elias
thoughtfully
as
they
moved
in
the
direction
of
san
gabriel
hide
you
now
in
the
house
of
a
friend
of
mine
in
mandaluyong
bring
you
all
your
money
which
i
saved
and
buried
at
the
foot
of
the
balete
in
the
mysterious
tomb
of
your
grandfather
then
you
will
leave
the
country
to
go
abroad
inquired
ibarra
to
live
out
in
peace
the
days
of
life
that
remain
to
you
you
have
friends
in
spain
you
are
rich
you
can
get
yourself
pardoned
in
every
way
a
foreign
country
is
for
us
a
better
fatherland
than
our
own
crisostomo
did
not
answer
but
meditated
in
silence
at
that
moment
they
reached
the
pasig
and
the
banka
began
to
ascend
the
current
over
the
bridge
of
spain
a
horseman
galloped
rapidly
while
a
shrill
prolonged
whistle
was
heard
elias
said
ibarra
you
owe
your
misfortunes
to
my
family
you
have
saved
my
life
twice
and
i
owe
you
not
only
gratitude
but
also
the
restitution
of
your
fortune
you
advise
me
to
go
abroad
then
come
with
me
and
we
will
live
like
brothers
here
you
also
are
wretched
elias
shook
his
head
sadly
and
answered
impossible
it
true
that
i
can
not
love
or
be
happy
in
my
country
but
i
can
suffer
and
die
in
it
and
perhaps
for
it
that
is
always
something
may
the
misfortunes
of
my
native
land
be
my
own
misfortunes
and
although
no
noble
sentiment
unites
us
although
our
hearts
do
not
beat
to
a
single
name
at
least
may
the
common
calamity
bind
me
to
my
countrymen
at
least
may
i
weep
over
our
sorrows
with
them
may
the
same
hard
fate
oppress
all
our
hearts
alike
then
why
do
you
advise
me
to
go
away
because
in
some
other
country
you
could
be
happy
while
i
could
not
because
you
are
not
made
to
suffer
and
because
you
would
hate
your
country
if
some
day
you
should
see
yourself
ruined
in
its
cause
and
to
hate
one
native
land
is
the
greatest
of
calamities
you
are
unfair
to
me
exclaimed
ibarra
with
bitter
reproach
you
forget
that
scarcely
had
i
arrived
here
when
i
set
myself
to
seek
its
welfare
do
be
offended
sir
i
was
not
reproaching
you
at
all
would
that
all
of
us
could
imitate
you
but
i
do
not
ask
impossibilities
of
you
and
i
mean
no
offense
when
i
say
that
your
heart
deceives
you
you
loved
your
country
because
your
father
taught
you
to
do
so
you
loved
it
because
in
it
you
had
affection
fortune
youth
because
everything
smiled
on
you
your
country
had
done
you
no
injustice
you
loved
it
as
we
love
anything
that
makes
us
happy
but
the
day
in
which
you
see
yourself
poor
and
hungry
persecuted
betrayed
and
sold
by
your
own
countrymen
on
that
day
you
will
disown
yourself
your
country
and
all
mankind
your
words
pain
me
said
ibarra
resentfully
elias
bowed
his
head
and
meditated
before
replying
i
wish
to
disillusion
you
sir
and
save
you
from
a
sad
future
recall
that
night
when
i
talked
to
you
in
this
same
banka
under
the
light
of
this
same
moon
not
a
month
ago
then
you
were
happy
the
plea
of
the
unfortunates
did
not
touch
you
you
disdained
their
complaints
because
they
were
the
complaints
of
criminals
you
paid
more
attention
to
their
enemies
and
in
spite
of
my
arguments
and
petitions
you
placed
yourself
on
the
side
of
their
oppressors
on
you
then
depended
whether
i
should
turn
criminal
or
allow
myself
to
be
killed
in
order
to
carry
out
a
sacred
pledge
but
god
has
not
permitted
this
because
the
old
chief
of
the
outlaws
is
dead
a
month
has
hardly
passed
and
you
think
otherwise
you
right
elias
but
man
is
a
creature
of
circumstances
then
i
was
blind
annoyed
what
did
i
know
now
misfortune
has
torn
the
bandage
from
my
eyes
the
solitude
and
misery
of
my
prison
have
taught
me
now
i
see
the
horrible
cancer
which
feeds
upon
this
society
which
clutches
its
flesh
and
which
demands
a
violent
rooting
out
they
have
opened
my
eyes
they
have
made
me
see
the
sore
and
they
force
me
to
be
a
criminal
since
they
wish
it
i
will
be
a
filibuster
a
real
filibuster
i
mean
i
will
call
together
all
the
unfortunates
all
who
feel
a
heart
beat
in
their
breasts
all
those
who
were
sending
you
to
me
no
i
will
not
be
a
criminal
never
is
he
such
who
fights
for
his
native
land
but
quite
the
reverse
we
during
three
centuries
have
extended
them
our
hands
we
have
asked
love
of
them
we
have
yearned
to
call
them
brothers
and
how
do
they
answer
us
with
insults
and
jests
denying
us
even
the
chance
character
of
human
beings
there
is
no
god
there
is
no
hope
there
is
no
humanity
there
is
nothing
but
the
right
of
might
ibarra
was
nervous
his
whole
body
trembled
as
they
passed
in
front
of
the
palace
they
thought
that
they
could
discern
movement
and
excitement
among
the
guards
can
they
have
discovered
your
flight
murmured
elias
lie
down
sir
so
that
i
can
cover
you
with
zacate
since
we
shall
pass
near
the
it
may
seem
suspicious
to
the
sentinel
that
there
are
two
of
us
the
banka
was
one
of
those
small
narrow
canoes
that
do
not
seem
to
float
but
rather
to
glide
over
the
top
of
the
water
as
elias
had
foreseen
the
sentinel
stopped
him
and
inquired
whence
he
came
from
manila
to
carry
zacate
to
the
judges
and
curates
he
answered
imitating
the
accent
of
the
people
of
pandakan
a
sergeant
came
out
to
learn
what
was
happening
move
on
he
said
to
elias
but
i
warn
you
not
to
take
anybody
into
your
banka
a
prisoner
has
just
escaped
if
you
capture
him
and
turn
him
over
to
me
i
give
you
a
good
tip
all
right
sir
what
his
description
he
wears
a
sack
coat
and
talks
spanish
so
look
out
the
banka
moved
away
elias
looked
back
and
watched
the
silhouette
of
the
sentinel
standing
on
the
bank
of
the
river
we
lose
a
few
minutes
time
he
said
in
a
low
voice
we
must
go
into
the
beata
river
to
pretend
that
i
from
peñafrancia
you
will
see
the
river
of
which
francisco
baltazar
sang
the
town
slept
in
the
moonlight
and
crisostomo
rose
up
to
admire
the
sepulchral
peace
of
nature
the
river
was
narrow
and
the
level
land
on
either
side
covered
with
grass
elias
threw
his
cargo
out
on
the
bank
and
after
removing
a
large
piece
of
bamboo
took
from
under
the
grass
some
empty
sacks
then
they
continued
on
their
way
you
are
the
master
of
your
own
will
sir
and
of
your
future
he
said
to
crisostomo
who
had
remained
silent
but
if
you
will
allow
me
an
observation
i
would
say
think
well
what
you
are
planning
to
do
you
are
going
to
light
the
flames
of
war
since
you
have
money
and
brains
and
you
will
quickly
find
many
to
join
you
for
unfortunately
there
are
plenty
of
malcontents
but
in
this
struggle
which
you
are
going
to
undertake
those
who
will
suffer
most
will
be
the
defenseless
and
the
innocent
the
same
sentiments
that
a
month
ago
impelled
me
to
appeal
to
you
asking
for
reforms
are
those
that
move
me
now
to
urge
you
to
think
well
the
country
sir
does
not
think
of
separating
from
the
mother
country
it
only
asks
for
a
little
freedom
justice
and
affection
you
will
be
supported
by
the
malcontents
the
criminals
the
desperate
but
the
people
will
hold
aloof
you
are
mistaken
if
seeing
all
dark
you
think
that
the
country
is
desperate
the
country
suffers
yes
but
it
still
hopes
and
trusts
and
will
only
rebel
when
it
has
lost
its
patience
that
is
when
those
who
govern
it
wish
it
to
do
so
and
that
time
is
yet
distant
i
myself
will
not
follow
you
never
will
i
resort
to
such
extreme
measures
while
i
see
hope
in
men
then
i
go
on
without
you
responded
ibarra
resolutely
is
your
decision
final
final
and
firm
let
the
memory
of
my
mother
bear
witness
i
will
not
let
peace
and
happiness
be
torn
away
from
me
with
impunity
i
who
desired
only
what
was
good
i
who
have
respected
everything
and
endured
everything
out
of
love
for
a
hypocritical
religion
and
out
of
love
of
country
how
have
they
answered
me
by
burying
me
in
an
infamous
dungeon
and
robbing
me
of
my
intended
wife
no
not
to
avenge
myself
would
be
a
crime
it
would
be
encouraging
them
to
new
acts
of
injustice
no
it
would
be
cowardice
pusillanimity
to
groan
and
weep
when
there
is
blood
and
life
left
when
to
insult
and
menace
is
added
mockery
i
will
call
out
these
ignorant
people
i
will
make
them
see
their
misery
i
will
teach
them
to
think
not
of
brotherhood
but
only
that
they
are
wolves
for
devouring
i
will
urge
them
to
rise
against
this
oppression
and
proclaim
the
eternal
right
of
man
to
win
his
freedom
but
innocent
people
will
suffer
so
much
the
better
can
you
take
me
to
the
mountains
until
you
are
in
safety
replied
elias
again
they
moved
out
into
the
pasig
talking
from
time
to
time
of
indifferent
matters
santa
ana
murmured
ibarra
do
you
recognize
this
building
they
were
passing
in
front
of
the
of
the
jesuits
there
i
spent
many
pleasant
and
happy
days
sighed
elias
in
my
time
we
came
every
month
then
i
was
like
others
i
had
a
fortune
family
i
dreamed
i
looked
forward
to
a
future
in
those
days
i
saw
my
sister
in
the
college
she
presented
me
with
a
piece
of
her
own
a
friend
used
to
accompany
her
a
beautiful
girl
all
that
has
passed
like
a
dream
they
remained
silent
until
they
reached
those
who
have
ever
made
their
way
by
night
up
the
pasig
on
one
of
those
magical
nights
that
the
philippines
offers
when
the
moon
pours
out
from
the
limpid
blue
her
melancholy
light
when
the
shadows
hide
the
miseries
of
man
and
the
silence
is
unbroken
by
the
sordid
accents
of
his
voice
when
only
nature
speaks
they
will
understand
the
thoughts
of
both
these
youths
at
the
carbineer
was
sleepy
and
seeing
that
the
banka
was
empty
and
offered
no
booty
which
he
might
seize
according
to
the
traditional
usage
of
his
corps
and
the
custom
of
that
post
he
easily
let
them
pass
on
nor
did
the
at
pasig
suspect
anything
so
they
were
not
molested
day
was
beginning
to
break
when
they
reached
the
lake
still
and
calm
like
a
gigantic
mirror
the
moon
paled
and
the
east
was
dyed
in
rosy
tints
some
distance
away
they
perceived
a
gray
mass
advancing
slowly
toward
them
the
police
boat
is
coming
murmured
elias
lie
down
and
i
cover
you
with
these
sacks
the
outlines
of
the
boat
became
clearer
and
plainer
it
getting
between
us
and
the
shore
observed
elias
uneasily
gradually
he
changed
the
course
of
his
banka
rowing
toward
binangonan
to
his
great
surprise
he
noticed
that
the
boat
also
changed
its
course
while
a
voice
called
to
him
elias
stopped
rowing
and
reflected
the
shore
was
still
far
away
and
they
would
soon
be
within
range
of
the
rifles
on
the
police
boat
he
thought
of
returning
to
pasig
for
his
banka
was
the
swifter
of
the
two
boats
but
unluckily
he
saw
another
boat
coming
from
the
river
and
made
out
the
gleam
of
caps
and
bayonets
of
the
civil
guard
we
caught
he
muttered
turning
pale
he
gazed
at
his
robust
arms
and
adopting
the
only
course
left
began
to
row
with
all
his
might
toward
talim
island
just
as
the
sun
was
rising
the
banka
slipped
rapidly
along
elias
saw
standing
on
the
boat
which
had
veered
about
some
men
making
signals
to
him
do
you
know
how
to
manage
a
banka
he
asked
ibarra
yes
why
because
we
are
lost
if
i
do
jump
into
the
water
and
throw
them
off
the
track
they
will
pursue
me
but
i
swim
and
dive
well
draw
them
away
from
you
and
then
you
can
save
yourself
no
stay
here
and
we
sell
our
lives
dearly
that
would
be
useless
we
have
no
arms
and
with
their
rifles
they
would
shoot
us
down
like
birds
at
that
instant
the
water
gave
forth
a
hiss
such
as
is
caused
by
the
falling
of
hot
metal
into
it
followed
instantaneously
by
a
loud
report
you
see
said
elias
placing
the
paddle
in
the
boat
we
see
each
other
on
christmas
eve
at
the
tomb
of
your
grandfather
save
yourself
and
you
god
has
carried
me
safely
through
greater
perils
as
elias
took
off
his
camisa
a
bullet
tore
it
from
his
hands
and
two
loud
reports
were
heard
calmly
he
clasped
the
hand
of
ibarra
who
was
still
stretched
out
in
the
bottom
of
the
banka
then
he
arose
and
leaped
into
the
water
at
the
same
time
pushing
the
little
craft
away
from
him
with
his
foot
cries
resounded
and
soon
some
distance
away
the
youth
head
appeared
as
if
for
breathing
then
instantly
disappeared
there
there
he
is
cried
several
voices
and
again
the
bullets
whistled
the
police
boat
and
the
boat
from
the
pasig
now
started
in
pursuit
of
him
a
light
track
indicated
his
passage
through
the
water
as
he
drew
farther
and
farther
away
from
ibarra
banka
which
floated
about
as
if
abandoned
every
time
the
swimmer
lifted
his
head
above
the
water
to
breathe
the
guards
in
both
boats
shot
at
him
so
the
chase
continued
ibarra
little
banka
was
now
far
away
and
the
swimmer
was
approaching
the
shore
distant
some
thirty
yards
the
rowers
were
tired
but
elias
was
in
the
same
condition
for
he
showed
his
head
oftener
and
each
time
in
a
different
direction
as
if
to
disconcert
his
pursuers
no
longer
did
the
treacherous
track
indicate
the
position
of
the
diver
they
saw
him
for
the
last
time
when
he
was
some
ten
yards
from
the
shore
and
fired
then
minute
after
minute
passed
but
nothing
again
appeared
above
the
still
and
solitary
surface
of
the
lake
half
an
hour
afterwards
one
of
the
rowers
claimed
that
he
could
distinguish
in
the
water
near
the
shore
traces
of
blood
but
his
companions
shook
their
heads
dubiously
chapter
lxii
padre
damaso
explains
vainly
were
the
rich
wedding
presents
heaped
upon
a
table
neither
the
diamonds
in
their
cases
of
blue
velvet
nor
the
piña
embroideries
nor
the
rolls
of
silk
drew
the
gaze
of
maria
clara
without
reading
or
even
seeing
it
the
maiden
sat
staring
at
the
newspaper
which
gave
an
account
of
the
death
of
ibarra
drowned
in
the
lake
suddenly
she
felt
two
hands
placed
over
her
eyes
to
hold
her
fast
and
heard
padre
damaso
voice
ask
merrily
who
am
i
who
am
i
maria
clara
sprang
from
her
seat
and
gazed
at
him
in
terror
foolish
little
girl
you
not
afraid
are
you
you
were
expecting
me
eh
well
i
come
in
from
the
provinces
to
attend
your
wedding
he
smiled
with
satisfaction
as
he
drew
nearer
to
her
and
held
out
his
hand
for
her
to
kiss
maria
clara
approached
him
tremblingly
and
touched
his
hand
respectfully
to
her
lips
what
the
matter
with
you
maria
asked
the
franciscan
losing
his
merry
smile
and
becoming
uneasy
your
hand
is
cold
you
pale
are
you
ill
little
girl
padre
damaso
drew
her
toward
himself
with
a
tenderness
that
one
would
hardly
have
thought
him
capable
of
and
catching
both
her
hands
in
his
questioned
her
with
his
gaze
do
you
have
confidence
in
your
godfather
any
more
he
asked
reproachfully
come
sit
down
and
tell
me
your
little
troubles
as
you
used
to
do
when
you
were
a
child
when
you
wanted
tapers
to
make
wax
dolls
you
know
that
i
always
loved
you
i
never
been
cross
with
you
his
voice
was
now
no
longer
brusque
and
even
became
tenderly
modulated
maria
clara
began
to
weep
you
crying
little
girl
why
do
you
cry
have
you
quarreled
with
linares
maria
clara
covered
her
ears
do
speak
of
him
not
now
she
cried
padre
damaso
gazed
at
her
in
startled
wonder
wo
you
trust
me
with
your
secrets
have
i
always
tried
to
satisfy
your
lightest
whim
the
maiden
raised
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
stared
at
him
for
a
long
time
then
again
fell
to
weeping
bitterly
do
cry
so
little
girl
your
tears
hurt
me
tell
me
your
troubles
and
you
see
how
your
godfather
loves
you
maria
clara
approached
him
slowly
fell
upon
her
knees
and
raising
her
face
toward
his
asked
in
a
low
scarcely
audible
tone
do
you
still
love
me
child
then
protect
my
father
and
break
off
my
marriage
here
the
maiden
told
of
her
last
interview
with
ibarra
concealing
only
her
knowledge
of
the
secret
of
her
birth
padre
damaso
could
scarcely
credit
his
ears
while
he
lived
the
girl
continued
i
thought
of
struggling
i
was
hoping
trusting
i
wanted
to
live
so
that
i
might
hear
of
him
but
now
that
they
have
killed
him
now
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
live
and
suffer
she
spoke
in
low
measured
tones
calmly
tearlessly
but
foolish
girl
is
linares
a
thousand
times
better
than
while
he
lived
i
could
have
married
i
thought
of
running
away
afterwards
my
father
wants
only
the
relationship
but
now
that
he
is
dead
no
other
man
shall
call
me
wife
while
he
was
alive
i
could
debase
myself
for
there
would
have
remained
the
consolation
that
he
lived
and
perhaps
thought
of
me
but
now
that
he
is
dead
the
nunnery
or
the
tomb
the
girl
voice
had
a
ring
of
firmness
in
it
such
that
padre
damaso
lost
his
merry
air
and
became
very
thoughtful
did
you
love
him
as
much
as
that
he
stammered
maria
clara
did
not
answer
padre
damaso
dropped
his
head
on
his
chest
and
remained
silent
for
a
long
time
daughter
in
god
he
exclaimed
at
length
in
a
broken
voice
forgive
me
for
having
made
you
unhappy
without
knowing
it
i
was
thinking
of
your
future
i
desired
your
happiness
how
could
i
permit
you
to
marry
a
native
of
the
country
to
see
you
an
unhappy
wife
and
a
wretched
mother
i
could
get
that
love
out
of
your
head
even
though
i
opposed
it
with
all
my
might
i
committed
wrongs
for
you
solely
for
you
if
you
had
become
his
wife
you
would
have
mourned
afterwards
over
the
condition
of
your
husband
exposed
to
all
kinds
of
vexations
without
means
of
defense
as
a
mother
you
would
have
mourned
the
fate
of
your
sons
if
you
had
educated
them
you
would
have
prepared
for
them
a
sad
future
for
they
would
have
become
enemies
of
religion
and
you
would
have
seen
them
garroted
or
exiled
if
you
had
kept
them
ignorant
you
would
have
seen
them
tyrannized
over
and
degraded
i
could
not
consent
to
it
for
this
reason
i
sought
for
you
a
husband
that
could
make
you
the
happy
mother
of
sons
who
would
command
and
not
obey
who
would
punish
and
not
suffer
i
knew
that
the
friend
of
your
childhood
was
good
i
liked
him
as
well
as
his
father
but
i
have
hated
them
both
since
i
saw
that
they
were
going
to
bring
about
your
unhappiness
because
i
love
you
i
adore
you
i
love
you
as
one
loves
his
own
daughter
yours
is
my
only
affection
i
have
seen
you
grow
not
an
hour
has
passed
that
i
have
not
thought
of
you
i
dreamed
of
you
you
have
been
my
only
joy
here
padre
damaso
himself
broke
out
into
tears
like
a
child
then
as
you
love
me
do
make
me
eternally
wretched
he
no
longer
lives
so
i
want
to
be
a
nun
the
old
priest
rested
his
forehead
on
his
hand
to
be
a
nun
a
nun
he
repeated
you
do
know
child
what
the
life
is
the
mystery
that
is
hidden
behind
the
walls
of
the
nunnery
you
know
a
thousand
times
would
i
prefer
to
see
you
unhappy
in
the
world
rather
than
in
the
cloister
here
your
complaints
can
be
heard
there
you
will
have
only
the
walls
you
are
beautiful
very
beautiful
and
you
were
not
born
for
that
to
be
a
bride
of
christ
believe
me
little
girl
time
will
wipe
away
everything
later
on
you
will
forget
you
will
love
you
will
love
your
husband
linares
the
nunnery
or
death

nunnery
the
nunnery
or
death
exclaimed
padre
damaso
maria
i
am
now
an
old
man
i
shall
not
be

high
up
on
the
slope
of
the
mountain
near
a
roaring
stream
a
hut
built
on

laden
with

and

adorn
this

home
where

a
tagalog
family
engaged
in
hunting
and
cutting
firewood
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
the
grandsire
was
making
brooms
from
the
fibers
of
palm
leaves
while
a
young
woman
was
placing
eggs
limes
and
some
vegetables
in
a
wide
basket
two
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
were
playing
by
the
side
of
another
who
pale
and
sad
with
large
eyes
and
a
deep
gaze
was
seated
on
a
fallen
in
his
thinned
features

recognize
sisa

at
the
sore
on
his
foot
and
then
turned
his
gaze
toward
the
sun
which
shone
resplendently

surprise
a
christmas
gift
a
son
the
old
man
felt
the
tears
springing
up
into
his
eyes
so
placing
his
hands
on
the
boy
head
he
said
with
emotion

old

robbers

boom
boom

asked
the
little
girl

surely
there
nothing
any
more
fun
than
to
be
chased
and
hide
yourself
basilio
smiled
but
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
caught
up
his
staff
i
come
back
soon
he
answered
i
bring
my
little
brother
you
see
him
and
play
with
him
he
just
about
as
big
as
you
are
does
he
walk
lame
too
asked
the
little
girl
then
we
make
him
when
we
play
do
forget
us
the
old
man
said
to
him
take
this
dried
meat
as
a
present
to
your
mother
the
children
accompanied
him
to
the
bamboo
bridge
swung
over
the
noisy
course
of
the
stream
lucia
made
him
support
himself
on
her
arm
and
thus
they
disappeared
from
the
children
sight
basilio
walking
along
nimbly
in
spite
of
his
bandaged
leg
the
north
wind
whistled
by
making
the
inhabitants
of
san
diego
shiver
with
cold
it
was
christmas
eve
and
yet
the
town
was
wrapped
in
gloom
not
a
paper
lantern
hung
from
the
windows
nor
did
a
single
sound
in
the
houses
indicate
the
rejoicing
of
other
years
in
the
house
of
capitan
basilio
he
and
don
filipo
for
the
misfortunes
of
the
latter
had
made
them
friendly
were
standing
by
a
and
talking
while
at
another
were
sinang
her
cousin
victoria
and
the
beautiful
iday
looking
toward
the
street
the
waning
moon
began
to
shine
over
the
horizon
illumining
the
clouds
and
making
the
trees
and
houses
east
long
fantastic
shadows
yours
is
not
a
little
good
fortune
to
get
off
free
in
these
times
said
capitan
basilio
to
don
filipo
they
burned
your
books
yes
but
others
have
lost
more
a
woman
approached
the
grating
and
gazed
into
the
interior
her
eyes
glittered
her
features
were
emaciated
her
hair
loose
and
dishevelled
the
moonlight
gave
her
a
weird
aspect
sisal
exclaimed
don
filipo
in
surprise
then
turning
to
capitan
basilio
as
the
madwoman
ran
away
he
asked
was
she
in
the
house
of
a
physician
has
she
been
cured
capitan
basilio
smiled
bitterly
the
physician
was
afraid
they
would
accuse
him
of
being
a
friend
of
don
crisostomo
so
he
drove
her
from
his
house
now
she
wanders
about
again
as
crazy
as
ever
singing
harming
no
one
and
living
in
the
woods
what
else
has
happened
in
the
town
since
we
left
it
i
know
that
we
have
a
new
curate
and
another
alferez
these
are
terrible
times
humanity
is
retrograding
murmured
capitan
basilio
thinking
of
the
past
the
day
after
you
left
they
found
the
senior
sacristan
dead
hanging
from
a
rafter
in
his
own
house
padre
salvi
was
greatly
affected
by
his
death
and
took
possession
of
all
his
papers
ah
yes
the
old
sage
tasio
also
died
and
was
buried
in
the
chinese
cemetery
poor
old
man
sighed
don
filipo
what
became
of
his
books
they
were
burned
by
the
pious
who
thought
thus
to
please
god
i
was
unable
to
save
anything
not
even
cicero
works
the
gobernadorcillo
did
nothing
to
prevent
it
both
became
silent
at
that
moment
the
sad
and
melancholy
song
of
the
madwoman
was
heard
do
you
know
when
maria
clara
is
to
be
married
iday
asked
sinang
i
do
know
answered
the
latter
i
received
a
letter
from
her
but
have
opened
it
for
fear
of
finding
out
poor
crisostomo
they
say
that
if
it
were
not
for
linares
they
would
hang
capitan
tiago
so
what
was
maria
clara
going
to
do
observed
victoria
a
boy
limped
by
running
toward
the
plaza
whence
came
the
notes
of
sisa
song
it
was
basilio
who
had
found
his
home
deserted
and
in
ruins
after
many
inquiries
he
had
only
learned
that
his
mother
was
insane
and
wandering
about
the
town
of
crispin
not
a
word
basilio
choked
back
his
tears
stifled
any
expression
of
his
sorrow
and
without
resting
had
started
in
search
of
his
mother
on
reaching
the
town
he
was
just
asking
about
her
when
her
song
struck
his
ears
the
unhappy
boy
overcame
the
trembling
in
his
limbs
and
ran
to
throw
himself
into
his
mother
arms
the
madwoman
left
the
plaza
and
stopped
in
front
of
the
house
of
the
new
alferez
now
as
formerly
there
was
a
sentinel
before
the
door
and
a
woman
head
appeared
at
the
window
only
it
was
not
the
medusa
but
that
of
a
comely
young
woman
alferez
and
unfortunate
are
not
synonymous
terms
sisa
began
to
sing
before
the
house
with
her
gaze
fixed
on
the
moon
which
soared
majestically
in
the
blue
heavens
among
golden
clouds
basilio
saw
her
but
did
not
dare
to
approach
her
walking
back
and
forth
but
taking
care
not
to
get
near
the
barracks
he
waited
for
the
time
when
she
would
leave
that
place
the
young
woman
who
was
at
the
window
listening
attentively
to
the
madwoman
song
ordered
the
sentinel
to
bring
her
inside
but
when
sisa
saw
the
soldier
approach
her
and
heard
his
voice
she
was
filled
with
terror
and
took
to
flight
at
a
speed
of
which
only
a
demented
person
is
capable
basilio
fearing
to
lose
her
ran
after
her
forgetful
of
the
pains
in
his
feet
look
how
that
boy
chasing
the
madwoman
indignantly
exclaimed
a
woman
in
the
street
seeing
that
he
continued
to
pursue
her
she
picked
up
a
stone
and
threw
it
at
him
saying
take
that
it
a
pity
that
the
dog
is
tied
up
basilio
felt
a
blow
on
his
head
but
paid
no
attention
to
it
as
he
continued
running
dogs
barked
geese
cackled
several
windows
opened
to
let
out
curious
faces
but
quickly
closed
again
from
fear
of
another
night
of
terror
soon
they
were
outside
of
the
town
sisa
began
to
moderate
her
flight
but
still
a
great
distance
separated
her
from
her
pursuer
mother
he
called
to
her
when
he
caught
sight
of
her
scarcely
had
the
madwoman
heard
his
voice
when
she
again
took
to
flight
mother
it
i
cried
the
boy
in
desperation
but
the
madwoman
did
not
heed
him
so
he
followed
panting
they
had
now
passed
the
cultivated
fields
and
were
near
the
wood
basilio
saw
his
mother
enter
it
and
he
also
went
in
the
bushes
and
shrubs
the
thorny
vines
and
projecting
roots
of
trees
hindered
the
movements
of
both
the
son
followed
his
mother
shadowy
form
as
it
was
revealed
from
time
to
time
by
the
moonlight
that
penetrated
through
the
foliage
and
into
the
open
spaces
they
were
in
the
mysterious
wood
of
the
ibarra
family
the
boy
stumbled
and
fell
several
times
but
rose
again
each
time
without
feeling
pain
all
his
soul
was
centered
in
his
eyes
following
the
beloved
figure
they
crossed
the
sweetly
murmuring
brook
where
sharp
thorns
of
bamboo
that
had
fallen
on
the
sand
at
its
margin
pierced
his
bare
feet
but
he
did
not
stop
to
pull
them
out
to
his
great
surprise
he
saw
that
his
mother
had
plunged
into
the
thick
undergrowth
and
was
going
through
the
wooden
gateway
that
opened
into
the
tomb
of
the
old
spaniard
at
the
foot
of
the
balete
basilio
tried
to
follow
her
in
but
found
the
gate
fastened
the
madwoman
defended
the
entrance
with
her
emaciated
arms
and
disheveled
head
holding
the
gate
shut
with
all
her
might
mother
it
i
it
i
i
basilio
your
son
cried
the
boy
as
he
let
himself
fall
weakly
but
the
madwoman
did
not
yield
bracing
herself
with
her
feet
on
the
ground
she
offered
an
energetic
resistance
basilio
beat
the
gate
with
his
fists
with
his
head
he
wept
but
in
vain
painfully
he
arose
and
examined
the
wall
thinking
to
scale
it
but
found
no
way
to
do
so
he
then
walked
around
it
and
noticed
that
a
branch
of
the
fateful
balete
was
crossed
with
one
from
another
tree
this
he
climbed
and
his
filial
love
working
miracles
made
his
way
from
branch
to
branch
to
the
balete
from
which
he
saw
his
mother
still
holding
the
gate
shut
with
her
head
the
noise
made
by
him
among
the
branches
attracted
attention
she
turned
and
tried
to
run
but
her
son
letting
himself
fall
from
the
tree
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
covered
her
with
kisses
losing
consciousness
as
he
did
so
sisa
saw
his
forehead
and
bent
over
him
her
eyes
seemed
to
start
from
their
sockets
as
she
peered
into
his
face
those
pale
features
stirred
the
sleeping
cells
of
her
brain
so
that
something
like
a
spark
of
intelligence
flashed
up
in
her
mind
and
she
recognized
her
son
with
a
terrible
cry
she
fell
upon
the
insensible
body
of
the
boy
embracing
and
kissing
him
mother
and
son
remained
motionless
when
basilio
recovered
consciousness
he
found
his
mother
lifeless
he
called
to
her
with
the
tenderest
names
but
she
did
not
awake
noticing
that
she
was
not
even
breathing
he
arose
and
went
to
the
neighboring
brook
to
get
some
water
in
a
banana
leaf
with
which
to
rub
the
pallid
face
of
his
mother
but
the
madwoman
made
not
the
least
movement
and
her
eyes
remained
closed
basilio
gazed
at
her
in
terror
he
placed
his
ear
over
her
heart
but
the
thin
faded
breast
was
cold
and
her
heart
no
longer
beat
he
put
his
lips
to
hers
but
felt
no
breathing
the
miserable
boy
threw
his
arms
about
the
corpse
and
wept
bitterly
the
moon
gleamed
majestically
in
the
sky
the
wandering
breezes
sighed
and
down
in
the
grass
the
crickets
chirped
the
night
of
light
and
joy
for
so
many
children
who
in
the
warm
bosom
of
the
family
celebrate
this
feast
of
sweetest
memories
the
feast
which
commemorates
the
first
look
of
love
that
heaven
sent
to
earth
this
night
when
in
all
christian
families
they
eat
drink
dance
sing
laugh
play
caress
and
kiss
one
another
this
night
which
in
cold
countries
holds
such
magic
for
childhood
with
its
traditional
covered
with
lights
dolls
candies
and
tinsel
whereon
gaze
the
round
staring
eyes
in
which
innocence
alone
is
reflected
this
night
brought
to
basilio
only
orphanhood
who
knows
but
that
perhaps
in
the
home
whence
came
the
taciturn
padre
salvi
children
also
played
perhaps
they
sang
la
nochebuena
se
viene
la
nochebuena
se
for
a
long
time
the
boy
wept
and
moaned
when
at
last
he
raised
his
head
he
saw
a
man
standing
over
him
gazing
at
the
scene
in
silence
are
you
her
son
asked
the
unknown
in
a
low
voice
the
boy
nodded
what
do
you
expect
to
do
bury
her
in
the
cemetery
i
have
any
money
and
besides
the
curate
would
allow
it
then
if
you
would
help
me
i
very
weak
answered
the
unknown
as
he
sank
slowly
to
the
ground
supporting
himself
with
both
hands
i
wounded
for
two
days
i
have
eaten
or
slept
has
no
one
come
here
tonight
the
man
thoughtfully
contemplated
the
attractive
features
of
the
boy
then
went
on
in
a
still
weaker
voice
listen
i
too
shall
be
dead
before
the
day
comes
twenty
paces
from
here
on
the
other
side
of
the
brook
there
is
a
big
pile
of
firewood
bring
it
here
make
a
pyre
put
our
bodies
upon
it
cover
them
over
and
set
fire
to
the
whole
fire
until
we
are
reduced
to
ashes
basilio
listened
attentively
afterwards
if
no
one
comes
dig
here
you
will
find
a
lot
of
gold
and
it
will
all
be
yours
take
it
and
go
to
school
the
voice
of
the
unknown
was
becoming
every
moment
more
unintelligible
go
get
the
firewood
i
want
to
help
you
as
basilio
moved
away
the
unknown
turned
his
face
toward
the
east
and
murmured
as
though
praying
i
die
without
seeing
the
dawn
brighten
over
my
native
land
you
who
have
it
to
see
welcome
it
and
forget
not
those
who
have
fallen
during
the
night
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
sky
and
his
lips
continued
to
move
as
if
uttering
a
prayer
then
he
bowed
his
head
and
sank
slowly
to
the
earth
two
hours
later
sister
rufa
was
on
the
back
veranda
of
her
house
making
her
morning
ablutions
in
order
to
attend
mass
the
pious
woman
gazed
at
the
adjacent
wood
and
saw
a
thick
column
of
smoke
rising
from
it
filled
with
holy
indignation
she
knitted
her
eyebrows
and
exclaimed
what
heretic
is
making
a
clearing
on
a
holy
day
that
why
so
many
calamities
come
you
ought
to
go
to
purgatory
and
see
if
you
could
get
out
of
there
savage
epilogue
since
some
of
our
characters
are
still
living
and
others
have
been
lost
sight
of
a
real
epilogue
is
impossible
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
groundlings
we
should
gladly
kill
off
all
of
them
beginning
with
padre
salvi
and
ending
with
doña
victorina
but
this
is
not
possible
let
them
live
anyhow
the
country
not
ourselves
has
to
support
them
after
maria
clara
entered
the
nunnery
padre
damaso
left
his
town
to
live
in
manila
as
did
also
padre
salvi
who
while
he
awaits
a
vacant
miter
preaches
sometimes
in
the
church
of
clara
in
whose
nunnery
he
discharges
the
duties
of
an
important
office
not
many
months
had
passed
when
padre
damaso
received
an
order
from
the
very
reverend
father
provincial
to
occupy
a
curacy
in
a
remote
province
it
is
related
that
he
was
so
grievously
affected
by
this
that
on
the
following
day
he
was
found
dead
in
his
bedchamber
some
said
that
he
had
died
of
an
apoplectic
stroke
others
of
a
nightmare
but
his
physician
dissipated
all
doubts
by
declaring
that
he
had
died
suddenly
none
of
our
readers
would
now
recognize
capitan
tiago
weeks
before
maria
clara
took
the
vows
he
fell
into
a
state
of
depression
so
great
that
he
grew
sad
and
thin
and
became
pensive
and
distrustful
like
his
former
friend
capitan
tinong
as
soon
as
the
doors
of
the
nunnery
closed
he
ordered
his
disconsolate
cousin
aunt
isabel
to
collect
whatever
had
belonged
to
his
daughter
and
his
dead
wife
and
to
go
to
make
her
home
in
malabon
or
san
diego
since
he
wished
to
live
alone
thenceforward
tie
then
devoted
himself
passionately
to
and
the
cockpit
and
began
to
smoke
opium
he
no
longer
goes
to
antipolo
nor
does
he
order
any
more
masses
so
doña
patrocinia
his
old
rival
celebrates
her
triumph
piously
by
snoring
during
the
sermons
if
at
any
time
during
the
late
afternoon
you
should
walk
along
calle
santo
cristo
you
would
see
seated
in
a
chinese
shop
a
small
man
yellow
thin
and
bent
with
stained
and
dirty
finger
nails
gazing
through
dreamy
sunken
eyes
at
the
as
if
he
did
not
see
them
at
nightfall
you
would
see
him
rise
with
difficulty
and
supporting
himself
on
his
cane
make
his
way
to
a
narrow
little
to
enter
a
grimy
building
over
the
door
of
which
may
be
seen
in
large
red
letters
fumadero
publico
de
anfion
this
is
that
capitan
tiago
who
was
so
celebrated
but
who
is
now
completely
forgotten
even
by
the
very
senior
sacristan
himself
doña
victorina
has
added
to
her
false
frizzes
and
to
her
if
we
may
be
permitted
the
term
the
new
custom
of
driving
the
carriage
horses
herself
obliging
don
tiburcio
to
remain
quiet
since
many
unfortunate
accidents
occurred
on
account
of
the
weakness
of
her
eyes
she
has
taken
to
wearing
spectacles
which
give
her
a
marvelous
appearance
the
doctor
has
never
been
called
upon
again
to
attend
any
one
and
the
servants
see
him
many
days
in
the
week
without
teeth
which
as
our
readers
know
is
a
very
bad
sign
linares
the
only
defender
of
the
hapless
doctor
has
long
been
at
rest
in
paco
cemetery
the
victim
of
dysentery
and
the
harsh
treatment
of
his
the
victorious
alferez
returned
to
spain
a
major
leaving
his
amiable
spouse
in
her
flannel
camisa
the
color
of
which
is
now
indescribable
the
poor
ariadne
finding
herself
thus
abandoned
also
devoted
herself
as
did
the
daughter
of
minos
to
the
cult
of
bacchus
and
the
cultivation
of
tobacco
she
drinks
and
smokes
with
such
fury
that
now
not
only
the
girls
but
even
the
old
women
and
little
children
fear
her
probably
our
acquaintances
of
the
town
of
san
diego
are
still
alive
if
they
did
not
perish
in
the
explosion
of
the
steamer
which
was
making
a
trip
to
the
province
since
no
one
bothered
himself
to
learn
who
the
unfortunates
were
that
perished
in
that
catastrophe
or
to
whom
belonged
the
legs
and
arms
left
neglected
on
convalescence
island
and
the
banks
of
the
river
we
have
no
idea
whether
any
acquaintance
of
our
readers
was
among
them
or
not
along
with
the
government
and
the
press
at
the
time
we
are
satisfied
with
the
information
that
the
only
friar
who
was
on
the
steamer
was
saved
and
we
do
not
ask
for
more
the
principal
thing
for
us
is
the
existence
of
the
virtuous
priests
whose
reign
in
the
philippines
may
god
conserve
for
the
good
of
our
souls
of
maria
clara
nothing
more
is
known
except
that
the
sepulcher
seems
to
guard
her
in
its
bosom
we
have
asked
several
persons
of
great
influence
in
the
holy
nunnery
of
clara
but
no
one
has
been
willing
to
tell
us
a
single
word
not
even
the
talkative
devotees
who
receive
the
famous
fried
and
the
even
more
famous
sauce
known
as
that
of
the
nuns
prepared
by
the
intelligent
cook
of
the
virgins
of
the
lord
nevertheless
on
a
night
in
september
the
hurricane
raged
over
manila
lashing
the
buildings
with
its
gigantic
wings
the
thunder
crashed
continuously
lightning
flashes
momentarily
revealed
the
havoc
wrought
by
the
blast
and
threw
the
inhabitants
into
wild
terror
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
each
flash
of
the
forked
lightning
showed
a
piece
of
roofing
or
a
flying
through
the
air
to
fall
with
a
horrible
crash
not
a
person
or
a
carriage
moved
through
the
streets
when
the
hoarse
reverberations
of
the
thunder
a
hundred
times
lost
themselves
in
the
distance
there
was
heard
the
soughing
of
the
wind
as
it
drove
the
raindrops
with
a
continuous
against
the
of
the
closed
windows
two
patrolmen
sheltered
themselves
under
the
eaves
of
a
building
near
the
nunnery
one
a
private
and
the
other
a
what
the
use
of
our
staying
here
said
the
private
no
one
is
moving
about
the
streets
we
ought
to
get
into
a
house
my
lives
in
calle
arzobispo
from
here
over
there
is
quite
a
distance
and
we
get
wet
answered
the
what
does
that
matter
just
so
the
lightning
does
strike
us
bah
do
worry
the
nuns
surely
have
a
lightningrod
to
protect
them
yes
observed
the
private
but
of
what
use
is
it
when
the
night
is
so
dark
as
he
said
this
he
looked
upward
to
stare
into
the
darkness
at
that
moment
a
prolonged
streak
of
lightning
flashed
followed
by
a
terrific
roar
susmariosep
exclaimed
the
private
crossing
himself
and
catching
hold
of
his
companion
let
get
away
from
here
what
happened
come
come
away
from
here
he
repeated
with
his
teeth
rattling
from
fear
what
have
you
seen
a
specter
he
murmured
trembling
with
fright
a
specter
on
the
roof
there
it
must
be
the
nun
who
practises
magic
during
the
night
the
thrust
his
head
out
to
look
just
as
a
flash
of
lightning
furrowed
the
heavens
with
a
vein
of
fire
and
sent
a
horrible
crash
earthwards
he
exclaimed
also
crossing
himself
in
the
brilliant
glare
of
the
celestial
light
he
had
seen
a
white
figure
standing
almost
on
the
ridge
of
the
roof
with
arms
and
face
raised
toward
the
sky
as
if
praying
to
it
the
heavens
responded
with
lightning
and
thunderbolts
as
the
sound
of
the
thunder
rolled
away
a
sad
plaint
was
heard
that
not
the
wind
it
the
specter
murmured
the
private
as
if
in
response
to
the
pressure
of
his
companion
hand
ay
ay
came
through
the
air
rising
above
the
noise
of
the
rain
nor
could
the
whistling
wind
drown
that
sweet
and
mournful
voice
charged
with
affliction
again
the
lightning
flashed
with
dazzling
intensity
no
it
not
a
specter
exclaimed
the
i
seen
her
before
she
beautiful
like
the
virgin
let
get
away
from
here
and
report
it
the
private
did
not
wait
for
him
to
repeat
the
invitation
and
both
disappeared
who
was
moaning
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
spite
of
the
wind
and
rain
and
storm
who
was
the
timid
maiden
the
bride
of
christ
who
defied
the
unchained
elements
and
chose
such
a
fearful
night
under
the
open
sky
to
breathe
forth
from
so
perilous
a
height
her
complaints
to
god
had
the
lord
abandoned
his
altar
in
the
nunnery
so
that
he
no
longer
heard
her
supplications
did
its
arches
perhaps
prevent
the
longings
of
the
soul
from
rising
up
to
the
throne
of
the
most
merciful
the
tempest
raged
furiously
nearly
the
whole
night
nor
did
a
single
star
shine
through
the
darkness
the
despairing
plaints
continued
to
mingle
with
the
soughing
of
the
wind
but
they
found
nature
and
man
alike
deaf
god
had
hidden
himself
and
heard
not
on
the
following
day
after
the
dark
clouds
had
cleared
away
and
the
sun
shone
again
brightly
in
the
limpid
sky
there
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
nunnery
of
clara
a
carriage
from
which
alighted
a
man
who
made
himself
known
as
a
representative
of
the
authorities
he
asked
to
be
allowed
to
speak
immediately
with
the
abbess
and
to
see
all
the
nuns
it
is
said
that
one
of
these
who
appeared
in
a
gown
all
wet
and
torn
with
tears
and
tales
of
horror
begged
the
man
protection
against
the
outrages
of
hypocrisy
it
is
also
said
that
she
was
very
beautiful
and
had
the
most
lovely
and
expressive
eyes
that
were
ever
seen
the
representative
of
the
authorities
did
not
accede
to
her
request
but
after
talking
with
the
abbess
left
her
there
in
spite
of
her
tears
and
pleadings
the
youthful
nun
saw
the
door
close
behind
him
as
a
condemned
person
might
look
upon
the
portals
of
heaven
closing
against
him
if
ever
heaven
should
come
to
be
as
cruel
and
unfeeling
as
men
are
the
abbess
said
that
she
was
a
madwoman
the
man
may
not
have
known
that
there
is
in
manila
a
home
for
the
demented
or
perhaps
he
looked
upon
the
nunnery
itself
as
an
insane
asylum
although
it
is
claimed
that
he
was
quite
ignorant
especially
in
a
matter
of
deciding
whether
a
person
is
of
sound
mind
it
is
also
reported
that
general
j
thought
otherwise
when
the
matter
reached
his
ears
he
wished
to
protect
the
madwoman
and
asked
for
her
but
this
time
no
beautiful
and
unprotected
maiden
appeared
nor
would
the
abbess
permit
a
visit
to
the
cloister
forbidding
it
in
the
name
of
religion
and
the
holy
statutes

contemptuously
hostile
to

who
has

a
spectacular
demonstration
of
waving
a
red
light
after
the
wreck
having
become
his
most
enthusiastic
almost
hysterical
biographer
rizal
is
what
is
commonly
called
a
character
but
he
has
repeatedly
demonstrated
very
great
inexperience
in
the
affairs
of
life
i
believe
him
to
be
now
about
years
old
he
is
the
indian
of
most
ability
among
those
who
have
written
from
valenzuela

september
sixth
the
spanish
practise
is
to
place
a
condemned
person
for
the
hours
preceding
his
execution
in
a
or
a
cell
fitted
up
as
such
where
he
may
devote
himself
to
religious
exercises
and
receive
the
final
ministrations
of
the
church
but
even
this
conclusion
is
open
to
doubt
there
is
no
proof
beyond
the
unsupported
statement
of
the
jesuits
that
he
made
a
written
retraction
which
was
later
destroyed
though
why
a
document
so
interesting
and
so
important
in
support
of
their
own
point
of
view
should
not
have
been
preserved
furnishes
an
illuminating
commentary
on
the
whole
confused
affair
the
only
unofficial
witness
present
was
the
condemned
man
sister
and
her
declaration
that
she
was
at
the
time
in
such
a
state
of
excitement
and
distress
that
she
is
unable
to
affirm
positively
that
there
was
a
real
marriage
ceremony
performed
can
readily
be
accepted
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
jesuits
were
themselves
under
the
official
and
popular
ban
for
the
part
they
had
played
in
rizal
education
and
development
and
that
they
were
seeking
to
set
themselves
right
in
order
to
maintain
their
prestige
add
to
this
the
persistent
and
systematic
effort
made
to
destroy
every
scrap
of
record
relating
to
the
man
the
sole
gleam
of
shame
evidenced
in
the
impolitic
idiotic
and
pusillanimous
treatment
of
him
and
the
whole
question
becomes
such
a
puzzle
that
it
may
just
as
well
be
left
in
darkness

a
throb
of
pity
for
the
unfortunate

claim

comes
from

letter
written

the
character

habits
of
the
indian
inhabitants
of
these

a
letter
which
was
widely
circulated
and
which
has
been
extensively
used
by
other
writers
in

the
writer
with
senile
querulousness
harped
up

down
the
whole
gamut
of
abuse
in
describing
and
commenting
upon
the
vices
of
the
natives
very
artlessly
revealing
the
fact
in

places

that
his
observations
were
drawn
principally
from
the
conduct
of
the
servants
in

conventos
and
homes
of

to
him

letter
is

credit
of
giving
its
wide
popularity
to
the
specious
couplet

rattan
thrives
donde
el

nace
where
the
indian
lives
which
the
holy
men
who
delighted
in
quoting
it
took
as
an
additional
evidence
of
the
wise
dispensation
of
the
god
of
nature
rather
inconsistently
overlooking
its
incongruity
with
the
teachings
of
him
in
whose
name
they
assumed
their
holy
office
it
seems
somewhat
strange
that
a
spiritual
father
should
have
written
in
such
terms
about
his
charges
until
the
fact
appears
that
the
letter
was
addressed
to
an
influential
friend
in
spain
for
use
in
opposition
to
a
proposal
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of

of

parishes
