preface
we
may
believe
in
the
doctrine
of
progress
or
we
may
not
but
in
either
case
it
is
a
matter
of
interest
to
examine
the
origins
and
trace
the
history
of
what
is
now
even
should
it
ultimately
prove
to
be
no
more
than
an
idolum
saeculi
the
animating
and
controlling
idea
of
western
civilisation
for
the
earthly
progress
of
humanity
is
the
general
test
to
which
social
aims
and
theories
are
submitted
as
a
matter
of
course
the
phrase
civilisation
and
progress
has
become
stereotyped
and
illustrates
how
we
have
come
to
judge
a
civilisation
good
or
bad
according
as
it
is
or
is
not
progressive
the
ideals
of
liberty
and
democracy
which
have
their
own
ancient
and
independent
justifications
have
sought
a
new
strength
by
attaching
themselves
to
progress
the
conjunctions
of
liberty
and
progress
democracy
and
progress
meet
us
at
every
turn
socialism
at
an
early
stage
of
its
modern
development
sought
the
same
aid
the
friends
of
mars
who
can
not
bear
the
prospect
of
perpetual
peace
maintain
that
war
is
an
indispensable
instrument
of
progress
it
is
in
the
name
of
progress
that
the
doctrinaires
who
established
the
present
reign
of
terror
in
russia
profess
to
act
all
this
shows
the
prevalent
feeling
that
a
social
or
political
theory
or
programme
is
hardly
tenable
if
it
can
not
claim
that
it
harmonises
with
this
controlling
idea
in
the
middle
ages
europeans
followed
a
different
guiding
star
the
idea
of
a
life
beyond
the
grave
was
in
control
and
the
great
things
of
this
life
were
conducted
with
reference
to
the
next
when
men
deepest
feelings
reacted
more
steadily
and
powerfully
to
the
idea
of
saving
their
souls
than
to
any
other
harmony
with
this
idea
was
the
test
by
which
the
opportuneness
of
social
theories
and
institutions
was
judged
monasticism
for
instance
throve
under
its
aegis
while
liberty
of
conscience
had
no
chance
with
a
new
idea
in
control
this
has
been
reversed
religious
freedom
has
thriven
under
the
aegis
of
progress
monasticism
can
make
no
appeal
to
it
for
the
hope
of
an
ultimate
happy
state
on
this
planet
to
be
enjoyed
by
future
generations
or
of
some
state
at
least
that
may
relatively
be
considered
happy
has
replaced
as
a
social
power
the
hope
of
felicity
in
another
world
belief
in
personal
immortality
is
still
very
widely
entertained
but
may
we
not
fairly
say
that
it
has
ceased
to
be
a
central
and
guiding
idea
of
collective
life
a
criterion
by
which
social
values
are
measured
many
people
do
not
believe
in
it
many
more
regard
it
as
so
uncertain
that
they
could
not
reasonably
permit
it
to
affect
their
lives
or
opinions
those
who
believe
in
it
are
doubtless
the
majority
but
belief
has
many
degrees
and
one
can
hardly
be
wrong
in
saying
that
as
a
general
rule
this
belief
does
not
possess
the
imaginations
of
those
who
hold
it
that
their
emotions
react
to
it
feebly
that
it
is
felt
to
be
remote
and
unreal
and
has
comparatively
seldom
a
more
direct
influence
on
conduct
than
the
abstract
arguments
to
be
found
in
treatises
on
morals
under
the
control
of
the
idea
of
progress
the
ethical
code
recognised
in
the
western
world
has
been
reformed
in
modern
times
by
a
new
principle
of
importance
which
has
emanated
from
that
idea
when
isocrates
formulated
the
rule
of
life
do
unto
others
he
probably
did
not
mean
to
include
among
others
slaves
or
savages
the
stoics
and
the
christians
extended
its
application
to
the
whole
of
living
humanity
but
in
late
years
the
rule
has
received
a
vastly
greater
extension
by
the
inclusion
of
the
unborn
generations
of
the
future
this
principle
of
duty
to
posterity
is
a
direct
corollary
of
the
idea
of
progress
in
the
recent
war
that
idea
involving
the
moral
obligation
of
making
sacrifices
for
the
sake
of
future
ages
was
constantly
appealed
to
just
as
in
the
crusades
the
most
characteristic
wars
of
our
medieval
ancestors
the
idea
of
human
destinies
then
in
the
ascendant
lured
thousands
to
hardship
and
death
the
present
attempt
to
trace
the
genesis
and
growth
of
the
idea
in
broad
outline
is
a
purely
historical
inquiry
and
any
discussion
of
the
great
issue
which
is
involved
lies
outside
its
modest
scope
occasional
criticisms
on
particular
forms
which
the
creed
of
progress
assumed
or
on
arguments
which
were
used
to
support
it
are
not
intended
as
a
judgment
on
its
general
validity
i
may
however
make
two
observations
here
the
doubts
which
balfour
expressed
nearly
thirty
years
ago
in
an
address
delivered
at
glasgow
have
not
so
far
as
i
know
been
answered
and
it
is
probable
that
many
people
to
whom
six
years
ago
the
notion
of
a
sudden
decline
or
of
our
western
civilisation
as
a
result
not
of
cosmic
forces
but
of
its
own
development
would
have
appeared
almost
fantastic
will
feel
much
less
confident
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
leading
nations
of
the
world
have
instituted
a
league
of
peoples
for
the
prevention
of
war
the
measure
to
which
so
many
high
priests
of
progress
have
looked
forward
as
meaning
a
long
stride
forward
on
the
road
to
utopia
the
preponderance
of
france
part
in
developing
the
idea
is
an
outstanding
feature
of
its
history
france
who
like
ancient
greece
has
always
been
a
of
ideas
bears
the
principal
responsibility
for
its
growth
and
if
it
is
french
thought
that
will
persistently
claim
our
attention
this
is
not
due
to
an
arbitrary
preference
on
my
part
or
to
neglect
of
speculation
in
other
countries

introduction
when
we
say
that
ideas
rule
the
world
or
exercise
a
decisive
power
in
history
we
are
generally
thinking
of
those
ideas
which
express
human
aims
and
depend
for
their
realisation
on
the
human
will
such
as
liberty
toleration
equality
of
opportunity
socialism
some
of
these
have
been
partly
realised
and
there
is
no
reason
why
any
of
them
should
not
be
fully
realised
in
a
society
or
in
the
world
if
it
were
the
united
purpose
of
a
society
or
of
the
world
to
realise
it
they
are
approved
or
condemned
because
they
are
held
to
be
good
or
bad
not
because
they
are
true
or
false
but
there
is
another
order
of
ideas
that
play
a
great
part
in
determining
and
directing
the
course
of
conduct
but
do
not
depend
on
his
will
ideas
which
bear
upon
the
mystery
of
life
such
as
fate
providence
or
personal
immortality
such
ideas
may
operate
in
important
ways
on
the
forms
of
social
action
but
they
involve
a
question
of
fact
and
they
are
accepted
or
rejected
not
because
they
are
believed
to
be
useful
or
injurious
but
because
they
are
believed
to
be
true
or
false
the
idea
of
the
progress
of
humanity
is
an
idea
of
this
kind
and
it
is
important
to
be
quite
clear
on
the
point
we
now
take
it
so
much
for
granted
we
are
so
conscious
of
constantly
progressing
in
knowledge
arts
organising
capacity
utilities
of
all
sorts
that
it
is
easy
to
look
upon
progress
as
an
aim
like
liberty
or
a
which
it
only
depends
on
our
own
efforts
and
to
achieve
but
though
all
increases
of
power
and
knowledge
depend
on
human
effort
the
idea
of
the
progress
of
humanity
from
which
all
these
particular
progresses
derive
their
value
raises
a
definite
question
of
fact
which
wishes
or
labours
can
not
affect
any
more
than
his
wishes
or
labours
can
prolong
life
beyond
the
grave
this
idea
means
that
civilisation
has
moved
is
moving
and
will
move
in
a
desirable
direction
but
in
order
to
judge
that
we
are
moving
in
a
desirable
direction
we
should
have
to
know
precisely
what
the
destination
is
to
the
minds
of
most
people
the
desirable
outcome
of
human
development
would
be
a
condition
of
society
in
which
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
planet
would
enjoy
a
perfectly
happy
existence
but
it
is
impossible
to
be
sure
that
civilisation
is
moving
in
the
right
direction
to
realise
this
aim
certain
features
of
our
progress
may
be
urged
as
presumptions
in
its
favour
but
there
are
always
offsets
and
it
has
always
been
easy
to
make
out
a
case
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
increasing
happiness
the
tendencies
of
our
progressive
civilisation
are
far
from
desirable
in
short
it
can
not
be
proved
that
the
unknown
destination
towards
which
man
is
advancing
is
desirable
the
movement
may
be
progress
or
it
may
be
in
an
undesirable
direction
and
therefore
not
progress
this
is
a
question
of
fact
and
one
which
is
at
present
as
insoluble
as
the
question
of
personal
immortality
it
is
a
problem
which
bears
on
the
mystery
of
life
moreover
even
if
it
is
admitted
to
be
probable
that
the
course
of
civilisation
has
so
far
been
in
a
desirable
direction
and
such
as
would
lead
to
general
felicity
if
the
direction
were
followed
far
enough
it
can
not
be
proved
that
ultimate
attainment
depends
entirely
on
the
human
will
for
the
advance
might
at
some
point
be
arrested
by
an
insuperable
wall
take
the
particular
case
of
knowledge
as
to
which
it
is
generally
taken
for
granted
that
the
continuity
of
progress
in
the
future
depends
altogether
on
the
continuity
of
human
effort
assuming
that
human
brains
do
not
degenerate
this
assumption
is
based
on
a
strictly
limited
experience
science
has
been
advancing
without
interruption
during
the
last
three
or
four
hundred
years
every
new
discovery
has
led
to
new
problems
and
new
methods
of
solution
and
opened
up
new
fields
for
exploration
hitherto
men
of
science
have
not
been
compelled
to
halt
they
have
always
found
means
to
advance
further
but
what
assurance
have
we
that
they
will
not
one
day
come
up
against
impassable
barriers
the
experience
of
four
hundred
years
in
which
the
surface
of
nature
has
been
successfully
tapped
can
hardly
be
said
to
warrant
conclusions
as
to
the
prospect
of
operations
extending
over
four
hundred
or
four
thousand
centuries
take
biology
or
astronomy
how
can
we
be
sure
that
some
day
progress
may
not
come
to
a
dead
pause
not
because
knowledge
is
exhausted
but
because
our
resources
for
investigation
are
exhausted
because
for
instance
scientific
instruments
have
reached
the
limit
of
perfection
beyond
which
it
is
demonstrably
impossible
to
improve
them
or
because
in
the
case
of
astronomy
we
come
into
the
presence
of
forces
of
which
unlike
gravitation
we
have
no
terrestrial
experience
it
is
an
assumption
which
can
not
be
verified
that
we
shall
not
soon
reach
a
point
in
our
knowledge
of
nature
beyond
which
the
human
intellect
is
unqualified
to
pass
but
it
is
just
this
assumption
which
is
the
light
and
inspiration
of
man
scientific
research
for
if
the
assumption
is
not
true
it
means
that
he
can
never
come
within
sight
of
the
goal
which
is
in
the
case
of
physical
science
if
not
a
complete
knowledge
of
the
cosmos
and
the
processes
of
nature
at
least
an
immeasurably
larger
and
deeper
knowledge
than
we
at
present
possess
thus
continuous
progress
in
man
knowledge
of
his
environment
which
is
one
of
the
chief
conditions
of
general
progress
is
a
hypothesis
which
may
or
may
not
be
true
and
if
it
is
true
there
remains
the
further
hypothesis
of
man
moral
and
social
perfectibility
which
rests
on
much
less
impressive
evidence
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
he
may
not
reach
in
his
psychical
and
social
development
a
stage
at
which
the
conditions
of
his
life
will
be
still
far
from
satisfactory
and
beyond
which
he
will
find
it
impossible
to
progress
this
is
a
question
of
fact
which
no
willing
on
man
part
can
alter
it
is
a
question
bearing
on
the
mystery
of
life
enough
has
been
said
to
show
that
the
progress
of
humanity
belongs
to
the
same
order
of
ideas
as
providence
or
personal
immortality
it
is
true
or
it
is
false
and
like
them
it
can
not
be
proved
either
true
or
false
belief
in
it
is
an
act
of
faith
the
idea
of
human
progress
then
is
a
theory
which
involves
a
synthesis
of
the
past
and
a
prophecy
of
the
future
it
is
based
on
an
interpretation
of
history
which
regards
men
as
slowly
advancing
pedetemtim
progredientes
in
a
definite
and
desirable
direction
and
infers
that
this
progress
will
continue
indefinitely
and
it
implies
that
as
the
issue
of
the
earth
great
business
a
condition
of
general
happiness
will
ultimately
be
enjoyed
which
will
justify
the
whole
process
of
civilisation
for
otherwise
the
direction
would
not
be
desirable
there
is
also
a
further
implication
the
process
must
be
the
necessary
outcome
of
the
psychical
and
social
nature
of
man
it
must
not
be
at
the
mercy
of
any
external
will
otherwise
there
would
be
no
guarantee
of
its
continuance
and
its
issue
and
the
idea
of
progress
would
lapse
into
the
idea
of
providence
as
time
is
the
very
condition
of
the
possibility
of
progress
it
is
obvious
that
the
idea
would
be
valueless
if
there
were
any
cogent
reasons
for
supposing
that
the
time
at
the
disposal
of
humanity
is
likely
to
reach
a
limit
in
the
near
future
if
there
were
good
cause
for
believing
that
the
earth
would
be
uninhabitable
in
or
the
doctrine
of
progress
would
lose
its
meaning
and
would
automatically
disappear
it
would
be
a
delicate
question
to
decide
what
is
the
minimum
period
of
time
which
must
be
assured
to
man
for
his
future
development
in
order
that
progress
should
possess
value
and
appeal
to
the
emotions
the
recorded
history
of
civilisation
covers
years
or
so
and
if
we
take
this
as
a
measure
of
our
conceptions
of
we
might
assume
that
if
we
were
sure
of
a
period
ten
times
as
long
ahead
of
us
the
idea
of
progress
would
not
lose
its
power
of
appeal
sixty
thousand
years
of
historical
time
when
we
survey
the
changes
which
have
come
to
pass
in
six
thousand
opens
to
the
imagination
a
range
vast
enough
to
seem
almost
endless
this
psychological
question
however
need
not
be
decided
for
science
assures
us
that
the
stability
of
the
present
conditions
of
the
solar
system
is
certified
for
many
myriads
of
years
to
come
whatever
gradual
modifications
of
climate
there
may
be
the
planet
will
not
cease
to
support
life
for
a
period
which
transcends
and
flouts
all
efforts
of
imagination
in
short
the
possibility
of
progress
is
guaranteed
by
the
high
probability
based
on
science
of
an
immense
time
to
progress
in
it
may
surprise
many
to
be
told
that
the
notion
of
progress
which
now
seems
so
easy
to
apprehend
is
of
comparatively
recent
origin
it
has
indeed
been
claimed
that
various
thinkers
both
ancient
for

seneca
and
medieval
for
instance

had
long
ago
conceived

some
future
additions

his
knowledge
of
nature
which
were
inevitable
at
a
certain
stage
of
human
reflection
do
not
amount
to
an
anticipation
of

the
value
of
such
observations
was
determined
and
must
be
estimated
by
the
whole
context
of
ideas
in
which
they
occurred
it
is
from
its
bearings
on
the
future
that
progress
derives
its
value
its
interest
and
its
power
you
may
conceive
civilisation
as
having
gradually
advanced
in
the
past
but
you
have
not
got
the
idea
of
progress
until
you
go
on
to
conceive
that
it
is
destined
to
advance
indefinitely
in
the
future
ideas
have
their
intellectual
climates
and
i
propose
to
show
briefly
in
this
introduction
that
the
intellectual
climates
of
classical
antiquity
and
the
ensuing
ages
were
not
propitious
to
the
birth
of
the
doctrine
of
progress
it
is
not
till
the
sixteenth
century
that
the
obstacles
to
its
appearance
definitely
begin
to
be
transcended
and
a
favourable
atmosphere
to
be
gradually
prepared

the
history

down

his

is
planned
on
a
large
scale
he
is
erudite
and
has
read
extensively
but
his
treatment
is
lacking
in
the
power
of
discrimination
he
strikes
one
as
anxious

bring

as
many
distinguished

as
possible
and
so
along
with
a
great
deal
that
is
useful
and
relevant
we
also
find
in
his
book
much
that
is
irrelevant
he
has
not
clearly
seen
that
the
distinctive
idea
of
progress
was
not
conceived
in
antiquity
or
in
the
middle
ages
or
even
in
the
renaissance
period
and
when
he
comes
to
modern
times
he
fails
to
bring
out
clearly
the
decisive
steps
of
its
growth
and
he
does
not
seem
to
realise
that
a
man
might
be
progressive
without
believing
in
or
even
thinking
about
the
doctrine
of
progress
leonardo
da

and
berkeley
are
examples
in
my
ancient
greek
historians

dwelt
on
the
modern
origin
of
the
idea
recently
murray
in
a
learned
appendix
to
his
erasmus
and
luther
has
developed
the
thesis
that
progress
was
not
grasped
in
antiquity
though
he
makes
an
exception
of
seneca
a
welcome
confirmation
i
it
may
in
particular
seem
surprising
that
the
greeks
who
were
so
fertile
in
their
speculations
on
human
life
did
not
hit
upon
an
idea
which
seems
so
simple
and
obvious
to
us
as
the
idea
of
progress
but
if
we
try
to
realise
their
experience
and
the
general
character
of
their
thought
we
shall
cease
to
wonder
their
recorded
history
did
not
go
back
far
and
so
far
as
it
did
go
there
had
been
no
impressive
series
of
new
discoveries
suggesting
either
an
indefinite
increase
of
knowledge
or
a
growing
mastery
of
the
forces
of
nature
in
the
period
in
which
their
most
brilliant
minds
were
busied
with
the
problems
of
the
universe
men
might
improve
the
building
of
ships
or
invent
new
geometrical
demonstrations
but
their
science
did
little
or
nothing
to
transform
the
conditions
of
life
or
to
open
any
vista
into
the
future
they
were
in
the
presence
of
no
facts
strong
enough
to
counteract
that
profound
veneration
of
antiquity
which
seems
natural
to
mankind
and
the
athenians
of
the
age
of
pericles
or
of
plato
though
they
were
thoroughly
obviously
modern
compared
with
the
homeric
greeks
were
never
modern
as
we
are
the
indications
that
human
civilisation
was
a
gradual
growth
and
that
man
had
painfully
worked
his
way
forward
from
a
low
and
savage
state
could
not
indeed
escape
the
sharp
vision
of
the
greeks
for
instance
aeschylus
represents
men
as
originally
living
at
hazard
in
sunless
caves
and
raised
from
that
condition
by
prometheus
who
taught
them
the
arts
of
life
in
euripides
we
find
a
similar
recognition
of
the
ascent
of
mankind
to
a
civilised
state
from
primitive
barbarism
some
god
or
other
playing
the
part
of
prometheus
in
such
passages
as
these
we
have
it
may
be
said
the
idea
that
man
has
progressed
and
it
may
fairly
be
suggested
that
belief
in
a
natural
progress
lay
for
aeschylus
as
well
as
for
euripides
behind
the
poetical
fiction
of
supernatural
intervention
but
these
recognitions
of
a
progress
were
not
incompatible
with
the
belief
in
an
initial
degeneration
of
the
human
race
nor
did
it
usually
appear
as
a
rival
doctrine
the
old
legend
of
a
golden
age
of
simplicity
from
which
man
had
fallen
away
was
generally
accepted
as
truth
and
leading
thinkers
combined
it
with
the
doctrine
of
a
gradual
sequence
of
social
and
material
improvements

in
the
masterly
survey
of

greek
history
which
thucydides
prefixed
to
his
work
he
traces
the
social
progress
of
the
greeks
in
historical
times
and
finds
the
key
to
it
in
the
increase
of
wealth
during
the
subsequent
period

decline

find
the
two
views

combined

the
simple
life
of
the
first
age
in
which
men
were
not

with

regarded
as

such
ancient

not
suggest
the
guess

might
lead
ultimately
to
conditions
in
which
life
would
be
more
complex
but
as
happy
as
the
simple
life
of
the
primitive
world
but
if
some
relative
progress
might
be
admitted
the
general
view
of
greek
philosophers
was
that
they
were
living
in
a
period
of
inevitable
degeneration
and
decay
inevitable
because
it
was
prescribed
by
the
nature
of
the
universe
we
have
only
an
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
influential
speculations
of
heraclitus
pythagoras
and
empedocles
but
we
may
take
plato
tentative
philosophy
of
history
to
illustrate
the
trend
and
the
prejudices
of
greek
thought
on
this
subject
the
world
was
created
and
set
going
by
the
deity
and
as
his
work
it
was
perfect
but
it
was
not
immortal
and
had
in
it
the
seeds
of
decay
the
period
of
its
duration
is
solar
years
during
the
first
half
of
this
period
the
original
uniformity
and
order
which
were
impressed
upon
it
by
the
creator
are
maintained
under
his
guidance
but
then
it
reaches
a
point
from
which
it
begins
as
it
were
to
roll
back
the
deity
has
loosened
his
grip
of
the
machine
the
order
is
disturbed
and
the
second
years
are
a
period
of
gradual
decay
and
degeneration
at
the
end
of
this
time
the
world
left
to
itself
would
dissolve
into
chaos
but
the
deity
again
seizes
the
helm
and
restores
the
original
conditions
and
the
whole
process
begins
anew
the
first
half
of
such
a
corresponds
to
the
golden
age
of
legend
in
which
men
lived
happily
and
simply
we
have
now
unfortunately
reached
some
point
in
the
period

else
that
a

the

attributed
to

in

it
would
bring
to
the
general
community
of
mankind
he
did
not
expect
from
it
any
improvement
of
the
world
the
value
of
natural
science
from
his
point
of
view
was
this
that
it
opened
to
the
philosopher
a
divine
region
in
which
wandering
among
the
stars
he
could
laugh
at
the
earth
and
all
its
riches
and
his
mind
delivered
as
it
were
from
prison
could
return
to
its
original
home
in
other
words
its
value
lay
not
in
its
results
but
simply
in
the
intellectual
activity
and
therefore
it
concerned
not
mankind
at
large
but
a
few
chosen
individuals
who
doomed
to
live
in
a
miserable

there
was
however
a
school
of
philosophical
speculation
which

have

to
the
foundation
of
a
theory
of
progress
if
the
historical
outlook
of
the
greeks
had
been
larger
and
if
their
temper
had
been
different
the
atomic
theory
of
democritus
seems
to
us
now
in
many
ways
the
most
wonderful
achievement
of
greek
thought
but
it
had
a
small
range
of
influence
in
greece
and
would
have
had
less
if
it
had
not
convinced
the
brilliant
mind
of
epicurus
the
epicureans
developed
it
and
it
may
be
that
the
views
which
they
put
forward
as
to
the
history
of
the
human
race
are
mainly
their
own
superstructure
these
philosophers
rejected
entirely
the
doctrine
of
a
golden
age
and
a
subsequent
degeneration
which
was
manifestly
incompatible
with
their
theory
that
the
world
was
mechanically
formed
from
atoms
without
the
intervention
of
a
deity
for
them
the
earliest
condition
of
men
resembled
that
of
the
beasts
and
from
this
primitive
and
miserable
condition
they
laboriously
reached
the
existing
state
of
civilisation
not
by
external
guidance
or
as
a
consequence
of
some
initial
design
but
simply
by
the
exercise
of
human
intelligence

found
it

them
it
would

them
as

theory
of

this

was
connected
with
the

were
to
name
any

idea
as
generally
controlling

perhaps
be
moira

in

as
a
fact

it
had
enough
in

with

to
demand
a

to
hinder
the
creation
of

optimistic
atmosphere
of

it
was
this
order
which
kept
things
in

places
assigned
to
each
its

and
drew
a
definite

can

now
how
it
was
that
speculative
greek
minds
never
hit
on
the
idea

in
the
first
place
their
limited
historical
experience
did
not
easily
suggest
such
a
synthesis
and
in
the
second
place
the
axioms
of
their
thought
their
suspiciousness
of
change
their
theories
of
moira
of
degeneration
and
cycles
suggested
a
view
of
the
world
which
was
the
very
antithesis
of
progressive
development
epicurean
philosophers
made
indeed
what
might
have
been
an
important
step
in
the
direction
of
the
doctrine
of
progress
by
discarding
the
theory
of
degeneration
and
recognising
that
civilisation
had
been
created
by
a
series
of
successive
improvements
achieved
by
the
effort
of
man
alone
but
here
they
stopped
short
for
they
had
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
lot
of
the
individual
here
and
now
and
their
study
of
the
history
of
humanity
was
strictly
subordinate
to
this
personal
interest
the
value
of
their
recognition
of
human
progress
in
the
past
is
conditioned
by
the
general
tenor
and
purpose
of
their
theory
of
life
it
was
simply
one
item
in
their
demonstration
that
man
owed
nothing
to
supernatural
intervention
and
had
nothing
to
fear
from
supernatural
powers
it
is
however
no
accident
that
the
school
of
thought
which
struck
on
a
path
that
might
have
led
to
the
idea
of
progress
was
the
most
uncompromising
enemy
of
superstition
that
greece
produced
it
might
be
thought
that
the
establishment
of
roman
rule
and
order
in
a
large
part
of
the
known
world
and
the
civilising
of
barbarian
peoples
could
not
fail
to
have
opened
to
the
imagination
of
some
of
those
who
reflected
on
it
in
the
days
of
virgil
or
of
seneca
a
vista
into
the
future
but
there
was
no
change
in
the
conditions
of
life
likely
to
suggest
a
brighter
view
of
human
existence
with
the
loss
of
freedom
pessimism
increased
and
the
greek
philosophies
of
resignation
were
needed
more
than
ever
those
whom
they
could
not
satisfy
turned
their
thoughts
to
new
mystical
philosophies
and
religions
which
were
little
interested
in
the
earthly
destinies
of
human
society
ii
the
idea
of
the
universe
which
prevailed
throughout
the
middle
ages
and
the
general
orientation
of
men
thoughts
were
incompatible
with
some
of
the
fundamental
assumptions
which
are
required
by
the
idea
of
progress
according
to
the
christian
theory
which
was
worked
out
by
the
fathers
and
especially
by
augustine
the
whole
movement
of
history
has
the
purpose
of
securing
the
happiness
of
a
small
portion
of
the
human
race
in
another
world
it
does
not
postulate
a
further
development
of
human
history
on
earth
for
augustine
as
for
any
medieval
believer
the
course
of
history
would
be
satisfactorily
complete
if
the
world
came
to
an
end
in
his
own
lifetime
he
was
not
interested
in
the
question
whether
any
gradual
amelioration
of
society
or
increase
of
knowledge
would
mark
the
period
of
time
which
might
still
remain
to
run
before
the
day
of
judgment
in
augustine
system
the
christian
era
introduced
the
last
period
of
history
the
old
age
of
humanity
which
would
endure
only
so
long
as
to
enable
the
deity
to
gather
in
the
predestined
number
of
saved
people
this
theory
might
be
combined
with
the
belief
in
a
millennium
on
earth
but
the
conception
of
such
a
dispensation
does
not
render
it
a
theory
of
progress
again
the
medieval
doctrine
apprehends
history
not
as
a
natural
development
but
as
a
series
of
events
ordered
by
divine
intervention
and
revelations
if
humanity
had
been
left
to
go
its
own
way
it
would
have
drifted
to
a
highly
undesirable
port
and
all
men
would
have
incurred
the
fate
of
everlasting
misery
from
which
supernatural
interference
rescued
the
minority
a
belief
in
providence
might
indeed
and
in
a
future
age
would
be
held
along
with
a
belief
in
progress
in
the
same
mind
but
the
fundamental
assumptions
were
incongruous
and
so
long
as
the
doctrine
of
providence
was
undisputedly
in
the
ascendant
a
doctrine
of
progress
could
not
arise
and
the
doctrine
of
providence
as
it
was
developed
in
augustine
city
of
god
controlled
the
thought
of
the
middle
ages
there
was
moreover
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
an
insuperable
obstacle
to
the
moral
amelioration
of
the
race
by
any
gradual
process
of
development
for
since
so
long
as
the
human
species
endures
on

every
child
will
be
born
naturally
evil
and
worthy
of
punishment
a

there
are

must
not

the
significance
in

first
place
while
it
maintained
the
belief
in

definitely
abandoned

phenomenon
in

it
would
never

again

anything
resembling
it
more
important
than
all
is
the
fact
that
christian
theology
constructed
a
synthesis
which
for
the
first
time
attempted
to
give
a
definite
meaning
to
the
whole
course
of
human
events
a
synthesis
which
represents
the
past
as
leading
up
to
a
definite
and
desirable
goal
in
the

this
belief
had
been
generally
adopted
and
prevailed
for
centuries
men
might
discard
it
along
with
the
doctrine
of

on
which
it
rested

they
could

for
him
that
he
announced
the
idea

he
has
even
been
compared
to

such
claims
are
based
on
passages
taken

and
indulgently
interpreted
in
the

of

theories
they
are
not
borne
out
by
an
examination
of
his
general
conception
of
the
universe
and
the
aim
of
his

his
aim
was
to
reform
higher
education
and
introduce
into
the
universities
a
wide
liberal
and
scientific
programme
of
secular
studies
his
chief
work
the
opus

was
written
for
this
purpose
to
which
his
exposition
of
his
own
discoveries
was
subordinate
it
was
addressed
and
sent
to
pope
clement
who
had
asked
bacon
to
give
him
an
account
of
his
researches
and
was
designed
to
persuade
the
pontiff
of
the
utility
of
science
from
an
ecclesiastical
point
of
view
and
to
induce
him
to
sanction
an
intellectual
reform
which
without
the
approbation
of
the
church
would
at
that
time
have
been
impossible
with
great
ingenuity
and
resourcefulness
he
sought
to
show
that
the
studies
to
which
he
was
devoted
mathematics
astronomy
physics
chemistry
were
indispensable
to
an
intelligent
study
of
theology
and
scripture
though
some
of
his
arguments
may
have
been
urged
simply
to
capture
the
pope
there
can
be
no
question
that
bacon
was
absolutely
sincere
in
his
view
that
theology
was
the
mistress
dominatrix
of
the
sciences
and
that
their
supreme
value
lay
in
being
necessary
to
it
it
was
indeed
on
this
principle
of
the
close
interconnection
of
all
branches
of
knowledge
that
bacon
based
his
plea
and
his
scheme
of
reform
and
the
idea
of
the
solidarity
of
the
sciences
in
which
he
anticipated
a
later
age
is
one
of
his
two
chief
claims
to

maintained
like

telling
us

has
decreed
from

by

were
made

most

was

was
not
till
the
closing
years

its
way

new
points
of
departure
it

the

us
take
machiavelli
one
of
the
most
original
thinkers
that
italy
ever
produced
there
are
certain
fundamental
principles
underlying
science
of
politics
which
he
has
indicated
incidentally
in
his
unsystematic
way
but
which
are
essential
to
the
comprehension
of
his
doctrines
the
first
is
that
at
all
times
the
world
of
human
beings
has
been
the
same
varying
indeed
from
land
to
land
but
always
presenting
the
same
aspect
of
some
societies
advancing
towards
prosperity
and
others
declining
those
which
are
on
the
upward
grade
will
always
reach
a
point
beyond
which
they
can
not
rise
further
but
they
will
not
remain
permanently
on
this
level
they
will
begin
to
decline
for
human
things
are
always
in
motion
and
therefore
must
go
up
or
down
similarly
declining
states
will
ultimately
touch
bottom
and
then
begin
to
ascend
thus
a
good
constitution
or
social
organisation
can
last
only

a
short
time

by

and
it
followed
from
his
premisses
that
the
study
of
the
past
is
of
the
highest
value

to

his
fundamental
theory
excluded
any
conception

social
order

emerging

the
impersonal
work

another
point

with

the

if
not
held
afterwards

form

machiavelli
presented
them

it
has
well

machiavelli
sameness
of
human
nature
meant
that
man
would
always
have
the
same
passions
and
desires
weaknesses
and
vices
this
assumption
was
compatible
with
the
widely
prevailing
view
that
man
had
degenerated
in
the
course
of
the
last
fifteen
hundred
years
from
the
exaltation
of
greek
and
roman
antiquity
to
a
position
of
unattainable
superiority
especially
in
the
field
of
knowledge
the
degeneration
of
humanity
was
an
easy
and
natural
inference
if
the
greeks
in
philosophy
and
science
were
authoritative
guides
if
in
art
and
literature
they
were
unapproachable
if
the
roman
republic
as
machiavelli
thought
was
an
ideal
state
it
would
seem
that
the
powers
of
nature
had
declined
and
she
could
no
longer
produce
the
same
quality
of
brain
so
long
as
this
paralysing
theory
prevailed
it
is
manifest
that
the
idea
of
progress
could
not
appear
but
in
the
course
of
the
sixteenth
century
men
began
here
and
there
somewhat
timidly
and
tentatively
to
rebel
against
the
tyranny
of
antiquity

rather
to
prepare
the
way
for
the

branches

an
innovation
was
beginning
which
heralded
a
radical
revolution
in
the
study
of
natural
phenomena
though
the
general
significance
of
the
prospect
which
these
researches
opened
was
but
vaguely
understood
at
the
time
the
thinkers
and
men
of
science
were
living
in
an
intellectual
twilight
it
was
the
twilight
of
dawn
at
one
extremity
we
have
mysticism
which
culminated
in
the
speculations
of
bruno
and
campanella
at
the
other
we
have
the
scepticism
of
montaigne
charron
and
sanchez
the
bewildered
condition
of
knowledge
is
indicated
by
the
fact
that
while
bruno
and
campanella
accepted
the
copernican
astronomy
it
was
rejected
by
one
who
in
many
other
respects
may
claim
to
be
reckoned
as
a
modern
i
mean
francis
bacon
but
the
growing
tendency
to
challenge
the
authority
of
the
ancients
does
not
sever
this
period
from
the
spirit
which
informed
the
renaissance
for
it
is
subordinate
or
incidental
to
a
more
general
and
important
interest
to
rehabilitate
the
natural
man
to
claim
that
he
should
be
the
pilot
of
his
own
course
to
assert
his
freedom
in
the
fields
of
art
and
literature
had
been
the
work
of
the
early
renaissance
it
was
the
problem
of
the
later
renaissance
to
complete
this
emancipation
in
the
sphere
of
philosophical
thought
the
bold
metaphysics
of
bruno
for
which
he
atoned
by
a
fiery
death
offered
the
solution
which
was
most
unorthodox
and
complete
his
deification
of
nature
and
of
man
as
part
of
nature
involved
the
liberation
of
humanity
from
external
authority
but
other
speculative
minds
of
the
age
though
less
audacious
were
equally
inspired
by
the
idea
of
freely
interrogating
nature
and
were
all
engaged
in
accomplishing
the
programme
of
the
renaissance
the
vindication
of
this
world
as
possessing
a
value
for
man
independent
of
its
relations
to
any
supermundane
sphere
the
raptures
of
giordano
bruno
and
the
sobrieties
of
francis
bacon
are
here
on
common
ground
the
whole
movement
was
a
necessary
prelude
to
a
new
age
of
which
science
was
to
be
the
mistress
it
is
to
be
noted
that
there
was
a
general
feeling
of
complacency
as
to
the
condition
of
learning
and
intellectual
pursuits
this
optimism
is
expressed
by
rabelais
gargantua

there
such
facilities
for
study
as
one
sees
now
it
is
indeed
the
study
of
the
ancient
languages
and
literatures
that
gargantua
considers
in
a
liberal
education
but
the
satisfaction
at
the
present
diffusion
of
learning
with
the
suggestion
that
here
at

have
an
advantage
over
the

a

from
the
genius

the
french

who
published
his
introduction
to

a

thought
than
machiavelli

mind
was
entirely
concentrated
on
the
theory
of
politics

his
importance

not
in

political

which
he
sought
to
prove
that
monarchy
is

in
his
attempt
to
substitute
a
new
theory
of
universal
history
for
that
which
prevailed
in
the
middle
ages
he
rejected
the
popular
conception
of
a
golden
age

a
subsequent
degeneration
of
mankind

he
refuted
the
view
generally
current

divided
the
course

history

and
roman
monarchies
the
last
of
which
was
to
endure
till
the
day
of
judgement
bodin
suggests
a
division
into
three
great
periods
the
first
of
about
two
thousand
years
in
which
the
peoples
were
predominant
the
second
of
the
same
duration
in
which
those
whom
he
calls
the
middle
mediterranean
peoples
came
to
the
front
the
third
in
which
the
northern
nations
who
overthrew
rome
became
the
leaders
in
civilisation
each
period
is
stamped
by
the
psychological
character
of
the
three
racial
groups
the
note
of
the
first
is
religion
of
the
second
practical
sagacity
of
the
third

thus
bodin
recognises
a
general
progress
in
the

is
nothing
new

was
the
view
for

of
the
epicureans

much
had
passed
in

world

consider
twelve
hundred
years
of
new
vicissitudes

the
epicurean
theory
be
brought
up
to
date
bodin
deals
with
the
question
almost
entirely
in
respect
to
human
knowledge
in
definitely
denying
the
degeneration
of
man
bodin
was
only
expressing
what
many
thinkers
of
the
sixteenth
century
had
been
coming
to
feel
though
timidly
and
obscurely
the
philosophers
and
men
of
science
who
criticised
the
ancients
in
special
departments
did
not
formulate
any
general
view
on
the
privileged
position
of
antiquity
bodin
was
the
first
to
do
so
knowledge
letters
and
arts
have
their
vicissitudes

says
they
rise
increase
and
nourish
and
then
languish
and
die
after
the
decay
of
rome

was
a
long
fallow

splendid
revival

no

exceeded

have
made
new

equal
or
indeed
greater

for

the

the
circumnavigation

out

an
inference
from
all
this
obvious
to
a
modern
reader
would
be
that
in

there
will
be
similar
oscillations
and
new
inventions
and
discoveries
as
remarkable
as
any
that
have
been
made
in
the
past

bodin
does
not
draw
this
inference
he
confines
himself
to
the
past
and
present
and
has
no
word
to
say
about
the
vicissitudes
of
the
future

he
is
not
haunted
by
any
vision
of
the
end
of

the
coming
of

centuries
of
humanism
lay
between
him
and
roger

yet
the
influence
of
medievalism
which
it
had
been
the
work
of
those
three
centuries

overcome

still
pervasively
there
still
more
the
authority
of
the
greeks

which
had
been
set
up
by
the
revival
of

was
without
their
realising
it
heavy
even
upon
thinkers
like
bodin
who
did
not
scruple
freely
to
criticise
ancient
authors
and
so
in
his
thoughtful
attempt
to
find
a
clew
to
universal
history
he
was
hampered
by
theological
and
cosmic
theories
the
legacy
of
the
past
it
is
significant
of
the
trend
of
his
mind
that
when
he
is
discussing
the
periodic
decline
of
science
and
letters
he
suggests
that
it
may
be
due
to
the
direct
action
of
god
punishing
those
who
misapplied
useful
sciences
to
the
destruction
of
men
but
his
speculations
were
particularly
compromised
by
his
belief
in
astrology
which
notwithstanding
the
efforts
of
humanists
like
petrarch
aeneas
sylvius
and
pico
to
discredit
it
retained
its
hold
over
the
minds
of
many
eminent

reviving
the
ideas

working
them
out
in
a
way

his

enumerates
the
durations
of
the

of
many
famous
men
to
show
that
they
can
be
expressed
by
powers

the

equal

he
gives
many
examples
to
prove

mystic

determine
the
durations
of
empires
and
underlie

chronology

best
that
can
be
said
for
it
is
that
both
here

crudely
attempting
to
bring
human

this

is
chiefly
devoted
to
a
full
analysis
of
la

he
is
careful
however
to
avoid
fatalism
he
asserts
as
we
have
seen
that
history
depends
largely
on
the
will
of
men
and
he
comes
nearer
to
the
idea
of
progress
than
any
one
before
him
he
is
on
the
threshold
for
if
we
eliminate
his
astrological
and
pythagorean
speculations
and
various
theological
parentheses
which
do
not
disturb
his
argument
his
work
announces
a
new
view
of
history
which
is
optimistic
regarding
career
on
earth
without
any
reference
to
his
destinies
in
a
future
life
and
in
this
optimistic
view
there
are
three
particular
points
to
note
which
were
essential
to
the
subsequent
growth
of
the
idea
of
progress
in
the
first
place
the
decisive
rejection
of
the
theory
of
degeneration
which
had
been
a
perpetual
obstacle
to
the
apprehension
of
that
idea
secondly
the
unreserved
claim
that
his
own
age
was
fully
equal
and
in
some
respects
superior
to
the
age
of
classical
antiquity
in
respect
of
science
and
the
arts
he
leaves
the
ancients
reverently
on
their
pedestal
but
he
erects
another
pedestal
for
the
moderns
and
it
is
rather
higher
we
shall
see
the
import
of
this
when
we
come
to
consider
the
intellectual
movement
in
which
the
idea
of
progress
was
afterwards
to
emerge
in
the
third
place
he
had
a
conception
of
the
common
interest
of
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
a
conception
which
corresponded
to
the
old
ecumenical
idea
of
the
greeks
and
romans
footnote

but
had
now
a
new
significance
through
the
discoveries
of

speaks
repeatedly

as
a
universal
state
and
suggests
that
the
various
races
by
their
peculiar
aptitudes
and
qualities
contribute
to
the
common
good
of
the
whole

idea
of
the

it

to
the
law
which
has
hitherto
prevailed

us
act
as
if
it
would
this
is
the
practical
moral
that
le

enforces
in
the
last
book
of
his
dissertation
we
must
not
allow
ourselves
to
be
paralysed
or
dismayed
by
the
destinies
of

civilisations

must
work
hard
to
transmit
to

all
that
has
been
achieved
and
augment
the
discoveries
of
the
past
by
new
researches

knowledge

inexhaustible

us
not
be
so
simple
as
to
believe
that
the

have
known
and
said
everything
and
left
nothing
to

that

gave

lays
down

which
was
to
be

more
urgently
in

century
the
permanence

forces
nature
is
the

can
produce

to
set

act
on
an
but
the
determination
of
the
optimist
to
escape
from
the
logic
of
his
own
argument
is
significant
he
has
no
conception
of
an
increasing
purpose
or
underlying
unity
in
the
history
of
man
but
he
thinks
that

the

of

history
with
a
view
to
the
coming

for
some
unknown
reason
prolong

obeying
the
instinct
of
optimism
and
confidence
which
was
already
beginning
to
create
the
appropriate
atmosphere
for
the
intellectual
revolution
of
the
coming

translated
into

neither
in

nor
in

had
it

influence
as

insinuated

the

have
observed

three
views

taught

francis

a

breaking
with

making

and
his
whole
method
of
thought
seems
intellectually
nearer
to
us
than
the
speculations
of
a
bruno
or
a

hence
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
he
is
often
regarded
especially
in
his
own
country
as
more
than
a
precursor
as
the
first
philosopher
of

it
must
be
recognised

if
in
many
respects
bacon
is
in
advance
of
contemporaries
who
can
not

dissociated
from
the
renaissance
in
other
respects
such
as
belief
in

he
stands
on

ground

essential
point
which
might
almost
be
taken
as
the
test
of
mental
progress
at
this
period

outstripped
him
for
him

kepler
and

worked
in

he
obstinately
adhered
to
the
old
geocentric
system
it
must
also
be
remembered
that
the
principle
which
he
laid
down
in
his
ambitious
programme
for
the
reform
of
science
that
experiment
is
the
key
for
discovering
the
secrets
of
nature
was
not
a
new
revelation
we
need
not
dwell
on
the
fact
that
he
had
been
anticipated
by
roger
bacon
for
the
ideas
of
that
wonderful
thinker
had
fallen
dead
in
an
age
which
was
not
ripe
for
them
but
the
direct
interrogation
of
nature
was
already
recognised
both
in
practice
and
in
theory
in
the
sixteenth
century
what
bacon
did
was
to
insist
upon
the
principle
more
strongly
and
explicitly
and
to
formulate
it
more
precisely
he
clarified
and
explained
the
progressive
ideas
which
inspired
the
scientific
thought
of
the
last
period
of
the
european
renaissance
from
which
he
can
not
i
think
be
dissociated
but
in
clearing
up
and
defining
these
progressive
ideas
he
made
a
contribution
to
the
development
of
human
thought
which
had
importance
and
has
a
special
significance
for
our
present
subject
in
the
hopes
of
a
steady
increase
of
knowledge
based
on
the
application
of
new
methods
he
had
been
anticipated
by
roger
bacon
and
further
back
by
seneca
but
with
francis
bacon
this
idea
of
the
augmentation
of
knowledge
has
an
entirely
new
value
for
seneca
the
exploration
of
nature
was
a
means
of
escaping
from
the
sordid
miseries
of
life
for
the
friar
of
oxford
the
principal
use
of
increasing
knowledge
was
to
prepare
for
the
coming
of
antichrist

bacon
sounded
the

the
principle
that
the
proper
aim
of

is
the
amelioration
of
human
life
to
increase
men
happiness
and
mitigate
their
sufferings
commodis
humanis
inservire
was
the
guiding
star
of
bacon
in
all
his
intellectual
labour
he
declared
the
advancement
of
the
happiness
of
mankind
to
be
the
direct
purpose
of
the
works
he
had
written
or
designed
he
considered
that
all
his
predecessors
had
gone
wrong
because
they
did
not
apprehend
that
the
finis
scientarum
the
real
and
legitimate
goal
of
the
sciences
is
the
endowment
of
human
life
with
new
inventions
and
riches
and
he
made
this
the
test
for
defining
the
comparative
values
of
the
various
branches
of
knowledge
the
true
object
therefore
of
the
investigation
of
nature
is
not
as
the
greek
philosophers
held
speculative
satisfaction
but
to
establish
the
reign
of
man
over
nature
and
this
bacon
judged
to
be
attainable
provided
new
methods
of
attacking
the
problems
were
introduced
whatever
may
be
thought
of
his
daring
act
in
bringing
natural
science
down
from
the
clouds
and
assigning
to
her
the
function
of
ministering
to
the
material
convenience
and
comfort
of
man
we
may
criticise
bacon
for
his
doctrine
that
every
branch
of
science
should
be
pursued
with
a
single
eye
towards
practical
use
mathematics
he
thought
should
conduct
herself
as
a
humble
if
necessary
handmaid
without
any
aspirations
of
her
own
but
it
is
not
thus
that
the
great
progress
in
man
command
over
nature
since
bacon
age
has
been
effected

there

hardly

a
remark

recur
in

antiquitas

iuventus

what
we

antiquity

it
is
the
old
age

increasing
years
of
the

the
time
in
which
we
are
now
living
that
deserves
in
truth
to
be
called
antiquity
we
are
really
the
ancients
the
greeks
and
romans
were
younger
than
we
in
respect
to
the
age
of
the
world
and
as
we
look
to
an
old
man
for
greater
knowledge
of
the
world
than
from
a
young
man
so
we
have
good
reason
to
expect
far
greater
things
from
our
own
age
than
from
antiquity
because
in
the
meantime
the
stock
of
knowledge
has
been
increased

an
endless
number

let
me
quote
one
passage
it
may
truly
be
affirmed
to
the
honour
of
these
times
and
in
a
virtuous
emulation
with
antiquity
that
this
great
building
of
the
world
had
never
made
in
it
till
the
age
of
us
and
our
fathers
for
although
they
the
ancients
had
knowledge
of
the
antipodes
yet
that
mought
be
by
demonstration
and
not
in
fact
and
if
by
travel
it
requireth
the
voyage
but
of
half
the
earth
but
to
circle
the
earth
as
the
heavenly
bodies
do
was
not
done
nor
enterprised
till
these
later
times
and
therefore
these
times
may
justly
bear
in
their
word
plus
ultra
in
precedence
of
the
ancient
non
ultra
and
this
proficience
in
navigation
and
discoveries
may
plant
also
an
expectation
of
the
further
proficience
and
augmentation
of
all
sciences
because
it
may
seem
that
they
are
ordained
by
god
to
be
coevals

is
to
meet
in

the

out

siculus
ii
a
word
or
two
more
may
be
said
about
the
city
of
the
sun
campanella
was
as
earnest
a
believer
in
the
interrogation
of
nature
as
bacon
and
the
place
which
science
and
learning
hold
in
his
state
although
research
is
not
so
prominent
as
in
the
new
atlantis
and
the
scientific
training
of
all
the
citizens
are
a
capital
feature
the
progress
in
inventions
to
which
science
may
look
forward
is
suggested
the
men
of
the
city
of
the
sun
have
already
discovered
the
one
art
which
the
world
seemed
to
lack
the
art
of
flying
and
they
expect
soon
to
invent
ocular
instruments
which
will
enable
them
to
see
the
invisible
stars
and
auricular
instruments
for
hearing
the
harmony
of
the
spheres
campanella
view
of
the
present
conditions
and
prospects
of
knowledge
is
hardly
less
sanguine
than
that
of
bacon
and
characteristically
he
confirms
his
optimism
by
astrological
data
if
you
only
knew
what
their
astrologers
say
about
the
coming
age
our
times
they
assert
have
more
history
in
a
hundred
years
than
the
whole
world
in
four
thousand
more
books
have
been
published
in
this
century
than
in
five
thousand
years
before
they
dwell
on
the
wonderful
inventions
of
printing
of
artillery
and
of
the
use
of
the
magnet
clear
signs
of
the
times
and
also
instruments
for
the
assembling
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
into
one
fold
and
show
that
these
discoveries
were
conditioned
by
stellar
influences
but
campanella
is
not
very
sure
or
clear
about
the
future
astrology
and
theology
cause
him
to
hesitate
like
bacon
he
dreams
of
a
great
renovation
and
sees
that
the
conditions
are
propitious
but
his
faith
is
not
secure
the
astronomers
of
his
imaginary
state
scrutinise
the
stars
to
discover
whether
the
world
will
perish
or
not
and
they
believe
in
the
oracular
saying
of
jesus
that
the
end
will
come
like
a
thief
in
the
night
therefore
they
expect
a
new
age
and
perhaps
also
the
end
of
the
world
the
new
age
of

about
to

his
genius
exercised

extensive
and

influence
on
the
future

of
thought
than
any

of
his

cartesianism
affirmed
the
two
positive
axioms
of
the
supremacy
of
reason
and
the
invariability
of
the
laws
of
nature
and
its
instrument
was
a
new
rigorous
analytical
method
which
was
applicable
to
history
as
well
as
to
physical
knowledge
the
axioms
had
destructive
corollaries
the
immutability
of
the
processes
of
nature
collided
with
the
theory
of
an
active
providence
the
supremacy
of
reason
shook
the
thrones
from
which
authority
and
tradition
had
tyrannised
over
the
brains
of
men
cartesianism
was
equivalent
to
a
declaration
of
the
independence
of
man
it
was
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
cartesian
spirit
that
a
theory
of
progress
was
to
take
shape
let
us
look
back
we
saw
that
all
the
remarks
of
philosophers
prior
to
the
seventeenth
century
which
have
been
claimed
as
enunciations
of
the
idea
of
progress
amount
merely
to
recognitions
of
the
obvious
fact
that
in
the
course
of
the
past
history
of
men
there
have
been
advances
and
improvements
in
knowledge
and
arts
or
that
we
may
look
for
some
improvements
in
the
future
there
is
not
one
of
them
that
adumbrates
a
theory
that
can
be
called
a
theory
of
progress
we
have
seen
several
reasons
why
the
idea
could
not
emerge
in
the
ancient
or
in
the
middle
ages
nor
could
it
have
easily
appeared
in
the
period
of
the
renaissance
certain
preliminary
conditions
were
required
and
these
were
not
fulfilled
till
the
seventeenth
century
so
long
as
men
believed
that
the
greeks
and
romans
had
attained
in
the
best
days
of
their
civilisation
to
an
intellectual
plane
which
posterity
could
never
hope
to
reach
so
long
as
the
authority
of
their
thinkers
was
set
up
as
unimpeachable
a
theory
of
degeneration
held
the
field
which
excluded
a
theory
of
progress
it
was
the
work
of
bacon
and
descartes
to
liberate
science
and
philosophy
from
the
yoke
of
that
authority
and
at
the
same
time
as
we
shall
see
the
rebellion
began
to
spread
to
other
fields
another
condition
for
the
organisation
of
a
theory
of
progress
was
a
frank
recognition
of
the
value
of
mundane
life
and
the
subservience
of
knowledge
to
human
needs
the
secular
spirit
of
the
renaissance
prepared
the
world
for
this
new
valuation
which
was
formulated
by
bacon
and
has
developed
into
modern
utilitarianism
there
was
yet
a
third
preliminary
condition
there
can
be
no
certainty
that
knowledge
will
continually
progress
until
science
has
been
placed
on
sure
foundations
and
science
does
not
rest
for
us
on
sure
foundations
unless
the
invariability
of
the
laws
of
nature
is
admitted
if
we
do
not
accept
this
hypothesis
if
we
consider
it
possible
that
the
uniformities
of
the
natural
world
may
be
changed
from
time
to
time
we
have
no
guarantee
that
science
can
progress
indefinitely
the
philosophy
of
descartes
established
this
principle
which
is
the
palladium
of
science
and
thus
the
third
preliminary
condition
was
fulfilled
during
the
renaissance
period
the
authority
of
the
greeks
and
romans
had
been
supreme
in
the
realm
of
thought
and
in
the
interest
of
further
free
development
it
was
necessary
that
this
authority
should
be
weakened
bacon
and
others
had
begun
the
movement
to
break
down
this
tyranny
but
the
influence
of
descartes
was
weightier
and
more
decisive
and
his
attitude
was
more
uncompromising
he
had
none
of
reverence
for
classical
literature
he
was
proud
of
having
forgotten
the
greek
which
he
had
learned
as
a
boy
the
inspiration
of
his
work
was
the
idea
of
breaking
sharply
and
completely
with
the
past
and
constructing
a
system
which
borrows
nothing
from
the
dead
he
looked
forward
to
an
advancement
of
knowledge
in
the
future
on
the
basis
of
his
own
method
and
his
own
discoveries
footnote
cf
for
instance
his
remarks
on
medicine
at
the
end
of
the
discours
de
la
methode
and
he
conceived
that
this
intellectual
advance
would
have
effects
on
the
condition
of
mankind
the
first
title
he
had
proposed
to
give
to
his
discourse
on
method
was
the
project
of
a
universal
science
which
can
elevate
our
nature
to
its
highest
degree
of
perfection
he
regarded
moral
and
material
improvement
as
depending
on
philosophy
and
science
the
justification
of
an
independent
attitude
towards
antiquity
on
the
ground
that
the
world
is
now
older
and
more
mature
was
becoming
a
current
view

who
till
was
a
man
of
science
and
a
convert
to
cartesian
ideas
put
it
in
a
striking
way
the
whole
sequence
of
men
he
says
during
so
many
centuries
should
be
considered
as
a
single
man
continually
existing
and
continually
learning
at
each
stage
of
his
life
this
universal
man
profited
by
the
knowledge
he
had
acquired
in
the
preceding
stages
and
he
is
now
in
his
old
age
this
is
a
fuller
and
probably
an
independent
development
of
the
comparison
of
the
race
to
an
individual
which
we
found
in
bacon
it
occurs
in
a
fragment
which
remained
unpublished
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
and
is
often
quoted
as
a
recognition
not
of
a
general
progress
of
man
but
of
a
progress
in
human
knowledge
to
those
who
reproached
descartes
with
disrespect
towards
ancient
thinkers
he
might
have
replied
that
in
repudiating
their
authority
he
was
really
paying
them
the
compliment
of
imitation
and
acting
far
more
in
their
own
spirit
than
those
who
slavishly
followed
them
pascal
saw
this
point
what
can
be
more
unjust
he
wrote
than
to
treat
our
ancients
with
greater
consideration
than
they
showed
towards
their
own
predecessors
and
to
have
for
them
this
incredible
respect
which
they
deserve
from
us
only
because
they
entertained
no
such
regard
for
those
who
had
the
same
advantage
of
antiquity
over
them
footnote

at
the
same
time
pascal
recognised
that
we
are
indebted
to
the
ancients
for
our
very
superiority
to
them
in
the
extent
of
our
knowledge
they
reached
a

point

effort
enables
us
to
mount
higher
so
that
we
find
ourselves
on

loftier
plane
with

trouble
and
less
glory
the
attitude
of
descartes
was
very
different
aspiring
to
begin
ab
integro
and
reform
the
foundations
of
knowledge
he
ignored
or
made
little
of
what
had
been
achieved
in
the
past
he
attempted
to
cut
the
threads
of
continuity
as
with

footnote
he
may
be
reproached
himself
with
scholasticism
in
his
metaphysical
reasoning
hindered
him
from
stating

doctrine

knowledge

otherwise
he
might
have
done

any
such
doctrine

take
account
of
the
past

but
a
theory
of

was
to
grow
out
of
his
philosophy
though
he
did
not
construct
it
it
was
to
be
developed
by
men
who
were
imbued
with
the
cartesian
spirit
the
theological
world
in
france
was
at
first
divided
on
the
question
whether
the
system
of
descartes
could
be
reconciled
with
orthodoxy
or
not
the
jesuits
said
no
the
fathers
of
the
oratory
said
yes
the
jansenists
of
port
royal
were
enthusiastic
cartesians
yet
it
was
probably
the
influence
of
the
great
spiritual
force
of
jansenism
that
did
most
to
check
the
immediate
spread
of
cartesian
ideas
it
was
preponderant
in
france
for
fifty
years
the
date
of
the
discourse

made
jansenism
a
popular
power
the
jansenist
movement
was
in
france
in
some
measure
what
the
puritan
movement
was
in
england
and
it
caught
hold
of
serious
minds
in
much
the
same
way
the
jesuits
had
undertaken
the
task
of
making
christianity
easy
of
finding
a
compromise
between
worldliness
and
religion
and
they
flooded
the
world
with
a
casuistic
literature
designed
for
this
purpose
ex

the
doctrine
of
jansenius
was
directed
against
this
corruption
of
faith
and
morals
he
maintained
that
there
can
be
no
compromise
with
the
world
that
casuistry
is
incompatible
with
morality
that
man
is
naturally
corrupt
and
that
in
his
most
virtuous
acts
some
corruption
is
present

the
significance
of
these
two
forces
the
stern
ideal
of
the
jansenists
and
the
casuistry
of
the
jesuit
teachers
is
that
they
both
attempted
to
meet
by
opposed
methods
the
wave
of
libertine
thought
and
conduct
which
is
a
noticeable
feature
in

this
libertinism
had
its
philosophy

sort
of
philosophy
of
nature
of
which
the
most
brilliant
exponents
were
rabelais
and
moliere
the
maxim
be
true
to
nature
was
evidently
opposed
sharply
to
the
principles
of
the
christian
religion
and
it
was
associated
with
sceptical
views
which
prevailed
widely
in
france
from
the
early
years
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
jesuits
sought
to
make
terms
by
saying
virtually
our
religious
principles
and
your
philosophy

are
not
after

jansenius
and
his
followers
on
the
other
hand
fought
uncompromisingly
with
the
licentious
spirit
of
the
time
maintaining
the
austerest
dogmas
and
denouncing
any
compromise
or
condescension
and
their
doctrine
had
a
wonderful
success
and
penetrated
everywhere
few
of

great
literary
men
of

escaped
it
its
influence
can
be
traced
in
the
maximes
of
la

and
the

it
was
through
its
influence
that
moliere
found
it
difficult
to
get
some

it
explains
the
fact
that
the
court
of
louis
however
corrupt
was
decorous
compared
with
the
courts
of
henry
iv
and
louis
xv
a
severe
standard
was
set
up
if
it
was
not
observed
the
genius
of
pascal
made
the
fortunes
of
jansenism
he
outlived
his
cartesianism
and
became
its
most
influential
spokesman
his
provinciales
rendered
abstruse
questions
of
theology
more
or
less
intelligible
and
invited
the
general
public
to
pronounce
an
opinion
on
them
his
lucid
exposition
interested
every
one
in
the
abstruse
problem
is
man
freedom
such
as
not
to
render
grace
superfluous
but
pascal
perceived
that
casuistry
was
not
the
only
enemy
that
menaced
the
true
spirit
of
religion
for
which
jansenism
stood
he
came
to
realise
that
cartesianism
to
which
he
was
at
first
drawn
was
profoundly
opposed
to
the
fundamental
views
of
christianity
his
pensees
are
the
fragments
of
a
work
which
he
designed
in
defence
of
religion
and
it
is
easy
to
see
that
this
defence
was
to
be
specially
directed
against
the
ideas
of
descartes
pascal
was
perfectly
right
about
the
cartesian
conception
of
the
universe
though
descartes
might
pretend
to
mitigate
its
tendencies
and
his
fervent
disciple
malebranche
might
attempt
to
prove
that
it
was
more
or
less
reconcilable
with
orthodox
doctrine
we
need
not
trouble
about
the
special
metaphysical
tenets
of
descartes
the
two
axioms
which
he
launched
upon
the
world
the
supremacy
of
reason
and
the
invariability
of
natural
laws
struck
directly
at
the
foundations
of
orthodoxy
pascal
was
attacking
cartesianism
when
he
made
his
memorable
attempt
to
discredit
the
authority
of
reason
by
showing
that
it
is
feeble
and
deceptive
it
was
a
natural
consequence
of
his
changed
attitude
that
he
should
speak
in
the
pensees
in
a
much
less
confident
tone
about
the
march
of
science
than
he
had
spoken
in
the
passage
which
i
quoted
above
and
it
was
natural
that
he
should
be
pessimistic
about
social
improvement
and
that
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
central
fact
that
christianity
is
the
goal
of
history
he
should
take
only
a
slight
and
subsidiary
interest
in
amelioration
the
preponderant
influence
of
jansenism
only
began
to
wane
during
the
last
twenty
years
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
till
then
it
seems
to
have
been
successful
in
counteracting
the
diffusion
of
the
cartesian
ideas
cartesianism
begins
to
become
active
and
powerful
when
jansenism
is
beginning
to
decline
and
it
is
just
then
that
the
idea
of
progress
begins
definitely
to
emerge
the
atmosphere
in
france
was
favourable
for
its
reception
the
cartesian
mechanical
theory
of
the
world
and
the
doctrine
of
invariable
law
carried
to
a
logical
conclusion
excluded
the
doctrine
of
providence
this
doctrine
was
already
in
serious
danger
perhaps
no
article
of
faith
was
more
insistently
attacked
by
sceptics
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
none
was
more
vital
the
undermining
of
the
theory
of
providence
is
very
intimately
connected
with
our
subject
for
it
was
just
the
theory
of
an
active
providence
that
the
theory
of
progress
was
to
replace
and
it
was
not
till
men
felt
independent
of
providence
that
they
could
organise
a
theory
of
progress
bossuet
was
convinced
that
the
question
of
providence
was
the
most
serious
and
pressing
among
all
the
questions
of
the
day
that
were
at
issue
between
orthodox
and
heretical
thinkers
brunetiere
his
fervent
admirer
has
named
him
the
theologian
of
providence
and
has
shown
that
in
all
his
writings
this
doctrine
is
a
leading
note
it
is
sounded
in
his
early
sermons
in
the
fifties
and
it
is
the
theme
of
his
most
ambitious
work
the
discourse
on
universal
history
which
appeared
in
footnote
it
has
been
shown
that
on
one
hand
he
controverts
spinoza
tractatus

on
the
other

dangerous
methods

this
book
which
has
received
high
praise
from
those
who
most
heartily
dissent
from
its
conclusions
is
in
its
main
issue
a
restatement
of
the
view
of
history
which
augustine
had
worked
out
in
his
memorable
book
the
whole
course
of
human
experience
has
been
guided
by
providence
for
the
sake
of
the
church
that
is
for
the
sake
of
the
church
to
which
bossuet
belonged
regarded
as
a
philosophy
of
history
the
discourse
may
seem
little
more
than
the
theory
of
the
de
civitate
dei
brought
up
to
date
but
this
is
its
least
important
aspect
we
shall
fail
to
understand
it
unless
we
recognise
that
it
was
a
pragmatical
opportune
work
designed
for
the
needs
of
the
time
and
with
express
references
to
current
tendencies
of
thought
one
main
motive
of
bossuet
in
his
lifelong
concern
for
providence
was
his
conviction
that
the
doctrine
was
the
most
powerful
check
on
immorality
and
that
to
deny
it
was
to
remove
the
strongest
restraint
on
the
evil
side
of
human
nature
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
people
of
the
time
welcomed
the
arguments
which
called
providence
in
question
and
bossuet
believed
that
to
champion
providence
was
the
most
efficient
means
of
opposing
the
libertine
tendencies
of
his
day
nothing
he
declared
in
one
of
his
sermons
has
appeared
more
insufferable
to
the
arrogance
of
libertines
than
to
see
themselves
continually
under
the
observation
of
this
eye
of
providence
they
have
felt
it
as
an
importunate
compulsion
to
recognise
that
there
is
in
heaven
a
superior
force
which
governs
all
our
movements
and
chastises
our
loose
actions
with
a
severe
authority
they
have
wished
to
shake
off
the
yoke
of
this
providence
in
order
to
maintain
in
independence
an
unteachable
liberty
which
moves
them
to
live
at
their
own
fancy
without
fear
discipline
or
restraint
passage
from
bossuet

bossuet
was
thus
working
in
the
same
cause
as
the
jansenists
he
had
himself
come
under
the
influence
of
descartes
whose
work
he
always
regarded
with
the
deepest
respect
the
cautiousness
of
the
master
had
done
much
to
disguise
the
insidious
dangers
of
his
thought
and
it
was
in
the
hands
of
those
disciples
who
developed
his
system
and
sought
to
reconcile
it
at
all
points
with
orthodoxy
that
his
ideas
displayed
their
true
nature
malebranche
philosophy
revealed
the
incompatibility
of
providence
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
with
immutable
natural
laws
if
the
deity
acts
upon
the
world
as
malebranche
maintained
only
by
means
of
general
laws
his
freedom
is
abolished
his
omnipotence
is
endangered
he
is
subject
to
a
sort
of
fatality
what
will
become
of
the
christian
belief
in
the
value
of
prayers
if
god
can
not
adapt
or
modify
on
any
given
occasion
the
general
order
of
nature
to
the
needs
of
human
beings
these
are
some
of
the
arguments
which
we
find
in
a
treatise
composed
by
fenelon
with
the
assistance
of
bossuet
to
demonstrate
that
the
doctrine
of
malebranche
is
inconsistent
with
piety
and
orthodox
religion
they
were
right
cartesianism
was
too
strong

wine

be
decanted

urged
similar
arguments
malebranche
doctrine
of
what
he
calls
divine
providence
was
closely
connected
with
his
philosophical
optimism
it
enabled
him
to
maintain
the
perfection
of
the
universe
admitting
the
obvious
truth
that
the
world
exhibits
many
imperfections
and
allowing
that
the
creator
could
have
produced
a
better
result
if
he
had
employed
other
means
malebranche
argued
that
in
judging
the
world
we
must
take
into
account
not
only
the
result
but
the
methods
by
which
it
has
been
produced
it
is
the
best
world
he
asserts
that
could
be
framed
by
general
and
simple
methods
and
general
and
simple
methods
are
the
most
perfect
and
alone
worthy
of
the
creator
therefore
if
we
take
the
methods
and
the
result
together
a
more
perfect
world
is
impossible
the
argument
was
ingenious
though
full
of
assumptions
but
it
was
one
which
could
only
satisfy
a
philosopher
it
is
little
consolation
to
creatures
suffering
from
the
actual
imperfections
of
the
system
into
which
they
are
born
to
be
told
that
the
world
might
have
been
free
from
those
defects
only
in
that
case
they
would
not
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
it
was
created
and
conducted
on
theoretically
superior
principles
though
malebranche
conception
was
only
a
metaphysical
theory

stage
in
the
growth
of
intellectual
optimism

we
can
trace
from
the
sixteenth

a
view

could
appeal
to
the

devoted
themselves
to

consistent

to
improve
the
universal

for

that

the

the

outside
the
circle
of
systematic
thinkers
the
prevalent
theory
of
degeneration
was
being
challenged
early
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
challenge
led
to
a
literary
war
which
was
waged
for
about
a
hundred
years
in
france
and
england
over
the
comparative
merits
of
the
ancients
and
the
moderns
it
was
in
the
matter
of
literature
and
especially
poetry
that
the
quarrel
was
most
acrimonious
and
that
the
interest
of
the
public
was
most
keenly
aroused
but
the
ablest
disputants
extended
the
debate
to
the
general
field
of
knowledge
the
quarrel
of
the
ancients
and
moderns
used
commonly
to
be
dismissed
as
a
curious
and
rather
ridiculous
episode
in
the
history
of

i

one

the

the

has
considerable

the

the
perversities

of
which
they
were

their
polemic

convincingly
shown

the
form
in
which
the

forced
the

to
touch
upon

are
they
intellectually

the
assertion
of
the
permanence
of
the
powers
of
nature
by
the
champions
of
the
moderns
was
the
direct
contradiction
of
the
theory
of
degeneration
and
they
undoubtedly
contributed
much
towards
bringing
that
theory
into
discredit
when
we
grasp
this
it
will
not
be
surprising
to
find
that
the
first
clear
assertions
of
a
doctrine
of
progress
in
knowledge
were
provoked
by
the
controversy
about
the
ancients
and
moderns
although
the
great
scene
of
the
controversy
was
france
the
question
had
been
expressly
raised
by
an
italian
no
less
a
person
than
alessandro
tassoni
the
accomplished
author
of
that
famous
ironical
poem
la
secchia
rapita
which
caricatured
the
epic
poets
of
his
day
he
was
bent
on
exposing
the
prejudices
of
his

uttering
new
doctrine
and
he
created
great
scandal
in
italy
by
his
attacks
on
petrarch
as
well
as
on
homer
and
aristotle
the
earliest
comparison
of
the
merits

long
before

from
a
remark

estienne
in

apology

herodotus
that
while
some
of
his
contemporaries
carry
their
admiration
of
antiquity
to
the
point
of
superstition
others
depreciate
and
trample
it
underfoot
on
which
he
proposes
to
give
an
impartial
decision
by
instituting
a
comprehensive
comparison
in
all
fields
theoretical
imaginative
and
practical
he
begins
by
criticising
the
a
priori
argument
that
as
arts
are
brought
to
perfection
by
experience
and
long
labour
the
modern
age
must
necessarily
have
the
advantage
this
reasoning
he
says
is
unsound
because
the
same
arts
and
studies
are
not
always
uninterruptedly
pursued
by
the
most
powerful
intellects
but
pass
into
inferior
hands
and
so
decline
or
are
even
extinguished
as
was
the
case
in
italy
in
the
decrepitude
of
the
roman
empire
when
for
many
centuries
the
arts
fell
below
mediocrity
or
to
phrase
it
otherwise
the
argument
would
be
admissible
only
if
there
were
no
breaches
of
continuity

that
a
decline
in

claim

advocate

while
he
awards
superiority
here
and
there
to
the

the
moderns
on
the
whole
have
much
the
best
of
it
he
takes
a
wide
enough
survey
including
the
material
side
of
civilisation
even
costume
in
contrast
with
some
of
the
later
controversialists
who
narrowed
the
field
of
debate
to
literature
and
art
tassoni
thoughts
were
translated
into
french
and
the
book
was
probably
known
to
boisrobert
a
dramatist
who
is
chiefly
remembered
for
the
part
he
took
in
founding
the
academie
francaise
he
delivered
a
discourse
before
that
body
immediately
after
its
institution
february
in
which
he
made
a
violent
and
apparently
scurrilous
attack
on
homer
this
discourse
kindled
the
controversy
in
france
and
even
struck
a
characteristic
note
homer
already
severely
handled
by
tassoni
was
to
be
the
special
target
for
the
arrows
of
the
moderns
who
felt
that
if
they
could
succeed
in
discrediting
him
their
cause
would
be
won
thus
the
gauntlet
was
flung
and
it
is
important
to
note
this
before
the
appearance
of
the
discourse
of
method
but
the
influence
of
descartes
made
itself
felt
throughout
the
controversy
and
the
most
prominent
moderns
were
men
who
had
assimilated
cartesian
ideas
this
seems
to
be
true
even
of
desmarets
de
saint
sorlin
who
a
good
many
years
after
the
discourse

opened

the
polemic
of
saint
sorlin
extended
over
about
five
years
he
was
also
like
boisrobert
a
bad
poet
that
was
another
his
thesis
was
that
the
history
of
christianity
offered
subjects
far
more
inspiring
to
a
poet
than
those
which
had
been
treated
by
homer
and
sophocles
and
that
christian
poetry
must
bear
off
the
palm
from
pagan
his
own
clovis
and
mary
magdalene
or
the
triumph
of
grace
were
the
demonstration
of
homer
defeat
few
have
ever
heard
of
these
productions
how
many
have
read
them
curiously
about
the
same
time
an
epic
was
being
composed
in
england
which
might
have
given
to
the
foolish
contentions
of
saint
sorlin
some
illusory
plausibility
but
the
literary
dispute
does
not
concern
us
here
what
does
concern
us
is
that
saint
sorlin
was
aware
of
the
wider
aspects
of
the
question
though
he
was
not
seriously
interested
in
them
antiquity
he
says
was
not
so
happy
or
so
learned
or
so
rich
or
so
stately
as
the
modern
age
which
is
really
the
mature
old
age
and
as
it
were
the
autumn
of
the
world
possessing
the
fruits
and
the
spoils
of
all
the
past
centuries
with
the
power
to
judge
of
the
inventions
experiences
and
errors
of
predecessors
and
to
profit
by
all
that
the
ancient
world
was
a
spring
which
had
only
a
few
flowers
nature
indeed
in
all
ages
produces
perfect
works
but
it
is
not
so
with
the
creations
of
man
which
require
correction
and
the
men
who
live
latest
must
excel
in
happiness
and
knowledge
here
we
have
both
the
assertion
of
the
permanence
of
the
forces
of
nature
and
the
idea
already
expressed
by
bacon
and
others
that
the
modern
age
has
advantages
over
antiquity
comparable
to
those
of
old
age
over
childhood
how
seriously
the
question
between
the
moderns
and
the
ancients
on
whose
behalf
boileau
had
come
forward
and
crossed
swords
with
saint
sorlin
was
taken
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
saint
sorlin
before
his
death
solemnly
bequeathed
the
championship
of
the
moderns
to
a
younger
man
charles
perrault
we
shall
see
how
he
fulfilled
the
trust
it
is
illustrated
too
by
a
book
which
appeared
in
the
seventies
les
entretiens
et
eugene
by
bouhours
a
mundane
and
popular
jesuit
father
in
one
of
these
dialogues
the
question
is
raised
but
with
a
curious
caution
and
evasiveness
which
suggests
that
the
author
was
afraid
to
commit
himself
he
did
not
wish
to
make
enemies
footnote
rigault
notes
that
he
makes
one
contribution
to
the
subject
the
idea
that
the
torch
of
civilisation
has
passed
from
country
to
country
in
different
ages
from
greece
to
rome
and
recently
from
italy
to
france
in
the
last
century
the
italians
were
first
in
doctrine
and
politesse
the
present
century
is
for
france
what
the
last
was
for
italy
we
have
all
the
esprit
and
all
the
science
all
other
countries
are
barbarous
in
comparison
ed
amsterdam
but
as
we
shall
see
he
had
been
anticipated
by
hakewill
whose
work
was
unknown
to
rigault
the
general
atmosphere
in
france
in
the
reign
of
louis
was
propitious
to
the
cause
of
the
moderns
men
felt
that
it
was
a
great
age
comparable
to
the
age
of
augustus
and
few
would
have
preferred
to
have
lived
at
any
other
time
their
literary
artists
corneille
and
then
racine
and
moliere
appealed
so
strongly
to
their
taste
that
they
could
not
assign
to
them
any
rank
but
the
first
they
were
impatient
of
the
claims
to
unattainable
excellence
advanced
for
the
greeks
and
romans
the
ancients
said
moliere
are
the
ancients
we
are
the
people
of
this
might
be
the
motto
of
descartes
and
it
probably
expressed
a
very
general
feeling
it
was
in
that
charles
perrault
who
is
better
remembered
for
his
collection
of
than
for
the
leading
role
which
he
played
in
this
controversy
published
his
poem
on
the
age
of
louis
the
great
the
enlightenment
of
the
present
age
surpasses
that
of
antiquity
this
is
the
theme
la
docte
antiquite
dans

perrault
adopts
a
more
polite
attitude
to
la
belle
antiquite
than
saint
sorlin
but
his
criticism
is
more
insidious
greek
and
roman
men
of
genius
he
suggests
were
all
very
well
in
their
own
times
and
might
be
considered
divine
by
our
ancestors
but
nowadays
plato
is
rather
tiresome
and
the
inimitable
homer
would
have
written
a
much
better
epic
if
he
had
lived
in
the
reign
of
louis
the
great
the
important
passage
however
in
the
poem
is
that
in
which
the
permanent
power
of
nature
to
produce
men
of
equal
talent
in
every
age
is
affirmed

the
age
of
louis
the
great
was
a
brief
declaration
of
faith
perrault
followed
it
up
by
a
comprehensive
work
his
comparison
of
the
ancients
and
the
moderns
parallele
des
anciens
et
des
modernes
which
appeared
in
four
parts
during
the
following
years
art
eloquence
poetry
the
sciences
and
their
practical
applications
are
all
discussed
at
length
and
the
discussion
is
thrown
into
the
form
of
conversations
between
an
enthusiastic
champion
of
the
modern
age
who
conducts
the
debate
and
a
devotee
of
antiquity
who
finds
it
difficult
not
to
admit
the
arguments
of
his
opponent
yet
obstinately
persists
in
his
own
views
perrault
bases
his
thesis
on
those
general
considerations
which
we
have
met
incidentally
in
earlier
writers
and
which
were
now
almost
commonplaces
among
those
who
paid
any
attention
to
the
matter
knowledge
advances
with
time
and
experience
perfection
is
not
necessarily
associated
with
antiquity
the
latest
comers
have
inherited
from
their
predecessors
and
added
new
acquisitions
of
their
own
but
perrault
has
thought
out
the
subject
methodically
and
he
draws
conclusions
which
have
only
to
be
extended
to
amount
to
a
definite
theory
of
the
progress
of
knowledge
a
particular
difficulty
had
done
much
to
hinder
a
general
admission
of
progressive
improvement
in
the
past
the
proposition
that
the
posterior
is
better
and
the
late
comers
have
the
advantage
seemed
to
be
incompatible
with
an
obvious
historical
fact
we
are
superior
to
the
men
of
the
dark
ages
in
knowledge
and
arts
granted
but
will
you
say
that
the
men
of
the
tenth
century
were
superior
to
the
greeks
and
romans
to
this
question
on
which
tassoni
had
already
touched
perrault
replies
certainly
not
there
are
breaches
of
continuity
the
sciences
and
arts
are
like
rivers
which
flow
for
part
of
their
course
underground
and
then
finding
an
opening
spring
forth
as
abundant
as
when
they
plunged
beneath
the
earth
long
wars
for
instance
may
force
peoples
to
neglect
studies
and
throw
all
their
vigour
into
the
more
urgent
needs
of
a
period
of
ignorance
may
ensue
but
with
peace
and
felicity
knowledge
and
inventions
will
begin
again
and
make
further
advances
footnote

passages

perrault
parallele
specially
referred
to
in

be

in

it
is
to
be
observed
that
he
does
not
claim
any
superiority
in
talents
or
brain
power
for
the
moderns
on
the
contrary
he
takes
his
stand
on
the
principle
which
he
had
asserted
in
the
age
of
louis
the
great
that
nature
is
immutable
she
still
produces
as
great
men
as
ever
but
she
does
not
produce
greater
the
lions
of
the
deserts
of
africa
in
our
days
do
not
differ
in
fierceness
from
those
the
days
of
alexander
the
great
and
the
best
men
of
all
times
are
equal
in
vigour
it
is
their
work
and
productions
that
are
unequal
and
given
equally
favourable
conditions
the
latest
must
be
the
best
for
science
and
the
arts
depend
upon
the
accumulation
of
knowledge
and
knowledge
necessarily
increases
as
time
goes
on
but
could
this
argument
be
applied
to
poetry
and
literary
art
the
field
of
battle
in
which
the
belligerents
including
perrault
himself
were
most
deeply
interested
it
might
prove
that
the
modern
age
was
capable
of
producing
poets
and
men
of
letter
no
less
excellent
than
the
ancient
masters
but
did
it
prove
that
their
works
must
be
superior
the
objection
did
not
escape
perrault
and
he
answers
it
ingeniously
it
is
the
function
of
poetry
and
eloquence
to
please
the
human
heart
and
in
order
to
please
it
we
must
know
it
is
it
easier
to
penetrate
the
secrets
of
the
human
heart
than
the
secrets
of
nature
or
will
it
take
less
time
we
are
always
making
new
discoveries
about
its
passions
and
desires
to
take
only
the
tragedies
of
corneille
you
will
find
there
finer
and
more
delicate
reflections
on
ambition
vengeance
and
jealousy
than
in
all
the
books
of
antiquity
at
the
close
of
his
parallel
however
perrault
while
he
declares
the
general
superiority
of
the
moderns
makes
a
reservation
in
regard
to
poetry
and
eloquence
for
the
sake
of
peace
the
discussion
of
perrault
falls
far
short
of
embodying
a
full
idea
of
progress
not
only
is
he
exclusively
concerned
with
progress
in
knowledge
though
he
implies
indeed
without
developing
the
doctrine
that
happiness
depends
on
knowledge
but
he
has
no
eyes
for
the
future
and
no
interest
in
it
he
is
so
impressed
with
the
advance
of
knowledge
in
the
recent
past
that
he
is
almost
incapable
of
imagining
further
progression
read
the
journals
of
france
and
england
he
says
and
glance
at
the
publications
of
the
academies
of
these
great
kingdoms
and
you
will
be
convinced
that
within
the
last
twenty
or
thirty
years
more
discoveries
have
been
made
in
natural
science
than
throughout
the
period
of
learned
antiquity
i
own
that
i
consider
myself
fortunate
to
know
the
happiness
we
enjoy
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
survey
all
the
past
ages
in
which
i
can
see
the
birth
and
the
progress
of
all
things
but
nothing
which
has
not
received
a
new
increase
and
lustre
in
our
own
times
our
age
has
in
some
sort
arrived
at
the
summit
of
perfection
and
since
for
some
years
the
rate
of
the
progress
is
much
slower
and
appears
almost
insensible
as
the
days
seem
to
cease
lengthening
when
the
solstice
is
near
it
is
pleasant
to
think
that
probably
there
are
not
many
things
for
which
we
need
envy
future
generations
indifference
to
the
future
or
even
a
certain
scepticism
about
it
is
the
note
of
this
passage
and
accords
with
the
view
that
the
world
has
reached
its
old
age
the
idea
of
the
progress
of
knowledge
which
perrault
expounds
is
still
incomplete
independently
of
this

in
this
method
of
progress
the
lamp
of
learning
passed
from
one
people
to
another
it
passed
from
the
orientals
chaldeans
and
egyptians
to
the
greeks
when
it
was
nearly
extinguished
in
greece
it
began
to
shine
afresh
among
the
romans
and
having
been
put
out
by
the
barbarians
for
the
space
of
a
thousand
years
it
was
relit
by
petrarch
and
his
contemporaries
in
stating
this
view
of
circular
progress
hakewill
comes
perilously
near
to
the
doctrine
of
ricorsi
or
returns
which
had
been
severely
denounced
by
bacon
in
one
point
indeed
hakewill
goes
far
beyond
bodin
it
was
suggested
as
we
saw
by
the
french
thinker
that
in
some
respects
the
modern
age
is
superior
in
conduct
and
morals
to
antiquity
but
he
said
little
on
the
matter
hakewill
develops
the
suggestion
at
great
length
into
a
severe
and
partial
impeachment
of
ancient
manners
and
morals
unjust
and
unconvincing
though
his
arguments
are
and
inspired
by
theological
motives
his
thesis
nevertheless
deserves
to
be
noted
as
an
assertion
of
the
progress
of
man
in
social
morality
bacon
and
the
thinkers
of
the
seventeenth
century
generally
confined
their
views
of
progress
in
the
past
to
the
intellectual
field
hakewill
though
he
overshot
the
mark
and
said
nothing
actually
worth
remembering
nevertheless
anticipated
the
larger
problem
of
social
progress
which
was
to
come
to
the
front
in
the
eighteenth
century
during
the
forty
years
that
followed
the
appearance
of
hakewill
book
much
had
happened
in
the
world
of
ideas
and
when
we
take
up

the
progress

since
the

of

footnote
the
title
is
evidently
suggested
by
a
passage
in
bacon
quoted
above
p
we
breathe
a
different
atmosphere
it
was
published
in
and
its
purpose
was
to
defend
the
recently
founded
royal
society
which
was
attacked
on
the
ground
that
it
was
inimical
to
the
interests
of
religion
and
sound
learning
for
the
aristotelian
tradition
was
still
strongly
entrenched
in
the
english
church
and
universities
notwithstanding
the
influence
of
bacon
and
the
royal
society
which
realised
the
romantic
model
of
bacon
society
of
experimenters
repudiated
the
scholastic
principles
and
methods
associated
with
aristotle
name
glanvill
was
one
of
those
latitudinarian
clergymen
so
common
in
the
anglican
church
in
the
seventeenth
century
who
were
convinced
that
religious
faith
must
accord
with
reason
and
were
unwilling
to
abate
in
its
favour
any
of
reason
claims
he
was
under
the
influence
of
bacon
descartes
and
the
cambridge
platonists
and
no
one
was
more
enthusiastic
than
he
in
following
the
new
scientific
discoveries
of
his
time
unfortunately
for
his
reputation
he
had
a
weak
side
enlightened
though
he
was
he
was
a
firm
believer
in
witchcraft
and
he
is
chiefly
remembered
not
as
an
admirer
of
descartes
and
bacon
and
a
champion
of
the
royal
society
but
as
the
author
of
saducismus
triumphatus
a
monument
of
superstition
which
probably
contributed
to
check
the
gradual
growth
of
disbelief
in
witches
and
apparitions
his
plus
ultra
is
a
review
of
modern
improvements
of
useful
knowledge
it
is
confined
to
mathematics
and
science
in
accordance
with
its
purpose
of
justifying
the
royal
society
and
the
discoveries
of
the
past
sixty
years
enable
the
author
to
present
a
far
more
imposing
picture
of
modern
scientific
progress
than
was
possible
for
bodin
or
bacon
footnote
bacon
indeed
could
have
made
out
a
more
impressive
picture
of
the
new
age
if
he
had
studied
mathematics
and
taken
the
pains
to
master
the
evidence
which
was
revolutionising
astronomy
glanvill
had
the
advantage
of
comprehending
the
importance
of
mathematics
for
the
advance
of
physical
science
he
had
absorbed
bacon
doctrine
of
utility
his
spirit
is
displayed
in
the
remark
that
more
gratitude
is
due
to
the
unknown
inventor
of
the
mariners
compass
than
to
a
thousand
alexanders
and
caesars
or
to
ten
times
the
number
of
aristotles
and
he
really
did
more
for
the
increase
of
knowledge
and
the
advantage
of
the
world
by
this
one
experiment
than
the
numerous
subtile
disputers
that
have
lived
ever
since
the
erection
of
the
school
of
talking
glanvill
however
in
his
complacency
with
what
has
already
been
accomplished
is
not
misled
into
its
importance
he
knows
that
it
is
indeed
little
compared
with
the
ideal
of
attainable
knowledge
the
human
design
to
which
it
is
the
function
of
the
royal
society
to
contribute
is
laid
as
low
he
says
as
the
profoundest
depths
of
nature
and
reaches
as
high
as
the
uppermost
storey
of
the
universe
extends
to
all
the
varieties
of
the
great
world
and
aims
at
the
benefit
of
universal
mankind
such
a
work
can
only
proceed
slowly
by
insensible
degrees
it
is
an
undertaking
wherein
all
the
generations
of
men
are
concerned
and
our
own
age
can
hope
to
do
little
more
than
to
remove
useless
rubbish
lay
in
materials
and
put
things
in
order
for
the
building
we
must
seek
and
gather
observe
and
examine
and
lay
up
in
bank
for
the
ages
that
come
after
these
lines
on
the
vastness
of
the
work
suggest
to
the
reader
that
a
vast
future
will
be
needed
for
its
accomplishment
glanvill
does
not
dwell
on
this
but
he
implies
it
he
is
evidently
unembarrassed
by
the
theological
considerations
which
weighed
so
heavily
on
hakewill
he
does
not
trouble
himself
with
the
question
whether
has
still
to
appear
the
difference
in
general
outlook
between
these
two
clergymen
is
an
indication
how
the
world
had
travelled
in
the
course
of
forty
years
another
point
in
glanvill
little
book
deserves
attention
he
takes
into
his
prospect
the
inhabitants
of
the
transatlantic
world
they
too
are
to
share
in
the
benefits
which
shall
result
from
the
subjugation
of
nature
by
the
gaining
that
mighty
continent
and
the
numerous
fruitful
isles
beyond
the
atlantic
we
have
obtained
a
larger
field
of
nature
and
have
thereby
an
advantage
for
more
phenomena
and
more
helps
both
for
knowledge
and
for
life
which
is
very
like
that
future
ages
will
make
better
use
of
to
such
purposes
than
those
hitherto
have
done
and
that
science
also
may
at
last
travel
into
those
parts
and
enrich
peru
with
a
more
precious
treasure
than
that
of
its
golden
mines
is
not
improbable
sprat
the
bishop
of
rochester
in
his
interesting
history
of
the
royal
society
so
sensible
and
liberal
published
shortly
before
book
also
contemplates
the
extension
of
science
over
the
world
speaking
of
the
prospect
of
future
discoveries
he
thinks
it
will
partly
depend
on
the
enlargement
of
the
field
of
western
civilisation
if
this
mechanic
genius
which
now
prevails
in
these
parts
of
christendom
shall
happen
to
spread
wide
amongst
ourselves
and
other
civil
nations
or
if
by
some
good
fate
it
shall
pass
farther
on
to
other
countries
that
were
yet
never
fully
civilised
this
then
being
imagin
that
there
may
some
lucky
tide
of
civility
flow
into
those
lands
which
are
yet
salvage
then
will
a
double
improvement
thence
arise
both
in
respect
of
ourselves
and
them
for
even
the
present
skilful
parts
of
mankind
will
be
thereby
made
more
skilful
and
the
other
will
not
only
increase
those
arts
which
we
shall
bestow
upon
them
but
will
also
venture
on
new
searches
themselves
he
expects
much
from
the
new
converts
on
the
ground
that
nations
which
have
been
taught
have
proved
more
capable
than
their
teachers
appealing
to
the
case
of
the
greeks
who
outdid
their
eastern
masters

to
that

fontenelle
nine

was
fontenelle
fontenelle
was
an
anima

trained
in
the
principles
of
descartes
he
was
one
of
those
who
though
like
descartes
himself
too
critical
to
swear
by
a
master
appreciated
unreservedly
the
value
of
the
cartesian
method
sometimes
he
says
a
great
man
gives
the
tone
to
his
age
and
this
is
true
of
descartes
who
can
claim
the
glory
of
having
established
a
new
art
of
reasoning
he
sees
the
effects
in
literature
the
best
books
on
moral
and
political
subjects
are
distinguished
by
an
arrangement
and
precision

himself
had
this
geometrical
mind
which
we
see
at
its
best
in
descartes
and
hobbes
and

he
had
indeed
a
considerable
aptitude
for
letters
he
wrote
poor
verses
and
could
not
distinguish
good

from
bad
that
perhaps
was
the
defect
of
geometrique
but
he
wrote
lucid
prose
there
was
an
ironical
side
to
his
temper
and
he
had
an
ingenious
paradoxical
wit
which
he
indulged
with
no
little
felicity
in

curious
fancy

do

confronted
with

the
gourmet
apicius

to
say

ancient
and
modern

touched
on
more
than
once
and
it
is
the
subject
of
the
conversation
between
socrates
and
montaigne
socrates
ironically
professes
to
expect
that
the
age
of
montaigne
will
show
a
vast
improvement
on
his
own
that
men
will
have
profited
by
the
experience
of
many
centuries
and
that
the
old
age
of
the
world
will
be
wiser
and
better
regulated
than
its
youth
montaigne
assures
him
that
it
is
not
so
and
that
the
vigorous
types
of
antiquity
like
pericles
aristides
and
socrates
himself
are
no
longer
to
be
found
to
this
assertion
socrates
opposes
the
doctrine
of

goes
on
to
observe
that
antiquity
is
enlarged
and
exalted
by
distance
in
our
own
day
we
esteemed
our
ancestors
more
than
they
deserved
and
now

for
the
purpose
of
dismissing

as
rather
futile
elsewhere

perrault
they
had
offered
no
proof
and
had
used
the
principle
rather
incidentally
and
by
way
of
illustration
but
the
whole
inquiry
hinged
on
it
if
it
can
be
shown
that
man
has
not
degenerated
the
cause
of
the
moderns
is
practically
won
the
issue
of
the
controversy
must
be
decided
not
by
rhetoric
but
by
physics
and
fontenelle
offers
what
he
regards
as
a
formal
cartesian
proof
of
the
permanence
of
natural
forces
if
the
ancients
had
better
intellects
than
ours
the
brains
of
that
age
must
have
been
better
arranged
formed
of
firmer
or
more
delicate
fibres
fuller
of
animal
spirits
but
if
such
a
difference
existed
nature
must
have
been
more
vigorous
and
in
that
case
the
trees
must
have
profited
by
that
superior
vigour
and
have
been
larger
and
finer
the
truth
is
that
nature
has
in
her
hands
a
certain
paste
which
is
always
the
same
which
she
is
ever
turning
over
and
over
again
in
a
thousand
ways
and
of
which
she
forms
men
animals
and
plants
she
has
not
formed
homer
demosthenes
and
plato
of
a
finer
or
better
kneaded
clay
than
our
poets
orators
and
philosophers
do
not
object
that
minds
are
not
material
they
are
connected
by
a
material
bond
with
the
brain
and
it
is
the
quality
of
this
material
bond
that
determines
intellectual
differences
but
although
natural
processes
do
not
change
from
age
to
age
they
differ
in
their
effects
in
different
climates
it
is
certain
that
as
a
result
of
the
reciprocal
dependence
which
exists
between
all
parts
of
the
material
world
differences
of
climate
which
so
clearly
affect
the
life
of
plants
must
also
produce
some
effect
on
human
brains
may
it
not
be
said
then
that
in
consequence
of
climatic
conditions
ancient
greece
and
rome
produced
men
of
mental
qualities
different
from
those
which
could
be
produced
in
france
oranges
grow
easily
in
italy
it
is
more
difficult
to
cultivate
them
in
france
fontenelle
replies
that
art
and
cultivation
exert
a
much
greater
influence
on
human
brains
than
on
the
soil
ideas
can
be
transported
more
easily
from
one
country
to
another
than
plants
and
as
a
consequence
of
commerce
and
mutual
influence
peoples
do
not
retain
the
original
mental
peculiarities
due
to
climate
this
may
not
be
true
of
the
extreme
climates
in
the
torrid
and
glacial
zones
but
in
the
temperate
zone
we
may
discount
entirely
climatic
influence
the
climates
of
greece
and
italy
and
that
of
france
are
too
similar
to
cause
any
sensible
difference
between
the
greeks
or
latins
and
the
french
saint
sorlin
and
perrault
had
argued
directly
from
the
permanence
of
vigour
in
lions
or
trees
to
the
permanence
of
vigour
in
man
if
trees
are
the
same
as
ever
brains
must
also
be
the
same
but
what
about
the
minor
premiss
who
knows
that
trees
are
precisely
the
same
it
is
an
indemonstrable
assumption
that
oaks
and
beeches
in
the
days
of
socrates
and
cicero
were
not
slightly
better
trees
than
the
oaks
and
beeches
of
fontenelle
saw
the
weakness
of
this
reasoning
he
saw
that
it
was
necessary
to
prove
that
the
trees
no
less
than
human
brains
have
not
degenerated
but
his
a
priori
proof
is
simply
a
statement
of
the
cartesian
principle
of
the
stability
of
natural
processes
which
he
put
in
a
thoroughly
unscientific
form
the
stability
of
the
laws
of
nature
is
a
necessary
hypothesis
without
which
science
would
be
impossible
but
here
it
was
put
to
an
illegitimate
use
for
it
means
that
given
precisely
the
same
conditions
the
same
physical
phenomena
will
occur
fontenelle
therefore
was
bound
to
show
that
conditions
had
not
altered
in
such
a
way
as
to
cause
changes
in
the
quality
of
nature
organic
productions
he
did
not
do
this
he
did
not
take
into
consideration
for
instance
that
climatic
conditions
may
vary
from
age
to
age
as
well
as
from
country
to
country
having
established
the
natural
equality
of
the
ancients
and
moderns
fontenelle
inferred
that
whatever
differences
exist
are
due
to
external
conditions
time
political
institutions
and
the
estate
of
affairs
in
general
the
ancients
were
prior
in
time
to
us
therefore
they
were
the
authors
of
the
first
inventions
for
that
they
can
not
be
regarded
as
our
superiors
if
we
had
been
in
their
place
we
should
have
been
the
inventors
like
them
if
they
were
in
ours
they
would
add
to
those
inventions
like
us
there
is
no
great
mystery
in
that
we
must
impute
equal
merit
to
the
early
thinkers
who
showed
the
way
and
to
the
later
thinkers
who
pursued
it
if
the
ancient
attempts
to
explain
the
universe
have
been
recently
replaced
by
the
discovery
of
a
simple
system
the
cartesian
we
must
consider
that
the
truth
could
only
be
reached
by
the
elimination
of
false
routes
and
in
this
way
the
numbers
of
the
pythagoreans
the
ideas
of
plato
the
qualities
of
aristotle
all
served
indirectly
to
advance
knowledge
we
are
under
an
obligation
to
the
ancients
for
having
exhausted
almost
all
the
false
theories
that
could
be
formed
enlightened
both
by
their
true
views
and
by
their
errors
it
is
not
surprising
that
we
should
surpass
them
but
all
this
applies
only
to
scientific
studies
like
mathematics
physics
and
medicine
which
depend
partly
on
correct
reasoning
and
partly
on
experience
methods
of
reasoning
improve
slowly
and
the
most
important
advance
which
has
been
made
in
the
present
age
is
the
method
inaugurated
by
descartes
before
him
reasoning
was
loose
he
introduced
a
more
rigid
and
precise
standard
and
its
influence
is
not
only
manifest
in
our
best
works
on
physics
and
philosophy
but
is
even
discernible
in
books
on
ethics
and
religion
we
must
expect
posterity
to
excel
us
as
we
excel
the
ancients
through
improvement
of
method
which
is
a
science
in
itself
the
most
difficult
and
least
studied
of
all
and
through
increase
of
experience
evidently
the
process
is
endless
il
est
evident
que
tout
cela
point
de
fin
and
the
latest
men
of
science
must
be
the
most
competent
but
this
does
not
apply
to
poetry
or
eloquence
round
which
the
controversy
has
most
violently
raged
for
poetry
and
eloquence
do
not
depend
on
correct
reasoning
they
depend
principally
on
vivacity
of
imagination
and
vivacity
of
imagination
does
not
require
a
long
course
of
experiments
or
a
great
multitude
of
rules
to
attain
all
the
perfection
of
which
it
is
capable
such
perfection
might
be
attained
in
a
few
centuries
if
the
ancients
did
achieve
perfection
in
imaginative
literature
it
follows
that
they
can
not
be
surpassed
but
we
have
no
right
to
say
as
their
admirers
are
fond
of
pretending
that
they
can
not
be
equalled
besides
the
mere
nature
of
time
we
have
to
take
into
account
external
circumstances
in
considering
this
question
if
the
forces
of
nature
are
permanent
how
are
we
to
explain
the
fact
that
in
the
barbarous
centuries
after
the
decline
of
rome
the
term
middle
ages
has
not
yet
come
into
currency
ignorance
was
so
dense
and
deep
this
breach
of
continuity
is
one
of
the
plausible
arguments
of
the
advocates
of
the
ancients
those
ages
they
say
were
ignorant
and
barbarous
because
the
greek
and
latin
writers
had
ceased
to
be
read
as
soon
as
the
study
of
the
classical
models
revived
there
was
a
renaissance
of
reason
and
good
taste
that
is
true
but
it
proves
nothing
nature
never
forgot
how
to
mould
the
head
of
cicero
or
livy
she
produces
in
every
age
men
who
might
be
great
men
but
the
age
does
not
always
allow
them
to
exert
their
talents
inundations
of
barbarians
universal
wars
governments
which
discourage
or
do
not
favour
science
and
art
prejudices
which
assume
all
variety
of
shapes
like
the
chinese
prejudice
against
dissecting
corpses
may
impose
long
periods
of
ignorance
or
bad
taste
but
observe
that
though
the
return
to
the
study
of
the
ancients
revived
as
at
one
stroke
the
aesthetic
ideals
which
they
had
created
and
the
learning
which
they
had
accumulated
yet
even
if
their
works
had
not
been
preserved
we
should
though
it
would
have
cost
us
many
long
years
of
labour
have
discovered
for
ourselves
ideas
of
the
true
and
the
beautiful
where
should
we
have
found
them
where
the
ancients
themselves
found
them
after
much
groping
the
comparison
of
the
life
of
collective
humanity
to
the
life
of
a
single
man
which
had
been
drawn
by
bacon
and
pascal
saint
sorlin
and
perrault
contains
or
illustrates
an
important
truth
which
bears
on
the
whole
question
fontenelle
puts
it
thus
an
educated
mind
is
as
it
were
composed
of
all
the
minds
of
preceding
ages
we
might
say
that
a
single
mind
was
being
educated
throughout
all
history
thus
this
secular
man
who
has
lived
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
has
had
his
infancy
in
which
he
was
absorbed
by
the
most
urgent
needs
of
life
his
youth
in
which
he
succeeded
pretty
well
in
things
of
imagination
like
poetry
and
eloquence
and
even
began
to
reason
but
with
more
courage
than
solidity
he
is
now
in
the
age
of
manhood
is
more
enlightened
and
reasons
better
but
he
would
have
advanced
further
if
the
passion
for
war
had
not
distracted
him
and
given
him
a
distaste
for
the
sciences
to
which
he
has
at
last
returned
figures
if
they
are
pressed
are
dangerous
they
suggest
unwarrantable
conclusions
it
may
be
illuminative
to
liken
the
development
of
humanity
to
the
growth
of
an
individual
but
to
infer
that
the
human
race
is
now
in
its
old
age
merely
on
the
strength
of
the
comparison
is
obviously
unjustifiable
that
is
what
bacon
and
the
others
had
done
the
fallacy
was
pointed
out
by
fontenelle
from
his
point
of
view
an
old
age
of
humanity
which
if
it
meant
anything
meant
decay
as
well
as
the
wisdom
of
experience
was
contrary
to
the
principle
of
the
permanence
of
natural
forces
man
he
asserts
will
have
no
old
age
he
will
be
always
equally
capable
of
achieving
the
successes
of
his
youth
and
he
will
become
more
and
more
expert
in
the
things
which
become
the
age
of
virility
or
to
drop
metaphor
men
will
never
degenerate
in
ages
to
come
we
may
be
regarded
say
in
america
with
the
same
excess
of
admiration
with
which
we
regard
the
ancients
we
might
push
the
prediction
further
in
still
later
ages
the
interval
of
time
which
divides
us
from
the
greeks
and
romans
will
appear
so
relatively
small
to
posterity
that
they
will
classify
us
and
the
ancients
as
virtually
contemporary
just
in
the
same
way
as
we
group
together
the
greeks
and
romans
though
the
romans
in
their
own
day
were
moderns
in
relation
to
the
greeks
in
that
remote
period
men
will
be
able
to
judge
without
prejudice
the
comparative
merits
of
sophocles
and
corneille
unreasonable
admiration
for
the
ancients
is
one
of
the
chief
obstacles
to
progress
le
progres
des
choses
philosophy
not
only
did
not
advance
but
even
fell
into
an
abyss
of
unintelligible
ideas
because
through
devotion
to
the
authority
of
aristotle
men
sought
truth
in
his
enigmatic
writings
instead
of
seeking
it
in
nature
if
the
authority
of
descartes
were
ever
to
have
the
same
fortune
the
results
would
be
no
less
disastrous
this
memorable
brochure
exhibits
without
pedantry
perspicuous
arrangement
and
the
geometrical
precision
on
which
fontenelle
remarked
as
one
of
the
notes
of
the
new
epoch
introduced
by
descartes
it
displays
too
the
author
and
his
readiness
to
follow
where
the
argument
leads
he
is
able
already
to
look
beyond
cartesianism
he
knows
that
it
can
not
be
final
no
man
of
his
time
was
more
and
free
from
prejudice
than
fontenelle
this
quality
of
mind
helped
him
to
turn
his
eyes
to
the
future
perrault
and
his
predecessors
were
absorbed
in
the
interest
of
the
present
and
the
past
descartes
was
too
much
engaged
in
his
own
original
discoveries
to
do
more
than
throw
a
passing
glance
at
posterity
now
the
prospect
of
the
future
was
one
of
the
two
elements
which
were
still
needed
to
fashion
the
theory
of
the
progress
of
knowledge
all
the
conditions
for
such
a
theory
were
present
bodin
and
bacon
descartes
and
the
champions
of
the
moderns
the
reaction
against
the
renaissance
and
the
startling
discoveries
of
science
had
prepared
the
way
progress
was
established
for
the
past
and
present
but
the
theory
of
the
progress
of
knowledge
includes
and
acquires
its
value
by
including
the
indefinite
future
this
step
was
taken
by
fontenelle
the
idea
had
been
almost
excluded
by
bacon
misleading
metaphor
of
old
age
which
fontenelle
expressly
rejects
man
will
have
no
old
age
his
intellect
will
never
degenerate
and
the
sound
views
of
intellectual
men
in
successive
generations
will
continually
add
up
but
progress
must
not
only
be
conceived
as
extending
indefinitely
into
the
future
it
must
also
be
conceived
as
necessary
and
certain
this
is
the
second
essential
feature
of
the
theory
the
theory
would
have
little
value
or
significance
if
the
prospect
of
progress
in
the
future
depended
on
chance
or
the
unpredictable
discretion
of
an
external
will
fontenelle
asserts
implicitly
the
certainty
of
progress
when
he
declares
that
the
discoveries
and
improvements
of
the
modern
age
would
have
been
made
by
the
ancients
if
they
exchanged
places
with
the
moderns
for
this
amounts
to
saying
that
science
will
progress
and
knowledge
increase
independently
of
particular
individuals
if
descartes
had
not
been
born
some
one
else
would
have
done
his
work
and
there
could
have
been
no
descartes
before
the
seventeenth
century
for
as
he
says
in
a
later
work
footnote

is
an
order

certain
number
of
preceding
sciences
have
developed
and
only
then
it
has
to
await
its
turn
to
burst
its
shell
fontenelle
then
was
the
first
to
formulate
the
idea
of
the
progress
of
knowledge
as
a
complete
doctrine
at
the
moment
the
import
and
effects
of
the
idea
were
not
realised
either
by
himself
or
by
others
and
his
pamphlet
which
appeared
in
the
company
of
a
perverse
theory
of
pastoral
poetry
was
acclaimed
merely
as
an
able
defence
of
the
moderns
if
the
theory
of
the
indefinite
progress
of
knowledge
is
true
it
is
one
of
those
truths
which
were
originally
established
by
false
reasoning
it
was
established
on
a
principle
which
excluded
degeneration
but
equally
excluded
evolution
and
the
whole
conception
of
nature
which
fontenelle
had
learned
from
descartes
is
long
since
dead
and
buried
but
it
is
more
important
to
observe
that
this
principle
which
seemed
to
secure
the
indefinite
progress
of
knowledge
disabled
fontenelle
from
suggesting
a
theory
of
the
progress
of
society
the
invariability
of
nature
as
he
conceived
it
was
true
of
the
emotions
and
the
will
as
well
as
of
the
intellect
it
implied
that
man
himself
would
be

no

it
is
little
more
than
a
veneer
even
if
theory
had
not
stood
in
his
way
fontenelle
was
the
last
man
who
was
likely
to
dream
dreams
of
social
improvement
he
was
temperamentally
an
epicurean
of
the
same
refined
stamp
as
epicurus
himself
and
he
enjoyed
throughout
his
long
life
he
lived
to
the
age
of
a
hundred
the
tranquillity
which
was
the
true
epicurean
ideal
he
was
never
troubled
by
domestic
cares

his
own
modest
ambition
was
satisfied

at
the
age

forty

him
only
so
far
as
they

it
remains
however
noteworthy
that
the
author
of
the
theory
of
the

of
knowledge
which
was
afterwards
to
expand
into
a
general
theory
of
human
progress
would
not

was
legitimate
though
it
was
through
this
extension
that
fontenelle
idea
acquired
human
value
and
interest
and
became
a
force
in

fontenelle
did
a
good
deal
more
than
formulate
the
idea
he
reinforced
it
by
showing
that
the
prospect
of
a
steady
and
rapid
increase
of
knowledge
in
the
future
was
certified
the
postulate
of
the
immutability

has

the
indispensable
basis
for
the
advance

science
is
fundamental
with
descartes
but
descartes
did
not
explicitly
insist
on
it
and
it
was
fontenelle
perhaps
more
than
any
one
else
who
made
it
current
coin
that
was
a
service
performed
by
the
disciple
but
he
seems
to
have
been
original
in
introducing
the
fruitful
idea

as
confederate

interconnected

constituting

the

exposed
with

ability
the
reciprocal
relations
of

had
a

comprehensive
view
of

though
he
made
no
original
contributions
to
any
his
curiosity
was
universal
and
as
secretary
of
the
academy
he
was
obliged
according
to
his
own
high
standard
of
his
duty
to
keep
abreast
of
all
that
was
being
done
in
every
branch
of
knowledge
that
was
possible
then
it
would
be
impossible
now
in
the
famous
series
of
obituary
discourses
which
he
delivered
on
savants
who
were
members
of
the
academy
fontenelle
probably
thought
that
he
was
contributing
to
the
realisation
of
this
ideal
of
solidarity
for
they
amounted
to
a
chronicle
of
scientific
progress
in
every
department
they
are
free
from
technicalities
and
extraordinarily
lucid
and
they
appealed
not
only
to
men
of
science
but
to
those
of
the
educated
public
who
possessed
some
scientific
curiosity
this
brings
us
to
another
important
role
of
fontenelle
the
role
of
interpreter
of
the
world
of
science
to
the
world
outside
it
is
closely
related
to
our
subject
for
the
popularisation
of
science
which
was
to
be
one
of
the
features
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
in
fact
a
condition
of
the
success
of
the
idea
of
progress
that
idea
could
not
insinuate
itself
into
the
public
mind
and
become
a
living
force
in
civilised
societies
until
the
meaning
and
value
of
science
had
been
generally
grasped
and
the
results
of
scientific
discovery
had
been
more
or
less
diffused
the
achievements
of
physical
science
did
more
than
anything
else
to
convert
the
imaginations
of

to
the

the

of

had
hardly
escaped

began
to

between

thinkers
of

and
the
characteristic
thinkers
of

is
a
period
of
over
sixty
years

writing
long
before

works

begin
with
the
esprit

in
the
intellectual
task
of
this
intervening
period
was
to
turn
to
account
the
ideas
provided
by
the
philosophy
of
descartes
and
use
them
as
solvents
of
the
ideas
handed
down
from
the
middle
ages
we
might
almost
call
it
the
cartesian
period
for
though
descartes
was
dead
it
was
in
these
years
that
cartesianism
performed
its
task
and
transformed
human
thought
when
we
speak
of
cartesianism
we
do
not
mean
the
metaphysical
system
of
the
master
or
any
of
his
particular
views
such
as
that
of
innate
ideas
we
mean
the
general
principles
which
were
to
leave
an

fontenelle
was
far
from
accepting
all
the
views
of
descartes
whom
he
does
not
scruple
to
criticise
but
he
was
a
true
cartesian
in
the
sense
that
he
was
deeply
imbued
with
these
principles

generated

use
an
expression

these

probably
did
more
than
any

man
to
exhibit
the
consequences
of
the
cartesian
ideas
and
drive
them
home
the
plurality
of
worlds
was
a
contribution
to
the
task
of
transforming
thought
and
abolishing
ancient
error
but
the
history
of
oracles
which
appeared
in
the
following
year
was
more
characteristic
it
was
a
free
adaptation
of
an
unreadable
latin
treatise
by
a
dutchman
which
in
fontenelle
skilful
hands
becomes
a
vehicle
for
applying
cartesian
solvents
to
theological
authority
the
thesis
is
that
the
greek
oracles
were
a
sacerdotal
imposture
and
not
as
ecclesiastical
tradition
said
the
work
of
evil
spirits
who
were
stricken
silent
at
the
death
of
jesus
christ
the
effect
was
to
discredit
the
authority
of
the
early
fathers
of
the
church
though
the
writer
has
the
discretion
to
repudiate
such
an
intention
for
the
publication
was
risky
and
twenty
years
later
a
jesuit
father
wrote
a
treatise
to
confute
it
and
exposed
the
secret
poison
with
consequences
which
might
have
been
disastrous
for
fontenelle
if
he
had
not
had
powerful
friends
among
the
jesuits
themselves
fontenelle
had
none
of
the
impetuosity
of
voltaire
and
after
the
publication
of
the
history
of
oracles
he
confined
his
criticism
of
tradition
to
the
field
of

he
was

exception
of
fontenelle
and
in
knowledge
of
antiquity
he
was
fontenelle
superior
his
inquiry
stands
out
as
the
most
sensible
and
unprejudiced
contribution
to
the
whole
debate
he
accepts
as
just
the
reasoning
of
fontenelle
as
to
the
comparative
force
of
the
geniuses
of
men
in
the
several
ages
of
the
world
and
of
the
equal
force
of
men
understandings
absolutely
considered
in
all
times
since
learning
first
began
to
be
cultivated
amongst
mankind
but
this
is
not
incompatible
with
the
thesis
that
in
some
branches
the
ancients
excelled
all
who
came
after
them
for
it
is
not
necessary
to
explain
such
excellence
by
the
hypothesis
that
there
was
a
particular
force
of
genius
evidently
discernible
in
former
ages
but
extinct
long
since
and
that
nature
is
now
worn
out
and
spent
there
is
an
alternative
explanation
there
may
have
been
special
circumstances
which
might
suit
with
those
ages
which
did
exceed
ours
and
with
those
things
wherein
they
did
exceed
us
and
with
no
other
age
nor
thing
besides
but
we
must
begin
our
inquiry
by
sharply
distinguishing
two
fields
of
mental
activity
the
field
of
art
including
poetry
oratory
architecture
painting
and
statuary
and
the
field
of
knowledge
including
mathematics
natural
science
physiology
with
all
their
dependencies
in
the
case
of
the
first
group
there
is
room
for
variety
of
opinion
but
the
superiority
of
the
greeks
and
romans
in
poetry
and
literary
style
may
be
admitted
without
prejudice
to
the
mental
equality
of
the
moderns
for
it
may
be
explained
partly
by
the
genius
of
their
languages
and
partly
by
political
circumstances
for
example
in
the
case
of
oratory
footnote
this
had
been
noted
by
fontenelle
in
his
digression
by
the
practical
necessity
of
eloquence
but
as
regards
the
other
group
knowledge
is
not
a
matter
of
opinion
or
taste
and
a
definite
judgement
is
possible
wotton
then
proceeds
to
review
systematically
the
field
of
science
and
easily
shows
with
more
completeness
and
precision
than
perrault
the
superiority
of
modern
methods
and
the
enormous
strides
which
had
been
made
as
to
the
future
wotton
expresses
himself
cautiously
it
is
not
easy
to
say
whether
knowledge
will
advance
in
the
next
age
proportionally
to
its
advance
in
this
he
has
some
fears
that
there
may
be
a
falling
away
because
ancient
learning
has
still
too
great
a
hold
over
modern
books
and
physical
and
mathematical
studies
tend
to
be
neglected
but
he
ends
his
reflexions
by
the
speculation
that
some
future
age
though
perhaps
not
the
next
and
in
a
country
now
possibly
little
thought
of
may
do
that
which
our
great
men
would
be
glad
to
see
done
that
is
to
say
may
raise
real
knowledge
upon
foundations
laid
in
this
age
to
the
utmost
possible
perfection
to
which
it
may
be
brought
by
mortal
men
in
this
imperfect
state
the
distinction
on
which
wotton
insisted
between
the
sciences
which
require
ages
for
their
development
and
the
imaginative
arts
which
may
reach
perfection
in
a
short
time
had
been
recognised
by
fontenelle
whose
argument
on
this
point
differs
from
that
of
his
friend
perrault
for
perrault
contended
that
in
literature
and
art
as
well
as
in
science
later
generations
can
through
the
advantage
of
time
and
longer
experience
attain
to
a
higher
excellence
than
their
predecessors
fontenelle
on
the
other
hand
held
that
poetry
and
eloquence
have
a
restricted
field
and
that
therefore
there
must
be
a
time
at
which
they
reach
a
point
of
excellence
which
can
not
be
exceeded
it
was
his
personal
opinion
that
eloquence
and
history
actually
reached
the
highest
possible
perfection
in
cicero
and
livy
but
neither
fontenelle
nor
wotton
came
into
close
quarters
with
the
problem
which
was
raised
not
very
clearly
it
is
true
by
perrault
is
there
development
in
the
various
species
of
literature
and
art
do
they
profit
and
enrich
themselves
by
the
general
advance
of
civilisation
perrault
as
we
have
seen
threw
out
the
suggestion
that
increased
experience
and
psychological
study
enabled
the
moderns
to
penetrate
more
deeply
into
the
recesses
of
the
human
soul
and
therefore
to
bring
to
a
higher
perfection
the
treatment
of
the
character
motives
and
passions
of
men
this
suggestion
admits
of
being
extended
in
the
introduction
to
his
revolt
of
islam
shelley
describing
his
own
intellectual
and
aesthetic
experiences
writes
the
poetry
of
ancient
greece
and
rome
and
modern
italy
and
our
own
country
has
been
to
me
like
external
nature
a
passion
and
an
enjoyment
i
have
considered
poetry
in
its
most
comprehensive
sense
and
have
read
the
poets
and
the
historians
and
the
metaphysicians
whose
writings
have
been
accessible
to
me
and
have
looked
upon
the
beautiful
and
majestic
scenery
of
the
earth
as
common
sources
of
those
elements
which
it
is
the
province
of
the
poet
to
embody
and
combine
and
he
appends
a
note
in
this
sense
there
may
be
such
a
thing
as
perfectibility
in
works
of
fiction
notwithstanding
the
concession
often
made
by
the
advocates
of
human
improvement
that
perfectibility
is
a
term
applicable
only
to
science
in
other
words
all
the
increases
of
human
experience
from
age
to
age
all
the
speculative
adventures
of
the
intellect
provide
the
artist
in
each
succeeding
generation
with
more
abundant
sources
for
aesthetic
treatment
as
years
go
on
life
in
its
widest
sense
offers
more
and
more
materials
which
it
is
the
province
of
the
poet
to
embody
and
combine
this
is
evidently
true
and
would
it
not
seem
to
follow
that
literature
is
not
excluded
from
participating
in
the
common
development
of
civilisation
one
of
the
latest
of
the
champions
of
the

the

maintained

progress

expedient

was
not

for
the
question
was
as
we
shall
see
raised
anew
by
madame

and
the
theory
was
finally
to
emerge
that

and
institutions
are
an
expression
of
society
and
therefore
inextricably
linked
with
the
other
elements
of

theory
it
may
be
observed
which
while
it
has
discredited
the
habit
of
considering

in
a
vacuum
dateless
and
detached
as
they
were
generally

where

to

would
have
served
to
bring

into

general
field
of
human
development
without
compromising
the
distinction
on
which
wotton
and
others
insisted
between
the
natural
sciences
and
the
aesthetic
arts
but
that
distinction
emphatically
endorsed
by
voltaire
had
the
effect
of
excluding
literature
and
art
from
the
view
of
those
who
in
the
eighteenth
century
recognised
progress
in
the
other
activities
of
man
it
is
notable
that
in
this
literary
controversy
the
moderns
even
fontenelle
seem
curiously
negligent
of
the
import
of
the
theory
which
they
were
propounding
of
the

progress
of

they
treat
it
almost
incidentally
as

as

the
obscurantism
of

to
concentrate
their

to
turn
the

on
the
nature

they
wrought
with
unscrupulous
resolution
and
with
effects
with
the
extension
of
rationalism
into
the
social

it
came
about
naturally
that
the
idea

intellectual
progress
was
enlarged
into
the
idea
of
the
general
progress

the
transition
was
easy

neither

the

will
be
the
arrival
of
that
beautiful

the
ancient

promise

rolled

they

it

that

it
depends

on

this

brilliancy
of

to

it
was
in
the
course
of
the
great
struggle
of
the
spanish
succession
that
he
turned
his
attention
to
war
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
an
unnecessary
evil
and
even
an
absurdity
in
he
attended
the
congress
at
utrecht
in
the
capacity
of
secretary
to
cardinal
de
polignac
one
of

delegates
his
experiences
there
confirmed
his
optimistic
mind
in
the
persuasion
that
perpetual
peace
was
an
aim
which
might
readily
be
realised
and
in
the
following

he
published
the
memoir

ignoring
the

was
to
eliminate

made
it
the

of

to
guarantee
to

another
the
preservation
of

it
is
not
to
our
present
purpose
to
comment
on
this
plan
which
the
author
with
his
characteristic
simplicity
seriously
pressed
upon
the
attention
of
statesmen
it
is
easy
to
criticise
it
in
the
light
of
subsequent
history
and
to
see
that
if
the
impossible
had
happened
and
the
experiment
had
been
tried
and
succeeded
it
might
have
caused
more
suffering
than
all
the
wars
from
that
day
to
this
for
it
was
based
on
a
perpetuation
of
the
political
status
quo
in
europe
it
assumed
that
the
existing
political
distribution
of
power
was
perfectly
satisfactory
and
conformable
to
the
best
interests
of
all
the
peoples
concerned
it
would
have
hindered
the
partition
of
poland
but
it
would
have
maintained
the
austrian
oppression
of
italians
the
project
also
secured
to
the
sovrans
the
heritage
of
their
authority
and
guarded
against
civil
wars
this
assumed
that
the
various
existing
constitutions
were
fundamentally
just
the
realisation
of
the
scheme
would
have
perpetuated
all
the
evils
of
autocratic
governments
its
author
did
not
perceive
that
the
radical
evil
in
france
was
irresponsible
power
it
needed
the
reign
of
louis
xv
and
the
failure
of
attempts
at
reform
under
his
successor
to
bring
this
home
the
abbe
even
thought
that
an
increase
of
the
despotic
authority
of
the
government
was
desirable
provided
this
were
accompanied
by
an
increase
in
the
enlightenment
and
virtue
of
its
ministers
in
he
published
an
abridgment
of
his
scheme
and
here
he
looks
beyond
its
immediate
results
to
its
value
for
distant
posterity
no
one
he
says
can
imagine
or
foresee
the
advantages
which
such
an
alliance
of
european
states
will
yield
to
europe
five
hundred
years
after
its
establishment
now
we
can
see
the
first
beginnings
but
it
is
beyond
the
powers
of
the
human
mind
to
discern
its
infinite
effects
in
the
future
it
may
produce
results
more
precious
than
anything
hitherto
experienced
by
man
he
supports
his
argument
by
observing
that
our
primitive
ancestors
could
not
foresee
the
improvements
which
the
course
of
ages
would
bring
in
their
rudimentary
arrangements
for
securing
social
order
it
is
characteristic
that
the
abbe
de
ideas
about
progress
were
a
of
his
particular
schemes
in
he
published
a
project
to
perfect
the
government
of
states
and
here
he
sketched
his
view
of
the
progressive
course
of
civilisation
the
old
legend
of
the
golden
age
when
men
were
perfectly
happy
succeeded
by
the
ages
of
silver
bronze
and
iron
exactly
reverses
the
truth
of
history
the
age
of
iron
came
first
the
infancy
of
society
when
men
were
poor
and
ignorant
of
the
arts
it
is
the
present
condition
of
the
savages
of
africa
and
america
the
age
of
bronze
ensued
in
which
there
was
more
security
better
laws
and
the
invention
of
the
most
necessary
arts
began
there
followed
the
age
of
silver
and
europe
has
not
yet
emerged
from
it
our
reason
has
indeed
reached
the
point
of
considering
how
war
may
be
abolished
and
is
thus
approaching
the
golden
age
of
the
future
but
the
art
of
government
and
the
general
regulation
of
society
notwithstanding
all
the
improvements
of
the
past
is
still
in
its
infancy
yet
all
that
is
needed
is
a
short
series
of
wise
reigns
in
our
european
states
to
reach
the
age
of
gold
or
in
other
words
a
paradise
on
earth
a
few
wise
reigns
the
abbe
shared
the
illusion
of
many
that
government
is
omnipotent
and
can
bestow
happiness
on
men
the
imperfections
of
governments
were
he
was
convinced
chiefly
due
to
the
fact
that
hitherto
the
ablest
intellects
had
not
been
dedicated
to
the
study
of
the
science
of
governing
the
most
essential
part
of
his
project
was
the
formation
of
a
political
academy
which
should
do
for
politics
what
the
academy
of
sciences
did
for
the
study
of
nature
and
should
act
as
an
advisory
body
to
ministers
of
state
on
all
questions
of
the
public
welfare
if
this
proposal
and
some
others
were
adopted
he
believed
that
the
golden
age
would
not
long
be
delayed
these
observations
hardly
more
than
obiter
dicta
show
that
general
view
of
the
world
was
moulded
by
a
conception
of
civilisation
progressing
towards
a
goal
of
human
happiness
in
he
published
a
special
work
to
explain
this
conception
the
observations
on
the
continuous
progress
of
universal
reason
he
recurs
to
the
comparison
of
the
life
of
collective
humanity
to
that
of
an
individual
and
like
fontenelle
and
terrasson
accentuates
the
point
where
the
analogy
fails
we
may
regard
our
race
as
composed
of
all
the
nations
that
have
been
and
will
be
and
assign
to
it
different
ages
for
instance
when
the
race
is
ten
thousand
years
old
a
century
will
be
what
a
single
year
is
in
the
life
of
a
centenarian
but
there
is
this
prodigious
difference
the
mortal
man
grows
old
and
loses
his
reason
and
happiness
through
the
enfeeblement
of
his
bodily
machine
whereas
the
human
race
by
the
perpetual
and
infinite
succession
of
generations
will
find
itself
at
the
end
of
ten
thousand
years
more
capable
of
growing
in
wisdom
and
happiness
than
it
was
at
the
end
of
four
thousand
at
present
the
race
is
apparently
not
more
than
seven
or
eight
thousand
years
old
and
is
only
in
the
infancy
of
human
reason
compared
with
what
it
will
be
five
or
six
thousand
years
hence
and
when
that
stage
is
reached
it
will
only
have
entered
on
what
we
may
call
its
first
youth
when
we
consider
what
it
will
be
when
it
is
a
hundred
thousand
years
older
still
continually
growing
in
reason
and
wisdom
here
we
have
for
the
first
time
expressed
in
definite
terms
the
vista
of
an
immensely
long
progressive
life
in
front
of
humanity
civilisation
is
only
in
its
infancy
bacon
like
pascal
had
conceived
it
to
be
in
its
old
age
fontenelle
and
perrault
seem
to
have
regarded
it
as
in
its
virility
they
set
no
term
to
its
duration
but
they
did
not
dwell
on
future
prospects
the
abbe
was
the
first
to
fix
his
eye
on
the
remote
destinies
of
the
race
and
name
immense
periods
of
time
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
consider
that
our
destinies
are
bound
up
with
those
of
the
solar
system
and
that
it
is
useless
to
operate
with
millennial
periods
of
progress
unless
you
are
assured
of
a
corresponding
stability
in
the
cosmic
environment
as
a
test
of
the
progress
which
reason
has
already
made
asserts
that
a
comparison
of
the
best
english
and
french
works
on
morals
and
politics
with
the
best
works
of
plato
and
aristotle
proves
that
the
human
race
has
made
a
sensible
advance
but
that
advance
would
have
been
infinitely
greater
were
it
not
that
three
general
obstacles
retarded
it
and
even
at
some
times
and
in
some
countries
caused
a
retrogression
these
obstacles
were
wars
superstition
and
the
jealousy
of
rulers
who
feared
that
progress
in
the
science
of
politics
would
be
dangerous
to
themselves
in
consequence
of
these
impediments
it
was
only
in
the
time
of
bodin
and
bacon
that
the
human
race
began
to
start
anew
from
the
point
which
it
had
reached
in
the
days
of
plato
and
aristotle
since
then
the
rate
of
progress
has
been
accelerated
and
this
has
been
due
to
several
causes
the
expansion
of
sea
commerce
has
produced
more
wealth
and
wealth
means
greater
leisure
and
more
writers
and
readers
in
the
second
place
mathematics
and
physics
are
more
studied
in
colleges
and
their
tendency
is
to
liberate
us
from
subjection
to
the
authority
of
the
ancients
again
the
foundation
of
scientific
academies
has
given
facilities
both
for
communicating
and
for
correcting
new
discoveries
the
art
of
printing
provides
a
means
for
diffusing
them
and
finally
the
habit
of
writing
in
the
vulgar
tongue
makes
them
accessible
the
author
might
also
have
referred
to
the
modern
efforts
to
popularise
science
in
which
his
friend
fontenelle
had
been
one
of
the
leaders
he
proceeds
in
this
connection
to
lay
down
a
rather
doubtful
principle
that
in
any
two
countries
the
difference
in
enlightenment
between
the
lowest
classes
will
correspond
to
the
difference
between
the
most
highly
educated
classes
at
present
he
says
paris
and
london
are
the
places
where
human
wisdom
has
reached
the
most
advanced
stage
it
is
certain
that
the
ten
best
men
of
the
highest
class
at
ispahan
or
constantinople
will
be
inferior
in
their
knowledge
of
politics
and
ethics
to
the
ten
most
distinguished
sages
of
paris
or
london
and
this
will
be
true
in
all
classes
the
thirty
most
intelligent
children
of
the
age
of
fourteen
at
paris
will
be
more
enlightened
than
the
thirty
most
intelligent
children
of
the
same
age
at
constantinople
and
the
same
proportional
difference
will
be
true
of
the
lowest
classes
of
the
two
cities
but
while
the
progress
of
speculative
reason
has
been
rapid
practical
reason
the
distinction
is
the
abbe
has
made
little
advance
in
point
of
morals
and
general
happiness
the
world
is
apparently
much
the
same
as
ever
our
mediocre
savants
know
twenty
times
as
much
as
socrates
and
confucius
but
our
most
virtuous
men
are
not
more
virtuous
than
they
the
growth
of
science
has
added
much
to
the
arts
and
conveniences
of
life
and
to
the
sum
of
pleasures
and
will
add
more
the
progress
in
physical
science
is
part
of
the
progress
of
the
universal
human
reason
whose
aim
is
the
augmentation
of
our
happiness
but
there
are
two
other
sciences
which
are
much
more
important
for
the
promotion
of
happiness
ethics
and
politics
and
these
neglected
by
men
of
genius
have
made
little
way
in
the
course
of
two
thousand
years
it
is
a
grave
misfortune
that
descartes
and
newton
did
not
devote
themselves
to
perfecting
these
sciences
so
incomparably
more
useful
for
mankind
than
those
in
which
they
made
their
great
discoveries
they
fell
into
a
prevailing
error
as
to
the
comparative
values
of
the
various
domains
of
knowledge
an
error
to
which
we
must
also
ascribe
the
fact
that
while
academies
of
sciences
and
exist
there
are
no
such
institutions
for
politics
or
ethics
by
these
arguments
he
establishes
to
his
own
satisfaction
that
there
are
no
irremovable
obstacles
to
the
progress
of
the
human
race
towards
happiness
no
hindrances
that
could
not
be
overcome
if
governments

saw

to
eye

is
already
on
the
decline
there
would
be
no
more
wars
if
his
simple
scheme
for
permanent
peace
were
adopted
let
the
state
immediately
found
political
and
ethical
academies
let
the
ablest
men
consecrate
their
talents
to
the
science
of
government
and
in
a
hundred
years
we
shall
make
more
progress
than
we
should
make
in
two
thousand
at
the
rate
we
are
moving
if
these
things
are
done
human
reason
will
have
advanced
so
far
in
two
or
three
millenniums
that
the
wisest
men
of
that
age
will
be
as
far
superior
to
the
wisest
of
as
these
are
to
the
wisest
african
savages
this
perpetual
and
unlimited
augmentation
of
reason
will
one
day
produce
an
increase
in
human
happiness
which
would
astonish
us
more
than
our
own
civilisation
would
astonish
the
kaffirs
the
abbe
de
was
indeed
terribly
at
ease
in
confronting
the
deepest
and
most
complex
problems
which
challenge
the
intellect
of
man
he
had
no
notion
of
their
depth
and
complexity
and
he
lightly
essayed
them
treating
human
nature
as
if
it
were
an
abstraction
by
a
method
which
he
would
doubtless
have
described
as
cartesian
he
was
simply
operating
with
the
ideas
which
were
all
round
him
in
a
society
saturated
with
cartesianism
supremacy
of
human
reason
progressive
enlightenment
the
value
of
this
life
for
its
own
sake
and
the
standard
of
utility
given
these
ideas
and
the
particular
bias
of
his
own
mind
it
required
no
great
ingenuity
to
advance
from
the
thought
of
the
progress
of
science
to
the
thought
of
progress
in
man
moral
nature
and
his
social
conditions
the
omnipotence
of
governments
to
mould
the
destinies
of
peoples
the
possibility
of
the
creation
of
enlightened
governments
and
the
indefinite
progress
of
enlightenment
all
articles
of
his
belief
were
the
terms
of
an
argument
of
the
sorites
form
which
it
was
a
simple
matter
to
develop
in
his
brief
treatise
but
we
must
not
do
him
injustice
he
was
a
much
more
considerable
thinker
than
posterity
for
a
long
time
was
willing
to
believe
it
is
easy
to
ridicule
some
of
his
projets
and
dismiss
him
as
a
crank
who
was
also
somewhat
of
a
bore
the
truth
however
is
that
many
of
his
schemes
were
sound
and
valuable
his
economic
ideas
which
he
thought
out
for
himself
were
in
advance
of
his
time
and
he
has
even
been
described
by
a
recent
writer
as
un
contemporain
egare
au
xviii
siecle
some
of
his
financial
proposals
were
put
into
practice
by
turgot
but
his
significance
in
the
development
of
the
revolutionary
ideas
which
were
to
gain
control
in
the
second
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
has
hardly
been
appreciated
yet
and
it
was
imperfectly
appreciated
by
his
contemporaries
it
is
easy
to
see
why
his
theories
are
buried
in
his
multitudinous
projets
if
instead
of
working
out
the
details
of
endless
particular
reforms
he
had
built
up
general
theories
of
government
and
society
economics
and
education
they
might
have
had
no
more
intrinsic
value
but
he
would
have
been
recognised
as
the
precursor
of
the
encyclopaedists
for
his
principles
are
theirs
the
omnipotence
of
government
and
laws
to
mould
the
morals
of
peoples
the
subordination
of
all
knowledge
to
the
goddess
of
utility
the
deification
of
human
reason
and
the
doctrine
of
progress
his
crude
utilitarianism
led
him
to
depreciate
the
study
of
mathematical
and
physical
sciences
notwithstanding
his
veneration
for
descartes
as
comparatively
useless
and
he
despised
the
fine
arts
as
waste
of
time
and
toil
which
might
be
better
spent
he
had
no
knowledge
of
natural
science
and
he
had
no
artistic
susceptibility
the
philosophers
of
the
encyclopaedia
did
not
go
so
far
but
they
tended
in
this
direction
they
were
cold
and
indifferent
towards
speculative
science
and
they
were
inclined
to
set
higher
value
on
artisans
than
on
artists
in
his
religious
ideas
the
abbe
differed
from
voltaire
and
the
later
social
philosophers
in
one
important
respect
but
this
very
difference
was
a
consequence
of
his
utilitarianism
like
them
he
was
a
deist
as
we
saw
he
had
imbibed
the
spirit
of
bayle
and
the
doctrine
of
the
english
rationalists
which
were
penetrating
french
society
during
the
later
part
of
his
life
his
god
however
was
more
than
the
creator
and
organiser
of
the
encyclopaedists
he
was
also
the
dieu
vengeur
et
remunerateur
in
whom
voltaire
believed
but
here
his
faith
was
larger
than
voltaire
for
while
voltaire
referred
the
punishments
and
rewards
to
this
life
the
abbe
believed
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
in
heaven
and
hell
he
acknowledged
that
immortality
could
not
be
demonstrated
that
it
was
only
probable
but
he
clung
to
it
firmly
and
even
intolerantly
it
is
clear
from
his
writings
that
his
affection
for
this
doctrine
was
due
to
its
utility
as
an
auxiliary
to
the
magistrate
and
the
tutor
and
also
to
the
consideration
that
paradise
would
add
to
the
total
of
human
happiness
but
though
his
religion
had
more
articles
he
was
as
determined
a
foe
of
superstition
as
voltaire
diderot
and
the
rest
he
did
not
go
so
far
as
they
in
aggressive
rationalism
he
belonged
to
an
older
generation
but
his
principles
were
the
same
the
abbe
de
thus
represents
the
transition
from
the
earlier
cartesianism
which
was
occupied
with
purely
intellectual
problems
to
the
later
thought
of
the
eighteenth
century
which
concentrated
itself
on
social
problems
he
anticipated
the
humanistic
spirit
of
the
encyclopaedists
who
were
to
make
man
in
a
new
sense
the
centre
of
the
world
he
originated
or
at
least
was
the
first
to
proclaim
the
new
creed
of
man
destinies
indefinite
social
progress
chapter
vii
new
conceptions
of
history
montesquieu
voltaire
turgot
the
theory
of
human
progress
could
not
be
durably
established
by
abstract
arguments
or
on
the
slender
foundations
laid
by
the
abbe
de
it
must
ultimately
be
judged
by
the
evidence
afforded
by
history
and
it
is
not
accidental
that
contemporaneously
with
the
advent
of
this
idea
the
study
of
history
underwent
a
revolution
if
progress
was
to
be
more
than
the
sanguine
dream
of
an
optimist
it
must
be
shown
that
man
career
on
earth
had
not
been
a
chapter
of
accidents
which
might
lead
anywhere
or
nowhere
but
is
subject
to
discoverable
laws
which
have
determined
its
general
route
and
will
secure
his
arrival
at
the
desirable
place
hitherto
a
certain
order
and
unity
had
been
found
in
history
by
the
christian
theory
of
providential
design
and
final
causes
new
principles
of
order
and
unity
were
needed
to
replace
the
principles
which
rationalism
had
discredited
just
as
the
advance
of
science
depended
on
the
postulate
that
physical
phenomena
are
subject
to
invariable
laws
so
if
any
conclusions
were
to
be
drawn
from
history
some
similar
postulate
as
to
social
phenomena
was
required
it
was
thus
in
harmony
with
the
general
movement
of
thought
that
about
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
new
lines
of
investigation
were
opened
leading
to
sociology
the
history
of
civilisation
and
the
philosophy
of
history
montesquieu

may
claim
to

vision
of
the
past
montesquieu
was
not
among
the
apostles
of
the
idea
of
progress
it
never
secured
any
hold
upon
his
mind
but
he
had
grown
up
in
the
same
intellectual
climate
in
which
that
idea
was
produced
he
had
been
nurtured
both
on
the
dissolving
dialectic
of
bayle
and
on
the
cartesian
enunciation
of
natural
law
and
his
work
contributed
to
the
service
not
of
the
doctrine
of
the
past
but
of
the
doctrine
of
the
future
for
he
attempted
to
extend
the
cartesian
theory
to
social
facts
he
laid
down
that
political
like
physical
phenomena
are
subject
to
general
laws
he
had
already
conceived
this
his
most
striking
and
important
idea
when
he
wrote
the
considerations
on
the
greatness
and
decadence
of
the
romans
in
which
he
attempted
to
apply
it
it
is
not
fortune
who
governs
the
world
as
we
see
from
the
history
of
the
romans
there
are
general
causes
moral
or
physical
which
operate
in
every
monarchy
raise
it
maintain
it
or
overthrow
it
all
that
occurs
is
subject
to
these
causes
and
if
a
particular
cause
like
the
accidental
result
of
a
battle
has
ruined
a
state
there
was
a
general
cause
which
made
the
downfall
of
this
state
ensue
from
a
single
battle
in
a
word
the
principal
movement
principale
draws
with
it
all
the
particular
occurrences
but
if
this
excludes
fortune
it
also
dispenses
with
providence
design
and
final
causes
and
one
of
the
effects
of
the
considerations
which
montesquieu
can
not
have
overlooked
was
to
discredit
bossuet
treatment
of
history
the
esprit
des
lois
appeared
fourteen
years
later
among
books
which
have
exercised
a
considerable
influence
on
thought
few
are
more
disappointing
to
a
modern
reader
the
author
had
not
the
gift
of
what
might
be
called
logical
architecture
and
his
work
produces
the
effect
of
a
collection
of
ideas
which
he
was
unable
to
in
the
clarity
of
a
system
a
new
principle
the
operation
of
general
causes
is
enthroned
but
beyond
the
obvious
distinction
of
physical
and
moral
they
are
not
classified
we
have
no
guarantee
that
the
moral
causes
are
fully
enumerated
and
those
which
are
original
are
not
distinguished
from
those
which
are
derived
the
general
cause
which
montesquieu
impresses
most
clearly
on
the
reader
mind
is
that
of
physical
environment
geography
and
climate
the
influence
of
climate
on
civilisation
was
not
a
new
idea
in
modern
times
as
we
have
seen
it
was
noticed
by
bodin
and
recognised
by
fontenelle
the
abbe
de
applied
it
to
explain
the
origin
of
the
mohammedan
religion
and
the
abbe
du
bos
in
his
reflexions
on
poetry
and
painting
maintained
that
climate
helps
to
determine
the
epochs
of
art
and
science
chardin
in
his
travels
a
book
which
montesquieu
studied
had
also
appreciated
its
importance
but
montesquieu
drew
general
attention
to
it
and
since
he
wrote
geographical
conditions
have
been
recognised
by
all
inquirers
as
an
influential
factor
in
the
development
of
human
societies
his
own
discussion
of
the
question
did
not
result
in
any
useful
conclusions
he
did
not
determine
the
limits
of
the
action
of
physical
conditions
and
a
reader
hardly
knows
whether
to
regard
them
as
fundamental
or
accessory
as
determining
the
course
of
civilisation
or
only
perturbing
it
several
things
govern
men
he
says
climate
religion
laws
precepts
of
government
historical
examples
morals
and
manners
whence
is
formed
as
their
result
a
general
mind
esprit
general
this
of
climate
with
products
of
social
life
is
characteristic
of
his
unsystematic
thought
but
the
remark
which
the
author
went
on
to
make
that
there
is
always
a
correlation
between
the
laws
of
a
people
and
its
esprit
general
was
important
it
pointed
to
the
theory
that
all
the
products
of
social
life
are
closely
interrelated
in
montesquieu
time
people
were
under
the
illusion
that
legislation
has
an
almost
unlimited
power
to
modify
social
conditions
we
have
seen
this
in
the
case
of
montesquieu
conception
of
general
laws
should
have
been
an
antidote
to
this
belief
it
had
however
less
effect
on
his
contemporaries
than
we
might
have
expected
and
they
found
more
to
their
purpose
in
what
he
said
of
the
influence
of
laws
on
manners
there
may
be
something
in
comte
suggestion
that
he
could
not
give
his
conception
any
real
consistency
or
vigour
just
because
he
was
himself
unconsciously
under
the
influence
of
excessive
faith
in
the
effects
of
legislative
action
a
fundamental
defect
in
montesquieu
treatment
of
social
phenomena
is
that
he
abstracted
them
from
their
relations
in
time
it
was
his
merit
to
attempt
to
explain
the
correlation
of
laws
and
institutions
with
historical
circumstances
but
he
did
not
distinguish
or
connect
stages
of
civilisation
he
was
inclined
to
confound
as
sorel
has
observed
all
periods
and
constitutions
whatever
be
the
value
of
the
idea
of
progress
we
may
agree
with
comte
that
if
montesquieu
had
grasped
it
he
would
have
produced
a
more
striking
work
his
book
announces
a
revolution
in
the
study
of
political
science
but
in
many
ways
belongs
itself
to
the
era
in
the
same
years
in
which
montesquieu
was
busy
on
the
composition
of
the
esprit
des
lois
voltaire
was
writing
his
age
of
louis
xiv
and
his
essay
on
the
manners
and
mind
of
nations
and
on
the
principal
facts
of
history
from
charlemagne
to
the
death
of
louis
xiii
the
former
work
which
everybody
reads
still
appeared
in
parts
of
the
essay
which
has
long
since
fallen
into
neglect
were
published
in
the
mercure
de
france
between
and
it
was
issued
complete
in
along
with
the
age
of
louis
which
was
its
continuation
if
we
add
the
precis
of
the
reign
of
louis
xv
and
observe
that
the
introduction
and
first
fourteen
chapters
of
the
essay
sketch
the
history
of
the
world
before
charlemagne
and
that
china
india
and
america
are
included
in
the
survey
voltaire
work
amounts
to
a
complete
survey
of
the
civilisation
of
the
world
from
the
earliest
times
to
his
own
if
montesquieu
founded
social
science
voltaire
created
the
history
of
civilisation
and
the
essay
for
all
its
limitations
stands
out
as
one
of
the
considerable
books
of
the
century
in
his
age
of
louis
xiv
he
announced
that
his
object
was
to
paint
not
the
actions
of
a
single
man
but
the
mind
of
men
des
hommes
in
the
most
enlightened
age
that
had
ever
been
and
that
the
progress
of
the
arts
and
sciences
was
an
essential
part
of
his
subject
in
the
same
way
he
proposed
in
the
essay
to
trace
de
humain
not
the
details
of
facts
and
to
show
by
what
steps
man
advanced
from
the
barbarous
rusticity
of
the
times
of
charlemagne
and
his
successors
to
the
politeness
of
our
own
to
do
this
he
said
was
really
to
write
the
history
of
opinion
for
all
the
great
successive
social
and
political
changes
which
have
transformed
the
world
were
due
to
changes
of
opinion
prejudice
succeeded
prejudice
error
followed
error
at
last
with
time
men
came
to
correct
their
ideas
and
learn
to
think
the
motif
of
the
book
is
briefly
that
wars
and
religions
have
been
the
great
obstacles
to
the
progress
of
humanity
and
that
if
they
were
abolished
with
the
prejudices
which
engender
them
the
world
would
rapidly
improve
we
may
believe
he
says
that
reason
and
industry
will
always
progress
more
and
more
that
the
useful
arts
will
be
improved
that
of
the
evils
which
have
afflicted
men
prejudices
which
are
not
their
least
scourge
will
gradually
disappear
among
all
those
who
govern
nations
and
that
philosophy
universally
diffused
will
give
some
consolation
to
human
nature
for
the
calamities
which
it
will
experience
in
all
ages
this
indeed
is
not
the
tone
of
the
abbe
de
optimism
was
always
tempered
with
cynicism
but
the
idea
of
progress
is
there
though
moderately
conceived
and
it
is
based
on
the
same
principle
universal
reason
implanted
in
man
which
subsists
in
spite
of
all
the
passions
which
make
war
on
it
in
spite
of
all
the
tyrants
who
would
drown
it
in
blood
in
spite
of
the
imposters
who
would
annihilate
it
by
superstition
and
this
was
certainly
his
considered
view
his
common
sense
prevented
him
from
indulging
in
utopian
speculations
about
the
future
and
his
cynicism
constantly
led
him
to
use
the
language
of
a
pessimist
but
at
an
early
stage
of
his
career
he
had
taken
up
arms
for
human
nature
against
that
sublime
misanthrope
pascal
who
writes
against
human
nature
almost
as
he
wrote
against
the
jesuits
and
he
returned
to
the
attack
at
the
end
of
his
life
now
pascal
pensees
enshrined
a
theory
of
life
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
the
idea
that
the
object
of
life
is
to
prepare
for
death
which
was
sternly
opposed
to
the
spirit
of
progress
voltaire
instinctively
felt
that
this
was
an
enemy
that
had
to
be
dealt
with
in
a
lighter
vein
he
had
maintained
in
a
poem
le
mondain
footnote
the
value
of
civilisation
and
all
its
effects
including
luxury
against
those
who
regretted
the
simplicity
of
ancient
times
the
golden
age
of
saturn
o
le

pure
ignorance
to
return
to
the
essay
it
flung
down
the
gage
of
battle
to
that
conception
of
the
history
of
the
world
which
had
been
brilliantly
represented
by
bossuet
discours
sur
universelle
this
work
was
constantly
in
voltaire
mind
he
pointed
out
that
it
had
no
claim
to
be
universal
it
related
only
to
four
or
five
peoples
and
especially
the
little
jewish
nation
which
was
unknown
to
the
rest
of
the
world
or
justly
despised
but
which
bossuet
made
the
centre
of
interest
as
if
the
final
cause
of
all
the
great
empires
of
antiquity
lay
in
their
relations
to
the
jews
he
had
bossuet
in
mind
when
he
said
we
will
speak
of
the
jews
as
we
would
speak
of
scythians
or
greeks
weighing
probabilities
and
discussing
facts
in
his
new
perspective
the
significance
of
hebrew
history
is
for
the
first
time
reduced
to
moderate
limits
but
it
was
not
only
in
this
particular
though
central
point
that
voltaire
challenged
bossuet
view
he
eliminated
final
causes
altogether
and
providence
plays
no
part
on
his
historical
stage
here
his
work
reinforced
the
teaching
of
montesquieu
otherwise
montesquieu
and
voltaire
entirely
differed
in
their
methods
voltaire
concerned
himself
only
with
the
causal
enchainment
of
events
and
the
immediate
motives
of
men
his
interpretation
of
history
was
confined
to
the
discovery
of
particular
causes
he
did
not
consider
the
operation
of
those
larger
general
causes
which
montesquieu
investigated
montesquieu
sought
to
show
that
the
vicissitudes
of
societies
were
subject
to
law
voltaire
believed
that
events
were
determined
by
chance
where
they
were
not
consciously
guided
by
human
reason
the
element
of
chance
is
conspicuous
even
in
legislation
almost
all
laws
have
been
instituted
to
meet
passing
needs
like
remedies
applied
fortuitously
which
have
cured
one
patient
and
kill
others
on
voltaire
theory
the
development
of
humanity
might
at
any
moment
have
been
diverted
into
a
different
course
but
whatever
course
it
took
the
nature
of
human
reason
would
have
ensured
a
progress
in
civilisation
yet
the
reader
of
the
essay
and
louis
xiv
might
well
have
come
away
with
a
feeling
that
the
security
of
progress
is
frail
and
precarious
if
fortune
has
governed
events
if
the
rise
and
fall
of
empires
the
succession
of
religions
the
revolutions
of
states
and
most
of
the
great
crises
of
history
were
decided
by
accidents
is
there
any
cogent
ground
for
believing
that
human
reason
the
principle
to
which
voltaire
attributes
the
advance
of
civilisation
will
prevail
in
the
long
run
civilisation
has
been
organised
here
and
there
now
and
then
up
to
a
certain
point
there
have
been
eras
of
rapid
progress
but
how
can
we
be
sure
that
these
are
not
episodes
themselves
also
fortuitous
for
growth
has
been
followed
by
decay
progress
by
regress
can
it
be
said
that
history
authorises
the
conclusion
that
reason
will
ever
gain
such
an
ascendancy
that
the
play
of
chance
will
no
longer
be
able
to
thwart
her
will
is
such
a
conclusion
more
than
a
hope
unsanctioned
by
the
data
of
past
experience
merely
one
of
the
characteristics
of
the
age
of
illumination
voltaire
and
montesquieu
thus
raised
fundamental
questions
of
great
moment
for
the
doctrine
of
progress
questions
which
belong
to
what
was
soon
to
be
known
as
the
philosophy
of
history
a
name
invented
by
voltaire
though
hardly
meant
by
him
in
the
sense
which
it
afterwards
assumed
six
years
before
voltaire
essay
was
published
in
its
complete
form
a
young
man
was
planning
a
work
on
the
same
subject
turgot
is
honourably
remembered
as
an
economist
and
administrator
but
if
he
had
ever
written
the
discourses
on
universal
history
which
he
designed
at
the
age
of
his
position
in
historical
literature
might
have
overshadowed
his
other
claims
to
be
remembered
we
possess
a
partial
sketch
of
its
plan
which
is
supplemented
by
two
lectures
he
delivered
at
the
sorbonne
in
so
that
we
know
his
general
conceptions
he
had
assimilated
the
ideas
of
the
esprit
des
lois
and
it
is
probable
that
he
had
read
the
parts
of
voltaire
work
which
had
appeared
in
a
periodical
his
work
like
voltaire
was
to
be
a
challenge
to
bossuet
view
of
history
his
purpose
was
to
trace
the
fortunes
of
the
race
in
the
light
of
the
idea
of
progress
he
occasionally
refers
to
providence
but
this
is
no
more
than
a
prudent
providence
has
no
functions
in
his
scheme
the
part
which
it
played
in
bossuet
is
usurped
by
those
general
causes
which
he
had
learned
from
montesquieu
but
his
systematic
mind
would
have
organised
and
classified
the
ideas
which
montesquieu
left
somewhat
confused
he
criticised
the
inductions
drawn
in
the
esprit
des
lois
concerning
the
influence
of
climate
as
hasty
and
exaggerated
and
he
pointed
out
that
the
physical
causes
can
only
produce
their
effects
by
acting
on
the
hidden
principles
which
contribute
to
form
our
mind
and
character
it
follows
that
the
psychical
or
moral
causes
are
the
first
element
to
consider
and
it
is
a
fault
of
method
to
try
to
evaluate
physical
causes
till
we
have
exhausted
the
moral
and
are
certain
that
the
phenomena
can
not
be
explained
by
these
alone
in
other
words
the
study
of
the
development
of
societies
must
be
based
on
psychology
and
for
turgot
as
for
all
his
progressive
contemporaries
psychology
meant
the
philosophy
of
locke
general
necessary
causes
therefore
which
we
should
rather
call
conditions
have
determined
the
course
of
history
the
nature
of
man
his
passions
and
his
reason
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
second
his
environment
geography
and
climate
but
its
course
is
a
strict
sequence
of
particular
causes
and
effects
which
bind
the
state
of
the
world
at
a
given
moment
to
all
those
which
have
preceded
it
turgot
does
not
discuss
the
question
of
but
his
causal
continuity
does
not
exclude
the
free
action
of
great
men
he
conceives
universal
history
as
the
progress
of
the
human
race
advancing
as
an
immense
whole
steadily
though
slowly
through
alternating
periods
of
calm
and
disturbance
towards
greater
perfection
the
various
units
of
the
entire
mass
do
not
move
with
equal
steps
because
nature
is
not
impartial
with
her
gifts
some
men
have
talents
denied
to
others
and
the
gifts
of
nature
are
sometimes
developed
by
circumstances
sometimes
left
buried
in
obscurity
the
inequalities
in
the
march
of
nations
are
due
to
the
infinite
variety
of
circumstances
and
these
inequalities
may
be
taken
to
prove
that
the
world
had
a
beginning
for
in
an
eternal
duration
they
would
have
disappeared
but
the
development
of
human
societies
has
not
been
guided
by
human
reason
men
have
not
consciously
made
general
happiness
the
end
of
their
actions
they
have
been
conducted
by
passion
and
ambition
and
have
never
known
to
what
goal
they
were
moving
for
if
reason
had
presided
progress
would
soon
have
been
arrested
to
avoid
war
peoples
would
have
remained
in
isolation
and
the
race
would
have
lived
divided
for
ever
into
a
multitude
of
isolated
groups
speaking
different
tongues
all
these
groups
would
have
been
limited
in
the
range
of
their
ideas
stationary
in
science
art
and
government
and
would
never
have
risen
above
mediocrity
the
history
of
china
is
an
example
of
the
results
of
restricted
intercourse
among
peoples
thus
the
unexpected
conclusion
emerges
that
without
unreason
and
injustice
there
would
have
been
no
progress
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
observe
that
this
argument
is
untenable
the
hypothesis
assumes
that
reason
is
in
control
among
the
primitive
peoples
and
at
the
same
time
supposes
that
its
power
would
completely
disappear
if
they
attempted
to
engage
in
peaceful
intercourse
but
though
turgot
has
put
his
point
in
an
unconvincing
form
his
purpose
was
to
show
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
tumultuous
and
dangerous
passions
have
been
which
have
moved
the
world
in
a
desirable
direction
till
the
time
should
come
for
reason
to
take
the
helm
thus
while
turgot
might
have
subscribed
to
voltaire
assertion
that
history
is
largely
un
ramas
de
crimes
de
folies
et
de
malheurs
his
view
of
the
significance
of
man
sufferings
is
different
and
almost
approaches
the
facile
optimism
of
pope
whatever
is
is
right
he
regards
all
the
race
actual
experiences
as
the
indispensable
mechanism
of
progress
and
does
not
regret
its
mistakes
and
calamities
many
changes
and
revolutions
he
observes
may
seem
to
have
had
most
mischievous
effects
yet
every
change
has
brought
some
advantage
for
it
has
been
a
new
experience
and
therefore
has
been
instructive
man
advances
by
committing
errors
the
history
of
science
shows
as
fontenelle
had
pointed
out
that
truth
is
reached
over
the
ruins
of
false
hypotheses
the
difficulty
presented
by
periods
of
decadence
and
barbarism
succeeding
epochs
of
enlightenment
is
met
by
the
assertion
that
in
such
dark
times
the
world
has
not
stood
still
there
has
really
been
a
progression
which
though
relatively
inconspicuous
is
not
unimportant
in
the
middle
ages
which
are
the
prominent
case
there
were
improvements
in
mechanical
arts
in
commerce
in
some
of
the
habits
of
civil
life
all
of
which
helped
to
prepare
the
way
for
happier
times
here
turgot
view
of
history
is
sharply
opposed
to
voltaire
he
considers
christianity
to
have
been
a
powerful
agent
of
civilisation
not
a
hinderer
or
an
enemy
had
he
executed
his
design
his
work
might
well
have
furnished
a
notable
makeweight
to
the
view
held
by
voltaire
and
afterwards
more
judicially
developed
by
gibbon
that
the
triumph
of
barbarism
and
religion
was
a
calamity
for
the
world
turgot
also
propounded
two
laws
of
development
he
observed
that
when
a
people
is
progressing
every
step
it
takes
causes
an
acceleration
in
the
rate
of
progress
and
he
anticipated
comte
famous
law
of
the
three
stages
of
intellectual
evolution
though
without
giving
it
the
extensive
and
fundamental
significance
which
comte
claimed
for
it
before
man
understood
the
causal
connection
of
physical
phenomena
nothing
was
so
natural
as
to
suppose
they
were
produced
by
intelligent
beings
invisible
and
resembling
ourselves
for
what
else
would
they
have
resembled
that
is
comte
theological
stage
when
philosophers
recognised
the
absurdity
of
the
fables
about
the
gods
but
had
not
yet
gained
an
insight
into
natural
history
they
thought
to
explain
the
causes
of
phenomena
by
abstract
expressions
such
as
essences
and
faculties
that
is
the
metaphysical
stage
it
was
only
at
a
later
period
that
by
observing
the
reciprocal
mechanical
action
of
bodies
hypotheses
were
formed
which
could
be
developed
by
mathematics
and
verified
by
experience
there
is
the
positive
stage
the
observation
assuredly
does
not
possess
the
importance
which
comte
attached
to
it
but
whatever
value
it
has
turgot
deserves
the
credit
of
having
been
the
first
to
state
it
the
notes
which
turgot
made
for
his
plan
permit
us
to
conjecture
that
his
universal
history
would
have
been
a
greater
and
more
profound
work
than
the
essay
of
voltaire
it
would
have
embodied
in
a
digested
form
the
ideas
of
montesquieu
to
which
voltaire
paid
little
attention
and
the
author
would
have
elaborated
the
intimate
connection
and
mutual
interaction
among
all
social
phenomena
government
and
morals
religion
science
and
arts
while
his
general
thesis
coincided
with
that
of
voltaire
the
gradual
advance
of
humanity
towards
a
state
of
enlightenment
and
reasonableness
he
made
the
idea
of
progress
more
vital
for
him
it
was
an
organising
conception
just
as
the
idea
of
providence
was
for
augustine
and
bossuet
an
organising
conception
which
gave
history
its
unity
and
meaning
the
view
that
man
has
throughout
been
blindly
moving
in
the
right
direction
is
the
counterpart
of
what
bossuet
represented
as
a
divine
plan
wrought
out
by
the
actions
of
men
who
are
ignorant
of
it
and
is
sharply
opposed
to
the
views
of
voltaire
and
the
other
philosophers
of
the
day
who
ascribed
progress
exclusively
to
human
reason
consciously
striving
against
ignorance
and
passion

economists
the
intellectual
movement
which
prepared
french
opinion
for

and
supplied
the
principles
for
reconstituting
society
may
be
described
as
humanistic
in
the
sense
that
man
was
the
centre
of
speculative
interest
one
consideration
especially
that
we
ought
never
to
lose
from
sight
says
diderot
is
that
if
we
ever
banish
a
man
or
the
thinking
and
contemplative
being
from
above
the
surface
of
the
earth
this
pathetic
and
sublime
spectacle
of
nature
becomes
no
more
than
a
scene
of
melancholy
and
silence
it
is
the
presence
of
man
that
gives
its
interest
to
the
existence
of
other
beings
why
should
we
not
make
him
a
common
centre
man
is
the
single
term
from
which
we
ought
to
set
out

hence
psychology
morals
the
structure
of
society
were
the
subjects
which
riveted
attention
instead
of
the
larger
problems
which
had
occupied
descartes
malebranche
and
leibnitz
it
mattered
little
whether
the
universe
was
the
best
that
could
be
constructed
what
mattered
was
the
relation
of
man
own
little
world
to
his
will
and
capacities
physical
science
was
important
only
in
so
far
as
it
could
help
social
science
and
minister
to
the
needs
of
man
the
closest
analogy
to
this
development
of
thought
is
not
offered
by
the
renaissance
to
which
the
description
humanistic
has
been
conventionally
appropriated
but
rather
by
the
age
of
illumination
in
greece
in
the
latter
half
of
the
fifth
century
represented
by
protagoras
socrates
and
others
who
turned
from
the
ultimate
problems
of
the
cosmos
hitherto
the
main
study
of
philosophers
to
man
his
nature
and
his
works
in
this
revised
form
of
we
see
how
the
general
movement
of
thought
has
instinctively
adapted
itself
to
the
astronomical
revolution
on
the
ptolemaic
system
it
was
not
incongruous
or
absurd
that
man
lord
of
the
central
domain
in
the
universe
should
regard
himself
as
the
most
important
cosmic
creature
this
is
the
view
implicit
in
the
christian
scheme
which
had
been
constructed
on
the
old
erroneous
cosmology
when
the
true
place
of
the
earth
was
shown
and
man
found
himself
in
a
tiny
planet
attached
to
one
of
innumerable
solar
worlds
his
cosmic
importance
could
no
longer
be
maintained
he
was
reduced
to
the
condition
of
an
insect
creeping
on
a

vividly

interprets
his

as

decides
that
he
is
at

master
of
his

he
can
fling
away
the
old
equipment
of
final
causes
original

and
the
rest
he
can
construct
his
own
chart
and
bound
by
no

scheme
he
need
take
the
universe
into
account
only
in
so
far
as
he
judges
it
to
be
to
his
own
profit
or
if
he
is
a
philosopher
he
may
say
that
after
all
the
universe
for
him
is
built
out
of
his
own
sensations
and
that
by
virtue
of
this
relativity
is
restored

although

by

they
left
it
rather
vague
and
the

seldom
pronounced
in

it
is
convenient
for
the

to
group
together
the
thinkers
including
voltaire
associated
with
the
encyclopaedia
who
represented
a
critical
and
consciously
aggressive
force
against
traditional
theories
and
existing
institutions
the
constructive
thinker
rousseau
was
not
less
aggressive
but
he
stands
apart
and
opposed
by
his
hostility
to
modern
civilisation
thirdly
we
must
distinguish
the
school
of
economists
also
reformers
and
optimists
but
of
more
conservative
temper
than
the
typical
encyclopaedists
the
encyclopaedia
has
rightly
been
pronounced
the

various

most

what

from

for

as
an
organ
for
the
penetrating
criticism
of
traditional

if
diderot
who
directed
the
encyclopaedia
with
the
assistance
of
the
mathematician
had
lived
a
hundred
years
later
he
would
probably
have
edited
a
journal
we
saw
that
the
solidarity
of
the
sciences
was
one
of
the
conceptions
associated
with
the
theory
of
intellectual
progress
and
that
the
popularisation
of
knowledge
was
another
both
these
conceptions
inspired
the
encyclopaedia
which
was
to
gather
up
and
concentrate
the
illumination
of
the
modern
age
it
was
to
establish
the
lines
of
communication
among
all
departments
to
enclose
in
the
unity
of
a
system
the
infinitely
various
branches
of
knowledge
and
it
was
to
be
a
library
of
popular
instruction
but
it
was
also
intended
to
be
an
organ
of
propaganda
in
the
history
of
the
intellectual
revolution
it
is
in
some
ways
the
successor
of
the
dictionary
of
bayle
which
two
generations
before
collected
the
material
of
war
to
demolish
traditional
doctrines
the
encyclopaedia
carried
on
the
campaign
against
authority
and
superstition
by
indirect
methods
but
it
was
the
work
of
men
who
were
not
sceptics
like
bayle
but
had
ideals
positive
purposes
and
social
hopes
they
were
not
only
confident
in
reason
and
in
science
but
most
of
them
had
also
a
more
or
less
definite
belief
in
the
possibility
of
an
advance
of
humanity
towards
perfection
as
one
of
their
own
band
afterwards
remarked
they
were
less
occupied
in
enlarging
the
bounds
of
knowledge
than
in
spreading
the
light
and
making
war
on
prejudice

the
views
of
the
individual
contributors
differed
greatly
and
they
can
not
be
called
a
school
but
they
agreed
so
far
in
common
tendencies
that
they
were
able
to
form
a
alliance
the
propaganda
of
which
the
encyclopaedia
was
the
centre
was
reinforced
by
the
independent
publications
of
some
of
the
leading
men
who
collaborated
or
were
closely
connected
with
their
circle
notably
those
of
diderot
himself
baron
and
helvetius
the
optimism
of
the
encyclopaedists
was
really
based
on
an
intense
consciousness
of
the
enlightenment
of
their
own
age
the
progressiveness
of
knowledge
was
taken
as
axiomatic
but
was
there
any
guarantee
that
the
light
now
confined
to
small
circles
could
ever
enlighten
the
world
and
regenerate
mankind
they
found
the
guarantee
they
required
not
in
an
induction
from
the
past
experience
of
the
race
but
in
an
a
priori
theory
the
indefinite
malleability
of
human
nature
by
education
and
institutions
this
had
been
as
we
saw
assumed
by
the
abbe
de
it
pervaded
the
speculation
of
the
age
and
was
formally
deduced
from
the
sensational
psychology
of
locke
and
condillac
it
was
developed
in
an
extreme
form
in
the
work
of
helvetius
de
in
this
book
which
was
to
exert
a
large
influence
in
england
helvetius
sought
among
other
things
to
show
that
the
science
of
morals
is
equivalent
to
the
science
of
legislation
and
that
in
a
society
all
men
are
capable
of
rising
to
the
highest
point
of
mental
development
intellectual
and
moral
inequalities
between
man
and
man
arise
entirely
from
differences
in
education
and
social
circumstances
genius
itself
is
not
a
gift
of
nature
the
man
of
genius
is
a
product
of
circumstances
social
not
physical
for
helvetius
rejects
the
influence
of
climate
it
follows
that
if
you
change
education
and
social
institutions
you
can
change
the
character
of
men
the
error
of
helvetius
in
ignoring
the
irremovable
physical
differences
between
individuals
the
varieties
of
cerebral
organisation
was
at
once
pointed
out
by
diderot
this
error
however
was
not
essential
to
the
general
theory
of
the
immeasurable
power
of
social
institutions
over
human
character
and
other
thinkers
did
not
fall
into
it
all
alike
indeed
were
blind
to
the
factor
of
heredity
but
the
theory
in
its
collective
application
contains
a
truth
which
nineteenth
century
critics
biassed
by
their
studies
in
heredity
have
been
prone
to
overlook
the
social
inheritance
of
ideas
and
emotions
to
which
the
individual
is
submitted
from
infancy
is
more
important
than
the
tendencies
physically
transmitted
from
parent
to
child
the
power
of
education
and
government
in
moulding
the
members
of
a
society
has
recently
been
illustrated
on
a
large
scale
in
the
psychological
transformation
of
the
german
people
in
the
life
of
a
generation

followed
from
the

expounded

are

to
the
opinion
that
enormous
differences
in

are
a
result
of
the
differences
in

and
that
these
again
are
due

a

sequence
of
historical
circumstances
and
consequently
that
there
is
no
people
in
the

doomed
by

to
perpetual
inferiority
or
irrevocably
disqualified
by

from
playing
a

possibility
of

it
marked
therefore
an
important
stage
in
the
development
of
the
doctrine
of
progress
it
gave
moreover
a
new
and
larger
content
to
that
doctrine
by
its
applicability
not
only
to
the
peoples
which
are
at
present
in
the
van
of
civilisation
but
also
to
those
which
have
lagged
far
behind
and
may
appear
irreclaimably
barbarous

potentially
including

turgot
had
already
conceived
the
total

the
human
race

he
had
declared
that
the
human

everywhere
contains
the
germs
of
progress
and
that
the
inequality
of
peoples
is
due
to
the
infinite
variety
of

this
enlarging
conception
was
calculated
to
add
strength

it

laid

from
it
they
deduced
their
economic

they
assumed

in

own

to
discover
the
natural
order
for
the

assure
to
them
temporal

an
order
in

everything

in
which
the
interests
of
all
are
so
perfectly
and
intimately
consolidated
that
all
are
happy
from
the
ruler
to
the
least
of
his
subjects
but
in
what
does
this
happiness
consist
his
answer
is
that
humanly
speaking
the
greatest
happiness
possible
for
us
consists
in
the
greatest
possible
abundance
of
objects
suitable
to
our
enjoyment
and
in
the
greatest
liberty
to
profit
by
them
and
liberty
is
necessary
not
only
to
enjoy
them
but
also
to
produce
them
in
the
greatest
abundance
since
liberty
stimulates
human
efforts
another
condition
of
abundance
is
the
multiplication
of
the
race

the
happiness
of
men
and
their
numbers
are
closely
bound
up
together
in
the
system
of
nature
from
these
axioms
may
be
deduced
the
natural
order
of
a
human
society
the
reciprocal
duties
and
rights
whose
enforcement
is
required
for
the
greatest
possible
multiplication
of
products
in
order
to
procure
to
the
race
the
greatest
sum
of
happiness
with
the
maximum
population
now
individual
property
is
the
indispensable
condition
for
full
enjoyment
of
the
products
of
human
labour
property
is
the
measure
of
liberty
and
liberty
is
the
measure
of
property
hence
to
realise
general
happiness
it
is
only
necessary
to
maintain
property
and
consequently
liberty
in
all
their
natural
extent
the
fatal
error
which
has
made
history
what
it
is
has
been
the
failure
to
recognise
this
simple
fact
for
aggression
and
conquest
the
causes
of
human
miseries
violate
the
law
of
property
which
is
the
foundation
of
happiness
the
practical
inference
was
that
the
chief
function
of
government
was
to
protect
property
and
that
complete
freedom
should
be
left
to
private
enterprise

exploit
the

all
would
be
well
if

apart

they
differed
from

two
very
important
points
they
did
not
believe
that

was

and
therefore
they
did
not

that
there

held

was
one
of
its
immutable
features
immutable
because
it
is
a
consequence
of
the
inequality
of

powers
but
they
believed
in
the
future
progress
of

towards
a
state
of
happiness
through
the
increase
of
opulence
which
would
itself
depend
on

threw
all

had

economic
liberty
neither
they
nor
the
philosophers
nor
rousseau
the
father
of
modern
democracy
had
any
just
conception
of
what
political
liberty
means
they
contributed
much
to
its
realisation
but
their
own
ideas
of
it
were
narrow
and
imperfect
they
never
challenged
the
principle
of
a
despotic
government
they
only
contended
that
the
despotism
must
be
enlightened
the
paternal
rule
of
a

acting
under

to
them
the

discourses

optimist

begins
by
appreciating
the
specious
splendour
of
modern
enlightenment
the
voyages
of

intellect
among
the
stars
and
then
goes
on
to
assever
that
in
the
first
place
men
have
lost
through
their
civilisation
the
original
liberty
for
which
they
were
born
and
that
arts
and
science
flinging
garlands
of
flowers
on
the
iron
chains
which
bind
them
make
them
love
their
slavery
and
secondly
that
there
is
a
real
depravity
beneath
the
fair
semblance
and
our
souls
are
corrupted
as
our
sciences
and
arts
advance
to
perfection
nor
is
this
only
a
modern
phenomenon
the
evils
due
to
our
vain
curiosity
are
as
old
as
the

it
is
a
law
of
history
that
morals
fall

decline
of
the

this

is
feeble

has
little
ingenuity
it
is
a
declamation
rather
than
an
argument

in
the
end
he
makes
concessions
which
undo
the
effect

more
telling
than
rousseau
generalities
footnote
in
his
admirable
edition
of
the
political
writings
of
rousseau
vaughan
suggests
that
in
later
works
we
may
possibly
detect
the
first
faint
beginnings
of
a
belief
in
progress
and
attributes
this
to
the
influence
of
montesquieu
if
civilisation
has
been
the
curse
of
man
it
might
seem
that
the
logical
course
for
rousseau
to
recommend
was
its
destruction
this
was
the
inference
which
voltaire
drew
in
timon
to
laugh
the
whole
theory
out
of
court
but
rousseau
did
not
suggest
a
movement
to
destroy
all
the
libraries
and
all
the
works
of
art
in
the
world
to
put
to
death
or
silence
all
the
savants
to
pull
down
the
cities
and
burn
the
ships
he
was
not
a
mere
dreamer
and
his
arcadia
was
no
more
than
a
utopian
ideal
by
the
light
of
which
he
conceived
that
the
society
of
his
own
day
might
be
corrected
and
transformed
he
attached
his
hopes
to
equality
democracy
and
a
radical
change
in
education
equality
this
revolutionary
idea
was
of
course
quite
compatible
with
the
theory
of
progress
and
was
soon
to
be
closely
associated
with
it
but
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
the
two
ideas
should
first
have
appeared
in
antagonism
to
each
other
the
advance
of
knowledge
and
the
increase
of
man
power
over
nature
had
virtually
profited
only
a
minority
when
fontenelle
or
voltaire
vaunted
the
illumination
of
their
age
and
glorified
the
modern
revolution
in
scientific
thought
they
took
account
only
of
a
small
class
of
privileged
people
higher
education
voltaire
observed

not
for
cobblers
or
kitchenmaids
on
jamais

et
les

the
theory
of
progress
had
so
far
left
the
masses
out
of
account
rousseau
contrasted
the
splendour
of
the
french
court
the
luxury
of
the
opulent
the
enlightenment
of
those
who
had
the
opportunity
of
education
with
the
hard
lot
of
the
ignorant
mass
of
peasants
whose
toil
paid
for
the
luxury
of
many
of
the
idle
enlightened
people
who
amused
themselves
at
paris
the
horror
of
this
contrast
which
left
voltaire
cold
was
the
poignant
motive
which
inspired
rousseau
a
man
of
the
people
in
constructing
his
new
doctrine
the
existing
inequality
seemed
an
injustice
which
rendered
the
of
the
age
revolting
if
this
is
the
result
of
progressive
civilisation
what
is
progress
worth
the
next
step
is
to
declare
that
civilisation
is
the
causa
malorum
and
that
what
is
named
progress
is
really
regress
but
rousseau
found
a
way
of
circumventing
pessimism
he
asked
himself
can
not
equality
be
realised
in
an
organised
state
founded
on
natural
right
the
social
contract
was
his
answer
and
there
we
can
see
the
living
idea
of
equality
detaching
itself
from
the
dead
theory
of
degradation
footnote
the
consistency
of
the
social
contract
with
the
discourse
on
inequality
has
been
much
debated
they
deal
with
two
distinct
problems
and
the
social
contract
does
not
mark
any
change
in
the
author
views
though
it
was
not
published
till
he
had
been
working
at
it
since
arcadianism
which
was
thus
only
a
for
rousseau
was
the
extreme
expression
of
tendencies
which
appear
in
the
speculations
of
other
thinkers
of
the
day
morelly
and
mably
argued
in
favour
of
a
reversion
to
simpler
forms
of
life
they
contemplated
the
foundation
of
socialistic

reviving
institutions

which
belonged

a
role
which
has
not

they
ascribed

arising
from

morelly
rejected
the

was

the
fact

met
all
these

by
pointing
out
that
human

it
would

there
was
indeed
one
question
which
caused
some
embarrassment
to
believers
in
progress
the
increase
of
wealth
and
luxury
was
evidently
a
salient
feature
in
modern
progressive
states
and
it
was
clear
that
there
was
an
intimate
connection
between
the
growth
of
knowledge
and
the
growth
of
commerce
and
industrial
arts
and
that
the
natural
progress
of
these
meant
an
accumulation
of
riches
and
the
practice
of
more
refined
luxury
the
question
therefore
whether
luxury
is
injurious
to
the
general
happiness
occupied
the
attention
of
the
philosophers

the
arguments
which
could
be
urged
on
both
sides
perhaps
the
most
reasonable
contribution
to
the
subject
was
an
essay
of
hume
it
is
obvious
that
rousseau
and
all
other
theorists
of
regress
would
be
definitely
refuted
if
it
could
be
proved
by
an
historical
investigation
that
in
no
period
in
the
past
had
man

been
happier
than
in
the
present
such
an
inquiry
was
undertaken
by
the
chevalier
de
chastellux
his
book
on
public
felicity
or
considerations
on
the
lot
of
men
in
the
various
epochs
of
history
appeared
in
and
had
a
wide
circulation

was
a

a
survey
of
the
history

aims
at
proving
the
certainty
of
future
progress
it
betrays
the
influence
both
of
the
encyclopaedists
and
of
the
economists
chastellux
is
convinced
that
human
nature
can
be
indefinitely
moulded
by
institutions
that
enlightenment
is
a
necessary
condition
of
general
happiness
that
war
and
superstition
for
which
governments
and
priests
are
responsible
are
the
principal
obstacles
but
he
attempted
to
do
what
none
of
his
masters
had
done
to
test
the
question
methodically
from
the
data
of
history
turgot
and
voltaire
in
his
way
had
traced
the
growth
of
civilisation
the
originality
of
chastellux
lay
in
concentrating
attention
on
the
eudaemonic
issue
in
examining
each
historical
period
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
whether
people
on
the
whole
were
happy
and
enviable
has
there
ever
been
a
time
he
inquired
in
which
public
felicity
was
greater
than
in
our
own
in
which
it
would
have
been
desirable
to
remain
for
ever
and
to
which
it
would
now
be
desirable
to
return
he
begins
by
brushing
away
the
hypothesis
of
an
arcadia
we
know
really
nothing
about
primitive
man
there
is
not
sufficient
evidence
to
authorise
conjectures
we
know
man
only
as
he
has
existed
in
organised
societies
and
if
we
are
to
condemn
modern
civilisation
and
its
prospects
we
must
find
our
term
of
comparison
not
in
an
imaginary
golden
age
but
in
a
known
historical
epoch
and
we
must
be
careful
not
to
fall
into
the
mistakes
of
confusing
public
prosperity
with
general
happiness
and
of
considering
only
the
duration
or
aggrandisement
of
empires
and
ignoring
the
lot
of
the
common
people
his
survey
of
history
is
summary
and
superficial
enough
he
gives
reasons
for
believing
that
no
peoples
from
the
ancient
egyptians
and
assyrians
to
the
europeans
of
the
renaissance
can
be
judged
happy
yet
what
about
the
greeks
theirs
was
an
age
of
enlightenment
in
a
few
pages
he
examines
their
laws
and
history
and
concludes
we
are
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
what
is
called
the
bel
age
of
greece
was
a
time
of
pain
and
torture
for
humanity
and
in
ancient
history
generally
slavery
alone
sufficed
to
make
man
condition
a
hundred
times
worse
than
it
is
at
present
the
miseries
of
life
in
the
roman
period
are
even
more
apparent
than
in
the
greek
what
englishman
or
frenchman
would
tolerate
life
as
lived
in
ancient
rome
it
is
interesting
to
remember
that
four
years
later
an
englishman
who
had
an
incomparably
wider
and
deeper
knowledge
of
history
declared
it
to
be
probable
that
in
the
age
of
the
antonines
civilised
europe
enjoyed
greater
happiness
than
at
any
other
period
rome
declined
and
christianity
came
its
purpose
was
not
to
render
men
happy
on
earth
and
we
do
not
find
that
it
made
rulers
less
avaricious
or
less
sanguinary
peoples
more
patient
or
quiet
crimes
rarer
punishments
less
cruel
treaties
more
faithfully
observed
or
wars
waged
more
humanely
the
conclusion
is
that
it
is
only
those
who
are
profoundly
ignorant
of
the
past
who
can
regret
the
good
old
times
throughout
this
survey
chastellux
does
not
like
turgot
make
any
attempt
to
show
that
the
race
was
progressing
however
slowly
on
the
contrary
he
sets
the
beginning
of
continuous
progress
in
the
renaissance
here
agreeing
with
and
voltaire
the
intellectual
movement
which
originated
then
and
resulted
in
the
enlightenment
of
his
own
day
was
a
condition
of
social
progress
but
alone
it
would
not
have
been
enough
as
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
the
intellectual
brilliancy
of
the
great
age
of
greece
exerted
no
beneficent
effects
on
the
of
the
people
nor
indeed
was
there
any
perceptible
improvement
in
the
prospect
of
happiness
for
the
people
at
large
during
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
notwithstanding
the
progress
of
science
and
the
arts
but
the
terrible
wars
of
this
period
exhausted
europe
and
this
financial
exhaustion
has
supplied
the
requisite
conditions
for
attaining
a
measure
of
felicity
never
realised
in
the
past
peace
is
an
advantageous
condition
for
the
progress
of
reason
but
especially
when
it
is
the
result
of
the
exhaustion
of
peoples
and
their
satiety
of
fighting
frivolous
ideas
disappear
political
bodies
like
organisms
have
the
care
of
impressed
upon
them
by
pain
the
human
mind
hitherto
exercised
on
agreeable
objects
falls
back
with
more
energy
on
useful
objects
a
more
successful
appeal
can
be
made
to
the
rights
of
humanity
and
princes
who
have
become
creditors
and
debtors
of
their
subjects
permit
them
to
be
happy
in
order
that
they
may
be
more
solvent
or
more
patient
this
is
not
very
lucid
or
convincing
but
the
main
point
is
that
intellectual
enlightenment
would
be
ineffective
without
the
of
political
events
and
no
political
events
would
permanently
help
humanity
without
the
progress
of
knowledge
public
felicity
consists

and
domestic

ordinary

it

the

is
at

show
the

he
avails
himself

prove

men

of

will
be
duly
recognised

the
state
control
which
weighed
upon
them
so

not

abolished

is
no
preventive
censorship
to
hinder
publication
but
there
are
censors
there
are
no
fines
or

but
there
are
admonitions
and
if
any
one
publishes
a
book
defending
principles
which
are
considered
dangerous
he
is
obliged
to
go
about
in
a
black
mask

is
a
state
religion
deism
there
is
probably
no
one
who
does
not

if
any
atheist
were
discovered
he
would
be
put
through
a
course

experimental
physics
if
he
remained
obdurate
in
his
rejection
of
a
palpable
and
salutary
truth
the
nation
would
go
into
mourning
and
banish
him
from
its
borders
every
one
has
to
work

labour
no
longer
resembles
slavery
as
there
are
no
monks
nor
numerous
domestics
nor
useless
valets
nor
employed
on
the
production
of
childish
luxuries
a
few
daily
hours
of
labour
are
sufficient
for
the
public
wants
censors
inquire
into
capacities
assign
tasks
to
the
unemployed
and
if
man
be
found
fit
for
nothing
but
the
consumption
of
food
he
is
banished
from
the
city
these
are
some
of
the
leading
features
of
the
ideal
future
to
which
mercier
imagination
reached
he
did
not
put
it
forward
as
a
final
term
later
ages
he
said
will
go
further
for
where
can
the
perfectibility
of
man
stop
armed
with
geometry
and
the
mechanical
arts
and
chemistry
but
in
his
scanty
prophecies
of
what
science
might
effect
he
showed
curiously
little
resource
the
truth
is
that
this
had
not
much
interest
for
him
and
he
did
not
see
that
scientific
discoveries
might
transmute
social
conditions
the
world
of
its
intolerably
docile
and
virtuous
society
reflects
two
capital
weaknesses
in
the
speculation
of
the
encyclopaedist
period
a
failure
to
allow
for
the
strength
of
human
passions
and
interests
and
a
deficient
appreciation
of
the
meaning
of
liberty
much
as
the
reformers
acclaimed
and
fought
for
toleration
they
did
not
generally
comprehend
the
value
of
the
principle
they
did
not
see
that
in
a
society
organised
and
governed
by
reason
and
justice
themselves
the
unreserved
toleration
of
false
opinions
would
be
the
only
palladium
of
progress
or
that
a
doctrinaire
state
composed
of
perfectly
virtuous
and
deferential
people
would
arrest
development
and
stifle
origiality
by
its
ungenial
if
mild
tyranny
mercier
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
that
ideal
societies
are
always
repellent
and
there
are
probably
few
who
would
not
rather
be
set
down
in
athens
in
the
days
of
the
vile
aristophanes
whose
works
mercier
condemned
to
the
flames

bohemian
man

letters
restif

unedifying
novels

rejected

heroic
comedy

how
marriages
would
be
arranged

master

been
rousseau

it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
the
motif
and
title
of
his

suggested
by
the
romance

examples

caused
the

precipitated

the

had
a
better
prospect
of
improvement
than
it
ever
had
before
when
louis

came
to

the
theories
had
prepared
france
for
radical
changes
and
they
guided
the
phases
of
the
revolution
the
leaders
had
all
the
optimism
of
the
encyclopaedists
yet
the
most
powerful
single
force
was
rousseau
who
though
he
denied
progress
and
blasphemed
civilisation
had
promulgated
the
doctrine
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
giving
it
an
attractive
appearance

mathematical
precision
and
to
this
doctrine
the
revolutionaries
attached
their
optimistic
hopes
footnote
it
is
interesting
to
observe
how
robespierre
to
whom
the
doctrines
of
rousseau
were
oracles
could
break
out
into
admiration
of
the
progress
of

whereas
the

which
before
had

the
nearest
approximation
to
the

was
founded
on

the
enthusiasm

optimism
of
the
people
who
gathered
to
swear
loyalty
to
the
new
constitution
were
genuine
and
spontaneous
consciously
or
subconsciously
they
were
under
the
influence
of
the
doctrine
of
progress
which
leaders
of
opinion
had
for
several
decades
been
insinuating
into
the
public
mind
it
did
not
occur
to
them
that
their
oaths
and
fraternal
embraces
did
not
change
their
minds
or
hearts
and
that
as
taine
remarked
they
remained
what
ages
of
political
subjection
and
one
age
of
political
literature
had
made
them
the
assumption
that
new
social
machinery
could
alter
human
nature
and
create
a
heaven

to
be
swiftly
and
terribly
confuted
post

latium
was

fundamental
fallacy
into
which
all
the
philosophers
and
rousseau
had
more
or
less
fallen
was
reflected
and
exposed
by
the
revolution
they
had
considered

in

they
had
not
seen
that
the
whole
development
of
a
society
is
an
enormous
force
which
can
not
be
talked
or
legislated
away
they
had
ignored
the
power
of
social
memory
and
historical
traditions
and
misvalued
the
strength
of
the
links
which
bind
generations
together
so
the
revolutionaries
imagined
that
they
could
break
abruptly
with
the
past
and
that
a
new
method
of
government
constructed
on
mathematical
lines

created
by

terror
but
though
the
hopes
of
those
who
believed
in
the
speedy
regeneration
of
the
world
were
belied
some
of
the
thoughtful
did
not
lose
heart
there
was
one
at
least
who
did
not
waver
in
his
faith
that
the
movement
was
a
giant
step
on
the
path
of
man
towards
ultimate
felicity
however
far
he
had
still
to
travel
condorcet
one
of
the
younger
encyclopaedists
spent
the
last
months
of
his
life
under
the
menace
of
the
guillotine
in
projecting
a
history
of
human
progress
condorcet
was
the
friend
and
biographer
of
turgot
and
it
was
not
unfitting
that
he
should
resume
the
design
of
a
history
of
civilisation
in
the
light
of
the
idea
of
progress
for
which
turgot
had
only
left
luminous
suggestions
he
did
not
execute
the
plan
but
he
completed
an
elaborate
sketch
in
which
the
controlling
ideas
of
the
scheme
are
fully
set
forth
his
principles
are
to
be
found
almost
entirely
in
turgot
but
they
have
a
new
significance
for
condorcet
he
has
given
them
wings
he
has
emphasised
and
made
deductions
turgot
wrote
in
the
calm
spirit
of
an
inquirer
condorcet
spoke
with
the
verve
of
a
prophet
he
was
prophesying
under
the
shadow
of
death
it
is
amazing
that
the
optimistic
sketch
of
a
historical
picture
of
the
progress
of
the
human
mind
should
have
been
composed
when
he
was
hiding
from
robespierre
in
footnote
published
in
condorcet
was
penetrated
with
the
spirit
of
the
encyclopaedists
of
whom
he
had
been
one
and
his
attitude
to
christianity
was
that
of
voltaire
and
diderot
turgot
had
treated
the
received
religion
respectfully
he
had
acknowledged
providence
and
though
the
place
which
he
assigned
to
providence
was
that
of
a
sort
of
honorary
president
of
the
development
of
civilisation
who
might
disappear
without
affecting
the
proceedings
there
was
a
real
difference
between
his
views
and
those
of
his
friend
as
to
the
role
of
christianity
and
the
civilisation
of
the
middle
ages
a
more
important
difference
between
the
two
thinkers
is
connected
with
the
different
circumstances
in
which
they
wrote
turgot
did
not
believe
in
the
necessity
of
violent
changes
he
thought
that
steady
reforms
under
the
existing
regime
would
do
wonders
for
france
before
the
revolution
condorcet
had
agreed
but
he
was
swept
away
by
its
enthusiasm
the
victory
of
liberty
in
america
and
the
increasing
volume
of
the
movement
against
slavery
one
of
the
causes
which
most
deeply
stirred
his
heart
had
heightened
his
natural
optimism
and
confirmed
his
faith
in
the
dogma
of
progress
he
felt
the
exhilaration
of
the
belief
that
he
was
living
through
one
of
the
greatest
revolutions
of
the
human
race
and
he
deliberately
designed
his
book
to
be
opportune
to
a
crisis
of
mankind
at
which
a
picture
of
revolutions
of
the
past
will
be
the
best
guide
feeling
that
he
is
personally
doomed
he
consoles
himself
with
brooding
on
the
time
however
remote
when
the
sun
will
shine
on
an
earth
of
none
but
freemen
with
no
master
save
reason
for
tyrants
and
slaves
priests
and
their
stupid
or
hypocritical
tools
will
all
have
disappeared
he
is
not
satisfied
with
affirming
generally
the
certainty
of
an
indefinite
progress
in
enlightenment
and
social
welfare
he
sets
himself
to
think
out
its
nature
to
forecast
its
direction
and
determine
its
goal
and
insists
as
his
predecessors
had
never
done
on
the
prospects
of
the
distant
future
his
ambitious
design
is
in
his
own
words
to
show
the
successive
changes
in
human
society
the
influence
which
each
instant
exerts
on
the
succeeding
instant
and
thus
in
its
successive
modifications
the
advance
of
the
human
species
towards
truth
or
happiness
taken
literally
this
is
an
impossible
design
and
to
put
it
forward
as
a
practical
proposition
is
as
if
a
man
were
to
declare
his
intention
of
writing
a
minute
diary
of
the
life
of
julius
caesar
from
his
birth
to
his
death
by
stating
his
purpose
in
such
terms
condorcet
reveals
that
he
had
no
notion
of
the
limitations
which
confine
our
knowledge
of
the
past
and
that
even
if
he
had
conceived
a
more
modest
and
practicable
programme
he
would
have
been
incapable
of
executing
it
his
formula
however
is
worth
remembering
for
the
unattainable
ideal
which
it
expresses
reminds
us
how
many
periods
and
passages
of
human
experience
must
always
remain
books
with
seven
seals
condorcet
distinguished
ten
periods
of
civilisation
of
which
the
tenth
lies
in
the
future
but
he
has
not
justified
his
divisions
and
his
epochs
are
not
in
importance
yet
his
arrangement
of
the
map
of
history
is
remarkable
as
an
attempt
to
mark
its
sections
not
by
great
political
changes
but
by
important
steps
in
knowledge
the
first
three
periods
the
formation
of
primitive
societies
followed
by
the
pastoral
age
and
the
agricultural
age
conclude
with
the
invention
of
alphabetic
writing
in
greece
the
fourth
is
the
history
of
greek
thought
to
the
definite
division
of
the
sciences
in
the
time
of
aristotle
in
the
fifth
knowledge
progresses
and
suffers
obscuration
under
roman
rule
and
the
sixth
is
the
dark
age
which
continues
to
the
time
of
the
crusades
the
significance
of
the
seventh
period
is
to
prepare
the
human
mind
for
the
revolution
which
would
be
achieved
by
the
invention
of
printing
with
which
the
eighth
period
opens
some
of
the
best
pages
of
the
book
develop
the
vast
consequences
of
this
invention
the
scientific
revolution
effected
by
descartes
begins
a
new
period
which
is
now
closed
by
the
creation
of
the
french
republic
the
idea
of
the
progress
of
knowledge
had
created
the
idea
of
social
progress
and
remained
its
foundation
it
was
therefore
logical
and
inevitable
that
condorcet
should
take
advance
in
knowledge
as
the
clew
to
the
march
of
the
human
race
the
history
of
civilisation
is
the
history
of
enlightenment
turgot
had
justified
this
axiom
by
formulating
the
cohesion
of
all
modes
of
social
activity
condorcet
insists
on
the
indissoluble
union
between
intellectual
progress
and
that
of
liberty
virtue
and
the
respect
for
natural
rights
and
on
the
effect
of
science
in
the
destruction
of
prejudice
all
errors
in
politics
and
ethics
have
sprung
he
asserts
from
false
ideas
which
are
closely
connected
with
errors
in
physics
and
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
nature
and
in
the
new
doctrine
of
progress
he
sees
an
instrument
of
enlightenment
which
is
to
give
the
last
blow
to
the
tottering
edifice
of
prejudices
it
would
not
be
useful
to
analyse
condorcet
sketch
or
dwell
on
his
obsolete
errors
and
the
defects
of
his
historical
knowledge
his
slight
picture
of
the
middle
ages
reflects
the
familiar
view
of
all
the
eighteenth
century
philosophers
the
only
contribution
to
social
amelioration
which
he
can
discover
in
a
period
of
nearly
a
millennium
is
the
abolition
of
domestic
slavery
and
so
this
period
appears
as
an
interruption
of
the
onward
march
his
inability
to
appreciate
the
historical
role
of
the
roman
empire
exhibits
more
surprising
ignorance
and
prejudice
but
these
particular
defects
are
largely
due
to
a
fundamental
error
which
runs
through
his
whole
book
and
was
inherent
in
the
social
speculations
of
the
encyclopaedists
condorcet
like
all
his
circle
ignored
the
preponderant
part
which
institutions
have
played
in
social
development
so
far
as
he
considered
them
at
all
he
saw
in
them
obstacles
to
the
free
play
of
human
reason
not
the
spontaneous
expression
of
a
society
corresponding
to
its
needs
or
embodying
its
ideals
but
rather
machinery
deliberately
contrived
for
oppressing
the
masses
and
keeping
them
in
chains
he
did
not
see
that
if
the
progress
in
which
he
believed
is
a
reality
its
possibility
depends
on
the
institutions
and
traditions
which
give
to
societies
their
stability
in
the
following
generation
it
would
be
pointed
out
that
he
fell
into
a
manifest
contradiction
when
he
praised
the
relative
perfection
reached
in
some
european
countries
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
at
the
same
time
condemned
as
eminently
retrograde
all
the
doctrines
and
institutions
which
had
been
previously
in
control

they
suggest
he
undertakes
to
show
that
nature
has
set
no
term
to
the
process
of
improving
human
faculties
and
that
the
advance
towards
perfection
is
limited
only
by
the
duration
of
the
globe
the
movement
may
vary
in
velocity
but
it
will
never
be
retrograde
so
long
as
the
earth
occupies
its
present
place
in
the
cosmic
system
and
the
general
laws
of
this
system
do
not
produce
some
catastrophe
or
change
which
would
deprive
the
human
race
of
the
faculties
and
resources
which
it
has
hitherto
possessed
there
will
be
no
relapse
into
barbarism
the
guarantees
against
this
danger
are
the
discovery
of
true
methods
in
the
physical
sciences
their
application
to
the
needs
of
men
the
lines
of
communication
which
have
been
established
among
them
the
great
number
of
those
who
study
them
and
finally
the
art
of
printing
and
if
we
are
sure
of
the
continuous
progress
of
enlightenment
we
may
be
sure
of
the
continuous
improvement
of
social
conditions
it
is
possible
to
foresee
events
if
the
general
laws
of
social
phenomena
are
known
and
these
laws
can
be
inferred
from
the
history
of
the
past
by
this
statement
condorcet
justifies
his
bold
attempt
to
sketch
his
tenth
period
of
human
history
which
lies
in
the
future
and
announces
the
idea
which
was
in
the
next
generation
to
be
worked
out
by
comte
but
he
can
not
be
said
to
have
deduced
himself
any
law
of
social
development
his
forecast
of
the
future
is
based
on
the
ideas
and
tendencies
of
his
own
age
footnote
it
is
interesting
to
notice
that
the
ablest
of
medieval
arabic
historians
ibn
khaldun
fourteenth
century
had
claimed
that
if
history
is
scientifically
studied
future
events
may
be
predicted
apart
from
scientific
discoveries
and
the
general
diffusion
of
a
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
nature
on
which
moral
improvement
depends
he
includes
in
his
prophetic
vision
the
cessation
of
war
and
the
realisation
of
the
less
familiar
idea
of
the
equality
of
the
sexes
if
he
were
alive
he
could
point
with
triumph
to
the
fact
that
of
these
projects
one
is
being
accomplished
in
some
of
the
most
progressive
countries
and
the
other
is
looked
upon
as
an
attainable
aim
by
statesmen
who
are
not
visionaries
the
equality
of
the
sexes
was
only
a
logical
inference
from
the
general
doctrine
of
equality
to
which
condorcet
social
theory
is
reducible
for
him
the
goal
of
political
progress
is
equality
equality
is
to
be
the
aim
of
social
effort
the
ideal
of
the
revolution
for
it
is
the
multitude
of
men
that
must
be
considered
the
mass
of
workers
not
the
minority
who
live
on
their
labours
hitherto
they
have
been
neglected
by
the
historian
as
well
as
by
the
statesman
the
true
history
of
humanity
is
not
the
history
of
some
men
the
human
race
is
formed
by
the
mass
of
families
who
subsist
almost
entirely
on
the
fruits
of
their
own
work
and
this
mass
is
the
proper
subject
of
history
not
great
men
you
may
establish
social
equality
by
means
of
laws
and
institutions
yet
the
equality
actually
enjoyed
may
be
very
incomplete
condorcet
recognises
this
and
attributes
it
to
three
principal
causes
inequality
in
wealth
inequality
in
position
between
the
man
whose
means
of
subsistence
are
assured
and
can
be
transmitted
to
his
family
and
the
man
whose
means
depend
on
his
work
and
are
limited
by
the
term
of
his
own
life
footnote
he
looked
forward
to
the
mitigation
of
this
inequality
by
the
development
of
life
insurance
which
was
then
coming
to
the
front
and
inequality
in
education
he
did
not
propose
any
radical
methods
for
dealing
with
these
difficulties
which
he
thought
would
diminish
in
time
without
however
entirely
disappearing
he
was
too
deeply
imbued
with
the
views
of
the
economists
to
be
seduced
by
the
theories
of
rousseau
mably
babeuf
and
others
into
advocating
communism
or
the
abolition
of
private
property
besides
equality
among
the
individuals
composing
a
civilised
society
condorcet
contemplated
equality
among
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
a
uniform
civilisation
throughout
the
world
and
the
obliteration
of
the
distinction
between
advanced
and
retrograde
races
the
backward
peoples
he
prophesied
will
climb
up
to
the
condition
of
france
and
the
united
states
of
america
for
no
people
is
condemned
never
to
exercise
its
reason
if
the
dogma
of
the
perfectibility
of
human
nature
unguarded
by
any
restrictions
is
granted
this
is
a
logical
inference
and
we
have
already
seen
that
it
was
one
of
the
ideas
current
among
the
philosophers
condorcet
does
not
hesitate
to
add
to
his
picture
adventurous
conjectures
on
the
improvement
of
man
physical
organisation
and
a
considerable
prolongation
of
his
life
by
the
advance
of
medical
science
we
need
only
note
this
more
interesting
is
the
prediction
that
even
if
the
compass
of
the
human
being
cerebral
powers
is
inalterable
the
range
precision
and
rapidity
of
his
mental
operations
will
be
augmented
by
the
invention
of
new
instruments
and
methods
the
design
of
writing
a
history
of
human
civilisation
was
premature
and
to
have
produced
a
survey
of
any
durable
value
would
have
required
the
equipment
of
a
gibbon
condorcet
was
not
even
as
well
equipped
as
voltaire
footnote
but
as
he
wrote
without
books
the
sketch
was
a
marvellous
tour
de
force
the
significance
of
his
sketch
lies
in
this
that
towards
the
close
of
an
intellectual
movement
it
concentrated
attention
on
the
most
important
though
hitherto
not
the
most
prominent
idea
which
that
movement
had
disseminated
and
as
it
were
officially
announced
human
progress
as
the
leading
problem
that
claimed
the
interest
of
mankind
with
him
progress
was
associated
intimately
with
particular
eighteenth
century
doctrines
but
these
were
not
essential
to
it
it
was
a
living
idea
it
survived
the
compromising
theories
which
began
to
fall
into
discredit
after
the
revolution
and
was
explored
from
new
points
of
view
condorcet
however
wedded
though
his
mind
was
to
the
untenable
views
of
human
nature
current
in
his
epoch
and
his
circle
did
not
share
the
tendency
of
leading
philosophers
to
regard
history
as
an
unprofitable
record
of
folly
and
crime
which
it
would
be
well
to
obliterate
or
forget
he
recognised
the
interpretation
of
history
as
the
key
to
human
development
and
this
principle
controlled
subsequent
speculations
on
progress
in
france
cabanis
the
physician
was
condorcet
literary
executor
and
a
no
less
ardent
believer
in
human
perfectibility
looking
at
life
and
man
from
his
own
special
point
of
view
he
saw
in
the
study
of
the
physical
organism
the
key
to
the
intellectual
and
moral
improvement
of
the
race
it
is
by
knowledge
of
the
relations
between
his
physical
states
and
moral
states
that
man
can
attain
happiness
through
the
enlargement
of
his
faculties
and
the
multiplication
of
enjoyments
and
that
he
will
be
able
to
grasp
as
it
were
the
infinite
in
his
brief
existence
by
realising
the
certainty
of
indefinite
progress
his
doctrine
was
a
logical
extension
of
the
theories
of
locke
and
condillac
if
our
knowledge
is
wholly
derived
from
sensations
our
sensations
depend
on
our
sensory
organs
and

becomes
a
function
of
the
nervous
system
the
events
of
the
revolution
quenched
in
him
as
little
as
in
condorcet
the
sanguine
confidence
that
it
was
the
opening
of
a
new
era
for
science
and
art
and
thereby
for
the
general
progress

chapter

the
theory
of
progress
in
england
the
idea
of
progress
could
not
help
crossing
the
channel
france
and
england
had
been
at
war
in
the
first
year
of
the
eighteenth
century
they
were
at
war
in
the
last
and
their
conflict
for
supremacy
was
the
leading
feature
of
the
international
history
of
the
whole
century
but
at
no
period
was
there
more
constant
intellectual
intimacy
or
more
marked
reciprocal
influence
between
the
two
countries
it
was
a
commonplace
that
paris
and
london
were
the
two
great
foci
of
civilisation
and
they
never
lost
touch
of
each
other
in
the
intellectual
sphere
many
of
the
principal
works
of
literature
that
appeared
in
either
country
were
promptly
translated
and
some
of
the
french
books
which
the
censorship
rendered
it
dangerous
to
publish
in
paris
were
printed
in
london
it
was
not
indeed
to
be
expected
that
the
theory
should
have
the
same
kind
of
success
or
exert
the
same
kind
of
effect
in
england
as
in
france
england
had
her
revolution
behind
her
france
had
hers
before
her
england
enjoyed
what
were
then
considered
large
political
liberties
the
envy
of
other
lands
france
groaned
under
the
tyranny
of
worthless
rulers
the
english
constitution
satisfied
the
nation
and
the
serious
abuses
which
would
now
appear
to
us
intolerable
were
not
sufficient
to
awaken
a
passionate
desire
for
reforms
the
general
tendency
of
british
thought
was
to
see
salvation
in
the
stability
of
existing
institutions
and
to
regard
change
with
suspicion
now
passionate
desire
for
reform
was
the
animating
force
which
propagated
the
idea
of
progress
in
france
and
when
this
idea
is
translated
from
the
atmosphere
of
combat
in
which
it
was
developed
by
french
men
of
letters
into
the
calm
climate
of
england
it
appears
like
a
cold
reflection
again
english
thinkers
were
generally
inclined
to
hold
with
locke
that
the
proper
function
of
government
is
principally
negative
to
preserve
order
and
defend
life
and
property
not
to
aim
directly
at
the
improvement
of
society
but
to
secure
the
conditions
in
which
men
may
pursue
their
own
legitimate
aims
most
of
the
french
theorists
believed
in
the
possibility
of
moulding
society
indefinitely
by
political
action
and
rested
their
hopes
for
the
future
not
only
on
the
achievements
of
science
but
on
the
enlightened
activity
of
governments
this
difference
of
view
tended
to
give
to
the
doctrine
of
progress
in
france
more
practical
significance
than
in
england
but
otherwise
british
soil
was
ready
to
receive
the
idea
there
was
the
same
optimistic
temper
among
the
comfortable
classes
in
both
countries
shaftesbury

deist
had
struck
this
note
at

not

the
superiority

to

this
superiority
forms
indeed
the
minor
premiss
in
the
general
argument

confuted

the
most
considerable
contribution
made
by
british
thinkers
of
the
age
to
the
study

much
more
than

at

french
economists
on
the
value
of
opulence
for
the
civilisation

happiness
of

it
was
indirectly
perhaps
that
his
work
contributed
most
effectively
to
the
doctrine

been
observed

one
passage
from
priestley
the
most
eminent
of
the
three
and
the
most
enthusiastic
for
the
progress
of
man
as
the
division
of
labour
the
chief
principle
of
organised
society
is
carried
further
he
anticipates
that
nature
including
both
its
materials
and
its
laws
will
be
more
at
our
command
men
will
make
their
situation
in
this
world
abundantly
more
easy
and
comfortable
they
will
probably
prolong
their
existence
in
it
and
will
grow
daily
more
happy
thus
whatever
was
the
beginning
of
this
world
the
end
will
be
glorious
and
paradisiacal
beyond
what
our
imaginations
can
now
conceive
extravagant
as
some
people
may
suppose
these
views
to
be
i
think
i
could
show
them
to
be
fairly
suggested
by
the
true
theory
of
human
nature
and
to
arise
from
the
natural
course
of
human
affairs
footnote
this
passage
of
priestley
occurs
in
his
essay
on
the
first
principles
of
government
and
on
the
nature
of
political
civil
and
religious
liberty
ed
pp
his
lectures
on
history
and
general
policy
appeared
in
priestley
was
a
strict
utilitarian
who
held
that
there
is
nothing
intrinsically
excellent
in
justice
and
veracity
apart
from
their
relation
to
happiness
the
degree
of
public
happiness
is
measured
by
the
excellence
of
religion
science
government
laws
arts
commerce
conveniences
of
life
and
especially
by
the
degrees
of
personal
security
and
personal
liberty
in
all
these
the
ancients
were
inferior
and
therefore
they
enjoyed
less
happiness
the
present
state
of
europe
is
vastly
preferable
to
what
it
was
in
any
former
period
and
the
plan
of
this
divine
drama
is
opening
more
and
more
in
the
future
knowledge
will
increase
and
accumulate
and
diffuse
itself
to
the
lower
ranks
of
society
who
by
degrees
will
find
leisure
for
speculation
and
looking
beyond
their
immediate
employment
they
will
consider
the
complex
machine
of
society
and
in
time
understand
it
better
than
those
who
now
write
about
it
see
his
lectures
pp
the
english
thinker
did
not
share
all
the
views
of
his
french
masters
as
a
unitarian
he
regarded
christianity
as
a
great
remedy
of
vice
and
ignorance
part
of
the
divine
plan
and
he
ascribed
to
government
a
lesser
role
than
they
in
the
improvement
of
humanity
he
held
for
instance
that
the
state
should
not
interfere
in
education
arguing
that
this
art
was
still
in
the
experimental
stage
and
that
the
intervention
of
the
civil
power
might
stereotype
a
bad
system
not
less
significant
though
less
influential
than
the
writings
of
priestley
and
ferguson
was
the
work
of
james
dunbar
professor
of
philosophy
at
aberdeen
entitled
essays
on
the
history
of
mankind
in
rude
and
cultivated
ages
he
conceived
history
as
progressive
and
inquired
into
the
general
causes
which
determine
the
gradual
improvements
of
civilisation
he
dealt
at
length
with
the
effects
of
climate
and
local
circumstances
but
unlike
the
french
philosophers
did
not
ignore
heredity
while
he
did
not
enter
upon
any
discussion
of
future
developments
he
threw
out
incidentally
the
idea
that
the
world
may
be
united
in
a
league
of
nations
posterity
he
wrote
may
contemplate
from
a
concurrence
of
various
causes
and
events
some
of
which
are
hastening
into
light
the
greater
part
or
even
the
whole
habitable
globe
divided
among
nations
free
and
independent
in
all
the
interior
functions
of
government
forming
one
political
and
commercial
system
dunbar
was
an
optimistic
book
but
his
optimism
was
more
cautious
than
priestley
these
are
his
final
words
if
human
nature
is
liable
to
degenerate
it
is
capable
of
proportionable
improvement
from
the
collected
wisdom
of
ages
it
is
pleasant
to
infer
from
the
actual
progress
of
society
the
glorious
possibilities
of
human
excellence
and
if
the
principles
can
be
assembled
into
view
which
most
directly
tend
to
diversify
the
genius
and
character
of
nations
some
theory
may
be
raised
on
these
foundations
that
shall
account
more
systematically
for
past
occurrences
and
afford
some
openings
and
anticipations
into
the
eventual
history
of
the
world
the
problem
of
dark
ages
which
an
advocate
of
progress
must
explain
was
waved
away
by
priestley
in
his
lectures
on
history
with
the
observation
that
they
help
the
subsequent
advance
of
knowledge
by
breaking
the
progress
of
authority
footnote
this
was
doubtless
suggested
to
him
by
some
remarks
of
hume
in
the
rise
of
arts
and
sciences
this
is
not
much
of
a
plea
for
such
periods
viewed
as
machinery
in
a
providential
plan
the
great
history
of
the
middle
ages
which
in
the
words
of
its
author
describes
the
triumph
of
barbarism
and
religion
had
been
completed
before
priestley
lectures
appeared
and
it
is
remarkable
that
he
takes
no
account
of
it
though
it
might
seem
to
be
a
work
with
which
a
theory
of
progress
must
come
to
terms
yet
the
sceptical
historian
of
the
decline
and
fall
of
the
roman
empire
who
was
more
at
home
in
french
literature
than
any
of
his
was
not
opposed
to
the
theory
of
progress
and
he
even
states
it
in
a
moderate
form
having
given
reasons
for
believing
that
civilised
society
will
never
again
be
threatened
by
such
an
irruption
of
barbarians
as
that
which
oppressed
the
arms
and
institutions
of
rome
he
allows
us
to
acquiesce
in
the
pleasing
conclusion
that
every
age
of
the
world
has
increased
and
still
increases
the
real
wealth
the
happiness
the
knowledge
and
perhaps
the
virtue
of
the
human
race
the
discoveries
of
ancient
and
modern
navigators
and
the
domestic
history
or
tradition
of
the
most
enlightened
nations
represent
the
human
savage
naked
both
in
mind
and
body
and
destitute
of
laws
of
arts
of
ideas
and
almost
of
language
from
this
abject
condition
perhaps
the
primitive
and
universal
state
of
man
he
has
gradually
arisen
to
command
the
animals
to
fertilise
the
earth
to
traverse
the
ocean
and
to
measure
the
heavens
his
progress
in
the
improvement
and
exercise
of
his
mental
and
corporeal
faculties
has
been
irregular
and
various
infinitely
slow
in
the
beginning
and
increasing
by
degrees
with
redoubled
velocity
ages
of
laborious
ascent
have
been
followed
by
a
moment
of
rapid
downfall
and
the
several
climates
of
the
globe
have
felt
the
vicissitudes
of
light
and
darkness
yet
the
experience
of
four
thousand
years
should
enlarge
our
hopes
and
diminish
our
apprehensions
we
can
not
determine
to
what
height
the
human
species
may
aspire
in
their
advances
towards
perfection
but
it
may
safely
be
presumed
that
no
people

the
face
of

will
relapse
into
their
original
barbarism
footnote
decline

the

ch
xxxviii
ad
fin
but
gibbon
treats
the
whole
subject
as
a
speculation
and
he
treats
it
without
reference
to
any
of
the
general
principles
on
which
french
thinkers
had
based
their
theory
he
admits
that
his
reasons
for
holding
that
civilisation
is
secure
against
a
barbarous
cataclysm
may
be
considered
fallacious
and
he
also
contemplates
the
eventuality
that
the
fabric
of
sciences
and
arts
trade
and
manufacture
law
and
policy
might
be
decayed
by
time
if
so
the
growth
of
civilisation
would
have
to
begin
again
but
not
ab
initio
for
the
more
useful
or
at
least
more
necessary
arts
which
do
not
require
superior
talents
or
national
subordination
for
their
exercise
and
which
war
commerce
and
religious
zeal
have
spread
among
the
savages
of
the
world

certainly
survive
these
remarks
are
no
more
than
obiter
dicta
but
they
show
how
the
doctrine
of
progress
was
influencing
those
who
were
temperamentally
the
least
likely
to
subscribe
to
extravagant
theories
the
outbreak
of
the
french
revolution
evoked
a
sympathetic
movement
among
english
progressive
thinkers
which
occasioned
the
government
no
little
alarm
the
dissenting
minister
richard
price
whose
observations
on
civil
liberty
defending
the
action
of
the
american
colonies
had
enjoyed
an
immense
success
preached
the
sermon
which
provoked
burke
to
write
his
reflections
and
priestley
no
less
enthusiastic
in
welcoming
the
revolution
replied
to
burke
the
government
resorted
to
tyrannous
measures
young
men
who
sympathised
with
the
french
movement
and
agitated
for
reforms
at
home
were
sent
to
botany
bay
paine

but
the
most
important
speculative
work
of
the
time
william
godwin
political
justice
escaped
the
censorship
because
it
was
not
published
at
a
popular
price
footnote
godwin
had
helped
to
get
paine
book
published
in
and
he
was
intimate
with
the
group
of
revolutionary
spirits
who
were
persecuted
by
the
government
a
good
account
of
the
episode
will
be
found
in
brailsford
shelley
godwin
and
their
circle
the
enquiry
concerning
political
justice
begun
in
appeared
in
the
second
edition
three
years
later
shows
the
influence
of
condorcet
sketch
which
had
appeared
in
the
meantime
godwin
says
that
his
original
idea
was
to
produce
a
work
on
political
science
to
supersede
montesquieu
the
note
of
montesquieu
political
philosophy
was
respect
for
social
institutions
godwin
principle
was
that
social
institutions
are
entirely
pernicious
that
they
perpetuate
harmful
prejudices
and
are
an
almost
insuperable
obstacle
to
improvement
if
he
particularly
denounced
monarchical
government
he
regarded
all
government
as
evil
and
held
that
social
progress
would
consist
not
in
the
reformation
of
government
but
in
its
abolition
while
he
recognised
that
man
had
progressed
in
the
past
he
considered
history
mainly
a
sequence
of
horrors
and
he
was
incapable
of
a
calm
survey
of
the
course
of
civilisation
in
english
institutions
he
saw
nothing
that
did
not
outrage
the
principles
of
justice
and
benevolence
the
present
state
of
humanity
is
about
as
bad
as
it
could
be
it
is
easy
to
see
the
deep
influence
which
the
teaching
of
rousseau
exercised
on
godwin
without
accepting
the
theory
of
arcadia
godwin
followed
him
in
unsparing
condemnation
of
existing
conditions
rousseau
and
godwin
are
the
two
great
champions
in
the
eighteenth
century
of
the
toiling
and
suffering
masses
but
godwin
drew
the
logical
conclusion
from
rousseau
premisses
which
rousseau
hesitated
to
draw
himself
the
french
thinker
while
he
extolled
the
anarchical
state
of
uncivilised
society
and
denounced
government
as
one
of
the
sources
of
its
corruption
nevertheless
sought
the
remedy
in
new
social
and
political
institutions
godwin
said
boldly
government
is
the
evil
government
must
go
humanity
can
never
be
happy
until
all
political
authority
and
social
institutions
disappear
now
the
peculiarity
of
godwin
position
as
a
doctrinaire
of
progress
lies
in
the
fact
that
he
entertained
the
same
pessimistic
view
of
some
important
sides
of
civilisation
as
rousseau
and
at
the
same
time
adopted
the
theories
of
rousseau
opponents
especially
helvetius
his
survey
of
human
conditions
seems
to
lead
inevitably
to
pessimism
then
he
turns
round
and
proclaims
the
doctrine
of
perfectibility
the
explanation
of
this
argument
was
the
psychological
theory
of
helvetius
he
taught
as
we
saw
and
godwin
developed
the
view
in
his
own
way
that
the
natures
and
characters
of
men
are
moulded
entirely
by
their
environment
not
physical
but
intellectual
and
moral
environment
and
therefore
can
be
indefinitely
modified
a
man
is
born
into
the
world
without
innate
tendencies
his
conduct
depends
on
his
opinions
alter
men
opinions
and
they
will
act
differently
make
their
opinions
conformable
to
justice
and
benevolence
and
you
will
have
a
just
and
benevolent
society
virtue
as
socrates
taught
is
simply
a
question
of
knowledge
the
situation
therefore
is
not
hopeless
for
it
is
not
due
to
the
radical
nature
of
man
it
is
caused
by
ignorance
and
prejudice
by
governments
and
institutions
by
kings
and
priests
transform
the
ideas
of
men
and
society
will
be
transformed
the
french
philosopher
considered
that
a
reformed
system
of
educating
children
would
be
one
of
the
most
powerful
means
for
promoting
progress
and
bringing
about
the
reign
of
reason
and
condorcet
worked
out
a
scheme
of
universal
state
education
this
was
entirely
opposed
to
godwin
principles
state
schools
would
only
be
another
instrument
of
power
in
the
hands
of
a
government
worse
even
than
a
state
church
they
would
strengthen
the
poisonous
influence
of
kings
and
statesmen
and
establish
instead
of
abolishing
prejudices
he
seems
to
have
relied
entirely
on
the
private
efforts
of
enlightened
thinkers
to
effect
a
gradual
conversion
of
public
opinion
in
his
study
of
the
perfectibility
of
man
and
the
prospect
of
a
future
reign
of
general
justice
and
benevolence
godwin
was
even
more
visionary
than
condorcet
as
in
his
political
views
he
was
more
radical
than
the
revolutionists
condorcet
had
at
least
sought
to
connect
his
picture
of
the
future
with
a
reasoned
survey
of
the
past
and
to
find
a
chain
of
connection
but
the
perfectibility
of
godwin
hung
in
the
air
supported
only
by
an
abstract
theory
of
the
nature
of
man
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
he
contributed
anything
to
the
theoretical
problem
of
civilisation
his
significance
is
that
he
proclaimed
in
england
at
an
opportune
moment
and
in
a
more
impressive
and
startling
way
than
a
sober
apostle
like
priestley
the
creed
of
progress
taught
by
french
philosophers
though
considerably
modified
by
his
own
anarchical
opinions
perfectibility
as
expounded
by
condorcet
and
godwin
encountered
a
drastic
criticism
from
malthus
whose
essay
on
the
principle
of
population
appeared
in
its
first
form
anonymously
in
condorcet
had
foreseen
an
objection
which
might
be
raised
as
fatal
to
the
realisation
of
his
future
state
will
not
the
progress
of
industry
and
happiness
cause
a
steady
increase
in
population
and
must
not
the
time
come
when
the
number
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
globe
will
surpass
their
means
of
subsistence
condorcet
did
not
grapple
with
this
question
he
contented
himself
with
saying
that
such
a
period
must
be
very
far
away
and
that
by
then
the
human
race
will
have
achieved
improvements
of
which
we
can
now
scarcely
form
an
idea
similarly
godwin
in
his
fancy
picture
of
the
future
happiness
of
mankind
notices
the
difficulty
and
shirks
it
of
the
habitable
globe
are
now
uncultivated
the
parts
already
cultivated
are
capable
of
immeasurable
improvement
myriads
of
centuries
of
still
increasing
population
may
pass
away
and
the
earth
be
still
found
sufficient
for
the
subsistence
of
its
inhabitants
malthus
argued
that
these
writers
laboured
under
an
illusion
as
to
the
actual
relations
between
population
and
the
means
of
subsistence
in
present
conditions
the
numbers
of
the
race
are
only
kept
from
increasing
far
beyond
the
means
of
subsistence
by
vice
misery
and
the
fear
of
misery
footnote
this
observation
had
been
made
as
hazlitt
pointed
out
before
malthus
by
robert
wallace
see
a
dissertation
on
the
numbers
of
mankind
it
was
another
book
of
wallace
that
suggested
the
difficulty
to
godwin
in
the
conditions
imagined
by
condorcet
and
godwin
these
checks
are
removed
and
consequently
the
population
would
increase
with
great
rapidity
doubling
itself
at
least
in
years
but
the
products
of
the
earth
increase
only
in
an
arithmetical
progression
and
in
fifty
years
the
food
supply
would
be
too
small
for
the
demand
thus
the
oscillation
between
numbers
and
food
supply
would
recur
and
the
happiness
of
the
species
would
come
to
an
end
godwin
and
his
adherents
could
reply
that
one
of
the
checks
on
is
prudential
restraint
which
malthus
himself
recognised
and
that
this
would
come
more
extensively
into
operation
with
that
progress
of
enlightenment
which
their
theory
assumed
footnote
this
is
urged
by
hazlitt
in
his
criticism
of
malthus
in
the
spirit
of
the
age
but
the
criticisms
of
malthus
dealt
a
trenchant
blow
to
the
doctrine
that
human
reason
acting
through
legislation
and
government
has
a
virtually
indefinite
power
of
modifying
the
condition
of
society
the
difficulty
which
he
stated
so
vividly
and
definitely
was
well
calculated
to
discredit
the
doctrine
and
to
suggest
that
the
development
of
society
could
be
modified
by
the
conscious
efforts
of
man
only
within
restricted
limits

is
to
be
observed
that
in
these
socialist
theories
the
conception
of

as
indefinite
tends
to
vanish
or
to
lose
its
significance
if
the
millennium
can
be
brought
about
at

stroke

a
certain
arrangement

is
achieved

have
reached

and
shall
have
only
to
live

enjoy
the
ideal
state
a
menagerie
of
happy
men
there
will
be
room
for
further
perhaps
indefinite
advance
in
knowledge
but
civilisation
in
its
social
character
becomes
stable
and
rigid
once
man
needs
are
perfectly
satisfied
in
a
harmonious
environment
there
is
no
stimulus
to
cause
further
changes
and
the
dynamic
character
of
history
disappears
theories
of
progress
are
thus
differentiating
into
two
distinct
types
corresponding
to
two
radically
opposed
political
theories
and
appealing
to
two
antagonistic
temperaments
the
one
type
is
that
of
constructive
idealists
and
socialists
who
can
name
all
the
streets
and
towers
of
the
city
of
gold
which
they
imagine
as
situated
just
round
a
promontory
the
development
of
man
is
a
closed
system
its
term
is
known
and
is
within
reach
the
other
type
is
that
of
those
who
surveying
the
gradual
ascent
of
man
believe
that
by
the
same
interplay
of
forces
which
have
conducted
him
so
far
and
by
a
further
development
of
the
liberty
which
he
has
fought
to
win
he
will
move
slowly
towards
conditions
of
increasing
harmony
and
happiness
here
the
development
is
indefinite
its
term
is
unknown
and
lies
in
the
remote
future
individual
liberty
is
the
motive
force
and
the
corresponding
political
theory
is
liberalism
whereas
the
first
doctrine
naturally
leads
to
a
symmetrical
system
in
which
the
authority
of
the
state
is
preponderant
and
the
individual
has
little
more
value
than
a
cog
in
a
wheel
his
place
is
assigned
it
is
not
his
right
to
go
his
own
way
of
this
type
the
principal
example
that
is
not
socialistic
is
as
we
shall
see
the
philosophy
of
comte
chapter
xiii
german
speculations
on
progress
the
philosophical
views
current
in
germany
during
the
period
in
which
the
psychology
of
locke
was
in
fashion
in
france
and
before
the
genius
of
kant
opened
a
new
path
were
based
on
the
system
of
leibnitz
we
might
therefore
expect
to
find
a
theory
of
progress
developed
there
parallel
to
the
development
in
france
though
resting
on
different
principles
for
leibnitz
as
we
saw
provided
in
his
cosmic
optimism
a
basis
for
the
doctrine
of
human
progress
and
he
had
himself
incidentally
pointed
to
it
this
development
however
was
delayed
it
was
only
towards
the
close
of
the
period
which
is
commonly
known
as
the
age
of
illumination
that
progress
came
to
the
front
and
it
is
interesting
to
observe
the
reason
wolf
was
the
leading
successor
and
interpreter
of
leibnitz
he
constrained
that
thinker
ideas
into
a
compact
logical
system
which
swayed
germany
till
kant
swept
it
away
in
such
cases
it
usually
happens
that
some
striking
doctrines
and
tendencies
of
the
master
are
accentuated
and
enforced
while
others
are
suffered
to
drop
out
of
sight
so
it
was
here
in
the
wolfian
system
leibnitz
conception
of
development
was
suffered
to
drop
out
of
sight
and
the
dynamic
element
which
animated
his
speculation
disappeared
in
particular
he
had
laid
down
that
the
sum
of
motive
forces
in
the
physical
world
is
constant
his
disciples
proceeded
to
the
inference
that
the
sum
of
morality
in
the
ethical
world
is
constant
this
dogma
obviously
eliminates
the
possibility
of
ethical
improvement
for
collective
humanity
and
so
we
find
mendelssohn
who
was
the
popular
exponent
of
wolf
philosophy
declaring
that
progress
is
only
for
the
individual
but
that
the
whole
of
humanity
here
below
in
the
course
of
time
shall
always
progress
and
perfect
itself
seems
to
me
not
to
have
been
the
purpose

the

induced
some
thinkers
to
turn
from
the
dry
bones
of
wolf
to
the
spirit
of
leibnitz
himself

at
the

time

in

may
venture
to
say
singularly
wanting
in
argumentative
force

thesis
is
that
the

explained

the

man
by
a
progressive
series
of
religions

of
history
proclaimed
progress
but
assumed
an
ideal
and
applied
a
measure
very
different
from
those
of
the
french
philosophers
the
goal
is
not
social
happiness
but
a
full
comprehension
of
god
philosophy
of
religion
is
made
the
key
to
the
philosophy
of
history
the
work
does
not
amount
to
more
than
a
suggestion
for
a
new
synthesis
but
it
was
opportune
and
arresting
herder
meanwhile
had
been
thinking
and
in
he
gave
the
german
world
his
survey
of
man
career
ideas
of
the
philosophy
of
the
history
of
humanity
in
this
famous
work
in
which
we
can
mark
the
influence
of
french
thinkers
especially
montesquieu
as
well
as
of
leibnitz
he
attempted
though
on
very
different
lines
the
same
task
which
turgot
and
condorcet
planned
a
universal
history
of
civilisation
the
deity
designed
the
world
but
never
interferes
in
its
process
either
in
the
physical
cosmos
or
in
human
history
human
history
itself
civilisation
is
a
purely
natural
phenomenon
events
are
strictly
enchained
continuity
is
unbroken
what
happened
at
any
given
time
could
have
happened
only
then
and
nothing
else
could
have
happened
herder
rigid
determinism
not
only
excludes
voltaire
chance
but
also
suppresses
the
free
play
of
man
intelligent
will
man
can
not
guide
his
own
destinies
his
actions
and
fortunes
are
determined
by
the
nature
of
things
his
physical
organisation
and
physical
environment
the
fact
that
god
exists
in
inactive
ease
hardly
affects
the
fatalistic
complexion
of
this
philosophy
but
it
is
perhaps
a
mitigation
that
the
world
was
made
for
man
humanity
is
its
final
cause
the
variety
of
the
phases
of
civilisation
that
have
appeared
on
earth
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
possible
manifestations
of
human
nature
are
very
numerous
and
that
they
must
all
be
realised
the
lower
forms
are
those
in
which
the
best
which
means
the
most
human
faculties
of
our
nature
are
undeveloped
the
highest
has
not
yet
been
realised
the
flower
of
humanity
captive
still
in
its
germ
will
blossom
out
one
day
into
the
true
form
of
man
like
unto
god
in
a
state
of
which
no
terrestrial
man
can
imagine
the
greatness
and
the
majesty

herder
is
not
a
systematic
thinker
indeed
his
work
abounds
in
contradictions
and
he
has
not
made
it
clear
how
far
this
full
epiphany
results
from
the
experiences
of
mankind
in
preceding
phases
he
believes
that
life
is
an
education
for
humanity
he
has
taken
the
phrase
of
lessing
that
good
progressively
develops
that
reason
and
justice
become
more
powerful
this
is
a
doctrine
of
progress
but
he
distinctly
opposes
the
hypothesis
of
a
final
and
unique
state
of
perfection
as
the
goal
of
history
which
would
imply
that
earlier
generations
exist
for
the
sake
of
the
later
and
suffer
in
order
to
ensure
the
felicity
of
remote
posterity
a
theory
which
offends
his
sense
of
justice
and
fitness
on
the
contrary
man
can
realise
happiness
equally
in
every
stage
of
civilisation
all
forms
of
society
are
equally
legitimate
the
imperfect

all
are

not
mere
stages
on
the
way
to
something
better
and
a
people
which
is
happy
in
one
of
these
inferior
states
has
a
perfect
right
to
remain
in
it
thus
the
progress
which
herder
sees
is
to
use
his
own
geometrical
illustration
a
sequence
of
unequal
and
broken
curves
corresponding
to
different
maxima
and
minima
each
curve
has
its
own

the
history
of

the
power

until

had
been
gained
and
this
would

the
rendering
of
weltburgerlich
approaches
the
problems
raised
by
the
history
of
civilisation
from
a
new
point
of
view
he
starts
with
the
principle
of
invariable
law
on
any
theory
of
free
will
he
says
human
actions
are
as
completely
under
the
control
of
of
nature
as
any
other
physical
phenomena
this
is
illustrated
by
statistics
registers
of
births
deaths
and
marriages
show
that
these
events
occur
with
as
much
conformity
to
laws
of
nature
as
the
oscillations
of
the
weather
it
is
the
same
with
the
great
sequence
of
historical
events
taken
alone
and
individually
they
seem
incoherent
and
lawless
but
viewed
in
their
connection
as
due
to
the
action
not
of
individuals
but
of
the
human
species
they
do
not
fail
to
reveal
a
regular
stream
of
tendency
pursuing
their
own
often
contradictory
purposes
individual
nations
and
individual
men
are
unconsciously
promoting
a
process
to
which
if
they
perceived
it
they
would
pay
little
regard
individual
men
do
not
obey
a
law
they
do
not
obey
the
laws
of
instinct
like
animals
nor
do
they
obey
as
rational
citizens
of
the
world
would
do
the
laws
of
a
preconcerted
plan
if
we
look
at
the
stage
of
history
we
see
scattered
and
occasional
indications
of
wisdom
but
the
general
sum
of
men
actions
is
a
web
of
folly
childish
vanity
and
often
even
of
the
idlest
wickedness
and
spirit
of
destruction
the
problem
for
the
philosopher
is
to
discover
a
meaning
in
this
senseless
current
of
human
actions
so
that
the
history
of
creatures
who
pursue
no
plan
of
their
own
may
yet
admit
of
a
systematic
form
the
clew
to
this
form
is
supplied
by
the
predispositions
of
human
nature
i
have
stated
this
problem
almost
in
kant
words
and
as
he
might
have
stated
it
if
he
had
not
introduced
the
conception
of
final
causes
his
use
of
the
postulate
of
final
causes
without
justifying
it
is
a
defect
in
his
essay
he
identifies
what
he
well
calls
a
stream
of
tendency
with
a
natural
purpose
he
makes
no
attempt
to
show
that
the
succession
of
events
is
such
that
it
can
not
be
explained
without
the
postulate
of
a
purpose
his
solution
of
the
problem
is
governed
by
this
conception
of
finality
and
by
the
unwarranted
assumption
that
nature
does
nothing
in
vain
he
lays
down
that
all
the
tendencies
to
which
any
creature
is
predisposed
by
its
nature
must
in
the
end
be
developed
perfectly
and
agreeably
to
their
final
purpose
those
predispositions
in
man
which
serve
the
use
of
his
reason
are
therefore
destined
to
be
fully
developed
this
destiny
however
can
not
be
realised
in
the
individual
it
can
only
be
realised
in
the
species
for
reason
works
tentatively
by
progress
and
regress
each
man
would
require
an
inordinate
length
of
time
to
make
a
perfect
use
of
his
natural
tendencies
therefore
as
life
is
short
an
incalculable
series
of
generations
is
needed
the
means
which
nature
employs
to
develop
these
tendencies
is
the
antagonism
which
in
man
social
state
exists
between
his
gregarious
and
his
antigregarious
tendencies
his
antigregarious
nature
expresses
itself
in
the
desire
to
force
all
things
to
comply
to
his
own
humour
hence
ambition
love
of
honour
avarice
these
were
necessary
to
raise
mankind
from
the
savage
to
the
civilised
state
but
for
these
antisocial
propensities
men
would
be
gentle
as
sheep
and
an
arcadian
life
would
arise
of
perfect
harmony
and
mutual
love
such
as
must
suffocate
and
stifle
all
talents
in
their
very
germs
nature
knowing
better
than
man
what
is
good
for
the
species
ordains
discord
she
is
to
be
thanked
for
competition
and
enmity
and
for
the
thirst
of
power
and
wealth
for
without
these
the
final
purpose
of
realising
man
rational
nature
would
remain
unfulfilled
this
is
kant
answer
to
rousseau
the
full
realisation
of
man
rational
nature
is
possible
only
in
a
universal
civil
society
founded
on
political
justice
the
establishment
of
such
a
society
is
the
highest
problem
for
the
human
species
kant
contemplates
as
the
political
goal
a
confederation
of
states
in
which
the
utmost
possible
freedom
shall
be
united
with
the
most
rigorous
determination
of
the
boundaries
of
freedom
is
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
a
universal
or
cosmopolitical
society
of
this
kind
will
come
into
being
and
if
so
how
will
it
be
brought
about
political
changes
in
the
relations
of
states
are
generally
produced
by
war
wars
are
tentative
endeavours
to
bring
about
new
relations
and
to
form
new
political
bodies
are
combinations
and
recombinations
to
continue
until
by
pure
chance
some
rational
system
emerges
or
is
it
possible
that
no
such
condition
of
society
may
ever
arrive
and
that
ultimately
all
progress
may
be
overwhelmed
by
a
hell
of
evils
or
finally
is
nature
pursuing
her
regular
course
of
raising
the
species
by
its
own
spontaneous
efforts
and
developing
in
the
apparently
wild
succession
of
events
originally
implanted
tendencies
kant
accepts
the
last
alternative
on
the
ground
that
it
is
not
reasonable
to
assume
a
final
purpose
in
particular
natural
processes
and
at
the
same
time
to
assume
that
there
is
no
final
purpose
in
the
whole
thus
his
theory
of
progress
depends
on
the
hypothesis
of
final
causes
it
follows
that
to
trace
the
history
of
mankind
is
equivalent
to
unravelling
a
hidden
plan
of
nature
for
accomplishing
a
perfect
civil
constitution
for
a
universal
society
since
a
universal
society
is
the
sole
state
in
which
the
tendencies
of
human
nature
can
be
fully
developed
we
can
not
determine
the
orbit
of
the
development
because
the
whole
period
is
so
vast
and
only
a
small
fraction
is
known
to
us
but
this
is
enough
to
show
that
there
is
a
definite
course
kant
thinks
that
such
a
cosmopolitical
history
as
he
calls
it
is
possible
and
that
if
it
were
written
it
would
give
us
a
clew
opening
up
a
consolatory
prospect
into
futurity
in
which
at
a
remote
distance
we
shall
discover
the
human
species
seated
upon
an
eminence
won
by
infinite
toil
where
all
the
germs
are
unfolded
which
nature
has
implanted
and
its
own
destination
upon
this
earth
accomplished
but
to
see
the
full
bearing
of
kant
discussion
we
must
understand
its
connection
with
his
ethics
for
his
ethical
theory
is
the
foundation
and
the
motive
of
his
speculation
on
progress
the
progress
on
which
he
lays
stress
is
moral
amelioration
he
refers
little
to
scientific
or
material
progress
for
him
morality
was
an
absolute
obligation
founded
in
the
nature
of
reason
such
an
obligation
presupposes
an
end
to
be
attained
and
this
end
is
a
reign
of
reason
under
which
all
men
obeying
the
moral
law
mutually
treat
each
other
as
ends
in
themselves
such
an
ideal
state
must
be
regarded
as
possible
because
it
is
a
necessary
postulate
of
reason
from
this
point
of
view
it
may
be
seen
that
kant
speculation
on
universal
history
is
really
a
discussion
whether
the
ideal
state
which
is
required
as
a
subjective
postulate
in
the
interest
of
ethics
is
likely
to
be
realised
objectively
now
kant
does
not
assert
that
because
our
moral
reason
must
assume
the
possibility
of
this
hypothetical
goal
civilisation
is
therefore
moving
towards
it
that
would
be
a
fallacy
into
which
he
was
incapable
of
falling
civilisation
is
a
phenomenon
and
anything
we
know
about
it
can
only
be
inferred
from
experience
his
argument
is
that
there
are
actual
indications
of
progress
in
this
desirable
direction
he
pointed
to
the
contemporary
growth
of
civil
liberty
and
religious
liberty
and
these
are
conditions
of
moral
improvement
so
far
his
argument
coincides
in
principle
with
that
of
french
theorists
of
progress
but
kant
goes
on
to
apply
to
these
data
the
debatable
conception
of
final
causes
and
to
infer
a
purpose
in
the
development
of
humanity
only
this
inference
is
put
forward
as
a
hypothesis
not
as
a
dogma
it
is
probable
that
what
hindered
kant
from
broaching
his
theory
of
progress
with
as
much
confidence
as
condorcet
was
his
perception
that
nothing
could
be
decisively
affirmed
about
the
course
of
civilisation
until
the
laws
of
its
movement
had
been
discovered
he
saw
that
this
was
a
matter
for
scientific
investigation
he
says
expressly
that
the
laws
are
not
yet
known
and
suggests
that
some
future
genius
may
do
for
social
phenomena
what
kepler
and
newton
did
for
the
heavenly
bodies
as
we
shall
see
this
is
precisely
what
some
of
the
leading
french
thinkers
of
the
next
generation
will
attempt
to
do
but
cautiously
though
he
framed
the
hypothesis
kant
evidently
considered
progress
probable
he
recognised
that
the
most
difficult
obstacle
to
the
moral
advance
of
man
lies
in
war
and
the
burdens
which
the
possibility
of
war
imposes
and
he
spent
much
thought
on
the
means
by
which
war
might
be
abolished
he
published
a
philosophical
essay
on
perpetual
peace
in
which
he
formulated
the
articles
of
an
international
treaty
to
secure
the
disappearance
of
war
he
considered
that
while
a
universal
republic
would
be
the
positive
ideal
we
shall
probably
have
to
be
contented
with
what
he
calls
a
negative
substitute
consisting
in
a
federation
of
peoples
bound
by
a
guaranteeing
the
independence
of
each
member
but
to
assure
the
permanence
of
this
system
it
is
essential
that
each
state
should
have
a
democratic
constitution
for
such
a
constitution
is
based
on
individual
liberty
and
civil
equality
all
these
changes
should
be
brought
about
by
legal
reforms
revolutions
he
was
writing
in
can
not
be
justified
we
see
the
influence
of
rousseau
social
contract
and
that
of
the
abbe
de
with
whose
works
kant
was
acquainted
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
it
was
the
influence
of
french
thought
so
powerful
in
germany
at
this
period
that
turned
kant
mind
towards
these
speculations
which
belong
to
the
latest
period
of
his
life
and
form
a
sort

system

kant
examined
all
these
conceptions
and
appropriated
them
to
the
service
of
his
own
highly
metaphysical
theory
of
ethics
in
this
new
association
their
spirit
was
changed
in
france
as
we
saw
the
theory
of
progress
was
generally
associated
with
ethical
views
which
could
find
a
metaphysical
basis
in
the
sensationalism
of
locke
a
moral
system
which
might
be
built
on
sensation
as
the
primary
mental
fact
was
worked
out
by
helvetius
but
the
principle
that
the
supreme
law
of
conduct
is
to
obey
nature
had
come
down
as
a
practical
philosophy
from
rabelais
and
montaigne
through
moliere
to
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
reinforced
by
the
theory
of
the
natural
goodness
of
man
jansenism
had
struggled
against
it
and
was
defeated
after
theology
it
was
the
turn
of
metaphysics
kant
moral
imperative
marked
the
next
stage
in
the
conflict
of
the
two
opposite
tendencies
which
seek
natural
and
sanctions
for
morality
hence
the
idea
of
progress
had
a
different
significance
for
kant
and
for
its
french
exponents
though
his
particular
view
of
the
future
possibly
in
store
for
the
human
species
coincided
in
some
essential
points
with
theirs
but
his
theory
of
life
gives
a
different
atmosphere
to
the
idea
in
france
the
atmosphere
is
emphatically
eudaemonic
happiness
is
the
goal
kant
is
an
uncompromising
opponent
of
eudaemonism
if
we
take
enjoyment
or
happiness
as
the
measure
it
is
easy
he
says
to
evaluate
life
its
value
is
less
than
nothing
for
who
would
begin
life
again
in
the
same
conditions
or
even
in
new
natural
conditions
if
one
could
choose
them
oneself
but
of
which
enjoyment
would
be
the
sole
end
there
was
in
fact
a
vein
of
pessimism
in
kant
one
of
the
ablest
men
of
the
younger
generation
who
were
brought
up
on
his
system
founded
the
philosophical
pessimism
very

in

and
depth
from
the
sentimental
pessimism
of

was

with

they
rejected
its

progressive
development
was
directly
deduced
from
their

if
their

history
have
no

value
it
is
significant
that
in
their
ambitious
attempts
to
explain
the
universe
a
priori
history
was
conceived
as
progressive
and
their
philosophies
did
much
to
reinforce
a
conception
which
on
very
different
principles
was
making
its
way
in
the
world
but
the
progress
which
their
systems
involved
was
not
bound
up
with
the
interest
of
human
happiness
but
stood
out
as
a
fact
which
whether
agreeable
or
not
is
a
consequence
of
the
nature
of
thought
the
process
of
the
universe
as
it
appeared
to
fichte

to
a
full
realisation
of

is
its
end
and
goal
but
a
goal
that
always
recedes
it
can
never
be
reached
for
its
full
attainment
would
mean
the
complete
suppression
of
nature
the
process
of
the
world
therefore
consists
in
an
indefinite
approximation
to
an
unattainable
ideal
freedom
is
being
perpetually
realised
more
and
more
and
the
world
as
it
ascends
in
this
direction
becomes
more
and
more
a
realm
of
reason
what
fichte
means
by
freedom
may
be
best
explained
by
its
opposition
to
instinct
a
man
acting
instinctively
may
be
acting
quite
reasonably
in
a
way
which
any
one
fully
conscious
of
all
the
implications
and
consequences
of
the
action
would
judge
to
be
reasonable
but
in
order
that
his
actions
should
be
free
he
must
himself
be
fully
conscious
of
all
those
implications
and
consequences
it
follows
that
the
end
of
mankind
upon
earth
is
to
reach
a
state
in
which
all
the
relations
of
life
shall
be
ordered
according
to
reason
not
instinctively
but
with
full
consciousness
and
deliberate
purpose
this
end
should
govern
the
ethical
rules
of
conduct
and
it
determines
the
necessary
stages
of
history
it
gives
us
at
once
two
main
periods
the
earliest
and
the
latest
the
earliest
in
which
men
act
reasonably
by
instinct
and
the
latest
in
which
they
are
conscious
of
reason
and
try
to
realise
it
fully
but
before
reaching
this
final
stage
they
must
pass
through
an
epoch
in
which
reason
is
conscious
of
itself
but
not
regnant
and
to
reach
this
they
must
have
emancipated
themselves
from
instinct
and
this
process
of
emancipation
means
a
fourth
epoch
but
they
could
not
have
wanted
to
emancipate
themselves
unless
they
had
felt
instinct
as
a
servitude
imposed
by
an
external
authority
and
therefore
we
have
to
distinguish
yet
another
epoch
wherein
reason
is
expressed
in
authoritarian
institutions
to
which
men
blindly
submit
in
this
way
fichte
deduces
five
historical
epochs
two
in
which
progress
is
blind
two
in
which
it
is
free
and
an
intermediate
in
which
it
is
struggling
to
consciousness

some
of
the
characteristics

in

there

three
years
later
however
fichte
maintained
in
his
patriotic
discourses
to
the
german
nation
that
in
man
had
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
fourth
epoch
he
asserted
that
the
progress
of
culture
and
science
will
depend
henceforward
chiefly
on
germany
fichte
has
deduced
this
scheme
purely
a
priori
without
any
reference
to
actual
experience
the
philosopher
he
says
follows
the
a
priori
thread
of
the
which
is
clear
to
him
without
any
history
and
if
he
makes
use
of
history
it
is
not
to
prove
anything
since
his
theses
are
already
proved
independently
of
all
history
historical
development
is
thus
presented
as
a
necessary
progress
towards
a
goal
which
is
known
but
can
not
be
reached
and
this
fact
as
to
the
destiny
of
the
race
constitutes
the
basis
of
morality
of
which
the
fundamental
law
is
to
act
in
such
a
way
as
to
promote
the
free
realisation
of
reason
upon
earth
it
has
been
claimed
by
a
recent
critic
that
fichte
was
the
first
modern
philosopher
to
humanise
morals
he
completely
rejected
the
individualistic
conception
which
underlay
kantian
as
well
as
christian
ethics
he
asserted
that
the
true
motive
of
morality
is
not
the
salvation
of
the
individual
man
but
the
progress
of
humanity
in
fact
with
fichte
progress
is
the
principle
of
ethics
that
the
christian
ideal
of
ascetic
saintliness
detached
from
society
has
no
moral
value
is
a
plain
corollary
from
the
idea

condescended

in
some
detail
the

conceived
the

as

of

ambiguous

virtually
equivalent

as
the
description
of
the
process
by
which

comes
to
the
consciousness

this

not

recognising

here
is
the
most
striking
difference
between
the
theories
of
fichte
and
hegel
both
saw
the
goal
of
human
development
in
the
realisation
of
freedom
but
while
with
fichte
the
development
never
ends
as
the
goal
is
unattainable
with
hegel
the
development
is
already
complete
the
goal
is
not
only
attainable
but
has
now
been
attained
thus
hegel
is
what
we
may
call
a
closed
system

has
been
progressive

no
path
is
left

conclusion

the
result
is
singularly
inadequate

his

eminently
inhuman
the
happiness

is
a
matter
of
supreme
indifference
to
the

realise
itself
in

ruthlessly
sacrifices

all
cast

other
great
representative
of

who
took
his
departure
from
kant
also
saw
in
history
a
progressive
revelation
of
divine
reason
but
it
was
the
processes
of
nature
not
the
career
of
humanity
that
absorbed
the
best
energies
of
schelling
and
the
elaboration
of
a
philosophical
idea
of
organic
evolution
was
the
prominent
feature
of
his
speculation
his
influence
and
it
was
wide
reaching
even
scientific
biologists
lay
chiefly
in
diffusing
this
idea
and
he
thus
contributed
to
the
formation
of
a
theory

afterwards
to
place
the
idea
of

on
a
more
imposing
base
footnote
schelling
views
notoriously
varied
at
various
stages
of
his
career
in
his
system
of
transcendental
idealism
he
distinguished
three
historical
periods
in
the
first
of
which
the
absolute
reveals
itself
as
fate
in
the
second
as
nature
in
the
third
as
providence
and
asserted
that
we
are
still
living
in
the
second
which
began
with
the
expansion
of
rome
werke
i
in
this
context
he
says
that
the
conception
of
an
infinite
progressivity
is
included
in
the
conception
of
history
but
adds
that
the
perfectibility
of
the
race
can
not
be
directly
inferred
for
it
may
be
said
that
man
has
no
proper
history
but
turns
round
on
a
wheel
of
ixion
the
difficulty
of
establishing
the
fact
of
progress
from
the
course
of
events
lies
in
discovering
a
criterion
schelling
rejects
the
criterion
of
moral
improvement
and
that
of
advance
in
science
and
arts
as
unpractical
or
misleading
but
if
we
see
the
sole
object
of
history
in
a
gradual
realisation
of
the
ideal
state
we
have
a
measure
of
progress
which
can
be
applied
though
it
can
not
be
proved
either
by
theory
or
by
experience
that
the
goal
will
be
attained
this
must
remain
an
article
of
faith
ib
schelling
influenced
among
others
his
contemporary
krause
a
less
familiar
name
who
worked
out
a
philosophy
of
history
in
which
this
idea
is
fundamental
krause
conceived
history
which
is
the
expression
of
the
absolute
as
the
development
of
life
society
as
an
organism
and
social
growth
as
a
process
which
can
be
deduced
from
abstract
biological
principles

and
maturity
the
second
of
these
falls
into
three
periods
characterised
by
polytheism
monotheism
middle
ages
scepticism

the

all
these
transcendent

had
this
in
common
that
they
pretended
to
discover
the
necessary
course

human
history
on
metaphysical
principles
independent
of
experience
but
it
has
been
rightly
doubted
whether
this
alleged
independence
was
genuine
we
may
question
whether
any
of
them
would
have
produced
the

sequence
of
periods
of
history
if
the
actual
facts
of
history
had
been
to
them
a
sealed
book
indeed
we
may
be
sure
that
they
were
surreptitiously
and
subconsciously
using
experience
as
a
guide
while
they
imagined
that
abstract
principles
were
entirely
responsible
for
their
conclusions

this
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
their
ideas

narrow
circle
of

even
the

they
did
much
to
establish
the
notion
of
progressive
development
as
a
category
of
thought
almost
as
familiar

indispensable
as
that

they
helped
to
diffuse
the
idea
of
an
increasing
purpose
in
history
augustine
or
bossuet
might
indeed
have
spoken
of
an
increasing
purpose
but
the
purpose
of
their
speculations
was
subsidiary
to
a
future
life
the
purpose
of
the
german
idealists
could
be
fulfilled
in
earthly
conditions
and
required
no
theory
of
personal
immortality
this
atmosphere
of
thought
affected
even
intelligent
reactionaries
who
wrote
in
the
interest
of
orthodox
christianity

the

did
not

left
him
cool
and

towards

the

was
a

part
of

extended
far
beyond
the
circle
of
ardent
catholics
it
was
a
characteristic
feature
as
every
one
knows
of
the
romantic

it
did
not
affect
only
creative

it
occupied

the
middle
ages
have
a
significance
which
frenchmen
of
the
previous
generation
could
hardly
have
comprehended
we
saw
how
that
period
had
embarrassed
the
first
pioneers
who
attempted
to
trace
the
course
of
civilisation
as
a
progressive
movement
how
lightly
they
passed
over
it
how
unconvincingly
they
explained
it
away
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
medieval
question
was
posed
in
such
a
way
that
any
one
who
undertook
to
develop
the
doctrine
of
progress
would
have
to
explore
it
more
seriously
madame
de
stael
saw
this
when
she
wrote
her
book
on
literature
considered
in
its
relation
to
social
institutions
she
was
then
under
the
influence
of
condorcet
and
an
ardent
believer
in
perfectibility
and
the
work
is
an
attempt
to
extend
this
theory
which
she
testifies
was
falling
into
discredit
to
the
realm
of
literature
she
saw
that
if
man
regressed
instead
of
progressing
for
ten
centuries
the
case
for
progress
was
gravely
compromised
and
she
sought
to
show
that
the
middle
ages
contributed
to
the
development
of
the
intellectual
faculties
and
to
the
expansion
of
civilisation
and
that
the
christian
religion
was
an
indispensable
agent
this
contention
that
progress
was
uninterrupted
is
an
advance
on
condorcet
and
an
anticipation
of
and
comte
a
more
eloquent
and
persuasive
voice
was
raised
in
the
following
year
from
the
ranks
of
reaction
chateaubriand
genie
du
christianisme
appeared
in
amidst
the
ruins
of
our
temples
as
the
author
afterwards
said
when
france
was
issuing
from
the
chaos
of
her
revolution
it
was
a
declaration
of
war
against
the
spirit
of
the
eighteenth
century
which
had
treated
christianity
as
a
barbarous
system
whose
fall
was
demanded
in
the
name
of
progress
but
it
was
much
more
than
polemic
chateaubriand
arrayed
arguments
in
support
of
orthodox
dogmas
original
sin
primitive
degeneration
and
the
rest
but
the
appeal
of
the
book
did
not
lie
in
its
logic
it
lay
in
the
appreciation
of
christianity
from
a
new
point
of
view
he
approached
it
in
the
spirit
of
an
artist
as
an
aesthete
not
as
a
philosopher
and
so
far
as
he
proved
anything
he
proved
that
christianity
is
valuable
because
it
is
beautiful
not
because
it
is
true
he
aimed
at
showing
that
it
can
enchanter
aussi
divinement
que
les
dieux
de
virgile
et
he
might
call
to
his
help
the
fathers
of
the
church
but
it
was
on
dante
milton
racine
that
his
case
was
really
based
the
book
is
an
apologia
from
the
aesthetic
standpoint
of
the
romantic
school
dieu

defend

les

fleuries
quand

it
was
a
matter
of
course
that
the
defender
of
original
sin
should
reject
the
doctrine
of
perfectibility
when
man
attains
the
highest
point
of
civilisation
wrote
chateaubriand
in
the
vein
of
rousseau
he
is
on
the
lowest
stair

morality

he
is

is

his

interest
for
the

school
victor

in
the
famous
preface
to
his
cromwell
where
he
went
more
deeply
than
chateaubriand
into
the
contrasts
between
ancient
and
modern
art
revived
the
old
likeness
of
mankind
to
an
individual
man
and
declared
that
classical
antiquity
was
the
time
of
its
virility
and
that
we
are
now
spectators
of
its
imposing
old
age
from
other
points
of
view
powerful
intellects
were
reverting
to
the
middle
ages
and
eager
to
blot
out
the
whole
development
of
modern
society
since
the
reformation
as
the
encyclopaedic
philosophers
had
wished
to
blot
out
the
middle
ages
the
ideal
of
bonald
de
maistre
and
lamennais
was
a
sacerdotal
government
of
the
world
and
the
english
constitution
was
hardly
less
offensive
to
their
minds
than
the
revolution
which
de
maistre
denounced
as
satanic
advocates
as
they
were
of
the
dead
system
of
theocracy
they
contributed
however
to
the
advance
of
thought
not
only
by
forcing
medieval
institutions
on
the
notice
of
the
world
but
also
by
their
perception
that
society
had
been
treated
in
the
eighteenth
century
in
too
mechanical
a
way
that
institutions
grow
that
the
conception
of
individual
men
divested
of
their
life
in
society
is
a
misleading
abstraction
they
put
this
in
extravagant
and
untenable
forms
but
there
was
a
large
measure
of
truth
in
their
criticism
which
did
its
part
in
helping
the
nineteenth
century
to
revise
and
transcend
the
results
of
eighteenth
century
speculation
in
this
reactionary
literature
we
can
see
the
struggle
of
the
doctrine
of
providence
declining
before
the
doctrine
of
progress
to
gain
the
again
chateaubriand
bonald
de

held
the
dogma
of
an
original
golden
age
and
the
degradation
of
man
and
denounced
the
whole
trend
of
progressive
thought
from

did
not
mention
him

he

anachronism

appealed
to
the

he
did
not
announce

conceive
any
theory

his

bewildering
enough
and
confused
in

contained
principles

seemed
predestined
to
form

was

a
writer
who
enjoyed
a
considerable
repute
in

he
taught
the
progressive
development
of
man
towards
liberty
and
equality
within
the
four
corners
of
the
christian
religion
which
he
regarded
as
final
his
palingenesie

appeared
in
his
fundamental
idea
was
that
the
explanation
of
the
history
of
societies
is
to
be
found
in
the
human
mind
the
world
at
first
is
felt
rather
than
thought
this
is
the
condition
of
savages
in
the
state
of
nature
who
have
no
political
organisation
the
second
mental
state
is
imaginative
knowledge
poetical
wisdom
to
this
corresponds
the
higher
barbarism
of
the
heroic
age
finally
comes
conceptual
knowledge
and
with
it
the
age
of
civilisation
these
are
the
three
stages
through
which
every
society
passes
and
each
of
these
types
determines
law
institutions
language
literature
and
the
characters
of
men
vico
strenuous
researches
in
the
study
of
homer
and
early
roman
history
were
undertaken
in
order
to
get
at
the
point
of
view
of
the
heroic
age
he
insisted
that
it
could
not
be
understood
unless
we
transcended
our
own
abstract
ways
of
thinking
and
looked
at
the
world
with
primitive
eyes
by
a
forced
effort
of
imagination
he
was
convinced
that
history
had
been
vitiated
by
the
habit
of
ignoring
psychological
differences
by
the
failure
to
recapture
the
ancient
point
of
view
here
he
was
far
in
advance
of
his
own
times
concentrating
his
attention
above
all
on
roman
antiquity
he
adopted
not
altogether
advantageously
for
his
system
the
revolutions
of
roman
history
as
the
typical
rule
of
social
development
the
succession
of
aristocracy
for
the
early
kingship
of
rome
and
homeric
royalty
are
merely
forms
of
aristocracy
in
vico
view
democracy
and
monarchy
is
the
necessary
sequence
of
political
governments
monarchy
the
roman
empire
corresponds
to
the
highest
form
of
civilisation
what
happens
when
this
is
reached
society
declines
into
an
anarchical
state
of
nature
from
which
it
again
passes
into
a
higher
barbarism
or
heroic
age
to
be
followed
once
more
by
civilisation
the
dissolution
of
the
roman
empire
and
the
barbarian
invasions
are
followed
by
the
middle
ages
in
which
dante
plays
the
part
of
homer
and
the
modern
period
with
its
strong
monarchies
corresponds
to
the
roman
empire
this
is
principle
of
reflux
if
the
theory
were
sound
it
would
mean
that
the
civilisation
of
his
day
must
again
relapse
into
barbarism
and
the
cycle
begin
again
he
did
not
himself
state
this
conclusion
directly
or
venture
on
any
prediction
it
is
obvious
how
readily
his
doctrine
could
be
adapted
to
the
conception
of
progress
as
a
spiral
movement
evidently
the
corresponding
periods
in
his
cycles
are
not
identical
or
really
homogeneous
whatever
points
of
likeness
may
be
discovered
between
early
greek
or
roman
and
medieval
societies
the
points
of
unlikeness
are
still
more
numerous
and
manifest
modern
civilisation
differs
in
fundamental
and
ways
from
greek
and
roman
it
is
absurd
to
pretend
that
the
general
movement
brings
man
back
again
and
again
to
the
point
from
which
he
started
and
therefore
if
there
is
any
value
in
vico
reflux
it
can
only
mean
that
the
movement
of
society
may
be
regarded
as
a
spiral
ascent
so
that
each
stage
of
an
upward
progress
corresponds
in
certain
general
aspects
to
a
stage
which
has
already
been
traversed
this
correspondence
being
due
to
the
psychical
nature
of
man
a
conception
of
this
kind
could
not
be
appreciated
in
vico
day
or
by
the
next
generation
the
scienza
nuova
lay
in
montesquieu
library
and
he
made
no
use
of
it
but
it
was
natural
that
it
should
arouse
interest
in
france
at
a
time
when
the
new
idealistic
philosophies
of
germany
were
attracting
attention
and
when
frenchmen
of
the
ideological
school
were
seeking
like
vico
himself
a
synthetic
principle
to
explain
social
phenomena
different
though
vico
was
in
his
point
of
departure
as
in
his
methods
from
the
german
idealists
his
speculations
nevertheless
had
something
in
common
with
theirs
both
alike
explained
history
by
the
nature
of
mind
which
necessarily
determined
the
stages
of
the
process
vico
as
little
as
fichte
or
hegel
took
eudaemonic
considerations
into
account
the
difference
was
that
the
german
thinkers
sought
their
principle
in
logic
and
applied
it
a
priori
while
vico
sought
his
in
concrete
psychology
and
engaged
in
laborious
research
to
establish
it
a
posteriori
by
the
actual
data
of
history
but
both
speculations
suggested
that
the
course
of
human
development
corresponds
to
the
fundamental
character
of
mental
processes
and
is
not
diverted
either
by
providential
intervention
or
by
free
acts
of
human
will
these
foreign
influences
in
determining
the
tendencies
of
french
speculation
in
the
period
of
the
restored
monarchy
whereby
the
idea
of
progress
was
placed
on
new
basements
and
became
the
headstone
of
new
religions
before
we
consider
the
founders
of
sects
we
may
glance
briefly
at
the
views
of
some
eminent
savants
who
had
gained
the
ear
of
the
public
before
the
july
revolution
jouffroy
cousin
and
guizot
cousin
the
chief
luminary
in
the
sphere
of
pure
philosophy
in
france
in
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
drew
his
inspiration
from
germany
he
was
professedly
an
eclectic
but
in
the
main
his
philosophy
was
hegelian
he
might
endow
god
with
consciousness
and
speak
of
providence
but
he
regarded
the
as
a
necessary
evolution
of
thought
and
he
saw
not
in
religion
but
in
philosophy
the
highest
expression
of
civilisation
in
he
delivered
a
course
of
lectures
on
the
philosophy
of
history
he
divided
history
into
three
periods
each
governed
by
a
master
idea
the
first
by
the
idea
of
the
infinite
the
orient
the
second
by
that
of
the
finite
classical
antiquity
the
third
by
that
of
the
relation
of
finite
to
infinite
the
modern
age
as
with
hegel
the
future
is
ignored
progress
is
confined
within
a
closed
system
the
highest
circle
has
already
been
reached
as
an
opponent
of
the
ideologists
and
the
sensational
philosophy
on
which
they
founded
their
speculations
cousin
appealed
to
the
orthodox
and
all
those
to
whom
voltairianism
was
an
accursed
thing
and
for
a
generation
he
exercised
a
considerable
influence
but
his
work
and
this
is
the
important
point
for
us
helped
to
diffuse
the
idea
which
the
ideologists
were
diffusing
on
very
different
lines
that
human
history
has
been
a
progressive
development
progressive
development
was
also
the
theme
of
jouffroy
in
his
slight
but
suggestive
introduction
to
the
philosophy
of
history
footnote
reflexions
sur
la
philosophie
de
in
melanges
philosophiques
edition
in
which
he
posed
the
same
problem
which
as
we
shall
see
and
comte
were
simultaneously
attempting
to
solve
he
had
not
fallen
under
the
glamour
of
german
idealism
and
his
results
have
more
affinity
with
vico
than
with
hegel
he
begins
with
some
simple
considerations
which
conduct
to
the
doubtful
conclusion
that
all
the
historical
changes
in
man
condition
are
due
to
the
operation
of
his
intelligence
the
historian
business
is
to
trace
the
succession
of
the
actual
changes
the
business
of
the
philosopher
of
history
is
to
trace
the
succession
of
ideas
and
study
the
correspondence
between
the
two
developments
this
is
the
true
philosophy
of
history
the
glory
of
our
age
is
to
understand
it
now
it
is
admitted
he
says
that
the
human
intelligence
obeys
invariable
laws
so
that
a
further
problem
remains
the
actual
succession
of
ideas
has
to
be
deduced
from
these
necessary
laws
when
that
deduction
is
effected
a
long
time
hence
history
will
disappear
it
will
be
merged
in
science
jouffroy
then
presented
the
world
with
what
he
calls
the
fatality
of
intellectual
development
to
take
the
place
of
providence
or
destiny
it
is
a
fatality
he
is
careful
to
explain
which
so
far
from
compromising
presupposes
individual
liberty
for
it
is
not
like
the
fatality
of
sensual
impulse
which
guides
the
brute
creation
what
it
implies
is
this
if
a
thousand
men
have
the
same
idea
of
what
is
good
this
idea
will
govern
their
conduct
in
spite
of
their
passions
because
being
reasonable
and
free
they
are
not
blindly
submissive
to
passion
but
can
deliberate
and
choose
this
explanation
of
history
as
a
necessary
development
of
society
corresponding
to
a
necessary
succession
of
ideas
differs
in
two
important
points
from
the
explanations
of
hegel
and
cousin
the
succession
of
ideas
is
not
conceived
as
a
transcendent
logic
but
is
determined
by
the
laws
of
the
human
mind
and
belongs
to
the
domain
of
psychology
here
jouffroy
is
on
the
same
ground
as
vico
in
the
second
place
it
is
not
a
closed
system
room
remains
for
an
indefinite
development
in
the
future
while
cousin
was
discoursing
on
philosophy
at
paris
in
the
days
of
the
last
bourbon
king
guizot
was
drawing
crowded
audiences
to
his
lectures
on
the
history
of
european
civilisation
footnote
histoire
de
la
civilisation
en
europe
and
the
keynote
of
these
lectures
was
progress
he
approached
it
with
a
fresh
mind
unencumbered
with
any
of
the
philosophical
theories
which
had
attended
and
helped
its
growth
civilisation
he
said
is
the
supreme
fact
so
far
as
man
is
concerned
the
fact
par
excellence
the
general
and
definite
fact
in
which
all
other
facts
merge
and
civilisation
means
progress
or
development
the
word
awakens
when
it
is
pronounced
the
idea
of
a
people
which
is
in
motion
not
to
change
its
place
but
to
change
its
state
a
people
whose
condition
is
expanding
and
improving
the
idea
of
progress
development
seems
to
me
to
be
the
fundamental
idea
contained
in
the
word
civilisation
there
we
have
the
most
important
positive
idea
of
eighteenth
century
speculation
standing
forth
detached
and
independent
no
longer
bound
to
a
system
fifty
years
before
no
one
would
have
dreamed
of
defining
civilisation
like
that
and
counting
on
the
immediate
acquiescence
of
his
audience
but
progress
has
to
be
defined
it
does
not
merely
imply
the
improvement
of
social
relations
and
public
france
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
was
behind
holland
and
england
in
the
sum
and
distribution
of
among
individuals
and
yet
she
can
claim
that
she
was
the
most
civilised
country
in
those
ages
the
reason
is
that
civilisation
also
implies
the
development
of
the
individual
life
of
men
private
faculties
sentiments
and
ideas
the
progress
of
man
therefore
includes
both
these
developments
but
they
are
intimately
connected
we
may
observe
how
moral
reformers
generally
recommend
their
proposals
by
promising
social
amelioration
as
a
result
and
that
progressive
politicians
maintain
that
the
progress
of
society
necessarily
induces
moral
improvement
the
connection
may
not
always
be
apparent
and
at
different
times
one
or
other
kind
of
progress
predominates
but
one
is
followed
by
the
other
ultimately
though
it
may
be
after
a
long
interval
for
la
providence
a
ses
aises
dans
le
temps
the
rise
of
christianity
was
one
of
the
crises
of
civilisation
yet
it
did
not
in
its
early
stages
aim
at
any
improvement
of
social
conditions
it
did
not
attack
the
great
injustices
which
were
wrought
in
the
world
it
meant
a
great
crisis
because
it
changed
the
beliefs
and
sentiments
of
individuals
social
effects
came
afterwards
the
civilisation
of
modern
europe
has
grown
through
a
period
of
fifteen
centuries
and
is
still
progressing
the
rate
of
progress
has
been
slower
than
that
of
greek
civilisation
but
on
the
other
hand
it
has
been
continuous
uninterrupted
and
we
can
see
the
vista
of
an
immense
career
the
effects
of
guizot
doctrine
in
propagating
the
idea
of
progress
were
all
the
greater
for
its
divorce
from
philosophical
theory
he
did
not
touch
perplexing
questions
like
fatality
or
discuss
the
general
plan
of
the
world
he
did
not
attempt
to
rise
above
and
he
did
not
essay
any
premature
scheme
of
the
universal
history
of
man
his
masterly
survey
of
the
social
history
of
europe
exhibited
progressive
movement
as
a
fact
in
a
period
in
which
to
the
thinkers
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
had
been
almost
invisible
this
of
course
was
far
from
proving
that
progress
is
the
key
to
the
history
of
the
world
and
human
destinies
the
equation
of
civilisation
with
progress
remains
an
assumption
for
the
question
at
once
arises
can
civilisation
reach
a
state
of
equilibrium
from
which
no
further
advance
is
possible
and
if
it
can
does
it
cease
to
be
civilisation
is
chinese
civilisation
or
has
there
been
here
too
a
progressive
movement
all
the
time
however
slow
such
questions
were
not
raised
by
guizot
but
his
view
of
history
was
effective
in
helping
to
establish
the
association
of
the
two
ideas
of
civilisation
and
progress
which
is
taken
for
granted
as
evidently
true
the
views
of
these
eminent
thinkers
cousin
jouffroy
and
guizot
show
that
quite
apart
from
the
doctrines
of
ideologists
and
of
the
positivists
and
comte
of
whom
i
have
still
to
speak
there
was
a
common
trend
in
french
thought
in
the
restoration
period
towards
the
conception
of
history
as
a
progressive
movement
perhaps
there
is
no
better
illustration
of
the
infectiousness
of
this
conception
than
in
the
historical
studies
which
chateaubriand
gave
to
the
world
in
he
had
learned
much
from
books
as
well
as
from
politics
since
he
wrote
the
genius
of
christianity
he
had
gained
some
acquaintance
with
german
philosophy
and
with
vico
and
in
this
work
of
his
advanced
age
he
accepts
the
idea
of
progress
so
far
as
it
could
be
accepted
by
an
orthodox
son
of
the
church
he
believes
that
the
advance
of
knowledge
will
lead
to
social
progress
and
that
society
if
it
seems
sometimes
to
move
backward
is
always
really
moving
forward
bossuet
for
whom
he
had
no
word
of
criticism
thirty
years
before
he
now
convicts
of
an
imposing
error
that
great
man
he
writes
has
confined
historical
events
in
a
circle
as
rigorous
as
his
genius
he
has
imprisoned
them
in
an
inflexible
christianity
a
terrible
hoop
in
which
the
human
race
would
turn
in
a
sort
of
eternity
without
progress
or
improvement
the
admission
from
such
a
quarter
shows
eloquently
how
the
wind
was
setting
the
notions
of
development
and
continuity
which
were
to
control
all
departments
of
historical
study
in
the
later
nineteenth
century
were
at
the
same
time
being
independently
promoted
by
the
young
historical
school
in
germany
which
is
associated
with
the
names
of
eichhorn
savigny
and
niebuhr
their
view
that
laws
and
institutions
are
a
natural
growth
or
the
expression
of
a
people
mind
represents
another
departure
from
the
ideas
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
a
repudiation
of
that
universal
reason
which
desired
to
reform
the
world
and
its
peoples
indiscriminately
without
taking
any
account

last
chapter
the
idea
of
progress
passed
into
a
new
phase
of
its
growth
hitherto
it
had
been
a
vague
optimistic
doctrine
which
encouraged
the
idealism
of
reformers
and
revolutionaries
but
could
not
guide
them
it
had
waited
like
a
handmaid
on
the
abstractions
of
nature
and
reason
it
had
hardly
realised
an
independent
life
the
time
had
come
for
systematic
attempts
to
probe
its
meaning
and
definitely
to
ascertain
the
direction
in
which
humanity
is
moving
kant
had
said
that
a
kepler
or
a
newton
was
needed
to
find
the
law
of
the
movement
of
civilisation
several
frenchmen
now
undertook
to
solve
the
problem
they
did
not
solve
it
but
the
new
science
of
sociology
was
founded
and
the
idea
of
progress
which
presided
at
its
birth
has
been
its
principal
problem
ever
since
the
three
thinkers
who
claimed
to
have
discovered
the
secret
of
social
development
had
also
in
view
the
practical
object
of
remoulding
society
on
general
scientific
principles
and
they
became
the
founders
of
sects
fourier
and
comte
they
all
announced
a
new
era
of
development
as
a
necessary
sequel
of
the
past
an
inevitable
and
desirable
stage
in
the
march
of
humanity
and
delineated
its
features
comte
was
the
successor
of
as
himself
was
the
successor
of
condorcet
fourier
stands
quite
apart
he
claimed
that
he
broke
entirely
new
ground
and
acknowledged
no
masters
he
regarded
himself
as
a
newton
for
whom
no
kepler
or
galileo
had
prepared
the
way
the
most
important
and
sanest
part
of
his
work
was
the
scheme
for
organising
society
on
a
new
principle
of
industrial
his
general
theory
of
the
universe
and
man
destinies
which
lay
behind
his
practical
plans
is
so
fantastic
that
it
sounds
like
the
dream
of
a
lunatic
yet
many
accepted
it
as
the
apocalypse
of
an
evangelist
fourier
was
moved
by
the
effects
of
newton
discovery
to
seek
a
law
which
would
coordinate
facts
in
the
moral
world
as
the
principle
of
gravitation
had
facts
in
the
physical
world
and
in
he
claimed
to
have
found
the
secret
in
what
he
called
the
law
of
passional
attraction

the
human
passions
have
hitherto
been
sources
of
misery
the
problem
for
man
is
to
make
them
sources
of
happiness
if
we
know
the
law
which
governs
them
we
can
make
such
changes
in
our
environment
that
none
of
the
passions
will
need
to
be
curbed
and
the
free
indulgence
of
one
will
not
hinder
or
compromise
the
satisfaction
of
the
others
his
worthless
law
for
harmonising
the
passions
without
restraining
them
need
not
detain
us
the
structure
of
society
by
which
he
proposed
to
realise
the
benefits
of
his
discovery
was
based
on
but
was
not
socialistic
the
family
as
a
social
unit
was
to
be
replaced
by
a
larger
unit
phalange
economically
and
consisting
of
about
persons
who
were
to
live
together
in
a
vast
building
phalanstere
surrounded
by
a
domain
sufficient
to
produce
all
they
required
private
property

the

both

according
to
the
labour
talents
and
capital
of
each

but
a
fixed
minimum
is
assured
to
every
one
the
scheme
was
actually
tried
on
a
small
scale

this
transformation
of
society
which
is
to

of

he
will
now
enter
upon
a
long
period
of

harmony
which
will
be
followed
by
an
equal
period
of
decline
like
the
way
up
and
the
way
down
of
heraclitus
his
brief
past
the
age
of
his
infancy
has
been
marked
by
a
decline
of
happiness
leading
to
the
present
age
of
civilisation
which
is
thoroughly
bad
here
we
see
the
influence
of
rousseau
and
from
it
fourier
discovery
is
the
clue
to
lead
humanity
forth
into
the
epoch
in
which
harmony
begins
to
emerge
but
men
who
have
lived
in
the
bad
ages
need
not
be
pitied
and
those
who
live
need
not
be
pessimistic

fourier

in

sympathised
with
the
spirit
of

in

in
he
passed
through
several
phases
of
thought
footnote
they
are
traced
in

valuable
monograph

but
his
chief
masters
were
always
condorcet
and
the
physiologists
from
whom
he
derived
his
two
guiding
ideas
that
ethics
and
politics
depend
ultimately
on
physics
and
that
history
is
progress
condorcet
had
interpreted
history
by
the
progressive
movement
of
knowledge
that
said
is
the
true
principle
but
condorcet
applied
it
narrowly
and
committed
two
errors
he
did
not
understand
the
social
import
of
religion
and
he
represented
the
middle
ages
as
a
useless
interruption
of
the
forward
movement
here
learned
from
the
religious
reaction
he
saw
that
religion
has
a
natural
and
legitimate
social
role
and
can
not
be
eliminated
as
a
mere
perversity
he
expounded
the
doctrine
that
all
social
phenomena
cohere
a
religious
system
he
said
always
corresponds
to
the
stage
of
science
which
the
society
wherein
it
appears
has
reached
in
fact
religion
is
merely
science
clothed
in
a
form
suitable
to
the
emotional
needs
which
it
satisfies
and
as
a
religious
system
is
based
on
the
contemporary
phase
of
scientific
development
so
the
political
system
of
an
epoch
corresponds
to
the
religious
system
they
all
hang
together
medieval
europe
does
not
represent
a
temporary
triumph
of
obscurantism
useless
and
deplorable
but
a
valuable
and
necessary
stage
in
human
progress
it
was
a
period
in
which
an
important
principle
of
social
organisation
was
realised
the
right
relation
of
the
spiritual
and
temporal
powers
it
is
evident
that
these
views
transformed
the
theory
of
condorcet
into
a
more
acceptable
shape
so
long
as
the
medieval
tract
of
time
appeared
to
be
an
awkward
episode
contributing
nothing
to
the
forward
movement
but
rather
thwarting
and
retarding
it
progress
was
exposed
to
the
criticism
that
it
was
an
arbitrary
synthesis
only
partly
borne
out
by
historical
facts
and
supplying
no
guarantees
for
the
future
and
so
long
as
rationalists
of
the
encyclopaedic
school
regarded
religion
as
a
tiresome
product
of
ignorance
and
deceit
the
social
philosophy
which
lay
behind
the
theory
of
progress
was
condemned
as
unscientific
because
in
defiance
of
the
close
cohesion
of
social
phenomena
it
refused
to
admit
that
religion
as
one
of
the
chief
of
those
phenomena
must
itself
participate
and
in
progress
condorcet
had
suggested
that
the
value
of
history
lies
in
affording
data
for
foreseeing
the
future
raised
this
suggestion
to
a
dogma
but
prevision
was
impossible
on
condorcet
unscientific
method
in
order
to
foretell
the
law
of
the
movement
must
be
discovered
and
condorcet
had
not
found
or
even
sought
a
law
the
eighteenth
century
thinkers
had
left
progress
a
mere
hypothesis
based
on
a
very
insufficient
induction
their
successors
sought
to
lift
it
to
the
rank
of
a
scientific
hypothesis
by
discovering
a
social
law
as
valid
as
the
physical
law
of
gravitation
this
was
the
object
both
of
and
of
comte
the
law
which
educed
from
history
was
that
epochs
of
organisation
or
construction
and
epochs
of
criticism
or
revolution
succeed
each
other
alternately
the
medieval
period
was
a
time
of
organisation
and
was
followed
by
a
critical
revolutionary
period
which
has
now
come
to
an
end

must
be
succeeded

played
in

is
social
happiness

as

the

step
towards

the

saw
in

imagined
that

step
would
have
been
taken

of

he
was

to
him
for
the
principle

lay
at
the
very
basis
of
his
system
that
the
social
phenomena
of
a

period
and
the
intellectual
state
of
the
society
cohere
and
correspond
the
conception
that
the

was
to
be
a
period
of
organisation
like
the
middle
ages
and
the
idea
of
the
government
of
savants
are
pure
doctrine
and
the
fundamental
idea
of
a
positive
philosophy
had
been
apprehended
by
long
before
he
was
acquainted
with
his
youthful
associate
but
comte
had
a
more
methodical
and
scientific
mind
and
he
thought
that
was
premature
in
drawing
conclusions
as
to
the
reformation
of
societies
and
industries
before
the
positive
philosophy
had
been
constructed
he
published
he
was
then
only
in
a
plan
of
the
scientific
operations
necessary
for
the
of
society
which
was
published
under
another

footnote
with
vol
the
law
of
three
stages
is
familiar
to
many
who
have
never
read
a
line
of
his
writings
that
men
first
attempted
to
explain
natural
phenomena
by
the
operation
of
imaginary
deities
then
sought
to
interpret
them
by
abstractions
and
finally
came
to
see
that
they
could
only
be
understood
by
scientific
methods
observation
and
experiment
this
was
a
generalisation
which
had
already
been
thrown
out
by
turgot
comte
adopted
it
as
a
fundamental
psychological
law
which
has
governed
every
domain
of
mental
activity
and
explains
the
whole
story
of
human
development
each
of
our
principal
conceptions
every
branch
of
knowledge
passes
successively
through
these
three
states
which
he
names
the
theological
the
metaphysical
and
the
positive
or
scientific
in
the
first
the
mind
invents
in
the
second
it
abstracts
in
the
third
it
submits
itself
to
positive
facts
and
the
proof
that
any
branch
of
knowledge
has
reached
the
third
stage
is
the
recognition
of
invariable
natural
laws
but
granting
that
this
may
be
the
key
to
the
history
of
the
sciences
of
physics
say
or
botany
how
can
it
explain
the
history
of
man
the
sequence
of
actual
historical
events
comte
replies
that
history
has
been
governed
by
ideas
the
whole
social
mechanism
is
ultimately
based
on
opinions
thus
man
history
is
essentially
a
history
of
his
opinions
and
these
are
subject
to
the
fundamental
psychological
law
it
must
however
be
observed
that
all
branches
of
knowledge
are
not
in
the
same
stage
simultaneously
some
may
have
reached
the
metaphysical
while
others
are
still
lagging
behind
in
the
theological
some
may
have
become
scientific
while
others
have
not
passed
from
the
metaphysical
thus
the
study
of
physical
phenomena
has
already
reached
the
positive
stage
but
the
study
of
social
phenomena
has
not
the
central
aim
of
comte
and
his
great
achievement
in
his
own
opinion
was
to
raise
the
study
of
social
phenomena
from
the
second
to
the
third
stage
when
we
proceed
to
apply
the
law
of
the
three
stages
to
the
general
course
of
historical
development
we
are
met
at
the
outset
by
the
difficulty
that
the
advance
in
all
the
domains
of
activity
is
not
simultaneous
if
at
a
given
period
thought
and
opinions
are
partly
in
the
theological
partly
in
the
metaphysical
and
partly
in
the
scientific
state
how
is
the
law
to
be
applied
to
general
development
one
class
of
ideas
comte
says
must
be
selected
as
the
criterion
and
this
class
must
be
that
of
social
and
moral
ideas
for
two
reasons
in
the
first
place
social
science
occupies
the
highest
rank
in
the
hierarchy
of
sciences
on
which
he
laid
great
stress

in
the

those
ideas
play
the
principal
part
for
the
majority
of
men
and
the
most
ordinary
phenomena
are
the
most
important
to
consider
when
in
other
classes
of
ideas
the
advance
is
at
any
time
more
rapid
this
only
means
an
indispensable
preparation
for
the
ensuing
period
the
movement
of
history
is
due
to
the
deeply
rooted
though
complex
instinct
which
pushes
man
to
ameliorate
his
condition
incessantly
to
develop
in
all
ways
the
sum
of
his
physical
moral
and
intellectual
life
and
all
the
phenomena
of
his
social
life
are
closely
cohesive
as
had
pointed
out
by
virtue
of
this
cohesion
political
moral
and
intellectual
progress
are
inseparable
from
material
progress
and
so
we
find
that
the
phases
of
his
material
development
correspond
to
intellectual
changes
the
principle
of
consensus
or
solidarity
which
secures
harmony
and
order
in
the
development
is
as
important
as
the
principle
of
the
three
stages
which
governs
the
onward
movement
this
movement
however
is
not
in
a
right
line
but
displays
a
series
of
oscillations
unequal
and
variable
round
a
mean
motion
which
tends
to
prevail
the
three
general
causes
of
variation
according
to
comte
are
race
climate
and
deliberate
political
action
such
as
the
retrograde
policies
of
julian
the
apostate
or
napoleon
but
while
they
cause
deflections
and
oscillation
their
power
is
strictly
limited
they
may
accelerate
or
retard
the
movement
but
they
can
not
invert
its
order
they
may
affect
the
intensity
of
the
tendencies
in
a
given
situation
but
can
not
change
their
nature
in
the
demonstration
of
his
laws
by
the
actual
course
of
civilisation
comte
adopts
what
he
calls
the
happy
artifice
of
condorcet
and
treats
the
successive
peoples
who
pass
on
the
torch
as
if
they
were
a
single
people
running
the
race
this
is
a
rational
fiction
for
a
true
successors
are
those
who
pursue
its
efforts
and
like
bossuet
and
condorcet
he
confined
his
review
to
european
civilisation
he
considered
only
the
elite
or
advance
guard
of
humanity
he
deprecated
the
introduction
of
china
or
india
for
instance
as
a
confusing
complication
he
ignored
the
roles
of
brahmanism
buddhism
mohammedanism
his
synthesis
therefore
can
not
claim
to
be
a
synthesis
of
universal
history
it
is
only
a
synthesis
of
the
movement
of
european
history
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
three
stages
the
development
falls
into
three
great
periods
the
first
or
theological
came
to
an
end
about
and
the
second
or
metaphysical
is
now
nearing
its
close
to
make
way
for
the
third
or
positive
for
which
comte
was
preparing
the
way
the
theological
period
has
itself
three
stages
in
which
fetishism
polytheism
and
monotheism
successively
prevail
the
chief
social
characteristics
of
the
polytheistic
period
are
the
institution
of
slavery
and
the
coincidence
or
confusion
of
the
spiritual
and
temporal
powers
it
has
two
stages
the
theocratic
represented
by
egypt
and
the
military
represented
by
rome
between
which
greece
stands
in
a
rather
embarrassing
and
uneasy
position
the
initiative
for
the
passage
to
the
monotheistic
period
came
from
judaea
and
comte
attempts
to
show
that
this
could
not
have
been
otherwise
his
analysis
of
this
period
is
the
most
interesting
part
of
his
survey
the
chief
feature
of
the
political
system
corresponding
to
monotheism
is
the
separation
of
the
spiritual
and
temporal
powers
the
function
of
the
spiritual
power
being
concerned
with
education
and
that
of
the
temporal
with
action
in
the
wide
senses
of
those
terms
the
defects
of
this
dual
system
were
due
to
the
irrational
theology
but
the
theory
of
papal
infallibility
was
a
great
step
in
intellectual
and
social
progress
by
providing
a
final
jurisdiction
without
which
society
would
have
been
troubled
incessantly
by
contests
arising
from
the
vague
formulae
of
dogmas
here
comte
had
learned
from
joseph
de
maistre
but
that
thinker
would
not
have
been
edified
when
comte
went
on
to
declare
that
in
the
passage
from
polytheism
to
monotheism
the
religious
spirit
had
really
declined
and
that
one
of
the
merits
of
catholicism
was
that
it
augmented
the
domain
of
human
wisdom
at
the
expense
of
divine
inspiration
footnote
cours
de
philosophic
positive
vi
if
it
be
said
that
the
catholic
system
promoted
the
empire
of
the
clergy
rather
than
the
interests
of
religion
this
was
all
to
the
good
for
it
placed
the
practical
use
of
religion
in
the
provisional
elevation
of
a
noble
speculative
corporation
eminently
able
to
direct
opinions
and
morals
but
catholic
monotheism
could
not
escape
dissolution
the
metaphysical
spirit
began
to
operate
powerfully
on
the
notions
of
moral
philosophy
as
soon
as
the
catholic
organisation
was
complete
and
catholicism
because
it
could
not
assimilate
this
intellectual
movement
lost
its
progressive
character
and
stagnated
the
decay
began
in
the
fourteenth
century
where
comte
dates
the
beginning
of
the
metaphysical
period
a
period
of
revolution
and
disorder
in
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
the
movement
is
spontaneous
and
unconscious
from
the
sixteenth
till
it
has
proceeded
under
the
direction
of
a
philosophical
spirit
which
is
negative
and
not
constructive
this
critical
philosophy
has
only
accelerated
a
decomposition
which
began
spontaneously
for
as
theology
progresses
it
becomes
less
consistent
and
less
durable
and
as
its
conceptions
become
less
irrational
the
intensity
of
the
emotions
which
they
excite
decreases
fetishism
had
deeper
roots
than
polytheism
and
lasted
longer
and
polytheism
surpassed
monotheism
in
vigour
and
vitality
yet
the
critical
philosophy
was
necessary
to
exhibit
the
growing
need
of
solid
reorganisation
and
to
prove
that
the
decaying
system
was
incapable
of
directing
the
world
any
longer
logically
it
was
very
imperfect
but
it
was
justified
by
its
success
the
destructive
work
was
mainly
done
in
the
seventeenth
century
by
hobbes
spinoza
and
bayle
of
whom
hobbes
was
the
most
effective
in
the
eighteenth
all
prominent
thinkers
participated
in
developing
this
negative
movement
and
rousseau
gave
it
the
practical
stimulus
which
saved
it
from
degenerating
into
an
unfruitful
agitation
of
particular
importance
was
the
great
fallacy
which
helvetius
propagated
that
human
intellects
are
equal
this
error
was
required
for
the
full
development
of
the
critical
doctrine
for
it
supported
the
dogmas
of
popular
sovranty
and
social
equality
and
justified
the
principle
of
the
right
of
private
judgement
these
three
principles
popular
sovranty
equality
and
what
he
calls
the
right
of
free
examination
are
in
comte
eyes
vicious
and
anarchical
footnote
op
cit
iv
but
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
be
promulgated
because
the
transition
from
one
organised
social
system
to
another
can
not
be
direct
it
requires
an
anarchical
interregnum
popular
sovranty
is
opposed
to
orderly
institutions
and
condemns
all
superior
persons
to
dependence
on
the
multitude
of
their
inferiors
equality
obviously
anarchical
in
its
tendency
and
obviously
untrue
for
as
men
are
not
equal
or
even
equivalent
to
one
another
their
rights
can
not
be
identical
was
similarly
necessary
to
break
down
the
old
institutions
the
universal
claim
to
the
right
of
free
judgement
merely
consecrates
the
transitional
state
of
unlimited
liberty
in
the
interim
between
the
decline
of
theology
and
the
arrival
of
positive
philosophy
comte
further
remarks
that
the
fall
of
the
spiritual
power
had
led
to
anarchy
in
international
relations
and
if
the
spirit
of
nationality
were
to
prevail
too
far
the
result
would
be
a
state
of
things
inferior
to
that
of
the
middle
ages
but
comte
says
for
the
metaphysical
spirit
in
france
that
with
all
its
vices
it
was
more
disengaged
from
the
prejudices
of
the
old
theological
regime
and
nearer
to
a
true
rational
positivism
than
either
the
german
mysticism
or
the
english
empiricism
of
the
same
period
the
revolution
was
a
necessity
to
disclose
the
chronic
decomposition
of
society
from
which
it
resulted
and
to
liberate
the
modern
social
elements
from
the
grip
of
the
ancient
powers
comte
has
praise
for
the
convention
which
he
contrasts
with
the
constituent
assembly
with
its
political
fictions
and
inconsistencies
he
pointed
out
that
the
great
vice
in
the
metaphysics
of
the
crisis
that
is
in
the
principles
of
the
revolutionaries
lay
in
conceiving
society
out
of
relation
to
the
past
in
ignoring
the
middle
ages
and
borrowing
from
greek
and
roman
society
retrograde
and
contradictory
ideals
napoleon
restored
order
but
he
was
more
injurious
to
humanity
than
any
other
historical
person
his
moral
and
intellectual
nature
was
incompatible
with
the
true
direction
of
progress
which
involves
the
extinction
of
the
theological
and
military
regime
of
the
past
thus
his
work
like
julian
the
apostate
exhibits
an
instance
of
deflection
from
the
line
of
progress
then
came
the
parliamentary
system
of
the
restored
bourbons
which
comte
designates
as
a
political
utopia
destitute
of
social
principles
a
foolish
attempt
to
combine
political
retrogression
with
a
state
of
permanent
peace
the
critical
doctrine
has
performed
its
historical
function
and
the
time
has
come
for
man
to
enter
upon
the
positive
stage
of
his
career
to
enable
him
to
take
this
step
forward
it
is
necessary
that
the
study
of
social
phenomena
should
become
a
positive
science
as
social
science
is
the
highest
in
the
hierarchy
of
sciences
it
could
not
develop
until
the
two
branches
of
knowledge
which
come
next
in
the
scale
biology
and
chemistry
assumed
a
scientific
form
this
has
recently
been
achieved
and
it
is
now
possible
to
found
a
scientific
sociology
this
science
like
mechanics
and
biology
has
its
statics
and
its
dynamics
the
first
studies
the
laws
of
the
second
those
of
succession
the
first
contains
the
theory
of
order
the
second
that
of
progress
the
law
of
consensus
or
cohesion
is
the
fundamental
principle
of
social
statics
the
law
of
the
three
stages
is
that
of
social
dynamics
comte
survey
of
history
of
which
i
have
briefly
indicated
the
general
character
exhibits
the
application
of
these
sociological
laws
the
capital
feature
of
the
third
period
which
we
are
now
approaching
will
be
the
organisation
of
society
by
means
of
scientific
sociology
the
world
will
be
guided
by
a
general
theory
and
this
means
that
it
must
be
controlled
by
those
who
understand
the
theory
and
will
know
how
to
apply
it
therefore
society
will
revive
the
principle
which
was
realised
in
the
great
period
of
monotheism
the
distinction
of
a
spiritual
and
a
temporal
order
but
the
spiritual
order
will
consist
of
savants
who
will
direct
social
life
not
by
theological
fictions
but
by
the
positive
truths
of
science
they
will
administer
a
system
of
universal
education
and
will
draw
up
the
final
code
of
ethics
they
will
be
able
more
effectively
than
the
church
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
lower
classes
comte
conviction
that
the
world
is
prepared
for
a
transformation
of
this
kind
is
based
principally
on
signs
of
the
decline
of
the
theological
spirit
and
of
the
military
spirit
which
he
regarded
as
the
two
main
obstacles
to
the
reign
of
reason
catholicism
he
says
is
now
no
more
than
an
imposing
historical
ruin
as
for
militarism
the
epoch
has
arrived
in
which
serious
and
lasting
warfare
among
the
elite
nations
will
totally
cease
the
last
general
cause
of
warfare
has
been
the
competition
for
colonies
but
the
colonial
policy
is
now
in
its
decadence
with
the
temporary
exception
of
england
so
that
we
need
not
look
for
future
trouble
from
this
source
the
very
sophism
sometimes
put
forward
to
justify
war
that
it
is
an
instrument
of
civilisation
is
a
homage
to
the
pacific
nature
of
modern
society
we
need
not
follow
further
the
details
of
comte
forecast
of
the
positive
period
except
to
mention
that
he
did
not
contemplate
a
political
federation
the
great
european
nations
will
develop
each
in
its
own
way
with
their
separate
temporal
organisations
but
he
contemplated
the
intervention
of
a
common
spiritual
power
so
that
all
nationalities
under
the
direction
of
a
homogeneous
speculative
class
will
contribute
to
an
identical
work
in
a
spirit
of
active
european
patriotism
not
of
sterile
cosmopolitanism
comte
claimed
like
that
the
data
of
history
scientifically
interpreted
afford
the
means
of
prevision
it
is
interesting
to
observe
how
he
failed
himself
as
a
diviner
how
utterly
he
misapprehended
the
vitality
of
catholicism
how
completely
his
prophecy
as
to
the
cessation
of
wars
was
belied
by
the
event
he
lived
to
see
the
crimean
war
footnote
he
died
in
as
a
diviner
he
failed
as
completely
as
and
fourier
whose
dream
that
the
nineteenth
century
would
see
the
beginning
of
an
epoch
of
harmony
and
happiness
was
to
be
fulfilled
by
a
deadly
struggle
between
capitalism
and
labour
the
civil
war
in
america
the
war
of
the
commune
russian
pogroms
armenian
massacres
and
finally
the
universal
catastrophe
of
for
the
comprehension
of
history
we
have
perhaps
gained
as
little
from
comte
positive
laws
as
from
hegel
metaphysical
categories
both
thinkers
had
studied
the
facts
of
history
only
slightly
and
partially
a
rather
serious
drawback
which
enabled
them
to
impose
their
own
constructions
with
the
greater
ease
hegel
method
of
a
priori
synthesis
was
enjoined
by
his
philosophical
theory
but
in
comte
we
also
find
a
tendency
to
a
priori
treatment
he
expressly
remarks
that
the
chief
social
features
of
the
monotheistic
period
might
almost
be
constructed
a
priori
the
law
of
the
three
stages
is
discredited
it
may
be
contended
that
general
progress
depends
on
intellectual
progress
and
that
theology
metaphysics
and
science
have
common
roots
and
are
ultimately
identical
being
merely
phases
in
the
movement
of
the
intelligence
but
the
law
of
this
movement
if
it
is
to
rank
as
a
scientific
hypothesis
must
be
properly
deduced
from
known
causes
and
must
then
be
verified
by
a
comparison
with
historical
facts
comte
thought
that
he
fulfilled
these
requirements
but
in
both
respects
his
demonstration
was
defective
footnote
criticism
of
comte
assumption
that
civilisation
begins
with
animism
weber
criticisms
from
this
point
of
view
are
telling
le
rythme
du
progres
he
observes
that
if
comte
had
not
left
the
practical
and
active
side
of
intelligence
in
the
shade
and
considered
only
its
speculative
side
he
could
not
have
formulated
the
law
of
the
three
stages
he
would
have
seen
that
the
positive
explanation
of
phenomena
has
played
in
every
period
a
preponderant
role
though
latent
in
the
march
of
the
human
mind
weber
himself
suggests
a
scheme
of
two
states
corresponding
to
the
of
the
intellect
technical
and
speculative
practical
and
theoretical
through
the
alternation
of
which
intellectual
progress
has
been
effected
the
first
stage
was
probably
practical
he
calls
it
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
when
comte
was
constructing
his
system
palaeontology
was
in
its
infancy
the
gravest
weakness
perhaps
in
his
historical
sketch
is
the
gratuitous
assumption
that
man
in
the
earliest
stage
of
his
existence
had
animistic
beliefs
and
that
the
first
phase
of
his
progress
was
controlled
by
fetishism
there
is
no
valid
evidence
that
fetishism
is
not
a
relatively
late
development
or
that
in
the
myriads
of
years
stretching
back
beyond
our
earliest
records
during
which
men
decided
the
future
of
the
human
species
by
their
technical
inventions
and
the
discovery
of
fire
they
had
any
views
which
could
be
called
religious
or
theological
the
psychology
of
modern
savages
is
no
clew
to
the
minds
of
the
people
who
wrought
tools
of

in
the

of
the

and

was

such
critical
importance

his
destinies

progress

it
does
not
cover
the

in
another
way
comte
system
may
be
criticised
for
failing
to
cover
the
ground
if
it
is
regarded
as
a
philosophy
of
history
in
accordance
with
the
happy
artifice
of
condorcet
he
assumes
that
the
growth
of
european
civilisation
is
the
only
history
that
matters
and
discards
entirely
the
civilisations
for
instance
of
india
and
china
this
assumption
is
much
more
than
an
artifice
and
he
has
not
scientifically
justified
it
footnote

the

but
pluralistic
teggart

history
the
reader
of
the
philosophie
positive
will
also
observe
that
comte
has
not
grappled
with
a
fundamental
question
which
has
to
be
faced
in
unravelling
the
woof
of
history
or
seeking
a
law
of
events
i
mean
the
question
of
contingency
it
must
be
remembered
that
contingency
does
not
in
the
least
affect
the
doctrine
of
determinism
it
is
compatible
with
the
strictest
interpretation
of
the
principle
of
causation
a
particular
example
may
be
taken
to
show
what
it
implies

i
sqq
i
have
discussed
the
subject
and
given
some
illustrations
in
a
short
paper
entitled
cleopatra
nose
in
the
annual
of
the
rationalist
press
association
for
it
may
plausibly
be
argued
that
a
military
dictatorship
was
an
inevitable
sequence
of
the
french
revolution
this
may
not
be
true
but
let
us
assume
it
let
us
further
assume
that
given
napoleon
it
was
inevitable
that
he
should
be
the
dictator
but
napoleon
existence
was
due
to
an
independent
causal
chain
which
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
course
of
political
events
he
might
have
died
in
his
boyhood
by
disease
or
by
an
accident
and
the
fact
that
he
survived
was
due
to
causes
which
were
similarly
independent
of
the
causal
chain
which
as
we
are
assuming
led
necessarily
to
an
epoch
of
monarchical
government
the
existence
of
a
man
of
his
genius
and
character
at
the
given
moment
was
a
contingency
which
profoundly
affected
the
course
of
history
if
he
had
not
been
there
another
dictator
would
have
grasped
the
helm
but
obviously
would
not
have
done
what
napoleon
did
it
is
clear
that
the
whole
history
of
man
has
been
modified
at
every
stage
by
such
contingencies
which
may
be
defined
as
the
collisions
of
two
independent
causal
chains
voltaire
was
perfectly
right
when
he
emphasised
the
role
of
chance
in
history
though
he
did
not
realise
what
it
meant
this
factor
would
explain
the
oscillations
and
deflections
which
comte
admits
in
the
movement
of
historical
progression
but
the
question
arises
whether
it
may
not
also
have
once
and
again
definitely
altered
the
direction
of
the
movement
can
the
factor
be
regarded
as
virtually
negligible
by
those
who
like
comte
are
concerned
with
the
large
perspective
of
human
development
and
not
with
the
details
of
an
episode
or
was
renouvier
right
in
principle
when
he
maintained
the
real
possibility
that
the
sequence
of
events
from
the
emperor
nerva
to
the
emperor
charlemagne
might
have
been
radically
different
from
what
it
actually
was
footnote
he
illustrated
this
proposition
by
a
fanciful
reconstruction
of
european
history
from
to
in
his
uchronie
he
contended
that
there
is
no
definite
law
of
progress
the
true
law
lies
in
the
equal
possibility
of
progress
or
regress
for
societies
as
for
individuals
it
does
not
concern
us
here
to
examine
the
defects
of
comte
view
of
the
course
of
european
history
but
it
interests
us
to
observe
that
his
synthesis
of
human
progress
is
like
hegel
what
i
have
called
a
closed
system
just
as
his
own
absolute
philosophy
marked
for
hegel
the
highest
and
ultimate
term
of
human
development
so
for
comte
the
coming
society
whose
organisation
he
adumbrated
was
the
final
state
of
humanity
beyond
which
there
would
be
no
further
movement
it
would
take
time
to
perfect
the
organisation
and
the
period
would
witness
a
continuous
increase
of
knowledge
but
the
main
characteristics
were
definitely
fixed
comte
did
not
conceive
that
the
distant
future
could
he
survive
to
experience
it
could
contain
any
surprises
for
him
his
theory
of
progress
thus
differed
from
the
eighteenth
century
views
which
vaguely
contemplate
an
indefinite
development
and
only
profess
to
indicate
some
general
tendencies
he
expressly
repudiated
this
notion
of
indefinite
progress
the
data
he
said
justify
only
the
inference
of
continuous
progress
which
is
a
different
thing
a
second
point
in
which
comte
in
his
view
of
progress
differed
from
the
french
philosophers
of
the
preceding
age
is
this
condorcet
and
his
predecessors
regarded
it
exclusively
from
the
eudaemonic
point
of
view
the
goal
of
progress
for
them
was
the
attainment
of
human
felicity
with
felicity
comte
is
hardly
more
concerned
than
hegel
the
establishment
of
a
fuller
harmony
between
men
and
their
environment
in
the
third
stage
will
no
doubt
mean
happiness
but
this
consideration
lies
outside
the
theory
and
to
introduce
it
would
only
intrude
an
unscientific
element
into
the
analysis
the
course
of
development
is
determined
by
intellectual
ideas
and
he
treats
these
as
independent
of
and
indifferent
to
eudaemonic
motives
a
third
point
to
be
noted
is
the
authoritarian
character
of
the
regime
of
the
future
comte
ideal
state
would
be
as
ill
to
live
in
for
any
unfortunate
being
who
values
personal
liberty
as
a
theocracy
or
any
socialistic
utopia
he
had
as
little
sympathy
with
liberty
as
plato
or
as
bossuet
and
less
than
the
eighteenth
century
philosophers
this
feature
common
to
comte
and
the
was
partly
due
to
the
reaction
against
the
revolution
but
it
also
resulted
from
the
logic
of
the
man
of
science
if
sociological
laws
are
positively
established
as
certainly
as
the
law
of
gravitation
no
room
is
left
for
opinion
right
social
conduct
is
definitely
fixed
the
proper
functions
of
every
member
of
society
admit
of
no
question
therefore
the
claim
to
liberty
is
perverse
and
irrational
it
is
the
same
argument
which
some
modern
exponents
of
eugenics
use
to
advocate
a
state
tyranny
in
the
matter
of
human
breeding
when
comte
was
writing
the
progressive
movement
in
europe
was
towards
increase
of
liberty
in
all
its
forms
national
civic
political
and
economical
on
one
hand
there
was
the
agitation
for
the
release
of
oppressed
nationalities
on
the
other
the
growth
of
liberalism
in
england
and
france
the
aim
of
the
liberalism
of
that
period
was
to
restrict
the
functions
of
government
its
spirit
was
distrust
of
the
state
as
a
political
theory
it
was
defective
as
modern
liberals
acknowledge
but
it
was
an
important
expression
of
the
feeling
that
the
interests
of
society
are
best
furthered
by
the
free
interplay
of
individual
actions
and
aims
it
thus
implicitly
contained
or
pointed
to
a
theory
of
progress
sharply
opposed
to
comte
that
the
realisation
of
the
fullest
possible
measure
of
individual
liberty
is
the
condition
of
ensuring
the
maximum
of
energy
and
effectiveness
in
improving
our
environment
and
therefore
the
condition
of
attaining
public
felicity
right
or
wrong
this
theory
reckons
with
fundamental
facts
of
human
nature
which
comte
ignored
comte
spent
the
later
years
of
his
life
in
composing
another
huge
work
on
social
reorganisation
it
included
a
new
religion
in
which
humanity
was
the
object
of
worship
but
made
no
other
important
addition
to
the
speculations
of
his
earlier
manhood
though
he
developed
them
further
the
course
of
positive
philosophy
was
not
a
book
that
took
the
public
by
storm
we
are
told
by
a
competent
student
of
social
theories
in
france
that
the
author
name
was
little
known
in
his
own
country
till
about
when
his
greatness
began
to
win
recognition
and
his
influence
to
operate

even
then
his
work
can
hardly
have
been
widely

through
men
like

whose
conceptions
of
history
were
moulded
by
his
teaching
and
men

he

the
influence
of
comte
the
manner
in
which
ideas
filter
through
as
it
were
underground
and
emerge
oblivious
of
their
source
is
illustrated
by
the
german
historian
lamprecht
theory
of
historical
development
he
surveyed
the
history
of
a
people
as
a
series
of
what
he
called
typical
periods
each
of
which
is
marked
by
a
collective
psychical
character
expressing
itself
in
every
department
of
life
he
named
this
a
diapason
lamprecht
had
never
read
comte
and
he
imagined
that
this
principle
on
which
he
based
his
kulturhistorische
methode
was
original
but
his
psychical
diapason
is
the
psychical
consensus
of
comte
whose
system
as
we
have
seen
depended
on
the
proposition
that
a
given
social
organisation
corresponds
in
a
definite
way
to
the
contemporary
stage
of
mental
development
and
comte
had
derived
the
principle
from
cf
his
pamphlet
die
kulturhistorische
methode
the
succession
of
typical
period
was
worked
out
for
germany
in
his
history
of
the
german
people
he
laid
the
foundations
of
sociology
convincing
many
minds
that
the
history
of
civilisation
is
subject
to
general
laws
or
in
other
words
that
a
science
of
society
is
possible
in
england
this
idea
was
still
a
novelty
when
mill
system
of
logic
appeared
in
the
publication
of
this
work
which
attempted
to
define
the
rules
for
the
investigation
of
truth
in
all
fields
of
inquiry
and
to
provide
tests
for
the
hypotheses
of
science
was
a
considerable
event
whether
we
regard
its
value
and
range
or
its
prolonged
influence
on
education
mill
who
had
followed
recent
french
thought
attentively
and
was
particularly
impressed
by
the
system
of
comte
recognised
that
a
new
method
of
investigating
social
phenomena
had
been
inaugurated
by
the
thinkers
who
set
out
to
discover
the
law
of
human
progression
he
proclaimed
and
welcomed
it
as
superior
to
previous
methods
and
at
the
same
time
pointed
out
its
limitations
till
about
fifty
years
ago
he
said
generalisations
on
man
and
society
have
erred
by
implicitly
assuming
that
human
nature
and
society
will
for
ever
revolve
in
the
same
orbit
and
exhibit
virtually
the
same
phenomena
this
is
still
the
view
of
the
ostentatiously
practical
votaries
of
common
sense
in
great
britain
whereas
the
more
reflective
minds
of
the
present
age
analysing
historical
records
more
minutely
have
adopted
the
opinion
that
the
human
race
is
in
a
state
of
necessary
progression
the
reciprocal
action
between
circumstances
and
human
nature
from
which
social
phenomena
result
must
produce
either
a
cycle
or
a
trajectory
while
vico
maintained
the
conception
of
periodic
cycles
his
successors
have
universally
adopted
the
idea
of
a
trajectory
or
progress
and
are
endeavouring
to
discover
its
law

philosophical

of

attention

forgotten

view
of

that
eclecticism
is
the
philosophy
of
human

vol

he
conceived
the
movement
of
humanity
as
that
of
a
spiral
ever
tending
to
a
higher
perfection
but
they
have
fallen
into
a
misconception
in
imagining
that
if
they
can
find
a
law
of
uniformity
in
the
succession
of
events
they
can
infer
the
future
from
the
past
terms
of
the
series
for
such
a
law
would
only
be
an
empirical
law
it
would
not
be
a
causal
law
or
an
ultimate
law
however
rigidly
uniform
there
is
no
guarantee
that
it
would
apply
to
phenomena
outside
those
from
which
it
was
derived
it
must
itself
depend
on
laws
of
mind
and
character
psychology
and
ethology
when
those
laws
are
known
and
the
nature
of
the
dependence
is
explained
when
the
determining
causes
of
all
the
changes
constituting
the
progress
are
understood
then
the
empirical
law
will
be
elevated
to
a
scientific
law
then
only
will
it
be
possible
to
predict
thus
mill
asserted
that
if
the
advanced
thinkers
who
are
engaged
on
the
subject
succeed
in
discovering
an
empirical
law
from
the
data
of
history
it
may
be
converted
into
a
scientific
law
by
deducing
it
a
priori
from
the
principles
of
human
nature
in
the
meantime
he
argued
that
what
is
already
known
of
those
principles
justifies
the
important
conclusion
that
the
order
of
general
human
progression
will
mainly
depend
on
the
order
of
progression
in
the
intellectual
convictions
of
mankind
throughout
his
exposition
mill
uses
progress
in
a
neutral
sense
without
implying
that
the
progression
necessarily
means
improvement
social
science
has
still
to
demonstrate
that
the
changes
determined
by
human
nature
do
mean
improvement
but
in
warning
the
reader
of
this
he
declares
himself
to
be
personally
an
optimist
believing
that
the
general
tendency
saving
temporary
exceptions
is
in
the
direction
of
a
better
and
happier
state

mill
was
able
to
say

the

his
purpose
was
to
investigate
its
causes
considering
the
two

all

human

he
arrived
at
two
conclusions
in
the
early
stage
of
history
the
influence
of
external
environment
is
the
more
decisive
factor
but
as
time
goes
on
the
roles
are
gradually
inverted
and
now
it
is
his
own
nature
that
is
principally
responsible
for
his
development
progress
is
determined
not
by
the
emotional

by
the
intellect
footnote
this

the
view

the

i
pledge
myself
to
show
that
the
progress
europe
has
made
from
barbarism
to
civilisation
is
entirely
due
to
its
intellectual
activity
in
what
may
be
called
the
innate
and

is

buckle
was
convinced
that
social
phenomena
exhibit
the
same
undeviating
regularity
as
natural
phenomena
in
this
belief
he
was
chiefly
influenced
by
the
investigations
of
the
belgian
statistician
quetelet
statistics
he
said
has
already
thrown
more
light
on
the
study
of

all
the

put
together
from
the
regularity
with
which
the
same
crimes
recur
in
the
same
state
of
society
and
many
other
constant
averages
he
inferred
that
all
actions
of
individuals
result
directly
from
the
state
of
society
in
which
they
live
and
that
laws
are
operating

if
we
take
large
enough
numbers
into

scarcely
undergo
any
sensible
perturbation
footnote
kant
had
already
appealed
to
statistics
in
a
similar
sense
see
above
p
thus
the
evidence
of
statistics
points
to
the
conclusion
that
progress
is
not
determined
by
the
acts
of
individual
men
but
depends
on
general
laws
of
the
intellect
which
govern
the
successive
stages
of
public
opinion
the
totality
of
human
actions
at
any
given
time
depends
on
the
totality
of
knowledge
and
the
extent
of
its
diffusion
there
we
have
the
theory
that
history
is
subject
to
general
laws
in
its
most
unqualified
form
based
on
a
fallacious
view
of
the
significance
of
statistical
facts
buckle
attempt
to
show
the
operation
of
general
laws
in
the
actual
history
of
man
was
disappointing
when
he
went
on
to
review
the
concrete
facts
of
the
historical
process
his
own
political
principles
came
into
play
and
he
was
more
concerned
with
denouncing
the
tendencies
of
which
he
did
not
approve
than
with
extricating
general
laws
from
the
sequence
of
events
his
comments
on
religious
persecution
and
the
obscurantism
of
governments
and
churches
were
instructive
and
timely
but
they
did
not
do
much
to
exhibit
a
set
of
rigid
laws
governing
and
explaining
the
course
of
human
development
the
doctrine
that
history
is
under
the
irresistible
control
of
law
was
also
popularised
by
an
american
physiologist
draper
whose
history
of
the
intellectual
development
of

appeared
in
and
was
widely
read

was
a
superficial

as
completely

therefore
european

exhibits

draper
conclusion
was
that
europe
now
in
the
fourth
period
is
hastening
to
a
long
period
of
decrepitude
the
prospect
did
not
dismay
him
decrepitude
is
the
culmination
of

already
been
achieved

much
inferior

both
these
books
utterly
different

they
were
in
both
conception

performed
a
similar
function

in

interpret

as

while
all

by
invoking
the

it
was
quite
true
that
during

nearly
all
serious

were
related
to
that

when
his

translated

unreasonable
notwithstanding
his
communistic
theory
of

he
was
a
strong
individualist
he
held
that
the

the

of
individuals
that
liberty
is
a
condition
of
its
advance
and
that
the
end
to
be
kept
in
view
is
the
establishment
of
justice
which
means
equality
he
saw
the
difficulty
of
reconciling
liberty
with
complete
equality
but
hoped
that
the
incompatibility
would
be
overcome
by
a
gradual
reduction
of
the
natural
differences
in
men
capacities
he
said
i
am
an
anarchist

his
anarchy
only
meant
that
the
time
would
come
when
government
would
be
superfluous
when
every
human
being
could
be
trusted
to
act
wisely
and
morally
without
a
restraining
authority

external
sanctions
nor
was
he
a
utopian
he
comprehended
that
such
a
transformation
of
society
would
be
a
long
slow
process
and
he
condemned
the
schools
of
and
fourier
for
imagining
that
a
millennium
might
be
realised
immediately
by
a
change
of
organisation
he
tells
us
that
all
his
speculations
and
controversial
activities
are
penetrated
with
the
idea
of
progress
which
he
described
as
the
railway
of
liberty
and
his
radical
criticism
on
current
social
theories
whether
conservative
or

was
that
they
did
not
take
progress
seriously

invoked
it

just
his
influence

his

was

he
was
one
of
the
minor
forces
in
the
thought
of
the
period
and
there
are
some
features
in
his
theory
which
deserve
to
be
pointed
out
leroux
had
begun
as
a
member
of
the
school
but
he
diverged
into
a
path
of
his
own
he
reinstated
the
ideal
of
equality
which
rejected
and
made
the
approach
to
that
ideal
the
measure
of
progress
the
most
significant
process
in
history
he
held
is
the
gradual
breaking
down
of
caste
and
class
the
process
is
now
approaching
its
completion
today
man
is
synonymous
with
equal
in
order
to
advance
to
the
city
of
the
future
we
must
have
a
force
and
a
lever
man
is
the
force
and
the
lever
is
the
idea
of
progress
it
is
supplied
by
the
study
of
history
which
displays
the
improvement
of
our
faculties
the
increase
of
our
power
over
nature
the
possibility
of
organising
society
more
efficaciously
but
the
force
and
the
lever
are
not
enough
a
fulcrum
is
also
required
and
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
solidarity
of
the
human
race
but
this
conception
meant
for
leroux
something
different
from
what
is
ordinarily
meant
by
the
phrase
a
deeper
and
even
mystical
bond
human
solidarity
was
a
corollary
from
the
pantheistic
religion
of
the
but
with
leroux
as
with
fourier
it
was
derived
from
the
more
difficult
doctrine
of
palingenesis
we
of
this
generation
he
believed
are
not
merely
the
sons
and
descendants
of
past
generations
we
are

it
is
easy
to
understand
the

a

for
it
would
provide
a
solution

the
anomaly

as

they
will
themselves
reach

palingenesis

the
author
was
then
convinced
that
history
has
a
goal
and
that
mankind
tends
perpetually
though
in
an
oscillating
line
towards
a
more
perfect
state
through
the
growing
dominion
of
reason
over
instinct
and
caprice
he
takes
the
french
revolution
as
the
critical
moment
in
which
humanity
first
came
to
know
itself
that
revolution
was
the
first
attempt
of
man
to
take
the
reins
into
his
own
hands
all
that
went
before
we
may
call
with
owen
the
irrational
period
of
human
existence
we
have
now
come
to
a
point
at
which
we
must
choose
between
two
faiths
if
we
despair
of
reason
we
may
find
a
refuge
from
utter
scepticism
in
a
belief
in
the
external
authority
of
the
roman
church
if
we
trust
reason
we
must
accept
the
march
of
the
human
mind
and
justify
the
modern
spirit
and
it
can
be
justified
only
by
proving
that
it
is
a
necessary
step
towards
perfection
renan
affirmed
his
belief
in
the
second
alternative
and
felt
confident
that
science
including
philology
on
the
human
bearings
of
which
he
enlarged
philosophy
and
art
would
ultimately
enable
men
to
realise
an
ideal
civilisation
in
which
all
would
be
equal
the
state
he
said
is
the
machine
of
progress
and
the
socialists
are
right
in
formulating
the
problem
which
man
has
to
solve
though
their
solution
is
a
bad
one
for
individual
liberty
which
socialism
would
seriously
limit
is
a
definite
conquest
and
ought
to
be
preserved
inviolate
renan
wrote
this
work
in

but
did
not
publish
it
at
the
time
he
gave
it
to
the
world
forty
years
later
those
forty
years
had
robbed
him
of
his
early
optimism
he
continues
to
believe
that
the
unfortunate
conditions
of
our
race
might
be
ameliorated
by
science

view
that

the
theme
of

is
the
question
of
moral

the
author
inclines
to
the
view
that
the

will
continue
to
improve
even
as
it
has
hitherto
been
continually
improving
and
that
the
progress
of
knowledge
and
the
diffusion
of
christianity
will
bring
about
at
last
when
men
become
christian

reality

state

is
significant

it
must
have
contributed
in
its
day
to

the

moderate
view
of
progress
consistent
with
orthodoxy
which
southey
held
the
belief
of
the
perfectibility
of
human
nature
and
the
attainment
of
a
golden
age
in
which

only
be
entertained
by
an
enthusiast

an
inquiry

the

is

not

by

progress
in

light
of

in
the
sixties
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
idea
of
progress
entered
upon
the
third
period
of
its
history
during
the
first
period
up
to
the
french
revolution
it
had
been
treated
rather
casually
it
was
taken
for
granted
and
received
no
searching
examination
either
from
philosophers
or
from
historians
in
the
second
period
its
immense
significance
was
apprehended
and
a
search
began
for
a
general
law
which
would
define
and
establish
it
the
study
of
sociology
was
founded
and
at
the
same
time
the
impressive
results
of
science
applied
to
the
conveniences
of
life
advertised
the
idea
it
harmonised
with
the
notion
of
development
which
had
become
current
both
in
natural
science
and
in
metaphysics
socialists
and
other
political
reformers
appealed
to
it
as
a
gospel
by
it
was
a
familiar
idea
in
europe
but
was
not
yet
universally
accepted
as
obviously
true
the
notion
of
social
progress
had
been
growing
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
notion
of
biological
development
but
this
development
still
seemed
a
highly
precarious
speculation
the
fixity
of
species
and
the
creation
of
man
defended
by
powerful
interests
and
prejudices
were
attacked
but
were
not
shaken
the
hypothesis
of
organic
evolution
was
much
in
the
same
position
as
the
copernican
hypothesis
in
the
sixteenth
century
then
in
darwin
intervened
like
galileo
the
appearance
of
the
origin
of
species
changed
the
situation
by
disproving
definitely
the
dogma
of
fixity
of
species
and
assigning
real
causes
for
transformism
what
might
be
set
aside
before
as
a
brilliant
guess
was
elevated
to
the
rank
of
a
scientific
hypothesis
and
the
following
twenty
years
were
enlivened
by
the
struggle
around
the
evolution
of
life
against
prejudices
chiefly
theological
resulting
in
the
victory
of
the
theory
the
origin
of
species
led
to
the
third
stage
of
the
fortunes
of
the
idea
of
progress
we
saw
how
the
heliocentric
astronomy
by
dethroning
man
from
his
privileged
position
in
the
universe
of
space
and
throwing
him
back
on
his
own
efforts
had
helped
that
idea
to
compete
with
the
idea
of
a
busy
providence
he
now
suffers
a
new
degradation
within
the
compass
of
his
own
planet
evolution
shearing
him
of
his
glory
as
a
rational
being
specially
created
to
be
the
lord
of
the
earth
traces
a
humble
pedigree
for
him
and
this
second
degradation
was
the
decisive
fact
which
has
established
the
reign
of
the
idea
of
progress
evolution
itself
it
must
be
remembered
does
not
necessarily
mean
applied
to
society
the
movement
of
man
to
a
desirable
goal
it
is
a
neutral
scientific
conception
compatible
either
with
optimism
or
with
pessimism
according
to
different
estimates
it
may
appear
to
be
a
cruel
sentence
or
a
guarantee
of
steady
amelioration
and
it
has
been
actually
interpreted
in
both
ways
in
order
to
base
progress
on
evolution
two
distinct
arguments
are
required
if
it
could
be
shown
that
social
life
obeys
the
same
general
laws
of
evolution
as
nature
and
also
that
the
process
involves
an
increase
of
happiness
then
progress
would
be
as
valid
a
hypothesis
as
the
evolution
of
living
forms
darwin
had
concluded
his
treatise
with
these
words
as
all
the
living
forms
of
life
are
the
lineal
descendants
of
those
which
lived
long
before
the
silurian
epoch
we
may
feel
certain
that
the
ordinary
succession
by
generation
has
never
once
been
broken
and
that
no
cataclysm
has
desolated
the
whole
world
hence
we
may
look
with
some
confidence
to
a
secure
future
of
equally
inappreciable
length
and
as
natural
selection
works
solely
by
and
for
the
good
of
each
being
all
corporeal
and
mental
environments
will
tend
to
progress
towards
perfection
here
the
evolutionist
struck
the
note
of
optimism
and
he
suggested
that
laws
of
progress
would
be
found
in
other
quarters
than
those
where
they
had
hitherto
been
sought
the
ablest
and
most
influential
development
of
the
argument
from
evolution
to
progress
was
the
work
of
spencer
he
extended
the
principle
of
evolution
to
sociology
and
ethics
and
was
the
most
conspicuous
interpreter
of
it
in
an
optimistic
sense
he
had
been
an
evolutionist
long
before
darwin
decisive
intervention
and
in
he
had
published
his
social
statics
which
although
he
had
not
yet
worked
out
the
evolutionary
laws
which
he
began
to
formulate
soon
afterwards
and
was
still
a
theist
exhibits
the
general
trend
of
his
optimistic
philosophy
progress
here
appears
as
the
basis
of
a
theory
of
ethics

the
influence
of

argument
is
sharply

and
the
first
of
them
developed
is
the
full
title
spencer
begins
by
arguing
that
the
constancy
of
human
nature
so
frequently
alleged
is
a
fallacy
for
change
is
the
law
of
all
things
of
every
single
object
as
well
as
of
the
universe
nature
in
its
infinite
complexity
is
ever
growing
to
a
new
development
it
would
be
strange
if
in
this
universal
mutation
man
alone
were
unchangeable
and
it
is
not
true
he
also
obeys
the
law
of
indefinite
variation
contrast
the
houseless
savages
with
newtons
and
shakespeares
between
these
extremes
there
are
countless
degrees
of
difference
if
then
humanity
is
indefinitely
variable
perfectibility
is
possible
in
the
second
place
evil
is
not
a
permanent
necessity
for
all
evil
results
from
the
of
the
organism
to
its
conditions
this
is
true
of
everything
that
lives
and
it
is
equally
true
that
evil
perpetually
tends
to
disappear
in
virtue
of
an
essential
principle
of
life
this
of
organisms
to
their
conditions
is
ever
being
rectified
and
one
or
both
continue
to
be
modified
until
the
adaptation
is
perfect
and
this
applies
to
the
mental
as
well
as
to
the
physical
sphere
in
the
present
state
of
the
world
men
suffer
many
evils
and
this
shows
that
their
characters
are
not
yet
adjusted
to
the
social
state
now
the
qualification
requisite
for
the
social
state
is
that
each
individual
shall
have
such
desires
only
as
may
fully
be
satisfied
without
trenching
upon
the
ability
of
others
to
obtain
similar
satisfaction
this
qualification
is
not
yet
fulfilled
because
civilised
man
retains
some
of
the
characteristics
which
were
suitable
for
the
conditions
of
his
earlier
predatory
life
he
needed
one
moral
constitution
for
his
primitive
state
he
needs
quite
another
for
his
present
state
the
resultant
is
a
process
of
adaptation
which
has
been
going
on
for
a
long
time
and
will
go
on
for
a
long
time
to
come
civilisation
represents
the
adaptations
which
have
already
been
accomplished
progress
means
the
successive
steps
of
the
process
that
by
this
process
man
will
eventually
become
suited
to
his
mode
of
life
spencer
has
no
doubts
all
excess
and
deficiency
of
suitable
faculties
must
disappear
in
other
words
all
imperfection
the
ultimate
development
of
the
ideal
man
is
logically
certain
as
certain
as
any
conclusion
in
which
we
place
the
most
implicit
faith
for
instance
that
all
men
will
die
here
is
the
theory
of
perfectibility
asserted
on
new
grounds
with
a
confidence
not
less
assured
than
that
of
condorcet
or
godwin
progress
then
is
not
an
accident
but
a
necessity
civilisation
is
a
part
of
nature
being
a
development
of
man
latent
capabilities
under
the
action
of
favourable
circumstances
which
were
certain
at
some
time
or
other
to
occur
here
spencer
argument
assumes
a
final
cause
the
ultimate
purpose
of
creation
he
asserts
is
to
produce
the
greatest
amount
of
happiness
and
to
fulfil
this
aim
it
is
necessary
that
each
member
of
the
race
should
possess
faculties
enabling
him
to
experience
the
highest
enjoyment
of
life
yet
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
diminish
the
power
of
others
to
receive
like
satisfaction
beings
thus
constituted
can
not
multiply
in
a
world
tenanted
by
inferior
creatures
these
therefore
must
be
dispossessed
to
make
room
and
to
dispossess
them
aboriginal
man
must
have
an
inferior
constitution
to
begin
with
he
must
be
predatory
he
must
have
the
desire
to
kill
in
general
given
an
unsubdued
earth
and
the
human
being
appointed
to
overspread
and
occupy
it
then
the
laws
of
life
being
what
they
are
no
other
series
of
changes
than
that
which
has
actually
occurred
could
have
occurred
the
argument
might
be
put
in
a
form
free
from
the
assumption
of
a
final
cause
and
without
introducing
the
conception
of
a
divine
providence
which
in
this
work
spencer
adopted
though
in
his
later
philosophy
it
was
superseded
by
the
conception
of
the
unknowable
existing
behind
all
phenomena
but
the
role
of
the
divine
ruler
is
simply
to
set
in
motion
immutable
forces
to
realise
his
design
in
the
moral
as
in
the
material
world
accumulated
evidence
is
gradually
generating
the
conviction
that
events
are
not
at
bottom
fortuitous
but
that
they
are
wrought
out
in
a
certain
inevitable
way
by
unchanging
forces
the
optimism
of
spencer
view
could
not
be
surpassed
after
patient
study
he
writes
this
chaos
of
phenomena
into
the
midst
of
which
he
man
was
born
has
begun
to
generalise
itself
to
him
instead
of
confusion
he
begins
to
discern
the
dim
outlines
of
a
gigantic
plan
no
accidents
no
chance
but
everywhere
order
and
completeness
one
by
one
exceptions
vanish
and
all
becomes
systematic
always
towards
perfection
is
the
mighty
movement
towards
a
complete
development
and
a
more
unmixed
good
subordinating
in
its
universality
all
petty
irregularities
and
fallings
back
as
the
curvature
of
the
earth
subordinates
mountains
and
valleys
even
in
evils
the
student
learns
to
recognise
only
a
struggling
beneficence
but
above
all
he
is
struck
with
the
inherent
sufficingness
of
things
but
the
movement
towards
harmony
the
elimination
of
evil
will
not
be
effected
by
idealists
imposing
their
constructions
upon
the
world
or
by
authoritarian
governments
it
means
gradual
adaptation
gradual
psychological
change
and
its
life
is
individual
liberty
it
proceeds
by
the
give
and
take
of
opposed
opinions
guizot
had
said
progress
and
at
the
same
time
resistance
and
spencer
conceives
that
resistance
is
beneficial
so
long
as
it
comes
from
those
who
honestly
think
that
the
institutions
they
defend
are
really
the
best
and
the
proposed
innovations
absolutely
wrong
it
will
be
observed
that
spencer
doctrine
of
perfectibility
rests
on
an
entirely
different
basis
from
the
doctrine
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
is
one
thing
to
deduce
it
from
an
abstract
psychology
which
holds
that
human
nature
is
unresistingly
plastic
in
the
hands
of
the
legislator
and
the
instructor
it
is
another
to
argue
that
human
nature
is
subject
to
the
general
law
of
change
and
that
the
process
by
which
it
slowly
but
continuously
tends
to
adapt
itself
more
and
more
to
the
conditions
of
social
life
children
inheriting
the
acquired
aptitudes
of
their
parents
points
to
an
ultimate
harmony
here
profitable
legislation
and
education
are
auxiliary
to
the
process
of
unconscious
adaptation
and
respond
to
the
psychological
changes
in
the
community
changes
which
reveal
themselves
in
public
opinion
during
the
following
ten
years
spencer
was
investigating
the
general
laws
of
evolution
and
planning
his
synthetic
philosophy
which
was
to
explain
the
development
of
the
universe
footnote
in
an
article
on
progress
its
law
and
cause
in
the
westminster
review
april
spencer
explained
that
social
progress
rightly
understood
is
not
the
increase
of
material
conveniences
or
widening
freedom
of
action
but
changes
of
structure
in
the
social
organism
which
entail
such
consequences
and
proceeded
to
show
that
the
growth
of
the
individual
organism
and
the
growth
of
civilisation
obey
the
same
law
of
advance
from
homogeneity
to
heterogeneity
of
structure
here
he
used
progress
in
a
neutral
sense
but
recognising
that
a
word
is
required
which
has
no
teleological
implications

adopted
evolution
six
months
later
in
an
article

his
study

spencer
was
indirectly
influenced
by
the
ideas
of
schelling

von

aimed
at
showing
that
laws
of
change
are
discoverable
which
control
all
phenomena
alike
inorganic
biological
psychical
and
social
in
the
light
of
this
hypothesis
the
actual
progression
of
humanity
is
established
as
a
necessary
fact
a
sequel
of
the
general
cosmic
movement
and
governed
by
the
same
principles
and
if
that
progression
is
shown
to
involve
increasing
happiness
the
theory
of
progress
is
established
the
first
section
of
the
work

in
the
biology

psychology

finally
the
sociology
followed
during
the
next
twenty
years
and
the
synthesis
of
the
which
these
volumes
lucidly
and
persuasively
developed
probably
did
more
than
any
other
work
at
least
in
england
both
to
drive
home
the
significance
of
the
doctrine
of
evolution
and
to
raise
the
doctrine
of
progress
to
the
rank
of
a
commonplace
truth
in
popular
estimation
an
axiom
to
which
political
rhetoric
might
effectively
appeal
many
of
those
who
were
allured
by
spencer
gigantic
synthesis
hardly
realised
that
his
theory
of
social
evolution
of
the
gradual
psychical
improvement
of
the
race
depends
upon
the
validity
of
the
assumption
that
parents
transmit
to
their
children
faculties
and
aptitudes
which
they
have
themselves
acquired
on
this
question
experts
notoriously
differ
some
day
it
will
probably
be
definitely
decided
and
perhaps
in
spencer
favour
but
the
theory
of
continuous
psychical
improvement
by
a
process
of
nature
encounters
an
obvious
difficulty
which
did
not
escape
some
critics
of
spencer
in
the
prominent
fact
of
history
that
every
great
civilisation
of
the
past
progressed
to
a
point
at
which
instead
of
advancing
further
it
stood
still
and
declined
to
become
the
prey
of
younger
societies
or
if
it
survived
to
stagnate
arrest
decadence
stagnation
has
been
the
rule
it
is
not
easy
to
reconcile
this
phenomenon
with
the
theory
of
mental
improvement
the
receptive
attitude
of
the
public
towards
such
a
philosophy
as
spencer
had
been
made
possible
by
darwin
discoveries
which
were
reinforced
by
the
growing
science
of
palaeontology
and
the
accumulating
material
evidence
of
the
great
antiquity
of
man

the
simultaneous
advances
of

and
biology
man
perspective
in

was
revolutionised
just
as
the
copernican

revolutionised
his

many
thoughtful
and
many
thoughtless
people
were
ready
to

huxley
suggested
in
man

through
the

a
reasonable
ground
of

in
his
attainment
of
a
nobler

and
winwood
reade
a
young
african
traveller
exhibited
it
in
a
vivid
book
as
a
martyrdom
but
he
was
a
disciple
of
spencer
and
his
hopes
for
the
future
were
as
bright
as
his
picture
of
the
past
was
dark
the
martyrdom
of
man
published
in
was
so
widely
read
that
it
reached
an
eighth
edition
twelve
years
later
and
may
be
counted
as
one
of
the
agencies
which
popularised
optimism
that
optimism
was
not
endorsed
by
all
the
contemporary
leaders
of
thought
lotze
had
asserted
emphatically
in
that
human
nature
will
not
change
and
afterwards
he
saw
no
reason
to
alter
his
conviction
never
one
fold
and
one
shepherd
never
one
uniform
culture
for
all
mankind
never
universal
nobleness
our
virtue
and
happiness
can
only
flourish
amid
an
active
conflict
with
wrong
if
every
were
smoothed
away

would
no

like
a

if

it

to

it
could
be

that

variable
ex

could

that

would

the
consequence
of

very
efforts
to
adapt
himself
every
step
he
takes
to
harmonise
his
needs
and
his
conditions
produces
a
new
discord
and
confronts
him
with
a
new
problem
in
other
words
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
reciprocal
process
which
goes
on
in
the
growth
of
society
between
natures
and
the
environment
they
are
continually
modifying
will
ever
reach
an
equilibrium

as

changes
the
suffering
which
they
cause
diminishes
in

upon
the
neutral
fact
of
evolution
a
theory
of
pessimism
may
be
built
up
as
speciously
as
a
theory
of
optimism
and
such
a
theory
was
built
up
with
great
power
and
ability
by
the
german
philosopher
von
hartmann
whose
philosophy
of
the
unconscious
appeared
in
leaving
aside
his
metaphysics
and
his
grotesque
theory
of
the
destiny
of
the
universe
we
see
here
and
in
his
subsequent
works
how
plausibly
a
convinced
evolutionist
could
revive
the
view
of
rousseau
that
civilisation
and
happiness
are
mutually
antagonistic
and
that
progress
means
an
increase
of
misery

exclusively
from

not
from

i
have
quoted
these
views
to
illustrate
that
evolution
lends
itself
to
a
pessimistic
as
well
as
to
an
optimistic
interpretation
the
question
whether
it
leads
in
a
desirable
direction
or
not
is
answered
according
to
the
temperament
of
the
inquirer
in
an
age
of
prosperity
and
the
affirmative
answer
was
readily
received
and
the
term
evolution
attracted
to
itself
in
common
speech
the
implications
of
value
which
belong
to
progress
it
may
be
noticed
that
the
of
the
age
was
promoted
by
the
popularisation
of
scientific
knowledge
a
rapidly
growing
demand
especially
in
england
for
books
and
lectures
making
the
results
of
science
accessible
and
interesting
to
the
lay
public
is
a
remarkable
feature
of
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
to
supply
this
demand
was
a
remunerative
enterprise
this
popular
literature
explaining
the
wonders
of
the
physical
world
was
at
the
same
time
subtly
flushing
the
imaginations
of
men
with
the
consciousness
that
they
were
living
in
an
era
which
in
itself
vastly
superior
to
any
age
of
the
past
need
be
burdened
by
no
fear
of
decline
or
catastrophe
but
trusting
in
the
boundless
resources
of
science
might
securely
defy
fate
it
was
said
in
by
an
american
writer
who
strongly
dissented
from
spencer
theory
that
the
current
view
was
fatalistic
see

but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
those
of
the
general
public
who
optimistically
accepted

without
going
very
deeply
into
the
question
really
believed
that
the

for
him
the
fundamental
characteristic
of
social
progress
is
the
continuous
weakening
of
selfishness
and
the
continuous
strengthening
of
sympathy
thus
in
the
seventies
and
eighties
of
the
last
century
the
idea
of
progress
was
becoming
a
general
article
of
faith
some
might
hold
it
in
the
fatalistic
form
that
humanity
moves
in
a
desirable
direction
whatever
men
do
or
may
leave
undone
others
might
believe
that
the
future
will
depend
largely
on
our
own
conscious
efforts
but
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
nature
of
things
to
disappoint
the
prospect
of
steady
and
indefinite
advance
the
majority
did
not
inquire
too
curiously
into
such
points
of
doctrine
but
received
it
in
a
vague
sense
as
a
comfortable
addition
to
their
convictions
but
it
became
a
part
of
the
general
mental
outlook
of
educated
people
when
frederic
harrison
delivered
in
at
manchester
an
eloquent
discourse
on
the
new
era
in
which
the
dominant
note
is
the
faith
in
human
progress
in
lieu
of
celestial
rewards
of
the
separate
soul
his
general
argument
could
appeal
to
immensely
wider
circles
than
the
positivists
whom
he
was
specially
addressing
the
dogma
for
a
dogma
it
remains
in
spite
of
the
confidence
of
comte
or
of
spencer
that
he
had
made
it
a
scientific
hypothesis
has
produced
an
important
ethical
principle
consideration
for
posterity
has
throughout
history
operated
as
a
motive
of
conduct
but
feebly
occasionally
and
in
a
very
limited
sense
with
the
doctrine
of
progress
it
assumes
logically
a
preponderating
importance
for
the
centre
of
interest
is
transferred
to
the
life
of
future
generations
who
are
to
enjoy
conditions
of
happiness
denied
to
us
but
which
our
labours
and
sufferings
are
to
help
to
bring
about
if
the
doctrine
is
held
in
an
extreme
fatalistic
form
then
our
duty
is
to
resign
ourselves
cheerfully
to
sacrifices
for
the
sake
of
unknown
descendants
just
as
ordinary
altruism
enjoins
the
cheerful
acceptance
of
sacrifices
for
the
sake
of
living
winwood
reade
indicated
this
when
he
wrote
our
own
prosperity
is
founded
on
the
agonies
of
the
past
is
it
therefore
unjust
that
we
also
should
suffer
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
to
come
but
if
it
is
held
that
each
generation
can
by
its
own
deliberate
acts
determine
for
good
or
evil
the
destinies
of
the
race
then
our
duties
towards
others
reach
out
through
time
as
well
as
through
space
and
our
contemporaries
are
only
a
negligible
fraction
of
the
neighbours
to
whom
we
owe
obligations
the
ethical
end
may
still
be
formulated
with
the
utilitarians
as
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
only
the
greatest
number
includes
as
kidd
observed
the
members
of
generations
yet
unborn
or
unthought
of
this
extension
of
the
moral
code
if
it
is
not
yet
conspicuous
in
treatises
on
ethics
has
in
late
years
been
obtaining
recognition
in
practice
within
the
last
forty
years
nearly
every
civilised
country
has
produced
a
large
literature
on
social
science
in
which
indefinite
progress
is
generally
assumed
as
an
axiom
but
the
law
whose
investigation
kant
designated
as
the
task
for
a
newton
which
and
comte
did
not
find
and
to
which
spencer
evolutionary
formula
would
stand
in
the
same
relation
as
it
stands
to
the
law
of
gravitation
remains
still
undiscovered
to
examine
or
even
glance
at
this
literature
or
to
speculate
how
theories
of
progress
may
be
modified
by
recent
philosophical
speculation
lies
beyond
the
scope
of
this
volume
which
is
only
concerned
with
tracing
the
origin
of
the
idea
and
its
growth
up
to
the
time
when
it
became
a
current
creed
looking
back
on
the
course
of
the
inquiry
we
note
how
the
history
of
the
idea
has
been
connected
with
the
growth
of
modern
science
with
the
growth
of
rationalism
and
with
the
struggle
for
political
and
religious
liberty
the
precursors
bodin
and
bacon
lived
at
a
time
when
the
world
was
consciously
emancipating
itself
from
the
authority
of
tradition
and
it
was
being
discovered
that
liberty
is
a
difficult
theoretical
problem
the
idea
took
definite
shape
in
france
when
the
old
scheme
of
the
universe
had
been
shattered
by
the
victory
of
the
new
astronomy
and
the
prestige
of
providence
cuncta
supercilio
mouentis
was
paling
before
the
majesty
of
the
immutable
laws
of
nature
there
began
a
slow
but
steady
reinstatement
of
the
kingdom
of
this
world
the
otherworldly
dreams
of
theologians
ceux
qui
reniaient
la
terre
pour
patrie
which
had
ruled
so
long
lost
their
power
and
men
earthly
home
again
insinuated
itself
into
their
affections
but
with
the
new
hope
of
its
becoming
a
place
fit
for
reasonable
beings
to
live
in
we
have
seen
how
the
belief
that
our
race
is
travelling
towards
earthly
happiness
was
propagated
by
some
eminent
thinkers
as
well
as
by
some
not
very
fortunate
persons
who
had
a
good
deal
of
time
on
their
hands
and
all
these
and
to
whom
the
creed
owes
its
success
were
rationalists
from
the
author
of
the
histoire
des
oracles
to
the
philosopher
of
the
unknowable
epilogue
in
achieving
its
ascendency
and
unfolding
its
meaning
the
idea
of
progress
had
to
overcome
a
psychological
obstacle
which
may
be
described
as
the
illusion
of
finality
it
is
quite
easy
to
fancy
a
state
of
society
vastly
different
from
ours
existing
in
some
unknown
place
like
heaven
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
realise
as
a
fact
that
the
order
of
things
with
which
we
are
familiar
has
so
little
stability
that
our
actual
descendants
may
be
born
into
a
world
as
different
from
ours
as
ours
is
from
that
of
our
ancestors
of
the
pleistocene
age
the
illusion
of
finality
is
strong
the
men
of
the
middle
ages
would
have
found
it
hard
to
imagine
that
a
time
was
not
far
off
in
which
the
last
judgement
would
have
ceased
to
arouse
any
emotional
interest
in
the
sphere
of
speculation
hegel
and
even
comte
illustrate
this
psychological
limitation
they
did
not
recognise
that
their
own
systems
could
not
be
final
any
more
than
the
system
of
aristotle
or
of
descartes
it
is
science
perhaps
more
than
anything
else
the
wonderful
history
of
science
in
the
last
hundred
years
that
has
helped
us
to
transcend
this
illusion
but
if
we
accept
the
reasonings
on
which
the
dogma
of
progress
is
based
must
we
not
carry
them
to
their
full
conclusion
in
escaping
from
the
illusion
of
finality
is
it
legitimate
to
exempt
that
dogma
itself
must
not
it
too
submit
to
its
own
negation
of
finality
will
not
that
process
of
change
for
which
progress
is
the
optimistic
name
compel
progress
too
to
fall
from
the
commanding
position
in
which
it
is
now
with
apparent
security
enthroned
words
in
greek
a
day
will
come
in
the
revolution
of
centuries
when
a
new
idea
will
usurp
its
place
as
the
directing
idea
of
humanity
another
star
unnoticed
now
or
invisible
will
climb
up
the
intellectual
heaven
and
human
emotions
will
react
to
its
influence
human
plans
respond
to
its
guidance
it
will
be
the
criterion
by
which
progress
and
all
other
ideas
will
be
judged
and
it
too
will
have
its
successor
in
other
words
does
not
progress
itself
suggest
that
its
value
as
a
doctrine
is
only
relative
corresponding
to
a
certain
not
very
advanced
stage
of
civilisation
just
as
providence
in
its
day
was
an
idea
of
relative
value
corresponding
to
a
stage
somewhat
less
advanced
or
will
it
be
said
that
this
argument
is
merely
a
disconcerting
trick
of
dialectic
played
under
cover
of
the
darkness
in
which
the
issue
of
the
future
is
safely
hidden
by
horace
prudent
god
