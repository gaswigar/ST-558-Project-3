to
old
friends
with
young
hearts
and
young
hearts
growing
old
dear
friends
of
our
youth
should
you
happen
to
look
at
the
curious
things
in
this
curious
book
and
should
you
with
quizzical
countenance
ask
the
how
and
the
why
of
our
curious
task
we
could
truly
reply
to
the
query
of
why
to
the
smile
on
your
lip
and
your
questioning
eye
that
the
work
was
begun
in
a
spirit
of
fun
to
amuse
when
the
work
of
the
daylight
was
done
and
continued
because
we
believed
it
would
be
amusement
to
such
as
were
weary
as
we
to
drift
for
awhile
among
goblins
and
elves
or
haply
make
shadows
and
rhymes
for
themselves
for
though
years
have
passed
since
we
drifted
apart
we
all
of
us
more
or
less
children
at
heart
and
maybe
yourselves
and
the
youngsters
will
please
to
dwell
for
an
hour
with
such
creatures
as
these
illustration
illustration
now
some
one
has
said
in
a
moment
of
spleen
we
can
not
make
pictures
of
what
we
not
seen
but
such
an
assertion
deserves
only
scorn
for
the
shape
of
the
gobolink
never
was
born
he
comes
like
the
marvelous
mimes
of
our
dreams
when
one
has
been
supping
on
salads
and
creams
and
curious
changes
of
vision
take
place
the
horse
may
appear
with
an
elephant
face
the
goat
with
a
cane
and
the
goose
with
a
hat
six
legs
on
the
dog
and
two
tails
on
the
cat
we
never
can
tell
though
we
sorely
perplexed
what
shape
will
be
shown
us
or
what
will
come
next
and
these
are
the
things
that
our
gobolinks
do
dear
friends
and
dear
children
we
give
them
to
you
illustration
the
gobolink
and
how
to
make
him
illustration
drop
a
little
ink
on
a
sheet
of
white
paper
fold
the
sheet
in
the
center
and
press
the
together
with
the
fingers
all
of
the
pictures
in
this
book
were
made
in
this
manner
none
of
them
having
been
touched
with
a
pen
or
brush
a
great
deal
of
practice
will
only
go
to
show
that
the
gobolink
as
his
name
implies
is
a
veritable
goblin
of
the
and
the
way
he
eludes
the
artist
design
proves
him
a
eccentric
creature
of
a
superior
imagination
it
is
hardly
to
be
expected
that
the
animals
and
birds
of
prey
referred
to
under
more
or
less
familiar
names
in
the
accompanying
rhymes
will
be
strikingly
correct
as
to
anatomy
and
because
as
upon
page
the
elephants
or
whatever
they
may
be
happen
to
have
each
a
row
of
interesting
tails
continuing
along
the
full
length
of
the
spinal
column
no
unkind
criticism
should
be
made
upon
the
ability
of
the
overworked
and
conscientious
artists
who
would
have
made
fewer
tails
if
they
could
and
have
added
nothing
to
the
price
of
the
book
on
account
of
undue
liberality
in
the
matter
of
caudal
appendages
illustration
in
fact
the
most
unexpected
and
startling
results
will
often
occur
results
grotesquely
and
strangely
beautiful
well
worthy
of
preservation
the
authors
of
this
book
will
be
glad
to
receive
a
few
examples
of
some
of
the
more
unusual
gobolinks
or
that
may
occur
to
those
interested
in
the
amusement
they
may
be
sent
care
of
the
century
co
the
game
of
gobolink
persons
of
all
ages
may
obtain
amusement
out
of
gobolinks
or
as
they
are
also
called
illustration
the
following
is
a
very
good
method
for
playing
the
game
let
three
of
the
company
be
selected
by
the
hostess
as
judges
to
each
of
the
others
she
then
distributes
from
five
to
ten
sheets
of
paper
from
which
they
must
produce
at
least
one
completed
picture
and
rhyme
in
a
given
length
of
time
say
five
minutes
at
the
end
of
which
the
hostess
rings
a
bell
and
the
judges
proceed
at
once
to
take
up
the
pictures
these
are
then
passed
upon
by
them
while
the
hostess
is
distributing
a
fresh
round
of
paper
and
the
best
two
and
the
worst
one
are
laid
aside
those
whose
pictures
have
been
selected
now
act
as
judges
surrendering
their
places
at
the
tables
to
their
predecessors
and
another
lot
of
pictures
and
rhymes
are
made
the
game
is
continued
in
this
manner
until
the
hostess
announces
the
arrival
of
the
time
for
final
judgment
or
until
a
certain
hour
specified
in
the
beginning
illustration
the
three
judges
then
in
office
now
select
one
of
the
company
as
reader
and
such
person
selected
shall
take
up
his
position
in
strong
light
and
after
reading
the
verses
on
each
picture
shall
display
it
in
full
view
of
all
present
it
should
then
be
pinned
to
a
suspended
sheet
or
screen
where
it
may
be
easily
examined
by
the
company
this
shall
be
continued
until
all
the
pictures
selected
by
the
judges
have
been
so
treated
and
displayed
the
reader
then
acts
as
chairman
and
the
company
proceed
to
vote
on
them
for
first
second
and
booby
prizes
the
gobolink
receiving
second
largest
number
of
votes
for
first
prize
is
awarded
second
the
ballot
for
booby
should
be
of
course
taken
separately
pictures
should
be
signed
or
otherwise
identified
illustration
where
a
number
are
making
the
pictures
it
is
well
to
seat
them
around
a
large
table
with
the
in
the
center
ink
should
be
used
and
a
good
quality
of
unglazed
paper
the
ink
should
not
be
too
thin
the
table
should
be
protected
from
accident
with
several
thicknesses
of
newspaper
a
filled
pen
or
may
be
used
for
supplying
the
ink
for
a
specially
invited
gobolink
party
the
company
may
dress
in
any
grotesque
fashion
remembering
only
that
both
sides
of
their
costume
shall
be
the
same
this
being
a
feature
peculiar
to
gobolink
attire
no
game
could
be
more
productive
of
amusement
