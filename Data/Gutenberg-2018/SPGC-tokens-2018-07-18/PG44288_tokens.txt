blue
beard
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
man
who
had
fine
town
and
country
houses
gold
and
silver
plate
embroidered
furniture
and
coaches
gilt
all
over
but
unfortunately
this
man
had
a
blue
beard
which
made
him
look
so
ugly
and
terrible
that
there
was
not
a
woman
or
girl
who
did
not
run
away
from
him
one
of
his
neighbours
a
lady
of
quality
had
two
daughters
who
were
perfectly
beautiful
he
proposed
to
marry
one
of
them
leaving
her
to
choose
which
of
the
two
she
would
give
him
neither
of
them
would
have
him
and
they
sent
him
from
one
to
the
other
not
being
able
to
make
up
their
minds
to
marry
a
man
who
had
a
blue
beard
what
increased
their
distaste
to
him
was
that
he
had
had
several
wives
already
and
nobody
knew
what
had
become
of
them
blue
beard
in
order
to
cultivate
their
acquaintance
took
them
with
their
mother
three
or
four
of
their
most
intimate
friends
and
some
young
persons
who
resided
in
the
neighbourhood
to
one
of
his
country
seats
where
they
passed
an
entire
week
nothing
was
thought
of
but
excursions
hunting
and
fishing
parties
balls
entertainments
collations
nobody
went
to
bed
the
whole
night
was
spent
in
merry
games
and
gambols
in
short
all
went
off
so
well
that
the
youngest
daughter
began
to
find
out
that
the
beard
of
the
master
of
the
house
was
not
as
blue
as
it
used
to
be
and
that
he
was
a
very
worthy
man
immediately
upon
their
return
to
town
the
marriage
took
place
illustration
his
beard
seemed
not
so
very
blue
at
the
end
of
a
month
blue
beard
told
his
wife
that
he
was
obliged
to
take
a
journey
which
would
occupy
six
weeks
at
least
on
a
matter
of
great
consequence
that
he
entreated
she
would
amuse
herself
as
much
as
she
could
during
his
absence
that
she
would
invite
her
best
friends
take
them
into
the
country
with
her
if
she
pleased
and
keep
an
excellent
table
everywhere
here
said
he
to
her
are
the
keys
of
my
two
great
these
are
those
of
the
chests
in
which
the
gold
and
silver
plate
is
kept
that
is
only
used
on
particular
occasions
these
are
the
keys
of
the
strong
boxes
in
which
i
keep
my
money
these
open
the
caskets
that
contain
my
jewels
and
this
is
the
of
all
the
apartments
as
for
this
little
key
it
is
that
of
the
closet
at
the
end
of
the
long
gallery
on
the
ground
floor
open
everything
and
go
everywhere
except
into
that
little
closet
which
i
forbid
you
to
enter
and
i
forbid
you
so
strictly
that
if
you
should
venture
to
open
the
door
there
is
nothing
that
you
may
not
have
to
dread
from
my
anger
she
promised
to
observe
implicitly
all
his
directions
and
after
he
had
embraced
her
he
got
on
to
his
horse
and
set
out
on
his
journey
the
neighbours
and
friends
of
the
young
bride
did
not
wait
for
her
invitation
so
eager
were
they
to
see
all
the
treasures
contained
in
the
mansion
not
having
ventured
to
enter
it
while
the
husband
was
at
home
so
terrified
were
they
at
his
blue
beard

departure
of
behold
them
immediately
running
through
all
the
rooms
closets
and
wardrobes
each
apartment
exceeding
the
other
in
beauty
and
richness
illustration
her
friends
did
not
wait
to
be
invited
they
ascended
afterwards
to
the
where
they
could
not
sufficiently
admire
the
number
and
elegance
of
the
tapestries
the
beds
the
sofas
the
cabinets
the
stands
the
tables
and
the
mirrors
in
which
they
could
see
themselves
from
head
to
foot
and
that
had
frames
some
of
glass
some
of
silver
and
some
of
gilt
metal
more
beautiful
and
magnificent
than
had
ever
been
seen
they
never
ceased
enlarging
upon
and
envying
the
good
fortune
of
their
friend
who
in
the
meanwhile
was
not
in
the
least
entertained
by
the
sight
of
all
these
treasures
in
consequence
of
her
impatience
to
open
the
closet
on
the
ground
floor
her
curiosity
increased
to
such
a
degree
that
without
reflecting
how
rude
it
was
to
leave
her
company
she
ran
down
a
back
staircase
in
such
haste
that
twice
or
thrice
she
narrowly
escaped
breaking
her
neck
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
closet
she
paused
for
a
moment
bethinking
herself
of
her
husband
prohibition
and
that
some
misfortune
might
befall
her
for
her
disobedience
but
the
temptation
was
so
strong
that
she
could
not
conquer
it
illustration
she
paused
before
unlocking
the
door
she
therefore
took
the
little
key
and
opened
tremblingly
the
door
of
the
closet
at
first
she
could
discern
nothing
the
windows
being
closed
after
a
short
time
she
began
to
perceive
that
the
floor
was
all
covered
with
clotted
blood
in
which
were
reflected
the
dead
bodies
of
several
females
suspended
against
the
walls
these
were
all
the
wives
of
blue
beard
who
had
cut
their
throats
one
after
the
other
she
was
ready
to
die
with
fright
and
the
key
of
the
closet
which
she
had
withdrawn
from
the
lock
fell
from
her
hand
after
recovering
her
senses
a
little
she
picked
up
the
key
locked
the
door
again
and
went
up
to
her
chamber
to
compose
herself
but
she
could
not
succeed
so
greatly
was
she
agitated
having
observed
that
the
key
of
the
closet
was
stained
with
blood
she
wiped
it
two
or
three
times
but
the
blood
would
not
come
off
in
vain
she
washed
it
and
even
scrubbed
it
with
sand
and
freestone
the
blood
was
still
there
for
the
key
was
enchanted
and
there
were
no
means
of
cleaning
it
completely
when
the
blood
was
washed
off
one
side
it
came
back
on
the
other

blue
beard
returned
that
very
evening
and
said
that
he
had
received
letters
on
the
road
informing
him
that
the
business
on
which
he
was
going
had
been
settled
to
his
advantage
his
wife
did
all
she
could
to
persuade
him
that
she
was
delighted
at
his
speedy
return
the
next
morning
he
asked
her
for
his
keys
again
she
gave
them
to
him
but
her
hand
trembled
so
that
he
had
not
much
difficulty
in
guessing
what
had
occurred
how
comes
it
said
he
that
the
key
of
the
closet
is
not
with
the
others
i
must
have
left
it
she
replied
on
my
table
fail
not
said
blue
beard
to
give
it
me
presently
after
several
excuses
she
was
compelled
to
produce
the
key
blue
beard
having
examined
it
said
to
his
wife
why
is
there
some
blood
on
this
key
i
do
know
answered
the
poor
wife
paler
than
death
you
know
rejoined
blue
beard
i
know
well
enough
illustration
you
do
not
know
i
very
well
know
you
must
needs
enter
the
closet
well
madam
you
shall
enter
it
and
go
take
your
place
amongst
the
ladies
you
saw
there
she
flung
herself
at
her
husband
feet
weeping
and
begging
his
pardon
with
all
the
signs
of
true
repentance
for
having
disobeyed
him
her
beauty
and
affliction
might
have
melted
a
rock
but
blue
beard
had
a
heart
harder
than
a
rock
you
must
die
madam
said
he
and
immediately
if
i
must
die
she
replied
looking
at
him
with
streaming
eyes
give
me
a
little
time
to
say
my
prayers
i
give
you
half
a
quarter
of
an
hour
answered
blue
beard
but
not
a
minute
more
as
soon
as
he
had
left
her
she
called
her
sister
and
said
to
her
sister
anne
for
so
she
was
named
go

i
pray
thee
to
the
top
of
the
tower
and
see
if
my
brothers
are
not
coming
they
have
promised
me
that
they
would
come
to
see
me
today
and
if
you
see
them
sign
to
them
to
make
haste
sister
anne
mounted
to
the
top
of
the
tower
and
the
poor
distressed
creature
called
to
her
every
now
and
then
anne
sister
anne
dost

not

and
sister
anne
answered
her
i

but
the
sun
making

and
the
grass
growing
green

i
see
only
the
sun
and
dust
in
the
meanwhile
blue
beard
with
a
great
cutlass
in
his
hand
called
out
with
all
his
might
to
his
wife
come
down
quickly
or
i
will
come
up
there
one
minute
more
if
you
please
replied
his
wife
and
immediately
repeated
in
a
low
voice
anne
sister
anne
dost
thou
not
see
anything
coming
and
sister
anne
replied
i
see
nothing
but
the
sun
making

and
the
grass
growing
green
come
down
quickly
roared
blue
beard
or
i
will

answered
his
wife
and
then
exclaimed
anne
sister
anne
dost
thou
not
see
anything
coming
i

said
sister
anne
a
great
cloud

sister
i
see
a
flock
of
sheep

shouted
blue
beard
one
minute
more
replied
his
wife
and
then
she
cried
anne
sister
anne
dost
thou
not
see
anything
coming
i
see
she
replied
two
horsemen
coming
this
way
but
they
are
still
at
a
great
distance
heaven
be
praised
she
exclaimed
a
moment
afterwards
they
are
my
brothers
i
am
making
all
the
signs
i
can
to
hasten
them
blue
beard
began
to
roar
so
loudly
that
the
whole
house
shook
again
the
poor
wife
descended
and
went
and
threw
herself
with
streaming
eyes
and
dishevelled
tresses
at
his
feet
it
is
of
no
use
said
blue
beard
you
must
die
then
seizing
her
by
the
hair
with
one
hand
and
raising
his
cutlass
with
the
other
he
was
about
to
cut
off
her
head
the
poor
wife
turned
towards
him
and
fixing
upon
him
her
dying
eyes
implored
him
to
allow
her
one
short
moment
to
collect
herself
no
no
said
he
recommend
thyself
heartily
to
heaven
and
lifting
his
arm
at
this
moment
there
was
so
loud
a
knocking
at
the
gate
that
blue
beard
stopped
short
it
was
opened
and
two
horsemen
were
immediately
seen
to
enter
who
drawing
their
swords
ran
straight
at
blue
beard
he
recognized
them
as
the
brothers
of
his
wife
one
a
dragoon
the
other
a
musqueteer
and
consequently
fled
immediately
in
hope
to
escape
but
they
pursued
him
so
closely
that
they
overtook
him
before
he
could
reach
the
step
of
his
door
and
passing
their
swords
through
his
body
left
him
dead
on
the
spot
the
poor
wife
was
almost
as
dead
as
her
husband
and
had
not
strength
to
rise
and
embrace
her
brothers
illustration
death
of
it
was
found
that
blue
beard
had
no
heirs
and
so
his
widow
remained
possessed
of
all
his
property
she
employed
part
of
it
in
marrying
her
sister
anne
to
a
young
gentleman
who
had
long
loved
her
another
part
in
buying
captains
commissions
for
her
two
brothers
and
with
the
rest
she
married
herself
to
a
very
worthy
man
who
made
her
forget
the
miserable
time
she
had
passed
with
blue
beard
provided
one
has
common
sense
and
of
the
world
but
knows
the
ways
this
story
bears
the
evidence
of
being
one
of
no
husband
now
is
so
terrific
impossibilities

though
jealous
he
is
still
pacific
indifference
to
his
wife

of
his
