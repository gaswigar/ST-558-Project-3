lord
tedric
edward
smith
ph
by
time
is
the
strangest
of
all
mysteries
relatively
unimportant
events
almost
unnoticed
as
they
occur
may
in
hundreds
of
years
result
in
ultimate
catastrophe
on
time
track
number
one
that
was
the
immutable
result
but
on
time
track
number
two
there
was
one
little
event
that
could
be
used
to
avert
it
the
presence
of
a
naked
woman
in
public
so
skandos
one
removed
the
clothing
from
the
lady
rhoann
and
after
one
look
lord
tedric
did
the
rest
one
the
skandos
of
time
track
number
one
numbered
for
reasons
which
will
become
clear
showed
by
means
of
the
chronoviagraph
that
civilization
would
destroy
itself
in
one
hundred
years
to
prevent
this
catastrophe
he
went
back
to
the
key
point
in
time
and
sought
out
the
key
figure
one
tedric
a
lomarrian
ironmaster
who
had
lived
and
died
a
commoner
unable
ever
to
do
anything
about
his
fanatical
detestation
of
human
one
taught
tedric
how
to
make
one
batch
of
watched
him
forge
armor
and
arms
from
that
highly
anachronistic
alloy
he
watched
him
do
things
that
tedric
of
time
track
one
had
never
did
time
track
one
was
probably
no
longer
in
existence
he
must
have
been
saved
by
his
traction
on
the
reality
of
time
track
two
he
snap
back
up
to
his
own
time
and
see
what
the
situation
was
if
he
found
his
assistant
furmin
alone
in
the
laboratory
the
extremists
would
have
been
proved
wrong
if
not
was
not
alone
instead
skandos
two
and
furmin
two
were
at
work
on
a
of
tedric
life
so
like
and
yet
so
wildly
unlike
the
one
upon
which
skandos
one
and
furmin
one
had
labored
so
long
and
undecided
skandos
one
held
his
machine
at
the
very
verge
of
invisibility
and
watched
and
but
it
so
maddeningly
incomplete
skandos
two
snorted
when
it
goes
into
such
fine
detail
on
almost
everything
else
why
ca
we
get
how
he
stumbled
onto
one
lot
and
never
any
other
of
steel
steel
to
be
specific
which
was
rediscovered
for
thousands
of
years
why
it
was
revealed
to
him
by
his
personal
god
llosir
do
you
remember
furmin
poppycock
to
us
yes
but
not
to
them
hence
no
detail
and
you
know
why
we
ca
go
back
and
check
of
course
we
simply
do
know
enough
about
time
but
i
would
so
like
to
study
this
lord
of
the
marches
at
first
hand
nowhere
else
in
all
reachable
time
does
any
other
one
entity
occupy
such
a
uniquely
key
position
so
would
i
chief
if
we
knew
just
little
i
say
go
in
the
meantime
let
run
that
again
to
see
if
we
overlooked
any
little
thing
the
projection
armsmaster
lord
tedric
destroyed
the
principal
images
of
the
monstrous
god
sarpedion
and
killed
sarpedion
priests
he
rescued
lady
rhoann
king
eldest
daughter
from
the
sacrificial
altar
the
king
made
him
lord
of
the
marches
the
highest
of
the
this
part
i
like
furmin
pressed
a
stud
the
projector
stopped
a
armored
giant
and
a
naked
woman
stood
arms
around
each
other
beside
a
altar
of
green
stone
talk
about
being
stacked
if
i
had
checked
the
data
myself
i
swear
you
went
overboard
there
chief
exact
likenesses
life
size
skandos
two
grunted
tedric
muscled
just
like
that
rhoann
six
feet
and
half
an
inch
the
only
time
she
ever
appeared
in
the
raw
in
public
i
guess
but
she
did
turn
a
hair
what
a
couple
furmin
stared
enviously
we
do
have
people
like
that
any
more
fortunately
no
he
could
split
a
man
in
two
with
a
sword
she
could
strangle
a
tiger
so
what
all
the
brains
of
the
whole
damned
tribe
boiled
down
into
one
would
equip
a
oh
i
would
say
that
furmin
objected
phagon
was
a
smooth
shrewd
operator
in
a
way
sometimes
but
committing
suicide
by
wearing
gold
armor
instead
of
steel
does
show
much
i
not
sure
i
buy
that
either
there
were
terrific
pressures
but
say
phagon
had
worn
steel
that
day
at
middlemarch
castle
and
lived
ten
or
fifteen
years
longer
my
guess
is
that
tedric
would
have
changed
the
map
of
the
world
he
was
stupid
you
know
just
and
phagon
could
handle
him
he
would
have
pounded
a
lot
of
sense
into
his
skull
if
he
had
lived
however
he
did
live
skandos
returned
dryly
and
so
every
decision
tedric
ever
made
was
wrong
but
to
get
back
to
the
point
did
you
see
anything
new
not
a
thing
neither
did
i
so
go
and
see
how
eight
twelve
is
doing
time
test
number
eight
hundred
eleven
had
failed
and
there
was
little
ground
for
hope
that
number
eight
hundred
twelve
would
be
any
more
the
lurking
skandos
one
who
had
been
studying
intensively
every
aspect
of
the
situation
began
to
act
it
was
crystal
clear
that
time
track
two
could
hold
only
one
skandos
one
of
them
would
have
to
vanish
completely
immediately
and
permanently
although
in
no
sense
a
killer
by
instinct
or
training
only
one
course
of
action
was
possible
if
his
own
life
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
civilization
were
to
be
conserved
wherefore
he
synchronized
and
shot
his
unsuspecting
double
neatly
through
the
head
the
living
skandos
changed
places
with
the
dead
a
timer
buzzed
briefly
the
disappeared
completely
out
of
synchronization
with
any
continuum
that
a
world
keenest
brain
and
an
calculator
could
would
of
course
make
another
fork
in
time
but
that
fact
did
not
bother
skandos
one
at
all
now
as
for
tedric
since
the
big
dumb
lug
could
be
made
to
believe
that
he
skandos
one
was
other
than
a
god
be
god
in
spades
build
an
image
of
plastic
exactly
like
the
copper
statue
tedric
had
made
and
go
back
and
announce
himself
publicly
as
the
god
llosir
he
come
back
along
three
of
course
and
do
away
with
skandos
three
there
might
have
to
be
another
interference
too
to
get
tedric
started
along
the
right
he
could
tell
better
after
seeing
what
three
looked
like
if
so
it
would
necessitate
the
displacement
of
skandos
what
he
had
never
had
any
qualms
and
now
that
he
had
done
it
once
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
as
to
his
ability
to
do
it
twice
of
the
three
standing
beside
sarpedion
grisly
altar
king
phagon
was
the
first
to
become
conscious
of
the
fact
that
something
should
be
done
about
his
daughter
nudity
flasnir
your
cloak
he
ordered
sharply
and
the
lady
rhoann
unclamping
her
arms
from
around
tedric
armored
neck
and
disengaging
his
arm
from
around
her
waist
covered
herself
with
the
proffered
garment
partially
covered
that
is
for
since
the
cloak
had
come
only
to
on
the
courtier
and
since
she
was
a
good
seven
inches
taller
than
he
the
coverage
might
have
seemed
to
a
prudish
eye
something
less
than
adequate
chamberlain
schillan
captain
sciro
the
king
went
on
briskly
haul
me
this
carrion
to
the
river
and
dump
it
in
put
men
to
cleaning
this
place
is
not
seemly
so
the
designated
officers
began
to
bawl
orders
and
tedric
turned
to
the
girl
who
was
still
just
about
as
close
to
him
as
she
could
get
awe
wonder
and
relieved
shock
still
plain
on
her
expressive
face
one
thing
lady
rhoann
i
understand
not
you
seem
to
know
me
act
as
though
i
were
an
old
tried
friend
is
vast
honor
but
how
you
of
course
i
know
have
known
and
honored
since
you
were
a
child
but
me
a
commoner
you
know
not
nor
if
you
did
couldst
know
who
it
was
neath
all
this
iron
art
wrong
lord
tedric
nay
not
tedric
henceforth
you
and
i
are
tedric
and
rhoann
merely
i
have
known
you
long
and
well
would
recognize
you
anywhere
the
few
of
the
old
true
blood
stand
out
head
and
shoulders
above
the
throng
and
you
stand
out
even
among
them
who
else
could
it
have
been
who
else
hath
the
strength
of
arm
and
soul
the
inner
and
the
outer
courage
no
coward
i
tedric
nor
ever
called
so
but
on
that
altar
my
very
bones
turned
jelly
i
could
not
have
swung
weapon
against
sarpedion
i
tremble
yet
at
the
bare
thought
of
what
you
did
i
know
not
how
you
could
have
done
it
you
feared
the
god
lady
rhoann
as
do
so
many
i
hated
him
is
not
enough
of
explanation
and
merely
tedric
remember
rhoann
thanks
my
lady
is
an
honor
more
real
than
your
father
patent
of
nobility
but
is
not
fitting
i
feel
as
much
a
commoner
commoner
bah
i
ignored
that
word
once
tedric
but
not
twice
you
are
and
deservedly
the
highest
of
the
high
my
father
the
king
has
known
for
long
what
you
are
he
should
have
ennobled
you
long
since
thank
sarp
thank
all
the
gods
he
had
the
wit
to
put
it
off
no
longer
is
blood
that
tells
not
empty
titles
the
throne
can
make
and
unmake
nobility
at
will
but
no
power
whatever
can
make
out
of
mongrels
nor
create
real
where
none
exists
tedric
did
not
know
what
to
say
in
answer
to
that
passionate
outburst
so
he
changed
the
subject
effectively
if
not
deftly
in
speaking
of
the
marches
to
your
father
the
king
you
mentioned
the
sages
what
said
they
at
another
time
perhaps
lady
rhoann
was
fast
recovering
her
wonted
cool
poise
is
far
too
long
to
go
into
while
i
stand
here
half
naked
filthy
and
stinking
let
us
on
with
the
business
in
hand
which
for
me
is
a
hot
bath
and
clean
clothing
rhoann
strolled
away
as
unconcernedly
as
though
she
were
wearing
full
court
regalia
and
tedric
turned
to
the
king
thinkst
the
lady
trycie
is
nearby
sire
if
i
know
the
jade
at
all
she
is
phagon
snorted
and
not
only
near
she
seen
everything
and
heard
everything
knows
more
about
everything
than
either
of
us
or
both
of
us
together
why
thinkst
she
make
a
good
priestess
the
best
much
more
so
methinks
than
the
lady
rhoann
younger
more
umm
more
say
perhaps
phagon
was
very
evidently
skeptical
but
looked
around
the
temple
anyway
trycie
he
yelled
yes
father
a
soft
voice
answered
right
behind
them
the
king
second
daughter
was
very
like
his
first
in
size
and
shape
but
her
eyes
were
a
cerulean
blue
and
her
hair
as
long
and
as
thick
as
rhoann
own
had
the
color
of
ripe
wheat
aye
daughter
wouldst
like
to
be
priestess
of
llosir
oh
yes
she
squealed
but
sobered
quickly
on
second
thought
perhaps
not
no
if
sobeit
sacrifice
is
done
i
intend
to
marry
some
day
and
have
six
or
eight
children
but
perhaps
could
i
take
it
now
and
resign
later
think
you
not
be
necessary
sire
and
lady
trycie
tedric
put
in
while
phagon
was
still
thinking
the
matter
over
llosir
is
not
at
all
like
sarpedion
llosir
wants
abundance
and
fertility
and
happiness
not
poverty
and
sterility
and
misery
llosir
priestess
marries
as
she
pleases
and
has
as
many
children
as
she
wants
your
priestess
i
then
sirs
i
go
to
have
robes
made
at
once
the
last
words
came
floating
back
over
her
shoulder
as
trycie
raced
away
lord
tedric
sir
unobserved
sciro
had
been
waiting
for
a
chance
to
speak
to
his
superior
officer
yes
captain
is
the
men
the
cleaning
they
we
i
mean
sciro
of
old
lomarr
would
not
pass
the
buck
the
bodies
the
priests
you
know
and
so
on
were
easy
enough
and
we
did
manage
to
handle
most
of
the
pieces
of
the
god
but
the
the
heart
and
so
on
you
know
we
know
not
where
you
want
them
taken
and
besides
we
fear
wilt
stand
by
and
ward
lord
tedric
while
i
pick
them
up
is
my
business
captain
sciro
mine
alone
i
crave
pardon
for
not
attending
to
it
sooner
hast
a
bag
yea
the
highly
relieved
officer
held
out
a
of
fine
soft
leather
tedric
took
it
strode
across
to
the
place
where
sarpedion
image
had
stood
and
not
without
a
few
qualms
of
his
own
now
that
the
frenzy
of
battle
had
evaporated
picked
up
sarpedion
heart
liver
and
brain
and
deposited
them
neither
too
carefully
nor
too
carelessly
in
the
sack
then
swinging
the
burden
up
over
his
shoulder
i
go
to
fetch
the
others
he
explained
to
his
king
then
we
hold
sacrifice
to
end
all
human
sacrifice
hold
tedric
phagon
ordered
one
thing
or
two
or
three
methinks
is
not
seemly
to
conduct
a
thing
so
lacking
order
and
organization
and
plan
where
dost
propose
to
hold
such
an
affair
not
in
your
ironworks
surely
certainly
not
sire
tedric
halted
almost
in
midstride
he
got
around
yet
to
thinking
about
the
operation
as
a
whole
but
he
began
to
do
so
then
and
certainly
not
on
this
temple
or
own
lord
llosir
is
clean
all
our
temples
are
foul
in
every
stone
and
timber
he
paused
then
suddenly
i
have
it
sire
the
amphitheater
the
amphitheater
is
well
is
of
little
enough
use
and
a
shrine
will
not
interfere
with
what
little
use
it
has
wilt
give
orders
to
build
the
lord
of
the
marches
issues
his
own
orders
hola
schillan
to
me
the
monarch
shouted
and
the
chamberlain
of
the
realm
came
on
the
run
lord
tedric
speaks
with
my
voice
i
hear
sire
lord
tedric
i
listen
have
built
at
speed
midway
along
the
front
of
the
amphitheater
on
the
very
edge
of
the
cliff
a
table
of
clean
stone
ten
feet
square
and
three
feet
high
on
it
mount
lord
llosir
so
firmly
that
he
will
stand
upright
forever
against
whatever
may
come
of
wind
or
storm
the
chamberlain
hurried
away
so
did
tedric
with
his
bag
of
spoils
first
to
his
shop
where
his
armor
was
removed
and
where
he
scratched
himself
vigorously
and
delightfully
as
it
came
off
thence
to
the
temple
of
sarpedion
where
he
collected
the
other
trio
of
the
great
one
vital
organs
then
and
belatedly
to
home
and
to
bed
a
little
later
while
the
lord
of
the
marches
was
sleeping
soundly
the
king
messengers
rode
furiously
abroad
spreading
the
word
that
ten
days
hence
at
the
fourth
period
after
noon
in
amphitheater
great
sarpedion
would
be
sacrificed
to
llosir
new
and
god
the
city
of
lompoar
lomarr
capital
lying
on
the
south
bank
of
the
lotar
some
fifty
miles
inland
from
the
delta
nestled
against
the
rugged
breast
of
the
coast
range
just
outside
the
town
limit
and
some
hundreds
of
feet
above
its
principal
streets
there
was
a
gigantic
carved
out
of
the
solid
rock
by
an
eddy
of
some
age
this
was
the
amphitheater
and
on
the
very
lip
of
the
stupendous
cliff
descending
vertically
to
the
river
so
far
below
llosir
stood
proudly
on
his
platform
of
smooth
clean
granite
is
not
enough
like
a
god
methinks
king
phagon
dressed
now
in
eyed
the
gleaming
copper
statue
very
dubiously
is
too
much
like
a
man
by
far
is
exactly
as
i
saw
him
sire
tedric
replied
firmly
nor
was
he
consciously
lying
by
this
time
he
believed
the
lie
himself
llosir
is
a
remember
not
a
and
is
better
so
but
the
time
i
set
is
here
with
your
permission
sire
i
begin
both
men
looked
around
the
great
bowl
near
by
but
not
too
near
stood
the
priestess
and
half
a
dozen
girls
one
of
whom
carried
a
pitcher
full
of
perfumed
oil
another
a
flaring
open
lamp
wrought
of
the
same
material
slightly
to
one
side
were
rhoann
looking
if
the
truth
must
be
told
as
though
she
did
not
particularly
enjoy
her
present
position
on
the
her
mother
the
queen
the
rest
of
the
royal
family
and
ranks
of
courtiers
and
finally
much
farther
back
at
a
very
respectful
distance
from
their
strange
new
god
arranged
in
dozens
of
more
or
less
concentric
roughly
hemispherical
rows
stood
everybody
who
had
had
time
to
get
there
more
were
arriving
constantly
of
course
but
the
flood
had
become
a
trickle
the
narrow
way
worming
upward
from
the
city
along
the
cliffs
stark
side
was
almost
bare
of
traffic
begin
lord
tedric
said
the
king
tedric
bent
over
heaved
the
heavy
iron
pan
containing
the
offerings
up
onto
the
platform
and
turned
the
oil
priestess
lady
trycie
and
the
flame
the
acolyte
handed
the
pitcher
to
trycie
who
handed
it
to
tedric
who
poured
its
contents
over
the
twin
hearts
twin
livers
and
twin
brains
then
the
lamp
and
as
the
flames
leaped
upward
the
armored
stepped
backward
and
raised
his
eyes
boldly
to
the
impassive
face
of
the
image
of
his
god
then
he
spoke
not
softly
but
in
tones
audible
to
everyone
present
take
lord
llosir
all
the
strength
and
all
the
power
and
all
the
force
that
sarpedion
ever
had
use
them
we
beg
for
good
and
not
for
he
picked
up
the
blazing
pan
and
strode
toward
the
lip
of
the
precipice
smoky
flames
curling
backward
around
his
armored
figure
and
now
in
token
of
sarpedion
utter
and
complete
extinction
i
consign
these
the
last
vestiges
of
his
being
to
the
rushing
depths
of
oblivion
he
hurled
the
pan
and
its
fiercely
flaming
contents
out
over
the
terrific
brink
this
act
according
to
tedric
plan
was
to
end
the
program
but
it
did
long
before
the
fiery
mass
struck
water
his
attention
was
seized
by
a
long
moaning
gasp
from
a
multitude
of
throats
a
sound
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
before
even
imagined
he
whirled
and
saw
shimmering
in
a
structure
of
shimmering
bars
a
form
of
seeming
flesh
so
exactly
like
the
copper
image
in
every
detail
of
shape
that
it
might
well
have
come
from
the
same
mold
lord
llosir
in
the
tedric
exclaimed
and
went
to
one
knee
so
did
the
king
and
his
family
and
a
few
of
the
bravest
of
the
courtiers
most
of
the
latter
however
and
the
girl
acolytes
and
the
thronging
thousands
of
spectators
threw
themselves
flat
on
the
hard
ground
they
threw
themselves
flat
but
they
did
not
look
away
or
close
their
eyes
or
cover
their
faces
with
their
hands
on
the
contrary
each
one
stared
with
all
the
power
of
his
optic
nerves
the
god
mouth
opened
his
lips
moved
and
although
no
one
could
hear
any
sound
everyone
felt
words
resounding
throughout
the
deepest
recesses
of
his
being
i
have
taken
all
the
strength
all
the
power
all
the
force
all
of
everything
that
made
sarpedion
what
he
was
the
god
began
in
part
his
was
the
resonant
clang
of
a
brazen
bell
in
part
the
diapason
harmonies
of
an
impossibly
vast
organ
i
will
use
them
for
good
not
for
ill
i
am
glad
tedric
that
you
did
not
defile
my
hearth
for
this
is
a
hearth
remember
and
in
no
sense
an
altar
in
making
this
the
first
and
the
sacrifice
ever
to
be
made
to
me
you
trycie
are
the
first
of
my
priestesses
the
girl
shaking
visibly
gulped
three
times
before
she
could
speak
yea
my
my
lord
llosir
she
managed
finally
th
that
is
if
if
i
please
you
lord
sir
you
please
me
trycie
of
lomarr
nor
will
your
duties
be
onerous
being
only
to
see
to
it
that
your
maidens
keep
my
hearth
clean
and
my
statue
bright
to
you
my
lord
llo
llosir
sir
all
thanks
wilt
keep
trycie
raised
her
downcast
eyes
and
stopped
short
in
her
mouth
dropping
ludicrously
open
and
her
eyes
becoming
two
round
o
of
astonishment
the
air
above
the
yawning
abyss
was
as
empty
as
it
had
ever
been
the
god
had
disappeared
as
instantaneously
as
he
had
come
tedric
heavy
voice
silenced
the
murmured
wave
of
excitement
sweeping
the
bowl
that
is
all
he
bellowed
i
did
not
expect
the
lord
llosir
to
appear
in
the
flesh
at
this
time
i
know
not
when
or
ever
he
will
deign
to
appear
to
us
again
but
this
i
know
whether
or
not
he
ever
so
deigns
or
when
you
all
know
now
that
our
great
lord
llosir
lives
is
it
not
so
is
so
long
live
lord
llosir
tumultuous
yelling
filled
the
amphitheater
is
well
in
leaving
this
holy
place
all
will
file
between
me
and
the
shrine
first
our
king
then
the
lady
priestess
trycie
and
her
maids
then
the
family
then
the
court
then
the
rest
all
men
as
they
pass
will
raise
in
salute
all
women
will
bow
heads
will
be
naught
of
offerings
or
of
tribute
or
of
fractions
lord
llosir
is
a
not
a
huckstering
thieving
murdering
trickster
king
phagon
sire
wilt
lead
unhelmed
now
tedric
stood
rigidly
at
attention
before
the
image
of
his
god
the
king
did
not
march
straight
past
him
but
stopped
short
taking
off
his
ornate
and
lifting
his
right
arm
high
he
said
to
you
lord
llosir
my
sincere
thanks
for
what
hast
done
for
me
for
my
family
and
for
my
nation
while
is
not
seemly
that
lomarr
king
should
beg
i
ask
that
you
abandon
us
not
then
trycie
and
her
girls
we
engage
lord
sir
the
lady
priestess
said
at
a
whispered
word
from
tedric
to
keep
your
hearth
scrupulously
clean
your
statue
shining
bright
then
the
queen
followed
by
the
lady
rhoann
who
although
she
bowed
her
head
meekly
enough
was
shooting
envious
glances
at
her
sister
so
far
ahead
and
so
evidently
the
cynosure
of
so
many
eyes
the
rest
of
the
family
the
court
the
thronging
spectators
and
last
of
all
tedric
himself
helmet
tucked
under
left
arm
he
raised
his
brawny
right
arm
high
executed
a
stiff
left
face
and
march
proudly
at
the
rear
of
the
long
procession
and
as
the
people
made
their
way
down
the
steep
and
rugged
path
as
they
debouched
through
the
city
of
lompoar
as
they
traversed
the
highways
and
byways
back
to
the
towns
and
townlets
and
farms
from
which
they
had
come
it
was
very
evident
that
llosir
had
established
himself
as
no
other
god
had
ever
been
established
throughout
the
long
history
of
that
world
great
llosir
had
appeared
in
person
everyone
there
had
seen
him
with
his
own
eyes
everyone
there
had
heard
his
voice
a
voice
of
a
quality
impossible
for
any
mortal
being
human
or
otherwise
to
produce
a
voice
heard
not
with
the
ears
which
would
have
been
ordinary
enough
but
by
virtue
of
some
hitherto
completely
unknown
and
still
completely
unknowable
inner
sense
or
ability
evocable
only
by
the
god
everyone
there
had
heard
sensed
him
address
the
lord
armsmaster
and
the
lady
priestess
by
name
other
gods
had
appeared
personally
in
the
past
or
had
they
really
nobody
had
ever
seen
any
of
them
except
their
own
priests
the
priests
who
performed
the
sacrifices
and
who
fattened
on
the
fractions
llosir
now
wanted
neither
sacrifices
nor
fractions
and
powerful
although
he
was
had
appeared
to
and
had
spoken
to
everyone
alike
of
however
high
or
low
degree
throughout
the
whole
huge
amphitheater
not
to
the
priestess
only
not
only
to
those
of
the
old
blood
not
only
to
citizens
or
natives
of
lomarr
but
to
down
to
mercenaries
chance
visitors
and
such
long
live
lord
llosir
our
new
and
plenipotent
god
king
phagon
and
tedric
were
standing
at
a
table
in
the
of
the
studying
a
map
it
was
crudely
drawn
and
sketchy
this
map
and
full
of
blank
areas
and
gross
errors
but
this
was
not
an
age
of
fine
cartography
tark
first
is
still
my
thought
sire
tedric
insisted
stubbornly
is
closer
our
lines
shorter
a
victory
there
would
hearten
all
our
people
too
be
unexpected
lomarr
has
never
attacked
tark
whereas
your
royal
sire
and
his
sire
before
him
each
tried
to
loose
sarlon
grip
and
in
failing
but
increased
the
already
heavy
payments
of
tribute
too
in
case
of
something
short
of
victory
hast
only
the
one
pass
and
the
great
gorge
of
the
lotar
to
hold
reprisal
is
true
such
course
would
leave
the
marches
unheld
but
no
more
so
than
they
have
been
for
four
years
or
more
nay
man
phagon
snorted
testily
fail
four
parts
of
our
army
are
of
tark
thinkst
not
their
first
act
would
be
to
turn
against
us
and
make
common
cause
with
their
brethren
too
we
lack
strength
they
outnumber
us
two
to
one
nay
sarlon
first
then
perhaps
tark
but
not
before
then
but
sarlon
outnumbers
us
too
sire
especially
if
you
count
those
barbarian
devils
of
the
devossian
steppes
since
taggad
of
sarlon
lets
them
cross
his
lands
to
raid
the
marches
for
a
fraction
of
the
loot
no
doubt
is
certain
they
help
him
against
us
also
sire
your
father
and
your
grandfather
both
died
under
sarlonian
axes
true
but
neither
of
them
was
a
strategist
i
am
i
have
studied
this
matter
for
many
years
they
did
the
obvious
i
shall
not
nor
shall
sarlon
pay
tribute
merely
sarlon
must
and
shall
become
a
province
of
my
kingdom
so
argument
raged
until
phagon
got
up
onto
his
royal
high
horse
and
declared
it
his
royal
will
that
the
thing
was
to
be
done
his
way
and
no
other
whereupon
of
course
tedric
submitted
with
the
best
grace
he
could
muster
and
set
about
the
task
of
helping
get
the
army
ready
to
roll
toward
the
marches
some
three
and
a
half
hundreds
of
miles
to
the
north
tedric
fumed
tedric
fretted
tedric
swore
sulphurously
in
lomarrian
tarkian
sarlonian
devossian
and
all
the
other
languages
he
knew
all
his
noise
and
fury
were
however
of
very
little
avail
in
speeding
up
what
was
an
intrinsically
slow
process
between
times
of
cursing
and
urging
and
driving
tedric
was
wont
to
prowl
the
castle
and
its
environs
so
doing
one
day
he
came
upon
king
phagon
and
the
lady
rhoann
practicing
at
archery
lifting
his
arm
in
salute
to
his
sovereign
and
bowing
his
head
politely
to
the
lady
he
made
to
pass
on
hola
tedric
rhoann
called
wouldst
speed
a
flight
with
us
tedric
glanced
at
the
target
rhoann
was
beating
her
father
unmercifully
her
arrows
were
all
in
or
near
the
gold
while
his
golden
ones
were
scattered
far
and
wide
and
she
had
been
twitting
him
unmercifully
about
his
poor
marksmanship
phagon
was
in
no
merry
mood
this
was
very
evidently
no
competition
for
any
outsider
least
of
all
lomarr
armsmaster
to
enter
crave
pardon
my
lady
but
other
matters
press
your
evasions
are
so
transparent
my
lord
why
not
tell
the
truth
rhoann
did
not
exactly
sneer
at
the
man
obvious
embarrassment
but
it
was
very
clear
that
she
too
was
in
a
vicious
temper
mindst
not
beating
but
never
the
and
any
armsmaster
who
threwest
not
arrows
by
hand
at
this
range
to
beat
both
of
us
should
be
stripped
of
badge
tedric
quite
fatuously
leaped
at
the
bait
wouldst
permit
sire
the
king
roared
by
my
head
by
the
throne
by
llosir
liver
and
heart
and
brain
and
guts
no
cost
the
head
of
any
save
you
to
insult
me
so
shoot
sir
and
shoot
your
best
extending
his
own
bow
and
a
full
quiver
of
arrows
tedric
did
not
want
to
use
the
royal
weapon
but
at
the
girl
quick
imperative
gesture
he
smothered
his
incipient
protest
and
accepted
it
one
sighting
shot
sire
he
asked
and
drew
the
heavy
bow
nothing
whatever
could
have
forced
him
to
put
an
arrow
nearer
the
gold
than
the
farthest
of
the
king
to
avoid
doing
so
without
transparently
missing
the
target
completely
would
take
skill
since
one
golden
arrow
stood
a
bare
three
inches
from
the
edge
of
the
target
his
first
arrow
grazed
the
edge
of
the
butt
and
was
an
inch
low
his
second
plunged
into
the
padding
exactly
half
way
between
the
wildest
arrow
and
the
target
rim
then
so
rapidly
that
it
seemed
as
though
there
must
be
at
least
two
arrows
in
the
air
at
once
arrow
crashed
on
arrow
wood
snapping
as
iron
head
struck
feathered
shaft
at
end
the
rent
in
the
fabric
through
which
all
those
arrows
had
torn
their
way
could
have
been
covered
by
half
of
one
of
rhoann
hands
i
lose
sire
tedric
said
stiffly
returning
bow
and
empty
quiver
my
score
is
zero
phagon
knowing
himself
in
the
wrong
but
unable
to
bring
himself
to
apologize
did
what
he
considered
the
thing
i
used
to
shoot
like
that
he
complained
knowst
how
lost
i
my
skill
tedric
is
not
my
age
surely
is
not
my
place
to
say
sire
then
with
more
loyalty
than
sense
and
i
split
to
the
teeth
any
who
dare
so
insult
the
throne
what
the
monarch
roared
by
my
hold
father
rhoann
snapped
a
king
you
act
it
hard
blue
eyes
glared
steadily
into
unyielding
eyes
of
green
neither
the
thoroughly
angry
king
nor
the
equally
angry
princess
would
give
an
inch
she
broke
the
short
bitter
silence
say
naught
tedric
he
is
much
too
fain
to
boil
in
oil
or
flay
alive
any
who
tell
him
unpleasantnesses
however
true
but
father
you
boil
not
nor
flay
nor
seek
to
punish
otherwise
or
i
split
this
kingdom
asunder
like
a
melon
is
time
yea
long
past
time
that
told
you
the
unadorned
truth
hence
my
rascally
but
parent
here
is
hast
lolled
too
long
on
too
many
too
soft
cushions
hast
emptied
too
many
pots
and
tankards
and
flagons
hast
bedded
too
many
wenches
to
be
of
much
use
in
armor
or
with
any
style
of
weapon
in
the
passes
of
the
high
umpasseurs
the
flabbergasted
and
king
tried
to
think
of
some
answer
to
this
devastating
blast
but
could
he
appealed
to
tedric
wouldst
have
said
such
surely
not
not
i
sire
tedric
assured
him
quite
truthfully
and
even
if
true
a
thing
to
remedy
itself
before
we
reach
the
marches
wilt
regain
arm
and
eye
perhaps
the
girl
put
in
her
tone
still
distinctly
on
the
acid
side
if
he
matches
you
tedric
in
lolling
and
wining
and
wenching
yes
otherwise
no
how
much
wine
do
drink
each
day
one
cup
usually
sometimes
at
supper
on
the
march
think
carefully
friend
nay
i
meant
in
town
in
the
field
none
of
course
seest
father
what
thinkst
me
vixen
a
spineless
cuddlepet
from
this
minute
return
here
i
match
your
paragon
youngblade
loll
for
loll
cup
for
cup
wench
for
wench
is
it
what
you
been
niggling
at
me
to
say
aye
father
and
king
exactly
for
as
you
say
you
do
she
hugged
him
so
fervently
as
almost
to
lift
him
off
the
ground
kissed
him
twice
and
hurried
away
a
thing
i
would
like
to
talk
to
you
about
sire
tedric
said
quickly
before
the
king
could
bring
up
any
of
the
matters
just
past
armor
there
was
enough
of
the
to
equip
three
men
fully
and
headnecks
for
their
horses
you
sire
and
me
and
sciro
of
your
guard
break
precedent
sire
i
beg
and
wear
me
this
armor
of
proof
instead
of
the
gold
for
what
we
face
promises
to
be
worse
than
anything
you
or
i
have
yet
seen
i
fear
me
is
true
but
is
impossible
nonetheless
lomarr
king
wears
gold
he
fights
in
gold
at
need
he
dies
in
gold
and
that
was
tedric
knew
very
definitely
that
it
was
senseless
it
was
idiotic
but
it
was
absolutely
true
no
king
of
lomarr
could
possibly
break
that
particular
precedent
to
appear
in
that
spectacularly
conspicuous
fashion
one
flashing
golden
figure
in
a
sea
of
dull
was
part
of
the
king
job
the
fact
that
his
father
and
his
grandfather
and
so
on
for
six
generations
back
had
died
in
golden
armor
could
not
sway
him
any
more
than
it
could
have
swayed
tedric
himself
in
similar
case
but
there
might
be
a
way
out
but
need
it
be
gold
sire
wouldst
not
an
overlay
of
gold
suffice
yea
lord
tedric
and
be
a
welcome
thing
indeed
i
yearn
not
nor
did
my
father
nor
his
father
to
pit
gold
axe
less
to
hide
behind
ten
ranks
of
iron
while
others
fight
but
simply
is
not
possible
if
the
gold
be
thick
enough
for
the
rivets
to
hold
is
too
heavy
to
lift
if
thin
enough
to
be
possible
of
wearing
the
gold
flies
off
in
sheets
at
first
blow
and
the
fraud
is
revealed
hast
ideas
i
listen
i
know
not
sire
tedric
thought
for
minutes
i
have
seen
gold
hammered
into
thin
sheets
but
not
thin
enough
but
it
might
be
possible
to
hammer
it
thin
enough
to
be
overlaid
on
the
with
pitch
or
gum
wouldst
wear
it
so
sire
aye
my
tedric
and
gladly
just
so
the
overlay
comes
not
off
by
handsbreadths
under
blow
of
sword
or
axe
handsbreadths
nay
scratches
and
mars
of
course
easily
to
be
overlaid
again
ere
next
day
dawn
but
handsbreadths
nay
sire
in
that
case
try
and
may
great
llosir
guide
your
hand
tedric
went
forthwith
to
the
castle
and
got
a
chunk
of
raw
massy
gold
he
took
it
to
his
shop
and
tried
to
work
it
into
the
thin
smooth
film
he
could
visualize
so
clearly
and
tried
and
tried
and
tried
and
failed
and
failed
and
failed
he
was
still
trying
and
still
failing
three
weeks
later
time
was
running
short
the
hours
that
had
formerly
dragged
like
days
now
flew
like
minutes
his
crew
had
done
their
futile
best
to
help
bendon
his
foreman
was
still
standing
by
the
king
was
looking
on
and
offering
advice
so
were
rhoann
and
trycie
sciro
and
schillan
and
other
more
or
less
notable
persons
were
also
trying
to
be
of
use
tedric
strained
and
tense
was
pounding
carefully
at
a
sheet
of
his
latest
production
it
was
a
pitiful
thing
lumpy
in
spots
ragged
and
rough
with
holes
where
hammer
had
met
anvil
through
its
substance
the
smith
left
hand
twitched
at
precisely
the
wrong
instant
just
as
the
hammer
struck
the
flimsy
sheet
fell
into
three
ragged
pieces
completely
frustrated
tedric
leaped
backward
swore
fulminantly
and
hurled
the
hammer
with
all
his
strength
toward
the
nearest
wall
and
in
that
instant
there
appeared
in
the
now
familiar
structure
of
shimmering
interlaced
bars
the
form
of
flesh
that
was
llosir
the
god
high
in
the
air
directly
over
the
forge
the
apparition
hung
motionless
and
silent
and
stared
everyone
except
tedric
gave
homage
to
the
god
but
he
merely
switched
from
the
viciously
corrosive
devossian
words
he
had
been
using
to
more
parliamentary
lomarrian
is
it
possible
lord
sir
for
any
human
being
to
do
anything
with
this
foul
slimy
salvy
perverse
treacherous
and
stuff
it
is
definitely
not
only
possible
but
fairly
easy
and
fairly
simple
if
the
proper
tools
apparatus
and
techniques
are
employed
llosir
replied
ordinarily
in
your
lifetime
you
would
come
to
know
nothing
of
gold
leaf
although
really
gold
leaf
is
not
required
here
nor
of
skins
and
membranes
and
how
to
use
them
nor
of
the
adhesives
to
be
employed
and
the
techniques
of
employing
them
the
necessary
tools
and
materials
are
or
can
very
shortly
be
made
available
to
you
you
can
now
absorb
quite
readily
the
required
information
and
knowledge
for
this
business
of
beating
out
gold
leaf
your
hammer
and
anvil
are
both
completely
wrong
listen
carefully
and
remember
for
the
first
preliminary
thinning
down
you
take
a
lomarr
army
set
out
at
dawn
first
the
scouts
lean
hard
runners
stripped
to
clouts
and
moccasins
and
carrying
only
a
light
bow
and
a
few
arrows
apiece
then
the
hunters
they
too
scattered
widely
and
went
practically
naked
but
bore
the
bows
and
the
arrows
of
their
trade
then
the
heavy
horse
comparatively
few
in
number
but
of
the
old
blood
all
led
by
tedric
and
sciro
and
surrounding
glittering
phagon
and
his
it
took
a
lot
of
horse
to
carry
a
knight
of
the
old
blood
but
the
of
the
middle
marches
bred
for
size
and
strength
and
stamina
next
came
century
after
century
of
light
horse
mounted
swordsmen
and
spearmen
and
javelineers
followed
by
even
more
numerous
centuries
of
infantry
last
of
all
came
the
creaking
wagons
loaded
not
only
with
the
usual
supplies
and
equipment
of
war
but
also
with
thousands
of
loaves
of
bread
hard
flat
heavy
loaves
made
from
ling
the
grain
which
was
the
staple
cereal
of
the
region
bread
sire
tedric
had
asked
wonderingly
when
phagon
had
first
broached
the
idea
men
on
the
march
lived
on
meat
a
straight
unrelieved
diet
of
meat
for
weeks
and
months
on
end
and
all
too
frequently
not
enough
of
that
to
maintain
weight
and
strength
they
expected
nothing
else
an
occasional
chunk
of
bread
was
sheerest
luxury
bread
a
whole
loaf
each
man
a
day
aye
phagon
had
chuckled
in
reply
all
farmsmen
along
the
way
will
have
ready
my
fraction
of
ling
and
schillan
will
at
need
buy
more
to
each
man
a
loaf
each
day
and
all
the
meat
he
can
eat
is
why
we
go
up
the
midvale
where
farmsmen
all
breed
savage
dogs
to
guard
their
fields
hordes
of
game
such
feeding
will
be
noised
abroad
canst
think
of
a
better
device
to
lure
taggad
mercenaries
to
our
standards
tedric
could
there
is
no
need
to
dwell
in
detail
upon
the
army
long
slow
march
leaving
the
city
of
lompoar
it
moved
up
the
lotar
river
through
the
spectacularly
scenic
gorge
of
the
coast
range
and
into
the
middle
valley
that
incredibly
lush
and
fertile
region
which
lying
between
the
low
umpasseurs
on
the
east
and
the
coast
range
on
the
west
comprised
roughly
a
third
of
lomarr
area
into
and
through
the
straggling
hamlet
of
bonoy
lying
at
the
junction
of
the
midvale
river
with
the
lotar
then
straight
north
through
the
timberlands
and
meadows
of
the
midvale
west
bank
game
was
as
phagon
had
said
incredibly
plentiful
by
literally
thousands
to
one
both
domestic
animals
and
men
lippita
rolatoes
accides
the
largest
and
among
the
tastiest
of
lomarr
game
animals
were
so
abundant
that
one
good
hunter
could
kill
in
half
an
hour
enough
to
feed
a
century
for
a
day
hence
most
of
the
hunters
time
was
spent
in
their
traveling
dryers
preserving
meat
against
a
coming
day
of
need
on
up
the
bluely
placid
lake
midvale
a
full
day
march
long
and
half
that
in
width
past
the
chain
lakes
strung
on
the
river
like
beads
on
a
string
past
lake
ardo
and
on
toward
lake
middlemarch
and
the
middlemarch
castle
which
was
to
be
tedric
official
residence
henceforth
as
the
main
body
passed
the
head
of
the
lake
a
couple
of
scouts
brought
in
a
runner
bursting
with
news
thank
sarpedion
sire
i
had
not
to
run
to
lompoar
to
reach
you
he
cried
dropping
to
his
knees
middlemarch
castle
is
besieged
hurlo
of
the
marches
is
slain
and
he
went
on
to
tell
a
story
of
onslaught
and
slaughter
and
the
raiders
worn
iron
phagon
remarked
when
the
tale
was
done
sarlonian
iron
no
doubt
aye
sire
but
how
couldst
no
matter
take
him
to
the
rear
feed
him
you
this
raid
sire
tedric
said
rather
than
asked
after
scouts
and
runner
had
disappeared
aye
was
no
raid
but
the
first
skirmish
of
a
war
no
fool
taggad
of
sarlon
nor
issian
of
devoss
barbarian
though
he
is
they
knew
what
loomed
and
struck
first
the
only
surprise
was
hurlo
death
he
had
my
direct
orders
not
to
do
battle
any
force
however
but
to
withdraw
forthwith
into
the
castle
which
was
to
be
kept
stocked
to
withstand
a
siege
of
months
this
keeps
me
from
boiling
him
in
oil
for
stupidity
incompetence
and
disloyalty
phagon
frowned
in
thought
then
went
on
were
there
forces
that
appeared
not
surely
not
taggad
would
not
split
his
forces
at
all
seriously
is
but
to
annoy
me
or
perhaps
they
are
mostly
barbarians
despite
the
sarlonian
iron
to
harry
and
flee
is
no
doubt
their
aim
but
for
lomarr
good
not
one
of
them
should
escape
knowst
the
upper
midvale
tedric
above
the
lake
but
little
sire
a
few
miles
only
i
was
there
but
once
is
enough
take
half
the
royal
guard
and
a
century
of
bowmen
cross
the
midvale
at
the
ford
three
miles
above
us
here
go
up
and
around
the
lake
the
upper
midvale
is
fordable
almost
anywhere
at
this
season
so
stay
far
enough
away
from
the
lake
that
none
see
you
cross
it
swing
in
a
wide
circle
toward
the
peninsula
on
which
sits
middlemarch
castle
and
in
three
days
three
days
will
be
ample
sire
three
days
from
tomorrow
dawn
exactly
as
the
top
rim
of
the
sun
clears
the
meadow
make
your
charge
out
of
the
covering
forest
with
your
archers
spread
to
pick
off
all
who
seek
to
flee
i
will
be
on
this
side
of
the
peninsula
between
us
they
be
ground
like
ling
none
shall
get
away
phagon
assumptions
however
were
slightly
in
error
when
riders
charged
at
the
crack
of
the
indicated
dawn
they
did
not
tear
through
a
motley
horde
of
barbarians
instead
they
struck
two
full
centuries
of
sarlon
heaviest
armor
and
phagon
the
king
fared
worse
at
first
sight
of
that
brilliant
golden
armor
a
solid
column
of
armored
knights
formed
as
though
by
magic
and
charged
it
at
full
gallop
phagon
fought
of
course
fought
as
his
breed
had
always
fought
at
first
on
horse
with
his
terrible
sword
under
the
trenchant
edge
of
which
knight
after
knight
died
his
horse
dropped
slaughtered
his
sword
was
knocked
away
but
afoot
the
chained
to
his
steel
belt
by
links
of
was
still
his
he
swung
and
swung
and
swung
again
again
and
again
and
with
each
swing
an
enemy
ceased
to
live
but
sheer
weight
of
metal
was
too
much
finally
still
swinging
his
murderous
weapon
phagon
of
lomarr
went
flat
on
the
ground
at
the
first
assault
on
their
king
tedric
with
his
sword
and
sciro
with
his
hammer
had
gone
starkly
berserk
sciro
was
nearer
but
tedric
was
faster
and
stronger
and
had
the
better
horse
dreegor
he
yelled
thumping
his
steed
sides
with
his
armored
legs
and
rising
high
in
his
stirrups
nostrils
flaring
the
mighty
beast
raged
forward
and
tedric
struck
as
he
had
never
struck
before
eight
times
that
terrific
blade
came
down
and
eight
men
and
eight
horses
died
then
suddenly
tedric
never
did
know
how
it
happened
since
dreegor
was
later
found
uninjured
he
found
himself
afoot
no
place
for
sword
this
but
made
to
order
for
axe
hence
driving
forward
as
resistlessly
as
though
a
phalanx
of
iron
were
behind
him
he
hewed
his
way
toward
his
sovereign
thus
he
was
near
at
hand
when
phagon
went
down
so
was
doughty
sciro
and
by
the
time
the
sarlonians
had
learned
that
sword
nor
axe
nor
hammer
could
cut
or
smash
that
armor
fury
personified
was
upon
them
tedric
straddled
his
king
head
sciro
his
feet
and
back
to
back
two
of
lomarr
mightiest
armsmasters
wove
circular
webs
of
flying
steel
through
which
it
was
sheerest
suicide
to
attempt
to
pass
thus
battle
raged
until
the
last
armored
foeman
was
down
art
hurt
sire
tedric
asked
anxiously
as
he
and
sciro
lifted
phagon
to
his
feet
nay
my
the
monarch
gasped
still
panting
for
breath
bruised
merely
and
somewhat
winded
he
opened
his
visor
to
let
more
air
in
then
as
he
regained
control
he
shook
off
the
supporting
hands
and
stood
erect
under
his
own
power
i
fear
me
tedric
that
you
and
that
vixen
daughter
of
mine
were
in
some
sense
right
methinks
i
may
be
oh
the
veriest
trifle
out
of
condition
but
the
battle
is
almost
over
did
any
escape
none
had
is
well
tedric
i
know
not
how
to
honor
honor
me
no
farther
sire
i
beg
hast
honored
me
already
far
more
than
i
deserved
or
ever
will
or
at
least
at
the
moment
there
may
be
later
perhaps
that
is
a
thing
he
fell
silent
a
thing
phagon
grinned
broadly
i
know
not
whether
rhoann
will
be
overly
pleased
at
being
called
so
but
be
borne
in
mind
nonetheless
now
you
sciro
lord
sciro
now
and
henceforth
and
all
your
line
lord
of
what
i
will
not
now
say
but
when
we
have
taken
sarlo
you
and
all
others
shall
know
my
thanks
sire
and
my
obeisance
said
sciro
schillan
with
me
to
my
pavilion
i
am
weary
and
sore
and
would
fain
rest
as
the
two
lords
of
the
realm
so
lately
commoners
strode
away
to
do
what
had
to
be
done
neither
of
us
feels
any
nobler
than
ever
i
know
sciro
said
but
in
one
way
is
well
very
well
indeed
the
lady
trycie
eh
the
wind
does
set
so
then
as
i
thought
aye
for
long
and
long
it
wondered
me
often
your
choice
of
the
lady
rhoann
over
howbeit
be
a
wondrous
thing
to
be
your
as
well
as
in
arms
tedric
grinned
companionably
but
before
he
could
reply
they
had
to
separate
and
go
to
work
the
king
did
not
rest
long
the
heralds
called
tedric
in
before
half
his
job
was
done
what
thinkst
you
tedric
should
be
next
phagon
asked
first
punish
devoss
sire
tedric
snarled
them
storm
high
pass
if
defended
raze
half
the
steppes
with
sword
and
torch
drive
them
the
full
length
of
their
country
and
into
northern
sound
interesting
my
impetuous
youngblade
but
not
at
all
practical
phagon
countered
hast
considered
the
matter
of
time
the
avalanches
of
rocks
doubtless
set
up
and
ready
to
sweep
those
narrow
paths
what
taggad
would
be
doing
while
we
cavort
through
the
wastelands
tedric
deflated
almost
instantaneously
nay
sire
he
admitted
sheepishly
i
thought
not
of
any
such
is
the
trouble
with
you
you
know
not
to
think
phagon
was
deadly
serious
now
is
a
hard
thing
to
learn
impossible
for
many
but
learn
it
you
must
if
you
end
not
as
hurlo
ended
also
take
heed
disobey
my
orders
but
once
as
hurlo
did
and
you
hang
in
chains
from
the
highest
battlement
of
your
own
castle
middlemarch
until
your
bones
rot
apart
and
drop
into
the
lake
his
monarch
vicious
threat
or
rather
promise
left
tedric
completely
unmoved
is
what
i
would
deserve
sire
or
less
but
no
fear
of
that
stupid
i
may
be
but
disloyal
nay
sire
your
word
always
has
been
and
always
will
be
my
law
not
stupid
tedric
but
lacking
in
judgment
which
is
not
as
bad
since
the
condition
is
if
you
care
enough
to
make
it
so
remediable
you
care
enough
tedric
you
learn
and
quickly
for
much
more
than
your
own
life
is
at
hazard
the
younger
man
stared
questioningly
and
the
king
went
on
my
life
the
lives
of
my
family
and
the
future
of
all
lomarr
he
said
quietly
in
that
case
sire
wilt
learn
and
quickly
tedric
declared
and
as
days
and
weeks
went
by
he
did
all
previous
attempts
on
the
city
of
sarlo
were
made
in
what
seemed
to
be
the
only
feasible
way
crossing
the
tegula
at
lower
ford
going
down
its
north
bank
through
the
gorge
to
the
west
branch
and
down
that
to
the
sarlo
phagon
was
lecturing
from
a
large
map
using
a
sharp
stick
as
pointer
tedric
sciro
schillan
and
two
or
three
other
officers
were
watching
and
listening
the
west
branch
flows
into
sarlo
only
forty
miles
above
sarlo
bay
the
city
of
sarlo
is
here
on
the
north
bank
of
the
sarlo
river
right
on
the
bay
and
is
surrounded
by
water
the
sarlo
river
is
wide
and
deep
uncrossable
against
any
real
opposition
thus
sarlonian
strategy
has
always
been
not
to
make
any
strong
stand
anywhere
along
the
west
branch
but
to
fight
delaying
actions
merely
making
their
real
stand
on
the
north
bank
of
the
sarlo
only
a
few
miles
from
sarlo
city
itself
the
sarlo
river
gentlemen
is
well
called
shield
it
has
never
been
crossed
how
do
you
expect
to
cross
it
then
sire
schillan
asked
strictly
speaking
we
cross
it
not
but
float
down
it
we
cross
the
tegula
at
upper
ford
not
lower
ford
sire
above
the
terrible
gorge
of
the
low
umpasseurs
yea
that
gorge
undefended
is
passable
is
rugged
but
passage
can
be
made
once
through
the
gorge
our
way
to
the
lake
of
the
spiders
from
which
springs
the
middle
branch
of
the
sarlo
is
clear
and
open
but
is
held
sire
that
middle
valley
is
impassable
for
troops
a
grizzled
captain
protested
we
traverse
it
nonetheless
on
rafts
at
six
or
seven
miles
an
hour
faster
by
far
than
any
army
can
march
but
is
enough
of
explanation
lord
sciro
attend
i
listen
sire
at
earliest
dawn
take
two
centuries
of
axemen
and
one
century
of
bowmen
with
the
wagonload
of
supplies
about
which
some
of
you
have
wondered
strike
straight
north
at
forced
march
cross
the
tegula
straight
north
again
to
the
lake
of
the
spiders
and
the
head
of
the
middle
branch
build
rafts
large
enough
and
of
sufficient
number
to
bear
our
whole
force
strong
enough
to
stand
rough
usage
the
rafts
should
be
done
or
nearly
by
the
time
we
get
there
i
hear
sire
and
i
obey
tedric
almost
stunned
by
the
novelty
and
audacity
of
this
the
first
amphibian
operation
in
the
history
of
his
world
was
dubious
but
willing
and
as
the
map
of
that
operation
spread
itself
in
his
mind
he
grew
enthusiastic
we
attack
then
not
from
the
south
but
from
the
aye
and
on
solid
ground
not
across
deep
water
but
to
bed
gentlemen
tomorrow
the
clarions
sound
before
dawn
dawn
came
sciro
and
his
force
struck
out
the
main
army
marched
away
up
the
north
bank
of
the
upper
midvale
which
for
thirty
or
forty
miles
flowed
almost
directly
from
the
there
however
it
circled
sharply
to
flow
from
the
and
the
lomarrians
left
it
continuing
their
march
across
undulating
foothills
straight
for
upper
ford
from
the
south
the
approach
to
this
ford
lying
just
above
east
of
the
low
umpasseur
mountains
at
the
point
where
the
middle
marches
mounted
a
stiff
but
not
abrupt
gradient
to
become
the
upper
marches
was
not
too
difficult
nor
was
the
entrapment
of
most
of
the
sarlonians
and
barbarians
on
watch
the
stream
while
only
for
the
most
part
was
wide
fast
and
rough
the
bottom
was
made
up
in
toto
of
rounded
mossy
extremely
slippery
rocks
there
were
enough
men
and
horses
and
lines
however
so
that
the
crossing
was
made
without
loss
then
turning
of
a
circle
the
cavalcade
made
slow
way
back
down
the
river
along
its
north
bank
toward
the
forbidding
gorge
of
the
low
umpasseurs
the
north
bank
was
different
vastly
different
from
the
south
one
mountains
of
bare
rock
incredible
thousands
of
feet
higher
than
the
plateau
forming
the
south
bank
towered
at
the
rushing
very
edge
what
passed
for
a
road
was
narrow
steep
full
of
turns
and
fearfully
rugged
but
this
too
was
passed
by
dint
of
what
labor
and
stress
it
is
not
necessary
to
dwell
upon
and
as
the
army
debouched
out
onto
the
gullied
and
eroded
terrain
of
the
high
barren
valley
and
began
to
make
camp
for
the
night
tedric
became
deeply
concerned
sciro
small
force
would
have
left
no
obvious
or
lasting
traces
of
its
passing
but
such
blatant
disfigurements
as
these
he
glanced
at
the
king
then
stared
back
at
the
broad
trampled
way
the
army
had
come
south
of
the
river
our
tracks
do
not
matter
he
said
flatly
in
the
gorge
they
exist
not
but
traces
sire
matter
greatly
and
are
not
to
be
covered
or
concealed
tedric
i
approve
of
you
you
begin
to
think
much
to
the
young
surprise
phagon
smiled
broadly
how
wouldst
handle
the
thing
if
decision
yours
a
couple
of
fives
of
bowmen
to
camp
here
or
nearby
sire
tedric
replied
promptly
to
put
arrows
through
any
who
come
to
spy
is
a
sound
idea
but
not
enough
by
half
here
i
leave
and
a
full
century
each
of
our
best
scouts
and
hunters
see
to
it
my
lord
captain
that
none
sees
this
our
trail
from
here
to
the
lake
of
the
spiders
or
having
seen
it
lives
to
tell
of
the
seeing
tedric
after
selecting
his
and
watching
them
melt
invisibly
into
the
landscape
went
down
the
valley
about
a
mile
and
hid
himself
carefully
in
a
cave
these
men
knew
the
business
in
hand
a
lot
better
than
he
did
and
he
would
not
interfere
what
he
was
for
was
to
take
command
in
an
emergency
if
the
operation
were
a
complete
success
he
would
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
he
was
still
in
the
cave
days
later
when
word
came
that
the
launching
had
begun
rounding
up
his
guerillas
he
led
them
at
a
fast
pace
to
the
lake
of
the
spiders
around
it
and
to
the
place
where
the
lomarrian
army
had
been
encamped
four
rafts
were
waiting
and
tedric
noticed
with
surprise
that
a
sort
of
house
had
been
built
on
the
one
lying
farthest
this
luxury
he
learned
was
for
him
and
his
squire
rahlion
and
their
horses
and
armor
the
middle
branch
was
wide
and
swift
and
to
tedric
and
his
bowmen
landlubbers
all
it
was
terrifyingly
rough
and
boisterous
and
full
of
rocks
tedric
however
did
not
stay
a
landlubber
long
he
was
not
the
type
to
sit
in
idleness
when
there
was
something
physical
to
do
something
new
to
learn
and
learning
to
be
a
riverman
was
so
much
easier
than
learning
to
be
king
phagon
idea
of
a
strategist
thus
stripped
to
clout
and
moccasins
tedric
reveled
in
pitting
his
strength
and
speed
at
or
pole
against
the
raft
mass
and
the
river
whim
a
good
man
him
the
boss
boatman
remarked
to
one
of
his
mates
then
later
to
tedric
himself
is
shame
lord
that
you
got
to
work
at
this
lord
business
wouldst
make
a
damn
good
riverman
in
time
my
thanks
sir
and
be
more
fun
but
king
phagon
knows
best
but
this
you
talk
of
what
is
it
is
where
this
middle
branch
turns
a
square
angle
solid
rock
to
flow
west
into
the
sarlo
the
roughest
wickedest
bit
of
water
anybody
ever
tried
to
run
a
raft
over
canst
try
it
with
me
if
you
like
please
me
greatly
to
try
well
short
of
the
bend
each
raft
was
snubbed
to
the
shore
and
unloaded
when
the
first
one
was
bare
the
boss
riverman
and
a
score
of
his
best
men
stepped
aboard
so
did
tedric
what
folly
this
phagon
yelled
tedric
ashore
canst
swim
lord
tedric
the
boss
asked
like
an
eel
tedric
admitted
modestly
and
the
riverman
turned
to
the
king
save
you
rafts
sire
if
he
works
with
us
he
quick
as
a
cat
and
strong
as
a
bull
and
knows
more
of
white
water
already
than
half
my
men
in
that
case
phagon
waved
his
hand
and
the
first
raft
took
off
many
of
the
rafts
were
lost
of
course
and
tedric
had
to
swim
in
icy
water
more
than
once
but
he
loved
every
exhausting
exciting
second
of
the
time
nor
were
the
broken
logs
of
the
wrecked
rafts
allowed
to
drift
down
the
river
as
each
bit
was
hauled
carefully
ashore
below
the
bend
the
middle
branch
was
wide
and
deep
hence
the
reloaded
rafts
had
smooth
sailing
and
the
sarlo
itself
was
of
course
wider
and
deeper
still
in
fact
it
would
have
been
easily
navigable
by
an
modern
liner
the
only
care
now
was
to
avoid
discovery
which
matter
was
attended
to
by
several
centuries
of
scouts
and
by
scores
of
rivermen
in
commandeered
boats
moyla
landing
the
predetermined
point
of
debarkation
was
a
scant
fifteen
miles
from
the
city
of
sarlo
it
was
scarcely
a
hamlet
but
even
so
any
one
of
its
few
inhabitants
could
have
given
the
alarm
hence
it
was
surrounded
by
an
advance
force
of
bowmen
and
spearmen
and
before
those
soldiers
set
out
phagon
voiced
the
orders
he
was
to
repeat
so
often
during
the
following
hectic
days
no
burning
and
no
wanton
killing
none
must
know
we
come
but
nonetheless
sarlon
is
to
be
a
province
of
lomarr
my
kingdom
and
will
not
have
its
people
or
its
substance
to
that
end
i
swear
by
my
royal
head
by
the
throne
by
great
llosir
heart
and
brain
and
liver
that
any
man
of
whatever
rank
who
slays
or
burns
without
my
express
permission
will
be
flayed
alive
and
then
boiled
in
oil
hence
the
taking
of
moyla
landing
was
very
quiet
and
its
people
were
held
under
close
guard
all
that
day
and
all
the
following
night
the
army
rested
phagon
was
pretty
sure
that
taggad
knew
nothing
of
the
invasion
as
yet
but
it
would
be
idle
to
hope
to
get
much
closer
without
being
discovered
every
mile
gained
however
would
be
worth
a
century
of
men
therefore
long
before
dawn
the
supremely
ready
lomarrian
forces
rolled
over
the
screening
bluff
and
marched
steadily
toward
sarlo
not
fast
note
thirteen
miles
is
a
long
haul
when
there
is
to
be
a
battle
at
the
end
of
it
plodding
slowly
along
on
mighty
dreegor
at
the
king
right
tedric
roused
himself
from
a
brown
study
and
gathering
his
forces
visibly
spoke
knowst
i
love
the
lady
rhoann
sire
aye
no
secret
that
nor
has
been
since
the
fall
of
sarpedion
hast
permission
then
to
ask
her
to
be
my
wife
once
back
in
lompoar
mayst
ask
her
sooner
than
that
if
you
like
wilt
be
here
tomorrow
with
the
family
the
court
and
an
image
of
great
llosir
for
the
triumph
tedric
mouth
dropped
open
but
sire
he
managed
finally
how
couldst
be
sure
of
success
the
armies
are
too
evenly
matched
in
seeming
only
they
have
no
body
of
horse
or
foot
able
to
stand
against
my
royal
guard
they
have
nothing
to
cope
with
you
and
sciro
and
your
armor
and
weapons
therefore
i
have
been
and
am
certain
of
lomarr
success
and
ventures
do
not
fail
this
has
been
long
in
the
planning
but
only
your
discovery
of
the
made
it
possible
of
execution
then
as
tedric
glanced
involuntarily
at
his
armor
yea
the
overlay
made
it
possible
for
me
to
live
although
i
may
die
this
day
being
the
center
of
attack
and
being
weaker
and
of
lesser
endurance
that
i
thought
but
my
life
matters
not
beside
the
good
of
lomarr
a
king
life
is
of
import
only
to
himself
to
his
family
and
to
a
few
wouldst
be
surprised
to
learn
how
few
real
friends
your
life
matters
to
me
sire
and
to
sciro
aye
tedric
my
that
i
know
art
in
the
forefront
of
those
few
i
spoke
of
and
take
this
not
seriously
for
i
expect
fully
to
live
but
in
case
i
die
remember
this
kings
come
and
kings
go
but
as
long
as
it
holds
the
loyalty
of
such
as
you
and
sciro
and
your
kind
the
throne
of
lomarr
endures
taggad
of
sarlon
was
not
taken
completely
by
surprise
however
he
had
little
enough
warning
and
so
violent
and
hasty
was
his
mobilization
that
the
sarlonians
were
little
if
any
fresher
than
the
lomarrians
when
they
met
a
couple
of
miles
outside
the
city
limit
there
is
no
need
to
describe
in
detail
the
arrangement
of
the
centuries
and
the
legions
nor
to
dwell
at
length
upon
the
bloodiness
and
savagery
of
the
conflict
as
a
whole
nor
to
pick
out
individual
deeds
of
of
heroism
or
of
cowardice
of
prime
interest
here
is
the
climactic
charge
of
lomarr
heavy
horse
the
royal
guard
that
ended
it
there
was
little
enough
of
finesse
in
that
terrific
charge
led
by
glittering
phagon
and
his
two
lords
the
best
their
middlemarch
horses
could
do
in
the
way
of
speed
was
a
lumbering
canter
but
their
tremendous
masses
a
middlemarch
warhorse
was
not
considered
worth
saving
unless
he
weighed
at
least
one
long
ton
added
to
the
weight
of
man
and
armor
each
bore
gave
them
momentum
starkly
irresistible
into
and
through
the
ranks
of
sarlonian
armor
the
knights
of
lomarr
old
blood
crashed
each
rising
in
his
stirrups
and
swinging
down
with
all
his
might
with
sword
or
axe
or
hammer
upon
whatever
luckless
wight
was
nearest
at
hand
then
a
backward
smash
then
another
drive
forward
but
men
were
being
unhorsed
horses
were
being
hamstrung
or
killed
of
a
sudden
king
phagon
himself
went
down
unhorsed
but
not
out
his
axe
scarcely
stoppable
by
iron
was
taking
heavy
toll
as
at
signal
every
mounted
guardsman
left
his
saddle
as
one
and
every
guardsman
who
could
move
drove
toward
the
flashing
golden
figure
of
his
king
where
now
sire
tedric
yelled
above
the
clang
of
iron
taggad
pavilion
of
course
where
else
phagon
yelled
back
guardsmen
to
me
tedric
roared
make
wedge
as
you
did
at
sarpedion
temple
and
the
knights
who
could
not
hear
him
were
made
by
signs
to
understand
what
was
required
to
that
purple
tent
we

with

at
point
tedric
and
sciro
were
so
close
beside
and
behind
the
king
as
almost
to
be
one
with
him
that
flying
wedge
simply
could
not
be
stopped
in
little
over
a
minute
it
reached
the
pavilion
and
its
terribly
surprised
owner
golden
tigers
seemed
to
leap
and
creep
as
the
lustrous
silk
of
the
tent
rippled
in
the

what
taggad
began
a
conciliatory
speech
but
even
while
speaking
he
whirled
a
long
and
heavy
sword
out
from
behind
him
leaped
and
struck
so
fast
that
neither
phagon
nor
either
of
his
lords
had
time
to
move
so
viciously
hard
that
had
lomarr
monarch
been
wearing

there
as
it

the
heavy

twisted

double
and
broke
phagon
was
automatic
his
axe
swung
with
all
his
strength
and
speed
crashed
to
the
helve
through
iron
and
bone
and
brain
and
as
soon
as
the
heralds
with
their
clarions
could
spread
the

that
