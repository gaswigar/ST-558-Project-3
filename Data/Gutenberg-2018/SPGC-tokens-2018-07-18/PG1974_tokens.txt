in
this

to
retain
the
accuracy
of
this

those
words
are
rendered
by
spelling
out
each
greek
letter
individually
such
as
alpha

the

can
distinguish
these

by
the

i
propose
to
treat
of
poetry
in
itself
and
of
its
various
kinds
noting
the
essential
quality
of
each
to
inquire
into
the
structure
of
the
plot
as
requisite
to
a
good
poem
into
the
number
and
nature
of
the
parts
of
which
a
poem
is
composed
and
similarly
into
whatever
else
falls
within
the
same
inquiry
following
then
the
order
of
nature
let
us
begin
with
the
principles
which
come
first
epic
poetry
and
tragedy
comedy
also
and
dithyrambic
poetry
and
the
music
of
the
flute
and
of
the
lyre
in
most
of
their
forms
are
all
in
their
general
conception
modes
of
imitation
they
differ
however
from
one
another
in
three
respects
the
medium
the
objects
the
manner
or
mode
of
imitation
being
in
each
case
distinct
for
as
there
are
persons
who
by
conscious
art
or
mere
habit
imitate
and
represent
various
objects
through
the
medium
of
colour
and
form
or
again
by
the
voice
so
in
the
arts
above
mentioned
taken
as
a
whole
the
imitation
is
produced
by
rhythm
language
or
either
singly
or
combined
thus
in
the
music
of
the
flute
and
of
the
lyre
and
rhythm
alone
are
employed
also
in
other
arts
such
as
that
of
the
pipe
which
are
essentially
similar
to
these
in
dancing
rhythm
alone
is
used
without
for
even
dancing
imitates
character
emotion
and
action
by
rhythmical
movement
there
is
another
art
which
imitates
by
means
of
language
alone
and
that
either
in
prose
or
verse
which
verse
again
may
either
combine
different
metres
or
consist
of
but
one
kind
but
this
has
hitherto
been
without
a
name
for
there
is
no
common
term
we
could
apply
to
the
mimes
of
sophron
and
xenarchus
and
the
socratic
dialogues
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
to
poetic
imitations
in
iambic
elegiac
or
any
similar
metre
people
do
indeed
add
the
word
or
to
the
name
of
the
metre
and
speak
of
elegiac
poets
or
epic
that
is
hexameter
poets
as
if
it
were
not
the
imitation
that
makes
the
poet
but
the
verse
that
entitles
them
all
indiscriminately
to
the
name
even
when
a
treatise
on
medicine
or
natural
science
is
brought
out
in
verse
the
name
of
poet
is
by
custom
given
to
the
author
and
yet
homer
and
empedocles
have
nothing
in
common
but
the
metre
so
that
it
would
be
right
to
call
the
one
poet
the
other
physicist
rather
than
poet
on
the
same
principle
even
if
a
writer
in
his
poetic
imitation
were
to
combine
all
metres
as
chaeremon
did
in
his
centaur
which
is
a
medley
composed
of
metres
of
all
kinds
we
should
bring
him
too
under
the
general
term
poet
so
much
then
for
these
distinctions
there
are
again
some
arts
which
employ
all
the
means
above
mentioned
namely
rhythm
tune
and
metre
such
are
dithyrambic
and
nomic
poetry
and
also
tragedy
and
comedy
but
between
them
the
difference
is
that
in
the
first
two
cases
these
means
are
all
employed
in
combination
in
the
latter
now
one
means
is
employed
now
another
such
then
are
the
differences
of
the
arts
with
respect
to
the
medium
of
imitation
ii
since
the
objects
of
imitation
are
men
in
action
and
these
men
must
be
either
of
a
higher
or
a
lower
type
for
moral
character
mainly
answers
to
these
divisions
goodness
and
badness
being
the
distinguishing
marks
of
moral
differences
it
follows
that
we
must
represent
men
either
as
better
than
in
real
life
or
as
worse
or
as
they
are
it
is
the
same
in
painting
polygnotus
depicted
men
as
nobler
than
they
are
pauson
as
less
noble
dionysius
drew
them
true
to
life
now
it
is
evident
that
each
of
the
modes
of
imitation
above
mentioned
will
exhibit
these
differences
and
become
a
distinct
kind
in
imitating
objects
that
are
thus
distinct
such
diversities
may
be
found
even
in
dancing
and
so
again
in
language
whether
prose
or
verse
unaccompanied
by
music
homer
for
example
makes
men
better
than
they
are
cleophon
as
they
are
hegemon
the
thasian
the
inventor
of
parodies
and
nicochares
the
author
of
the
deiliad
worse
than
they
are
the
same
thing
holds
good
of
dithyrambs
and
nomes
here
too
one
may
portray
different
types
as
timotheus
and
philoxenus
differed
in
representing
their
cyclopes
the
same
distinction
marks
off
tragedy
from
comedy
for
comedy
aims
at
representing
men
as
worse
tragedy
as
better
than
in
actual
life
iii
there
is
still
a
third
difference
the
manner
in
which
each
of
these
objects
may
be
imitated
for
the
medium
being
the
same
and
the
objects
the
same
the
poet
may
imitate
by
narration
in
which
case
he
can
either
take
another
personality
as
homer
does
or
speak
in
his
own
person
unchanged
or
he
may
present
all
his
characters
as
living
and
moving
before
us
these
then
as
we
said
at
the
beginning
are
the
three
differences
which
distinguish
artistic
imitation
the
medium
the
objects
and
the
manner
so
that
from
one
point
of
view
sophocles
is
an
imitator
of
the
same
kind
as
homer
for
both
imitate
higher
types
of
character
from
another
point
of
view
of
the
same
kind
as
aristophanes
for
both
imitate
persons
acting
and
doing
hence
some
say
the
name
of
is
given
to
such
poems
as
representing
action
for
the
same
reason
the
dorians
claim
the
invention
both
of
tragedy
and
comedy
the
claim
to
comedy
is
put
forward
by
the
megarians
not
only
by
those
of
greece
proper
who
allege
that
it
originated
under
their
democracy
but
also
by
the
megarians
of
sicily
for
the
poet
epicharmus
who
is
much
earlier
than
chionides
and
magnes
belonged
to
that
country
tragedy
too
is
claimed
by
certain
dorians
of
the
peloponnese
in
each
case
they
appeal
to
the
evidence
of
language
the
outlying
villages
they
say
are
by
them
called
kappa
omega
mu
alpha
iota
by
the
athenians
delta
eta
mu
iota
and
they
assume
that
comedians
were
so
named
not
from
kappa
omega
mu
zeta
epsilon
iota
nu
revel
but
because
they
wandered
from
village
to
village
kappa
alpha
tau
alpha
kappa
omega
mu
alpha
sigma
being
excluded
contemptuously
from
the
city
they
add
also
that
the
dorian
word
for
is
delta
rho
alpha
nu
and
the
athenian
pi
rho
alpha
tau
tau
epsilon
iota
nu
this
may
suffice
as
to
the
number
and
nature
of
the
various
modes
of
imitation
iv
poetry
in
general
seems
to
have
sprung
from
two
causes
each
of
them
lying
deep
in
our
nature
first
the
instinct
of
imitation
is
implanted
in
man
from
childhood
one
difference
between
him
and
other
animals
being
that
he
is
the
most
imitative
of
living
creatures
and
through
imitation
learns
his
earliest
lessons
and
no
less
universal
is
the
pleasure
felt
in
things
imitated
we
have
evidence
of
this
in
the
facts
of
experience
objects
which
in
themselves
we
view
with
pain
we
delight
to
contemplate
when
reproduced
with
minute
fidelity
such
as
the
forms
of
the
most
ignoble
animals
and
of
dead
bodies
the
cause
of
this
again
is
that
to
learn
gives
the
liveliest
pleasure
not
only
to
philosophers
but
to
men
in
general
whose
capacity
however
of
learning
is
more
limited
thus
the
reason
why
men
enjoy
seeing
a
likeness
is
that
in
contemplating
it
they
find
themselves
learning
or
inferring
and
saying
perhaps
that
is
he
for
if
you
happen
not
to
have
seen
the
original
the
pleasure
will
be
due
not
to
the
imitation
as
such
but
to
the
execution
the
colouring
or
some
such
other
cause
imitation
then
is
one
instinct
of
our
nature
next
there
is
the
instinct
for
and
rhythm
metres
being
manifestly
sections
of
rhythm
persons
therefore
starting
with
this
natural
gift
developed
by
degrees
their
special
aptitudes
till
their
rude
improvisations
gave
birth
to
poetry
poetry
now
diverged
in
two
directions
according
to
the
individual
character
of
the
writers
the
graver
spirits
imitated
noble
actions
and
the
actions
of
good
men
the
more
trivial
sort
imitated
the
actions
of
meaner
persons
at
first
composing
satires
as
the
former
did
hymns
to
the
gods
and
the
praises
of
famous
men
a
poem
of
the
satirical
kind
can
not
indeed
be
put
down
to
any
author
earlier
than
homer
though
many
such
writers
probably
there
were
but
from
homer
onward
instances
can
be
cited
his
own
margites
for
example
and
other
similar
compositions
the
appropriate
metre
was
also
here
introduced
hence
the
measure
is
still
called
the
iambic
or
lampooning
measure
being
that
in
which
people
lampooned
one
another
thus
the
older
poets
were
distinguished
as
writers
of
heroic
or
of
lampooning
verse
as
in
the
serious
style
homer
is
among
poets
for
he
alone
combined
dramatic
form
with
excellence
of
imitation
so
he
too
first
laid
down
the
main
lines
of
comedy
by
dramatising
the
ludicrous
instead
of
writing
personal
satire
his
margites
bears
the
same
relation
to
comedy
that
the
iliad
and
odyssey
do
to
tragedy
but
when
tragedy
and
comedy
came
to
light
the
two
classes
of
poets
still
followed
their
natural
bent
the
lampooners
became
writers
of
comedy
and
the
epic
poets
were
succeeded
by
tragedians
since
the
drama
was
a
larger
and
higher
form
of
art
whether
tragedy
has
as
yet
perfected
its
proper
types
or
not
and
whether
it
is
to
be
judged
in
itself
or
in
relation
also
to
the
audience
this
raises
another
question
be
that
as
it
may
tragedy
as
also
comedy
was
at
first
mere
improvisation
the
one
originated
with
the
authors
of
the
dithyramb
the
other
with
those
of
the
phallic
songs
which
are
still
in
use
in
many
of
our
cities
tragedy
advanced
by
slow
degrees
each
new
element
that
showed
itself
was
in
turn
developed
having
passed
through
many
changes
it
found
its
natural
form
and
there
it
stopped
aeschylus
first
introduced
a
second
actor
he
diminished
the
importance
of
the
chorus
and
assigned
the
leading
part
to
the
dialogue
sophocles
raised
the
number
of
actors
to
three
and
added
moreover
it
was
not
till
late
that
the
short
plot
was
discarded
for
one
of
greater
compass
and
the
grotesque
diction
of
the
earlier
satyric
form
for
the
stately
manner
of
tragedy
the
iambic
measure
then
replaced
the
trochaic
tetrameter
which
was
originally
employed
when
the
poetry
was
of
the
satyric
order
and
had
greater
affinities
with
dancing
once
dialogue
had
come
in
nature
herself
discovered
the
appropriate
measure
for
the
iambic
is
of
all
measures
the
most
colloquial
we
see
it
in
the
fact
that
conversational
speech
runs
into
iambic
lines
more
frequently
than
into
any
other
kind
of
verse
rarely
into
hexameters
and
only
when
we
drop
the
colloquial
intonation
the
additions
to
the
number
of
or
acts
and
the
other
accessories
of
which
tradition
tells
must
be
taken
as
already
described
for
to
discuss
them
in
detail
would
doubtless
be
a
large
undertaking
v
comedy
is
as
we
have
said
an
imitation
of
characters
of
a
lower
type
not
however
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
bad
the
ludicrous
being
merely
a
subdivision
of
the
ugly
it
consists
in
some
defect
or
ugliness
which
is
not
painful
or
destructive
to
take
an
obvious
example
the
comic
mask
is
ugly
and
distorted
but
does
not
imply
pain
the
successive
changes
through
which
tragedy
passed
and
the
authors
of
these
changes
are
well
known
whereas
comedy
has
had
no
history
because
it
was
not
at
first
treated
seriously
it
was
late
before
the
archon
granted
a
comic
chorus
to
a
poet
the
performers
were
till
then
voluntary
comedy
had
already
taken
definite
shape
when
comic
poets
distinctively
so
called
are
heard
of
who
furnished
it
with
masks
or
prologues
or
increased
the
number
of
actors
these
and
other
similar
details
remain
unknown
as
for
the
plot
it
came
originally
from
sicily
but
of
athenian
writers
crates
was
the
first
who
abandoning
the
or
lampooning
form
generalised
his
themes
and
plots
epic
poetry
agrees
with
tragedy
in
so
far
as
it
is
an
imitation
in
verse
of
characters
of
a
higher
type
they
differ
in
that
epic
poetry
admits
but
one
kind
of
metre
and
is
narrative
in
form
they
differ
again
in
their
length
for
tragedy
endeavours
as
far
as
possible
to
confine
itself
to
a
single
revolution
of
the
sun
or
but
slightly
to
exceed
this
limit
whereas
the
epic
action
has
no
limits
of
time
this
then
is
a
second
point
of
difference
though
at
first
the
same
freedom
was
admitted
in
tragedy
as
in
epic
poetry
of
their
constituent
parts
some
are
common
to
both
some
peculiar
to
tragedy
whoever
therefore
knows
what
is
good
or
bad
tragedy
knows
also
about
epic
poetry
all
the
elements
of
an
epic
poem
are
found
in
tragedy
but
the
elements
of
a
tragedy
are
not
all
found
in
the
epic
poem
vi
of
the
poetry
which
imitates
in
hexameter
verse
and
of
comedy
we
will
speak
hereafter
let
us
now
discuss
tragedy
resuming
its
formal
definition
as
resulting
from
what
has
been
already
said
tragedy
then
is
an
imitation
of
an
action
that
is
serious
complete
and
of
a
certain
magnitude
in
language
embellished
with
each
kind
of
artistic
ornament
the
several
kinds
being
found
in
separate
parts
of
the
play
in
the
form
of
action
not
of
narrative
through
pity
and
fear
effecting
the
proper
purgation
of
these
emotions
by
embellished
i
mean
language
into
which
rhythm
and
song
enter
by
several
kinds
in
separate
parts
i
mean
that
some
parts
are
rendered
through
the
medium
of
verse
alone
others
again
with
the
aid
of
song
now
as
tragic
imitation
implies
persons
acting
it
necessarily
follows
in
the
first
place
that
spectacular
equipment
will
be
a
part
of
tragedy
next
song
and
diction
for
these
are
the
medium
of
imitation
by
i
mean
the
mere
metrical
arrangement
of
the
words
as
for
it
is
a
term
whose
sense
every
one
understands
again
tragedy
is
the
imitation
of
an
action
and
an
action
implies
personal
agents
who
necessarily
possess
certain
distinctive
qualities
both
of
character
and
thought
for
it
is
by
these
that
we
qualify
actions
themselves
and
these
thought
and
character
are
the
two
natural
causes
from
which
actions
spring
and
on
actions
again
all
success
or
failure
depends
hence
the
plot
is
the
imitation
of
the
action
for
by
plot
i
here
mean
the
arrangement
of
the
incidents
by
character
i
mean
that
in
virtue
of
which
we
ascribe
certain
qualities
to
the
agents
thought
is
required
wherever
a
statement
is
proved
or
it
may
be
a
general
truth
enunciated
every
tragedy
therefore
must
have
six
parts
which
parts
determine
its
quality
namely
plot
character
diction
thought
spectacle
song
two
of
the
parts
constitute
the
medium
of
imitation
one
the
manner
and
three
the
objects
of
imitation
and
these
complete
the
list
these
elements
have
been
employed
we
may
say
by
the
poets
to
a
man
in
fact
every
play
contains
spectacular
elements
as
well
as
character
plot
diction
song
and
thought
but
most
important
of
all
is
the
structure
of
the
incidents
for
tragedy
is
an
imitation
not
of
men
but
of
an
action
and
of
life
and
life
consists
in
action
and
its
end
is
a
mode
of
action
not
a
quality
now
character
determines
men
qualities
but
it
is
by
their
actions
that
they
are
happy
or
the
reverse
dramatic
action
therefore
is
not
with
a
view
to
the
representation
of
character
character
comes
in
as
subsidiary
to
the
actions
hence
the
incidents
and
the
plot
are
the
end
of
a
tragedy
and
the
end
is
the
chief
thing
of
all
again
without
action
there
can
not
be
a
tragedy
there
may
be
without
character
the
tragedies
of
most
of
our
modern
poets
fail
in
the
rendering
of
character
and
of
poets
in
general
this
is
often
true
it
is
the
same
in
painting
and
here
lies
the
difference
between
zeuxis
and
polygnotus
polygnotus
delineates
character
well
the
style
of
zeuxis
is
devoid
of
ethical
quality
again
if
you
string
together
a
set
of
speeches
expressive
of
character
and
well
finished
in
point
of
diction
and
thought
you
will
not
produce
the
essential
tragic
effect
nearly
so
well
as
with
a
play
which
however
deficient
in
these
respects
yet
has
a
plot
and
artistically
constructed
incidents
besides
which
the
most
powerful
elements
of
emotional
interest
in
tragedy
peripeteia
or
reversal
of
the
situation
and
recognition
scenes
are
parts
of
the
plot
a
further
proof
is
that
novices
in
the
art
attain
to
finish
of
diction
and
precision
of
portraiture
before
they
can
construct
the
plot
it
is
the
same
with
almost
all
the
early
poets
the
plot
then
is
the
first
principle
and
as
it
were
the
soul
of
a
tragedy
character
holds
the
second
place
a
similar
fact
is
seen
in
painting
the
most
beautiful
colours
laid
on
confusedly
will
not
give
as
much
pleasure
as
the
chalk
outline
of
a
portrait
thus
tragedy
is
the
imitation
of
an
action
and
of
the
agents
mainly
with
a
view
to
the
action
third
in
order
is
thought
that
is
the
faculty
of
saying
what
is
possible
and
pertinent
in
given
circumstances
in
the
case
of
oratory
this
is
the
function
of
the
political
art
and
of
the
art
of
rhetoric
and
so
indeed
the
older
poets
make
their
characters
speak
the
language
of
civic
life
the
poets
of
our
time
the
language
of
the
rhetoricians
character
is
that
which
reveals
moral
purpose
showing
what
kind
of
things
a
man
chooses
or
avoids
speeches
therefore
which
do
not
make
this
manifest
or
in
which
the
speaker
does
not
choose
or
avoid
anything
whatever
are
not
expressive
of
character
thought
on
the
other
hand
is
found
where
something
is
proved
to
be
or
not
to
be
or
a
general
maxim
is
enunciated
fourth
among
the
elements
enumerated
comes
diction
by
which
i
mean
as
has
been
already
said
the
expression
of
the
meaning
in
words
and
its
essence
is
the
same
both
in
verse
and
prose
of
the
remaining
elements
song
holds
the
chief
place
among
the
embellishments
the
spectacle
has
indeed
an
emotional
attraction
of
its
own
but
of
all
the
parts
it
is
the
least
artistic
and
connected
least
with
the
art
of
poetry
for
the
power
of
tragedy
we
may
be
sure
is
felt
even
apart
from
representation
and
actors
besides
the
production
of
spectacular
effects
depends
more
on
the
art
of
the
stage
machinist
than
on
that
of
the
poet
vii
these
principles
being
established
let
us
now
discuss
the
proper
structure
of
the
plot
since
this
is
the
first
and
most
important
thing
in
tragedy
now
according
to
our
definition
tragedy
is
an
imitation
of
an
action
that
is
complete
and
whole
and
of
a
certain
magnitude
for
there
may
be
a
whole
that
is
wanting
in
magnitude
a
whole
is
that
which
has
a
beginning
a
middle
and
an
end
a
beginning
is
that
which
does
not
itself
follow
anything
by
causal
necessity
but
after
which
something
naturally
is
or
comes
to
be
an
end
on
the
contrary
is
that
which
itself
naturally
follows
some
other
thing
either
by
necessity
or
as
a
rule
but
has
nothing
following
it
a
middle
is
that
which
follows
something
as
some
other
thing
follows
it
a
well
constructed
plot
therefore
must
neither
begin
nor
end
at
haphazard
but
conform
to
these
principles
again
a
beautiful
object
whether
it
be
a
living
organism
or
any
whole
composed
of
parts
must
not
only
have
an
orderly
arrangement
of
parts
but
must
also
be
of
a
certain
magnitude
for
beauty
depends
on
magnitude
and
order
hence
a
very
small
animal
organism
can
not
be
beautiful
for
the
view
of
it
is
confused
the
object
being
seen
in
an
almost
imperceptible
moment
of
time
nor
again
can
one
of
vast
size
be
beautiful
for
as
the
eye
can
not
take
it
all
in
at
once
the
unity
and
sense
of
the
whole
is
lost
for
the
spectator
as
for
instance
if
there
were
one
a
thousand
miles
long
as
therefore
in
the
case
of
animate
bodies
and
organisms
a
certain
magnitude
is
necessary
and
a
magnitude
which
may
be
easily
embraced
in
one
view
so
in
the
plot
a
certain
length
is
necessary
and
a
length
which
can
be
easily
embraced
by
the
memory
the
limit
of
length
in
relation
to
dramatic
competition
and
sensuous
presentment
is
no
part
of
artistic
theory
for
had
it
been
the
rule
for
a
hundred
tragedies
to
compete
together
the
performance
would
have
been
regulated
by
the
as
indeed
we
are
told
was
formerly
done
but
the
limit
as
fixed
by
the
nature
of
the
drama
itself
is
this
the
greater
the
length
the
more
beautiful
will
the
piece
be
by
reason
of
its
size
provided
that
the
whole
be
perspicuous
and
to
define
the
matter
roughly
we
may
say
that
the
proper
magnitude
is
comprised
within
such
limits
that
the
sequence
of
events
according
to
the
law
of
probability
or
necessity
will
admit
of
a
change
from
bad
fortune
to
good
or
from
good
fortune
to
bad
viii
unity
of
plot
does
not
as
some
persons
think
consist
in
the
unity
of
the
hero
for
infinitely
various
are
the
incidents
in
one
man
life
which
can
not
be
reduced
to
unity
and
so
too
there
are
many
actions
of
one
man
out
of
which
we
can
not
make
one
action
hence
the
error
as
it
appears
of
all
poets
who
have
composed
a
heracleid
a
theseid
or
other
poems
of
the
kind
they
imagine
that
as
heracles
was
one
man
the
story
of
heracles
must
also
be
a
unity
but
homer
as
in
all
else
he
is
of
surpassing
merit
here
too
whether
from
art
or
natural
genius
seems
to
have
happily
discerned
the
truth
in
composing
the
odyssey
he
did
not
include
all
the
adventures
of
odysseus
such
as
his
wound
on
parnassus
or
his
feigned
madness
at
the
mustering
of
the
host
incidents
between
which
there
was
no
necessary
or
probable
connection
but
he
made
the
odyssey
and
likewise
the
iliad
to
centre
round
an
action
that
in
our
sense
of
the
word
is
one
as
therefore
in
the
other
imitative
arts
the
imitation
is
one
when
the
object
imitated
is
one
so
the
plot
being
an
imitation
of
an
action
must
imitate
one
action
and
that
a
whole
the
structural
union
of
the
parts
being
such
that
if
any
one
of
them
is
displaced
or
removed
the
whole
will
be
disjointed
and
disturbed
for
a
thing
whose
presence
or
absence
makes
no
visible
difference
is
not
an
organic
part
of
the
whole
ix
it
is
moreover
evident
from
what
has
been
said
that
it
is
not
the
function
of
the
poet
to
relate
what
has
happened
but
what
may
happen
what
is
possible
according
to
the
law
of
probability
or
necessity
the
poet
and
the
historian
differ
not
by
writing
in
verse
or
in
prose
the
work
of
herodotus
might
be
put
into
verse
and
it
would
still
be
a
species
of
history
with
metre
no
less
than
without
it
the
true
difference
is
that
one
relates
what
has
happened
the
other
what
may
happen
poetry
therefore
is
a
more
philosophical
and
a
higher
thing
than
history
for
poetry
tends
to
express
the
universal
history
the
particular
by
the
universal
i
mean
how
a
person
of
a
certain
type
will
on
occasion
speak
or
act
according
to
the
law
of
probability
or
necessity
and
it
is
this
universality
at
which
poetry
aims
in
the
names
she
attaches
to
the
personages
the
particular
is
for
example
what
alcibiades
did
or
suffered
in
comedy
this
is
already
apparent
for
here
the
poet
first
constructs
the
plot
on
the
lines
of
probability
and
then
inserts
characteristic
names
unlike
the
lampooners
who
write
about
particular
individuals
but
tragedians
still
keep
to
real
names
the
reason
being
that
what
is
possible
is
credible
what
has
not
happened
we
do
not
at
once
feel
sure
to
be
possible
but
what
has
happened
is
manifestly
possible
otherwise
it
would
not
have
happened
still
there
are
even
some
tragedies
in
which
there
are
only
one
or
two
well
known
names
the
rest
being
fictitious
in
others
none
are
well
known
as
in
agathon
antheus
where
incidents
and
names
alike
are
fictitious
and
yet
they
give
none
the
less
pleasure
we
must
not
therefore
at
all
costs
keep
to
the
received
legends
which
are
the
usual
subjects
of
tragedy
indeed
it
would
be
absurd
to
attempt
it
for
even
subjects
that
are
known
are
known
only
to
a
few
and
yet
give
pleasure
to
all
it
clearly
follows
that
the
poet
or
should
be
the
maker
of
plots
rather
than
of
verses
since
he
is
a
poet
because
he
imitates
and
what
he
imitates
are
actions
and
even
if
he
chances
to
take
an
historical
subject
he
is
none
the
less
a
poet
for
there
is
no
reason
why
some
events
that
have
actually
happened
should
not
conform
to
the
law
of
the
probable
and
possible
and
in
virtue
of
that
quality
in
them
he
is
their
poet
or
maker
of
all
plots
and
actions
the
epeisodic
are
the
worst
i
call
a
plot
in
which
the
episodes
or
acts
succeed
one
another
without
probable
or
necessary
sequence
bad
poets
compose
such
pieces
by
their
own
fault
good
poets
to
please
the
players
for
as
they
write
show
pieces
for
competition
they
stretch
the
plot
beyond
its
capacity
and
are
often
forced
to
break
the
natural
continuity
but
again
tragedy
is
an
imitation
not
only
of
a
complete
action
but
of
events
inspiring
fear
or
pity
such
an
effect
is
best
produced
when
the
events
come
on
us
by
surprise
and
the
effect
is
heightened
when
at
the
same
time
they
follow
as
cause
and
effect
the
tragic
wonder
will
thee
be
greater
than
if
they
happened
of
themselves
or
by
accident
for
even
coincidences
are
most
striking
when
they
have
an
air
of
design
we
may
instance
the
statue
of
mitys
at
argos
which
fell
upon
his
murderer
while
he
was
a
spectator
at
a
festival
and
killed
him
such
events
seem
not
to
be
due
to
mere
chance
plots
therefore
constructed
on
these
principles
are
necessarily
the
best
x
plots
are
either
simple
or
complex
for
the
actions
in
real
life
of
which
the
plots
are
an
imitation
obviously
show
a
similar
distinction
an
action
which
is
one
and
continuous
in
the
sense
above
defined
i
call
simple
when
the
change
of
fortune
takes
place
without
reversal
of
the
situation
and
without
recognition
a
complex
action
is
one
in
which
the
change
is
accompanied
by
such
reversal
or
by
recognition
or
by
both
these
last
should
arise
from
the
internal
structure
of
the
plot
so
that
what
follows
should
be
the
necessary
or
probable
result
of
the
preceding
action
it
makes
all
the
difference
whether
any
given
event
is
a
case
of
propter
hoc
or
post
hoc
xi
reversal
of
the
situation
is
a
change
by
which
the
action
veers
round
to
its
opposite
subject
always
to
our
rule
of
probability
or
necessity
thus
in
the
oedipus
the
messenger
comes
to
cheer
oedipus
and
free
him
from
his
alarms
about
his
mother
but
by
revealing
who
he
is
he
produces
the
opposite
effect
again
in
the
lynceus
lynceus
is
being
led
away
to
his
death
and
danaus
goes
with
him
meaning
to
slay
him
but
the
outcome
of
the
preceding
incidents
is
that
danaus
is
killed
and
lynceus
saved
recognition
as
the
name
indicates
is
a
change
from
ignorance
to
knowledge
producing
love
or
hate
between
the
persons
destined
by
the
poet
for
good
or
bad
fortune
the
best
form
of
recognition
is
coincident
with
a
reversal
of
the
situation
as
in
the
oedipus
there
are
indeed
other
forms
even
inanimate
things
of
the
most
trivial
kind
may
in
a
sense
be
objects
of
recognition
again
we
may
recognise
or
discover
whether
a
person
has
done
a
thing
or
not
but
the
recognition
which
is
most
intimately
connected
with
the
plot
and
action
is
as
we
have
said
the
recognition
of
persons
this
recognition
combined
with
reversal
will
produce
either
pity
or
fear
and
actions
producing
these
effects
are
those
which
by
our
definition
tragedy
represents
moreover
it
is
upon
such
situations
that
the
issues
of
good
or
bad
fortune
will
depend
recognition
then
being
between
persons
it
may
happen
that
one
person
only
is
recognised
by
the
the
latter
is
already
known
or
it
may
be
necessary
that
the
recognition
should
be
on
both
sides
thus
iphigenia
is
revealed
to
orestes
by
the
sending
of
the
letter
but
another
act
of
recognition
is
required
to
make
orestes
known
to
iphigenia
two
parts
then
of
the
plot
reversal
of
the
situation
and
recognition
turn
upon
surprises
a
third
part
is
the
scene
of
suffering
the
scene
of
suffering
is
a
destructive
or
painful
action
such
as
death
on
the
stage
bodily
agony
wounds
and
the
like
xii
the
parts
of
tragedy
which
must
be
treated
as
elements
of
the
whole
have
been
already
mentioned
we
now
come
to
the
quantitative
parts
and
the
separate
parts
into
which
tragedy
is
divided
namely
prologue
episode
exode
choric
song
this
last
being
divided
into
parode
and
stasimon
these
are
common
to
all
plays
peculiar
to
some
are
the
songs
of
actors
from
the
stage
and
the
commoi
the
prologue
is
that
entire
part
of
a
tragedy
which
precedes
the
parode
of
the
chorus
the
episode
is
that
entire
part
of
a
tragedy
which
is
between
complete
choric
songs
the
exode
is
that
entire
part
of
a
tragedy
which
has
no
choric
song
after
it
of
the
choric
part
the
parode
is
the
first
undivided
utterance
of
the
chorus
the
stasimon
is
a
choric
ode
without
anapaests
or
trochaic
tetrameters
the
commos
is
a
joint
lamentation
of
chorus
and
actors
the
parts
of
tragedy
which
must
be
treated
as
elements
of
the
whole
have
been
already
mentioned
the
quantitative
parts
the
separate
parts
into
which
it
is
divided
are
here
enumerated
xiii
as
the
sequel
to
what
has
already
been
said
we
must
proceed
to
consider
what
the
poet
should
aim
at
and
what
he
should
avoid
in
constructing
his
plots
and
by
what
means
the
specific
effect
of
tragedy
will
be
produced
a
perfect
tragedy
should
as
we
have
seen
be
arranged
not
on
the
simple
but
on
the
complex
plan
it
should
moreover
imitate
actions
which
excite
pity
and
fear
this
being
the
distinctive
mark
of
tragic
imitation
it
follows
plainly
in
the
first
place
that
the
change
of
fortune
presented
must
not
be
the
spectacle
of
a
virtuous
man
brought
from
prosperity
to
adversity
for
this
moves
neither
pity
nor
fear
it
merely
shocks
us
nor
again
that
of
a
bad
man
passing
from
adversity
to
prosperity
for
nothing
can
be
more
alien
to
the
spirit
of
tragedy
it
possesses
no
single
tragic
quality
it
neither
satisfies
the
moral
sense
nor
calls
forth
pity
or
fear
nor
again
should
the
downfall
of
the
utter
villain
be
exhibited
a
plot
of
this
kind
would
doubtless
satisfy
the
moral
sense
but
it
would
inspire
neither
pity
nor
fear
for
pity
is
aroused
by
unmerited
misfortune
fear
by
the
misfortune
of
a
man
like
ourselves
such
an
event
therefore
will
be
neither
pitiful
nor
terrible
there
remains
then
the
character
between
these
two
extremes
that
of
a
man
who
is
not
eminently
good
and
just
whose
misfortune
is
brought
about
not
by
vice
or
depravity
but
by
some
error
or
frailty
he
must
be
one
who
is
highly
renowned
and
prosperous
a
personage
like
oedipus
thyestes
or
other
illustrious
men
of
such
families
a
well
constructed
plot
should
therefore
be
single
in
its
issue
rather
than
double
as
some
maintain
the
change
of
fortune
should
be
not
from
bad
to
good
but
reversely
from
good
to
bad
it
should
come
about
as
the
result
not
of
vice
but
of
some
great
error
or
frailty
in
a
character
either
such
as
we
have
described
or
better
rather
than
worse
the
practice
of
the
stage
bears
out
our
view
at
first
the
poets
recounted
any
legend
that
came
in
their
way
now
the
best
tragedies
are
founded
on
the
story
of
a
few
houses
on
the
fortunes
of
alcmaeon
oedipus
orestes
meleager
thyestes
telephus
and
those
others
who
have
done
or
suffered
something
terrible
a
tragedy
then
to
be
perfect
according
to
the
rules
of
art
should
be
of
this
construction
hence
they
are
in
error
who
censure
euripides
just
because
he
follows
this
principle
in
his
plays
many
of
which
end
unhappily
it
is
as
we
have
said
the
right
ending
the
best
proof
is
that
on
the
stage
and
in
dramatic
competition
such
plays
if
well
worked
out
are
the
most
tragic
in
effect
and
euripides
faulty
though
he
may
be
in
the
general
management
of
his
subject
yet
is
felt
to
be
the
most
tragic
of
the
poets
in
the
second
rank
comes
the
kind
of
tragedy
which
some
place
first
like
the
odyssey
it
has
a
double
thread
of
plot
and
also
an
opposite
catastrophe
for
the
good
and
for
the
bad
it
is
accounted
the
best
because
of
the
weakness
of
the
spectators
for
the
poet
is
guided
in
what
he
writes
by
the
wishes
of
his
audience
the
pleasure
however
thence
derived
is
not
the
true
tragic
pleasure
it
is
proper
rather
to
comedy
where
those
who
in
the
piece
are
the
deadliest
enemies
like
orestes
and
aegisthus
quit
the
stage
as
friends
at
the
close
and
no
one
slays
or
is
slain
xiv
fear
and
pity
may
be
aroused
by
spectacular
means
but
they
may
also
result
from
the
inner
structure
of
the
piece
which
is
the
better
way
and
indicates
a
superior
poet
for
the
plot
ought
to
be
so
constructed
that
even
without
the
aid
of
the
eye
he
who
hears
the
tale
told
will
thrill
with
horror
and
melt
to
pity
at
what
takes
place
this
is
the
impression
we
should
receive
from
hearing
the
story
of
the
oedipus
but
to
produce
this
effect
by
the
mere
spectacle
is
a
less
artistic
method
and
dependent
on
extraneous
aids
those
who
employ
spectacular
means
to
create
a
sense
not
of
the
terrible
but
only
of
the
monstrous
are
strangers
to
the
purpose
of
tragedy
for
we
must
not
demand
of
tragedy
any
and
every
kind
of
pleasure
but
only
that
which
is
proper
to
it
and
since
the
pleasure
which
the
poet
should
afford
is
that
which
comes
from
pity
and
fear
through
imitation
it
is
evident
that
this
quality
must
be
impressed
upon
the
incidents
let
us
then
determine
what
are
the
circumstances
which
strike
us
as
terrible
or
pitiful
actions
capable
of
this
effect
must
happen
between
persons
who
are
either
friends
or
enemies
or
indifferent
to
one
another
if
an
enemy
kills
an
enemy
there
is
nothing
to
excite
pity
either
in
the
act
or
the
intention
except
so
far
as
the
suffering
in
itself
is
pitiful
so
again
with
indifferent
persons
but
when
the
tragic
incident
occurs
between
those
who
are
near
or
dear
to
one
another
if
for
example
a
brother
kills
or
intends
to
kill
a
brother
a
son
his
father
a
mother
her
son
a
son
his
mother
or
any
other
deed
of
the
kind
is
done
these
are
the
situations
to
be
looked
for
by
the
poet
he
may
not
indeed
destroy
the
framework
of
the
received
legends
the
fact
for
instance
that
clytemnestra
was
slain
by
orestes
and
eriphyle
by
alcmaeon
but
he
ought
to
show
invention
of
his
own
and
skilfully
handle
the
traditional
material
let
us
explain
more
clearly
what
is
meant
by
skilful
handling
the
action
may
be
done
consciously
and
with
knowledge
of
the
persons
in
the
manner
of
the
older
poets
it
is
thus
too
that
euripides
makes
medea
slay
her
children
or
again
the
deed
of
horror
may
be
done
but
done
in
ignorance
and
the
tie
of
kinship
or
friendship
be
discovered
afterwards
the
oedipus
of
sophocles
is
an
example
here
indeed
the
incident
is
outside
the
drama
proper
but
cases
occur
where
it
falls
within
the
action
of
the
play
one
may
cite
the
alcmaeon
of
astydamas
or
telegonus
in
the
wounded
odysseus
again
there
is
a
third
case
to
be
about
to
act
with
knowledge
of
the
persons
and
then
not
to
act
the
fourth
case
is
when
some
one
is
about
to
do
an
irreparable
deed
through
ignorance
and
makes
the
discovery
before
it
is
done
these
are
the
only
possible
ways
for
the
deed
must
either
be
done
or
not
done
and
that
wittingly
or
unwittingly
but
of
all
these
ways
to
be
about
to
act
knowing
the
persons
and
then
not
to
act
is
the
worst
it
is
shocking
without
being
tragic
for
no
disaster
follows
it
is
therefore
never
or
very
rarely
found
in
poetry
one
instance
however
is
in
the
antigone
where
haemon
threatens
to
kill
creon
the
next
and
better
way
is
that
the
deed
should
be
perpetrated
still
better
that
it
should
be
perpetrated
in
ignorance
and
the
discovery
made
afterwards
there
is
then
nothing
to
shock
us
while
the
discovery
produces
a
startling
effect
the
last
case
is
the
best
as
when
in
the
cresphontes
merope
is
about
to
slay
her
son
but
recognising
who
he
is
spares
his
life
so
in
the
iphigenia
the
sister
recognises
the
brother
just
in
time
again
in
the
helle
the
son
recognises
the
mother
when
on
the
point
of
giving
her
up
this
then
is
why
a
few
families
only
as
has
been
already
observed
furnish
the
subjects
of
tragedy
it
was
not
art
but
happy
chance
that
led
the
poets
in
search
of
subjects
to
impress
the
tragic
quality
upon
their
plots
they
are
compelled
therefore
to
have
recourse
to
those
houses
whose
history
contains
moving
incidents
like
these
enough
has
now
been
said
concerning
the
structure
of
the
incidents
and
the
right
kind
of
plot
xv
in
respect
of
character
there
are
four
things
to
be
aimed
at
first
and
most
important
it
must
be
good
now
any
speech
or
action
that
manifests
moral
purpose
of
any
kind
will
be
expressive
of
character
the
character
will
be
good
if
the
purpose
is
good
this
rule
is
relative
to
each
class
even
a
woman
may
be
good
and
also
a
slave
though
the
woman
may
be
said
to
be
an
inferior
being
and
the
slave
quite
worthless
the
second
thing
to
aim
at
is
propriety
there
is
a
type
of
manly
valour
but
valour
in
a
woman
or
unscrupulous
cleverness
is
inappropriate
thirdly
character
must
be
true
to
life
for
this
is
a
distinct
thing
from
goodness
and
propriety
as
here
described
the
fourth
point
is
consistency
for
though
the
subject
of
the
imitation
who
suggested
the
type
be
inconsistent
still
he
must
be
consistently
inconsistent
as
an
example
of
motiveless
degradation
of
character
we
have
menelaus
in
the
orestes
of
character
indecorous
and
inappropriate
the
lament
of
odysseus
in
the
scylla
and
the
speech
of
melanippe
of
inconsistency
the
iphigenia
at
aulis
for
iphigenia
the
suppliant
in
no
way
resembles
her
later
self
as
in
the
structure
of
the
plot
so
too
in
the
portraiture
of
character
the
poet
should
always
aim
either
at
the
necessary
or
the
probable
thus
a
person
of
a
given
character
should
speak
or
act
in
a
given
way
by
the
rule
either
of
necessity
or
of
probability
just
as
this
event
should
follow
that
by
necessary
or
probable
sequence
it
is
therefore
evident
that
the
unravelling
of
the
plot
no
less
than
the
complication
must
arise
out
of
the
plot
itself
it
must
not
be
brought
about
by
the
ex
machina
as
in
the
medea
or
in
the
return
of
the
greeks
in
the
iliad
the
ex
machina
should
be
employed
only
for
events
external
to
the
drama
for
antecedent
or
subsequent
events
which
lie
beyond
the
range
of
human
knowledge
and
which
require
to
be
reported
or
foretold
for
to
the
gods
we
ascribe
the
power
of
seeing
all
things
within
the
action
there
must
be
nothing
irrational
if
the
irrational
can
not
be
excluded
it
should
be
outside
the
scope
of
the
tragedy
such
is
the
irrational
element
in
the
oedipus
of
sophocles
again
since
tragedy
is
an
imitation
of
persons
who
are
above
the
common
level
the
example
of
good
should
be
followed
they
while
reproducing
the
distinctive
form
of
the
original
make
a
likeness
which
is
true
to
life
and
yet
more
beautiful
so
too
the
poet
in
representing
men
who
are
irascible
or
indolent
or
have
other
defects
of
character
should
preserve
the
type
and
yet
ennoble
it
in
this
way
achilles
is
portrayed
by
agathon
and
homer
these
then
are
rules
the
poet
should
observe
nor
should
he
neglect
those
appeals
to
the
senses
which
though
not
among
the
essentials
are
the
concomitants
of
poetry
for
here
too
there
is
much
room
for
error
but
of
this
enough
has
been
said
in
our
published
treatises
xvi
what
recognition
is
has
been
already
explained
we
will
now
enumerate
its
kinds
first
the
least
artistic
form
which
from
poverty
of
wit
is
most
commonly
employed
recognition
by
signs
of
these
some
are
congenital
such
as
spear
which
the
race
bear
on
their
bodies
or
the
stars
introduced
by
carcinus
in
his
thyestes
others
are
acquired
after
birth
and
of
these
some
are
bodily
marks
as
scars
some
external
tokens
as
necklaces
or
the
little
ark
in
the
tyro
by
which
the
discovery
is
effected
even
these
admit
of
more
or
less
skilful
treatment
thus
in
the
recognition
of
odysseus
by
his
scar
the
discovery
is
made
in
one
way
by
the
nurse
in
another
by
the
swineherds
the
use
of
tokens
for
the
express
purpose
of
proof
and
indeed
any
formal
proof
with
or
without
tokens
is
a
less
artistic
mode
of
recognition
a
better
kind
is
that
which
comes
about
by
a
turn
of
incident
as
in
the
bath
scene
in
the
odyssey
next
come
the
recognitions
invented
at
will
by
the
poet
and
on
that
account
wanting
in
art
for
example
orestes
in
the
iphigenia
reveals
the
fact
that
he
is
orestes
she
indeed
makes
herself
known
by
the
letter
but
he
by
speaking
himself
and
saying
what
the
poet
not
what
the
plot
requires
this
therefore
is
nearly
allied
to
the
fault
above
mentioned
for
orestes
might
as
well
have
brought
tokens
with
him
another
similar
instance
is
the
of
the
shuttle
in
the
tereus
of
sophocles
the
third
kind
depends
on
memory
when
the
sight
of
some
object
awakens
a
feeling
as
in
the
cyprians
of
dicaeogenes
where
the
hero
breaks
into
tears
on
seeing
the
picture
or
again
in
the
of
alcinous
where
odysseus
hearing
the
minstrel
play
the
lyre
recalls
the
past
and
weeps
and
hence
the
recognition
the
fourth
kind
is
by
process
of
reasoning
thus
in
the
choephori
one
resembling
me
has
come
no
one
resembles
me
but
orestes
therefore
orestes
has
come
such
too
is
the
discovery
made
by
iphigenia
in
the
play
of
polyidus
the
sophist
it
was
a
natural
reflection
for
orestes
to
make
i
too
must
die
at
the
altar
like
my
sister
so
again
in
the
tydeus
of
theodectes
the
father
says
came
to
find
my
son
and
i
lose
my
own
life
so
too
in
the
phineidae
the
women
on
seeing
the
place
inferred
their
fate
we
are
doomed
to
die
for
here
we
were
cast
forth
again
there
is
a
composite
kind
of
recognition
involving
false
inference
on
the
part
of
one
of
the
characters
as
in
the
odysseus
disguised
as
a
messenger
a
said
that
no
one
else
was
able
to
bend
the
bow
hence
b
the
disguised
odysseus
imagined
that
a
would
recognise
the
bow
which
in
fact
he
had
not
seen
and
to
bring
about
a
recognition
by
this
means
that
the
expectation
a
would
recognise
the
bow
is
false
inference
but
of
all
recognitions
the
best
is
that
which
arises
from
the
incidents
themselves
where
the
startling
discovery
is
made
by
natural
means
such
is
that
in
the
oedipus
of
sophocles
and
in
the
iphigenia
for
it
was
natural
that
iphigenia
should
wish
to
dispatch
a
letter
these
recognitions
alone
dispense
with
the
artificial
aid
of
tokens
or
amulets
next
come
the
recognitions
by
process
of
reasoning
xvii
in
constructing
the
plot
and
working
it
out
with
the
proper
diction
the
poet
should
place
the
scene
as
far
as
possible
before
his
eyes
in
this
way
seeing
everything
with
the
utmost
vividness
as
if
he
were
a
spectator
of
the
action
he
will
discover
what
is
in
keeping
with
it
and
be
most
unlikely
to
overlook
inconsistencies
the
need
of
such
a
rule
is
shown
by
the
fault
found
in
carcinus
amphiaraus
was
on
his
way
from
the
temple
this
fact
escaped
the
observation
of
one
who
did
not
see
the
situation
on
the
stage
however
the
piece
failed
the
audience
being
offended
at
the
oversight
again
the
poet
should
work
out
his
play
to
the
best
of
his
power
with
appropriate
gestures
for
those
who
feel
emotion
are
most
convincing
through
natural
sympathy
with
the
characters
they
represent
and
one
who
is
agitated
storms
one
who
is
angry
rages
with
the
most
reality
hence
poetry
implies
either
a
happy
gift
of
nature
or
a
strain
of
madness
in
the
one
case
a
man
can
take
the
mould
of
any
character
in
the
other
he
is
lifted
out
of
his
proper
self
as
for
the
story
whether
the
poet
takes
it
ready
made
or
constructs
it
for
himself
he
should
first
sketch
its
general
outline
and
then
fill
in
the
episodes
and
amplify
in
detail
the
general
plan
may
be
illustrated
by
the
iphigenia
a
young
girl
is
sacrificed
she
disappears
mysteriously
from
the
eyes
of
those
who
sacrificed
her
she
is
transported
to
another
country
where
the
custom
is
to
offer
up
all
strangers
to
the
goddess
to
this
ministry
she
is
appointed
some
time
later
her
own
brother
chances
to
arrive
the
fact
that
the
oracle
for
some
reason
ordered
him
to
go
there
is
outside
the
general
plan
of
the
play
the
purpose
again
of
his
coming
is
outside
the
action
proper
however
he
comes
he
is
seized
and
when
on
the
point
of
being
sacrificed
reveals
who
he
is
the
mode
of
recognition
may
be
either
that
of
euripides
or
of
polyidus
in
whose
play
he
exclaims
very
naturally
it
was
not
my
sister
only
but
i
too
who
was
doomed
to
be
sacrificed
and
by
that
remark
he
is
saved
after
this
the
names
being
once
given
it
remains
to
fill
in
the
episodes
we
must
see
that
they
are
relevant
to
the
action
in
the
case
of
orestes
for
example
there
is
the
madness
which
led
to
his
capture
and
his
deliverance
by
means
of
the
purificatory
rite
in
the
drama
the
episodes
are
short
but
it
is
these
that
give
extension
to
epic
poetry
thus
the
story
of
the
odyssey
can
be
stated
briefly
a
certain
man
is
absent
from
home
for
many
years
he
is
jealously
watched
by
poseidon
and
left
desolate
meanwhile
his
home
is
in
a
wretched
plight
suitors
are
wasting
his
substance
and
plotting
against
his
son
at
length
he
himself
arrives
he
makes
certain
persons
acquainted
with
him
he
attacks
the
suitors
with
his
own
hand
and
is
himself
preserved
while
he
destroys
them
this
is
the
essence
of
the
plot
the
rest
is
episode
xviii
every
tragedy
falls
into
two
parts
complication
and
unravelling
or
denouement
incidents
extraneous
to
the
action
are
frequently
combined
with
a
portion
of
the
action
proper
to
form
the
complication
the
rest
is
the
unravelling
by
the
complication
i
mean
all
that
extends
from
the
beginning
of
the
action
to
the
part
which
marks
the
to
good
or
bad
fortune
the
unravelling
is
that
which
extends
from
the
beginning
of
the
change
to
the
end
thus
in
the
lynceus
of
theodectes
the
complication
consists
of
the
incidents
presupposed
in
the
drama
the
seizure
of
the
child
and
then
again
the
unravelling
extends
from
the
accusation
of
murder
to
the
end
there
are
four
kinds
of
tragedy
the
complex
depending
entirely
on
reversal
of
the
situation
and
recognition
the
pathetic
where
the
motive
is
passion
such
as
the
tragedies
on
ajax
and
ixion
the
ethical
where
the
motives
are
ethical
such
as
the
phthiotides
and
the
peleus
the
fourth
kind
is
the
simple
we
here
exclude
the
purely
spectacular
element
exemplified
by
the
phorcides
the
prometheus
and
scenes
laid
in
hades
the
poet
should
endeavour
if
possible
to
combine
all
poetic
elements
or
failing
that
the
greatest
number
and
those
the
most
important
the
more
so
in
face
of
the
cavilling
criticism
of
the
day
for
whereas
there
have
hitherto
been
good
poets
each
in
his
own
branch
the
critics
now
expect
one
man
to
surpass
all
others
in
their
several
lines
of
excellence
in
speaking
of
a
tragedy
as
the
same
or
different
the
best
test
to
take
is
the
plot
identity
exists
where
the
complication
and
unravelling
are
the
same
many
poets
tie
the
knot
well
but
unravel
it
ill
both
arts
however
should
always
be
mastered
again
the
poet
should
remember
what
has
been
often
said
and
not
make
an
epic
structure
into
a
tragedy
by
an
epic
structure
i
mean
one
with
a
multiplicity
of
plots
as
if
for
instance
you
were
to
make
a
tragedy
out
of
the
entire
story
of
the
iliad
in
the
epic
poem
owing
to
its
length
each
part
assumes
its
proper
magnitude
in
the
drama
the
result
is
far
from
answering
to
the
poet
expectation
the
proof
is
that
the
poets
who
have
dramatised
the
whole
story
of
the
fall
of
troy
instead
of
selecting
portions
like
euripides
or
who
have
taken
the
whole
tale
of
niobe
and
not
a
part
of
her
story
like
aeschylus
either
fail
utterly
or
meet
with
poor
success
on
the
stage
even
agathon
has
been
known
to
fail
from
this
one
defect
in
his
reversals
of
the
situation
however
he
shows
a
marvellous
skill
in
the
effort
to
hit
the
popular
taste
to
produce
a
tragic
effect
that
satisfies
the
moral
sense
this
effect
is
produced
when
the
clever
rogue
like
sisyphus
is
outwitted
or
the
brave
villain
defeated
such
an
event
is
probable
in
sense
of
the
word
is
probable
he
says
many
things
should
happen
contrary
to
probability
the
chorus
too
should
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
actors
it
should
be
an
integral
part
of
the
whole
and
share
in
the
action
in
the
manner
not
of
euripides
but
of
sophocles
as
for
the
later
poets
their
choral
songs
pertain
as
little
to
the
subject
of
the
piece
as
to
that
of
any
other
tragedy
they
are
therefore
sung
as
mere
interludes
a
practice
first
begun
by
agathon
yet
what
difference
is
there
between
introducing
such
choral
interludes
and
transferring
a
speech
or
even
a
whole
act
from
one
play
to
another
xix
it
remains
to
speak
of
diction
and
thought
the
other
parts
of
tragedy
having
been
already
discussed
concerning
thought
we
may
assume
what
is
said
in
the
rhetoric
to
which
inquiry
the
subject
more
strictly
belongs
under
thought
is
included
every
effect
which
has
to
be
produced
by
speech
the
subdivisions
being
proof
and
refutation
the
excitation
of
the
feelings
such
as
pity
fear
anger
and
the
like
the
suggestion
of
importance
or
its
opposite
now
it
is
evident
that
the
dramatic
incidents
must
be
treated
from
the
same
points
of
view
as
the
dramatic
speeches
when
the
object
is
to
evoke
the
sense
of
pity
fear
importance
or
probability
the
only
difference
is
that
the
incidents
should
speak
for
themselves
without
verbal
exposition
while
the
effects
aimed
at
in
speech
should
be
produced
by
the
speaker
and
as
a
result
of
the
speech
for
what
were
the
business
of
a
speaker
if
the
thought
were
revealed
quite
apart
from
what
he
says
next
as
regards
diction
one
branch
of
the
inquiry
treats
of
the
modes
of
utterance
but
this
province
of
knowledge
belongs
to
the
art
of
delivery
and
to
the
masters
of
that
science
it
includes
for
instance
what
is
a
command
a
prayer
a
statement
a
threat
a
question
an
answer
and
so
forth
to
know
or
not
to
know
these
things
involves
no
serious
censure
upon
the
poet
art
for
who
can
admit
the
fault
imputed
to
homer
by
protagoras
that
in
the
words
goddess
of
the
wrath
he
gives
a
command
under
the
idea
that
he
utters
a
prayer
for
to
tell
some
one
to
do
a
thing
or
not
to
do
it
is
he
says
a
command
we
may
therefore
pass
this
over
as
an
inquiry
that
belongs
to
another
art
not
to
poetry
xx
language
in
general
includes
the
following
parts
letter

noun
verb
inflexion
or

sentence
or

a

is
an
indivisible
sound
yet
not
every
such
sound
but
only
one
which
can
form
part
of
a
group
of
sounds
for
even
brutes
utter
indivisible
sounds
none
of
which
i
call
a
letter
the
sound
i
mean
may
be
either
a
vowel
a
or
a
mute
a
vowel
is
that
which
without
impact
of
tongue
or
lip
has
an
audible
sound
a
that
which
with
such
impact
has
an
audible
sound
as
s
and
a
mute
that
which
with
such
impact
has
by
itself
no
sound
but
joined
to
a
vowel
sound
becomes
audible
as
g
and
these
are
distinguished
according
to
the
form
assumed
by
the
mouth
and
the
place
where
they
are
produced
according
as
they
are
aspirated
or
smooth

short
as
they
are
acute
grave
or
of
an
intermediate
tone
which
inquiry
belongs
in
detail
to
the
writers
on
metre
a
syllable
is
a
sound
composed
of
a
mute
and
a
vowel
for
gr
without
a
is
a
syllable
as
also
with
a
gra
but
the
investigation
of
these
differences
belongs
also
to
metrical
science
a
connecting
word
is
a
sound
which
neither
causes
nor
hinders
the
union
of
many
sounds
into
one
significant
sound
it
may
be
placed
at
either
end
or
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
or
a
sound
which
out
of
several
sounds
each
of
them
significant
is
capable
of
forming
one
significant
sound
as
alpha
mu
theta
iota
pi
epsilon
rho
iota
and
the
like
or
a
sound
which
marks
the
beginning
end
or
division
of
a
sentence
such
however
that
it
can
not
correctly
stand
by
itself
at
the
beginning
of
a
sentence
as
mu
epsilon
nu
eta
tau
omicron
iota
delta
epsilon
a
noun
is
a
composite
significant
sound
not
marking
time
of
which
no
part
is
in
itself
significant
for
in
double
or
compound
words
we
do
not
employ
the
separate
parts
as
if
each
were
in
itself
significant
thus
in
theodorus
the
delta
omega
rho
omicron
nu
or
is
not
in
itself
significant
a
verb
is
a
composite
significant
sound
marking
time
in
which
as
in
the
noun
no
part
is
in
itself
significant
for
or
does
not
express
the
idea
of

walks
or
has
walked
does
connote
time
present
or
past
inflexion
belongs
both
to
the
noun
and
verb
and
expresses
either
the
relation
or
the
like
or
that
of
number
whether
one
or
many
as
or
or
the
modes
or
tones
in
actual
delivery
a
question
or
a
command
he
go
and
are
verbal
inflexions
of
this
kind
a
sentence
or
phrase
is
a
composite
significant
sound
some
at
least
of
whose
parts
are
in
themselves
significant
for
not
every
such
group
of
words
consists
of
verbs
and
nouns
definition
of
man
for
example
but
it
may
dispense
even
with
the
verb
still
it
will
always
have
some
significant
part
as
walking
or
son
of
cleon
a
sentence
or
phrase
may
form
a
unity
in
two
ways
either
as
signifying
one
thing
or
as
consisting
of
several
parts
linked
together
thus
the
iliad
is
one
by
the
linking
together
of
parts
the
definition
of
man
by
the
unity
of
the
thing
signified

words
are
of
two
kinds
simple
and
double
by
simple
i
mean
those
composed
of
elements
such
as
gamma
eta
by
double
or
compound
those
composed
either
of
a
significant
and
element
though
within
the
whole
word
no
element
is
significant
or
of
elements
that
are
both
significant
a
word
may
likewise
be
triple
quadruple
or
multiple
in
form
like
so
many
massilian
expressions
who
prayed
to
father
zeus
every
word
is
either
current
or
strange
or
metaphorical
or
ornamental
or
or
lengthened
or
contracted
or
altered
by
a
current
or
proper
word
i
mean
one
which
is
in
general
use
among
a
people
by
a
strange
word
one
which
is
in
use
in
another
country
plainly
therefore
the
same
word
may
be
at
once
strange
and
current
but
not
in
relation
to
the
same
people
the
word
sigma
iota
gamma
upsilon
nu
omicron
nu
is
to
the
cyprians
a
current
term
but
to
us
a
strange
one
metaphor
is
the
application
of
an
alien
name
by
transference
either
from
genus
to
species
or
from
species
to
genus
or
from
species
to
species
or
by
analogy
that
is
proportion
thus
from
genus
to
species
as
lies
my
ship
for
lying
at
anchor
is
a
species
of
lying
from
species
to
genus
as
ten
thousand
noble
deeds
hath
odysseus
wrought
for
ten
thousand
is
a
species
of
large
number
and
is
here
used
for
a
large
number
generally
from
species
to
species
as
blade
of
bronze
drew
away
the
life
and
the
water
with
the
vessel
of
unyielding
bronze
here
alpha

is
used
for
tau
alpha
mu
epsilon

nu
cleave
and
tau
alpha
mu
epsilon
iota
nu
again
for
alpha
rho
upsilon
alpha
iota
each
being
a
species
of
taking
away
analogy
or
proportion
is
when
the
second
term
is
to
the
first
as
the
fourth
to
the
third
we
may
then
use
the
fourth
for
the
second
or
the
second
for
the
fourth
sometimes
too
we
qualify
the
metaphor
by
adding
the
term
to
which
the
proper
word
is
relative
thus
the
cup
is
to
dionysus
as
the
shield
to
ares
the
cup
may
therefore
be
called
shield
of
dionysus
and
the
shield
cup
of
ares
or
again
as
old
age
is
to
life
so
is
evening
to
day
evening
may
therefore
be
called
old
age
of
the
day
and
old
age
evening
of
life
or
in
the
phrase
of
empedocles
setting
sun
for
some
of
the
terms
of
the
proportion
there
is
at
times
no
word
in
existence
still
the
metaphor
may
be
used
for
instance
to
scatter
seed
is
called
sowing
but
the
action
of
the
sun
in
scattering
his
rays
is
nameless
still
this
process
bears
to
the
sun
the
same
relation
as
sowing
to
the
seed
hence
the
expression
of
the
poet
the
light
there
is
another
way
in
which
this
kind
of
metaphor
may
be
employed
we
may
apply
an
alien
term
and
then
deny
of
that
term
one
of
its
proper
attributes
as
if
we
were
to
call
the
shield
not
cup
of
ares
but
wineless
cup
an
ornamental
word
a
word
is
one
which
has
never
been
even
in
local
use
but
is
adopted
by
the
poet
himself
some
such
words
there
appear
to
be
as
epsilon
rho
nu
upsilon
gamma
epsilon
sigma
for

the
perfection
of
style
is
to
be
clear
without
being
mean
the
clearest
style
is
that
which
uses
only
current
or
proper
words
at
the
same
time
it
is
mean
witness
the
poetry
of
cleophon
and
of
sthenelus
that
diction
on
the
other
hand
is
lofty
and
raised
above
the
commonplace
which
employs
unusual
words
by
unusual
i
mean
strange
or
rare
words
metaphorical
lengthened
anything
in
short
that
differs
from
the
normal
idiom
yet
a
style
wholly
composed
of
such
words
is
either
a
riddle
or
a
jargon
a
riddle
if
it
consists
of
metaphors
a
jargon
if
it
consists
of
strange
or
rare
words
for
the
essence
of
a
riddle
is
to
express
true
facts
under
impossible
combinations
now
this
can
not
be
done
by
any
arrangement
of
ordinary
words
but
by
the
use
of
metaphor
it
can
such
is
the
riddle
man
i
saw
who
on
another
man
had
glued
the
bronze
by
aid
of
fire
and
others
of
the
same
kind
a
diction
that
is
made
up
of
strange
or
rare
terms
is
a
jargon
a
certain
infusion
therefore
of
these
elements
is
necessary
to
style
for
the
strange
or
rare
word
the
metaphorical
the
ornamental
and
the
other
kinds
above
mentioned
will
raise
it
above
the
commonplace
and
mean
while
the
use
of
proper
words
will
make
it
perspicuous
but
nothing
contributes
more
to
produce
a
clearness
of
diction
that
is
remote
from
commonness
than
the
lengthening
contraction
and
alteration
of
words
for
by
deviating
in
exceptional
cases
from
the
normal
idiom
the
language
will
gain
distinction
while
at
the
same
time
the
partial
conformity
with
usage
will
give
perspicuity
the
critics
therefore
are
in
error
who
censure
these
licenses
of
speech
and
hold
the
author
up
to
ridicule
thus
eucleides
the
elder
declared
that
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
be
a
poet
if
you
might
lengthen
syllables
at
will
he
caricatured
the
practice
in
the
very
form
of
his
diction
as
in
the
verse
epsilon
pi
iota
chi
alpha
rho
eta

to
employ
such
license
at
all
obtrusively
is
no
doubt
grotesque
but
in
any
mode
of
poetic
diction
there
must
be
moderation
even
metaphors
strange
or
rare
words
or
any
similar
forms
of
speech
would
produce
the
like
effect
if
used
without
propriety
and
with
the
express
purpose
of
being
ludicrous
how
great
a
difference
is
made
by
the
appropriate
use
of
lengthening
may
be
seen
in
epic
poetry
by
the
insertion
of
ordinary
forms
in
the
verse
so
again
if
we
take
a
strange
or
rare
word
a
metaphor
or
any
similar
mode
of
expression
and
replace
it
by
the
current
or
proper
term
the
truth
of
our
observation
will
be
manifest
for
example
aeschylus
and
euripides
each
composed
the
same
iambic
line
but
the
alteration
of
a
single
word
by
euripides
who
employed
the
rarer
term
instead
of
the
ordinary
one
makes
one
verse
appear
beautiful
and
the
other
trivial
aeschylus
in
his

says

again
ariphrades
ridiculed
the
tragedians
for

which
no

would
employ
in

and
the
like
it
is
precisely
because
such
phrases
are
not
part
of
the
current
idiom
that
they
give
distinction
to
the
style
this
however
he
failed
to
see
it
is
a
great
matter
to
observe
propriety
in
these
several
modes
of
expression
as
also
in
compound
words
strange
or
rare
words
and
so
forth
but
the
greatest
thing
by
far
is
to
have
a
command
of
metaphor
this
alone
can
not
be
imparted
by
another
it
is
the
mark
of
genius
for
to
make
good
metaphors
implies
an
eye
for
resemblances
of
the
various
kinds
of
words
the
compound
are
best
adapted
to
dithyrambs
rare
words
to
heroic
poetry
metaphors
to
iambic
in
heroic
poetry
indeed
all
these
varieties
are
serviceable
but
in
iambic
verse
which
reproduces
as
far
as
may
be
familiar
speech
the
most
appropriate
words
are
those
which
are
found
even
in
prose
these
are
the
current
or
proper
the
metaphorical
the
ornamental
concerning
tragedy
and
imitation
by
means
of
action
this
may
suffice
xxiii
as
to
that
poetic
imitation
which
is
narrative
in
form
and
employs
a
single
metre
the
plot
manifestly
ought
as
in
a
tragedy
to
be
constructed
on
dramatic
principles
it
should
have
for
its
subject
a
single
action
whole
and
complete
with
a
beginning
a
middle
and
an
end
it
will
thus
resemble
a
living
organism
in
all
its
unity
and
produce
the
pleasure
proper
to
it
it
will
differ
in
structure
from
historical
compositions
which
of
necessity
present
not
a
single
action
but
a
single
period
and
all
that
happened
within
that
period
to
one
person
or
to
many
little
connected
together
as
the
events
may
be
for
as
the
at
salamis
and
the
battle
with
the
carthaginians
in
sicily
took
place
at
the
same
time
but
did
not
tend
to
any
one
result
so
in
the
sequence
of
events
one
thing
sometimes
follows
another
and
yet
no
single
result
is
thereby
produced
such
is
the
practice
we
may
say
of
most
poets
here
again
then
as
has
been
already
observed
the
transcendent
excellence
of
homer
is
manifest
he
never
attempts
to
make
the
whole
war
of
troy
the
subject
of
his
poem
though
that
war
had
a
beginning
and
an
end
it
would
have
been
too
vast
a
theme
and
not
easily
embraced
in
a
single
view
if
again
he
had
kept
it
within
moderate
limits
it
must
have
been
by
the
variety
of
the
incidents
as
it
is
he
detaches
a
single
portion
and
admits
as
episodes
many
events
from
the
general
story
of
the
war
such
as
the
catalogue
of
the
ships
and
others
thus
diversifying
the
poem
all
other
poets
take
a
single
hero
a
single
period
or
an
action
single
indeed
but
with
a
multiplicity
of
parts
thus
did
the
author
of
the
cypria
and
of
the
little
iliad
for
this
reason
the
iliad
and
the
odyssey
each
furnish
the
subject
of
one
tragedy
or
at
most
of
two
while
the
cypria
supplies
materials
for
many
and
the
little
iliad
for
eight
the
award
of
the
arms
the
philoctetes
the
neoptolemus
the
eurypylus
the
mendicant
odysseus
the
laconian
women
the
fall
of
ilium
the
departure
of
the
fleet
xxiv
again
epic
poetry
must
have
as
many
kinds
as
tragedy
it
must
be
simple
or
complex
or
or
the
parts
also
with
the
exception
of
song
and
spectacle
are
the
same
for
it
requires
reversals
of
the
situation
recognitions
and
scenes
of
suffering
moreover
the
thoughts
and
the
diction
must
be
artistic
in
all
these
respects
homer
is
our
earliest
and
sufficient
model
indeed
each
of
his
poems
has
a
twofold
character
the
iliad
is
at
once
simple
and
and
the
odyssey
complex
for
recognition
scenes
run
through
it
and
at
the
same
time
moreover
in
diction
and
thought
they
are
supreme
epic
poetry
differs
from
tragedy
in
the
scale
on
which
it
is
constructed
and
in
its
metre
as
regards
scale
or
length
we
have
already
laid
down
an
adequate
limit
the
beginning
and
the
end
must
be
capable
of
being
brought
within
a
single
view
this
condition
will
be
satisfied
by
poems
on
a
smaller
scale
than
the
old
epics
and
answering
in
length
to
the
group
of
tragedies
presented
at
a
single
sitting
epic
poetry
has
however
a
great
a
special
capacity
for
enlarging
its
dimensions
and
we
can
see
the
reason
in
tragedy
we
can
not
imitate
several
lines
of
actions
carried
on
at
one
and
the
same
time
we
must
confine
ourselves
to
the
action
on
the
stage
and
the
part
taken
by
the
players
but
in
epic
poetry
owing
to
the
narrative
form
many
events
simultaneously
transacted
can
be
presented
and
these
if
relevant
to
the
subject
add
mass
and
dignity
to
the
poem
the
epic
has
here
an
advantage
and
one
that
conduces
to
grandeur
of
effect
to
diverting
the
mind
of
the
hearer
and
relieving
the
story
with
varying
episodes
for
sameness
of
incident
soon
produces
satiety
and
makes
tragedies
fail
on
the
stage
as
for
the
metre
the
heroic
measure
has
proved
its
fitness
by
the
test
of
experience
if
a
narrative
poem
in
any
other
metre
or
in
many
metres
were
now
composed
it
would
be
found
incongruous
for
of
all
measures
the
heroic
is
the
stateliest
and
the
most
massive
and
hence
it
most
readily
admits
rare
words
and
metaphors
which
is
another
point
in
which
the
narrative
form
of
imitation
stands
alone
on
the
other
hand
the
iambic
and
the
trochaic
tetrameter
are
stirring
measures
the
latter
being
akin
to
dancing
the
former
expressive
of
action
still
more
absurd
would
it
be
to
mix
together
different
metres
as
was
done
by
chaeremon
hence
no
one
has
ever
composed
a
poem
on
a
great
scale
in
any
other
than
heroic
verse
nature
herself
as
we
have
said
teaches
the
choice
of
the
proper
measure
homer
admirable
in
all
respects
has
the
special
merit
of
being
the
only
poet
who
rightly
appreciates
the
part
he
should
take
himself
the
poet
should
speak
as
little
as
possible
in
his
own
person
for
it
is
not
this
that
makes
him
an
imitator
other
poets
appear
themselves
upon
the
scene
throughout
and
imitate
but
little
and
rarely
homer
after
a
few
prefatory
words
at
once
brings
in
a
man
or
woman
or
other
personage
none
of
them
wanting
in
characteristic
qualities
but
each
with
a
character
of
his
own
the
element
of
the
wonderful
is
required
in
tragedy
the
irrational
on
which
the
wonderful
depends
for
its
chief
effects
has
wider
scope
in
epic
poetry
because
there
the
person
acting
is
not
seen
thus
the
pursuit
of
hector
would
be
ludicrous
if
placed
upon
the
stage
the
greeks
standing
still
and
not
joining
in
the
pursuit
and
achilles
waving
them
back
but
in
the
epic
poem
the
absurdity
passes
unnoticed
now
the
wonderful
is
pleasing
as
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
every
one
tells
a
story
with
some
addition
of
his
own
knowing
that
his
hearers
like
it
it
is
homer
who
has
chiefly
taught
other
poets
the
art
of
telling
lies
skilfully
the
secret
of
it
lies
in
a
fallacy
for
assuming
that
if
one
thing
is
or
becomes
a
second
is
or
becomes
men
imagine
that
if
the
second
is
the
first
likewise
is
or
becomes
but
this
is
a
false
inference
hence
where
the
first
thing
is
untrue
it
is
quite
unnecessary
provided
the
second
be
true
to
add
that
the
first
is
or
has
become
for
the
mind
knowing
the
second
to
be
true
falsely
infers
the
truth
of
the
first
there
is
an
example
of
this
in
the
bath
scene
of
the
odyssey
accordingly
the
poet
should
prefer
probable
impossibilities
to
improbable
possibilities
the
tragic
plot
must
not
be
composed
of
irrational
parts
everything
irrational
should
if
possible
be
excluded
or
at
all
events
it
should
lie
outside
the
action
of
the
play
as
in
the
oedipus
the
hero
ignorance
as
to
the
manner
of
laius
death
not
within
the
drama
as
in
the
electra
the
account
of
the
pythian
games
or
as
in
the
mysians
the
man
who
has
come
from
tegea
to
mysia
and
is
still
speechless
the
plea
that
otherwise
the
plot
would
have
been
ruined
is
ridiculous
such
a
plot
should
not
in
the
first
instance
be
constructed
but
once
the
irrational
has
been
introduced
and
an
air
of
likelihood
imparted
to
it
we
must
accept
it
in
spite
of
the
absurdity
take
even
the
irrational
incidents
in
the
odyssey
where
odysseus
is
left
upon
the
shore
of
ithaca
how
intolerable
even
these
might
have
been
would
be
apparent
if
an
inferior
poet
were
to
treat
the
subject
as
it
is
the
absurdity
is
veiled
by
the
poetic
charm
with
which
the
poet
invests
it
the
diction
should
be
elaborated
in
the
pauses
of
the
action
where
there
is
no
expression
of
character
or
thought
for
conversely
character
and
thought
are
merely
obscured
by
a
diction
that
is
over
brilliant
xxv
with
respect
to
critical
difficulties
and
their
solutions
the
number
and
nature
of
the
sources
from
which
they
may
be
drawn
may
be
thus
exhibited
the
poet
being
an
imitator
like
a
painter
or
any
other
artist
must
of
necessity
imitate
one
of
three
objects
things
as
they
were
or
are
things
as
they
are
said
or
thought
to
be
or
things
as
they
ought
to
be
the
vehicle
of
expression
is
language
either
current
terms
or
it
may
be
rare
words
or
metaphors
there
are
also
many
modifications
of
language
which
we
concede
to
the
poets
add
to
this
that
the
standard
of
correctness
is
not
the
same
in
poetry
and
politics
any
more
than
in
poetry
and
any
other
art
within
the
art
of
poetry
itself
there
are
two
kinds
of
faults
those
which
touch
its
essence
and
those
which
are
accidental
if
a
poet
has
chosen
to
imitate
something
but
has
imitated
it
incorrectly
through
want
of
capacity
the
error
is
inherent
in
the
poetry
but
if
the
failure
is
due
to
a
wrong
choice
if
he
has
represented
a
horse
as
throwing
out
both
his
off
legs
at
once
or
introduced
technical
inaccuracies
in
medicine
for
example
or
in
any
other
art
the
error
is
not
essential
to
the
poetry
these
are
the
points
of
view
from
which
we
should
consider
and
answer
the
objections
raised
by
the
critics
first
as
to
matters
which
concern
the
poet
own
art
if
he
describes
the
impossible
he
is
guilty
of
an
error
but
the
error
may
be
justified
if
the
end
of
the
art
be
thereby
attained
the
end
being
that
already
mentioned
if
that
is
the
effect
of
this
or
any
other
part
of
the
poem
is
thus
rendered
more
striking
a
case
in
point
is
the
pursuit
of
hector
if
however
the
end
might
have
been
as
well
or
better
attained
without
violating
the
special
rules
of
the
poetic
art
the
error
is
not
justified
for
every
kind
of
error
should
if
possible
be
avoided
again
does
the
error
touch
the
essentials
of
the
poetic
art
or
some
accident
of
it
for
example
not
to
know
that
a
hind
has
no
horns
is
a
less
serious
matter
than
to
paint
it
inartistically
further
if
it
be
objected
that
the
description
is
not
true
to
fact
the
poet
may
perhaps
reply
the
objects
are
as
they
ought
to
be
just
as
sophocles
said
that
he
drew
men
as
they
ought
to
be
euripides
as
they
are
in
this
way
the
objection
may
be
met
if
however
the
representation
be
of
neither
kind
the
poet
may
answer
this
is
how
men
say
the
thing
is
this
applies
to
tales
about
the
gods
it
may
well
be
that
these
stories
are
not
higher
than
fact
nor
yet
true
to
fact
they
are
very
possibly
what
xenophanes
says
of
them
but
anyhow
is
what
is
said
again
a
description
may
be
no
better
than
the
fact
it
was
the
fact
as
in
the
passage
about
the
arms
upon
their
stood
the
spears
this
was
the
custom
then
as
it
now
is
among
the
illyrians
again
in
examining
whether
what
has
been
said
or
done
by
some
one
is
poetically
right
or
not
we
must
not
look
merely
to
the
particular
act
or
saying
and
ask
whether
it
is
poetically
good
or
bad
we
must
also
consider
by
whom
it
is
said
or
done
to
whom
when
by
what
means
or
for
what
end
whether
for
instance
it
be
to
secure
a
greater
good
or
avert
a
greater
evil
other
difficulties
may
be
resolved
by
due
regard
to
the
usage
of
language
we
may
note
a
rare
word
as
in
omicron
upsilon
rho
eta
alpha
sigma
mu
epsilon
nu
pi
rho
omega
tau
omicron
nu
where
the
poet
perhaps
employs
omicron
upsilon
rho
eta
alpha
sigma
not
in
the
sense
of
mules
but
of
sentinels
so
again
of
dolon
indeed
he
was
to
look
upon
it
is
not
meant
that
his
body
was
but
that
his
face
was
ugly
for
the
cretans
use
the
word
epsilon
upsilon
epsilon
iota
delta
epsilon
sigma
to
denote
a
fair
face
again
zeta
omega
rho
omicron
tau
epsilon
rho

kappa

iota
epsilon
the
drink
livelier
does
not
mean
it
stronger
as
for
hard
drinkers
but
it
quicker
sometimes
an
expression
is
metaphorical
as
all
gods
and
men
were
sleeping
through
the
night
while
at
the
same
time
the
poet
says
indeed
as
he
turned
his
gaze
to
the
trojan
plain
he
marvelled
at
the
sound
of
flutes
and
pipes
is
here
used
metaphorically
for
all
being
a
species
of
many
so
in
the
verse
she
hath
no
part
omicron
iota
eta
is
metaphorical
for
the
best
known
may
be
called
the
only
one
again
the
solution
may
depend
upon
accent
or
breathing
thus
hippias
of
thasos
solved
the
difficulties
in
the
lines
delta

or
again
the
question
may
be
solved
by
punctuation
as
in
empedocles
a
sudden
things
became
mortal
that
before
had
learnt
to
be
immortal
and
things
unmixed
before
mixed
or
again
by
ambiguity
of
meaning
as
pi
alpha
rho
omega
chi
eta
kappa
epsilon
nu
delta
epsilon
pi
lambda
epsilon
omega
nu
upsilon
xi
where
the
word
pi
lambda
epsilon
omega
is
ambiguous
or
by
the
usage
of
language
thus
any
mixed
drink
is
called
omicron
iota
nu
omicron
sigma
hence
ganymede
is
said
pour
the
wine
to
zeus
though
the
gods
do
not
drink
wine
so
too
workers
in
iron
are
called
chi
alpha
lambda
kappa
epsilon
alpha
sigma
or
workers
in
bronze
this
however
may
also
be
taken
as
a
metaphor
again
when
a
word
seems
to
involve
some
inconsistency
of
meaning
we
should
consider
how
many
senses
it
may
bear
in
the
particular
passage
for
example
was
stayed
the
spear
of
bronze
we
should
ask
in
how
many
ways
we
may
take
checked
there
the
true
mode
of
interpretation
is
the
precise
opposite
of
what
glaucon
mentions
critics
he
says
jump
at
certain
groundless
conclusions
they
pass
adverse
judgment
and
then
proceed
to
reason
on
it
and
assuming
that
the
poet
has
said
whatever
they
happen
to
think
find
fault
if
a
thing
is
inconsistent
with
their
own
fancy
the
question
about
icarius
has
been
treated
in
this
fashion
the
critics
imagine
he
was
a
lacedaemonian
they
think
it
strange
therefore
that
telemachus
should
not
have
met
him
when
he
went
to
lacedaemon
but
the
cephallenian
story
may
perhaps
be
the
true
one
they
allege
that
odysseus
took
a
wife
from
among
themselves
and
that
her
father
was
icadius
not
icarius
it
is
merely
a
mistake
then
that
gives
plausibility
to
the
objection
in
general
the
impossible
must
be
justified
by
reference
to
artistic
requirements
or
to
the
higher
reality
or
to
received
opinion
with
respect
to
the
requirements
of
art
a
probable
impossibility
is
to
be
preferred
to
a
thing
improbable
and
yet
possible
again
it
may
be
impossible
that
there
should
be
men
such
as
zeuxis
painted
we
say
the
impossible
is
the
higher
thing
for
the
ideal
type
must
surpass
the
reality
to
justify
the
irrational
we
appeal
to
what
is
commonly
said
to
be
in
addition
to
which
we
urge
that
the
irrational
sometimes
does
not
violate
reason
just
as
is
probable
that
a
thing
may
happen
contrary
to
probability
things
that
sound
contradictory
should
be
examined
by
the
same
rules
as
in
dialectical
refutation
whether
the
same
thing
is
meant
in
the
same
relation
and
in
the
same
sense
we
should
therefore
solve
the
question
by
reference
to
what
the
poet
says
himself
or
to
what
is
tacitly
assumed
by
a
person
of
intelligence
the
element
of
the
irrational
and
similarly
depravity
of
character
are
justly
censured
when
there
is
no
inner
necessity
for
introducing
them
such
is
the
irrational
element
in
the
introduction
of
aegeus
by
euripides
and
the
badness
of
menelaus
in
the
orestes
thus
there
are
five
sources
from
which
critical
objections
are
drawn
things
are
censured
either
as
impossible
or
irrational
or
morally
hurtful
or
contradictory
or
contrary
to
artistic
correctness
the
answers
should
be
sought
under
the
twelve
heads
above
mentioned
xxvi
the
question
may
be
raised
whether
the
epic
or
tragic
mode
of
imitation
is
the
higher
if
the
more
refined
art
is
the
higher
and
the
more
refined
in
every
case
is
that
which
appeals
to
the
better
sort
of
audience
the
art
which
imitates
anything
and
everything
is
manifestly
most
unrefined
the
audience
is
supposed
to
be
too
dull
to
comprehend
unless
something
of
their
own
is
thrown
in
by
the
performers
who
therefore
indulge
in
restless
movements
bad
twist
and
twirl
if
they
have
to
represent
or
hustle
the
coryphaeus
when
they
perform
the
tragedy
it
is
said
has
this
same
defect
we
may
compare
the
opinion
that
the
older
actors
entertained
of
their
successors
mynniscus
used
to
call
callippides
on
account
of
the
extravagance
of
his
action
and
the
same
view
was
held
of
pindarus
tragic
art
then
as
a
whole
stands
to
epic
in
the
same
relation
as
the
younger
to
the
elder
actors
so
we
are
told
that
epic
poetry
is
addressed
to
a
cultivated
audience
who
do
not
need
gesture
tragedy
to
an
inferior
public
being
then
unrefined
it
is
evidently
the
lower
of
the
two
now
in
the
first
place
this
censure
attaches
not
to
the
poetic
but
to
the
histrionic
art
for
gesticulation
may
be
equally
overdone
in
epic
recitation
as
by
or
in
lyrical
competition
as
by
mnasitheus
the
opuntian
next
all
action
is
not
to
be
condemned
any
more
than
all
dancing
but
only
that
of
bad
performers
such
was
the
fault
found
in
callippides
as
also
in
others
of
our
own
day
who
are
censured
for
representing
degraded
women
again
tragedy
like
epic
poetry
produces
its
effect
even
without
action
it
reveals
its
power
by
mere
reading
if
then
in
all
other
respects
it
is
superior
this
fault
we
say
is
not
inherent
in
it
and
superior
it
is
because
it
has
all
the
epic
elements
it
may
even
use
the
epic
metre
with
the
music
and
spectacular
effects
as
important
accessories
and
these
produce
the
most
vivid
of
pleasures
further
it
has
vividness
of
impression
in
reading
as
well
as
in
representation
moreover
the
art
attains
its
end
within
narrower
limits
for
the
concentrated
effect
is
more
pleasurable
than
one
which
is
spread
over
a
long
time
and
so
diluted
what
for
example
would
be
the
effect
of
the
oedipus
of
sophocles
if
it
were
cast
into
a
form
as
long
as
the
iliad
once
more
the
epic
imitation
has
less
unity
as
is
shown
by
this
that
any
epic
poem
will
furnish
subjects
for
several
tragedies
thus
if
the
story
adopted
by
the
poet
has
a
strict
unity
it
must
either
be
concisely
told
and
appear
truncated
or
if
it
conform
to
the
epic
canon
of
length
it
must
seem
weak
and
watery
such
length
implies
some
loss
of
unity
if
i
mean
the
poem
is
constructed
out
of
several
actions
like
the
iliad
and
the
odyssey
which
have
many
such
parts
each
with
a
certain
magnitude
of
its
own
yet
these
poems
are
as
perfect
as
possible
in
structure
each
is
in
the
highest
degree
attainable
an
imitation
of
a
single
action
if
then
tragedy
is
superior
to
epic
poetry
in
all
these
respects
and
moreover
fulfils
its
specific
function
better
as
an
art
for
each
art
ought
to
produce
not
any
chance
pleasure
but
the
pleasure
proper
to
it
as
already
stated
it
plainly
follows
that
tragedy
is
the
higher
art
as
attaining
its
end
more
perfectly
thus
much
may
suffice
concerning
tragic
and
epic
poetry
in
general
their
several
kinds
and
parts
with
the
number
of
each
and
their
differences
the
causes
that
make
a
poem
good
or
bad
the
objections
of
the
critics
and
the
answers
to
these
objections
