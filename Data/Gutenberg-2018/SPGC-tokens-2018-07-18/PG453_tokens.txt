i
broadway
to

the
door
marked
mcchesney
was
closed
buck
president
of
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
coming
gaily
down
the
hall
stopped
before
it
dismayed
as
one
who
with
a
spicy
bit
of
news
at
his
tongue
end
is
met
with
rebuff
before
the
first
syllable
is
voiced
that
closed
door
meant
busy
keep
out
she
be
reading
a
letter
buck
told
himself
grimly
then
he
turned
the
knob
and
entered
his
partner
office
emma
mcchesney
was
reading
a
letter
more
than
that
she
was
poring
over
it
so
that
at
the
interruption
she
glanced
up
in
a
maddeningly
manner
which
conveyed
the
impression
that
while
her
physical
eye
beheld
the
intruder
her
mental
eye
was
still
on
the
letter
i
knew
it
said
buck
morosely
emma
mcchesney
put
down
the
letter
and
smiled
sit
down
now
that
you
in
and
if
you
expect
me
to
say
what
you
doomed
to
disappointment
buck
remained
standing
both
gloved
hands
clasping
his
walking
stick
on
which
he
leaned
every
time
i
come
into
this
office
you
reading
the
latest
scrawl
from
your
son
one
would
think
jock
letters
were
deathless
masterpieces
i
believe
you
read
them
at
intervals
all
week
and
on
sunday
get
all
out
and
play
solitaire
with
them
emma
mcchesney
smile
widened
frankly
to
a
grin
you
make
me
feel
like
a
who
been
caught
flirting
with
the
elevator
starter
have
i
been
neglecting
business
business
no
you
been
neglecting
me
now
you
just
come
from
the
tailor
and
i
suppose
it
did
fit
in
the
back
it
is
that
interrupted
buck
and
you
know
it
look
here
that
day
jock
went
away
and
we
came
back
to
the
office
and
you
said
i
know
i
said
it
but
do
remind
me
of
it
that
was
a
fair
test
i
had
just
seen
jock
leave
me
to
take
his
own
place
in
the
world
you
know
that
my
day
began
and
ended
with
him
he
was
my
reason
for
everything
when
i
saw
him
off
for
chicago
that
day
and
knew
he
was
going
there
to
stay
it
seemed
a
million
miles
from
new
york
i
was
blue
and
lonely
and
if
the
had
thrown
a
kind
word
to
me
i
have
broken
down
and
wept
on
his
shoulder
buck
still
standing
looked
down
between
narrowed
lids
at
his
business
partner
emma
mcchesney
he
said
steadily
do
you
mean
that
mcchesney
the
straightforward
looked
up
looked
down
fiddled
with
the
letter
in
her
hand
well
practically
yes
that
is
i
thought
now
that
you
going
to
the
mountains
for
a
month
it
might
give
me
a
chance
to
think
to
and
know
what
i
do
meanwhile
out
of
revenge
on
the
sex
i
just
ordered
three
suits
of
white
flannel
and
i
shall
break
every
feminine
heart
in
the
camp
regardless
oh
say
that
what
i
came
in
to
tell
you
guess
whom
i
saw
at
the
tailor
well
bones
whom
did
you
and
so
forth
fat
ed
meyers
i
just
glimpsed
him
in
one
of
the
and
they
were
draping
him
in
white
emma
mcchesney
sat
up
with
a
jerk
are
you
sure
sure
there
only
one
figure
like
that
he
had
the
thing
on
and
was
surveying
himself
in
the
mirror
or
as
much
of
himself
as
could
be
seen
in
one
ordinary
mirror
in
that
white
suit
with
his
red
face
above
it
he
looked
like
those
pictures
you
see
labeled
on
mountain
did
he
see
he
dodged
when
he
saw
me
actually
at
least
he
seems
to
have
the
decency
to
be
ashamed
of
the
deal
he
gave
us
when
he
left
us
flat
in
the
thick
of
his
middle
western
trip
and
went
back
to
the
skirt
company
i
wanted
him
to
know
i
had
seen
him
as
i
passed
i
said
mow
down
in
those
clothes
meyers
buck
sat
down
in
his
leisurely
fashion
and
laughed
his
low
pleasant
laugh
you
see
him
emma
at
the
seashore
but
something
in
emma
mcchesney
eyes
and
something
in
her
set
unsmiling
face
told
him
that
she
was
not
seeing
seashores
she
was
staring
straight
at
him
straight
through
him
miles
beyond
him
there
was
about
her
that
tense
electric
breathless
air
of
complete
detachment
which
always
enveloped
her
when
her
lightning
mind
was
leaping
ahead
to
a
goal
unguessed
by
the
slower
thinking
what
your
tailor
name
name
trotter
why
emma
mcchesney
had
the
telephone
operator
before
he
could
finish
get
me
trotter
the
tailor
say
i
want
to
speak
to
the
tailor
who
fits
ed
meyers
of
the
skirt
company
buck
leaned
forward
mouth
open
eyes
wide
well
what
in
the
name
of
i
let
you
know
in
a
minute
maybe
i
wrong
it
just
one
of
my
hunches
but
for
ten
years
i
sold
featherlooms
through
the
same
territory
that
ed
meyers
was
covering
for
the
skirt
people
it
did
take
me
ten
years
to
learn
that
fat
ed
had
the
decency
to
be
ashamed
of
any
deal
he
turned
no
matter
how
raw
and
let
me
tell
you
if
he
dodged
when
he
saw
you
it
was
because
he
was
ashamed
of
having
played
us
he
was
contemplating
playing
of
course
i
may
be
she
picked
up
the
receiver
in
answer
to
the
bell
then
sweetly
her
calm
eyes
smiling
into
buck
puzzled
ones
hello
is
this
meyers
tailor
i
to
ask
if
you
are
sure
that
the
grade
he
selected
is
the
proper
weight
for
the
tropics
what
oh
you
say
you
assured
him
it
was
the
weight
of
flannel
you
always
advise
for
south
america
and
you
said
they
be
ready
when
next
week
thank
you
she
hung
up
the
receiver
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
were
dilated
her
cheeks
were
very
pink
as
always
under
excitement
she
stood
up
her
breath
coming
rather
quickly
hurray
for
the
hunch
it
holds
fat
ed
meyers
is
going
down
to
south
america
for
the
company
it
what
i
been
planning
to
do
for
the
last
six
months
you
remember
i
spoke
of
it
you
the
idea
it
means
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
to
the
people
if
they
get
it
but
they
wo
get
it
buck
stood
up
suddenly
look
here
emma
if
you
i
certainly
am
nothing
can
stop
me
the
skirt
business
has
been
well
you
know
what
it
been
for
the
last
two
years
the
south
american
boats
sail
twice
a
month
fat
ed
meyers
clothes
are
promised
for
next
week
that
means
he
is
sailing
until
week
after
next
but
the
next
boat
sails
in
three
days
she
picked
up
a
piece
of
paper
from
her
desk
and
tossed
it
into
buck
hand
that
the
letter
i
was
reading
when
you
came
in
no
do
read
it
let
me
tell
you
instead
buck
threw
cane
hat
gloves
and
letter
on
the
broad
desk
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
prepared
for
argument
but
he
got
only
as
far
as
but
i
wo
allow
it
you
could
get
away
in
three
days
at
any
rate
and
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
you
have
come
to
your
senses
and
besides
i
do
mean
to
be
rude
but
here
are
your
hat
and
stick
and
gloves
it
going
to
take
me
just
hours
to
mobilize
but
emma
even
if
you
do
get
in
ahead
of
meyers
it
an
insane
idea
a
woman
ca
go
down
there
alone
it
is
safe
it
bad
enough
for
a
man
to
tackle
it
besides
we
holding
our
own
that
just
it
when
a
doctor
issues
a
bulletin
to
the
effect
that
the
patient
is
holding
his
own
you
may
have
noticed
that
the
relatives
always
begin
to
gather
it
a
bubble
this
south
american
idea
oshkosh
and
southport
and
altoona
money
has
always
been
good
enough
for
us
if
we
can
keep
that
trade
we
ought
to
be
thankful
emma
mcchesney
pushed
her
hair
back
from
her
forehead
with
one
gesture
and
patted
it
into
place
with
another
those
two
gestures
to
one
who
knew
her
meant
loss
of
composure
for
one
instant
followed
by
the
quick
regaining
of
it
the
next
let
not
argue
about
it
now
suppose
we
wait
until
when
it
too
late
i
am
thankful
for
the
trade
we
got
but
i
want
to
be
narrow
about
it
my
thanking
capacity
is
such
that
i
can
stretch
it
out
to
cover
some
things
we
have
got
yet
i
been
reading
up
on
south
america
reading
put
in
buck
hotly
what
actual
information
can
you
get
about
a
country
from
books
well
then
i
have
only
been
reading
i
been
talking
to
everyone
i
could
lay
my
hands
on
who
has
been
down
there
and
who
knows
those
south
american
women
love
dress
especially
the
argentines
and
do
you
know
what
they
been
wearing
petticoats
made
in
england
you
know
what
that
means
an
english
woman
chooses
a
petticoat
like
she
does
a
husband
for
life
it
is
only
a
garment
it
a
shelter
it
built
like
a
tent
if
once
i
can
introduce
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
and
knickerbocker
into
sunny
south
america
they
use
those
english
and
german
petticoats
for
linoleum
heaven
knows
they
fit
the
floor
better
than
the
human
form
but
buck
was
unsmiling
the
muscles
of
his
jaw
were
tense
i
wo
let
you
go
understand
that
i
wo
allow
it
tut
tut
what
is
this
stuff
emma
i
tell
you
it
dangerous
it
is
worth
the
risk
no
matter
what
it
brings
us
emma
mcchesney
struck
an
attitude
hand
on
heart
will
protect
the
working
girrul
she
sang
buck
grabbed
his
hat
i
going
to
wire
jock
all
right
that
save
me
fifty
cents
do
you
know
what
he
wire
back
to
it
get
the
tango
on
its
native
tairn
or
words
to
that
effect
emma
use
a
little
logic
and
common
sense
there
was
a
note
in
buck
voice
that
brought
a
quick
response
from
mcchesney
she
dropped
her
little
air
of
gayety
the
pain
in
his
voice
and
the
hurt
in
his
eyes
and
the
pleading
in
his
whole
attitude
banished
the
smile
from
her
face
it
had
not
been
much
of
a
smile
anyway
knew
her
genuine
smiles
well
enough
to
recognize
a
counterfeit
at
sight
and
emma
mcchesney
knew
that
he
knew
she
came
over
and
laid
a
hand
lightly
on
his
arm
i
do
know
anything
about
logic
it
is
a
plant
but
common
sense
is
a
field
flower
and
i
gathered
whole
bunches
of
it
in
my
years
of
business
experience
i
not
going
down
to
south
america
for
a
lark
i
going
because
the
time
is
ripe
to
go
going
because
the
future
of
our
business
needs
it
i
going
because
it
a
job
to
be
handled
by
the
most
experienced
salesman
on
our
staff
and
i
just
that
i
say
it
because
it
true
your
father
used
to
see
things
straighter
and
farther
than
any
business
man
i
ever
knew
since
his
death
made
me
a
partner
in
this
firm
i
find
myself
when
i
troubled
or
puzzled
trying
to
see
a
situation
as
he
see
it
if
he
were
alive
it
like
having
an
expert
stand
back
of
you
in
a
game
of
cards
showing
you
the
next
move
that
the
way
i
playing
this
hand
and
i
think
we
going
to
take
most
of
the
tricks
away
from
fat
ed
meyers
buck
eyes
traveled
from
emma
mcchesney
earnest
glowing
face
to
the
hand
that
rested
on
his
arm
he
reached
over
and
gently
covered
that
hand
with
his
own
i
suppose
you
must
be
right
little
woman
you
always
are
dad
was
the
founder
of
this
business
it
was
the
pride
of
his
life
that
word
has
two
meanings
i
never
want
to
be
responsible
for
its
second
meaning
in
connection
with
this
concern
you
never
will
be
t
a
not
with
you
at
the
helm
he
smiled
rather
sadly
i
a
good
ordinary
common
seaman
but
you
got
imagination
and
foresight
and
nerve
and
daring
and
that
the
stuff
that
admirals
are
made
of
bless
you
i
knew
you
see
the
thing
as
i
do
after
the
first
shock
was
over
it
has
always
been
nip
and
tuck
between
the
company
and
us
you
gave
me
the
hint
that
showed
me
their
plans
now
help
me
follow
it
up
buck
picked
up
his
hat
squared
his
shoulders
and
fumbled
with
his
gloves
like
a
bashful
schoolboy
you
you
could
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
on
this
trip
could
you
mrs
mack
mcchesney
back
at
her
desk
again
threw
him
an
inquiring
glance
over
her
shoulder
you
might
make
it
a
combination
honeymoon
and
featherloom
expedition
a
buck
exclaimed
emma
mcchesney
then
as
buck
dodged
for
the
door
just
for
that
i
going
to
break
this
to
you
you
know
that
i
intended
to
handle
the
middle
western
territory
for
one
trip
or
until
we
could
get
a
man
to
take
fat
ed
meyers
place
well
said
buck
apprehensively
i
leave
in
three
days
goodness
knows
how
long
i
be
gone
a
business
deal
down
there
is
a
ceremony
and
you
wo
need
any
clothes
in
rock
island
illinois
buck
aghast
faced
her
from
the
doorway
you
mean
i
just
that
smiled
emma
mcchesney
pleasantly
and
pressed
the
button
that
summoned
the
stenographer
in
the
next
hours
mcchesney
performed
a
series
of
mental
and
physical
calisthenics
that
would
have
landed
an
ordinary
woman
in
a
sanatorium
she
cleaned
up
with
the
thoroughness
and
dispatch
of
a
housewife
who
before
going
to
the
seashore
forgets
not
instructions
to
the
iceman
the
milkman
the
janitor
and
the
maid
she
surveyed
her
territory
behind
and
before
as
a
general
studies
troops
and
countryside
before
going
into
battle
she
foresaw
factory
emergencies
dictated
office
policies
made
sure
of
staff
organization
like
the
business
woman
she
was
out
in
the
under
her
supervision
there
was
scientifically
packed
into
and
cases
a
line
of
featherloom
skirts
and
knickers
calculated
to
dazzle
brazil
and
entrance
argentina
and
into
her
own
personal
trunk
there
went
a
wardrobe
each
article
of
which
was
a
garment
with
a
purpose
emma
mcchesney
knew
the
value
of
a
smartly
tailored
suit
in
a
business
argument
buck
canceled
his
order
at
the
tailor
made
up
his
own
line
for
the
middle
west
and
prepared
to
storm
that
prosperous
and
important
territory
for
the
first
time
in
his
business
career
the
south
american
boat
sailed
saturday
afternoon
saturday
morning
found
the
two
partners
deep
in
one
of
those
condensed
discussions
mcchesney
opened
a
desk
drawer
took
out
a
pocket
notebook
and
handed
it
to
buck
a
tiny
smile
quivered
about
her
lips
buck
took
it
mystified
your
last
diary
something
much
more
important
i
call
it
salesman
who
who
read
it
as
you
ought
your
bible
but
what
buck
turned
the
pages
wonderingly
he
glanced
at
a
paragraph
frowned
read
it
aloud
slowly
des
moines
iowa
klein

miss
ella
sweeney
skirt
buyer
old
girl
skittish
wants
to
be
entertained
take
her
to

and
the
theater
he
looked
up
dazed
good

what
is

a
joke
wait
until
you
see
ella
you
wo
think
it
a
joke
she
buy
only
your
smoothest
numbers
ask
sixty
days
dating
and
expect
you
to
entertain
her
as
you
would
your
rich
aunt
buck
returned
to
the
little
book
dazedly
he
flipped
another
leaf
another
then
he
read
in
a
stunned
sort
of
voice
sam

emporium
duluth
see
sadie
he
closed
the
book
say
see
here
emma
do
you

sam

the
manager
interrupted
mcchesney
pleasantly
and
he
thinks
he
does
the
buying
but
the
brains
of
that
business
is
a
little
girl
named
sadie
harris
she
a
wonder
five
years
from
now
if
she
does
marry
sam
she
be
one
of
those
foreign
buyers
play
your
samples
up
to
sammy
but
quote
your
prices
down
to
sadie
read
the
next
one
t
a
buck
read
on
his
tone
lifeless
miss
sharp
berg
brothers
omaha
strictly
business
known
among
the
trade
as
the
human
cactus
canceled
a
order
once
because
the
grateful
salesman
called
her
stick
to
skirts
buck
slapped
the
book
smartly
against
the
palm
of
his
hand
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
made
this
book
out
for
me
do
you
mean
to
say
that
i
have
to
cram
on
this
like
a
kid
studying
for
exams
that
i
have
to
cater
to
the
personality
of
the
person
i
selling
to
why
it
it
emma
mcchesney
nodded
calmly
i
do
know
how
this
trip
of
yours
is
going
to
affect
the
business
a
but
it
going
to
be
a
liberal
education
for
you
you
find
that
you
need
that
little
book
a
good
many
times
before
you
through
and
while
you
following
its
advice
do
this
forget
that
your
name
is
buck
except
for
business
purposes
forget
that
your
family
has
always
lived
in
a
brownstone
mausoleum
in
street
forget
that
you
like
your
chops
done
just
so
and
your
wine
at
a
temperature
get
close
to
your
trade
they
an
awfully
human
lot
those
middle
western
buyers
do
chuck
them
under
the
chin
but
smile
on
and
you
got
a
lovely
smile
t
a
buck
looked
up
from
the
little
leather
book
and
as
he
gazed
at
emma
mcchesney
the
smile
appeared
and
justified
its
praise
i
have
this
to
comfort
me
anyway
emma
i
know
that
while
smirking
on
the
sprightly
miss
sweeney
your
face
will
be
undergoing
various
agonizing
twists
in
the
effort
to
make
american
prices
understood
by
an
argentine
who
ca
speak
anything
but
spanish
maybe
i
am
short
on
spanish
but
i
long
on
featherlooms
i
may
not
know
a
senora
from
a
chili
con
carne
but
i
know
featherlooms
from
the
waistband
to
the
hem
she
leaned
forward
dimpling
like
fourteen
instead
of
forty
and
you
noticed
have
you
t
that
got
an
expressive
countenance
buck
leaned
forward
too
his
smile
was
almost
gone
i
noticed
a
lot
of
things
emma
mcchesney
and
if
you
persist
in
deviling
me
for
one
more
minute
i
going
to
mention
a
few
emma
mcchesney
surveyed
her
cleared
desk
locked
the
top
drawer
with
a
snap
and
stood
up
if
you
do
i
miss
my
boat
just
time
to
make
brooklyn
suppose
you
write
that
ed
meyers
might
know
nothing
of
her
sudden
plans
she
had
kept
the
trip
secret
besides
buck
and
the
office
staff
her
son
jock
was
the
only
one
who
knew
but
she
found
her
cabin
stocked
like
a
prima
donna
on
a
farewell
tour
there
were
boxes
of
flowers
a
package
of
books
baskets
of
fruit
piles
of
magazines
even
a
neat
little
sheaf
of
telegrams
one
from
the
faithful
bookkeeper
one
from
the
workroom
foreman
two
from
salesmen
long
in
the
firm
employ
two
from
jock
in
chicago
she
read
them
her
face
glowing
he
and
buck
had
vied
with
each
other
in
supplying
her
with
luxuries
that
would
make
pleasanter
the
days
of
her
voyage
she
looked
about
the
snug
cabin
her
eyes
suddenly
misty
buck
poked
his
head
in
at
the
door
come
on
up
on
deck
emma
i
only
a
few
minutes
left
she
snatched
a
pink
rose
from
the
box
and
together
they
went
on
deck
just
ten
minutes
said
buck
he
was
looking
down
at
her
remember
emma
nothing
that
concerns
the
firm
business
however
big
is
half
as
important
as
the
things
that
concern
you
personally
however
small
i
realize
what
this
trip
will
mean
to
us
if
it
pans
and
if
you
can
beat
meyers
to
it
but
if
anything
should
happen
to
you
why
nothing
going
to
happen
except
that
i
probably
come
home
with
my
complexion
ruined
i
feel
a
great
deal
more
at
home
talking
to
senor
alvarez
in
buenos
aires
than
you
will
talking
featherlooms
to
miss
in
cedar
rapids
iowa
but
remember
this
when
you
get
to
know
really
to
know
the
sadie
harrises
and
the
sammy
blochs
and
the
ella
sweeneys
of
this
world
learned
just
about
all
there
is
to
know
about
human
beings
quick
the
gangplank
goodby
t
a
the
dock
reached
he
gazed
up
at
her
as
she
leaned
far
over
the
railing
he
made
a
megaphone
of
his
hands
i
feel
like
an
old
maid
who
staying
home
with
her
knitting
he
called
the
boat
began
to
move
emma
mcchesney
passed
a
quick
hand
over
her
eyes
do
drop
any
stitches
t
a
with
unerring
aim
she
flung
the
big
pink
rose
straight
at
him
she
went
about
arranging
her
affairs
on
the
boat
like
the
business
woman
that
she
was
first
she
made
her
cabin
shipshape
she
placed
nearest
at
hand
the
books
on
south
america
and
the
pocket
interpreter
she
located
her
deck
chair
and
her
seat
in
the
then
quietly
unobtrusively
and
guided
by
those
years
spent
in
meeting
men
and
women
face
to
face
in
business
she
took
thorough
conscientious
mental
stock
of
those
others
who
were
to
be
her
fellow
travelers
for
days
for
the
most
part
the
passengers
were
men
there
were
american
business
men
salesmen
some
of
them
promoters
others
or
representatives
of
big
syndicates
shrewd
alert
well
dressed
smooth
shaven
emma
mcchesney
knew
that
she
would
gain
valuable
information
from
many
of
them
before
the
trip
was
over
she
sighed
a
little
regretfully
as
she
thought
of
those
talks
those
intimate
business
talks
from
which
she
would
be
barred
by
her
sex
there
were
two
engineers
one
british
one
american
both
very
both
inclined
to
taciturnity
as
is
often
the
case
in
men
of
their
profession
they
walked
a
good
deal
and
smoked
pipes
and
stared
unblinkingly
across
the
water
there
were
argentines
whole
families
of
them
brazilians
too
the
fat
bejeweled
brazilian
men
eyed
emma
mcchesney
with
open
approval
even
talked
to
her
leering
objectionably
emma
mcchesney
refused
to
be
annoyed
her
ten
years
on
the
road
served
her
in
good
stead
now
but
most
absorbing
of
all
to
emma
mcchesney
watching
quietly
over
her
book
or
magazine
was
a
tall
erect
argentine
who
with
his
family
occupied
chairs
near
hers
his
name
had
struck
her
with
the
sound
of
familiarity
when
she
read
it
on
the
passenger
list
she
had
asked
the
to
point
out
the
name
owner
pages
she
repeated
to
herself
worriedly
pages
p
suddenly
she
knew
pages
y
hernandez
the
owner
of
the
great
buenos
aires
shop
a
shop
finer
than
those
of
paris
and
this
was
pages
all
the
featherloom
instinct
in
emma
mcchesney
came
to
the
surface
and
stayed
there
seething
that
was
the
morning
of
the
second
day
out
by
afternoon
she
had
bribed
and
maneuvered
so
that
her
deck
chair
was
next
that
of
the
flock
of
chairs
senor
pages
reminded
her
of
one
of
those
dashing
men
whose
likeness
graces
the
cover
of
a
box
of
your
favorite
cigars
general
he
should
have
been
with
a
revolutionary
background
he
dressed
somberly
in
black
like
most
of
the
other
argentine
men
on
board
there
was
senora
pages
very
fat
very
indolent
very
blank
much
given
to
pink
satin
and
diamonds
at
dinner
senorita
pages
overfrizzed
marvelously
gowned
with
overplumpness
just
a
few
years
away
sat
quietly
by
senora
pages
side
but
her
darting
flashing
restless
eyes
were
never
still
the
son
emma
heard
them
call
him
pepe
was
barely
eighteen
she
thought
but
quite
a
man
of
the
world
with
his
cigarettes
his
drinks
his
bold
eyes
she
looked
at
his
sallow
pimpled
skin
his
lean
brown
hands
his
eyes
and
she
thought
of
jock
and
was
happy
mcchesney
knew
that
she
might
visit
the
magnificent
buenos
aires
shop
of
pages
y
hernandez
day
after
day
for
months
without
ever
obtaining
a
glimpse
of
either
pages
or
hernandez
and
here
was
senor
pages
so
near
that
she
could
reach
out
and
touch
him
from
her
deck
chair
here
was
opportunity
a
caller
who
had
never
been
obliged
to
knock
twice
at
emma
mcchesney
door
her
methods
were
so
simple
that
she
herself
smiled
at
them
she
donned
her
choicest
suit
of
white
serge
that
she
had
been
saving
for
shore
wear
its
skirt
had
been
cut
by
the
very
newest
trick
its
coat
was
the
kind
to
make
you
go
home
and
get
out
your
own
white
serge
and
gaze
at
it
with
loathing
senorita
pages
eyes
leaped
to
that
suit
as
iron
leaps
to
the
magnet
emma
mcchesney
passing
her
deck
chair
detached
the
eyes
with
a
neat
smile
why
had
she
spent
six
months
neglecting
skirts
for
spanish
she
asked
herself
groaning
as
she
approached
her
own
deck
chair
again
she
risked
a
bright
good
morning
her
heart
bounded
stood
still
bounded
again
as
from
the
lips
of
the
assembled
pages
there
issued
a
combined
courteous
perfectly
good
american
good
morning
you
speak
english
emma
mcchesney
tone
expressed
flattery
and
surprise
pages
pere
made
answer
ah
yes
it
is
necessary
there
are
many
english
in
argentina
a
sigh
a
fluttering
tremulous
sigh
of
perfect
peace
and
happiness
welled
up
from
emma
mcchesney
heart
and
escaped
through
her
smiling
lips
by
noon
senorita
pages
had
tried
on
the
fascinating
coat
and
secured
the
address
of
its
builder
by
afternoon
emma
mcchesney
was
showing
the
newest
embroidery
stitch
to
the
slow
but
docile
senora
pages
next
morning
she
was
playing
shuffleboard
with
the
elegant
indolent
pepe
and
talking
north
american
football
and
baseball
to
him
she
had
not
been
jock
mcchesney
mother
all
those
years
for
nothing
she
could
discuss
sports
with
the
best
of
them
young
pages
was
avidly
interested
outdoor
sports
had
become
the
recent
fashion
among
the
rich
young
argentines
the
problem
of
papa
pages
was
not
so
easy
emma
mcchesney
approached
her
subject
warily
skirting
the
bypaths
of
politics
war
climate
customs
to
business
business
but
a
lady
as
charming
as
you
can
understand
nothing
of
business
said
senor
pages
business
is
for
your
militant
sisters
but
we
american
women
do
understand
business
many
many
charming
american
women
are
in
business
senor
pages
turned
his
fine
eyes
upon
her
she
had
talked
most
interestingly
this
pretty
american
woman
perhaps
but
pardon
me
if
i
think
not
a
woman
can
not
be
really
charming
and
also
capable
in
business
emma
mcchesney
dimpled
becomingly
but
i
know
a
woman
who
is
as
well
as
charming
as
you
say
i
am
still
she
is
known
as
a
capable
successful
business
woman
be
in
buenos
aires
when
i
am
senor
pages
shook
an
unbelieving
head
emma
mcchesney
leaned
forward
will
you
let
me
bring
her
in
to
meet
you
just
to
prove
my
point
she
must
be
as
charming
as
you
are
his
argentine
betting
proclivities
rose
here
we
shall
make
a
wager
he
took
a
card
from
his
pocket
scribbled
on
it
handed
it
to
emma
mcchesney
you
will
please
present
that
to
my
secretary
who
will
conduct
you
immediately
to
my
office
we
will
pretend
it
is
a
friendly
call
your
friend
need
not
know
if
i
lose
if
you
lose
you
must
promise
to
let
her
show
you
her
sample
line
but
dear
madam
i
do
no
buying
then
you
must
introduce
her
favorably
to
the
department
buyer
of
her
sort
of
goods
but
if
i
win
persisted
senor
pages
if
she
is
as
charming
as
as
you
say
i
am
you
may
make
your
own
terms
senor
pages
fine
eyes
opened
wide
it
was
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
their
trip
that
they
came
into
quaint
bahia
the
stay
there
was
short
brazilian
business
methods
are
long
emma
mcchesney
took
no
chances
with
or
cases
she
packed
her
three
leading
samples
into
her
own
personal
suitcase
eluded
the
other
tourists
secured
an
interpreter
and
prepared
to
brave
bahia
she
returned
just
in
time
to
catch
the
boat
flushed
tired
and
orderless
bahia
would
have
none
of
her
in
three
days
they
would
reach
rio
de
janeiro
the
magnificent
they
would
have
three
days
there
she
told
herself
that
bahia
did
count
anyway
sleepy
little
town
but
the
arrow
rankled
it
had
been
the
first
to
penetrate
the
armor
of
her
business
success
but
she
had
learned
things
from
that
experience
at
bahia
she
had
learned
that
the
south
american
dislikes
the
north
american
because
his
northern
cousin
patronizes
him
she
learned
that
the
north
american
business
firm
is
thought
by
the
southern
business
man
to
be
tricky
and
dishonest
and
that
because
the
northerner
has
not
learned
how
to
pack
a
case
of
goods
scientifically
as
have
the
english
germans
and
french
the
south
american
rages
to
pay
rates
on
boxes
that
are
empty
so
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
but
a
knowing
head
that
she
faced
rio
de
janeiro
they
had
entered
in
the
evening
the
sunset
splashing
the
bay
and
the
hills
in
the
foreground
and
the
mountain
with
an
unbelievable
riot
of
crimson
and
gold
and
orange
and
blue
suddenly
the
sun
jerked
down
as
though
pulled
by
a
string
and
the
magic
purple
night
came
up
as
though
pulled
by
another
well
anyway
i
seen
that
breathed
emma
mcchesney
thankfully
next
morning
she
packed
her
three
samples
as
before
her
heart
heavy
her
mind
on
fat
ed
meyers
coming
up
two
weeks
behind
her
three
days
in
rio
and
already
she
had
bumped
her
impatient
north
american
business
head
up
against
the
stone
wall
of
south
american
leisureliness
and
prejudice
she
meant
no
irreverence
no
impiety
as
she
prayed
meanwhile
packing
nos
and
into
her
personal
bag
o
lord
let
fat
ed
meyers
have
bahia
but
please
please
help
me
to
land
rio
and
buenos
aires
then
in
smart
tailored
suit
and
hat
interpreter
in
tow
a
prayer
in
her
heart
and
excitement
blazing
in
cheeks
and
eyes
she
made
her
way
to
the
dock
through
the
customs
into
a
cab
that
was
to
take
her
to
her
arena
the
broad
avenida
exactly
two
hours
later
there
dashed
into
the
a
woman
whose
hat
was
very
much
over
one
ear
she
was
running
as
only
a
woman
runs
when
she
made
up
her
mind
to
get
there
she
came
regardless
of
modishly
crippling
skirt
past
officers
past
customs
officials
into
the
section
where
stood
the
one
small
that
she
had
ordered
down
in
case
of
emergency
the
trunk
had
not
gone
through
the
customs
it
had
not
even
been
opened
but
emma
mcchesney
heeded
not
trifles
like
that
rio
de
janeiro
had
fallen
for
featherlooms
those
three
samples
nos
and
that
boasted
style
cut
and
workmanship
never
before
seen
in
rio
had
turned
the
trick
they
were
as
a
taste
of
blood
to
a
hungry
lion
rio
wanted
more
emma
mcchesney
was
kneeling
before
her
trunk
had
whipped
out
her
key
unlocked
it
and
was
swiftly
selecting
the
numbers
wanted
from
the
trays
her
breath
coming
quickly
her
deft
fingers
choosing
unerringly
when
an
indignant
voice
said
in
portuguese
it
is
forbidden
emma
mcchesney
did
not
glance
around
her
head
was
buried
in
the
depths
of
the
trunk
but
her
quick
ears
had
caught
the
word
prohiba
speak
english
she
said
and
went
on
unpacking
ingles
shouted
the
official
no
then
with
a
superhuman
effort
as
emma
mcchesney
stood
up
her
arms
laden
with
featherloom
samples
of
rainbow
hues
pare
mcchesney
slammed
down
the
trunk
top
locked
it
clutched
her
samples
firmly
and
faced
the
enraged
official
go
i
have
time
to
be
arrested
this
morning
this
is
my
busy
day
call
around
this
evening
whereupon
she
fled
to
her
waiting
cab
leaving
behind
her
a
brazilian
official
stunned
and
raging
by
turns
when
she
returned
happy
triumphant
he
was
standing
there
stunned
no
longer
but
raging
still

mcchesney
had
forgotten
all
about
him
the
official
advanced
mustachios
bristling
a
volley
of
portuguese
burst
from
his
lips
emma
mcchesney
glanced
behind
her
her
interpreter
threw
up
helpless
hands
replying
with
a
still
more
terrifying
burst
of
vowels
bewildered
a
little
frightened
mcchesney
stood
helplessly
by
the
official
laid
a
none
too
gentle
hand
on
her
shoulder
a
little
group
of
lesser
officials
stood
fashion
in
the
background
and
then
emma
mcchesney
new
york
training
came
to
her
aid
she
ignored
the
voluble
interpreter
she
remained
coolly
unruffled
by
the
fusillade
of
portuguese
quietly
she
opened
her
hand
bag
and
plunged
her
fingers
deep
deep
therein
her
blue
eyes
gazed
confidingly
up
into
the
brazilian
snapping
black
ones
and
as
she
withdrew
her
hand
from
the
depths
of
her
purse
there
passed
from
her
white
fingers
to
his
brown
ones
that
which
is
the
esperanto
of
the
nations
the
universal
language
understood
from
broadway
to
brazil
the
hand
on
her
shoulder
relaxed
and
fell
away
on
deck
once
more
she
encountered
the
suave
senor
pages
he
stood
at
the
rail
surveying
rio
shores
with
that
contempt
of
the
argentine
for
everything
brazilian
he
regarded
emma
radiant
face
you
are
pleased
with
this
this
indian
rio
mcchesney
paused
to
gaze
with
him
at
the
receding
shores
like
it
i
afraid
i
have
seen
it
from
here
it
looks
like
coney
but
it
buys
like
seattle
like
it
well
i
should
say
i
do
ah
senora
exclaimed
pages
distressed
wait
in
six
days
you
will
behold
buenos
aires
your
new
york
londres
paris
bah
you
shall
drive
with
my
wife
and
daughter
through
palermo
you
shall
see
jewels
motors
toilettes
as
never
before
and
you
will
visit
my
establishment
he
raised
an
emphatic
forefinger
but
surely
emma
mcchesney
regarded
him
solemnly
i
promise
to
do
that
you
may
rely
on
me
six
days
later
they
swept
up
the
muddy
and
majestic
plata
whose
color
should
have
won
it
the
name
of
river
of
gold
instead
of
river
of
silver
from
the
boat
upper
deck
emma
mcchesney
beheld
a
sky
line
which
was
so
like
the
sky
line
of
her
own
new
york
that
it
gave
her
a
shock
she
was
due
for
still
another
shock
when
an
hour
later
she
found
herself
in
a
maelstrom
of
motors
cabs
street
cars
newsboys
skyscrapers
pedestrians
policemen
subway
stations
where
was
the
south
american
languor
where
the
argentine
inertia
the
rush
and
roar
of
it
the
bustle
and
the
bang
of
it
made
the
voyage
seem
a
myth
i
going
to
shut
my
eyes
she
told
herself
and
then
open
them
quickly
if
that
little
brown
turns
out
to
be
a
big
then
i
right
and
this
is
broadway
and
shock
number
three
came
upon
her
entrance
at
the
grande
hotel
it
had
been
emma
mcchesney
boast
that
her
ten
years
on
the
road
had
familiarized
her
with
every
type
grade
style
shape
cut
and
mold
of
hotel
clerk
she
knew
him
from
the
knickerbocker
to
the
eagle
house
at
waterloo
iowa
at
the
moment
she
entered
the
grande
hotel
she
knew
she
had
overlooked
one
accustomed
though
she
was
to
the
sartorial
splendors
of
the
man
behind
the
desk
she
might
easily
have
mistaken
this
one
for
the
president
of
the
republic
in
his
glittering
uniform
he
looked
a
pass
between
the
supreme
chancellor
of
the
in
full
regalia
and
a
prince
of
india
during
the
durbar
he
was
regal
he
was
overwhelming
he
would
have
made
the
most
splendid
specimen
of
north
american
hotel
clerk
look
like
a
scullery
boy
mcchesney
spent
two
whole
days
in
buenos
aires
before
she
discovered
that
she
could
paralyze
this
personage
with
a
peso
a
peso
is
cents
her
experience
at
bahia
and
at
rio
de
janeiro
had
taught
her
things
so
for
two
days
haunted
as
she
was
by
visions
of
fat
ed
meyers
coming
up
close
behind
her
she
possessed
her
soul
in
patience
and
waited
on
the
great
firm
of
pages
y
hernandez
rested
the
success
of
this
expedition
when
she
thought
of
her
little
trick
on
senor
pages
her
blithe
spirits
sank
suppose
after
all
that
this
powerful
south
american
should
resent
her
little
yankee
joke
her
trunks
went
through
the
customs
she
secured
an
interpreter
she
arranged
her
samples
with
loving
care
style
cut
workmanship
she
ran
over
their
strong
points
in
her
mind
she
looked
at
them
as
a
mother
eyes
rest
fondly
on
the
shining
faces
the
hair
the
clean
pinafores
of
her
brood
and
her
heart
swelled
with
pride
they
lay
on
their
tables
the
artful
knickerbockers
the
gleaming
petticoats
the
pink
and
blue
pajamas
the
bifurcated
skirts
emma
mcchesney
ran
one
hand
lightly
over
the
navy
blue
satin
folds
of
a
sample
pages
or
no
pages
you
a
credit
to
your
mother
she
said
whimsically
up
in
her
room
once
more
she
selected
her
smartest
tailor
costume
her
most
modish
hat
the
freshest
of
gloves
and
blouses
she
chose
the
hours
between
four
and
six
when
wheel
traffic
was
suspended
in
the
calle
florida
and
throughout
the
the
narrow
streets
of
which
are
congested
to
the
point
of
suffocation
at
other
times
as
she
swung
down
the
street
they
turned
to
gaze
after
her
these
argentines
the
fat
senoras
turned
and
the
smartly
costumed
sallow
senoritas
and
the
men
all
of
them
they
spoke
to
her
these
last
but
she
had
expected
that
and
marched
on
with
her
free
swinging
stride
her
chin
high
her
color
very
bright
into
the
great
shop
of
pages
y
hernandez
at
last
up
to
the
private
offices
her
breath
coming
a
little
quickly
into
the
presence
of
the
shiny
secretary
shiny
teeth
shiny
hair
shiny
skin
shiny
nails
he
gazed
upon
emma
mcchesney
the
shine
gleaming
brighter
he
took
in
his
slim
brown
fingers
the
card
on
which
senor
pages
had
scribbled
that
day
on
board
ship
the
shine
became
dazzling
he
bowed
low
and
backed
his
way
into
the
office
of
senor
pages
a
successful
man
is
most
impressive
when
in
those
surroundings
which
have
been
built
up
by
his
success
on
shipboard
senor
pages
had
been
a
genial
charming
distinguished
fellow
passenger
in
his
luxurious
business
office
he
still
was
genial
charming
but
his
environment
seemed
to
lend
him
a
certain
austerity
senora
mcchesney
how
awful
that
sounds
emma
mcchesney
told
herself
we
spoke
of
you
but
last
night
and
now
you
come
to
win
the
wager
yes
he
smiled
but
shook
his
head
yes
replied
emma
mcchesney
and
tried
to
smile
too
senor
pages
waved
a
hand
toward
the
outer
office
she
is
with
you
this
business
friend
who
is
also
so
charming
oh
yes
said
emma
mcchesney
she
she
with
me
then
as
he
made
a
motion
toward
the
which
would
summon
the
secretary
no
do
do
that
wait
a
minute
from
her
bag
she
drew
her
business
card
presented
it
read
that
first
senor
pages
read
it
he
looked
up
then
he
read
it
again
he
gazed
again
at
emma
mcchesney
emma
mcchesney
looked
straight
at
him
and
tried
in
vain
to
remember
ever
having
heard
of
the
south
sense
of
humor
a
moment
passed
her
heart
sank
then
senor
pages
threw
back
his
fine
head
and
laughed
laughed
as
the
latin
laughs
emphasizing
his
mirth
with
many
ejaculations
and
gestures
ah
you
northerners
you
are
too
quick
for
us
come
i
myself
must
see
this
garment
which
you
honor
by
selling
his
glance
rested
approvingly
on
emma
mcchesney
trim
smart
figure
that
which
you
sell
it
must
be
quite
right
i
not
only
sell
it
said
emma
mcchesney
i
wear
it
that
how
is
it
you
northerners
say
ah
yes
that
settles
it
six
weeks
later
in
his
hotel
room
in
columbus
ohio
buck
sat
reading
a
letter
forwarded
from
new
york
and
postmarked
argentina
as
he
read
he
chuckled
grew
serious
chuckled
again
and
allowed
his
cigar
to
grow
cold
for
the
seventh
time
dear
they
fallen
for
featherlooms
the
way
an
eskimo
takes
to
my
letter
of
credit
is
all
shot
to
pieces
but
it
was
worth
it
they
make
you
pay
a
separate
license
fee
in
each
province
and
south
america
is
just
one
darn
province
after
another
if
they
lump
a
license
for
and
tell
you
to
go
ahead
it
would
be
cheaper
i
landed
pages
y
hernandez
by
a
trick
the
best
of
it
is
the
man
i
played
it
on
saw
the
point
and
laughed
with
me
we
north
americans
brag
too
much
about
our
sense
of
humor
i
thought
ten
years
on
the
road
had
hardened
me
to
the
most
fiendish
efforts
of
a
hotel
chef
but
the
food
at
the
grande
here
makes
a
round
steak
with
german
fried
look
like
sherry
latest
triumph
you
know
i
not
fussy
i
the
kind
of
woman
who
given
her
choice
of
ice
cream
or
cheese
for
dessert
will
take
cheese
here
given
my
choice
i
play
safe
and
take
neither
i
reached
the
point
where
i
make
a
meal
of
radishes
they
kill
their
beef
in
the
morning
and
serve
it
for
lunch
it
looks
and
tastes
like
an
ethiop
ear
but
i
do
care
because
i
getting
gorgeously
thin
if
the
radishes
hold
out
i
invade
central
america
and
panama
one
eye
on
valparaiso
already
i
know
it
sounds
wild
but
it
means
a
future
and
a
fortune
for
featherlooms
i
find
i
do
even
have
to
talk
skirts
they
but
i
have
to
talk
honesty
and
packing
how
did
you
hit
it
off
with
ella
sweeney
have
seen
a
sign
of
fat
ed
meyers
i
getting
nervous
do
you
think
he
may
have
exploded
at
the
equator
emma
but
kind
fortune
saw
fit
to
add
a
last
sweet
drop
to
emma
already
brimming
cup
as
she
reached
the
docks
on
the
day
of
her
departure
clad
in
cool
crisp
white
from
hat
to
shoes
her
quick
eye
spied
a
rotund
familiar
figure
disembarking
from
the
new
york
boat
just
arrived
the
fates
grinning
had
planned
this
moment
like
a
fat
ed
meyers
came
heavily
down
the
gangplank
his
hat
was
off
he
was
mopping
the
top
of
his
head
with
a
large
damp
handkerchief
his
gaze
swept
over
the
busy
darted
hither
and
thither
alighted
on
emma
mcchesney
with
a
shock
and
rested
there
a
distinct
little
shock
went
through
that
lady
too
but
she
waited
at
the
foot
of
her
boat
gangway
until
the
unbelievably
nimble
meyers
reached
her
he
was
a
fiery
spectacle
his
cheeks
were
distended
his
eyes
protuberant
he
wasted
no
words
they
understood
each
other
those
two
coming
or
going
going
replied
emma
mcchesney
clean
up
this
this
bonez
areez
too
absolutely
did
huh
meyers
stood
a
moment
panting
his
little
eyes
glaring
into
her
calm
ones
well
i
beat
you
in
bahia
anyway
he
boasted
emma
mcchesney
snapped
her
fingers
blithely
bah
for
bahia
she
took
a
step
or
two
up
the
gangplank
and
turned
ed
and
good
luck
i
can
recommend
the
radishes
but
pass
up
the
beef
dangerous
fat
ed
meyers
still
staring
began
to
stutter
unintelligibly
his
lips
moving
while
no
words
came
emma
mcchesney
held
up
a
warning
hand
do
do
that
ed
not
in
this
climate
a
man
of
your
build
too
i
surprised
consider
the
feelings
of
your
firm
fat
ed
meyers
glared
up
at
the
smiling
gracious
figure
his
hands
unclenched
the
words
came
oh
if
only
you
were
a
man
for
just
ten
minutes
he
moaned
ii
thanks
to
miss
morrissey
it
was
fat
ed
meyers
of
the
skirt
company
who
first
said
that
emma
mcchesney
was
the
maude
adams
of
the
business
world
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
his
being
called
to
the
carpet
for
his
failure
to
make
as
popular
as
emma
mcchesney
famed
featherlooms
he
spoke
in
heatedly
it
is
featherlooms
it
mcchesney
her
line
is
no
better
than
ours
it
her
personality
not
her
petticoats
she
got
a
following
that
swears
by
her
if
maude
adams
was
to
open
on
broadway
in
lynne
they
flock
to
see
her
would
they
well
emma
mcchesney
could
sell
i
telling
you
she
could
sell
bustles
she
could
sell
mittens
on
fifth
avenue
the
title
stuck
it
was
late
in
september
when
mcchesney
sunburned
decidedly
under
weight
but
gloriously
triumphant
returned
from
a
four
tour
of
south
america
against
the
earnest
protests
of
her
business
partner
buck
president
of
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
she
had
invaded
the
southern
continent
and
left
it
abloom
with
featherlooms
from
the
plata
to
the
canal
success
was
no
stranger
to
mcchesney
this
last
business
victory
had
not
turned
her
head
but
it
had
come
perilously
near
to
tilting
that
extraordinarily
part
a
certain
light
in
her
eyes
a
certain
set
of
her
chin
an
added
briskness
of
bearing
a
cocky
slant
of
the
eyebrow
revealed
the
fact
that
though
mcchesney
feet
were
still
on
the
ground
she
might
be
said
to
be
standing
on
tiptoe
when
she
had
sailed
from
brooklyn
pier
that
june
afternoon
four
months
before
she
had
cast
her
ordinary
load
of
business
responsibilities
on
the
unaccustomed
shoulders
of
buck
that
elegant
person
although
president
of
the
company
which
his
father
had
founded
had
never
been
its
real
head
when
trouble
threatened
in
the
workroom
it
was
to
mcchesney
that
the
forewoman
came
when
an
irascible
customer
in
green
bay
wisconsin
waxed
impatient
over
the
delayed
shipment
of
a
featherloom
order
it
was
to
emma
mcchesney
that
his
typewritten
protest
was
addressed
when
the
office
machinery
needed
mental
oiling
when
a
new
hand
demanded
to
be
put
on
instead
of
mercerized
when
a
consignment
of
turned
out
to
be
more
than
usually
metallic
it
was
in
emma
mcchesney
little
private
office
that
the
tangle
was
unsnarled
she
walked
into
that
little
office
now
at
nine
of
a
brilliant
september
morning
it
was
a
reassuring
room
bright
orderly
workmanlike
reflecting
the
personality
of
its
owner
she
stood
in
the
center
of
it
now
and
looked
about
her
eyes
glowing
lips
parted
she
raised
her
hands
high
above
her
head
then
brought
them
down
to
her
sides
again
with
an
unconsciously
dramatic
gesture
that
expressed
triumph
peace
content
relief
accomplishment
and
a
great
and
deep
satisfaction
buck
in
the
doorway
saw
the
gesture
and
understood
not
so
bad
to
get
back
to
it
is
it
bad
it
like
a
drink
of
cool
spring
water
after
too
much
champagne
in
those
miserable
south
american
hotels
how
i
used
to
long
for
the
orderliness
and
quiet
of
this
she
took
off
hat
and
coat
in
a
vase
on
the
desk
a
cluster
of
yellow
chrysanthemums
shook
their
shaggy
heads
in
welcome
emma
quick
eye
jumped
to
them
then
to
buck
who
had
come
in
and
was
surveying
the
scene
appreciatively
you
of
course
she
indicated
the
flowers
with
a
nod
and
a
radiant
smile
sorry
no
the
office
staff
did
that
there
a
card
of
welcome
i
believe
oh
said
emma
mcchesney
the
smile
was
still
there
but
the
radiance
was
gone
she
seated
herself
at
her
desk
buck
took
the
chair
near
by
she
unlocked
a
drawer
opened
it
rummaged
closed
it
again
unlocked
another
she
patted
the
flat
top
of
her
desk
with
loving
fingers
i
ca
help
it
she
said
with
a
little
shamed
laugh
i
so
glad
to
be
back
i
probably
hug
the
forewoman
and
bite
a
piece
out
of
the
first
featherloom
i
lay
hands
on
i
had
to
use
all
my
to
keep
from
kissing
jake
the
coming
up
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
emma
mcchesney
had
been
glancing
at
her
handsome
business
partner
she
had
found
herself
doing
the
same
thing
from
the
time
he
had
met
her
at
the
dock
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
before
those
four
months
had
wrought
some
subtle
change
but
what
where
she
frowned
a
moment
in
thought
then
is
that
a
new
suit
t
this
lord
no
last
summer
put
it
on
because
of
this
july
hangover
in
september
why
oh
i
do
know
vaguely
i
just
wondered
there
was
nothing
vague
about
buck
however
his
old
air
of
leisureliness
was
gone
his
very
attitude
as
he
sat
there
erect
brisk
confident
was
in
direct
contrast
to
his
old
graceful
indolence
i
like
to
go
over
the
home
grounds
with
you
this
morning
he
said
of
course
in
our
talk
last
night
we
did
cover
the
south
american
situation
thoroughly
but
your
letters
and
the
orders
told
the
story
you
carried
the
thing
through
to
success
it
marvelous
but
we
have
been
marking
time
during
your
absence
the
puzzled
frown
still
sat
on
emma
mcchesney
brow
as
though
thinking
aloud
she
said
have
you
grown
thinner
or
fatter
or
something
not
an
ounce
weighed
at
the
club
yesterday
he
leaned
forward
a
little
his
face
suddenly
very
sober
emma
i
want
to
tell
you
now
that
that
mother
she
i
lost
her
just
a
few
weeks
after
you
sailed
emma
mcchesney
gave
a
little
cry
she
came
quickly
over
to
him
and
one
hand
went
to
his
shoulder
as
she
stood
looking
down
at
him
her
face
all
sympathy
and
contrition
and
sorrow
and
you
did
write
me
you
did
even
tell
me
last
night
i
did
want
to
distress
you
i
knew
you
were
having
a
pull
down
there
without
additional
worries
it
happened
very
suddenly
while
i
was
out
on
the
road
i
got
the
wire
in
peoria
she
died
very
suddenly
and
quite
painlessly
her
companion
miss
tate
was
with
her
she
had
never
been
herself
since
dad
death
and
you
i
could
only
do
what
was
to
be
done
then
i
went
back
on
the
road
i
closed
up
the
house
and
now
i
leased
it
of
course
it
big
enough
for
a
regiment
but
we
stayed
on
because
mother
was
used
to
it
i
sold
some
of
the
furniture
but
stored
the
things
she
had
loved
she
left
some
to
you
to
me
you
know
she
used
to
enjoy
your
visits
so
much
partly
because
of
the
way
in
which
you
always
talked
of
dad
she
left
you
some
jewelry
that
she
was
fond
of
and
that
colossal
old
mahogany
buffet
that
you
used
to
rave
over
whenever
you
came
up
heaven
knows
what
you
do
with
it
it
a
white
elephant
if
you
add
another
story
to
it
you
could
rent
it
out
as
an
apartment
indeed
i
shall
take
it
and
cherish
it
and
polish
it
up
myself
every
week
the
beauty
she
came
back
to
her
chair
they
sat
a
moment
in
silence
then
emma
mcchesney
spoke
musingly
so
that
was
it
buck
looked
up
i
sensed
something
different
i
did
know
i
could
explain
it
buck
passed
a
quick
hand
over
his
eyes
shook
himself
sat
up
erect
and
brisk
again
and
plunged
with
a
directness
that
was
as
startling
as
it
was
new
in
him
into
the
details
of
middle
western
business
good
exclaimed
emma
mcchesney
it
all
very
well
to
know
that
featherlooms
are
safe
in
south
america
but
the
important
thing
is
to
know
how
they
going
in
the
corn
country
buck
stood
up
suppose
we
transfer
this
talk
to
my
office
all
the
papers
are
there
all
the
correspondence
all
the
orders
everything
you
can
get
the
whole
situation
in
half
an
hour
what
the
use
of
talking
when
figures
will
tell
you
he
walked
swiftly
over
to
the
door
and
stood
there
waiting
emma
mcchesney
rose
the
puzzled
look
was
there
again
no
that
was
it
after
all
she
said
eh
said
buck
was
what
nothing
replied
emma
mcchesney
i
this
morning
i
afraid
it
going
to
take
me
a
day
or
two
to
get
back
into
harness
again
if
you
rather
wait
if
you
think
you
be
more
fit
or
the
day
after
we
wait
there
no
real
hurry
i
just
thought
but
mcchesney
led
the
way
across
the
hall
that
separated
her
office
from
her
partner
halfway
across
she
stopped
and
surveyed
the
big
bright
busy
main
office
with
its
clacking
typewriters
and
rustle
and
crackle
of
papers
and
its
air
of
concentration
why
you
run
up
a
partition
there
between
miss
casey
desk
and
the
workroom
door
have
you
yes
it
much
better
that
way
yes
of
course
and
why
where
are
the
boys
desks
spalding
and
hutchinson
and
they
all
gone
she
turned
in
amazement
break
it
to
me
are
we
using
traveling
men
any
more
buck
laughed
his
low
pleasant
laugh
oh
yes
but
i
thought
their
desks
belonged
somewhere
else
than
in
the
main
office
they
now
installed
in
the
little
room
between
the
shop
and
healy
office
close
quarters
but
better
than
having
them
out
here
where
they
were
inclined
to
neglect
their
reports
in
order
to
shine
in
the
eyes
of
that
pretty
new
stenographer
there
are
one
or
two
other
changes
i
hope
you
approve
of
them
i
sure
i
shall
replied
emma
mcchesney
a
little
stiffly
in
buck
office
she
settled
back
in
her
chair
to
watch
him
as
he
arranged
neat
sheaves
of
papers
for
her
inspection
her
eyes
traveled
from
his
keen
eager
face
to
the
piles
of
paper
and
back
again
tell
me
did
you
hit
it
off
with
the
ella
sweeneys
and
the
sadie
harrises
of
the
great
middle
west
is
business
as
bad
as
the
howlers
say
it
is
you
said
something
last
night
about
a
novelty
bifurcated
skirt
was
that
the
new
designer
idea
how
have
the
early
buyers
taken
to
it
buck
crooked
an
elbow
over
his
head
in
stop
it
you
make
me
feel
like
rheims
cathedral
do
bombard
until
negotiations
fail
he
handed
her
the
first
sheaf
of
papers
but
before
she
began
to
read
i
say
this
much
miss
sharp
of
berg
brothers
omaha
the
one
you
warned
against
as
the
human
cactus
had
me
up
for
dinner
well
i
know
you
do
but
it
true
her
father
and
i
hit
it
off
just
like
that
he
a
character
that
old
boy
ever
meet
him
no
and
miss
sharp
told
me
something
about
herself
that
explains
her
porcupine
pose
that
poor
child
was
engaged
to
a
chap
who
was
killed
in
the
war
and
she
kate
sharp
interrupted
emma
mcchesney
why
buck
in
all
her
vinegary
narrow
life
that
girl
has
never
had
a
beau
much
less
buck
eyebrows
came
up
slightly
emma
mcchesney
you
have
developed
er
claws
have
you
with
a
gasp
emma
mcchesney
plunged
into
the
papers
before
her
for
ten
minutes
the
silence
of
the
room
was
unbroken
except
for
the
crackling
of
papers
then
emma
mcchesney
put
down
the
first
sheaf
and
looked
up
at
her
business
partner
is
that
a
fair
sample
she
demanded
very
answered
buck
and
handed
her
another
set
another
ten
minutes
of
silence
emma
mcchesney
reached
out
a
hand
for
still
another
set
of
papers
the
pink
of
repressed
excitement
was
tinting
her
cheeks
they
they
all
like
this
practically
yes
mcchesney
faced
him
her
eyes
wide
her
breath
coming
fast
buck
she
slapped
the
papers
before
her
smartly
with
the
back
of
her
hand
this
means
you
broken
our
record
for
middle
western
sales
yes
said
quietly
dad
would
have
enjoyed
a
morning
like
this
would
he
emma
mcchesney
stood
up
enjoyed
it
he
is
enjoying
it
do
tell
me
that
senior
just
because
he
is
no
longer
on
earth
has
failed
to
get
the
joy
of
knowing
that
his
son
has
realized
his
fondest
dreams
why
i
can
feel
him
here
in
this
room
i
can
see
those
bright
brown
eyes
of
his
twinkling
behind
his
glasses
not
know
it
of
course
he
knows
it
buck
looked
down
at
the
desk
smiling
curiously
know
i
felt
that
way
too
suddenly
emma
mcchesney
began
to
laugh
it
was
not
all
mirth
that
laugh
buck
waited
and
to
think
that
i
i
kindly
and
patronizingly
handed
you
a
little
book
full
of
tips
on
how
to
handle
western
buyers
who
who
i
who
used
to
think
i
was
the
witch
of
the
west
when
it
came
to
selling
you
on
your
first
have
made
me
look
like
like
a
peddler
buck
put
out
a
hand
suddenly
do
say
that
emma
i
somehow
it
takes
away
all
the
pleasure
it
true
and
now
that
i
know
it
explains
a
lot
of
things
that
been
puzzling
about
in
the
last
hours
what
kind
of
things
the
way
you
look
and
act
and
think
the
way
you
carry
your
head
the
way
you
sit
in
a
chair
the
very
words
you
use
your
gestures
your
intonations
they
different
buck
busy
with
his
cigar
laughed
a
little
oh
nonsense
he
said
you
imagining
things
which
remark
while
not
a
particularly
happy
one
certainly
was
not
in
itself
so
unfortunate
as
to
explain
why
mcchesney
should
have
turned
rather
suddenly
and
bolted
into
her
own
office
across
the
hall
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
buck
quite
cool
and
unruffled
viewed
her
sudden
departure
quizzically
then
he
took
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
stood
eying
it
a
moment
with
more
attention
perhaps
than
it
deserved
in
spite
of
its
fine
aroma
when
he
put
it
back
between
his
lips
and
sat
down
at
his
desk
once
more
he
was
smiling
ever
so
slightly
then
began
a
new
order
of
things
in
the
offices
of
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
feet
that
once
had
turned
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
toward
the
door
marked
mcchesney
now
took
the
direction
of
the
door
opposite
and
that
door
bore
the
name
of
buck
those
four
months
of
mcchesney
absence
had
put
her
partner
to
the
test
that
acid
test
had
washed
away
the
accumulated
dross
of
years
and
revealed
the
precious
metal
beneath
buck
had
proved
to
be
his
father
son
if
mcchesney
noticed
that
the
head
office
had
miraculously
moved
across
the
hall
if
her
sharp
ears
marked
that
the
many
feet
that
once
had
paused
at
her
door
now
stopped
at
the
door
opposite
if
she
realized
that
instead
of
i
like
your
opinion
on
this
mcchesney
she
often
heard
the
new
i
ask
buck
she
did
not
show
it
by
word
or
sign
the
first
of
october
found
buyers
still
flocking
into
new
york
from
every
state
in
the
country
shrewd
men
and
women
these
bargain
hunters
on
a
grand
scale
armed
with
the
long
spoon
of
business
knowledge
they
came
to
skim
the
cream
from
factory
and
workroom
products
set
forth
for
their
inspection
for
years
it
had
been
emma
mcchesney
quiet
boast
that
of
those
whose
business
brought
them
to
the
offices
and
showrooms
of
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
the
foremost
insisted
on
dealing
only
with
her
she
was
proud
of
her
following
she
liked
their
loyalty
their
preference
for
her
was
the
subtlest
compliment
that
was
in
their
power
to
pay
ethel
morrissey
whose
friendship
dated
back
to
the
days
when
emma
mcchesney
had
sold
featherlooms
through
the
middle
west
used
to
say
laughingly
her
plump
comfortable
shoulders
shaking
emma
if
you
ever
give
me
away
by
telling
how
many
years
i
been
buying
featherlooms
of
you
i
i
call
down
upon
you
the
curse
early
monday
morning
mcchesney
coming
down
the
hall
from
the
workroom
encountered
miss
ella
sweeney
of
klein
company
des
moines
iowa
stepping
out
of
the
elevator
a
very
skittish
miss
sweeney
rustling
preening
conscious
of
her
dangling
black
earrings
and
her
robespierre
collar
and
her
emma
mcchesney
met
this
apparition
with
outstretched
welcoming
hand
ella
sweeney
well
i
almost
given
you
up
you
late
this
fall
come
into
my
office
she
led
the
way
not
noticing
that
miss
sweeney
came
reluctantly
her
eyes
on
the
closed
door
across
the
way
sit
down
said
emma
mcchesney
and
pulled
a
chair
nearer
her
desk
no
wait
a
minute
let
me
look
at
you
now
ella
do
try
to
tell
me
that
that
dress
came
from
des
moines
iowa
do
i
why
child
distinctive
miss
sweeney
still
standing
smiled
a
pleased
but
rather
preoccupied
smile
her
eyes
roved
toward
the
door
emma
mcchesney
radiating
good
will
and
energy
went
on
wait
till
you
see
our
new
samples
you
buy
a
million
worth
just
let
me
lead
you
to
our
new
bifurcated
skirt
we
call
it
the
delight
she
put
a
hand
on
ella
arm
preparatory
to
guiding
her
to
the
showrooms
in
the
rear
but
miss
sweeney
strange
reluctance
grew
into
resolve
a
blush
as
real
as
it
was
unaccustomed
arose
to
her
bepowdered
cheeks
is
i
that
is
buck
is
in
i
suppose
buck
oh
yes
he
in
miss
sweeney
eyes
sought
the
closed
door
across
the
hall
is
that
his
office
emma
mcchesney
stiffened
a
little
her
eyes
narrowed
thoughtfully
you
have
guessed
it
she
said
crisply
buck
name
is
on
the
door
and
you
are
looking
at
it
miss
sweeney
looked
down
looked
up
twiddled
the
chain
about
her
neck
you
want
to
see
mr
buck
asked
emma
mcchesney
quietly
miss
sweeney
simpered
down
at
her
fluttered
her
eyelids
well
yes
i
i
you
see
i
bought
of
him
this
year
and
when
you
buy
of
a
person
why
naturally
you
naturally
i
understand
she
walked
across
the
hall
threw
open
the
door
and
met
glance
coolly
buck
miss
sweeney
of
des
moines
is
here
and
i
sure
you
want
to
see
her
this
way
miss
sweeney
miss
sweeney
sidling
blushing
fluttering
teetered
in
emma
mcchesney
just
before
she
closed
the
door
saw
a
little
spasm
cross
buck
face
it
was
gone
so
quickly
and
a
radiant
smile
sat
there
so
reassuringly
that
she
wondered
if
she
had
not
been
mistaken
after
all
he
had
advanced
hand
outstretched
with
miss
sweeney
it
it
wonderful
to
see
you
again
looking
the
closed
door
stifled
the
rest
emma
mcchesney
in
her
office
across
the
way
stood
a
moment
in
the
center
of
the
room
her
hand
covering
her
eyes
the
hardy
chrysanthemums
still
glowed
sunnily
from
their
vase
the
little
room
was
very
quiet
except
for
the
ticking
of
the
smart
clock
on
the
desk
the
closed
door
shut
out
factory
and
office
sounds
and
emma
mcchesney
stood
with
one
hand
over
her
eyes
so
napoleon
might
have
stood
after
waterloo
after
this
first
lesson
mcchesney
did
not
err
again
when
two
days
later
miss
sharp
of
berg
brothers
omaha
breezed
in
looking
strangely
juvenile
and
distinctly
anticipatory
emma
greeted
her
smilingly
and
waved
her
toward
the
door
opposite
miss
sharp
the
erstwhile
bristling
was
strangely
smooth
and
sleek
she
glanced
ever
so
softly
sighed
ever
so
flutteringly
working
side
by
side
with
him
seeing
him
day
after
day
how
have
you
been
able
to
resist
him
emma
mcchesney
was
only
human
after
all
by
remembering
that
this
is
a
business
house
not
a
matrimonial
parlor
the
dart
found
no
lodging
place
in
miss
sharp
sleek
armor
she
seemed
scarcely
to
have
heard
my
dear
she
whispered
his
eyes
and
his
manner
you
must
be
whatchamaycallit
adamant
is
that
the
way
you
pronounce
it
you
know
what
i
mean
oh
yes
replied
emma
mcchesney
evenly
i
know
what
you
mean
she
told
herself
that
she
was
justified
in
the
righteous
contempt
which
she
felt
for
this
sort
of
thing
a
a
cheap
whereupon
in
walked
sam
bloom
of
the
paris
emporium
duluth
one
of
mcchesney
stanchest
admirers
and
a
business
friend
the
usual
thing
younger
than
ever
mcchesney
you
a
wonder
yes
you
are
how
business
same
here
going
to
have
lunch
with
me
then
i
just
run
in
and
see
buck
say
he
been
keeping
himself
all
these
years
chip
off
the
old
block
that
boy
so
he
had
the
men
too
it
was
in
this
frame
of
mind
that
miss
ethel
morrissey
found
her
on
the
morning
that
she
came
into
new
york
on
her
ethel
morrissey
plump
quiet
with
her
hair
fast
graying
at
the
sides
had
nothing
of
the
skittish
middle
western
buyer
about
her
she
might
have
passed
for
the
mother
of
a
brood
of
six
if
it
were
not
for
her
eyes
the
shrewd
twinkling
reckoning
eyes
of
the
business
woman
she
and
emma
mcchesney
had
been
friends
from
the
day
that
ethel
morrissey
had
bought
her
first
cautious
bill
of
featherlooms
her
love
for
emma
mcchesney
had
much
of
the
maternal
in
it
she
felt
a
personal
pride
in
emma
mcchesney
work
her
success
her
clean
reputation
her
life
of
for
her
son
jock
when
ethel
morrissey
was
planned
by
her
maker
she
had
not
been
meant
to
be
wasted
on
the
department
of
a
store
that
broad
gracious
breast
had
been
planned
as
a
for
heads
in
need
of
comfort
those
plump
firm
arms
were
meant
to
enfold
the
weak
and
distressed
those
capable
hands
should
have
smoothed
troubled
heads
and
patted
plump
cheeks
instead
of
wasting
their
gifts
in
folding
piles
of
petticoats
and
deftly
twitching
a
plait
or
a
tuck
into
place
she
was
playing
rosalind
in
buskins
when
she
should
have
been
cast
for
the
nurse
she
entered
emma
mcchesney
office
now
in
her
quiet
blue
suit
and
her
neat
hat
and
she
looked
very
sane
and
cheerful
and
and
dependable
at
least
so
emma
mcchesney
thought
as
she
kissed
her
while
the
plump
arms
held
her
close
ethel
morrissey
the
hugging
process
completed
held
her
off
and
eyed
her
well
emma
mcchesney
flourish
your
featherlooms
for
me
i
want
to
buy
and
get
it
over
so
we
can
talk
are
you
sure
that
you
want
to
buy
of
me
asked
emma
mcchesney
a
little
wearily
what
the
joke
i
not
joking
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
might
prefer
to
see
buck
this
trip
ethel
morrissey
placed
one
forefinger
under
emma
mcchesney
chin
and
turned
that
lady
face
toward
her
and
gazed
at
her
long
and
thoughtfully
the
most
trying
test
of
courage
in
the
world
that
to
one
whose
eyes
fear
meeting
yours
emma
mcchesney
bravest
of
women
tried
to
withstand
it
and
failed
the
next
instant
her
head
lay
on
ethel
morrissey
broad
breast
her
hands
were
clutching
the
plump
shoulders
her
cheek
was
being
patted
soothingly
by
the
kind
hands
now
now
what
is
it
dear
tell
ethel
yes
i
do
know
but
tell
me
anyway
it
do
you
good
and
emma
mcchesney
told
her
when
she
had
finished
you
bathe
your
eyes
emma
and
put
on
your
hat
and
we
eat
oh
yes
you
will
a
cup
of
tea
anyway
is
there
some
little
cool
fool
place
where
i
can
be
comfortable
on
a
hot
day
like
this
where
we
can
talk
comfortably
i
got
at
least
an
hour
conversation
in
me
with
the
first
sip
of
her
first
cup
of
tea
ethel
morrissey
began
to
unload
that
burden
of
conversation
emma
this
is
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
you
oh
yes
it
is
the
queer
thing
about
it
is
that
it
did
happen
sooner
it
was
bound
to
come
you
know
emma
the
lord
lets
a
woman
climb
just
so
high
up
the
mountain
of
success
and
then
when
she
gets
too
cocky
when
she
begins
to
measure
her
wits
and
brain
and
strength
against
that
of
men
and
finds
herself
superior
he
just
taps
her
smartly
on
the
head
and
shins
so
that
she
stumbles
falls
and
rolls
down
a
few
miles
on
the
road
she
has
traveled
so
painfully
he
does
it
just
as
a
gentle
reminder
to
her
that
she
only
a
woman
after
all
oh
i
know
all
about
this
feminist
talk
but
this
thing
been
proven
look
at
what
happened
to
to
joan
of
arc
and
becky
sharp
and
mary
queen
of
scots
and
yes
i
have
been
spending
my
evenings
reading
now
stop
laughing
at
your
old
ethel
emma
mcchesney
you
meant
me
to
laugh
dear
old
thing
i
do
feel
much
like
it
though
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
reminded
of
my
lowly
state
heaven
knows
i
have
been
so
terrifically
pleased
with
myself
of
course
that
south
american
trip
was
well
gratifying
but
i
earned
it
for
ten
years
i
lived
with
head
in
a
did
i
i
worked
hard
enough
to
win
the
love
of
all
these
westerners
it
all
walking
dreamily
down
main
street
strewing
featherlooms
along
my
path
ethel
morrissey
stirred
her
second
cup
of
tea
sipped
stirred
smiled
then
reached
over
and
patted
emma
mcchesney
hand
emma
i
a
wise
old
party
and
i
can
see
that
it
is
all
pique
with
you
it
something
else
something
deeper
oh
yes
it
is
now
let
me
tell
you
what
happened
when
buck
invaded
your
territory
i
was
busy
up
in
my
department
the
morning
he
came
in
i
had
my
head
in
a
rack
of
coats
and
a
henny
customer
waiting
but
i
sensed
something
stirring
and
i
stuck
my
head
out
of
the
in
which
i
was
fumbling
the
department
was
aflutter
like
a
every
woman
in
it
from
the
little
new
swede
to
gladys
hemingway
who
is
only
working
to
wear
out
her
old
clothes
was
standing
with
her
face
toward
the
elevator
and
on
her
face
a
look
that
would
make
the
ordinary
marked
seem
like
an
insult
i
kind
of
smoothed
my
back
hair
because
i
knew
that
only
one
thing
could
bring
that
look
into
a
woman
face
and
down
the
aisle
came
a
tall
slim
wonderfully
tailored
fifth
avenue
person
with
eyes
of
course
i
knew
but
the
other
girls
did
they
just
sort
of
fell
back
at
his
approach
smitten
he
did
even
raise
an
eyebrow
to
do
it
now
emma
i
not
exaggerating
i
know
what
effect
he
had
on
me
and
my
girls
and
for
that
matter
every
other
man
or
woman
in
the
store
why
he
was
a
dream
realized
to
most
of
these
shrewd
clever
know
plenty
of
men
business
men
of
the
bluff
kind
the
kind
that
takes
you
out
to
dinner
and
blows
cigar
smoke
in
your
face
along
comes
this
chap
elegant
well
dressed
and
not
even
conscious
of
it
polished
suave
smooth
well
bred
why
when
he
spoke
to
a
girl
it
was
the
subtlest
kind
of
flattery
can
you
see
little
sadie
harris
of
duluth
drawing
a
mental
comparison
between
sam
bloom
the
and
this
fascinating
devil
sam
loud
voiced
it
around
the
sample
room
his
hat
pushed
back
on
his
head
chewing
his
cigar
like
mad
and
for
fear
buying
wrong
why
child
in
our
town
nobody
carries
a
cane
except
the
elks
when
they
have
their
annual
parade
and
old
man
schwenkel
who
lame
and
yet
we
all
accepted
that
yellow
of
buck
it
belonged
to
him
there
is
a
in
the
middle
west
that
does
dream
of
him
all
night
and
push
featherlooms
in
the
store
all
day
emma
i
old
and
fat
and
fifty
but
when
i
had
dinner
with
him
at
the
manitoba
house
that
evening
i
caught
myself
making
eyes
at
him
knowing
that
every
woman
in
the
would
have
given
her
front
teeth
to
be
where
i
was
after
which
extensive
period
ethel
morrissey
helped
herself
to
her
third
cup
of
tea
emma
mcchesney
relaxed
a
little
and
laughed
a
tremulous
little
laugh
oh
well
i
suppose
i
must
not
hope
to
combat
such
formidable
rivals
as
chamois
gloves
and
eyes
my
business
arguments
are
futile
compared
to
those
ethel
morrissey
delivered
herself
of
a
last
shot
you
wrong
emma
those
things
helped
him
but
they
did
sell
his
line
he
sold
featherlooms
out
of
salesmanship
and
because
he
sounded
convincing
and
sincere
and
businesslike
and
he
had
the
samples
it
was
all
bunk
it
was
business
those
two
make
an
invincible
combination
an
hour
later
ethel
morrissey
was
shrewdly
selecting
her
winter
line
of
featherlooms
from
the
stock
in
the
showrooms
of
the
buck
company
they
went
about
their
business
transaction
these
two
with
the
cool
abruptness
of
men
speaking
little
and
then
only
of
prices
discounts
dating
shipping
their
luncheon
conversation
of
an
hour
before
seemed
an
impossibility
you
have
dinner
with
me
emma
asked
up
at
my
apartment
all
cozy
not
dearie
i
be
in
bed
by
eight
i
not
the
girl
i
used
to
be
time
was
when
a
new
york
was
a
vacation
now
it
a
chore
she
took
emma
mcchesney
hand
and
patted
it
if
you
got
something
real
nice
for
dinner
though
and
feel
like
company
why
do
you
ask
somebody
else
that
lonesome
after
which
ethel
morrissey
laughed
her
wickedest
and
waved
a
sudden
with
a
last
word
about
seeing
her
emma
mcchesney
her
color
high
entered
her
office
it
was
five
she
cleared
her
desk
in
half
an
hour
breathed
a
sigh
of
weariness
reached
for
hat
and
jacket
donned
them
and
turning
out
her
lights
closed
her
door
behind
her
for
the
day
at
that
same
instant
buck
slammed
his
own
door
and
walked
briskly
down
the
hall
they
met
at
the
elevator
they
descended
in
silence
the
street
gained
they
paused
uncertainly
wo
you
stay
down
and
have
dinner
with
me
emma
thanks
so
much
a
not
i
sorry
good
night
good
night
she
turned
away
he
stood
there
in
the
busy
street
looking
irresolutely
and
not
at
all
eagerly
in
the
direction
of
his
club
perhaps
or
his
hotel
or
whatever
shelter
he
sought
after
business
hours
something
in
his
attitude
the
loneliness
of
it
the
uncertainty
the
indecision
smote
emma
mcchesney
with
a
great
pang
she
came
swiftly
back
i
wish
you
come
home
to
dinner
with
me
i
do
know
what
give
us
probably
bread
pudding
she
does
when
she
left
to
her
own
devices
but
i
i
wish
you
would
she
looked
up
at
him
almost
shyly
buck
took
emma
mcchesney
arm
in
a
rather
unnecessarily
firm
grip
and
propelled
her
surprised
and
protesting
in
the
direction
of
the
nearest
vacant
taxi
but
this
is
idiotic
why
take
a
cab
to
go
home
from
the
office
on
a
a
week
day
in
with
you
besides
i
never
have
a
chance
to
take
one
from
the
office
on
sunday
do
i
does
annie
always
cook
enough
for
two
apparently
annie
did
annie
was
something
of
a
witch
in
her
way
she
whisked
about
wrought
certain
changes
did
things
with
asparagus
and
mayonnaise
lighted
the
no
one
noticed
that
dinner
was
twenty
minutes
late
together
they
admired
the
great
mahogany
buffet
that
emma
had
miraculously
found
space
for
in
the
little
it
glows
like
a
great
deep
ruby
does
it
she
said
proudly
you
should
see
annie
circle
around
it
with
the
she
knows
one
bump
would
be
followed
by
instant
death
looking
back
on
it
afterward
they
remembered
that
the
dinner
was
a
very
silent
one
they
did
not
notice
their
wordlessness
at
the
time
once
when
the
chops
came
on
buck
said
absently
oh
i
had
those
for
l
then
he
stopped
abruptly
emma
mcchesney
smiled
your
mother
trained
you
well
she
said
the
october
night
had
grown
cool
annie
had
lighted
a
wood
fire
in
the
that
was
what
attracted
me
to
this
apartment
in
the
first
place
mcchesney
said
as
they
left
the
a
fireplace
a
practical
real
fireplace
in
a
new
york
apartment
have
signed
the
lease
if
the
plaster
had
been
falling
in
chunks
and
the
bathtub
had
been
zinc
that
because
fireplaces
mean
home
in
our
minds
said
buck
he
sat
looking
into
the
heart
of
the
glow
there
fell
another
of
those
comfortable
silences
i
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
know
i
been
acting
the
cat
ever
since
i
got
home
from
south
america
and
found
that
you
had
taken
charge
you
see
you
had
spoiled
me
the
thing
that
has
happened
to
me
is
the
thing
that
always
happens
to
those
who
assume
to
be
dictators
i
just
want
you
to
know
now
that
i
glad
and
proud
and
happy
because
you
have
come
into
your
own
it
hurt
me
just
at
first
that
was
the
pride
of
me
i
quite
over
that
now
you
not
only
president
of
the
buck
company
in
name
you
its
actual
head
and
that
as
it
should
be
long
live
the
king
buck
sat
silent
a
moment
then
i
had
to
do
it
emma
she
looked
up
you
have
a
wonderful
brain
said
buck
then
and
the
two
utterances
seemed
connected
in
his
mind
they
seemed
to
bring
no
great
satisfaction
to
the
woman
to
whom
he
addressed
them
however
she
thanked
him
dryly
as
women
do
when
their
brain
is
dragged
into
an
intimate
conversation
but
said
buck
and
suddenly
stood
up
looking
at
her
very
intently
it
is
for
your
mind
that
i
love
you
this
minute
i
love
you
for
your
eyes
emma
and
for
your
mouth
you
have
the
tenderest
most
mouth
in
the
world
and
for
your
hair
and
the
way
your
chin
curves
i
love
you
for
your
and
for
the
way
you
walk
and
talk
and
sit
for
the
way
you
look
at
me
and
for
the
way
you
look
at
me
he
reached
down
and
gathered
emma
mcchesney
the
alert
the
aggressive
the
capable
into
his
arms
quite
as
men
gather
the
clingingest
kind
of
woman
and
now
suppose
you
tell
me
just
why
and
how
you
love
me
and
emma
mcchesney
told
him
when
at
last
he
was
leaving
do
you
think
asked
emma
mcchesney
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
that
you
overdid
the
fascination
thing
just
the
least
leetle
bit
there
on
the
road
well
but
you
told
me
to
entertain
them
did
you
yes
reluctantly
but
i
did
tell
you
to
consecrate
your
life
to
the
ordinary
fat
traveling
man
will
never
be
able
to
sell
featherlooms
in
the
middle
west
again
they
wo
have
they
never
be
satisfied
with
anything
less
than
john
drew
after
this
emma
mcchesney
you
not
marrying
me
because
a
lot
of
overdressed
giggling
skittish
old
girls
have
taken
a
fancy
to
make
eyes
at
me
are
you
emma
mcchesney
stood
up
very
straight
and
tall
i
marrying
you
because
you
are
a
great
big
fine
upstanding
tender
wonderful
oh
well
then
that
all
right
broke
in
buck
a
little
tremulously
emma
mcchesney
face
grew
serious
but
promise
me
one
thing
a
promise
me
that
when
you
come
home
for
dinner
at
night
you
never
say
heavens
i
had
that
for
lunch
iii
a
closer
corporation
front
offices
resemble
back
kitchens
in
this
they
have
always
an
ear
at
the
keyhole
an
eye
at
the
crack
a
nose
in
the
air
but
between
the
ordinary
front
office
and
the
front
office
of
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
there
was
a
difference
the
employees
at
buck
from
emil
the
errand
boy
to
old
pop
henderson
who
had
started
as
errand
boy
himself
years
before
possessed
the
quality
of
loyalty
they
were
loyal
to
the
memory
of
old
man
buck
because
they
had
loved
and
respected
him
they
were
loyal
to
emma
mcchesney
because
she
was
emma
mcchesney
which
amounts
to
the
same
reason
they
were
loyal
to
buck
because
he
was
his
father
son
for
three
weeks
the
front
office
had
been
bewildered
from
bewilderment
it
passed
to
worry
a
worried
bewildered
front
office
is
not
an
efficient
front
office
ever
since
mcchesney
had
come
off
the
road
at
the
death
of
old
buck
to
assume
the
secretaryship
of
the
company
which
she
had
served
faithfully
for
ten
years
she
had
set
an
example
for
the
entire
establishment
she
was
the
pacemaker
every
day
of
her
life
she
figuratively
pressed
the
electric
button
that
set
the
wheels
to
whirring
at
nine
sharp
she
appeared
erect
brisk
alert
vibrating
energy
usually
the
office
staff
had
not
yet
swung
into
its
gait
in
a
desultory
way
it
had
been
getting
into
its
sateen
sleevelets
adjusting
its
uncovering
its
typewriter
opening
its
ledgers
bringing
out
its
files
then
down
the
hall
would
come
the
sound
of
a
firm
light
buoyant
step
an
electric
thrill
would
pass
through
the
front
office
then
the
sunny
sincere
good
morning
mrs
mcchesney
the
front
office
would
chorus
back
the
day
had
begun
for
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
hortense
the
blond
stenographer
engaged
to
the
noticed
it
first
the
psychology
of
that
is
interesting
hortense
knew
that
by
mcchesney
desk
would
be
clear
and
that
the
buzzer
would
summon
her
hortense
did
mind
taking
dictation
from
buck
though
his
method
was
hesitating
and
jerky
and
he
was
likely
to
employ
quite
casually
a
baffling
and
unaccustomed
word
over
which
hortense
scampering
pencil
would
pause
struggle
desperately
then
race
on
hortense
often
was
in
for
a
quick
furtive
session
with
her
after
one
of
t
a
periods
but
with
mcchesney
dictation
was
a
joy
she
knew
what
she
wanted
to
say
and
she
always
said
it
the
words
she
used
were
short
meaningful
words
she
never
used
received
when
she
could
use
got
hers
was
the
method
each
word
sharp
well
timed
efficient
imagine
then
hortense
staring
and
puzzled
at
a
floundering
hesitating
mcchesney
a
mcchesney
strangely
starry
as
to
eyes
strangely
dreamy
as
to
mood
decidedly
deficient
as
to
dictation
imagine
a
hortense
with
pencil
poised
in
air
a
full
five
minutes
waiting
until
mcchesney
should
come
to
herself
with
a
start
frown
smile
vaguely
pass
a
hand
over
her
eyes
and
say
let
me
see
where
was
i
we
find
on
referring
to
your
order
that
the
goods
you
mention
hortense
would
prompt
patiently
oh
yes
of
course
with
an
effort
hortense
was
beginning
to
grow
alarmed
in
buck
office
just
across
the
hall
the
change
was
quite
as
noticeable
but
in
another
way
his
leisurely
drawl
was
gone
his
deliberate
manner
was
replaced
by
a
brisk
one
his
words
were
brief
and
to
the
point
he
seemed
to
be
riding
on
the
crest
of
an
and
as
he
dictated
he
smiled
hortense
stood
it
for
a
week
then
she
unburdened
herself
to
miss
kelly
the
assistant
bookkeeper
miss
kelly
evinced
no
surprise
at
her
disclosures
i
was
just
talking
about
it
to
pop
yesterday
she
acts
worried
does
she
and
yet
not
exactly
worried
either
do
you
suppose
it
can
be
that
son
of
hers
what
his
name
jock
hortense
shook
her
head
no
he
all
right
she
had
a
letter
from
him
yesterday
he
got
a
grand
position
in
chicago
and
he
going
to
marry
that
girl
he
was
so
stuck
on
here
and
it
is
that
either
because
mcchesney
likes
her
i
can
tell
by
the
way
she
talks
about
her
i
ought
to
know
look
how
henry
ma
acted
toward
me
when
we
were
first
engaged
the
front
office
buzzed
with
it
it
crept
into
the
workroom
into
the
it
penetrated
the
frowsy
head
of
jake
the
as
the
days
went
on
and
the
tempo
of
the
front
office
slackened
with
that
of
the
two
bright
little
inner
offices
only
one
member
of
the
whole
staff
remained
unmoved
incurious
taciturn
pop
henderson
listened
one
scant
old
eyebrow
raised
knowingly
a
whimsical
screwing
up
his
wrinkled
face
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
hortense
with
that
display
of
temperament
so
often
encountered
in
young
ladies
of
her
profession
announced
in
desperation
that
if
this
thing
kept
on
she
was
going
to
forget
herself
and
jeopardize
her
position
by
demanding
to
know
outright
what
the
trouble
was
from
the
direction
of
pop
henderson
inky
retreat
there
came
the
sound
of
a
dry
chuckle
pop
henderson
had
been
chuckling
in
just
that
way
for
three
weeks
now
it
was
getting
on
the
nerves
of
his
colleagues
if
you
ever
spring
the
joke
that
kept
you
giggling
for
a
month
snapped
hortense
it
break
up
the
office
pop
henderson
removed
his
very
deliberately
passed
his
thin
cramped
old
hand
over
his
scant
gray
locks
to
his
bald
spot
climbed
down
stiffly
from
his
stool
ambled
to
the
center
of
the
room
and
head
cocked
like
a
knowing
old
brown
sparrow
regarded
the
pert
hortense
over
his
spectacles
and
under
his
spectacles
and
finally
through
his
spectacles
young
folks
now
began
pop
henderson
dryly
are
so
darned
cute
and
knowin
that
when
an
old
fellow
cuts
in
ahead
of
for
once
he
likes
to
hug
the
joke
to
himself
a
while
before
he
springs
it
there
was
no
acid
in
his
tone
he
was
beaming
very
benignantly
down
upon
the
little
blond
stenographer
you
say
that
mack
is
and
dreamy
and
that
young
acts
like
swallowed
an
electric
battery
well
when
it
comes
to
that
i
seen
you
many
a
time
when
you
did
know
any
one
was
lookin
just
sitting
there
at
your
typewriter
with
your
hands
kind
of
poised
halfway
and
your
lips
sort
of
parted
and
your
eyes
just
gazing
away
somewhere
off
in
the
distance
for
fifteen
minutes
at
a
stretch
and
out
there
in
the
henry
singing
like
a
whole
minstrel
troupe
all
day
long
when
he
is
whistlin
so
loud
you
can
hear
him
over
far
as
eighth
avenue
then
as
the
red
surged
up
through
the
girl
fair
skin
well
drawled
old
pop
henderson
and
the
dry
chuckle
threatened
again
why
pop
henderson
exploded
miss
kelly
from
her
cage
why
pop
henderson
in
those
six
words
the
brisk
and
miss
kelly
expressed
the
surprise
and
the
awed
conviction
of
the
office
staff
pop
henderson
trotted
over
to
the
drew
a
brimming
glass
drank
it
off
and
gave
vent
to
a
great
exhaust
of
breath
he
tried
not
to
strut
as
he
crossed
back
to
his
desk
climbed
his
stool
adjusted
his
and
with
a
last
throaty
chuckle
plunged
into
his
books
again
but
his
words
already
were
working
their
wonders
the
office
after
the
first
shock
was
flooded
with
a
new
atmosphere
a
subtle
pervasive
air
of
hushed
happiness
of
tender
solicitude
it
went
about
like
a
mother
who
has
found
her
child
asleep
at
play
and
who
steals
away
atiptoe
finger
on
lip
lips
smiling
tenderly
the
delicate
antennae
of
emma
mcchesney
mind
sensed
the
change
perhaps
she
read
something
in
the
glowing
eyes
of
her
hortense
perhaps
she
caught
a
new
tone
in
miss
kelly
voice
or
the
forewoman
perhaps
a
whisper
from
the
outer
office
reached
her
desk
the
very
afternoon
of
pop
henderson
electrifying
speech
mcchesney
crossed
to
buck
office
shut
the
door
after
her
lowered
her
voice
discreetly
and
said
they
on
what
makes
you
think
so
nothing
that
is
nothing
definite
no
just
a
buck
strolled
over
to
her
smiling
i
have
known
you
all
this
time
without
having
learned
that
reason
enough
and
if
they
really
do
know
i
glad
but
we
did
want
them
to
know
not
yet
until
until
just
before
the
buck
laid
his
hands
lightly
on
emma
mcchesney
shoulders
emma
mcchesney
promptly
reached
up
and
removed
them
there
you
are
exclaimed
buck
and
rammed
the
offending
hands
into
his
pockets
that
why
i
glad
they
know
if
they
really
do
know
i
no
actor
i
a
manufacturer
for
the
last
six
weeks
instead
of
being
allowed
to
look
at
you
with
the
expression
that
a
man
naturally
wears
when
he
looking
at
the
woman
he
going
to
marry
what
have
i
had
to
do
glare
that
what
scowl
act
like
a
captain
of
finance
when
i
felt
like
a
romeo
i
had
to
be
dry
terse
businesslike
when
i
was
bursting
with
adjectives
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
business
you
avoided
my
office
as
you
would
a
camp
you
greeted
me
with
a
air
when
dared
to
invade
yours
you
could
have
been
less
cordial
to
a
book
agent
if
it
were
for
those
two
hours
you
grant
me
in
the
evening
i
i
blow
up
with
a
loud
report
that
what
i
now
now
t
interrupted
emma
mcchesney
soothingly
and
patted
one
gesticulating
arm
it
has
been
a
bit
of
a
strain
for
both
of
us
but
you
know
we
agreed
it
would
be
best
this
way
we
ten
days
more
to
go
let
stick
it
out
as
we
begun
it
has
been
best
for
us
for
the
office
for
the
business
the
next
time
you
find
yourself
choked
up
with
a
stock
of
fancy
adjectives
write
a
sonnet
to
me
work
off
that
way
buck
stood
silent
a
moment
regarding
her
with
a
concentration
that
would
have
unnerved
a
woman
less
poised
emma
mcchesney
when
you
talk
like
that
so
coolly
so
evenly
so
so
darned
mentally
i
sometimes
wonder
if
you
really
do
say
it
a
because
you
do
mean
it
i
had
to
fight
for
most
of
my
happiness
i
never
before
found
it
ready
at
hand
always
had
to
dig
for
it
with
a
shovel
and
a
spade
and
a
pickax
and
then
blast
i
had
almost
twenty
years
of
that
from
the
time
i
was
eighteen
until
i
was
it
taught
me
to
take
my
happiness
seriously
and
my
troubles
lightly
she
shut
her
eyes
for
a
moment
and
her
voice
was
very
low
and
very
deep
and
very
vibrant
so
when
i
coolest
and
evenest
and
most
mental
you
may
know
that
struck
gold
a
great
glow
illumined
buck
fine
eyes
he
took
two
quick
steps
in
her
direction
but
emma
mcchesney
one
hand
on
the
warned
him
off
with
the
other
hey
wait
a
minute
pleaded
buck
ca
i
a
fitting
at
the
tailor
at
my
new
suit
wait
till
you
see
it
the
dickens
you
have
but
so
have
i
he
jerked
out
his
watch
at
it
the
suit
i
going
to
wear
when
i
travel
as
a
blushing
bridegroom
so
mine
and
look
here
we
ca
both
leave
this
place
for
a
fitting
it
absurd
if
this
keeps
on
it
will
break
up
the
business
we
have
to
get
married
one
at
a
time
or
at
least
get
our
trousseaux
one
at
a
time
what
your
suit
sort
of
brown
brown
so
mine
good
heavens
we
look
like
a
minstrel
troupe
buck
sighed
resignedly
if
i
telephone
my
tailor
that
i
ca
make
it
until
will
you
promise
to
be
back
by
that
time
yes
but
remember
if
your
bride
appears
in
a
skirt
that
sags
in
the
back
or
a
coat
that
bunches
across
the
shoulders
the
crime
will
lie
at
your
door
so
it
was
that
the
office
staff
began
to
wonder
if
after
all
pop
henderson
was
the
wizard
that
he
had
claimed
to
be
during
working
hours
mcchesney
held
rigidly
to
business
her
handsome
partner
tried
bravely
to
follow
her
example
if
he
failed
occasionally
perhaps
emma
mcchesney
was
not
so
displeased
as
she
pretended
to
be
a
business
discussion
deeply
interesting
to
both
was
likely
to
run
thus
buck
entering
her
office
briskly
papers
in
hand
mrs
mcchesney
ahem
i
have
here
a
letter
from
singer
french
columbus
ohio
they
ask
for
an
extension
they
had
ninety
days
that
enough
that
firm
slow
pay
and
always
will
be
until
old
singer
has
the
good
taste
and
common
sense
to
retire
it
is
because
the
stock
does
move
singer
simply
believes
in
not
paying
for
anything
until
he
has
to
if
i
were
you
i
write
him
that
this
is
a
business
house
not
a
charitable
institution
no
do
do
that
it
is
politic
but
you
know
what
i
mean
h
yes
a
silence
emma
that
a
fiendishly
becoming
gown
now
t
but
it
is
it
it
so
kind
of
loose
and
yet
clinging
and
those
white
things
buck
i
worn
this
thing
down
to
the
office
every
day
for
a
month
it
shines
in
the
back
besides
you
promised
not
to
oh
darn
it
all
emma
i
human
you
know
how
do
you
suppose
i
can
stand
here
and
look
at
you
and
not
emma
mcchesney
pressing
the
buzzer
that
summons
hortense
you
know
tim
i
do
exactly
hate
you
this
morning
either
but
business
is
business
stop
looking
at
me
like
that
then
to
hortense
in
the
doorway
just
take
this
letter
miss
french
columbus
ohio
dear
sirs
yours
of
the
tenth
at
hand
period
regarding
your
request
for
further
extension
we
wish
to
say
that
in
view
of
the
fact
buck
half
resentful
half
amused
wholly
admiring
would
disappear
but
hortense
eyes
demurely
cast
down
at
her
notebook
was
not
deceived
say
she
confided
to
miss
kelly
they
think
they
got
me
fooled
but
i
wise
do
i
know
when
henry
passes
through
the
office
here
from
the
he
looks
at
me
just
as
cool
and
indifferent
before
we
announced
it
we
had
you
all
guessing
we
but
i
can
see
something
back
of
that
look
that
the
rest
of
you
ca
get
well
when
buck
looks
at
her
i
can
see
the
same
thing
in
his
eyes
say
when
it
comes
to
seeing
the
through
the
fog
i
there
with
the
if
emma
mcchesney
held
herself
well
in
leash
during
the
busy
day
she
relished
her
happiness
none
the
less
when
she
could
allow
herself
the
full
savor
of
it
when
a
girl
of
eighteen
she
had
married
a
man
of
the
sort
that
must
put
whisky
into
his
stomach
before
the
machinery
of
his
day
would
take
up
its
creaking
round
out
of
the
degradation
of
that
marriage
she
had
emerged
triumphantly
sweet
and
unsullied
and
she
had
succeeded
in
bringing
her
son
jock
mcchesney
out
into
the
clear
sunlight
with
her
the
evenings
spent
with
buck
the
man
of
fine
instincts
of
breeding
of
proven
worth
of
rare
tenderness
filled
her
with
a
great
peace
and
happiness
when
doubts
assailed
her
it
was
not
for
herself
but
for
him
sometimes
the
fear
would
clutch
her
as
they
sat
before
the
fire
in
the
of
her
comfortable
little
apartment
she
would
voice
those
fears
for
the
very
joy
of
having
them
stilled
this
is
too
much
happiness
i
i
afraid
after
all
you
a
young
man
though
you
are
a
bit
older
than
i
in
actual
years
but
men
of
your
age
marry
girls
of
eighteen
you
handsome
and
you
brains
family
breeding
money
any
girl
in
new
york
would
be
glad
to
marry
you
those
tall
slim
exquisite
young
girls
young
and
well
bred
and
poised
and
fresh
and
sweet
and
lovable
you
see
them
every
day
on
fifth
avenue
exquisitely
dressed
entirely
desirable
they
make
me
feel
old
old
and
battered
i
sold
goods
on
the
road
i
fought
and
worked
and
struggled
and
it
has
left
its
mark
i
did
it
for
the
boy
god
bless
him
and
i
glad
i
did
it
but
it
put
me
out
of
the
class
of
that
girl
you
see
on
yes
emma
you
not
at
all
in
the
class
with
that
girl
you
see
every
day
on
fifth
avenue
fifth
avenue
full
of
her
hundreds
of
her
thousands
of
her
perhaps
five
years
ago
before
i
had
worked
side
by
side
with
you
i
might
have
been
attracted
by
that
girl
you
see
every
day
on
fifth
avenue
you
do
see
a
procession
of
emma
mcchesneys
every
day
on
fifth
avenue
not
by
a
long
shot
why
because
only
one
of
her
she
does
come
in
dozen
lots
i
know
that
that
girl
you
see
every
day
on
fifth
avenue
is
all
that
i
deserve
but
by
some
miracle
i
to
have
this
emma
mcchesney
woman
i
do
know
how
it
came
to
be
true
i
do
deserve
it
but
it
is
true
and
that
enough
for
me
emma
mcchesney
would
look
up
at
him
eyes
wet
mouth
smiling
you
balm
and
myrrh
and
incense
and
meat
and
drink
to
me
i
wish
i
had
words
to
tell
you
what
i
thinking
now
but
i
have
so
i
just
cover
it
up
we
both
know
it
there
and
i
tell
you
that
you
make
love
like
a
hero
yes
you
do
better
than
a
hero
because
in
the
films
the
heroine
always
has
to
turn
to
face
the
camera
which
makes
it
necessary
for
him
to
make
love
down
the
back
of
her
neck
but
buck
was
unsmiling
do
trifle
emma
and
do
think
you
can
fool
me
that
way
i
have
finished
i
want
to
settle
this
fifth
avenue
creature
for
all
time
what
i
have
to
say
is
this
i
think
you
are
more
attractive
finer
bigger
more
rounded
in
character
and
manner
mellower
sweeter
sounder
with
all
your
angles
and
corners
rubbed
smooth
saner
better
poised
than
any
woman
i
have
ever
known
and
what
i
am
you
have
made
me
directly
and
indirectly
by
association
and
by
actual
orders
by
suggestion
and
by
direct
contact
what
you
did
for
jock
purposefully
and
by
force
you
did
for
me
too
not
so
directly
perhaps
but
with
the
same
result
emma
mcchesney
you
made
actually
made
molded
shaped
and
turned
out
two
men
you
the
greatest
sculptor
that
ever
lived
you
could
make
a
scarecrow
in
a
field
get
up
and
achieve
everywhere
one
sees
women
eager
tense
when
there
appears
one
who
has
herself
in
leash
balanced
tolerant
poised
sane
composed
she
restores
your
faith
in
things
you
lean
on
her
spiritually
i
know
i
need
you
more
than
you
need
me
emma
and
i
know
you
wo
love
me
the
less
for
that
there
that
about
all
for
this
evening
i
think
breathed
emma
mcchesney
in
a
choked
little
voice
that
that
about
enough
two
days
before
the
date
set
for
their
very
quiet
wedding
they
told
the
heads
of
office
and
workroom
office
and
workroom
somewhat
moist
as
to
eye
and
flushed
as
to
cheek
and
highly
congratulatory
proved
their
knowingness
by
promptly
presenting
to
their
employers
a
very
costly
and
unbelievably
hideous
set
of
mantel
ornaments
and
clock
calculated
to
strike
horror
to
the
heart
of
any
woman
who
has
lovingly
planned
the
furnishing
of
her
pop
henderson
after
some
preliminary
wrestling
with
collar
necktie
spectacles
and
voice
launched
forth
on
a
presentation
speech
that
threatened
to
close
down
the
works
for
the
day
emma
mcchesney
heard
it
tears
in
her
eyes
buck
gnawed
his
mustache
and
when
pop
henderson
cracked
old
voice
broke
altogether
in
the
passage
that
touched
on
his
departed
employer
old
buck
and
the
great
happiness
that
this
occasion
would
have
brought
him
emma
hand
met
young
t
a
and
rested
there
hortense
and
henry
standing
very
close
together
all
through
the
speech
had
in
this
respect
anticipated
their
employers
by
several
minutes
they
were
to
be
away
two
weeks
only
no
one
knew
just
where
except
that
some
small
part
of
the
trip
was
to
be
spent
on
a
flying
visit
to
young
jock
mcchesney
out
in
chicago
he
himself
was
to
be
married
very
soon
emma
mcchesney
had
rather
startled
her
very
by
whirling
about
at
him
with
do
you
realize
that
you
very
likely
to
be
a
some
fine
day
not
so
far
away
had
gazed
at
her
for
a
rather
shocked
moment
swallowed
hard
smiled
and
said
even
that
does
scare
me
emma
everything
had
been
planned
down
to
the
last
detail
little
apartment
had
been
subleased
and
a
very
smart
one
taken
and
furnished
almost
complete
with
annie
installed
in
the
kitchen
and
a
demure
engaged
when
we
come
back
we
come
home
buck
had
said
home
there
had
been
much
to
do
but
it
had
all
been
done
smoothly
and
expertly
under
the
direction
of
these
two
who
had
learned
how
to
plan
direct
and
carry
out
then
on
the
last
day
emma
mcchesney
visibly
perturbed
entered
her
partner
office
a
letter
in
her
hand
this
is
ghastly
she
exclaimed
buck
pulled
out
a
chair
for
her
klein
cancel
his
order
again
no
and
do
ask
me
to
sit
down
be
thankful
that
i
do
blow
up
is
it
as
bad
as
that
bad
here
read
that
no
do
read
it
i
tell
you
relieve
my
feelings
you
know
how
i
been
angling
and
scheming
and
contriving
and
plotting
for
years
to
get
an
exclusive
order
from
gage
fosdick
of
course
we
had
a
nice
little
order
every
few
months
but
what
that
from
the
biggest
house
in
the
world
and
now
out
of
a
blue
sky
comes
this
bolt
from
who
buys
our
stuff
saying
that
he
coming
on
the
tenth
that
next
week
that
planned
to
establish
our
line
with
their
trade
and
that
he
wants
us
to
be
prepared
for
a
order
i
fairly
prayed
for
this
and
now
what
shall
we
do
do
smoothly
just
write
the
gentleman
and
tell
him
you
busy
getting
married
this
week
and
next
and
that
by
a
singular
coincidence
your
partner
is
similarly
engaged
that
our
manager
will
attend
to
him
with
all
care
and
courtesy
unless
he
can
postpone
his
trip
until
our
return
suggest
that
he
call
around
a
week
or
two
later
buck
i
know
it
is
considered
good
form
to
rage
and
glare
at
one
fiance
on
the
eve
of
one
if
this
were
a
week
earlier
or
a
week
later
i
be
tempted
to
shake
you
buck
stood
up
came
over
to
her
and
laid
a
hand
very
gently
on
her
arm
with
the
other
hand
he
took
the
letter
from
her
fingers
emma
you
tired
and
a
little
excited
you
been
under
an
unusual
physical
and
mental
strain
for
the
last
few
weeks
give
me
that
letter
i
answer
it
this
kind
of
thing
he
held
up
the
letter
has
meant
everything
to
you
if
it
had
not
where
would
i
be
but
emma
it
does
mean
a
thing
not
one
thing
slowly
emma
mcchesney
tense
body
relaxed
a
great
sigh
that
had
in
it
weariness
and
relief
and
acquiescence
came
from
her
she
smiled
ever
so
faintly
i
been
a
ramrod
so
long
it
going
to
be
hard
to
learn
to
be
a
clinging
vine
i
been
my
own
support
for
so
many
years
i
do
use
a
trellis
very
gracefully
yet
but
i
think
i
get
the
hang
of
it
very
soon
she
turned
toward
the
door
crossed
to
her
own
office
looked
all
about
at
the
orderly
room
that
reflected
her
personality
as
did
any
room
she
occupied
just
the
same
she
called
out
over
her
shoulder
to
buck
in
the
doorway
i
hate
like
fury
to
see
that
order
slide
in
hat
and
coat
and
furs
she
stood
a
moment
her
fingers
on
the
electric
switch
her
eyes
very
bright
and
wide
the
memories
of
ten
years
fifteen
years
twenty
years
crowded
up
around
her
and
filled
the
little
room
some
of
them
were
golden
and
some
of
them
were
black
a
few
had
power
to
frighten
her
even
now
so
she
turned
out
the
light
stood
for
just
another
moment
there
in
the
darkness
then
stepped
out
into
the
hall
closed
the
door
softly
behind
her
and
stood
face
to
face
with
the
lettering
on
the
glass
panel
of
the
door
the
lettering
that
spelled
the
name
mrs
mcchesney
buck
watched
her
in
silence
she
reached
up
with
one
wavering
forefinger
and
touched
each
of
the
twelve
letters
one
after
the
other
then
she
spread
her
hand
wide
blotting
out
the
second
word
and
when
she
turned
away
one
saw
she
being
emma
mcchesney
and
a
woman
and
very
tired
and
rather
sentimental
and
a
bit
hysterical
and
altogether
happy
that
though
she
was
smiling
her
eyes
were
wet
in
her
ten
years
on
the
road
visiting
town
after
town
catching
trains
jolting
about
in
rumbling
hotel
or
hacks
living
in
hotels
good
bad
and
indifferent
emma
mcchesney
had
come
upon
hundreds
of
bridal
couples
she
had
leaned
from
her
window
at
many
a
railway
station
to
see
the
barbaric
and
cruel
old
custom
of
baiting
she
had
smiled
very
tenderly
and
rather
sadly
and
hopefully
too
upon
the
boy
and
girl
who
rushed
breathless
into
the
car
in
a
flurry
of
white
streamers
flowers
old
shoes
laughter
cheers
last
messages
now
as
in
a
dream
she
found
herself
actually
of
these
of
rice
old
shoes
and
badinage
there
had
been
none
it
is
true
she
stood
quietly
by
while
buck
attended
to
their
trunks
just
as
she
had
seen
it
done
by
hundreds
of
helpless
little
women
who
had
never
checked
a
trunk
in
their
lives
she
who
had
spent
ten
years
of
her
life
wrestling
with
trunks
and
baggagemen
and
porters
once
there
was
some
trifling
mistake
buck
fault
emma
with
her
experience
of
the
road
saw
his
error
she
could
have
set
him
right
with
a
word
it
was
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
by
sheer
force
of
will
she
withheld
that
word
fought
back
the
almost
overwhelming
inclination
to
take
things
in
hand
set
them
right
it
was
just
an
incident
almost
trifling
in
itself
but
its
import
was
tremendous
for
her
conduct
that
moment
shaped
the
happiness
of
their
future
life
together
emma
had
said
that
there
would
be
no
rude
awakenings
for
them
no
startling
shocks
there
is
a
thing
we
do
know
about
each
other
she
had
said
we
each
know
the
other
weaknesses
and
strength
i
hate
the
way
you
gnaw
your
mustache
when
you
troubled
and
i
think
the
fuss
you
make
when
the
waiter
pours
your
coffee
without
first
having
given
you
sugar
and
cream
is
the
most
absurd
thing
i
ever
seen
but
then
i
know
how
it
annoys
you
to
see
me
sitting
with
one
slipper
dangling
from
my
toe
when
i
particularly
comfortable
and
snug
you
know
how
i
like
my
eggs
and
you
think
it
immoral
i
suppose
we
really
set
in
our
ways
it
going
to
be
interesting
to
watch
each
other
shift
just
the
same
buck
said
i
did
dream
there
was
any
woman
living
who
could
actually
make
a
pullman
look
homelike
any
woman
who
has
spent
a
fourth
of
her
life
in
hotels
and
trains
learns
that
trick
she
has
to
if
she
happens
to
be
the
sort
that
likes
books
and
flowers
and
sewing
she
carries
some
of
each
with
her
and
one
book
one
rose
and
one
piece
of
unfinished
embroidery
would
make
an
oasis
in
the
sahara
desert
look
homelike
it
was
on
the
westbound
train
that
they
encountered
sam
sam
of
the
rolling
eye
the
genial
grin
the
deft
hand
sam
was
known
to
every
hardened
traveler
as
the
porter
de
luxe
of
the
road
sam
was
a
diplomat
a
financier
and
a
rascal
he
never
forgot
a
face
he
never
forgave
a
meager
tip
the
passengers
who
traveled
with
him
were
at
once
his
guests
and
his
victims
therefore
his
good
evenin
mis
mcchesney
good
even
well
it
has
been
a
long
time
sense
ah
had
the
pleasuh
of
yoh
presence
as
passengah
ah
sure
am
the
slim
elegant
figure
of
buck
appeared
in
the
doorway
rolling
eye
became
a
thing
on
ball
bearings
his
teeth
flashed
startlingly
white
in
the
broadest
of
grins
he
took
buck
hat
ran
a
finger
under
its
inner
band
and
shook
it
very
gently
what
the
idea
inquired
buck
genially
are
you
a
combination
porter
and
prestidigitator
sam
chuckled
his
infectious
negro
chuckle
well
no
sah
ah
wouldn
go
fah
as
t
say
that
sah
but
ah
hab
been
known
to
shake
rice
out
of
a
ordinary
black
derby
hat
get
out
laughed
buck
as
sam
ducked
you
may
as
well
get
used
to
it
smiled
emma
because
i
known
to
every
porter
and
between
here
and
the
great
lakes
it
was
sam
who
proved
himself
hero
of
the
honeymoon
for
he
saved
buck
from
continuing
his
journey
to
chicago
brideless
fifteen
minutes
earlier
buck
had
gone
to
the
for
a
smoke
at
cleveland
emma
looking
out
of
the
car
window
saw
a
familiar
figure
pacing
up
and
down
the
station
platform
it
was
that
dapper
and
important
little
irishman
buyer
for
gage
fosdick
the
greatest
house
in
the
world
whose
letter
buck
had
answered
whose
order
meant
thousands
he
was
on
his
way
to
new
york
of
course
in
that
moment
buck
faded
into
the
background
and
emma
mcchesney
rose
up
in
her
place
she
snatched
hat
and
coat
and
furs
put
them
on
as
she
went
down
the
long
aisle
swung
down
the
car
steps
and
flew
down
the
platform
to
the
unconscious
he
was
smoking
all
unconscious
the
fates
had
delivered
him
into
her
expert
hands
she
knew
those
kindly
sisters
of
old
and
she
was
the
last
to
refuse
their
largesse
mr
he
wheeled
mrs
mcchesney
he
had
just
a
charming
trace
of
a
brogue
his
enemies
said
he
assumed
it
well
who
was
i
thinkin
of
but
you
a
minute
ago
what
i
on
my
way
to
chicago
saw
you
from
the
car
window
you
on
the
new
york
train
i
thought
so
tell
me
you
surely
seeing
our
man
are
you
smiling
face
clouded
he
was
a
temperamental
irishman
ted
with
ideas
on
the
deference
due
him
and
his
great
house
i
tell
you
the
truth
mcchesney
i
had
a
letter
from
your
buck
it
was
much
of
a
letter
to
a
man
like
me
representing
a
house
like
gage
fosdick
it
said
both
heads
of
the
firm
would
be
out
of
town
and
would
i
see
the
manager
me
see
the
manager
well
thinks
i
if
that
how
important
they
think
my
order
then
they
not
get
it
that
all
i
never
yet
dear
please
do
be
offended
as
a
mcchesney
to
an
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
just
been
married
married
god
bless
me
to
to
buck
of
course
he
on
that
train
he
she
turned
toward
the
train
and
as
she
turned
it
began
to
move
ever
so
gently
at
the
same
moment
there
sped
toward
her
with
unbelievable
swiftness
the
figure
of
sam
the
porter
his
eyes
all
whites
by
one
arm
he
grasped
her
and
half
carried
half
jerked
her
to
the
steps
of
the
moving
train
swung
her
up
to
the
steps
like
a
bundle
of
rags
caught
the
rail
by
a
miracle
and
stood
grinning
and
triumphant
gazing
down
at
the
panting
who
was
running
alongside
the
train
back
in
a
week
will
you
wait
for
us
in
new
york
called
emma
her
breath
coming
fast
she
was
trembling
too
and
laughing
will
i
wait
called
back
the
puffing
every
bit
of
the
irish
in
him
beaming
from
his
eyes
i
be
there
when
you
get
back
as
sure
as
your
name
mcbuck
from
his
pocket
he
took
a
round
silver
western
dollar
and
still
running
tossed
it
to
the
toothy
sam
that
peerless
porter
caught
it
twirled
it
kissed
it
bowed
and
grinned
afresh
as
the
train
glided
out
of
the
shed
emma
flushed
smiling
flew
up
the
aisle
buck
listening
to
her
laughing
triumphant
account
of
her
hairbreadth
adventure
frowned
before
he
smiled
emma
how
could
you
do
it
at
least
why
did
you
send
back
for
me
first
emma
smiled
a
little
tremulously
do
be
angry
you
see
dear
boy
i
only
been
your
wife
for
a
week
but
i
been
featherloom
petticoats
for
over
fifteen
years
it
a
habit
just
how
strong
and
fixed
a
habit
she
proved
to
herself
a
little
more
than
a
week
later
it
was
the
morning
of
their
first
breakfast
in
the
new
apartment
you
would
have
thought
to
see
them
over
their
coffee
and
eggs
and
rolls
that
they
had
been
breakfasting
together
thus
for
years
annie
was
so
at
home
in
her
new
kitchen
the
deft
little
maid
in
her
crisp
white
fitted
so
perfectly
into
the
picture
perhaps
the
thing
that
buck
said
once
the
maid
left
them
alone
might
have
given
an
outsider
the
cue
you
remind
me
of
a
sweetpea
emma
one
of
those
crisp
erect
fresh
fragrant
sweetpeas
i
think
it
is
the
slenderest
sweetest
neatest
trimmest
flower
in
the
world
so
delicately
set
on
its
stem
and
yet
so
straight
so
independent
you
say
such
dear
things
to
me
no
they
had
not
been
breakfasting
together
for
years
i
glad
you
not
one
of
those
women
that
wears
a
frowsy
lacy
ribbony
down
to
breakfast
they
always
make
me
think
of
uncombed
hair
that
just
one
reason
why
glad
and
i
glad
said
emma
looking
at
his
clear
eyes
and
steady
hand
and
firm
skin
for
a
number
of
reasons
one
of
them
is
that
not
the
sort
of
man
who
a
grouch
at
breakfast
when
he
had
hat
and
coat
and
stick
in
hand
and
had
kissed
her
and
reached
the
door
and
opened
it
he
came
back
again
as
is
the
way
of
bridegrooms
but
at
last
the
door
closed
behind
him
emma
sat
there
a
moment
listening
to
his
quick
light
step
down
the
corridor
to
the
opening
of
the
lift
door
to
its
metallic
closing
she
sat
there
in
the
sunshiny
in
her
fresh
white
morning
gown
she
picked
up
her
newspaper
opened
it
scanned
it
put
it
down
for
years
now
she
had
read
her
newspaper
in
little
gulps
on
the
way
downtown
in
crowded
subway
or
she
could
not
accustom
herself
to
this
leisurely
scanning
of
the
pages
she
rose
went
to
the
window
came
back
to
the
table
stood
there
a
moment
her
eyes
fixed
on
something
far
away
the
swinging
door
between
and
butler
pantry
opened
annie
in
her
neat
stripes
stood
before
her
shall
it
be
steak
or
chops
mrs
mc
buck
emma
turned
her
head
in
annie
direction
then
her
eyes
the
two
actions
were
distinct
and
separate
steak
or
there
was
a
little
bewildered
look
in
her
eyes
her
mind
had
not
yet
focused
on
the
question
steak
oh
oh
yes
of
course
why
why
annie
and
the
splendid
mind
brought
itself
down
to
the
settling
of
this
question
why
annie
considering
all
things
i
think
we
make
it
filet
with
mushrooms
iv
blue
serge
for
ten
years
emma
mcchesney
home
had
been
a
she
had
taken
her
family
life
at
second
hand
four
nights
out
of
the
seven
her
bed
was
lower
eight
and
her
breakfast
as
many
mornings
a
lukewarm
horror
taken
with
a
stranger
and
presided
over
by
a
bandit
to
whom
a
saucer
was
a
matter
of
course
it
had
been
her
habit
during
those
ten
years
on
the
road
as
traveling
saleswoman
for
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
to
avoid
the
discomfort
of
the
rapidly
chilling
car
by
slipping
early
into
her
berth
there
in
kimono
if
not
in
comfort
she
would
shut
down
the
electric
light
with
a
snap
raise
the
shade
and
propped
up
on
one
elbow
watch
the
little
towns
go
by
they
had
a
wonderful
fascination
for
her
those
middle
western
towns
whose
very
names
had
a
comfortable
sound
sandusky
galesburg
crawfordsville
appleton
very
real
towns
with
very
real
people
in
them
peering
wistfully
out
through
the
dusk
she
could
get
little
intimate
glimpses
of
the
home
life
of
these
people
as
the
night
came
on
in
those
modest
frame
houses
near
the
station
they
need
not
trouble
to
pull
down
the
shades
as
must
their
cautious
city
cousins
as
the
train
slowed
down
there
could
be
had
a
glimpse
of
a
matronly
housewife
moving
deftly
about
in
the
kitchen
glow
a
man
reading
a
paper
in
slippered
comfort
a
girl
at
the
piano
a
woman
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
or
a
family
group
perhaps
seated
about
the
table
deep
in
an
conclave
it
had
made
her
homeless
as
she
was
homesick
emma
always
liked
that
picture
best
her
keen
imaginative
mind
could
sense
the
scene
could
actually
follow
the
trend
of
the
talk
during
this
the
most
genial
homely
hour
of
the
day
the
trifling
events
of
the
last
twelve
hours
in
schoolroom
in
store
in
office
in
street
in
kitchen
loom
up
large
as
they
are
rehearsed
in
that
magic
animated
cozy
moment
just
before
ma
says
with
a
sigh
well
folks
go
on
into
the
me
and
nellie
got
to
clear
away
just
silhouettes
as
the
train
flashed
by
these
people
but
very
human
very
enviable
to
emma
mcchesney
they
real
she
would
say
they
regular
people
i
been
peeking
in
at
their
windows
for
ten
years
and
learned
that
it
is
in
these
towns
that
folks
really
live
the
difference
between
life
here
and
life
in
new
york
is
the
difference
between
area
and
depth
see
what
i
mean
in
new
york
they
live
by
the
mile
and
here
they
live
by
the
cubic
foot
well
i
rather
have
one
juicy
thick
than
a
whole
platterful
of
it
the
same
idea
to
those
of
her
business
colleagues
whose
habit
it
was
to
lounge
in
the
hotel
window
with
sneering
comment
upon
the
procession
as
it
went
by
emma
mcchesney
had
been
wont
to
say
do
sneer
at
main
street
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
is
it
true
that
fifth
avenue
any
bright
winter
afternoon
between
four
and
six
is
only
main
street
on
a
busy
day
multiplied
by
one
thousand
emma
mcchesney
was
not
the
sort
of
woman
to
rail
at
a
fate
that
had
placed
her
in
the
harness
instead
of
in
the
carriage
but
during
all
the
long
years
of
pull
from
the
time
she
started
with
a
humble
salary
in
the
office
of
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
through
the
years
spent
on
the
road
up
to
the
very
time
when
the
crown
of
success
came
to
her
in
the
form
of
the
secretaryship
of
the
prosperous
firm
of
buck
there
was
a
minor
but
fixed
ambition
in
her
heart
that
same
ambition
is
to
be
found
deep
down
in
the
heart
of
every
woman
whose
morning
costume
is
a
tailor
suit
whose
newspaper
must
be
read
in
hurried
snatches
on
the
way
downtown
in
crowded
train
or
car
and
to
whom
nine
spells
business
in
fifteen
years
emma
mcchesney
used
to
say
i
never
known
what
it
is
to
loll
in
leisure
i
never
had
a
chance
to
luxuriate
sunday
to
a
working
woman
sunday
is
for
the
purpose
of
repairing
the
ravages
of
the
other
six
days
by
the
time
you
washed
your
brushes
mended
your
darned
your
stockings
and
gloves
looked
for
gray
hairs
and
and
skimmed
the
magazine
section
monday
it
was
small
wonder
that
emma
mcchesney
leisure
had
been
limited
in
those
busy
years
she
had
not
only
earned
the
living
for
herself
and
her
boy
she
had
trained
that
boy
into
manhood
and
placed
his
foot
on
the
first
rung
of
business
success
she
had
transformed
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
from
a
placidly
mediocre
concern
to
a
thriving
flourishing
nationally
known
institution
all
this
might
have
turned
another
woman
head
it
only
served
to
set
emma
mcchesney
more
splendidly
on
her
shoulders
not
too
splendidly
however
for
with
her
marriage
to
her
handsome
business
partner
buck
that
independent
head
was
found
to
fit
very
cozily
into
the
comfortable
hollow
formed
by
buck
right
arm
emma
buck
had
said
just
before
their
marriage
what
is
the
arrangement
to
be
after
after
just
what
it
is
now
i
suppose
emma
had
replied
except
that
come
down
to
the
office
together
he
had
regarded
her
thoughtfully
for
a
long
minute
then
emma
for
three
months
after
our
marriage
will
you
try
being
just
a
buck
you
mean
no
factory
no
featherlooms
no
dictation
no
business
bothers
her
voice
was
a
rising
scale
of
surprise
just
try
it
for
three
months
with
the
privilege
of
a
lifetime
if
you
like
it
but
try
it
i
i
like
to
see
you
there
when
i
leave
emma
i
like
to
have
you
there
when
i
come
home
i
suppose
i
sound
like
a
selfish
turk
but
you
sound
like
a
regular
husband
emma
mcchesney
had
interrupted
and
i
love
you
for
it
now
listen
a
for
three
whole
months
going
to
be
what
the
yellow
novels
used
to
call
a
i
going
to
meet
you
at
the
door
every
night
with
a
rose
in
my
hair
i
shall
wear
pink
things
with
lace
ruffles
on
do
you
know
that
been
longing
to
do
just
those
things
for
years
and
years
i
going
to
blossom
out
into
a
beauty
watch
me
i
never
had
time
to
study
myself
i
hold
shades
of
yellow
and
green
and
up
to
my
face
to
see
which
brings
out
the
right
tints
i
going
to
gaze
at
myself
through
eyes
to
see
which
shade
produces
tawny
lights
in
my
hair
ever
since
i
can
remember
i
been
so
busy
that
it
has
been
a
question
of
getting
the
best
possible
garments
in
the
least
possible
time
for
the
smallest
possible
sum
in
that
case
one
gets
blue
serge
i
worn
blue
serge
until
it
feels
like
a
uniform
i
going
to
blossom
out
into
fawn
and
green
and
mauve
i
shall
get
evening
dresses
with
only
bead
i
going
to
shop
i
never
really
seen
fifth
avenue
between
eleven
and
one
when
the
real
people
come
out
my
views
of
it
have
been
at
nine
when
the
are
going
to
work
and
at
when
they
are
going
home
i
will
now
cease
to
observe
the
proletariat
and
mingle
with
the
predatory
i
probably
go
in
for
those
tiffin
things
at
the
plaza
if
i
do
i
never
be
the
same
woman
again
whereupon
she
paused
with
dramatic
effect
to
all
of
which
buck
had
replied
go
as
far
as
you
like
take
fencing
lessons
if
you
want
to
or
sanskrit
you
been
a
queen
bee
for
so
many
years
that
i
think
the
role
of
drone
will
be
a
pleasant
change
let
me
shoulder
the
business
worries
for
a
while
you
borne
them
long
enough
it
a
bargain
for
three
months
i
shall
do
nothing
more
militant
than
to
pick
imaginary
threads
off
your
coat
lapel
and
pout
when
you
mention
business
at
the
end
of
those
three
months
we
go
into
private
session
compare
notes
and
determine
whether
the
plan
shall
cease
or
become
permanent
shake
hands
on
it
they
shook
hands
solemnly
as
they
did
so
a
faint
shadow
of
doubt
hovered
far
far
back
in
the
depths
of
buck
fine
eyes
and
a
faint
inscrutable
smile
lurked
in
the
corners
of
emma
lips
so
it
was
that
emma
mcchesney
the
alert
the
capable
the
brisk
the
assumed
the
role
of
buck
the
leisurely
the
languid
the
elegant
she
who
formerly
at
eleven
in
the
morning
might
have
been
seen
bent
on
selling
the
best
possible
bill
of
spring
featherlooms
to
joe
greenbaum
of
keokuk
iowa
could
now
be
found
in
a
modiste
salon
being
draped
and
pinned
and
fitted
she
whose
dynamic
force
once
charged
the
entire
office
and
factory
with
energy
and
efficiency
now
distributed
a
tithe
of
that
priceless
vigor
here
a
tithe
there
a
tithe
everywhere
and
thus
broke
the
very
backbone
of
its
power
she
had
never
been
a
woman
to
do
things
by
halves
what
she
undertook
to
do
she
did
thoroughly
and
this
principle
she
applied
to
her
new
mode
of
life
as
rigidly
as
she
had
to
the
old
that
first
month
slipped
magically
by
emma
was
too
much
a
woman
not
to
feel
a
certain
exquisite
pleasure
in
the
selecting
of
delicate
and
becoming
fabrics
there
was
a
thrill
of
novelty
in
being
able
to
spend
an
hour
curled
up
with
a
book
after
lunch
to
listen
to
music
one
afternoon
a
week
to
drive
through
the
mistily
gray
park
to
walk
up
the
thronged
sparkling
avenue
pausing
before
its
aladdin
cave
windows
simple
enough
pleasures
and
taken
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
by
thousands
of
other
women
who
had
no
life
behind
them
to
use
as
contrast
she
plunged
into
her
new
life
the
first
new
gown
was
exciting
it
was
a
velvet
affair
with
furs
and
gratifyingly
becoming
her
shining
blond
head
rose
above
the
soft
background
of
velvet
and
fur
with
an
effect
to
distract
the
least
observing
like
it
she
had
asked
buck
turning
slowly
frankly
sure
of
herself
you
wonderful
in
it
said
buck
say
emma
where
that
blue
thing
you
used
to
wear
the
one
with
the
white
cuffs
and
collar
and
the
little
blue
hat
with
the
on
it
buck
you
you
well
you
a
man
that
what
you
are
that
blue
thing
was
worn
threadbare
in
the
office
and
i
gave
it
to
the
laundress
niece
weeks
ago
small
wonder
her
cheeks
took
on
a
deeper
pink
oh
said
buck
unruffled
too
bad
there
was
something
about
that
dress
i
do
know
at
the
first
sitting
of
the
second
gown
emma
revolted
openly
on
the
floor
at
emma
feet
there
was
knotted
into
a
contortionistic
attitude
a
small
wiry
impolite
person
named
smalley
miss
smalley
was
an
artist
in
draping
and
knew
it
she
was
the
least
fashionable
person
in
all
that
smart
dressmaking
establishment
she
refused
to
notice
the
edict
that
governed
all
other
employees
in
the
shop
in
her
shabby
little
dress
her
spectacles
her
apron
smalley
might
have
passed
for
a
bird
center
home
dressmaker
yet
given
a
yard
or
two
or
three
of
satin
and
a
saucer
of
pins
smalley
could
make
the
dumpiest
of
debutantes
look
like
a
fragile
flower
at
a
critical
moment
emma
stirred
handicapped
as
she
was
by
a
mouthful
of
nineteen
pins
and
her
attitude
smalley
still
could
voice
a
protest
do
move
she
commanded
thickly
wait
a
minute
emma
said
and
moved
again
more
disastrously
than
before
do
you
think
it
too
too
young
she
eyed
herself
in
the
mirror
anxiously
then
looked
down
at
miss
smalley
face
that
was
peering
up
at
her
its
lips
pursed
grotesquely
over
the
pins
of
course
it
is
mumbled
miss
smalley
everybody
clothes
are
too
young
for
nowadays
the
only
difference
between
the
dresses
we
make
for
girls
of
sixteen
and
the
dresses
we
make
for
their
grandmothers
of
sixty
is
that
the
ones
want
shorter
and
lower
and
they
run
more
to
trimming
emma
surveyed
the
acid
miss
smalley
with
a
look
that
was
half
amused
half
vexed
wholly
determined
i
sha
wear
it
heaven
knows
i
not
sixty
but
i
not
sixteen
either
i
do
want
to
be
miss
smalley
doubling
again
to
her
task
flung
upward
a
grudging
compliment
well
anyway
you
got
the
hair
and
the
coloring
and
the
figure
for
it
goodness
knows
you
look
young
enough
that
because
i
worked
hard
all
my
life
retorted
emma
almost
viciously
another
month
of
this
leisure
and
i
be
as
wrinkled
as
the
rest
of
them
smalley
magic
fingers
paused
in
their
manipulation
of
a
soft
fold
of
satin
worked
earned
a
living
used
your
wits
and
brains
every
day
against
the
wits
and
brains
of
other
folks
every
day
into
the
eyes
of
miss
smalley
the
artist
in
draping
there
crept
the
shrewd
twinkle
of
miss
smalley
the
successful
woman
in
business
she
had
been
sitting
back
on
her
knees
surveying
her
handiwork
through
narrowed
lids
now
she
turned
her
gaze
on
emma
who
was
smiling
down
at
her
then
for
goodness
sake
do
stop
i
found
out
that
work
is
a
kind
of
if
you
used
to
it
the
minute
you
stop
you
begin
to
get
rusty
and
your
hinges
creak
and
you
clog
up
and
the
next
thing
you
know
you
break
down
work
that
you
like
to
do
is
a
blessing
it
keeps
you
young
when
my
mother
was
my
age
she
was
crippled
with
rheumatism
and
all
gnarled
up
and
quavery
and
all
she
had
to
look
forward
to
was
death
now
me
every
time
the
styles
in
skirts
change
i
get
a
new
hold
on
life
and
on
a
day
when
i
can
make
a
short
fat
woman
look
like
a
tall
thin
woman
just
by
sitting
here
on
my
knees
with
a
handful
of
pins
and
giving
her
the
line
she
needs
i
go
home
feeling
like
i
just
been
born
i
know
that
feeling
said
emma
in
her
eyes
a
sparkle
that
had
long
been
absent
i
had
it
when
i
landed
a
featherloom
order
from
a
man
who
has
assured
me
that
he
interested
in
our
line
at
dinner
that
evening
emma
gown
was
so
obviously
not
of
the
new
crop
that
even
her
husband
inexpert
eye
noted
it
that
not
one
of
the
new
ones
is
it
this
and
you
a
manufacturer
of
skirts
what
the
matter
with
the
supply
of
new
dresses
is
there
enough
to
go
round
enough
i
never
had
so
many
new
gowns
in
my
life
the
trouble
is
that
i
sha
feel
at
home
in
them
until
i
had
all
at
least
once
during
the
second
month
there
came
a
sudden
sharp
change
in
skirt
modes
for
four
years
women
had
been
mincing
along
in
garments
so
absurdly
narrow
that
each
step
was
a
thing
to
be
considered
each
curbing
or
demanding
careful
negotiation
now
fashion
in
her
freakiest
mood
commanded
a
bewildering
width
of
skirt
that
was
just
one
remove
from
the
flaring
hoops
of
civil
war
days
emma
knew
what
that
meant
for
the
featherloom
workrooms
and
selling
staff
new
designs
new
models
a
shift
in
prices
a
boom
for
petticoats
for
four
years
a
garment
despised
a
hundred
questions
were
on
the
tip
of
emma
tongue
a
hundred
suggestions
flashed
into
her
keen
mind
there
occurred
to
her
a
wonderful
design
for
a
new
model
which
should
be
full
and
flaring
without
being
bulky
and
uncomfortable
as
were
the
wide
petticoats
of
the
old
days
but
a
bargain
was
a
bargain
still
emma
buck
was
as
human
as
emma
mcchesney
had
been
she
could
not
resist
a
timid
are
you
that
is
i
was
just
wondering
you
making
wide
i
suppose
for
the
spring
trade
a
queer
look
flashed
into
buck
eyes
a
relieved
look
that
was
as
quickly
replaced
by
an
expression
both
baffled
and
anxious
why
a
mmmm
yes
oh
yes
we
making
up
wide
but
but
what
emma
leaned
forward
tense
oh
nothing
nothing
during
the
second
month
there
came
calling
on
emma
those
solid
and
heavy
new
yorkers
with
whom
the
buck
family
had
been
on
friendly
terms
for
many
years
they
came
at
the
correct
hour
in
their
correct
motor
or
conservative
broughams
wearing
their
quietly
correct
clothes
and
emma
gave
them
tea
and
they
talked
on
every
subject
from
suffrage
to
salad
dressings
and
from
war
to
weather
but
never
once
was
mention
made
of
business
and
emma
mcchesney
life
had
been
interwoven
with
business
for
more
than
fifteen
years
there
were
dinners
long
heavy
correct
dinners
emma
very
well
dressed
alert
intelligent
vital
became
very
popular
at
these
affairs
and
her
husband
very
proud
of
her
popularity
and
if
any
one
as
thoroughly
alive
as
buck
could
have
been
bored
to
extinction
by
anything
then
those
dinners
would
have
accomplished
the
deadly
work
she
said
one
evening
after
a
particularly
large
affair
of
this
sort
have
you
ever
noticed
anything
about
me
that
is
different
from
other
women
have
i
well
i
should
say
i
oh
i
do
mean
what
you
mean
dear
thanks
just
the
same
i
mean
those
women
tonight
they
all
seem
to
in
for
something
votes
or
charity
or
dancing
or
social
service
or
something
even
the
girls
and
they
all
sounded
so
amateurish
so
untrained
so
unprepared
yet
they
seemed
to
be
dreadfully
in
earnest
this
is
the
difference
said
buck
you
rubbed
up
against
life
and
you
know
they
always
been
sheltered
but
now
they
want
to
know
well
naturally
they
going
to
bungle
and
bump
their
heads
a
good
many
times
before
they
really
find
out
anyway
retorted
emma
they
want
to
know
that
something
better
to
have
bumped
your
head
even
though
you
never
see
what
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
than
never
to
have
tried
to
climb
it
it
was
in
the
third
week
of
the
third
month
that
emma
encountered
hortense
hortense
before
her
marriage
to
henry
the
had
been
a
very
pretty
very
pert
very
devoted
little
stenographer
in
the
office
of
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
she
had
married
just
a
month
after
her
employers
and
emma
from
the
fulness
of
her
own
brimming
cup
of
happiness
had
made
hortense
happy
with
a
gift
of
linens
and
lingerie
and
lace
of
a
fineness
that
feminine
heart
could
never
have
hoped
for
they
met
in
the
busy
aisle
of
a
downtown
department
store
and
shook
hands
as
do
those
who
have
a
common
bond
hortense
as
pretty
as
ever
and
as
pert
spoke
first
i
would
have
known
you
mc
buck
no
why
not
you
look
no
one
would
think
you
ever
worked
in
your
life
i
was
down
at
the
office
the
other
day
for
a
minute
the
first
time
since
i
was
married
they
told
me
you
were
there
any
more
no
i
have
been
down
since
my
marriage
either
i
like
you
an
elegant
lady
of
leisure
hortense
eyes
dwelt
searchingly
on
the
face
of
her
former
employer
the
bunch
in
the
office
said
they
missed
you
something
awful
then
in
haste
oh
i
do
mean
that
buck
do
make
things
go
all
right
they
awful
fond
of
him
but
i
do
know
miss
kelly
said
she
never
has
got
over
waiting
for
the
sound
of
your
step
down
the
hall
at
nine
sort
of
light
and
quick
and
sharp
and
busy
as
if
you
wait
till
you
waded
into
the
day
work
do
you
know
what
i
mean
i
know
what
you
mean
said
emma
there
was
a
little
pause
the
two
women
so
far
apart
yet
so
near
so
different
yet
so
like
gazed
far
down
into
each
other
soul
miss
it
do
you
said
hortense
yes
do
you
do
i
say
she
turned
and
indicated
the
women
surging
up
and
down
the
store
aisles
and
her
glance
and
gesture
were
replete
with
contempt
say
look
at
wandering
around
here
aimless
as
a
lot
of
chickens
in
a
barnyard
half
of
are
here
because
they
got
anything
else
to
do
think
of
it
i
watched
lots
of
times
they
go
pawing
over
silks
and
laces
and
trimmings
just
for
the
pleasure
of
feeling
they
stand
in
front
of
a
glass
case
with
a
figure
in
it
all
dressed
up
in
satin
and
furs
and
jewels
and
you
think
they
were
worshiping
an
idol
like
they
used
to
in
the
olden
days
they
do
seem
to
have
anything
to
do
nothing
to
occupy
their
their
heads
say
if
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
like
them
in
time
i
hortense
my
dear
child
you
you
happy
are
you
henry
well
i
should
say
we
are
i
crazy
about
henry
and
he
thinks
perfect
honestly
ai
they
a
scream
they
think
they
so
big
and
manly
and
all
and
they
just
like
kids
ai
it
so
we
living
in
a
apartment
in
harlem
we
got
it
fixed
up
too
cozy
for
anything
i
like
to
come
and
see
you
said
emma
hortense
opened
her
eyes
wide
honestly
if
you
would
let
go
up
now
i
the
car
outside
now
why
i
i
love
it
they
chattered
like
schoolgirls
on
the
way
uptown
these
two
who
had
found
so
much
in
common
the
little
apartment
reached
hortense
threw
open
the
door
with
the
confident
gesture
of
the
housekeeper
who
is
not
afraid
to
have
her
household
taken
by
surprise
whose
housekeeping
is
an
index
of
character
hortense
had
been
a
little
stenographer
her
correspondence
had
always
been
free
from
erasures
errors
her
flat
was
as
spotless
as
her
typewritten
letters
had
been
the
kitchen
shone
in
its
blue
and
white
and
nickel
a
canary
chirped
in
the
tiny
there
were
books
and
magazines
on
the
table
the
bedroom
was
brave
in
its
snowy
spread
and
the
toilet
silver
that
had
been
henry
gift
to
her
the
christmas
they
became
engaged
emma
examined
everything
exclaimed
over
everything
admired
everything
hortense
glowed
like
a
rose
do
you
really
like
it
i
like
the
green
velours
in
the
do
you
it
always
so
kind
and
cheerful
we
not
all
settled
yet
i
do
suppose
we
ever
will
be
sundays
henry
putters
around
putting
up
shelves
and
fooling
around
with
a
can
of
paint
i
always
tell
him
he
ought
to
have
lived
on
a
farm
where
he
have
no
wonder
you
so
happy
and
busy
emma
exclaimed
and
patted
the
girl
fresh
young
cheek
hortense
was
silent
a
moment
i
happy
she
said
at
last
but
i
ai
busy
and
well
if
you
not
busy
you
ca
be
happy
very
long
can
you
no
said
emma
idleness
when
you
not
used
to
it
is
misery
there
you
said
it
it
like
running
on
when
used
to
a
shift
something
lacking
it
is
that
henry
is
grand
to
me
because
he
is
evenings
we
so
happy
that
we
just
sit
and
grin
at
each
other
and
half
the
time
we
forget
to
go
to
a
after
henry
leaves
in
the
morning
i
get
to
work
i
suppose
in
the
old
days
when
women
used
to
have
to
chop
the
kindling
and
catch
the
water
for
washing
in
a
and
keep
up
a
fire
in
the
kitchen
stove
and
do
their
own
bread
baking
and
all
it
used
to
keep
hustling
but
my
goodness
a
flat
for
two
any
work
by
eleven
i
through
i
straightened
everything
from
the
bed
to
the
refrigerator
the
marketing
done
and
the
dinner
vegetables
are
sitting
around
in
cold
water
the
mending
for
two
is
a
joke
henry
says
it
a
wonder
i
do
sew
buttons
on
his
undershirts
emma
was
not
smiling
but
then
neither
was
hortense
she
was
talking
lightly
seemingly
but
her
pretty
face
was
quite
serious
the
big
noise
in
my
day
is
when
henry
comes
home
at
six
that
was
all
right
and
natural
i
suppose
in
those
times
when
a
was
a
wild
afternoon
work
and
teaching
school
was
the
most
advanced
job
a
woman
could
hold
down
emma
was
gazing
fascinated
at
the
girl
sparkling
face
her
own
eyes
were
very
bright
and
her
lips
were
parted
tell
me
hortense
she
said
now
what
does
henry
say
to
all
this
have
you
told
him
how
you
feel
well
i
i
talked
to
him
about
it
once
or
twice
i
told
him
that
got
about
solid
hours
a
week
that
i
might
be
getting
fifty
cents
an
hour
for
you
know
i
worked
for
a
concern
before
i
came
over
to
buck
plays
and
stories
and
that
kind
of
thing
they
used
to
like
my
work
because
i
never
queered
their
speeches
by
leaving
out
punctuation
or
mixing
up
the
characters
the
manager
there
said
i
could
have
work
any
time
i
wanted
it
i
got
my
own
typewriter
i
got
it
second
hand
when
i
first
started
in
henry
picks
around
on
it
sometimes
evenings
i
hardly
ever
touch
it
getting
rusty
and
so
am
i
it
is
just
the
money
you
want
hortense
are
you
sure
of
course
i
like
the
money
that
extra
coming
in
would
mean
books
i
crazy
about
reading
and
so
is
henry
and
theaters
and
lots
of
things
we
ca
afford
now
but
that
is
all
henry
do
want
to
be
a
all
his
life
he
crazy
about
mechanics
and
that
kind
of
stuff
but
the
books
that
he
needs
cost
a
lot
do
you
suppose
i
be
proud
to
feel
that
the
extra
money
i
earned
would
lift
him
up
where
he
could
have
a
chance
to
be
something
but
henry
is
dead
set
against
it
he
says
he
is
the
one
that
going
to
earn
the
money
around
here
i
try
to
tell
him
that
i
used
to
using
my
mind
he
laughs
and
pinches
my
cheek
and
tells
me
to
use
it
thinking
about
him
she
stopped
suddenly
and
regarded
emma
with
eyes
you
do
think
i
running
down
henry
do
you
my
goodness
i
want
you
to
think
that
i
change
back
again
for
a
million
dollars
because
i
would
she
looked
up
at
emma
emma
came
swiftly
over
and
put
one
hand
on
the
girl
shoulder
i
do
think
it
not
for
a
minute
i
know
that
the
world
is
full
of
henrys
and
that
the
number
of
hortenses
is
growing
larger
and
larger
i
do
know
if
the
flats
are
to
blame
or
whether
it
just
a
natural
development
but
the
situation
seems
to
be
spreading
to
the
apartments
too
hortense
nodded
a
knowing
head
i
kind
of
thought
so
from
the
way
you
were
listening
the
two
standing
there
gazing
at
each
other
almost
shyly
suddenly
began
to
laugh
the
laugh
was
a
then
quite
as
suddenly
both
became
serious
that
seriousness
had
been
the
throughout
i
wonder
said
emma
very
gently
if
a
small
henry
some
day
provide
you
with
an
outlet
for
all
that
energy
hortense
looked
up
very
bravely
maybe
you
you
must
have
been
about
my
age
when
your
boy
was
born
did
he
make
you
feel
different
the
shade
of
sadness
that
always
came
at
the
mention
of
those
unhappy
years
of
her
early
marriage
crept
into
emma
face
now
that
was
not
the
same
dear
she
explained
i
had
your
sort
of
henry
you
see
my
boy
was
my
only
excuse
for
living
you
never
know
what
that
means
and
when
things
grew
altogether
impossible
and
i
knew
that
i
must
earn
a
living
for
jock
and
myself
i
just
did
it
that
all
i
had
to
hortense
thought
that
over
for
one
deliberate
moment
her
brows
were
drawn
in
a
frown
i
tell
you
what
i
think
she
announced
at
last
though
i
know
that
i
can
just
exactly
put
it
into
words
i
mean
this
some
people
are
just
bound
to
to
give
to
build
up
things
to
well
to
manufacture
because
they
just
ca
help
it
it
in
and
got
to
come
out
dynamos
that
what
henry
technical
books
would
call
them
you
one
a
great
big
one
i
one
just
a
little
tiny
one
but
it
sparking
away
there
all
the
time
and
it
might
as
well
be
put
to
some
use
might
it
emma
bent
down
and
kissed
the
troubled
forehead
and
then
very
tenderly
the
pretty
puckered
lips
little
hortense
she
said
you
asking
a
great
big
question
i
can
answer
it
for
myself
but
i
ca
answer
it
for
you
it
too
dangerous
i
would
if
i
could
emma
waiting
in
the
hall
for
the
lift
looked
back
at
the
slim
little
figure
in
the
doorway
there
was
a
droop
to
the
shoulders
heart
smote
her
do
bother
your
head
about
all
this
little
girl
she
called
back
to
her
just
forget
to
be
ambitious
and
remember
to
be
happy
much
the
better
way
hortense
from
the
doorway
grinned
a
rather
wicked
little
grin
when
are
you
going
back
to
the
office
mrs
buck
she
asked
quietly
enough
what
makes
you
think
i
going
back
at
all
demanded
emma
stepping
into
the
shaky
little
elevator
i
do
think
it
retorted
hortense
once
more
the
pert
i
know
it
emma
knew
it
too
she
had
known
it
from
the
moment
that
she
shook
hands
in
her
compact
there
was
still
one
week
remaining
of
the
stipulated
three
months
it
seemed
to
emma
that
that
one
week
was
longer
than
the
combined
eleven
but
she
went
through
with
colors
flying
whatever
emma
mcchesney
buck
did
she
did
well
but
then
buck
had
done
his
part
well
too
so
well
that
on
the
final
day
emma
felt
a
sinking
at
her
heart
he
seemed
so
satisfied
with
affairs
as
they
were
he
was
apparently
so
content
to
drop
all
thought
of
business
when
he
left
the
office
for
his
home
emma
had
planned
a
very
special
little
dinner
that
evening
she
wore
a
very
special
gown
too
one
of
the
new
ones
noticed
it
at
once
and
the
dinner
as
well
being
that
kind
of
husband
still
annie
the
cook
complained
later
to
the
about
the
thanklessness
of
cooking
dinners
for
folks
who
did
eat
a
mouthful
anyway
dinner
over
well
emma
said
buck
light
your
cigar
said
emma
you
need
it
lighted
it
with
admirable
leisureliness
sent
out
a
great
puff
of
fragrant
smoke
and
surveyed
his
wife
through
lids
beneath
his
air
of
ease
there
was
a
tension
well
emma
he
said
again
gently
emma
looked
at
him
a
moment
appreciatively
she
had
too
much
poise
and
balance
and
control
herself
not
to
recognize
and
admire
those
qualities
in
others
if
i
had
been
what
they
call
a
homebody
we
would
be
married
would
we
no
you
knew
plenty
of
that
you
could
have
married
did
you
i
did
ask
them
emma
but
you
know
what
i
mean
now
listen
i
loafed
for
three
months
i
lolled
and
lazied
and
languished
and
i
never
been
so
tired
in
my
life
not
even
when
we
were
taking
january
inventory
another
month
of
this
and
i
be
an
old
old
woman
i
understand
now
what
it
is
that
brings
that
hard
tired
stony
look
into
the
faces
of
the
idle
women
they
have
to
work
so
hard
to
try
to
keep
happy
i
suppose
if
i
had
been
a
homebody
all
my
life
i
might
be
hardened
to
this
kind
of
thing
but
it
too
late
now
and
i
thankful
for
it
those
women
who
want
to
shop
and
dress
and
drive
and
play
are
welcome
to
my
share
of
it
if
i
am
to
be
punished
in
the
next
world
for
my
wickedness
in
this
i
know
what
form
my
torture
will
take
i
shall
have
to
go
from
shop
to
shop
with
a
piece
of
lace
in
my
hand
matching
a
sample
of
insertion
fifteen
years
of
being
in
the
thick
of
it
spoil
one
for
tatting
and
tea
the
world
is
full
of
homebodies
i
suppose
and
they
happy
i
suppose
i
might
have
been
one
too
if
i
been
obliged
to
get
out
and
hustle
but
it
too
late
to
learn
now
besides
i
do
want
to
if
i
do
try
i
be
destroying
the
very
thing
that
attracted
you
to
me
in
the
first
place
remember
what
you
said
about
the
fifth
avenue
girl
but
emma
interrupted
buck
very
quietly
i
do
want
you
to
try
emma
with
a
rush
of
words
at
her
very
lips
paused
eyed
him
for
a
doubtful
moment
asked
a
faltering
question
but
it
was
your
plan
you
said
you
wanted
me
to
be
here
when
you
came
home
and
when
you
left
did
you
do
you
mean
you
i
mean
that
i
missed
my
business
partner
every
minute
for
three
months
all
the
time
we
been
going
to
those
fool
dinners
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
i
been
bursting
to
talk
skirts
to
you
i
say
emma
adler
designed
a
new
model
a
full
one
of
course
but
something
wrong
with
it
i
ca
put
my
finger
on
the
flaw
but
emma
came
swiftly
over
to
his
chair
make
a
sketch
of
it
ca
you
she
said
from
his
pocket
buck
drew
a
pencil
an
envelope
and
fell
to
sketching
rapidly
squinting
down
through
his
cigar
smoke
as
he
worked
it
like
this
he
began
absorbed
and
happy
you
see
where
the
fulness
begins
at
the
knee
yes
prompted
emma
breathlessly
two
hours
later
they
were
still
bent
over
the
much
marked
bit
of
paper
but
their
interest
in
it
was
not
that
of
those
who
would
solve
a
perplexing
problem
it
was
the
lingering
satisfied
contemplation
of
a
task
accomplished
emma
straightened
leaned
back
sighed
a
victorious
happy
sigh
and
to
think
she
said
marveling
to
think
that
i
once
envied
the
women
who
had
nothing
to
do
but
the
things
i
done
in
the
last
three
months
buck
had
risen
stretched
luxuriously
yawned
now
he
came
over
to
his
wife
and
took
her
head
in
his
two
hands
cozily
and
stood
a
moment
looking
into
her
shining
eyes
emma
i
may
have
mentioned
this
once
or
twice
before
but
perhaps
you
still
be
interested
to
know
that
i
think
you
a
wonder
a
wonder
you
the
oh
well
we
wo
quarrel
about
that
smiled
emma
brazenly
but
i
wonder
if
adler
will
agree
with
us
when
he
sees
what
we
done
to
his
newest
skirt
design
suddenly
a
new
thought
seemed
to
strike
her
she
was
off
down
the
hall
buck
following
in
a
leisurely
manner
hands
in
pockets
stood
in
the
bedroom
door
and
watched
her
plunge
into
the
innermost
depths
of
the
what
the
idea
emma
looking
for
something
came
back
his
wife
muffled
tones
a
long
wait
can
i
help
i
got
it
cried
emma
and
emerged
triumphant
flushed
smiling
holding
a
garment
at
arm
length
aloft
what
emma
shook
it
smartly
turned
it
this
way
and
that
held
it
up
under
her
chin
by
the
sleeves
why
girl
exclaimed
buck
all
it
the
the
blue
serge
emma
finished
for
him
with
the
white
collars
and
cuffs
and
what
more
young
man
it
the
little
blue
hat
with
the
on
it
and
praise
be
i
wearing
both
morning
v
hoops
my
dear
emma
mcchesney
buck
always
vigorously
disclaimed
any
knowledge
of
that
damsel
known
as
inspiration
buck
her
accused
her
of
being
on
intimate
terms
with
the
lady
so
did
the
adoring
office
staff
of
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
out
in
the
workshop
itself
the
designers
and
cutters
those
jealous
artists
of
the
pencil
shears
and
yardstick
looked
on
in
awed
admiration
on
those
rare
occasions
when
the
feminine
member
of
the
business
took
the
scissors
in
her
firm
white
hands
and
slashed
boldly
into
a
shimmering
length
of
when
she
put
down
the
great
shears
there
lay
on
the
table
the
detached
parts
of
that
which
the
appreciative
and
experienced
eyes
of
the
craftsmen
knew
to
be
a
new
and
original
variation
of
that
elastic
garment
known
as
the
underskirt
for
weeks
preceding
one
of
these
emma
was
likely
to
be
not
quite
her
usual
brisk
self
a
mystic
glow
replaced
the
alert
brightness
of
her
eye
her
manner
gave
way
to
one
of
almost
sluggish
inactivity
the
outer
office
noting
these
things
would
lift
its
eyebrows
significantly
another
hunch
it
would
whisper
the
last
time
she
beat
the
rest
of
the
trade
by
six
weeks
with
that
gusset
inspiration
working
emma
buck
would
ask
noting
the
symptoms
it
is
inspiration
a
nothing
of
the
kind
it
just
an
attack
of
imagination
complicated
by
that
all
that
ails
poiret
buck
would
retort
early
in
the
autumn
when
women
were
still
walking
with
an
absurd
sidewise
gait
like
a
duck
or
a
filly
that
is
too
tightly
hobbled
the
junior
partner
of
the
firm
began
to
show
unmistakable
signs
of
business
aberration
a
blight
seemed
to
have
fallen
upon
her
bright
little
office
usually
humming
with
activity
the
machinery
of
her
day
ordinarily
as
noiseless
and
well
ordered
as
a
thing
on
ball
bearings
now
rasped
creaked
jerked
stood
still
jolted
on
again
a
bustling
clerk
or
stenographer
entering
with
paper
or
memorandum
would
find
her
bent
over
her
desk
pencil
in
hand
absorbed
in
a
rough
drawing
that
seemed
to
bear
no
relation
to
the
skirt
of
the
day
the
margin
of
her
morning
paper
was
filled
with
queer
little
scrawls
by
the
time
she
reached
the
office
she
drew
weird
lines
with
her
fork
on
the
at
lunch
these
hieroglyphics
she
covered
with
a
quick
hand
like
a
bashful
schoolgirl
when
any
one
peeped
tell
a
fellow
what
it
going
to
be
ca
you
pleaded
buck
i
got
one
glimpse
yesterday
when
you
did
know
i
was
looking
over
your
shoulder
it
seemed
a
pass
between
an
overgrown
zeppelin
and
an
apple
dumpling
so
i
know
it
ca
be
a
skirt
come
on
emma
tell
your
old
man
not
yet
emma
would
reply
dreamily
buck
would
strike
an
attitude
intended
to
intimidate
if
you
have
no
sense
of
what
is
due
me
as
your
husband
then
i
demand
as
senior
partner
of
this
firm
to
know
what
it
is
that
is
taking
your
time
which
rightfully
belongs
to
this
business
go
away
and
stop
pestering
me
what
do
you
think
designing
a
doily
buck
turning
to
go
to
his
own
office
threw
a
last
retort
over
his
shoulder
a
rather
sobering
one
this
time
whatever
it
is
it
had
better
be
good
with
business
what
it
is
and
skirts
what
they
are
emma
lifted
her
head
to
reply
to
that
it
is
what
they
are
that
interests
me
it
what
they
going
to
be
buck
paused
in
the
doorway
going
to
be
anybody
can
see
that
underneath
that
full
fool
flaring
the
real
skirt
is
as
tight
as
ever
i
do
think
the
spring
models
will
show
an
inch
of
real
difference
i
tell
you
emma
it
serious
emma
apparently
absorbed
in
her
work
did
not
reply
to
this
but
a
vague
something
about
the
back
of
her
head
told
buck
that
she
was
laughing
at
him
the
knowledge
only
gave
him
new
confidence
in
this
resourceful
lovable
of
his
two
weeks
went
by
four
six
eight
emma
began
to
look
a
little
thin
her
bright
color
was
there
only
when
she
was
overtired
or
excited
the
workrooms
began
to
talk
of
new
designs
for
spring
though
it
was
scarcely
the
head
designer
came
forward
timidly
with
a
skirt
that
measured
a
yard
around
the
bottom
emma
looked
at
it
tried
to
keep
her
lower
lip
prisoner
between
her
teeth
failed
and
began
to
laugh
helplessly
almost
hysterically
amazement
in
the
faces
of
buck
and
koritz
the
designer
became
consternation
then
in
the
designer
resentment
koritz
dark
undersized
with
the
eyes
of
an
oriental
and
the
lean
sensitive
fingers
of
one
who
creates
shivered
a
little
like
a
plant
that
is
swept
by
an
icy
blast
buck
came
over
and
laid
one
hand
on
his
wife
shaking
shoulder
emma
you
overtired
this
this
thing
you
been
slaving
over
has
been
too
much
for
you
with
one
hand
emma
reached
up
and
patted
the
fingers
that
rested
protectingly
on
her
shoulder
with
the
other
she
wiped
her
eyes
then
all
contrition
grasped
the
slender
brown
hand
of
the
offended
koritz
bennie
please
forgive
me
i
i
did
mean
to
laugh
i
laughing
at
your
new
skirt
you
think
it
too
wide
maybe
huh
bennie
koritz
said
and
held
it
up
doubtfully
too
wide
for
a
moment
emma
seemed
threatened
with
another
attack
of
that
inexplicable
laughter
she
choked
it
back
resolutely
no
bennie
not
too
wide
i
tell
you
why
i
laughed
then
perhaps
you
laugh
with
me
bennie
draping
his
despised
over
one
arm
had
the
courage
to
smile
even
now
though
grimly
i
laugh
sure
he
said
showing
his
white
teeth
now
but
the
laugh
will
be
i
bet
you
on
me
like
it
was
when
you
designed
that
knickerbocker
before
the
trade
knew
such
a
thing
could
be
impulsively
emma
grasped
his
hand
and
shook
it
as
though
she
found
a
certain
needed
encouragement
in
the
loyalty
of
this
sallow
little
russian
bennie
you
a
true
artist
because
you
big
enough
to
praise
the
work
of
a
fellow
craftsman
when
you
recognize
its
value
and
koritz
the
dull
red
showing
under
the
olive
of
his
cheeks
went
back
to
his
happy
buck
bent
forward
eagerly
you
going
to
tell
me
now
emma
it
finished
at
home
i
want
to
be
the
first
to
try
it
on
i
play
model
a
private
exhibition
just
for
you
it
not
only
finished
it
is
patented
patented
but
why
what
is
it
anyway
a
new
fastener
i
thought
it
was
a
skirt
wait
until
you
see
it
you
think
i
should
have
had
it
copyrighted
as
well
not
to
say
passed
by
the
national
board
of
censors
do
you
mean
to
say
that
i
to
be
the
entire
audience
at
the
premiere
of
this
new
model
you
are
to
be
audience
critic
orchestra
patron
and
jim
brady
now
run
along
into
your
own
office
wo
you
dear
i
want
to
get
out
these
letters
and
she
pressed
the
button
that
summoned
a
stenographer
buck
resigned
admiring
and
anticipatory
went
annie
the
cook
was
justified
that
evening
in
her
bitter
complaint
her
excellent
dinner
received
scant
enough
attention
from
these
two
they
hurried
through
it
like
eager
who
have
been
promised
a
treat
two
scarlet
spots
glowed
in
emma
cheeks
buck
eyes
through
the
haze
of
his
cigar
were
luminous
now
no
not
yet
i
want
you
to
smoke
your
cigar
and
digest
your
dinner
and
read
your
paper
i
want
you
to
twiddle
your
thumbs
a
little
and
look
at
your
watch
curtains
are
always
late
in
rising
are
they
well
she
turned
on
the
full
glare
of
the
chandelier
turned
it
off
went
about
flicking
on
the
wall
lights
and
the
lamps
turn
your
chair
so
that
your
back
will
be
toward
the
door
he
turned
it
obediently
emma
vanished
from
the
direction
of
her
bedroom
there
presently
came
the
sounds
of
dresser
drawers
hurriedly
opened
and
shut
with
a
bang
of
a
slipper
dropped
on
the
floor
a
tune
hummed
in
an
absorption
under
the
breath
an
excited
little
laugh
nervously
stifled
buck
in
his
role
of
audience
began
to
clap
impatiently
and
to
stamp
with
his
feet
on
the
floor
no
gallery
emma
called
in
from
the
hall
remember
the
temperamental
family
on
the
floor
below
a
silence
then
coming
shut
your
eyes
and
prepare
to
be
jarred
by
the
buck
there
was
a
rustling
of
silks
a
little
rush
to
the
center
of
the
big
room
a
breathless
pause
a
sharp
snap
of
finger
and
thumb
buck
opened
his
eyes
he
opened
his
eyes
then
he
closed
them
and
opened
them
again
quickly
as
we
do
sometimes
when
we
are
unwilling
to
believe
that
which
we
see
what
he
beheld
was
this
a
very
pretty
very
flushed
very
woman
her
blond
hair
dressed
quaintly
after
the
fashion
of
the
early
her
arms
and
shoulders
bare
a
with
in
lieu
of
a
bodice
and
he
passed
a
bewildered
hand
over
his
eyes
a
skirt
that
billowed
and
flared
and
flounced
and
spread
in
a
great
graceful
circle
a
skirt
strangely
light
for
all
its
fulness
a
skirt
like
and
yet
somehow
unlike
those
garments
seen
in
ancient
copies
of
godey
lady
book
that
ca
be
you
do
mean
what
what
is
it
stammered
buck
dismayed
emma
her
arms
curved
above
her
head
like
a
pirouetted
curtsied
very
low
so
that
the
skirt
spread
all
about
her
on
the
floor
like
the
petals
of
a
flower
hoops
my
dear
hoops
echoed
buck
in
weak
protest
hoops
my
dear
emma
stroked
one
silken
fold
with
approving
fingers
our
new
leader
for
spring
but
emma
you
joking
she
stared
suddenly
serious
you
mean
you
do
like
it
like
it
for
a
costume
yes
but
as
a
petticoat
for
wear
to
be
made
up
by
us
for
our
customers
but
of
course
you
playing
a
trick
on
me
he
laughed
a
little
weakly
and
came
toward
her
you
ca
catch
me
that
way
old
girl
it
darned
becoming
emma
i
say
that
he
bent
down
smiling
i
allow
you
to
kiss
me
and
then
try
me
with
the
real
surprise
will
you
her
coquetry
vanished
her
smile
fled
with
it
her
pretty
pose
was
abandoned
buck
wife
gave
way
to
emma
mcchesney
buck
business
woman
she
stiffened
a
little
as
though
bracing
herself
for
a
verbal
encounter
you
get
used
to
it
i
expected
you
to
be
jolted
at
the
first
shock
of
it
i
was
myself
when
the
idea
came
to
me
buck
passed
a
frenzied
forefinger
under
his
collar
as
though
it
had
suddenly
grown
too
tight
for
him
used
to
it
i
do
want
to
get
used
to
it
it
preposterous
you
ca
be
serious
no
woman
would
wear
a
garment
like
that
for
five
years
skirts
have
been
tighter
and
tighter
until
this
summer
they
became
tightest
interrupted
emma
they
could
go
no
farther
i
knew
that
meant
face
i
knew
it
meant
not
a
slightly
wider
skirt
but
a
wildly
wider
skirt
a
skirt
as
bouffant
as
the
other
had
been
scant
i
was
sure
it
would
be
a
gradual
process
at
all
but
a
mushroom
growth
hobbles
hoops
study
the
history
of
women
clothes
and
you
find
that
has
always
been
true
look
here
emma
began
buck
desperately
you
wrong
all
wrong
here
let
me
throw
this
scarf
over
your
shoulders
now
we
sit
down
and
talk
this
thing
over
sensibly
i
agree
to
the
scarf
she
drew
a
soft
silken
fringed
shawl
about
her
and
immediately
one
thought
of
a
certain
vivid
brilliant
portrait
of
a
dancer
but
do
ask
me
to
sit
down
i
rebound
like
a
toy
balloon
i
got
to
convince
you
of
this
thing
i
have
to
do
it
standing
buck
sank
into
his
chair
and
dabbed
at
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
you
never
convince
me
sitting
or
standing
emma
i
know
i
fought
the
knickerbocker
when
you
originated
it
and
i
know
that
it
turned
out
to
be
a
magnificent
success
but
this
is
different
the
knicker
was
practical
this
thing
absurd
it
impossible
this
is
an
age
of
activity
in
civil
war
days
women
minced
daintily
along
when
they
walked
at
all
they
stitched
on
samplers
by
way
of
diversion
what
has
all
that
to
do
with
it
inquired
emma
sweetly
everything
use
a
little
logic
logic
in
a
discussion
about
women
dress
i
surprised
but
emma
be
reasonable
good
lord
you
usually
enough
our
mode
of
living
has
changed
in
the
last
fifty
years
our
methods
of
transit
our
pastimes
customs
everything
imagine
a
woman
trying
to
climb
a
fifth
avenue
in
one
of
those
things
fancy
her
in
a
hot
set
of
tennis
women
use
automobiles
airships
can
you
see
a
subway
train
full
of
clerks
stenographers
and
models
steps
are
built
for
it
elevators
ca
stand
for
it
apartments
wo
accommodate
they
fantastic
wild
improbable
you
wrong
emma
all
wrong
she
had
listened
patiently
enough
never
once
attempting
to
interrupt
but
on
her
lips
was
the
maddening
of
one
whose
rebuttal
is
ready
now
she
perched
for
a
moment
at
the
extreme
edge
of
the
arm
of
a
chair
her
skirt
subsided
decorously
buck
noticed
that
with
surprise
even
in
the
midst
of
his
heated
protest
you
probably
forgotten
but
those
are
the
very
arguments
used
when
the
hobble
was
introduced
preposterous
people
said
impossible
women
could
walk
in
would
could
sit
down
in
women
could
run
play
tennis
skate
in
them
the
car
steps
were
too
high
for
them
well
what
happened
women
had
to
walk
in
them
and
a
new
gait
became
the
fashion
women
took
lessons
in
how
to
sit
down
in
them
they
slashed
them
for
tennis
and
skating
and
companies
all
over
the
country
lowered
the
car
steps
to
accommodate
them
what
true
for
the
hobble
holds
good
for
the
hoop
women
will
cease
to
and
learn
to
undulate
when
they
walk
they
widen
the
car
platforms
they
sit
on
top
the
fifth
avenue
and
you
never
give
them
a
second
thought
the
things
do
stay
where
they
belong
i
seen
misbehave
in
musical
comedies
argued
buck
miserably
that
where
my
patent
comes
in
the
old
hoop
was
cumbersome
unwieldy
clumsy
the
new
skirt
by
my
patent
featherboning
process
is
made
light
graceful
easily
managed
i
predict
that
by
midsummer
a
tight
skirt
will
be
as
rare
a
sight
as
a
full
one
was
a
year
ago
nonsense
we
not
quarreling
are
we
quarreling
i
rather
think
not
a
man
can
have
his
own
opinion
ca
he
it
appeared
however
that
he
could
not
for
when
they
had
threshed
it
out
inch
by
inch
as
might
two
partners
whose
only
bond
was
business
it
was
emma
who
won
remember
i
not
convinced
buck
warned
her
i
only
beaten
by
superior
force
but
i
do
believe
in
your
woman
intuition
i
say
that
it
has
never
gone
wrong
i
banking
on
it
it
woman
intuition
when
we
win
emma
observed
thoughtfully
when
we
lose
it
a
foolish
feminine
notion
there
were
to
be
no
measures
the
skirt
was
to
be
the
feature
of
the
spring
line
cutters
and
designers
were
one
with
buck
in
thinking
it
a
freak
garment
emma
reminded
them
that
the
same
thing
had
been
said
of
the
hobble
on
its
appearance
in
february
billy
spalding
veteran
led
a
flying
wedge
of
six
on
a
that
included
the
middle
west
and
the
coast
their
had
to
be
rebuilt
to
accommodate
the
new
model
spalding
whistling
dolorously
eyed
each
garment
with
a
look
of
bristling
antagonism
spalding
sold
skirts
on
commission
emma
surveying
his
labors
lifted
a
quizzical
eyebrow
if
you
going
to
sell
that
skirt
as
enthusiastically
as
you
pack
it
you
better
stay
here
in
new
york
and
save
the
house
traveling
expenses
spalding
ceased
to
whistle
he
held
up
a
billowy
sample
and
gazed
at
it
honestly
buck
you
know
i
try
to
sell
pretzels
in
london
if
you
asked
me
to
but
do
you
really
think
any
woman
alive
would
be
caught
wearing
a
garment
like
this
in
these
days
not
only
do
i
think
it
billy
i
certain
of
it
this
new
petticoat
makes
me
the
lincoln
of
the
skirt
trade
i
literally
freeing
my
sisters
from
the
shackles
that
have
bound
their
ankles
for
five
years
spalding
unimpressed
folded
another
skirt
um
maybe
but
what
that
line
about
slaves
hugging
their
chains
the
day
following
spalding
and
his
flying
squad
scattered
to
spread
the
light
among
the
skirt
trade
and
things
went
wrong
from
the
start
the
first
week
showed
an
ominous
lack
of
those
cheering
epistles
beginning
enclosed
please
find
etc
the
second
was
worse
the
third
was
equally
bad
the
fourth
was
final
the
second
week
in
march
spalding
returned
from
a
territory
which
had
always
been
known
as
firmly
wedded
to
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
the
middle
west
would
have
none
of
him
they
held
the
in
emma
bright
little
office
and
that
lady
herself
seemed
to
be
strangely
sunny
and
undaunted
considering
the
completeness
of
her
defeat
she
sat
at
her
desk
now
very
interested
very
very
calm
buck
in
a
chair
at
the
side
of
her
desk
was
interested
too
but
not
so
calm
spalding
who
was
accustomed
to
talk
while
standing
leaned
against
the
desk
feet
crossed
brows
furrowed
as
he
talked
he
emphasized
his
remarks
by
jabbing
the
air
with
his
pencil
well
said
emma
quietly
it
did
go
it
did
even
start
corrected
spalding
but
why
demanded
buck
why
spalding
leaned
forward
a
little
eagerly
i
tell
you
something
when
i
started
out
with
that
little
garment
i
thought
it
was
a
joke
before
i
been
out
with
it
a
week
i
began
to
like
it
in
ten
days
i
was
crazy
about
it
and
i
believed
in
it
from
the
waistband
to
the
hem
on
the
level
buck
i
think
it
a
wonder
now
can
you
explain
that
yes
said
emma
you
did
like
it
at
first
because
it
was
a
shock
to
you
it
outraged
all
your
ideas
of
what
a
skirt
ought
to
be
then
you
grew
accustomed
to
it
then
you
began
to
see
its
good
points
why
could
you
make
the
trade
get
your
viewpoint
this
is
why
out
in
manistee
and
oshkosh
and
terre
haute
the
girls
have
just
really
learned
the
trick
of
walking
in
tight
skirts
it
as
impossible
to
convince
a
middle
west
buyer
that
the
exaggerated
full
skirt
is
going
to
be
worn
next
summer
as
it
would
be
to
prove
to
him
that
men
are
going
to
wear
sunbonnets
they
thought
i
was
trying
to
sell
masquerade
costumes
i
may
believe
in
it
and
you
may
believe
in
it
and
but
the
girls
from
joplin
well
they
from
joplin
and
they
waiting
to
hear
from
headquarters
buck
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
and
sat
up
with
a
little
sigh
well
that
settles
it
does
it
he
said
it
does
not
replied
emma
mcchesney
buck
crisply
if
they
want
to
hear
from
headquarters
they
wo
have
long
to
wait
now
emma
do
try
to
push
this
thing
if
it
please
do
look
so
forgiving
i
much
rather
have
you
reproach
me
it
you
i
thinking
of
not
the
skirt
but
i
want
you
to
think
of
the
skirt
too
we
gone
into
this
thing
and
it
has
cost
us
thousands
do
think
i
going
to
sit
quietly
by
and
watch
those
thousands
trickle
out
of
our
hands
played
our
first
card
it
did
take
a
trick
here
another
buck
and
spalding
were
leaning
forward
interested
attentive
there
was
that
in
emma
vivid
glowing
face
which
did
not
mean
defeat
march
fifteenth
at
madison
square
garden
there
is
to
be
held
the
first
annual
exhibition
of
the
society
for
the
promotion
of
american
styles
for
american
women
for
one
hundred
years
we
taken
our
fashions
as
paris
dictated
regardless
of
whether
they
outraged
our
sense
of
humor
or
decency
or
of
fitness
this
year
the
american
designer
is
going
to
have
a
chance
am
i
an
american
designer
billy
yes
in
chorus
then
i
shall
exhibit
that
skirt
on
a
live
model
at
the
first
annual
american
fashion
show
next
month
every
in
the
country
will
be
there
if
it
takes
hold
there
it
made
and
so
are
we
march
came
and
with
it
an
army
of
men
and
women
buyers
dependent
for
the
first
time
in
their
business
careers
on
the
ingenuity
of
the
american
brain
the
legions
that
had
advanced
on
europe
early
armed
with
letters
of
credit
the
vast
horde
that
returned
each
spring
and
autumn
laden
with
their
spoils
hats
gowns
laces
linens
silks
embroideries
were
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
what
was
to
be
found
in
their
own
camp
clever
manager
that
she
was
emma
took
as
much
pains
with
her
model
as
with
the
skirt
itself
she
chose
a
girl
whose
demure
prettiness
and
quiet
charm
would
enhance
the
possibilities
of
the
practicability
in
the
eye
of
the
shrewd
buyer
gertrude
the
model
developed
a
real
interest
in
the
success
of
the
petticoat
emma
knew
enough
about
the
psychology
of
crowds
to
realize
how
this
increased
her
chances
for
success
the
much
heralded
fashion
show
was
to
open
at
one
on
the
afternoon
of
march
fifteenth
at
ten
that
morning
there
breezed
in
from
chicago
a
tall
slim
alert
young
man
who
made
straight
for
the
offices
of
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
walked
into
the
junior
partner
private
office
and
took
that
astonished
lady
in
his
two
strong
arms
jock
mcchesney
gasped
his
rumpled
mother
emerging
from
the
hug
i
been
hungry
for
a
sight
of
you
she
was
submerged
in
a
second
hug
come
here
to
the
window
where
i
can
get
a
real
look
at
you
why
did
you
wire
me
what
are
you
doing
away
from
your
own
job
business
and
why
come
of
all
days
when
i
ca
make
a
fuss
over
you
jock
mcchesney
steady
of
hand
stood
up
well
under
the
satisfied
scrutiny
of
his
adoring
mother
he
smiled
down
at
her
wanted
to
surprise
you
here
for
three
reasons
the
abbott
advertising
contract
you
and
grace
and
why
ca
you
make
a
fuss
over
me
i
like
to
know
emma
told
him
his
keen
quick
mind
required
little
in
the
way
of
explanation
but
why
did
you
let
me
in
on
it
sooner
because
son
nothing
explains
harder
than
embryo
success
i
always
prefer
to
wait
until
it
grown
up
and
let
it
do
its
own
explaining
but
the
thing
ought
to
have
national
advertising
jock
insisted
with
the
advertising
expert
lightning
grasp
of
its
possibilities
what
that
skirt
needs
is
publicity
why
did
you
let
me
handle
yes
i
know
dear
but
you
have
seen
the
skirt
it
wo
do
to
ram
it
down
their
throats
i
want
to
ease
it
to
them
first
i
want
them
to
get
used
to
it
it
failed
utterly
on
the
road
because
it
jarred
their
notion
of
what
a
petticoat
ought
to
be
that
due
to
five
years
of
sheath
skirts
but
suppose
just
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it
does
strike
them
right
this
afternoon
then
it
gone
that
all
six
months
from
now
every
in
the
country
will
be
manufacturing
a
similar
garment
people
will
be
ready
for
it
then
i
just
tried
to
cut
in
ahead
of
the
rest
perhaps
i
should
have
tried
to
do
it
jock
hugged
her
again
at
that
to
the
edification
of
the
office
windows
across
the
way
gad
you
a
wiz
mother
now
listen
i
grace
when
i
got
in
she
going
to
meet
me
here
at
one
i
chase
over
to
the
office
now
on
this
thing
and
come
back
here
in
time
for
lunch
is
in
i
look
in
on
him
a
minute
we
all
lunch
together
and
then
ca
do
it
son
the
show
opens
at
one
gertrude
my
model
comes
on
at
three
she
going
to
have
the
stage
to
herself
for
ten
minutes
during
which
she
make
four
changes
of
costume
to
demonstrate
the
usefulness
of
the
skirt
for
every
sort
of
gown
from
chiffon
to
velvet
come
back
here
at
one
if
you
like
if
i
not
here
come
over
to
the
show
but
lunch
i
choke
at
there
scampered
into
emma
office
a
very
little
emma
deep
in
a
discussion
with
buck
had
a
premonition
of
trouble
before
the
girl
gasped
out
her
message
oh
buck
gertie
awful
sick
sick
echoed
emma
and
buck
in
duet
then
emma
but
she
ca
be
it
impossible
she
was
all
right
a
half
hour
ago
she
was
hurrying
down
the
hall
as
she
spoke
where
is
she
they
got
her
on
one
of
the
tables
in
the
workroom
she
moaning
awful
gertie
appendix
with
that
innate
sense
of
the
dramatic
so
often
found
in
temperamental
appendices
had
indeed
chosen
this
moment
to
call
attention
to
itself
gertie
the
demurely
pretty
and
quietly
charming
was
rolled
in
a
very
tight
ball
on
the
workroom
at
one
she
was
on
her
way
home
in
a
cab
under
the
care
of
a
doctor
miss
kelly
the
bookkeeper
and
jock
who
coming
in
gaily
at
one
had
been
pressed
into
service
bewildered
but
willing
three
rather
tragic
figures
stared
at
one
another
in
the
junior
partner
office
they
were
emma
buck
and
grace
galt
grace
galt
slim
lovely
girlish
was
known
at
as
one
of
the
most
expert
copy
writers
in
the
advertising
world
in
her
capable
manner
she
tried
to
suggest
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
now
but
surely
the
world
full
of
girls
she
said
it
late
i
know
but
any
theatrical
agency
will
send
a
girl
over
that
just
what
i
tried
to
avoid
emma
replied
i
wanted
to
show
this
skirt
on
a
sweet
pretty
refined
sort
of
girl
who
looks
and
acts
like
a
lady
one
of
those
blond
show
girls
would
kill
it
gloom
settled
down
again
over
the
three
emma
broke
the
silence
with
a
rueful
little
laugh
i
think
she
said
that
perhaps
you
right
and
this
is
the
lord
way
of
showing
me
that
the
world
is
not
quite
ready
for
this
skirt
you
not
beaten
yet
emma
buck
assured
her
vigorously
how
about
this
new
girl
what
her
name
myrtle
she
one
of
those
thin
limp
ones
is
she
try
her
i
will
said
emma
you
right
i
not
beaten
yet
i
had
to
fight
for
everything
worth
while
in
my
life
i
superstitious
about
it
now
when
things
come
easy
i
afraid
of
them
then
to
the
annie
tell
myrtle
i
want
to
see
her
silence
fell
again
upon
the
three
myrtle
very
limp
very
thin
very
languid
indeed
roused
them
at
her
entrance
the
hopeful
look
in
emma
eyes
faded
as
she
beheld
her
myrtle
was
so
obviously
limp
so
hopelessly
new
annie
says
you
want
me
to
take
gertie
place
drawled
myrtle
striking
a
attitude
i
do
know
that
you
are
just
the
er
type
but
perhaps
if
willing
of
course
i
did
come
here
as
a
model

myrtle
and
sagged
on
the
other
hip
but
as
a
special
favor
to
you
i
willing
to
try
it
at
special
model
rates
emma
ran
a
somewhat
frenzied
hand
through
her
hair
then
as
a
special
favor
to
me
will
you
begin
by
trying
to
stand
up
straight
please
that
debutante
slouch
would
kill
a
coronation
costume
myrtle
straightened
slumped
again
i
ca
help
it
if
i
am
willowy
listlessly
your
hair
myrtle
hand
went
vaguely
to
her
head
i
ca
have
you
wear
it
that
way
why
this
is
the
french
roll
protested
myrtle
offended
then

it
in
a
german
bun
snapped
emma
any
way
but
that
will
you
walk
please
walk
dully
yes
walk
i
want
to
see
how
you
myrtle
walked
across
the
room
a
groan
came
from
emma
i
thought
so
she
took
a
long
breath
myrtle
listen
that
australian
crawl
was
necessary
when
our
skirts
were
so
narrow
we
had
to
negotiate
a
curbing
before
we
could
take
it
but
the
skirt
you
going
to
demonstrate
is
wide
like
that
practically
a
free
woman
in
it
step
out
stride
swing
walk
myrtle
tried
it
stumbled
sulked
emma
half
smiling
half
woeful
patted
the
girl
shoulder
oh
i
see
you
wearing
a
tight
one
well
run
in
and
get
into
the
skirt
miss
loeb
will
help
you
then
come
back
here
and
quickly
please
the
three
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
it
was
a
silence
brimming
with
eloquent
meaning
each
sought
encouragement
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
and
failed
to
find
it
failing
they
broke
into
helpless
laughter
it
proved
a
she
may
do
emma
when
she
has
her
hair
done
differently
and
if
she
only
stand
up
but
emma
shook
her
head
something
tells
me
you
going
to
have
a
wonderful
chance
to
say
told
you
so
at
three
this
afternoon
you
know
i
would
say
it
emma
yes
i
do
know
it
dear
but
what
the
difference
if
the
chance
is
there
suspense
settled
down
on
the
little
office
billy
spalding
entered
smiling
after
five
minutes
of
waiting
even
his
buoyant
spirits
sank
do
you
think
if
you
were
to
go
in
and
and
sort
of
help
adjust
things
suggested
buck
vaguely
no
i
do
want
to
prop
her
up
she
have
to
stand
alone
when
she
gets
there
she
either
do
or
not
when
she
enters
that
door
know
when
myrtle
entered
wearing
the
fascinatingly
fashioned
new
model
they
all
knew
emma
spoke
decisively
that
settles
it
what
the
matter
do
it
look
all
right
demanded
myrtle
take
it
off
myrtle
then
to
the
others
as
myrtle
sulking
left
the
room
i
can
stand
to
see
that
skirt
die
if
necessary
but
i
wo
help
murder
it
but
buck
protested
spalding
almost
tearfully
you
got
to
exhibit
that
skirt
you
got
to
emma
shook
a
sorrowing
head
that
would
be
an
exhibition
billy
it
would
be
an
expose
spalding
clapped
a
desperate
hand
to
his
bald
head
if
only
i
had
julian
eltinge
shape
i
wear
it
to
the
show
for
you
myself
that
all
it
needs
now
retorted
emma
grimly
whereupon
grace
galt
spoke
up
in
her
clear
decisive
voice
wait
a
minute
she
said
quietly
i
going
to
wear
that
skirt
at
the
fashion
show
you
cried
the
three
like
a
trained
trio
why
not
demanded
grace
galt
coolly
then
no
do
tell
me
why
not
i
wo
listen
but
emma
equally
cool
would
have
none
of
it
it
impossible
dear
you
an
angel
to
want
to
help
me
but
you
must
know
it
quite
out
of
the
question
it
nothing
of
the
kind
this
skirt
is
merely
a
fad
it
has
a
fortune
in
it
i
business
woman
enough
to
know
that
you
got
to
let
me
do
it
it
is
only
for
yourself
it
for
and
for
the
future
of
the
firm
do
you
suppose
i
allow
you
to
stand
up
before
all
those
people
why
not
i
do
know
them
they
do
know
me
i
can
make
them
get
the
idea
in
that
skirt
and
i
going
to
do
it
you
do
object
to
me
on
the
same
grounds
that
you
did
to
myrtle
do
you
you
burst
from
the
admiring
spalding
say
you
make
a
petticoat
look
like
crepe
de
chine
and
lace
there
said
grace
triumphant
that
settles
it
and
she
was
off
down
the
hall
they
stood
a
moment
in
stunned
silence
then
but
jock
protested
emma
following
her
what
will
jock
say
grace
grace
dear
i
ca
let
you
do
it
i
ca
just
unhook
this
for
me
will
you
replied
grace
galt
sweetly
at
two
jock
mcchesney
returned
from
his
errand
of
mercy
burst
into
the
office
to
find
mother
and
fiancee
all
flown
where
what
he
demanded
of
the
outer
office
fashion
show
chorused
the
office
staff
might
have
waited
for
me
jock
said
to
himself
much
injured
and
hurled
himself
into
a
taxi
there
was
a
crush
of
motors
and
carriages
for
a
block
on
all
sides
of
madison
square
garden
he
had
to
wait
for
what
seemed
an
interminable
time
at
the
then
he
began
the
task
of
worming
his
way
through
the
throng
in
the
great
auditorium
it
was
a
crowd
such
as
the
great
place
had
not
seen
since
the
palmy
days
of
the
horse
show
it
was
a
crowd
that
sparkled
and
shone
in
silks
and
feathers
and
furs
and
jewels
jove
if
mother
has
half
a
chance
at
this
gang
jock
told
himself
if
only
she
has
grabbed
some
one
who
can
really
show
that
skirt
he
was
swept
with
the
crowd
toward
a
high
platform
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
auditorium
all
about
that
platform
stood
hundreds
close
packed
faces
raised
eagerly
the
better
to
see
the
slight
graceful
girlish
figure
occupying
the
center
of
the
stage
a
figure
strangely
familiar
to
jock
eyes
in
spite
of
its
quaintly
billowing
garb
she
was
speaking
jock
mouth
agape
eyes
protruding
ears
straining
heard
as
in
a
daze
the
sweet
clear
charmingly
modulated
voice
the
feature
of
the
skirt
ladies
and
gentlemen
is
that
it
gives
a
fulness
without
weight
something
which
the
has
never
before
been
able
to
achieve
this
is
due
to
the
patent
featherboning
process
invented
by
buck
of
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
new
york
note
please
that
it
has
all
the
advantages
of
our
grandmother
but
none
of
its
awkward
features
it
is
graceful
she
turned
slowly
lightly
it
is
bouffant
she
twirled
on
her
toes
it
is
practical
serviceable
elegant
it
can
be
made
up
in
any
shade
in
any
material
silk
lace
crepe
de
chine
charmeuse
taffeta
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
is
prepared
to
fill
orders
for
immediate
well
i
be
darned
said
jock
mcchesney
aloud
and
again
heedless
of
the
protesting
that
his
neighbors
turned
upon
him
well
i
be
darned
a
hand
twitched
his
coat
sleeve
he
turned
still
dazed
his
mother
very
very
pulled
him
through
the
throng
as
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
crowd
there
came
a
great
burst
of
applause
a
buzz
of
conversation
the
turning
shifting
nodding
staccato
movements
which
mean
approval
in
a
mass
of
people
what
the
dickens
how
stammered
jock
when
did
she
did
she
emma
half
smiling
half
tearful
raised
a
protesting
hand
i
do
know
do
ask
me
dear
and
do
hate
me
for
it
i
tried
to
tell
her
not
to
but
she
insisted
and
jock
she
done
it
i
tell
you
she
done
it
they
love
the
skirt
listen
to
do
want
to
said
jock
lead
me
to
her
angry
dear
me
no
i
i
proud
of
her
she
has
only
brains
and
looks
that
little
girl
she
got
nerve
the
real
kind
gee
how
did
i
ever
have
the
gall
to
ask
her
to
marry
me
together
they
sped
toward
the
door
that
led
to
the
buck
his
fine
eyes
more
luminous
than
ever
as
he
looked
at
this
of
his
met
them
at
the
entrance
she
waiting
for
you
jock
he
said
smiling
jock
took
the
steps
in
one
leap
well
t
said
emma
well
emma
said
a
which
burst
of
eloquence
was
interrupted
abruptly
by
a
short
squat
dark
man
who
seized
emma
hand
in
his
left
and
buck
in
his
right
and
pumped
them
up
and
down
vigorously
it
was
that
volatile
voluble
person
known
to
the
skirt
trade
as
abel
fromkin
of
the
fromkin
skirt
it
clings
i
looking
everywhere
for
you
he
panted
then
his
shrewd
little
eyes
narrowing
you
want
to
talk
business
not
here
said
buck
abruptly
sure
here
insisted
fromkin
say
that
me
when
i
got
a
thing
on
my
mind
i
like
to
settle
it
how
much
you
take
for
the
rights
to
that
skirt
take
for
it
exclaimed
emma
in
the
tone
a
mother
would
use
to
one
who
has
suggested
taking
a
beloved
child
from
her
now
wait
a
minute
do
get
mad
you
ai
started
that
skirt
right
it
should
have
been
advertised
it
too
much
of
a
shock
you
see
they
wo
buy
they
afraid
of
it
i
take
it
off
your
hands
and
push
it
right
see
i
offer
you
forty
thousand
for
the
rights
to
make
that
skirt
and
advertise
it
as
the
skirt
it
flares
emma
smiled
how
much
she
asked
quizzically
abel
fromkin
gulped
fifty
thousand
he
said
fifty
thousand
repeated
emma
quietly
and
looked
at
buck
thanks
fromkin
i
know
now
that
if
it
worth
fifty
thousand
to
you
as
the
skirt
it
flares
then
it
worth
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
to
us
as
the
buck
it
billows
and
it
was
vi
sisters
under
their
skin
women
who
know
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
a
pay
envelope
do
not
speak
of
girls
who
work
as
working
girls
neither
do
they
use
the
term
laboring
class
as
one
would
speak
of
a
distinct
and
separate
race
like
the
ethiopian
emma
mcchesney
buck
was
no
exception
to
this
rule
her
fifteen
years
of
work
for
a
salary
in
the
employ
of
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
company
new
york
precluded
that
in
those
days
she
had
been
emma
mcchesney
known
from
coast
to
coast
as
the
most
successful
traveling
saleswoman
in
the
business
it
was
due
to
her
that
no
feminine
was
complete
without
a
featherloom
dangling
from
one
hook
during
those
fifteen
years
she
had
educated
her
son
jock
mcchesney
and
made
a
man
of
him
she
had
worked
fought
saved
triumphed
smiled
under
hardship
and
she
had
acquired
a
broad
and
deep
knowledge
of
those
fascinating
and
diversified
subjects
which
we
lump
carelessly
under
the
heading
of
human
nature
she
was
buck
now
wife
of
the
head
of
the
firm
and
partner
in
the
most
successful
skirt
manufactory
in
the
country
but
the
habits
of
those
fifteen
years
still
clung
perhaps
this
explained
why
every
in
the
big
bright
shop
back
of
the
offices
raised
adoring
eyes
when
emma
entered
the
workroom
italian
german
hungarian
russian
they
lifted
their
faces
toward
this
source
of
love
and
sympathetic
understanding
as
naturally
as
a
plant
turns
its
leaves
toward
the
sun
they
glowed
under
her
praise
they
confided
to
her
their
troubles
they
came
to
her
with
their
joys
and
they
copied
her
clothes
this
last
caused
her
some
uneasiness
when
buck
wore
blue
serge
an
epidemic
of
blue
serge
broke
out
in
the
workroom
did
spring
hat
flaunt
flowers
the
elevators
at
closing
time
looked
like
gardens
abloom
if
she
appeared
on
monday
morning
in
severely
tailored
blouse
the
shop
on
tuesday
was
a
boston
seminary
in
its
starched
primness
it
worries
me
emma
told
her
i
ca
help
thinking
of
the
story
of
the
girl
and
the
pet
chameleon
what
would
happen
if
i
were
to
forget
myself
some
day
and
come
down
to
work
in
black
velvet
and
pearls
they
manage
it
somehow
buck
assured
her
i
do
know
just
how
but
i
sure
that
hours
later
our
shop
would
look
like
a
buckingham
when
the
court
is
in
mourning
emma
never
ceased
to
marvel
at
their
ingenuity
at
their
almost
uncanny
their
cheap
skirts
hung
and
fitted
with
an
art
as
perfect
as
that
of
a
street
modiste
their
blouses
in
some
miraculous
way
were
of
style
down
to
the
last
detail
of
cuff
or
collar
or
stitching
their
hats
were
of
the
shape
that
the
season
demanded
set
at
the
angle
that
the
season
approved
and
finished
with
just
that
repression
of
decoration
which
is
known
as
single
trimming
they
wore
their
clothes
with
a
chic
that
would
make
the
parisian
outriere
look
dowdy
and
down
at
heel
in
comparison
upper
fifth
avenue
during
the
shopping
or
has
been
sung
painted
vaunted
boasted
its
furs
and
millinery
its
eyes
and
figure
its
complexion
and
ankles
have
flashed
out
at
us
from
ten
thousand
magazine
covers
have
been
adjectived
in
reams
of
stories
who
will
picture
lower
fifth
avenue
between
five
and
six
when
new
york
unsung
beauties
pour
into
the
streets
from
a
thousand
theirs
is
no
mere
empty
prettiness
poverty
can
make
prettiness
almost
poignantly
lovely
for
it
works
with
a
scalpel
your
street
beauty
has
a
certain
wistful
appeal
that
your
street
beauty
lacks
her
very
bravado
too
which
falls
just
short
of
boldness
adds
a
final
piquant
touch
in
the
face
of
the
girl
who
works
whether
she
be
a
or
a
foreign
buyer
you
will
find
both
vivacity
and
depth
of
expression
what
she
loses
in
softness
and
bloom
she
gains
in
a
something
that
peeps
from
her
eyes
that
lurks
in
the
corners
of
her
mouth
emma
never
tired
of
studying
them
these
girls
with
their
firm
slim
throats
their
lovely
faces
their
oriental
eyes
and
their
conscious
grace
often
as
she
looked
an
unaccountable
mist
of
tears
would
blur
her
vision
so
that
sunny
little
room
whose
door
was
marked
buck
had
come
to
be
more
than
a
mere
private
office
for
the
transaction
of
business
it
was
a
for
trouble
it
was
a
shrine
a
confessional
and
a
court
of
justice
when
carmela
colarossi
her
face
swollen
with
weeping
told
a
story
of
parental
harshness
grown
unbearable
emma
would
put
aside
business
to
listen
and
six
would
find
her
seated
in
the
dark
and
smelly
colarossi
kitchen
trying
with
all
her
tact
and
patience
and
sympathy
to
make
home
life
possible
again
for
the
carmela
when
the
deft
brown
fingers
of
otti
markis
became
clumsy
at
her
machine
and
her
wage
slumped
unaccountably
from
sixteen
to
six
dollars
a
week
it
was
in
emma
quiet
little
office
that
it
became
clear
why
otti
eyes
were
shadowed
and
why
otti
mouth
drooped
so
pathetically
emma
prescribed
a
love
philter
made
up
of
common
sense
understanding
and
otti
took
it
only
half
comprehending
but
sure
of
its
power
in
a
week
otti
eyes
were
shadowless
her
lips
smiling
her
bulging
but
it
was
in
sophy
kumpf
that
the
buck
company
best
exemplified
its
policy
sophy
kumpf
had
come
to
buck
thirty
years
before
slim
she
was
a
grandmother
now
at
but
still
pink
of
cheek
and
brown
of
hair
in
those
thirty
years
she
had
spent
just
three
away
from
buck
she
had
brought
her
children
into
the
world
she
had
fed
them
and
clothed
them
and
sent
them
to
school
had
sophy
and
seen
them
married
and
helped
them
to
bring
their
children
into
the
world
in
turn
in
her
round
red
wholesome
face
shone
a
great
wisdom
much
love
and
that
infinite
understanding
which
is
born
only
of
bitter
experience
she
had
come
to
buck
when
old
was
just
beginning
to
make
featherlooms
a
national
institution
she
had
seen
his
struggles
his
prosperity
she
had
grieved
at
his
death
she
had
watched
young
take
the
reins
in
his
unaccustomed
hands
and
she
had
gloried
in
emma
mcchesney
rise
from
office
to
salesroom
from
salesroom
to
road
from
road
to
private
office
and
recognized
authority
sophy
had
left
her
early
work
far
behind
she
had
her
own
desk
now
in
the
busy
workshop
and
it
was
she
who
allotted
the
marked
it
in
her
ledger
that
powerful
ledger
which
at
the
week
end
decided
just
how
plump
or
thin
each
would
be
so
the
shop
and
office
at
buck
were
bound
together
by
many
ties
of
affection
and
sympathy
and
loyalty
and
these
bonds
were
strongest
where
at
one
end
they
touched
emma
mcchesney
buck
and
at
the
other
faithful
sophy
kumpf
each
a
triumphant
example
of
woman
in
business
it
was
at
this
comfortable
stage
of
featherloom
affairs
that
the
movement
struck
the
buck
company
emma
mcchesney
buck
had
never
mingled
much
in
movements
not
that
she
lacked
sympathy
with
them
she
often
approved
of
them
heart
and
soul
but
she
had
been
heard
to
say
that
the
movers
got
on
her
nerves
those
glib
staccato
ladies
who
spoke
with
such
ease
from
platforms
and
whose
pictures
stared
out
at
one
from
the
woman
page
failed
somehow
to
convince
her
when
emma
approved
a
new
movement
it
was
generally
in
spite
of
them
never
because
of
them
she
was
brazenly
unapologetic
when
she
said
that
she
would
rather
listen
to
ten
minutes
of
sophy
than
to
an
hour
talk
by
the
most
magnetic
and
spellbinder
in
any
cause
for
fifteen
business
years
in
the
office
on
the
road
and
in
the
thriving
workshop
emma
mcchesney
had
met
working
women
galore
women
in
offices
women
in
stores
women
in
hotels
clerks
buyers
waitresses
actresses
in
road
companies
women
demonstrators
occasional
traveling
saleswomen
women
in
factories
scrubwomen
stenographers
models
every
grade
type
and
variety
of
working
woman
trained
and
untrained
she
never
missed
a
chance
to
talk
with
them
she
never
failed
to
learn
from
them
she
had
been
one
of
them
and
still
was
she
was
in
the
position
of
one
who
is
on
the
inside
looking
out
those
other
women
urging
this
cause
or
that
were
on
the
outside
striving
to
peer
in
the
movement
struck
buck
at
eleven
monday
morning
eleven
monday
morning
in
the
middle
of
a
busy
fall
season
is
not
a
propitious
moment
for
idle
the
three
women
who
stepped
out
of
the
lift
at
the
buck
company
floor
looked
very
much
out
of
place
in
that
hummingly
busy
establishment
and
appeared
on
the
surface
at
least
very
indeed
so
much
so
that
buck
glancing
up
from
the
cards
which
had
preceded
them
had
difficulty
in
repressing
a
frown
of
annoyance
buck
during
his
and
for
a
lamentably
long
time
after
had
been
known
as
beau
buck
because
of
his
faultless
clothes
and
his
charming
manner
his
eyes
had
something
to
do
with
it
too
no
doubt
he
had
lived
down
the
title
by
sheer
force
of
business
ability
no
one
thought
of
using
the
nickname
now
though
the
clothes
the
manner
and
the
eyes
were
the
same
at
the
entrance
of
the
three
women
he
had
been
engrossed
in
the
difficult
task
of
selling
a
fall
line
to
mannie
nussbaum
of
portland
oregon
mannie
was
what
is
known
as
a
temperamental
buyer
he
be
forced
he
could
be
coaxed
he
could
be
led
but
when
he
liked
a
line
he
bought
like
mad
never
cancelled
and
buck
had
just
got
him
going
it
spoke
volumes
for
his
that
he
could
advance
toward
the
waiting
three
his
manner
correct
his
expression
bland
i
am
buck
he
said
buck
is
very
much
engaged
i
understand
your
visit
has
something
to
do
with
the
girls
in
the
shop
i
sure
our
manager
will
be
able
to
answer
any
questions
the
eldest
women
raised
a
protesting
hand
oh
no
no
indeed
we
must
see
mrs
buck
she
spoke
in
the
crisp
decisive
of
one
who
is
often
addressed
as
madam
chairman
buck
took
a
firmer
grip
on
his
i
sorry
buck
is
in
the
we
wait
said
the
lady
brightly
she
stepped
back
a
pace
this
is
miss
susan
croft
indicating
a
rather
sparse
person
of
very
certain
years
but
i
need
scarcely
introduce
her
scarcely
murmured
buck
and
wondered
why
this
is
my
daughter
miss
gladys
buck
found
himself
wondering
why
this
slim
negative
creature
should
have
such
sad
eyes
there
came
an
impatient
snort
from
mannie
nussbaum
buck
waved
a
hasty
hand
in
the
direction
of
emma
office
if
you
wait
there
i
send
in
to
mrs
buck
the
three
turned
toward
emma
bright
little
office
buck
scribbled
a
hasty
word
on
one
of
the
cards
emma
mcchesney
buck
was
leaning
over
the
great
shears
in
hand
it
might
almost
be
said
that
she
sprawled
her
eyes
were
very
bright
and
her
cheeks
were
very
pink
across
the
table
stood
a
designer
and
two
cutters
and
they
were
watching
emma
with
an
intentness
as
flattering
as
it
was
sincere
they
were
looking
not
only
at
cloth
but
at
an
idea
get
that
asked
emma
crisply
and
tapped
the
pattern
spread
before
her
with
the
point
of
her
shears
that
gives
you
the
fulness
without
bunching
see
sure
assented
koritz
head
designer
but
when
you
get
it
cut
find
this
piece
is
wasted
ai
it
he
marked
out
a
triangular
section
of
cloth
with
one
expert
forefinger
no
that
works
into
the
ruffle
explained
emma
here
i
cut
it
then
you
see
she
grasped
the
shears
firmly
in
her
right
hand
smoothed
the
cloth
spread
before
her
with
a
nervous
little
pat
of
her
left
pushed
her
bright
hair
back
from
her
forehead
and
prepared
to
cut
at
which
critical
moment
there
entered
annie
the
with
the
three
bits
of
white
pasteboard
emma
glanced
down
at
them
and
waved
annie
away
ca
see
them
busy
annie
stood
her
ground
buck
said
you
see
they
waiting
emma
picked
up
one
of
the
cards
on
it
buck
had
scribbled
a
single
word
movers
buck
smiled
a
little
malicious
gleam
came
into
her
eyes
show
in
here
annie
she
commanded
with
a
wave
of
the
huge
shears
i
teach
to
interrupt
me
when
i
got
my
hands
in
the
she
bent
over
the
table
again
measuring
with
her
keen
eye
when
the
three
were
ushered
in
a
moment
later
she
looked
up
briefly
and
nodded
then
bent
over
the
table
again
but
in
that
brief
moment
she
had
the
three
marked
indexed
and
pigeonholed
if
one
could
have
looked
into
that
lightning
mind
of
hers
one
would
have
found
something
like
this
hmm
what
ida
tarbell
calls
women
money
and
always
have
had
it
those
hats
were
born
in
one
of
those
exclusive
little
shops
off
the
avenue
rich
but
somber
they
think
they
advanced
but
they
still
resent
the
triumph
of
the
over
the
horse
that
girl
ca
call
her
soul
her
own
good
eyes
but
too
sad
he
probably
did
suit
mother
what
she
said
was
we
just
bringing
a
new
skirt
into
the
world
i
thought
you
might
like
to
be
in
at
the
birth
how
very
interesting
chirped
the
two
older
women
the
girl
said
nothing
but
a
look
of
anticipation
brightened
her
eyes
it
deepened
and
glowed
as
emma
mcchesney
buck
bent
to
her
task
and
the
great
jaws
of
the
shears
opened
and
shut
on
the
virgin
cloth
six
pairs
of
eyes
followed
the
fascinating
steel
before
which
the
cloth
rippled
and
fell
away
as
water
is
cleft
by
the
prow
of
a
stanch
little
boat
around
the
curves
went
the
shears
guided
by
emma
firm
white
hands
snipping
slashing
doubling
on
itself
a
very
swashbuckler
of
a
shears
there
exclaimed
emma
at
last
and
dropped
the
shears
on
the
table
with
a
clatter
put
that
together
and
see
whether
it
makes
a
skirt
or
not
now
ladies
the
three
drew
a
long
breath
it
was
the
sort
of
sound
that
comes
up
from
the
crowd
when
a
has
gone
off
successfully
with
a
final
shower
of
stars
do
you
do
that
often
ventured
often
enough
to
keep
my
hand
in
replied
emma
and
led
the
way
to
her
office
the
three
followed
in
silence
they
were
strangely
silent
too
as
they
seated
themselves
around
emma
buck
desk
curiously
enough
it
was
the
subdued
miss
who
was
the
first
to
speak
i
never
rest
she
said
until
i
see
that
skirt
finished
and
actually
ready
to
wear
she
smiled
at
emma
when
she
did
that
you
saw
that
miss
had
her
charm
emma
smiled
back
and
patted
the
girl
hand
just
once
at
that
there
came
a
look
into
miss
eyes
and
you
saw
that
most
decidedly
she
had
her
charm
up
spoke
gladys
is
such
an
enthusiast
that
really
her
reason
for
being
here
gladys
is
very
much
interested
in
working
girls
in
fact
we
are
all
as
you
probably
know
intensely
interested
in
the
working
woman
thank
you
said
emma
mcchesney
buck
that
very
kind
we
working
women
are
very
grateful
to
you
we
exclaimed
and
miss
susan
croft
blankly
and
in
perfect
time
emma
smiled
sweetly
surely
you
admit
that
i
a
working
woman
miss
susan
croft
was
not
a
person
to
be
trifled
with
she
elucidated
acidly
we
mean
women
who
work
with
their
hands
by
what
power
do
you
think
those
shears
were
moved
across
the
we
do
cut
our
patterns
with
an
rustled
protestingly
but
my
dear
buck
you
know
we
mean
women
of
the
laboring
class
i
in
this
place
of
business
from
nine
to
five
monday
to
saturday
inclusive
if
that
does
make
me
a
member
of
the
laboring
class
i
do
want
to
belong
it
was
here
that
showed
herself
a
woman
not
to
be
trifled
with
she
moved
forward
to
the
edge
of
her
chair
fixed
emma
buck
with
determined
eyes
and
swept
into
midstream
sails
spread
do
be
frivolous
buck
we
are
here
on
a
serious
errand
it
ought
to
interest
you
vitally
because
of
the
position
you
occupy
in
the
world
of
business
we
are
launching
a
campaign
against
the
extravagant
ridiculous
and
oftentimes
indecent
dress
of
the
working
girl
with
especial
reference
to
the
girl
who
works
in
garment
factories
they
squander
their
earnings
in
costumes
absurdly
unfitted
to
their
station
in
life
our
plan
is
to
influence
them
in
the
direction
of
neatness
modesty
and
economy
in
dress
at
present
each
tries
to
outdo
the
other
in
style
and
variety
of
costume
their
shoes
are
their
blouses
lacy
and
collarless
their
hats
absurd
we
propose
a
costume
which
shall
be
neat
becoming
and
appropriate
not
exactly
a
uniform
perhaps
but
something
with
a
fixed
idea
in
cut
color
and
style
a
corps
of
twelve
young
ladies
belonging
to
our
best
families
has
been
chosen
to
speak
to
the
shop
girls
at
noon
meetings
on
the
subject
of
good
taste
health
and
morality
in
women
dress
my
daughter
gladys
is
one
of
them
in
this
way
we
hope
to
convince
them
that
simplicity
and
practicality
and
neatness
are
the
only
proper
notes
in
the
costume
of
the
working
girl
occupying
as
you
do
a
position
unique
in
the
business
world
buck
we
expect
much
from
your
cooperation
with
us
in
this
cause
emma
mcchesney
buck
had
been
gazing
at
with
an
intentness
as
flattering
as
it
was
unfeigned
but
at
the
close
of
speech
she
was
strangely
silent
she
glanced
down
at
her
shoes
now
emma
mcchesney
buck
had
a
weakness
for
smart
shoes
which
her
slim
foot
excused
hers
were
what
might
be
called
feet
there
was
nothing
thick
nothing
clumsy
nothing
awkward
about
them
and
emma
treated
them
with
the
consideration
they
deserved
they
were
shod
now
in
a
pair
of
slim
aristocratic
and
modish
ties
above
which
the
grateful
eye
caught
a
flashing
glimpse
of
stocking
then
her
eye
traveled
up
her
smartly
tailored
skirt
up
the
bodice
of
that
and
becoming
costume
until
her
glance
rested
on
her
own
shoulder
and
paused
then
she
looked
up
at
the
eyes
of
miss
susan
croft
and
miss
gladys
had
by
some
strange
power
of
magnetism
followed
the
path
of
emma
eyes
they
finished
just
one
second
behind
her
so
that
when
she
raised
her
eyes
it
was
to
encounter
theirs
i
have
explained
retorted
tartly
in
reply
to
nothing
seemingly
that
our
problem
is
with
the
factory
girl
she
represents
a
distinct
and
separate
class
emma
mcchesney
buck
nodded
i
understand
our
girls
are
very
young
eighteen
twenty
at
eighteen
or
thereabouts
practical
garments
have
the
strong
appeal
that
you
might
think
they
have
they
should
have
insisted
maybe
said
emma
buck
gently
but
to
me
it
seems
just
as
reasonable
to
argue
that
an
apple
tree
has
no
right
to
wear
blossoms
in
the
spring
so
long
as
it
is
going
to
bear
sober
russets
in
the
autumn
miss
susan
croft
rustled
indignantly
then
you
refuse
to
work
with
us
you
will
not
consent
to
miss
speaking
to
the
girls
in
your
shop
this
noon
emma
looked
at
gladys
gladys
was
wearing
black
and
black
did
not
become
her
it
made
her
creamy
skin
sallow
her
suit
was
severely
tailored
and
her
hat
was
small
and
harshly
outlined
and
her
hair
was
drawn
back
from
her
face
all
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
miss
was
of
the
limp
and
fragile
type
which
demands
ruffles
fluffiness
flowing
lines
and
emma
glance
at
the
suppressed
gladys
was
as
fleeting
as
it
was
keen
but
it
sufficed
to
bring
her
to
a
decision
she
pressed
a
buzzer
at
her
desk
i
shall
be
happy
to
have
miss
speak
to
the
girls
in
our
shop
this
noon
and
as
often
as
she
cares
to
speak
if
she
can
convince
the
girls
that
a
er
fixed
idea
in
cut
color
and
style
is
the
thing
to
be
adopted
by
i
am
perfectly
willing
that
they
be
convinced
then
to
annie
who
appeared
in
answer
to
the
buzzer
will
you
tell
sophy
kumpf
to
come
here
please
beamed
the
somber
plumes
in
her
correct
hat
bobbed
and
dipped
to
emma
the
austere
miss
susan
croft
unbent
in
a
nutcracker
smile
only
miss
gladys
remained
silent
thoughtful
unenthusiastic
her
eyes
were
on
emma
face
a
heavy
comfortable
step
sounded
in
the
hall
outside
the
office
door
emma
turned
with
a
smile
to
the
stout
motherly
woman
who
entered
smoothing
her
coarse
brown
hair
with
fingers
emma
took
one
of
those
calloused
hands
in
hers
sophy
we
need
your
advice
this
is
sophy
kumpf
miss
susan
croft
sophy
threw
her
a
keen
glance
she
knew
that
name
and
miss
of
the
four
sophy
was
the
most
at
ease
pleased
to
meet
you
said
sophy
kumpf
the
three
bowed
but
did
not
commit
themselves
emma
her
hand
still
on
sophy
elaborated
sophy
kumpf
has
been
with
the
buck
company
for
thirty
years
she
could
run
this
business
if
she
had
to
she
knows
any
machine
in
the
shop
can
cut
a
pattern
keep
books
run
the
entire
plant
if
necessary
if
there
anything
about
petticoats
that
sophy
does
know
it
because
it
has
been
invented
yet
sophy
was
sixteen
when
she
came
to
buck
i
heard
she
was
the
prettiest
and
best
dressed
girl
in
the
shop
oh
now
mrs
buck
remonstrated
sophy
emma
tried
to
frown
as
she
surveyed
sophy
bright
eyes
her
rosy
cheeks
her
broad
bosom
her
ample
hips
all
that
made
sophy
an
object
to
comfort
and
rest
the
eye
do
dispute
sophy
sophy
has
educated
her
children
married
them
off
and
welcomed
their
children
she
thinks
that
excuses
her
for
having
been
frivolous
and
extravagant
at
sixteen
but
we
know
better
do
we
i
using
you
as
a
horrible
example
sophy
sophy
turned
affably
to
the
listening
three
do
let
her
string
you
she
said
and
winked
one
knowing
eye
stiffened
miss
susan
croft
congealed
but
miss
gladys
smiled
and
then
emma
knew
she
was
right
sophy
who
the
prettiest
girl
in
our
shop
and
the
best
dressed
lily
bernstein
sophy
made
prompt
answer
send
her
in
to
us
will
you
and
give
her
credit
for
lost
time
when
she
comes
back
to
the
shop
sophy
with
a
last
beamingly
smile
withdrew
five
minutes
later
when
lily
bernstein
entered
the
office
sophy
qualified
as
a
judge
of
beauty
lily
bernstein
was
a
all
browns
and
golds
and
creams
all
graciousness
and
warmth
and
lovely
curves
as
she
came
into
the
room
gladys
seemed
as
bloodless
and
pale
and
ineffectual
as
a
white
moth
beside
a
gorgeous
tawny
butterfly
emma
presented
the
girl
as
formally
as
she
had
sophy
kumpf
and
lily
bernstein
smiled
upon
them
and
her
teeth
were
as
white
and
even
as
one
knew
they
would
be
before
she
smiled
lily
had
taken
off
her
her
gown
was
blue
serge
cheap
in
quality
flawless
as
to
cut
and
fit
and
incredibly
becoming
above
it
her
vivid
face
glowed
like
a
golden
rose
lily
said
emma
miss
is
going
to
speak
to
the
girls
this
noon
i
thought
you
might
help
by
telling
her
whatever
she
wants
to
know
about
the
girls
work
and
all
that
and
by
making
her
feel
at
home
well
sure
said
lily
and
smiled
again
her
smile
i
love
to
miss
went
on
emma
smoothly
wants
to
speak
to
the
girls
about
clothes
lily
looked
again
at
miss
and
she
did
not
mean
to
be
cruel
then
she
looked
quickly
at
emma
to
detect
a
possible
joke
but
buck
face
bore
no
trace
of
a
smile
clothes
repeated
lily
and
a
slow
red
mounted
to
gladys
pale
face
when
lily
went
out
sunday
afternoons
she
might
have
passed
for
a
millionaire
daughter
if
she
had
been
so
well
dressed
suppose
you
take
miss
into
the
shop
suggested
emma
so
that
she
may
have
some
idea
of
the
size
and
character
of
our
family
before
she
speaks
to
it
how
long
shall
you
want
to
speak
miss
started
nervously
stammered
a
little
stopped
oh
ten
minutes
said
graciously
five
said
gladys
quickly
and
followed
lily
bernstein
into
the
workroom
and
miss
susan
croft
gazed
after
them
rather
attractive
that
girl
in
a
coarse
way
mused
if
only
we
can
teach
them
to
avoid
the
cheap
and
tawdry
if
only
we
can
train
them
to
appreciate
the
finer
things
in
life
of
course
their
life
is
peculiar
their
problems
are
not
our
problems
their
their
problems
are
just
exactly
our
problems
interrupted
emma
crisply
they
use
garlic
instead
of
onion
and
they
do
bathe
as
often
as
we
do
but
then
perhaps
we
would
either
if
we
tubs
and
showers
so
handy
in
the
shop
queer
things
were
happening
to
gladys
at
her
entrance
into
the
big
workroom
one
hundred
pairs
of
eyes
had
lifted
dropped
and
in
that
one
look
condemned
her
hat
suit
blouse
veil
and
tout
ensemble
when
you
are
on
you
squander
very
little
time
gazing
at
uplift
visitors
in
the
wrong
kind
of
clothes
gladys
looked
about
the
big
bright
workroom
the
noonday
sun
streamed
in
from
a
dozen
great
windows
there
seemed
somehow
to
be
a
look
of
content
and
capableness
about
those
heads
bent
so
busily
over
the
stitching
it
looks
pleasant
said
gladys
it
ai
bad
of
course
it
hard
sitting
all
day
but
i
rather
do
that
than
stand
from
eight
to
six
behind
a
counter
and
there
good
money
in
it
gladys
turned
wistful
eyes
on
friendly
little
lily
bernstein
i
like
to
earn
money
she
said
i
like
to
work
well
why
do
you
demanded
lily
work
all
the
style
this
year
they
all
doing
it
look
at
the
vanderbilts
and
that
morgan
girl
and
the
whole
crowd
these
days
you
ca
tell
whether
the
girl
at
the
machine
next
to
you
lives
in
the
bronx
or
on
fifth
avenue
it
must
be
wonderful
to
earn
your
own
clothes
believe
me
laughed
lily
bernstein
it
ai
so
wonderful
when
you
had
to
do
it
all
your
life
she
studied
the
pale
girl
before
her
with
brows
thoughtfully
knit
lily
had
met
too
many
uplifters
to
be
in
awe
of
them
besides
a
certain
friendliness
was
hers
for
every
one
she
met
so
like
the
child
she
was
she
spoke
what
was
in
her
mind
say
listen
dearie
i
would
wear
black
if
i
was
you
and
that
plain
stuff
it
do
suit
you
i
like
that
too
there
some
things
i
can
wear
and
others
i
look
fierce
in
i
like
you
in
one
of
them
big
flat
hats
and
a
full
skirt
like
you
see
in
the
ads
with
lots
of
ribbons
and
tag
ends
and
bows
on
it
know
what
i
mean
my
mother
was
a
van
cleve
said
gladys
drearily
as
though
that
explained
everything
so
it
might
have
to
any
but
a
lily
bernstein
lily
did
know
what
a
van
cleve
was
but
she
sensed
it
as
a
drawback
do
you
care
everybody
folks
have
got
something
the
matter
with
especially
when
you
a
girl
but
if
i
was
you
i
go
right
ahead
and
do
what
i
wanted
to
in
the
doorway
at
the
far
end
of
the
shop
appeared
emma
with
her
two
visitors
stopped
and
said
something
to
a
girl
at
a
machine
and
her
very
posture
and
smile
reeked
of
an
offensive
kindliness
a
condescending
patronage
gladys
did
a
strange
thing
she
saw
her
mother
coming
toward
her
she
put
one
hand
on
lily
bernstein
arm
and
she
spoke
hurriedly
and
in
a
little
gasping
voice
listen
would
you
would
you
marry
a
man
who
had
any
money
to
speak
of
and
no
sort
of
family
if
you
loved
him
even
if
your
mother
would
would
would
i
say
you
go
out
morning
and
buy
yourself
one
of
them
floppy
hats
and
a
lace
waist
over
chiffon
and
get
married
in
it
do
get
it
white
with
your
coloring
get
it
kind
of
cream
you
so
grand
and
thin
this
year
things
will
look
lovely
on
you
a
bell
shrilled
somewhere
in
the
shop
a
hundred
machines
stopped
their
whirring
a
hundred
heads
came
up
with
a
sigh
of
relief
chairs
were
pushed
back
aprons
unbuttoned
emma
mcchesney
buck
stepped
forward
and
raised
a
hand
for
attention
the
noise
of
a
hundred
tongues
was
stilled
girls
miss
gladys
is
going
to
speak
to
you
for
five
minutes
on
the
subject
of
dress
will
you
give
her
your
attention
please
the
five
minutes
will
be
added
to
your
noon
hour
gladys
looked
down
at
her
hands
for
one
terrified
moment
then
she
threw
her
head
up
bravely
there
was
no
lack
of
color
in
her
cheeks
now
she
stepped
to
the
middle
of
the
room
what
i
have
to
say
wo
take
five
minutes
she
said
in
her
clear
tones
you
all
dress
so
smartly
and
i
such
a
dowd
i
just
want
to
ask
you
whether
you
think
i
ought
to
get
blue
or
that
new
shade
of
gray
for
a
and
the
shop
hardened
to
the
eccentricities
of
noonday
speakers
made
composed
and
ready
answer
oh
get
blue
it
always
good
thank
you
laughed
gladys
and
was
off
down
the
hall
and
away
with
never
a
backward
glance
at
her
gasping
and
outraged
mother
emma
mcchesney
buck
took
lily
bernstein
soft
cheek
between
thumb
and
forefinger
and
pinched
it
ever
so
fondly
i
knew
you
do
it
judy
she
said
judy
a
lady
famous
in
history
oh
now
quit
your
kiddin
mrs
buck
said
lily
bernstein
vii
an
etude
for
emma
if
you
listen
long
enough
and
earnestly
enough
and
with
ear
sufficiently
attuned
to
the
music
of
this
sphere
there
will
come
to
you
this
reward
the
violins
and
oboes
and
and
brasses
of
humanity
which
seemed
all
at
variance
with
each
other
will
unite
as
one
instrument
seeming
discords
and
dissonances
will
blend
into
harmony
and
the
wail
and
blare
and
thrum
of
humanity
orchestra
will
sound
in
your
ear
the
sublime
melody
of
that
great
symphony
called
life
in
her
sunny
little
private
office
on
the
twelfth
floor
of
the
great
that
housed
the
buck
company
emma
mcchesney
buck
sat
listening
to
the
that
were
wafted
to
her
mellowed
by
height
and
distance
the
noises
taken
separately
were
the
sounds
common
to
a
busy
new
york
by
the
time
they
reached
the
little
office
on
the
twelfth
floor
they
were
softened
mellowed
debrutalized
welded
into
a
weird
choirlike
chant
first
high
then
low
rising
swelling
dying
away
rising
again
to
a
dull
roar
with
now
and
then
vast
undertones
like
the
rumbling
of
a
cathedral
emma
knew
that
the
high
clear
tenor
note
was
the
shrill
cry
of
the
lame
newsie
at
the
corner
of
sixth
avenue
and
street
those
deep
thunderous
bass
notes
were
the
combined
reverberation
of
nearby
l
trains
distant
subway
and
clanging
surface
cars
that
sharp
staccato
was
a
motorman
clanging
his
bell
of
warning
these
things
she
knew
but
she
liked
nevertheless
to
shut
her
eyes
for
a
moment
in
the
midst
of
her
busy
day
and
listen
to
the
chant
of
the
city
as
it
came
up
to
her
subdued
softened
strangely
beautified
the
sound
saddened
even
while
it
filled
her
with
a
certain
exaltation
we
have
no
one
word
for
that
sensation
the
german
there
a
language
has
it
weltschmerz
as
distance
softened
the
harsh
sounds
to
her
ears
so
time
and
experience
had
given
her
a
perspective
on
life
itself
she
saw
it
not
as
a
series
of
incidents
pleasant
and
unpleasant
but
as
a
great
universal
scheme
too
mighty
to
comprehend
a
scheme
that
always
worked
itself
out
in
some
miraculous
way
she
had
had
a
singularly
full
life
had
emma
mcchesney
buck
a
life
replete
with
work
leavened
by
sorrows
sweetened
with
happiness
these
ingredients
make
for
tolerance
she
saw
for
example
how
the
capable
modern
staff
in
the
main
business
office
had
forged
ahead
of
old
pop
henderson
pop
henderson
had
been
head
bookkeeper
for
years
but
the
pen
in
his
trembling
hand
made
queer
spidery
marks
in
the
ledgers
now
and
his
figure
seven
was
very
likely
to
look
like
a
drunken
letter
z
the
great
bulk
of
his
work
was
done
by
the
capable
comely
miss
kelly
who
could
juggle
figures
like
a
cinquevalli
his
shaking
yellow
hand
was
no
match
for
miss
cool
firm
fingers
but
he
stayed
on
at
buck
and
no
one
dreamed
of
insulting
him
with
talk
of
a
pension
least
of
all
emma
she
saw
the
pathetic
old
man
not
only
as
a
figure
but
as
a
symbol
jock
mcchesney
very
young
very
handsome
very
successful
coming
on
to
new
york
from
chicago
to
be
married
in
june
found
his
mother
wrapped
in
this
contemplative
calm
now
emma
mcchesney
buck
mother
of
an
son
was
also
surprisingly
young
and
astonishingly
handsome
and
highly
successful
jock
in
a
lucid
moment
the
day
before
his
wedding
took
occasion
to
comment
rather
resentfully
on
his
mother
attitude
it
seems
to
me
he
said
gloomily
that
for
a
mother
whose
only
son
is
about
to
be
handed
over
to
what
the
writers
call
the
other
woman
you
pretty
resigned
not
to
say
cheerful
emma
glanced
up
at
him
as
he
stood
there
so
tall
and
straight
and
altogether
good
to
look
at
and
the
glow
of
love
and
pride
in
her
eyes
belied
the
lightness
of
her
words
i
know
it
she
said
with
mock
seriousness
and
it
worries
me
i
ca
imagine
why
i
fail
to
feel
those
pangs
that
mothers
are
supposed
to
suffer
at
this
time
i
ought
to
rend
my
garments
and
beat
my
breast
but
i
ca
help
thinking
of
what
a
stunning
girl
grace
galt
is
and
what
a
brain
she
has
and
how
lucky
you
are
to
get
her
any
girl
with
the
future
that
girl
had
in
the
advertising
field
give
up
four
thousand
a
year
and
her
independence
to
marry
a
man
does
it
for
love
let
me
tell
you
if
anybody
knows
you
better
than
your
mother
son
i
hate
to
know
who
it
is
and
if
anybody
loves
you
more
than
your
mother
well
we
need
go
into
that
because
it
would
have
to
be
hypothetical
anyway
you
see
jock
i
loved
you
so
long
and
so
well
that
i
know
your
faults
as
well
as
your
virtues
and
i
love
you
not
in
spite
of
them
but
because
of
them
oh
i
do
know
interrupted
jock
with
some
warmth
i
not
perfect
but
a
fellow
perfect
jock
mcchesney
when
i
think
of
grace
feelings
when
she
discovers
that
you
never
close
a
closet
door
when
i
contemplate
her
emotions
on
hearing
your
howl
at
finding
one
seed
in
your
orange
juice
at
breakfast
when
she
learns
of
your
secret
and
unholy
passion
for
neckties
that
have
a
dash
of
red
in
and
how
you
have
to
be
restrained
by
force
from
with
a
simulated
roar
of
rage
jock
mcchesney
fell
upon
his
mother
with
a
series
of
that
left
her
flushed
panting
limp
but
it
was
to
her
husband
that
emma
revealed
the
real
source
of
her
spartan
calm
the
wedding
was
over
there
had
been
a
quiet
little
celebration
after
which
jock
mcchesney
had
gone
west
with
his
very
lovely
young
wife
emma
had
kissed
her
very
tenderly
very
soberly
after
the
brief
ceremony
mcchesney
she
had
said
and
her
voice
shook
ever
so
little
jock
mcchesney
and
the
new
mcchesney
a
most
astonishingly
intuitive
young
woman
indeed
had
understood
buck
being
a
man
puzzled
over
it
a
little
that
night
when
emma
had
reached
the
kimono
and
stage
he
ventured
to
speak
his
wonderment
know
emma
you
were
about
the
calmest
and
most
serene
mother
that
i
ever
did
see
at
a
son
wedding
of
course
i
did
expect
you
to
have
hysterics
or
anything
like
that
i
always
said
that
when
it
came
to
repose
and
you
could
make
the
german
empress
look
like
a
hoyden
but
i
always
thought
that
at
such
times
a
mother
viewed
her
new
as
a
rival
that
the
very
sight
of
her
filled
her
with
a
jealous
rage
like
that
of
a
tigress
whose
cub
is
taken
from
her
i
must
say
you
were
so
smiling
and
urbane
that
i
thought
it
was
almost
uncomplimentary
to
the
young
couple
you
even
weep
you
unnatural
woman
emma
seated
before
her
stopped
brushing
her
hair
and
sat
silent
a
moment
looking
down
with
unseeing
eyes
at
the
brush
in
her
hand
i
know
it
a
would
you
like
to
have
me
tell
you
why
he
came
over
to
her
then
and
ran
a
tender
hand
down
the
length
of
her
bright
hair
then
he
kissed
the
top
of
her
head
this
satisfactory
performance
he
capped
by
saying
i
think
i
know
why
it
because
the
minister
hesitated
a
minute
and
looked
from
you
to
grace
and
back
again
not
knowing
which
was
the
bride
the
way
you
looked
in
that
dress
emma
was
enough
to
reconcile
any
woman
to
losing
her
entire
family
you
do
say
the
nicest
things
to
me
like
emma
like
you
know
perfectly
well
that
you
never
can
offend
me
by
making
me
compliments
like
that
i
not
only
like
them
i
actually
believe
them
that
because
i
mean
them
emma
now
out
with
that
reason
emma
stood
up
then
and
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
but
she
was
not
looking
at
him
she
was
gazing
past
him
her
eyes
dreamy
contemplative
i
do
know
whether
i
be
able
to
explain
to
you
just
how
i
feel
about
it
i
probably
make
a
mess
of
it
but
i
try
you
see
dear
it
just
this
way
two
years
ago
a
year
ago
even
i
might
have
felt
just
that
sensation
of
personal
resentment
and
loss
but
somehow
lately
i
been
looking
at
life
through
how
shall
i
put
it
through
glasses
i
used
to
see
life
in
its
relation
to
me
and
mine
now
i
see
it
in
terms
of
my
relation
to
it
do
you
get
me
i
was
the
soloist
and
the
world
my
orchestral
accompaniment
lately
i
been
content
just
to
step
back
with
the
other
instruments
and
let
my
little
share
go
to
make
up
a
more
perfect
whole
in
those
years
long
before
i
met
you
when
jock
was
all
i
had
in
the
world
i
worked
and
fought
and
saved
that
he
might
have
the
proper
start
the
proper
training
and
environment
and
i
did
succeed
in
giving
him
those
things
well
as
i
looked
at
him
there
i
saw
him
not
as
my
son
my
property
that
was
going
out
of
my
control
into
the
hands
of
another
woman
but
as
a
link
in
the
great
chain
that
i
had
helped
to
forge
a
link
as
strong
and
sound
and
perfect
as
i
could
make
it
i
saw
him
not
as
my
boy
jock
mcchesney
but
as
a
unit
when
i
am
gone
i
shall
still
live
in
him
and
he
in
turn
will
live
in
his
children
there
i
muddled
it
have
i
as
i
said
i
would
but
i
think
and
she
looked
into
her
husband
glowing
no
i
sure
you
understand
and
when
i
die
t
you
emma
and
he
held
her
close
and
then
held
her
off
to
look
at
her
through
quizzical
appreciative
eyes
why
girl
i
ca
imagine
you
doing
anything
so
passive
in
the
busy
year
that
followed
anyone
watching
emma
mcchesney
buck
as
she
worked
and
played
and
constructed
and
helped
others
to
work
and
play
and
construct
would
have
agreed
with
buck
she
did
not
seem
a
woman
who
was
looking
at
life
objectively
as
she
went
about
her
home
in
the
evening
or
the
office
the
workroom
or
the
showrooms
during
the
day
adjusting
this
arranging
that
smoothing
out
snarls
solving
problems
of
business
or
household
she
was
very
much
alive
very
vital
very
personal
very
electric
in
that
year
there
came
to
her
many
letters
from
jock
and
grace
happy
letters
all
of
them
some
with
an
undertone
of
great
seriousness
as
is
fitting
when
two
people
are
readjusting
their
lives
then
in
spring
came
the
news
of
the
baby
the
telegram
came
to
emma
as
she
sat
in
her
office
near
the
close
of
a
busy
day
as
she
read
it
and
reread
it
the
slip
of
paper
became
a
misty
yellow
with
vague
lines
of
blue
dancing
about
on
it
then
it
became
a
blur
of
nothing
in
particular
as
emma
tears
fell
on
it
in
a
little
shower
of
joy
and
pride
and
wonder
at
the
eternal
miracle
then
she
dried
her
eyes
mopped
the
telegram
and
her
lace
jabot
impartially
went
across
the
hall
and
opened
the
door
marked
a
buck
looked
up
from
his
desk
smiled
held
out
a
hand
girl
or
boy
girl
of
course
said
emma
tremulously
and
her
name
is
emma
mcchesney
stood
up
and
put
an
arm
about
his
wife
shoulders
lean
on
me
grandma
he
said
fiend
retorted
emma
and
reread
the
telegram
happily
she
folded
it
then
with
a
pensive
sigh
i
hope
she
look
like
grace
but
with
jock
eyes
they
were
wasted
in
a
man
at
any
rate
she
ought
to
be
a
raving
tearing
beauty
with
that
father
and
mother
what
about
her
grandmother
when
it
comes
to
looks
yes
and
think
of
the
brain
she
have
buck
reminded
her
excitedly
great
scott
with
a
grandmother
who
has
made
the
buck
featherloom
petticoat
a
household
word
and
a
mother
who
was
the
cleverest
woman
advertising
in
new
york
this
young
lady
ought
to
be
a
composite
hetty
green
madame
de
stael
hypatia
and
emma
mcchesney
buck
she
be
a
lady
wizard
of
finance
or
a
she
be
nothing
of
the
kind
emma
disputed
calmly
that
child
will
be
a
throwback
the
third
generation
generally
is
with
a
militant
mother
and
a
grandmother
such
as
that
child
has
she
just
naturally
be
a
clinging
vine
she
be
a
reversion
to
type
be
the
kind
who
make
eyes
and
wear
pale
blue
and
be
crazy
about
new
just
mark
my
words
t
a
buck
had
a
brilliant
idea
why
do
you
pack
a
bag
and
run
over
to
chicago
for
a
few
days
and
see
this
marvel
of
the
age
but
emma
shook
her
head
not
now
a
later
let
the
delicate
machinery
of
that
new
household
adjust
itself
and
begin
to
run
smoothly
and
sweetly
again
anyone
who
might
come
in
now
even
jock
mother
would
be
only
an
outsider
so
she
waited
very
patiently
and
considerately
there
was
much
to
occupy
her
mind
that
spring
business
was
unexpectedly
and
gratifyingly
good
then
too
one
of
their
pet
dreams
was
being
realized
they
were
to
have
their
own
house
in
the
country
at
westchester
together
they
had
pored
over
the
plans
it
was
to
be
a
house
of
wide
spacious
verandas
of
fireplaces
of
bookshelves
of
great
bright
windows
and
white
enamel
and
cheerful
chintz
by
the
end
of
may
it
was
finished
furnished
and
complete
at
which
a
surprising
thing
happened
and
yet
not
so
surprising
a
demon
of
restlessness
seized
emma
mcchesney
buck
it
had
been
a
busy
happy
winter
filled
with
work
now
that
it
was
finished
there
came
upon
emma
and
buck
that
unconscious
and
quite
natural
irritation
which
follows
a
long
winter
spent
together
by
two
people
no
matter
how
much
in
harmony
emma
pulled
herself
up
now
and
then
horrified
to
find
a
rasping
note
of
impatience
in
her
voice
buck
found
himself
once
or
twice
fairly
caught
in
a
little
whirlpool
of
ill
temper
of
his
own
making
these
conditions
they
discovered
almost
simultaneously
and
like
the
comrades
they
were
they
talked
it
over
and
came
to
a
sensible
understanding
we
a
bit
ragged
and
said
emma
we
getting
on
each
other
nerves
what
we
need
is
a
vacation
from
each
other
this
morning
i
found
myself
on
the
verge
of
snapping
at
you
at
you
imagine
t
whereupon
buck
came
forward
with
his
confession
it
a
couple
of
late
cases
of
spring
fever
you
been
tied
to
this
office
all
winter
so
i
we
need
a
change
you
had
too
much
petticoats
too
much
husband
too
much
cutting
room
and
and
rush
orders
and
business
generally
too
much
featherloom
and
not
enough
foolishness
he
came
over
and
put
a
gentle
hand
on
his
shoulder
a
thing
strictly
against
the
rules
during
business
hours
and
emma
not
only
permitted
it
but
reached
over
and
covered
his
hand
with
her
own
you
tired
and
you
a
wee
bit
nervous
so
said
ever
so
gently
and
kissed
his
wife
get
out
of
here
and
emma
got
she
went
not
to
the
mountains
or
the
seashore
but
with
her
face
to
the
west
in
her
trunks
were
tiny
garments
garments
things
embroidered
and
scalloped
and
hemstitched
and
and
lacy
she
went
looking
less
grandmotherly
than
ever
in
her
smart
blue
tailor
suit
her
rakish
hat
her
quietly
correct
gloves
and
slim
shoes
and
softly
becoming
jabot
her
husband
had
got
her
a
compartment
had
laden
her
down
with
books
magazines
fruit
flowers
candy
five
minutes
before
the
train
pulled
out
emma
looked
about
the
little
room
and
sighed
even
while
she
smiled
you
an
extravagant
boy
i
look
as
if
i
were
equipped
for
a
dash
to
the
pole
instead
of
an
run
to
chicago
but
i
love
you
for
it
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
confess
how
i
like
having
a
whole
compartment
just
for
myself
you
see
a
compartment
always
will
spell
luxury
to
me
there
were
all
those
years
on
the
road
you
know
when
i
often
considered
myself
in
luck
to
get
an
upper
on
a
local
of
a
branch
line
that
threw
you
around
in
your
berth
like
a
bean
in
a
tin
can
every
time
the
engineer
stopped
or
started
buck
looked
at
his
watch
then
stooped
in
farewell
quite
suddenly
they
did
not
want
to
part
they
had
grown
curiously
used
to
each
other
these
two
emma
found
herself
clinging
to
this
man
with
the
tender
eyes
and
buck
held
her
close
regardless
of
emma
rushed
him
to
the
platform
and
watched
him
as
he
swung
off
the
slowly
moving
train
come
on
along
she
called
almost
tearfully
buck
looked
up
at
her
at
her
trim
erect
figure
at
her
clear
youthful
coloring
at
the
brightness
of
her
eye
if
you
want
to
get
a
reputation
for
comedy
he
laughed
tell
somebody
on
that
train
that
you
going
to
visit
your
granddaughter
jock
met
her
at
the
station
in
chicago
and
drove
her
home
in
a
very
dapper
and
glittering
black
runabout
grace
wanted
to
come
down
he
explained
as
they
sped
along
but
they
changing
the
baby
food
or
something
and
she
did
want
to
leave
you
know
those
nurses
emma
felt
a
curious
little
pang
this
was
her
boy
her
baby
talking
about
his
baby
and
nurses
she
had
a
sense
of
unreality
he
turned
to
her
with
shining
eyes
that
a
stunning
blonde
honestly
you
a
wiz
mother
grace
has
told
all
her
friends
that
you
coming
and
their
mothers
are
going
to
call
but
good
lord
you
look
like
my
younger
sister
on
the
square
you
do
the
apartment
reached
it
seemed
to
emma
that
she
floated
across
the
walk
and
up
the
stairs
so
eagerly
did
her
heart
cry
out
for
a
glimpse
of
this
little
being
who
was
flesh
of
her
flesh
grace
a
little
pale
but
more
beautiful
than
ever
met
them
at
the
door
her
arms
went
about
emma
neck
then
she
stood
her
handsome
off
and
gazed
at
her
you
wonder
how
lovely
you
look
good
heavens
are
they
wearing
that
kind
of
hat
in
new
york
and
those
collars
i
have
seen
a
thing
like
here
is
east
and
west
is
west
and
where
that
child
demanded
emma
mcchesney
buck
where
my
baby
came
in
a
sibilant
duet
from
grace
and
jock
not
now
she
sleeping
we
were
up
with
her
for
three
hours
last
night
it
was
the
new
food
she
not
used
to
it
yet
but
you
foolish
children
ca
i
peek
at
her
oh
dear
no
said
grace
hastily
we
never
go
into
her
room
when
she
asleep
this
is
your
room
mother
dear
and
just
as
soon
as
she
wakes
up
this
is
your
bath
you
want
to
freshen
up
dear
me
who
could
have
hung
the
baby
little
shirt
here
the
nurse
i
suppose
if
i
do
attend
to
every
little
thing
emma
took
off
her
hat
and
smoothed
her
hair
with
light
deft
fingers
she
turned
a
smiling
face
toward
jock
and
grace
standing
there
in
the
doorway
now
do
bother
dear
if
you
knew
how
i
love
having
that
little
shirt
to
look
at
and
i
such
things
in
my
trunk
wait
till
you
see
them
so
she
possessed
her
soul
in
patience
for
one
hour
two
hours
at
the
end
of
the
second
hour
a
little
wail
went
up
grace
vanished
down
the
hall
emma
her
heart
beating
very
fast
followed
her
a
moment
later
she
was
bending
over
a
very
pink
morsel
with
very
blue
eyes
and
she
was
saying
over
and
over
in
a
rapture
of
delightful
idiocy
say
hello
to
your
yes
her
is
say
hello
granny
and
her
longing
arms
reached
down
to
take
up
her
namesake
not
now
grace
said
hastily
we
never
play
with
her
just
before
we
find
that
it
excites
her
and
that
bad
for
her
digestion
dear
me
marveled
emma
i
do
remember
worrying
about
digestion
when
he
was
two
and
a
half
months
old
it
was
thus
that
emma
mcchesney
buck
for
many
years
accustomed
to
leadership
learned
to
follow
humbly
and
in
silence
she
had
always
been
the
orbit
about
which
her
world
revolved
years
of
brilliant
success
of
triumphant
execution
had
not
spoiled
her
or
made
her
offensively
dictatorial
but
they
had
taught
her
a
certain
had
accustomed
her
to
a
degree
of
deference
from
others
now
she
was
the
humblest
of
the
satellites
revolving
about
this
sun
of
the
household
she
learned
to
tiptoe
when
small
emma
mcchesney
was
sleeping
she
learned
that
the
modern
mother
does
not
approve
of
the
holding
of
a
child
in
one
arms
no
matter
how
those
arms
might
be
aching
to
feel
the
frail
weight
of
the
soft
sweet
body
she
who
had
brought
a
child
into
the
world
who
had
had
to
train
that
child
alone
had
raised
him
had
educated
him
denied
herself
for
him
made
a
man
of
him
now
found
herself
all
ignorant
of
twentieth
century
methods
she
learned
strange
things
about
and
formulae
and
units
and
olive
oil
and
orange
juice
and
ounces
and
farina
and
and
striped
nurses
who
view
grandmothers
with
a
coldly
disapproving
and
pitying
eye
she
watched
the
for
the
first
time
with
wonder
as
frank
as
it
was
unfeigned
and
i
thought
i
was
a
modern
woman
she
marveled
when
i
used
to
bathe
jock
i
tested
the
temperature
of
the
water
with
my
elbow
and
i
know
my
mother
used
to
test
my
when
i
was
a
baby
by
putting
me
into
it
she
used
to
say
that
if
i
turned
blue
she
knew
the
water
was
too
cold
and
if
i
turned
red
she
knew
it
was
too
hot
humph
snorted
the
striped
nurse
and
rightly
oh
i
do
say
that
your
method
is
the
proper
one
emma
hastened
to
say
humbly
and
watched
grace
scrutinize
the
with
critical
eye
in
the
days
that
followed
there
came
calling
the
mothers
of
friends
as
jock
had
predicted
charming
elderly
women
most
of
them
all
of
them
gracious
and
friendly
with
that
generous
friendliness
which
is
of
the
west
but
each
fell
into
one
of
two
classes
the
placid
rather
vague
woman
of
middle
age
whose
face
has
the
blank
look
of
the
sheltered
woman
and
who
wrinkles
early
from
sheer
lack
of
sufficient
activity
or
vital
interest
in
life
and
the
wiry
assertive
type
who
talked
about
her
club
work
and
her
charities
her
voice
always
taking
the
rising
inflection
at
the
end
of
a
sentence
as
though
addressing
a
meeting
when
they
met
emma
it
was
always
with
a
little
startled
look
of
surprise
followed
by
something
that
bordered
on
disapproval
emma
the
keenly
observant
watching
them
felt
vaguely
uncomfortable
she
tried
to
be
politely
interested
in
what
they
had
to
say
but
she
found
her
thoughts
straying
a
thousand
miles
away
to
the
man
whom
she
loved
and
who
loved
her
to
the
big
busy
factory
with
its
humming
machinery
and
its
capable
office
staff
to
the
tasteful
comfortable
spacious
house
that
she
had
helped
to
plan
to
all
the
vital
absorbing
fascinating
and
constructive
interests
with
which
her
busy
new
york
life
was
filled
to
overflowing
so
she
looked
smilingly
at
the
plump
ladies
who
came
in
their
smart
black
with
the
softening
at
the
throat
and
they
looked
smiling
politely
too
at
this
slim
erect
woman
with
the
shining
golden
hair
and
the
firm
smooth
skin
and
the
alert
manner
and
in
their
eyes
was
that
distrust
which
lurks
in
the
eyes
of
a
woman
as
she
looks
at
another
woman
of
her
own
age
who
does
show
it
in
the
weeks
of
her
stay
emma
managed
little
by
little
to
take
the
place
of
second
mother
in
the
household
she
had
tact
and
finesse
and
cleverness
enough
even
for
that
herculean
feat
grace
pale
cheeks
and
last
year
wardrobe
made
her
firm
in
her
stand
grace
she
said
one
day
listen
to
me
i
want
you
to
get
some
clothes
a
lot
of
them
and
foolish
ones
all
of
them
babies
are
all
very
well
but
husbands
have
some
slight
right
to
consideration
the
clock
for
you
is
an
instrument
devised
to
cut
up
the
day
and
night
into
your
baby
and
i
want
you
to
get
some
floppy
hats
with
roses
on
and
dresses
with
ruffles
and
sashes
i
stay
home
and
guard
your
child
from
vandals
and
ogres
scat
her
stay
lengthened
to
four
weeks
five
weeks
six
she
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
roses
blooming
in
grace
cheeks
as
well
as
in
her
hats
she
learned
to
efface
her
own
personality
that
others
might
shine
who
had
a
better
right
and
she
lost
some
of
her
own
bright
color
a
measure
of
her
own
buoyancy
in
the
sixth
week
she
saw
in
her
mirror
something
that
caused
her
to
lean
forward
to
stare
for
one
intent
moment
then
to
shrink
back
a
little
sunburst
but
undeniable
was
etched
delicately
about
the
corners
of
her
eyes
fifteen
minutes
later
she
had
wired
new
york
thus
home
friday
do
you
still
love
me
emma
when
she
left
little
emma
mcchesney
was
sleeping
by
a
curious
coincidence
as
she
had
been
when
emma
arrived
so
that
she
could
not
have
the
satisfaction
of
a
last
pressure
of
the
lips
against
the
cheek
she
had
to
content
herself
with
listening
close
to
the
door
in
the
vain
hope
of
catching
a
last
sound
of
the
breathing
she
was
laden
with
fruits
and
flowers
and
magazines
on
her
departure
as
she
had
been
when
she
left
new
york
but
somehow
these
things
did
not
seem
to
interest
her
after
the
train
had
left
chicago
smoky
buildings
far
behind
she
sat
very
still
for
a
long
time
her
eyes
shut
she
told
herself
that
she
felt
and
looked
very
old
very
tired
very
unlike
the
emma
mcchesney
buck
who
had
left
new
york
a
few
weeks
before
then
she
thought
of
and
her
eyes
unclosed
and
she
smiled
by
the
time
the
train
had
reached
cleveland
the
little
lines
seemed
miraculously
to
have
disappeared
somehow
from
about
her
eyes
when
they
left
the
one
hundred
and
street
station
she
was
a
creature
transformed
and
when
the
train
rolled
into
the
great
shed
emma
was
herself
again
alert
vibrating
energy
there
was
no
searching
no
hesitation
her
eyes
met
his
and
his
eyes
found
hers
with
a
quite
natural
magnetism
oh
my
dear
my
dear
i
did
know
you
were
so
handsome
and
how
beautiful
new
york
is
tell
me
have
i
grown
old
have
i
bundled
her
into
a
taxi
and
gazed
at
her
in
some
alarm
you
old
what
put
that
nonsense
into
your
head
you
tired
dear
we
go
home
and
you
have
a
good
rest
and
a
quiet
evening
rest
echoed
emma
and
sat
up
very
straight
her
cheeks
pink
quiet
evening
buck
listen
to
me
i
had
nothing
but
rest
and
quiet
evenings
for
six
weeks
i
feel
a
million
years
old
one
more
day
of
being
a
grandmother
and
i
should
have
died
do
you
know
what
going
to
do
i
going
to
stop
at
fifth
avenue
this
minute
and
buy
a
hat
that
a
thousand
times
too
young
for
me
and
you
going
with
me
to
tell
me
that
it
is
and
then
you
take
me
somewhere
to
dinner
a
place
with
music
and
pink
shades
and
then
i
want
to
see
a
wicked
play
preferably
with
a
runway
through
the
center
aisle
for
the
chorus
and
then
i
want
to
go
somewhere
and
dance
get
that
dear
dance
tell
me
t
tell
me
the
truth
do
you
think
i
old
and
faded
and
wistful
and
grandmotherly
i
think
said
buck
that
you
the
most
beautiful
the
most
wonderful
the
most
adorable
woman
in
the
world
and
the
more
foolish
your
new
hat
is
and
the
later
we
dance
the
better
i
like
it
it
has
been
awful
without
you
emma
emma
closed
her
eyes
and
there
came
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
a
great
sigh
of
relief
and
comfort
and
gratification
oh
my
dear
it
all
very
well
to
drown
your
identity
in
the
music
of
the
orchestra
but
there
nothing
equal
to
the
satisfaction
that
you
get
in
solo
work
