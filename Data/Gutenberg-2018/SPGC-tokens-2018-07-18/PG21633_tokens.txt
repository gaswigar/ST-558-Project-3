prospecting
it
was
morning
high
and
clear
as
arizona
counts
weather
and
around
the
little
railroad
station
were
gathered
a
crowd
of
curious
onlookers
seven
indians
three
women
from
nearby
shacks
drawn
thither
by
the
sight
of
the
great
private
car
that
the
night
express
had
left
on
a
side
track
the
usual
number
of
loungers
a
swarm
of
children
besides
the
station
agent
who
had
come
out
to
watch
proceedings
all
the
morning
the
private
car
had
been
an
object
of
deep
interest
to
those
who
lived
within
sight
and
that
was
everybody
on
the
plateau
and
many
and
various
had
been
the
errands
and
excuses
to
go
to
the
station
that
perchance
the
occupants
of
that
car
might
be
seen
or
a
glimpse
of
the
interior
of
the
moving
palace
but
the
silken
curtains
had
remained
drawn
until
after
nine
within
the
last
half
hour
however
a
change
had
taken
place
in
the
silent
inscrutable
car
the
curtains
had
parted
here
and
there
revealing
dim
flitting
faces
a
table
spread
with
a
snowy
cloth
and
flowers
in
a
vase
wild
flowers
they
were
too
like
those
that
grew
all
along
the
track
just
weeds
strange
that
one
who
could
afford
a
private
car
cared
for
weeds
in
a
glass
on
their
but
then
perhaps
they
did
know
a
fat
cook
with
ebony
skin
and
white
linen
attire
had
appeared
on
the
rear
platform
beating
eggs
and
half
whistling
half
singing
be
my
little
baby
buzz
around
buzz
around
he
seemed
in
no
wise
affected
or
embarrassed
by
the
natives
who
gradually
encircled
the
end
of
the
car
and
the
audience
grew
they
could
dimly
see
the
table
where
the
inmates
of
the
car
were
dining
it
could
be
breakfast
at
that
hour
surely
they
heard
the
discussion
about
horses
going
on
amid
laughter
and
merry
conversation
and
they
gathered
that
the
car
was
to
remain
here
for
the
day
at
least
while
some
of
the
party
went
off
on
a
horseback
trip
it
was
nothing
very
unusual
of
course
such
things
occasionally
occurred
in
that
region
but
not
often
enough
to
lose
their
interest
besides
to
watch
the
tourists
who
chanced
to
stop
in
their
tiny
settlement
was
the
only
way
for
them
to
learn
the
fashions
not
that
all
the
watchers
stood
and
stared
around
the
car
no
indeed
they
made
their
headquarters
around
the
station
platform
from
whence
they
took
brief
and
comprehensive
excursions
down
to
the
freight
station
and
back
going
always
on
one
side
of
the
car
and
returning
by
way
of
the
other
even
the
station
agent
felt
the
importance
of
the
occasion
and
stood
around
with
all
the
of
an
usher
at
a
grand
wedding
considering
himself
master
of
ceremonies
sure
they
come
from
the
east
last
night
limited
dropped
going
down
to
prospect
some
mine
i
reckon
they
ordered
horses
an
a
outfit
and
shag
bunce
is
goin
with
he
got
a
letter
a
week
ago
tellin
what
they
wanted
of
him
yes
i
knowed
all
about
it
he
brung
the
letter
to
me
to
cipher
out
fer
him
you
know
shag
ai
no
great
at
readin
ef
he
is
the
best
judge
of
a
mine
anywheres
about
thus
the
station
agent
explained
in
low
thrilling
tones
and
even
the
indians
watched
and
grunted
their
interest
at
eleven
the
horses
arrived
four
besides
shag
and
the
rest
of
the
outfit
the
onlookers
regarded
shag
with
the
mournful
interest
due
to
the
undertaker
at
a
funeral
shag
felt
it
and
acted
accordingly
he
gave
short
gruff
orders
to
his
men
called
attention
to
straps
and
buckles
that
every
one
knew
were
in
as
perfect
order
as
they
could
be
criticized
the
horses
and
his
men
and
every
one
even
the
horses
bore
it
with
perfect
composure
they
were
all
showing
off
and
felt
the
importance
of
the
moment
presently
the
car
door
opened
and
radcliffe
came
out
on
the
platform
accompanied
by
his
son
a
handsome
reckless
looking
fellow
his
daughter
hazel
and
hamar
a
man
with
dark
hair
jaunty
black
moustache
and
handsome
black
eyes
in
the
background
stood
an
erect
elderly
woman
in
attire
and
with
a
severe
expression
radcliffe
elder
sister
who
was
taking
the
trip
with
them
expecting
to
remain
in
california
with
her
son
and
behind
her
hovered
hazel
maid
these
two
were
not
to
be
of
the
riding
party
it
appeared
there
was
a
pleasant
stir
while
the
horses
were
brought
forward
and
the
riders
were
mounting
the
spectators
remained
breathlessly
unconscious
of
anything
save
the
scene
being
enacted
before
them
their
eyes
lingered
with
special
interest
on
the
girl
of
the
party
miss
radcliffe
was
small
and
graceful
with
a
head
set
on
her
pretty
shoulders
like
a
flower
on
its
stem
moreover
she
was
fair
so
fair
that
she
almost
dazzled
the
eyes
of
the
men
and
women
accustomed
to
brown
cheeks
kissed
by
the
sun
and
wind
of
the
plain
there
was
a
pink
in
her
cheeks
to
enhance
the
whiteness
which
made
it
but
the
more
dazzling
she
had
masses
of
golden
hair
wreathed
round
her
dainty
head
in
a
bewilderment
of
waves
and
braids
she
had
great
dark
eyes
of
blue
set
off
by
long
curling
lashes
and
delicately
pencilled
dark
brows
which
gave
the
eyes
a
pansy
softness
and
made
you
feel
when
she
looked
at
you
that
she
meant
a
great
deal
more
by
the
look
than
you
had
at
first
suspected
they
were
wonderful
beautiful
eyes
and
the
little
company
of
idlers
at
the
station
were
promptly
bewitched
by
them
moreover
there
was
a
fantastic
little
dimple
in
her
right
cheek
that
flashed
into
view
at
the
same
time
with
the
gleam
of
pearly
teeth
when
she
smiled
she
certainly
was
a
picture
the
station
looked
its
fill
and
rejoiced
in
her
young
beauty
she
was
garbed
in
a
dark
green
riding
habit
the
same
that
she
wore
when
she
rode
attended
by
her
groom
in
central
park
it
made
a
sensation
among
the
onlookers
as
did
the
little
riding
cap
of
dark
green
velvet
and
the
pretty
riding
gloves
she
sat
her
pony
well
daintily
as
though
she
had
alighted
briefly
but
to
their
eyes
strangely
and
not
as
the
women
out
there
rode
on
the
whole
the
station
saw
little
else
but
the
girl
all
the
others
were
mere
accessories
to
the
picture
they
noticed
indeed
that
the
young
man
whose
close
cropped
golden
curls
and
dark
lashed
blue
eyes
were
so
like
the
girl
that
he
could
be
none
other
than
her
brother
rode
beside
the
older
man
who
was
presumably
the
father
and
that
the
dark
handsome
stranger
rode
away
beside
the
girl
not
a
man
of
them
but
resented
it
not
a
woman
of
them
but
regretted
it
then
shag
bunce
with
a
parting
word
to
his
small
but
complete
outfit
that
rode
behind
put
spurs
to
his
horse
lifted
his
sombrero
in
homage
to
the
lady
and
shot
to
the
front
of
the
line
his
shaggy
mane
by
which
came
his
name
floating
over
his
shoulders
out
into
the
sunshine
of
a
perfect
day
the
riders
went
and
the
group
around
the
platform
stood
silently
and
watched
until
they
were
a
speck
in
the
distance
blurring
with
the
sunny
plain
and
occasional
ash
and
cottonwood
trees
i
seen
the
missionary
go
by
early
this
mornin
speculated
the
station
agent
meditatively
deliberately
as
though
he
only
had
a
right
to
break
the
silence
i
wonder
whar
he
could
bin
goin
he
passed
on
side
the
track
er
i
ast
he
in
a
turrible
hurry
anybody
sick
over
towards
the
canyon
way
buck
papoose
heap
sick
muttered
an
immobile
indian
and
shuffled
off
the
platform
with
a
stolid
face
the
women
heaved
a
sigh
of
disappointment
and
turned
to
go
the
show
was
out
and
they
must
return
to
the
monotony
of
their
lives
they
wondered
what
it
would
be
like
to
ride
off
like
that
into
the
sunshine
with
cheeks
like
roses
and
eyes
that
saw
nothing
but
pleasure
ahead
what
would
a
life
like
that
be
awed
speculative
they
went
back
to
their
sturdy
children
and
their
houses
to
sit
in
the
sun
on
the
and
muse
a
while
into
the
sunshine
rode
hazel
radcliffe
well
content
with
the
world
herself
and
her
escort
milton
hamar
was
good
company
he
was
keen
of
wit
and
a
in
the
delicate
art
of
flattery
that
he
was
fabulously
wealthy
and
popular
in
new
york
society
that
he
was
her
father
friend
both
socially
and
financially
and
had
been
much
of
late
in
their
home
on
account
of
some
vast
mining
enterprise
in
which
both
were
interested
and
that
his
wife
was
said
to
be
uncongenial
and
always
interested
in
other
men
rather
than
her
husband
were
all
facts
that
combined
to
give
hazel
a
pleasant
interest
in
the
man
by
her
side
she
had
been
conscious
of
a
sense
of
satisfaction
and
pleasant
anticipation
when
her
father
told
her
that
he
was
to
be
of
their
party
his
wit
and
gallantry
would
make
up
for
the
necessity
of
having
her
aunt
maria
along
aunt
maria
was
always
a
damper
to
anything
she
came
near
she
was
the
personification
of
propriety
she
had
tried
to
make
hazel
think
she
must
remain
in
the
car
and
rest
that
day
instead
of
going
off
on
a
wild
goose
chase
after
a
mine
no
lady
did
such
things
she
told
her
niece
hazel
laugh
rang
out
like
the
notes
of
a
bird
as
the
two
rode
slowly
down
the
trail
not
hurrying
for
there
was
plenty
of
time
they
could
meet
the
others
on
their
way
back
if
they
did
not
get
to
the
mine
so
soon
and
the
morning
was
lovely
milton
hamar
could
appreciate
the
beauties
of
nature
now
and
then
he
called
attention
to
the
line
of
hills
in
the
distance
and
the
sharp
steep
peak
of
a
mountain
piercing
the
sunlight
then
skillfully
he
led
his
speech
around
to
his
companion
and
showed
how
lovelier
than
the
morning
she
was
he
had
been
indulging
in
such
delicate
flattery
since
they
first
started
from
new
york
whenever
the
indefatigable
aunt
left
them
alone
long
enough
but
this
morning
there
was
a
note
of
something
closer
and
more
intimate
in
his
words
a
warmth
of
tenderness
that
implied
unspeakable
joy
in
her
beauty
such
as
he
had
never
dared
to
use
before
it
flattered
her
pride
deliciously
it
was
beautiful
to
be
young
and
charming
and
have
a
man
say
such
things
with
a
look
like
that
in
his
eyes
eyes
that
had
suffered
and
appealed
to
her
to
pity
with
her
young
innocent
heart
she
did
pity
and
was
glad
she
might
solace
his
sadness
a
little
while
with
consummate
skill
the
man
led
her
to
talk
of
himself
his
hopes
in
youth
his
disappointments
his
bitter
sadness
his
heart
loneliness
he
suddenly
asked
her
to
call
him
milton
and
the
girl
with
rosy
cheeks
and
dewy
eyes
declared
shyly
that
she
never
could
it
would
seem
so
queer
but
she
finally
compromised
after
much
urging
on
cousin
milton
that
will
do
for
a
while
he
succumbed
smiling
as
he
looked
at
her
with
impatient
eyes
then
with
growing
intimacy
in
his
tones
he
laid
a
detaining
hand
upon
hers
that
held
the
bridle
and
the
horses
both
slackened
their
gait
though
they
had
been
far
behind
the
rest
of
the
party
for
over
an
hour
now
listen
little
girl
he
said
i
going
to
open
my
heart
to
you
going
to
tell
you
a
secret
hazel
sat
very
still
half
alarmed
at
his
tone
not
daring
to
withdraw
her
hand
for
she
felt
the
occasion
was
momentous
and
she
must
be
ready
with
her
sympathy
as
any
true
friend
would
be
her
heart
swelled
with
pride
that
it
was
to
her
he
came
in
his
trouble
then
she
looked
up
into
the
face
that
was
bending
over
hers
and
she
saw
triumph
not
trouble
in
his
eyes
even
then
she
did
not
understand
what
is
it
she
asked
trustingly
dear
child
said
the
man
of
the
world
impressively
i
knew
you
would
be
interested
well
i
will
tell
you
i
have
told
you
of
my
sorrow
now
i
will
tell
you
of
my
joy
it
is
this
when
i
return
to
new
york
i
shall
be
a
free
man
everything
is
complete
at
last
i
have
been
granted
a
divorce
from
ellen
and
there
remain
only
a
few
technicalities
to
be
attended
to
then
we
shall
be
free
to
go
our
ways
and
do
as
we
choose
a
divorce
gasped
hazel
appalled
not
you
divorced
yes
affirmed
the
happy
man
gaily
i
knew
you
be
surprised
almost
too
good
to
be
true
is
it
after
all
my
trouble
to
get
ellen
to
consent
but
she
your
wife
where
will
she
go
what
will
she
do
hazel
looked
up
at
him
with
troubled
eyes
half
bewildered
with
the
thought
she
did
not
realize
that
the
horses
had
stopped
and
that
he
still
held
her
hand
which
grasped
the
bridle
oh
ellen
will
be
married
at
once
he
answered
flippantly
that
the
reason
she
consented
at
last
she
going
to
marry
walling
stacy
you
know
and
from
being
stubborn
about
it
she
quite
in
a
hurry
to
make
any
arrangement
to
fix
things
up
now
she
going
to
be
married
gasped
hazel
as
if
she
had
not
heard
of
such
things
often
somehow
it
had
never
come
quite
so
close
to
her
list
of
friendships
before
and
it
shocked
her
inexpressibly
yes
she
going
to
be
married
at
once
so
you
see
there
no
need
to
think
of
her
ever
again
but
why
do
you
ask
me
what
i
am
going
to
do
oh
yes
said
hazel
recalling
her
lack
of
sympathy
at
once
you
startled
me
so
what
are
you
going
to
do
you
poor
man
what
can
you
do
oh
i
am
so
sorry
for
you
and
the
became
suffused
with
tears
no
need
to
feel
sorry
for
me
little
one
said
the
exultant
voice
and
he
looked
at
her
now
with
an
expression
she
had
never
seen
in
his
face
before
i
shall
be
happy
as
i
have
never
dreamed
of
before
he
said
i
am
going
to
be
married
too
i
am
going
to
marry
some
one
who
loves
me
with
all
her
heart
i
am
sure
of
that
though
she
has
never
told
me
so
i
am
going
to
marry
you
little
sweetheart
he
stooped
suddenly
before
she
could
take
in
the
meaning
of
his
words
and
flinging
his
free
arm
about
her
pressed
his
lips
upon
hers
with
a
wild
cry
like
some
terrified
creature
hazel
tried
to
draw
herself
away
and
finding
herself
held
fast
her
quick
anger
rose
and
she
lifted
the
hand
which
held
the
whip
and
blindly
slashed
the
air
about
her
her
eyes
closed
her
heart
swelling
with
horror
and
fear
a
great
repulsion
for
the
man
whom
hitherto
she
had
regarded
with
deep
respect
surged
over
her
to
get
away
from
him
at
once
was
her
greatest
desire
she
lashed
out
again
with
her
whip
blindly
not
seeing
what
she
struck
almost
beside
herself
with
wrath
and
fear
hamar
horse
reared
and
plunged
almost
unseating
his
rider
and
as
he
struggled
to
keep
his
seat
having
necessarily
released
the
girl
from
his
embrace
the
second
cut
of
the
whip
took
him
stingingly
across
the
eyes
causing
him
to
cry
out
with
the
pain
the
horse
reared
again
and
sent
him
sprawling
upon
the
ground
his
hands
to
his
face
his
senses
one
blank
of
pain
for
the
moment
hazel
knowing
only
that
she
was
free
followed
an
instinct
of
fear
and
struck
her
own
pony
on
the
flank
causing
the
little
beast
to
turn
sharply
to
right
angles
with
the
trail
he
had
been
following
and
dart
like
a
streak
across
the
level
plateau
thereafter
the
girl
had
all
she
could
do
to
keep
her
seat
she
had
been
wont
to
enjoy
a
run
in
the
park
with
her
groom
at
safe
distance
behind
her
she
was
proud
of
her
ability
to
ride
and
could
take
fences
as
well
as
her
young
brother
but
a
run
like
this
across
an
illimitable
space
on
a
creature
of
speed
like
the
wind
goaded
by
fear
and
knowing
the
limitations
of
his
rider
was
a
different
matter
the
swift
flight
took
her
breath
away
and
unnerved
her
she
tried
to
hold
on
to
the
saddle
with
her
shaking
hands
for
the
bridle
was
already
flying
loose
to
the
breeze
but
her
hold
seemed
so
slight
that
each
moment
she
expected
to
find
herself
lying
huddled
on
the
plain
with
the
pony
far
in
the
distance
her
lips
grew
white
and
cold
her
breath
came
short
and
painfully
her
eyes
were
strained
with
trying
to
look
ahead
at
the
constantly
receding
horizon
was
there
no
end
would
they
never
come
to
a
human
habitation
would
no
one
ever
come
to
her
rescue
how
long
could
a
pony
stand
a
pace
like
this
and
how
long
could
she
hope
to
hold
on
to
the
furious
flying
creature
off
to
the
right
at
last
she
thought
she
saw
a
building
it
seemed
hours
they
had
been
flying
through
space
in
a
second
they
were
close
by
it
it
was
a
cabin
standing
alone
upon
the
great
plain
with
in
patches
about
the
door
and
a
neat
rail
fence
around
it
she
could
see
one
window
at
the
end
and
a
tiny
chimney
at
the
back
could
it
be
that
any
one
lived
in
such
a
forlorn
spot
summoning
all
her
strength
as
they
neared
the
spot
she
flung
her
voice
out
in
a
wild
appeal
while
the
pony
hurled
on
but
the
wind
caught
the
feeble
effort
and
flung
it
away
into
the
vast
spaces
like
a
little
torn
worthless
fragment
of
sound
tears
stung
their
way
into
her
wide
dry
eyes
the
last
hairpin
left
its
mooring
and
slipped
down
to
earth
the
loosened
golden
hair
streamed
back
on
the
wind
like
hands
of
despair
wildly
clutching
for
help
and
the
jaunty
green
riding
cap
was
snatched
by
the
breeze
and
hung
upon
a
not
fifty
feet
from
the
cabin
gate
but
the
pony
rushed
on
with
the
frightened
girl
still
clinging
to
the
saddle
ii
the
man
about
noon
of
the
same
day
the
missionary
halted
his
horse
on
the
edge
of
a
great
mesa
and
looked
away
to
the
clear
blue
mountains
in
the
distance
john
brownleigh
had
been
in
arizona
for
nearly
three
years
yet
the
wonder
of
the
desert
had
not
ceased
to
charm
him
and
now
as
he
stopped
his
horse
to
rest
his
eyes
sought
the
vast
distances
stretched
in
every
direction
and
revelled
in
the
splendour
of
the
scene
those
mountains
at
which
he
was
gazing
were
more
than
a
hundred
miles
from
him
and
yet
they
stood
out
clear
and
distinct
in
the
wonderful
air
and
seemed
but
a
short
journey
away
below
him
were
ledges
of
rock
in
marvellous
colours
yellow
and
gray
crimson
and
green
piled
one
upon
another
with
the
strange
light
of
the
noonday
sun
playing
over
them
and
turning
their
colours
into
a
blaze
of
glory
beyond
was
a
stretch
of
sand
broken
here
and
there
by
greasewood
or
cactus
rearing
its
prickly
spines
grotesquely
off
to
the
left
were
pink
tinted
cliffs
and
a
little
farther
dark
buttes
on
the
other
hand
low
brown
and
white
hills
stretched
away
to
the
wonderful
petrified
forest
where
great
tracts
of
fallen
tree
trunks
and
chips
lay
locked
in
glistening
stone
to
the
south
he
could
see
the
familiar
and
farther
the
entrance
to
the
canyon
fringed
with
cedars
and
pines
the
grandeur
of
the
scene
impressed
him
anew
beautiful
beautiful
he
murmured
and
a
grand
god
to
have
it
so
then
a
shadow
of
sadness
passed
over
his
face
and
he
spoke
again
aloud
as
had
come
to
be
his
habit
in
this
vast
loneliness
i
guess
it
is
worth
it
he
said
worth
all
the
lonely
days
and
discouraging
months
and
disappointments
just
to
be
alone
with
a
wonderful
father
like
mine
he
had
just
come
from
a
three
days
trip
in
company
with
another
missionary
whose
station
was
a
two
days
journey
by
horseback
from
his
own
and
whose
cheery
little
home
was
presided
over
by
a
woman
come
recently
from
the
east
to
share
his
fortunes
the
delicious
dinner
prepared
for
her
husband
and
his
guests
the
air
of
comfort
in
the
shack
the
dainty
touches
that
showed
a
woman
hand
had
filled
brownleigh
with
a
noble
envy
not
until
this
visit
had
he
realized
how
very
much
alone
his
life
was
he
was
busy
of
course
from
morning
till
night
and
his
enthusiasm
for
his
work
was
even
greater
than
when
nearly
three
years
before
he
had
been
sent
out
by
the
board
to
minister
to
the
needs
of
the
indians
friends
he
had
by
the
score
wherever
a
white
man
or
trader
lived
in
the
region
he
was
always
welcome
and
the
indians
knew
and
loved
his
coming
he
had
come
around
this
way
now
to
visit
an
indian
hogan
where
the
shadow
of
death
was
hovering
over
a
little
indian
maiden
beloved
of
her
father
it
had
been
a
long
way
around
and
the
missionary
was
weary
with
many
days
in
the
saddle
but
he
was
glad
he
had
come
the
little
maid
had
smiled
to
see
him
and
felt
that
the
dark
valley
of
death
seemed
more
to
her
now
like
one
of
her
own
canyons
that
led
out
to
a
brighter
wider
day
since
she
had
heard
the
message
of
life
he
brought
her
but
as
he
looked
afar
over
the
long
way
he
had
come
and
thought
of
the
bright
little
home
where
he
had
dined
the
day
before
the
sadness
still
lingered
in
his
face
it
would
be
good
to
have
somebody
like
that
he
said
aloud
again
somebody
to
expect
me
and
be
glad
but
then
thoughtfully
i
suppose
there
are
not
many
girls
who
are
willing
to
give
up
their
homes
and
go
out
to
rough
it
as
she
has
done
it
is
a
hard
life
for
a
woman
for
that
kind
of
a
woman
a
pause
then
and
i
would
want
any
other
kind
his
eyes
grew
large
with
wistfulness
it
was
not
often
thus
that
the
cheery
missionary
stopped
to
think
upon
his
own
lot
in
life
his
heart
was
in
his
work
and
he
could
turn
his
hand
to
anything
there
was
always
plenty
to
be
done
yet
for
some
inexplicable
reason
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
really
got
into
the
work
and
outgrown
his
first
homesickness
he
was
hungry
for
companionship
he
had
seen
a
light
in
the
eyes
of
his
that
spoke
eloquently
of
the
comfort
and
joy
he
himself
had
missed
and
it
struck
deep
into
his
heart
he
had
stopped
here
on
this
mesa
with
the
vast
panorama
of
the
desert
spread
before
him
to
have
it
out
with
himself
the
horse
breathed
restfully
drooping
his
head
and
closing
his
eyes
to
make
the
most
of
the
brief
respite
and
the
man
sat
thinking
trying
to
fill
his
soul
with
the
beauty
of
the
scene
and
crowd
out
the
longings
that
had
pressed
upon
him
suddenly
he
raised
his
head
with
a
quiet
upward
motion
and
said
reverently
oh
my
christ
you
knew
what
this
loneliness
was
you
were
lonely
too
it
is
the
way
you
went
and
i
will
walk
with
you
that
will
be
good
he
sat
for
a
moment
with
uplifted
face
towards
the
vast
sky
his
fine
strong
features
touched
with
a
tender
light
their
sadness
changing
into
peace
then
with
the
old
cheery
brightness
coming
into
his
face
again
he
returned
to
the
earth
and
its
duties
billy
it
time
we
were
getting
on
he
remarked
to
his
horse
chummily
do
you
see
that
sun
in
the
heavens
it
get
there
before
we
do
if
we
do
look
out
and
we
due
at
the
fort
if
we
can
possibly
make
it
we
had
too
much
vacation
that
about
the
size
of
it
and
we
spoiled
we
lazy
billy
we
have
to
get
down
to
work
now
how
about
it
can
we
get
to
that
in
half
an
hour
try
for
it
old
fellow
and
then
we
have
a
good
drink
and
a
bite
to
eat
and
maybe
ten
minutes
for
a
nap
before
we
take
the
short
trail
home
there
some
of
the
corn
chop
left
for
you
billy
so
hustle
up
old
boy
and
get
there
billy
with
an
answering
snort
responded
to
his
master
words
and
carefully
picked
his
way
over
boulders
and
rocks
down
to
the
valley
below
but
within
a
half
mile
of
the
the
young
man
suddenly
halted
his
horse
and
sprang
from
the
saddle
stooping
in
the
sand
beside
a
tall
yucca
to
pick
up
something
that
gleamed
like
fire
in
the
sunlight
in
all
that
brilliant
glowing
landscape
a
bit
of
brightness
had
caught
his
eye
and
insistently
flung
itself
upon
his
notice
as
worthy
of
investigation
there
was
something
about
the
sharp
light
it
flung
that
spoke
of
another
world
than
the
desert
john
brownleigh
could
not
pass
it
by
it
might
be
only
a
bit
of
broken
glass
from
an
empty
flask
flung
carelessly
aside
but
it
did
not
look
like
that
he
must
see
wondering
he
stooped
and
picked
it
up
a
bit
of
bright
gold
on
the
handle
of
a
handsome
riding
whip
it
was
not
such
a
whip
as
people
in
this
region
carried
it
was
dainty
costly
elegant
a
lady
riding
whip
it
spoke
of
a
world
of
wealth
and
attention
to
expensive
details
as
far
removed
from
this
scene
as
possible
brownleigh
stood
still
in
wonder
and
turned
the
pretty
trinket
over
in
his
hand
now
how
did
that
whip
come
to
be
lying
in
a
bunch
of
on
the
desert
jewelled
too
and
that
must
have
given
the
final
keen
point
of
light
to
the
flame
which
made
him
stop
short
in
the
sand
to
pick
it
up
it
was
a
single
clear
stone
of
transparent
yellow
a
topaz
likely
he
thought
but
wonderfully
alive
with
light
set
in
the
end
of
the
handle
and
looking
closely
he
saw
a
handsome
monogram
engraved
on
the
side
and
made
out
the
letters
but
that
told
him
nothing
with
knit
brows
he
pondered
one
foot
in
the
stirrup
the
other
still
upon
the
desert
looking
at
the
elegant
toy
now
who
would
be
so
foolish
as
to
bring
a
thing
like
that
into
the
desert
there
were
no
lady
riders
anywhere
about
that
he
knew
save
the
major
sister
at
the
military
station
and
she
was
most
plain
in
all
her
appointments
this
frivolous
implement
of
horsemanship
never
belonged
to
the
sister
tourists
seldom
came
this
way
what
did
it
mean
he
sprang
into
the
saddle
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
scanned
the
plain
but
only
the
warm
shimmer
of
earth
appeared
nothing
living
could
be
seen
what
ought
he
to
do
about
it
was
there
any
way
he
might
find
out
the
owner
and
restore
the
lost
property
pondering
thus
his
eyes
divided
between
the
distance
and
the
glittering
they
came
to
the
and
brownleigh
dismounted
his
thoughts
still
upon
the
little
whip
it
very
strange
billy
i
ca
make
out
a
theory
that
suits
me
he
mused
aloud
if
any
one
has
been
riding
out
this
way
and
lost
it
will
they
perhaps
return
and
look
for
it
yet
if
i
leave
it
where
i
found
it
the
sand
might
drift
over
it
at
any
time
and
surely
in
this
sparsely
settled
country
i
shall
be
able
to
at
least
hear
of
any
strangers
who
might
have
carried
such
a
foolish
little
thing
then
too
if
i
leave
it
where
i
found
it
some
one
might
steal
it
well
i
guess
we
take
it
with
us
billy
we
hear
of
the
owner
somewhere
some
time
no
doubt
the
horse
answered
with
a
snort
of
satisfaction
as
he
lifted
his
moist
muzzle
from
the
edge
of
the
water
and
looked
contentedly
about
the
missionary
unstrapped
his
saddle
and
flung
it
on
the
ground
unfastening
the
bag
of
corn
chop
and
spreading
it
conveniently
before
his
dumb
companion
then
he
set
about
gathering
a
few
sticks
from
near
at
hand
and
started
a
little
blaze
in
a
few
minutes
the
water
was
bubbling
cheerfully
in
his
little
folding
tin
cup
for
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
bit
of
bacon
was
frying
in
a
diminutive
skillet
beside
it
corn
bread
and
tea
and
sugar
came
from
the
capacious
pockets
of
the
saddle
billy
and
his
missionary
made
a
good
meal
beneath
the
wide
bright
quiet
of
the
sky
when
the
corn
chop
was
finished
billy
let
his
long
lashes
droop
lower
and
lower
and
his
nose
go
down
and
down
until
it
almost
touched
the
ground
dreaming
of
more
corn
chop
and
happy
in
having
his
wants
supplied
but
his
master
stretched
at
full
length
upon
the
ground
with
hat
drawn
over
his
eyes
could
not
lose
himself
in
sleep
for
a
second
his
thoughts
were
upon
the
jewelled
whip
and
by
and
by
he
reached
his
hand
out
for
it
and
shoving
back
his
hat
lay
watching
the
glinting
of
lights
within
the
precious
heart
of
the
topaz
as
the
sun
caught
and
tangled
its
beams
in
the
sharp
facets
of
the
cutting
he
puzzled
his
mind
to
know
how
the
whip
came
to
be
in
the
desert
and
what
was
meant
by
it
one
reads
life
by
details
in
that
wide
and
lonely
land
this
whip
might
mean
something
but
what
at
last
he
dropped
his
hand
and
sitting
up
with
his
upward
glance
he
said
aloud
father
if
there
any
reason
why
i
ought
to
look
for
the
owner
guide
me
he
spoke
as
if
the
one
he
addressed
were
always
present
in
his
consciousness
and
they
were
on
terms
of
the
closest
intimacy
he
sprang
up
then
and
began
putting
the
things
together
as
if
the
burden
of
the
responsibility
were
upon
one
fully
able
to
bear
it
they
were
soon
on
their
way
again
billy
swinging
along
with
the
full
realization
of
the
nearness
of
home
the
way
now
led
towards
hazy
blue
lines
of
mesas
with
crags
and
ridges
here
and
there
across
the
valley
looking
like
a
miles
distant
lay
a
long
black
streak
the
line
of
the
gorge
of
the
canyon
its
dim
presence
seemed
to
grow
on
the
missionary
thought
as
he
drew
nearer
he
had
not
been
to
that
canyon
for
more
than
a
month
there
were
a
few
scattered
indians
living
with
their
families
here
and
there
in
corners
where
there
was
a
little
soil
the
thought
of
them
drew
him
now
he
must
make
out
to
go
to
them
soon
if
it
were
not
that
billy
had
been
so
far
he
would
go
up
there
this
afternoon
but
the
horse
needed
rest
if
the
man
did
not
and
there
was
of
course
no
real
hurry
about
the
matter
he
would
go
perhaps
in
the
morning
meantime
it
would
be
good
to
get
to
his
own
fireside
once
more
and
attend
to
a
few
letters
that
should
be
written
he
was
invited
to
the
fort
that
night
for
dinner
there
was
to
be
some
kind
of
a
frolic
some
visitors
from
the
east
he
had
said
he
would
come
if
he
reached
home
in
time
he
probably
would
but
the
idea
was
not
attractive
just
now
he
would
rather
rest
and
read
and
go
to
sleep
early
but
then
of
course
he
would
go
such
opportunities
were
none
too
frequent
in
this
lonely
land
though
in
his
present
mood
the
gay
doings
at
the
fort
did
not
appeal
to
him
strongly
besides
it
meant
a
ride
of
ten
miles
further
however
of
course
he
would
go
he
fell
to
musing
over
the
whip
again
and
in
due
time
he
arrived
at
his
own
home
a
little
shanty
with
a
chimney
at
the
back
and
four
big
windows
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
fenced
enclosure
about
the
structure
was
a
little
shed
for
billy
and
all
about
was
the
vast
plain
dotted
with
bushes
and
weeds
with
its
panorama
of
mountain
and
hill
valley
and
gorge
it
was
beautiful
but
it
was
desolate
there
were
neighbours
a
few
but
they
lived
at
magnificent
distances
we
ought
to
have
a
dog
billy
why
do
we
get
a
dog
to
welcome
us
home
said
brownleigh
slapping
the
horse
neck
affectionately
as
he
sprang
from
the
saddle
but
then
a
dog
would
go
along
with
us
he
so
there
be
three
of
us
to
come
home
instead
of
two
and
that
would
do
any
good
chickens
how
would
that
do
but
the
coyotes
would
steal
them
i
guess
we
have
to
get
along
with
each
other
old
fellow
the
horse
relieved
of
his
saddle
gave
a
shake
of
comfort
as
a
man
might
stretch
himself
after
a
weary
journey
and
trotted
into
his
shed
brownleigh
made
him
comfortable
and
turned
to
go
to
the
house
as
he
walked
along
by
the
fence
he
caught
sight
of
a
small
dark
object
hanging
on
a
a
short
distance
from
the
front
of
his
house
it
seemed
to
move
slightly
and
he
stopped
and
watched
it
a
second
thinking
it
might
be
some
animal
caught
in
the
bush
or
in
hiding
it
seemed
to
stir
again
as
objects
watched
intently
often
will
and
springing
over
the
rail
fence
brownleigh
went
to
investigate
nothing
in
that
country
was
left
to
uncertainty
men
liked
to
know
what
was
about
them
as
he
neared
the
bush
however
the
object
took
on
a
tangible
form
and
colour
and
coming
closer
he
picked
it
up
and
turned
it
over
clumsily
in
his
hand
a
little
velvet
riding
cap
undoubtedly
a
lady
with
the
name
of
a
famous
new
york
costumer
wrought
in
silk
letters
in
the
lining
yes
there
was
no
question
about
its
being
a
lady
cap
for
a
long
gleaming
golden
hair
with
an
undoubted
tendency
to
curl
still
clung
to
the
velvet
a
sudden
embarrassment
filled
him
as
though
he
had
been
handling
too
intimately
another
property
unawares
he
raised
his
eyes
and
shaded
them
with
his
hand
to
look
across
the
landscape
if
perchance
the
owner
might
be
at
hand
though
even
as
he
did
so
he
felt
a
conviction
that
the
little
velvet
cap
belonged
to
the
owner
of
the
whip
which
he
still
held
in
his
other
hand
where
was
and
who
could
she
be
for
some
minutes
he
stood
thinking
it
out
locating
the
exact
spot
in
his
memory
where
he
had
found
the
whip
it
had
not
been
on
any
regular
trail
that
was
strange
he
stooped
to
see
if
there
were
any
further
evidences
of
but
the
slight
breeze
had
softly
covered
all
definite
marks
he
was
satisfied
however
after
examining
the
ground
about
for
some
distance
either
way
that
there
could
have
been
but
one
horse
he
was
wise
in
the
lore
of
the
trail
by
certain
little
things
that
he
saw
or
did
not
see
he
came
to
this
conclusion
just
as
he
was
turning
to
go
back
to
his
cabin
he
came
to
a
halt
again
with
an
exclamation
of
wonder
for
there
close
at
his
feet
half
hidden
under
a
bit
of
sage
lay
a
small
shell
comb
he
stooped
and
picked
it
up
in
triumph
i
declare
i
have
quite
a
collection
he
said
aloud
are
there
any
more
by
these
tokens
i
may
be
able
to
find
her
after
all
and
he
started
with
a
definite
purpose
and
searched
the
ground
for
several
rods
ahead
then
going
back
and
taking
a
slightly
different
direction
he
searched
again
and
yet
again
looking
back
each
time
to
get
his
bearings
from
the
direction
where
he
had
found
the
whip
arguing
that
the
horse
must
likely
have
taken
a
pretty
straight
line
and
gone
at
a
rapid
pace
he
was
rewarded
at
last
by
finding
two
shell
hairpins
and
near
them
a
single
hoof
print
that
sheltered
by
a
heavy
growth
of
sage
had
escaped
the
obliteration
of
the
wind
this
he
knelt
and
studied
carefully
taking
in
all
the
details
of
size
and
shape
and
direction
then
finding
no
more
hairpins
or
combs
he
carefully
put
his
booty
into
his
pocket
and
hurried
back
to
the
cabin
his
brow
knit
in
deep
thought
father
is
this
thy
leading
he
paused
at
the
door
and
looked
up
he
opened
the
door
and
stepped
within
the
restfulness
of
the
place
called
to
him
to
stay
there
was
the
wide
fireplace
with
a
fire
laid
all
ready
for
the
touch
of
a
match
that
would
bring
the
pleasant
blaze
to
dispel
the
loneliness
of
the
place
there
was
the
easy
chair
his
one
luxury
with
its
leather
cushions
and
reclining
back
his
slippers
on
the
floor
close
by
the
little
table
with
its
student
lamp
his
college
paper
and
the
one
magazine
that
kept
him
in
touch
with
the
world
freshly
arrived
before
he
left
for
his
recent
trip
and
still
unopened
how
they
called
to
him
yet
when
he
laid
the
whip
upon
the
magazine
the
slanting
ray
of
sun
that
entered
by
the
door
caught
the
glory
of
the
topaz
and
sent
it
scintillating
and
somehow
the
magazine
lost
its
power
to
hold
him
one
by
one
he
laid
his
trophies
down
beside
the
whip
the
velvet
cap
the
hairpins
and
the
little
comb
and
then
stood
back
startled
with
the
wonder
of
it
and
looked
about
his
bachelor
quarters
it
was
a
pleasant
spot
far
lovelier
than
its
exterior
would
lead
one
to
suppose
a
navajo
blanket
hung
upon
one
wall
above
the
bed
and
another
enwrapped
and
completely
covered
the
bed
itself
making
a
spot
of
colour
in
the
room
and
giving
an
air
of
luxury
two
quaint
rugs
of
indian
workmanship
upon
the
floor
one
in
front
of
the
bed
the
other
before
the
fireplace
where
one
feet
would
rest
when
sitting
in
the
big
chair
did
much
to
hide
the
discrepancies
of
the
ugly
floor
a
rough
set
of
shelves
at
the
side
of
the
fireplace
handy
to
reach
from
the
easy
chair
were
filled
with
treasures
of
great
minds
the
books
he
loved
well
all
he
could
afford
to
bring
with
him
a
few
commentaries
not
many
an
encyclopedia
a
little
biography
a
few
classics
botany
biology
astronomy
and
a
much
worn
bible
on
the
wall
above
was
a
large
card
catalogue
of
indian
words
and
around
the
room
were
some
of
his
own
pencil
drawings
of
plants
and
animals
over
in
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
from
the
bed
was
a
table
covered
with
white
oilcloth
and
on
the
wall
behind
the
cupboard
which
held
his
dishes
and
his
stock
of
provisions
it
was
a
pleasant
spot
and
well
ordered
for
he
never
liked
to
leave
his
quarters
in
disarray
lest
some
one
might
enter
during
his
absence
or
come
back
with
him
besides
it
was
pleasanter
so
to
return
to
it
a
rough
closet
of
goodly
proportions
held
his
clothes
his
trunk
and
any
other
stores
he
stood
and
looked
about
it
now
and
then
let
his
eyes
travel
back
to
those
small
feminine
articles
on
the
little
table
beside
him
it
gave
him
a
strange
sensation
what
if
they
belonged
there
what
if
the
owner
of
them
lived
there
was
coming
in
in
a
minute
now
to
meet
him
how
would
it
seem
what
would
she
be
like
for
just
an
instant
he
let
himself
dream
and
reaching
out
touched
the
velvet
of
the
cap
then
took
it
in
his
hand
and
smoothed
its
silken
surface
a
faint
perfume
of
another
world
seemed
to
steal
from
its
texture
and
to
linger
on
his
hands
he
drew
a
breath
of
wonder
and
laid
it
down
then
with
a
start
he
came
to
himself
suppose
she
did
belong
and
were
out
somewhere
and
he
did
not
know
where
suppose
something
had
happened
to
her
the
horse
run
away
thrown
her
somewhere
perhaps
or
she
might
have
strayed
away
from
a
camp
and
lost
her
way
or
been
frightened
these
might
be
all
foolish
fantasies
of
a
weary
brain
but
the
man
knew
he
could
not
rest
until
he
had
at
least
made
an
attempt
to
find
out
he
sank
down
in
the
big
chair
for
a
moment
to
think
it
out
and
closed
his
eyes
making
swift
plans
billy
must
have
a
chance
to
rest
a
little
a
fagged
horse
could
not
accomplish
much
if
the
journey
were
far
and
the
need
for
haste
he
could
not
go
for
an
hour
yet
and
there
would
be
preparations
to
make
he
must
repack
the
with
feed
for
billy
food
for
himself
and
a
possible
stranger
restoratives
and
a
simple
remedy
or
two
in
case
of
accident
these
were
articles
he
always
took
with
him
on
long
journeys
he
considered
taking
his
camping
tent
but
that
would
mean
the
wagon
and
they
could
not
go
so
rapidly
with
that
he
must
not
load
billy
heavily
after
the
miles
he
had
already
come
but
he
could
take
a
bit
of
canvas
strapped
to
the
saddle
and
a
small
blanket
of
course
it
might
be
but
a
wild
goose
chase
after
all
yet
he
could
not
let
his
impression
go
unheeded
then
there
was
the
fort
in
case
he
found
the
lady
and
restored
her
property
in
time
he
might
be
able
to
reach
the
fort
by
evening
he
must
take
that
into
consideration
also
with
alacrity
he
arose
and
went
about
his
preparations
soon
having
his
small
baggage
in
array
his
own
toilet
came
next
a
bath
and
fresh
clothing
then
clean
shaven
and
ready
all
but
his
coat
he
flung
himself
upon
his
bed
for
ten
minutes
of
absolute
relaxation
after
which
he
felt
himself
quite
fit
for
the
expedition
springing
up
he
put
on
coat
and
hat
gathered
up
with
reverent
touch
the
bits
of
things
he
had
found
locked
his
cabin
and
went
out
to
billy
a
lump
of
sugar
in
his
hand
billy
old
fellow
we
under
orders
to
march
again
he
said
apologetically
and
billy
answered
with
a
neigh
of
pleasure
submitting
to
the
saddle
as
though
he
were
quite
ready
for
anything
required
of
him
now
father
said
the
missionary
with
his
upward
look
show
us
the
way
so
taking
the
direction
from
the
hoof
print
in
the
sand
billy
and
his
master
sped
away
once
more
into
the
westering
light
of
the
desert
towards
the
long
black
shadowed
entrance
of
the
canyon
iii
the
desert
hazel
as
she
was
borne
along
her
lovely
hair
streaming
in
the
wind
and
lashing
her
across
the
face
and
eyes
now
and
again
breath
coming
painfully
eyes
smarting
fingers
aching
in
the
hold
she
was
compelled
to
keep
upon
the
saddle
began
to
wonder
just
how
long
she
could
hold
out
it
seemed
to
her
it
was
a
matter
of
minutes
only
when
she
must
let
go
and
be
whirled
into
space
while
the
tempestuous
steed
sped
on
and
left
her
nothing
like
this
motion
had
ever
come
into
her
experience
before
she
had
been
run
away
with
once
but
that
was
like
a
cradle
to
this
tornado
of
motion
she
had
been
frightened
before
but
never
like
this
the
blood
pounded
in
her
head
and
eyes
until
it
seemed
it
would
burst
forth
and
now
and
again
the
surging
of
it
through
her
ears
gave
the
sensation
of
drowning
yet
on
and
on
she
went
it
was
horrible
to
have
no
bridle
and
nothing
to
say
about
where
she
should
go
no
chance
to
control
her
horse
it
was
like
being
on
an
express
train
with
the
engineer
dead
in
his
cab
and
no
way
to
get
to
the
brakes
they
must
stop
some
time
and
what
then
death
seemed
inevitable
and
yet
as
the
mad
rush
continued
she
almost
wished
it
might
come
and
end
the
horror
of
this
ride
it
seemed
hours
before
she
began
to
realize
that
the
horse
was
no
longer
going
at
quite
such
a
breakneck
speed
or
else
she
was
growing
accustomed
to
the
motion
and
getting
her
breath
she
could
not
quite
be
sure
which
but
little
by
little
she
perceived
that
the
mad
flying
had
settled
into
a
long
lope
the
pony
evidently
had
no
intention
of
stopping
and
it
was
plain
that
he
had
some
distinct
place
in
mind
to
which
he
was
going
as
straight
and
determinedly
as
any
human
being
ever
laid
out
a
course
and
forged
ahead
in
it
there
was
that
about
his
whole
beastly
contour
that
showed
it
was
perfectly
useless
to
try
to
deter
him
from
it
or
to
turn
him
aside
when
her
breath
came
less
painfully
hazel
made
a
fitful
little
attempt
to
drop
a
quiet
word
of
reason
into
his
ear
nice
pony
nice
good
pony
she
soothed
but
the
wind
caught
her
voice
and
flung
it
aside
as
it
had
flung
her
cap
a
few
moments
before
and
the
pony
only
laid
his
ears
back
and
fled
stolidly
on
she
gathered
her
forces
again
nice
pony
whoa
sir
she
cried
a
little
louder
than
the
last
time
and
trying
to
make
her
voice
sound
firm
and
commanding
but
the
pony
had
no
intention
of
and
though
she
repeated
the
command
many
times
her
voice
growing
each
time
more
firm
and
normal
he
only
showed
the
whites
of
his
eyes
at
her
and
continued
doggedly
on
his
way
she
saw
it
was
useless
and
the
tears
usually
with
her
under
fine
control
came
streaming
down
her
white
cheeks
pony
good
horse
pony
wo
you
stop
she
cried
and
her
words
ended
with
a
sob
but
still
the
pony
kept
on
the
desert
fled
about
her
yet
seemed
to
grow
no
shorter
ahead
and
the
dark
line
of
cloud
mystery
with
the
towering
mountains
beyond
were
no
nearer
than
when
she
first
started
it
seemed
much
like
riding
on
a
one
never
got
anywhere
only
no
flew
at
such
a
speed
yet
she
realized
now
that
the
pace
was
much
modified
from
what
it
had
been
at
first
and
the
pony
motion
was
not
hard
if
she
had
not
been
so
stiff
and
sore
in
every
joint
and
muscle
with
the
terrible
tension
she
had
kept
up
the
riding
would
not
have
been
at
all
bad
but
she
was
conscious
of
most
terrible
weariness
a
longing
to
drop
down
on
the
sand
of
the
desert
and
rest
not
caring
whether
she
ever
went
on
again
or
not
she
had
never
felt
such
terrible
weariness
in
her
life
she
could
hold
on
now
with
one
hand
and
relax
the
muscles
of
the
other
a
little
she
tried
with
one
hand
presently
to
do
something
with
that
sweeping
pennant
of
hair
that
lashed
her
in
the
face
so
unexpectedly
now
and
then
but
could
only
succeed
in
twisting
it
about
her
neck
and
tucking
the
ends
into
the
neck
of
her
riding
habit
and
from
this
frail
binding
it
soon
slipped
free
again
she
was
conscious
of
the
heat
of
the
sun
on
her
bare
head
the
smarting
of
her
eyes
the
pain
in
her
chest
was
subsiding
and
she
could
breathe
freely
again
but
her
heart
felt
tired
so
tired
and
she
wanted
to
lie
down
and
cry
would
she
never
get
anywhere
and
be
helped
how
soon
would
her
father
and
brother
miss
her
and
come
after
her
when
she
dared
she
looked
timidly
behind
and
then
again
more
lingeringly
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
same
awful
stretch
of
distance
with
mountains
of
bright
colour
in
the
boundaries
everywhere
not
a
living
thing
but
herself
and
the
pony
to
be
seen
it
was
awful
somewhere
between
herself
and
the
mountains
behind
was
the
place
she
had
started
from
but
the
bright
sun
shone
steadily
hotly
down
and
shimmered
back
again
from
the
bright
earth
and
nothing
broke
the
awful
repose
of
the
lonely
space
it
was
as
if
she
had
suddenly
been
caught
up
and
flung
out
into
a
world
where
was
no
other
living
being
why
did
they
not
come
after
her
surely
surely
pretty
soon
she
would
see
them
coming
they
would
spur
their
horses
on
when
they
found
she
had
been
run
away
with
her
father
and
brother
would
not
leave
her
long
in
this
horrible
plight
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
her
father
and
brother
had
been
for
some
time
out
of
sight
ahead
before
she
began
her
race
they
would
not
know
she
was
gone
at
once
but
of
course
hamar
would
do
something
he
would
not
leave
her
helpless
the
habit
of
years
of
trusting
him
assured
her
of
that
for
the
instant
she
had
forgotten
the
cause
of
her
flight
then
suddenly
she
remembered
it
with
sickening
thought
he
who
had
been
to
her
a
brave
fine
hero
suffering
daily
through
the
carelessness
of
a
wife
who
did
not
understand
him
had
stepped
down
from
his
pedestal
and
become
the
lowest
of
the
low
he
had
dared
to
kiss
her
he
had
said
he
would
marry
her
he
a
married
man
her
whole
soul
revolted
against
him
again
and
now
she
was
glad
she
had
run
away
glad
the
horse
had
taken
her
so
far
glad
she
had
shown
him
how
terrible
the
whole
thing
looked
to
her
she
was
even
glad
that
her
father
and
brother
were
far
away
too
for
the
present
until
she
should
adjust
herself
to
life
once
more
how
could
she
have
faced
them
after
what
happened
how
could
she
ever
live
in
the
same
world
with
that
man
again
that
fallen
hero
how
could
she
ever
have
thought
so
much
of
him
she
had
almost
worshipped
him
and
had
been
so
pleased
when
he
had
seemed
to
enjoy
her
company
and
complimented
her
by
telling
her
she
had
whiled
away
a
weary
hour
for
him
and
he
he
had
been
meaning
all
the
time
he
had
looked
at
her
with
that
thought
in
his
mind
oh
awful
degradation
there
was
something
so
revolting
in
the
memory
of
his
voice
and
face
as
he
had
told
her
that
she
closed
her
eyes
and
shuddered
as
she
recalled
it
and
once
more
the
tears
went
coursing
down
her
cheeks
and
she
sobbed
aloud
piteously
her
head
bowing
lower
and
lower
over
the
pony
neck
her
bright
hair
falling
down
about
her
shoulders
and
beating
against
the
animal
breast
and
knees
as
he
ran
her
stiffened
fingers
clutching
his
mane
to
keep
her
balance
her
whole
weary
little
form
drooping
over
his
neck
in
a
growing
exhaustion
her
entire
being
swept
by
alternate
waves
of
anger
revulsion
and
fear
perhaps
all
this
had
its
effect
on
the
beast
perhaps
somewhere
in
his
there
lay
a
spot
call
it
instinct
or
what
you
please
that
vibrated
in
response
to
the
distress
of
the
human
creature
he
carried
perhaps
the
fact
that
she
was
in
trouble
drew
his
sympathy
wicked
little
willful
imp
though
he
usually
was
certain
it
is
that
he
began
to
slacken
his
pace
decidedly
until
at
last
he
was
walking
and
finally
stopped
short
and
turned
his
head
about
with
a
troubled
neigh
as
if
to
ask
her
what
was
the
matter
the
sudden
cessation
of
the
motion
almost
threw
her
from
her
seat
and
with
new
fear
gripping
her
heart
she
clutched
the
pony
mane
the
tighter
and
looked
about
her
trembling
she
was
conscious
more
than
anything
else
of
the
vast
spaces
about
her
in
every
direction
of
the
loneliness
of
the
spot
and
her
own
desolate
condition
she
had
wanted
the
horse
to
stop
and
let
her
get
down
to
solid
ground
and
now
that
he
had
done
so
and
she
might
dismount
a
great
horror
filled
her
and
she
dared
not
but
with
the
lessening
of
the
need
for
keeping
up
the
tense
strain
of
nerve
and
muscle
she
suddenly
began
to
feel
that
she
could
not
sit
up
any
longer
that
she
must
lie
down
let
go
this
awful
strain
stop
this
uncontrollable
trembling
which
was
quivering
all
over
her
body
the
pony
too
seemed
wondering
impatient
that
she
did
not
dismount
at
once
he
turned
his
nose
towards
her
again
with
a
questioning
snuff
and
snort
and
showed
the
wicked
whites
of
his
eyes
in
wild
perplexity
then
a
panic
seized
her
what
if
he
should
start
to
run
again
she
would
surely
be
thrown
this
time
for
her
strength
was
almost
gone
she
must
get
down
and
in
some
way
gain
possession
of
the
bridle
with
the
bridle
she
might
perhaps
hope
to
guide
his
movements
and
make
further
wild
riding
impossible
slowly
painfully
guardedly
she
took
her
foot
from
the
stirrup
and
slipped
to
the
ground
her
cramped
feet
refused
to
hold
her
weight
for
the
moment
and
she
tottered
and
went
into
a
little
heap
on
the
ground
the
pony
feeling
his
duty
for
the
present
done
sidled
away
from
her
and
began
cropping
the
grass
hungrily
the
girl
sank
down
wearily
at
full
length
upon
the
ground
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
her
she
could
never
rise
again
she
was
too
weary
to
lift
her
hand
or
to
move
the
foot
that
was
twisted
under
her
into
a
more
comfortable
position
too
weary
to
even
think
then
suddenly
the
sound
of
the
animal
moving
steadily
away
from
her
roused
her
to
the
necessity
of
securing
him
if
he
should
get
away
in
this
wide
desolation
she
would
be
helpless
indeed
she
gathered
her
flagging
energy
and
got
painfully
upon
her
feet
the
horse
was
nearly
a
rod
away
and
moving
slowly
steadily
as
he
ate
with
now
and
then
a
restless
lifting
of
his
head
to
look
off
into
the
distance
and
take
a
few
determined
steps
before
he
stopped
for
another
bite
that
horse
had
something
on
his
mind
and
was
going
straight
towards
it
she
felt
that
he
cared
little
what
became
of
her
she
must
look
out
for
herself
this
was
something
she
had
never
had
to
do
before
but
the
instinct
came
with
the
need
slowly
tremblingly
feeling
her
weakness
she
stole
towards
him
a
bunch
of
grass
in
her
hand
she
had
plucked
as
she
came
holding
it
obviously
as
she
had
fed
a
lump
of
sugar
or
an
apple
to
her
finely
groomed
mare
in
new
york
but
the
grass
she
held
was
like
all
the
grass
about
him
and
the
pony
had
not
been
raised
a
pet
he
tossed
his
nose
energetically
and
scornfully
as
she
drew
near
and
hastened
on
a
pace
or
two
cautiously
she
came
on
again
talking
to
him
gently
pleadingly
complimentarily
nice
good
horsey
pretty
pony
so
he
was
but
he
only
edged
away
again
and
so
they
went
on
for
some
little
way
until
hazel
almost
despaired
of
catching
him
at
all
and
was
becoming
more
and
more
aware
of
the
vastness
of
the
universe
about
her
and
the
smallness
of
her
own
being
at
last
however
her
fingers
touched
the
bridle
she
felt
the
quick
jerk
strained
every
muscle
to
hold
on
and
found
she
had
conquered
he
was
in
her
hands
for
how
long
was
a
question
for
he
was
strong
enough
to
walk
away
and
drag
her
by
the
bridle
perhaps
and
she
knew
little
about
tricks
of
management
moreover
her
muscles
were
so
flabby
and
sore
with
the
long
ride
that
she
was
to
cope
with
the
wise
and
wicked
little
beast
she
dreaded
to
get
upon
his
back
again
and
doubted
if
she
could
if
she
tried
but
it
seemed
the
only
way
to
get
anywhere
or
to
keep
company
with
the
pony
for
she
could
not
hope
to
detain
him
by
mere
physical
force
if
he
decided
otherwise
she
stood
beside
him
for
a
moment
looking
about
her
over
the
wide
distance
everything
looked
alike
and
different
from
anything
she
had
ever
seen
before
she
must
certainly
get
on
that
pony
back
for
her
fear
of
the
desert
became
constantly
greater
it
was
almost
as
if
it
would
snatch
her
away
in
a
moment
more
if
she
stayed
there
longer
and
carry
her
into
vaster
realms
of
space
where
her
soul
would
be
lost
in
infinitude
she
had
never
been
possessed
by
any
such
feeling
before
and
it
frightened
her
unreasoningly
turning
to
the
pony
she
measured
the
space
from
the
ground
to
the
queer
saddle
and
wondered
how
people
mounted
such
things
without
a
groom
when
she
had
mounted
that
morning
it
had
been
milton
hamar
strong
arm
that
swung
her
into
the
saddle
and
his
hand
that
held
her
foot
for
the
instant
of
her
spring
the
memory
of
it
now
sent
a
shudder
of
dislike
over
her
whole
body
if
she
had
known
he
never
should
have
touched
her
the
blood
mounted
uncomfortably
into
her
tired
face
and
made
her
conscious
of
the
heat
of
the
day
and
of
a
burning
thirst
she
must
go
on
and
get
to
some
water
somewhere
she
could
not
stand
this
much
longer
carefully
securing
the
bridle
over
her
arm
she
reached
up
and
took
hold
of
the
saddle
doubtfully
at
first
and
then
desperately
tried
to
reach
the
stirrup
with
one
foot
failed
and
tried
again
and
then
wildly
struggling
jumping
kicking
she
vainly
sought
to
climb
back
to
the
saddle
but
the
pony
was
not
accustomed
to
such
a
demonstration
at
mounting
and
he
strongly
objected
tossing
his
head
he
reared
and
dashed
off
almost
throwing
the
girl
to
the
ground
and
frightening
her
terribly
nevertheless
the
desperation
of
her
situation
gave
her
strength
for
a
fresh
trial
and
she
struggled
up
again
and
almost
gained
her
seat
when
the
pony
began
a
series
of
circles
which
threw
her
down
and
made
her
dizzy
with
trying
to
keep
up
with
him
thus
they
played
the
desperate
game
for
half
an
hour
more
twice
the
girl
lost
the
bridle
and
had
to
get
it
again
by
stealthy
wiles
and
once
she
was
almost
on
the
point
of
giving
up
so
utterly
exhausted
was
she
but
the
pony
was
thirsty
too
and
he
must
have
decided
that
the
quickest
way
to
water
would
be
to
let
her
mount
for
finally
with
lifted
head
he
stood
stock
still
and
let
her
struggle
up
his
side
and
at
last
falling
from
sheer
weariness
she
sat
astonished
that
she
had
accomplished
it
she
was
on
his
back
and
she
would
never
dare
to
get
down
again
she
thought
until
she
got
somewhere
to
safety
but
now
the
animal
his
courage
renewed
by
the
bite
he
had
taken
started
snorting
off
at
a
rapid
pace
once
more
very
nearly
upsetting
his
rider
at
the
start
and
almost
losing
her
the
bridle
once
more
she
sat
trembling
and
gripping
bridle
and
saddle
for
some
time
having
enough
to
do
to
keep
her
seat
without
trying
to
direct
her
bearer
and
then
she
saw
before
her
a
sudden
descent
steep
but
not
very
long
and
at
its
bottom
a
great
puddle
of
dirty
water
the
pony
paused
only
an
instant
on
the
brink
and
then
began
the
descent
the
girl
cried
out
with
fear
but
managed
to
keep
her
seat
and
the
impatient
animal
was
soon
ankle
deep
in
the
water
drinking
long
and
blissfully
hazel
sat
looking
in
dismay
about
her
the
seemed
to
be
entirely
surrounded
by
steep
banks
like
that
they
had
descended
and
there
was
no
way
out
except
to
return
could
the
horse
climb
up
with
her
on
his
back
and
could
she
keep
her
seat
she
grew
cold
with
fear
at
the
thought
for
all
her
riding
experience
had
been
on
the
level
and
she
had
become
more
and
more
conscious
of
her
flagging
strength
besides
the
growing
thirst
was
becoming
awful
oh
for
just
one
drop
of
that
water
that
the
pony
was
enjoying
black
and
dirty
as
it
was
she
felt
she
could
drink
it
but
it
was
out
of
her
reach
and
she
dared
not
get
down
suddenly
a
thought
came
to
her
she
would
wet
her
handkerchief
and
moisten
her
lips
with
that
if
she
stooped
over
quite
carefully
she
might
be
able
to
let
it
down
far
enough
to
touch
the
water
she
pulled
the
small
bit
of
linen
from
the
tiny
pocket
of
her
habit
and
the
pony
as
if
to
help
her
waded
into
the
water
farther
until
her
skirt
almost
touched
it
now
she
found
that
by
putting
her
arm
about
the
pony
neck
she
could
dip
most
of
her
handkerchief
in
the
water
and
dirty
as
it
was
it
was
most
refreshing
to
bathe
her
face
and
hands
and
wrists
and
moisten
her
lips
but
the
pony
when
he
had
his
fill
had
no
mind
to
tarry
and
with
a
splash
a
plunge
and
a
wallow
that
gave
the
girl
an
unexpected
shower
bath
he
picked
his
way
out
of
the
hole
and
up
the
rocky
side
of
the
descent
while
she
clung
frightened
to
the
saddle
and
wondered
if
she
could
possibly
hang
on
until
they
were
up
on
the
mesa
again
the
dainty
handkerchief
dropped
in
the
flight
floated
pitifully
on
the
muddy
water
another
bit
of
comfort
left
behind
but
when
they
were
up
and
away
again
what
with
the
fright
and
the
fact
that
they
had
come
out
of
the
hole
on
the
opposite
side
from
that
which
they
had
entered
it
the
girl
had
lost
all
sense
of
direction
and
everywhere
stretched
away
one
vast
emptiness
edged
with
mountains
that
stood
out
clear
cold
and
unfriendly
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
earth
seemed
to
have
changed
while
they
were
down
at
the
drinking
hole
for
now
the
shadows
were
long
and
had
almost
a
menacing
attitude
as
they
crept
along
or
leaped
sideways
after
the
travellers
hazel
noticed
with
a
startled
glance
at
the
sky
that
the
sun
was
low
and
would
soon
be
down
and
that
of
course
where
the
sun
hung
like
a
great
burning
opal
must
be
the
west
but
that
told
her
nothing
for
the
sun
had
been
high
in
the
heavens
when
they
had
started
and
she
had
taken
no
note
of
direction
east
west
north
or
south
were
all
one
to
her
in
her
happy
life
that
she
had
hitherto
led
she
tried
to
puzzle
it
out
and
remember
which
way
they
had
turned
from
the
railroad
but
grew
more
bewildered
and
the
brilliant
display
in
the
west
flamed
alarmingly
as
she
realized
that
night
was
coming
on
and
she
was
lost
on
a
great
desert
with
only
a
wild
tired
little
pony
for
company
hungry
and
thirsty
and
weary
beyond
anything
she
had
ever
dreamed
before
they
had
been
going
down
into
a
broad
valley
for
some
little
time
which
made
the
night
seem
even
nearer
hazel
would
have
turned
her
horse
back
and
tried
to
retrace
her
steps
but
that
he
would
not
for
try
as
she
might
and
turn
him
as
she
would
he
circled
about
and
soon
was
in
the
same
course
again
so
that
now
the
tired
hands
could
only
hold
the
reins
stiffly
and
submit
to
be
carried
where
the
pony
willed
it
was
quite
evident
he
had
a
destination
in
view
and
knew
the
way
thereto
hazel
had
read
of
the
instinct
of
animals
she
began
to
hope
that
he
would
presently
bring
her
to
a
human
habitation
where
she
would
find
help
to
get
to
her
father
once
more
but
suddenly
even
the
glory
of
the
dying
sun
was
lost
as
the
horse
entered
the
dimness
of
the
canyon
opening
whose
high
walls
of
red
stone
rising
solemnly
on
either
hand
were
serrated
here
and
there
with
long
transverse
lines
of
grasses
and
growing
in
the
crevices
and
higher
up
appeared
the
black
openings
of
caves
mysterious
and
fearsome
in
the
twilight
gloom
the
way
ahead
loomed
darkly
somewhere
from
out
the
memories
of
her
childhood
came
a
phrase
from
the
to
which
she
had
never
given
conscious
attention
but
which
flashed
vividly
to
mind
now
though
i
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
the
valley
of
the
shadow
surely
this
must
be
it
she
wished
she
could
remember
the
rest
of
it
what
could
it
have
meant
she
shivered
visibly
and
looked
about
her
with
wild
eyes
the
cottonwoods
and
oaks
grew
thickly
at
the
base
of
the
cliffs
almost
concealing
them
sometimes
and
above
the
walls
rose
dark
and
towering
the
way
was
rough
and
slippery
filled
with
great
boulders
and
rocks
around
which
the
pony
picked
his
way
without
regard
to
the
branches
of
trees
that
swept
her
face
and
caught
in
her
long
hair
as
they
went
by
vainly
she
strove
to
guide
him
back
but
he
turned
only
to
whirl
again
determinedly
somewhere
in
the
deep
gloom
ahead
he
had
a
destination
and
no
mere
girl
was
to
deter
him
from
reaching
it
as
soon
as
possible
it
was
plain
to
his
that
his
rider
did
not
know
what
she
wanted
and
he
did
so
there
were
no
two
ways
about
it
he
intended
to
go
back
to
his
old
master
as
straight
and
as
fast
as
he
could
get
there
this
canyon
was
the
shortest
cut
and
through
this
canyon
he
meant
to
walk
whether
she
liked
it
or
not
further
and
further
into
the
gloom
they
penetrated
and
the
girl
frenzied
with
fear
cried
out
with
the
wild
hope
that
some
one
might
be
near
and
come
to
her
rescue
but
the
gloomy
aisle
of
the
canyon
caught
up
her
voice
and
echoed
it
far
and
high
until
it
came
back
to
her
in
a
volume
of
sepulchral
sound
that
filled
her
with
a
nameless
dread
and
made
her
fear
to
open
her
lips
again
it
was
as
if
she
had
by
her
cry
awakened
the
evil
spirit
who
inhabited
the
canyon
and
set
it
searching
for
the
intruder
help
help
how
the
words
rolled
and
returned
upon
her
trembling
senses
until
she
quaked
and
quivered
with
their
echoes
on
went
the
pony
into
the
deepening
shadows
and
each
moment
the
darkness
shut
down
more
impenetrably
until
the
girl
could
only
close
her
eyes
lower
her
head
as
much
as
possible
to
escape
the
branches
and
pray
then
suddenly
from
above
where
the
distant
sky
gave
a
line
of
light
and
a
single
star
had
appeared
to
pierce
the
dusk
like
a
great
jewel
on
a
lady
gown
there
arose
a
sound
and
hideous
high
hollow
chilling
her
soul
with
horror
and
causing
her
heart
to
stand
still
with
fear
she
had
heard
it
once
before
a
night
or
two
ago
when
their
train
had
stopped
in
a
wide
desert
for
water
or
repairs
or
something
and
the
porter
of
the
car
had
told
her
it
was
coyotes
it
had
been
distant
then
and
weird
and
interesting
to
think
of
being
so
near
real
live
wild
animals
she
had
peered
from
the
safety
of
her
berth
behind
the
silken
curtains
and
fancied
she
saw
shadowy
forms
steal
over
the
plain
under
the
moonlight
but
it
was
a
very
different
thing
to
hear
the
sound
now
out
alone
among
their
haunts
with
no
weapon
and
none
to
protect
her
the
awfulness
of
her
situation
almost
took
away
her
senses
still
she
held
to
the
saddle
weak
and
trembling
expecting
every
minute
to
be
her
last
and
the
horrid
howling
of
the
coyotes
continued
down
below
the
trail
somewhere
she
could
hear
the
soft
trickling
of
water
with
maddening
distinctness
now
and
then
oh
if
she
could
but
quench
this
terrible
thirst
the
pony
was
somewhat
refreshed
with
his
grass
and
his
drink
of
water
but
the
girl
whose
life
up
to
this
day
had
never
known
a
want
unsatisfied
was
faint
with
hunger
and
burning
with
thirst
and
this
unaccustomed
demand
upon
her
strength
was
fast
bringing
it
to
its
limit
the
darkness
in
the
canyon
grew
deeper
and
more
stars
clustered
out
overhead
but
far
so
very
far
away
the
coyotes
seemed
just
a
shadow
removed
all
about
and
above
her
senses
were
swimming
she
could
not
be
sure
just
where
they
were
the
horse
slipped
and
stumbled
on
in
the
darkness
and
she
forgot
to
try
to
turn
him
from
his
purpose
by
and
by
she
grew
conscious
that
the
way
was
leading
upward
again
they
were
scrambling
over
rough
places
large
rocks
in
the
way
trees
growing
close
to
the
trail
and
the
pony
seemed
not
to
be
able
to
avoid
them
or
perhaps
he
did
care
the
howling
of
the
coyotes
was
growing
clearer
every
minute
but
somehow
her
fear
of
them
was
deadened
as
her
fear
of
all
else
she
was
lying
low
upon
the
pony
clinging
to
his
neck
too
faint
to
cry
out
too
weak
to
stop
the
tears
that
slowly
wet
his
mane
then
suddenly
she
was
caught
in
the
embrace
of
a
low
hanging
branch
her
hair
tangled
about
its
roughness
the
pony
struggled
to
gain
his
uncertain
footing
the
branch
held
her
fast
and
the
pony
scrambled
on
leaving
his
helpless
rider
behind
him
in
a
little
huddled
heap
upon
the
rocky
trail
swept
from
the
saddle
by
the
tough
old
branch
the
pony
stopped
a
moment
upon
a
bit
of
shelving
rock
he
had
with
difficulty
gained
and
looked
back
with
a
troubled
snort
but
the
huddled
heap
in
the
darkness
below
him
gave
forth
no
sign
of
life
and
after
another
snort
and
a
half
neigh
of
warning
the
pony
turned
and
scrambled
on
up
and
up
till
he
gained
the
mesa
above
the
late
moon
rose
and
hunted
its
way
through
the
canyon
till
it
found
the
gold
of
her
hair
spread
about
on
the
rocky
way
and
touched
her
sweet
unconscious
face
with
the
light
of
cold
beauty
the
coyotes
howled
on
in
solemn
chorus
and
still
the
little
figure
lay
quiet
and
unconscious
of
her
situation
iv
the
quest
john
brownleigh
reached
the
at
sunset
and
while
he
waited
for
his
horse
to
drink
he
meditated
on
what
he
would
do
next
if
he
intended
to
go
to
the
fort
for
dinner
he
should
turn
at
once
sharply
to
the
right
and
ride
hard
unless
he
was
willing
to
be
late
the
lady
at
the
fort
liked
to
have
her
guests
on
hand
promptly
he
knew
the
sun
was
down
it
had
left
long
splashes
of
crimson
and
gold
in
the
west
and
their
reflection
was
shimmering
over
the
muddy
water
below
him
so
that
billy
looked
as
if
he
quaffed
the
richest
wine
from
a
golden
cup
as
he
satisfied
his
thirst
contentedly
but
as
the
missionary
watched
the
painted
water
and
tried
to
decide
his
course
suddenly
his
eye
caught
a
bit
of
white
something
floating
half
clinging
to
a
twig
at
the
edge
of
the
water
a
bit
of
thin
transparentness
with
delicate
lacy
edge
it
startled
him
in
that
desert
place
much
as
the
jewel
in
its
golden
setting
in
the
sand
had
startled
him
that
morning
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
he
stooped
over
picked
up
the
little
wet
handkerchief
and
held
it
out
dainty
white
and
fine
and
in
spite
of
its
wet
condition
sending
forth
its
violet
breath
to
the
senses
of
a
man
who
had
been
in
the
wilds
of
the
desert
for
three
years
it
spoke
of
refinement
and
culture
and
a
world
he
had
left
behind
him
in
the
east
there
was
a
tiny
letter
embroidered
in
the
corner
but
already
the
light
was
growing
too
dim
to
read
it
and
though
he
held
it
up
and
looked
through
it
and
felt
the
embroidery
with
his
he
could
not
be
sure
that
it
was
either
of
the
letters
that
had
been
engraved
on
the
whip
nevertheless
the
little
white
messenger
determined
his
course
he
searched
the
edge
of
the
for
hoof
prints
as
well
as
the
dying
light
would
reveal
then
mounted
billy
with
decision
at
once
and
took
up
his
quest
where
he
had
almost
abandoned
it
he
was
convinced
that
a
lady
was
out
alone
in
the
desert
somewhere
it
was
long
past
midnight
when
billy
and
the
missionary
came
upon
the
pony
high
on
the
mesa
grazing
the
animal
had
evidently
felt
the
need
for
food
and
rest
before
proceeding
further
and
was
perhaps
a
little
uneasy
about
that
huddled
form
in
the
darkness
he
had
left
billy
and
the
pony
were
soon
hobbled
and
left
to
feed
together
while
the
missionary
all
thought
of
his
own
need
of
rest
forgotten
began
a
systematic
search
for
the
missing
rider
he
first
carefully
examined
the
pony
and
saddle
the
saddle
somehow
reminded
him
of
shag
bunce
but
the
pony
was
a
stranger
to
him
neither
could
he
make
out
the
letter
of
the
brand
in
the
pale
moonlight
however
it
might
be
a
new
animal
just
purchased
and
not
yet
branded
or
there
might
be
a
thousand
explanations
the
thought
of
shag
bunce
reminded
him
of
the
handsome
private
car
he
had
seen
upon
the
track
that
morning
but
even
if
a
party
had
gone
out
to
ride
how
would
one
of
them
get
separated
surely
no
lady
would
venture
over
the
desert
alone
not
a
stranger
at
any
rate
still
in
the
silver
and
black
of
the
shadowed
night
he
searched
on
and
not
until
the
rosy
light
of
dawning
began
to
flush
and
grow
in
the
east
did
he
come
to
stand
at
the
top
of
the
canyon
where
he
could
look
down
and
see
the
girl
her
green
riding
habit
blending
darkly
with
the
dark
forms
of
the
trees
still
in
shadow
the
gold
of
her
hair
glinted
with
the
early
light
and
her
white
white
face
turned
upward
he
lost
no
time
in
climbing
down
to
her
side
dreading
what
he
might
find
was
she
dead
what
had
happened
to
her
it
was
a
perilous
spot
where
she
lay
and
the
dangers
that
might
have
harmed
her
had
been
many
the
sky
grew
pink
and
tinted
all
the
clouds
with
rose
as
he
knelt
beside
the
still
form
a
moment
served
to
convince
him
that
she
was
still
alive
even
in
the
half
darkness
he
could
see
the
drawn
weary
look
of
her
face
poor
child
poor
little
girl
lost
on
the
desert
he
was
glad
glad
he
had
come
to
find
her
he
gathered
her
in
his
strong
arms
and
bore
her
upward
to
the
light
laying
her
in
a
sheltered
spot
he
quickly
brought
water
bathed
her
face
and
forced
a
stimulant
between
the
white
lips
he
chafed
her
cold
little
hands
blistered
with
the
bridle
gave
her
more
stimulant
and
was
rewarded
by
seeing
a
faint
colour
steal
into
the
lips
and
cheeks
finally
the
white
lids
fluttered
open
for
a
second
and
gave
him
a
glimpse
of
great
dark
eyes
in
which
was
still
mirrored
the
horror
and
fright
of
the
night
he
gave
her
another
draught
and
hastened
to
prepare
a
more
comfortable
resting
place
bringing
the
canvas
from
billy
pack
and
one
or
two
other
little
articles
that
might
make
for
comfort
among
them
a
small
hot
water
bottle
when
he
had
her
settled
on
the
canvas
with
sweet
ferns
and
grass
underneath
for
a
pillow
and
his
own
blanket
spread
over
her
he
set
about
gathering
wood
for
a
fire
and
soon
he
had
water
boiling
in
his
tin
cup
enough
to
fill
the
rubber
bottle
when
he
put
it
in
her
cold
hands
she
opened
her
eyes
again
wonderingly
he
smiled
reassuringly
and
she
nestled
down
contentedly
with
the
comfort
of
the
warmth
she
was
too
weary
to
question
or
know
aught
save
that
relief
from
a
terrible
horror
was
come
at
last
the
next
time
he
came
to
her
it
was
with
a
cup
of
strong
beef
tea
which
he
held
to
her
lips
and
coaxed
her
to
swallow
when
it
was
finished
she
lay
back
and
slept
again
with
a
long
drawn
trembling
sigh
that
was
almost
like
a
sob
and
the
heart
of
the
young
man
was
shaken
to
its
depths
over
the
agony
through
which
she
must
have
passed
poor
child
poor
little
child
he
busied
himself
with
making
their
temporary
camp
as
comfortable
as
possible
and
looking
after
the
needs
of
the
horses
then
coming
back
to
his
patient
he
stood
looking
down
at
her
as
she
slept
wondering
what
he
ought
to
do
next
they
were
a
long
distance
from
any
human
habitation
whatever
made
the
pony
take
this
lonely
trail
was
a
puzzle
it
led
to
a
distant
indian
settlement
and
doubtless
the
animal
was
returning
to
his
former
master
but
how
had
it
come
that
the
rider
had
not
turned
him
back
then
he
looked
down
at
the
frail
girl
asleep
on
the
ground
and
grew
grave
as
he
thought
of
the
perils
through
which
she
had
passed
alone
and
unguarded
the
exquisite
delicacy
of
her
face
touched
him
as
the
vision
of
an
angelic
being
might
have
done
and
for
an
instant
he
forgot
everything
in
the
wonder
with
which
her
beauty
filled
him
the
lovely
outline
of
the
profile
as
it
rested
lightly
against
her
raised
arm
the
fineness
and
length
of
her
wealth
of
hair
like
spun
gold
in
the
glint
of
the
sunshine
that
was
just
peering
over
the
rim
of
the
mountain
the
clearness
of
her
skin
so
white
and
different
from
the
women
in
that
region
the
pitiful
droop
of
the
sweet
lips
showing
utter
exhaustion
his
heart
went
out
from
him
with
longing
to
comfort
her
guard
her
and
bring
her
back
to
happiness
a
strange
joyful
tenderness
for
her
filled
him
as
he
looked
so
that
he
could
scarcely
draw
his
gaze
from
her
face
then
all
at
once
it
came
over
him
that
she
would
not
like
a
stranger
thus
to
stand
and
gaze
upon
her
helplessness
and
with
quick
reverence
he
turned
his
eyes
away
towards
the
sky
it
was
a
peculiar
morning
wonderfully
beautiful
the
clouds
were
tinted
pink
almost
like
a
sunset
and
lasted
so
for
over
an
hour
as
if
the
dawn
were
coming
gently
that
it
might
not
waken
her
who
slept
brownleigh
with
one
more
glance
to
see
if
his
patient
was
comfortable
went
softly
away
to
gather
wood
bring
more
water
and
make
various
little
preparations
for
a
breakfast
later
when
she
should
waken
in
an
hour
he
tiptoed
back
to
see
if
all
was
going
well
and
stooping
laid
a
practiced
finger
on
the
delicate
wrist
to
note
the
flutter
of
her
pulse
he
could
count
it
with
care
feeble
as
if
the
heart
had
been
under
heavy
strain
but
still
growing
steadier
on
the
whole
she
was
doing
well
to
sleep
it
was
better
than
any
medicine
he
could
administer
meantime
he
must
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
travellers
they
were
quite
off
the
trail
here
and
the
trail
was
an
old
one
anyway
and
almost
disused
there
was
little
likelihood
of
many
passers
it
might
be
days
before
any
one
came
that
way
there
was
no
human
habitation
within
call
and
he
dared
not
leave
his
charge
to
go
in
search
of
help
to
carry
her
back
to
civilization
again
he
must
just
wait
here
till
she
was
able
to
travel
it
occurred
to
him
to
wonder
where
she
belonged
and
how
she
came
to
be
thus
alone
and
whether
it
was
not
altogether
probable
that
a
party
of
searchers
might
be
out
soon
with
some
kind
of
a
conveyance
to
carry
her
home
he
must
keep
a
sharp
lookout
and
signal
any
passing
rider
to
this
end
he
moved
away
from
the
sleeping
girl
as
far
as
he
dared
leave
her
and
uttered
a
long
clear
call
occasionally
but
no
answer
came
he
dared
not
use
his
rifle
for
signalling
lest
he
run
out
of
ammunition
which
he
might
need
before
he
got
back
with
his
charge
however
he
felt
it
wise
to
combine
hunting
with
signalling
and
when
a
rabbit
hurried
across
his
path
not
far
away
he
shot
it
and
the
sound
echoed
out
in
the
clear
morning
but
no
answering
signal
came
after
he
had
shot
two
rabbits
and
dressed
them
ready
for
dinner
when
his
guest
should
wake
he
replenished
the
fire
set
the
rabbits
to
roasting
on
a
curious
little
device
of
his
own
and
lay
down
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
he
was
weary
beyond
expression
himself
but
he
never
thought
of
it
once
the
excitement
of
the
occasion
kept
him
up
he
lay
still
marvelling
at
the
strangeness
of
his
position
and
wondering
what
would
be
revealed
when
the
girl
should
wake
he
almost
dreaded
to
have
her
do
so
lest
she
should
not
be
as
perfect
as
she
looked
asleep
his
heart
was
in
a
tumult
of
wonder
over
her
and
of
thankfulness
that
he
had
found
her
before
some
terrible
fate
had
overtaken
her
as
he
lay
there
resting
filled
with
an
exalted
joy
his
mind
wandered
to
the
longings
of
the
day
before
the
little
adobe
home
of
his
which
he
had
left
its
homeyness
and
joy
his
own
loneliness
and
longing
for
companionship
then
he
looked
shyly
towards
the
tree
shade
where
the
glint
of
golden
hair
and
the
dark
line
of
his
blanket
were
all
he
could
see
of
the
girl
he
had
found
in
the
wilderness
what
if
his
father
had
answered
his
prayer
and
sent
her
to
him
what
miracle
of
joy
a
thrill
of
tenderness
passed
through
him
and
he
pressed
his
hands
over
his
closed
eyes
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
what
foolishness
dreams
of
course
he
tried
to
sober
himself
but
he
could
not
keep
from
thinking
how
it
would
seem
to
have
this
lovely
girl
enthroned
in
his
little
shack
ready
to
share
his
joys
and
comfort
his
sorrows
to
be
beloved
and
guarded
and
tenderly
cared
for
by
him
a
stir
of
the
old
blanket
and
a
softly
drawn
sigh
brought
this
delicious
reverie
to
a
close
and
himself
to
his
feet
flushing
cold
and
hot
at
thought
of
facing
her
awake
she
had
turned
over
towards
him
slightly
her
cheeks
flushed
with
sleep
one
hand
was
thrown
back
over
her
head
and
the
sun
caught
and
flashed
the
sparkle
of
jewels
into
his
eyes
great
gems
like
drops
of
morning
dew
when
the
sun
is
new
upon
them
and
the
flash
of
the
jewels
told
him
once
more
what
he
had
known
before
that
here
was
a
daughter
of
another
world
than
his
they
seemed
to
hurt
him
as
he
looked
those
costly
gems
for
they
pierced
to
his
heart
and
told
him
they
were
set
on
a
wall
of
separation
which
might
rise
forever
between
her
and
himself
then
suddenly
he
came
to
himself
and
was
the
missionary
again
with
his
senses
all
on
the
alert
and
a
keen
realization
that
it
was
high
noon
and
his
patient
was
waking
up
he
must
have
slept
himself
although
he
thought
he
had
been
broad
awake
all
the
time
the
hour
had
come
for
action
and
he
must
put
aside
the
foolish
thoughts
that
had
crowded
in
when
his
weary
brain
was
unable
to
cope
with
the
cool
facts
of
life
of
course
all
this
was
stuff
and
nonsense
that
he
had
been
dreaming
he
must
do
his
duty
by
this
needy
one
now
stepping
softly
he
brought
a
cup
of
water
that
he
had
placed
in
the
shade
to
keep
cool
and
stood
beside
the
girl
speaking
quietly
as
though
he
had
been
her
nurse
for
years
would
you
like
a
drink
of
water
he
asked
the
girl
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
up
at
him
bewildered
oh
yes
she
said
eagerly
though
her
voice
was
very
weak
oh
yes
i
so
i
thought
we
never
would
get
anywhere
she
let
him
lift
her
head
and
drank
eagerly
then
sank
back
exhausted
and
closed
her
eyes
he
almost
thought
she
was
going
to
sleep
again
would
you
like
something
to
eat
he
asked
dinner
is
almost
ready
do
you
think
you
can
sit
up
to
eat
or
would
you
rather
lie
still
dinner
she
said
languidly
but
i
thought
it
was
night
did
i
dream
it
all
and
how
did
i
get
here
i
do
remember
this
place
she
looked
around
curiously
and
then
closed
her
eyes
as
if
the
effort
were
almost
too
much
oh
i
feel
so
queer
and
tired
as
if
i
never
wanted
to
move
again
she
murmured
do
move
he
commanded
wait
until
you
had
something
to
eat
i
bring
it
at
once
he
brought
a
cup
of
steaming
hot
beef
extract
with
little
broken
bits
of
biscuit
from
a
small
tin
box
in
the
pack
and
fed
it
to
her
a
spoonful
at
a
time
who
are
you
she
asked
as
she
swallowed
the
last
spoonful
and
opened
her
eyes
which
had
been
closed
most
of
the
time
while
he
fed
her
as
if
she
were
too
tired
to
keep
them
open
oh
i
just
the
missionary
brownleigh
my
name
now
do
talk
until
you
had
the
rest
of
your
dinner
i
bring
it
in
a
minute
i
want
to
make
you
a
cup
of
tea
but
you
see
i
have
to
wash
this
cup
first
the
supply
of
dishes
is
limited
his
genial
smile
and
hearty
words
reassured
her
and
she
smiled
and
submitted
a
missionary
she
mused
and
opened
her
eyes
furtively
to
watch
him
as
he
went
about
his
task
a
missionary
she
had
never
seen
a
missionary
before
to
her
knowledge
she
had
fancied
them
always
quite
a
different
species
plain
old
maids
with
hair
tightly
drawn
behind
their
ears
and
a
poke
bonnet
with
little
white
lawn
strings
this
was
a
man
young
strong
engaging
and
handsome
as
a
fine
piece
of
bronze
the
brown
flannel
shirt
he
wore
fitted
easily
over
well
knit
muscles
and
exactly
matched
the
brown
of
the
abundant
wavy
hair
in
which
the
morning
sun
was
setting
glints
of
gold
as
he
knelt
before
the
fire
and
deftly
completed
his
cookery
his
soft
felt
hat
pushed
far
back
on
the
head
the
corduroy
trousers
leather
chaps
and
belt
with
brace
of
pistols
all
fitted
into
the
picture
and
made
the
girl
feel
that
she
had
suddenly
left
the
earth
where
she
had
heretofore
lived
and
been
dropped
into
an
unknown
land
with
a
strong
kind
angel
to
look
after
her
a
missionary
then
of
course
she
need
be
afraid
of
him
as
she
studied
his
face
she
knew
that
she
could
possibly
have
been
afraid
of
that
face
anyway
unless
perhaps
she
had
ventured
to
disobey
its
owner
orders
he
had
a
strong
firm
chin
and
his
lips
though
kindly
in
their
curve
looked
decided
as
though
they
were
not
to
be
trifled
with
on
the
whole
if
this
was
a
missionary
then
she
must
change
her
ideas
of
missionaries
from
this
time
forth
she
watched
his
light
free
movements
now
sitting
back
upon
his
heels
to
hold
the
cup
of
boiling
water
over
the
blaze
by
a
curiously
contrived
handle
now
rising
and
going
to
the
saddle
pack
for
some
needed
article
there
was
something
graceful
as
well
as
powerful
about
his
every
motion
he
gave
one
a
sense
of
strength
and
almost
infinite
resource
then
suddenly
her
imagination
conjured
there
beside
him
the
man
from
whom
she
had
fled
and
in
the
light
of
this
fine
face
the
other
face
darkened
and
weakened
and
she
had
a
swift
revelation
of
his
true
character
and
wondered
that
she
had
never
known
before
a
shudder
passed
over
her
and
a
gray
pallor
came
into
her
face
at
the
memory
she
felt
a
great
distaste
for
thinking
or
the
necessity
for
even
living
at
that
moment
then
at
once
he
was
beside
her
with
a
tin
plate
and
the
cup
of
steaming
tea
and
began
to
feed
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
baby
roast
rabbit
and
toasted
corn
bread
she
ate
unquestioningly
and
drank
her
tea
finding
all
delicious
after
her
long
fast
and
gaining
new
strength
with
every
mouthful
how
did
i
get
here
she
asked
suddenly
rising
to
one
elbow
and
looking
around
i
do
seem
to
remember
a
place
like
this
i
found
you
hanging
on
a
bush
in
the
moonlight
he
said
gravely
and
brought
you
here
hazel
lay
back
and
reflected
on
this
he
had
brought
her
here
then
he
must
have
carried
her
well
his
arms
looked
strong
enough
to
lift
a
heavier
person
than
herself
but
he
had
brought
her
here
a
faint
colour
stole
into
her
pale
cheeks
thank
you
she
said
at
last
i
suppose
i
was
just
able
to
come
myself
there
was
a
droll
little
pucker
at
the
corner
of
her
mouth
not
exactly
he
answered
as
he
gathered
up
the
dishes
i
remember
that
crazy
little
steed
of
mine
began
to
climb
straight
up
the
side
of
a
terrible
wall
in
the
dark
and
finally
decided
to
wipe
me
off
with
a
tree
that
is
the
last
i
can
recall
i
felt
myself
slipping
and
could
hold
on
any
longer
then
it
all
got
dark
and
i
let
go
where
were
you
going
asked
the
young
man
going
i
was
going
anywhere
said
the
girl
the
pony
was
doing
that
he
was
running
away
i
suppose
he
ran
miles
and
hours
with
me
and
i
could
stop
him
i
lost
hold
on
the
bridle
you
see
and
he
had
ideas
about
what
he
wanted
to
do
i
was
almost
frightened
to
death
and
there
was
a
soul
in
sight
all
day
i
never
saw
such
an
empty
place
in
my
life
it
ca
be
this
is
still
arizona
we
came
so
far
when
did
you
start
the
missionary
questioned
gravely
why
this
morning
that
is
why
it
must
have
been
yesterday
i
sure
i
do
know
when
it
was
wednesday
morning
about
eleven
that
we
left
the
car
on
horseback
to
visit
a
mine
papa
had
heard
about
it
seems
about
a
year
since
we
started
how
many
were
in
your
party
asked
the
young
man
just
papa
and
my
brother
and
hamar
a
friend
of
my
father
answered
the
girl
her
cheeks
reddening
at
the
memory
of
the
name
but
was
there
no
guide
no
native
with
you
at
all
there
was
anxiety
in
the
young
man
tone
he
had
visions
of
other
lost
people
who
would
have
to
be
looked
after
oh
yes
there
was
the
man
my
father
had
written
to
who
brought
the
horses
and
two
or
three
men
with
him
some
of
them
indians
i
think
his
name
was
bunce
bunce
he
was
a
queer
man
with
a
lot
of
wild
looking
hair
shag
bunce
said
the
missionary
thoughtfully
but
if
shag
was
along
i
can
not
understand
how
you
came
to
get
so
widely
separated
from
your
party
he
rides
the
fastest
horse
in
this
region
no
pony
of
his
outfit
be
he
ever
so
fleet
could
get
far
ahead
of
shag
bunce
he
would
have
caught
you
within
a
few
minutes
what
happened
was
there
an
accident
he
looked
at
her
keenly
feeling
sure
there
was
some
mystery
behind
her
wanderings
that
he
ought
to
unravel
for
the
sake
of
the
girl
and
her
friends
hazel
cheeks
grew
rosy
why
nothing
really
happened
she
said
evasively
bunce
was
ahead
with
my
father
in
fact
he
was
out
of
sight
when
my
pony
started
to
run
i
was
riding
with
hamar
and
as
we
did
care
anything
about
the
mine
we
did
hurry
before
we
realized
it
the
others
were
far
ahead
over
a
hill
or
something
i
forget
what
was
ahead
only
they
could
be
seen
then
we
i
that
is
well
i
must
have
touched
my
pony
pretty
hard
with
my
whip
and
he
wheeled
and
started
to
run
i
not
sure
but
i
touched
hamar
horse
too
and
he
was
behaving
badly
i
really
had
time
to
see
i
do
know
what
became
of
hamar
he
is
much
of
a
horseman
i
do
believe
he
had
ever
ridden
before
he
may
have
had
some
trouble
with
his
horse
anyway
before
i
knew
it
i
was
out
of
sight
of
everything
but
wide
empty
stretches
with
mountains
and
clouds
at
the
end
everywhere
and
going
on
and
on
and
not
getting
any
nearer
to
any
thing
this
hamar
must
have
been
a
fool
not
to
have
given
an
alarm
to
your
friends
at
once
if
he
could
do
nothing
himself
said
brownleigh
sternly
i
can
not
understand
how
it
could
happen
that
no
one
found
you
sooner
it
was
the
merest
chance
that
i
came
upon
your
whip
and
other
little
things
and
so
grew
anxious
lest
some
one
was
lost
it
is
very
strange
that
no
one
found
you
before
this
your
father
will
have
been
very
anxious
hazel
sat
up
with
flaming
cheeks
and
began
to
gather
her
hair
in
a
knot
a
sudden
realization
of
her
position
had
come
upon
her
and
given
her
strength
well
you
see
she
stumbled
trying
to
explain
without
telling
anything
hamar
might
have
thought
i
had
gone
back
to
the
car
or
he
might
have
thought
i
would
turn
back
in
a
few
minutes
i
do
not
think
he
would
have
wanted
to
follow
me
just
then
i
was
angry
with
him
the
young
missionary
looked
at
the
beautiful
girl
sitting
upright
on
the
canvas
he
had
spread
for
her
bed
trying
vainly
to
reduce
her
bright
hair
to
something
like
order
her
cheeks
glowing
her
eyes
shining
now
half
with
anger
half
with
embarrassment
and
for
a
second
he
pitied
the
one
who
had
incurred
her
wrath
a
strange
unreasoning
anger
towards
the
unknown
man
took
possession
of
him
and
his
face
grew
tender
as
he
watched
the
girl
that
was
no
excuse
for
letting
you
go
alone
into
the
perils
of
the
desert
he
said
severely
he
could
not
have
known
it
was
impossible
that
he
could
have
understood
or
he
would
have
risked
his
life
to
save
you
from
what
you
have
been
through
no
man
could
do
otherwise
hazel
looked
up
surprised
at
the
vehemence
of
the
words
and
again
the
contrast
between
the
two
men
struck
her
forcibly
i
am
afraid
she
murmured
looking
off
towards
the
distant
mountains
thoughtfully
that
he
is
much
of
a
man
and
somehow
the
young
missionary
was
relieved
to
hear
her
say
so
there
was
a
moment
embarrassed
silence
and
then
brownleigh
began
to
search
in
his
pocket
as
he
saw
the
golden
coil
of
hair
beginning
to
slip
loose
from
its
knot
again
will
these
help
you
any
he
asked
handing
out
the
comb
and
hairpins
he
had
found
a
sudden
awkwardness
coming
upon
him
oh
my
own
comb
she
exclaimed
and
hairpins
where
did
you
find
them
indeed
they
will
help
and
she
seized
upon
them
eagerly
he
turned
away
embarrassed
marvelling
at
the
touch
of
her
fingers
as
she
took
the
bits
of
shell
from
his
hand
no
woman
hand
like
that
had
touched
his
own
even
in
greeting
since
he
bade
to
his
invalid
mother
and
came
out
to
these
wilds
to
do
his
work
it
thrilled
him
to
the
very
soul
and
he
was
minded
of
the
sweet
awe
that
had
come
upon
him
in
his
own
cabin
as
he
looked
upon
the
little
articles
of
woman
toilet
lying
upon
his
table
as
if
they
were
at
home
he
could
not
understand
his
own
mood
it
seemed
like
weakness
he
turned
aside
and
frowned
at
himself
for
his
foolish
sentimentality
towards
a
stranger
whom
he
had
found
upon
the
desert
he
laid
it
to
the
weariness
of
the
long
journey
and
the
sleepless
night
i
found
them
in
the
sand
they
showed
me
the
way
to
find
you
he
said
trying
vainly
to
speak
in
a
commonplace
tone
but
somehow
his
voice
seemed
to
take
on
a
deep
significance
he
looked
at
her
shyly
half
fearing
she
must
feel
it
and
then
murmuring
something
about
looking
after
the
horses
he
hurried
away
when
he
came
back
she
had
mastered
the
rebellious
hair
and
it
lay
shining
and
beautiful
braided
and
coiled
about
her
shapely
head
she
was
standing
now
having
shaken
down
and
smoothed
out
the
rumpled
riding
habit
and
had
made
herself
look
quite
fresh
and
lovely
in
spite
of
the
limited
toilet
conveniences
he
caught
his
breath
as
he
saw
her
the
two
regarded
one
another
intensely
for
just
an
instant
each
startlingly
conscious
of
the
personality
as
men
and
women
will
sometimes
get
a
glimpse
beyond
mere
body
and
sight
the
soul
each
was
aware
of
a
thrilling
pleasure
in
the
presence
of
the
other
it
was
something
new
and
wonderful
that
could
not
be
expressed
nor
even
put
into
thoughts
as
yet
but
something
none
the
less
real
that
flashed
along
their
consciousness
like
the
song
of
the
native
bird
the
scent
of
the
violet
the
breath
of
the
morning
the
instant
of
soul
recognition
passed
and
then
each
recovered
but
it
was
the
woman
who
spoke
first
i
feel
very
much
more
respectable
she
laughed
pleasantly
where
is
my
vicious
little
horse
is
it
time
we
were
getting
back
then
a
cloud
of
anxiety
came
over
the
brightness
of
the
man
face
that
is
what
i
was
coming
to
tell
you
he
said
in
a
troubled
tone
the
wicked
little
beast
has
eaten
off
his
hobble
and
fled
there
a
sight
of
him
to
be
seen
far
or
wide
he
must
have
cleared
out
while
we
were
at
dinner
for
he
was
munching
grass
peaceably
enough
before
you
woke
up
it
was
careless
of
me
not
to
make
him
more
secure
the
hobble
was
an
old
one
and
worn
but
the
best
i
had
i
came
back
to
tell
you
that
i
must
ride
after
him
at
once
you
wo
be
afraid
to
stay
alone
for
a
little
while
will
you
my
horse
has
had
a
rest
i
think
i
ought
to
be
able
to
catch
him
v
the
trail
but
the
look
of
horror
in
the
eyes
of
the
girl
stopped
him
she
gave
a
quick
frightened
glance
around
and
then
her
eyes
besought
him
all
the
terror
of
the
night
alone
in
the
wideness
returned
upon
her
she
heard
again
the
howl
of
the
coyotes
and
saw
the
long
dark
shadows
in
the
canyon
she
was
white
to
the
lips
with
the
thought
of
it
oh
do
leave
me
alone
she
said
trying
to
speak
bravely
i
feel
as
if
i
could
stand
it
there
are
wild
beasts
around
she
glanced
furtively
behind
her
as
if
even
now
one
was
slyly
tracking
her
it
was
awful
awful
their
howls
and
it
is
so
alone
here
i
never
was
alone
before
there
was
that
in
her
appealing
helplessness
that
gave
him
a
wild
desire
to
stoop
and
fold
her
in
his
arms
and
tell
her
he
would
never
leave
her
while
she
wanted
him
the
colour
came
and
went
in
his
fine
bronzed
face
and
his
eyes
grew
tender
with
feeling
i
wo
leave
you
he
said
gently
not
if
you
feel
that
way
though
there
is
really
no
danger
here
in
daytime
the
wild
creatures
are
very
shy
and
only
show
themselves
at
night
but
if
i
do
not
find
your
horse
how
are
you
to
get
speedily
back
to
your
friends
it
is
a
long
distance
you
have
come
and
you
could
not
ride
alone
her
face
grew
troubled
could
i
walk
she
suggested
i
a
good
walker
i
walked
five
miles
at
once
many
a
time
we
are
at
least
forty
miles
from
the
railroad
he
smiled
back
at
her
and
the
road
is
rough
over
a
mountain
by
the
nearest
way
your
horse
must
have
been
determined
indeed
to
take
you
so
far
in
one
day
he
is
evidently
a
new
purchase
of
shag
and
bent
on
returning
to
his
native
heath
horses
do
that
sometimes
it
is
their
instinct
i
tell
you
what
i
do
it
may
be
that
he
has
only
gone
down
in
the
valley
to
the
there
is
one
not
far
away
i
think
i
go
to
the
edge
of
the
mesa
and
get
a
view
if
he
is
not
far
away
you
can
come
with
me
after
him
just
sit
here
and
watch
me
i
not
go
out
of
your
sight
or
hearing
and
i
not
be
gone
five
minutes
you
not
be
afraid
she
sat
down
obediently
where
he
bade
her
her
eyes
large
with
fear
for
she
dreaded
the
loneliness
of
the
desert
more
than
any
fear
that
had
ever
visited
her
before
i
promise
i
not
go
beyond
your
sight
and
call
he
reassured
her
and
with
a
smile
turned
towards
his
own
horse
and
swinging
himself
into
the
saddle
galloped
rapidly
away
to
the
edge
of
the
mesa
she
watched
him
riding
away
her
fears
almost
forgotten
in
her
admiration
of
him
her
heart
beating
strangely
with
the
memory
of
his
smile
the
protection
of
it
seemed
to
linger
behind
him
and
quiet
her
anxiety
he
rode
straight
to
the
east
and
then
more
slowly
turned
and
skirted
the
horizon
riding
north
along
the
edge
of
the
mesa
she
saw
him
shade
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
look
away
in
all
directions
at
last
after
a
prolonged
gaze
straight
north
he
wheeled
his
horse
and
came
quickly
back
to
her
his
face
was
grave
as
he
dismounted
i
sighted
him
he
said
but
it
no
use
he
has
three
or
four
miles
start
and
a
steep
hill
climbed
when
he
reaches
the
top
of
the
next
mesa
he
has
a
straight
course
before
him
and
probably
after
that
it
might
take
me
three
or
four
hours
to
catch
him
and
it
a
question
if
i
could
do
it
then
we
have
to
dismiss
him
from
our
arrangements
and
get
along
with
billy
do
you
feel
equal
to
riding
now
or
ought
you
to
rest
again
oh
i
can
ride
but
i
can
not
take
your
horse
what
will
you
do
i
shall
do
nicely
he
answered
smiling
again
only
our
progress
will
be
slower
than
if
we
had
both
horses
what
a
pity
that
i
had
not
taken
off
his
saddle
it
would
have
been
more
comfortable
for
you
than
this
but
i
was
searching
so
anxiously
for
the
rider
that
i
took
little
heed
to
the
horse
except
to
hastily
hobble
him
and
when
i
found
you
you
needed
all
my
attention
now
i
advise
you
to
lie
down
and
rest
until
i
get
packed
up
it
wo
take
me
long
she
curled
down
obediently
to
rest
until
he
was
ready
to
fold
up
the
canvas
on
which
she
lay
and
watched
his
easy
movements
as
he
put
together
the
few
articles
of
the
pack
and
arranged
the
saddle
for
her
comfort
then
he
strode
over
to
her
with
your
permission
he
said
and
stooping
picked
her
up
lightly
in
his
arms
and
placed
her
on
the
horse
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
but
you
are
not
equal
to
the
exertion
of
mounting
in
the
ordinary
way
you
will
need
every
bit
of
strength
for
the
ride
you
are
weaker
than
you
realize
her
laugh
rippled
out
faintly
you
make
me
feel
like
an
insignificant
baby
i
did
know
what
was
happening
until
you
had
me
here
you
must
have
the
strength
of
a
giant
i
never
felt
so
little
before
you
are
not
a
heavy
burden
he
said
smiling
now
are
you
quite
comfortable
if
so
we
start
billy
arched
his
neck
and
turned
his
head
proudly
to
survey
his
new
rider
a
look
of
friendliness
on
his
bay
face
and
in
his
kindly
eye
oh
is
he
a
beauty
exclaimed
the
girl
reaching
out
a
timid
hand
to
pat
his
neck
the
horse
bowed
and
almost
seemed
to
smile
brownleigh
noticed
the
gleam
of
a
splendid
jewel
on
the
little
hand
billy
is
my
good
friend
and
constant
companion
said
the
missionary
we
faced
some
long
hard
days
together
he
is
wanting
me
to
tell
you
now
that
he
is
proud
to
carry
you
back
to
your
friends
billy
bowed
up
and
down
and
smiled
again
and
hazel
laughed
out
with
pleasure
then
her
face
grew
sober
again
but
you
will
have
to
walk
she
said
i
can
not
take
your
horse
and
let
you
walk
i
wo
do
that
i
going
to
walk
with
you
and
use
up
what
strength
you
have
so
that
you
could
not
even
ride
he
said
pleasantly
no
i
could
allow
that
you
know
and
i
am
pleased
to
walk
with
a
companion
a
missionary
life
is
pretty
lonesome
sometimes
you
know
come
billy
we
must
be
starting
for
we
want
to
make
a
good
ten
miles
before
we
stop
to
rest
if
our
guest
can
stand
the
journey
with
stately
steppings
as
if
he
knew
he
bore
a
princess
billy
started
and
with
long
easy
strides
brownleigh
walked
by
his
side
ever
watchful
of
the
way
and
furtively
observing
the
face
of
the
girl
whose
strength
he
well
knew
must
be
extremely
limited
after
her
ride
of
the
day
before
out
on
the
top
of
the
mesa
looking
off
towards
the
great
mountains
and
the
wide
expanse
of
seemingly
infinite
shades
and
colourings
hazel
drew
her
breath
in
wonder
at
the
beauty
of
the
scene
her
companion
called
her
attention
to
this
and
that
point
of
interest
the
slender
dark
line
across
the
plain
was
mesquite
he
told
her
how
when
once
they
had
entered
it
it
would
seem
to
spread
out
vastly
as
though
it
filled
the
whole
valley
and
that
then
looking
back
the
grassy
slope
below
them
would
seem
to
be
an
insignificant
streak
of
yellow
he
told
her
it
was
always
so
in
this
land
that
the
kind
of
landscape
through
which
one
was
passing
filled
the
whole
view
and
seemed
the
only
thing
in
life
he
said
he
supposed
it
was
so
in
all
our
lives
that
the
immediate
present
filled
the
whole
view
of
the
future
until
we
came
to
something
else
and
the
look
in
his
eyes
made
her
turn
from
the
landscape
and
wonder
about
him
and
his
life
then
he
stooped
and
pointed
to
a
clump
of
soapweed
and
idly
broke
off
a
bit
of
another
bush
handing
it
to
her
the
indians
call
it
weed
that
was
not
scared
he
said
is
it
an
odd
suggestive
name
it
must
be
a
brave
little
weed
indeed
to
live
out
here
all
alone
under
this
terribly
big
sky
i
would
like
it
even
if
i
were
only
a
weed
and
she
looked
around
and
shivered
with
the
thought
of
her
fearful
ride
alone
in
the
night
but
she
tucked
the
little
spray
of
brave
green
into
the
buttonhole
of
her
riding
habit
and
it
looked
of
prouder
lineage
than
any
weed
as
it
rested
against
the
handsome
darkness
of
the
rich
green
cloth
for
an
instant
the
missionary
studied
the
picture
of
the
lovely
girl
on
the
horse
and
forgot
that
he
was
only
a
missionary
then
with
a
start
he
came
to
himself
they
must
be
getting
on
for
the
sun
had
already
passed
its
zenith
and
the
way
was
long
before
them
his
eyes
lingered
wistfully
on
the
gleam
of
her
hair
where
the
sun
touched
it
into
burnished
gold
then
he
remembered
by
the
way
is
this
yours
he
asked
and
brought
out
of
his
pocket
the
little
velvet
cap
oh
where
did
you
find
it
she
cried
settling
it
on
her
head
like
a
touch
of
velvet
in
a
crown
i
dropped
it
in
front
of
a
tiny
little
cabin
when
my
last
hope
vanished
i
called
and
called
but
the
wind
threw
my
voice
back
into
my
throat
and
no
one
came
out
to
answer
me
it
was
my
house
he
said
i
found
it
on
a
a
few
feet
from
my
own
door
would
that
i
had
been
at
home
to
answer
your
call
your
house
she
exclaimed
in
wonder
oh
why
it
could
have
been
it
was
big
enough
for
anybody
not
anybody
like
you
to
live
in
why
it
was
anything
more
than
a
a
shed
just
a
little
board
shanty
exactly
my
shack
he
said
half
apologetically
half
comically
you
should
see
the
inside
it
not
so
bad
as
it
looks
i
only
wish
i
could
take
you
that
way
but
the
fact
is
it
somewhat
out
of
the
way
to
the
railroad
and
we
must
take
the
short
cut
if
we
want
to
shorten
your
father
anxiety
do
you
feel
able
to
go
on
further
now
oh
yes
quite
she
said
with
sudden
trouble
in
her
face
papa
will
be
very
much
worried
and
aunt
maria
oh
aunt
maria
will
be
wild
with
anxiety
she
will
tell
me
that
this
is
just
what
she
expected
from
my
going
out
riding
in
this
heathen
land
she
warned
me
not
to
go
she
said
it
was
ladylike
as
they
went
on
gradually
she
told
him
all
about
her
people
describing
their
little
idiosyncrasies
her
aunt
her
brother
her
father
her
maid
and
even
the
fat
man
cook
the
young
man
soon
had
the
picture
of
the
private
car
with
all
its
luxuries
and
the
story
of
the
days
of
travel
that
had
been
one
long
fairy
tale
of
pleasure
only
the
man
hamar
was
not
mentioned
but
the
missionary
had
not
forgotten
him
somehow
he
had
taken
a
dislike
to
him
from
the
first
mention
of
his
name
he
blamed
him
fiercely
for
not
having
come
after
the
maiden
yet
blessed
the
fortune
that
had
given
himself
that
honour
they
were
descending
into
the
canyon
now
but
not
by
the
steep
trail
up
which
the
pony
had
taken
her
the
night
before
however
it
was
rough
enough
and
the
descent
though
it
was
into
the
very
heart
of
beauty
storehouse
yet
frightened
hazel
she
started
at
every
steep
place
and
clutched
at
the
saddle
wildly
pressing
her
white
teeth
hard
into
her
under
lip
until
it
grew
white
and
tense
her
face
was
white
also
and
a
sudden
faintness
seemed
to
come
upon
her
brownleigh
noticed
instantly
and
walking
close
beside
the
horse
guiding
carefully
his
every
step
he
put
his
free
arm
about
her
to
steady
her
and
bade
her
lean
towards
him
and
not
be
afraid
his
strength
steadied
her
and
gave
her
confidence
and
his
pleasant
voice
pointing
out
the
beauties
of
the
way
helped
her
to
forget
her
fright
he
made
her
look
up
and
showed
her
how
the
great
ferns
were
hanging
over
in
a
fringe
of
green
at
the
top
of
the
bare
rocks
above
their
delicate
lacery
standing
out
like
green
fretwork
against
the
blue
of
the
sky
he
pointed
to
a
cave
in
the
rocks
far
above
and
told
her
of
the
dwellers
of
old
who
had
hollowed
it
out
for
a
home
of
the
stone
axes
and
jars
of
clay
the
corn
mills
and
sandals
woven
of
yucca
that
were
found
there
and
of
other
curious
in
this
part
of
the
country
giving
in
answer
to
her
wondering
questions
much
curious
information
the
like
of
which
she
had
never
heard
before
then
when
they
were
fairly
down
in
the
shadows
of
the
canyon
he
brought
her
a
cooling
draught
of
spring
water
in
the
tin
cup
and
lifting
her
unexpectedly
from
the
horse
made
her
sit
in
a
mossy
spot
where
sweet
flowers
clustered
about
and
rest
for
a
few
minutes
for
he
knew
the
ride
down
the
steep
path
had
been
terribly
trying
to
her
nerves
yet
all
his
attentions
to
her
whether
lifting
her
to
and
from
the
saddle
or
putting
his
arm
about
her
to
support
her
on
the
way
were
performed
with
such
grace
of
courtesy
as
to
remove
all
personality
from
his
touch
and
she
marvelled
at
it
while
she
sat
and
rested
and
watched
him
from
the
distance
watering
billy
at
a
noisy
little
stream
that
chattered
through
the
canyon
he
put
her
on
the
horse
again
and
they
took
their
way
through
the
coolness
and
beauty
of
the
canyon
winding
along
the
edge
of
the
little
stream
threading
their
way
among
the
trees
and
over
boulders
and
rough
places
until
at
last
in
the
late
afternoon
they
came
out
again
upon
the
plain
the
missionary
looked
anxiously
at
the
sun
it
had
taken
longer
to
come
through
the
canyon
than
he
had
anticipated
the
day
was
waning
he
quickened
billy
into
a
trot
and
settled
into
a
long
athletic
run
beside
him
while
the
girl
cheeks
flushed
with
the
exercise
and
wind
and
her
admiration
of
her
escort
grew
but
are
you
very
tired
she
asked
at
last
when
he
slowed
down
and
made
billy
walk
again
billy
by
the
way
had
enjoyed
the
race
immensely
he
thought
he
was
having
a
grand
time
with
a
princess
on
his
back
and
his
beloved
master
keeping
pace
with
him
he
was
confident
by
this
time
that
they
were
bringing
the
princess
home
to
be
there
to
welcome
them
on
all
returns
hereafter
his
had
jumped
to
a
conclusion
and
approved
most
heartily
tired
answered
brownleigh
and
laughed
not
consciously
i
good
for
several
miles
yet
myself
i
have
had
such
a
good
time
in
three
years
not
since
i
left
home
and
mother
he
added
softly
reverently
there
was
a
look
in
his
eyes
that
made
the
girl
long
to
know
more
she
watched
him
keenly
and
asked
oh
then
you
have
a
mother
yes
i
have
a
mother
a
wonderful
mother
he
breathed
the
words
like
a
blessing
the
girl
looked
at
him
in
awe
she
had
no
mother
her
own
had
died
before
she
could
remember
aunt
maria
was
her
only
idea
of
mothers
is
she
out
here
she
asked
no
she
is
at
home
up
in
new
hampshire
in
a
little
quiet
country
town
but
she
is
a
wonderful
mother
and
have
you
no
one
else
no
other
family
out
here
with
you
hazel
did
not
realize
how
anxiously
she
awaited
the
answer
to
that
question
somehow
she
felt
a
jealous
dislike
of
any
one
who
might
belong
to
him
even
a
mother
and
a
sudden
thought
of
sister
or
wife
who
might
share
the
little
shanty
cabin
with
him
made
her
watch
his
face
narrowly
but
the
answer
was
quick
with
almost
a
shadow
like
deep
longing
on
his
face
oh
no
i
have
no
one
i
all
alone
and
sometimes
if
it
were
not
for
mother
letters
it
would
seem
a
great
way
from
home
the
girl
did
not
know
why
it
was
so
pleasant
to
know
this
and
why
her
heart
went
out
in
instant
sympathy
for
him
she
said
gently
tell
me
about
your
mother
please
and
so
he
told
her
as
he
walked
beside
her
of
his
invalid
mother
whose
frail
body
and
its
needs
bound
her
to
a
couch
in
her
old
new
england
home
helpless
and
carefully
tended
by
a
devoted
nurse
whom
she
loved
and
who
loved
her
her
great
spirit
had
risen
to
the
sacrifice
of
sending
her
only
son
out
to
the
desert
on
his
chosen
commission
they
had
been
climbing
a
long
sloping
hill
and
at
the
climax
of
the
story
had
reached
the
top
and
could
look
abroad
again
over
a
wide
expanse
of
country
it
seemed
to
hazel
city
bred
eyes
as
though
the
kingdoms
of
the
whole
world
lay
spread
before
her
awed
gaze
a
brilliant
sunset
was
spreading
a
great
silver
light
behind
the
purple
mountains
in
the
west
red
and
blue
in
flaming
lavishness
with
billows
of
white
clouds
floating
above
and
over
that
in
sharp
contrast
the
sky
was
velvet
black
with
storm
to
the
south
the
rain
was
falling
in
a
brilliant
shower
like
yellow
gold
and
to
the
east
two
more
patches
of
rain
were
rosy
pink
as
petals
of
some
wondrous
flowers
and
arching
over
them
a
half
rainbow
turning
slightly
towards
the
north
one
saw
the
rain
falling
from
dark
blue
clouds
in
great
streaks
of
white
light
breathed
the
girl
how
wonderful
i
never
saw
anything
like
that
before
but
the
missionary
had
no
time
for
answer
he
began
quickly
to
unstrap
the
canvas
from
behind
the
saddle
watching
the
clouds
as
he
did
so
we
are
going
to
get
a
wetting
i
afraid
he
said
and
looked
anxiously
at
his
companion
vi
camp
it
came
indeed
before
he
was
quite
ready
for
it
but
he
managed
to
throw
the
canvas
over
horse
and
lady
bidding
her
hold
it
on
one
side
while
he
standing
close
under
the
extemporized
tent
held
the
other
side
leaving
an
opening
in
front
for
air
and
so
they
managed
to
keep
tolerably
dry
while
two
storms
met
overhead
and
poured
down
a
torrent
upon
them
the
girl
laughed
out
merrily
as
the
first
great
splashes
struck
her
face
then
retreated
into
the
shelter
as
she
was
bidden
and
sat
quietly
watching
and
wondering
over
it
all
here
was
she
a
carefully
nurtured
daughter
of
society
until
now
never
daring
to
step
one
inch
beyond
the
line
of
conventionality
sitting
afar
from
all
her
friends
and
kindred
on
a
wide
desert
plain
under
a
bit
of
canvas
with
a
strange
missionary
arm
about
her
and
sitting
as
securely
and
contentedly
nay
happily
as
if
she
had
been
in
her
own
cushioned
chair
in
her
new
york
boudoir
it
is
true
the
arm
was
about
her
for
the
purpose
of
holding
down
the
canvas
and
keeping
out
the
rain
but
there
was
a
wonderful
security
and
sense
of
strength
in
it
that
filled
her
with
a
strange
new
joy
and
made
her
wish
that
the
elements
of
the
universe
might
continue
to
rage
in
brilliant
display
about
her
head
a
little
longer
if
thereby
she
might
continue
to
feel
the
strength
of
that
fine
presence
near
her
and
about
her
a
great
weariness
was
upon
her
and
this
was
rest
and
content
so
she
put
all
other
thoughts
out
of
her
mind
for
the
time
and
rested
back
against
the
strong
arm
in
full
realization
of
her
safety
amidst
the
disturbance
of
the
elements
the
missionary
wore
his
upward
look
no
word
passed
between
them
as
the
panorama
of
the
storm
swept
by
only
god
knew
what
was
passing
in
his
soul
and
how
out
of
that
dear
nearness
of
the
beautiful
girl
a
great
longing
was
born
to
have
her
always
near
him
his
right
to
ever
protect
her
from
the
storms
of
life
but
he
was
a
man
of
marked
he
held
even
his
thoughts
in
obedience
to
a
higher
power
and
while
the
wild
wish
of
his
heart
swept
exquisitely
over
him
he
stood
calmly
and
handed
it
back
to
heaven
as
though
he
knew
it
were
a
wandering
wish
a
testing
of
his
true
self
at
the
first
instant
of
relief
from
necessity
he
took
his
arm
away
he
did
not
presume
a
single
second
to
hold
the
canvas
after
the
wind
had
subsided
and
she
liked
him
the
better
for
it
and
felt
her
trust
in
him
grow
deeper
as
he
gently
shook
the
raindrops
from
their
temporary
shelter
the
rain
had
lasted
but
a
few
minutes
and
as
the
clouds
cleared
the
earth
grew
lighter
for
a
space
gently
melting
into
the
silver
and
amethyst
and
emerald
of
the
sky
the
rainbow
faded
and
now
they
hurried
on
for
brownleigh
wished
to
reach
a
certain
spot
where
he
hoped
to
find
dry
shelter
for
the
night
he
saw
that
the
excitement
of
travel
and
the
storm
had
sorely
spent
the
strength
of
the
girl
and
that
she
needed
rest
so
he
urged
the
horse
forward
and
hurried
along
by
his
side
but
suddenly
he
halted
the
horse
and
looked
keenly
into
the
face
of
his
companion
in
the
dying
light
you
are
very
tired
he
said
you
can
hardly
sit
up
any
longer
she
smiled
faintly
her
whole
body
was
drooping
with
weariness
and
a
strange
sick
faintness
had
come
upon
her
we
must
stop
here
he
said
and
cast
about
him
for
a
suitable
spot
well
this
will
do
here
is
a
dry
place
the
shelter
of
that
big
rock
the
rain
was
from
the
other
direction
and
the
ground
around
here
did
not
even
get
sprinkled
that
group
of
trees
will
do
for
a
private
room
for
you
we
soon
have
a
fire
and
some
supper
and
then
you
feel
better
with
that
he
stripped
off
his
coat
and
spreading
it
upon
the
ground
in
the
dry
shelter
of
a
great
rock
lifted
the
drooping
girl
from
the
saddle
and
laid
her
gently
on
the
coat
she
closed
her
eyes
wearily
and
sank
back
in
truth
she
was
nearer
to
fainting
than
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
and
the
young
man
hastened
to
administer
a
restorative
which
brought
the
colour
back
to
her
pale
cheeks
it
is
nothing
she
murmured
opening
her
eyes
and
trying
to
smile
i
was
just
tired
and
my
back
ached
with
so
much
riding
do
talk
he
said
gently
i
give
you
something
to
hearten
you
up
in
a
minute
he
quickly
gathered
sticks
and
soon
had
a
blazing
fire
not
far
from
where
she
lay
and
the
glow
of
it
played
over
her
face
and
her
golden
hair
while
he
prepared
a
second
cup
of
beef
extract
and
blessed
the
fortune
that
had
made
him
fill
his
canteen
with
water
at
the
spring
in
the
canyon
for
water
might
not
be
very
near
and
he
felt
that
to
have
to
move
the
girl
further
along
that
night
would
be
a
disaster
he
could
see
that
she
was
about
used
up
but
while
he
was
making
preparations
for
supper
billy
who
was
hobbled
but
entirely
able
to
edge
about
slowly
had
discovered
a
for
himself
and
settled
that
difficulty
brownleigh
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
and
smiled
happily
as
he
saw
his
patient
revive
under
the
influence
of
the
hot
drink
and
a
few
rest
i
quite
able
to
go
on
a
little
further
she
said
sitting
up
with
an
effort
if
you
think
we
should
go
further
i
really
do
feel
bad
at
all
any
more
he
smiled
with
relief
i
so
glad
he
said
i
was
afraid
i
had
made
you
travel
too
far
no
we
not
go
further
till
daylight
i
think
this
is
as
good
a
place
to
camp
as
any
and
water
not
far
away
you
will
find
your
boudoir
just
inside
that
group
of
trees
and
in
half
an
hour
or
so
the
canvas
will
be
quite
dry
for
your
bed
i
got
it
spread
out
you
see
close
to
the
fire
on
the
other
side
there
and
it
was
wet
through
the
blanket
was
sheltered
it
will
be
warm
and
dry
i
think
we
can
make
you
comfortable
have
you
ever
slept
out
under
the
stars
before
that
is
of
course
with
the
exception
of
last
night
i
do
suppose
you
really
enjoyed
that
experience
hazel
shuddered
at
the
thought
i
do
remember
much
only
awful
darkness
and
howling
will
those
creatures
come
this
way
do
you
think
i
feel
as
if
i
should
die
with
fright
if
i
have
to
hear
them
again
you
may
hear
them
in
the
distance
but
not
nearby
he
answered
reassuringly
they
do
not
like
the
fire
they
will
not
come
near
nor
disturb
you
besides
i
shall
be
close
at
hand
all
night
i
am
used
to
listening
and
waking
in
the
night
i
shall
keep
a
bright
fire
blazing
but
you
you
what
will
you
do
you
are
planning
to
give
me
the
canvas
and
the
blanket
and
stay
awake
yourself
keeping
watch
you
have
walked
all
day
while
i
have
ridden
and
you
have
been
nurse
and
cook
as
well
while
i
have
been
good
for
nothing
and
now
you
want
me
to
rest
comfortably
all
night
while
you
sit
up
there
was
a
ring
in
the
young
man
voice
as
he
answered
her
that
thrilled
her
to
the
heart
i
shall
be
all
right
he
said
and
his
voice
was
positively
joyous
and
i
shall
have
the
greatest
night
of
my
life
taking
care
of
you
i
count
it
a
privilege
many
a
night
have
i
slept
alone
under
the
stars
with
no
one
to
guard
and
felt
the
loneliness
now
i
shall
always
have
this
to
remember
besides
i
shall
not
sit
up
i
am
used
to
throwing
myself
down
anywhere
my
clothing
is
warm
and
my
saddle
is
used
to
acting
as
a
pillow
i
shall
sleep
and
rest
and
yet
be
always
on
the
alert
to
keep
up
the
fire
and
hear
any
sound
that
comes
near
he
talked
as
though
he
were
recounting
the
plan
of
some
delightful
recreation
and
the
girl
lay
and
watched
his
handsome
face
in
the
play
of
the
firelight
and
rejoiced
in
it
somehow
there
was
something
very
sweet
in
companionship
alone
in
the
vast
silence
with
this
stranger
friend
she
found
herself
glad
of
the
wideness
of
the
desert
and
the
stillness
of
the
night
that
shut
out
the
world
and
made
their
most
unusual
relationship
possible
for
a
little
while
a
great
longing
possessed
her
to
know
more
and
understand
better
the
fine
personality
of
this
man
who
was
a
man
among
men
she
was
convinced
suddenly
as
he
came
and
sat
down
by
the
fire
not
far
from
her
after
attending
to
the
few
supper
dishes
she
burst
forth
with
a
question
why
did
you
do
it
he
turned
to
her
eyes
that
were
filled
with
a
deep
content
and
asked
do
what
come
here
be
a
missionary
why
did
you
do
it
you
are
fitted
for
better
things
you
could
fill
a
large
city
church
or
even
do
other
things
in
the
world
why
did
you
do
it
the
firelight
flickered
on
his
face
and
showed
his
features
fine
and
strong
in
an
expression
of
deep
feeling
that
gave
it
an
exalted
look
there
seemed
a
light
in
his
eyes
that
was
more
than
firelight
as
he
raised
them
upward
in
a
swift
glance
and
said
quietly
as
though
it
were
the
simplest
matter
in
the
universe
because
my
father
called
me
to
this
work
and
i
doubt
if
there
can
be
any
better
listen
and
then
he
told
her
of
his
work
while
the
fire
burned
cheerfully
and
the
dusk
grew
deeper
till
the
moon
showed
clear
her
silver
orb
riding
high
in
starry
heavens
the
mournful
voice
of
the
coyotes
echoed
distantly
but
the
girl
was
not
frightened
for
her
thoughts
were
held
by
the
story
of
the
strange
childlike
race
for
whom
this
man
among
men
was
giving
his
life
he
told
her
of
the
indian
hogans
little
round
huts
built
of
logs
on
end
and
slanting
to
a
common
centre
thatched
with
turf
and
straw
an
opening
for
a
door
and
another
in
the
top
to
let
out
the
smoke
of
the
fire
a
dirt
floor
no
furniture
but
a
few
blankets
sheepskins
and
some
tin
dishes
he
carried
her
in
imagination
to
one
such
hogan
where
lay
the
little
dying
indian
maiden
and
made
the
picture
of
their
barren
lives
so
vivid
that
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
as
she
listened
he
told
of
the
the
ignorance
and
superstition
the
snake
dances
and
heathen
rites
the
wild
poetic
conservative
man
of
the
desert
with
his
distrust
his
great
loving
heart
his
broken
hopes
and
blind
aspirations
until
hazel
began
to
see
that
he
really
loved
them
that
he
had
seen
the
possibility
of
greatness
in
them
and
longed
to
help
develop
it
he
told
her
of
the
sabbath
just
past
when
in
company
with
his
distant
neighbour
missionary
he
had
gone
on
an
evangelistic
tour
among
the
tribes
far
away
from
the
mission
station
he
pictured
the
indians
sitting
on
rocks
and
stones
amid
the
long
shadows
of
the
cedar
trees
just
before
the
sundown
listening
to
a
sermon
he
had
reminded
them
of
their
indian
god
begochiddi
and
of
nilhchii
whom
the
indians
believe
to
have
made
all
things
the
same
whom
white
men
call
god
and
showed
them
a
book
called
the
bible
which
told
the
story
of
god
and
of
jesus
his
son
who
came
to
save
men
from
their
sin
not
one
of
the
indians
had
ever
heard
the
name
of
jesus
before
nor
knew
anything
of
the
great
story
of
salvation
hazel
found
herself
wondering
why
it
made
so
very
much
difference
whether
these
poor
ignorant
creatures
knew
all
this
or
not
and
yet
she
saw
from
the
face
of
the
man
before
her
that
it
did
matter
infinitely
to
him
it
mattered
more
than
anything
else
a
passing
wish
that
she
were
an
indian
to
thus
hold
his
interest
flashed
through
her
mind
but
he
was
speaking
yet
of
his
work
and
his
rapt
look
filled
her
with
awe
she
was
overwhelmed
with
the
greatness
and
the
fineness
of
the
man
before
her
sitting
there
in
the
fitful
firelight
with
its
ruddy
glow
upon
his
face
his
hat
off
and
the
moon
laying
a
silver
crown
upon
his
head
he
seemed
half
angel
half
god
she
had
never
before
been
so
filled
with
the
joy
of
beholding
another
soul
she
had
no
room
for
thoughts
of
anything
else
then
suddenly
he
remembered
that
it
was
late
i
have
kept
you
awake
far
too
long
he
said
penitently
looking
at
her
with
a
smile
that
seemed
all
tenderness
we
ought
to
get
on
our
way
as
soon
as
it
is
light
and
i
have
made
you
listen
to
me
when
you
ought
to
have
been
sleeping
but
i
always
like
to
have
a
word
with
my
father
before
retiring
shall
we
have
our
worship
together
hazel
overcome
by
wonder
and
embarrassment
assented
and
lay
still
in
her
sheltered
spot
watching
him
as
he
drew
a
small
leather
book
from
his
breast
pocket
and
opened
to
the
place
marked
by
a
tiny
silken
cord
then
stirring
up
the
fire
to
brightness
he
began
to
read
and
the
majestic
words
of
the
psalm
came
to
her
unaccustomed
ears
as
a
charmed
page
he
that
dwelleth
in
the
secret
place
of
the
most
high
shall
abide
under
the
shadow
of
the
almighty
he
shall
cover
thee
with
his
feathers
and
under
his
wings
shalt
thou
trust
the
words
were
uttered
with
a
ringing
tone
of
trust
the
listener
knew
little
of
birds
and
their
ways
but
the
phrasing
reminded
her
of
the
way
she
had
been
sheltered
from
the
storm
a
little
while
before
and
her
heart
thrilled
anew
with
the
thought
of
it
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
for
the
terror
by
night
ah
terror
by
night
she
knew
what
that
meant
that
awful
night
of
darkness
steep
riding
howling
beasts
and
black
oblivion
she
shuddered
involuntarily
at
the
remembrance
not
afraid
what
confidence
the
voice
had
as
it
rang
on
and
all
at
once
she
knew
that
this
night
was
free
from
terror
for
her
because
of
the
man
whose
confidence
was
in
the
unseen
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
over
thee
and
looking
at
him
she
half
expected
to
see
flitting
wings
in
the
moonlit
background
how
strong
and
true
the
face
how
tender
the
lines
about
the
mouth
what
a
glow
of
inner
quietness
and
power
in
the
eyes
as
he
raised
them
now
and
again
to
her
face
across
the
firelight
what
a
thing
it
would
be
to
have
a
friend
like
that
always
to
guard
one
her
eyes
glowed
softly
at
the
thought
and
once
again
there
flashed
across
her
mind
the
contrast
between
this
man
and
the
one
from
whom
she
had
fled
in
horror
the
day
before
the
reading
ended
he
replaced
the
little
marker
and
dropping
upon
one
knee
on
the
desert
with
his
face
lifted
to
the
sky
and
all
the
radiance
of
the
moon
flooding
over
him
he
spoke
to
god
as
a
man
speaks
with
his
friend
face
to
face
hazel
lay
with
open
wondering
eyes
and
watched
him
awe
growing
within
her
the
sense
of
an
unseen
presence
close
at
hand
was
so
strong
that
once
she
lifted
half
frightened
eyes
to
the
wide
clear
sky
the
light
on
the
face
of
the
missionary
seemed
like
glory
from
another
world
she
felt
herself
enfolded
and
upborne
into
the
presence
of
the
infinite
by
his
words
and
he
did
not
forget
to
commend
her
loved
ones
to
the
care
of
the
almighty
a
great
peace
came
upon
her
as
she
listened
to
the
simple
earnest
words
and
a
sense
of
security
such
as
she
had
never
known
before
after
the
brief
prayer
he
turned
to
her
with
a
smile
and
a
few
words
of
assurance
about
the
night
there
was
her
behind
those
trees
and
she
need
not
be
afraid
he
would
not
be
far
away
he
would
keep
the
fire
bright
all
night
so
that
she
would
not
be
annoyed
by
the
near
howling
of
the
coyotes
then
he
moved
away
to
gather
more
wood
and
she
heard
him
singing
softly
at
first
and
then
gathering
volume
as
he
got
further
away
his
rich
tenor
voice
ringing
clear
upon
the
night
in
an
old
hymn
the
words
floated
back
distinctly
to
her
listening
ears
my
god
is
any
hour
so
sweet
from
flush
of
dawn
to
evening
star
as
that
which
calls
me
to
thy
feet
the
hour
of
prayer
then
is
my
strength
by
thee
renewed
then
are
my
sins
by
thee
forgiven
then
dost
thou
cheer
my
solitude
with
hopes
of
heaven
no
words
can
tell
what
sweet
relief
there
for
my
every
want
i
find
what
strength
for
warfare
balm
for
grief
what
peace
of
mind
she
lay
down
for
the
night
marvelling
still
over
the
man
he
was
singing
those
words
as
if
he
meant
every
one
and
she
knew
that
he
possessed
something
that
made
him
different
from
other
men
what
was
it
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
the
one
man
of
all
the
earth
and
how
was
it
that
she
had
found
him
away
out
here
alone
in
the
desert
the
great
stars
burned
sharply
in
the
heavens
over
her
the
white
radiance
of
the
moon
lay
all
about
her
the
firelight
played
at
her
feet
far
away
she
could
hear
the
howling
of
the
coyotes
but
she
was
not
afraid
she
could
see
the
broad
shoulders
of
the
man
as
he
stooped
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
to
throw
on
more
wood
presently
she
knew
he
had
thrown
himself
down
with
his
head
on
the
saddle
but
she
could
hear
him
still
humming
softly
something
that
sounded
like
a
lullaby
when
the
firelight
flared
up
it
showed
his
fine
profile
not
far
away
she
could
hear
billy
cropping
the
grass
and
throughout
the
vast
open
universe
there
seemed
to
brood
a
great
and
peaceful
silence
she
was
very
tired
and
her
eyelids
drooped
shut
the
last
thing
she
remembered
was
a
line
he
had
read
from
the
little
book
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
and
she
wondered
if
they
were
somewhere
about
now
that
was
all
until
she
awoke
suddenly
with
the
consciousness
that
she
was
alone
and
that
in
the
near
distance
a
conversation
in
a
low
tone
was
being
carried
on
vii
revelation
the
moon
was
gone
and
the
luminous
silver
atmosphere
was
turned
into
a
clear
dark
blue
with
shadows
of
the
blackness
of
velvet
but
the
stars
burned
redder
now
and
nearer
to
the
earth
the
fire
still
flickered
brightly
with
a
glow
the
moon
had
paled
before
she
went
to
sleep
but
there
was
no
protecting
figure
on
the
other
side
of
the
flames
and
the
angels
seemed
all
to
have
forgotten
off
at
a
little
distance
where
a
group
of
made
dense
darkness
she
heard
the
talking
one
speaking
in
low
tones
now
pleading
now
explaining
deeply
earnest
with
a
mingling
of
anxiety
and
trouble
she
could
not
hear
any
words
she
seemed
to
know
the
voice
was
low
that
she
might
not
hear
yet
it
filled
her
with
a
great
fear
what
had
happened
had
some
one
come
to
harm
them
and
was
he
pleading
for
her
life
strange
to
say
it
never
entered
her
head
to
doubt
his
loyalty
stranger
though
he
was
her
only
feeling
was
that
he
might
have
been
overpowered
in
his
sleep
and
be
even
now
in
need
of
help
himself
what
could
she
do
after
the
first
instant
of
frozen
horror
she
was
on
the
alert
he
had
saved
her
she
must
help
him
she
could
not
hear
any
other
voice
than
his
probably
the
enemy
spoke
in
whispers
but
she
knew
that
she
must
go
at
once
and
find
out
what
was
the
matter
the
distance
from
her
pleasant
couch
beside
the
fire
was
but
a
few
steps
yet
it
seemed
to
her
frightened
heart
and
trembling
limbs
as
she
crept
softly
over
towards
the
that
it
was
miles
at
last
she
was
close
to
the
bush
could
part
it
with
her
cold
hand
and
look
into
the
little
shelter
there
was
a
faint
light
in
the
east
beyond
the
mountains
that
showed
the
coming
dawn
and
silhouetted
against
this
she
saw
the
figure
of
her
rescuer
dropped
upon
one
knee
his
elbow
on
the
other
and
his
face
bowed
in
his
hand
she
could
hear
his
words
distinctly
now
but
there
was
no
man
else
present
though
she
searched
the
darkness
carefully
i
found
her
lost
out
here
in
the
wilderness
he
was
saying
in
low
earnest
tones
so
beautiful
so
dear
but
i
know
she
can
not
be
for
me
her
life
has
been
all
luxury
and
i
would
not
be
a
man
to
ask
her
to
share
the
desert
i
know
too
that
she
is
not
fitted
for
the
work
i
know
it
would
be
all
wrong
and
i
must
not
wish
it
but
i
love
her
though
i
may
not
tell
her
so
i
must
be
resolute
and
strong
and
not
show
her
what
i
feel
i
must
face
my
gethsemane
for
this
girl
is
as
dear
to
me
as
my
own
soul
god
bless
and
guard
her
for
i
may
not
the
girl
had
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
unable
to
move
as
the
low
voice
went
on
with
its
revelation
but
when
the
plea
for
a
blessing
upon
her
came
with
all
the
mighty
longing
of
a
soul
who
loved
absorbingly
it
was
as
if
she
were
unable
to
bear
it
and
she
turned
and
fled
silently
back
to
her
couch
creeping
under
the
canvas
thrilled
frightened
shamed
and
glad
all
in
one
she
closed
her
eyes
and
the
swift
tears
of
joy
came
he
loved
her
he
loved
her
how
the
thought
thrilled
her
how
her
own
heart
leaped
up
to
meet
his
love
the
fact
of
it
was
all
she
could
contain
for
the
time
and
it
filled
her
with
an
ecstasy
such
as
she
had
never
known
before
she
opened
her
eyes
to
the
stars
and
they
shone
back
a
great
radiance
of
joy
to
her
the
quiet
darkness
of
the
vast
earth
all
about
her
seemed
suddenly
to
have
become
the
sweetest
spot
she
had
known
she
had
never
thought
there
could
be
joy
like
this
gradually
she
quieted
the
wild
throbbing
of
her
heart
and
tried
to
set
her
thoughts
in
order
perhaps
she
was
taking
too
much
for
granted
perhaps
he
was
talking
of
another
girl
some
one
he
had
met
the
day
before
but
yet
it
seemed
as
if
there
could
be
no
doubt
there
would
not
be
two
girls
lost
out
in
that
desert
there
could
not
and
her
heart
told
her
that
he
loved
her
could
she
trust
her
heart
oh
the
dearness
of
it
if
it
were
true
her
face
was
burning
too
with
the
sweet
shame
of
having
heard
what
was
not
meant
for
her
ears
then
came
the
flash
of
pain
in
the
joy
he
did
not
intend
to
tell
her
he
meant
to
hide
his
love
and
for
her
sake
and
he
was
great
enough
to
do
so
the
man
who
could
sacrifice
the
things
that
other
men
hold
dear
to
come
out
to
the
wilderness
for
the
sake
of
a
forgotten
people
could
sacrifice
anything
for
what
he
considered
right
this
fact
loomed
like
a
wall
of
adamant
across
the
lovely
way
that
joy
had
revealed
to
her
her
heart
fell
with
the
thought
that
he
was
not
to
speak
of
this
to
her
and
she
knew
that
more
than
for
anything
else
in
life
more
than
anything
she
had
ever
known
she
longed
to
hear
him
speak
those
words
to
her
a
half
resentment
filled
her
that
he
had
told
his
secret
to
another
what
concerned
her
and
would
not
let
her
know
the
heart
searching
went
on
and
now
she
came
to
the
of
the
whole
revelation
there
had
been
another
reason
besides
care
for
herself
why
he
could
not
tell
her
of
his
love
why
he
could
not
ask
her
to
share
his
life
she
had
not
been
accounted
worthy
he
had
put
it
in
pleasant
words
and
said
she
was
unfitted
but
he
might
as
well
have
made
it
plain
and
said
how
useless
she
would
be
in
his
life
the
tears
came
now
tears
of
mortification
for
hazel
radcliffe
had
never
before
in
all
her
petted
life
been
accounted
unworthy
for
any
position
it
was
not
that
she
considered
at
all
the
possibility
of
accepting
the
position
that
was
not
to
be
offered
her
her
startled
mind
had
not
even
reached
so
far
but
her
pride
was
hurt
to
think
that
any
one
should
think
her
unworthy
then
over
the
whole
tumultuous
state
of
mind
would
come
the
memory
of
his
voice
throbbing
with
feeling
as
he
said
she
is
dear
to
me
as
my
own
soul
and
the
joy
of
it
would
sweep
everything
else
away
there
was
no
more
sleep
to
be
had
for
her
the
stars
grew
pale
and
the
rose
dawn
grew
in
the
east
she
presently
heard
her
companion
return
and
replenish
the
fire
stirring
about
softly
among
the
dishes
and
move
away
again
but
she
had
turned
her
head
away
that
he
might
not
see
her
face
and
he
evidently
thought
her
still
sleeping
so
she
lay
and
tried
to
reason
things
out
tried
to
scold
herself
for
thinking
his
words
applied
to
her
tried
to
recall
her
city
life
and
friends
and
how
utterly
alien
this
man
and
his
work
would
be
to
them
tried
to
think
of
the
new
day
when
she
would
probably
reach
her
friends
again
and
this
new
friend
would
be
lost
sight
of
felt
a
sharp
twinge
of
pain
at
the
thought
wondered
if
she
could
meet
milton
hamar
and
what
they
would
say
to
one
another
and
if
any
sort
of
comfortable
relations
could
ever
be
established
between
them
again
and
knew
they
could
not
once
again
the
great
horror
rolled
over
her
at
thought
of
his
kiss
then
came
the
startling
thought
that
he
had
used
almost
the
same
words
to
her
that
this
man
of
the
desert
had
used
about
her
and
yet
how
infinitely
different
how
tender
and
deep
and
true
and
pure
and
high
his
face
in
contrast
to
the
look
she
had
seen
upon
that
handsome
evil
face
bent
over
her
she
covered
her
eyes
and
shuddered
again
and
entertained
a
fleeting
wish
that
she
might
stay
forever
here
and
not
return
to
his
hated
presence
then
back
like
a
of
sunshine
would
come
the
thought
of
the
missionary
and
his
love
for
her
and
everything
else
would
be
obliterated
in
the
rapture
it
brought
and
thus
on
rosy
wings
the
morning
dawned
a
clean
straight
sunrise
hazel
could
hear
the
missionary
stepping
softly
here
and
there
preparing
breakfast
and
knew
he
felt
it
time
to
be
on
the
move
she
must
bestir
herself
and
speak
but
her
cheeks
grew
pink
over
the
thought
of
it
she
kept
waiting
and
trying
to
think
how
to
say
without
a
look
of
guilty
knowledge
in
her
eyes
presently
she
heard
him
call
to
billy
and
move
away
in
the
direction
where
the
horse
was
eating
his
breakfast
then
snatching
her
opportunity
she
slipped
from
under
the
canvas
into
her
green
boudoir
but
even
here
she
found
evidences
of
her
wise
guide
care
for
standing
in
front
of
the
largest
cedar
were
two
tin
cups
of
clear
water
and
beside
them
a
small
pocket
and
a
clean
folded
handkerchief
fine
and
white
he
had
done
his
best
to
supply
her
with
toilet
articles
her
heart
leaped
up
again
at
his
thoughtfulness
she
dashed
the
water
into
her
glowing
face
and
buried
it
in
the
clean
folds
of
the
handkerchief
his
handkerchief
how
wonderful
that
it
should
be
so
how
had
a
mere
commonplace
bit
of
linen
become
so
invested
with
the
currents
of
life
as
to
give
such
joyful
refreshment
with
a
touch
the
wonder
of
it
all
was
like
a
miracle
she
had
not
known
anything
in
life
could
be
like
that
the
great
red
cliff
across
the
valley
was
touched
with
the
morning
sun
when
she
emerged
from
her
green
shelter
shyly
conscious
of
the
secret
that
lay
unrevealed
between
them
their
little
camp
was
still
in
the
shadow
the
last
star
had
disappeared
as
if
a
hand
had
turned
the
lights
low
with
a
flash
and
revealed
the
morning
she
stood
for
an
instant
in
the
parting
of
the
cedars
a
hand
on
each
side
holding
back
the
boughs
looking
forth
from
her
retreat
and
the
man
advancing
saw
her
and
waited
with
bared
head
to
do
her
reverence
a
great
light
of
love
in
his
eyes
which
he
knew
not
was
visible
but
which
blinded
the
eyes
of
the
watching
girl
and
made
her
cheeks
grow
rosier
the
very
air
about
them
seemed
charged
with
an
electrical
current
the
little
commonplaces
which
they
spoke
sank
deep
into
the
heart
of
each
and
lingered
to
bless
the
future
the
glances
of
their
eyes
had
many
meetings
and
lingered
shyly
on
more
intimate
ground
than
the
day
before
yet
each
had
grown
more
silent
the
tenderness
of
his
voice
was
like
a
benediction
as
he
greeted
her
he
seated
her
on
the
canvas
he
had
arranged
freshly
beside
a
bit
of
green
grass
and
prepared
to
serve
her
like
a
queen
indeed
she
wore
a
queenly
bearing
small
and
slender
though
she
was
her
golden
hair
shining
in
the
morning
and
her
eyes
bright
as
the
stars
that
had
just
been
paled
by
day
there
were
fried
rabbits
cooking
in
the
tiny
saucepan
and
corn
bread
was
toasting
before
the
fire
on
two
sharp
sticks
she
found
to
her
surprise
that
she
was
hungry
and
that
the
breakfast
he
had
prepared
seemed
a
most
delicious
feast
she
grew
secure
in
her
consciousness
that
he
did
not
know
she
had
guessed
his
secret
and
let
the
joy
of
it
all
flow
over
her
and
envelop
her
her
laugh
rang
out
musically
over
the
plain
and
he
watched
her
hungrily
delightedly
enjoying
every
minute
of
the
companionship
with
a
kind
of
double
joy
because
of
the
barren
days
that
he
was
sure
were
to
come
finally
he
broke
away
from
the
pleasant
lingering
with
an
exclamation
for
the
sun
was
hastening
upward
and
it
was
time
they
were
on
their
way
hastily
he
packed
away
the
things
she
trying
in
her
bungling
unaccustomedness
to
help
and
only
giving
sweet
hindrance
with
the
little
white
hands
that
thrilled
him
so
wonderfully
as
they
came
near
with
a
plate
or
a
cup
or
a
bit
of
corn
bread
that
had
been
left
out
he
put
her
on
the
horse
and
they
started
on
their
way
yet
not
once
in
all
the
pleasant
contact
had
he
betrayed
his
secret
and
hazel
began
to
feel
the
burden
of
what
she
had
found
out
weighing
guiltily
upon
her
like
a
thing
stolen
which
she
would
gladly
replace
but
dared
not
sometimes
as
they
rode
along
he
quietly
talking
as
the
day
before
pointing
out
some
object
of
interest
or
telling
her
some
remarkable
story
of
his
experiences
she
would
wonder
if
she
had
not
been
entirely
mistaken
heard
wrong
maybe
or
made
more
of
the
words
than
she
should
have
done
she
grew
to
feel
that
he
could
not
have
meant
her
at
all
and
then
turning
suddenly
she
would
find
his
eyes
upon
her
with
a
light
in
them
so
tender
so
yearning
that
she
would
droop
her
own
in
confusion
and
feel
her
heart
beating
wildly
with
the
pleasure
and
the
pain
of
it
about
noon
they
came
to
a
hole
near
which
were
three
indian
hogans
brownleigh
explained
that
he
had
come
this
way
a
little
out
of
the
shortest
trail
hoping
to
get
another
horse
so
that
they
might
travel
faster
and
reach
the
railroad
before
sundown
the
girl
heart
went
suddenly
heavy
as
he
left
her
sitting
on
billy
under
a
cottonwood
tree
while
he
went
forward
to
find
out
if
any
one
was
at
home
and
whether
they
had
a
horse
to
spare
of
course
she
wanted
to
find
her
friends
and
relieve
their
anxiety
as
soon
as
possible
but
there
was
something
in
the
voice
of
the
young
missionary
as
he
spoke
of
hastening
onward
that
seemed
to
build
a
wall
between
them
the
pleasant
intercourse
of
the
morning
seemed
drawing
so
quickly
to
a
close
the
wonderful
sympathy
and
interest
between
them
pushed
with
a
violent
hand
out
of
her
reach
she
felt
a
choking
sensation
in
her
throat
as
if
she
would
like
to
put
her
head
down
on
billy
rough
and
sob
she
tried
to
reason
with
herself
it
was
but
a
little
over
hours
since
she
first
looked
upon
this
stranger
and
yet
her
heart
was
bound
to
him
in
such
a
way
that
she
was
dreading
their
separation
how
could
it
be
such
things
were
not
real
people
always
laughed
at
sudden
love
affairs
as
if
they
were
impossible
but
her
heart
told
her
that
it
was
not
merely
hours
by
which
they
numbered
their
acquaintance
the
soul
of
this
man
had
been
revealed
to
her
in
that
brief
space
of
time
as
another
might
not
have
been
in
years
she
dreaded
the
ending
of
this
companionship
it
would
be
the
end
of
course
he
had
said
it
and
she
knew
his
words
were
true
his
world
was
not
her
world
more
the
pity
he
would
never
give
up
his
world
and
he
had
said
she
was
unfitted
for
his
it
was
all
too
true
this
world
of
rough
uncouth
strangers
and
wild
emptiness
of
beauty
but
how
she
longed
to
have
this
day
with
him
beside
her
prolonged
indefinitely
the
vision
would
fade
of
course
when
she
got
back
into
the
world
again
and
things
would
assume
their
normal
proportions
very
likely
but
just
now
she
admitted
to
herself
that
she
did
not
want
to
get
back
she
would
be
entirely
content
if
she
might
wander
thus
with
him
in
the
desert
for
the
rest
of
her
natural
life
he
came
back
to
her
presently
accompanied
by
an
indian
boy
carrying
an
iron
pot
and
some
fresh
mutton
hazel
watched
them
as
they
built
a
fire
arranged
the
pot
full
of
water
to
boil
and
placed
the
meat
to
roast
the
missionary
was
making
corn
cake
which
presently
was
baking
in
the
ashes
and
giving
forth
a
savoury
odour
an
indian
squaw
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
one
of
the
hogans
her
baby
strapped
to
her
back
and
watched
her
with
great
round
wondering
eyes
hazel
smiled
at
the
little
papoose
and
it
soon
dimpled
into
an
answering
smile
then
she
discovered
that
the
missionary
was
watching
them
both
his
heart
in
his
eyes
a
strange
wonderful
joy
in
his
face
and
her
quickened
she
was
pleasing
him
it
was
then
as
she
smiled
back
at
the
child
of
the
forest
that
she
discovered
an
interest
of
her
own
in
these
neglected
people
of
his
she
could
not
know
that
the
little
baby
whom
she
had
noticed
would
from
this
time
forth
become
the
special
tender
object
of
care
from
the
missionary
just
because
she
had
noticed
it
they
had
a
merry
meal
though
not
so
intimate
as
the
others
had
been
for
a
group
of
indian
women
and
children
huddled
outside
the
nearest
hogan
watching
their
every
move
with
wide
staring
eyes
and
stolid
but
interested
countenances
and
the
little
boy
hovered
not
far
away
to
bring
anything
they
might
need
it
was
all
pleasant
but
hazel
felt
impatient
of
the
interruption
when
their
time
together
was
now
so
short
she
was
glad
when
mounted
on
billy
again
and
her
companion
on
a
rough
little
indian
pony
with
wicked
eyes
they
rode
away
together
into
the
sunshine
of
the
afternoon
but
now
it
seemed
but
a
breathless
space
before
they
would
come
into
the
presence
of
people
for
the
two
horses
made
rapid
time
and
the
distances
flew
past
them
mile
by
mile
the
girl
feeling
each
moment
more
shy
and
embarrassed
and
conscious
of
the
words
she
had
overheard
in
the
early
morning
it
seemed
to
her
a
burden
she
could
not
carry
away
unknown
upon
her
soul
and
yet
how
could
she
let
him
know
viii
renunciation
they
had
entered
a
strip
of
silvery
sand
about
two
miles
wide
and
rode
almost
in
silence
for
a
singular
shyness
had
settled
upon
them
the
girl
was
conscious
of
his
eyes
upon
her
with
a
kind
of
tender
yearning
as
if
he
would
impress
the
image
on
his
mind
for
the
time
when
she
would
be
with
him
no
more
each
had
a
curious
sense
of
understanding
the
other
thoughts
and
needing
no
words
but
as
they
neared
a
great
rustling
stretch
of
corn
he
looked
at
her
keenly
again
and
spoke
you
are
very
tired
i
sure
it
was
not
a
question
but
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
deny
it
and
a
of
sweet
colour
swept
over
the
cheeks
i
knew
it
he
said
searching
her
raised
eyes
we
must
stop
and
rest
after
we
have
passed
through
this
corn
there
is
a
spot
under
some
trees
where
you
will
be
sheltered
from
the
sun
this
corn
lasts
only
a
mile
or
so
more
and
after
you
have
rested
we
will
have
only
a
short
distance
to
go
he
caught
his
breath
as
though
the
words
hurt
him
our
journey
is
almost
over
they
rode
in
silence
through
the
corn
but
when
it
was
passed
and
they
were
seated
beneath
the
trees
the
girl
lifted
her
eyes
to
him
filled
with
unspeakable
things
i
have
known
how
to
thank
you
she
said
earnestly
the
tears
almost
in
evidence
do
please
he
said
gently
it
has
been
good
to
me
to
be
with
you
how
good
you
never
can
know
he
paused
and
then
looked
keenly
at
her
did
you
rest
well
last
night
your
first
night
under
the
stars
did
you
hear
the
coyotes
or
feel
at
all
afraid
her
colour
fled
and
she
dropped
her
glance
to
billy
neck
while
her
heart
throbbed
painfully
he
saw
how
disturbed
she
was
you
were
afraid
he
charged
gently
why
did
you
call
i
was
close
at
hand
all
the
time
what
frightened
you
oh
it
was
nothing
she
said
evasively
it
was
only
for
a
minute
tell
me
please
his
voice
compelled
her
it
was
just
for
a
minute
she
said
again
speaking
rapidly
and
trying
to
hide
her
embarrassment
i
woke
and
thought
i
heard
talking
and
you
were
not
in
sight
but
it
was
not
long
before
you
came
back
with
an
armful
of
wood
and
i
saw
it
was
almost
morning
her
cheeks
were
rosy
as
she
lifted
her
clear
eyes
to
meet
his
searching
gaze
and
tried
to
face
him
steadily
but
he
looked
into
the
very
depths
of
her
soul
and
saw
the
truth
she
felt
her
courage
going
from
her
and
tried
to
turn
her
gaze
carelessly
away
but
could
not
at
last
he
said
in
a
low
voice
full
of
feeling
you
heard
me
her
eyes
which
he
had
held
with
his
look
wavered
faltered
and
drooped
i
was
afraid
he
said
as
her
silence
confirmed
his
conviction
i
heard
some
one
stirring
i
looked
and
thought
i
saw
you
going
back
to
your
couch
there
was
grave
in
his
tone
but
no
reproach
for
her
nevertheless
her
heart
burned
with
shame
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
hid
her
glowing
face
in
her
hands
and
cried
out
i
am
so
sorry
i
did
not
mean
to
be
listening
i
thought
from
the
tone
of
your
voice
you
were
in
trouble
i
was
afraid
some
one
had
attacked
you
and
perhaps
i
could
do
something
to
help
you
poor
child
he
said
deeply
moved
how
unpardonable
of
me
to
frighten
you
it
is
my
habit
of
talking
aloud
when
i
am
alone
the
great
loneliness
out
here
has
cultivated
it
i
did
not
realize
that
i
might
disturb
you
what
must
you
think
of
me
what
you
think
think
she
burst
forth
softly
i
think
you
are
all
wrong
to
try
to
keep
a
thing
like
that
to
yourself
and
then
the
full
meaning
of
what
she
had
said
broke
upon
her
and
her
face
crimsoned
with
embarrassment
but
he
was
looking
at
her
with
an
eager
light
in
his
eyes
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
wo
you
please
explain
hazel
was
sitting
now
with
her
face
entirely
turned
away
and
the
soft
hair
blowing
concealingly
about
her
burning
cheeks
she
felt
as
if
she
must
get
up
and
run
away
into
the
desert
and
end
this
terrible
conversation
she
was
getting
in
deeper
and
deeper
every
minute
please
said
the
gentle
firm
voice
why
i
think
a
a
woman
has
a
right
to
know
a
thing
like
that
she
faltered
desperately
why
asked
the
voice
again
after
a
pause
because
she
she
might
not
ever
she
might
not
ever
know
there
was
such
a
love
for
a
woman
in
the
world
she
stammered
still
with
her
head
turned
quite
away
from
him
she
felt
that
she
could
never
turn
around
and
face
this
wonderful
man
of
the
desert
again
she
wished
the
ground
would
open
and
show
her
some
comfortable
way
of
escape
the
pause
this
time
was
long
so
long
that
it
frightened
her
but
she
dared
not
turn
and
look
at
him
if
she
had
done
so
she
would
have
seen
that
he
was
sitting
with
bowed
head
for
some
time
in
deep
meditation
and
that
at
last
he
lifted
his
glance
to
the
sky
again
as
if
to
ask
a
swift
permission
then
he
spoke
a
man
has
no
right
to
tell
a
woman
he
loves
her
when
he
can
not
ask
her
to
marry
him
that
said
the
girl
her
throat
throbbing
painfully
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
was
not
talking
about
marrying
but
i
think
she
has
a
right
to
know
it
would
make
a
difference
all
her
life
her
throat
was
dry
and
throbbing
the
words
seemed
to
stick
as
she
tried
to
utter
them
yet
they
would
be
said
she
longed
to
hide
her
burning
face
in
some
cool
shelter
and
get
away
from
this
terrible
talk
but
she
could
only
sit
rigidly
quiet
her
fingers
fastened
tensely
in
the
coarse
grass
at
her
side
there
was
a
longer
silence
now
and
still
she
dared
not
look
at
the
man
a
great
eagle
appeared
in
the
heaven
above
and
sailed
swiftly
and
strongly
towards
a
mountain
peak
hazel
had
a
sense
of
her
own
smallness
and
of
the
fact
that
her
words
had
made
an
exquisite
anguish
for
the
soul
of
her
companion
yet
she
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
that
would
better
matters
at
last
he
spoke
and
his
voice
was
like
one
performing
a
sad
and
sacred
rite
for
one
tenderly
beloved
and
now
that
you
know
i
love
you
can
it
possibly
make
any
difference
to
you
hazel
tried
three
times
to
answer
but
every
time
her
trembling
lips
would
frame
no
words
then
suddenly
her
face
went
into
her
hands
and
the
tears
came
she
felt
as
if
a
benediction
had
been
laid
upon
her
head
and
the
glory
of
it
was
greater
than
she
could
bear
the
man
watched
her
his
arms
longing
to
enfold
her
and
soothe
her
agitation
but
he
would
not
his
heart
was
on
fire
with
the
sweetness
and
the
pain
of
the
present
moment
yet
he
could
not
take
advantage
of
their
situation
upon
the
lonely
plain
and
desecrate
the
beauty
of
the
trust
she
had
put
upon
him
then
her
strength
came
again
and
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
into
his
waiting
eyes
with
a
trembling
shy
glance
yet
true
and
earnest
it
will
make
a
difference
to
me
she
said
i
shall
never
feel
quite
the
same
towards
life
again
because
i
know
there
is
such
a
wonderful
man
in
the
world
she
had
fine
control
of
her
voice
now
and
was
holding
back
the
tears
her
manner
of
the
world
was
coming
to
her
aid
he
must
not
see
how
much
this
was
to
her
how
very
much
she
put
out
a
little
cold
hand
and
laid
it
timidly
in
his
big
brown
one
and
he
held
it
a
moment
and
looked
down
at
it
in
great
tenderness
closed
his
fingers
over
it
in
a
strong
clasp
then
laid
it
gently
back
in
her
lap
as
though
it
were
too
precious
to
keep
her
heart
thrilled
and
thrilled
again
at
his
touch
thank
you
he
said
simply
a
great
withdrawing
in
his
tone
but
i
can
not
see
how
you
can
think
well
of
me
i
am
an
utter
stranger
to
you
i
have
no
right
to
talk
of
such
things
to
you
you
did
not
tell
me
answered
hazel
you
told
god
her
voice
was
slow
and
low
with
awe
i
only
overheard
it
was
my
fault
but
i
am
not
sorry
it
was
a
great
thing
to
hear
he
watched
her
shy
dignity
as
she
talked
her
face
drooping
and
half
turned
away
she
was
exquisitely
beautiful
in
her
confusion
his
whole
spirit
yearned
towards
hers
i
feel
like
a
monster
he
said
suddenly
you
know
i
love
you
but
you
do
not
understand
how
in
this
short
time
even
you
have
filled
my
life
my
whole
being
and
yet
i
may
not
ever
try
or
hope
to
win
your
love
in
return
it
must
seem
strange
to
you
i
think
i
understand
she
said
in
a
low
voice
you
spoke
of
all
that
in
the
night
you
know
it
seemed
as
if
she
shrank
from
hearing
it
again
will
you
let
me
explain
it
thoroughly
to
you
if
you
think
best
she
turned
her
face
away
and
watched
the
eagle
now
a
mere
speck
in
the
distance
you
see
it
is
this
way
i
am
not
free
to
do
as
i
might
wish
as
other
men
are
free
i
have
consecrated
my
life
to
the
service
of
god
in
this
place
i
know
i
knew
when
i
came
here
that
it
was
no
place
to
bring
a
woman
there
are
few
who
could
stand
the
life
it
is
filled
with
privations
and
hardships
they
are
inevitable
you
are
used
to
tender
care
and
luxury
no
man
could
ask
a
sacrifice
like
that
of
a
woman
he
loved
he
would
not
be
a
man
if
he
did
it
is
not
like
marrying
a
girl
who
has
felt
the
call
herself
and
loves
to
give
her
life
to
the
work
that
would
be
a
different
matter
but
a
man
has
no
right
to
expect
it
of
a
woman
he
paused
to
find
the
right
words
and
hazel
in
a
small
still
voice
of
dignity
reminded
him
you
are
forgetting
one
of
the
reasons
forgetting
he
turned
towards
her
wonderingly
and
their
eyes
met
for
just
an
instant
then
hers
were
turned
away
again
yes
she
went
on
inscrutably
you
thought
i
was
not
fit
she
was
pulling
up
bits
of
green
from
the
ground
beside
her
she
felt
a
frightened
flutter
in
her
throat
it
was
the
point
of
the
thorn
that
had
remained
in
her
heart
it
was
not
in
nature
for
her
not
to
speak
of
it
yet
when
it
was
spoken
she
felt
how
it
might
be
misunderstood
but
the
missionary
made
answer
in
a
kind
of
cry
like
some
hurt
creature
not
fit
oh
my
dear
you
do
not
understand
there
was
that
in
his
tone
that
extracted
the
last
bit
of
rankling
thorn
from
hazel
heart
and
brought
the
quick
blood
to
her
cheeks
again
with
a
light
laugh
that
echoed
with
relief
and
a
deep
new
joy
which
she
dared
not
face
as
yet
she
sprang
to
her
feet
oh
yes
i
understand
she
said
gaily
and
it
all
true
i
not
a
bit
fit
for
a
missionary
but
ought
we
to
be
moving
on
i
quite
rested
now
with
a
face
that
was
grave
to
sadness
he
acquiesced
fastening
the
canvas
in
place
on
the
saddle
and
putting
her
on
her
horse
with
swift
silent
movements
then
as
she
gathered
up
the
reins
he
lingered
for
an
instant
and
taking
the
hem
of
her
gown
in
his
fingers
he
stooped
and
touched
his
lips
lightly
reverently
to
the
cloth
there
was
something
so
humble
so
pathetic
so
in
the
homage
that
the
tears
sprang
to
the
girl
eyes
and
she
longed
to
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
draw
his
face
close
to
hers
and
tell
him
how
her
heart
was
throbbing
in
sympathy
but
he
had
not
even
asked
for
her
love
and
there
must
be
silence
between
them
he
had
shown
that
it
was
the
only
way
her
own
reserve
closed
her
lips
and
commanded
that
she
show
no
sign
and
now
they
rode
on
silently
for
the
most
part
the
horses
hoofs
beating
rapidly
in
unison
now
and
then
a
rabbit
scuttled
on
ahead
of
them
or
a
horned
toad
hopped
out
of
their
path
short
brown
lizards
palpitated
on
bits
of
wood
along
the
way
now
and
then
a
bright
green
one
showed
itself
and
disappeared
once
they
came
upon
a
village
of
prairie
dogs
and
paused
to
watch
their
antics
for
a
moment
it
was
then
as
they
turned
away
that
she
noticed
the
bit
of
green
he
had
stuck
in
his
buttonhole
and
recognized
it
for
the
same
that
she
had
played
with
as
they
talked
by
the
wayside
her
eyes
charged
him
with
having
picked
it
up
afterwards
and
his
eyes
replied
with
the
truth
but
they
said
no
words
about
it
they
did
not
need
words
it
was
not
until
they
reached
the
top
of
a
sloping
hill
and
suddenly
came
upon
the
view
of
the
valley
with
its
winding
track
gleaming
in
the
late
afternoon
sun
the
little
wooden
station
and
few
cabins
dotted
here
and
there
that
she
suddenly
realized
that
their
journey
together
was
at
an
end
for
this
was
the
place
from
which
she
had
started
two
days
before
he
had
no
need
to
tell
her
she
saw
the
smug
red
gleam
of
their
own
private
car
standing
on
the
track
not
far
away
she
was
brought
face
to
face
with
the
fact
that
her
friends
were
down
there
in
the
valley
and
all
the
stiff
conventionalities
of
her
life
stood
ready
to
build
a
wall
between
this
man
and
herself
they
would
sweep
him
out
of
her
life
as
if
she
had
never
met
him
never
been
found
and
saved
by
him
and
carry
her
away
to
their
tiresome
round
of
parties
and
pleasure
excursions
again
she
lifted
her
eyes
with
a
frightened
almost
pleading
glance
as
if
for
a
moment
she
would
ask
him
to
turn
with
her
back
to
the
desert
again
she
found
his
eyes
upon
her
in
a
long
deep
gaze
of
farewell
as
one
looks
upon
the
face
of
a
beloved
soon
to
be
parted
from
earth
she
could
not
bear
the
blinding
of
the
love
she
saw
there
and
her
own
heart
leaped
up
anew
to
meet
it
in
answering
love
but
it
was
only
this
one
flash
of
a
glance
they
had
when
they
were
aware
of
voices
and
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
and
almost
instantly
around
the
clump
of
below
the
trail
there
swept
into
sight
three
horsemen
shag
bunce
an
indian
and
hazel
brother
they
were
talking
excitedly
and
evidently
starting
out
on
a
new
search
the
missionary
with
quick
presence
of
mind
started
the
horses
on
shouting
out
a
greeting
and
was
answered
with
instant
cheers
from
the
approaching
party
followed
by
shots
from
shag
bunce
in
signal
that
the
lost
was
found
shots
which
immediately
seemed
to
echo
from
the
valley
and
swell
into
shouting
and
rejoicing
then
all
was
confusion
at
once
the
handsome
reckless
brother
with
gold
hair
like
hazel
embraced
her
talking
loud
and
eagerly
showing
how
he
had
done
this
and
that
to
find
her
blaming
the
country
the
horses
the
guides
the
roads
and
paying
little
heed
to
the
missionary
who
instantly
dropped
behind
to
give
him
his
place
it
seemed
but
a
second
more
before
they
were
surrounded
with
eager
people
all
talking
at
once
and
hazel
distressed
that
her
brother
gave
so
little
attention
to
the
man
who
had
saved
her
sought
thrice
to
make
some
sort
of
an
introduction
but
the
brother
was
too
much
taken
up
with
excitement
and
with
scolding
his
sister
for
having
gotten
herself
lost
to
take
it
in
then
out
came
the
father
who
it
appeared
had
been
up
two
nights
on
the
search
and
had
been
taking
a
brief
nap
his
face
was
pale
and
haggard
brownleigh
liked
the
look
of
his
eyes
as
he
caught
sight
of
his
daughter
and
his
face
lighted
as
he
saw
her
spring
into
his
arms
crying
daddy
daddy
i
so
sorry
i
frightened
you
behind
him
tall
and
disapproving
with
an
in
her
eye
stood
aunt
maria
headstrong
girl
she
murmured
severely
you
have
given
us
all
two
terrible
days
and
she
pecked
hazel
cheek
stiffly
but
no
one
heard
her
in
the
excitement
behind
aunt
maria
hazel
maid
wrung
her
hands
and
wept
in
a
kind
of
hysterical
joy
over
her
mistress
return
and
back
of
her
in
the
gloom
of
the
car
vestibule
loomed
the
dark
countenance
of
hamar
with
an
angry
red
mark
across
one
cheek
he
did
not
look
particularly
anxious
to
be
there
the
missionary
turned
from
his
evil
face
with
repulsion
in
the
confusion
and
delight
over
the
return
of
the
lost
one
the
man
of
the
desert
prepared
to
slip
away
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
mount
his
pony
hazel
turned
and
saw
him
daddy
come
over
here
and
speak
to
the
man
who
found
me
and
brought
me
safely
back
again
she
said
dragging
her
father
eagerly
across
the
platform
to
where
the
missionary
stood
the
father
came
readily
enough
and
hazel
talked
rapidly
her
eyes
shining
her
cheeks
like
twin
roses
telling
in
a
breath
of
the
horrors
and
darkness
and
rescue
and
the
thoughtfulness
of
her
radcliffe
came
forward
with
outstretched
hand
to
greet
him
and
the
missionary
took
off
his
hat
and
stood
with
easy
grace
to
shake
hands
he
was
not
conscious
then
of
the
fire
of
eyes
upon
him
cold
society
stares
from
aunt
maria
hamar
and
young
radcliffe
as
if
to
say
how
dared
he
presume
to
expect
recognition
for
doing
what
was
a
simple
duty
he
noted
only
the
genuine
heartiness
in
the
face
of
the
father
as
he
thanked
him
for
what
he
had
done
then
like
the
practical
man
of
the
world
that
he
was
radcliffe
reached
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
drew
out
his
check
book
remarking
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
course
that
he
wished
to
reward
his
daughter
rescuer
handsomely
and
inquiring
his
name
as
he
pulled
off
the
cap
from
his
fountain
pen
brownleigh
stood
back
stiffly
with
a
heightened
colour
and
an
almost
haughty
look
upon
his
face
thank
you
he
said
coldly
i
could
not
think
of
taking
anything
for
a
mere
act
of
humanity
it
was
a
pleasure
to
be
able
to
serve
your
daughter
and
he
swung
himself
easily
into
the
saddle
but
radcliffe
was
unaccustomed
to
such
independence
in
those
who
served
him
and
he
began
to
bluster
hazel
however
her
cheeks
fairly
blazing
her
eyes
filled
with
mortification
put
a
hand
upon
her
father
arm
daddy
you
do
understand
she
said
earnestly
my
new
friend
is
a
clergyman
he
is
a
missionary
daddy
nonsense
daughter
you
do
understand
these
matters
just
wait
until
i
am
through
i
can
not
let
a
deed
like
this
go
unrewarded
a
missionary
did
you
say
then
if
you
wo
take
anything
for
yourself
take
it
for
your
church
it
all
the
same
in
the
end
and
he
gave
a
knowing
wink
towards
the
missionary
whose
anger
was
rising
rapidly
and
who
was
having
much
ado
to
keep
a
meek
and
quiet
spirit
thank
you
he
said
again
coldly
not
for
any
such
service
but
i
mean
it
grumbled
the
elder
man
much
annoyed
i
want
to
donate
something
to
a
cause
that
employs
a
man
like
you
it
is
a
good
to
the
country
at
large
to
have
such
men
patrolling
the
deserts
i
never
thought
there
was
much
excuse
for
home
missions
but
after
this
i
shall
give
it
my
hearty
approval
it
makes
the
country
safer
for
tourists
come
tell
me
your
name
and
i
write
out
a
check
i
in
earnest
send
any
contribution
you
wish
to
make
to
the
general
fund
said
brownleigh
with
dignity
mentioning
the
address
of
the
new
york
board
under
whose
auspices
he
was
sent
out
but
do
mention
me
please
then
he
lifted
his
hat
once
more
and
would
have
ridden
away
but
for
the
distress
in
hazel
eyes
just
then
the
brother
created
a
digression
by
rushing
up
to
his
father
dad
aunt
maria
wants
to
know
if
we
ca
go
on
with
this
train
in
sight
now
and
she
is
nearly
crazy
to
get
on
the
move
nothing
to
hinder
our
being
hitched
on
is
there
the
agent
has
the
order
do
dad
let
get
out
of
this
i
sick
of
it
and
aunt
maria
is
unbearable
yes

arthur

to
the
agent
we
go
on
at
once
excuse
me
ah
what
did
you
say

sorry

that
way
about
it
though
it
very
commendable
very
commendable

york

once
fifth
avenue
did
you
say
i
speak

good
word
for

the
agent

beckoning
me
well
and
thank
you
again
daughter
you
better
get
right
into
the
car
the
train
is
almost
here
and
they
may
have
no
time
to
spare
and
radcliffe
hastened
up
the
platform
after
his
son
and
the
agent
ix
for
remembrance
hazel
turned
her
troubled
eyes
to
the
face
of
the
man
pleadingly
my
father
does
not
understand
she
said
apologetically
he
is
very
grateful
and
he
is
used
to
thinking
that
money
can
always
show
gratitude
brownleigh
was
off
his
horse
beside
her
his
hat
off
before
she
had
finished
speaking
do
i
beg
of
you
think
of
it
again
he
pleaded
his
eyes
devouring
her
face
it
is
all
right
i
quite
understand
and
you
understand
too
i
am
sure
yes
i
understand
she
said
lifting
her
eyes
full
of
the
love
she
had
not
dared
to
let
him
see
she
was
fidgetting
with
her
rings
as
she
spoke
and
looked
back
anxiously
at
the
onrushing
train
her
brother
hurrying
down
the
platform
to
their
car
called
to
her
to
hasten
as
he
passed
her
and
she
knew
she
would
be
allowed
but
a
moment
more
she
caught
her
breath
and
looked
at
the
tall
missionary
wistfully
you
will
let
me
leave
something
of
my
own
with
you
just
for
remembrance
she
asked
eagerly
his
eyes
grew
tender
and
misty
of
course
he
said
his
voice
suddenly
husky
though
i
shall
need
nothing
to
remember
you
by
i
can
never
forget
you
the
memory
of
that
look
of
his
eyes
was
meat
and
drink
to
her
soul
during
many
days
that
followed
but
she
met
it
now
steadily
not
even
flushing
at
her
open
recognition
of
his
love
this
is
mine
she
said
my
father
bought
it
for
me
when
i
was
sixteen
i
have
worn
it
ever
since
he
will
never
care
she
slipped
a
ring
from
her
finger
and
dropped
it
in
his
palm
hurry
up
there
sister
called
young
radcliffe
once
more
from
the
car
window
and
looking
up
brownleigh
saw
the
evil
face
of
hamar
peering
from
another
window
hazel
turned
struggling
to
keep
back
the
rising
tears
i
must
go
she
gasped
brownleigh
flung
the
reins
of
the
pony
to
a
young
indian
who
stood
near
and
turning
walked
beside
her
conscious
the
while
of
the
frowning
faces
watching
them
from
the
car
windows
and
i
have
nothing
to
give
you
he
said
to
her
in
a
low
tone
deeply
moved
at
what
she
had
done
will
you
let
me
have
the
little
book
she
asked
shyly
his
eyes
lit
with
a
kind
of
glory
as
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
his
bible
it
is
the
best
thing
i
own
he
said
may
it
bring
you
the
same
joy
and
comfort
it
has
often
brought
to
me
and
he
put
the
little
book
in
her
hand
the
train
backed
crashing
up
and
jarred
into
the
private
car
with
a
snarling
grating
sound
brownleigh
put
hazel
on
the
steps
and
helped
her
up
her
father
was
hurrying
towards
them
and
some
train
hands
were
making
a
great
fuss
shouting
directions
there
was
just
an
instant
for
a
and
then
he
stepped
back
to
the
platform
and
her
father
swung
himself
on
as
the
train
moved
off
she
stood
on
the
top
step
of
the
car
her
eyes
upon
his
face
and
his
upon
hers
his
hat
lifted
in
homage
and
renunciation
upon
his
brow
as
though
it
were
a
crown
it
was
the
voice
of
her
aunt
maria
that
recalled
her
to
herself
while
the
little
station
with
its
primitive
setting
its
straggling
onlookers
and
its
one
great
man
slipped
past
and
was
blurred
into
the
landscape
by
the
tears
which
she
could
not
keep
back
hazel
for
pity
sake
do
stand
mooning
and
gazing
at
that
rude
creature
any
longer
we
have
you
falling
off
the
train
and
being
dramatically
rescued
again
for
the
delectation
of
the
natives
i
sure
you
made
disturbance
enough
for
one
trip
and
you
better
come
in
and
try
to
make
amends
to
poor
hamar
for
what
you
have
made
him
suffer
with
your
foolish
persistence
in
going
off
on
a
wild
western
pony
that
ran
away
you
have
spoken
to
hamar
yet
perhaps
you
know
that
he
risked
his
life
for
you
trying
to
catch
your
horse
and
was
thrown
and
kicked
in
the
face
by
his
own
wretched
little
beast
and
left
lying
unconscious
for
hours
on
the
desert
until
an
indian
came
along
and
picked
him
up
and
helped
him
back
to
the
station
as
a
matter
of
fact
milton
hamar
had
planned
and
enacted
this
touching
drama
with
the
help
of
a
passing
indian
when
he
found
that
hazel
was
gone
leaving
an
ugly
whip
mark
on
his
cheek
which
must
be
explained
to
the
family
he
may
bear
that
dreadful
scar
for
life
he
will
think
you
an
ungrateful
girl
if
you
do
go
at
once
and
make
your
apologies
for
answer
hazel
surreptitiously
brushing
away
the
tears
swept
past
her
aunt
and
locked
herself
into
her
own
little
private
stateroom
she
rushed
eagerly
to
the
window
which
was
partly
open
guarded
with
a
screen
and
pressed
her
face
against
the
upper
part
of
the
glass
the
train
had
described
a
curve
across
the
prairie
and
the
station
was
still
visible
though
far
away
she
was
sure
she
could
see
the
tall
figure
of
her
lover
standing
with
hat
in
hand
watching
her
as
she
passed
from
his
sight
with
quick
impulse
she
caught
up
a
long
white
crepe
scarf
that
lay
on
her
berth
and
snatching
the
screen
from
the
window
fluttered
the
scarf
out
to
the
wind
almost
instantly
a
flutter
of
white
came
from
the
figure
on
the
platform
and
her
heart
quickened
with
joy
they
had
sent
a
message
from
heart
to
heart
across
the
wide
space
of
the
plains
and
the
wireless
telegraphy
of
hearts
was
established
great
tears
rushed
to
blot
the
last
flutter
of
white
from
the
receding
landscape
and
then
a
hill
loomed
brilliant
and
shifting
and
in
a
moment
more
shut
out
the
sight
of
station
and
dim
group
and
hazel
knew
that
she
was
back
in
the
world
of
commonplace
things
once
more
with
only
a
memory
for
her
company
amid
a
background
of
unsympathetic
relatives
she
made
her
toilet
in
a
leisurely
way
for
she
dreaded
to
have
to
talk
as
she
knew
she
would
and
dreaded
still
more
to
meet
hamar
but
she
knew
she
must
go
and
tell
her
father
of
her
experiences
and
presently
she
came
out
to
them
fresh
and
beautiful
with
eyes
but
the
brighter
for
her
tears
and
a
soft
flush
on
her
cheeks
that
made
her
beauty
all
the
sweeter
they
clamoured
at
once
of
course
for
all
the
details
of
her
experience
and
began
by
rehearsing
once
more
how
hard
hamar
had
tried
to
save
her
from
her
terrible
plight
risking
his
life
to
stop
her
horse
hazel
said
nothing
to
this
but
one
steady
clear
look
at
the
disfigured
face
of
the
man
who
had
made
them
believe
all
this
was
the
only
recognition
she
gave
of
his
heroism
in
that
look
she
managed
to
show
her
utter
disbelief
and
contempt
though
her
aunt
maria
and
perhaps
even
her
father
and
brother
thought
her
gratitude
too
deep
for
utterance
before
them
all
the
girl
passed
over
the
matter
of
the
runaway
with
a
brief
word
saying
that
the
pony
had
made
up
his
mind
to
run
and
she
had
lost
the
bridle
which
of
course
explained
her
inability
to
control
him
she
made
light
of
her
ride
however
before
her
aunt
and
told
the
whole
story
most
briefly
until
she
came
to
the
canyon
and
the
howl
of
the
coyotes
she
was
most
warm
in
praise
of
her
rescuer
though
here
too
she
used
few
words
and
avoided
any
description
of
the
ride
back
merely
saying
that
the
missionary
had
shown
himself
a
gentleman
in
every
particular
and
had
given
her
every
care
and
attention
that
her
own
family
could
have
done
under
the
circumstances
making
the
way
pleasant
with
stories
of
the
country
and
the
people
she
said
that
he
was
a
man
of
unusual
culture
and
refinement
she
thought
and
yet
most
earnestly
devoted
to
his
work
and
then
she
abruptly
changed
the
subject
by
asking
about
certain
plans
for
their
further
trip
and
seeming
to
have
no
further
interest
in
what
had
befallen
her
but
all
the
while
she
was
conscious
of
the
piercing
glance
and
frowning
visage
of
milton
hamar
watching
her
and
she
knew
that
as
soon
as
opportunity
offered
itself
he
would
continue
the
hateful
interview
begun
on
the
plain
she
decided
mentally
that
she
would
avoid
any
such
interview
if
possible
and
to
that
end
excused
herself
immediately
after
lunch
had
been
served
saying
she
needed
a
good
sleep
to
make
up
for
the
long
ride
she
had
taken
but
it
was
not
to
sleep
that
she
gave
herself
when
she
was
at
last
able
to
take
refuge
in
her
little
apartment
again
she
looked
out
at
the
passing
landscape
beautiful
with
varied
scenery
all
blurred
with
tears
as
she
thought
of
how
she
had
but
a
little
while
before
been
out
in
its
wide
free
distance
with
one
who
loved
her
how
that
thought
thrilled
and
thrilled
her
and
brought
her
a
fresh
joy
each
time
it
repeated
itself
she
wondered
over
the
miracle
of
it
she
never
had
dreamed
that
love
was
like
this
she
scarce
believed
it
now
she
was
excited
stirred
to
the
depths
by
her
unusual
experience
put
beyond
the
normal
by
the
strangeness
of
the
surroundings
that
had
brought
this
man
into
her
acquaintance
so
said
common
sense
and
warned
her
that
or
the
next
day
or
at
most
next
week
the
thrill
would
all
be
gone
and
she
would
think
of
the
stranger
missionary
as
one
curious
detail
of
her
western
trip
but
her
heart
resented
this
and
down
deep
down
something
else
told
her
this
strange
new
joy
would
not
vanish
that
it
would
live
throughout
her
life
and
that
whatever
in
the
years
came
to
her
she
would
always
know
underneath
all
that
this
had
been
the
real
thing
the
highest
fullness
of
a
perfect
love
for
her
as
the
miles
lengthened
and
her
thoughts
grew
sad
with
the
distance
she
drew
from
its
hiding
place
the
little
book
he
had
given
her
at
parting
she
had
slipped
it
into
the
breast
pocket
of
her
riding
habit
as
she
received
it
for
she
shrank
from
having
her
aunt
keen
eyes
detect
it
and
question
her
she
had
been
too
much
engrossed
with
the
thought
of
separation
to
remember
it
till
now
she
touched
it
tenderly
shyly
as
though
it
were
a
part
of
himself
the
limp
worn
covers
the
look
of
constant
use
all
made
it
inexpressibly
dear
she
had
not
known
before
that
an
inanimate
object
not
beautiful
in
itself
could
bring
such
tender
love
opening
to
the
flyleaf
there
in
clear
bold
writing
was
his
name
john
chadwick
brownleigh
and
for
the
first
time
she
realized
that
there
had
passed
between
them
no
word
of
her
name
strange
that
they
two
should
have
come
so
close
as
to
need
no
names
one
with
the
other
but
her
heart
leaped
up
with
joy
that
she
knew
his
name
and
her
eyes
dwelt
yearningly
upon
the
written
characters
john
how
well
the
name
fitted
him
it
seemed
that
she
would
have
known
it
was
his
even
if
she
had
not
seen
it
written
first
in
one
of
his
possessions
then
she
fell
to
meditating
whether
he
would
have
any
way
of
discovering
her
name
perhaps
her
father
had
given
it
to
him
or
the
station
agent
might
have
known
to
whom
their
car
belonged
of
course
he
would
when
he
received
the
orders
or
did
they
give
orders
about
cars
only
by
numbers
she
wished
she
dared
ask
some
one
perhaps
she
could
find
out
in
some
way
how
those
orders
were
written
and
yet
all
the
time
she
had
an
instinctive
feeling
that
had
he
known
her
name
a
thousand
times
he
would
not
have
communicated
with
her
she
knew
by
that
exalted
look
of
renunciation
upon
his
face
that
no
longing
whatsoever
could
make
him
overstep
the
bounds
which
he
had
laid
down
between
her
soul
and
his
with
a
sigh
she
opened
the
little
book
and
it
fell
apart
of
itself
to
the
place
where
he
had
read
the
night
before
the
page
still
marked
by
the
little
silk
cord
he
had
placed
so
carefully
she
could
see
him
now
with
the
firelight
flickering
on
his
face
and
the
moonlight
silvering
his
head
that
strong
tender
look
upon
his
face
how
wonderful
he
had
been
she
read
the
psalm
over
now
herself
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
ever
consciously
given
herself
to
reading
the
bible
but
there
was
a
charm
about
the
words
that
gave
them
new
meaning
the
charm
of
his
voice
as
she
heard
them
in
memory
and
watched
again
his
face
change
and
stir
at
the
words
as
he
read
the
day
waned
and
the
train
flew
on
but
the
landscape
had
lost
its
attraction
now
for
the
girl
she
pleaded
weariness
and
remained
apart
from
the
rest
dreaming
over
her
wonderful
experience
and
thinking
new
deep
thoughts
of
wonder
regret
sadness
joy
and
when
night
fell
and
the
great
moon
rose
lighting
the
world
again
she
knelt
beside
her
car
window
looking
long
into
the
wide
clear
sky
the
sky
that
covered
him
and
herself
the
moon
that
looked
down
upon
them
both
then
switching
on
the
electric
light
over
her
berth
she
read
the
psalm
once
more
and
fell
asleep
with
her
cheek
upon
the
little
book
and
in
her
heart
a
prayer
for
him
john
brownleigh
standing
upon
the
station
platform
watching
the
train
disappear
behind
the
experienced
for
the
first
time
since
his
coming
to
arizona
a
feeling
of
the
utmost
desolation
lonely
he
had
been
and
homesick
sometimes
but
always
with
a
sense
that
he
was
master
of
it
all
and
that
with
the
delight
of
his
work
it
would
pass
and
leave
him
free
and
glad
in
the
power
wherewith
his
god
had
called
him
to
the
service
but
now
he
felt
that
with
this
train
the
light
of
life
was
going
from
him
and
all
the
glory
of
arizona
and
the
world
in
which
he
had
loved
to
be
was
darkened
on
her
account
for
a
moment
or
two
his
soul
cried
out
that
it
could
not
be
that
he
must
mount
some
winged
steed
and
speed
after
her
whom
his
heart
had
enthroned
then
the
wall
of
the
inevitable
appeared
before
his
eager
eyes
and
reason
crowded
close
to
bring
him
to
his
senses
he
turned
away
to
hide
the
emotion
in
his
face
the
stolid
indian
boy
who
had
been
holding
both
horses
received
his
customary
smile
and
pleasant
word
but
the
missionary
gave
them
more
by
habit
than
thought
this
time
his
soul
had
entered
its
gethsemane
and
his
spirit
was
bowed
within
him
as
soon
as
he
could
get
away
from
the
people
about
the
station
who
had
their
little
griefs
and
joys
and
perplexities
to
tell
him
he
mounted
billy
and
leading
the
borrowed
pony
rode
away
into
the
desert
retracing
the
way
they
had
come
together
but
a
short
time
before
billy
was
tired
and
walked
slowly
drooping
his
head
and
his
master
was
sad
at
heart
so
there
was
no
cheerful
converse
between
them
as
they
travelled
along
it
was
not
far
they
went
only
back
to
the
edge
of
the
corn
where
they
had
made
their
last
stop
of
the
journey
together
a
few
short
hours
before
and
here
the
missionary
halted
and
gave
the
beasts
their
freedom
for
a
respite
and
refreshment
he
himself
felt
too
weary
of
soul
to
go
further
he
took
out
the
ring
the
little
ring
that
was
too
small
to
go
more
than
on
his
smallest
finger
the
ring
she
had
taken
warm
and
flashing
from
her
white
hand
and
laid
within
his
palm
the
sun
low
down
in
the
west
stole
into
the
heart
of
the
jewel
and
sent
its
glory
in
a
million
multicoloured
facets
piercing
his
soul
with
the
pain
and
the
joy
of
his
love
he
cast
himself
down
upon
the
grass
where
she
had
sat
where
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
lips
upon
the
jewel
she
had
worn
he
met
his
enemy
and
fought
his
battle
out
wearied
at
last
with
the
contest
he
slept
the
sun
went
down
the
moon
made
itself
manifest
once
more
and
when
the
night
went
coursing
down
its
way
of
silver
two
jewels
softly
gleamed
in
its
radiance
the
one
upon
his
finger
where
he
had
pressed
her
ring
the
other
from
the
grass
beside
him
with
a
curious
wonder
he
put
forth
his
hand
to
the
second
and
found
it
was
the
topaz
set
in
the
handle
of
her
whip
which
she
had
dropped
and
forgotten
when
they
sat
together
and
talked
by
the
way
he
seized
it
eagerly
now
and
gathered
it
to
him
it
seemed
almost
a
message
of
comfort
from
her
he
loved
it
was
something
tangible
this
and
the
ring
to
show
him
he
had
not
dreamed
her
coming
she
had
been
real
and
she
had
wanted
him
to
tell
her
of
his
love
had
said
it
would
make
a
difference
all
the
rest
of
her
life
he
remembered
that
somewhere
he
had
read
or
heard
a
great
man
say
that
to
be
worthy
of
a
great
love
one
must
be
able
to
do
without
it
here
now
then
he
would
prove
his
love
by
doing
without
he
stood
with
uplifted
face
transfigured
in
the
light
of
the
brilliant
night
with
the
look
of
exalted
but
only
his
heart
communed
that
night
for
there
were
no
words
on
his
dumb
lips
to
express
the
fullness
of
his
abnegation
then
forth
upon
his
way
he
went
his
battle
fought
the
stronger
for
it
to
be
a
staff
for
other
men
to
lean
upon
x
his
mother
deserts
and
mountains
remain
duties
crowd
and
press
hearts
ache
but
the
world
rushes
on
the
weeks
that
followed
showed
these
two
that
a
great
love
is
eternal
brownleigh
did
not
try
to
put
the
thought
of
it
out
of
his
life
but
rather
let
it
glorify
the
common
round
day
after
day
passed
and
he
went
from
post
to
post
from
hogan
to
mesa
and
back
to
his
shanty
again
always
with
the
thought
of
her
companionship
and
found
it
sweet
never
had
he
been
less
cheery
when
he
met
his
friends
though
there
was
a
quiet
dignity
a
tender
reserve
behind
it
all
that
a
few
discerning
ones
perceived
they
said
at
the
fort
that
he
was
losing
flesh
but
if
so
he
was
gaining
muscle
his
lean
brown
arms
were
never
stronger
and
his
fine
strong
face
was
never
sad
when
any
one
was
by
it
was
only
in
the
alone
upon
the
moonlit
desert
or
in
his
little
quiet
dwelling
place
when
he
talked
with
his
father
and
told
all
the
loneliness
and
heartache
his
people
found
him
more
sympathetic
more
painstaking
more
tireless
than
ever
before
and
the
work
prospered
under
his
hand
the
girl
in
the
city
deliberately
set
herself
to
forget
the
first
few
days
after
she
left
him
had
been
a
season
of
ecstatic
joy
mingled
with
deep
depression
as
she
alternately
meditated
upon
the
fact
of
a
great
love
or
faced
its
impossibility
she
had
scorched
milton
hamar
with
her
glance
of
aversion
and
avoided
him
constantly
even
in
the
face
of
protest
from
her
family
until
he
had
made
excuse
and
left
the
party
at
pasadena
there
too
aunt
maria
had
relieved
them
of
her
annoying
interference
and
the
return
trip
taken
by
the
southern
route
had
been
an
unmolested
time
for
meditation
for
the
girl
she
became
daily
more
and
more
dissatisfied
with
herself
and
her
useless
ornamental
life
some
days
she
read
the
little
book
and
other
days
she
shut
it
away
and
tried
to
get
back
to
her
former
life
telling
herself
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
change
herself
she
had
found
that
the
little
book
gave
her
a
deep
unrest
and
a
sense
that
life
held
graver
sweeter
things
than
just
living
to
please
one
self
she
began
to
long
for
home
and
the
summer
round
of
gaieties
with
which
to
fill
the
emptiness
of
her
heart
as
the
summer
advanced
there
was
almost
a
recklessness
sometimes
about
the
way
she
planned
to
have
a
good
time
every
minute
yet
in
the
quiet
of
her
own
room
there
would
always
come
back
the
yearning
that
had
been
awakened
in
the
desert
and
would
not
be
silenced
sometimes
when
the
memory
of
that
great
deep
love
she
had
heard
expressed
for
herself
came
over
her
the
bitter
tears
would
come
to
her
eyes
and
one
thought
would
throb
through
her
consciousness
not
worthy
not
worthy
he
had
not
thought
her
fit
to
be
his
wife
her
father
and
her
world
would
think
it
quite
otherwise
they
would
count
him
unworthy
to
mate
with
her
an
heiress
the
pet
of
society
he
a
man
who
had
given
up
his
life
for
a
whim
a
fad
a
fanatical
fancy
but
she
knew
it
was
not
so
she
knew
him
to
be
a
man
of
all
men
she
knew
it
was
true
that
she
was
not
such
a
woman
as
a
man
like
that
could
fitly
wed
and
the
thought
galled
her
constantly
she
tried
to
accustom
herself
to
think
of
him
as
a
pleasant
experience
a
friend
who
might
have
been
if
circumstances
with
them
both
had
been
different
she
tried
to
tell
herself
that
it
was
a
passing
fancy
with
them
which
both
would
forget
and
she
tried
with
all
her
heart
to
forget
even
locking
away
the
precious
little
book
and
trying
to
forget
it
too
and
then
one
day
in
late
summer
she
went
with
a
motoring
party
through
new
england
as
frolicsome
and
giddy
a
party
as
could
be
found
among
new
york
society
transferred
for
the
summer
to
the
world
of
nature
there
was
to
be
a
dance
or
a
house
party
or
something
of
the
sort
at
the
end
of
the
drive
hazel
scarcely
knew
and
cared
less
she
was
becoming
utterly
weary
of
her
butterfly
life
the
day
was
hot
and
dusty
indian
summer
intensified
they
had
got
out
of
their
way
through
a
mistake
of
the
chauffeur
and
suddenly
just
on
the
edge
of
a
tiny
quaint
little
village
the
car
broke
down
and
refused
to
go
on
without
a
lengthy
siege
of
coaxing
and
petting
the
members
of
the
party
powdered
with
dust
and
in
no
very
pleasant
frame
of
mind
from
the
delay
took
refuge
at
the
village
inn
an
hostelry
close
to
the
roadside
with
wide
piazza
across
the
front
and
a
mysterious
hedged
garden
at
the
side
there
were
many
plain
wooden
rockers
neatly
adorned
with
white
crash
on
the
piazza
and
one
or
two
late
summer
boarders
loitering
about
with
knitting
work
or
book
the
landlord
brought
cool
tinkling
glasses
of
water
and
rich
milk
from
the
and
they
dropped
into
the
chairs
to
wait
while
the
men
of
the
party
gave
assistance
to
the
chauffeur
in
patching
up
the
car
hazel
sank
wearily
into
her
chair
and
sipped
the
milk
unhungrily
she
wished
she
had
not
come
wished
the
day
were
over
and
that
she
might
have
planned
something
more
interesting
wished
she
had
chosen
different
people
to
be
of
her
party
and
idly
watched
a
white
hen
with
yellow
kid
boots
and
a
coral
comb
in
her
nicely
groomed
hair
picking
daintily
about
the
green
under
the
oak
trees
that
shaded
the
street
she
listened
to
the
drone
of
the
bees
in
the
garden
near
by
the
distant
whetting
of
a
scythe
the
monotonous
whang
of
a
steam
thresher
not
far
away
the
happy
voices
of
children
and
thought
how
empty
a
life
in
this
village
would
be
almost
as
dreary
and
uninteresting
as
living
in
a
desert
and
then
suddenly
she
caught
a
name
and
the
pink
flew
into
her
cheeks
and
memory
set
her
heart
athrob
it
was
the
landlord
talking
to
a
lingering
summer
boarder
a
quiet
woman
who
sat
reading
at
the
end
of
the
piazza
well
miss
norton
so
you
goin
to
leave
us
next
week
sorry
to
hear
it
do
seem
you
clear
through
october
you
comin
back
to
granville
in
the
spring
granville
granville
where
had
she
heard
of
granville
ah
she
knew
instantly
it
was
his
old
home
his
mother
lived
there
but
then
of
course
it
might
have
been
another
granville
she
was
even
sure
what
state
they
were
in
now
new
hampshire
or
vermont
they
had
been
wavering
about
on
the
state
line
several
times
that
day
and
she
never
paid
attention
to
geography
then
the
landlord
raised
his
voice
again
he
was
gazing
across
the
road
where
a
white
colonial
house
with
pickets
like
clean
sugar
frosting
nestled
in
the
luscious
grass
green
and
clean
and
fresh
and
seeming
utterly
apart
from
the
soil
and
dust
of
the
road
as
if
nothing
wearisome
could
ever
enter
there
brightly
there
bloomed
a
border
of
late
flowers
double
asters
zinnias
peonies
with
a
flame
of
scarlet
poppies
breaking
into
the
blue
of
larkspurs
and
bachelor
buttons
as
it
neared
the
house
hazel
had
not
noticed
it
until
now
and
she
almost
cried
out
with
pleasure
over
the
splendour
of
colour
wal
said
the
landlord
chinking
some
loose
coins
in
his
capacious
pockets
i
reckon
mis
brownleigh
miss
yeh
as
much
as
enny
of
us
she
lots
on
your
comin
over
to
read
to
her
i
heerd
her
say
as
how
amelia
ellen
is
a
good
nurse
but
she
never
was
much
on
the
readin
an
amelia
ellen
knows
it
too
mis
brownleigh
she
be
powerful
lonesome
fer
yeh
when
yeh
go
it
not
so
lively
fur
her
tied
to
her
bed
er
her
chair
even
ef
john
does
write
to
her
twicet
a
week
and
now
hazel
noticed
that
on
the
covered
veranda
in
front
of
the
wing
of
the
house
across
the
way
there
sat
an
old
lady
on
a
reclining
wheeled
chair
and
that
another
woman
in
a
plain
blue
gown
hovered
near
waiting
upon
her
a
luxuriant
woodbine
partly
hid
the
chair
and
the
distance
was
too
great
to
see
the
face
of
the
woman
but
hazel
grew
weak
with
wonder
and
pleasure
she
sat
quite
still
trying
to
gather
her
forces
while
the
summer
boarder
expressed
earnest
regret
at
having
to
leave
her
chosen
summer
abiding
place
so
much
earlier
than
usual
at
last
her
friends
began
to
rally
hazel
on
her
silence
she
turned
away
annoyed
and
answered
them
crossly
following
the
landlord
into
the
house
and
questioning
him
eagerly
she
had
suddenly
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
she
must
see
brownleigh
and
know
if
she
looked
like
her
son
and
if
she
was
the
kind
of
mother
one
would
expect
such
a
son
to
have
she
felt
that
in
the
sight
might
lie
her
emancipation
from
the
bewitchment
that
had
bound
her
in
its
toils
since
her
western
trip
she
also
secretly
hoped
it
might
justify
her
dearest
dreams
of
what
his
mother
was
like
do
you
suppose
that
lady
across
the
street
would
mind
if
i
went
over
to
look
at
her
beautiful
flowers
she
burst
in
upon
the
astonished
landlord
as
he
tipped
his
chair
back
with
his
feet
on
another
and
prepared
to
browse
over
yesterday
paper
for
the
third
time
that
day
he
brought
his
chair
down
on
its
four
legs
with
a
thump
and
drew
his
hat
further
over
his
forehead
not
a
bit
not
a
bit
young
lady
she
proud
to
show
off
her
flowers
they
one
of
the
sights
of
granville
mis
brownleigh
loves
to
have
jest
go
right
over
an
tell
her
i
sent
you
she
tell
you
all
about
an
like
ez
not
she
give
you
a
bokay
to
take
she
real
generous
with
he
tottered
out
to
the
door
after
her
on
his
stiff
rheumatic
legs
and
suggested
that
the
other
young
ladies
might
like
to
go
along
but
they
one
and
all
declined
to
hazel
intense
relief
and
called
their
ridicule
after
her
as
she
picked
her
way
across
the
dusty
road
and
opened
the
white
gate
into
the
peaceful
scene
beyond
when
she
drew
close
to
the
side
piazza
she
saw
one
of
the
most
beautiful
faces
she
had
ever
looked
upon
the
features
were
delicate
and
exquisitely
modelled
aged
by
years
and
much
suffering
yet
lovely
with
a
peace
that
had
permitted
no
fretting
an
abundance
of
waving
silken
hair
white
as
driven
snow
was
piled
high
upon
her
head
against
the
snowy
pillow
and
soft
brown
eyes
made
the
girl
heart
throb
quickly
with
their
likeness
to
those
other
eyes
that
had
once
looked
into
hers
she
was
dressed
in
a
simple
little
muslin
gown
of
white
and
gray
with
white
finish
at
throat
and
wrists
and
across
the
helpless
limbs
was
flung
a
light
afghan
of
pink
and
gray
wool
she
made
a
sweet
picture
as
she
lay
and
watched
her
approaching
guest
with
a
smile
of
interest
and
welcome
the
landlord
said
you
would
not
mind
if
i
came
over
to
see
your
flowers
hazel
said
with
a
shy
catch
in
her
voice
now
that
she
was
here
she
was
almost
sorry
she
had
come
it
might
not
be
his
mother
at
all
and
what
could
she
say
anyway
yet
her
first
glimpse
told
her
that
this
was
a
mother
to
be
proud
of
the
most
beautiful
mother
in
the
world
he
had
called
her
and
surely
this
woman
could
be
none
other
than
the
one
who
had
mothered
such
a
son
her
highest
ideals
of
motherhood
seemed
realized
as
she
gazed
upon
the
peaceful
face
of
the
invalid
and
then
the
voice
for
the
woman
was
speaking
now
holding
out
a
hand
to
her
and
bidding
her
be
seated
in
the
chinese
willow
chair
that
stood
close
by
the
wheeled
one
a
great
green
silk
cushion
at
the
back
and
a
large
palm
leaf
fan
on
the
table
beside
it
i
am
so
pleased
that
you
came
over
brownleigh
was
saying
i
have
been
wondering
if
some
one
would
come
to
me
i
keep
my
flowers
partly
to
attract
my
friends
for
i
can
stand
a
great
deal
of
company
since
i
all
alone
you
came
in
the
big
motor
car
that
broke
down
did
you
i
been
watching
the
pretty
girls
over
there
in
their
gay
ribbons
and
veils
they
look
like
human
flowers
rest
here
and
tell
me
where
you
have
come
from
and
where
you
are
going
while
amelia
ellen
picks
you
some
flowers
to
take
along
afterwards
you
shall
go
among
them
and
see
if
there
are
any
you
like
that
she
has
missed
amelia
ellen
get
your
basket
and
scissors
and
pick
a
great
many
flowers
for
this
young
lady
it
is
getting
late
and
they
have
not
much
longer
to
blossom
there
are
three
white
buds
on
the
pick
them
all
i
think
they
fit
your
face
my
dear
now
take
off
your
hat
and
let
me
see
your
pretty
hair
without
its
covering
i
want
to
get
your
picture
fixed
in
my
heart
so
i
can
look
at
you
after
you
are
gone
and
so
quite
simply
they
fell
into
easy
talk
about
each
other
the
day
the
village
and
the
flowers
you
see
the
little
white
church
down
the
street
my
husband
was
its
pastor
for
twenty
years
i
came
to
this
house
a
bride
and
our
boy
was
born
here
afterwards
when
his
father
was
taken
away
i
stayed
right
here
with
the
people
who
loved
him
the
boy
was
in
college
then
getting
ready
to
take
up
his
father
work
i
stayed
here
ever
since
i
love
the
people
and
they
love
me
and
i
could
very
well
be
moved
you
know
my
boy
is
out
in
arizona
a
home
missionary
she
said
it
as
abraham
lincoln
mother
might
have
said
my
boy
is
president
of
the
united
states
her
face
wore
a
kind
of
glory
that
bore
a
startling
resemblance
to
the
man
of
the
desert
hazel
marvelled
greatly
and
understood
what
had
made
the
son
so
great
i
do
see
how
he
could
go
and
leave
you
alone
she
broke
forth
almost
bitterly
i
should
think
his
duty
was
here
with
his
mother
yes
i
know
the
mother
smiled
they
do
say
that
some
of
them
but
it
because
they
do
understand
you
see
we
gave
john
to
god
when
he
was
born
and
it
was
our
hope
from
the
first
that
he
would
choose
to
be
a
minister
and
a
missionary
of
course
john
thought
at
first
after
his
father
went
away
that
he
could
not
leave
me
but
i
made
him
see
that
i
would
be
happier
so
he
wanted
me
to
go
with
him
but
i
knew
i
should
only
be
a
hindrance
to
the
work
and
it
came
to
me
that
my
part
in
the
work
was
to
stay
at
home
and
let
him
go
it
was
all
i
had
left
to
do
after
i
became
an
invalid
and
i
very
comfortable
amelia
ellen
takes
care
of
me
like
a
baby
and
there
are
plenty
of
friends
my
boy
writes
me
beautiful
letters
twice
a
week
and
we
have
such
nice
talks
about
the
work
he
very
like
his
father
and
growing
more
so
every
day
perhaps
she
faltered
and
fumbled
under
the
pink
and
silver
lap
robe
perhaps
you
like
to
read
a
bit
of
one
of
his
letters
i
have
it
here
it
came
yesterday
and
i
only
read
it
twice
i
do
let
myself
read
them
too
often
because
they
have
to
last
three
days
apiece
at
least
perhaps
you
read
it
aloud
to
me
i
like
to
hear
john
words
aloud
sometimes
and
amelia
ellen
has
never
spent
much
time
reading
she
is
peculiar
in
her
pronunciation
do
you
mind
reading
it
to
me
she
held
a
letter
forth
written
in
a
strong
free
hand
the
same
that
had
signed
the
name
john
chadwick
brownleigh
in
the
little
book
heart
throbbed
eagerly
and
her
hand
trembled
as
she
reached
it
shyly
towards
the
letter
what
a
miracle
was
this
that
his
very
letter
was
being
put
into
her
hand
her
whom
he
loved
to
read
was
it
possible
could
there
be
a
mistake
no
surely
not
there
could
not
be
two
john
brownleighs
both
missionaries
to
arizona
dear
little
mother
o
mine
it
began
and
plunged
at
once
into
the
breezy
life
of
the
western
country
he
had
been
to
a
cattle
the
week
before
and
he
described
it
minutely
in
terse
and
vivid
language
with
many
a
flash
of
wit
or
graver
touch
of
wisdom
and
here
and
there
a
boyish
expression
that
showed
him
young
at
heart
and
devoted
to
his
mother
he
told
of
a
visit
he
had
paid
to
the
hopi
indians
their
strange
villages
each
like
a
gigantic
house
with
many
rooms
called
a
pueblo
built
on
the
edges
of
lofty
crags
or
mesas
and
looking
like
huge
castles
five
or
six
hundred
feet
above
the
desert
floor
he
told
of
walpi
a
village
out
on
the
end
of
a
great
promontory
its
only
access
a
narrow
neck
of
land
less
than
a
rod
wide
with
one
little
path
worn
more
than
a
foot
deep
in
the
solid
rock
by
the
feet
of
ten
generations
passing
over
it
where
now
live
about
two
hundred
and
thirty
people
in
one
building
there
were
seven
of
these
villages
built
on
three
mesas
that
reach
out
from
the
northern
desert
like
three
great
fingers
oraibi
the
largest
having
over
a
thousand
people
he
explained
that
spanish
explorers
found
these
hopis
in
long
before
the
pilgrims
landed
at
plymouth
rock
and
called
the
country
tusayan
then
he
went
on
to
describe
a
remarkable
meeting
that
had
been
held
in
which
the
indians
had
manifested
deep
interest
in
spiritual
things
and
had
asked
many
curious
questions
about
life
death
and
the
hereafter
you
see
dear
said
the
mother
her
eyes
shining
eagerly
you
see
how
much
they
need
him
and
i
glad
i
can
give
him
it
makes
me
have
a
part
in
the
work
hazel
turned
back
to
the
letter
and
went
on
reading
to
hide
the
tears
that
were
gathering
in
her
own
eyes
as
she
looked
upon
the
exalted
face
of
the
mother
there
was
a
detailed
account
of
a
conference
of
missionaries
to
attend
which
the
rider
had
ridden
ninety
miles
on
horseback
and
at
the
close
there
was
an
exquisite
description
of
the
spot
where
they
had
camped
the
last
night
of
their
ride
she
knew
it
from
the
first
word
almost
and
her
heart
beat
so
wildly
she
could
hardly
keep
her
voice
steady
to
read
i
stopped
over
night
on
the
way
home
at
a
place
i
dearly
love
there
is
a
great
rock
shelving
and
overhanging
for
shelter
from
any
passing
storm
and
quite
near
a
charming
green
boudoir
of
cedars
on
three
sides
and
rock
on
the
fourth
an
abundant
makes
camping
easy
for
me
and
billy
and
the
stars
overhead
are
good
tapers
here
i
build
my
fire
and
boil
the
kettle
read
my
portion
and
lie
down
to
watch
the
heavens
mother
i
wish
you
knew
how
near
to
god
one
feels
out
in
the
desert
with
the
stars
last
night
about
three
i
woke
to
replenish
my
fire
and
watch
a
while
a
great
comet
the
finest
one
for
many
years
i
would
tell
you
about
it
but
i
already
made
this
letter
too
long
and
it
time
billy
and
i
were
on
our
way
again
i
love
this
spot
beside
the
big
rock
and
often
come
back
to
it
on
my
journeys
perhaps
because
here
i
once
camped
with
a
dear
friend
and
we
had
pleasant
converse
together
around
our
brushwood
fire
it
makes
the
desert
seem
less
lonely
because
i
can
sometimes
fancy
my
friend
still
reclining
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
in
the
light
that
plays
against
the
great
rock
well
little
mother
o
mine
i
must
close
cheer
up
for
it
has
been
intimated
to
me
that
i
may
be
sent
east
to
general
assembly
in
the
spring
and
then
for
three
whole
weeks
with
you
that
will
be
when
the
wild
strawberries
are
out
and
i
shall
carry
you
in
my
arms
and
spread
a
couch
for
you
on
the
strawberry
hill
behind
the
house
and
you
shall
pick
some
again
with
your
own
hands
with
a
sudden
catch
in
her
throat
like
a
sob
the
reading
came
to
an
end
and
hazel
her
eyes
bright
with
tears
handed
the
letter
reverently
back
to
the
mother
whose
face
was
bright
with
smiles
is
he
a
boy
worth
giving
she
asked
as
she
folded
the
letter
and
slipped
it
back
under
the
pink
and
gray
cover
he
is
a
great
gift
said
hazel
in
a
low
voice
she
was
almost
glad
that
amelia
ellen
came
up
with
an
armful
of
flowers
just
then
and
she
might
bury
her
face
in
their
freshness
and
hide
the
tears
that
would
not
be
stayed
and
then
before
she
had
half
admired
their
beauty
there
was
a
loud
from
the
road
followed
by
a
more
impatient
one
and
hazel
was
made
aware
that
she
was
being
waited
for
i
sorry
you
must
go
dear
said
the
gentle
woman
i
have
seen
so
beautiful
a
girl
in
years
and
i
sure
you
have
a
lovely
heart
too
i
wish
you
could
visit
me
again
i
will
come
again
some
time
if
you
will
let
me
said
the
girl
impulsively
and
then
stooped
and
kissed
the
soft
cheek
and
fled
down
the
path
trying
to
get
control
of
her
emotion
before
meeting
her
companions
hazel
was
quiet
all
the
rest
of
the
way
and
was
rallied
much
upon
her
solemnity
she
pleaded
a
headache
and
closed
her
eyes
while
each
carried
her
back
over
the
months
and
brought
her
again
to
the
little
camp
under
the
rock
beneath
the
stars
he
remembered
still
he
cared
this
was
what
her
glad
thoughts
sang
as
the
car
whirled
on
and
her
gay
companions
forgot
her
and
chattered
of
their
frivolities
how
wonderful
that
i
should
find
his
mother
she
said
again
and
again
to
herself
yet
it
was
not
so
wonderful
he
had
told
her
the
name
of
the
town
and
she
might
have
come
here
any
time
of
her
own
accord
but
it
was
strange
and
beautiful
that
the
accident
had
brought
her
straight
to
the
door
of
the
house
where
he
had
been
born
and
brought
up
what
a
beautiful
happy
boyhood
he
must
have
had
with
a
mother
like
that
hazel
found
herself
thinking
wistfully
out
of
the
emptiness
of
her
own
motherless
girlhood
yes
she
would
go
back
and
see
the
sweet
mother
some
day
and
she
fell
to
planning
how
it
could
be
xi
refuge
milton
hamar
had
not
troubled
hazel
all
summer
from
time
to
time
her
father
mentioned
him
as
being
connected
with
business
enterprises
and
it
was
openly
spoken
of
now
that
a
divorce
had
been
granted
him
and
his
former
wife
was
soon
to
marry
again
all
this
however
was
most
distasteful
to
the
girl
to
whom
the
slightest
word
about
the
man
served
to
bring
up
the
hateful
scene
of
the
desert
but
early
in
the
fall
he
appeared
among
them
again
assuming
his
old
friendly
attitude
towards
the
whole
family
dropping
in
to
lunch
or
dinner
whenever
it
suited
his
fancy
he
seemed
to
choose
to
forget
what
had
passed
between
hazel
and
himself
to
act
as
though
it
had
not
been
and
resumed
his
former
playful
attitude
of
extreme
interest
in
the
girl
of
whom
he
had
always
been
fond
hazel
however
found
a
certain
air
of
proprietorship
in
his
gaze
a
expression
of
his
admiration
which
was
offensive
she
could
not
forget
try
as
hard
as
she
might
for
her
father
sake
to
forgive
she
shrank
away
from
the
man
company
avoided
him
whenever
possible
and
at
last
when
he
seemed
to
be
almost
omnipresent
and
growing
every
day
more
insistent
in
his
attentions
she
cast
about
her
for
some
absorbing
interest
which
would
take
her
out
of
his
sphere
then
a
strange
fancy
took
her
in
its
possession
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
it
came
to
her
where
she
had
been
turning
her
luxurious
pillow
for
two
hours
trying
in
vain
to
tempt
a
drowsiness
that
would
not
come
and
she
arose
at
once
and
wrote
a
brief
and
businesslike
letter
to
the
landlord
of
the
little
new
hampshire
inn
where
she
had
been
delayed
for
a
couple
of
hours
in
the
fall
in
the
morning
true
to
her
impulsive
nature
she
besieged
her
father
until
he
gave
his
permission
for
her
to
take
her
maid
and
a
quiet
elderly
cousin
of
his
and
go
away
for
a
complete
rest
before
the
society
season
began
it
was
a
strange
whim
for
his
butterfly
daughter
to
take
but
the
busy
man
saw
no
harm
in
it
and
was
fully
convinced
that
it
was
merely
her
way
of
punishing
some
over
ardent
follower
for
a
few
days
and
feeling
sure
she
would
soon
return
he
let
her
go
she
had
had
her
way
all
her
life
and
why
should
he
cross
her
in
so
simple
a
matter
as
a
few
rest
in
a
country
inn
with
a
respectable
chaperone
the
letter
to
the
landlord
was
outtravelled
by
a
telegram
whose
answer
sent
hazel
on
her
way
the
next
morning
thankful
that
she
had
been
able
to
get
away
during
a
temporary
absence
of
milton
hamar
and
that
her
father
had
promised
not
to
let
any
of
her
friends
know
of
her
whereabouts
his
eye
had
twinkled
as
he
made
the
promise
he
was
quite
sure
which
of
her
many
admirers
was
being
punished
but
he
did
not
tell
her
so
he
intended
to
be
most
judicious
with
all
her
young
men
friends
he
so
confided
his
intentions
to
milton
hamar
that
evening
having
no
thought
that
hazel
would
mind
their
old
friend
knowing
two
days
later
hazel
after
establishing
her
little
party
comfortably
in
the
best
rooms
the
new
hampshire
inn
afforded
putting
a
large
box
of
new
novels
at
their
disposal
and
another
of
sweets
and
sending
orders
for
new
magazines
to
be
forwarded
went
over
to
call
on
the
sweet
old
lady
towards
whom
her
heart
had
been
turning
eagerly
with
a
longing
that
would
not
be
put
away
ever
since
that
first
accidental
or
providential
meeting
when
she
came
back
through
the
first
early
with
her
cheeks
like
winter
roses
and
her
furry
hat
all
feathered
with
great
white
flakes
she
found
milton
hamar
seated
in
front
of
the
open
fire
in
the
office
making
the
air
heavy
with
his
best
tobacco
and
frowning
impatiently
through
the
windows
the
bright
look
faded
instantly
from
her
face
and
the
peace
which
she
had
almost
caught
from
the
woman
across
the
way
her
eyes
flashed
indignantly
and
her
whole
small
frame
stiffened
for
the
combat
that
she
knew
must
come
now
there
was
no
mistaking
her
look
milton
hamar
knew
at
once
that
he
was
not
welcome
she
stood
for
an
instant
with
the
door
wide
open
blowing
a
great
gust
of
biting
air
across
the
wide
room
and
into
his
face
a
cloud
of
smoke
sprang
out
from
the
fireplace
to
meet
it
and
the
two
came
together
in
front
of
the
man
and
made
a
visible
wall
for
a
second
between
him
and
the
girl
he
sprang
to
his
feet
cigar
in
hand
and
an
angry
exclamation
upon
his
lips
the
office
fortunately
was
without
other
occupant
why
in
the
name
of
all
that
unholy
did
you
lead
me
a
race
away
off
to
this
forsaken
little
hole
in
midwinter
hazel
he
cried
hazel
drew
herself
to
her
full
height
and
with
the
dignity
that
well
became
her
answered
him
really
hamar
what
right
have
you
to
speak
to
me
in
that
way
and
what
right
had
you
to
follow
me
the
right
of
the
man
who
is
going
to
marry
you
he
answered
fiercely
and
i
think
it
about
time
this
nonsense
stopped
it
nothing
but
coquettish
foolishness
your
coming
here
i
hate
coquettish
fools
i
did
think
you
had
it
in
you
to
coquet
but
it
seems
all
women
are
alike
hamar
you
are
forgetting
yourself
said
the
girl
quietly
turning
to
shut
the
door
that
she
might
gain
time
to
get
control
of
her
shaken
nerves
she
had
a
swift
vision
of
what
it
would
be
if
she
were
married
to
a
man
like
that
no
wonder
his
wife
was
entirely
willing
to
give
him
a
divorce
but
she
shuddered
as
she
turned
back
and
faced
him
bravely
well
what
did
you
come
here
for
he
asked
in
a
less
fierce
tone
i
came
because
i
wanted
to
be
quiet
hazel
said
trying
to
steady
her
voice
and
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
truth
i
came
because
i
wanted
to
get
away
from
you
i
have
not
liked
the
way
you
acted
towards
me
since
that
day
in
arizona
the
man
fierce
brows
drew
together
but
a
kind
of
mask
of
apology
overspread
his
features
he
perceived
that
he
had
gone
too
far
with
the
girl
whom
he
had
thought
scarcely
more
than
a
child
he
had
thought
he
could
mould
her
like
wax
and
that
his
scorn
would
instantly
wither
her
wiles
he
watched
her
steadily
for
a
full
minute
the
girl
though
trembling
in
every
nerve
sending
back
a
steady
haughty
gaze
do
you
mean
that
he
said
at
last
i
do
her
voice
was
quiet
but
she
was
on
the
verge
of
tears
well
perhaps
we
better
talk
it
over
i
see
i
taken
too
much
for
granted
i
thought
you
understood
for
a
year
or
more
what
was
going
on
what
i
was
doing
it
for
you
thought
i
understood
you
thought
i
would
be
willing
to
be
a
party
to
such
an
awful
thing
as
you
have
done
hazel
eyes
were
flashing
fire
now
the
tears
were
scorched
away
sit
down
we
talk
it
over
said
the
man
moving
a
great
summer
chair
nearer
to
his
own
his
eyes
were
on
her
face
approvingly
and
he
was
thinking
what
a
beautiful
picture
she
made
in
her
anger
never
said
the
girl
quickly
it
is
not
a
thing
i
could
talk
over
i
do
not
wish
to
speak
of
it
again
i
wish
you
to
leave
this
place
at
once
and
she
turned
with
a
quick
movement
and
fled
up
the
quaint
old
staircase
she
stayed
in
her
room
until
he
left
utterly
refusing
to
see
him
refusing
to
answer
the
long
letters
he
wrote
and
sent
up
to
her
and
finally
after
another
day
he
went
away
but
he
wrote
to
her
several
times
and
came
again
twice
each
time
endeavouring
to
surprise
her
into
talking
with
him
the
girl
grew
to
watch
nervously
every
approach
of
the
daily
stage
which
brought
stray
travellers
from
the
station
four
miles
distant
and
was
actually
glad
when
a
heavy
shut
them
in
and
made
it
unlikely
that
her
unwelcome
visitor
would
venture
again
into
the
country
the
last
time
he
came
hazel
saw
him
descending
from
the
coach
and
without
a
word
to
any
one
although
it
was
almost
supper
time
and
the
early
winter
twilight
was
upon
them
she
seized
her
fur
cloak
and
slipped
down
the
back
stairs
out
through
the
shadows
across
the
road
where
she
surprised
good
amelia
ellen
by
flinging
her
arms
about
her
neck
and
bursting
into
tears
right
in
the
dark
front
hall
for
the
gust
of
wintry
wind
from
the
open
door
blew
the
candle
out
and
amelia
ellen
stood
astonished
and
bewildered
for
a
moment
in
the
blast
of
the
north
wind
with
the
soft
arms
of
the
excited
girl
in
her
furry
wrappings
clinging
about
her
unaccustomed
shoulders
amelia
ellen
had
never
had
many
beautiful
things
in
her
life
the
care
of
her
mistress
and
her
brilliant
garden
of
flowers
having
been
the
crowning
of
her
life
hitherto
this
beautiful
city
girl
with
her
exquisite
garments
and
her
face
like
a
flower
flung
upon
her
in
sudden
appeal
drew
out
all
the
latent
love
and
pity
and
sympathy
of
which
amelia
ellen
had
a
larger
store
than
most
hidden
under
a
simple
and
severe
exterior
fer
the
land
sake
whatever
ails
you
she
exclaimed
when
she
could
speak
for
astonishment
and
to
her
own
surprise
her
arm
enclosed
the
sobbing
girl
in
a
warm
embrace
while
with
the
other
hand
she
reached
to
close
the
door
come
right
in
to
my
kitchen
and
set
in
the
big
chair
by
the
cat
and
let
me
give
you
a
cup
o
tea
then
you
can
tell
brownleigh
what
troublin
you
she
know
how
to
talk
to
you
git
you
some
tea
right
away
she
drew
the
shrinking
girl
into
the
kitchen
and
ousting
the
cat
from
a
patchwork
rocker
pushed
her
gently
into
it
it
was
characteristic
of
amelia
ellen
that
she
had
no
thought
of
ministering
to
her
spiritual
needs
herself
but
knew
her
place
was
to
bring
physical
comfort
she
spoke
no
word
save
to
the
cat
admonishing
him
to
mend
his
manners
and
keep
out
from
under
foot
while
she
hurried
to
the
tea
canister
the
bread
box
the
sugar
bowl
and
the
china
closet
soon
a
cup
of
fragrant
tea
was
set
before
the
unexpected
guest
and
a
bit
of
delicate
toast
browning
over
the
coals
to
be
buttered
and
eaten
crisp
with
the
tea
and
the
cat
nestled
comfortably
at
hazel
feet
while
she
drank
the
tea
and
wiped
away
the
tears
you
think
i
a
big
baby
amelia
ellen
cried
hazel
trying
to
smile
shamedly
but
i
just
so
tired
of
the
way
things
go
you
see
somebody
i
do
a
bit
like
has
come
up
from
new
york
on
the
evening
coach
and
i
run
away
for
a
little
while
i
do
know
what
made
me
cry
i
never
cry
at
home
but
when
i
got
safely
over
here
a
big
lump
came
in
my
throat
and
you
looked
so
nice
and
kind
that
i
could
keep
the
tears
back
from
that
instant
amelia
ellen
toasting
fork
in
hand
watching
the
sweet
blue
eyes
and
the
face
that
resembled
a
drenched
pink
bud
after
a
storm
loved
hazel
radcliffe
come
weal
come
woe
amelia
ellen
was
from
henceforth
her
staunch
admirer
and
defendant
never
you
mind
honey
you
just
eat
your
tea
an
run
in
to
brownleigh
an
i
get
my
hood
an
run
over
to
tell

by
night
i
know
and
she
winked
knowingly
at
the
girl
by
way
of
encouragement
well
she
knew
who
the
unwelcome
stranger
from
new
york
was
she
had
keen
eyes
and
had
watched
the
coach
from
her
kitchen
window
as
it
came
in
that
night
hazel
told
her
invalid
friend
all
about
milton
hamar
and
slept
in
the
pleasant
bed
that
amelia
ellen
had
prepared
for
her
with
sheets
of
fragrant
linen
redolent
of
sweet
clover
her
heart
was
lighter
for
the
simple
kindly
advice
and
the
gentle
love
that
had
been
showered
upon
her
she
wondered
as
she
lay
half
dozing
in
the
morning
with
the
faint
odour
of
coffee
and
muffins
penetrating
the
atmosphere
why
it
was
that
she
could
love
this
beautiful
mother
of
her
hero
so
much
more
tenderly
than
she
had
ever
loved
any
other
woman
was
it
because
she
had
never
known
her
own
mother
and
had
longed
for
one
all
her
life
or
was
it
just
because
she
was
dear
mother
she
gave
up
trying
to
answer
the
question
and
went
smiling
down
to
breakfast
and
then
across
the
road
to
face
her
unwelcome
lover
strong
in
the
courage
that
friendly
counsel
had
given
her
milton
hamar
left
before
dinner
having
been
convinced
at
last
of
the
uselessness
of
his
visit
he
hired
a
man
with
a
horse
and
cutter
to
drive
him
across
country
to
catch
the
new
york
evening
express
and
hazel
drew
a
breath
of
relief
and
began
to
find
new
pleasure
in
life
her
father
was
off
on
a
business
trip
for
some
weeks
her
brother
had
gone
abroad
for
the
winter
with
a
party
of
college
friends
there
was
no
real
reason
why
she
should
return
to
new
york
for
some
time
and
she
decided
to
stay
and
learn
of
this
saintly
woman
how
to
look
wisely
on
the
things
of
life
to
her
own
heart
she
openly
acknowledged
that
there
was
a
deep
pleasure
in
being
near
one
who
talked
of
the
man
she
loved
so
the
winter
settled
down
to
business
and
hazel
spent
happy
days
with
her
new
friends
for
amelia
ellen
had
become
a
true
friend
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
the
maid
had
found
the
country
winter
too
lonely
and
hazel
had
found
her
useless
and
sent
her
back
to
town
she
was
learning
by
association
with
amelia
ellen
to
do
a
few
things
for
herself
the
elderly
cousin
whose
years
had
been
a
long
strain
of
scrimping
to
present
a
respectable
exterior
was
only
too
happy
to
have
leisure
and
quiet
to
read
and
embroider
to
her
heart
content
so
hazel
was
free
to
spend
much
time
with
brownleigh
they
read
together
at
least
hazel
did
the
reading
for
the
older
eyes
were
growing
dim
and
had
to
be
guarded
to
prevent
the
terrible
headaches
which
came
at
the
slightest
provocation
and
made
the
days
a
blank
of
suffering
for
the
lovely
soul
where
patience
was
having
its
perfect
work
the
world
of
literature
opened
through
a
new
door
to
the
eager
young
mind
now
books
of
which
she
had
never
heard
were
at
her
hand
new
thoughts
and
feelings
were
stirred
by
them
a
few
friends
who
knew
brownleigh
through
their
summer
visits
and
others
who
had
known
her
husband
kept
her
well
supplied
with
the
latest
and
always
the
best
of
everything
history
biography
essays
and
fiction
but
there
were
also
books
of
a
deep
spiritual
character
and
magazines
that
showed
a
new
world
the
religious
world
to
the
girl
she
read
with
zest
all
of
them
and
enjoyed
deeply
the
pleasant
converse
concerning
each
her
eyes
were
being
opened
to
new
ways
of
living
she
was
beginning
to
know
that
there
was
an
existence
more
satisfying
than
just
to
go
from
one
round
of
amusement
to
another
and
always
more
than
in
any
other
thing
she
read
she
took
a
most
unusual
interest
in
home
missionary
literature
it
was
not
because
it
was
so
new
and
strange
and
like
a
fairy
tale
nor
because
she
knew
her
friend
enjoyed
hearing
all
this
news
so
much
but
because
it
held
for
her
the
story
of
the
man
she
now
knew
she
loved
and
who
had
said
he
loved
her
she
wanted
to
put
herself
into
touch
with
surroundings
like
his
to
understand
better
what
he
had
to
endure
and
why
he
had
not
dared
to
ask
her
to
share
his
life
his
hardship
most
of
all
why
he
had
not
thought
her
worthy
to
suffer
with
him
when
she
grew
tired
of
reading
she
would
go
out
into
the
kitchen
and
help
amelia
ellen
it
was
her
own
whim
that
she
should
learn
how
to
make
some
of
the
good
things
to
eat
for
which
amelia
ellen
was
famous
so
while
her
society
friends
at
home
went
from
one
gay
scene
to
another
dancing
and
frivolling
through
the
night
and
sleeping
away
the
morning
hazel
bared
her
round
white
arms
enveloped
herself
in
a
clean
apron
and
learned
to
make
bread
and
pies
and
gingerbread
and
puddings
and
doughnuts
and
how
to
cook
meats
and
vegetables
and
make
delicious
broths
from
odds
and
ends
and
to
concoct
the
most
delectable
desserts
that
would
tempt
the
frailest
appetite
real
old
country
things
they
were
no
fancy
salads
and
whips
and
froths
that
society
has
hunted
out
to
tempt
its
waning
taste
till
everything
has
palled
she
wrote
to
one
of
her
old
friends
who
demanded
to
know
what
she
was
doing
so
long
up
there
in
the
country
in
the
height
of
the
season
that
she
was
taking
a
course
in
domestic
science
and
happily
recounted
her
menu
of
accomplishments
secretly
her
heart
rejoiced
that
she
was
become
less
and
less
unworthy
of
the
love
of
the
man
in
whose
home
and
at
whose
mother
side
she
was
learning
sweet
lessons
there
came
letters
of
course
from
the
missionary
hazel
stayed
later
in
the
kitchen
the
morning
of
their
arrival
conscious
of
a
kind
of
extra
presence
in
his
mother
room
when
his
letters
arrived
she
knew
the
mother
liked
to
be
alone
with
her
son
letters
and
that
she
saved
her
eyes
from
other
reading
for
them
alone
always
the
older
face
wore
a
kind
of
glorified
look
when
the
girl
entered
after
she
had
been
reading
her
letter
the
letter
itself
would
be
hidden
away
out
of
sight
in
the
bosom
of
her
soft
gray
gown
to
be
read
again
and
again
when
she
was
alone
but
seldom
was
it
brought
out
in
the
presence
of
the
visitor
much
as
the
mother
was
growing
to
love
this
girl
frequently
there
were
bits
of
news
my
son
says
he
is
very
glad
i
am
having
such
delightful
company
this
winter
and
he
wants
me
to
thank
you
from
him
for
reading
to
me
she
said
once
patting
hazel
hand
as
she
tucked
the
wool
robe
about
her
friend
helpless
form
and
again
my
son
is
starting
to
build
a
church
he
is
very
happy
about
it
they
have
heretofore
held
worship
in
a
schoolhouse
he
has
collected
a
good
deal
of
the
money
himself
and
he
will
help
to
put
up
the
building
with
his
own
hands
he
is
going
to
send
me
a
photograph
when
it
is
up
i
would
like
to
be
present
when
it
is
dedicated
it
makes
me
very
proud
to
have
my
son
doing
that
the
next
letter
brought
a
photograph
a
small
snapshot
of
the
canyon
tiny
but
clear
and
distinct
hazel
hand
trembled
when
the
mother
gave
it
to
her
to
look
at
for
she
knew
the
very
spot
she
fancied
it
was
quite
near
the
place
where
they
had
paused
for
water
she
could
feel
again
the
cool
breath
of
the
canyon
the
damp
smell
of
the
earth
and
ferns
and
hear
the
call
of
the
wild
bird
then
one
day
there
came
a
missionary
magazine
with
a
short
article
on
the
work
of
arizona
and
a
picture
of
the
missionary
mounted
on
billy
just
ready
to
start
from
his
little
shack
on
a
missionary
tour
hazel
turning
the
leaves
came
upon
the
picture
and
held
her
breath
with
astonishment
and
delight
then
rapidly
glanced
over
the
article
her
heart
beating
wildly
as
though
she
had
heard
his
voice
suddenly
calling
to
her
out
of
the
distances
that
separated
them
she
had
a
beautiful
time
surprising
the
proud
mother
with
the
picture
and
reading
the
article
from
that
morning
they
seemed
to
have
a
tenderer
tie
between
them
and
once
just
before
hazel
was
leaving
for
the
night
the
mother
reached
out
a
detaining
hand
and
laid
it
on
the
girl
arm
i
wish
my
boy
and
you
were
acquainted
dear
she
said
wistfully
and
hazel
the
rich
colour
flooding
her
face
at
once
replied
hesitatingly
oh
why
i
feel
almost
as
though
we
then
she
kissed
her
friend
on
the
soft
cheek
and
hurried
back
to
the
inn
it
was
that
night
that
the
telegram
came
to
say
that
her
father
had
been
seriously
injured
in
a
railway
accident
and
would
be
brought
home
at
once
she
had
no
time
to
think
of
anything
then
but
to
hurry
her
belongings
together
and
hasten
to
new
york
xii
qualifying
for
service
during
the
six
weeks
lingering
suffering
that
followed
the
accident
hazel
was
never
far
from
her
father
bedside
it
seemed
as
though
a
new
bond
of
understanding
had
come
between
them
he
was
very
low
and
there
was
little
hope
from
the
beginning
as
he
grew
weaker
he
seemed
never
to
want
his
daughter
out
of
sight
and
once
when
he
woke
suddenly
to
find
her
close
beside
him
a
smile
of
relief
spread
over
his
face
and
he
told
her
in
brief
words
that
he
had
dreamed
she
was
lost
again
in
arizona
and
that
he
had
been
searching
for
her
with
the
wild
beasts
howling
all
about
and
wicked
men
prowling
in
dark
caves
he
told
her
how
during
that
awful
time
of
her
disappearance
he
had
been
haunted
by
her
face
as
she
was
a
tiny
baby
after
her
mother
died
and
it
seemed
to
him
he
should
go
mad
if
he
could
not
find
her
at
once
then
to
soothe
him
she
told
him
of
the
missionary
and
how
gently
he
had
cared
for
her
told
him
of
all
the
pleasant
little
details
of
the
way
though
not
of
course
of
his
love
for
her
nor
hers
for
him
perhaps
the
father
with
eyes
keen
from
their
nearness
to
the
other
world
discerned
something
of
her
interest
as
she
talked
for
once
he
sighed
and
said
in
reference
to
the
life
of
sacrifice
the
missionary
was
leading
well
i
do
know
but
such
things
are
more
worth
while
after
all
and
then
with
sudden
impulse
she
told
him
of
her
finding
his
mother
and
why
she
had
wanted
to
go
to
the
country
in
the
middle
of
the
society
season
because
she
wanted
to
know
more
of
the
peaceful
life
this
woman
lived
perhaps
you
will
meet
him
again
who
knows
said
the
father
looking
wistfully
at
his
lovely
daughter
and
then
he
turned
his
head
away
and
sighed
again
as
the
confidence
grew
between
them
she
told
him
one
day
of
milton
hamar
unwelcome
proposal
and
the
indignation
of
the
father
knew
no
bounds
it
was
after
that
she
ventured
to
read
to
him
from
the
little
book
and
to
tell
of
the
worship
held
out
under
the
stars
in
the
desert
it
came
to
be
a
habit
between
them
as
the
days
grew
less
that
she
should
read
the
little
book
and
afterwards
he
would
always
lie
still
as
if
he
were
asleep
it
was
on
the
words
of
the
precious
psalm
that
he
closed
his
eyes
for
the
last
time
in
this
world
and
it
was
the
psalm
that
brought
comfort
to
the
daughter
heart
when
she
came
back
to
the
empty
house
after
the
funeral
her
brother
was
there
it
is
true
but
he
was
afraid
of
death
and
wanted
to
get
back
to
his
world
again
back
to
the
european
trip
where
he
had
left
his
friends
and
especially
a
gay
young
countess
who
had
smiled
upon
him
he
was
impatient
of
death
and
sorrow
hazel
saw
that
he
could
not
comprehend
her
loneliness
so
she
bade
him
go
as
soon
as
decency
would
allow
and
he
was
not
long
in
obeying
her
he
had
had
his
own
way
all
his
life
and
even
death
was
not
to
deny
him
the
work
of
the
trained
nurses
who
had
cared
for
her
father
interested
hazel
deeply
she
had
talked
with
them
about
their
life
and
preparation
for
it
and
when
she
could
no
longer
stand
the
great
empty
house
with
only
aunt
maria
for
company
who
had
come
back
just
before
radcliffe
death
she
determined
to
become
a
nurse
herself
there
was
much
ado
over
her
decision
among
her
acquaintances
and
aunt
maria
thought
it
was
not
quite
respectable
for
her
to
do
so
eccentric
a
thing
and
so
soon
after
her
father
death
she
would
have
preferred
to
have
had
her
run
down
to
lakewood
for
a
few
weeks
and
then
follow
her
brother
across
the
water
for
a
year
or
two
of
travel
but
hazel
was
quite
determined
and
before
january
was
over
she
was
established
in
the
hospital
through
the
influence
of
their
family
physician
and
undergoing
her
first
initiation
it
was
not
easy
thus
to
give
up
her
life
of
doing
exactly
as
she
pleased
when
she
pleased
and
become
a
servant
under
orders
her
back
often
ached
and
her
eyes
grew
heavy
with
the
watching
and
the
ministering
and
she
would
be
almost
ready
to
give
over
then
the
thought
of
the
man
of
the
desert
gave
her
new
courage
and
strength
it
came
to
her
that
she
was
partaking
with
him
in
the
great
work
of
the
kingdom
and
with
this
thought
she
would
rise
and
go
about
the
strange
new
work
again
until
her
interest
in
the
individuals
to
whom
she
ministered
grew
deep
and
she
understood
in
a
measure
the
reason
for
the
glory
in
the
face
of
the
missionary
as
he
spoke
in
the
starlight
about
his
work
often
her
heart
went
out
wistfully
towards
her
invalid
friend
in
new
hampshire
and
she
would
rest
herself
by
writing
a
long
letter
and
would
cherish
the
delicately
written
answers
now
and
again
there
would
be
some
slight
reference
to
my
son
in
these
letters
as
the
spring
came
on
they
were
more
frequent
for
may
would
bring
the
general
assembly
and
the
son
was
to
be
one
of
the
speakers
how
her
heart
throbbed
when
she
read
that
this
was
certain
now
a
few
days
later
when
she
happened
to
read
in
the
daily
paper
some
item
about
assembly
plans
and
discovered
for
the
first
time
that
it
was
to
meet
in
new
york
she
found
herself
in
a
flutter
of
joy
would
it
be
possible
for
her
to
hear
him
speak
that
was
the
great
question
that
kept
coming
and
going
in
her
mind
could
she
arrange
it
so
that
she
would
be
sure
to
be
off
duty
when
his
time
came
to
speak
how
could
she
find
out
about
it
all
thereafter
her
interest
in
the
church
news
of
the
daily
papers
became
deep
then
spring
came
on
with
its
languid
air
and
the
hard
round
of
work
with
often
a
call
to
watch
when
overcome
with
weariness
or
to
do
some
unaccustomed
task
that
tried
her
undisciplined
soul
but
the
papers
were
full
of
the
coming
assembly
and
at
last
the
program
and
his
name
she
laid
her
plans
most
carefully
but
the
case
she
had
been
put
upon
that
week
was
very
low
dying
and
the
woman
had
taken
a
fancy
to
her
and
begged
her
to
stay
by
her
till
the
end
it
was
a
part
of
the
new
hazel
that
she
stayed
though
her
heart
rose
up
in
protest
and
tears
of
disappointment
would
keep
coming
to
her
eyes
the
head
nurse
marked
them
with
disapproval
and
told
the
house
doctor
that
radcliffe
would
never
make
much
of
a
nurse
she
had
no
control
over
her
emotions
death
came
almost
too
late
and
set
her
free
for
the
afternoon
but
it
was
but
half
an
hour
to
the
time
set
for
his
speech
she
was
three
miles
from
the
place
of
meeting
and
still
in
her
uniform
it
was
almost
foolish
to
try
nevertheless
she
hurried
to
her
room
and
slipped
into
a
plain
little
street
suit
the
thing
that
would
go
on
quickest
and
was
away
it
seemed
as
though
every
cab
and
car
and
mode
of
transit
had
conspired
to
hinder
her
and
five
minutes
before
the
time
set
for
the
next
speech
she
hurried
breathless
into
the
dim
hallway
of
a
great
crowded
church
and
pressed
up
the
stairs
to
the
gallery
through
the
silent
leather
doors
that
could
scarcely
swing
open
for
the
crowd
inside
them
and
heard
at
last
voice
she
was
away
up
at
the
top
of
the
gallery
men
and
women
were
standing
close
all
about
her
she
could
not
catch
even
a
glimpse
of
the
platform
with
its
array
of
noble
men
whose
consecration
and
power
and
intellects
had
made
them
great
religious
leaders
she
could
not
see
the
young
commanding
figure
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
platform
nor
catch
the
flash
of
his
brown
eyes
as
he
held
the
audience
in
his
power
while
he
told
the
simple
story
of
his
western
work
but
she
could
hear
the
voice
and
it
went
straight
to
her
lonely
sorrowful
heart
straightway
the
church
with
its
mass
of
packed
humanity
its
arched
and
carven
ceiling
its
magnificent
windows
its
wonderful
organ
and
costly
fittings
faded
from
her
sight
and
overhead
there
arched
a
dome
of
dark
blue
pierced
with
stars
and
mountains
in
the
distance
with
a
canyon
opening
and
a
flickering
fire
she
heard
the
voice
speak
from
its
natural
setting
though
her
eyes
were
closed
and
full
of
tears
he
finished
his
story
amid
a
breathless
silence
on
the
part
of
his
audience
and
then
with
scarcely
a
break
in
his
voice
spoke
to
god
in
one
of
his
uplifting
prayers
the
girl
trembling
almost
sobbing
felt
herself
included
in
the
prayer
felt
again
the
protection
of
an
unseen
presence
felt
the
benediction
in
his
voice
as
he
said
amen
and
echoed
its
utmost
meaning
in
her
soul
the
audience
was
still
hushed
as
the
speaker
turned
to
go
to
his
seat
at
the
back
of
the
platform
a
storm
of
applause
had
been
made
impossible
by
that
prayer
for
heaven
opened
with
the
words
and
god
looked
down
and
had
to
do
with
each
soul
present
but
the
applause
burst
forth
after
all
in
a
moment
for
the
speaker
had
whispered
a
few
words
to
the
moderator
and
was
hurrying
from
the
platform
there
were
cries
of
do
go
tell
us
more
keep
on
till
six
hazel
could
not
see
a
thing
though
she
stretched
her
neck
and
stood
upon
the
tips
of
her
toes
but
she
clasped
her
hands
tightly
together
when
the
applause
came
and
her
heart
echoed
every
sound
the
clamour
ceased
a
moment
as
the
moderator
raised
his
hand
and
explained
that
the
brother
to
whom
they
had
all
been
listening
with
such
pleasure
would
be
glad
to
speak
to
them
longer
but
that
he
was
hastening
away
to
take
the
train
to
see
his
invalid
mother
who
had
been
waiting
for
two
long
years
for
her
boy
a
pause
a
great
sigh
of
sympathy
and
disappointment
and
then
the
applause
burst
forth
again
and
continued
till
the
young
missionary
had
left
the
church
hazel
in
bitter
disappointment
turned
and
slipped
out
she
had
not
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
beloved
face
she
exulted
that
she
had
heard
the
honour
given
him
been
a
part
of
those
who
rejoiced
in
his
power
and
consecration
but
she
could
not
have
him
go
without
having
at
least
one
look
at
him
she
hurried
blindly
down
the
stairs
out
to
the
street
and
saw
a
carriage
standing
before
the
door
the
carriage
door
had
just
been
closed
but
as
she
gazed
he
turned
and
looked
out
for
an
instant
lifting
his
hat
in
farewell
to
a
group
of
ministers
who
stood
on
the
church
steps
then
the
carriage
whirled
him
away
and
the
world
grew
suddenly
blank
she
had
been
behind
the
men
on
the
steps
just
within
the
shadow
of
the
dim
doorway
he
had
not
seen
her
and
of
course
would
not
have
recognized
her
if
he
had
yet
now
she
realized
that
she
had
hoped
oh
what
had
she
not
hoped
from
meeting
him
here
but
he
was
gone
and
it
might
be
years
before
he
came
east
again
he
had
utterly
put
her
from
his
life
he
would
not
think
of
her
again
if
he
did
come
oh
the
loneliness
of
a
world
like
this
why
oh
why
had
she
ever
gone
to
the
desert
to
learn
the
emptiness
of
her
life
when
there
was
no
other
for
her
anywhere
the
days
that
followed
were
very
sad
and
hard
the
only
thought
that
helped
now
was
that
she
too
had
tried
to
give
her
life
for
something
worth
while
as
he
had
done
and
perhaps
it
might
be
accepted
but
there
was
a
deep
unrest
in
her
soul
now
a
something
that
she
knew
she
had
not
got
that
she
longed
inexpressibly
to
have
she
had
learned
to
cook
and
to
nurse
she
was
not
nearly
so
useless
as
when
she
rode
all
upon
the
desert
she
had
overcome
much
of
her
unworthiness
but
there
was
still
one
great
obstacle
which
unfitted
her
for
companionship
and
partnership
with
the
man
of
the
desert
she
had
not
the
something
in
her
heart
and
life
that
was
the
source
and
centre
of
she
was
still
unworthy
there
was
a
long
letter
about
the
first
of
june
from
her
friend
in
new
hampshire
more
shakily
written
she
fancied
than
those
that
had
come
before
and
then
there
came
an
interval
without
any
reply
to
hers
she
had
little
time
however
to
worry
about
it
for
the
weather
was
unusually
warm
and
the
hospital
was
full
her
strength
was
taxed
to
its
utmost
to
fill
her
round
of
daily
duties
aunt
maria
scolded
and
insisted
on
a
vacation
and
finally
in
high
dudgeon
betook
herself
to
europe
for
the
summer
the
few
friends
with
whom
hazel
kept
up
any
intercourse
hurried
away
to
mountains
or
sea
and
the
summer
settled
down
to
business
and
now
in
the
hot
hot
nights
when
she
lay
upon
her
small
bed
too
weary
almost
to
sleep
she
would
fancy
she
heard
again
that
voice
as
he
spoke
in
the
church
or
longer
ago
in
the
desert
and
sometimes
she
could
think
she
felt
the
breeze
of
the
desert
night
upon
her
hot
forehead
the
head
nurse
and
the
house
doctor
decided
radcliffe
needed
a
change
and
suggested
a
few
days
at
the
shore
with
a
convalescing
patient
but
hazel
heart
turned
from
the
thought
and
she
insisted
upon
sticking
to
her
post
she
clung
to
the
thought
that
she
could
at
least
be
faithful
it
was
what
he
would
do
and
in
so
much
she
would
be
like
him
and
worthy
of
his
love
it
was
the
last
thought
in
her
mind
before
she
fainted
on
the
broad
marble
staircase
with
a
tiny
baby
in
her
arms
and
fell
to
the
bottom
the
baby
was
uninjured
but
it
took
a
long
time
to
bring
the
nurse
back
to
consciousness
and
still
longer
to
put
heart
into
her
again
she
is
fit
for
the
work
she
heard
the
biting
tongue
of
the
head
nurse
declare
she
too
frail
and
pretty
and
emotional
she
feels
everybody
troubles
now
i
never
let
a
case
worry
me
in
the
least
and
the
house
doctor
eyed
her
knowingly
and
said
in
his
heart
any
one
would
know
that
but
hazel
listening
was
more
disheartened
than
ever
then
here
too
she
was
failing
and
was
adjudged
unworthy
the
next
morning
there
came
a
brief
blunt
note
from
amelia

tears
too
she
had
noticed
the
transparency
of
the
delicate
flesh
the
frailness
of

wrinkled

woman

heart
she
plannin
to
slip
away
quiet
and
not
bother
him
to
say
it
jest
looks
thet
way
to
me
but
the
next
few
days
the
invalid
brightened
perceptibly
and
hazel
began
to
be
reassured
sweet
converse
they
had
together
and
the
girl
heard
the
long
pleasant
story
of
the
son
visit
home
as
the
mother
dwelt
lovingly
upon
each
detail
telling
it
over
and
over
until
the
listener
felt
that
every
spot
within
sight
of
the
invalid
window
was
fragrant
with
his
memory
she
enjoyed
the
tale
as
much
as
the
teller
and
knew
just
how
to
give
the
answer
that
one
loving
woman
wants
from
another
loving
woman
when
they
speak
of
the
beloved
then
when
the
story
all
was
told
over
and
over
and
there
was
nothing
more
to
tell
except
the
pleasant
recalling
of
a
funny
speech
or
some
tender
happening
hazel
began
to
ask
deeper
questions
about
the
things
of
life
and
eternity
and
step
by
step
the
older
woman
led
her
in
the
path
she
had
led
her
son
through
all
the
years
of
his
childhood
during
this
time
she
seemed
to
grow
stronger
again
there
were
days
when
she
sat
up
for
a
little
while
and
let
them
put
the
meals
on
a
tiny
swinging
table
by
her
chair
and
she
took
a
deep
interest
in
leading
the
girl
to
a
heavenly
knowledge
every
day
she
asked
for
her
writing
materials
and
wrote
for
a
little
while
yet
hazel
noticed
that
she
did
not
send
all
that
she
had
written
in
the
envelope
of
the
weekly
letters
but
laid
it
away
carefully
in
her
writing
portfolio
as
if
it
were
something
yet
unfinished
and
one
evening
in
late
september
when
the
last
rays
of
the
sunset
were
lying
across
the
foot
of
the
wheeled
chair
and
amelia
ellen
was
building
a
bit
of
a
fire
in
the
fireplace
because
it
seemed
chilly
the
mother
called
hazel
to
her
and
handed
her
a
letter
sealed
and
addressed
to
her
son
dear
she
said
gently
i
want
you
to
take
this
letter
and
put
it
away
carefully
and
keep
it
until
i
am
gone
and
then
i
want
you
to
promise
that
if
possible
for
you
to
do
it
you
will
give
it
to
my
son
with
your
own
hands
hazel
took
the
letter
reverently
her
heart
filled
with
awe
and
sorrow
and
stooped
anxiously
over
her
friend
oh
why
she
cried
what
is
the
matter
do
you
feel
worse
you
have
seemed
so
bright
all
day
not
a
bit
said
the
invalid
cheerily
but
i
have
been
writing
this
for
a
long
time
a
sort
of
to
my
boy
and
there
is
nobody
in
the
world
i
would
like
to
have
give
it
to
him
as
well
as
you
will
it
trouble
you
to
promise
me
my
dear
hazel
with
kisses
and
tears
protested
that
she
would
be
glad
to
fulfill
the
mission
but
begged
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
send
for
the
beloved
son
at
once
for
a
sight
of
his
face
she
knew
would
be
good
to
his
mother
at
last
her
fears
were
allayed
though
she
was
by
no
means
sure
that
the
son
ought
not
to
be
sent
for
and
when
the
invalid
was
happily
gone
to
sleep
hazel
went
to
her
room
and
tried
to
think
how
she
might
write
a
letter
that
would
not
alarm
the
young
man
while
yet
it
would
bring
him
to
his
mother
side
she
planned
how
she
would
go
away
herself
for
a
few
days
so
that
he
need
not
find
her
here
she
wrote
several
stiff
little
notes
but
none
of
them
satisfied
her
her
heart
longed
to
write
oh
my
dear
come
quickly
for
your
beloved
mother
needs
you
come
for
my
heart
is
crying
out
for
the
sight
of
you
come
at
once
but
finally
before
she
slept
she
sealed
and
addressed
a
dignified
letter
from
miss
radcliffe
his
mother
trained
nurse
suggesting
that
he
make
at
least
a
brief
visit
at
this
time
as
she
must
be
away
for
a
few
days
and
she
felt
that
his
presence
would
be
a
wise
thing
his
mother
did
not
seem
so
well
as
when
he
was
with
her
then
she
lay
down
comforted
to
sleep
but
the
letter
was
never
sent
in
the
early
dawn
of
the
morning
when
the
faithful
amelia
ellen
slipped
from
her
couch
in
the
alcove
just
off
the
invalid
room
and
went
to
touch
a
match
to
the
carefully
laid
fire
in
the
fireplace
she
passed
the
bed
and
as
had
been
her
custom
for
years
glanced
to
see
if
all
was
well
with
her
patient
at
once
she
knew
that
the
sweet
spirit
of
the
mother
had
fled
with
her
face
slightly
turned
away
a
smile
of
upon
her
lips
and
the
peace
of
god
upon
her
brow
the
mother
had
entered
into
her
rest
xiii
the
call
of
the
desert
hazel
with
her
eyes
blinded
with
tears
and
her
heart
swelling
with
the
loss
of
the
woman
upon
whose
motherliness
she
had
come
to
feel
a
claim
burned
the
letter
she
had
written
the
night
before
and
sent
a
carefully
worded
telegram
her
heart
yearning
with
sympathy
towards
the
bereaved
son
your
dear
mother
has
gone
home
quietly
in
her
sleep
she
did
not
seem
any
worse
than
usual
and
her
last
words
were
of
you
let
us
know
at
once
what
plans
we
shall
make
nurse
radcliffe
that
was
the
telegram
she
sent
poor
amelia
ellen
was
all
broken
up
her
practical
common
sense
for
once
had
fled
her
she
would
do
nothing
but
weep
and
moan
for
the
beloved
invalid
whom
she
had
served
so
long
and
faithfully
it
fell
to
hazel
to
make
all
decisions
though
the
neighbours
and
old
friends
were
most
kind
with
offers
of
help
hazel
waited
anxiously
for
an
answer
to
the
telegram
but
night
fell
and
no
answer
had
come
there
had
been
a
storm
and
something
was
wrong
with
the
wires
the
next
morning
however
she
sent
another
telegram
and
about
noon
still
a
third
with
as
yet
no
response
she
thought
perhaps
he
had
not
waited
to
telegraph
but
had
started
immediately
and
might
be
with
them
in
a
few
hours
she
watched
the
evening
stage
but
he
did
not
come
then
realized
how
her
heart
was
in
a
flutter
and
wondered
how
she
would
have
had
strength
to
meet
him
had
he
come
there
was
the
letter
from
his
mother
and
her
promise
she
had
that
excuse
for
her
presence
of
course
she
could
not
have
left
under
the
circumstances
yet
she
shrank
from
the
meeting
for
it
seemed
somehow
a
breach
of
etiquette
that
she
should
be
the
one
to
break
the
separation
that
he
had
chosen
should
be
between
them
however
he
did
not
come
and
the
third
morning
when
it
became
imperative
that
something
definite
should
be
known
a
telegram
to
the
station
agent
in
arizona
brought
answer
that
the
missionary
was
away
on
a
long
trip
among
some
tribes
of
indians
that
his
exact
whereabouts
was
not
known
but
messengers
had
been
sent
after
him
and
word
would
be
sent
as
soon
as
possible
the
minister
and
the
old
neighbours
advised
with
amelia
ellen
and
hazel
and
made
simple
plans
for
the
funeral
yet
hoped
and
delayed
as
long
as
possible
and
when
at
last
after
repeated
telegrams
there
still
came
the
answer
messenger
not
yet
returned
they
bore
the
body
of
the
woman
to
a
quiet
resting
place
beside
her
beloved
husband
in
the
churchyard
on
the
hillside
where
the
soft
maples
scattered
bright
covering
over
the
new
mound
and
the
sky
arched
high
with
a
kind
of
triumphant
reminder
of
where
the
spirit
was
gone
hazel
tried
to
have
every
detail
just
as
she
thought
he
would
have
liked
it
the
neighbours
brought
of
their
homely
flowers
in
great
quantities
and
some
city
friends
who
had
been
old
summer
boarders
sent
roses
the
minister
conducted
the
beautiful
service
of
faith
and
the
village
children
sang
about
the
casket
of
their
old
friend
who
had
always
loved
every
one
of
them
their
hands
full
of
the
late
flowers
from
her
own
garden
bright
scarlet
and
blue
and
gold
as
though
it
were
a
joyous
occasion
indeed
hazel
had
the
impression
even
as
she
moved
in
the
hush
of
the
presence
of
death
that
she
was
helping
at
some
solemn
festivity
of
deep
joy
instead
of
a
funeral
so
glorious
had
been
the
hope
of
the
one
who
was
gone
so
triumphant
her
faith
in
her
saviour
after
the
funeral
was
over
hazel
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
telling
about
it
all
filling
it
with
sympathy
trying
to
show
their
effort
to
have
things
as
he
would
have
liked
them
and
expressing
deep
sorrow
that
they
had
been
compelled
to
go
on
with
the
service
without
him
that
night
there
came
a
message
from
the
arizona
station
agent
the
missionary
had
been
found
in
a
distant
indian
hogan
with
a
dislocated
ankle
he
sent
word
that
they
must
not
wait
for
him
that
he
would
get
there
in
time
if
possible
a
later
message
the
next
day
said
he
was
still
unable
to
travel
but
would
get
to
the
railroad
as
soon
as
possible
then
came
an
interval
of
several
days
without
any
word
from
arizona
hazel
went
about
with
amelia
ellen
putting
the
house
in
order
hearing
the
beautiful
plaint
of
the
mourning
servant
as
she
told
little
incidents
of
her
mistress
here
was
the
chair
she
sat
in
the
last
time
she
went
to
oversee
the
spring
regulating
and
that
was
john
little
baby
dress
in
which
he
was
christened
his
mother
smoothed
it
out
and
told
her
the
story
of
his
baby
loveliness
one
day
she
had
laid
it
away
herself
in
the
box
with
the
blue
shoes
and
the
crocheted
cap
it
was
the
last
time
she
ever
came
there
was
the
gray
silk
dress
she
wore
to
weddings
and
dinner
parties
before
her
husband
died
and
beneath
it
in
the
trunk
was
the
white
embroidered
muslin
that
was
her
wedding
gown
yellow
with
age
it
was
and
delicate
as
a
spider
web
with
frostwork
of
yellowed
broidery
strewn
quaintly
on
its
ancient
form
and
a
touch
of
real
lace
hazel
laid
a
reverent
hand
on
the
fine
old
fabric
and
felt
as
she
looked
through
the
treasures
of
the
old
trunk
that
an
inner
sanctuary
of
sweetness
had
been
opened
for
her
glimpsing
at
last
a
letter
came
from
the
west
it
was
addressed
to
miss
radcliffe
nurse
in
brownleigh
firm
clear
hand
and
began
dear
madam
hazel
hand
trembled
as
she
opened
it
and
the
dear
madam
brought
the
tears
to
her
eyes
but
then
of
course
he
did
not
know
he
thanked
her
with
all
the
kindliness
and
courtliness
of
his
son
for
her
attendance
on
his
dear
mother
and
told
her
of
many
pleasant
things
his
mother
had
written
of
her
ministrations
he
spoke
briefly
of
his
being
laid
up
lamed
in
the
indian
reservation
and
his
deep
grief
that
he
had
been
unable
to
come
east
to
be
beside
his
mother
during
her
last
hours
but
went
on
to
say
that
it
had
been
his
wish
many
times
expressed
that
he
should
not
leave
his
post
to
come
to
her
and
that
there
need
be
no
sadness
of
farewell
when
she
embarked
and
that
though
it
was
hard
for
him
he
knew
it
was
a
fulfillment
of
his
mother
desires
and
now
that
she
was
gone
and
the
last
look
upon
her
dear
face
was
impossible
he
had
decided
that
he
could
not
bear
it
just
yet
to
come
home
and
see
all
the
dear
familiar
places
with
her
face
gone
he
would
wait
a
little
while
until
he
had
grown
used
to
the
thought
of
her
in
heaven
and
then
it
would
not
be
so
hard
perhaps
he
would
not
come
home
until
next
spring
unless
something
called
him
he
could
not
tell
and
in
any
case
his
injured
ankle
prevented
him
making
the
journey
at
present
no
matter
how
much
he
may
desire
to
do
so
miss
radcliffe
letter
had
told
him
that
everything
had
been
done
just
as
he
would
have
had
it
done
there
was
nothing
further
to
make
it
a
necessity
that
he
should
come
he
had
written
to
his
mother
lawyer
to
arrange
his
mother
few
business
affairs
and
it
only
remained
for
him
to
express
his
deep
gratitude
towards
those
who
had
stood
by
his
dear
mother
when
it
had
been
made
impossible
for
him
to
do
so
he
closed
with
a
request
that
the
nurse
would
give
him
her
permanent
address
that
he
might
be
sure
to
find
her
when
he
found
it
possible
to
come
east
again
as
he
would
enjoy
thanking
her
face
to
face
for
what
she
had
been
to
his
mother
that
was
all
hazel
felt
a
blank
dizziness
settle
down
over
her
as
she
finished
the
letter
it
put
him
miles
away
from
her
again
with
years
perhaps
before
another
sight
of
him
she
suddenly
seemed
fearfully
alone
in
a
world
that
no
longer
interested
her
where
should
she
go
what
to
do
with
her
life
now
back
to
the
hard
grind
of
the
hospital
with
nobody
to
care
and
the
heartrending
scenes
and
tragedies
that
were
daily
enacted
somehow
her
strength
seemed
to
go
from
her
at
the
thought
here
too
she
had
failed
she
was
not
fit
for
the
life
and
the
hospital
people
had
discovered
it
and
sent
her
away
to
nurse
her
friend
and
try
to
get
well
they
had
been
kind
and
talked
about
when
she
should
return
to
them
but
she
knew
in
her
heart
they
felt
her
unfit
and
did
not
want
her
back
should
she
go
back
to
her
home
summon
her
brother
and
aunt
and
plunge
into
society
again
the
very
idea
sickened
her
never
again
would
she
care
for
that
life
she
was
certain
as
she
searched
her
heart
to
see
what
it
was
she
really
craved
if
anything
in
the
whole
wide
world
she
found
her
only
interest
was
in
the
mission
field
of
arizona
and
now
that
her
dear
friend
was
gone
she
was
cut
off
from
knowing
anything
much
about
that
she
gathered
herself
together
after
a
while
and
told
amelia
ellen
of
the
decision
of
brownleigh
and
together
they
planned
how
the
house
should
be
closed
and
everything
put
in
order
to
await
its
master
will
to
return
but
that
night
hazel
could
not
sleep
for
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
her
sad
reflections
came
the
thought
of
the
letter
that
was
left
in
her
trust
it
had
been
forgotten
during
the
strenuous
days
that
had
followed
the
death
of
its
writer
hazel
had
thought
of
it
only
once
and
that
on
the
first
morning
with
a
kind
of
comforting
reflection
that
it
would
help
the
son
to
bear
his
sorrow
and
she
was
glad
that
it
was
her
privilege
to
put
it
into
his
hand
then
the
perplexities
of
the
occasion
had
driven
it
from
her
thoughts
now
it
came
back
like
a
swift
light
in
a
dark
place
there
was
yet
the
letter
which
she
must
give
him
it
was
a
precious
bond
that
would
hold
him
to
her
for
a
little
while
longer
but
how
should
she
give
it
to
him
should
she
send
it
by
mail
no
for
that
would
not
be
fulfilling
the
letter
of
her
promise
she
knew
the
mother
wished
her
to
give
it
to
him
herself
well
then
should
she
write
and
summon
him
to
his
old
home
at
once
tell
him
of
the
letter
and
yet
refuse
to
send
it
to
him
how
strange
that
would
seem
how
could
she
explain
it
to
him
his
whim
might
be
sacred
to
him
would
be
of
course
but
he
would
think
it
strange
that
a
young
woman
should
make
so
much
of
it
as
not
to
trust
the
letter
to
the
mail
now
that
the
circumstances
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
come
on
at
once
neither
would
it
do
for
her
to
keep
the
letter
until
such
a
time
as
he
should
see
fit
to
return
to
the
east
and
look
her
up
it
might
be
years
the
puzzling
question
kept
whirling
itself
about
in
her
mind
for
hours
until
at
last
she
formulated
a
plan
which
seemed
to
solve
the
problem
the
plan
was
this
she
would
coax
amelia
ellen
to
take
a
trip
to
california
with
her
and
on
the
way
they
would
stop
in
arizona
and
give
the
letter
into
the
hands
of
the
young
man
by
that
time
no
doubt
his
injured
ankle
would
be
sufficiently
strong
to
allow
his
return
from
the
journey
to
the
indian
reservation
she
would
say
that
she
was
going
west
and
as
she
had
promised
his
mother
she
would
put
the
letter
into
his
hands
she
had
taken
this
opportunity
to
stop
off
and
keep
her
promise
the
trip
would
be
a
good
thing
for
amelia
ellen
too
and
take
her
mind
off
her
loneliness
for
the
mistress
who
was
gone
eagerly
she
broached
the
subject
to
amelia
ellen
the
next
morning
and
was
met
with
a
blank
face
of
dismay
i
could
noways

but

i
jes
ca
do
it
now
hazel
was
not
a
young
woman
who
was
easily
balked
in
her
plans
when
once
they
were
made
she
was
convinced
that
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
take
this
trip
and
that
amelia
ellen
was
the
only
person
in
the
world
she
wanted
for
a
companion
therefore
she
made
immediate
acquaintance
with
peter
burley
a
thoughtful
stolid
man
who
looked
his
character
of
patient
lover
every
inch
of
him
blue
overalls
and
all
hazel
heart
almost
misgave
her
as
she
unfolded
her
plan
to
his
astonished
ears
and
saw
the
look
of
blank
dismay
that
overspread
his
face
however
he
had
not
waited
all
these
years
to
refuse
his
sweetheart
anything
in
reason
now
he
drew
a
deep
sigh
inquired
how
long
the
trip
as
planned
would
take
allowed
he
could
wait
another
month
ef
that
would
suit
and
turned
patiently
to
his
to
think
his
weary
thoughts
and
set
his
hopes
a
little
further
ahead
then
hazel
heart
misgave
her
she
called
after
him
and
suggested
that
perhaps
he
might
like
to
have
the
marriage
first
and
go
with
them
taking
the
excursion
as
a
wedding
trip
she
would
gladly
pay
all
expenses
if
he
would
but
the
man
shook
his
head
i
could
leave
the
stock
fer
that
long
ennyhow
you
fix
it
thur
ai
no
one
would
know
to
take
my
place
besides
i
never
was
fer
takin
journeys
but
ellen
she
allus
ben
of
a
sprightlier
disposition
an
ef
she
hez
a
hankerin
after
californy
i
be
kinder
more
contented
like
ef
she
sees
first
an
then
settles
down
in
granville
she
better
go
while
she
got
the
chancet
amelia
ellen
succumbed
albeit
with
tears
hazel
could
not
tell
whether
she
was
more
glad
or
sad
at
the
prospect
before
her
whiles
amelia
ellen
wept
and
bemoaned
the
fate
of
poor
burley
and
whiles
she
questioned
whether
there
really
were
any
big
trees
like
what
you
saw
in
the
geographies
with
riding
parties
sitting
contentedly
in
tunnels
through
their
trunks
but
at
last
she
consented
to
go
and
with
many
an
injunction
from
the
admiring
and
envious
neighbours
who
came
to
see
them
off
amelia
ellen
bade
a
sobbing
to
her
solemn
lover
in
the
gray
dawn
of
an
october
morning
climbed
into
the
stage
beside
hazel
and
they
drove
away
into
the
mystery
of
the
great
world
as
she
looked
back
at
her
peter
standing
patient
stooped
and
gray
in
the
familiar
village
street
looking
after
his
departing
sweetheart
who
was
going
out
sightseeing
into
the
world
amelia
ellen
would
almost
have
jumped
out
over
the
wheel
and
run
back
if
it
had
not
been
for
what
the
neighbours
would
say
for
her
heart
was
burley
and
now
that
the
big
trees
were
actually
pulling
harder
than
burley
and
she
had
decided
to
go
and
see
them
burley
began
by
his
very
acquiescence
to
pull
harder
than
the
big
trees
it
was
a
very
teary
amelia
ellen
who
climbed
into
the
train
a
few
hours
later
looking
back
dismally
hopelessly
towards
the
old
stage
they
had
just
left
and
wondering
after
all
if
she
ever
would
get
back
to
granville
safe
and
alive
again
strange
fears
visited
her
of
dangers
that
might
come
to
burley
during
her
absence
which
if
they
did
she
would
never
forgive
herself
for
having
left
him
strange
horrors
of
the
way
of
things
that
might
hinder
her
return
and
she
began
to
regard
her
hitherto
beloved
travelling
companion
with
almost
suspicion
as
if
she
were
a
conspirator
against
her
welfare
however
as
the
miles
grew
and
the
wonders
of
the
way
multiplied
amelia
ellen
began
to
sit
up
and
take
notice
and
to
have
a
sort
of
excited
exultance
that
she
had
come
for
were
they
not
nearing
the
great
famed
west
now
and
would
it
not
soon
be
time
to
see
the
big
trees
and
turn
back
home
again
she
was
almost
glad
she
had
come
she
would
be
wholly
glad
she
had
done
so
when
she
had
got
back
safely
home
once
more
and
so
one
evening
about
sunset
they
arrived
at
the
little
station
in
arizona
which
over
a
year
ago
hazel
had
left
in
her
father
private
car
xiv
home
amelia
ellen
stiff
from
the
unaccustomed
travel
powdered
with
the
dust
of
the
desert
wearied
with
the
excitement
of
travel
and
lack
of
sleep
amid
her
strange
surroundings
stepped
down
upon
the
wooden
platform
and
surveyed
the
magnificent
distance
between
herself
and
anywhere
observed
the
vast
emptiness
with
awful
purpling
mountains
and
limitless
stretches
of
ground
arched
by
a
dome
of
sky
higher
and
wider
and
more
dazzling
than
her
stern
new
hampshire
soul
had
ever
conceived
and
turned
back
to
the
train
which
was
already
moving
away
from
the
little
station
her
first
sensation
had
been
one
of
relief
at
feeling
solid
ground
under
her
feet
once
more
for
this
was
the
first
trip
into
the
world
amelia
ellen
had
ever
made
and
the
cars
bewildered
her
her
second
impulse
was
to
get
back
into
that
train
as
fast
as
her
feet
could
carry
her
and
get
this
awful
journey
done
so
that
she
might
earn
the
right
to
return
to
her
quiet
home
and
her
faithful
lover
but
the
train
was
well
under
way
she
looked
after
it
half
in
envy
it
could
go
on
with
its
work
and
not
have
to
stop
in
this
wild
waste
she
gazed
about
again
with
the
frightened
look
a
child
deserted
gives
before
it
puckers
its
lips
and
screams
hazel
was
talking
composedly
with
the
man
on
the
platform
who
wore
a
wide
felt
hat
and
a
pistol
in
his
belt
he
did
look
even
respectable
to
amelia
ellen
provincial
eyes
and
behind
him
horror
of
horrors
loomed
a
real
live
indian
long
hair
high
cheek
bones
blanket
and
all
just
as
she
had
seen
them
in
the
geography
her
blood
ran
cold
why
oh
why
had
she
ever
been
left
to
do
this
daring
thing
to
leave
civilization
and
come
away
from
her
good
man
and
the
quiet
home
awaiting
her
to
certain
death
in
the
desert
all
the
stories
of
horrid
scalpings
she
had
ever
heard
appeared
before
her
excited
vision
with
a
gasp
she
turned
again
to
the
departing
train
which
had
become
a
mere
speck
on
the
desert
and
even
as
she
looked
vanished
around
a
curve
and
was
lost
in
the
dim
of
a
mountain
poor
amelia
ellen
her
head
reeled
and
her
heart
sank
the
vast
prairie
engulfed
her
as
it
were
and
she
stood
trembling
and
staring
in
dazed
expectancy
of
an
attack
from
earth
or
air
or
sky
the
very
sky
and
ground
seemed
tottering
together
and
threatening
to
extinguish
her
and
she
closed
her
eyes
caught
her
breath
and
prayed
for
peter
it
had
been
her
habit
always
in
any
emergency
to
pray
for
peter
burley
it
was
no
better
when
they
took
her
to
the
across
the
track
she
picked
her
way
among
the
men
and
surveyed
the
long
dining
table
with
its
burden
of
coarse
food
and
its
board
seats
with
disdain
declined
to
take
off
her
hat
when
she
reached
the
room
to
which
the
slatternly
woman
showed
them
because
she
said
there
was
no
place
to
lay
it
down
that
was
fit
scorned
the
simple
bed
refused
to
wash
her
hands
at
the
basin
furnished
for
all
and
made
herself
more
disagreeable
than
hazel
had
dreamed
her
gentle
serviceable
amelia
ellen
ever
could
have
been
no
supper
would
she
eat
nor
would
she
remain
long
at
the
table
after
the
men
began
to
file
in
with
curious
eyes
towards
the
strangers
she
stalked
to
the
rough
unroofed
porch
in
the
front
and
stared
off
at
the
dark
vastness
afraid
of
the
wild
strangeness
afraid
of
the
looming
mountains
afraid
of
the
multitude
of
stars
she
said
it
was
ridiculous
to
have
so
many
stars
it
was
natural
it
was
irreverent
it
was
like
looking
too
close
into
heaven
when
you
were
intended
to
and
then
a
sound
arose
it
made
her
very
hair
stand
on
end
she
turned
with
wild
eyes
and
grasped
hazel
arm
but
she
was
too
frightened
to
utter
a
sound
hazel
had
just
come
out
to
sit
with
her
the
men
out
of
deference
to
the
strangers
had
withdrawn
from
their
customary
smoking
place
on
the
porch
to
the
back
of
the
behind
the
house
they
were
alone
the
two
women
out
there
in
the
dark
with
that
awful
awful
sound
amelia
ellen
white
lips
framed
the
words
indians
but
her
throat
refused
her
sound
and
her
breath
came
short
coyotes
laughed
hazel
secure
in
her
wide
experience
with
almost
a
joyous
ring
to
her
voice
the
sound
of
those
distant
beasts
assured
her
that
she
was
in
the
land
of
her
beloved
at
last
and
her
soul
rejoiced
coy
oh
but
amelia
ellen
voice
was
lost
in
the
recesses
of
her
skimpy
pillow
whither
she
had
fled
to
bury
her
startled
ears
she
had
heard
of
coyotes
but
she
had
never
imagined
to
hear
one
outside
of
a
zoölogical
garden
of
which
she
had
read
and
always
hoped
one
day
to
visit
there
she
lay
on
her
hard
little
bed
and
quaked
until
hazel
laughing
still
came
to
find
her
but
all
she
could
get
from
the
poor
soul
was
a
pitiful
plaint
about
burley
and
what
would
he
say
if
i
was
to
be
et
with
one
of
them
creatures
he
never
forgive
me
never
never
i
lived
i
had
ough
to
come
i
had
ough
to
come
nothing
hazel
could
say
would
allay
her
fears
she
listened
with
horror
as
the
girl
attempted
to
show
how
harmless
the
beasts
were
by
telling
of
her
own
night
ride
up
the
canyon
and
how
nothing
harmed
her
amelia
ellen
merely
looked
at
her
with
frozen
glance
made
fiercer
by
the
flickering
candle
flare
and
answered
dully
an
you
knew
all
an
yet
you
brung
me
it
ai
what
i
thought
you
do
burley
he
never
fergive
me
i
live
ef
i
get
et
up
it
ai
ez
if
i
was
all
alone
in
the
world
you
know
i
got
him
to
think
of
an
i
afford
to
run
no
resks
of
bein
et
you
not
a
wink
of
sleep
did
she
get
that
night
and
when
the
morning
dawned
and
to
the
horrors
of
the
night
were
added
a
telegram
from
a
neighbour
of
burley
saying
that
burley
had
fallen
from
the
haymow
and
broken
his
leg
but
he
sent
his
respects
and
hoped
they
have
a
good
journey
amelia
ellen
grew
uncontrollable
she
declared
she
would
not
stay
in
that
awful
country
another
minute
that
she
would
take
the
first
train
back
back
to
her
beloved
new
hampshire
which
she
never
again
would
leave
so
long
as
her
life
was
spared
unless
burley
went
along
she
would
not
even
wait
until
hazel
had
delivered
her
message
how
could
two
lone
women
deliver
a
message
in
a
land
like
that
never
would
she
ride
drive
or
walk
no
nor
even
set
foot
on
the
sand
of
the
desert
she
would
sit
by
the
track
until
a
train
came
along
and
she
would
not
even
look
further
than
she
need
the
frenzy
of
fear
which
sometimes
possesses
simple
people
at
sight
of
a
great
body
of
water
or
a
roaring
torrent
pouring
over
a
precipice
had
taken
possession
of
her
at
sight
of
the
desert
it
filled
her
soul
with
its
immensity
and
poor
amelia
ellen
had
a
great
desire
to
sit
down
on
the
wooden
platform
and
grasp
firm
hold
of
something
until
a
train
came
to
rescue
her
from
this
awful
emptiness
which
had
tried
to
swallow
her
up
poor
peter
with
his
broken
leg
was
her
weird
cry
one
would
think
she
had
broken
it
with
the
wheels
of
the
car
in
which
she
had
travelled
away
from
him
by
the
way
she
took
on
about
it
and
blamed
herself
the
tragedy
of
a
broken
vow
and
its
consequences
was
the
subject
of
her
discourse
hazel
laughed
then
argued
and
finally
cried
and
besought
but
nothing
could
avail
go
she
would
and
that
speedily
back
to
her
home
when
it
became
evident
that
arguments
and
tears
were
of
no
use
and
that
amelia
ellen
was
determined
to
go
home
with
or
without
her
hazel
withdrew
to
the
front
porch
and
took
counsel
with
the
desert
in
its
morning
brightness
with
the
purple
luring
mountains
and
the
smiling
sky
go
back
on
the
train
that
would
stop
at
the
station
in
half
an
hour
with
the
desert
there
and
the
wonderful
land
and
its
strange
wistful
people
and
not
even
see
a
glimpse
of
him
she
loved
go
back
with
the
letter
still
in
her
possession
and
her
message
still
ungiven
never
surely
she
was
not
afraid
to
stay
long
enough
to
send
for
him
the
woman
who
had
fed
them
and
sheltered
them
for
the
night
would
be
her
protector
she
would
stay
there
must
be
some
woman
of
refinement
and
culture
somewhere
near
by
to
whom
she
could
go
for
a
few
days
until
her
errand
was
performed
and
what
was
her
training
in
the
hospital
worth
if
it
did
not
give
her
some
independence
out
here
in
the
wild
free
west
women
had
to
protect
themselves
she
could
surely
stay
in
the
uncomfortable
quarters
where
she
was
for
another
day
until
she
could
get
word
to
the
missionary
then
she
could
decide
whether
to
proceed
on
her
journey
alone
to
california
or
to
go
back
home
there
was
really
no
reason
why
she
should
not
travel
alone
if
she
chose
plenty
of
young
women
did
and
anyway
the
emergency
was
not
of
her
choosing
amelia
ellen
would
make
herself
sick
fretting
over
her
burley
that
was
plain
if
she
were
detained
even
a
few
hours
hazel
came
back
to
the
nearly
demented
amelia
ellen
with
her
chin
tilted
firmly
and
a
straight
little
set
of
her
sweet
lips
which
betokened
stubbornness
the
train
came
in
a
brief
space
of
time
and
weeping
but
firm
amelia
ellen
boarded
it
dismayed
at
the
thought
of
leaving
her
dear
young
lady
yet
stubbornly
determined
to
go
hazel
gave
her
the
ticket
and
plenty
of
money
charged
the
conductor
to
look
after
her
waved
a
brave
farewell
and
turned
back
to
the
desert
alone
a
brief
conference
with
the
woman
who
had
entertained
them
who
was
also
the
wife
of
the
station
agent
brought
out
the
fact
that
the
missionary
was
not
yet
returned
from
his
journey
but
a
message
received
from
him
a
few
days
before
spoke
of
his
probable
return
on
the
morrow
or
the
day
after
the
woman
advised
that
the
lady
go
to
the
fort
where
visitors
were
always
welcomed
and
where
there
were
luxuries
more
fitted
to
the
stranger
habit
she
eyed
the
dainty
apparel
of
her
guest
enviously
as
she
spoke
and
hazel
keenly
alive
to
the
meaning
of
her
look
realized
that
the
woman
like
the
missionary
had
judged
her
unfit
for
life
in
the
desert
she
was
half
determined
to
stay
where
she
was
until
the
missionary
return
and
show
that
she
could
adapt
herself
to
any
surroundings
but
she
saw
that
the
woman
was
anxious
to
have
her
gone
it
probably
put
her
out
to
have
a
guest
of
another
world
than
her
own
the
woman
told
her
that
a
trusty
indian
messenger
was
here
from
the
fort
and
was
riding
back
soon
if
the
lady
cared
she
could
get
a
horse
and
go
under
his
escort
she
opened
her
eyes
in
wonder
when
hazel
asked
if
there
was
to
be
a
woman
in
the
party
and
whether
she
could
not
leave
her
work
for
a
little
while
and
ride
over
with
them
if
she
would
pay
her
well
for
the
service
oh
you
need
bring
none
o
them
fine
lady
airs
out
here
she
declared
rudely
ai
got
time
fer
no
sech
foolery
you
be
afraid
to
go
back
with
joe
he
takes
care
of
the
women
at
the
fort
he
look
after
you
fine
you
mebbe
kin
hire
a
horse
to
ride
strop
yer
baggage
on
yer
trunk
ye
kin
leave
here
hazel
half
frightened
at
the
position
she
had
allowed
herself
to
be
placed
in
considered
the
woman
words
and
when
she
had
looked
upon
the
indian
stolid
countenance
decided
to
accept
his
escort
he
was
an
old
man
with
furrowed
face
and
sad
eyes
that
looked
as
if
they
could
tell
great
secrets
but
there
was
that
in
his
face
that
made
her
trust
him
she
knew
not
why
an
hour
later
her
most
necessary
baggage
strapped
to
the
back
of
the
saddle
on
a
little
pony
hazel
with
a
sense
of
deep
excitement
mounted
and
rode
away
behind
the
solemn
silent
indian
she
was
going
to
the
fort
to
ask
shelter
until
her
errand
was
accomplished
of
the
only
women
in
that
region
who
would
be
likely
to
take
her
in
she
had
a
feeling
that
the
thing
she
was
doing
was
a
most
wild
and
unconventional
proceeding
and
would
come
under
the
grave
condemnation
of
her
aunt
and
all
her
new
york
friends
she
was
most
thankful
that
they
were
far
away
and
could
not
interfere
for
somehow
she
felt
that
she
must
do
it
anyway
she
must
put
that
letter
with
her
own
hands
into
the
possession
of
its
owner
it
was
a
most
glorious
morning
the
earth
and
the
heavens
seemed
newly
made
for
the
day
hazel
felt
a
gladness
in
her
soul
that
would
not
down
even
when
she
thought
of
poor
amelia
ellen
crouched
in
her
corner
of
the
sleeper
miserable
at
her
desertion
yet
determined
to
go
she
thought
of
the
dear
mother
and
wondered
if
given
to
her
to
know
now
how
she
was
trying
to
fulfill
her
last
wish
it
was
pleasant
to
think
she
knew
and
was
glad
and
hazel
felt
as
though
her
presence
were
near
and
protecting
her
the
silent
indian
made
few
remarks
he
rode
ahead
always
with
a
grave
thoughtful
expression
like
a
student
whose
thoughts
are
not
to
be
disturbed
he
nodded
gravely
in
answer
to
the
questions
hazel
asked
him
whenever
they
stopped
to
water
the
horses
but
he
volunteered
no
information
beyond
calling
her
attention
to
a
lame
foot
her
pony
was
developing
several
times
joe
got
down
and
examined
the
pony
foot
and
shook
his
head
with
a
grunt
of
worried
disapproval
presently
as
the
miles
went
by
hazel
began
to
notice
the
pony
lameness
herself
and
became
alarmed
lest
he
would
break
down
altogether
in
the
midst
of
the
desert
then
what
would
the
indian
do
certainly
not
give
her
his
horse
and
foot
it
as
the
missionary
had
done
she
could
not
expect
that
every
man
in
this
desert
was
like
the
one
who
had
cared
for
her
before
what
a
foolish
girl
she
had
been
to
get
herself
into
this
fix
and
now
there
was
no
father
to
send
out
search
parties
for
her
and
no
missionary
at
home
to
find
her
the
dust
the
growing
heat
of
the
day
and
the
anxiety
began
to
wear
upon
her
she
was
tired
and
hungry
and
when
at
noon
the
indian
dismounted
beside
a
where
the
water
tasted
of
sheep
who
had
passed
through
but
a
short
time
before
and
handed
her
a
package
of
corn
bread
and
cold
bacon
while
he
withdrew
to
the
company
of
the
horses
for
his
own
siesta
she
was
feign
to
put
her
head
down
on
the
coarse
grass
and
weep
for
her
folly
in
coming
out
to
this
wild
country
alone
or
at
least
in
being
so
headstrong
as
to
stay
when
amelia
ellen
deserted
her
then
the
thought
suddenly
occurred
to
her
how
would
amelia
ellen
have
figured
in
this
morning
journey
on
horseback
and
instead
of
weeping
she
fell
to
laughing
almost
hysterically
she
munched
the
corn
bread
the
bacon
she
could
not
eat
and
wondered
if
the
woman
at
the
had
realized
what
an
impossible
lunch
she
had
provided
for
her
guest
however
here
was
one
of
the
tests
she
was
not
worth
much
if
a
little
thing
like
coarse
food
annoyed
her
so
much
she
drank
some
of
the
bitter
water
and
bravely
ate
a
second
piece
of
corn
bread
and
tried
to
hope
her
pony
would
be
all
right
after
his
rest
but
it
was
evident
after
they
had
gone
a
mile
or
two
further
that
the
pony
was
growing
worse
he
lagged
and
limped
and
stopped
and
it
seemed
almost
cruel
to
urge
him
further
yet
what
could
be
done
the
indian
rode
behind
now
watching
him
and
speaking
in
low
grunts
to
him
occasionally
and
finally
they
came
in
sight
of
a
speck
of
a
building
in
the
distance
then
the
indian
spoke
pointing
towards
the
distant
building
which
seemed
too
tiny
for
human
habitation
he
said
aneshodi
hogan
him
friend
me
lady
stay
me
come
back
good
horse
pony
no
go
more
he
bad
dismay
filled
the
heart
of
the
lady
she
gathered
that
her
guide
wished
to
leave
her
by
the
way
while
he
went
on
for
another
horse
and
maybe
he
would
return
and
maybe
not
meantime
what
kind
of
a
place
was
he
leaving
her
in
would
there
be
a
woman
there
even
if
she
were
an
indian
woman
that
would
not
be
so
bad
aneshodi
sounded
as
if
it
might
be
a
woman
name
is
this
aneshodi
a
woman
she
questioned
the
indian
shook
his
head
and
grunted
na
na
aneshodi
aneshodi
him
friend
me
him
good
friend
no
woman
in
scorn
is
there
no
woman
in
the
house
she
asked
anxiously
na
him
heap
good
man
good
hogan
lady
stay
rest
suddenly
her
pony
stumbled
and
nearly
fell
she
saw
that
she
could
not
depend
on
him
for
long
now
could
i
walk
with
you
she
asked
her
eyes
pleading
i
would
rather
walk
than
stay
is
it
far
the
indian
shook
his
head
vigorously
lady
no
walk
many
suns
lady
walk
great
mile
lady
stay
me
ride
fast
back
sundown
and
he
pointed
to
the
sun
which
was
even
now
beginning
its
downward
course
hazel
saw
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
do
as
the
indian
said
and
indeed
his
words
seemed
reasonable
but
she
was
very
much
frightened
what
kind
of
a
place
was
this
in
which
she
was
to
stay
as
they
neared
it
there
appeared
to
be
nothing
but
a
little
shanty
with
a
curiously
familiar
look
as
if
she
had
passed
that
way
before
a
few
chickens
were
picking
about
the
yard
and
a
vine
grew
over
the
door
but
there
was
no
sign
of
human
being
about
and
the
desert
stretched
wide
and
barren
on
every
side
her
old
fear
of
its
vastness
returned
and
she
began
to
have
a
fellow
feeling
with
amelia
ellen
she
saw
now
that
she
ought
to
have
gone
with
amelia
ellen
back
to
civilization
and
found
somebody
who
would
have
come
with
her
on
her
errand
but
then
the
letter
would
have
been
longer
delayed
the
thought
of
the
letter
kept
up
her
courage
and
she
descended
dubiously
from
her
pony
back
and
followed
the
indian
to
the
door
of
the
shanty
the
vine
growing
luxuriantly
over
window
and
casement
and
door
frame
reassured
her
somewhat
she
could
not
tell
just
why
perhaps
somebody
with
a
sense
of
beauty
lived
in
the
ugly
little
building
and
a
man
with
a
sense
of
beauty
could
not
be
wholly
bad
but
how
was
she
to
stay
alone
in
a
man
house
where
no
woman
lived
perhaps
the
man
would
have
a
horse
to
lend
or
sell
them
she
would
offer
any
sum
he
wanted
if
she
only
could
get
to
a
safe
place
but
the
indian
did
not
knock
at
the
door
as
she
had
expected
he
would
do
instead
he
stooped
to
the
lower
step
and
putting
his
hand
into
a
small
opening
in
the
woodwork
of
the
step
fumbled
there
a
minute
and
presently
brought
out
a
key
which
he
fitted
into
the
lock
and
threw
the
door
wide
open
to
her
astonished
gaze
him
friend
me
explained
the
indian
again
he
walked
into
the
room
with
the
manner
of
a
partial
proprietor
of
the
place
looked
about
stooped
down
to
the
fireplace
where
a
fire
was
neatly
laid
and
set
it
blazing
up
cheerfully
took
the
water
bucket
and
filled
it
and
putting
some
water
into
the
kettle
swung
it
over
the
blaze
to
heat
then
turning
he
spoke
again
lady
stay
me
come
back
soon
sun
no
go
down
me
come
back
good
horse
get
lady
but
where
is
the
owner
of
this
house
what
will
he
think
of
my
being
here
when
he
comes
back
said
hazel
more
frightened
than
ever
at
the
prospect
of
being
left
she
had
not
expected
to
stay
entirely
alone
she
had
counted
on
finding
some
one
in
the
house
aneshodi
way
off
not
come
back
one
two
day
mebbe
he
know
me
he
me
friend
lady
stay
all
right
hazel
her
eyes
large
with
fear
watched
her
protector
mount
and
ride
away
almost
she
called
after
him
that
he
must
not
leave
her
then
she
remembered
that
this
was
a
part
of
a
woman
life
in
arizona
and
she
was
being
tried
it
was
just
such
things
as
this
the
missionary
had
meant
when
he
said
she
was
unfit
for
life
out
here
she
would
stay
and
bear
the
loneliness
and
fright
she
would
prove
at
least
to
herself
that
she
had
the
courage
of
any
missionary
she
would
not
bear
the
ignominy
of
weakness
and
failure
it
would
be
a
shame
to
her
all
her
life
to
know
she
had
failed
in
this
trying
time
she
watched
the
indian
riding
rapidly
away
as
if
he
were
in
hot
haste
once
the
suspicion
crossed
her
mind
that
perhaps
he
had
lamed
her
horse
on
purpose
and
left
her
here
just
to
get
rid
of
her
perhaps
this
was
the
home
of
some
dreadful
person
who
would
return
soon
and
do
her
harm
she
turned
quickly
with
alarm
in
her
heart
to
see
what
manner
of
place
she
was
in
for
she
had
been
too
excited
at
first
over
the
prospect
of
being
left
to
notice
it
much
save
to
be
surprised
that
there
were
chairs
a
fireplace
and
a
look
of
comparative
comfort
now
she
looked
about
to
find
out
if
possible
just
what
sort
of
a
person
the
owner
might
be
and
glancing
at
the
table
near
the
fireplace
the
first
object
her
eye
fell
upon
was
an
open
book
and
the
words
that
caught
her
vision
were
he
that
dwelleth
in
the
secret
place
of
the
most
high
shall
abide
under
the
shadow
of
the
almighty
with
a
start
she
turned
the
book
over
and
found
it
was
a
bible
bound
in
plain
strong
covers
with
large
clear
print
and
it
lay
open
as
if
the
owner
had
been
reading
it
but
a
short
time
before
and
had
been
called
suddenly
away
with
a
sigh
of
relief
she
sank
down
in
the
big
chair
by
the
fire
and
let
the
excited
tears
have
their
way
somehow
her
fear
all
vanished
with
that
sentence
the
owner
of
the
house
could
not
be
very
bad
when
he
kept
his
bible
about
and
open
to
that
psalm
her
psalm
her
psalm
and
there
was
assurance
in
the
very
words
themselves
as
if
they
had
been
sent
to
remind
her
of
her
new
trust
in
an
unseen
power
if
she
was
making
the
most
high
her
dwelling
place
continually
surely
she
was
under
his
protection
continually
and
had
no
need
to
be
afraid
anywhere
for
she
was
abiding
in
him
the
thought
gave
her
a
strange
new
sense
of
sweetness
and
safety
after
a
moment
she
sat
up
wiping
away
the
tears
and
began
to
look
around
perhaps
this
was
the
home
of
some
friend
of
her
missionary
she
felt
comforted
about
staying
here
now
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
wall
above
the
mantel
and
lo
there
smiled
the
face
of
her
dear
friend
the
mother
who
had
just
gone
home
to
heaven
and
beneath
it
as
if
that
were
not
enough
to
bring
a
throb
of
understanding
and
joy
to
her
heart
beneath
it
hung
her
own
little
jewelled
riding
whip
which
she
had
left
on
the
desert
a
year
ago
and
forgotten
suddenly
with
a
cry
of
joy
she
rose
and
clasped
her
hands
over
her
heart
relief
and
happiness
in
every
line
of
her
face
it
is
his
home
i
have
come
to
his
own
house
she
cried
and
looked
about
her
with
the
joy
of
discovery
this
then
was
where
he
lived
there
were
his
books
here
his
chair
where
he
sat
and
rested
or
studied
his
hands
had
left
the
bible
open
at
her
psalm
his
psalm
psalm
there
was
his
couch
over
behind
the
screen
and
at
the
other
end
the
tiny
table
and
the
dishes
in
the
closet
everything
was
in
place
and
careful
neatness
reigned
albeit
an
air
of
manlike
uncertainty
about
some
things
she
went
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
big
room
and
back
again
studying
every
detail
revelling
in
the
thought
that
now
whatever
came
to
her
she
might
take
back
with
her
a
picture
of
himself
in
his
own
quiet
room
when
his
work
was
laid
aside
for
a
little
and
when
if
ever
he
had
time
and
allowed
himself
he
perhaps
thought
of
her
time
flew
on
winged
feet
with
the
dear
face
of
her
old
friend
smiling
down
upon
her
and
that
psalm
open
beside
her
on
the
table
she
never
thought
of
fear
and
presently
she
remembered
she
was
hungry
and
went
foraging
in
the
cupboard
for
something
to
eat
she
found
plenty
of
supplies
and
after
she
had
satisfied
her
hunger
sat
down
in
the
great
chair
by
the
fire
and
looked
about
her
in
contentment
with
the
peace
of
the
room
his
room
upon
her
and
the
sweet
old
face
from
the
picture
looking
down
in
benediction
as
if
in
welcome
she
felt
happier
than
since
her
father
had
died
the
quiet
of
the
desert
afternoon
brooded
outside
the
fire
burned
softly
lower
and
lower
at
her
side
the
sun
bent
down
to
the
west
and
long
rays
stole
through
the
window
and
across
at
her
feet
but
the
golden
head
was
drooping
and
the
eyes
were
closed
she
was
asleep
in
his
chair
and
the
dying
firelight
played
over
her
face
then
quietly
without
any
warning
the
door
opened
and
a
man
walked
into
the
room
xv
the
way
of
the
cross
the
missionary
had
been
a
far
journey
to
an
isolated
tribe
of
indians
outside
his
own
reservation
it
was
his
first
visit
to
them
since
the
journey
he
had
taken
with
his
colleague
and
of
which
he
had
told
hazel
during
their
companionship
in
the
desert
he
had
thought
to
go
sooner
but
matters
in
his
own
extended
parish
and
his
trip
east
had
united
to
prevent
him
they
had
lain
upon
his
heart
these
lonely
isolated
people
of
another
age
living
amid
the
past
in
their
ancient
houses
high
up
on
the
cliffs
a
little
handful
of
lonely
primitive
children
existing
afar
knowing
nothing
of
god
and
little
of
man
with
their
strange
simple
ways
and
their
weird
appearance
they
had
come
to
him
in
visions
as
he
prayed
and
always
with
a
weight
upon
his
soul
as
of
a
message
undelivered
he
had
taken
his
first
opportunity
after
his
return
from
the
east
to
go
to
them
but
it
had
not
been
as
soon
as
he
had
hoped
matters
in
connection
with
the
new
church
had
demanded
his
attention
and
then
when
they
were
arranged
satisfactorily
one
of
his
flock
was
smitten
with
a
lingering
illness
and
so
hung
upon
his
friendship
and
companionship
that
he
could
not
with
a
clear
conscience
go
far
away
but
at
last
all
hindrances
subsided
and
he
went
forth
on
his
mission
the
indians
had
received
him
gladly
noting
his
approach
from
afar
and
coming
down
the
steep
way
to
meet
him
putting
their
rude
best
at
his
disposal
and
opening
their
hearts
to
him
no
white
man
had
visited
them
since
his
last
coming
with
his
friend
save
a
trader
who
had
lost
his
way
and
who
knew
little
about
the
god
of
whom
the
missionary
had
spoken
or
the
book
of
heaven
at
least
he
had
not
seemed
to
understand
of
these
things
he
was
as
ignorant
perhaps
as
they
the
missionary
entered
into
the
strange
family
life
of
the
tribe
who
inhabited
the
vast
palace
of
rock
carved
high
at
the
top
of
the
cliff
he
laughed
with
them
ate
with
them
slept
with
them
and
in
every
way
gained
their
full
confidence
he
played
with
their
little
children
teaching
them
many
new
games
and
amusing
tricks
and
praising
the
quick
wits
of
the
little
ones
while
their
elders
stood
about
the
stolid
look
of
their
dusky
faces
relaxed
into
smiles
of
deep
interest
and
admiration
and
then
at
night
he
told
them
of
the
god
who
set
the
stars
above
them
who
made
the
earth
and
them
and
loved
them
and
of
jesus
his
only
son
who
came
to
die
for
them
and
who
would
not
only
be
their
saviour
but
their
loving
companion
by
day
and
by
night
unseen
but
always
at
hand
caring
for
each
one
of
his
children
individually
knowing
their
joys
and
their
sorrows
gradually
he
made
them
understand
that
he
was
the
servant
the
messenger
of
this
christ
and
had
come
there
for
the
express
purpose
of
helping
them
to
know
their
unseen
friend
around
the
under
the
starry
dome
or
on
the
sunny
plain
whenever
he
taught
them
they
listened
their
faces
losing
the
wild
look
of
the
uncivilized
and
taking
on
the
hidden
longing
that
all
mortals
have
in
common
he
saw
the
humanity
in
them
looking
wistfully
through
their
great
eyes
and
gave
himself
to
teach
them
sometimes
as
he
talked
he
would
lift
his
face
to
the
sky
and
close
his
eyes
and
they
would
listen
with
awe
as
he
spoke
to
his
father
in
heaven
they
watched
him
at
first
and
looked
up
as
if
they
half
expected
to
see
the
unseen
world
open
before
their
wondering
gaze
but
gradually
the
spirit
of
devotion
claimed
them
and
they
closed
their
eyes
with
him
and
who
shall
say
if
the
savage
prayers
within
their
breasts
were
not
more
acceptable
to
the
father
than
many
a
wordy
petition
put
up
in
the
temples
of
civilization
seven
days
and
nights
he
abode
with
them
and
they
fain
would
have
claimed
him
for
their
own
and
begged
him
to
give
up
all
other
places
and
live
there
always
they
would
give
him
of
their
best
he
would
not
need
to
work
for
they
would
give
him
his
portion
and
make
him
a
home
as
he
should
direct
them
in
short
they
would
enshrine
him
in
their
hearts
as
a
kind
of
representing
to
their
childish
minds
the
true
and
only
one
the
knowledge
of
whom
he
had
brought
to
them
but
he
told
them
of
his
work
of
why
he
must
go
back
to
it
and
sadly
they
prepared
to
bid
him
with
many
an
invitation
for
return
in
going
down
the
cliff
where
he
had
gone
with
them
many
a
time
before
he
turned
to
wave
another
farewell
to
a
little
child
who
had
been
his
special
pet
and
turning
slipped
and
wrenched
his
ankle
so
badly
that
he
could
not
move
on
they
carried
him
up
to
their
home
again
half
sorrowful
but
wholly
triumphant
he
was
theirs
for
a
little
longer
and
there
were
more
stories
he
could
tell
the
book
of
heaven
was
a
large
one
and
they
wanted
to
hear
it
all
they
spread
his
couch
of
their
best
and
wearied
themselves
to
supply
his
necessity
with
all
that
their
ignorance
imagined
he
needed
and
then
they
sat
at
his
feet
and
listened
the
sprain
was
a
troublesome
one
and
painful
and
it
yielded
to
treatment
but
slowly
meanwhile
the
messenger
arrived
with
the
telegram
from
the
east
they
gathered
about
it
that
sheet
of
yellow
paper
with
its
mysterious
scratches
upon
it
which
told
such
volumes
to
their
friend
but
gave
no
semblance
to
sign
language
of
anything
in
heaven
above
or
earth
beneath
they
looked
with
awe
upon
their
friend
as
they
saw
the
anguish
in
his
countenance
his
mother
was
dead
this
man
who
had
loved
her
and
had
left
her
to
bring
them
news
of
salvation
was
suffering
it
was
one
more
bond
between
them
one
more
tie
of
common
humanity
and
yet
he
could
look
up
and
smile
and
still
speak
to
the
invisible
father
they
saw
his
face
as
it
were
the
face
of
an
angel
with
the
light
of
the
comfort
of
christ
upon
it
and
when
he
read
to
them
and
tried
to
make
them
understand
the
majestic
words
o
death
where
is
thy
sting
o
grave
where
is
thy
victory
they
sat
and
looked
afar
off
and
thought
of
the
ones
that
they
had
lost
this
man
said
they
would
all
live
again
his
mother
would
live
the
chief
they
had
lost
last
year
the
bravest
and
youngest
chief
of
all
their
tribe
he
would
live
too
their
little
children
would
live
all
they
had
lost
would
live
again
so
when
he
would
most
have
wished
to
be
alone
with
his
god
and
his
sorrow
he
must
needs
lay
aside
his
own
bitter
grief
and
bring
these
childish
people
consolation
for
their
griefs
and
in
doing
so
the
comfort
came
to
him
also
for
somehow
looking
into
their
longing
faces
and
seeing
their
utter
need
and
how
eagerly
they
hung
upon
his
words
he
came
to
feel
the
presence
of
the
comforter
standing
by
his
side
in
the
dark
cave
shadows
whispering
to
his
heart
sweet
words
that
he
long
had
known
but
had
not
fully
comprehended
because
his
need
for
them
had
never
come
before
somehow
time
and
things
of
earth
receded
and
only
heaven
and
immortal
souls
mattered
he
was
lifted
above
his
own
loss
and
into
the
joy
of
the
inheritance
of
the
servant
of
the
lord
but
the
time
had
come
all
too
soon
for
his
hosts
when
he
was
able
to
go
on
his
way
and
most
anxious
he
was
to
be
started
longing
for
further
news
of
the
dear
one
who
was
gone
from
him
they
followed
him
in
sorrowful
procession
far
into
the
plain
to
see
him
on
his
way
and
then
returned
to
their
mesa
and
their
cliff
home
to
talk
of
it
all
and
wonder
alone
upon
the
desert
at
last
the
three
great
mesas
like
fingers
of
a
giant
hand
stretching
cloudily
behind
him
the
purpling
mountains
in
the
distance
the
sunlight
shining
vividly
down
over
all
the
bright
sands
the
full
sense
of
his
loss
came
at
last
upon
him
and
his
spirit
was
bowed
with
the
weight
of
it
the
vision
of
the
mount
was
passed
and
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
life
was
upon
him
it
came
to
him
what
it
would
be
to
have
no
more
of
his
mother
letters
to
cheer
his
loneliness
no
thought
of
her
at
home
thinking
of
him
no
looking
forward
to
another
as
he
rode
he
saw
none
of
the
changing
landscape
by
the
way
but
only
the
granville
orchard
with
its
showering
pink
and
white
and
his
mother
lying
happily
beside
him
on
the
strawberry
bank
picking
the
sweet
vivid
berries
and
smiling
back
to
him
as
if
she
had
been
a
girl
he
was
glad
glad
he
had
that
memory
of
her
and
she
had
seemed
so
well
so
very
well
he
had
been
thinking
that
perhaps
when
there
was
hope
of
building
a
little
addition
to
his
shack
and
making
a
possible
place
of
comfort
for
her
that
he
might
venture
to
propose
that
she
come
out
to
him
and
stay
it
was
a
wish
that
had
been
growing
growing
in
his
lonely
heart
since
that
visit
home
when
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
from
her
and
go
back
and
yet
knew
that
he
could
not
stay
would
not
want
to
stay
because
of
his
beloved
work
and
now
it
was
over
forever
his
dream
she
would
never
come
to
cheer
his
home
and
he
would
always
have
to
live
a
lonely
life
for
he
knew
in
his
heart
there
was
only
one
girl
in
the
whole
world
he
would
want
to
ask
to
come
and
her
he
might
not
must
not
ask
as
endless
and
as
desolate
as
his
desert
his
future
lay
stretched
out
before
his
mind
for
the
time
his
beloved
work
and
the
joy
of
service
was
sunk
out
of
sight
and
he
saw
only
himself
alone
forsaken
of
all
love
walking
his
sorrowful
way
apart
and
there
surged
over
him
a
great
and
deadly
weakness
as
of
a
spirit
in
despair
in
this
mind
he
lay
down
to
rest
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
rock
about
the
noon
hour
too
weary
in
spirit
and
exhausted
in
body
to
go
further
without
a
sleep
the
faithful
billy
dozed
and
munched
his
portion
not
far
away
and
high
overhead
a
great
eagle
soared
high
and
far
adding
to
the
wide
desolateness
of
the
scene
here
he
was
alone
at
last
for
the
first
time
with
his
grief
and
for
a
while
it
had
its
way
and
he
faced
it
entering
into
his
gethsemane
with
bowed
spirit
and
seeing
nothing
but
blackness
all
about
him
it
was
so
worn
with
the
anguish
of
his
spirit
that
he
fell
asleep
while
he
slept
there
came
to
him
peace
a
dream
of
his
mother
smiling
well
and
walking
with
a
light
free
step
as
he
remembered
her
when
he
was
a
little
boy
and
by
her
side
the
girl
he
loved
how
strange
and
wonderful
that
these
two
should
come
to
him
and
bring
him
rest
and
then
as
he
lay
still
dreaming
they
smiled
at
him
and
passed
on
hand
in
hand
the
girl
turning
and
waving
her
hand
as
if
she
meant
to
return
and
presently
they
passed
beyond
his
sight
then
one
stood
by
him
somewhere
within
the
shelter
of
the
rock
under
which
he
lay
and
spoke
and
the
voice
thrilled
his
soul
as
it
had
never
been
thrilled
in
life
before
lo
am
with
you
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
the
peace
of
that
invisible
presence
descended
upon
him
in
full
measure
and
when
he
awoke
he
found
himself
repeating
the
peace
which
passeth
understanding
and
realizing
that
for
the
first
time
he
knew
what
the
words
meant
some
time
he
lay
quietly
like
a
child
who
had
been
comforted
and
cared
for
wondering
at
the
burden
which
had
been
lifted
glorying
in
the
peace
that
had
come
in
its
place
rejoicing
in
the
presence
that
he
felt
would
be
with
him
always
and
make
it
possible
for
him
to
bear
the
loneliness
at
last
he
turned
his
head
to
see
if
billy
were
far
away
and
was
startled
to
see
the
shadow
of
the
rock
under
which
he
lay
spread
out
upon
the
sand
before
him
the
semblance
of
a
perfect
mighty
cross
for
so
the
jutting
uneven
arms
of
the
rock
and
the
position
of
the
sun
arranged
the
shadows
before
him
the
shadow
of
a
great
rock
in
a
weary
land
the
words
came
to
his
memory
and
it
seemed
to
be
his
voice
repeating
them
as
she
used
to
do
on
sabbath
evenings
when
they
sat
together
in
the
twilight
before
his
bedtime
a
weary
land
it
a
weary
land
now
and
his
soul
had
been
parched
with
the
heat
and
loneliness
he
had
needed
the
rock
as
he
had
never
needed
it
before
and
the
rock
christ
jesus
had
become
a
rest
and
a
peace
to
his
soul
but
there
it
lay
spread
out
upon
the
sand
beside
him
and
it
was
the
way
of
the
cross
the
christ
way
was
always
the
way
of
the
cross
but
what
was
the
song
they
sang
at
that
great
meeting
he
attended
in
new
york
the
way
of
the
cross
leads
home
ah
that
was
it
some
day
it
would
lead
him
home
but
now
it
was
the
way
of
the
cross
and
he
must
take
it
with
courage
and
always
with
that
unseen
but
close
companion
who
had
promised
to
be
with
him
even
to
the
end
of
the
world
well
he
would
rise
up
at
once
strong
in
that
blessed
companionship
cheerfully
he
made
his
preparations
for
starting
and
now
he
turned
billy
head
a
trifle
to
the
south
for
he
decided
to
stop
over
night
with
his
colleague
when
his
grief
and
loneliness
were
fresh
upon
him
it
had
seemed
that
he
could
not
bear
this
visit
but
since
peace
had
come
to
his
soul
he
changed
his
course
to
take
in
the
other
mission
which
was
really
on
his
way
only
that
he
had
purposely
avoided
it
they
made
him
welcome
those
two
who
had
made
a
little
bit
of
earthly
paradise
out
of
their
desert
shack
and
they
compelled
him
to
stay
with
them
and
rest
three
days
for
he
was
more
worn
with
the
journey
and
his
recent
pain
and
sorrow
than
he
realized
they
comforted
him
with
their
loving
sympathy
and
gladdened
his
soul
with
the
sight
of
their
own
joy
albeit
it
gave
him
a
feeling
of
being
set
apart
from
them
he
started
in
the
early
dawn
of
the
day
when
the
morning
star
was
yet
visible
and
as
he
rode
through
the
beryl
air
of
the
dawning
hour
he
was
uplifted
from
his
sadness
by
a
sense
of
the
near
presence
of
christ
he
took
his
way
slowly
purposely
turning
aside
three
times
from
the
trail
to
call
at
the
hogans
of
some
of
his
parishioners
for
he
dreaded
the
as
one
dreads
a
blow
that
is
inevitable
his
picture
awaited
him
in
his
own
room
smiling
down
upon
his
possessions
with
that
dear
look
upon
her
face
and
to
look
at
it
for
the
first
time
knowing
that
she
was
gone
from
earth
forever
was
an
experience
from
which
he
shrank
inexpressibly
thus
he
gave
himself
more
time
knowing
that
it
was
better
to
go
calmly
turning
his
mind
back
to
his
work
and
doing
what
she
would
have
liked
him
to
do
he
camped
that
night
under
the
sheltered
ledge
where
he
and
hazel
had
been
and
as
he
lay
down
to
sleep
he
repeated
the
psalm
they
had
read
together
that
night
and
felt
a
sense
of
the
comfort
of
abiding
under
the
shadow
of
the
almighty
in
visions
of
the
night
he
saw
the
girl
face
once
more
and
she
smiled
upon
him
with
that
glad
welcoming
look
as
though
she
had
come
to
be
with
him
always
she
did
not
say
anything
in
the
dream
but
just
put
out
her
hands
to
him
with
a
motion
of
surrender
the
vision
faded
as
he
opened
his
eyes
yet
so
real
had
it
been
that
it
remained
with
him
and
thrilled
him
with
the
wonder
of
her
look
all
day
he
began
to
ponder
whether
he
had
been
right
in
persistently
putting
her
out
of
his
life
as
he
had
done
bits
of
her
own
sentences
came
to
him
with
new
meaning
and
he
wondered
after
all
if
he
had
not
been
a
fool
perhaps
he
might
have
won
her
perhaps
god
had
really
sent
her
to
him
to
be
his
life
companion
and
he
had
been
too
blind
to
understand
he
put
the
idea
from
him
many
times
with
a
sigh
as
he
mended
the
fire
and
prepared
his
simple
meal
yet
always
her
face
lingered
sweetly
in
his
thoughts
like
balm
upon
his
saddened
spirit
billy
was
headed
towards
home
that
morning
and
seemed
eager
to
get
on
he
had
not
understood
his
master
these
sad
days
something
had
come
over
his
spirits
the
little
horse
neighed
cheerfully
and
started
on
his
way
with
willing
gait
however
lonely
the
master
might
be
home
was
good
with
one
own
stall
and
manger
and
who
might
tell
but
some
presentiment
told
billy
that
the
princess
was
awaiting
them
the
missionary
endeavoured
to
keep
his
thoughts
upon
his
work
and
plans
for
the
immediate
future
but
try
as
he
would
the
face
of
the
girl
kept
smiling
in
between
and
all
the
beauties
of
the
way
combined
to
bring
back
the
ride
he
had
taken
with
her
until
finally
he
let
his
fancy
dwell
upon
her
with
pleasant
thoughts
of
how
it
would
be
if
she
were
his
and
waiting
for
him
at
the
end
of
his
journey
or
better
still
riding
beside
him
at
this
moment
bearing
him
sweet
converse
on
the
way
the
little
shack
stood
silent
familiar
in
the
setting
sunlight
as
he
rode
up
to
the
door
and
gravely
arranged
for
billy
comfort
then
with
his
upward
look
for
comfort
he
went
towards
his
lonely
home
and
opening
the
door
stood
wondering
upon
the
threshold
xvi
the
letter
it
was
only
an
instant
before
she
opened
her
eyes
for
that
subconscious
state
that
warns
even
in
sleep
of
things
that
are
going
on
outside
the
world
of
slumber
told
her
there
was
another
soul
present
she
awakened
suddenly
and
looked
up
at
him
the
rosiness
of
sleep
upon
her
cheeks
and
the
dewiness
of
it
upon
her
eyelids
she
looked
most
adorable
with
the
long
red
slant
of
sunset
from
the
open
door
at
her
feet
and
the
wonder
of
his
coming
in
her
face
their
eyes
met
and
told
the
story
before
brain
had
time
to
give
warning
of
danger
and
need
of
oh
my
darling
the
man
said
and
took
a
step
towards
her
his
arms
outstretched
as
if
he
would
clasp
her
yet
daring
hardly
to
believe
that
it
was
really
herself
in
the
flesh
my
darling
have
you
really
come
to
me
he
breathed
the
question
as
though
its
answer
meant
life
or
death
to
him
she
arose
and
stood
before
him
trembling
with
joy
abashed
now
that
she
was
in
his
presence
in
his
home
unbidden
her
tongue
seemed
tied
she
had
no
word
with
which
to
explain
but
because
he
saw
the
love
in
her
eyes
and
because
his
own
need
of
her
was
great
he
became
bolder
and
coming
closer
he
began
to
tell
her
earnestly
how
he
had
longed
and
prayed
that
god
would
make
a
way
for
him
to
find
her
again
how
he
had
fancied
her
here
in
this
room
his
own
dear
companion
his
wife
he
breathed
the
word
tenderly
reverently
and
she
felt
the
blessing
and
the
wonder
of
the
love
of
this
great
man
then
because
he
saw
his
answer
in
her
eyes
he
came
near
and
took
her
reverently
in
his
arms
laid
his
lips
upon
hers
and
thus
they
stood
for
a
moment
together
knowing
that
after
all
the
sorrow
the
longing
the
separation
each
had
come
into
his
own
it
was
some
time
before
hazel
could
get
opportunity
to
explain
how
she
came
all
unknowingly
to
be
in
his
house
and
even
then
he
could
not
understand
what
joyful
circumstance
had
set
her
face
fortward
and
dropped
her
at
his
door
so
she
had
to
go
back
to
the
letter
the
letter
which
was
the
cause
of
it
all
and
yet
for
the
moment
had
been
forgotten
she
brought
it
forth
now
and
his
face
all
tender
with
the
joy
of
her
presence
grew
almost
glorified
when
he
knew
that
it
was
she
who
had
been
his
mother
tender
nurse
and
beloved
friend
through
the
last
days
of
her
life
with
clasped
hands
they
talked
together
of
his
mother
hazel
told
him
all
how
she
had
come
upon
her
that
summer
day
and
her
heart
had
yearned
to
know
her
for
his
sake
and
how
she
had
gone
back
again
and
yet
again
all
the
story
of
her
own
struggles
for
a
better
life
when
she
told
of
her
cooking
lessons
he
kissed
the
little
white
hands
he
held
and
when
she
spoke
of
her
hospital
work
he
touched
his
lips
to
eyes
and
brow
in
reverent
worshipfulness
and
you
did
all
that
because
he
asked
and
looked
deep
into
her
eyes
demanding
hungrily
his
answer
because
i
wanted
to
be
worthy
of
your
love
she
breathed
softly
her
eyes
her
face
rosy
with
her
confession
oh
my
darling
he
said
and
clasped
her
close
once
more
almost
the
letter
itself
was
forgotten
until
it
slipped
softly
to
the
floor
and
called
attention
to
itself
there
was
really
after
all
no
need
for
the
letter
it
had
done
its
intended
work
without
being
read
but
they
read
it
together
his
arm
about
her
shoulders
and
their
heads
close
each
feeling
the
need
of
the
comforting
love
of
the
other
because
of
the
bereavement
each
had
suffered
and
thus
they
read
my
dear
son
i
am
writing
this
letter
in
what
i
believe
to
be
the
last
few
days
of
my
life
long
ago
i
made
our
dear
doctor
tell
me
just
what
would
be
the
signs
that
preceded
the
probable
culmination
of
my
disease
he
knew
i
would
be
happier
so
for
i
had
some
things
i
wished
to
accomplish
before
i
went
away
i
did
not
tell
you
dear
son
because
i
knew
it
could
but
distress
you
and
turn
your
thoughts
away
from
the
work
to
which
you
belong
i
knew
when
you
came
home
to
me
for
that
dear
last
visit
that
i
had
only
a
little
while
longer
left
here
and
i
need
not
tell
you
what
those
blessed
days
of
your
stay
were
to
me
you
know
without
my
telling
you
perhaps
will
blame
yourself
that
you
did
not
see
how
near
the
end
it
was
and
stay
beside
me
but
john
beloved
i
would
not
have
been
happy
to
have
had
it
so
it
would
have
brought
before
you
with
intensity
the
parting
side
of
death
and
this
i
wished
to
avoid
i
want
you
to
think
of
me
as
gone
to
be
with
jesus
and
with
your
dear
father
besides
i
wanted
the
pleasure
of
giving
you
back
again
to
your
work
before
i
went
away
it
was
because
i
knew
the
end
was
near
that
i
dared
do
a
lot
of
things
that
i
would
have
been
careful
about
otherwise
it
was
in
the
strength
of
the
happiness
of
your
presence
that
i
forced
myself
to
walk
again
that
you
might
remember
your
mother
once
more
on
her
feet
remember
now
when
you
are
reading
this
i
shall
be
walking
the
golden
streets
with
as
strong
and
free
a
gait
as
you
walk
your
desert
dear
so
do
regret
anything
of
the
good
time
we
had
nor
wish
you
had
stayed
longer
it
was
perfect
and
the
good
times
are
not
over
for
us
we
shall
have
them
again
on
the
other
side
some
day
when
there
are
no
more
partings
forever
but
there
is
just
one
thing
that
has
troubled
me
ever
since
you
first
went
away
and
that
is
that
you
are
alone
god
knew
it
was
not
good
for
man
to
be
alone
and
he
has
a
helpmeet
for
my
boy
somewhere
in
the
world
i
am
sure
i
would
be
glad
if
i
might
go
knowing
that
you
had
found
her
and
that
she
loved
you
as
i
loved
your
father
when
i
married
him
i
have
never
talked
much
about
these
things
to
you
because
i
do
not
think
mothers
should
try
to
influence
their
children
to
marry
until
god
sends
the
right
one
and
then
it
is
not
the
mother
who
should
be
the
judge
of
course
but
once
i
spoke
to
you
in
a
letter
you
remember
it
was
after
i
had
met
a
sweet
girl
whose
life
seemed
so
fitted
to
belong
to
yours
you
opened
your
heart
to
me
then
and
told
me
you
had
found
the
one
you
loved
and
would
never
love
another
but
she
was
not
for
you
my
heart
ached
for
you
laddie
and
i
prayed
much
for
you
then
for
it
was
a
sore
trial
to
come
to
my
boy
away
out
there
alone
with
his
trouble
i
had
much
ado
not
to
hate
that
girl
to
whom
you
had
given
your
love
and
not
to
fancy
her
a
most
disagreeable
creature
with
airs
and
no
sense
not
to
recognize
the
man
in
my
son
and
not
to
know
his
beautiful
soul
and
the
worth
of
his
love
but
then
i
thought
perhaps
she
could
help
it
poor
child
that
she
did
know
enough
to
appreciate
you
and
likely
it
was
god
good
leading
that
kept
you
from
her
but
i
have
kept
hoping
that
some
time
he
would
bring
you
to
love
another
who
was
more
worthy
than
she
could
have
been
dear
you
have
never
said
anything
more
about
that
girl
and
i
hope
you
have
forgotten
her
though
sometimes
when
you
were
at
home
i
noticed
that
deep
look
in
your
eyes
and
a
sadness
about
your
lips
that
made
me
tremble
lest
her
memory
was
just
as
bright
as
ever
i
have
wanted
you
to
know
the
sweet
girl
hazel
radcliffe
who
has
been
my
dear
friend
and
almost
daughter
for
no
daughter
could
have
been
dearer
than
she
has
been
to
me
and
i
believe
she
loves
me
too
as
i
love
her
if
you
had
been
nearer
i
would
have
tried
to
bring
you
two
together
at
least
for
once
that
you
might
judge
for
yourselves
but
i
found
out
that
she
was
shy
as
a
bird
about
meeting
any
one
though
she
has
hosts
of
young
men
friends
in
her
new
york
home
and
that
she
would
have
run
away
if
you
had
come
besides
i
could
not
have
given
you
any
reason
but
the
truth
for
sending
for
you
and
i
knew
god
would
bring
you
two
together
if
it
was
his
will
but
i
could
not
go
happy
from
this
earth
without
doing
something
towards
helping
you
just
to
see
her
once
and
so
i
have
asked
her
to
give
you
this
letter
with
her
own
hand
if
possible
and
she
has
promised
to
do
so
you
will
come
home
when
i
am
gone
and
she
will
have
to
see
you
and
when
you
look
on
her
sweet
face
if
you
do
not
feel
as
your
mother
does
about
her
it
is
all
right
dear
son
only
i
wanted
you
just
to
see
her
once
because
i
love
her
so
much
and
because
i
love
you
if
you
could
forget
the
other
and
love
this
one
it
seems
as
though
i
should
be
glad
even
in
heaven
but
if
you
do
not
feel
that
way
when
you
see
her
john
do
mind
my
writing
this
letter
for
it
pleased
me
much
to
play
this
little
trick
upon
you
before
i
left
and
the
dear
girl
must
never
know
unless
indeed
you
love
her
and
then
i
do
not
care
for
i
know
she
will
forgive
me
for
writing
this
silly
letter
and
love
me
just
the
same
dear
boy
just
as
we
never
liked
to
say
when
you
went
away
to
college
but
only
revoir
so
there
wo
be
any
now
only
i
love
you
your
mother
hazel
was
weeping
softly
when
they
finished
the
letter
and
there
were
tears
in
the
eyes
of
the
son
though
they
were
glorified
by
the
smile
that
shone
upon
the
girl
as
he
folded
the
letter
and
said
was
that
a
mother
for
a
fellow
to
have
and
could
i
do
anything
else
than
give
myself
when
she
gave
all
she
had
and
to
think
she
picked
out
the
very
one
for
me
that
i
loved
of
all
the
world
and
sent
her
out
to
me
because
i
was
too
set
in
my
way
to
come
back
after
her
it
is
just
as
if
my
mother
sent
you
down
as
a
gift
from
heaven
to
me
dear
and
their
lips
met
once
more
in
deep
love
and
understanding
the
sun
was
almost
setting
now
and
suddenly
the
two
became
aware
that
night
was
coming
on
the
indian
would
be
returning
and
they
must
plan
what
to
do
brownleigh
rose
and
went
to
the
door
to
see
if
the
indian
were
in
sight
he
was
thinking
hard
and
fast
then
he
came
back
and
stood
before
the
girl
dear
he
said
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
brought
the
quick
colour
to
her
cheeks
it
was
so
wonderful
so
disconcerting
to
be
looked
at
and
spoken
to
in
that
way
she
caught
her
breath
and
wondered
if
it
were
not
a
dream
after
all
dear
another
of
those
deep
searching
looks
this
is
a
big
primitive
country
and
we
do
things
in
a
most
summary
way
out
here
sometimes
you
must
tell
me
if
i
go
too
fast
but
could
you
do
you
think
you
love
me
enough
to
marry
me
at
once
oh
she
breathed
lifting
her
happy
eyes
it
would
be
beautiful
to
never
have
to
leave
you
again
but
you
hardly
know
me
i
am
not
fitted
you
know
you
are
a
great
wonderful
missionary
and
i
i
am
only
a
foolish
girl
who
has
fallen
in
love
with
you
and
ca
ever
be
happy
again
without
you
she
buried
her
face
in
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
cried
happy
shamed
tears
and
he
gathered
her
up
in
his
arms
and
comforted
her
his
face
shining
with
a
glorified
expression
dear
he
said
when
he
could
speak
again
dear
do
you
know
that
is
all
i
want
and
do
ever
talk
that
way
again
about
me
i
am
no
saint
as
you
very
well
find
out
but
i
promise
to
love
and
cherish
you
as
long
as
we
both
shall
live
will
you
marry
me
there
was
a
silence
in
the
little
room
broken
only
by
the
low
crackling
of
the
dying
fire
she
lifted
shy
glad
eyes
to
his
and
then
came
and
laid
her
two
hands
in
his
if
you
are
quite
sure
you
want
me
she
breathed
softly
the
rapture
of
his
face
and
the
tenderness
of
his
arms
assured
her
on
that
point
there
is
just
one
great
regret
i
have
said
the
young
man
lifting
his
eyes
towards
his
mother
picture
if
she
only
could
have
known
it
was
you
that
i
loved
why
did
i
tell
her
your
name
but
then
why
my
dear
i
did
know
your
name
do
you
realize
that
i
have
known
your
name
until
now
i
certainly
did
realize
it
said
hazel
with
rosy
cheeks
it
used
to
hurt
dreadfully
sometimes
to
think
that
even
if
you
wanted
to
find
me
you
would
know
how
to
go
about
it
you
dear
did
you
care
so
much
his
voice
was
deep
and
tender
and
his
eyes
were
upon
her
so
much
she
breathed
softly
but
the
splash
of
red
light
on
the
floor
at
their
feet
warned
them
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
they
turned
to
the
immediate
business
of
the
moment
it
is
wonderful
that
things
are
just
as
they
are
said
brownleigh
in
his
full
joyous
tones
it
certainly
seems
providential
bishop
vail
my
father
old
college
chum
has
been
travelling
through
the
west
on
missionary
work
for
his
church
and
he
is
now
at
the
stopping
place
where
you
spent
last
night
he
leaves
on
the
midnight
train
but
we
can
get
there
long
before
that
time
and
he
will
marry
us
there
is
no
one
i
would
rather
have
had
though
the
choice
should
have
been
yours
are
you
going
to
mind
very
much
being
married
in
this
brief
and
primitive
manner
if
i
minded
those
things
i
should
not
be
worthy
of
your
love
said
hazel
softly
no
i
do
mind
in
the
least
only
i
really
nothing
along
to
get
married
in
nothing
suitable
for
a
wedding
gown
you
be
able
to
remember
me
in
bridal
attire
and
there
wo
be
even
amelia
ellen
for
bridesmaid
she
smiled
at
him
mischievously
you
darling
he
said
laying
his
lips
upon
hers
again
you
need
no
bridal
attire
to
make
you
the
sweetest
bride
that
ever
came
to
arizona
and
i
shall
always
remember
you
as
you
are
now
as
the
most
beautiful
sight
my
eyes
ever
saw
if
there
was
time
to
get
word
to
some
of
my
colleagues
off
at
their
stations
we
should
have
a
wedding
reception
that
would
outrival
your
new
york
affairs
so
far
as
enthusiasm
and
genuine
hearty
good
will
is
concerned
but
they
are
all
from
forty
to
a
hundred
miles
away
from
here
and
it
will
be
impossible
are
you
sure
you
are
not
too
tired
to
ride
back
to
the
stopping
place
he
looked
at
her
anxiously
we
will
hitch
billy
to
the
wagon
and
the
seat
has
good
springs
i
will
put
in
plenty
of
cushions
and
you
can
rest
on
the
way
and
we
will
not
attempt
to
come
back
it
would
be
too
much
for
you
she
began
to
protest
but
he
went
on
no
dear
i
do
mean
we
stay
in
that
little
hole
where
you
spent
last
night
that
would
be
awful
but
what
would
you
say
to
camping
in
the
same
spot
where
we
had
our
last
talk
i
have
been
there
many
times
since
and
often
spend
the
night
there
because
of
its
sweet
association
with
you
it
is
not
far
you
know
from
the
railroad
a
matter
of
a
few
minutes
ride
and
there
is
good
water
we
can
carry
my
little
tent
and
trappings
and
then
take
as
much
of
a
wedding
trip
afterwards
as
you
feel
you
have
strength
for
before
we
return
though
we
shall
have
the
rest
of
our
lives
to
make
one
dear
long
wedding
trip
of
i
hope
will
that
plan
suit
you
oh
it
will
be
beautiful
said
hazel
with
shining
eyes
very
well
then
i
will
get
everything
ready
for
our
start
and
you
must
rest
until
i
call
you
with
that
he
stooped
and
before
she
realized
what
he
was
doing
gently
lifted
her
from
her
feet
and
laid
her
down
upon
his
couch
over
in
the
corner
spreading
a
indian
blanket
over
her
then
he
deftly
stirred
up
the
fire
filled
up
the
kettle
swung
it
back
over
the
blaze
and
with
a
smile
went
out
to
prepare
billy
and
the
wagon
hazel
lay
there
looking
about
her
new
home
with
happy
eyes
noting
each
little
touch
of
refinement
and
beauty
that
showed
the
character
of
the
man
who
had
lived
his
life
alone
there
for
three
long
years
and
wondering
if
it
were
really
herself
the
lonely
little
struggling
nurse
with
the
bitter
ache
in
her
heart
who
was
feeling
so
happy
here
hazel
radcliffe
the
former
new
york
society
girl
rejoicing
ecstatically
because
she
was
going
to
marry
a
poor
home
missionary
and
live
in
a
shanty
how
her
friends
would
laugh
and
sneer
and
how
aunt
maria
would
lift
her
hands
in
horror
and
say
the
family
was
disgraced
but
it
did
not
matter
about
aunt
maria
poor
aunt
maria
she
had
never
approved
of
anything
that
hazel
wanted
to
do
all
her
life
as
for
her
brother
and
here
her
face
took
on
a
shade
of
sadness
her
brother
was
of
another
world
than
hers
and
always
had
been
people
said
he
was
like
his
dead
mother
perhaps
the
grand
man
of
the
desert
could
help
her
brother
to
better
things
perhaps
he
would
come
out
here
to
visit
them
and
catch
a
vision
of
another
kind
of
life
and
take
a
longing
for
it
as
she
had
done
he
could
not
fail
at
least
to
see
the
greatness
of
the
man
she
had
chosen
there
was
great
comfort
to
her
in
this
hour
to
remember
that
her
father
had
been
interested
in
her
missionary
and
had
expressed
a
hope
that
she
might
meet
him
again
some
day
she
thought
her
father
would
have
been
pleased
at
the
choice
she
had
made
for
he
had
surely
seen
the
vision
of
what
was
really
worth
while
in
life
before
he
died
suddenly
her
eyes
turned
to
the
little
square
table
over
by
the
cupboard
what
if
she
should
set
it
she
sprang
up
and
suited
the
action
to
the
thought
almost
as
a
child
might
handle
her
first
pewter
set
hazel
took
the
dishes
from
the
shelves
and
arranged
them
on
the
table
they
were
pretty
china
dishes
with
a
fine
old
sprigged
pattern
of
delicate
flowers
she
recognized
them
as
belonging
to
his
mother
set
and
handled
them
reverently
it
almost
seemed
as
if
that
mother
presence
was
with
her
in
the
room
as
she
prepared
the
table
for
her
first
meal
with
the
beloved
son
she
found
a
large
white
towel
in
the
cupboard
drawer
that
she
spread
on
the
rough
little
table
and
set
the
delicate
dishes
upon
it
two
plates
two
cups
and
saucers
knives
and
forks
two
of
everything
how
it
thrilled
her
to
think
that
in
a
little
while
she
would
belong
here
in
this
dear
house
a
part
of
it
and
that
they
two
would
have
a
right
to
sit
together
at
this
table
through
the
years
there
might
come
hardships
and
disappointments
of
course
there
would
she
was
no
fool
life
was
full
of
disappointments
for
everybody
as
well
as
of
beautiful
surprises
but
come
what
would
she
knew
by
the
thrill
in
her
heart
that
she
would
never
be
sorry
for
this
day
in
which
she
had
promised
to
become
the
wife
of
the
man
of
the
desert
and
she
would
always
cherish
the
memory
of
this
her
first
setting
of
the
little
table
and
let
it
make
all
future
settings
of
that
table
a
holy
ordinance
she
found
a
can
of
soup
in
the
cupboard
and
made
it
hot
in
a
small
saucepan
on
the
fire
and
set
forth
on
the
table
crackers
and
cheese
a
glass
of
jelly
a
small
bottle
of
stuffed
olives
and
some
little
cakes
she
had
brought
with
her
in
her
she
had
thought
she
might
need
something
of
the
sort
when
she
landed
in
arizona
for
there
was
no
telling
but
she
might
have
to
ride
across
the
desert
to
find
her
missionary
and
sure
enough
that
had
been
the
case
it
looked
very
cozy
when
brownleigh
came
in
to
say
that
the
wagon
was
ready
and
he
thought
he
saw
the
indian
in
the
dusk
coming
across
the
plain
but
he
stopped
short
without
speech
for
here
before
him
was
the
picture
which
his
mind
and
heart
had
painted
for
him
many
a
time
this
girl
the
one
girl
in
all
the
earth
for
him
kneeling
beside
his
hearth
and
dishing
up
the
steaming
soup
into
the
hot
dishes
the
firelight
playing
on
her
sweet
face
and
golden
hair
and
every
line
and
motion
of
her
graceful
body
calling
for
his
adoration
so
he
stood
for
one
long
minute
and
feasted
his
hungry
eyes
upon
the
sight
until
she
turned
and
saw
his
heart
in
his
eyes
and
her
own
face
grew
rosy
with
the
joy
and
the
meaning
of
it
all
and
so
they
sat
down
to
their
first
meal
in
the
little
house
together
and
then
having
sent
the
indian
back
to
the
fort
with
a
message
they
took
their
way
forth
in
the
starlight
together
to
begin
their
wedding
journey
xvii
dedication
billy
made
good
time
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
out
all
day
on
parishional
work
but
he
knew
who
he
was
hauling
and
seemed
to
take
deep
satisfaction
in
having
hazel
back
again
for
now
and
again
he
would
turn
back
towards
the
wagon
when
they
stopped
for
water
and
whinny
happily
they
reached
the
stopping
place
about
nine
and
the
news
that
the
missionary
was
going
to
be
married
spread
like
wildfire
among
the
men
and
out
to
the
neighbouring
shacks
in
no
time
a
small
crowd
had
collected
about
the
place
peering
out
of
the
starlit
darkness
hazel
retired
to
the
forlorn
little
chamber
where
she
had
spent
the
night
before
and
rummaged
in
her
trunk
for
bridal
apparel
in
a
few
minutes
she
emerged
into
the
long
where
the
table
had
been
hastily
cleared
and
moved
aside
and
upon
which
the
boarders
were
now
seated
in
long
rows
watching
the
proceedings
curiously
she
was
dressed
in
a
simple
white
muslin
touched
here
and
there
with
exquisite
hand
embroidery
and
tiny
cobwebby
edges
of
real
lace
the
missionary
caught
his
breath
as
he
saw
her
come
out
to
him
and
the
rough
faces
of
the
men
softened
as
they
watched
her
the
bishop
arose
to
meet
her
and
welcomed
her
in
a
fatherly
way
he
had
and
the
woman
who
kept
the
stopping
place
came
following
in
hazel
wake
hastily
wiping
her
hands
on
her
apron
and
casting
it
behind
her
as
she
entered
she
had
been
preparing
an
impromptu
supper
out
of
any
materials
that
happened
to
be
at
hand
but
she
could
not
miss
the
ceremony
if
the
coffee
did
burn
weddings
did
not
come
her
way
every
day
in
the
doorway
his
stolid
face
shining
in
the
glare
of
many
candles
stood
the
indian
from
the
fort
he
had
followed
silently
behind
the
couple
to
witness
the
proceedings
well
knowing
he
would
be
forgiven
by
his
mistress
at
the
fort
when
he
told
his
news
the
missionary
was
well
beloved
and
the
missionary
was
going
to
be
married
what
would
the
four
hundred
of
her
own
select
new
york
circle
have
said
could
they
have
seen
hazel
radcliffe
standing
serene
in
her
simple
gown
with
her
undecked
golden
hair
in
the
midst
of
that
motley
company
of
men
with
only
three
curious
slatternly
women
in
the
background
to
keep
her
company
giving
herself
away
to
a
man
who
had
dedicated
his
life
to
work
in
the
desert
but
hazel
happy
heart
was
serenely
unconscious
of
the
incongruity
of
her
surroundings
and
she
answered
with
a
clear
ring
to
her
voice
as
the
bishop
asked
her
the
questions
i
will
she
was
coming
gladly
to
her
new
home
it
was
her
own
ring
the
ring
she
had
given
him
that
john
brownleigh
put
upon
her
hand
in
token
of
his
loyalty
and
love
for
her
the
ring
that
for
a
whole
year
had
lain
next
his
own
heart
and
comforted
its
loneliness
because
she
had
given
it
and
now
he
gave
it
back
because
she
had
given
him
herself
graciously
she
placed
her
small
white
hand
in
the
rough
awkward
ones
of
the
men
who
came
to
offer
her
congratulations
half
stumbling
over
their
own
feet
in
their
awe
and
wonder
at
her
beauty
it
was
to
them
as
if
an
angel
from
heaven
had
suddenly
dropped
down
and
condescended
to
walk
their
daily
path
in
sight
of
them
all
cheerfully
she
swallowed
the
stale
cake
and
muddy
coffee
that
the
slatternly
landlady
produced
and
afterwards
as
she
was
being
helped
to
get
back
into
her
riding
dress
bestowed
upon
her
a
little
lilac
wool
frock
from
her
trunk
that
the
woman
admired
greatly
from
that
moment
the
landlady
of
the
stopping
place
was
a
new
creature
missions
and
missionaries
had
been
nothing
to
her
through
the
years
but
she
believed
in
them
forever
after
and
donned
her
new
lilac
gown
in
token
of
her
faith
in
christianity
thus
hazel
won
her
first
convert
who
afterwards
proved
her
fidelity
in
time
of
great
trial
and
showed
that
even
a
lilac
gown
may
be
an
instrument
of
good
out
into
the
starlight
together
again
they
rode
with
the
blessing
of
the
bishop
upon
them
and
the
cheers
of
the
men
still
sounding
in
their
ears
i
wish
mother
could
have
known
said
the
bridegroom
as
he
drew
his
bride
close
within
his
arm
and
looked
down
upon
her
nestling
by
his
side
oh
i
think
she
does
said
hazel
as
she
dropped
a
thankful
weary
head
against
his
shoulder
then
the
missionary
stooped
and
gave
his
wife
a
long
tender
kiss
and
raising
his
head
and
lifting
his
eyes
to
the
starlit
sky
he
said
reverently
oh
my
father
i
thank
thee
for
this
wonderful
gift
make
me
worthy
of
her
help
her
never
to
regret
that
she
has
come
to
me
hazel
crept
her
hand
into
his
free
one
and
laid
her
lips
upon
his
fingers
and
prayed
all
quietly
by
herself
for
gladness
so
they
rode
out
to
their
camp
beneath
god
sky
three
days
later
an
indian
on
the
way
to
the
fort
turned
aside
with

whose
price
must
have
cost
the
frugal
new

a
twinge
and
after

thought

wiped
her
spectacles
a
second
time
and
read
it
over
to
see
that

had
made
no
mistake

then
she
set
her
hands
upon

hips
and
surveyed
