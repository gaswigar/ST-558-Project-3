preface
this
book
is
primarily
a
study
of
man
and
ultimately
embraces
all
the
great
qualities
and
problems
of
man
as
a
study
of
man
it
takes
into
consideration
the
characteristics
which
make
man
what
he
is
if
some
readers
do
note
the
absence
of
certain
expressions
familiar
to
them
it
does
not
mean
that
the
author
does
not
feel
or
think
as
many
other
very
much
so
but
in
this
book
an
effort
has
been
made
to
approach
the
problem
of
man
from
a
point
of
view
and
therefore
great
pains
have
been
taken
to
use
words
insufficiently
defined
or
words
with
many
meanings
the
author
has
done
his
utmost
to
use
such
words
as
convey
only
the
meaning
intended
and
in
the
case
of
some
words
such
as
spiritual
there
has
been
superadded
the
word
not
because
the
author
has
any
belief
or
disbelief
in
such
phenomena
there
is
no
need
for
because
some
such
phenomena
exist
no
matter
what
we
may
think
of
them
or
by
what
name
we
call
them
but
because
the
word
spiritual
is
not
scientifically
defined
and
every
individual
understands
and
uses
this
word
in
a
and
private
way
to
be
the
author
has
had
to
indicate
this
element
by
adding
i
repeat
once
again
that
this
book
is
not
a
materialistic
or
a
spiritualistic
is
a
study
of
man
and
therefore
does
and
include
materialistic
as
well
as
spiritual
phenomena
because
only
the
complex
of
these
phenomena
constitutes
the
complex
of
man
the
problem
has
not
been
approached
from
the
point
of
view
of
any
private
doctrine
or
creed
but
from
a
mathematical
an
engineering
point
of
view
which
is
impersonal
and
passionless
it
is
obvious
that
to
be
able
to
speak
about
the
great
affairs
of
man
his
spiritual
moral
physical
economic
social
or
political
status
it
must
first
be
ascertained
what
man
is
his
real
nature
and
what
are
the
basic
laws
of
his
nature
if
we
succeed
in
finding
the
laws
of
human
nature
all
the
rest
will
be
a
comparatively
easy
ethical
social
economic
and
political
status
of
man
should
be
in
accord
with
the
laws
of
his
nature
then
civilization
will
be
a
human
permanent
and
peaceful
before
it
is
useless
to
argue
if
electricity
be
natural
or
of
material
or
of
spiritual
origin
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
do
not
ask
these
questions
in
studying
electricity
we
endeavor
to
find
out
the
natural
laws
governing
it
and
in
handling
live
wires
we
do
not
argue
or
speculate
about
use
rubber
gloves
etc
it
will
be
the
same
with
man
and
the
great
affairs
of
have
first
of
all
to
know
what
man
is
though
this
book
has
been
written
with
scrupulous
care
to
avoid
words
or
terms
of
vague
though
it
often
may
seem
coldly
critical
of
things
metaphysical
it
has
not
been
written
with
indifference
to
that
great
perhaps
the
greatest
urge
of
the
human
craving
for
spiritual
yearning
for
the
higher
potentialities
of
that
which
we
call
mind
soul
and
spirit
it
has
been
written
with
the
deep
desire
to
find
the
source
of
these
qualities
their
scientific
significance
and
a
scientific
proof
of
them
so
that
they
may
be
approached
and
studied
by
the
best
minds
of
the
world
without
the
digressions
and
misinterpretations
that
are
caused
by
the
color
and
the
confusion
of
personal
emotions
and
if
the
book
be
read
with
care
it
will
be
seen
that
though
the
clarifying
definition
of
the
classes
of
life
has
been
chiefly
used
in
the
book
for
its
great
carrying
power
in
the
world
its
greatest
help
will
ultimately
be
in
guiding
the
investigation
the
right
valuation
and
especially
the
control
and
use
of
the
higher
human
powers
in
writing
this
book
i
have
been
not
only
introducing
new
ideas
and
new
methods
of
analysis
but
i
have
been
using
a
tongue
new
to
me
the
original
manuscript
was
very
crude
and
foreign
in
form
and
i
am
greatly
indebted
to
various
friends
for
their
patient
kindness
in
correcting
the
many
errors
of
my
poor
english
i
am
also
under
great
obligations
to
walter
polakov
doctor
of
engineering
for
his
exceedingly
helpful
suggestions
not
only
in
giving
me
a
thorough
criticism
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
engineer
but
also
in
devoting
his
energies
to
organizing
the
first
club
where
these
problems
have
been
discussed
and
criticized
with
great
practical
results
to
all
those
who
have
read
and
criticized

express
my
sincere
appreciation
i
wish
also
to
acknowledge
the
deepest
gratitude
to
my
wife
formerly

edgerly
who
has
found
in
this
discovery
of
the
natural
law
for
the
human
class
of
life
the
solution
of
her
life
long
search
and
who
because
of
her
interest
in
my
work
has
given
me
incomparably
inspiring
help
and
valuable
criticism
it
is
not
an
exaggeration
to
state
that
except
for
her
steady
and
relentless
work
and
time
which
saved
my
this
book
could
not
have
been
produced
in
such
a
comparatively
short
time
walter
polakov
of
new
york
city
industrial
counsellor
and
industrial
engineer
in
new
york
city
has
kindly
consented
at
my
request
to
act
with
my
authority
as
my
representative
to
whom
any
further
queries
should
be
addressed
in
my
absence
from
america
to
all
other
friends
who
have
helped
in
many
personal
ways
i
express
thankfulness
as
i
wish
also
to
thank
john
macrae
the
of
dutton
for
his
unusual
attitude
toward
publishing
the
book
york
chapter
i
introduction
method
and
processes
of
approach
to
a
new
concept
of
life
for
a
while
he
trampled
with
impunity
on
laws
human
and
divine
but
as
he
was
obsessed
with
the
delusion
that
two
and
two
makes
five
he
fell
at
last
a
victim
to
the
relentless
rules
of
humble
arithmetic
remember
o
stranger
arithmetic
is
the
first
of
the
sciences
and
the
mother
of
brandeis
it
is
the
aim
of
this
little
book
to
point
the
way
to
a
new
science
and
science
and
art
of
human
engineering
by
human
engineering
i
mean
the
science
and
art
of
directing
the
energies
and
capacities
of
human
beings
to
the
advancement
of
human
weal
it
need
not
be
argued
in
these
times
that
the
establishment
of
such
a
science
of
human
an
undertaking
of
immeasurable
importance
no
one
can
fail
to
see
that
its
importance
is
supreme
it
is
evident
that
if
such
a
science
is
to
be
established
it
must
be
founded
on
ascertained
must
accord
with
what
is
of
must
be
based
upon
a
just
conception
of
what
man
a
right
understanding
of
man
s
place
in
the
scheme
of
nature
no
one
need
be
told
how
indispensable
it
is
to
have
true
the
things
with
which
we
humans
have
to
deal
everyone
knows
for
example
that
to
mistake
solids
for
surfaces
or
lines
would
wreck
the
science
and
art
of
geometry
anyone
knows
that
to
confuse
fractions
with
whole
numbers
would
wreck
the
science
and
art
of
arithmetic
everyone
knows
that
to
mistake
vice
for
virtue
would
destroy
the
foundation
of
ethics
everyone
knows
that
to
mistake
a
desert
mirage
for
a
lake
of
fresh
water
does
but
lure
the
fainting
traveler
to
dire
disappointment
or
death
now
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
of
all
the
things
with
which
human
beings
have
to
deal
the
most
important
by
far
is
man
women
and
children
it
follows
that
for
us
human
beings
nothing
else
can
be
quite
so
important
as
a
clear
true
just
scientific
concept
of
right
understanding
of
what
we
as
human
beings
really
are
for
it
requires
no
great
wisdom
it
needs
only
a
little
reflection
to
see
that
if
we
humans
radically
misconceive
the
nature
of
we
regard
man
as
being
something
which
he
is
not
whether
it
be
something
higher
than
man
or
thereby
commit
an
error
so
fundamental
and
far
reaching
as
to
produce
every
manner
of
confusion
and
disaster
in
individual
life
in
community
life
and
in
the
life
of
the
race
the
question
we
have
therefore
to
consider
first
of
all
is
fundamentally
what
is
man
what
is
a
man
what
is
a
human
being
what
is
the
defining
or
characteristic
mark
of
humanity
to
this
question
two
answers
and
only
two
have
been
given
in
the
course
of
the
ages
and
they
are
both
of
them
current
one
of
the
answers
is
is
an
animal
a
certain
kind
of
animal
the
other
answer
is
a
mixture
partly
biological
and
partly
mythological
or
partly
biological
and
partly
is
a
combination
or
of
animal
with
something
supernatural
an
important
part
of
my
task
will
be
to
show
that
both
of
these
answers
are
radically
wrong
and
that
beyond
all
things
else
they
are
primarily
responsible
for
what
is
dismal
in
the
life
and
history
of
humankind
this
done
the
question
remains
what
is
man
i
hope
to
show
clearly
and
convincingly
that
the
answer
is
to
be
found
in
the
patent
fact
that
human
beings
possess
in
varying
degrees
a
certain
natural
faculty
or
power
or
capacity
which
serves
at
once
to
give
them
their
appropriate
dignity
as
human
beings
and
to
discriminate
them
not
only
from
the
minerals
and
the
plants
but
also
from
the
world
of
animals
this
peculiar
or
characteristic
human
faculty
or
power
or
capacity
i
shall
call
the
faculty
or
power
or
capacity
what
i
mean
by
will
be
clearly
and
fully
explained
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
and
when
it
has
been
made
clear
the
is
man
be
answered
by
saying
that
man
is
a
being
naturally
endowed
with
a
human
being
is
a
men
women
and
children
constitute
the
class
of
life
there
will
then
remain
the
great
task
of
indicating
and
in
a
measure
sketching
some
of
the
important
ways
in
which
the
true
conception
of
man
as
man
will
transform
our
views
of
human
society
and
the
world
affect
our
human
conduct
and
give
us
a
growing
body
of
scientific
wisdom
regarding
the
welfare
of
mankind
including
all
posterity
the
purpose
of
this
introductory
chapter
is
to
consider
certain
general
matters
of
a
preliminary
indicate
the
spirit
of
the
provide
a
short
course
of
approach
and
clear
the
deck
so
to
speak
and
make
ready
for
action
there
are
two
ways
to
slide
easily
through
life
namely
to
believe
everything
or
to
doubt
everything
both
ways
save
us
from
thinking
the
majority
take
the
line
of
least
resistance
preferring
to
have
their
thinking
done
for
them
they
accept
individual
private
doctrines
as
their
own
and
follow
them
more
or
less
blindly
every
generation
looks
upon
its
own
creeds
as
true
and
permanent
and
has
a
mingled
smile
of
pity
and
contempt
for
the
prejudices
of
the
past
for
two
hundred
or
more
generations
of
our
historical
past
this
attitude
has
been
repeated
two
hundred
or
more
times
and
unless
we
are
very
careful
our
children
will
have
the
same
attitude
toward
us
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
humanity
belongs
to
a
class
of
life
which
to
a
large
extent
determines
its
own
destinies
establishes
its
own
rules
of
education
and
conduct
and
thus
influences
every
step
we
are
free
to
take
within
the
structure
of
our
social
system
but
the
power
of
human
beings
to
determine
their
own
destinies
is
limited
by
natural
law
nature
s
law
it
is
the
counsel
of
wisdom
to
discover
the
laws
of
nature
including
the
laws
of
human
nature
and
then
to
live
in
accordance
with
them
the
opposite
is
folly
a
farmer
must
know
the
natural
laws
that
govern
his
wheat
or
corn
or
cow
as
otherwise
he
will
not
have
satisfactory
crops
or
the
quality
and
abundance
of
milk
he
desires
whereas
the
knowledge
of
these
laws
enables
him
to
produce
the
most
favorable
conditions
for
his
plants
and
animals
and
thereby
to
gain
the
desired
results
humanity
must
know
the
natural
laws
for
humans
otherwise
humans
will
not
create
the
conditions
and
the
customs
that
regulate
human
activities
which
will
make
it
possible
for
them
to
have
the
most
favorable
circumstances
for
the
fullest
human
development
in
life
which
means
the
release
of
the
maximum
energy
and
expression
in
mental
moral
material
and
spiritual
and
all
the
other
great
fields
of
human
activities
resulting
in
happiness
in
life
and
in
and
the
conditions
of
the
earning
of
a
livelihood
influence
and
shape
all
our
mental
processes
and
activities
the
quality
and
the
form
of
human
every
human
achievement
be
it
a
scientific
discovery
a
picture
a
statue
a
temple
a
home
or
a
bridge
has
to
be
conceived
in
the
mind
plan
thought
it
can
be
made
a
reality
and
when
anything
is
to
be
attempted
that
involves
any
number
of
of
coordination
have
to
be
methods
which
have
proven
to
be
the
best
suited
for
such
undertakings
are
engineering
engineering
of
toward
a
complete
every
engineer
has
to
know
the
materials
with
which
he
has
to
work
and
the
natural
laws
of
these
materials
as
discovered
by
observation
and
experiment
and
formulated
by
mathematics
and
mechanics
else
he
can
not
calculate
the
forces
at
his
disposal
he
can
not
compute
the
resistance
of
his
materials
he
can
not
determine
the
capacity
and
requirements
of
his
power
plant
in
short
he
can
not
make
the
most
profitable
use
of
his
resources
lately
in
all
industries
and
particularly
during
the
late
world
war
which
was
itself
a
gigantic
industrial
process
another
factor
manifested
itself
and
proved
to
be
of
the
utmost
importance
namely
the
human
factor
which
is
not
material
but
is
mental
moral
psychological
it
has
been
found
that
maximum
production
may
be
attained
when
and
only
when
the
production
is
carried
on
in
conformity
with
certain
psychological
laws
roughly
determined
by
the
analysis
of
human
nature
except
for
productive
human
labor
our
globe
is
too
small
to
support
the
human
population
now
upon
it
humanity
must
produce
or
perish
production
is
essentially
a
task
for
engineers
it
essentially
depends
upon
the
discovery
and
the
application
of
natural
laws
including
the
laws
of
human
nature
it
is
therefore
not
a
task
for
old
fashioned
philosophical
speculation
nor
for
barren
metaphysical
reasoning
it
is
a
scientific
task
and
involves
the
coordination
and
cooperation
of
all
the
sciences
this
is
why
it
is
an
engineering
task
for
engineering
rightly
understood
is
the
coordinated
of
human
knowledge
gathered
through
the
ages
with
mathematics
as
its
chief
instrument
and
guide
human
engineering
will
embody
the
theory
and
science
and
all
engineering
branches
united
by
a
common
understanding
and
welfare
of
mankind
here
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
that
mathematics
is
not
what
many
people
think
it
is
it
is
not
a
system
of
mere
formulas
and
theorems
but
as
beautifully
defined
by
professor
cassius
keyser
in
his
book
human
worth
of
rigorous
columbia
university
press
mathematics
is
the
science
of
exact
thought
or
rigorous
thinking
and
one
of
its
distinctive
characteristics
is
precision
sharpness
completeness
of
this
quality
alone
is
sufficient
to
explain
why
people
generally
do
not
like
mathematics
and
why
even
some
scientists
bluntly
refuse
to
have
anything
to
do
with
problems
wherein
mathematical
reasoning
is
involved
in
the
meantime
mathematical
philosophy
has
very
little
if
anything
to
do
with
mere
calculations
or
with
numbers
as
such
or
with
formulas
it
is
a
philosophy
wherein
precise
sharp
and
rigorous
thinking
is
essential
those
who
deliberately
refuse
to
think
rigorously
is
connections
where
such
thinking
is
possible
commit
the
sin
of
preferring
the
worse
to
the
better
they
deliberately
violate
the
supreme
law
of
intellectual
rectitude
here
i
have
to
make
it
clear
that
for
the
purpose
of
human
engineering
the
old
concepts
of
matter
space
and
time
are
sufficient
to
start
with
they
are
sufficient
in
much
the
same
way
as
they
have
been
sufficient
in
the
old
science
of
mechanics
figuratively
speaking
human
engineering
is
a
higher
order
of
bridge
aims
at
the
spanning
of
a
gap
in
practical
life
as
well
as
in
knowledge
the
old
meanings
of
matter
space
and
time
were
good
enough
to
prevent
the
collapse
of
a
bridge
the
same
understanding
of
space
and
time
as
used
in
this
book
will
protect
society
and
humanity
from
periodical
collapses
the
old
mechanics
lead
directly
to
such
a
knowledge
of
the
intrinsic
laws
governing
the
universe
as
to
suggest
the
new
mechanics
human
engineering
will
throw
a
new
light
on
many
old
conceptions
and
will
help
the
study
and
understanding
of
matter
space
and
time
in
their
relative
meanings
and
perhaps
will
ultimately
lead
to
an
understanding
of
their
absolute
meanings
philosophy
in
its
old
form
could
exist
only
in
the
absence
of
engineering
but
with
engineering
in
existence
and
daily
more
active
and
far
reaching
the
old
verbalistic
philosophy
and
metaphysics
have
lost
their
reason
to
exist
they
were
no
more
able
to
understand
the
production
of
the
universe
and
life
than
they
are
now
able
to
understand
or
grapple
with
production
as
a
means
to
provide
a
happier
existence
for
humanity
they
failed
because
their
venerated
method
of
speculation
can
not
and
its
place
must
be
taken
by
mathematical
thinking
mathematical
reasoning
is
displacing
metaphysical
reasoning
engineering
is
driving
verbalistic
philosophy
out
of
existence
and
humanity
gains
decidedly
thereby
only
a
few
parasites
and
speculators
will
mourn
the
disappearance
of
their
old
companion
the
world
of
predominating
majority
of
human
welcome
a
philosophy
of
ordered
thought
and
production
the
scientists
all
of
them
have
their
duties
no
doubt
but
they
do
not
fully
use
their
education
if
they
do
not
try
to
broaden
their
sense
of
responsibility
toward
all
mankind
instead
of
closing
themselves
up
in
a
narrow
specialization
where
they
find
their
pleasure
neither
engineers
nor
other
scientific
men
have
any
right
to
prefer
their
own
personal
peace
to
the
happiness
of
mankind
their
place
and
their
duty
are
in
the
front
line
of
struggling
humanity
not
in
the
unperturbed
ranks
of
those
who
keep
themselves
aloof
from
life
if
they
are
indifferent
or
discouraged
because
they
feel
or
think
that
they
know
that
the
situation
is
hopeless
it
may
be
proved
that
undue
pessimism
is
as
dangerous
a
religion
as
any
other
blind
creed
indeed
there
is
very
little
difference
in
kind
between
the
medieval
fanaticism
of
the
holy
inquisition
and
modern
intolerance
toward
new
ideas
all
kinds
of
intellect
must
get
together
for
as
long
as
we
presuppose
the
situation
to
be
hopeless
the
situation
will
indeed
be
hopeless
the
spirit
of
human
engineering
does
not
know
the
word
hopeless
for
engineers
know
that
wrong
methods
are
alone
responsible
for
disastrous
results
and
that
every
situation
can
be
successfully
handled
by
the
use
of
proper
means
the
task
of
engineering
science
is
not
only
to
know
but
to
know
how
most
of
the
scientists
and
engineers
do
not
yet
realize
that
their
united
judgment
would
be
invincible
no
system
or
class
would
care
to
disregard
it
their
knowledge
is
the
very
force
which
makes
the
life
of
humanity
pulsate
if
the
scientists
and
the
engineers
have
had
no
common
base
upon
which
to
unite
a
common
base
must
be
provided
the
pressure
of
life
is
such
that
we
can
not
go
forward
without
their
coordinating
guidance
but
first
there
must
be
the
desire
to
act
one
aim
of
this
book
is
to
furnish
the
required
stimulus
by
showing
that
human
engineering
will
rescue
us
from
the
tangle
of
private
opinions
and
enable
us
to
deal
with
all
the
problems
of
life
and
human
society
upon
a
scientific
basis
if
those
who
know
why
and
how
neglect
to
act
those
who
do
not
know
will
act
and
the
world
will
continue
to
flounder
the
whole
history
of
mankind
and
especially
the
present
plight
of
the
world
show
only
too
sadly
how
dangerous
and
expensive
it
is
to
have
the
world
governed
by
those
who
do
not
know
in
paying
the
price
of
this
war
we
have
been
made
to
realize
that
even
the
private
individual
can
not
afford
to
live
wrapped
up
in
his
own
life
and
not
take
his
part
in
public
affairs
he
must
acquire
the
habit
of
taking
his
share
of
public
responsibility
this
signifies
that
a
very
great
deal
of
very
simple
work
all
pointing
in
the
direction
of
a
greater
work
must
be
done
in
the
way
of
educating
not
engineers
and
scientific
men
only
but
the
general
public
to
cooperate
in
establishing
the
practice
of
human
engineering
in
all
the
affairs
of
human
society
and
life
in
writing
this
book
i
have
had
to
wrestle
with
tremendous
difficulties
in
expressing
new
thoughts
and
in
indicating
new
methods
the
reader
who
stops
to
criticize
words
or
expressions
because
of
their
more
or
less
happy
or
unhappy
use
will
miss
the
whole
point
of
the
work
the
reading
of
it
should
be
done
with
a
view
to
seeing
how
much
can
be
found
in
it
of
what
is
new
and
good
that
may
be
elaborated
further
and
put
into
better
form
this
new
enterprise
is
too
difficult
and
too
vast
for
the
unaided
labor
of
one
is
too
short
the
method
used
in
this
book
in
analysing
life
phenomena
is
essentially
an
engineering
method
and
as
physics
and
mechanics
always
suggest
to
mathematicians
new
fields
for
analysis
it
is
not
improbable
that
human
engineering
will
give
mathematicians
new
and
interesting
fields
for
research
the
humblest
rôle
of
mathematicians
in
human
engineering
may
be
likened
to
that
of
public
accountants
who
put
the
affairs
of
business
in
relation
to
mathematics
bertrand
russell
has
said
logic
is
the
youth
of
mathematics
mathematics
is
the
manhood
of
this
brilliant
of
the
eminent
philosopher
of
mathematics
is
no
doubt
just
and
is
profoundly
significant
the
least
it
can
teach
us
is
that
it
is
useless
to
try
to
find
a
dividing
line
between
logic
and
mathematics
for
no
such
line
exists
to
seek
for
one
serves
merely
to
betray
one
s
ignorance
of
mathematical
philosophy
elsewhere
russell
says
the
hope
of
satisfaction
to
our
more
human
desires
the
hope
of
demonstrating
that
the
world
has
this
or
that
ethical
characteristic
is
not
one
which
so
far
as
i
can
see
philosophy
can
do
anything
whatever
to
by
philosophy
he
means
mathematical
philosophy
that
is
rigorously
scientific
not
vaguely
speculative
i
am
entirely
unable
to
agree
with
him
that
such
a
philosophy
can
make
no
contribution
to
ethics
on
the
contrary
i
contend
and
in
this
book
i
hope
to
show
that
by
mathematical
philosophy
by
rigorously
scientific
thinking
we
can
arrive
at
the
true
conception
of
what
a
human
being
really
is
and
that
in
thus
discovering
the
characteristic
nature
of
man
we
come
to
the
secret
and
source
of
ethics
ethics
as
a
science
will
investigate
and
explain
the
essential
nature
of
man
and
the
obligations
which
the
essential
nature
of
man
imposes
upon
human
beings
it
will
be
seen
that
to
live
righteously
to
live
ethically
is
to
live
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
human
nature
and
when
it
is
clearly
seen
that
man
is
a
natural
being
a
part
of
nature
literally
then
it
will
be
seen
that
the
laws
of
human
only
possible
rules
for
ethical
no
more
and
no
more
than
is
the
law
of
gravitation
for
example
or
any
other
natural
law
it
is
no
cause
for
wonder
that
mathematical
thinking
should
lead
to
such
a
result
for
man
is
a
being
man
s
mind
is
a
and
the
results
of
rigorous
thinking
far
from
being
artificial
fictions
are
natural
revelations
of
natural
law
i
hope
i
have
not
given
the
impression
by
repeated
allusion
to
mathematical
science
that
this
book
is
to
be
in
any
technical
sense
a
mathematical
treatise
i
have
merely
wished
to
indicate
that
the
task
is
conceived
and
undertaken
in
the
mathematical
spirit
which
must
be
the
guiding
spirit
of
human
engineering
for
no
thought
if
it
be
in
spirit
can
be
trusted
and
although
mathematicians
sometimes
make
mistakes
the
spirit
of
mathematics
is
always
right
and
always
sound
whilst
i
do
not
intend
to
trouble
the
reader
with
any
highly
technical
mathematical
arguments
there
are
a
few
simple
mathematical
considerations
which
anyone
of
fair
education
can
understand
which
are
of
exceedingly
great
importance
for
our
purpose
and
to
which
therefore
i
ask
the
reader
s
best
attention
one
of
the
ideas
is
that
of
an
another
one
is
that
of
a
neither
of
them
involves
anything
more
difficult
than
the
most
ordinary
arithmetic
of
the
secondary
school
or
the
counting
house
but
it
will
be
seen
that
they
throw
a
flood
of
light
upon
many
of
the
most
important
human
concerns
because
we
are
human
beings
we
are
all
of
us
interested
in
what
we
call
in
law
in
government
in
jurisprudence
in
ethics
in
philosophy
in
the
natural
sciences
in
economics
in
the
fine
arts
in
the
practical
arts
in
the
production
and
distribution
of
wealth
in
all
the
affairs
affecting
the
welfare
of
mankind
it
is
a
fact
that
all
these
great
matters
are
interdependent
and
interlocking
it
is
therefore
a
fact
of
the
utmost
importance
that
progress
in
each
of
the
cardinal
matters
must
keep
abreast
of
progress
in
the
other
cardinal
matters
in
order
to
keep
a
just
equilibrium
a
proper
balance
and
so
to
maintain
the
integrity
and
continued
prosperity
of
the
whole
complex
body
of
our
social
life
it
is
a
fact
a
fact
of
observation
that
in
some
of
the
great
matters
progress
proceeds
in
accordance
with
one
law
and
one
rate
of
advancement
and
in
others
in
accordance
with
a
very
different
law
and
rate
it
is
a
fact
a
fact
of
observation
and
sad
experience
a
fact
attested
by
all
history
and
made
evident
by
reason
that
owing
to
the
widely
differing
laws
and
rates
of
progress
in
the
great
essential
concerns
of
humanity
the
balance
and
equilibrium
among
the
parts
is
disturbed
the
strain
gradually
increases
until
a
violent
break
ensues
in
the
form
of
social
conflicts
insurrections
revolutions
and
war
it
is
a
fact
that
the
readjustment
that
follows
as
after
an
earthquake
does
indeed
establish
a
kind
of
new
equilibrium
but
it
is
an
equilibrium
born
of
violence
and
it
is
destined
to
be
again
disturbed
periodically
without
end
unless
by
some
science
and
art
of
human
engineering
progress
in
all
the
great
matters
essential
to
human
weal
can
be
made
to
proceed
in
accordance
with
one
and
the
same
law
having
its
validity
in
the
nature
of
man
taken
in
combination
the
facts
just
stated
are
so
extremely
important
that
they
deserve
to
be
stated
with
the
utmost
emphasis
and
clarity
to
this
end
i
beg
the
reader
to
consider
very
carefully
and
side
by
side
the
two
following
series
of
numbers
the
first
one
is
a
simple
geometrical
by
the
second
one
is
a
simple
arithmetical
by
etc
etc
for
convenience
of
comparison
i
let
them
begin
with
the
same
number
and
for
simplicity
i
have
taken
for
this
initial
term
observe
that
in
the
each
term
is
got
from
the
preceding
term
by
by
and
that
in
the
each
term
is
got
from
its
predecessor
by
adding
in
the
first
series
the
multiplier
is
called
the
common
and
in
the
second
series
the
repeatedly
added
is
called
the
common
it
is
again
for
the
convenience
of
comparison
that
i
have
chosen
the
same
number
for
both
common
ratio
and
common
difference
and
for
the
sake
of
simplicity
that
i
have
taken
for
this
number
the
easy
number
other
choices
would
be
logically
just
as
good
why
have
i
introduced
these
two
series
because
they
serve
to
illustrate
perfectly
two
widely
different
of
laws
representing
vastly
different
of
growth
increase
or
do
not
fail
to
observe
in
this
connection
the
following
two
facts
one
of
them
is
that
the
magnitude
of
the
terms
of
any
geometric
progression
whose
ratio
no
matter
how
small
is
or
more
will
overtake
and
surpass
the
magnitude
of
the
corresponding
terms
of
any
arithmetical
progression
no
matter
how
large
the
common
difference
of
the
latter
may
be
the
other
fact
to
be
noted
is
that
the
greater
the
ratio
of
a
geometric
progression
the
more
rapidly
do
its
successive
terms
increase
so
that
the
terms
of
one
geometric
progression
may
increase
a
thousand
or
a
million
or
a
billion
times
faster
than
the
corresponding
terms
of
another
geometric
progression
as
any
geometric
progression
of
ratio
equal
to
or
more
no
matter
how
slow
outruns
every
arithmetic
progression
no
matter
how
fast
so
one
geometric
progression
may
be
far
swifter
than
another
one
of
the
same
type
to
every
one
it
will
be
obvious
that
the
two
progressions
differ
in
pace
and
that
the
difference
between
their
corresponding
terms
becomes
increasingly
larger
and
larger
the
farther
we
go
for
instance
the
sum
of
the
first
six
terms
of
the
geometrical
progression
is
whereas
the
sum
of
the
first
six
terms
of
the
arithmetical
progression
is
only
the
difference
between
the
two
sums
being
the
sum
of
terms
is
for
the
and
for
the
the
difference
between
these
sums
of
only
terms
each
being
already
much
larger
than
before
if
now
we
take
the
sums
of
the
first
terms
they
will
be
and
having
a
difference
of
etc
consider
now
any
two
matters
of
great
importance
for
human
for
example
and
natural
any
other
two
major
concerns
of
humanity
it
is
as
plain
as
the
sun
that
if
progress
in
one
of
the
matters
advances
according
to
the
law
of
a
geometric
progression
and
the
other
in
accordance
with
a
law
of
an
arithmetical
progression
progress
in
the
former
matter
will
very
quickly
and
ever
more
and
more
rapidly
outstrip
progress
in
the
latter
so
that
if
the
two
interests
involved
be
interdependent
as
they
always
are
a
strain
is
gradually
produced
in
human
affairs
social
equilibrium
is
at
length
destroyed
there
follows
a
period
of
readjustment
by
means
of
violence
and
force
it
must
not
be
fancied
that
the
case
supposed
is
merely
hypothetical
the
whole
history
of
mankind
and
especially
the
present
condition
of
the
world
unite
in
showing
that
far
from
being
merely
hypothetical
the
case
supposed
has
always
been
actual
and
is
actual
on
a
vaster
scale
than
ever
before
my
contention
is
that
while
progress
in
some
of
the
great
matters
of
human
concern
has
been
long
proceeding
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
a
rapidly
increasing
geometric
progression
progress
in
the
other
matters
of
no
less
importance
has
advanced
only
at
the
rate
of
an
arithmetical
progression
or
at
best
at
the
rate
of
some
geometric
progression
of
relatively
slow
growth
to
see
it
and
to
understand
it
we
have
to
pay
the
small
price
of
a
little
observation
and
a
little
meditation
some
technological
invention
is
made
like
that
of
a
steam
engine
or
a
printing
press
for
example
or
some
discovery
of
scientific
method
like
that
of
analytical
geometry
or
the
infinitesimal
calculus
or
some
discovery
of
natural
law
like
that
of
falling
bodies
or
the
newtonian
law
of
gravitation
what
happens
what
is
the
effect
upon
the
progress
of
knowledge
and
invention
the
effect
is
stimulation
each
invention
leads
to
new
inventions
and
each
discovery
to
new
discoveries
invention
breeds
invention
science
begets
science
the
children
of
knowledge
produce
their
kind
in
larger
and
larger
families
the
process
goes
on
from
decade
to
decade
from
generation
to
generation
and
the
spectacle
we
behold
is
that
of
advancement
in
scientific
knowledge
and
technological
power
according
to
the
law
and
rate
of
a
rapidly
increasing
geometric
progression
or
logarithmic
function
and
now
what
must
we
say
of
the
pseudo
ethics
and
jurisprudence
and
economics
and
politics
and
government
for
the
answer
we
have
only
to
open
our
eyes
and
behold
the
world
by
virtue
of
the
advancement
that
has
long
been
going
on
with
ever
accelerated
logarithmic
rapidity
in
invention
in
mathematics
in
physics
in
chemistry
in
biology
in
astronomy
and
in
applications
of
them
time
and
space
and
matter
have
been
already
conquered
to
such
an
extent
that
our
globe
once
so
seemingly
vast
has
virtually
shrunken
to
the
dimensions
of
an
ancient
province
and
manifold
peoples
of
divers
tongues
and
traditions
and
customs
and
institutions
are
now
constrained
to
live
together
as
in
a
single
community
there
is
thus
demanded
a
new
ethical
wisdom
a
new
legal
wisdom
a
new
economical
wisdom
a
new
political
wisdom
a
new
wisdom
in
the
affairs
of
government
for
the
new
visions
our
anguished
times
cry
aloud
but
the
only
answers
are
reverberated
echoes
of
the
wailing
cry
mingled
with
the
chattering
voices
of
excited
public
men
who
know
not
what
to
do
why
what
is
the
explanation
the
question
is
double
why
the
disease
and
why
no
remedy
at
hand
the
answer
is
the
same
for
both
and
the
answer
is
that
the
sciences
of
ethics
and
jurisprudence
and
economics
and
politics
and
government
have
not
kept
pace
with
the
rapid
progress
made
in
the
other
great
affairs
of
man
they
have
lagged
behind
it
is
because
of
their
lagging
that
the
world
has
come
to
be
in
so
great
distress
and
it
is
because
of
their
lagging
that
they
have
not
now
the
needed
wisdom
to
effect
a
cure
do
you
ask
why
it
is
that
the
social
sciences
of
ethics
lagged
behind
the
answer
is
not
far
to
seek
nor
difficult
to
understand
they
have
lagged
behind
partly
because
they
have
been
hampered
by
the
traditions
and
the
habits
of
a
bygone
have
looked
backward
instead
of
forward
they
have
lagged
behind
partly
because
they
have
depended
upon
the
barren
methods
of
verbalistic
have
been
metaphysical
instead
of
scientific
they
have
lagged
behind
partly
because
they
have
been
often
dominated
by
the
lusts
of
cunning
politicians
instead
of
being
led
by
the
wisdom
of
enlightened
statesmen
they
have
lagged
behind
partly
because
they
have
been
predominantly
concerned
to
protect
vested
interests
upon
which
they
have
in
the
main
depended
for
support
the
cause
however
of
their
lagging
behind
is
found
in
the
astonishing
fact
that
despite
their
being
by
their
very
nature
most
concerned
with
the
affairs
of
mankind
they
have
not
discovered
what
man
really
is
but
have
from
time
immemorial
falsely
regarded
human
beings
either
as
animals
or
else
as
combinations
of
animals
and
something
supernatural
with
these
two
monstrous
conceptions
of
the
essential
nature
of
man
i
shall
deal
at
a
later
stage
of
this
writing
at
present
i
am
chiefly
concerned
to
drive
home
the
fact
that
it
is
the
great
between
the
rapid
progress
of
the
natural
and
technological
sciences
on
the
one
hand
and
the
slow
progress
of
the
metaphysical
social
sciences
on
the
other
hand
that
sooner
or
later
so
disturbs
the
equilibrium
of
human
affairs
as
to
result
periodically
in
those
social
cataclysms
which
we
call
insurrections
revolutions
and
wars
the
reader
should
note
carefully
that
such
cataclysmic
jumps
as
we
may
call
violent
readjustments
in
human
affairs
and
human
recorded
throughout
the
history
of
mankind
and
i
would
have
him
see
clearly
that
because
the
which
produces
them
increases
as
we
pass
from
generation
to
term
to
term
of
our
jumps
in
question
occur
not
only
with
increasing
violence
but
with
increasing
frequency
this
highly
significant
fact
may
be
graphically
illustrated
in
the
following
figure
a
horizontal
line
with
numbers
above
and
markings
in
the
corresponding
locations
below
geometric
evolution
of
the
natural
and
technological
progress
a
horizontal
line
again
marked
with

but
with

while
the

are
labeled
jump
revolution
or
arithmetical
evolution
of
the
social
sciences
accelerated
by
violent
social
progress
represent
the
geometrical
law
of
progression
in
the
natural
and
technological
sciences
peaceful
evolution
represent
the
lagging
arithmetical
law
of
progression
in
the
social
sciences
peaceful
evolution
both
of
these
during
the
same
periods
of
time
represent
revolutions
or
wars
with
the
aftermath
of
revolution
of
jump
readjustment
of
ideas
to
by
events
and
take
the
same
amount
of
time
but
the
second
progression
being
much
slower
than
the
first
one
the
jumps
or
revolutions
occur
at
shorter
intervals
as
time
goes
on
and
thus
more
frequently
force
us
to
coordinate
our
ideas
to
facts
periods
of
peace
or
seeming
peace
alternate
more
and
more
frequently
with
periods
of
violence
the
mentioned
of
progress
in
peaceful
times
is
the
hatching
seed
of
future
violence
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
few
mathematical
considerations
can
hardly
be
called
mathematics
or
mathematical
philosophy
nevertheless
without
bringing
attention
to
these
very
simple
mathematical
ideas
we
should
not
be
able
to
proceed
any
further
than
in
the
past
our
life
problems
have
always
been
solved
by
verbalists
and
rhetorical
metaphysicians
who
cleverly
played
with
vague
words
and
who
always
ignored
the
supremely
important
matter
of
dimensions
because
they
were
ignorant
of
it
there
was
no
possible
way
to
arrive
at
an
agreement
on
the
significance
of
words
or
even
the
understanding
of
them
let
us
take
for
instance
such
words
as
good
or
bad
or
truth
volumes
upon
volumes
have
been
written
about
them
no
one
has
reached
any
result
universally
acceptable
the
effect
has
been
to
multiply
warring
schools
of
and
partisans
in
the
meantime
corresponding
to
each
of
the
terms
good
bad
truth
exists
as
matter
of
fact
but
what
that
something
is
still
awaits
scientific
determination
if
only
these
three
words
could
be
scientifically
defined
philosophy
law
ethics
and
psychology
would
cease
to
be
private
theories
or
verbalism
and
they
would
advance
to
the
rank
and
dignity
of
sciences
here
i
may
quote
a
characteristic
of
life
as
expressed
by
one
of
the
heroes
of
my
esteemed
friend
harvey
o
higgins
in
his
book
the
life
imaginary
portraits
of
some
distinguished
harper
n
warren
never
philosophized
he
handled
facts
as
an
artisan
handles
his
tools
but
if
he
philosophized
his
theory
of
life
would
probably
have
been
something
like
this
there
is
no
justice
there
is
no
morality
in
nature
or
in
natural
laws
justice
and
morality
are
laws
only
of
human
society
but
society
natural
life
and
all
civilization
are
subject
in
their
larger
aspects
to
natural
contradict
morality
and
outrage
the
statesman
has
to
move
with
those
laws
and
direct
his
people
in
accordance
with
them
despite
the
lesser
of
morality
and
if
such
are
the
creeds
of
distinguished
people
anywhere
what
better
can
we
expect
than
that
which
we
see
in
the
history
of
humanity
but
the
fact
that
the
old
philosophy
law
ethics
psychology
politics
and
sociology
could
not
solve
the
practical
problems
of
humanity
is
not
any
reason
whatsoever
why
we
should
despair
the
problems
can
be
solved
to
follow
the
reasoning
of
this
book
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
a
highly
trained
specialist
the
only
qualifications
required
are
candor
an
open
mind
freedom
from
blinding
prejudice
thoughtfulness
a
real
desire
for
truth
and
enough
common
sense
to
understand
that
to
talk
of
adding
three
quarts
of
milk
to
of
a
mile
is
to
talk
nonsense
chapter
ii
childhood
of
humanity
the
conclusion
of
the
world
war
is
the
closing
of
the
period
of
the
childhood
of
humanity
this
childhood
as
any
childhood
can
be
characterized
as
devoid
of
any
real
understanding
of
values
as
is
that
of
a
child
who
uses
a
priceless
chronometer
to
crack
nuts
this
childhood
has
been
unduly
long
but
happily
we
are
near
to
the
end
of
it
for
humanity
shaken
by
this
war
is
coming
to
its
senses
and
must
soon
enter
its
manhood
a
period
of
great
achievements
and
rewards
in
the
new
and
real
sense
of
values
dawning
upon
us
the
sacred
dead
will
not
have
died
for
naught
the
red
wine
of
youth
the
wanton
waste
of
life
has
shown
us
the
price
of
life
and
we
will
have
to
keep
our
oath
to
make
the
future
worthy
of
their
sweat
and
blood
early
ideas
are
not
necessarily
true
ideas
there
are
different
kinds
of
interpretations
of
history
and
different
schools
of
philosophy
all
of
them
have
contributed
something
to
human
progress
but
none
of
them
has
been
able
to
give
the
world
a
basic
philosophy
embracing
the
whole
progress
of
science
and
establishing
the
life
of
man
upon
the
abiding
foundation
of
fact
our
life
is
bound
to
develop
according
to
evident
or
else
concealed
laws
of
nature
the
evident
laws
of
nature
were
the
inspiration
of
genuine
science
in
its
cradle
and
their
interpretations
or
misinterpretations
have
from
the
earliest
times
formed
systems
of
law
of
ethics
and
of
philosophy
human
intellect
be
it
that
of
an
individual
or
that
of
the
race
forms
conclusions
which
have
to
be
often
revised
before
they
correspond
approximately
to
facts
what
we
call
progress
consists
in
coordinating
ideas
with
realities
the
world
war
has
taught
something
to
everybody
it
was
indeed
a
great
reality
it
accustomed
us
to
think
in
terms
of
reality
and
not
in
those
of
phantom
speculation
some
unmistakable
truths
were
revealed
facts
and
force
were
the
things
that
counted
power
had
to
be
produced
to
destroy
hostile
power
it
was
found
that
the
old
political
and
economic
systems
were
not
adequate
to
the
task
put
upon
them
the
world
had
to
create
new
economic
conditions
it
was
obliged
to
supplement
the
old
systems
with
special
boards
for
food
coal
railroads
shipping
labor
etc
the
world
war
emergency
compelled
the
nations
to
organize
for
producing
greater
power
in
order
to
conquer
power
already
great
if
there
is
anything
which
this
war
has
proved
it
is
the
fact
that
the
most
important
asset
a
nation
or
an
individual
can
have
is
the
ability
to
do
in
flanders
fields
the
poppies
blow
that
is
too
true
they
blow
and
they
are
strong
and
red
but
the
purpose
of
this
writing
is
not
the
celebration
of
poetry
but
the
elucidation
and
right
use
of
facts
normally
thousands
of
rabbits
and
guinea
pigs
are
used
and
killed
in
scientific
laboratories
for
experiments
which
yield
great
and
tangible
benefits
to
humanity
this
war
butchered
millions
of
people
and
ruined
the
health
and
lives
of
tens
of
millions
is
this
climax
of
the
civilization
to
be
passed
unnoticed
except
for
the
poetry
and
the
manuring
of
the
battle
fields
that
the
poppies
blow
stronger
and
better
fed
or
is
the
death
of
ten
men
on
the
battle
field
to
be
of
as
much
worth
in
knowledge
gained
as
is
the
life
of
one
rabbit
killed
for
experiment
is
the
great
sacrifice
worth
analysing
there
can
be
only
one
but
if
truth
be
desired
the
analysis
must
be
scientific
in
science
opinions
are
tolerated
when
and
only
when
facts
are
lacking
in
this
case
we
have
all
the
facts
necessary
we
have
only
to
collect
them
and
analyse
them
rejecting
mere
opinions
as
cheap
and
unworthy
such
as
understand
this
lesson
will
know
how
to
act
for
the
benefit
of
all
at
present
the
future
of
mankind
is
dark
stop

prudent
caution

railroad
be
amended
to
read
stop
look
listen
and
think
not
for
the
saving
of
a
few
lives
in
railroad
accidents
but
for
the
preservation
of
the
life
of
humanity
living
organisms
of
the
lower
and
simpler
types
in
which
the
differentiation
and
the
integration
of
the
vital
organs
have
not
been
carried
far
can
move
about
for
a
considerable
time
after
being
deprived
of
the
appliances
by
which
the
life
force
is
accumulated
and
transferred
but
higher
organisms
are
instantly
killed
by
the
removal
of
such
appliances
or
even
by
the
injury
of
minor
parts
of
them
even
more
easily
destroyed
are
the
more
advanced
and
complicated
organizations
the
first
question
is
what
are
to
be
the
scientific
methods
that
will
eliminate
diverse
opinions
and
creeds
from
an
analysis
of
facts
and
ensure
correct
deductions
based
upon
them
a
short
survey
of
facts
concerning
civilization
will
help
to
point
the
way
humanity
in
its
cradle
did
not
have
science
it
had
only
the
faculties
of
observation
and
speculation
in
the
early
days
there
was
much
speculative
thinking
but
it
was
without
any
sufficient
basis
of
facts
theology
and
philosophy
flourished
their
speculations
were
often
very
clever
but
all
their
primitive
notions
about
as
the
structure
of
the
heavens
the
form
of
the
earth
mechanical
principles
meteorological
or
physiological
almost
all
of
them
wrong
what
is
history
what
is
its
significance
for
humanity
robinson
gives
us
a
precise
answer
man
s
abject
dependence
on
the
past
gives
rise
to
the
continuity
of
history
our
convictions
opinions
prejudices
intellectual
tastes
our
knowledge
our
methods
of
learning
and
of
applying
for
information
we
owe
with
slight
exceptions
to
the
to
the
remote
past
history
is
an
expansion
of
memory
and
like
memory
it
alone
can
explain
the
present
and
in
this
lies
its
most
unmistakable
the
savage
regards
every
striking
phenomenon
or
group
of
phenomena
as
caused
by
some
personal
agent
and
from
remotest
antiquity
the
mode
of
thinking
has
changed
only
as
fast
as
the
relations
among
phenomena
have
been
established
human
nature
was
always
asking
why
and
not
being
able
to
answer
why
they
found
their
answer
through
another
factor
the
unknown
was
called
gods
or
god
but
with
the
progress
of
science
the
why
became
more
and
more
evident
and
the
question
came
to
be
from
the
early
days
of
humanity
dogmatic
theology
law
ethics
and
science
in
its
infancy
were
the
monopolies
of
one
class
and
the
source
of
their
power
the
first
to
break
this
power
were
the
exact
sciences
they
progressed
too
rapidly
to
be
bound
and
limited
by
obscure
old
writings
and
prejudices
life
and
realities
were
their
domain
science
brushed
aside
all
sophistry
and
became
a
reality
ethics
is
too
fundamentally
important
a
factor
in
civilization
to
depend
upon
a
theological
or
a
legal
excuse
ethics
must
conform
to
the
laws
of
human
laws
legal
ideas
date
from
the
beginning
of
civilization
legal
speculation
was
wonderfully
developed
in
parallel
lines
with
theology
and
philosophy
before
the
natural
and
exact
sciences
came
into
existence
law
was
always
made
by
the
few
and
in
general
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
the
existing
order
or
for
the
reestablishment
of
the
old
order
and
the
punishment
of
the
offenders
against
it
dogmatic
theology
is
by
its
very
nature
unchangeable
the
same
can
be
said
in
regard
to
the
spirit
of
the
law
law
was
and
is
to
protect
the
past
and
present
status
of
society
and
by
its
very
essence
must
be
very
conservative
if
not
reactionary
theology
and
law
are
both
of
them
static
by
their
nature
philosophy
law
and
ethics
to
be
effective
in
a
dynamic
world
must
be
dynamic
they
must
be
made
vital
enough
to
keep
pace
with
the
progress
of
life
and
science
in
recent
civilization
ethics
because
controlled
by
theology
and
law
which
are
static
could
not
duly
influence
the
dynamic
revolutionary
progress
of
technic
and
the
steadily
changing
conditions
of
life
and
so
we
witness
a
tremendous
downfall
of
morals
in
politics
and
business
life
progresses
faster
than
our
ideas
and
so
medieval
ideas
methods
and
judgments
are
constantly
applied
to
the
conditions
and
problems
of
modern
life
this
discrepancy
between
facts
and
ideas
is
greatly
responsible
for
the
dividing
of
modern
society
into
different
warring
classes
which
do
not
understand
each
other
medieval
legalism
and
medieval
basis
of
the
old
by
their
nature
conservative
reactionary
opposed
to
change
and
thus
becoming
more
and
more
unable
to
support
the
mighty
social
burden
of
the
modern
world
must
be
adjudged
responsible
in
a
large
measure
for
the
circumstances
which
made
the
world
war
inevitable
under
the
flash
of
explosives
some
of
the
workings
of
those
antiquated
ideas
were
exposed
or
crushed
the
world
war
has
profoundly
changed
economic
conditions
and
made
it
necessary
to
erect
new
standards
of
values
we
are
forced
to
realize
that
evolution
by
transformation
is
a
cosmic
process
and
that
reaction
though
it
may
retard
it
can
not
entirely
stop
it
the
idea
that
organic
species
are
results
of
special
creation
has
no
scientific
standard
whatever
there
is
not
one
fact
tending
to
prove
special
or
separate
creation
the
evidence
which
is
overwhelming
is
all
of
it
on
the
other
side
the
hypothesis
of
special
creation
is
a
mere
fossil
of
the
past
evolution
is
the
only
theory
which
is
in
harmony
with
facts
and
with
all
branches
of
science
life
is
dynamic
not
static
philosophy
as
defined
by
fichte
is
the
science
of
its
aim
was
to
solve
the
problems
of
the
world
in
the
past
when
all
exact
sciences
were
in
their
infancy
philosophy
had
to
be
purely
speculative
with
little
or
no
regard
to
realities
but
if
we
regard
philosophy
as
a
mother
science
divided
into
many
branches
we
find
that
those
branches
have
grown
so
large
and
various
that
the
mother
science
looks
like
a
hen
with
her
little
ducklings
paddling
in
a
pond
far
beyond
her
reach
she
is
unable
to
follow
her
growing
hatchlings
in
the
meantime
the
progress
of
life
and
science
goes
on
irrespective
of
the
cackling
of
metaphysics
philosophy
does
not
fulfill
her
initial
aim
to
bring
the
results
of
experimental
and
exact
sciences
together
and
to
solve
world
problems
through
endless
scientific
specialization
scientific
branches
multiply
and
for
want
of
coordination
the
great
suffer
this
failure
of
philosophy
to
fulfill
her
boasted
mission
of
scientific
coordination
is
responsible
for
the
chaos
in
the
world
of
general
thought
the
world
has
no
collective
or
organized
higher
ideals
and
aims
nor
even
fixed
general
purposes
life
is
an
accidental
game
of
private
or
collective
ambitions
and
greeds
systematic
study
of
chemical
and
physical
phenomena
has
been
carried
on
for
many
generations
and
these
two
sciences
now
include
knowledge
of
an
enormous
number
of
facts
a
large
body
of
natural
laws
many
fertile
working
hypotheses
respecting
the
causes
and
regularities
of
natural
phenomena
and
finally
many
helpful
theories
held
subject
to
correction
by
further
testing
of
the
hypotheses
giving
rise
to
them
when
a
subject
is
spoken
of
as
a
science
it
is
understood
to
include
all
of
the
above
mentioned
parts
facts
alone
do
not
constitute
a
science
any
more
than
a
pile
of
stones
constitutes
a
house
not
even
do
facts
and
laws
alone
there
must
be
facts
hypotheses
theories
and
laws
before
the
subject
is
entitled
to
the
rank
of
a
science
the
primal
function
of
a
science
is
to
enable
us
to
anticipate
the
future
in
the
field
to
which
it
relates
judged
by
this
standard
neither
philosophy
nor
its
social
in
the
past
been
very
effective
there
was
for
example
no
official
warning
of
the
coming
of
the
world
greatest
of
catastrophes
the
future
was
not
anticipated
because
political
philosophers
did
not
possess
the
necessary
basis
of
knowledge
to
be
just
we
must
admit
that
philosophy
has
been
but
little
aided
financially
because
it
is
commonly
regarded
as
unnecessary
the
technical
branches
of
science
have
been
strongly
backed
and
generally
supported
by
those
to
whom
they
have
brought
direct
profit
and
so
they
have
had
better
opportunities
for
development
ethics
in
the
stifling
grip
of
myth
and
legalism
is
not
convincing
enough
to
exercise
controlling
influence
such
is
the
situation
in
which
we
find
ourselves
being
still
in
our
childhood
and
thinking
like
savages
we
looked
upon
the
world
war
as
a
personal
creation
of
a
because
those
interested
in
it
told
us
so
we
neglected
to
use
our
common
sense
and
look
deeper
into
its
origins
to
perform
for
ourselves
the
duty
which
political
philosophy
did
not
perform
for
duty
of
thinking
in
terms
of
facts
and
not
in
terms
of
metaphysical
speculations
knowledge
of
facts
would
have
told
us
that
the
war
lords
were
only
the
representatives
of
the
ruling
classes
a
system
of
social
and
economic
order
built
exclusively
on
selfishness
greed
survival
of
the
fittest
and
ruthless
competition
must
cease
to
exist
or
exist
by
means
of
war
the
representatives
of
this
system
determined
to
continue
to
exist
and
so
war
was
the
consequence
the
ruling
classes
carried
the
whole
system
under
which
they
lived
to
its
logical
conclusion
and
natural
issue
which
is
grab
what
you
this
motto
is
not
peculiar
to
any
one
country
it
is
the
motto
of
our
whole
civilization
and
is
the
inevitable
outcome
of
our
stupid
philosophy
regarding
the
characteristic
nature
of
man
and
the
proper
potentialities
of
human
life
where
are
we
to
find
the
true
doctrines
where
the
true
philosophy
if
we
go
back
over
the
history
of
civilization
we
find
that
in
all
sciences
except
the
exact
ones
private
opinions
and
theories
have
shaped
our
beliefs
colored
our
mental
processes
and
controlled
our
destinies
we
see
for
example
pessimism
opposed
to
optimism
materialism
to
spiritualism
realism
to
idealism
capitalism
to
socialism
and
so
on
endlessly
each
of
the
disputatious
systems
has
a
large
number
of
followers
and
each
faction
looks
upon
the
others
as
deprived
of
truth
common
sense
and
knowledge
all
of
them
play
with
the
words
natural
law
which
they
ignorantly
presume
to
have
as
the
basis
and
content
of
their
own
particular
doctrine
it
is
the
same
in
the
realm
of
religions
there
are
approximately
million
confucianists
or
taoists
million
roman
catholics
million
mohammedans
million
hindus
million
protestants
million
animists
million
buddhists
million
orthodox
speak
only
of
the
most
important
religions
each
group
and
they
are
rather
large
groups
believes
its
theory
or
its
faith
to
be
infallible
and
all
the
others
to
be
false
bacon
seems
a
bit
remote
but
the
idols
and
medieval
fetishes
which
he
so
masterfully
describes
are
equally
venerated
by
francis
bacon
four
species
of
idols
beset
the
human
mind
to
which
for
distinction
s
sake
we
have
assigned
names
calling
the
first
idols
of
the
tribe
the
second
idols
of
the
den
the
third
idols
of
the
market
the
fourth
idols
of
the
theatre
the
information
of
notions
and
axioms
on
the
foundation
of
true
induction
is
the
only
fitting
remedy
by
which
we
can
ward
off
and
expel
these
idols
it
is
however
of
great
service
to
point
them
out
for
the
doctrine
of
idols
bears
the
same
relation
to
the
interpretation
of
nature
as
that
of
the
confutation
of
sophisms
does
to
common
logic
the
idols
of
the
tribe
are
inherent
in
human
nature
and
the
very
tribe
or
race
of
man
for
man
s
sense
is
falsely
asserted
to
be
the
standard
of
things
on
the
contrary
all
the
perceptions
both
of
the
senses
and
the
mind
bear
reference
to
man
and
not
to
the
universe
and
the
human
mind
resembles
these
uneven
mirrors
which
impart
their
own
properties
to
different
objects
from
which
rays
are
emitted
and
distort
and
disfigure
them
the
idols
of
the
den
are
those
of
each
individual
for
everybody
in
addition
to
the
errors
common
to
the
race
of
man
has
his
own
individual
den
or
cavern
which
intercepts
and
corrupts
the
light
of
nature
either
from
his
own
peculiar
and
singular
disposition
or
from
his
education
and
intercourse
with
others
or
from
his
reading
and
the
authority
acquired
by
those
whom
he
reverences
and
admires
or
from
the
different
impressions
produced
on
the
mind
as
it
happens
to
be
preoccupied
and
predisposed
or
equable
and
tranquil
and
the
like
so
that
the
spirit
of
man
according
to
its
several
dispositions
is
variable
confused
and
as
it
were
actuated
by
chance
and
heraclitus
said
well
that
men
search
for
knowledge
in
lesser
worlds
and
not
in
the
greater
or
common
world
there
are
also
idols
formed
by
the
reciprocal
intercourse
and
society
of
man
with
man
which
we
call
idols
of
the
market
from
the
commerce
and
association
of
men
with
each
other
for
men
converse
by
means
of
language
but
words
are
formed
at
the
will
of
the
generality
and
there
arises
from
a
bad
and
unapt
formation
of
words
a
wonderful
obstruction
to
the
mind
nor
can
the
definitions
and
explanations
with
which
learned
men
are
wont
to
guard
and
protect
themselves
in
some
instances
afford
a
complete
still
manifestly
force
the
understanding
throw
everything
into
confusion
and
lead
mankind
into
vain
and
innumerable
controversies
and
fallacies
lastly
there
are
idols
which
have
crept
into
men
s
minds
from
the
various
dogmas
of
peculiar
systems
of
philosophy
and
also
from
the
perverted
rules
of
demonstration
and
these
we
denominate
idols
of
the
theatre
for
we
regard
all
the
systems
of
philosophy
hitherto
received
or
imagined
as
so
many
plays
brought
out
and
performed
creating
fictitious
and
theatrical
worlds
nor
do
we
speak
only
of
the
present
systems
or
of
the
philosophy
and
sects
of
the
ancients
since
numerous
other
plays
of
a
similar
nature
can
be
still
composed
and
made
to
agree
with
each
other
the
causes
of
the
most
opposite
errors
being
generally
the
same
nor
again
do
we
allude
merely
to
general
systems
but
also
to
many
elements
and
axioms
of
sciences
which
have
become
inveterate
by
tradition
implicit
credence
and
metaphysical
speculation
and
its
swarming
progeny
of
blind
and
selfish
political
philosophies
private
opinions
private
truths
and
private
doctrines
sectarian
opinions
sectarian
truths
and
sectarian
doctrines
querulous
confused
and
is
characteristic
of
the
of
humanity
the
period
of
humanity
s
will
i
doubt
not
be
a
scientific
period
that
will
witness
the
gradual
extension
of
scientific
method
to
all
the
interests

in
which
man
will
discover

chapter

classes
of
life
the
problems
to
be
dealt
with
in
this
chapter
are
not
easy
but
they
are
exceedingly
important
to
classify
phenomena
correctly
they
must
be
correctly
analysed
and
clearly
defined
for
the
sake
of
clearness
i
will
use
the
simplest
illustrations
and
avoiding
as
much
as
possible
the
difficulties
of
technical
terms
will
use
language
easily
to
be
understood
by
every
one
in
some
cases
the
words
will
indeed
have
a
technical
meaning
and
it
will
be
necessary
to
exercise
great
care
against
the
danger
of
giving
false
impressions
for
clear
ideas
are
essential
to
sound
thinking
as
a
matter
of
fact
our
common
daily
speech
is
ill
adapted
for
the
precise
expression
of
thought
even
scientific
language
is
often
too
vague
for
the
purpose
and
requires
further
refining
some
may
say
that
it
is
useless
and
unnecessary
to
lay
so
much
stress
on
correct
thinking
and
precise
expression
that
it
has
no
practical
value
for
they
say
that
business
language
is
good
enough
to
talk
business
or
to
put
something
over
the
other
fellow
but
a
little
explanation
will
show
that
precision
is
often
of
the
greatest
importance
humanity
is
a
peculiar
class
of
life
which
in
some
degree
determines
its
own
destinies
therefore
in
practical
life
and
become
moreover
which
bring
about
important
practical
consequences
for
instance
many
millions
of
human
beings
have
defined
a
stroke
of
lightning
as
being
the
punishment
of
god
of
evil
men
other
millions
have
defined
it
as
a
natural
casual
periodical
phenomenon
yet
other
millions
have
defined
it
as
an
electric
what
has
been
the
result
of
these
definitions
in
practical
life
in
the
case
of
the
first
definition
when
lightning
struck
a
house
the
population
naturally
made
no
attempt
to
save
the
house
or
anything
in
it
because
to
do
so
would
be
against
the
definition
which
proclaims
the
phenomenon
to
be
a
punishment
for
evil
any
attempt
to
prevent
or
check
the
destruction
would
be
an
impious
act
the
sinner
would
be
guilty
of
resisting
the
supreme
law
and
would
deserve
to
be
punished
by
death
now
in
the
second
instance
a
stricken
building
is
treated
just
as
any
tree
overturned
by
storm
the
people
save
what
they
can
and
try
to
extinguish
the
fire
in
both
instances
the
behavior
of
the
populace
is
the
same
in
one
respect
if
caught
in
the
open
by
a
storm
they
take
refuge
under
a
means
of
safety
involving
maximum
danger
but
the
people
do
not
know
it
now
in
the
third
instance
in
which
the
population
have
a
scientifically
correct
definition
of
lightning
they
provide
their
houses
with
lightning
rods
and
if
they
are
caught
by
a
storm
in
the
open
they
neither
run
nor
hide
under
a
tree
but
when
the
storm
is
directly
over
their
heads
they
put
themselves
in
a
position
of
minimum
exposure
by
lying
flat
on
the
ground
until
the
storm
has
passed
such
examples
could
be
given
without
end
but
there
is
another
example
of
sufficient
vital
importance
to
be
given
here
as
it
has
to
do
with
our
conception
of
the
social
and
economic
system
and
the
state
if
our
institutions
are
considered
and
therefore
reformer
or
advocate
of
change
should
be
treated
as
a
criminal
or
a
danger
to
the
existing
order
and
hanged
or
at
least
put
in
jail
for
life
but
now
if
our
institutions
are
man
made
imperfect
and
often
foolish
and
subject
to
change
all
the
time
steadily
and
dynamically
in
obedience
to
some
known
or
unknown
law
then
of
course
all
reactionaries
would
be
a
danger
to
the
natural
order
and
they
should
be
treated
the
same
way
the
importance
of
definitions
can
be
seen
in
all
other
fields
of
practical
life
definitions
create
conditions
to
know
the
world
in
which
we
live
we
have
to
analyse
facts
by
help
of
such
facts
as
we
know
in
daily
practice
and
such
facts
as
are
established
in
scientific
laboratories
where
men
do
not
jump
to
conclusions
in
some
places
it
will
be
necessary
to
make
statements
that
will
have
to
await
full
justification
at
a
later
stage
of
the
discussion
this
will
be
necessary
to
indicate
the
trend
of
the
analysis
the
aim
of
the
analysis
is
to
give
us
just
conceptions
correct
definitions
and
true
propositions
the
process
is
slow
progressive
and
endless
the
problems
are
infinitely
many
and
it
is
necessary
to
select
fortunately
the
solution
of
a
few
leads
automatically
to
the
solution
of
many
others
some
of
the
greatest
and
most
scientific
discoveries
have
been
nothing
else
than
a
few
correct
definitions
a
few
just
concepts
and
a
few
true
propositions
such
for
example
was
the
work
of
euclid
newton
and
few
correct
definitions
a
few
just
concepts
a
few
true
propositions
but
these
have
been
extended
and
multiplied
sometimes
by
men
of
creative
genius
and
often
almost
automatically
by
men
of
merely
good
sense
and
fair
talent
the
matter
of
definition
i
have
said
is
very
important
i
am
not
now
speaking
of
definitions
which
for
convenience
merely
give
names
to
known
objects
i
am
speaking
of
such
definitions
of
phenomena
as
result
from
correct
analysis
of
the
phenomena
nominal
definitions
are
mere
conveniences
and
are
neither
true
nor
false
but
analytic
definitions
are
definitive
and
are
true
or
else
false
let
us
dwell
upon
the
matter
a
little
more
in
the
illustration
of
the
definitions
of
lightning
there
were
three
the
first
was
the
most
mistaken
and
its
application
brought
the
most
harm
the
second
was
less
incorrect
and
the
practical
results
less
bad
the
third
under
the
present
conditions
of
our
knowledge
was
the
true
one
and
it
brought
the
maximum
benefit
this
lightning
illustration
suggests
the
important
idea
of
truth
and
idea
that
is
of
degrees
of
truth
and
degrees
of
falsehood
a
definition
may
be
neither
absolutely
true
nor
absolutely
false
but
of
two
definitions
of
the
same
thing
one
of
them
may
be
truer
or
falser
than
the
other
if
for
illustration
s
sake
we
call
the
first
truth
alpha
the
second
one
alpha
the
third
one
alpha
we
may
suppose
that
a
genius
appears
who
has
the
faculty
to
surpass
all
the
other
relative
truths
and
gives
us
an
absolute
or
final
truth
valid
in
infinity
say
a
final
definition
that
lightning
is
so
and
so
a
kind
of
energy
which
flows
let
us
say
through
a
glass
tube
filled
with
charcoal
then
of
course
this
definition
would
immediately
make
obvious
what
use
could
be
made
of
it
we
could
erect
glass
towers
filled
with
charcoal
and
so
secure
an
unlimited
flow
of
available
free
energy
and
our
whole
life
would
be
affected
in
an
untold
degree
this
example
explains
the
importance
of
correct
definitions
but
to
take
another
example
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
phenomenon
called
the
color
red
imagine
how
it
might
be
defined
a
reactionary
would
call
it
a
bolshevik
a
bolshevik
would
say
my
color
a
person
would
say
such
a
thing
does
not
exist
a
daltonist
would
say
that
is
green
a
metaphysician
would
say
that
is
the
soul
of
whiskey
an
historian
would
say
that
is
the
color
of
the
ink
with
which
human
history
has
been
written
an
uneducated
person
would
say
that
is
the
color
of
blood
the
modern
scientist
would
say
it
is
the
light
of
such
and
such
wave
length
if
this
last
definition
be
valid
in
infinity
or
not
we
do
not
know
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
scientific
truth
in
the
present
condition
of
our
knowledge
this
final
but
unknown
truth
valid
in
infinity
is
somehow
perceived
or
felt
by
us
as
an
ideal
for
in
countless
years
of
observation
we
have
formed
a
series
of
less
and
less
false
more
and
more
nearly
true
ideas
about
the
phenomenon
the
ideas
are
of
the
phenomenon
reflected
in
our
midst
as
in
a
mirror
the
reflexes
may
be
distorted
as
in
a
convex
or
concave
mirror
but
they
suggest
an
ideal
reflex
valid
in
infinity
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
realize
that
the
words
which
are
used
to
express
the
ideas
and
the
ideals
are
the
materialization
of
the
ideas
and
ideal
it
is
only
by
words
that
we
are
enabled
to
give
to
other
human
beings
an
exact
or
nearly
exact
impression
which
we
have
had
of
the
phenomenon
it
may
be
helpful
to
illustrate
this
process
by
an
example
let
us
suppose
that
a
man
makes
an
experiment
of
doing
his
own
portrait
from
a
mirror
which
may
be
plane
concave
or
convex
if
he
looks
into
a
plane
mirror
he
will
see
his
true
likeness
even
so
if
he
be
a
poor
designer
he
will
draw
the
likeness
badly
let
us
suppose
that
the
man
has
beautiful
features
but
because
the
drawing
is
very
poor
it
will
not
convey
the
impression
that
the
features
of
the
original
were
beautiful
if
this
poor
designer
were
to
look
into
and
work
from
a
concave
or
convex
mirror
the
drawing
of
his
likeness
would
have
practically
no
resemblance
to
his
original
features
for
correct
analysis
and
true
definitions
of
the
cardinal
classes
of
life
in
our
world
it
is
necessary
to
have
some
just
ideas
about
dimensions
or
dimensionality
the
britannica
gives
us
some
help
in
this
connection
i
will
explain
briefly
by
an
example
measurable
entities
of
different
kinds
can
not
be
compared
directly
each
one
must
be
measured
in
terms
of
a
unit
of
its
own
kind
a
line
can
have
only
length
and
therefore
is
of
one
dimension
a
surface
has
length
and
width
and
is
therefore
said
to
have
two
dimensions
a
volume
has
length
width
and
thickness
and
is
therefore
said
to
have
three
dimensions
if
we
take
for
example
a
a
see
that
the
cube
has
surfaces
and
lines
and
points
but
a
volume
is
not
a
surface
nor
a
line
nor
a
point
just
these
dimensional
differences
have
an
enormous
unrealized
importance
in
practical
life
as
in
the
case
of
taking
a
line
of
five
units
of
length
and
building
upon
it
a
square
the
measure
of
this
square
surface
will
not
be
it
will
be
and
the
will
not
be
linear
units
but
square
or
surface
units
if
upon
this
square
we
build
a
cube
this
cube
will
have
neither
nor
for
its
measure
it
will
have
and
this
number
will
not
be
so
many
units
of
length
nor
of
surface
but
so
many
solid
or
cubic
units
it
is
as
plain
as
a
pike
staff
that
if
we
confused
when
computing
lengths
and
areas
and
volumes
we
would
wreck
all
the
architectural
and
engineering
structures
of
the
world
and
at
the
same
time
show
ourselves
stupider
than
to
analyse
the
classes
of
life
we
have
to
consider
two
very
different
kinds
of
phenomena
the
one
embraced
under
the
collective
other
under
the
collective
chemistry
or
the
chemistry
of
these
divisions
are
made
because
of
the
peculiar
properties
of
the
elements
chiefly
involved
in
the
second
class
the
properties
of
matter
are
so
distributed
among
the
elements
that
three
of
hydrogen
and
an
ensemble
of
unique
characteristics
the
number
of
reactions
in
inorganic
chemistry
are
relatively
few
but
in
organic
the
chemistry
of
these
three
elements
the
number
of
different
compounds
is
practically
unlimited
up
to
we
knew
of
more
than
elements
of
which
the
whole
number
of
reactions
amounted
to
only
a
few
hundreds
but
among
the
remaining
three
hydrogen
and
reactions
were
known
to
be
practically
unlimited
in
number
and
possibilities
this
fact
must
have
very
far
reaching
consequences
as
far
as
energies
are
concerned
we
have
to
take
them
as
nature
reveals
them
to
us
here
more
than
ever
mathematical
thinking
is
essential
and
will
help
enormously
the
reactions
in
inorganic
chemistry
always
involve
the
phenomenon
of
heat
sometimes
light
and
in
some
instances
an
unusual
energy
is
produced
called
electricity
until
now
the
radioactive
elements
represent
a
group
too
insufficiently
known
for
an
enlargement
here
upon
this
subject
the
organic
compounds
being
unlimited
in
number
and
possibilities
and
with
their
unique
characteristics
represent
of
course
a
different
class
of
phenomena
but
being
at
the
same
time
they
include
the
basic
chemical
phenomena
involved
in
all
chemical
reactions
but
being
unique
in
many
other
respects
they
also
have
an
infinitely
vast
field
of
unique
characteristics
among
the
energetic
phenomena
of
organic
chemistry
besides
the
few
mentioned
above
there
are
new
and
unique
energetic
phenomena
occurring
in
this
dimension
of
these
phenomena
mention
may
be
made
of
the
phenomenon
life
the
phenomenon
of
the
instincts
and
of
the
mind
in
general
these
energetic
phenomena
are
unique
for
the
unique
chemistry
of
the
three
unique
elements
it
is
obvious
that
this
uniqueness
is
the
reason
why
these
phenomena
must
be
classified
as
belonging
to
or
having
a
higher
dimensionality
than
belongs
to
the
phenomena
of
inorganic
chemistry
just
as
the
uniqueness
of
the
properties
of
a
volume
as
compared
with
surface
properties
depends
upon
the
fact
that
a
volume
has
a
higher
dimensionality
than
a
surface
just
as
this
difference
of
dimensions
makes
the
whole
difference
between
the
geometry
of
volumes
and
the
geometry
of
surfaces
the
difference
between
the
two
chemistries
involves
a
difference
of
dimensionality
the
higher
energies
of
the
chemistries
of
the
higher
dimensionality
are
very
difficult
to
define
my
descriptions
are
no
better
than
the
description
of
life
given
by
professor
wilhelm
roux
in
his
kampf
der
teile
im
leipzig
which
are
equally
unsatisfactory
in
want
of
a
better
i
quote
him
he
defines
a
living
being
as
a
natural
object
which
possesses
the
following
nine
characteristic
autonomous
activities
autonomous
change
autonomous
excretion
autonomous
ingestion
autonomous
assimilation
autonomous
growth
autonomous
movement
autonomous
multiplication
autonomous
transmission
of
hereditary
characteristics
and
autonomous
development
the
words
autonomous
activities
are
important
because
they
hint
at
the
dimensional
differences
of
these
energies
but
a
better
word
should
be
found
to
define
the
dimensional
differences
between
the
activities
found
in
inorganic
chemistry
and
those
found
in
organic
chemistry
we
see
it
is
a
mistake
to
speak
about
life
in
a
crystal
in
the
same
sense
in
which
we
use
the
word
life
to
name
the
curious
autonomous
phenomenon
of
organic
chemistry
which
is
of
another
dimension
than
the
activities
in
inorganic
chemistry
for
the
life
in
the
autonomous
or
anautonomous
activities
of
word
than
life
should
be
found
in
the
theory
of
crystals
the
term
life
is
purely
rhetorical
its
use
there
is
very
injurious
to
sound
science
these
old
ideas
of
life
in
crystals
are
profoundly
unscientific
and
serve
as
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
frequent
confusion
or
intermixing
of
confusion
due
to
unmathematical
logically
incorrect
ways
of
thinking
if
crystals
live
then
are
and
cubic
square
belonging
to
the
childhood
of
crystals
can
grow
in
a
proper
solution
and
can
regenerate
their
form
in
such
a
solution
when
broken
or
injured
it
is
even
possible
to
prevent
or
retard
the
formation
of
crystals
in
a
supersaturated
solution
by
preventing
germs
in
the
air
from
getting
into
the
solution
an
observation
which
was
later
utilized
by
schroeder
and
pasteur
in
their
experiments
on
spontaneous
generation
however
the
analogies
between
a
living
organism
and
a
crystal
are
merely
superficial
and
it
is
by
pointing
out
the
fundamental
differences
between
the
behavior
of
crystals
and
that
of
living
organisms
that
we
can
best
understand
the
specific
difference
between
and
living
matter
it
is
true
that
a
crystal
can
grow
but
it
will
do
so
only
in
a
supersaturated
solution
of
its
own
substance
just
the
reverse
is
true
for
living
organisms
in
order
to
make
bacteria
or
the
cells
of
our
body
grow
solutions
of
the
split
products
of
the
substances
composing
them
and
not
the
substances
themselves
must
be
available
to
the
cells
second
these
solutions
must
not
be
supersaturated
on
the
contrary
they
must
be
dilute
and
third
growth
leads
in
living
organisms
to
cell
division
as
soon
as
the
mass
of
the
cell
reaches
a
certain
limit
this
process
of
cell
division
can
not
be
claimed
even
metaphorically
to
exist
in
a
crystal
a
correct
appreciation
of
these
facts
will
give
us
an
insight
into
the
specific
difference
between
and
living
matter
the
formation
of
living
matter
consists
in
the
synthesis
of
the
proteins
nucleins
fats
and
carbohydrates
of
the
cells
from
split
products
the
essential
difference
between
living
and
matter
consists
then
in
this
the
living
cell
synthesizes
its
own
complicated
specific
material
from
indifferent
or
simple
compounds
of
the
surrounding
medium
while
the
crystal
simply
adds
the
molecules
found
in
its
supersaturated
solution
this
synthetic
power
of
transforming
small
building
stones
into
the
complicated
compounds
specific
for
each
organism
is
the
secret
of
life
or
rather
one
of
the
secrets
of
organism
as
a
by
jacques
loeb
it
will
be
explained
later
that
one
of
the
energetic
phenomena
of
organic
mind
which
is
one
of
the
energies
characteristic
of
this
class
of
phenomena
is
autonomous
is
and
true
to
its
dimensionality
if
we
analyse
the
classes
of
life
we
readily
find
that
there
are
three
cardinal
classes
which
are
radically
distinct
in
function
a
short
analysis
will
disclose
to
us
that
though
minerals
have
various
activities
they
are
not
the
plants
have
a
very
definite
and
well
known
transformation
of
solar
energy
into
organic
chemical
energy
they
are
a
class
of
life
which
appropriates
one
kind
of
energy
converts
it
into
another
kind
and
stores
it
up
in
that
sense
they
are
a
kind
of
storage
battery
for
the
solar
energy
and
so
i
define
the
plants
as
the
class
of
life
the
animals
use
the
highly
dynamic
products
of
the
food
and
those
results
of
in
animals
a
further
transformation
into
yet
higher
forms
and
the
animals
are
correspondingly
a
more
dynamic
class
of
life
their
energy
is
kinetic
they
have
a
remarkable
freedom
and
power
which
the
plants
do
not
mean
the
freedom
and
faculty
to
move
about
in
and
so
i
define
animals
as
the
class
of
life
and
now
what
shall
we
say
of
beings
what
is
to
be
our
definition
of
man
like
the
animals
human
beings
do
indeed
possess
the
capacity
but
over
and
above
that
human
beings
possess
a
most
remarkable
capacity
which
is
entirely
peculiar
to
mean
the
capacity
to
summarise
digest
and
appropriate
the
labors
and
experiences
of
the
past
i
mean
the
capacity
to
use
the
fruits
of
past
labors
and
experiences
as
intellectual
or
spiritual
capital
for
developments
in
the
present
i
mean
the
capacity
to
employ
as
instruments
of
increasing
power
the
accumulated
achievements
of
the
lives
of
the
past
generations
spent
in
trial
and
error
trial
and
success
i
mean
the
capacity
of
human
beings
to
conduct
their
lives
in
the
ever
increasing
light
of
inherited
wisdom
i
mean
the
capacity
in
virtue
of
which
man
is
at
once
the
heritor
of
the
ages
and
the
trustee
of
posterity
and
because
humanity
is
just
this
magnificent
natural
agency
by
which
the
past
lives
in
the
present
and
the
present
for
the
future
i
define
humanity
in
the
universal
tongue
of
mathematics
and
mechanics
to
be
the
class
of
life
these
definitions
of
the
cardinal
classes
of
life
are
it
will
be
noted
obtained
from
direct
observation
they
are
so
simple
and
so
important
that
i
can
not
the
necessity
of
grasping
them
and
most
especially
the
definition
of
man
for
these
simple
definitions
and
especially
that
of
humanity
will
profoundly
transform
the
whole
conception
of
human
life
in
every
field
of
interest
and
activity
and
what
is
more
important
than
all
the
definition
of
man
will
give
us
a
starting
point
for
discovering
the
laws
of
human
the
human
class
of
life
the
definitions
of
the
classes
of
life
represent
the
different
classes
as
distinct
in
respect
to
dimensionality
and
this
is
extremely
important
for
no
measure
or
rule
of
one
class
can
be
applied
to
the
other
making
grave
for
example
to
treat
a
human
being
as
an
a
mere
humans
have
certain
animal
propensities
is
an
error
of
the
same
type
and
grossness
as
to
treat
a
cube
as
a
surface
because
it
has
surface
properties
it
is
absolutely
essential
to
grasp
that
fact
if
we
are
ever
to
have
a
science
of
human
nature
we
can
represent
the
different
classes
of
life
in
three
life
coordinates
the
minerals
with
their
inorganic
activities

be
the
zero

by
the

the

their

their

to

such
diagrammatic
illustrations
must
not
be
taken
too
literally
they
are
like
figures
of
if
if
not
understood
the
reader
should
reflect
upon
the
simple
idea
of
dimensions
until
he
sees
clearly
that
the
idea
is
not
merely
a
thing
of
interest
or
of
convenience
but
is
absolutely
essential
as
a
means
of
discriminating
the
cardinal
classes
of
life
from
one
another
and
of
conceiving
each
class
to
be
what
it
is
instead
of
mixing
it
confusedly
with
something
radically
different
it
will
greatly
help
the
reader
if
he
will
retire
to
the
quiet
of
his
cloister
and
there
meditate
about
as
follows
a
line
has
one
dimension
a
plane
has
two
a
plane
contains
lines
and
so
it
has
line
it
has
other
it
is
these
that
are
peculiar
to
it
give
it
its
own
character
and
make
it
what
it
plane
and
not
a
line
so
animals
have
some
plant
grow
for
animals
have
other
mobility
for
example
of
higher
dimensionality
or
it
is
these
that
make
animals
and
not
plants
just
so
human
beings
have
certain
animal
mobility
for
example
or
physical
humans
have
other
properties
or
sense
for
example
logical
sense
inventiveness
or
propensities
of
higher
dimensionality
level
or
it
is
these
propensities
and
powers
that
make
human
beings
and
animal
when
and
only
when
this
fact
is
clearly
seen
and
keenly
realized
there
will
begin
the
of
science
and
art
of
then
and
only
then
we
shall
begin
to
escape
from
the
untold
immeasurable
evils
that
come
from
regarding
and
treating
human
beings
as
animals
as
mere
binders
of
space
and
we
may
look
forward
to
an
ethics
a
jurisprudence
and
economics
a
science
and
art
of
human
life
and
upon
the
laws
of
human
nature
because
based
upon
the
just
conception
of
humanity
as
the
class
of
life
creators
and
improvers
of
good
destined
to
endless
advancement
in
accord
with
the
potencies
of
human
nature
humanity
is
still
in
its
childhood
we
have
bound
so
little
time
in
the
course
of
the
centuries
which
are
so
brief
in
the
scheme
of
the
universe
at
the
bottom
of
every
human
activity
historical
fact
or
trend
of
civilization
there
lies
some
doctrine
or
conception
of
apples
had
fallen
from
trees
for
ages
but
without
any
important
results
in
the
economy
of
humanity
the
fact
that
a
fallen
apple
hit
newton
led
to
the
discovery
of
the
theory
of
gravitation
this
changed
our
whole
world
conception
our
sciences
and
our
activities
it
powerfully
stimulated
the
development
of
all
the
branches
of
natural
and
technological
knowledge
even
in
the
event
of
the
newtonian
laws
being
proved
to
be
not
quite
correct
they
have
served
a
great
purpose
in
enabling
us
to
understand
natural
phenomena
in
a
sufficiently
approximate
way
to
make
it
possible
to
build
up
modern
technology
and
to
develop
our
physical
science
to
the
point
where
it
was
necessary
and
possible
to
make
a
correction
of
the
newtonian
laws
a
similar
organic
change
in
our
conception
of
human
life
and
its
phenomena
is
involved
in
the
foregoing
definitions
of
the
classes
of
life
they
will
replace
basic
errors
with
scientific
truths
of
fundamental
importance
they
will
form
the
basis
for
scientific
development
of
a
permanent
civilization
in
place
of
the
periodically
convulsive
civilizations
of
the
past
and
present
to
know
the
cause
of
evil
and
error
is
to
find
the
cure
chapter
iv
what
is
man
man
has
ever
been
the
greatest
puzzle
to
man
there
are
many
and
important
reasons
for
this
fact
as
the
subject
of
this
book
is
not
a
theoretical
academic
study
of
man
of
which
too
many
have
already
been
written
i
will
not
recount
the
reasons
but
will
confine
myself
to
the
more
pressing
matters
of
the
task
in
hand
which
is
that
of
pointing
the
way
to
the
science
and
art
of
human
engineering
the
two
facts
which
have
to
be
dealt
with
first
are
the
two
which
have
most
retarded
human
progress
there
has
never
been
a
true
definition
of
man
nor
a
just
conception
of
his
rôle
in
the
curious
drama
of
the
world
in
consequence
of
which
there
has
never
been
a
proper
principle
or
starting
point
for
a
science
of
humanity
it
has
never
been
realized
that
man
is
a
being
of
a
dimension
or
type
different
from
that
of
animals
and
the
characteristic
nature
of
man
has
not
been
understood
man
has
always
been
regarded
either
as
an
animal
or
as
a
supernatural
phenomenon
the
facts
are
that
man
is
not
but
is
literally
a
part
of
nature
and
that
human
beings
are
not
animals
we
have
seen
that
the
animals
are
truly
characterized
by
their
autonomous
are
we
have
seen
that
human
beings
are
characterized
by
their
creative
power
by
the
power
to
make
the
past
live
in
the
present
and
the
present
for
the
future
by
their
capacity
to
bind
beings
are
these
concepts
are
basic
and
impersonal
arrived
at
mathematically
they
are
mathematically
correct
it
does
not
matter
at
all
the
first
man
the
first
was
produced
the
fact
remains
that
he
was
somewhere
somehow
produced
to
know
anything
that
is
of
fundamental
interest
about
man
we
have
to
analyse
man
in
three
three
capacities
namely
his
chemistry
his
activities
in
space
and
especially
his
activities
in
time
whereas
in
the
study
of
animals
we
have
to
consider
only
two
factors
their
chemistry
and
their
activities
in
space
let
us
imagine
that
the
human
specimen
was
one
of
two
brother
apes
and
they
were
alike
in
every
respect
both
were
animal
but
something
strange
happened
to
he
became
the
first
a
human
no
matter
how
this
something
made
the
change
in
him
that
lifted
him
to
a
higher
dimension
it
is
enough
that
in
over
and
above
his
animal
capacity
for
binding
space
there
was
superadded
the
marvelous
new
capacity
for
he
had
thus
a
new
faculty
he
belonged
to
a
new
dimension
but
of
course
he
did
not
realize
it
and
because
he
had
this
new
capacity
he
was
able
to
analyze
his
brother
he
observed
is
my
brother
he
is
an
animal
but
he
is
my
brother
therefore
am
an
this
fatal
first
conclusion
reached
by
false
analogy
by
neglecting
a
fact
has
been
the
chief
source
of
human
woe
for
half
a
million
years
and
it
still
survives
the
capacity
first
manifest
in
increased
more
and
more
with
the
days
and
each
generation
until
in
the
course
of
centuries
man
felt
himself
increasingly
somehow
different
from
the
animal
but
he
could
not
explain
he
said
to
himself
if
i
am
an
animal
there
is
also
in
me
something
higher
a
spark
of
some
thing
with
this
conclusion
he
estranged
himself
as
something
apart
from
nature
and
formulated
the
impasse
which
put
him
in
a
of
a
double
life
he
was
neither
true
to
the
supernatural
which
he
could
not
know
and
therefore
could
not
emulate
nor
was
he
true
to
the
animal
which
he
scorned
having
put
himself
outside
the
natural
laws
he
was
not
really
true
to
any
law
and
condemned
himself
to
a
life
of
hypocrisy
and
established
speculative
artificial
unnatural
laws
how
blind
our
familiar
assumptions
make
us
among
the
animals
man
at
least
has
long
been
wont
to
regard
himself
as
a
being
quite
apart
from
and
not
as
part
of
the
cosmos
round
about
him
from
this
he
has
detached
himself
in
thought
he
has
estranged
and
objectified
the
world
and
lost
the
sense
that
he
is
of
it
and
this
habit
and
point
of
view
which
has
fashioned
his
life
and
controlled
his
thought
lending
its
characteristic
mark
and
color
to
his
whole
philosophy
and
art
and
learning
is
still
maintained
partly
because
of
its
convenience
no
doubt
and
partly
by
force
of
inertia
and
sheer
conservatism
in
the
very
teeth
of
the
strongest
probabilities
of
biological
science
probably
no
other
single
hypothesis
has
less
to
recommend
it
and
yet
no
other
so
completely
dominates
the
human
cassius
keyser
loc
cit
and
this
monstrous
conception
is
current
millions
still
look
upon
man
as
a
mixture
of
animal
and
something
supernatural
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
engineering
of
human
society
is
a
difficult
and
complicated
problem
of
tremendous
ethical
responsibility
for
it
involves
the
welfare
of
mankind
throughout
an
unending
succession
of
generations
the
science
of
human
engineering
can
not
be
built
upon
false
conceptions
of
human
nature
it
can
not
be
built
on
the
conception
of
man
as
a
kind
of
animal
it
can
not
be
built
on
the
conception
of
man
as
a
mixture
of
natural
and
supernatural
it
must
be
built
upon
the
conception
of
man
as
being
at
once
natural
and
higher
in
dimensionality
than
the
animals
it
must
be
built
upon
the
scientific
conception
of
mankind
as
characterized
by
their
capacity
and
function
this
conception
radically
alters
our
whole
view
of
human
life
human
society
and
the
world
it
must
be
obvious
to
any
one
that
is
the
only
natural
criterion
and
standard
for
the
class
of
life
this
mighty
comprehended
will
be
found
to
embrace
the
whole
of
the
natural
laws
the
natural
ethics
the
natural
philosophy
the
natural
sociology
the
natural
economics
the
natural
governance
to
be
brought
into
the
education
of
then
really
peaceful
and
progressive
civilization
without
periodical
collapses
and
violent
readjustments
will
commence
not
before
everything
which
is
really
the
human
dimension
therefore
it
will
represent
every
quality
that
is
implied
in
such
words
while
everything
that
is
merely
will
be
classified
as
animal
and
be
thus
assessed
at
its
proper
value
those
ignorant
masters
of
our
destinies
who
regard
humans
as
animals
or
as
monstrous
hybrids
of
natural
and
supernatural
must
be
dethroned
by
scientific
education
humans
can
be
literally
poisoned
by
false
ideas
and
false
teachings
many
people
have
a
just
horror
at
the
thought
of
putting
poison
into
tea
or
coffee
but
seem
unable
to
realize
that
when
they
teach
false
ideas
and
false
doctrines
they
are
poisoning
the
capacity
of
their
fellow
men
and
women
one
has
to
stop
and
think
there
is
nothing
mystical
about
the
fact
that
ideas
and
words
are
energies
which
powerfully
affect
the
base
of
our
activities
humans
are
thus
made
untrue
to
human
hypnotism
is
a
known
fact
it
has
been
proved
that
a
man
can
be
so
hypnotized
that
in
a
certain
time
which
has
been
suggested
to
him
he
will
murder
or
commit
arson
or
theft
that
under
hypnotic
influence
the
personal
morale
of
the
individual
has
only
a
small
influence
upon
his
conduct
the
subject
obeys
the
hypnotic
suggestions
no
matter
how
immoral
they
are
the
conception
of
man
as
a
mixture
of
animal
and
supernatural
has
for
ages
kept
human
beings
under
the
deadly
spell
of
the
suggestion
that
animal
selfishness
and
animal
greediness
are
their
essential
character
and
the
spell
has
operated
to
suppress
their
real
human
nature
and
to
prevent
it
from
expressing
itself
naturally
and
freely
on
the
other
hand
when
human
beings
are
educated
to
a
lively
realization
that
they
are
by
creatures
then
they
will
spontaneously
live
in
accordance
with
their
nature
which
as
i
have
said
is
the
source
and
support
of
the
highest
ideals
what
is
achieved
in
blaming
a
man
for
being
selfish
and
greedy
if
he
acts
under
the
influence
of
a
social
environment
and
education
which
teach
him
that
he
is
an
animal
and
that
selfishness
and
greediness
are
of
the
essence
of
his
nature
even
so
eminent
a
philosopher
and
psychologist
as
spencer
tells
us
of
truths
so
dealt
with
the
one
which
here
concerns
us
is
that
a
creature
must
live
before
it
can
act
ethics
has
to
recognize
the
truth
that
egoism
comes
before
this
is
true
for
animals
because
animals
die
out
from
lack
of
food
when
their
natural
supply
of
it
is
insufficient
because
they
have
not
the
capacity
to
produce
artificially
but
it
is
not
true
for
the
human
dimension
why
not
because
humans
through
their
capacity
are
first
of
all
and
so
their
number
is
not
controlled
by
the
supply
of
unaided
nature
but
only
by
men
s
artificial
productivity
which
is
the
materialization
of
their
capacity
man
therefore
by
the
very
intrinsic
character
of
his
being
must
act
first
in
order
to
be
able
to
live
through
the
action
of
society
which
is
not
the
case
with
animals
the
misunderstanding
of
this
simple
truth
is
largely
accountable
for
the
evil
of
our
ethical
and
economic
systems
or
lack
of
systems
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
humanity
were
to
live
in
accord
with
the
animal
conception
of
man
artificial
cease
and
ninety
per
cent
of
mankind
would
perish
by
starvation
it
is
just
because
human
beings
are
not
animals
but
are
mere
finders
but
creators
of
food
and
they
are
able
to
live
in
such
vast
numbers
here
even
the
blind
must
see
the
effect
of
higher
dimensionality
and
this
effect
becomes
in
turn
the
cause
of
other
effects
which
produce
still
others
and
so
on
in
an
endless
chain
we
live
because
we
produce
because
we
are
acting
in
time
and
are
not
merely
acting
in
man
is
not
a
kind
of
animal
it
is
all
so
simple
if
only
we
apply
a
little
sound
logic
in
our
thinking
about
human
nature
and
human
affairs
if
human
ethics
are
to
be
human
are
to
be
in
the
human
dimension
the
postulates
of
ethics
must
be
changed
for
humanity
in
order
to
live
must
act
first
the
laws
of
laws
of
right
of
human
having
their
whole
source
and
sanction
in
the
capacity
and
activity
peculiar
to
man
human
excellence
is
excellence
in
and
must
be
measured
and
rewarded
by
standards
of
worth
humanity
in
order
to
live
must
produce
creatively
and
therefore
must
be
guided
by
applied
science
by
technology
and
this
means
that
the
social
sciences
of
ethics
jurisprudence
psychology
economics
sociology
politics
and
government
must
be
emancipated
from
medieval
metaphysics
they
must
be
made
scientific
they
must
be
they
must
be
made
to
progress
and
to
function
in
the
proper
human
dimension
and
not
that
of
animals
they
must
be
made
sciences
can
this
be
done
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
can
for
what
is
human
life
after
all
to
a
general
in
the
battlefield
human
life
is
a
factor
which
if
properly
used
can
destroy
the
enemy
to
an
engineer
human
life
is
an
equivalent
to
energy
or
a
capacity
to
do
work
mental
or
muscular
and
the
moment
something
is
found
to
be
a
source
of
energy
and
to
have
the
capacity
of
doing
work
the
first
thing
to
do
from
the
engineer
s
point
of
view
is
to
analyse
the
generator
with
a
view
to
discovering
how
best
to
conserve
it
to
improve
it
and
bring
it
to
the
level
of
maximum
productivity
human
beings
are
very
complicated
batteries
differing
widely
in
quality
and
magnitude
of
productive
power
experience
has
shown
that
these
batteries
are
first
of
all
chemical
batteries
producing
a
mysterious
energy
if
these
batteries
are
not
supplied
periodically
with
a
more
or
less
constant
quantity
of
some
chemical
elements
called
food
and
air
the
batteries
will
cease
to
will
die
in
the
examination
of
the
structure
of
these
batteries
we
find
that
the
chemical
base
is
very
much
accentuated
all
through
the
structure
this
chemical
generator
is
divided
into
branches
each
of
which
has
a
very
different
rôle
which
it
must
perform
in
harmony
with
all
the
others
the
mechanical
parts
of
the
structure
are
built
in
conformity
to
the
rules
of
mechanics
and
are
automatically
furnished
with
lubrication
and
with
chemical
supplies
for
automatically
renewing
parts
the
chemical
processes
not
only
deposit
particles
of
mass
for
the
structure
of
the
generator
but
produce
some
very
powerful
unknown
kinds
of
energies
or
vibrations
which
make
all
the
chemical
parts
function
we
find
also
a
mysterious
apparatus
with
a
complex
of
wires
which
we
call
brain
glands
and
nerves
and
finally
these
human
batteries
have
the
remarkable
capacity
of
reproduction
these
functions
are
familiar
to
everybody
from
the
knowledge
of
other
physical
mechanical
and
chemical
phenomena
of
nature
we
must
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
human
battery
is
the
most
perfect
example
of
a
complex
engine
it
has
all
the
peculiarities
of
a
chemical
battery
combined
with
a
generator
of
a
peculiar
energy
called
life
above
all
it
has
mental
or
spiritual
capacities
it
is
thus
equipped
with
both
mental
and
mechanical
means
for
producing
work
the
parts
and
functions
of
this
marvelous
engine
have
been
the
subject
of
a
vast
amount
of
research
in
various
special
branches
of
science
a
very
noteworthy
fact
is
that
both
the
physical
work
and
the
mental
work
of
this
human
engine
are
always
accompanied
by
both
physical
and
chemical
changes
in
the
structure
of
its
to
the
wear
and
tear
of
engines
it
also
presents
certain
sexual
and
spiritual
phenomena
that
have
a
striking
likeness
to
certain
phenomena
especially
wireless
phenomena
to
electricity
and
to
radium
this
human
is
of
unusual
strength
durability
and
perfection
and
yet
it
is
very
liable
to
damage
and
even
wreckage
if
not
properly
used
the
controlling
factors
are
very
delicate
and
so
the
engine
is
very
capricious
very
special
training
and
understanding
are
necessary
for
its
control
the
reader
may
wish
to
ask
what
is
the
essence
of
the
power
of
man
talk
of
essences
is
is
not
scientific
let
me
explain
by
an
example
what
is
electricity
the
scientific
answer
is
electricity
is
that
which
exhibits
such
and
such
phenomena
electricity
means
nothing
but
a
certain
group
of
phenomena
called
electric
we
are
studying
electricity
when
we
are
studying
those
phenomena
thus
it
is
in
is
no
talk
of
essences
so
too
in
human
shall
not
talk
of
the
of
but
only
of
the
phenomena
and
the
laws
thereof
what
has
led
to
the
development
of
electric
appliances
is
knowledge
of
electrical
metaphysical
talk
about
the
electrical
essence
and
what
will
lead
to
the
science
and
art
of
human
engineering
is
knowledge
of
vain
babble
about
an
essence
of
power
there
is
no
mystery
about
the
word
some
descriptive
term
was
necessary
to
indicate
that
human
capacity
which
discriminates
human
beings
from
animals
and
marks
man
as
man
for
that
appropriateness
of
the
term
becomes
more
and
more
manifest
upon
reflection
what
are
the
conditions
of
life
upon
this
earth
is
there
war
or
peace
in
daily
life
all
living
beings
require
food
they
multiply
in
a
geometrical
ratio
and
so
the
productivity
of
the
soil
becomes
increasingly
inadequate
the
tendency
to
increase
in
geometrical
ratio
is
true
of
all
animal
and
human
but
the
tendency
is
checked
by
various
counteracting
influences
natural
and
artificial
a
short
time
ago
these
checks
had
so
operated
to
annul
the
law
of
increase
as
almost
to
stop
the
growth
of
human
population
it
is
only
by
the
capacity
of
scientific
progress
and
technological
the
checks
have
been
overcome
and
so
in
the
last
century
the
population
of
europe
increased
more
than
it
had
increased
in
several
centuries
before
impoverished
soil
excessive
heat
or
cold
excessive
moisture
the
lack
of
and
many
other
factors
are
hostile
to
life
it
is
evident
therefore
that
human
life
must
especially
struggle
for
existence
it
must
carry
on
a
perpetual
contest
for
self
preservation
it
seems
obvious
that
if
there
is
perpetual
war
in
life
war
methods
must
be
applied
we
have
just
passed
through
a
tremendous
war
and
we
developed
special
ways
of
producing
power
to
overcome
the
enemy
we
were
thus
driven
to
discover
some
of
the
hidden
sources
of
power
and
all
of
our
old
habits
and
ideas
were
bent
toward
military
methods
and
military
technology
the
war
of
life
against
hostile
elements
is
war
for
the
subjugation
of
physical
nature
and
not
for
the
conquest
of
people
it
is
a
war
carried
on
by
the
power
of
men
pitted
against
natural
obstacles
and
its
progressive
triumph
means
progressive
advancement
in
human
weal
the
lesson
of
the
world
war
should
not
be
missed
through
failure
to
analyse
it
when
nations
war
with
nations
the
normal
daily
war
of
millions
and
millions
of
individuals
to
subjugate
natural
resources
to
human
uses
is
interrupted
and
the
fruits
of
measureless
toil
are
destroyed
but
peaceful
war
war
for
the
conquest
of
nature
involves
the
use
of
methods
of
technology
and
what
is
even
more
important
technological
philosophy
law
and
ethics
what
i
want
to
emphasize
in
this
little
book
is
the
need
of
a
thoroughgoing
revision
of
our
ideas
and
the
revision
must
be
made
by
engineering
minds
in
order
that
our
ideas
may
be
made
to
match
facts
if
we
are
ill
we
consult
a
physician
or
a
surgeon
not
a
charlatan
we
must
learn
that
when
there
is
trouble
with
the
producing
power
of
the
world
we
have
to
consult
an
engineer
an
expert
on
power
politicians
diplomats
and
lawyers
do
not
understand
the
problem
what
i
am
advocating
is
that
we
must
learn
to
ask
those
who
know
how
to
produce
things
instead
of
asking
those
whose
profession
is
to
fight
for
the
division
of
things
produced
by
nature
or
by
other
human
beings
as
a
matter
of
fact
our
civilization
has
been
for
a
long
time
disorganized
to
the
point
of
disease
lately
through
the
whirl
of
changing
conditions
due
to
the
great
release
of
power
in
the
giant
technology
the
disorganization
has
become
acute
the
sick
seldom
know
the
cure
for
themselves
if
the
cure
is
to
be
enduring
we
have
to
go
to
the
source
and
this
can
be
done
only
by
men
familiar
not
only
with
effects
but
also
with
the
causes
money
is
not
the
wealth
of
a
nation
but
production
is
wealth
so
is
the
main
object
for
humanity
but
to
have
the
maximum
of
production
it
is
necessary
to
have
production
put
on
a
sound
basis
no
mere
preaching
of
brotherly
love
or
class
hatred
will
produce
one
single
brick
for
the
building
of
the
future
temple
of
human
temple
of
civilization
ordered
production
demands
analysis
of
basic
facts
this
era
is
essentially
an
industrial
era
to
produce
we
have
to
have
raw
material
or
soil
instruments
for
and
machines
and
the
application
of
power
the
three
requirements
may
be
briefly
characterized
and
appraised
as
follows
raw
material
and
soil
are
products
of
nature
humanity
simply
took
them
and
had
the
use
of
them
for
nothing
because
it
is
impossible
to
call
a
prayer
of
thanksgiving
if
any
addressed
to
a
creator
as
payment
to
gods
or
men
but
raw
material
and
soil
in
the
conditions
in
which
nature
produces
them
are
of
very
little
immediate
benefit
to
humanity
because
unfilled
soil
produces
very
little
food
for
humans
and
raw
material
such
as
wood
coal
oil
iron
copper
are
completely
useless
to
humanity
until
after
human
work
is
applied
to
them
it
is
necessary
to
cut
a
tree
for
the
making
of
timber
it
is
necessary
to
excavate
the
minerals
and
even
then
only
by
applying
further
human
work
is
it
possible
to
make
them
available
for
any
human
use
so
it
is
obvious
that
even
raw
materials
in
the
form
in
which
nature
has
produced
them
are
mostly
of
no
value
and
unavailable
for
use
unless
reproduced
through
the
process
of
human
creative
therefore
we
may
well
conclude
that
raw
material
must
be
divided
into
two
very
distinct
classes
raw
material
as
produced
by
s
free
in
its
original
form
and
place
has
practically
no
and
raw
material
reproduced
by
man
s
mental
and
muscular
activities
by
his
capacities
raw
materials
of
the
second
class
have
an
enormous
indeed
they
make
the
existence
of
humanity
possible
as
to
the
second
requirement
for
production
namely
tools
and
machines
it
is
obvious
that
tools
and
machines
are
made
of
raw
material
by
human
work
mental
and
muscular
and
finally
the
application
of
power
different
sources
of
natural
energy
and
power
are
known
the
most
important
available
source
of
energy
for
this
globe
is
the
heat
of
the
sun
this
solar
heat
is
the
origin
of
water
power
of
wind
power
and
of
the
power
bound
up
in
coal
of
the
chemistry
growth
and
transforming
agency
of
plants
all
foods
which
the
animals
as
well
as
the
humans
use
are
already
the
result
of
the
solar
energy
transformed
into
what
may
be
called
chemical
energy
transformation
of
energies
is
building
up
of
life
it
is
to
be
clearly
seen
that
the
only
source
of
energy
which
can
be
directly
appropriated
and
used
by
man
or
animal
is
vegetable
food
found
in
the
wilderness
no
other
sources
of
power
are
available
for
use
they
have
first
to
be
mastered
and
directed
by
human
brain
the
same
is
true
in
regard
to
the
getting
of
animal
food
the
creation
of
a
or
windmill
or
a
steam
engine
or
the
art
of
using
a
team
of
horses
or
a
bushel
of
wheat
these
are
not
available
except
by
the
use
of
the
human
power
this
short
survey
of
facts
known
to
everybody
brings
us
to
the
conclusion
that
all
problems
of
production
come
ultimately
to
the
analysis
of
natural
resources
of
raw
material
and
natural
energy
freely
supplied
by
nature
which
as
we
have
seen
in
the
form
as
produced
by
nature
alone
have
very
little
or
no
value
for
humanity
the
activity
of
the
human
brain
because
human
muscles
are
always
directed
by
the
brain
which
gives
value
to
the
otherwise
useless
raw
materials
and
energies
hence
to
understand
the
processes
of
production
it
is
essential
to
realize
that
humanity
is
able
to
survive
only
by
virtue
of
the
capacity
of
humans
to
exploit
natural
convert
the
products
of
nature
into
forms
available
for
human
needs
if
humanity
had
only
the
capacity
of
apes
depending
exclusively
on
wild
fruits
and
the
like
they
would
be
confined
to
those
comparatively
small
regions
of
the
globe
where
the
climate
and
the
fertility
of
the
soil
are
specially
favorable
but
in
the
case
supposed
humans
would
not
be
humans
they
would
not
be
would
be
there
are
other
facts
which
must
be
kept
constantly
in
mind
one
of
them
is
that
in
the
world
in
which
we
live
there
are
natural
laws
of
inorganic
as
well
as
organic
phenomena
another
of
the
facts
is
as
before
said
that
the
human
class
of
life
has
the
peculiar
capacity
of
establishing
the
social
laws
and
customs
which
regulate
and
influence
its
destinies
which
help
or
hinder
the
processes
of
production
upon
which
the
lives
and
happiness
of
mankind
essentially
and
fundamentally
depend
it
must
not
be
lost
sight
of
in
this
connection
that
the
human
class
of
life
is
a
part
and
a
product
of
nature
and
that
therefore
there
must
be
laws
which
are
natural
for
this
class
of
a
stone
obeys
the
natural
laws
of
stones
a
liquid
conforms
to
the
natural
law
of
liquids
a
plant
to
the
natural
laws
of
plants
an
animal
to
the
natural
laws
of
animals
it
follows
inevitably
that
there
be
natural
laws
for
humans
but
here
the
problem
becomes
more
complicated
for
the
stone
the
plant
and
the
animal
do
not
possess
the
intellectual
power
to
create
and
initiate
and
so
must
blindly
obey
the
laws
that
are
natural
for
them
they
are
not
free
to
determine
their
own
destinies
not
so
with
man
man
has
the
capacity
and
he
can
through
ignorance
or
neglect
or
deviate
from
or
misinterpret
the
natural
laws
for
the
human
class
of
life
just
therein
lies
the
secret
and
the
source
of
human
chaos
and
fact
of
such
tremendous
importance
that
it
can
not
be
and
it
seems
impossible
to
evade
it
longer
to
discover
the
nature
of
man
and
the
laws
of
that
marks
the
summit
of
human
enterprises
for
to
solve
this
is
to
open
the
way
to
everything
which
can
be
of
importance
to
human
welfare
and
happiness
the
great
problem
has
been
felt
as
a
powerful
impulse
throughout
the
ages
of
human
striving
for
in
all
times
it
has
been
evident
to
thinkers
that
upon
the
right
solution
of
the
problem
must
forever
depend
the
welfare
of
mankind
many
solutions
have
been
offered
and
though
they
have
differed
widely
they
agree
in
one
have
had
a
common
fate
of
being
false
what
has
been
the
trouble
the
trouble
has
been
in
every
instance
a
radical
misconception
of
what
a
human
being
really
is
the
problem
is
to
discover
the
natural
laws
of
the
human
class
of
life
all
the
solutions
offered
in
the
course
of
history
and
those
which
are
current
are
of
two
and
only
two
and
the
zoological
solutions
are
those
which
grow
out
of
the
false
conception
according
to
which
human
beings
are
animals
if
humans
are
animals
the
laws
of
human
nature
are
the
laws
of
animal
nature
and
so
the
social
sciences
of
ethics
law
politics
economics
government
become
nothing
but
branches
of
zoology
as
sciences
they
are
the
studies
of
animal
life
as
arts
they
are
the
arts
of
managing
and
controlling
animals
according
to
this
zoological
philosophy
human
wisdom
about
human
beings
is
animal
wisdom
about
animals
the
mythological
solutions
are
those
which
start
with
the
monstrous
conception
according
to
which
human
beings
have
no
proper
place
in
nature
but
are
mixtures
of
natural
and
or
combinations
of
animality
and
divinity
such
solutions
contain
no
conception
of
law
scientifically
judged
they
are
mythological
chattering
of
crude
and
irresponsible
no
doubt
but
silly
and
deadly
in
their
effects
upon
the
interests
of
mankind
vitiating
ethics
law
economics
politics
and
government
such
have
been
and
still
are
the
regnant
philosophies
of
human
nature
what
is
the
remedy
how
are
the
laws
of
human
nature
to
be
discovered
it
is
evident
that
the
enterprise
like
all
other
scientific
enterprises
must
be
based
upon
and
guided
by
realities
it
is
essential
to
realize
that
the
great
central
dominant
reality
is
the
reality
of
if
we
misconceive
this
fundamental
matter
the
enterprise
must
fail
that
is
both
logically
clear
and
clear
in
the
sad
light
of
history
but
if
we
conceive
it
aright
we
may
confidently
expect
the
enterprise
to
prosper
that
is
why
in
the
chapter
on
the
classes
of
life
i
have
laid
so
much
stress
on
the
absolute
necessity
of
conceiving
man
as
being
what
he
really
is
and
not
something
else
and
we
have
discovered
what
man
is
we
have
discovered
that
man
is
characterized
by
the
capacity
or
power
to
bind
time
and
so
we
have
humanity
as
the
class
of
life
that
concept
is
fundamental
it
contains
the
germ
of
the
science
and
art
of
human
engineering
the
problem
of
discovering
and
applying
the
laws
of
human
nature
is
the
problem
of
discovering
and
applying
to
the
conduct
of
life
the
laws
of
this
fact
must
be
firmly
seized
and
kept
steadily
in
mind
energy
we
have
noted
is
the
capacity
to
do
work
in
human
economy
work
may
be
or
or
these
words
have
no
significance
except
in
human
economy
the
energy
of
the
human
intellect
is
a
energy
for
it
is
able
to
direct
to
use
to
transform
other
energies
this
energy
is
of
higher
higher
the
other
natural
energies
which
it
directs
controls
uses
and
transforms
this
higher
is
commonly
called
the
mental
or
spiritual
power
of
because
it
makes
past
achievements
live
in
the
present
and
present
activities
in
it
is
an
energy
that
initiates
it
is
an
energy
that
creates
it
is
an
energy
that
can
understand
the
past
and
foretell
the
is
both
historian
and
prophet
it
is
an
energy
that
loads
vehicle
of
an
burden
of
intellectual
achievements
of
spiritual
wealth
destined
for
the
civilization
of
posterity
and
what
is
the
natural
law
of
the
increase
what
is
the
natural
law
of
human
advancements
in
all
great
matters
of
human
concern
the
question
is
of
utmost
importance
both
theoretically
and
practically
for
the
it
a
law
of
human
law
of
the
energy
of
man
what
the
law
we
have
already
noted
the
law
of
arithmetical
progression
and
the
law
of
geometric
progression
we
have
seen
the
immense
difference
between
them
and
we
have
seen
that
the
natural
law
of
human
progress
in
each
and
every
cardinal
matter
is
a
law
like
that
of
a
rapidly
increasing
geometric
progression
in
other
words
the
natural
law
of
human
natural
law
of
amelioration
in
human
fundamental
law
of
human
basic
law
of
the
energy
peculiar
to
a
logarithmic
law
of
logarithmic
increase
i
beg
the
reader
not
to
let
the
term
bewilder
him
but
to
make
it
his
own
it
is
easy
to
understand
and
its
significance
is
mighty
and
everlasting
even
its
mathematical
formulation
can
be
understood
by
boys
and
girls
let
us
see
how
the
formulation
looks
suppose
to
denote
the
amount
of
progress
made
in
some
important
field
by
a
given
we
may
call
the
first
generation
where
denotes
the
common
ratio
of
is
the
number
by
which
the
progress
of
one
generation
must
be
multiplied
to
give
the
amount
of
progress
made
by
the
next
generation
then
the
amount
of
progress
made
by
the
second
generation
will
be
that
made
by
the
third
generation
will
be
and
so
on
now
denote
by
the
number
of
generations
counting
the
first
one
and
all
that
follow
in
endless
succession
then
the
following
series
will
show
the
law
of
human
progress
in
the
chosen
field
notice
how
it
goes
the
first
generation
ends
with
pr
the
second
generation
starts
with
adds
and
ends
with
the
third
generation
starts
with
adds
and
ends
with
and
so
on
and
on
the
made
in
the
generation
is
total
made
in
generations
is
this
total
gain
is
given
by
the
formula
total
gain
in
t
generations
r
if
we
take
to
be
which
is
a
very
small
ratio
requiring
the
progress
of
each
generation
to
be
merely
double
that
of
the
preceding
one
and
if
we
take
to
be
say
then
we
see
that
the
progress
made
by
the
single
generation
is
which
is
times
the
progress
made
in
the
first
generation
and
we
readily
compute
that
the
total
gain
in
generations
is
times
the
progress
made
in
the
first
generation
moreover
to
gain
a
just
sense
of
the
impressiveness
of
this
law
the
reader
must
reflect
upon
the
fact
that
it
operates
not
merely
on
one
field
but
in
all
fields
of
human
interest
operates
in
all
fields
i
have
just
now
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
before
pointed
out
it
does
not
so
operate
in
fields
nor
has
it
ever
done
so
my
point
is
that
it
so
operate
when
we
once
acquire
sense
enough
to
let
it
do
so
that
sense
we
shall
have
when
and
only
when
we
discover
that
by
nature
we
are
and
that
the
of
our
capacity
is
not
only
a
function
of
time
but
is
as
i
have
explained
a
logarithmic
or
exponential
function
of
function
in
which
time
enters
as
an
as
in
the
expression
so
that
we
humans
are
unlike
animals
naturally
qualified
not
only
to
progress
but
to
progress
more
and
more
rapidly
with
an
always
as
the
generations
pass
this
great
fact
is
to
be
at
once
the
basis
the
regulator
and
guide
in
the
science
and
art
of
human
engineering
whatever
squares
with
that
law
of
human
energy
is
right
and
makes
for
human
weal
whatever
contravenes
it
is
wrong
and
makes
for
human
woe
and
so
i
repeat
that
the
world
will
have
uninterrupted
peaceful
progress
when
and
only
when
the
social
sciences
sciences
of
ethics
law
philosophy
economics
religion
politics
and
technologized
when
and
only
when
they
are
made
genuinely
scientific
in
spirit
and
method
for
then
and
only
then
will
they
advance
like
the
natural
mathematical
and
technological
sciences
in
conformity
to
the
fundamental
exponential
law
of
the
nature
of
man
then
and
then
only
by
the
equal
pace
of
progress
in
all
cardinal
matters
the
equilibrium
of
social
institutions
will
remain
stable
and
social
cataclysms
cease
chapter
wealth
i
beg
the
reader
to
allow
me
to
begin
this
chapter
with
a
word
of
warning
the
reader
is
aware
that
which
i
mean
be
any
one
of
three
kinds
it
may
be
purely
destructive
it
may
be
purely
constructive
or
it
may
be
both
destructive
and
constructive
at
the
same
time
purely
destructive
criticism
is
sometimes
highly
useful
if
an
old
idea
or
a
system
of
old
ideas
be
false
and
therefore
harmful
it
is
a
genuine
service
to
attack
it
and
destroy
it
even
if
nothing
be
offered
to
take
its
place
just
as
it
is
good
to
destroy
a
rattlesnake
lurking
by
a
human
pathway
even
if
one
does
not
offer
a
substitute
for
the
snake
but
however
useful
destructive
criticism
may
be
it
is
not
an
easy
service
to
render
for
old
ideas
however
false
and
harmful
are
protected
alike
by
habit
and
by
the
inborn
conservatism
of
many
minds
now
habit
indeed
is
exceedingly
indispensable
to
the
effective
conduct
of
it
enables
us
to
do
many
useful
things
automatically
and
therefore
easily
without
conscious
thinking
and
thus
to
save
our
mental
energy
for
other
work
but
for
the
same
reason
habit
is
often
very
harmful
it
makes
us
protect
false
ideas
automatically
and
so
when
the
destructive
critic
endeavors
to
destroy
such
ideas
by
reasoning
with
us
he
finds
that
he
is
trying
to
reason
with
machines
such
is
the
chief
difficulty
encountered
by
destructive
criticism
on
the
other
hand
purely
constructive
constructive
in
introducing
new
ideas
of
a
kind
that
do
not
clash
or
do
not
seem
to
clash
with
old
ones
is
such
criticism
or
thought
easy
far
from
it
it
has
difficulties
of
its
own
these
are
of
two
varieties
the
difficulty
of
showing
people
who
are
content
with
their
present
stock
of
old
ideas
that
the
new
ones
are
interesting
or
important
and
the
great
difficulty
of
making
ideas
clear
and
intelligible
for
the
art
of
being
clear
and
perfectly
intelligible
is
very
very
hard
to
acquire
and
to
practise
the
third
kind
of
third
kind
of
kind
that
is
at
once
both
destructive
and
a
double
of
destroying
old
ideas
that
are
false
and
that
of
replacing
them
with
new
ideas
that
are
true
and
so
the
third
kind
of
criticism
or
thought
is
the
most
difficult
of
all
for
it
has
to
overcome
both
the
difficulty
of
destructive
criticism
and
that
of
constructive
thought
the
reader
therefore
if
he
will
be
good
enough
to
reflect
a
little
upon
the
matter
can
not
fail
to
appreciate
the
tremendous
difficulties
which
beset
the
writing
of
this
little
book
for
he
must
perceive
not
only
that
the
work
belongs
to
the
third
kind
of
critical
thought
is
much
errors
it
aims
to
destroy
are
fundamental
and
old
while
the
true
ideas
it
seeks
to
substitute
for
them
are
fundamental
and
new
this
great
difficulty
felt
at
stage
of
this
writing
is
for
a
reason
to
be
presently
explained
greatly
enhanced
and
felt
with
especial
keenness
in
the
present
chapter
i
therefore
beg
the
reader
to
give
me
here
very
special
cooperation
of
candor
and
critical
attention
it
is
essential
to
keep
in
mind
the
nature
of
our
enterprise
as
a
whole
which
is
that
of
pointing
the
way
to
the
science
and
art
of
human
engineering
and
laying
the
foundations
thereof
we
have
seen
human
engineering
when
developed
is
to
be
the
science
and
art
of
so
directing
human
energies
and
capacities
as
to
make
them
contribute
most
effectively
to
the
advancement
of
human
welfare
we
have
seen
that
this
science
and
art
must
have
its
basis
in
a
true
conception
of
human
just
conception
of
what
man
really
is
and
of
his
natural
place
in
the
complex
of
the
world
we
have
seen
that
the
and
still
current
conceptions
of
and
mythological
conceptions
according
to
which
human
beings
are
either
animals
or
else
hybrids
of
animals
and
mainly
responsible
for
the
dismal
things
in
human
history
we
have
seen
that
man
far
from
being
an
animal
or
a
compound
of
natural
and
supernatural
is
a
perfectly
natural
being
characterized
by
a
certain
capacity
or
capacity
or
power
to
bind
time
we
have
seen
that
humanity
is
therefore
to
be
rightly
conceived
and
scientifically
defined
as
the
class
of
life
we
have
seen
that
therefore
the
laws
of
energies
and
phenomena
are
the
laws
of
human
nature
we
have
seen
that
this
conception
of
must
be
the
basic
concept
the
fundamental
principle
and
the
perpetual
guide
and
regulator
of
human
bound
to
work
a
profound
transformation
in
all
our
views
on
human
affairs
and
in
particular
must
radically
alter
the
social
sciences
sciences
of
ethics
sociology
economics
politics
and
them
from
their
present
estate
of
pseudo
sciences
to
the
level
of
genuine
sciences
and
technologizing
them
for
the
effective
service
of
mankind
i
call
them
not
because
they
play
a
more
important
part
in
human
affairs
than
do
the
genuine
sciences
of
mathematics
physics
chemistry
astronomy
and
biology
for
they
are
not
more
important
than
these
but
because
they
are
so
to
say
closer
more
immediate
and
more
obvious
in
their
influence
and
effects
these
sciences
are
of
course
not
independent
they
depend
ultimately
upon
the
genuine
sciences
for
much
of
their
power
and
ought
to
go
to
them
for
light
and
guidance
but
what
i
mean
here
by
saying
they
are
not
independent
is
that
they
are
dependent
upon
each
other
interpenetrating
and
interlocking
in
innumerable
ways
to
show
how
the
sciences
will
have
to
be
transformed
to
make
them
accord
with
the
right
conception
of
man
and
qualify
them
for
their
proper
business
will
eventually
require
a
large
volume
or
indeed
volumes
in
this
introductory
work
i
can
not
deal
fully
with
one
of
those
sciences
nor
in
suitable
outline
with
each
of
them
separately
i
must
be
content
here
to
deal
very
briefly
with
one
of
them
by
way
of
illustration
and
suggestion
which
one
shall
it
be
now
among
these
sciences
there
is
one
specially
marked
by
the
importance
of
its
subject
by
its
central
relation
to
the
others
and
by
its
prominence
in
the
public
mind
i
mean
dismal
science
of
political
economy
for
that
reason
i
have
chosen
to
deal
with
economics
in
the
present
chapter
i
shall
discuss
three
of
its
principal
capital
and
a
view
to
showing
that
the
current
meanings
and
interpretations
of
these
familiar
terms
must
be
very
greatly
deepened
enlarged
and
elevated
if
they
are
to
accord
with
facts
and
laws
of
human
nature
and
if
the
science
which
employs
them
is
to
become
a
genuine
science
properly
qualified
to
be
a
branch
of
human
engineering
it
is
to
be
shown
that
the
meanings
currently
attached
by
political
economists
and
others
to
the
terms
in
question
belong
to
what
i
have
called
the
period
of
humanity
s
childhood
and
it
is
to
be
shown
that
the
new
meanings
which
the
terms
must
receive
belong
to
the
period
of
humanity
s
manhood
it
will
be
seen
that
the
new
meanings
differ
so
radically
from
the
old
ones
as
to
make
it
desirable
for
the
sake
of
clarity
to
give
the
new
meanings
new
names
but
this
however
scientifically
desirable
is
impracticable
because
the
old
capital
so
deeply
imbedded
in
the
speech
of
the
world
and
here
comes
into
view
the
very
special
difficulty
alluded
to
above
and
which
led
me
to
request
the
reader
s
special
cooperation
in
this
chapter
the
difficulty
is
not
merely
that
of
destroying
old
ideas
that
are
false
it
is
not
merely
that
of
replacing
them
with
true
ideas
that
are
new
it
is
that
of
causing
people
habitually
to
associate
meanings
that
are
new
and
true
with
terms
associated
so
long
so
universally
so
uniformly
with
meanings
that
are
false
the
secret
of
philosophy
said
leibnitz
is
to
treat
familiar
things
as
unfamiliar
by
the
secret
of
philosophy
leibnitz
meant
the
secret
of
what
we
call
science
let
us
apply
this
wholesome
maxim
in
our
present
study
let
us
in
so
far
as
we
can
regard
the
familiar
capital
and
unfamiliar
let
us
deal
with
them
afresh
let
us
examine
openmindedly
the
which
the
terms
relate
and
ascertain
scientifically
the
significance
the
terms
must
have
in
a
genuine
science
of
human
economy
examine
the
facts
i
the
phenomena
bending
facts
to
theories
is
a
vital
danger
while
bending
theories
to
facts
is
essential
to
science
and
the
peaceful
progress
of
society
human
beings
have
always
had
some
sense
of
perception
or
cognition
of
values
in
order
to
express
or
measure
values
it
was
necessary
to
introduce
units
of
measure
or
units
of
exchange
people
began
to
measure
values
by
means
of
agricultural
and
other
products
such
as
cattle
for
example
the
latin
word
for
cattle
was
and
the
word
which
came
to
signify
money
accounts
for
the
meaning
of
our
familiar
word
pecuniary
the
earliest
units
for
measuring
became
unsuited
to
the
increasing
needs
of
growing
trade
business
or
traffic
finally
a
unit
called
money
was
adopted
in
which
the
base
was
the
value
of
some
weight
of
gold
thus
we
see
that
money
came
to
mean
simply
the
accepted
unit
for
measuring
representing
and
expressing
values
of
and
in
wealth
but
what
is
wealth
i
have
said
that
the
old
conceptions
of
wealth
capital
and
conceptions
that
are
still
current
throughout
the
to
the
period
of
humanity
s
are
childish
conceptions
i
have
said
that
they
must
be
replaced
by
scientific
conceptions
fit
for
humanity
s
manhood
the
change
that
must
be
made
in
our
conceptions
of
the
great
terms
is
tremendous
it
is
necessary
to
analyse
the
current
conceptions
of
wealth
capital
and
childish
conceptions
of
order
to
reveal
their
falseness
stupidity
and
folly
to
do
this
we
must
enter
the
field
of
political
field
beset
with
peculiar
difficulties
and
dangers
all
the
furies
of
private
interests
are
involved
one
gains
the
impression
that
there
is
little
or
no
real
desire
to
gain
a
true
scientific
wealth
everybody
seems
to
prefer
an
emotional
definition
that
suits
his
personal
love
of
wealth
or
his
hatred
of
it
many
definitions
of
wealth
capital
and
money
are
to
be
found
in
modern
books
of
political
and
books
belonging
to
humanity
s
childhood
for
the
purpose
of
this
writing
they
all
of
them
look
sufficiently
are
all
of
them
childish
mill
for
example
tells
us
that
wealth
consists
of
useful
or
agreeable
things
which
possess
exchangeable
of
capital
one
of
the
simplest
definitions
is
this
capital
is
that
part
of
wealth
which
is
devoted
to
obtaining
further
alfred
marshall
of
walker
in
his
trade
and
defines
money
as
follows
money
is
that
which
passes
freely
from
hand
to
hand
throughout
the
community
in
final
discharge
of
debts
and
full
payment
for
commodities
being
accepted
equally
without
reference
to
the
character
or
credit
of
the
person
who
offers
it
and
without
the
intention
of
the
person
who
receives
it
to
consume
it
or
to
enjoy
it
or
apply
it
to
any
other
use
than
in
turn
to
tender
it
to
others
in
discharge
of
debts
or
full
payment
for
political
economy
has
many
different
schools
of
thought
and
methods
of
classification
its
reasonings
are
mainly
speculative
metaphysical
and
legalistic
its
ethics
is
zoological
ethics
based
on
the
zoological
conception
of
man
as
an
animal
the
elements
of
natural
logic
and
natural
ethics
are
absent
the
sophisticated
ideas
about
the
subject
of
political
economy
bluntly
do
not
correspond
to
facts
our
primitive
forefather
in
the
jungle
would
have
died
from
hunger
cold
heat
blood
poisoning
or
the
attacks
of
wild
animals
if
he
had
not
used
his
brain
and
muscles
to
take
some
stone
or
a
piece
of
wood
to
knock
down
fruit
from
trees
to
kill
an
animal
so
as
to
use
his
hide
for
clothes
and
his
meat
for
food
or
to
break
wood
and
trees
for
a
shelter
and
to
make
some
weapons
for
defense
and
hunting
in
the
first
stone
which
he
the
savage
flings
at
the
wild
animal
he
pursues
in
the
first
stick
that
he
seizes
to
strike
down
the
fruit
which
hangs
above
his
reach
we
see
the
appropriation
of
one
article
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
in
the
acquisition
of
another
and
thus
we
discover
the
origin
of
torrens
essay
on
the
production
of
our
primitive
forefather
s
first
acquaintance
with
fire
was
probably
through
lightning
he
discovered
probably
by
chance
the
possibility
of
making
fire
by
rubbing
together
two
pieces
of
wood
and
by
striking
together
two
pieces
of
stone
he
established
one
of
the
first
facts
in
technology
he
felt
the
warm
effect
of
fire
and
also
the
good
effect
of
broiling
his
food
by
finding
some
roasted
animals
in
a
fire
thus
nature
revealed
to
him
one
of
its
great
gifts
the
energy
of
the
sun
in
vegetation
and
its
primitive
beneficial
use
he
was
already
a
being
evolution
had
brought
him
to
that
level
being
a
product
of
nature
he
was
reflecting
those
natural
laws
that
belong
to
his
class
of
life
he
had
ceased
to
be
had
become
had
got
into
his
was
above
the
estate
of
animals
we
also
observe
that
primitive
man
produced
commodities
acquired
experiences
made
observations
and
that
some
of
the
produced
commodities
had
a
for
other
people
and
remained
good
for
use
even
after
his
death
the
produced
commodities
were
composed
of
raw
material
freely
supplied
by
nature
combined
with
some
mental
work
which
gave
him
the
conception
of
how
to
make
and
to
use
the
object
and
some
work
on
his
part
which
finally
shaped
the
thing
all
of
this
mental
and
manual
work
consumed
an
amount
of
time
it
is
obvious
that
all
of
these
elements
are
indispensable
to
produce
anything
of
any
value
or
of
any
his
child
not
only
directly
received
some
of
the
produced
by
him
but
was
initiated
into
all
of
his
experiences
and
observations
as
we
know
power
as
defined
in
mechanics
means
the
ratio
of
work
done
to
the
time
used
in
doing
it
all
those
things
are
phenomena
produced
by
the
capacity
of
man
but
man
has
known
that
was
his
we
must
notice
the
strange
fact
that
from
the
engineering
point
of
view
humanity
though
very
developed
in
some
ways
is
childishly
undeveloped
in
others
humanity
has
some
conceptions
about
dimensions
and
talks
of
the
world
in
which
we
live
as
having
three
dimensions
yet
even
in
its
wildest
imagination
it
can
not
picture
tangibly
a
dimension
nay
humanity
has
not
learned
to
grasp
the
real
meanings
of
things
that
are
basic
or
fundamental
all
of
our
conceptions
are
relative
and
comparative
all
of
them
are
based
upon
matters
which
we
do
not
yet
understand
for
example
we
talk
of
time
space
electricity
gravity
and
so
on
but
no
one
has
been
able
to
define
them
in
terms
of
the
data
of
sensation
it
is
a
fact
of
the
greatest
learn
how
to
use
many
things
which
we
do
not
fully
understand
and
are
not
yet
able
to
define
in
political
economy
the
meagreness
of
our
understanding
is
especially
remarkable
we
have
not
yet
grasped
the
obvious
fact
of
immeasurable
import
for
all
of
the
social
with
little
exception
the
wealth
and
capital
possessed
by
a
given
generation
are
not
produced
by
its
own
toil
but
are
the
inherited
fruit
of
dead
men
s
free
gift
of
the
past
we
have
yet
to
learn
and
apply
the
lesson
that
not
only
our
material
wealth
and
capital
but
our
science
and
art
and
learning
and
that
goes
to
constitute
our
produced
not
by
our
own
labor
but
by
the
energies
of
past
generations
primitive
man
used
natural
laws
without
knowing
them
or
understanding
them
but
he
was
able
to
cause
nature
to
express
itself
by
finding
a
way
to
release
nature
s
stored
up
energy
through
the
work
of
his
brain
and
its
direction
in
the
use
of
his
muscles
he
found
that
some
of
his
appliances
were
not
good
he
made
better
ones
and
thus
slowly
at
first
the
progress
of
humanity
went
on
i
will
not
enlarge
upon
the
history
of
the
evolution
of
civilization
because
it
is
told
in
many
books
in
the
earliest
times
the
religious
philosophical
legal
and
ethical
systems
had
not
been
invented
the
morale
at
that
time
was
a
natural
morale
humans
knew
that
they
did
not
create
nature
they
did
not
feel
it
proper
to
expropriate
the
creator
and
legalistically
appropriate
the
earth
and
its
treasure
for
themselves
they
felt
in
their
unsophisticated
morale
that
being
called
into
existence
they
had
a
natural
right
to
exist
and
to
use
freely
the
gifts
of
nature
in
the
preservation
of
their
life
and
that
is
what
they
did
after
the
death
of
a
man
some
of
the
objects
produced
by
him
still
survived
such
as
weapons
fishing
or
hunting
instruments
or
the
caves
adapted
for
living
a
baby
had
to
be
nourished
for
some
years
by
its
parents
or
it
would
have
died
those
facts
had
important
consequences
objects
made
by
someone
for
some
particular
use
could
be
used
by
someone
else
even
after
the
death
of
one
or
more
successive
users
again
the
experiences
acquired
by
one
member
of
a
family
or
a
group
of
people
were
taught
by
example
or
precept
to
others
of
the
same
generation
and
to
the
next
generation
such
simple
facts
are
the
corner
stones
of
our
whole
civilization
and
they
are
the
direct
result
of
the
human
capacity
of
the
world
is
full
of
controversy
about
wealth
capital
and
money
and
because
humanity
through
its
peculiar
power
binds
this
element
time
in
an
ever
larger
and
larger
degree
the
controversy
becomes
more
and
more
acute
civilization
as
a
process
is
the
process
of
binding
time
progress
is
made
by
the
fact
that
each
generation
adds
to
the
material
and
spiritual
wealth
which
it
inherits
past
fruit
of
bygone
live
in
the
present
are
augmented
in
the
present
and
transmitted
to
the
future
the
process
goes
on
time
the
essential
element
is
so
involved
that
though
it
increases
arithmetically
its
fruit
civilization
advances
geometrically
but
there
is
another
peculiarity
in
wealth
and
money
if
a
wooden
or
iron
inch
be
allowed
to
rot
or
rust
quietly
on
some
shelf
this
inch
does
not
represent
anything
besides
this
piece
of
wood
or
iron
but
if
we
take
the
mental
value
of
an
inch
this
unit
of
one
of
the
measures
of
space
and
use
it
with
other
quantities
in
the
contemplation
of
the
skies
for
the
solving
of
an
astronomical
problem
it
gives
a
prophetic
answer
that
in
a
certain
place
there
is
a
star
this
star
may
be
for
years
looked
for
in
vain
was
it
that
the
calculation
was
wrong
no
for
after
further
search
with
telescopes
of
greater
power
the
star
is
found
and
the
calculation
thus
verified
it
is
obvious
that
the
unit
no
value
by
itself
but
is
very
precious
as
a
unit
for
measuring
the
phenomenon
of
length
which
it
perfectly
represents
and
that
is
why
it
was
introduced
it
is
exactly
the
same
with
money
if
the
term
be
rightly
understood
understood
aright
money
being
the
measure
and
representative
of
wealth
is
in
the
main
the
measure
and
the
representative
of
dead
men
s
toil
for
rightly
understood
wealth
is
almost
entirely
the
product
of
the
labor
of
generations
this
product
we
have
seen
involves
the
element
of
time
as
the
chief
factor
and
so
we
discover
how
money
properly
understood
is
connected
with
main
function
of
money
is
to
measure
and
represent
the
accumulated
products
of
the
labor
of
past
generations
hoarded
money
is
like
an
iron
inch
upon
a
useless
lump
but
when
used
as
a
measure
and
representative
of
wealth
rightly
understood
money
renders
invaluable
service
for
it
then
serves
to
measure
and
represent
the
living
fruit
of
dead
men
s
toil
for
this
reason
it
is
useless
to
argue
who
is
the
more
important
the
capitalist
who
has
legal
possession
of
most
of
the
material
fruit
of
dead
men
s
toil
or
the
laborer
who
has
legal
possession
of
but
little
of
it
in
the
laborer
we
do
not
now
really
look
for
his
physical
muscular
labor
alone
for
this
is
replaced
by
mechanical
or
animal
power
as
soon
as
it
can
be
what
we
do
need
from
labor
and
what
we
will
always
need
is
his
power
the
population
of
the
world
may
be
divided
into
different
classes
if
the
classes
are
not
here
enumerated
in
the
customary
way
it
is
because
it
is
necessary
to
classify
human
beings
as
nearly
as
possible
according
to
their
there
is
no
assertion
that
this
is
an
ideal
classification
but
if
someone
is
moved
to
what
a
foolish
unscientific
division
will
answer
by
saying
i
grant
that
the
division
is
foolish
and
unscientific
but
it
is
the
only
division
which
corresponds
to
facts
in
life
and
it
is
not
the
writer
s
fault
by
this
foolishness
some
good
may
be
from
an
engineer
s
point
of
view
humanity
is
apparently
to
be
divided
into
three
classes
the
intellectuals
the
rich
and
the
poor
this
division
would
seem
to
be
contrary
to
all
the
rules
of
logic
but
it
corresponds
to
facts
of
course
some
individuals
belong
to
two
of
the
classes
or
even
to
all
three
of
them
an
product
but
essentially
they
belong
to
the
one
class
in
proportion
to
the
characteristic
which
is
the
most
marked
in
their
life
that
is
in
the
sense
of
social
on
magnitude
of
values
the
intellectuals
are
the
men
and
women
who
possess
the
knowledge
produced
by
the
labor
of
generations
but
do
not
possess
the
material
wealth
thus
produced
in
mastering
and
using
this
inheritance
of
knowledge
they
are
exercising
their
energies
and
making
the
labor
of
the
dead
live
in
the
present
and
for
the
future
the
rich
are
those
who
have
possession
and
control
of
most
of
the
wealth
produced
by
the
toil
of
bygone
that
is
dead
unless
animated
and
transformed
by
the
labor
of
the
living
the
poor
are
those
who
have
neither
the
knowledge
possessed
by
the
intellectuals
nor
the
material
wealth
possessed
by
the
rich
and
who
moreover
because
nearly
all
their
efforts
under
present
conditions
are
limited
to
the
struggle
for
mere
existence
have
little
or
no
opportunity
to
exercise
their
capacity
let
us
now
try
to
ascertain
the
rôle
of
the
class
of
life
as
a
whole
we
have
by
necessity
to
go
back
to
the
to
the
savage
we
have
seen
what
were
the
conditions
of
his
work
and
progress
we
saw
that
for
each
successful
achievement
he
often
had
to
wrestle
with
a
very
large
number
of
unsuccessful
achievements
and
his
lifetime
being
so
limited
the
total
of
his
successful
achievements
was
very
limited
so
that
he
was
able
to
give
to
his
child
only
a
few
useful
objects
and
the
sum
of
his
experience
generally
speaking
each
successor
did
not
start
his
life
at
the
point
where
his
father
started
he
started
somewhere
near
where
his
father
left
off
his
father
gave
say
fifty
years
to
discover
two
truths
in
nature
and
succeeded
in
making
two
or
three
simple
objects
but
the
son
does
not
need
to
give
fifty
years
to
discover
and
create
the
same
achievements
and
so
he
has
time
to
achieve
something
he
thus
adds
his
own
achievements
to
those
of
his
father
in
tools
and
experience
this
is
the
mathematical
equivalent
of
adding
his
parent
s
years
of
life
to
his
own
his
mother
s
work
and
experience
are
of
course
name
father
and
son
being
only
used
representatively
this
stupendous
fact
is
the
definitive
mark
of
power
to
roll
up
continuously
the
achievements
of
generation
after
generation
endlessly
we
have
seen
that
this
power
is
an
exponential
power
or
function
of
time
time
flows
on
increasing
in
arithmetical
progression
adding
generation
unto
generation
but
the
results
of
human
energies
working
in
time
do
not
go
on
arithmetically
they
pile
up
or
roll
up
more
and
more
rapidly
augmenting
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
a
more
and
more
rapidly
increasing
geometric
progression
the
typical
term
of
the
progression
is
where
denotes
the
ending
progress
made
in
the
generation
with
which
we
agree
to
start
our
reckoning
denotes
the
ratio
increase
and
denotes
the
number
of
generations
after
the
chosen
the
quantity
of
progress
made
in
the
generation
contains
as
an
exponent
and
so
the
quantity
varying
as
time
passes
is
called
an
exponential
function
of
the
time
nature
is
the
source
of
all
energy
plants
the
lowest
form
of
life
have
a
definite
rôle
to
perform
in
the
economy
of
nature
their
function
is
the
forming
of
albuminoids
and
other
substances
for
higher
purposes
all
of
their
nitrates
are
or
low
explosives
but
explosives
anyway
they
are
powerful
sources
of
some
new
energy
animal
life
uses
these
explosives
as
food
and
is
correspondingly
more
dynamic
but
in
animal
life
time
does
not
play
the
rôle
it
plays
in
human
life
animals
are
limited
by
death
permanently
if
animals
make
any
progress
from
generation
to
generation
it
is
so
small
as
to
be
negligible
a
beaver
for
example
is
a
remarkable
builder
of
dams
but
he
does
not
progress
in
the
way
of
inventions
or
further
development
a
beaver
dam
is
always
a
beaver
dam
finally
humanity
the
highest
known
class
of
life
has
capacity
as
its
characteristic
its
discriminant
its
peculiar
and
definitive
mark
it
is
an
unrealized
fact
that
in
this
higher
class
of
life
law
of
organic
growth
develops
into
the
law
of
increasing
exponential
function
of
that
fact
is
of
basic
importance
for
the
science
and
art
of
human
engineering
in
mechanics
we
have
the
formula
work
time
power
we
have
seen
that
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
geometric
progression
represents
the
progress
work
the
generation
being
counted
from
some
generation
taken
as
starting
point
of
reckoning
this
progress
achievement
or
being
done
in
generation
we
have
by
work
prt
time
power
that
is
power
this
means
that
the
number
which
measures
the
work
done
in
a
given
generation
is
also
the
measure
of
the
power
that
does
the
work
now
the
total
work
done
in
the
generations
is
that
is
it
should
be
noticed
that
by
this
expression
for
may
also
be
regarded
as
the
sum
of
different
powers
each
working
during
one
and
only
one
generation
if
we
divided
this
sum
by
the
quotient
would
be
a
power
that
would
have
to
act
through
generations
to
produce
the
reader
should
not
fail
to
notice
very
carefully
that
the
expression
for
is
an
expression
for
the
total
progress
total
work
total
wealth
the
course
of
generations
and
he
should
especially
note
how
the
expression
involves
the
exponential
function
of
time
namely
the
formula
makes
mathematically
evident
the
capacity
characteristic
of
the
human
class
of
life
properly
understood
consists
of
the
fruits
or
products
of
this
capacity
of
man
animals
do
not
produce
wealth
it
is
produced
by
man
and
only
man
the
foregoing
basic
formulation
should
lead
to
further
similar
developments
throwing
much
light
upon
the
process
of
civilization
and
serving
to
eliminate
private
opinion
from
the
conduct
of
human
affairs
in
this
writing
it
is
not
important
to
look
deeper
into
these
proposed
series
the
fact
remains
that
as
well
as
are
peculiarly
increasing
series
of
a
geometrical
precise
form
will
be
developed
in
another
writing
human
achievements
and
progress
because
cumulative
are
knocking
out
the
barriers
of
time
this
fact
is
the
vital
and
dynamic
difference
between
animal
life
and
human
life
as
plants
gather
in
and
store
up
solar
energy
into
sheaves
for
the
use
and
growth
of
animal
and
humans
are
gathering
and
binding
the
knowledge
of
past
centuries
into
sheaves
for
the
use
and
development
of
generations
yet
unborn
we
have
seen
that
the
term
wealth
rightly
understood
means
the
fruit
of
the
work
of
humanity
wealth
is
of
two
kinds
one
is
material
the
other
is
knowledge
both
kinds
have
the
first
kind
commodities
composing
it
deteriorate
and
become
useless
the
other
is
permanent
in
character
it
is
imperishable
it
may
be
lost
or
forgotten
but
it
does
not
wear
out
the
one
is
limited
in
time
the
other
unlimited
in
time
the
former
i
call
potential
the
latter
kinetic
analysis
will
justify
the
names
the
energy
of
a
body
which
is
due
to
its
position
is
called
potential
energy
the
energy
of
a
body
which
is
due
to
its
motion
is
called
kinetic
energy
here
the
material
has
value
through
its
position
shape
and
so
forth
it
is
immobile
if
not
used
and
has
not
the
capacity
to
progress
mental
are
not
static
but
permanently
dynamic
one
thought
one
discovery
is
the
impulse
to
others
they
follow
the
law
of
an
increasing
function
of
time
see
app
ii
this
is
why
these
names
correspond
to
the
two
names
of
the
two
mentioned
classes
of
energy
here
i
must
return
to
the
current
conceptions
of
wealth
and
capital
before
cited
wealth
we
are
told
is
any
useful
or
agreeable
thing
which
possesses
and
we
are
told
that
capital
is
that
part
of
wealth
which
is
devoted
to
obtaining
further
i
have
said
that
such
wealth
and
capital
are
belong
to
the
period
of
humanity
s
childhood
that
they
are
indeed
childish
conceptions
the
reader
can
not
fail
to
see
if
he
will
reflect
upon
them
and
especially
if
he
will
compare
them
with
the
scientific
conception
according
to
which
wealth
consists
of
those
they
be
material
commodities
or
forms
of
knowledge
and
have
been
produced
by
the
energies
of
humanity
and
according
to
which
all
the
wealth
of
the
world
at
any
given
is
the
fruit
of
the
toil
of
past
living
work
of
the
dead
it
seems
unnecessary
to
warn
the
reader
against
confusing
the
of
money
by
hook
or
crook
by
trick
or
trade
with
the
of
wealth
by
the
product
of
labor
in
calling
the
old
conceptions
childish
i
do
not
mean
that
they
contain
no
element
of
truth
whatever
i
mean
that
they
are
shallow
scientifically
or
spiritually
meagre
narrow
in
their
vision
wrong
in
their
accent
i
especially
mean
that
they
are
dumb
because
they
are
blind
regarding
the
central
matter
that
wealth
is
the
natural
offspring
of
time
and
human
toil
the
old
conceptions
do
indeed
imply
that
wealth
and
capital
involve
both
potential
and
kinetic
and
in
so
far
they
are
right
but
how
do
such
arise
the
potential
in
wealth
are
created
by
human
work
operating
in
time
upon
raw
material
given
by
nature
the
are
produced
by
transformations
of
the
raw
materials
these
transformations
are
wrought
by
human
brain
labor
and
human
muscular
labor
directed
by
the
human
brain
acting
in
time
the
kinetic
of
wealth
are
also
created
by
human
by
the
intellectual
labor
of
observation
experimentation
imagination
deduction
and
invention
all
consuming
the
precious
time
of
short
human
lives
it
is
obvious
that
in
the
creation
of
whether
potential
or
kinetic
the
element
of
enters
as
an
absolutely
essential
factor
the
fundamental
importance
of
time
as
a
factor
in
the
production
of
fact
that
wealth
and
the
of
wealth
are
literally
the
natural
offspring
of
the
spiritual
union
of
time
with
been
completely
overlooked
not
only
by
the
economics
but
by
the
ethics
the
jurisprudence
and
the
other
branches
of
speculative
reasoning
throughout
the
long
period
of
humanity
s
childhood
in
the
course
of
the
ages
there
has
indeed
been
much
talk
about
time
but
there
has
been
no
recognition
of
the
basic
significance
of
time
as
essential
in
the
conception
and
in
the
very
constitution
of
human
values
it
is
often
said
that
time
is
money
the
statement
is
often
false
but
the
proposition
that
money
is
time
is
always
true
it
is
always
true
in
the
profound
sense
that
money
is
the
measure
and
symbol
of
product
of
time
and
crystallization
of
the
human
capacity
it
is
thus
true
that
money
is
a
very
precious
thing
the
measure
and
symbol
of
part
the
work
of
the
living
but
in
the
main
the
living
work
of
the
dead
nature
s
laws
are
supreme
we
can
not
change
them
we
can
deviate
from
them
for
a
while
but
the
end
is
evil
that
is
the
lesson
we
must
learn
from
the
history
of
humanity
s
childhood
false
conceptions
of
of
the
laws
of
human
given
us
unscientific
economies
unscientific
ethics
unscientific
law
unscientific
politics
unscientific
government
these
have
made
human
history
the
history
of
social
wars
tokens
not
so
much
of
human
lust
as
of
human
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
human
nature
there
is
but
one
remedy
one
science
and
art
of
human
engineering
based
upon
the
just
conception
of
humanity
as
the
class
of
life
and
conforming
to
the
laws
of
nature
including
the
laws
of
human
nature
chapter

capitalistic
era
the
immortal
work
done
by
descartes
newton
and
leibnitz
was
to
discover
powerful
methods
for
only
fit
language
for
expressing
the
laws
of
nature
human
engineering
will
be
the
science
by
which
the
great
social
problems
will
be
solved
for
the
first
time
since
the
first
day
of
man
humanity
will
really
understand
its
own
nature
and
status
and
will
learn
to
direct
scientifically
the
living
and
the
forces
for
construction
avoiding
unnecessary
destruction
and
waste
it
may
seem
strange
but
it
is
true
that
the
exponential
powers
called
humans
do
not
bodies
die
but
their
achievements
live
permanent
source
of
power
all
of
our
precious
acquired
by
experience
accumulated
wealth
in
all
fields
of
kinetic
and
potential
created
and
left
by
generations
they
are
humanity
s
treasures
produced
mainly
in
the
past
and
conserved
for
our
use
by
that
peculiar
function
or
power
of
man
for
the
binding
of
time
that
the
natural
trend
of
life
and
the
progress
of
the
development
of
this
treasury
is
so
often
checked
turned
from
its
natural
course
or
set
back
is
due
to
ignorance
of
human
nature
to
metaphysical
speculation
and
sophistry
those
who
with
or
without
intention
keep
the
rate
of
humanity
s
mental
advancement
down
to
that
of
an
arithmetic
progression
are
the
real
enemies
of
society
for
they
keep
the
sciences
and
institutions
far
behind
the
gallop
of
life
itself
the
consequence
is
periodic
social
and
revolutions
let
us
carry
the
analysis
of
potential
and
kinetic
a
little
further
all
potential
left
to
us
by
the
dead
are
temporal
and
differ
in
utility
many
potential
are
found
in
museums
and
have
very
limited
value
in
practical
life
on
the
other
hand
some
roads
or
built
by
the
ancients
have
and
an
almost
endless
list
of
modern
potential
have
or
will
have
for
a
long
time
to
come
such
as
buildings
improved
lands
railroad
tracks
certain
machines
or
tools
the
of
some
such
items
of
material
wealth
will
last
for
more
than
one
generation
kinetic
are
permanent
in
their
character
for
though
they
may
become
antiquated
they
yet
serve
as
the
foundation
for
the
developments
that
supersede
them
and
so
they
continue
to
live
in
that
to
which
they
lead
i
would
draw
attention
at
this
point
to
one
of
the
most
important
kinetic
and
potential
produced
by
invention
of
the
steam
engine
through
this
invention
humanity
has
been
able
to
avail
itself
not
only
of
the
living
fruits
of
dead
men
s
toil
but
also
of
the
inconceivably
vast
amounts
of
solar
energy
and
time
bound
up
in
the
growth
of
vegetable
life
and
conserved
for
use
in
the
form
of
coal
and
other
fuels
of
vegetable
origin
this
invention
has
revolutionized
our
life
in
countless
directions
to
be
brief
i
will
analyse
only
the
most
salient
effects
human
engineering
has
never
existed
except
in
the
most
embryonic
form
in
remote
antiquity
the
conception
and
knowledge
of
natural
law
was
wholly
absent
or
exceedingly
vague
before
the
invention
of
the
steam
engine
people
depended
mainly
upon
human
is
upon
living
powers
powers
of
living
men
and
the
living
fruits
of
the
labor
of
the
dead
even
then
there
were
manifold
complications
the
invention
of
the
steam
engine
released
for
human
use
a
new
power
of
tremendous
power
of
solar
energy
and
ages
of
time
but
we
must
not
fail
to
note
carefully
that
we
are
enabled
to
use
this
immense
new
power
of
solar
energy
and
time
by
a
human
invention
a
product
of
the
dead
the
full
significance
of
the
last
statement
requires
reflection
the
now
dead
inventor
of
the
steam
engine
could
not
have
produced
his
ingenious
invention
except
by
using
the
living
powers
of
other
dead
by
using
the
material
and
spiritual
or
mental
wealth
created
by
those
who
had
gone
before
in
the
inventor
s
intellectual
equipment
there
was
actively
present
the
kinetic
of
enabling
him
to
discover
the
laws
of
heat
water
and
steam
and
he
employed
both
the
potential
and
kinetic
of
mechanical
instruments
methods
of
work
and
scientific
knowledge
of
his
time
and
of
wealth
created
by
the
genius
and
toil
of
generations
this
invention
was
not
produced
let
us
say
years
ago
because
civilization
was
not
then
sufficiently
advanced
mathematically
considered
the
production
of
this
great
had
to
await
all
the
accumulated
work
of
six
thousand
years
of
human
ingenuity
and
human
labor
so
if
we
choose
the
steam
engine
may
be
considered
a
kinetic
in
which
the
factor
of
time
is
equal
to
something
like
years
or
let
us
say
roughly
generations
it
is
obvious
that
in
one
life
time
even
a
genius
of
the
highest
order
could
not
in
aboriginal
conditions
have
invented
and
built
a
steam
engine
when
everything
even
iron
was
unknown
of
course
if
the
same
inventor
could
have
had
a
life
of
several
thousands
of
years
and
could
have
consecutively
followed
up
all
the
processes
unhampered
by
the
prejudices
of
those
days
and
been
able
to
make
all
of
these
inventions
by
himself
he
would
represent
in
himself
all
the
progress
of
civilization
by
this
illustration
we
see
the
profound
meaning
of
the
living
powers
of
the
dead
we
see
the
grave
importance
in
human
life
of
the
factor
time
we
behold
the
significance
of
the
capacity
of
man
the
steam
engine
is
to
be
seen
anew
as
in
the
main
the
accumulated
production
of
s
work
the
life
of
one
generation
is
short
and
were
it
not
for
our
human
capacity
to
inherit
the
material
and
spiritual
fruit
of
dead
men
s
toil
to
augment
it
a
little
in
the
brief
span
of
our
own
lives
and
to
transmit
it
to
posterity
the
process
of
civilization
would
not
be
possible
and
our
present
estate
would
be
that
of
aboriginal
man
civilization
is
a
creature
its
creator
is
the
power
of
man
animals
have
it
not
because
they
belong
to
a
lower
type
or
dimension
of
life
sophistry
avails
nothing
here
a
child
left
in
the
woods
would
be
and
remain
a
savage
matching
his
wits
with
gorillas
he
becomes
a
civilized
man
only
by
the
accumulation
of
and
acquaintance
with
dead
men
s
work
for
then
and
only
then
can
he
start
where
the
preceding
generation
left
off
this
capacity
is
peculiar
to
men
the
fact
can
not
be
repeated
too
often
it
is
untrue
to
say
that
started
his
life
aided
exclusively
by
the
achievements
of
say
his
father
for
his
father
s
achievements
depended
on
the
achievements
of
immediate
predecessors
and
so
on
all
the
way
back
through
the
life
of
humanity
this
fact
of
supreme
ethical
importance
applies
to
of
us
none
of
us
may
speak
or
act
as
if
the
material
or
spiritual
wealth
we
have
were
produced
by
us
for
if
we
be
not
stupid
we
must
see
that
what
we
call
wealth
civilization
everything
we
use
or
enjoy
is
in
the
main
the
product
of
the
labor
of
men
now
dead
some
of
them
slaves
some
of
them
owners
of
slaves
the
metal
spoon
or
the
knife
which
we
use
daily
is
a
product
of
the
work
of
many
generations
including
those
who
discovered
the
metal
and
the
use
of
it
and
the
utility
of
the
spoon
and
here
arises
a
most
important
question
since
the
wealth
of
the
world
is
in
the
main
the
free
gift
of
the
fruit
of
the
labor
of
the
whom
does
it
of
right
belong
the
question
can
not
be
evaded
is
the
existing
monopoly
of
the
great
inherited
treasures
produced
by
dead
men
s
toil
a
normal
and
natural
evolution
or
is
it
an
artificial
status
imposed
by
the
few
upon
the
many
such
is
the
crux
of
the
modern
controversy
it
is
generally
known
that
the
invention
of
the
steam
engine
and
other
combustion
engines
which
release
for
mechanical
use
has
revolutionized
the
economic
system
for
the
building
of
engines
in
the
scale
of
modern
needs
it
is
necessary
to
concentrate
a
great
number
of
living
men
in
one
place
to
build
factories
to
set
up
machines
used
in
producing
the
engines
and
all
this
requires
the
use
of
vast
amounts
of
money
that
is
why
this
era
is
called
the
capitalistic
era
but
it
is
necessary
to
stop
here
and
analyse
the
factors
of
value
in
the
engine
to
be
made
and
in
the
money
used
for
the
purpose
of
making
use
of
the
energies
of
the
sun
we
have
found
that
the
major
part
of
the
engine
and
all
factors
connected
with
its
production
are
the
combined
power
of
dead
men
s
labor
we
have
found
that
wealth
or
capital
and
its
symbol
money
are
also
in
the
main
the
power
of
dead
men
s
labor
so
that
the
only
way
to
obtain
the
benefit
in
the
release
of
is
by
using
the
product
of
the
toil
of
the
dead
it
is
further
obvious
that
only
the
men
or
organizations
that
are
able
to
concentrate
the
largest
amounts
of
money
representing
the
work
of
the
dead
can
have
the
fullest
use
of
the
energies
of
time
and
the
ancient
sun
thus
the
monopoly
of
the
energies
of
the
sun
arises
from
monopolizing
the
accumulated
fruits
of
dead
men
s
toil
these
problems
will
in
the
future
be
the
concern
of
the
science
and
art
of
human
engineering
let
us
glance
briefly
at
the
problems
from
another
angle
the
power
developed
in
the
combustion
of
one
pound
of
coal
is
theoretically
equal
to
foot
pounds
but
by
our
imperfect
methods
of
utilization
not
more
than
foot
pounds
are
made
available
this
is
about
the
amount
of
physical
power
exerted
by
a
man
of
ordinary
strength
during
a
day
s
work
hence
pounds
of
coal
will
represent
the
labor
of
a
man
for
a
year
the
current
production
of
coal
in
the
world
is
about
tons
if
we
suppose
that
only
half
of
this
coal
goes
for
mechanical
use
this
will
give
us
approximately
the
number
as
that
are
producers
but
not
consumers
let
us
take
a
still
broader
view
of
resources
we
have
approximately
living
human
beings
all
censuses
available
between
and
a
wealth
of
approximately
page
which
in
our
analysis
is
dead
men
s
work
and
equal
in
work
to
the
work
of
our
whole
living
population
or
equal
to
sun
taking
for
simplicity
s
sake
as
the
average
living
expenses
per
annum
for
each
one
of
the
population
we
will
have
living
men
living
of
the
dead
sun
such
classification
needs
a
reflection
man
is
intrinsically
an
increasing
exponential
power
and
always
produces
two
potential
and
the
kinetic
all
living
men
have
in
some
degree
this
type
of
power
are
able
to
direct
and
use
basic
so
we
see
that
this
world
is
really
populated
by
three
different
populations
all
of
them
dynamic
and
active
to
wit
living
men
living
of
the
dead
sun
thus
it
is
obvious
beyond
any
argument
this
additional
producing
but
not
population
has
been
produced
mainly
by
the
work
of
all
our
past
generations
it
is
said
mainly
because
if
we
were
the
first
generation
we
would
be
just
aboriginal
savages
having
nothing
and
progressing
very
slowly
the
reason
why
we
progress
very
rapidly
in
this
stage
of
civilization
is
explained
very
clearly
by
the
mathematical
law
of
a
geometrical
progression
with
an
ever
increasing
number
of
terms
the
magnitude
of
the
terms
increasing
more
rapidly
all
the
time
this
fact
is
the
reason
why
the
old
unscientific
and
artificial
social
system
requires
and
must
undergo
profound
transformation
human
progress
in
many
directions
is
so
far
advanced
that
social
institutions
can
not
much
longer
continue
to
lag
so
far
behind
static
ethics
static
jurisprudence
static
economics
and
the
rest
must
become
dynamic
if
they
do
not
continue
to
progress
peacefully
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
progress
of
science
they
will
be
forced
by
violent
readjustments
recurring
with
ever
increasing
frequency
here
we
have
a
problem
of
very
high
importance
and
enormous
magnitude
to
serve
living
men
we
have
dead
and
all
the
sun
servants
to
each
living
man
woman
and
child
included
it
looks
like
the
millennium
it
would
be
so
if
we
but
used
all
this
power
in
a
constructive
way
eliminating
waste
and
controversy
and
all
those
factors
which
hamper
production
and
progress
the
present
economic
system
does
not
realize
even
the
beginning
of
the
magnitude
of
this
truth
and
the
tremendous
results
which
are
to
be
achieved
through
the
adjustment
of
it
the
problem
will
be
solved
by
human
engineering
for
this
will
establish
the
right
understanding
of
values
and
will
show
how
to
manage
world
problems
scientifically
it
will
give
a
scientific
foundation
to
political

and
transform
scientific
shop
management
into
genuine
scientific
world
there
is
a
chasm
between
capital
and
labor
but
nature
does
not
know
capital
or
labor
at
all
nature
knows
only
matter
energy
space
time
potential
and
kinetic
forces
in
all
their
direct
and
indirect
expression
the
energies
of
living

living

of

and
the
powers
of

and
the
ancient

nature

an
increasing
exponential
function
of

a
a
power
able
to
transform
and
direct
basic
powers
sometimes
we
hypocritically
like
to
delude
ourselves
if
our
delusions
are
profitable
we
call
human
work
manual
labor
and
we
pretend
that
we
need
the
laborer
for
his
muscular
service
but
when
we
thus
speak
we
are
thoughtless
stupid
or
insincere
what
we
look
for
in
the
worker
is
his
of
his
muscles
mechanical
work
is
or
can
be
replaced
almost
entirely
by
machinery
what
we
will
never
be
able
to
replace
by
machinery
is
a
man
because
man
belongs
to
the
level
of
a
dimension
above
machinery
sun
and
the
work
of
the
inanimate
they
become
productive
only
when
quickened
by
the
energies
of
living
men
and
women
then
only
are
the
results
proportional
to
the
ever
growing
magnitude
of
exponential
power
in
nature
s
economy
the
are
the
intelligent
forces
there
is
none
else
known
to
us
and
from
the
engineer
s
point
of
view
edison
and
the
simplest
laborer
smith
or
jones
are
basically
the
same
their
powers
or
capacities
are
exponential
and
though
differing
in
degree
are
the
same
in
kind
this
may
seem
optimistic
but
all
engineers
are
optimists
they
deal
only
with
fact
and
truth
if
they
make
mistakes
if
their
bridges
break
down
then
no
matter
how
clever
their
sophistry
they
are
adjudged
criminal
like
severity
must
be
made
the
rule
and
practice
toward
all
those
who
control
the
institutions
and
great
affairs
of
human
society
periodical
must
be
prevented
the
engineers
of
human
society
must
be
held
responsible
as
the
bridge
engineer
is
held
things
are
often
simpler
than
they
appear
at
the
first
glance
there
may
be
fire
and
plenty
of
coal
in
a
stove
yet
no
heat
the
fire
does
not
burn
well
an
engineer
will
remove
the
natural
causes
of
obstruction
of
the
natural
process
even
such
a
simple
thing
as
the
removal
of
ashes
may
solve
the
problem
it
seems
simple
enough
the
truth
is
often
clear
and
simple
if
only
it
be
not
obscured
and
complicated
by
sophistry
capitalistic
reasoning
and
socialistic
does
not
know
such
things
nature
has
only
one
reasoning
in
all
its
functions
our
falsifying
of
nature
s
laws
makes
the
controversy
socialism
exists
as
an
because
capitalism
exists
as
an
the
clash
is
only
an
expression
of
the
eternal
law
of
action
and
reaction
we
are
living
in
a
world
of
wealth
a
world
enriched
by
many
generations
of
dead
men
s
toil
between
the
lust
of
the
one
to
and
the
lust
of
others
to
there
is
little
to
choose
such
contentions
of
lust
against
lust
are
such
ethics
is
zoological
righteousness
of
tooth
and
claw
below
the
human
dimensions
of
life
utterly
unworthy
of
the
creative
humanity
socialism
feels
keenly
and
sees
dimly
that
human
affairs
are
not
conducted
in
conformity
with
natural
laws
capitalism
neither
sees
it
nor
keenly
feels
it
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
stops
to
investigate
natural
s
of
human
they
both
of
them
use
the
same
speculative
methods
in
their
arguments
and
there
can
be
no
issue
against
one
speculative
argument
there
is
always
a
speculative
answer
they
both
speak
about
the
truth
but
their
methods
can
not
find
the
truth
nor
their
language
express
it
they
speak
of
justice
right
and
so
forth
not
knowing
that
their
conceptions
of
those
terms
are
based
on
a
wrong
understanding
of
values
there
is
one
and
but
one
remedy
and
that
remedy
consists
in
applying
scientific
method
to
the
study
of
the
subject
sound
reasoning
once
introduced
will
overrun
humanity
as
the
fields
turn
green
in
the
spring
it
will
eliminate
the
waste
of
energy
in
controversies
it
will
attract
all
forces
toward
construction
and
the
exploitation
of
nature
for
the
common
weal
there
are
capitalists
and
capitalists
there
are
socialists
and
socialists
among
the
capitalists
there
are
those
who
want
the
fruit
of
dead
men
s
themselves
among
the
socialists
there
are
orthodox
seek
to
disperse
it
the
former
do
not
perceive
that
the
product
of
the
labor
of
the
dead
is
itself
dead
if
not
quickened
by
the
energies
of
living
men
the
orthodox
socialists
do
not
perceive
the
tremendous
benefits
that
accrue
to
mankind
from
the
accumulation
of
wealth
if
whether
we
be
capitalists
or
socialists
or
neither
we
must
learn
that
to
prey
upon
the
treasury
left
by
the
dead
is
to
live
not
the
life
of
a
human
being
but
that
of
a
legalistic
not
alter
the
fact
neither
does
lust
for
the
same
when
we
have
acquired
the
just
conception
of
what
a
human
being
is
we
shall
get
away
from
the
roman
conception
according
to
which
a
human
being
is
an
animal
and
a
tool
to
regard
human
beings
as
the
use
of
other
human
beings
is
not
only
unscientific
but
it
is
repugnant
stupid
and
short
sighted
tools
are
made
by
man
but
have
not
the
autonomy
of
their
have
not
man
s
capacity
for
initiation
for
and
in
their
own
nature
tools
instruments
machines
belong
to
a
dimension
far
lower
than
that
of
man
talk
of
dimensions
or
dimensionality
is
by
no
means
theoretical
rubbish
the
right
understanding
of
dimensions
is
of
importance
in
practical
life
the
intermixing
of
dimensions
leads
to
wrong
conclusions
in
our
thought
and
wrong
conclusions
lead
to
disasters
consider
the
classes
of
life
as
representing
three
dimensions
as
explained
in
an
earlier
chapter
then
human
production
belongs
essentially
to
the
human
or
as
i
call
it
the
third
dimension
with
the
base
of
say
we
produce
in
the
third
dimension
a
result
of
units
and
so
when
humans
are
paid
but
units
in
accordance
with
the
standards
of
the
second
dimension
that
of
animals
humanity
is
deprived
of
the
benefit
of
units
of
produced
wealth
that
is
an
illustration
of
what
a
part
dimensions
play
in
practical
life
the
reflective
reader
may
analyse
for
himself
what
effect
these
same
rules
would
have
if
expressed
and
applied
in
the
human
dimension
time
being
the
supreme
test
the
following
table
gives
the
visual
shock
dimension
dimension
dimension
this
explains
why
the
intermixing
of
dimensions
is
the
source
of
tremendous
evil
who
can
now
assert
that
the
problem
of
dimensions
is
one
only
of
theory
it
is
not
even
a
question
of
limitation
of
mind
but
it
becomes
a
question
of
limitation
of
eyesight
not
to
be
able
to
see
the
overwhelming
differences
between
the
laws
of
development
of
the
first
second
and
the
third
dimension
dollars
or
pounds
sterling
or
other
units
of
money
follow
the
same
rules
the
strength
and
in
fact
the
source
of
power
of
modern
capitalism
is
found
in
just
this
difference
in
the
difference
between
what
is
given
and
what
is
taken
in
the
difference
between
what
is
earned
and
what
is
the
problem
of
dimensions
is
therefore
a
key
which
unlocks
the
secrets
of
the
power
of
capitalism
and
opens
the
door
to
a
new
civilization
where
the
understanding
of
dimensions
will
establish
order
out
of
the
chaos
we
have
seen
that
kinetic
and
potential
produced
mainly
by
the
dead
are
bound
up
in
wealth
which
is
measured
and
symbolized
by
money
this
being
true
it
is
obvious
that
money
is
a
measure
and
symbol
of
power
of
work
done
of
time
the
standard
of
miscivilization
has
brought
us
to
an
blind
the
simple
physical
reason
that
there
is
no
more
space
to
practically
all
the
habitable
lands
and
practically
all
the
natural
resources
are
already
divided
among
private
legalistic
owners
what
hope
is
there
for
the
ever
increasing
population
but
we
have
these
living
men
living
of
the
dead
and
sun
that
is
indeed
a
tremendous
power
to
produce
wealth
for
all
if
wisely
directed
but
it
is
ignorantly
and
shamefully
misdirected
because
human
beings
are
not
treated
in
accordance
with
their
nature
as
the
class
of
life
much
more
is
to
be
gained
in
exploiting
nature
aimfully
all
the
time
with
a
full
mobilization
of
our
living
dead
and
than
by
exploiting
man
all
the
time
and
nature
occasionally
selfishness
and
it
these
that
prevent
full
mobilization
of
the
producing
powers
of
the
world
such
as
contribute
most
to
human
progress
and
human
like
gutenberg
copernicus
newton
leibnitz
watts
franklin
mendeleieff
pasteur
edison
steinmetz
loeb
dewey
keyser
whitehead
russell
poincaré
william
benjamin
smith
gibbs
einstein
and
many
no
more
bread
than
the
simplest
of
their
fellow
mortals
indeed
such
men
are
often
in
want
how
many
a
genius
has
perished
inarticulate
because
unable
to
stand
the
strain
of
social
conditions
where
animal
standards
prevail
and
survival
of
the
fittest
means
not
survival
of
the
fittest
in
capacity
but
survival
of
the
strongest
in
ruthlessness
and
competition
wealth
is
produced
by
those
who
work
with
hand
or
brain
and
by
no
others
the
great
mass
of
the
wealth
of
the
world
has
been
thus
produced
by
generations
that
have
gone
we
know
that
the
greatest
wealth
the
been
and
are
scientific
men
discoverers
and
inventors
if
an
invention
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
after
it
is
made
must
become
public
property
then
the
wealth
produced
by
the
of
the
invention
should
also
become
public
property
in
the
course
of
a
like
period
of
years
after
it
is
thus
produced
against
this
proposition
no
sophistry
can
avail
one
of
the
greatest
powers
of
modern
times
is
the
press
it
commands
the
resources
of
space
and
time
it
affects
in
a
thousand
subtle
ways
the
form
of
our
thoughts
it
controls
the
exchange
of
news
throughout
the
world
unfortunately
the
press
is
often
controlled
by
exploiters
of
the
living
powers
of
the
dead
and
so
what
is
presented
as
news
is
frequently
so
limited
colored
and
distorted
by
selfish
interests
as
to
be
falsehood
in
the
guise
of
truth
honest
independent
papers
are
frequently
starved
by
selfish
conspirators
and
forced
to
close
down
thus
the
press
which
is
itself
the
product
in
the
main
of
dead
men
s
toil
is
made
a
means
for
the
deception
and
exploitation
of
the
living
indeed
the
bitter
words
of
voltaire
seem
to
be
too
true
since
god
created
man
in
his
own
image
how
often
has
man
endeavored
to
render
similar
service
to
those
who
want
to
use
such
powers
to
rule
the
world
are
modern
neros
who
in
their
wickedness
and
folly
fancy
themselves
divine
to
deceive
and
through
deception
to
exploit
rob
and
subjugate
living
men
and
women
and
to
do
it
by
prostituting
the
living
powers
created
by
the
dead
is
the
work
i
will
not
say
of
men
but
of
men
greedy
ignorant
and
blind
what
is
the
remedy
revolution
revolution
is
also
mad
the
only
remedy
is
knowledge
of

knowledge
of

survival
of
the
fittest
humanity
is
a
dynamic
affair
nay
the
most
dynamic
known
because
it
is
able
to
transform
and
direct
basic
powers
where
power
is
produced
there
must
be
an
issue
for
it
power
must
perforce
express
itself
in
some
form
electricity
produced
in
the
skies
comes
down
in
an
often
disastrous
manner
electricity
produced
aimfully
runs
our
railroads
just
so
the
enormous
power
produced
by
humanity
must
be
used
aimfully
in
a
constructive
way
or
it
will
burst
into
insurrections
revolutions
and
wars
hitherto
we
have
been
guided
by
those
bottomless
sciences
having
only
mythological
ideas
of
ideas
moulded
by
personal
ambitions
personal
interests
or
downright
ignorance
periodically
we
have
had
all
the
evils
of
the
lack
of
a
common
aim
and
scientific
guidance
power
has
been
held
by
the
or
the
cleverest
seldom
has
the
power
been
given
to
the
fittest
in
the
sense
of
the
most
capable
to
those
who
speak
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
as
in
the
darwinian
theory
of
animals
bark
an
animal
language
this
rule
being
natural
only
in
the
life
of
plants
and
animals
and
appropriate
only
to
the
lower
forms
of
physical
life
can
not
except
with
profound
change
of
meaning
be
applied
to
the
class
of
life
without
disaster
the
modern
vast
accumulation
of
wealth
for
private
purposes
justifies
itself
by
using
the
argument
of
the
survival
of
the
very
well
where
there
is
a
survival
there
must
be
victims
where
there
are
victims
there
has
been
fighting
is
this
what
the
users
of
this
argument
mean
like
the
kaiser
they
talk
peace
and
make
war
this
method
of
doing
things
is
not
in
any
way
new
the
world
has
been
accustomed
to
it
for
a
very
long
while
personally
i
believe
that
most
of
the
masters
of
speculative
such
as
economics
law
ethics
politics
and
government
are
honest
in
their
beliefs
and
speculations
simply
the
right
man
believes
in
the
wrong
thing
if
shown
the
right
way
out
of
the
mess
he
will
cease
to
hamper
progress
he
will
be
of
the
greatest
value
to
the
new
world
built
by
human
engineers
where
human
capacities
exponential
functions
of
time
will
operate
naturally
where
economy
law
ethics
politics
and
government
will
be
not
there
is
a
world
of
difference
between
these
two
words
the
immediate
object
of
this
writing
is
to
show
the
way
to
directing
the
powers
of
mankind
for
the
benefit
of
all
human
technology
as
an
art
and
science
does
not
yet
exist
some
basic
principles
were
required
as
a
foundation
for
such
a
science
especially
was
it
necessary
to
establish
a
standard
and
thus
make
it
certain
and
clear
that
members
of
the
outside
of
the
human
law
the
natural
laws
for
the
human
class
of
life
present
civilization
is
a
very
complicated
affair
although
many
of
our
social
problems
are
very
badly
managed
sudden
changes
could
not
be
made
without
endangering
the
welfare
and
life
of
all
classes
of
society
in
the
meantime
changes
must
be
made
because
the
world
can
not
proceed
much
longer
under
conditions
they
have
been
too
well
exposed
by
facts
for
humanity
to
allow
itself
to
be
blindly
led
again
in
the
world
war
humanity
passed
through
a
tremendous
trial
and
for
those
years
was
under
the
strain
of
an
extensive
mobilization
campaign
the
necessity
of
increasing
power
was
manifest
the
importance
of
a
common
base
or
aim
became
equally
manifest
in
this
case
the
base
the
common
aim
was
found
in
war
this
common
base
enabled
all
the
states
to
add
up
individual
powers
and
build
maximum
efficiency
into
a
power
this
expression
is
used
not
only
as
a
social
truth
but
as
a
known
mathematical
truth
those
high
ideals
which
were
given
urbi
et
orbi
in
thousands
of
speeches
and
in
millions
of
propaganda
papers
had
a
much
greater
educational
importance
and
influence
than
most
people
are
aware
of
people
have
been
awakened
and
have
acquired
the
taste
for
those
higher
purposes
which
in
the
past
were
available
only
for
the
few
many
old
idols
ideas
and
ideals
have
fallen
but
what
is
going
to
take
their
place
we
witness
an
unrest
which
will
not
be
eliminated
until
something
essential
is
done
to
adjust
it
calm
often
betokens
a
coming
storm
the
coming
storm
is
not
the
work
of
any
bad
man
but
it
is
the
inevitable
consequence
of
a
bad
it
is
dangerous
to
hide
our
heads
in
the
sand
like
an
ostrich
and
fancy
we
are
safe
survival
of
the
fittest
in
the
commonly
used
animal
sense
is
not
a
theory
or
principle
for
a
being
this
theory
is
only
for
the
physical
bodies
of
animals
its
effect
upon
humanity
is
sinister
and
degrading
see
app
ii
we
see
the
principle
at
work
all
about
us
in
criminal
exploitation
and
profiteering
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
application
of
this
animal
principle
to
human
affairs
has
degraded
the
whole
human
morale
in
an
inconceivably
way
personal
greed
and
selfishness
are
brazenly
owned
as
principles
of
conduct
we
shrug
our
shoulders
in
acquiescence
and
proclaim
greed
and
selfishness
to
be
the
very
core
of
human
nature
take
it
all
for
granted
and
let
it
pass
at
that
we
have
gone
so
far
in
our
degradation
that
the
prophet
of
capitalistic
principles
adam
smith
in
his
famous
of
arrives
at
the
laws
of
wealth
not
from
the
phenomena
of
wealth
nor
from
statistical
statements
but
from
the
phenomena
of
fact
which
shows
how
in
its
dire
influence
upon
all
humanity
is
the
theory
that
human
beings
are
of
course
the
effect
is
very
disastrous
the
preceding
chapters
have
shown
that
the
theory
is
false
it
is
false
not
only
because
of
its
unhappy
effects
but
it
belies
the
characteristic
nature
of
man
human
nature
this
power
not
only
has
the
peculiar
capacity
for
perpetual
progress
but
it
has
over
and
above
all
animal
propensities
certain
qualities
constituting
it
a
distinctive
dimension
or
type
of
life
not
only
our
whole
collective
life
proves
a
love
for
higher
ideals
but
even
our
dead
us
the
rich
heritage
material
and
spiritual
of
all
their
toils
there
is
nothing
mystical
about
it
to
call
such
a
class
a
selfish
class
is
not
only
nonsensical
but
monstrous
this
capacity
for
higher
ideals
does
not
originate
in
some
outside
factor
it
is
of
extraneous
origin
it
is
the
expression
of
the
element
which
we
possess
independently
of
our
will
it
is
an
inborn
of
nature
we
simply
are
made
this
way
and
not
in
any
other
there
is
indeed
a
fine
sense
in
which
we
can
if
we
choose
apply
the
of
the
the
activity
of
the
energies
of
man
having
the
peculiar
capacity
to
survive
in
our
deeds
we
have
an
inclination
to
use
it
and
we
survive
in
the
deeds
of
our
creation
and
so
there
is
brought
about
the
survival
in
time
of
higher
and
higher
ideals
the
moment
we
consider
man
in
his
proper
in
things
become
simple
stupendous
and
beautiful
note
the
radical
character
of
the
transformation
to
be
effected
the
world
shall
no
longer
be
beheld
as
an
alien
thing
beheld
by
eyes
that
are
not
its
own
conception
of
the
whole
and
by
the
whole
shall
embrace
as
really
literally
consciously
as
the
latest
term
it
may
be
of
an
advancing
sequence
of
developments
as
occupying
the
highest
rank
perhaps
in
the
hierarchy
of
being
but
at
all
events
as
emerged
and
still
emerging
from
some
propensive
source
within
i
grant
that
the
change
in
point
of
view
is
hard
to
habits
like
walls
of
rock
tending
to
confine
the
tides
of
consciousness
within
their
accustomed
it
can
be
made
and
by
assiduous
effort
in
the
course
of
time
maintained
suppose
it
done
by
that
reunion
the
whole
regains
while
the
part
retains
the
consciousness
the
latter
purloined
in
the
whole
universe
of
events
none
is
more
wonderful
than
the
birth
of
wonder
none
more
curious
than
the
nascence
of
curiosity
itself
nothing
to
compare
with
the
dawning
of
consciousness
in
the
ancient
dark
and
the
gradual
extension
of
psychic
life
and
illumination
throughout
a
cosmos
that
before
had
only
an
eternity
of
blindly
acting
transforming
unconscious
existence
assuming
at
length
through
the
birth
of
sense
and
intellect
without
loss
or
break
of
continuity
the
abiding
form
of
fleeting
keyser
loc
cit
it
must
be
emphasized
that
the
development
of
higher
ideals
is
due
to
the
capacity
of
humanity
the
impulse
is
simply
impulse
as
we
have
seen
by
analysing
the
functions
of
the
different
classes
of
life
every
class
of
life
has
an
impulse
to
exercise
its
peculiar
capacity
or
function
nitrogen
resists
compound
combinations
and
if
found
in
such
combinations
it
breaks
away
as
quickly
as
ever
it
can
birds
have
fly
animals
have
run
man
has
the
capacity
of
binds
time
it
does
not
matter
whether
we
understand
the
very
essence
of
the
phenomenon
or
not
any
more
than
we
understand
the
essence
of
electricity
or
any
other
life
shows
that
man
has
capacity
as
a
natural
gift
and
is
naturally
impelled
to
use
it
one
of
the
best
examples
is
procreation
conception
is
a
completely
incomprehensible
phenomenon
in
its
essence
nevertheless
having
the
capacity
to
procreate
we
use
it
without
bothering
about
its
indeed
neither
life
nor
science
bothers
about
essences
leave
essences
to
metaphysics
which
is
neither
life
nor
science
it
is
sufficient
for
our
purpose
that
idealization
is
in
fact
a
natural
process
of
human
energy
and
however
imperfect
ethics
has
been
owing
to
the
prevalence
of
animal
standards
such
merits
as
our
ethics
has
had
witness
to
the
natural
presence
of
idealization
in
human
life
it
is
thus
evident
that
ideals
are
not
things
to
gush
over
or
to
sigh
and
sentimentalize
about
they
are
not
what
would
be
left
if
that
which
is
hard
in
reality
were
taken
away
ideals
are
themselves
the
very
flint
of
reality
beautiful
no
doubt
and
precious
without
which
there
would
be
neither
dignity
nor
hope
nor
light
but
their
aspect
is
not
sentimental
and
soft
it
is
hard
cold
intellectual
logical
austere
idealization
consists
in
the
conception
or
the
intuition
of
ideals
and
in
the
pursuit
of
them
and
ideals
i
have
said
are
of
two
kinds
let
us
make
the
distinction
clearer
every
sort
of
human
horses
abdominal
surgery
or
painting
of
a
peculiar
type
of
excellence
no
sort
of
activity
can
escape
from
its
own
type
but
within
its
type
it
admits
of
indefinite
improvement
for
each
type
there
is
an
dream
of
unattainable
limit
of
an
endless
sequence
of
potential
ameliorations
within
the
type
and
on
its
level
the
dreams
of
such
unattainable
perfections
are
as
countless
as
the
types
of
excellence
to
which
they
respectively
belong
and
they
together
constitute
the
familiar
world
of
our
human
ideals
to
share
in
feel
the
lure
of
perfection
in
one
or
more
types
of
excellence
however
to
be
human
not
to
feel
it
is
to
be
but
this
common
kind
of
idealization
though
it
is
very
important
and
very
precious
does
not
produce
the
great
events
in
the
life
of
mankind
these
are
produced
by
the
kind
of
idealization
that
corresponds
to
what
we
have
called
in
the
mathematical
prototype
kind
of
idealization
that
is
peculiar
to
creative
genius
and
that
not
content
to
pursue
ideals
within
established
types
of
excellences
creates
new
types
thereof
in
science
in
art
in
philosophy
in
letters
in
ethics
in
education
in
social
order
in
all
the
fields
and
forms
of
the
spiritual
life
of
quoted
from
the
manuscript
of
the
forthcoming
book
by
cassius
j
keyser
survival
of
the
fittest
has
a
different
form
for
different
classes
of
life
applying
animal
standards
to
beings
is
like
applying
inches
to
measuring
weight
as
a
matter
or
fact
we
can
not
raise
one
class
to
a
higher
class
unless
we
add
an
entirely
new
function
to
the
former
we
can
only
improve
their
lower
status
but
if
we
apply
the
reverse
method
we
can
degrade
human
standards
to
animal
standards
animal
standards
belong
to
a
class
of
life
whose
capacity
is
an
function
of
there
is
nothing
theological
or
sentimental
in
this
fact
it
is
a
purely
mathematical
truth
it
is
fatal
to
apply
the
survival
of
the
fittest
theory
in
the
same
sense
to
two
radically
different
classes
of
life
the
survival
of
the
fittest
for
survival
which
means
fighting
and
other
brutal
forms
of
struggle
on
the
other
hand
survival
of
the
fittest
for
human
beings
is
for
survival
which
means
intellectual
or
spiritual
competition
struggle
for
excellence
for
making
the
survive
who
make
the
best
those
who
do
the
most
in
producing
values
for
all
mankind
including
this
is
the
scientific
base
for
natural
ethics
and
ethics
from
which
there
can
be
no
or
escape
therefore
can
not
use
logic
without
degrading
themselves
from
their
proper
status
as
human
status
as
established
by
nature
animal
logic
leads
to
animal
ethics
and
animal
economics
it
leads
inevitably
to
a
brutalized
industrial
system
in
which
cunning
contrives
to
rob
the
living
of
the
fruit
of
the
dead
logic
points
to
human
ethics
and
human
economics
it
will
lead
to
a
humanized
industrial
system
in
which
competition
will
be
competition
in
science
in
art
in
justice
a
competition
and
struggle
for
the
attainment
of
excellence
in
human
life
the
capacity
which
manifests
itself
in
drawing
from
the
past
through
the
present
for
the
future
gives
human
beings
the
means
of
attaining
a
precious
kind
of
immortality
it
enables
them
to
fulfill
the
law
of
their
own
class
of
life
and
to
survive
everlastingly
in
the
fruits
of
their
toil
a
perpetual
blessing
to
endless
generations
of
the
children
of
men
this
is
the
truth
we
instinctively
recognize
when
we
call
a
great
man
we
mean
that
he
has
done
deeds
that
in
for
the
perpetual
weal
of
mankind
human
logic
the
logic
for
thus
show
us
that
good
and
just
and
right
are
to
have
their
significance
defined
and
understood
entirely
in
terms
of
human
human
animal
to
be
the
basis
and
guide
of
human
engineering
thus
based
and
guided
human
engineering
will
eliminate
schemers
gamblers
and
it
will
put
an
end
to
industrial
violence
strikes
insurrections
war
and
revolutions
the
present
system
of
social
life
is
largely
built
upon
misconceptions
or
misrepresentations
for
all
work
we
need
the
human
brain
the
human
power
yet
we
continue
to
call
it
and
treat
it
as
such
even
in
mechanical
science
in
the
use
of
the
term
we
are
incorrect
in
this
expression
how
does
this
horse
look
in
reality
let
us
analyse
this
all
science
all
mechanical
appliances
have
been
produced
by
man
and
man
alone
everything
we
possess
is
the
production
of
either
dead
men
s
or
living
men
s
work
the
enslavement
of
the
solar
is
purely
a
human
invention
in
theory
and
practice
everything
we
have
is
evidently
therefore
a
product
what
perfect
nonsense
to
call
a
purely
human
achievement
the
equivalent
of
so
much
of
course
it
does
not
matter
mathematically
what
name
we
give
to
a
unit
of
power
we
may
call
it
a
zeus
or
a
zebra
but
there
is
a
very
vicious
implication
in
using
the
name
of
an
animal
to
denote
a
purely
human
product
everything
in
our
civilization
was
produced
by
man
it
seems
only
reasonable
that
this
unit
of
power
which
is
the
direct
product
of
man
s
work
should
be
correctly
named
after
him
the
educational
effect
would
be
wholesome
and
tremendous
the
human
value
in
work
would
be
thus
emphasized
again
and
again
and
respect
for
human
work
would
be
taught
from
the
beginning
in
the
schools
this
unit
causes
us
to
forget
the
human
part
in
it
and
it
degrades
human
work
to
the
level
of
a
commodity
this
is
an
example
of
the
degrading
influence
of
wrong
conceptions
and
wrong
language
i
said
educational
because
even
our
subconscious
mind
is
affected
by
this
see
app
ii
human
engineering
will
not
interfere
with
any
scientific
research
on
the
contrary
it
will
promote
it
in
many
ways
it
is
to
be
hoped
will
stop
the
nonsense
of
intermixing
dimensions
for
which
we
chastise
children
it
is
the
same
kind
of
blundering
as
when
we
intermix
god
by
human
standards
or
human
beings
by
animal
standards
the
relationship
if
any
between
these
phenomena
or
the
overlapping
of
different
classes
is
interesting
and
important
but
in
studying
such
relationships
of
classes
it
is
fatal
to
mix
the
classes
for
example
if
we
are
studying
the
relations
between
surfaces
and
solids
it
is
fatal
to
mistake
solids
for
surfaces
just
so
too
if
we
stupidly
confuse
humans
with
animals
in
the
reality
of
life
we
are
interested
only
in
the
values
of
the
function
of
the
phenomena
by
themselves
and
to
arrive
at
right
conclusions
we
have
to
use
units
appropriate
to
the
phenomena
the
intermixing
of
units
gives
us
a
wrong
conception
of
the
values
of
each
phenomenon
the
results
of
our
calculations
are
wrong
and
the
outcome
is
a
misconception
of
the
process
of
human
life
the
fact
once
realized
we
will
cease
applying
animal
measures
to
man
even
theology
will
abandon
the
monstrous
habit
animal
units
and
standards
are
to
be
applied
to
animals
human
standards
to
man
divine
standards
to
in
the
dark
ages
with
the
complete
innocence
or
misunderstanding
of
science
the
why
of
things
was
explained
by
the
who
of
things
therein
investigation
culminated
man
was
regarded
as
and
homo
sapiens
animal
spark
of
this
monstrous
formula
was
accepted
as
a
final
an
answer
to
the
question
what
is
man
this
type
of
answer
became
in
the
hands
of
church
and
state
a
powerful
instrument
for
keeping
the
people
in
subjection
the
tendency
of
the
masses
to
let
others
think
for
them
is
not
really
a
the
opposite
the
habit
of
not
thinking
for
one
s
self
is
the
result
of
thousands
of
years
of
subjection
those
in
authority
in
general
used
their
ingenuity
to
keep
the
people
from
thinking
the
most
vital
reason
why
many
humans
appear
to
be
and
are
often
called
stupid
is
that
they
have
been
spoken
to
in
a
language
of
speculation
which
they
instinctively
dislike
and
distrust
thus
there
arose
the
proverb
that
speech
was
made
to
conceal
the
truth
it
is
no
wonder
that
they
appear
stupid
the
wonder
is
that
they
are
not
more
the
truth
is
that
they
will
be
found
to
be
far
less
stupid
when
addressed
in
the
natural
language
of
ascertainable
fact
my
whole
theory
is
based
upon
and
is
in
harmony
with
the
natural
feelings
of
man
the
conceptions
i
introduce
are
based
on
human
natural
different
from
the
speech
of
metaphysical
lead
to
mutual
understanding
and
the
disappearance
of
warring
factions
discrimination
as
the
proverb
rightly
teaches
is
the
beginning
of
mind
the
first
psychic
product
of
that
initial
psychic
act
is
to
discriminate
is
to
produce
the
simplest
possible
example
of
multiplicity
the
discovery
or
better
the
invention
better
still
the
production
best
of
all
the
creation
of
multiplicity
with
its
correlate
of
number
is
therefore
the
most
primitive
achievement
or
manifestation
of
mind
let
us
then
trust
the
arithmetic
instinct
as
fundamental
and
for
instruments
of
thought
that
shall
not
fail
repair
at
once
to
the
domain
of
keyser
loc
cit
the
thinking
few
knew
the
power
there
is
in
thinking
they
wanted
to
have
it
and
to
keep
the
advantage
of
it
for
themselves
witness
the
late
introduction
of
public
schools
belief
in
the
inferiority
of
the
masses
became
the
unwritten
law
of
the
privileged
classes
it
was
forced
upon
rubbed
into
the
subconscious
mind
of
the
masses
by
church
and
state
alike
and
was
humbly
and
dumbly
accepted
by
the
lower
orders
as
their
ignorance
was
proclaimed
as
a
bliss
as
time
went
on
this
coefficient
of
ignorance
became
so
useful
to
some
people
and
some
classes
of
people
that
no
effort
was
spared
to
keep
the
world
in
ignorance
it
gave
a
legalistic
excuse
to
imprison
burn
and
hang
people
for
expressing
an
opinion
which
the
ruling
classes
did
not
like
the
elimination
from
church
from
school
from
universities
of
any
teacher
any
professor
or
any
minister
who
dared
to
exemplify
or
encourage
fearless
investigation
and
freedom
of
speech
became
very
common
it
is
less
common
in
our
generation
but
there
remains
much
to
win
in
the
way
of
freedom
freedom
rightly
understood
is
the
aim
of
human
engineering
but
freedom
is
not
license
it
is
not
licentiousness
freedom
consists
in
living
in
accord
with
the
laws
of
human
accord
with
the
laws
of
man
a
plant
is
free
when
it
is
not
prevented
from
living
and
growing
according
to
the
natural
laws
of
plant
life
an
animal
is
free
when
it
is
not
prevented
from
living
according
to
the
natural
laws
of
animal
life
human
beings
are
free
when
and
only
when
they
are
not

with
the

of

i
say
when
not
prevented

human
beings

live
and
therefore
in
freedom
when
they
are
not

from
thus
living
by
ignorance
of
what
human
nature
is
and
by
artificial
social
systems
established
maintained
and

by
such
ignorance
human
freedom
consists
in
exercising
the
energies
of
man
in

with
the
natural
laws
of
such
natural
energies
human
freedom
is
thus
the
aim
of
human
engineering
because
human
engineering
is
to
be
the
science
of
human
nature
and
the
art
of
conducting
human
affairs

chapter
viii
elements
of
power
in
the
world
war
germany
displayed
tremendous
restraining
our
emotions
as
much
as
possible
let
us
endeavor
to
analyse
that
power
with
mathematical
dispassionateness
why
did
germany
display
more
power
than
any
other
single
nation
because
in
the
establishment
of
her
ethics
her
political
system
and
her
economic
structure
germany
availed
herself
in
larger
measure
than
any
other
nation
of
scientific
achievements
and
scientific
methods
it
is
a
very
common
very
erroneous
and
very
harmful
belief
that
war
was
created
solely
by
a
every
idea
or
movement
doubtless
originates
with
somebody
but
back
of
such
originations
or
initiations
there
are
favoring
conditions
forces
and
impulsions
the
stage
is
set
by
life
and
the
ages
the
actor
enters
and
the
show
begins
in
the
instance
in
question
the
stage
was
set
by
our
whole
modern
system
of
civilization
the
war
lords
were
the
deus
ex
machina
show
was
a
real
tragedy
the
true
origin
of
this
war
must
be
looked
for
in
the
economic
field
our
economic
system
is
the
very
complicated
result
of
all
our
creeds
philosophies
and
social
customs
it
is
therefore
impossible
to
understand
the
working
of
the
economic
forces
without
understanding
the
foundation
upon
which
this
system
of
forces
is
based
a
short
list
of
works
on
the
subject
is
given
at
the
end
of
this
book
a
plain
statement
here
will
be
enough
germany
was
committed
to
a
policy
of
indefinite
industrial
expansion
this
artificial
expansion
had
reached
its
limits
germany
was
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
only
a
victorious
war
could
avoid
a
national
catastrophe
she
played
her
last
card
and
lost
despite
her
gigantic
power
the
greatest
ever
displayed
by
any
nation
the
leading
european
states
were
not
able
to
overpower
her
for
a
long
time
this
writing
is
not
intended
as
an
apology
for
germany
much
less
to
praise
her
or
her
war
lords
german
purposes
were
nationally
narrow
and
nationally
selfish
to
the
root
her
methods
were
inhuman
but
germany
displayed
power
and
without
the
understanding
of
power
human
engineering
is
impossible
it
is
possibly
a
fault
of
the
writer
s
military
training
but
it
seems
to
him
that
the
general
staff
point
of
view
has
as
much
claim
to
consideration
as
any
other
among
the
many
different
interpretations
of
it
has
more
it
is
not
the
primary
aim
of
the
general
staff
to
fight
very
far
from
it
their
primary
aim
is
victory
and
all
the
better
if
victory
be
possible
without
a
fight
strategy
intelligence
knowledge
of
are
the
chief
weapons
brutal
fighting
is
only
a
last
resort
it
is
highly
important
to
bear
that
in
mind
soldiers
and
engineers
do
not
act
germany
affords
the
first
example
of
a
philosophy
or
a
society
having
for
its
main
purpose
the
generating
of
power
to
do
it
seems
only
reasonable
and
intelligent
to
analyse
the
history
of
the
war
from
the
engineer
s
point
of
view
which
in
this
case
happens
to
coincide
with
the
military
point
of
view
it
must
be
clearly
understood
that
the
modern
general
staff
or
military
point
of
view
has
very
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
romance
or
poetry
of
war
war
is
a
grim
business
before
all
else
it
has
to
mobilize
all
the
resources
of
a
nation
and
generate
power
to
the
limit
of
its
capacity
the
conduct
of
war
is
a
technological
methods
have
to
be
engineering
methods
to
crush
an
obstacle
there
is
need
of
a
giant
hammer
and
the
more
mass
that
can
be
given
it
and
the
greater
the
force
put
behind
it
the
more
deadly
will
be
the
blow
prior
to
the
world
war
technology
had
not
been
mobilized
on
so
vast
a
scale
nor
confronted
with
a
task
so
gigantic
mobilized
technology
has
revealed
and
demonstrated
the
fact
that
it
is
possible
to
generate
almost
unlimited
power
and
has
shown
the
way
to
do
it
at
the
same
time
it
has
demonstrated
the
measureless
potency
of
engineering
and
our
utter
helplessness
without
it
technology
is
comparatively
a
new
science
by
some
it
is
called
a
because
it
deals
primarily
with
the
application
of
science
to
practical
issues
but
when
it
became
necessary
to
do
things
an
engineer
had
to
be
called
the
general
staff
had
to
adopt
his
view
and
all
other
practices
and
traditions
were
bent
to
his
ideas
i
have
already
repeatedly
pointed
out
that
the
progress
of
technology
proceeds
according
to
a
law
like
that
of
a
rapidly
increasing
geometrical
progression
and
i
have
stressed
the
danger
of
inattention
to
any
phenomena
force
or
movement
that
conforms
to
such
a
law
we
have
only
to
recollect
the
story
of
the
simple
but
very
greedy
farmer
who
was
very
happy
to
make
a
contract
with
a
laborer
for
a
month
s
work
paying
him
only
one
cent
the
first
day
twice
as
much
the
second
twice
for
the
third
and
so
on
to
the
end
behold
the
bill
for
the
month
ran
into
millions
of
dollars
and
the
farmer
was
ruined
such
is
the
deadly
secret
of
the
geometrical
progression
violent
readjustments
await
any
society
whose
ethics
jurisprudence
and
the
like
do
not
keep
pace
with
the
developments
of
engineering
engineers
are
the
wizards
who
using
the
results
of
scientific
research
can
subjugate
or
release
the
concealed
powers
of
nature
the
supreme
factor
is
the
use
of
the
exponential
function
of
energy
of
man
from
that
we
have
to
take
our
start
because
that
is
the
source
of
human
power
the
german
philosophy
as
a
whole
has
its
definite
place
in
the
history
of
philosophy
and
the
first
thing
to
consider
are
those
philosophic
writers
who
directly
and
indirectly
have
contributed
to
the
building
up
of
german
power
hegel
greatly
affected
the
building
up
of
the
german
as
it
may
seem
but
hegel
was
greatly
under
the
influence
of
the
work
of
fichte
and
fichte
in
turn
under
that
of
spinoza
all
of
them
were
in
a
way
mathematicians
in
their
methods
and
philosophy
as
much
as
they
could
be
in
their
time
i
said
strange
because
it
is
significant
that
the
mathematical
part
of
their
philosophy
was
just
the
part
which
built
up
the
german
power
but
if
we
look
into
it
it
is
not
strange
it
had
to
be
so
because
mathematical
and
mechanical
methods
are
the
only
ones
by
which
power
can
be
understood
and
built
hegel
in
lectured
on
history
of
philosophy
pure
mathematics
and
natural
law
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
better
combination
for
a
philosophy
of
power
that
is
precisely
what
this
philosophy
was
it
influenced
not
only
german
philosophy
but
even
german
theology
and
through
these
channels
it
sank
deep
into
the
national
consciousness
it
affected
every
phase
of
life
an
immense
cult
of
disciples
arose
each
one
added
something
to
that
philosophy
of
power
one
of
the
most
brilliant
representatives
of
this
movement
is
professor
oswald
who
in
his
gave
the
famous
advice
do
not
waste
energy
but
give
it
the
german
understanding
of
the
great
value
of
technology
directly
applied
that
principle
to
their
philosophy
law
ethics
politics
and
so
on
with
increase
of
population
the
problem
of
the
state
becomes
more
and
more
pressing
there
are
many
theories
about
the
state
for
the
purpose
of
the
moment
it
is
important
to
realize
that
a
state
is
the
governing
center
of
an
accumulation
of
human
exponential
functions
of
time
these
powers
though
the
same
in
kind
differ
in
degree
and
in
respect
of
individuality
if
they
are
to
be
united
so
as
to
constitute
a
whole
they
must
be
given
a
common
aim
they
must
so
to
speak
be
reduced
to
a
common
base
if
they
be
respectively
and
so
on
we
can
not
unite
them
and
compute
the
whole
by
adding
the
exponents
but
if
we
give
them
a
common
common
aim
or
we
can
readily
represent
the
magnitudes
of
the
whole
constituted
by
them
if
we
take
to
be
their
common
aim
or
base
then
if
and
so
on
we
shall
have
the
last
expression
where
the
parenthetical
coefficient
is
the
product
of
individualities
serves
to
represent
the
united
powers
of
all
in
terms
of
the
common
base
purpose
or
aim
let
us
look
at
the
matter
in
another
way
one
mechanical
is
less
than
the
power
of
one
living
horse
one
living
horse
can
do
more
work
than
one
mechanical
but
in
using
more
than
one
living
horse
at
one
time
we
get
less
work
than
by
using
the
same
number
of
mechanical
the
reason
is
very
obvious
the
mechanical
are
the
same
in
kind
equal
and
constant
but
living
horses
differ
in
character
they
are
not
equal
and
each
one
is
a
variable
hence
mechanical
can
be
added
or
multiplied
arithmetically
but
the
powers
of
living
horses
can
not
except
very
roughly
the
living
horses
of
a
team
interfere
with
each
other
they
do
not
pull
together
as
we
say
and
energy
is
lost
the
german
mathematical
philosophy
or
theory
of
the
state
did
not
express
itself
in
just
this
way
but
the
foregoing
gives
a
clue
to
it
germany
united
the
powers
of
living
men
and
women
and
children
it
gave
them
a
common
base
it
gave
them
one
common
social
mood
and
aim
they
all
became
consolidated
in
service
of
that
which
is
called
the
state
they
studied
and
taught
for
the
state
they
worked
lived
and
died
for
the
state
the
state
was
their
idol
king
and
god
such
was
the
aim
of
german
philosophy
theology
law
and
science
the
establishment
of
one
aim
for
all
was
the
decisive
factor
it
is
obvious
that
if
we
want
to
inspire
millions
of
individuals
with
one
aim
this
aim
can
not
be
private
or
personal
it
must
be
a
higher
aim
collective
general
impersonal
in
some
way
uniting
and
including
all
personal
aims
i
shall
call
it
simply
a
aim
but
collective
aims
may
differ
profoundly
in
kind
out
of
personal
or
egoistic
aims
there
grows
a
series
of
collective
aims
increasing
in
generality
such
as
family
aims
association
congregation
club
aims
class
or
professional
aims
national
or
race
aims
and
finally
human
natural
aims
for
the
class
of
life
the
fatal
error
of
german
political
philosophy
was
an
error
of
aim
was
too
welfare
of
a
state
instead
of
the
welfare
of
humanity
in
the
case
of
germany
the
national
aim
was
equivalent
to
the
state
aim
german
philosophy
made
the
state
equivalent
to
the
good
and
equivalent
to
of
course
such
philosophy
influenced
the
whole
national
life
in
every
detail
in
consequence
germany
proclaimed
herself
the
first
nation
of
the
world
and
this
soon
evolved
into
a
plan
for
the
conquest
of
the
world
the
german
general
staff
as
an
institution
had
par
excellence
as
its
aim
and
first
object
power
concentration
of
power
and
it
took
the
leadership
in
all
branches
of
life
and
industry
militarism
and
industrialism
are
almost
synonymous
from
the
mechanical
point
of
view
they
are
both
of
them
power
they
both
have
to
use
the
same
scientific
methods
and
in
the
conditions
of
the
world
they
are
dependent
upon
each
other
for
war
can
not
be
waged
without
strong
industries
here
we
have
to
face
the
fact
that
geometrically
progressing
industry
can
not
live
without
new
markets
which
under
present
conditions
have
been
largely
acquired
directly
or
indirectly
by
the
power
of
the
army
and
this
has
been
the
case
with
germany
if
we
curse
germany
for
being
a
military
nation
we
can
with
no
less
justice
curse
her
for
being
a
industrialized
if
we
add
to
that
her
nationally
selfish
and
narrow
national
aim
we
will
readily
understand
this
world
those
who
have
tasted
it
know
something
of
its
sweetness
there
is
no
need
to
go
into
further
details
special
books
give
us
all
the
data
that
which
is
of
interest
is
the
impersonal
fact
that
what
was
the
and
of
germany
is
the
best
possible
illustration
we
have
had
of
what
science
and
a
sort
of
mathematical
philosophy
are
able
to
accomplish
even
when
directed
not
to
the
welfare
of
humanity
but
to
that
of
a
relatively
small
group
of
people
the
political
philosophies
had
a
very
pronounced
effect
upon
marx
one
of
the
branches
of
socialism
is
the
state
socialism
state
socialists
as
the
name
indicates
believe
that
the
state
should
assume
the
most
important
functions
in
society
it
is
obvious
that
in
monarchical
countries
where
rulers
represent
the
state
such
a
theory
is
not
unwelcome
as
it
gives
the
rulers
an
opportunity
to
show
a
sort
of
advanced
liberalism
which
serves
to
strengthen
their
power
the
astute
bismarck
can
not
be
suspected
of
being
a
progressionist
in
the
modern
sense
but
being
a
product
of
german
culture
and
philosophy
all
his
ideals
were
those
of
a
strong
state
he
was
a
proclaimed
advocate
of
state
socialism
since
at
least
bismarck
was
considered
almost
the
leading
spirit
of
paternal
state
socialism
he
was
a
believer
and
promoter
of
the
close
relation
of
the
state
and
the
railways
keeping
always
in
view
a
thorough
nationalization
which
he
finally
accomplished
this
fact
eliminated
from
german
public
life
all
that
phase
of
corruption
which
private
ownership
of
railroads
brings
in
any
country
the
railroad
being
the
very
life
of
any
country
to
sum
up
germany
applied
the
most
scientific
methods
to
build
up
her
national
power
she
understood
the
elements
of
power
for
they
were
disclosed
to
her
by
her
science
and
her
philosophy
she
applied
technological
methods
in
every
part
of
her
civil
life
and
thus
built
her
gigantic
power
her
industrial
life
followed
the
military
way
her
military
strength
was
built
on
industrial
power
and
so
the
vicious
circle
germany
adopted
a
aim
instead
of
a
personal
individualistic
aim
and
because
of
this
broader
aim
she
was
able
to
mobilize
and
to
keep
mobilized
all
her
moral
political
and
industrial
forces
for
long
years
before
the
war
the
direct
effect
of
this
system
of
continuous
mobilization
was
for
this
she
desperately
needed
new
markets
the
cheapest
and
quickest
way
to
acquire
them
if
they
were
not
to
be
grabbed
otherwise
was
to
conquer
them
by
a
victorious
war
her
plans
progressed
according
to
the
program
all
except
the
victory
in
the
battle
fields
this
war
was
a
calamity
of
unprecedented
magnitude
for
the
world
and
it
is
our
duty
to
study
it
dispassionately
and
learn
the
lesson
of
it
if
we
do
not
want
to
be
moral
accomplices
of
this
great
modern
crime
by
letting
the
world
drift
into
an
even
worse
catastrophe
we
have
to
arouse
ourselves
from
our
inertia
and
go
to
the
bottom
of
this
problem
and
analyse
it
ruthlessly
no
matter
whether
the
analysis
be
pleasant
or
not
we
must
value
everyone
of
our
ten
sacred
dead
at
least
as
much
as
we
value
one
rabbit
killed
in
scientific
laboratories
and
take
the
lesson
to
heart
or
be
prepared
for
a
repetition
of
world
slaughter
if
human
engineering
had
been
established
long
ago
our
social
system
would
have
been
different
our
civilization
would
have
been
much
higher
this
war
would
have
been
avoided
we
do
not
need
to
delude
ourselves
the
world
war
was
the
result
of
badly
balanced
social
and
economic
forces
the
world
needs
other
balances
of
power
than
such
as
are
devised
by
lawyers
and
politicians

humanity
is
reaching
out
for
a
science
and
art
of
human
guidance
based
upon
a
right
understanding
of
human
nature
chapter
ix
manhood
of
humanity
in
a
previous
chapter
i
have
said
that
the
world
war
marks
the
end
of
one
vast
period
in
the
life
of
humankind
and
marks
the
beginning
of
another
it
marks
the
end
of
humanity
s
childhood
and
the
beginning
of
humanity
s
manhood
our
human
past
is
a
mighty
fact
of
our
world
many
facts
are
unstable
impermanent
and
are
here
and
they
are
gone
not
so
with
the
great
fact
of
our
human
past
our
past
abides
it
is
permanent
it
can
be
counted
on
it
is
nearly
eternal
as
the
race
of
man
out
of
that
past
we
have
come
into
it
we
are
constantly
returning
meanwhile
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
our
lives
it
contains
the
of
all
we
are
and
of
all
we
have
of
wisdom
of
science
of
philosophy
of
art
of
jurisprudence
of
customs
and
institutions
it
contains
the
record
or
ruins
of
all
the
experiments
that
man
has
made
during
a
quarter
or
a
half
million
years
in
the
art
of
living
in
this
keyser
worth
of
rigorous
in
our
relation
to
the
past
there
are
three
ways
in
which
one
may
be
a
fool
one
of
the
ways
is
the
way
of
ignoring
the
way
of
remaining
blankly
ignorant
of
the
human
past
as
the
animals
are
blankly
ignorant
of
past
and
so
of
drifting
through
life
as
animals
do
without
reference
to
the
experience
of
bygone
generations
fools
of
this
type
may
be
called
drifting
fools
or
drifters
another
way
to
be
a
very
alluring
that
of
falsifying
the
past
by
stupidly
disregarding
its
vices
misery
ignorance
slothfulness
and
folly
and
stupidly
magnifying
its
virtues
happiness
knowledge
achievements
and
wisdom
it
is
the
way
of
the
way
of
those
who
being
comfortably
situated
and
prosperous
are
opposed
to
change
the
past
they
say
was
wise
for
it
produced
the
present
and
the
present
is
us
alone
fools
of
this
type
may
be
called
idolatrous
fools
worshiping
the
past
or
static
fools
contented
with
the
present
or
cowardly
fools
opposed
to
change
fearful
of
the
future
a
third
way
to
be
a
is
also
the
opposite
of
the
foregoing
it
is
the
way
of
those
who
falsify
the
past
by
stupidly
and
contemptuously
disregarding
its
virtues
its
happiness
its
knowledge
its
great
achievements
and
its
wisdom
and
by
stupidly
or
dishonestly
magnifying
its
vices
its
misery
its
ignorance
its
great
slothfulness
and
its
folly
it
is
apt
to
be
the
way
of
the
woeful
the
unprosperous
the
the
way
of
such
as
find
escape
from
the
bore
of
routine
life
in
the
excitements
of
unrest
turbulence
and
change
the
past
they
say
was
all
wrong
for
it
produced
the
present
and
the
present
is
thoroughly
us
destroy
it
root
and
branch
fools
of
this
type
may
be
called
scorning
fools
scorners
of
the
past
or
destroying
fools
destroyers
of
the
present
or
dynamic
fools
revelers
in
the
excitements
of
change
such
are
the
children
of
folly
drifting
of
the
of
race
floaters
on
the
shifting
currents
of
human
affairs
static
of
the
lovers
of
the
of
of
the
future
dynamic
of
the
of
the
of
the
works
of
the
of
fools
each
of
them
saying
what
ought
to
be
begins
with
i
will
make
the
world
a
paradise
but
my
genius
must
be
free
it
is
hampered
by
the
existing
order
bungling
work
of
the
past
i
will
destroy
it
i
will
start
with
chaos
we
need
sun
casts
will
begin
by
blotting
out
the
sun
then
the
world
will
be
full
of
light
of
my
in
striking
contrast
with
that
division
of
folly
the
counsel
of
wisdom
is
one
and
it
is
one
with
the
sober
counsel
of
common
sense
what
is
that
counsel
what
is
the
united
counsel
of
wisdom
and
common
sense
respecting
the
past
the
answer
is
easy
and
easy
to
understand
the
counsel
is
this
do
not
ignore
the
past
but
study
it
diligently
as
being
the
mightiest
factor
among
the
great
factors
of
our
human
world
endeavor
to
view
the
past
justly
to
contemplate
it
as
it
was
and
is
to
see
it
see
it
in
true
neither
its
good
nor
its
evil
neither
its
knowledge
nor
its
ignorance
neither
its
enterprise
nor
its
slothfulness
neither
its
achievements
nor
its
failures
as
the
salient
facts
are
ascertained
endeavor
to
account
for
them
to
find
their
causes
their
favoring
conditions
to
explain
the
facts
to
understand
them
applying
always
the
question
centuries
of
centuries
of
cruel
centuries
of
centuries
of
almost
complete
ignorance
of
natural
centuries
of
centuries
of
monstrous
misconceptions
of
human
measureless
creations
wastings
and
destructions
of
endless
rolling
cycles
of
enterprise
stagnation
and
interminable
alterations
of
peace
and
war
enslavements
and
age
after
age
of
worship
of
gods
silly
savage
enthroned
by
myth
and
magic
celebrated
and
supported
by
poetry
and
the
wayward
speculations
of
ignorant
sages
age
upon
age
of
slow
developments
of
useful
inventions
craftsmanship
commerce
and
ages
of
dark
impulsive
groping
before
the
slow
discovery
of
reason
followed
by
centuries
of
belief
in
the
sufficiency
of
ratiocination
unaided
by
systematic
observation
and
at
length
the
dawn
of
scientific
method
and
science
the
growth
of
natural
knowledge
immeasurable
expansion
of
the
universe
and
belief
in
the
lawfulness
of
nature
rapidly
increasing
subjugation
of
natural
forces
to
human
control
growing
faith
in
the
limitless
progressibility
of
human
knowledge
and
in
the
limitless
perfectibility
of
human
the
widely
diverse
peoples
of
the
world
constrained
by
scientific
progress
to
live
together
as
in
one
community
upon
a
greatly
shrunken
and
rapidly
shrinking
planet
the
unpreparedness
of
existing
ethics
law
philosophy
economics
politics
and
government
to
meet
the
exigencies
thus
such
i
take
to
be
the
counsel
of
simple
wisdom
of
sober
common
sense
to
ascertain
the
salient
facts
of
our
immense
human
past
and
then
to
explain
them
in
terms
of
their
causes
and
conditions
is
not
an
easy
task
it
is
an
exceedingly
difficult
one
requiring
the
labor
of
many
men
of
many
generations
but
it
must
be
performed
for
it
is
only
in
proportion
as
we
learn
to
know
the
great
facts
of
our
human
past
and
their
causes
that
we
are
enabled
to
understand
our
human
present
for
the
present
is
the
child
of
the
past
and
it
is
only
in
proportion
as
we
thus
learn
to
understand
the
present
that
we
can
face
the
future
with
confidence
and
competence
past
present
can
not
be
understood
singly
and
are
welded
together
indissolubly
as
the
period
of
humanity
s
childhood
has
been
to
years
according
to
the
witness
of
human
relics
ruins
and
records
of
the
caves
and
the
stretch
of
time
too
vast
for
our
imaginations
to
grasp
of
that
immense
succession
of
ages
except
a
minute
fraction
of
it
including
our
own
time
we
have
properly
speaking
no
history
we
have
only
a
rude
dim
broken
outline
herodotus
whom
we
call
the
father
of
history
proper
lived
less
than
years
ago
what
is
years
compared
with
the
whole
backward
stretch
of
human
time
we
have
to
say
that
the
father
of
human
history
lived
but
virtual
contemporary
of
those
now
living
our
humankind
groped
upon
this
globe
for
probably
years
before
the
writing
of
what
we
call
history
had
even
begun
if
we
regard
history
as
a
kind
of
what
must
we
say
of
our
race
s
memory
it
is
like
that
of
a
man
of
years
whose
recollection
extends
back
less
than
months
or
like
that
of
a
man
of
years
whose
recollection
fails
to
reach
any
event
of
the
first
years
of
his
life
owing
to
the
work
of
geologists
paleontologists
ethnologists
and
their
the
history
of
prehistoric
man
will
grow
just
as
we
know
more
about
the
life
of
mankind
in
the
time
of
herodotus
than
herodotus
himself
knew
meanwhile
we
must
try
to
make
the
best
use
of
such
historical
knowledge
of
man
as
we
now
possess
even
if
the
story
of
humanity
s
childhood
were
fully
recorded
in
the
libraries
of
the
world
it
would
not
be
possible
in
this
brief
writing
to
recount
the
story
in
even
the
most
summary
fashion
except
the
tale
of
recent
years
the
story
is
known
as
i
have
said
only
in
outline
rude
dim
and
broken
but
for
the
present
purpose
this
will
suffice
countless
multitudes
of
details
are
of
them
doubtless
forever
but
we
need
not
despair
the
really
great
facts
of
our
racial
massive
dominant
outstanding
sufficiently
clear
for
our
guidance
in
the
present
enterprise
and
what
do
we
know
we
know
that
the
period
of
our
human
childhood
has
been
inconceivably
long
we
know
that
in
the
far
distant
time
the
first
specimens
of
initial
members
of
the
race
of
absolutely
without
human
knowledge
of
the
hostile
world
in
which
they
found
themselves
we
know
that
they
had
no
conception
of
what
they
themselves
were
we
know
that
they
had
neither
speech
nor
art
nor
philosophy
nor
religion
nor
science
nor
tools
nor
human
history
nor
human
tradition
we
know
though
we
can
hardly
imagine
it
that
their
equipment
for
the
career
of
the
human
race
was
that
peculiar
faculty
which
made
them
capacity
of
man
for
binding
time
we
know
that
they
actually
did
that
work
of
initiation
without
any
guidance
or
example
maxim
or
precedent
and
we
know
that
they
were
able
to
do
it
just
because
the
power
of
power
to
a
power
what
else
do
we
know
of
the
earliest
part
of
humanity
s
childhood
we
know
that
in
that
age
our
not
animals
but
human
only
to
live
in
the
human
dimension
of
above
the
level
of
therein
taking
not
only
the
first
step
but
the
second
the
third
and
so
on
indefinitely
we
know
in
other
words
that
they
were
progressive
creatures
that
they
made
advancement
we
know
that
their
progress
was
to
natural
as
swimming
is
to
fishes
or
as
flying
is
to
both
the
impulse
and
the
ability
to
make
do
greater
things
by
help
of
things
already
of
the
very
nature
of
the
capacity
which
makes
humans
human
we
know
that
capacity
for
accumulating
racial
experience
enlarging
it
and
transmitting
it
for
future
the
peculiar
power
the
characteristic
energy
the
definitive
nature
the
defining
mark
of
man
we
know
that
the
mental
power
the
capacity
of
our
ancestors
was
the
same
in
as
our
own
if
not
in
degree
we
know
that
it
is
natural
for
this
capacity
the
highest
known
agency
of
nature
to
produce
ideas
inventions
insights
doctrines
knowledge
and
other
forms
of
wealth
we
know
that
progress
in
what
we
call
civilization
which
is
nothing
but
progress
in
the
production
and
right
use
of
material
and
spiritual
wealth
has
been
possible
and
actual
simply
and
solely
because
the
products
of
work
not
only
but
naturally
tend
to
propagate
their
begetting
ideas
inventions
leading
to
other
inventions
knowledge
breeding
knowledge
we
therefore
know
that
the
amount
of
progress
which
a
single
generation
can
make
if
it
have
an
adequate
supply
of
raw
material
and
be
unhampered
by
hostile
circumstances
depends
not
only
upon
its
native
capacity
for
binding
time
but
this
is
of
the
utmost
the
total
progress
made
by
preceding
the
inherited
fruit
that
is
of
the
toil
of
the
dead
accordingly
we
know
that
the
amount
of
progress
a
single
generation
can
thus
make
is
what
mathematicians
call
an
increasing
function
of
time
and
not
only
an
increasing
function
but
an
increasing
function
of
function
like
as
already
explained
we
know
too
that
the
progress
which
successive
generations
can
thus
make
is
which
is
also
an
increasing
exponential
function
of
time
we
know
from
the
differential
calculus
that
these
represent
natural
laws
laws
of
human
laws
of
the
energies
of
very
remarkable
only
do
they
increase
with
time
but
their
of
increase
are
also
exponential
functions
of
time
and
so
the
rates
of
increase
themselves
increase
at
rates
which
are
again
exponential
functions
and
so
on
and
on
without
limit
that
i
say
is
a
marvelous
fact
and
it
is
for
us
a
fact
of
immeasurable
significance
for
it
means
that
the
power
of
man
is
such
that
if
it
be
allowed
to
operate
naturally
production
and
right
use
of
material
and
spiritual
not
only
grow
towards
infinity
as
mathematicians
say
but
will
thus
grow
with
a
which
is
not
constant
but
which
itself
grows
towards
infinity
with
a
swiftness
which
again
is
not
constant
but
increases
according
to
the
same
law
and
so
on
indefinitely
we
thus
see
if
we
will
only
retire
to
our
cloisters
and
contemplate
it
that
the
proper
life
of
man
is
not
like
that
of
animals
but
is
we
thus
see
that
in
distinctively
human
life
in
the
life
of
man
as
man
the
past
is
present
and
the
dead
survive
destined
to
greet
and
to
bless
the
unborn
generations
time
time
is
literally
of
the
core
and
substance
of
civilization
so
it
has
been
since
the
beginning
of
man
we
know
that
the
total
progress
made
in
the
long
course
of
humanity
s
childhood
though
it
is
absolutely
great
is
relatively
small
we
know
that
compared
with
our
present
civilization
is
vast
and
rich
in
many
ways
we
know
however
that
if
the
energies
of
humanity
had
been
always
permitted
to
operate
unhampered
by
hostile
circumstances
they
would
long
ere
now
have
produced
a
state
of
civilization
compared
with
which
our
present
estate
would
seem
mean
meagre
savage
for
we
know
that
those
peculiar
energies
of
from
being
always
permitted
to
operate
according
to
the
laws
of
their
nature
have
been
permitted
so
to
operate
but
have
always
been
hampered
and
are
hampered
by
hostile
circumstances
and
if
we
reflect
we
may
know
well
enough
what
the
hostile
been
and
are
we
know
that
in
the
beginning
of
humanity
s
its
babyhood
so
to
was
as
already
said
no
whatever
to
start
material
spiritual
wealth
in
the
form
of
knowledge
of
the
world
or
the
nature
of
existing
fruit
of
dead
men
s
but
wild
and
raw
material
whose
very
location
properties
and
potencies
had
all
to
be
discovered
even
now
because
we
have
inherited
so
much
time
and
because
our
imaginations
have
been
so
little
disciplined
to
understand
realities
we
can
scarcely
picture
to
ourselves
the
actual
conditions
of
that
time
of
humanity
s
babyhood
still
less
do
we
realize
that
present
civilization
has
hardly
begun
to
be
that
of
enlightened
men
we
know
moreover
that
the
energies
of
our
remote
ancestors
were
hampered
and
baulked
in
a
measure
too
vast
for
our
imaginations
by
immense
geologic
and
climatic
changes
both
sudden
and
secular
unforeseen
and
earthquake
and
storm
by
seasons
of
flood
and
frost
and
heat
and
drought
not
only
destroying
both
natural
resources
and
the
slowly
accumulated
products
of
generations
but
often
extinguishing
the
people
themselves
with
the
centers
and
abodes
of
struggling
civilization
of
all
the
hostile
circumstances
of
all
the
causes
which
throughout
the
long
period
of
humanity
s
childhood
have
operated
to
keep
civilization
and
human
welfare
from
progressing
in
full
accord
with
the
natural
laws
of
the
energies
of
man
the
most
potent
cause
and
most
disastrous
a
cause
still
everywhere
in
operation
remains
to
be
mentioned
i
mean
human
ignorance
i
do
not
mean
ignorance
of
physical
facts
and
the
laws
of
physical
nature
for
this
latter
ignorance
is
in
large
measure
the
effect
of
the
cause
i
have
in
mind
the
ignorance
i
mean
is
far
more
fundamental
and
far
more
potent
i
mean
human
ignorance
of
mean
man
s
ignorance
of
what
man
mean
false
conceptions
of
the
rightful
place
of
man
in
the
scheme
of
life
and
the
order
of
the
world
what
the
false
conceptions
are
i
have
already
pointed
out
they
are
two
one
of
them
is
the
conception
according
to
which
human
beings
are
animals
the
other
one
is
the
conception
according
to
which
human
beings
have
no
place
in
nature
but
are
hybrids
of
natural
and
animals
combined
with
something
both
of
them
are
characteristic
of
humanity
s
childhood
both
of
them
are
erroneous
and
both
of
them
have
done
infinite
harm
in
a
thousand
ways
whose
is
the
fault
in
a
deep
sense
it
is
the
fault
of
none
man
started
with
no
nothing
but
his
physical
strength
and
the
natural
stirring
within
of
the
capacity
for
binding
time
and
so
he
had
to
grope
it
is
not
strange
that
he
was
puzzled
by
himself
it
is
not
strange
that
he
thought
himself
an
animal
for
he
has
animal
propensities
as
a
cube
has
surfaces
and
his
animal
propensities
were
so
obtrusive
so
very
evident
to
physical
was
born
grew
had
legs
and
hair
ate
ran
slept
just
like
his
distinctive
mark
his
capacity
was
subtle
it
was
spiritual
it
was
not
a
but
an
it
was
the
energy
called
intellect
or
mind
which
the
physical
senses
do
not
perceive
and
so
i
say
it
is
not
is
indeed
very
sad
and
very
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
human
beings
have
falsely
believed
themselves
to
be
animals
so
too
of
the
rival
belief
that
humans
are
neither
natural
nor
supernatural
but
are
both
at
once
at
once
brutal
and
divine
hybrid
offspring
of
beast
and
god
the
belief
is
monstrous
it
is
very
pathetic
and
very
sad
but
its
origin
is
easy
to
understand
once
invented
it
became
a
powerful
instrument
for
evil
men
for
impostors
but
it
was
not
invented
by
them
it
was
only
an
erroneous
result
of
an
honest
effort
to
understand
and
to
explain
for
the
obvious
facts
created
a
real
puzzle
to
be
explained
on
the
one
hand
men
women
and
and
human
resembled
animals
physically
in
a
hundred
unmistakable
ways
on
the
other
hand
it
became
more
and
more
evident
that
the
same
human
beings
could
do
many
things
which
animals
never
did
and
could
not
do
here
was
a
puzzle
a
mystery
curiosity
demanded
an
explanation
what
was
it
to
be
natural
science
had
not
yet
arisen
critical
that
avoids
the
mixing
of
in
the
state
of
feeble
infancy
it
is
easy
to
understand
what
the
answer
had
to
and
mythical
and
so
it
are
neither
animals
nor
gods
neither
natural
nor
they
are
both
at
once
a
mixture
a
mysterious
union
of
animal
with
something
such
then
are
the
two
rival
answers
which
in
the
long
dark
groping
course
of
humanity
s
childhood
human
beings
have
given
to
the
most
important
of
all
question
what
is
man
i
have
said
that
the
answers
no
matter
how
sincere
no
matter
how
honestly
arrived
at
are
erroneous
false
to
fact
and
monstrous
i
have
said
and
i
repeat
that
the
misconceptions
involved
in
them
have
done
more
throughout
the
centuries
and
are
doing
more
than
all
other
hindering
causes
to
hamper
and
thwart
the
activity
of
the
energies
of
man
and
thus
to
retard
the
progress
of
civilization
it
is
not
merely
our
privilege
it
is
our
high
and
solemn
duty
to
examine
them
to
perform
the
great
duty
is
not
an
easy
task
the
misconceptions
in
question
have
come
down
to
us
from
remote
antiquity
they
have
not
come
down
singly
separately
clear
and
they
have
come
in
the
complicated
mesh
of
traditional
opinions
and
creeds
that
constitute
the
vulgar
philosophy
mental
our
time
if
we
are
to
perform
the
duty
of
examining
them
we
have
first
of
all
to
draw
them
forth
to
disengage
them
from
our
inherited
tangle
of
beliefs
and
frame
them
in
suitable
words
we
have
next
to
bring
ourselves
to
realize
vividly
and
keenly
that
the
conceptions
thus
disentangled
and
framed
are
in
fact
whether
they
be
true
or
false
at
the
very
heart
of
the
social
philosophy
of
the
world
we
have
in
the
third
place
to
detect
the
fundamental
character
of
the
blunder
involved
in
see
clearly
and
coldly
wherein
they
are
wrong
and
why
they
are
ruinous
we
have
finally
to
trace
if
we
can
their
deadly
effects
both
in
the
course
of
human
history
and
in
the
present
status
of
our
human
world
the
task
of
disengaging
the
two
monstrous
misconceptions
from
the
tangled
skein
of
inherited
beliefs
and
framing
them
in
words
i
have
already
repeatedly
performed
let
us
keep
the
results
in
mind
here
they
are
in
their
nakedness
human
women
and
animals
and
so
they
are
natural
human
beings
are
neither
natural
nor
neither
wholly
animal
nor
wholly
divine
but
are
natural
and
sort
of
mysterious
hybrid
compound
of
brute
and
gods
the
second
part
of
our
is
the
reader
s
task
as
much
as
not
so
easy
and
the
reason
is
evident
it
is
this
the
false
creeds
in
fatal
misconceptions
they
so
to
have
been
so
long
and
so
deeply
imbedded
in
our
thought
and
speech
and
ways
of
have
been
so
thoroughly
in
them
by
home
and
school
and
church
and
we
and
take
them
for
granted
and
have
to
be
virtually
into
an
awareness
of
the
fact
that
we
do
actually
hold
them
and
that
they
do
actually
reign
throughout
the
world
and
have
so
reigned
from
time
immemorial
we
have
therefore
to
shake
ourselves
awake
to
ourselves
into
a
realization
of
the
truth
i
assume
that
the
reader
is
at
once
rational
i
mean
and
interested
in
the
welfare
of
mankind
if
he
is
not
he
will
not
be
a
reader
of
this
book
he
therefore
knows
that
the
third
task
of
detecting
and
exposing
the
fundamental
error
of
the
misconceptions
in
a
task
of
the
utmost
importance
what
is
that
error
it
is
i
have
said
an
error
in
logic
but
logical
errors
are
not
all
are
of
many
kinds
what
is
the
kind
of
one
it
is
the
kind
that
consists
in
what
mathematicians
call
confusion
of
types
or
mixing
of
the
answer
can
not
be
made
too
clear
nor
too
emphatic
for
its
importance
in
the
criticism
of
our
thinking
is
great
beyond
measure
there
are
millions
of
examples
that
help
to
make
the
matter
clear
i
will
again
employ
the
simplest
of
so
simple
that
a
child
can
understand
it
it
is
a
mathematical
example
as
it
ought
to
be
for
the
whole
question
of
logical
types
or
dimensions
is
a
mathematical
one
i
beg
the
reader
not
to
shy
at
or
run
away
from
the
mere
word
mathematical
for
although
most
of
us
have
but
little
mathematical
we
all
of
us
have
the
mathematical
for
else
we
should
not
be
are
all
of
us
mathematicians
let
us
then
proceed
confidently
and
at
once
to
our
simple
example
here
is
a
say
a
surface
it
has
length
and
so
it
has
we
say
dimensions
next
consider
a
say
a
it
has
length
breadth
and
so
has
we
say
dimensions
now
we
notice
that
the
cube
surfaces
and
so
certain
surface
do
we
therefore
say
that
a
solid
a
surface
that
the
cube
is
a
member
of
the
class
of
surfaces
if
we
did
we
should
be
fools
that
is
evident
or
suppose
we
notice
that
solids
have
certain
properties
and
certain
properties
that
surfaces
do
have
and
suppose
we
say
the
properties
of
solids
are
but
the
other
properties
are
so
mysterious
that
they
must
be
or
somehow
divine
and
suppose
we
then
say
that
solids
are
unions
mixtures
compounds
or
hybrids
of
surfaces
and
something
divine
or
is
it
not
evident
that
if
we
did
that
we
should
be
again
blundering
like
fools
fools
fools
that
such
would
be
the
case
any
one
can
see
let
us
now
consider
animals
and
human
beings
and
let
us
look
squarely
and
candidly
at
the
facts
to
get
a
start
think
for
a
moment
of
plants
plants
are
living
things
they
take
transform
and
appropriate
the
energies
of
sun
soil
and
air
but
they
have
the
power
to
move
about
in
space
we
may
say
that
plants
constitute
the
lowest
order
or
class
or
type
or
dimension
of
dimension
plants
we
see
are
binders
of
the
energies
of
the
world
what
of
animals
like
the
plants
animals
too
take
in
transform
and
appropriate
the
energies
of
sun
soil
and
air
though
in
large
part
they
take
them
in
forms
already
prepared
by
the
plants
themselves
but
the
plants
animals
possess
the
power
to
move
about
in
creep
or
crawl
or
run
or
swim
or
is
thus
evident
that
compared
with
plants
animals
belong
to
a
higher
order
or
higher
class
or
higher
type
or
higher
dimension
of
life
we
may
therefore
say
that
the
type
of
animal
life
is
a
type
of
type
i
have
called
them
because
they
are
distinguished
or
marked
by
their
autonomous
power
to
move
about
in
space
to
abandon
one
place
and
occupy
another
and
so
to
appropriate
the
natural
fruits
of
many
localities
the
life
of
animals
is
thus
a
in
a
sense
evidently
not
applicable
to
plants
and
now
what
shall
we
say
of
like
the
animals
human
beings
have
indeed
the
power
of
autonomous
power
to
capacity
for
binding
space
and
it
is
obvious
that
if
they
possessed
no
capacity
of
higher
order
men
women
and
children
would
indeed
be
animals
but
what
are
the
facts
the
facts
if
we
will
but
note
them
and
reflect
upon
them
are
such
as
to
show
us
that
the
chasm
separating
human
nature
from
animal
nature
is
even
wider
and
deeper
than
the
chasm
between
animal
life
and
the
life
of
plants
for
man
improves
animals
do
not
man
progresses
animals
do
not
man
invents
more
and
more
complicated
tools
animals
do
not
man
is
a
creator
of
material
and
spiritual
wealth
animals
are
not
man
is
a
builder
of
civilization
animals
are
not
man
makes
the
live
in
the
present
and
the
present
in
the
animals
do
not
man
is
thus
a
of
animals
are
not
in
the
light
of
such
considerations
if
only
we
will
attend
to
their
mighty
significance
it
is
as
clear
as
anything
can
be
or
can
become
that
the
life
of
as
radically
distinct
from
that
of
animal
life
is
distinct
from
that
of
plants
or
as
the
nature
of
a
solid
is
distinct
from
that
of
a
surface
or
that
of
a
surface
from
that
of
a
line
it
is
therefore
perfectly
manifest
that
when
we
regard
human
beings
as
animals
or
as
mixtures
of
animal
nature
with
something
mysteriously
we
are
guilty
of
the
same
of
blunder
as
if
we
regarded
animals
as
plants
or
as
plants
touched
by
divinity
same
of
blunder
as
that
of
regarding
a
solid
as
a
surface
or
as
a
surface
miraculously
transfigured
by
some
mysterious
influence
from
outside
the
universe
of
space
it
is
thus
evident
that
our
guilt
in
the
matter
is
the
guilt
of
a
blunder
that
is
confusing
of
types
a
mixing
of
dimensions
nothing
can
be
more
disastrous
for
what
are
the
consequences
of
that
kind
of
error
let
the
reader
reflect
he
knows
that
if
our
ancestors
had
committed
that
kind
of
error
regarding
lines
and
surfaces
and
solids
there
would
be
no
science
of
geometry
and
he
knows
that
if
there
were
no
geometry
there
would
be
no
architecture
in
the
world
no
surveying
no
railroads
no
astronomy
no
charting
of
the
seas
no
steamships
no
engineering
nothing
whatever
of
the
now
familiar
affairs
made
possible
by
the
scientific
conquest
of
space
i
say
again
let
the
reader
reflect
for
if
he
does
not
he
will
here
miss
the
gravity
of
a
most
momentous
truth
he
readily
sees
in
the
case
supposed
how
very
appalling
the
consequences
would
have
been
if
throughout
the
period
of
humanity
s
childhood
there
had
occurred
a
certain
confusion
of
types
a
certain
mixing
of
dimensions
and
he
is
to
see
it
just
because
happily
the
blunder
was
made
or
if
made
was
not
persisted
in
for
if
it
had
been
made
and
persisted
in
then
the
great
and
now
familiar
things
of
which
it
would
have
deprived
the
world
would
not
be
here
we
should
not
now
be
able
even
to
imagine
them
and
so
we
could
not
now
compute
even
roughly
the
tremendous
magnitude
of
the
blunder
s
disastrous
consequences
let
the
reader
not
deviate
nor
falter
nor
stagger
here
let
him
shoulder
the
burden
of
the
mighty
argument
and
bear
it
to
the
goal
he
easily
perceives
the
truly
appalling
consequences
that
have
inevitably
followed
from
the
error
of
confusing
error
of
mixing
the
matter
of
lines
and
surfaces
and
solids
that
error
had
been
committed
and
persisted
in
throughout
the
centuries
he
perceive
those
consequences
just
because
the
error
was
made
and
hence
the
great
things
of
which
had
the
blunder
been
made
it
would
have
deprived
the
world
are
here
so
that
he
can
say
behold
those
splendid
science
of
geometry
and
its
manifold
applications
everywhere
shining
in
human
all
of
them
gone
imagine
the
world
if
they
had
never
been
and
you
will
have
a
measure
of
the
consequences
that
would
have
followed
violation
of
the
law
of
types
the
law
of
dimensions
in
the
matter
of
lines
surfaces
and
but
now
in
regard
to
the
exactly
similar
error
respecting
the
nature
of
man
the
situation
is
reversed
for
this
blunder
unlike
the
other
one
is
not
merely
hypothetical
we
have
seen
that
it
was
actually
committed
and
has
been
actually
persisted
in
from
time
immemorial
not
merely
for
years
or
for
decades
or
for
centuries
but
for
of
including
our
own
day
it
has
lain
athwart
the
course
of
human
progress
age
after
age
it
has
hampered
and
baulked
the
natural
activity
of
the
humanity
how
are
we
to
estimate
its
consequences
let
the
reader
keep
in
mind
that
the
error
is
blunder
like
that
supposed
regarding
geometric
entities
let
him
reflect
moreover
that
it
affects
not
merely
one
of
our
human
concerns
but
of
them
since
it
is
an
error
regarding
the
of
them
the
very
of
man
himself
and
he
will
know
as
well
as
anything
can
be
known
that
the
consequences
of
the
blunder
have
been
and
are
very
momentous
and
very
terrible
their
measure
is
indeed
beyond
our
power
we
can
not
describe
them
adequately
we
can
not
delineate
their
proportions
for
we
can
not
truly
imagine
them
and
the
reason
is
plain
it
is
that
those
advancements
of
civilization
those
augmentations
of
material
and
spiritual
wealth
all
of
the
glorious
achievements
of
which
the
tragic
blunder
has
deprived
the
world
are
none
of
them
here
they
have
not
been
produced
and
so
we
can
not
say
as
in
the
other
case
look
upon
these
splendid
treasures
of
time
imagine
them
taken
away
and
your
sense
of
the
appalling
loss
will
give
you
the
measure
it
is
evident
that
the
glories
of
which
the
misconceptions
of
human
nature
have
deprived
manhood
must
long
remain
perhaps
forever
in
the
sad
realm
of
dreams
regarding
great
and
noble
things
that
might
have
been
i
have
said
that
the
duty
of
examining
the
misconceptions
imposes
upon
us
four
obligations
three
of
these
we
have
performed
we
have
disengaged
the
beliefs
in
question
from
the
complicated
tangle
of
opinions
in
which
they
have
come
down
to
us
from
remote
antiquity
we
have
recognized
the
necessity
and
the
duty
of
virtually
stinging
ourselves
into
an
awareness
of
the
fact
that
we
have
actually
held
them
for
true
and
that
from
time
immemorial
they
have
poured
their
virus
into
the
heart
of
ethics
economics
politics
and
government
throughout
the
world
we
have
seen
not
only
that
the
beliefs
are
false
but
that
their
falseness
is
due
to
a
blunder
of
the
most
fundamental
blunder
of
mixing
dimensions
or
confusing
types
as
already
said
the
fourth
one
of
the
mentioned
tasks
is
that
of
tracing
if
we
can
the
blunder
s
deadly
effects
both
in
human
history
and
in
the
present
status
of
the
world
we
have
just
reached
the
conclusion
that
this
task
can
not
be
performed
for
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
we
have
seen
that
if
the
blunder
had
not
been
committed
and
persisted
in
the
world
would
now
possess
a
civilization
so
far
advanced
so
rich
in
the
spiritual
fruits
of
time
and
toil
as
to
be
utterly
beyond
our
present
power
to
conceive
or
imagine
it
but
though
we
can
not
perform
the
task
fully
our
plight
is
far
from
hopeless
the
world
war
has
goaded
us
into
thinking
as
we
never
thought
before
it
has
constrained
us
to
think
of
realities
and
especially
to
think
of
the
supreme
reality
of
man
that
is
why
the
great
catastrophe
marks
the
close
of
humanity
s
childhood
the
period
has
been
long
and
the
manner
of
its
end
is
memorable
sudden
flaming
cataclysmic
demonstration
of
fundamental
ignorance
of
human
nature
it
is
just
that
tragic
brutal
as
an
earthquake
pitiless
as
fate
or
famine
that
gives
us
ground
for
future
hope
it
has
forced
us
to
think
of
realities
and
it
is
thought
of
reality
that
will
heal
the
world
and
so
i
say
that
these
days
despite
their
fear
and
gloom
are
the
beginning
of
a
new
order
in
human
order
of
permanent
peace
and
swift
advancement
of
human
weal
for
we
know
at
length
what
human
beings
are
and
the
knowledge
can
be
taught
to
men
and
women
and
children
by
home
and
school
and
church
and
press
throughout
the
world
we
know
at
length
and
we
can
teach
the
world
that
man
is
neither
an
animal
nor
a
miraculous
mixture
of
angel
and
beast
we
know
at
length
and
we
can
teach
that
throughout
the
centuries
these
monstrous
misconceptions
have
made
countless
millions
mourn
and
that
they
are
doing
so
for
though
we
can
not
compute
the
of
which
they
have
mankind
we
can
trace
the
dark
ramifications
of
their
positive
in
a
thousand
ways
we
know
at
length
and
we
can
teach
that
man
though
he
is
not
an
animal
is
a
natural
being
having
a
definite
place
a
rank
of
his
own
in
the
hierarchy
of
natural
life
we
know
at
length
and
we
can
teach
the
world
that
what
is
of
the
human
class
of
which
makes
us
the
power
to
create
material
and
spiritual
beget
the
light
of
reasoned
produce
is
the
unique
capacity
of
man
for
binding
time
uniting
past
present
and
future
in
a
growing
charged
at
once
with
the
surviving
creations
of
the
dead
with
the
productive
labor
of
the
living
with
the
rights
and
hopes
of
the
yet
unborn
we
know
at
length
and
we
can
teach
that
the
rate
of
human
progress
is
the
rate
of
a
swiftly
increasing
exponential
function
of
time
we
know
and
we
can
teach
that
what
is
good
in
that
is
precious
in
it
sacred
and
the
fruit
of
the
toil
struggling
blindly
through
the
ages
against
the
perpetual
barrier
of
human
ignorance
of
human
nature
we
know
at
length
we
can
teach
and
the
world
will
understand
that
in
proportion
as
we
rid
our
ethics
and
social
philosophy
of
monstrous
misrepresentations
of
human
nature
the
energies
of
humanity
will
advance
civilization
in
accordance
with
their
natural
law
the
function
of
time
such
knowledge
and
such
teaching
will
inaugurate
the
period
of
humanity
s
manhood
it
can
be
made
an
endless
period
of
rapid
developments
in
true
civilization
all
the
developments
must
grow
out
of
the
true
conception
of
human
beings
as
constituting
the
class
of
life
and
so
the
work
must
begin
with
a
campaign
of
education
wide
enough
to
embrace
the
world
the
cooperation
of
all
educational
home
the
school
the
church
the
be
enlisted
to
make
known
the
fundamental
truth
concerning
the
nature
of
man
so
that
it
shall
become
the
guiding
and
of
men
women
and
children
everywhere
gradual
indeed
but
profound
will
be
the
transformations
wrought
in
all
the
affairs
of
mankind
but
especially
and
first
of
all
in
the
arts
and
sciences
of
ethics
economics
politics
and
government
the
ethics
of
humanity
s
manhood
will
be
neither
animal
ethics
nor
ethics
it
will
be
a
natural
ethics
based
upon
a
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
human
nature
it
will
not
be
a
branch
of
zoology
the
ethics
of
tooth
and
claw
the
ethics
of
profiteering
the
ethics
of
beasts
fighting
for
a
place
in
the
it
will
be
a
branch
of
humanology
a
branch
of
human
engineering
it
will
be
a
ethics
the
ethics
of
the
entirely
natural
energies
of
humanity
whatever
accords
with
the
natural
activity
of
those
energies
will
be
and
whatever
does
not
will
be
and
survival
of
the
fittest
in
the
sense
of
the
is
a
standard
the
ethical
standard
of
beasts
in
the
ethics
of
humanity
s
manhood
survival
of
the
fittest
will
mean
survival
of
the
in
competitions
for
excellence
and
excellence
will
mean
in
the
production
and
right
use
of
material
and
spiritual
in
science
in
art
in
wisdom
in
justice
in
promoting
the
weal
and
protecting
the
rights
both
of
the
living
and
of
the
unborn
the
ethics
that
arose
in
the
dark
period
of
humanity
s
childhood
from
the
conception
of
human
beings
as
mysterious
unions
of
animality
and
divinity
gave
birth
to
two
repulsive
species
of
in
men
regarded
as
animals
fit
to
be
slaves
and
traffic
in
the
supernatural
in
the
sale
of
indulgences
in
one
form
or
another
and
the
divine
wisdom
of
ignorant
priests
it
is
needless
to
say
that
in
the
natural
ethics
of
humanity
s
manhood
those
species
of
commerce
will
not
be
found
and
what
shall
we
say
in
particular
of
economics
of
industry
business
as
usual
and
the
finance
of
normalcy
there
lies
before
me
an
established
handbook
of
by
mead
appleton
n
y
whose
purpose
is
not
that
of
adverse
criticism
but
is
that
of
showing
the
generally
accepted
sound
bases
for
prosperous
business
i
can
hardly
do
better
than
to
ask
the
reader
to
ponder
a
few
extracts
from
that
work
showing
the
established
and
amazing
theories
for
then
i
have
only
to
say
that
in
the
period
of
humanity
s
manhood
the
moral
blindness
of
such
principles
their
spirit
of
calculating
selfishness
and
greed
will
be
regarded
with
utter
loathing
as
slavery
is
regarded
behold
the
picture
since
the
bondholder
is
solely
interested
in
the
security
of
his
principal
and
regular
payment
of
his
interest
and
since
both
security
and
interest
depend
upon
the
permanence
of
income
other
things
being
equal
the
companies
with
the
most
stable
earnings
or
a
market
furnish
the
best
security
for
bonds
stability
of
earnings
depends
upon
the
possession
of
a
monopoly
is
exclusive
or
dominant
control
over
a
market
the
more
complete
this
control
the
more
valuable
is
the
the
advantage
of
monopoly
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
prices
of
services
or
commodities
are
controlled
by
the
producers
rather
than
by
the
consumer
monopolies
are
of
various
origins
the
most
familiar
are
franchises
the
right
to
use
for
for
example
the
furnishing
of
light
water
and
transportation
of
sources
of
raw
patents
high
cost
of
duplicating
plant
in
manufacturing
industries
for
example
those
enterprises
which
raw
and
the
of
have
a
more
stable
demand
railroads
furnish
perhaps
the
best
basis
of
bond
issue
because
of
the
stability
of
the
demand
for
the
transportation
service
the
high
cost
of
duplicating
the
railroad
plant
enables
them
to
fix
their
rates
on
freight
and
passenger
traffic
the
security
of
the
creditors
is
here
the
profitableness
of
the
business
is
carried
on
in
the
furthermore
a
business
is
not
an
aggregate
of
physical
property
but
consists
of
physical
boilers
machine
an
industrial
opportunity
plus
the
organization
and
ability
to
operate

comment
would
be
superfluous
in
the
period
of
humanity
s
manhood
the
science
of
economics
the
dismal
science
of
political
economy
will
become
a
genuine
science
based
upon
the
laws
of
the
energies
of

it
will
become
the
light
of
human
guardian
and
guide
of
human
weal
for
it
will
discover
and
will
teach
that
a
life
a
life
is
not
merely
a
life
but
a
life
it
will
know
and
will
teach
that
a
civilizing
life
is
a
life
devoted
to
the
production
of
potential
and
kinetic
the
creation
that
is
of
material

spiritual
wealth
it
will
know
and
will
teach
that
material
and
spiritual
a
natural
of
the
marriage
of
time
and
human
toil
it
will

will
teach
that
the
wealth
in
the
world
at
any
given
moment
is
almost
wholly
the
fruit
of
time
and
the
labor
of
the

and
so
it
will
ask
to
whom
does
the
inheritance
rightly
belong
does
it
of
right
belong
to
smith
and
brown
if
so
or
does
it

if
so
and
what
does
humanity
include

the

are
relatively

both

the

not

ask
these
questions
but
it
will
answer
them
and
answer
them
aright
in
seeking
the
answers
it
will
discover
some
obvious
truths
and
many
old
words
will
acquire
new
meanings
consistent
with
the
nature
of
man
it
will
discover
and
will
teach
that
the
of
a
given
generation
are
and
at
of
the
dead
ancestry
of
all
the
generations
to
come
it
will
discover

will
teach
that
in
this
double
relationship
uniting
past
and
future
in
a
single
living
growing
reality
are
to
be
found
the
obligations
of
ethics
and
the

authority
economics
will

of

and
dead
men

toil
animals
inherit
the
wild
fruits
of
the
earth
to
fight
about
them
and
to
devour
but
only
as
for
the
generations
to
come
it
will

will
teach
that
capitalistic
lust
to
for
self
and
proletarian
lust
to
for
self
are
both
of
them
the
level
of
life
the
economics
of

s
manhood
will

the
peaceful
energies
of
inventive
mind
of
growing
knowledge
and
understanding
and
skill
and
light
it
will

that
these
energies
of
existing
men
united
with
one
billion
six
hundred
million
available
powers
united
with
the
ten
billion
living
of
the
dead
if
they
be
not
wasted
by
ignorance
and
selfishness
by
conflict
and
competition
characteristic
of
beasts
are
more
than
sufficient
to
produce
a
high
order
of
increasing
prosperity
everywhere
throughout
the
world
in
the
period
of
its
manhood
economics
will
discover
and
will
teach
that
to
produce
world
prosperity
the
fighting
of
man
against
the
peaceful
cooperation
of
all
is
both
and
sufficient
it
will
know
and
will
teach
that
such
cooperation
demands
leadership
and
a
common
it
will
know
however
and
will
teach
for
the
lesson
of
germany
is
plain
that
scientific
knowledge
and
a
common
aim
are
not
alone
sufficient
it
will
know
and
teach
and
all
will
understand
that
the
common
aim
the
unifying
principle
the
basis
of
cooperation
can
not
be
the
welfare
of
a
family
nor
that
of
a
province
or
a
state
or
a
race
but
must
be
the
welfare
of
mankind
the
prosperity
of
humanity
the
weal
of
the
peaceful
production
of
wealth
without
the
destruction
of
war
in
humanity

manhood
love

the

your

and
mine
will
be
the
human
cooperative
commonwealth
of
democracy
in

not
merely
in

it
will
be
a
natural
organic
embodiment
of
the
civilizing
of
the
human
class
of
life
its
larger
affairs
will
be
guided
by
the
science

of
human
by

politicians
by
scientific
men
by
honest
men
who
is
it
a

it
a
dream
but
the
dream
will
come
true
it
is
a
scientific

and
science
will
make
it
a

reality
how
is
the
thing
to
be
done
no
one
can

the
details
but
in

outline
the
process
is
clear
violence
is
to
be
avoided
there
must
be
a
period
of
period
of
adjustment
a
natural
first
step
would
probably
be
the
establishment
of
a
new
institution
which
might
be
called
a
dynamic
of
coordination
or
a
department
of
name
is
of
little
importance
but
it
would
be
the
of
the
new
civilization
its
functions
would
be
those
of
encouraging
helping
and
protecting
the
people
in
such
cooperative
enterprises
as
agriculture
manufactures
finance
and
distribution
the
department

at

one
sociologist
one
biologist
one

work
would

would
be
selected

fixed
by
the
section
of
mathematical
composed
of
say
one
lawyer
one

one
mechanical

selected
as

their
task
would
be
to
recommend

provide
means
for
eliminating
legalism
from
the
theory
and
practice
of
law
and
to
bring
jurisprudence
into
accord
with
the
laws
of
human
nature
and
the
changing
needs
of
human
society
their
legislative
proposals
if
ratified
in
a
joint
session
of
sections
and
would
then
be
recommended
to
the
appropriate
legislative
bodies
educational
composed
of
two
or
three
teachers
one
sociologist
one
mechanical
engineer
one
mathematician
selected
as
above
they
would
elaborate
educational
projects
and
revise
school
methods
and
books

decisions
being
subject
to
the
approval
of

those
plans
would
be
published
and
no
private
person
but
only
cooperative

would
be
permitted
by

to

them
the

respecting
the
general

such

that

is
to
accentuate

in

we
know
that
an
age
is
dying
here
it
would
be
easy
to
miss
the
signs
of
coming

but
i
have
little
doubt
that
it
will
come
a
realization
of
the
of
life
lived
to
labor
and
to
die
having
achieved
nothing
but
avoidance

i
said
in
the
beginning
that
this
little
book
has
aimed
to
be
only
a
sketch
the
problem
of
life
is
old
i
have
endeavored
to
approach
it
afresh
with
a
new
method
in
a
new
spirit
from
a
new
point
of
view
the
literature
of
the
subject
is
vast
it
displays
great
knowledge
and
skill
much
of
it
is
fitted
to
inform
and
to
inspire
such
as
really
read
with
a
genuine
desire
to
understand
its
weakness
is
due
to
the
absence
of
a
true
conception
of
what
human
beings
are
that
is
what
i
miss
in
it
and
it
is
that
lack
of
fundamental
and
central
thought
that
i
have
striven
to
supply
if
i
have
succeeded
in
that
i
have
no
else
will
follow
quickly
inevitably
as
a
matter
of
course
for
a
fundamental
conception
once
it
is
formed
and
expressed
has
a
strange
power
of
enlisting
the
thought
and
cooperation
of
many
minds
and
no
conception
can
have
greater
power
in
our
human
world
than
a
conception
of
the
nature
of
man
for
that
most
important
of
truths
the
times
are
ripe
the
world
is
filled
with
the
saddest
of
memories
with
gloom
forebodings
and
fear
without
the
truth
in
this
matter
there
can
be
no
rational
must
go
on
in
its
dismal
course
but
the
truth
there
is
not
only
hope
but
certitude
that
the
old
order
has
passed
and
that
humanity
s
manhood
dates
from
the
present
day
that
i
have
here
presented
the
truth
in
this
true
conception
of
the
human
class
of
have
personally
no
doubt
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
that
conception
is
to
be
the
base
the
guide
the
source
of
light
of
a
new
civilization
whether
i
am
mistaken
or
not
time
will
decide
i
feel
as
buckle
felt
in
writing
his
of
whether
or
not
i
have
effected
anything
of
real
value
is
a
question
for
competent
judges
to
decide
of
this
at
least
i
feel
certain
that
whatever
imperfections
may
be
observed
the
fault
consists
not
in
the
method
proposed
but
in
the
extreme
difficulty
of
any
single
man
putting
into
full
operation
all
the
parts
of
so
vast
a
scheme
it
is
on
this
point
and
on
this
alone
that
i
feel
the
need
of
great
indulgence
but
as
to
the
plan
itself
i
have
no
misgivings
of
defects
in
its
execution
i
am
not
unconscious
i
can
only
plead
the
immensity
of
the
subject
the
shortness
of
a
single
life
and
the
imperfection
of
every
single
enterprise
i
therefore
wish
this
work
to
be
estimated
not
according
to
the
finish
of
its
separate
parts
but
according
to
the
way
in
which
those
parts
have
been
fused
into
a
complete
and
symmetrical
whole
this
in
an
undertaking
of
such
novelty
and
magnitude
i
have
a
right
to
expect
and
i
would
moreover
add
that
if
the
reader
has
met
with
opinions
adverse
to
his
own
he
should
remember
that
his
views
are
perhaps
the
same
as
those
which
i
too
once
held
and
which
i
have
abandoned
because
after
a
wider
range
of
study
i
found
them
unsupported
by
solid
proof
subversive
of
the
interest
of
man
and
fatal
to
the
progress
of
his
knowledge
to
examine
the
notions
in
which
we
have
been
educated
and
to
turn
aside
from
those
which
will
not
bear
the
test
is
a
task
so
painful
that
they
who
shrink
from
the
sufferings
should
pause
before
they
reproach
those
by
whom
the
suffering
is
undergone
conclusions
arrived
at
in
this
way
are
not
to
be
overturned
by
stating
that
they
endanger
some
other
conclusions
nor
can
they
be
even
affected
by
allegation
against
their
supposed
tendency
the
principles
which
i
advocate
are
based
upon
distinct
arguments
supported
by
well
ascertained
facts
the
only
points
therefore
to
be
ascertained
are
whether
the
arguments
are
fair
and
whether
the
facts
are
certain
if
these
two
conditions
have
been
obeyed
the
principles
follow
by
an
inevitable
and
why
have
i
sought
throughout
to
follow
the
spirit
of
mathematics
because
i
have
been
dealing
with
ideas
and
have
desired
above
all
things
else
to
be
right
and
clear
ideas
have
a
character
of
their
are
right
or
wrong
independently
of
our
hopes
and
passions
and
will
in
the
connection
of
ideas
there
is
an
unbreakable
thread
of
destiny
that
is
why
in
his
professor
keyser
has
truly
said
mathematics
is
the
study
of
fate
in
a
physical
sense
but
in
the
sense
of
the
binding
thread
that
connects
thought
with
thought
and
conclusions
with
their
premises
where
then
is
our
freedom
what
do
you
love
painting
poetry
music
the
muses
are
fates
whoso
loves
them
is
free
logic
is
the
muse
of
no
doubt
mathematics
is
truly
impersonal
in
method
too
impersonal
maybe
to
please
the
sentimentalists
before
they
take
the
time
to
think
mathematical
analysis
of
life
phenomena
elevates
our
point
of
view
above
passion
above
selfishness
in
any
form
and
therefore
it
is
the
only
method
which
can
tell
us
genuine
truths
about
ourselves
spinosa
even
in
the
century
had
well
realized
this
fact
and
although
imperfect
in
many
ways
his
was
an
effort
in
the
right
direction
and
this
quoted
conclusion
may
well
be
a
conclusion
for
ourselves
in
the
century
the
truth
might
forever
have
remained
hid
from
the
human
race
if
mathematics
which
looks
not
to
the
final
cause
of
figures
but
to
their
essential
nature
and
the
properties
involved
in
it
had
not
set
another
type
of
knowledge
before
them
when
i
turned
my
mind
to
this
subject
i
did
not
propose
to
myself
any
novel
or
strange
aim
but
simply
to
demonstrate
by
certain
and
indubitable
reason
those
things
which
agree
best
with
practice
and
in
order
that
i
might
enquire
into
the
matters
of
the
science
with
the
same
freedom
of
mind
with
which
we
are
wont
to
treat
lines
and
surfaces
in
mathematics
i
determined
not
to
laugh
or
to
weep
over
the
actions
of
men
but
simply
to
understand
them
and
to
contemplate
their
affections
and
passions
such
as
love
hate
anger
envy
arrogance
pity
and
all
other
disturbances
of
soul
not
as
vices
of
human
nature
but
as
properties
pertaining
to
it
in
the
same
way
as
heat
cold
storm
thunder
pertain
to
the
nature
of
the
atmosphere
for
these
though
troublesome
are
yet
necessary
and
have
certain
causes
through
which
we
may
come
to
understand
them
and
thus
by
contemplating
them
in
their
truth
gain
for
our
minds
much
joy
as
by
the
knowledge
of
things
that
are
pleasing
to
the
if
only
this
little
book
will
the
scientific
study
of
man
i
shall
be
happy
for
then
we
may
confidently
expect
a
science
and
art
that
will
know
how
to
direct
the
energies
of
man
to
the
advancement
of
human
weal
what
else
many
topics
have
not
even
been
broached
may
it
not
achieve
in
course
of
the
aeons
to
come
what
light
may
it
not
yet
throw
upon
such
fundamental
phenomena
as
and
so
on
what
if
any
are
the
limits
of
in
it
are
somehow
involved
all
the
higher
functions
of
mind
is
time
identical
with
intelligence
is
either
of
them
the
other
s
cause
is
time
the
cosmos
or
is
the
latter
in
the
former
is
the
cosmos
intelligent
many
no
doubt
and
marvelous
are
the
fields
which
the
scientific
study
of
man
will
open
for
research
appendix
i
mathematics
and
the
purpose
of
this
appendix
is
to
give
an
expression
of
some
new
ideas
which
evolve
directly
out
of
the
fact
that
humans
are
and
which
may
serve
as
suggestions
for
the
foundation
of
the
problem
is
of
exceeding
difficulty
to
give
expression
to
in
any
form
and
therefore
much
more
difficult
to
express
in
any
exact
or
correct
form
and
so
i
beg
the
reader
s
patience
in
regard
to
the
language
because
some
of
the
ideas
are
in
themselves
correct
and
sometimes
very
suggestive
in
spite
of
the
language
used
i
am
particularly
interested
that
mathematicians
physicists
and
metaphysicians
should
read
it
carefully
forgive
me
the
form
and
look
into
the
suggestions
because
scientific
psychology
if
such
a
science
is
to
exist
would
by
necessity
have
to
be
a
branch
of
physics
i
particularly
beg
the
mathematicians
and
physicists
not
to
discard
this
appendix
with
too
hasty
a
judgment
of
oh
metaphysics
and
also
the
metaphysicians
not
to
do
the
same
with
an
equally
hasty
judgment
oh
i
hope
that
if
this
appendix
is
sympathetically
understood
mathematicians
and
physicists
will
be
moved
to
investigate
the
problem
if
mathematicians
and
physicists
would
be
more
tolerant
toward
metaphysics
and
if
metaphysicians
would
be
moved
to
study
mathematics
both
would
find
tremendous
fields
to
work
in
some
scientists
are
very
pedantic
and
therefore
intolerant
in
their
pedantry
and
they
may
say
the
fellow
should
learn
first
how
to
express
himself
and
then
ask
our
my
answer
is
that
the
problems
involved
are
too
pressing
too
vital
too
fundamental
for
humankind
to
permit
me
to
delay
for
perhaps
long
years
before
i
shall
be
able
to
present
the
subject
in
a
correct
and
satisfactory
form
and
also
that
the
problems
involved
cover
too
vast
a
field
for
a
single
man
to
work
it
conclusively
it
seems
best
to
give
the
new
ideas
to
the
public
in
a
suggestive
form
so
that
many
people
may
be
led
to
work
on
them
more
fully
the
old
word
metaphysics
is
an
illegitimate
child
of
ignorance
and
an
unnecessary
word
in
the
scientific
study
of
nature
every
phenomenon
of
nature
can
be
classed
and
studied
in
physics
or
chemistry
or
mathematics
the
problem
therefore
is
not
in
any
way
or
but
belongs
rather
to
an
unknown
or
an
undeveloped
branch
of
physics
the
problem
therefore
may
be
not
that
of
some
science
but
rather
that
of
a
new
branch
of
mathematics
or
physics
or
chemistry
or
all
combined
it
is
pathetic
that
only
after
many
aeons
of
human
existence
the
dimensionality
of
man
has
been
discovered
and
his
proper
status
in
has
been
given
by
the
definition
of
the
old
metaphysics
in
spite
of
its
being
far
from
exact
accomplished
a
great
deal
what
prevented
metaphysics
from
achieving
more
was
its
use
of
unmathematical
method
or
to
be
more
explicit
its
failure
to
understand
the
importance
of
dimensions
metaphysics
used
words
and
conceptions
of
meanings
which
of
necessity
resulted
in
hopeless
confusion
in
a
talking
about
words
in
mere
verbalism
an
example
will
serve
to
make
this
clear
if
we
were
to
speak
of
a
cow
a
man
an
automobile
and
a
locomotive
as
pullers
and
if
we
were
not
to
use
any
other
names
in
connection
with
them
what
would
happen
if
we
characterized
these
things
or
beings
by
one
common
characteristic
namely
to
pull
havoc
would
be
introduced
into
our
conceptions
and
in
practical
life
we
would
try
to
milk
an
automobile
or
we
would
try
to
extract
gasoline
from
a
cow
or
look
for
a
screw
in
a
man
or
we
would
speculate
about
any
or
all
of
these
things
too
obviously
exactly
the
same
thing
happens
in
a
much
more
subtle
way
when
we
use
such
words
as
life
in
a
crystal
or
memory
in
animals
we
are
thus
mentally
making
a
mistake
no
less
nonsensical
than
the
talk
of
milking
an
automobile
would
be
laymen
are
baffled
by
the
word
dimension
they
imagine
that
dimensions
are
applicable
only
to
space
which
is
three
dimensional
but
they
are
mistaken
a
moving
object
is
is
it
has
three
dimensions
as
any
object
at
rest
but
when
the
object
is
moving
a
fourth
dimension
is
necessary
to
give
its
at
any
one
instant
we
see
therefore
that
a
moving
body
has
four
dimensions
and
so
on
as
a
matter
of
fact
scientific
psychology
will
very
much
need
mathematics
but
a
special
mathematics
can
this
be
produced
it
seems
to
me
that
it
can
it
is
a
well
known
fact
that
experimental
sciences
bring
us
to
face
facts
which
require
further
theoretical
elaboration
in
this
way
experimental
sciences
are
a
permanent
source
of
inspiration
to
mathematicians
because
new
facts
bring
about
the
need
of
new
methods
of
analysis
in
this
book
a
new
and
experimental
fact
has
been
disclosed
and
analysed
it
is
the
fact
that
humanity
is
a
class
of
life
where
the
capacity
or
the
energy
is
the
highest
function
of
humanity
including
all
the
mental
spiritual
will
powers
in
using
the
words
mental
spiritual
and
will
powers
i
deliberately
accept
and
use
them
in
the
popular
ordinary
sense
without
further
analysing
them
once
the
word
and
concept
enters
the
ground
for
analysis
and
reasoning
at
once
becomes
very
slippery
mathematicians
physicists
may
feel
that
the
expression
is
just
a
well
adapted
one
and
they
may
not
be
very
much
inclined
to
look
closer
into
it
or
attentively
to
analyse
it
theologians
and
metaphysicians
probably
will
speculate
a
great
deal
about
it
vaguely
with
undefined
terms
and
incoherent
ideas
with
incoherent
results
which
will
not
lead
us
toward
a
scientific
or
true
solution
but
will
keep
us
away
from
the
discovery
of
truth
in
the
meantime
two
facts
remain
facts
namely
mathematicians
and
physicists
have
almost
all
agreed
with
minkowski
that
space
by
itself
and
time
by
itself
are
mere
shadows
and
only
a
kind
of
blend
of
the
two
exists
in
its
own
the
other
that
exists
psychologically
by
itself
undefined
and
not
understood
one
chief
difficulty
is
always
that
humans
have
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
their
own
case
the
psychological
time
as
such
is
our
own
human
time
scientific
time
as
such
is
also
our
own
human
time
which
one
of
them
is
the
best
one
more
nearly
corresponds
to
the
truth
about
time
what
is
time
if
any
anyway
until
now
we
have
gone
from
cosmos
to
bios
from
bios
to
logos
now
we
are
confronted
with
the
fact
that
logos
are
dangerously
near
to
akin
to
each
other
or
may
be
identical
do
we
in
this
way
approach
or
go
back
to
cosmos
such
are
the
crucial
questions
which
arise
out
of
this
new
concept
of
man
one
fact
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
principles
of
dynamics
appeared
first
to
us
as
experimental
truths
but
we
have
been
obliged
to
use
them
as
definitions
it
is
by
definition
that
force
is
equal
to
the
product
of
mass
by
acceleration
or
that
action
is
equal
to
foundation
of
by
henri
poincaré
and
mathematics
also
has
its
whole
foundation
in
a
few
axioms
self
evident
but
it
must
be
noted
that
the
higher
or
highest
energies
of
man
one
of
its
branches
anyway
for
sake
of
discrimination
let
us
call
it
when
it
works
properly
that
is
mathematically
does
work
but
works
abstractly
the
higher
the
abstraction
the
less
there
is
of
the
psychological
element
and
the
more
there
is
so
to
say
of
the
pure
impersonal
energy
the
definition
of
a
man
as
a
definition
based
on
many
reflections
one
of
them
is
the
possibility
that
one
of
the
functions
of
the
energy
in
its
pure
form
in
the
highest
abstraction
works
as
it
were
shaping
the
product
of
its
activity
but
whether
is
another
matter
mathematics
does
not
presume
that
its
conclusions
are
true
but
it
does
assert
that
its
conclusions
are
correct
that
is
the
inestimable
value
of
mathematics
this
becomes
a
very
comprehensive
fact
if
we
approach
and
analyse
the
mathematical
processes
as
some
branch
of
the
process
which
they
are
then
this
process
at
once
becomes
impersonal
and
cosmic
because
of
the
involved
in
it
no
matter
what
is
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
time
is
the
succession
of
cosmos
bios
logos
taking
us
right
back
to
cosmos
again
now
if
we
put
axioms
into
the
apparatus
it
will
thrash
out
the
results
but
whether
the
results
are
is
another
question
to
be
able
to
talk
about
these
problems
i
have
to
introduce
three
new
definitions
which
are
introduced
only
for
practical
purposes
it
may
happen
that
after
some
rewording
these
definitions
may
become
scientific
i
will
try
to
define
truth
and
for
this
purpose
i
will
divide
the
concept
truth
into
three
types
psychological
or
private
or
relative
truth
by
which
i
will
mean
such
conceptions
of
the
truth
as
any
one
person
possesses
but
different
from
other
types
of
truth
αn
scientific
truth
αs
by
which
i
will
mean
a
psychological
truth
when
it
is
approved
by
the
faculties
or
apparatus
in
the
present
stage
of
our
development
this
scientific
truth
represents
the
in
our
present
knowledge
and
finally
the
absolute
truth
which
will
be
the
of
a
phenomenon
based
upon
the
final
knowledge
of
causation
valid
in
for
simplicity
s
sake
i
will
use
the
signs
αn
for
the
psychological
private
or
relative
truths
between
which
for
the
moment
i
will
not
discriminate
αsn
will
be
used
for
scientific
truths
and
finally
αinfinity
for
the
absolute
truth
valid
in
infinity
to
make
it
easier
to
explain
i
will
illustrate
the
suggestions
by
an
example
let
us
suppose
that
the
human
capacities
or
energies
in
the
chemistry
correspond
to
radium
in
the
chemistry
being
of
course
of
different
dimensions
and
of
absolutely
different
character
it
may
happen
for
it
probably
is
so
that
the
complex
energy
has
many
different
stages
of
development
and
different
kinds
of
rays
let
us
suppose
that
the
mental
capacities
are
the
rays
of
the
energy
the
spiritual
capacities
the
rays
the
will
powers
the
rays
and
so
on
psychological
truths
will
then
be
a
function
of
all
rays
together
namely
or
the
character
of
any
truth
in
question
will
largely
depend
upon
which
of
these
elements
prevail
if
it
were
possible
to
isolate
completely
from
the
other
rays
the
mental
logos
have
a
complete
abstraction
which
in
the
present
could
only
be
in
mathematics
then
the
work
of
could
be
compared
to
the
work
of
an
impersonal
machine
which
always
gives
the
same
shaped
product
matter
what
the
material
put
into
it
it
is
a
fact
that
mathematics
is
again
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
the
basic
axioms
which
underlie
mathematics
are
psychological
axioms
therefore
it
may
happen
that
these
axioms
are
not
of
the
αinfinity
type
but
are
of
the
personal
type
and
this
may
be
why
mathematics
can
not
account
for
psychological
facts
if
psychology
is
to
be
an
it
must
be
mathematical
in
principle
and
therefore
mathematics
must
find
a
way
to
embrace
psychology
here
i
will
endeavor
to
outline
a
way
in
which
this
can
be
done
to
express
it
correctly
is
more
than
difficult
i
beg
the
mathematical
reader
to
tolerate
the
form
and
look
for
the
sense
or
even
the
feelings
in
what
i
attempt
to
express
to
make
it
less
shocking
to
the
ear
of
the
pure
mathematician
i
will
use
for
the
infinitesimals
the
words
very
small
numbers
for
the
finite
the
words
normal
numbers
and
for
the
transfinite
the
words
very
great
instead
of
using
the
word
number
i
will
sometimes
use
the
word
magnitude
and
under
the
word
infinity
i
will
understand
the
meaning
as
the
base
of
the
whole
of
mathematics
or
rather
the
starting
point
of
mathematics
was
psychological
truths
axioms
concerning
normal
numbers
and
magnitudes
that
were
tangible
for
the
senses
here
to
my
mind
is
to
be
found
the
kernel
of
the
whole
trouble
the
of
mathematics
was
the
or
the
development
of
mathematics
is
this
is
the
reason
for
the
ghosts
in
the
background
of
mathematics
the
evolved
from
this
a
wonderful
abstract
theory
absolutely
correct
for
the
normal
the
very
small
and
for
the
very
great
numbers
but
the
rules
which
govern
the
small
numbers
the
normal
or
psychological
numbers
and
the
great
numbers
are
not
the
same
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
meantime
the
physical
world
the
psychological
world
is
composed
exclusively
of
very
great
numbers
and
of
very
small
magnitudes
atoms
electrons
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
want
really
to
understand
the
world
and
man
we
shall
have
to
start
from
the
beginning
from
then
take
the
next
very
small
number
as
the
first
or
normal
number
then
the
old
finites
or
the
normal
numbers
would
become
very
great
numbers
and
the
old
numbers
would
become
the
very
great
of
the
second
order
and
so
on
such
transposed
mathematics
would
become
psychological
and
philosophic
mathematics
and
mathematical
philosophy
would
become
philosophic
mathematics
the
immediate
and
most
vital
effect
would
be
that
the
would
be
made
not
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
magnitudes
but
from
the
beginning
or
from
the
limit
zero
from
the
the
intrinsic
to
be
or
not
to
be
the
next
to
it
would
be
the
very
first
small
magnitude
the
physical
and
therefore
psychological
continuum
i
use
the
words
physical
continuum
in
the
way
poincaré
used
them
would
become
a
mathematical
continuum
in
this
new
philosophic
mathematics
this
new
branch
of
philosophic
psychological
mathematics
would
be
absolutely
rigorous
correct
and
in
addition
to
which
maybe
it
would
change
or
enlarge
and
make
humanly
tangible
for
the
layman
the
concept
of
numbers
continuum
infinity
space
time
and
so
on
such
a
mathematics
would
be
the
mathematics
for
the
psychology
mathematical
philosophy
is
the
highest
philosophy
in
existence
nevertheless
it
could
be
changed
to
a
still
higher
order
in
the
way
indicated
here
and
become
philosophic
or
psychological
mathematics
this
new
science
of
course
would
not
change
the
ordinary
mathematics
for
ordinary
purposes
it
would
be
a
special
mathematics
for
the
study
of
man
dealing
only
with
the
natural
finites
the
old
infinitesimals
and
great
numbers
of
different
orders
including
the
normal
numbers
but
starting
from
a
real
common
and
next
to
it
very
small
number
which
is
a
common
base
for
as
well
as
truths
this
new
philosophic
mathematics
would
eliminate
the
concept
of
infinitesimals
as
such
which
is
an
concept
and
is
not
as
a
an
element
of
nature
the
are
nature
s
real
natural
in
mathematics
the
infinitesimals
were
an
because
of
our
starting
point
i
repeat
once
again
that
this
transposition
of
our
starting
point
would
not
affect
the
normal
mathematics
for
normal
purposes
it
would
build
rather
a
new
philosophic
mathematics
rigorously
correct
where
analytical
facts
would
be
also
psychological
facts
this
new
mathematics
would
not
only
give
correct
results
but
also
results
keeping
in
mind
conceptions
of
time
the
scientific
time
and
the
psychological
time
we
may
see
that
the
human
capacity
of
is
a
very
practical
one
and
that
this
faculty
is
a
name
and
definition
for
what
we
broadly
mean
by
human
intelligence
which
makes
it
obvious
that
time
in
any
understanding
of
the
term
is
somehow
very
closely
related
to
mental
and
spiritual
activities
of
man
we
know
about
time
will
explain
to
us
a
great
deal
about
man
and
all
we
know
about
man
will
explain
to
us
a
great
deal
about
if
we
consider
alone
the
ghosts
in
the
background
will
rapidly
vanish
and
become
intelligible
facts
for
philosophic
mathematics
the
most
vital
importance
nevertheless
is
that
taking
zero
as
the
limit
and
the
next
to
it
very
small
magnitude
for
the
real
starting
point
it
will
give
us
a
mathematical
science
from
a
natural
base
where
formulas
will
be
also
true
formulas
and
will
correspond
to
psychological
truths
we
have
found
that
man
is
an
exponential
function
where
time
enters
as
an
exponent
if
we
compare
the
formula
for
organic
growth
with
the
formula
we
see
that
they
are
of
the
same
type
and
the
of
organic
applies
to
the
human
we
see
too
that
the
energy
is
also
and
multiplying
in
larger
and
larger
families
the
formula
for
the
decomposing
of
radium
is
the
the
exponent
is
negative
instead
of
positive
this
fact
is
indeed
very
curious
and
suggestive
procreation
the
organic
growth
is
also
some
function
of
time
i
call
for
the
sake
of
difference
whether
the
energy
of
procreation
or
that
of
can
be
accounted
for
in
units
of
chemical
energy
taken
up
in
food
i
do
not
know
not
so
with
the
higher
exponential
energy
able
to
direct
basic
if
we
analyse
this
energy
free
from
any
speculation
we
will
find
that
this
higher
energy
which
is
somehow
directly
connected
with
time
matter
what
time
able
to
by
transformation
or
by
drawing
on
other
sources
of
energy
new
energies
unknown
to
nature
thus
the
solar
energy
transformed
into
coal
is
for
instance
transformed
into
the
energy
of
the
drive
of
a
piston
or
the
rotary
energy
in
a
steam
engine
and
so
on
it
is
obvious
that
no
amount
of
energy
in
food
can
account
for
such
an
energy
as
the
energy
there
is
only
one
supposition
left
namely
that
the
apparatus
has
a
source
for
its
tremendous
energy
in
the
of
organic
is
very
results
are
energies
this
supposition
is
almost
a
certainty
because
it
seems
to
be
the
only
possible
supposition
to
account
for
that
energy
this
supposition
which
seems
to
be
the
only
supposition
would
bring
us
to
face
striking
facts
namely
the
transformation
of
organic
atoms
which
means
a
direct
drawing
upon
the
cosmic
energy
and
this
cosmic
intelligence
are
somehow
not
indeed
equivalent
happily
these
things
can
be
verified
in
scientific
laboratories
radium
was
discovered
only
a
few
years
ago
and
is
still
very
scarce
but
the
results
for
science
and
life
are
already
tremendous
because
scientific
methods
were
applied
in
the
understanding
and
use
of
it
we
did
not
use
any
zoological
or
theological
methods
but
just
direct
correct
and
scientific
methods
there
is
no
scarcity
in
human
radium
but
to
my
knowledge
physicists
have
never
attempted
to
study
this
energy
from
that
point
of
view
i
am
confident
that
if
once
they
start
there
will
be
results
in
which
all
the
supernatural
spiritual
psychic
phenomena
such
as
are
not
fakes
will
become
scientifically
understood
and
will
be
consciously
utilized
now
they
are
mostly
wasted
or
only
played
with
it
may
happen
that
the
science
of
the
science
of
disclose
to
us
the
inner
and
final
final
nature
valid
in
infinity
it
is
very
difficult
to
give
in
such
a
book
as
this
an
adequate
list
of
the
literature
which
may
help
to
orient
the
reader
in
a
general
way
in
the
great
advance
science
has
made
in
the
last
few
years
this
book
is
a
pioneer
book
in
its
own
way
and
so
there
are
no
books
dealing
directly
with
its
subject
there
are
two
branches
of
science
and
one
art
which
are
fundamental
for
the
further
development
of
the
subject
these
two
sciences
are
mathematical
philosophy
and
scientific
biology
the
art
is
the
art
of
creative
engineering
in
mathematical
philosophy
there
are
to
my
knowledge
only
four
great
mathematical
writers
who
treat
the
subject
as
a
distinct
science
they
are
two
english
scientists
bertrand
russell
and
whitehead
one
frenchman
henri
poincaré
deceased
and
one
american
professor
keyser
russell
and
whitehead
approach
the
problems
from
a
purely
logical
point
of
view
and
therein
lies
the
peculiar
value
of
their
work
henri
poincaré
was
a
physicist
as
well
as
a
mathematician
and
therefore
approaches
the
problems
somewhat
from
a
physicist
s
point
of
view
a
circumstance
giving
his
philosophy
its
particular
value
professor
keyser
approaches
the
problems
from
both
the
logical
and
the
warmly
human
points
of
view
in
this
is
the
great
human
and
practical
value
of
his
work
these
four
scientists
are
unique
in
their
respective
elaborations
and
elucidations
of
mathematical
philosophy
it
is
not
for
me
to
advise
the
reader
what
selections
to
make
for
if
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
subject
is
desired
the
reader
should
read
all
these
books
but
not
all
readers
are
willing
to
make
that
effort
toward
clear
thinking
which
in
the
meantime
will
remain
of
the
importance
in
science
some
readers
will
wish
to
select
for
themselves
and
to
facilitate
their
selection
i
will
lay
out
a
menu
of
this
intellectual
feast
by
giving
in
some
cases
the
chapter
heads
for
many
temporary
reasons
i
was
not
able
before
going
into
print
to
give
a
fuller
list
of
the
writings
of
those
four
unique
men
but
there
is
no
stroke
of
their
pen
but
which
should
be
read
with

there
is

and
the
life
of
one
man
is
short
and
to
very
few
is
it
given
to
achieve
much
in
their
lifetime
extensive
achievements
are
made
almost
entirely
by
many
men
taking
up
the
work
done
by
a
discoverer
in
such
a
case
we
arrive
at
a
truth
not
by
the
production
of
one
man
but
by
a
chain
of
men
but
the
initial
discovery
not
only
has
to
be
produced
but
correctly
defined
before
it
can
be
used
and
that
is
the
important
point
to
be
made
what
we
do
not
realize
is
the
tremendous
amount
of
mental
work
that
is
lost
by
an
incorrect
use
of
words
human
unique
subtle
and
yet
most
energetic
phenomenon
of
in
the
main
wantonly
wasted
because
we
do
not
use
or
take
pains
to
use
suitable
language
at
the
same
time
false
definitions
lead
to
consequences
not
merely
wasteful
but
positively
harmful
when
ideas
and
facts
are
falsely
defined
they
tend
to
bring
us
to
false
conclusions
and
false
conclusions
lead
us
in
wrong
directions
and
life
and
knowledge
greatly
suffer
in
consequence
our
progress
is
not
a
well
ordered
pursuit
after
truth
as
pure
chance
plays
too
large
a
part
in
it
until
lately
logic
was
supposed
to
be
the
science
of
correct
thinking
but
modern
thought
has
progressed
so
far
that
the
old
logic
is
not
able
to
handle
the
great
accumulated
great
complicated
mass
of
existing
ideas
and
so
we
are
forced
to
look
for
another
instrument
much
more
expedient
and
powerful
there
is
no
need
to
establish
a
new
science
to
replace
logic
we
simply
have
to
look
closer
into
the
sciences
at
hand
and
realize
the
fact
which
was
with
us
all
the
time
namely
that
mathematics
and
mathematical
reasoning
is
nothing
else
than
the
true
logic
of
s
universal
one
means
of
expression
that
is
the
same
for
all
peoples
this
is
not
a
play
on
words
it
is
a
fact
which
after
investigation
everybody
must
admit
everybody
who
wants
to
think
logically
must
think
mathematically
or
give
up
any
pretense
of
correct
is
no
escape
and
all
who
refuse
to
investigate
the
justice
of
this
statement
put
themselves
outside
the
pale
of
logically
thinking
people
the
application
of
rigorous
thinking
to
life
will
even
revolutionize
scientific
methods
by
the
introduction
of
right
definitions
correct
classifications
just
language
and
so
will
lead
to
trustworthy
results
very
probably
all
our
doctrines
and
creeds
will
have
to
be
revised
some
rejected
some
rectified
some
broadened
bringing
about
unanimity
of
all
sciences
and
thus
greatly
increasing
their
effectiveness
in
the
pursuit
of
truth
this
application
of
mathematics
to
life
will
even
revolutionize
mathematics
itself
in
app
i
it
is
suggested
tentatively
how
this
may
be
accomplished
as
the
seemingly
ultimate
and
highest
experimentally
known
energy
is
the
human
energy
this
new
concept
may
lead
to
a
change
in
our
present
concepts
of
matter
space
and
time
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
discovery
of
radium
has
affected
them
this
problem
can
be
solved
only
by
experiments
with
the
energy
in
many
even
in
most
of
the
cases
the
analysis
of
these
phenomena
presents
great
technical
difficulty
but
why
confuse
our
minds
by
being
afraid
of
or
being
a
slave
of
words
if
instead
of
calling
wine
we
called
it
by
its
chemical
formula
would
this
in
any
way
change
the
quality
of
wine
of
course
not
all
the
qualities
will
remain
because
they
are
facts
and
can
not
be
altered
by
words
a
most
pathetic
picture
of
the
havoc
and
chaos
which
wrong
use
of
words
brings
into
life
and
science
is
exhibited
in
all
fields
of
thought
by
the
endless
and
bitter
fighting
over
words
not
well
defined
mathematics
has
been
able
to
make
its
most
stupendous
achievements
because
of
its
method
of
exact
analysis
of
the
continuum
dimensions
classes
relations
functions
transfinite
numbers
and
also
of
space
and
time
hitherto
not
all
of
these
conceptions
in
their
sharply
defined
form
have
had
direct
application
to
our
daily
life
or
to
our
world
conception
the
thoughts
expressed
in
app
i
may
suggest
this
missing
link
mathematics
more
intimately
with
life
modern
science
knows
that
all
energies
can
be
somehow
transformed
from
one
kind
to
another
and
that
all
of
them
represent
one
type
of
energetic
phenomena
no
matter
what
is
the
origin
of
each
for
example
a
galvanic
or
chemical
battery
produces
the
same
kind
of
electricity
as
the
mechanical
process
of
friction
or
the
interaction
of
cosmic
laws
as
in
the
dynamo
in
some
instances
when
our
systems
are
suitably
adjusted
the
transformations
are
reversible
that
is
the
energy
results
in
a
chemical
accumulator
the
chemical
process
results
in
galvanic
battery
motion
results
in
dynamo
electricity
results
in
electric
motor
etc
we
know
all
energies
are
somehow
related
to
each
other
in
that
their
transformation
is
possible
the
effects
produced
by
the
same
type
of
energy
are
absolutely
the
matter
what
its
origin
the
marvel
of
an
electric
lamp
is
the
same
marvel
whether
the
origin
of
the
electricity
be
chemical
mechanical
or
cosmic
as
in
the
dynamo
the
experiments
in
scientific
biology
have
proved
this
to
be
true
in
living
organisms
and
just
this
is
the
tremendous
importance
of
the
discoveries
in
scientific
biology
light
and
other
energies
react
on
organisms
in
the
same
way
as
the
chemical
reactions
and
these
phenomena
are
reversible
more
than
that
living
complex
organisms
have
been
produced
which
grew
to
maturity
through
a
chemical
or
mechanical
treatment
of
the
egg
and
this
has
been
accomplished
in
the
infancy
of
scientific
biology
see

a
by
jacques
loeb
all
phenomena
are
and
should
be
approached
as
the
human
mind
is
at
least
an
energy
which
can
direct
other
energies
it
is
incorrect
and
misleading
to
call
it
it
is
of
course
true
that
we
do
not
fully
understand
the
nature
of
the
human
mind
and
we
shall
learn
to
understand
it
when
and
only
when
we
acquire
sense
enough
to
recognize
it
as
if
we
persist
in
saying
and
believing
that
the
spiritual
evidences
can
not
be
explained
on
a
material
base
this
statement
should
be
equally
applicable
to
electricity
or
radium
if
this
statement
is
false
for
these
phenomena
it
is
equally
false
for
the
mind
or
the
spiritual
and
will
powers
the
scientific
understanding
of
these
phenomena
will
not
degrade
these
phenomena
that
can
not
be
done
facts
remain
facts
and
no
scientific
explanation
of
a
phenomenon
can
lower
or
degrade

electricity
and
nothing
else
no

embracing
all
faculties
are
the
highest
of
the
known
magnificent
and
matter
what
the
base
and
the
scientific
understanding
of
them
will

our
respect
for
them
and
for
ourselves

us

a

higher
and
more
embracing

than
society
has
ever
had
by
this
analysis
i
prove
that
the
understanding
of
this
most
stupendous
but
natural
phenomenon
of
human
life
brings
us
to
the
scientifical

of
ethics

i
prove
that

ideals
of
humanity
have
nothing
of
sentimentalism
or
of
the
in
them

are
exclusively
the
of
the
for
the
class
of
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
phenomena
of
the
human
mind
are
natural
and
as
such
conform
to
natural
law
has
the
further
advantage
over
the
supernatural
attitude
in
that
we
can
no
more
evade
a
law
of
human
nature
than
the
law
of
gravity
in
other
words
human
ethics
will
have
the
validity
of
natural
law
with
the
supernatural
attitude
it
was
simple
enough
to
avoid
the
issues
of
life
by
a
simple
i
do
not
believe
that
was
enough
to
break
all
bonds
and
be
free
from
the
supernatural
morale
to
get
away
from
the
natural
morale
and
human
is
impossible
whereas
with
an
artificially
formulated
morale
it
was
easy
enough
to
break
away
by
a
simple
mental
speculation
and
feel
perfectly
satisfied
as
long
as
one
escaped
the
jail
with
a
morale
made
clear
that
it
is

natural
law
for
the
human

the

of
sophistry
and
speculation
is
removed
and
everyone
who
breaks
away
from
the
natural
laws

humans
will
know
by
himself
that
he
is
outside
the
humans
engineers
are
not
metaphysicians
their
field
is
not
one
of
clever
argument
but
one
of
proved
facts
their
work
is
not
to
befog
the
air
with
cloudy
expressions
or
sophistry
but
to
create
their
method
is
scientific
and
their
tool
is
mathematics
it
is
known
that
in
remote
antiquity
in
some
temples
electrical
phenomena
were
known
and
were
used
to
keep
the
ignorant
masses
in
awe
and
obedience
shall
we
follow
the
methods
used
by
those
magicians
or
shall
we
squarely
face
facts
shall
we
look
upon
life
and
the
usually
mental
spiritual
phenomena
as
simply
because
we
do
not
understand
them
it
seems
evident
that
everything
which
in
nature
is
no
matter
how
simple
or
complicated
a
phenomenon
it
is
and
on
no
occasion
can
the
be
anything
else
than
a
completely
natural
law
though
it
may
at
the
moment
be
above
or
beyond
our
present
understanding
the
attitude
of
mind
which
admits
the
blinds
and
frustrates
any
analysis
or
any
attempt
at
analysis
the
unprejudiced
analysis
of
the
supernatural
does
not
any
part
of
the
strange
and
high
functions
of
it
the
phenomena
of
the
human
energy
are
and
will
remain
the
most
precious
subtle
and
highest
of
known
functions
no
matter
what
the
origin
may
not
be
or
if
analysis
is
to
arrive
at
correct
conclusions
the
high
dimensionality
of
the
human
mind
the
spiritual
and
will
powers
and
must
be
as
such
it
is
about
time
to
establish
an
exact
science
to
deal
with
them
the
problems
of
animal
life
were
approached
without
prejudice
no
supernatural
spark
was
bothering
us
in
our
animal
was
an
animal
and
nothing
did
not
intermix
dimensions
therefore
we
see
that
the
social
structure
of
the
animals
on
a
farm
never
breaks
down
as
they
are
managed
on
a
scientific
base
with
an
understanding
of
proper
standards
animals
live
more
happily
than
man
we
don
t
allow
animals
to
practice
the
survival
of
the
fittest
or
competition
which
is
far
too
destructive
our
present
social
system
imposes
these
disastrous
methods
upon
man
alone
and
the
result
is
that
the
hideous
proverb
homo
homini
lupus
has
become
true
in
modern
science
facts
are
not
wanting
we
have
first
but
to
know
them
if
we
take
for
example
sulphuric
acid
and
zinc
and
make
what
we
call
a
galvanic
battery
we
see
that
from
two
chemical
substances
a
made
in
addition
to
which
we
have
a
peculiar
energy
produced
called
electricity
who
does
not
know
the
marvelous
properties
of
this
phenomenon
scientific
biology
has
made
tremendous
progress
lately
engineers
can
not
afford
to
ignore
the
facts
established
in
laboratory
researches
the
problem
of
life
and
of
other
energies
hitherto
considered
is
well
in
hand
and
proves
to
be
none
the
less
astonishing
though
entirely
natural
a
number
of
scientists
all
over
the
world
are
working
at
this
problem
and
the
scientific
facts
which
they
have
established
and
which
can
not
now
be
denied
belong
to
the
realm
of
practical
life
engineers
of
course
have
to
know
these
facts
mathematicians
have
to
establish
correct
dimensions
in
the
study
of
all
the
sciences
and
people
will
have
to
study
mathematical
philosophy
only
then
can
the
process
of
integration
in
any
phase
of
thought
be
made
without
mistakes
there
is
no
escape
from
that
if
is
what
we
really
want
but
here
one
objection
may
be
raised
an
objection
which
for
some
is
a
serious
one
indeed
namely
what
will
take
the
place
of
the
old
philosophy
law
and
ethics
if
human
life
is
nothing
else
than
a
process
to
quote
doctor
jacques
loeb
from
his
conception
of
if
on
the
basis
of
a
serious
survey
this
question
all
life
phenomena
can
be
unequivocally
explained
in
can
be
answered
in
the
affirmative
our
social
and
ethical
life
will
have
to
be
put
on
a
scientific
basis
and
our
rules
of
conduct
must
be
brought
into
harmony
with
the
results
of
scientific
biology
not
only
is
the
mechanistic
conception
of
life
compatible
with
ethics
it
seems
the
only
conception
of
life
which
can
lead
to
an
understanding
of
the
source
of
i
hope
to
have
proved
in
this
book
that
ethics
is
based
on
natural
laws
for
the
human
class
of
life
that
it
is
based
on
the
experimentally
proved
fact
that
man
is
a
naturally
active
as
such
in
time
and
that
this
concept
or
definition
of
man
is
rigorously
scientific
and
accounts
for
the
highest
functions
of
highest
of
the
mental
and
spiritual
the
need
of
any
hypothesis
scientific
biology
proves
the
fact
that
life
and
all
of
its
phenomena
are
the
results
of
some
special
processes
which
manifest
themselves
in
some
peculiar
energies
of
which
the
human
mind
is
the
highest
known
form
these
processes
are
known
to
be
reversible
in
that
some
of
these
peculiar
energies
cause
changes
in
their
own
base
the
process
involved
i
propose
to
call
biolysis
as
i
propose
to
call
biolyte
the
substances
produced
these
phenomena
have
a
parallel
analogy
in
inorganic
difference
being
only
in
the
scale
or
dimension
when
an
electric
current
is
passed
through
a
special
battery
called
an
accumulator
or
reversible
battery
chemical
changes
occur
in
that
new
compounds
are
formed
which
possess
a
reversible
capacity
namely
in
reproducing
the
former
is
electricity
is
generated
this
process
of
forming
chemical
substances
by
the
passing
of
an
electrical
current
is
called
electrolysis
and
the
product
so
produced
is
called
electrolyte
at
the
same
time
it
is
a
known
fact
that
organic
chemistry
is
infinitely
more
complicated
and
variable
than
inorganic
chemistry
the
energy
produced
by
the
reactions
of
some
organic
chemical
groups
are
therefore
of
a
more
complicated
character
and
of
another
dimension
one
of
these
energies
of
organic
chemistry
which
lately
has
come
into
the
scope
of
scientific
analysis
is
called
base
is
the
protoplasm
which
i
call
the
capacity
or
energy
this
name
is
important
for
the
consequences
it
will
bring
about
later
on
the
capacity
or
energy
of
man
no
matter
what
time
it
is
which
is
unique
to
man
is
a
most
subtle
complex
it
is
the
highest
known
energy
and
probably
has
many
subdivisions
ears
are
sensitive
to
the
vibration
of
the
air
eyes
are
sensitive
to
the
more
subtle
vibrations
of
light
in
a
similar
way
the
apparatus
is
sensitive
to
the
most
subtle
energies
besides
which
it
has
the
capacity
to
register
not
only
all
of
our
sensations
but
also
the
energies
of
other
people
and
it
apparently
has
the
capacity
to
register
the
energies
of
the
universe
here
again
we
see
the
same
continuity
of
phenomena
the
protoplasm
as
a

biology
and
is
the

for
simplicity
i
represent
the
whole

as
one
base
of
the
human
energy
is
the
thought
produced
by
a
process
corresponding
for
illustration
s
sake
only
to
electricity
produced
by
a
galvanic
battery
the
thought
in
turn
produces
a
effect
on
the
base
corresponding
for
the
same
reason
to
electrolysis
and
electrolyte
in

and
combined
or
produces
which
again
in
turn
affects
the
base
and
produces
a
effect
this
new
combination
produces
the
energy
and
so
on
theoretically
without
limits
as
long
as
there
is
of
energy
upon
which
this
special
energy
can
draw
this
theory
which
i
call
the
spiral
theory
represents
a
suggestive
working
mechanism
of
the
energy
and
is
in
accord
with
the
latest
scientific
discoveries
it
explains
the
processes
of
all
the
mental
and
spiritual
energies
which
have
been
such
a
puzzle
to
humanity
and
it
also
explains
other
phenomena
which
until
now
have
had
no
scientific
explanation
whatever
the
animals
are
they
have
the
capacity
of
the
spiral
therefore
they
have
not
autonomous
progress
at
the
same
time
it
will
be
obvious
that
if
we
teach
humans
false
ideas
we
affect
their
capacities
and
energies
very
seriously
by
affecting
in
a
wrong
way
the
base
this
energy
is
so
peculiar
that
it
embraces
if
i
may
use
the
old
expression
the
highest
ideals
when
the
energy
is
unobstructed
and
is
allowed
to
work
normally
and
also
the
most
criminal
ideas
when
the
energy
is
obstructed
by
false
teachings
and
in
consequence
works
abnormally
we
can
not
make
animals
moral
or
immoral
because
they
have
not
this
capacity
whereas
human
progress
can
be
very
seriously
affected
by
false
ideas
in
other
words
the
biolyte
of
false
teachings
in
the
animal
dimension
must
be
very
different
from
the
biolyte
of
true
ideas
in
the
human
dimension
nature
or
nature
s
laws
happily
can
not
be
completely
deviated
from
or
energy
can
not
be
completely
suppressed
in
the
class
of
life
the
false
teachings
that
we
are
animals
and
essentially
brutal
and
selfish
can
of
course
degrade
human
nature
not
only
down
to
the
animal
level
but
lower
still
happily
now
science
can
explain
and
prove
how
fundamentally
fiendish
in
effect
are
these
teachings
in
the
life
and
progress
of
human
beings
it
will
be
a
shock
to
those
who
teach
preach
and
practice
animal
standards
and
in
the
same
breath
contradict
themselves
in
any
talking
about
immortality
and
salvation
a
little
thought
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
animal
standards
and
salvation
or
immortality
simply
exclude
each
other
with
the
natural
law
of
realized
the
way
is
open
to
entering
scientifically
upon
the
problem
of
immortality
the
energies
as
well
as
life
follow
the
same
type
of
exponential
function
the
constant
synthesis
then
of
specific
material
from
simple
compounds
of
a
character
is
the
chief
feature
by
which
living
matter
differs
from
matter
this
problem
of
synthesis
leads
to
the
assumption
of
immortality
of
the
living
cell
since
there
is
no
reason
why
this
synthesis
should
ever
come
to
a
standstill
of
its
own
accord
as
long
as
enough
food
is
available
and
the
proper
outside
physical
conditions
are
guaranteed
the
idea
that
the
body
cells
are
naturally
immortal
and
die
only
if
exposed
to
extreme
injuries
such
as
prolonged
lack
of
oxygen
or
too
high
a
temperature
helps
to
make
one
problem
more
intelligible
the
medical
student
who
for
the
first
time
realizes
that
life
depends
upon
that
one
organ
the
heart
doing
its
duty
incessantly
for
the
seventy
years
or
so
allotted
to
man
is
amazed
at
the
precariousness
of
our
existence
it
seems
indeed
uncanny
that
so
delicate
a
mechanism
should
function
so
regularly
for
so
many
years
the
mysticism
connected
with
this
and
other
phenomena
of
adaptation
would
disappear
if
we
would
be
certain
that
all
cells
are
really
immortal
and
that
the
fact
which
demands
an
explanation
is
not
the
continued
activity
but
the
cessation
of
activity
in
death
thus
we
see
that
the
idea
of
the
immortality
of
the
body
cell
if
it
can
be
generalized
may
be
destined
to
become
one
of
the
main
supports
for
a
complete
analysis
of
life
phenomena
since
it
makes
the
durability
of
organisms
intelligible
organism
as
a
by
jacques
loeb
the
outlook
for
those
who
live
and
profess
selfish
greedy
animal
standards
is
not
very
promising
as
disclosed
by
the
spiral
but
unhappily
we
can
not
help
them
only
fulfilling
the
natural
laws
for
give
them
the
full
benefit
of
their
natural
capacities
by
which
they
will
be
able
to
raise
themselves
above
animals
and
their
fate
the
results
obtained
in
scientific
biological
researches
are
growing
very
rapidly
and
every
advance
in
their
knowledge
proves
this
theory
to
be
true
if
they
differ
in
a
few
instances
it
is
not
because
the
principles
of
this
theory
are
wrong
but
because
they
intermix
dimensions
and
use
words
not
sufficiently
defined
which
always
results
in
confusion
and
the
checking
of
the
progress
of
science
most
of
the
problems
touched
upon
in
this
appendix
from
a
mathematical
point
of
view
are
based
upon
laboratory
facts
we
have
only
to
collect
them
and
there
is
little
need
of
imagination
to
see
their
general
bearing
since
we
have
discovered
the
fact
that
man
is
a
no
matter
what
time
is
and
have
introduced
the
sense
of
dimensionality
into
the
study
of
life
phenomena
in
general
a
great
many
facts
which
were
not
clear
before
become
very
clear
now
i
wrote
this
book
on
a
farm
without
any
books
at
hand
and
i
had
been
out
of
touch
with
the
progress
of
science
for
the
five
years
spent
in
the
war
service
and
war
duties
my
friend
formerly
at
berkeley
university
drew
my
attention
particularly
to
the
books
of
jacques
loeb
i
found
there
a
treasury
of
laboratory
facts
which
illustrate
as
nothing
better
could
the
correctness
of
my
theory
i
found
with
deep
satisfaction
that
the
new
scientific
biology
is
scientific
because
it
has
used
mathematical
methods
with
notable
regard
to
do
not
milk
an
for
the
mathematician
and
the
engineer
the
tropism
theory
of
animal
conduct
founded
by
loeb
is
of
the
greatest
interest
because
this
is
a
theory
which
analyses
the
functions
and
reactions
of
an
organism
a
and
therefore
there
is
no
chance
for
confusion
of
ideas
or
the
intermixing
of
dimensions
physiologists
have
long
been
in
the
habit
of
studying
not
the
reactions
of
the
whole
organism
but
the
reactions
of
isolated
segments
the
reflexes
while
it
may
seem
justifiable
to
construct
the
reactions
of
the
organism
as
a
whole
from
the
individual
reflexes
such
an
attempt
is
in
reality
doomed
to
failure
since
the
reactions
produced
in
an
isolated
element
can
not
be
counted
upon
to
occur
when
the
same
element
is
part
of
the
whole
on
account
of
the
mutual
inhibitions
which
the
different
parts
of
the
organism
produce
upon
each
other
when
in
organic
connection
and
it
is
therefore
impossible
to
express
the
conduct
of
a
whole
animal
as
the
algebraic
sum
of
the
reflexes
of
its
isolated
segments
it
would
therefore
be
a
misconception
to
speak
of
tropism
as
of
reflexes
since
tropisms
are
reactions
of
the
organism
as
a
whole
while
reflexes
are
reactions
of
isolated
segments
reflexes
and
tropisms
agree
however
in
one
respect
inasmuch
as
both
are
obviously
of
a
purely
and
animal
by
jacques
loeb
i
will
quote
here
only
a
very
few
passages
but
these
books
are
of
such
importance
that
every
mathematician
and
engineer
should
read
them
they
are
if
i
may
say
so
a
mathematical
biology
survey
of
a
life
long
study
of
tropisms
which
is
the
name
given
to
express
forced
movements
in
organisms
they
give
the
quintessence
of
laboratory
experiments
as
to
what
are
the
effects
of
different
energies
such
as
light
heliotropism
electricity
galvanotropism
gravity
geotropism
in
their
reaction
and
influence
upon
the
movements
and
actions
of
living
organisms
these
experiments
are
conclusive
and
the
conclusions
arrived
at
can
not
be
overlooked
or
evaded
the
tremendous
practical
results
of
such
scientific
methods
are
based
upon
two
principles
namely
that
the
scientists
must
think
mathematically
their
studies
of
the
phenomena
must
be
in
systems
as
a
complex
whole
and
they
must
not
intermix
dimensions
they
must
see
the
danger
and
not
be
afraid
of
old
words
with
wrong
meanings
but
must
use
clear
and
rigorous
thinking
to
eliminate
the
prejudices
in
poison
of
metaphysical
speculating
with
words
or
verbalism
these
books
give
ample
proofs
of
how
misleading
and
obscuring
are
the
words
used
and
how
basically
wrong
are
the
conclusions
arrived
at
by
such
scientists
as
still
persist
in
using
the
anthropomorphic
or
teleological
methods
of
analysis
if
a
sceptical
or
doubtful
reader
is
interested
to
see
an
ample
proof
of
how
deadly
is
the
effect
which
an
incorrect
or
unmathematical
manner
of
thinking
brings
into
science
and
also
may
be
referred
to
these
books
the
following
quotations
prove
biologically
that
man
is
of
a
totally
different
totally
different
being
than
an
animal
from
conklin
i
quote
only
from
his
and
and
to
save
a
repetition
of
the
title
of
the
book
i
will
indicate
the
quotations
by
using
only
his
name
all
italics
are
indicated
by
it
would
be
of
the
greatest
importance
to
show
directly
that
the
proteins
of
different
species
are
has
been
for
hemoglobins
of
the
blood
by
reichert
and
brown
who
have
shown
by
crystallographic
measurements
that
the
hemoglobins
of
any
species
are
definite
substances
for
that
species
the
following
sentences
by
reichert
and
brown
seem
to
indicate
that
this
may
be
true
for
the
crystals
of
hemoglobin
hemoglobins
of
any
species
are
different
substances
for
that
but
upon
comparing
the
corresponding
substances
hemoglobins
in
different
species
of
a
genus
it
is
generally
found
that
they
differ
the
one
from
the
other
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
the
differences
being
such
that
when
complete
crystallographic
data
are
available
the
different
can
be
by
these
in
their
the
facts
thus
far
reported
imply
the
suggestion
that
heredity
of
the
genus
is
determined
by
the
proteins
of
a
definite
constitution
differing
from
the
proteins
of
other
genera
this
constitution
of
the
proteins
would
therefore
be
responsible
for
the
genus
heredity
the
different
species
of
a
genus
have
all
the
same
genus
proteins
but
the
proteins
of
each
species
of
the
same
genus
are
apparently
different
again
in
chemical
constitution
and
hence
they
may
give
rise
to
the
specific
biological
or
immunity
organism
as
a
by
jacques
loeb
peculiarities
which
are
characteristic
of
a
race

genus
order
class
and
phylum
are
of
course
otherwise
there
would
be
no
constant
characteristics
of
these
groups
and
no
possibility
of
classifying
organisms
the
chief
characters
of
every
living
thing
are
unalterably
fixed
by
heredity
men
do
not
gather
grapes
of

nor

of
the

known
species
of

of
inherited
peculiarities
they
have
come
from
different
kinds
of
germ
conklin
the
entire
organism
consisting
of
structures
and
functions
body
and
mind
develops
out
of
the
germ
and
the
organization
of
the
germ
determines
all
the
possibilities
of
development
of
the
mind
no
less
than
of
the
body
though
the
actual
realization
of
any
possibility
is
dependent
also
upon
environmental
conklin
the
development
of
the
mind
that
of
the
whatever
the
ultimate
relation
of
the
mind
and
body
may
be
there
can
be
reasonable
that
the
two
develop
together
from
the
germ
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
many
people
who
are
seriously
disturbed
by
scientific
teaching
as
to
the
evolution
or
gradual
development
of
the
human
race
accept
with
equanimity
the
universal
observation
as
to
the
development
of
the
human
individual
as
well
as
body
the
animal
ancestry
of
the
race
is
surely
no
more
disturbing
to
philosophical
or
religious
beliefs
than
the
germinal
origin
of
the
individual
and
yet
the
latter
is
a
fact
of
universal
observation
which
can
not
be
relegated
to
the
domain
of
hypothesis
or
theory
and
which
can
not
be
successfully
denied
now
we
know
that
the
child
comes
from
the
germ
cells
which
are
not
made
by
the
bodies
of
the
parents
but
have
arisen
by
the
division
of
the
antecedent
germ
cell
cell
comes
from
a
by
a
process
of
division
and
germ
cell
comes
from
a
germ
consequently
it
is
not
possible
to
hold
that
the
body
generates
germ
cells
nor
that
the
soul
generates
souls
the
only
possible
scientific
position
is
that
the
or
soul
as
well
as
the
body
develops
from
the
no
fact
in
human
experience
is
more
certain
than
that
the
mind
develops
by
gradual
and
natural
processes
from
a
simple
condition
which
can
scarcely
be
called
mind
at
all
no
fact
in
human
experience
is
fraught
with
greater
practical
and
philosophical
significance
than
this
and
yet
no
fact
is
more
generally
conklin
doubtless
the
elements
of
which
develops
are
in
the
germ
in
the
same
sense
that
the
elements
of
the
other
psychic
processes
or
of
the
organs
of
the
body
are
there
present
not
as
a
miniature
of
the
adult
condition
but
rather
in
the
form
of
elements
or
factors
which
by
long
series
of
combinations
and
transformations
due
to
interactions
with
one
another
and
with
the
environment
give
rise
to
the
fully
developed
condition
it
is
an
interesting
fact
that
in
man
and
in
several
other
animals
which
may
be
assumed
to
have
a
sense
of
identity

from

to

they

of

quite
impossible

more
rapidly

that

sooner
comes
to
an
end
the

any

is
bad
which
leads
to
the
formation
of
habits
of
idleness
carelessness
failure
instead
of
habits
of
industry
thoroughness
and
success
any
religious
or
social

is
bad
which
leads
to
habits
of
pious
insincerity
slavish
regard
for
authority
and
disregard
for

instead
of

of

and
independence
all
that
man
now
is
he
has
come
to
be
without
conscious
human
guidance
if
evolution
has
progressed
from
the
am
oe
ba
to
man
without
human
interference
if
the
great
progress
from
men
to
the
most
highly
civilized
races
has
taken
place
without
conscious
human
control
the
question
may
well
be
asked
is
it
possible
to
improve
on
the
natural
method
of
evolution
it
may
not
be
possible
to
improve
on
the
method
of
evolution
and
yet
by
intelligent
action
it
may
be
possible
to
facilitate
that
method
can
not
change
a
single
law
of
nature
but
he
can
put
himself
into
such
relations
to
natural
laws
that
he
can
profit
by
conklin
this
proves
the
great
importance
of
knowing
the
natural
laws
for
the
human
class
of
life
and
making
natural
impulses
conscious
for
then
only
will
the

give

logarithmical

of
the
right

otherwise
the
biolyte
will
be

in

as
well
as
in

here
it
is
immaterial
how
the

produced
the
fact
that
he
is
of
another
dimension
is
of
the
greatest
importance
from
sands
to
stars
from
the
immensity
of
the
universe
to
the
minuteness
of
the
electron
in
living
things
no
less
than
in
lifeless

science
recognizes
everywhere
the
inevitable
sequence
of
cause
and
effect
the
universality
of
natural
processes
the
reign
of
natural
law
also
is
a
part
of
nature
a
part
of
the
great
mechanism
of
universe
and
all
that
he
is
and
is
limited
and
prescribed
by
laws
of
every
human
being
comes
into
existence
by
a
process
of
development
every
step
of
which
is
determined
by
antecedent
causes
our
anatomical
physiological
psychological
possibilities
were
predetermined
in
the
from
which
we
came
conklin
this
shows
the
importance
of
keeping
the
study
of
humans
in
their
own
dimensionality
and
also
the
importance
of
finding
the
impersonal
natural
laws
for
the
human
class
of
life
now
it
can
be
realized
that
all
the
human
ideals
are
none
else
than
the
ever
growing
fulfillment
of
the
natural
laws
this
understanding
will
enable
man
to
discover
new
laws
for
their
conduct
their
business
relations
their
state
which
will
not
be
a
contradiction
of
the
real
natural
laws
but
will
be
in
accord
with
them
then
and
only
then
human
progress
will
have
a
chance
to
develop
peacefully
adult
characteristics
are
potential
and
not
actual
in
the
germ
and
their
actual
appearance
depends
upon
many
complicated
reactions
of
the
germinal
units
with
one
another
and
with
the
environment
in
short
our
actual
personalities
are
not
predetermined
in
the

cells
but
our
possible
personalities
are
the
influence
of
environment
upon
the

and

of
men
is
especially
great
to
a
large
extent
our
habits
words
thoughts
our
aspirations
ideals
satisfactions
our
responsibility
morality
religion
are
the
results
of
the
environment
and
education
of
our
early
years
owing
to
this
vastly
greater
power
of
memory
reflection
and
inhibition
man
is
much
freer
than
any
other
animal
animals
which
learn
little
from
experience
have
little
freedom
and
the
more
they
learn
the
freer
they
become
conklin
it
may
be
added
here
that
the
spiral
theory
explains
how
our
reactions
can
be
accelerated
and
elaborated
by
ourselves
and
how
truly
we
are
the
masters
of
our
destinies
because
we
can
find
no
place
in
our
philosophy
and
logic
for
self
determination
shall
we
cease
to
be
scientists
and
close
our
eyes
to
the
evidence
the
first
duty
of
science
is
to
appeal
to
fact
and
to
settle
later
with
logic
and
philosophy
conklin
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
the
settlement
of
facts
with
the
new
philosophy
of
human
the
analysis
of
instinct
from
a
purely
physiological
point
of
view
ultimately
furnishes
the
data
for
a
scientific
ethics
human
happiness
is
based
upon
the
possibility
of
a
natural
and
harmonious
satisfaction
of
the
instincts
it
is
rather
remarkable
that
we
should
still
be
under
the
influence
of
an
ethics
which
considers
the
human
instincts
in
themselves
low
and
their
gratification
vicious
that
such
an
ethics
must
have
had
a
comforting
effect
upon
the
orientals
whose
instincts
were
inhibited
or
warped
through
the
combined
effects
of
an
enervating
climate
despotism
and
miserable
economic
conditions
is
intelligible
and
it
is
perhaps
due
to
a
continuation
of
the
unsatisfactory
economic
conditions
that
this
ethics
still
prevails
to
some
extent
lawyers
criminologists
and
philosophers
frequently
imagine
that
only
want
makes
man
work
this
is
an
erroneous
view
we
are
instinctively
forced
to
be
active
in
the
same
way
as
ants
or
bees
the
instinct
of
workmanship
would
be
the
greatest
source
of
happiness
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
our
present
social
and
economic
organization
allows
only
a
few
to
satisfy
this
instinct
robert
mayer
has
pointed
out
that
any
successful
display
or
setting
free
of
energy
is
a
source
of
pleasure
to
us
this
is
the
reason
why
the
satisfaction
of
the
instinct
of
workmanship
is
of
such
importance
in
the
economy
of
life
for
the
play
and
learning
of
the
child
as
well
as
for
the
scientists
or
commercial
work
of
the
man
we
can
vary
at
will
the
instincts
of
animals
a
number
of
marine
animals
go
away
from
the
light
can
be
forced
to
go
to
light
in
two
ways
first
by
lowering
the
temperature
and
second
by
increasing
the
concentration
of
the
sea
water
whereby
the
cells
of
the
animals
lose
water
this
instinct
can
be
again
reversed
by
raising
the
temperature
or
by
lowering
the
concentration
of
the
sea
water
i
have
found
repeatedly
that
by
the
same
conditions
by
which
phenomena
of
growth
and
organization
can
be
controlled
the
instincts
are
controlled
also
this
indicates
that
there
is
a
common
basis
for
both
classes
of
life
phenomena
this
common
base
is
the
physical
and
chemical
character
of
the
mixture
of
substances
which
we
call
protoplasm
greatest
happiness
in
can
be
obtained
only
if
that
of
workmanship
included
can
be
maintained
at
a
certain
but
while
it
is
certain
that
the
individual
can
ruin
or
diminish
the
value
of
its
life
by
a
onesided
development
of
its
instincts
dissipation
it
is
at
the
same
time
true
that
the
and
social
conditions
can
ruin
or
diminish
the
value
of
life
for
a
great
number
of
it
is
no
doubt
true
that
in
our
present
social
and
economic
conditions
more
than
ninety
per
cent
of
human
beings
lead
an
existence
whose
value
is
far
below
what
it
should
be
they
are
compelled
by
want
to
sacrifice
a
number
of
instincts
especially
the
most
valuable
among
them
that
of
workmanship
in
order
to
save
the
lowest
and
most
imperative
that
of
eating
if
those
who
amass
immense
fortunes
could
possibly
intensify
their
lives
with
their
abundance
it
might
perhaps
be
rational
to
let
many
suffer
in
order
to
have
a
few
cases
of
true
happiness
but
for
an
increase
of
happiness
only
that
amount
of
money
is
of
service
which
can
be
used
for
the
harmonious
development
and
satisfaction
of
inherited
instincts
for
this
comparatively
little
is
necessary
the
rest
is
of
no
more
use
to
a
man
than
the
surplus
of
oxygen
in
the
atmosphere
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
only
true
satisfaction
a
multimillionaire
can
possibly
get
from
increasing
his
fortunes
is
the
satisfaction
of
the
instinct
of
workmanship
or
the
pleasure
that
is
connected
with
a
successful
display
of
energy
the
scientist
gets
this
satisfaction
without
diminishing
the
value
of
life
of
his
fellow
being
and
the
same
should
be
true
for
the
business
man
although
we
recognize
no
metaphysical
we
do
not
deny
personal
responsibility
we
can
fill
the
memory
of
the
young
generation
with
such
associations
as
will
prevent
wrong
doing
or
dissipation
cruelty
in
the
penal
code
and
the
tendency
to
exaggerate
punishment
are
sure
signs
of
a
low
civilization
and
of
an
imperfect
educational
system
it
seems
to
me
that
we
can
no
more
expect
to
unravel
the
mechanism
of
associative
memory
by
histological
or
morphological
methods
than
we
can
expect
to
unravel
the
dynamics
of
electrical
phenomena
by
microscopic
study
of
through
a
telegraph
wire
or
by
counting
and
locating
the
telephone
connections
in
a
big
city
if
we
are
anxious
to
develop
a
dynamic
of
the
various
we
must
remember
that
the
colloidal
substances
are
the
machines
which
produce
the
life
phenomena
but
the
physics
of
these
substances
is
still
a
science
of
the
future
physiology
gives
us
no
answer
to
the
latter
question
the
idea
of
specific
energy
has
always
been
regarded
as
the
terminus
for
the
investigation
of
the
sense
organs
mach
expressed
the
opinion
that
chemical
conditions
lie
at
the
foundation
of

in
general
physiology
of
the
by
jacques
loeb
here
it
may
be
added
that
the
instinct
of
workmanship
in
the
animal
class
becomes
in
the
class
of
life
the
instinct
of
and
is
nothing
else
than
the
expression
of
the
natural
impulse
of
the
energy
in
the
present
social
and
economic
system
very
few
have
a
possibility
to
satisfy
this
instinct
scientific
management
is
or
may
be
satisfying
the
animal
instinct
of
workmanship
but
it
is
not
satisfactory
to
the
instinct
of
creation
in
its
last
analysis
is
creation
and
only
such
a
social
and
economic
system
as
will
satisfy
this
natural
satisfy
will
bring
about
their
fullest
growth
in
work
and
happiness
laws
of
growth
from
by
louis
karpinski
interest
function
is
of
fundamental
importance
in
other
fields
than
in
finance
thus
the
growth
of
timber
of
a
large
forest
tract
may
be
expressed
as
a
function
of
this
kind
the
assumption
being
that
in
a
large
tract
the
rate
of
growth
may
be
taken
as
uniform
from
year
to
year
in
the
case
of
bacteria
growing
under
ideal
conditions
in
a
culture
with
unlimited
food
supplied
the
increase
in
the
number
of
bacteria
per
second
is
proportional
to
the
number
of
bacteria
present
at
the
beginning
of
that
second
any
function
in
which
the
rate
of

or
rate
of

at
any
instant
is
directly
proportional
to
the
value
of
the
function
at
the
instant
obeys
what
has
been
termed
the
law
of
organic
growth
and
may
be
expressed
by
the
equation
wherein
and
are
constants
determined
by
the
physical
facts
involved
and
is
a
constant
of
nature
analogous
to
π
the
constant
is
the
proportionality
constant
and
is
negative
when
the
quantity
in
question
decreases
is
commonly
positive
the
values
of
the
function
of
increase
according
to
the
terms
of
a
geometrical
progression
as
the
variable
x
increases
in
arithmetical
the
most
immediate
application
of
a
function
in
which
the
growth
is
proportional
to
the
function
itself
is
to
the
air
the
decrease
in
the
pressure
of
the
air
at
the
distance
above
the
earth
s
surface
is
proportional
to
the
expression
gives
the
numerical
value
of
the
pressure
in
millimeters
of
mercury
for
measured
in
meters
the
negative
exponent
indicates
that
the
pressure
decreases
as
increases
in
inches
as
units
of
length
of
the
mercury
column
in
feet
this
is
known
as
halley
s
law
the
growth
of
bean
plants
within
limited
intervals
and
the
growth
of
children
again
between
quite
restricted
limits
follow
approximately
the
law
of
organic
growth
radium
in
decomposing
follows
the
same
law
the
rate
of
decrease
at
any
instant
being
proportional
to
the
quantity
in
the
case
of
vibrating
bodies
like
a
pendulum
the
rate
of
decrease
of
the
amplitude
follows
this
law
similarly
in
the
case
of
a
noise
dying
down
and
in
certain
electrical
phenomena
the
rate
of
decrease
is
proportional
at
any
instant
to
the
value
of
the
function
at
the
instant
curve
of
healing
of
a
allied
to
the
formulas
expressing
the
law
of
organic
growth
and
the
law
of
organic
decay
is
a
recently
discovered
law
which
connects
algebraically
by
an
equation
and
graphically
by
a
curve
the
of
a
wound
with
time
expressed
in
days
measured
from
the
time
when
the
wound
is
aseptic
or
sterile
when
this
aseptic
condition
is
reached
by
washing
and
flushing
continually
with
antiseptic
solutions
two
observations
at
an
interval
commonly
of
four
days
give
the
index
of
the
individual
and
this
index
and
the
two
measurements
of
area
of
the
enable
the
to
determine
the
normal
progress
of
the
the
expected
decrease
in
area
for
this
of
this
individual
the
area
of
the
wound
is
traced
carefully
on
transparent
paper
and
then
computed
by
using
a
mathematical
machine
called
a
planimeter
which
measures
areas
the
areas
of
the
wound
are
plotted
as
ordinates
with
the
respective
times
of
observation
measured
in
days
as
abscissas
after
each
observation
and
computation
of
area
the
point
so
obtained
is
plotted
to
the
same
axes
as
the
graph
which
gives
the
ideal
or
prophetic
curve
of
healing
when
the
observed
area
is
found
markedly
greater
than
that
determined
by
the
ideal
curve
the
indication
is
that
there
is
still
infection
in
the
wound
a
rather
surprising
and
unexplained
situation
occurs
frequently
when
the
heals
more
rapidly
than
the
ideal
curve
would
indicate
in
this
event
secondary
ulcers
develop
which
bring
the
curve
back
to
normal
this
application
of
mathematics
to
medicine
is
largely
due
to
alexis
carrel
of
the
rockefeller
institute
of
medical
research
he
noted
that
the
larger
the
the
more
rapidly
it
healed
and
that
the
rate
of
healing
seemed
to
be
proportional
to
the
area
this
proportionality
constant
is
not
the
same
for
all
values
of
the
surface
or
we
would
have
an
equation
of
the
form
in
which
is
the
area
at
the
time
that
the
wound
is
rendered
sterile

there
is
every
reason

low

engineering
and
the
arts
of
engineering
by
their
very
nature
are
derived
from
the
work
of
dead
men
and
destined
to
serve
not
only
the
present
but
the
future
they
are
freer
than
any
other
human
activity
from
the
errors
of
intermixing
dimensions
and
from
the
fallacy
of
belief
in
individualistic
accomplishment
and
pride
the
simple
steel
structure
of
a
bridge
familiar
to
us
in
every
day
life
is
a
clear
reminder
to
us
all
of
the
arts
of
hephæstus
and
the
knowledge
of
countless
generations
of
smiths
and
mechanics
metallurgists
and
chemists
mathematicians
and
builders
teachers
and
engineers
who
toiled
for
many
thousands
of
years
to
make
possible
the
riveted
steel
beams
which
are
the
elements
of
modern
structure
these
structures
do
not
collapse
unless
the
natural
laws
for
their
construction
are
transgressed
which
seldom
no
one
is
entrusted
with
the
work
unless
he
has
bound
up
in
his
knowledge
the
accumulated
experience
of
the
past
yet
the
transgressors
of
these
natural
laws
are
punished
with
all
the
severity
of
the
common
law
when
a
bridge
is
opened
and
tested
the
written
laws
in
some
countries
and
the
unwritten
in
others
and
the
pride
and
the
sense
of
responsibility
of
the
designer
and
builder
of
the
bridge
demand
that
he
the
creator
of
the
bridge
be
the
first
to
enter
it
and
the
last
to
leave
it
and
should
the
bridge
collapse
he
has
to
take
the
immediate
consequences
of
his
neglect
of
the
laws
rarely
are
the
affairs
of
engineering
done
with
the
entirely
selfish
motive
of
merely
acquiring
immediate
selfish
gain
for
even
when
this
could
be
unworthy
thought
disappears
in
the
halo
of
the
glory
of
the
accomplishment
eiffel
did
not
erect
his
tower
to
haunt
paris
with
the
sight
of
a
steel
skeleton
towering
over
the
city
of
daring
thoughts
his
tower
stands
as
a
mechanical
proof
of
mathematical
formulas
proving
the
possibility
of
erecting
tall
structures
and
thereby
serving
future
humanity
the
capacity
of
humans
creates
and
formulates
new
values
for
the
service
of
mankind
again
no
student
of
the
arts
of
engineering
could
ever
forget
himself
to
the
point
of
claiming
his
accomplishments
no
matter
how
marvelous
all
to
himself
no
wondrous
discovery
of
modern
electricity
not
even
the
talking
from
one
hemisphere
to
another
is
rightly
the
accomplishment
of
any
one
man
for
the
origin
of
the
discovery
can
be
traced
at
least
as
far
back
as
the
days
of
that
barefooted
shepherd
boy
magnus
who
first
observed
the
phenomena
of
magnetism
in
an
attempt
to
trace
and
evaluate
the
faculties
manifested
in
the
arts
of
engineering
one
is
at
once
astonished
and
bewildered
at
the
confusion
and
contradictions
unrealized
in
the
mass
of
evidence
and
how
pathetic
and
deplorable
is
the
sight
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
workers
in
the
field
of
engineering
toil
and
creation
who
unconsciously
submit
to
the
degradation
in
silent
consent
of
seeing
their
marvelous
collective
achievements
chained
to
aims
upon
the
completion
of
this
book
i
was
astonished
that
there
are
such
a
small
number
of
engineers
who
have
the
intuitive
feeling
of
the
greatness
of
the
assets
at
their
command
and
of
the
gravity
of
their
liabilities
concerning
affairs
of
humanity
i
was
eager
to
have
my
book
read
and
analysed
by
a
few
leading
engineers
the
late
gantt
being
no
more
with
us
i
then
turned
to
walter
polakov
doctor
of
engineering
industrial
counselor
chairman
of
committee
on
service
and
information
fuels
section
and
robert
wolf
of
in
them
i
found
to
the
full
a
very
sympathetic
understanding
and
my
esteem
grew
as
i
became
more
intimately
acquainted
with
the
character
of
their
work
and
their
accomplishments
both
have
done
a
most
remarkable
work
in
their
respective
lines
it
will
not
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
their
work
together
with
the
work
of
the
late
gantt
and
charles
steinmetz
may
be
considered
as
the
my
of
the
science
and
art
of
human
engineering
and
form
the
first
few
volumes
and
writings
for
the
new
library
of
the
manhood
of
humanity
these
books
and
pamphlets
are
based
on
facts
analysed
scientifically
marking
the
parting
of
the
way
of
engineering
thought
from
the
past
subjection
to
speculative
fetishes
of
all
the
pure
and
applied
sciences
engineering
alone
has
the
distinction
of
being
the
first
to
have
the
insight
into
the
human
problem
the
task
of
engineers
was
to
convert
time
daily
bread
by
means
of
conserving
time
and
effort
this
concept
is
naught
else
but
the
working
out
of
the
imperfect
formulation
of
the
principle
it
was
inevitable
therefore
that
some
engineers
had
already
beaten
the
path
in
the
right
direction
how
straight
and
how
far
this
sense
of
dimensionality
has
led
some
of
them
in
their
practical
work
may
be
seen
from
the
work
of
walter
polakov
in
his
power
engineering
magazine
it
was
not
my
intention
to
compile
a
text
book
on
power
engineering
it
was
rather
my
care
to
avoid
the
treatment
of
any
technical
subject
which
could
be
found
elsewhere
in
engineering
literature
but
i
could
not
avoid
trespassing
in
the
adjoining
fields
of
psychology
and
economics
for
without
familiarity
with
these
sciences
the
mastery
of
power
production
is
a
futile
attempt
i
do
not
hold
that
the
principles
upon
which
the
method
is
laid
out
are
subject
to
choice
or
opinions
for
they
are
based
on
facts
yet
work
of
this
character
can
not
be
complete
or
examples
may
be
illy
chosen
for
it
deals
with
living
and
constantly
reshaping
relations
and
applies
to
things
in
process
of
development
if
this
work
and
its
underlying
idea
will
facilitate
the
solving
of
some
of
the
problems
now
in
the
course
of
rapid
evolution
in
our
industrial
relations
i
shall
feel
that
my
own
and
my
readers
time
have
not
been
altogether
indeed
the
readers
time
will
not
be
lost
this
book
gives
an
engineering
the
meantime
of
all
human
problems
it
is
a
deep
and
practical
treatise
on
all
great
questions
concerning
modern
industrialism
and
economic
problems
and
is
a
foundation
for
a
new
scientific
industrial
philosophy
another
very
clear
outline
of
the
of
industrial
was
given
by
polakov
in
his
paper
presented
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
american
society
of
mechanical
engineers
december
anyone
who
has
anything
to
do
with
industrial
or
economic
problems
can
not
afford
to
overlook
the
important
and
fundamental
work
in
this
book
it
is
obvious
that
a
scientific
knowledge
of
facts
is
of
the
greatest
importance
for
anyone
who
cares
to
approach
any
problem
in
a
serious
way
statistics
which
are
are
therefore
of
primary
importance
i
had
the
privilege
of
reading
the
manuscript
of
vadis
the
forthcoming
book
of
polakov
where
a
most
valuable
statistical
picture
of
facts
in
modern
america
is
given
and
the
astonishing
conclusions
which
are
to
be
drawn
therefrom
i
can
only
regret
that
in
europe
we
have
not
such
a
knowledge
written
down
concerning
european
conditions
if
more
such
books
had
been
written
and
by
the
public
many
crises
and
catastrophes
would
have
been
avoided
the
outstanding
contribution
of
robert
wolf
to
engineering
was
made
in
his
study
of
physiology
biology
psychology
and
philosophy
as
applied
to
engineering
if
anyone
wishes
to
inquire
into
the
forces
which
have
led
up
to
the
individual
development
of
mankind
he
will
find
himself
at
once
plunged
into
the
realm
of
psychology
and
mental
philosophy
i
can
heartily
recommend
such
a
course
as
immensely
profitable
and
of
practical
value
the
five
important
facts
however
that
have
to
do
with
the
subject
in
hand
are
that
the
human
body
is
such
a
wonderful
organization
because
it
is
the
product
of
the
forces
of
creation
acting
through
millions
of
years
of
evolution
that
its
capacity
for
progress
depends
upon
the
maintenance
of
the
unity
resulting
from
this
creative
evolution
and
upon
a
conscious
recognition
of
this
unity
that
this
unity
would
not
have
been
possible
without
the
development
of
the
nervous
system
that
the
conscious
intelligent
progress
made
by
mankind
could
not
have
reached
its
present
level
until
in
the
process
of
evolution
a
mechanism
had
been
built
up
in
the
nervous
system
itself
capable
of
recording
the
various
impressions
which
the
senses
are
constantly
receiving
that
the
recording
of
past
events
with
the
power
of
consciously
recalling
them
for
the
solution
of
problems
immediately
confronting
it
is
absolutely
essential
to
its
development
now
what
i
want
to
point
out
is
that
inasmuch
as
man
s
progress
depends
upon
the
perfect
of
his
forces
to
produce
unity
of
action
we
have
no
right
to
expect
an
industrial
organization
to
make
progress
which
it
must
do
as
a
unit
without
the
establishment
of
a
conscious
mechanism
similar
to
the
nervous
system
in
the
human
in
by
robert
wolf
doctor
charles
steinmetz
has
given
in
his
and
the
new
a
most
correct
engineering
picture
of
the
political
situation
in
the
world
with
a
fine
characterization
of
the
psychological
peculiarities
of
the
different
races
although
this
book
was
written
in
that
is
before
the
end
of
the
world
war
it
will
be
of
permanent
value
because
of
its
deep
psychological
analysis
of
the
peoples
and
their
institutions
which
ultimately
shape
the
development
of
any
nation
and
which
do
not
change
with
victory
or
defeat
my
tribute
to
the
memory
of
gantt
will
be
not
only
the
homage
of
a
friend
and
admirer
but
the
proof
that
his
philosophy
is
scientifically
true
a
rigorous
proof
is
necessary
because
the
word
service
belongs
to
that
category
of
words
the
meaning
of
which
can
be
completely
reversed
by
the
verb
be
it
give
or
gantt
took
rendering
service
as
an
axiom
my
observation
shared
with
many
others
is
that
our
civilization
had
quite
another
axiom
we
preach
give
we
practice
the
problem
which
interested
me
was
how
to
find
a
way
out
of
this
contradiction
that
would
be
irrefutable
if
one
of
them
is
true
and
natural
law
for
humans
then
the
other
is
not
if
our
words
are
true
then
our
deeds
are
not
true
or
if
our
deeds
are
true
then
the
words
are
camouflage
i
found
the
solution
by
applying
mathematically
rigorous
thinking
mathematics
with
its
exact
concept
of
dimensions
gave
me
the
method
the
method
we
use
in
studying
phenomena
is
analysis
or
speaking
mathematically
differentiation
i
soon
found
that
the
methods
of
differentiation
are
mostly
correct
but
our
synthesis
or
process
of
integration
made
by
the
use
of
metaphysics
was
faulty
the
differentiation
correctly
lowered
the
dimensions
but
our
faulty
integration
did
not
restore
the
original
dimensions
the
investigation
had
to
be
made
from
the
beginning
by
defining
the
phenomena
of
life
in
a
specific
way
which
would
not
permit
of
any
blunders
in
dimensions
i
defined
the
classes
of
life
by
emphasizing
their
incontestable
dimensional
characteristics
plants
are
animals
are
humans
are
classes
of
life
these
definitions
have
the
peculiarity
that
they
make
it
obvious
that
the
classes
of
life
have
different
dimensions
and
that
the
intermixing
of
dimensions
as
in
mathematics
it
makes
a
correct
solution
impossible
so
in
life
the
results
of
such
elementary
mistakes
produce
tragic
consequences
the
old
formula
on
which
our
civilization
is
built
human
equal
animal
plus
or
multiplied
by
spark
of
divinity
is
basically
and
elementarily
wrong
and
is
mathematical
nonsense
which
is
identical
to
such
an
absurdity
as
square
inches
equal
linear
inches
plus
or
multiplied
by
cubic
inches
a
basically
wrong
formula
on
which
our
civilization
rests
is
the
cause
of
all
the
periodical
collapses
wars
and
revolutions
the
old
system
was
built
on
animal
standards
and
human
impulses
were
all
the
time
in
rebellion
as
the
theory
of
gravitation
and
the
calculus
made
engineers
and
mathematicians
masters
of
inanimate
nature
so
these
tangible
and
incontestable
definitions
give
them
a
positive
base
which
will
enable
them
to
approach
and
solve
human
living
problems
by
establishing
the
mathematical
fact
that
man
is
man
not
an
animal
all
of
those
who
are
blinded
by
traditions
and
refuse
to
investigate
or
to
know
these
mathematical
truths
are
a
danger
to
humanity
in
directly
helping
to
obscure
issues
and
in
helping
to
maintain
the
faulty
structure
which
as
in
the
past
is
bound
to
collapse
again
and
again
in
the
future
the
duty
of
mathematically
thinking
people
is
to
throw
such
light
on
this
problem
as
will
stop
the
stupid
or
willfully
destructive
and
show
whether
they
are
working
for
or
against
mankind
for
the
class
of
life
it
is
obvious
then
that
in
this
dimension
is
the
natural
law
and
if
understood
and
analysed
it
is
the
highest
human
aim
such
natural
laws
as
survival
of
the
fittest
for
animals
which
is
the
survival
of
the
fittest
in
space
result
in
fight
or
the
survival
of
the
strongest
whereas
such
a
law
to
be
a
natural
law
for
humans
must
be
in
the
human
dimension
which
obviously
would
be
the
survival
of
the
fittest
in
time
resulting
in
the
survival
of
the
best
all
known
facts
must
be
brought
to
the
light
to
be
summed
up
and
correlated
by
mathematicians
and
engineers
with
the
strictest
attention
to
dimensionality
all
of
our
ideas
have
to
be
revised
the
animal
standards
must
be
rejected
as
dangerous
and
destructive
must
be
replaced
by
standards
which
will
correspond
to
the
natural
impulses
and
natural
laws
for
humans
the
minds
of
mathematicians
and
engineers
are
by
education
the
first
to
see
the
far
reaching
importance
of
the
facts
disclosed
by
these
definitions
and
just
this
realization
will
bring
about
the
readjustment
of
values
in
life
to
a
human
dimension
wherein
pending
revolutions
and
wars
could
be
turned
into
evolution
destruction
into
construction
discord
into
accord
of
a
common
aim
we
are
the
masters
of
our
own
destinies
the
responsibility
is
ours
to
correct
the
mistakes
of
our
ancestors
and
to
establish
a
scientific
philosophy
scientifically
true
laws
scientifically
true
ethics
and
a
scientific
sociology
which
will
form
one
unified
science
of
man
and
his
function
in
the
universe
a
science
which
i
propose
to
call
human
gantt
s
methods
would
be
the
first
practical
application
toward
this
end
gantt
s
concept
of
rendering
service
is
scientifically
true
because
it
is
and
therefore
true
for
the
human
class
of
life
and
in

dimension
this
is
why
gantt

footnotes
to
digress
a
bit
it
may
be
interesting
to
add
that
population
and
the
need
of
people
increase
in
a
geometrical
progression
and
also
that
the
growth
of
individuals
is
limited
by
the
fact
that
they
have
to
absorb
their
food
through
surfaces
which
as
growth
goes
on
increase
only
as
while
the
bodies
to
be
fed
being
volumes
increase
in
size
as
increase
as
the
cubes
of
the
same
base
grow
faster
than
the
squares
and
so
on
it
is
obvious
that
in
the
infancy
of
an
organism
only
a
part
of
the
food
goes
to
maintain
life
the
larger
part
goes
for
growth
when
the
organism
becomes
larger
the
absorbing
surfaces
growing
proportionally
to
the
square
the
food
is
spent
to
build
the
mass
of
the
volume
of
the
body
and
is
spent
proportionally
to
the
cube
suppose
our
organism
has
grown
to
a
size
twice
as
large
its
absorbing
capacity
has
become
four
times
larger
its
volume
eight
times
larger
in
case
of
times
the
difference
will
be
and
it
is
obvious
that
at
some
point
all
the
absorbed
food
will
be
used
to
maintain
life
and
none
will
be
left
for
growth
and
this
last
process
will
stop
this
is
another
example
which
explains
how
the
theory
of
dimensions
is
vitally
important
in
life
and
shows
why
it
is
absolutely
essential
to
take
account
of
dimensions

the

and
it
may
be
contended
by
some
that
animals
have
been
making
progress
or
some
may
say
that
animals
also
this
use
of
words
would
again
become
mere
verbalism
a
mere
talking
about
speculation
having
nothing
to
do
with
or
with
correct
thinking
in
which
there
is
no
intermixing
of
dimensions
the
peculiar
faculty
belonging
exclusively
to
humans
which
i
designate
as
i
have
clearly
defined
as
an
of
in
the
following
chapter
if
people
are
pleased
to
talk
about
the
progress
of
animals
they
can
hardly
fail
to
see
clearly
that
it
differs
both
in
function
and
in
type
or
dimension
from
what
is
rightly
meant
by
human
progress
human
capacity
lies
in
an
entirely
different
dimension
from
that
of
animals
so
if
any
persons
wish
to
talk
of
animal
progress
or
animal
they
should
invent
a
suitable
word
for
it
to
save
them
from
the
blunder
of
confusing
types
or
mixing
dimensions
this
mathematical
discrimination
between
classes
types
dimensions
is
of
the
utmost
importance
in
the
natural
sciences
because
of
the
transmutation
of
species
to
adjust
the
darwin
theory
to
dimensionality
is
a
somewhat
more
difficult
problem
it
involves
the
concept
of
the
continuum
but
with
the
modern
theory
of
de
vries
these
things
are
self
evident
if
animals
really
progress
which
is
doubtful
because
they
are
an
older
form
of
life
than
humans
and
they
have
not
shown
any
noticeable
progress
to
the
knowledge
of
man
their
progress
is
so
small
in
comparison
with
man
s
that
it
may
be
said
in
mathematical
terms
to
be
as
an
infinitesimal
of
higher
order
it
must
be
remembered
here
that
our
world
is
first
of
all
a
dynamic
conglomeration
of
matter
and
energy
which
as
well
as
in
the
first
period
of
primitive
organic
life
took
and
takes
different
known
and
unknown
forms
one
of
these
forms
of
energy
is
the
chemical
energy
with
its
tendency
to
combinations
and
exchanges
different
elements
act
in
different
ways
the
history
of
the
earth
and
its
life
is
simply
the
history
of
different
chemical
periods
with
different
transformations
of
energy
a
strange
fact
is
to
be
noticed
about
nitrogen
nitrogen
chemically
has
an
exceptional
inertness
toward
most
other
substances
but
once
it
is
a
component
part
of
a
substance
almost
all
of
these
combinations
are
a
very
powerful
source
of
energy
and
all
of
them
have
a
very
strong
effect
upon
organic
life
nitric
acid
acts
through
oxidation
the
substances
are
burned
up
by
the
oxygen
given
off
from
the
acid
nitric
acid
occurs
in
nature
in
a
combination
called
nitrates
from
the
soil
the
nitrates
pass
into
the
plant
nitrite
of
amyl
acts
upon
our
organs
in
a
most
violent
and
spasmodic
way
nitrous
oxide
is
the
laughing
gas
alkaloids
are
compounds
of
a
vegetable
origin
generally
of
complex
composition
and
capable
of
producing
marked
effects
upon
animals
they
all
contain
nitrogen
explosives
which
are
a
chemical
means
of
storing
tremendous
amounts
of
energy
are
mostly
of
some
nitrogenous
compound
albumen
is
an
organic
compound
of
great
importance
in
life
which
besides
being
the
characteristic
ingredient
in
the
white
of
an
egg
abounds
in
the
serum
of
the
blood
and
forms
an
important
part
of
the
muscles
and
brain
albuminoids
play
the
most
vital
rôle
in
plant
life
and
are
an
extensive
class
of
organic
bodies
found
in
plants
and
animals
as
they
are
found
to
form
the
chief
constituents
of
blood
nerves
all
albuminoids
found
in
animals
are
produced
by
the
processes
fulfilled
in
plants
their
exact
constitution
is
not
known
analysis
shows
that
they
contain
approximately
carbon
hydrogen
nitrogen
oxygen
sulphur
venous
blood
contains
in
volumes
nitrogen
carbonic

arterial

carbonic

oxygen
nitrogenous
compounds
in
general
are
extremely
prone
to
decomposition
their
decomposition
often
involving
a
sudden
and
great
evolution
of
force
we
see
that
substances
classed
as
ferments
are
all
nitrogenous
and
we
see
that
even
in
organisms
and
parts
of
organisms
where
the
activities
are
least
such
changes
as
do
take
place
are
initiated
by
a
substance
containing
nitrogen
we
see
that
organic
matter
is
so
constituted
that
small
incidental
actions
are
capable
of
initiating
great
reaction
and
liberating
large
quantities
of
power
the
seed
of
a
plant
contains
nitrogenous
substances
in
a
far
higher
ratio
than
the
rest
of
the
plant
and
the
seed
differs
from
the
rest
of
the
plant
in
its
ability
to
initiate
extensive
vital
changes
constituting
germination
similarly
in
the
bodies
of
animals
in
every
living
vegetal
cell
there
is
a
certain
part
that
contains
nitrogen
this
part
initiates
these
changes
which
constitute
the
development
of
the
cell
it
is
a
curious
and
significant
fact
that
in
technology
we
not
only
utilize
the
same
principle
of
initiating
extensive
changes
among
comparatively
stable
compounds
by
the
help
of
compounds
much
less
stable
but
we
employ
for
the
purpose
compounds
of
the
same
general
class
our
modern
method
of
firing
a
gun
is
to
place
in
close
proximity
with
the
gunpowder
which
we
choose
to
decompose
or
explode
a
small
portion
of
fulminating
powder
which
is
decomposed
or
exploded
with
extreme
facility
and
which
on
decomposing
communicates
the
consequent
molecular
disturbances
to
the
less
easily
decomposed
gunpowder
when
we
ask
what
this
fulminating
powder
is
composed
of
we
find
that
it
is
a
nitrogenous
of
course
the
geometric
progression
does
not
represent
the
law
of
human
progression
it
is
here
employed
because
it
is
familiar
and
serves
better
perhaps
than
any
other
simple
mathematical
means
to
show
how
human
progress
goes
on
the
essential
elements
of
a
progression
are
the
first
term
and
the
ratio
and
the
number
of
the
terms
in
the
human
progression
is
the
starting
status
of
the
first
generation
is
the
peculiar
capacity
of
humans
to
bind
time
and
is
a
and
of
which
it
would
be
folly
not
to
recognize
and
accept
as
such
is
time
or
number
of
generations
it
is
obvious
that
the
magnitude
is
entirely
dependent
on
the
magnitudes
of
and
the
existence
of
and
is
independent
of
humans
being
a
law
of
nature
a
gift
of
nature
the
starting
status
of
the
initial
generation
with
or
there
would
be
no
progress
or
progression
at
all
each
term
in
the
case
of
human
progression
is
mainly
dependent
upon
the
time
and
the
work
done
by
the
dead
the
existence
of
and
is
entirely
beyond
human
control
humans
can
control
only
the
magnitude
of
those
elements
by
education
here
comes
the
tremendous
responsibility
of
education
it
is
not
necessary
to
use
much
imagination
to
see
that
if
humanity
had
always
been
rightly
educated
science
would
have
long
ago
discovered
the
natural
forces
and
laws
essential
to
human
welfare
and
human
misery
would
be
relatively
small
