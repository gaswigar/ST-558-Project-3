a
journey
to
the
western
islands
of
scotland
inch
keith
i
had
desired
to
visit
the
hebrides
or
western
islands
of
scotland
so
long
that
i
scarcely
remember
how
the
wish
was
originally
excited
and
was
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
induced
to
undertake
the
journey
by
finding
in
boswell
a
companion
whose
acuteness
would
help
my
inquiry
and
whose
gaiety
of
conversation
and
civility
of
manners
are
sufficient
to
counteract
the
inconveniences
of
travel
in
countries
less
hospitable
than
we
have
passed
on
the
eighteenth
of
august
we
left
edinburgh
a
city
too
well
known
to
admit
description
and
directed
our
course
northward
along
the
eastern
coast
of
scotland
accompanied
the
first
day
by
another
gentleman
who
could
stay
with
us
only
long
enough
to
shew
us
how
much
we
lost
at
separation
as
we
crossed
the
frith
of
forth
our
curiosity
was
attracted
by
inch
keith
a
small
island
which
neither
of
my
companions
had
ever
visited
though
lying
within
their
view
it
had
all
their
lives
solicited
their
notice
here
by
climbing
with
some
difficulty
over
shattered
crags
we
made
the
first
experiment
of
unfrequented
coasts
inch
keith
is
nothing
more
than
a
rock
covered
with
a
thin
layer
of
earth
not
wholly
bare
of
grass
and
very
fertile
of
thistles
a
small
herd
of
cows
grazes
annually
upon
it
in
the
summer
it
seems
never
to
have
afforded
to
man
or
beast
a
permanent
habitation
we
found
only
the
ruins
of
a
small
fort
not
so
injured
by
time
but
that
it
might
be
easily
restored
to
its
former
state
it
seems
never
to
have
been
intended
as
a
place
of
strength
nor
was
built
to
endure
a
siege
but
merely
to
afford
cover
to
a
few
soldiers
who
perhaps
had
the
charge
of
a
battery
or
were
stationed
to
give
signals
of
approaching
danger
there
is
therefore
no
provision
of
water
within
the
walls
though
the
spring
is
so
near
that
it
might
have
been
easily
enclosed
one
of
the
stones
had
this
inscription
reg
it
has
probably
been
neglected
from
the
time
that
the
whole
island
had
the
same
king
we
left
this
little
island
with
our
thoughts
employed
awhile
on
the
different
appearance
that
it
would
have
made
if
it
had
been
placed
at
the
same
distance
from
london
with
the
same
facility
of
approach
with
what
emulation
of
price
a
few
rocky
acres
would
have
been
purchased
and
with
what
expensive
industry
they
would
have
been
cultivated
and
adorned
when
we
landed
we
found
our
chaise
ready
and
passed
through
kinghorn
kirkaldy
and
cowpar
places
not
unlike
the
small
or
straggling
towns
in
those
parts
of
england
where
commerce
and
manufactures
have
not
yet
produced
opulence
though
we
were
yet
in
the
most
populous
part
of
scotland
and
at
so
small
a
distance
from
the
capital
we
met
few
passengers
the
roads
are
neither
rough
nor
dirty
and
it
affords
a
southern
stranger
a
new
kind
of
pleasure
to
travel
so
commodiously
without
the
interruption
of
where
the
bottom
is
rocky
as
it
seems
commonly
to
be
in
scotland
a
smooth
way
is
made
indeed
with
great
labour
but
it
never
wants
repairs
and
in
those
parts
where
adventitious
materials
are
necessary
the
ground
once
consolidated
is
rarely
broken
for
the
inland
commerce
is
not
great
nor
are
heavy
commodities
often
transported
otherwise
than
by
water
the
carriages
in
common
use
are
small
carts
drawn
each
by
one
little
horse
and
a
man
seems
to
derive
some
degree
of
dignity
and
importance
from
the
reputation
of
possessing
a
cart
andrews
at
an
hour
somewhat
late
we
came
to
andrews
a
city
once
archiepiscopal
where
that
university
still
subsists
in
which
philosophy
was
formerly
taught
by
buchanan
whose
name
has
as
fair
a
claim
to
immortality
as
can
be
conferred
by
modern
latinity
and
perhaps
a
fairer
than
the
instability
of
vernacular
languages
admits
we
found
that
by
the
interposition
of
some
invisible
friend
lodgings
had
been
provided
for
us
at
the
house
of
one
of
the
professors
whose
easy
civility
quickly
made
us
forget
that
we
were
strangers
and
in
the
whole
time
of
our
stay
we
were
gratified
by
every
mode
of
kindness
and
entertained
with
all
the
elegance
of
lettered
hospitality
in
the
morning
we
rose
to
perambulate
a
city
which
only
history
shews
to
have
once
flourished
and
surveyed
the
ruins
of
ancient
magnificence
of
which
even
the
ruins
can
not
long
be
visible
unless
some
care
be
taken
to
preserve
them
and
where
is
the
pleasure
of
preserving
such
mournful
memorials
they
have
been
till
very
lately
so
much
neglected
that
every
man
carried
away
the
stones
who
fancied
that
he
wanted
them
the
cathedral
of
which
the
foundations
may
be
still
traced
and
a
small
part
of
the
wall
is
standing
appears
to
have
been
a
spacious
and
majestick
building
not
unsuitable
to
the
primacy
of
the
kingdom
of
the
architecture
the
poor
remains
can
hardly
exhibit
even
to
an
artist
a
sufficient
specimen
it
was
demolished
as
is
well
known
in
the
tumult
and
violence
of
knox
reformation
not
far
from
the
cathedral
on
the
margin
of
the
water
stands
a
fragment
of
the
castle
in
which
the
archbishop
anciently
resided
it
was
never
very
large
and
was
built
with
more
attention
to
security
than
pleasure
cardinal
beatoun
is
said
to
have
had
workmen
employed
in
improving
its
fortifications
at
the
time
when
he
was
murdered
by
the
ruffians
of
reformation
in
the
manner
of
which
knox
has
given
what
he
himself
calls
a
merry
narrative
the
change
of
religion
in
scotland
eager
and
vehement
as
it
was
raised
an
epidemical
enthusiasm
compounded
of
sullen
scrupulousness
and
warlike
ferocity
which
in
a
people
whom
idleness
resigned
to
their
own
thoughts
and
who
conversing
only
with
each
other
suffered
no
dilution
of
their
zeal
from
the
gradual
influx
of
new
opinions
was
long
transmitted
in
its
full
strength
from
the
old
to
the
young
but
by
trade
and
intercourse
with
england
is
now
visibly
abating
and
giving
way
too
fast
to
that
laxity
of
practice
and
indifference
of
opinion
in
which
men
not
sufficiently
instructed
to
find
the
middle
point
too
easily
shelter
themselves
from
rigour
and
constraint
the
city
of
andrews
when
it
had
lost
its
archiepiscopal
gradually
decayed
one
of
its
streets
is
now
lost
and
in
those
that
remain
there
is
silence
and
solitude
of
inactive
indigence
and
gloomy
depopulation
the
university
within
a
few
years
consisted
of
three
colleges
but
is
now
reduced
to
two
the
college
of
leonard
being
lately
dissolved
by
the
sale
of
its
buildings
and
the
appropriation
of
its
revenues
to
the
professors
of
the
two
others
the
chapel
of
the
alienated
college
is
yet
standing
a
fabrick
not
inelegant
of
external
structure
but
i
was
always
by
some
civil
excuse
hindred
from
entering
it
a
decent
attempt
as
i
was
since
told
has
been
made
to
convert
it
into
a
kind
of
by
planting
its
area
with
shrubs
this
new
method
of
gardening
is
unsuccessful
the
plants
do
not
hitherto
prosper
to
what
use
it
will
next
be
put
i
have
no
pleasure
in
conjecturing
it
is
something
that
its
present
state
is
at
least
not
ostentatiously
displayed
where
there
is
yet
shame
there
may
in
time
be
virtue
the
dissolution
of
leonard
college
was
doubtless
necessary
but
of
that
necessity
there
is
reason
to
complain
it
is
surely
not
without
just
reproach
that
a
nation
of
which
the
commerce
is
hourly
extending
and
the
wealth
encreasing
denies
any
participation
of
its
prosperity
to
its
literary
societies
and
while
its
merchants
or
its
nobles
are
raising
palaces
suffers
its
universities
to
moulder
into
dust
of
the
two
colleges
yet
standing
one
is
by
the
institution
of
its
founder
appropriated
to
divinity
it
is
said
to
be
capable
of
containing
fifty
students
but
more
than
one
must
occupy
a
chamber
the
library
which
is
of
late
erection
is
not
very
spacious
but
elegant
and
luminous
the
doctor
by
whom
it
was
shewn
hoped
to
irritate
or
subdue
my
english
vanity
by
telling
me
that
we
had
no
such
repository
of
books
in
england
saint
andrews
seems
to
be
a
place
eminently
adapted
to
study
and
education
being
situated
in
a
populous
yet
a
cheap
country
and
exposing
the
minds
and
manners
of
young
men
neither
to
the
levity
and
dissoluteness
of
a
capital
city
nor
to
the
gross
luxury
of
a
town
of
commerce
places
naturally
unpropitious
to
learning
in
one
the
desire
of
knowledge
easily
gives
way
to
the
love
of
pleasure
and
in
the
other
is
in
danger
of
yielding
to
the
love
of
money
the
students
however
are
represented
as
at
this
time
not
exceeding
a
hundred
perhaps
it
may
be
some
obstruction
to
their
increase
that
there
is
no
episcopal
chapel
in
the
place
i
saw
no
reason
for
imputing
their
paucity
to
the
present
professors
nor
can
the
expence
of
an
academical
education
be
very
reasonably
objected
a
student
of
the
highest
class
may
keep
his
annual
session
or
as
the
english
call
it
his
term
which
lasts
seven
months
for
about
fifteen
pounds
and
one
of
lower
rank
for
less
than
ten
in
which
board
lodging
and
instruction
are
all
included
the
chief
magistrate
resident
in
the
university
answering
to
our
chancellor
and
to
the
on
the
continent
had
commonly
the
title
of
lord
rector
but
being
addressed
only
as
rector
in
an
inauguratory
speech
by
the
present
chancellor
he
has
fallen
from
his
former
dignity
of
style
lordship
was
very
liberally
annexed
by
our
ancestors
to
any
station
or
character
of
dignity
they
said
the
lord
general
and
lord
ambassador
so
we
still
say
my
lord
to
the
judge
upon
the
circuit
and
yet
retain
in
our
liturgy
the
lords
of
the
council
in
walking
among
the
ruins
of
religious
buildings
we
came
to
two
vaults
over
which
had
formerly
stood
the
house
of
the
one
of
the
vaults
was
inhabited
by
an
old
woman
who
claimed
the
right
of
abode
there
as
the
widow
of
a
man
whose
ancestors
had
possessed
the
same
gloomy
mansion
for
no
less
than
four
generations
the
right
however
it
began
was
considered
as
established
by
legal
prescription
and
the
old
woman
lives
undisturbed
she
thinks
however
that
she
has
a
claim
to
something
more
than
sufferance
for
as
her
husband
name
was
bruce
she
is
allied
to
royalty
and
told
boswell
that
when
there
were
persons
of
quality
in
the
place
she
was
distinguished
by
some
notice
that
indeed
she
is
now
neglected
but
she
spins
a
thread
has
the
company
of
her
cat
and
is
troublesome
to
nobody
having
now
seen
whatever
this
ancient
city
offered
to
our
curiosity
we
left
it
with
good
wishes
having
reason
to
be
highly
pleased
with
the
attention
that
was
paid
us
but
whoever
surveys
the
world
must
see
many
things
that
give
him
pain
the
kindness
of
the
professors
did
not
contribute
to
abate
the
uneasy
remembrance
of
an
university
declining
a
college
alienated
and
a
church
profaned
and
hastening
to
the
ground
andrews
indeed
has
formerly
suffered
more
atrocious
ravages
and
more
extensive
destruction
but
recent
evils
affect
with
greater
force
we
were
reconciled
to
the
sight
of
archiepiscopal
ruins
the
distance
of
a
calamity
from
the
present
time
seems
to
preclude
the
mind
from
contact
or
sympathy
events
long
past
are
barely
known
they
are
not
considered
we
read
with
as
little
emotion
the
violence
of
knox
and
his
followers
as
the
irruptions
of
alaric
and
the
goths
had
the
university
been
destroyed
two
centuries
ago
we
should
not
have
regretted
it
but
to
see
it
pining
in
decay
and
struggling
for
life
fills
the
mind
with
mournful
images
and
ineffectual
wishes
aberbrothick
as
we
knew
sorrow
and
wishes
to
be
vain
it
was
now
our
business
to
mind
our
way
the
roads
of
scotland
afford
little
diversion
to
the
traveller
who
seldom
sees
himself
either
encountered
or
overtaken
and
who
has
nothing
to
contemplate
but
grounds
that
have
no
visible
boundaries
or
are
separated
by
walls
of
loose
stone
from
the
bank
of
the
tweed
to
andrews
i
had
never
seen
a
single
tree
which
i
did
not
believe
to
have
grown
up
far
within
the
present
century
now
and
then
about
a
gentleman
house
stands
a
small
plantation
which
in
scotch
is
called
a
policy
but
of
these
there
are
few
and
those
few
all
very
young
the
variety
of
sun
and
shade
is
here
utterly
unknown
there
is
no
tree
for
either
shelter
or
timber
the
oak
and
the
thorn
is
equally
a
stranger
and
the
whole
country
is
extended
in
uniform
nakedness
except
that
in
the
road
between
kirkaldy
and
cowpar
i
passed
for
a
few
yards
between
two
hedges
a
tree
might
be
a
show
in
scotland
as
a
horse
in
venice
at
andrews
boswell
found
only
one
and
recommended
it
to
my
notice
i
told
him
that
it
was
rough
and
low
or
looked
as
if
i
thought
so
this
said
he
is
nothing
to
another
a
few
miles
off
i
was
still
less
delighted
to
hear
that
another
tree
was
not
to
be
seen
nearer
nay
said
a
gentleman
that
stood
by
i
know
but
of
this
and
that
tree
in
the
county
the
lowlands
of
scotland
had
once
undoubtedly
an
equal
portion
of
woods
with
other
countries
forests
are
every
where
gradually
diminished
as
architecture
and
cultivation
prevail
by
the
increase
of
people
and
the
introduction
of
arts
but
i
believe
few
regions
have
been
denuded
like
this
where
many
centuries
must
have
passed
in
waste
without
the
least
thought
of
future
supply
davies
observes
in
his
account
of
ireland
that
no
irishman
had
ever
planted
an
orchard
for
that
negligence
some
excuse
might
be
drawn
from
an
unsettled
state
of
life
and
the
instability
of
property
but
in
scotland
possession
has
long
been
secure
and
inheritance
regular
yet
it
may
be
doubted
whether
before
the
union
any
man
between
edinburgh
and
england
had
ever
set
a
tree
of
this
improvidence
no
other
account
can
be
given
than
that
it
probably
began
in
times
of
tumult
and
continued
because
it
had
begun
established
custom
is
not
easily
broken
till
some
great
event
shakes
the
whole
system
of
things
and
life
seems
to
recommence
upon
new
principles
that
before
the
union
the
scots
had
little
trade
and
little
money
is
no
valid
apology
for
plantation
is
the
least
expensive
of
all
methods
of
improvement
to
drop
a
seed
into
the
ground
can
cost
nothing
and
the
trouble
is
not
great
of
protecting
the
young
plant
till
it
is
out
of
danger
though
it
must
be
allowed
to
have
some
difficulty
in
places
like
these
where
they
have
neither
wood
for
palisades
nor
thorns
for
hedges
our
way
was
over
the
firth
of
tay
where
though
the
water
was
not
wide
we
paid
four
shillings
for
ferrying
the
chaise
in
scotland
the
necessaries
of
life
are
easily
procured
but
superfluities
and
elegancies
are
of
the
same
price
at
least
as
in
england
and
therefore
may
be
considered
as
much
dearer
we
stopped
a
while
at
dundee
where
i
remember
nothing
remarkable
and
mounting
our
chaise
again
came
about
the
close
of
the
day
to
aberbrothick
the
monastery
of
aberbrothick
is
of
great
renown
in
the
history
of
scotland
its
ruins
afford
ample
testimony
of
its
ancient
magnificence
its
extent
might
i
suppose
easily
be
found
by
following
the
walls
among
the
grass
and
weeds
and
its
height
is
known
by
some
parts
yet
standing
the
arch
of
one
of
the
gates
is
entire
and
of
another
only
so
far
dilapidated
as
to
diversify
the
appearance
a
square
apartment
of
great
loftiness
is
yet
standing
its
use
i
could
not
conjecture
as
its
elevation
was
very
disproportionate
to
its
area
two
corner
towers
particularly
attracted
our
attention
boswell
whose
inquisitiveness
is
seconded
by
great
activity
scrambled
in
at
a
high
window
but
found
the
stairs
within
broken
and
could
not
reach
the
top
of
the
other
tower
we
were
told
that
the
inhabitants
sometimes
climbed
it
but
we
did
not
immediately
discern
the
entrance
and
as
the
night
was
gathering
upon
us
thought
proper
to
desist
men
skilled
in
architecture
might
do
what
we
did
not
attempt
they
might
probably
form
an
exact
of
this
venerable
edifice
they
may
from
some
parts
yet
standing
conjecture
its
general
form
and
perhaps
by
comparing
it
with
other
buildings
of
the
same
kind
and
the
same
age
attain
an
idea
very
near
to
truth
i
should
scarcely
have
regretted
my
journey
had
it
afforded
nothing
more
than
the
sight
of
aberbrothick
montrose
leaving
these
fragments
of
magnificence
we
travelled
on
to
montrose
which
we
surveyed
in
the
morning
and
found
it
well
built
airy
and
clean
the
townhouse
is
a
handsome
fabrick
with
a
portico
we
then
went
to
view
the
english
chapel
and
found
a
small
church
clean
to
a
degree
unknown
in
any
other
part
of
scotland
with
commodious
galleries
and
what
was
yet
less
expected
with
an
organ
at
our
inn
we
did
not
find
a
reception
such
as
we
thought
proportionate
to
the
commercial
opulence
of
the
place
but
boswell
desired
me
to
observe
that
the
innkeeper
was
an
englishman
and
i
then
defended
him
as
well
as
i
could
when
i
had
proceeded
thus
far
i
had
opportunities
of
observing
what
i
had
never
heard
that
there
are
many
beggars
in
scotland
in
edinburgh
the
proportion
is
i
think
not
less
than
in
london
and
in
the
smaller
places
it
is
far
greater
than
in
english
towns
of
the
same
extent
it
must
however
be
allowed
that
they
are
not
importunate
nor
clamorous
they
solicit
silently
or
very
modestly
and
therefore
though
their
behaviour
may
strike
with
more
force
the
heart
of
a
stranger
they
are
certainly
in
danger
of
missing
the
attention
of
their
countrymen
novelty
has
always
some
power
an
unaccustomed
mode
of
begging
excites
an
unaccustomed
degree
of
pity
but
the
force
of
novelty
is
by
its
own
nature
soon
at
an
end
the
efficacy
of
outcry
and
perseverance
is
permanent
and
certain
the
road
from
montrose
exhibited
a
continuation
of
the
same
appearances
the
country
is
still
naked
the
hedges
are
of
stone
and
the
fields
so
generally
plowed
that
it
is
hard
to
imagine
where
grass
is
found
for
the
horses
that
till
them
the
harvest
which
was
almost
ripe
appeared
very
plentiful
early
in
the
afternoon
boswell
observed
that
we
were
at
no
great
distance
from
the
house
of
lord
monboddo
the
magnetism
of
his
conversation
easily
drew
us
out
of
our
way
and
the
entertainment
which
we
received
would
have
been
a
sufficient
recompense
for
a
much
greater
deviation
the
roads
beyond
edinburgh
as
they
are
less
frequented
must
be
expected
to
grow
gradually
rougher
but
they
were
hitherto
by
no
means
incommodious
we
travelled
on
with
the
gentle
pace
of
a
scotch
driver
who
having
no
rivals
in
expedition
neither
gives
himself
nor
his
horses
unnecessary
trouble
we
did
not
affect
the
impatience
we
did
not
feel
but
were
satisfied
with
the
company
of
each
other
as
well
riding
in
the
chaise
as
sitting
at
an
inn
the
night
and
the
day
are
equally
solitary
and
equally
safe
for
where
there
are
so
few
travellers
why
should
there
be
robbers
aberdeen
we
came
somewhat
late
to
aberdeen
and
found
the
inn
so
full
that
we
had
some
difficulty
in
obtaining
admission
till
boswell
made
himself
known
his
name
overpowered
all
objection
and
we
found
a
very
good
house
and
civil
treatment
i
received
the
next
day
a
very
kind
letter
from
sir
alexander
gordon
whom
i
had
formerly
known
in
london
and
after
a
cessation
of
all
intercourse
for
near
twenty
years
met
here
professor
of
physic
in
the
king
college
such
unexpected
renewals
of
acquaintance
may
be
numbered
among
the
most
pleasing
incidents
of
life
the
knowledge
of
one
professor
soon
procured
me
the
notice
of
the
rest
and
i
did
not
want
any
token
of
regard
being
conducted
wherever
there
was
any
thing
which
i
desired
to
see
and
entertained
at
once
with
the
novelty
of
the
place
and
the
kindness
of
communication
to
write
of
the
cities
of
our
own
island
with
the
solemnity
of
geographical
description
as
if
we
had
been
cast
upon
a
newly
discovered
coast
has
the
appearance
of
very
frivolous
ostentation
yet
as
scotland
is
little
known
to
the
greater
part
of
those
who
may
read
these
observations
it
is
not
superfluous
to
relate
that
under
the
name
of
aberdeen
are
comprised
two
towns
standing
about
a
mile
distant
from
each
other
but
governed
i
think
by
the
same
magistrates
old
aberdeen
is
the
ancient
episcopal
city
in
which
are
still
to
be
seen
the
remains
of
the
cathedral
it
has
the
appearance
of
a
town
in
decay
having
been
situated
in
times
when
commerce
was
yet
unstudied
with
very
little
attention
to
the
commodities
of
the
harbour
new
aberdeen
has
all
the
bustle
of
prosperous
trade
and
all
the
shew
of
increasing
opulence
it
is
built
by
the
the
houses
are
large
and
lofty
and
the
streets
spacious
and
clean
they
build
almost
wholly
with
the
granite
used
in
the
new
pavement
of
the
streets
of
london
which
is
well
known
not
to
want
hardness
yet
they
shape
it
easily
it
is
beautiful
and
must
be
very
lasting
what
particular
parts
of
commerce
are
chiefly
exercised
by
the
merchants
of
aberdeen
i
have
not
inquired
the
manufacture
which
forces
itself
upon
a
stranger
eye
is
that
of
on
which
the
women
of
the
lower
class
are
visibly
employed
in
each
of
these
towns
there
is
a
college
or
in
stricter
language
an
university
for
in
both
there
are
professors
of
the
same
parts
of
learning
and
the
colleges
hold
their
sessions
and
confer
degrees
separately
with
total
independence
of
one
on
the
other
in
old
aberdeen
stands
the
king
college
of
which
the
first
president
was
hector
boece
or
boethius
who
may
be
justly
reverenced
as
one
of
the
revivers
of
elegant
learning
when
he
studied
at
paris
he
was
acquainted
with
erasmus
who
afterwards
gave
him
a
public
testimony
of
his
esteem
by
inscribing
to
him
a
catalogue
of
his
works
the
stile
of
boethius
though
perhaps
not
always
rigorously
pure
is
formed
with
great
diligence
upon
ancient
models
and
wholly
uninfected
with
monastic
barbarity
his
history
is
written
with
elegance
and
vigour
but
his
fabulousness
and
credulity
are
justly
blamed
his
fabulousness
if
he
was
the
author
of
the
fictions
is
a
fault
for
which
no
apology
can
be
made
but
his
credulity
may
be
excused
in
an
age
when
all
men
were
credulous
learning
was
then
rising
on
the
world
but
ages
so
long
accustomed
to
darkness
were
too
much
dazzled
with
its
light
to
see
any
thing
distinctly
the
first
race
of
scholars
in
the
fifteenth
century
and
some
time
after
were
for
the
most
part
learning
to
speak
rather
than
to
think
and
were
therefore
more
studious
of
elegance
than
of
truth
the
contemporaries
of
boethius
thought
it
sufficient
to
know
what
the
ancients
had
delivered
the
examination
of
tenets
and
of
facts
was
reserved
for
another
generation
boethius
as
president
of
the
university
enjoyed
a
revenue
of
forty
scottish
marks
about
two
pounds
four
shillings
and
sixpence
of
sterling
money
in
the
present
age
of
trade
and
taxes
it
is
difficult
even
for
the
imagination
so
to
raise
the
value
of
money
or
so
to
diminish
the
demands
of
life
as
to
suppose
four
and
forty
shillings
a
year
an
honourable
stipend
yet
it
was
probably
equal
not
only
to
the
needs
but
to
the
rank
of
boethius
the
wealth
of
england
was
undoubtedly
to
that
of
scotland
more
than
five
to
one
and
it
is
known
that
henry
the
eighth
among
whose
faults
avarice
was
never
reckoned
granted
to
roger
ascham
as
a
reward
of
his
learning
a
pension
of
ten
pounds
a
year
the
other
called
the
marischal
college
is
in
the
new
town
the
hall
is
large
and
well
lighted
one
of
its
ornaments
is
the
picture
of
arthur
johnston
who
was
principal
of
the
college
and
who
holds
among
the
latin
poets
of
scotland
the
next
place
to
the
elegant
buchanan
in
the
library
i
was
shewn
some
curiosities
a
hebrew
manuscript
of
exquisite
penmanship
and
a
latin
translation
of
aristotle
politicks
by
leonardus
aretinus
written
in
the
roman
character
with
nicety
and
beauty
which
as
the
art
of
printing
has
made
them
no
longer
necessary
are
not
now
to
be
found
this
was
one
of
the
latest
performances
of
the
transcribers
for
aretinus
died
but
about
twenty
years
before
typography
was
invented
this
version
has
been
printed
and
may
be
found
in
libraries
but
is
little
read
for
the
same
books
have
been
since
translated
both
by
victorius
and
lambinus
who
lived
in
an
age
more
cultivated
but
perhaps
owed
in
part
to
aretinus
that
they
were
able
to
excel
him
much
is
due
to
those
who
first
broke
the
way
to
knowledge
and
left
only
to
their
successors
the
task
of
smoothing
it
in
both
these
colleges
the
methods
of
instruction
are
nearly
the
same
the
lectures
differing
only
by
the
accidental
difference
of
diligence
or
ability
in
the
professors
the
students
wear
scarlet
gowns
and
the
professors
black
which
is
i
believe
the
academical
dress
in
all
the
scottish
universities
except
that
of
edinburgh
where
the
scholars
are
not
distinguished
by
any
particular
habit
in
the
king
college
there
is
kept
a
public
table
but
the
scholars
of
the
marischal
college
are
boarded
in
the
town
the
expence
of
living
is
here
according
to
the
information
that
i
could
obtain
somewhat
more
than
at
andrews
the
course
of
education
is
extended
to
four
years
at
the
end
of
which
those
who
take
a
degree
who
are
not
many
become
masters
of
arts
and
whoever
is
a
master
may
if
he
pleases
immediately
commence
doctor
the
title
of
doctor
however
was
for
a
considerable
time
bestowed
only
on
physicians
the
advocates
are
examined
and
approved
by
their
own
body
the
ministers
were
not
ambitious
of
titles
or
were
afraid
of
being
censured
for
ambition
and
the
doctorate
in
every
faculty
was
commonly
given
or
sold
into
other
countries
the
ministers
are
now
reconciled
to
distinction
and
as
it
must
always
happen
that
some
will
excel
others
have
thought
graduation
a
proper
testimony
of
uncommon
abilities
or
acquisitions
the
indiscriminate
collation
of
degrees
has
justly
taken
away
that
respect
which
they
originally
claimed
as
stamps
by
which
the
literary
value
of
men
so
distinguished
was
authoritatively
denoted
that
academical
honours
or
any
others
should
be
conferred
with
exact
proportion
to
merit
is
more
than
human
judgment
or
human
integrity
have
given
reason
to
expect
perhaps
degrees
in
universities
can
not
be
better
adjusted
by
any
general
rule
than
by
the
length
of
time
passed
in
the
public
profession
of
learning
an
english
or
irish
doctorate
can
not
be
obtained
by
a
very
young
man
and
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
what
is
likewise
by
experience
commonly
found
true
that
he
who
is
by
age
qualified
to
be
a
doctor
has
in
so
much
time
gained
learning
sufficient
not
to
disgrace
the
title
or
wit
sufficient
not
to
desire
it
the
scotch
universities
hold
but
one
term
or
session
in
the
year
that
of
andrews
continues
eight
months
that
of
aberdeen
only
five
from
the
first
of
november
to
the
first
of
april
in
aberdeen
there
is
an
english
chapel
in
which
the
congregation
was
numerous
and
splendid
the
form
of
public
worship
used
by
the
church
of
england
is
in
scotland
legally
practised
in
licensed
chapels
served
by
clergymen
of
english
or
irish
ordination
and
by
tacit
connivance
quietly
permitted
in
separate
congregations
supplied
with
ministers
by
the
successors
of
the
bishops
who
were
deprived
at
the
revolution
we
came
to
aberdeen
on
saturday
august
on
monday
we
were
invited
into
the
where
i
had
the
freedom
of
the
city
given
me
by
the
lord
provost
the
honour
conferred
had
all
the
decorations
that
politeness
could
add
and
what
i
am
afraid
i
should
not
have
had
to
say
of
any
city
south
of
the
tweed
i
found
no
petty
officer
bowing
for
a
fee
the
parchment
containing
the
record
of
admission
is
with
the
seal
appending
fastened
to
a
riband
and
worn
for
one
day
by
the
new
citizen
in
his
hat
by
a
lady
who
saw
us
at
the
chapel
the
earl
of
errol
was
informed
of
our
arrival
and
we
had
the
honour
of
an
invitation
to
his
seat
called
slanes
castle
as
i
am
told
improperly
from
the
castle
of
that
name
which
once
stood
at
a
place
not
far
distant
the
road
beyond
aberdeen
grew
more
stony
and
continued
equally
naked
of
all
vegetable
decoration
we
travelled
over
a
tract
of
ground
near
the
sea
which
not
long
ago
suffered
a
very
uncommon
and
unexpected
calamity
the
sand
of
the
shore
was
raised
by
a
tempest
in
such
quantities
and
carried
to
such
a
distance
that
an
estate
was
overwhelmed
and
lost
such
and
so
hopeless
was
the
barrenness
superinduced
that
the
owner
when
he
was
required
to
pay
the
usual
tax
desired
rather
to
resign
the
ground
slanes
castle
the
buller
of
buchan
we
came
in
the
afternoon
to
slanes
castle
built
upon
the
margin
of
the
sea
so
that
the
walls
of
one
of
the
towers
seem
only
a
continuation
of
a
perpendicular
rock
the
foot
of
which
is
beaten
by
the
waves
to
walk
round
the
house
seemed
impracticable
from
the
windows
the
eye
wanders
over
the
sea
that
separates
scotland
from
norway
and
when
the
winds
beat
with
violence
must
enjoy
all
the
terrifick
grandeur
of
the
tempestuous
ocean
i
would
not
for
my
amusement
wish
for
a
storm
but
as
storms
whether
wished
or
not
will
sometimes
happen
i
may
say
without
violation
of
humanity
that
i
should
willingly
look
out
upon
them
from
slanes
castle
when
we
were
about
to
take
our
leave
our
departure
was
prohibited
by
the
countess
till
we
should
have
seen
two
places
upon
the
coast
which
she
rightly
considered
as
worthy
of
curiosity
dun
buy
and
the
buller
of
buchan
to
which
boyd
very
kindly
conducted
us
dun
buy
which
in
erse
is
said
to
signify
the
yellow
rock
is
a
double
protuberance
of
stone
open
to
the
main
sea
on
one
side
and
parted
from
the
land
by
a
very
narrow
channel
on
the
other
it
has
its
name
and
its
colour
from
the
dung
of
innumerable
which
in
the
spring
chuse
this
place
as
convenient
for
incubation
and
have
their
eggs
and
their
young
taken
in
great
abundance
one
of
the
birds
that
frequent
this
rock
has
as
we
were
told
its
body
not
larger
than
a
duck
and
yet
lays
eggs
as
large
as
those
of
a
goose
this
bird
is
by
the
inhabitants
named
a
coot
that
which
is
called
coot
in
england
is
here
a
cooter
upon
these
rocks
there
was
nothing
that
could
long
detain
attention
and
we
soon
turned
our
eyes
to
the
buller
or
bouilloir
of
buchan
which
no
man
can
see
with
indifference
who
has
either
sense
of
danger
or
delight
in
rarity
it
is
a
rock
perpendicularly
tubulated
united
on
one
side
with
a
high
shore
and
on
the
other
rising
steep
to
a
great
height
above
the
main
sea
the
top
is
open
from
which
may
be
seen
a
dark
gulf
of
water
which
flows
into
the
cavity
through
a
breach
made
in
the
lower
part
of
the
inclosing
rock
it
has
the
appearance
of
a
vast
well
bordered
with
a
wall
the
edge
of
the
buller
is
not
wide
and
to
those
that
walk
round
appears
very
narrow
he
that
ventures
to
look
downward
sees
that
if
his
foot
should
slip
he
must
fall
from
his
dreadful
elevation
upon
stones
on
one
side
or
into
water
on
the
other
we
however
went
round
and
were
glad
when
the
circuit
was
completed
when
we
came
down
to
the
sea
we
saw
some
boats
and
rowers
and
resolved
to
explore
the
buller
at
the
bottom
we
entered
the
arch
which
the
water
had
made
and
found
ourselves
in
a
place
which
though
we
could
not
think
ourselves
in
danger
we
could
scarcely
survey
without
some
recoil
of
the
mind
the
bason
in
which
we
floated
was
nearly
circular
perhaps
thirty
yards
in
diameter
we
were
inclosed
by
a
natural
wall
rising
steep
on
every
side
to
a
height
which
produced
the
idea
of
insurmountable
confinement
the
interception
of
all
lateral
light
caused
a
dismal
gloom
round
us
was
a
perpendicular
rock
above
us
the
distant
sky
and
below
an
unknown
profundity
of
water
if
i
had
any
malice
against
a
walking
spirit
instead
of
laying
him
in
the
i
would
condemn
him
to
reside
in
the
buller
of
buchan
but
terrour
without
danger
is
only
one
of
the
sports
of
fancy
a
voluntary
agitation
of
the
mind
that
is
permitted
no
longer
than
it
pleases
we
were
soon
at
leisure
to
examine
the
place
with
minute
inspection
and
found
many
cavities
which
as
the
waterman
told
us
went
backward
to
a
depth
which
they
had
never
explored
their
extent
we
had
not
time
to
try
they
are
said
to
serve
different
purposes
ladies
come
hither
sometimes
in
the
summer
with
collations
and
smugglers
make
them
storehouses
for
clandestine
merchandise
it
is
hardly
to
be
doubted
but
the
pirates
of
ancient
times
often
used
them
as
magazines
of
arms
or
repositories
of
plunder
to
the
little
vessels
used
by
the
northern
rovers
the
buller
may
have
served
as
a
shelter
from
storms
and
perhaps
as
a
retreat
from
enemies
the
entrance
might
have
been
stopped
or
guarded
with
little
difficulty
and
though
the
vessels
that
were
stationed
within
would
have
been
battered
with
stones
showered
on
them
from
above
yet
the
crews
would
have
lain
safe
in
the
caverns
next
morning
we
continued
our
journey
pleased
with
our
reception
at
slanes
castle
of
which
we
had
now
leisure
to
recount
the
grandeur
and
the
elegance
for
our
way
afforded
us
few
topics
of
conversation
the
ground
was
neither
uncultivated
nor
unfruitful
but
it
was
still
all
arable
of
flocks
or
herds
there
was
no
appearance
i
had
now
travelled
two
hundred
miles
in
scotland
and
seen
only
one
tree
not
younger
than
myself
bamff
we
dined
this
day
at
the
house
of
frazer
of
streichton
who
shewed
us
in
his
grounds
some
stones
yet
standing
of
a
druidical
circle
and
what
i
began
to
think
more
worthy
of
notice
some
forest
trees
of
full
growth
at
night
we
came
to
bamff
where
i
remember
nothing
that
particularly
claimed
my
attention
the
ancient
towns
of
scotland
have
generally
an
appearance
unusual
to
englishmen
the
houses
whether
great
or
small
are
for
the
most
part
built
of
stones
their
ends
are
now
and
then
next
the
streets
and
the
entrance
into
them
is
very
often
by
a
flight
of
steps
which
reaches
up
to
the
second
story
the
floor
which
is
level
with
the
ground
being
entered
only
by
stairs
descending
within
the
house
the
art
of
joining
squares
of
glass
with
lead
is
little
used
in
scotland
and
in
some
places
is
totally
forgotten
the
frames
of
their
windows
are
all
of
wood
they
are
more
frugal
of
their
glass
than
the
english
and
will
often
in
houses
not
otherwise
mean
compose
a
square
of
two
pieces
not
joining
like
cracked
glass
but
with
one
edge
laid
perhaps
half
an
inch
over
the
other
their
windows
do
not
move
upon
hinges
but
are
pushed
up
and
drawn
down
in
grooves
yet
they
are
seldom
accommodated
with
weights
and
pullies
he
that
would
have
his
window
open
must
hold
it
with
his
hand
unless
what
may
be
sometimes
found
among
good
contrivers
there
be
a
nail
which
he
may
stick
into
a
hole
to
keep
it
from
falling
what
can
not
be
done
without
some
uncommon
trouble
or
particular
expedient
will
not
often
be
done
at
all
the
incommodiousness
of
the
scotch
windows
keeps
them
very
closely
shut
the
necessity
of
ventilating
human
habitations
has
not
yet
been
found
by
our
northern
neighbours
and
even
in
houses
well
built
and
elegantly
furnished
a
stranger
may
be
sometimes
forgiven
if
he
allows
himself
to
wish
for
fresher
air
these
diminutive
observations
seem
to
take
away
something
from
the
dignity
of
writing
and
therefore
are
never
communicated
but
with
hesitation
and
a
little
fear
of
abasement
and
contempt
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
life
consists
not
of
a
series
of
illustrious
actions
or
elegant
enjoyments
the
greater
part
of
our
time
passes
in
compliance
with
necessities
in
the
performance
of
daily
duties
in
the
removal
of
small
inconveniences
in
the
procurement
of
petty
pleasures
and
we
are
well
or
ill
at
ease
as
the
main
stream
of
life
glides
on
smoothly
or
is
ruffled
by
small
obstacles
and
frequent
interruption
the
true
state
of
every
nation
is
the
state
of
common
life
the
manners
of
a
people
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
schools
of
learning
or
the
palaces
of
greatness
where
the
national
character
is
obscured
or
obliterated
by
travel
or
instruction
by
philosophy
or
vanity
nor
is
public
happiness
to
be
estimated
by
the
assemblies
of
the
gay
or
the
banquets
of
the
rich
the
great
mass
of
nations
is
neither
rich
nor
gay
they
whose
aggregate
constitutes
the
people
are
found
in
the
streets
and
the
villages
in
the
shops
and
farms
and
from
them
collectively
considered
must
the
measure
of
general
prosperity
be
taken
as
they
approach
to
delicacy
a
nation
is
refined
as
their
conveniences
are
multiplied
a
nation
at
least
a
commercial
nation
must
be
denominated
wealthy
elgin
finding
nothing
to
detain
us
at
bamff
we
set
out
in
the
morning
and
having
breakfasted
at
cullen
about
noon
came
to
elgin
where
in
the
inn
that
we
supposed
the
best
a
dinner
was
set
before
us
which
we
could
not
eat
this
was
the
first
time
and
except
one
the
last
that
i
found
any
reason
to
complain
of
a
scotish
table
and
such
disappointments
i
suppose
must
be
expected
in
every
country
where
there
is
no
great
frequency
of
travellers
the
ruins
of
the
cathedral
of
elgin
afforded
us
another
proof
of
the
waste
of
reformation
there
is
enough
yet
remaining
to
shew
that
it
was
once
magnificent
its
whole
plot
is
easily
traced
on
the
north
side
of
the
choir
the
which
is
roofed
with
an
arch
of
stone
remains
entire
and
on
the
south
side
another
mass
of
building
which
we
could
not
enter
is
preserved
by
the
care
of
the
family
of
gordon
but
the
body
of
the
church
is
a
mass
of
fragments
a
paper
was
here
put
into
our
hands
which
deduced
from
sufficient
authorities
the
history
of
this
venerable
ruin
the
church
of
elgin
had
in
the
intestine
tumults
of
the
barbarous
ages
been
laid
waste
by
the
irruption
of
a
highland
chief
whom
the
bishop
had
offended
but
it
was
gradually
restored
to
the
state
of
which
the
traces
may
be
now
discerned
and
was
at
last
not
destroyed
by
the
tumultuous
violence
of
knox
but
more
shamefully
suffered
to
dilapidate
by
deliberate
robbery
and
frigid
indifference
there
is
still
extant
in
the
books
of
the
council
an
order
of
which
i
can
not
remember
the
date
but
which
was
doubtless
issued
after
the
reformation
directing
that
the
lead
which
covers
the
two
cathedrals
of
elgin
and
aberdeen
shall
be
taken
away
and
converted
into
money
for
the
support
of
the
army
a
scotch
army
was
in
those
times
very
cheaply
kept
yet
the
lead
of
two
churches
must
have
born
so
small
a
proportion
to
any
military
expence
that
it
is
hard
not
to
believe
the
reason
alleged
to
be
merely
popular
and
the
money
intended
for
some
private
purse
the
order
however
was
obeyed
the
two
churches
were
stripped
and
the
lead
was
shipped
to
be
sold
in
holland
i
hope
every
reader
will
rejoice
that
this
cargo
of
sacrilege
was
lost
at
sea
let
us
not
however
make
too
much
haste
to
despise
our
neighbours
our
own
cathedrals
are
mouldering
by
unregarded
dilapidation
it
seems
to
be
part
of
the
despicable
philosophy
of
the
time
to
despise
monuments
of
sacred
magnificence
and
we
are
in
danger
of
doing
that
deliberately
which
the
scots
did
not
do
but
in
the
unsettled
state
of
an
imperfect
constitution
those
who
had
once
uncovered
the
cathedrals
never
wished
to
cover
them
again
and
being
thus
made
useless
they
were
first
neglected
and
perhaps
as
the
stone
was
wanted
afterwards
demolished
elgin
seems
a
place
of
little
trade
and
thinly
inhabited
the
episcopal
cities
of
scotland
i
believe
generally
fell
with
their
churches
though
some
of
them
have
since
recovered
by
a
situation
convenient
for
commerce
thus
glasgow
though
it
has
no
longer
an
archbishop
has
risen
beyond
its
original
state
by
the
opulence
of
its
traders
and
aberdeen
though
its
ancient
stock
had
decayed
flourishes
by
a
new
shoot
in
another
place
in
the
chief
street
of
elgin
the
houses
jut
over
the
lowest
story
like
the
old
buildings
of
timber
in
london
but
with
greater
prominence
so
that
there
is
sometimes
a
walk
for
a
considerable
length
under
a
cloister
or
portico
which
is
now
indeed
frequently
broken
because
the
new
houses
have
another
form
but
seems
to
have
been
uniformly
continued
in
the
old
city
fores
calder
fort
george
we
went
forwards
the
same
day
to
fores
the
town
to
which
macbeth
was
travelling
when
he
met
the
weird
sisters
in
his
way
this
to
an
englishman
is
classic
ground
our
imaginations
were
heated
and
our
thoughts
recalled
to
their
old
amusements
we
had
now
a
prelude
to
the
highlands
we
began
to
leave
fertility
and
culture
behind
us
and
saw
for
a
great
length
of
road
nothing
but
heath
yet
at
fochabars
a
seat
belonging
to
the
duke
of
gordon
there
is
an
orchard
which
in
scotland
i
had
never
seen
before
with
some
timber
trees
and
a
plantation
of
oaks
at
fores
we
found
good
accommodation
but
nothing
worthy
of
particular
remark
and
next
morning
entered
upon
the
road
on
which
macbeth
heard
the
fatal
prediction
but
we
travelled
on
not
interrupted
by
promises
of
kingdoms
and
came
to
nairn
a
royal
burgh
which
if
once
it
flourished
is
now
in
a
state
of
miserable
decay
but
i
know
not
whether
its
chief
annual
magistrate
has
not
still
the
title
of
lord
provost
at
nairn
we
may
fix
the
verge
of
the
highlands
for
here
i
first
saw
peat
fires
and
first
heard
the
erse
language
we
had
no
motive
to
stay
longer
than
to
breakfast
and
went
forward
to
the
house
of
macaulay
the
minister
who
published
an
account
of
kilda
and
by
his
direction
visited
calder
castle
from
which
macbeth
drew
his
second
title
it
has
been
formerly
a
place
of
strength
the
drawbridge
is
still
to
be
seen
but
the
moat
is
now
dry
the
tower
is
very
ancient
its
walls
are
of
great
thickness
arched
on
the
top
with
stone
and
surrounded
with
battlements
the
rest
of
the
house
is
later
though
far
from
modern
we
were
favoured
by
a
gentleman
who
lives
in
the
castle
with
a
letter
to
one
of
the
officers
at
fort
george
which
being
the
most
regular
fortification
in
the
island
well
deserves
the
notice
of
a
traveller
who
has
never
travelled
before
we
went
thither
next
day
found
a
very
kind
reception
were
led
round
the
works
by
a
gentleman
who
explained
the
use
of
every
part
and
entertained
by
sir
eyre
coote
the
governour
with
such
elegance
of
conversation
as
left
us
no
attention
to
the
delicacies
of
his
table
of
fort
george
i
shall
not
attempt
to
give
any
account
i
can
not
delineate
it
scientifically
and
a
loose
and
popular
description
is
of
use
only
when
the
imagination
is
to
be
amused
there
was
every
where
an
appearance
of
the
utmost
neatness
and
regularity
but
my
suffrage
is
of
little
value
because
this
and
fort
augustus
are
the
only
garrisons
that
i
ever
saw
we
did
not
regret
the
time
spent
at
the
fort
though
in
consequence
of
our
delay
we
came
somewhat
late
to
inverness
the
town
which
may
properly
be
called
the
capital
of
the
highlands
hither
the
inhabitants
of
the
inland
parts
come
to
be
supplied
with
what
they
can
not
make
for
themselves
hither
the
young
nymphs
of
the
mountains
and
valleys
are
sent
for
education
and
as
far
as
my
observation
has
reached
are
not
sent
in
vain
inverness
inverness
was
the
last
place
which
had
a
regular
communication
by
high
roads
with
the
southern
counties
all
the
ways
beyond
it
have
i
believe
been
made
by
the
soldiers
in
this
century
at
inverness
therefore
cromwell
when
he
subdued
scotland
stationed
a
garrison
as
at
the
boundary
of
the
highlands
the
soldiers
seem
to
have
incorporated
afterwards
with
the
inhabitants
and
to
have
peopled
the
place
with
an
english
race
for
the
language
of
this
town
has
been
long
considered
as
peculiarly
elegant
here
is
a
castle
called
the
castle
of
macbeth
the
walls
of
which
are
yet
standing
it
was
no
very
capacious
edifice
but
stands
upon
a
rock
so
high
and
steep
that
i
think
it
was
once
not
accessible
but
by
the
help
of
ladders
or
a
bridge
over
against
it
on
another
hill
was
a
fort
built
by
cromwell
now
totally
demolished
for
no
faction
of
scotland
loved
the
name
of
cromwell
or
had
any
desire
to
continue
his
memory
yet
what
the
romans
did
to
other
nations
was
in
a
great
degree
done
by
cromwell
to
the
scots
he
civilized
them
by
conquest
and
introduced
by
useful
violence
the
arts
of
peace
i
was
told
at
aberdeen
that
the
people
learned
from
cromwell
soldiers
to
make
shoes
and
to
plant
kail
how
they
lived
without
kail
it
is
not
easy
to
guess
they
cultivate
hardly
any
other
plant
for
common
tables
and
when
they
had
not
kail
they
probably
had
nothing
the
numbers
that
go
barefoot
are
still
sufficient
to
shew
that
shoes
may
be
spared
they
are
not
yet
considered
as
necessaries
of
life
for
tall
boys
not
otherwise
meanly
dressed
run
without
them
in
the
streets
and
in
the
islands
the
sons
of
gentlemen
pass
several
of
their
first
years
with
naked
feet
i
know
not
whether
it
be
not
peculiar
to
the
scots
to
have
attained
the
liberal
without
the
manual
arts
to
have
excelled
in
ornamental
knowledge
and
to
have
wanted
not
only
the
elegancies
but
the
conveniences
of
common
life
literature
soon
after
its
revival
found
its
way
to
scotland
and
from
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
almost
to
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
the
politer
studies
were
very
diligently
pursued
the
latin
poetry
of
poetarum
would
have
done
honour
to
any
nation
at
least
till
the
publication
of
the
english
had
very
little
to
oppose
yet
men
thus
ingenious
and
inquisitive
were
content
to
live
in
total
ignorance
of
the
trades
by
which
human
wants
are
supplied
and
to
supply
them
by
the
grossest
means
till
the
union
made
them
acquainted
with
english
manners
the
culture
of
their
lands
was
unskilful
and
their
domestick
life
unformed
their
tables
were
coarse
as
the
feasts
of
eskimeaux
and
their
houses
filthy
as
the
cottages
of
hottentots
since
they
have
known
that
their
condition
was
capable
of
improvement
their
progress
in
useful
knowledge
has
been
rapid
and
uniform
what
remains
to
be
done
they
will
quickly
do
and
then
wonder
like
me
why
that
which
was
so
necessary
and
so
easy
was
so
long
delayed
but
they
must
be
for
ever
content
to
owe
to
the
english
that
elegance
and
culture
which
if
they
had
been
vigilant
and
active
perhaps
the
english
might
have
owed
to
them
here
the
appearance
of
life
began
to
alter
i
had
seen
a
few
women
with
plaids
at
aberdeen
but
at
inverness
the
highland
manners
are
common
there
is
i
think
a
kirk
in
which
only
the
erse
language
is
used
there
is
likewise
an
english
chapel
but
meanly
built
where
on
sunday
we
saw
a
very
decent
congregation
we
were
now
to
bid
farewel
to
the
luxury
of
travelling
and
to
enter
a
country
upon
which
perhaps
no
wheel
has
ever
rolled
we
could
indeed
have
used
our
one
day
longer
along
the
military
road
to
fort
augustus
but
we
could
have
hired
no
horses
beyond
inverness
and
we
were
not
so
sparing
of
ourselves
as
to
lead
them
merely
that
we
might
have
one
day
longer
the
indulgence
of
a
carriage
at
inverness
therefore
we
procured
three
horses
for
ourselves
and
a
servant
and
one
more
for
our
baggage
which
was
no
very
heavy
load
we
found
in
the
course
of
our
journey
the
convenience
of
having
disencumbered
ourselves
by
laying
aside
whatever
we
could
spare
for
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
without
experience
how
in
climbing
crags
and
treading
bogs
and
winding
through
narrow
and
obstructed
passages
a
little
bulk
will
hinder
and
a
little
weight
will
burthen
or
how
often
a
man
that
has
pleased
himself
at
home
with
his
own
resolution
will
in
the
hour
of
darkness
and
fatigue
be
content
to
leave
behind
him
every
thing
but
himself
lough
ness
we
took
two
highlanders
to
run
beside
us
partly
to
shew
us
the
way
and
partly
to
take
back
from
the
the
horses
of
which
they
were
the
owners
one
of
them
was
a
man
of
great
liveliness
and
activity
of
whom
his
companion
said
that
he
would
tire
any
horse
in
inverness
both
of
them
were
civil
and
civility
seems
part
of
the
national
character
of
highlanders
every
chieftain
is
a
monarch
and
politeness
the
natural
product
of
royal
government
is
diffused
from
the
laird
through
the
whole
clan
but
they
are
not
commonly
dexterous
their
narrowness
of
life
confines
them
to
a
few
operations
and
they
are
accustomed
to
endure
little
wants
more
than
to
remove
them
we
mounted
our
steeds
on
the
thirtieth
of
august
and
directed
our
guides
to
conduct
us
to
fort
augustus
it
is
built
at
the
head
of
lough
ness
of
which
inverness
stands
at
the
outlet
the
way
between
them
has
been
cut
by
the
soldiers
and
the
greater
part
of
it
runs
along
a
rock
levelled
with
great
labour
and
exactness
near
the
most
of
this
day
journey
was
very
pleasant
the
day
though
bright
was
not
hot
and
the
appearance
of
the
country
if
i
had
not
seen
the
peak
would
have
been
wholly
new
we
went
upon
a
surface
so
hard
and
level
that
we
had
little
care
to
hold
the
bridle
and
were
therefore
at
full
leisure
for
contemplation
on
the
left
were
high
and
steep
rocks
shaded
with
birch
the
hardy
native
of
the
north
and
covered
with
fern
or
heath
on
the
right
the
limpid
waters
of
lough
ness
were
beating
their
bank
and
waving
their
surface
by
a
gentle
agitation
beyond
them
were
rocks
sometimes
covered
with
verdure
and
sometimes
towering
in
horrid
nakedness
now
and
then
we
espied
a
little
cornfield
which
served
to
impress
more
strongly
the
general
barrenness
lough
ness
is
about
miles
long
and
from
one
mile
to
two
miles
broad
it
is
remarkable
that
boethius
in
his
description
of
scotland
gives
it
twelve
miles
of
breadth
when
historians
or
geographers
exhibit
false
accounts
of
places
far
distant
they
may
be
forgiven
because
they
can
tell
but
what
they
are
told
and
that
their
accounts
exceed
the
truth
may
be
justly
supposed
because
most
men
exaggerate
to
others
if
not
to
themselves
but
boethius
lived
at
no
great
distance
if
he
never
saw
the
lake
he
must
have
been
very
incurious
and
if
he
had
seen
it
his
veracity
yielded
to
very
slight
temptations
lough
ness
though
not
twelve
miles
broad
is
a
very
remarkable
diffusion
of
water
without
islands
it
fills
a
large
hollow
between
two
ridges
of
high
rocks
being
supplied
partly
by
the
torrents
which
fall
into
it
on
either
side
and
partly
as
is
supposed
by
springs
at
the
bottom
its
water
is
remarkably
clear
and
pleasant
and
is
imagined
by
the
natives
to
be
medicinal
we
were
told
that
it
is
in
some
places
a
hundred
and
forty
fathoms
deep
a
profundity
scarcely
credible
and
which
probably
those
that
relate
it
have
never
sounded
its
fish
are
salmon
trout
and
pike
it
was
said
at
fort
augustus
that
lough
ness
is
open
in
the
hardest
winters
though
a
lake
not
far
from
it
is
covered
with
ice
in
discussing
these
exceptions
from
the
course
of
nature
the
first
question
is
whether
the
fact
be
justly
stated
that
which
is
strange
is
delightful
and
a
pleasing
error
is
not
willingly
detected
accuracy
of
narration
is
not
very
common
and
there
are
few
so
rigidly
philosophical
as
not
to
represent
as
perpetual
what
is
only
frequent
or
as
constant
what
is
really
casual
if
it
be
true
that
lough
ness
never
freezes
it
is
either
sheltered
by
its
high
banks
from
the
cold
blasts
and
exposed
only
to
those
winds
which
have
more
power
to
agitate
than
congeal
or
it
is
kept
in
perpetual
motion
by
the
rush
of
streams
from
the
rocks
that
inclose
it
its
profundity
though
it
should
be
such
as
is
represented
can
have
little
part
in
this
exemption
for
though
deep
wells
are
not
frozen
because
their
water
is
secluded
from
the
external
air
yet
where
a
wide
surface
is
exposed
to
the
full
influence
of
a
freezing
atmosphere
i
know
not
why
the
depth
should
keep
it
open
natural
philosophy
is
now
one
of
the
favourite
studies
of
the
scottish
nation
and
lough
ness
well
deserves
to
be
diligently
examined
the
road
on
which
we
travelled
and
which
was
itself
a
source
of
entertainment
is
made
along
the
rock
in
the
direction
of
the
lough
sometimes
by
breaking
off
protuberances
and
sometimes
by
cutting
the
great
mass
of
stone
to
a
considerable
depth
the
fragments
are
piled
in
a
loose
wall
on
either
side
with
apertures
left
at
very
short
spaces
to
give
a
passage
to
the
wintry
currents
part
of
it
is
bordered
with
low
trees
from
which
our
guides
gathered
nuts
and
would
have
had
the
appearance
of
an
english
lane
except
that
an
english
lane
is
almost
always
dirty
it
has
been
made
with
great
labour
but
has
this
advantage
that
it
can
not
without
equal
labour
be
broken
up
within
our
sight
there
were
goats
feeding
or
playing
the
mountains
have
red
deer
but
they
came
not
within
view
and
if
what
is
said
of
their
vigilance
and
subtlety
be
true
they
have
some
claim
to
that
palm
of
wisdom
which
the
eastern
philosopher
whom
alexander
interrogated
gave
to
those
beasts
which
live
furthest
from
men
near
the
way
by
the
water
side
we
espied
a
cottage
this
was
the
first
highland
hut
that
i
had
seen
and
as
our
business
was
with
life
and
manners
we
were
willing
to
visit
it
to
enter
a
habitation
without
leave
seems
to
be
not
considered
here
as
rudeness
or
intrusion
the
old
laws
of
hospitality
still
give
this
licence
to
a
stranger
a
hut
is
constructed
with
loose
stones
ranged
for
the
most
part
with
some
tendency
to
circularity
it
must
be
placed
where
the
wind
can
not
act
upon
it
with
violence
because
it
has
no
cement
and
where
the
water
will
run
easily
away
because
it
has
no
floor
but
the
naked
ground
the
wall
which
is
commonly
about
six
feet
high
declines
from
the
perpendicular
a
little
inward
such
rafters
as
can
be
procured
are
then
raised
for
a
roof
and
covered
with
heath
which
makes
a
strong
and
warm
thatch
kept
from
flying
off
by
ropes
of
twisted
heath
of
which
the
ends
reaching
from
the
center
of
the
thatch
to
the
top
of
the
wall
are
held
firm
by
the
weight
of
a
large
stone
no
light
is
admitted
but
at
the
entrance
and
through
a
hole
in
the
thatch
which
gives
vent
to
the
smoke
this
hole
is
not
directly
over
the
fire
lest
the
rain
should
extinguish
it
and
the
smoke
therefore
naturally
fills
the
place
before
it
escapes
such
is
the
general
structure
of
the
houses
in
which
one
of
the
nations
of
this
opulent
and
powerful
island
has
been
hitherto
content
to
live
huts
however
are
not
more
uniform
than
palaces
and
this
which
we
were
inspecting
was
very
far
from
one
of
the
meanest
for
it
was
divided
into
several
apartments
and
its
inhabitants
possessed
such
property
as
a
pastoral
poet
might
exalt
into
riches
when
we
entered
we
found
an
old
woman
boiling
in
a
kettle
she
spoke
little
english
but
we
had
interpreters
at
hand
and
she
was
willing
enough
to
display
her
whole
system
of
economy
she
has
five
children
of
which
none
are
yet
gone
from
her
the
eldest
a
boy
of
thirteen
and
her
husband
who
is
eighty
years
old
were
at
work
in
the
wood
her
two
next
sons
were
gone
to
inverness
to
buy
meal
by
which
oatmeal
is
always
meant
meal
she
considered
as
expensive
food
and
told
us
that
in
spring
when
the
goats
gave
milk
the
children
could
live
without
it
she
is
mistress
of
sixty
goats
and
i
saw
many
kids
in
an
enclosure
at
the
end
of
her
house
she
had
also
some
poultry
by
the
lake
we
saw
a
and
a
small
spot
of
ground
on
which
stood
four
shucks
containing
each
twelve
sheaves
of
barley
she
has
all
this
from
the
labour
of
their
own
hands
and
for
what
is
necessary
to
be
bought
her
kids
and
her
chickens
are
sent
to
market
with
the
true
pastoral
hospitality
she
asked
us
to
sit
down
and
drink
whisky
she
is
religious
and
though
the
kirk
is
four
miles
off
probably
eight
english
miles
she
goes
thither
every
sunday
we
gave
her
a
shilling
and
she
begged
snuff
for
snuff
is
the
luxury
of
a
highland
cottage
soon
afterwards
we
came
to
the
general
hut
so
called
because
it
was
the
temporary
abode
of
wade
while
he
superintended
the
works
upon
the
road
it
is
now
a
house
of
entertainment
for
passengers
and
we
found
it
not
ill
stocked
with
provisions
fall
of
fiers
towards
evening
we
crossed
by
a
bridge
the
river
which
makes
the
celebrated
fall
of
fiers
the
country
at
the
bridge
strikes
the
imagination
with
all
the
gloom
and
grandeur
of
siberian
solitude
the
way
makes
a
flexure
and
the
mountains
covered
with
trees
rise
at
once
on
the
left
hand
and
in
the
front
we
desired
our
guides
to
shew
us
the
fall
and
dismounting
clambered
over
very
rugged
crags
till
i
began
to
wish
that
our
curiosity
might
have
been
gratified
with
less
trouble
and
danger
we
came
at
last
to
a
place
where
we
could
overlook
the
river
and
saw
a
channel
torn
as
it
seems
through
black
piles
of
stone
by
which
the
stream
is
obstructed
and
broken
till
it
comes
to
a
very
steep
descent
of
such
dreadful
depth
that
we
were
naturally
inclined
to
turn
aside
our
eyes
but
we
visited
the
place
at
an
unseasonable
time
and
found
it
divested
of
its
dignity
and
terror
nature
never
gives
every
thing
at
once
a
long
continuance
of
dry
weather
which
made
the
rest
of
the
way
easy
and
delightful
deprived
us
of
the
pleasure
expected
from
the
fall
of
fiers
the
river
having
now
no
water
but
what
the
springs
supply
showed
us
only
a
swift
current
clear
and
shallow
fretting
over
the
asperities
of
the
rocky
bottom
and
we
were
left
to
exercise
our
thoughts
by
endeavouring
to
conceive
the
effect
of
a
thousand
streams
poured
from
the
mountains
into
one
channel
struggling
for
expansion
in
a
narrow
passage
exasperated
by
rocks
rising
in
their
way
and
at
last
discharging
all
their
violence
of
waters
by
a
sudden
fall
through
the
horrid
chasm
the
way
now
grew
less
easy
descending
by
an
uneven
declivity
but
without
either
dirt
or
danger
we
did
not
arrive
at
fort
augustus
till
it
was
late
boswell
who
between
his
father
merit
and
his
own
is
sure
of
reception
wherever
he
comes
sent
a
servant
before
to
beg
admission
and
entertainment
for
that
night
trapaud
the
governor
treated
us
with
that
courtesy
which
is
so
closely
connected
with
the
military
character
he
came
out
to
meet
us
beyond
the
gates
and
apologized
that
at
so
late
an
hour
the
rules
of
a
garrison
suffered
him
to
give
us
entrance
only
at
the
postern
fort
augustus
in
the
morning
we
viewed
the
fort
which
is
much
less
than
that
of
george
and
is
said
to
be
commanded
by
the
neighbouring
hills
it
was
not
long
ago
taken
by
the
highlanders
but
its
situation
seems
well
chosen
for
pleasure
if
not
for
strength
it
stands
at
the
head
of
the
lake
and
by
a
sloop
of
sixty
tuns
is
supplied
from
inverness
with
great
convenience
we
were
now
to
cross
the
highlands
towards
the
western
coast
and
to
content
ourselves
with
such
accommodations
as
a
way
so
little
frequented
could
afford
the
journey
was
not
formidable
for
it
was
but
of
two
days
very
unequally
divided
because
the
only
house
where
we
could
be
entertained
was
not
further
off
than
a
third
of
the
way
we
soon
came
to
a
high
hill
which
we
mounted
by
a
military
road
cut
in
traverses
so
that
as
we
went
upon
a
higher
stage
we
saw
the
baggage
following
us
below
in
a
contrary
direction
to
make
this
way
the
rock
has
been
hewn
to
a
level
with
labour
that
might
have
broken
the
perseverance
of
a
roman
legion
the
country
is
totally
denuded
of
its
wood
but
the
stumps
both
of
oaks
and
firs
which
are
still
found
shew
that
it
has
been
once
a
forest
of
large
timber
i
do
not
remember
that
we
saw
any
animals
but
we
were
told
that
in
the
mountains
there
are
stags
roebucks
goats
and
rabbits
we
did
not
perceive
that
this
tract
was
possessed
by
human
beings
except
that
once
we
saw
a
corn
field
in
which
a
lady
was
walking
with
some
gentlemen
their
house
was
certainly
at
no
great
distance
but
so
situated
that
we
could
not
descry
it
passing
on
through
the
dreariness
of
solitude
we
found
a
party
of
soldiers
from
the
fort
working
on
the
road
under
the
superintendence
of
a
serjeant
we
told
them
how
kindly
we
had
been
treated
at
the
garrison
and
as
we
were
enjoying
the
benefit
of
their
labours
begged
leave
to
shew
our
gratitude
by
a
small
present
anoch
early
in
the
afternoon
we
came
to
anoch
a
village
in
glenmollison
of
three
huts
one
of
which
is
distinguished
by
a
chimney
here
we
were
to
dine
and
lodge
and
were
conducted
through
the
first
room
that
had
the
chimney
into
another
lighted
by
a
small
glass
window
the
landlord
attended
us
with
great
civility
and
told
us
what
he
could
give
us
to
eat
and
drink
i
found
some
books
on
a
shelf
among
which
were
a
volume
or
more
of
prideaux
connection
this
i
mentioned
as
something
unexpected
and
perceived
that
i
did
not
please
him
i
praised
the
propriety
of
his
language
and
was
answered
that
i
need
not
wonder
for
he
had
learned
it
by
grammar
by
subsequent
opportunities
of
observation
i
found
that
my
diction
had
nothing
peculiar
those
highlanders
that
can
speak
english
commonly
speak
it
well
with
few
of
the
words
and
little
of
the
tone
by
which
a
scotchman
is
distinguished
their
language
seems
to
have
been
learned
in
the
army
or
the
navy
or
by
some
communication
with
those
who
could
give
them
good
examples
of
accent
and
pronunciation
by
their
lowland
neighbours
they
would
not
willingly
be
taught
for
they
have
long
considered
them
as
a
mean
and
degenerate
race
these
prejudices
are
wearing
fast
away
but
so
much
of
them
still
remains
that
when
i
asked
a
very
learned
minister
in
the
islands
which
they
considered
as
their
most
savage
clans
said
he
live
next
the
lowlands
as
we
came
hither
early
in
the
day
we
had
time
sufficient
to
survey
the
place
the
house
was
built
like
other
huts
of
loose
stones
but
the
part
in
which
we
dined
and
slept
was
lined
with
turf
and
wattled
with
twigs
which
kept
the
earth
from
falling
near
it
was
a
garden
of
turnips
and
a
field
of
potatoes
it
stands
in
a
glen
or
valley
pleasantly
watered
by
a
winding
river
but
this
country
however
it
may
delight
the
gazer
or
amuse
the
naturalist
is
of
no
great
advantage
to
its
owners
our
landlord
told
us
of
a
gentleman
who
possesses
lands
eighteen
scotch
miles
in
length
and
three
in
breadth
a
space
containing
at
least
a
hundred
square
english
miles
he
has
raised
his
rents
to
the
danger
of
depopulating
his
farms
and
he
fells
his
timber
and
by
exerting
every
art
of
augmentation
has
obtained
an
yearly
revenue
of
four
hundred
pounds
which
for
a
hundred
square
miles
is
three
halfpence
an
acre
some
time
after
dinner
we
were
surprised
by
the
entrance
of
a
young
woman
not
inelegant
either
in
mien
or
dress
who
asked
us
whether
we
would
have
tea
we
found
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
our
host
and
desired
her
to
make
it
her
conversation
like
her
appearance
was
gentle
and
pleasing
we
knew
that
the
girls
of
the
highlands
are
all
gentlewomen
and
treated
her
with
great
respect
which
she
received
as
customary
and
due
and
was
neither
elated
by
it
nor
confused
but
repaid
my
civilities
without
embarassment
and
told
me
how
much
i
honoured
her
country
by
coming
to
survey
it
she
had
been
at
inverness
to
gain
the
common
female
qualifications
and
had
like
her
father
the
english
pronunciation
i
presented
her
with
a
book
which
i
happened
to
have
about
me
and
should
not
be
pleased
to
think
that
she
forgets
me
in
the
evening
the
soldiers
whom
we
had
passed
on
the
road
came
to
spend
at
our
inn
the
little
money
that
we
had
given
them
they
had
the
true
military
impatience
of
coin
in
their
pockets
and
had
marched
at
least
six
miles
to
find
the
first
place
where
liquor
could
be
bought
having
never
been
before
in
a
place
so
wild
and
unfrequented
i
was
glad
of
their
arrival
because
i
knew
that
we
had
made
them
friends
and
to
gain
still
more
of
their
good
will
we
went
to
them
where
they
were
carousing
in
the
barn
and
added
something
to
our
former
gift
all
that
we
gave
was
not
much
but
it
detained
them
in
the
barn
either
merry
or
quarrelling
the
whole
night
and
in
the
morning
they
went
back
to
their
work
with
great
indignation
at
the
bad
qualities
of
whisky
we
had
gained
so
much
the
favour
of
our
host
that
when
we
left
his
house
in
the
morning
he
walked
by
us
a
great
way
and
entertained
us
with
conversation
both
on
his
own
condition
and
that
of
the
country
his
life
seemed
to
be
merely
pastoral
except
that
he
differed
from
some
of
the
ancient
nomades
in
having
a
settled
dwelling
his
wealth
consists
of
one
hundred
sheep
as
many
goats
twelve
and
beeves
ready
for
the
drover
from
him
we
first
heard
of
the
general
dissatisfaction
which
is
now
driving
the
highlanders
into
the
other
hemisphere
and
when
i
asked
him
whether
they
would
stay
at
home
if
they
were
well
treated
he
answered
with
indignation
that
no
man
willingly
left
his
native
country
of
the
farm
which
he
himself
occupied
the
rent
had
in
years
been
advanced
from
five
to
twenty
pounds
which
he
found
himself
so
little
able
to
pay
that
he
would
be
glad
to
try
his
fortune
in
some
other
place
yet
he
owned
the
reasonableness
of
raising
the
highland
rents
in
a
certain
degree
and
declared
himself
willing
to
pay
ten
pounds
for
the
ground
which
he
had
formerly
had
for
five
our
host
having
amused
us
for
a
time
resigned
us
to
our
guides
the
journey
of
this
day
was
long
not
that
the
distance
was
great
but
that
the
way
was
difficult
we
were
now
in
the
bosom
of
the
highlands
with
full
leisure
to
contemplate
the
appearance
and
properties
of
mountainous
regions
such
as
have
been
in
many
countries
the
last
shelters
of
national
distress
and
are
every
where
the
scenes
of
adventures
stratagems
surprises
and
escapes
mountainous
countries
are
not
passed
but
with
difficulty
not
merely
from
the
labour
of
climbing
for
to
climb
is
not
always
necessary
but
because
that
which
is
not
mountain
is
commonly
bog
through
which
the
way
must
be
picked
with
caution
where
there
are
hills
there
is
much
rain
and
the
torrents
pouring
down
into
the
intermediate
spaces
seldom
find
so
ready
an
outlet
as
not
to
stagnate
till
they
have
broken
the
texture
of
the
ground
of
the
hills
which
our
journey
offered
to
the
view
on
either
side
we
did
not
take
the
height
nor
did
we
see
any
that
astonished
us
with
their
loftiness
towards
the
summit
of
one
there
was
a
white
spot
which
i
should
have
called
a
naked
rock
but
the
guides
who
had
better
eyes
and
were
acquainted
with
the
phenomena
of
the
country
declared
it
to
be
snow
it
had
already
lasted
to
the
end
of
august
and
was
likely
to
maintain
its
contest
with
the
sun
till
it
should
be
reinforced
by
winter
the
height
of
mountains
philosophically
considered
is
properly
computed
from
the
surface
of
the
next
sea
but
as
it
affects
the
eye
or
imagination
of
the
passenger
as
it
makes
either
a
spectacle
or
an
obstruction
it
must
be
reckoned
from
the
place
where
the
rise
begins
to
make
a
considerable
angle
with
the
plain
in
extensive
continents
the
land
may
by
gradual
elevation
attain
great
height
without
any
other
appearance
than
that
of
a
plane
gently
inclined
and
if
a
hill
placed
upon
such
raised
ground
be
described
as
having
its
altitude
equal
to
the
whole
space
above
the
sea
the
representation
will
be
fallacious
these
mountains
may
be
properly
enough
measured
from
the
inland
base
for
it
is
not
much
above
the
sea
as
we
advanced
at
evening
towards
the
western
coast
i
did
not
observe
the
declivity
to
be
greater
than
is
necessary
for
the
discharge
of
the
inland
waters
we
passed
many
rivers
and
rivulets
which
commonly
ran
with
a
clear
shallow
stream
over
a
hard
pebbly
bottom
these
channels
which
seem
so
much
wider
than
the
water
that
they
convey
would
naturally
require
are
formed
by
the
violence
of
wintry
floods
produced
by
the
accumulation
of
innumerable
streams
that
fall
in
rainy
weather
from
the
hills
and
bursting
away
with
resistless
impetuosity
make
themselves
a
passage
proportionate
to
their
mass
such
capricious
and
temporary
waters
can
not
be
expected
to
produce
many
fish
the
rapidity
of
the
wintry
deluge
sweeps
them
away
and
the
scantiness
of
the
summer
stream
would
hardly
sustain
them
above
the
ground
this
is
the
reason
why
in
fording
the
northern
rivers
no
fishes
are
seen
as
in
england
wandering
in
the
water
of
the
hills
many
may
be
called
with
homer
ida
in
springs
but
few
can
deserve
the
epithet
which
he
bestows
upon
pelion
by
their
leaves
they
exhibit
very
little
variety
being
almost
wholly
covered
with
dark
heath
and
even
that
seems
to
be
checked
in
its
growth
what
is
not
heath
is
nakedness
a
little
diversified
by
now
and
then
a
stream
rushing
down
the
steep
an
eye
accustomed
to
flowery
pastures
and
waving
harvests
is
astonished
and
repelled
by
this
wide
extent
of
hopeless
sterility
the
appearance
is
that
of
matter
incapable
of
form
or
usefulness
dismissed
by
nature
from
her
care
and
disinherited
of
her
favours
left
in
its
original
elemental
state
or
quickened
only
with
one
sullen
power
of
useless
vegetation
it
will
very
readily
occur
that
this
uniformity
of
barrenness
can
afford
very
little
amusement
to
the
traveller
that
it
is
easy
to
sit
at
home
and
conceive
rocks
and
heath
and
waterfalls
and
that
these
journeys
are
useless
labours
which
neither
impregnate
the
imagination
nor
enlarge
the
understanding
it
is
true
that
of
far
the
greater
part
of
things
we
must
content
ourselves
with
such
knowledge
as
description
may
exhibit
or
analogy
supply
but
it
is
true
likewise
that
these
ideas
are
always
incomplete
and
that
at
least
till
we
have
compared
them
with
realities
we
do
not
know
them
to
be
just
as
we
see
more
we
become
possessed
of
more
certainties
and
consequently
gain
more
principles
of
reasoning
and
found
a
wider
basis
of
analogy
regions
mountainous
and
wild
thinly
inhabited
and
little
cultivated
make
a
great
part
of
the
earth
and
he
that
has
never
seen
them
must
live
unacquainted
with
much
of
the
face
of
nature
and
with
one
of
the
great
scenes
of
human
existence
as
the
day
advanced
towards
noon
we
entered
a
narrow
valley
not
very
flowery
but
sufficiently
verdant
our
guides
told
us
that
the
horses
could
not
travel
all
day
without
rest
or
meat
and
intreated
us
to
stop
here
because
no
grass
would
be
found
in
any
other
place
the
request
was
reasonable
and
the
argument
cogent
we
therefore
willingly
dismounted
and
diverted
ourselves
as
the
place
gave
us
opportunity
i
sat
down
on
a
bank
such
as
a
writer
of
romance
might
have
delighted
to
feign
i
had
indeed
no
trees
to
whisper
over
my
head
but
a
clear
rivulet
streamed
at
my
feet
the
day
was
calm
the
air
soft
and
all
was
rudeness
silence
and
solitude
before
me
and
on
either
side
were
high
hills
which
by
hindering
the
eye
from
ranging
forced
the
mind
to
find
entertainment
for
itself
whether
i
spent
the
hour
well
i
know
not
for
here
i
first
conceived
the
thought
of
this
narration
we
were
in
this
place
at
ease
and
by
choice
and
had
no
evils
to
suffer
or
to
fear
yet
the
imaginations
excited
by
the
view
of
an
unknown
and
untravelled
wilderness
are
not
such
as
arise
in
the
artificial
solitude
of
parks
and
gardens
a
flattering
notion
of
a
placid
indulgence
of
voluntary
delusions
a
secure
expansion
of
the
fancy
or
a
cool
concentration
of
the
mental
powers
the
phantoms
which
haunt
a
desert
are
want
and
misery
and
danger
the
evils
of
dereliction
rush
upon
the
thoughts
man
is
made
unwillingly
acquainted
with
his
own
weakness
and
meditation
shows
him
only
how
little
he
can
sustain
and
how
little
he
can
perform
there
were
no
traces
of
inhabitants
except
perhaps
a
rude
pile
of
clods
called
a
summer
hut
in
which
a
herdsman
had
rested
in
the
favourable
seasons
whoever
had
been
in
the
place
where
i
then
sat
unprovided
with
provisions
and
ignorant
of
the
country
might
at
least
before
the
roads
were
made
have
wandered
among
the
rocks
till
he
had
perished
with
hardship
before
he
could
have
found
either
food
or
shelter
yet
what
are
these
hillocks
to
the
ridges
of
taurus
or
these
spots
of
wildness
to
the
desarts
of
america
it
was
not
long
before
we
were
invited
to
mount
and
continued
our
journey
along
the
side
of
a
lough
kept
full
by
many
streams
which
with
more
or
less
rapidity
and
noise
crossed
the
road
from
the
hills
on
the
other
hand
these
currents
in
their
diminished
state
after
several
dry
months
afford
to
one
who
has
always
lived
in
level
countries
an
unusual
and
delightful
spectacle
but
in
the
rainy
season
such
as
every
winter
may
be
expected
to
bring
must
precipitate
an
impetuous
and
tremendous
flood
i
suppose
the
way
by
which
we
went
is
at
that
time
impassable
glensheals
the
lough
at
last
ended
in
a
river
broad
and
shallow
like
the
rest
but
that
it
may
be
passed
when
it
is
deeper
there
is
a
bridge
over
it
beyond
it
is
a
valley
called
glensheals
inhabited
by
the
clan
of
macrae
here
we
found
a
village
called
auknasheals
consisting
of
many
huts
perhaps
twenty
built
all
of
that
is
stones
piled
up
without
mortar
we
had
by
the
direction
of
the
officers
at
fort
augustus
taken
bread
for
ourselves
and
tobacco
for
those
highlanders
who
might
show
us
any
kindness
we
were
now
at
a
place
where
we
could
obtain
milk
but
we
must
have
wanted
bread
if
we
had
not
brought
it
the
people
of
this
valley
did
not
appear
to
know
any
english
and
our
guides
now
became
doubly
necessary
as
interpreters
a
woman
whose
hut
was
distinguished
by
greater
spaciousness
and
better
architecture
brought
out
some
pails
of
milk
the
villagers
gathered
about
us
in
considerable
numbers
i
believe
without
any
evil
intention
but
with
a
very
savage
wildness
of
aspect
and
manner
when
our
meal
was
over
boswell
sliced
the
bread
and
divided
it
amongst
them
as
he
supposed
them
never
to
have
tasted
a
wheaten
loaf
before
he
then
gave
them
little
pieces
of
twisted
tobacco
and
among
the
children
we
distributed
a
small
handful
of
halfpence
which
they
received
with
great
eagerness
yet
i
have
been
since
told
that
the
people
of
that
valley
are
not
indigent
and
when
we
mentioned
them
afterwards
as
needy
and
pitiable
a
highland
lady
let
us
know
that
we
might
spare
our
commiseration
for
the
dame
whose
milk
we
drank
had
probably
more
than
a
dozen
she
seemed
unwilling
to
take
any
price
but
being
pressed
to
make
a
demand
at
last
named
a
shilling
honesty
is
not
greater
where
elegance
is
less
one
of
the
bystanders
as
we
were
told
afterwards
advised
her
to
ask
for
more
but
she
said
a
shilling
was
enough
we
gave
her
half
a
crown
and
i
hope
got
some
credit
for
our
behaviour
for
the
company
said
if
our
interpreters
did
not
flatter
us
that
they
had
not
seen
such
a
day
since
the
old
laird
of
macleod
passed
through
their
country
the
macraes
as
we
heard
afterwards
in
the
hebrides
were
originally
an
indigent
and
subordinate
clan
and
having
no
farms
nor
stock
were
in
great
numbers
servants
to
the
maclellans
who
in
the
war
of
charles
the
first
took
arms
at
the
call
of
the
heroic
montrose
and
were
in
one
of
his
battles
almost
all
destroyed
the
women
that
were
left
at
home
being
thus
deprived
of
their
husbands
like
the
scythian
ladies
of
old
married
their
servants
and
the
macraes
became
a
considerable
race
the
highlands
as
we
continued
our
journey
we
were
at
leisure
to
extend
our
speculations
and
to
investigate
the
reason
of
those
peculiarities
by
which
such
rugged
regions
as
these
before
us
are
generally
distinguished
mountainous
countries
commonly
contain
the
original
at
least
the
oldest
race
of
inhabitants
for
they
are
not
easily
conquered
because
they
must
be
entered
by
narrow
ways
exposed
to
every
power
of
mischief
from
those
that
occupy
the
heights
and
every
new
ridge
is
a
new
fortress
where
the
defendants
have
again
the
same
advantages
if
the
assailants
either
force
the
strait
or
storm
the
summit
they
gain
only
so
much
ground
their
enemies
are
fled
to
take
possession
of
the
next
rock
and
the
pursuers
stand
at
gaze
knowing
neither
where
the
ways
of
escape
wind
among
the
steeps
nor
where
the
bog
has
firmness
to
sustain
them
besides
that
mountaineers
have
an
agility
in
climbing
and
descending
distinct
from
strength
or
courage
and
attainable
only
by
use
if
the
war
be
not
soon
concluded
the
invaders
are
dislodged
by
hunger
for
in
those
anxious
and
toilsome
marches
provisions
can
not
easily
be
carried
and
are
never
to
be
found
the
wealth
of
mountains
is
cattle
which
while
the
men
stand
in
the
passes
the
women
drive
away
such
lands
at
last
can
not
repay
the
expence
of
conquest
and
therefore
perhaps
have
not
been
so
often
invaded
by
the
mere
ambition
of
dominion
as
by
resentment
of
robberies
and
insults
or
the
desire
of
enjoying
in
security
the
more
fruitful
provinces
as
mountains
are
long
before
they
are
conquered
they
are
likewise
long
before
they
are
civilized
men
are
softened
by
intercourse
mutually
profitable
and
instructed
by
comparing
their
own
notions
with
those
of
others
thus
caesar
found
the
maritime
parts
of
britain
made
less
barbarous
by
their
commerce
with
the
gauls
into
a
barren
and
rough
tract
no
stranger
is
brought
either
by
the
hope
of
gain
or
of
pleasure
the
inhabitants
having
neither
commodities
for
sale
nor
money
for
purchase
seldom
visit
more
polished
places
or
if
they
do
visit
them
seldom
return
it
sometimes
happens
that
by
conquest
intermixture
or
gradual
refinement
the
cultivated
parts
of
a
country
change
their
language
the
mountaineers
then
become
a
distinct
nation
cut
off
by
dissimilitude
of
speech
from
conversation
with
their
neighbours
thus
in
biscay
the
original
cantabrian
and
in
dalecarlia
the
old
swedish
still
subsists
thus
wales
and
the
highlands
speak
the
tongue
of
the
first
inhabitants
of
britain
while
the
other
parts
have
received
first
the
saxon
and
in
some
degree
afterwards
the
french
and
then
formed
a
third
language
between
them
that
the
primitive
manners
are
continued
where
the
primitive
language
is
spoken
no
nation
will
desire
me
to
suppose
for
the
manners
of
mountaineers
are
commonly
savage
but
they
are
rather
produced
by
their
situation
than
derived
from
their
ancestors
such
seems
to
be
the
disposition
of
man
that
whatever
makes
a
distinction
produces
rivalry
england
before
other
causes
of
enmity
were
found
was
disturbed
for
some
centuries
by
the
contests
of
the
northern
and
southern
counties
so
that
at
oxford
the
peace
of
study
could
for
a
long
time
be
preserved
only
by
chusing
annually
one
of
the
proctors
from
each
side
of
the
trent
a
tract
intersected
by
many
ridges
of
mountains
naturally
divides
its
inhabitants
into
petty
nations
which
are
made
by
a
thousand
causes
enemies
to
each
other
each
will
exalt
its
own
chiefs
each
will
boast
the
valour
of
its
men
or
the
beauty
of
its
women
and
every
claim
of
superiority
irritates
competition
injuries
will
sometimes
be
done
and
be
more
injuriously
defended
retaliation
will
sometimes
be
attempted
and
the
debt
exacted
with
too
much
interest
in
the
highlands
it
was
a
law
that
if
a
robber
was
sheltered
from
justice
any
man
of
the
same
clan
might
be
taken
in
his
place
this
was
a
kind
of
irregular
justice
which
though
necessary
in
savage
times
could
hardly
fail
to
end
in
a
feud
and
a
feud
once
kindled
among
an
idle
people
with
no
variety
of
pursuits
to
divert
their
thoughts
burnt
on
for
ages
either
sullenly
glowing
in
secret
mischief
or
openly
blazing
into
public
violence
of
the
effects
of
this
violent
judicature
there
are
not
wanting
memorials
the
cave
is
now
to
be
seen
to
which
one
of
the
campbells
who
had
injured
the
macdonalds
retired
with
a
body
of
his
own
clan
the
macdonalds
required
the
offender
and
being
refused
made
a
fire
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
by
which
he
and
his
adherents
were
suffocated
together
mountaineers
are
warlike
because
by
their
feuds
and
competitions
they
consider
themselves
as
surrounded
with
enemies
and
are
always
prepared
to
repel
incursions
or
to
make
them
like
the
greeks
in
their
unpolished
state
described
by
thucydides
the
highlanders
till
lately
went
always
armed
and
carried
their
weapons
to
visits
and
to
church
mountaineers
are
thievish
because
they
are
poor
and
having
neither
manufactures
nor
commerce
can
grow
richer
only
by
robbery
they
regularly
plunder
their
neighbours
for
their
neighbours
are
commonly
their
enemies
and
having
lost
that
reverence
for
property
by
which
the
order
of
civil
life
is
preserved
soon
consider
all
as
enemies
whom
they
do
not
reckon
as
friends
and
think
themselves
licensed
to
invade
whatever
they
are
not
obliged
to
protect
by
a
strict
administration
of
the
laws
since
the
laws
have
been
introduced
into
the
highlands
this
disposition
to
thievery
is
very
much
represt
thirty
years
ago
no
herd
had
ever
been
conducted
through
the
mountains
without
paying
tribute
in
the
night
to
some
of
the
clans
but
cattle
are
now
driven
and
passengers
travel
without
danger
fear
or
molestation
among
a
warlike
people
the
quality
of
highest
esteem
is
personal
courage
and
with
the
ostentatious
display
of
courage
are
closely
connected
promptitude
of
offence
and
quickness
of
resentment
the
highlanders
before
they
were
disarmed
were
so
addicted
to
quarrels
that
the
boys
used
to
follow
any
publick
procession
or
ceremony
however
festive
or
however
solemn
in
expectation
of
the
battle
which
was
sure
to
happen
before
the
company
dispersed
mountainous
regions
are
sometimes
so
remote
from
the
seat
of
government
and
so
difficult
of
access
that
they
are
very
little
under
the
influence
of
the
sovereign
or
within
the
reach
of
national
justice
law
is
nothing
without
power
and
the
sentence
of
a
distant
court
could
not
be
easily
executed
nor
perhaps
very
safely
promulgated
among
men
ignorantly
proud
and
habitually
violent
unconnected
with
the
general
system
and
accustomed
to
reverence
only
their
own
lords
it
has
therefore
been
necessary
to
erect
many
particular
jurisdictions
and
commit
the
punishment
of
crimes
and
the
decision
of
right
to
the
proprietors
of
the
country
who
could
enforce
their
own
decrees
it
immediately
appears
that
such
judges
will
be
often
ignorant
and
often
partial
but
in
the
immaturity
of
political
establishments
no
better
expedient
could
be
found
as
government
advances
towards
perfection
provincial
judicature
is
perhaps
in
every
empire
gradually
abolished
those
who
had
thus
the
dispensation
of
law
were
by
consequence
themselves
lawless
their
vassals
had
no
shelter
from
outrages
and
oppressions
but
were
condemned
to
endure
without
resistance
the
caprices
of
wantonness
and
the
rage
of
cruelty
in
the
highlands
some
great
lords
had
an
hereditary
jurisdiction
over
counties
and
some
chieftains
over
their
own
lands
till
the
final
conquest
of
the
highlands
afforded
an
opportunity
of
crushing
all
the
local
courts
and
of
extending
the
general
benefits
of
equal
law
to
the
low
and
the
high
in
the
deepest
recesses
and
obscurest
corners
while
the
chiefs
had
this
resemblance
of
royalty
they
had
little
inclination
to
appeal
on
any
question
to
superior
judicatures
a
claim
of
lands
between
two
powerful
lairds
was
decided
like
a
contest
for
dominion
between
sovereign
powers
they
drew
their
forces
into
the
field
and
right
attended
on
the
strongest
this
was
in
ruder
times
the
common
practice
which
the
kings
of
scotland
could
seldom
control
even
so
lately
as
in
the
last
years
of
king
william
a
battle
was
fought
at
mull
roy
on
a
plain
a
few
miles
to
the
south
of
inverness
between
the
clans
of
mackintosh
and
macdonald
of
keppoch
macdonald
the
head
of
a
small
clan
refused
to
pay
the
dues
demanded
from
him
by
mackintosh
as
his
superior
lord
they
disdained
the
interposition
of
judges
and
laws
and
calling
each
his
followers
to
maintain
the
dignity
of
the
clan
fought
a
formal
battle
in
which
several
considerable
men
fell
on
the
side
of
mackintosh
without
a
complete
victory
to
either
this
is
said
to
have
been
the
last
open
war
made
between
the
clans
by
their
own
authority
the
highland
lords
made
treaties
and
formed
alliances
of
which
some
traces
may
still
be
found
and
some
consequences
still
remain
as
lasting
evidences
of
petty
regality
the
terms
of
one
of
these
confederacies
were
that
each
should
support
the
other
in
the
right
or
in
the
wrong
except
against
the
king
the
inhabitants
of
mountains
form
distinct
races
and
are
careful
to
preserve
their
genealogies
men
in
a
small
district
necessarily
mingle
blood
by
intermarriages
and
combine
at
last
into
one
family
with
a
common
interest
in
the
honour
and
disgrace
of
every
individual
then
begins
that
union
of
affections
and
of
endeavours
that
constitute
a
clan
they
who
consider
themselves
as
ennobled
by
their
family
will
think
highly
of
their
progenitors
and
they
who
through
successive
generations
live
always
together
in
the
same
place
will
preserve
local
stories
and
hereditary
prejudices
thus
every
highlander
can
talk
of
his
ancestors
and
recount
the
outrages
which
they
suffered
from
the
wicked
inhabitants
of
the
next
valley
such
are
the
effects
of
habitation
among
mountains
and
such
were
the
qualities
of
the
highlanders
while
their
rocks
secluded
them
from
the
rest
of
mankind
and
kept
them
an
unaltered
and
discriminated
race
they
are
now
losing
their
distinction
and
hastening
to
mingle
with
the
general
community
glenelg
we
left
auknasheals
and
the
macraes
its
the
afternoon
and
in
the
evening
came
to
ratiken
a
high
hill
on
which
a
road
is
cut
but
so
steep
and
narrow
that
it
is
very
difficult
there
is
now
a
design
of
making
another
way
round
the
bottom
upon
one
of
the
precipices
my
horse
weary
with
the
steepness
of
the
rise
staggered
a
little
and
i
called
in
haste
to
the
highlander
to
hold
him
this
was
the
only
moment
of
my
journey
in
which
i
thought
myself
endangered
having
surmounted
the
hill
at
last
we
were
told
that
at
glenelg
on
the
we
should
come
to
a
house
of
lime
and
slate
and
glass
this
image
of
magnificence
raised
our
expectation
at
last
we
came
to
our
inn
weary
and
peevish
and
began
to
inquire
for
meat
and
beds
of
the
provisions
the
negative
catalogue
was
very
copious
here
was
no
meat
no
milk
no
bread
no
eggs
no
wine
we
did
not
express
much
satisfaction
here
however
we
were
to
stay
whisky
we
might
have
and
i
believe
at
last
they
caught
a
fowl
and
killed
it
we
had
some
bread
and
with
that
we
prepared
ourselves
to
be
contented
when
we
had
a
very
eminent
proof
of
highland
hospitality
along
some
miles
of
the
way
in
the
evening
a
gentleman
servant
had
kept
us
company
on
foot
with
very
little
notice
on
our
part
he
left
us
near
glenelg
and
we
thought
on
him
no
more
till
he
came
to
us
again
in
about
two
hours
with
a
present
from
his
master
of
rum
and
sugar
the
man
had
mentioned
his
company
and
the
gentleman
whose
name
i
think
is
gordon
well
knowing
the
penury
of
the
place
had
this
attention
to
two
men
whose
names
perhaps
he
had
not
heard
by
whom
his
kindness
was
not
likely
to
be
ever
repaid
and
who
could
be
recommended
to
him
only
by
their
necessities
we
were
now
to
examine
our
lodging
out
of
one
of
the
beds
on
which
we
were
to
repose
started
up
at
our
entrance
a
man
black
as
a
cyclops
from
the
forge
other
circumstances
of
no
elegant
recital
concurred
to
disgust
us
we
had
been
frighted
by
a
lady
at
edinburgh
with
discouraging
representations
of
highland
lodgings
sleep
however
was
necessary
our
highlanders
had
at
last
found
some
hay
with
which
the
inn
could
not
supply
them
i
directed
them
to
bring
a
bundle
into
the
room
and
slept
upon
it
in
my
riding
coat
boswell
being
more
delicate
laid
himself
sheets
with
hay
over
and
under
him
and
lay
in
linen
like
a
gentleman
sky
armidel
in
the
morning
september
the
second
we
found
ourselves
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
having
procured
a
boat
we
dismissed
our
highlanders
whom
i
would
recommend
to
the
service
of
any
future
travellers
and
were
ferried
over
to
the
isle
of
sky
we
landed
at
armidel
where
we
were
met
on
the
sands
by
sir
alexander
macdonald
who
was
at
that
time
there
with
his
lady
preparing
to
leave
the
island
and
reside
at
edinburgh
armidel
is
a
neat
house
built
where
the
macdonalds
had
once
a
seat
which
was
burnt
in
the
commotions
that
followed
the
revolution
the
walled
orchard
which
belonged
to
the
former
house
still
remains
it
is
well
shaded
by
tall
ash
trees
of
a
species
as
janes
the
fossilist
informed
me
uncommonly
valuable
this
plantation
is
very
properly
mentioned
by
campbell
in
his
new
account
of
the
state
of
britain
and
deserves
attention
because
it
proves
that
the
present
nakedness
of
the
hebrides
is
not
wholly
the
fault
of
nature
as
we
sat
at
sir
alexander
table
we
were
entertained
according
to
the
ancient
usage
of
the
north
with
the
melody
of
the
bagpipe
everything
in
those
countries
has
its
history
as
the
bagpiper
was
playing
an
elderly
gentleman
informed
us
that
in
some
remote
time
the
macdonalds
of
glengary
having
been
injured
or
offended
by
the
inhabitants
of
culloden
and
resolving
to
have
justice
or
vengeance
came
to
culloden
on
a
sunday
where
finding
their
enemies
at
worship
they
shut
them
up
in
the
church
which
they
set
on
fire
and
this
said
he
is
the
tune
that
the
piper
played
while
they
were
burning
narrations
like
this
however
uncertain
deserve
the
notice
of
the
traveller
because
they
are
the
only
records
of
a
nation
that
has
no
historians
and
afford
the
most
genuine
representation
of
the
life
and
character
of
the
ancient
highlanders
under
the
denomination
of
highlander
are
comprehended
in
scotland
all
that
now
speak
the
erse
language
or
retain
the
primitive
manners
whether
they
live
among
the
mountains
or
in
the
islands
and
in
that
sense
i
use
the
name
when
there
is
not
some
apparent
reason
for
making
a
distinction
in
sky
i
first
observed
the
use
of
brogues
a
kind
of
artless
shoes
stitched
with
thongs
so
loosely
that
though
they
defend
the
foot
from
stones
they
do
not
exclude
water
brogues
were
formerly
made
of
raw
hides
with
the
hair
inwards
and
such
are
perhaps
still
used
in
rude
and
remote
parts
but
they
are
said
not
to
last
above
two
days
where
life
is
somewhat
improved
they
are
now
made
of
leather
tanned
with
oak
bark
as
in
other
places
or
with
the
bark
of
birch
or
roots
of
tormentil
a
substance
recommended
in
defect
of
bark
about
forty
years
ago
to
the
irish
tanners
by
one
to
whom
the
parliament
of
that
kingdom
voted
a
reward
the
leather
of
sky
is
not
completely
penetrated
by
vegetable
matter
and
therefore
can
not
be
very
durable
my
inquiries
about
brogues
gave
me
an
early
specimen
of
highland
information
one
day
i
was
told
that
to
make
brogues
was
a
domestick
art
which
every
man
practised
for
himself
and
that
a
pair
of
brogues
was
the
work
of
an
hour
i
supposed
that
the
husband
made
brogues
as
the
wife
made
an
apron
till
next
day
it
was
told
me
that
a
was
a
trade
and
that
a
pair
would
cost
half
a
crown
it
will
easily
occur
that
these
representations
may
both
be
true
and
that
in
some
places
men
may
buy
them
and
in
others
make
them
for
themselves
but
i
had
both
the
accounts
in
the
same
house
within
two
days
many
of
my
subsequent
inquiries
upon
more
interesting
topicks
ended
in
the
like
uncertainty
he
that
travels
in
the
highlands
may
easily
saturate
his
soul
with
intelligence
if
he
will
acquiesce
in
the
first
account
the
highlander
gives
to
every
question
an
answer
so
prompt
and
peremptory
that
skepticism
itself
is
dared
into
silence
and
the
mind
sinks
before
the
bold
reporter
in
unresisting
credulity
but
if
a
second
question
be
ventured
it
breaks
the
enchantment
for
it
is
immediately
discovered
that
what
was
told
so
confidently
was
told
at
hazard
and
that
such
fearlessness
of
assertion
was
either
the
sport
of
negligence
or
the
refuge
of
ignorance
if
individuals
are
thus
at
variance
with
themselves
it
can
be
no
wonder
that
the
accounts
of
different
men
are
contradictory
the
traditions
of
an
ignorant
and
savage
people
have
been
for
ages
negligently
heard
and
unskilfully
related
distant
events
must
have
been
mingled
together
and
the
actions
of
one
man
given
to
another
these
however
are
deficiencies
in
story
for
which
no
man
is
now
to
be
censured
it
were
enough
if
what
there
is
yet
opportunity
of
examining
were
accurately
inspected
and
justly
represented
but
such
is
the
laxity
of
highland
conversation
that
the
inquirer
is
kept
in
continual
suspense
and
by
a
kind
of
intellectual
retrogradation
knows
less
as
he
hears
more
in
the
islands
the
plaid
is
rarely
worn
the
law
by
which
the
highlanders
have
been
obliged
to
change
the
form
of
their
dress
has
in
all
the
places
that
we
have
visited
been
universally
obeyed
i
have
seen
only
one
gentleman
completely
clothed
in
the
ancient
habit
and
by
him
it
was
worn
only
occasionally
and
wantonly
the
common
people
do
not
think
themselves
under
any
legal
necessity
of
having
coats
for
they
say
that
the
law
against
plaids
was
made
by
lord
hardwicke
and
was
in
force
only
for
his
life
but
the
same
poverty
that
made
it
then
difficult
for
them
to
change
their
clothing
hinders
them
now
from
changing
it
again
the
fillibeg
or
lower
garment
is
still
very
common
and
the
bonnet
almost
universal
but
their
attire
is
such
as
produces
in
a
sufficient
degree
the
effect
intended
by
the
law
of
abolishing
the
dissimilitude
of
appearance
between
the
highlanders
and
the
other
inhabitants
of
britain
and
if
dress
be
supposed
to
have
much
influence
facilitates
their
coalition
with
their
what
we
have
long
used
we
naturally
like
and
therefore
the
highlanders
were
unwilling
to
lay
aside
their
plaid
which
yet
to
an
unprejudiced
spectator
must
appear
an
incommodious
and
cumbersome
dress
for
hanging
loose
upon
the
body
it
must
flutter
in
a
quick
motion
or
require
one
of
the
hands
to
keep
it
close
the
romans
always
laid
aside
the
gown
when
they
had
anything
to
do
it
was
a
dress
so
unsuitable
to
war
that
the
same
word
which
signified
a
gown
signified
peace
the
chief
use
of
a
plaid
seems
to
be
this
that
they
could
commodiously
wrap
themselves
in
it
when
they
were
obliged
to
sleep
without
a
better
cover
in
our
passage
from
scotland
to
sky
we
were
wet
for
the
first
time
with
a
shower
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
highland
winter
after
which
we
were
told
that
a
succession
of
three
dry
days
was
not
to
be
expected
for
many
months
the
winter
of
the
hebrides
consists
of
little
more
than
rain
and
wind
as
they
are
surrounded
by
an
ocean
never
frozen
the
blasts
that
come
to
them
over
the
water
are
too
much
softened
to
have
the
power
of
congelation
the
salt
loughs
or
inlets
of
the
sea
which
shoot
very
far
into
the
island
never
have
any
ice
upon
them
and
the
pools
of
fresh
water
will
never
bear
the
walker
the
snow
that
sometimes
falls
is
soon
dissolved
by
the
air
or
the
rain
this
is
not
the
description
of
a
cruel
climate
yet
the
dark
months
are
here
a
time
of
great
distress
because
the
summer
can
do
little
more
than
feed
itself
and
winter
comes
with
its
cold
and
its
scarcity
upon
families
very
slenderly
provided
coriatachan
in
sky
the
third
or
fourth
day
after
our
arrival
at
armidel
brought
us
an
invitation
to
the
isle
of
raasay
which
lies
east
of
sky
it
is
incredible
how
soon
the
account
of
any
event
is
propagated
in
these
narrow
countries
by
the
love
of
talk
which
much
leisure
produces
and
the
relief
given
to
the
mind
in
the
penury
of
insular
conversation
by
a
new
topick
the
arrival
of
strangers
at
a
place
so
rarely
visited
excites
rumour
and
quickens
curiosity
i
know
not
whether
we
touched
at
any
corner
where
fame
had
not
already
prepared
us
a
reception
to
gain
a
commodious
passage
to
raasay
it
was
necessary
to
pass
over
a
large
part
of
sky
we
were
furnished
therefore
with
horses
and
a
guide
in
the
islands
there
are
no
roads
nor
any
marks
by
which
a
stranger
may
find
his
way
the
horseman
has
always
at
his
side
a
native
of
the
place
who
by
pursuing
game
or
tending
cattle
or
being
often
employed
in
messages
or
conduct
has
learned
where
the
ridge
of
the
hill
has
breadth
sufficient
to
allow
a
horse
and
his
rider
a
passage
and
where
the
moss
or
bog
is
hard
enough
to
bear
them
the
bogs
are
avoided
as
toilsome
at
least
if
not
unsafe
and
therefore
the
journey
is
made
generally
from
precipice
to
precipice
from
which
if
the
eye
ventures
to
look
down
it
sees
below
a
gloomy
cavity
whence
the
rush
of
water
is
sometimes
heard
but
there
seems
to
be
in
all
this
more
alarm
than
danger
the
highlander
walks
carefully
before
and
the
horse
accustomed
to
the
ground
follows
him
with
little
deviation
sometimes
the
hill
is
too
steep
for
the
horseman
to
keep
his
seat
and
sometimes
the
moss
is
too
tremulous
to
bear
the
double
weight
of
horse
and
man
the
rider
then
dismounts
and
all
shift
as
they
can
journies
made
in
this
manner
are
rather
tedious
than
long
a
very
few
miles
require
several
hours
from
armidel
we
came
at
night
to
coriatachan
a
house
very
pleasantly
situated
between
two
brooks
with
one
of
the
highest
hills
of
the
island
behind
it
it
is
the
residence
of
mackinnon
by
whom
we
were
treated
with
very
liberal
hospitality
among
a
more
numerous
and
elegant
company
than
it
could
have
been
supposed
easy
to
collect
the
hill
behind
the
house
we
did
not
climb
the
weather
was
rough
and
the
height
and
steepness
discouraged
us
we
were
told
that
there
is
a
cairne
upon
it
a
cairne
is
a
heap
of
stones
thrown
upon
the
grave
of
one
eminent
for
dignity
of
birth
or
splendour
of
atchievements
it
is
said
that
by
digging
an
urn
is
always
found
under
these
cairnes
they
must
therefore
have
been
thus
piled
by
a
people
whose
custom
was
to
burn
the
dead
to
pile
stones
is
i
believe
a
northern
custom
and
to
burn
the
body
was
the
roman
practice
nor
do
i
know
when
it
was
that
these
two
acts
of
sepulture
were
united
the
weather
was
next
day
too
violent
for
the
continuation
of
our
journey
but
we
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
the
interruption
we
saw
in
every
place
what
we
chiefly
desired
to
know
the
manners
of
the
people
we
had
company
and
if
we
had
chosen
retirement
we
might
have
had
books
i
never
was
in
any
house
of
the
islands
where
i
did
not
find
books
in
more
languages
than
one
if
i
staid
long
enough
to
want
them
except
one
from
which
the
family
was
removed
literature
is
not
neglected
by
the
higher
rank
of
the
hebridians
it
need
not
i
suppose
be
mentioned
that
in
countries
so
little
frequented
as
the
islands
there
are
no
houses
where
travellers
are
entertained
for
money
he
that
wanders
about
these
wilds
either
procures
recommendations
to
those
whose
habitations
lie
near
his
way
or
when
night
and
weariness
come
upon
him
takes
the
chance
of
general
hospitality
if
he
finds
only
a
cottage
he
can
expect
little
more
than
shelter
for
the
cottagers
have
little
more
for
themselves
but
if
his
good
fortune
brings
him
to
the
residence
of
a
gentleman
he
will
be
glad
of
a
storm
to
prolong
his
stay
there
is
however
one
inn
by
the
side
at
sconsor
in
sky
where
the
is
kept
at
the
tables
where
a
stranger
is
received
neither
plenty
nor
delicacy
is
wanting
a
tract
of
land
so
thinly
inhabited
must
have
much
fowl
and
i
scarcely
remember
to
have
seen
a
dinner
without
them
the
moorgame
is
every
where
to
be
had
that
the
sea
abounds
with
fish
needs
not
be
told
for
it
supplies
a
great
part
of
europe
the
isle
of
sky
has
stags
and
roebucks
but
no
hares
they
sell
very
numerous
droves
of
oxen
yearly
to
england
and
therefore
can
not
be
supposed
to
want
beef
at
home
sheep
and
goats
are
in
great
numbers
and
they
have
the
common
domestick
fowls
but
as
here
is
nothing
to
be
bought
every
family
must
kill
its
own
meat
and
roast
part
of
it
somewhat
sooner
than
apicius
would
prescribe
every
kind
of
flesh
is
undoubtedly
excelled
by
the
variety
and
emulation
of
english
markets
but
that
which
is
not
best
may
be
yet
very
far
from
bad
and
he
that
shall
complain
of
his
fare
in
the
hebrides
has
improved
his
delicacy
more
than
his
manhood
their
fowls
are
not
like
those
plumped
for
sale
by
the
poulterers
of
london
but
they
are
as
good
as
other
places
commonly
afford
except
that
the
geese
by
feeding
in
the
sea
have
universally
a
fishy
rankness
these
geese
seem
to
be
of
a
middle
race
between
the
wild
and
domestick
kinds
they
are
so
tame
as
to
own
a
home
and
so
wild
as
sometimes
to
fly
quite
away
their
native
bread
is
made
of
oats
or
barley
of
oatmeal
they
spread
very
thin
cakes
coarse
and
hard
to
which
unaccustomed
palates
are
not
easily
reconciled
the
barley
cakes
are
thicker
and
softer
i
began
to
eat
them
without
unwillingness
the
blackness
of
their
colour
raises
some
dislike
but
the
taste
is
not
disagreeable
in
most
houses
there
is
wheat
flower
with
which
we
were
sure
to
be
treated
if
we
staid
long
enough
to
have
it
kneaded
and
baked
as
neither
yeast
nor
leaven
are
used
among
them
their
bread
of
every
kind
is
unfermented
they
make
only
cakes
and
never
mould
a
loaf
a
man
of
the
hebrides
for
of
the
women
diet
i
can
give
no
account
as
soon
as
he
appears
in
the
morning
swallows
a
glass
of
whisky
yet
they
are
not
a
drunken
race
at
least
i
never
was
present
at
much
intemperance
but
no
man
is
so
abstemious
as
to
refuse
the
morning
dram
which
they
call
a
skalk
the
word
whisky
signifies
water
and
is
applied
by
way
of
eminence
to
strong
water
or
distilled
liquor
the
spirit
drunk
in
the
north
is
drawn
from
barley
i
never
tasted
it
except
once
for
experiment
at
the
inn
in
inverary
when
i
thought
it
preferable
to
any
english
malt
brandy
it
was
strong
but
not
pungent
and
was
free
from
the
empyreumatick
taste
or
smell
what
was
the
process
i
had
no
opportunity
of
inquiring
nor
do
i
wish
to
improve
the
art
of
making
poison
pleasant
not
long
after
the
dram
may
be
expected
the
breakfast
a
meal
in
which
the
scots
whether
of
the
lowlands
or
mountains
must
be
confessed
to
excel
us
the
tea
and
coffee
are
accompanied
not
only
with
butter
but
with
honey
conserves
and
marmalades
if
an
epicure
could
remove
by
a
wish
in
quest
of
sensual
gratifications
wherever
he
had
supped
he
would
breakfast
in
scotland
in
the
islands
however
they
do
what
i
found
it
not
very
easy
to
endure
they
pollute
the
by
plates
piled
with
large
slices
of
cheshire
cheese
which
mingles
its
less
grateful
odours
with
the
fragrance
of
the
tea
where
many
questions
are
to
be
asked
some
will
be
omitted
i
forgot
to
inquire
how
they
were
supplied
with
so
much
exotic
luxury
perhaps
the
french
may
bring
them
wine
for
wool
and
the
dutch
give
them
tea
and
coffee
at
the
fishing
season
in
exchange
for
fresh
provision
their
trade
is
unconstrained
they
pay
no
customs
for
there
is
no
officer
to
demand
them
whatever
therefore
is
made
dear
only
by
impost
is
obtained
here
at
an
easy
rate
a
dinner
in
the
western
islands
differs
very
little
from
a
dinner
in
england
except
that
in
the
place
of
tarts
there
are
always
set
different
preparations
of
milk
this
part
of
their
diet
will
admit
some
improvement
though
they
have
milk
and
eggs
and
sugar
few
of
them
know
how
to
compound
them
in
a
custard
their
gardens
afford
them
no
great
variety
but
they
have
always
some
vegetables
on
the
table
potatoes
at
least
are
never
wanting
which
though
they
have
not
known
them
long
are
now
one
of
the
principal
parts
of
their
food
they
are
not
of
the
mealy
but
the
viscous
kind
their
more
elaborate
cookery
or
made
dishes
an
englishman
at
the
first
taste
is
not
likely
to
approve
but
the
culinary
compositions
of
every
country
are
often
such
as
become
grateful
to
other
nations
only
by
degrees
though
i
have
read
a
french
author
who
in
the
elation
of
his
heart
says
that
french
cookery
pleases
all
foreigners
but
foreign
cookery
never
satisfies
a
frenchman
their
suppers
are
like
their
dinners
various
and
plentiful
the
table
is
always
covered
with
elegant
linen
their
plates
for
common
use
are
often
of
that
kind
of
manufacture
which
is
called
cream
coloured
or
queen
ware
they
use
silver
on
all
occasions
where
it
is
common
in
england
nor
did
i
ever
find
the
spoon
of
horn
but
in
one
house
the
knives
are
not
often
either
very
bright
or
very
sharp
they
are
indeed
instruments
of
which
the
highlanders
have
not
been
long
acquainted
with
the
general
use
they
were
not
regularly
laid
on
the
table
before
the
prohibition
of
arms
and
the
change
of
dress
thirty
years
ago
the
highlander
wore
his
knife
as
a
companion
to
his
dirk
or
dagger
and
when
the
company
sat
down
to
meat
the
men
who
had
knives
cut
the
flesh
into
small
pieces
for
the
women
who
with
their
fingers
conveyed
it
to
their
mouths
there
was
perhaps
never
any
change
of
national
manners
so
quick
so
great
and
so
general
as
that
which
has
operated
in
the
highlands
by
the
last
conquest
and
the
subsequent
laws
we
came
thither
too
late
to
see
what
we
expected
a
people
of
peculiar
appearance
and
a
system
of
antiquated
life
the
clans
retain
little
now
of
their
original
character
their
ferocity
of
temper
is
softened
their
military
ardour
is
extinguished
their
dignity
of
independence
is
depressed
their
contempt
of
government
subdued
and
the
reverence
for
their
chiefs
abated
of
what
they
had
before
the
late
conquest
of
their
country
there
remain
only
their
language
and
their
poverty
their
language
is
attacked
on
every
side
schools
are
erected
in
which
english
only
is
taught
and
there
were
lately
some
who
thought
it
reasonable
to
refuse
them
a
version
of
the
holy
scriptures
that
they
might
have
no
monument
of
their
tongue
that
their
poverty
is
gradually
abated
can
not
be
mentioned
among
the
unpleasing
consequences
of
subjection
they
are
now
acquainted
with
money
and
the
possibility
of
gain
will
by
degrees
make
them
industrious
such
is
the
effect
of
the
late
regulations
that
a
longer
journey
than
to
the
highlands
must
be
taken
by
him
whose
curiosity
pants
for
savage
virtues
and
barbarous
grandeur
raasay
at
the
first
intermission
of
the
stormy
weather
we
were
informed
that
the
boat
which
was
to
convey
us
to
raasay
attended
us
on
the
coast
we
had
from
this
time
our
intelligence
facilitated
and
our
conversation
enlarged
by
the
company
of
macqueen
minister
of
a
parish
in
sky
whose
knowledge
and
politeness
give
him
a
title
equally
to
kindness
and
respect
and
who
from
this
time
never
forsook
us
till
we
were
preparing
to
leave
sky
and
the
adjacent
places
the
boat
was
under
the
direction
of
malcolm
macleod
a
gentleman
of
raasay
the
water
was
calm
and
the
rowers
were
vigorous
so
that
our
passage
was
quick
and
pleasant
when
we
came
near
the
island
we
saw
the
laird
house
a
neat
modern
fabrick
and
found
macleod
the
proprietor
of
the
island
with
many
gentlemen
expecting
us
on
the
beach
we
had
as
at
all
other
places
some
difficulty
in
landing
the
craggs
were
irregularly
broken
and
a
false
step
would
have
been
very
mischievous
it
seemed
that
the
rocks
might
with
no
great
labour
have
been
hewn
almost
into
a
regular
flight
of
steps
and
as
there
are
no
other
landing
places
i
considered
this
rugged
ascent
as
the
consequence
of
a
form
of
life
inured
to
hardships
and
therefore
not
studious
of
nice
accommodations
but
i
know
not
whether
for
many
ages
it
was
not
considered
as
a
part
of
military
policy
to
keep
the
country
not
easily
accessible
the
rocks
are
natural
fortifications
and
an
enemy
climbing
with
difficulty
was
easily
destroyed
by
those
who
stood
high
above
him
our
reception
exceeded
our
expectations
we
found
nothing
but
civility
elegance
and
plenty
after
the
usual
refreshments
and
the
usual
conversation
the
evening
came
upon
us
the
carpet
was
then
rolled
off
the
floor
the
musician
was
called
and
the
whole
company
was
invited
to
dance
nor
did
ever
fairies
trip
with
greater
alacrity
the
general
air
of
festivity
which
predominated
in
this
place
so
far
remote
from
all
those
regions
which
the
mind
has
been
used
to
contemplate
as
the
mansions
of
pleasure
struck
the
imagination
with
a
delightful
surprise
analogous
to
that
which
is
felt
at
an
unexpected
emersion
from
darkness
into
light
when
it
was
time
to
sup
the
dance
ceased
and
six
and
thirty
persons
sat
down
to
two
tables
in
the
same
room
after
supper
the
ladies
sung
erse
songs
to
which
i
listened
as
an
english
audience
to
an
italian
opera
delighted
with
the
sound
of
words
which
i
did
not
understand
i
inquired
the
subjects
of
the
songs
and
was
told
of
one
that
it
was
a
love
song
and
of
another
that
it
was
a
farewell
composed
by
one
of
the
islanders
that
was
going
in
this
epidemical
fury
of
emigration
to
seek
his
fortune
in
america
what
sentiments
would
arise
on
such
an
occasion
in
the
heart
of
one
who
had
not
been
taught
to
lament
by
precedent
i
should
gladly
have
known
but
the
lady
by
whom
i
sat
thought
herself
not
equal
to
the
work
of
translating
macleod
is
the
proprietor
of
the
islands
of
raasay
rona
and
fladda
and
possesses
an
extensive
district
in
sky
the
estate
has
not
during
four
hundred
years
gained
or
lost
a
single
acre
he
acknowledges
macleod
of
dunvegan
as
his
chief
though
his
ancestors
have
formerly
disputed
the
one
of
the
old
highland
alliances
has
continued
for
two
hundred
years
and
is
still
subsisting
between
macleod
of
raasay
and
macdonald
of
sky
in
consequence
of
which
the
survivor
always
inherits
the
arms
of
the
deceased
a
natural
memorial
of
military
friendship
at
the
death
of
the
late
sir
james
macdonald
his
sword
was
delivered
to
the
present
laird
of
raasay
the
family
of
raasay
consists
of
the
laird
the
lady
three
sons
and
ten
daughters
for
the
sons
there
is
a
tutor
in
the
house
and
the
lady
is
said
to
be
very
skilful
and
diligent
in
the
education
of
her
girls
more
gentleness
of
manners
or
a
more
pleasing
appearance
of
domestick
society
is
not
found
in
the
most
polished
countries
raasay
is
the
only
inhabited
island
in
macleod
possession
rona
and
fladda
afford
only
pasture
for
cattle
of
which
one
hundred
and
sixty
winter
in
rona
under
the
superintendence
of
a
solitary
herdsman
the
length
of
raasay
is
by
computation
fifteen
miles
and
the
breadth
two
these
countries
have
never
been
measured
and
the
computation
by
miles
is
negligent
and
arbitrary
we
observed
in
travelling
that
the
nominal
and
real
distance
of
places
had
very
little
relation
to
each
other
raasay
probably
contains
near
a
hundred
square
miles
it
affords
not
much
ground
notwithstanding
its
extent
either
for
tillage
or
pasture
for
it
is
rough
rocky
and
barren
the
cattle
often
perish
by
falling
from
the
precipices
it
is
like
the
other
islands
i
think
generally
naked
of
shade
but
it
is
naked
by
neglect
for
the
laird
has
an
orchard
and
very
large
forest
trees
grow
about
his
house
like
other
hilly
countries
it
has
many
rivulets
one
of
the
brooks
turns
a
mill
and
at
least
one
produces
trouts
in
the
streams
or
fresh
lakes
of
the
islands
i
have
never
heard
of
any
other
fish
than
trouts
and
eels
the
trouts
which
i
have
seen
are
not
large
the
colour
of
their
flesh
is
tinged
as
in
england
of
their
eels
i
can
give
no
account
having
never
tasted
them
for
i
believe
they
are
not
considered
as
wholesome
food
it
is
not
very
easy
to
fix
the
principles
upon
which
mankind
have
agreed
to
eat
some
animals
and
reject
others
and
as
the
principle
is
not
evident
it
is
not
uniform
that
which
is
selected
as
delicate
in
one
country
is
by
its
neighbours
abhorred
as
loathsome
the
neapolitans
lately
refused
to
eat
potatoes
in
a
famine
an
englishman
is
not
easily
persuaded
to
dine
on
snails
with
an
italian
on
frogs
with
a
frenchman
or
on
horseflesh
with
a
tartar
the
vulgar
inhabitants
of
sky
i
know
not
whether
of
the
other
islands
have
not
only
eels
but
pork
and
bacon
in
abhorrence
and
accordingly
i
never
saw
a
hog
in
the
hebrides
except
one
at
dunvegan
raasay
has
wild
fowl
in
abundance
but
neither
deer
hares
nor
rabbits
why
it
has
them
not
might
be
asked
but
that
of
such
questions
there
is
no
end
why
does
any
nation
want
what
it
might
have
why
are
not
spices
transplanted
to
america
why
does
tea
continue
to
be
brought
from
china
life
improves
but
by
slow
degrees
and
much
in
every
place
is
yet
to
do
attempts
have
been
made
to
raise
roebucks
in
raasay
but
without
effect
the
young
ones
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
rear
and
the
old
can
very
seldom
be
taken
alive
hares
and
rabbits
might
be
more
easily
obtained
that
they
have
few
or
none
of
either
in
sky
they
impute
to
the
ravage
of
the
foxes
and
have
therefore
set
for
some
years
past
a
price
upon
their
heads
which
as
the
number
was
diminished
has
been
gradually
raised
from
three
shillings
and
sixpence
to
a
guinea
a
sum
so
great
in
this
part
of
the
world
that
in
a
short
time
sky
may
be
as
free
from
foxes
as
england
from
wolves
the
fund
for
these
rewards
is
a
tax
of
sixpence
in
the
pound
imposed
by
the
farmers
on
themselves
and
said
to
be
paid
with
great
willingness
the
beasts
of
prey
in
the
islands
are
foxes
otters
and
weasels
the
foxes
are
bigger
than
those
of
england
but
the
otters
exceed
ours
in
a
far
greater
proportion
i
saw
one
at
armidel
of
a
size
much
beyond
that
which
i
supposed
them
ever
to
attain
and
maclean
the
heir
of
col
a
man
of
middle
stature
informed
me
that
he
once
shot
an
otter
of
which
the
tail
reached
the
ground
when
he
held
up
the
head
to
a
level
with
his
own
i
expected
the
otter
to
have
a
foot
particularly
formed
for
the
art
of
swimming
but
upon
examination
i
did
not
find
it
differing
much
from
that
of
a
spaniel
as
he
preys
in
the
sea
he
does
little
visible
mischief
and
is
killed
only
for
his
fur
white
otters
are
sometimes
seen
in
raasay
they
might
have
hares
and
rabbits
for
they
have
no
foxes
some
depredations
such
as
were
never
made
before
have
caused
a
suspicion
that
a
fox
has
been
lately
landed
in
the
island
by
spite
or
wantonness
this
imaginary
stranger
has
never
yet
been
seen
and
therefore
perhaps
the
mischief
was
done
by
some
other
animal
it
is
not
likely
that
a
creature
so
ungentle
whose
head
could
have
been
sold
in
sky
for
a
guinea
should
be
kept
alive
only
to
gratify
the
malice
of
sending
him
to
prey
upon
a
neighbour
and
the
passage
from
sky
is
wider
than
a
fox
would
venture
to
swim
unless
he
were
chased
by
dogs
into
the
sea
and
perhaps
than
his
strength
would
enable
him
to
cross
how
beasts
of
prey
came
into
any
islands
is
not
easy
to
guess
in
cold
countries
they
take
advantage
of
hard
winters
and
travel
over
the
ice
but
this
is
a
very
scanty
solution
for
they
are
found
where
they
have
no
discoverable
means
of
coming
the
corn
of
this
island
is
but
little
i
saw
the
harvest
of
a
small
field
the
women
reaped
the
corn
and
the
men
bound
up
the
sheaves
the
strokes
of
the
sickle
were
timed
by
the
modulation
of
the
harvest
song
in
which
all
their
voices
were
united
they
accompany
in
the
highlands
every
action
which
can
be
done
in
equal
time
with
an
appropriated
strain
which
has
they
say
not
much
meaning
but
its
effects
are
regularity
and
cheerfulness
the
ancient
proceleusmatick
song
by
which
the
rowers
of
gallies
were
animated
may
be
supposed
to
have
been
of
this
kind
there
is
now
an
used
by
the
hebridians
the
ground
of
raasay
seems
fitter
for
cattle
than
for
corn
and
of
black
cattle
i
suppose
the
number
is
very
great
the
laird
himself
keeps
a
herd
of
four
hundred
one
hundred
of
which
are
annually
sold
of
an
extensive
domain
which
he
holds
in
his
own
hands
he
considers
the
sale
of
cattle
as
repaying
him
the
rent
and
supports
the
plenty
of
a
very
liberal
table
with
the
remaining
product
raasay
is
supposed
to
have
been
very
long
inhabited
on
one
side
of
it
they
show
caves
into
which
the
rude
nations
of
the
first
ages
retreated
from
the
weather
these
dreary
vaults
might
have
had
other
uses
there
is
still
a
cavity
near
the
house
called
the
in
which
the
seamen
after
one
of
those
piratical
expeditions
which
in
rougher
times
were
very
frequent
used
as
tradition
tells
to
hide
their
oars
this
hollow
was
near
the
sea
that
nothing
so
necessary
might
be
far
to
be
fetched
and
it
was
secret
that
enemies
if
they
landed
could
find
nothing
yet
it
is
not
very
evident
of
what
use
it
was
to
hide
their
oars
from
those
who
if
they
were
masters
of
the
coast
could
take
away
their
boats
a
proof
much
stronger
of
the
distance
at
which
the
first
possessors
of
this
island
lived
from
the
present
time
is
afforded
by
the
stone
heads
of
arrows
which
are
very
frequently
picked
up
the
people
call
them
bolts
and
believe
that
the
fairies
shoot
them
at
the
cattle
they
nearly
resemble
those
which
banks
has
lately
brought
from
the
savage
countries
in
the
pacifick
ocean
and
must
have
been
made
by
a
nation
to
which
the
use
of
metals
was
unknown
the
number
of
this
little
community
has
never
been
counted
by
its
ruler
nor
have
i
obtained
any
positive
account
consistent
with
the
result
of
political
computation
not
many
years
ago
the
late
laird
led
out
one
hundred
men
upon
a
military
expedition
the
sixth
part
of
a
people
is
supposed
capable
of
bearing
arms
raasay
had
therefore
six
hundred
inhabitants
but
because
it
is
not
likely
that
every
man
able
to
serve
in
the
field
would
follow
the
summons
or
that
the
chief
would
leave
his
lands
totally
defenceless
or
take
away
all
the
hands
qualified
for
labour
let
it
be
supposed
that
half
as
many
might
be
permitted
to
stay
at
home
the
whole
number
will
then
be
nine
hundred
or
nine
to
a
square
mile
a
degree
of
populousness
greater
than
those
tracts
of
desolation
can
often
show
they
are
content
with
their
country
and
faithful
to
their
chiefs
and
yet
uninfected
with
the
fever
of
migration
near
the
house
at
raasay
is
a
chapel
unroofed
and
ruinous
which
has
long
been
used
only
as
a
place
of
burial
about
the
churches
in
the
islands
are
small
squares
inclosed
with
stone
which
belong
to
particular
families
as
repositories
for
the
dead
at
raasay
there
is
one
i
think
for
the
proprietor
and
one
for
some
collateral
house
it
is
told
by
martin
that
at
the
death
of
the
lady
of
the
island
it
has
been
here
the
custom
to
erect
a
cross
this
we
found
not
to
be
true
the
stones
that
stand
about
the
chapel
at
a
small
distance
some
of
which
perhaps
have
crosses
cut
upon
them
are
believed
to
have
been
not
funeral
monuments
but
the
ancient
boundaries
of
the
sanctuary
or
consecrated
ground
martin
was
a
man
not
illiterate
he
was
an
inhabitant
of
sky
and
therefore
was
within
reach
of
intelligence
and
with
no
great
difficulty
might
have
visited
the
places
which
he
undertakes
to
describe
yet
with
all
his
opportunities
he
has
often
suffered
himself
to
be
deceived
he
lived
in
the
last
century
when
the
chiefs
of
the
clans
had
lost
little
of
their
original
influence
the
mountains
were
yet
unpenetrated
no
inlet
was
opened
to
foreign
novelties
and
the
feudal
institution
operated
upon
life
with
their
full
force
he
might
therefore
have
displayed
a
series
of
subordination
and
a
form
of
government
which
in
more
luminous
and
improved
regions
have
been
long
forgotten
and
have
delighted
his
readers
with
many
uncouth
customs
that
are
now
disused
and
wild
opinions
that
prevail
no
longer
but
he
probably
had
not
knowledge
of
the
world
sufficient
to
qualify
him
for
judging
what
would
deserve
or
gain
the
attention
of
mankind
the
mode
of
life
which
was
familiar
to
himself
he
did
not
suppose
unknown
to
others
nor
imagined
that
he
could
give
pleasure
by
telling
that
of
which
it
was
in
his
little
country
impossible
to
be
ignorant
what
he
has
neglected
can
not
now
be
performed
in
nations
where
there
is
hardly
the
use
of
letters
what
is
once
out
of
sight
is
lost
for
ever
they
think
but
little
and
of
their
few
thoughts
none
are
wasted
on
the
past
in
which
they
are
neither
interested
by
fear
nor
hope
their
only
registers
are
stated
observances
and
practical
representations
for
this
reason
an
age
of
ignorance
is
an
age
of
ceremony
pageants
and
processions
and
commemorations
gradually
shrink
away
as
better
methods
come
into
use
of
recording
events
and
preserving
rights
it
is
not
only
in
raasay
that
the
chapel
is
unroofed
and
useless
through
the
few
islands
which
we
visited
we
neither
saw
nor
heard
of
any
house
of
prayer
except
in
sky
that
was
not
in
ruins
the
malignant
influence
of
calvinism
has
blasted
ceremony
and
decency
together
and
if
the
remembrance
of
papal
superstition
is
obliterated
the
monuments
of
papal
piety
are
likewise
effaced
it
has
been
for
many
years
popular
to
talk
of
the
lazy
devotion
of
the
romish
clergy
over
the
sleepy
laziness
of
men
that
erected
churches
we
may
indulge
our
superiority
with
a
new
triumph
by
comparing
it
with
the
fervid
activity
of
those
who
suffer
them
to
fall
of
the
destruction
of
churches
the
decay
of
religion
must
in
time
be
the
consequence
for
while
the
publick
acts
of
the
ministry
are
now
performed
in
houses
a
very
small
number
can
be
present
and
as
the
greater
part
of
the
islanders
make
no
use
of
books
all
must
necessarily
live
in
total
ignorance
who
want
the
opportunity
of
vocal
instruction
from
these
remains
of
ancient
sanctity
which
are
every
where
to
be
found
it
has
been
conjectured
that
for
the
last
two
centuries
the
inhabitants
of
the
islands
have
decreased
in
number
this
argument
which
supposes
that
the
churches
have
been
suffered
to
fall
only
because
they
were
no
longer
necessary
would
have
some
force
if
the
houses
of
worship
still
remaining
were
sufficient
for
the
people
but
since
they
have
now
no
churches
at
all
these
venerable
fragments
do
not
prove
the
people
of
former
times
to
have
been
more
numerous
but
to
have
been
more
devout
if
the
inhabitants
were
doubled
with
their
present
principles
it
appears
not
that
any
provision
for
publick
worship
would
be
made
where
the
religion
of
a
country
enforces
consecrated
buildings
the
number
of
those
buildings
may
be
supposed
to
afford
some
indication
however
uncertain
of
the
populousness
of
the
place
but
where
by
a
change
of
manners
a
nation
is
contented
to
live
without
them
their
decay
implies
no
diminution
of
inhabitants
some
of
these
dilapidations
are
said
to
be
found
in
islands
now
uninhabited
but
i
doubt
whether
we
can
thence
infer
that
they
were
ever
peopled
the
religion
of
the
middle
age
is
well
known
to
have
placed
too
much
hope
in
lonely
austerities
voluntary
solitude
was
the
great
act
of
propitiation
by
which
crimes
were
effaced
and
conscience
was
appeased
it
is
therefore
not
unlikely
that
oratories
were
often
built
in
places
where
retirement
was
sure
to
have
no
disturbance
raasay
has
little
that
can
detain
a
traveller
except
the
laird
and
his
family
but
their
power
wants
no
auxiliaries
such
a
seat
of
hospitality
amidst
the
winds
and
waters
fills
the
imagination
with
a
delightful
contrariety
of
images
without
is
the
rough
ocean
and
the
rocky
land
the
beating
billows
and
the
howling
storm
within
is
plenty
and
elegance
beauty
and
gaiety
the
song
and
the
dance
in
raasay
if
i
could
have
found
an
ulysses
i
had
fancied
a
phoeacia
dunvegan
at
raasay
by
good
fortune
macleod
so
the
chief
of
the
clan
is
called
was
paying
a
visit
and
by
him
we
were
invited
to
his
seat
at
dunvegan
raasay
has
a
stout
boat
built
in
norway
in
which
with
six
oars
he
conveyed
us
back
to
sky
we
landed
at
port
re
so
called
because
james
the
fifth
of
scotland
who
had
curiosity
to
visit
the
islands
came
into
it
the
port
is
made
by
an
inlet
of
the
sea
deep
and
narrow
where
a
ship
lay
waiting
to
dispeople
sky
by
carrying
the
natives
away
to
america
in
coasting
sky
we
passed
by
the
cavern
in
which
it
was
the
custom
as
martin
relates
to
catch
birds
in
the
night
by
making
a
fire
at
the
entrance
this
practice
is
disused
for
the
birds
as
is
known
often
to
happen
have
changed
their
haunts
here
we
dined
at
a
publick
house
i
believe
the
only
inn
of
the
island
and
having
mounted
our
horses
travelled
in
the
manner
already
described
till
we
came
to
kingsborough
a
place
distinguished
by
that
name
because
the
king
lodged
here
when
he
landed
at
port
re
we
were
entertained
with
the
usual
hospitality
by
macdonald
and
his
lady
flora
macdonald
a
name
that
will
be
mentioned
in
history
and
if
courage
and
fidelity
be
virtues
mentioned
with
honour
she
is
a
woman
of
middle
stature
soft
features
gentle
manners
and
elegant
presence
in
the
morning
we
sent
our
horses
round
a
promontory
to
meet
us
and
spared
ourselves
part
of
the
day
fatigue
by
crossing
an
arm
of
the
sea
we
had
at
last
some
difficulty
in
coming
to
dunvegan
for
our
way
led
over
an
extensive
moor
where
every
step
was
to
be
taken
with
caution
and
we
were
often
obliged
to
alight
because
the
ground
could
not
be
trusted
in
travelling
this
watery
flat
i
perceived
that
it
had
a
visible
declivity
and
might
without
much
expence
or
difficulty
be
drained
but
difficulty
and
expence
are
relative
terms
which
have
different
meanings
in
different
places
to
dunvegan
we
came
very
willing
to
be
at
rest
and
found
our
fatigue
amply
recompensed
by
our
reception
lady
macleod
who
had
lived
many
years
in
england
was
newly
come
hither
with
her
son
and
four
daughters
who
knew
all
the
arts
of
southern
elegance
and
all
the
modes
of
english
economy
here
therefore
we
settled
and
did
not
spoil
the
present
hour
with
thoughts
of
departure
dunvegan
is
a
rocky
prominence
that
juts
out
into
a
bay
on
the
west
side
of
sky
the
house
which
is
the
principal
seat
of
macleod
is
partly
old
and
partly
modern
it
is
built
upon
the
rock
and
looks
upon
the
water
it
forms
two
sides
of
a
small
square
on
the
third
side
is
the
skeleton
of
a
castle
of
unknown
antiquity
supposed
to
have
been
a
norwegian
fortress
when
the
danes
were
masters
of
the
islands
it
is
so
nearly
entire
that
it
might
have
easily
been
made
habitable
were
there
not
an
ominous
tradition
in
the
family
that
the
owner
shall
not
long
outlive
the
reparation
the
grandfather
of
the
present
laird
in
defiance
of
prediction
began
the
work
but
desisted
in
a
little
time
and
applied
his
money
to
worse
uses
as
the
inhabitants
of
the
hebrides
lived
for
many
ages
in
continual
expectation
of
hostilities
the
chief
of
every
clan
resided
in
a
fortress
this
house
was
accessible
only
from
the
water
till
the
last
possessor
opened
an
entrance
by
stairs
upon
the
land
they
had
formerly
reason
to
be
afraid
not
only
of
declared
wars
and
authorized
invaders
or
of
roving
pirates
which
in
the
northern
seas
must
have
been
very
common
but
of
inroads
and
insults
from
rival
clans
who
in
the
plenitude
of
feudal
independence
asked
no
leave
of
their
sovereign
to
make
war
on
one
another
sky
has
been
ravaged
by
a
feud
between
the
two
mighty
powers
of
macdonald
and
macleod
macdonald
having
married
a
macleod
upon
some
discontent
dismissed
her
perhaps
because
she
had
brought
him
no
children
before
the
reign
of
james
the
fifth
a
highland
laird
made
a
trial
of
his
wife
for
a
certain
time
and
if
she
did
not
please
him
he
was
then
at
liberty
to
send
her
away
this
however
must
always
have
offended
and
macleod
resenting
the
injury
whatever
were
its
circumstances
declared
that
the
wedding
had
been
solemnized
without
a
bonfire
but
that
the
separation
should
be
better
illuminated
and
raising
a
little
army
set
fire
to
the
territories
of
macdonald
who
returned
the
visit
and
prevailed
another
story
may
show
the
disorderly
state
of
insular
neighbourhood
the
inhabitants
of
the
isle
of
egg
meeting
a
boat
manned
by
macleods
tied
the
crew
hand
and
foot
and
set
them
macleod
landed
upon
egg
and
demanded
the
offenders
but
the
inhabitants
refusing
to
surrender
them
retreated
to
a
cavern
into
which
they
thought
their
enemies
unlikely
to
follow
them
macleod
choked
them
with
smoke
and
left
them
lying
dead
by
families
as
they
stood
here
the
violence
of
the
weather
confined
us
for
some
time
not
at
all
to
our
discontent
or
inconvenience
we
would
indeed
very
willingly
have
visited
the
islands
which
might
be
seen
from
the
house
scattered
in
the
sea
and
i
was
particularly
desirous
to
have
viewed
isay
but
the
storms
did
not
permit
us
to
launch
a
boat
and
we
were
condemned
to
listen
in
idleness
to
the
wind
except
when
we
were
better
engaged
by
listening
to
the
ladies
we
had
here
more
wind
than
waves
and
suffered
the
severity
of
a
tempest
without
enjoying
its
magnificence
the
sea
being
broken
by
the
multitude
of
islands
does
not
roar
with
so
much
noise
nor
beat
the
shore
with
such
foamy
violence
as
i
have
remarked
on
the
coast
of
sussex
though
while
i
was
in
the
hebrides
the
wind
was
extremely
turbulent
i
never
saw
very
high
billows
the
country
about
dunvegan
is
rough
and
barren
there
are
no
trees
except
in
the
orchard
which
is
a
low
sheltered
spot
surrounded
with
a
wall
when
this
house
was
intended
to
sustain
a
siege
a
well
was
made
in
the
court
by
boring
the
rock
downwards
till
water
was
found
which
though
so
near
to
the
sea
i
have
not
heard
mentioned
as
brackish
though
it
has
some
hardness
or
other
qualities
which
make
it
less
fit
for
use
and
the
family
is
now
better
supplied
from
a
stream
which
runs
by
the
rock
from
two
pleasing
waterfalls
here
we
saw
some
traces
of
former
manners
and
heard
some
standing
traditions
in
the
house
is
kept
an
ox
horn
hollowed
so
as
to
hold
perhaps
two
quarts
which
the
heir
of
macleod
was
expected
to
swallow
at
one
draught
as
a
test
of
his
manhood
before
he
was
permitted
to
bear
arms
or
could
claim
a
seat
among
the
men
it
is
held
that
the
return
of
the
laird
to
dunvegan
after
any
considerable
absence
produces
a
plentiful
capture
of
herrings
and
that
if
any
woman
crosses
the
water
to
the
opposite
island
the
herrings
will
desert
the
coast
boetius
tells
the
same
of
some
other
place
this
tradition
is
not
uniform
some
hold
that
no
woman
may
pass
and
others
that
none
may
pass
but
a
macleod
among
other
guests
which
the
hospitality
of
dunvegan
brought
to
the
table
a
visit
was
paid
by
the
laird
and
lady
of
a
small
island
south
of
sky
of
which
the
proper
name
is
muack
which
signifies
swine
it
is
commonly
called
muck
which
the
proprietor
not
liking
has
endeavoured
without
effect
to
change
to
monk
it
is
usual
to
call
gentlemen
in
scotland
by
the
name
of
their
possessions
as
raasay
bernera
loch
buy
a
practice
necessary
in
countries
inhabited
by
clans
where
all
that
live
in
the
same
territory
have
one
name
and
must
be
therefore
discriminated
by
some
addition
this
gentleman
whose
name
i
think
is
maclean
should
be
regularly
called
muck
but
the
appellation
which
he
thinks
too
coarse
for
his
island
he
would
like
still
less
for
himself
and
he
is
therefore
addressed
by
the
title
of
isle
of
muck
this
little
island
however
it
be
named
is
of
considerable
value
it
is
two
english
miles
long
and
three
quarters
of
a
mile
broad
and
consequently
contains
only
nine
hundred
and
sixty
english
acres
it
is
chiefly
arable
half
of
this
little
dominion
the
laird
retains
in
his
own
hand
and
on
the
other
half
live
one
hundred
and
sixty
persons
who
pay
their
rent
by
exported
corn
what
rent
they
pay
we
were
not
told
and
could
not
decently
inquire
the
proportion
of
the
people
to
the
land
is
such
as
the
most
fertile
countries
do
not
commonly
maintain
the
laird
having
all
his
people
under
his
immediate
view
seems
to
be
very
attentive
to
their
happiness
the
devastation
of
the
when
it
visits
places
where
it
comes
seldom
is
well
known
he
has
disarmed
it
of
its
terrour
at
muack
by
inoculating
eighty
of
his
people
the
expence
was
two
shillings
and
sixpence
a
head
many
trades
they
can
not
have
among
them
but
upon
occasion
he
fetches
a
smith
from
the
isle
of
egg
and
has
a
tailor
from
the
main
land
six
times
a
year
this
island
well
deserved
to
be
seen
but
the
laird
absence
left
us
no
opportunity
every
inhabited
island
has
its
appendant
and
subordinate
islets
muck
however
small
has
yet
others
smaller
about
it
one
of
which
has
only
ground
sufficient
to
afford
pasture
for
three
wethers
at
dunvegan
i
had
tasted
lotus
and
was
in
danger
of
forgetting
that
i
was
ever
to
depart
till
boswell
sagely
reproached
me
with
my
sluggishness
and
softness
i
had
no
very
forcible
defence
to
make
and
we
agreed
to
pursue
our
journey
macleod
accompanied
us
to
ulinish
where
we
were
entertained
by
the
sheriff
of
the
island
ulinish
macqueen
travelled
with
us
and
directed
our
attention
to
all
that
was
worthy
of
observation
with
him
we
went
to
see
an
ancient
building
called
a
dun
or
borough
it
was
a
circular
inclosure
about
feet
in
diameter
walled
round
with
loose
stones
perhaps
to
the
height
of
nine
feet
the
walls
were
very
thick
diminishing
a
little
toward
the
top
and
though
in
these
countries
stone
is
not
brought
far
must
have
been
raised
with
much
labour
within
the
great
circle
were
several
smaller
rounds
of
wall
which
formed
distinct
apartments
its
date
and
its
use
are
unknown
some
suppose
it
the
original
seat
of
the
chiefs
of
the
macleods
macqueen
thought
it
a
danish
fort
the
entrance
is
covered
with
flat
stones
and
is
narrow
because
it
was
necessary
that
the
stones
which
lie
over
it
should
reach
from
one
wall
to
the
other
yet
strait
as
the
passage
is
they
seem
heavier
than
could
have
been
placed
where
they
now
lie
by
the
naked
strength
of
as
many
men
as
might
stand
about
them
they
were
probably
raised
by
putting
long
pieces
of
wood
under
them
to
which
the
action
of
a
long
line
of
lifters
might
be
applied
savages
in
all
countries
have
patience
proportionate
to
their
unskilfulness
and
are
content
to
attain
their
end
by
very
tedious
methods
if
it
was
ever
roofed
it
might
once
have
been
a
dwelling
but
as
there
is
no
provision
for
water
it
could
not
have
been
a
fortress
in
sky
as
in
every
other
place
there
is
an
ambition
of
exalting
whatever
has
survived
memory
to
some
important
use
and
referring
it
to
very
remote
ages
i
am
inclined
to
suspect
that
in
lawless
times
when
the
inhabitants
of
every
mountain
stole
the
cattle
of
their
neighbour
these
inclosures
were
used
to
secure
the
herds
and
flocks
in
the
night
when
they
were
driven
within
the
wall
they
might
be
easily
watched
and
defended
as
long
as
could
be
needful
for
the
robbers
durst
not
wait
till
the
injured
clan
should
find
them
in
the
morning
the
interior
inclosures
if
the
whole
building
were
once
a
house
were
the
chambers
of
the
chief
inhabitants
if
it
was
a
place
of
security
for
cattle
they
were
probably
the
shelters
of
the
keepers
from
the
dun
we
were
conducted
to
another
place
of
security
a
cave
carried
a
great
way
under
ground
which
had
been
discovered
by
digging
after
a
fox
these
caves
of
which
many
have
been
found
and
many
probably
remain
concealed
are
formed
i
believe
commonly
by
taking
advantage
of
a
hollow
where
banks
or
rocks
rise
on
either
side
if
no
such
place
can
be
found
the
ground
must
be
cut
away
the
walls
are
made
by
piling
stones
against
the
earth
on
either
side
it
is
then
roofed
by
larger
stones
laid
across
the
cavern
which
therefore
can
not
be
wide
over
the
roof
turfs
were
placed
and
grass
was
suffered
to
grow
and
the
mouth
was
concealed
by
bushes
or
some
other
cover
these
caves
were
represented
to
us
as
the
cabins
of
the
first
rude
inhabitants
of
which
however
i
am
by
no
means
persuaded
this
was
so
low
that
no
man
could
stand
upright
in
it
by
their
construction
they
are
all
so
narrow
that
two
can
never
pass
along
them
together
and
being
subterraneous
they
must
be
always
damp
they
are
not
the
work
of
an
age
much
ruder
than
the
present
for
they
are
formed
with
as
much
art
as
the
construction
of
a
common
hut
requires
i
imagine
them
to
have
been
places
only
of
occasional
use
in
which
the
islander
upon
a
sudden
alarm
hid
his
utensils
or
his
cloaths
and
perhaps
sometimes
his
wife
and
children
this
cave
we
entered
but
could
not
proceed
the
whole
length
and
went
away
without
knowing
how
far
it
was
carried
for
this
omission
we
shall
be
blamed
as
we
perhaps
have
blamed
other
travellers
but
the
day
was
rainy
and
the
ground
was
damp
we
had
with
us
neither
spades
nor
pickaxes
and
if
love
of
ease
surmounted
our
desire
of
knowledge
the
offence
has
not
the
invidiousness
of
singularity
edifices
either
standing
or
ruined
are
the
chief
records
of
an
illiterate
nation
in
some
part
of
this
journey
at
no
great
distance
from
our
way
stood
a
shattered
fortress
of
which
the
learned
minister
to
whose
communication
we
are
much
indebted
gave
us
an
account
those
said
he
are
the
walls
of
a
place
of
refuge
built
in
the
time
of
james
the
sixth
by
hugh
macdonald
who
was
next
heir
to
the
dignity
and
fortune
of
his
chief
hugh
being
so
near
his
wish
was
impatient
of
delay
and
had
art
and
influence
sufficient
to
engage
several
gentlemen
in
a
plot
against
the
laird
life
something
must
be
stipulated
on
both
sides
for
they
would
not
dip
their
hands
in
blood
merely
for
advancement
the
compact
was
formerly
written
signed
by
the
conspirators
and
placed
in
the
hands
of
one
macleod
it
happened
that
macleod
had
sold
some
cattle
to
a
drover
who
not
having
ready
money
gave
him
a
bond
for
payment
the
debt
was
discharged
and
the
bond
which
macleod
who
could
not
read
intending
to
put
into
his
hands
gave
him
the
conspiracy
the
drover
when
he
had
read
the
paper
delivered
it
privately
to
macdonald
who
being
thus
informed
of
his
danger
called
his
friends
together
and
provided
for
his
safety
he
made
a
public
feast
and
inviting
hugh
macdonald
and
his
confederates
placed
each
of
them
at
the
table
between
two
men
of
known
fidelity
the
compact
of
conspiracy
was
then
shewn
and
every
man
confronted
with
his
own
name
macdonald
acted
with
great
moderation
he
upbraided
hugh
both
with
disloyalty
and
ingratitude
but
told
the
rest
that
he
considered
them
as
men
deluded
and
misinformed
hugh
was
sworn
to
fidelity
and
dismissed
with
his
companions
but
he
was
not
generous
enough
to
be
reclaimed
by
lenity
and
finding
no
longer
any
countenance
among
the
gentlemen
endeavoured
to
execute
the
same
design
by
meaner
hands
in
this
practice
he
was
detected
taken
to
castle
and
imprisoned
in
the
dungeon
when
he
was
hungry
they
let
down
a
plentiful
meal
of
salted
meat
and
when
after
his
repast
he
called
for
drink
conveyed
to
him
a
covered
cup
which
when
he
lifted
the
lid
he
found
empty
from
that
time
they
visited
him
no
more
but
left
him
to
perish
in
solitude
and
darkness
we
were
then
told
of
a
cavern
by
the
remarkable
for
the
powerful
reverberation
of
sounds
after
dinner
we
took
a
boat
to
explore
this
curious
cavity
the
boatmen
who
seemed
to
be
of
a
rank
above
that
of
common
drudges
inquired
who
the
strangers
were
and
being
told
we
came
one
from
scotland
and
the
other
from
england
asked
if
the
englishman
could
recount
a
long
genealogy
what
answer
was
given
them
the
conversation
being
in
erse
i
was
not
much
inclined
to
examine
they
expected
no
good
event
of
the
voyage
for
one
of
them
declared
that
he
heard
the
cry
of
an
english
ghost
this
omen
i
was
not
told
till
after
our
return
and
therefore
can
not
claim
the
dignity
of
despising
it
the
sea
was
smooth
we
never
left
the
shore
and
came
without
any
disaster
to
the
cavern
which
we
found
rugged
and
misshapen
about
one
hundred
and
eighty
feet
long
thirty
wide
in
the
broadest
part
and
in
the
loftiest
as
we
guessed
about
thirty
high
it
was
now
dry
but
at
high
water
the
sea
rises
in
it
near
six
feet
here
i
saw
what
i
had
never
seen
before
limpets
and
mussels
in
their
natural
state
but
as
a
new
testimony
to
the
veracity
of
common
fame
here
was
no
echo
to
be
heard
we
then
walked
through
a
natural
arch
in
the
rock
which
might
have
pleased
us
by
its
novelty
had
the
stones
which
incumbered
our
feet
given
us
leisure
to
consider
it
we
were
shown
the
gummy
seed
of
the
kelp
that
fastens
itself
to
a
stone
from
which
it
grows
into
a
strong
stalk
in
our
return
we
found
a
little
boy
upon
the
point
of
rock
catching
with
his
angle
a
supper
for
the
family
we
rowed
up
to
him
and
borrowed
his
rod
with
which
boswell
caught
a
cuddy
the
cuddy
is
a
fish
of
which
i
know
not
the
philosophical
name
it
is
not
much
bigger
than
a
gudgeon
but
is
of
great
use
in
these
islands
as
it
affords
the
lower
people
both
food
and
oil
for
their
lamps
cuddies
are
so
abundant
at
sometimes
of
the
year
that
they
are
caught
like
whitebait
in
the
thames
only
by
dipping
a
basket
and
drawing
it
back
if
it
were
always
practicable
to
fish
these
islands
could
never
be
in
much
danger
from
famine
but
unhappily
in
the
winter
when
other
provision
fails
the
seas
are
commonly
too
rough
for
nets
or
boats
talisker
in
sky
from
ulinish
our
next
stage
was
to
talisker
the
house
of
colonel
macleod
an
officer
in
the
dutch
service
who
in
this
time
of
universal
peace
has
for
several
years
been
permitted
to
be
absent
from
his
regiment
having
been
bred
to
physick
he
is
consequently
a
scholar
and
his
lady
by
accompanying
him
in
his
different
places
of
residence
is
become
skilful
in
several
languages
talisker
is
the
place
beyond
all
that
i
have
seen
from
which
the
gay
and
the
jovial
seem
utterly
excluded
and
where
the
hermit
might
expect
to
grow
old
in
meditation
without
possibility
of
disturbance
or
interruption
it
is
situated
very
near
the
sea
but
upon
a
coast
where
no
vessel
lands
but
when
it
is
driven
by
a
tempest
on
the
rocks
towards
the
land
are
lofty
hills
streaming
with
waterfalls
the
garden
is
sheltered
by
firs
or
pines
which
grow
there
so
prosperously
that
some
which
the
present
inhabitant
planted
are
very
high
and
thick
at
this
place
we
very
happily
met
donald
maclean
a
young
gentleman
the
eldest
son
of
the
laird
of
col
heir
to
a
very
great
extent
of
land
and
so
desirous
of
improving
his
inheritance
that
he
spent
a
considerable
time
among
the
farmers
of
hertfordshire
and
hampshire
to
learn
their
practice
he
worked
with
his
own
hands
at
the
principal
operations
of
agriculture
that
he
might
not
deceive
himself
by
a
false
opinion
of
skill
which
if
he
should
find
it
deficient
at
home
he
had
no
means
of
completing
if
the
world
has
agreed
to
praise
the
travels
and
manual
labours
of
the
czar
of
muscovy
let
col
have
his
share
of
the
like
applause
in
the
proportion
of
his
dominions
to
the
empire
of
russia
this
young
gentleman
was
sporting
in
the
mountains
of
sky
and
when
he
was
weary
with
following
his
game
repaired
for
lodging
to
talisker
at
night
he
missed
one
of
his
dogs
and
when
he
went
to
seek
him
in
the
morning
found
two
eagles
feeding
on
his
carcass
col
for
he
must
be
named
by
his
possessions
hearing
that
our
intention
was
to
visit
jona
offered
to
conduct
us
to
his
chief
sir
allan
maclean
who
lived
in
the
isle
of
inch
kenneth
and
would
readily
find
us
a
convenient
passage
from
this
time
was
formed
an
acquaintance
which
being
begun
by
kindness
was
accidentally
continued
by
constraint
we
derived
much
pleasure
from
it
and
i
hope
have
given
him
no
reason
to
repent
it
the
weather
was
now
almost
one
continued
storm
and
we
were
to
snatch
some
happy
intermission
to
be
conveyed
to
mull
the
third
island
of
the
hebrides
lying
about
a
degree
south
of
sky
whence
we
might
easily
find
our
way
to
inch
kenneth
where
sir
allan
maclean
resided
and
afterward
to
jona
for
this
purpose
the
most
commodious
station
that
we
could
take
was
armidel
which
sir
alexander
macdonald
had
now
left
to
a
gentleman
who
lived
there
as
his
factor
or
steward
in
our
way
to
armidel
was
coriatachan
where
we
had
already
been
and
to
which
therefore
we
were
very
willing
to
return
we
staid
however
so
long
at
talisker
that
a
great
part
of
our
journey
was
performed
in
the
gloom
of
the
evening
in
travelling
even
thus
almost
without
light
thro
naked
solitude
when
there
is
a
guide
whose
conduct
may
be
trusted
a
mind
not
naturally
too
much
disposed
to
fear
may
preserve
some
degree
of
cheerfulness
but
what
must
be
the
solicitude
of
him
who
should
be
wandering
among
the
craggs
and
hollows
benighted
ignorant
and
alone
the
fictions
of
the
gothick
romances
were
not
so
remote
from
credibility
as
they
are
now
thought
in
the
full
prevalence
of
the
feudal
institution
when
violence
desolated
the
world
and
every
baron
lived
in
a
fortress
forests
and
castles
were
regularly
succeeded
by
each
other
and
the
adventurer
might
very
suddenly
pass
from
the
gloom
of
woods
or
the
ruggedness
of
moors
to
seats
of
plenty
gaiety
and
magnificence
whatever
is
imaged
in
the
wildest
tale
if
giants
dragons
and
enchantment
be
excepted
would
be
felt
by
him
who
wandering
in
the
mountains
without
a
guide
or
upon
the
sea
without
a
pilot
should
be
carried
amidst
his
terror
and
uncertainty
to
the
hospitality
and
elegance
of
raasay
or
dunvegan
to
coriatachan
at
last
we
came
and
found
ourselves
welcomed
as
before
here
we
staid
two
days
and
made
such
inquiries
as
curiosity
suggested
the
house
was
filled
with
company
among
whom
macpherson
and
his
sister
distinguished
themselves
by
their
politeness
and
accomplishments
by
him
we
were
invited
to
ostig
a
house
not
far
from
armidel
where
we
might
easily
hear
of
a
boat
when
the
weather
would
suffer
us
to
leave
the
island
ostig
in
sky
at
ostig
of
which
macpherson
is
minister
we
were
entertained
for
some
days
then
removed
to
armidel
where
we
finished
our
observations
on
the
island
of
sky
as
this
island
lies
in
the
degree
the
air
can
not
be
supposed
to
have
much
warmth
the
long
continuance
of
the
sun
above
the
horizon
does
indeed
sometimes
produce
great
heat
in
northern
latitudes
but
this
can
only
happen
in
sheltered
places
where
the
atmosphere
is
to
a
certain
degree
stagnant
and
the
same
mass
of
air
continues
to
receive
for
many
hours
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
the
vapours
of
the
earth
sky
lies
open
on
the
west
and
north
to
a
vast
extent
of
ocean
and
is
cooled
in
the
summer
by
perpetual
ventilation
but
by
the
same
blasts
is
kept
warm
in
winter
their
weather
is
not
pleasing
half
the
year
is
deluged
with
rain
from
the
autumnal
to
the
vernal
equinox
a
dry
day
is
hardly
known
except
when
the
showers
are
suspended
by
a
tempest
under
such
skies
can
be
expected
no
great
exuberance
of
vegetation
their
winter
overtakes
their
summer
and
their
harvest
lies
upon
the
ground
drenched
with
rain
the
autumn
struggles
hard
to
produce
some
of
our
early
fruits
i
gathered
gooseberries
in
september
but
they
were
small
and
the
husk
was
thick
their
winter
is
seldom
such
as
puts
a
full
stop
to
the
growth
of
plants
or
reduces
the
cattle
to
live
wholly
on
the
surplusage
of
the
summer
in
the
year
they
had
a
severe
season
remembered
by
the
name
of
the
black
spring
from
which
the
island
has
not
yet
recovered
the
snow
lay
long
upon
the
ground
a
calamity
hardly
known
before
part
of
their
cattle
died
for
want
part
were
unseasonably
sold
to
buy
sustenance
for
the
owners
and
what
i
have
not
read
or
heard
of
before
the
kine
that
survived
were
so
emaciated
and
dispirited
that
they
did
not
require
the
male
at
the
usual
time
many
of
the
roebucks
perished
the
soil
as
in
other
countries
has
its
diversities
in
some
parts
there
is
only
a
thin
layer
of
earth
spread
upon
a
rock
which
bears
nothing
but
short
brown
heath
and
perhaps
is
not
generally
capable
of
any
better
product
there
are
many
bogs
or
mosses
of
greater
or
less
extent
where
the
soil
can
not
be
supposed
to
want
depth
though
it
is
too
wet
for
the
plow
but
we
did
not
observe
in
these
any
aquatick
plants
the
vallies
and
the
mountains
are
alike
darkened
with
heath
some
grass
however
grows
here
and
there
and
some
happier
spots
of
earth
are
capable
of
tillage
their
agriculture
is
laborious
and
perhaps
rather
feeble
than
unskilful
their
chief
manure
is
seaweed
which
when
they
lay
it
to
rot
upon
the
field
gives
them
a
better
crop
than
those
of
the
highlands
they
heap
sea
shells
upon
the
dunghill
which
in
time
moulder
into
a
fertilising
substance
when
they
find
a
vein
of
earth
where
they
can
not
use
it
they
dig
it
up
and
add
it
to
the
mould
of
a
more
commodious
place
their
corn
grounds
often
lie
in
such
intricacies
among
the
craggs
that
there
is
no
room
for
the
action
of
a
team
and
plow
the
soil
is
then
turned
up
by
manual
labour
with
an
instrument
called
a
crooked
spade
of
a
form
and
weight
which
to
me
appeared
very
incommodious
and
would
perhaps
be
soon
improved
in
a
country
where
workmen
could
be
easily
found
and
easily
paid
it
has
a
narrow
blade
of
iron
fixed
to
a
long
and
heavy
piece
of
wood
which
must
have
about
a
foot
and
a
half
above
the
iron
a
knee
or
flexure
with
the
angle
downwards
when
the
farmer
encounters
a
stone
which
is
the
great
impediment
of
his
operations
he
drives
the
blade
under
it
and
bringing
the
knee
or
angle
to
the
ground
has
in
the
long
handle
a
very
forcible
lever
according
to
the
different
mode
of
tillage
farms
are
distinguished
into
long
land
and
short
land
long
land
is
that
which
affords
room
for
a
plow
and
short
land
is
turned
up
by
the
spade
the
grain
which
they
commit
to
the
furrows
thus
tediously
formed
is
either
oats
or
barley
they
do
not
sow
barley
without
very
copious
manure
and
then
they
expect
from
it
ten
for
one
an
increase
equal
to
that
of
better
countries
but
the
culture
is
so
operose
that
they
content
themselves
commonly
with
oats
and
who
can
relate
without
compassion
that
after
all
their
diligence
they
are
to
expect
only
a
triple
increase
it
is
in
vain
to
hope
for
plenty
when
a
third
part
of
the
harvest
must
be
reserved
for
seed
when
their
grain
is
arrived
at
the
state
which
they
must
consider
as
ripeness
they
do
not
cut
but
pull
the
barley
to
the
oats
they
apply
the
sickle
wheel
carriages
they
have
none
but
make
a
frame
of
timber
which
is
drawn
by
one
horse
with
the
two
points
behind
pressing
on
the
ground
on
this
they
sometimes
drag
home
their
sheaves
but
often
convey
them
home
in
a
kind
of
open
panier
or
frame
of
sticks
upon
the
back
of
that
which
is
obtained
with
so
much
difficulty
nothing
surely
ought
to
be
wasted
yet
their
method
of
clearing
their
oats
from
the
husk
is
by
parching
them
in
the
straw
thus
with
the
genuine
improvidence
of
savages
they
destroy
that
fodder
for
want
of
which
their
cattle
may
perish
from
this
practice
they
have
two
petty
conveniences
they
dry
the
grain
so
that
it
is
easily
reduced
to
meal
and
they
escape
the
theft
of
the
thresher
the
taste
contracted
from
the
fire
by
the
oats
as
by
every
other
scorched
substance
use
must
long
ago
have
made
grateful
the
oats
that
are
not
parched
must
be
dried
in
a
kiln
the
barns
of
sky
i
never
saw
that
which
macleod
of
raasay
had
erected
near
his
house
was
so
contrived
because
the
harvest
is
seldom
brought
home
dry
as
by
perpetual
perflation
to
prevent
the
mow
from
heating
of
their
gardens
i
can
judge
only
from
their
tables
i
did
not
observe
that
the
common
greens
were
wanting
and
suppose
that
by
choosing
an
advantageous
exposition
they
can
raise
all
the
more
hardy
esculent
plants
of
vegetable
fragrance
or
beauty
they
are
not
yet
studious
few
vows
are
made
to
flora
in
the
hebrides
they
gather
a
little
hay
but
the
grass
is
mown
late
and
is
so
often
almost
dry
and
again
very
wet
before
it
is
housed
that
it
becomes
a
collection
of
withered
stalks
without
taste
or
fragrance
it
must
be
eaten
by
cattle
that
have
nothing
else
but
by
most
english
farmers
would
be
thrown
away
in
the
islands
i
have
not
heard
that
any
subterraneous
treasures
have
been
discovered
though
where
there
are
mountains
there
are
commonly
minerals
one
of
the
rocks
in
col
has
a
black
vein
imagined
to
consist
of
the
ore
of
lead
but
it
was
never
yet
opened
or
essayed
in
sky
a
black
mass
was
accidentally
picked
up
and
brought
into
the
house
of
the
owner
of
the
land
who
found
himself
strongly
inclined
to
think
it
a
coal
but
unhappily
it
did
not
burn
in
the
chimney
common
ores
would
be
here
of
no
great
value
for
what
requires
to
be
separated
by
fire
must
if
it
were
found
be
carried
away
in
its
mineral
state
here
being
no
fewel
for
the
or
forge
perhaps
by
diligent
search
in
this
world
of
stone
some
valuable
species
of
marble
might
be
discovered
but
neither
philosophical
curiosity
nor
commercial
industry
have
yet
fixed
their
abode
here
where
the
importunity
of
immediate
want
supplied
but
for
the
day
and
craving
on
the
morrow
has
left
little
room
for
excursive
knowledge
or
the
pleasing
fancies
of
distant
profit
they
have
lately
found
a
manufacture
considerably
lucrative
their
rocks
abound
with
kelp
a
of
which
the
ashes
are
melted
into
glass
they
burn
kelp
in
great
quantities
and
then
send
it
away
in
ships
which
come
regularly
to
purchase
them
this
new
source
of
riches
has
raised
the
rents
of
many
maritime
farms
but
the
tenants
pay
like
all
other
tenants
the
additional
rent
with
great
unwillingness
because
they
consider
the
profits
of
the
kelp
as
the
mere
product
of
personal
labour
to
which
the
landlord
contributes
nothing
however
as
any
man
may
be
said
to
give
what
he
gives
the
power
of
gaining
he
has
certainly
as
much
right
to
profit
from
the
price
of
kelp
as
of
any
thing
else
found
or
raised
upon
his
ground
this
new
trade
has
excited
a
long
and
eager
litigation
between
macdonald
and
macleod
for
a
ledge
of
rocks
which
till
the
value
of
kelp
was
known
neither
of
them
desired
the
reputation
of
possessing
the
cattle
of
sky
are
not
so
small
as
is
commonly
believed
since
they
have
sent
their
beeves
in
great
numbers
to
southern
marts
they
have
probably
taken
more
care
of
their
breed
at
stated
times
the
annual
growth
of
cattle
is
driven
to
a
fair
by
a
general
drover
and
with
the
money
which
he
returns
to
the
farmer
the
rents
are
paid
the
price
regularly
expected
is
from
two
to
three
pounds
a
head
there
was
once
one
sold
for
five
pounds
they
go
from
the
islands
very
lean
and
are
not
offered
to
the
butcher
till
they
have
been
long
fatted
in
english
pastures
of
their
black
cattle
some
are
without
horns
called
by
the
scots
humble
cows
as
we
call
a
bee
an
humble
bee
that
wants
a
sting
whether
this
difference
be
specifick
or
accidental
though
we
inquired
with
great
diligence
we
could
not
be
informed
we
are
not
very
sure
that
the
bull
is
ever
without
horns
though
we
have
been
told
that
such
bulls
there
are
what
is
produced
by
putting
a
horned
and
unhorned
male
and
female
together
no
man
has
ever
tried
that
thought
the
result
worthy
of
observation
their
horses
are
like
their
cows
of
a
moderate
size
i
had
no
difficulty
to
mount
myself
commodiously
by
the
favour
of
the
gentlemen
i
heard
of
very
little
cows
in
barra
and
very
little
horses
in
rum
where
perhaps
no
care
is
taken
to
prevent
that
diminution
of
size
which
must
always
happen
where
the
greater
and
the
less
copulate
promiscuously
and
the
young
animal
is
restrained
from
growth
by
penury
of
sustenance
the
goat
is
the
general
inhabitant
of
the
earth
complying
with
every
difference
of
climate
and
of
soil
the
goats
of
the
hebrides
are
like
others
nor
did
i
hear
any
thing
of
their
sheep
to
be
particularly
remarked
in
the
penury
of
these
malignant
regions
nothing
is
left
that
can
be
converted
to
food
the
goats
and
the
sheep
are
milked
like
the
cows
a
single
meal
of
a
goat
is
a
quart
and
of
a
sheep
a
pint
such
at
least
was
the
account
which
i
could
extract
from
those
of
whom
i
am
not
sure
that
they
ever
had
inquired
the
milk
of
goats
is
much
thinner
than
that
of
cows
and
that
of
sheep
is
much
thicker
sheeps
milk
is
never
eaten
before
it
is
boiled
as
it
is
thick
it
must
be
very
liberal
of
curd
and
the
people
of
kilda
form
it
into
small
cheeses
the
stags
of
the
mountains
are
less
than
those
of
our
parks
or
forests
perhaps
not
bigger
than
our
fallow
deer
their
flesh
has
no
rankness
nor
is
inferiour
in
flavour
to
our
common
venison
the
roebuck
i
neither
saw
nor
tasted
these
are
not
countries
for
a
regular
chase
the
deer
are
not
driven
with
horns
and
hounds
a
sportsman
with
his
gun
in
his
hand
watches
the
animal
and
when
he
has
wounded
him
traces
him
by
the
blood
they
have
a
race
of
brinded
greyhounds
larger
and
stronger
than
those
with
which
we
course
hares
and
those
are
the
only
dogs
used
by
them
for
the
chase
man
is
by
the
use
of
made
so
much
an
overmatch
for
other
animals
that
in
all
countries
where
they
are
in
use
the
wild
part
of
the
creation
sensibly
diminishes
there
will
probably
not
be
long
either
stags
or
roebucks
in
the
islands
all
the
beasts
of
chase
would
have
been
lost
long
ago
in
countries
well
inhabited
had
they
not
been
preserved
by
laws
for
the
pleasure
of
the
rich
there
are
in
sky
neither
rats
nor
mice
but
the
weasel
is
so
frequent
that
he
is
heard
in
houses
rattling
behind
chests
or
beds
as
rats
in
england
they
probably
owe
to
his
predominance
that
they
have
no
other
vermin
for
since
the
great
rat
took
possession
of
this
part
of
the
world
scarce
a
ship
can
touch
at
any
port
but
some
of
his
race
are
left
behind
they
have
within
these
few
years
began
to
infest
the
isle
of
col
where
being
left
by
some
trading
vessel
they
have
increased
for
want
of
weasels
to
oppose
them
the
inhabitants
of
sky
and
of
the
other
islands
which
i
have
seen
are
commonly
of
the
middle
stature
with
fewer
among
them
very
tall
or
very
short
than
are
seen
in
england
or
perhaps
as
their
numbers
are
small
the
chances
of
any
deviation
from
the
common
measure
are
necessarily
few
the
tallest
men
that
i
saw
are
among
those
of
higher
rank
in
regions
of
barrenness
and
scarcity
the
human
race
is
hindered
in
its
growth
by
the
same
causes
as
other
animals
the
ladies
have
as
much
beauty
here
as
in
other
places
but
bloom
and
softness
are
not
to
be
expected
among
the
lower
classes
whose
faces
are
exposed
to
the
rudeness
of
the
climate
and
whose
features
are
sometimes
contracted
by
want
and
sometimes
hardened
by
the
blasts
supreme
beauty
is
seldom
found
in
cottages
or
even
where
no
real
hardships
are
suffered
to
expand
the
human
face
to
its
full
perfection
it
seems
necessary
that
the
mind
should
by
placidness
of
content
or
consciousness
of
superiority
their
strength
is
proportionate
to
their
size
but
they
are
accustomed
to
run
upon
rough
ground
and
therefore
can
with
great
agility
skip
over
the
bog
or
clamber
the
mountain
for
a
campaign
in
the
wastes
of
america
soldiers
better
qualified
could
not
have
been
found
having
little
work
to
do
they
are
not
willing
nor
perhaps
able
to
endure
a
long
continuance
of
manual
labour
and
are
therefore
considered
as
habitually
idle
having
never
been
supplied
with
those
accommodations
which
life
extensively
diversified
with
trades
affords
they
supply
their
wants
by
very
insufficient
shifts
and
endure
many
inconveniences
which
a
little
attention
would
easily
relieve
i
have
seen
a
horse
carrying
home
the
harvest
on
a
crate
under
his
tail
was
a
stick
for
a
crupper
held
at
the
two
ends
by
twists
of
straw
hemp
will
grow
in
their
islands
and
therefore
ropes
may
be
had
if
they
wanted
hemp
they
might
make
better
cordage
of
rushes
or
perhaps
of
nettles
than
of
straw
their
method
of
life
neither
secures
them
perpetual
health
nor
exposes
them
to
any
particular
diseases
there
are
physicians
in
the
islands
who
i
believe
all
practise
chirurgery
and
all
compound
their
own
medicines
it
is
generally
supposed
that
life
is
longer
in
places
where
there
are
few
opportunities
of
luxury
but
i
found
no
instance
here
of
extraordinary
longevity
a
cottager
grows
old
over
his
oaten
cakes
like
a
citizen
at
a
turtle
feast
he
is
indeed
seldom
incommoded
by
corpulence
poverty
preserves
him
from
sinking
under
the
burden
of
himself
but
he
escapes
no
other
injury
of
time
instances
of
long
life
are
often
related
which
those
who
hear
them
are
more
willing
to
credit
than
examine
to
be
told
that
any
man
has
attained
a
hundred
years
gives
hope
and
comfort
to
him
who
stands
trembling
on
the
brink
of
his
own
climacterick
length
of
life
is
distributed
impartially
to
very
different
modes
of
life
in
very
different
climates
and
the
mountains
have
no
greater
examples
of
age
and
health
than
the
low
lands
where
i
was
introduced
to
two
ladies
of
high
quality
one
of
whom
in
her
year
presided
at
her
table
with
the
full
exercise
of
all
her
powers
and
the
other
has
attained
her
without
any
diminution
of
her
vivacity
and
with
little
reason
to
accuse
time
of
depredations
on
her
beauty
in
the
islands
as
in
most
other
places
the
inhabitants
are
of
different
rank
and
one
does
not
encroach
here
upon
another
where
there
is
no
commerce
nor
manufacture
he
that
is
born
poor
can
scarcely
become
rich
and
if
none
are
able
to
buy
estates
he
that
is
born
to
land
can
not
annihilate
his
family
by
selling
it
this
was
once
the
state
of
these
countries
perhaps
there
is
no
example
till
within
a
century
and
half
of
any
family
whose
estate
was
alienated
otherwise
than
by
violence
or
forfeiture
since
money
has
been
brought
amongst
them
they
have
found
like
others
the
art
of
spending
more
than
they
receive
and
i
saw
with
grief
the
chief
of
a
very
ancient
clan
whose
island
was
condemned
by
law
to
be
sold
for
the
satisfaction
of
his
creditors
the
name
of
highest
dignity
is
laird
of
which
there
are
in
the
extensive
isle
of
sky
only
three
macdonald
macleod
and
mackinnon
the
laird
is
the
original
owner
of
the
land
whose
natural
power
must
be
very
great
where
no
man
lives
but
by
agriculture
and
where
the
produce
of
the
land
is
not
conveyed
through
the
labyrinths
of
traffick
but
passes
directly
from
the
hand
that
gathers
it
to
the
mouth
that
eats
it
the
laird
has
all
those
in
his
power
that
live
upon
his
farms
kings
can
for
the
most
part
only
exalt
or
degrade
the
laird
at
pleasure
can
feed
or
starve
can
give
bread
or
withold
it
this
inherent
power
was
yet
strengthened
by
the
kindness
of
consanguinity
and
the
reverence
of
patriarchal
authority
the
laird
was
the
father
of
the
clan
and
his
tenants
commonly
bore
his
name
and
to
these
principles
of
original
command
was
added
for
many
ages
an
exclusive
right
of
legal
jurisdiction
this
multifarious
and
extensive
obligation
operated
with
force
scarcely
credible
every
duty
moral
or
political
was
absorbed
in
affection
and
adherence
to
the
chief
not
many
years
have
passed
since
the
clans
knew
no
law
but
the
laird
will
he
told
them
to
whom
they
should
be
friends
or
enemies
what
king
they
should
obey
and
what
religion
they
should
profess
when
the
scots
first
rose
in
arms
against
the
succession
of
the
house
of
hanover
lovat
the
chief
of
the
frasers
was
in
exile
for
a
rape
the
frasers
were
very
numerous
and
very
zealous
against
the
government
a
pardon
was
sent
to
lovat
he
came
to
the
english
camp
and
the
clan
immediately
deserted
to
him
next
in
dignity
to
the
laird
is
the
tacksman
a
large
taker
or
of
land
of
which
he
keeps
part
as
a
domain
in
his
own
hand
and
lets
part
to
under
tenants
the
tacksman
is
necessarily
a
man
capable
of
securing
to
the
laird
the
whole
rent
and
is
commonly
a
collateral
relation
these
tacks
or
subordinate
possessions
were
long
considered
as
hereditary
and
the
occupant
was
distinguished
by
the
name
of
the
place
at
which
he
resided
he
held
a
middle
station
by
which
the
highest
and
the
lowest
orders
were
connected
he
paid
rent
and
reverence
to
the
laird
and
received
them
from
the
tenants
this
tenure
still
subsists
with
its
original
operation
but
not
with
the
primitive
stability
since
the
islanders
no
longer
content
to
live
have
learned
the
desire
of
growing
rich
an
ancient
dependent
is
in
danger
of
giving
way
to
a
higher
bidder
at
the
expense
of
domestick
dignity
and
hereditary
power
the
stranger
whose
money
buys
him
preference
considers
himself
as
paying
for
all
that
he
has
and
is
indifferent
about
the
laird
honour
or
safety
the
commodiousness
of
money
is
indeed
great
but
there
are
some
advantages
which
money
can
not
buy
and
which
therefore
no
wise
man
will
by
the
love
of
money
be
tempted
to
forego
i
have
found
in
the
hither
parts
of
scotland
men
not
defective
in
judgment
or
general
experience
who
consider
the
tacksman
as
a
useless
burden
of
the
ground
as
a
drone
who
lives
upon
the
product
of
an
estate
without
the
right
of
property
or
the
merit
of
labour
and
who
impoverishes
at
once
the
landlord
and
the
tenant
the
land
say
they
is
let
to
the
tacksman
at
sixpence
an
acre
and
by
him
to
the
tenant
at
pence
let
the
owner
be
the
immediate
landlord
to
all
the
tenants
if
he
sets
the
ground
at
he
will
increase
his
revenue
by
a
fourth
part
and
the
tenant
burthen
will
be
diminished
by
a
fifth
those
who
pursue
this
train
of
reasoning
seem
not
sufficiently
to
inquire
whither
it
will
lead
them
nor
to
know
that
it
will
equally
shew
the
propriety
of
suppressing
all
wholesale
trade
of
shutting
up
the
shops
of
every
man
who
sells
what
he
does
not
make
and
of
extruding
all
whose
agency
and
profit
intervene
between
the
manufacturer
and
the
consumer
they
may
by
stretching
their
understandings
a
little
wider
comprehend
that
all
those
who
by
undertaking
large
quantities
of
manufacture
and
affording
employment
to
many
labourers
make
themselves
considered
as
benefactors
to
the
publick
have
only
been
robbing
their
workmen
with
one
hand
and
their
customers
with
the
other
if
crowley
had
sold
only
what
he
could
make
and
all
his
smiths
had
wrought
their
own
iron
with
their
own
hammers
he
would
have
lived
on
less
and
they
would
have
sold
their
work
for
more
the
salaries
of
superintendents
and
clerks
would
have
been
partly
saved
and
partly
shared
and
nails
been
sometimes
cheaper
by
a
farthing
in
a
hundred
but
then
if
the
smith
could
not
have
found
an
immediate
purchaser
he
must
have
deserted
his
anvil
if
there
had
by
accident
at
any
time
been
more
sellers
than
buyers
the
workmen
must
have
reduced
their
profit
to
nothing
by
underselling
one
another
and
as
no
great
stock
could
have
been
in
any
hand
no
sudden
demand
of
large
quantities
could
have
been
answered
and
the
builder
must
have
stood
still
till
the
nailer
could
supply
him
according
to
these
schemes
universal
plenty
is
to
begin
and
end
in
universal
misery
hope
and
emulation
will
be
utterly
extinguished
and
as
all
must
obey
the
call
of
immediate
necessity
nothing
that
requires
extensive
views
or
provides
for
distant
consequences
will
ever
be
performed
to
the
southern
inhabitants
of
scotland
the
state
of
the
mountains
and
the
islands
is
equally
unknown
with
that
of
borneo
or
sumatra
of
both
they
have
only
heard
a
little
and
guess
the
rest
they
are
strangers
to
the
language
and
the
manners
to
the
advantages
and
wants
of
the
people
whose
life
they
would
model

the

an
expeditious
mode

but
little
abundance
which
there
is
nobody
to
enjoy
contributes
little
to
human
happiness
as
the

must
govern

in

society
the
man

intelligence
must
direct
the

the

in

state
be
given
up
to
grossness
and
ignorance
the

for

of
instruction
will
be
unskilful
and
for

of
admonition
will
be
negligent
the
laird
in
these
wide
estates
which
often
consist
of
islands
remote
from

another
can
not
extend
his
personal
influence
to
all
his

the
steward

no
dignity
annexed

character
can
have
little
authority
among
men
taught
to
pay
reverence
only
to
birth

who
regard
the
tacksman
as
their
hereditary
superior
nor
can
the

have
equal
zeal
for
the
prosperity
of
an
estate
profitable
only
to
the
laird

the

has
the

in

their

by
becoming
farmers
if
the
tacksmen
be
banished
who
will
be
left
to

the
laird
must
always
be
at
a
distance
from
the
greater
part
of
his
lands
and
if
he
resides
at
all
upon
them
must
drag
his
days
in
solitude
having
no
longer
either
a
friend
or
a
companion
he
will
therefore
depart
to
some
more
comfortable
residence
and
leave
the
tenants
to
the
wisdom
and
mercy
of
a
factor
of
tenants
there
are
different
orders
as
they
have
greater
or
less
stock
land
is
sometimes
leased
to
a
small
fellowship
who
live
in
a
cluster
of
huts
called
a
tenants
town
and
are
bound
jointly
and
separately
for
the
payment
of
their
rent
these
i
believe
employ
in
the
care
of
their
cattle
and
the
labour
of
tillage
a
kind
of
tenants
yet
lower
who
having
a
hut
with
grass
for
a
certain
number
of
cows
and
sheep
pay
their
rent
by
a
stipulated
quantity
of
labour
the
condition
of
domestick
servants
or
the
price
of
occasional
labour
i
do
not
know
with
certainty
i
was
told
that
the
maids
have
sheep
and
are
allowed
to
spin
for
their
own
clothing
perhaps
they
have
no
pecuniary
wages
or
none
but
in
very
wealthy
families
the
state
of
life
which
has
hitherto
been
purely
pastoral
begins
now
to
be
a
little
variegated
with
commerce
but
novelties
enter
by
degrees
and
till
one
mode
has
fully
prevailed
over
the
other
no
settled
notion
can
be
formed
such
is
the
system
of
insular
subordination
which
having
little
variety
can
not
afford
much
delight
in
the
view
nor
long
detain
the
mind
in
contemplation
the
inhabitants
were
for
a
long
time
perhaps
not
unhappy
but
their
content
was
a
muddy
mixture
of
pride
and
ignorance
an
indifference
for
pleasures
which
they
did
not
know
a
blind
veneration
for
their
chiefs
and
a
strong
conviction
of
their
own
importance
their
pride
has
been
crushed
by
the
heavy
hand
of
a
vindictive
conqueror
whose
seventies
have
been
followed
by
laws
which
though
they
can
not
be
called
cruel
have
produced
much
discontent
because
they
operate
upon
the
surface
of
life
and
make
every
eye
bear
witness
to
subjection
to
be
compelled
to
a
new
dress
has
always
been
found
painful
their
chiefs
being
now
deprived
of
their
jurisdiction
have
already
lost
much
of
their
influence
and
as
they
gradually
degenerate
from
patriarchal
rulers
to
rapacious
landlords
they
will
divest
themselves
of
the
little
that
remains
that
dignity
which
they
derived
from
an
opinion
of
their
military
importance
the
law
which
disarmed
them
has
abated
an
old
gentleman
delighting
himself
with
the
recollection
of
better
days
related
that
forty
years
ago
a
chieftain
walked
out
attended
by
ten
or
twelve
followers
with
their
arms
rattling
that
animating
rabble
has
now
ceased
the
chief
has
lost
his
formidable
retinue
and
the
highlander
walks
his
heath
unarmed
and
defenceless
with
the
peaceable
submission
of
a
french
peasant
or
english
cottager
their
ignorance
grows
every
day
less
but
their
knowledge
is
yet
of
little
other
use
than
to
shew
them
their
wants
they
are
now
in
the
period
of
education
and
feel
the
uneasiness
of
discipline
without
yet
perceiving
the
benefit
of
instruction
the
last
law
by
which
the
highlanders
are
deprived
of
their
arms
has
operated
with
efficacy
beyond
expectation
of
former
statutes
made
with
the
same
design
the
execution
had
been
feeble
and
the
effect
inconsiderable
concealment
was
undoubtedly
practised
and
perhaps
often
with
connivance
there
was
tenderness
or
partiality
on
one
side
and
obstinacy
on
the
other
but
the
law
which
followed
the
victory
of
culloden
found
the
whole
nation
dejected
and
intimidated
informations
were
given
without
danger
and
without
fear
and
the
arms
were
collected
with
such
rigour
that
every
house
was
despoiled
of
its
defence
to
disarm
part
of
the
highlands
could
give
no
reasonable
occasion
of
complaint
every
government
must
be
allowed
the
power
of
taking
away
the
weapon
that
is
lifted
against
it
but
the
loyal
clans
murmured
with
some
appearance
of
justice
that
after
having
defended
the
king
they
were
forbidden
for
the
future
to
defend
themselves
and
that
the
sword
should
be
forfeited
which
had
been
legally
employed
their
case
is
undoubtedly
hard
but
in
political
regulations
good
can
not
be
complete
it
can
only
be
predominant
whether
by
disarming
a
people
thus
broken
into
several
tribes
and
thus
remote
from
the
seat
of
power
more
good
than
evil
has
been
produced
may
deserve
inquiry
the
supreme
power
in
every
community
has
the
right
of
debarring
every
individual
and
every
subordinate
society
from
only
because
the
supreme
power
is
able
to
defend
them
and
therefore
where
the
governor
can
not
act
he
must
trust
the
subject
to
act
for
himself
these
islands
might
be
wasted
with
fire
and
sword
before
their
sovereign
would
know
their
distress
a
gang
of
robbers
such
as
has
been
lately
found
confederating
themselves
in
the
highlands
might
lay
a
wide
region
under
contribution
the
crew
of
a
petty
privateer
might
land
on
the
largest
and
most
wealthy
of
the
islands
and
riot
without
control
in
cruelty
and
waste
it
was
observed
by
one
of
the
chiefs
of
sky
that
fifty
armed
men
might
without
resistance
ravage
the
country
laws
that
place
the
subjects
in
such
a
state
contravene
the
first
principles
of
the
compact
of
authority
they
exact
obedience
and
yield
no
protection
it
affords
a
generous
and
manly
pleasure
to
conceive
a
little
nation
gathering
its
fruits
and
tending
its
herds
with
fearless
confidence
though
it
lies
open
on
every
side
to
invasion
where
in
contempt
of
walls
and
trenches
every
man
sleeps
securely
with
his
sword
beside
him
where
all
on
the
first
approach
of
hostility
came
together
at
the
call
to
battle
as
at
a
summons
to
a
festal
show
and
committing
their
cattle
to
the
care
of
those
whom
age
or
nature
has
disabled
engage
the
enemy
with
that
competition
for
hazard
and
for
glory
which
operate
in
men
that
fight
under
the
eye
of
those
whose
dislike
or
kindness
they
have
always
considered
as
the
greatest
evil
or
the
greatest
good
this
was
in
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
the
state
of
the
highlands
every
man
was
a
soldier
who
partook
of
national
confidence
and
interested
himself
in
national
honour
to
lose
this
spirit
is
to
lose
what
no
small
advantage
will
compensate
it
may
likewise
deserve
to
be
inquired
whether
a
great
nation
ought
to
be
totally
commercial
whether
amidst
the
uncertainty
of
human
affairs
too
much
attention
to
one
mode
of
happiness
may
not
endanger
others
whether
the
pride
of
riches
must
not
sometimes
have
recourse
to
the
protection
of
courage
and
whether
if
it
be
necessary
to
preserve
in
some
part
of
the
empire
the
military
spirit
it
can
subsist
more
commodiously
in
any
place
than
in
remote
and
unprofitable
provinces
where
it
can
commonly
do
little
harm
and
whence
it
may
be
called
forth
at
any
sudden
exigence
it
must
however
be
confessed
that
a
man
who
places
honour
only
in
successful
violence
is
a
very
troublesome
and
pernicious
animal
in
time
of
peace
and
that
the
martial
character
can
not
prevail
in
a
whole
people
but
by
the
diminution
of
all
other
virtues
he
that
is
accustomed
to
resolve
all
right
into
conquest
will
have
very
little
tenderness
or
equity
all
the
friendship
in
such
a
life
can
be
only
a
confederacy
of
invasion
or
alliance
of
defence
the
strong
must
flourish
by
force
and
the
weak
subsist
by
stratagem
till
the
highlanders
lost
their
ferocity
with
their
arms
they
suffered
from
each
other
all
that
malignity
could
dictate
or
precipitance
could
act
every
provocation
was
revenged
with
blood
and
no
man
that
ventured
into
a
numerous
company
by
whatever
occasion
brought
together
was
sure
of
returning
without
a
wound
if
they
are
now
exposed
to
foreign
hostilities
they
may
talk
of
the
danger
but
can
seldom
feel
it
if
they
are
no
longer
martial
they
are
no
longer
quarrelsome
misery
is
caused
for
the
most
part
not
by
a
heavy
crush
of
disaster
but
by
the
corrosion
of
less
visible
evils
which
canker
enjoyment
and
undermine
security
the
visit
of
an
invader
is
necessarily
rare
but
domestick
animosities
allow
no
cessation
the
abolition
of
the
local
jurisdictions
which
had
for
so
many
ages
been
exercised
by
the
chiefs
has
likewise
its
evil
and
its
good
the
feudal
constitution
naturally
diffused
itself
into
long
ramifications
of
subordinate
authority
to
this
general
temper
of
the
government
was
added
the
peculiar
form
of
the
country
broken
by
mountains
into
many
subdivisions
scarcely
accessible
but
to
the
natives
and
guarded
by
passes
or
perplexed
with
intricacies
through
which
national
justice
could
not
find
its
way
the
power
of
deciding
controversies
and
of
punishing
offences
as
some
such
power
there
must
always
be
was
intrusted
to
the
lairds
of
the
country
to
those
whom
the
people
considered
as
their
natural
judges
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
a
rugged
proprietor
of
the
rocks
unprincipled
and
unenlightened
was
a
nice
resolver
of
entangled
claims
or
very
exact
in
proportioning
punishment
to
offences
but
the
more
he
indulged
his
own
will
the
more
he
held
his
vassals
in
dependence
prudence
and
innocence
without
the
favour
of
the
chief
conferred
no
security
and
crimes
involved
no
danger
when
the
judge
was
resolute
to
acquit
when
the
chiefs
were
men
of
knowledge
and
virtue
the
convenience
of
a
domestick
judicature
was
great
no
long
journies
were
necessary
nor
artificial
delays
could
be
practised
the
character
the
alliances
and
interests
of
the
litigants
were
known
to
the
court
and
all
false
pretences
were
easily
detected
the
sentence
when
it
was
past
could
not
be
evaded
the
power
of
the
laird
superseded
formalities
and
justice
could
not
be
defeated
by
interest
or
stratagem
i
doubt
not
but
that
since
the
regular
judges
have
made
their
circuits
through
the
whole
country
right
has
been
every
where
more
wisely
and
more
equally
distributed
the
complaint
is
that
litigation
is
grown
troublesome
and
that
the
magistrates
are
too
few
and
therefore
often
too
remote
for
general
convenience
many
of
the
smaller
islands
have
no
legal
officer
within
them
i
once
asked
if
a
crime
should
be
committed
by
what
authority
the
offender
could
be
seized
and
was
told
that
the
laird
would
exert
his
right
a
right
which
he
must
now
usurp
but
which
surely
necessity
must
vindicate
and
which
is
therefore
yet
exercised
in
lower
degrees
by
some
of
the
proprietors
when
legal
processes
can
not
be
obtained
in
all
greater
questions
however
there
is
now
happily
an
end
to
all
fear
or
hope
from
malice
or
from
favour
the
roads
are
secure
in
those
places
through
which
forty
years
ago
no
traveller
could
pass
without
a
convoy
all
trials
of
right
by
the
sword
are
forgotten
and
the
mean
are
in
as
little
danger
from
the
powerful
as
in
other
places
no
scheme
of
policy
has
in
any
country
yet
brought
the
rich
and
poor
on
equal
terms
into
courts
of
judicature
perhaps
experience
improving
on
experience
may
in
time
effect
it
those
who
have
long
enjoyed
dignity
and
power
ought
not
to
lose
it
without
some
equivalent
there
was
paid
to
the
chiefs
by
the
publick
in
exchange
for
their
privileges
perhaps
a
sum
greater
than
most
of
them
had
ever
possessed
which
excited
a
thirst
for
riches
of
which
it
shewed
them
the
use
when
the
power
of
birth
and
station
ceases
no
hope
remains
but
from
the
prevalence
of
money
power
and
wealth
supply
the
place
of
each
other
power
confers
the
ability
of
gratifying
our
desire
without
the
consent
of
others
wealth
enables
us
to
obtain
the
consent
of
others
to
our
gratification
power
simply
considered
whatever
it
confers
on
one
must
take
from
another
wealth
enables
its
owner
to
give
to
others
by
taking
only
from
himself
power
pleases
the
violent
and
proud
wealth
delights
the
placid
and
the
timorous
youth
therefore
flies
at
power
and
age
grovels
after
riches
the
chiefs
divested
of
their
prerogatives
necessarily
turned
their
thoughts
to
the
improvement
of
their
revenues
and
expect
more
rent
as
they
have
less
homage
the
tenant
who
is
far
from
perceiving
that
his
condition
is
made
better
in
the
same
proportion
as
that
of
his
landlord
is
made
worse
does
not
immediately
see
why
his
industry
is
to
be
taxed
more
heavily
than
before
he
refuses
to
pay
the
demand
and
is
ejected
the
ground
is
then
let
to
a
stranger
who
perhaps
brings
a
larger
stock
but
who
taking
the
land
at
its
full
price
treats
with
the
laird
upon
equal
terms
and
considers
him
not
as
a
chief
but
as
a
trafficker
in
land
thus
the
estate
perhaps
is
improved
but
the
clan
is
broken
it
seems
to
be
the
general
opinion
that
the
rents
have
been
raised
with
too
much
eagerness
some
regard
must
be
paid
to
prejudice
those
who
have
hitherto
paid
but
little
will
not
suddenly
be
persuaded
to
pay
much
though
they
can
afford
it
as
ground
is
gradually
improved
and
the
value
of
money
decreases
the
rent
may
be
raised
without
any
diminution
of
the
farmer
profits
yet
it
is
necessary
in
these
countries
where
the
ejection
of
a
tenant
is
a
greater
evil
than
in
more
populous
places
to
consider
not
merely
what
the
land
will
produce
but
with
what
ability
the
inhabitant
can
cultivate
it
a
certain
stock
can
allow
but
a
certain
payment
for
if
the
land
be
doubled
and
the
stock
remains
the
same
the
tenant
becomes
no
richer
the
proprietors
of
the
highlands
might
perhaps
often
increase
their
income
by
subdividing
the
farms
and
allotting
to
every
occupier
only
so
many
acres
as
he
can
profitably
employ
but
that
they
want
people
there
seems
now
whatever
be
the
cause
to
be
through
a
great
part
of
the
highlands
a
general
discontent
that
adherence
which
was
lately
professed
by
every
man
to
the
chief
of
his
name
has
now
little
prevalence
and
he
that
can
not
live
as
he
desires
at
home
listens
to
the
tale
of
fortunate
islands
and
happy
regions
where
every
man
may
have
land
of
his
own
and
eat
the
product
of
his
labour
without
a
superior
those
who
have
obtained
grants
of
american
lands
have
as
is
well
known
invited
settlers
from
all
quarters
of
the
globe
and
among
other
places
where
oppression
might
produce
a
wish
for
new
habitations
their
emissaries
would
not
fail
to
try
their
persuasions
in
the
isles
of
scotland
where
at
the
time
when
the
clans
were
newly
disunited
from
their
chiefs
and
exasperated
by
unprecedented
exactions
it
is
no
wonder
that
they
prevailed
whether
the
mischiefs
of
emigration
were
immediately
perceived
may
be
justly
questioned
they
who
went
first
were
probably
such
as
could
best
be
spared
but
the
accounts
sent
by
the
earliest
adventurers
whether
true
or
false
inclined
many
to
follow
them
and
whole
neighbourhoods
formed
parties
for
removal
so
that
departure
from
their
native
country
is
no
longer
exile
he
that
goes
thus
accompanied
carries
with
him
all
that
makes
life
pleasant
he
sits
down
in
a
better
climate
surrounded
by
his
kindred
and
his
friends
they
carry
with
them
their
language
their
opinions
their
popular
songs
and
hereditary
merriment
they
change
nothing
but
the
place
of
their
abode
and
of
that
change
they
perceive
the
benefit
this
is
the
real
effect
of
emigration
if
those
that
go
away
together
settle
on
the
same
spot
and
preserve
their
ancient
union
but
some
relate
that
these
adventurous
visitants
of
unknown
regions
after
a
voyage
passed
in
dreams
of
plenty
and
felicity
are
dispersed
at
last
upon
a
sylvan
wilderness
where
their
first
years
must
be
spent
in
toil
to
clear
the
ground
which
is
afterwards
to
be
tilled
and
that
the
whole
effect
of
their
undertakings
is
only
more
fatigue
and
equal
scarcity
both
accounts
may
be
suspected
those
who
are
gone
will
endeavour
by
every
art
to
draw
others
after
them
for
as
their
numbers
are
greater
they
will
provide
better
for
themselves
when
nova
scotia
was
first
peopled
i
remember
a
letter
published
under
the
character
of
a
new
planter
who
related
how
much
the
climate
put
him
in
mind
of
italy
such
intelligence
the
hebridians
probably
receive
from
their
transmarine
correspondents
but
with
equal
temptations
of
interest
and
perhaps
with
no
greater
niceness
of
veracity
the
owners
of
the
islands
spread
stories
of
american
hardships
to
keep
their
people
content
at
home
some
method
to
stop
this
epidemick
desire
of
wandering
which
spreads
its
contagion
from
valley
to
valley
deserves
to
be
sought
with
great
diligence
in
more
fruitful
countries
the
removal
of
one
only
makes
room
for
the
succession
of
another
but
in
the
hebrides
the
loss
of
an
inhabitant
leaves
a
lasting
vacuity
for
nobody
born
in
any
other
parts
of
the
world
will
choose
this
country
for
his
residence
and
an
island
once
depopulated
will
remain
a
desert
as
long
as
the
present
facility
of
travel
gives
every
one
who
is
discontented
and
unsettled
the
choice
of
his
abode
let
it
be
inquired
whether
the
first
intention
of
those
who
are
fluttering
on
the
wing
and
collecting
a
flock
that
they
may
take
their
flight
be
to
attain
good
or
to
avoid
evil
if
they
are
dissatisfied
with
that
part
of
the
globe
which
their
birth
has
allotted
them
and
resolve
not
to
live
without
the
pleasures
of
happier
climates
if
they
long
for
bright
suns
and
calm
skies
and
flowery
fields
and
fragrant
gardens
i
know
not
by
what
eloquence
they
can
be
persuaded
or
by
what
offers
they
can
be
hired
to
stay
but
if
they
are
driven
from
their
native
country
by
positive
evils
and
disgusted
by
real
or
imaginary
it
were
fit
to
remove
their
grievances
and
quiet
their
resentment
since
if
they
have
been
hitherto
undutiful
subjects
they
will
not
much
mend
their
principles
by
american
conversation
to
allure
them
into
the
army
it
was
thought
proper
to
indulge
them
in
the
continuance
of
their
national
dress
if
this
concession
could
have
any
effect
it
might
easily
be
made
that
dissimilitude
of
appearance
which
was
supposed
to
keep
them
distinct
from
the
rest
of
the
nation
might
disincline
them
from
coalescing
with
the
pensylvanians
or
people
of
connecticut
if
the
restitution
of
their
arms
will
reconcile
them
to
their
country
let
them
have
again
those
weapons
which
will
not
be
more
mischievous
at
home
than
in
the
colonies
that
they
may
not
fly
from
the
increase
of
rent
i
know
not
whether
the
general
good
does
not
require
that
the
landlords
be
for
a
time
restrained
in
their
demands
and
kept
quiet
by
pensions
proportionate
to
their
loss
to
hinder
insurrection
by
driving
away
the
people
and
to
govern
peaceably
by
having
no
subjects
is
an
expedient
that
argues
no
great
profundity
of
politicks
to
soften
the
obdurate
to
convince
the
mistaken
to
mollify
the
resentful
are
worthy
of
a
statesman
but
it
affords
a
legislator
little
to
consider
that
where
there
was
formerly
an
insurrection
there
is
now
a
wilderness
it
has
been
a
question
often
agitated
without
solution
why
those
northern
regions
are
now
so
thinly
peopled
which
formerly
overwhelmed
with
their
armies
the
roman
empire
the
question
supposes
what
i
believe
is
not
true
that
they
had
once
more
inhabitants
than
they
could
maintain
and
overflowed
only
because
they
were
full
this
is
to
estimate
the
manners
of
all
countries
and
ages
by
our
own
migration
while
the
state
of
life
was
unsettled
and
there
was
little
communication
of
intelligence
between
distant
places
was
among
the
wilder
nations
of
europe
capricious
and
casual
an
adventurous
projector
heard
of
a
fertile
coast
unoccupied
and
led
out
a
colony
a
chief
of
renown
for
bravery
called
the
young
men
together
and
led
them
out
to
try
what
fortune
would
present
when
caesar
was
in
gaul
he
found
the
helvetians
preparing
to
go
they
knew
not
whither
and
put
a
stop
to
their
motions
they
settled
again
in
their
own
country
where
they
were
so
far
from
wanting
room
that
they
had
accumulated
three
years
provision
for
their
march
the
religion
of
the
north
was
military
if
they
could
not
find
enemies
it
was
their
duty
to
make
them
they
travelled
in
quest
of
danger
and
willingly
took
the
chance
of
empire
or
death
if
their
troops
were
numerous
the
countries
from
which
they
were
collected
are
of
vast
extent
and
without
much
exuberance
of
people
great
armies
may
be
raised
where
every
man
is
a
soldier
but
their
true
numbers
were
never
known
those
who
were
conquered
by
them
are
their
historians
and
shame
may
have
excited
them
to
say
that
they
were
overwhelmed
with
multitudes
to
count
is
a
modern
practice
the
ancient
method
was
to
guess
and
when
numbers
are
guessed
they
are
always
magnified
thus
england
has
for
several
years
been
filled
with
the
atchievements
of
seventy
thousand
highlanders
employed
in
america
i
have
heard
from
an
english
officer
not
much
inclined
to
favour
them
that
their
behaviour
deserved
a
very
high
degree
of
military
praise
but
their
number
has
been
much
exaggerated
one
of
the
ministers
told
me
that
seventy
thousand
men
could
not
have
been
found
in
all
the
highlands
and
that
more
than
twelve
thousand
never
took
the
field
those
that
went
to
the
american
war
went
to
destruction
of
the
old
highland
regiment
consisting
of
twelve
hundred
only
survived
to
see
their
country
again
the
gothick
swarms
have
at
least
been
multiplied
with
equal
liberality
that
they
bore
no
great
proportion
to
the
inhabitants
in
whose
countries
they
settled
is
plain
from
the
paucity
of
northern
words
now
found
in
the
provincial
languages
their
country
was
not
deserted
for
want
of
room
because
it
was
covered
with
forests
of
vast
extent
and
the
first
effect
of
plenitude
of
inhabitants
is
the
destruction
of
wood
as
the
europeans
spread
over
america
the
lands
are
gradually
laid
naked
i
would
not
be
understood
to
say
that
necessity
had
never
any
part
in
their
expeditions
a
nation
whose
agriculture
is
scanty
or
unskilful
may
be
driven
out
by
famine
a
nation
of
hunters
may
have
exhausted
their
game
i
only
affirm
that
the
northern
regions
were
not
when
their
irruptions
subdued
the
romans
overpeopled
with
regard
to
their
real
extent
of
territory
and
power
of
fertility
in
a
country
fully
inhabited
however
afterward
laid
waste
evident
marks
will
remain
of
its
former
populousness
but
of
scandinavia
and
germany
nothing
is
known
but
that
as
we
trace
their
state
upwards
into
antiquity
their
woods
were
greater
and
their
cultivated
ground
was
less
that
causes
were
different
from
want
of
room
may
produce
a
general
disposition
to
seek
another
country
is
apparent
from
the
present
conduct
of
the
highlanders
who
are
in
some
places
ready
to
threaten
a
total
secession
the
numbers
which
have
already
gone
though
like
other
numbers
they
may
be
magnified
are
very
great
and
such
as
if
they
had
gone
together
and
agreed
upon
any
certain
settlement
might
have
founded
an
independent
government
in
the
depths
of
the
western
continent
nor
are
they
only
the
lowest
and
most
indigent
many
men
of
considerable
wealth
have
taken
with
them
their
train
of
labourers
and
dependants
and
if
they
continue
the
feudal
scheme
of
polity
may
establish
new
clans
in
the
other
hemisphere
that
the
immediate
motives
of
their
desertion
must
be
imputed
to
their
landlords
may
be
reasonably
concluded
because
some
lairds
of
more
prudence
and
less
rapacity
have
kept
their
vassals
undiminished
from
raasa
only
one
man
had
been
seduced
and
at
col
there
was
no
wish
to
go
away
the
traveller
who
comes
hither
from
more
opulent
countries
to
speculate
upon
the
remains
of
pastoral
life
will
not
much
wonder
that
a
common
highlander
has
no
strong
adherence
to
his
native
soil
for
of
animal
enjoyments
or
of
physical
good
he
leaves
nothing
that
he
may
not
find
again
wheresoever
he
may
be
thrown
the
habitations
of
men
in
the
hebrides
may
be
distinguished
into
huts
and
houses
by
a
house
i
mean
a
building
with
one
story
over
another
by
a
hut
a
dwelling
with
only
one
floor
the
laird
who
formerly
lived
in
a
castle
now
lives
in
a
house
sometimes
sufficiently
neat
but
seldom
very
spacious
or
splendid
the
tacksmen
and
the
ministers
have
commonly
houses
wherever
there
is
a
house
the
stranger
finds
a
welcome
and
to
the
other
evils
of
exterminating
tacksmen
may
be
added
the
unavoidable
cessation
of
hospitality
or
the
devolution
of
too
heavy
a
burden
on
the
ministers
of
the
houses
little
can
be
said
they
are
small
and
by
the
necessity
of
accumulating
stores
where
there
are
so
few
opportunities
of
purchase
the
rooms
are
very
heterogeneously
filled
with
want
of
cleanliness
it
were
ingratitude
to
reproach
them
the
servants
having
been
bred
upon
the
naked
earth
think
every
floor
clean
and
the
quick
succession
of
guests
perhaps
not
always
does
not
allow
much
time
for
adjusting
their
apartments
huts
are
of
many
gradations
from
murky
dens
to
commodious
dwellings
the
wall
of
a
common
hut
is
always
built
without
mortar
by
a
skilful
adaptation
of
loose
stones
sometimes
perhaps
a
double
wall
of
stones
is
raised
and
the
intermediate
space
filled
with
earth
the
air
is
thus
completely
excluded
some
walls
are
i
think
formed
of
turfs
held
together
by
a
wattle
or
texture
of
twigs
of
the
meanest
huts
the
first
room
is
lighted
by
the
entrance
and
the
second
by
the
smoke
hole
the
fire
is
usually
made
in
the
middle
but
there
are
huts
or
dwellings
of
only
one
story
inhabited
by
gentlemen
which
have
walls
cemented
with
mortar
glass
windows
and
boarded
floors
of
these
all
have
chimneys
and
some
chimneys
have
grates
the
house
and
the
furniture
are
not
always
nicely
suited
we
were
driven
once
by
missing
a
passage
to
the
hut
of
a
gentleman
where
after
a
very
liberal
supper
when
i
was
conducted
to
my
chamber
i
found
an
elegant
bed
of
indian
cotton
spread
with
fine
sheets
the
accommodation
was
flattering
i
undressed
myself
and
felt
my
feet
in
the
mire
the
bed
stood
upon
the
bare
earth
which
a
long
course
of
rain
had
softened
to
a
puddle
in
pastoral
countries
the
condition
of
the
lowest
rank
of
people
is
sufficiently
wretched
among
manufacturers
men
that
have
no
property
may
have
art
and
industry
which
make
them
necessary
and
therefore
valuable
but
where
flocks
and
corn
are
the
only
wealth
there
are
always
more
hands
than
work
and
of
that
work
there
is
little
in
which
skill
and
dexterity
can
be
much
distinguished
he
therefore
who
is
born
poor
never
can
be
rich
the
son
merely
occupies
the
place
of
the
father
and
life
knows
nothing
of
progression
or
advancement
the
petty
tenants
and
labouring
peasants
live
in
miserable
cabins
which
afford
them
little
more
than
shelter
from
the
storms
the
boor
of
norway
is
said
to
make
all
his
own
utensils
in
the
hebrides
whatever
might
be
their
ingenuity
the
want
of
wood
leaves
them
no
materials
they
are
probably
content
with
such
accommodations
as
stones
of
different
forms
and
sizes
can
afford
them
their
food
is
not
better
than
their
lodging
they
seldom
taste
the
flesh
of
land
animals
for
here
are
no
markets
what
each
man
eats
is
from
his
own
stock
the
great
effect
of
money
is
to
break
property
into
small
parts
in
towns
he
that
has
a
shilling
may
have
a
piece
of
meat
but
where
there
is
no
commerce
no
man
can
eat
mutton
but
by
killing
a
sheep
fish
in
fair
weather
they
need
not
want
but
i
believe
man
never
lives
long
on
fish
but
by
constraint
he
will
rather
feed
upon
roots
and
berries
the
only
fewel
of
the
islands
is
peat
their
wood
is
all
consumed
and
coal
they
have
not
yet
found
peat
is
dug
out
of
the
marshes
from
the
depth
of
one
foot
to
that
of
six
that
is
accounted
the
best
which
is
nearest
the
surface
it
appears
to
be
a
mass
of
black
earth
held
together
by
vegetable
fibres
i
know
not
whether
the
earth
be
bituminous
or
whether
the
fibres
be
not
the
only
combustible
part
which
by
heating
the
interposed
earth
red
hot
make
a
burning
mass
the
heat
is
not
very
strong
nor
lasting
the
ashes
are
yellowish
and
in
a
large
quantity
when
they
dig
peat
they
cut
it
into
square
pieces
and
pile
it
up
to
dry
beside
the
house
in
some
places
it
has
an
offensive
smell
it
is
like
wood
charked
for
the
smith
the
common
method
of
making
peat
fires
is
by
heaping
it
on
the
hearth
but
it
burns
well
in
grates
and
in
the
best
houses
is
so
used
the
common
opinion
is
that
peat
grows
again
where
it
has
been
cut
which
as
it
seems
to
be
chiefly
a
vegetable
substance
is
not
unlikely
to
be
true
whether
known
or
not
to
those
who
relate
it
there
are
water
mills
in
sky
and
raasa
but
where
they
are
too
far
distant
the
grind
their
oats
with
a
quern
or
which
consists
of
two
stones
about
a
foot
and
a
half
in
diameter
the
lower
is
a
little
convex
to
which
the
concavity
of
the
upper
must
be
fitted
in
the
middle
of
the
upper
stone
is
a
round
hole
and
on
one
side
is
a
long
handle
the
grinder
sheds
the
corn
gradually
into
the
hole
with
one
hand
and
works
the
handle
round
with
the
other
the
corn
slides
down
the
convexity
of
the
lower
stone
and
by
the
motion
of
the
upper
is
ground
in
its
passage
these
stones
are
found
in
lochabar
the
islands
afford
few
pleasures
except
to
the
hardy
sportsman
who
can
tread
the
moor
and
climb
the
mountain
the
distance
of
one
family
from
another
in
a
country
where
travelling
has
so
much
difficulty
makes
frequent
intercourse
impracticable
visits
last
several
days
and
are
commonly
paid
by
water
yet
i
never
saw
a
boat
furnished
with
benches
or
made
commodious
by
any
addition
to
the
first
fabric
conveniences
are
not
missed
where
they
never
were
enjoyed
the
solace
which
the
bagpipe
can
give
they
have
long
enjoyed
but
among
other
changes
which
the
last
revolution
introduced
the
use
of
the
bagpipe
begins
to
be
forgotten
some
of
the
chief
families
still
entertain
a
piper
whose
office
was
anciently
hereditary
macrimmon
was
piper
to
macleod
and
rankin
to
maclean
of
col
the
tunes
of
the
bagpipe
are
traditional
there
has
been
in
sky
beyond
all
time
of
memory
a
college
of
pipers
under
the
direction
of
macrimmon
which
is
not
quite
extinct
there
was
another
in
mull
superintended
by
rankin
which
expired
about
sixteen
years
ago
to
these
colleges
while
the
pipe
retained
its
honour
the
students
of
musick
repaired
for
education
i
have
had
my
dinner
exhilarated
by
the
bagpipe
at
armidale
at
dunvegan
and
in
col
the
general
conversation
of
the
islanders
has
nothing
particular
i
did
not
meet
with
the
inquisitiveness
of
which
i
have
read
and
suspect
the
judgment
to
have
been
rashly
made
a
stranger
of
curiosity
comes
into
a
place
where
a
stranger
is
seldom
seen
he
importunes
the
people
with
questions
of
which
they
can
not
guess
the
motive
and
gazes
with
surprise
on
things
which
they
having
had
them
always
before
their
eyes
do
not
suspect
of
any
thing
wonderful
he
appears
to
them
like
some
being
of
another
world
and
then
thinks
it
peculiar
that
they
take
their
turn
to
inquire
whence
he
comes
and
whither
he
is
going
the
islands
were
long
unfurnished
with
instruction
for
youth
and
none
but
the
sons
of
gentlemen
could
have
any
literature
there
are
now
parochial
schools
to
which
the
lord
of
every
manor
pays
a
certain
stipend
here
the
children
are
taught
to
read
but
by
the
rule
of
their
institution
they
teach
only
english
so
that
the
natives
read
a
language
which
they
may
never
use
or
understand
if
a
parish
which
often
happens
contains
several
islands
the
school
being
but
in
one
can
not
assist
the
rest
this
is
the
state
of
col
which
however
is
more
enlightened
than
some
other
places
for
the
deficiency
is
supplied
by
a
young
gentleman
who
for
his
own
improvement
travels
every
year
on
foot
over
the
highlands
to
the
session
at
aberdeen
and
at
his
return
during
the
vacation
teaches
to
read
and
write
in
his
native
island
in
sky
there
are
two
grammar
schools
where
boarders
are
taken
to
be
regularly
educated
the
price
of
board
is
from
three
pounds
to
four
pounds
ten
shillings
a
year
and
that
of
instruction
is
half
a
crown
a
quarter
but
the
scholars
are
birds
of
passage
who
live
at
school
only
in
the
summer
for
in
winter
provisions
can
not
be
made
for
any
considerable
number
in
one
place
this
periodical
dispersion
impresses
strongly
the
scarcity
of
these
countries
having
heard
of
no
for
ladies
nearer
than
inverness
i
suppose
their
education
is
generally
domestick
the
elder
daughters
of
the
higher
families
are
sent
into
the
world
and
may
contribute
by
their
acquisitions
to
the
improvement
of
the
rest
women
must
here
study
to
be
either
pleasing
or
useful
their
deficiencies
are
seldom
supplied
by
very
liberal
fortunes
a
hundred
pounds
is
a
portion
beyond
the
hope
of
any
but
the
laird
daughter
they
do
not
indeed
often
give
money
with
their
daughters
the
question
is
how
many
cows
a
young
lady
will
bring
her
husband
a
rich
maiden
has
from
ten
to
forty
but
two
cows
are
a
decent
fortune
for
one
who
pretends
to
no
distinction
the
religion
of
the
islands
is
that
of
the
kirk
of
scotland
the
gentlemen
with
whom
i
conversed
are
all
inclined
to
the
english
liturgy
but
they
are
obliged
to
maintain
the
established
minister
and
the
country
is
too
poor
to
afford
payment
to
another
who
must
live
wholly
on
the
contribution
of
his
audience
they
therefore
all
attend
the
worship
of
the
kirk
as
often
as
a
visit
from
their
minister
or
the
practicability
of
travelling
gives
them
opportunity
nor
have
they
any
reason
to
complain
of
insufficient
pastors
for
i
saw
not
one
in
the
islands
whom
i
had
reason
to
think
either
deficient
in
learning
or
irregular
in
life
but
found
several
with
whom
i
could
not
converse
without
wishing
as
my
respect
increased
that
they
had
not
been
presbyterians
the
ancient
rigour
of
puritanism
is
now
very
much
relaxed
though
all
are
not
yet
equally
enlightened
i
sometimes
met
with
prejudices
sufficiently
malignant
but
they
were
prejudices
of
ignorance
the
ministers
in
the
islands
had
attained
such
knowledge
as
may
justly
be
admired
in
men
who
have
no
motive
to
study
but
generous
curiosity
or
what
is
still
better
desire
of
usefulness
with
such
politeness
as
so
narrow
a
circle
of
converse
could
not
have
supplied
but
to
minds
naturally
disposed
to
elegance
reason
and
truth
will
prevail
at
last
the
most
learned
of
the
scottish
doctors
would
now
gladly
admit
a
form
of
prayer
if
the
people
would
endure
it
the
zeal
or
rage
of
congregations
has
its
different
degrees
in
some
parishes
the
lord
prayer
is
suffered
in
others
it
is
still
rejected
as
a
form
and
he
that
should
make
it
part
of
his
supplication
would
be
suspected
of
heretical
pravity
the
principle
upon
which
extemporary
prayer
was
originally
introduced
is
no
longer
admitted
the
minister
formerly
in
the
effusion
of
his
prayer
expected
immediate
and
perhaps
perceptible
inspiration
and
therefore
thought
it
his
duty
not
to
think
before
what
he
should
say
it
is
now
universally
confessed
that
men
pray
as
they
speak
on
other
occasions
according
to
the
general
measure
of
their
abilities
and
attainments
whatever
each
may
think
of
a
form
prescribed
by
another
he
can
not
but
believe
that
he
can
himself
compose
by
study
and
meditation
a
better
prayer
than
will
rise
in
his
mind
at
a
sudden
call
and
if
he
has
any
hope
of
supernatural
help
why
may
he
not
as
well
receive
it
when
he
writes
as
when
he
speaks
in
the
variety
of
mental
powers
some
must
perform
extemporary
prayer
with
much
imperfection
and
in
the
eagerness
and
rashness
of
contradictory
opinions
if
publick
liturgy
be
left
to
the
private
judgment
of
every
minister
the
congregation
may
often
be
offended
or
misled
there
is
in
scotland
as
among
ourselves
a
restless
suspicion
of
popish
machinations
and
a
clamour
of
numerous
converts
to
the
romish
religion
the
report
is
i
believe
in
both
parts
of
the
island
equally
false
the
romish
religion
is
professed
only
in
egg
and
canna
two
small
islands
into
which
the
reformation
never
made
its
way
if
any
missionaries
are
busy
in
the
highlands
their
zeal
entitles
them
to
respect
even
from
those
who
can
not
think
favourably
of
their
doctrine
the
political
tenets
of
the
islanders
i
was
not
curious
to
investigate
and
they
were
not
eager
to
obtrude
their
conversation
is
decent
and
inoffensive
they
disdain
to
drink
for
their
principles
and
there
is
no
disaffection
at
their
tables
i
never
heard
a
health
offered
by
a
highlander
that
might
not
have
circulated
with
propriety
within
the
precincts
of
the
king
palace
legal
government
has
yet
something
of
novelty
to
which
they
can
not
perfectly
conform
the
ancient
spirit
that
appealed
only
to
the
sword
is
yet
among
them
the
tenant
of
scalpa
an
island
belonging
to
macdonald
took
no
care
to
bring
his
rent
when
the
landlord
talked
of
exacting
payment
he
declared
his
resolution
to
keep
his
ground
and
drive
all
intruders
from
the
island
and
continued
to
feed
his
cattle
as
on
his
own
land
till
it
became
necessary
for
the
sheriff
to
dislodge
him
by
violence
the
various
kinds
of
superstition
which
prevailed
here
as
in
all
other
regions
of
ignorance
are
by
the
diligence
of
the
ministers
almost
extirpated
of
browny
mentioned
by
martin
nothing
has
been
heard
for
many
years
browny
was
a
sturdy
fairy
who
if
he
was
fed
and
kindly
treated
would
as
they
said
do
a
great
deal
of
work
they
now
pay
him
no
wages
and
are
content
to
labour
for
themselves
in
troda
within
these
years
milk
was
put
every
saturday
for
greogach
or
old
man
with
the
long
beard
whether
greogach
was
courted
as
kind
or
dreaded
as
terrible
whether
they
meant
by
giving
him
the
milk
to
obtain
good
or
avert
evil
i
was
not
informed
the
minister
is
now
living
by
whom
the
practice
was
abolished
they
have
still
among
them
a
great
number
of
charms
for
the
cure
of
different
diseases
they
are
all
invocations
perhaps
transmitted
to
them
from
the
times
of
popery
which
increasing
knowledge
will
bring
into
disuse
they
have
opinions
which
can
not
be
ranked
with
superstition
because
they
regard
only
natural
effects
they
expect
better
crops
of
grain
by
sowing
their
seed
in
the
moon
increase
the
moon
has
great
influence
in
vulgar
philosophy
in
my
memory
it
was
a
precept
annually
given
in
one
of
the
english
almanacks
kill
hogs
when
the
moon
was
increasing
and
the
bacon
would
prove
the
better
in
boiling
we
should
have
had
little
claim
to
the
praise
of
curiosity
if
we
had
not
endeavoured
with
particular
attention
to
examine
the
question
of
the
second
sight
of
an
opinion
received
for
centuries
by
a
whole
nation
and
supposed
to
be
confirmed
through
its
whole
descent
by
a
series
of
successive
facts
it
is
desirable
that
the
truth
should
be
established
or
the
fallacy
detected
the
second
sight
is
an
impression
made
either
by
the
mind
upon
the
eye
or
by
the
eye
upon
the
mind
by
which
things
distant
or
future
are
perceived
and
seen
as
if
they
were
present
a
man
on
a
journey
far
from
home
falls
from
his
horse
another
who
is
perhaps
at
work
about
the
house
sees
him
bleeding
on
the
ground
commonly
with
a
landscape
of
the
place
where
the
accident
befalls
him
another
seer
driving
home
his
cattle
or
wandering
in
idleness
or
musing
in
the
sunshine
is
suddenly
surprised
by
the
appearance
of
a
bridal
ceremony
or
funeral
procession
and
counts
the
mourners
or
attendants
of
whom
if
he
knows
them
he
relates
the
names
if
he
knows
them
not
he
can
describe
the
dresses
things
distant
are
seen
at
the
instant
when
they
happen
of
things
future
i
know
not
that
there
is
any
rule
for
determining
the
time
between
the
sight
and
the
event
this
receptive
faculty
for
power
it
can
not
be
called
is
neither
voluntary
nor
constant
the
appearances
have
no
dependence
upon
choice
they
can
not
be
summoned
detained
or
recalled
the
impression
is
sudden
and
the
effect
often
painful
by
the
term
second
sight
seems
to
be
meant
a
mode
of
seeing
superadded
to
that
which
nature
generally
bestows
in
the
earse
it
is
called
taisch
which
signifies
likewise
a
spectre
or
a
vision
i
know
not
nor
is
it
likely
that
the
highlanders
ever
examined
whether
by
taisch
used
for
second
sight
they
mean
the
power
of
seeing
or
the
thing
seen
i
do
not
find
it
to
be
true
as
it
is
reported
that
to
the
second
sight
nothing
is
presented
but
phantoms
of
evil
good
seems
to
have
the
same
proportions
in
those
visionary
scenes
as
it
obtains
in
real
life
almost
all
remarkable
events
have
evil
for
their
basis
and
are
either
miseries
incurred
or
miseries
escaped
our
sense
is
so
much
stronger
of
what
we
suffer
than
of
what
we
enjoy
that
the
ideas
of
pain
predominate
in
almost
every
mind
what
is
recollection
but
a
revival
of
vexations
or
history
but
a
record
of
wars
treasons
and
calamities
death
which
is
considered
as
the
greatest
evil
happens
to
all
the
greatest
good
be
it
what
it
will
is
the
lot
but
of
a
part
that
they
should
often
see
death
is
to
be
expected
because
death
is
an
event
frequent
and
important
but
they
see
likewise
more
pleasing
incidents
a
gentleman
told
me
that
when
he
had
once
gone
far
from
his
own
island
one
of
his
labouring
servants
predicted
his
return
and
described
the
livery
of
his
attendant
which
he
had
never
worn
at
home
and
which
had
been
without
any
previous
design
occasionally
given
him
our
desire
of
information
was
keen
and
our
inquiry
frequent
boswell
frankness
and
gaiety
made
every
body
communicative
and
we
heard
many
tales
of
these
airy
shows
with
more
or
less
evidence
and
distinctness
it
is
the
common
talk
of
the
lowland
scots
that
the
notion
of
the
second
sight
is
wearing
away
with
other
superstitions
and
that
its
reality
is
no
longer
supposed
but
by
the
grossest
people
how
far
its
prevalence
ever
extended
or
what
ground
it
has
lost
i
know
not
the
islanders
of
all
degrees
whether
of
rank
or
understanding
universally
admit
it
except
the
ministers
who
universally
deny
it
and
are
suspected
to
deny
it
in
consequence
of
a
system
against
conviction
one
of
them
honestly
told
me
that
he
came
to
sky
with
a
resolution
not
to
believe
it
strong
reasons
for
incredulity
will
readily
occur
this
faculty
of
seeing
things
out
of
sight
is
local
and
commonly
useless
it
is
a
breach
of
the
common
order
of
things
without
any
visible
reason
or
perceptible
benefit
it
is
ascribed
only
to
a
people
very
little
enlightened
and
among
them
for
the
most
part
to
the
mean
and
the
ignorant
to
the
confidence
of
these
objections
it
may
be
replied
that
by
presuming
to
determine
what
is
fit
and
what
is
beneficial
they
presuppose
more
knowledge
of
the
universal
system
than
man
has
attained
and
therefore
depend
upon
principles
too
complicated
and
extensive
for
our
comprehension
and
that
there
can
be
no
security
in
the
consequence
when
the
premises
are
not
understood
that
the
second
sight
is
only
wonderful
because
it
is
rare
for
considered
in
itself
it
involves
no
more
difficulty
than
dreams
or
perhaps
than
the
regular
exercise
of
the
cogitative
faculty
that
a
general
opinion
of
communicative
impulses
or
visionary
representations
has
prevailed
in
all
ages
and
all
nations
that
particular
instances
have
been
given
with
such
evidence
as
neither
bacon
nor
bayle
has
been
able
to
resist
that
sudden
impressions
which
the
event
has
verified
have
been
felt
by
more
than
own
or
publish
them
that
the
second
sight
of
the
hebrides
implies
only
the
local
frequency
of
a
power
which
is
nowhere
totally
unknown
and
that
where
we
are
unable
to
decide
by
antecedent
reason
we
must
be
content
to
yield
to
the
force
of
testimony
by
pretension
to
second
sight
no
profit
was
ever
sought
or
gained
it
is
an
involuntary
affection
in
which
neither
hope
nor
fear
are
known
to
have
any
part
those
who
profess
to
feel
it
do
not
boast
of
it
as
a
privilege
nor
are
considered
by
others
as
advantageously
distinguished
they
have
no
temptation
to
feign
and
their
hearers
have
no
motive
to
encourage
the
imposture
to
talk
with
any
of
these
seers
is
not
easy
there
is
one
living
in
sky
with
whom
we
would
have
gladly
conversed
but
he
was
very
gross
and
ignorant
and
knew
no
english
the
proportion
in
these
countries
of
the
poor
to
the
rich
is
such
that
if
we
suppose
the
quality
to
be
accidental
it
can
very
rarely
happen
to
a
man
of
education
and
yet
on
such
men
it
has
sometimes
fallen
there
is
now
a
second
sighted
gentleman
in
the
highlands
who
complains
of
the
terrors
to
which
he
is
exposed
the
foresight
of
the
seers
is
not
always
prescience
they
are
impressed
with
images
of
which
the
event
only
shews
them
the
meaning
they
tell
what
they
have
seen
to
others
who
are
at
that
time
not
more
knowing
than
themselves
but
may
become
at
last
very
adequate
witnesses
by
comparing
the
narrative
with
its
verification
to
collect
sufficient
testimonies
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
publick
or
of
ourselves
would
have
required
more
time
than
we
could
bestow
there
is
against
it
the
seeming
analogy
of
things
confusedly
seen
and
little
understood
and
for
it
the
indistinct
cry
of
national
persuasion
which
may
be
perhaps
resolved
at
last
into
prejudice
and
tradition
i
never
could
advance
my
curiosity
to
conviction
but
came
away
at
last
only
willing
to
believe
as
there
subsists
no
longer
in
the
islands
much
of
that
peculiar
and
discriminative
form
of
life
of
which
the
idea
had
delighted
our
imagination
we
were
willing
to
listen
to
such
accounts
of
past
times
as
would
be
given
us
but
we
soon
found
what
memorials
were
to
be
expected
from
an
illiterate
people
whose
whole
time
is
a
series
of
distress
where
every
morning
is
labouring
with
expedients
for
the
evening
and
where
all
mental
pains
or
pleasure
arose
from
the
dread
of
winter
the
expectation
of
spring
the
caprices
of
their
chiefs
and
the
motions
of
the
neighbouring
clans
where
there
was
neither
shame
from
ignorance
nor
pride
in
knowledge
neither
curiosity
to
inquire
nor
vanity
to
communicate
the
chiefs
indeed
were
exempt
from
urgent
penury
and
daily
difficulties
and
in
their
houses
were
preserved
what
accounts
remained
of
past
ages
but
the
chiefs
were
sometimes
ignorant
and
careless
and
sometimes
kept
busy
by
turbulence
and
contention
and
one
generation
of
ignorance
effaces
the
whole
series
of
unwritten
history
books
are
faithful
repositories
which
may
be
a
while
neglected
or
forgotten
but
when
they
are
opened
again
will
again
impart
their
instruction
memory
once
interrupted
is
not
to
be
recalled
written
learning
is
a
fixed
luminary
which
after
the
cloud
that
had
hidden
it
has
past
away
is
again
bright
in
its
proper
station
tradition
is
but
a
meteor
which
if
once
it
falls
can
not
be
rekindled
it
seems
to
be
universally
supposed
that
much
of
the
local
history
was
preserved
by
the
bards
of
whom
one
is
said
to
have
been
retained
by
every
great
family
after
these
bards
were
some
of
my
first
inquiries
and
i
received
such
answers
as
for
a
while
made
me
please
myself
with
my
increase
of
knowledge
for
i
had
not
then
learned
how
to
estimate
the
narration
of
a
highlander
they
said
that
a
great
family
had
a
bard
and
a
senachi
who
were
the
poet
and
historian
of
the
house
and
an
old
gentleman
told
me
that
he
remembered
one
of
each
here
was
a
dawn
of
intelligence
of
men
that
had
lived
within
memory
some
certain
knowledge
might
be
attained
though
the
office
had
ceased
its
effects
might
continue
the
poems
might
be
found
though
there
was
no
poet
another
conversation
indeed
informed
me
that
the
same
man
was
both
bard
and
senachi
this
variation
discouraged
me
but
as
the
practice
might
be
different
in
different
times
or
at
the
same
time
in
different
families
there
was
yet
no
reason
for
supposing
that
i
must
necessarily
sit
down
in
total
ignorance
soon
after
i
was
told
by
a
gentleman
who
is
generally
acknowledged
the
greatest
master
of
hebridian
antiquities
that
there
had
indeed
once
been
both
bards
and
senachies
and
that
senachi
signified
man
of
talk
or
of
conversation
but
that
neither
bard
nor
senachi
had
existed
for
some
centuries
i
have
no
reason
to
suppose
it
exactly
known
at
what
time
the
custom
ceased
nor
did
it
probably
cease
in
all
houses
at
once
but
whenever
the
practice
of
recitation
was
disused
the
works
whether
poetical
or
historical
perished
with
the
authors
for
in
those
times
nothing
had
been
written
in
the
earse
language
whether
the
of
talk
was
a
historian
whose
office
was
to
tell
truth
or
a
like
those
which
were
in
the
last
century
and
perhaps
are
now
among
the
irish
whose
trade
was
only
to
amuse
it
now
would
be
vain
to
inquire
most
of
the
domestick
offices
were
i
believe
hereditary
and
probably
the
laureat
of
a
clan
was
always
the
son
of
the
last
laureat
the
history
of
the
race
could
no
otherwise
be
communicated
or
retained
but
what
genius
could
be
expected
in
a
poet
by
inheritance
the
nation
was
wholly
illiterate
neither
bards
nor
senachies
could
write
or
read
but
if
they
were
ignorant
there
was
no
danger
of
detection
they
were
believed
by
those
whose
vanity
they
flattered
the
recital
of
genealogies
which
has
been
considered
as
very
efficacious
to
the
preservation
of
a
true
series
of
ancestry
was
anciently
made
when
the
heir
of
the
family
came
to
manly
age
this
practice
has
never
subsisted
within
time
of
memory
nor
was
much
credit
due
to
such
rehearsers
who
might
obtrude
fictitious
pedigrees
either
to
please
their
masters
or
to
hide
the
deficiency
of
their
own
memories
where
the
chiefs
of
the
highlands
have
found
the
histories
of
their
descent
is
difficult
to
tell
for
no
earse
genealogy
was
ever
written
in
general
this
only
is
evident
that
the
principal
house
of
a
clan
must
be
very
ancient
and
that
those
must
have
lived
long
in
a
place
of
whom
it
is
not
known
when
they
came
thither
thus
hopeless
are
all
attempts
to
find
any
traces
of
highland
learning
nor
are
their
primitive
customs
and
ancient
manner
of
life
otherwise
than
very
faintly
and
uncertainly
remembered
by
the
present
race
the
peculiarities
which
strike
the
native
of
a
commercial
country
proceeded
in
a
great
measure
from
the
want
of
money
to
the
servants
and
dependents
that
were
not
domesticks
and
if
an
estimate
be
made
from
the
capacity
of
any
of
their
old
houses
which
i
have
seen
their
domesticks
could
have
been
but
few
were
appropriated
certain
portions
of
land
for
their
support
macdonald
has
a
piece
of
ground
yet
called
the
bards
or
senachies
field
when
a
beef
was
killed
for
the
house
particular
parts
were
claimed
as
fees
by
the
several
officers
or
workmen
what
was
the
right
of
each
i
have
not
learned
the
head
belonged
to
the
smith
and
the
udder
of
a
cow
to
the
piper
the
weaver
had
likewise
his
particular
part
and
so
many
pieces
followed
these
prescriptive
claims
that
the
laird
was
at
last
but
little
the
payment
of
rent
in
kind
has
been
so
long
disused
in
england
that
it
is
totally
forgotten
it
was
practised
very
lately
in
the
hebrides
and
probably
still
continues
not
only
in
kilda
where
money
is
not
yet
known
but
in
others
of
the
smaller
and
remoter
islands
it
were
perhaps
to
be
desired
that
no
change
in
this
particular
should
have
been
made
when
the
laird
could
only
eat
the
produce
of
his
lands
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
residing
upon
them
and
when
the
tenant
could
not
convert
his
stock
into
more
portable
riches
he
could
never
be
tempted
away
from
his
farm
from
the
only
place
where
he
could
be
wealthy
money
confounds
subordination
by
overpowering
the
distinctions
of
rank
and
birth
and
weakens
authority
by
supplying
power
of
resistance
or
expedients
for
escape
the
feudal
system
is
formed
for
a
nation
employed
in
agriculture
and
has
never
long
kept
its
hold
where
gold
and
silver
have
become
common
their
arms
were
anciently
the
glaymore
or
great
sword
and
afterwards
the
sword
and
target
or
buckler
which
was
sustained
on
the
left
arm
in
the
midst
of
the
target
which
was
made
of
wood
covered
with
leather
and
studded
with
nails
a
slender
lance
about
two
feet
long
was
sometimes
fixed
it
was
heavy
and
cumberous
and
accordingly
has
for
some
time
past
been
gradually
laid
aside
very
few
targets
were
at
culloden
the
dirk
or
broad
dagger
i
am
afraid
was
of
more
use
in
private
quarrels
than
in
battles
the
is
only
a
slight
alteration
of
the
old
english
bill
after
all
that
has
been
said
of
the
force
and
terrour
of
the
highland
sword
i
could
not
find
that
the
art
of
defence
was
any
part
of
common
education
the
gentlemen
were
perhaps
sometimes
skilful
gladiators
but
the
common
men
had
no
other
powers
than
those
of
violence
and
courage
yet
it
is
well
known
that
the
onset
of
the
highlanders
was
very
formidable
as
an
army
can
not
consist
of
philosophers
a
panick
is
easily
excited
by
any
unwonted
mode
of
annoyance
new
dangers
are
naturally
magnified
and
men
accustomed
only
to
exchange
bullets
at
a
distance
and
rather
to
hear
their
enemies
than
see
them
are
discouraged
and
amazed
when
they
find
themselves
encountered
hand
to
hand
and
catch
the
gleam
of
steel
flashing
in
their
faces
the
highland
weapons
gave
opportunity
for
many
exertions
of
personal
courage
and
sometimes
for
single
combats
in
the
field
like
those
which
occur
so
frequently
in
fabulous
wars
at
falkirk
a
gentleman
now
living
was
i
suppose
after
the
retreat
of
the
king
troops
engaged
at
a
distance
from
the
rest
with
an
irish
dragoon
they
were
both
skilful
swordsmen
and
the
contest
was
not
easily
decided
the
dragoon
at
last
had
the
advantage
and
the
highlander
called
for
quarter
but
quarter
was
refused
him
and
the
fight
continued
till
he
was
reduced
to
defend
himself
upon
his
knee
at
that
instant
one
of
the
macleods
came
to
his
rescue
who
as
it
is
said
offered
quarter
to
the
dragoon
but
he
thought
himself
obliged
to
reject
what
he
had
before
refused
and
as
battle
gives
little
time
to
deliberate
was
immediately
killed
funerals
were
formerly
solemnized
by
calling
multitudes
together
and
entertaining
them
at
great
expence
this
emulation
of
useless
cost
has
been
for
some
time
discouraged
and
at
last
in
the
isle
of
sky
is
almost
suppressed
of
the
earse
language
as
i
understand
nothing
i
can
not
say
more
than
i
have
been
told
it
is
the
rude
speech
of
a
barbarous
people
who
had
few
thoughts
to
express
and
were
content
as
they
conceived
grossly
to
be
grossly
understood
after
what
has
been
lately
talked
of
highland
bards
and
highland
genius
many
will
startle
when
they
are
told
that
the
earse
never
was
a
written
language
that
there
is
not
in
the
world
an
earse
manuscript
a
hundred
years
old
and
that
the
sounds
of
the
highlanders
were
never
expressed
by
letters
till
some
little
books
of
piety
were
translated
and
a
metrical
version
of
the
psalms
was
made
by
the
synod
of
argyle
whoever
therefore
now
writes
in
this
language
spells
according
to
his
own
perception
of
the
sound
and
his
own
idea
of
the
power
of
the
letters
the
welsh
and
the
irish
are
cultivated
tongues
the
welsh
two
hundred
years
ago
insulted
their
english
neighbours
for
the
instability
of
their
orthography
while
the
earse
merely
floated
in
the
breath
of
the
people
and
could
therefore
receive
little
improvement
when
a
language
begins
to
teem
with
books
it
is
tending
to
refinement
as
those
who
undertake
to
teach
others
must
have
undergone
some
labour
in
improving
themselves
they
set
a
proportionate
value
on
their
own
thoughts
and
wish
to
enforce
them
by
efficacious
expressions
speech
becomes
embodied
and
permanent
different
modes
and
phrases
are
compared
and
the
best
obtains
an
establishment
by
degrees
one
age
improves
upon
another
exactness
is
first
obtained
and
afterwards
elegance
but
diction
merely
vocal
is
always
in
its
childhood
as
no
man
leaves
his
eloquence
behind
him
the
new
generations
have
all
to
learn
there
may
possibly
be
books
without
a
polished
language
but
there
can
be
no
polished
language
without
books
that
the
bards
could
not
read
more
than
the
rest
of
their
countrymen
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
because
if
they
had
read
they
could
probably
have
written
and
how
high
their
compositions
may
reasonably
be
rated
an
inquirer
may
best
judge
by
considering
what
stores
of
imagery
what
principles
of
ratiocination
what
comprehension
of
knowledge
and
what
delicacy
of
elocution
he
has
known
any
man
attain
who
can
not
read
the
state
of
the
bards
was
yet
more
hopeless
he
that
can
not
read
may
now
converse
with
those
that
can
but
the
bard
was
a
barbarian
among
barbarians
who
knowing
nothing
himself
lived
with
others
that
knew
no
more
there
has
lately
been
in
the
islands
one
of
these
illiterate
poets
who
hearing
the
bible
read
at
church
is
said
to
have
turned
the
sacred
history
into
verse
i
heard
part
of
a
dialogue
composed
by
him
translated
by
a
young
lady
in
mull
and
thought
it
had
more
meaning
than
i
expected
from
a
man
totally
uneducated
but
he
had
some
opportunities
of
knowledge
he
lived
among
a
learned
people
after
all
that
has
been
done
for
the
instruction
of
the
highlanders
the
antipathy
between
their
language
and
literature
still
continues
and
no
man
that
has
learned
only
earse
is
at
this
time
able
to
read
the
earse
has
many
dialects
and
the
words
used
in
some
islands
are
not
always
known
in
others
in
literate
nations
though
the
pronunciation
and
sometimes
the
words
of
common
speech
may
differ
as
now
in
england
compared
with
the
south
of
scotland
yet
there
is
a
written
diction
which
pervades
all
dialects
and
is
understood
in
every
province
but
where
the
whole
language
is
colloquial
he
that
has
only
one
part
never
gets
the
rest
as
he
can
not
get
it
but
by
change
of
residence
in
an
unwritten
speech
nothing
that
is
not
very
short
is
transmitted
from
one
generation
to
another
few
have
opportunities
of
hearing
a
long
composition
often
enough
to
learn
it
or
have
inclination
to
repeat
it
so
often
as
is
necessary
to
retain
it
and
what
is
once
forgotten
is
lost
for
ever
i
believe
there
can
not
be
recovered
in
the
whole
earse
language
five
hundred
lines
of
which
there
is
any
evidence
to
prove
them
a
hundred
years
old
yet
i
hear
that
the
father
of
ossian
boasts
of
two
chests
more
of
ancient
poetry
which
he
suppresses
because
they
are
too
good
for
the
english
he
that
goes
into
the
highlands
with
a
mind
naturally
acquiescent
and
a
credulity
eager
for
wonders
may
come
back
with
an
opinion
very
different
from
mine
for
the
inhabitants
knowing
the
ignorance
of
all
strangers
in
their
language
and
antiquities
perhaps
are
not
very
scrupulous
adherents
to
truth
yet
i
do
not
say
that
they
deliberately
speak
studied
falsehood
or
have
a
settled
purpose
to
deceive
they
have
inquired
and
considered
little
and
do
not
always
feel
their
own
ignorance
they
are
not
much
accustomed
to
be
interrogated
by
others
and
seem
never
to
have
thought
upon
interrogating
themselves
so
that
if
they
do
not
know
what
they
tell
to
be
true
they
likewise
do
not
distinctly
perceive
it
to
be
false
boswell
was
very
diligent
in
his
inquiries
and
the
result
of
his
investigations
was
that
the
answer
to
the
second
question
was
commonly
such
as
nullified
the
answer
to
the
first
we
were
a
while
told
that
they
had
an
old
translation
of
the
scriptures
and
told
it
till
it
would
appear
obstinacy
to
inquire
again
yet
by
continued
accumulation
of
questions
we
found
that
the
translation
meant
if
any
meaning
there
were
was
nothing
else
than
the
irish
bible
we
heard
of
manuscripts
that
were
or
that
had
been
in
the
hands
of
somebody
father
or
grandfather
but
at
last
we
had
no
reason
to
believe
they
were
other
than
irish
martin
mentions
irish
but
never
any
earse
manuscripts
to
be
found
in
the
islands
in
his
time
i
suppose
my
opinion
of
the
poems
of
ossian
is
already
discovered
i
believe
they
never
existed
in
any
other
form
than
that
which
we
have
seen
the
editor
or
author
never
could
shew
the
original
nor
can
it
be
shewn
by
any
other
to
revenge
reasonable
incredulity
by
refusing
evidence
is
a
degree
of
insolence
with
which
the
world
is
not
yet
acquainted
and
stubborn
audacity
is
the
last
refuge
of
guilt
it
would
be
easy
to
shew
it
if
he
had
it
but
whence
could
it
be
had
it
is
too
long
to
be
remembered
and
the
language
formerly
had
nothing
written
he
has
doubtless
inserted
names
that
circulate
in
popular
stories
and
may
have
translated
some
wandering
ballads
if
any
can
be
found
and
the
names
and
some
of
the
images
being
recollected
make
an
inaccurate
auditor
imagine
by
the
help
of
caledonian
bigotry
that
he
has
formerly
heard
the
whole
i
asked
a
very
learned
minister
in
sky
who
had
used
all
arts
to
make
me
believe
the
genuineness
of
the
book
whether
at
last
he
believed
it
himself
but
he
would
not
answer
he
wished
me
to
be
deceived
for
the
honour
of
his
country
but
would
not
directly
and
formally
deceive
me
yet
has
this
man
testimony
been
publickly
produced
as
of
one
that
held
fingal
to
be
the
work
of
ossian
it
is
said
that
some
men
of
integrity
profess
to
have
heard
parts
of
it
but
they
all
heard
them
when
they
were
boys
and
it
was
never
said
that
any
of
them
could
recite
six
lines
they
remember
names
and
perhaps
some
proverbial
sentiments
and
having
no
distinct
ideas
coin
a
resemblance
without
an
original
the
persuasion
of
the
scots
however
is
far
from
universal
and
in
a
question
so
capable
of
proof
why
should
doubt
be
suffered
to
continue
the
editor
has
been
heard
to
say
that
part
of
the
poem
was
received
by
him
in
the
saxon
character
he
has
then
found
by
some
peculiar
fortune
an
unwritten
language
written
in
a
character
which
the
natives
probably
never
beheld
i
have
yet
supposed
no
imposture
but
in
the
publisher
yet
i
am
far
from
certainty
that
some
translations
have
not
been
lately
made
that
may
now
be
obtruded
as
parts
of
the
original
work
credulity
on
one
part
is
a
strong
temptation
to
deceit
on
the
other
especially
to
deceit
of
which
no
personal
injury
is
the
consequence
and
which
flatters
the
author
with
his
own
ingenuity
the
scots
have
something
to
plead
for
their
easy
reception
of
an
improbable
fiction
they
are
seduced
by
their
fondness
for
their
supposed
ancestors
a
scotchman
must
be
a
very
sturdy
moralist
who
does
not
love
scotland
better
than
truth
he
will
always
love
it
better
than
inquiry
and
if
falsehood
flatters
his
vanity
will
not
be
very
diligent
to
detect
it
neither
ought
the
english
to
be
much
influenced
by
scotch
authority
for
of
the
past
and
present
state
of
the
whole
earse
nation
the
lowlanders
are
at
least
as
ignorant
as
ourselves
to
be
ignorant
is
painful
but
it
is
dangerous
to
quiet
our
uneasiness
by
the
delusive
opiate
of
hasty
persuasion
but
this
is
the
age
in
which
those
who
could
not
read
have
been
supposed
to
write
in
which
the
giants
of
antiquated
romance
have
been
exhibited
as
realities
if
we
know
little
of
the
ancient
highlanders
let
us
not
fill
the
vacuity
with
ossian
if
we
had
not
searched
the
magellanick
regions
let
us
however
forbear
to
people
them
with
patagons
having
waited
some
days
at
armidel
we
were
flattered
at
last
with
a
wind
that
promised
to
convey
us
to
mull
we
went
on
board
a
boat
that
was
taking
in
kelp
and
left
the
isle
of
sky
behind
us
we
were
doomed
to
experience
like
others
the
danger
of
trusting
to
the
wind
which
blew
against
us
in
a
short
time
with
such
violence
that
we
being
no
seasoned
sailors
were
willing
to
call
it
a
tempest
i
was
and
lay
down
boswell
kept
the
deck
the
master
knew
not
well
whither
to
go
and
our
difficulties
might
perhaps
have
filled
a
very
pathetick
page
had
not
maclean
of
col
who
with
every
other
qualification
which
insular
life
requires
is
a
very
active
and
skilful
mariner
piloted
us
safe
into
his
own
harbour
col
in
the
morning
we
found
ourselves
under
the
isle
of
col
where
we
landed
and
passed
the
first
day
and
night
with
captain
maclean
a
gentleman
who
has
lived
some
time
in
the
east
indies
but
having
dethroned
no
nabob
is
not
too
rich
to
settle
in
own
country
next
day
the
wind
was
fair
and
we
might
have
had
an
easy
passage
to
mull
but
having
contrarily
to
our
own
intention
landed
upon
a
new
island
we
would
not
leave
it
wholly
unexamined
we
therefore
suffered
the
vessel
to
depart
without
us
and
trusted
the
skies
for
another
wind
maclean
of
col
having
a
very
numerous
family
has
for
some
time
past
resided
at
aberdeen
that
he
may
superintend
their
education
and
leaves
the
young
gentleman
our
friend
to
govern
his
dominions
with
the
full
power
of
a
highland
chief
by
the
absence
of
the
laird
family
our
entertainment
was
made
more
difficult
because
the
house
was
in
a
great
degree
disfurnished
but
young
col
kindness
and
activity
supplied
all
defects
and
procured
us
more
than
sufficient
accommodation
here
i
first
mounted
a
little
highland
steed
and
if
there
had
been
many
spectators
should
have
been
somewhat
ashamed
of
my
figure
in
the
march
the
horses
of
the
islands
as
of
other
barren
countries
are
very
low
they
are
indeed
musculous
and
strong
beyond
what
their
size
gives
reason
for
expecting
but
a
bulky
man
upon
one
of
their
backs
makes
a
very
disproportionate
appearance
from
the
habitation
of
captain
maclean
we
went
to
grissipol
but
called
by
the
way
on
hector
maclean
the
minister
of
col
whom
we
found
in
a
hut
that
is
a
house
of
only
one
floor
but
with
windows
and
chimney
and
not
inelegantly
furnished
maclean
has
the
reputation
of
great
learning
he
is
years
old
but
not
infirm
with
a
look
of
venerable
dignity
excelling
what
i
remember
in
any
other
man
his
conversation
was
not
unsuitable
to
his
appearance
i
lost
some
of
his
by
treating
a
heretical
writer
with
more
regard
than
in
his
opinion
a
heretick
could
deserve
i
honoured
his
orthodoxy
and
did
not
much
censure
his
asperity
a
man
who
has
settled
his
opinions
does
not
love
to
have
the
tranquillity
of
his
conviction
disturbed
and
at
it
is
time
to
be
in
earnest
mention
was
made
of
the
earse
translation
of
the
new
testament
which
has
been
lately
published
and
of
which
the
learned
macqueen
of
sky
spoke
with
commendation
but
maclean
said
he
did
not
use
it
because
he
could
make
the
text
more
intelligible
to
his
auditors
by
an
extemporary
version
from
this
i
inferred
that
the
language
of
the
translation
was
not
the
language
of
the
isle
of
col
he
has
no
publick
edifice
for
the
exercise
of
his
ministry
and
can
officiate
to
no
greater
number
than
a
room
can
contain
and
the
room
of
a
hut
is
not
very
large
this
is
all
the
opportunity
of
worship
that
is
now
granted
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
some
of
whom
must
travel
thither
perhaps
ten
miles
two
chapels
were
erected
by
their
ancestors
of
which
i
saw
the
skeletons
which
now
stand
faithful
witnesses
of
the
triumph
of
the
reformation
the
want
of
churches
is
not
the
only
impediment
to
piety
there
is
likewise
a
want
of
ministers
a
parish
often
contains
more
islands
than
one
and
each
island
can
have
the
minister
only
in
its
own
turn
at
raasa
they
had
i
think
a
right
to
service
only
every
third
sunday
all
the
provision
made
by
the
present
ecclesiastical
constitution
for
the
inhabitants
of
about
a
hundred
square
miles
is
a
prayer
and
sermon
in
a
little
room
once
in
three
weeks
and
even
this
parsimonious
distribution
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
weather
and
in
those
islands
where
the
minister
does
not
reside
it
is
impossible
to
tell
how
many
weeks
or
months
may
pass
without
any
publick
exercise
of
religion
grissipol
in
col
after
a
short
conversation
with
maclean
we
went
on
to
grissipol
a
house
and
farm
tenanted
by
macsweyn
where
i
saw
more
of
the
ancient
life
of
a
highlander
than
i
had
yet
found
macsweyn
could
speak
no
english
and
had
never
seen
any
other
places
than
the
islands
of
sky
mull
and
col
but
she
was
hospitable
and
and
spread
her
table
with
sufficient
liberality
we
found
tea
here
as
in
every
other
place
but
our
spoons
were
of
horn
the
house
of
grissipol
stands
by
a
brook
very
clear
and
quick
which
is
i
suppose
one
of
the
most
copious
streams
in
the
island
this
place
was
the
scene
of
an
action
much
celebrated
in
the
traditional
history
of
col
but
which
probably
no
two
relaters
will
tell
alike
some
time
in
the
obscure
ages
macneil
of
barra
married
the
lady
maclean
who
had
the
isle
of
col
for
her
jointure
whether
macneil
detained
col
when
the
widow
was
dead
or
whether
she
lived
so
long
as
to
make
her
heirs
impatient
is
perhaps
not
now
known
the
younger
son
called
john
gerves
or
john
the
giant
a
man
of
great
strength
who
was
then
in
ireland
either
for
safety
or
for
education
dreamed
of
recovering
his
inheritance
and
getting
some
adventurers
together
which
in
those
unsettled
times
was
not
hard
to
do
invaded
col
he
was
driven
away
but
was
not
discouraged
and
collecting
new
followers
in
three
years
came
again
with
fifty
men
in
his
way
he
stopped
at
artorinish
in
morvern
where
his
uncle
was
prisoner
to
macleod
and
was
then
with
his
enemies
in
a
tent
maclean
took
with
him
only
one
servant
whom
he
ordered
to
stay
at
the
outside
and
where
he
should
see
the
tent
pressed
outwards
to
strike
with
his
dirk
it
being
the
intention
of
maclean
as
any
man
provoked
him
to
lay
hands
upon
him
and
push
him
back
he
entered
the
tent
alone
with
his
in
his
hand
and
struck
such
terror
into
the
whole
assembly
that
they
dismissed
his
uncle
when
he
landed
at
col
he
saw
the
sentinel
who
kept
watch
towards
the
sea
running
off
to
grissipol
to
give
macneil
who
was
there
with
a
hundred
and
twenty
men
an
account
of
the
invasion
he
told
macgill
one
of
his
followers
that
if
he
intercepted
that
dangerous
intelligence
by
catching
the
courier
he
would
give
him
certain
lands
in
mull
upon
this
promise
macgill
pursued
the
messenger
and
either
killed
or
stopped
him
and
his
posterity
till
very
lately
held
the
lands
in
mull
the
alarm
being
thus
prevented
he
came
unexpectedly
upon
macneil
chiefs
were
in
those
days
never
wholly
unprovided
for
an
enemy
a
fight
ensued
in
which
one
of
their
followers
is
said
to
have
given
an
extraordinary
proof
of
activity
by
bounding
backwards
over
the
brook
of
grissipol
macneil
being
killed
and
many
of
his
clan
destroyed
maclean
took
possession
of
the
island
which
the
macneils
attempted
to
conquer
by
another
invasion
but
were
defeated
and
repulsed
maclean
in
his
turn
invaded
the
estate
of
the
macneils
took
the
castle
of
brecacig
and
conquered
the
isle
of
barra
which
he
held
for
seven
years
and
then
restored
it
to
the
heirs
castle
of
col
from
grissipol
maclean
conducted
us
to
his
father
seat
a
neat
new
house
erected
near
the
old
castle
i
think
by
the
last
proprietor
here
we
were
allowed
to
take
our
station
and
lived
very
commodiously
while
we
waited
for
moderate
weather
and
a
fair
wind
which
we
did
not
so
soon
obtain
but
we
had
time
to
get
some
information
of
the
present
state
of
col
partly
by
inquiry
and
partly
by
occasional
excursions
col
is
computed
to
be
thirteen
miles
in
length
and
three
in
breadth
both
the
ends
are
the
property
of
the
duke
of
argyle
but
the
middle
belongs
to
maclean
who
is
called
col
as
the
only
laird
col
is
not
properly
rocky
it
is
rather
one
continued
rock
of
a
surface
much
diversified
with
protuberances
and
covered
with
a
thin
layer
of
earth
which
is
often
broken
and
discovers
the
stone
such
a
soil
is
not
for
plants
that
strike
deep
roots
and
perhaps
in
the
whole
island
nothing
has
ever
yet
grown
to
the
height
of
a
table
the
uncultivated
parts
are
clothed
with
heath
among
which
industry
has
interspersed
spots
of
grass
and
corn
but
no
attempt
has
yet
been
made
to
raise
a
tree
young
col
who
has
a
very
laudable
desire
of
improving
his
patrimony
purposes
some
time
to
plant
an
orchard
which
if
it
be
sheltered
by
a
wall
may
perhaps
succeed
he
has
introduced
the
culture
of
turnips
of
which
he
has
a
field
where
the
whole
work
was
performed
by
his
own
hand
his
intention
is
to
provide
food
for
his
cattle
in
the
winter
this
innovation
was
considered
by
macsweyn
as
the
idle
project
of
a
young
head
heated
with
english
fancies
but
he
has
now
found
that
turnips
will
really
grow
and
that
hungry
sheep
and
cows
will
really
eat
them
by
such
acquisitions
as
these
the
hebrides
may
in
time
rise
above
their
annual
distress
wherever
heath
will
grow
there
is
reason
to
think
something
better
may
draw
nourishment
and
by
trying
the
production
of
other
places
plants
will
be
found
suitable
to
every
soil
col
has
many
lochs
some
of
which
have
trouts
and
eels
and
others
have
never
yet
been
stocked
another
proof
of
the
negligence
of
the
islanders
who
might
take
fish
in
the
inland
waters
when
they
can
not
go
to
sea
their
quadrupeds
are
horses
cows
sheep
and
goats
they
have
neither
deer
hares
nor
rabbits
they
have
no
vermin
except
rats
which
have
been
lately
brought
thither
by
sea
as
to
other
places
and
are
free
from
serpents
frogs
and
toads
the
harvest
in
col
and
in
lewis
is
ripe
sooner
than
in
sky
and
the
winter
in
col
is
never
cold
but
very
tempestuous
i
know
not
that
i
ever
heard
the
wind
so
loud
in
any
other
place
and
boswell
observed
that
its
noise
was
all
its
own
for
there
were
no
trees
to
increase
it
noise
is
not
the
worst
effect
of
the
tempests
for
they
have
thrown
the
sand
from
the
shore
over
a
considerable
part
of
the
land
and
it
is
said
still
to
encroach
and
destroy
more
and
more
pasture
but
i
am
not
of
opinion
that
by
any
surveys
or
landmarks
its
limits
have
been
ever
fixed
or
its
progression
ascertained
if
one
man
has
confidence
enough
to
say
that
it
advances
nobody
can
bring
any
proof
to
support
him
in
denying
it
the
reason
why
it
is
not
spread
to
a
greater
extent
seems
to
be
that
the
wind
and
rain
come
almost
together
and
that
it
is
made
close
and
heavy
by
the
wet
before
the
storms
can
put
it
in
motion
so
thick
is
the
bed
and
so
small
the
particles
that
if
a
traveller
should
be
caught
by
a
sudden
gust
in
dry
weather
he
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
escape
with
life
for
natural
curiosities
i
was
shown
only
two
great
masses
of
stone
which
lie
loose
upon
the
ground
one
on
the
top
of
a
hill
and
the
other
at
a
small
distance
from
the
bottom
they
certainly
were
never
put
into
their
present
places
by
human
strength
or
skill
and
though
an
earthquake
might
have
broken
off
the
lower
stone
and
rolled
it
into
the
valley
no
account
can
be
given
of
the
other
which
lies
on
the
hill
unless
which
i
forgot
to
examine
there
be
still
near
it
some
higher
rock
from
which
it
might
be
torn
all
nations
have
a
tradition
that
their
earliest
ancestors
were
giants
and
these
stones
are
said
to
have
been
thrown
up
and
down
by
a
giant
and
his
mistress
there
are
so
many
more
important
things
of
which
human
knowledge
can
give
no
account
that
it
may
be
forgiven
us
if
we
speculate
no
longer
on
two
stones
in
col
this
island
is
very
populous
about
years
ago
the
fencible
men
of
col
were
reckoned
one
hundred
and
forty
which
is
the
sixth
of
eight
hundred
and
forty
and
probably
some
contrived
to
be
left
out
of
the
list
the
minister
told
us
that
a
few
years
ago
the
inhabitants
were
eight
hundred
between
the
ages
of
seven
and
of
seventy
round
numbers
are
seldom
exact
but
in
this
case
the
authority
is
good
and
the
errour
likely
to
be
little
if
to
the
eight
hundred
be
added
what
the
laws
of
computation
require
they
will
be
increased
to
at
least
a
thousand
and
if
the
dimensions
of
the
country
have
been
accurately
related
every
mile
maintains
more
than
this
proportion
of
habitation
is
greater
than
the
appearance
of
the
country
seems
to
admit
for
wherever
the
eye
wanders
it
sees
much
waste
and
little
cultivation
i
am
more
inclined
to
extend
the
land
of
which
no
measure
has
ever
been
taken
than
to
diminish
the
people
who
have
been
really

let
it
be
supposed
that
a
computed
mile
contains
a
mile
and
a
half
as
was
commonly
found
true
in
the
mensuration
of
the
english
roads
and
we
shall
then
allot
nearly
twelve
to
a
mile
which
agrees
much
better
with
ocular
observation
here
as
in
sky
and
other
islands
are
the
laird
the
tacksmen
and
the
under
tenants
maclean
the
laird
has
very
extensive
possessions
being
proprietor
not
only
of
far
the
greater
part
of
col
but
of
the
extensive
island
of
rum
and
a
very
considerable
territory
in
mull
rum
is
one
of
the
larger
islands
almost
square
and
therefore
of
great
capacity
in
proportion
to
its
sides
by
the
usual
method
of
estimating
computed
extent
it
may
contain
more
than
a
hundred
and
twenty
square
miles
it
originally
belonged
to
clanronald
and
was
purchased
by
col
who
in
some
dispute
about
the
bargain
made
clanronald
prisoner
and
kept
him
nine
months
in
confinement
its
owner
represents
it
as
mountainous
rugged
and
barren
in
the
hills
there
are
red
deer
the
horses
are
very
small
but
of
a
breed
eminent
for
beauty
col
not
long
ago
bought
one
of
them
from
a
tenant
who
told
him
that
as
he
was
of
a
shape
uncommonly
elegant
he
could
not
sell
him
but
at
a
high
price
and
that
whoever
had
him
should
pay
a
guinea
and
a
half
there
are
said
to
be
in
barra
a
race
of
horses
yet
smaller
of
which
the
highest
is
not
above
inches
the
rent
of
rum
is
not
great
maclean
declared
that
he
should
be
very
rich
if
he
could
set
his
land
at
halfpenny
an
acre
the
inhabitants
are
families
who
continued
papists
for
some
time
after
the
laird
became
a
protestant
their
adherence
to
their
old
religion
was
strengthened
by
the
countenance
of
the
laird
sister
a
zealous
romanist
till
one
sunday
as
they
were
going
to
mass
under
the
conduct
of
their
patroness
maclean
met
them
on
the
way
gave
one
of
them
a
blow
on
the
head
with
a
yellow
stick
i
suppose
a
cane
for
which
the
earse
had
no
name
and
drove
them
to
the
kirk
from
which
they
have
never
since
departed
since
the
use
of
this
method
of
conversion
the
inhabitants
of
egg
and
canna
who
continue
papists
call
the
protestantism
of
rum
the
religion
of
the
yellow
stick
the
only
popish
islands
are
egg
and
canna
egg
is
the
principal
island
of
a
parish
in
which
though
he
has
no
congregation
the
protestant
minister
resides
i
have
heard
of
nothing
curious
in
it
but
the
cave
in
which
a
former
generation
of
the
islanders
were
smothered
by
macleod
if
we
had
travelled
with
more
leisure
it
had
not
been
fit
to
have
neglected
the
popish
islands
popery
is
favourable
to
ceremony
and
among
ignorant
nations
ceremony
is
the
only
preservative
of
tradition
since
protestantism
was
extended
to
the
savage
parts
of
scotland
it
has
perhaps
been
one
of
the
chief
labours
of
the
ministers
to
abolish
stated
observances
because
they
continued
the
remembrance
of
the
former
religion
we
therefore
who
came
to
hear
old
traditions
and
see
antiquated
manners
should
probably
have
found
them
amongst
the
papists
canna
the
other
popish
island
belongs
to
clanronald
it
is
said
not
to
comprise
more
than
twelve
miles
of
land
and
yet
maintains
as
many
inhabitants
as
rum
we
were
at
col
under
the
protection
of
the
young
laird
without
any
of
the
distresses
which
pennant
in
a
fit
of
simple
credulity
seems
to
think
almost
worthy
of
an
elegy
by
ossian
wherever
we
roved
we
were
pleased
to
see
the
reverence
with
which
his
subjects
regarded
him
he
did
not
endeavour
to
dazzle
them
by
any
magnificence
of
dress
his
only
distinction
was
a
feather
in
his
bonnet
but
as
soon
as
he
appeared
they
forsook
their
work
and
clustered
about
him
he
took
them
by
the
hand
and
they
seemed
mutually
delighted
he
has
the
proper
disposition
of
a
chieftain
and
seems
desirous
to
continue
the
customs
of
his
house
the
bagpiper
played
regularly
when
dinner
was
served
whose
person
and
dress
made
a
good
appearance
and
he
brought
no
disgrace
upon
the
family
of
rankin
which
has
long
supplied
the
lairds
of
col
with
hereditary
musick
the
tacksmen
of
col
seem
to
live
with
less
dignity
and
convenience
than
those
of
sky
where
they
had
good
houses
and
tables
not
only
plentiful
but
delicate
in
col
only
two
houses
pay
the
window
tax
for
only
two
have
six
windows
which
i
suppose
are
the
laird
and
macsweyn
the
rents
have
till
within
seven
years
been
paid
in
kind
but
the
tenants
finding
that
cattle
and
corn
varied
in
their
price
desired
for
the
future
to
give
their
landlord
money
which
not
having
yet
arrived
at
the
philosophy
of
commerce
they
consider
as
being
every
year
of
the
same
value
we
were
told
of
a
particular
mode
of
the
tacksman
admits
some
of
his
inferior
neighbours
to
the
cultivation
of
his
grounds
on
condition
that
performing
all
the
work
and
giving
a
third
part
of
the
seed
they
shall
keep
a
certain
number
of
cows
sheep
and
goats
and
reap
a
third
part
of
the
harvest
thus
by
less
than
the
tillage
of
two
acres
they
pay
the
rent
of
one
there
are
tenants
below
the
rank
of
tacksmen
that
have
got
smaller
tenants
under
them
for
in
every
place
where
money
is
not
the
general
equivalent
there
must
be
some
whose
labour
is
immediately
paid
by
daily
food
a
country
that
has
no
money
is
by
no
means
convenient
for
beggars
both
because
such
countries
are
commonly
poor
and
because
charity
requires
some
trouble
and
some
thought
a
penny
is
easily
given
upon
the
first
impulse
of
compassion
or
impatience
of
importunity
but
few
will
deliberately
search
their
cupboards
or
their
granaries
to
find
out
something
to
give
a
penny
is
likewise
easily
spent
but
victuals
if
they
are
unprepared
require
houseroom
and
fire
and
utensils
which
the
beggar
knows
not
where
to
find
yet
beggars
there
sometimes
are
who
wander
from
island
to
island
we
had
in
our
passage
to
mull
the
company
of
a
woman
and
her
child
who
had
exhausted
the
charity
of
col
the
arrival
of
a
beggar
on
an
island
is
accounted
a
sinistrous
event
every
body
considers
that
he
shall
have
the
less
for
what
he
gives
away
their
alms
i
believe
is
generally
oatmeal
near
to
col
is
another
island
called
tireye
eminent
for
its
fertility
though
it
has
but
half
the
extent
of
rum
it
is
so
well
peopled
that
there
have
appeared
not
long
ago
nine
hundred
and
fourteen
at
a
funeral
the
plenty
of
this
island
enticed
beggars
to
it
who
seemed
so
burdensome
to
the
inhabitants
that
a
formal
compact
was
drawn
up
by
which
they
obliged
themselves
to
grant
no
more
relief
to
casual
wanderers
because
they
had
among
them
an
indigent
woman
of
high
birth
whom
they
considered
as
entitled
to
all
that
they
could
spare
i
have
read
the
stipulation
which
was
indited
with
juridical
formality
but
was
never
made
valid
by
regular
subscription
if
the
inhabitants
of
col
have
nothing
to
give
it
is
not
that
they
are
oppressed
by
their
landlord
their
leases
seem
to
be
very
profitable
one
farmer
who
pays
only
seven
pounds

maintained
seven
daughters

three
sons

here
in
some
respects
improved
beyond
the
condition
of
some
other
islands
in
sky
what
is
wanted
can
only
be
bought
as
the
arrival
of
some
wandering
pedlar
may
afford
an
opportunity
but
in
col
there
is
a
standing
shop
and
in
mull
there
are
two
a
shop
in
the
islands
as
in
other
places
of
little
frequentation
is
a
repository
of
every
thing
requisite
for
common
use
boswell
journal
was
filled
and
he
bought
some
paper
in
to
a
man
that
ranges
the
streets
of
london
where
he
is
tempted
to
contrive
wants
for
the
pleasure
of
supplying
them
a
shop
affords
no
image
worthy
of
attention
but
in
an
island
it
turns
the
balance
of
existence
between
good
and
evil
to
live
in
perpetual
want
of
little
things
is
a
state
not
indeed
of
torture
but
of
constant
vexation
i
have
in
sky
had
some
difficulty
to
find
ink
for
a
letter
and
if
a
woman
breaks
her
needle
the
work
is
at
a
stop
as
it
is
the
islanders
are
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
succedaneous
means
for
many
common
purposes
i
have
seen
the
chief
man
of
a
very
wide
district
riding
with
a
halter
for
a
bridle
and
governing
his
hobby
with
a
wooden
curb
the
people
of
col
however
do
not
want
dexterity
to
supply
some
of
their
necessities
several
arts
which
make
trades
and
demand
apprenticeships
in
great
cities
are
here
the
practices
of
daily
economy
in
every
house
candles
are
made
both
moulded
and
dipped
their
wicks
are
small
shreds
of
linen
cloth
they
all
know
how
to
extract
from
the
cuddy
oil
for
their
lamps
they
all
tan
skins
and
make
brogues
as
we
travelled
through
sky
we
saw
many
cottages
but
they
very
frequently
stood
single
on
the
naked
ground
in
col
where
the
hills
opened
a
place
convenient
for
habitation
we
found
a
petty
village
of
which
every
hut
had
a
little
garden
adjoining
thus
they
made
an
appearance
of
social
commerce
and
mutual
offices
and
of
some
attention
to
convenience
and
future
supply
there
is
not
in
the
western
islands
any
collection
of
buildings
that
can
make
pretensions
to
be
called
a
town
except
in
the
isle
of
lewis
which
i
have
not
seen
if
lewis
is
distinguished
by
a
town
col
has
also
something
peculiar
the
young
laird
has
attempted
what
no
islander
perhaps
ever
thought
on
he
has
begun
a
road
capable
of
a
he
has
carried
it
about
a
mile
and
will
continue
it
by
annual
elongation
from
his
house
to
the
harbour
of
taxes
here
is
no
reason
for
complaining
they
are
paid
by
a
very
easy
composition
the
for
col
is
twenty
shillings
whisky
is
very
plentiful
there
are
several
stills
in
the
island
and
more
is
made
than
the
inhabitants
consume
the
great
business
of
insular
policy
is
now
to
keep
the
people
in
their
own
country
as
the
world
has
been
let
in
upon
them
they
have
heard
of
happier
climates
and
less
arbitrary
government
and
if
they
are
disgusted
have
emissaries
among
them
ready
to
offer
them
land
and
houses
as
a
reward
for
deserting
their
chief
and
clan
many
have
departed
both
from
the
main
of
scotland
and
from
the
islands
and
all
that
go
may
be
considered
as
subjects
lost
to
the
british
crown
for
a
nation
scattered
in
the
boundless
regions
of
america
resembles
rays
diverging
from
a
focus
all
the
rays
remain
but
the
heat
is
gone
their
power
consisted
in
their
concentration
when
they
are
dispersed
they
have
no
effect
it
may
be
thought
that
they
are
happier
by
the
change
but
they
are
not
happy
as
a
nation
for
they
are
a
nation
no
longer
as
they
contribute
not
to
the
prosperity
of
any
community
they
must
want
that
security
that
dignity
that
happiness
whatever
it
be
which
a
prosperous
community
throws
back
upon
individuals
the
inhabitants
of
col
have
not
yet
learned
to
be
weary
of
their
heath
and
rocks
but
attend
their
agriculture
and
their
dairies
without
listening
to
american
seducements
there
are
some
however
who
think
that
this
emigration
has
raised
terrour
disproportionate
to
its
real
evil
and
that
it
is
only
a
new
mode
of
doing
what
was
always
done
the
highlands
they
say
never
maintained
their
natural
inhabitants
but
the
people
when
they
found
themselves
too
numerous
instead
of
extending
cultivation
provided
for
themselves
by
a
more
compendious
method
and
sought
better
fortune
in
other
countries
they
did
not
indeed
go
away
in
collective
bodies
but
withdrew
invisibly
a
few
at
a
time
but
the
whole
number
of
fugitives
was
not
less
and
the
difference
between
other
times
and
this
is
only
the
same
as
between
evaporation
and
effusion
this
is
plausible
but
i
am
afraid
it
is
not
true
those
who
went
before
if
they
were
not
sensibly
missed
as
the
argument
supposes
must
have
gone
either
in
less
number
or
in
a
manner
less
detrimental
than
at
present
because
formerly
there
was
no
complaint
those
who
then
left
the
country
were
generally
the
idle
dependants
on
overburdened
families
or
men
who
had
no
property
and
therefore
carried
away
only
themselves
in
the
present
eagerness
of
emigration
families
and
almost
communities
go
away
together
those
who
were
considered
as
prosperous
and
wealthy
sell
their
stock
and
carry
away
the
money
once
none
went
away
but
the
useless
and
poor
in
some
parts
there
is
now
reason
to
fear
that
none
will
stay
but
those
who
are
too
poor
to
remove
themselves
and
too
useless
to
be
removed
at
the
cost
of
others
of
antiquity
there
is
not
more
knowledge
in
col
than
in
other
places
but
every
where
something
may
be
gleaned
how
ladies
were
portioned
when
there
was
no
money
it
would
be
difficult
for
an
englishman
to
guess
in
maclean
of
dronart
in
mull
married
his
sister
fingala
to
maclean
of
coll
with
a
hundred
and
eighty
kine
and
stipulated
that
if
she
became
a
widow
her
jointure
should
be
three
hundred
and
sixty
i
suppose
some
proportionate
tract
of
land
was
appropriated
to
their
pasturage
the
disposition
to
pompous
and
expensive
funerals
which
has
at
one
time
or
other
prevailed
in
most
parts
of
the
civilized
world
is
not
yet
suppressed
in
the
islands
though
some
of
the
ancient
solemnities
are
worn
away
and
singers
are
no
longer
hired
to
attend
the
procession
nineteen
years
ago
at
the
burial
of
the
laird
of
col
were
killed
thirty
cows
and
about
fifty
sheep
the
number
of
the
cows
is
positively
told
and
we
must
suppose
other
victuals
in
like
proportion
maclean
informed
us
of
an
odd
game
of
which
he
did
not
tell
the
original
but
which
may
perhaps
be
used
in
other
places
where
the
reason
of
it
is
not
yet
forgot
at
eve
in
the
hall
or
castle
of
the
laird
where
at
festal
seasons
there
may
be
supposed
a
very
numerous
company
one
man
dresses
himself
in
a
cow
hide
upon
which
other
men
beat
with
sticks
he
runs
with
all
this
noise
round
the
house
which
all
the
company
quits
in
a
counterfeited
fright
the
door
is
then
shut
at
eve
there
is
no
great
pleasure
to
be
had
out
of
doors
in
the
hebrides
they
are
sure
soon
to
recover
from
their
terrour
enough
to
solicit
for
which
for
the
honour
of
poetry
is
not
to
be
obtained
but
by
repeating
a
verse
with
which
those
that
are
knowing
and
provident
take
care
to
be
furnished
very
near
the
house
of
maclean
stands
the
castle
of
col
which
was
the
mansion
of
the
laird
till
the
house
was
built
it
is
built
upon
a
rock
as
boswell
remarked
that
it
might
not
be
mined
it
is
very
strong
and
having
been
not
long
uninhabited
is
yet
in
repair
on
the
wall
was
not
long
ago
a
stone
with
an
inscription
importing
that
any
man
of
the
clan
of
maclonich
shall
appear
before
this
castle
though
he
come
at
midnight
with
a
man
head
in
his
hand
he
shall
there
find
safety
and
protection
against
all
but
the
king
this
is
an
old
highland
treaty
made
upon
a
very
memorable
occasion
maclean
the
son
of
john
gerves
who
recovered
col
and
conquered
barra
had
obtained
it
is
said
from
james
the
second
a
grant
of
the
lands
of
lochiel
forfeited
i
suppose
by
some
offence
against
the
state
forfeited
estates
were
not
in
those
days
quietly
resigned
maclean
therefore
went
with
an
armed
force
to
seize
his
new
possessions
and
i
know
not
for
what
reason
took
his
wife
with
him
the
camerons
rose
in
defence
of
their
chief
and
a
battle
was
fought
at
the
head
of
loch
ness
near
the
place
where
fort
augustus
now
stands
in
which
lochiel
obtained
the
victory
and
maclean
with
his
followers
was
defeated
and
destroyed
the
lady
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
conquerours
and
being
found
pregnant
was
placed
in
the
custody
of
maclonich
one
of
a
tribe
or
family
branched
from
cameron
with
orders
if
she
brought
a
boy
to
destroy
him
if
a
girl
to
spare
her
maclonich
wife
who
was
with
child
likewise
had
a
girl
about
the
same
time
at
which
lady
maclean
brought
a
boy
and
maclonich
with
more
generosity
to
his
captive
than
fidelity
to
his
trust
contrived
that
the
children
should
be
changed
maclean
being
thus
preserved
from
death
in
time
recovered
his
original
patrimony
and
in
gratitude
to
his
friend
made
his
castle
a
place
of
refuge
to
any
of
the
clan
that
should
think
himself
in
danger
and
as
a
proof
of
reciprocal
confidence
maclean
took
upon
himself
and
his
posterity
the
care
of
educating
the
heir
of
maclonich
this
story
like
all
other
traditions
of
the
highlands
is
variously
related
but
though
some
circumstances
are
uncertain
the
principal
fact
is
true
maclean
undoubtedly
owed
his
preservation
to
maclonich
for
the
treaty
between
the
two
families
has
been
strictly
observed
it
did
not
sink
into
disuse
and
oblivion
but
continued
in
its
full
force
while
the
chieftains
retained
their
power
i
have
read
a
demand
of
protection
made
not
more
than
years
ago
for
one
of
the
maclonichs
named
ewen
cameron
who
had
been
accessory
to
the
death
of
macmartin
and
had
been
banished
by
lochiel
his
lord
for
a
certain
term
at
the
expiration
of
which
he
returned
married
from
france
but
the
macmartins
not
satisfied
with
the
punishment
when
he
attempted
to
settle
still
threatened
him
with
vengeance
he
therefore
asked
and
obtained
shelter
in
the
isle
of
col
the
power
of
protection
subsists
no
longer
but
what
the
law
permits
is
yet
continued
and
maclean
of
col
now
educates
the
heir
of
maclonich
there
still
remains
in
the
islands
though
it
is
passing
fast
away
the
custom
of
fosterage
a
laird
a
man
of
wealth
and
eminence
sends
his
child
either
male
or
female
to
a
tacksman
or
tenant
to
be
fostered
it
is
not
always
his
own
tenant
but
some
distant
friend
that
obtains
this
honour
for
an
honour
such
a
trust
is
very
reasonably
thought
the
terms
of
fosterage
seem
to
vary
in
different
islands
in
mull
the
father
sends
with
his
child
a
certain
number
of
cows
to
which
the
same
number
is
added
by
the
fosterer
the
father
appropriates
a
proportionable
extent
of
ground
without
rent
for
their
pasturage
if
every
cow
brings
a
calf
half
belongs
to
the
fosterer
and
half
to
the
child
but
if
there
be
only
one
calf
between
two
cows
it
is
the
child
and
when
the
child
returns
to
the
parent
it
is
accompanied
by
all
the
cows
given
both
by
the
father
and
by
the
fosterer
with
half
of
the
increase
of
the
stock
by
propagation
these
beasts
are
considered
as
a
portion
and
called
macalive
cattle
of
which
the
father
has
the
produce
but
is
supposed
not
to
have
the
full
property
but
to
owe
the
same
number
to
the
child
as
a
portion
to
the
daughter
or
a
stock
for
the
son
children
continue
with
the
fosterer
perhaps
six
years
and
can
not
where
this
is
the
practice
be
considered
as
burdensome
the
fosterer
if
he
gives
four
cows
receives
likewise
four
and
has
while
the
child
continues
with
him
grass
for
eight
without
rent
with
half
the
calves
and
all
the
milk
for
which
he
pays
only
four
cows
when
he
dismisses
his
dalt
for
that
is
the
name
for
a
foster
child
fosterage
is
i
believe
sometimes
performed
upon
more
liberal
terms
our
friend
the
young
laird
of
col
was
fostered
by
macsweyn
of
grissipol
macsweyn
then
lived
a
tenant
to
sir
james
macdonald
in
the
isle
of
sky
and
therefore
col
whether
he
sent
him
cattle
or
not
could
grant
him
no
land
the
dalt
however
at
his
return
brought
back
a
considerable
number
of
macalive
cattle
and
of
the
friendship
so
formed
there
have
been
good
effects
when
macdonald
raised
his
rents
macsweyn
was
like
other
tenants
discontented
and
resigning
his
farm
removed
from
sky
to
col
and
was
established
at
grissipol
these
observations
we
made
by
favour
of
the
contrary
wind
that
drove
us
to
col
an
island
not
often
visited
for
there
is
not
much
to
amuse
curiosity
or
to
attract
avarice
the
ground
has
been
hitherto
i
believe
used
chiefly
for
pasturage
in
a
district
such
as
the
eye
can
command
there
is
a
general
herdsman
who
knows
all
the
cattle
of
the
neighbourhood
and
whose
station
is
upon
a
hill
from
which
he
surveys
the
lower
grounds
and
if
one
man
cattle
invade
another
grass
drives
them
back
to
their
own
borders
but
other
means
of
profit
begin
to
be
found
kelp
is
gathered
and
burnt
and
sloops
are
loaded
with
the
concreted
ashes
cultivation
is
likely
to
be
improved
by
the
skill
and
encouragement
of
the
present
heir
and
the
inhabitants
of
those
obscure
vallies
will
partake
of
the
general
progress
of
life
the
rents
of
the
parts
which
belong
to
the
duke
of
argyle
have
been
raised
from
to
one
hundred
and
five
pounds
whether
from
the
land
or
the
sea
i
can
not
tell
the
bounties
of
the
sea
have
lately
been
so
great
that
a
farm
in
southuist
has
risen
in
ten
years
from
a
rent
of
thirty
pounds
to
one
hundred
and
eighty
he
who
lives
in
col
and
finds
himself
condemned
to
solitary
meals
and
incommunicable
reflection
will
find
the
usefulness
of
that
middle
order
of
tacksmen
which
some
who
applaud
their
own
wisdom
are
wishing
to
destroy
without
intelligence
man
is
not
social
he
is
only
gregarious
and
little
intelligence
will
there
be
where
all
are
constrained
to
daily
labour
and
every
mind
must
wait
upon
the
hand
after
having
listened
for
some
days
to
the
tempest
and
wandered
about
the
island
till
our
curiosity
was
satisfied
we
began
to
think
about
our
departure
to
leave
col
in
october
was
not
very
easy
we
however
found
a
sloop
which
lay
on
the
coast
to
carry
kelp
and
for
a
price
which
we
thought
levied
upon
our
necessities
the
master
agreed
to
carry
us
to
mull
whence
we
might
readily
pass
back
to
scotland
mull
as
we
were
to
catch
the
first
favourable
breath
we
spent
the
night
not
very
elegantly
nor
pleasantly
in
the
vessel
and
were
landed
next
day
at
tobor
morar
a
port
in
mull
which
appears
to
an
unexperienced
eye
formed
for
the
security
of
ships
for
its
mouth
is
closed
by
a
small
island
which
admits
them
through
narrow
channels
into
a
bason
sufficiently
capacious
they
are
indeed
safe
from
the
sea
but
there
is
a
hollow
between
the
mountains
through
which
the
wind
issues
from
the
land
with
very
mischievous
violence
there
was
no
danger
while
we
were
there
and
we
found
several
other
vessels
at
anchor
so
that
the
port
had
a
very
commercial
appearance
the
young
laird
of
col
who
had
determined
not
to
let
us
lose
his
company
while
there
was
any
difficulty
remaining
came
over
with
us
his
influence
soon
appeared
for
he
procured
us
horses
and
conducted
us
to
the
house
of
doctor
maclean
where
we
found
very
kind
entertainment
and
very
pleasing
conversation
miss
maclean
who
was
born
and
had
been
bred
at
glasgow
having
removed
with
her
father
to
mull
added
to
other
qualifications
a
great
knowledge
of
the
earse
language
which
she
had
not
learned
in
her
childhood
but
gained
by
study
and
was
the
only
interpreter
of
earse
poetry
that
i
could
ever
find
the
isle
of
mull
is
perhaps
in
extent
the
third
of
the
hebrides
it
is
not
broken
by
waters
nor
shot
into
promontories
but
is
a
solid
and
compact
mass
of
breadth
nearly
equal
to
its
length
of
the
dimensions
of
the
larger
islands
there
is
no
knowledge
approaching
to
exactness
i
am
willing
to
estimate
it
as
containing
about
three
hundred
square
miles
mull
had
suffered
like
sky
by
the
black
winter
of
in
which
contrary
to
all
experience
a
continued
frost
detained
the
snow
eight
weeks
upon
the
ground
against
a
calamity
never
known
no
provision
had
been
made
and
the
people
could
only
pine
in
helpless
misery
one
tenant
was
mentioned
whose
cattle
perished
to
the
value
of
three
hundred
pounds
a
loss
which
probably
more
than
the
life
of
man
is
necessary
to
repair
in
countries
like
these
the
descriptions
of
famine
become
intelligible
where
by
vigorous
and
artful
cultivation
of
a
soil
naturally
fertile
there
is
commonly
a
superfluous
growth
both
of
grain
and
grass
where
the
fields
are
crowded
with
cattle
and
where
every
hand
is
able
to
attract
wealth
from
a
distance
by
making
something
that
promotes
ease
or
gratifies
vanity
a
dear
year
produces
only
a
comparative
want
which
is
rather
seen
than
felt
and
which
terminates
commonly
in
no
worse
effect
than
that
of
condemning
the
lower
orders
of
the
community
to
sacrifice
a
little
luxury
to
convenience
or
at
most
a
little
convenience
to
necessity
but
where
the
climate
is
unkind
and
the
ground
penurious
so
that
the
most
fruitful
years
will
produce
only
enough
to
maintain
themselves
where
life
unimproved
and
unadorned
fades
into
something
little
more
than
naked
existence
and
every
one
is
busy
for
himself
without
any
arts
by
which
the
pleasure
of
others
may
be
increased
if
to
the
daily
burden
of
distress
any
additional
weight
be
added
nothing
remains
but
to
despair
and
die
in
mull
the
disappointment
of
a
harvest
or
a
murrain
among
the
cattle
cuts
off
the
regular
provision
and
they
who
have
no
manufactures
can
purchase
no
part
of
the
superfluities
of
other
countries
the
consequence
of
a
bad
season
is
here
not
scarcity
but
emptiness
and
they
whose
plenty
was
barely
a
supply
of
natural
and
present
need
when
that
slender
stock
fails
must
perish
with
hunger
all
travel
has
its
advantages
if
the
passenger
visits
better
countries
he
may
learn
to
improve
his
own
and
if
fortune
carries
him
to
worse
he
may
learn
to
enjoy
it
boswell
curiosity
strongly
impelled
him
to
survey
iona
or
icolmkil
which
was
to
the
early
ages
the
great
school
of
theology
and
is
supposed
to
have
been
the
place
of
sepulture
for
the
ancient
kings
i
though
less
eager
did
not
oppose
him
that
we
might
perform
this
expedition
it
was
necessary
to
traverse
a
great
part
of
mull
we
passed
a
day
at
maclean
and
could
have
been
well
contented
to
stay
longer
but
col
provided
us
horses
and
we
pursued
our
journey
this
was
a
day
of
inconvenience
for
the
country
is
very
rough
and
my
horse
was
but
little
we
travelled
many
hours
through
a
tract
black
and
barren
in
which
however
there
were
the
reliques
of
humanity
for
we
found
a
ruined
chapel
in
our
way
it
is
natural
in
traversing
this
gloom
of
desolation
to
inquire
whether
something
may
not
be
done
to
give
nature
a
more
cheerful
face
and
whether
those
hills
and
moors
that
afford
heath
can
not
with
a
little
care
and
labour
bear
something
better
the
first
thought
that
occurs
is
to
cover
them
with
trees
for
that
in
many
of
these
naked
regions
trees
will
grow
is
evident
because
stumps
and
roots
are
yet
remaining
and
the
speculatist
hastily
proceeds
to
censure
that
negligence
and
laziness
that
has
omitted
for
so
long
a
time
so
easy
an
improvement
to
drop
seeds
into
the
ground
and
attend
their
growth
requires
little
labour
and
no
skill
he
who
remembers
that
all
the
woods
by
which
the
wants
of
man
have
been
supplied
from
the
deluge
till
now
were
will
not
easily
be
persuaded
to
think
all
the
art
and
preparation
necessary
which
the
georgick
writers
prescribe
to
planters
trees
certainly
have
covered
the
earth
with
very
little
culture
they
wave
their
tops
among
the
rocks
of
norway
and
might
thrive
as
well
in
the
highlands
and
hebrides
but
there
is
a
frightful
interval
between
the
seed
and
timber
he
that
calculates
the
growth
of
trees
has
the
unwelcome
remembrance
of
the
shortness
of
life
driven
hard
upon
him
he
knows
that
he
is
doing
what
will
never
benefit
himself
and
when
he
rejoices
to
see
the
stem
rise
is
disposed
to
repine
that
another
shall
cut
it
down
plantation
is
naturally
the
employment
of
a
mind
unburdened
with
care
and
vacant
to
futurity
saturated
with
present
good
and
at
leisure
to
derive
gratification
from
the
prospect
of
posterity
he
that
pines
with
hunger
is
in
little
care
how
others
shall
be
fed
the
poor
man
is
seldom
studious
to
make
his
grandson
rich
it
may
be
soon
discovered
why
in
a
place
which
hardly
supplies
the
cravings
of
necessity
there
has
been
little
attention
to
the
delights
of
fancy
and
why
distant
convenience
is
unregarded
where
the
thoughts
are
turned
with
incessant
solicitude
upon
every
possibility
of
immediate
advantage
neither
is
it
quite
so
easy
to
raise
large
woods
as
may
be
conceived
trees
intended
to
produce
timber
must
be
sown
where
they
are
to
grow
and
ground
sown
with
trees
must
be
kept
useless
for
a
long
time
inclosed
at
an
expence
from
which
many
will
be
discouraged
by
the
remoteness
of
the
profit
and
watched
with
that
attention
which
in
places
where
it
is
most
needed
will
neither
be
given
nor
bought
that
it
can
not
be
plowed
is
evident
and
if
cattle
be
suffered
to
graze
upon
it
they
will
devour
the
plants
as
fast
as
they
rise
even
in
coarser
countries
where
herds
and
flocks
are
not
fed
not
only
the
deer
and
the
wild
goats
will
browse
upon
them
but
the
hare
and
rabbit
will
nibble
them
it
is
therefore
reasonable
to
believe
what
i
do
not
remember
any
naturalist
to
have
remarked
that
there
was
a
time
when
the
world
was
very
thinly
inhabited
by
beasts
as
well
as
men
and
that
the
woods
had
leisure
to
rise
high
before
animals
had
bred
numbers
sufficient
to
intercept
them
sir
james
macdonald
in
part
of
the
wastes
of
his
territory
set
or
sowed
trees
to
the
number
as
i
have
been
told
of
several
millions
expecting
doubtless
that
they
would
grow
up
into
future
navies
and
cities
but
for
want
of
inclosure
and
of
that
care
which
is
always
necessary
and
will
hardly
ever
be
taken
all
his
cost
and
labour
have
been
lost
and
the
ground
is
likely
to
continue
an
useless
heath
having
not
any
experience
of
a
journey
in
mull
we
had
no
doubt
of
reaching
the
sea
by
and
therefore
had
not
left
very
early
we
travelled
diligently
enough
but
found
the
country
for
road
there
was
none
very
difficult
to
pass
we
were
always
struggling
with
some
obstruction
or
other
and
our
vexation
was
not
balanced
by
any
gratification
of
the
eye
or
mind
we
were
now
long
enough
acquainted
with
hills
and
heath
to
have
lost
the
emotion
that
they
once
raised
whether
pleasing
or
painful
and
had
our
mind
employed
only
on
our
own
fatigue
we
were
however
sure
under
col
protection
of
escaping
all
real
evils
there
was
no
house
in
mull
to
which
he
could
not
introduce
us
he
had
intended
to
lodge
us
for
that
night
with
a
gentleman
that
lived
upon
the
coast
but
discovered
on
the
way
that
he
then
lay
in
bed
without
hope
of
life
we
resolved
not
to
embarrass
a
family
in
a
time
of
so
much
sorrow
if
any
other
expedient
could
he
found
and
as
the
island
of
ulva
was
against
us
it
was
determined
that
we
should
pass
the
strait
and
have
recourse
to
the
laird
who
like
the
other
gentlemen
of
the
islands
was
known
to
we
expected
to
find
a
but
when
at
last
we
came
to
the
water
the
boat
was
gone
we
were
now
again
at
a
stop
it
was
the
sixteenth
of
october
a
time
when
it
is
not
convenient
to
sleep
in
the
hebrides
without
a
cover
and
there
was
no
house
within
our
reach
but
that
which
we
had
already
declined
ulva
while
we
stood
deliberating
we
were
happily
espied
from
an
irish
ship
that
lay
at
anchor
in
the
strait
the
master
saw
that
we
wanted
a
passage
and
with
great
civility
sent
us
his
boat
which
quickly
conveyed
us
to
ulva
where
we
were
very
liberally
entertained
by
macquarry
to
ulva
we
came
in
the
dark
and
left
it
before
noon
the
next
day
a
very
exact
description
therefore
will
not
be
expected
we
were
told
that
it
is
an
island
of
no
great
extent
rough
and
barren
inhabited
by
the
macquarrys
a
clan
not
powerful
nor
numerous
but
of
antiquity
which
most
other
families
are
content
to
reverence
the
name
is
supposed
to
be
a
depravation
of
some
other
for
the
earse
language
does
not
afford
it
any
etymology
macquarry
is
proprietor
both
of
ulva
and
some
adjacent
islands
among
which
is
staffa
so
lately
raised
to
renown
by
banks
when
the
islanders
were
reproached
with
their
ignorance
or
insensibility
of
the
wonders
of
staffa
they
had
not
much
to
reply
they
had
indeed
considered
it
little
because
they
had
always
seen
it
and
none
but
philosophers
nor
they
always
are
struck
with
wonder
otherwise
than
by
novelty
how
would
it
surprise
an
unenlightened
ploughman
to
hear
a
company
of
sober
men
inquiring
by
what
power
the
hand
tosses
a
stone
or
why
the
stone
when
it
is
tossed
falls
to
the
ground
of
the
ancestors
of
macquarry
who
thus
lies
hid
in
his
unfrequented
island
i
have
found
memorials
in
all
places
where
they
could
be
expected
inquiring
after
the
reliques
of
former
manners
i
found
that
in
ulva
and
i
think
no
where
else
is
continued
the
payment
of
the
mercheta
mulierum
a
fine
in
old
times
due
to
the
laird
at
the
marriage
of
a
virgin
the
original
of
this
claim
as
of
our
tenure
of
borough
english
is
variously
delivered
it
is
pleasant
to
find
ancient
customs
in
old
families
this
payment
like
others
was
for
want
of
money
made
anciently
in
the
produce
of
the
land
macquarry
was
used
to
demand
a
sheep
for
which
he
now
takes
a
crown
by
that
inattention
to
the
uncertain
proportion
between
the
value
and
the
denomination
of
money
which
has
brought
much
disorder
into
europe
a
sheep
has
always
the
same
power
of
supplying
human
wants
but
a
crown
will
bring
at
one
time
more
at
another
less
ulva
was
not
neglected
by
the
piety
of
ardent
times
it
has
still
to
show
what
was
once
a
church
inch
kenneth
in
the
morning
we
went
again
into
the
boat
and
were
landed
on
inch
kenneth
an
island
about
a
mile
long
and
perhaps
half
a
mile
broad
remarkable
for
pleasantness
and
fertility
it
is
verdant
and
grassy
and
fit
both
for
pasture
and
tillage
but
it
has
no
trees
its
only
inhabitants
were
sir
allan
maclean
and
two
young
ladies
his
daughters
with
their
servants
romance
does
not
often
exhibit
a
scene
that
strikes
the
imagination
more
than
this
little
desert
in
these
depths
of
western
obscurity
occupied
not
by
a
gross
herdsman
or
amphibious
fisherman
but
by
a
gentleman
and
two
ladies
of
high
birth
polished
manners
and
elegant
conversation
who
in
a
habitation
raised
not
very
far
above
the
ground
but
furnished
with
unexpected
neatness
and
convenience
practised
all
the
kindness
of
hospitality
and
refinement
of
courtesy
sir
allan
is
the
chieftain
of
the
great
clan
of
maclean
which
is
said
to
claim
the
second
place
among
the
highland
families
yielding
only
to
macdonald
though
by
the
misconduct
of
his
ancestors
most
of
the
extensive
territory
which
would
have
descended
to
him
has
been
alienated
he
still
retains
much
of
the
dignity
and
authority
of
his
birth
when
soldiers
were
lately
wanting
for
the
american
war
application
was
made
to
sir
allan
and
he
nominated
a
hundred
men
for
the
service
who
obeyed
the
summons
and
bore
arms
under
his
command
he
had
then
for
some
time
resided
with
the
young
ladies
in
inch
kenneth
where
he
lives
not
only
with
plenty
but
with
elegance
having
conveyed
to
his
cottage
a
collection
of
books
and
what
else
is
necessary
to
make
his
hours
pleasant
when
we
landed
we
were
met
by
sir
allan
and
the
ladies
accompanied
by
miss
macquarry
who
had
passed
some
time
with
them
and
now
returned
to
ulva
with
her
father
we
all
walked
together
to
the
mansion
where
we
found
one
cottage
for
sir
allan
and
i
think
two
more
for
the
domesticks
and
the
offices
we
entered
and
wanted
little
that
palaces
afford
our
room
was
neatly
floored
and
well
lighted
and
our
dinner
which
was
dressed
in
one
of
the
other
huts
was
plentiful
and
delicate
in
the
afternoon
sir
allan
reminded
us
that
the
day
was
sunday
which
he
never
suffered
to
pass
without
some
religious
distinction
and
invited
us
to
partake
in
his
acts
of
domestick
worship
which
i
hope
neither
boswell
nor
myself
will
be
suspected
of
a
disposition
to
refuse
the
elder
of
the
ladies
read
the
english
service
inch
kenneth
was
once
a
seminary
of
ecclesiasticks
subordinate
i
suppose
to
icolmkill
sir
allan
had
a
mind
to
trace
the
foundations
of
the
college
but
neither
i
nor
boswell
who
bends
a
keener
eye
on
vacancy
were
able
to
perceive
them
our
attention
however
was
sufficiently
engaged
by
a
venerable
chapel
which
stands
yet
entire
except
that
the
roof
is
gone
it
is
about
sixty
feet
in
length
and
thirty
in
breadth
on
one
side
of
the
altar
is
a
bas
relief
of
the
blessed
virgin
and
by
it
lies
a
little
bell
which
though
cracked
and
without
a
clapper
has
remained
there
for
ages
guarded
only
by
the
venerableness
of
the
place
the
ground
round
the
chapel
is
covered
with
gravestones
of
chiefs
and
ladies
and
still
continues
to
be
a
place
of
sepulture
inch
kenneth
is
a
proper
prelude
to
icolmkill
it
was
not
without
some
mournful
emotion
that
we
contemplated
the
ruins
of
religious
structures
and
the
monuments
of
the
dead
on
the
next
day
we
took
a
more
distinct
view
of
the
place
and
went
with
the
boat
to
see
oysters
in
the
bed
out
of
which
the
boatmen
forced
up
as
many
as
were
wanted
even
inch
kenneth
has
a
subordinate
island
named
sandiland
i
suppose
in
contempt
where
we
landed
and
found
a
rock
with
a
surface
of
perhaps
four
acres
of
which
one
is
naked
stone
another
spread
with
sand
and
shells
some
of
which
i
picked
up
for
their
glossy
beauty
and
two
covered
with
a
little
earth
and
grass
on
which
sir
allan
has
a
few
sheep
i
doubt
not
but
when
there
was
a
college
at
inch
kenneth
there
was
a
hermitage
upon
sandiland
having
wandered
over
those
extensive
plains
we
committed
ourselves
again
to
the
winds
and
waters
and
after
a
voyage
of
about
ten
minutes
in
which
we
met
with
nothing
very
observable
were
again
safe
upon
dry
ground
we
told
sir
allan
our
desire
of
visiting
icolmkill
and
entreated
him
to
give
us
his
protection
and
his
company
he
thought
proper
to
hesitate
a
little
but
the
ladies
hinted
that
as
they
knew
he
would
not
finally
refuse
he
would
do
better
if
he
preserved
the
grace
of
ready
compliance
he
took
their
advice
and
promised
to
carry
us
on
the
morrow
in
his
boat
we
passed
the
remaining
part
of
the
day
in
such
amusements
as
were
in
our
power
sir
allan
related
the
american
campaign
and
at
evening
one
of
the
ladies
played
on
her
harpsichord
while
col
and
boswell
danced
a
scottish
reel
with
the
other
we
could
have
been
easily
persuaded
to
a
longer
stay
upon
inch
kenneth
but
life
will
not
be
all
passed
in
delight
the
session
at
edinburgh
was
approaching
from
which
boswell
could
not
be
absent
in
the
morning
our
boat
was
ready
it
was
high
and
strong
sir
allan
victualled
it
for
the
day
and
provided
able
rowers
we
now
parted
from
the
young
laird
of
col
who
had
treated
us
with
so
much
kindness
and
concluded
his
favours
by
consigning
us
to
sir
allan
here
we
had
the
last
embrace
of
this
amiable
man
who
while
these
pages
were
preparing
to
attest
his
virtues
perished
in
the
passage
between
ulva
and
inch
kenneth
sir
allan
to
whom
the
whole
region
was
well
known
told
us
of
a
very
remarkable
cave
to
which
he
would
show
us
the
way
we
had
been
disappointed
already
by
one
cave
and
were
not
much
elevated
by
the
expectation
of
another
it
was
yet
better
to
see
it
and
we
stopped
at
some
rocks
on
the
coast
of
mull
the
mouth
is
fortified
by
vast
fragments
of
stone
over
which
we
made
our
way
neither
very
nimbly
nor
very
securely
the
place
however
well
repaid
our
trouble
the
bottom
as
far
as
the
flood
rushes
in
was
encumbered
with
large
pebbles
but
as
we
advanced
was
spread
over
with
smooth
sand
the
breadth
is
about
feet
the
roof
rises
in
an
arch
almost
regular
to
a
height
which
we
could
not
measure
but
i
think
it
about
thirty
feet
this
part
of
our
curiosity
was
nearly
frustrated
for
though
we
went
to
see
a
cave
and
knew
that
caves
are
dark
we
forgot
to
carry
tapers
and
did
not
discover
our
omission
till
we
were
wakened
by
our
wants
sir
allan
then
sent
one
of
the
boatmen
into
the
country
who
soon
returned
with
one
little
candle
we
were
thus
enabled
to
go
forward
but
could
not
venture
far
having
passed
inward
from
the
sea
to
a
great
depth
we
found
on
the
right
hand
a
narrow
passage
perhaps
not
more
than
six
feet
wide
obstructed
by
great
stones
over
which
we
climbed
and
came
into
a
second
cave
in
breadth
feet
the
air
in
this
apartment
was
very
warm
but
not
oppressive
nor
loaded
with
vapours
our
light
showed
no
tokens
of
a
feculent
or
corrupted
atmosphere
here
was
a
square
stone
called
as
we
are
told
fingal
table
if
we
had
been
provided
with
torches
we
should
have
proceeded
in
our
search
though
we
had
already
gone
as
far
as
any
former
adventurer
except
some
who
are
reported
never
to
have
returned
and
measuring
our
way
back
we
found
it
more
than
a
hundred
and
sixty
yards
the
eleventh
part
of
a
mile
our
measures
were
not
critically
exact
having
been
made
with
a
walking
pole
such
as
it
is
convenient
to
carry
in
these
rocky
countries
of
which
i
guessed
the
length
by
standing
against
it
in
this
there
could
be
no
great
errour
nor
do
i
much
doubt
but
the
highlander
whom
we
employed
reported
the
number
right
more
nicety
however
is
better
and
no
man
should
travel
unprovided
with
instruments
for
taking
heights
and
distances
there
is
yet
another
cause
of
errour
not
always
easily
surmounted
though
more
dangerous
to
the
veracity
of
itinerary
narratives
than
imperfect
mensuration
an
observer
deeply
impressed
by
any
remarkable
spectacle
does
not
suppose
that
the
traces
will
soon
vanish
from
his
mind
and
having
commonly
no
great
convenience
for
writing
defers
the
description
to
a
time
of
more
leisure
and
better
accommodation
he
who
has
not
made
the
experiment
or
who
is
not
accustomed
to
require
rigorous
accuracy
from
himself
will
scarcely
believe
how
much
a
few
hours
take
from
certainty
of
knowledge
and
distinctness
of
imagery
how
the
succession
of
objects
will
be
broken
how
separate
parts
will
be
confused
and
how
many
particular
features
and
discriminations
will
be
compressed
and
conglobated
into
one
gross
and
general
idea
to
this
dilatory
notation
must
be
imputed
the
false
relations
of
travellers
where
there
is
no
imaginable
motive
to
deceive
they
trusted
to
memory
what
can
not
be
trusted
safely
but
to
the
eye
and
told
by
guess
what
a
few
hours
before
they
had
known
with
certainty
thus
it
was
that
wheeler
and
spon
described
with
irreconcilable
contrariety
things
which
they
surveyed
together
and
which
both
undoubtedly
designed
to
show
as
they
saw
them
when
we
had
satisfied
our
curiosity
in
the
cave
so
far
as
our
penury
of
light
permitted
us
we
clambered
again
to
our
boat
and
proceeded
along
the
coast
of
mull
to
a
headland
called
atun
remarkable
for
the
columnar
form
of
the
rocks
which
rise
in
a
series
of
pilasters
with
a
degree
of
regularity
which
sir
allan
thinks
not
less
worthy
of
curiosity
than
the
shore
of
staffa
not
long
after
we
came
to
another
range
of
black
rocks
which
had
the
appearance
of
broken
pilasters
set
one
behind
another
to
a
great
depth
this
place
was
chosen
by
sir
allan
for
our
dinner
we
were
easily
accommodated
with
seats
for
the
stones
were
of
all
heights
and
refreshed
ourselves
and
our
boatmen
who
could
have
no
other
rest
till
we
were
at
icolmkill
the
evening
was
now
approaching
and
we
were
yet
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
end
of
our
expedition
we
could
therefore
stop
no
more
to
make
remarks
in
the
way
but
set
forward
with
some
degree
of
eagerness
the
day
soon
failed
us
and
the
moon
presented
a
very
solemn
and
pleasing
scene
the
sky
was
clear
so
that
the
eye
commanded
a
wide
circle
the
sea
was
neither
still
nor
turbulent
the
wind
neither
silent
nor
loud
we
were
never
far
from
one
coast
or
another
on
which
if
the
weather
had
become
violent
we
could
have
found
shelter
and
therefore
contemplated
at
ease
the
region
through
which
we
glided
in
the
tranquillity
of
the
night
and
saw
now
a
rock
and
now
an
island
grow
gradually
conspicuous
and
gradually
obscure
i
committed
the
fault
which
i
have
just
been
censuring
in
neglecting
as
we
passed
to
note
the
series
of
this
placid
navigation
we
were
very
near
an
island
called
nun
island
perhaps
from
an
ancient
convent
here
is
said
to
have
been
dug
the
stone
that
was
used
in
the
buildings
of
icolmkill
whether
it
is
now
inhabited
we
could
not
stay
to
inquire
at
last
we
came
to
icolmkill
but
found
no
convenience
for
landing
our
boat
could
not
be
forced
very
near
the
dry
ground
and
our
highlanders
carried
us
over
the
water
we
were
now
treading
that
illustrious
island
which
was
once
the
luminary
of
the
caledonian
regions
whence
savage
clans
and
roving
barbarians
derived
the
benefits
of
knowledge
and
the
blessings
of
religion
to
abstract
the
mind
from
all
local
emotion
would
be
impossible
if
it
were
endeavoured
and
would
be
foolish
if
it
were
possible
whatever
withdraws
us
from
the
power
of
our
senses
whatever
makes
the
past
the
distant
or
the
future
predominate
over
the
present
advances
us
in
the
dignity
of
thinking
beings
far
from
me
and
from
my
friends
be
such
frigid
philosophy
as
may
conduct
us
indifferent
and
unmoved
over
any
ground
which
has
been
dignified
by
wisdom
bravery
or
virtue
that
man
is
little
to
be
envied
whose
patriotism
would
not
gain
force
upon
the
plain
of
marathon
or
whose
piety
would
not
grow
warmer
among
the
ruins
of
iona
we
came
too
late
to
visit
monuments
some
care
was
necessary
for
ourselves
whatever
was
in
the
island
sir
allan
could
command
for
the
inhabitants
were
macleans
but
having
little
they
could
not
give
us
much
he
went
to
the
headman
of
the
island
whom
fame
but
fame
delights
in
amplifying
represents
as
worth
no
less
than
fifty
pounds
he
was
perhaps
proud
enough
of
his
guests
but
ill
prepared
for
our
entertainment
however
he
soon
produced
more
provision
than
men
not
luxurious
require
our
lodging
was
next
to
be
provided
we
found
a
barn
well
stocked
with
hay
and
made
our
beds
as
soft
as
we
could
in
the
morning
we
rose
and
surveyed
the
place
the
churches
of
the
two
convents
are
both
standing
though
unroofed
they
were
built
of
unhewn
stone
but
solid
and
not
inelegant
i
brought
away
rude
measures
of
the
buildings
such
as
i
can
not
much
trust
myself
inaccurately
taken
and
obscurely
noted
pennant
delineations
which
are
doubtless
exact
have
made
my
unskilful
description
less
necessary
the
episcopal
church
consists
of
two
parts
separated
by
the
belfry
and
built
at
different
times
the
original
church
had
like
others
the
altar
at
one
end
and
tower
at
the
other
but
as
it
grew
too
small
another
building
of
equal
dimension
was
added
and
the
tower
then
was
necessarily
in
the
middle
that
these
edifices
are
of
different
ages
seems
evident
the
arch
of
the
first
church
is
roman
being
part
of
a
circle
that
of
the
additional
building
is
pointed
and
therefore
gothick
or
saracenical
the
tower
is
firm
and
wants
only
to
be
floored
and
covered
of
the
chambers
or
cells
belonging
to
the
monks
there
are
some
walls
remaining
but
nothing
approaching
to
a
complete
apartment
the
bottom
of
the
church
is
so
incumbered
with
mud
and
rubbish
that
we
could
make
no
discoveries
of
curious
inscriptions
and
what
there
are
have
been
already
published
the
place
is
said
to
be
known
where
the
black
stones
lie
concealed
on
which
the
old
highland
chiefs
when
they
made
contracts
and
alliances
used
to
take
the
oath
which
was
considered
as
more
sacred
than
any
other
obligation
and
which
could
not
be
violated
without
the
blackest
infamy
in
those
days
of
violence
and
rapine
it
was
of
great
importance
to
impress
upon
savage
minds
the
sanctity
of
an
oath
by
some
particular
and
extraordinary
circumstances
they
would
not
have
recourse
to
the
black
stones
upon
small
or
common
occasions
and
when
they
had
established
their
faith
by
this
tremendous
sanction
inconstancy
and
treachery
were
no
longer
feared
the
chapel
of
the
nunnery
is
now
used
by
the
inhabitants
as
a
kind
of
general
and
the
bottom
is
consequently
too
miry
for
examination
some
of
the
stones
which
covered
the
later
abbesses
have
inscriptions
which
might
yet
be
read
if
the
chapel
were
cleansed
the
roof
of
this
as
of
all
the
other
buildings
is
totally
destroyed
not
only
because
timber
quickly
decays
when
it
is
neglected
but
because
in
an
island
utterly
destitute
of
wood
it
was
wanted
for
use
and
was
consequently
the
first
plunder
of
needy
rapacity
the
chancel
of
the
nuns
chapel
is
covered
with
an
arch
of
stone
to
which
time
has
done
no
injury
and
a
small
apartment
communicating
with
the
choir
on
the
north
side
like
the
in
cathedrals
roofed
with
stone
in
the
same
manner
is
likewise
entire
in
one
of
the
churches
was
a
marble
altar
which
the
superstition
of
the
inhabitants
has
destroyed
their
opinion
was
that
a
fragment
of
this
stone
was
a
defence
against
shipwrecks
fire
and
miscarriages
in
one
corner
of
the
church
the
bason
for
holy
water
is
yet
unbroken
the
cemetery
of
the
nunnery
was
till
very
lately
regarded
with
such
reverence
that
only
women
were
buried
in
it
these
reliques
of
veneration
always
produce
some
mournful
pleasure
i
could
have
forgiven
a
great
injury
more
easily
than
the
violation
of
this
imaginary
sanctity
south
of
the
chapel
stand
the
walls
of
a
large
room
which
was
probably
the
hall
or
refectory
of
the
nunnery
this
apartment
is
capable
of
repair
of
the
rest
of
the
convent
there
are
only
fragments
besides
the
two
principal
churches
there
are
i
think
five
chapels
yet
standing
and
three
more
remembered
there
are
also
crosses
of
which
two
bear
the
names
of
john
and
matthew
a
large
space
of
ground
about
these
consecrated
edifices
is
covered
with
gravestones
few
of
which
have
any
inscription
he
that
surveys
it
attended
by
an
insular
antiquary
may
be
told
where
the
kings
of
many
nations
are
buried
and
if
he
loves
to
sooth
his
imagination
with
the
thoughts
that
naturally
rise
in
places
where
the
great
and
the
powerful
lie
mingled
with
the
dust
let
him
listen
in
submissive
silence
for
if
he
asks
any
questions
his
delight
is
at
an
end
iona
has
long
enjoyed
without
any
very
credible
attestation
the
honour
of
being
reputed
the
cemetery
of
the
scottish
kings
it
is
not
unlikely
that
when
the
opinion
of
local
sanctity
was
prevalent
the
chieftains
of
the
isles
and
perhaps
some
of
the
norwegian
or
irish
princes
were
reposited
in
this
venerable
enclosure
but
by
whom
the
subterraneous
vaults
are
peopled
is
now
utterly
unknown
the
graves
are
very
numerous
and
some
of
them
undoubtedly
contain
the
remains
of
men
who
did
not
expect
to
be
so
soon
forgotten
not
far
from
this
awful
ground
may
be
traced
the
garden
of
the
monastery
the
fishponds
are
yet
discernible
and
the
aqueduct
which
supplied
them
is
still
in
use
there
remains
a
broken
building
which
is
called
the
bishop
house
i
know
not
by
what
authority
it
was
once
the
residence
of
some
man
above
the
common
rank
for
it
has
two
stories
and
a
chimney
we
were
shewn
a
chimney
at
the
other
end
which
was
only
a
nich
without
perforation
but
so
much
does
antiquarian
credulity
or
patriotick
vanity
prevail
that
it
was
not
much
more
safe
to
trust
the
eye
of
our
instructor
than
the
memory
there
is
in
the
island
one
house
more
and
only
one
that
has
a
chimney
we
entered
it
and
found
it
neither
wanting
repair
nor
inhabitants
but
to
the
farmers
who
now
possess
it
the
chimney
is
of
no
great
value
for
their
fire
was
made
on
the
floor
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
notwithstanding
the
dignity
of
their
mansion
they
rejoiced
like
their
neighbours
in
the
comforts
of
smoke
it
is
observed
that
ecclesiastical
colleges
are
always
in
the
most
pleasant
and
fruitful
places
while
the
world
allowed
the
monks
their
choice
it
is
surely
no
dishonour
that
they
chose
well
this
island
is
remarkably
fruitful
the
village
near
the
churches
is
said
to
contain
seventy
families
which
at
five
in
a
family
is
more
than
a
hundred
inhabitants
to
a
mile
there
are
perhaps
other
villages
yet
both
corn
and
cattle
are
annually
exported
but
the
fruitfulness
of
iona
is
now
its
whole
prosperity
the
inhabitants
are
remarkably
gross
and
remarkably
neglected
i
know
not
if
they
are
visited
by
any
minister
the
island
which
was
once
the
metropolis
of
learning
and
piety
has
now
no
school
for
education
nor
temple
for
worship
only
two
inhabitants
that
can
speak
english
and
not
one
that
can
write
or
read
the
people
are
of
the
clan
of
maclean
and
though
sir
allan
had
not
been
in
the
place
for
many
years
he
was
received
with
all
the
reverence
due
to
their
chieftain
one
of
them
being
sharply
reprehended
by
him
for
not
sending
him
some
rum
declared
after
his
departure
in
presence
that
he
had
no
design
of
disappointing
him
said
he
would
cut
my
bones
for
him
and
if
he
had
sent
his
dog
for
it
he
should
have
had
it
when
we
were
to
depart
our
boat
was
left
by
the
ebb
at
a
great
distance
from
the
water
but
no
sooner
did
we
wish
it
afloat
than
the
islanders
gathered
round
it
and
by
the
union
of
many
hands
pushed
it
down
the
beach
every
man
who
could
contribute
his
help
seemed
to
think
himself
happy
in
the
opportunity
of
being
for
a
moment
useful
to
his
chief
we
now
left
those
illustrious
ruins
by
which
boswell
was
much
affected
nor
would
i
willingly
be
thought
to
have
looked
upon
them
without
some
emotion
perhaps
in
the
revolutions
of
the
world
iona
may
be
sometime
again
the
instructress
of
the
western
regions
it
was
no
long
voyage
to
mull
where
under
sir
allan
protection
we
landed
in
the
evening
and
were
entertained
for
the
night
by
maclean
a
minister
that
lives
upon
the
coast
whose
elegance
of
conversation
and
strength
of
judgment
would
make
him
conspicuous
in
places
of
greater
celebrity
next
day
we
dined
with
maclean
another
physician
and
then
travelled
on
to
the
house
of
a
very
powerful
laird
maclean
of
lochbuy
for
in
this
country
every
man
name
is
maclean
where
races
are
thus
numerous
and
thus
combined
none
but
the
chief
of
a
clan
is
addressed
by
his
name
the
laird
of
dunvegan
is
called
macleod
but
other
gentlemen
of
the
same
family
are
denominated
by
the
places
where
they
reside
as
raasa
or
talisker
the
distinction
of
the
meaner
people
is
made
by
their
christian
names
in
consequence
of
this
practice
the
late
laird
of
macfarlane
an
eminent
genealogist
considered
himself
as
disrespectfully
treated
if
the
common
addition
was
applied
to
him
macfarlane
said
he
may
with
equal
propriety
be
said
to
many
but
i
and
i
only
am
macfarlane
our
afternoon
journey
was
through
a
country
of
such
gloomy
desolation
that
boswell
thought
no
part
of
the
highlands
equally
terrifick
yet
we
came
without
any
difficulty
at
evening
to
lochbuy
where
we
found
a
true
highland
laird
rough
and
haughty
and
tenacious
of
his
dignity
who
hearing
my
name
inquired
whether
i
was
of
the
johnstons
of
glencroe
or
of
ardnamurchan
lochbuy
has
like
the
other
insular
chieftains
quitted
the
castle
that
sheltered
his
ancestors
and
lives
near
it
in
a
mansion
not
very
spacious
or
splendid
i
have
seen
no
houses
in
the
islands
much
to
be
envied
for
convenience
or
magnificence
yet
they
bare
testimony
to
the
progress
of
arts
and
civility
as
they
shew
that
rapine
and
surprise
are
no
longer
dreaded
and
are
much
more
commodious
than
the
ancient
fortresses
the
castles
of
the
hebrides
many
of
which
are
standing
and
many
ruined
were
always
built
upon
points
of
land
on
the
margin
of
the
sea
for
the
choice
of
this
situation
there
must
have
been
some
general
reason
which
the
change
of
manners
has
left
in
obscurity
they
were
of
no
use
in
the
days
of
piracy
as
defences
of
the
coast
for
it
was
equally
accessible
in
other
places
had
they
been
or
they
would
have
been
of
more
use
to
the
invader
than
the
natives
who
could
want
no
such
directions
of
their
own
waters
for
a
a
cottage
on
a
hill
would
have
been
better
as
it
would
have
commanded
a
wider
view
if
they
be
considered
merely
as
places
of
retreat
the
situation
seems
not
well
chosen
for
the
laird
of
an
island
is
safest
from
foreign
enemies
in
the
center
on
the
coast
he
might
be
more
suddenly
surprised
than
in
the
inland
parts
and
the
invaders
if
their
enterprise
miscarried
might
more
easily
retreat
some
convenience
however
whatever
it
was
their
position
on
the
shore
afforded
for
uniformity
of
practice
seldom
continues
long
without
good
reason
a
castle
in
the
islands
is
only
a
single
tower
of
three
or
four
stories
of
which
the
walls
are
sometimes
eight
or
nine
feet
thick
with
narrow
windows
and
close
winding
stairs
of
stone
the
top
rises
in
a
cone
or
pyramid
of
stone
encompassed
by
battlements
the
intermediate
floors
are
sometimes
frames
of
timber
as
in
common
houses
and
sometimes
arches
of
stone
or
alternately
stone
and
timber
so
that
there
was
very
little
danger
from
fire
in
the
center
of
every
floor
from
top
to
bottom
is
the
chief
room
of
no
great
extent
round
which
there
are
narrow
cavities
or
recesses
formed
by
small
vacuities
or
by
a
double
wall
i
know
not
whether
there
be
ever
more
than
one
they
had
not
capacity
to
contain
many
people
or
much
provision
but
their
enemies
could
seldom
stay
to
blockade
them
for
if
they
failed
in
the
first
attack
their
next
care
was
to
escape
the
walls
were
always
too
strong
to
be
shaken
by
such
desultory
hostilities
the
windows
were
too
narrow
to
be
entered
and
the
battlements
too
high
to
be
scaled
the
only
danger
was
at
the
gates
over
which
the
wall
was
built
with
a
square
cavity
not
unlike
a
chimney
continued
to
the
top
through
this
hollow
the
defendants
let
fall
stones
upon
those
who
attempted
to
break
the
gate
and
poured
down
water
perhaps
scalding
water
if
the
attack
was
made
with
fire
the
castle
of
lochbuy
was
secured
by
double
doors
of
which
the
outer
was
an
iron
grate
in
every
castle
is
a
well
and
a
dungeon
the
use
of
the
well
is
evident
the
dungeon
is
a
deep
subterraneous
cavity
walled
on
the
sides
and
arched
on
the
top
into
which
the
descent
is
through
a
narrow
door
by
a
ladder
or
a
rope
so
that
it
seems
impossible
to
escape
when
the
rope
or
ladder
is
drawn
up
the
dungeon
was
i
suppose
in
war
a
prison
for
such
captives
as
were
treated
with
severity
and
in
peace
for
such
delinquents
as
had
committed
crimes
within
the
laird
jurisdiction
for
the
mansions
of
many
lairds
were
till
the
late
privation
of
their
privileges
the
halls
of
justice
to
their
own
tenants
as
these
fortifications
were
the
productions
of
mere
necessity
they
are
built
only
for
safety
with
little
regard
to
convenience
and
with
none
to
elegance
or
pleasure
it
was
sufficient
for
a
laird
of
the
hebrides
if
he
had
a
strong
house
in
which
he
could
hide
his
wife
and
children
from
the
next
clan
that
they
are
not
large
nor
splendid
is
no
wonder
it
is
not
easy
to
find
how
they
were
raised
such
as
they
are
by
men
who
had
no
money
in
countries
where
the
labourers
and
artificers
could
scarcely
be
fed
the
buildings
in
different
parts
of
the
island
shew
their
degrees
of
wealth
and
power
i
believe
that
for
all
the
castles
which
i
have
seen
beyond
the
tweed
the
ruins
yet
remaining
of
some
one
of
those
which
the
english
built
in
wales
would
supply
materials
these
castles
afford
another
evidence
that
the
fictions
of
romantick
chivalry
had
for
their
basis
the
real
manners
of
the
feudal
times
when
every
lord
of
a
seignory
lived
in
his
hold
lawless
and
unaccountable
with
all
the
licentiousness
and
insolence
of
uncontested
superiority
and
unprincipled
power
the
traveller
whoever
he
might
be
coming
to
the
fortified
habitation
of
a
chieftain
would
probably
have
been
interrogated
from
the
battlements
admitted
with
caution
at
the
gate
introduced
to
a
petty
monarch
fierce
with
habitual
hostility
and
vigilant
with
ignorant
suspicion
who
according
to
his
general
temper
or
accidental
humour
would
have
seated
a
stranger
as
his
guest
at
the
table
or
as
a
spy
confined
him
in
the
dungeon
lochbuy
means
the
yellow
lake
which
is
the
name
given
to
an
inlet
of
the
sea
upon
which
the
castle
of
maclean
stands
the
reason
of
the
appellation
we
did
not
learn
we
were
now
to
leave
the
hebrides
where
we
had
spent
some
weeks
with
sufficient
amusement
and
where
we
had
amplified
our
thoughts
with
new
scenes
of
nature
and
new
modes
of
life
more
time
would
have
given
us
a
more
distinct
view
but
it
was
necessary
that
boswell
should
return
before
the
courts
of
justice
were
opened
and
it
was
not
proper
to
live
too
long
upon
hospitality
however
liberally
imparted
of
these
islands
it
must
be
confessed
that
they
have
not
many
allurements
but
to
the
mere
lover
of
naked
nature
the
inhabitants
are
thin
provisions
are
scarce
and
desolation
and
penury
give
little
pleasure
the
people
collectively
considered
are
not
few
though
their
numbers
are
small
in
proportion
to
the
space
which
they
occupy
mull

said
to
contain

thousand
of
the
computation
respecting
mull
i
can
give
no
account
but
when
i
doubted
the
truth
of
the
numbers
attributed
to
sky
one
of
the
ministers
exhibited
such
facts
as
conquered
my
incredulity
of
the
proportion
which
the
product
of
any
region
bears
to
the
people
an
estimate
is
commonly
made
according
to
the
pecuniary
price
of
the
necessaries
of
life
a
principle
of
judgment
which
is
never
certain
because
it
supposes
what
is
far
from
truth
that
the
value
of
money
is
always
the
same
and
so
measures
an
unknown
quantity
by
an
uncertain
standard
it
is
competent
enough
when
the
markets
of
the
same
country
at
different
times
and
those
times
not
too
distant
are
to
be
compared
but
of
very
little
use
for
the
purpose
of
making
one
nation
acquainted
with
the
state
of
another
provisions
though
plentiful
are
sold
in
places
of
great
pecuniary
opulence
for
nominal
prices
to
which
however
scarce
where
gold
and
silver
are
yet
scarcer
they
can
never
be
raised
in
the
western
islands
there
is
so
little
internal
commerce
that
hardly
any
thing
has
a
known
or
settled
rate
the
price
of
things
brought
in
or
carried
out
is
to
be
considered
as
that
of
a
foreign
market
and
even
this
there
is
some
difficulty
in
discovering
because
their
denominations
of
quantity
are
different
from
ours
and
when
there
is
ignorance
on
both
sides
no
appeal
can
be
made
to
a
common
measure
this
however
is
not
the
only
impediment
the
scots
with
a
vigilance
of
jealousy
which
never
goes
to
sleep
always
suspect
that
an
englishman
despises
them
for
their
poverty
and
to
convince
him
that
they
are
not
less
rich
than
their
neighbours
are
sure
to
tell
him
a
price
higher
than
the
true
when
lesley
two
hundred
years
ago
related
so
punctiliously
that
a
hundred
hen
eggs
new
laid
were
sold
in
the
islands
for
a
peny
he
supposed
that
no
inference
could
possibly
follow
but
that
eggs
were
in
great
abundance
posterity
has
since
grown
wiser
and
having
learned
that
nominal
and
real
value
may
differ
they
now
tell
no
such
stories
lest
the
foreigner
should
happen
to
collect
not
that
eggs
are
many
but
that
pence
are
few
money
and
wealth
have
by
the
use
of
commercial
language
been
so
long
confounded
that
they
are
commonly
supposed
to
be
the
same
and
this
prejudice
has
spread
so
widely
in
scotland
that
i
know
not
whether
i
found
man
or
woman
whom
i
interrogated
concerning
payments
of
money
that
could
surmount
the
illiberal
desire
of
deceiving
me
by
representing
every
thing
as
dearer
than
it
is
from
lochbuy
we
rode
a
very
few
miles
to
the
side
of
mull
which
faces
scotland
where
having
taken
leave
of
our
kind
protector
sir
allan
we
embarked
in
a
boat
in
which
the
seat
provided
for
our
accommodation
was
a
heap
of
rough
brushwood
and
on
the
of
october
reposed
at
a
tolerable
inn
on
the
main
land
on
the
next
day
we
began
our
journey
southwards
the
weather
was
tempestuous
for
half
the
day
the
ground
was
rough
and
our
horses
were
still
small
had
they
required
much
restraint
we
might
have
been
reduced
to
difficulties
for
i
think
we
had
amongst
us
but
one
bridle
we
fed
the
poor
animals
liberally
and
they
performed
their
journey
well
in
the
latter
part
of
the
day
we
came
to
a
firm
and
smooth
road
made
by
the
soldiers
on
which
we
travelled
with
great
security
busied
with
contemplating
the
scene
about
us
the
night
came
on
while
we
had
yet
a
great
part
of
the
way
to
go
though
not
so
dark
but
that
we
could
discern
the
cataracts
which
poured
down
the
hills
on
one
side
and
fell
into
one
general
channel
that
ran
with
great
violence
on
the
other
the
wind
was
loud
the
rain
was
heavy
and
the
whistling
of
the
blast
the
fall
of
the
shower
the
rush
of
the
cataracts
and
the
roar
of
the
torrent
made
a
nobler
chorus
of
the
rough
musick
of
nature
than
it
had
ever
been
my
chance
to
hear
before
the
streams
which
ran
cross
the
way
from
the
hills
to
the
main
current
were
so
frequent
that
after
a
while
i
began
to
count
them
and
in
ten
miles
reckoned
probably
missing
some
and
having
let
some
pass
before
they
forced
themselves
upon
my
notice
at
last
we
came
to
inverary
where
we
found
an
inn
not
only
commodious
but
magnificent
the
difficulties
of
peregrination
were
now
at
an
end
boswell
had
the
honour
of
being
known
to
the
duke
of
argyle
by
whom
we
were
very
kindly
entertained
at
his
splendid
seat
and
supplied
with
conveniences
for
surveying
his
spacious
park
and
rising
forests
after
two
days
stay
at
inverary
we
proceeded
southward
over
glencroe
a
black
and
dreary
region
now
made
easily
passable
by
a
military
road
which
rises
from
either
end
of
the
glen
by
an
acclivity
not
dangerously
steep
but
sufficiently
laborious
in
the
middle
at
the
top
of
the
hill
is
a
seat
with
this
inscription
and
be
thankful
stones
were
placed
to
mark
the
distances
which
the
inhabitants
have
taken
away
resolved
they
said
have
no
new
miles
in
this
rainy
season
the
hills
streamed
with
waterfalls
which
crossing
the
way
formed
currents
on
the
other
side
that
ran
in
contrary
directions
as
they
fell
to
the
north
or
south
of
the
summit
being
by
the
favour
of
the
duke
well
mounted
i
went
up
and
down
the
hill
with
great
convenience
from
glencroe
we
passed
through
a
pleasant
country
to
the
banks
of
loch
lomond
and
were
received
at
the
house
of
sir
james
colquhoun
who
is
owner
of
almost
all
the
thirty
islands
of
the
loch
which
we
went
in
a
boat
next
morning
to
survey
the
heaviness
of
the
rain
shortened
our
voyage
but
we
landed
on
one
island
planted
with
yew
and
stocked
with
deer
and
on
another
containing
perhaps
not
more
than
half
an
acre
remarkable
for
the
ruins
of
an
old
castle
on
which
the
osprey
builds
her
annual
nest
had
loch
lomond
been
in
a
happier
climate
it
would
have
been
the
boast
of
wealth
and
vanity
to
own
one
of
the
little
spots
which
it
incloses
and
to
have
employed
upon
it
all
the
arts
of
embellishment
but
as
it
is
the
islets
which
court
the
gazer
at
a
distance
disgust
him
at
his
approach
when
he
finds
instead
of
soft
lawns
and
shady
thickets
nothing
more
than
uncultivated
ruggedness
where
the
loch
discharges
itself
into
a
river
called
the
leven
we
passed
a
night
with
smollet
a
relation
of
doctor
smollet
to
whose
memory
he
has
raised
an
obelisk
on
the
bank
near
the
house
in
which
he
was
born
the
civility
and
respect
which
we
found
at
every
place
it
is
ungrateful
to
omit
and
tedious
to
repeat
here
we
were
met
by
a
chaise
that
conveyed
us
to
glasgow
to
describe
a
city
so
much
frequented
as
glasgow
is
unnecessary
the
prosperity
of
its
commerce
appears
by
the
greatness
of
many
private
houses
and
a
general
appearance
of
wealth
it
is
the
only
episcopal
city
whose
cathedral
was
left
standing
in
the
rage
of
reformation
it
is
now
divided
into
many
separate
places
of
worship
which
taken
all
together
compose
a
great
pile
that
had
been
some
centuries
in
building
but
was
never
finished
for
the
change
of
religion
intercepted
its
progress
before
the
cross
isle
was
added
which
seems
essential
to
a
gothick
cathedral
the
college
has
not
had
a
sufficient
share
of
the
increasing
magnificence
of
the
place
the
session
was
begun
for
it
commences
on
the
tenth
of
october
and
continues
to
the
tenth
of
june
but
the
students
appeared
not
numerous
being
i
suppose
not
yet
returned
from
their
several
homes
the
division
of
the
academical
year
into
one
session
and
one
recess
seems
to
me
better
accommodated
to
the
present
state
of
life
than
that
variegation
of
time
by
terms
and
vacations
derived
from
distant
centuries
in
which
it
was
probably
convenient
and
still
continued
in
the
english
universities
so
many
solid
months
as
the
scotch
scheme
of
education
joins
together
allow
and
encourage
a
plan
for
each
part
of
the
year
but
with
us
he
that
has
settled
himself
to
study
in
the
college
is
soon
tempted
into
the
country
and
he
that
has
adjusted
his
life
in
the
country
is
summoned
back
to
his
college
yet
when
i
have
allowed
to
the
universities
of
scotland
a
more
rational
distribution
of
time
i
have
given
them
so
far
as
my
inquiries
have
informed
me
all
that
they
can
claim
the
students
for
the
most
part
go
thither
boys
and
depart
before
they
are
men
they
carry
with
them
little
fundamental
knowledge
and
therefore
the
superstructure
can
not
be
lofty
the
grammar
schools
are
not
generally
well
supplied
for
the
character
of
a
being
there
less
honourable
than
in
england
is
seldom
accepted
by
men
who
are
capable
to
adorn
it
and
where
the
school
has
been
deficient
the
college
can
effect
little
men
bred
in
the
universities
of
scotland
can
not
be
expected
to
be
often
decorated
with
the
splendours
of
ornamental
erudition
but
they
obtain
a
mediocrity
of
knowledge
between
learning
and
ignorance
not
inadequate
to
the
purposes
of
common
life
which
is
i
believe
very
widely
diffused
among
them
and
which
countenanced
in
general
by
a
national
combination
so
invidious
that
their
friends
can
not
defend
it
and
actuated
in
particulars
by
a
spirit
of
enterprise
so
vigorous
that
their
enemies
are
constrained
to
praise
it
enables
them
to
find
or
to
make
their
way
to
employment
riches
and
distinction
from
glasgow
we
directed
our
course
to
auchinleck
an
estate
devolved
through
a
long
series
of
ancestors
to
boswell
father
the
present
possessor
in
our
way
we
found
several
places
remarkable
enough
in
themselves
but
already
described
by
those
who
viewed
them
at
more
leisure
or
with
much
more
skill
and
stopped
two
days
at
campbell
a
gentleman
married
to
boswell
sister
auchinleck
which
signifies
a
stony
field
seems
not
now
to
have
any
particular
claim
to
its
denomination
it
is
a
district
generally
level
and
sufficiently
fertile
but
like
all
the
western
side
of
scotland
incommoded
by
very
frequent
rain
it
was
with
the
rest
of
the
country
generally
naked
till
the
present
possessor
finding
by
the
growth
of
some
stately
trees
near
his
old
castle
that
the
ground
was
favourable
enough
to
timber
adorned
it
very
diligently
with
annual
plantations
lord
auchinleck
who
is
one
of
the
judges
of
scotland
and
therefore
not
wholly
at
leisure
for
domestick
business
or
pleasure
has
yet
found
time
to
make
improvements
in
his
patrimony
he
has
built
a
house
of
hewn
stone
very
stately
and
durable
and
has
advanced
the
value
of
his
lands
with
great
tenderness
to
his
tenants
i
was
however
less
delighted
with
the
elegance
of
the
modern
mansion
than
with
the
sullen
dignity
of
the
old
castle
i
clambered
with
boswell
among
the
ruins
which
afford
striking
images
of
ancient
life
it
is
like
other
castles
built
upon
a
point
of
rock
and
was
i
believe
anciently
surrounded
with
a
moat
there
is
another
rock
near
it
to
which
the
drawbridge
when
it
was
let
down
is
said
to
have
reached
here
in
the
ages
of
tumult
and
rapine
the
laird
was
surprised
and
killed
by
the
neighbouring
chief
who
perhaps
might
have
extinguished
the
family
had
he
not
in
a
few
days
been
seized
and
hanged
together
with
his
sons
by
douglas
who
came
with
his
forces
to
the
relief
of
auchinleck
at
no
great
distance
from
the
house
runs
a
pleasing
brook
by
a
red
rock
out
of
which
has
been
hewn
a
very
agreeable
and
commodious
at
less
expence
as
lord
auchinleck
told
me
than
would
have
been
required
to
build
a
room
of
the
same
dimensions
the
rock
seems
to
have
no
more
dampness
than
any
other
wall
such
opportunities
of
variety
it
is
judicious
not
to
neglect
we
now
returned
to
edinburgh
where
i
passed
some
days
with
men
of
learning
whose
names
want
no
advancement
from
my
commemoration
or
with
women
of
elegance
which
perhaps
disclaims
a
pedant
praise
the
conversation
of
the
scots
grows
every
day
less
unpleasing
to
the
english
their
peculiarities
wear
fast
away
their
dialect
is
likely
to
become
in
half
a
century
provincial
and
rustick
even
to
themselves
the
great
the
learned
the
ambitious
and
the
vain
all
cultivate
the
english
phrase
and
the
english
pronunciation
and
in
splendid
companies
scotch
is
not
much
heard
except
now
and
then
from
an
old
lady
there
is
one
subject
of
philosophical
curiosity
to
be
found
in
edinburgh
which
no
other
city
has
to
shew
a
college
of
the
deaf
and
dumb
who
are
taught
to
speak
to
read
to
write
and
to
practice
arithmetick
by
a
gentleman
whose
name
is
braidwood
the
number
which
attends
him
is
i
think
about
twelve
which
he
brings
together
into
a
little
school
and
instructs
according
to
their
several
degrees
of
proficiency
i
do
not
mean
to
mention
the
instruction
of
the
deaf
as
new
having
been
first
practised
upon
the
son
of
a
constable
of
spain
it
was
afterwards
cultivated
with
much
emulation
in
england
by
wallis
and
holder
and
was
lately
professed
by
baker
who
once
flattered
me
with
hopes
of
seeing
his
method
published
how
far
any
former
teachers
have
succeeded
it
is
not
easy
to
know
the
improvement
of
braidwood
pupils
is
wonderful
they
not
only
speak
write
and
understand
what
is
written
but
if
he
that
speaks
looks
towards
them
and
modifies
his
organs
by
distinct
and
full
utterance
they
know
so
well
what
is
spoken
that
it
is
an
expression
scarcely
figurative
to
say
they
hear
with
the
eye
that
any
have
attained
to
the
power
mentioned
by
burnet
of
feeling
sounds
by
laying
a
hand
on
the
speaker
mouth
i
know
not
but
i
have
seen
so
much
that
i
can
believe
more
a
single
word
or
a
short
sentence
i
think
may
possibly
be
so
distinguished
it
will
readily
be
supposed
by
those
that
consider
this
subject
that
braidwood
scholars
spell
accurately
orthography
is
vitiated
among
such
as
learn
first
to
speak
and
then
to
write
by
imperfect
notions
of
the
relation
between
letters
and
vocal
utterance
but
to
those
students
every
character
is
of
equal
importance
for
letters
are
to
them
not
symbols
of
names
but
of
things
when
they
write
they
do
not
represent
a
sound
but
delineate
a
form
this
school
i
visited
and
found
some
of
the
scholars
waiting
for
their
master
whom
they
are
said
to
receive
at
his
entrance
with
smiling
countenances
and
sparkling
eyes
delighted
with
the
hope
of
new
ideas
one
of
the
young
ladies
had
her
slate
before
her
on
which
i
wrote
a
question
consisting
of
three
figures
to
be
multiplied
by
two
figures
she
looked
upon
it
and
quivering
her
fingers
in
a
manner
which
i
thought
very
pretty
but
of
which
i
know
not
whether
it
was
art
or
play
multiplied
the
sum
regularly
in
two
lines
observing
the
decimal
place
but
did
not
add
the
two
lines
together
probably
disdaining
so
easy
an
operation
i
pointed
at
the
place
where
the
sum
total
should
stand
and
she
noted
it
with
such
expedition
as
seemed
to
shew
that
she
had
it
only
to
write
it
was
pleasing
to
see
one
of
the
most
desperate
of
human
calamities
capable
of
so
much
help
whatever
enlarges
hope
will
exalt
courage
after
having
seen
the
deaf
taught
arithmetick
who
would
be
afraid
to
cultivate
the
hebrides
such
are
the
things
which
this
journey
has
given
me
an
opportunity
of
seeing
and
such
are
the
reflections
which
that
sight
has
raised
having
passed
my
time
almost
wholly
in
cities
i
may
have
been
surprised
by
modes
of
life
and
appearances
of
nature
that
are
familiar
to
men
of
wider
survey
and
